[2.04s -> 8.01s]  Hello, good afternoon, morning, or whatever, good, how, wherever you are, hi.
[8.01s -> 17.72s]  Welcome back to the stream, hope you're having a good day. Today we're gonna be playing Lisa.
[18.74s -> 22.90s]  Nope, just kidding, that's never happening. Today we're gonna be playing Doki Doki Literature Club.
[23.54s -> 27.56s]  Nope, just kidding, that's never happening either. Today we're gonna be playing Garfield
[27.56s -> 31.40s]  Cart 2. Just kidding, that's never happening either, that game doesn't even exist. How could it happen?
[35.03s -> 42.81s]  Mystery game today. Fuck you, Lisa's amazing, asshole. I didn't say the game was bad,
[42.81s -> 47.42s]  I just said I'm not gonna stream it. I didn't say, hey, by the way, Lisa the Faithful,
[49.62s -> 56.58s]  sucks. See, not clipped that one. Now I fucked up your clip. I'm gonna clip him saying Lisa the Faithful
[57.46s -> 72.98s]  sucks, you know what I mean? Not gonna happen today. Thanks, Zoidberg. Hey, you're very welcome.
[74.02s -> 84.90s]  Come on in. Everyone's saying Ratatouille. Well, here's the thing about Ratatouille.
[85.88s -> 98.01s]  I promised I would play Ratatouille on the 28th. The problem is, I didn't buy it yet. I said I
[98.01s -> 104.39s]  bought it, I said I owned it, but that was just, it was sitting in my cart, so technically I did
[104.39s -> 121.66s]  own it, temporarily speaking. Liar. He's a liar. That's not how it works. Anyways, so what we're
[121.66s -> 127.78s]  gonna do today is, because it's a mystery game, we just changed the title to something.
[128.50s -> 139.46s]  I'm gonna cue, let's put the title to, please spell that. Please spell that word. All right.
[141.26s -> 147.26s]  Yeah, today we're gonna be playing, I don't know, I can't spell this fucking word.
[148.06s -> 165.05s]  How do you spell this word? Is it one? A? Two A's? No, I keep my fucking promises.
[166.46s -> 181.35s]  Ratatouille! Is that loud? How loud was that? I told you guys I was gonna play this on the 28th.
[184.41s -> 193.70s]  I keep my promises. I keep my promises. I do. This is the original. There's like a bandaid over here.
[195.11s -> 203.22s]  This is Disney Pixar Presents Ratatouille, the video game from THQ. I actually looked this up a
[203.22s -> 209.64s]  little bit. This game apparently is fucking terrible. Every review place gave this game like a four.
[210.28s -> 213.32s]  The game sucks apparently. I don't even know, I don't understand what the joke here is.
[213.88s -> 223.11s]  I think two people said play Ratatouille and I was like, okay, fine. Well, congratulations. You and
[223.11s -> 231.13s]  your friends made me play a game on stream. Hey, Slalom, thanks for the five community subs and
[231.13s -> 240.60s]  for Litty, thanks for five subs too. I appreciate it. I unironically love this game. I don't know
[240.60s -> 244.52s]  why I'm so excited. I'm like, I'm like a lightning rod right now. I'm like ready to go. I don't know
[244.52s -> 253.05s]  why this game's gonna be fucking terrible. You know what's funny? I've never seen this movie.
[253.69s -> 268.28s]  Let's go. Sign in and continue. Yeah, I don't, whatever. Who cares? No storage device has
[268.28s -> 275.91s]  been selected, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine. On the hard drive. You've never seen,
[275.91s -> 279.98s]  I've done, I've never seen this movie. I swear to God. You go, oh, I could go right to the
[279.98s -> 287.26s]  cheats if I want to. Let's play the story. Yes, for those of you that don't know, I just hit,
[288.60s -> 294.84s]  I just hit accept on the first generated name that Xbox gave me. I didn't even care. What the
[294.84s -> 303.42s]  fuck would I even care? Am I, what do I need to be German 985 on here? My Xbox 360? We're about
[303.42s -> 308.54s]  to start a new game. Would you like to continue? Yes. Select the charms for access to other areas.
[308.54s -> 323.13s]  Oh, collect the charms. Okay. Og, this is David's Xbox. Well, it's my Xbox now.
[323.93s -> 331.82s]  Got us some third party sellers. Thanks, Dave. Okay, cool. So, so far so good.
[332.46s -> 338.63s]  Kind of looks like, um, even pinata a little. Does this follow the movie? Do I have to watch
[338.63s -> 353.10s]  the movie if I beat this game? Yeah, you're clean, pal. Move it along. Yes. It's just the movie.
[361.98s -> 366.78s]  Just about dad. Can't a rat work in peace around here? Is that Pat? Wait, is Pat an
[366.78s -> 371.82s]  Oswald the rat in the movie? Cause we got to get those charms collected before her nap time's over.
[373.90s -> 379.96s]  He is? Oh shit. Charms to be collected boys, so get moving. If we're crying out loud,
[379.96s -> 388.74s]  Emil, stop eating all our supplies. What supplies? Keep an eye on your brother. This sucks,
[388.74s -> 394.36s]  turn it off. You know how much of a pain in the ass I was to get this game?
[395.08s -> 399.48s]  Just a pain in the ass, a real pain in the ass. Oh, I thought he was like smelling his butt.
[399.48s -> 407.69s]  I'm not gonna fuck this on and skip it in the beginning cut scene. That's not happening today.
[413.69s -> 417.29s]  You know how much shit people gave me to make sure I played this game on today's date?
[418.25s -> 423.16s]  All right, here we go. Welcome to Remy's home, Mabel's farm. Here you'll learn what your job
[423.16s -> 431.99s]  is in the colony. Ollo, Emilie. Okay. This is a charm. Collect as many as you can to unlock
[431.99s -> 438.39s]  rewards. Press A to jump. Double jump. This is a double jump in the game? All right, that's kind
[438.39s -> 444.78s]  of cool. It's an edge grab. God, remember when Xbox used to just give you fucking achievements
[444.78s -> 450.30s]  for no reason. You know, you can whip your tail to break stuff. Pretty cool, huh? Give it a try.
[451.02s -> 456.84s]  You can even use it on enemies. They just didn't even care. If you can hit them.
[458.44s -> 461.72s]  Jumping on the first stump. Come on, try it out.
[462.44s -> 473.30s]  He's doing it. Tail swipe. Okay, so it's just an attack. Okay, is this game like an hour and a half
[473.30s -> 483.93s]  long? Please say it is. You unlock bonus pack one. It's desync? Me or the game? What do you mean?
[484.81s -> 497.77s]  It should be, it's a game? Game sound is all fucked up. Hey, Jerma, slugpog, thanks for the
[497.77s -> 500.81s]  five community subs. Thanks for being an emote that'll be deleted in about three months.
[502.89s -> 521.35s]  Sound is early. All right. All right. Sounds good, right? All right, let's keep going.
[523.40s -> 526.76s]  Slugpog. I don't even know why it's activated. It's chili peppers.
[539.48s -> 541.72s]  You cook in this game where you just walk around and collect coins.
[545.56s -> 551.61s]  Oh shit, this guy's dead. Go pull us to help him.
[566.81s -> 571.61s]  Pick up an uppers beat. Okay, and then drop it here. Chili peppers can be used to destroy
[571.61s -> 586.30s]  certain objects in the world to defeat enemies. Tail swipe and get away. Okay, cool. It's a little
[586.30s -> 590.14s]  platforming game. Like every single video game that comes out that has a license.
[590.14s -> 593.18s]  Something must be wrong with that wood. Some objects in the world will have a glow
[593.18s -> 596.86s]  outline. That means this means the ready looks like you're gonna need to make your own bridge.
[596.86s -> 605.40s]  What do I do? Try hitting that other plank. I'm convinced that every single movie and TV game
[605.40s -> 613.45s]  that came out from like 1998 to 2010 was all the same engine, same video game that has put
[613.45s -> 618.41s]  different assets sort of in the game world. It's all the same exact game. Oh, I can smell.
[619.37s -> 624.65s]  These things are easy to use. Wrong. It's not wrong. Just jump on and go to town.
[625.61s -> 630.68s]  They just shared the source code with every single movie that was within six months of release.
[630.68s -> 636.20s]  You got to hold down your jump before you release. They changed the coin in this game to like the
[636.20s -> 645.59s]  cheese in another game. The cheese turns into like a star in the other one. Boy Story. Yeah,
[645.59s -> 654.73s]  Toy Story had like fucking action figures instead of coins. Use the same springboard to join me.
[656.70s -> 660.06s]  You can find out where to go next by using your sense of smell. Nice. I'm so glad that
[660.06s -> 672.38s]  there is like a fable to just walk this way. Idiot button. I almost fucked that up. Hold A
[672.38s -> 685.56s]  to compress it. Oh, I see. Speaking of which, German should play Dead Space one and two for
[685.56s -> 691.00s]  October. I actually might do that. Whenever you come to a wall or a pipe, just jump towards it
[691.00s -> 697.80s]  and grab on like this. Why am I playing this game right now? There's like no reason to be playing
[697.80s -> 708.73s]  this. There's so many things I can play right now. Grab, jump, and press B.
[711.45s -> 717.06s]  Okay, how long is the game? Somebody said it was... Oh, that's health. I don't have full health.
[721.16s -> 729.54s]  This game is 40 hours. It's 20 plus hours. No, it is not. The only way this game is 20 plus hours
[729.54s -> 744.36s]  is if level one through 10 was copy and pasted 30 times. A rappel object will work on all swarms.
[747.88s -> 753.16s]  Do I get to use the food? Please tell me I get to cook. You can't make a rat tattoo game
[753.16s -> 755.88s]  and not have cooking. I don't want to just like walk around and spray bugs.
[756.68s -> 766.89s]  Did I die? Oh, okay. I was just waiting for like Dark Souls text to pop up and go like
[767.13s -> 781.99s]  No. The underbuck. All right, now what? Give me more instructions. Chili peppers can be used. Yeah.
[788.70s -> 793.86s]  Oh, God. He's playing this. Yeah, I am. Because when I tell you I'm going to do something,
[793.86s -> 798.87s]  I'm going to do it regardless of how detrimental it is. Let me get the strawberries.
[801.46s -> 810.09s]  I don't hate it yet. I don't hate it yet. I kind of like it. Need another chili pepper. I know what
[810.09s -> 823.21s]  to do. Get up here. Is this it? Okay. Can I ask a question? Is the reason why everybody wants me
[823.21s -> 826.89s]  to play this game regardless of how bad it is? Because this is everybody's favorite movie here.
[828.65s -> 833.05s]  That's why, right? And you overlook how shitty this game is because you love the movie so much.
[833.05s -> 838.81s]  All you care about is like the characters talking. Right? If you want to jump on top,
[838.81s -> 844.41s]  just do this. You're watching like a reunion show, you know, that's a kind of tired and old.
[845.45s -> 850.66s]  But it's still your favorite character. So you like it. Get rid of enemies.
[850.66s -> 858.01s]  Not to mention, it's a whole lot of fun. That has really bad taste.
[858.09s -> 860.65s]  Now let's see if you have as much grace as I do.
[865.18s -> 870.31s]  Use the ball. All right. Jump on the ball and press B and you can squash the bugs.
[870.95s -> 877.50s]  There are surfaces in the world that will hurt you. I can get on. Okay. I can use the ball to
[877.50s -> 885.05s]  jump on surfaces that will hurt me like poison. That's one letter grid coming up. Does this count?
[888.14s -> 897.26s]  No, it doesn't count. The car actually has to turn. Oh, that's too bad. When do I get to grab
[897.26s -> 902.54s]  onto the guy's hair and like fuck with his brain? Like pull his hairs and then give him a headache.
[902.54s -> 907.82s]  When does that happen? So you see the pretty sparkles? Well, jump where they are and you'll
[907.82s -> 914.74s]  end up exactly where you want to be. Cool. Huh? Graphics are actually pretty good.
[916.26s -> 923.50s]  Yeah, they're pretty. They are. They're not bad. Let's see what you got.
[923.50s -> 935.22s]  Jump towards any highlighted point and press B. Use the left stick to balance. Oh, okay.
[935.22s -> 955.08s]  The Tony Hawk manual. Easy. Just play Tony Hawk instead. No, I'm playing Ratatouille.
[959.80s -> 962.12s]  Everybody thought that I was not playing this today too.
[965.59s -> 973.40s]  Everyone was convinced that I didn't buy it. Balance. What the fuck are you doing? No, no,
[973.40s -> 984.68s]  guys. Of course I did. Whoa. Sorry. I don't think you can fail this. This is not failable.
[984.68s -> 991.61s]  All right. Cool. We're good. Climb a pipe. Climb it. All right. I'm interested so far. I'm
[991.61s -> 1009.88s]  interested. Check this out, Remy. Grab it, pull back and release the launcher. It's a flinger?
[1009.88s -> 1019.40s]  Now, watch the master. A fucking eagle just scoops him out of the air with his claws.
[1022.36s -> 1037.74s]  Use the ratapult. Stand underneath it and hold B. Sorry, Remy, but you need 20 charms to proceed.
[1037.74s -> 1044.52s]  What? Did I get soft-locked in the tutorial? What do you mean I need 20 charms?
[1046.71s -> 1067.42s]  I got paywalled? How did that even happen? How did that happen? What? What did I do wrong? I just
[1067.42s -> 1077.99s]  followed his instructions. I missed the coins. I did? I thought I picked them all up. The water
[1077.99s -> 1088.31s]  pump handle is stuck. Try jumping on it for a reward. Oh, there's going to be coins in here,
[1088.31s -> 1105.30s]  right? That'd be... I thought they would just collect... Yeah, I didn't know I needed them.
[1105.30s -> 1122.98s]  I guess I need them. What do I get? Oh, that's a coin. One? Wait a minute. I need 10 more coins.
[1125.43s -> 1142.78s]  10. Did I just run past them? What do you mean 5? Oh, there's a charm hidden in the stump. Blow
[1142.78s -> 1148.95s]  up the box. All right, I get it. No, no, no. I'm supposed to lose here. This is just a tutorial
[1148.95s -> 1154.94s]  to explore and learn and figure out what happened. I need to use the rat on a ball to reach this charm.
[1156.06s -> 1160.10s]  Right. Okay. Where's the rat on a ball? There's a ball. Is there a sprint button?
[1163.26s -> 1166.94s]  You know, Remy, if you just use all four of your hands, you could probably go so much faster than
[1166.94s -> 1183.74s]  this. All right, there's this one. You can dash? Oh, shit, you can. What did I just do? Failed it?
[1183.74s -> 1201.06s]  No, I didn't. Oh, that's fast. This is literally a plot point. Collecting coins? I've never seen
[1201.06s -> 1207.66s]  the movie. I know I'm going to piss off a lot of people when I say this, but I always saw Ratatouille
[1207.66s -> 1213.03s]  as a filler Pixar movie. Like, it was... Oh, yeah, they came up with like three or four every year
[1213.03s -> 1216.39s]  or two, and it was like, oh, this is one of the filler ones. I don't need to watch it. I'm just...
[1216.79s -> 1219.83s]  I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I'm just saying that's how I saw it when it first came out.
[1220.55s -> 1229.83s]  Oh, shit. Cool. What was this? Take that back. Look, I'm not saying that that's accurate. I'm
[1229.83s -> 1239.11s]  just saying that's how I felt. What do I do with this? You know how Pixar and Disney came out with
[1239.11s -> 1243.83s]  a shitload of 3D animated movies? There was like 30 of them over the course of 10 years.
[1245.14s -> 1249.53s]  Some of them, I was like, I don't know. I guess it's all right. I didn't hate the movies or
[1249.53s -> 1256.47s]  anything. Apologize for that. I'm sorry. No. Apologize for what? I didn't say anything.
[1257.35s -> 1264.04s]  Oh, shit. Find the valve and fix the sprinkler. What is this bullshit? I don't want to do this.
[1266.57s -> 1277.86s]  Wait, chili pepper. There's one down here, right? You're a Disney hater.
[1280.89s -> 1284.89s]  Look, once they announce the live action remake of Ratatouille, then I'll care. How's that sound?
[1289.14s -> 1301.54s]  You actually can do that. Oh, well. What? What just happened? Did I die? That was a trap.
[1301.54s -> 1310.12s]  What a rat's got to do. All right. I need more coins. I got that one. I got that one.
[1310.76s -> 1317.46s]  All right. I get that one right there. Daddy will trap. Yeah. What the hell was that?
[1318.42s -> 1325.34s]  All right. What's your, what do you, what do you want to see for a live action remake for Disney?
[1332.65s -> 1341.54s]  Nothing. That's true. Who cares? That's true. That's right. Yeah. Who fucking cares?
[1344.14s -> 1347.26s]  Okay. Once they made the third one in a row, it was like, all right, I don't care anymore.
[1347.26s -> 1352.90s]  This is fucking stupid. You want cars? Okay. That, that would be actually pretty cool.
[1352.90s -> 1363.98s]  I need to find a valve. You would have my attention with a, oh, valve. All right. Wait,
[1363.98s -> 1378.54s]  what happens if a rat fights a squirrel? Imagine looking at what you went to and seeing this in
[1378.54s -> 1383.59s]  the backyard. What do you do? I would freak out. I'd be like, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1384.23s -> 1394.04s]  I would just go out and start clapping my hands. Really? Sucker punch. You fucking piece of shit.
[1394.04s -> 1397.96s]  Nice sucker punch. I kicked your ass for like five straight minutes and then you're going to
[1397.96s -> 1403.56s]  go, my back is turned. Typical fucking squirrel move. Stop. Leave me the fuck alone.
[1404.20s -> 1422.28s]  Give me this thing. All right. Come on. Come here. Get over here. Stop it. Hey.
[1429.06s -> 1437.61s]  That's so stupid. All right. Get me out of this. Blow up the squirrel.
[1439.45s -> 1453.94s]  That's evil. I'm going to blow up the squirrel. All right. So what the hell is that dude? Yeah.
[1453.94s -> 1459.54s]  Well, let me get up there then. Oh, I think, oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[1467.43s -> 1487.54s]  Um, why is it not spraying me? It feels like jump on these. All right. This is fucking dumb.
[1489.38s -> 1497.99s]  I do. I really need to get more coins. What a tutorial this is. All right. I didn't mean that.
[1497.99s -> 1502.87s]  I think there's a friendly. Are you friendly? Yeah. I just hit the no. Oh yeah. Of course not.
[1503.67s -> 1515.19s]  I'll get the chili bomb. Is this what it's like when we're not looking like every like
[1515.19s -> 1520.70s]  toy story and shit. When Andy's not home, the toys have a bunch of fun and they play games with each
[1520.70s -> 1525.82s]  other in the animal world. When the humans aren't looking, they kill each other. They eat each other.
[1525.82s -> 1535.94s]  They rip each other's heads off. Everyone thinks, Oh yeah. When the animals are together, they talk
[1535.94s -> 1540.82s]  and have like fun adventures. None of the rat literally gouges out this little chick's eyes
[1540.82s -> 1545.70s]  with his hands and then eats his brain. They can't make a movie about that though.
[1546.42s -> 1554.66s]  All right. What the fuck am I supposed to do here? Something I can, I can bounce on.
[1555.30s -> 1562.73s]  I need to, Oh, we need to roll in here with the rollie. Wait, I see that guy, this thing up there.
[1563.45s -> 1571.62s]  Oh my a psycho. That's real. That's real life. That's what happens. Like in real life,
[1571.62s -> 1575.70s]  these two would not have a conversation about their taxes. The dove would come down.
[1575.70s -> 1581.46s]  He'd get tail whipped. He'd get bitten in the face. The rat would lose its tail. This other
[1581.46s -> 1584.18s]  rat would come over and start eating the other rat, even though they're both rats.
[1584.98s -> 1601.14s]  I need to get on top of the tractor. No, it isn't Jeremy. You have to go outside.
[1601.14s -> 1609.96s]  What? There's a hole over here. Hold on. Oh, there's a flinger.
[1612.68s -> 1623.11s]  Play chess? Holy shit. Wait, I need to play chess.
[1627.74s -> 1639.11s]  Oh my God. There's like a thousand coins up here. You collect it. Wait, to glide. I can glide.
[1639.83s -> 1646.71s]  How do I glide? Just told me I can glide. Wait a minute. I can do a Mary Poppins.
[1652.06s -> 1672.74s]  Oh, cool. I got 20 charms. I gotta go find Eddie. Rats. You looked in, by the way,
[1672.74s -> 1679.61s]  you looked in your backyard to see this many rats. Eh, probably time to actually put the trash out
[1680.17s -> 1684.17s]  rather than skip it three weeks in a row because you, oh, fuck, I forgot. And it's like already,
[1684.73s -> 1689.45s]  it's like already 8 a.m. I can't get the fucking trash out now. I can already hear the truck
[1689.45s -> 1695.74s]  coming down the street. What am I going to go out there in my underwear? Like hold on a second.
[1699.14s -> 1701.54s]  I've thought about it before, but then you can't. You just can't do it.
[1702.34s -> 1714.23s]  How do I get back up here? Yeah. And then you go over in your head. Is it embarrassing for me to
[1714.23s -> 1720.23s]  go out there with messy hair and underwear and like a pair of socks or not have my trash out?
[1720.23s -> 1726.71s]  Oh, fuck, I don't know. I don't know. What if I get caught on somebody's ring cam?
[1729.90s -> 1730.78s]  I'll wait till next week.
[1731.02s -> 1740.81s]  Well, need your help. With what? This. It's a cookbook by Auguste Gusteau, my favorite chef with
[1740.81s -> 1745.45s]  all sorts of mouthwatering delicacies. Wow. I didn't know you could read.
[1746.74s -> 1749.70s]  Just come on. We'll get it now and I'll tell you more later.
[1751.72s -> 1755.64s]  I'm getting huge bugleberry vibes from that guy right now. Huge.
[1755.64s -> 1778.58s]  Oh, I thought the old lady was shooting a shotgun. She has a shotgun. It is a shotgun.
[1785.43s -> 1798.55s]  Does this happen in the movie? Does this happen in the movie? Oh shit. FPS mode. Run, Remy, run.
[1799.19s -> 1812.87s]  Why does the lady have a gas mask on and a shotgun? This actually does happen in the movie.
[1813.43s -> 1822.47s]  Holy shit. Oh, OK. I have to actually run.
[1823.59s -> 1839.40s]  Make your step and stuff. Get it next time. Go faster. Step in this. OK, it doesn't matter.
[1839.40s -> 1856.42s]  Go. Trying to get her to step in the mousetrap. That doesn't do anything. OK, cool. Those mousetraps
[1856.42s -> 1868.33s]  are from me. Touch that one. That was horseshit. God, no. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my
[1868.33s -> 1888.17s]  God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh no, you lose speed. I'm dead. Being a great chef sure isn't easy.
[1890.46s -> 1896.14s]  Imagine seeing grandma. Yeah, this game so far has been look out your window and be surprised.
[1897.26s -> 1906.42s]  The old lady outside my window shooting at a moving truck with a gun and a gas mask.
[1908.87s -> 1915.11s]  Uh, www.sillo.com and a new apartment in your area that are available now.
[1916.71s -> 1932.38s]  At least I'm a good cook. I got shot by the gun.
[1945.83s -> 1949.80s]  So you're telling me that there's a point in the movie where an old lady with a gas
[1949.80s -> 1955.00s]  mask on is shooting at the rat with a shotgun. You don't want to see this as a live action movie?
[1955.88s -> 1968.49s]  Sure. I didn't think of this one first. What did they do first?
[1969.45s -> 1972.01s]  What was the first live action remake? I'm almost so excited about it.
[1973.53s -> 1987.99s]  Shit. Cinderella. Oh, come the fuck on. Really? What? That thing is just in the way.
[1990.87s -> 1993.19s]  Wasn't Cinderella. Cinderella was like a daytime movie.
[1994.23s -> 1998.71s]  Talk about like a real remake movie. That was like a TV movie.
[2015.58s -> 2021.91s]  Fuck. I'm looking at chat. Somebody said Tarzan. Oh, that was also like a TV movie. Made for TV.
[2021.91s -> 2032.65s]  Cinderella was a made for TV movie. It wasn't in theaters. Stop looking at chat. Oh, well.
[2033.45s -> 2050.34s]  Okay. Honest to God, I'm going to beat this. I can't be one of those people that plays like a
[2050.34s -> 2056.63s]  three hour long licensed movie video game. It takes like three hours to beat, but I spend like
[2056.63s -> 2061.11s]  40. And I walked into that like on purpose somehow. And that one too. I don't even know how. I have
[2061.11s -> 2066.87s]  muscle memory to do a fall joke. I swear to God. I don't even know why. I didn't do anything. I
[2066.87s -> 2091.78s]  was trying to win. Okay. I just tried to jump, but it didn't do shit. Jump. There's enough
[2091.78s -> 2103.77s]  batteries in this fucking thing. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go. How big is grandma's front yard?
[2117.88s -> 2136.02s]  Oh, I had an ammo. Sorry, grandma. Sand Raider. Boom, baby. Collected a health container. Oh,
[2136.02s -> 2153.27s]  so I got extra health. No reloading in the middle of combat. After the sewer, it's time to cook.
[2155.03s -> 2170.74s]  Oh, this looks open and annoying. All right. So does he read the cookbook now or does he already
[2170.74s -> 2177.62s]  know how to cook? And why does the rat already know how to cook? Where's his skillet? Where's
[2177.62s -> 2190.47s]  his fucking burner? Where's his microwave? You're not real. Why am I talking to an
[2190.47s -> 2212.46s]  illustration from a book? Excusez-moi, I am chef Auguste Gusteau. Don't you feel like if you
[2212.46s -> 2216.78s]  grabbed the tip of his head and pulled him up strongly, you'd make him look like a normal
[2216.78s -> 2249.00s]  person. Oh, gross. Feeding chum to dogs on the street. This isn't in the movie.
[2249.16s -> 2260.73s]  My restaurant from five stars to four. Rebuild Gusteau's. I think I can handle that.
[2262.18s -> 2269.99s]  Turn on captions. Is it available? To find a mission. The compass can tell you where to
[2269.99s -> 2275.67s]  find a mission market. Oh, no. You wish to begin a mission. You must start with the mission market.
[2277.91s -> 2282.79s]  I thought a mini mission beacon. What fun. Why don't you try a mini mission?
[2283.75s -> 2290.87s]  Timed challenge. You want? Sure. Great. Two minutes to do something. I guess to follow
[2290.87s -> 2313.66s]  him around. All right, let's go. Timed chaos build. It's kind of slow. It's actually the name
[2313.66s -> 2319.48s]  of a small like three part series I did. I thought it was going to be a huge hit. I thought that was
[2319.48s -> 2328.73s]  going to be a huge hit for the stream. Minecraft was just getting traction. Everybody loved it.
[2333.27s -> 2336.07s]  Didn't really work out so well in my in my head. It was a little different.
[2337.42s -> 2343.46s]  Collect enough of these items and you'll be able to open a tall mission. Wait, I need to collect
[2343.46s -> 2370.52s]  these to get a mission gate. This time gate shit currency gate. Fuck. Wait, why am I so heavy on
[2370.52s -> 2388.78s]  the right? Oh, no, you've lost the race. Let's start over. Oh, it's a race. I thought I was just
[2388.78s -> 2395.98s]  following him, but I kind of need to see where he goes. I don't know where to go.
[2396.86s -> 2407.53s]  Okay, you know what a really, really super pro player jumps off the edge, hangs on the edge,
[2407.53s -> 2411.61s]  jumps up and hang on the edge just because they're bored and they know every inch of every second
[2411.61s -> 2423.14s]  of the game. Pretend I was doing that. It's going to be a long stream. It is not. It's not going to
[2423.14s -> 2429.99s]  be a long stream. I have a finite amount of time I'm willing to give to Ratatouille, the official
[2429.99s -> 2438.87s]  licensed video game stream. I don't know what that is. I'm not sure if it's 20 minutes or well,
[2438.87s -> 2447.94s]  it's been 40. So that's wrong. All right, I'll get it right here. It's been longer than that.
[2448.50s -> 2462.41s]  All right, come on. I can do it. Going to the right. All right, don't fuck this up and I win.
[2462.41s -> 2483.93s]  What the fuck is going on? Collect enough of these. Wait, I'm going to open a tall mission.
[2484.17s -> 2498.58s]  Get it! I win. It does sound like Yoda.
[2509.75s -> 2518.79s]  Not really, though. He did for a second. Supey assistance. All right, cool. I'm looking. Yes,
[2518.79s -> 2522.63s]  I'm ready. I'm ready to have fun now. Here comes an actual cooking mission.
[2524.84s -> 2531.96s]  Oh, Supey mission. I mean, he kind of does. He did one word was like, oh, everything else was not
[2531.96s -> 2547.40s]  Yoda at all, but I get it. The soup is terrible. Use the spices to fix the soup. Knock the cheese
[2547.40s -> 2552.60s]  that is on the top shelf into the bucket below. Complete your tasks and don't let the chefs catch
[2552.60s -> 2559.98s]  you. This is a hidey hole. If you're spotted by a human, you need to run inside of a hole.
[2561.02s -> 2569.67s]  All right, so let's. I know you are hungry, Remy, but can you help that chef make a soup?
[2569.83s -> 2585.21s]  Spice is OK. Sounds like a plan. He said that rat's going to kill me. Oh, fuck, I broke it.
[2590.25s -> 2598.82s]  Oh, they have to go over here. OK. Imagine that. Imagine jumpscare on the guy on purpose.
[2599.54s -> 2606.30s]  You know you can fix that soup. What are you waiting for? It is kind of like Yoda. You're right.
[2607.10s -> 2622.04s]  The same noise I just made. I can't even boil water. Fucking useless. I can do that and I'm stupid.
[2622.76s -> 2645.82s]  All right, where's the next over here? All right, come on, ding. I did. He just saw me. He just
[2645.82s -> 2653.61s]  looked right at me. All right, was this this two more? There's two. All right, there's one across.
[2654.41s -> 2663.43s]  OK, I gotta climb up and then go down. There's one over there. Blind him. You know you can fix
[2663.43s -> 2668.63s]  that soup. What are you waiting for? You've been detected. What are the hidey hole? Tell you where
[2668.63s -> 2684.39s]  the nearest safe area can be found. Hurry, hurry, hurry. What? He's that much of a psycho? Yeah,
[2684.39s -> 2698.79s]  that's it. OK, so can I go from here? Can I jump from here? OK, I know where to go. How long do
[2698.79s -> 2706.41s]  you stay over there for? Oh, up. Hold on. There's one over here. It's an invisible wall, of course.
[2706.41s -> 2722.62s]  Oh, and this is bad. It's really bad. It's really bad. OK, I'm all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.
[2722.70s -> 2732.86s]  You know you can fix that soup. What are you waiting for? Am I stuck down here? A rat's got to do what a
[2732.86s -> 2751.32s]  rat's got to do. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go in the hole. How do I get that
[2751.32s -> 2763.43s]  one? What the fuck are you doing? All right, there it is. Cream. Find a way to tip the ingredients
[2763.43s -> 2771.94s]  into the pot from. Got it. All right, there's only one more. Quickly find a place to hide.
[2776.30s -> 2777.50s]  All right, now backstab him.
[2786.09s -> 2793.26s]  What's his name? This guy's name is Linguini? Like Paul Linguini?
[2796.33s -> 2802.90s]  Fuck. No, turn around, turn around, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, camera, camera, camera, camera,
[2802.90s -> 2812.15s]  camera. I've never seen that. I've never seen the movie. I have not seen this movie.
[2812.23s -> 2816.38s]  Sheesh. The great chef sure isn't easy. I guess I could go that way.
[2818.22s -> 2827.08s]  Which one should I get? The one up top or the one down here? I'm going to get the one down here.
[2827.96s -> 2842.55s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,
[2842.55s -> 2850.09s]  hurry. You know you can fix that soup. Stop shitting up, Yoda. I don't need this force ghost to
[2850.09s -> 2858.34s]  tell me what to do every time. All right, there it is. Got it. Four to four. Now what?
[2864.22s -> 2879.26s]  Now what? You need the last one regardless? You do? I need the cheese. Oh, bullshit. Is that the
[2879.26s -> 2894.18s]  cheese over there? Is this the cheese up here? All right, hold on. I got to distract him. I'm
[2894.18s -> 2906.31s]  going to go, what's that timer? All right, we're good. You know, what can I tell you? I love good
[2906.31s -> 2924.78s]  food. Soupy assistance mission completed. You know, rip out the chef's tongue. Psycho. You,
[2924.78s -> 2939.02s]  that's you. That guy's gonna unlock hidden bonus material. Oh, well done, Remy. Well done. Perhaps
[2939.02s -> 2947.93s]  you can also use your nose to find all the rats. It's a perfect place for a colony of rats.
[2947.93s -> 2954.60s]  I thought I had a condo or something. Is that the end of the movie? He gets like a condo with the
[2954.60s -> 2968.44s]  guy. Thank goodness you're alive. Dad, it's great to see you too. It's dad. But what are you doing
[2968.44s -> 2975.74s]  here? We're here because of your harebrained scheme back at the cottage. It's hard to move.
[2975.82s -> 2983.40s]  I got a condo. I'm sorry, dad, but I'm here now and I want to help. How do you know that but not his
[2983.40s -> 2989.16s]  name? Follow me and we'll get to work. Guys, the main character that's an animal or some mutant or
[2989.16s -> 2994.92s]  alien or something that lives at the end of the movie with the other main character in a weird
[2994.92s -> 2998.76s]  kind of like odd couple scenario, that's half of every fucking movie that's ever existed.
[2999.16s -> 3003.64s]  Aha, there it is. Every Disney Pixar or animated movie that ends like that, always.
[3005.24s -> 3009.80s]  It happens in B-movie. Remember B-movie? He moves in with her in the end of the movie.
[3010.36s -> 3013.08s]  It would be so nice if you could speak to your father.
[3015.50s -> 3029.21s]  Okay, okay. Does that happen in B-movie? Yeah, it does. All right, let's sniff. What's that?
[3029.21s -> 3042.25s]  Trash. Is that auto? Okay, when there's food, any food. If I order like take out or something
[3042.25s -> 3046.41s]  or if I bring back something from cooking, you look over the side of where Otto's bed is and he
[3046.41s -> 3060.90s]  goes, he goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. It's the cutest thing in the world. I kind of
[3060.90s -> 3069.78s]  miss the force ghost guy. Where should I go now? I'm just going to go this way.
[3079.30s -> 3084.84s]  You could speak to your father. Find him. There he is. Okay. Hey, okay. Thank you.
[3088.98s -> 3093.53s]  He's still around. He's going to be a presence the whole game, isn't he?
[3097.19s -> 3117.19s]  All right. Why can I smell my dad? Did I walk by him? Jumping is fun. That's about it.
[3119.78s -> 3125.62s]  Okay, I just put my hand up to my face and like did like a like I'm going to talk to the microphone
[3125.62s -> 3131.14s]  and I like touch my work on like my fucking hands and all and I got it on my face. I didn't like
[3131.14s -> 3134.18s]  that at all. I hated that. I'm not doing that anymore. I don't like to lean in and make like
[3134.18s -> 3138.50s]  a hair. I'm leaning in doing a thing. Doesn't mean I'm going to get water on my face. No,
[3138.58s -> 3146.55s]  I burnt this thing off. It's fine. This is like 8,000 people that just happen to say that. Like
[3146.55s -> 3152.55s]  2,000 of you know what I'm talking about. That's a funny joke. Okay, okay. He's right here.
[3153.67s -> 3160.49s]  How do I talk to my dad? The colony is counting on you to distract that human and get us some
[3160.49s -> 3166.01s]  food. They feed dogs a bucket of scraps in the courtyard every day. We need to get a hold of
[3166.01s -> 3171.61s]  that bucket. Scare the dogs away from the courtyard. An idle rat is a worthless rat.
[3171.61s -> 3176.41s]  Find a coin in the bird's nest and bring it down to the courtyard. Be careful, son.
[3176.41s -> 3180.01s]  They're the gutter of the clutter. Maybe you can help that. I did that one.
[3181.29s -> 3185.13s]  Find all the light bulbs. We need the light bulbs. Live in this place up.
[3186.25s -> 3206.47s]  Oh, God. I got to do all these tasks. There's one cooking mission. Next game, please. I can't. I
[3206.79s -> 3215.21s]  can't. Dude, the next game is... Oh, look. This one already right here. Where's this one?
[3217.21s -> 3225.22s]  No, no, no. I don't want to go back to this stink home. I already did that one. Oh, shit. A cat.
[3228.25s -> 3241.83s]  Don't be afraid. Just go in. I've got a bunch of Xbox 360 and Xbox games back here. Whatever it
[3241.83s -> 3246.54s]  is, it's going to be on Xbox. I'll pull something out. No, I'm playing Ratatouille right now.
[3248.39s -> 3258.70s]  Talk about that later. Get me. Grab something. What's the point of this?
[3261.34s -> 3264.90s]  What's the light bulb one? Oh, the dog. Scared the dog's way. I got it.
[3268.30s -> 3277.24s]  There's my restaurant. Yes, and I'm here to see it. Why am I doing this? Stream the movie.
[3278.20s -> 3294.95s]  I can't stream the movie Ratatouille. How do I get up there? From here? Fuck, there's something
[3294.95s -> 3306.63s]  else here. Stream rationing. No. Hey, that cat just threw a fucking rock.
[3312.79s -> 3317.24s]  This floating thing is called a mission market. All right, that's all I wanted.
[3318.89s -> 3329.50s]  Hair balls you. X-Men Origins waiting room. No, you can't. Listen, I bet you you're the same guy
[3329.50s -> 3335.66s]  that said Ratatouille waiting room with a resident sleeper on it like six weeks ago.
[3335.66s -> 3341.10s]  I bet you you're the same guy. I was playing a game. I was doing something and I saw like
[3341.10s -> 3345.58s]  resident sleeper, resident sleeper, Ratatouille for Xbox 360 waiting room, resident sleeper,
[3345.58s -> 3349.75s]  and now I'm doing it and here you are again. You can't keep moving the goalposts.
[3350.55s -> 3363.69s]  I'm here. Find a way to scare the dog. Yeah, guess what? When I play X-Men Origins, Wolverine,
[3363.69s -> 3367.69s]  whatever it is, the same person is going to come in. They're going to say, oh, man,
[3367.77s -> 3372.49s]  fucking feeding frenzy for popcap.com waiting room. That's not a bad idea.
[3373.21s -> 3383.16s]  I'll take that idea soon. All right, hold on. I gotta wait. This looks kind of hard.
[3391.78s -> 3401.90s]  Wasn't there acid? Saw waiting room. Stop it. Find your way to the other side of the alleyway.
[3402.30s -> 3419.19s]  Yeah. Boom Beach waiting room. Isn't that like an iPhone game? All right, we're good.
[3425.21s -> 3436.50s]  What do I do about this? Oh shit. I know it's a steam valve. Fuck it. God waiting room. Jack
[3436.50s -> 3441.46s]  and Dexter waiting room. I'm okay. I'm going to have to stop you on that one. I'm playing
[3441.46s -> 3445.86s]  Jack and Dexter right now. I may as well. It's just playing the same game.
[3454.10s -> 3467.43s]  I'm going now. It's not timed. Oh shit. Wait, I'm going to fuck this up. No, I'm good.
[3467.99s -> 3473.58s]  I scared the dog. Knock off a tomato can. Peggle waiting room. I played Peggle on stream.
[3474.14s -> 3487.51s]  I've already done that, man. And why did you turn around? What was that for? More Peggle.
[3487.51s -> 3493.90s]  You don't want more Peggle. I know you don't. Because I extreme fevered almost every single
[3493.90s -> 3499.37s]  level the last time I played it. What more can I do to impress you? You can't get like 20 extreme
[3499.37s -> 3502.49s]  fevers in a row and then be like, yeah, I mean, like you could do better than that. No, I can't.
[3503.77s -> 3509.75s]  I cleared five levels in a row with one ball. I can't ever replicate that again.
[3517.91s -> 3529.94s]  Oh shit. That was cool. It's down here. Oh, this is just a way to get back up here.
[3532.60s -> 3554.81s]  A permanent environmental upgrade. I'm a one ball omega low. I'm trying. I'm trying to stand
[3554.81s -> 3562.74s]  with like that. Where you come from with this one. I don't get it. Club Penguin. No, nobody. You
[3562.74s -> 3571.78s]  don't want. OK, the special request video games. I think a lot of you have to understand. OK,
[3571.78s -> 3580.18s]  the special request games. It's really OK right now. There are 82, almost 8300 people here right
[3580.18s -> 3585.66s]  now. Four of you really want me to continue to play this and you're like you got your popcorn
[3585.66s -> 3588.54s]  ready. You were like, holy fuck, I can't believe you playing this. My favorite game ever when I
[3588.54s -> 3596.95s]  was a kid. And that and I'm doing it for you. You'll get yours eventually. You will. You will.
[3598.20s -> 3603.08s]  You're going to say like, oh, dude, remember that game Mischief Makers for the N64? Wow,
[3603.08s -> 3605.96s]  you should play that, dude. I loved that game when I was a kid and I'm going to play it for you.
[3608.26s -> 3622.71s]  One day. I didn't see that. Being a great chef sure isn't easy. It's right on my neck.
[3630.54s -> 3641.42s]  Why even balance? Just fucking go. Onimusha waiting room. Onimusha.
[3642.22s -> 3653.74s]  How do I know what that is? Nice. All right, I'm good.
[3655.40s -> 3666.02s]  Almost there. I don't fuck it up. Being a great chef. I hit B on it and it didn't do anything.
[3668.81s -> 3674.94s]  I didn't miss the coin. Play League of... Okay, that's one thing I will never play.
[3675.66s -> 3680.55s]  I promise. Okay, you know how I said that like four of you are really excited that I'm here
[3680.55s -> 3684.71s]  right now playing this game? There's probably like 3,000 of you here that would be excited
[3684.71s -> 3690.07s]  if I played League. I don't care. I only impress like three people, not like 5,000. I'm sorry.
[3691.75s -> 3704.68s]  Got it. All right. I scared the dog. This is such an elaborate way for me to scare this dog.
[3705.56s -> 3711.58s]  I'm guessing I'm going to keep going. Oh, God. Minigame unlocked. What minigame?
[3714.33s -> 3724.65s]  Play Neverhood. Maybe one day. I kind of like this game though. I'm not kidding.
[3725.70s -> 3729.70s]  Typically by now I would be like, oh yeah, let's do something else.
[3733.94s -> 3740.34s]  No, not today. I kind of like this. It's kind of fun. I don't hate this. What am I doing?
[3746.44s -> 3756.09s]  Find a way to scare the dog. Wait, right here. This is it. I'm not going to kill the dog, right?
[3762.60s -> 3770.54s]  The dog almost just exploded. Oh, now. Wow. Wow. Mission complete.
[3771.26s -> 3778.73s]  Should we do Jinx at the Sphinx? Right. Yeah, that's another one. That's another one. You'll
[3778.73s -> 3790.33s]  see, maybe. Somebody said worst stream contender? Get out of here. I'll give this a request stream
[3790.33s -> 3797.18s]  and get out of here. Ban that guy for real. I'm just like having fun playing Ratatouille.
[3799.51s -> 3816.47s]  Get out of here. He's still playing this? Yeah, I want to play it. It took me. It took me. It took
[3816.47s -> 3822.01s]  me. Hold on. Let me detuber that a little bit. It took me like three months to get this game and
[3822.01s -> 3827.62s]  find it and be like, yeah, I guess I'll pay for $75 for it. No, I'm playing this for like another
[3827.62s -> 3846.63s]  at least 20 minutes. The dog is gone. Yeah, we got dog shortcut unlocked. Those four guys don't
[3846.63s -> 3855.58s]  even exist. Yeah. Oh, they don't? Really? Really? Okay. Let's find out. Let's see. I'm curious. Hey,
[3855.58s -> 3862.41s]  excuse me. Sit down for a second. Let's do a straw poll. Straw poll. Let's see how many. Okay,
[3862.41s -> 3868.97s]  it's more than four. If this gets more than four votes for yes, I like this game, keep playing it,
[3869.69s -> 3876.14s]  then we're good. If this gets less than four votes, I will change to whatever game you want.
[3876.14s -> 3894.95s]  You ready? This poll is called. Here we go. You like this? Yes. No. Here we go. If this gets more
[3894.95s -> 3903.80s]  than four votes. Oh, fuck. All right, we're good. All I'm looking for is four yeses.
[3911.10s -> 3918.06s]  Oh, would you look at that? Two, 300, 500, 600. It's 40% of you guys.
[3921.88s -> 3933.56s]  42%. It's more than four guys, isn't it? Those are bots. Shit, a lot of people are voting on this,
[3933.56s -> 3938.30s]  by the way, and we never get this much participation. It's like 3000 votes right now.
[3938.94s -> 3945.03s]  Find the chili peppers. All right, avoid the thief.
[3945.51s -> 3950.92s]  Ooh, if I have to, but only because the other rats are counting for me.
[3950.92s -> 3963.56s]  Seven boxes left. All right, let's go. People happy. Yeah. Do a new poll. That's 45%. That's
[3963.56s -> 3968.84s]  more than one. Dude, those four guys aren't even here. You're right. No, they were replaced by
[3968.84s -> 3979.42s]  apparently like 1300 people. People have spoken. The majority wants me to stop, but the large
[3979.42s -> 3986.49s]  minority wants me to stay, and that's what we're doing. I never said this was a democracy
[3986.49s -> 3997.54s]  right now. I said this was a one guy moment, and there's 1500 one guys. I'm going to clear the
[3997.54s -> 4017.77s]  gutters. There was gerrymandering. No. Okay, I got to clear the trash. You're distracting me on purpose
[4017.77s -> 4024.41s]  now. You're doing this to me. What is this? Robots? You're distracting me on purpose because
[4024.41s -> 4028.09s]  you know that I'm going to be like, okay, I don't understand what to do or where to go, so we're
[4028.09s -> 4041.51s]  going to play saw. I don't even say that. Guys, even if I put saw in, I don't even know where to start.
[4042.23s -> 4049.21s]  There's like an hour left of saw. All right. Okay. Are you listening? Are you listening? Are you
[4049.21s -> 4065.67s]  listening? I will finish saw tonight. Okay. Are you all right? Are you good? Are you good? All right.
[4068.98s -> 4073.54s]  No way. Yeah. I will finish saw one tonight so that we can prepare for saw two during
[4073.54s -> 4085.98s]  the Halloween October month. Get that back. 24-hour stream. It's only been one hour, so
[4086.86s -> 4097.05s]  no. It's not going to be even close. This game is fucking sick. Actually, it's not even that bad.
[4097.05s -> 4109.67s]  You guys need to give it a real chance. How much was left in saw? Like one to two hours,
[4109.67s -> 4121.77s]  right? There was like less than an hour or two, wasn't there? Four hours? No way.
[4122.49s -> 4142.58s]  Irma's chat fucking sucks, dude. Where did it go? At first, I just gave it. It was like, oh,
[4142.58s -> 4155.00s]  fuck this. All right. I'm going to go a different way. Can I not jump? I'm going to knock them out,
[4155.00s -> 4165.56s]  pick it up, and then run. Here we go. Was it diminishing returns on the stun?
[4166.28s -> 4186.68s]  Fuck out of here. Leave me alone. World of Warcraft. Oh, shit. I can do a double here.
[4187.32s -> 4197.74s]  Please don't tell me I just screwed this up. Did I mess it up? I think I screwed it up.
[4202.30s -> 4207.67s]  Oh, shit. Does it still work? Like Ghostbusters Remastered. I hope this still works.
[4208.55s -> 4226.34s]  Doesn't have to be like in the indicator. Oh, thank you. Oh, I got something. Is there any
[4226.34s -> 4234.38s]  good Ghostbusters game? Yeah. Okay. That Ghostbusters game from like 2008. It was pretty good. It was.
[4234.38s -> 4240.33s]  It was all right. I wouldn't necessarily say it was the greatest game I've ever played. It was
[4240.33s -> 4253.75s]  pretty good. I liked it. It did a good job. Can I drag the box? I don't think I can drag anything.
[4254.31s -> 4259.21s]  I'm really getting another double.
[4261.21s -> 4273.27s]  One clean gutter. Coming up. Luigi's Mansion? Nah. Nah. No, Luigi's Mansion. Not right now.
[4273.83s -> 4285.78s]  Okay, there's only two more boxes and we're good. Oh, how funny is it that I played Mario Sunshine
[4285.78s -> 4294.63s]  on the GameCube and they just decided to HD re-release it. When I saw that, I was like,
[4294.63s -> 4299.51s]  come on, man. It's been like fucking 15 years. Like what are you doing that after I play it?
[4300.23s -> 4305.91s]  Hey, watch the stream. Nintendo watches the streams. Shit, I gotta go the other way.
[4305.91s -> 4324.52s]  It's trash. Is it? Yeah, I guess it's been confirmed that the head of Nintendo of
[4324.52s -> 4337.77s]  Antarctica watches the streams. I've gotten DMs about it. How do I get this over there?
[4341.53s -> 4350.62s]  The hell? Can I not go that way? Can I drop this down? I can't throw it.
[4352.38s -> 4363.13s]  Ow. Fuck. Easy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone, squirrel. Leave me alone.
[4364.47s -> 4367.67s]  Ignite it and then talk. No, I got it right here. All right. Is this the last two, right? Yeah.
[4368.39s -> 4391.11s]  There's one more. Shit. Bro. Bunker ass. Last one's down there. I got it. I know, dude. I have one
[4391.11s -> 4397.69s]  box left. Are you watching the same person? Who are you talking to? It's obviously not me.
[4404.22s -> 4414.76s]  Last one. Oh, I can walk it, right? Turn off the tutorials. Oh, all right. Am I going to die if
[4414.76s -> 4429.43s]  I fall from here? How much fall damage is too much fall damage? Wait, it's exploding. Oh,
[4430.23s -> 4448.63s]  that's annoying. Fucking ruined. It's fine. Yoda is stupid.
[4451.72s -> 4470.84s]  Yoda's not stupid. Yoda's one of the smartest Jedi ever. All right. You cannot let it go at all.
[4472.89s -> 4477.08s]  You cannot let it go at all. It has to be very gentle. I probably shouldn't even get this one
[4477.08s -> 4494.33s]  then. You're stalling for viewers. You think that's going to help me? Stalling in Ratatouille is
[4494.33s -> 4499.78s]  going to help me with viewers? It's the other way around. I can't get this one. This one doesn't
[4499.78s -> 4508.18s]  work. If I drop it, what happens? Of course. Fuck. Whatever. Let's go the other way. Oh, dude. He's
[4508.18s -> 4514.49s]  definitely stalling to lose viewers. That's what you mean. No, you guys aren't going anywhere.
[4519.13s -> 4523.05s]  I just saw baited all of you. Now you're going to stay to the end of the stream.
[4524.02s -> 4526.82s]  You're going to watch all the ads. You're going to watch. You're going to stay the whole time.
[4526.82s -> 4529.86s]  You're going to keep my engagements up because you know saw is coming at some point.
[4530.58s -> 4536.31s]  I've been saw baited. It's going to happen. I'm going to play saw. You know what I am.
[4536.87s -> 4546.25s]  It's not yet. This is like, okay, I'm going to go like activate a bounty for saw
[4546.97s -> 4553.37s]  and the whole time I'm going to be streaming naked. Trying to get like 50,000 viewers here.
[4553.37s -> 4561.30s]  Okay, now let's play saw for the bounty. I have to have as many people there as possible. The
[4561.30s -> 4577.53s]  sponsors think it's cool. I just stream naked for an hour and then I turn the webcam off,
[4577.53s -> 4581.29s]  turn on saw. It's a sponsored stream. There's 50,000 people here. I call this guy that's
[4581.29s -> 4584.25s]  sponsoring the stream. Hey, come look at the stream, man. There's a lot of people here right now.
[4585.72s -> 4591.80s]  Holy shit, man. That was a good idea to like have to sponsor that stream. There's 50,000 people here,
[4591.80s -> 4603.69s]  dude. And then 20 minutes, like 30 minutes later, I get banned. Hey, we're just like checking in.
[4603.69s -> 4608.78s]  We saw that your channel has been like permanently removed. Huge numbers though, by the way.
[4609.50s -> 4618.02s]  Yeah. So what's that payout look like? Um, it's like, it's like $700,000. Okay. Time to retire.
[4618.02s -> 4648.66s]  Goodbye. Oh, what's that? Carrying cash. Oh, nice to have to negotiate that like in your
[4648.66s -> 4656.71s]  contract with a sponsorship or like if you do to claim this. Yeah. Is it okay if I stream like,
[4656.71s -> 4661.67s]  you know, naked for an hour? And then if I hit like 100,000 concurrent viewers,
[4661.67s -> 4666.28s]  because I'm like the naked guy on Twitch, because that's still counts, right?
[4666.92s -> 4689.08s]  If I immediately switch to your game, it has to. What's that for? What's that for?
[4689.88s -> 4696.57s]  Hear me? You play. Oh, I want to play mafia. That's another thing I'm doing. Oh shit. Let's
[4696.57s -> 4700.79s]  do that tomorrow. Let's play mafia tomorrow. The mafia remake. I'm playing that tomorrow.
[4701.43s -> 4711.35s]  Oh yeah. Yeah. Playing mafia remake tomorrow. Good call. Good call. Oh, there's nothing there.
[4711.43s -> 4720.58s]  I'm going to play it anyways, but good call. All right. What are the missions? I have like two or
[4720.58s -> 4739.08s]  three more, right? Yeah. I want to play mafia. I've heard it's good. I've heard it's very,
[4739.08s -> 4744.07s]  very passable, which these days passable means good in the video game industry. Now
[4746.70s -> 4755.43s]  six and a half out of 10 is now a nine in this new world. We're in a video game.
[4761.37s -> 4767.24s]  Olives. Oh, spit them out. Gross. Crush them up into oil. And you got my attention.
[4767.80s -> 4776.79s]  Not whole though. Disgusting. Cutting board calamity. Oh shit. This is a cooking mission.
[4777.43s -> 4789.70s]  Would you date Remy if you were a rat? No. I may. Does somebody say olive eating challenge?
[4789.70s -> 4798.98s]  Or am I making that up? Smash 30 veggies before the time runs out. Oh shit. This is cool.
[4802.79s -> 4817.85s]  Just a trash compactor. Scream dark souls. What is this spam? You should scream dark souls while
[4817.85s -> 4821.13s]  naked and you start the camera resolution at like one by one pixel. And every time you die,
[4821.13s -> 4824.49s]  the resolution doubles. I think it's a great idea. It's like a sword art online,
[4824.49s -> 4827.53s]  but instead of dying in real life, you slowly get exposed to tens of thousands of people all
[4827.53s -> 4844.90s]  over the world. That's quite the challenge. Imagine you would be trying as hard as you could. That
[4844.90s -> 4853.19s]  would be a silent stream. Oh, wait, wait, wait. This is important to think about one by one pixel
[4854.89s -> 4858.65s]  that doubles in resolution quality or that increases in how much percentage
[4859.61s -> 4865.96s]  every time I die. How long would it take before your penile area is visible? How long?
[4867.66s -> 4872.86s]  One times one. How many pixels would it be for you to determine like the actual area?
[4873.90s -> 4881.83s]  Two, two, four, four, eight, eight. It would take like five deaths before I got banned from the
[4881.83s -> 4891.35s]  fucking site. 20 deaths, 32 by 32. But it would have to be like wicked blurry too. And like every
[4891.35s -> 4896.97s]  time you died after it got to like 32 by 32, how many times did I die in dark souls? That's what
[4896.97s -> 4902.94s]  I'm asking. I think I died like a hundred and like 12 times. So not only would it be visible,
[4902.94s -> 4923.05s]  but it would be in 4k by the time that I got to there. So that's not going to work. What a great
[4923.05s -> 4941.61s]  idea. Your penis takes up one pixel. It's so like fucking rude and like weird and gross and unnecessary.
[4947.42s -> 4972.42s]  Have you explored? Oh, okay. Let's keep going. Pixel dick. That's fucking funny. That's funny.
[4972.42s -> 4976.66s]  All right. I don't, whatever. It's a, you clicked on the mature audience thing when you got here.
[4976.66s -> 4985.98s]  You're fine. You are aware. We're all mature audience here. You clicked it. If you collect
[4985.98s -> 5003.72s]  another one, one by one of one pixel webcam that increases in quality, but you're naked. So you
[5003.72s -> 5011.90s]  better not die more than 50 times in whatever game you're playing. That's such an unbelievable.
[5011.90s -> 5026.74s]  That's like such a fucked up. I'm going to throw up. Where am I? I hate this. I hate this so much.
[5026.74s -> 5052.54s]  You have no idea. Where am I? What? All I heard was get it. Oh, this sucks. I don't want to do
[5052.54s -> 5073.83s]  this one again. Come on. This shit. All right. Do it again. Get it next time. Are you going to play
[5073.83s -> 5080.33s]  Hades? They put a huge Easter egg about you in the game. What are you talking about?
[5080.89s -> 5105.34s]  They did. All right. I got to beat this. That's debated. I would, I, why the hell would they,
[5106.30s -> 5119.56s]  what would it, what is it? That's just a monster debate. Is that what you're telling me?
[5120.36s -> 5154.87s]  Come on. I need two more of these damn things. Come on. Oh yeah. Come on. One more. What sloppy
[5154.87s -> 5170.49s]  piece of shit. There's 8,000 people here watching you play ratatouille.
[5171.45s -> 5176.84s]  I mean, yeah, I guess there is that speaks to the quality of the video game.
[5177.56s -> 5183.35s]  Right. That's people you're interested. I'm interested. No, it's not time for saw.
[5183.35s -> 5196.97s]  All right. I'm doing it. Let's go. One, two, three, silence. You have bots. If you, okay.
[5196.97s -> 5202.57s]  If you think that I've been doing this shit for 10 years and at year number 10 is the year that
[5202.57s -> 5240.47s]  I decide to turn on bots. I don't know, man. What? I don't know. Tell you. Come on. All right. Left
[5240.47s -> 5279.53s]  side. Three more. Hey, let's never do that again. I collected cream. Nice job. Twitch
[5279.53s -> 5284.94s]  username here. All right. What was, what was I doing over here? Oh, I cleared the gutters.
[5285.66s -> 5296.86s]  Now what? I didn't get to the next mission. Springboard race. Get to the end. Sure. That's
[5296.86s -> 5322.97s]  right. Oh, this is awesome. Okay. I'm going to do good. Is it okay? Odd watchers skip ahead.
[5322.97s -> 5340.47s]  15 minutes for saw and gamer wort pixel. What? Wait, is that implying that I'm going to show
[5340.47s -> 5348.60s]  my hand in 15 minutes? I'm not going to do that. I need a, where's the, I need a,
[5349.40s -> 5359.11s]  where's the, where's the other missions? I need more missions. I'm going to go back to the rat cave.
[5360.01s -> 5367.56s]  Wait, no, over here. Have I gone over this way? Shit. I can't go that way. Um, should I go?
[5368.28s -> 5373.22s]  No, I'm not doing a wort reveal. That's disgusting. And I don't want you to see that.
[5373.22s -> 5379.16s]  It makes me sick. Thanks for signing up for this trial run of Twitch bot services. And we hope you
[5379.16s -> 5384.33s]  are enjoying your personalized ego boost. I'm going to read the rest of that just because I
[5384.33s -> 5389.45s]  feel like it. You have 30, you have 30 days until your trail is over. If you were enjoying your
[5389.45s -> 5402.87s]  service, sign up for a one year activation plan. It actually, it said trail. I didn't say trial
[5402.87s -> 5415.24s]  wrong. It was trail activate. I should probably like alt tabbed. And you guys saw that I had a
[5415.24s -> 5424.22s]  view bot running and it was like 10 view bots. Like apparently I'm so, I need those extra 10
[5424.22s -> 5436.74s]  people. What am I going to do? Tell me. I want to know the missions, dude. That was a repeated
[5436.74s -> 5440.58s]  joke. Same joke. No, it's not. That's not true. That's not the same joke as last week. The joke
[5440.58s -> 5445.62s]  last week was if I just revealed that I have view bots, not that they were 10. I added to the joke
[5445.62s -> 5461.18s]  from last week. That's not the same joke. It's not a repeat. No, it's not. No, it isn't. That was a
[5461.18s -> 5473.83s]  different, that was a different piece of humor attached to the same idea. And look at the rules,
[5473.83s -> 5481.30s]  guys. Disagreeing with the streamer is a banable offense. Don't do it. I can go up there. There's
[5481.30s -> 5493.35s]  one here. There's a, okay. There's one up there. I'm going to go up there. There's a menu up there.
[5493.35s -> 5504.57s]  I can get it. Okay. Yes. Good stream. Thank you. You think so? Nice. Good. Because if you didn't,
[5506.09s -> 5511.26s]  you know what? I put my finger up and across. You know what I mean? You're banned. You're up.
[5511.82s -> 5532.07s]  Oh, right there. Okay. I see. That way. He's a murderer. No, I'm not. You're missing what I'm
[5532.07s -> 5548.52s]  saying. And I'm dead. I just did an Olympic dive. Okay. I did just say. Worst link. I'm not clicking
[5548.52s -> 5560.52s]  on any links right now. I'm busy. Wait, I got to go. What's the fastest way? Okay. I see. We're
[5560.52s -> 5568.81s]  going this way. The link sucks. Don't worry. I'm not going to soulless Marvel video. So all this
[5568.81s -> 5580.78s]  Marvel 2020 video game waiting room, soulless. Wait, is that the moment where it's the porn actor
[5580.78s -> 5605.99s]  versions of all the people get up there? Yes. What? What do you mean? What? That thing was
[5605.99s -> 5627.54s]  clearly turned off. All right. Do not. We're going to go this way. Wait, coin. Shit. I'm
[5627.54s -> 5634.07s]  actually, I like, I'm starting to actually unironically enjoy this game. You know what
[5634.07s -> 5640.07s]  I mean? I'm unironically enjoying Ratatouille. Is that bad? That's kind of not a bad thing though,
[5640.07s -> 5653.54s]  is it? I don't think so. I got a mini game. It seems like a solid seven and a 10. It's pretty
[5653.54s -> 5662.49s]  solid seven and a 10. This is where I want to be up here. Right there. Mini game.
[5663.13s -> 5674.07s]  Have you explored all of his dreams? Daring dash stage one. Was I lying earlier? I lie every day.
[5674.63s -> 5680.42s]  Sometimes I lie about a lie I already told. So there's a double lie going on and I don't know
[5680.42s -> 5686.26s]  which one I actually tried to put off as real. And I, oh, what do you mean? This one again?
[5687.30s -> 5704.31s]  Didn't I already do this one? I walked too far and went over the edge. That's how well I was doing.
[5704.39s -> 5716.17s]  This one's way harder than the other one. Under, underneath both of those, by the way. Good.
[5717.99s -> 5739.58s]  Hit detection. You know what I'm saying? Hit, hit, hit, hit. All right. This is fine.
[5739.58s -> 5759.24s]  Yes. What'd I get? Chocolat. Great. You don't ever do that to your ear.
[5759.24s -> 5763.16s]  Otto will be up in the bed sometimes and I'll just kind of roll over and I'll feel inside
[5763.16s -> 5773.64s]  of my ear. Just and I'm like, have you explored all of his dream worlds?
[5775.27s -> 5786.54s]  Oh, have I? Nice. Okay. There's another one. The ant army has invaded the courtyard. Clear the
[5786.54s -> 5794.65s]  the courtyard of 10 ants before time runs out the courtyard of the 10 view
[5794.65s -> 5816.86s]  bots they got already lost shit they have the same spider movement pattern and
[5816.86s -> 5834.38s]  binding of Isaac and that's why I hate those enemies huh I could beat the hush
[5834.38s -> 5839.18s]  with my eyes closed but I will get hit in the first room five times by the same
[5839.18s -> 5856.77s]  spider kill this I am anymore three more reminds me of Madagascar I mean they're
[5856.77s -> 5867.54s]  both just licensed video games look that person just came in and what did they

[5912.81s -> 5918.19s]  I've got this height thing under control I remember I played Viking for the
[5918.19s -> 5923.62s]  Xbox 360 and I remember wanting there was like an achievement to kill like
[5923.66s -> 5926.90s]  500 enemies and I was like I'm gonna do that I want to do that I don't think
[5926.90s -> 5931.22s]  this game sucks I don't even care I need to kill these 500 enemies to get the
[5931.22s -> 5937.52s]  achievement because I want it find a way get the coin from the bird's nest in the
[5937.52s -> 5946.74s]  coin to the rain gutter and drop it down actually Viking was kind of good wasn't
[5946.74s -> 5956.30s]  Viking a good game it's kind of fun Viking was like God of War for the ps4
