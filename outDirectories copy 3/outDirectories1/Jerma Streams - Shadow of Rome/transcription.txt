[1.27s -> 9.93s]  Thank you for your patience. I have returned and it looks like, wow, there is pretty unanimous.
[10.49s -> 19.05s]  The secret PlayStation 2 game is actually a, apparently it's a, I've never played it,
[19.05s -> 30.82s]  but it's a really, really, really great game from what I've been told. The secret PlayStation 2
[30.82s -> 51.21s]  video game that we're going to play right now for a little bit is Shadow of Rome, question marks.
[52.92s -> 64.01s]  I didn't even know what it was. We blew it. Shadow of Rome. It's a, a game.
[68.31s -> 75.26s]  Good job. All right, all right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now that you, now that you've opened
[75.26s -> 82.06s]  the box, do you want to revote with Shadow of Rome? Because I didn't know what this was until
[82.06s -> 94.70s]  I went into the closet and looked at it. No, I'm playing it. I'm playing it. You guys picked the
[94.70s -> 103.96s]  mystery box. You, you can't up 70% of you opened up the fucking crate and sorry. Sorry. You didn't
[103.96s -> 114.04s]  get, you didn't get a knife this time or whatever it is people look for now. That was guitar, man.
[117.00s -> 122.65s]  That was very, very fun. A little like two plus hour, a little fun game. We're going to try Shadow
[122.65s -> 132.63s]  of Rome now. Apparently people are already talking shit, but I don't know if you should be. We're
[132.63s -> 138.41s]  going to play I'm Jammer Lambie regardless. We're going to play I'm Jammer Lambie regardless of if
[138.49s -> 146.79s]  that shows up now. We're also going to play both the Parappa games, but who knows this?
[147.43s -> 153.26s]  This could be a very, very, very big deal game. I feel like a lot of people might actually really
[153.26s -> 164.18s]  like this. I don't know. Uh, this is not the original Guitar-O-Man anymore. This is that
[164.18s -> 172.84s]  create a save file. Okay. We'll see if in the first, we'll give it 30 minutes. If in 30 minutes,
[172.84s -> 180.38s]  we can reliably say this, this game sucks. Okay. Then this game contains scenes of violence.
[181.10s -> 197.75s]  Okay. Um, what do I? Not Guitar-O-Man. This is a strategy game. This is a top-down RTS game.
[199.19s -> 215.74s]  This guy's still interested? It's not. Okay. I don't want people to take off because of this
[215.74s -> 222.71s]  setback. This game is going to be fucked up.
[223.27s -> 226.31s]  Continually defending her from hostile neighboring states.
[243.96s -> 249.00s]  As the power struggle ensued in the political arena, the quality of Roman life declined.
[254.02s -> 259.14s]  It was then that a great man appeared and changed the fate of Rome.
[266.30s -> 270.22s]  A most celebrated hero, Rome, Julius Caesar, super villain.
[272.06s -> 277.18s]  Disturbances were squelched and discontent alleviated under his competent dominion.
[278.06s -> 285.80s]  With the rule of Julius Caesar, all who inhabited Rome waited hopefully. I spelled Colosseum so
[285.80s -> 293.83s]  incorrectly years that it can't even, it's not, there's no auto-correct to help me. Colosseum,
[293.91s -> 298.15s]  Colosseum. But it was not to last. Despite her citizen's wishes,
[298.71s -> 312.10s]  Rome was once again sucked into the vortex of violence and destruction.
[312.10s -> 322.97s]  Yeah, it's Colosseum. Colosseum War. What a shitty title. Colosseum War. That's a great iPad,
[322.97s -> 346.31s]  like iPhone game. All right, I'm keeping it okay. Imagine you have to keep the analog in a thing
[346.31s -> 353.27s]  and it's a rhythm game. Did I get killed? Now, wait a minute. Spoilers, by the way,
[353.27s -> 358.97s]  if you don't know about, this is a huge spoiler. I just, I know you, if you're looking at this
[358.97s -> 367.61s]  history class, Caesar gets stabbed. It's a huge part of like the last season. He's, that's the
[367.61s -> 376.42s]  line, yeah. I'm sorry if you've, I just spoiled like history 101 for you. Now you're gonna be
[376.42s -> 385.35s]  pissed because now you know how it ends. We got four options. Violence. Violence on. What do you
[385.35s -> 397.32s]  mean? Violence off. Player cannot cut enemies into pieces. Green blood? Why green blood?
[398.20s -> 407.35s]  Like I don't want to keep green blood on. They're all like aliens. Okay, I want to keep that up.
[409.62s -> 440.60s]  Uh, subtitles on the screen. That's fine. I thought about it, but this is like 2001 hard.
[441.64s -> 451.00s]  It's different. It's not like 2020 hard. This game is insanely hard. What was I thinking?
[451.64s -> 484.86s]  Do I get to choose my weapon? Which one of these guys is me? Opening, opening, opening.
[484.94s -> 502.50s]  What's this really long intro? What's my, what's this guy's name?
[504.18s -> 521.22s]  Kratos? Something like that, right? You're on. I'll explain today's event. First mess. Three
[521.22s -> 528.74s]  potentially lethal rooms await you. The first room is set up battle royale style. You must defeat
[528.74s -> 532.90s]  all your opponents to proceed to the next room. There are a few weapons. Fight it out for them.
[533.86s -> 537.70s]  In the second room is a guard. He's carrying a weapon, so don't let your guard down.
[538.66s -> 541.62s]  In the last room, you'll just have to find out what awaits you there.
[542.42s -> 552.26s]  Okay, so you move with left analog, move camera right analog. Press R3 to center the camera. Good
[552.26s -> 556.66s]  to know. Press circle button when the talk icon is displayed. You can also listen to the conversations
[556.66s -> 566.89s]  of others this way. So circles talk and listen. Did I just, was there a down three rooms? Hey,
[566.97s -> 581.19s]  this won't be easy. What a salvo list. Memo. Defeat the enemies. All right, well, let's just go.
[583.64s -> 593.48s]  Go to the first room. How do I leave? Can I leave? Did you catch all that? No, explain it again.
[595.66s -> 606.36s]  Yep, three rooms. Yes, yes. I wanted to see if I could go down. I understand. Let's let me out.
[608.09s -> 615.02s]  Talk to the masked man by the gate. Can you buy stuff? New recruits enter the arena unarmed.
[615.02s -> 618.38s]  Pick up weapons to defend yourself. If you want to enter with weapons, prove your worth by
[618.38s -> 627.48s]  finishing by winning a few times, okay? Are you ready to enter the arena? Yes. Give the audience
[627.48s -> 638.33s]  a match to remember. Please upgrade the resolution. I can't do that. That doesn't exist. This is,
[638.33s -> 643.94s]  you're, this is 20 years ago. Press the circle button near the desired weapon to pick it up.
[646.36s -> 654.28s]  Okay, why is that guy so huge? Hold R1 to lock onto an enemy and main attack is X,
[654.28s -> 674.58s]  sub attack is circle, is square. Get the big guy first. He's got green blood. He's a fucking
[674.58s -> 682.71s]  science experiment. No, work together. Your weapon will break once its durability reaches zero.
[683.27s -> 686.95s]  Be sure to watch your durability gauge to make sure you aren't left fighting without a weapon.
[687.75s -> 696.41s]  Okay, where's the durability gauge? Oh, there it is. Ow. Is there a dodge? Is there like a dodge roll?
[701.32s -> 707.86s]  Shoulder ram. When unarmed, press the X button while stepping forward to ram the enemy. If you're
[707.86s -> 716.90s]  lucky, he may just lose his grip on his weapon. Shoulder ram. Okay, that's a shoulder ram.
[717.70s -> 747.90s]  No, give me that weapon. Get the, why would you bounce off of somebody? Step on his head. Threat
[747.90s -> 754.79s]  from above. What? What do you mean threat from above? Yeah, I want the weapon. Give me the guy
[754.79s -> 770.98s]  with the weapon. Give me the, give me the weapon. Oh, that guy has it. Steal the enemy's weapon.
[770.98s -> 774.26s]  Sometimes you will end up grabbing hold of the enemy's weapon after you shoulder ram.
[775.22s -> 779.78s]  At that time, repeatedly press X or square to pry the weapon from their hands.
[781.24s -> 793.05s]  I'll get it every time. All right, that guy's dead. Okay, got him. Now, is there any of the weapons?
[793.05s -> 806.79s]  Oh, domino effect. Is this thing already broken? Okay, get attention from the audience.
[807.35s -> 813.02s]  Appeal to the spectators by pressing square and X buttons at the same time. Time it right,
[813.02s -> 817.74s]  and you may just get your hands on a weapon that won't please the audiences with your performance
[817.74s -> 825.64s]  the better your chance of having to throw out a powerful weapon. Give me something. Holy shit,
[825.64s -> 839.94s]  that's big. Anything else? I'll take the grand halberd. What did I do? He's using his arm.
[844.07s -> 858.23s]  That's a guy's arm. Holy shit. Give me another weapon. Cheese. While holding meat, cheese, bread,
[858.23s -> 864.94s]  et cetera, press the square button to eat and restore some health. Tap square to eat faster.
[865.66s -> 884.66s]  Looks like fucking Minecraft. All right, let's go. Who's left? All right, next room. How long do I
[884.66s -> 891.82s]  get to keep the halberd for? Now, this, this, this is a garden here, right? It's not a land mine,
[891.82s -> 900.78s]  is it? Hold L1 to guard. No, give me, are you serious? No, I'm gonna cut this guy in half.
[913.10s -> 922.73s]  End him. Yeah, we're just gonna throw a bow. Give me a bow. Oh, fuck, there's people here.
[926.65s -> 949.91s]  How do you fire the bow? Um, what else dropped? Can I pick this guy up and like throw him? I need
[949.91s -> 963.29s]  a dodge roll. Bad. I got a ram. All right, come here. No, no, no, no, no. What's dodge? What's
[963.29s -> 971.99s]  dodge roll? I know it exists. Kill him. Stab him. What? You have a knife in your hand. Stab him.
[986.74s -> 1009.16s]  Fuck. Can you throw? Give me something. What'd he break? Oh shit. I have no weapon. No. This guy
[1009.16s -> 1021.32s]  back here. He's like having trouble. What do I do? Give me that. No, this guy over. Are you serious?
[1022.36s -> 1025.32s]  I'm gonna get fucking embarrassed by this tired guy with the shield. Really?
[1026.28s -> 1052.23s]  Don't even think about it. No, no, no, no. Pick up that. I need that shield. Oh, give me a fucking
[1052.23s -> 1080.18s]  break. How did that not hit you? Pick it up. Oh my god. Kill him. What's wrong with my head?
[1087.13s -> 1113.50s]  Kill him. Why? Kill him. He's dead. Geez. Give me the new mace. Crawl through a hole?
[1114.30s -> 1122.07s]  Where's the last door? What happens if I lose here? It's more than one of the common criminals. Cowards
[1122.07s -> 1128.33s]  who haven't resolved to fight. I hereby order the execution of these dogs. Let the crowds be
[1128.33s -> 1134.87s]  pleased by their grisly demise. Hold the X button down for a short while and you'll perform a powerful
[1134.87s -> 1206.97s]  attack. There's no cheese. No, I don't want to kill these guys. Where's my choice? He's dodged.
[1209.37s -> 1216.95s]  And actually, where are you guys getting these from? How do you throw that from there? How do
[1216.95s -> 1227.32s]  you- this thing has to be like 200 pounds. Oh, you have another mall.
[1259.64s -> 1262.52s]  All right, give me something faster than this. I- they- hold on.
[1263.32s -> 1285.08s]  Give me this thing. You're in trouble? Hold on. I cut that guy's head off and he peed out of his head?
[1290.81s -> 1314.14s]  Uh oh. Cheese. Give me it. I want more cheese. Watch out. Okay. Just little hits. Small ones.
[1317.06s -> 1338.49s]  Oh, fuck. Stab him. Stab him through the face. Stab him. Really? Stab him. It wouldn't break.
[1341.13s -> 1365.38s]  Anybody got another one of those? Uh oh. Get him down. Shit. Oh, fuck. He almost- why does
[1365.38s -> 1390.50s]  this keep breaking? Everybody loves me. The crowd loves me. Wait, don't I have to like execute that
[1390.50s -> 1395.86s]  doesn't- doesn't see- oh. Yeah. I was gonna say doesn't Caesar put his hand up or hand- thumbs
[1395.86s -> 1447.72s]  down, thumbs up? Not like this. It's Chris Redfield? No. It's- I don't know. Chapter one,
[1447.72s -> 1452.76s]  the wickedness of men. Marvelous madness has invaded not only the wicked but even those who
[1452.76s -> 1476.74s]  are held to be good. Change blood. Red blood. Why would I do that? We want violence. You're getting
[1476.74s -> 1503.67s]  violence. I thought this was a Colosseum game. This better not be a sneak around game. Don't do
[1503.67s -> 1525.38s]  the few days earlier thing and have me sneak around. And here as well. Centurion Agrippa.
[1526.02s -> 1536.74s]  There is no doubt of it. It is certain that it belonged to a Roman messenger, sir.
[1537.38s -> 1549.34s]  Guitar Man was fun, wasn't it? They have been captured. It has not been long since they left.
[1550.06s -> 1579.40s]  We shall separate and look for them. Do I play as the wolf? Rome has embarked on a campaign to the
[1580.04s -> 1584.68s]  Germanic territories in the north, endeavoring to fully secure its realm. During the battle,
[1584.68s -> 1589.64s]  a group of Roman messengers disappeared suddenly while in enemy territory. In order to prevent
[1589.64s -> 1593.64s]  the spread of confidential information, reconnaissance troops have been dispatched
[1593.64s -> 1609.86s]  to the forest of Germania. Wait, this is- press select button to bring up the map screen.
[1610.74s -> 1629.88s]  Player. Enemy. Ally. Target. Item. Weapon. Okay, well, I'm- no, there's no friendly fire.
[1629.88s -> 1632.92s]  I've been to many land and weathered my share of harsh climbs, but I must say that this place
[1632.92s -> 1640.79s]  may well be the worst. All right, well, I'm gonna go over here in this tent because there's a weapon
[1640.79s -> 1659.96s]  in here. I don't know what was in there, but it's not there anymore. He's having a tantrum. Okay,
[1659.96s -> 1666.58s]  well, what's this item then? Change blood. Change blood. I'm not gonna change the blood.
[1667.54s -> 1680.54s]  No, this is a PG-13 stream. Something in there. All right, let's just- I just gotta go this way.
[1684.86s -> 1697.58s]  No, I don't want to get in- I don't want to get in trouble. If my mom comes in in this red blood,
[1697.58s -> 1710.25s]  she's gonna be very concerned, and I'm gonna have to explain. Please call me if you need anything.
[1710.25s -> 1722.41s]  What is it? Tell the men it's time to mobilize. Should I have done that? That is enough. Let us
[1722.41s -> 1741.06s]  move forth. All right, here we go. All right, what happens if I turn into red and then turn
[1741.06s -> 1746.98s]  into green after one hit? Supra attack. Press the X button while holding R1 and pressing the
[1746.98s -> 1751.86s]  left analog stick forward. Press X while holding R1 and pressing the left analog backwards.
[1774.41s -> 1795.83s]  My mom's gonna fucking kill me. How did I do that dodge roll? Supra! Give me that kick. Does
[1795.83s -> 1799.83s]  kick get rid of the shield? That guy's gonna get destroyed.
[1804.30s -> 1820.17s]  That guy went pretty high. Red blood is uninspired. It's the enemy's fort. They must be close.
[1820.89s -> 1831.67s]  I want to go back to the arena. Thank you.
[1836.12s -> 1845.11s]  I was gonna say, that would have been terrible. We must hurry. The cremation of the assassinated
[1845.11s -> 1853.13s]  Julius Caesar took place in the Foro Romano as the raging flames reduced Rome's former ruler
[1853.13s -> 1860.25s]  to ashes. All who looked on were struck by the poignancy of his own too early demise.
[1862.94s -> 1872.04s]  Sugar, spice, and everything. And here comes Cicero, champion of the Senate.
[1873.21s -> 1879.13s]  We, the members of the Senate, have found the man responsible for the grotesque
[1879.13s -> 1894.46s]  betrayal of Julius Caesar. It is the traitor of Rome, Lipsonius. Lipsonius?
[1895.42s -> 1905.70s]  That is Zagreba's father. It cannot be. It is not true. Did not kill Caesar. I would never do such
[1905.70s -> 1917.06s]  a thing. Kill him. Kill him. I shall now announce the successor to the hero Julius Caesar,
[1917.78s -> 1924.90s]  the man who shall ascend as the just ruler of the nation. It's going to be me.
[1926.34s -> 1948.20s]  This does the Maggie. Oh, is that him? People of Rome, as Caesar has expressed in his will,
[1948.84s -> 1955.58s]  Tonius shall step up as his rightful successor. How much money does that,
[1955.58s -> 1964.84s]  how much money does that skin cost? 600 gems? To dedicate my life to the glory of Rome.
[1964.84s -> 1971.38s]  I just, I don't get the cape. It's bullshit. It's not fair. I cannot believe that Lipsonius
[1971.38s -> 1985.45s]  would do such a thing. That really divided chat. Constant fucking conflict. I didn't,
[1985.45s -> 1992.97s]  somebody read it. I didn't. Vipsanius, a murderer. There's got to be more to this story.
[1998.10s -> 2009.51s]  Rome will never know a hero like Caesar. What's that? You're concerned about that wretched criminal.
[2009.51s -> 2020.97s]  Are you a friend of that traitor? Here comes the lore. Caesar may have charmed with his elegance,
[2020.97s -> 2033.40s]  but no one can ignore Antonius's youthful grace. Antonius is the most capable of Caesar's advisors.
[2033.40s -> 2045.37s]  Surely no one will find. All right, well, what do we do? He loves Caesar. He held him in the highest
[2045.93s -> 2054.92s]  regard. Could he have faked his admiration and loyalty? The Senate house is but a stone
[2054.92s -> 2058.84s]  throw away. It's only a moment's journey by foot. That said, I fear the real challenge will be
[2058.84s -> 2076.76s]  found in gaining entry. The Senate house. Yes, leave. This game is not what I thought it was
[2076.76s -> 2087.82s]  going to be. This actually is like a strategy game. I don't know who the fuck I am. Man,
[2087.82s -> 2094.17s]  this is bullshit. I get to play the first 22 minutes as Snake and now I get to be
[2094.17s -> 2103.21s]  riding for the rest of the game. Don't do this shit. Apparently Caesar hated having security
[2103.21s -> 2111.37s]  guards think it would end like this. It's been successful. I mean, pretty cool. Interesting
[2111.37s -> 2139.19s]  lore here, but I mean, I got to get in the Senate house. Yes. Hi. Here we go. What?
[2141.43s -> 2145.35s]  That's a quick way to die. This is not a child's playground.
[2146.07s -> 2151.35s]  He's got a Rolex? What is on his arm? He's got like a fucking nice watch.
[2165.66s -> 2166.54s]  Octavianus.
[2181.98s -> 2192.52s]  Senate meeting. Go home now. Please watch Rome on HBO. It's very good.
[2193.80s -> 2204.26s]  All right. Add. What do you mean add? I just read that. I would have gripped his father,
[2204.26s -> 2212.49s]  slay Caesar. I must speak to the Senate. This must be a misunderstanding. What troubles you,
[2212.49s -> 2227.85s]  young man? Give me like a spear. It's all we want. Who are you? Have you forgotten old Pansa,
[2227.85s -> 2243.11s]  good Octavianus? People still name like Octavianus and like Asperinius or whatever.
[2248.71s -> 2272.47s]  No. How did we get from there to like Dan? Oh, Octavianus. Steve. Hold L2. Oh, it is. What is
[2272.47s -> 2294.10s]  this? L2 is sneak. Oh, fuck sneaking. I missed the stab. Holy shit. He just did the back stab to me.
[2294.10s -> 2316.06s]  He got behind me. Oh, listen to that. Right there. Got it. Give me that. Can't fall off. There's no
[2316.06s -> 2330.98s]  joke there. Sorry, guys. Steve is short for Stevius. No, it is not. We've got a long way to go.
[2331.62s -> 2346.92s]  I think we just started taking off the Eus off of our names. Like, you know, like Jeremiah Eus.
[2348.22s -> 2362.97s]  Then it went to Jeremiah and then it went to Jeremy. That is true. You can throw in this game
[2362.97s -> 2366.89s]  one full letter grid. Press triangle while holding weapon to throw it straight ahead.
[2371.90s -> 2384.20s]  Did I get him? I don't even see what happened. Did I? What? I hit him. Cut this tree down.
[2385.72s -> 2396.06s]  You actually do cut the tree down. That's pretty cool, actually. That doesn't go. He just,
[2398.70s -> 2401.98s]  guys, there's a guy here, you know. Nice work.
[2401.98s -> 2416.89s]  Give me, I want that. I want his torch. What just happened? He just spit in our face.
[2418.82s -> 2437.99s]  There we go. Give me the torch. Get sand. All right, we're reaching about the 30 minute mark.
[2443.62s -> 2463.27s]  It's almost there. Ow. It's fun. It's fun. But it's just not, I don't think it's 2019 fun.
[2475.43s -> 2479.11s]  Like back like 20 years ago, this is probably the best game that ever came out like for the year.
[2479.83s -> 2505.18s]  What's my favorite game of all time? That's too, that's too much of a loaded question.
[2513.06s -> 2515.70s]  I looked at chat, I looked over here and I thought there was an arrow in my head.
[2519.32s -> 2524.65s]  How is it loaded? Because this is that I can't answer it. First person view. Look at this. It's
[2524.65s -> 2533.58s]  got first person mode. Press R to FPV mode. FPV. Just look at how old this is. They couldn't even,
[2533.58s -> 2560.49s]  FPS. First person FPV. You can zoom in and zoom out. All right, so throw. Uh, can you see me?
[2562.98s -> 2577.90s]  Is he shooting arrows? I don't think so. Well, what was that? Throw it back. Quick,
[2577.90s -> 2592.02s]  do something funny. I don't, I'm just kind of, I'm trying to throw a rock at this guy.
[2592.02s -> 2604.49s]  Was that like funny? The rocks are all broken now. Just get out of the, why are you standing in the
[2604.49s -> 2619.59s]  way? These guys, these NPCs don't do anything but just get in the way. No, this way. There you go.
[2619.59s -> 2638.81s]  Fuck off. All right, now burn him. I can't, I can't even see. The sequel to this game became
[2638.81s -> 2652.68s]  Dead Rising halfway through development. Are you serious? That's kind of awesome. That's ridiculous.
[2659.78s -> 2673.38s]  Yeah, the way you throw shit too is to just play Dead Rising. Because this game did so poorly,
[2673.38s -> 2687.78s]  they changed the game mid-development. Are you kidding me? No way. Okay, I, maybe I will play
[2687.78s -> 2695.82s]  Dead Rising. I've, I played Dead Rising like three. Um, there's like 15 people here. I was
[2695.82s -> 2707.18s]  supposed to sneak, I think. Just go in the door. The door is locked. Well, that's fucking horrible.
[2707.18s -> 2736.47s]  I'm dead. Didn't I have two friends? Are they dead? This is it. Don't lock on. Just hit.
[2737.11s -> 2751.10s]  Oh fuck, he's going around me. Give me that. Give me, give me, give me, give me. Don't die.
[2751.66s -> 2763.70s]  All right, I was trying to, wait, can, somebody gonna throw me cheese? From where? All the way
[2763.70s -> 2769.56s]  back? Like in three years? Hold on, so someone's in three years in the future is gonna throw me
[2769.56s -> 2795.08s]  cheese from behind the rock. Die. Die. Die before I play Unjammer Lammy. Secret PlayStation 2 game
[2795.08s -> 2816.18s]  that I forgot I had. It's pretty good. It's, it's pretty good. Nice Resident Evil death screen.
[2818.22s -> 2825.35s]  Time to bring in Lammy. I think it's time to bring in Lammy. I think so. And well, here's the,
[2825.35s -> 2830.39s]  hold on a minute here. This is important. Oh, this, this like sucked. No, no, no, because this
[2830.39s -> 2836.79s]  confirmed that I was going to play Dead Rising 1. If I didn't do this, we would not have come to
[2836.79s -> 2842.07s]  the conclusion that I was going to play Dead Rising 1 on stream. You understand? Like how things,
[2842.07s -> 2853.16s]  there's like cause and effect. It was worth doing this. Imagine, yeah, imagine the timeline
[2853.16s -> 2855.88s]  that would have, I wouldn't have, never would have probably played Dead Rising 1 on stream.
[2856.44s -> 2865.80s]  It was worth doing. Absolutely. Now let's play Unjammer Lammy. Pretty good secret stream.
[2866.52s -> 2882.66s]  I don't even know, where is Unjammer Lammy? Oh, fuck, that's right. It's not here yet. It's
[2882.66s -> 2890.36s]  being delivered like tomorrow. Just kidding. Relax. See, hold on. So the, are you telling me
[2890.36s -> 2898.36s]  the PlayStation 2 can do this? Are you sure? I have like the PlayStation 2 baby. I don't
[2898.36s -> 2904.04s]  have like the big one. Can the little baby PlayStation 2 do it?
