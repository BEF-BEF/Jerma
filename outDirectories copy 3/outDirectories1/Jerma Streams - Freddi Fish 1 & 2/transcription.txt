[1.91s -> 38.30s]  Do you have a custom mechanical keyboard?
[44.42s -> 63.27s]  I like laptop keyboards the most. I just want a laptop keyboard without the top part of the lap.
[68.02s -> 73.14s]  If I could sit here with that sitting right on my lap, I love laptop keyboards. They're the best.
[76.25s -> 82.55s]  Mechanical keyboards, I like them, but I don't know. The fact that you can hear
[82.55s -> 85.91s]  somebody typing on a mechanical keyboard from like three houses down.
[91.05s -> 99.42s]  That's fucked up. I don't think it is. And do I really need a mechanical keyboard?
[100.50s -> 105.66s]  Think about it. Yeah, membrane. Yeah, membrane, mesh, whatever they're called.
[109.43s -> 122.01s]  I like them more. They're more comfortable. Anyways, hi. I'm a little late. Just by a little
[122.01s -> 133.38s]  bit, but whatever. How you doing? Yeah, if I say two guys, you get it. My streams used to start at
[133.38s -> 139.06s]  four. Now if I say two, all right, I'm going to, I'm definitely going to start before four.
[139.06s -> 146.68s]  This is my way to get here before three o'clock. We can hear the poop line. That's actually a green
[146.68s -> 158.94s]  tea. Ban that guy for an hour. You are late by 36 minutes. Please accept my friend request. I don't,
[158.94s -> 160.62s]  I'm not going to accept friend. What are you talking about?
[174.87s -> 178.47s]  You need to accept. I'm not accepting anything except, I'm not accepting anything.
[179.11s -> 185.90s]  It's green tea and it's based. Yeah. It's a green tea powder. And I know it, it is, it is based. What
[185.90s -> 195.62s]  I'm drinking right now is based and I can, I'm safe to say that. Okay. So what are we doing today?
[196.34s -> 203.43s]  First of all, how are you doing? Second of all, we're going to do it with testing the chat again
[203.43s -> 209.51s]  today. A couple of days ago, we made the reference of playing Freddy fish, the entire Freddy fish
[209.51s -> 216.95s]  cinematic universe. And I was told, Oh man, you have to do it. That's going to be so awesome,
[216.95s -> 221.59s]  dude. Please play it. Please. Oh my God. Freddy fish is my childhood. Get in there, dude. Get in
[221.59s -> 226.55s]  there and play Freddy fish. So we're going to find out. A lot of people wanted me to do this.
[227.35s -> 233.45s]  And after about 20 minutes, if all of you are fighting each other, then I'm going to know if
[233.45s -> 244.86s]  this was worth doing. I did not know this, but there are one, two, three, four, five, six,
[244.86s -> 255.26s]  seven Freddy fish games. I thought they were two. I am not going to play all these. I'm not going
[255.26s -> 264.17s]  to play all seven of them. Maybe I'll play one or two or maybe, I don't know. If I get sick of this
[264.17s -> 272.30s]  shit, I'm going to move on to unpacking, which is a chill game where you could decorate a room.
[272.30s -> 277.34s]  You unpack stuff into a room or something. So that should be fun.
[280.26s -> 291.51s]  Play the second one, please. We're starting. I'm sorry. We're starting with the first Thor movie.
[292.23s -> 299.51s]  Okay. You don't, I can't just, you don't just skip to Ragnarok. We got to watch the first two
[299.51s -> 316.62s]  Thor movies, guys. You're going to go insane over this? I don't think so. There's no second Thor
[316.62s -> 327.10s]  movie. There isn't. Isn't there like Thor 2? What's Thor 2? Yeah, there is Thor, the dark world.
[327.66s -> 345.14s]  Yes, there is. It doesn't exist. Okay. So you guys didn't even know that existed. It's the worst
[345.14s -> 350.89s]  movie ever. I don't, I don't remember that movie. I don't even know if I saw it. Did I watch that
[350.89s -> 356.68s]  movie? I don't know. Okay. So here we go. We're going to play Freddy fish. This is Freddy fish
[356.68s -> 361.98s]  in the case of the missing kelp seeds. Mods I want you to do. I want you to monitor the chat
[362.70s -> 371.27s]  for, you know, negativity, swears. I need to see how they enjoy this game. So we're going to monitor
[371.27s -> 375.53s]  for negativity, swear words. I think I almost just, okay, I almost just turned off the stream.
[376.33s -> 382.84s]  That was bad. A member monitored them for negativity, negativity. That's it. That's a
[382.84s -> 403.94s]  lot of syllables. Negativity. Five syllables. Negativity. Fuck this game. Why? We haven't even
[404.02s -> 413.14s]  started playing it. You know what? I'm, I'm going through the first one at least.
[414.74s -> 417.06s]  We're going to have, you're gonna have to vote if you want to see the second one. You guys ready?
[417.70s -> 430.15s]  I, you've been waiting a long time. Let's go. Can you see me? No. Can you see the game?
[430.71s -> 445.90s]  Well, not yet. Hold on. Freddy fish and the case of the missing kelp seeds. Can you hear it?
[446.54s -> 462.65s]  Oh, there he is. No, that's not Freddy. Where am I? Sure thing, Freddy. All right.
[462.73s -> 469.62s]  I'm ready to go. Bye, Freddy. All right. Freddy fish. The curse of the missing kelp seeds.
[470.34s -> 479.74s]  You look like a villain. That's fine. Did you part your hair? No, I didn't. Wait, did I?
[482.52s -> 491.34s]  No, I'm just balding and it's going back. Hi, Jason. Want a flower? Sure. Did any of this matter?
[492.06s -> 499.96s]  Any of this? Thank you. Where are you going, Freddy? I'm bringing. You stay out of trouble.
[501.32s -> 505.24s]  You too. Nice receding hairline, Megalo. Yeah, talk to me when you're 40.
[506.52s -> 511.80s]  You know, stuff like that used to really kind of freak me out and scare me. I don't fucking care.
[512.36s -> 517.35s]  I don't care anymore. Hi, Grandma Grouper. Here's a flower. 10 years ago, I was like,
[517.35s -> 526.79s]  thank you. I don't care. I could go ball tomorrow. I wouldn't. Your treasure chest that
[526.79s -> 536.73s]  holds all the kelp seeds. Yes, Freddy. Look at the garden. It's dying. Classic cartoon comedy.
[536.73s -> 543.77s]  Until we find my treasure chest, we have no food. I'll find your treasure chest, Grandma Grouper.
[543.77s -> 547.85s]  So we can find the treasure chest. Thank you, Freddy. What else do I need to do? Peanut butter
[547.85s -> 554.97s]  and jellyfish sandwich for your journey. Hello. Good luck, Freddy. I don't need to pay attention
[554.97s -> 560.17s]  to this game. I'll find your kelp seeds. I don't need to pay attention to this game. This is every
[560.17s -> 568.15s]  Nick Jr. cartoon in one go. I don't need to pay attention to that. All right, so I got my
[568.15s -> 573.48s]  jellyfish sandwich. I don't need to pay attention. Pay attention to what, Freddy Fish?
[574.74s -> 588.98s]  Fuck this guy. Wait, you think he's fucking funny? All right, so what do I do? Is this too loud?
[591.02s -> 605.51s]  Don't disrespect Freddy Fish. Okay. Ooh, everything's clickable. Hello, Freddy. I'm so worried
[605.51s -> 611.19s]  about the kelp seeds. R1, R1, R1, R1. I'll find your treasure chest, Grandma Grouper. Good luck,
[611.19s -> 619.10s]  Freddy. Don't worry, Grandma Grouper. Okay. So I got to go find, I don't know. I don't remember.
[619.10s -> 624.36s]  I'll run into somebody that can help me. Oh, that's cute. Oh, that's cute.
[627.62s -> 637.61s]  Oh, did you hear that banjo? You can't, don't do initial, wait, you're doing a poll already
[637.61s -> 642.70s]  for an initial impression? We've been playing the game for less than two minutes. Nice comb
[642.70s -> 670.28s]  over, comb over, Andy. How long is this game? Just move backwards five feet, dude.
[671.54s -> 673.78s]  I cried as a kid playing this because I got stuck.
[689.80s -> 695.32s]  Just because that's where the kelp seeds are. If we don't find them soon, all the fish are going
[695.32s -> 701.56s]  to die. I'll help you find them, Freddy. All the fish are going to die if we don't do this.
[702.52s -> 708.97s]  That's okay. That got a little. It says to find Grandma Grouper's treasure chest,
[708.97s -> 712.65s]  go near the beach. Go near the beach. All right. So where's the beach?
[713.53s -> 722.46s]  All right. Let's go this way first. This game is really hard. I doubt it, but that's fine.
[723.78s -> 728.34s]  The bottle ain't here, boss. Maybe somebody else found it first.
[729.78s -> 736.42s]  Maybe somebody else found it first. Of course, someone else found it first, you spongehead.
[736.42s -> 740.34s]  Come on, we got to find that bottle. We're shark bait.
[741.14s -> 755.78s]  Boist. Okay. Pretty good cat puke right at the bat.
[758.26s -> 761.78s]  All right. So now what are we going to go to the beach? Do we go to the crown?
[762.82s -> 779.06s]  Can I read these signs? Click on everything. Click on everything. Nice. Okay. Oh boy. I want
[779.06s -> 784.84s]  to do that one again. I like that one. That's my favorite guy so far. That's my favorite character.
[787.00s -> 796.23s]  One more. No, not even close. One more. That's a good one. That's a good one. I like that one a lot.
[798.66s -> 829.51s]  Just keep going. Okay. What do we do? Push. Pull. Save.
[834.25s -> 835.85s]  So we're going to go in there. Who's in there?
[843.29s -> 847.29s]  Are you happy? Are you happy? I'm just curious. I'm asking. Are you happy?
[847.29s -> 858.68s]  Okay. I'm just checking in. Actually, I am too. This is fun. I like this.
[859.64s -> 880.49s]  So we're going to get a crowbar. Crowbar. Pull. Push. Twist it. What's up?
[884.74s -> 893.45s]  Can I prop this underneath here and crank it? We already have one.
[897.13s -> 901.29s]  I don't get it. I don't get it. How do I do this?
[901.45s -> 906.09s]  We just need to find a bigger boy. I don't get it. I don't want to play. This game is stupid.
[906.09s -> 909.53s]  Fuck this game. I don't get it. I don't understand. They didn't make it clear enough for me.
[911.00s -> 913.40s]  Why don't games make shit clearer? You know what I mean? Anymore?
[915.82s -> 920.09s]  I'm fucking done. That made me feel a little bit better.
[923.69s -> 931.54s]  I don't have the items. We've got to go. Did you find my guppy? Yes, Mrs. Halibut.
[931.54s -> 939.51s]  Gabby's stuck, but he's okay. Oh, goodness. So we're just going to leave.
[939.51s -> 944.34s]  Let's go find the next- I hope we find Grandma Grouper's kelp treasures.
[944.34s -> 949.70s]  All right. Bye. Hopefully your kid's okay. Oh, another bottle. Oh, guys. Look, another bottle.
[950.50s -> 956.95s]  We found a bottle. We just left them. I should have left a sandwich.
[957.67s -> 961.37s]  All right. I'm sorry. If this is me, I'm leaving the sandwich. I'm going to be like, hey,
[962.17s -> 965.66s]  Gary, whatever your name is. This is a peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.
[966.46s -> 971.50s]  This will last you at least a few hours. So if you want it, you know what I'm saying?
[974.34s -> 978.25s]  Why leave the sandwich for him? The note says go to the junkyard.
[978.89s -> 982.97s]  We found another clue to the kelp treasure. All right. Go to the junkyard. Go to the beach.
[982.97s -> 995.82s]  What's that? It's a wooden board. Got it. Let's go save that kid. We found a purple sea urchin.
[995.82s -> 1000.89s]  Urchin. All right. Let's go. This is a Jax moment. Yeah.
[1011.69s -> 1014.09s]  I'm imagining some big crying because I can't beat this.
[1014.17s -> 1021.05s]  Treasure. Well, if you can't find that treasure chest, you're going to have to
[1021.05s -> 1028.33s]  answer to the squid father. Please. I literally did. Not the squid father.
[1028.33s -> 1038.86s]  Oh, that's so sad. That's so sad. Okay, we got a key. Wait, what happened? What happened to them?
[1040.57s -> 1044.33s]  Do I have how much how much stuff do I have in my inventory? I wonder what it will unlock.
[1047.35s -> 1049.83s]  Is this can I have more than this? Or am I going to run out of space?
[1050.47s -> 1056.73s]  We got a raid. Yeah, I miss raids, man. I've been I've been I've been missing raids when they come
[1056.73s -> 1060.81s]  in. People will raid this channel with hundreds of thousands of people and I'll just be like,
[1064.17s -> 1068.26s]  so where are we going? That's rude. I don't want to be rude. Thanks for the raid.
[1068.90s -> 1077.26s]  That's a chippley. Thanks for the raid chippley. Appreciate it. Welcome guys playing Freddy Fish's
[1078.73s -> 1082.25s]  adventure of I don't know whatever this game is. There's like 10 of them. Who cares?
[1082.89s -> 1087.45s]  How do we get the pearl? Do you know how we can get through the shrimp net? You can't get through
[1087.45s -> 1094.97s]  the shrimp net unless you got the super duper duper buka poly gizmo. You can't get the super
[1094.97s -> 1102.09s]  duper duper buka poly gizmo unless you give me a clock. Where are we going to get a clock?
[1102.09s -> 1110.52s]  I like this. Look in the junkyard. A clock? All right, that was cool. The whale bones are over here.
[1110.52s -> 1113.16s]  The super duper what is it? Write it out. The super duper what?
[1114.52s -> 1120.34s]  The super duper. I love a lot of syllables so I found what this one was it?
[1121.06s -> 1128.36s]  The super duper. It's the super duper duper. The super duper duper gully gizmo. Hey, if you get
[1128.36s -> 1137.94s]  the super duper duper gully gizmo, I'll give you a clock. Whatever it is. I want to go back
[1138.58s -> 1146.68s]  to where the that kid was trapped. Did I go the wrong way? How do I go back that way? Where's the
[1146.68s -> 1158.04s]  map? Is there a map? All right, let's go in here. I know I'm doing this for fact.
[1165.05s -> 1176.78s]  I got you. Just wait. Check this out. See ya. Now what do I get?
[1176.78s -> 1190.86s]  Gabby, my Gabby. Thank you both. You're welcome, Mrs. Halibut. Please take this purple sea urchin
[1190.86s -> 1195.18s]  for saving my Gabby. A purple sea urchin. Is that currency down here? Thanks, Mrs. Halibut.
[1197.02s -> 1204.23s]  So I got two. I have two purple sea urchins. What do I do with this? I have two purple sea urchins.
[1204.23s -> 1210.79s]  All right, I gotta go to the beach. I have a key. I've got a sandwich. I've got a conch shell.
[1211.75s -> 1223.37s]  I'm gonna go back this way. Yeah, let's go ahead. Let's go up here. Castle. Conch. Whatever. Wait,
[1223.37s -> 1238.65s]  maybe this guy wants a purple one. I got one of those. All right, let's go.
[1239.53s -> 1242.17s]  Herman, I brought you a new shell that doesn't glow.
[1243.21s -> 1249.13s]  Will he fit into this? That's huge. Freddy, Freddy, Freddy. It's wonderful. Just a second.
[1253.54s -> 1261.13s]  Here, Freddy. Maybe you can use this glowing shell. Thank you, Herman. Good night.
[1263.30s -> 1269.86s]  I don't know why the curfew enthusiasm was playing. That was the exact same way that it starts. It was
[1269.86s -> 1283.48s]  like. Okay, so what can I do with this? It's a glowing shell. Welcome to King Crab's Castle.
[1284.36s -> 1294.20s]  What do I need to get in? Sea urchin. What am I getting? Three of these? Four of these? Five of
[1294.20s -> 1306.73s]  these? And I can do something? Oh, I don't have to. The guards just let you in? Sick. Who's that?
[1311.11s -> 1315.11s]  I'm fucking five years old. I swear to God. I thought that was funny. I thought that was
[1315.11s -> 1326.49s]  genuinely humorous. That's a different person's game. It was cute. Yeah, that's fine. Whatever.
[1326.49s -> 1335.85s]  I don't care. All right, what do you want? Hi, King Crab. Greetings, Freddy and Luther.
[1335.85s -> 1348.65s]  I got to get through season one to enjoy season two, right? Because this is season one. Everyone
[1348.65s -> 1355.78s]  said play season two. Play episode two. We'll see. I actually enjoyed this. I don't hate this.
[1356.42s -> 1375.00s]  I'm having a good time. Feels weird, man. What? My God, what is? Oh, look at these.
[1375.72s -> 1396.97s]  I'm going to try to crash my fucking computer. All right, what do you want? Welcome to my kingdom
[1396.97s -> 1404.01s]  with all my shells and pearls. But what really makes it very grand are all the boys and girls.
[1404.01s -> 1414.89s]  Mm-hmm. Cool. So what do you want? It's grandma's last. It's a key. It's a glowing
[1414.89s -> 1421.19s]  shell. It says to find chest, go to the junkyard. What do we do? What do we do with this? This is
[1421.19s -> 1428.39s]  kind of loud. Let me turn it down. Just a little. I do love my beautiful pearls. Okay, you like
[1428.39s -> 1437.78s]  pearls. So do I bring a pearl, maybe? I do love my beautiful pearls. Give him something. I can't.
[1437.78s -> 1448.36s]  It's grandma's last. All right, well, we're gonna leave. That's too quiet. No, there. All right,
[1448.36s -> 1456.81s]  so I can't do anything here yet. Let's go back. I need to go to the beach. They specifically said
[1456.81s -> 1480.55s]  beach. Oh, shit. Oh, no, it's been three minutes. There. This is a library ass game. This is a
[1480.55s -> 1496.66s]  library ass game. I gotta go find the beach. I have a distinct memory of trying to play these
[1496.66s -> 1504.18s]  games. But I just didn't I didn't understand how to install video games. Back in I want to say like
[1504.18s -> 1508.50s]  DOS. Because here's the thing that you guys don't understand. DOS was a huge pain in the ass.
[1509.77s -> 1518.55s]  I don't know if this was on DOS. This is 94. I want to say like 1991 1992. Maybe DOS. Yeah,
[1518.55s -> 1521.83s]  it's it wasn't just Oh, I'm gonna double click this game on my desktop and it's gonna open.
[1522.47s -> 1529.34s]  You used to have to put the CD like the floppy in, get it to run, go into prompts command prompt
[1529.34s -> 1535.58s]  and get the shit to run. It was actually kind of a pain in the ass for a little kid. I didn't get it.
[1539.21s -> 1544.25s]  Just type CD. No, sometimes it didn't work. Sometimes you have to install it and then run
[1544.25s -> 1550.70s]  the exe from the mounted drive and shit. It was weird. Type slash cheat. That wouldn't work either.
[1551.83s -> 1561.02s]  Let's keep going. You lost to a floppy drive. That was after DOS. It was something. Okay,
[1561.02s -> 1566.62s]  so Windows 3.1 ran on DOS. But sometimes you had to go into DOS to do certain things.
[1567.91s -> 1586.36s]  It was weird. Oh, it's the beach. Do I get that now? Windows 98 actually still ran on DOS.
[1586.36s -> 1596.65s]  Did it really? Should I do something? What do I do? Oh, there's a log.
[1596.65s -> 1598.65s]  On July 14th, there's going to be a baseball stream on this channel.
[1598.65s -> 1606.07s]  It's going to be the Cincinnati Clowns versus the Maryland Magicians.
[1606.07s -> 1608.07s]  I would suggest you stick around for that one. July 14th.
[1608.07s -> 1610.07s]  Oh, I got a key.
[1637.00s -> 1637.80s]  That was a banger.
[1642.28s -> 1658.20s]  I have a question. Crabs always kind of scare me and lobsters too because they have those claws.
[1660.44s -> 1662.92s]  How much damage would those actually do to a human hand?
[1663.08s -> 1665.00s]  You can have my fishing pole.
[1668.71s -> 1674.31s]  If, for instance, a fiddler crab, right? If a fiddler crab went bang on my fingers,
[1674.31s -> 1680.52s]  would they just chop them off? Would it just break the skin? Would it break the bone?
[1680.52s -> 1686.52s]  How bad would it be? I always have this distinct kind of vision in my brain that
[1686.52s -> 1690.44s]  if a lobster gets my finger, it's going to just, it's going to saw it off.
[1696.38s -> 1699.27s]  They could absolutely sever your finger. It depends.
[1700.15s -> 1709.26s]  Damn. It'd be a bad cut. Would you probably keep your thingy?
[1713.69s -> 1715.77s]  What about a pistol shrimp? All right. What did you give me the?
[1716.33s -> 1727.86s]  Oh, all right. So what can I do with that? Whoa. What the hell is this?
[1729.74s -> 1733.98s]  Three buckets of jellyfish. I'll toss the jellyfish to the hungry animals.
[1737.02s -> 1743.30s]  It's feeding time. I could probably do something like, wait, I do it.
[1743.30s -> 1749.77s]  You fed that one, Freddy. What?
[1761.94s -> 1765.30s]  Now it's time to do it on hard. And all of a sudden,
[1765.30s -> 1769.62s]  fucking guitar hero buttons start coming down and through the fire and flame starts playing.
[1770.42s -> 1780.98s]  And they just start running out. You missed one? I don't think it really matters.
[1787.96s -> 1791.85s]  How close can they get? Is this the part that you cried at?
[1793.05s -> 1795.90s]  Is this the part that you cried at? You fed them all.
[1795.90s -> 1799.80s]  Get ready, Freddy. Turtles love jellyfish.
[1799.80s -> 1803.85s]  Yes. Oh, it is getting harder.
[1805.91s -> 1808.39s]  Some animals are worth more points than others.
[1811.18s -> 1815.18s]  I have an infinite amount of ammo, but I mean, technically.
[1815.18s -> 1823.48s]  You did great, Freddy. That was crazy.
[1823.48s -> 1826.47s]  You did great, Freddy. You fed them all.
[1826.47s -> 1829.19s]  There are more hungry animals back there, Freddy.
[1829.19s -> 1831.43s]  Isn't that a scary number? I don't like that number. 23?
[1847.40s -> 1854.74s]  Yeah, it's like a scary number. What are the question marks?
[1854.74s -> 1855.78s]  Good job, Freddy.
[1856.34s -> 1858.34s]  The number 23, right? You fed them all.
[1858.34s -> 1862.31s]  Get ready, Freddy. I think the fish want some food.
[1862.31s -> 1869.40s]  Wait, hold on. The scary thriller Jim Carrey movie, the number 23,
[1870.44s -> 1876.06s]  is not based on any actual real folklore. They just made that up for the movie.
[1890.41s -> 1893.77s]  You did great, Freddy. I'm being dead serious.
[1893.77s -> 1896.41s]  You fed them all. Let's play again, Freddy.
[1896.41s -> 1898.09s]  Turtles love jellyfish.
[1898.09s -> 1902.17s]  No, not they made the number 23 up. I'm saying they make up the folklore
[1902.17s -> 1908.57s]  around how scary the number 23 is. Or is that actually number 23 is seen
[1908.57s -> 1911.77s]  in a lot of different places? My game's lagging.
[1915.99s -> 1919.19s]  So they made that whole thing up for the movie. It was just for the movie.
[1919.19s -> 1923.77s]  What? I am not fucking around.
[1923.77s -> 1925.85s]  I'm telling you the absolute honest to God truth.
[1925.85s -> 1928.17s]  I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie and stuff.
[1928.97s -> 1931.77s]  I thought it was like 13, like unlucky number.
[1931.77s -> 1933.40s]  Okay, I can't go up that far.
[1935.96s -> 1940.30s]  I've actually not done stuff on the 23 dates of months.
[1940.30s -> 1942.30s]  You have all three buckets of jellyfish left.
[1942.30s -> 1945.74s]  I actually thought it was really superstitious folklore or something.
[1945.74s -> 1949.02s]  Make sure you toss the jellyfish into the animal's mouths.
[1953.05s -> 1955.05s]  It was just made up for the movie,
[1955.05s -> 1957.45s]  but I thought it was all these like weird biblical references.
[1958.78s -> 1963.30s]  I thought it was like the Da Vinci code, right?
[1963.30s -> 1968.26s]  Where it's like, oh, Leonardo Da Vinci had a secret map to a treasure in the United States.
[1968.26s -> 1971.86s]  Wait, no, that's a Nick Cage movie called National Treasure.
[1972.42s -> 1975.62s]  Well, you know what I mean? I thought it was something like that.
[1977.06s -> 1979.06s]  I thought it was like a biblical thing. I don't know.
[1981.54s -> 1983.70s]  Okay, I just minimize the game. Stop.
[1983.70s -> 1996.57s]  The number 23 has been directly mentioned several times in the Bible, 14 times.
[2000.41s -> 2002.33s]  The Judge of Israel, 23 years of service.
[2002.33s -> 2005.85s]  It's also worth noting that Jehoah was 23 years old when he inherited the throne
[2005.85s -> 2007.13s]  and became Judah's new king. Interesting.
[2008.73s -> 2011.53s]  Yeah, sorry. So I was right. I was right.
[2014.78s -> 2018.14s]  I was right. So they didn't make this whole thing up for the Jim Carrey movie.
[2019.10s -> 2031.53s]  2 divided by 3 is 666. That's what I'm saying. So what do you mean question marks?
[2031.53s -> 2034.81s]  Yeah, it's an actually biblically accurate scary number.
[2036.58s -> 2050.73s]  What? It's a scary number. Hold on. Is this mic not loud enough?
[2055.54s -> 2057.62s]  Have I thrown 157 of these?
[2057.62s -> 2059.94s]  You still have three buckets of jellyfish left.
[2059.94s -> 2062.10s]  There are more hungry animals back there.
[2068.65s -> 2073.29s]  Dude, you can do that with any number.
[2074.09s -> 2080.12s]  You know what else is really funny about this whole scenario?
[2080.84s -> 2085.32s]  I've never even seen the number 23 with Jim Carrey. I've never seen the movie.
[2086.36s -> 2089.00s]  I just knew it was a scary number movie.
[2091.48s -> 2093.64s]  And I looked it up on Wikipedia and it was like,
[2094.60s -> 2097.48s]  he's scary. Jim Carrey writes it down a million times.
[2097.48s -> 2102.52s]  I think I saw the trailer. I think I saw the trailer and I was scared of the number.
[2104.04s -> 2106.12s]  I swear to God, I really think that's what happened.
[2110.44s -> 2112.31s]  I never even saw the movie.
[2125.51s -> 2129.19s]  I don't even care if I lose. I have 200 points.
[2129.91s -> 2131.67s]  No five-year-old is going to get 200 points.
[2135.38s -> 2141.69s]  I don't want 223. I want 250. I don't want 230.
[2141.69s -> 2147.02s]  This is fine. I want something else. 240 is fine.
[2149.83s -> 2152.39s]  I don't like that number. That's like an odd number.
[2152.39s -> 2154.15s]  I want an even number to 250.
[2156.68s -> 2158.44s]  Okay. I'll touch it.
[2158.44s -> 2165.05s]  You're the best jellyfish tosser I know, Freddy.
[2165.05s -> 2168.36s]  Let's feed some more animals, Luther.
[2168.36s -> 2171.08s]  You have three buckets of jellyfish to feed the animals.
[2171.94s -> 2173.38s]  What are you talking about? I have to do this again?
[2174.26s -> 2176.39s]  Why do I have to do this again? How do I leave?
[2179.32s -> 2181.40s]  I can't click the arrow on the top left.
[2181.40s -> 2184.58s]  All right. I'm just going to lose.
[2184.58s -> 2188.31s]  The number 23.
[2188.87s -> 2190.33s]  Why did it scare me so much?
[2192.44s -> 2194.76s]  I don't care if I lose. Hold on. This is important.
[2205.90s -> 2209.42s]  Make sure you toss the jellyfish into the animal's mouths.
[2219.06s -> 2221.70s]  I'm not trying to play. I'm trying to find this trailer.
[2221.70s -> 2222.82s]  How did I do, Luther?
[2222.82s -> 2224.18s]  Why did this scare me so much?
[2224.18s -> 2226.02s]  Let's feed some more animals, Luther.
[2227.90s -> 2229.42s]  Three buckets of jellyfish.
[2230.92s -> 2235.75s]  It's feeding time.
[2235.75s -> 2237.99s]  Why can I not leave? I'm trying to just leave.
[2245.21s -> 2246.81s]  Too bad, Freddy.
[2246.81s -> 2250.14s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[2258.26s -> 2258.82s]  Wow.
[2258.82s -> 2260.10s]  All right, Freddy. I don't care.
[2260.10s -> 2260.98s]  How do I shut him up?
[2267.24s -> 2268.28s]  How do I get out of this?
[2269.00s -> 2270.68s]  There's something else important going on right now.
[2272.38s -> 2273.90s]  We don't have anymore.
[2273.90s -> 2274.46s]  Okay. I left.
[2274.46s -> 2275.58s]  That was fun, Freddy.
[2275.58s -> 2276.62s]  It sure was.
[2276.62s -> 2278.38s]  All right. Why did this scare the shit out of me so much?
[2278.38s -> 2281.02s]  We better continue our search for grandma grouper's kelp seeds.
[2281.02s -> 2281.66s]  Let's find out.
[2283.18s -> 2284.06s]  I never saw the movie.
[2285.98s -> 2289.35s]  Okay. Let's go.
[2290.63s -> 2297.58s]  Where is this?
[2299.27s -> 2300.07s]  Okay. Let's see.
[2300.07s -> 2301.99s]  Let's see why I was scared of this so much.
[2304.41s -> 2307.14s]  Why does it look like such shit?
[2307.94s -> 2313.18s]  Why was I buying that for you, too?
[2313.18s -> 2315.18s]  Actually, I've had a good long time to flip through it.
[2315.18s -> 2316.22s]  Why don't you give it a try?
[2317.34s -> 2318.70s]  The number 23.
[2318.70s -> 2320.86s]  A heart-wrenching odyssey into paranoia.
[2320.86s -> 2323.34s]  You're the most horrifying metamorphosis ever told.
[2323.34s -> 2324.30s]  I'm buying this for you.
[2325.90s -> 2326.62s]  Chapter one.
[2327.42s -> 2329.10s]  All I could think about was the number.
[2330.78s -> 2332.30s]  I met you when I was...
[2332.30s -> 2333.34s]  23.
[2333.34s -> 2334.70s]  And the day we met was?
[2334.70s -> 2335.98s]  September 14th.
[2335.98s -> 2336.78s]  914.
[2336.78s -> 2338.14s]  14 plus 9 is?
[2338.14s -> 2339.18s]  23.
[2339.18s -> 2340.62s]  Is it all just a coincidence?
[2340.62s -> 2341.26s]  I don't know.
[2344.14s -> 2345.42s]  So what is 23?
[2345.42s -> 2347.58s]  They're 23 axioms to Euclid's geometry.
[2348.14s -> 2351.10s]  The human body consists of 46 chromosomes.
[2351.10s -> 2352.86s]  23 from each parent.
[2352.86s -> 2353.34s]  See?
[2353.34s -> 2354.54s]  Two divided by three.
[2354.54s -> 2355.10s]  Point.
[2355.10s -> 2355.90s]  666.
[2355.90s -> 2356.54s]  Number the devil.
[2357.18s -> 2358.54s]  So is 23 a blessing or a curse?
[2358.54s -> 2359.74s]  243?
[2359.74s -> 2360.94s]  240 pixels?
[2361.98s -> 2363.82s]  I was born at 11, 12 p.m.
[2363.82s -> 2365.10s]  11 plus 12.
[2365.10s -> 2365.66s]  23.
[2365.66s -> 2366.22s]  My birthday.
[2366.22s -> 2366.70s]  23.
[2366.70s -> 2367.18s]  Driver's license.
[2367.18s -> 2367.98s]  It's so strange.
[2367.98s -> 2370.54s]  Imagine if this is 230 p.m.
[2370.54s -> 2371.42s]  It actually kind of is.
[2371.42s -> 2372.22s]  You deserve to come up with minutiae
[2372.22s -> 2374.14s]  and you've drawn wild conclusions from them.
[2375.42s -> 2379.18s]  Word on every 23rd page.
[2379.90s -> 2380.86s]  I warn you.
[2380.86s -> 2381.74s]  Hell is waiting.
[2387.06s -> 2387.54s]  The number.
[2388.34s -> 2389.22s]  What does that mean?
[2389.22s -> 2390.10s]  You know.
[2392.76s -> 2394.44s]  Texas in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[2394.44s -> 2395.24s]  Sorry, I'm scared.
[2395.24s -> 2396.44s]  April 19th.
[2396.44s -> 2397.08s]  You gotta get out.
[2397.08s -> 2398.04s]  It's coming for you.
[2398.04s -> 2399.56s]  4 plus 19 is 23.
[2401.00s -> 2402.28s]  This is not who you are.
[2402.28s -> 2403.96s]  Hiroshima bomb was dropped.
[2403.96s -> 2404.60s]  815.
[2405.96s -> 2407.64s]  8 plus 15 is 23.
[2407.64s -> 2408.84s]  13 years of life.
[2408.84s -> 2409.34s]  No more.
[2411.08s -> 2413.24s]  Don't do this to us.
[2417.78s -> 2418.28s]  See?
[2429.00s -> 2429.32s]  Okay.
[2429.32s -> 2429.96s]  Well, that's it.
[2429.96s -> 2430.60s]  Number 23.
[2433.94s -> 2434.26s]  See?
[2434.26s -> 2435.30s]  Everything's 23.
[2435.30s -> 2435.94s]  That's why.
[2435.94s -> 2436.98s]  That trailer scared me.
[2436.98s -> 2438.74s]  I didn't see the movie, but I was scared of the number.
[2438.74s -> 2439.70s]  So I stopped.
[2439.70s -> 2440.66s]  I started thinking about that.
[2440.66s -> 2441.30s]  Like, wait a minute.
[2442.62s -> 2442.94s]  How many?
[2443.90s -> 2446.22s]  How many waters come in a case of water?
[2446.22s -> 2446.72s]  23.
[2447.26s -> 2448.62s]  So I stopped buying them.
[2448.62s -> 2451.93s]  They had to be 24, 25 in a case of water.
[2451.93s -> 2454.07s]  It started freaking me out.
[2454.07s -> 2465.94s]  You're actually 5 IQ.
[2466.58s -> 2468.55s]  What do you know about my IQ?
[2476.22s -> 2477.34s]  23 IQ.
[2479.13s -> 2479.77s]  I don't know.
[2479.77s -> 2480.49s]  How old was I?
[2481.29s -> 2482.41s]  When did that movie come out?
[2482.41s -> 2484.17s]  Like 20 fucking years ago?
[2484.17s -> 2485.45s]  How old was I?
[2485.45s -> 2486.65s]  I was probably like, I don't know.
[2487.61s -> 2489.13s]  I don't know how old I was.
[2489.13s -> 2490.49s]  I probably was very influenced.
[2493.27s -> 2494.55s]  It was 23 years ago.
[2495.27s -> 2496.31s]  It actually might have been.
[2496.31s -> 2498.23s]  And that's fucked up if it was.
[2498.23s -> 2500.79s]  If it was fucking 23 years ago.
[2500.79s -> 2502.31s]  Quiet now, because that's weird.
[2519.69s -> 2520.81s]  You were 23.
[2525.43s -> 2525.91s]  What?
[2525.91s -> 2527.48s]  I was?
[2532.78s -> 2533.66s]  That's fucked up.
[2533.66s -> 2533.98s]  All right.
[2533.98s -> 2534.78s]  I was 23.
[2535.90s -> 2536.40s]  What?
[2545.11s -> 2548.36s]  It's going to be 2023 next year.
[2550.79s -> 2553.11s]  9 plus 8 plus 5 is 23.
[2553.83s -> 2560.23s]  What?
[2560.23s -> 2561.16s]  It's not.
[2562.10s -> 2569.59s]  It's 22.
[2570.39s -> 2571.03s]  Check your math.
[2574.07s -> 2578.54s]  For a second, I was like, holy shit, this is weird.
[2578.54s -> 2579.10s]  All right.
[2579.10s -> 2579.98s]  I got to finish this game.
[2581.58s -> 2590.62s]  What do I do with this stuff?
[2604.70s -> 2606.54s]  There are 23,000 people watching.
[2607.10s -> 2625.91s]  It's not.
[2625.91s -> 2626.79s]  This is like 17.
[2627.75s -> 2628.63s]  All right.
[2628.71s -> 2630.55s]  I need to go figure some shit out.
[2630.55s -> 2632.15s]  Grandma Grouper's house is over here.
[2633.27s -> 2636.57s]  All right.
[2636.57s -> 2637.45s]  So fishing pole.
[2638.17s -> 2639.21s]  It's a fishing pole.
[2639.21s -> 2640.17s]  What do I do with the fishing pole?
[2643.42s -> 2644.94s]  I actually was scared of that number for a little while.
[2644.94s -> 2645.90s]  This is kind of, it was weird.
[2649.50s -> 2650.14s]  Oh, here we go.
[2650.14s -> 2650.38s]  All right.
[2650.38s -> 2651.90s]  So let's go that way.
[2664.42s -> 2666.42s]  I'm Mr. Starfish.
[2666.42s -> 2666.90s]  I'm Mr. Starfish.
[2666.90s -> 2668.42s]  Your math teacher for today.
[2668.42s -> 2669.54s]  Welcome to class.
[2670.18s -> 2671.30s]  This better not be 23.
[2671.94s -> 2674.26s]  How hard do you want the questions to be?
[2674.26s -> 2680.26s]  I want it to be easy, medium, hard, very hard, or advanced?
[2681.86s -> 2682.90s]  Advanced it is.
[2684.33s -> 2688.81s]  What is 32 minus 20?
[2692.44s -> 2694.04s]  Shit, that's 23 backwards.
[2695.16s -> 2697.70s]  That's 23 backwards.
[2697.70s -> 2699.54s]  And that's how old I was when the movie came out.
[2706.65s -> 2707.37s]  You're right.
[2707.69s -> 2710.09s]  Yay, yay.
[2710.09s -> 2711.69s]  Now try this one.
[2713.16s -> 2718.04s]  What is 84 plus 14?
[2719.08s -> 2723.70s]  Uh, I, um, stop, stop.
[2723.70s -> 2724.34s]  I need to get out.
[2726.10s -> 2726.98s]  Very good.
[2729.56s -> 2732.84s]  We've answered two problems right now.
[2732.84s -> 2735.72s]  Let's try another trying to get you to play Freddy Fish.
[2735.72s -> 2737.72s]  What is six divided by two is 23.
[2738.52s -> 2741.32s]  Three minus 24.
[2748.66s -> 2749.70s]  That's correct.
[2751.46s -> 2753.14s]  Let's do another problem.
[2754.58s -> 2760.74s]  What is the difference of 23 and 21?
[2764.79s -> 2765.51s]  Two.
[2765.51s -> 2766.31s]  You're right.
[2769.08s -> 2770.92s]  Now let's try another.
[2772.18s -> 2777.96s]  How much is 37 minus 21?
[2779.70s -> 2780.34s]  16.
[2784.10s -> 2787.30s]  We've answered five problems right now.
[2787.30s -> 2788.50s]  Try this one.
[2789.91s -> 2792.71s]  What is 88?
[2794.39s -> 2795.51s]  That's correct.
[2796.71s -> 2798.39s]  Here's another equation.
[2799.83s -> 2805.19s]  How much is 42 plus 21?
[2808.87s -> 2809.91s]  That's correct.
[2812.66s -> 2814.90s]  Now let's try another.
[2814.90s -> 2815.86s]  You're the devil in the sky.
[2815.86s -> 2821.86s]  What is the sum of 41 and 23?
[2821.86s -> 2822.90s]  What the fuck, man?
[2825.66s -> 2826.22s]  What the hell?
[2829.86s -> 2830.66s]  You're right.
[2832.02s -> 2833.62s]  Now try this one.
[2834.98s -> 2840.58s]  What is the sum of 54 and 13?
[2842.34s -> 2843.14s]  You're right.
[2843.14s -> 2846.49s]  Let's do another problem.
[2846.49s -> 2847.37s]  I don't want to do another one.
[2848.09s -> 2850.65s]  What is 60?
[2852.33s -> 2853.13s]  You're right.
[2854.92s -> 2856.52s]  Now try this one.
[2858.04s -> 2864.52s]  What is the difference of 97 and 65?
[2871.30s -> 2872.94s]  What's that backwards?
[2872.94s -> 2875.90s]  32.
[2875.90s -> 2877.10s]  That's correct.
[2878.54s -> 2882.98s]  We've answered the ones right.
[2882.98s -> 2884.66s]  Here's another equation.
[2886.12s -> 2891.32s]  What is the difference between 62 and 10?
[2893.98s -> 2895.10s]  That's correct.
[2897.78s -> 2899.06s]  Let's do another problem.
[2899.06s -> 2899.86s]  It says stop.
[2900.82s -> 2901.54s]  How much is...
[2901.54s -> 2903.14s]  I know, but I kind of think I need to get to 23.
[2907.88s -> 2909.80s]  I'm not doing 23 questions, I'm sorry.
[2911.00s -> 2912.12s]  What happened to him?
[2912.12s -> 2913.00s]  Why did he pass out?
[2913.00s -> 2913.64s]  That was weird.
[2913.64s -> 2915.96s]  We found another purple sea urchin.
[2917.00s -> 2917.56s]  Hit stop.
[2922.33s -> 2922.89s]  That's dangerous.
[2922.89s -> 2923.69s]  That's going to hurt someone.
[2927.29s -> 2945.58s]  Oh, there's a bottle.
[2945.58s -> 2946.62s]  Where's the bottle?
[2946.62s -> 2951.62s]  Rich?
[2951.62s -> 2952.50s]  We're going to be rich.
[2954.10s -> 2954.66s]  What's that from?
[2955.46s -> 2956.18s]  Hearthstone, I think.
[2959.93s -> 2960.65s]  Oh, a sandwich.
[2970.14s -> 2971.50s]  It's 323 right now.
[2975.03s -> 2978.63s]  Dogfish don't eat peanut butter and jellyfish sandwiches.
[2978.63s -> 2978.95s]  What?
[2979.67s -> 2984.39s]  There's more than one way to catch a dog.
[2990.86s -> 2991.90s]  We need to get different food?
[2994.84s -> 2998.12s]  I guess we can't get past that junkyard dogfish.
[3009.40s -> 3010.44s]  No, I need different food.
[3022.47s -> 3024.47s]  Okay, so I need a way to feed the dog.
[3025.91s -> 3028.78s]  We need a bone.
[3028.78s -> 3029.58s]  Yeah, but whatever.
[3033.42s -> 3035.26s]  The speedrun of Freddy Fish is 23 minutes.
[3035.26s -> 3036.62s]  I mean, I feel like you're just going to have to...
[3037.42s -> 3039.02s]  It's just clicking from screen to screen, right?
[3039.90s -> 3045.70s]  Okay, let's go up.
[3046.90s -> 3050.63s]  23, I'm fine.
[3056.10s -> 3058.10s]  No one gets past Eddie the eel.
[3059.86s -> 3062.34s]  But we're looking for Grandma Gruper's count treasure.
[3062.98s -> 3066.34s]  If we don't find it soon, all the fish are going to die.
[3068.26s -> 3069.62s]  I've heard that one before.
[3070.18s -> 3073.46s]  Look, kids, why don't you just get out of here before I have to eat you?
[3073.46s -> 3075.46s]  Technically, I'm a snake, right?
[3075.46s -> 3076.26s]  They're not fish, right?
[3076.26s -> 3078.10s]  So technically, you can make a funny thing where you say,
[3078.10s -> 3079.30s]  well, I'm not a fish, Fred.
[3084.12s -> 3085.16s]  It's a glowing shell.
[3093.18s -> 3097.02s]  Grandma Gruper's famous peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.
[3097.02s -> 3099.26s]  I guess I could let you get past.
[3099.26s -> 3101.74s]  Good luck finding Grandma Gruper's count treasure.
[3103.18s -> 3108.90s]  The coast is clear now.
[3108.90s -> 3112.20s]  Okay, let's go.
[3112.20s -> 3114.01s]  Click all the funny things.
[3114.73s -> 3116.01s]  Click all the funny things first.
[3124.97s -> 3125.29s]  Cool.
[3126.76s -> 3127.24s]  Nice.
[3127.24s -> 3129.56s]  That was fucking 3D.
[3129.56s -> 3131.72s]  That was Hue's Revolutionary back in 1994.
[3133.64s -> 3135.08s]  That was revolutionary.
[3135.08s -> 3137.00s]  People would start to scream when it was coming up the screen.
[3142.20s -> 3143.40s]  Oh, it's too dark.
[3143.40s -> 3145.16s]  I'm scared, Freddy.
[3145.16s -> 3148.44s]  We have something that would help us see.
[3148.44s -> 3149.88s]  The game is too loud.
[3150.52s -> 3152.76s]  Oh, it's because we watched the number 23 trailer
[3152.76s -> 3153.96s]  and I turned everything way up.
[3153.96s -> 3154.44s]  I'm sorry.
[3156.06s -> 3156.78s]  I can use this.
[3157.34s -> 3160.06s]  It's better.
[3162.33s -> 3164.73s]  We found another purple sea urchin.
[3166.41s -> 3170.87s]  Cool.
[3171.51s -> 3172.25s]  What about that?
[3172.89s -> 3178.39s]  Is that all that was in here, just sea urchin?
[3180.81s -> 3183.00s]  I don't want to miss anything.
[3183.00s -> 3184.52s]  I've got a whole handful of these.
[3185.96s -> 3189.70s]  Oh, check each one.
[3190.34s -> 3195.03s]  Scared, Freddy.
[3195.75s -> 3196.23s]  I got it.
[3196.95s -> 3199.56s]  That's better.
[3201.32s -> 3207.74s]  This thing's trying to kill somebody.
[3211.62s -> 3212.42s]  What can I do in here?
[3213.78s -> 3214.10s]  Nothing.
[3214.82s -> 3220.02s]  Hold up.
[3220.02s -> 3221.86s]  Jim Carrey himself just cursed you.
[3221.86s -> 3224.82s]  Send this message to 23 of your friends to avoid the curse.
[3229.18s -> 3230.70s]  I was actually scared of that movie.
[3244.31s -> 3244.95s]  Oh, that was cute.
[3247.48s -> 3248.79s]  What about the duck?
[3274.38s -> 3275.90s]  So, did I get what I needed from here?
[3278.06s -> 3279.34s]  Is it just cute things to click on?
[3288.68s -> 3300.02s]  So, I gotta go left.
[3300.82s -> 3302.26s]  The volcano is this way.
[3303.14s -> 3306.04s]  How come Jerma is funnier on the VOD?
[3306.92s -> 3308.90s]  I don't know.
[3308.90s -> 3309.62s]  What are you talking about?
[3313.86s -> 3314.98s]  This is number...
[3314.98s -> 3317.62s]  The gate needs to be opened more before we can get through.
[3318.42s -> 3320.52s]  The gate's almost...
[3320.52s -> 3320.92s]  Look at that.
[3321.88s -> 3324.47s]  The gate's almost...
[3324.47s -> 3325.03s]  Reached through.
[3325.03s -> 3325.51s]  What does that mean?
[3326.07s -> 3327.27s]  All right.
[3327.27s -> 3330.63s]  Should I keep these?
[3330.63s -> 3332.23s]  It's a bucket with five purple sea urchins in it.
[3332.23s -> 3333.11s]  Do I need these anymore?
[3333.11s -> 3333.67s]  Should I keep these?
[3344.30s -> 3344.86s]  Do I need them?
[3345.50s -> 3346.46s]  You don't need them anymore?
[3347.58s -> 3348.50s]  Okay.
[3348.50s -> 3351.29s]  All right.
[3351.29s -> 3352.73s]  So, I got another slot.
[3353.53s -> 3354.49s]  Let's go to the volcano.
[3359.37s -> 3366.52s]  That was sick.
[3367.56s -> 3372.20s]  That was really cool.
[3372.20s -> 3372.92s]  You know what?
[3372.92s -> 3374.28s]  You know, think about this.
[3374.28s -> 3375.32s]  What a fun job.
[3376.28s -> 3378.73s]  Think about how fun this is.
[3380.09s -> 3383.05s]  So, some of the artists and the game director and stuff,
[3383.05s -> 3386.57s]  they sit around and they come up with this piece where,
[3386.57s -> 3389.77s]  look, we got a volcano and some kelp and some rocks.
[3389.77s -> 3390.65s]  And then they go, you know what?
[3390.65s -> 3392.33s]  What happens if you click on them?
[3392.33s -> 3394.65s]  And they come up with these really funny little cool things
[3394.65s -> 3395.93s]  that happen when you click on everything.
[3396.81s -> 3398.73s]  Just with this empty canvas, they go, all right.
[3399.53s -> 3401.29s]  When you click the kelp, they're going to spin around.
[3401.29s -> 3402.57s]  It's going to make a cartoon sound
[3402.57s -> 3403.93s]  and it's going to sneeze out a fish.
[3404.73s -> 3407.05s]  And then it does just that.
[3407.61s -> 3408.25s]  That's really cool.
[3412.23s -> 3413.03s]  This would be fun to do.
[3416.04s -> 3416.68s]  Whoa.
[3416.68s -> 3417.40s]  He almost made it.
[3434.66s -> 3435.06s]  Theater.
[3436.02s -> 3437.14s]  You're an actual child.
[3438.18s -> 3440.50s]  I'm just talking about how the game is interesting.
[3441.30s -> 3445.62s]  It's a fun thing for young kids to be engaged with.
[3446.50s -> 3447.62s]  I'm reviewing the game.
[3455.53s -> 3456.25s]  I like that guy.
[3458.38s -> 3459.26s]  You're 46.
[3460.22s -> 3464.54s]  How old do you think the game director of this game was
[3464.54s -> 3466.06s]  when they made this game?
[3468.74s -> 3473.54s]  Guys, other 10-year-olds don't make games for 10-year-olds.
[3473.54s -> 3476.02s]  It's not that a nine-year-old didn't make this.
[3476.90s -> 3480.82s]  What do you think of making the games?
[3483.03s -> 3485.27s]  It's not like a room full of toddlers
[3485.27s -> 3487.35s]  in oversized suits pretending to be adults.
[3488.15s -> 3489.67s]  A 23-year-old made it.
[3491.67s -> 3492.07s]  Still.
[3497.83s -> 3499.59s]  It's a great show.
[3500.31s -> 3502.62s]  Step right up.
[3503.74s -> 3504.78s]  Oh, I like that one.
[3507.67s -> 3509.37s]  All right, let's go.
[3509.37s -> 3510.81s]  Let's see the show.
[3511.85s -> 3515.46s]  All right, quiet.
[3518.94s -> 3522.38s]  Welcome, girls, boys, and fish of all ages
[3522.38s -> 3524.54s]  to the greatest show under the sea.
[3525.18s -> 3527.66s]  We've got some great acts here today.
[3527.66s -> 3531.02s]  Sure to make your gills quiver with delight.
[3532.06s -> 3536.54s]  So put your fins together for our first fantastic performance.
[3536.54s -> 3537.18s]  Be ready to clap.
[3537.18s -> 3538.38s]  Don't be a fucking rude asshole.
[3539.34s -> 3547.93s]  This better be funny.
[3549.05s -> 3559.75s]  That's it?
[3562.17s -> 3564.33s]  Hey, how much was your ticket?
[3565.99s -> 3567.35s]  Yeah, $39.
[3568.07s -> 3568.47s]  Me too.
[3569.19s -> 3571.32s]  That's not it, right?
[3571.32s -> 3571.88s]  There's more.
[3571.88s -> 3572.44s]  There has to be.
[3573.16s -> 3581.91s]  All right, okay.
[3581.91s -> 3582.55s]  That's the real show.
[3582.55s -> 3595.96s]  This is what we do.
[3595.96s -> 3597.08s]  Why is shushing the show?
[3597.64s -> 3599.59s]  Kick that person out.
[3606.71s -> 3607.99s]  You're going to shush the act?
[3615.16s -> 3616.04s]  All right, that's this guy.
[3624.14s -> 3624.78s]  Geez.
[3625.74s -> 3626.54s]  That guy just got...
[3626.54s -> 3627.34s]  That guy died.
[3629.35s -> 3629.99s]  Geez.
[3630.95s -> 3631.83s]  Sheesh.
[3636.09s -> 3636.89s]  Sheesh.
[3637.77s -> 3641.66s]  You're killing me.
[3644.18s -> 3648.23s]  There's nothing else to do here?
[3653.62s -> 3654.82s]  That was the worst sheesh?
[3655.30s -> 3656.26s]  They're not saying...
[3656.26s -> 3656.82s]  What are they saying?
[3656.82s -> 3658.02s]  They're saying, geez.
[3659.22s -> 3660.46s]  I'll try to get it.
[3670.14s -> 3671.50s]  Sheesh.
[3671.50s -> 3672.86s]  Nobody else did it.
[3672.86s -> 3674.06s]  Why did nobody else do it?
[3676.46s -> 3678.30s]  You all fucking set me up.
[3679.02s -> 3683.19s]  Let's leave.
[3688.15s -> 3690.39s]  There are all kinds of surprises.
[3690.95s -> 3691.83s]  Wait, is it another show?
[3712.62s -> 3722.25s]  That's...
[3723.19s -> 3725.90s]  They were speaking...
[3727.50s -> 3727.90s]  Your...
[3727.90s -> 3729.50s]  Somebody said German East.
[3732.14s -> 3733.58s]  That's a German joke.
[3733.58s -> 3734.46s]  I don't say...
[3735.02s -> 3735.42s]  Please.
[3736.62s -> 3749.67s]  That was fantastic.
[3749.67s -> 3750.15s]  I like that.
[3750.87s -> 3751.67s]  Again, more.
[3760.66s -> 3769.26s]  So why is this act way better than the frog?
[3769.26s -> 3771.34s]  The frog's trying to do a good job.
[3774.89s -> 3776.17s]  This would be a live show if I did it.
[3776.89s -> 3779.82s]  I would get a one-star review.
[3786.71s -> 3788.31s]  I would probably have the worst rated show.
[3789.11s -> 3789.99s]  It would be like...
[3791.94s -> 3793.78s]  It would be like 15% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[3794.50s -> 3797.96s]  It was like the German 985 comedy special.
[3797.96s -> 3800.44s]  They would have 15% on Rotten Tomatoes
[3800.44s -> 3805.32s]  and a 60% audience score.
[3806.04s -> 3806.76s]  You know what I mean?
[3807.88s -> 3810.36s]  We can pretend it was all right, but not all of us.
[3810.36s -> 3811.48s]  Not all of us are going to do that.
[3815.45s -> 3816.25s]  Oh, there's another one.
[3857.48s -> 3859.40s]  All right, if I'm going to have to rate the performances here...
[3860.68s -> 3861.40s]  Wait, there's more.
[3871.91s -> 3873.67s]  Holy shit, that was fucking phenomenal.
[3874.23s -> 3875.43s]  That was absolutely phenomenal.
[3875.43s -> 3876.23s]  That's the best one so far.
[3876.95s -> 3878.31s]  That's the best one so far, without a doubt.
[3878.71s -> 3880.39s]  Without a single doubt in my mind.
[3883.26s -> 3884.70s]  And that was only one-third of the act.
[3885.50s -> 3892.06s]  The nuances, the different...
[3892.06s -> 3894.06s]  The nuance difference between that and the first one.
[3894.06s -> 3895.10s]  Holy shit, man.
[3896.06s -> 3899.48s]  The different kind of order that those played out in.
[3899.48s -> 3901.80s]  It's just such a small difference, but it made a big difference.
[3902.92s -> 3903.42s]  One more.
[3904.12s -> 3912.98s]  The end of that one spoke directly to me.
[3914.09s -> 3916.57s]  Because it wasn't just a cut-off clip of a frog.
[3916.57s -> 3917.45s]  It was the whole sound.
[3918.09s -> 3920.22s]  You finally get to hear the whole sound effect.
[3921.78s -> 3922.89s]  There's more.
[3923.77s -> 3966.09s]  Everybody has three.
[3966.57s -> 3967.61s]  Everybody has three acts.
[3968.57s -> 3980.23s]  How many are these?
[3980.23s -> 3981.59s]  The Flying Carp Brothers?
[3982.31s -> 4000.74s]  That's not even that.
[4000.74s -> 4001.14s]  They're swimming.
[4001.14s -> 4002.18s]  That's not even hard.
[4002.18s -> 4003.14s]  What you're doing is not hard.
[4004.26s -> 4005.38s]  I don't know about this one.
[4005.94s -> 4019.94s]  That's an F.
[4019.94s -> 4022.65s]  That's an F.
[4022.65s -> 4024.01s]  Sorry, I don't even want to see the next one.
[4024.97s -> 4031.67s]  No, that's an F.
[4031.67s -> 4032.17s]  It is.
[4041.21s -> 4041.88s]  Perfect.
[4042.89s -> 4043.39s]  Love it.
[4048.46s -> 4048.96s]  What?
[4049.34s -> 4050.06s]  Are you serious?
[4050.70s -> 4052.47s]  They didn't give him a chance.
[4052.47s -> 4053.19s]  Get back out here.
[4056.73s -> 4057.23s]  That's you.
[4070.01s -> 4073.51s]  I don't agree with the audience.
[4073.51s -> 4075.11s]  I think I don't agree with the audience at all.
[4077.37s -> 4077.87s]  Don't agree.
[4078.33s -> 4082.38s]  This is puffo.
[4084.68s -> 4089.90s]  I don't get it.
[4092.36s -> 4100.79s]  I don't get it.
[4108.62s -> 4109.90s]  Everybody in the audience, y'all.
[4109.90s -> 4112.62s]  Fucking threw you a tomato at the turtle.
[4112.62s -> 4113.34s]  It didn't deserve it.
[4114.06s -> 4114.86s]  I still got mine.
[4126.41s -> 4127.69s]  Bump and gump.
[4128.33s -> 4146.55s]  Do they have any more?
[4146.55s -> 4147.75s]  Or is that it?
[4151.05s -> 4152.57s]  And their sign has graphics.
[4157.72s -> 4158.28s]  Other...
[4158.28s -> 4160.20s]  A lot of other people had more than one act.
[4160.20s -> 4161.96s]  So I'm gonna have to deduct points from that one.
[4166.15s -> 4168.31s]  Okay, so what do we got?
[4168.31s -> 4169.99s]  Frank the Fabulous Frog is...
[4173.83s -> 4175.91s]  Okay, Helga was S-ed here at number one.
[4180.04s -> 4180.68s]  What was this one?
[4189.50s -> 4190.38s]  All right, this is all right,
[4190.38s -> 4193.82s]  but you're just a worse version of the guy with the shells.
[4195.74s -> 4196.24s]  Where are they?
[4197.10s -> 4197.66s]  This one, right?
[4200.82s -> 4204.58s]  Yeah, to me, just the worst version of Luke Fishvon
[4204.58s -> 4205.14s]  Bastovid.
[4207.93s -> 4209.37s]  Yeah, I mean, I felt that.
[4210.25s -> 4211.21s]  I felt it in my bones.
[4212.09s -> 4216.90s]  Your winners are Helga and Luke Fisk.
[4217.54s -> 4219.43s]  I don't need to see anymore.
[4233.86s -> 4235.38s]  All right, so how do I go from here?
[4235.94s -> 4236.74s]  Now what?
[4236.74s -> 4240.49s]  I can't shake my drink anymore.
[4241.29s -> 4242.73s]  I don't like drinking on camera either.
[4243.37s -> 4249.59s]  I feel like I do weird shit with my mouth and I don't even see it.
[4250.79s -> 4252.31s]  All right, so where do I go?
[4253.03s -> 4255.61s]  Was that just a secret unlockable?
[4255.61s -> 4264.71s]  So this is just an unlockable.
[4265.35s -> 4271.60s]  Let's go.
[4273.26s -> 4277.61s]  These are nice backgrounds.
[4278.17s -> 4278.81s]  No, it is.
[4278.81s -> 4279.61s]  The art's really nice.
[4281.78s -> 4286.12s]  All right, so I gotta go down?
[4286.12s -> 4287.00s]  I can go down here.
[4291.22s -> 4292.90s]  This place is scary.
[4293.78s -> 4294.97s]  No, it's beautiful.
[4295.69s -> 4296.19s]  Look.
[4298.57s -> 4299.37s]  That's for the grouch.
[4303.32s -> 4310.12s]  How come the super frog is not in the talent show?
[4310.12s -> 4325.62s]  So anybody else think it's fucking weird that we just all of us just all go?
[4325.62s -> 4327.62s]  Yeah, that's normal for that to be down there.
[4328.87s -> 4329.11s]  Why?
[4329.11s -> 4332.17s]  Why we think that's there are fish.
[4332.17s -> 4335.29s]  There's stuff down in the deep sea that make their own light with their heads.
[4336.57s -> 4338.57s]  And they're weird monsters and shit.
[4338.57s -> 4339.77s]  We just like are like, yeah, that's fine.
[4340.49s -> 4343.21s]  There's like giant weird scary monsters down there.
[4343.21s -> 4346.22s]  Okay, that's whatever.
[4347.82s -> 4349.74s]  A huge amount of the sea is not even explored.
[4350.78s -> 4351.28s]  Yeah.
[4352.06s -> 4358.81s]  They're just minding their own business.
[4359.77s -> 4361.14s]  That's weird.
[4361.14s -> 4362.58s]  Isn't it weird, though, that those things exist?
[4363.54s -> 4369.45s]  What can I do for it?
[4369.45s -> 4370.49s]  It's a glowing ship.
[4370.49s -> 4371.37s]  A fishing pole.
[4371.37s -> 4374.33s]  The clue says go to the junkyard.
[4374.33s -> 4375.37s]  Go to the junkyard.
[4375.37s -> 4376.41s]  I need to get a bone.
[4378.34s -> 4380.42s]  Only 23% of the seas has been explored.
[4381.78s -> 4382.58s]  That's kind of crazy.
[4383.86s -> 4400.20s]  Okay, I gotta go back.
[4401.08s -> 4405.42s]  You're flipping off children.
[4409.43s -> 4411.03s]  But you know, my favorite comment is this one.
[4411.59s -> 4413.91s]  If you care so much, why don't you explore it yourself?
[4416.58s -> 4418.18s]  The junkyard is this way.
[4419.62s -> 4422.49s]  We only know about 5% of the universe.
[4423.53s -> 4429.96s]  Yeah, the fact that the universe itself is just so weird.
[4431.00s -> 4434.66s]  Okay, where do I go from here?
[4435.54s -> 4440.50s]  I need to go find a bone.
[4441.30s -> 4442.18s]  Where would get bones?
[4444.10s -> 4452.94s]  We should hurry to the junkyard to get the next bottle.
[4454.14s -> 4454.94s]  It was a skeleton.
[4454.94s -> 4455.18s]  Yep.
[4455.18s -> 4455.66s]  Where was it?
[4456.62s -> 4457.34s]  The whale bones.
[4457.34s -> 4457.82s]  Where were they?
[4462.42s -> 4462.90s]  I forgot.
[4471.18s -> 4473.34s]  Yeah, they're around here, right?
[4479.93s -> 4485.46s]  Oh, wait, I have a fishing pole now.
[4486.02s -> 4486.74s]  I can probably get that.
[4488.42s -> 4490.42s]  That won't help us get through the net.
[4490.42s -> 4491.14s]  What are you talking about?
[4491.86s -> 4492.58s]  No, thanks.
[4498.57s -> 4503.37s]  You need the suki duki duki polygizmo like I need another clock.
[4503.37s -> 4504.17s]  I need to get a clock?
[4504.17s -> 4506.33s]  And I do need another clock.
[4507.53s -> 4508.17s]  Find a clock.
[4508.17s -> 4510.17s]  The old whale bones are over here.
[4510.17s -> 4511.13s]  All right, let's go get the bone.
[4511.13s -> 4511.93s]  We're going to go to the dog.
[4511.93s -> 4513.29s]  We're going to get the thing over there.
[4513.29s -> 4513.85s]  We get a bone.
[4513.85s -> 4514.25s]  Here we go.
[4523.37s -> 4529.86s]  Do you guys think that there's another earth?
[4530.50s -> 4533.70s]  But the only difference is they just have one nostril.
[4533.70s -> 4534.90s]  And that's the only difference.
[4536.10s -> 4537.06s]  Everything else is identical.
[4549.74s -> 4550.30s]  Yeah.
[4550.30s -> 4553.86s]  Oh, it's a multiverse.
[4553.86s -> 4555.22s]  I don't believe in multiverse.
[4559.10s -> 4559.98s]  I don't believe in multiverse.
[4559.98s -> 4563.10s]  It pisses me off that like one of the germ has hit the fucking lottery and I didn't.
[4563.10s -> 4563.98s]  That makes me angry.
[4564.70s -> 4571.30s]  You know, like one of the Germans has huge muscles and it's like six feet tall.
[4572.10s -> 4572.98s]  That pisses me off.
[4572.98s -> 4574.18s]  I don't even want to believe in it.
[4574.18s -> 4575.22s]  I don't want to even know it's real.
[4575.78s -> 4576.42s]  That annoys me.
[4584.58s -> 4587.94s]  If I get like if I get there's like a crossover with like all the German multiverse
[4587.94s -> 4591.62s]  and there was like a tall like six to German, Jeremy, whatever.
[4592.74s -> 4596.39s]  And he's in a suit and shove them.
[4596.39s -> 4597.19s]  I'd be like, get out.
[4597.19s -> 4597.51s]  Shut up.
[4598.55s -> 4600.46s]  I'd be like, bring me another one.
[4601.61s -> 4605.94s]  Bring me another one.
[4605.94s -> 4612.04s]  I don't want this to be my crossover because I want to be the one in the
[4612.52s -> 4614.92s]  multiverse scenario where I'm the cool one.
[4614.92s -> 4616.52s]  Well, I'm the one that's the good one, right?
[4629.16s -> 4630.44s]  Bring one shorter.
[4631.32s -> 4633.90s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[4633.90s -> 4634.22s]  Go back.
[4641.51s -> 4641.75s]  Yeah.
[4641.75s -> 4648.71s]  Bring me bring me like weird cannibal germa and a germa that flunked every grade.
[4649.51s -> 4651.83s]  So I could just be, I'm the one that's the one they can tell.
[4651.83s -> 4653.67s]  I can be the one that dictates what we do.
[4654.39s -> 4655.48s]  Watch that.
[4655.48s -> 4656.60s]  No, I wouldn't want the cannibal.
[4656.60s -> 4657.80s]  I wouldn't want cannibal germa.
[4657.80s -> 4658.36s]  I would.
[4658.36s -> 4660.04s]  I don't think I'd want cannibal germa around.
[4661.56s -> 4664.12s]  Just bring me like caveman germa.
[4664.12s -> 4664.44s]  All right.
[4677.75s -> 4678.87s]  You're the caveman.
[4678.87s -> 4679.67s]  No, I'm not.
[4682.42s -> 4683.62s]  No, I'm not.
[4683.62s -> 4689.46s]  Bring me the dumb ones so I can be the smart one and I can be the one that the movie is
[4689.46s -> 4692.66s]  based around it because I don't want to be one of the other ones with the movies not
[4692.66s -> 4693.62s]  based on them.
[4693.62s -> 4694.42s]  You know, pissed off.
[4694.42s -> 4697.70s]  That would make me if Chad's six to germa with a suit.
[4697.70s -> 4701.86s]  It comes into the it's their movie and I'm the side other character.
[4702.42s -> 4703.30s]  No, fuck you.
[4704.26s -> 4704.74s]  Uh-uh.
[4705.46s -> 4706.18s]  That ain't happening.
[4706.74s -> 4713.24s]  You would be the villain.
[4714.12s -> 4715.00s]  No, I don't know.
[4715.00s -> 4715.72s]  I want the movie to be.
[4715.72s -> 4716.68s]  I wanted it.
[4716.68s -> 4719.32s]  Germa goes around the multiverse.
[4719.32s -> 4719.80s]  I don't want that.
[4719.80s -> 4721.00s]  I don't want to be the side character.
[4721.56s -> 4725.48s]  I don't want to have a portal open up behind me and I'm sitting at this desk and I'm the
[4725.48s -> 4727.80s]  joke that the Chad germa is his movie.
[4727.80s -> 4731.48s]  He's done like fucking 10 scenes already and he's like, oh, so game and honey.
[4731.48s -> 4733.64s]  Like then it's like, I'm the loser guy.
[4734.68s -> 4737.88s]  Like I look up my shoulder and he's in my universe and I'm a side character.
[4737.88s -> 4738.12s]  Nope.
[4745.19s -> 4745.51s]  I'm good.
[4745.51s -> 4746.95s]  I'm going to be ready for it.
[4746.95s -> 4748.55s]  I'm just sitting there.
[4748.55s -> 4749.75s]  Like I see the portal open.
[4749.75s -> 4751.75s]  I'm just sitting there like ready to fucking punch.
[4753.27s -> 4758.15s]  He puts his head through and a fist just hits him right in the square in the fucking face.
[4758.15s -> 4763.11s]  He's just like, he falls back in the hole and sucks around.
[4765.75s -> 4767.75s]  And then I obviously the cameras are still in the room.
[4767.75s -> 4770.23s]  So I look around and I go, it's my movie.
[4770.23s -> 4771.35s]  It's my movie.
[4771.35s -> 4772.23s]  Motherfuckers.
[4773.03s -> 4784.90s]  Where's the junkyard?
[4785.46s -> 4790.50s]  That's a villain.
[4790.50s -> 4795.82s]  Where's the junkyard?
[4795.82s -> 4796.78s]  I forget where the junkyard is.
[4796.78s -> 4797.18s]  I don't know.
[4801.78s -> 4803.70s]  I actually am lost.
[4803.70s -> 4806.10s]  Is it down?
[4807.06s -> 4808.02s]  No, it's not down.
[4808.02s -> 4808.82s]  I forget where it is.
[4810.26s -> 4812.50s]  I have not been paying any attention to this.
[4819.27s -> 4821.19s]  You imagine the scene after that though.
[4821.19s -> 4823.99s]  Imagine you go through the multiverse and just one's waiting for you.
[4823.99s -> 4830.95s]  Just fucking full on punches you square in the face and like smashes your nose in.
[4830.95s -> 4833.83s]  And you have to sit there with the other characters in the movie and be like,
[4833.83s -> 4834.63s]  why did that happen?
[4835.43s -> 4838.31s]  What was wrong with that one?
[4838.31s -> 4839.59s]  Why did he do that to me?
[4855.05s -> 4860.41s]  Yeah, I got to be careful because then I would be in the credits as Psycho Germa.
[4861.50s -> 4863.26s]  No, no, no, real Germa.
[4863.26s -> 4864.30s]  I'm real Germa.
[4864.30s -> 4866.78s]  Don't put me as like weirdo or Psycho Germa.
[4866.78s -> 4868.06s]  No, real Germa.
[4868.06s -> 4868.78s]  That's what I am.
[4871.27s -> 4875.11s]  And I would be 10 rows down on the credits.
[4875.91s -> 4877.11s]  And that makes me angry too.
[4879.99s -> 4881.54s]  No, not happening.
[4894.09s -> 4894.65s]  All right, I got it.
[4894.65s -> 4895.15s]  I got it.
[4900.07s -> 4906.06s]  And why do we think that the parallel multiverse universes are different versions of us?
[4906.06s -> 4912.14s]  No, there's not an infinite amount of versions of us.
[4914.39s -> 4916.95s]  If anything, we're going to jump around the multiverse and I'm going to be sitting
[4916.95s -> 4919.11s]  in the same goddamn spot with a different shirt on.
[4919.99s -> 4922.15s]  I'll have a green shirt on.
[4922.95s -> 4924.52s]  It'll be the same exact person.
[4941.64s -> 4943.00s]  You lost the treasure.
[4943.00s -> 4945.40s]  So now you got to see the squid father.
[4946.60s -> 4950.04s]  Please, boss, not the squid father.
[4951.00s -> 4953.08s]  Playing a different game, talking about a different topic.
[4961.75s -> 4962.95s]  Where's green shirt Germa?
[4962.95s -> 4963.43s]  He's better.
[4965.51s -> 4969.16s]  Hold on, let me open up the portal.
[4977.56s -> 4980.28s]  It's always like this, right?
[4981.80s -> 4986.26s]  They always put their fingers together and they do threading around a thread.
[4987.62s -> 4990.18s]  I've talked about this before on stream, but I'm sorry.
[4990.18s -> 4991.38s]  I don't understand casting.
[4992.94s -> 4993.50s]  I don't.
[4993.50s -> 4995.98s]  I know it's been like, yeah, old material.
[4995.98s -> 4996.30s]  I don't care.
[4996.30s -> 4997.02s]  There's new people here.
[4998.14s -> 5000.86s]  Why do people do fucking casting to cast spells?
[5001.42s -> 5001.98s]  Just go.
[5001.98s -> 5002.48s]  Go!
[5003.02s -> 5003.52s]  Done.
[5005.64s -> 5006.84s]  You don't have to go like this.
[5007.40s -> 5007.72s]  Just go.
[5007.72s -> 5008.36s]  Fireball, go!
[5011.37s -> 5012.17s]  That is a repeating joke.
[5012.17s -> 5012.57s]  That's fine.
[5022.62s -> 5027.18s]  Now we can trade Ray for his super duper duka buka poly gizmo.
[5028.14s -> 5030.06s]  Somebody just said, Germa, magic's not real.
[5038.33s -> 5040.97s]  So I'm talking about in creatively.
[5053.94s -> 5069.64s]  That's linear action that has no mysticism to it.
[5069.64s -> 5071.80s]  The action makes the move come to life.
[5071.80s -> 5072.44s]  Poo poo head.
[5084.76s -> 5094.34s]  I'm stuck in the car.
[5094.98s -> 5096.46s]  Oh, I got the clock.
[5096.46s -> 5096.86s]  Let's go.
[5100.15s -> 5102.52s]  You'd be the shittiest wizard.
[5102.52s -> 5105.78s]  No, I wouldn't because I would just go lightning.
[5105.86s -> 5108.58s]  And the person was like, while they were sitting there
[5108.58s -> 5111.14s]  doing all kinds of fucking moves for the camera,
[5111.78s -> 5114.10s]  they've already been struck by my lightning move
[5114.10s -> 5117.14s]  because I don't care with the bullshit around it.
[5117.14s -> 5118.02s]  I'm just going to lightning get him.
[5124.38s -> 5132.28s]  I like this one, but that would be evil.
[5132.28s -> 5133.40s]  No, that will be efficient.
[5141.37s -> 5141.61s]  All right.
[5141.61s -> 5142.49s]  Where's the clock guy?
[5143.61s -> 5149.56s]  Clock guy's somewhere over here, right?
[5151.70s -> 5156.70s]  Through here and then left, right?
[5158.14s -> 5162.58s]  Oh, that's just a gun.
[5163.30s -> 5183.48s]  Whatever.
[5187.29s -> 5188.81s]  Now open that up for the clock.
[5191.56s -> 5194.84s]  Now you get the super duper duper duper poly gizmo.
[5198.84s -> 5200.20s]  Nice doing business with you.
[5201.56s -> 5202.49s]  Okay.
[5202.49s -> 5202.89s]  Thank you.
[5224.39s -> 5225.43s]  Which one was it in this one?
[5226.92s -> 5228.20s]  Where is the pearl?
[5229.82s -> 5230.22s]  Bingo.
[5236.22s -> 5238.22s]  Then we bring the pearl to the king.
[5260.07s -> 5272.17s]  I'm leaving.
[5278.41s -> 5279.85s]  No, I don't need whale bones.
[5279.85s -> 5280.65s]  I don't need whale bones.
[5281.85s -> 5282.81s]  And they clap with their teeth.
[5282.81s -> 5283.37s]  That was weird.
[5284.01s -> 5295.24s]  They were like, this game's disturbing.
[5295.24s -> 5295.88s]  And no, it's not.
[5295.88s -> 5296.76s]  It's a game for kids.
[5302.20s -> 5303.48s]  I got to go find the castle again.
[5303.48s -> 5304.20s]  It's back with the crown.
[5304.92s -> 5305.64s]  Crown.
[5305.64s -> 5306.12s]  Go.
[5306.12s -> 5306.92s]  Get up.
[5306.92s -> 5312.09s]  Strawberry magic was disturbing.
[5312.09s -> 5312.57s]  Yes, it was.
[5313.53s -> 5314.97s]  This is not strawberry magic.
[5314.97s -> 5316.49s]  This is, I would say, pretty tame.
[5327.40s -> 5327.80s]  All right.
[5327.80s -> 5328.92s]  So now I go this way.
[5331.98s -> 5333.90s]  We go to the castle, bring the pearl.
[5333.98s -> 5335.66s]  I still have a fishing rod for whatever reason.
[5340.65s -> 5342.65s]  The king will see you now.
[5343.45s -> 5347.29s]  Strawberry magic was a masterpiece.
[5348.34s -> 5349.54s]  Yeah, we powered through that.
[5349.54s -> 5350.58s]  A lot of people didn't want to see it.
[5351.30s -> 5355.05s]  We did it.
[5355.05s -> 5357.77s]  All right, here you go.
[5357.77s -> 5358.33s]  What do I get?
[5358.33s -> 5359.45s]  It's a pearl.
[5359.45s -> 5360.49s]  What a pretty pearl.
[5360.49s -> 5363.45s]  I love all the citizens of my kingdom.
[5363.45s -> 5365.69s]  We love you too, King Crab.
[5366.49s -> 5372.79s]  It's a go to the three caves and enter.
[5372.79s -> 5375.48s]  I already did that.
[5376.44s -> 5378.74s]  I already did that.
[5384.46s -> 5385.26s]  I already did that.
[5387.02s -> 5387.98s]  I couldn't give the pearl.
[5387.98s -> 5393.02s]  In the next box.
[5393.02s -> 5394.22s]  This guy's a dictator.
[5400.66s -> 5403.70s]  All right, I got to go back to the big with the hole was.
[5413.13s -> 5414.17s]  Putt putt's better than this.
[5415.59s -> 5416.95s]  That's, I mean, be careful.
[5419.06s -> 5420.34s]  Oh, play pajama Sam.
[5420.34s -> 5420.74s]  Play putt.
[5420.74s -> 5422.34s]  They're all the same exact video game, guys.
[5422.34s -> 5423.46s]  They're the same game.
[5425.40s -> 5426.92s]  They're probably all maybe the same company.
[5426.92s -> 5429.48s]  We still need to find another bottle, Luther.
[5429.48s -> 5430.04s]  Right off.
[5434.33s -> 5435.13s]  All right, one on the right.
[5435.93s -> 5441.32s]  So what was the point of coming in here?
[5441.32s -> 5443.24s]  Oh, it's too dark.
[5443.24s -> 5445.26s]  That wasn't here before.
[5445.26s -> 5445.76s]  There.
[5446.46s -> 5448.33s]  I was already in here.
[5448.33s -> 5452.89s]  The clue says the treasure is hidden in the sunken ship.
[5453.53s -> 5456.60s]  Let's go get the kelp seeds at the old ship.
[5456.60s -> 5457.48s]  Oh, wait, this is it.
[5457.48s -> 5459.00s]  I know just where it is.
[5459.00s -> 5459.64s]  The old ship.
[5466.20s -> 5470.04s]  I put all my clues in bottles so I could find my way back to the treasure.
[5470.04s -> 5471.40s]  Evil squid.
[5471.40s -> 5474.52s]  I thought I put the voice bottle at the Nexus.
[5475.24s -> 5477.08s]  Let us in on that.
[5477.08s -> 5479.00s]  But, but, Squidfather.
[5479.64s -> 5481.96s]  Oh, was the voice bottle with the key?
[5483.16s -> 5484.60s]  Come on, Spongehead.
[5485.56s -> 5486.36s]  Think.
[5486.36s -> 5490.60s]  The Squidfather trusted us to hide the stolen kelp treasure for him.
[5493.88s -> 5495.96s]  But, but, but, but Squidfather.
[5495.96s -> 5497.96s]  Oh, no, he's spewing ink.
[5500.28s -> 5503.27s]  The treasure is.
[5503.91s -> 5509.19s]  Come on, Spongehead.
[5511.67s -> 5512.79s]  Doesn't a lot look like me.
[5512.79s -> 5513.59s]  Somebody said it's you.
[5522.86s -> 5527.74s]  That old shipwreck has held so many treasures over so many years.
[5527.74s -> 5528.14s]  Okay.
[5528.14s -> 5530.54s]  We're looking for Grandma Grouper's treasure.
[5531.82s -> 5533.10s]  Good luck, mates.
[5533.10s -> 5533.90s]  Do you know where it is?
[5536.25s -> 5538.25s]  It's a fishing port.
[5538.25s -> 5543.13s]  That old ship sailed through hurricanes, typhoons, thunder, and lightning.
[5543.77s -> 5546.81s]  But it went down in the great culp of Ort 7.
[5547.93s -> 5555.82s]  Hey, Freddy.
[5555.82s -> 5557.74s]  What do you think is behind that window?
[5557.74s -> 5558.62s]  I don't know.
[5558.62s -> 5559.40s]  What the heck?
[5559.40s -> 5560.04s]  What's in there?
[5560.04s -> 5562.18s]  Look, Looper.
[5562.18s -> 5564.63s]  Grouper's kelp treasure.
[5564.63s -> 5565.69s]  It's in there.
[5565.69s -> 5567.27s]  Yes.
[5567.27s -> 5569.83s]  Now I'm going to be rich, rich, rich.
[5569.83s -> 5573.75s]  Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is for everyone to see.
[5573.75s -> 5574.47s]  No, no, no.
[5574.47s -> 5578.79s]  And besides, the window is closed and it's much too heavy to open.
[5578.87s -> 5579.83s]  It's inside of there.
[5579.83s -> 5583.99s]  It's going to be like a thank you card.
[5583.99s -> 5585.75s]  Let's go find a crank handle.
[5587.88s -> 5588.68s]  Yeah, right.
[5588.68s -> 5595.21s]  It's going to be like one coupon for a fun block party.
[5596.25s -> 5597.21s]  There's not going to be money in there.
[5597.93s -> 5599.38s]  There's not going to be money in there.
[5599.38s -> 5601.22s]  It's a fishing port.
[5601.22s -> 5602.18s]  It's a pearl.
[5605.69s -> 5606.49s]  Look, Looper.
[5606.49s -> 5610.90s]  Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is in there.
[5610.90s -> 5611.70s]  I don't want to hit this again.
[5612.26s -> 5613.06s]  Yes.
[5613.06s -> 5615.14s]  Now I'm going to be rich, rich, rich.
[5615.14s -> 5620.04s]  Looper, Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is for everyone to share.
[5620.04s -> 5624.20s]  And besides, the window is closed and it's much too heavy to open.
[5624.20s -> 5625.00s]  Yeah, it's going to be empty.
[5625.00s -> 5629.08s]  If we can find a handle for the crank, we could crank open the window and swim inside.
[5629.08s -> 5630.68s]  And the octopus is going to come over.
[5630.68s -> 5631.48s]  Let's go find a crank handle.
[5631.48s -> 5632.68s]  What does this mean?
[5632.68s -> 5633.40s]  This is impossible.
[5634.04s -> 5634.68s]  What's in here?
[5634.68s -> 5635.56s]  There's nothing in here.
[5636.20s -> 5638.23s]  It's going to be like exactly.
[5649.02s -> 5651.27s]  It's going to be kelp.
[5651.27s -> 5652.47s]  It's going to be just seeds or something.
[5653.43s -> 5664.30s]  Oh, that's just cute.
[5664.30s -> 5665.02s]  That's cute.
[5665.02s -> 5665.74s]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[5665.74s -> 5669.66s]  If you don't like find what just happened to be like an enjoyable thing.
[5670.38s -> 5671.26s]  What are you talking about?
[5673.18s -> 5673.66s]  Like this.
[5675.26s -> 5677.58s]  Look at how just how cute this is right there.
[5680.58s -> 5680.90s]  Right.
[5680.90s -> 5681.14s]  Hi.
[5681.14s -> 5681.62s]  Like, come on.
[5682.34s -> 5683.69s]  Come on.
[5688.41s -> 5705.50s]  I don't even really.
[5705.50s -> 5707.18s]  I don't think farts are even funny.
[5707.18s -> 5707.82s]  They're not.
[5707.82s -> 5710.70s]  It's just sometimes the cartoon sound effect farts are.
[5712.30s -> 5713.93s]  It's a multiverse.
[5719.59s -> 5728.12s]  Do you?
[5728.12s -> 5732.81s]  Oh, it's the doctor strange would be sitting there going like this and go.
[5732.81s -> 5733.85s]  Oh, it's me.
[5733.85s -> 5736.33s]  You're dealing with the master of the defense of the dark arts or whatever it is.
[5736.33s -> 5739.46s]  And he makes the circle.
[5740.34s -> 5745.13s]  Magic isn't real.
[5745.69s -> 5773.16s]  I know it's not coming handy.
[5773.16s -> 5774.20s]  Oh, it's a crutch.
[5774.84s -> 5775.16s]  Okay.
[5778.10s -> 5781.70s]  My eyes are looking over here and just bear with me here.
[5781.70s -> 5785.06s]  So I'm looking right here and my eyes right here.
[5785.14s -> 5786.58s]  See, this is a turkey leg.
[5786.58s -> 5788.34s]  This is a bone and meat on it.
[5788.34s -> 5789.30s]  And I was like, oh, turkey leg.
[5789.30s -> 5789.78s]  But it's not.
[5809.90s -> 5810.54s]  Keep going down.
[5811.10s -> 5811.50s]  There's more.
[5819.10s -> 5825.82s]  It's opening your little ones.
[5825.82s -> 5829.66s]  I'm Phineas McFinn, the finest sailor on the seven seas.
[5834.26s -> 5835.62s]  It's a beautiful.
[5838.98s -> 5839.54s]  Do you want a button?
[5839.54s -> 5842.58s]  Super duper duka buka poly gizmo can open the shrimp.
[5848.44s -> 5855.48s]  There's just one word that says it all when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm good or bad.
[5858.44s -> 5861.32s]  To starboard from stem to stern.
[5867.30s -> 5869.70s]  Definitely one of the multiversal characters of that character.
[5872.10s -> 5873.06s]  I can't hear you.
[5874.54s -> 5875.74s]  One more time.
[5876.70s -> 5877.50s]  I was a pirate.
[5877.50s -> 5878.46s]  Very good.
[5878.46s -> 5879.66s]  Excellent.
[5879.66s -> 5884.71s]  In fact, the handle is broken.
[5886.78s -> 5887.74s]  Arrgh too hard.
[5887.74s -> 5889.90s]  If you could find old Phineas another musical instrument,
[5889.90s -> 5893.02s]  I would gladly trade you this useless crank handle.
[5894.54s -> 5895.90s]  Okay, I need a new handle.
[5900.73s -> 5916.28s]  Okay, you're not listening.
[5916.28s -> 5917.56s]  He said he needs a handle.
[5917.56s -> 5920.22s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5920.22s -> 5921.26s]  Can I go down through here?
[5924.20s -> 5925.00s]  Down, down.
[5926.84s -> 5927.40s]  All right.
[5927.40s -> 5927.96s]  Up.
[5927.96s -> 5928.78s]  Let's go up.
[5928.78s -> 5929.26s]  No, no, no.
[5929.26s -> 5930.06s]  Down, down.
[5930.06s -> 5930.62s]  And then up.
[5933.32s -> 5934.04s]  Yeah, what the hell?
[5934.04s -> 5935.00s]  Why is this taking me though?
[5935.00s -> 5935.32s]  Hold on.
[5937.72s -> 5940.79s]  So this is on a different way.
[5943.75s -> 5944.71s]  This just goes back up.
[5946.84s -> 5947.16s]  Okay.
[5948.14s -> 5949.58s]  Well, I have a crutch now.
[5949.58s -> 5951.10s]  I don't know what to do with it, but we'll be back.
[5952.06s -> 5954.44s]  Stop pretending to be bad.
[5955.08s -> 5961.32s]  I haven't played this game ever.
[5961.32s -> 5962.44s]  Even if it's a five-year-old's.
[5963.40s -> 5963.96s]  I don't know.
[5967.08s -> 5973.86s]  Okay, so I need his crank.
[5974.74s -> 5979.64s]  What can I do with the crutch?
[5979.64s -> 5980.04s]  You?
[5980.04s -> 5981.00s]  Oh, do you want it?
[5981.00s -> 5981.24s]  Here.
[5990.62s -> 5992.46s]  This motherfucker looks like one of the goldfish.
[5994.86s -> 5996.14s]  He looks like a goldfish snack.
[5997.72s -> 5998.92s]  How come they didn't make him that big?
[6000.02s -> 6001.78s]  He looks like an extra big goldfish snack.
[6014.36s -> 6015.48s]  They should have made him like that.
[6018.94s -> 6020.38s]  The snack that's miles back.
[6020.38s -> 6020.94s]  Goldfish.
[6021.74s -> 6024.70s]  Minus two the fuck out of that.
[6024.70s -> 6025.26s]  I dare you.
[6026.14s -> 6026.94s]  I dare you.
[6030.79s -> 6033.11s]  Here's another musical instrument for you.
[6033.11s -> 6033.59s]  Great.
[6035.48s -> 6036.28s]  Here.
[6036.28s -> 6037.40s]  Take this crank handle.
[6038.60s -> 6039.64s]  Thanks, Phineas.
[6041.08s -> 6042.14s]  Arrgh!
[6042.14s -> 6044.22s]  There's just one word that says it all.
[6044.22s -> 6044.78s]  Arrgh!
[6045.34s -> 6046.70s]  Arrgh when I'm happy.
[6046.70s -> 6047.98s]  Arrgh when I'm sad.
[6047.98s -> 6049.74s]  Arrgh when I'm good or bad.
[6049.74s -> 6050.78s]  Arrgh!
[6050.78s -> 6052.06s]  Arrgh to port.
[6052.06s -> 6053.34s]  Arrgh to starboard.
[6053.34s -> 6055.42s]  Arrgh from stem to stern.
[6055.42s -> 6056.55s]  Arrgh!
[6056.55s -> 6058.07s]  Arrgh you swatty.
[6058.07s -> 6059.11s]  Arrgh!
[6059.11s -> 6062.17s]  The yo ho ho hum hum my chum.
[6062.17s -> 6063.50s]  Arrgh!
[6063.50s -> 6064.86s]  What's that you say?
[6064.86s -> 6065.82s]  Arrgh!
[6065.82s -> 6067.18s]  I can't hear ya.
[6067.18s -> 6068.25s]  Arrgh!
[6068.25s -> 6070.09s]  One more time.
[6070.09s -> 6070.89s]  Arrgh!
[6070.89s -> 6072.30s]  Very good.
[6072.30s -> 6073.10s]  Excellent.
[6073.66s -> 6074.30s]  In fact.
[6074.94s -> 6075.34s]  Arrgh!
[6076.89s -> 6078.09s]  Heart piss me the fuck off.
[6081.61s -> 6083.05s]  And starring Sam Miller.
[6086.63s -> 6090.66s]  You can eat it or wear it.
[6104.06s -> 6104.70s]  No fox?
[6104.70s -> 6105.10s]  Arrgh!
[6105.10s -> 6106.22s]  I don't even want to look at it.
[6107.10s -> 6108.98s]  All right.
[6108.98s -> 6110.34s]  So we're about to get the treasure, guys.
[6110.34s -> 6111.30s]  You guys ready?
[6111.30s -> 6111.54s]  Guys.
[6113.96s -> 6114.84s]  Let's see what the treasure is.
[6121.74s -> 6122.46s]  Here we go.
[6122.46s -> 6123.10s]  It's time.
[6126.18s -> 6128.90s]  Hmm.
[6128.90s -> 6130.04s]  Okay.
[6138.42s -> 6139.22s]  They open it all of a sudden.
[6139.22s -> 6139.62s]  It just goes.
[6141.62s -> 6142.34s]  Jiminy!
[6142.34s -> 6142.74s]  Freddy!
[6142.74s -> 6142.90s]  Run!
[6143.70s -> 6144.02s]  I'm sorry.
[6144.02s -> 6144.58s]  That was probably really loud.
[6144.58s -> 6146.74s]  Told you we'd find the treasure, boss.
[6146.74s -> 6147.38s]  That was really loud.
[6147.38s -> 6148.02s]  I'm really sorry.
[6148.02s -> 6148.90s]  Okay, you two.
[6148.90s -> 6150.02s]  Hand over the treasure.
[6151.66s -> 6151.90s]  No.
[6153.91s -> 6154.39s]  I'm sorry.
[6154.39s -> 6155.67s]  I forget the fucking thing.
[6155.67s -> 6156.39s]  It sucks.
[6156.39s -> 6159.91s]  Well, we gotta take the treasure to the squid father.
[6160.47s -> 6162.31s]  So we can grow some kelp.
[6163.03s -> 6166.15s]  If we share the seeds, we can all grow kelp.
[6166.15s -> 6168.31s]  Share the kelp seeds?
[6168.31s -> 6169.43s]  Gee, boss.
[6170.15s -> 6174.50s]  The kelp seeds are for everyone.
[6174.50s -> 6174.82s]  Wait.
[6175.38s -> 6177.10s]  I got an idea.
[6177.74s -> 6179.74s]  We can share the kelp seeds.
[6180.70s -> 6182.70s]  Great idea, boss.
[6183.34s -> 6183.66s]  Yes.
[6185.34s -> 6185.90s]  Yay!
[6185.90s -> 6187.06s]  What?
[6187.06s -> 6188.10s]  That's all it took?
[6188.10s -> 6191.78s]  Let's go tell the squid father we're all going to share.
[6192.74s -> 6196.95s]  All it took was just being like,
[6196.95s -> 6198.15s]  hey, we should probably just share these.
[6198.79s -> 6199.19s]  Aye!
[6201.11s -> 6206.18s]  You found the kelp.
[6206.18s -> 6209.51s]  Oh, it is just kelp.
[6212.15s -> 6222.07s]  You're really messing up this dev's engine here.
[6222.07s -> 6223.77s]  You're just messing with the grass tool.
[6225.05s -> 6227.05s]  Somebody has to come and clean this shit up.
[6227.05s -> 6229.77s]  Don't let your son on the computer when you're working on the game.
[6231.86s -> 6235.22s]  Freddy, you found the treasure.
[6237.22s -> 6239.43s]  You can't minus two and say L-U-L.
[6239.43s -> 6239.99s]  That doesn't work.
[6239.99s -> 6243.03s]  I saved your treasure, Grandma Gooper.
[6243.03s -> 6246.95s]  Well, okay, Freddy helped a little, but I figured it out.
[6246.95s -> 6248.58s]  I'm very brave.
[6249.22s -> 6251.14s]  Oh, I'm sure you were, loser.
[6251.86s -> 6254.66s]  Now, can you both help me plant the seeds?
[6255.86s -> 6256.98s]  In my backyard?
[6258.82s -> 6260.18s]  Of course, they'll be for everyone,
[6260.18s -> 6263.94s]  but I will be the one to dictate who gets what I, you know, who gets it.
[6263.94s -> 6265.86s]  But plant them all in my backyard.
[6266.42s -> 6268.58s]  Of course, I'll spread it out evenly.
[6269.30s -> 6271.78s]  I want a good bird.
[6271.78s -> 6275.34s]  You speak me such.
[6279.93s -> 6281.98s]  I'm so proud of you both.
[6282.70s -> 6289.21s]  Why don't we go inside so you can tell me all about your adventure?
[6289.21s -> 6290.17s]  Somebody extra seeds.
[6291.21s -> 6296.41s]  Stop, go.
[6296.41s -> 6296.91s]  What?
[6303.78s -> 6304.90s]  That's my favorite character.
[6306.18s -> 6307.22s]  That's my favorite character.
[6307.78s -> 6321.83s]  Oh, can't you just see this being Smash Brothers stage music?
[6324.47s -> 6327.48s]  Three, one, go.
[6328.60s -> 6335.54s]  So what is go?
[6335.54s -> 6337.93s]  Here we go again.
[6337.93s -> 6338.89s]  I don't want to go again.
[6341.94s -> 6343.22s]  No, I don't want to go again.
[6345.94s -> 6354.25s]  Thanks for getting the flowers, Sam.
[6355.37s -> 6356.41s]  Sure thing, Freddy.
[6357.61s -> 6360.52s]  They're wonderful.
[6360.52s -> 6362.04s]  Gotta go, Sam.
[6362.04s -> 6362.84s]  Bye, Freddy.
[6363.66s -> 6365.34s]  All right, I need the truending.
[6366.22s -> 6367.10s]  There is no truending.
[6367.10s -> 6367.98s]  All right, so that was fun.
[6367.98s -> 6371.27s]  That was Freddy Fish and the magic of the kelp seeds.
[6372.15s -> 6380.46s]  On to Freddy Fish 2, which I've been told,
[6381.58s -> 6384.06s]  just skip Freddy Fish 1, go to Freddy Fish 2.
[6384.22s -> 6385.50s]  Hi, Fnappy Turtle.
[6385.50s -> 6386.22s]  Hi, Freddy.
[6387.58s -> 6391.02s]  Here, Fnappy, you look like you need some cheering up.
[6391.02s -> 6391.52s]  For me?
[6393.66s -> 6395.10s]  Please don't, no, please.
[6398.57s -> 6400.49s]  This is Freddy Fish Day.
[6401.05s -> 6404.49s]  Can we please play Freddy Fish 4 next?
[6405.21s -> 6406.09s]  No, it's Freddy Fish 2.
[6406.09s -> 6407.77s]  Everyone said Freddy Fish 2 is the one you play.
[6408.58s -> 6411.06s]  We did Freddy Fish 1 to get to Freddy Fish 2.
[6414.20s -> 6416.28s]  Well, I guess it's time for you to decide.
[6417.16s -> 6418.20s]  After Freddy Fish 2,
[6420.33s -> 6423.21s]  final impressions of Freddy Fish kelp seed mystery,
[6423.21s -> 6424.17s]  five equals best.
[6427.58s -> 6428.38s]  Okay, you know what?
[6428.38s -> 6432.78s]  This honestly looks like every Amazon review I've ever seen.
[6435.06s -> 6436.02s]  Even if it's five stars,
[6436.02s -> 6437.70s]  there's like a shitload of five stars
[6437.70s -> 6446.62s]  and then a bunch of one stars.
[6446.62s -> 6449.19s]  How do you reliably give something a three?
[6449.19s -> 6450.39s]  I don't think you can.
[6450.39s -> 6451.11s]  You can't do it, right?
[6451.75s -> 6452.87s]  If you're going to leave a review,
[6452.87s -> 6454.55s]  you either loved it or you hated it.
[6455.11s -> 6457.67s]  I don't know if you make a review on Amazon
[6457.67s -> 6459.99s]  for something that you just kind of generally thought was okay.
[6459.99s -> 6460.55s]  You don't really.
[6460.55s -> 6461.91s]  You either do it if you love it or hate it.
[6462.55s -> 6470.34s]  All right, so people like that.
[6470.34s -> 6471.38s]  So we're going to do Freddy Fish 2.
[6471.38s -> 6472.26s]  Let's go.
[6472.26s -> 6472.74s]  I'm ready.
[6473.38s -> 6474.73s]  Maybe I should go pee first.
[6474.73s -> 6475.29s]  Should I go pee?
[6477.40s -> 6479.48s]  This is the case of the haunted schoolhouse.
[6480.12s -> 6484.14s]  Okay, let's give it a go.
[6491.91s -> 6492.23s]  Okay.
[6496.23s -> 6496.73s]  Jesus.
[6497.59s -> 6498.94s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6498.94s -> 6499.42s]  I'm not ready.
[6500.14s -> 6502.02s]  I'm not ready.
[6502.02s -> 6502.66s]  I'm not ready.
[6502.66s -> 6504.50s]  Good morning, Mr. Krabby.
[6504.50s -> 6507.26s]  What the fuck?
[6507.26s -> 6513.02s]  Where the hell is it?
[6513.02s -> 6516.78s]  What the fuck is it?
[6516.86s -> 6517.26s]  Come on.
[6519.02s -> 6520.55s]  Okay, we're good.
[6520.55s -> 6522.07s]  Sorry I'm late, Freddy.
[6522.07s -> 6526.63s]  I just had to find my Codfish Commando action figure for show and tell.
[6526.63s -> 6527.91s]  That's okay, Lother.
[6527.91s -> 6531.50s]  But we better get going before we're late.
[6531.50s -> 6532.14s]  All right, let's go.
[6534.17s -> 6535.37s]  This art is worse.
[6536.01s -> 6536.65s]  No, it's not.
[6537.85s -> 6540.97s]  All right, let's see.
[6541.61s -> 6542.57s]  Are the clickables as good?
[6542.57s -> 6543.85s]  People said this is the one to play.
[6543.85s -> 6544.97s]  The first one's a bad game.
[6547.14s -> 6547.78s]  Already bored.
[6547.78s -> 6549.30s]  The clickables are not very good so far.
[6549.30s -> 6552.42s]  I was all right.
[6552.42s -> 6554.10s]  I'd give that a three on Amazon.
[6559.02s -> 6559.34s]  Okay.
[6560.06s -> 6564.82s]  That's a five.
[6565.94s -> 6570.84s]  Four.
[6571.72s -> 6572.28s]  That's a five.
[6573.32s -> 6573.56s]  Four.
[6575.48s -> 6575.72s]  Five.
[6576.76s -> 6577.00s]  Three.
[6578.04s -> 6578.84s]  Let's go.
[6578.84s -> 6585.45s]  Hit the heart.
[6585.45s -> 6588.01s]  Freddy, did you bring everything you need for school?
[6588.01s -> 6589.77s]  Of course I did, Lother.
[6589.77s -> 6592.89s]  In fact, I'm ready for a great day.
[6592.89s -> 6594.60s]  And a few are too.
[6597.08s -> 6620.31s]  Three, two.
[6647.26s -> 6647.98s]  Oh, look at that.
[6649.59s -> 6651.75s]  I'll race you to school, Freddy.
[6651.75s -> 6653.19s]  So I thought the school is haunted?
[6653.19s -> 6654.31s]  Is that what I've been told?
[6655.72s -> 6658.20s]  Where are all the guppies?
[6658.20s -> 6659.64s]  We're hiding.
[6659.64s -> 6662.52s]  The guppies say the school is haunted by a ghost
[6662.52s -> 6665.24s]  and that the ghost is stealing their toy.
[6665.24s -> 6665.56s]  Okay.
[6665.56s -> 6667.88s]  I saw the ghost, Mrs. Croaker.
[6667.88s -> 6672.52s]  It stupefied me with fear and then it stole my toy.
[6673.24s -> 6674.04s]  Boo.
[6674.04s -> 6681.29s]  Toy.
[6681.85s -> 6682.09s]  Boo.
[6682.09s -> 6688.42s]  No such thing as ghosts.
[6689.14s -> 6696.23s]  Luther and I will find luck, friends.
[6696.23s -> 6701.78s]  Boo.
[6701.78s -> 6702.66s]  I don't want to do all that.
[6706.78s -> 6710.39s]  Uh, Mrs. Guppy, did somebody?
[6712.65s -> 6714.17s]  Dave is in the cabinet eating paste.
[6714.81s -> 6716.17s]  We probably shouldn't have him do that.
[6722.58s -> 6723.14s]  Oh no.
[6725.05s -> 6726.01s]  What is he doing?
[6731.03s -> 6732.71s]  We need to get him out of there.
[6737.90s -> 6738.70s]  It's a multiverse.
[6739.90s -> 6741.50s]  The guppies all want.
[6741.50s -> 6754.07s]  They sure did add songs in this one.
[6754.63s -> 6756.39s]  A lot of songs.
[6783.34s -> 6784.54s]  Ten years grow.
[6784.54s -> 6788.39s]  What happened?
[6788.39s -> 6791.83s]  If we had to get haunted, why couldn't we get a friendly ghost?
[6792.76s -> 6796.28s]  I'm really glad Mrs. Croaker decided to stay with us.
[6796.28s -> 6797.32s]  She's great.
[6798.20s -> 6800.68s]  With all this spooky stuff going on,
[6800.68s -> 6803.56s]  maybe Mrs. Croaker will forget to give us homework.
[6804.52s -> 6807.32s]  Okay, bye.
[6810.36s -> 6815.05s]  Does that technically mean make the earth flat?
[6815.93s -> 6819.34s]  Is that right?
[6819.34s -> 6820.14s]  Technically, right?
[6824.34s -> 6826.34s]  If the earth was a cube, would it be flat?
[6827.06s -> 6829.54s]  I mean, technically, like some of the earth would be flat, right?
[6830.66s -> 6831.54s]  The earth was a cube.
[6835.54s -> 6836.74s]  It's fine crap.
[6843.42s -> 6847.50s]  I'm just, I'm just saying if the earth was a cube, not a globe,
[6847.50s -> 6849.58s]  it would be a flat plane.
[6850.54s -> 6855.83s]  It would be three dimensional.
[6856.63s -> 6863.54s]  Cube does not mean flat, but what?
[6864.58s -> 6865.62s]  It would be three dimensions.
[6866.34s -> 6868.28s]  It would be three dimensionally flat.
[6871.99s -> 6879.74s]  Guys, no, I do not.
[6879.74s -> 6882.30s]  Okay, excuse me.
[6882.30s -> 6885.34s]  We need to get this really cleared up here immediately.
[6886.30s -> 6887.83s]  I'm just making a thing.
[6887.83s -> 6891.11s]  I'm making a joke as to it turned it into flat sides.
[6891.11s -> 6894.71s]  Okay, it was merely a jokey reference.
[6895.43s -> 6901.21s]  Okay, I can't take the glue.
[6908.71s -> 6914.81s]  Whoa, get out of there.
[6914.81s -> 6926.47s]  Oh, it's just scrubbing bubbles.
[6927.27s -> 6929.67s]  I love that guy's voice, by the way, the scrubbing,
[6929.67s -> 6934.31s]  the scrubbing bubbles cleaning extra fast with their scrubbing bubble technology.
[6934.31s -> 6935.03s]  I love that guy.
[6935.03s -> 6935.99s]  I love that voice so much.
[6937.43s -> 6941.38s]  You guys know who I'm talking about.
[6941.38s -> 6943.38s]  You know exactly the commercial, you know exactly the voice.
[6947.19s -> 6959.75s]  There's a lot more clickable than this one.
[6960.15s -> 6971.24s]  I don't watch Reddit TV.
[6973.54s -> 6978.18s]  Man, I don't think Reddit was even a website when this commercial was airing.
[6979.82s -> 6981.42s]  Vote Freddy for class prez.
[6982.30s -> 6984.34s]  That's cute.
[6984.34s -> 6985.54s]  I like that.
[6985.54s -> 6987.22s]  Go Marlins.
[6993.05s -> 6994.86s]  I just kind of broke everything.
[7001.02s -> 7006.33s]  Let's go.
[7019.35s -> 7021.43s]  Better look out.
[7021.43s -> 7023.91s]  I'll be back to get that toy.
[7027.19s -> 7031.40s]  Freddy, he almost got away with my Cush Commando action figure.
[7031.40s -> 7034.52s]  Why does that ghost have to steal kids' toys?
[7035.32s -> 7038.10s]  Look, it's part of the ghost.
[7040.57s -> 7043.77s]  Luther, I don't think that ghost wears sheep.
[7043.77s -> 7047.37s]  Whoever is scaring the guppies is just wearing a ghost costume.
[7052.58s -> 7060.26s]  I'd let's build a trap of almost everything we need.
[7061.69s -> 7062.81s]  This is not going to work, Fred.
[7063.37s -> 7067.05s]  This is a list of all the things we need to build our trap.
[7067.05s -> 7072.01s]  We'll just need to get a trident, a wheel for the baby buggy,
[7072.01s -> 7078.49s]  a mock stock middle box whopper popper, a cork, and a rope for our trap to be complete.
[7078.49s -> 7079.05s]  I don't.
[7079.05s -> 7080.33s]  I can't sneeze on stream.
[7080.33s -> 7081.21s]  I don't know what's going on.
[7084.70s -> 7086.14s]  Every time I have to, it just doesn't happen.
[7086.78s -> 7091.72s]  I start thinking about it a lot and then I try to mute the microphone and it stops the sneeze.
[7094.38s -> 7095.10s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[7105.16s -> 7111.00s]  Look at all this stuff.
[7112.68s -> 7128.79s]  Are you messing up my joke?
[7130.15s -> 7135.37s]  This dude's stoned.
[7137.40s -> 7140.68s]  This chandelier is going to trap the bad guy.
[7140.68s -> 7142.60s]  All right, so we got a trap in the chandelier.
[7142.60s -> 7144.84s]  I can find a way to catch that toy napper.
[7144.84s -> 7146.76s]  Be at him.
[7146.76s -> 7149.35s]  Let me at him.
[7149.35s -> 7153.13s]  Okay, so we got to drop that.
[7153.85s -> 7158.31s]  We need to get a few tools, drop that shit on him.
[7161.48s -> 7162.36s]  What are the scissors for?
[7169.38s -> 7177.75s]  Oh, there's a frog from the first one.
[7179.98s -> 7180.30s]  Say it.
[7181.26s -> 7184.09s]  How do you look like this?
[7184.09s -> 7184.49s]  I don't know.
[7187.00s -> 7188.44s]  People ask that question all the time.
[7188.44s -> 7189.08s]  I don't.
[7189.08s -> 7189.64s]  What do you want to say?
[7189.64s -> 7192.36s]  Good thing we didn't pass up that purple sea urchin.
[7192.36s -> 7193.48s]  It might come in handy.
[7193.48s -> 7195.86s]  What do you want to say?
[7195.86s -> 7196.66s]  Oh, peanuts.
[7196.66s -> 7199.30s]  Say it's a book about untying knots.
[7199.30s -> 7201.22s]  Okay.
[7201.22s -> 7202.82s]  We may need it later.
[7203.54s -> 7210.94s]  That was fun.
[7218.87s -> 7219.75s]  Okay, I got a book.
[7220.31s -> 7221.19s]  What should I move the painting?
[7222.39s -> 7223.35s]  I'm going to move the painting.
[7225.96s -> 7227.40s]  The clock has blood all over it.
[7233.13s -> 7234.49s]  I wish I could have just done that.
[7238.58s -> 7239.14s]  Let's go down.
[7242.33s -> 7248.15s]  Hey, it's another purple sea urchin.
[7248.15s -> 7249.99s]  So I'm guessing I need four or five of these again.
[7253.06s -> 7255.27s]  Hey, open that cork.
[7255.27s -> 7256.55s]  Did you get this cork?
[7256.55s -> 7258.47s]  Two real hard...
[7258.47s -> 7265.27s]  It was air.
[7265.27s -> 7265.59s]  Air?
[7267.03s -> 7267.67s]  That's water.
[7267.67s -> 7271.67s]  Just pulling out the cork is definitely not going to work.
[7271.67s -> 7272.87s]  Well, we need a pipe, right?
[7272.87s -> 7274.31s]  Because look, this connects here.
[7276.76s -> 7279.40s]  No, we don't connect the pipe.
[7283.72s -> 7290.17s]  I like that.
[7290.17s -> 7293.06s]  Oh, a wrench.
[7293.06s -> 7294.10s]  We found a wrench.
[7295.38s -> 7296.50s]  This is a saw room.
[7302.12s -> 7303.56s]  Okay, wrench, scissors.
[7306.04s -> 7307.24s]  How to untie a knot.
[7310.30s -> 7311.26s]  Hmm.
[7311.26s -> 7312.28s]  All right, let's go back up.
[7316.50s -> 7318.26s]  Do you know, and I figured this out recently,
[7318.82s -> 7321.06s]  I had it kind of warped and wrong in my brain.
[7321.78s -> 7323.78s]  Remember I told you guys that I bet...
[7323.78s -> 7326.17s]  I don't know, whatever I bet that time.
[7326.73s -> 7330.41s]  But I said they definitely say the word gas in the saw movie
[7331.05s -> 7332.41s]  like a thousand times or something, right?
[7332.41s -> 7334.49s]  I thought, oh, the room's going to fill with gas.
[7334.49s -> 7337.61s]  No, what it actually was, and this is where I got screwed up,
[7337.61s -> 7341.53s]  is that there's a poison coursing through your veins.
[7341.53s -> 7343.29s]  There's a deadly nerve poison.
[7344.01s -> 7345.05s]  They all had poison.
[7345.69s -> 7348.57s]  Slow acting poison was what it was, not gas.
[7348.57s -> 7349.21s]  I had it wrong.
[7350.89s -> 7353.29s]  It's a slow acting poison in your blood.
[7353.77s -> 7357.19s]  So that's what I was thinking of.
[7366.74s -> 7369.14s]  I mean, people, when I said that for the first time,
[7369.86s -> 7375.30s]  some of you fucking movie transcript Andes went to every script.
[7375.86s -> 7378.42s]  You found them all and you control F'd gas
[7378.42s -> 7380.82s]  and told me that it said three times in the whole,
[7380.82s -> 7383.14s]  the 10 movie franchise.
[7395.32s -> 7397.08s]  Okay, so I'm going to go out
[7398.20s -> 7399.64s]  because I have scissors and I have a wrench.
[7401.53s -> 7402.65s]  What should I do with this stuff?
[7403.93s -> 7410.95s]  Wrench here?
[7410.95s -> 7411.75s]  It's a wrench.
[7411.75s -> 7411.99s]  No.
[7411.99s -> 7412.71s]  It's a wrench.
[7414.49s -> 7415.61s]  Control F Andes.
[7417.78s -> 7419.14s]  So what do I do with the, with this?
[7419.14s -> 7419.54s]  It's a wrench.
[7419.54s -> 7420.50s]  What do I do with this stuff?
[7420.50s -> 7421.46s]  It's a book.
[7421.46s -> 7424.66s]  These are the things we need to find to trap the ghost.
[7424.66s -> 7425.70s]  This is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
[7425.70s -> 7429.70s]  We'll still need to get a trident, a wheel for the baby buggy,
[7429.70s -> 7432.42s]  a mock stock middle box whopper bopper,
[7432.42s -> 7436.02s]  a cork, and a rope to make our trap.
[7436.02s -> 7436.82s]  Yep.
[7436.82s -> 7438.30s]  Oh, yes it is.
[7439.18s -> 7439.42s]  All right.
[7439.42s -> 7440.38s]  The cork is down there.
[7440.38s -> 7441.10s]  The rope, I don't know.
[7441.10s -> 7442.06s]  The wheel, I don't know.
[7442.06s -> 7445.66s]  The mock stock middle box whopper bopper,
[7446.38s -> 7447.10s]  whatever that is.
[7447.10s -> 7447.82s]  And then a trident.
[7448.38s -> 7448.54s]  Okay.
[7448.54s -> 7449.50s]  So what do I take with this?
[7453.03s -> 7458.07s]  Hey, get him.
[7462.97s -> 7463.69s]  Let's go out here.
[7467.43s -> 7467.67s]  All right.
[7467.67s -> 7468.39s]  Is this a school?
[7469.91s -> 7470.79s]  I'm going to piss my pants.
[7470.79s -> 7471.83s]  I'll be right back.
[7471.83s -> 7757.18s]  At least the term of your mic is on.
[7757.18s -> 7758.94s]  We can hear you freestyling.
[7760.06s -> 7761.90s]  I'm just sitting here freestyling.
[7762.86s -> 7771.16s]  Okay.
[7771.16s -> 7771.96s]  Let's turn this off.
[7772.92s -> 7775.38s]  Back to Freddy Fish.
[7776.10s -> 7783.34s]  Why would I be sitting here doing that?
[7783.34s -> 7787.53s]  We just heard angry breathing.
[7788.09s -> 7800.39s]  Are you going to play Pajama Sam?
[7801.11s -> 7801.91s]  I don't know.
[7801.91s -> 7805.19s]  People request these games all the time as a joke.
[7805.19s -> 7808.23s]  And then when I actually play them, I go, oh, that was okay.
[7808.23s -> 7810.63s]  I don't really want to play 15 more of these.
[7813.26s -> 7813.58s]  They're cool.
[7813.58s -> 7814.06s]  They're fine.
[7814.70s -> 7822.73s]  But I don't want to play 20 Pajama Sam, Putt-Putt, and Freddy Fish games.
[7823.29s -> 7827.24s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7832.04s -> 7837.72s]  How come?
[7837.72s -> 7837.96s]  Okay.
[7837.96s -> 7838.44s]  Back to it.
[7839.51s -> 7840.47s]  You can see the wrench, right?
[7844.82s -> 7845.30s]  That's fine.
[7845.30s -> 7845.54s]  Yeah.
[7847.50s -> 7848.22s]  Okay.
[7848.22s -> 7849.10s]  So what was I doing?
[7849.99s -> 7851.03s]  I was going to...
[7851.83s -> 7852.55s]  Let's go this way.
[7858.87s -> 7861.11s]  50 community subs from Freddy Dread.
[7865.61s -> 7867.45s]  Somebody named Big C gave 52.
[7867.45s -> 7868.49s]  You guys gave a lot of subs.
[7868.49s -> 7869.05s]  Holy shit.
[7875.90s -> 7880.15s]  Who is this kid?
[7891.03s -> 7897.45s]  A science magazine and glasses to read it with.
[7898.97s -> 7900.57s]  Life is good.
[7901.93s -> 7904.81s]  I hope this is not a scenario where he loses his glasses, right?
[7905.69s -> 7906.73s]  I'm not going to hit him with what?
[7911.13s -> 7911.37s]  All right.
[7911.37s -> 7913.61s]  So what are you looking for?
[7913.61s -> 7914.25s]  You looking for something?
[7919.67s -> 7919.91s]  All right.
[7919.91s -> 7920.95s]  Let's go right.
[7924.09s -> 7924.49s]  There it is.
[7924.49s -> 7924.97s]  There's a pipe.
[7926.81s -> 7927.05s]  Yep.
[7928.25s -> 7929.90s]  Let's go pick it up.
[7947.14s -> 7948.10s]  How are we going to get you out of there?
[7955.70s -> 7957.14s]  I'm going to have to put something on my head.
[7964.81s -> 7965.69s]  That looks painful.
[7966.65s -> 7967.05s]  All right.
[7967.05s -> 7968.25s]  Well, you've screwed that up.
[7970.50s -> 7973.88s]  We're going to get some product to get you out of there or something.
[7973.88s -> 7974.20s]  Whatever.
[7988.92s -> 7989.64s]  We're going to come back.
[7989.64s -> 7990.92s]  Is he going to be alive?
[7990.92s -> 7991.64s]  This is fucked up.
[7993.16s -> 7993.80s]  There's a trident.
[8002.07s -> 8002.63s]  Bad end.
[8004.92s -> 8006.04s]  You're leaving him to die.
[8011.72s -> 8013.05s]  All right.
[8013.05s -> 8014.09s]  So how do we get the trident?
[8018.39s -> 8018.79s]  Isn't it?
[8020.62s -> 8021.82s]  It's not that looser.
[8022.46s -> 8026.10s]  The trident is being blocked by.
[8026.10s -> 8027.14s]  Do I have to get rid of the ceiling?
[8027.78s -> 8029.72s]  It's a wrench.
[8029.72s -> 8030.76s]  These are my.
[8034.50s -> 8034.82s]  Great.
[8036.82s -> 8038.42s]  I mean, this thing is already done.
[8039.51s -> 8041.03s]  This is a finished puzzle.
[8041.59s -> 8045.19s]  The kid just needs to click three times to move it.
[8045.99s -> 8047.03s]  You know what I mean?
[8047.03s -> 8048.07s]  This thing's finished.
[8049.27s -> 8050.95s]  I don't have to go too hard with this.
[8054.39s -> 8063.66s]  This shit's done.
[8063.66s -> 8064.30s]  I just need to.
[8084.33s -> 8085.85s]  Why is this a huge one?
[8089.77s -> 8090.73s]  Why is it so huge?
[8093.96s -> 8095.56s]  No, it was finished.
[8095.56s -> 8096.68s]  They finished it for me.
[8096.68s -> 8101.08s]  Why does that?
[8101.08s -> 8122.46s]  Okay.
[8129.11s -> 8129.91s]  Why is it a double?
[8130.39s -> 8131.03s]  I would be fine.
[8131.03s -> 8135.19s]  It wasn't a double.
[8135.59s -> 8147.80s]  You're over complicating it.
[8147.80s -> 8148.44s]  No, I'm not.
[8148.44s -> 8149.64s]  It's a fucking double.
[8149.64s -> 8150.60s]  Why is there a double?
[8151.24s -> 8152.04s]  Why is there a double?
[8159.21s -> 8159.93s]  I don't do that.
[8159.93s -> 8161.21s]  I hate these fucking things.
[8161.21s -> 8163.05s]  I just I every time one of these comes up,
[8163.61s -> 8165.45s]  I exit the game or I skip it.
[8165.45s -> 8166.33s]  I don't I hate it.
[8167.05s -> 8169.96s]  I just hate these things.
[8169.96s -> 8171.16s]  I hate these things.
[8174.90s -> 8175.06s]  All right.
[8175.06s -> 8176.98s]  Well, this obviously is in the wrong spot.
[8177.78s -> 8185.38s]  I hate these things.
[8185.38s -> 8186.50s]  I thought it was already done.
[8186.50s -> 8187.30s]  I thought it was already done.
[8187.30s -> 8188.74s]  I overcomplicated that for myself.
[8198.86s -> 8202.90s]  We need to get four more things to make our trap.
[8202.90s -> 8203.06s]  All right.
[8203.06s -> 8203.70s]  We got the Trident.
[8204.34s -> 8205.06s]  Anything else here?
[8211.19s -> 8212.15s]  What's going on?
[8212.15s -> 8214.31s]  Oh, I thought that video was playing in the background.
[8216.23s -> 8226.25s]  Oh, let's go.
[8227.86s -> 8233.11s]  What's this?
[8234.71s -> 8235.67s]  Secret passage.
[8235.67s -> 8236.15s]  That's not.
[8238.79s -> 8240.39s]  Stop showing me other games to play.
[8240.39s -> 8241.19s]  I don't want to play that one.
[8254.90s -> 8258.26s]  I guarantee you there is videos on YouTube that are
[8259.06s -> 8260.50s]  Freddy Fish episode two.
[8262.18s -> 8265.62s]  The search for the haunted school colon brackets.
[8266.82s -> 8270.34s]  No commentary clicking on every clickable slowly.
[8271.62s -> 8272.10s]  Guaranteed.
[8273.06s -> 8275.22s]  And the video is just silent and it's just.
[8290.30s -> 8291.34s]  That probably do pretty well.
[8292.30s -> 8299.78s]  That would probably do pretty well.
[8305.03s -> 8307.27s]  Cool.
[8307.27s -> 8311.91s]  All right.
[8311.91s -> 8313.11s]  So is there anything I can do here?
[8313.91s -> 8314.71s]  I can't do anything.
[8327.32s -> 8328.20s]  I'm just going to leave.
[8329.66s -> 8330.38s]  Save the guy.
[8331.59s -> 8332.07s]  What guy?
[8335.51s -> 8336.15s]  Save what guy?
[8343.90s -> 8344.78s]  Oh, that's right.
[8345.74s -> 8346.30s]  I don't know how.
[8354.76s -> 8355.72s]  He's not moving.
[8355.72s -> 8356.52s]  He's not moving.
[8363.34s -> 8373.93s]  What's going on?
[8378.89s -> 8379.77s]  That was apparently wrong.
[8379.77s -> 8380.25s]  Do it again.
[8420.63s -> 8421.67s]  That was so weird.
[8423.05s -> 8426.17s]  Or shoot.
[8426.17s -> 8428.33s]  Anything else here?
[8431.13s -> 8437.05s]  Was there nothing down there?
[8437.85s -> 8443.94s]  All right.
[8443.94s -> 8445.22s]  Well, there's a submarine over this way.
[8446.18s -> 8452.60s]  A lot of tools still.
[8452.60s -> 8453.40s]  I'm ready.
[8453.40s -> 8453.88s]  I'm good.
[8453.88s -> 8454.20s]  I'm good.
[8464.66s -> 8465.38s]  That was huge.
[8468.57s -> 8475.34s]  This is this would be fun when I was a kid.
[8475.34s -> 8475.98s]  This would be fun.
[8487.21s -> 8488.17s]  Did you play this kid?
[8488.17s -> 8490.57s]  I played putt-putt, I think, for 10 minutes.
[8499.42s -> 8511.32s]  Is this an iPad?
[8513.80s -> 8515.16s]  Wait, there's something shining down there.
[8521.88s -> 8522.84s]  Oh, it's this guy again.
[8538.65s -> 8539.13s]  It's terrible.
[8542.26s -> 8543.78s]  I'll give you a thousand dollars and never do that again.
[8575.35s -> 8575.83s]  Do it again.
[8575.83s -> 8576.31s]  Do it again.
[8576.31s -> 8576.79s]  Do it again.
[8576.79s -> 8579.91s]  The trident we're going to use to build our trap.
[8579.91s -> 8581.03s]  I've been chewing trident lately.
[8581.03s -> 8582.23s]  It didn't make my teeth a little bit better.
[8589.54s -> 8590.34s]  There's nothing here.
[8594.18s -> 8600.10s]  Oh, that's a reference to when I was younger.
[8600.10s -> 8601.54s]  And I said that at the dentist.
[8601.54s -> 8602.82s]  Do you guys even watch my stream?
[8603.86s -> 8607.16s]  That's the worst joke ever.
[8608.94s -> 8611.58s]  That is a direct reference to me at the dentist chair
[8611.58s -> 8613.02s]  when I was like fucking 12.
[8613.90s -> 8615.74s]  Remember I told you when I went to the dentist
[8615.74s -> 8618.62s]  and I told the dentist that I was chewing trident?
[8619.42s -> 8620.70s]  I made it up.
[8620.70s -> 8621.98s]  Do you guys even watch this stream?
[8624.66s -> 8632.95s]  God, I gotta go down.
[8632.95s -> 8646.42s]  Ahoy, Captain Schnitzel.
[8646.42s -> 8647.78s]  How's the submarine?
[8647.78s -> 8652.74s]  Oh, not going nowhere fast, but that's okay.
[8652.74s -> 8656.90s]  It gives me time to sing my Z diddys.
[8656.90s -> 8662.86s]  I had a girlfriend, a 2,000 pounder that's slim for a whale,
[8662.86s -> 8664.22s]  but she was a flounder.
[8664.22s -> 8666.62s]  Hey, nanny, nanny, and a hot cha cha.
[8666.62s -> 8670.60s]  Hey, nanny, nanny, and a hot cha cha.
[8670.60s -> 8671.56s]  You know what I just noticed?
[8672.66s -> 8676.82s]  How come every horror movie, all the horror movie antagonists,
[8677.14s -> 8680.10s]  there's always a scene every time in every one of the movies.
[8680.10s -> 8683.06s]  Every scary monster or scary person movie,
[8683.06s -> 8683.78s]  they always do this.
[8683.78s -> 8685.70s]  They go, there's a scene where it's them
[8685.70s -> 8688.02s]  and the main character is looking at them and they go,
[8689.70s -> 8694.49s]  they go like, they do the head tilt thing.
[8695.05s -> 8695.29s]  Why?
[8696.33s -> 8702.23s]  It's like, why do they keep doing that?
[8702.23s -> 8703.59s]  They do it in every fucking single movie.
[8707.19s -> 8709.91s]  May we have that rope for our trap, Captain Schnitzel?
[8709.91s -> 8710.39s]  You'll see it.
[8710.39s -> 8713.67s]  Yeah, you can take it if you can untie it.
[8713.67s -> 8715.99s]  I'm going to, I just ruined every horror movie you're going to watch now.
[8715.99s -> 8716.95s]  Have you ever been able to untie it?
[8716.95s -> 8720.95s]  When they show the bad guy or the monster or the thing,
[8720.95s -> 8722.31s]  the thing, that's the scary thing.
[8723.27s -> 8725.99s]  It is going to, it does the dog head tilt.
[8726.87s -> 8729.51s]  You're going to see it now because you're going to be looking for it
[8729.51s -> 8730.47s]  and you're going to say, what the fuck?
[8730.47s -> 8731.59s]  You just ruined the whole movie for me.
[8735.98s -> 8742.97s]  Jeepers, we're not having.
[8742.97s -> 8743.45s]  You're wrong.
[8744.57s -> 8745.21s]  Just watch it.
[8745.21s -> 8747.61s]  We need to pull on the end of the rope to untie it.
[8747.85s -> 8748.81s]  Really slow.
[8748.81s -> 8749.93s]  And then it's like a chase scene.
[8751.35s -> 8753.99s]  We need to pull on the ends of the rope to untie it.
[8754.63s -> 8755.11s]  What are you talking about?
[8755.11s -> 8755.51s]  I just did it.
[8756.47s -> 8757.11s]  Keep going.
[8758.63s -> 8763.50s]  Keep going like this and the rope will be untied in no time.
[8765.82s -> 8769.56s]  Looks like this way.
[8769.56s -> 8770.04s]  Wait, what?
[8770.04s -> 8770.68s]  What's going on?
[8772.28s -> 8772.60s]  What?
[8772.60s -> 8773.08s]  What?
[8773.08s -> 8774.28s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8774.28s -> 8775.08s]  Hold on.
[8775.08s -> 8777.80s]  This is where we are now.
[8778.76s -> 8780.20s]  Now keep going.
[8780.20s -> 8780.76s]  Good work.
[8781.24s -> 8781.74s]  Yay.
[8784.09s -> 8786.49s]  Now we have the rope we need for our trap.
[8786.49s -> 8789.45s]  We need three more things to make our ghost trap.
[8791.13s -> 8793.13s]  That is literally only in Halloween.
[8793.13s -> 8794.25s]  No, it is not.
[8795.21s -> 8797.37s]  Look, I don't have to be right right now.
[8797.37s -> 8800.01s]  I can be right like two months from now when you figure it out.
[8800.01s -> 8801.13s]  I don't have to be right right now.
[8805.78s -> 8807.54s]  Every time Michael Myers tilts his head.
[8812.25s -> 8813.29s]  It's other movies too.
[8813.29s -> 8814.73s]  It's not just Michael Myers.
[8829.19s -> 8831.91s]  Everybody does it because it's a reference to Michael Myers.
[8832.15s -> 8836.73s]  Whatever it is, I keep seeing it.
[8837.45s -> 8840.60s]  All right, so we're good.
[8840.60s -> 8841.48s]  We're good.
[8841.48s -> 8847.03s]  I made a stop motion animation and I had my monster do that.
[8847.03s -> 8848.31s]  Laughing my ass off.
[8848.31s -> 8849.19s]  That's what I'm saying.
[8853.16s -> 8855.32s]  My favorite thing about this stream is you can leave for half an hour
[8855.32s -> 8857.48s]  and Gerber will still be talking about the same thing when you get back.
[8858.52s -> 8859.88s]  It's been five minutes.
[8859.88s -> 8861.32s]  Look, I'm the captain.
[8873.22s -> 8874.34s]  Are you okay?
[8874.34s -> 8875.54s]  I'll be okay.
[8875.54s -> 8877.62s]  Just feeling a little buggy right now.
[8878.58s -> 8881.38s]  Luther, I think you hit on something.
[8881.38s -> 8884.42s]  Yes, unfortunately, it was something very hard.
[8885.14s -> 8889.30s]  No, that wheel will be perfect for a trap.
[8889.30s -> 8889.86s]  I need a wheel.
[8892.66s -> 8898.02s]  Luther, we'll need to find a way to loosen this bolt so we can get the wheel.
[8898.90s -> 8900.34s]  Chat, I got a wrench.
[8900.34s -> 8901.30s]  Chat, I got a wrench.
[8904.63s -> 8905.67s]  Try this, Luther.
[8906.23s -> 8907.11s]  The game is too rough.
[8908.82s -> 8909.38s]  It has to be.
[8910.02s -> 8911.14s]  So you can hear the voice acting.
[8911.14s -> 8912.58s]  We did it.
[8912.58s -> 8924.81s]  Is that oil?
[8925.69s -> 8926.55s]  Pick that up.
[8927.59s -> 8928.71s]  This is going to get the pipe.
[8928.71s -> 8930.23s]  It looks like we struck oil.
[8931.11s -> 8934.23s]  Non-toxic biodegradable oil to be exact.
[8936.73s -> 8938.09s]  So how do you like it?
[8938.09s -> 8939.85s]  I call it the wet look.
[8939.85s -> 8941.53s]  Just toss the oil over here.
[8942.81s -> 8949.56s]  We can go save the turtle.
[8953.16s -> 8957.61s]  Very cool.
[8959.69s -> 8967.03s]  Nice.
[8968.39s -> 8968.71s]  Nice.
[8971.34s -> 8971.98s]  Nice, dude.
[8972.94s -> 8973.98s]  All right, let's go save the turtle.
[8986.58s -> 8988.34s]  I almost have all the things.
[8989.06s -> 8995.13s]  I'm going to get the pipe and then I got the rope.
[8995.13s -> 8996.09s]  What do I do with the scissors?
[8997.29s -> 9004.52s]  Imitate the sound effects.
[9004.52s -> 9007.82s]  I'll try for the next two minutes.
[9007.82s -> 9008.78s]  I'll try to imitate the sounds.
[9022.87s -> 9050.94s]  That's enough.
[9050.94s -> 9057.05s]  Yeah, a drop of oil might do the trick.
[9057.13s -> 9057.77s]  Someone just wrote.
[9058.41s -> 9058.89s]  That's enough.
[9060.73s -> 9061.53s]  They were right.
[9062.25s -> 9062.89s]  I felt the same way.
[9062.89s -> 9063.53s]  Oh my gosh!
[9063.53s -> 9068.36s]  No head to clean up.
[9068.36s -> 9069.48s]  It's not in here.
[9070.34s -> 9071.46s]  Poor Tucker.
[9071.46s -> 9073.30s]  I hope he gets a head in life
[9073.30s -> 9075.06s]  because he sure doesn't have one now.
[9076.71s -> 9077.91s]  Sure I do.
[9077.91s -> 9079.91s]  It was just stuck in my shell.
[9081.43s -> 9084.15s]  Are we glad you're okay.
[9084.15s -> 9085.43s]  Thanks to you kids.
[9087.54s -> 9090.34s]  There's nothing like the smell of a brand new shell.
[9091.30s -> 9092.34s]  I'm glad we could help you.
[9093.14s -> 9095.38s]  Back to that room with the cork in it.
[9095.94s -> 9096.74s]  Put the pipe there.
[9096.74s -> 9097.38s]  Get the cork.
[9098.18s -> 9099.38s]  And then we need one more item.
[9100.42s -> 9101.86s]  I don't know what to do with this guy.
[9102.90s -> 9104.55s]  Something about science.
[9104.55s -> 9107.43s]  Last week I invented a pocket protector.
[9107.43s -> 9109.35s]  This week I'm inventing the pocket.
[9116.30s -> 9119.66s]  Okay, so now I got to go into the school and it's down.
[9121.18s -> 9121.66s]  There he is.
[9123.34s -> 9124.70s]  Oh wait, he puts something up.
[9124.70s -> 9125.10s]  What's up?
[9131.11s -> 9135.21s]  Cool.
[9135.21s -> 9136.57s]  All right, through here.
[9139.85s -> 9141.26s]  Pipe, cork.
[9143.38s -> 9144.58s]  Then I'll have all the items, right?
[9148.89s -> 9149.93s]  I think I'll have all the items.
[9158.39s -> 9161.99s]  This pipe would fit great where that cork is.
[9161.99s -> 9163.19s]  I don't know Freddy.
[9163.19s -> 9164.60s]  It'll end up small.
[9166.38s -> 9166.94s]  It'll fit.
[9166.94s -> 9167.34s]  Just do it.
[9176.78s -> 9177.74s]  Okay, so now what do I need?
[9177.74s -> 9181.50s]  There's only one more thing we need to build our pizza list
[9181.50s -> 9183.66s]  that shows what we need to build our trap.
[9183.66s -> 9190.30s]  I need the Mockstock Mibblebock Whopper Bopper to make our trap.
[9190.30s -> 9192.28s]  Where am I supposed to get that?
[9193.08s -> 9200.41s]  A Mockstock Wibblebopper.
[9200.41s -> 9201.29s]  Oh, these guys again.
[9204.65s -> 9206.33s]  Yes, Squidfather.
[9206.33s -> 9209.29s]  We know you never had a toy in your whole life, but...
[9209.29s -> 9214.01s]  But we can't get you any until the kids are out of the classroom.
[9214.65s -> 9223.96s]  Well, the kids haven't left yet because of that Freddy fish.
[9227.16s -> 9228.68s]  Yes, Squidfather.
[9228.68s -> 9230.04s]  No more excuses.
[9231.00s -> 9232.92s]  We'll do what we gotta do.
[9236.47s -> 9237.35s]  I thought that was an egg.
[9237.35s -> 9238.71s]  It was a cat.
[9238.71s -> 9240.55s]  We gotta get rid of those kids.
[9241.43s -> 9243.11s]  I thought it was a fried egg.
[9243.11s -> 9243.91s]  All right, we got...
[9244.87s -> 9247.78s]  We gotta go this way.
[9255.24s -> 9257.30s]  Out and then find...
[9257.30s -> 9258.18s]  Where is this other thing?
[9261.13s -> 9263.02s]  Oh, where would you be?
[9263.02s -> 9265.66s]  Okay, you look for a rope that's holding something up.
[9265.66s -> 9266.86s]  A trident in a statue.
[9266.86s -> 9269.66s]  A wheel that's on a car or on the...
[9269.66s -> 9270.46s]  Where am I supposed to...
[9270.46s -> 9275.19s]  A Mockstock Mibblebopper.
[9275.19s -> 9276.39s]  But that's not a real thing.
[9276.39s -> 9277.51s]  Where would I find this?
[9277.51s -> 9278.79s]  Where were this even supposed to be?
[9278.79s -> 9284.01s]  I'm gonna get close.
[9299.85s -> 9301.61s]  Get the nerd to invent it.
[9303.61s -> 9305.13s]  That's probably what you have to do.
[9307.02s -> 9308.62s]  Get the nerd to invent it.
[9309.58s -> 9312.58s]  It's definitely this way.
[9320.36s -> 9321.08s]  Whoa, that was cool.
[9326.18s -> 9334.26s]  Where is it?
[9335.30s -> 9348.34s]  Oh, I have to jump like bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
[9348.34s -> 9361.11s]  All right, here and then to here and then to...
[9364.52s -> 9366.26s]  Where am I trying to go?
[9373.54s -> 9377.10s]  I didn't know what I was trying to do.
[9377.10s -> 9379.18s]  I didn't know it was supposed to go that way.
[9382.49s -> 9386.30s]  Dude, where the hell is this thing?
[9386.30s -> 9387.46s]  What'd you get?
[9395.50s -> 9407.94s]  There was a skateboard in there.
[9407.94s -> 9409.30s]  We're going so far away.
[9410.58s -> 9414.70s]  Holy shit.
[9421.29s -> 9422.17s]  Zoomer nursery.
[9428.17s -> 9429.05s]  Not this shit again.
[9443.02s -> 9443.34s]  Shoot.
[9448.04s -> 9450.28s]  All right, this is where I gotta get the thing, right?
[9450.28s -> 9451.00s]  Should I do it again?
[9451.56s -> 9452.84s]  All right, I'll do it two more times.
[9453.24s -> 9453.64s]  That's it.
[9454.28s -> 9462.50s]  I can't reach.
[9462.50s -> 9470.49s]  Where's my mouse?
[9473.91s -> 9474.55s]  All right, last one.
[9476.23s -> 9476.87s]  No, I'm done.
[9477.83s -> 9479.56s]  That was kind of fun.
[9479.56s -> 9481.58s]  So where's this thing?
[9485.21s -> 9487.45s]  Don't you feel like I went a really long way to not get this thing?
[9491.10s -> 9496.23s]  This way?
[9498.17s -> 9499.05s]  That was kind of fun.
[9502.17s -> 9502.89s]  All right, I'm gonna go in.
[9507.19s -> 9508.39s]  You should play Club Penguin.
[9509.88s -> 9511.40s]  Oh, all right, let's go.
[9511.40s -> 9513.32s]  Hi, Mr. Triple Finn.
[9513.32s -> 9514.44s]  Hey, kids.
[9514.44s -> 9516.76s]  Why doesn't an octopus jog?
[9516.76s -> 9517.32s]  Why?
[9517.32s -> 9520.36s]  It has to tie four pairs of shoes.
[9521.64s -> 9525.74s]  So just get four.
[9526.54s -> 9528.10s]  Just get eight shoes.
[9528.82s -> 9530.84s]  That's not even a joke.
[9531.56s -> 9533.80s]  Just get eight sneakers and you can run.
[9534.52s -> 9535.08s]  I don't get it.
[9537.53s -> 9538.89s]  Sitting on my porch.
[9539.85s -> 9541.13s]  Nothing could be finer.
[9541.85s -> 9545.45s]  Chef may be eating at Eddie's or you can eat diner.
[9546.33s -> 9549.45s]  The food there is healthy and it tastes good to me.
[9550.49s -> 9554.65s]  You know, I only wish that it could be free.
[9558.10s -> 9558.74s]  That was cute.
[9559.46s -> 9560.58s]  So what do you need?
[9569.48s -> 9570.36s]  We have three.
[9570.36s -> 9571.72s]  We have it's a list.
[9572.68s -> 9574.76s]  What do fish use for money?
[9574.76s -> 9576.36s]  I think I know this one.
[9576.36s -> 9577.80s]  Sand dollars.
[9577.80s -> 9578.84s]  I thought so.
[9582.07s -> 9582.63s]  These?
[9582.71s -> 9587.45s]  How guppy who'd hoop and holla.
[9588.41s -> 9592.23s]  He had a fine young seahorse by the name of Sand dollar.
[9592.95s -> 9596.71s]  He'd ride into town with his 10 gallon hat,
[9597.59s -> 9599.11s]  but nobody knew his name.
[9599.99s -> 9629.34s]  As a matter of fact, I'm having a good time.
[9629.34s -> 9630.22s]  I'm just kind of chilling.
[9630.22s -> 9631.18s]  This is fun.
[9631.18s -> 9631.90s]  I'm just chilling.
[9635.51s -> 9643.45s]  I'm just chilling.
[9646.46s -> 9648.46s]  The stream activated my acid reflux.
[9649.58s -> 9655.56s]  I would just eat.
[9656.36s -> 9657.88s]  Hi, kids.
[9657.88s -> 9659.48s]  What can I do you for?
[9659.48s -> 9660.44s]  Hey, Ray.
[9660.44s -> 9661.24s]  How's business?
[9662.60s -> 9667.72s]  You probably heard that I am now a collector of fine new and used trophies
[9668.44s -> 9671.56s]  and I'm trading one of the specialty item.
[9673.32s -> 9675.08s]  A mock stock middle box.
[9675.08s -> 9675.56s]  I gotta move on.
[9675.56s -> 9676.68s]  I gotta play another game.
[9676.68s -> 9679.16s]  A very hot item, I might add.
[9679.88s -> 9681.16s]  I was like about to yawn.
[9681.96s -> 9682.36s]  It was like.
[9689.66s -> 9695.34s]  This is way under my cost, but since you're such swell looking kids,
[9695.34s -> 9699.74s]  I'll let you have it for one slightly used trophy.
[9700.46s -> 9700.94s]  Trophy?
[9701.98s -> 9704.81s]  I think we could probably find a used trophy.
[9704.81s -> 9705.69s]  Where do I get a trophy?
[9707.03s -> 9707.99s]  I don't have a trophy.
[9710.74s -> 9711.22s]  Fuck you.
[9713.30s -> 9713.80s]  Casino.
[9715.30s -> 9716.10s]  That's not a casino.
[9716.10s -> 9716.98s]  It's a movie theater.
[9716.98s -> 9717.94s]  I think it is.
[9720.10s -> 9721.14s]  Should we go to the movies?
[9721.14s -> 9721.64s]  Movies.
[9727.42s -> 9730.22s]  Flashing lights or a casino in my brain.
[9730.22s -> 9731.58s]  All right, let's go to the movies.
[9731.58s -> 9732.08s]  All right, let's see.
[9733.83s -> 9735.35s]  Yes, I'm actually now.
[9735.35s -> 9736.23s]  I'm excited again.
[9736.87s -> 9738.76s]  We get to watch movies.
[9738.76s -> 9741.08s]  I love going to the theater.
[9750.38s -> 9752.06s]  Freddie, do I like the next movie?
[9752.94s -> 9753.44s]  Yeah.
[9758.92s -> 9760.60s]  All right, Codzilla.
[9762.20s -> 9763.16s]  Action figure guy.
[9763.88s -> 9764.38s]  Roma.
[9765.00s -> 9765.88s]  Worm doodles.
[9766.60s -> 9767.10s]  Sheriff.
[9770.92s -> 9771.48s]  Goblin.
[9771.48s -> 9772.12s]  Dracula.
[9772.92s -> 9774.12s]  Fish with thing on his nose.
[9774.68s -> 9775.32s]  Bug movie.
[9777.31s -> 9777.81s]  Let's go.
[9789.42s -> 9791.74s]  It was awful.
[9791.74s -> 9797.04s]  All right, how about lightning?
[9798.52s -> 9800.20s]  How about Gatorade, the movie?
[9801.85s -> 9803.37s]  How have they not done that yet, by the way?
[9818.11s -> 9818.99s]  That one was bad too.
[9820.03s -> 9832.67s]  Chumlet.
[9841.93s -> 9847.96s]  That's two thumbs up.
[9848.84s -> 9849.96s]  That's two thumbs up for me.
[9869.53s -> 9870.17s]  Oh my god.
[9872.24s -> 9873.60s]  All right, that was funny.
[9873.60s -> 9875.60s]  All right, yeah, that one gets one thumbs up.
[9876.24s -> 9890.86s]  This is another, this is a game.
[9891.74s -> 9899.65s]  It's Canadian.
[9906.14s -> 9920.28s]  All right, these are just TikToks.
[9949.08s -> 9955.56s]  That was the whole movie.
[9957.08s -> 9959.16s]  That was the, that was the entire movie.
[9959.96s -> 9965.85s]  This is, okay, this is a scary movie.
[9965.85s -> 9967.05s]  I wonder if the character goes like this.
[9970.11s -> 9971.63s]  Curse of the sardine.
[9971.63s -> 9972.13s]  Let's go.
[9981.50s -> 9997.88s]  Okay, that was the title.
[9998.68s -> 10002.14s]  Coming to a theater.
[10002.14s -> 10002.62s]  Oh, it's a trailer.
[10002.62s -> 10003.50s]  It's a trailer.
[10006.99s -> 10020.96s]  Godfish commando.
[10021.60s -> 10036.44s]  That was dumb.
[10038.03s -> 10039.82s]  All right, worm doodles.
[10045.82s -> 10048.46s]  Worm doodle in all your favorite flavors.
[10048.46s -> 10053.74s]  Original, chocolate, sea cucumber, lemon, orange, red.
[10053.74s -> 10054.62s]  Is this Justin Roiland?
[10057.37s -> 10058.65s]  Because you gotta have them.
[10063.82s -> 10065.02s]  You gotta have them.
[10066.62s -> 10067.42s]  Worm doodle.
[10069.10s -> 10070.22s]  I like this one.
[10070.22s -> 10072.86s]  Worm doodle in all your favorite flavors.
[10072.86s -> 10077.82s]  Original, chocolate, sea cucumber, lemon, orange, red.
[10077.82s -> 10080.38s]  This reminds me, this reminds me of Justin Roiland.
[10088.00s -> 10088.50s]  Red.
[10089.28s -> 10097.93s]  Sheriff Gill.
[10100.96s -> 10102.08s]  All right, this is a town.
[10102.72s -> 10106.11s]  I don't know, I couldn't even read that.
[10117.02s -> 10121.90s]  I like the sound effects.
[10121.90s -> 10138.51s]  Luther, if we spend too long in here, we'll never trap that ghost.
[10140.49s -> 10143.61s]  Freddy, do you think they'll play the movie with that fish I like?
[10143.61s -> 10144.73s]  I don't know, Luther.
[10149.58s -> 10150.94s]  That person just ate a whole turkey.
[10157.04s -> 10162.92s]  Holy shit.
[10165.48s -> 10167.16s]  How much food does this guy have?
[10201.64s -> 10203.00s]  I have to get out of here.
[10203.00s -> 10203.88s]  I have to leave now.
[10206.60s -> 10207.72s]  I just couldn't get out.
[10208.68s -> 10209.88s]  All right, what about the pulley?
[10209.88s -> 10210.76s]  Pulley Emporium.
[10215.20s -> 10216.08s]  Break it, you buy it.
[10216.64s -> 10220.27s]  It's a big seal-cut area.
[10226.03s -> 10226.35s]  Okay.
[10242.62s -> 10244.46s]  How much is it?
[10251.13s -> 10256.65s]  Captain, found true love, you see, and had no need to sail no more.
[10256.65s -> 10258.57s]  So he stole me this here pulley.
[10258.57s -> 10259.77s]  How much does it cost?
[10260.73s -> 10262.56s]  How much does it cost?
[10262.56s -> 10263.52s]  What do I need to give you?
[10263.52s -> 10264.08s]  Well, how do I get one?
[10264.08s -> 10266.88s]  Hey Barnacle Bob, tell us about that pulley.
[10269.12s -> 10273.92s]  It's from the schooner Hesperus that sailed the wintry sea.
[10273.92s -> 10278.32s]  The skipper had taken his daughter along and she stole this here pulley to me.
[10278.32s -> 10279.12s]  I'm just going to take it.
[10284.04s -> 10285.08s]  That was cool.
[10285.08s -> 10287.80s]  I'll bet there's a neat story behind that pulley.
[10287.80s -> 10288.60s]  They're not for sale.
[10288.60s -> 10289.80s]  It says big sail on it.
[10289.80s -> 10291.00s]  It says big sail.
[10291.00s -> 10294.92s]  Come down to the sea, my friends, to the lonely sea from the sky.
[10294.92s -> 10299.24s]  From the port bow of a tall ship that sailed from Paraguay.
[10300.36s -> 10301.96s]  Okay, big sail.
[10303.23s -> 10306.51s]  Great stories abound in your pulley Emporium.
[10306.51s -> 10309.71s]  Just point to a pulley and I'll tell you some more of them.
[10310.59s -> 10316.88s]  This business is a fucking flop, man.
[10316.88s -> 10317.44s]  I'm sorry.
[10320.89s -> 10322.01s]  Okay, let's go up to the hall of fame.
[10324.51s -> 10328.51s]  Oh, there's a look.
[10329.15s -> 10330.11s]  Look at Freddie.
[10330.11s -> 10331.87s]  Aren't you scared of the ghost?
[10331.87s -> 10333.15s]  No, not really.
[10335.87s -> 10336.67s]  I don't need these anymore.
[10347.20s -> 10350.48s]  King Crab donated his pearls to build this hall of fame.
[10351.28s -> 10351.76s]  Trophy.
[10352.64s -> 10356.32s]  Tina Tuna held her breath above water for 13 minutes.
[10356.32s -> 10365.76s]  Sturgeon won four gold medals in the all-ocean powerlifting competition.
[10365.76s -> 10366.08s]  Cool.
[10366.08s -> 10367.12s]  All right, give me the trophy.
[10367.12s -> 10370.64s]  That's the trophy I won for the deep sea spelling bee.
[10370.64s -> 10373.04s]  I was going to pick it up after school today.
[10374.72s -> 10378.16s]  Darn, the trophy case is locked.
[10379.92s -> 10380.56s]  So open it.
[10381.36s -> 10383.92s]  I wonder who we could get the combination from.
[10383.92s -> 10384.56s]  Oh, come on.
[10385.88s -> 10388.44s]  Hey, I think this fell off the back of the lock.
[10389.24s -> 10390.60s]  From the key with the glasses?
[10390.60s -> 10397.00s]  It says to get the combination to this lock, show this card to Mr. Triplefin.
[10398.04s -> 10402.36s]  So if we show this card to Mr. Triplefin, he'll give us the combination.
[10402.36s -> 10403.08s]  Who?
[10403.08s -> 10404.12s]  Hello, sir.
[10404.12s -> 10405.32s]  You're a genius.
[10405.32s -> 10406.28s]  Who's Mr. Triplefin?
[10406.28s -> 10406.78s]  I know.
[10408.04s -> 10413.18s]  So that trophy case is locked.
[10413.18s -> 10416.94s]  Repeatedly jiggling the handle is just an exercise in futility.
[10416.94s -> 10417.42s]  Who's that?
[10421.13s -> 10422.09s]  It's a guy with a guitar.
[10422.89s -> 10424.25s]  I gotta go all the way back there.
[10426.17s -> 10426.49s]  Shit.
[10428.09s -> 10431.13s]  That's not Triplefin.
[10444.80s -> 10455.63s]  Somebody said this is straw ass all over again.
[10460.11s -> 10464.40s]  All right, we gotta go this way.
[10466.73s -> 10468.97s]  Please play Spy Fox and Pajama Sam.
[10469.93s -> 10472.86s]  I'm gonna treat these like animes.
[10472.86s -> 10474.62s]  I'm gonna watch one every year.
[10475.66s -> 10477.37s]  I'll do one every year.
[10478.09s -> 10482.14s]  All the way.
[10482.14s -> 10482.62s]  Where was it?
[10482.62s -> 10482.86s]  Down?
[10484.30s -> 10493.05s]  Where was that guy with the guitar?
[10494.97s -> 10496.49s]  We're gonna play unpacking after this.
[10502.59s -> 10503.39s]  Did I just come from here?
[10504.19s -> 10505.15s]  Not this guy.
[10505.15s -> 10506.43s]  No, I'm in the wrong place.
[10506.43s -> 10507.39s]  Where the hell do I need to go?
[10508.27s -> 10519.50s]  I'm gonna play Madden 09.
[10519.50s -> 10523.08s]  No, where was it?
[10523.08s -> 10524.04s]  It was to the right?
[10524.84s -> 10527.66s]  No, it was up that way, right?
[10528.46s -> 10529.18s]  I think it was this way.
[10533.76s -> 10534.64s]  I'm gonna go around.
[10535.28s -> 10537.28s]  Oh, yeah, this is a huge pain in the ass.
[10539.64s -> 10540.92s]  He hates Madden 09.
[10542.76s -> 10544.28s]  Yeah, I probably do.
[10557.84s -> 10559.04s]  All right, all the way down.
[10559.04s -> 10560.56s]  Then we're finally gonna get our last thing
[10560.56s -> 10562.56s]  and then we're gonna be able to complete this video game.
[10562.56s -> 10565.44s]  I'm not gonna let that phony go scare me.
[10565.44s -> 10567.44s]  The Freddy Fish Trilogy series.
[10567.44s -> 10568.24s]  Please don't let him scare me either, Freddy.
[10571.37s -> 10572.33s]  What's this?
[10573.13s -> 10575.05s]  Hey, you giving me the business?
[10575.45s -> 10577.77s]  Your business card, sir.
[10577.77s -> 10579.05s]  Well, so it is.
[10579.85s -> 10583.21s]  You boys will be wanting a combination to the trophy case.
[10583.21s -> 10586.09s]  Excuse me, sir, but I'm not a boy.
[10586.09s -> 10587.21s]  I'm a girl.
[10587.21s -> 10588.81s]  Hey, that's a coincidence.
[10588.81s -> 10590.41s]  So is Mrs. Triple Finn.
[10592.25s -> 10594.73s]  Thanks for the combination, Mr. Triple Finn.
[10597.04s -> 10600.97s]  This says a combination to the lot.
[10600.97s -> 10604.57s]  The Barbie Fashion Show PC 2004.
[10604.57s -> 10607.85s]  No, we're not just gonna pull up every single old
[10607.85s -> 10612.65s]  point and click kids game from 1995 to 2002.
[10612.65s -> 10613.53s]  We're not doing that.
[10614.09s -> 10615.85s]  This was a direct special request
[10616.81s -> 10618.97s]  because it was somebody's birthday, okay?
[10618.97s -> 10620.01s]  You wanna know the truth?
[10620.01s -> 10620.81s]  It was somebody's birthday.
[10620.81s -> 10621.53s]  This was a birthday present
[10621.53s -> 10623.13s]  for the person that requested it on their birthday.
[10623.13s -> 10624.17s]  This is a birthday present.
[10624.17s -> 10625.29s]  So there it is.
[10625.29s -> 10625.93s]  Cat's out of the bag.
[10626.65s -> 10627.69s]  This was a birthday present
[10629.90s -> 10631.58s]  and it's not your birthday.
[10631.58s -> 10639.60s]  So somebody in chat is probably going like,
[10641.42s -> 10642.14s]  wait, was it me?
[10642.78s -> 10644.59s]  I requested this on my birthday.
[10648.22s -> 10657.85s]  Is unpacking a good game?
[10658.57s -> 10661.05s]  I feel like I've played it for like 10 minutes.
[10663.69s -> 10671.74s]  It's my birthday.
[10671.74s -> 10673.26s]  Can you watch porn on stream?
[10674.54s -> 10692.03s]  What a bizarre.
[10692.59s -> 10694.59s]  Oh yeah, we're gonna fulfill a birthday request.
[10694.59s -> 10696.75s]  I'm gonna go watch porn on stream,
[10703.48s -> 10704.68s]  but it's their birthday.
[10708.28s -> 10708.92s]  Okay, let's go.
[10709.40s -> 10712.99s]  I bet we can get this lock open now.
[10715.04s -> 10716.08s]  Five, six, seven.
[10726.92s -> 10729.72s]  We have all the infinity stones.
[10729.72s -> 10730.36s]  We can make the trap.
[10732.36s -> 10734.36s]  Gee, it looks expensive.
[10735.40s -> 10738.84s]  Looks like it's made out of gold.
[10738.84s -> 10741.72s]  No, Luther, the trophy isn't gold.
[10741.72s -> 10743.24s]  Critique stream would be hilarious.
[10745.00s -> 10746.60s]  I don't think you understand what happens
[10746.60s -> 10748.36s]  if that stream is live.
[10749.64s -> 10751.32s]  I go away.
[10758.40s -> 10759.36s]  All right, I got everything.
[10760.00s -> 10760.78s]  Let's do it.
[10768.76s -> 10773.32s]  Give me the super duper thingy.
[10793.48s -> 10796.12s]  I know how much that trophy meant to you.
[10796.12s -> 10797.80s]  It's okay, Luther.
[10797.80s -> 10800.76s]  I remember how special it was to win it,
[10800.76s -> 10802.76s]  and that's what really matters.
[10802.76s -> 10803.80s]  Freddy just got ripped off.
[10805.08s -> 10807.64s]  Let's go catch that ghost.
[10807.64s -> 10808.92s]  All right, let's get the ghost.
[10808.92s -> 10809.72s]  This is it.
[10809.72s -> 10811.88s]  This is the culmination of the whole entire series.
[10811.88s -> 10813.96s]  We're ready to make our trap, Luther.
[10815.56s -> 10823.08s]  Are we trying to kill this guy?
[10824.60s -> 10827.64s]  That's just about everything.
[10827.64s -> 10830.52s]  Luther, can we use your toy as bait?
[10831.24s -> 10832.36s]  Well, okay.
[10835.34s -> 10842.40s]  Our trap is complete.
[10842.40s -> 10844.56s]  Hey, boss, look.
[10844.56s -> 10845.92s]  A toy.
[10845.92s -> 10847.12s]  Let's grab it.
[10847.12s -> 10848.08s]  It's these two.
[10871.05s -> 10873.61s]  It's Freddy, bitch.
[10873.61s -> 10874.73s]  And Luther.
[10876.28s -> 10877.00s]  Whoa, we got him.
[10878.81s -> 10879.31s]  We got him.
[10880.49s -> 10885.40s]  Could you two scare the poor little guppies
[10885.40s -> 10886.68s]  and steal their toys?
[10886.68s -> 10887.64s]  It's the two sharks.
[10887.64s -> 10888.36s]  What the fuck?
[10888.92s -> 10889.80s]  It's the two sharks.
[10891.80s -> 10892.30s]  What?
[10893.64s -> 10894.14s]  Whoa.
[10911.93s -> 10912.73s]  These gotta hold up.
[10912.73s -> 10913.29s]  They still do.
[10913.29s -> 10915.53s]  Here, give this to the squid father.
[10915.53s -> 10917.37s]  He should have at least one toy.
[10918.33s -> 10920.68s]  Well, we're giving the toy where...
[10920.68s -> 10922.68s]  Isn't this just enabling that bad behavior?
[10922.68s -> 10926.64s]  Luther, let's take these toys back to the...
[10926.64s -> 10928.16s]  Isn't the whole point of this that
[10928.16s -> 10931.20s]  they were sending the bad guys to go steal the toy
[10931.20s -> 10933.20s]  and we just gave the toy to them at the end?
[10933.20s -> 10933.70s]  Hooray.
[10934.72s -> 10937.92s]  We solved the mystery, Mrs. Croaker.
[10937.92s -> 10942.00s]  There wasn't really a ghost haunting the school.
[10942.00s -> 10945.92s]  It was just those sharks pretending to be a ghost.
[10945.92s -> 10947.84s]  Congratulations.
[10947.84s -> 10949.36s]  You saved the school.
[10950.72s -> 10952.08s]  The messages to share.
[10954.72s -> 10957.12s]  Okay, I understand the messages to share,
[10957.12s -> 10959.90s]  but they're trying to kill us.
[10967.16s -> 10967.72s]  Selfish.
[10968.44s -> 10970.86s]  These guys are dressing up in a costume
[10970.86s -> 10972.22s]  talking about how they were going to get us
[10972.22s -> 10975.82s]  and trying to like come and scare the kids and shit.
[10976.86s -> 10986.41s]  I'm missing out on clicking stuff.
[10986.41s -> 10987.77s]  How dare you guys say that to me?
[11000.35s -> 11000.85s]  I can't.
[11001.31s -> 11003.15s]  Somebody said the moral of the story is to...
[11004.75s -> 11008.99s]  I can't even fucking read it.
[11008.99s -> 11011.63s]  The moral of the story is to stomp the bad guys' teeth
[11011.63s -> 11012.51s]  into their brains.
[11013.15s -> 11015.63s]  No, that's not what I said either, by the way.
[11016.19s -> 11017.15s]  That's not what I said.
[11022.75s -> 11024.11s]  That is not what I said either.
[11031.63s -> 11035.16s]  The moral of the story is fucking consumerism.
[11039.69s -> 11040.41s]  Stop clicking.
[11040.41s -> 11041.93s]  That's what you do in this game.
[11044.01s -> 11054.97s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[11061.52s -> 11064.00s]  What's in that?
[11065.13s -> 11066.17s]  Oh, magical gold.
[11067.53s -> 11075.66s]  The moral of the story is I want all the toys for myself.
[11076.70s -> 11079.45s]  Everybody coming over here with a toy is not mine.
[11082.46s -> 11083.18s]  Give me that toy.
[11083.18s -> 11083.58s]  What is it?
[11083.58s -> 11083.98s]  I want it.
[11084.62s -> 11085.31s]  Watch out.
[11085.31s -> 11085.95s]  Give me that skull.
[11085.95s -> 11086.59s]  Give me that one.
[11086.59s -> 11087.07s]  The whole thing.
[11087.79s -> 11094.08s]  Give me that.
[11095.12s -> 11095.44s]  Pop that.
[11095.44s -> 11096.64s]  I don't want anyone to play with me.
[11096.64s -> 11097.14s]  Pop it.
[11097.92s -> 11099.30s]  What's this?
[11101.44s -> 11102.00s]  Cheap shit.
[11102.00s -> 11102.56s]  Get it out of here.
[11105.08s -> 11106.46s]  Do that again.
[11119.74s -> 11121.02s]  Okay, I'm done.
[11121.02s -> 11122.78s]  Do you want to start the game all over?
[11123.74s -> 11124.24s]  No.
[11125.02s -> 11125.50s]  That was fun.
[11125.50s -> 11126.94s]  That was Freddy Fish 2.
[11128.52s -> 11134.76s]  The curse of the mean antagonists that continue to cause a problem.
[11135.80s -> 11140.28s]  In Freddy Fish 3, they'll be stealing the fucking pie off the sill.
[11140.28s -> 11141.00s]  See you next time.
[11143.48s -> 11144.60s]  We're gonna play the other game.
[11144.60s -> 11145.32s]  That was fun.
[11145.32s -> 11146.60s]  That was actually really, I liked it.
[11149.88s -> 11151.48s]  Legendary boring stream.
[11152.36s -> 11156.06s]  You almost just got me to hiss into the camera, which would change your mind.
[11156.06s -> 11161.07s]  But no, I'm just hanging out playing kids games.
[11161.79s -> 11162.43s]  It doesn't matter.
[11167.63s -> 11168.59s]  I was gonna hiss at you.
[11170.51s -> 11173.71s]  Remember, you're 36.
[11178.68s -> 11179.80s]  All right, you guys ready?
[11179.80s -> 11180.60s]  We're gonna move on.
[11180.60s -> 11183.48s]  We are gonna play Unpacking.
[11184.36s -> 11186.44s]  It's a game where I have to, I think, decorate a room.
[11187.24s -> 11188.76s]  I'm looking very much forward to it.
[11188.76s -> 11191.48s]  It's gonna be such a chill, relaxing stream.
[11191.48s -> 11193.08s]  I recommend you have it in another tab.
[11193.56s -> 11196.04s]  Maybe just sit back, relax, maybe have a little bit of snack.
[11196.68s -> 11197.32s]  We'll go for it.
[11197.32s -> 11198.92s]  Let's go.
