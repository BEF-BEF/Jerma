[1.40s -> 10.97s]  Okay, so I had the- something's wrong. My ethernet port's fucked up, but whatever. All right, we're good. We're here.
[15.37s -> 20.20s]  Okay, let me ask you a question. Do you- all right, do you think- and by the way, I'm not even late.
[20.28s -> 25.32s]  I'm not even- it's supposed to be between 10 and 11 a.m. And I was early. Good thing I was fucking early, huh?
[26.46s -> 31.98s]  Because the stream was supposed to start between 10 and 11. Oh boy, good thing I turned it on at like 9 40.
[33.38s -> 36.31s]  Ugh. Ooh.
[37.03s -> 43.51s]  Not happy. Not happy. All right, technically not late.
[43.75s -> 48.07s]  Yeah, we're gonna play this game. I- I- in the process, I was getting ready.
[48.79s -> 50.95s]  I've wanted to play this since it kind of came up.
[52.54s -> 54.70s]  All guys back up. I'm not playing it. No.
[55.85s -> 59.13s]  No, I'm- I'm over it. I'm over it. We're playing barn finders.
[64.38s -> 76.97s]  I'm over it. I'm playing barn finders instead. And plus, I- I have the Twitter open. I can see that the servers are still done. No.
[77.53s -> 90.12s]  I'm back. Let's see. I'm gonna check to see if the-
[91.40s -> 93.40s]  Good thing I started fucking early.
[94.20s -> 97.16s]  Good thing the stream started like 30 minutes early.
[97.72s -> 104.22s]  What does it say?
[104.22s -> 108.38s]  We're aware of issues affecting matchmaking right now. We're working on a fix. It's not- it's not ready.
[108.86s -> 111.42s]  We're gonna play barn finders until it is.
[117.10s -> 121.42s]  And I don't even need to do an intro. I don't want- let's go. We're gonna play barn finders.
[122.94s -> 125.30s]  Are you ready?
[125.30s -> 128.66s]  No, Drew? No, I couldn't do it. I was gonna- oh, I- I would- I couldn't do it.
[128.66s -> 131.86s]  I was about to open it. I double clicked it and I was like, I don't want to fucking play this game.
[132.26s -> 133.38s]  I don't want to do this.
[133.38s -> 139.18s]  Now, who do I want to be? I promise this game's gonna be interesting. You're gonna love this one. I promise.
[139.82s -> 143.56s]  Okay, let me-
[143.56s -> 148.28s]  see if this works.
[148.28s -> 153.45s]  Hello? All right. I don't want to- I want to be-
[154.41s -> 157.96s]  I think there's a- there's a picture of me online that looks like this.
[160.36s -> 164.60s]  That's like every face I make in every photo. All right, what about- okay. Yeah, absolutely. One of these too.
[165.70s -> 171.14s]  I think this one.
[171.14s -> 174.31s]  Character's name?
[174.31s -> 176.31s]  Um, I don't know. How about, uh,
[178.60s -> 180.49s]  beer?
[180.49s -> 182.17s]  That's too easy though.
[182.17s -> 189.74s]  What's the title of this stream? I have like rage made that- what is it? What is it? Hunting for treasure trusts.
[189.82s -> 191.66s]  Okay, that's fucking-
[191.66s -> 193.66s]  It's gonna stay. I don't even care.
[194.15s -> 198.18s]  All right, let's go. Fine, it'll- it could be beer.
[202.42s -> 204.17s]  All right, that's good.
[204.17s -> 207.13s]  Barn finders. Profile represents your save file. All right, let's go.
[209.00s -> 209.96s]  New game.
[209.96s -> 214.81s]  Wait, hold on a minute.
[214.81s -> 216.81s]  FOV, make sure that's over 90 degrees.
[217.67s -> 219.67s]  FPS limiter, excuse me.
[219.75s -> 221.59s]  Oh, sensitivity way down.
[221.59s -> 229.35s]  All right, let's accept those settings.
[229.35s -> 232.87s]  Are you sure to start a new game? I- I hope so.
[233.75s -> 237.66s]  Who's the audio? How do I- how do I reduce audio?
[241.42s -> 243.99s]  All right, let's go.
[243.99s -> 249.03s]  So this is a game where you have to buy and sell shit that you find in barns. You're gonna do this in an auction system.
[249.83s -> 253.72s]  It was on the recommended in the discord. You can- you this mounts?
[259.67s -> 262.15s]  Like, did I run over that chicken? What was it?
[275.58s -> 279.82s]  Ah, the life of a GTA 5 NPC during the Trevor campaign.
[286.84s -> 288.60s]  Uncle Billy?
[288.60s -> 298.52s]  What game is- what are we playing?
[298.84s -> 308.57s]  This is- no, this is not Duck Dynasty. This is-
[309.53s -> 311.53s]  It's auctions and buying and stuff.
[312.41s -> 314.41s]  You have to find like hidden treasures in-
[315.05s -> 318.17s]  What's the name of that game where they yell at each other and they buy storage units?
[318.65s -> 322.97s]  And like they go through like old dirty diapers and somebody finds an old ring that's worth like 60 dollars.
[323.05s -> 325.05s]  What's- what's that called? What's the show called?
[325.05s -> 327.45s]  Did Wars? Storage Wars. Yes, that's what we're playing.
[328.09s -> 337.26s]  Okay, somewhere in America.
[337.34s -> 340.38s]  Uncle Billy, wake up. Young and our generator's down.
[343.93s -> 352.28s]  Get a battery for my truck and fix it. Let's work awful hard. Our vacation waits.
[354.57s -> 361.78s]  Take a battery from your truck. Place it in the generator. Hold on. This is like Skyrim. I just pick up everything?
[362.42s -> 365.96s]  What? It's got money? I got three dollars for taking that? What was it?
[366.60s -> 372.89s]  Press and hold to throw item. Turn the game up, please.
[376.63s -> 378.63s]  Okay, I got you. I got you.
[379.11s -> 382.55s]  Okay, now that was way too loud. Why is there a really loud bugawk sound?
[383.94s -> 385.54s]  Okay, is that better?
[385.54s -> 393.74s]  No, do I have to do it? Can I sell my coffee pots?
[395.46s -> 396.68s]  Recycle.
[396.68s -> 401.00s]  Six dollars. It gives valuable item, usable object. What's in here? Recycle everything.
[403.50s -> 406.14s]  Do I not eat the food? I just recycle the food. I don't eat it.
[411.24s -> 412.86s]  Recycling.
[412.86s -> 416.68s]  Can I recycle my bed? Can I recycle my toilet?
[417.40s -> 425.13s]  What's in here?
[425.13s -> 426.41s]  Can I crouch?
[426.41s -> 428.41s]  Yeah. All right. Well, recycle this.
[428.49s -> 432.25s]  I got 30 bucks. All right. So now what do I do with the 30 dollars?
[432.81s -> 444.90s]  Recycle this.
[444.90s -> 450.58s]  Welcome to Barn Finders. Get car battery from the car's trunk. Put it into the generator and use your computer
[450.90s -> 474.54s]  to find jobs and travel all over America. The server's a backup. I'm playing Barn Finders for at least half an hour.
[478.74s -> 480.74s]  All right. Can I sell this to somebody?
[480.82s -> 493.96s]  All right. Where's the truck? Why all sounds low, but the chickens sound. Come on. Wait, can I play basketball?
[503.37s -> 505.61s]  Okay, I think I've seen that on Vine.
[506.25s -> 507.77s]  Like 30 times.
[507.77s -> 521.80s]  That's every popular video on trending that was on Vine. All right. I got it. Nice. Wait, wait, wait. I'm supposed to get
[522.04s -> 528.36s]  Wait, wait, wait. Where's my truck? This is my truck. All right, get in the truck.
[528.76s -> 537.67s]  Holy shit, this guy scared the hell out of me. Okay, battery. Get the battery from the truck.
[541.46s -> 548.17s]  Weapons? All right, battery. All right, then we take the battery. Put it in the generator.
[551.21s -> 555.08s]  No, this is it right there. Gunshot.
[557.05s -> 560.65s]  All right, cool. Check your computer for a job. I got it. Now my computer turns on.
[561.29s -> 569.83s]  Oh god, okay. I'm afraid to open these.
[571.82s -> 573.82s]  A naughty stag for a friend.
[574.14s -> 576.30s]  Hello barn finders. Can you help an old friend?
[576.78s -> 581.74s]  So I heard there's a still a naughty stag at the old red barn. Maybe you could find it there for you.
[582.22s -> 584.22s]  There's money in it if you do.
[585.38s -> 589.78s]  Find the old stag at the red barn. All right, let's go to barn hub.
[594.12s -> 597.64s]  Travel bike. Wait, you drive cars in this game? It's automatic plus one liter grade.
[598.86s -> 603.13s]  Need to go to the red barn. Oh, I don't know. I only have 30 bucks.
[606.23s -> 614.70s]  Travel to red barn. Can I pick up the brick? I can't pick up a fucking brick. Are you kidding me?
[615.10s -> 620.09s]  I would have given this game like a full letter grid. All right, let's go. So how do I get there?
[622.18s -> 624.18s]  Michelle, wait, you open your shop?
[627.32s -> 637.99s]  Spam emails are cool. Check them out. All right. How do I drive the car? How did you get over here?
[641.64s -> 643.24s]  What? How did he get over there?
[643.24s -> 649.32s]  All right, store items. Store quest items. All right, I gotta go to red barn. What's it? But do I have a map?
[651.59s -> 653.83s]  How am I supposed to find red barn?
[655.42s -> 666.50s]  Just go to the only red barn in town? I have to go to the computer. I didn't have enough money.
[671.18s -> 676.44s]  Item cap. Barn hub. Here, red barn. Travel one gas.
[678.68s -> 690.79s]  How do I get gas? Can I buy gas? Gas, gas, gas, gas. Auto parts?
[691.51s -> 700.63s]  This looks incredibly elaborate. Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.
[701.43s -> 713.99s]  Call mom. Where do you get gas? Antiques, play, death ray, tv.
[715.83s -> 718.15s]  Buy gas on the computer. No, you don't.
[719.53s -> 731.00s]  Where's the gas? Gas is on the map? Yeah, I don't know. I don't have any gas.
[731.80s -> 746.38s]  This is probably a stray gas can. Is this it? I just need to sell. I need a can of gas.
[748.76s -> 758.28s]  Recycle all your trash and buy gas. Wait a minute. Ah, look at that. I got one gas. Nice. Okay, cool.
[758.28s -> 777.16s]  Now we can go. All right, I'm ready. Remove motion blur? It shouldn't be on. I don't think there's
[777.16s -> 785.53s]  an option to remove it. Resolution, full screen. Yeah, texture quality. GPU memory. 700 million,
[785.53s -> 792.89s]  whatever it is. Oh, motion blur. Okay, grain. Get that off too. Uh, everything else is okay.
[793.69s -> 805.40s]  All right, let's go. All right, red barn. We got one gas. It's just a cut scene to drive the car.
[805.40s -> 822.10s]  That's hard. You gotta give me control of the car. Use resources to fix broken items. Turn off v-sync?
[831.67s -> 836.46s]  You would die on the way to the red barn if they let you drive.
[837.26s -> 845.45s]  Okay, maybe. All right, tutorial. As a barn finder, your job is to find requested items.
[845.45s -> 849.29s]  Look for other valuable items. You can sell them in your shop. Search for additional items
[849.29s -> 854.20s]  and secrets. All right, let's find a secret. Definitely one right here,
[854.84s -> 867.26s]  but it's probably stuff under things, right? Crash. Oh, that famous red barn. Let's explore. Oh,
[870.33s -> 875.75s]  open it up. Do I have a flashlight? Cigarettes. That's worth at least 10 bucks.
[876.79s -> 887.00s]  Oh, I actually kind of like this game. You just make money by recycling stuff and clean up a house.
[887.80s -> 904.36s]  Look at chat. You're blind. What? What? What? What? What? Sorry for interrupting your plans,
[904.36s -> 929.06s]  Jermis. Oh, now I feel like a dick. I feel like an asshole now. Oh, no. No. Was I like a whiny
[929.06s -> 936.23s]  streamer? Shit. No, I wasn't. No, I wasn't. You didn't hear it. I was off camera when I was gone.
[936.23s -> 947.58s]  That's a fake account. That's a not even a real account. No, I wasn't on camera.
[948.46s -> 963.61s]  You didn't hear anything. Oh, this is worth $70. Oh, 70 bucks. Well, the zoom in and zoom out.
[963.61s -> 970.63s]  All right, let's mark that for transport. Wait, study it. Why do I study it? Transport it. Press
[970.63s -> 981.90s]  T to transport. Transport it. Pick up in three, two. Oh, okay. He just takes it. Can I transport
[981.90s -> 1025.75s]  this stuff? You baited by people. No, it's real. I don't have a key. Wait, it is. Let's go. Let's
[1025.75s -> 1063.67s]  go. Let's go. Right. Let's go. Back up. Is it working? No. No, don't do that. No, it's for real.
[1063.67s -> 1074.44s]  Has to be. Looking for a game to capture. Okay, here we go. Was it right? Come on. I'm just going.
[1074.44s -> 1077.88s]  I'm going. Let's go. Let's go. This is it. Let's go. Let's go. It's real. It's real. It's real. It's
[1078.52s -> 1125.85s]  real. Wait, hold on. What happened? That is real though, isn't it? You're so gullible.
[1125.85s -> 1143.13s]  But wait, hold on. Hold on a minute. You fucking really just got me with this shit? This person
[1143.13s -> 1155.03s]  didn't tweet that. You linked me a fake account of this person. That's supposed to be... That's not
[1155.11s -> 1168.15s]  okay. I was so ready. I was like, this is the... Okay. And I... Oh my God. And you even did like
[1168.15s -> 1173.75s]  the little... Oh, like, hey, at German 985. Sorry about that. Like, hoot. Oh, come on, man.
[1177.69s -> 1181.45s]  That's just my ego getting in the way. Like, oh, the Fall Guys guy hit me up. He must have seen
[1181.45s -> 1186.33s]  my stream. One of the top streams for Fall Guys. He must have came in and said, hey, man.
[1187.29s -> 1202.62s]  Oh, fucking dammit. You guys, seriously, what the fuck? All right, we're playing AI. I just... I
[1202.62s -> 1208.94s]  was in the middle of doing that. I was in the middle of doing something else. This is a fake
[1208.94s -> 1216.41s]  person. Wait, is it? No, it's a real person. How did you even do... Wait, Fall Guys owl.
[1217.05s -> 1229.42s]  What's the real person's name? This is... That's not all right. I'm playing AI dungeon. God damn it.
[1229.42s -> 1237.42s]  Why did I... I got absolutely... I got absolutely baited there. That's the worst one in a long time.
[1238.38s -> 1243.26s]  I was in the middle of playing something else. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Okay. Here we go. AI dungeon
[1243.26s -> 1252.49s]  is what we're doing for now. I... What am I... Wait, I fucked it all up. Sending me like... All
[1252.49s -> 1257.53s]  right. Like, you may as well say that, like, if I send you to Bitcoin, you'll send me four.
[1258.09s -> 1261.77s]  Like, seriously, like, I just... I thought that was real. I clicked on it. I'm like, oh, this guy's
[1261.77s -> 1291.05s]  real. I trusted. I prepared myself for this shit. I'm so fucking sad.
[1298.63s -> 1307.93s]  All right. What we got? What should I pick? It's not even a real person. Stop tweeting at me,
[1307.93s -> 1317.29s]  this guy. This is a fake account. He's probably gonna get his account removed. Yeah. LOL. Sorry.
[1317.29s -> 1321.45s]  All right. Well, have fun with, like, your account. What do you want me to know?
[1322.09s -> 1330.30s]  He apologized. It's a real account. It's not a real account. I can't fucking believe it. I cannot
[1330.30s -> 1338.14s]  believe it. I am so... Words cannot even describe how just upset I am right now. I can't even tell
[1338.14s -> 1345.18s]  you. I didn't even save that last game, too. And now I'm going to be so turned off on that one.
[1345.18s -> 1351.66s]  All right. Let's do fantasy. Select a character. What's it going to do? What is it going to get
[1351.66s -> 1368.89s]  warmed up? All right. I want to be a wizard. Now I need, like, music, too, for this. I wasn't
[1368.89s -> 1376.79s]  ready for this shit. Fantasy music. Your character's name. Garfield. No, Garfield.
[1377.35s -> 1386.02s]  All right. Here we go. Didn't you guys say that? Is it text to speech?
[1403.21s -> 1404.33s]  Only for premium. Oh.
[1413.29s -> 1457.77s]  Why are you laughing? Why is the rat laughing? Why is... Why are they laughing?
[1462.79s -> 1472.60s]  Why are you laughing? Do I need to put it in quotes? Don't ask questions. Ask why are you
[1472.60s -> 1487.35s]  laughing, right? Say why are you laughing, right? Do I need that in quotes? Oh, you can't see.
[1496.25s -> 1510.15s]  You say, oh, that's new. Okay. So that works, right? You say, why are you laughing?
[1510.79s -> 1516.01s]  Man suddenly turns around and blasts you with a bolt of pure energy. You fall to the ground in
[1516.01s -> 1528.20s]  pain and see the book on the other side of the room. Okay. Do. What do you do? Grab at my pearls.
[1529.08s -> 1537.43s]  I don't know why. I don't know what that means. You grab at your pearls. You can't find your pearl
[1537.43s -> 1542.63s]  necklace and you feel something sharp prick your finger. It's your necklace. And the pearls are
[1542.63s -> 1564.95s]  back to normal that they must have been deleted from. Okay. Attack. Attack the rat. Attack the
[1564.95s -> 1573.96s]  rat man. You attack the rat man. You grab a rock from the ground and hurl it at the man. The rock
[1573.96s -> 1583.96s]  flies straight at the man who was too stunned to move out of the way. Throw another rock at his
[1583.96s -> 1594.02s]  head. You throw another rock at his head. The man turns around just in time to avoid the rock.
[1594.02s -> 1599.70s]  He sees another rock on the ground and picks it up preparing to throw it. You grab another rock
[1599.70s -> 1609.70s]  and throw it at the man. Dodge the rock. This guy has spells. Why does he need to do this yet?
[1610.84s -> 1621.14s]  Dodge the rock. You dodge the rock. The rock lands next to the rat man. Suddenly the rat man leaps
[1621.22s -> 1631.10s]  at you and bites your throat. You fall to the ground gasping for air. Grab rock and smash
[1631.10s -> 1642.54s]  his head. You grab a rock and smash his head. You grab a rock and hurl it at the rat man. The rock
[1642.54s -> 1653.66s]  lands on his head. Okay. Wasn't he on top of me? You grab a rock and hurl at the man. The rock
[1653.66s -> 1659.90s]  lands on his head. Your head starts to throb. Suddenly you fall down on the ground and fall
[1659.90s -> 1674.52s]  unconscious. Say, is there anyone out here who can help me? You throw it in the air and it fell
[1674.52s -> 1686.73s]  back on his head. You say, is there anyone out here who can help me? Your mouth tastes horrible.
[1686.73s -> 1693.02s]  Your mouth tastes horrible. You're lying on the ground. You look up and see a human standing above
[1693.02s -> 1711.62s]  you. He grabs your hand. Say, thank you. No, I'm, I'm in bad shape. I'm in bad shape. Slap his hand
[1711.62s -> 1718.39s]  away. I'm in bad shape. Don't worry. We'll get your help. Suddenly you feel the worst pain of
[1718.39s -> 1729.37s]  your life in your stomach. You fall on the ground and start to lose consciousness. Say, I ate raw
[1729.37s -> 1749.86s]  eggs earlier. Can you bring me to someone who can help? You're having organ failure. I ate raw
[1749.86s -> 1755.14s]  eggs earlier. Can you bring me to someone who can help me? He starts dragging you on the ground
[1755.14s -> 1760.82s]  towards the nearest village. You look up at him and see that his eyes are completely black. The man
[1760.82s -> 1780.36s]  is not a man. He is a monster. What kind of monster are you? I'm a man. What kind of monster are you?
[1781.00s -> 1787.10s]  You continue to get dragged on the ground. Suddenly you fall asleep. Your eyes flutter open and you
[1787.10s -> 1797.22s]  see the sun. Wait, so I just completely totally like misjudged this guy? Is he, am I, am I
[1797.22s -> 1802.52s]  hallucinating? What's going on here? All right. You flutter your eyes up and you see the sun. Okay.
[1804.25s -> 1817.42s]  Stare into the sun. You stare into the sun. You suddenly feel much better. You are in so much pain.
[1817.42s -> 1825.59s]  You just want to lay down and die. You look up at the sky and see a beautiful girl in a red dress.
[1825.59s -> 1834.87s]  Stare at sun until it hurts. No, until stare at sun and continue staring directly into sun.
[1834.87s -> 1853.05s]  I spell that right? You continue staring directly into the sun. The beautiful girl reaches her hand.
[1853.05s -> 1861.10s]  Suddenly you feel a blast of heat on your face. You scream in pain. Wait, is this from looking at
[1861.10s -> 1869.11s]  the sun? You start screaming in pain and fall to the ground. How many times? I'm just on the ground.
[1869.11s -> 1877.34s]  All right. Get up. You look around and see the man dragging you. You ask him what he is doing,
[1877.34s -> 1892.95s]  but he just ignores you. You feel like you're going to die. What do you do? I stand up. You stand up.
[1892.95s -> 1901.29s]  The man continues dragging you towards the village. Suddenly you notice a hole in your stomach.
[1901.29s -> 1907.13s]  You fall down and pass out. You face, your face becomes increasingly numb as you lose consciousness.
[1910.12s -> 1920.07s]  Do you have any water? No, do you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Do you have any
[1920.07s -> 1939.64s]  Gatorade? How do you spell Gatorade? Like that, right? Do you have any Gatorade? He stops dragging
[1939.64s -> 1957.90s]  you and looks at you. I don't have time for your foolishness. Say, do you have any water about
[1957.90s -> 1965.77s]  Powerade? He walks over to a nearby tap and takes a drink from it. And I have some water.
[1965.77s -> 1980.44s]  He pauses and thinks for a moment. I'll ask my wife if she has any. Where is your wife? Oh shit.
[1980.44s -> 1991.06s]  Oh no. Where is your wife? He starts dragging you again. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your back.
[1991.06s -> 1999.43s]  You continue screaming as the man drags you into the village. I'm getting my fucking ass kicked.
[1999.43s -> 2014.15s]  Give me water. Scum. You say, give me water, scum. He looks over his shoulder at you. Shut up,
[2014.15s -> 2019.59s]  or I'll give you something to really scream about. He continues dragging you. You finally
[2019.59s -> 2045.59s]  reach the edge of the village. What do you do? Cry. Start crying. You start crying. You're not
[2045.59s -> 2049.43s]  sure what is happening, but you're dying and all your dreams are gone. The man stops dragging you
[2049.43s -> 2057.10s]  and shouts something in another language. Suddenly a woman appears out of the crowd.
[2057.10s -> 2070.94s]  Please help me. I am dying. You say, please help me. I'm dying. She turns and leaves.
[2070.94s -> 2096.30s]  You're left there to die. In the end. How do I spell? Resurrect as a phoenix. You resurrect
[2096.30s -> 2112.07s]  as a phoenix. You become a phoenix and spread your glorious ashes to the wind. Who dares not? Who
[2112.39s -> 2123.58s]  dares not? How do you talk like in fucking old tongue? Who dares not give aid to thou in need?
[2123.58s -> 2139.32s]  You say, who dares not? Hold on. Let me get this. Hey, I got this now. I might as well use it.
[2139.32s -> 2146.86s]  Who dares not give aid to thou in need? There is no answer. You feel a great sense of loss.
[2146.86s -> 2151.18s]  You've lost all of your powers as well as your ability to fly. You are now immortal again,
[2151.18s -> 2168.23s]  although with a lot less pain. Oh man, that's not good. Okay. Uh, ask where? Say, where am I?
[2168.23s -> 2178.74s]  I want to know what the village is. You say, where am I? You stand on a beach. There's no
[2178.74s -> 2182.50s]  one in sight. Suddenly you feel a cold wind blowing. You look up to see a storm storm.
[2182.50s -> 2195.46s]  Go surfing. Go surfing. You walk out into the waves. They are gentle at first, but soon they
[2195.46s -> 2204.46s]  become much bigger than you could have imagined. Suddenly a large wave smashes you into the sand.
[2204.46s -> 2215.10s]  Grab my board and ride the waves. Next quest. Find a magical spell book called the Book of
[2215.10s -> 2223.24s]  Essence. You grab your board and ride the waves. You stand up and ride the next wave. You ride it
[2223.24s -> 2236.26s]  all the way to the shore. It was one of the best rides ever. Now see, go to the nearby
[2236.98s -> 2253.13s]  tourist trap themed bar. You go to the nearby tourist trap themed bar. You walk into the bar
[2253.13s -> 2258.55s]  and see that is filled with tourists. Right. You order a drink and you notice there's no bartender.
[2258.55s -> 2271.70s]  There are several round tables in the bar, each with its own bartender. Okay. Walk to bartender
[2272.50s -> 2287.88s]  and present annoying coupon. You walk up to the bartender and present an annoying coupon.
[2287.88s -> 2292.36s]  The bartender looks at you like you're an idiot. You explain that the drink is on the house.
[2293.08s -> 2299.26s]  He says that only happens if you buy a round of drinks for the entire table.
[2299.26s -> 2309.48s]  Buy a round of drinks for the entire table. Now I'm going to get my free drink.
[2310.04s -> 2321.75s]  You walk up to the bartender and give him your drink coupon. Okay. Buy a round for everybody.
[2324.25s -> 2332.54s]  Wait, no. No, that's my free drink. What do I want? Oh, okay. Let's be really annoying. Say,
[2334.92s -> 2361.82s]  I want a vodka drink, but don't feel like vodka. Do you have anything fruity without gin? You say,
[2361.82s -> 2365.10s]  I want a vodka drink, but I don't really feel like vodka. Do you have anything fruity that doesn't
[2365.10s -> 2370.54s]  have any gin in it? Bartender pours you a drink and says, here's your drink. But don't you dare
[2370.54s -> 2383.82s]  tell anyone that this is on the house. You sit down at a table. Yell out. Yell. I got this drink.
[2383.82s -> 2397.62s]  Say, scream. I got this drink for free. Scream. Free drink. Free drink. I got this drink for free.
[2397.62s -> 2415.08s]  You say, free drink, free drink. I got this drink for free. The bartender grabs you and says,
[2415.08s -> 2426.23s]  you can't just give this away for free. Where do you come from? I come from, I don't know,
[2426.23s -> 2446.98s]  New York City, Boston. Like a large tourist group. I come from, it's got to be from the city,
[2446.98s -> 2461.82s]  like Los Angeles. You know what I mean? You say, I come from Los Angeles. He shakes his head and
[2461.82s -> 2473.94s]  he walks away. You get a tap on the shoulder and turn around. It's the bartender. Okay, hold on.
[2475.86s -> 2487.98s]  Look behind me. Nothing personal. You look behind you. There's a big guy behind you. He looks angry.
[2487.98s -> 2491.42s]  He walks towards you and grabs you by the shirt collar and stares into your eyes.
[2494.18s -> 2514.12s]  Where the hell did you get this drink from for free? From the bartender. Smash drink on his head.
[2515.56s -> 2521.06s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to befriend this guy. Put all the blame on the bartender.
[2521.06s -> 2536.38s]  I got it from the bartender for free. I got it from the bartender. I got it from the bartender.
[2536.38s -> 2540.46s]  He stares at you and doesn't reply. He keeps on walking. You feel very scared and start trembling.
[2540.46s -> 2557.34s]  He continues walking towards the exit. Say, don't let the door hit you. He turns around,
[2557.34s -> 2562.94s]  looks at you and laughs. He begins to let go of the door, but then it slams into you and throws
[2562.94s -> 2572.71s]  you on the ground. Ow, my shoulder. Wait, was I behind him? Was I walking out with him? Did that
[2572.71s -> 2577.51s]  thing just happen where somebody holds the door for you and it's a heavy door and you don't realize
[2577.51s -> 2583.67s]  it and they let go right when you get kind of too close and the door fucking crutches you and you're
[2583.67s -> 2592.47s]  like, oh, fuck. That happens all the time to me. It almost breaks your hand and you try to pretend
[2592.47s -> 2602.01s]  like it doesn't hurt. You're like, oh, ow. Oh, thanks, man. Oh, ow, my shoulder. Okay, how about
[2606.36s -> 2619.77s]  it throws you into the ground? Say, be more careful. You say, be more careful. The door
[2619.77s -> 2623.13s]  closes and the angry man disappears. You stand up and see that you're in a kitchen.
[2624.09s -> 2628.17s]  You walk around and notice that there are several exit doors all leading into other rooms in the
[2628.17s -> 2651.56s]  house. Find the bartender. Find the bartender. Shit. You find the bartender. You walk into a
[2651.56s -> 2656.68s]  room with a big man in it. You try to speak, but he grabs you by the shirt collar. Who the hell are
[2656.68s -> 2677.58s]  you? I'm the boss. Get your hands off me. He doesn't respond. He just continues to stare at you. You
[2677.58s -> 2683.03s]  notice there are several people watching you from the corners of your eyes. Let me go. You're hurting
[2683.03s -> 2701.00s]  me. All right, fuck it. Grab him by the shirt like he's doing to me. You grab him by the shirt. You
[2701.00s -> 2704.92s]  pull him closer to you and he pushes you away and runs away. You don't chase him. You turn around to
[2704.92s -> 2720.90s]  the kitchen. Chase him. No, I ain't going to get like beat up four times. You chase him. You look
[2720.90s -> 2724.90s]  behind the kitchen and see that he's gone. You walk back to the living room. You continue looking
[2724.90s -> 2734.82s]  for him, but he's gone. Suddenly you feel your phone vibrating in your pocket. All right, answer
[2734.82s -> 2745.58s]  the phone or add some story in where I see him hiding behind the couch. Tell him to answer the
[2745.58s -> 2766.58s]  phone. Hand the phone to the man and have him answer it. Hand the phone to the man. Have
[2768.58s -> 2784.60s]  him answer it. He's gone. Find the man and have him answer the phone. You find the man and have
[2784.60s -> 2789.93s]  him answer the phone. You look for the man, but you don't see him. Suddenly your phone stops
[2789.93s -> 2794.49s]  vibrating. You wonder where he is. Then you get a notification. Someone just messaged you.
[2798.71s -> 2809.19s]  Look at the message. You look at the message. The message from a girl. She says that she saw
[2809.19s -> 2817.34s]  your video. She also says that the video went viral and you have over 300,000 views in one hour.
[2830.55s -> 2848.84s]  It replied. Reply to the girl. Let's see what it does. Block her. You send a message back to
[2848.84s -> 2853.16s]  the girl. You receive another message. Hey, do you know who this is? You reply to the message and
[2853.16s -> 2875.03s]  ask who it is. You say new phone. Who is this? You get a message back. Hey, it's me, Kate. Oh,
[2875.03s -> 2884.33s]  hey, Kate. I remember you from last year. Remember? That's how you know you don't remember this person
[2891.42s -> 2904.62s]  from last year. Okay. You get it. Hey, it's me, Kate. Oh, hey, Kate. Say, do you remember last year?
[2905.58s -> 2917.94s]  Yeah, it's me. I remember you too. All right. So who's going to crack to have both of us know we
[2917.94s -> 2923.67s]  both don't know who either one of us is. Remember me from last year? Yeah, I remember you too from
[2923.67s -> 2929.34s]  last year. Hey, it's me, Kate. Hey, it's me, Jeremy. Yeah, I know you. I know you too. When are we
[2929.34s -> 2943.00s]  going to get specific and find out who the liar is? Okay. How do you know me? I saw you when you
[2943.00s -> 2948.65s]  were coming out of the bank last year. You ran into me and broke my iPhone 5. Oh yes, I remember
[2948.65s -> 2957.26s]  now. That's how we're friends. Coming out of the bank, I bump into you and you drop your iPhone
[2957.26s -> 2970.71s]  in the shadows on the ground. Oh, sorry. Hey, you want to be friends? Say, it was a blessing.
[2971.88s -> 2992.25s]  The iPhone 5 sucks. I hope you got a new phone since then. You say it was a blessing. The iPhone
[2992.25s -> 2997.69s]  5 sucks. I hope you got a new phone. No, I still have the same phone. You stop talking. There's no
[2997.69s -> 3012.79s]  response for a while. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay. So here's what happened. So I
[3012.79s -> 3017.99s]  didn't reply because all right, I'm kind of done with this conversation. I don't really care that
[3017.99s -> 3029.38s]  much about this. And I got the, are you still there? How much time passed? Like, shit, if I don't say
[3029.38s -> 3033.78s]  yes, I'm still here, then I'm an asshole, right? I'm that like, I want a dick. You're not going to
[3033.78s -> 3046.44s]  reply. Um, yeah, I'm here. And now I've committed to the conversation. How are your 15 kids? I don't
[3046.44s -> 3057.61s]  know. Like, what do you even talk about? You say, how are you 15 kids? They're fine. You? Oh, it's
[3057.61s -> 3066.49s]  the hardest job I've ever had. Right. You don't respond for a while. So do you know what the
[3066.49s -> 3076.55s]  nearest hospital is? Who is saying that though? Am I saying that to her or is she saying that to me?
[3078.28s -> 3087.48s]  I think that's her saying that to me. Is this the 16th kid? Is this for the 16th kid?
[3094.10s -> 3100.18s]  You say, is this for the 16th kid? Ha, yeah. There's a long pause and you can hear her
[3101.22s -> 3123.56s]  breathing. I need to go. I love you. You don't respond. Oh my goodness. Oh, wait a second. Wait
[3123.56s -> 3138.01s]  a second. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on folks. From last year, we, what do you mean from? Wait, wait,
[3138.01s -> 3145.32s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You've your phone rings and I, I stopped. I didn't
[3145.32s -> 3150.57s]  answer it. I wanted somebody else to answer the phone for me. You look at a message and it was,
[3150.57s -> 3156.17s]  it's from a girl says, I saw your video. You remember me? Yeah. I remember you. I think from
[3156.17s -> 3167.56s]  last year. Yeah. Do you remember last year? Yeah. I remember. Oh boy. I, this is not good. Um,
[3170.26s -> 3196.97s]  what the fuck? This is, it's my kid. How you don't, we don't know that. You say, am I the father?
[3196.97s -> 3203.56s]  There's another long pause before she responds. Yeah. You're the father. I can't be with you.
[3203.56s -> 3229.72s]  There's a third pause before you respond. I, I'm not just going to hang up. That's fucked up.
[3230.52s -> 3248.86s]  Their names be Gary? No. Can their name be fruit snacks?
[3250.38s -> 3264.66s]  Can their name be fruit snacks? What? Their name can be fruit snacks. I don't know if that's allowed.
[3266.01s -> 3288.09s]  Fine. This is not fine. Uh, I can't wait to see little fruit snacks.
[3299.34s -> 3305.42s]  You say, I can't wait to see little fruit snacks. I love you. There's a pause.
[3306.22s -> 3312.38s]  I, you send the message and put your phone down. A few minutes later, you get a message. It's from
[3312.38s -> 3328.34s]  her. Hello. You say, hello, I'm pregnant. You don't respond. It's with twins. We need to meet up.
[3329.30s -> 3355.50s]  You don't respond. And the other one would be named fruit snacks too. There's a pause. Fine.
[3358.14s -> 3361.98s]  You stand up and walk out the door. The woman walks in as you're getting in your car.
[3361.98s -> 3376.34s]  Thanks for doing that. It means a lot. Okay. Go meet, go meet, go meet her or go meet,
[3377.54s -> 3394.18s]  go meet my pregnant girlfriend. What, what should I write? Go meet Kate. You go meet Kate. You walk
[3394.18s -> 3398.18s]  into the cafe. Hey, you're here. I was waiting for you. Yeah. I got your message. What's this about?
[3399.06s -> 3416.34s]  I press enter, right? You need help? Yeah. It's a pretty big deal. It involves you and some of your
[3416.34s -> 3453.38s]  friends. Where are the kids? I'm a wizard. Say, where are the kids? They're over there. You nod
[3453.38s -> 3457.62s]  your head and head to your friends. You walk into the cafe and see a group of kids sitting in a
[3457.62s -> 3464.92s]  corner. They look alike, but you can tell they're different people. Wait, what do you mean they look?
[3472.70s -> 3484.14s]  Wait, what? Wait, these kids are my friends? Wait, I don't understand what's happening.
[3487.11s -> 3500.63s]  What do you mean they all, they look alike, different people? What? Hi kids. What's going on?
[3501.19s -> 3514.70s]  You say, hi kids. They turn to look at you. Hey, we're waiting for Kate.
[3515.58s -> 3525.62s]  No, I didn't wait for Kate to arrive. You're the one that took my picture, right? But who,
[3525.62s -> 3543.35s]  who's saying, who's telling me this? Say, no, I, I know I, I did not take up any, no, I didn't.
[3543.43s -> 3551.93s]  Just no. I didn't take a picture of Kate. They know. Yeah, I am. I'm going to help you,
[3551.93s -> 3560.58s]  but I need you to do something for me. What? Never talk to or contact me ever again. Can you
[3560.58s -> 3574.02s]  do that? Yeah, of course. Good. Now say hi to the kids. Wait, hold on. All 15, 16 of these kids,
[3574.02s -> 3594.39s]  my kids, and they're my friends. Oh, um, okay. Never talk to me. Can I do that? Yeah. Okay. Go
[3594.39s -> 3608.62s]  say hi to the kids. Go to the kids. Go over to the kids and what? Say hello. You walk over to the
[3608.62s -> 3623.37s]  kids and give a little wave. Hi kids. Hi. Make sure you, I don't know. What, what should I say?
[3623.37s -> 3635.38s]  Make sure you try to do good in school and do good in school. I don't know. This is making me like
[3635.38s -> 3645.99s]  sad. One more thing. Make sure you do good in school. Okay. One more thing. Don't tell your
[3645.99s -> 3651.02s]  parents about any of this. If you do, I can't help you. Oh, great. That's all. Don't tell,
[3651.90s -> 3665.98s]  it's me. Don't tell your parents that you're going to do good in school. Go back to Kate.
[3665.98s -> 3678.44s]  You walk over to Kate who's already sitting down. So, oh, there she is. The man gets up and the two
[3678.44s -> 3693.16s]  of you head out the door. Who is this? You say, who is this? She's a good friend. Just don't expect
[3693.16s -> 3710.17s]  her to be your typical escort. Wait, you shake your head and continue walking. How much is it
[3710.17s -> 3726.71s]  going to cost? Wait, just fucking sprint out of the bar. You sprint out of the bar and run down
[3726.71s -> 3731.19s]  the street. Settle down there. You skid to a halt and find yourself in front of the police station.
[3745.21s -> 3761.78s]  Sit on the sidewalk. You slump against the building and fall into the sidewalk. You sit and think
[3761.78s -> 3764.58s]  about what to do. Suddenly your phone rings. You pull it out of your pocket and see that it's
[3764.58s -> 3781.61s]  Claire's number. Oh no. Answer the phone. Hey, it's me. Claire, is everything okay? Did something
[3781.61s -> 3800.89s]  happen? Man, everything's fine. I just want to see how you are. I'm fine, thanks. I'm just having
[3800.89s -> 3825.48s]  lunch with some friends. It looks like I might be here a while. Are you doing? You say, how are you
[3825.48s -> 3828.52s]  doing? I'm fine. Just wanted to see how you're doing. Do you want me to meet up later? That'd
[3828.52s -> 3855.72s]  be good. Okay. Yeah, I have magical powers. Eat the phone. Eat the phone. You eat the phone. You
[3855.72s -> 3870.26s]  put the phone back in your pocket and go eat your food. Okay, go to Claire's. Am I just in like these
[3870.26s -> 3877.58s]  big magician rogues with a magician's hat on? Like a wizard hat? Weren't we supposed to be in like
[3877.58s -> 3888.70s]  medieval times? What's going on? You go to Claire's. You get in your car and you drive over to Claire's
[3888.70s -> 3892.86s]  house. You pull into the driveway and kill the engine. You sit there in the silence for a moment
[3892.86s -> 3904.55s]  before grabbing the package of cigarettes and pulling one out. Smoke all the cigarettes.
[3904.55s -> 3917.10s]  Smoke all of them at one time. Smoke all of them at once. You pull out your lighter and light the
[3917.10s -> 3920.38s]  cigarette. As you take your first drag, you notice a man watching you. He's average height and weight
[3920.38s -> 3940.01s]  and he's wearing a dark blue shirt. Roll down the window. You roll down the window. You stick
[3940.01s -> 3942.81s]  your head out the window and motion the man to come over. He nods and walks over.
[3943.37s -> 3955.40s]  What can I do for you, sir? I'm looking for Claire. I'm here to see her. Who are you? I'm her boyfriend.
[3956.33s -> 3960.17s]  Well, you can't just show up at my house like this. Can I see some identification?
[3961.13s -> 3985.99s]  Okay, show him my Chuck E. Cheese membership card. Show him my Chuck E. Cheese Platinum
[3988.28s -> 3999.53s]  membership card. You show him your Chuck E. Cheese Platinum membership card. He looks at you and
[3999.53s -> 4005.10s]  turns it over. I see you're a member of Platinum, but I don't see that you have any other special
[4005.10s -> 4036.78s]  privileges. I have the only card. Show him my Dave and Buster's membership card. You show him
[4036.78s -> 4040.46s]  your Dave and Buster's membership card. He looks at it and turns it over. I see that you're a
[4040.46s -> 4048.70s]  member of Dave and Buster's, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges. Show him
[4049.50s -> 4069.61s]  my VIP. My VIP Costco card. My VIP Costco card. My VIP Blockbuster card.
[4080.23s -> 4095.30s]  No, no, no, no, no. Show him my... Yeah. You show him your VIP Blockbuster card. I see you're a
[4095.30s -> 4100.26s]  member of the VIP Blockbuster card, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[4100.26s -> 4134.57s]  They don't matter. Show him my American Express Metal Millionaire card. Let me see. I see that
[4134.57s -> 4138.97s]  you're a member of the American Express Metal Millionaire. I don't see that you have any other
[4138.97s -> 4154.47s]  special privilege. Show him my voting license. I see you're a member of the voting license,
[4154.47s -> 4176.46s]  but I know you're not. This doesn't matter to me. God damn it, man. Okay. I see you're a member of
[4176.46s -> 4181.34s]  the 3% back rewards, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.
[4186.82s -> 4195.72s]  I didn't even say that. Show him my special privileges. No, show him my skeleton key.
[4196.28s -> 4206.18s]  I see you're a member of the Access card, but I don't see that you have any other special...
[4209.08s -> 4212.76s]  I'm just gonna write... I'm gonna write on a piece of paper, special privileges,
[4212.76s -> 4240.14s]  and then hand it to him. There. You hand him a handmade ripped note stating special privileges.
[4240.94s -> 4247.90s]  He looks at the ripped note and then back at you. Hmm. I see. Well, I suppose I can see you
[4247.90s -> 4258.23s]  if you're willing to wait around for a bit. Follow me. Thank you. Jesus. The man leads you
[4258.23s -> 4261.67s]  through a foyer into a living room. There's a leather chair and a table in the middle of
[4261.67s -> 4285.64s]  the room with a beautiful vase on the table. Turned vase upside down. Or... Wait. You turn the vase
[4285.64s -> 4290.12s]  upside down. The vase shatters to pieces as you hear a click from the end table next to the
[4290.12s -> 4298.30s]  leather chair. You see a pistol with a silencer on it. What? Grab the gun. I found the secret
[4298.30s -> 4305.86s]  hidden like gun compartment. You grab the gun, hold it in your hand, and point it at the man.
[4305.86s -> 4316.65s]  Who the hell are you? What the hell are you doing? My name is Lewis. I'm a cop. This is my apartment
[4316.65s -> 4328.55s]  and these are some of my firearms. Put the gun down. Okay. Put the gun down. Why do you have a
[4328.55s -> 4332.71s]  gun? People I work for are very organized. They're great at getting what they want and they always
[4332.71s -> 4349.08s]  get it. Why do I have to ask? What, am I in school? Can I use the bathroom? Sure. It's just down the
[4349.08s -> 4353.66s]  hall and to the left. You walk into the hallway and look at your reflection in the mirror. You
[4353.74s -> 4370.71s]  are a skinny kid with no facial hair or muscle tone. Wait, why am I a skinny kid? Oh, fuck,
[4370.71s -> 4375.98s]  this still says I'm playing the other game, doesn't it? Shit. Hold on. Wait, hunting for
[4375.98s -> 4390.66s]  treasure chests. That's real. I can stay. Okay. You flex in the mirror. You flex your bicep. You
[4390.66s -> 4402.95s]  notice the gun in your hands. We need to talk about what the gun is talking to me. Put it down.
[4407.96s -> 4410.92s]  You put it down. It's sort of private. I'm sure it is, but the more people who know what's going
[4410.92s -> 4414.60s]  on, the safer it is. It's not that big of a deal. Why is the gun talking to me?
[4416.98s -> 4425.74s]  Shoot the mirror. You fire the gun and the mirror shatters. You stare at your reflection
[4425.74s -> 4428.46s]  and then go into the bathroom. You stare at yourself in the mirror for a while. What are you
[4428.46s -> 4440.89s]  doing in there? What the heck? What are you doing in there? Shoot in the toilet.
[4448.30s -> 4455.66s]  You put the gun under the toilet and pull the trigger. What? Like in the toilet bowl in the
[4455.66s -> 4482.47s]  water? What was that? It was nothing. You don't seem very convincing. Well, I'm not. You wash
[4482.47s -> 4488.95s]  your face with the toilet water and flush it. Don't do that. Why not? Because some of us can
[4488.95s -> 4508.86s]  still use a mirror. Are you crazy? What else? This has got to be more after that. You're not
[4508.86s -> 4519.21s]  going to give me anything? It's just easier. I don't care if it's easy. I like looking at
[4519.21s -> 4557.27s]  myself in the mirror. Well, you're not my type anyways. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Exit. Okay.
[4557.27s -> 4561.03s]  All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[4561.03s -> 4589.50s]  right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[4589.50s -> 4604.66s]  right. Okay. Um, I have, we've moved on. I'm in another segment in different scenario. Okay.
[4610.39s -> 4617.02s]  You leave. Get the, you raise your voice as loud as you can. What the hell is going on? We're
[4617.02s -> 4625.29s]  robbing the bank. How much do we have? About $7,000. I don't see any masks or guns. We don't need
[4625.29s -> 4631.82s]  them. Oh, why not? Because the tellers are too busy panicking to notice anything. Do we have a get out
[4631.82s -> 4638.65s]  of jail free card? No. And what the hell is the point? Because this really isn't that serious.
[4638.65s -> 4658.42s]  When you got nothing but time, I'm sure you'll explain it all. Take all the money and give it
[4659.50s -> 4676.30s]  to everyone in the store. Spending on candy. Take all the money and give it to everyone in the store.
[4676.30s -> 4687.88s]  That's a really stupid idea. Why? Because the robbers will get caught and we'll get fired.
[4687.88s -> 4706.58s]  Ask him if the joker put them up to it. Where's the joker? I've been missing a lot by not using
[4706.58s -> 4715.45s]  the dragon AI model. Is that in this website? Where's the joker? What happened? We had a small
[4715.45s -> 4720.81s]  disagreement and he left. Who is this guy? Do dragon AI. You have to pay premium for it. Oh,
[4721.53s -> 4731.11s]  the dragon model tells better stories. Cost money. Click the gear. I'll do that probably
[4731.11s -> 4740.50s]  another time. I'll buy it and we'll do it. It's worth it. We'll do it again. Is fall guys ready
[4740.50s -> 4763.88s]  to play yet? Don't tell me. Yes, it is. If it's not, there's a week free trial. Click, click,
[4763.88s -> 4772.95s]  hold on. I don't want to fucking boot apologize for this poor service stability. Rest assured
[4772.95s -> 4776.31s]  everything will be up and running very soon. In the meantime, here's a sneak peek at the new rat.
[4776.31s -> 4792.36s]  This is fake. This is not real. It's not real. It's not ready. Check other streamers fake news.
[4792.36s -> 4797.00s]  Oh, I know it's ready.
