[1.21s -> 9.53s]  Look who's back. Back again. Jerma's back. Tell all your friends and tell them to subscribe to me too.
[9.53s -> 33.08s]  Hey guys. Dad is home. It's been a while. This coffee is old. That's what you get. I'm gonna make
[33.08s -> 59.35s]  a tweet. I'll be right back. See ya. Somebody just said you can go offline at any time.
[61.94s -> 72.36s]  It's true. I don't think I would hold an audience for very long if I just turned my stream off
[72.36s -> 80.23s]  in 20 minutes. Hey, thanks for watching everybody. Yeah, I'm gone. Bye. I'll just turn it off. We've
[80.23s -> 87.16s]  been here for like 15-20 minutes or so. I do that every day. Nobody would watch this channel.
[87.16s -> 99.43s]  We wouldn't even get anything started. Okay, what are we doing? We're doing Dreams tonight.
[100.15s -> 105.53s]  This is Dreams Early Access. And those of you that know the Dreams is one of my most
[105.53s -> 116.39s]  anticipated video games of 2019. I want to play it. Please turn off the stream.
[118.17s -> 121.85s]  No, I know. Look, I know a lot. Here's the thing. I know a bunch of people say,
[122.65s -> 126.65s]  nah man, you could like paint a fence and I'd watch it. That's like the meme. That's the
[126.65s -> 134.87s]  joke, right? But imagine if I painted a fence every day. Eventually, after three or four full
[134.87s -> 142.71s]  houses in the neighborhood done, you'd start asking about something else. Ah, cool. You got
[142.71s -> 148.65s]  another painted fence in the neighborhood. That's cool. You're gonna play Devil May
[148.65s -> 156.14s]  Cry at any point? No, we're gonna do this like the next six months. Oh, um, all right, man,
[156.14s -> 165.75s]  like looking forward to it. Yeah, what if I built a birdhouse every stream? I mean, maybe
[165.75s -> 169.67s]  I would say at least 50% of people would be gone after the fifth birdhouse stream in a
[169.67s -> 176.87s]  row. All right, I haven't streamed in a while, so how do I do a tweet? Oh, like this.
[179.67s -> 194.68s]  Dreams and a couple of Zs. That sounds good to me. Zzz. That looks good. But yeah,
[194.84s -> 203.59s]  um, my time off was great. It was well spent with family. It was a great, relaxing time. It was
[203.59s -> 211.27s]  great to see everybody too. So I'm completely satisfied and I am ready to go back into the
[211.27s -> 219.32s]  virtual internet world of broadcasting. So what do you say we do that now? I'm gonna change
[219.32s -> 230.02s]  it over and here comes dreams. Let's load it. Why don't you stream with your mom? My mom
[230.02s -> 239.34s]  doesn't want to be on the screen. So again, this is dreams. This is a mix of I haven't played
[239.34s -> 244.95s]  it yet, so I can tell you maybe a little bit of a preface to this whole thing. I believe
[246.07s -> 253.38s]  that this is sort of a combination of 3D movie maker and tilt brush. That's kind of what I
[254.18s -> 259.46s]  gathered. All right, welcome intrepid creators. Before you get your hands on the creator
[259.46s -> 265.70s]  early access, we'd like to remind you of the following. Oh, we have a warning sign.
[266.89s -> 270.49s]  This is early access software. That means it's not the finished product. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[271.56s -> 277.78s]  During early access, we may modify the software without I didn't get a chance to read it.
[277.78s -> 286.71s]  What? I want to read that. I want to go back and read that. Hey, do you want to allow your
[286.71s -> 292.04s]  pro? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Do you want to allow your user profile
[292.04s -> 298.07s]  and creations to be public on the web at in dreams.me? You can change this anytime in the
[298.07s -> 304.66s]  I mean, I guess. Yeah, we believe in giving credit where it's due, but we need your
[304.66s -> 309.78s]  explicit permission to do this. Would you like us to display your online ID alongside your
[309.78s -> 316.90s]  creations in any promotional videos or live streams? Well, my online ID isn't is not
[317.86s -> 324.97s]  me. It's like a made up name. So okay, let's just say that I create something here and it's
[324.97s -> 329.13s]  like the best thing that anyone's ever seen. It's gonna be my like fucked up shitty
[329.13s -> 333.77s]  PlayStation four name. It's not gonna be me. I'm giving credit to my stage name.
[339.66s -> 348.02s]  Um, but okay, who cares though, right? Because I know I did it and you all know that I did it.
[348.02s -> 359.24s]  So if it pops up anywhere that everyone will just know that doesn't matter. No,
[359.24s -> 372.18s]  I don't want to use my goddamn name. We're gonna get the intro video. Hello. Bonjour. Hola.
[374.07s -> 379.48s]  Ciao. Hello. This took the fill in too many people. Stop spawning people. You're gonna
[379.48s -> 391.53s]  crash the fucking server. Hello. I just got a hundred dollars. I haven't even been back
[391.53s -> 402.39s]  for five minutes. Uh, thank you to German wide about ace attorney. No, I didn't. All right.
[402.39s -> 410.58s]  Let me, I need to address that. I think this is like a big tutorial coming up here. Hold on.
[411.14s -> 431.40s]  No movement, no sound, pleat emptiness. Then big band, a speck, an idea. The idea could be
[431.40s -> 441.30s]  anything. It could be, it could even be everything. No, not loud and coming. We're good.
[441.86s -> 450.78s]  Fight. Monochrome.
[458.04s -> 458.68s]  Any matter.
[462.57s -> 466.62s]  Silence. And most exciting of all.
[470.20s -> 479.10s]  Death. That's not, that's actually not exciting. Everyone can conduct this power.
[479.82s -> 488.18s]  Everyone has an imp. Imps are the tall guy. Wait, I can't, I'm not doing this anymore.
[489.70s -> 495.06s]  Teams with their energy, waiting for you to choose your very own. I have to make my own imp.
[497.96s -> 504.84s]  Choose your imp. Wait, hold on. Is this just a color? All right. Well, first of all, hold on.
[505.56s -> 508.28s]  I need to address something really important because I don't want to get flack for this
[508.28s -> 510.44s]  because people are going to be very upset with me and they're going to talk shit about
[510.44s -> 515.80s]  me on the internet forums. And I have no way to defend myself. I can only defend myself
[515.80s -> 521.21s]  when this stream is turned on. Think about that. Anyone says anything about me,
[521.21s -> 524.65s]  I have to, you have to wait till like my next live stream for me to repeat it and say,
[524.65s -> 529.13s]  and try to fight for my case. Germa lied about Ace Attorney gave a hundred dollars.
[529.77s -> 532.81s]  Thank you with a hundred bucks. That's an insane amount of money, but more importantly,
[534.25s -> 537.45s]  didn't lie about that. Told you I was going to play it off stream and decide if I wanted
[537.45s -> 539.69s]  to play it or not because I thought it was a different video game than what was initially
[539.69s -> 544.09s]  told to me by friends and family. But glad you had a great time with the family,
[544.09s -> 548.01s]  Germa. Even if you did lie, I'm happy to see you back and barely on time. Still on time.
[548.01s -> 552.30s]  That's why I have the window. Thank you. What do you think? Which TV? No,
[553.58s -> 557.58s]  what's my favorite color? Green. My favorite color is like in between here and here.
[561.16s -> 571.40s]  Probably green. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Some of you guys might not know
[571.40s -> 575.77s]  this. Maybe you do. I've been waiting for this game to come up for a fucking century.
[576.81s -> 581.85s]  Actually, that's almost hold the options button and your impulse snapped the center
[581.85s -> 590.82s]  of the screen. Okay. Yes. Great. Your imp responds to the smallest movements of your
[590.82s -> 594.90s]  wireless control. The sound of your voice. That's because it's attached to the
[594.90s -> 599.22s]  controller's motion sensor. Oh God, no. You only need to move the controller
[599.22s -> 605.38s]  a teeny tiny amount to get your imp to respond. Okay. Go on. Move your imp around
[605.38s -> 611.58s]  a bit. Think of the light bulb on the front of the controller as a flashlight beam
[611.58s -> 617.24s]  conducting your imp. I hope hopefully I can turn this off. You see that little cluster
[617.24s -> 625.85s]  of creativity. The creativity clusters. To touch it. I gotta like rest my hands down
[625.85s -> 630.41s]  on my brachial area. That's it. I don't want to drive a car. I don't know why
[630.41s -> 635.45s]  people like this. Those two clusters at the top and bottom. I don't like holding my hands
[635.45s -> 639.37s]  out like I'm driving a car. But when you drive a car, the wheel is big so you can rest
[639.37s -> 648.97s]  your forearms on it. This is like driving. Look, look, look. Motion controls are
[648.97s -> 656.25s]  cool. Motion controls are interesting. But I don't like driving a car for more
[656.25s -> 679.74s]  than four hours. I got it in one second. Watch this. Ready? I'm pretty good at it
[679.74s -> 683.10s]  though. I'm pretty good at it. Let's see if I can get like all the donuts in one swoop.
[683.10s -> 698.30s]  Ready? It's a symphony. What if this was the whole early access? See how your imp can affect
[698.30s -> 705.26s]  everything it touches. Welcome to dreams. Playing through the wilds of your imagination.
[706.06s -> 721.72s]  Easy. You're wonderful. You're a dream, sir. Play this game on iPad. Sweet. Excellent.
[721.72s -> 729.24s]  Groovy. You found the wall of doubt. Don't worry. Everyone doubts themselves in the beginning.
[730.36s -> 734.76s]  I wasn't doubting myself. I was completely confident. Try using the pointy tip of your
[734.76s -> 742.98s]  imp to grab hold of it. How do you grab? R2. That was pretty, that was pretty ingenuitive.
[746.31s -> 752.79s]  That doesn't feel bad. Look at that brick. Who does it think it is? Get rid of it.
[758.81s -> 767.91s]  Did we do it? Your idea's getting away. Chase it down. Your idea. No, not my idea.
[770.57s -> 780.18s]  Ah, shit. My idea was it was a jack in the box apparently. Is it gonna, is it a loot box?
[780.82s -> 791.46s]  No, it's not. Do I have to pay for ideas? It should be in here somewhere. The second we
[791.46s -> 798.02s]  start paying for our imaginations, that's when, that's when like the Illuminati government
[798.02s -> 811.40s]  control this one. I'm just gonna be clear about that. This is cute though. This is cute. Don't,
[811.40s -> 820.02s]  don't talk shit about this. Why did I pick green? I'm an idiot. Green is the symbol of
[820.58s -> 834.41s]  intelligence. It's the color of intelligence. The only source of energy is you. What can you
[834.41s -> 840.49s]  do? It's not the color of idiots. Go take color theory and you tell me. You can possess.
[843.11s -> 850.87s]  Yellow is like anger. Red and like passion. Red is rage. Green is intelligence. Blue is
[851.67s -> 866.01s]  calmness. Look it up. I just like smash the light bulb. Three. Dream.
[868.68s -> 875.34s]  We have light. A good start. If only we had a way of exploring this place.
[875.34s -> 882.22s]  Let's see. Oh, I get to be a new character. Now we're really getting somewhere.
[884.86s -> 892.98s]  It's the X jumps. I don't, I'm confused. Oh, I get it. I get it guys. I get it.
[893.54s -> 900.98s]  Listen to me. Listen. Quiet. Stop talking. Stop talking. Listen. So this whole thing
[900.98s -> 904.66s]  was made in dreams. Yeah. Everything you're seeing here was made in this game.
[908.74s -> 916.44s]  Okay. Yeah. Brad. Brad. You and Mike have detention later. Okay. After school. My office.
[917.00s -> 926.55s]  And assholes. There must be some way to get out there. This whole thing was made
[926.55s -> 930.95s]  in dreams. I know it says that in the lower right headquarter. I know it does.
[930.95s -> 942.18s]  So it was a springboard. You got it. Great work. We're so close. I can't wait to make
[942.26s -> 953.37s]  my own video game. Oh, look at that seedling. The dream of us loves to help things grow.
[953.37s -> 958.49s]  Cool. Okay. So circle is to interact. Well, the circle is to get out. So how do I get in
[958.49s -> 967.80s]  there? All right. I have to use my hands. And then look at how shaky I am. Those of you
[967.80s -> 971.32s]  think I'm like making this shit up. Like how fucking weird I am and how fucked up I am.
[971.32s -> 975.08s]  Like look at my hands.
[979.90s -> 996.28s]  All right. That's a rumble feature. Pretty good song though. How is he moving?
[997.40s -> 1007.38s]  Oh, I need to pretend to jump too. Do I make more music?
[1007.38s -> 1018.42s]  Here at last. Dreams. Your vast, vibrant, sublime universe of possibilities. Let's start.
[1018.42s -> 1026.62s]  You know, 2020 hindsight, I should have brought a bed in here. And right when this turned on
[1026.62s -> 1037.56s]  here, it said dreams. Let's start. I should just got into bed on camera. How long? Ah,
[1038.90s -> 1046.04s]  this is your very own home space. Home space. Okay. You'll always start dreaming from here.
[1047.00s -> 1059.54s]  Interesting. All right. So where do we go? What's this? A prize bubble.
[1062.02s -> 1070.66s]  I have to collect the prize bubble. I could find more. Okay. You've got the difficulty of a
[1070.66s -> 1076.20s]  four-year-old Easter egg hunt here. I think I'll get them all. That was a staircase.
[1080.79s -> 1097.06s]  Loot bubbles. What is that? Tic-tac-toe? How do I get that one? Of course it's got a name
[1097.06s -> 1106.34s]  like the Dreamiverse. Okay. Where is it? Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Give me one second.
[1107.46s -> 1112.18s]  Maybe I unlock a bigger jump. Like a super jump or something. Or a double jump. I don't
[1112.18s -> 1117.85s]  think I get anymore. I think those are the predetermined ones that I'm allowed to get.
[1117.85s -> 1133.69s]  All right. Main menu. Dream surfing? Okay. Dream shaping or dream surfing? Should we check
[1133.69s -> 1143.78s]  out what people have made first? Let's see what's possible. Let's do some dream surfing. I
[1143.78s -> 1146.90s]  didn't get a chance to read that. Was that a disclaimer about it being like nudity or something
[1146.90s -> 1155.80s]  or like R rated material? I didn't get to see it. Dream surfing. Here we can explore the wilds
[1155.80s -> 1162.87s]  of the Dreamiverse. Slipping and sliding through the strangest and most wonderful ideas and
[1162.87s -> 1168.07s]  creations. I can't wait. This is going to be so cool. Lose yourself in the kaleidoscope of
[1168.07s -> 1174.87s]  games, animations, music videos. You can do anything. And all sorts of worlds and experiences
[1174.87s -> 1183.13s]  made by dreamers just like you. Dream surfing is a never ending, ever changing stream of
[1183.13s -> 1189.19s]  dreamers imaginations. Let's try it out. I can't wait. I think some of you are underestimating
[1189.19s -> 1196.52s]  how cool this game possibly could be. Final version art and voiceover added to the fun.
[1196.52s -> 1203.90s]  Okay. Oh, I thought that. All right. So this is just the version 1.01. All right. Let's go.
[1204.62s -> 1210.74s]  Okay. Dreams. Auto-surf. Play through a randomly selected taster of the Dreamiverse.
[1213.69s -> 1223.56s]  Um, what are you looking for? Game? Story? Showcase? Let's just do auto-surf. Get the
[1223.56s -> 1239.38s]  fastest time possible. It's a race? What the fuck? What? I don't understand what I'm supposed
[1239.38s -> 1267.18s]  to do. This is really fast. Oh, no! It's like Super Mario Odyssey. Somebody's going to
[1267.18s -> 1275.58s]  make the entire Super Mario Odyssey in this game. Watch out. All right. I got crushed.
[1280.58s -> 1288.65s]  This is so cool. I won't make anything this cool. Shortcut. Mario Kart taught me this.
[1288.65s -> 1306.14s]  Oh, wait. Can you imagine when talented people actually play this game? What? What
[1306.14s -> 1311.70s]  I was wondering? Oh, I went right to the middle. I thought I could go in there. See,
[1311.70s -> 1318.34s]  I should be doing this like a speed run. How is that possible? That's not even possible
[1318.34s -> 1328.97s]  to do what I just did. That's not even possible. Oh, my God. I'm still trying to do it like a
[1328.97s -> 1354.02s]  speed runner. Turn on the edge. I did it. All right. That was cool. This is called Dreamiverse
[1354.02s -> 1360.18s]  Dad. I don't think that there are any created actual created things here. Thumbs up or
[1360.18s -> 1368.06s]  thumbs down? Rewind or skip? Uh, that was cute. I'll give it a thumbs up and then let's
[1368.06s -> 1381.42s]  go. Skip, right? What? Follow for update. OK, so this is a first person shooter. Aim. Shoot.
[1383.70s -> 1412.55s]  Swap weapon. Reload. Crouch. Jump. Free aim. Uh, OK. Is he dead? Why does he look alive?
[1413.67s -> 1418.65s]  I don't know. But I'm going to keep going. What's the goal?
[1419.69s -> 1436.58s]  Is somebody hurting me? What is hurting me? Oh, Jesus. It's this guy. OK, he is
[1436.58s -> 1450.38s]  homing bullets. Same game made both of these. I can't wait to make my own. I'm going to spend
[1450.38s -> 1455.06s]  six months making my own thing. Remember I made the joke about painting the fences in
[1455.06s -> 1474.01s]  the beginning of the stream? Uh, hope you're ready for a fresh coat tomorrow. He's dead?
[1474.01s -> 1496.10s]  All right, I was going to run by. This is so weird. This is so weird. I think I died.
[1496.74s -> 1504.50s]  All right, I want to see more. Watch out the gap in the door. It's a separate reality. The only
[1504.50s -> 1509.22s]  me is you. Are you sure the only you is you? What's that from? That's from something in
[1509.22s -> 1523.21s]  particular. This is P.T. Somebody remade P.T.? No, they did not. No, that was it? Hold on,
[1523.21s -> 1531.21s]  that was the end? I didn't get to do it? I didn't get to play P.T. It was just the first
[1531.21s -> 1560.57s]  door. Please hug me, this is called. This is called curiosity. Curiosity?
[1564.33s -> 1585.06s]  Uh, when everything is over, curiosity continues. Reach destination. Stay creative
[1585.06s -> 1598.55s]  and explore the unknown. Thank you Media Molecule for this game. This is fucking unbelievable.
[1605.78s -> 1616.81s]  I wonder how hard it is to use. It's a never-ending compilation of whatever anyone
[1616.81s -> 1632.65s]  wants it to be. Holy shit. I can run? Can I? I don't think I can run. I think I just have to get
[1632.65s -> 1647.08s]  there. Oops. So it's like a game engine that anyone can use. Yeah, but you don't have to make
[1647.08s -> 1653.93s]  a game. You can do anything. You can paint a picture. You can make an animation. You can make
[1653.93s -> 1659.77s]  a little cartoon. You can make a 2D cartoon. I'm pretty sure there's no limit to it
[1659.77s -> 1673.16s]  have to be a video game. I think I ran into an invisible wall. Uh, this one doesn't seem to be
[1673.16s -> 1684.15s]  done. Uh, I have to go. Wait, did I do the wrong thing? Should I have gone around another way?
[1685.11s -> 1696.36s]  Supposed to go up the mountain? Maybe. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR thanks to the five
[1696.36s -> 1704.26s]  community subs. Thank you. Appreciate it. Five more from Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Am I
[1704.26s -> 1712.68s]  gonna run into another wall here? Keep lying. It's how most of us stay subscribed.
[1713.48s -> 1720.39s]  But what happens when I get here? I gotta see the whole thing through, right?
[1721.03s -> 1725.35s]  I can't just go this far without touching the beam. I'll never be able to stay.
[1728.17s -> 1736.07s]  All right, you ready for my dramatic cry moment? I'm gonna get there and I'm gonna
[1736.07s -> 1740.47s]  power off before I touch it. I ran out of battery or something. That's what I would have
[1740.47s -> 1765.02s]  done. Made it. The journey is never completed. Ah, shit. Well, I didn't have to do that whole
[1765.02s -> 1776.47s]  thing. Well, that's the end of that one. All right, let's go loop one. Wait, why is it? Why?
[1779.58s -> 1786.84s]  Is this a different screen? We got the rope. Was that part of the same game?
[1799.40s -> 1804.04s]  This is a PT playlist and it just happens to be looping them in here.
[1807.64s -> 1814.04s]  This is fucking crazy. No way is this possible.
[1829.40s -> 1836.04s]  Kids game. I don't know if it's a kids game. It's an anything game.
[1837.51s -> 1841.35s]  The off-road lands. Chapter one. We're getting a bunch of random things. We should be getting them.
[1841.91s -> 1845.59s]  This is overwhelming how cool this is.
[1851.91s -> 1858.23s]  Oh, it's me. Well, let me get some of the letter grid because this car is... Oh my god,
[1858.23s -> 1865.05s]  I'm gonna make a car game. I can't wait to make a car game. It's coming through.
[1866.17s -> 1884.26s]  All right, somebody just flushed a toilet. I can't wait to make something.
[1884.98s -> 1887.38s]  But I don't want to jump into it yet. I'm gonna see more creation.
[1888.02s -> 1904.20s]  Uh, I went. Factor Majora's Menu. Galactic Adventures. Press X to start.
[1923.99s -> 1926.79s]  No, what's happening is it's giving me random...
[1927.99s -> 1931.51s]  There can't be that many to pull from right now because it's only gonna be a week.
[1941.03s -> 1944.47s]  His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom,
[1944.47s -> 1948.39s]  but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.
[1953.11s -> 1957.75s]  Touch that dial now. We're just getting started because here comes the off-road lands.
[1957.75s -> 1968.90s]  Chapter two. So this is chapter two. So each level has to be its own loading area.
[1976.71s -> 1979.03s]  I can't wait to see how this connects to the PT universe.
[1979.75s -> 2018.79s]  The game is way too loud. I'll fix that. Am I just rolling down the hill? What the fuck?
[2018.79s -> 2034.65s]  I don't think that was supposed to happen. How do I just get out of here? Oh, I beat it.
[2038.20s -> 2045.45s]  Space pilot dogfight is this one. Oh shit. Cockpit you take off.
[2048.79s -> 2060.65s]  What? Wow, this is unbelievable. All right, quick. Somebody make Star Fox 2.
[2065.10s -> 2077.42s]  How do I lock on? What does it lock on? What does it circle?
[2078.06s -> 2086.94s]  What does enemy lock on? Who the hell has it locked on to? I want this one.
[2086.94s -> 2118.81s]  How do I do like a flip roll? Too late. Doesn't she show up?
[2125.98s -> 2130.47s]  Don't you have to zoom in and look at stuff? I hear them calling to me from...
[2131.43s -> 2136.23s]  When his ten-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him too.
[2136.23s -> 2139.91s]  The window is cut off. His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom.
[2140.47s -> 2144.23s]  Reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.
[2144.87s -> 2148.39s]  The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range.
[2149.03s -> 2152.23s]  The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time.
[2153.43s -> 2158.47s]  Police arriving on scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car
[2158.47s -> 2162.23s]  listening to the radio. Several days before the murders...
[2162.23s -> 2163.75s]  Yeah, didn't she hang out in the corner or something?
[2163.75s -> 2166.47s]  ...repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice.
[2167.11s -> 2170.23s]  They said it was like he was chanting some strange spell.
[2171.77s -> 2173.53s]  I think somebody made the whole game here.
[2174.89s -> 2178.25s]  Hey, here we go. Let's go to the new chapter three of The Off-Road Lens.
[2178.25s -> 2186.68s]  Mine's gonna be up here. I'm gonna make like the Teflon of the Lost Ark or something.
[2187.90s -> 2206.46s]  What? Oh, okay. Giant sword. Look at this shit.
[2215.82s -> 2218.78s]  This can't be that difficult to do, though, because that was the whole purpose of this
[2218.78s -> 2230.46s]  game. They spent a decade trying to make this game completely accessible and incredibly deep
[2230.46s -> 2239.72s]  at the same time. Watch us go there. It is insanely hard to use. No, no way.
[2240.60s -> 2244.06s]  So easy. A streamer could do it. That's true.
[2246.68s -> 2248.76s]  Hammer Panic. Two-player minigame.
[2253.11s -> 2258.38s]  Hammer Panic? What is this? Okay, so you're a little hammer guy.
[2259.10s -> 2261.43s]  Didn't this look like a TV show or a cartoon?
[2264.82s -> 2267.86s]  Hit objects and your opponent's colored light bulbs to score points.
[2283.13s -> 2289.48s]  And you can jump in this, too. Hit the objects into your opponent's backboard.
[2293.58s -> 2298.54s]  Okay, so it's like a game of soccer. I can't even win with nobody fighting me.
[2299.10s -> 2308.65s]  Ah, I see. They have weight, too. The graphics are beautiful, too. The graphics are really nice.
[2311.83s -> 2323.27s]  Make your opponent fall off. Oh, I haven't played this in Minecraft.
[2323.51s -> 2329.08s]  What's this called in Minecraft? It's called, like, Quip Blower or something. What's it called?
[2332.70s -> 2353.82s]  That's Quiplash. Final results. Winner! End game. So you can make a little Mario party.
[2359.38s -> 2380.89s]  Here comes the bathroom loop. God damn it. I didn't want to play a horror game right now.
[2389.98s -> 2425.78s]  Wait, what? I'm not doing this one. No.
[2426.10s -> 2437.32s]  And final chapter of the off-road lands. Yeah, it's truly off-road. It's off the cliff.
[2437.96s -> 2459.21s]  Well, this is not a boat. This is a car. Car is still running. I'm gonna make a city.
[2460.70s -> 2485.05s]  I'm gonna make GTA 6. What is... That's pretty scary.
[2487.85s -> 2506.23s]  What is that implying? What? No fucking way! They're gonna get sued.
[2506.95s -> 2516.47s]  So many people are gonna get sued. Don't sue me, though. I didn't do it.
[2517.27s -> 2522.01s]  I'm just showcasing it. You can't get sued for, like, reporting the news, right? Like,
[2522.01s -> 2531.10s]  I'm just reporting the news. What do you mean wrong? Get the one up.
[2532.38s -> 2537.83s]  That guy hasn't played Mario 1.1 since that was, like, seven. Which one is it?
[2537.83s -> 2543.56s]  It's under here, right? Where is it? It's right here? I know it's right here somewhere.
[2544.20s -> 2559.54s]  Where is it? No, they didn't put that in here. They didn't program that in.
[2559.54s -> 2579.67s]  I can't run fast? No, it's going down. Oh, fuck. Oh, well. I'll get the...
[2582.65s -> 2593.06s]  There's gonna be... There's gonna be a one. I don't think it knows what to do.
[2596.42s -> 2607.50s]  Oh, Super Mario 1.1 was really fun. This is, like, look behind glitch.
[2632.54s -> 2645.05s]  I did. Dark Souls inspired Dark Dungeon. Inspired by Dark Souls. So this is not a game.
[2645.05s -> 2679.19s]  This is gonna be just a piece of video. I can't wait for Jeremy to die to Pinwheel later in
[2679.19s -> 2702.28s]  this game. This is called Main Menu. Press X to rock. So each screen is its own piece of
[2702.28s -> 2712.79s]  video. I want to rock so bad. Colored Notes will approach. This is Guitar Hero.
[2713.51s -> 2725.59s]  All right, let's play it. Don't touch that dial now. We're just getting started. Let's play Rock
[2725.59s -> 2735.10s]  On! What? Release the game for free and find someone who matches this... What the fuck was
[2735.10s -> 2750.06s]  that? That was a messed up loading screen. That was actually kind of scary. Is this a skateboard?
[2752.36s -> 2756.52s]  Holy shit. How do I steer it? I don't think I can steer this.
[2762.12s -> 2795.22s]  Oh god. It's too hard to stay on. I can't stay on this. Where's the camera? I don't know if I'm
[2795.22s -> 2808.42s]  still on it. Am I still on it? Yes, I still am. That was pretty cool. I need to make a
[2808.42s -> 2813.03s]  roller coaster or something. There are too many ideas flying around in my head at the same time.
[2817.46s -> 2839.67s]  Oh no. Holy shit, I actually got back on. I did it. Is there more? Is the whole level
[2839.67s -> 2849.14s]  coming down? I can't go off. I'm going off sideways. This is not how a skateboard works.
[2854.01s -> 2861.05s]  Just drifting off. Song list. I need to get out of here and do an actual play.
[2861.05s -> 2883.24s]  Newsletter blues. Taking sizable sips from the creek of anguish. Yes. A Life Took Lemons game.
[2883.24s -> 2889.88s]  Slayer scrolls. Scene 0.5. Title card. You are a slayer. You take on contracts called scrolls
[2889.88s -> 2897.08s]  to slay men or beasts in exchange for gold. You have journeyed to the quaint stonewall town.
[2897.08s -> 2902.12s]  You enter the dwarf inn. The innkeeper here is specially adept at finding the best scrolls
[2902.12s -> 2934.12s]  offering the most gold. Slayer scrolls. I want to go do that. Am I getting booed?
[2934.84s -> 2957.18s]  I forget what it is. It's not even the real game and it's still scary.
[2958.30s -> 2966.98s]  This is not even the right one. This is a pretend version and it's still just as bad.
[2966.98s -> 3007.43s]  Here we go. Slide. Is L1? Am I fucking Grover? Oh yes. I think I will take two scrolls.
[3015.51s -> 3020.62s]  Welcome to the dwarf inn, slayer. Do you have a scroll for me?
[3021.69s -> 3026.97s]  Always do, but before we get started, you should know there is an assassin here for you.
[3029.05s -> 3035.26s]  An assassin? Why did you let him in? He's got gold for ale, just like anyone else.
[3035.26s -> 3040.78s]  But a dead slayer in my inn is not good for business. I'll take care of it. Which one is
[3040.78s -> 3047.98s]  he? He's the fat one, hard to miss the lad. Remember slayer, no weapons in my inn. And keep
[3047.98s -> 3057.21s]  it quiet. A bar fighter's not good for business. I know I did mention the word Grover. That's the
[3057.21s -> 3063.34s]  guy that Grover always pisses off. That's the guy that goes to all of Grover's restaurants
[3064.06s -> 3070.57s]  and he fucks up his order every time. No, I wanted to have a slice of pizza. It's that guy.
[3072.14s -> 3081.51s]  No, I wanted, I didn't want spaghetti and meatballs. I wanted a pizza. Oh, I'm so sorry.
[3082.39s -> 3091.88s]  Where's the fat one? Oh, that guy, that's the fat one I think.
[3097.05s -> 3106.26s]  Is the guy fat or is he just a pear? Fill the assassin's drink with something deadly.
[3111.42s -> 3116.62s]  Another prompt. Dead? What is it saying? I can't read that.
[3125.08s -> 3136.98s]  Fill the, does it say dead? Why would they have a bucket of poison in here? Dip in sludge.
[3137.70s -> 3151.22s]  Here you go. Wait, there's two fat guys. No, it's not. Okay, here he is. Here you go.
[3166.90s -> 3185.58s]  He's asleep. Okay, I did it, right? Do I win? Quick work, slayer. That was no assassin.
[3185.58s -> 3191.10s]  What scroll do you have for me? This scroll comes from the Lord of Frostburg. A dragon
[3191.10s -> 3197.42s]  plagues the northern mountains. The Lord's knights have burned, have burned alive by
[3197.42s -> 3203.51s]  its fiery breath. Slay the dragon, bring the dragon's tooth. I can't wait to do that
[3205.02s -> 3227.83s]  after we get jumpscared again by PT. I think I just leave. Leave Dwarf Inn. Oh, god damn it.
[3247.59s -> 3262.63s]  Thank god we got the slayer scrolls seen too. This is actually really, really cool looking.
[3266.34s -> 3273.14s]  I think they had to sculpt these people too. So I have to go fight the dragon?
[3273.78s -> 3287.61s]  Is there a sprint? Yeah, right here. Giant snowman. I don't have a sword, though. Swing
[3287.61s -> 3298.25s]  sword. I don't have one. I can't wait for the 3D undertale to be made in this, you know what
[3298.25s -> 3312.46s]  I'm saying? Let's go out the door. It already exists? You gotta be kidding me. I think there
[3312.46s -> 3326.49s]  already is one. Well, great. Will they let me out? Where do I get one of those?
[3327.45s -> 3381.58s]  Oh, no. I should get this one. This one should be pretty easy. Fuck! How does one even make this
[3381.58s -> 3410.10s]  in this game, though? What do I want to make? We're gonna go with like three or four dog shit
[3410.10s -> 3414.82s]  things, and then I'm gonna get the real idea that I'm gonna spend the next six months on.
[3423.58s -> 3428.28s]  Make the Grover pizza thing. You want to make the scene from Sesame Street
[3428.92s -> 3432.44s]  where Grover fucks up the Muppet's food. That's what you want me to do.
[3433.40s -> 3458.76s]  You want me to spend at least three to four streams on this. Do it. But without the voices,
[3458.76s -> 3470.98s]  it doesn't make- I have to do text. I'm gonna have to get a transcript of that scene from
[3470.98s -> 3490.90s]  Sesame Street. This is a long song. How long does this last? 100,000 points. One, two,
[3490.90s -> 3497.58s]  three, four, five stars. Oh, that's all right. That's a restaurant worth going to on Yelp.
[3497.66s -> 3503.19s]  Yelp is fucking tough. It's really hard. How many times do I have to keep doing this one?
[3503.83s -> 3508.47s]  Did I not do the completion thing to do- to not have to do this one?
[3509.35s -> 3517.02s]  I think this is where the- whoever's making this, I think this is where they left off.
[3524.92s -> 3530.42s]  Slayer Scrolls scene 2.5. After days of journey, you arrive at the northern mountains.
[3530.42s -> 3534.50s]  As you climb the mountain, you reach a clearing. A dwarf waits here,
[3534.50s -> 3541.75s]  a axe in his hand, and a slain man below him. I don't want to do any more of these songs.
[3551.34s -> 3562.79s]  Okay, listen up, and don't you move. Need to take a piss? Hold it. I've got just 60 seconds
[3562.79s -> 3569.64s]  to go. I gotta mess all you folks out there in radio land. So sit tight and bend an ear.
[3569.64s -> 3575.40s]  Now's the time for action. Our society is rotten to the core. I'm talking to all the fine
[3575.48s -> 3580.04s]  upstanding folks got their wet hair cut. Southern jobs pulled out from under us.
[3581.08s -> 3584.92s]  Yeah, you. You know what to do. Now's the time. Do it.
[3587.40s -> 3588.68s]  Imagine what we actually got for this game.
[3596.86s -> 3611.06s]  There we go. Wait, is that- that's my sword? My sword is very clearly a leg.
[3611.06s -> 3618.23s]  I just do a sidewards kick.
[3650.52s -> 3657.00s]  Here it all started when I was nine. Lost my parents in a mining accident. Growing up on
[3657.00s -> 3662.20s]  the streets of Dwarf Hold made me an angry man and a deadly one. Well, thanks for listening
[3662.20s -> 3669.91s]  to this dwarf's tale. Go on your way now and let me ponder my ways. What did I get? Why
[3669.91s -> 3715.74s]  am I red now? You're dead? Let's go. Fight the dragon. No. I gotta make something fucking
[3715.74s -> 3743.35s]  wild. Skip it? No, I can't skip it yet. Oh god. Wait. What? Wait, it didn't even give me a chance.
[3766.33s -> 3772.34s]  Oh god damn it. Do I have to actually do something here? Is it with the clock?
[3778.50s -> 3786.04s]  Hello. Yeah, R3 doesn't zoom in anymore.
[3798.30s -> 3819.99s]  Don't. Don't press X. I think I did it. No, I didn't. What other shit do I have to press?
[3820.79s -> 3832.02s]  Don't you have to find like photos? Yeah, I'm-
[3850.63s -> 3856.55s]  Shot once in the chest from point blank range. The mother who he shot in the stomach was pregnant
[3856.55s -> 3862.86s]  at the time. Police arriving on scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car
[3863.42s -> 3868.22s]  listening to the radio. Several days before the murders, neighbors say they heard the
[3868.22s -> 3873.90s]  father repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice. They said it was like he was chanting
[3873.90s -> 3888.23s]  some strange spell. You reach a valley on the mountainside, the smell of smoke and ash fills
[3888.23s -> 3894.36s]  your lungs. The presence of fire would be comfort for your cold hands if it did not signal that
[3894.36s -> 3900.30s]  a dragon is stirring. Piercing screech of a dragon causes you to slip off a cliff and
[3900.30s -> 3918.17s]  drop your sword. What the fuck? Boy, what you looking at is the name of this. Oh,
[3918.57s -> 3929.05s]  it's the gyro to lean. This is stupid.
[3937.21s -> 3940.98s]  The following is an early visual concept created on Dreams.
[3946.50s -> 3956.62s]  Metro. Cinematic camera. Real-time footage running on the bubble bath engine.
[3957.66s -> 3971.93s]  That's what this is called. Bubble bath engine. I don't think there's anything else here.
[3971.93s -> 3980.23s]  I think it's just a little concept. Follow more. Follow for more content. I'm not following
[3980.23s -> 3986.90s]  anybody. I cannot move. This is just a static representation of what they're developing at
[3986.90s -> 4004.70s]  the moment. Boy, you. What you looking at? What you looking at? All right. Well, that's cool.
[4009.50s -> 4016.79s]  Here we go. Dragon boss fight. This is the holy shit. Oh my God. I can't wait.
[4017.51s -> 4030.60s]  This is the ending of Slayer Scrolls. You know when you're watching TV on the couch
[4031.32s -> 4034.36s]  and there's three or four shows on at the same time that you want to watch?
[4035.24s -> 4038.54s]  This is just channel surfing back and forth between those channels.
[4039.26s -> 4042.82s]  It's like, oh, I really want to see who gets chopped next, but I also want to see what happens
[4042.82s -> 4052.41s]  to Garfield. This goes to commercial and you change to the other show. What down to the
[4052.49s -> 4070.76s]  Patriots right now? Let's go find out. What was that? Take apple. Oh, he's going to burn
[4070.76s -> 4092.04s]  the forest down. What do I do? How do I kill him? I only have a sword. He's got a thousand health.
[4107.77s -> 4119.42s]  I got him. Where are you going? What am I going? What is he doing?
[4126.23s -> 4129.35s]  I got it. Take the dragon tooth. I completed the game.
[4138.07s -> 4149.69s]  Ah, this is the... Are you kidding me? Look at this sculpting job. This is so cool.
[4150.49s -> 4186.09s]  This really is a dream version of this level. Anything else I can do? Can I open any doors? I
[4186.09s -> 4194.02s]  think these are all different ways to go and we'll do a new screen. Book of the dragon.
[4199.80s -> 4233.69s]  Dude, this is so cool. What needs to be connected here? Alba blue.
[4233.69s -> 4266.34s]  That's it, right? No, something's wrong there. I can't read this. What does it say?
[4267.62s -> 4276.65s]  You've carried the dragon's tooth and made... Was that part of the book of dragons?
[4277.45s -> 4283.43s]  When you arrive the gates don't open for you like usual. Guards come outside to confront you.
[4284.07s -> 4298.97s]  They don't look too pleased to see you. The portal demo? Face direction of portal.
[4299.61s -> 4302.97s]  Maintain current direction. Uncap velocity. Cap velocity.
[4311.90s -> 4329.05s]  Is it supposed to be a portal gun? Oh, okay. R1. So it works. It technically works.
[4335.27s -> 4351.29s]  It's these little pancakes. Okay, so let's go like this. I'm not sure there is a win
[4351.29s -> 4374.38s]  condition here. It looks like a test. Do a loop. All right, I'll do a loop. No, no,
[4374.46s -> 4390.46s]  get in there. Oh wait, I can do it. Right, it's portal. You can just do a loop like this.
[4399.75s -> 4413.05s]  Wait, what? Can I now do a loop? Yeah, I can't do it on the ceiling. I'm trying just to fall
[4413.05s -> 4442.02s]  through. No, I... Oh, oh. I'm not sure this is gonna work. That's enough of that.
[4442.02s -> 4462.74s]  PlayStation Home Studio. Side table? Sit. Didn't they turn PlayStation Home off
[4462.74s -> 4477.48s]  completely forever? This is cool. You can just make this. Oh, you can actually move
[4477.48s -> 4486.98s]  things around. Interesting. I feel like you can make your own little apartment. Cool.
[4486.98s -> 4491.22s]  All right, we'll do a few... finish Slayer Scrolls.
[4491.22s -> 4495.58s]  You're no longer allowed inside Stonewall Town. What foolishness is this? I've been
[4495.58s -> 4500.62s]  traveling to Stonewall for ages. A fortnight ago, a slayer burned Icevale Village to the
[4500.62s -> 4506.14s]  ground. Every man, woman, and child was slain. Slayers are no longer allowed in Stonewall.
[4511.74s -> 4515.26s]  Stonewall is a beautiful village. I would never bring harm to it. I'm not a slayer.
[4515.34s -> 4522.50s]  You can't judge me on the actions of others. You are right. You have done good by this town
[4522.50s -> 4533.80s]  in the past. I will let you in, but make it quick. I think every option worked. Cuphead.
[4535.13s -> 4553.35s]  Dreams Edition. What? Are you serious? How do I shoot? Get... press while moving to get going.
[4553.35s -> 4561.05s]  Hold L2 to focus in and use R2 to give him hell. Press L3 to pop a squat for
[4561.05s -> 4602.36s]  the blueberries. What does that mean? Kill it! Kill them! It takes a lot of hits. Die!
[4606.07s -> 4626.17s]  All right, I need to get the coins. You can dash. You can jump and dash, right? Anybody else?
[4635.75s -> 4648.82s]  Oh, it's the tutorial level. Die! There's too many hits! I'm shooting them a million
[4648.82s -> 4679.85s]  times! All right, where's the end? I see a heart over there. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4679.85s -> 4687.70s]  Oh, there it is. He's too short. I can't hit him. Oh, this is bad.
[4697.37s -> 4705.86s]  Oh, shit. Too many. Pop the squat. Yeah, that's right.
[4708.18s -> 4714.46s]  Do I have to collect all the coins? Oh, did you actually just hit me?
[4715.42s -> 4731.37s]  All right, I don't know if there's an end. This is really, really cool though.
[4732.97s -> 4737.42s]  I think I might have to just collect everything. That's awesome. You know,
[4737.42s -> 4744.89s]  get that one a thumbs up. They didn't make Cuphead. This is called the encounter.
[4746.28s -> 4748.76s]  Disclaim it. The following level is a demo for an upcoming project planned for
[4748.76s -> 4751.32s]  production after the release of Dreams. Currently being worked on so you might
[4751.32s -> 4772.31s]  experience minor bugs or glitches. Enjoy. Okay. Bigsurf77 presents chapter one, The
[4772.31s -> 4803.72s]  Encounter. That looks like a space station base of some sort, right? Guns or anything?
[4803.72s -> 4813.93s]  I don't think so. Oh, there you are. Yeah, I think it's time to finally leave this space station.
[4814.73s -> 4823.11s]  Oh, that's nice. Oh, fuck, I forgot it's a robot in a video game after the 2012.
[4823.11s -> 4844.92s]  There's something weird is going on and we better hurry. Hold on, I'll open the door for
[4844.92s -> 4862.55s]  you. The password was Olympic Banana. What a weird password. So it's just me and you, huh?
[4865.27s -> 4868.79s]  He was doing hunt and peck. What's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with that.
[4877.13s -> 4890.82s]  Open it manually in the control room. Control room's on the left. Okay, what about over here?
[4890.82s -> 4913.38s]  Anything? This is pretty well made. Can I do this? There we are, the control room.
[4921.61s -> 4927.98s]  I don't remember that there were that many buttons. So press the button that activates
[4927.98s -> 4935.22s]  what? This? Let's see. It can't be that difficult, right? Oh, well, is this a job
[4935.22s -> 4951.35s]  for you or a job for me? Who does this? This is your sub sound. It kind of is. All right,
[4951.35s -> 4964.34s]  we'll press it. Well, it's my fault. There's going to be a monster right here when he turns
[4964.34s -> 4969.22s]  the lights on. It's going to be scary. Watch this. I told you. Lights go on.
[4973.64s -> 4982.89s]  No, unfortunately. At least the door is open now, I guess. Anyway, let's hurry.
[4987.75s -> 4990.87s]  Okay, let me ask you guys a question. How much money do you think I could make
[4991.74s -> 5000.92s]  if I just did that? Like this. If I was cute robot in horror game, do you think I'd make
[5000.92s -> 5010.10s]  some money? Do you think I would get if anyone would want that? I mean, it would
[5010.10s -> 5026.57s]  clearly just be a guy going like, but would it be cute? It might be. This is open. Can I
[5026.57s -> 5051.21s]  look through there? Between four and fifteen dollars. That's not very much. Here we go. That's
[5051.21s -> 5061.67s]  the ship. Let us get out of here. Well, it's not called the encounter because nothing.
[5061.67s -> 5070.04s]  The playable demo ends here, but I would be updated soon. Oh, it is. So that is the end.
[5072.20s -> 5081.86s]  Carrot7, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you, Carrot7. So this is just a demo of
[5081.86s -> 5092.15s]  what's coming. I mean, this is a pretty well made space station. It really was. You know,
[5092.15s -> 5107.54s]  come on. I gotta rate these. Hello? Why can I not move? That was good. Here we go. Slayer
[5108.10s -> 5111.30s]  scenes. There's so many of these. Eat apple swing sword.
[5114.84s -> 5123.54s]  Dwarf orders no slayers allowed in the inn. Everyone is afraid of slayers ever since that
[5123.54s -> 5130.98s]  lunatic burned an entire village. The dwarf says having you inside his inn is not good for
[5130.98s -> 5139.00s]  business. Well, what do I do now? I have a scroll to complete. If you ask me, you should
[5139.00s -> 5145.96s]  win back the favor of this town. There's plenty of people here who could use your help.
[5146.60s -> 5152.92s]  If the people like you, the dwarf would have no reason to keep you out. I have a feeling that
[5152.92s -> 5165.08s]  this is very long. This one is a real passionate person that has 40 or 50 different screens here.
[5167.82s -> 5179.51s]  Town favor zero out of five. Can I talk to townspeople? Oh, they have quest markers.
[5180.07s -> 5192.44s]  That's the how to train the dragon guy. All right, I've never seen how to train the dragon
[5192.44s -> 5198.28s]  before. Any of the movies. But every trailer I ever watched, I was always curious. And
[5198.28s -> 5201.64s]  somebody explain to me maybe if it makes sense or not. I don't know. I just, I didn't get it.
[5203.00s -> 5209.00s]  Why is the main, why does the main character talk like this? Is there a reason for that? I
[5209.00s -> 5216.22s]  don't know. The rest of the cast is like this. And they're talking. Oh, my friend,
[5216.22s -> 5220.30s]  you can't be you can't be serious. Well, you know, it's just me, the main character.
[5220.30s -> 5227.29s]  Is there a reason why that is? I just I didn't know. I thought it was there some reason for
[5227.29s -> 5245.91s]  it is to make him out of place. Oh, yeah, I just didn't know if he was like from a different
[5245.91s -> 5255.37s]  land or something. Because he's a pathetic weak dweeb like you. What? I don't talk like I
[5255.37s -> 5265.18s]  don't talk like that. Do I talk like this? No, I talk like this. I have a strong voice,
[5265.18s -> 5270.78s]  a powerful voice, a voice that commands a voice that demands. You know what I'm saying?
[5272.07s -> 5280.41s]  My voice is strong. Hey there, Mr. Slayer Slayers are brave, aren't they? Yes, we are.
[5286.73s -> 5293.86s]  I wish I was brave. But since you are, can you help me do something brave? Get on with
[5293.86s -> 5299.11s]  it. I don't have all day. I'm ready to help. Sure. What do you need? I want you to tell
[5299.11s -> 5309.82s]  this girl that I like her. She's easy to find. She's the prettiest of them all. How is this?
[5312.28s -> 5316.68s]  I'll tell her but you have to be more specific. Fine. But all you peasants dress the same
[5316.68s -> 5323.72s]  and look the same to me. You have to be more specific. She's playing by the other snowman.
[5325.03s -> 5334.06s]  All right. Okay, Toothless. Let's go find ourselves an adventure to go on, Toothless.
[5334.86s -> 5354.01s]  Where's the other snowman? That's not her, right? Where's the other snowman? No,
[5354.01s -> 5356.73s]  do you have a quest marker? There's too many quest markers. I need to focus.
[5362.92s -> 5373.70s]  Other snowman. The lady with the pretzel? The lady with the yogurt dip pretzel? No, I don't
[5373.70s -> 5401.22s]  think so. Where's the other snowman? Skip this one. No, it was a gunshot. Someone just shot a rifle.
[5404.78s -> 5414.60s]  This is going to take forever. Just hold on. Just wait, wait, wait. There it is. There,
[5414.60s -> 5421.59s]  there, there, there, there. You haven't even completed one out of five. They're all going to
[5421.59s -> 5437.86s]  be very quick. Oh, I like him too. Thank you for telling me. You have another mission to do?
[5438.42s -> 5465.91s]  Was she going over there? This feels really weird being a fucking adult here.
[5468.14s -> 5475.32s]  You know what? I don't want to be over here. All right, I'm going to go this way.
[5483.22s -> 5486.10s]  Oh, you two like each other? That's cool. I'm just going to sit here and just watch.
[5486.82s -> 5494.57s]  Get out of here, dude. Fuck off. What's this guy? Hey there, buddy. You look like someone
[5494.57s -> 5500.73s]  who can help me. I left a valuable on the roof of my house. Can you grab it?
[5504.54s -> 5507.50s]  You got it up there, you can get it down. How do I get up there?
[5510.68s -> 5524.38s]  I appreciate your help, slayer. Is this your house? Yeah, I just- that's right, that's right.
[5524.38s -> 5531.46s]  I just killed a dragon and instead of being led into the village, I have to play matchmaker
[5531.46s -> 5543.50s]  for like eight-year-olds and get a frisbee off of a roof. Can't make this? Oh, right
[5543.50s -> 5558.50s]  here. I can't skip this one, guys. Don't you understand? I can't. Shit. How do I crouch?
[5565.83s -> 5577.30s]  What is wrong with your house? God damn it. Why would you build it like this? Why would this guy
[5577.30s -> 5590.14s]  have his house like this? Is it gonna take an hour? No, it's not. This is a really well-made
[5590.14s -> 5597.86s]  experience, but this guy's house definitely shouldn't be built like this. He has just like
[5597.86s -> 5608.57s]  a weird stairway to the top of his house. Take- it's actually a bottle boot. All right,
[5608.57s -> 5614.39s]  well here you go. I'm gonna- I'm gonna jump and press fucking R1 and hope I fucking slash
[5614.39s -> 5634.02s]  him. Thank you, Slayer. Please don't tell my wife. No, I'm not Mr. Meeseeks. I'm gonna get this
[5634.02s -> 5638.95s]  one done. How did that get on the roof? Yeah, he just grabbed it by the handle and like
[5640.15s -> 5655.10s]  he threw it as hard as he could up there. Look at me. God damn it. Look at me.
[5659.46s -> 5666.06s]  I've been chasing my dog for hours. Could you help me catch him? Usually I kill wild
[5666.06s -> 5672.23s]  beasts like your dog. Why would you say that? He's fast. I have gone dizzy running in circles.
[5672.23s -> 5693.02s]  He's right behind you. Where'd he go? Just grab him. He's right next to you. Grab him.
[5697.88s -> 5709.82s]  He just hit his head on the wall. Come here. I'm just gonna wait in his path.
[5709.82s -> 5725.62s]  His AI path goes this way. I'm just gonna wait there. Get him? Thank you. I'll make
[5725.62s -> 5737.26s]  sure he behaves. All right, only two more. You put- I tripped him. Yeah, I stuck my leg out.
[5737.82s -> 5749.51s]  I did like a Tom and Jerry. I can't go- no, that's where I need to go.
[5761.91s -> 5771.58s]  Drink the snow. You can't drink the snow. Where's the last two quests? There was one
[5771.58s -> 5779.75s]  up here, right? I know. This is not supposed to be a Slayer Scrolls stream. I'm aware of
[5779.75s -> 5790.38s]  that but that's what it's turning into but I just have to know what happened. It's the
[5790.38s -> 5792.62s]  dwarf, right? Did I kill this guy?
[5807.67s -> 5811.83s]  Yes, I killed him. Yeah, so there was a dragon up there. Maybe that got him.
[5811.83s -> 5815.51s]  Yes, I think he regretted his life of crime and left for a new life. You are the first
[5815.51s -> 5828.04s]  dwarf I've seen in years. There was a dragon up there. I think the dragon may have got him.
[5828.04s -> 5835.08s]  So he really is dead. I always knew his life of crime will end this way. I'll miss him
[5835.08s -> 5842.52s]  but I'm glad you told me. I needed closure. Without him, I've decided to use my axe for
[5842.52s -> 5855.21s]  honest work instead. Good. Look, I killed him. The dragon killed him. Somebody killed him.
[5855.21s -> 5872.63s]  That's all he needs to know, right? Doesn't matter if I killed him or not. He's been
[5872.63s -> 5885.43s]  killed. Yes, it does. Yeah, but he was a criminal. He just, okay, he killed somebody.
[5886.07s -> 5890.47s]  He literally robbed a guy and murdered him and I got vengeance for that person that he was
[5890.47s -> 5906.01s]  robbing and killing. Does it really matter if I got him or the dragon did? I heard you've
[5906.01s -> 5913.14s]  been helping the people of this town, Slayer. I need your help too. Oh, by the way, I'm a
[5913.14s -> 5921.30s]  Slayer. I'm not a negotiator. I'm a Slayer. It's in my name. It's in my first name.
[5928.01s -> 5934.81s]  Monsters have shown up in the crypt below town. The other guards have sealed it shut
[5935.45s -> 5941.78s]  but I keep worrying what will happen if they get out. To be honest with you,
[5942.74s -> 5948.74s]  being the first woman of the town guard, I feel like I have to prove myself.
[5951.93s -> 5964.58s]  We're both going in. Yeah, let's both go in. Follow me. Do I have a weapon? I don't even
[5964.58s -> 5984.58s]  have a weapon. Can I have a sword? We have to go down into the crypt. Oh, shit. Oh,
[5984.58s -> 5997.77s]  we have a new card now. Spring forest. This is where we went. This almost looks hand painted.
[5999.27s -> 6007.06s]  Gun blood. Point your gun in the air when ready. Aim. Fire. What? Wait, wait, wait,
[6007.06s -> 6028.25s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Aim. Okay. So, aim. Enemy AI is activated. Connective. Was that just?
[6044.33s -> 6065.64s]  What? Hey, you didn't give me a second. Oh my god.
[6080.94s -> 6101.10s]  Okay, come on, please. He's so much faster than I am. Did it. Okay, I won. Slayer scrolls.
[6101.10s -> 6104.78s]  Enter the crypt. This crypt is older than the town. It has been here for ages. Now,
[6104.78s -> 6109.26s]  all of a sudden, the dead in the crypt have risen. I can't imagine what will happen to
[6109.26s -> 6119.24s]  the town if they get out. We will clear the crypt of these monsters. Did she just get crushed?
[6122.22s -> 6153.99s]  Did we both die? No. A little place in outer space. Is that it? L1. This is trippy. What the
[6153.99s -> 6172.41s]  hell? Oh, I just have to activate all the objects? This really is Mario Galaxy. Yeah,
[6172.41s -> 6176.22s]  this one, this one's really, really awesome. This is really cool, but it's gonna, I'm
[6176.22s -> 6211.26s]  gonna throw up if I keep playing it. It's gonna go slow. What the fuck? Is that where I just,
[6211.26s -> 6217.70s]  whoa. Don't look up. Don't look up. Ever. They always say don't look down, but in these 3D
[6217.70s -> 6235.45s]  spherical games, don't look up. Did I make it all the way back around? This is wild. Which
[6235.45s -> 6245.80s]  way is up? I don't know. Ready to go home? Yes, I'm tired. Slayer scrolls, scene eight.
[6245.80s -> 6260.50s]  Crypt fight. We still live. All right, we ready? Where's, um, where's my companion?
[6264.97s -> 6290.55s]  Did she get crushed by the rocks? Holy shit. Oh, they're coming to life off the walls. Those
[6290.55s -> 6326.62s]  eyes are terrifying. Where are you? Behind me? Shit. The music for this stuff is just baked in.
[6331.51s -> 6339.82s]  Wait, that's her. Where have you been? I was so scared. I hid over here. I am sorry,
[6339.82s -> 6349.32s]  Slayer. I am just not strong enough to be a guard. The other guards left this threat under
[6349.32s -> 6354.60s]  the town. You are stronger than the rest to have come down here. If it helps, all you guards are
[6354.60s -> 6371.80s]  puny cowards, not just you. That's so, well, yeah, that dialogue, that's just so mean and
[6371.80s -> 6377.42s]  rude. Okay, we've been nice the whole time. Let's see what the, what the rude path is.
[6388.20s -> 6405.93s]  Oh, I killed a monster. I can't wait to tell everyone. Crossing over. I can't wait to tell
[6405.93s -> 6419.80s]  all my friends I did it. I slayed a skeleton. Ultra realistic FPS prototype. Okay, ultra
[6419.80s -> 6436.25s]  realistic. Hold it. Inspect weapon. So this is ultra realistic. Eliminate the target at apartment
[6436.25s -> 6446.66s]  24 lane. You got it. The story continues after launch. Make sure you mark this one. 24 lane.
[6448.17s -> 6455.80s]  24 lane. There's an invisible wall here. I can't go any further. It's 24 lane. 24?
[6467.77s -> 6486.30s]  I think that means that it's not done. 24 lane is not available yet. I can't, I don't
[6486.30s -> 6497.56s]  think I can shoot the gun. No, there's an invisible wall. Oh, just you wait. When this
[6497.56s -> 6520.54s]  launches. Upstairs window. Oh, I can't even fire the gun. Window, window, window, what?
[6521.50s -> 6536.06s]  What do you mean window? Door, window, door, window. I can't shoot the gun. Whoa, whoa!
[6536.70s -> 6542.68s]  That's a person's head, right? With their ears. He's looking out the window right
[6542.68s -> 6569.86s]  now. See his ears? Fucking controller aim. My god. Beautiful stone wall town. No, it can't
[6569.86s -> 6577.02s]  be. Wait, they've burnt the town? Who burnt the town to the ground? This is really, really raging.
[6580.17s -> 6604.07s]  It can't be. Don't walk through the fire. Um, what do we, how do we, what do we do? Um,
[6604.07s -> 6622.14s]  do I have to jump it? Can we talk? Fight the fire. I don't, I don't even have a
[6622.14s -> 6633.46s]  sword anymore. Is that, is there another exit? Eat an apple. That didn't do anything.
[6634.10s -> 6645.86s]  Oh, it gave me extra health. Uh, I think we may have gotten to the end of this one.
[6646.50s -> 6667.29s]  Didn't I kill the dragon? No. Right through her head.
[6669.64s -> 6674.60s]  I heard there might be a fellow slayer in stone wall. I expected more from you,
[6674.60s -> 6679.96s]  but thank you. Slaying a slayer always brings me great pleasure. Nice rhyme.
[6681.56s -> 6687.78s]  She sells slayers on the seashore. Slayers and pleasure. I want you to know slayer as
[6687.78s -> 6692.74s]  much as joyous I get from this massacre. I do not think do die out to this for fun.
[6694.44s -> 6713.78s]  This was all written on a scroll. Holy shit. That's insane looking. What a twist. Yeah.
[6720.82s -> 6726.28s]  That's really, really awesome looking. Okay. I, uh, cone ball. I need to,
[6726.84s -> 6729.88s]  this is too much fun though. It's too interesting. We got to make something.
[6730.86s -> 6738.15s]  Even if it's something stupid. Move, jump, charge. Released when charged to slam.
[6738.15s -> 6748.31s]  Jump and slam down for extra power. Move, jump, and then charge. Okay. Goals to win.
[6748.87s -> 6767.03s]  Here we go. Oh, fuck. Hold on. Slayer scrolls. By life took lemons. The saga has
[6767.03s -> 6786.94s]  only begun. I can't wait for slayer scrolls 2 to come out. I have a cone ball. Let's go.
[6792.82s -> 6808.31s]  After credit screen. Three, two, one. Action. Oh, I'm red. I thought I was blue. Didn't I
[6808.31s -> 6828.10s]  select blue? I selected blue. This is just rocket league or soccer. Not everything is
[6828.10s -> 6833.30s]  rocket league. Rocket league is based off of playing soccer. So have I really become one
[6833.30s -> 6838.18s]  of those like millennials that doesn't even say the name of the thing that it is. I reference
[6838.18s -> 6846.23s]  to like, it's rocket league. This is not rocket league. It's football. God damn millennials.
[6847.19s -> 6860.36s]  Millennials calling shit when it's not supposed to be called. That doesn't,
[6860.36s -> 6865.08s]  that doesn't count. Look, if I, if I play basketball and I go under the hoop and I throw
[6865.08s -> 6873.54s]  it up, so it goes under the bottom of the net. It's not a basket. Fucking millennials.
[6874.18s -> 6891.08s]  What is this called? Polarity. Press X to start. I thought X jumped. Apparently not.
[6891.08s -> 6909.72s]  X turns you blue. Press X to repel from blue platforms. Oh, press circle to repel from red
[6909.72s -> 6932.97s]  platforms. This is really interesting though. This is neat. I can't wait to make something
[6932.97s -> 6965.30s]  neat like this. How do I get that? Nice. All right. This is going to be odd. Finish.
[6965.94s -> 6981.93s]  Paddle extreme ultra DX. No way. This even pong. I'm not very, I'm not going to pong.
[6981.93s -> 6998.10s]  I told you. This is just rocket league. Oh cool, dude. You're playing pixel rocket league.
[7002.95s -> 7005.99s]  No, no. You call it what it's supposed to be called and that's pong.
[7011.90s -> 7016.22s]  It's not pong though. You're using the boomer rocket league terminology.
[7016.22s -> 7021.74s]  I know. I'm aware of this. It's tennis, but we called it pong when I was 12.
[7022.54s -> 7045.08s]  Just kidding. Can I just go once on this guy? You know, a friend of mine actually taught me
[7045.08s -> 7050.76s]  how to play pong well and it's hard to do, but actually it's pretty good tactic. You should
[7050.76s -> 7055.88s]  never look on the right side of the screen when you play pong. You should only be looking on your
[7055.88s -> 7060.52s]  side of the screen. That is what I was told to do and it actually is the way you're supposed
[7060.52s -> 7065.80s]  to play because it makes it so you can adjust very, very quickly. Never look at what the
[7065.80s -> 7069.96s]  ball's doing on their side of the screen, but you know, that's not, that's a great tip
[7069.96s -> 7079.27s]  actually. Somebody said that was a bad tip. No, it's not. This person that told me this by the way
[7080.79s -> 7085.03s]  never lost one game of pong. They could go for like four hours. They had like one of those
[7085.03s -> 7089.59s]  high scores where it was like a two to three hour long experience. This is all made up.
[7089.59s -> 7093.27s]  None of this is true, but take my word for it that you should be looking at your side
[7093.27s -> 7102.52s]  of the screen and it's okay. I'm just gonna go this way. Marvel us. Marvelous.
[7102.52s -> 7107.54s]  Oh, I get it. This one's called I.
[7120.46s -> 7127.45s]  All right. I like we're getting these terms of service. End user license agreements.
[7130.33s -> 7147.14s]  Don't fade into the dark. Reach for the light. Created by disarmed. Move.
[7160.95s -> 7172.17s]  Gun. Added to inventory. Inventory. Um, okay. Neural chip and weapon pistol.
[7174.26s -> 7179.38s]  R1 is flashlight. Wizz gun. Your health is represented by the health stability.
[7180.62s -> 7184.06s]  Maintain this by using health objects you find. If it goes below red, you will die.
[7185.24s -> 7210.62s]  Use your ammo wisely. Okay. New path unlocked. Environment. Green grass groove.
[7211.34s -> 7226.47s]  Oh no. But it's just a ball. Green grass groove. Sonic. It's just a sonic meatball.
[7238.07s -> 7242.55s]  Pretty good job with the sounds though. And I like the terrain. Good job with the terrain too.
[7243.27s -> 7249.77s]  All right. It's a time to start to start to make something. I want to see what I just want
[7249.77s -> 7257.03s]  to check out the tools and it's time. We got to get pretty good taste. We'll do one more
[7257.03s -> 7263.18s]  after this. Can I do any other moves like sonic moves? You know like the sonic dash and
[7263.18s -> 7274.98s]  shit on his chest. I need 15 coins to open this. What the hell is that? Wait, did I just
[7277.98s -> 7293.42s]  unlock that? I think I just actually that's mine now. All right. Let's take a look what we can do.
[7296.82s -> 7315.22s]  Last one. This is called 2. So we need to see this. Find the code for the keypad. Hold L1
[7315.22s -> 7332.58s]  to sprint. I don't think I want to do that. That kind of hurts my head. This is so cool.
[7332.58s -> 7348.44s]  This is even possible though. Do I have any bullets? Pain killers. Oh, I'm stable now.
[7350.73s -> 7356.49s]  Can motion blur be turned off? Well, this is on PS4. I don't know if it can. Let's see. My
[7356.49s -> 7372.04s]  preferences. Display. Visual feedback. Menu position prompts. Accessibility. Controls. No,
[7372.04s -> 7381.77s]  it's PS4. As we all know, you cannot really change any graphical options on the PlayStation 4.
[7382.25s -> 7412.30s]  Or any console for that matter. It's just locked in. It is locked in. Where do I go here? What is
[7412.30s -> 7428.28s]  this? Power? Power to what? Well, it looks like we're going to follow this. Yeah, this is PS4
[7428.28s -> 7445.80s]  only. Can I pull this chain? Can I just interact with the door? I can't interact with
[7445.80s -> 7468.87s]  the chain. Oh, the keypad. I don't have the key code. The game already exists on PC. It's
[7468.87s -> 7477.98s]  called Unity. Yeah, but like, you'll see when we actually get to the creating aspect of it.
[7477.98s -> 7486.36s]  It's not, I mean, it is a game engine, but it's not at the same time. It's also like an
[7486.92s -> 7496.23s]  art set. It's like painting and sculpting and I can't go over here. It's like a little big
[7496.23s -> 7499.35s]  planet 4. It's like they took a little big planet and said, you know what, let's make
[7499.35s -> 7517.50s]  this 10 times more elaborate. Turn on. Well, new path unlocked. All right. Well, what the
[7517.50s -> 7540.23s]  hell is that? Connected. Is it like a monster now? All right. It's time. Oh, all right. Here we go.
[7540.23s -> 7546.09s]  Perfect timing. Auto surf complete. You experienced 30 creations. Let us know what
[7546.09s -> 7552.98s]  you thought to help us with future surfing. Oh, okay. We can go through and rate them.
[7556.86s -> 7560.70s]  I remember this. This is, we already had this one. What was this one? This one was pretty
[7560.70s -> 7570.87s]  cool. What does it say? This has been thumbed up 14,000 times. PT. I'm going to
[7570.87s -> 7579.30s]  give PT thumbs up, but not all the PTs. Please hug me. That was cool. Uh, curiosity. Curiosity
[7579.30s -> 7583.78s]  was really, really technically well done, but the game there was a little just, I don't know.
[7583.78s -> 7594.60s]  I think I already rated this one. I forget what this one even was. Oh, this one. I like that
[7594.60s -> 7602.65s]  one. Yeah. Thumbs up that one. Super Mario got a thumbs that one up. Dark dungeon, dark soul.
[7602.65s -> 7607.62s]  Yeah. Let me through the thumbs that one up. This is the guitar hero one. Yeah, that was
[7607.62s -> 7615.62s]  good. Ramp 3D. I don't know. Yeah, no, it was good. Slayer scrolls. Absolutely thumbs up.
[7616.68s -> 7623.50s]  Oi, what are you looking at? Thumbs up. Uh, I'm not going to rate it because it wouldn't,
[7623.50s -> 7627.10s]  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't, it was just kind of a little demo of the environment.
[7628.09s -> 7634.52s]  Is the Zelda forest book of the dragon working portal gun demo. I'm going to give
[7634.52s -> 7639.00s]  you a thumbs up just because PlayStation home. I don't, I didn't really, I'm not going to
[7639.00s -> 7643.90s]  down rate it, but thumbs this up. What did it? Oh, okay. I already have it rated.
[7644.82s -> 7650.78s]  The encounter is well done. Art gallery. I don't need to rate it. Gun Blood is the,
[7652.70s -> 7655.66s]  the duel. Here's Mario Odyssey. I'm not going to rate it, make me almost puke,
[7655.66s -> 7661.64s]  but it was still cool. Uh, ultra realistic FPS prototype. I'm not going to rate it.
[7661.64s -> 7666.12s]  It wasn't anything really there. It was interesting environment though.
[7666.12s -> 7670.76s]  Cone ball. Yeah. Polarity was cute, but I don't know if I wanted to give it. I'm
[7670.76s -> 7674.76s]  going to give rocket league. Uh, I'm going to give 1980s rocket league a thumbs up.
[7674.76s -> 7680.98s]  This is the Sonic one. And then this is the currently bugged version of visceral.
[7680.98s -> 7689.78s]  All right. I think we're good. Very, very cool. All right. I leveled up.
[7689.78s -> 7699.67s]  Innovation, audio, curation, design, play art. What did I do? You are level three.
[7699.67s -> 7703.99s]  You're still finding your way in the dream. In verse. So we can't assign you a person
[7703.99s -> 7707.86s]  yet. We should have a better idea of who you are by level five.
[7708.42s -> 7724.94s]  Okay. Uh, it's my personality test. So we got, we did auto surf, haunted mansion with kitchen.
[7724.94s -> 7735.13s]  All right. Let's just go back and actually do dream shaping. See what we can do.
[7739.94s -> 7749.80s]  I'm very, very ready. This is dream shaping. Here. You have the power to manifest anything
[7749.80s -> 7759.19s]  you can imagine. Music, a story, a piece of art, a whole game, even something there is
[7759.19s -> 7765.96s]  no word for yet. I'm excited. Create things from scratch using the dream tools. Here
[7765.96s -> 7769.88s]  comes a 10 hour tutorial to remix something another dreamer has made.
[7771.56s -> 7777.32s]  Maybe not that long. I'll take you to the dreams workshop where my friend, the dreams
[7777.32s -> 7782.12s]  architect will introduce you to the secrets of creation.
[7784.94s -> 7788.78s]  How is that not porn on this yet? How, what are you talking about?
[7788.78s -> 7791.90s]  Go on in. He won't bite. Promise.
[7793.66s -> 7799.86s]  It's been up for like four days. Relax. Or what? Like a week? Not even? No, no,
[7799.86s -> 7807.24s]  no. Don't relax. Like relax as in it's not going to be here. Okay. Start dreaming
[7807.24s -> 7815.08s]  one tutorial to unlock this feature. Wait, what? Okay. We have to do the dreams workshop.
[7816.66s -> 7826.54s]  Master classes and techniques. I'm ready. I'm so excited for this.
[7826.54s -> 7832.94s]  So you want to learn the ropes of dream shaping, but you don't know where the
[7832.94s -> 7838.70s]  tools are on the shelf or how to use that intriguing gadget. Or you want to know what
[7838.70s -> 7846.54s]  that strange contraption over there does. Architect, assist us. I think it'd be easy.
[7847.50s -> 7856.33s]  Hello architect. Hello Queenie. Why am I a squirrel? Just a temporary physical form for you.
[7856.33s -> 7861.69s]  I like it. It's cute. Well, thank you. It's better than the last one.
[7862.73s -> 7869.13s]  Now show this dream shaper how to unleash their creative power. Done. Follow me,
[7869.13s -> 7873.21s]  dreamer. Oh, it's so exciting that you're here. I have been really looking forward to
[7873.29s -> 7879.53s]  this. There is so much to show you. Gameplay, animation, art. There's no limit to what's
[7879.53s -> 7886.04s]  possible. Give me the tools. This is the dreams workshop. We got a lot of
[7889.80s -> 7899.82s]  so guys, we all I think can be comfortable knowing that this is going to look probably
[7899.82s -> 7904.55s]  and do this for a while. Start dreaming, gain the power to make your own dreams come true
[7904.55s -> 7916.25s]  by first getting to know the basics. Two months of streams. Oh Jesus. Are you new
[7916.25s -> 7920.41s]  to dream shaping? The start dreaming tutorials are your entry point to creating. Here you'll
[7920.41s -> 7923.93s]  get to know the basics of edit mode, navigating scenes and the assembly tools.
[7923.93s -> 7936.92s]  There are eight steps. Part one, step one of probably 50 to 100 parts. You're just
[7936.92s -> 7943.30s]  doing a labo. Going blind? You guys can't do that. And I physically can't do that
[7943.30s -> 7948.90s]  because I have to complete this first. No, I'm going to do this. I've been waiting
[7948.90s -> 7954.38s]  a long time for this game. I've been waiting a decade for this game to come out. I've
[7954.38s -> 7959.27s]  been waiting longer for dreams than I probably have for the winds of winter. It's a long
[7959.27s -> 7969.62s]  time. So I'm going to start. Find quantities first. What's going on?
[7969.78s -> 7977.11s]  I've got some spectacular tricks to show you and some that are just all right. Make
[7977.11s -> 7981.11s]  sure you follow the steps carefully if you want to get the most out of this. I need
[7981.11s -> 7986.87s]  to start drinking. No, it's not just about getting to the end. It's the journey that
[7986.87s -> 7993.19s]  counts. I'm going to start drinking. You'll be in edit mode, creating and editing your
[7993.83s -> 8006.02s]  own scenes. First, I'm going to show you how to move around a scene. This is the scene.
[8006.02s -> 8010.34s]  I don't get it. I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow. You can see that we're in edit
[8010.34s -> 8016.02s]  mode because the assembly mode icon is in the top left of the screen. If you ever
[8016.02s -> 8021.22s]  need to remind yourself of the controls, select that icon with the X button. So we're
[8021.22s -> 8027.03s]  in assembly mode. And select it again to hide the controls. You can also see
[8027.03s -> 8031.51s]  the assembly menu at the top of the screen. That's where you'll find all the
[8031.51s -> 8037.32s]  tools and modes you need to construct your scenes. The assembly menu is opened
[8037.32s -> 8042.68s]  and closed by pressing the square button. You won't need it just yet, so go
[8042.68s -> 8048.52s]  ahead and close it with square. Okay. First, I'm going to show you how to
[8048.52s -> 8053.66s]  move around in edit mode, as it's a bit different from play mode. To give
[8053.74s -> 8058.62s]  you something to do, I've hidden a puppet somewhere in the scene, which we'll need
[8058.62s -> 8064.06s]  in later tutorials. I've left some clues to help you find it. It's probably
[8064.06s -> 8068.30s]  behind this. Before we search for the first clue, let's start by looking
[8068.30s -> 8073.54s]  around. Left stick. In front of you, you can see a floating island with some
[8073.54s -> 8078.50s]  shapes on it. I can. If you move the right stick to the left and right,
[8078.50s -> 8084.10s]  you can look around the scene. Is there an orange cone around here?
[8084.10s -> 8091.06s]  Um, um, you found it. No, I didn't. There's a blue cube around here
[8091.06s -> 8095.22s]  somewhere too. What? See if you can find it. Oh, they're talking about in the
[8095.22s -> 8101.22s]  outer space. Now try looking up with the right stick to find the pink
[8101.22s -> 8110.07s]  pyramid. That's the one. Okay, let's turn back towards the shapes
[8110.07s -> 8115.43s]  floating on the island. My first clue is hidden somewhere on this island.
[8115.51s -> 8124.39s]  My first clue. Yeah, I looked at it already. This is your clue.
[8135.05s -> 8143.86s]  I already knew that. There's the clue. It's right here. Circle it.
[8146.98s -> 8159.70s]  We're almost done.
[8172.60s -> 8178.84s]  Okay. That's what I'm gonna do.
[8179.00s -> 8185.00s]  Maximize it to watch in instructions view. Maximize the video? In instructions view,
[8185.00s -> 8189.14s]  you can see more information about the steps.
[8189.14s -> 8193.46s]  Once the current step is finished, press the arrow button to move on to
[8193.46s -> 8199.67s]  the next one. Three fifty two. Done. Second to do.
[8199.67s -> 8205.51s]  Did you find that clue? It was on the back of one of those shapes.
[8205.51s -> 8209.51s]  Looks a bit like a rocket. So this really, yeah, this really does
[8209.51s -> 8214.95s]  treat you like you're four.
[8214.95s -> 8219.83s]  Alright, anything related to rockets.
[8219.83s -> 8223.91s]  Okay, island in the distance. Those shapes look a lot like the ones in the
[8223.91s -> 8227.99s]  clue. They do.
[8228.63s -> 8233.14s]  Remember, push up on the left stick to move forward
[8233.14s -> 8237.30s]  and use the right stick to change direction. And don't forget,
[8237.30s -> 8240.66s]  you can recalibrate your imp by holding the options button.
[8240.66s -> 8246.95s]  Yes, and make sure you do a loop. Two loops wrap around and pull
[8246.95s -> 8250.55s]  to keep your shoes on. Alright, what do I do now?
[8250.55s -> 8254.87s]  Make sure you're looking right at the cylinder and the cone.
[8254.87s -> 8258.71s]  When you're ready, move on to the next step. Oh fuck, that was all I had to do?
[8258.79s -> 8262.98s]  Well these steps are really easy though, so we're going to blow through this.
[8262.98s -> 8269.83s]  Think back to the first clue. The cone was on top of the cylinder, right?
[8269.83s -> 8274.01s]  How can you move them? Well in edit mode, you interact with
[8274.01s -> 8277.53s]  everything using your imp. The very tip of your imp's pointing mark.
[8277.53s -> 8281.21s]  He's going to show us how to make a porn game.
[8281.21s -> 8286.84s]  I don't believe that will. That shows you what tool the imp is using.
[8286.84s -> 8290.76s]  Right now, it's the arrow's icon, which means the imp is using the
[8290.76s -> 8295.13s]  move tool. That's the default tool in edit mode,
[8295.13s -> 8299.72s]  because editing a scene means moving things around a lot.
[8299.72s -> 8304.04s]  Let's see the imp in action. First, grab the cone,
[8304.04s -> 8309.27s]  hover over it with your imp, and hold R2.
[8309.27s -> 8313.67s]  Now your imp has the cone. Use the controller's motion sensor function to
[8313.67s -> 8317.66s]  move it around. Try to put it on top of the
[8317.66s -> 8323.42s]  cylinder, just like in the clue. Use the left stick to move the cone
[8323.50s -> 8329.67s]  backwards and forwards. Objects in scenes can intersect and
[8329.67s -> 8334.15s]  overlap, so it doesn't have to be perfect.
[8334.15s -> 8339.51s]  Get it roughly into place, and I'll show you how to refine it later.
[8339.51s -> 8347.69s]  Once for done, you're ready for the next step.
[8347.69s -> 8352.01s]  Now that looks pretty good, at least from this angle.
[8352.01s -> 8355.69s]  The 18 scenes in three-dimensional space
[8355.69s -> 8359.21s]  means that you should always look at your creations from different angles.
[8359.21s -> 8362.81s]  That's such a shitty job. No, it's not. The easiest way to do that
[8362.81s -> 8366.01s]  is with the grab cam. See, I didn't even know about that.
[8366.01s -> 8370.73s]  Instead of moving the objects you grab, grab cam moves your point of view
[8370.73s -> 8377.99s]  around them. Try it out on the cone. Grab cam. Hover over it, then press
[8377.99s -> 8383.43s]  and hold R1. Pushing the left and right
[8383.43s -> 8386.63s]  sticks moves your point of view around the cone.
[8386.63s -> 8392.01s]  Easy. Okay. Now that you can get a proper look at it,
[8392.01s -> 8397.29s]  check that the cone is on straight, unlike mine.
[8397.29s -> 8401.10s]  Let go of R1 to stop using the grab cam,
[8401.10s -> 8406.54s]  and use R2 to make any adjustments you need.
[8406.54s -> 8412.62s]  Here's a little secret called nudge. If you don't press R2 all the way down,
[8412.62s -> 8415.82s]  but just hold it lightly, you can move the cone
[8415.82s -> 8422.92s]  slowly, giving you finer control. Perfect. Once you're happy the cone
[8422.92s -> 8426.92s]  is straight, you can move on to the next step. That's perfect. I'm done.
[8426.92s -> 8435.19s]  Hey, did you find the clue? Another clue.
[8435.19s -> 8441.66s]  It's a molecule. I know because I put it there. Just play along with it.
[8441.66s -> 8444.54s]  Okay, there's the clue. What do you want me to do with it? Why don't you look
[8444.54s -> 8447.74s]  around with the right stick and see if you can find another
[8447.74s -> 8453.90s]  molecule? There's one over there by that island.
[8453.90s -> 8457.42s]  You're hot on the trail. I didn't even look and he told me.
[8457.42s -> 8460.94s]  It'll take forever to get there using the left stick.
[8460.94s -> 8465.34s]  Luckily, you can use the grab cam to get there faster.
[8465.34s -> 8471.90s]  Give it a try now. Hover your imp over that orange cube in the distance.
[8471.90s -> 8475.82s]  Hold R1 to grab it with the grab cam.
[8475.82s -> 8479.50s]  Then gently push up on the left stick to zoom right over.
[8479.50s -> 8484.98s]  I get it. Just keep holding R1 until you've made it all the way to
[8485.06s -> 8490.98s]  the island. Come on, come on, come on, come on. See, told you it was quicker,
[8490.98s -> 8495.19s]  but there's an even faster way to zip around scenes.
[8495.19s -> 8500.25s]  It's just like the grab cam, but you'll also need to hold L1.
[8500.25s -> 8503.77s]  You see, L1 is a very special button. Tell me more.
[8503.77s -> 8507.21s]  You know the way that on a computer keyboard, holding down shift
[8507.21s -> 8511.05s]  changes what some keys do? Well, it's a function key.
[8511.05s -> 8515.64s]  Holding down L1 changes what the other buttons do.
[8515.64s -> 8520.74s]  Maybe it's best if I show you. You see that rocket you built earlier?
[8520.74s -> 8526.86s]  Hover your imp over it. Now hold L1 and then press R1, the grab cam
[8526.86s -> 8529.34s]  button. You don't have to hold it or use the
[8529.34s -> 8533.42s]  stick this time. So you can just fly around.
[8533.42s -> 8537.66s]  Just skip the shit out of them. Try it out again on the return journey.
[8537.66s -> 8543.32s]  Hover your imp over the orange cube and hold L1.
[8543.40s -> 8554.41s]  Then press R1 to zoom right on over. No, fuck. I want to go forward 10
[8554.41s -> 8558.31s]  seconds. Now, that looks like the initial space is with the grab cam.
[8558.31s -> 8562.07s]  Just hold it lightly. You can move the cone slowly,
[8562.07s -> 8567.66s]  giving you finer control. Wait, what? Oh, this is the wrong one.
[8567.66s -> 8574.89s]  Hey, look at that. Find L1.
[8574.89s -> 8579.61s]  Whoa! Hover your imp over it. Now that you know how to move around quickly,
[8579.61s -> 8584.09s]  I gotta, okay, find the clue on the island. All right. Yeah.
[8584.09s -> 8587.77s]  Remember to use the grab cam to look around the whole island.
[8587.77s -> 8596.15s]  Once you've found the clue, you can move on.
[8596.15s -> 8604.92s]  Underneath? You want to, is that, I found a trash can.
[8604.92s -> 8611.14s]  Did you find the last clue? It was on the back of the orange cube.
[8611.14s -> 8615.22s]  What on earth could it mean? Trash can. If I had eyes, I would wink at you
[8615.22s -> 8619.22s]  right now. Hmm. I can't see any other green
[8619.30s -> 8622.34s]  trash cans in edit mode using the triangle button.
[8622.34s -> 8625.70s]  Got it. Just hover your imp over the cube,
[8625.70s -> 8634.23s]  then press triangle, and it's gone. These tools are powerful. Delete the
[8634.23s -> 8639.69s]  orange sphere next. If you change your mind or delete the
[8639.69s -> 8643.05s]  wrong thing, you can press undo, which is the left
[8643.05s -> 8647.16s]  directional button. How many undoes can you get?
[8647.16s -> 8651.51s]  Just press the right directional button.
[8651.51s -> 8654.63s]  You can undo and redo pretty much anything,
[8654.63s -> 8659.78s]  not just deletions. Oh look, there was a clue
[8659.78s -> 8663.54s]  hidden in the cube. It means to go up. An arrow.
[8663.54s -> 8668.49s]  Nice. Hmm. Perhaps there's another one like it nearby.
[8668.49s -> 8671.85s]  Look around with the right stick and see if you can spot it.
[8671.85s -> 8677.37s]  Found it. Once you've found it, you can move on to the next step.
[8677.37s -> 8686.28s]  Excellent. We're almost done. That was my final clue telling you where to go.
[8686.28s -> 8691.91s]  The island right above us. I know you're an expert in moving around with the
[8691.91s -> 8696.07s]  left and right stick. You're an expert in moving with the
[8696.07s -> 8700.42s]  left stick. Remember that holding L1 changes what
[8700.42s -> 8704.65s]  the grab cam does. It can also change what the left
[8704.65s -> 8708.52s]  stick does. Sure. Normally it moves you backwards
[8708.52s -> 8711.48s]  and forwards in the direction you're facing,
[8711.48s -> 8715.56s]  but if you hold L1 at the same time, the left stick will make you move
[8715.64s -> 8722.60s]  up and down instead. That's good. Cool. Get up to the last island.
[8722.60s -> 8725.72s]  I'm on the last island. Position yourself so you're looking at the orange arrow
[8725.72s -> 8732.01s]  which is pointing up. Oh. Now hold L1.
[8732.01s -> 8735.05s]  When you're ready, move on to the next step.
[8735.05s -> 8742.65s]  I will. Right. Here's the puppet I reserved for you.
[8742.65s -> 8748.49s]  Almost done. Let's call her Connie because she looks like a cone.
[8748.49s -> 8752.17s]  We need to help Connie walk through the door to complete this tutorial.
[8752.17s -> 8756.73s]  R2. To do that, we're gonna have to switch over to play mode.
[8756.73s -> 8759.45s]  Finally we get some new info. Finally some new intel.
[8759.45s -> 8765.16s]  You're in edit mode. This is where you create and edit your scenes.
[8765.16s -> 8770.12s]  In play mode, you can experience the scene just like a player would if they found it in the
[8770.12s -> 8774.28s]  dreamiverse. You can't make any changes in
[8774.28s -> 8777.48s]  play mode, but you can take control of characters
[8777.56s -> 8782.74s]  and try out what you've made. Switch over to play mode now.
[8782.74s -> 8786.90s]  Just press the options button on your controller.
[8786.90s -> 8791.14s]  Play mode. Hover over the controller icon with your imp.
[8791.14s -> 8795.85s]  Then press X to select it. I just did that.
[8795.85s -> 8800.57s]  To control a puppet in a scene, you first need to possess it with R2.
[8800.57s -> 8806.07s]  Now I get to play the game with whatever characters are here.
[8806.07s -> 8809.67s]  She's full of beans, isn't she? I gotta play something. I picked her just
[8809.75s -> 8813.19s]  for you. Walk her around a bit, then take her
[8813.19s -> 8817.03s]  through the door to finish this tutorial. There's no stairs there.
[8817.03s -> 8823.43s]  Oh, looks like the door's too high. Died in tutorial. Died in tutorial.
[8823.43s -> 8826.63s]  She might be able to reach it if you make her jump
[8826.63s -> 8833.13s]  by pressing X. Wait, I just did that. Oops, I remember now. I'm like 20
[8833.13s -> 8840.14s]  seconds ahead of them. Better head back into edit mode.
[8840.14s -> 8843.90s]  To switch back to edit mode, just press options again.
[8843.90s -> 8847.74s]  Then select the pencil icon. Tools. Modes.
[8847.74s -> 8851.90s]  Animate. Gadgets. Did you see those stairs on the island below us?
[8851.90s -> 8855.82s]  Those might come in handy now. Straight down to them with L1
[8855.82s -> 8861.78s]  and the left stick. If you've deleted the stairs,
[8861.78s -> 8867.13s]  you can use undo by pressing the left directional button.
[8867.13s -> 8872.41s]  Just keep pressing it until the stairs come back.
[8872.49s -> 8880.14s]  Okay, press and hold R2 to grab them. Now, without letting go, hold L1 and use
[8880.14s -> 8882.70s]  the left stick to strafe back up to Connie.
[8882.70s -> 8888.30s]  I'm already ahead of you. Place the stairs in front of the door
[8888.30s -> 8893.70s]  and let go of R2. There, that should do it.
[8893.70s -> 8897.85s]  That's, it's a little shitty, but it doesn't matter. Back to play mode now.
[8897.85s -> 8902.01s]  Remember, press options, then select the controller icon
[8902.01s -> 8906.81s]  with X. Tutorial one done. You'll be switching back and forth between
[8910.04s -> 8916.04s]  saving tutorial progress. Thank god. Don't have to do it again.
[8916.04s -> 8919.32s]  Start dreaming part one of four. Well done. You completed this tutorial. You'll be
[8919.32s -> 8921.72s]  able to return and replay any of the steps.
[8921.72s -> 8932.95s]  Only a few more of these. Use reward. Continue tutorials. Imp quest complete.
[8932.95s -> 8948.10s]  Use, what is this? Use reward? What do I get for this?
[8948.10s -> 8951.14s]  Home space editor? Is that what this is?
[8951.14s -> 8956.10s]  Ah, the home space editor. A great place to start your creative journey.
[8956.10s -> 8959.46s]  We're still working on this right now. In time,
[8959.46s -> 8962.42s]  you'll be able to put things you've made. So this is not done. So it feels
[8962.42s -> 8971.29s]  like your own. All right, so not done.
[8971.29s -> 8975.13s]  Look at all the wonderful things you found.
[8975.13s -> 8978.65s]  There's lots more where these came from. Prizes. And look at the things
[8978.65s -> 8985.35s]  the folks at Media Molecule left for you in MM style. MM
[8985.35s -> 8988.95s]  characters. Collection of characters created by the MM team.
[8988.95s -> 8998.18s]  Contraptions. Sculptures. Okay, what's this thing?
[8998.18s -> 9004.15s]  Fancy. Where's nice for it to go? Definitely so I can get, I want to
[9004.15s -> 9006.71s]  unlock this. I want to get this thing and put it over
[9006.71s -> 9018.52s]  here. Like down here, right? So I can jump.
[9018.52s -> 9022.02s]  Oh shit, I just placed two. All right, that's good.
[9022.02s -> 9035.02s]  Oh whoops. It's okay, I can fix it. All right, I can get that thing now. Let
[9035.02s -> 9050.78s]  me get this thing. Okay, give me over here. These have
[9050.78s -> 9062.42s]  collision, right? I've got another toy. I might as well get
[9062.42s -> 9076.73s]  this too while I'm still here. Whoops. Wait, can I just pick you up?
[9076.73s -> 9096.07s]  No. I'm gonna do the stairs. I might as well just do the stairs.
[9096.07s -> 9101.16s]  I can't jump. Can I not jump up the stairs? That was weird.
[9101.16s -> 9111.43s]  All right, back to tutorial. Dream shaping.
[9111.43s -> 9122.87s]  Level four. What do you get for leveling up? He's still finding a way. We
[9122.87s -> 9127.19s]  can't assign you persona. Level five. Now to explore the wider
[9127.19s -> 9134.39s]  world of dream shaping. All right, I can browse and create. I
[9134.39s -> 9139.54s]  feel like I need to know the other things.
[9139.54s -> 9151.40s]  Let's just see what happens. Go in raw. In a moment,
[9151.40s -> 9154.20s]  you'll be creating and editing your own scenes.
[9154.20s -> 9158.76s]  Recreate PT. Scenes are like levels in a game
[9158.76s -> 9161.96s]  or scenes in a movie. They're made up of
[9161.96s -> 9168.12s]  elements. Elements are like props, sets, music, effects, and characters.
[9168.12s -> 9171.40s]  Hey, this is gonna be bizarre, can't we? Anything that you can build inside a
[9171.40s -> 9176.66s]  scene and save the dream of us. Scenes are connected together to form
[9176.66s -> 9181.06s]  dreams. And these dreams can be found when
[9181.06s -> 9186.73s]  you go dream surfing. Recreate the tutorial. That would be
[9186.73s -> 9192.78s]  pretty hard. Scenes are like scenes. All right,
[9192.78s -> 9196.78s]  collection. Store, game scene, single player, co-op, puzzle, interactive
[9196.78s -> 9201.19s]  experiences. Features, shorts, visual novels, sit back
[9201.19s -> 9206.39s]  and enjoy. Galleries, playlists, expos,
[9206.39s -> 9212.39s]  characters, sculpture, contraption, music,
[9212.39s -> 9224.22s]  sound effect, instrument, vehicle, animation, effect, dreams. Oh my god.
[9224.22s -> 9243.61s]  I'm gonna pick instrument, I think. Soft piano, create.
[9243.61s -> 9255.99s]  How do I- dreamers. Make a dating sim. Well, hold on, if I first-
[9255.99s -> 9275.85s]  Sub sound? No. Strings. Very string playing techniques too from
[9275.85s -> 9333.10s]  legato to coal. I'm viewing the music? Where is it? Is it up there?
[9333.10s -> 9350.63s]  Whoa, um, what? So you can do C, A, F, volume? Spice?
[9350.63s -> 9429.85s]  Bend? This is why we need the tutorials. Holy shit. Okay, that's it. How does
[9429.85s -> 9455.37s]  that sound? How do I play it? Rewind and pause and
[9455.37s -> 9459.93s]  record. The perform tool. You're in sound mode.
[9459.93s -> 9469.06s]  I need perform tool. Play mode? Because I can't select that.
[9469.06s -> 9474.42s]  Perform tool? You know, if only there was some way to
[9474.42s -> 9484.74s]  learn all this. Yeah, I know. I'm getting out of here. I can't even
[9484.74s -> 9503.77s]  leave. Effect field? All this stuff. You can spend a thousand hours in this
[9503.77s -> 9507.74s]  game and still be figuring out how to do it.
[9507.74s -> 9523.70s]  Vehicle? Sound effects? Hold on. Underground catacombs? Air horn?
[9523.70s -> 9540.90s]  Really? So you can just- so you can upload sounds then?
[9540.98s -> 9545.72s]  Sports ball? Okay. You can make your own music.
[9545.72s -> 9553.18s]  Contraptions? Sculpture? Character? Game scene? All right. I'm going- I'm doing
[9553.18s -> 9555.42s]  the tutorials. I'm just gonna do them. You know
[9555.42s -> 9559.48s]  what I mean? You have to. You cannot go into a game like this
[9559.48s -> 9572.33s]  blind. It's not- it's just not possible. So here we go. Two out of four. Making
[9572.33s -> 9579.83s]  things bigger and smaller. See you in 20 hours. It has to be
[9579.83s -> 9585.51s]  done. I can't just not do this.
[9585.59s -> 9588.87s]  Because Connie's friend Cuthbert fell asleep in the Dreamiverse
[9588.87s -> 9593.75s]  and got stranded. Yes, he's a cube with legs.
[9593.75s -> 9597.75s]  Connie didn't choose her friends. I did.
[9597.75s -> 9602.15s]  So we need to fix these platforms if she's gonna reach the flag
[9602.15s -> 9607.93s]  and get to Cuthbert. Before we start, you can switch to play mode to see how
[9607.93s -> 9612.60s]  a player would experience this scene. Yeah, it's already all screwed up.
[9612.60s -> 9616.92s]  You'll always need to test things out in play mode. I can't- I can't jump to
[9616.92s -> 9621.48s]  this. Bad design.
[9621.48s -> 9627.08s]  Then select play mode with X. Its icon looks like a controller.
[9627.08s -> 9634.92s]  I know. Once you're in play mode. Oh dear. Looks like it's too far for
[9634.92s -> 9639.32s]  Connie. Move that first platform closer. Yep.
[9639.32s -> 9643.88s]  To do that, head back into edit mode.
[9643.96s -> 9647.72s]  Pull this over here. Open the options menu and select the button with the
[9647.72s -> 9651.96s]  pencil icon. Move this back. That looks good. Once
[9651.96s -> 9655.64s]  you're in edit mode, move on to the next step. I can go
[9655.64s -> 9662.58s]  like this. Rotate. Sit you back here. Is that good?
[9662.58s -> 9669.11s]  Looks all right. Sort of. Yeah, that's fine.
[9669.11s -> 9672.55s]  And then this one has to be grown. Look, I'm gonna see if I can figure
[9672.55s -> 9676.87s]  it out on my own, right? And then, so for instance,
[9676.87s -> 9695.16s]  resize. Makes sense. That. Okay. It's a little- it's a little
[9695.16s -> 9699.08s]  tilted, but that's fine. All right. Now let's play this. I'm
[9699.08s -> 9700.60s]  gonna play the video. We're gonna do it fast.
[9700.60s -> 9707.70s]  Ready? We have to do something about these platforms.
[9707.70s -> 9711.14s]  Move your view side onto Connie and the first pink platform
[9711.14s -> 9716.87s]  strafe up and down. The imp has this equipped by default.
[9716.87s -> 9723.64s]  Move tool. Move it where you- I moved it. Over so it lines up with the pink. Yep. R2.
[9723.64s -> 9727.32s]  Use the left stick to move the platform back. Yeah. By pressing the
[9727.56s -> 9732.92s]  directional button. Okay. That's because their auto guide gadget.
[9732.92s -> 9739.24s]  Wait, wait, wait. Auto guide gadget. What is that?
[9739.24s -> 9742.92s]  You may have noticed that objects move more freely here in edit mode than in
[9742.92s -> 9746.04s]  the home space. That's because their auto guide
[9746.04s -> 9749.16s]  gadgets are disabled by default in the guides menu.
[9749.16s -> 9753.40s]  Okay, well fine. I'll explain more about this in another tutorial. But for
[9753.40s -> 9755.96s]  now, you don't need to worry about it.
[9755.96s -> 9759.48s]  It just means you have more freedom to dream shape.
[9759.48s -> 9767.80s]  when the platform is in the right spot you're ready for the next step okay and that next step is to
[9767.80s -> 9778.71s]  play it now that the first platform's in position let's all right hold on hold on guys i'm gonna
[9778.71s -> 9784.09s]  level with you here because i have to do these it's probably gonna take at least three it's
[9784.09s -> 9788.25s]  probably gonna take at least two or three hours to do these tutorials right so here's the plan
[9788.25s -> 9793.61s]  okay here's what's gonna happen i am going to i'm going to do the tutorial off stream
[9794.17s -> 9807.74s]  because this is probably going to be a solid like two plus maybe three hours to do this all
[9810.42s -> 9818.22s]  so here's the here's the deal i'm gonna go p i'm gonna play this tomorrow we're gonna make
[9818.22s -> 9823.56s]  something tomorrow when i turn the stream off tonight i'm gonna do all these i'm gonna spend
[9823.56s -> 9827.56s]  like four whatever three four five plus hours doing it and then we're gonna make something
[9827.56s -> 9836.92s]  and i'm gonna have all the knowledge i'm going to be prepared completely so tomorrow we will
[9837.56s -> 9843.00s]  play the creation portion of dreams for the remainder of today because it's been about
[9843.00s -> 9863.56s]  three hours we can either go back and do some more dreams change over to sam and max finish
[9863.56s -> 9874.12s]  that third episode but you will see a i'm going to be making stuff tomorrow okay i'll
[9874.12s -> 9881.14s]  give you a poll because i can definitely foresee that this is going to take a large chunk of
[9881.14s -> 9889.06s]  time and i know people don't really want to watch tutorials maybe you do but i'd rather just come
[9889.06s -> 9894.18s]  and have a bunch of stuff to have for you tomorrow you know what i mean we'll see and may
[9894.18s -> 9910.46s]  i could be wrong here so let's find out i'm gonna put a poll in the chat i'll give you
[9910.46s -> 9930.50s]  some good options okay here we go i am extraordinarily excited for this game but i want to
[9930.50s -> 9937.53s]  know what i'm doing there you go i am gonna just go p i'm gonna take my first break
[9938.25s -> 10229.77s]  we'll see what you guys want to do i will be right back stay tuned all right hey how are we
[10229.77s -> 10246.71s]  doing uh we are a bit too close to call right here 400 to within one percent
[10265.61s -> 10272.55s]  goddamn tutorial voters three all right this is this i might have to just remove the tutorials
[10272.55s -> 10288.07s]  one then but it's just the top two because if that this is within that this is within six
[10288.07s -> 10297.56s]  this is within six votes maybe you'd be inclined to vote for sam and max or surfing if you didn't
[10297.56s -> 10305.98s]  want me to do these tutorials i don't know all right let's eliminate the tutorials then
[10306.62s -> 10316.58s]  you guys you guys are always happy you guys always do this it's too close
[10318.65s -> 10333.11s]  it's four like look at this 427 428 430 to 430 do you see how close this is every time
[10333.11s -> 10339.03s]  look at this the division here all right new poll we're getting rid of tutorials
[10344.25s -> 10353.56s]  and this is it i'm gonna call this i'm gonna call this dream surfing or salmon max you know
[10353.56s -> 10377.13s]  what they are the title is required oh shit there you go this one's not gonna be as long
[10377.13s -> 10387.16s]  this one's gonna be like less than two minutes germa lied about minecraft vr thanks for the
[10387.16s -> 10402.76s]  five community subs thank you because right now if i go back i'm looking at the first poll
[10408.57s -> 10424.04s]  the first poll has 42 to 41 percent not the tie i'm gonna i'm gonna finish sam and max episode
[10424.04s -> 10438.09s]  three so don't worry i'm gonna do the whole season another five community subs for germa
[10438.09s -> 10442.49s]  lied about ace attorney i don't these are a bunch of things that i haven't lied about
[10442.49s -> 10451.19s]  why don't i just make sam and max in dreams all right i'm closing this in 10 seconds
[10453.61s -> 10459.58s]  it looks like by a very small amount we are going to stay in dreams we're going to dream
[10459.58s -> 10469.16s]  surf for a little while longer going back to the first poll dream surfing did win this poll here
[10469.16s -> 10475.48s]  it is currently sitting at 460 to 449 in favor of do more surfing so it looks like on both
[10475.48s -> 10498.18s]  poles dream surfing has won even with the removal of the tutorials all right so we're
[10498.18s -> 10516.28s]  gonna go dream surfing but i'm supposed to be almost by the same amount too it won both
[10516.28s -> 10525.70s]  poles by yeah all right let's back it up and those of you that really want to see sam and
[10525.70s -> 10534.79s]  max do not worry sam and max is going to it'll probably be the day after tomorrow i will probably
[10534.79s -> 10543.74s]  do sam and max on wednesday it's just what you wanted to see right this second so let's do some
[10543.74s -> 10559.74s]  more surfing people that wanted the tutorial also wanted dreams that's true but that dream
[10559.74s -> 10567.74s]  surfing did technically win that first poll so it didn't really matter all right i'm gonna
[10567.74s -> 10582.39s]  get out of here let's go back and let's dream surf this time i'm gonna actually look at some
[10582.39s -> 10594.95s]  of these because they're instead of doing the auto one battle tops haunted mansion so this is
[10594.95s -> 10602.44s]  an entire story with the thing in the top right mean how many scenes it has and what does that
[10602.44s -> 10623.72s]  mean the second one dogs run solid gears are metal with a car drift jump souls do you
[10623.72s -> 10629.24s]  accept the challenge this is nothing for non-dark this is nothing for non-dark souls player

[10685.66s -> 10690.97s]  did this say this was easy for dark souls players or hard for dark souls players
[10692.78s -> 10700.38s]  this is hard for non-dark souls players right but how does this have to do with dark souls
[10700.46s -> 10730.39s]  oh fuck did i get it on the internet for saving us the internet's dying no

[11416.78s -> 11425.38s]  boomer game this is not a boomer game this is the shit that kids were playing at their desk
[11425.38s -> 11433.29s]  in middle school like less than five to ten years ago a boomer game kids were getting like
[11433.29s -> 11439.74s]  in trouble in school because of this game guys boomers that implies boomers know how to
[11439.74s -> 11454.55s]  use their phones or any device that's electronically powered no this is like this is like an early
[11454.55s -> 11470.07s]  millennial i mean like late millennial zoomer right yes yes it is the boomer equivalent of

[11515.32s -> 11523.02s]  hurdle wars a nod at the classic button mashing olympic style game stop killing my
[11523.02s -> 11531.32s]  internet god i go i take like a vacation and i come back and then it's worse than ever
[11544.28s -> 11553.51s]  hurdle wars and this is a button masher i can do it pretty well why did i move somewhere
[11553.51s -> 11558.31s]  with such data internet internet is awful across the entire country of the united states the
[11558.31s -> 11564.09s]  united states has just shitty it doesn't matter where you go everybody complains about it
[11564.09s -> 11571.53s]  internet's terrible everywhere there's like four internet companies in america all of them suck
[11572.09s -> 11579.98s]  they're all terrible there's cox spectrum comcast and like century link there's like four
[11579.98s -> 11586.90s]  companies in the whole entire country pick which one they're all awful it doesn't matter where
[11586.90s -> 11595.38s]  you go this and there's like google fiber in like four places or verizon verizon files in
[11595.38s -> 11610.76s]  like three places but that's the thing about internet right here so let's let's do the
[11610.76s -> 11615.02s]  internet rant here i sometimes you see people that say what are you talking about my internet's
[11615.02s -> 11620.38s]  fine i mean you but you're probably not noticing it right so what you get to see when you watch
[11620.38s -> 11628.70s]  like a stream is a live feed of how bad their internet is it's just a consistent online feed
[11628.70s -> 11634.58s]  of that person's internet there's no way to tell how bad or slow your internet could be
[11634.58s -> 11640.34s]  running sometimes because i mean my internet's still on i could go to a website right now
[11640.34s -> 11649.38s]  just fine but the way that it goes through the cables and to the plant and out to the nodes
[11649.94s -> 11668.81s]  and i think i think i'm off i think i think it turned off so it's it's not how do i jump
[11672.68s -> 11684.54s]  what's okay l1 is jump i'm going as fast as i can possibly go i can only go 10 i can't go
[11684.54s -> 11718.26s]  higher than 10 does this end i did it eight penalties that's not bad like speed does not
[11718.26s -> 11723.38s]  mean stability and that's the problem american internet it's actually you know fairly fast
[11724.26s -> 11731.21s]  but it's not stable really anywhere you go some people luck out some people get really
[11731.21s -> 11740.73s]  really really stable internet most people have at some point issues with stability
[11740.73s -> 11762.36s]  oh pinball i want to try this oh this is awesome i want to make my own can i shake it i don't think
[11762.36s -> 11781.06s]  i can tilt it real boomer game yeah you just bring like 40 dollars and quarters to the arcade
[11781.78s -> 11797.24s]  it's so cool you can even do this though i wonder what kind of just weird workarounds
[11797.24s -> 11806.52s]  you have to do just to get this to work sure it's fun all right that was cool let's

[16690.55s -> 16699.59s]  you're not very good at bowling actually i am not good at bowling at all bowling for me is
[16699.59s -> 16705.86s]  mini golf and i'll explain myself they're the only two sports the only two activities on earth
[16706.66s -> 16718.60s]  that enrage me they enrage the fuck out of me i don't know why i'll go mini golfing and it's
[16718.60s -> 16724.12s]  i start out fine and everything's just dandy and i'm having a good time and i will i will go
[16724.12s -> 16734.07s]  over i will get like 12 strokes on one hole and want to leave i will bowl and i will
[16734.07s -> 16736.87s]  gutter ball twice or something or three times in a row and i'll just be like i don't even
[16736.87s -> 16748.46s]  fucking want to be here i hate this something about it i don't know what it is mini golf and
[16748.46s -> 16753.10s]  bowling both really pissed me off i think you know with bowling i think it's like the real time
[16753.10s -> 16759.24s]  score that's up on the screen so people will know how bad you are i used to like it back
[16759.24s -> 16764.84s]  in the day they had the thing on the table it wasn't up on a big screen people can walk
[16764.84s -> 16770.20s]  by and look at your screen and see oh like the funny name you put up like hot dog right
[16772.04s -> 16781.83s]  has like 34 points it's embarrassing by the way the only reason why i said the word hot dog
[16782.39s -> 16789.35s]  is because we were just a hot dog on the screen what do you mean no one looks at that i do
[16790.07s -> 16797.18s]  when i walk by i and i always hate when they put you next to the fucking good bowlers
[16797.90s -> 16805.99s]  i walk around i i request a lane i walk up and down i look okay there's two here
[16806.79s -> 16810.95s]  there's one in between two other uh parties bowling and you look at their screen they're
[16810.95s -> 16817.51s]  at like 180 200 average i don't want to be next to that person it'll be that would embarrass me
[16818.41s -> 16822.52s]  i will gutter ball three times in a row and watch them hit strikes and it's just like move
[16822.52s -> 16837.93s]  me i don't want to be there 200 isn't good what what are you what planet are you talking
[16837.93s -> 16848.54s]  about 200 is great imagine being insecure about bowling no it's just bowling in mini golf
[16848.54s -> 16851.98s]  because mini golf the same thing happens somebody two people will go in front of you
[16852.86s -> 16859.02s]  and they're they'll get like a birdie it's like a birdie sick man oh nice man my turn oh cool my
[16859.02s -> 16866.73s]  turn everyone watch me now i i thought i missed it's okay i can i get it in i can get it enough
[16867.62s -> 16873.94s]  now i went over a lot in way too much like it was terrible hold on i can still get parts okay
[16874.82s -> 16878.68s]  everyone's sitting there with their arms crossed waiting for you to finish you knock
[16878.68s -> 16883.56s]  it back you miss again and once you get to four or five strokes you start to do the thing where
[16883.56s -> 16888.12s]  you drag the fucking ball around and just drag it into the hole angry just because people want
[16888.12s -> 16908.74s]  to play speaking of which why am i still here that was fun if you don't like people seeing
[16908.74s -> 16918.78s]  how bad you are then why are you a streamer what do you mean i'm not i'm not bad did you beat
[16918.78s -> 16926.42s]  sick hero yet i did that like two weeks ago i died i beat the real true final boss in secure
[16927.38s -> 16931.46s]  how can i be bad at the game and still do that it's impossible beat secure on stream dark souls
[16931.46s -> 16936.76s]  three on stream you know the fucking joke i don't even say it chef versus chocolate from space
[16936.76s -> 16943.82s]  kind of need to play this one you always get high scores at all the wrong things
[16944.62s -> 16968.65s]  what does that mean look at how cute this is what i have to do secure is not even that
[16968.65s -> 16974.50s]  hard i mean yo look you you can say that if you want but secure started like a massive
[16974.50s -> 16997.93s]  debate about how hard video games are somebody tuned the piano for the love of god somebody
[16997.93s -> 17011.45s]  tuned the piano that's the funniest comment all night how do you tune a piano can you even tune a
[17011.45s -> 17017.34s]  piano okay is it weird let me tell you guys something it's not like fucking weird thing about

[17039.78s -> 17047.03s]  weird about it those strings are so tight every time i had roommates in college that would play
[17047.03s -> 17051.67s]  the guitar i've had friends i had guitars and you would they'd pick it up and they'd tune it
[17052.31s -> 17058.15s]  and it would be like like it's getting so taught it's gonna snap and it's gonna hurt them
[17058.15s -> 17074.54s]  i had to get up and leave speaking of leaving i would see them just sitting on the couch and
[17074.54s -> 17085.51s]  it'd be like and that's when i get up and like i think it's gonna break it's gonna hurt them
[17085.51s -> 17094.55s]  same thing with the piano it's just really tight strings tight wait didn't we already do
[17094.55s -> 17114.52s]  this one you are not supposed to be here bald wizard okay fine that sounds like a good one
[17114.52s -> 17120.74s]  also you guys know about the balloon thing i'm scared of balloons look i will be the first
[17120.74s -> 17129.08s]  person in line at the haunted house i will do all kinds of scary dangerous shit but if you blow
[17129.08s -> 17141.22s]  up a balloon in the room that i'm in i'm going to leave the room you could fill a room with
[17141.22s -> 17145.22s]  cockroaches and i would roll around in the ground and be like this is fun this is nothing
[17145.22s -> 17156.55s]  there's nothing nothing a problem here you could bury me in sand up to my mouth and like have
[17156.55s -> 17160.23s]  to tie like i i would be fine i'd be like ah this is kind of weird i'm like but this is
[17160.23s -> 17171.08s]  like you'll dig me out eventually right i would like jump i would like i would go like skydiving
[17172.54s -> 17181.67s]  no you blow a balloon up in the room i'm sorry i have to leave it's that the balloons blown
[17182.31s -> 17194.28s]  this is the story of bald wizard his only goal in life to grow some hair he has tried
[17194.28s -> 17203.58s]  everything he can done vast amounts of research read many books but he could not find a way
[17203.58s -> 17213.85s]  to get his hair to grow that is until he found out about the gem of hair a magical stone said
[17213.85s -> 17222.25s]  to grow hair anywhere one desires the only problem is the bald wizard has no idea where
[17222.25s -> 17231.48s]  it is located he makes his way to a village he's never been to before he decides the best
[17231.48s -> 17238.12s]  place to find answers would be in a tavern so he makes his way towards the tavern
[17239.16s -> 17247.16s]  as he gets ready to begin his journey in search of the magical stone that will help him achieve
[17247.16s -> 17257.69s]  the one goal he has in life to grow some hair this is the beginning of a long journey
[17258.17s -> 17274.38s]  so okay we're in the bald wizard things don't scare me like haunted houses scary things don't
[17274.38s -> 17284.01s]  scare me a clown could be in a dark room my lights in my bedroom could be off and
[17284.01s -> 17289.82s]  there could be a clown in there with a huge long face blood coming out of his eyes and
[17289.82s -> 17293.18s]  two knives in his hands and he walks up and goes right in my face while i'm dead asleep and

[19259.91s -> 19266.38s]  waiting and looking and trying to find out well no never mind this is called chinese
[19266.38s -> 19290.14s]  new year at the temple just fucking dropped it's a wallpaper it's nice all this is crafted
[19290.14s -> 19318.01s]  this is this is beautiful fireworks go off that's cool treasure hunt collect all this
[19318.01s -> 19328.63s]  is probably a pretty oh i thought that was ice what i was gonna say is this is probably a template
[19329.85s -> 19336.33s]  that a lot of people do for their first game maybe it's just easy to do the run around and
[19336.33s -> 19351.05s]  collect stuff how do i get unlock more coins yeah i'm gonna put time into this i'm gonna
[19351.05s -> 19362.60s]  give it at least one real shot we're gonna have a giant viewing experience those of you that also
[19362.60s -> 19368.63s]  have dreams and you want to make something and maybe we'll play it tomorrow because tomorrow
[19368.63s -> 19373.50s]  is the creation day this was just stick around and see people have made maybe we'll make a
[19373.50s -> 19379.98s]  certain tag that you can put on the your creation right like the edges like germa dash
[19379.98s -> 19385.64s]  something or story of whatever it is it'd probably be easier to do it that way so i can
[19385.64s -> 19407.86s]  just search for germa right this is a neon part two is it gonna have vr support it's only 2.4 gigs
[19410.94s -> 19423.59s]  yeah they really condensed it down what give people time to build stuff well look uh okay
[19423.59s -> 19430.30s]  let me be completely honest and not joke around here uh i'm gonna do a bunch of
[19430.30s -> 19437.69s]  shit tonight and i'm gonna try to show something tomorrow but if it's very clear that it takes a
[19437.69s -> 19444.01s]  very long time to do anything then maybe i will just say hey in like a week we're gonna do like a
[19444.01s -> 19458.78s]  green screen part two green screen movie night part two but it's dreams and give a tag yeah
[19458.78s -> 19463.50s]  i would just do it just a hashtag germa or have germa being your title or something
[19464.30s -> 19491.53s]  what the hell is a roller coaster that's cool there's no more track is this the end
[19491.53s -> 19514.17s]  do we just fall off neon part three whoa what the hell oh i i revealed the cool game mechanic
[19514.17s -> 19544.90s]  before i was supposed to what is this can i pick this up i'm not exactly sure what i'm looking
[19544.90s -> 19554.36s]  for here but maybe i'll find it i guess not portrait i'm gonna draw a bunch of shit too
[19554.36s -> 19568.81s]  i think we already saw this one yeah wait we already did this another roller coaster
[19577.62s -> 19579.22s]  this has to be by the same person right
[19589.03s -> 19614.50s]  oh okay that was pretty cool wow neon part four is that me that's me doing what i did earlier
[19615.22s -> 19637.98s]  anything else i can do can i go through the window we could have watched all the tutorials
[19637.98s -> 19645.64s]  by now no way and plus here's the thing there's a diff well this is there's a
[19645.64s -> 19649.56s]  difference between watching tutorials for three hours and enjoying a content that people have
[19649.56s -> 19656.98s]  made also these tutorials are pretty in-depth and i'm going to assume it's probably gonna
[19656.98s -> 19662.70s]  take about three hours to do most of them i also want to understand them too somebody made a good
[19662.70s -> 19667.96s]  point where this is really cool uh somebody made a really good point that if i do tutorials
[19667.96s -> 19673.96s]  on stream it's kind of just i sit there quiet while i focus on how to play the game for
[19673.96s -> 19683.53s]  three or four hours so i'm just gonna do it off stream purple pants beta celebration dance
[19684.33s -> 19730.84s]  who is god i would call this unsettling that was it that's the whole thing time corruption
[19731.64s -> 19737.50s]  time has been stopped to prevent further damage agent intervention required one find the time
[19737.50s -> 19743.42s]  control bracelet activate the power nodes enter into the powered singularity to restart the time
[19744.54s -> 19759.82s]  take control of the agent maybe there'll be checkpoints right next what are these checkpoints
[19759.82s -> 19787.00s]  for not tron i like the design of the floors it's almost like made of chalk found the time
[19787.00s -> 19805.56s]  bracelet forward in time oh okay let's see what it's doing very cool oh never mind all right
[19807.66s -> 19837.21s]  wait what's this so close them up okay back here flip them hey look at that in this one
[19838.01s -> 19844.06s]  i wonder when you actually know how to do everything and use the tools correctly i wonder
[19844.06s -> 19850.60s]  how long it takes to make something i guess it really depends on what you want to do you can
[19850.60s -> 19860.97s]  probably do dancing uh disco diaper guy oh god damn it you probably do that in like 30 or 40
[19860.97s -> 19883.38s]  minutes a day of work yeah let's see what i can do oh god how many more of these are there
[19897.27s -> 19898.63s]  i'm not controlling this
[19899.35s -> 19915.19s]  okay lovecraftian horror intro the most merciful thing in the world is the inability
[19915.19s -> 19932.58s]  of the human mind to correlate all its contents as by hp lovecraft that's it that was the intro
[19932.58s -> 19939.42s]  it's a nice snow scene i'm gonna get addicted to this game and want to make all kinds of

[19968.31s -> 19975.67s]  big planet with like 10 000 times more content you can make everything you can make in little
[19975.67s -> 19979.83s]  big planets
[19983.40s -> 20014.89s]  fuck anybody said i'm not sure i can go anywhere i believe this is a tech demo in the building i
[20014.89s -> 20038.78s]  guess so well maybe we'll see what it is it's like clay but not clay it's a clay and wood
[20038.78s -> 20067.35s]  together whoa here's the outro small glimpse of what's to come follow if you wish to discover

[21815.16s -> 21835.13s]  me i think it's huge this is a good one boss told me to dispose of the key to the server
[21835.13s -> 21839.99s]  room guess he doesn't want anyone opening the lock to 211 more of his obsession to make sure
[21839.99s -> 21844.15s]  no one destroys his little experiment i'm over at the stench permeating for this place's foul

[22067.62s -> 22091.14s]  lot of errors press play on the movie we're watching it so wait hold on i think that may
[22091.14s -> 22108.63s]  that may have been it gone rogue maybe there's more is it just playing again i think it's repeating

[23506.90s -> 23514.26s]  50 earlier i missed it but thank you for the 50 bucks it's a lot of money they say hey germa
[23514.26s -> 23521.70s]  donated a month ago during securo but somebody one guy got mad at my name and reported me
[23522.34s -> 23528.89s]  so i got banned for 30 days here's some bits back keep up the great stream
[23531.40s -> 23534.92s]  wait hold on if you got banned for 30 days how do you still have the name
[23537.70s -> 23549.96s]  they've banned you for 30 days but they let you keep the name that seems a little odd
[23551.91s -> 23562.58s]  well uh that doesn't make that doesn't make very much sense but thank you for the 50 dollars it's
[23562.58s -> 23577.08s]  a lot of money and you got refunded for the bits maybe he's still banned i don't think so
[23579.46s -> 23586.90s]  but thank you so much for the money that's a lot of money where's the donate option
[23586.90s -> 23595.14s]  uh i don't do paypal donations or anything bits or subs i don't do the paypal thing
[23596.10s -> 23607.86s]  but thank you thank you tyler mike for the 250 hey germa last stream i mentioned that
[23607.86s -> 23611.94s]  vinnie had complimented you and it seemed like you hadn't seen the clip so here you go it's
[23611.94s -> 23618.34s]  very wholesome also if you watch it make sure to watch the entire clip uh i think we have seen
[23618.34s -> 23623.53s]  this one vinnie i'm sure someone already told you but one of his favorite streamers
[23624.57s -> 23630.92s]  i hear germa's doing an ama at the moment so i want to pay back the compliment i don't
[23631.00s -> 23634.60s]  watch a lot of live streams i watch more youtube videos these days
[23635.72s -> 23642.84s]  but germa is one of my favorite people i've ever met that does what i do and he's also
[23642.84s -> 23646.92s]  one of my favorite streamers he's also drunk okay he probably won't mean that
[23648.44s -> 23649.64s]  no i do i did
[23652.12s -> 23660.95s]  no i do i really do mean that so anyway goodbye for now you can't preface you can't be like
[23660.95s -> 23666.95s]  oh he's drunk though i was genuinely upset when germa was not at pax this year as stupid as that
[23666.95s -> 23670.79s]  may sound but he's a really good dude we get along it's a new york boston thing i think
[23671.51s -> 23680.02s]  no i think he's great now how come i because i had a few drinks all of a sudden that negates
[23680.02s -> 23694.52s]  literally everything i said now i stand by it i mean i meant it you've ruined his pax
[23694.52s -> 23703.78s]  experience well i'm sorry i just couldn't i couldn't go this year but thank you tyler

[23808.71s -> 23815.10s]  sorry to hear that it's a really really annoying illness uh the best advice i could
[23815.10s -> 23823.26s]  give to somebody that gets diagnosed with colitis is to have a a more basic diet for a little while
[23824.30s -> 23832.30s]  and kind of start introducing foods again to see what kind of throws you off what
[23833.02s -> 23836.94s]  makes you feel better it's hard to tell if you just kind of keep eating the same things
[23836.94s -> 23851.22s]  you normally eat but they've come uh they've come pretty far with the whole colitis and
[23851.22s -> 23860.36s]  medicine and there are things that can really keep people in remission for a while i'm sorry
[23860.36s -> 23873.99s]  to hear that though hopefully hopefully um she can manage it thanks to the 250 i missed another
[23873.99s -> 23879.03s]  fifth what how did i miss this many oh i know why it's because my uh playstation 4 audio is
