[1.27s -> 10.71s]  Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. Just realized that my Wiimote doesn't have a strap.
[11.43s -> 24.04s]  Physically, it doesn't. I don't have one. Why? Where did it go? I gotta be careful. Don't want
[24.04s -> 36.86s]  to put a hole in my monitor's head. He's not using protection. Unsafe? That's unsafe. It's not that
[36.86s -> 42.54s]  unsafe. As long as you don't play a game that requires you to, like, throw or move really
[42.54s -> 51.70s]  quickly. And the only movements in No More Heroes are you just shake. You know, I, if, do you need
[51.70s -> 63.61s]  a strap for a salt shaker or a pepper shaker? No. That'd be kind of odd. That's the same motion
[63.61s -> 71.00s]  that I'm doing in this game. Anyways, we're going to continue No More Heroes. We're probably going
[71.00s -> 77.50s]  to get to the end tonight. Pepper shakers have a thick base. This is, like, as heavy as a pepper
[77.50s -> 88.70s]  shaker is. We are currently rank six assassin level. Climb in the ladder. And then tomorrow
[90.30s -> 97.69s]  is New Year's Eve. Tomorrow, we'll be doing a little bit of festivities. We'll be dropping
[97.69s -> 107.46s]  the ball Eastern time, not Pacific time. Remember, that's important. It's gonna be weird, though. I
[107.46s -> 114.90s]  think I did this last year, too. It was, like, 8.59 p.m. And I'm like, here we go, Ted! No, it's, like,
[115.30s -> 129.42s]  it's 9 o'clock, where I am. But we'll do that tomorrow. He's gonna drop his balls. I knew that
[129.42s -> 136.74s]  I was gonna show up somewhere. I just didn't know when. Do a countdown for every time zone in the
[136.74s -> 148.82s]  world. I'm not doing that. Winks are scams. Purple gang, rise up. Well, you just dropped 1200
[148.82s -> 154.47s]  channel points. You could have saved to get to 75,000 and got me to turn my camera on and wink.
[155.43s -> 161.61s]  That's too bad. All right, let's get going. Let me just give me one second. I'll be
[162.81s -> 165.86s]  here. I'll be here. I'm just moving something around. Maybe one second.
[186.36s -> 189.72s]  Yeah, that's true. Somebody just mentioned. When is the first New Year?
[191.16s -> 205.26s]  Australia? When is the first 2020? Somewhere in Australia? New Zealand? It's in New Zealand. All
[205.26s -> 213.90s]  right. So when? When? Or, like, I mean, like, relative to, like, hours from now, when is it
[213.90s -> 230.09s]  2020 for the first place? First time? It already happened. No, it didn't. New Year's is first
[230.09s -> 239.19s]  celebrated on the small island nations of Tonga. Okay. Well, happy. When is it? Let's see. I'm
[239.19s -> 248.42s]  gonna say, I'm gonna look up what time is it in Tonga right now. Tonga time. It is 102 p.m. Yeah,
[248.42s -> 257.11s]  it's 1 p.m. December 31st. Okay. We might be live when the first ever 2020 happens. It might be
[257.11s -> 264.46s]  possible. No, we won't. I'm not gonna be live in 12 hours. What the fuck am I talking about?
[267.02s -> 273.38s]  Oh, yeah, we're gonna be live in 12 hours. No way. That's not happening. It ain't gonna take
[273.38s -> 282.79s]  me that long to finish. No more heroes. Maybe six to seven. All right. Welcome back. Let's play with
[282.79s -> 285.59s]  Kat. Those of you that weren't here yesterday, this is the most important thing in the game.
[286.39s -> 305.94s]  Hold on. This is a one-guy scenario. I need to read this. Jerma, how do you describe a streamer
[305.94s -> 318.60s]  to someone who doesn't understand anything about the internet? Um, it was like four in a row.
[322.54s -> 326.14s]  Okay, I feel like I'm playing Battlefield right now. What the fuck was that?
[326.86s -> 343.43s]  So, uh, what are you doing? What? Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. Dude, um, Freddy,
[344.15s -> 363.85s]  Freddy, you gave 23,000 bits last night, and now you've dropped 75,000 bits right now. That's
[365.14s -> 376.58s]  a fucking hundred thousand bits in not even 12, 24 hours. You madman. Holy shit. That's a
[376.58s -> 389.83s]  thousand dollars in bits. Funding for the 2020 carnival. Freddy dreads. Seriously. Holy fuck,
[389.83s -> 394.47s]  man. That's ridiculous. They say, happy new year's Jerma. Thank you for making this year
[394.47s -> 405.78s]  hilarious for me. Freddy dread gaming. Holy shit, man. That's, all right, so that was so
[405.78s -> 410.10s]  ridiculous. This is fucking crazy right now. Somebody just said that wasn't even a car,
[410.10s -> 421.99s]  that was a weed whacker. Um, thank you. Seriously, uh, Shazzo just dropped 20 community subs
[421.99s -> 430.97s]  also. That was a tiny car, huge bits. Uh, Shazzo 20 community subs and fucking Freddy with,
[431.61s -> 437.61s]  that's, I think that's one of the biggest drops of money I've ever seen on stream ever in one drop.
[437.61s -> 442.65s]  We've had during the thing was another scenario where there was like five, six, seven hundred
[442.65s -> 451.02s]  dollars worth of bits that would drop. It's fucking, this is unbelievable. Thank you. Happy
[451.02s -> 464.36s]  new year to you as well. Let's hope 2020 is, um, interesting as well. That's a lot of money. That
[464.36s -> 492.28s]  deserves a wink. You know what? It sure does. What was that frame? What was that? I think that was,
[492.28s -> 503.24s]  that was, that wasn't, I wasn't naked. Hey, I can't wink. I know you just, that's, thank you.
[504.46s -> 524.02s]  75,000 bits equals 75,000 channel points. Give me my bike. Can somebody, was you in a tank top
[524.02s -> 530.17s]  looking at the camera? Can you clip that? Somebody show me what, I want to see like when that was.
[530.17s -> 535.86s]  Was that from yesterday? No, it couldn't have been. Oh, I know what it was. I know what it was.
[535.86s -> 545.46s]  I know what it was. Oh, fucking God damn it. Uh, okay. So I'm going to let me explain what happened.
[545.46s -> 552.58s]  Okay. This is very important. Um, that was from earlier today. That was, look at the hair. I'll
[552.58s -> 564.63s]  get it on stream. That was, uh, so earlier this day I got, I got out of the shower
[565.59s -> 570.79s]  and I said, Oh, okay. It's time. Let me set up my stream. Let me get like started here. Sounds good.
[577.00s -> 584.20s]  And I turned on the cam. I was setting the camera up and I realized, uh, I'm wearing the same shirt
[584.20s -> 592.14s]  that I was wearing yesterday, the same tank top. So I, um, I was like, people are going to talk shit
[592.14s -> 597.58s]  about this. They're going to be like, Oh, you in the same clothes as yesterday. And I'm just like,
[598.38s -> 603.34s]  yeah, uh, I have to tie hats. I just, I took off my shirt and put on another shirt.
[604.55s -> 615.30s]  That's what happened. But I got exposed anyways. So there you go. What the fuck is going on with
[615.30s -> 625.85s]  70? What the 75? What is happening today? Oh, God damn it. No, no, not God damn like
[628.18s -> 641.69s]  75. People are finding ways to circumvent that. All right. Uh, core monster. That's 75 subs.
[641.69s -> 655.26s]  You maniac. Holy shit. That is an unfucking believable guys. That's, that's too much money.
[658.06s -> 672.44s]  75 fucking subs from core monster right now. And 75,000 bits from Freddy. You guys are too,
[672.44s -> 680.34s]  you guys are too kind. You guys spoil me. I'm just going to spend it on McChickens.
[681.06s -> 692.78s]  That's going to buy a lot of pizzas. Well, it's, it's, I can't even believe it. I'm forever fucking
[692.78s -> 703.45s]  grateful that somebody would give this much money to this room. And, uh, hopefully, hopefully all
[703.45s -> 711.05s]  the money that comes into this channel, I can use it and try to make stuff that I think would be
[711.13s -> 715.53s]  interesting. That's pretty much what it is. Pay to link streamer.
[717.05s -> 724.62s]  Laugh my ass off. You call yourself a Jerma fan. I'm fucking loaded on channel points, bro.
[724.62s -> 739.08s]  Every message could wait one. Where is this by the way? All this for, uh, all this for a thousand
[739.08s -> 746.01s]  dollars. It's not even worth it. Try talking to chat again when you're a true fan. I highlight
[746.01s -> 756.38s]  every message because I just that jacked. Oh, I see. But yeah, that was a big,
[756.94s -> 766.87s]  huge money drops from a few people here. Um, hopefully I can get this stupid thing out of
[766.87s -> 774.60s]  the ground. Where? All right. Seriously, where is it? Why was my thing rumbling over there? What?
[781.43s -> 794.84s]  Holy shit. Freddy just gave 50. Is that person naked? Freddy just gave 50 community subs.
[796.04s -> 805.13s]  Wait there. What are they? Fuck their tier two. These are tier two. What the fuck is going on?
[806.89s -> 826.52s]  Holy shit. That's insane. 50 tier two community subs from Freddy.
[826.52s -> 838.10s]  Freddy Dread. You've got to be kidding me. I had a dream last night that Jerma literally. What?
[838.98s -> 851.19s]  What are you talking about? Or I have to. Why was that just in there? Why was that just in the part
[851.19s -> 869.93s]  of it? Like the chat. Why was that just in the chat? Oh, anyways, holy fuck, man. That's,
[869.93s -> 877.19s]  that's insane. Tier two. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. That's Freddy Dread. Thank
[877.19s -> 883.67s]  you, Freddy. Thank you. Evil program. Five subs. Collie Brady. Five subs. I had a dream. What was
[883.67s -> 898.63s]  it? I didn't. I didn't. Okay. I didn't like chill. I need to see. What the fuck? Go gaming. I had a
[898.63s -> 922.20s]  dream. What was it? Just somebody PM it to me. Don't PM me. I had a dream last night. Everyone was
[922.20s -> 941.32s]  cheering. That's so funny to me. Everyone was screaming TOS or cheering. What the fuck?
[946.10s -> 955.14s]  We didn't even start. I haven't even started streaming yet. Oh my God. Evil program. Five subs.
[955.14s -> 971.40s]  Collie Brady. Five subs. Produce. Produce. Imagine having that dream though. Like I can't imagine
[971.40s -> 982.18s]  having a dream like that. Produces. All right. Get it together. Produces. Produces. San. Thanks
[982.18s -> 992.66s]  for the five subs. Slonk. CR. Thanks for the five subs. Seriously, guys. Henry1810 gave five subs.
[996.70s -> 1005.93s]  Jesus. I had a dream. Oh my God. I can imagine waking up from that dream. I think that's one
[1005.93s -> 1010.57s]  of those dreams where you wake up afterward. After you, you look in the mirror and you just go like
[1011.61s -> 1018.01s]  why did I have that dream? Why did I have that dream? There's gotta be something. Like there's
[1018.01s -> 1036.15s]  gotta be a reason why I'm having a dream like that. Oh my God. He watches too much. Yeah but
[1036.15s -> 1040.07s]  all right. There's a difference between watching too much and then having a dream that I'm having
[1040.07s -> 1046.47s]  sex with somebody on stream. Why was the camera on? What are you having that dream for?
[1046.47s -> 1071.24s]  Dude, this is fucked. I have to just do this mission. Oh. This is killing me.
[1078.73s -> 1084.22s]  This is killing. I don't know why this is killing me. I don't. Okay. I know this is gonna sound
[1084.22s -> 1088.30s]  crazy because it's gonna be fucked. Just like. All right. Just mute if you. Oh but seriously.
[1088.30s -> 1093.58s]  Like I just picture. I just like. Oh you know like images that like you just. Like I just see the
[1093.58s -> 1101.10s]  chat and like the screen. Like it's. We're screen grabbing somebody's web browser and it's just
[1101.10s -> 1106.06s]  that's on the video player and there's a chat next to it and it's like all my like rules are underneath.
[1113.98s -> 1144.38s]  What is this one? What was this one? I don't even remember. Oh this one. Sometimes it seriously only
[1144.38s -> 1148.06s]  takes one thing that somebody says over here and it just fucks me up for the whole day.
[1149.02s -> 1154.30s]  I'm gonna be thinking about that all day. It's gonna pop up into my brain. I'm just. I'm a very
[1154.30s -> 1161.02s]  visual person. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm incredibly visual and I like. I will see the things
[1161.02s -> 1176.01s]  that people say up in my head and I'm gonna keep seeing that until tomorrow. Until it happens.
[1176.89s -> 1184.09s]  Okay I gotta relax.
[1185.45s -> 1191.30s]  Jesus Christ. We're good.
[1195.14s -> 1202.33s]  A lot of money from this one. Welcome back by the way to this is no more heroes.
[1202.33s -> 1204.97s]  It's been 20 minutes on stream. What the fuck has happened?
[1208.28s -> 1229.05s]  Is that it? One more. Did I get it? I didn't even see that. The video on the ground.
[1232.81s -> 1236.49s]  You got like a thousand dollars and then laughed at sex for 10 minutes. That's what's happened.
[1239.82s -> 1254.09s]  Yeah that about sums it up. You're right. That's pretty good recap. Oh there's a new job. There's
[1254.09s -> 1264.68s]  a new job. Can I still vote in the poll? Yes you can. If we can get the poll in the chat please.
[1265.40s -> 1269.16s]  Check it out. You have until tomorrow afternoon to vote.
[1270.92s -> 1283.34s]  Germa NYE 19 on Serbian Monkey. That's the one. What's the new job? Mine sweeping. Oh this is not
[1283.34s -> 1288.06s]  the scorpions yet. Clean up the mines buried in the beach. A bonus will be paid due to how
[1288.06s -> 1299.77s]  dangerous the work is. We're looking for high voter participation. Actually I think I can look
[1299.77s -> 1310.10s]  and see how many people have taken it so far. And like six cars drove by. A weed whacker drove by.
[1310.10s -> 1327.45s]  Like a bicycle. Like that was a weird first 10 minutes. Where do you vote on that survey monkey
[1327.45s -> 1342.63s]  page? Should be in the chat right now. Down to the beach. Let's do some mine sweeping. How much money
[1342.63s -> 1355.50s]  do we need? 350. The unspoken rules of Santa Destroy indicate danger. No one swims on the
[1355.50s -> 1360.46s]  beach here. There are military mines buried in the sand after all. The army used the beach for
[1360.46s -> 1365.34s]  testing out new maneuvers. You won't see any girls in bikinis and you'll need a metal detector to
[1365.34s -> 1370.78s]  avoid getting serious sunburn. What else would you expect in this place? No tourists. No sunbathe.
[1370.78s -> 1377.67s]  There's no logic. The god of landmines hates metal detectors. So work persistently. How does
[1377.67s -> 1386.33s]  this work? Safely remove the mines buried in the beach. Listen to your metal detector to locate
[1386.33s -> 1391.93s]  them. Then use your beam katana to destroy the mines. Do I need my the Wiimote thing?
[1398.49s -> 1401.77s]  Oh this. Where is it?
[1407.59s -> 1412.31s]  Where the hell is it? Oh it's it that's when I get when I get close enough.
[1412.31s -> 1437.40s]  I'm like insane. I'm insane. That scared the fuck out of me. That actually scared the shit out of
[1437.40s -> 1450.84s]  me. Jesus. Wow. He's a bad gamer. He's a bad gamer. He's not a very good gamer. He's a bad gamer.
[1451.48s -> 1478.65s]  I could change clothes too. Well where is it? How much are these worth? Because I only have three.
[1489.29s -> 1498.06s]  Holy shit. It's right here. It's two thousand per mine. That sucks. I have to pick up trash.
[1498.94s -> 1512.10s]  We gotta do each one once though. At close. Where is it?
[1515.06s -> 1519.19s]  What just happened? Boomer. Boomer. Boomer. He's a boomer.
[1527.11s -> 1530.46s]  It's gonna be 20,000. I'm gonna I'm gonna get a horrible grade.
[1531.50s -> 1538.95s]  This might be the first non-placing grade of the whole entire gameplay. This is not going to even
[1538.95s -> 1559.13s]  be bronze. I might not even place. You can't get below bronze? Really? Yeah this one kind of sucks.
[1560.02s -> 1563.14s]  I don't remember this one. Let me get 10. Let me get a clean 10.
[1564.66s -> 1570.34s]  Come on. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Come on. Come on. Come on. Just step on it.
[1570.34s -> 1583.08s]  Just step on it. Step on it. Step on it. T.O.S. What the fuck. T.O.S. dude. Yeah that one sucks.
[1585.30s -> 1594.26s]  20,000. Gold medal. I could pick up trash and make 60. Got another job for you. Something a little
[1594.26s -> 1608.86s]  shadier. Okay I just unlocked another assassin mission. Uh noodle is bad at gaming is the one
[1608.86s -> 1613.67s]  that had the dream. They said hey Jeremy glad I could make you laugh with that remark about my
[1613.67s -> 1618.63s]  dream. Laughing my ass off. I must say it had me pretty fucked up in the morning. Happy new year I
[1618.63s -> 1626.63s]  guess. I'm just happy that I was the one guy. Happy new. Happy new year I guess. Oh that means
[1626.63s -> 1638.98s]  it was hilarious. That was like a really funny thing to read. It was just outrageous. I guess.
[1643.10s -> 1647.42s]  Not eligible for funniest one guy moment unfortunately. Unfortunately.
[1652.90s -> 1655.78s]  Kill as many as you can within the time. Mission ends so just kill as many as you can.
[1656.26s -> 1679.27s]  3,000 per kill. I'll try it. It's at the beach. 2019 snub. You said how you're not going to get
[1679.27s -> 1683.91s]  this image out of your head until tomorrow. Try to imagine what it's like for them. They can't ever
[1683.91s -> 1706.36s]  watch a German stream the same way ever again. Uh this community is fucking hilarious. Sometimes
[1706.36s -> 1710.60s]  people think I'm like fucking I'm like kidding around when I say that or I'm like making it up.
[1711.56s -> 1723.50s]  There's just like so many things. Your viewers are fucked. I don't I don't know about that.
[1724.38s -> 1735.62s]  Jeremiah had 7.5k points. Please wink. No I'm sorry. That's not how it works.
[1738.47s -> 1741.75s]  I was hoping to like GTA style. Hit that and fly over into the beach.
[1742.97s -> 1754.81s]  But there's an invisible wall. I have 12k. Can you wink for me? Does it cost 12k or does it cost 75k?
[1754.81s -> 1773.38s]  Which one? He thinks this game is as good as GTA. Where's the entry here? Is it up? What?
[1774.10s -> 1781.78s]  Will you wink at 70 at the 75,000 bit guy's wedding?
[1786.42s -> 1794.98s]  I could have just. All right let's make some money. Let's make some fake money in game.
[1796.02s -> 1805.40s]  Kill as many as possible. Let's go. Do you guys all have guns?
[1805.72s -> 1814.84s]  There he is. Come on. My weapon's not good enough.
[1816.76s -> 1827.70s]  Let's bring it together. Was it 3,000 per kill? Already better than looking at the mines.
[1828.82s -> 1862.74s]  What Star Wars game is this? I don't know. We talked about that yesterday. Did I fight
[1862.74s -> 1872.98s]  Holly Summers yet? I did. That's the last thing I did last night. Hey.
[1873.62s -> 1898.65s]  Oh, the best thing in this game is when you get like seven people to stand in a row and you do the
[1898.65s -> 1918.58s]  side swipe and you hit every single one. It's so satisfying. I only have one person left.
[1919.54s -> 1932.84s]  That's it. 20? Nuts or chocolate? Nuts or chocolate? What do you mean nuts or chocolate?
[1932.84s -> 1948.65s]  Why do I have to pick? That's a lot of money. Why do I have to pick? You have to pick. I mean
[1948.65s -> 1953.22s]  nuts are healthier than chocolate, but I think chocolate's better than nuts. But you can't,
[1953.22s -> 1957.70s]  you know what I mean? Like I think chocolate is better than a nut, but nuts are healthier,
[1957.70s -> 1979.91s]  so I'd rather eat nuts more than I would eat chocolate. What? What? What's wrong with that?
[1985.58s -> 1993.37s]  No, all I'm saying is, all I'm saying is that chocolate is good. I like chocolate.
[1993.37s -> 1999.51s]  I like to eat chocolate, but chocolate doesn't, you don't have to eat chocolate every single day.
[1999.51s -> 2007.48s]  Okay? Nuts are healthy, but the thing about nuts is they can be a little salty. You know what I'm
[2007.48s -> 2012.90s]  saying? Nuts can be too salty. Too much so that you don't want to eat them. Chocolate is sweeter.
[2013.86s -> 2022.10s]  It's a little tastier, but I don't know. It depends. Actually, some restaurants do it better
[2022.10s -> 2027.85s]  than others. Chocolate from one restaurant versus chocolate from another restaurant. What I'm saying
[2027.85s -> 2036.31s]  is like what you like. I just fucking, I just, I just fucking hit a pulp. God damn it, guys.
[2060.10s -> 2069.18s]  In my defense, I simply just looked up car crash sound, like car, and I found this video,
[2069.18s -> 2072.46s]  and it's like car crash, and it's got, this thing's got fucking 1.6 million views,
[2073.51s -> 2078.79s]  and I'm sitting there waiting for the car crash sound to play, and it took 24 seconds to go by.
[2079.59s -> 2102.76s]  That's not, that sounded like a firework. Oh shit, my wee.
[2109.51s -> 2117.78s]  No, not my center bar. I didn't have my strap.
[2119.45s -> 2136.76s]  Fuck. Okay, let's go. Let's go. I have to play. I'm all twisted up right now. I'm,
[2136.76s -> 2156.78s]  I'm twisted up. I'm him. I'm twisted up today. I'm very twisted. Let's get a new,
[2160.98s -> 2179.00s]  let's get some new sunglasses. Okay. Black, pink, pink. Yeah. Get the Guy Fieri shades.
[2179.64s -> 2199.03s]  We'll do pink. Guy Fieri doesn't have pink shades. Ooh, ooh, I like that one.
[2202.50s -> 2208.79s]  The cobra? No, that's a, it's a lion. That's a cobra. I mean, that's very clearly a lion,
[2208.79s -> 2229.67s]  but look at that cobra face. This is too much money. Ooh, I actually like that look. Black and
[2229.67s -> 2248.57s]  white. Black and white with pink shades. I would wear this out. Wouldn't wear these out. Ooh,
[2258.30s -> 2263.64s]  this matches. But there's, boy, there's a hamburger one.
[2275.56s -> 2281.72s]  I love chainsaws. You say psycho, like it's a bad thing. Yep. That's the one. No, not yet.
[2282.68s -> 2298.65s]  Give me that one. I got, I gotta get the one that's hung up in every single college dormitory.
[2299.21s -> 2305.67s]  Like on the wall. It's like beer cans and shit all over the place. Oh yeah. What's that on the
[2305.67s -> 2318.68s]  wall? What's that plaque over there? That's good. Matches the shades. What about jeans? New pants?
[2333.40s -> 2348.57s]  Now, where the black jeans? Right there. I love a good pair of black jeans. They go with everything.
[2350.97s -> 2357.34s]  I'll keep my, no, these ones are ugly. I'm spending all my money. No, actually, I don't like these
[2357.34s -> 2383.02s]  jeans. Get them off. I mean, this looks bad, but who cares? All right. That's, I do, I do like the,
[2383.10s -> 2386.78s]  the rocket popsicle. That's what that is. What is it? Is it America or popsicle?
[2388.82s -> 2391.54s]  By the way, you can't, where do you get those now? You can't buy those anymore.
[2394.84s -> 2409.83s]  Colgate. Now I see rocket popsicle. Yeah, Colgate too. Yeah. These are at the dollar store.
[2413.42s -> 2428.87s]  Wow. You're a clown. Let's get a good look. It's not bad. Although I just spent all my money.
[2429.51s -> 2433.64s]  Let's do another assassin mission. Let, no, let me see if I can do some of these because look,
[2433.64s -> 2440.55s]  it's been 20, I can, I can do some of these, uh, free missions. We don't get hit. Go to the beer
[2440.55s -> 2449.85s]  icon. You got it. Dude, does German, is German one of those people that looks at chat? You got it.
[2449.85s -> 2471.93s]  I'm going in right now. I think I do have seven, a ball in return. Let me teach you something.
[2471.93s -> 2480.30s]  Select the technique that you want. Ooh. Memory of three displays the position of enemies on
[2480.86s -> 2489.19s]  the mini map. That's pretty good. Allows a jumping slash to be performed
[2490.15s -> 2505.30s]  by shaking the nunchuck. Also pretty good. Allow a dash to be performed by pressing B button.
[2505.94s -> 2519.78s]  I think I want that one. Memory of woman extends dark side mode. Time limit. All right. That's not
[2519.78s -> 2529.85s]  bad, but I, these are all increases the range of your grab. That's good too. Earn bonuses based
[2530.49s -> 2540.68s]  on your rank. What does that mean? Allows a jumping down attack. I'm going to do the dash.
[2543.53s -> 2547.69s]  This one I can dash with B. I feel like that's like a bloodborne dash, right?
[2548.33s -> 2552.47s]  Technically, or is it a sprint? We'll find out.
[2561.26s -> 2575.61s]  Learn the technique of Czar. You got that? I'm back. I'm really tired of the pre-recorded streams
[2575.61s -> 2580.18s]  lately. Honestly, I mean, appreciate the effort, but it's just sad. I'm really tired about the
[2580.18s -> 2594.14s]  pre-recorded streams lately. I mean, I appreciate the effort, but it's just sad. Planted message.
[2600.41s -> 2610.70s]  Time for a, where is it? Let's do this one. Literally no one said that. Yes, they did.
[2611.50s -> 2631.64s]  Look at the logs. Let me take a look at his list. Which one of these haven't I done?
[2632.65s -> 2643.74s]  Bronze on this one, but it's only 30k. So silver, silver, gold, nothing in the time limit. Okay.
[2644.14s -> 2653.48s]  90,000 kill 100 enemies mission. How long will this take though? I feel like it's going to take
[2653.48s -> 2668.65s]  too long. Going to bat. I'll do this one. 5,500 per kill. I'm here for the VOD chat.
[2669.37s -> 2690.84s]  Didn't they get rid of that? Doesn't exist anymore? Doesn't. The thing about VOD chat though,
[2694.81s -> 2700.60s]  why would they get rid of it? I mean, I get, was it, were they trying to like save
[2701.56s -> 2713.35s]  data or something? Why would you have it? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's one of those things where
[2713.35s -> 2719.46s]  it's, it's just, there's no reason to get rid of it and there's no reason to have it. Right?
[2720.84s -> 2730.84s]  It's weird. Core Monster just came in with another huge money drop. Core Monster,
[2730.84s -> 2743.69s]  I have to hunt 10,000 bits from Core Monster. Another 100 fucking dollars. In bits, 10,000 drop
[2744.81s -> 2751.02s]  on top of the other stuff. Thank you Core Monster for your insane contributions. It's true that this
[2751.02s -> 2757.75s]  is a pre-recorded stream because these are pre-recorded bits. Now that would be very
[2757.75s -> 2768.36s]  interesting. That would be very interesting. How did I miss that? Fuck, I don't want to mess this
[2768.36s -> 2777.16s]  up. I have to get away. One more, one more, one more, one more. Give me, give me, give me one more.
[2777.16s -> 2793.05s]  Oh, pre-recorded stream, pre-recorded bits. How would you pre-record bits? You would have to,
[2793.05s -> 2797.05s]  you would have to sit here. That'd be really hard to do because you would have to sit here
[2798.09s -> 2804.17s]  the whole time and then wait for this exact moment where I'm about to address your bits
[2806.65s -> 2809.45s]  and time it correctly so I don't do it too early or too late.
[2810.41s -> 2821.02s]  Hmm, would be interesting. What do I got for money? 330, I need, uh, we'll do, we'll do one more trash
[2821.02s -> 2832.95s]  pickup or I'll try to get one of the, uh, you are late in addressing bits half the time. Still have
[2832.95s -> 2862.39s]  to get it close. Look at that one. LOL, he killed that guy. Don't take a single hit. This one's hard
[2862.39s -> 2866.07s]  because you have this one area and there's a shitload of people. You just have to, you gotta get
[2866.15s -> 2869.83s]  kind of lucky actually. Let's try this. I'm gonna go for this.
[2874.52s -> 2892.04s]  Oh, I don't have any battery. How am I gonna do this? I don't have any battery.
[2908.76s -> 2920.17s]  The dash? Oh, it is a run. It's a sprint. Oh, it's a sprint. It's a sprint. It's a sprint.
[2920.17s -> 2929.22s]  It's a sprint. It's a sprint. I thought it was like a hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, like a dodge,
[2929.22s -> 2949.54s]  like better than a better dodge. It's a sprint. All right, gold, gold, gold. I got gold on
[2949.54s -> 2955.46s]  everything. What's, what is the most money? Ponpon. Probably garbage, right? And plus I can sprint.
[2956.34s -> 2957.46s]  Yeah, let me do garbage collector.
[2963.29s -> 2970.54s]  Super frog. How can you not like it? Don't forget the new sword too. Yeah, I know. And I have to
[2970.54s -> 2979.46s]  train. There's a lot to do. I don't even need the motorcycle anymore, do I? Is this faster? Is this
[2979.46s -> 3002.89s]  as fast as the motorcycle? It might be. Bike is faster? All right, yeah it is. When am I gonna
[3002.89s -> 3013.62s]  get Jerma's super frog? There already is Jerma's super frog. It's a BTTV emote.
[3027.90s -> 3028.86s]  I know that song by heart.
[3033.91s -> 3052.33s]  Why is the bike so big? It just is. This actually might go smoother.
[3053.13s -> 3061.50s]  Can I sprint with the thing on my back? Find out. Jerma uses BTTV emotes because he hates mobile
[3061.50s -> 3067.42s]  viewers. It's not true. Wow, this is gonna be great. I should be able to get like at least six to here.
[3091.18s -> 3115.62s]  Hates mobile viewers. Which way? Bad route. You're playing death stranding. Not quite.
[3128.82s -> 3132.49s]  You know, it would be kind of interesting. You know, you, you, everyone makes like the,
[3132.49s -> 3135.61s]  oh it's a strand type game. That's like the joke, right? It's the strand game.
[3136.25s -> 3141.53s]  But imagine if there was a game like GTA where if you ate anything, if you actually just made trash,
[3143.61s -> 3149.61s]  it would be way worse than this. The streets would be made out of trash.
[3153.66s -> 3157.50s]  If you like ate food in a like a game like GTA, let's say you need to eat to live
[3158.46s -> 3169.51s]  and every time you ate something it just got thrown on the ground. If that went into everybody
[3169.51s -> 3175.06s]  else's game, there would be people specifically eating just to make sure there was trash on the
[3175.06s -> 3192.82s]  ground. I wonder what an experiment would look like if you had like, if you actually had a game
[3192.82s -> 3197.78s]  whose sole purpose was built around people making trash and people cleaning up the trash
[3198.34s -> 3225.78s]  and you got to pick which one you wanted to do. That would be insane, right? I'd pick up the trash
[3227.42s -> 3232.30s]  and make picking up the trash way more difficult than just throwing it on the ground.
[3233.02s -> 3255.24s]  Get to 50 please. Even with the sprint, not even good. Yeah and when you pick up the trash, you get
[3256.44s -> 3260.33s]  you pick up a hundred pieces. If you get like a hundred cans you get a new skin
[3261.13s -> 3267.06s]  or if you deliver a hundred bags of trash you get, you unlock like skins and stuff.
[3282.39s -> 3295.53s]  All right I'm going for this one right here. The game could just be called Town Cleanup.
[3296.17s -> 3305.98s]  I wonder how many different discord groups would appear to try to systematically put
[3305.98s -> 3311.02s]  as much trash down as humanly possible and how many others would be trying to do against it.
[3322.06s -> 3331.66s]  Kill him. Viscera Cleanup Detail? Yeah like Viscera Cleanup Detail but it's not a lot.
[3344.38s -> 3350.86s]  What the fuck was that lock on? What was that lock on? I tried to change the lock on and it got
[3350.86s -> 3360.39s]  whacked. Yeah but imagine that would be, I actually, I'm a weirdo, okay? I would really
[3360.39s -> 3365.91s]  think that game was fun. I love House Flipper. I love Viscera Cleanup Detail. I think a lot of
[3365.91s -> 3374.49s]  people severely underestimate just how much people like to tidy shit up in games. Or even if there
[3374.49s -> 3385.14s]  was, it was only cleaning up and rebuilding. I'm a weirdo. I'm weird. See, see this hat? Oh it's weird.
[3385.70s -> 3405.80s]  What does that mean? What does it, see this hat? I have enough money, let's go. No, I need to go
[3405.80s -> 3420.50s]  to the uh, another big bit drop. It's a money stream. I'm gonna play No More Heroes every day.
[3421.06s -> 3430.52s]  Money streams. Violactory, who is one of our resident trillionaires, uh gave another 5,000
[3430.52s -> 3446.09s]  bits. Cranberry Chocolate Sundae, fuckhead. Is that like your favorite sundae? Cranberry
[3446.09s -> 3457.22s]  Chocolate Sundae, fuckhead. Oh is that like what he literally says? It's from this, oh yeah. Cranberry
[3457.22s -> 3469.00s]  Chocolate. Fuckhead. Listening to screaming sound effects and people diarrheaing sounds. Diarrheaing
[3469.00s -> 3484.07s]  is uh really normal. I didn't say that I was normal. I, you know what guys, I am pretty normal.
[3484.71s -> 3495.77s]  I'm pretty fucking normal. I, I chores, I do errands, I go to sleep, I wake up, I do my taxes,
[3496.33s -> 3502.33s]  I fill up my gas, I drive around, I take care of, I'm a pretty normal goddamn person.
[3503.45s -> 3517.74s]  I eat, I go, oh that was, that was good. This is a good steak and cheese sandwich.
[3518.90s -> 3542.90s]  I'm pretty normal. You suck at acting normal. What a boring life. No, you can have a normal
[3542.90s -> 3552.22s]  life and not have a boring life? What's, what? Oh that's right, I did say that I did call it a
[3552.22s -> 3572.41s]  changer beeper last night and people wanted to literally murder me. You're right, I did. I know
[3572.41s -> 3591.22s]  because I, I, I saw it a million times. Strength increase, good. Well let's do the stamina. Squats.
[3595.90s -> 3599.42s]  Look at this ring. What is it? What, what, what, what, what? It's just Colgate ring, right?
[3599.42s -> 3603.67s]  Everybody, red, white, and blue lines. Everything, it's Colgate, right?
[3616.44s -> 3619.00s]  When I say it, it's not funny, but when you say it, it's funny.
[3620.31s -> 3634.07s]  What's going on there? What's up with that? What's up with that? Explain this normalcy.
[3634.87s -> 3688.06s]  Hold on, wait, I can't, it's going too fast. You gotta have context with that image. You can't just
[3688.06s -> 3693.58s]  be like, look, hey, look, this, okay, that is a pretty normal occurrence. If, but if there's
[3693.58s -> 3702.52s]  context behind what that image is. Did a live stream based around being slimed Nickelodeon style
[3702.52s -> 3708.68s]  by your audience and one of the games was trying to get the audience to say things that they,
[3709.72s -> 3714.04s]  maybe they would say, oh, you guys say diaper all the time. So I put on a diaper
[3714.04s -> 3719.64s]  to try to force everybody to say diaper and it worked. Is that, is that so weird? Is that
[3719.64s -> 3749.19s]  so abnormal? It's very abnormal. Well, all right, I gotta, how much is the new, the new prototype?
[3752.71s -> 3757.11s]  I hate absolutely everything about this game. This challenges yesterday's stream for worst of
[3757.11s -> 3770.17s]  the decade. This game, this game is really fun. What are you on about? This, this game is, I,
[3770.17s -> 3791.06s]  this is a very, I like this game a lot. This is a very, very fun game and the second one's good too.
[3798.78s -> 3802.78s]  Let's be real here. All the most famous people in history are worth weird,
[3802.78s -> 3829.80s]  really fucking weird people. Shit, it's ready. I need $148,000. I need it. I need that. How much
[3829.80s -> 3837.11s]  is it? 140. What do I have? 25,000. All right. If I do a couple more kill missions and you do them
[3837.11s -> 3842.23s]  right and not lose, then I'll get it. I've done my strength training. I've done my,
[3843.03s -> 3856.18s]  uh, my new techniques. I gotta make money. I need to make 120, $130,000. Let's go. Do coconuts. I'm
[3856.18s -> 3867.27s]  not doing coconuts. Coconuts is pound for pound the worst. What should I do? Uh, let's go to the
[3867.27s -> 3871.91s]  assassin. Kill a hundred people. Yeah, I'll do that one. I'll see how quickly I can get through that
[3871.91s -> 3901.61s]  one. Ooh, this is a new one. Pizza, but the finale. Chain restaurant pizza, but planes to open up.
[3902.25s -> 3920.28s]  That's 75,000. I did another huge bit. Message just come in another huge one. Another 5,000 bit
[3920.28s -> 3935.00s]  drop right now from snoozing coffee. Holy shit, snoozing. 5,050, 50 bits. I'm sorry. I'm not
[3935.00s -> 3940.28s]  looking at the game right now. Uh, they say at, you know, you know, at first I was going to have
[3940.28s -> 3944.52s]  this message be dedicated to make you play God hand. And I was really angry in that message
[3944.52s -> 3949.32s]  because you like this game so much with it's similar being so similar to God hand. And we
[3949.32s -> 3953.48s]  all know you would like God hand if you would give it a real chance and learn the controls.
[3953.48s -> 3958.28s]  But then you said some nice things about us, the community. So I rewrote this message,
[3959.24s -> 3964.44s]  but for real play God hand. I'll explain why in the afterstream hangout, Hey chat, God hand rise up.
[3967.67s -> 3981.70s]  I played God hand for like 10 minutes. I still own it. Rise up is a sick of play it for real.
[3981.70s -> 3986.42s]  Like do it for real. Did I hate it? Did I just not get it? Did I like not give it the real chance
[3988.34s -> 3997.99s]  play it for 10 more, more than 10 minutes. So does anybody have a clip of me playing it?
[3998.79s -> 4008.94s]  I mean, I didn't remember he hated it. You said you played it for 10 minutes. Of course,
[4008.94s -> 4018.74s]  that's not a real chance. You didn't beat the tutorial because you couldn't get used to the
[4018.74s -> 4025.03s]  controls in five minutes. God hand is garbage to be honest. He didn't beat the tutorial.
[4034.49s -> 4040.78s]  When is, um, I gotta get this off. This, I just looked over my other monitor and full screen is
[4040.78s -> 4048.54s]  this image. Get that out of here. All right. Let's get pizza. But when does the cuphead
[4048.54s -> 4053.74s]  DLC come out? I feel like they announced that a year ago. When is it? When, when did we get to get
[4053.74s -> 4063.75s]  that? It's actually going to be pretty tough. They all have lightsabers. Holy shit.
[4063.75s -> 4074.98s]  What are you doing? Trying to run. I can't run. I can't run guys.
[4078.12s -> 4082.36s]  Just stop at me. I can't get up.
[4087.99s -> 4088.87s]  Oh my God.
[4088.87s -> 4122.97s]  Oh, well that's why it's the finale.
[4129.98s -> 4134.57s]  I saw the screamer last night of Chuck E. Cheese demanding bits from the kids when he won the games.
[4134.57s -> 4141.94s]  He had a rat like grin. Oh, okay. God hand. No, let me beat this first. I need money.
[4142.90s -> 4163.38s]  The sprint doesn't work. I can't go that way. The sprint doesn't work. I got baited by my own chat
[4163.38s -> 4174.86s]  telling me to be baited by me. You can't sprint. You can't sprint and fight. It's out of combat.
[4174.86s -> 4201.96s]  Sprint only. Give me this money. We told you that. Who told me that? Crazy Ann. All right. Time to
[4201.96s -> 4230.78s]  win. I can't even sprint here. It's truly absolute out of combat. Only out in the outside world.
[4234.70s -> 4252.20s]  Dude, you have no health. This is a bad thing to do when somebody's right behind you.
[4255.38s -> 4275.35s]  I thought he was taunting. I thought he was taunting. I thought he was fucking taunting.
[4275.35s -> 4280.47s]  He put his hand up like yeah. I'm boiling. I haven't been able to do one of these
[4281.03s -> 4289.11s]  in like three in-game hours. I mean what's with the yelling I just did? He said that I was taunting.
[4289.99s -> 4316.31s]  It's not to relax. If I had anything to say to you it would be this exact message.
[4317.11s -> 4323.10s]  You're the guy that gave me less chicken than one chicken wing last night at Arby's, right? You said
[4323.10s -> 4327.02s]  your name was Jeremy something. Never got to the last name. Let me just say on behalf of the chat
[4327.02s -> 4331.82s]  could you please make an Arby's chicken wing on stream and stop slacking off at work. Thanks.
[4331.82s -> 4354.34s]  Mr. Jeremy Arby's. I'm going to kill that CEO. I'm taunting. Real voice.
[4356.74s -> 4374.66s]  Why is everyone suddenly talking about that shitty god hand game? I would hold up. After you say that
[4374.66s -> 4379.70s]  please go into the giant safe. That's like a you have to close yourself in that safe because you're
[4379.70s -> 4383.78s]  about to get like rained on. People are going to rain like rocks and fucking objects at you and
[4383.78s -> 4397.96s]  stuff. I'm still like put your shield up. I'm serious. Spam B. I can't take it anymore.
[4407.75s -> 4412.47s]  I just did. That's cool. I played this game a lot of times. I didn't know that was possible.
[4413.27s -> 4435.94s]  You having fun? Yeah. Just sucks when somebody is taunting and you get hit and you lose the
[4435.94s -> 4454.60s]  one hit mission. All right. Let's go CEO. I got to make this count. Every single person you have to
[4454.60s -> 4459.13s]  jet. I have to get in there and kill somebody. I got to get in there and kill somebody. Somebody's
[4459.13s -> 4464.17s]  like right in the front row immediately. I'm going for the not greed. I'm just going to go in. Try
[4464.17s -> 4474.38s]  to go up. Let's go. I just have to get in there and get a swipe on someone like that.
[4475.18s -> 4475.58s]  Yeah.
[4477.10s -> 4477.58s]  There it is.
[4527.16s -> 4532.49s]  Get him. Kill him. He's on the ground. He's on the ground.
[4534.25s -> 4571.85s]  Get him. And I'm not doing the extra swing. All right. Slow down.
[4574.01s -> 4586.71s]  Taunting. I was going to fill up gas. That one's so easy. Baby Jerma going to quit that mission
[4586.71s -> 4598.01s]  like he quit Godhand. Spam B. I can't fucking take it anymore. Another day. Another crash joke. No,
[4598.01s -> 4602.01s]  I just figured crashing into the wall was easy to get off the bike instantly. I'm just walking
[4602.01s -> 4621.85s]  into the thing. This is a good stream. I'm happy. Well, I'm glad you're happy. Is it almost New
[4621.85s -> 4643.40s]  Year's? When is it New Year's? In like six hours? Tonga? What's the country that gets the New Year's
[4643.40s -> 4670.18s]  first? This is the second time I've done this and I'm just realizing that the nozzle's not
[4670.18s -> 4690.04s]  connected to anything. I'm holding just a big grill lighter. It's wireless. It's a Bluetooth device.
[4691.00s -> 4700.55s]  Tesla portable battery charging. You still have time to make the worst voice of the decade.
[4702.42s -> 4707.74s]  I'm not even sure I could do that if I tried. It would end up being just a weird
[4708.86s -> 4714.86s]  mix of me trying to sound horrible and terrible and loud and I think I've probably unintentionally
[4714.86s -> 4735.72s]  done worse ones without trying. Can't talk. What? No, I'm like I don't give opinions on what's um
[4738.68s -> 4743.16s]  until tomorrow afternoon you're not going to know my opinion on any of these categories.
[4744.12s -> 4757.35s]  You'll get my opinion on them absolutely but not until tomorrow night. By the way, the nominees
[4757.35s -> 4778.36s]  are there. I want to vote on the on that but I don't want to watch a bunch of clips.
[4778.36s -> 4809.16s]  Oops. Okay, I have to finish this. Am I subbed? Ah, it doesn't look like it. 20 is good. So you're
[4809.16s -> 4814.28s]  not supposed to use your cell phone at a gas pump, right? Is that like a weird myth or is that true?
[4815.16s -> 4828.84s]  Is it true? Is it false? I've heard conflicting data on if you should use your cell phone at the
[4829.72s -> 4844.01s]  it's an old myth. It could cause a spark. Did you get that from Facebook? No.
[4844.33s -> 4854.49s]  You've confused gas stations and airplanes. No, look it up. Type in cell phone at gas pump and
[4854.49s -> 4867.29s]  you're going to go what the really what time is the New Year's Eve stream? The New Year's Eve stream

[4878.18s -> 4895.62s]  around 9 p.m. Eastern tomorrow. Yeah, New Year's Eve. That's so late. We have to count the ball
[4896.50s -> 4902.06s]  down. That's the point of doing a New Year's Eve stream is so I can count down the ball.
[4915.66s -> 4919.02s]  It's going to be midnight Eastern is when we're going to drop the ball.
[4922.84s -> 4928.49s]  If you're going to stay up for New Year's Eve, what do you? Well, it looks like it's 1120.

[6767.62s -> 6778.23s]  the bat and it was the worst experience in your entire life all right that was the worst i hated
[6778.23s -> 6786.79s]  that more than anything i would rather get hit by a pitch like i would have rather the fastball hit
[6786.79s -> 6792.55s]  me right in the shoulder than to have it hit me right on the hands of the bat and vibrate electrocute
[6792.55s -> 6797.03s]  my whole body and hurt for like no i'd rather get hit with a pitch
[6801.19s -> 6810.20s]  yeah it rattles your actual hand bones and arm bones and it feels like somebody took out your

[9009.74s -> 9015.72s]  crossed that let's put it this way i'm not sure we've crossed like the szechuan sauce threshold
[9015.72s -> 9029.06s]  for like i hate this tv show now you know what i mean it hasn't been that that catalyst
[9029.62s -> 9057.61s]  oh we're almost there almost pick it up what the fuck front of the buzzer didn't get it sorry 50

[9528.52s -> 9556.70s]  well maybe not yet did i do uh these yet i don't think i did you guys i'll give you i'll give you
[9556.70s -> 9564.49s]  credit you guys have been on point with the photoshop links these last few days but here's
[9564.49s -> 9572.90s]  the thing is this don't read this this is real voodoo you are now cursed the only way to reverse
[9572.90s -> 9578.98s]  this christine entire domino's meat lovers pizza on camera uh there's like over 5 000 people here
[9579.78s -> 9587.10s]  i mean i think did i just curse everybody i just cursed everybody you have to eat a pizza on camera
[9591.10s -> 9591.58s]  sorry
[9599.34s -> 9608.18s]  you fool i'm sorry i had to show it so you guys can see what i was talking about
[9612.10s -> 9638.95s]  no you have to eat 5 000 pizzas extended combo let's do this is another bench press
[9639.91s -> 9654.98s]  let's do it domino's is gonna have a spike in sales today papa john's pizza is actually the worst
[9658.04s -> 9666.82s]  um yeah it's like it does it does like it does like suck doesn't it um who out of all the chains
[9666.82s -> 9675.32s]  who has the best people i know that's simple that would be pappagino's but that pappagino's i think
[9675.32s -> 9688.98s]  is a new england thing so that's not technically like a like a national chain right it's only a
[9688.98s -> 9707.16s]  northeast thing so i know that counts does it papa john's
[9716.20s -> 9722.81s]  chain pizza is strange because if you have a bad chain pizza at least in my case
[9723.77s -> 9731.75s]  there's never a single solitary fucking reason to ever eat it again i've eaten papa john's
[9731.75s -> 9737.59s]  probably twice and it was 15 years ago i was like oh this is this sucks i don't like this
[9737.59s -> 9742.07s]  oh this well let me look around in a circle there's like 700 pizza places around me
[9742.07s -> 9754.82s]  oh well why would i ever eat here ever again ever again for any reason but if you don't have pizza
[9754.82s -> 9760.10s]  places like sandwich shops pizza shops all over the place then i can understand why if papa john's
[9760.10s -> 9776.01s]  is all you got then that's kind of all you got all right with any team we have pizza place but
[9776.01s -> 9785.69s]  only the chain ones deliver that's another key part of this too is if a place doesn't deliver
[9785.69s -> 9791.80s]  you know something sometimes you just wanted to sit around and have somebody bring you something
[9797.24s -> 9807.74s]  live in sweden and their pizza sucks get some of those some of these places in in new york and
[9807.74s -> 9818.94s]  in boston new england northeast east coast pizza is it can nowhere in the entire world can compare

[10120.30s -> 10141.11s]  what i don't i don't agree with that boston best pizza in the country although uh regina pizzeria
[10141.51s -> 10147.75s]  yep top the list is the best pizza restaurant in the country boston has ranked seven
[10148.94s -> 10158.92s]  seventh on the list of top u.s cities for pizza seven it's top 10 in the country it's top seven
[10159.48s -> 10163.48s]  and regina pizzeria is number one in the whole country all right we don't have to have this

[10177.38s -> 10195.59s]  can't i can't say that can i all right play with cat he just cursed us
[10206.65s -> 10213.02s]  domino's i'm gonna be fair to domino's here do you remember when they had that whole campaign
[10213.98s -> 10218.54s]  on ads on tv where the ceo read all the comments about people talking about how bad the pizza is
[10220.95s -> 10228.71s]  hi i'm ceo uh kevin from domino's pizza we've seen your comments on how our sauce tastes like
[10228.71s -> 10241.48s]  ketchup and it's the grossest pizza on earth remember that go and give the performance of
[10241.48s -> 10259.91s]  your life you can do this and here's the thing after they did that whole campaign where they
[10260.71s -> 10264.63s]  and i'll give it to them i really have to hand it to domino's they did this is a brilliant strategy
[10265.51s -> 10270.87s]  they told everybody that that pizza was horrible they said our pizza sucks it's disgusting it's
[10270.87s -> 10280.47s]  dog shit but we changed the recipe give it a try everybody tried it like oh yeah like domino's
[10280.47s -> 10287.13s]  this sucks ass uh but they changed the recipe i'll order one just just from that campaign 10
[10287.13s -> 10290.57s]  years ago they made more money probably that they needed to in the next 10 years
[10291.37s -> 10309.14s]  what about you my stream sucks but we changed the camp it was brilliant it was an absolutely
[10309.14s -> 10328.97s]  brilliant campaign it was brilliant hi germa985 here we've seen the complaints about how my
[10328.97s -> 10335.45s]  stream is uh way too loud and way too quiet at the same time what we've decided to do
[10336.63s -> 10360.97s]  is try it is double down harvey moys which world is sarski you're way quieter than the ads i don't
[10360.97s -> 10381.88s]  want everyone to have a hurt ear get out of the kiosk oh my god you're annoying double down like
[10381.96s -> 10401.19s]  i make it louder and i talk quieter remember when i had subsounds that were 10 times louder than me
[10402.07s -> 10404.79s]  oh i remember i remember
[10416.95s -> 10427.94s]  i miss those subsounds sometimes i do too but as this channel has gotten
[10429.06s -> 10435.86s]  larger and the channel in the community has grown two or three times in the last three years
[10436.82s -> 10458.55s]  i it would be like having tts on screen i missed the salt and sanctuary days when
[10459.27s -> 10466.31s]  paul bearer would talk for like 25 straight i used to have a sub sound that was 25 straight seconds
[10467.27s -> 10481.61s]  i wonder what that would be like if i did that again just for like 20 minutes so you guys could
[10481.61s -> 10495.58s]  we could we could see but i feel like it would be an inaccurate sampling because i think people
[10495.58s -> 10508.62s]  would just sub to make sure that it played over and over again right am i seriously stuck
[10511.29s -> 10543.24s]  why is he not dead do it do it till the end of the decade we are not doing that oh that's

[11655.77s -> 11673.29s]  27 i thought he was older 29 in this game so does that mean in no more heroes 3 travis is
[11673.29s -> 11683.80s]  going to be 40 something he'll be like 38 or 38 he'll be like 40 that's pretty cool i like that

[11769.29s -> 11774.97s]  would keep the copy you wouldn't return the copy right you would copy the tape and then give the
[11774.97s -> 11788.68s]  original tape back to blockbuster did people do that yeah probably should that would that's
[11788.68s -> 11800.94s]  probably that was very horrible that's very rampant i'd say the game all right games already

[13607.61s -> 13619.78s]  against an athlete i would probably be okay in those i would perform pretty well although i can't
[13619.78s -> 13630.78s]  right now i would actually like to do that uh which one hasn't been done this one wrestling
[13630.78s -> 13650.55s]  moves only let's do it 2012 germa could have done it probably how many channel points for a 5g gum
[13650.55s -> 13678.86s]  joke i can not again that is really funny though that box box opens the street and said hey this
[13678.86s -> 13685.80s]  is we're gonna raid let's go and it's oh his cam just turned on i thought we were in the clear
[13685.80s -> 13713.64s]  oh well wrestling moves only you 70 000 away from a german wink save up is it only uh gun
[13713.64s -> 13724.74s]  people no that's actually sucks nice oh wait what i'm trying to
[13728.50s -> 13756.97s]  this is okay come on i wish i could sprint here this is gonna be hard to get this guy
[13757.61s -> 13790.76s]  the guy behind him get him give her this guy behind you get him this is 7 000 or 5 000 for kill
[13791.48s -> 13805.06s]  knock him out ddt that's the best move in all of wrestling it's seven night that's just that's
[13805.06s -> 13838.87s]  really good this would be all right wrong don't run don't run don't run don't run don't run don't
[13838.87s -> 13855.94s]  run don't run don't run don't uh and you've ran over here again again where's your wink
[13855.94s -> 13884.98s]  you need 75 000 channel points that's a lot oh well i think that's enough to level up
[13885.70s -> 13892.95s]  this game has worse graphics than gta 4 well this because it does it yeah this thing was on the wii
[13901.91s -> 13921.93s]  the wii was just a game cube that they injected with steroids it's not surprising let's go to the
[13921.93s -> 13933.05s]  gym i didn't mean the console was bad the wii was awesome i'm gonna make a statement here and it
[13933.05s -> 13942.42s]  might sound a little controversial to some of you guys i don't know we'll see i think the wii is the
[13942.42s -> 13951.66s]  best most appealing looking console it's like it i loved the shape and how much it weighed and how
[13951.66s -> 13958.62s]  small and compact it was i loved that just the the wii console i thought it was really really cool i
[13958.62s -> 13966.26s]  like the the top the pop the top off of the controllers i really really enjoyed the week
[13967.74s -> 13973.42s]  it was shiny sleek it was small enough it had a little tray putting discs and putting a game cube
[13973.42s -> 13987.18s]  disk in was so cool we're gonna do uh this one and that's it it was a very well designed machine
[13987.82s -> 14008.49s]  it had the virtual console it had super mario galaxy it had no more heroes it had carnival
[14008.49s -> 14019.80s]  games which i think sold better than no more heroes did in fact carnival games may have sold
[14019.80s -> 14043.14s]  better than mario galaxy it has manhunt isn't manhunt the games where you just walk up behind
[14043.14s -> 14056.49s]  people like strangling with plastic bags it is okay i'm making sure i'm thinking rock star made
[14056.49s -> 14069.21s]  it right i'm thinking the right game is this baseball arm what is this
[14080.65s -> 14102.44s]  manhunt is banned on twitch is that real i mean i i guess i can kind of understand
[14102.44s -> 14108.47s]  him i mean without that entire game is you just don't you just like hide like
[14108.47s -> 14113.67s]  sneak around and like i said flatten they just strangle people to death and that's it and like
[14113.67s -> 14119.67s]  put hooks in their heads and stuff is there is there a game to manhunt or are you actually
[14119.67s -> 14149.70s]  just sneaking around murdering people there is a flaw is there a point to this game would you
[14149.70s -> 14158.68s]  run yes i'm trying to be the number one assassin in the united states i'm not just creeping around
[14158.68s -> 14166.20s]  with a bunch of like grocery bags who's that guy over there yeah i'm gonna put a plow chugging
[14166.20s -> 14192.55s]  with a plastic bag it's not the same thing that was a lot of money let me go to the gym
[14193.59s -> 14201.34s]  and we'll do assassin number three get into the top three getting to the actual end of the game
[14201.34s -> 14231.05s]  here coming up soon the end game end of the game i know you want that right i had a dream where

[14992.49s -> 15017.83s]  madness okay is there a bathroom on the bus i don't think so bathroom out here
[15018.55s -> 15024.95s]  bathrooms on the bus are the worst i'm not sure i've ever been on a bus long enough where i've had
[15024.95s -> 15043.77s]  to use the bathroom bus reverse that you know what i mean found the cat i think the longest i've been
[15043.77s -> 15061.59s]  on a bus was maybe a few hours a couple hours maybe the longest i've been on the bus was 14 hours
[15063.40s -> 15072.66s]  holy shit where were you going from where to where yeah i've never had to be on a bus long
[15072.66s -> 15084.14s]  enough for the bus to need to get gas so and not probably less than something like that
[15084.94s -> 15092.92s]  because if you're on a bus for 14 hours doesn't that bus need to stop and get gas how do you get
[15092.92s -> 15096.28s]  did you just pull all right this is a real question i might sound like a fucking idiot
[15097.24s -> 15103.24s]  so if you're on a bus for like 15 hours you have to stop and give gas do you just pull over to a
[15103.24s -> 15107.16s]  gas station and just everybody just kind of hangs out while the bus driver gets out and fills the
[15107.16s -> 15120.46s]  gas tank is that like what happens pretty much yeah so just kind of like a highway rest stop
[15127.21s -> 15140.98s]  stay back this one's mine so there is a guy that's been training me what cat you frightened me for a
[15140.98s -> 15152.63s]  second kitty master oh i have been so i'm coming master

[17622.78s -> 17634.66s]  i would say that's probably peak fuckface i would say absolutely so i can slide from the left one
[17634.66s -> 17638.58s]  all the way to the right one in one go i can play fruit ninja across three screens
[17655.50s -> 17658.78s]  tape them together so they each other's back they're at each other's backs and
[17658.78s -> 17660.22s]  flip it around when you want to do something else
[17665.70s -> 17673.96s]  you know that's not i mean it's a that's not that's incredibly overdone but that's still
[17676.55s -> 17677.67s]  there's an application
[17677.91s -> 17692.94s]  all right
[17693.18s -> 17717.82s]  okay
[17736.76s -> 17746.86s]  minute 10 seconds left you save about a full minute or so and how much more do i get
[17748.86s -> 17767.13s]  yeah this one's worth doing time for the weapon well after when i get the new weapon i'll do the
[17767.13s -> 17774.33s]  gamble fight because then i probably kill way more people but i get 80 something last time
[17774.33s -> 17797.46s]  i probably go over 100 no more heroes part two string aka jeremy clicks every link in the chat
[17806.39s -> 17830.04s]  just hold on a second community content night yeah something like that okay here we go
[17830.52s -> 17838.86s]  subaki mk3 there goes all my money and there any parts for it there are not parts for it
[17839.98s -> 17865.74s]  it's just the best one somebody made this into a real pillow this image is freaking me out
[17866.30s -> 17875.42s]  this image is scaring the shit out of me where are you standing where are you this is a look
[17875.42s -> 17880.82s]  okay this look at this it's a table look at how high up you are from that cup of coffee
[17881.54s -> 17893.88s]  this is weird right it's it's like this that's that table look it's like almost like you're
[17894.92s -> 17912.74s]  why is that coffee so small this is not a table this is a floor that so this is just a gigantic
[17912.74s -> 17921.24s]  pillow then imagine forgetting that you put this on the pillow and waking up in the middle of the
[17921.24s -> 17927.10s]  night to go to the bathroom getting back situated comfortable and like turning your head in the dark
[17927.82s -> 17947.48s]  and seeing that that's pretty scary these dudes have never seen a rug before
[17951.00s -> 17957.21s]  i didn't expect the pillow to be that big i thought it was you look i'm working on it i'm
[17957.21s -> 17975.54s]  on the table i'm working on it i'm making this on the table jeremy's entire house is carpeted
[17976.34s -> 17986.18s]  yeah even the bathroom i want comfortable feet when i'm going to the bathroom all right where's
[17986.18s -> 17993.27s]  that one i got them i got the best weapon in the game it's this gamble fight yeah let's just go
[17993.27s -> 18008.78s]  carve up people for three minutes and see if i can make 200 000 i might be able to get more than
[18008.78s -> 18018.63s]  that how strong is this weapon strong is it equally as far distance between the third and
[18018.63s -> 18045.42s]  fourth blade it's not as strong but it's faster you'll find out oh that's cool this uh this is
[18045.42s -> 18067.98s]  awesome it's like it reminds me of a power ranger sword yes because he's walking away
[18074.04s -> 18085.58s]  holy shit okay that killed everybody rage is crazy
[18095.03s -> 18097.29s]  well this is worth it
[18100.20s -> 18103.26s]  you can't even spawn them faster if you kill them
[18112.94s -> 18115.18s]  it does take a little some of the windups take a little while here though
[18138.89s -> 18141.53s]  killing people dude yeah i know it's part of the game
[18147.72s -> 18155.45s]  ridiculous 39 what did i have 88 for
[18158.33s -> 18174.28s]  i love it i love that spin spin spin spin part of it it's great
[18178.76s -> 18183.32s]  what am i watching right now you're watching somebody farm money for the end game of no more
[18189.80s -> 18199.62s]  okay spawn me buddy let's go spawn spawn bring him over here all you
[18206.23s -> 18206.87s]  shit i didn't do it
[18211.50s -> 18212.38s]  why does it lie down
[18216.50s -> 18236.66s]  oh too many too many people one one guy
[18238.58s -> 18251.42s]  i'm killing people too fast
[18251.82s -> 18260.87s]  what a pain i killed less people than last time yeah i got only 80 i think they're dying so
[18260.87s -> 18267.53s]  quickly that it takes two or three seconds for them to respond it was less than the last time
[18267.53s -> 18282.74s]  it's actually too strong do the hot do this high charge attack oh you're right i didn't
[18282.74s -> 18285.62s]  i didn't even think to look for that let me try the heart let's try that
[18286.42s -> 18297.72s]  i say do the high charge attack in the gamble fight all right i'm gonna go for it but first
[18298.44s -> 18309.67s]  let's do this what that's an omega pog farming spot i know you already supposed to be dead
[18321.34s -> 18330.97s]  combo damn this is expensive all right combo it's probably the last upgrade maybe there's one more
[18330.97s -> 18345.58s]  after this
[18354.81s -> 18363.11s]  you're not hitting the right notes good strength and then health
[18370.14s -> 18374.92s]  so

[18488.98s -> 18501.38s]  with these upgrades you'll get a million dollars in no time let's try it
[18505.30s -> 18511.82s]  mr streamer there's a battery upgrade for the sword that gives infinite battery please get it
[18513.18s -> 18525.88s]  there was no it wasn't available i wasn't on the list when i went there
[18526.76s -> 18540.98s]  all right so he's saying high charge into the group of people
[18543.10s -> 18567.83s]  see if i can get this work low charge okay low charge to find a spot i can't see where i am
[18578.07s -> 18589.91s]  hello this camera sucks
[18590.71s -> 18594.17s]  oh it was high
[18604.62s -> 18606.54s]  all right well this technique ain't gonna work
[18609.13s -> 18613.05s]  take a long time to charge that up and look at this battery no this ain't gonna work
[18613.69s -> 18618.31s]  oh
[18635.78s -> 18665.54s]  someone getting one person wow this guy sucks i'm testing something this is not for real

[18695.27s -> 18699.43s]  oh he's gonna die in the gamble fight
[18724.44s -> 18727.24s]  you need to have infinite battery for it well that wasn't part of the deal
[18728.28s -> 18765.83s]  what the fuck is everybody still got 36 000 for that i think it was low actually i think
[18765.83s -> 18769.03s]  it was high actually i think it was low i think it was high you know it may have been low
[18769.75s -> 18781.51s]  oh fucking i'm just i'm just gonna do it my way i'm gonna do the scorpion mission right now and

[18817.91s -> 18827.37s]  risky i'll get a body pillow made of my face and it'll be in bed with me for at least three nights
[18840.70s -> 18854.22s]  kim is gonna think you're a psycho all right so that it's three thousand dollars per
[18855.10s -> 18863.78s]  scorpion which means to get a hundred thousand you need to do so let's say 30 would be 60,000
[18863.86s -> 18894.12s]  40 i need what 50 40 what how many 50 something 87 that's not correct let's go
[18910.94s -> 18972.90s]  come on i need like a big scorpion party ah come on by the way if i do that over a hundred

[19023.93s -> 19043.00s]  nobody here this one doesn't count i got scammed i actually got scammed i just ran around a circle
[19043.24s -> 19054.07s]  15 straight seconds there was no scorpions i guess i the spawn rate was dog shit no that doesn't
[19054.07s -> 19084.38s]  count i died i didn't fail it instead failed well i died so that's why i failed fine i'll get it i'll
[19084.38s -> 19103.53s]  get it fine i'm gonna shred it after three nights you come here wait a minute i don't know why i'm
[19103.53s -> 19109.99s]  not doing that i'm going to the killing one these ones just these are so bad for money if i mow alone

[19139.64s -> 19149.80s]  don't worry i'll i'll i'll find a spot that of my choosing not of your choosing i'm not no of my
[19149.80s -> 19171.10s]  choosing why does that exist wait what somebody's selling this for 57 dollars what in the name of
[19171.10s -> 19191.19s]  god 57 dollars read the reviews what i mean people have bought this people have not bought this
[19193.66s -> 19201.70s]  there's a four star review it's pretty big so only buy if you want to get something that fills a lot
[19201.70s -> 19207.94s]  of space but other than that it's very good the floor pillows look excellent the floor pillows
[19207.94s -> 19214.76s]  look excellent on my floor very good the print is clear and looks awesome very well made great
[19214.76s -> 19219.96s]  pillows which are a great pillows which are a wonderful decoration accessory for every room
[19219.96s -> 19239.43s]  quality is good colors are shining bright what is good what is going on we originally ordered this
[19239.43s -> 19244.55s]  product to use as cases for sleeping pillows since the fabric used is rather rough to the touch it
[19244.55s -> 19249.83s]  is not really so suitable for that purpose however as its original and stated intended use is to be
[19249.83s -> 19254.47s]  a floor pillow case i will not count our failed experiment against that product for its intended
[19254.47s -> 19259.51s]  purpose for the pillow case is really good robust fabric keeps its shape machine washable clear
[19259.51s -> 19264.87s]  vibrant colors that don't wash out very good quality and i can definitely recommend it if
[19264.87s -> 19270.63s]  you want a shiny pretty happy case for a couch or floor pillow to lounge on and then in brackets
[19270.63s -> 19275.27s]  consider getting a filler pillow along with the case if available we didn't and it's not trivial
[19275.27s -> 19280.39s]  to come by a 90 by 90 centimeter pillow where i live printing and shipping was fast without any
[19280.39s -> 19284.63s]  issues my only request for redbubble is to add actual sleeping pillow cases made out of the
[19284.63s -> 19299.32s]  same fabric as the bedding covers of the product line up shiny happy pillows similar designs
[19303.02s -> 19317.48s]  what's the fuck let's read these reviews this is on a different product completely separate it's
[19317.48s -> 19323.08s]  just it's my it's it's the germ of fear face on another pillow we originally ordered this product
[19323.08s -> 19327.08s]  to use as cases for sleeping pillows since the fabric uses rather rough to the touch it's not
[19327.08s -> 19331.32s]  really suitable for that purpose however as its original stated intended use it is to be a floor
[19331.32s -> 19334.68s]  pillow case i will not count our failed experiment against the product for its intended purpose the
[19334.68s -> 19338.04s]  pillow case is really good robust fabric it keeps its shape machine washable clear vibrant colors
[19338.04s -> 19340.76s]  that don't wash out very good quality that i can definitely recommend if you want a pretty
[19340.76s -> 19356.68s]  shiny happy pillow case it's the same fucking thing it's the same seven reviews he's just
[19356.68s -> 19368.98s]  discovering bots for the first time this one has 53 reviews guys why would you want
[19368.98s -> 19386.52s]  my face on a spiral notebook what are these 53 reviews great notepad well received i really like
[19386.52s -> 19391.88s]  it i was surprised at first because i didn't think it would be so wiggly but i soon started
[19391.88s -> 19399.53s]  to use it for a lot of notes the artwork on the spiral is great quality and the surface and pages
[19399.53s -> 19432.95s]  were immaculate amazing the notebooks were very sturdy is there a shower curtain wait this is
[19432.95s -> 19442.04s]  shower curtain there's not a german 985 this one's fucking this one sucks what happened to
[19442.04s -> 19451.88s]  this one did you not even bother to center the image you just didn't even bother to center it
[19461.77s -> 19474.89s]  rule of thirds hold on show show all right i'm gonna show i i can't like save these images
[19474.89s -> 19482.54s]  hold on let me put this on the screen this is freaking me out i could probably spend an hour
[19482.54s -> 19499.80s]  looking at this stuff just do it i'm not gonna buy these all right hold on can i what happens
[19499.80s -> 19522.57s]  if i do this no i want a different image i want different please and thank you does this work

[19554.89s -> 19563.99s]  for what you need to get the germa cover to match what what cover jesus christ all right
[19563.99s -> 19567.91s]  this is like a whole nother stream there's a whole no no this is an entire nother stream
[19569.67s -> 19580.84s]  i i wanted before the new year's party i want to do this this is ridiculous this is what we're
[19580.84s -> 19585.64s]  gonna do for an intro we're gonna look up all the bootleg germa 985 faces on shower curtains
[19586.28s -> 19613.46s]  that is ridiculous people saying hey just like dude you gotta like take those take those down
[19615.90s -> 19621.80s]  you can hear the phrase for every door that's closed three open that's programmer lingo
[19632.74s -> 19639.45s]  for every for every door that you close three more open fixing bugs and shit that's for every
[19639.45s -> 19645.35s]  one that you get rid of 10 more will take your place we don't say that yes you do i know
[19645.35s -> 19649.59s]  programmer i know programmer and that's where i got it from they told me that's what they say
[19650.23s -> 19682.28s]  he knows a program pog yeah i know he's a toilet don't all right stop looking that stuff up
[19683.16s -> 19686.68s]  because tomorrow uh that's gonna be a lot of there's a lot of content there
[19686.68s -> 19690.20s]  i just saw a toilet lid with your face on it no more don't look up anymore
[19693.00s -> 19710.09s]  fucked up there
[19716.89s -> 19725.32s]  let them get back up no
[19725.32s -> 19729.22s]  oh
[19744.02s -> 19776.12s]  come on lock on somebody
[19785.74s -> 19788.30s]  it's been like six hours and i still can't get that out of my head
[19788.30s -> 19812.22s]  good
[19814.62s -> 19826.46s]  be big one one that goes up doesn't kill
[19831.10s -> 19844.23s]  come here
[19846.98s -> 19849.54s]  yeah the horizontal movement is the best one but it doesn't happen every time
[19858.02s -> 19881.62s]  very good 66 not good
[19881.62s -> 19913.19s]  80 again stuck at 80 forever not even 79 this is a very good stream i like the stream because it
[19913.19s -> 19917.03s]  is the one i watch definitely five stars the only thing is the stream is quite long so i'm
[19917.03s -> 19931.75s]  only glad if you want something that fills a lot of space very good product 235 000 that's enough
[19931.75s -> 19940.20s]  to get the snake outfit i think at least a couple pieces of it what about the entry fee
[19952.02s -> 19970.22s]  the entry fee guys i need five hundred thousand dollars yeah fuck the snakes i ain't doing it
[19980.98s -> 19985.30s]  if there's still all right i have two more fights to do so if after this one
[19986.02s -> 19995.90s]  welcome i got the money for it i'll get it i just bought these i don't want to do this one again
[19995.90s -> 20006.09s]  what's the uh this one's seven thousand per kill seven thousand kill all targets it's a secret
[20007.32s -> 20013.43s]  seven thousand per kill kill as many as you can within the time limit missing when time runs out
[20014.15s -> 20020.07s]  how's this one gamble fights is going to be the most efficient yeah but it's boring
[20020.79s -> 20041.98s]  it's just grinding all right fine i just saw something really funny um i can't i i'm not
[20041.98s -> 20046.78s]  going to say it until tomorrow it's so dumb i just looked over here i mean i think we actually
[20046.78s -> 20051.34s]  already saw it on screen so let's just talk about it for one second there's a fifteen dollar and
[20051.34s -> 20060.44s]  seventy six cents mug on this website it says germa nine eight five tall mug it's just a white
[20060.44s -> 20076.14s]  mug there's no branding there's nothing on it it's just a white mug just plain white it's just the
[20076.14s -> 20093.61s]  title of the listing what are they trying to say i don't know nothing probably it's probably just
[20093.61s -> 20100.95s]  a robot
[20101.91s -> 20143.21s]  pretty good start actually this is a really good start you can't even hear the music yeah it gets
[20144.01s -> 20151.00s]  ridiculous it's called the grind man
[20169.98s -> 20197.24s]  get them all on the ground uh i got already 32 is that subs coming acdc freak five community subs

[24000.54s -> 24015.98s]  i know that's right on behalf of sylvia crystal i'm here to tell you that you are now officially
[24015.98s -> 24026.12s]  ranked second thanks that was a close one almost didn't make it it was a fine fight sir
[24027.16s -> 24031.00s]  shit that was close so what is it is the last fight between oenstein and smog here
[24045.99s -> 24072.71s]  marvelous upgrade the sword first let's see how much money it takes so all those minus twos and
[24072.71s -> 24080.94s]  plus two referring to frame data but what people trying to tell me to save a few extra frames or
[24080.94s -> 24090.33s]  add a few frames i saw a lot of add some frames i don't i didn't need to lose frames i don't know
[24090.33s -> 24095.40s]  why everyone's saying that i didn't need to do it early it's kind of stupid it's weird why is
[24095.40s -> 24102.57s]  people saying that hi we're sorry to inform you that your video membership will be revoked until
[24102.57s -> 24110.41s]  you return one of our videos it's titled french-made cafe filled coffee please return it soon
[24113.99s -> 24119.99s]  good morning mr touchdown i wish you a pleasant journey to number one
[24127.64s -> 24137.29s]  five hundred and fifty thousand dollars that's a lot of money is there any more jobs no there's
[24137.29s -> 24167.18s]  two more right there must be two more assassin jobs then to round out 20 sure my time is running out
[24167.18s -> 24183.35s]  it's almost 8 p.m in tonga we ain't gonna see that a new there's a new job what's the new part-time
[24183.35s -> 24216.06s]  job what else is something after scorpion what's the end of the year almost almost not quite though
[24216.94s -> 24231.54s]  2020 is right around the corner almost here you always the germapillow yeah but i can't all right
[24231.54s -> 24237.46s]  can that be like an early 2020 thing i have to actually have one made i have to i'm not buying
[24237.46s -> 24252.55s]  like a 500 dollar one on red bubble whatever this thing is called you come here all right what's the
[24252.55s -> 24272.81s]  job bike jump jump your bike off the point try to fly as far as possible is this game on steam this
[24272.81s -> 24286.31s]  is not on steam this is for we and playstation 3 xbox if you live in japan this is the original no
[24286.31s -> 24298.26s]  more heroes the ps3 version sucks is what i've been told a bunch of times i'm told it's not great
[24299.06s -> 24307.88s]  i also was told that the ps3 version of this game for some reason maybe they just didn't think they
[24307.88s -> 24314.12s]  were ever going to remake the second game but didn't they put like five or six of the bosses
[24314.12s -> 24321.27s]  from no more heroes 2 in the game as just random just bosses you can fight afterwards so kind of
[24321.83s -> 24333.38s]  i'd rather just play a second no culture here nothing but dropouts and even dropouts can create
[24333.38s -> 24339.54s]  their own culture ride those waves dropouts rise those bikes but the biggest dropouts of all they
[24339.54s -> 24344.26s]  jump good jump will jump start your future it's a world that only those who experience it can
[24344.26s -> 24348.34s]  understand a wide and wonderful world the god of jumping away so you jump long and jump hard
[24349.64s -> 24354.44s]  speed up and jump from the ramp on the point but from a well-timed wheelie jump to jump further
[24355.16s -> 24379.00s]  three time there is a time limit so just straight ahead where is it how far down the road is it
[24379.64s -> 24398.98s]  here we go that's pretty fucking far okay i just jumped out of the world i jumped out of the
[24398.98s -> 24423.19s]  invisible i went past a barrier 50 000 50k for like 10 seconds let's see what the last two assassin
[24423.19s -> 24430.49s]  missions are yeah that's insane money for no time at all i'll just do that like five times
[24435.43s -> 24455.50s]  what is the final mission kill without taking a single hit from the enemy 10 000 per kill
[24455.50s -> 24462.09s]  holy shit that's a lot kill all the enemies with the time limit you'll face cloned humans
[24465.06s -> 24476.12s]  oh that's some i shouldn't even attempt it why is this one good kill all the enemies
[24476.12s -> 24483.21s]  within the time limit i mean this is the final one might as well do it
[24483.93s -> 24495.10s]  may you find 10k per kill but you can't get hit and it's probably three minutes so if you figure
[24495.10s -> 24499.82s]  if you have to not get hit for three minutes sure you might make 500 000 but you have to you can't
[24499.82s -> 24532.76s]  get it for three minutes shit i haven't peed in seven hours i probably should do that yeah after
[24532.76s -> 24545.64s]  this after this i'm gonna go grab some water and yeah i'm just gonna hydrate take pee and we'll
[24545.64s -> 24560.39s]  come back and we'll finish up the game after this though mission start so this is baseball
[24561.19s -> 24578.02s]  is it baseball it's not baseball oh no it's just no
[24583.11s -> 24600.90s]  you hear that audio too much blood he's not gonna pee till next year in tonga
[24601.54s -> 24652.04s]  that would be something now wouldn't it that's pretty crunchy can i do it 30 kills
[24662.22s -> 24675.42s]  that's really good too it takes that's one minute for 90 000 that's probably
[24676.78s -> 24680.06s]  that's probably better than more reliable yeah that's more reliable than the bike
[24680.70s -> 24694.12s]  is it 550 okay i also need to let me check the shop just the sword shop i also have to upgrade
[24694.12s -> 24713.83s]  my body yeah talk to the ball guy yeah he's right next to the get it all done here first
[24713.83s -> 24726.81s]  let's go check out the sword stuff actually this is right here isn't it yeah get this done
[24741.70s -> 24762.26s]  that dumpster is unopened bench press one more time 64 000 oh this is kind of tough now
[24763.30s -> 24771.61s]  so here we are 750 people ever recording this video 750 people are now subscribed to the channel
[24772.25s -> 24799.50s]  found the same site thank you so much it got deleted it got deleted right let me say and
[24800.22s -> 24825.48s]  squats wait i do appreciate little mini games like this like sort of san andreas style of
[24825.48s -> 24832.14s]  have an open world in a gym but i really wish that each one of these you had to do them faster
[24832.14s -> 24841.58s]  or something it's the same minigame every time wait for you it's so hard and no more heroes too
[24841.58s -> 24857.70s]  yeah that's the balls too that is you're right it isn't an open dumpster good catch
[24869.32s -> 24872.47s]  giving up on the balls i don't know
[24874.41s -> 24894.87s]  keep practicing shit do i need one more the real question is how much is the upgrade for the
[24894.87s -> 24919.06s]  katana if it's more than three or four hundred thousand i'm not i don't think i'm gonna do it
[24928.98s -> 24933.94s]  no balls if i don't do it single finger on anything something to drink all right weapons
[24934.98s -> 24946.41s]  parts well that has to be a joke 999 a million beam katana energy saving part
[24947.37s -> 24959.11s]  for sabaki mk3 set this into the heart of the motherboard inside the beam it's just
[24959.11s -> 24966.81s]  infinite battery it will never have to be recharged okay all right this one's power
[24967.69s -> 24981.35s]  uh i just i'm gonna do this one yeah this is the best one it's expensive but i'm gonna make it
[24982.31s -> 24992.60s]  one of the germa stream awards are going to actually take place
[24994.81s -> 25003.66s]  so the probably at uh the stream is going to start around six pacific so around nine p.m
[25003.66s -> 25008.12s]  eastern is when it's going to turn on i would assume we'll hang out for like 20 30 minutes
[25009.00s -> 25018.49s]  relax maybe go over some uh red bubble uh scams and probably around 6 30 i'd say
[25019.45s -> 25025.46s]  6 30 6 30 ish we'll probably start doing them probably they won't take more than a couple
[25025.46s -> 25030.10s]  hours like just like last year but i wanted to line up right when we do the last one we can count
[25030.10s -> 25035.61s]  the ball down all right i'm gonna do that mission again that fighting one because it was really
[25035.61s -> 25055.94s]  really good for some reason i we were saying gta grand theft auto and i don't know why you can
[25055.94s -> 25060.90s]  run through every chain link fence in grand theft auto and this game became grand theft auto for five
[25060.90s -> 25102.33s]  seconds i don't know why yeah no way did i just go across the bridge for no reason i did didn't i
[25102.89s -> 25121.40s]  i want a giant goddamn circle wait are we back in single letter emote only mode
[25122.20s -> 25136.41s]  i didn't even say anything we're just doing it this is 90k yeah this is almost 100,000
[25137.21s -> 25143.69s]  then after this i'll do the bike jump like a few times and we should be there
[25154.36s -> 25172.49s]  really good money 250,000 i need 550 i do have increased power though maybe i should try the
[25172.49s -> 25191.62s]  gambling one again right that sounds like a good idea doesn't it done in 20 years i will return
[25206.52s -> 25211.24s]  i love you david i can't wait for that game to come out that games we're gonna
[25211.88s -> 25215.08s]  hey prediction that game is going to be one of the best games come out in 2020 prediction
[25215.96s -> 25238.44s]  um derma i'm on a joke withdrawal i need a joke to fuel my addiction well you don't don't just
[25238.44s -> 25246.52s]  don't be don't we did it to jokes there's this two sides to the mask it's comedy and tragedy
[25247.24s -> 25255.03s]  it's not it's not just it's not comedy and comedy by the way those people just disintegrated he can't
[25255.03s -> 25272.98s]  even spawn what you're asking for is the equivalent of picking out all the grain cereal in lucky
[25273.06s -> 25293.30s]  charms not just only marshmallows man you can't just you do that yeah that's a mistake
[25294.18s -> 25310.07s]  i want to take this fully powered up sword into the gamble one i could probably get 150,000 easy
[25311.67s -> 25336.95s]  what version is this this is the original version being emulated through dolphin on his fake we
[25338.38s -> 25347.86s]  no every time every time somebody asks it's been i own it it's behind me
[25360.38s -> 25389.42s]  emulators are illegal when the president does something it's not illegal let's do a jump
[25391.82s -> 25396.94s]  how do i have the control set up in dolphin i have it actually was a this that's a great question
[25396.94s -> 25401.26s]  because anybody that's you know has you know owns a we and owns a copy of the game and emulates
[25401.26s -> 25411.82s]  their own software um the we mode is that it's kind of finicky and what i mean by that is i have
[25411.82s -> 25417.83s]  this is a we motion plus controller but all bluetooth is not made the same apparently
[25418.55s -> 25422.31s]  and even if you think you have oh yeah i've got a bluetooth it connects to your computer with
[25422.31s -> 25430.98s]  bluetooth but even still some bluetooth dongles don't work with it and it can't sync them i had
[25430.98s -> 25436.18s]  an internal i think it's actually the one that i had it was it was it was a qualcomm was the
[25436.18s -> 25442.78s]  bluetooth that i had and it just wouldn't sync with it the dongle that i have that works with it
[25443.74s -> 25451.64s]  is a targus bluetooth dongle that's the one that i'm using it right now it's like a target
[25451.64s -> 25458.26s]  targus 4.0 bluetooth dongle and it will sync if you have the original we motion plus controller
[25458.26s -> 25473.86s]  there's this one i have here usb dongle he's making up words don't use that word that's what
[25473.86s -> 25487.46s]  it's called it's a dongle it's a usb dongle i mean i guess technically it's a usb bluetooth
[25487.46s -> 25497.18s]  adapter but it's a it's a dongle that's what it is and what you do is in the settings in dolphin
[25497.18s -> 25502.84s]  there are obviously ways to connect directly to a real we mode they have it built into the software
[25502.84s -> 25509.86s]  so it's pretty good and again for some of the new viewers that might be here uh just going oh hey
[25509.86s -> 25513.62s]  he's well why is he what's he doing why he's emulating this hold on let me just fucking
[25513.62s -> 25525.38s]  destroy this um this game notoriously runs terribly on the week and the ps3 version is
[25526.49s -> 25536.63s]  not the version that i wanted to play when you have more than a few people on the screen
[25537.51s -> 25542.79s]  especially when you do the blood splatter on three or four people at the same time it can drop down
[25542.79s -> 25549.43s]  to less than 10 frames a second also all the open world stuff on the original week is painful
[25551.27s -> 25560.23s]  riding the motorcycle around town is of rich chugs chug chug chug and it runs at like 480p
[25561.82s -> 25578.70s]  so that's why i've decided to do this how much money do i have 339 all right the gambling
[25578.70s -> 25589.51s]  mission will take care of this and then it's time for the end of the game save your excuses for the
[25589.51s -> 25628.31s]  judge 17 right uh 18 you can do the secret ending um maybe maybe how much longer i i don't think
[25628.31s -> 25639.32s]  i've ever seen the secret thing is it um is it much longer after the game or is it something i
[25639.32s -> 25652.86s]  have to grind out for a while for more than a couple hours go pee or i'm gonna do it oh right
[25652.86s -> 25663.53s]  okay i'll do it after this let's see if this if i if i don't get over 80 on this then i'm gonna
[25663.53s -> 25685.42s]  be very upset because i have the maximum power upgrade tried to do it i waved just didn't pick
[25685.42s -> 25759.18s]  it up so fuck dude go pee i'm gonna be i'm fine oh no no no no it's over battery that's good you're
[25759.18s -> 25766.82s]  all dead all right line it up that's so stupid
[25768.74s -> 25807.96s]  42 i can do better than that i'm tired of my arm you know before you said that i didn't notice this
[25809.00s -> 25814.52s]  but i'm no now i do notice that my arm hurts i've noticed that now my arm does hurt
[25815.72s -> 25819.61s]  i've been kind of doing these motions for the last two straight days
[25820.57s -> 25852.10s]  there's too much key building on imagine that were real line it up yes
[25853.94s -> 25876.09s]  i might get over 100 if i'm good it's too late for 100
[25882.66s -> 25911.40s]  not even 88 126 i'm almost there it's getting late too what is it 2 a.m eastern 524 all right one
[25912.36s -> 25933.53s]  more bike jump i'll pee don't worry i'm gonna pee before i get to the last area yeah it's two
[25935.75s -> 25942.36s]  we'll probably finish up we'll finish up within the hour i can't imagine how this full area
[25943.56s -> 25947.24s]  and another boss will take more than a full hour i don't think so
[25948.36s -> 25971.35s]  i don't i need to do the jump one more time that would be 50k thermos dongle doesn't work like it
[25971.35s -> 25999.50s]  used to nice nice good good one why would i read that because my brain is a scrambled egg
[26000.06s -> 26017.83s]  and just says things out loud i don't know why i don't think nothing to compare to the dream
[26017.83s -> 26028.28s]  sequence from seven hours ago will germa read anything that's highlighted pretty much
[26031.21s -> 26060.65s]  yeah yeah i tried to hit that person and it was bad for me
[26072.23s -> 26076.98s]  nancy drew games of shovelware knockoffs of professor leighton games
[26077.94s -> 26084.57s]  i have some really bad news for you nancy drew series redates professor leighton by about
[26085.53s -> 26103.75s]  probably 25 years nancy drew and the golden shoe came out in what like 1996
[26103.75s -> 26131.96s]  oh that was a bad one 1982 yeah at least the leighton games are actually fun
[26132.76s -> 26140.47s]  i played the leighton games at least one of them whatever one they ported to the ipad i've played
[26140.47s -> 26161.94s]  it that's not a real leighton game how is it not whatever the first one is professor leighton in
[26161.94s -> 26179.88s]  the golden shoe it's one of the first ones why didn't i call this number in the first place
[26180.04s -> 26193.16s]  yes hello ask who's calling this is the assassin's association right look i gotta talk to you about
[26194.68s -> 26202.12s]  she's done it again hasn't she hey are you listening excuse me for asking but are you by
[26202.12s -> 26210.60s]  chance an assassin whoa don't tell the whole world then you have been had sir you are not her first
[26210.60s -> 26213.40s]  it's a fake association
[26217.64s -> 26221.72s]  listen lady i don't know what the hell you're talking about who are you anyway
[26224.12s -> 26231.72s]  but here's the thing if it's a fake association and you've convinced a hundred people
[26231.72s -> 26237.24s]  that they're part of a assassin association and you have rankings and they actually are ranked
[26237.72s -> 26245.48s]  do you know how many isn't it real she is a professional you mean a fraud are you telling
[26245.48s -> 26254.09s]  me this was all just bullshit she set everything up would you mind telling real fake assassins
[26254.97s -> 26266.17s]  since you've come this far are you serious what's the point this is all some make-believe charade
[26266.17s -> 26273.05s]  but a good man finishes what he started fight to the end your most formidable opponent awaits
[26273.05s -> 26286.46s]  in the castle now off to the garden of madness is it oh yeah the entry fees she's collecting
[26286.46s -> 26296.30s]  entry fees from those 11 12 15 20 potential people we still have to kill each other
[26296.30s -> 26301.50s]  and we've agreed that that person is higher in rank than us so we have actually just made an
[26301.50s -> 26340.81s]  assassin's league let's just sure the entry fee makes no sense cut out the middleman all right
[26340.81s -> 26357.70s]  gene this is the last time i'm going to be able to play with you okay let's look at the cards for
[26357.70s -> 26389.96s]  the last time cool missed a couple oh i like this one and this one and that's it darth vader
[26393.42s -> 26418.49s]  good thing i've got the dash call the bike uh now my friends has had enough of my shit
[26429.18s -> 26437.32s]  this is dumb though what's the point of doing this there really is no point in this segment here
[26439.86s -> 26458.55s]  it's just this is kind of annoying that's all oh i got how far away is that how far away is this
[26458.55s -> 26466.44s]  is it worth doing it's right there all right it's right here and then i'm gonna pee i promise
[26467.08s -> 26500.22s]  which one should i get what do you want a ball let's teach techniques displays the position
[26501.34s -> 26509.66s]  of somebody said hold c to make it go faster it's not working uh despite the position enemies allow
[26509.66s -> 26521.38s]  you to jump and slash cool okay extends your dark side now increases the range of your grab
[26521.38s -> 26530.49s]  that's pretty good earned bonuses based on now too late in the game allows a jumping down attack
[26531.13s -> 26545.98s]  probably this one grab range is good jump slash might be good too jumping slash
[26546.14s -> 26562.17s]  dash yeah let's do it technique of love
[26567.02s -> 26787.37s]  i'll be right back and we will finish up the game i almost picked up the xbox controller

[26855.21s -> 26873.90s]  what it's like when my mic is muted i can see it it's right in front of me okay here we are

[27467.42s -> 27474.14s]  the path your path your path is that path that no one nothing can pass yet the path reach on
[27474.78s -> 27478.22s]  devotion is only given to those who perfect single thing reward them
[27479.42s -> 27485.10s]  no reward those who do not perfect does it reward or just evil lie down your path

[27764.14s -> 27772.22s]  the night when everything changed i fell to my feet right before my son's eyes do you not remember
[27772.22s -> 27783.62s]  this in my deepest memories i hear someone calling i remember it was a hot summer day

[27828.68s -> 27833.72s]  the pelvis because it was so unruly they couldn't get i told you the fucking weapon was bad at least
[27833.72s -> 27841.85s]  not anymore you killed him didn't you yes and that's why you became an assassin to kill me

[27888.07s -> 27894.55s]  jack up the age rating of this game even further so what who cares what if the game gets delayed
[27894.55s -> 27898.87s]  you don't want this to become no more heroes forever just being emulated right doesn't matter
[27898.87s -> 27905.43s]  fast forward this so you can tell me okay i'll make it short and quick this ain't other way any
[27933.78s -> 27936.90s]  no it's not an emulation it's not an emulation error

[29056.30s -> 29062.46s]  about it's my brother yeah of course it is what the hell the craziest shit i've ever heard why
[29062.46s -> 29067.42s]  would you bring up something like that at the very last minute of the game i would have thought you
[29068.06s -> 29070.62s]  would have at least expected a twist of fate of some kind
[29072.46s -> 29077.98s]  and hey where's silvia anyway she disappeared without a trace where the hell is she
[29080.14s -> 29088.54s]  you mean my wife what wife yes you know spouse soulmate they really they really threw it all
[29088.54s -> 29095.18s]  away in the last 40 minutes here addressing the audience ten years ago fast boarding because we
[29095.18s -> 29102.76s]  were both in college at the time shit all news to me i'm gonna need shock treatment to get over
[29102.76s -> 29111.37s]  this one i'm sorry for all the trouble my wife has caused you forgive her she caused me some
[29111.37s -> 29117.45s]  trouble all right but it helped me clear up a lot of things you know how women are especially my
[29117.45s -> 29123.77s]  wife a really big spender yeah she knew my income wasn't enough so every now and then she just
[29123.77s -> 29132.71s]  disappear she's a bad wife but a good woman are you telling me that you and her oh come on
[29136.90s -> 29139.22s]  we're similar in many ways
[29143.38s -> 29147.46s]  you're right face too suddenly you being my brother doesn't sound so awkward
[29150.10s -> 29153.54s]  let me ask you how do you plan to put an end to all of this
[29154.34s -> 29160.34s]  wait a sec you want me to tie up all these loose ends i don't think so you're the protagonist i'm
[29160.34s -> 29167.14s]  just a cool handsome foil who happens to be your twin brother hate to say it but it's your job
[29167.86s -> 29171.86s]  i want to bail but where the hell's the exit there's no way out is there
[29171.94s -> 29176.66s]  no getting out right bro this is like a shitty metal gear solid cut scene
[29177.22s -> 29179.54s]  then let's find that exit they call paradise
[29183.58s -> 29192.97s]  let's go and that imagine looking out your window and seeing that yeah you look out your
[29192.97s -> 29203.37s]  window you see two guys just running by with lightsabers did they both die at the same time
[29204.17s -> 29207.45s]  well there's no more heroes too so i'm gonna have to say i'm sorry the answer is no
[29212.62s -> 29240.12s]  don't skip i'm not gonna skip the credits two is not canon i mean it is yes it is three is not
[29240.12s -> 29253.48s]  canon three is canon they're all canon even the top down one is canon doesn't the travis strikes
[29253.48s -> 29264.52s]  again set up the third game in a way i'm fairly certain there's introductions to people in them
[29264.52s -> 29274.47s]  well we're gonna have to play it gonna have to do it eventually before the new one comes out
[29286.58s -> 29290.26s]  why would they preemptively make a numbered sequel non-canon yeah that doesn't mean
[29291.70s -> 29310.09s]  travis strikes again is a half of visual novel is it i thought it was like a top down
[29311.86s -> 29321.50s]  bullet hell type game we still have a sword but isn't it really twitchy and it is top down
[29322.14s -> 29335.06s]  play killer seven as well now here you go here are the voice actors dd bradley baker told you
[29335.06s -> 29357.27s]  it was the fish killer seven killer seven's on the game cube right it's on steam when did they
[29357.27s -> 29374.55s]  put it on steam oh shit okay is it a good port or is it crappy it's good it's all right it's
[29374.55s -> 29393.62s]  good good good for it's pretty good all right i'll play it it's also on the switch it's not on the
[29393.62s -> 29410.10s]  switch as far wait iirc the port is literally just dolphin running the emulator is it really
[29411.06s -> 29429.16s]  that's pretty funny if it's that's true it's not it's not that was the trailer the footage
[29429.16s -> 29437.70s]  they used for the trailer was dolphin footage but the actual port isn't huh that's crazy
[29438.34s -> 29456.95s]  google is a powerful tool yeah it is all right everyone here we go post credit
[29465.11s -> 29489.96s]  don't you let's go gene why everybody named gene i know too bad there won't be a sequel
[29489.96s -> 29505.26s]  yes there will actually uh it never was supposed to be a series according to suda right so didn't
[29505.26s -> 29508.62s]  sort of say that this was supposed to be a one-off thing and he was never supposed to make any other
[29508.62s -> 29528.97s]  games that's actually real that's actually to be continued shit my wiimote got disconnected
[29528.97s -> 29547.78s]  oh i gotta sync this back up play the uh the other ending can i see the other ending anywhere
[29547.78s -> 29581.22s]  that's not on youtube all right also i think i've unlocked the hard difficulty right sweet mild
[29581.22s -> 29595.21s]  bitter extremely difficult many strong men await you perfect for beginners bitter does anything
[29595.21s -> 29611.64s]  change in new game plus it's just harder everything has more health and does more damage
[29614.15s -> 29627.72s]  you keep your money in your katana so what do you spend your money on on snake skin oh clothes i
[29627.72s -> 29635.03s]  guess sure i'm just curious to how hard the default enemies are on the hardest difficulty
[29635.83s -> 29654.54s]  well not bad considering i have the best weapon available but if i don't do new game plus i
[29654.54s -> 29667.91s]  actually can just start on bitter right yes you can okay cool all right well that's uh that's
[29667.91s -> 29673.53s]  going to be it kind of a long one tonight make sure you get your votes in for new year's eve

[29985.62s -> 29992.95s]  go over a quick we can talk i'm gonna talk about this tomorrow too but there were a lot of big
[29995.24s -> 30004.60s]  streams in 2019 that were that required to hire people and resources and that shit is only possible
[30006.55s -> 30016.07s]  because of the support that this channel gets that's that that doesn't happen without
[30016.95s -> 30021.51s]  this ridiculous amount of money that some people give the continued subscriptions that people have
[30021.51s -> 30037.80s]  on this channel i'm not i can't do those things without it so seriously 2019 was crazy we'll talk
[30037.80s -> 30046.63s]  about it more tomorrow but thank you again superintendent charmers thanks for the 250
[30047.37s -> 30052.41s]  uh germa erectus apparently is an emote that says there's an error we've visited it wasn't found
[30053.90s -> 30058.94s]  i'm sorry i don't i can't see your emote i don't see is it was it did i get baited
[30059.50s -> 30073.50s]  i might have gotten baited snooze and copter thanks to the 250 on top of your 5000 bit drop
[30073.50s -> 30078.14s]  here earlier they say oh yeah i also want to tell you about i want oh here's is this we're going
[30078.14s -> 30084.89s]  to get the god hand uh this is god hand uh god hand has a weird over-the-top humor similar to
[30084.89s -> 30090.33s]  this there are more than a hundred unique moves to unlock with which you can customize your move
[30090.33s -> 30095.61s]  set you can assign a move to each button basically if you want to drop kick on triangle you can put
[30095.61s -> 30101.93s]  it there or maybe on x and put an uppercut on triangle etc there's a casino that actually
[30101.93s -> 30108.47s]  functions and the composer is the same one as the one from this game the reason you didn't like god
[30108.47s -> 30114.55s]  hand is because you were exhausted and frustrated by a bunch of throwaway ps2 games that you were
[30114.55s -> 30119.83s]  rushing through that night god hand needs a single full-length stream dedicated to it back me up here
[30119.83s -> 30125.27s]  chat besides it is old resident evil controls you know the tank controls you need to get used to
[30125.27s -> 30128.95s]  it i know it's probably the only bad thing about the game please give it another chance it better
[30128.95s -> 30145.70s]  be the first stream of 2020 okay it's not going to be the first stream of 2020 that stream i believe
[30145.70s -> 30149.54s]  is going to be joel and i playing keep talking nobody explores maybe it'll uh maybe it'll be the
[30149.54s -> 30153.62s]  second stream of 2020 third stream of 2020 it'll be early 2020 i'll do it again
[30161.40s -> 30166.20s]  you really you really you jumped into god hand after trying to make the shitty tony hawk ride
[30166.20s -> 30174.90s]  skateboard work for 10 minutes it deserves a second chance that's fair oh didn't i try to break that
[30174.90s -> 30179.14s]  over my i remember trying to smash that over my knee and i couldn't break it that's the only
[30179.14s -> 30197.35s]  memory i have of that whole stream well yeah i will give it another try i promise i only want

[30748.36s -> 30767.16s]  cancer center in boston from what i've been told so far that's the plan sponsoring running a marathon
[30768.12s -> 30776.01s]  is yeah i think the way that the boston marathon works is you uh i don't i don't want to speak
[30776.01s -> 30784.52s]  completely out of place here but i'm fairly certain it's uh you raise money for a charity
[30786.76s -> 30794.04s]  and then you run in the marathon for that charity i guess something like that i'm not sure if every
[30794.04s -> 30806.63s]  single person that runs the marathon has to do that but i know that's what people do my god's in
[30806.63s -> 30817.48s]  the chat holy shit that's that's horrible i look like i made it a raw chicken meat this is disgusting

[30850.01s -> 30854.73s]  bits appreciate thank you bloody punker for the 500 bits hey germ i've been dealing with a lot
[30854.73s -> 30859.77s]  of insecurity and paranoia around dumb stuff like my voice as you have a background in voice acting
[30859.77s -> 30862.49s]  and bring life to countless funny characters with you i was thinking you'd be a good guy to
[30862.49s -> 30873.72s]  ask about experiences the vocal insecurity tips about overcoming it thanks pretty much that when
[30873.72s -> 30878.76s]  you first start talking to people and you hear you i'm not sure if you're talking about
[30878.76s -> 30885.75s]  referencing hearing your voice back but when anytime anybody listens to themselves back
[30885.75s -> 30892.17s]  they all you always sound a little weird you sound that's me i don't like that everybody has this
[30892.17s -> 30899.05s]  weird um sort of it not that i doubt that they hate your voice or anything but everybody seems
[30899.05s -> 30906.30s]  to have that sort of you squint your eyes when you hear yourself talking but it just takes time it
[30906.30s -> 30916.63s]  just takes a while i mean at this point you just kind of know the way you talk and after a while
[30916.63s -> 30920.71s]  if you hear yourself back enough times and you just accept the fact that that's just the way you
[30920.71s -> 30933.90s]  sound you become okay with hearing it back if you go back and watch my first maybe 10 to 20
[30933.90s -> 30945.83s]  youtube videos i was trying to sound better i was trying to sound smarter and more intelligent and
[30945.83s -> 30953.34s]  better and and and more articulated and after about 10 videos or 20 videos or so it's just like i
[30953.34s -> 30956.30s]  kind of just know the way i just talk like this this is the way that i talk and that's it this
[30956.30s -> 30965.22s]  this is just what you get this is how i speak but for dealing with the actual insecurity on
[30965.22s -> 30979.59s]  your voice i wouldn't read too much into it to be honest we communicate this way i can't think of
[30979.59s -> 30985.51s]  the last time that i heard somebody talk to me or somebody was giving a presentation or doing
[30985.51s -> 30991.03s]  vocal work and i thought even for a second about hey that that doesn't sound right no that's just
[30991.03s -> 30996.92s]  you that's who that's your voice that's you and that's good that's fine everyone has a different
[30996.92s -> 31023.24s]  voice the guy from the servers okay server germa but yeah it's that that's who you are that's how
[31023.24s -> 31030.92s]  you talk that's the person that you are you got to own it own it whatever it is you got to own
[31030.92s -> 31044.76s]  the fuck out of it you have to own it i know him from the servers don't you but i wish you luck
