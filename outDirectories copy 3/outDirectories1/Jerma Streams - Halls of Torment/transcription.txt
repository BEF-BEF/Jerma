[27.00s -> 39.29s]  What's up? How's it going? What's happening? I'm at the beach right now. Oh, that sounds actually kind of fun.
[41.03s -> 62.65s]  At the beach? I'm at the North Pole. What? Where are you guys? No, good to see you. Today we're going to play
[62.65s -> 70.42s]  Halls of Torment. It's a vampire survivor's lake. I've had my eye on it for a little while and
[70.42s -> 76.90s]  unfortunately I'm playing this game one day too early because I believe the beta launches
[77.70s -> 83.70s]  in like a day or two. So that's my fault. I'm playing it literally like 24 hours too early,
[83.70s -> 97.69s]  but that's too bad because I want to play it bad. So even if it beta comes out the next day or two,
[97.69s -> 109.83s]  whatever, it looks really fun. I'm a huge vampire survivors fan. I'm going to play it. I'm ready.
[110.55s -> 118.12s]  I'm here for five minutes to laugh at how lame this is. All right, we'll see you later.
[118.68s -> 134.31s]  Thanks for stopping by. Bye. Okay. Anyways, let's go. I'm fresh save file. Hey, can you wait?
[134.31s -> 143.13s]  My boyfriend's in the bathroom. Yeah. What do you think? Like another 100 or two? Two minutes?
[150.02s -> 157.62s]  It's, yeah, it's a fresh save file. I love these games with a fresh save file because I'm going to
[157.62s -> 164.58s]  be terrible. I'm going to have no items. I'm going to be dog shit at the game. I love it. I can't wait.
[166.22s -> 180.14s]  What about Hilux too? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Your dog shit at all games.
[183.64s -> 188.20s]  Clearly think you forgot about the, the one to two headshots in a row. I got with the Huntsman last
[188.20s -> 198.95s]  week. I mean, I, I, I don't know if you knew that. I'm not sure you saw that footage. Yeah,
[198.95s -> 206.23s]  it was gonna chill out, chill stream. And I mean it this time. I just want to play this game and
[206.23s -> 215.99s]  hang out and I'll go on one or two rants. We'll find for all time's sake. Why not? Oh shit. It's
[215.99s -> 222.63s]  a chill stream today. You know what I should start doing? Anytime. I just want to sit,
[222.63s -> 226.07s]  just kind of relax and play and hang out. I'm just going to tell you, it's going to be the most
[226.07s -> 230.17s]  fucked up stream ever. I'm going to tell you, man, it's going to be so exciting. There's going to be
[230.17s -> 236.87s]  all kinds of crazy shit's going to happen today. So then when it's the complete opposite, then we're
[236.95s -> 249.34s]  good. It's, it's, that's how it's going to be, right? False advertising. That's all right.
[249.34s -> 257.29s]  You're still a streamer? I mean, yeah, I guess. Kind of. Yeah. What, what am I doing right now?
[260.25s -> 266.73s]  Dude, you're still, I streamed like four or five days ago. I haven't been gone for like six months.
[267.53s -> 280.01s]  But all right, you guys ready? Take a look at this. All right. So like I said, this is like
[280.01s -> 283.93s]  vampire survivors. I know nothing about the game. I've been told this is unbelievably fun.
[283.93s -> 293.46s]  I am so ready to play it. All I know is that there's this quest thing and this is chapter one.
[294.02s -> 300.79s]  I cannot wait to play this. I've been sitting on this for a long time. There are 200 quests.
[300.79s -> 307.62s]  And the game's not even out yet. There's 201 quests. The game's not even out yet.
[307.62s -> 315.56s]  All right. So what do I want to do? Survive until there are only 26 minutes left. So that's easy.
[315.56s -> 329.05s]  Well, no, I mean, it's just an easy mission. Defeat the imp chieftain. Okay. I imagine it's
[329.05s -> 336.87s]  just the gigantic. Okay. It's the gigantic door. All right. Move, aim, attack, toggle,
[336.87s -> 353.08s]  auto attack and toggle auto aim. Ooh. Okay. Should I hold the button down? All right. Level up.
[353.08s -> 359.02s]  All right. So I think you can get items in the game too. The gameplay is it has control support.
[359.02s -> 366.58s]  I'll do just keyboard and mouse for now. I'm into it though. It's he's going to be playing on food
[366.58s -> 374.55s]  mode. Did you know what actually is food mode? Diablo 2 summoning classes. It's that's like the
[374.55s -> 380.97s]  best food mode. I thought about this a lot. Summoning necromancer and summoning druid is
[381.69s -> 389.77s]  the ultimate food mode. You can play with one hand. All right. Hold on. Plus 8% area cone size.
[389.77s -> 397.94s]  That's pretty cool. Diablo is in one. Health regen crit damage and movement speed. Hey chat,
[397.94s -> 403.99s]  which one? Hey chat, which one should I do? Chat's complaining about the graphics. They don't know
[403.99s -> 408.87s]  what the absolute. I almost just said fuck, right? They don't know what the heck they're talking
[408.87s -> 426.78s]  about. I'm going to say moving speed. All right. There's something down here. Monster crits. I love
[426.78s -> 440.95s]  graphics. Gameplay. I have to pick up the things, but wait, I actually am moving kind of slow,
[440.95s -> 450.94s]  aren't I? You need to get the little guys. I think I'm doing okay. All right. Defense, range,
[450.94s -> 461.98s]  attack speed. I'm going to go with cone size. Is that stupid? We'll find out. Yeah. I love these
[461.98s -> 472.25s]  games. Vampire survivors was my game of the year last year. These are like, I love these. I'm so
[472.25s -> 483.62s]  glad this is getting the treatment where a ton of people just make these. I will say though,
[483.62s -> 490.10s]  a lot of them, I haven't really thought were that great. I thought they were okay, but I mean,
[490.10s -> 499.05s]  when you're talking about the vampire survivors is the king, but I've heard this one is quite good.
[499.05s -> 508.17s]  Oh, probably this one crit damage. I can't wait just to start absolutely mowing down monsters.
[508.17s -> 529.05s]  Really going to get that feeling of just absolutely mowing down monsters. What's the plot? I don't know.
[529.29s -> 537.78s]  I just like to click on the skeletons. That's all I care about. I should probably go pick up the
[537.78s -> 549.38s]  items though, make up some lore right now. Okay. You guys ever think that skeleton is like a really
[549.38s -> 554.84s]  strange thing that we just like, Oh look, Oh yeah, it was skeleton. This is because this is somebody's
[554.84s -> 560.54s]  bones. Isn't like the concept of a skeleton kind of like weird in a way that's like somebody's
[560.54s -> 571.69s]  bones. That's your entire skeleton. Like that is weird. We all just look like that. Pickup range.
[571.69s -> 583.53s]  No, probably this one 10% range, 10% cone. I'm way too high for that. Uh, it's all right. Don't
[583.53s -> 592.49s]  worry. We're not going to, we're not going to stay on it for that long. I don't think about that
[592.49s -> 600.63s]  shit, dude. I think about taxes, man. You know, what I was really thinking about the other day,
[601.19s -> 606.74s]  man, man, like we all have a skeleton in the inside of us. Like, yeah, dude, you know,
[606.74s -> 610.26s]  there's way more pressing shit to worry about than like the fact that we all have skeletons
[610.26s -> 615.26s]  in our bodies. Yeah, man. Really think about it, man. There's like, you got, you got like bones in
[615.26s -> 626.04s]  you. New enemy type. That's a huge great, by the way, it was like two or three times.
[626.68s -> 644.38s]  Jeremy, did you see the aliens are real? Yeah. Take me with you. Take me with you. Okay. Uh,
[644.38s -> 648.30s]  I'm just taking this straight away. Damage or attack speed. Can I get some math? Andy's in here
[648.30s -> 659.35s]  to help is 10% more damage better than more DPS. I'm curious. Attack speed means you will always
[659.35s -> 664.71s]  be doing more damage because you were swinging more often. I'm not so sure.
[665.43s -> 673.53s]  Now tax fees, but I would go for tax fees for sure. Damage, damage, damage. I think I'll go speed.
[673.53s -> 684.25s]  Speed sounds good. How have you guys been? How's it going? What's new? I'm gonna die. Oh, I got,
[684.25s -> 703.78s]  I just realized I have 500 health. I think it is healed. You should talk about aliens. Yeah,
[703.78s -> 711.10s]  I don't know. Guys, if the, if aliens are real, like nothing we say is really like, they might
[711.10s -> 715.42s]  be pissed off that we like eat each other. You know what I mean? Well, not each other, but like
[716.14s -> 719.10s]  think about like, what if, what if an alien species was like, wait a minute, you guys like,
[719.74s -> 727.61s]  you guys like kill and eat stuff. What do you mean? You, you eat, you eat things. You don't just take
[727.61s -> 735.86s]  in like energy from the air. I don't know. They might be like annoyed that we like eat stuff.
[735.86s -> 746.87s]  Who knows what the fuck is going to happen. I want the range actually deranged. I'm just,
[746.87s -> 750.39s]  we don't even know what, what it even could be. We don't even know if it's like a carbon based
[750.39s -> 761.26s]  life form. Nobody knows what anything, anything was going on. What is it? What would the alien
[761.26s -> 770.86s]  national anthem be? Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed on earth and we are going to play you
[770.86s -> 777.90s]  our national anthem first of all, to make sure you understand what we are all about. And it's just
[782.22s -> 789.75s]  just a midi version of our national anthem. And then we play them the orchestral version
[789.75s -> 806.82s]  and they give us all their technology area. Ooh, I did it. This is exactly what you did last time.
[807.46s -> 812.28s]  Yeah. Well, if you go to like a comedy show, they're going to tell like the same jokes all
[812.28s -> 818.22s]  year. You understand? Like if you go to like a standup show, they have like a bunch of material
[818.22s -> 823.34s]  that they wrote for like a year or two. And then they come up with more material, like two years
[823.34s -> 840.49s]  later, you need to be better than that. I'm just hanging out mowing down monsters, man. This is
[840.49s -> 853.77s]  really your material. No, not really. Not really. All right. It's starting to get a little harder.
[855.29s -> 875.48s]  Uh, I think this can't go wrong with crit chance. Oh, how much is in the non beta?
[875.48s -> 883.64s]  I look like there was a pretty good amount of content in this game. Are they unique?
[884.36s -> 890.23s]  That's the only thing I care about in every video game. It's like 20 hours worth of content. Oh my
[890.23s -> 903.75s]  God. OK, this boss is almost dead. Oh, a squill. All of your jokes are bad. Um, I don't think all
[903.75s -> 911.99s]  of them are. I think like maybe if I were to actually tell you what I really think, I think
[911.99s -> 921.35s]  that probably, probably like 20% of the jokes that I tell are bad. Maybe like 30, maybe,
[921.35s -> 932.17s]  maybe a little more. No, no, no, no. Wait, what is this? 30%? Hey, that means I'm batting 700.
[932.17s -> 938.55s]  Even if I'm, OK, even if it's 50%, that means I'm batting 500. Do you know that you can hit,
[938.55s -> 945.91s]  you can strike out seven out of 10 times and be one of the best baseball players ever. You
[945.91s -> 949.67s]  could literally go up there and swing and miss seven times in a row and then hit three home runs
[949.67s -> 959.64s]  and you're one of the best players ever. So let's translate that completely to, to, to my life.
[959.64s -> 963.72s]  And, uh, a complete false equivalence that it means absolutely nothing next to each other.
[963.72s -> 969.98s]  But I'm going to use these two points to tell you why I think that I'm doing just fine.
[969.98s -> 976.15s]  All right, what do I want? Astronomers Orb? Metal orbs that circle around the player and
[976.15s -> 981.05s]  damage enemies. Orbs are indestructible and permanent. All right, so this is build movement
[981.05s -> 985.74s]  speed. Short range projectiles in a vertical spread pattern. Projectiles remain for a short
[985.74s -> 996.49s]  while. That's OK. Lighting's my favorite type of damage. This one seems to be interesting.
[996.49s -> 1013.48s]  How do I use it? Oh, it just happens. I always love a good roguelike. What is that? Uh, well,
[1013.48s -> 1030.33s]  I'm doing the movement speed because this thing, this guy's fast. Jesus. Ow. Is there a block?
[1030.33s -> 1036.25s]  All right, I have to, I have to win. This is literally this, this is the tutorial boss.
[1036.25s -> 1059.26s]  I can't lose to this. Whoa. Oh my goodness. OK. Um, get rid of the adds. I need to level up.
[1059.26s -> 1065.78s]  Give me that scroll down there. What's up here? Give me the potion potion potion potion. That's
[1065.78s -> 1090.60s]  what that is for sure. Is this a damage buff? There it is. All right. Movement speed or just
[1090.60s -> 1105.02s]  straight up damage? Probably just damage right now. Trying to get him hit by the. Oh, I'm fine.
[1113.21s -> 1118.79s]  I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. All right. All right. Things are getting a lot harder
[1118.79s -> 1133.34s]  to kill. It's in the chest. I need more attack speed. A hundred percent. Give me that shit.
[1136.76s -> 1145.05s]  Give it to me. I can't. I'm just like swirling a drain right now. Oh, there's items. OK. This
[1145.05s -> 1153.13s]  just got way fucking cooler. This just got way cooler. 20% attack speed, 10% crit chance,
[1153.13s -> 1171.72s]  10% health. I mean, it's definitely this. Cool. Oh, I feel the speed bat chest. You can bat
[1171.72s -> 1179.14s]  chest all you want. You are totally in your right to bat chest whenever you want to bat chest.
[1179.14s -> 1188.60s]  But I'm going to disagree with your bat chest. Idiot. Sorry. I put that last part in there.
[1188.60s -> 1212.62s]  Probably the health. Yeah, just get the orbs up. I'm going to I'm going to go up the scroll.
[1213.26s -> 1224.95s]  I did two quests already. What the hell is bat chest? It means I don't I think this thing is
[1224.95s -> 1229.69s]  cringe and it's like lame. So I'm going to that's what that's supposed to mean. Right.
[1234.25s -> 1238.57s]  It's supposed to be like, oh, my God, I'm so excited for this thing. And like, it's cringy.
[1238.57s -> 1254.95s]  How excited I am. Right. Is that how it is? I'm just going to run down here. Oh, my God,
[1254.95s -> 1271.06s]  Jerma. Oh, my God, Jerma bat chest. Come on. This is getting crazy right now. I'm going to
[1271.06s -> 1289.91s]  try to wrap around this dude. Is this the Jerma stream? Oh, taking the health because I will die
[1289.91s -> 1309.62s]  if I don't click this. I like the sound effects at the very beginning of the intro, like right
[1309.62s -> 1315.54s]  when the thing loads up and you press start to play, it should go. Welcome to the halls of
[1315.86s -> 1326.86s]  men. They can just use that if they want. No, they can't. Never mind. What am I talking about?
[1326.86s -> 1341.94s]  Oh, health and movement speed. That helps. I miss that. I miss when games used to just yell their
[1341.94s -> 1354.87s]  title card. That was cool. Why do we get away from that? We replaced having an interesting
[1354.87s -> 1361.88s]  voice acting at the beginning that just yells the title of your game to like, I don't know,
[1362.12s -> 1369.98s]  climb up the tower and activate the radio as like every game now. Bring back the fucking
[1369.98s -> 1401.27s]  yelling the intro speed. Yeah. Dance Dance Revolution. Does it do it? Dragon Ball Z does
[1401.27s -> 1415.18s]  that too. Well, there's a lot of shit on the ground. I mean, these are all good, but which
[1415.18s -> 1425.94s]  one is the most good? Does Mario Kart still do it? Yeah. Does he still go Mario Kart? In Mario Kart,
[1425.94s -> 1430.34s]  they even go a step forward. Like another step beyond that. It's select your player.
[1431.64s -> 1438.36s]  Choose your character. Street Fighter does it right. Street Fighter six. Yeah. And of course,
[1438.36s -> 1442.68s]  you understand why Capcom is just absolutely killing it lately. They just they say all the
[1442.68s -> 1461.62s]  names of their games in their intro. I know a lot of you didn't think I was going to get this far
[1461.62s -> 1466.18s]  on my first run, but you have no idea how much I loved Vampire Survivors. It's like my favorite
[1466.18s -> 1480.79s]  video game. I'm going to say, well, let's go with the 70 health. Do you get to keep the items?
[1480.79s -> 1491.06s]  All right. This is the end here for sure. Yeah. Yep. OK. All right. Character level 18. Survival
[1491.06s -> 1502.31s]  12 minutes. You suck. You're supposed to die. They don't understand these games. All right.
[1502.31s -> 1509.59s]  What did I get? I unlocked the Archer. I unlocked under the stage. I got a new ability,
[1509.59s -> 1516.78s]  Ring Blades. And then I got a Shrine of Blessings. The next quest is to enter Ember Grounds and
[1516.78s -> 1524.39s]  rescue the Wellkeeper. Cool. I got a thousand bucks. I thought you did good. I thought I did
[1524.39s -> 1535.45s]  good, too. Let's do Archer. What's this? Oh, and there's a shitload of upgrades. OK,
[1535.45s -> 1545.64s]  this is probably permanent. Yeah, permanent. Probably this one. Attack range, pick up range,
[1545.64s -> 1555.82s]  movement speed. Oh, yeah. Let's go movement speed twice. Movement speed is just so important.
[1555.82s -> 1563.30s]  Register of Halls. Choose your destination in the Halls of Torment. Oh, OK. The next quest was here.
[1563.30s -> 1570.10s]  I don't think I'm going to do it yet. Let me look at that. Let me look at the missions. OK. Kill
[1570.10s -> 1575.61s]  five thousand enemies in one run. Deal seven hundred and fifty thousand damage with the orbs.
[1575.61s -> 1581.94s]  Deal seven hundred and fifty thousand damage with Phantom Needles. All right. So kill five
[1581.94s -> 1588.57s]  thousand enemies in one run. Sounds easy. Can you please comment on Quiznos? I like Quiznos.
[1588.57s -> 1596.15s]  I haven't had it in a long time, but I love it. I'll do. Yeah, let's go for it. Let's just do it
[1596.15s -> 1617.27s]  again. Can I have a turn now? No, it's my Xbox. This character seems very, very good. I'm telling
[1620.52s -> 1628.49s]  You got a PlayStation. I have the Xbox. Go play Demon's Souls or whatever is on that fucking
[1628.49s -> 1642.97s]  console. I'm on the Xbox. More speed. Is this game even on Xbox? No, it's not. I'm on PC.
[1652.42s -> 1663.74s]  Is it on Game Pass? I have all three. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, come on. I'm going to go just
[1663.74s -> 1680.92s]  all damage on this one. You can probably increase the projectiles. I hope so. I'm going to go pick
[1680.92s -> 1691.96s]  that parchment up, whatever that is. How do people play this with a mouse? If I was going
[1691.96s -> 1703.26s]  to play with controller, I would do auto aim. These are all kind of weak block strength. What
[1703.26s -> 1714.66s]  if you don't have a shield? I'll go defense. Aiming with the mouse is going to be always be
[1714.66s -> 1725.18s]  a thousand times easier than aiming with an analog. So I will probably play with the mouse
[1725.18s -> 1735.67s]  forever. All right. Let me go down this way. This is in VR. I'm the character down there.
[1735.67s -> 1753.14s]  I just don't know. I don't have the webcam on today. Oh, that's really good. Yeah. I'm just
[1753.38s -> 1759.64s]  I rented out a warehouse. I have like 50 or 60 thousand square feet here. So it's really
[1759.64s -> 1781.61s]  roomy here. That's why I can move around this much. I can't decide if I like this joke.
[1781.61s -> 1789.74s]  We have an undecided joke voter here. What do we do? What do we do to convince them?
[1789.74s -> 1810.34s]  Is there a map? You're doing your make shit up voice. It's so funny. We talked about this before,
[1811.06s -> 1821.29s]  but this is just the way I normally talk. Dude, why is he doing the bit voice? Oh,
[1821.37s -> 1824.41s]  it's just like the way the dude actually just like kind of talks normally.
[1835.48s -> 1856.10s]  Everything is a bit. I don't know if I'd say that. I just like having fun laughing my ass off the
[1856.10s -> 1860.34s]  other day. Do you remember when that guy did that zoom call thing where he got like beat up in an
[1860.34s -> 1870.84s]  octagon? Oh, yeah. You know, when you you okay, you know, when you see somebody do something and
[1870.84s -> 1883.80s]  you wish you made that joke. Let's do a text. You guys have never seen that video of the guys
[1883.80s -> 1888.68s]  that link in a zoom call and he's like a green screen behind him, like attached to a backpack
[1888.68s -> 1895.75s]  on him. And he's in like an octagon. He's getting like beat up in his zoom meeting.
[1895.75s -> 1904.81s]  You've never seen this. It's it's fucking insane. Show it. I don't even know how to look for it.
[1904.81s -> 1912.70s]  I just I just remember seeing it. Bro picked eight over 20 percent. Oh, shit. Hold on.
[1914.60s -> 1937.03s]  This is really good. I do want to get down to the parchment, though. It was during Covid.
[1942.17s -> 1960.47s]  It's so funny. What is this? Oh, it was a thing to get a quest for this. Fires needles at random
[1960.47s -> 1966.95s]  nearby enemies in quick succession. Multi hit increases the attack speed. I'll do it. I'm going
[1966.95s -> 1990.71s]  to need it right now. OK, multi hit. Go 10 percent damage. I need more piercing movement speed.
[1991.99s -> 2002.26s]  No, I need more. Yeah, let's keep going. Attack speed. One more level up and I'm going down to get
[2002.26s -> 2019.83s]  the ability or chance. You just made me buy this game. I mean, the game is fun. I mean, did you
[2019.83s -> 2025.43s]  open the stream and see this thing that may have been speaking to you and your gameplay preferences?
[2025.43s -> 2043.29s]  That's what that's what just happened. All right. I'm being stupid, but I want the experience.
[2043.29s -> 2051.88s]  I'm doing it for a reason. All right. These are all good. I don't know what to do.
[2051.88s -> 2071.62s]  You're a really good salesman. Um, I don't I do not think so. Uh, 20 percent crit damage seems
[2071.62s -> 2082.86s]  amazing, but so does attack speed. That's just this game sounds like I'm sorting through a Lego bin.
[2085.75s -> 2099.19s]  Kind of does. Like, where is that fucking little square with the two pegs on it?
[2100.34s -> 2106.79s]  And it needs to be green. This is why I keep saying I need to organize these fucking things.
[2107.43s -> 2114.34s]  I just throw them in here. How am I ever going to be able to finish the Millennium Falcon now?
[2116.58s -> 2150.20s]  Um, more health. Pick up range. I know it's lame, but I need it. Uh, give me the crits. Yep.
[2150.20s -> 2158.66s]  It's day 34. Can you wear a nun cosplay? Uh, this is day 34 of me telling you once on day 34,
[2158.66s -> 2164.10s]  the answer is no. So the next 6000 days of you asking this are going to be a waste of your time.
[2164.10s -> 2182.84s]  There's so much over here. I don't want to miss it. There's so many little crunchies over here.
[2183.48s -> 2194.44s]  Guard the middle. There we go. All right. Five percent crit, 20 percent crit damage. That's
[2194.44s -> 2223.29s]  amazing. I'm so good on health. This first boss seems really fun and challenging, but fair enough.
[2223.93s -> 2237.85s]  I like the first boss. What's this? Is this me reading?
[2250.89s -> 2256.68s]  All right. Do I get this or something? Do I have to do anything with that or is it just lore?
[2257.40s -> 2273.38s]  Somebody said not looking great, bro. What do you mean? Me playing? I'm doing fine.
[2274.10s -> 2277.38s]  I haven't gotten hit for three minutes. You're telling me it's not looking good for me?
[2277.38s -> 2281.13s]  It's been three minutes. I've taken a point of damage. That's got achievement for it.
[2286.89s -> 2297.51s]  Yes. All right. Give me that loot crit chance. 80 percent pick up range. It's definitely this one.
[2301.46s -> 2313.11s]  I mean, 10 percent crit. That's nothing can compare to that. Give me a speed. There we go.
[2313.51s -> 2318.15s]  One attack per second. One, two, three, four. There's even more than one per second.
[2318.87s -> 2332.36s]  All right. I'm getting too cocky. Don't be stupid. Go collect. All right. Now go down.
[2332.92s -> 2355.62s]  Wait, there's like trinkets here. Come on, level up. What am I lacking in right now? More attack
[2355.62s -> 2389.21s]  speed. That actually is kind of getting ugly. You're right. I'm going to turn on auto attack
[2389.21s -> 2396.02s]  while I collect. That's definitely the time to do it. Oh, wait a minute. It's auto attack, not auto
[2396.02s -> 2402.14s]  aim. That I'm really glad I figured that out. So I don't have to hold down left click. Oh,
[2402.14s -> 2411.82s]  that's a huge deal. That is a monumental deal. There's so much stuff over here, but
[2412.62s -> 2427.14s]  whatever. Just go for it. Give me, give me everything. Is it health or is it just more crit?
[2427.14s -> 2434.57s]  It's over believers. It might not be. I don't know if it's over yet. I'm going to take the health.
[2434.57s -> 2438.62s]  I know it's a lame upgrade, but it's effectively drinking a health potion
[2439.58s -> 2460.10s]  and it's gone already. I would have been dead. I need damage. I need piercing and I need damage
[2461.08s -> 2491.40s]  right now. I mean, that's good enough. Damage is damage. All right. I'm now I'm finally going to
[2491.40s -> 2512.86s]  leave. Uh, more damage. All right. Now I'm running. They're starting to need multiple hits with my
[2512.86s -> 2530.07s]  main weapon to die. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. He never picks up the regen lamp. What's the
[2530.07s -> 2538.66s]  region lamp? Is that a cool game feature that I haven't been interacting with? Don't tell him
[2538.66s -> 2545.86s]  that. What do you mean? Don't tell me that. He doesn't know about the regen lamp stand. Oh,
[2545.86s -> 2560.92s]  I thought that was a lamp. Walk over the fire. A lot of money. I'm missing out on a lot of
[2560.92s -> 2567.30s]  experience, but I don't care. I'm getting the other ability. Who knows how far away this is,
[2567.30s -> 2573.54s]  but whatever. Where's your movement speed to eight, eight milliseconds a second.
[2581.11s -> 2595.64s]  I'm going to hang on here for just a second. More damage. These guys drop a lot of experience.
[2595.64s -> 2602.12s]  This dude has an NA education. All right. Cause I'm just doing damage only. What do you mean?
[2602.92s -> 2623.70s]  This is where I lost last time. Already made more progress. Oh, give me, come on. Come on.
[2624.68s -> 2648.20s]  Yeah. Uh, I'm doing movement speed. These things are fast. I'm going to wrap around. There's a lot
[2648.20s -> 2667.91s]  of experience here. I don't even care if I die. When are you going to do the auto treat review
[2667.91s -> 2677.35s]  stream? Um, I don't know. I don't want to give auto too many treats. These are all kind of bad,
[2677.35s -> 2705.29s]  but I think I'll take this one. What's this? Ooh, he wants all the treats to himself.
[2705.29s -> 2713.56s]  You ever look at the back of a thing of dog treats or a thing of dog food and you go,
[2713.56s -> 2719.61s]  I could survive on this in the apocalypse. I'll be fine. You look at the ingredients list and
[2719.61s -> 2724.22s]  you're like, damn, okay. These like, these like really good treats for dogs. The,
[2724.22s -> 2742.89s]  I could probably eat these in the apocalypse. I'm going to run. Why did you not get damaged?
[2742.89s -> 2747.50s]  Cause I want to be running very fast because these things are fast and it's kind of freaking
[2747.50s -> 2758.25s]  me out. Remember avoiding damage means you can live longer to deal more damage. Defense
[2758.25s -> 2768.20s]  is directly translated to offense in a lot of these games that are in this genre. If you stay
[2768.20s -> 2782.09s]  alive for 10 minutes, you'll do more damage than if you stayed alive for eight, thus increasing
[2782.09s -> 2804.55s]  your score. All right. This big skeleton has to go. All right. 30% more 5% crit. Yep. Are you
[2804.55s -> 2813.75s]  guys doing the longer the enemy lives, the more damage it does to you. But if you don't get hit
[2816.12s -> 2830.87s]  and get good, as they say, all right, there goes the, Oh, that was just his shield.
[2830.87s -> 2836.55s]  His shield is the only thing I killed. Oh, that's not funny. Uh, this might be the end.
[2844.06s -> 2848.46s]  That's at some point I'm going to be at like, I'm pretty much at like 60, 50% crit or something.
[2848.46s -> 2865.66s]  Aren't I? Something kind of crazy. He needs a better gaming chair. No, I, I actually really
[2865.66s -> 2882.18s]  don't. I'm doing just fine. What do you mean? I'm doing fine. I gotta get rid of this thing.
[2882.18s -> 2896.89s]  Come on. All right. There we go. Can't get it yet. Uh, moving speed and help. What about, yeah, no
[2897.45s -> 2907.16s]  moving speed and help. That second boss has to die. Give me the other ability.
[2908.87s -> 2915.34s]  Ring blades throws blades left and right and alternation blades act like boomerangs passing
[2915.34s -> 2922.55s]  the character and then flying off screen. Multi-hit increases the frequency of throwing blades.
[2922.55s -> 2928.92s]  Lightning strike is random. I imagine it's just like in vampire survivors, stuns enemies for a
[2928.92s -> 2935.32s]  brief period. Stun enemies can't move, right? Electricity electrified deals damage. 100 each
[2935.32s -> 2941.32s]  tick based on the amount of stacks. Ooh, that was a big, that was a bad one. Each stack decreases
[2941.32s -> 2946.66s]  the tick time. When electrified ticks, it is reduced by one stack. I didn't read that. I
[2946.66s -> 2961.72s]  didn't comprehend any of that. I'm going to go with ring blades. No lightning. He's so drunk.
[2962.92s -> 2969.75s]  Yeah, that was like a, Hey, I just, um, can somebody read this for me?
[2970.95s -> 2988.70s]  Like the drunk Looney Tunes character. Uh, I'm getting close to dying and I would have died
[2988.70s -> 3000.10s]  right there. If, what is this? It comes with a negative. I mean, we're just going with this.
[3000.66s -> 3006.18s]  It's 30% more damage. Are you kidding me? All right. I can stay alive. I'm going to be quiet.
[3006.82s -> 3032.18s]  I actually don't want to die. All right. I unlocked a new wind crown, piercing wind.
[3032.74s -> 3045.78s]  They get 500 bucks. Cool. All right. I, what do I, what do I, let's try sword again.
[3050.04s -> 3066.42s]  I got, I killed 3,600 enemies in one run. Not quite there. Now it's just, uh, I'm going to do
[3066.42s -> 3081.02s]  the other stage. I think that unlocks more stuff. Yeah. Rescue the wellkeeper. All right. Go for it.
[3081.02s -> 3096.92s]  Auto aim is toggleable too. That's really cool. All right. Let's go for it. Ooh, this is harder.
[3096.92s -> 3107.34s]  They have a lot more health. I just break them out. I love this avatar.
[3112.26s -> 3131.16s]  See what I can do. You can't die, right? He must be nearby. I have to level up a few times.
[3134.57s -> 3142.36s]  Everybody does not believe right now. Um, I mean, this is a new level. This is harder than the first
[3142.36s -> 3149.32s]  one. And this is a rogue like with permanent upgrades. I'm going to say, I don't know if I
[3149.32s -> 3154.34s]  would be betting on the yes right now, maybe a few runs, but who knows? What if I do really good and
[3154.34s -> 3176.30s]  you make a huge amount of channel points? I'm going to go tank. Ooh, key. They're manageable.
[3180.26s -> 3212.52s]  Oh, I didn't upgrade last time. It's all right. Try to hit as many as possible damage. Yeah.
[3213.40s -> 3222.17s]  You don't have any precision, dude. Um, I don't, you don't need precision in a game like this.
[3222.17s -> 3228.87s]  It's about surviving waves and mowing down. I don't know why I keep saying that. It's because
[3229.67s -> 3233.75s]  it's cause that's like the thing that kind of looks like the Diablo thing, like mowing down
[3233.75s -> 3237.75s]  waves of enemies, mowing down monsters. And I sit here and ask myself, when did I,
[3237.75s -> 3255.67s]  have I ever cared about that in Diablo? Like I've never have ever. Um, okay. Back speed. Remember,
[3255.67s -> 3265.50s]  these are people. Well, they're well, we're in hell. So, okay. What do you want to say?
[3267.46s -> 3278.74s]  Uh, cone size. Yep. It's devil spawn. These are not people. These are devil spawn. What are you
[3278.74s -> 3290.20s]  talking about? No, this is the, this is the non completely nondescript bad guy character.
[3290.76s -> 3295.16s]  So you never have to feel anything about like, oh, what am I killing here? Because they're like,
[3297.08s -> 3303.08s]  yes, murder and torture and killing. Like this, you don't feel bad. You can't feel bad about
[3303.08s -> 3308.20s]  killing like demon imps. They've, we've specifically been told this for like the last a hundred years
[3308.20s -> 3313.70s]  of any like media and video games and anything. It's just, oh, these things are just evil creatures
[3313.70s -> 3318.65s]  that hurt stuff. And we're also led to believe that they can just be kind of created, just like
[3318.65s -> 3333.67s]  snap. Oh, there's like another 2000 of them. I didn't even read that last part. Hey dude,
[3333.67s -> 3349.53s]  can you find Ben Franklin and that person for an hour? This, I have not hurt this guy yet. Uh,
[3350.41s -> 3379.59s]  more cone. You actually ban him. What are your thoughts on POE? I mean, I'm excited to play it.
[3383.22s -> 3389.82s]  The, okay. So POE, let me go over this. So I've played a little bit of lost dark. I played a
[3389.82s -> 3395.48s]  little bit of POE. I've played obviously a lot of Diablo, but my concern with something like POE,
[3395.48s -> 3400.70s]  and this is what I've talked to stir about this a few times. Uh, my concern was always,
[3401.42s -> 3406.62s]  it's not that it's overwhelming. It's that there is just such an unbelievable amount of content
[3406.62s -> 3412.46s]  that I'm going to accidentally open up one of the menus for said content and have, and gets
[3412.46s -> 3416.70s]  freaked out. It's kind of like when you open up one of these MMO type games or these like kind of
[3416.70s -> 3421.74s]  live service games after a while of not playing. And the game is just like, Hey, you've missed,
[3421.74s -> 3427.98s]  um, literally like seven years of patches and updates and changes. Uh, here's like 10 pop-up
[3427.98s -> 3433.42s]  windows to explain to you every massive, monumental fucking ridiculous change we've made over the last
[3433.42s -> 3446.34s]  five years. It's just, I don't even know where to start. I want to start. And it's not an excuse
[3446.34s -> 3451.30s]  because there's plenty of, you know, if you really care, you'll do it. But I think it was just the
[3452.02s -> 3458.26s]  prospect of not ever paid paying attention and having to, and even the stuff they were
[3458.26s -> 3463.14s]  talking about at exile con was like, Holy shit, this is so cool. You can make a rogue like dungeon
[3463.14s -> 3468.26s]  and trade it. And wait, this is, they're bringing this back. Oh, by the way, like stir was telling
[3468.26s -> 3473.70s]  me there's like, there's like 15 different end game, like whole zones to like care about and
[3473.70s -> 3478.10s]  like make a character around. Oh, by the way, there's like 7,000 uniques in the game. Oh,
[3478.10s -> 3480.90s]  it's like, Holy shit. That sounds like the, that sounds like my favorite game ever made.
[3481.62s -> 3488.38s]  My favorite game ever made is D2. It's just a fact. It just is what I liked about D2. That's
[3488.38s -> 3497.37s]  not in a lot of the ARPGs now is it's incredible simplicity. It was very simple. It was very easy
[3497.37s -> 3506.26s]  to understand, but like I could be an item fine barbarian if I wanted to. I think that's what I
[3506.26s -> 3511.14s]  liked the most about it is there's like 30 moves. This character has, do you want to be a Raven
[3511.14s -> 3516.87s]  Druid? I mean, is that stupid? Maybe, but who cares? Put 20 points into it and have fun. I'm,
[3516.87s -> 3525.38s]  that's what I'm looking for. D2 was the worst Diablo game. I mean, you're literally talking about
[3525.38s -> 3529.62s]  like my, like my entire identity is based around this game. So like you're, that's a personal
[3529.62s -> 3543.24s]  attack, not doom too. That was a, that was a personal, no, not destiny to Diablo too. What
[3547.51s -> 3556.14s]  D2 Diablo to not destiny to, I played a little bit of destiny too. It was fun. It was all right. I
[3556.14s -> 3564.97s]  didn't, I didn't really get into it, but I could understand why people played it. But I thought
[3564.97s -> 3571.61s]  about this the other day. What is it about seeing the beige kind of beige golden letters on the
[3571.61s -> 3577.88s]  ground? It's the fact that I kind of don't even know what it is. And even if it sucks, who cares?
[3577.88s -> 3584.73s]  It's got like cool artwork and I can give that to like my level three Amazon. It's like a level
[3584.73s -> 3590.70s]  five unique. And the thing's a piece of shit. The thing sucks, but who cares? It's like a fun
[3590.70s -> 3596.23s]  little thing to collect and it's got a custom art for each little piece. I can, I can keep it
[3596.23s -> 3608.07s]  in a little inventory. Everything feels like handmade. It all feels handmade. What don't you
[3608.07s -> 3614.25s]  like about D4's uniques? First of all, there's like, when I played D, I played a lot of D4 off
[3614.25s -> 3616.89s]  stream. I really did. I'll give you my real, I'm going to give you the real take cause I know I've
[3616.89s -> 3624.60s]  been, you know, I haven't been given you the real one. I just don't like the aspects. I just,
[3624.60s -> 3628.44s]  I just really don't like that system. I haven't liked the legendary system since D3
[3629.40s -> 3640.14s]  and they leaned even more heavily into it. I would rather instead of legendaries with legendary
[3640.14s -> 3645.02s]  powers, just get rid of that entire system and just have like three fucking hundred uniques in
[3645.02s -> 3648.62s]  the game and have them all fun and interesting and have them unique and have them have cool artwork
[3648.62s -> 3653.50s]  and let me collect them. That's it. That's what I want. That's what I want. That's all I wanted.
[3654.14s -> 3659.27s]  And then somebody would just say, just play D2. Yeah, that's true. D2 got remastered and the
[3659.27s -> 3667.88s]  remaster is very, very good. Yeah. You're right. You're right. You're absolutely right. But I've
[3667.88s -> 3673.80s]  kind of been waiting for a D2 sequel for like 30 years. Do you know what I mean? It's just like,
[3673.80s -> 3681.24s]  God damn it. I just want, I want D2 more. I want like D2 too. Does that make me an old boomer?
[3681.24s -> 3692.82s]  Probably, but that's just how I feel. That's Diablo 3. Diablo 3 is not Diablo 2 too. Diablo 3
[3692.82s -> 3699.67s]  is the base for Diablo 4, which is why I prefer Diablo 2. The Diablo 2 item system, I think,
[3699.67s -> 3705.29s]  and plus I think about gems. I like to just collect them and you could make them and it's like,
[3705.29s -> 3713.08s]  oh wow, I've got like five perfect topazes. Throw that shit into a five, six socket chest,
[3713.08s -> 3717.24s]  give yourself some magic fine and go have a goddamn fucking fun time killing Mephisto
[3717.24s -> 3726.01s]  four times in a row. Who cares? POE has gems. I'm going to play POE. I'm going to play it.
[3726.01s -> 3736.60s]  German, none of those words are in the Bible. No, they're not. Are they? Is the word gem? It
[3736.60s -> 3747.99s]  might be. In my honest opinion, Diablo 4 kind of, they kind of just made this game where it was
[3747.99s -> 3752.15s]  just, it wasn't about the fact that they made the game. It was the fact that they wanted you to just
[3752.15s -> 3757.67s]  play it. It wasn't about making the game. It was about making sure you play it. Do you understand
[3757.67s -> 3763.50s]  what I mean by that? Does anybody get that? Like, do you, does anybody understand what I mean by
[3763.50s -> 3776.95s]  that? It's not about the game being good. It's about making sure you play it. And let me be very,
[3776.95s -> 3782.23s]  very clear. I do think that the Diablo 4 devs really do want to have a good game. I think they
[3782.23s -> 3786.79s]  really want to make a great experience. And you know what? Over the next few years, they probably
[3786.79s -> 3793.83s]  will. They'll probably make a pretty fleshed out end game system. But the core of Diablo 4, the very
[3793.83s -> 3803.19s]  fundamentals of that game, I do not like. So I, I don't, Diablo 2, I don't think I'm, I don't think
[3803.19s -> 3818.02s]  I'm ever going to get the sequel that I ever really wanted. And that's all right. Oh my God, gone are
[3818.02s -> 3830.33s]  the days of centrist Andy. No, but that's just how I feel. That's just the truth of how I feel.
[3831.13s -> 3837.16s]  There are a lot of people that really, really liked D4. I'm not going to tell you that you are
[3837.16s -> 3841.80s]  stupid or wrong for liking D4 a lot. I'm not going to say that to you because if you like it, then
[3841.80s -> 3847.43s]  you like it. I'm not going to tell you that you can't like it. I'm just going to tell you that I
[3847.43s -> 3866.63s]  don't. Okay. You already said that. That I, wait, when did I say that? I'm going to die. But nothing
[3866.63s -> 3874.07s]  will ever hit the same as finding, you know, and I want to identify items. I want to identify items.
[3875.11s -> 3881.11s]  Do you know what I mean? I don't want to just pick up a bunch of shit and just have it be like
[3881.11s -> 3887.11s]  just a mess in my inventory. And it's just green and red letters. And which one is green letters?
[3887.11s -> 3891.27s]  Which has red letters? How many, what, what, how many percent? Everything has a percentage on it.
[3891.27s -> 3895.59s]  Everything's a percentage percentage to percentage of a percentage to this percentage. So I don't
[3895.59s -> 3898.63s]  want to see, I just, I want real numbers. I don't want percentages. Give me a number.
[3900.42s -> 3910.63s]  I'm going off. I don't want it like the 20% chance to do 10% more vulnerability damage. If you have
[3910.63s -> 3917.70s]  10% more, no, I just give me, I want 25 dexterity on that item. And I want the art to look really
[3917.70s -> 3921.78s]  cool. Cause there's a lot of talented artists and shit. And I want it to have beige letters. And I
[3921.78s -> 3927.78s]  want to have a big collection box where I can put these items and I want to trade them. I want to
[3927.78s -> 3932.58s]  be able to fucking, I want to be able to, I lost, but whatever. He's still going. Okay.
[3937.86s -> 3946.09s]  Nobody talks shit about Diablo more than somebody that says Diablo is my favorite game. Yeah,
[3946.65s -> 3952.25s]  you got, okay. You've got me here. You do got me, but let me tell you, let me just try to make it
[3952.25s -> 3961.58s]  as clear as I can. Diablo two was just such a, was such an unbelievable genre defining experience.
[3961.58s -> 3967.29s]  Like nothing really was ever really like that. There was a couple things kind of, but it just,
[3967.29s -> 3975.10s]  they just paved the whole road for every action RPG that came after it. And it's hard to play
[3975.10s -> 3980.94s]  a game that's supposed to be a Diablo sequel, Diablo two, Diablo three, a numbered sequel.
[3980.94s -> 3988.20s]  And have, in my opinion, they go so far away from what made me like Diablo so much that it's not
[3988.20s -> 3997.88s]  really even a numbered sequel for me anymore. PoE is better than D2. I think PoE has had a lot more
[3997.88s -> 4004.50s]  time of to be developed. Diablo two was, was done by Blizzard North. They just kind of made the game
[4004.50s -> 4007.54s]  and it released. There wasn't like a bunch. I mean, they did patches and they added stuff and that
[4007.54s -> 4013.14s]  like ladder and everything and D2, the expansion, everything. But PoE has been continuously developed
[4013.14s -> 4023.46s]  for about 10 years. Who is he talking to? Um, you. I'm talking to you. How can you call yourself a
[4023.46s -> 4029.54s]  Diablo fan when you dislike 75% of Diablo games? I don't, I don't dislike Diablo one. I think Diablo
[4029.54s -> 4035.96s]  one was almost like an experiment. I think Diablo two was the first like Diablo is a big game that
[4035.96s -> 4043.34s]  everybody cares about now. I think Diablo one was more of like an awesome experiment. All right,
[4043.34s -> 4047.11s]  I'm going for it. I want to do the first mission. I feel like I was doing pretty good in that one.
[4047.11s -> 4057.48s]  Diablo one's a good time. Yeah. All right. I'm going for it this time. I'm going to go right to
[4057.48s -> 4071.30s]  the scroll. I like random. I just don't like everything is random and everything is random
[4071.30s -> 4076.90s]  to an extent. Let me give you an example. I know, I know this is like, finally he like took, he like
[4076.90s -> 4082.41s]  is, he's finally giving his Diablo four take. I know, but it's been a while. It's been a long
[4082.41s -> 4089.58s]  time coming. Uh, what was I, what was I just going to say? I actually just forgot everything. What
[4089.58s -> 4095.10s]  was the last sentence I said? What was the last sentence I said? I'm, I was like looking at reading
[4095.10s -> 4100.81s]  the, um, the thing up there. What was the last thing I said? Random. Okay. Random. Yeah. I like
[4100.81s -> 4105.96s]  random, but I don't like when things are too random, but they're random in a box. Let me give you an
[4105.96s -> 4114.20s]  example. For instance, in D four, if I wanted to make like a charged bolt, a charged bolt sorcerer
[4114.20s -> 4122.25s]  sorceress, right there, there are items in the game that completely change charge bolts, right?
[4122.25s -> 4128.09s]  There's also, you can get us to charge bolts on a pair of gloves or I think it's legs, whatever it
[4128.09s -> 4134.65s]  is, but that can only appear on a certain couple pieces of gear. Why can't it roll on everything
[4134.65s -> 4140.68s]  else? Why can't plus to charge bolts roll on anything? Why does it have to roll on like one
[4140.68s -> 4151.35s]  item only in one specific slot? Why? What if I want to try to get like a bunch of points into
[4151.35s -> 4159.35s]  charge bolts? Why can't I just put it on a bunch of shit? And every item seems to like, I don't know,
[4159.35s -> 4162.79s]  just feels like when I do a bunch of runs, like, oh, I'm going to do some nightmare dungeons and
[4162.79s -> 4168.38s]  then I'm going to do the hell tide or whatever. All right, cool. I have a full inventory of shit
[4168.38s -> 4172.78s]  of like a bunch of legendaries and rares and, and now you go, you scroll over to me like,
[4172.78s -> 4176.14s]  I don't even know what the fuck half of this shit even is saying to me. Like, what, what,
[4176.14s -> 4181.67s]  what even is better? I don't just salvage the whole inventory. This is like, I guess, I mean,
[4181.67s -> 4188.42s]  I found the distant enemies are stunned like eight times and I guess I'm just going to keep one of
[4188.42s -> 4194.44s]  them. I had a full inventory. I had a full stash of aspects that I was just like, these are all,
[4194.44s -> 4200.97s]  I don't even know what the fuck to do with these. Dude, stop being a nerd. People are leaving. Hey,
[4200.97s -> 4204.97s]  I've been pressed to give my Diablo four take for like two months and I haven't given it and I'm
[4204.97s -> 4219.62s]  giving it to you now. TLDR in Diablo two, even when a piece of shit unique drops, you just see
[4219.62s -> 4226.07s]  the beige letters and you go, Ooh, when like a legendary ring drops in D four, I don't even
[4226.07s -> 4231.56s]  fucking care. I just don't, I don't even care. It's just like, Oh, that's just going to be a
[4231.56s -> 4236.82s]  bunch of random stats and a random aspect. I don't even care. And you pick it up and she's like,
[4236.82s -> 4241.54s]  okay, is this like 1% better than the one aspect of this that I already have? I don't know. I guess
[4242.10s -> 4257.99s]  throw it away. I guess your TLDR is way too long. Is beige really a deal breaker? Yeah,
[4257.99s -> 4266.95s]  it kind of is. And because to me asked that it matters a lot to me. I want to be able to like
[4266.95s -> 4272.79s]  pick that item up. Like what was that big mall in D two bone snap, right? It was, it was in,
[4273.59s -> 4278.73s]  when you identify it, it like, well, there's the artwork, right? Remember that shit. Remember that
[4278.73s -> 4284.01s]  shit. Hey, remember that shit. Remember when you, you, you've, you actually identified it
[4284.01s -> 4289.10s]  and the artwork showed up. Give me, give me, I want the items to be, have like, wait, I want
[4289.10s -> 4292.94s]  them to fucking have visuals. I don't want them just to be like a bunch of fucking rolled stats.
[4292.94s -> 4302.25s]  I don't give a shit about any of that. I don't care about any of that. Go get the scroll. Oh yeah,
[4302.25s -> 4308.25s]  I will do the D four ramp, but do it in a quagmire voice now. Hey, so I mean,
[4308.57s -> 4315.53s]  Hey, Hey, Peter, so Diablo four. Oh, right. It's, it's actually kind of a, I'm not a big fan of it.
[4334.15s -> 4342.82s]  That hurt me physically worse than the Deadpool routine. I, you know, I, I will stand by the
[4342.82s -> 4347.46s]  Deadpool routine. I thought that was a good time. I think some of you are hating on the Deadpool
[4347.46s -> 4351.46s]  routine and you don't even, you don't even, you didn't get it. I don't think you got it. You didn't
[4351.46s -> 4358.33s]  get it. I just don't think you got it. I, you know what I mean? I really think you just didn't
[4358.33s -> 4363.69s]  get it. Yeah. Some of you got it, but a lot of you didn't. And a lot of you like hate my Deadpool.
[4363.69s -> 4383.29s]  Let me get it. I was reeling in pain. Yeah, it's all right. All right. I'm going to get the scroll.
[4383.29s -> 4393.91s]  I'm not, wait, let's read this. Let us into the darkness. Brines awaited with a sacrifice in
[4393.91s -> 4404.92s]  exchange for a fragment of the token trade its old master to finally end his atrocious reign.
[4410.42s -> 4424.76s]  Go get the scroll, Madge. I'm going, I'll get it. I am 100% going to play POE 2. I will. POE 1,
[4424.76s -> 4428.68s]  when the new league comes out. I'll definitely check it out. I already played a little bit of
[4428.68s -> 4432.28s]  Path of Exile just because, you know, obviously stir plays a lot and he's like, this is my
[4432.28s -> 4437.08s]  favorite game. Please. I know you like D2. Please for the love of God play it. Why do you keep not
[4437.08s -> 4441.96s]  playing this? You keep saying D2 is your favorite game ever. Why won't you play the game that is
[4441.96s -> 4447.48s]  supposed to be a successor to that game you love so much? Why there's like 70, there's like 10
[4447.48s -> 4454.55s]  years worth of content. You'll never get to the end of it. And I go, I'm maybe with a D Diablo 4
[4454.55s -> 4463.90s]  might patch in and some more uniques. It's not, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen.
[4463.90s -> 4470.22s]  When I heard that Diablo 4 was bringing uniques back, I rejoiced. I was like, we are going back
[4470.22s -> 4478.79s]  to the old Diablo 2 style. It's going to be uniques. It's going to be so, oh, our aspects are back.
[4478.79s -> 4484.15s]  And they just, you can pull them off and you have to stick them on a rare. And then like everything's
[4484.15s -> 4488.94s]  kind of like, there's no value on anything. And you can't even trade with somebody in your own
[4488.94s -> 4493.77s]  fucking party. And trading doesn't matter anyways, cause you get the same piece of gear over and over
[4493.77s -> 4507.91s]  again. Cause it's like the smart loot with the class and then everything's scaled and which is
[4507.91s -> 4517.18s]  one of the good ones here. I just want crafted items back. You're always complaining, dude.
[4517.18s -> 4524.78s]  Enjoy yourself once. I don't think I'm complaining a lot. I'm always, what? No, I'm not. I give a
[4524.78s -> 4541.58s]  lot of benefit of the doubt to a lot of games. I'll try. Yeah. I'll do ring blades. All right.
[4541.58s -> 4545.18s]  Now I actually, I'm going to level up one more time and I'm going to go get the thing down there.
[4545.82s -> 4559.11s]  It's so funny because you remember when I played the default beta on stream, I was going into that
[4559.11s -> 4566.55s]  with woo. Uh, yeah. I remember saying very, very clearly, it was like, this feels kind of fun.
[4567.19s -> 4571.11s]  The first five to 10 levels of D four, I was like, holy shit, this is going to be the best game I've
[4571.11s -> 4575.21s]  ever played in my entire life. I didn't want to say it on stream because I don't, I didn't want
[4575.21s -> 4580.47s]  to be like, you know, jumping the gun, right? Turns out it was not the case at all. It was
[4580.47s -> 4594.46s]  almost the complete opposite. And I remember saying on stream, hold on. I love this, but I don't,
[4594.46s -> 4598.78s]  I got to be really careful. I don't, what if I, let me give it some more time. I'm so glad I said
[4598.78s -> 4614.86s]  that. All I remember from that was grip gate. You know, that's like part of that makes me kind of
[4614.86s -> 4620.14s]  happy because well, like the weird dumb shit that we talk about on these streams, the fact that the
[4620.14s -> 4624.06s]  one thing that you remembered from that whole thing was not the fact that of like my opinion
[4624.06s -> 4630.70s]  of Diablo, it was the fact that we talked about like somebody's grip and nothing else mattered on
[4630.70s -> 4636.30s]  that stream. Right? So like, we go over a lot on these streams and it's kind of almost refreshing
[4636.30s -> 4639.74s]  to know that the only thing that you particularly care about is like me talking about somebody's
[4639.74s -> 4660.74s]  grip. You wanted to say Cyclops drip. Yeah. And my compressor cut it off. All right. Now I'm
[4660.74s -> 4668.47s]  actually officially going to go get the archment. I know people like bring back room words. I don't,
[4668.47s -> 4672.23s]  I don't really necessarily care too much about room words. I just want the, I want the socketable
[4672.23s -> 4681.10s]  items to feel good. It didn't feel bad putting a shitty ass chipped ass gem in some piece of
[4681.10s -> 4686.39s]  shit gear that you knew you were going to use for like five levels. That was actually useful.
[4687.03s -> 4691.67s]  I almost feel like the whole gem system in D4 is completely fucking meaningless.
[4691.67s -> 4704.82s]  It is 100% meaningless. Maybe one of them are like, I'm giving you my D4 take. I feel like your rant
[4704.82s -> 4712.17s]  is meaningless. I mean, I guess it kind of is. But don't you think my rant about like what kind
[4712.17s -> 4718.62s]  of peanut butter is my favorite is also pretty meaningless? I mean, I guess this has a little
[4718.62s -> 4736.41s]  bit of substance. Okay. Definitely the orbs. These things are awesome. That would be more entertaining.
[4737.61s -> 4753.82s]  Yeah. I'm telling you how I feel. That's what I'm doing. All right. Give me something good.
[4757.83s -> 4760.79s]  1% attack speed for five seconds for each killed enemy.
[4763.03s -> 4772.84s]  That feels great. It's that one, right? It has to be. Yeah, that thing's amazing. Every time you
[4772.84s -> 4786.87s]  kill something for five seconds, up to 50%. Is there an indicator where I can see it? Oh, it's
[4786.87s -> 4796.38s]  up here on the right. Oh, I need more damage because I'm not killing things fast enough.
[4802.25s -> 4810.65s]  Attack speed. Will you ever do a second run of choose your own Diablo in Diablo? Sorry,
[4810.65s -> 4815.66s]  hold on. That was pretty fun. Hardcore where you guys pick there at every point I put in
[4817.58s -> 4844.90s]  with D2 remastered. That's much, much easier to do now. Boy, this might be bad. Oh, come on.
[4844.90s -> 4851.51s]  Damn it. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I never got the key to that cage. Okay.
[4852.31s -> 4863.51s]  I got money. How much do I have? I got, oh my God, I have tons of money. I have 4,300 gold.
[4867.14s -> 4873.69s]  Maybe defense. Max health defense. Try to get it to last a little longer. Pack range.
[4874.33s -> 4883.74s]  I'm going to say this one. Let's do area and projectile speed. That's not what that said.
[4887.03s -> 4907.90s]  24% bigger projectile. I think that's pretty good. All right, let's go. All right. I'm going to go
[4907.90s -> 4918.74s]  rescue that guy in the cage. Don't skip plus one piercing. Yeah, we were talking about Diablo. That's
[4918.74s -> 4935.54s]  my bad. Oh yeah. We were talking about gems. We were talking about gems, gems, gems. Let's talk
[4935.54s -> 4944.31s]  about gems. I remember when you start D2, it's just you're going to use your gems. You're going
[4944.31s -> 4950.79s]  to put the flawed topaz in this busted up piece of shit, one-handed acts you found and you're going
[4950.79s -> 4958.63s]  to get a little bit of lightning damage and you're going to notice it. Here we go again.
[4963.43s -> 4969.35s]  Oh, okay. All right. Give me another topic. Give me another topic. Give me another topic. Geez,
[4969.35s -> 4974.60s]  man. You're still on. It's been like an hour. What do you want to talk about? Talk about Wendy's?
[4975.24s -> 4993.40s]  I like their nuggets. What's the best jam for peanut butter? That would be grape jelly or
[4993.40s -> 5002.26s]  grape jam. In fact, I haven't had it in a long time, but they make this product
[5002.82s -> 5011.50s]  where it's this weird spiral of 50-50 peanut butter and grape jam inside the same container.
[5011.50s -> 5018.20s]  And there was a point when I was eating that shit out of the jar. I was eating it out of the jar
[5018.20s -> 5023.58s]  for like 30 straight minutes and I realized what was going on and I had to stop it.
[5023.58s -> 5035.02s]  Goobers. Yeah. N.A. food. N.A. food. All right. Yeah. Well, hey, how can you take your crisps and
[5035.02s -> 5053.75s]  get the fuck out of here? All right. I'm going to eat Goobers out of the jar. Okay.
[5065.96s -> 5076.81s]  He's really patriotic today. Uh, I've ran. I've just we've I've just discussed Diablo
[5076.81s -> 5081.05s]  two's item system and I eat peanut butter out of the jar. Does that make me an American?
[5081.69s -> 5085.93s]  Is that an American thing? Is that patriotism? Is that patriotic?
[5089.03s -> 5095.42s]  Let me tell you something about Diablo. Hey, give me that jar of peanut butter while I go over this.
[5111.26s -> 5130.81s]  What's some good British food? Beans, right? Nothing. The only thing I think of when I think
[5130.81s -> 5138.41s]  of British food is just like two big fucking sausages on a plate with a bunch of plain beans
[5138.41s -> 5146.30s]  on it. And like, that's it. That's like what I think of. But I would eat that. That sounds
[5146.30s -> 5152.74s]  pretty damn good. Like, that's fine. I would be okay with that. That's this is not an insult to
[5152.74s -> 5158.26s]  an entire country of people's food. No, I'm just I'm that's what I think of. I think of like two big
[5158.26s -> 5169.30s]  sausages and like plain beans and I think a toast plain toast that that that sounds pretty good to
[5169.30s -> 5182.10s]  me. Remember the cage. Right. Right. Right. I get it. I get it. I get it. Scones. All right. Who has
[5182.10s -> 5202.76s]  the best desserts? Who has the best desserts? France. France has the best desserts. I would say
[5202.76s -> 5228.23s]  I would say Italy. No, no, no, no. America and Mexico. Yeah. I mean, I I'm trying to think of
[5228.23s -> 5232.87s]  what my like really favorite desserts are. And they are kind of American. Unless like where did
[5233.75s -> 5239.96s]  like banana cream pie, for instance, who made that up? Where did who made the first banana
[5239.96s -> 5258.86s]  cream pie? Who did that? Who? What country did it originate from? That's your go to dessert. I love
[5258.86s -> 5265.91s]  banana banana cream pie and banana pudding are two of my top desserts ever. And those of you that oh
[5265.91s -> 5272.39s]  my god, are you 80? Oh, yeah. Slurp up the banana pudding, right? Oh, man. No, you you've never
[5272.39s -> 5277.03s]  eaten it. You've seen a bunch of old people eat it and you laugh at them. But go eat it. Eat it next
[5277.03s -> 5285.51s]  time. And then you then you come back and talk. I know I walked by the guy in the cage, but I really
[5285.51s -> 5293.34s]  want I want the abilities first. I believe to have originated in the Midwest of the United States.
[5293.34s -> 5303.11s]  OK, so that's American. It's great, too. Oh, what else? I mean, like ice cream. I love ice cream.
[5303.91s -> 5312.57s]  Who doesn't, though? And who even made up ice cream? Anybody even know what ice cream be?
[5312.57s -> 5330.18s]  Where was where was ice cream invented? China, ancient Chinese planted the first seeds of
[5330.18s -> 5347.48s]  modern day ice cream. OK, 600 A.D. in China. I love ice cream. All right, let's go collect and
[5347.48s -> 5365.32s]  then I'll get this archman and then we'll go get I have 28 health. What happened? Ice cream. What
[5365.32s -> 5377.80s]  else? What else is like another thing up there in a cream pie? Just like a good chocolate ice cream.
[5377.80s -> 5386.14s]  All right, I'm going to go this way here. Tiramisu Tiramisu is really good, but I don't know if I
[5386.14s -> 5400.60s]  would say Tiramisu is my is my favorite dessert. OK, that's like the thing in vampire survivors.
[5400.60s -> 5412.50s]  Oh, speed. What is this gigantic pickup range? This is ridiculous. Oh, my God. I want region.
[5413.22s -> 5437.26s]  Oh, that sucks. Oh, that sucks. That sucks. That's hard. Oh, I got a blessing. Health. OK,
[5437.26s -> 5442.30s]  all right. Now I'm going to open. I'll open that cage now. I'm going to go with melee.
[5442.30s -> 5460.15s]  You suck at this. That's fine. That's fine. I don't care. Defense. Health regen. Wait, I want
[5463.74s -> 5479.58s]  much more of that. All right, let's go. Area size is really good. Yeah, I need to do cone size.
[5479.58s -> 5483.64s]  First of all, let me go talk to the guy. Let me do the actual mission.
[5488.12s -> 5508.14s]  What instrument is that? The thing that goes. What is that thing? I want more regen. I want to be.
[5508.14s -> 5512.14s]  I want to be regening like one health, two health a second.
[5512.14s -> 5514.42s]  We're going to work on that first while it's easy.
[5526.50s -> 5540.97s]  OK, let's get this done immediately. Don't free him. Keep him there. What's with you? What's with
[5540.97s -> 5549.56s]  you? I think having more than four or five slots for gems in Diablo three and Diablo two is like
[5549.56s -> 5555.50s]  probably the best part about having the gem system. And I'm kidding. I'm not. I got you.
[5555.50s -> 5568.38s]  Got you. Got you. Got you. But no, seriously, like I'll seriously the one to two slots per
[5569.18s -> 5573.18s]  it's just you've designed it in a way to make it so it can never be interesting.
[5573.82s -> 5578.78s]  It has to be this this this calculated thing that you've done where you can have one thing put in
[5578.78s -> 5585.62s]  this very specific box of randomness. I want to be able to throw six perfect fucking topazes
[5585.62s -> 5591.54s]  into a weapon and waste it and be an idiot. I want six perfect emeralds and a shitty sword
[5591.54s -> 5595.46s]  with 600 poison damage over fucking 12 seconds. And I want my friends to make fun of me because
[5595.46s -> 5614.68s]  I did that. When I got it, I got the six gems in that thing. Rattle, rattle, rattle. No one cares.
[5614.68s -> 5622.20s]  Yeah, they do. I think a lot of people care. I think a very large amount of people care.
[5628.81s -> 5640.06s]  Hey, and it's my stream. So I'm going to talk about Diablo 2 gems. OK, so
[5642.73s -> 5653.06s]  will he just be at the town? Dude, will you please read the nice comments? I'm a streamer.
[5653.06s -> 5656.42s]  I'm immune to those. I only read the ones that say like, hey, dude, like, when are you going to
[5656.42s -> 5669.93s]  put a baseball of your ass? God damn it. I had so much help there, too. All right. Cone size.
[5669.93s -> 5690.07s]  There it is. Finally. There's a lot. There's like two or three levels right here. Come on.
[5690.78s -> 5712.65s]  There we go. I leveled up twice. Range and crit. Yep. Damage and attack speed, probably. Yeah.
[5712.65s -> 5716.57s]  Banana ripeness chart. What do you like your banana? All right, hold on. I let me actually
[5716.57s -> 5720.33s]  get it like a decent run and then we'll go over the banana ripeness because it's very specific
[5720.33s -> 5725.30s]  for me because it depends on what you're doing with it. Is this is this going into a smoothie?
[5725.30s -> 5733.90s]  Are you eating this? Is this being put on cereal? It's very important that we go over that. I want
[5733.90s -> 5748.95s]  more defense and health. What keeps killing me every time? Crit damage. It barely hurt this guy.
[5749.59s -> 5786.10s]  We try to burn him. Oh, that was an unbelievable amount of damage. All right. So ripeness or a
[5786.10s -> 5794.14s]  smoothie. I want that shit right before it's rotten. I want an overripe banana to be a good
[5794.14s -> 5800.20s]  sweetener or a smoothie. How do you think about that? Yeah, I've got hold on. I've currently got
[5800.20s -> 5813.99s]  Tom Hanks voice. Let me hold on. If I want it really sweet, I would say like a little bit before
[5813.99s -> 5817.59s]  being overripe is the best place to put it in a smoothie. But sometimes you really want it to
[5817.59s -> 5824.47s]  have that really like sugary sugariness. That's disgusting. Whatever. You don't have to eat it,
[5825.03s -> 5830.52s]  but not okay. Is there peanut butter in it? If it's a peanut butter banana smoothie,
[5830.52s -> 5833.40s]  then I don't want the bananas to be very ripe because I don't want them to overpower the
[5833.40s -> 5836.52s]  peanut butter flavor. But then I don't want to use too much peanut butter because I don't actually
[5836.52s -> 5840.44s]  want to overpower the banana flavor with the peanut butter. It's a very, very, very hard
[5840.44s -> 5863.46s]  balance to get. I'm going all health. That was a really bad idea. I'll be all right. But all
[5863.46s -> 5869.06s]  seriously though. Yeah. I like a ripe banana for a smoothie. I like a non-ripe, just kind of right
[5869.06s -> 5875.69s]  in the middle. I'm just going to eat it. I do like bananas. I don't know what I just got, but I think
[5875.69s -> 5888.62s]  I can. Okay. I don't know what I'm, I don't know what's going on. Oh, it's like super speed. I just
[5888.62s -> 5895.78s]  can't kill anything. All right. Damage is a damage is immediate. I need it right now.
[5896.50s -> 5934.90s]  This guy's been walking around for 10 straight minutes. Shit. Shit. Cone size. All right. You
[5934.90s -> 5940.89s]  have to die. I have to get at least this one boss down, right? Or can I really say I'm a video game
[5940.89s -> 5948.07s]  player? There we go. Okay. I hope I'm not instantly dead, but I'm going to do arcane splinters because
[5948.07s -> 5963.06s]  we haven't seen it. What are your thoughts on Twitter being called X? I don't care. I use that
[5963.06s -> 5979.05s]  app like once a month. Uh, okay. What about this one here? I don't like the projectile size
[5979.05s -> 5994.82s]  reduction. I'll take it. All right. What does it do? They stay. Ooh, they, I think they, yeah,
[5994.82s -> 5998.98s]  they're still doing damage when they stay. All right. I don't want to lose this because
[5998.98s -> 6004.47s]  this has, I have an opportunity here to do pretty good. Let's regen a little. Don't get hurt.
[6005.03s -> 6012.28s]  Go get the other parchment. This is where it always goes to shit. I'd like the, okay. I'm dead.
[6014.36s -> 6021.74s]  Oh, that was fun. All right. I got the wellkeeper now. What does he do?
[6021.74s -> 6032.60s]  All right. What's up with you? Wellkeeper. You've earned my deepest gratitude for the rescue,
[6032.60s -> 6038.70s]  of course. And since we've made such a great team down there, I have a proposition for you.
[6038.70s -> 6046.18s]  Okay. I had a dream where you made fun of my chat message and literally made chat bully me.
[6052.20s -> 6057.72s]  Well, has dried up a long time ago. Now it leads to the very halls. You helped me escape.
[6057.72s -> 6061.64s]  Are you waiting to fall breakfast? Make sure you eat a full breakfast in the morning.
[6064.28s -> 6065.72s]  All right. I need to pay attention. What does this say?
[6070.57s -> 6074.74s]  This well has dried up long time ago. Now it leads to the very halls. You helped me escape.
[6074.74s -> 6083.43s]  But if you ever happened to find the other end, you might want to drop a trinket into the bucket.
[6083.43s -> 6099.30s]  Oh, whoa. I can just put these on. I have an entire stash of items that I just wasn't wearing.
[6099.30s -> 6114.09s]  Do I have to buy these? Wait, 10% health, free defense, 15% movement speed, 20% attack speed,
[6114.09s -> 6126.28s]  a shitload. Okay. Well, it says you own them. Attack speed, 10% more health and defense.
[6126.28s -> 6136.52s]  All right. This is really cool. Are there rarities? Are there uniques in this game?
[6136.52s -> 6157.62s]  Jeremy, your webcam is on and your balls are out. Whatever. I don't care. You have a ring too. Do I?
[6157.62s -> 6170.95s]  Oh, it's actually on the character too. Or am I making that up? I don't think I
[6170.95s -> 6175.37s]  got out with it. You can buy new items from the well keep it once you've retrieved them
[6175.37s -> 6182.26s]  through the well. So there's something down there where I can put items up there.
[6182.26s -> 6191.83s]  There are kids here. What are you doing? They really shouldn't be. It just shouldn't be.
[6191.83s -> 6208.47s]  It really shouldn't be at all. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to try to get a full run Haunted Caverns.
[6208.47s -> 6213.98s]  Adults only. I mean, you know, I've had the mature audience filter on this stream for like
[6213.98s -> 6222.78s]  eight years. I just never turned it off because I mean we talk about kind of weird shit on this
[6222.78s -> 6237.43s]  stream. All right. Right off the bat. Huge deal. It's not working clearly. It's not working.
[6237.43s -> 6248.15s]  It's not working. Bananas are adult content only. Yeah. You guys missed it. We just talked about.
[6248.15s -> 6264.12s]  We just talked about bananas for at least 10 straight minutes. Damage. Damage. Damage. Damage.
[6264.60s -> 6273.14s]  Damage. I it took me 10 minutes to get to 104 last time. I want to be doing 200 damage before
[6273.14s -> 6305.48s]  that first boss shows up. More. Here we go. This is the one. It actually might be because
[6306.20s -> 6312.17s]  I've leveled up like three times in 25 seconds. All right. Attack speed. We're going for damage
[6312.17s -> 6325.77s]  only. Already at 228 crits. Might as well just might as well just sign the paperwork now.
[6326.73s -> 6350.01s]  This is this was this is a done deal. Good. Look at that. Already got a cone with already. But wait
[6350.01s -> 6379.70s]  cone or crit? Which one? Cat ages in dog years. Cone omega lol. Everybody said cone. I was going
[6379.70s -> 6392.41s]  to pick cone too. So that's what I've decided. I'm getting a lot better at actually physically
[6392.41s -> 6403.80s]  clearing, which is what I really should be doing. 10 percent damage. Yep. I have to go. I got to go
[6403.80s -> 6412.41s]  for it. These guys take two hits and I try to get them down to take like one. I already took
[6412.41s -> 6428.20s]  damage. You might as well just fucking uninstall the fucking goddamn game. Dude, chill. I'm fine.
[6430.20s -> 6436.36s]  Range or health? Let's go. No, we're going damage. All right, let's get let's kill this guy quick.
[6436.36s -> 6457.82s]  Don't let him just walk around for 15 minutes. There's the well. You can tell he's mad. I'm
[6457.82s -> 6473.21s]  really not. I'm just messing around already. OK, already got the first item. Phantom needles. Let's
[6473.21s -> 6478.28s]  go. That's a good thing for May Lake because it just kind of randomly hits stuff around me.
[6488.76s -> 6498.76s]  Yeah. All right, give me an item so I can drop it in the well. When are you when are you going to
[6498.76s -> 6510.54s]  play POE on stream? I don't know. I don't think I might not. I mean, maybe me and stir would play
[6510.54s -> 6514.14s]  it just to mess around for like an afternoon or something. But that's an off stream game for me.
[6514.14s -> 6525.93s]  I mean, I mean, no, not necessarily. I mean, with the kind of direction that I was telling you guys
[6525.93s -> 6530.28s]  about with the channel and everything and more of these streams where I'm just kind of hanging
[6530.28s -> 6535.90s]  around, nothing too crazy going on, just chilling. Maybe I would just play POE and just do runs or
[6535.90s -> 6551.48s]  something. There it is. Is the cone size thing a joke or doesn't actually kind of doesn't feel
[6551.48s -> 6572.52s]  like it because I'm killing things a lot faster now. A slime rancher. No, you silly Billy. You
[6572.52s -> 6580.46s]  play more roadblocks. I think I'm trying to set up a MVM. I've got five people that are
[6581.26s -> 6586.92s]  willing to do MVM. I think that'd be really fun. Also, I want to open some crates too.
[6586.92s -> 6597.83s]  I just have a bunch of different cases from the last six or seven years just sitting in my backpack
[6597.83s -> 6606.39s]  and I just don't really know what to do with them. I don't want to do something like an egregious
[6606.39s -> 6625.54s]  amount, right? But I'll be like 20 open up like 10 to 25 cases or something. Open a case after
[6625.62s -> 6638.81s]  every death. That would get a little ridiculous, I think. Attack speed or crit or maybe pickup
[6638.81s -> 6657.50s]  range. Attack speed. Yeah, I was thinking movement speed, but it's just low. Six percent's not very
[6657.50s -> 6694.20s]  much. All right, I'm doing a lot better now. Decision time. That's big. This is also big.
[6694.92s -> 6708.42s]  They're all big. I really actually don't know. They're all good. Cone width or speed and damage.
[6708.42s -> 6730.74s]  Always damage. Yeah, that's true. First boss should be coming any second now. Did you get
[6730.74s -> 6737.42s]  the well guy? Yes. I don't have any items to put into the well though. So if I put items into the
[6737.42s -> 6744.09s]  well do they go away for this run? I feel like you just immediately deposit any item you find
[6744.09s -> 6762.01s]  regardless of if it's better. Yeah, defense and crit damage. I'm killing this guy so much faster
[6762.01s -> 6776.52s]  than the last like five attempts. Oh, that's the well. Okay, I just like walked into it.
[6777.32s -> 6808.30s]  Well, we might be depositing something right now. Oh, shit. What is it? Ooh. Ooh.
[6811.91s -> 6826.71s]  Critical strike damage by 40 percent. We're dropping that into the well. Uh-huh. What is
[6826.71s -> 6848.34s]  the thing in the top right? What is that? Is that the kind of attract thing? Cone size. That's my
[6848.34s -> 6853.43s]  health. That's a magnet. Should I make my way up there or should I get the... No, I'll get the
[6853.43s -> 6873.74s]  parchment first. I have to buy that item from the vendor. My pickup range is so bad. Let's get an
[6873.74s -> 6890.33s]  ability. I don't have one yet and it's been like eight minutes plus 10% additional attacks. Oh,
[6890.33s -> 6918.04s]  yeah. Double hits. Sing, bro. Bro, sing. I want everyone to just relax for a sec because I've got
[6918.04s -> 6924.54s]  something to tell you. We have officially confirmed, officially, that that hit sound,
[6925.88s -> 6932.68s]  the needles that are going out. Officially confirmed. That is the plants versus zombies
[6932.68s -> 6950.23s]  pellet hitting a zombie that has a bucket on their head. Sound effect. That has been officially not
[6950.23s -> 6978.76s]  confirmed by anybody but me. The projectiles are absolutely killer. It's killer. Damage again.
[6979.72s -> 7003.69s]  All right. I don't want to get... Hold on. There's so much EXP here. Damage. There's so much EXP. I
[7003.69s -> 7011.13s]  have to just leave it. I'll wrap around. Oh, my goodness. I think this is invulnerability.
[7011.93s -> 7036.18s]  Give me this. Shit. Shit. Are you an archer or kind of a barbarian kind of guy? I am more of a
[7036.18s -> 7061.77s]  ranged damage kind of fan but I do like melee characters. All right. I'm leaving. Another
[7061.77s -> 7079.77s]  centrist take. Add it to the list. Another centrist take from German985. Fucking Sag.
[7082.38s -> 7095.59s]  Ooh. Is that good? I don't know if that's even good on this character. I mean, I already pierced
[7095.59s -> 7104.01s]  with my weapon, right? Or does that work for the ability too? It's only for the ability. Ooh.
[7104.65s -> 7122.06s]  Maybe it is good. It is going through them now. Cool. What did this guy do to piss off so many
[7122.06s -> 7130.66s]  skeletons? You know, I thought about this the other day. Have we talked about this? The prospect of
[7131.62s -> 7136.58s]  the bandits. Look out, adventurer. Make sure to kill the bandits that are surrounding us.
[7137.38s -> 7142.58s]  There are like 70,000 fucking bandits in every video game and like 12 people that live in the
[7142.58s -> 7149.77s]  town. What's going on here? There are more bandits than people that live in any of these towns like
[7149.77s -> 7167.94s]  times a hundred. At some point, are they bandits or is that just the entire human population outside?
[7167.94s -> 7179.61s]  Oh, a pack of bandits. It's around our camp. It's me. You. That lady over there. In a healing well.
[7179.61s -> 7187.67s]  Adventurer, go out and stop the encroaching bandits. It's about as big as a small country's
[7187.67s -> 7197.61s]  worth of people out there. They definitely could have taken that over 100%. Like in D2, if they
[7197.61s -> 7205.85s]  just like rushed the rogue encampment, we're all dead. They just they've never tried. Do you wear
[7205.85s -> 7241.91s]  a wig? No. Yeah, there's a lot of skeletons too. A lot of demons. I think this is an automatic. I
[7241.91s -> 7252.30s]  mean, but this one's good too, though. 10% damage and 10% attack speed is you can't pick anything
[7252.30s -> 7271.42s]  else if it's here. You just can't. All right. I think a boss is incoming here. Yep. Remember this
[7271.42s -> 7291.43s]  part. Not so tough now, are you? Speed. All right. I don't get cocky because this is the furthest I've
[7291.43s -> 7315.72s]  ever gotten. Geez. Lightning strike here. Maybe orbs. I have piercing. I don't think this is. I
[7315.72s -> 7331.90s]  should do the blades if I have piercing, right? Always orb. Really? Even with piercing. I'm going
[7331.90s -> 7348.34s]  with blades. I think the piercing is going to be good. I need to pick up this shit so bad.
[7348.98s -> 7377.88s]  There's so much on the ground. Let me pull everybody over here. OK, health and defense. Whoa.
[7379.40s -> 7392.01s]  I'm fine. I need that thing. That thing that sucks everything to me. I would level up like five times.
[7392.57s -> 7415.91s]  God damn it. Come on. I was really, really stupid, but I got a bunch of experience. Additional
[7415.91s -> 7430.82s]  attacks or health. I had to do it. Point one additional attacks or the movement speed
[7430.82s -> 7438.34s]  or health. What the fuck is he doing? I had to go through there because I had to get the item.
[7439.93s -> 7446.15s]  Bro, this is boring. Play Persona 4. You're not going to start an account where every day you're
[7446.15s -> 7450.79s]  going to say, hey, please, Jerma, please. This is day 50 of Persona 4. Let me help you again.
[7450.79s -> 7463.05s]  I probably won't play that ever. So don't make one of those. Persona 4 is good. I know. I'm going
[7463.05s -> 7472.94s]  with the health. It might be stupid, but I don't care. I want to live. Did I tell you guys that I
[7472.94s -> 7478.70s]  it was like, oh, man, Persona. Persona is such an awesome series. Just try it. And I like I don't
[7478.70s -> 7483.98s]  know. I downloaded one of them. It was like Persona 5, but not the actual fucking Persona 5 video game,
[7483.98s -> 7490.22s]  I guess. It was like, hey, this is like not Persona 5, but it's like Persona 5, but it's not that game.
[7490.22s -> 7523.14s]  I don't know what I did. Additional attacks. You need to focus. Yes, I do. Thank you. There it is.
[7524.15s -> 7573.78s]  Yay. There's so much over here. I got it. Low 30 damage. Go on. Let me kill the second boss.
[7578.49s -> 7593.02s]  I got him. Block strength, health or probably this one, right? And then deposit this immediately.
[7594.71s -> 7604.30s]  Go get the magnet now. I don't have any helmets. He's a terrible. I mean, I don't have any helmets
[7604.30s -> 7613.78s]  though, do I? Defense, block strength. Yeah, I'm going with health. I already have this one.
[7614.02s -> 7624.42s]  A magnet just dropped nearby. Really? Oh my goodness. It did. You're right. You're right.
[7624.42s -> 7635.98s]  Let me go get it. You can only use the well once per run. Oh, all right. Well, let's level up like
[7635.98s -> 7657.38s]  15 times more cone size, uh, attack speed, uh, piercing and okay. This is a way. There's a,
[7657.38s -> 7664.50s]  there's a lot of shit up here. Hold on. Okay. All right. All right. Now I'm going to give me
[7664.50s -> 7682.22s]  the scroll. Oh shit. It's getting hairy. I'm about, I'm hitting the limit here of my character's
[7682.22s -> 7707.56s]  strength versus the difficulty of the level. I have a lot of money though. Get the scroll.
[7707.56s -> 7715.34s]  I know I'm going, I'm going. Look at all that XP. I'm going to make my way back up to get it all.
[7715.34s -> 7734.86s]  I'm going to sneeze. I think I apologize in advance. I cannot hit the mute button because
[7734.86s -> 7737.93s]  well, actually I could pause it, but I don't want to lose the rhythm.
[7737.93s -> 7764.06s]  Oh, well, geez, there it is. 5,000 in one run. Just do it already. Come on. Damage.
[7766.47s -> 7776.30s]  Ooh. I maxed out the strength thing. This would be great if I, if I could win right now,
[7776.30s -> 7785.82s]  that'd be awesome. Oh, you're a guardian of the parchment. I can get two of these.
[7787.53s -> 7793.72s]  Well, might as well get all three of them. I get the orbs. Oh, this is the end. Yep. Maybe not.
[7794.44s -> 7816.12s]  Jesus. Oh, that's yeah. I don't think so. I don't think so, but I'll try.
[7826.41s -> 7852.09s]  It's not too bad. I had to tank it for that money. 6K. Can I get to 10K?
[7857.35s -> 7879.19s]  Give me the pickup range because I'm definitely going to die soon. Hey, how's the bit rate over
[7879.19s -> 7884.47s]  there in a streamer video on demand land? How was it over there guys? How do you feel? How's it going?
[7884.47s -> 7917.46s]  It's pretty good. Really? No, no, no. That's it. Let me get one more level. Nice. Okay. Phantom
[7917.46s -> 7925.88s]  Rift again. Yeah. Wait, what did that do? Oh, I can't have two. I don't know what I just did.
[7925.88s -> 7933.98s]  Why do you hate Persona 4? I don't. It's a really fun game. I just feel like that game takes a long
[7933.98s -> 7944.14s]  time to play. Correct choice, but read it next time. Oh, it adds one projectile. Okay, cool.
[7944.14s -> 7947.90s]  I'm just going with health and defense now to try to live because I'm actually might be able to do
[7947.90s -> 7990.87s]  it. Maybe not. Weird pattern. Okay. Health, right? That's ridiculous. I'm just going to try to get the
[7993.11s -> 8014.86s]  magnet thing. If I get health along the way, that's great. No, no, no, no, no. This is bad.
[8015.90s -> 8040.52s]  I got a turkey though. That's okay. Come on. Give me another level so I can get health. Health? Shit.
[8040.52s -> 8055.54s]  Movement speed. Is there going to be health in here? Good. I only got eight minutes left
[8055.54s -> 8070.90s]  and that's a full run done. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Bad. Oh,
[8070.90s -> 8094.63s]  boy. Oh, boy. Oh, I made a lot of, look at all this. I unlocked a lot of stuff. I unlocked an
[8094.63s -> 8112.39s]  upgrade. Necromancer. Cool. I got to do blessing for. Oh, I'm unlocking things to upgrade.
[8112.39s -> 8123.14s]  Interesting. Wait, didn't I have 6,000 gold? Didn't I have 6,000? Where's this 3,000 come from?
[8124.68s -> 8150.42s]  That was kills though. 2,500 gold? What? That's my entire bank account. I think I'm going to get
[8150.42s -> 8160.86s]  the pickup range. That's pretty good. Completed quest, increase XP gain. I'll try ranged.
[8160.86s -> 8171.82s]  Attention streamer, please play Pikmin 4. Um, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe one day. What's the
[8171.82s -> 8180.46s]  goal now? What am I trying to do? Defeat the lich. That's probably the last boss that I just saw.
[8181.88s -> 8199.62s]  Uh, deal 750,000 damage. This is not in one run, so just total. Kill 50,000 slimes. All right,
[8199.62s -> 8213.51s]  so we need to do astronomer's orb. All right, I want to do astronomer's orb. Let's do it. Okay,
[8213.51s -> 8224.25s]  cool. Ever considered disco, uh, elcium? I've considered it, but I have not played it. All right,
[8224.25s -> 8235.72s]  where's the strength? Did I unlock one of these damage? All right, that's a big deal. That's a
[8235.72s -> 8251.34s]  big deal. 10%, 20%. Wait, let me get rid of some of the... I'm not getting diminishing returns for
[8251.34s -> 8259.26s]  this, right? Just like vampire sparrers, because give me the 20% damage. Give me the 20% damage in
[8259.26s -> 8279.18s]  the health regen. This is going to be fun. Let me take a sip. Max out health regen. That's a good
[8279.18s -> 8294.17s]  idea. Actually a good idea. Maybe I'll do that now. Oh, that's some good cider. I came pretty
[8294.17s -> 8298.17s]  close with the melee character. Let's see if I can do it with the ranged character, especially
[8298.17s -> 8303.13s]  with that 20% damage. Look at that. I'm killing skeletons in one hit. That wasn't happening
[8303.13s -> 8310.31s]  before. Well is right here. Already level one. Health regen. Let's go. Let's do it.
[8310.31s -> 8334.65s]  Look at this piercing damage. Attack speed already. Good start. Get the scrolls early, man. Yeah,
[8334.65s -> 8347.70s]  that's a good call. That's a good call. I'm gonna go get it right now. You always should be making
[8347.70s -> 8356.60s]  your way down that way in the first minute or so, right? What are your theories of the lore of the
[8356.60s -> 8363.54s]  game? I don't know. There's just a lot of dead people. These skeletons were once a person.
[8364.18s -> 8386.12s]  That was 9% movement speed. It's worth it. Probably more than one person died. Yeah,
[8386.92s -> 8427.77s]  probably. I need to wash my eyes. You need to wash your eyes. It's apparently estimated that
[8427.77s -> 8435.11s]  about 117 billion people have ever been born. So is that why they're all outside the Rogan
[8435.11s -> 8464.09s]  cabin? Yep. Shit, I didn't want to knock that over. I want to leave those. Get an item right now.
[8464.09s -> 8487.16s]  Oh, I've got 20% more damage to close enemies. You know that more than one person has been born
[8487.16s -> 8500.90s]  today. It's kind of wild. All right. I said orbs, but there's no orbs here. So we're gonna have to
[8500.90s -> 8511.02s]  go with the needles. I feel like I've written something down that I really wanted to go over
[8511.02s -> 8530.38s]  today. I forget what it was. I was like, I have to talk about this someday. What was it? Okay.
[8530.38s -> 8539.75s]  All right. All right. So you know, like the fart sound effects sounds, you know, we all know the
[8539.75s -> 8549.61s]  ones like that. A fart sound effect. Don't you think it's kind of ridiculous that those may
[8549.61s -> 8557.35s]  have been recorded like 20 or 30 years ago? Somebody farted into a mic and it's been used
[8557.35s -> 8564.92s]  for 30 fucking years. Imagine being that guy or being that guy's kids. And it's like, yeah,
[8564.92s -> 8572.39s]  that's that's me up there. I'm I farted into a mic 25 years ago and it's just it's everywhere.
[8572.95s -> 8584.49s]  How would you feel about that? Imagine like you're just like watching a movie or something and you
[8584.49s -> 8592.62s]  hear your fart. You farted. Is it embarrassing or is it like, yep, I get a lot of those residuals
[8592.62s -> 8599.80s]  for the fart sounds I did. Yeah, I recorded 20 of them and they're all used and they use the same
[8599.80s -> 8609.43s]  ones from like the same library for the last 30 years. But how does how does that guy feel
[8609.51s -> 8629.11s]  now that he's like 60? I don't know. That's a lot of damage. A thousand people just left.
[8630.33s -> 8654.44s]  They're obviously not strong enough. Fart royalties. Yeah, that me and Holly were
[8654.44s -> 8660.78s]  just sitting there and it's just like, yeah, like we just heard that fart sound. That guy
[8660.78s -> 8667.98s]  did somebody had to have done that. You think that somebody I saw somebody say that they
[8667.98s -> 8672.70s]  think it was a mouth somebody could do. I don't think so. Some of those are very, very real.
[8681.64s -> 8687.10s]  I don't know why I just picture and I don't know. You can think I'm looking stupid for this. I just
[8687.50s -> 8692.95s]  see some guy just like, hey, yeah, Bill, we need like we need a fart sound. I guess
[8693.59s -> 8696.87s]  I'm just imagining the guy taking this and it's like a standard microphone,
[8696.87s -> 8701.91s]  the type of microphone that it's got a long cable connected long. It's about at least 10 to 15 feet
[8701.91s -> 8707.64s]  long and it's plugged in somewhere and it's got that metal top like a stand up routine.
[8707.64s -> 8711.91s]  And the guy just puts it like right between his cheeks and just parts right into it.
[8711.91s -> 8719.34s]  These things, he like presses it up there. That's what I see. 18 plus stream. It's been there for
[8719.34s -> 8726.87s]  seven or eight years. Okay. That warning has been here for no way. Get the kids out of here.
[8726.87s -> 8729.83s]  Get the kids out of here. They never should have been here. They shouldn't be here. Get the kids
[8729.83s -> 8757.38s]  out of here. Kids. This is no longer a kid friendly discussion. Your viewers are increasing. Carry on.
[8762.89s -> 8773.54s]  I'll take that. And don't you think that the audio engineer after bill like
[8773.54s -> 8778.26s]  put the mic right up to where his ass is and did it and it ripped it. It was just awful.
[8778.34s -> 8782.66s]  Do you think he's like, Hey Bill, that was fucking rancid. We should do another one,
[8782.66s -> 8786.42s]  but this time don't put the microphone like up to your asshole. You should probably do it
[8786.42s -> 8796.97s]  a little further away because that was fucking disgusting. I imagine just having two headphones
[8796.97s -> 8800.73s]  on just sitting there and it's like, yeah, I don't know if we can, I don't think we should
[8800.73s -> 8817.62s]  put that one in. You know what I'm talking about though. All you, all that matters is at least 10
[8817.62s -> 8822.74s]  of you get it. You know what I mean? There's like, there's like 13, 14,000 people here right now.
[8822.74s -> 8826.92s]  As long as 10 of you understand what I mean by this and like, you get it, then I'm good.
[8826.92s -> 8840.34s]  Then we're good. I'm okay with getting the question marks from like 10 plus thousand people. As long
[8840.34s -> 8846.98s]  as I know, like six of you are like, yup, I see it. I know what he's, I know what's going on here.
[8846.98s -> 8863.59s]  I get it. Lower the bar. Yeah. Well, that's how I make myself feel better, right? I don't care what
[8863.59s -> 8869.35s]  the 14,000 people said. I care about what five of you have to say. The five of you that I made up
[8869.35s -> 8873.83s]  that agree with everything I ever say. And there's nobody ever disagrees. And it's the five of you.
[8874.79s -> 8878.79s]  I have Avengers in this chat right now and you think it's you, you know what I mean?
[8878.79s -> 8887.03s]  Just sitting there like, yeah, it's me. I'm the one. It's probably a lot. How many of you just did
[8887.03s -> 8922.81s]  that? Oh, let's talk about TF2 cases. I'm curious. So they did a thing where damage, yup. What's the
[8922.81s -> 8940.60s]  next among us stream? Uh, it was a one night only. Okay. So cases in TF2. I remember the last time I
[8940.60s -> 8948.52s]  really played, it was you opened up weapons cases, but those are no longer a thing. It's now paint
[8948.52s -> 8957.54s]  cases that you can put on most anything. And the paint has quality. Is that, that's what's,
[8957.54s -> 8969.11s]  that's what's going on, right? Uh, or so this, yeah, there's cosmetic cases and then there's
[8969.11s -> 8975.56s]  the paint cases and the paint cases are the old weapons cases, but the paint can now go on most
[8976.36s -> 8986.92s]  main, um, like number one in your loadout. So what is considered a really rare case or a really good
[8986.92s -> 8997.56s]  case? That sounds kind of good. When you do not use your main attack for two seconds, your abilities
[8997.56s -> 9011.90s]  become stronger over time up to winter, winter 2017. I'm not sure which one of these to take.
[9012.46s -> 9027.99s]  I feel like this, the range character really needs to shoot the bow. 30 or 40 is pretty special.
[9033.51s -> 9040.79s]  Yeah. Holly just reminded me. So let's just take a, let's take a little bit of break and go over
[9040.79s -> 9045.26s]  this because you got, some of you guys are going to really, really, you're going to like this one.
[9045.26s -> 9049.10s]  Okay. Take the ring. All right. Well, take the ring. But I let, while I have a second to give you a
[9049.10s -> 9055.06s]  quick little story, if you had any indication at all of what kind of player is playing the game
[9055.06s -> 9062.52s]  of team fortress. So in spawn, when you see that flog pyro in spawn and it's like, what the
[9062.52s -> 9070.10s]  fuck is that guy doing? It might be AFK. I, uh, got really high and just ate like almost a whole
[9070.10s -> 9076.57s]  bag of chocolates and AFK'd in the spawn as a flog pyro for an entire round. If you're wondering
[9076.57s -> 9084.10s]  who is behind the flog pyro, that's, that's what we do. That's what we do. And it, it got me thinking
[9084.10s -> 9092.52s]  about, holy shit. I just, I just did that. I lost that match because of you. Yeah. I just,
[9092.52s -> 9100.71s]  I had the flog out and I was just sitting there just eating chocolate. And I was sitting there
[9100.71s -> 9105.03s]  going, ah, I haven't really done anything this round. I think I walked out of the spawn and died
[9105.03s -> 9110.57s]  once. And I think I fell asleep too. I think I fell asleep and woke up at the second round.
[9113.40s -> 9124.04s]  So that, if you're curious, that you're, you're right. You're correct. I am that flog pyro. I just
[9124.04s -> 9134.31s]  wanted to make sure you were aware. It really happened that I, all right. Which one of these
[9134.31s -> 9148.34s]  am I taking? Bro, you're like 45. Not quite. Not quite. Take the ring. TF2's greatest soldiers.
[9148.34s -> 9155.88s]  Thank you. Yeah. And then I walk out of spawn and I get the, the, the, the flog up the, with the,
[9155.88s -> 9163.91s]  the meter, whatever it's called. And then sniper. It's like, dude, you, you, he's way too far away
[9163.91s -> 9168.84s]  and just holding down the crit fire. You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it.
[9168.92s -> 9176.44s]  Flog pyros, listen to me. I'm telling you, we have to be better. We have to be better. I know
[9176.44s -> 9202.98s]  we can be. Okay. I'll take the, uh, I'll take the ring. I really did just eat chocolate for
[9202.98s -> 9211.37s]  the whole round. It was fucked. Don't ever use a Liberty launcher again. Hey, I'm going to use
[9211.37s -> 9227.37s]  whatever item I feel like using. This one's really good too though. Well, they were little chocolates.
[9227.37s -> 9232.49s]  They were the little tiny ones. So I, realistically, I probably ate like a bar and a half of chocolate.
[9233.03s -> 9239.14s]  It was just the little, the little Hershey's mini ones, which you're never ready to eat.
[9239.14s -> 9244.02s]  Just one of those. I might as well just buy the Hershey's bars, the full bars,
[9244.02s -> 9247.62s]  because I always eat a full bar worth of them. Anyways, what's the point of getting the little
[9247.62s -> 9263.22s]  ones? I think 10% tax. What about Hershey kisses? Hershey kisses are good. And I know I look,
[9264.26s -> 9271.30s]  dude. Hey, wait a minute. Hershey's tastes like puke. Hershey's tastes like somebody puked in your
[9271.30s -> 9280.89s]  face. Yeah. It's, I still don't, I like it. Yeah. And if you smell the inside of a bag of M&M's
[9280.89s -> 9284.41s]  after there's no M&M's in it, it smells like somebody's shit in your bathroom an hour ago.
[9284.41s -> 9307.24s]  We all know this. Uh, it's this one. It's always the damage. Uh, I need to go deposit this ring
[9307.24s -> 9337.56s]  because it's really good. German. Nobody knows this. Try it next time. 10% movement speed. Yeah.
[9338.20s -> 9350.47s]  Need to get to that well. Hershey's is a terrible chocolate. Yeah, but it's hard to beat taking a
[9350.47s -> 9357.83s]  graham cracker, having a graham. I've taken a nice warm marshmallow, squishing it with the two or
[9357.83s -> 9364.60s]  three blocks of Hershey's and making a little more. It's just, it hits so different. I don't
[9364.60s -> 9369.08s]  care how gross you think Hershey's is. That hits differently. It just does. It's very, very good.
[9370.04s -> 9381.22s]  However many fit. It's sometimes it's too, too little squares. Whatever fits on the graham cracker.
[9381.86s -> 9386.10s]  After you eat European chocolate, you'll never want American chocolate ever again.
[9386.10s -> 9392.58s]  I trust me. I've had a lot of chocolate. I've had it from all over the world. I've had chocolate.
[9392.58s -> 9400.79s]  I've had tons of it, but okay. I've had a lot of like Kraft cheeseburgers and like I've had like
[9400.79s -> 9403.43s]  a bunch of stakes before. That doesn't mean I'm never going to eat McDonald's ever again.
[9404.07s -> 9407.42s]  Sometimes it's just you, you're looking for a different,
[9408.38s -> 9413.94s]  you're looking for a different feel today. A McDonald's cheeseburger is arguably not even
[9413.94s -> 9420.34s]  remotely close, not even close to a burger you'd get at a nice restaurant, but I'm still going to
[9420.34s -> 9433.42s]  get it sometimes. Should I just go full movement speed piercing? Yeah. All right. Where's the well?
[9435.13s -> 9448.33s]  All right. I'm at the 10 minute mark. Where's the boss? I need more attack speed.
[9448.89s -> 9468.90s]  Grandpa's on the food podcast rant again. I'm telling you, do not be surprised. Don't be
[9468.90s -> 9476.74s]  surprised. I'm just saying don't be surprised if when I am retired, there is a food podcast.
[9476.74s -> 9481.86s]  That's like once every few weeks. Don't be surprised. I'm just, I'm telling you what is
[9481.86s -> 9504.71s]  probably happening. Do not be surprised. This one hopes are skyrocketing for the food podcast.
[9512.33s -> 9519.03s]  You better call it food mode enabled. How one gamer saw his love for food turn into a second
[9519.03s -> 9531.66s]  hobby. By the way, we don't talk about food at all on this podcast at all. It's an, and when it's
[9531.66s -> 9543.59s]  getting, when it gets brought up, I get annoyed at the guest. Oh my God. That's a lot. This actually
[9543.59s -> 9567.94s]  could be the one. So I'm going to pay attention now. So let's put the gamer trying hands on damage.
[9582.10s -> 9585.54s]  Let me pause it for one second. Somebody has an explanation. There's a reason American chocolate
[9585.54s -> 9589.46s]  has that flavor because back in the early days of Hershey's when transporting the milk got timed
[9589.46s -> 9622.52s]  out. Nevermind. Uh, I'm not doing so well. I need more health. Yeah, I have to take it and then
[9622.52s -> 9642.12s]  hopefully you drop an item. Come on, come on, come on. You did lightning strike. I like splinters.
[9643.06s -> 9663.74s]  They seems like pretty good. I like the area denial movement speed again. You might think
[9663.74s -> 9683.19s]  that that's not a smart play, but in about one to two minutes it will be. All right. Uh,
[9684.31s -> 9693.22s]  this is the one I want to deposit. That kind of nerves me a lot right now though. So I probably
[9693.22s -> 9705.66s]  won't beat it. Who's he talking to? My grandma though. She's right here. Hey, thanks. Thanks
[9705.66s -> 9728.82s]  grandma. The fuck do you think I was talking to? Damn. That's a lot. Let's try to collect as many
[9728.82s -> 9746.87s]  things as possible. Speed or damage? Yeah. Damn it. I need more attack speed. If I see it,
[9746.87s -> 9758.65s]  I have to grab it. It doesn't matter what the other options are. What is that? Anybody know what that
[9758.65s -> 9797.69s]  is? 100% damage. Nice. Okay. I want the health and the movement speed. Whoa, there's a lot of shit
[9797.69s -> 9829.24s]  over here. Big damage. 8% duration projectiles. Yep. I think I got most of it. Nice. More projectiles.
[9829.24s -> 9842.70s]  I got three arrows now. That's awesome. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Damage.
[9845.18s -> 9888.06s]  Where's the boss? Here. Kill. Kill. Kill. Okay. I don't have any of these. When you do not use
[9888.06s -> 9895.70s]  your main attack for two seconds, your abilities become stronger. All right. Plus 0.07% damage for
[9895.70s -> 9918.65s]  each missing health point. So 0.07 times 589. What is that? 10% crit? That's not very much.
[9918.65s -> 9931.66s]  Like 14% right now. I mean, I guess it's okay. I'll do it. I'll try it. I'm doing more damage
[9931.66s -> 9939.35s]  right now. So I shouldn't want to get any more health. Oh, that's doing actually a lot. That's
[9939.35s -> 9947.46s]  a lot more than I thought it was going to be. Attack speed. Where's the boss? All right. Killed
[9947.46s -> 9955.32s]  it. Oops. All right. This actually might be the one as long as I can actually do it.
[9956.34s -> 9979.35s]  Not talk about it because I am actually mowing down monsters right now. Attack speed is really
[9979.35s -> 10023.53s]  killing me though. I need it. Damn it. That's probably just the orb. Cheese. Two hits to the
[10023.53s -> 10040.65s]  shields. All right. Now I'm going up to pick up this thing and I'm going to collect everything.
[10040.65s -> 10049.56s]  I just, you know what I'm saying? Carrot only three health. What's the point of even picking
[10049.56s -> 10087.83s]  it up? That was three health. There it is. Finally get to five health for max damage. Yeah. But
[10087.83s -> 10097.34s]  five health means I'm dead. Didn't one hit. If I'm careful, I could probably do it. There's one more
[10097.34s -> 10104.57s]  boss. All right. This is where it gets really, really bad, but I should be fine. Carve a path
[10104.57s -> 10126.14s]  out. That's all it is. Forget about any of the items. I'll get them all with the magnet. Okay.
[10126.14s -> 10129.58s]  Shit. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm
[10129.58s -> 10162.92s]  fine. Piercing. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Just give me it. It's right here.
[10162.92s -> 10168.87s]  I'm getting so much health. I need this. I'll level up like three times if I pick this up.
[10168.87s -> 10190.33s]  Let's go. Okay. More attack speed. Now we walk all the way back down here.
[10190.33s -> 10237.70s]  Damage. Damage. Duration. I don't know. It could be bebecrit damage. All right. This is it. Attack
[10237.70s -> 10250.90s]  speed is priority if I find it and just try to stay alive. Nice. Electrified orbs. Orbs deal
[10250.90s -> 10260.66s]  additional lightning damage based on their movement speed. What's my movement speed right now? I mean,
[10260.66s -> 10273.69s]  that sounds kind of amazing. My movement speed is pretty high. All right. There's another magnet
[10273.69s -> 10330.41s]  down here. Get down there. Jesus. Okay. 50% crit damage. I can't go anywhere. Don't freak out.
[10331.05s -> 10336.50s]  Don't freak out. Just get out of here. Just get out. Get out of this stupid thing I'm in.
[10337.06s -> 10396.02s]  Then I'm going to I'm going to heal. Nice. Nice. Attack speed. I need it. I'm going to stay over
[10396.02s -> 10420.76s]  here because yeah, this is where it gets. There's the boss. Play it smart. Oh, there's too many.
[10455.35s -> 10467.82s]  Shit. Oh, I was so close. Damn it. Spawning behind me. That sucked. I got a lot of stuff,
[10467.82s -> 10491.22s]  though. Ability expert. Elven slippers. Arcane splitter. My next main quest. Cool. All right.
[10491.22s -> 10520.47s]  How much does it cost for this? Okay. No, never mind. That's that's ludicrous. Equip the ring.
[10520.47s -> 10532.22s]  Ah, pick up range or attack speed. I think I need more defense. Should I keep watching or should I
[10532.22s -> 10539.64s]  go shit? I'll be back. I'll be here when you get back. Or maybe you do something else today.
[10539.64s -> 10551.27s]  Attack speed. Kind of feels mandatory, doesn't it? And the health. Do I need a shield for block
[10551.27s -> 10591.53s]  strength? How does that work? Can do defense or pick up range. No, I want movement speed is so
[10591.53s -> 10607.75s]  important. Let me refund to all. I got 11,000. What do I damage? 30% more damage. 18% more attack
[10607.75s -> 10629.78s]  speed and movement speed and pick up range. And I got my items on. So what's the next quest?
[10629.78s -> 10635.69s]  I haven't been here in a while. What's this place? Okay. Kill 15,000 enemies in one visit.
[10635.69s -> 10646.81s]  Kill 50,000 imps. Defeat the flame dancer. Survive the ember grounds until there are 12 minutes left.
[10646.81s -> 10655.74s]  I can do that. Kill a thousand enemies in one visit. I can do that right now. Let's do it right
[10655.74s -> 10665.86s]  now. It's 12 minutes. That's it. Wait, that's actually kind of a long time. I'll try. We have
[10665.86s -> 10672.58s]  a stretch break. Um, yeah, it's been like three hours. I'm going to go get some water. I'll be
[10672.58s -> 10687.74s]  right back. Hey guys, I just stood up to go get some water and there are orcs outside of my room.
[10687.74s -> 10947.91s]  That's the orcs are coming music. Be right back. How is the uh, how's the fight against all the
[10947.91s -> 10969.14s]  orcs going in my absence? We are losing. Uh oh. Let me get in here. Hey, let me get in here and
[10969.14s -> 10977.02s]  get this all sorted out for you. All right. What I just have to live until there's 12 minutes left.
[10977.02s -> 10982.57s]  All right. I got it more. Look at I'm already doing a ton of damage. There's that progression
[10982.57s -> 11016.39s]  system. Speed. Speed again if it's there. Crits. I'm building attack speed first as fast as I can
[11016.39s -> 11021.02s]  so I don't have to worry about it later because I kind of got all caught up before
[11021.02s -> 11050.06s]  because I didn't have, I wasn't doing enough dps. All right. Range. Pick up range. We're going with
[11050.06s -> 11067.96s]  a utility build. We're going to go with some utility. Wow. That's great to get right now.
[11087.50s -> 11094.17s]  Sometimes I do block. I'm curious how that system works. Is it just straight up a percent to block?
[11094.17s -> 11128.55s]  Chance. Get more defense. Read the thing. Kind of good but damage. Don't listen to that person.
[11128.55s -> 11131.67s]  Ban them. I don't even know who you're referring to. There's a lot of people here.
[11131.75s -> 11143.94s]  Hey ban that. Ban that guy in chat. Don't listen to them. I've actually been at like a stadium
[11143.94s -> 11152.57s]  and I just hear from like row eight. Seat number like fucking 400. You're going to ban that guy.
[11153.13s -> 11158.92s]  Ban that guy. Ban him. He's a piece of shit. And I'm just looking. I don't know who. Who?
[11158.92s -> 11162.52s]  He's like that guy. That guy right there. That guy. He's pointing. It's like dude there's like
[11162.52s -> 11169.69s]  600 people where you're pointing. I don't know that this one. This guy here. No you fucking idiot.
[11169.69s -> 11193.91s]  No you're so stupid. You're way off. This guy. This guy right here. No. Ban that. Ban that guy.
[11200.79s -> 11210.90s]  Always attack speed. Am I at the cap? Why do I feel like I'm at the attack speed cap? It feels
[11210.90s -> 11248.98s]  like it. Is there a cap? I don't think there would be. Damage again. I gotta get this to 200
[11248.98s -> 11267.77s]  really quickly. More crit chance. Crit damage is great but you actually have to be critting.
[11267.77s -> 11277.34s]  So let's get that situated first. Now we can get it. I mean we. Why do you keep saying we? I don't
[11277.34s -> 11311.56s]  know. How close am I to? No not even close. Never mind. Wells right here. If he dropped something
[11311.56s -> 11328.10s]  good. Get these little shell fucking things out of here. God that just took half my health.
[11328.10s -> 11366.10s]  Okay it's not an item but it's archment. I'm already almost dead. Oh thank god it's saving us. Okay
[11366.10s -> 11379.18s]  now slow it down and get some health. I can't even get in there. That little shit has like a thousand
[11379.18s -> 11398.17s]  health. All right. Uh splinters. Attack speed. Am I at a cap? I feel like I'm not swinging faster
[11398.17s -> 11425.91s]  for the last like three times I've done this. You are? No cap. No cap. No cap. Are you sure? 1.8.
[11425.91s -> 11445.42s]  No cap. No cap. Um I guess there is no cap. I feel like I haven't seen a 20% increase. I'm
[11445.42s -> 11475.43s]  gonna piss people off for that. There it is. 25% critical damage main weapon and then a 10% cone
[11475.43s -> 11517.40s]  with with the main weapon. Okay collect the part that sucks. I haven't seen this guy before. Oh
[11517.40s -> 11532.17s]  no wait we have. Very briefly. Oh yeah I remember this. It is this guy. And goodbye. I got further
[11532.17s -> 11545.72s]  than I did before. That was hard. I did that at least. Character exterminator. I unlocked a new
[11545.72s -> 11574.12s]  character. It's the exterminator. Cool. It's a ranged character. Movement speed. Attack speed.
[11574.12s -> 11584.79s]  Yeah I'll keep other. I'll keep the rest of this one. This is the worst character. Um let's find out.
[11584.79s -> 11602.73s]  I got one of these done. Beat the lich. One run. Geez. All right I'm gonna try to get to the end.
[11602.73s -> 11629.98s]  Haunted caverns. It's a flamethrower guy. What do we do? Attack speed. I'm imagining it's probably
[11629.98s -> 11655.75s]  just spray. All attack speed. Don't touch that. Not yet. Seems kind of fun. Blog gaming. Oh yeah.
[11660.14s -> 11688.23s]  Where are my chocolates? The auto attack is funny because it just holds the button down.
[11688.23s -> 11704.14s]  Useful whatever. Getting some kind of shit rolls here. Should I turn on auto aim too? Yeah. All
[11704.14s -> 11723.43s]  right I'm playing just with I'm playing with my left hand. 10% burn chance. I guess that's good.
[11723.43s -> 11738.06s]  Attack speed and burn chance. This doesn't do very much damage but I guess it stacks. This sounds
[11738.06s -> 11743.58s]  like shaking a bunch of colored pencils. It that might even be more accurate than the lego comment.
[11744.71s -> 11751.74s]  Yeah it's grabbing a bunch and I mean at least 30 colored pencils and when you do that you get a you
[11751.74s -> 11758.58s]  pick up as many as you can and then like six or seven drop on the ground. Yep oh I know. Speed.
[11762.38s -> 11786.94s]  Follow the blood. I was gonna say who is that my blood? Whose blood is this? Uh what is that?
[11787.58s -> 11804.97s]  Uh oh. 100? 100 what? What does that mean? 199. Why is it counting down? Don't leave the area.
[11804.97s -> 11816.04s]  Kill 99 things inside of it. This character. Probably lightning strike because I don't have
[11816.04s -> 11824.15s]  to do anything. It just does it automatically. I'm gonna do lightning strike. So kill things inside
[11824.15s -> 11862.28s]  of here okay. That hurt a lot. Definitely more range. All right three two one zero. What is that?
[11862.92s -> 11877.74s]  Was that a super item? Like a piece of something? Okay I actually want to aim now because it's
[11877.74s -> 11903.42s]  aiming erratically in random directions. Oh shit. You know I have area. Rejectile area
[11904.14s -> 11924.42s]  is I think what you need to put on with this guy. All right follow the blood back but don't die.
[11943.05s -> 11969.42s]  10% is not very much when it's 28. Like one or two damage. Oh wait where's the blood? I forgot
[11969.42s -> 12000.41s]  about the blood trail. Where'd it go? Where's that blood trail? There it is. Okay now give me
[12000.41s -> 12014.18s]  something else. I kind of like this character. Am I going to keep saying that in another five
[12014.18s -> 12039.19s]  minutes when I can't hurt anything? Probably not. I know. Yes safe safe. I'm trying to be safe.
[12039.19s -> 12050.89s]  Safe Andy. That's me. I want help. I could. That scared me a lot. I just did not expect
[12050.89s -> 12058.33s]  it to be there right there. Sorry I know I'm like kind of chilled out tonight and that was a very
[12058.33s -> 12081.64s]  loud sound. I do apologize. It's actually kind of good against bosses though. What do we got?
[12081.64s -> 12090.98s]  Base crit, defense and block, spike boots. When hit drop 10 spikes to the ground that deal 100
[12090.98s -> 12103.08s]  damage and stun the enemy on contact. Takes four seconds to recharge. I mean just the crit. Yeah
[12103.08s -> 12112.84s]  those are cool. What does it say? And so it came to pass that the countess who once bathed into
[12112.84s -> 12151.35s]  rejuvenating blood. I think I have that. I have that area. I want to deposit the
[12167.48s -> 12190.78s]  item that I got because I'm afraid of my death. Will this work with fire? It does. Oh
[12190.78s -> 12205.11s]  then I want it. I'm gonna pick this up first because I think I can collect a lot of things.
[12205.11s -> 12221.66s]  What was that? 10,000. I know I didn't forget about the blood. I just want to get this because
[12221.66s -> 12238.04s]  I can level up probably two three times. 10% burn chance. Yep that's a 20. Is that it?
[12238.04s -> 12270.54s]  There's gotta be more than that. Well stream from a library computer. No range. Yeah.
[12301.27s -> 12307.54s]  Okay all the bone rattling. Yeah it just kind of sounds like this colored pencils all over
[12307.54s -> 12328.87s]  the ground. They're just a bunch of rats running in circles. Does this mean that they'll come out
[12328.87s -> 12356.02s]  faster? I think so. All right where's this other piece? Any more range? I picked it up a couple
[12356.02s -> 12363.90s]  times. About the last few times though. All right here it comes. I gotta kill 90 people in here.
[12364.54s -> 12410.63s]  That's not too bad actually. As long as there's no time limit that's fine. Area yep. Oh there's so
[12410.63s -> 12422.73s]  many in there. All right only one more. I got it. I got the whole thing. So now I go back to that
[12422.73s -> 12456.47s]  podium. All right I'm gonna kill this elite. It's gonna give me a bunch of stuff. Fuck I'm gonna die.
[12457.11s -> 12476.26s]  How many elites are there? I'll just run. There's so much bullshit everywhere.
[12479.34s -> 12486.82s]  I need health. I just did I actually just lose it right when I picked it up? Come on.
[12486.82s -> 12527.85s]  That's a big stinker right there. All right orbs. Some health regen and defense. More damage.
[12528.57s -> 12563.77s]  So far so good. Ah shit. This one. You're gonna play portal 2 ever? I played through portal 2.
[12563.77s -> 12569.06s]  I think like two or three times so I don't think I would ever stream portal 2. I mean
[12569.06s -> 12572.90s]  maybe to go back and be like hey remember how good this game was? I guess I'm just gonna play it.
[12573.70s -> 12590.82s]  Oh my god. Okay that was just a I was like a blessed more range. Oh yeah okay more attack speed.
[12593.46s -> 12615.40s]  All right don't blow this now. I need to get healed. Blood trail up. I'm afraid if I deposit
[12615.40s -> 12620.14s]  this thing I'm gonna get killed by whatever comes out of it. Oh whatever. I guess we'll see it.
[12620.78s -> 12635.16s]  People are calling you the pirate of twitch because you don't brush your teeth. Is that true?
[12639.82s -> 12645.72s]  Yeah that's why they call me that. Ah my teeth are fucking black and gray.
[12647.43s -> 12654.87s]  They don't brush me teeth. I never have it. I never will. That's my whole stick. I look
[12654.87s -> 12661.08s]  out and doesn't brush his fucking teeth ever. And I look into the camera and I go like ah.
[12661.96s -> 12669.72s]  I do that every every like five minutes. No I don't want to die please. I want to at least
[12669.72s -> 12686.66s]  deposit this thing. No. Where is it? Where is it? Somebody said a stupid pirate joke and now I've
[12686.66s -> 12708.50s]  I forgot where I am. Where is it? It's right there. I'm just gonna kill this fucking guy right now.
[12708.50s -> 12752.71s]  He's gonna keep just messing with me. Hurry up and die. Did that just save my life? It may have.
[12752.71s -> 12759.64s]  Oh my god damn it dude. I don't. All right all right all right all right. I gotta I just got
[12760.04s -> 12763.82s]  the first time I ever played with that character. That's the first time I've ever played with that
[12763.82s -> 12773.66s]  character okay. Fire damage is now a blessing. I got a new ability. A dragon's breath or something.
[12773.66s -> 12803.42s]  Like I had you have to play to unlock stuff. Fire damage. I'm just gonna go all in. Fire damage and
[12804.14s -> 12820.47s]  damage. Bow and attack speed and projectile size. Can you please say please? Go wide not ah that's
[12820.47s -> 12837.42s]  actually true. So this is wide and a shitload of fire damage. I'll try it. I could afford this.
[12837.42s -> 12849.70s]  Let's do it again. This is fun. I like this game. All right so what do we what do we got?
[12849.70s -> 12865.86s]  I have to kill the lich. Kill a bunch of slimes. How do you do 750,000 in one run?
[12866.42s -> 12878.44s]  This is not in one run so I'm gonna try to take lightning strike again. Stop dying.
[12878.44s -> 12894.62s]  Play for 333 minutes. How long has that been? Kill 100,000 enemies. Crit enemies 50,000 times.
[12895.10s -> 12906.92s]  Deal 10 million damage in total. It's almost there. Collect 20,000. Apply damage effects.
[12906.92s -> 12921.13s]  Kill a total of 10 bosses. Almost there. Apply debuffs 50,000 times. Story. Wait there's a story.
[12921.13s -> 12937.88s]  Reach level 60. Ah it's individual character stuff. Destroy objects. All right reach level 30 with
[12937.88s -> 12949.43s]  the exterminator and then burn. Can chat have a lala? Um in like another six or seven hours.
[12949.51s -> 12956.95s]  I like that each class has their own individual trees kind of go through.
[12956.95s -> 12982.49s]  Hold on let me put this up here. Did it work? Did not. No teeth. Hold on. You guys are linking
[12982.49s -> 12997.34s]  like pirate faces. This is just this is the okay this is the weird magician one right where I was
[12997.34s -> 13006.90s]  like I drank the chaos potion. This is the chaos potion one but this one's a little bit different.
[13006.90s -> 13016.66s]  Okay this is I drank the chaos potion but have since kind of learned to to to be okay with the
[13016.66s -> 13052.63s]  chaos potion enabled. Yeah this is 10 years later after I drank the chaos potion. That's
[13055.21s -> 13061.29s]  that's a good one. That's a really good one. Somebody said dude that looks like a heroes of
[13061.29s -> 13077.77s]  might and magic portrait. It yeah that's perfect. That's an actual good one. Yeah we'll we'll let
[13077.77s -> 13095.70s]  them hang out down here for a little while. Okay face cam. Oh yeah face cam. Look face cam tonight.
[13095.70s -> 13102.09s]  All right so I did burn damage. I need to do I just have to kill I just I just have to survive
[13102.09s -> 13117.34s]  to level 30. I should be able to do that simp very simply. Burn damage is way higher. My
[13118.22s -> 13127.99s]  the other stuff that I did should be good. All right I'm going attack speed. Speed and burn.
[13127.99s -> 13133.50s]  Speed and burn. Speed and burn. I need to I don't care about any of the items. I'm not doing
[13133.50s -> 13140.49s]  anything weird. I just want to get to level 30 on this character. Regen. I want I want to get to
[13140.49s -> 13199.02s]  like two to three health a second. Germa nine matey five. Nice uh hold on this is the character
[13199.02s -> 13222.87s]  I'm playing as. That's like my portrait. I feel like that is gonna just start moving around
[13224.38s -> 13232.38s]  like a full motion video game. When I die that guy over there on the screen is gonna just start
[13232.38s -> 13238.74s]  saying things and then he's it's gonna cut and it's gonna be back to the regular place like
[13238.74s -> 13244.28s]  right there. So he's gonna be like oh almost had me that time and then he's gonna just cut back
[13244.28s -> 13257.93s]  to being a static health regen. I'm going for it now. I know I should have gotten the other thing
[13257.93s -> 13271.51s]  but let me try to get to like one health a second. It'd be so fun to make an FMV game.
[13273.22s -> 13278.62s]  You know I've thought about that over the years. It's just I it'd be so fun to make one of those
[13278.62s -> 13286.12s]  like an old like an old shooter. Get the stunt people make a whole thing over. I think it'd be
[13286.12s -> 13302.62s]  so fun to just like do that. Speed. You officially lost your marbles. I don't think so. I think I'm
[13302.62s -> 13313.22s]  okay. I think I'm doing fine. Are you still making that video? That video was put on hiatus and I
[13313.22s -> 13323.88s]  just never opened it up. So yes I still I do still think about it very frequently. It is in my brain
[13323.96s -> 13338.84s]  very frequently. One day you will see. One day you'll see. It's not really a big deal. I I've
[13338.84s -> 13346.18s]  been talking about this video but I'm trying to set expectations to zero. It's literally one thing
[13346.18s -> 13361.54s]  I think is funny for about eight to ten minutes straight. Oh this is new. Dragon's breath. Damage.
[13361.54s -> 13369.59s]  Yeah what does it do? Ah it just shoots it out like a big wave. Sorry so it's just double fire.
[13370.39s -> 13391.64s]  Oh point 15 additional flame walls and 10% area. Yeah just keep this still as your face cam for the
[13391.64s -> 13404.71s]  rest of the streams. If I actually looked like that I would probably have face cam on every day
[13406.01s -> 13412.49s]  and I would just I would move my face around and be like yeah I would be it would be so fun. It'd
[13412.49s -> 13417.48s]  be so fun to have just like a full head of hair and a gigantic beard like that. I would make all
[13417.48s -> 13436.52s]  kinds of face movements. I would be unbearable. I would be unbearable. Do a vtuber thing.
[13439.94s -> 13446.10s]  What happened? Yeah there's all there's lots of things that I've said I wanted to do but just
[13446.10s -> 13455.22s]  never did it. We talked about the idea. I don't know. Yeah we did. I wanted to make a disgusting
[13455.22s -> 13460.89s]  slime avatar and just have a big cigar hanging out of the mouth and just be awful on stream
[13460.89s -> 13468.12s]  and start at zero and don't tell anybody and just be fucking awful and toxic and mean and shit to
[13468.12s -> 13479.98s]  everybody. Just like talk shit to people in chat like if somebody even asks like a very basic
[13479.98s -> 13483.90s]  question just tell them to like to fuck off and just like make fun of them and stuff.
[13485.74s -> 13508.73s]  This character would be unbearable. All right if that account gets banned do I get banned
[13508.73s -> 13536.26s]  or can I go no it wasn't me it was it was the goblin it was the goblin. That's burn damage is
[13536.26s -> 13580.74s]  doing a lot more. 50. I feel a lot stronger in this one. Definitely going to improve even more.
[13580.74s -> 13585.99s]  Ah which one? Burn chance or additional attacks? I feel like burn chance is probably what to do.
[13585.99s -> 13614.44s]  Is multi hit just best in slot for every character? It probably is. WM1. Sometimes it works. I'm going
[13614.44s -> 13630.78s]  to make my way down to that. Level up one more time. I always damage. All right let's get rid
[13630.78s -> 13647.53s]  of this guy quick. Let's try not to get hit once. All right that was that was clean. That was really
[13647.53s -> 13666.26s]  clean. It was very clean. Feels very good. I think it's this it's this one plus 10 to base attack
[13666.26s -> 13679.98s]  damage that just it's definitely the ring. Look at that. That's amazing. All right now don't mess it
[13679.98s -> 13692.38s]  up because this could be the one at least to get to level 30. What am I missing right now? What
[13692.38s -> 13703.42s]  what could I what could I use? What could I really need? What do I need? Besides the scroll more burn
[13703.50s -> 13726.60s]  more attack speed more movement speed more regen. I am very slow that's true. You need a lot of
[13726.60s -> 13758.70s]  really more movement speed than this. Okay I definitely feel very slow so good idea. This
[13758.70s -> 13781.66s]  fucking pirate picture is so weird. Yes 10 million damage total. What do I get for that? I kind of
[13781.66s -> 13787.18s]  look like somebody cosplaying as a pirate that takes it dead seriously and at a convention you
[13787.18s -> 13790.62s]  see the guy that looks like this and you're like holy shit that guy take this guy that guy means
[13790.62s -> 13836.15s]  business. That guy means business. That's huge. You guys are you guys are fucking crazy. All right
[13836.15s -> 13855.74s]  I gotta get this scroll. Are there two of them now? Wait why are there two of these? No though okay
[13855.74s -> 13863.56s]  the one the that one is I leveled up five times and I think I'm the fucking man even though I'm
[13863.56s -> 13876.63s]  essentially the same character. I'm just like level six instead of level one. All right I gotta
[13876.87s -> 13896.78s]  get back to pay attention. This shoe is through people especially the ability power I think is
[13896.78s -> 13905.37s]  great. Um health regen yeah I need it I want it. I can't just do offense only it's the only reason
[13905.37s -> 13922.82s]  why I keep losing. Wow that's so good that was very good holy shit. I just I actually want to
[13922.82s -> 13951.56s]  say this but it is the title but I just mowed down an entire wave. What is this? I hate this.
[13952.28s -> 13962.14s]  I hate this. Okay I'm gonna use it. What is going on in the world man? What is going on in the world?
[13962.14s -> 13988.97s]  Hold on. What is happening in the world? We've gone too far. How come it's not moving? It's not moving.
[13988.97s -> 14002.47s]  This one's supposed to be moving. This is a gif. I can't get it. Can you make it a video source?
[14002.47s -> 14011.45s]  I don't think so. Hold on. How come this is not playing as a gif? He got he got closer.
[14014.23s -> 14045.82s]  Yeah I just I just leaned in like five feet. Save it as a gif. Okay it's very weird. Okay I I have
[14045.82s -> 14050.38s]  like so many of these saved to my desktop now. No that was a wrong one. I didn't want to put
[14050.38s -> 14083.00s]  that one on. I have so many versions of this now. Okay there it is. Did it work? Why not? Why not?
[14083.00s -> 14115.90s]  This is just this is a different guy. This is not even me. All right I'll leave it for five minutes.
[14115.90s -> 14145.50s]  Uh movement speed. I need it. More regen if I can get it. Yep I want it. Okay I'm almost at one
[14145.50s -> 14180.01s]  per second which is a big deal. I think this is the one. This is a great great great great great
[14180.01s -> 14196.78s]  great great start. What should I actually get with this character? Because I really don't know. Orbs?
[14196.78s -> 14200.86s]  I don't know. Orbs kind of feel not I don't know feel like orbs aren't really doing very much.
[14200.86s -> 14236.09s]  This is creeping us out. Needles? Give me another dragon breath. Raid coming in. Vine sauce raid.
[14236.09s -> 14247.51s]  Vinny. What's up Vinny? Welcome raiders. Welcome ein sauce viewers. Oh and my face cam was just
[14247.51s -> 14258.54s]  off. Let me turn it back on. Throwing the beard out a little. Thanks for the raid Vinny. Hope you had
[14258.54s -> 14264.30s]  a good stream. I hope you guys had a good time watching. We're playing halls of torment. Games
[14264.30s -> 14285.24s]  fucking lit. See I can talk. I'm I'm with it. I'm hip. You have to see Austin powers.
[14285.24s -> 14307.06s]  I'm cool. I'm with it. I'm hip. Oh that one. Austin powers is so good. It really is. Yeah.
[14308.02s -> 14320.76s]  All right so I'm gonna turn this off to not scare all of the vine sauce viewers. This thing is
[14320.76s -> 14327.77s]  gonna be disgusting now. Look at that. Look at that wave. Look at that wave of death. Sorry
[14327.77s -> 14339.11s]  I got a little uh a little overzealous there. Which one would you pick? I'm not sure which one.
[14343.69s -> 14364.39s]  I'm leaning towards attack speed or defense. Any of them? Yeah this is like vampire survivors
[14365.03s -> 14373.24s]  but it's a little different and I'll tell you this is very good. I've played a lot of the vampire
[14373.24s -> 14383.66s]  survivor likes. I think this one is probably it's it's definitely not probably the most fun I've had
[14383.66s -> 14389.18s]  in a vampire survivor's like that was not vampire survivors. I think that with time with a ton of
[14389.18s -> 14394.38s]  additions because the game's not even in beta yet uh I think it seems pretty good. This seems
[14394.38s -> 14401.83s]  pretty fun. It's a good baseline. Depends on how much they add. Have you tried bro tato? I have. I
[14401.83s -> 14408.44s]  have played bro tato but this to me feels the most like vampire survivors. The same kind of
[14408.44s -> 14422.52s]  aesthetic. Remember what we said. I'm all about aesthetic. It sucks that I have to choose this
[14422.52s -> 14450.97s]  but I'm going to. Ah yep. I think I'm all right now. I don't think I need movement speed anymore.
[14459.70s -> 14474.71s]  All right go get the parchment. Have you tried to hollow cure? I have not. I have not. I don't know.
[14474.71s -> 14479.14s]  I don't know. Is it good? Is it like a vampire survivor's game?
[14497.19s -> 14503.14s]  I got it level 30. Nice damage with the yeah 20% more damage. I don't get caught up here.
[14503.94s -> 14518.92s]  This is a good one. I got a good run going. I'm melting these things. Remember how horrible these
[14518.92s -> 14534.06s]  were an hour ago? Not even like 40 minutes ago. I just did a million fire damage. Dragon's Breath
[14534.06s -> 14565.10s]  knocks back enemies. Yep. Damage. Nice. Oh I'm gonna unlock the whole tree for the exterminator.
[14566.14s -> 14590.82s]  Crit chance. Health. Um have I haven't deposited an item. Have I take the boots? I think I want
[14590.82s -> 14597.85s]  to take this and deposit this one. This thing is just uh yeah I'll switch the room. I want to
[14597.85s -> 14616.52s]  deposit this. Yeah I'll take the hood and deposit the drink. All right this is where I have to
[14616.52s -> 14620.84s]  snowball big time because even though I'm doing a lot of damage and I'm fine that changes very
[14620.84s -> 14632.42s]  quickly in four and a half minutes. I'm going to go I'm not going to do the well yet but I'm going
[14632.42s -> 14646.47s]  to do the um might as well. I'm going to go grab that magnet because I wonder how far away it is.
[14647.85s -> 14672.78s]  Crit chance now. If it shows up yeah. Pick up range is a big deal too. Yeah I have completely
[14672.78s -> 14677.85s]  completely neglected pick up range. I do kill things very quickly though.
[14698.50s -> 14709.22s]  Oh this is like god mode. No it's not just invincibility but just take the opportunity
[14709.22s -> 14730.34s]  to run fast. Geez that hurt. Pick up range or let's just do it. I'm safe right now. Plus I'm
[14730.34s -> 14752.54s]  going to level up a ton of times in about 10 seconds. Rotato doesn't have a good art style.
[14752.54s -> 14759.80s]  Rotato was very fun. Rotato does this thing where they say hey do you like this game. Oh you do like
[14759.80s -> 14763.72s]  this game. Well okay well now you're going to play it for a thousand hours because there's like 200
[14763.72s -> 14776.14s]  characters and there's seven difficulties. Like oh okay and each character needs to beat each
[14776.14s -> 14785.35s]  difficulty. Have fun. Okay well now that's that's awesome. Yeah I played a lot of Rotato on the
[14785.35s -> 14811.37s]  iPad. I know. I didn't want to tell you. Crit uh more regen whatever. Offense is not a problem
[14811.37s -> 14836.44s]  right now. Always going to be moving forward. That's uh oh. How far away is this thing? There
[14836.44s -> 14863.24s]  it is. Mow it down. Mow it down. All right go. There's your crit damage bonus. Should I just get
[14863.24s -> 14888.07s]  more health? Yeah. Uh more area. Oh yep. Come on. Additional flame wall and more area. This is maxed
[14888.07s -> 14921.11s]  out. 20% more range and more area. That's maxed out. Movement speed. Holy shit. Trans-transfiction?
[14921.11s -> 14925.88s]  Transfiction? Virus projectile is in the direction you're facing. Damage is reduced for every enemy
[14925.88s -> 14942.07s]  hit. What's that? Is this good? Damage is reduced for every enemy hit. Just get orbs instead. Well
[14942.07s -> 14955.99s]  what about lightning? It's archer as an ability. Do not pick it. Pick this. Pick lightning. Orbs.
[14955.99s -> 14960.36s]  Orbs I think is lightning is the safest because I don't have to think about it. It just will hit
[14960.36s -> 14998.30s]  stuff. Uh crit chance. There's so much shit everywhere. Uh piercing? Does that work for fire?
[14998.30s -> 15041.93s]  I think I'm just going crit. Yeah. All right get it all. This pickup range is such dog shit. All
[15041.93s -> 15045.37s]  right. I'm about to fight the boss. I've not I've not killed this yet. Oh wait. This actually
[15045.37s -> 15048.33s]  will be great against these enemies because these things are so annoying. They just like kind of
[15048.33s -> 15071.42s]  cycle on you. Oops. Oh shit. Oh my god. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm all right.
[15071.42s -> 15097.61s]  Everything's fine. Everyone relax. Shit. Oh I'm just I'm just barely barely. I'm okay. Everything's
[15097.61s -> 15152.07s]  all right. I am taking a lot more damage than I should be though. Uh god. Well worst thing that
[15152.07s -> 15195.42s]  happens is. All right. All right. Holy shit. Oh my god. It's just too many. Die you piece of shit.
[15195.42s -> 15220.36s]  Yes. Oh elven slippers. I gotta deposit something. Increases block strength while moving. Builds up
[15220.36s -> 15225.66s]  by moved distance. Block strength is limited to 10. Movement speed buffs increase the cap. Standing
[15225.66s -> 15234.18s]  still remove. I I have to read that like five more times. Increases block strength while moving.
[15234.74s -> 15244.10s]  So I can build up to 10 block by moving around. If I have movement speed buffs that goes over 10.
[15244.66s -> 15259.16s]  But if I stop moving it's all gone. Uh how why would I not have take this. 4% additional damage
[15259.16s -> 15264.97s]  for each burning enemy. That's unbelievable. I hope I don't die instantly after taking this.
[15265.61s -> 15279.43s]  Um I guess just put it in my backpack. Okay here we go. I'm already at the cap. No don't lose it
[15279.43s -> 15335.94s]  right now. Come on. I have to go deposit this. Wish me luck. Shit. Okay. Uh range. I'm gonna do
[15335.94s -> 15371.99s]  range. I have to keep that helmet. It's imperative. Oh fuck. Put it in. Okay. All right.
[15371.99s -> 15381.02s]  I'm good. I'm good. This thing is amazing. It's gonna kill the run but it's okay. Don't. I want
[15381.02s -> 15406.41s]  to put this up. No. I want to put this up here. How do I put that up there? Okay. Geez. All right.
[15406.41s -> 15415.96s]  This is gonna be the end here. Got to keep finding spots to move. Five more minutes of this. I don't
[15415.96s -> 15423.66s]  know about that. We'll see. If there's health I'm just gonna take it. I'm going for healing only at
[15423.66s -> 15478.89s]  this point. There we go. Oh this is not good. Health. Block strength right? Quick. Don't think
[15478.89s -> 15485.74s]  of a pink elephant. Why did you do that? There's a magnet right above you. Pick up range. There is
[15485.74s -> 15489.34s]  a magnet right here. All right. Here we go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[15489.98s -> 15501.61s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Holy shit. Um even more dragon's breath.
[15509.38s -> 15579.38s]  Oh. Uh. I'm dead. I'm dead. Uh. I'm okay. There's cheese right here. I'll give me a healing potion.
[15579.38s -> 15623.53s]  Yikes. Avoid the slimes. They're the worst. They turn into like five enemies. Huge. I thought the
[15623.53s -> 15627.70s]  pirate image was still up doing the animation. I was about to be like oh shit. How do I take that
[15627.70s -> 15651.26s]  off? Healing. Jesus. There's so many. This way. This way. There's a gap. There's a gap. There's a gap.
[15651.26s -> 15733.67s]  This way. How much time is left? Like a minute right? I don't want to look. 20 seconds. All
[15733.67s -> 15758.62s]  right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Just don't get cocky. Yes. Oh shit. It's a real boss.
[15766.90s -> 15832.57s]  Okay. Well you do that. Oh this is hard. This is hard. Oh man. Damn it. I took a lot of damage
[15832.57s -> 15849.10s]  early. Just learning the move set. That was the downfall. I unlocked a lot of stuff. It's a lot.
[15849.18s -> 15872.18s]  Trait. Stance. Proficiency. Four. I got a lot of money. Ring of fire. This character is good.
[15872.18s -> 15888.23s]  Trait type. Flammability and recovery. Firewalker boots. Sparking tips. Cleric. Oh new character.
[15888.23s -> 15897.88s]  Unlocks upgrades stream of fire. All right. I probably have like five or six grand. Ten grand.
[15897.88s -> 15930.22s]  Cleric. That's so much money. It's so good but I think. What's the cleric? Wooden ring is the best.
[15931.22s -> 15936.82s]  It just. Yeah. It's just great. I'll just get. I want to buy upgrades though. I don't want to buy
[15936.82s -> 15948.07s]  all these items. I want the pickup. Attack speed's great but I feel like I'm lacking. End of the
[15948.07s -> 15956.17s]  stream. No. I'll play. I'll do a couple more. It's a chill stream. The whole stream is end of the
[15956.17s -> 15983.11s]  stream voice. I think this is good for now. I want to do some upgrades. Okay. What did I unlock?
[15983.11s -> 15997.90s]  Health capacity. Did I have that? I think I had that before. Turn on auto aim. It's efficient. I
[15997.90s -> 16002.74s]  had it on for like at the end of the boss fight there. Just trying to focus on dodging the circles
[16002.74s -> 16013.00s]  but I got hit too many times. I don't know what this character is so I'm just going to do some
[16013.00s -> 16017.96s]  basic stuff. I think that's. I mean you can't go wrong with damage and you can't go wrong with
[16017.96s -> 16025.99s]  attack speed. So I guess that's what we're doing before we figure out what this character does.
[16026.71s -> 16056.26s]  You feeling beachy today? Yeah. Whoa. Okay. What kind of damage is that?
[16070.58s -> 16081.54s]  Dun dun. That's a lot of 500. All right. This is if you want to do damage on this
[16081.54s -> 16098.62s]  and attack speed. I'll try the auto aim. Should I plug the controller in? Let me try it with
[16098.62s -> 16103.91s]  the controller. I'm curious. How does it work with controller? How fun is it with controller?
[16103.91s -> 16131.00s]  Because I just have auto aim is on and it moves in my d-pad. It's actually recommended. Much better.
[16131.00s -> 16135.96s]  I do prefer analog moving around with a character like this. Auto and use your thumb stick when you
[16135.96s -> 16143.14s]  want to clear in front of you. Whoa. That's a million times better than what I was just
[16143.14s -> 16155.82s]  doing for the last five, four and a half hours. Well, that's for those of you that want to be
[16155.82s -> 16162.97s]  precise. Uh, then no, but you can be precise. I I'm holding the analog and I'm aiming.
[16162.97s -> 16182.26s]  Is it on game pass? Is it like vampire survivors? I would say it is heavily influenced by vampire
[16182.26s -> 16192.04s]  survivors. Heavily. I will tell you this is probably my this is I'm enjoying this a lot.
[16194.09s -> 16203.18s]  This is I played every vampire survivors DLC. I feel like I'm starting vampire survivors over
[16203.18s -> 16210.66s]  at zero again. And that's something that you just can't do. You can. But I mean, after you have
[16210.66s -> 16221.86s]  hundreds of hours in vampire survivors, I get to start over it on a whole new one. Now that's fun.
[16221.86s -> 16242.81s]  So I can just aim here. Wow. Okay. That's disgusting. I wonder if it's good to do it
[16242.81s -> 16257.59s]  with this character. Let me just see what it does. It shoots out. It's pretty frequent.
[16258.15s -> 16282.20s]  I thought it was going to be a lot slower than that. Clerics cannot crit. That's why they are
[16282.20s -> 16294.18s]  doing so much damage. I see. But I just did. And I just crit. I just crit right there. Wait,
[16294.18s -> 16299.06s]  do you mean the the move there, the actual auto attack that I have? Because I have not seen that
[16299.06s -> 16306.20s]  crit. I got one guide. I don't I have not seen my regular attack crit though. I think they're
[16306.20s -> 16311.77s]  correct. I think they got it right. The abilities can create but my this cannot. I don't think.
[16313.40s -> 16345.02s]  Technically they're correct. More projectiles. Yes. You just start with zero crit. Okay, base
[16345.02s -> 16355.00s]  zero percent. But it's improvable. This is the kind of character I really like to play. I like
[16355.56s -> 16368.92s]  massive damage. But first, I think it's fun. 20% more damage and more range. Yeah. Look at that.
[16368.92s -> 16385.75s]  It's doing less damage. Wait, it's doing more damage based on the distance. Is that correct?
[16385.75s -> 16396.95s]  Am I wrong? I'm trying to figure this out. Splits between the AOE. This is a boss killer.
[16400.02s -> 16408.95s]  It's divided on who's hit. That's a boss killer then. It's doing 400 damage. 600.
[16409.67s -> 16419.35s]  Yeah, that's crazy. So then I should start building crit because then now I have five percent.
[16420.15s -> 16424.98s]  A crit with a thousand damage on a boss would be ridiculous.
[16442.58s -> 16460.65s]  Area. Somebody's first time chatter. I think I'm I think I'm turning into mush. I'm gonna help you
[16460.65s -> 16472.02s]  here. Let me help you out here. Get a glass of water. Drink a glass of water. Sit down. Stretch
[16472.02s -> 16478.26s]  for a little bit. Stretch both your arms up in the air. Stretch up. Kind of puff your chest out a
[16478.26s -> 16486.34s]  little. Stand up. Kind of move around. Let that water really just get into your muscles and into
[16486.34s -> 16494.04s]  your muscle fibers. Make sure you're going outside and you're getting at least five minutes of
[16494.04s -> 16499.61s]  sunshine a day. I don't care what you do out there. Just go out there. Let the sun hit you in the face
[16502.17s -> 16512.57s]  for five minutes a day. At least. If it's really really hot where you are. The sun is just beaming.
[16512.57s -> 16522.58s]  Put on a little bit of sunscreen. Put on a little bit of SPF. You'll be all right. You gotta turn
[16522.58s -> 16529.03s]  that vitamin D into you got you have to synthesize the vitamin D in your body. Let that sun just hit
[16529.03s -> 16539.03s]  you right in the face for a few minutes. Synthesize the vitamin D in your bloodstream. But you can
[16539.03s -> 16550.39s]  take a supplement. You cannot. You cannot supplement our mother earth. Well, our son.
[16555.88s -> 16561.85s]  Is that what he goes? Okay dude. Okay dude. This is. Look at how much damage this does.
[16562.49s -> 16579.40s]  Thousand? I gotta get him alone. Wow. Okay this character is filthy. An iron mouse raid.
[16579.40s -> 16586.89s]  What's up? Thank you iron mouse. Welcome everybody. Thanks for the raid. We're just chilling out
[16586.89s -> 16598.63s]  playing some halls of torment. Thank you iron mouse. Hope you had a good stream. Raid song?
[16598.63s -> 16612.47s]  We did get two raids but it's. No. But thank you. Welcome. This game is sick. It's very good. And I
[16612.47s -> 16617.51s]  believe. Tell me if I'm wrong. I believe the beta comes out tomorrow. The beta for this game I think
[16617.51s -> 16621.75s]  is tomorrow. They're adding a bunch of stuff tomorrow. That's pretty. That's pretty cool.
[16621.75s -> 16632.34s]  Iron mouse loves it. It's great. Yeah. Iron mouse you got great taste. Uh it's it's a wind crown.
[16633.06s -> 16653.88s]  Remind me to deposit this because I'll forget. Show your your your vtuber model.
[16653.88s -> 16683.53s]  Oh you mean this. I mean this old thing. This is. Fuck. Stop it. Stop it. It's allowed to be up there
[16683.53s -> 16697.99s]  for 10 to 15 seconds. It's been way longer than that but it's okay. That's what it looked like
[16697.99s -> 16713.85s]  in real life by the way. I just want everyone to know that. Funny sometimes I'll look in the
[16713.85s -> 16729.56s]  mirrors. I've tried to grow a beard before and it's just it's very it's very hard to do. More attacks.
[16729.56s -> 16748.86s]  Yep. Okay. That's all we needed that for. Any tips on growing a mustache. No my facial hair is
[16749.42s -> 16756.39s]  like I'm like the scarecrow. It's it's like straw coming out of my face. I can't do it.
[16758.74s -> 16764.50s]  It's funny the last like couple of months I've tried but a month will go by and then we have a
[16764.50s -> 16772.79s]  string of 110 115 degree days and I go I can't I gotta get this off. It's it's driving me crazy
[16772.79s -> 16775.59s]  and then another month will go by and I'll be like you know I'm gonna try to grow the beard again
[16775.59s -> 16796.39s]  and then and it's another string of 115 degree days and like get this off me. What's the name
[16796.39s -> 16803.77s]  of your pirate vtuber model. Oh that's easy. Arthur. Everybody that came from Iron Mouse's
[16803.77s -> 16811.03s]  channel you can leave now like that. I get it. I get it. If you're you know that was so all I
[16811.03s -> 16821.22s]  yeah I get it. Like if you want to just take off. I get it. I'm really sorry. If you're here for if
[16821.22s -> 16825.75s]  you're in my community that's here now you can you can leave too. You can leave too. That was
[16825.75s -> 16831.06s]  that was that was a that was a lever. That was a lever. You can that was like you're hovering
[16831.06s -> 16843.62s]  over the X. Yeah it's time to go. I got like dinner to eat and shit. No stay stay stay stay please.
[16846.90s -> 16860.81s]  What was Iron Mouse playing? What was Iron Mouse doing? Wrist Drain. That's another one that I
[16860.81s -> 16866.74s]  really want to. I feel like me and Italics played that for a day or two or me at least stir as well.
[16867.46s -> 16872.73s]  I feel like we played that really really really early in the early access years ago and just
[16872.73s -> 16894.58s]  never played it ever again. Early adopter abandoning Andy. I feel like that happens a lot
[16894.58s -> 16901.58s]  whenever I play an early access game. I play it and I go oh whoa this sounds this looks so much fun.
[16901.58s -> 16908.70s]  This is cool. Oh it's not going to be done for like four years. Oh okay I guess I'll come back
[16908.70s -> 16914.47s]  later and then I just don't come back. I don't know if that's entirely true because I feel like
[16914.47s -> 16932.74s]  there's some early access games I really got into and kept playing later. Yeah name ten.
[16935.30s -> 16945.14s]  Coin game. Was that game in early access? It might it may not have ever been. Oh that's one.
[16950.84s -> 16956.70s]  Vampire Survivors. That was another big one. Yeah I played that pretty much all the way through.
[16959.67s -> 16973.05s]  Ultra Kill. I've played pretty much every Ultra Kill update. There's three. I played the Gloomwood
[16973.05s -> 16988.54s]  demo. I didn't play the early access. Technically you went back to Diablo 4. Oh wait is this a
[16988.54s -> 17006.54s]  Diablo 4 is an early access joke? Oh I see. Let me tell you about Jam. You played the beta?
[17009.80s -> 17018.46s]  Yeah I played the beta. Hey how do you how do you guys feel about Diablo 2?
[17019.10s -> 17032.20s]  Crippling cuts add shots in a backwards direction. I mean I want to see it. Plus 166 base damage.
[17032.68s -> 17048.36s]  I'm not sure which one of these is the one to take. Probably the fourth one. What about Dark
[17048.36s -> 17052.76s]  and Darker? Yeah but Dark and Darker sits in a weird place right now. I'm not sure if that
[17052.76s -> 17058.54s]  game is ever going to release. I mean I don't know the story. I kind of caught up on the first part
[17058.54s -> 17064.95s]  when it was kind of came off steam and everything. Which isn't that's unfortunate because I really
[17064.95s -> 17074.10s]  did I really liked that game. So I don't know what the deal is with that but I I mean me and
[17074.10s -> 17078.12s]  Holly were sitting around talking about it. It's like oh man Dark and Darker I think this is going
[17078.12s -> 17082.68s]  to be the game. This is going to be the game that I play a lot and I'm going to put a bunch of time
[17082.68s -> 17088.28s]  into it. I love it and it just gets fucking delisted from steam. The one game that I talk
[17088.28s -> 17093.48s]  about how much like oh man I'm super excited about it has been delisted from steam and there's like a
[17093.48s -> 17106.39s]  lawsuit now. Oh well I was excited about that one. I think you just like the dark fantasy setting.
[17106.39s -> 17117.98s]  Oh yeah absolutely. Dark medieval fantasy is probably my favorite setting. Have we decided
[17117.98s -> 17124.49s]  which one I'm taking? It's supposed to still be coming out. Well I hope whatever happens I hope
[17124.49s -> 17134.28s]  it gets resolved and I hope we get to see a cool product but yeah we'll see. Take one. One is more
[17134.28s -> 17151.77s]  yeah that's I don't know. I was never a big Tarkov fan but the concept of Tarkov was really
[17151.77s -> 17160.30s]  interesting. That you need to take items with you and if you don't take them with you they're gone
[17160.38s -> 17165.98s]  but you do have a stash. That it was a lot of I don't know it's cool that's cool that you just
[17165.98s -> 17169.26s]  kind of I'm gonna put on all my good stuff and really try this time and then you get killed in
[17169.26s -> 17173.18s]  one hit in the head and you throw your hands up and go well congratulations you just opened up a
[17173.18s -> 17198.15s]  fucking loot pinata and then that we make that person's whole week. I never thought I'd hear you
[17198.15s -> 17208.36s]  talk about Tarkov. I just wish and this is just me being a selfish selfish person maybe it's not.
[17209.54s -> 17217.69s]  I just wish they would stop making shooting games and spend more time making games that
[17217.69s -> 17225.85s]  could work in that world in that sort of shooter br kind of world and I just want I wish we got more
[17225.85s -> 17232.52s]  stuff that wasn't a shooter. Dark and Darker was not a shooter but it followed the same rules as
[17232.52s -> 17242.73s]  a lot of those games that are shooters. Does it hurt being so correct? I don't even know if it's
[17242.73s -> 17253.32s]  a correct or incorrect thing it's just what I want. That's why I said it was selfish. That's
[17253.32s -> 17262.06s]  what I want. A lot of shooters have come out that a lot of people play you know like Valorant, Apex,
[17262.86s -> 17268.86s]  Tarkov. What's that other one? There's another like you know Counter-Strike. I don't I don't
[17268.86s -> 17274.78s]  put Counter-Strike in this category because I think Counter-Strike has been around for so long
[17275.58s -> 17281.27s]  that it just is it to me Counter-Strike just is the shooter. It's just the shooter. It's just the
[17281.27s -> 17291.80s]  shooter to me. Everything else is sort of in a weird kind of cloud above it for me. Overwatch?
[17291.80s -> 17307.69s]  Yeah it was a different it was it was different but I liked Overwatch when it came out the first
[17307.69s -> 17312.20s]  like year or two. I played it all I streamed it all the time. Some of the people that are new to
[17312.20s -> 17319.78s]  this channel might not know back in like 2016-2017 I played Overwatch on stream like once a week.
[17320.34s -> 17333.35s]  I played it a lot. That was a game I played. I enjoyed it. It just kind of started to get a
[17333.35s -> 17342.71s]  little out of hand for me and then Overwatch 2 was just like I don't really I don't see a reason
[17342.71s -> 17354.20s]  to play it. I just didn't really I mean I played Overwatch. I missed this pew. Is your favorite
[17354.20s -> 17369.19s]  Overwatch character? I really liked Zenyatta and Lucio. I thought they were great. He's shit faced.
[17369.19s -> 17377.96s]  I'm not. I liked how they did support in Overwatch. It was fun. It was. Zenyatta was fun to play. It
[17377.96s -> 17385.88s]  was a really fun take on a healer in a shooting game. It was really cool putting that orb on
[17385.88s -> 17394.54s]  people. The healing orb. It was a really well designed character. They made support really fun
[17394.54s -> 17403.37s]  to play in Overwatch but the rest of the game I was not like a massive huge fan of after the
[17403.37s -> 17423.05s]  first year or two. 2016-2018 Overwatch was a time to be alive. It was fun. It was very fun. I sort
[17423.05s -> 17436.18s]  of microbalanced it to hell. I'm not sure if this character is just really good or if I just turned
[17436.18s -> 17440.66s]  my brain off and started playing very well. I think it's probably a combination of both.
[17453.18s -> 17458.20s]  All right. We've not seen this yet. Every 15 seconds you summon a skeleton to fight for you.
[17458.20s -> 17475.13s]  They will perish after a set time but their life force can be extended. I don't know if I can take
[17475.13s -> 17487.74s]  this off. Is 50% attack speed worse than having a skeleton walk around? Oh wait it's a ring. I
[17487.74s -> 17501.40s]  thought it was a helmet. I thought that was a mouth and two eyes. It's a ring. Okay. What should I
[17501.40s -> 17512.94s]  I'm probably gonna say. I just froze for a second. This character doesn't do very many crits so let's
[17512.94s -> 17523.56s]  put this away and put this on. All right let's see what the skeletons look like. One of five
[17523.56s -> 17532.94s]  skeletons. All right there he is. Remind me to deposit this because which one should I deposit?
[17533.02s -> 17545.54s]  Duration? The duration abilities and or summonings. Oh yeah you should put throw a wind crown in
[17545.54s -> 17552.38s]  there for sure. But look at how cool this item is. You mean I could have five skeletons at the
[17552.38s -> 17581.78s]  beginning of the game? That's kind of fun. They're kind of doing work. They take aggro. It's hard to
[17581.78s -> 17596.36s]  tell but they're doing almost 90 damage a hit. I think these things are pretty good. They fight
[17596.36s -> 17610.06s]  off screen. Oh that's a big deal. Look at how huge that is. You know what else I think has made me
[17610.06s -> 17618.79s]  improve? The controller. WASD versus the two analogues. Yeah this is just much easier to play
[17618.79s -> 17652.92s]  I think. Wait is that a skeleton mage? That's cool you can spawn those. You might as well go skeleton
[17652.92s -> 17670.17s]  build. I've got like a 13 minutes left. This has been going very well. Uh movement speed. Especially
[17670.17s -> 17678.31s]  if I'm gonna fight the last boss again. There's no way I'll die in three four seconds. I should
[17678.31s -> 17693.13s]  have enough damage. That'll be what like two or three thousand a hit. Uh oh I gotta just power
[17693.13s -> 17706.01s]  through it. Hey dude your hot pocket is ready. Oh that took a while. How long has it been? Five
[17706.01s -> 17750.33s]  hours? I don't think that it's edible anymore. More duration. I just max it out. It's cold in
[17750.33s -> 17757.99s]  the middle. That was always the worst. I remember I haven't had hot pockets in a while. A long time
[17757.99s -> 17764.39s]  but I do remember you'd get one bite that was burning hot that burnt your mouth and then the
[17764.39s -> 17782.81s]  one right after that sometimes would be lukewarm. But when you got it perfect. When it was when it
[17782.81s -> 17787.93s]  heated up just right. We're talking Goldilocks situation. It is perfect. Perfect temperature
[17787.93s -> 17797.56s]  all the way through. The meatball hot pocket was my absolute gem. I probably lived off of those
[17797.56s -> 17804.49s]  for a significant period of time. I could have if I needed to. You know what else I lived off of?
[17807.42s -> 17814.71s]  Corned beef hash out of the can. I used to eat that stuff all the time. It's like one of my
[17814.71s -> 17831.14s]  favorite foods. Oh shit. All right give me that. Dragon's breath is really good but I don't know
[17831.14s -> 17838.71s]  if it's got all the bonuses. You're not supposed to admit that. What? That I like corned beef hash?
[17839.43s -> 17848.71s]  The canned corned beef hash? Yeah you cook. No not raw. All right how come every time I say a food
[17848.71s -> 17855.80s]  I like you guys assume it is raw out of the box. Oh man I'm you know I really just love a nice
[17855.80s -> 17864.81s]  salmon. Why are you eating raw salmon? What? You said out of the can. Yeah corned beef hash out of
[17864.81s -> 17869.69s]  the can. Because you can get corned beef hash from a ton of breakfast places. You can make corned
[17869.69s -> 17875.69s]  beef hash. It's just corned beef and potatoes and onions. I'm talking about like the Hormel
[17875.69s -> 17892.55s]  corned beef hash out of the can. Not straight out of the can with a spoon. Like no. You put
[17892.55s -> 17898.22s]  an over medium egg on top of a serving of corned beef hash Hormel and then you
[17900.98s -> 17916.73s]  with Tabasco. Get out of here. That's like one of the best things to eat. That's some real
[17917.45s -> 17924.78s]  that's some real good eating. That's good eat. One fried egg on a nice portion of corned beef hash.
[17926.04s -> 17934.76s]  A couple of dupe dupes of Tabasco and maybe some you know what let's get fucking freaky.
[17935.72s -> 17941.74s]  How about a couple of heirloom tomatoes on the side from the oven. Like four or five of them.
[17941.74s -> 17962.17s]  Oof. Get the scroll. All right I'm going. And a whole roast beef? No. Get the scroll dude. I'm
[17962.17s -> 17974.84s]  going. I only got 10 minutes. I'm gonna beat this one. Where'd everybody go? Oh that was weird.
[17975.48s -> 18011.90s]  That was kind of weird. But I do think that D4 is gonna be. All right I'll stop. I am unstoppable.
[18016.46s -> 18023.77s]  Great damage. You've been talking about Diablo for four hours. I've talked about Diablo for
[18024.81s -> 18033.61s]  maybe like 38 minutes total across four hours. It's not been four straight hours. It's been across
[18034.25s -> 18042.54s]  trickled in over four hours. Five minutes here. Two minutes there. Seven minutes there. Six minutes
[18042.54s -> 18054.09s]  here. It's not been the whole time. It's been a portion of the time. What's the best salad dressing?
[18056.38s -> 18079.53s]  Olive oil. Any more questions? I'm just reading chat and just walked through a whole group of
[18079.53s -> 18095.32s]  enemies. Look at that health regen. Tick tick tick tick. That's my health going up. Why do you talk
[18095.32s -> 18099.96s]  about food so much? I think food is one of the most important things that humanity has ever
[18099.96s -> 18105.32s]  created. I think that like food and culture around food I think is probably our greatest
[18105.32s -> 18113.99s]  achievement as a species. People think it's going to the moon. People think it's like no no it's
[18115.26s -> 18135.96s]  the guy that made a pizza for the first time. The first person that's like you know what I'm
[18135.96s -> 18144.98s]  the person that invented baklava. That's kind of remarkable. Look at what we've created with food.
[18145.62s -> 18155.13s]  Look what we've created with food. Welcome to episode two of food for thought. Me,
[18155.77s -> 18168.97s]  grandpile which you know I was thinking the other day who made uh wait this is important.
[18168.97s -> 18175.82s]  Firewalker boots? While you move you produce a trail of fire that damages your enemies.
[18177.72s -> 18181.88s]  Uh I have so many items that I want to deposit but I don't know which one is the cool one.
[18186.58s -> 18200.47s]  This seems incredible to put on the fire character. This one is cool. This one is just
[18201.11s -> 18217.27s]  the best one arguably but this one might be really fun. I can't wait until that's your real voice.
[18217.27s -> 18223.75s]  Well you're gonna have to wait about 40 years. Is your favorite Trader Joe's item still the
[18224.63s -> 18232.38s]  the chicken tikka masala? Yes. Butter chicken does fill it in. They have this new bowl. They
[18232.38s -> 18237.11s]  have these bowls there that are really good now. If you try to move something with your mind. Let
[18237.11s -> 18243.77s]  me try the thing on your desk. Let me try the uh the the matchbox. The the box of matches on
[18243.77s -> 18262.62s]  your desk. Let me try to move them right now. The red ones. The red. Ready? Did it work? Did
[18262.62s -> 18273.66s]  somebody just say holy shit dude stop you moved my house. I'm gonna move the matchbox on your desk.
[18273.66s -> 18284.62s]  I've ripped your house's foundation off and just goes into the air. Uh I'm gonna I'm gonna take
[18284.62s -> 18303.42s]  him because it's fun and whatever. Seven more minutes and I'm good. I'm putting them on. Okay
[18303.42s -> 18317.32s]  so the trail does not last very long but it is cool looking. Are you the reason why the earth
[18317.32s -> 18337.51s]  rotates on an axis? Nah. They're okay. You should play Psychonauts. I was never a fan of just action
[18337.51s -> 18352.94s]  platform games like that. I don't know why. Roughness. Games like Ratchet and Clank I put
[18352.94s -> 18360.31s]  in that same category. Is it wrong for me to say that I put Jack and Jackster, Ratchet and Clank,
[18360.31s -> 18367.29s]  and Psychonauts is in that category? Is that accurate? Because that's as a genre I don't
[18367.29s -> 18381.48s]  usually play. I'm weird. The game I play needs to have weird stakes. It has to be stakes with
[18381.48s -> 18392.66s]  whatever game I'm playing. You really break it down. To me Jack and Jack and Dexter does not have
[18392.66s -> 18401.64s]  stakes. It's just like a fun cool game to play which is fine but I want I needed to be stakes.
[18402.28s -> 18420.20s]  What are the stakes in House Flipper? They're there because in House Flipper without cheating
[18422.52s -> 18428.84s]  you're you're trying to make money to buy the better houses to sell to flip to get more money
[18428.84s -> 18433.56s]  to buy the bigger houses to flip there are stakes there you need to like spend the money you need
[18433.56s -> 18440.82s]  to make money and spend it there's like these negotiations yeah what are the stakes in Elden
[18440.82s -> 18448.02s]  Ring you holding on to souls for too long and losing them that is like the stakes game what
[18448.02s -> 18467.27s]  are you come on gwen come on gwen what are you talking about that's a reach how is it okay wait
[18467.27s -> 18475.38s]  Elden Ring you tell me Elden Ring does not have stakes like something you you have to put it up
[18475.38s -> 18481.94s]  right you got to level up you got to hold on to your souls you got to find items you got to get
[18481.94s -> 18488.44s]  good you could lose shit if you don't if you're not careful where's the next bonfire I don't know be
[18488.44s -> 18493.80s]  careful up that cliff yeah and you goofied off the edge motherfucker what are you doing
[18494.36s -> 18509.37s]  what have you done now you lost everything I didn't mean to call you up and a mother effort
[18509.37s -> 18532.73s]  by the way slipped out you were a cartoon no I just act like one on TV I'm kind of this is going
[18532.73s -> 18547.22s]  pretty well defense I feel like the defense play is what's gonna work here because even if I get
[18547.30s -> 18560.62s]  hit it won't kill me see what happens people said you act like one in real life too oh I mean I
[18560.62s -> 18568.66s]  mess around a lot I mean I think everybody you know when you're around like your friends and
[18568.66s -> 18593.82s]  stuff you kind of just you act like goofy and shit just for fun the magnet oh are you comfortable
[18593.82s -> 18602.95s]  here I think that's why I act the way that I act on stream because it is just like I I feel fine
[18602.95s -> 18620.89s]  I'm feeling cool here well the well the well ooh but what do I deposit I'm coming I guys I just
[18621.61s -> 18630.66s]  I you can't shut me up I'm I just keep I'll talk as long as I'm allowed to don't ever give me
[18630.66s -> 18635.80s]  have I ever go to like a parent teacher conference I will just sit up there with the microphone and
[18635.80s -> 18648.06s]  talk about Diablo 2 items as the parent or the teacher I mean just like in general like that as
[18648.06s -> 18652.46s]  like the parent like oh I'm here to just we're here to because uh the school assemblies we're
[18652.46s -> 18657.54s]  going to hear what they're going to be this year and here's here's the conference where we're going
[18657.54s -> 18667.27s]  to go over like what the students have been doing recently and no I'll I'll just I'll I'll I'll fake
[18667.27s -> 18682.57s]  an illness to not go to them you're going to be dead in a minute um I got two minutes whose dad
[18682.57s -> 18691.88s]  is this yeah we're really excited for the next season of the of the school baseball team uh I
[18691.88s -> 18698.04s]  really was curious this year are we going to be able to have uh are the gloves going to be provided
[18698.04s -> 18703.75s]  or we're going to have to get that as parents hey by the way gloves speaking of gloves I think
[18703.75s -> 18708.39s]  that you should be able to put charge bolt on something besides glove I think you should be
[18708.39s -> 18715.35s]  able to put them on uh let's say for instance cleats uh boots I think that would be it would
[18715.35s -> 18724.49s]  be interesting I think where's my kid your kid's not here this is the parent teacher conference
[18724.49s -> 18732.18s]  oh right anyways Diablo 4 is not good Diablo 2 is the real game and then and then you hear somebody
[18732.18s -> 18748.57s]  somebody starts clapping because one person cares about this well oh shit the well okay okay okay
[18748.57s -> 18772.38s]  okay I'm good I'm good I'm sure I have a cartoon character remember oh shit oh shit what am I
[18772.38s -> 18789.75s]  depositing probably the I don't know the boots seems not that great well that was exactly what
[18789.75s -> 18810.07s]  I wanted to get badly how far away is this I'm not even gonna be able to get there oh
[18810.07s -> 18831.10s]  shit I'm in trouble okay what am I putting in wind crown is just useful for a ton of people
[18831.10s -> 18892.76s]  it just is this is really fun but this is useful this is the one those defense points really did
[18892.76s -> 19009.43s]  come in handy damn all right I got uh-oh that's not what I wanted to do what's he doing why is
[19009.43s -> 19023.02s]  he being so weird what's he doing he's like trying to grab he's trying to grab me I got it
[19023.02s -> 19030.25s]  collect a total of 20 000 golds gradually survive the halls of torment and I picked up something
[19030.25s -> 19059.10s]  so what did I get ability radiant aura money money activity and accuracy money painful incision
[19059.10s -> 19076.81s]  upgrade money false blessing trait money revives that's a great thing to unlock money gold gets
[19076.81s -> 19090.62s]  brewed in barrels and then there's the wraith warlord and grand well this character is amazing
[19090.62s -> 19114.79s]  what does it let me see revives yeah five grand cool these are all very expensive that I unlock
[19114.79s -> 19127.19s]  a new zone all right there's a boss here too but I don't know if I'm gonna get there today actually
[19127.19s -> 19137.18s]  buy the wind crown yeah do I buy the wind crown or do I buy this and have the fire character be
[19137.18s -> 19155.75s]  very good this is good for everybody though yeah everybody can use that there's only one character
[19155.75s -> 19179.11s]  that really can use this 500 000 damage with a lightning strike 500 000 in one go a lot of
[19179.11s -> 19185.10s]  unlockables this is I like this game reach level 100 I feel like you have to have pretty much
[19185.10s -> 19190.92s]  everything unlocked we could probably call it here too it's been like five and a half hours I think
[19190.92s -> 19200.07s]  that's a good place to stop this is great the beta is tomorrow I think and they're adding a bunch of
[19200.07s -> 19207.72s]  stuff so maybe I'll do another killout stream in the next couple days I do want to I want to open
[19207.72s -> 19221.98s]  some tf2 crates too probably maybe Wednesday this week middle of the week Wednesday around
[19221.98s -> 19226.84s]  probably on the same time like five or six keep it at six pacific because I can always pull it back
[19226.84s -> 19233.85s]  like 30 40 minutes if I need to on Wednesday might play some more of this might play a little tf2
[19233.85s -> 19254.15s]  open up some tf2 boxes see you on Sunday no no I'll be live on Wednesday I'll see you Wednesday
[19254.15s -> 19266.71s]  more team fortress Wednesday 6 p.m pacific d2 remastered if I play d2 remastered and I start a
[19266.71s -> 19274.30s]  new character and you guys pick the build that's actually going to end up being a like seven to
[19274.30s -> 19291.90s]  eight o'clock pacific we just we turn it down and just hang out and just play show off your characters
[19291.90s -> 19307.59s]  uh we'll look at this exterminator swordsman archer what about yakuza I want to I want to get my fill
[19307.59s -> 19313.93s]  of this especially if they're going to update it tomorrow so we'll probably this sounds so
[19314.81s -> 19324.15s]  outrageous to say but I'm gonna say it we're gonna open tf2 boxes for like a half an hour
[19324.15s -> 19328.74s]  I might play like a round or two maybe I'll hang out and play some tf2 for like an hour
[19328.74s -> 19333.21s]  and then I'm gonna play this so I'm gonna open up boxes for the first part of the stream that
[19333.21s -> 19349.34s]  feels odd to say that sounds outrageous not too many I just have a ton of crates and cases over
[19349.34s -> 19356.50s]  the last 10 years that I never opened and I just kind of want to open them I've given my tf2 backpack
[19356.50s -> 19368.84s]  away like three or four times maybe I'll get something cool probably like 20 boxes maybe like
[19368.84s -> 19378.31s]  15 to 25 I don't want to go overboard but just enough to you know have a little bit of fun 100
[19378.95s -> 19392.36s]  no 250 I don't even know if I have 50 boxes to open I think I have like 30 or 40 and I don't
[19392.36s -> 19397.78s]  think I want to open some of them some of them are some old crates that I don't even know what's
[19397.78s -> 19407.78s]  really in them all right is series 90 91 and 92 crates any good I have a lot of 89 90 and 91
[19407.78s -> 19428.81s]  are those any good don't open crates open cases there are no good tf2 crates not anymore really
[19428.81s -> 19433.53s]  you said you once said that you would rather have every hair on your body removed with tweezers
[19433.53s -> 19448.30s]  rather than open crates on stream I did well no I said that that's not how long ago how long ago
[19448.30s -> 19460.28s]  though more was it more than five years was it like 10 years ago link the clip I've been I've
[19460.28s -> 19465.05s]  been doing this for too long you guys just have every audio every piece of audio I've said for
[19465.05s -> 19472.82s]  13 years you just have it I don't remember what I said 11 years ago all right so I saw so 10
[19472.82s -> 19481.40s]  years ago I said I would remove every hair in my body with tweezers if I did it or I whatever you
[19481.40s -> 19488.04s]  said it an hour ago I don't remember you saying that you can't seriously expect my client to
[19488.04s -> 19499.29s]  perjure himself over a conversation from 12 years ago that's right do it now or we unfollow
[19499.29s -> 19514.89s]  I'm doing it on Wednesday hey relax it was on the streamer simulator stream from about two years ago
[19514.89s -> 19525.38s]  well things have changed I've changed right things have changed a little I've changed
[19525.38s -> 19531.99s]  I'm willing to open up 15 to 20 crates in team fortress without removing all of the hair on my
[19531.99s -> 19548.87s]  body it's changed it's been two years has it really only been two years yeah I okay post 35
[19548.87s -> 19555.48s]  I can't be like ah you know I was yeah I was like 20s I said that I didn't that was literally like
[19555.48s -> 19569.83s]  I was I was over 35 when I said that but we're still doing it so you've massively mellowed out
[19569.83s -> 19577.85s]  I think that's just kind of natural though I told you guys this the beginning of the year
[19577.85s -> 19587.26s]  I mean it's that I've gotten I've when I started doing YouTube videos I was 25 26 that's when I
[19587.26s -> 19597.29s]  started that's like the the team fortress to YouTube videos I've gone through my 20s
[19598.25s -> 19606.98s]  into my late 30s it's just natural you're just going through the uh the natural order of you
[19606.98s -> 19614.98s]  know dialing it back a little that doesn't mean I still can't have a bunch of fun I can still move
[19614.98s -> 19627.11s]  how about that one oh my arm uh-oh oh boy that's uh that's a blown out elbow that's a blown out
[19627.11s -> 19637.72s]  elbow yeah I'll see you guys on Wednesday thanks for watching thanks for hanging out
[19637.72s -> 19664.86s]  you should have played a loud bone cracking sound do it again what about the la la la la there you
[19664.86s -> 19673.62s]  go I'm not doing that ever again unless somebody says it as a one guy and I read it I do it
[19673.62s -> 19689.54s]  immediately following reading it so I'm never doing that again yeah that this is fun I like
[19689.54s -> 19696.60s]  kind of adding to that it is nice to just kind of relax a little bit I know a lot of people are
[19696.60s -> 19703.27s]  really used to this channel being kind of like crazy I think it really is for the best to do more
[19703.27s -> 19713.54s]  of this yeah I definitely don't want to just only have it be just wacky crazy shit that's very
[19713.54s -> 19724.38s]  unsustainable if you want me to be completely realistic this one was still kind of wacky it
[19724.38s -> 19737.34s]  can be wacky but dialed down a few notches you know what I mean do you prefer this or vampire
[19737.34s -> 19746.90s]  survivors they're both very very good uh vampire survivors has way more content we like the chill
[19746.90s -> 19760.04s]  streams I do too I like them both you can eat pizza but then you can also eat steak and cheese
[19760.04s -> 19772.68s]  sandwiches too they both exist what's something that's too wacky um I don't know it's just the
[19772.68s -> 19784.20s]  vibes when the vibes are wacky it's fun it's also nice to kind of just not do that just relax and
[19784.20s -> 19787.96s]  chill and play games and just talk about stuff it's the vibes with the bat chest exactly you know
[19787.96s -> 19799.34s]  exactly what I'm talking about thank you for watching to see you all on Wednesday thanks a lot
