[2.10s -> 23.88s]  Hello. Hey guys, welcome to stream. Welcome to my first ever stream. I've been waiting to try something like that. I don't know. I got a headache. That's why I'm doing this.
[23.88s -> 36.43s]  Oh, he's doing the Sans voice. Hey guys, how are you? Hold on. Hold on a second here. Yeah, sorry we're starting a lot later than usual.
[36.43s -> 50.21s]  But the reason for that... Ooh, let me move you over here. The reason for that is I woke up this morning and just had a really annoying headache.
[50.21s -> 54.21s]  It didn't really hurt that much, but it was just... it just was there. It just wouldn't go away.
[54.21s -> 64.26s]  It was a pressure headache, so it was just messing with my ability to talk and think and like right in the front of my forehead, you know what I mean?
[64.26s -> 80.74s]  It's called a hangover? I didn't drink anything last night. What? The last time I drank is on this stream. Like last week.
[80.74s -> 88.74s]  I only drink... I really only drink probably like two or three times a month. Maybe. If that.
[88.74s -> 107.21s]  Shoot, what do you mean sure? Every time I drink, you guys see it. Boxed wine? Yeah, but I was building a labo for that. I had to do that.
[107.21s -> 121.97s]  What about that time that I drank toilet water? Well, I mean, I didn't drink actual toilet water. I was drinking water out of a sink.
[121.97s -> 131.19s]  But tonight, I'll give you a rundown of what we're doing here. So tonight and possibly tomorrow, we're going to stream two days in a row.
[131.19s -> 139.37s]  So Katamari Damacy Reroll, the remake remastering of the original Katamari game just came out.
[139.37s -> 148.89s]  So obviously that was one of my favorite games ever. And what are we even waiting for here? You know what I'm saying?
[148.89s -> 165.34s]  What are we even waiting for? Here it is. All the original music, all the original levels. I played this game as shit.
[165.34s -> 171.70s]  This is my childhood. And here's the thing, those of you guys who don't know what the fucking title means, sing it with me.
[171.70s -> 176.70s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[176.70s -> 204.07s]  Ruined. All right. All right. All right. You know what we're doing. Yeah, this is my childhood, guys.
[204.07s -> 214.68s]  When I grew up, I was probably, I don't know, maybe like probably 20, 22 when this game came out, 23 maybe.
[214.68s -> 228.94s]  And yeah, I grew up with it. I was just a kid. I remember riding my bike around the neighborhood, hanging out with the neighborhood kids.
[228.94s -> 236.74s]  I had a backwards ball cap on, a cool vest with Marty McFly on it. I was like 24.
[236.74s -> 255.70s]  Me and all the other like neighborhood college kids, you know what I mean?
[255.70s -> 271.49s]  Well, how old, what, when do you guys think that you get old? I'm just barely right now. I'm barely like turning into, I'm barely an adult.
[271.49s -> 282.38s]  You don't really become an adult till you're like 38. I'm not there yet. I'm still just a kid.
[282.38s -> 291.55s]  I saw the song from the TV commercials and they told me when I was younger, this is not my fault.
[291.55s -> 298.62s]  Okay. Blame Toys R Us because I don't want to grow up on the Toys R Us kid was what was on TV every fucking day.
[298.62s -> 303.62s]  And they they were brainwashing me to say, don't ever be an adult. Don't be an adult. Be a kid forever.
[303.62s -> 319.85s]  And I'm like, fuck, man. All right. I guess you barely become an adult when you're 30. I'm just kidding.
[319.85s -> 326.60s]  But we're going to play Katamari tonight and tomorrow. And then we're going to take a day off on what is today.
[326.60s -> 332.90s]  So Monday, Tuesday, we'll take we'll take Wednesday off and maybe Thursday because Friday is going to be the Birdhouse stream.
[332.90s -> 348.78s]  I'm building a birdhouse. Why don't we just listen to it again? No, we don't need to see it again.
[348.78s -> 356.34s]  Turn it up louder. Here it comes again. What if I just did this for like three hours?
[356.34s -> 363.78s]  Do you agree to these terms and conditions? They weren't terms and conditions in the original game.
[363.78s -> 372.15s]  This is like, this is absolutely a remake. Privacy policy. Didn't have to agree to this shit last time.
[373.15s -> 380.58s]  There he is. Hello, Prince. This is the King. Long time no see.
[380.58s -> 386.58s]  We thought today would be a good day for rolling the Katamari. The Prince.
[386.58s -> 391.58s]  You want me to read this correctly?
[391.58s -> 401.15s]  Where the first rolls, the second follows. Roll, roll, roll.
[402.15s -> 409.39s]  For that purpose, all alone, we went to the bother, the bother of making this space.
[409.39s -> 415.53s]  The King of all cosmos going to the bother. Just for, I can't read this.
[415.53s -> 419.53s]  It's like too fucking cryptic and all over the place.
[419.53s -> 433.20s]  We went to the bother. They would like for you to start the rolling.
[433.20s -> 439.30s]  But, but, first things first.
[439.30s -> 447.30s]  But, first things first. Does the Prince like vibration?
[447.30s -> 451.30s]  Meaning the moving and the shaking.
[451.30s -> 455.57s]  No, no, no, no. I hate it.
[455.57s -> 460.57s]  Plane is best. I love going on natural.
[460.57s -> 466.51s]  If that's what you say, what you declare.
[466.51s -> 473.51s]  Then you can turn the vibration on and off with the...
[473.51s -> 482.41s]  All clear, good. We shall see you later.
[482.41s -> 488.03s]  That's slower than I remember. Did the text come on screen that slowly before?
[488.03s -> 490.03s]  This is a remake.
[490.03s -> 495.10s]  All right, Katamari. If you don't know what Katamari is, it's a game where you roll around a little
[495.10s -> 502.10s]  never-lasting gobstopper and you have to pick up shit. It sticks to the ball as a sticky ball.
[502.10s -> 510.16s]  You use the analogs to turn around, back and forward. You have to roll over everything, pick up stuff.
[510.16s -> 514.16s]  And you got to make your Katamari huge or as big as the King desires.
[514.16s -> 520.30s]  Vibration on? I'm not going to put vibration on. I hate vibration. I'm with the King on this one.
[520.30s -> 525.39s]  Vibration sucks.
[525.39s -> 531.39s]  It's a feature that we somehow put on all consoles after its intended purpose was used and done.
[531.39s -> 534.76s]  You guys, listen.
[534.76s -> 539.76s]  Rumble was the VR from like 1993.
[539.76s -> 547.00s]  Well, I'm in the game. Oh, my car just got hit. Whoa, my hands. It was revolutionary. It was insane.
[547.00s -> 551.07s]  It's not necessary anymore.
[551.07s -> 556.85s]  Dazzling. We feel a swoon coming over.
[561.05s -> 568.05s]  Vibration? Yeah, it was a peripheral you had to attach to the back of your controller.
[568.05s -> 574.68s]  Phones have vibration too, Boomer.
[574.68s -> 580.68s]  Yeah, but your phone vibrates to alert you of something. It doesn't vibrate so you're not like walking around
[580.68s -> 584.68s]  and each step the phone vibrates to pretend like you're walking around somewhere.
[584.68s -> 588.68s]  Like, oh, dude, this is pretty, this is pretty, uh, ooh, I can feel, I'm walking.
[588.68s -> 592.68s]  I actually am because I vibrate every single time I step. I know I'm walking.
[592.68s -> 607.90s]  Did somebody just say turn off the music? Wait.
[607.90s -> 610.90s]  That's like one of the best parts of the whole game.
[610.90s -> 613.90s]  Please turn off the music.
[613.90s -> 616.90s]  Look is L.
[623.41s -> 625.41s]  R is jump.
[625.41s -> 630.53s]  Okay, quick turn is...
[632.53s -> 635.53s]  Okay, so you gotta go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[635.53s -> 639.53s]  Let's just charge and roll. Click it to spin around.
[639.53s -> 642.53s]  Very useful and they're using this a lot.
[642.53s -> 649.65s]  Don't turn it off, beatbox to the scratches.
[649.65s -> 654.73s]  I've mastered the controls.
[656.73s -> 664.96s]  If you've actually never played this game before, it really is like a wonderful experience.
[664.96s -> 667.96s]  That's why we're doing it on stream.
[667.96s -> 677.90s]  You wanna talk about like a DLC character for Smash?
[677.90s -> 680.90s]  Don't put Sora in the fucking game.
[680.90s -> 694.53s]  Everyone's like, oh, Sora for DLC? No, put the king of the cosmos in the game.
[694.53s -> 698.50s]  What a great character that would be.
[698.50s -> 704.53s]  It's indeed not a dream. We really didn't. The king of all cosmos has really done it.
[704.53s -> 706.53s]  A sky full of stars.
[706.53s -> 711.52s]  We broke it.
[711.52s -> 714.52s]  Yes, we were naughty, completely naughty.
[714.52s -> 717.52s]  So, so, so very sorry.
[717.52s -> 722.14s]  But just between you and us, it feels quite good.
[722.14s -> 727.60s]  Not that we can remember very clearly, but we were in all nature's embrace.
[727.60s -> 732.61s]  We felt the beauty of all things and felt love for all. That's how it was.
[732.61s -> 736.62s]  Did you see? We smiled a genuine smile. Did you see it?
[736.62s -> 740.88s]  The stars splintering in perfect beauty.
[740.88s -> 745.88s]  So many, there used to be almost a nuisance, but there's nothing but darkness.
[745.88s -> 749.25s]  He. E. He. It is but a dream. E. He.
[749.25s -> 751.25s]  But a beautiful one.
[751.25s -> 755.06s]  B. But. Beauty.
[756.37s -> 760.86s]  That miraculous, fabulous moment has passed. It's over.
[760.86s -> 763.86s]  We came to and found everyone furious.
[763.86s -> 767.86s]  Even the king of all cosmos was not spared their wrath. Really, everybody was irate.
[767.86s -> 771.41s]  Anyway, Pee Wee Prince.
[771.41s -> 775.78s]  Hurry up and bring back the glorious starry sky.
[775.78s -> 778.78s]  Our problem, your problem. Yeah, you owe us your existence.
[778.78s -> 784.05s]  We collect on the debt. Pee Wee German.
[784.05s -> 788.05s]  Hand in hand, always there. Yes, the very definition of the father-son bond.
[788.05s -> 794.66s]  Alright then, let's get cracking. Sending things to Earth.
[794.66s -> 805.38s]  The Prince is already in Smash. What? Really?
[805.38s -> 811.59s]  But not the king of the cosmos.
[811.59s -> 814.59s]  Here we are, Earth. This is the game. Full of things as usual.
[814.59s -> 819.05s]  So, so small, you're as small as ever.
[819.05s -> 823.05s]  We didn't notice not one jot with what the stars at all.
[823.05s -> 827.05s]  What is that? That body? That physique? Could you really be our son?
[827.05s -> 830.59s]  E. He. I've got it.
[830.59s -> 833.59s]  Build yourself up while you roll the Katamari. Work out and get bigger.
[833.59s -> 836.59s]  Yes indeed.
[836.59s -> 840.59s]  Don't presume to take the escalator up to the throne just because you're the Prince.
[840.59s -> 843.59s]  Wow. Tangent. Wild tangent.
[843.59s -> 846.59s]  We didn't go there last time, but that's alright.
[846.59s -> 849.59s]  First time on Earth means no worrying about time.
[849.59s -> 853.59s]  We think we'll come and pick you up when that Katamari is ten centimeters.
[853.59s -> 857.59s]  Just remember, many things live here, scurrying around and generally getting in the way.
[857.59s -> 862.59s]  When one of these sneaks up behind you, an alert comes up on the lower left.
[862.59s -> 866.59s]  I love this name. Try not to bump into anything alive.
[866.59s -> 871.59s]  But don't worry about it too much. It won't end the game or anything, so just relax and roll.
[871.59s -> 874.59s]  Good luck, inchling Prince.
[874.59s -> 877.59s]  So, there we go, here we go.
[877.59s -> 881.59s]  The best part. Ooh, that same thing.
[881.59s -> 886.59s]  This was the very first thing we ever rolled up.
[886.59s -> 888.59s]  This dice.
[888.59s -> 891.59s]  Oh, we feel a little emotional.
[891.59s -> 895.15s]  We should put this in the diary.
[895.15s -> 904.26s]  Oh, I bumped into the snail.
[904.26s -> 909.77s]  I'm going to get the blocks of cheese.
[909.77s -> 911.77s]  Oh, it's all coming back to me, the memories.
[911.77s -> 914.71s]  Get the sandwiches. Oh!
[914.71s -> 918.85s]  You guys know the Reddit subreddit, like, oddly satisfying?
[918.85s -> 923.56s]  They actually got all their inspiration from this game.
[923.56s -> 927.56s]  This whole game is just one giant, oddly satisfying Reddit thread.
[927.56s -> 937.26s]  Just inherently satisfying. What about the cell phones?
[937.26s -> 940.13s]  No, not big enough for those yet.
[940.13s -> 942.13s]  Not big enough for the cell phones.
[942.13s -> 951.02s]  The phone text hurt. Get the jello.
[951.02s -> 954.58s]  Ah, what? It's alive?
[954.58s -> 960.58s]  The same thing. This was the very first thing we ever collided with.
[960.58s -> 968.42s]  Why can I not pick up the little mounds of jelly?
[968.42s -> 970.36s]  I'm just nailing it.
[970.36s -> 975.29s]  Let's make it roll fast.
[975.29s -> 977.29s]  Almost there. Ten centimeters and that's it.
[977.29s -> 987.00s]  Get the blocks.
[987.00s -> 991.00s]  Eventually you can pick up the biggest stuff in the hole in the room on Earth.
[991.00s -> 994.39s]  How goes it?
[994.39s -> 996.39s]  How was Earth, huh?
[996.39s -> 999.39s]  We made a ten centimeter Katamari. How fabulous.
[999.39s -> 1003.39s]  We'd forgotten all about that, so you're mostly clearing everything else we see.
[1003.39s -> 1006.70s]  Everyone on Earth is very nice, so they'll be very helpful.
[1006.70s -> 1010.70s]  They'll let you roll everything up with a smile, yes, possibly also a wave.
[1010.70s -> 1021.60s]  Anyway, let's go home for now.
[1021.60s -> 1023.60s]  Oh yes, I almost forgot. Completely slipped the mind.
[1023.60s -> 1027.60s]  When rolling on Earth, there are a few more things to be careful of.
[1027.60s -> 1031.84s]  You cannot roll up objects larger than your Katamari.
[1031.84s -> 1035.84s]  Scratching into larger objects and walls will break things of the Katamari and reduce its size.
[1035.84s -> 1037.84s]  Things fall off.
[1037.84s -> 1041.84s]  Oddly shaped objects will make your Katamari lopsided.
[1041.84s -> 1043.84s]  And fuck it all up.
[1043.84s -> 1046.98s]  What? No.
[1046.98s -> 1051.58s]  Loud game.
[1051.58s -> 1058.48s]  There, is that better?
[1058.48s -> 1060.48s]  I'm not doing the... I know how to play the game.
[1060.48s -> 1063.98s]  It was the first goal, but it's not the very exciting one, is it?
[1063.98s -> 1068.05s]  Next time, we want a much bigger one.
[1068.05s -> 1071.05s]  The thing that you collected the most of is...
[1071.05s -> 1074.05s]  Snacks, stationery, and games.
[1074.05s -> 1076.54s]  My Earth is really full of things.
[1076.54s -> 1078.54s]  We will now release it into the sky.
[1078.54s -> 1083.58s]  Yeah, you're essentially making stars for the cosmos.
[1083.58s -> 1091.22s]  Ten centimeters, one millimeter.
[1091.22s -> 1094.22s]  Here's the menu. You forgot your own planet.
[1094.22s -> 1099.93s]  Really, are you serious? So you're just not just small, but a bit slow too.
[1099.93s -> 1103.23s]  I can already see the clips that are coming out from this.
[1103.23s -> 1104.23s]  You know?
[1104.23s -> 1108.54s]  Like, how many clips have been done in the stream so far?
[1108.54s -> 1112.80s]  You guys have already clipped 13 things in the tutorial.
[1112.80s -> 1119.11s]  We cannot feel but partly responsible.
[1119.11s -> 1122.12s]  Sai, this is your home planet.
[1122.12s -> 1124.12s]  The planet where you live.
[1124.12s -> 1127.36s]  Here you can look at stars and save the game and do lots of other things.
[1127.36s -> 1130.36s]  You can even visit Earth and the space mushroom.
[1130.36s -> 1133.36s]  Just by pressing the L and R button.
[1133.36s -> 1138.66s]  Roll your Katamari around on Earth, visit the space mushroom to complete against your cousins.
[1138.66s -> 1141.66s]  And that's about it. Your smallness to get a grip.
[1141.66s -> 1143.66s]  Oh, there's another clip!
[1143.66s -> 1144.66s]  Your absent-mindedness.
[1144.66s -> 1145.66s]  There's another one!
[1145.66s -> 1150.85s]  All right, make sure to save.
[1150.85s -> 1151.85s]  Make sure you remind me to do that.
[1151.85s -> 1156.97s]  All right, let's save the game right now.
[1156.97s -> 1162.22s]  So you guys want the music up or the sound down?
[1162.22s -> 1167.19s]  How does that sound?
[1167.19s -> 1169.19s]  Is that more tolerable for your ears?
[1169.19s -> 1172.66s]  Maybe?
[1172.66s -> 1173.66s]  Uh, data.
[1173.66s -> 1174.66s]  Collection.
[1174.66s -> 1176.47s]  Control, config.
[1176.47s -> 1179.66s]  Presence.
[1179.66s -> 1180.66s]  View, constellations.
[1180.66s -> 1182.66s]  All right, let me go save it.
[1182.66s -> 1186.01s]  Select a file.
[1186.01s -> 1190.49s]  Uh, how about right in the middle?
[1190.49s -> 1191.92s]  Louder.
[1191.92s -> 1192.92s]  Not louder.
[1192.92s -> 1198.36s]  No, don't quit the game.
[1198.36s -> 1200.36s]  So, is there anything else I can do in here?
[1200.36s -> 1206.33s]  I remember somebody was saying that the graphic settings are actually somehow in here.
[1206.33s -> 1207.33s]  But I'm playing on the Switch.
[1207.33s -> 1209.33s]  I don't think there are any graphic settings.
[1209.33s -> 1214.69s]  All right, let's go.
[1214.69s -> 1217.12s]  So, let's take a look at the map.
[1217.12s -> 1219.42s]  We've got this one.
[1219.42s -> 1221.42s]  This is, uh, our first ever roll.
[1221.42s -> 1224.43s]  It's Castella.
[1224.43s -> 1227.43s]  And I think now it's time to go to Earth.
[1227.43s -> 1233.51s]  Here's your world map.
[1233.51s -> 1234.51s]  Make a star 2.
[1234.51s -> 1236.51s]  Make a star 1.
[1236.51s -> 1237.51s]  Here's the second level.
[1237.51s -> 1240.39s]  Make a star 2.
[1249.59s -> 1251.92s]  What's this?
[1251.92s -> 1252.92s]  I wish I could play the piano.
[1252.92s -> 1256.92s]  I would put it on, like, the weird dum-dum chorus thing and just play all day.
[1256.92s -> 1264.15s]  Because this is just a keyboard with a setting on it.
[1264.15s -> 1269.49s]  All right.
[1269.49s -> 1272.65s]  Um.
[1272.65s -> 1276.64s]  Dang, dang, dang.
[1276.64s -> 1277.64s]  Have you ever been to the Philippines?
[1277.64s -> 1279.64s]  We stopped in the day before yesterday.
[1279.64s -> 1286.03s]  We hope you can visit during the day's rolling like that's possible.
[1286.03s -> 1288.34s]  Oh, yes.
[1288.34s -> 1291.58s]  A royal present for the hard-working prince.
[1291.58s -> 1292.58s]  That's what we were thinking.
[1292.58s -> 1295.58s]  While playing catch with your present.
[1295.58s -> 1296.58s]  And it went down to Earth.
[1296.58s -> 1298.58s]  It just fell to Earth.
[1298.58s -> 1302.14s]  Must be around somewhere, so roll it up while you're at it.
[1302.14s -> 1305.49s]  Sending things to Earth.
[1305.49s -> 1310.91s]  Movies.
[1310.91s -> 1311.91s]  Programs.
[1311.91s -> 1312.91s]  Elephants.
[1312.91s -> 1313.91s]  Giraffes.
[1313.91s -> 1314.91s]  Sheep.
[1314.91s -> 1316.09s]  Alligators.
[1316.09s -> 1319.61s]  Here we are.
[1319.61s -> 1321.61s]  Today you'll be rolling inside the house.
[1321.61s -> 1326.04s]  The catamari should be, let's see, around a full 20 centimeters.
[1326.04s -> 1329.22s]  We can believe in you for seven minutes.
[1329.22s -> 1331.22s]  This is the amount of time you have to do it.
[1331.22s -> 1336.52s]  But any longer than that, and even the king of all cosmos can't be expected to wait.
[1336.52s -> 1340.53s]  We look forward to a nice catamari, mini prince.
[1340.53s -> 1342.53s]  Look at the little rats with the cheese balls.
[1342.53s -> 1344.54s]  Here we go.
[1344.54s -> 1347.63s]  Why did it, come on.
[1347.63s -> 1350.63s]  I'm trying to like do like an interesting intro to the game.
[1350.63s -> 1355.33s]  Can't get these.
[1355.33s -> 1356.33s]  Oh, I can.
[1356.33s -> 1357.33s]  I can get the toothpaste.
[1357.33s -> 1362.77s]  Got to get the small shit first.
[1362.77s -> 1364.07s]  Taffy.
[1364.07s -> 1365.07s]  Get the candy.
[1365.07s -> 1367.21s]  I can't get the taffy yet.
[1367.21s -> 1369.64s]  Not for the love of God, really.
[1369.64s -> 1373.89s]  No orange slices?
[1373.89s -> 1374.89s]  Not big enough.
[1374.89s -> 1379.62s]  I can get the little marbles.
[1379.62s -> 1384.26s]  What about these?
[1384.26s -> 1385.26s]  Fuck.
[1385.26s -> 1386.26s]  Come on.
[1386.26s -> 1387.26s]  Nail polish.
[1387.26s -> 1388.62s]  No.
[1388.62s -> 1389.62s]  Matchsticks.
[1389.62s -> 1391.80s]  I have to get bigger.
[1391.80s -> 1395.54s]  Get up.
[1395.54s -> 1397.93s]  There we go.
[1397.93s -> 1398.93s]  Okay.
[1398.93s -> 1399.93s]  Take your own.
[1399.93s -> 1402.42s]  Now it's time to roll over everything here.
[1402.42s -> 1404.73s]  I'm going to take out the Legos.
[1404.73s -> 1406.73s]  And the chocolate cookies.
[1406.73s -> 1409.76s]  Can't get the big ones.
[1409.76s -> 1412.02s]  Was it one?
[1412.02s -> 1413.02s]  20?
[1413.02s -> 1414.02s]  20 centimeters?
[1414.02s -> 1417.50s]  Oh.
[1417.50s -> 1421.30s]  Okay.
[1421.30s -> 1422.30s]  I can get the nail polish.
[1422.30s -> 1424.49s]  I'm going to go up.
[1426.62s -> 1428.62s]  We did not go up at all.
[1428.62s -> 1429.62s]  No!
[1429.62s -> 1430.62s]  I fell off.
[1430.62s -> 1431.62s]  Shit.
[1431.62s -> 1432.62s]  This momentum.
[1432.62s -> 1433.62s]  It's all right.
[1433.62s -> 1434.62s]  I got six minutes.
[1434.62s -> 1442.33s]  Careful.
[1442.33s -> 1443.33s]  Careful.
[1443.33s -> 1445.02s]  All right.
[1445.02s -> 1446.02s]  There's a game board here.
[1446.02s -> 1449.05s]  What's going on?
[1449.05s -> 1451.31s]  Hmm.
[1451.31s -> 1452.31s]  Ten centimeters.
[1452.31s -> 1453.31s]  Just get it bigger.
[1453.31s -> 1456.47s]  I know.
[1456.47s -> 1457.47s]  I know I'm going to do 20.
[1457.47s -> 1458.47s]  What do you think I'm doing?
[1458.47s -> 1459.47s]  I can get the candy.
[1459.47s -> 1462.38s]  Oh, I can get the tapes.
[1462.38s -> 1465.98s]  These things are huge.
[1465.98s -> 1466.98s]  Get them.
[1466.98s -> 1469.98s]  All of them.
[1469.98s -> 1470.98s]  Every single birthday tape.
[1470.98s -> 1471.98s]  Get it.
[1471.98s -> 1472.98s]  Oh, my God.
[1472.98s -> 1478.83s]  I just ruined everything.
[1478.83s -> 1480.65s]  I'm going to go up here.
[1480.65s -> 1481.65s]  Pick up the entire breakfast.
[1481.65s -> 1482.65s]  House of cards?
[1482.65s -> 1483.65s]  No!
[1483.65s -> 1484.65s]  I fell off.
[1484.65s -> 1485.65s]  Shit.
[1485.65s -> 1486.82s]  Oh.
[1486.82s -> 1487.82s]  No.
[1487.82s -> 1489.96s]  That was about to be so satisfying.
[1489.96s -> 1490.96s]  Get me up there.
[1490.96s -> 1492.20s]  Come on, man.
[1492.20s -> 1493.20s]  Ah.
[1493.20s -> 1494.20s]  I can go to sleep tonight.
[1494.20s -> 1495.20s]  Okay.
[1495.20s -> 1496.20s]  Good.
[1496.20s -> 1497.20s]  Reset.
[1497.20s -> 1498.20s]  What am I bumping into?
[1498.20s -> 1499.20s]  Frogs?
[1499.20s -> 1502.62s]  Oh.
[1502.62s -> 1503.62s]  Oh.
[1503.62s -> 1504.92s]  Oh.
[1504.92s -> 1506.61s]  Oh.
[1506.61s -> 1507.61s]  Oh.
[1507.61s -> 1508.61s]  Oh.
[1508.61s -> 1515.48s]  Oh.
[1515.48s -> 1517.23s]  Oh.
[1517.23s -> 1518.23s]  Oh.
[1518.23s -> 1519.73s]  Oh.
[1519.73s -> 1524.36s]  Frogs?
[1524.36s -> 1525.36s]  Come on.
[1525.36s -> 1526.36s]  I can still pick shit up up here.
[1526.36s -> 1528.56s]  Oh.
[1528.56s -> 1529.56s]  Watch out.
[1529.56s -> 1530.56s]  I'm not going to get out.
[1530.56s -> 1532.82s]  I don't know why I think that's funny now.
[1532.82s -> 1537.78s]  Anything in the bathroom?
[1537.78s -> 1538.78s]  Oh, mousetraps.
[1538.78s -> 1540.02s]  I'm getting hit by the mousetraps.
[1540.02s -> 1544.14s]  Right here.
[1544.14s -> 1545.14s]  Racer's got them.
[1545.14s -> 1553.48s]  All right.
[1553.48s -> 1554.48s]  I'm good.
[1554.48s -> 1556.74s]  Anything else over here that I didn't get?
[1556.74s -> 1567.14s]  Can I get the whole dinner?
[1567.14s -> 1568.14s]  Yeah, I can.
[1568.14s -> 1569.14s]  18.4.
[1569.14s -> 1570.14s]  We got it.
[1570.14s -> 1571.14s]  That's fine.
[1571.14s -> 1572.63s]  Everything's fine.
[1572.63s -> 1573.63s]  I want to get up there.
[1573.63s -> 1574.63s]  How do I jump with this?
[1574.63s -> 1575.63s]  Can you jump with this?
[1581.03s -> 1582.03s]  What is left that I didn't get?
[1582.03s -> 1584.81s]  I can't go outside.
[1584.81s -> 1585.81s]  Oh, my God.
[1585.81s -> 1586.81s]  I can go outside.
[1586.81s -> 1587.81s]  Basket of apples.
[1587.81s -> 1593.21s]  Got it.
[1593.21s -> 1594.21s]  Just jump.
[1594.21s -> 1595.21s]  Oh, what a nice tatamari.
[1595.21s -> 1596.21s]  Substantially, it goes down smoothly.
[1596.21s -> 1602.90s]  But actually, we would love to have a much bigger, nicer tatamari.
[1602.90s -> 1605.54s]  We'll leave you to your work.
[1605.54s -> 1606.54s]  All right.
[1606.54s -> 1607.54s]  I've got to get up there.
[1607.54s -> 1608.54s]  Oh.
[1608.54s -> 1610.29s]  Oh.
[1610.29s -> 1611.29s]  Oh.
[1611.29s -> 1612.29s]  Oh.
[1612.29s -> 1613.91s]  Oh.
[1613.91s -> 1614.91s]  Oh.
[1615.91s -> 1619.91s]  But actually, we would love to have a much bigger, nicer tatamari.
[1619.91s -> 1621.91s]  We'll leave you to your work.
[1621.91s -> 1622.91s]  All right.
[1622.91s -> 1623.91s]  I've got to just...
[1623.91s -> 1624.91s]  I beat it.
[1624.91s -> 1633.78s]  I just have to get as many socks as I can.
[1633.78s -> 1634.78s]  Get the knives.
[1634.78s -> 1638.92s]  I know people are going to get really upset that I didn't get every sock.
[1638.92s -> 1644.46s]  And there's going to be a lot of opportunity where you can scream at me.
[1644.46s -> 1645.46s]  Pikachu sock.
[1645.46s -> 1646.46s]  Yeah, that's what they were.
[1653.27s -> 1656.27s]  Get the sock.
[1656.27s -> 1657.70s]  All right.
[1657.70s -> 1659.70s]  Now, because I have an opportunity to, I'll get it.
[1659.70s -> 1662.03s]  It's back here, right?
[1662.03s -> 1664.42s]  Right there.
[1664.42s -> 1665.42s]  I got it.
[1665.42s -> 1668.01s]  I got it.
[1668.01s -> 1669.01s]  Everybody can relax.
[1669.01s -> 1670.01s]  I got the sock.
[1670.01s -> 1674.17s]  I'm not big enough to pick up a fence.
[1674.17s -> 1681.50s]  I love the PogChamp for picking up the sock.
[1681.50s -> 1684.60s]  Is that it?
[1684.60s -> 1685.60s]  Is that all it takes?
[1685.60s -> 1688.54s]  I just have to pick up a sock?
[1688.54s -> 1694.94s]  I'm not tall enough to get this.
[1694.94s -> 1697.44s]  Eventually, you can pick up...
[1697.44s -> 1698.44s]  I'm tiny right now.
[1698.44s -> 1700.44s]  You guys think this is the whole game right here?
[1700.44s -> 1704.51s]  Just wait until I'm as big as the buildings.
[1704.51s -> 1708.74s]  Everybody clip that one.
[1708.74s -> 1711.26s]  Oh, I got the present.
[1711.26s -> 1723.22s]  Clip list rose.
[1723.22s -> 1734.00s]  Every time he says the word tall, small, or not big enough, make sure you get like five clips in it and then string them all together.
[1734.00s -> 1735.00s]  So it's like small.
[1735.00s -> 1736.00s]  Not tall enough.
[1736.00s -> 1737.00s]  I'm small.
[1737.00s -> 1738.00s]  I'm too small.
[1738.00s -> 1739.00s]  I'm short.
[1739.00s -> 1740.00s]  I'm too short for this.
[1740.00s -> 1741.00s]  I'm too small for this.
[1741.00s -> 1742.00s]  God, not tall, short, inch.
[1742.00s -> 1743.00s]  I just gave it to you.
[1743.00s -> 1745.00s]  You don't even have to do the work.
[1745.00s -> 1747.00s]  Nobody has to even do the work now.
[1747.00s -> 1749.00s]  You just got it for free.
[1749.00s -> 1756.98s]  You don't even have to do the clip compilation.
[1756.98s -> 1759.62s]  There we go.
[1759.62s -> 1760.62s]  I can get the fence.
[1760.62s -> 1763.45s]  What?
[1763.45s -> 1764.45s]  I thought I was...
[1764.45s -> 1765.45s]  I couldn't just get the fence right there?
[1765.45s -> 1766.45s]  30 seconds.
[1766.45s -> 1775.88s]  Come on.
[1775.88s -> 1776.88s]  Fast.
[1776.88s -> 1780.87s]  Fast.
[1780.87s -> 1781.87s]  I can't make it up here.
[1781.87s -> 1783.87s]  Into the lady's face.
[1783.87s -> 1788.54s]  Steal all of the shit that's on her desk.
[1788.54s -> 1802.71s]  Time's up.
[1802.71s -> 1807.96s]  It was boring to watch this all the time.
[1807.96s -> 1812.34s]  Come on, man.
[1812.34s -> 1814.51s]  This game is really fun.
[1814.51s -> 1815.51s]  I love this game.
[1815.51s -> 1816.51s]  Let me have this.
[1816.51s -> 1824.86s]  King of the Cosmos is a chat.
[1824.86s -> 1825.86s]  34 centimeters.
[1825.86s -> 1826.86s]  It's pretty big.
[1826.86s -> 1827.86s]  We imagine it like a pretty star.
[1827.86s -> 1833.21s]  If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger.
[1833.21s -> 1835.66s]  Here.
[1835.66s -> 1836.66s]  This is our royal present.
[1836.66s -> 1837.66s]  What is it?
[1837.66s -> 1839.03s]  Guess what?
[1839.03s -> 1840.03s]  Guess what it is.
[1840.03s -> 1844.10s]  The thing that you collected the most of is stationary.
[1844.10s -> 1847.18s]  Earth is really full of things.
[1847.18s -> 1851.72s]  We will not release it into the sky.
[1851.72s -> 1864.39s]  Oh, I forgot about these little...
[1864.39s -> 1865.39s]  Wait.
[1865.39s -> 1866.63s]  Everybody quiet.
[1866.63s -> 1868.63s]  We're about to leave.
[1868.63s -> 1869.94s]  Okay.
[1869.94s -> 1874.42s]  They're watching General Robo.
[1874.42s -> 1888.99s]  There's a story here, guys.
[1888.99s -> 1890.99s]  I didn't think it was an elaborate storyline.
[1890.99s -> 1895.15s]  I want to see what the present is.
[1895.15s -> 1898.27s]  Winter scarf.
[1898.27s -> 1899.27s]  Nice.
[1899.27s -> 1905.42s]  I'm not even saving it.
[1905.42s -> 1911.15s]  Let's just fucking go wild and not even save it.
[1911.15s -> 1912.15s]  Yeah, now I have a scarf.
[1912.15s -> 1917.36s]  Let's go back to Earth.
[1917.36s -> 1919.36s]  What about the secret mushroom?
[1919.36s -> 1922.90s]  Here's all the friends.
[1922.90s -> 1923.90s]  Another cousin has arrived.
[1923.90s -> 1924.90s]  Here they are.
[1924.90s -> 1925.90s]  All right, who do I want to...
[1925.90s -> 1926.90s]  You can be...
[1926.90s -> 1927.90s]  This is a character.
[1927.90s -> 1928.90s]  Who's your character?
[1928.90s -> 1930.78s]  So let's see.
[1930.78s -> 1934.86s]  Who do I want to be?
[1934.86s -> 1937.55s]  I fucked it up.
[1937.55s -> 1940.55s]  I couldn't even get the strength to even say anything afterwards.
[1940.55s -> 1941.55s]  I was trying to do...
[1941.55s -> 1943.55s]  I was going to say, Olimar!
[1943.55s -> 1950.08s]  But I missed?
[1950.08s -> 1952.98s]  Who do I be?
[1952.98s -> 1955.98s]  I kind of like the picnic table guy.
[1955.98s -> 1965.61s]  Or Longhead.
[1965.61s -> 1969.36s]  What about this guy?
[1969.36s -> 1980.43s]  Oh, here, I was Marcy.
[1980.43s -> 1981.43s]  All right, fine.
[1981.43s -> 1985.49s]  I'm Marcy.
[1985.49s -> 1988.84s]  Come over here.
[1988.84s -> 1992.10s]  Why can't I select you?
[1992.10s -> 1995.11s]  What the hell?
[1995.11s -> 1999.68s]  Select.
[1999.68s -> 2000.86s]  Okay, got it.
[2000.86s -> 2005.17s]  No, no, select.
[2005.17s -> 2010.67s]  Can I not use usual control?
[2010.67s -> 2011.67s]  Okay, what the hell?
[2011.67s -> 2013.67s]  I can't play with Marcy?
[2013.67s -> 2017.17s]  Yeah, I'm pressing A. A's not doing anything.
[2017.17s -> 2018.86s]  Can I just...
[2018.86s -> 2022.25s]  This is for multiplayer only.
[2022.25s -> 2024.06s]  What?
[2024.06s -> 2030.08s]  I can't play as those characters?
[2030.08s -> 2031.08s]  Whatever.
[2031.08s -> 2040.18s]  Everyone just get ready for the next meteor restart.
[2040.18s -> 2042.74s]  Boatar Day.
[2042.74s -> 2044.92s]  Have you ever been to Portugal?
[2044.92s -> 2046.92s]  We were there yesterday.
[2046.92s -> 2048.92s]  We hope you can visit during the day's rolling.
[2048.92s -> 2049.92s]  Like, that's possible.
[2049.92s -> 2050.92s]  Oh, yes, I almost forgot.
[2050.92s -> 2052.29s]  Oh, yes.
[2052.29s -> 2055.29s]  A royal present for the Powered Working Prince is a present on here.
[2055.29s -> 2056.29s]  That's all I care about.
[2056.29s -> 2057.29s]  I don't even care if I fucking lose.
[2057.29s -> 2058.29s]  I don't care if I lose.
[2058.29s -> 2059.29s]  Give me the present.
[2059.29s -> 2060.29s]  That's what we were thinking.
[2060.29s -> 2062.29s]  But we sort of tossed it down to Earth.
[2062.29s -> 2067.72s]  We had an issue and just sort of pitched it away.
[2067.72s -> 2070.09s]  Must be around somewhere.
[2070.09s -> 2074.25s]  So roll it up while you're at it.
[2074.25s -> 2077.00s]  Will you guys leave?
[2077.00s -> 2079.00s]  No, not to leave.
[2079.00s -> 2083.33s]  I was going to say leave the king alone.
[2083.33s -> 2086.53s]  You guys leave.
[2086.53s -> 2091.65s]  No.
[2091.65s -> 2098.45s]  Like, I'm just going to do this by myself.
[2098.45s -> 2100.45s]  He'll be rolling around the town.
[2100.45s -> 2102.45s]  The Katovari should be, let's see, 50.
[2102.45s -> 2104.45s]  50 centimeters.
[2104.45s -> 2110.48s]  We can believe you can do it in nine minutes.
[2110.48s -> 2113.48s]  Any longer than that and even the king and the cosmos can't wait for you.
[2113.48s -> 2115.48s]  We look forward to a nice Katamari.
[2115.48s -> 2118.30s]  Loser Prince.
[2118.30s -> 2127.64s]  This is my favorite song in the entire album.
[2127.64s -> 2128.64s]  Get out of the way.
[2128.64s -> 2133.06s]  Silverware first.
[2133.06s -> 2134.06s]  And a blue toothbrush.
[2134.06s -> 2142.70s]  It can even be about a blue toothbrush.
[2142.70s -> 2143.70s]  All right.
[2143.70s -> 2144.70s]  This got real though.
[2144.70s -> 2153.46s]  I have to be, I have to actually focus.
[2153.46s -> 2154.46s]  Look at all the little animals.
[2154.46s -> 2155.46s]  What are they collecting?
[2155.46s -> 2157.46s]  What are these little mushroom popovers?
[2157.46s -> 2158.46s]  What are these things called?
[2158.46s -> 2159.46s]  The appetizer with the mushroom?
[2159.46s -> 2160.46s]  What are they called?
[2160.46s -> 2162.46s]  What are they called?
[2162.46s -> 2163.46s]  The stuffed mushroom?
[2163.46s -> 2164.46s]  What is it called?
[2164.46s -> 2165.46s]  A stuffed mushroom.
[2165.46s -> 2177.46s]  Let's roll.
[2177.46s -> 2179.08s]  Let's roll.
[2179.08s -> 2187.00s]  Let's roll, baby.
[2187.00s -> 2190.00s]  I am not, look at the pizza wheel.
[2190.00s -> 2192.00s]  Oh, I love this game.
[2192.00s -> 2196.78s]  I don't think I'm, I can't get these.
[2196.78s -> 2205.76s]  Collect bird.
[2205.76s -> 2207.76s]  I can't, I'm not big enough.
[2207.76s -> 2209.76s]  I can't get these yet.
[2209.76s -> 2213.73s]  Shit, I got to go back.
[2213.73s -> 2220.70s]  I'm not big enough.
[2220.70s -> 2221.70s]  Damn it.
[2221.70s -> 2223.70s]  I did the wrong route.
[2223.70s -> 2225.01s]  No, it's okay.
[2225.01s -> 2226.01s]  I got plenty of time.
[2226.01s -> 2229.23s]  Get out of the way.
[2229.23s -> 2234.70s]  All these.
[2234.70s -> 2235.70s]  Watch this.
[2235.70s -> 2241.29s]  Ready?
[2241.29s -> 2247.15s]  Oh, this feels so good to pick them up.
[2247.15s -> 2255.20s]  Oh, we want some chocolate.
[2255.20s -> 2256.20s]  What?
[2256.20s -> 2258.63s]  Oh shit, there's a cat behind me.
[2258.63s -> 2260.63s]  When am I going to get chocolate?
[2260.63s -> 2270.79s]  What's wrong with me?
[2270.79s -> 2273.54s]  Is this, no, this is tape.
[2273.54s -> 2277.64s]  Am I big enough to get these?
[2277.64s -> 2278.64s]  The cylinders?
[2278.64s -> 2279.64s]  Yep.
[2279.64s -> 2280.64s]  Okay, chocolate.
[2280.64s -> 2281.64s]  And we need to find a present too.
[2281.64s -> 2286.34s]  Get up there.
[2286.34s -> 2287.34s]  I know you can.
[2287.34s -> 2288.34s]  Really?
[2288.34s -> 2290.97s]  All right.
[2293.74s -> 2295.74s]  We have an edible arrangement.
[2295.74s -> 2301.30s]  Now I'm lopsided.
[2301.30s -> 2303.30s]  I need some bigger stuff otherwise this is not going to work.
[2303.30s -> 2304.30s]  Give me the spatulas.
[2304.30s -> 2306.30s]  And the clock.
[2306.30s -> 2314.24s]  Oh, it's 50.
[2314.24s -> 2317.31s]  50 milliliters, okay.
[2317.31s -> 2326.36s]  Get the clock.
[2326.36s -> 2327.36s]  Get the clock.
[2327.36s -> 2331.52s]  Take out food.
[2331.52s -> 2332.52s]  Take out food.
[2332.52s -> 2333.52s]  What?
[2333.52s -> 2335.27s]  I'm stuck.
[2335.27s -> 2337.27s]  I have to jump it.
[2337.27s -> 2338.27s]  Get up there.
[2338.27s -> 2339.27s]  Forget about the cat.
[2339.27s -> 2340.27s]  Just go.
[2340.27s -> 2341.27s]  Where's the clock?
[2341.27s -> 2342.96s]  Get clock.
[2342.96s -> 2343.96s]  Get clock.
[2343.96s -> 2350.64s]  There it is.
[2350.64s -> 2351.64s]  I can't get the clock.
[2351.64s -> 2358.87s]  Watch out for the dung beetle.
[2358.87s -> 2359.87s]  It's stuck.
[2359.87s -> 2360.87s]  I cannot get the clock.
[2360.87s -> 2368.21s]  This dude, you're doing your own Katamari with shit.
[2368.21s -> 2369.21s]  Get out of the way.
[2369.21s -> 2371.54s]  I got it.
[2371.54s -> 2372.54s]  I got the clock.
[2372.54s -> 2373.54s]  Everybody can relax.
[2373.54s -> 2374.54s]  No, I didn't.
[2374.54s -> 2378.18s]  I can't get the clock.
[2378.18s -> 2380.19s]  Sorry.
[2380.19s -> 2385.66s]  You can get it.
[2385.66s -> 2387.66s]  Well, let me just make sure.
[2387.66s -> 2391.66s]  Let me come back when I'm a little able to get, when I'm able to pick that up.
[2391.66s -> 2392.66s]  Back down, okay?
[2392.66s -> 2396.43s]  I'm just stealing the muffins.
[2396.43s -> 2397.43s]  Ooh, too late.
[2397.43s -> 2399.67s]  What are you doing?
[2399.67s -> 2405.42s]  If anything, scamper is what we call it.
[2405.42s -> 2408.07s]  All right.
[2408.07s -> 2409.07s]  I'm now bigger.
[2409.07s -> 2422.17s]  I can't get the clock, everybody.
[2422.17s -> 2424.41s]  It's not going to happen.
[2424.41s -> 2425.41s]  It's glitched out underneath.
[2425.41s -> 2426.41s]  It's not going to happen.
[2426.41s -> 2427.41s]  I only have four minutes.
[2427.41s -> 2435.32s]  I've got to stop listening to you guys about clocks.
[2435.32s -> 2439.44s]  I have to go up here.
[2439.44s -> 2440.44s]  Where have you not gone?
[2440.44s -> 2441.44s]  All right, fish.
[2441.44s -> 2448.70s]  Here we go.
[2448.70s -> 2449.70s]  This will make me 50.
[2449.70s -> 2456.94s]  Oh, no.
[2456.94s -> 2457.94s]  This is not good.
[2457.94s -> 2465.73s]  This is not good.
[2465.73s -> 2466.73s]  Not good.
[2466.73s -> 2467.73s]  I got to get these trees.
[2469.42s -> 2470.42s]  I can't even pick these up.
[2470.42s -> 2474.41s]  I'm not big enough.
[2474.41s -> 2475.41s]  Soda?
[2475.41s -> 2476.41s]  Okay.
[2476.41s -> 2480.08s]  I don't even know the name of this song.
[2480.08s -> 2483.08s]  Do yourself a huge favor and just type in Katamari Damacy OST.
[2483.08s -> 2490.16s]  It looks like a whole damn thing.
[2490.16s -> 2491.16s]  Ooh.
[2491.16s -> 2493.59s]  Found the water jugs.
[2493.59s -> 2503.30s]  Three minutes, I can do it.
[2503.30s -> 2505.30s]  Just get on top.
[2505.30s -> 2509.30s]  Come on.
[2509.30s -> 2512.30s]  Look at all those utensils over here.
[2512.30s -> 2516.89s]  No.
[2516.89s -> 2518.89s]  Don't get stuck back here.
[2518.89s -> 2521.86s]  48.
[2521.86s -> 2525.91s]  I got it.
[2525.91s -> 2526.91s]  We want clock.
[2526.91s -> 2531.65s]  You guys don't really want the clock.
[2531.65s -> 2537.82s]  Plus, I don't even remember where the hell it even is.
[2537.82s -> 2538.82s]  Where's the clock?
[2538.82s -> 2541.02s]  Clock.
[2541.02s -> 2542.02s]  Clock.
[2542.02s -> 2544.34s]  Clock.
[2544.34s -> 2545.34s]  What a nice Katamari.
[2545.34s -> 2546.34s]  Kind of bratty.
[2546.34s -> 2547.34s]  Kind of shy.
[2547.34s -> 2548.71s]  See?
[2548.71s -> 2549.71s]  Flower clock.
[2549.71s -> 2550.71s]  I already got it.
[2550.71s -> 2553.71s]  Now that you've come this far, we would love to have a much bigger and nicer
[2553.71s -> 2554.71s]  one.
[2554.71s -> 2555.71s]  Let's go.
[2555.71s -> 2559.00s]  All right.
[2559.00s -> 2561.00s]  Let's see if I can figure out where that clock was.
[2561.00s -> 2563.00s]  I got two minutes to figure it out.
[2563.00s -> 2569.59s]  Clock or no stream?
[2569.59s -> 2570.59s]  Wasn't it up?
[2570.59s -> 2573.59s]  It was up here to the right, right?
[2573.59s -> 2578.93s]  It's over here.
[2578.93s -> 2579.93s]  Okay.
[2579.93s -> 2580.93s]  Clock.
[2580.93s -> 2585.11s]  Line it up.
[2585.11s -> 2586.11s]  Oh, okay.
[2586.11s -> 2589.78s]  Everybody can calm down.
[2589.78s -> 2590.78s]  See?
[2590.78s -> 2591.78s]  Now you can all hang out.
[2591.78s -> 2592.78s]  Everything's fine.
[2592.78s -> 2598.63s]  I got the clock.
[2598.63s -> 2599.63s]  Clocked.
[2599.63s -> 2603.11s]  Yeah.
[2603.11s -> 2604.11s]  Oh, boy.
[2604.11s -> 2616.61s]  That was an ooh right there.
[2616.61s -> 2619.81s]  You have one minute left.
[2619.81s -> 2622.43s]  I can't go through there.
[2622.43s -> 2623.43s]  I'm too jacked.
[2623.43s -> 2624.43s]  I forget the broom.
[2624.43s -> 2628.74s]  No.
[2628.74s -> 2629.74s]  I get the dust fans.
[2629.74s -> 2630.74s]  This is the best part.
[2630.74s -> 2637.22s]  When you get big enough, you can just rush and roll over everything.
[2637.22s -> 2644.58s]  When I get to 70, can I jump that?
[2644.58s -> 2645.58s]  Come on.
[2645.58s -> 2646.58s]  Jump it.
[2646.58s -> 2653.07s]  Fire extinguishers.
[2653.07s -> 2660.28s]  Time for a fireworks display.
[2660.28s -> 2661.28s]  What?
[2661.28s -> 2665.57s]  What is he talking about?
[2665.57s -> 2666.74s]  Get all the birds.
[2666.74s -> 2669.74s]  I have 10 seconds to get the birds and the cow.
[2669.74s -> 2671.30s]  I got the cow.
[2671.30s -> 2672.30s]  Or dog.
[2672.30s -> 2675.72s]  Whatever it was.
[2675.72s -> 2678.62s]  71.
[2678.62s -> 2683.62s]  It comes and gets to the bunker.
[2683.62s -> 2695.30s]  I didn't get the present.
[2695.30s -> 2699.11s]  Royal Rainbow.
[2699.11s -> 2700.11s]  Take us back.
[2700.11s -> 2708.54s]  24 kill streak.
[2708.54s -> 2716.25s]  It's pretty big.
[2716.25s -> 2718.81s]  We imagine it'll make a pretty good start.
[2718.81s -> 2719.81s]  What even is this game?
[2719.81s -> 2721.81s]  I'm so glad that you don't know what this is.
[2721.81s -> 2725.81s]  It makes me very happy that you don't know because this is an old game from
[2725.81s -> 2730.81s]  PlayStation 2 that they just recently redid, reimagined and remastered.
[2730.81s -> 2733.81s]  I know it's a remake and remastered, but still.
[2733.81s -> 2734.81s]  It's on the Switch.
[2734.81s -> 2735.81s]  It's on Steam.
[2735.81s -> 2736.81s]  Is it on Steam?
[2736.81s -> 2737.81s]  Am I lying?
[2737.81s -> 2738.81s]  Is that a fucking incorrect statement?
[2738.81s -> 2744.46s]  It is.
[2744.46s -> 2745.46s]  Okay.
[2745.46s -> 2746.46s]  Yeah.
[2746.46s -> 2748.47s]  How much is this game?
[2748.47s -> 2749.47s]  This game's like 20, 30 bucks, right?
[2749.47s -> 2754.46s]  I picked up a lot of cooking for this.
[2754.46s -> 2755.46s]  30 bucks?
[2755.46s -> 2756.46s]  30 bucks.
[2756.46s -> 2760.41s]  That's not bad for a game like this.
[2760.41s -> 2767.17s]  There's a lot of content in this game.
[2767.17s -> 2768.17s]  A 30 dollar jug?
[2768.17s -> 2775.17s]  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[2775.17s -> 2783.86s]  I really told you, didn't I?
[2783.86s -> 2784.86s]  Didn't I?
[2784.86s -> 2797.64s]  Am I saying this was made in Unity?
[2797.64s -> 2800.88s]  I can just bait it here.
[2800.88s -> 2807.79s]  That sounds like it could be real though.
[2807.79s -> 2814.60s]  Ported to Unity.
[2814.60s -> 2815.60s]  Okay.
[2815.60s -> 2816.60s]  So it's ported to Unity.
[2816.60s -> 2818.60s]  But Unity is one of those...
[2818.60s -> 2819.60s]  It's one of those things that...
[2819.60s -> 2820.60s]  Oh hey, wow, interesting.
[2820.60s -> 2821.60s]  This was made in Unity.
[2821.60s -> 2838.38s]  My mic is fucked up. Wow, I got it. What? What? I can't hear you. What? I didn't get any
[2838.38s -> 2847.43s]  presents that round so, unfortunately. Pick a star 3. So we have some options here. We're gonna do
[2847.43s -> 2864.82s]  make cancer or make a star 4. Is there anything else? Peek the mic or riot? Why would I do that?
[2864.82s -> 2879.61s]  Yeah. So, 1, 2, listen, this is 3 so let's just stay, no, 1, make a star 2, make a star 3. So 4, 5.
[2879.61s -> 2892.75s]  Peek mic or riot? I'm not gonna peek my mic! What? Why do you want me to do that? Do it. Peek
[2892.75s -> 2905.54s]  the mic. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? What? The game is super loud compared to me.
[2906.64s -> 2919.06s]  That's better. When is the yes? Have you ever been to Spain? It's our other homeland. Peek it.
[2919.06s -> 2976.70s]  I'll do it. Hold on. This is the only time you're gonna get me to do this. I can't do it. I
[2976.70s -> 2981.90s]  can't. I'm trying to capture it on my webcam. I was gonna break the webcam microphone but I
[2981.90s -> 2985.18s]  can't do that right now because I can't. I have my mic on the switch. I have to go
[2985.18s -> 2993.68s]  into my audio device settings. It's not like, hold on. Tell me if this changes anything. What
[2994.36s -> 3000.94s]  is this doing? What is this doing? Is this the same? Is this the same? Do it. Oh, god damn it.
[3000.94s -> 3039.58s]  Just, hold on. No, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. No. That's not gonna
[3039.58s -> 3043.26s]  happen because I can't, I have to like restock my computer for it to recognize the microphone
[3043.26s -> 3051.42s]  here. No, everybody relax. I'm not gonna peek my microphone. It's not recognizing the
[3051.42s -> 3054.22s]  other audio device which is the webcam mic. I'm not gonna peek this one. I'm not gonna
[3054.22s -> 3067.94s]  break my fucking $6,700 of mic, okay? It's not gonna happen. Alright, let's go back to what
[3067.94s -> 3083.58s]  we're doing. Wallet, keys, rings, hopes, and dreams are lost at all. Roll it up while
[3083.58s -> 3095.29s]  you're at it. Break your stuff. I can't believe I just wasted like six straight minutes trying
[3095.29s -> 3104.80s]  to find a way to break the microphone that I have over here. Now, alright, if you stick
[3104.80s -> 3108.20s]  around for the whole stream, I will break this mic over here. I will peek this mic
[3108.20s -> 3112.04s]  until it doesn't work. Not this one, the webcam one. No, no, don't do that.
[3112.04s -> 3119.05s]  Okay, Stakatomari should be one, around one meter. We can believe in you, it's ten minutes,
[3119.05s -> 3125.06s]  one meter. But any longer than that of the king of all cosmos, I can't. We look forward
[3125.06s -> 3138.20s]  to a nice Katomari bite-sized prince. Let's go. There's another great song, too. This
[3138.20s -> 3144.59s]  whole soundtrack. What do the kids say? What do the kids say now, right? Light it
[3144.59s -> 3151.59s]  up, right? This contract is light it up. It's that good. It's like, it causes a fire,
[3151.59s -> 3160.26s]  right? Man, this soundtrack is so good. It's causing a fire in here. Who lit that fire,
[3160.26s -> 3174.33s]  right? No, this is not satisfying to me. I need to, I need this to be satisfying
[3174.33s -> 3182.42s]  to me. Okay, that was that. That was satisfying to me. I can't leave here until I get
[3182.42s -> 3189.41s]  all the erasers. I don't think I'm gonna be, I don't think I'm gonna be able to
[3189.41s -> 3196.44s]  get it, though. I have to go across. Oh, no! There's too much momentum, I had to do
[3196.44s -> 3212.68s]  it. Get out of the way, mouse. There's a bear with a sweater on it. Sing it with
[3212.68s -> 3243.77s]  me now. I'm up here. Get the cones. Not big enough. Fuck. Roll it. I know you
[3243.77s -> 3247.09s]  can do it. I know you can. I've seen you do it before. Come on, you're wasting
[3247.09s -> 3253.70s]  time. You're wasting time. Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. Why are you
[3253.70s -> 3259.58s]  wasting time? Come in here. There we go. Get all the erasers. You can't marry as
[3259.58s -> 3277.00s]  big as 24 lipsticks. Get it bigger already. Just get it bigger. Forehead. Okay.
[3277.00s -> 3289.12s]  Is that all the erasers? I think that's all the erasers. You see? No, just a bit more.
[3289.12s -> 3302.45s]  Oh, erasers. Sing it with me now. I'm not even singing it. Why do I keep saying sing it with me now?
[3302.45s -> 3320.42s]  Oh, sing it with me now! Okay, can I break through the window? I'll be
[3320.46s -> 3331.44s]  eventually big enough to go through here. I'm missing, but I didn't get. Get the whole line of rats.
[3331.44s -> 3348.26s]  What am I missing here? The pencils? Orange peels? There we go. Nice roll-up. So
[3348.26s -> 3358.94s]  eristic from it. We are dazzled. Let's just roll it up before it runs off.
[3358.94s -> 3364.26s]  Why do you want me to roll up the animal? Right through, straight through. Here we go.
[3364.26s -> 3371.83s]  Get them all. Get all the cigarette packs. Don't smoke, but just pick them up if they're on the
[3371.83s -> 3379.13s]  ground. Don't pick cigarettes up if they're on the ground. Throw them in the trash when you do
[3379.13s -> 3395.65s]  that. 20 centimeters. Not a long, long way to go, but it really does exponentially. Light bulb?
[3395.65s -> 3404.11s]  Is this a sentient light bulb? What? If you can't make the Kazamari bigger, you can't get to the
[3404.15s -> 3429.62s]  next stage. I'm working on it. It's not my fault this house is so fucked up. Little birds. I'll be back for those bears.
[3429.62s -> 3454.65s]  Really? Watermelon? That's not gonna make me grow? Just a baby. Just a very strong baby. Putting
[3454.65s -> 3462.10s]  the square peg into the circle hole. And he does it. That's a strong baby. That was
[3462.78s -> 3485.41s]  Santa hat. At least I'm big enough to get these. This whole area, I think I can get. I'm losing so much
[3485.41s -> 3497.43s]  because I keep running into things I'm not supposed to be. The whole fridge worth of stuff. Here we go.
[3497.43s -> 3504.12s]  This is where, now we exponentially get marked. All the tuna cans. Mustard. Ketchup. Relish.
[3504.12s -> 3521.74s]  Bananas. Toast. Cheeseburger. Can I get it? I just want the milk. All right. It's back to
[3521.74s -> 3534.91s]  come out here. Let's see. Steal all their toys. How can I not get those? Santa hat? Santa? Where?
[3534.91s -> 3546.51s]  Did I miss the Santa hat? Here's the worst part about this game being that somebody's watching and you
[3546.51s -> 3564.71s]  play this. There are items that I just miss and you're like, oh! Get it! Oh! Bathtub. Uh oh.
[3565.59s -> 3572.79s]  Oh no. No, no, no. Get me out of here. Because I'm losing a centimeter a second. Get me out of the
[3572.79s -> 3583.98s]  corner. Out of the corner. Jump. Oh shit. No, that was pizza pizza I think. I want to keep
[3583.98s -> 3602.10s]  that. No, that's my dog bone. Oh! Oh thank god. I need to be a meter. Under the sink. I can. I
[3602.18s -> 3608.86s]  can get all of both of them. Just be careful. Wedged in under the sink. Don't hit the gas line.
[3614.05s -> 3622.22s]  I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it, am I?
[3629.20s -> 3638.77s]  Fuck. There we go. Hold on. It's possible now. Only 50 still. I got half way to go.
[3639.89s -> 3652.48s]  Exponential. Come on. This is where you exponentially grow. Do it. Come on. Get in here.
[3652.48s -> 3671.33s]  No, no, no. The bathtub. The bathtub ruined the whole thing. Try to get up there. 60. Almost 60.
[3671.33s -> 3685.50s]  Come on. Grow another. 67. Oh, I gotta get to 100. When's the next big growth period here?
[3686.22s -> 3705.38s]  When do I get my new growth spurt? Is it TV? 75. One minute left. Back outside. 50 seconds.
[3708.27s -> 3718.85s]  Go! Get everything. Just dash everywhere. Pick up the cat. Pick up the shopping cart.
[3720.40s -> 3738.18s]  I can't. Fuck the cat. Fuck that cat. Come on! I get it. What a nice cat to borrow.
[3739.92s -> 3744.24s]  Tough get with a soft feel. Now that you've come this far, we'd like to have it a little
[3744.24s -> 3759.04s]  bigger. Okay, let's see how I can get it. I can't. I don't even know where I am.
[3760.00s -> 3772.53s]  I can't go back in the house. Oh, I'm in the house! Oh! I made it to the house. Damn it.
[3778.05s -> 3781.17s]  I can't believe it. I got in the house and I would have just sucked up everything.
[3781.81s -> 3793.44s]  It's a coarse goal, but it's not very exciting. We want a bigger one next time.
[3794.56s -> 3799.92s]  The thing you can collect at the most is play time. I don't even know what that even
[3799.92s -> 3807.90s]  means. Play time? Earth really is full of them. Time to release it into the sky.
[3808.70s -> 3815.31s]  What's this one called? Toys is the name of the star.
[3828.75s -> 3864.45s]  To be, why does it say to be continued every time? To be continued. Say the game? No,
[3864.45s -> 3870.16s]  don't think so. That's not even funny. Like, it's not funny. Because if for some reason
[3871.36s -> 3875.44s]  the game crashes or the console crashes or something, that's not even funny.
[3876.90s -> 3879.46s]  Oh, it's funny. We have to restart the whole game. Isn't that funny?
[3880.10s -> 3891.04s]  Like, no, that's not funny. That would be a waste of time. Santa? Wait, Santa hat?
[3891.04s -> 3909.31s]  I didn't get any presents. Oh, this is annoying. I had one present. All right, back to Earth.
[3912.69s -> 3917.09s]  Santa hat. All right, we've opened up more things. Here is,
[3918.13s -> 3924.27s]  uh, star five. We have to make constellations here. Okay, let's go.
[3925.07s -> 3935.04s]  They can't. What is it? Something's not quite there. Oh, yes, we get it. It just doesn't look
[3935.04s -> 3940.82s]  delicious. The sky does not seem yummy at all. Everyone is still hungry, yes? Can't you see that,
[3940.82s -> 3946.90s]  silly? Speaking of delicious, we must say, most certainly, we say crab. Most certainly crab.
[3951.17s -> 3960.54s]  What a delightfully weird fucking dude. It's just what? I can't even read that.
[3963.90s -> 3973.89s]  What the fuck? I didn't even do it. Looks yummy. But no, no, not yet. Patience is a virtue. Focus,
[3973.89s -> 3982.03s]  we must focus. To make the yummiest... Okay, we need crabs. All you have to do is roll up as
[3982.03s -> 3988.69s]  many crabs as you can find. Let's see. You have seven minutes to roll up as many crabs as
[3988.69s -> 3998.51s]  possible. We look forward to a mouth-watering catamari, callow prince. Go. Crabs. Oh! Oh,
[3998.51s -> 4007.06s]  I can't. I hate them. Why is a crab on the spider web? Why is a crab hanging from a spider
[4007.06s -> 4017.63s]  web? What the fuck? Doesn't make any sense. I wish it was like that. I would love if spiders
[4017.63s -> 4021.79s]  weren't spiders. They were just crabs. I would love them. They would be so fun.
[4026.88s -> 4038.93s]  Crabs are spiders with armor. No, crabs are fun and funny and spiders are evil. I know this because
[4038.93s -> 4043.65s]  they're holding the toothbrushes. That's so... I love this. You know how I know this? Because
[4043.65s -> 4049.65s]  every television show and movie I've ever seen in my whole life, spider was evil and goes like
[4053.31s -> 4066.59s]  and every crab is a funny character that likes money or the dances and shit. That's all I've
[4066.59s -> 4074.27s]  ever been told. So of course I'm going to be scared of spiders and not crabs because of that
[4074.27s -> 4085.84s]  stupid monster noise that I just made. Oh! Me money! Me money, SpongeBob! That's not like...
[4087.60s -> 4120.35s]  Why would I be scared of that? There's never been one spider in the history of media
[4120.91s -> 4126.43s]  that wasn't evil and had foam coming out of their mouth. I think it was like Charlotte's
[4126.43s -> 4150.02s]  Web. That's the only one. Crabs foam at the mouth? Oh, they don't. Spider-Man? But Spider-Man is a
[4150.02s -> 4157.12s]  man that was bit by a spider. That's not the same thing. And the spider that bit him was
[4157.12s -> 4162.40s]  terrifying because for some reason he got superpowers by being bit by a black widow
[4162.40s -> 4169.87s]  radioactive fucking spider. That's scary. Oh yeah, but be careful. There's the
[4169.87s -> 4174.19s]  black widow that'll bite you with radioactive poison in its fangs. Oh, but like it's Spider-Man.
[4175.39s -> 4182.85s]  The spider that bit Spider-Man, it was too small for you to hear it, but right before it bit him
[4182.85s -> 4195.76s]  it definitely went like... just didn't pick up on the microphone. I need more crab. I can't get
[4195.76s -> 4215.65s]  the funny crab with shoes on. The shrimp looks good too. I hate this shrimp. I have to get
[4215.65s -> 4228.75s]  the super crab. Crabs literally foam at the mouth to breathe. Yeah, but I see that as like
[4228.75s -> 4243.79s]  flavored foam at the mouth, like Starburst, not like evil's venom foam. Am I not big enough to
[4243.79s -> 4267.94s]  get you? You know what I mean. Laughing at his own joke? No, I'm laughing at the interpretation
[4267.94s -> 4274.08s]  of the thing that I said, which on second revelation it sounds pretty fucking dumb.
[4274.80s -> 4291.90s]  The crabs? There's no more. I've ran out. The only crabs over here and I'm too big to
[4291.90s -> 4312.72s]  get in there. There's some up. How do I go up? Can I climb? Jump? I can't. I don't have a jump.
[4312.72s -> 4321.06s]  There's nowhere else I can go. Can I get up there? No, I can't. I can like go like this,
[4321.06s -> 4329.74s]  but that doesn't do anything. There's an elevator? Where's there an elevator?
[4329.74s -> 4344.70s]  That's not an elevator. This is not an elevator. Those are two chess pieces. Oh,
[4344.70s -> 4365.07s]  come on. Really? All right, I got 90. Can I make it up? I need 100. Come on. There's
[4365.07s -> 4377.15s]  one right there. Got him. 97. Come on. 98, 99. How did I not get the one in the corner?
[4377.71s -> 4406.93s]  I need 100. I need 100 or I'm going to turn off this ring. What? What the fuck? I got it.
[4406.93s -> 4416.10s]  I got it. I got 100. If you Starburst is reminding you of foaming at the mouth,
[4416.82s -> 4420.34s]  then no. By the way, I'm just fucking pissed about Starburst. Can I tell you?
[4421.30s -> 4428.16s]  I bought and I realized why there was a there was a box of Starburst, like a big box
[4428.16s -> 4433.33s]  that was on sale. I was like, holy shit, I like Starburst. Starburst are awesome.
[4433.33s -> 4439.81s]  I bought the box. The thing was on sale and Starburst don't have a fucking expiration date on
[4439.81s -> 4448.32s]  them. Can Starburst even expire? They made it a plastic rubber and they did take a droplet
[4448.32s -> 4459.78s]  and drop a little bit of flavoring juice on them. You just chew out the flavoring and then
[4459.78s -> 4463.06s]  you spit it out. You're not supposed to swallow Starburst guys. It stays in your stomach
[4463.06s -> 4472.34s]  for like eight years. You chew it up until it's like a pale transparent color and then you just
[4472.34s -> 4479.54s]  spit it out. You don't want to be ingesting that. Have you seen the ingredient list?
[4495.09s -> 4504.96s]  Oh shit, I've been eating them wrong. That actually does look kind of delicious. No,
[4504.96s -> 4511.84s]  it doesn't. Yeah, every Starburst you've ever eaten. Oh, hold on. I'll tell you in a minute.
[4530.16s -> 4540.38s]  Teapot. I love how that's the one thing you got out of that entire sequence
[4540.94s -> 4545.98s]  and how delightfully odd that whole thing was. The teapot is the thing. Whoa, I can't believe
[4545.98s -> 4568.30s]  there was a teapot there. But just be careful when you eat Starburst guys because the stage
[4568.30s -> 4572.86s]  is done for 10 years. So let's say you have like 200 Starbursts over the course of like
[4572.86s -> 4577.78s]  four years or something. Eventually you're gonna, you know, 10 years from now you'll be
[4577.78s -> 4585.54s]  like in your late 50s and you're just you're gonna shit out a gigantic flavored size
[4585.54s -> 4609.15s]  like basketball. Crap, loud. What do we got? We unlocked a Star, let's do Starfire.
[4610.03s -> 4623.90s]  Yeah, you're gonna shit out a giant rubber flavored basketball. What are you gonna do
[4623.90s -> 4635.07s]  with that? Ever been to the Netherlands? We stopped in the day before yesterday.
[4635.07s -> 4639.50s]  We hope you can visit during the day's rolling like that's possible. Oh yes,
[4639.50s -> 4650.61s]  I mean why does he keep saying like that's possible? There's another present down here.
[4650.61s -> 4663.38s]  I want to get another present. I'm gonna work my ass off for this present. Hey Jerma,
[4663.38s -> 4667.46s]  I just made the math. I have 150 hours of old streams to watch. So can you please stop
[4667.46s -> 4674.70s]  streaming for 150 days? I don't think I could do that. Sorry that you're gonna be forever
[4674.70s -> 4687.44s]  catching up. Okay, today you'll be rolling around the town. The Katamari should be,
[4687.44s -> 4696.38s]  let's see, around 15, 1.5 meters. There's a point there. 13 minutes for 1.5. Any longer,
[4696.38s -> 4701.02s]  and you'll be very angry. There's a gift here too. Tell me, okay, if you see the gift,
[4701.02s -> 4712.74s]  tell me the location of it. Because my eyes aren't so good anymore. You know, I'm gonna
[4712.74s -> 4718.77s]  take this one slow because I want to be sure I don't crash into everything, pick up all the
[4718.77s -> 4732.43s]  eggs. Quail chick. Not big enough for that. Ha ha, it's there. I'll know when I look over
[4732.43s -> 4737.23s]  the chat and see 500 million people all writing the same thing with like fail fish.
[4737.95s -> 4744.78s]  Because I would have passed it three or four times by then. Use your eyes, fail fish. Use
[4744.78s -> 4748.86s]  your eyes. Is he this bad on purpose? Like, once I start seeing that, is when I know
[4750.78s -> 4779.76s]  that I'm close. Pretending. I'm not big enough for the milk. I need to drink more of that to
[4779.76s -> 4786.72s]  get bigger. Well, I don't. But whatever, just clip it and fucking use it in your video or
[4786.72s -> 4806.05s]  whatever the hell you're making. Get it! I need to get to 15. I think I grow a little more.
[4807.71s -> 4818.82s]  Super glue? It's not 15. What is it? I'm getting all the little teeny tiny stuff first.
[4818.82s -> 4837.47s]  It's always the hardest part. The trees. Parsley. Reminds me of Jetset Radio song.
[4839.84s -> 4848.30s]  Both with good soundtrack. This soundtrack is so good. I remember having this on a CD
[4849.34s -> 4863.90s]  that I would play in my car. Oh, look at this. Perfect. And I remember specifically stopping
[4863.90s -> 4872.82s]  at red lights with the windows down and blasting the title theme with all the windows
[4872.82s -> 4896.61s]  down. I remember there was one time. Okay, so listen, hear me out on this. This is like
[4896.61s -> 4902.29s]  really embarrassing, but whatever, who cares? It's not even though, but it is. So one time
[4902.29s -> 4911.81s]  I was driving some co-workers at the time home and I had a CD that was a lot of video
[4911.81s -> 4915.81s]  game music on the CD. And you know when you turn your car off when you're listening to
[4915.81s -> 4922.77s]  music and you're blasting something just like, Oh yeah, this is like my alone me time music.
[4923.73s -> 4928.61s]  Well, that's what it was. It was like a bunch of video game shit on it. And
[4930.05s -> 4934.77s]  my co-workers at the time, when they weren't like into video games, they didn't really.
[4935.49s -> 4941.41s]  This is also probably like, this is like 15 years ago. So anyways, I'm driving them home
[4942.29s -> 4947.17s]  and as we get in the car and I turn the car on and we start, Oh, there's music in here.
[4947.17s -> 4955.25s]  Oh, wait a minute. And the battle sequence theme from Lost Odyssey is playing loud.
[4960.93s -> 4968.38s]  It was just like, what is this? And I had to cover my tracks. You know what I mean?
[4968.94s -> 4974.62s]  Cause it's like a symphony orchestra is what's playing. And I remember just going,
[4974.62s -> 4978.54s]  Oh, I love classical music. I'm like, I listen to classical music sometimes when I drive.
[4979.42s -> 4989.07s]  I bet he was beat red. It probably was. That's even worse. I have to,
[4990.19s -> 4999.95s]  I had to cover my tracks. Ah, yes. Mozart. Yeah. So I had to look like the guy driving around
[4999.95s -> 5006.67s]  listening to fucking Mozart. And honestly, I'm, let me tell you something about classical
[5006.67s -> 5009.07s]  music. And now I'm going to, a lot of people are probably going to disagree with me here,
[5009.79s -> 5016.51s]  but the only time I ever hear classical music ever is when you were at the dentist getting
[5016.51s -> 5031.01s]  surgery. So I don't want to be the guy listening to classical music. Like when you're getting
[5031.01s -> 5037.06s]  like your teeth pulled, the guys listening to classical music, I don't want to listen to that.
[5037.62s -> 5041.94s]  And there's nothing wrong with classical music. It's really, you know, very expertly crafted.
[5045.82s -> 5051.66s]  It's amazing pieces and they work so well and there's so much wonderful, wonderful music.
[5052.14s -> 5063.30s]  That has come out of full orchestras and classical instruments. But I don't, I don't,
[5063.30s -> 5068.05s]  I'm not listening to it in my car, like hanging out with friends. Like, oh, what do you,
[5068.05s -> 5072.51s]  what do you got, man? What's on your, what's on your playlist? Oh, well, you know, I've got,
[5072.51s -> 5081.55s]  you know, Eminem, I guess, I think. And then like, it'd be like, dude, what the fuck is
[5081.55s -> 5100.80s]  this? It's like, ah, nothing. There's a play, where's the present? No one has seen it yet.
[5101.44s -> 5116.77s]  But I love listening to classical music. I do. But for some reason, I don't know why this is,
[5116.77s -> 5120.93s]  but classical music really is just, you don't, you don't want people to know that you're
[5120.93s -> 5127.49s]  listening to it. I don't know why. If everyone can agree that classical music is so wonderful,
[5128.29s -> 5145.28s]  well, we're not allowed to play it in our cars. What is this? I love in the middle of
[5145.28s -> 5152.21s]  that. Is he this bad on purpose? So there's a way through here. I just get it. Okay.
[5152.93s -> 5161.73s]  No, I love, I love classical music, but I also don't listen to like really any music.
[5163.79s -> 5177.01s]  You guys all know that because you're wondering why everyone's like, what are you talking about?
[5177.01s -> 5182.05s]  Question mark. Because I'm a fucking idiot. Like I'm an imbecile. And for some reason,
[5182.05s -> 5186.77s]  when I have music on, it's the only thing I can do. I can't put music on in the
[5186.77s -> 5191.01s]  background. I can't, I can't have a conversation while music's playing. It's just like,
[5191.01s -> 5194.53s]  I can hear it. I just think though, okay, I'm here, the lyrics and talking and there's the
[5194.53s -> 5205.38s]  beat and I'm talking too, but I can't cause I have to hear, but what are you doing now?
[5207.49s -> 5210.77s]  Yeah. But this is different because this has to be on here because this is the whole, this is
[5210.77s -> 5215.89s]  like 70. This is 0.70. No, this is seven. This is like 50% of the reason why you play
[5215.89s -> 5220.58s]  the game. No, that's like 30% because this, this is not, you know what I'm saying? It's
[5220.58s -> 5226.08s]  a fucking amazing sound. Okay. Case in point. I couldn't just talk to you there
[5227.14s -> 5229.30s]  because I heard like the construction music in the background.
[5230.02s -> 5255.57s]  Where's that entrance? Up here somewhere? I did actually go past it. This has to be 1.5 meters,
[5255.57s -> 5266.03s]  right? I gotta be kind of on the ball here. Not pretending. Let me get home. Let me,
[5266.03s -> 5280.45s]  let me get the Jenga thumb. I can't get that. Really? Fail, fail, fail. Yeah. I
[5280.45s -> 5289.30s]  don't listen to music. I'm such a fucking strange person, man. I listen to music alone
[5289.30s -> 5296.02s]  in my office sitting here and I put on stuff like Pac-Man's theme from Smash Brothers.
[5296.02s -> 5315.23s]  Like the cool one. And I listen to it like 17 times in a row. Is that weird? And then
[5315.23s -> 5321.78s]  you get to the one part of the, holy shit, I'm going fast. Oh, do it again. Do it again.
[5321.78s -> 5328.99s]  Have to do that again. So you pick like the one part in the song that you want to hear
[5328.99s -> 5335.18s]  over and over again. You get to that part of the song where it's like the big breakdown
[5335.18s -> 5341.95s]  and you listen to it like 87 times. And then you wonder silently to yourself,
[5342.83s -> 5348.59s]  what like the, the YouTube data algorithm on your profile looks like and where you've
[5348.59s -> 5356.74s]  clicked on this same video, like 185 times. Get out of the way. I need to get a strike.
[5357.38s -> 5376.88s]  All right, here we go. I can't see. Oh, close enough. I just got wrecked by a cat.
[5376.88s -> 5386.22s]  You listen to music on YouTube. See? I told you. I knew there was something wrong with it.
[5386.22s -> 5395.10s]  I knew there was something wrong with what I was doing. I don't have very much time left.
[5395.10s -> 5412.06s]  I got to focus here. The radishes, what you do with music. Who's on this bike?
[5412.62s -> 5418.82s]  What you do with music is normal. Everybody does that. So are people just pretending they
[5418.82s -> 5425.26s]  don't do that? I don't know, because I know a lot of people that have Spotify open and they
[5425.26s -> 5439.95s]  don't, I don't think they've heard the same song twice. Like, oh, I have a Spotify on the
[5439.95s -> 5446.54s]  discover mode. Yeah. I've probably listened to 14,000 songs in the last like five years.
[5447.42s -> 5459.10s]  The same clip. Wait, I can pick up the water? No, those are rookie numbers. I'm going to lose
[5459.90s -> 5477.50s]  1.5. Come on, dogs. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Get out. Out, out, out, out, out.
[5478.78s -> 5492.22s]  Oh, fuck. Into the supermarket. Oh no, I'm going to lose. Why are there so many people
[5492.22s -> 5515.70s]  in the way? Get out of the fucking way. No. We were talking about fucking starbursts
[5515.70s -> 5530.00s]  and shitting out basketballs. I was going to pay attention. Everything you do is kind of lame.
[5530.00s -> 5534.24s]  Nobody wears sharp horns like that anymore. And why is your head so wide? For the record,
[5534.24s -> 5539.28s]  there's nothing here. Well, you get your stardust today. I'll do a better job next time.
[5540.32s -> 5557.28s]  Do it again. Was I really loud right there? I don't want to be like the loud guy.
[5566.10s -> 5569.86s]  Have you been to the Netherlands? Yeah, it's the same one. I'll get it this time. Fast.
[5570.74s -> 5575.10s]  You waste the time going back up the hill for the bowling joke. You
[5575.50s -> 5587.90s]  dare. But we were talking about how crabs aren't spiders. I had to pay attention to that. That
[5587.90s -> 5598.86s]  was more important. All right, 1.5. Let's do it. In the very beginning, I was like,
[5598.86s -> 5612.34s]  I'm going to take my time. Be very careful. No, just go. Are lobsters spiders? Well, no,
[5612.34s -> 5619.04s]  because lobsters look like, really, they just look like lobsters. There's no other
[5619.04s -> 5628.45s]  animal or crustacean that even looked remotely similar. When I look at crab, I think, okay,
[5628.45s -> 5633.33s]  that's a spider. When I see lobster, I say that's a lobster. That's it. There's nothing
[5633.33s -> 5643.12s]  you can even compare a lobster to. A shrimp? Yeah. Yeah, that's just like a big shrimp.
[5656.78s -> 5671.55s]  Nothing compares to you. Am I accidentally, purposely avoiding all the shit I need to pick
[5671.55s -> 5680.35s]  up right now? Oh yeah, there's a scorpion in the house today. That was different. I've never
[5680.35s -> 5688.19s]  seen one before. I have not seen a scorpion in real life ever until two hours ago, like an hour
[5688.19s -> 5700.56s]  ago. Finally, a game that punishes stalling. Well, that's why we're not stalling anymore.
[5700.56s -> 5713.54s]  Did I freak out? No, because it was already dead. I talked to Talix about it. I was like,
[5713.54s -> 5723.82s]  did you kill a scorpion down here? No. Oh, it was really weird. And we don't think that
[5723.82s -> 5728.06s]  the dogs had anything to do with it. Maybe one of the dogs went after it and got it.
[5728.54s -> 5734.88s]  You got to be careful there, though, because a dog can get actually very seriously injured
[5734.88s -> 5747.65s]  from a scorpion or a large insect. So we have a little talk about what we need to do.
[5748.45s -> 5753.23s]  And we need to start this kind of thing. It's weird. It's December. A scorpion in December.
[5755.26s -> 5763.26s]  I thought all bugs go to hell. Well, I mean, all bugs go to hell, but they disappear
[5764.22s -> 5782.21s]  for the winter months. That's why it was inside. All bugs go to Valhalla. No, are you kidding me?
[5783.23s -> 5787.23s]  It's like if a scorpion was in, like crawled in front of Odin, no, he's so strong.
[5787.95s -> 5793.92s]  That's me, Odin. I'm the most powerful. Oh, it's a scorpion. Get it out of here. Thor.
[5793.92s -> 5803.87s]  Thor, help me, Thor. And Thor comes in. What is it, father? Ew, ew. And then Thor is like,
[5803.87s -> 5808.19s]  don't worry, I will use my hammer. And oh, it grows.
[5810.19s -> 5812.91s]  And then somebody finally, like, throws a grom at it and kills it.
[5825.36s -> 5830.80s]  Could you miss any more items? I was supposed to be paying attention. All right, no more fucking
[5830.80s -> 5853.66s]  around. Could you miss any more items? You know, you're right. They do have a coin.
[5856.72s -> 5859.92s]  I can't just leave it up to the last 10 seconds. You know what I mean? I got to
[5859.92s -> 5868.85s]  get big now. You know, turn on the infomercial. I used to look like you.
[5870.11s -> 5879.82s]  Scrawny, small. And then I started drinking Jack's juice. Oh, by the way,
[5879.82s -> 5893.01s]  all this is is just maltodextrin. A shitload of it. And some chocolate powder.
[5893.01s -> 5911.01s]  I can't get up there. Fuck. He's dodging items. I need to just shut up and play, man.
[5914.40s -> 5918.16s]  Did my brain subconsciously think this was an avoid the object game?
[5918.80s -> 5924.21s]  I'm sitting here talking, and I'm, oh, watch out, I don't want to run into anything.
[5924.21s -> 5935.06s]  All right, I got bigger. All right, eight minutes. I got enough time.
[5935.06s -> 5948.37s]  Pick up, I want to pick up this shit on your car, man. Get all the envelopes,
[5948.37s -> 5955.97s]  get the Nintendo. I can't pick up the Nintendo? All right, I need to go,
[5955.97s -> 5966.54s]  I need to change locations. Only 35 centimeters. All right, this is where we pick up
[5966.54s -> 5985.55s]  the whole world. I'm just gonna get to 50, pick up all the soda bottles.
[5985.55s -> 5993.87s]  There's a lot more soda bottles over here. Good. I could go for one of those tees.
[5994.59s -> 5999.01s]  Yeah, playing Katamari, you really do need to have snacks available.
[5999.57s -> 6005.23s]  And now it wants me to go through here. There's a way through there.
[6005.79s -> 6008.93s]  So I'm gonna, I'm gonna wrap around. I'm gonna get a little bit bigger first.
[6009.81s -> 6016.88s]  Get all the crabs. At least most of them. Now it's hiding.
[6016.88s -> 6018.88s]  Don't even worry about it. Nintendo. Can I pick up the Nintendo?
[6019.68s -> 6027.87s]  Now I can. Okay. Katamari is about hitting the wall and stalling.
[6029.44s -> 6034.40s]  How dare you say that. What? I'm not big enough to go through there?
[6039.81s -> 6048.85s]  Stop. Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh. Not when I'm playing Katamari Damacy.
[6049.41s -> 6072.29s]  Strike. Doing way better than I did last time. So, wait. I can't pick up the full
[6072.29s -> 6076.02s]  watermelons? I can only pick up half watermelons. What kind of video game
[6076.02s -> 6085.28s]  do you think you are? This is where I'm gonna have a lot of time to exponentially take out
[6085.28s -> 6110.94s]  everything in here. Solar panels? Please move. Can I pick these up yet?
[6110.94s -> 6115.09s]  I feel like I did the same stupid shit last time. I definitely did.
[6123.95s -> 6128.03s]  This is the guy that runs into walls and stalls playing Katamari.
[6128.03s -> 6140.88s]  The melons germo. I couldn't get them. I could get them now.
[6140.88s -> 6153.28s]  I couldn't get them. I couldn't do it. All right. Let's take a trip over here.
[6153.28s -> 6156.24s]  Try to pick up as many radishes as I can because they're pretty large.
[6156.88s -> 6161.73s]  I'm gonna go up here again. Back to the street.
[6163.26s -> 6165.58s]  Anything else that I missed over here? There's a guy lying down.
[6166.38s -> 6170.86s]  Okay. Didn't do anything I thought that was gonna do.
[6171.18s -> 6186.06s]  Wait...I'm almost there. 150. Did I get the sign? Did I have the barber?
[6186.62s -> 6194.75s]  Can't get the sign. I'm going back up because there's a
[6194.75s -> 6197.63s]  lot of shit that I can get over here now that I couldn't previously.
[6213.06s -> 6217.55s]  He's too fat. I mean, am I? I'm not really though.
[6218.85s -> 6221.09s]  That's good. I want to be huge down these halls so I can just
[6221.09s -> 6230.11s]  accidentally pick up everything. Yeah, take down this whole wall.
[6230.67s -> 6240.99s]  I got the phone. This may have actually been a terrible idea, you're right.
[6240.99s -> 6248.16s]  I gotta stay on the road. This was a very bad idea.
[6248.64s -> 6264.22s]  This was a very bad idea. Oh no, this was a terrible fucking idea.
[6264.94s -> 6269.39s]  Get back down here. Down. Back down. Back down. Forget about everything here. Go.
[6276.53s -> 6294.40s]  Oh shit. Shit. What have I done? Get the cat. What the fuck have I done?
[6300.61s -> 6304.69s]  Oh, I'm so mad. What was I fucking talking? I said Thor's name and it's angering me.
[6305.41s -> 6338.61s]  I'm actually fucked here. I think I can fit. I can't jump. I can't fit through this at...
[6338.69s -> 6342.53s]  Oh, I'm so mad at myself. You have no idea. I'm fucking furious with myself.
[6346.75s -> 6356.86s]  I am furious with myself because I went back up here and now I can't go back down. I am
[6356.86s -> 6374.22s]  absolutely livid. Why did I come back up here? Why? What was the purpose of coming up here?
[6375.02s -> 6417.30s]  Why can I... Why could I even... Okay, here's what I don't understand. Why could I fit back
[6417.30s -> 6437.47s]  through there the first time? And then when I lost like 25 centimeters, I couldn't go back down.
[6438.11s -> 6442.70s]  Really? Like I told... I don't even pay attention this time. Let's talk about Thor like throwing
[6443.34s -> 6469.42s]  darts at a scorpion. It's a pretty try-hard time. It is. I'm not gonna lose this one.
[6469.42s -> 6474.21s]  We want some grace back in the sky, but the swans don't seem to have hatched yet.
[6474.21s -> 6479.54s]  Pick up eggs. Don't... Nobody talk about any other topics besides Katamari.
[6479.54s -> 6488.90s]  Get as many as you can and make as... Okay, gotta pick up as many eggs as I can.
[6491.23s -> 6497.28s]  Seven minutes. I'm not talking about anything else. Look at Katamari eggs. Where's... Where
[6497.28s -> 6503.92s]  do I go from here? To the left. Pick up more of these eggs. Cool. All right. Eggs.
[6507.15s -> 6515.76s]  Make sure I get them all. Am I big enough? Yes, I am. I can get these ones. Focus on them.
[6517.12s -> 6520.32s]  Watch out. You don't... Well, it's going to happen every time I do this.
[6522.61s -> 6546.37s]  I'm trying to get seven. I ate like fucking 30 eggs. Okay, I got four. Four. Wait,
[6546.37s -> 6567.28s]  they can't be broken. Oh shit. Why does that one not count? They have to be swans.
[6574.53s -> 6578.46s]  You know what they say? You don't make eggs without what? Yeah, this is a beautiful song.
[6578.94s -> 6589.68s]  Don't fall off. Get them off. Cool. How many swans do I need? Just as many as I can get.
[6590.40s -> 6594.77s]  There's a lot up here.
[6604.13s -> 6607.41s]  Some of them are not going to be swans. I'm going to try to get 50 swans.
[6608.45s -> 6609.65s]  That's a number that's way too high.
[6614.59s -> 6620.99s]  There's another one. Just a regular egg.
[6620.99s -> 6631.63s]  They're hitting eggs with a golf club? What a sick fuck.
[6634.74s -> 6635.94s]  Just sit here for a second. Get them all.
[6648.03s -> 6652.83s]  What is a swan anyway? No, don't get me talking. Do not get me to talk.
[6652.99s -> 6665.28s]  I can't be trusted when I start speaking. It's a silent stream. I'm going to go underneath
[6665.28s -> 6678.66s]  because I'm still small enough to get these. If I got stuck under there, I would have just
[6679.46s -> 6684.70s]  swallowed the switch. I would have been the first person to ever eat a switch.
[6685.74s -> 6711.87s]  Oh, you momentum. Come on. You can't get angry. Yes, you can. Oh yes, you can. I was
[6712.83s -> 6716.18s]  going to say with the soundtrack playing in the background.
[6737.71s -> 6744.78s]  All right. We suspect. All right, I got 24. What do I want? 50? I'm probably only going to get
[6744.78s -> 6756.48s]  25. Oh, I haven't got up here. Can I get up there? All right. Duckling, duckling, swan. 25.
[6757.52s -> 6771.47s]  Can I make it up this way? Say something. No, not yet. This one is very specific.
[6781.22s -> 6786.88s]  I got to get to 30. You know what I'm saying? I got to get to 30. I mean, I don't understand.
[6788.48s -> 6811.63s]  30. 29. 30. I'm going to climb up on a shoe to get up here. Get up there, dude. What?
[6811.63s -> 6818.14s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? It can't be a weird number like 31.
[6822.77s -> 6825.41s]  It's got to be like 45 or something, right?
[6827.25s -> 6829.09s]  How many characters were in the last Smash Brothers game?
[6830.72s -> 6846.32s]  42. 43. That's how much we need. I can't live with this if it's 36.
[6847.12s -> 6866.27s]  Here we go. I'll get some here. You have one minute left. 38. 39. No, don't do 39.
[6866.83s -> 6869.07s]  It's going to be 41. I'm going to stop playing after I get to 40.
[6871.87s -> 6878.75s]  45. 45. Get it. 50. I can get 50. Don't sell yourself
[6879.98s -> 6920.94s]  under what you would assume. No, not 46. Oh, 46. Very graceful and a bit disturbing.
[6921.66s -> 6933.98s]  Tweet, tweet, tweet. Noisy things will take the graceful rainbow back. Restart. 46 is not bad.
[6933.98s -> 6952.29s]  That's 65 percent. That's a D. All you have to do is pass. 46 smalls. Commonplace grace.
[6952.29s -> 6958.61s]  Skin deep grace. Fake grace. Grace and light. It'll be a counterfeit constellation.
[6958.61s -> 6963.49s]  It will be a pale imitation of a swan in the sky. All righty, let's just release it into the
[6963.49s -> 6973.79s]  sky. He's mad at me for getting a D on my report card. You need a 70 to pass. Since when?
[6984.88s -> 6997.60s]  What are you guys on about? Since when do you need a 70? A 70 is a C minus.
[6998.56s -> 7014.74s]  Did they change the way the grading is done? What do you mean yes? A 60 is a D minus.
[7016.54s -> 7024.19s]  70 is now a D minus. So what's 80? That doesn't make any sense. 70 is a D minus. 80 is a C
[7024.19s -> 7032.46s]  minus. 90 is a B minus. And 100 is what? An A minus? How do you get an A plus? 80 is a B
[7032.46s -> 7050.30s]  minus. What are you guys talking about? Anything below 80 is an F. D is a fair. I'm
[7050.30s -> 7065.50s]  doing this wrong. It's not 10% per letter. I'm being fucked with here. 60 to 69 is a D.
[7066.66s -> 7073.14s]  60 is a D minus. 69 is a D plus. 70 is a C minus. 79 is a C plus. What am I? Are people
[7073.14s -> 7090.45s]  just making me feel? Talk about anything besides school. All right, I'm going to do
[7090.45s -> 7106.70s]  this one now. 70 is a B. No. No, it's not. Whatever. It's not a- whatever. I- I used- I
[7106.70s -> 7110.46s]  was- I was a teacher. I was a substitute teacher, guys. I know how to grade papers.
[7111.02s -> 7132.64s]  I didn't do any grading, by the way. I talked with a fake English accent and would draw
[7132.64s -> 7143.41s]  pictures on the board and stuff. Why am I trying to pay attention? What's with this
[7143.41s -> 7163.18s]  leveling causing my brain to turn off? Lore, you've no- oh yeah, I've talked about that
[7163.18s -> 7173.28s]  many times before. I'm staying over with the fruits. This is a different route this time.
[7173.92s -> 7191.49s]  This is the fruit route. Missed gift. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. You can't prove that.
[7195.47s -> 7204.29s]  Golden fruit split. What a joy of a video game. Can I just- let's be real.
[7205.33s -> 7216.56s]  You know what I mean? Does anybody else think that? I'm so glad that they remade this.
[7218.40s -> 7240.94s]  It deserved it. First crash of the evening of this level, I mean. First crash of the evening.
[7242.21s -> 7250.05s]  That's not true at all. Watch out for the goats. I know you're gonna say that's a dog.
[7250.05s -> 7269.68s]  That is- those are goats. That is a goat face. Much better than last time. Nobody brought up
[7269.68s -> 7276.70s]  any comic book characters. I didn't talk about, like, orchestras. There's no reference
[7276.70s -> 7291.42s]  to shitting. And look at how good I'm doing. Let me take a look. Anything else over here
[7291.42s -> 7305.71s]  I can do? Is this a sponsored stream? Is that even happening? Why would they sponsor people to
[7305.71s -> 7327.28s]  play this? Why else would I play this? No, don't start. Don't start it. You're in the
[7327.28s -> 7338.21s]  middle of doing very well. See? I controlled myself. No, if you're new to the- if you're
[7338.21s -> 7345.58s]  new to the channel here on Twitch, I do not do sponsored content on the channel. That is a-
[7345.58s -> 7366.02s]  that is a guarantee. We're all new. That's not to say I never will for any reason, but I probably
[7366.02s -> 7385.68s]  won't. I cannot see a scenario where I ever would. Is that a money back guarantee? Covering
[7385.68s -> 7391.68s]  his tracks again? Okay, hold on. When was the last sponsored thing you saw on this stream?
[7393.04s -> 7399.17s]  Time's up, because the answer is it's never happened. That's never happened. It's been
[7399.17s -> 7407.46s]  like three years. Sponsored by JetBlue. No, I just said that JetBlue is a fantastic fucking
[7407.46s -> 7412.56s]  airplane company that's quality and I've never had a problem with them. That's not me- that's
[7412.56s -> 7416.48s]  not a sponsorship. That's me talking about a service that I've purchased that I liked.
[7421.89s -> 7427.74s]  Brain fluid. Yeah, but they didn't even pay me. The guy that- the guy that made the company
[7427.74s -> 7437.07s]  fucking- I got like a bunch of weird emails. They were all broken up and it almost like
[7437.07s -> 7442.54s]  there's a lot of typos and shit. He said that the check- it was- it was for 40 grand.
[7442.54s -> 7448.22s]  That's why I did it. And he said it was- it'd be- I would get it within two business days of doing
[7448.22s -> 7456.69s]  the sponsorship. And I- he- I got- it was a little weird because I had to send money to him
[7456.69s -> 7462.13s]  first to like prove that my bank account was be- could be linked to his. So I- I mean,
[7462.13s -> 7478.19s]  I'm still kind of waiting. I sent to get it to work. All right, we've got eight minutes.
[7478.19s -> 7484.80s]  Yeah, I mean, it was two business days and that was, um, was it like a year ago now? So,
[7485.44s -> 7490.22s]  I mean, maybe I got like stuck or lost in the mail or something. And it's weird because every
[7490.22s -> 7495.58s]  time I send a message to that email address, I get back the the mailer like daemon thing,
[7495.58s -> 7499.66s]  whatever it is, the Matt Damon mailer that says the address doesn't exist or something,
[7499.66s -> 7503.02s]  which is weird. I'm trying to get him to send me his new email. I'm sure he will.
[7503.98s -> 7518.86s]  Nintendo, give me it. Oh no, he's getting distracted again.
[7525.49s -> 7547.73s]  Get the cap. Car. All right, this time when I go down, I'm not going back up. Not going down
[7547.73s -> 7551.92s]  there yet. Let me get a couple more things in here because this place I didn't go right over
[7551.92s -> 7566.29s]  here. Okay, now I'm going down. Watch out for the people that are blocking my path. That's
[7566.29s -> 7569.33s]  the only reason why they're up here is just to walk back and forth and be annoying.
[7574.02s -> 7587.95s]  See? All right, no one's. I've got over five minutes to do this. More than halfway there.
[7588.51s -> 7601.31s]  Make sure I don't miss anything. Get the pineapple. Jerma, get the pineapple. Jerma,
[7601.31s -> 7605.41s]  the pineapple. The pineapple. Get the pineapple, Jerma. Jerma, get the pineapple.
[7606.34s -> 7631.95s]  Jerma, get the pineapple. Okay. Jesus Christ. Jesus. Choose. All right. Almost at one meter
[7632.75s -> 7643.34s]  and then it gets easier. What are you? Why do the people have to be just in a fucking way?
[7649.41s -> 7658.45s]  Get away from me. I'm going to get all the radishes and all the fruits here.
[7659.01s -> 7662.37s]  It's just free and it's a lot of space. It gets a lot of space.
[7664.10s -> 7679.36s]  Takes up a lot of space on the actual Katamari. It's very heavy. That's why it takes a while
[7679.36s -> 7686.72s]  to roll it. It's a heavy piece of equipment. Okay. Now we're going to cross this way.
[7688.22s -> 7696.13s]  Pick up a couple of these baskets. Up and across. Here we go. I beat the level. I won.
[7700.10s -> 7706.21s]  Now nobody can pull back this VOD and be like. That's what a lot of you guys do.
[7706.21s -> 7708.61s]  I get to a certain part of the game that I have trouble with and then you just sit there
[7708.61s -> 7729.09s]  and go. Get on stage. Take all this guy's stuff. This is a huge. Come on. 1.5. Almost there.
[7729.81s -> 7743.70s]  This is done. Now it begins. This is the guy that died to Pinwheel on stream. I did.
[7743.70s -> 7756.94s]  It was really bad. I lost like 30 times in a row. I think that evening I think I lost
[7758.30s -> 7764.40s]  six or seven hundred subscribers to the channel because I died to Pinwheel on like
[7764.40s -> 7769.20s]  the 20th or 30th attempt that I remember just like. Chat was. We got a huge argument.
[7769.20s -> 7774.96s]  It was like, dude, you are so fucking terrible. And I went off. Let me tell you something, chat.
[7775.76s -> 7781.54s]  I was talking about like how Pinwheel is hard and like I think the word I used was like
[7783.06s -> 7786.82s]  dumb idiots or something like that. It was like a thousand subs that left overnight.
[7787.46s -> 7812.99s]  It was really bad for the channel. Can I get two? What is your cat? What is Duck Hunt
[7812.99s -> 7817.23s]  Dog doing up there? Yes, I'm going to make references to Spanish Brothers because I've been
[7817.23s -> 7823.50s]  playing it recently. Well, I can't move from here, so a good thing I beat it.
[7840.80s -> 7849.41s]  Still not two meters. Give me the two. Come on. I'm going to grow a little bit higher.
[7849.97s -> 7856.05s]  And then, no, not another level. I got to be close to getting a little bigger.
[7872.59s -> 7891.38s]  You all laughed at me when I was small. And look at you now. What about this guy? Let's
[7891.38s -> 7903.01s]  rip him off the pole. Now I know why Jerma likes this game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's
[7903.01s -> 7909.84s]  really, really funny. That's very funny. That's going to be when Twitch finally does their awards,
[7910.48s -> 7914.72s]  right? You know, you see like the gamer awards. It's like the one. No, eventually,
[7914.72s -> 7919.52s]  I'm going to predict this is the timestamp. And like the next year or two,
[7919.52s -> 7924.48s]  Twitch is going to have its own award show for a bunch of different Twitch related awards.
[7926.19s -> 7929.47s]  It's going to be the Twitch Awards and there'll be a whole thing. It'll do to probably
[7929.47s -> 7935.44s]  TwitchCon. It's going to happen. And when they do that, they're going to pull back.
[7935.44s -> 7940.90s]  They'll be like, best chat joke. And there'll be nominees on screen and you'll get to go.
[7940.90s -> 7946.80s]  You'll be sitting there next to the guy that said resident sleeper. Like he spammed it
[7946.80s -> 7954.43s]  during a boring part of a video game. That one will probably be nominated.
[7969.20s -> 7979.20s]  I don't understand. Santa hat. Santa hat. Ice cube. I don't know. What is this?
[7979.84s -> 7988.88s]  If it were ours, we'd make it much bigger. The thing that you collected the most of is
[7988.88s -> 7999.82s]  vegetables. Oh, I got lots of vegetables. I don't have a better TV and I'm never going to have it.
[7999.82s -> 8005.62s]  I'm never going to download it. I have a bright white background and default emotes.
[8021.74s -> 8024.86s]  I saw him. I saw him outside. He was just standing there.
[8035.70s -> 8038.18s]  King of the cosmos should be in Smash Brothers. Shouldn't he?
[8049.39s -> 8053.23s]  Too big. Oh, that was the Ridley excuse. And we got Ridley. So I don't buy, I don't buy that
[8053.23s -> 8083.39s]  one anymore. Make Corona Warialis. Any other ones we have so far? Make a star six. Let's do the
[8083.39s -> 8095.47s]  Corona. What is it? It still needs something. Is it our royal present? No, something more.
[8095.47s -> 8101.97s]  Oh yes. It's not gorgeous. The sky is not gorgeous at all. A starry sky and it still
[8101.97s -> 8108.90s]  manages to look shabby. It has gone. It has none of the beauteous maximal gorgeousness of our
[8108.90s -> 8127.07s]  crown. What do you mean year? What are you talking about? Can somebody describe what the Santa hat
[8127.07s -> 8134.66s]  emote is? Describe what it is. Oh, it's balding. Amazing, amazing. The earth looks amazing today.
[8134.66s -> 8142.34s]  What's this? Crowns everywhere. It's just a Santa hat. But what does it look like? Is it on
[8142.98s -> 8155.18s]  somebody? It puts a hat on an emote. So it's just, it's a Santa hat that looks like it's
[8155.18s -> 8162.50s]  on top of the emote. Okay. All right, I gotta pick up crowns. Let's roll them all up before
[8162.50s -> 8171.92s]  somebody shows up. Get as many as you can. Super fab gorgeous sky. These crowns must belong to
[8171.92s -> 8176.16s]  someone. There are just too many. If a likely person shows up, we'll make a getaway to the
[8176.16s -> 8186.18s]  great cosmos. In the meantime, we have nine minutes. Hurry pilfering prince. That one felt
[8186.18s -> 8196.00s]  real fucking good. That was a cheeseburger. That was the Burger King. I missed something
[8196.00s -> 8202.08s]  up there. Fuck it. Who cares? We need crowns. Not like baking soda.
[8213.42s -> 8219.63s]  I love the dogs driving the car sharing a crown. What are they moving? What are they
[8219.63s -> 8233.98s]  rolling? They're pushing a can. Why does this have to exist? They're looking for crowns.
[8233.98s -> 8252.13s]  This is going to be annoying. I'm sorry, guys. Hello. Hello. This is the king. Hello.
[8252.13s -> 8264.58s]  Yes, this is Doug. He should have said that. How funny would that have been? Get all the
[8264.58s -> 8284.50s]  swords. I gotta get bigger. Forget about the crowns right now. I have one more. I gotta
[8284.50s -> 8295.04s]  level up. What even is this game? This is Katamari Damacy Rerolled. It's a game where
[8295.04s -> 8299.12s]  you start small and have to roll up any object you can possibly roll up. That's right. You
[8299.12s -> 8304.72s]  can even roll up anything. Everything is roll up-able eventually. You progress through the game
[8304.72s -> 8310.93s]  and you have to make stars. It is a one of a kind. You have never experienced it before.
[8311.73s -> 8323.95s]  Oh, is there a treat waiting for you? Cloud was confirmed. That's cool, right?
[8332.00s -> 8343.28s]  Santa please Santa hat. What? No. Sour please Santa hat. Sponsored stream.
[8345.04s -> 8350.16s]  Next person that says sponsored stream. You are getting free tickets to Disneyland.
[8353.17s -> 8366.98s]  No, you're not. That's a joke. I'm kidding. Oh, did I say Disneyland? Oh, I'm sorry. What
[8366.98s -> 8372.82s]  I meant to say was we're going to go to the website Disneyland. You get free tickets for me
[8372.82s -> 8379.28s]  to show you the website Disneyland. We get to go on a virtual Disneyland tour together.
[8379.28s -> 8383.44s]  That's what I meant. I didn't say you physically were getting tickets to physically
[8383.44s -> 8388.00s]  go to Disneyland. You get tickets to go to the virtual tour of Disneyland on my stream.
[8389.95s -> 8412.85s]  Now I have to do that. I need so many more crowns. Go to the dark house. Scam. I wonder,
[8412.85s -> 8416.05s]  okay, how much would that actually cost? Were there 4200 people here?
[8417.25s -> 8427.49s]  Isn't a Disneyland ticket like fucking 400 bucks? What's 400 times 4200? And what's
[8427.49s -> 8433.49s]  4200 times all the money that would have to be paid for plane tickets? That's like 20
[8433.49s -> 8452.46s]  million dollars. I need crowns now that I've gotten large enough. Go to Disneyland if you see
[8452.46s -> 8457.02s]  a crown, okay? Anybody that sees a crown can scream Disneyland and then they'll, you know,
[8458.06s -> 8469.52s]  you know what I mean. Disneyland. I'm not big enough for that one. I'll get one of the
[8469.52s -> 8478.82s]  guys bumped. I'm not falling off. There are a lot of crowns down here though. But I'm not,
[8478.82s -> 8497.68s]  I can't get up on these. I can barely get them. I believe you owe me some tickets. Get
[8497.68s -> 8517.76s]  bigger. I'm trying. Free tickets to Disneyland. Just get bigger already. Just go to Disneyland
[8517.76s -> 8550.27s]  already. I'm kidding. I know the present is there. What's in it? One of our royal presents.
[8550.27s -> 8570.32s]  It's tickets to Disneyland. Free tickets to Disneyland. When was the last time you guys went
[8570.32s -> 8582.74s]  to Disneyland? Overused joke. We just made it five minutes ago. We just brought that up
[8582.74s -> 8598.56s]  like not even 10 minutes ago. Old joke. When was the last time Disneyland went to you?
[8600.30s -> 8604.14s]  Does it count if you hire like a Mickey Mouse mascot to dance at a Christmas party?
[8604.14s -> 8613.17s]  Not a Christmas party. A birthday party. I only have 30 of these. I need more crowns.
[8614.18s -> 8628.46s]  How did I miss all of them? Christmas party. What kind of fucked up Christmas party is that?
[8629.18s -> 8651.06s]  Can I get these? Ah! Yes! Big crown. That's a huge crown right there and I can't touch it. I hate
[8651.06s -> 8668.62s]  this. I want that. I can't pick that one up. You have one minute left to get. I've got to get
[8668.62s -> 8683.33s]  to 50 right? Or you can't get through there. Why? It's all ruined again. No it's okay.
[8683.33s -> 8688.62s]  He's sponsored by Disney. No. No I'm not sponsored by Disney. No one gets Disneyland
[8688.62s -> 8696.43s]  tickets. It was a reference to a tv show. I was watching a tv show where the host gave out tickets
[8696.43s -> 8718.94s]  to Disneyland to everybody in the audience. It may have been Oprah. 43. It can't be a number
[8718.94s -> 8723.82s]  like that. I will restart the whole fucking level if it's 43. It's got to be like even 45 or
[8723.82s -> 8735.36s]  something. Oh thank god. Someone's coming. Oh we can't open our eyes. It's too dazzling.
[8735.36s -> 8745.66s]  Let's take a look at our rainbow. 45 is not even 44 is. Boy we failed that one. It's all right.
[8747.26s -> 8758.24s]  Well it's 44 crowns. Only a measly 44 so it'll be a bland constellation. Here this is our
[8758.24s -> 8762.88s]  royal present. It's a crown. Guess what? Guess what this is. Alrighty let's just release it
[8762.88s -> 8777.41s]  into the sky. We're still on the same level from an hour ago? I mean that was the same
[8777.41s -> 8788.34s]  area. Different mission. That looked like shit. He said crap. I don't know why I turned
[8788.34s -> 8792.02s]  it into a swear. There was no reason for me to do that. I just transferred what you said.
[8792.02s -> 8804.35s]  They said this looks like crap and I said shit. Thank you Cuman. Cuman gave 10 community
[8804.35s -> 8814.11s]  subs earlier. Thank you Cuman. Appreciate it. 10 community subs. I missed them. I didn't see
[8814.11s -> 8821.73s]  them. But we have to crown them. We can't have the scarf on. That's kind of... Give us
[8821.73s -> 8847.20s]  more slots Valve. What the hell? Yeah we'll keep the crown on. Looks good. Sponsored by Valve.
[8848.16s -> 8863.36s]  Mega Star 6. Let's see what we've opened up. Is that the only one? I think that's the only one.
[8864.00s -> 8876.16s]  This is the end of the game. Level 6. So when are you going to go back to beat Dark Souls 3
[8876.16s -> 8883.97s]  without taking damage? I wouldn't be able to do that for a million dollars. Like for literally
[8883.97s -> 8890.05s]  a million dollars. I wouldn't be able to do it. Have you ever been to the Arabian Peninsula?
[8890.05s -> 8898.21s]  We haven't either. We hope you can visit during the day's rolling. Really? Could you?
[8898.21s -> 8904.46s]  Okay. Could you right now if somebody sat down with a briefcase and said there's a million dollars
[8904.46s -> 8910.70s]  in cash here and it's just ready for you to take it and it's been taxed. It's been pre-taxed.
[8910.70s -> 8915.82s]  So you're fine. Like that's it. It's just cash. But you have to beat Dark Souls 3 without taking
[8915.82s -> 8921.44s]  one hit. Like right there in front of like right there right now in front of this guy.
[8922.48s -> 8932.42s]  That would be easy. Yes that would be dumb not to do it. But how you wouldn't be able
[8932.42s -> 8938.34s]  to do it? It would be impossible. You gave your present away to somebody on earth.
[8938.42s -> 8945.02s]  Must be around somewhere. Roll it up while you're at it. Whoa you guys got real fucking dark.
[8947.38s -> 8952.27s]  It's not impossible. It is not impossible. But what's gonna happen is you're gonna because
[8952.27s -> 8956.03s]  you haven't played Dark Souls 3 in like seven months. You're gonna load it up. Be like I'm
[8956.03s -> 8959.47s]  gonna try. I'm gonna at least give it my first attempt. And you're gonna get a hit by like
[8959.47s -> 8964.24s]  the third enemy. You're gonna be in the graveyard and you're gonna fuck up a dodge because you
[8964.24s -> 8967.65s]  haven't played in a while and you're gonna take the hit. And he's gonna go
[8967.89s -> 8973.97s]  ha ha ha grab the briefcase close it up like see you later fucking loser
[8973.97s -> 8976.61s]  and he walks out it's but it was so close it was right there in front of you
[8977.25s -> 8993.81s]  all right we need a crisp three meters just tackle him i'm sorry about that there are
[8993.81s -> 9001.55s]  30 bodyguards with him like like i'm sorry oh just like steal it i'll take it from him
[9001.55s -> 9012.83s]  okay good luck and these 30 bodyguards are so big that they can barely fit in your
[9012.83s -> 9018.26s]  bedroom like only two of them can fit in your room they're like seven feet tall
[9019.44s -> 9028.62s]  and they weigh at least like a like 290 like to like 350 pounds each and just for just
[9028.62s -> 9034.46s]  because like you lost so you like quickly one of the huge bodyguards just fucking karate
[9034.46s -> 9053.76s]  chops your destiny it crumbles in half why would he do that i don't know you invited
[9053.76s -> 9057.76s]  these guys here you'd say you let you let these guys come into your house okay
[9063.17s -> 9069.68s]  you have to be ready to take the potential like desk chop let me know we didn't well what do we

[9136.51s -> 9144.24s]  you kind of have to it's a series of weird compromises right because i don't want slow
[9144.24s -> 9149.52s]  mode to be impossible to talk but then i don't want the chat just to be like

[9444.54s -> 9461.47s]  does it be i think this is scarier than godzilla i really do because godzilla is a huge scary
[9461.47s -> 9467.20s]  monster and you know exactly what's going on all right scary huge monster came out
[9467.20s -> 9470.80s]  of the ocean and is just breathing fire on us and killing us right
[9474.30s -> 9478.51s]  but this you don't have an explanation for this one
[9479.52s -> 9490.06s]  and that's more terrifying like i can explain king kong somebody if they ask me i can't explain

[10034.67s -> 10039.07s]  you don't think stingray is a fish and i knew i was probably correct that stingray is not a fish
[10039.07s -> 10047.46s]  but you know i didn't want to get ridiculed the same he did this who flattened this like a

[12177.73s -> 12204.29s]  but does the game think it is almost touched a cow that was a cow sign wasn't it whoa whoa whoa

[12212.53s -> 12236.88s]  go through this i'm so nervous right now these are so difficult it's so hard just to ram into
[12236.88s -> 12253.87s]  things so easy to ram in things it's not hard the trees in the way are really starting
[12253.87s -> 12279.34s]  to give me like a panic attack i need to get out of the trees head down this way i can

[12392.45s -> 12410.29s]  is it telepathy do they have esp for god's sake visit and switch cousins i thought i couldn't

[13664.58s -> 13677.17s]  in the first place what is it why i could go over it i can't go back over it
[13678.64s -> 13703.17s]  it's an incline do i really have to restart this we started off well and i got stuck in

[13745.39s -> 13749.79s]  have been a bad idea to go down this way and how does he do it every time
[13768.16s -> 13775.62s]  i really need to be more than a meter right now i can't pick these up either
[13775.62s -> 13783.18s]  i might be completely fucked right now yeah i'm fucked this is i don't think this is
[13783.18s -> 13804.45s]  possible anymore everything here is way too big yeah the game game over because i went down the
[13804.45s -> 13819.87s]  hill no not not not yet don't say that yet you can use your one reset why do i only get one reset

[13897.60s -> 13922.62s]  really am boomer man my hands are like a hurting this is all too far way too far in between i was
[13922.62s -> 13928.86s]  not supposed to come down here when i did it's gonna be close but i might still be able to do
[13928.86s -> 13938.00s]  it chat every time if there was some way i could let you guys collectively control this
[13939.12s -> 13956.53s]  i would that'd be so funny here we go i also might after this level like i'm gonna grab the uh

[14337.09s -> 14344.43s]  just getting stuck on everything i'm too big for my own good
[14347.90s -> 14359.65s]  i'm too big but not big enough to matter up here all the stationary cars get them all all
[14359.65s -> 14369.73s]  of them this is such a great place to be if i could just get this construction equipment
[14370.61s -> 14386.40s]  pick it up come on i need this so bad i'm almost there oh stop being so slow
[14398.35s -> 14409.63s]  just go roll over the whole town now i need that momentum not bringing up for a house

[14486.99s -> 14501.70s]  there's another little area right here come on run them over every person here is dead
[14501.70s -> 14512.18s]  but well it's possible but i don't know even bigger
[14519.33s -> 14530.38s]  in case you were wondering now i'm in the clouds now i'm too big to even understand
[14531.02s -> 14538.94s]  and this is not even close to as big as you can get my game 21 like what else is it for me
[14538.94s -> 14561.52s]  to pick up 22.46 glad we got that one though it's pretty big we imagine it'll
[14561.52s -> 14567.50s]  make a pretty good store if it were ours we'd make it much bigger the most thing you got was
[14567.50s -> 14586.38s]  plants well that makes sense i'm running over dirt green that's it
[14597.86s -> 14598.66s]  i'm gonna mute my mic
[14603.70s -> 14621.58s]  i mean that was that was disgusting i'm trying to drink this is a straw supposed
[14621.58s -> 14624.54s]  to go in this cup but i don't have the straw so i have to suck it out of the top
[14633.41s -> 14640.56s]  i have to drain i have to bite into this like a snake vergo vergo or let's make sure
[14642.62s -> 14651.38s]  you overfill the drink no the drink has a lid on it that a straw is supposed to go through
[14651.94s -> 14655.14s]  like through the little hole but i don't have the straw and i don't have a straw
[14655.94s -> 14662.38s]  so i have to have to drain it through the top it's lacking a certain something
[14662.38s -> 14665.18s]  is it our royal present no that's not it oh yes we get it
[14665.82s -> 14674.22s]  prettiness the sky is not pretty at all it's rough and masculine possibly sweaty what we want is
[14674.22s -> 14686.94s]  pure girlish prettiness there should be loads of maidens like those on earth take the top off
[14686.94s -> 14710.70s]  and drink it like a cup why didn't i do that though i just could i could just take off the
[14710.70s -> 14719.63s]  lid but but hold on hold on let me let me give me i could have some defense here
[14721.02s -> 14724.29s]  i didn't touch anything somebody kicked me down the stairs
[14727.33s -> 14737.50s]  okay listen a couple of days ago i dumped a full entire coffee on my desk 16 ounces didn't even
[14737.50s -> 14741.66s]  take a sip it dumped on the whole thing it ruined this whole entire room it took me like
[14741.66s -> 14746.42s]  an hour and a half to clean it up and i said i will never i'm gonna i'm gonna close
[14746.42s -> 14750.34s]  drinks i don't want to knock anything over and have it spill not never again so
[14750.34s -> 14755.42s]  subconsciously that's why i was doing this rat movie is about to hit a million views
[14756.14s -> 14760.88s]  that's a that's quite an achievement i never thought that i didn't even
[14760.88s -> 14765.81s]  that had that many to begin with took you an hour and a half to clean it up spencer you
[14765.81s -> 14775.39s]  have no idea man it was fucking ridiculous the earth is full of maidens this is another lucky

[17179.54s -> 17193.68s]  okay hold on this might be better no i like the usual controls i like because essentially
[17193.68s -> 17199.39s]  looks like you pretend you have two hands on the ball so your thumbs are your two hands and
[17199.47s -> 17202.75s]  you have to do the motion that with your hands is what you'd be like in real life
[17203.63s -> 17208.03s]  you want to spin the ball to the left you hold off on the right one you spin with your you
[17208.03s -> 17213.10s]  know your left hand you push with your left hand the charging rules the only thing that
[17213.10s -> 17220.51s]  sucks on here yeah the jump is the it's not the uh it's the prince you just jump in the

[19371.63s -> 19381.60s]  to try i have to do this is there identical levels oh yeah but i mean you can redo them
[19382.24s -> 19387.36s]  and that eternal mode is i think you can just do it as long as you want
[19387.84s -> 19402.62s]  um it's a fun game there are a ton of sequels and the sequels are much larger and way more
[19403.82s -> 19405.50s]  going on especially in some of the later ones
[19410.90s -> 19415.78s]  how many catamari games are there i missed one new one
[19419.70s -> 19429.44s]  all right let me try to get a decent beer there are like five new ones what what did i
[19429.44s -> 19446.35s]  miss five new levels a couple games too because i would really love i mean i know they did this
[19446.35s -> 19451.55s]  and this is this is cool but they went back i just fucking uh whatever a bear carving of a
[19451.55s -> 19454.59s]  bear it doesn't even look like a bear on the ground whatever that's the smallest one i've
[19454.59s -> 19460.70s]  picked up so far that is tiny that is the smallest one that's i'm not gonna go
[19478.80s -> 19487.90s]  i buy food and eat it the same day all right let me see what you're talking about
[19488.78s -> 19496.62s]  because i don't think there isn't is this up here the new levels are oh oh what would you look at
[19496.62s -> 19503.36s]  that would you look at that there's a there is a new level i told you the game wasn't over
[19503.36s -> 19513.01s]  make the north star for some reason for some reason i don't feel comfortable at all
[19513.81s -> 19519.07s]  is it because our royal present is missing no that's not oh well that's it we get there's
[19519.07s -> 19523.81s]  no center there is no belly button there is nothing solid in the center of the sky
[19524.77s -> 19532.29s]  that's why it's unstable off kilter undignified and preposterous but we remember now it's the
[19532.29s -> 19554.53s]  north star this level sucks who knows why but make it exactly 10 meters the closer it is to
[19554.53s -> 19560.53s]  10 meters the brighter a north star will be but there's a catch or maybe two how big the
[19560.69s -> 19566.21s]  katamari is to start with nobody knows but we will show you what 10 meters looks like
[19567.17s -> 19578.24s]  ready 10 meters very very simple what when you think your katamari is 10 meters summon us with
[19578.24s -> 19588.61s]  the y button much is expected of you prince of wait what oh shit okay i have to guess
[19588.61s -> 19604.58s]  when it's 10 meters i still have no idea well how wait wait wait how big am i now i'm big
[19604.58s -> 19616.24s]  enough to pick up people so i'm definitely at least two meters right that circle up there
[19616.24s -> 19642.53s]  in the top left is how big i need to look okay how tall a car is three meters three feet so
[19643.41s -> 19652.08s]  three six nine twelve fifteen twenty thirty feet like once i get to what seven eight meters
[19652.08s -> 19672.98s]  every tree close already too much shit once i'm as big as a tree
[19680.69s -> 19707.31s]  hold on too fast come on wait am i i'm pretty big i'm probably five or probably six meters
[19707.31s -> 19748.29s]  right now easy easy easy slow down don't go so fast you're like two meters sure i gotta stay
[19748.29s -> 19770.13s]  next to a tree all right and right now i'm like as big as a tree right now i'm gonna go
[19772.90s -> 19798.86s]  way way too small go away and start over 10 meters 30 feet so i don't really have a
[19798.86s -> 19823.23s]  kilometer to how tall these things are double the size i'm pretty big right now oh shit okay
[19823.23s -> 19847.89s]  i'm definitely 10 meters now how tall is the normal telephone pole because a house that's
[19847.89s -> 19883.71s]  30 feet yeah i know how tall is your house whose house is that that house is like eight
[19883.71s -> 19918.37s]  feet tall i'll kind of turn off the rails here i'm picking up the trees is this size
[19918.37s -> 19932.70s]  contemporary okay yes we're not certain we are not at all sure that's almost eight meters
[19936.83s -> 19951.81s]  rushed it 7.7 that's almost eight that's eight meters oh that's close compact north star
[19953.65s -> 19967.46s]  at least we did it seven meters equals trees that reference image was shitty
[19967.94s -> 19974.38s]  yeah but we probably shouldn't have been going by that image then huh that's c plus yeah you're
[19974.38s -> 19983.63s]  right it is we are exhausted the sky is done the sky is complete we are tired
[19983.63s -> 19991.07s]  rolling the category is very hard right prince wasn't it hard wasn't it well it was hard for

[21731.94s -> 21738.54s]  bombed i've never done stand up i already told you guys about the idea of me going
[21738.54s -> 21742.94s]  to an open mic night and streaming it getting permission to stream it and just seeing what
[21742.94s -> 21755.46s]  happened i'm gonna try to come up with a bunch of material and see what happens when i try to
[21755.46s -> 21766.46s]  entertain a real actual crowd of comedy goers and see how badly i get booed or who knows
[21771.22s -> 21776.80s]  that would be very stressful to watch what if i just did what if i went in there unprepared
[21776.80s -> 21780.72s]  and just tried to make stuff up on the spot now that would be really really hard to watch
[21781.52s -> 21794.86s]  the chat will laugh all the crowd booze we aren't real enough to you no no i mean like comedy goers
[21795.42s -> 21807.44s]  like people in the audience at the comedy club no that's not what i meant that's not what i
[21807.44s -> 21812.83s]  meant you guys know what i meant we're not comedy goers no you're not we're not all
[21812.83s -> 21818.13s]  sitting in a like we kind of are no but we're not at a comedy club and i'm not on stage
[21818.13s -> 21828.74s]  with a mic yes i am there's a mic right here i'm in a digital stage fuck i guess i'm
[21828.74s -> 21839.57s]  wrong i guess that was incorrect just stream comedy night no because comedy night is
[21839.57s -> 21844.69s]  when that came out i was like oh that might be interesting to do and then i saw a couple of
[21844.69s -> 21850.05s]  videos of people just like getting in close to their mics like you get like a one minute
[21850.05s -> 21853.97s]  turn and then you have to watch like eight fucking dickheads come up and be like
[21859.49s -> 21861.65s]  and then it's like all right it was what's happening with the next guy
[21868.56s -> 21870.88s]  then you get your turn again in like a minute and then you try to come up with a
[21870.88s -> 21884.51s]  funny joke and then you get booed he did not peek he did peek the mic did i know i didn't i
[21884.51s -> 21898.03s]  turned it down so no no comedy night maybe at real comedy club comedy night if i ever want
[21898.03s -> 21902.93s]  to publicly embarrass myself for like an hour and no it wouldn't even be an hour that's why
[21902.93s -> 21908.08s]  how would i stream that that would be like a 12 minute stream you only get like six or seven
[21908.08s -> 21912.16s]  minutes when you go on stage for an open mic night you don't get like an hour it's not like
[21912.32s -> 21917.20s]  presenting germa 985 and it's like oh yeah there he is and i come out and get an hour and a half on
[21917.20s -> 21927.78s]  the stage no i get like three minutes i'm gonna go up there and tell like three awful jokes and
[21927.78s -> 21940.78s]  no one's gonna think it's funny and then i'm gonna turn the stream off just put on disguises
[21940.78s -> 21949.47s]  and go more than once and then i'll get thrown out of this comedy club and that would be
[21949.47s -> 21959.34s]  that would be even more embarrassing because then i can never go back there it'll be funny
[21960.30s -> 21970.51s]  all right well sure i'll go get banned from a comedy club on stream that sounds like a great
[21970.51s -> 21977.47s]  time to me i'll get like thrown out and then we can sit on the sidewalk and chat for like
[21977.47s -> 21995.01s]  10 minutes before i get in my uber anywho uh we've got some more bits to go through
[21998.53s -> 22004.75s]  thank you too oh that was tk reaper by the way that with that the stand-up question thank

[22012.30s -> 22025.17s]  2019 one stream one like six hour stream is that enough to be on uh is that enough to be on
[22025.17s -> 22034.30s]  the rumble i'm not so sure it'd be hard to make maybe quiet man made it in the quiet man
[22034.30s -> 22038.78s]  was i mean that was like a four hour stream but that felt like 40 hours of streams so it
[22038.78s -> 22044.99s]  was it's like how i it's like how i feel right that could have been like a 36 hour stream
[22050.05s -> 22054.14s]  maybe he's a great character i think he's hilarious i think he's fun and interesting
[22056.64s -> 22060.40s]  captain worgen thanks for the one dollar why do you call your gamer room an office
[22061.20s -> 22074.53s]  because it's not it's not a gamer room my gamer room no i have because i don't do i

[22179.22s -> 22183.06s]  and then they had to plug in like a bunch of microphones and a bunch of streaming equipment
[22183.06s -> 22187.86s]  and they had to get one of those super 5g bricks that person's still paying like 400
[22187.86s -> 22191.86s]  dollars a month for that i demanded that they get that so they you could see it

[22435.49s -> 22439.09s]  after that why would it why would you substitute teacher be showing you r rated movies
[22444.13s -> 22460.74s]  that's like a call the superintendent scenario cool teacher no you get you pick up the phone
[22460.74s -> 22466.82s]  you dial your superintendent like hello this is superintendent hey what's going on i just
[22466.82s -> 22471.70s]  uh first of all uh i mean i'm a local resident and the first thing i have to say is man wish
[22471.70s -> 22475.86s]  you would cancel uh school when we get all that snow and for some reason when we have like
[22476.42s -> 22480.50s]  four or five six inches of snow on the ground and you don't want to close the schools
[22480.50s -> 22485.38s]  and i have to sit there and watch the local news as every fucking school in the entire district
[22485.38s -> 22490.90s]  goes by alphabetically and see there's that one there's that one and mine gets skipped
[22490.90s -> 22499.23s]  and it's not up there and i have to go to fucking school second of all uh actually

[22560.22s -> 22567.81s]  a good one this is perfect anyway so thank you to uh swiggity swanky for the one dollar
[22567.81s -> 22571.65s]  thank you hands beats for the free bucks what do you think about all this article 13 stuff
[22572.29s -> 22580.75s]  that law passes no one in the eu will be able to watch the stream anymore uh it's that's fucking
[22580.75s -> 22588.37s]  stupid i don't know why everyone's so why is everybody so afraid of the internet you know
[22588.37s -> 22591.33s]  what i mean that's what's been around for so long at this point like are we why are people
[22591.33s -> 22608.62s]  so scared of the internet it's like what what's the problem here it's because they saw the
[22608.62s -> 22621.54s]  spay video now i don't know the the complete and total ins and outs of article 13 but there's
[22621.54s -> 22626.90s]  been shit like that before and this the stuff is already like happening where it's like no no no
[22626.90s -> 22631.78s]  nobody can have the internet right hold on a second somebody hold on a second somebody
[22631.78s -> 22638.50s]  hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you were in you were inside of a mall
[22639.46s -> 22646.58s]  and the mall was playing a song over the radio and in that song somebody said there was a
[22646.58s -> 22653.14s]  sample or there was a there was a fucking sample from a tv show everybody in the mall is under
[22653.14s -> 22665.28s]  arrest well how do i don't understand how are they gonna do that hold on there's an internet
[22665.28s -> 22670.24s]  person on here that just played a song that they don't have the rights to you're all going to
[22670.24s -> 22677.84s]  jail like you know when you're walking around in walmart and they're just playing fucking
[22677.84s -> 22682.32s]  music they're playing like ads and shit you know they think they think walmart has the
[22682.32s -> 22688.72s]  rights to play fucking whatever local radio station is blasting songs through the the pa
[22696.30s -> 22708.02s]  they do they do they actually do i hear like radio stations so mr walmart gets the rights
[22708.02s -> 22731.62s]  to like 10 000 radio stations i mean i i understand people and you know companies wanting
[22731.62s -> 22739.39s]  to be paid for services and stuff and but i don't i don't think blocking and banning is
[22739.39s -> 22744.40s]  the the right way to do it because how are you supposed to share things with people you know
[22744.40s -> 22748.56s]  what i mean like how like you see hey hey dude come here i found this really cool song that
[22748.56s -> 22753.04s]  i want you to listen to take a listen oh hey but uh you gotta pay me first though
[22753.60s -> 22766.38s]  but how you supposed to like share stuff you know what i mean like if you think about it it's
[22766.38s -> 22772.70s]  very core it's people used to sit around and listen to like a record player right
[22773.66s -> 22782.22s]  and now we've gotten so connected that the new record player where everyone's hanging out
[22782.22s -> 22787.34s]  in the room listening to like 30 people all at a party listening to a record you know you people
[22787.34s -> 22794.37s]  are streaming or listening to the radio or playing music or it's a new world it's a different you
[22794.37s -> 22797.89s]  know it's hard to i understand the difficulty in trying to figure out how to go about
[22797.89s -> 22820.26s]  policing it and figuring it out but it's almost impossible where's my money but there's
[22820.26s -> 22826.43s]  i think there's a difference between you know obviously like this dmca takedowns and stuff
[22826.43s -> 22834.08s]  but outright banning websites is just don't we already have systems in place that do this
[22834.08s -> 22840.69s]  shit already don't we already have systems that will take things down or monetize for
[22840.69s -> 22853.82s]  whoever the creator is or do we have to ban entire websites boomers like germa ruin everything
[22865.47s -> 22882.94s]  germa no i don't want to get political here or go any further than that but i think there's i
[22882.94s -> 22886.70s]  think there's a different way you can go about doing that and outright it was it's the same ship
[22886.70s -> 22892.54s]  with like the net neutrality stuff is well uh if you have verizon uh you can't go to netflix
[22892.54s -> 22899.26s]  anymore if you have comcast or you can go to netflix it's just why why does that even have
[22899.26s -> 22916.62s]  to be a thing why could why would that even be a possibility because money i guess i just
[22916.62s -> 22928.16s]  feel like there's a better way oh because of big bits germa isn't even a good boomer he's a left
[22928.16s -> 22941.23s]  for dead 2 boomer a good boomer a left for dead boomer what are you talking about fat
[22948.83s -> 22955.01s]  but talking about stuff like this is a whole can it's a can of worms that when it's opened
[22955.01s -> 22968.02s]  is just there's so much to even discuss there's too much to discuss and i mean we
[22968.02s -> 22975.28s]  could sit here all night and talk about this kind of shit but i hope that uh sensible hope
[22975.28s -> 22981.25s]  there are sensible things that are done and that people don't just jump right to conclusions
[22981.25s -> 22991.10s]  immediately it's just like almost like hey we gotta get to it right now we're gonna do
[22991.10s -> 22995.66s]  it right now we have to change the internet now tonight tomorrow hurry hurry do it do it
[22995.66s -> 23001.74s]  do it we're gonna just go come on it's like this is one of the most important mediums
[23002.62s -> 23008.16s]  in history i think it needs to be treated with a little more let's talk let's figure this shit
[23008.16s -> 23022.30s]  out you know what i mean like the the probably most important thing that's happened in the last
[23022.30s -> 23027.92s]  30 years 40 at least 50 years in regards to technology right the internet especially where
[23027.92s -> 23033.90s]  it is now technologically is just i mean you're talking about like the invention of the
[23033.90s -> 23046.80s]  fucking wheel back in the caveman times as an important politician i'd like to know what
[23046.88s -> 23052.00s]  this internet thing is this is nice background music for political discussion
[23056.02s -> 23057.62s]  i wasn't even listening to it
[23064.10s -> 23066.58s]  yeah this is like didn't fit oh well
[23071.30s -> 23077.17s]  the fact that we are watching this stream right now would blow people's minds back in the 90s
[23077.17s -> 23089.62s]  oh that's what i mean it's such an insane stepping stone for humanity that it needs to be done
[23090.59s -> 23095.31s]  in i think a lot slower a lot different and a lot more people need to be part of the equation
[23097.70s -> 23101.38s]  you know it can't just be like three guys that are like i think this is what it should be
[23101.94s -> 23118.91s]  no you gotta get every more people gotta be fucking involved with that shit but regardless
[23118.91s -> 23134.38s]  of any of this you need to have at least four guys in that room we're gonna we're

[23150.03s -> 23161.07s]  previously said and again i'm i'm coming from a place of somewhat ignorance because i don't
[23161.07s -> 23166.03s]  really know that much about how it is in the eu i mean because i don't live there
[23166.75s -> 23169.87s]  so i don't know how your day-to-day goes with stuff like that i know there's a lot
[23169.87s -> 23176.19s]  of different rules in different countries so i get all i can say is i hope that it's not
[23177.15s -> 23181.58s]  i hope that it doesn't do what it's what it says that people are afraid is going to happen you
[23181.58s -> 23196.34s]  know what i mean because that's a whole can of worms you don't live in the eu
[23198.42s -> 23202.24s]  it would be really weird if i did i'd be streaming at some weird fucking time

[23794.54s -> 23797.50s]  thanks for the one dollar hey germa what movies are you looking forward to recently
[23798.56s -> 23807.92s]  uh the new avengers movie and i would have said venom like a couple months ago but i
[23807.92s -> 23828.59s]  did see venom and i loved that movie i loved that movie i thought it was great i thought it was
[23828.59s -> 23846.96s]  one of the best movies i've seen in like the last couple years 17 on rotten tomatoes
[23852.43s -> 23857.26s]  no all right let me tell you let me tell you the truth here though that movie was
[23857.26s -> 23862.85s]  really really it was really like stupid but i think people were a little too hard on it i
[23862.85s -> 23870.46s]  thought i think they marketed that movie completely incorrectly i don't think that
[23870.46s -> 23877.14s]  movie should have been marketed as oh it's venom spider-man and it's a venom movie no
[23877.14s -> 23882.16s]  you market that movie as like a shitty buddy cop that why would you market that as anything
[23882.16s -> 23903.06s]  else yeah i i mean it was it a good movie in quotes no that wasn't a good movie but i had a
[23903.06s -> 23911.01s]  good i had a good time watching it i think a lot of people were expecting something and yes
[23911.01s -> 23917.90s]  yes i know the movie was supposed to be rated r and then they pulled it to pg-13 and there
[23917.90s -> 23922.62s]  was a lot of scenes that they cut and yeah that's i mean come on are you gonna whatever
[23922.62s -> 23936.93s]  they're trying to appeal to as broad of an audience as they can what wait what's going on
[23936.93s -> 23948.86s]  no stop what what's going on here sony shill what i just told you that the movie was bad
[23949.42s -> 23956.53s]  i just told you it was not a good movie but that the bad movies that are not good
[23957.17s -> 23964.24s]  does not disqualify them from being entertaining you know what i'm saying that you don't a movie
[23964.24s -> 23981.07s]  doesn't have to be good to be worth watching i love watching bad movies yeah i mean like you
[23981.07s -> 23987.10s]  just if if you like venom you liked venom if you didn't like venom then you didn't because
[23987.10s -> 23992.06s]  i mean obviously we can all probably agree the movie wasn't very good so you're correct but
[23992.06s -> 23997.26s]  the guy that liked venom is is not wrong no neither oh no don't spill another thing i
[23997.26s -> 24006.78s]  that's why i had the lid on that's why this fucking lid was on that's why i was drinking
[24006.78s -> 24020.45s]  out of it out of the top like a child fuck venom the movie was stupid but i liked it i
[24020.45s -> 24036.08s]  thought it was funny all right hold on all right it wasn't that bad i'm fine it was just like
[24036.08s -> 24050.98s]  a lot it was a little bit that's why i had the top on in this fucking thing there wasn't
[24050.98s -> 24056.74s]  that much left in it so it went in a very easy blood splat pattern for me to clean up but
[24056.74s -> 24080.96s]  it was still aggravating all right what the hell were we just talking about dude dude drinks
[24080.96s -> 24088.16s]  blood no i don't yes no i didn't mean to say yes i don't drink blood
[24097.04s -> 24102.48s]  that's like my body and brain were fighting my brain was so desperately saying yes and my
[24102.48s -> 24118.94s]  body was like shut the fuck up dude uh all right let's keep going anyways thank you
