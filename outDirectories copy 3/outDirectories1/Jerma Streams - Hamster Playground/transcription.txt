[1.40s -> 6.28s]  Okay, hamster playground it is. Somebody, we were talking about this the other day, right?
[6.28s -> 9.54s]  Somebody in mod chat put this in the mod chat. Let's see, let's see how it is.
[9.54s -> 19.98s]  I don't even have the game installed. This game is 12 gigs? Wow. Well, let's try.
[19.98s -> 29.53s]  We're gonna, you're gonna F a little bit because I'm downloading a game.
[29.53s -> 40.46s]  I just, oh, okay, I won't move so there won't be like a lot of data.
[40.46s -> 113.13s]  40%, 53%, 80%. Yeah, that's the power of fiber. When it works, it's great.
[113.13s -> 118.12s]  I just downloaded a 12 gig game in like maybe one and a half minutes straight. That's it.
[118.12s -> 135.19s]  Back to normal. Okay, so this is called hamster playground. We made the hamster joke before.
[135.19s -> 149.98s]  Hopefully the game's not too loud. Let's just double check that it isn't.
[149.98s -> 157.46s]  Hamster playground. We might actually leave this in 10 minutes tops.
[157.46s -> 215.88s]  Can you see? Okay, I select your house. Why can't you see it? Um, it's like my house.
[215.88s -> 239.26s]  House one. Great. Um, hammy zone. Ham zone to play.
[239.26s -> 248.78s]  What kind of hamsters or their cards to select them? Use arrow keys or WASD on the...
[248.78s -> 252.70s]  Uh, we'll click on the floor and hold the mouse button to move around the house.
[252.70s -> 257.54s]  You need to take care of your hamsters. They need to eat, drink, play, sleep, groom, and poop.
[257.54s -> 272.90s]  You can click on... Okay. Select a hamster and then click on a device to tell them to use it.
[272.90s -> 277.43s]  You can also train your hamsters to make them stronger, more agile, intelligent, or determined.
[277.43s -> 281.67s]  Click the mouse button as fast as possible to reach the green field before the time runs out.
[282.23s -> 286.79s]  Click to stop in the arrow field. Find the cards from the top row. What is this?
[287.43s -> 297.14s]  Oh, what is this? What is so dirty? Do I even have a hamster?
[304.82s -> 337.74s]  It's just my house? Where's the, where's the hamster? What is this? It wants to play a lot.
[337.74s -> 351.56s]  Wait, okay. It's definitely this one. 100%. It likes to play a lot. That's fine. Booty.
[352.76s -> 371.61s]  Clean freak. Was there one on the page? All right, this game just, I thought that
[371.61s -> 395.53s]  it was going to be a realistic game, but now it's like a cartoon game. Um, I don't know. Howard?
[395.85s -> 435.70s]  Okay. Stop. Okay. Easy. Be careful. All right. You want to eat food? What we got?

[500.97s -> 535.75s]  I didn't buy that. Did I? No. Um, yeah, I think so. I don't need to see anymore.
[536.55s -> 543.48s]  I don't see anything else. Why would the hamster have this on? They wear clothes?
[551.26s -> 563.51s]  Hold on. They wear like t-shirts? This is just Winnie the Pooh. Okay. All right. Whatever. Red
[563.51s -> 607.99s]  shirt. All right. Go take a, take a bath and then go use the bathroom. Done? Okay. Quest complete.

[776.95s -> 786.97s]  Nice job. All right. We need, I need intelligence. Wait, is gaming playing, is this an arcade game?
[787.93s -> 851.43s]  Is this it? Dabba dee. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. Level up. Is he tired? No, not, not at all.
[852.63s -> 873.51s]  Not tired at all. In fact, he's having a great time. Is that his brain growing when he's done?
[873.51s -> 885.61s]  When he's like, is that his brain growing? Wait, 20 out of 20. I, I can't get smarter than this.
[885.61s -> 899.64s]  This is as intelligent as I could possibly be. What does that mean? All right. We're going to do
[899.64s -> 929.61s]  intelligence and determination. How are you doing? Still fine. Are you certified with a forklift?
[930.57s -> 943.06s]  No. What happens when I get to level 20 for everything? I get to level up the character?
[943.78s -> 959.77s]  Has it been 10 minutes? No, not yet. Oh, okay. Wait, now. Does that mean? All right. He doesn't
[959.77s -> 966.73s]  want to do this anymore. All right. Let's go. Go jump on the trampoline for like an hour or
[966.73s -> 987.98s]  whatever. I mean, what if you want to do? Oh, I can't afford it. Would you ever own a tiger?
[990.65s -> 1004.41s]  Oh my God. No tiger. A tiger would just one day randomly would be annoyed the way you were sitting
[1004.41s -> 1024.82s]  on the couch and would just attack you. All right. Water deserved. Yeah. The way that you
[1024.82s -> 1030.50s]  lift up your arm to change the channel would be like, let's see what is on. Let's see what's on.
[1030.74s -> 1038.71s]  Okay. Anything would just be like, it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1046.82s -> 1049.86s]  Well, what do you, what would you even, how do you, what would you feed a tiger?
[1049.86s -> 1054.76s]  Just like raw chickens. What do you, what would you do? Is it just like an alligator where they
[1054.76s -> 1059.37s]  just throw like the raw meat in the alligator's mouth? Is it one of those scenarios where it's
[1059.37s -> 1072.44s]  like, okay, okay, take it. And it's like, right. Just raw meat. That's what I mean. Like raw meat,
[1072.44s -> 1077.00s]  like raw chicken, raw, you just like have to sit there and be like, okay, here's a raw steak.

[1090.26s -> 1098.15s]  At a taste for human meat. Well, then you wouldn't last an evening with this cat.
[1101.99s -> 1110.95s]  Get down from there. Get down. Oh, that's it. That's very naughty. Very naughty. Naughty.
[1110.95s -> 1114.07s]  You shouldn't be doing that. You're going to be in trouble now.
[1114.79s -> 1161.43s]  How do I make money? Oh, I need to, I need to paint the walls. How do I get a new floor?
[1161.43s -> 1187.59s]  Where'd he go? Where did he go? You didn't Augustus yourself into the tube again, right?
[1188.81s -> 1226.01s]  Oh, there you are. What do you want to do? It's kind of fun to a race. I have gifts. Oh,
[1226.01s -> 1238.86s]  I can afford clothes, I think. All right. Take a shower and then
[1238.86s -> 1267.11s]  I'm good. Go to the bathroom. You don't want to do that? What do you want to do?
[1267.67s -> 1274.36s]  What do you want to do? What do you want to do? Oh, you're fine. Okay. Okay. So what are we over
[1274.36s -> 1543.80s]  here? Oh, that's how you do it. Can I pee? I'm going to pee. I'm eating a candy. All right,
[1543.80s -> 1576.65s]  let's do it. Let's race. That was a Heath bar. Anybody know what this is? What's this? What's
[1576.65s -> 1599.02s]  that? What is it? Let's check the middle. Fluffy, super delicious nougat. That's a three musketeers
[1599.02s -> 1624.25s]  and it's an S tier. All right. So what do I do? Are there players? Do people play this? Only two
[1624.25s -> 1653.45s]  players? I don't think anybody's playing. You're going to get streams. It's me and Mr. Broom. Mr.
[1653.45s -> 1661.43s]  Broom, you very, very clearly just probably downloaded the game. What do we have to do?
[1662.07s -> 1688.86s]  Wait, it's me versus Mr. Broom. What do I have to do? Tap? What do I have to do? Oh, Mr. Broom,
[1688.86s -> 1712.57s]  you're in deep shit. Now find this card. What? What do I have to do? No, I'm going to get the
[1712.57s -> 1718.60s]  crown. I don't, I didn't understand the games. I actually, I did not understand them. I did not
[1718.60s -> 1730.14s]  get the games. I want like five more Heath bars. So bad. I'll get it this time. Whatever. All right.
[1730.14s -> 1739.21s]  There we go. It looks like people have downloaded the game at this point. Come on. Heath bars to
[1739.21s -> 1755.86s]  Heath bar. Somebody say EO to Heath bar. You are out of your mind. You really are. I ate that.
[1756.98s -> 1766.66s]  Are we good? Click the mouse button as fast to reach the green field. Stop the arrow,
[1767.22s -> 1770.42s]  find the card and click to stop in the shrinking field. All right. Let's go.
[1771.66s -> 1782.12s]  Kill bro, Albert whiskers and Mr. Broom. I'm the strongest out of all of them. How does this one
[1782.12s -> 1827.83s]  work? Tap. What? I'm leaving everybody in the dust. Oh, you're pissed. Nice job, Howard. All right.
[1827.83s -> 1839.61s]  This game I thought was stupid. I was about to just leave until right now. And I've been shown
[1841.75s -> 1850.58s]  that that's, this is a fun one. I was so wrong. I did not think there was like a multiplayer
[1851.85s -> 1879.83s]  like maze thing. That's cute. That's very cute. And it's adorable eating contest. I just spit
[1879.83s -> 1913.35s]  in his, I just spit in that person's mouth. Wait, I don't lose. That's a tie. That we,
[1913.35s -> 1950.44s]  how did we not tie? I spit right into that other hand's mouth. We're good. We're good.
[1950.44s -> 2011.16s]  I eat paper for that. Did I eat paper? I ate paper. Did I eat paper? Sorry. Why did I not click?
[2011.16s -> 2045.19s]  You heard it. Was I playing against another player? I didn't. We're good. I didn't eat paper.
[2045.19s -> 2055.96s]  We're good. I just did not expect that. So I'm just to walk in. Heat bar is so good,
[2057.64s -> 2065.38s]  but don't put heat bar on anything else. None of that bullshit. Just right out of the can directly.
[2066.42s -> 2071.35s]  That's it. I don't want an ice cream. I don't want to just put it like a souffle. No,
[2071.35s -> 2097.59s]  I just want it out of the wrapper. That's it. Are you guys ready? Not even close.
[2144.57s -> 2218.79s]  Oh, wait. I wasn't here. Batman. Oh, that's gross. We didn't see. Good. Worst moment on the stream.
[2218.79s -> 2267.27s]  Why? I was trying to do the Jack Nicholson Joker. It's close. Is this what it looked like?
[2267.27s -> 2287.51s]  That's not what it looked like, right? That's what it looked like. That looks like I don't have any
[2287.51s -> 2303.13s]  teeth. I think I got booted from the lobby. Sorry, guys. This looks like I have no teeth.
[2304.09s -> 2341.45s]  Hold on. I'll show in a second. Fucking click. I swear to God I'm clicking. Oh, come on. Got it.
[2341.45s -> 2382.28s]  Careful. Careful. Oh, shit. This music. You'll never beat me on that. I'm sorry. Jesus.
[2385.42s -> 2391.99s]  Let's get back from the dentist. Yeah, just this new procedure where they take all your teeth out.
[2392.63s -> 2400.36s]  All of them. Yeah, I just got sick of them. You know, I just don't want them anymore.
[2400.36s -> 2406.46s]  I'm really into it. I'm really into soups. You know, getting gummy worms, you know.
[2407.86s -> 2419.10s]  I don't want to eat anything else. Round teeth. I'm going to do one more of these and I'm done
[2419.10s -> 2437.03s]  playing this. This was cute, though. I'm going to try to get Disney Infinity to work for tomorrow.
[2442.09s -> 2460.82s]  I just ate four Heath bars. Is that bad? How many calories are in a Heath bar? Oh, I'm AFK.
[2460.82s -> 2467.29s]  That's my bad. Sorry, sorry. In one of these Heath bars, how many calories in a little Heath bar?
[2468.09s -> 2493.99s]  200? No, it's not. 200? Oh, come on. I'm getting distracted. Somebody just farted a lot.
[2494.71s -> 2510.12s]  It's 210? No, that's in the regular ones. I'm talking about in the small ones, the little ones.
[2510.92s -> 2523.86s]  It does not just eat a thousand calories of candy. 120. It's definitely probably like 110, 120.
[2525.18s -> 2537.90s]  Fun sizes are usually like 100. Yeah. Fortnite Kyle and then Jerma Balls. That was fun. Thanks
[2537.90s -> 2546.58s]  for playing. All of you that downloaded the game eight to nine minutes ago. It was fun. It's cute.
[2547.38s -> 2565.85s]  I'm going to buy some clothes first. Hold on. Dabba dee ba dabba. Wow. I could be so cool looking.
[2576.74s -> 2631.93s]  Here we go. Oh, wow. Yeah. Little mustache and a clown nose. Looks pretty cool. I like it. All
[2631.93s -> 2646.20s]  right. All right. That was fun. What should we do now for a little bit? I could do. What should I
[2646.20s -> 2652.39s]  play for like 30 minutes? I'm not playing Breath of the Wild for 20 minutes. We're going to do
[2652.39s -> 2665.16s]  that tomorrow or Sunday. Maybe I'll add tribes to the list. Turmoil would be about 20 minutes.
[2665.80s -> 2669.40s]  I feel like I'm going to get addicted. That person said that because I'm going to get addicted to it.
[2669.40s -> 2673.19s]  I'm not going to turn the stream off. All right. That was cool. That was a hamster
[2674.39s -> 2687.93s]  play the Disney game. Disney Dreamlight Valley. All right. Let's switch to it. Not that.
