[1.34s -> 12.78s]  Hey, what's happening? How's everybody doing? Getting started a little later than I wanted to.
[12.78s -> 17.50s]  I had to take care of something that was a little stressful, but I was taken care of.
[20.94s -> 26.20s]  Sorry, I'm about 20 minutes past where I usually would like to start, but we're good.
[29.37s -> 36.02s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. We're gonna play Man of Medan. There's in Medan?
[36.74s -> 47.56s]  Medan? I don't know how to pronounce it. With italics. It's gonna be a co-op nightmare stream.
[48.44s -> 58.20s]  So it's gonna be scary. This game apparently sucks. I just want to get that out of the way.
[61.80s -> 68.60s]  But we're gonna do it in co-op. And I heard that doing it in co-op makes the game exponentially
[68.60s -> 80.26s]  more fun. This is a game on choices, on talking to people, on making decisions as a party of two,
[81.14s -> 90.17s]  on who stays and who goes. We're gonna need your help on deciding on who that should be.
[92.62s -> 100.86s]  And at the end of the day, we're gonna do whatever the funniest lab out loud YouTuber storyline is.
[105.67s -> 109.11s]  No, I'm just kidding. The game solo apparently is really, really bad.
[109.11s -> 119.99s]  The game with a friend is apparently very fun. That's what I've heard. So without further ado,
[119.99s -> 123.83s]  we're gonna see if Mr. Italics, you guys all know Italics, we're currently squad
[124.71s -> 134.10s]  streaming right now. If you don't know who Italics is, where have you been? Huh? You don't know who
[134.10s -> 146.92s]  that is? You can probably see the stream right now. But let me move this. Can you see this?
[148.95s -> 153.67s]  I thought this is funny because if you don't know, Italics and I currently live together.
[154.73s -> 166.57s]  And I thought that because we're both on a VPN, that this was our like fake locations. I was like,
[166.57s -> 172.73s]  wow, that's kind of funny. Chinese market, China South Sea. Wow. That's weird how it's routing us.
[174.14s -> 179.26s]  He's like, no, dude, that's like where the game starts. Because it's like multiplayer. I thought
[179.26s -> 189.48s]  it was like, oh, this is where this person's from. I don't know. Chinese market. Like, how do they
[189.48s -> 195.77s]  know? So we're gonna do a new story. What's gonna start? I think we have to pick characters. Play
[195.77s -> 201.06s]  this in co-op. No, no, I'm just gonna, Italics is gonna be in the call and he's gonna watch me play.
[201.06s -> 208.42s]  What do you think we're doing? Why would they show your address? I don't know. I didn't know this
[208.42s -> 217.53s]  took place in China. Yes, my name is Rowdy. My name's been Rowdy for over a year. All right,
[217.53s -> 227.42s]  let's see if we can get Italics in here. Hello. Yes, I am present. Hey, there you are. Hey,
[227.42s -> 234.09s]  everybody. Present and currently accounted for. Yeah, did you push the start button?
[234.09s -> 236.89s]  Oh, I thought I didn't know you were ready. Are you ready? No, I mean like
[238.17s -> 246.78s]  the start squad button. Oh, I didn't. I thought I did that. Whoa. So wait, now there's a squad.
[247.90s -> 250.86s]  Yes, that's what happened when you push the start button. What?
[252.71s -> 261.13s]  So now of course, yeah, I got a custom link here for you. Twitch.tv slash squad. What? Oh, dude.
[263.61s -> 274.23s]  All right, are you ready? I'm ready. I want a, I want a let's go Pikachu. All right, there he did
[274.23s -> 279.10s]  it. Let's go Pikachu. All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, this is important.
[279.10s -> 283.46s]  What do you have on your screen? Do you have anything on your screen right now or is this,
[283.46s -> 290.76s]  do I get to choose this? You choose. Oh, chat, who the hell am I going to do? Personally,
[290.76s -> 298.52s]  I would pick Bulbasaur. Well, there's not a third one. Joe or Charlie, which one of those sounds more
[298.52s -> 307.30s]  me to you? You're definitely a Charlie. Am I a Charlie? What is chat? Why is everybody in chat
[307.30s -> 316.15s]  saying I'm more of a Joe? Charlie Joe. Charlie's are like, which one's more likely to have facial
[316.15s -> 326.12s]  hair? That's definitely Joe. I mean, that's pretty true. Your name starts with J. You should be the
[326.12s -> 330.73s]  one with the J and there's an E in there too. Okay. Oh, there's a, there's the same letter.
[330.73s -> 334.57s]  Yeah. Another, another, right. The same letter. I just, I picked you. That does know the alphabet.
[335.53s -> 341.50s]  I also know how to count. I know the alphabet too though. So that's why I picked Joe. All right.
[341.50s -> 349.14s]  Are you ready? I think you're ready, right? Uh, yeah, I'm ready. So we don't know if there's a,
[349.14s -> 353.94s]  is there like a part where we split up and we have to mute each other in discord? Uh, that is
[353.94s -> 359.62s]  probably going to happen. We are on each other's team when it's beneficial to us and we're trying
[359.62s -> 370.09s]  to hamper each other. I guess when it is also advantageous. Interesting. Okay. Dude, I'm,
[370.09s -> 379.69s]  I'm ready. I hope so. Cause this is what we're doing. There's not a plan B. You know what?
[379.69s -> 384.12s]  I'm not ready actually. If it's this, let's do something else. All right. Which one of those is
[384.12s -> 394.17s]  Joe? Are you Charlie then? That makes you Charlie. I guess I'm Charlie. Whichever person I end up
[394.17s -> 406.73s]  being, I guarantee you that they're both douches. It's too loud. Well, every cut scene is loud.
[406.73s -> 411.37s]  Does this take place in the forties? I thought that this takes place in China.
[413.83s -> 417.11s]  Not that that let go. Does this take place in the forties? No, it takes place in China. That's a
[417.11s -> 428.14s]  time period. Yeah. But that China didn't exist back then. They weren't even on the map. In fact,
[428.14s -> 433.08s]  I think it was Matt Damon who put them on the map. That's the first time I learned of the great wall.
[433.08s -> 436.68s]  I think this is us. You should read up on it sometime. All right. That's Joe. And then which
[436.68s -> 441.40s]  one of these is Joe? I think, um, that's Joe. All righty Buster. We better mosey on back to the ship.
[441.40s -> 449.30s]  You're Buster. Whoa. Buster is just the thing you call your friends. Stop the presses. That's me.
[449.30s -> 455.94s]  Looks like old Charlie Charming's got a little business to attend to. No, that's who's Charlie?
[458.42s -> 462.58s]  Can I fight? Hey, Charlie's on the left. No, this is Mark. He's on the right.
[464.68s -> 470.92s]  Why? Why did I find out my future? All right. This is you. No, no, I don't think any of these
[470.92s -> 483.27s]  people. Yeah, they are. What's in store for me? You are. Is this you? Are you watching me? Yeah,
[483.27s -> 489.99s]  I'm watching you. Are you curious or are you dubious? That's you. This is me. Yeah. I'm
[489.99s -> 495.91s]  punching stuff. Oh, what? I'm curious. I guess I just want to know what you're punching stuff.
[495.91s -> 503.03s]  Will he, uh, I'm over here just throwing. What? There's a training dummy and I'm fighting training
[503.03s -> 508.47s]  dumb. Oh, I thought you were like punching people. No, it's not. You're like, I'm over here punching
[508.47s -> 515.11s]  things. I'm just like, what? I'm getting my like fortune told. Um, all right. I got to turn subtitles
[515.11s -> 520.63s]  up, but I don't have an option to hold on. There was a QTE in my game within the first 30 seconds
[520.63s -> 534.97s]  of the game. Start accessibility. Where are my subtitles? Why are these not on? My subtitles
[535.05s -> 546.22s]  are already on. Okay. Mine are on. Okay. There we go. I'm ready. Okay. I think you have to ready up
[546.22s -> 553.91s]  too. What? Yeah. Cause I paused the game. Oh, I see. So it's like in smite. Yeah. I get, I get two
[553.91s -> 563.10s]  pauses the whole game. All right. Here we go. Hold on. My QTE is getting more challenging. I mean,
[563.10s -> 574.62s]  this is a, this is a really advanced training dummy. What do I see? Uh,
[577.91s -> 581.43s]  what do I see? What are you? Hey, hey, I'm trying to look at stuff. I just got an achievement.
[582.87s -> 587.51s]  I just beat that training dummy. Sure. Better than anybody ever has. You just fucked it all up.
[587.51s -> 591.35s]  I was supposed to look at that and you like grabbed me. You got another quarter on you.
[592.31s -> 596.55s]  What do I look like? Five dollars in 1940s money, by the way. I'll give it a whirl.
[597.19s -> 606.20s]  Just thought you should know that. Wait, now it's my turn. No, I'm getting my fortune told.
[606.92s -> 617.83s]  Oh, this is hopeful. Will Joe return those two quarters? Wait, what? I'm my, I'm asking the
[617.83s -> 621.35s]  fortune teller whether you're going to return the 50 cents. I just loaned you. Oh,
[629.24s -> 638.60s]  it's the smash dummy. I thought he said I can't. All right. I'm no more fucking around.
[638.60s -> 658.98s]  Wait, did you miss one? No, I did not. I missed one. Are you playing with mouse and keyboard?
[658.98s -> 664.02s]  Can I die? What if I die here and Joe's dead? Have a nice day. Why am I playing with mouse
[664.02s -> 667.30s]  and keyboard? I can play with controller, right? Yeah, you can play with it. That's what I'm doing.
[667.30s -> 671.78s]  Hey, Chuck, we better get back to the ship. We don't want to get stranded. Come on, man.
[671.78s -> 676.26s]  Just let me ask another question. We really need to get back. Now you interrupted my fortune,
[676.26s -> 680.52s]  so I guess we're square. Did you see what was on the red tile? Yeah, but like,
[681.40s -> 684.04s]  I'm not the fortune teller, so I don't know what those things mean.
[687.64s -> 695.88s]  Yeah, I don't know. The first one was a flower. I can't hear anything. No, this is the loudest
[695.88s -> 703.37s]  segment in any game. Really simulates what it's like to work on one of these cargo ships.
[704.33s -> 720.20s]  This is so fucking loud. This is way too loud. Oh, did you pause? Guess what? If you alt tab,
[720.20s -> 724.28s]  the game pauses. Oh, you paused it. All right. Well, you got your pause in.
[725.24s -> 731.85s]  There's a five second countdown. Yeah, that's so no one has an advantage.
[732.57s -> 744.06s]  All right, so what's in there? You get three guesses what's in there. Drugs, poison. Really?
[744.06s -> 750.02s]  You're going with drugs? Yeah, drugs, poison. Where are we? We're in China.
[753.30s -> 760.98s]  Chinese statue that the American military stole and somehow gets dumped at the bottom of the ocean,
[760.98s -> 765.14s]  discovered in modern times and curses the people that find it. I can't hear anything.
[767.14s -> 790.02s]  Who the fuck is that? Oh, I failed the QTE. Oh no. So you get to be passed out. I'm going to jail.
[790.98s -> 797.30s]  All right. So we're going to have separate stories here then. Oh, okay. Oh shit. I hit. Did you alt
[797.30s -> 802.90s]  tab? I alt tabbed. Hold on. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Wanted to make sure we were clear who did this.
[802.90s -> 806.10s]  All right. All right. Are you ready? Are you ready to mute each other to go to our separate ways? Or
[806.10s -> 812.39s]  should we just talk to each other? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to mute. You ready? Yeah. Separate
[812.39s -> 823.46s]  ways. He can't. He can't. He's gone. Well, aren't you just going to watch me because you're knocked
[823.46s -> 825.62s]  out? Do you have any choices to make while you're unconscious?
[826.58s -> 828.82s]  Somebody tell him yes, because I can't. I'll alt tab.
[834.65s -> 837.53s]  Don't spoil it. Yeah, we're not going to spoil each other's game. We're going for it.
[841.06s -> 848.26s]  All right. So I'm in jail and he's. All right. So, God.
[852.02s -> 861.38s]  There's poison. I knew it. I'm going to turn this shit down, but I can't pause the game.
[862.34s -> 872.30s]  All right. I'm going to, I need to, I'm going to lower the volume. So what was in there?
[874.30s -> 894.81s]  Uh, ghost gas? Joe, why would you increase the sedation? Why would you do that? Are they asking
[894.81s -> 909.59s]  the questions? I'm going to, I need to lower the fucking volume here. Tal is Charlie. Yes, I know.
[917.48s -> 924.20s]  Yes. Can I help you? Tell him I'm lowering the volume. I know. I know. I know. It says I'm
[924.20s -> 931.88s]  lowering the volume. Are you doing something important? Okay. He'll understand. Now you're
[931.88s -> 936.36s]  ready. Yes. He'll get it. Okay. Wait, wait. I can, I can also have lowering the game volume.
[936.36s -> 940.20s]  So I was sorry. I was, I was lowering the alt tabbing would keep me paused. So I'll,
[940.20s -> 945.64s]  okay. I was lowering the game volume. I suggest you the same thing because it's fucking loud as hell.
[949.16s -> 959.14s]  All right. You good? We're good. We're back. Let's go. All right. So now I got a picture here.
[964.34s -> 970.65s]  What if I take a wicked long fucking time? Use a bind? I know it's too late though to pop.
[970.65s -> 985.06s]  Come back soon. Will he just eventually come find me? Okay. Is it first aid, uh, bin over here?
[985.06s -> 1003.88s]  First aid locker? That was scary. That was fucked up. Is that him? That's not Talos, right? All right.
[1003.88s -> 1010.63s]  Get the mouse off the screen before everybody freaks out. Nobody picks up a key like that.
[1010.63s -> 1017.51s]  All right. Check the fingernails. Are they dirty? All right. They're pretty clean. Actually,
[1017.51s -> 1029.58s]  that one's dirty. Okay. I got a key. Should I like unmute and be like, Hey, I got a key. Do you need
[1029.58s -> 1050.73s]  a key? He's got a pen. Should I move them? Uh, I need to move this guy. I, how do I move the,
[1050.73s -> 1064.86s]  the dentist or whatever this guy is? What the fuck was that? What is, what's this camera angle?
[1068.86s -> 1072.70s]  All right. The graphics are actually pretty damn good. I like the, I like the graphics.
[1072.70s -> 1087.85s]  I like the camera. It feels so, I feel like something bad is going to happen any second.
[1087.85s -> 1102.55s]  Is this me? All right. I wonder if, is it Alex in here? Found him. I had enough time to read
[1102.55s -> 1107.51s]  all the lore. What took you so long? Um, hold on. Just do, do this right now. But if you haven't
[1107.51s -> 1111.27s]  done it, um, and when I mean do this, I mean you have to help me do this. How do I make a key bind
[1111.27s -> 1119.75s]  to mute myself in discord? Okay. Walk me through user settings, user settings. Got it. The key
[1119.75s -> 1123.35s]  binds under app settings is the fourth app settings. Key binds fourth one down. Got it.
[1124.23s -> 1129.75s]  Add key bind top right. Add a key button. Blue button. Got it. Okay. Drop down menu for action.
[1129.75s -> 1135.75s]  Got it. Mute or deafen and then key bind click and then type the key that you want it to be bound to.
[1136.31s -> 1148.68s]  Got it. Hello. I have to, I have to press it again. It's not pushed to talk. Toggle mute.
[1148.68s -> 1156.60s]  It should be working. All right. So did that work? Let's test it. Hello. Hello. We're good. All right.
[1156.60s -> 1160.92s]  I'm ready. Uh huh. You're good. Okay. You did it. That was, that was a fast turnaround. Honestly,
[1160.92s -> 1164.28s]  I probably made discord tech support look bad. Probably did. All right. Here we go.
[1166.15s -> 1169.59s]  Professional streamer. When did I ever say that? I'm just a fucking guy, man.
[1179.53s -> 1184.15s]  Oh, right. I found a fucking body. Well, you, somebody just told you that. It's okay.
[1184.95s -> 1189.86s]  All right. So here we go. Are we controlling this? I believe we're controlling this. Oh,
[1189.94s -> 1194.10s]  come on. Come see the body. There's no punch book. Okay. Sorry. I didn't do that. I did.
[1194.10s -> 1201.42s]  I did that. It's like, goddamn it. Another pause.
[1203.82s -> 1207.26s]  I was pushed. I honestly, I was pushing every button to see if I could punch you before you
[1207.26s -> 1229.03s]  punch me. I love this. Can you get in like really close? I'm not already like getting closer to the
[1229.03s -> 1250.07s]  camera. Waiting in an elevator. Oh, QTEs. Press A to keep calm. Press A in time with the heartbeat.
[1250.07s -> 1261.00s]  Oh, it's a, it's a rhythm game. Okay. Do we, um, does that two or is that the way it is? It's just
[1261.00s -> 1277.06s]  two. I am manually beating my own heart. I knew you were going to fail. How did I fail? I knew it.
[1277.62s -> 1287.94s]  What? Look what you've done. That's the first L of L moment of the stream. I, but how did I
[1287.94s -> 1298.52s]  fail that though? Did I press A again? Maybe I just, I don't know. That was weird. Oh, lol.
[1299.40s -> 1312.84s]  That was a funny moment. That one's going in a YouTube video. Is that open? I feel like you and
[1312.84s -> 1318.04s]  I just woke up from getting our wisdom. Who did that? I didn't do that. I didn't, I didn't do that.
[1318.04s -> 1322.12s]  Pause by Talc says in the top left. That wasn't me. I just, I'm the first one that said I didn't do
[1322.12s -> 1330.54s]  that though. What happens if you push right bumper on the controller? Me? Nothing. That's all I did.
[1330.54s -> 1335.50s]  I pushed right bumper. That's what I, dude. All right. Well, we're currently walking around in post
[1335.50s -> 1343.13s]  dentist days. We both just had our wisdom teeth taken out. This is where you freed me. Um,
[1345.21s -> 1348.81s]  I'm like, wow. Can you, how can you, can you come back over here?
[1349.85s -> 1356.62s]  You're stuck over there, aren't you? Do you have your own camera now? Yeah. Do you? Yeah. Oh, okay.
[1359.77s -> 1366.25s]  Where are you? There's an, oh, there's a note and there's a note and stuff. I read those already.
[1366.25s -> 1373.30s]  They're meaningless. Are they meaningless? All right. Well, you are direct. You can like relay
[1373.30s -> 1378.92s]  this info to me later. Did you take whatever? What's the, what about the safe? Uh, it's locked.
[1379.56s -> 1384.65s]  All right. Most safes do. All right. So we're going to get the combination. I have no means
[1384.65s -> 1391.77s]  to open it presently. There was also the body in my room. There was a box behind the body.
[1391.77s -> 1402.34s]  Just making sure you know that. Um, where did you go? I'm looking at, um, your childhood photos.
[1402.98s -> 1407.78s]  Use the key key. What do you mean key key to a safe? It's a dial. What are you talking about?
[1407.78s -> 1416.54s]  Is it a dial safe or is it a key lock safe? Oh, are we getting secret spoilers? What the
[1416.54s -> 1428.20s]  fuck are you guys talking about? I found the guy you killed. I didn't kill anybody. I mean, you,
[1428.20s -> 1433.78s]  you went to the infirmary. This is the doctor. It's a dial. So I'm just putting two and two together
[1433.78s -> 1437.70s]  here. Everyone was screaming at me. They put the key in the safe. Have you guys ever seen a safe
[1437.70s -> 1446.58s]  before? Why would I put a key into the same? Oh, they just scared the shit out of me. I thought,
[1446.58s -> 1453.86s]  okay, yeah, I thought that was me, but that was you. All right. Who ever designed these things
[1453.86s -> 1459.72s]  to probably go back to engineering school? I don't, what was down where you were the body?
[1460.36s -> 1466.68s]  Why does right bumper do that? Maybe right bumper is put on pause. Maybe you have it as like a left
[1466.68s -> 1476.68s]  click or something from like a bind key or something. Use the key on the door. I did.
[1477.94s -> 1487.77s]  What door? I think I found something. Why would they give me full motion control of the face?
[1493.10s -> 1503.62s]  Is that you making the noise? What the hell? I don't know what I'm what the helling right now.
[1503.62s -> 1507.62s]  I can't see what my character sees. I see you sneaking up on me though.
[1509.74s -> 1519.14s]  You said, what the hell? What did you? Yeah. What did you? What the hell? Man. Oh my God. Door.
[1523.08s -> 1528.31s]  You guys are a couple of mouth breathers. This looks like poison gas on the ground.
[1529.59s -> 1534.49s]  What was that? Did you see that? No, there was a kid. You didn't see what you didn't see that.
[1535.29s -> 1539.77s]  Was there a kid? Holy shit. How did you not see that? This guy was you go. I'll go first.
[1539.77s -> 1546.09s]  No, you go first. I mean, I want you to be able to see the kid. Take a right. There's a flashing
[1546.09s -> 1549.77s]  thing at the end of the hall. Yeah. But the kid went to this way. Listen, horror game kids never
[1549.77s -> 1553.85s]  stick around for more than at least a second at a time. That's true. That's true. They are only on
[1553.85s -> 1562.54s]  screen for about a tenth of a second. What is that? Hey, Joe, help. Oh, never mind. We should
[1562.54s -> 1573.27s]  have gone right. This is main story area. Press the repeatedly on the door. Metallics failed.
[1574.31s -> 1581.03s]  What do you mean you've failed? Listen, I want to see the kid now. What? He could be over here
[1581.03s -> 1590.65s]  still. All you had to do is press a. Oh yeah. That's what y'all you had to do to hold your
[1590.73s -> 1598.87s]  breath when the guy with the gun was walking down the hall. Funny coincidence. Let me try this one.
[1598.87s -> 1605.35s]  We try to get it here. Hey, Charlie, I'm gonna need your help over here, man. All right. Ready?
[1610.54s -> 1625.86s]  Am I dead too? I think we were supposed to scream. No, that wasn't that wasn't scary,
[1625.86s -> 1630.98s]  though. That could have been just somebody saying like, hey, I guess that would be kind of startling.
[1631.86s -> 1636.87s]  Well, we have to examine that. No, everybody's dead on the ship now.
[1637.96s -> 1643.00s]  Except us, because aren't there like 35 playable characters in this game?
[1643.80s -> 1652.60s]  That might be the free to play version. Who's the lucky winner? They're turning into a mobile.
[1652.60s -> 1674.12s]  Wait, something over here. Oh, I need to walk. Every character in this game has died.
[1676.55s -> 1681.66s]  I'm going down these stairs like my grandfather. This is how my grandfather goes downstairs.
[1688.17s -> 1695.83s]  All right, I'm down there. Do you think you're gonna come downstairs? I'm trying,
[1695.83s -> 1701.67s]  but the camera reverses and it made me change the forward backward. You're gonna let me go
[1701.67s -> 1706.79s]  downstairs because I just see both of our feet. All right. There's a room over here.
[1707.51s -> 1715.82s]  Can we go in here? I physically can't see anything. This looks like a no. Is there a door
[1715.82s -> 1725.02s]  right there? No. This floor is old LB to walk faster. Is that true? It is very true.
[1725.74s -> 1731.45s]  So, uh, is it just me or are you getting a real strange feeling right now?
[1731.45s -> 1734.01s]  Do I look like a guy who likes to talk about his feelings?
[1734.01s -> 1739.37s]  Oh, there's like everybody's dead. Tough guy. What do you mean strange feeling?
[1739.37s -> 1746.14s]  Everyone you've guys have come across are dead. Yeah, we found three bodies so far. Something
[1746.14s -> 1749.66s]  weird going on here. You're getting a weird feeling about this. Like three people are dead.
[1750.46s -> 1755.02s]  So strange. We're in the military and we see dead people all the time, but this is different.
[1756.46s -> 1770.60s]  Hold three. I found a, I found a dentist in the, in the cabinet, but you get a weird feeling about
[1770.60s -> 1777.77s]  something here. There's the kid. There's the kid. There's the kid. You see that kid over there?
[1777.77s -> 1796.73s]  What kid you're talking about? Oh, so you do. Oh, so I must be the telepathic one. He was over here.
[1796.73s -> 1806.01s]  You guys get a weird feeling about this. What happened in here? Somebody just really likes
[1806.81s -> 1817.37s]  mannequins and posing them. Who's got the gun? I think I have the gun. You have the brass knuckles.
[1820.76s -> 1835.53s]  Wait, where'd you get a knife? Oh, you're going to backstab you.
[1837.53s -> 1866.71s]  Oh shit. Are we still together? I think so. Come here. What happened to you? What happened?
[1867.67s -> 1872.39s]  What are you like? I'm not doing anything.
[1874.07s -> 1886.25s]  Are they saying mute? I think we're supposed to be muted. All right. Mute.
[1887.45s -> 1894.92s]  Wait, what? I didn't want to do that. Holy shit. I didn't want to do that.
[1895.96s -> 1901.86s]  Why did I do the pro? I thought it was like, I thought it was going to go over there and like
[1901.86s -> 1921.21s]  open the door. What? Hey, anything weird going on? Something weird going on? Yeah, something
[1921.29s -> 1930.94s]  happened. A Tommy gun wielding man with a man fuchu just, uh, just shot me like a lot. What?
[1931.82s -> 1969.32s]  Hold on. I, so who do we, what the hell is that? Monster. Oh shit. Why do I have to get the mud
[1969.32s -> 1979.02s]  bumpers this small? If only I had one that was even 5% bigger. I'm going to do like a scratch.
[1979.74s -> 2006.95s]  Oh, the misty mountains go. Is that the first chapter? I think that was the tutorial mission.
[2007.67s -> 2013.66s]  I learned a lot about the nature of companionship and friendship
[2016.38s -> 2022.62s]  and who should have a weapon taking point against the monster.
[2023.58s -> 2028.62s]  Um, well, you see what happened on my screen was you were a little kid
[2029.82s -> 2034.22s]  and you shot the kid. I shot at the little kid. Well, no, you weren't a little kid. I didn't know
[2034.22s -> 2040.86s]  where you were. And the little kid ran away. And then I, I shot at a device that I didn't know I
[2040.86s -> 2046.30s]  was shooting by the way. I thought I was going to go over and open the door, but I ended up shooting
[2046.30s -> 2056.41s]  into the thing that. Yeah, that was me. I don't know, but I, I don't know. You killed me though.
[2057.21s -> 2061.06s]  So that's one for you. One point for you. One point to Gryffindor.
[2064.63s -> 2072.07s]  Oh no, this is supposed to be the anthology intro, right? Yeah. We're doing, we're going to kill the
[2072.07s -> 2081.88s]  other stream of the mouth. He's going to go like, welcome to, uh, castedly tales of death and
[2081.88s -> 2095.43s]  destruction and decay. Our next story. That's what's going to happen. I'm fucking lost.
[2097.50s -> 2101.26s]  All right, but what if the credits just rolled and we were back to main menu?
[2103.29s -> 2113.38s]  Uh, if the credits just rolled right now, that would be bad because that would mean that
[2114.87s -> 2125.59s]  we spend that much money. That's true. It's going to open. Here it comes. A man and his wife spend
[2125.59s -> 2131.59s]  an evening on their anniversary. Here we go. Yep. And if Madonna's filmed in front of a live studio
[2131.59s -> 2151.82s]  audio, he's holding that close to his face because he can't see it's BF Bugleberry.
[2157.00s -> 2166.84s]  I am the curator, the curator of stories, stories of love and hate, greed and beauty, life and death.
[2167.64s -> 2175.86s]  Stories such as this one. I'm here to record the story you choose to tell. You see, this tale is
[2175.86s -> 2181.54s]  only part written and the choices you make will complete it and determine whether the lives of
[2181.54s -> 2189.14s]  those with whom you are interfering continue to flourish or whether they are snuffed out.
[2189.14s -> 2192.50s]  See, I got all a writer's block recently. You're going to have to help me out to write the rest
[2192.50s -> 2197.78s]  of my story. Decisions according to our own moral. Am I getting paid for this? And we have to live
[2197.78s -> 2203.32s]  with those decisions. Unfinished stories. But you shouldn't fear death. That was just something
[2203.40s -> 2210.36s]  Telltale did. Inevitable. It is the tax one pays for having lived and it comes eventually.
[2210.36s -> 2215.88s]  Oh, taxes, taxes. What the fuck, taxes? None of us want for it to come too soon,
[2216.52s -> 2224.18s]  do we? Sometimes you will be determining a story together, sometimes separately.
[2224.18s -> 2228.66s]  So make sure you mute. So one of us may not make a complete sense to the other because we all have
[2228.66s -> 2236.18s]  different perspectives. As in life, the actions you take matter. The choices you don't say it
[2236.18s -> 2243.62s]  will don't say it. He already did. I'll be a close eye on your progress. It's not my place
[2243.62s -> 2249.78s]  to interfere, but I might be persuaded to offer the occasional hint. Here's one for free. There
[2249.78s -> 2255.30s]  are pictures in this world that can show you some possible future. It's just a really elaborate
[2255.30s -> 2260.98s]  escape room. You can find them and study them. They may just help you to make better decisions.
[2262.58s -> 2271.46s]  Or should I say decisions that result in outcomes you would prefer? We'll talk again
[2271.46s -> 2276.58s]  soon enough. We'll have the opportunity to account for all the actions that you've taken.
[2276.58s -> 2287.54s]  Do you know where Zoomer haircuts come from? I don't know. Justin Bieber? Have you ever seen
[2287.54s -> 2298.33s]  Brad Pitt in Fury? No. They have military cuts like that. I thought that was Justin Bieber.
[2298.33s -> 2304.81s]  Justin Bieber did that, right? No, Bieber had long hair and then he had short hair.
[2306.01s -> 2318.22s]  But the Bieber is like, I don't get my hair cut. Oh, so me. I have a Bieber. Witty Brad.
[2319.02s -> 2324.06s]  Okay, you're Brad. Brad's motivated. Wait, are you seeing this? Yeah, I'm seeing this.
[2324.06s -> 2335.34s]  Got a couple of brews. Motivated Alex. Wait, Brad. Brad's brother. Julia's boyfriend.
[2336.06s -> 2341.34s]  Are we both that stupid that we couldn't figure that out together?
[2342.22s -> 2346.14s]  So, hang on. Does the guy with glasses not have a significant other?
[2346.70s -> 2353.62s]  The water. Diving. Maybe you can show me how the pros do it. You don't have 20-20 eyesight.
[2353.62s -> 2364.33s]  You're not a Chad. Encouraging, annoyed. I get to read your mind here. Say nothing.
[2367.82s -> 2372.22s]  We get to be like the guardian angels watching over our two people that we're protecting here.
[2373.02s -> 2376.38s]  Like you and I eating popcorn. Like, hey, you're his guardian angel. I'm his.
[2377.02s -> 2387.50s]  What's he gonna say? Oh, easy. Be cool. What? Julia and Conrad are, you know, how do I say it?
[2387.50s -> 2393.10s]  Super fucking loaded. So? Don't sweat the little stuff, man. It's not cool. Don't make me regret
[2393.10s -> 2398.06s]  letting you tag along. Why'd you choose saying nothing? Because I didn't want to fucking start
[2398.06s -> 2414.92s]  a problem. Tag along? Seriously? I thought I was invited. All right, amigo. Calvary's
[2414.92s -> 2420.36s]  almost here. Cool. Sorry I'm a little snappy. I'm just a new medical school would be stressful,
[2420.36s -> 2425.64s]  you know? Total shocker. And man, the long distance thing. Julia, it's been rough.
[2428.41s -> 2440.30s]  It's been like two weeks. Okay. Yep. Right on cue. What? Conrad doesn't think we have enough.
[2440.30s -> 2447.10s]  What if we both just do silence each time? We don't communicate the entire time.
[2447.10s -> 2455.99s]  Relationship updated. What's in there? Oh, it's got a seed box. So, uh, can I get your input on
[2455.99s -> 2461.56s]  something? What's in there? Yeah, what? Just, uh, kind of a big thing I'm trying to make a decision
[2461.56s -> 2467.00s]  about. What's in the seed box? I don't know. That was weird. It was a device or something.
[2467.72s -> 2471.88s]  Kind of a big life choice, you know? Is there something under the carpet? I don't know what's
[2471.88s -> 2486.04s]  the right thing to do. Go with your gut. Okay. If it's right, you'll know. We're giving each
[2486.04s -> 2492.68s]  other advice. Yeah, that's changing our, uh, direction wheels. Julia, reckless. Conrad's
[2492.68s -> 2500.14s]  sister. Conrad, Julia's brother, relaxed. Foolhardy. I think I recognize that guy.
[2500.86s -> 2511.99s]  Sorry. Connie, this is Alex. Hey, what's up, man? Conrad. Watch it, sis. Lady killer.
[2512.47s -> 2519.43s]  I recognize him too. Yeah, that's somebody. Who's that? Is that the dude that plays Iceman in X-Men?
[2534.01s -> 2539.45s]  Wait, why are you deciding what the- What are you deciding?
[2539.45s -> 2541.45s]  I would have gone with minutes, way less needy.
[2543.13s -> 2547.13s]  So, first dive, you and me? I imagine you two over there doing the same thing.
[2553.51s -> 2567.46s]  I get a better view when I'm behind. What? No. Warmer back there too. What? Oh, here come the
[2567.46s -> 2575.22s]  other characters. Why did you puke? Why did you- Where's the old crust bucket skipper anyhow?
[2575.22s -> 2580.98s]  Why did they do like the puke thing? Impatient. Captain of the Duke of Milan. Courageous. Okay.
[2581.86s -> 2596.10s]  I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but- Awkward. Ready to go? How come I didn't get a
[2596.10s -> 2601.38s]  beer? Because he asked me- Conrad asked me if I wanted one. Why didn't- Because we're cool now.
[2604.23s -> 2611.48s]  What do you- What do you got? What are you selling? What the hell is going on? I don't know. You
[2611.48s -> 2616.46s]  wouldn't say, hey guys, like sit down. You're going to hurt somebody. That's a lawsuit incoming.
[2617.02s -> 2625.27s]  All right, who's dead first? You want to just pick one and just like just that's it? Like,
[2625.27s -> 2630.71s]  okay, let's just pick who cares if we like them or not? Like we're going to try to- I was saying,
[2630.71s -> 2634.55s]  let's guess who's going to die first, but you want to like pick someone to kill. I thought that-
[2636.39s -> 2643.10s]  You want to go lie down? Yeah. You know, maybe I should. Because I vote for myself.
[2645.82s -> 2655.85s]  I vote for the guy that fell down. All right. Mute. Over here. That's pretty far out of the way.
[2656.41s -> 2659.69s]  I'm just thinking about backup targets in case we don't find anything on the dive cam.
[2659.77s -> 2663.69s]  Listen to me. I've never heard of this wreck you're looking for. Usually these things are
[2663.69s -> 2669.77s]  crawling with divers. Yeah, this one's different. I'm just saying if it gets too late, I know some
[2669.77s -> 2678.54s]  nice places where you can just take, you know, a nice dive. A nice dive. Um, Brad did his homework.
[2678.54s -> 2684.14s]  Who was that? Was that Italian? Okay, look, you're the client. I'm just saying we don't have unlimited
[2684.14s -> 2697.27s]  daylight. I'm going to go help Conrad and Julia with the camera. What you got? What you got?
[2698.50s -> 2704.66s]  Feast your eyes on this. We found a plane. A plane? Brad's calculations were right on the money.
[2704.66s -> 2710.98s]  Always bet on Brad. Kid's a whiz. We should thank him. You gotta, you gotta keep that person
[2710.98s -> 2716.18s]  around. We are ready to dive. They waited until they came out here to find- Technically, we should
[2716.18s -> 2722.90s]  call this in to port authorities as an unreported wreck. Well, technically. Are you sure you don't
[2722.90s -> 2734.01s]  get any money? Do you want money or not, bro? We could be rich. Wait, are you saying we shouldn't
[2734.01s -> 2744.95s]  dive? Can't dive? What the fuck? Um, fine, you don't want to dive? Okay, let's not dive then.
[2744.95s -> 2751.11s]  Guys, look, I think we gotta listen to our experienced- No, I wanted to dive. Oh, I see.
[2751.11s -> 2756.71s]  I'm sucking up right now. I see. What the hell? Wait, what?
[2756.71s -> 2763.91s]  What? No, no, no, it's not. I'm just saying she's right, not because she's beautiful.
[2764.63s -> 2768.87s]  I mean, she is beautiful, but that's like a coincidence. I feel like I'm watching- She's
[2768.87s -> 2775.11s]  the captain. Look, we paid for this dive. Generously. We're diving. We're diving. To the client.
[2776.70s -> 2783.67s]  But if anything goes wrong- I just can't wait to be the first one down there. Can you imagine?
[2783.67s -> 2790.15s]  Untouched? First to die. God, I just can't wait to be the first one to go down there and
[2790.15s -> 2795.27s]  guarantee the dive. First. I'll set up the tanks. The boys will do the final checks.
[2796.07s -> 2800.79s]  Take a look at the camera. See if you can find anything useful. Righto. He looks right over into
[2800.79s -> 2814.54s]  the lens, like in this camera. He's like, hey guys. I believe we're back. Hey, hey. Hey, sweetie.
[2814.86s -> 2831.69s]  I think we're in good shape. It's probably not a bad idea for you to have a clue how these things
[2831.69s -> 2837.45s]  work. Gotta say, not too happy with our captain at the moment. Did you see that? They see what?
[2839.77s -> 2843.37s]  Seriously, where does she get off bitching about? What is that? She's making a small fortune on the
[2843.37s -> 2847.13s]  street. I don't see anything. Yeah, not that small. I don't know if that's like a bug or if it's
[2847.13s -> 2851.69s]  supposed to disappear when I look directly at you. All right. I'm going to get these
[2851.69s -> 2866.17s]  rebreather set up. Why? What are you laughing about? This is just ridiculous. All right. Are
[2866.17s -> 2874.95s]  you right? And then we'll go through the final steps together. Cool. Just holler at us when
[2874.95s -> 2880.79s]  you're ready. Don't pick up the binoculars. She's in the frame. Don't pick up the binoculars.
[2881.91s -> 2885.67s]  It's a waste. Maybe you'll see something I don't. I don't know. Wait, didn't you say what the heck
[2885.67s -> 2894.36s]  was that? Yeah, I was like a game glitch. Game glitch or did you see something? That kind of
[2894.36s -> 2929.86s]  question will get somebody killed. This is out of focus. Oh, what was that? Did you see the thing?
[2931.98s -> 2938.26s]  No, I'm looking for the sun to look directly at it. It's not here. I didn't see anything.
[2939.06s -> 2954.10s]  The first impression on the lovely Fliss. Okay, now three, don't call her the she's a person,
[2954.10s -> 2959.06s]  not a thing. And four, do you ever even think about anything else? Hey, ladies got a thirst
[2959.06s -> 2964.90s]  and I'm here to quench it. And what's with all the numbers? Oh, yeah, I forgot. Bro's afraid of math
[2964.90s -> 2969.62s]  and that's fine. Gotta say trying to like get into your conversation. I saw that.
[2969.62s -> 2979.38s]  Wait, no, I can't pause on my side. Well, I will never push this button. The next time I push this
[2979.38s -> 2987.02s]  button, I will uninstall the game. It's RB. RB? Arby's? That sounds good to me.
[2987.82s -> 2991.58s]  We paid top dollar to come out here in the middle of nowhere to do whatever he wants
[2991.58s -> 2995.58s]  without any namby pambies breathing down our neck. Is RB's good? Have you ever had it?
[2995.58s -> 3001.02s]  I'm serious, Connie. All right, I'm gonna get these rebreather set up. 29 degrees,
[3001.02s -> 3009.10s]  they do in Celsius the same, America. Is this? No, this is China. Are we still in China? Are we
[3009.10s -> 3020.76s]  still supposed to be in China? Do you know how to use that? Not really. Wanna just let it do its
[3020.76s -> 3032.79s]  thing. I'm just like turning. What? I just got like a QTE when you came over and said slam dunk.
[3032.79s -> 3039.11s]  Oh, captain, my captain. Slam dunk. You know, we have rules out here for a reason. You guys gotta
[3039.11s -> 3043.83s]  respect that. At least you showed me a little respect. I'm stuck in here. Even if you're the
[3043.83s -> 3054.38s]  only one in the group. One of my options to speak is I like it when you're strict. I didn't catch
[3054.38s -> 3058.06s]  that. Hey, I like it when you're strict. Sometimes I just want to be kept in line. You know what I'm
[3058.06s -> 3062.62s]  saying? I don't mind a little submission now and then. Is there no way for you to turn that off?
[3062.62s -> 3067.50s]  Turn one off. That thing where you have to hit on me like every two seconds. Somebody wrote this.
[3068.78s -> 3072.89s]  I'm just standing next to you. Can I be like, hey, dude, you're a fucking annoying person.
[3072.89s -> 3077.53s]  So is it working? Do you have brain damage in my upstairs brain or my downstairs brain?
[3079.75s -> 3083.91s]  I have to tell you. I can't leave. I'm getting a little concerned about the cavalier nature of
[3083.91s -> 3089.43s]  this dive. These rules are all pretty basic stuff. I look left and right. How much experience do you
[3089.43s -> 3095.03s]  have with these kind of dives? Oh, you're in this? Yeah, I stood right next to you.
[3097.19s -> 3100.47s]  Why are you in this conversation? I've done a couple of wrecks over the years.
[3100.47s -> 3105.59s]  So you heard all that. You know, experienced. If this is your first unreported wreck, then you
[3105.59s -> 3111.75s]  should know there's a very specific protocol you have to follow. For all you know, this could be a
[3111.75s -> 3123.62s]  war grave. Disturbing it would be illegal and immoral. How is it immoral? I love just the wheels
[3123.62s -> 3128.34s]  turning in your head. You know, you're even more intoxicating when you're angry. And I am ready to
[3128.34s -> 3134.02s]  get wasted. You have literally never spoken to a woman before in your life. Have you? No. Hmm.
[3134.90s -> 3142.36s]  It shows. No. No. Hey, come play with this thing. It's cool. He's very confident for someone who's
[3142.36s -> 3147.88s]  never spoken to a woman before. Wait, something down there? No, there was a computer. Wait,
[3147.96s -> 3165.66s]  didn't the guy say? Look at the pictures. This is a fake license. I don't know what that was.
[3167.18s -> 3178.79s]  They misspelled height. Height is misspelled? Yeah, H-I-G-H-T. Really? I didn't pick up on that.
[3178.79s -> 3184.31s]  What's up? How you doing? Sorry, that bruski got the better of me.
[3185.19s -> 3187.83s]  Was there something important on that license that I'm supposed to know?
[3188.87s -> 3193.51s]  Geez, man. You should know how to handle your liquor. I was trying to- Just try to bond with
[3193.51s -> 3199.19s]  Conrad, like you said. My guzzling bruise? Come on. Okay, okay. You go hit the high seas.
[3200.07s -> 3208.15s]  I'll be up when I'm good. Uh-oh. All right. Tanks are ready.
[3214.98s -> 3227.86s]  All right, tanks are ready. You ready to go for a dive? Hold on. Listen, hold on. Hey. Hello.
[3228.68s -> 3240.87s]  Hey. Hey. That was strange. I gotta get my steps in. How are you feeling?
[3242.36s -> 3249.03s]  Shouldn't have had that beer. Shouldn't have had that beer. Can I talk to you again?
[3250.14s -> 3253.66s]  You know your brother can't handle his drink. Oh, shut up. Just a little seasick.
[3254.78s -> 3261.34s]  Yeah, my brother's fine. I'll be up as soon as I- Come and take- Conrad, give me a hand. Okay.
[3261.34s -> 3268.14s]  Wait, did I just? Yep. I think I just got a yoink. I just yuck you. It takes all that CO2 that you
[3268.14s -> 3273.66s]  normally just exhale into the water and instead it gets totally reused. Then it reduces decompression
[3273.66s -> 3283.91s]  time on your way up. State of the art. Okay. O2 check done. Is that a- No, that's a streamer
[3283.91s -> 3293.29s]  backpack. I mean, TwitchCon is in just 20 days. Thanks for sending me streams. Thanks for sending
[3293.29s -> 3299.82s]  me straight. Oh, hey guys. What? Jesus. Why are you so loud? I almost completely forgot. When I
[3299.82s -> 3304.78s]  was looking at the dive cam, I saw this huge hole in the tail. Kabooey. That's your way into the
[3304.78s -> 3310.94s]  plane. Oh, nice work, man. I actually did see that. You're welcome. Am I going down? I'm gonna go see
[3310.94s -> 3315.34s]  what Fliss is up to. You behave, Connie. When you dive, I'm gonna take control of the boat and just
[3315.34s -> 3327.82s]  leave. Nope. Definitely. Definitely. You're on camera. I'll take the wheel. Let's get a before photo.
[3331.99s -> 3343.40s]  Selfie stick. Because of the- I thought I was holding the shield. I thought I was holding
[3343.40s -> 3352.25s]  the shield. You ever have to use one? On a shark? Nope. What the fuck was that? Think about the
[3352.25s -> 3367.62s]  implications. All right. Here we go. You ready? I think it's time to mute. Yeah. Hey, good luck.
[3368.26s -> 3388.95s]  See you later. Or not. Don't you fall backwards in a dive? You go backwards in. Why mute? Because
[3389.59s -> 3394.95s]  Alex is getting a completely separate story connected to the one I'm doing, too. I think
[3394.95s -> 3405.51s]  I've seen the same thing you've seen. Oh. Well, eventually. Yeah, eventually. In about 25 seconds.
[3409.27s -> 3417.34s]  Unless I become the other character. You might. Howdy, captain. You fancy a pint with your second
[3417.34s -> 3422.86s]  in command? You are not my second in command. Third in command. No. Fresh and eager cabin boy.
[3423.66s -> 3430.14s]  Are you that? I'm the shark. I'm controlling it right now. Over a frosty amber liquid.
[3435.38s -> 3441.96s]  Pass. I have to stay focused on your friends down there. All right. Mute. Pretty nice ride you got
[3441.96s -> 3450.74s]  here. Where'd you get the cash? Shut up. Leave me alone. You know it's not polite to ask a lady
[3450.74s -> 3456.02s]  about her money. Fair enough. I was just thinking about buying a bug myself and I thought maybe-
[3456.02s -> 3467.42s]  At this point, just go sit over there. Sorry. I haven't got enough on my plate for the moment.
[3468.06s -> 3475.11s]  Rowdy is Fliss. I just freaky fighted you out of your own body and now I'm Alex.
[3476.39s -> 3487.43s]  It's all good. All right. So here we go. I'm controlling. Was that you or me? I'm on the
[3487.43s -> 3495.11s]  boat. What? I'm on the boat right now. I'm Fliss. We're not in the same- We're at different video
[3495.11s -> 3502.18s]  games. Okay. I thought- I thought I was just seeing what you were doing. Oh, no. All right.
[3502.18s -> 3513.40s]  Let's mute it. Wow. That is not your everyday wreck. I hope those clowns don't get me in trouble.
[3518.81s -> 3532.15s]  Mattel found a picture. I hope he's okay down there. Wait, binoculars. Nice.
[3565.88s -> 3578.70s]  Oh, Monka S. Monka S. Hold on. I- I missed it? What do you mean blind?
[3580.09s -> 3592.12s]  These things are all fucking scratched up and like scuffed up. What are you guys talking about?
[3592.12s -> 3609.98s]  Oh. Oh my god. It's a fucking buoy. All right. Let's talk. Can I talk to you? Let me get one
[3609.98s -> 3626.78s]  of those beers. I want a beer. It is you- I got to do some boat maintenance. Like, let's go.
[3633.82s -> 3642.95s]  I gotcha. Serious. Enjoy your vacation. Yeah, sure. Enjoy your vacation. Watch me.
[3646.63s -> 3650.39s]  All right. I gotta go clean like the bathroom or something. All right. To go boat maintenance,
[3650.39s -> 3661.58s]  I gotta go like re-oil the engine. Clean the sofa. Go fishing. Change the oil. What does- what
[3661.58s -> 3681.45s]  happened? What does- what happened to the maintenance? What is this? Okay, that was a gun.
[3683.13s -> 3697.16s]  That was a gun. Well, he's finding all these secrets. That's not fair. Am I gonna read a book?
[3701.90s -> 3720.33s]  Should I hold on to this? All right. Grab the book. Shroud of Innocence. God damn it. That one
[3720.33s -> 3726.41s]  wasn't me. I- you did that. I know. I pressed right bumper because somebody in- I got- mm-hmm. Yep.
[3726.41s -> 3729.05s]  What? That's all I needed to hear. That's all- what do you mean that's all you needed to hear?
[3729.69s -> 3733.53s]  I just wanted to make sure I'm not the crazy one. That right bumper actually pauses the game for no
[3733.53s -> 3737.13s]  discernible reason. One person said hit right bumper and I was like, why? Okay. And I just did
[3737.13s -> 3757.29s]  it. So I'm an idiot. All right. See. What was in the bag? No, it can't go in the backpack. All right.
[3757.29s -> 3764.14s]  So what do I need to do? Boat maintenance. I don't know what that means. What's in there?
[3766.54s -> 3782.52s]  No, don't go. What do I do here? Can I like change their oxygen levels? Oh, that's- what is that?
[3783.88s -> 3798.07s]  Clouds? What? There's another boat coming up on our- wait a minute. Give me the binoculars.
[3806.39s -> 3815.37s]  What? Okay. They're just here now. We have unexpected guests. Okay. Don't- don't talk about
[3815.37s -> 3820.47s]  the divers. Just relax. Do not mention we have people in the water. No. What do you think they
[3820.47s -> 3829.83s]  want? Maybe they're fishermen. Maybe that's their buoy. Okay. Be on guard. Be ready for this. I don't
[3829.83s -> 3851.02s]  know. Just be on guard. What's that about? That's not the Coast Guard. That is not the Coast Guard.
[3851.98s -> 3866.65s]  So we're not under arrest. Uh-oh. What's happening? I think I'm going into phase two.
[3870.58s -> 3875.96s]  Uh-oh. Hey, guy. Hey, get out of here. Get out of here. What do you think you're doing? Oh, shit.
[3875.96s -> 3887.43s]  Oh, shit. I hope I just didn't like kill italics.
[3896.70s -> 3900.22s]  Why did you just- money? Why are you flashing your money?
[3900.70s -> 3906.42s]  You think it's more like 30. I can do 30. All right. You guys drive a hard bargain,
[3906.42s -> 3917.56s]  but I'm with you. Here. Let's just throw in the whole pot. Let's go. No.
[3927.67s -> 3933.35s]  You are an idiot. What? They left, didn't they? That doesn't make you any less of an idiot.
[3933.35s -> 3938.47s]  That's true. A funny way of saying thank you, Conrad. Hear a piece of work, Conrad.
[3938.47s -> 3942.23s]  I'm not all work. I'm a little play, too. Are you trying to flirt with me?
[3943.03s -> 3947.67s]  Is it working? I don't even know what it is. Well, he sucks. When you think of something,
[3947.67s -> 3951.51s]  I'll just be over here taking in the view, flirting up a storm. Hashtag wink.
[3952.95s -> 3956.86s]  They're going to come back. We've got to get out of here.
[3957.42s -> 3967.34s]  Okay. I think they're on their way back up. And I was getting used to it just being you and me.
[3967.34s -> 3971.66s]  We need to light the grill. Oh, oh. Pick me. Pick me. You can call me Grill Capitan.
[3971.66s -> 3974.70s]  You may light the grill, but I will never call you that.
[3975.66s -> 3983.37s]  It's time for food. Watch this be how he does. I didn't have to do anything. He just like...
[3987.48s -> 3987.88s]  Okay.
[3994.87s -> 4003.94s]  Are you serious? I thought about it. I thought about it. I thought about it.
[4014.06s -> 4017.74s]  Yeah, I'm on the boat, too. Yep, that's true. I thought about it.
[4021.38s -> 4027.46s]  It was so close. I was set. I was a millimeter away from letting the boat just burn.
[4027.46s -> 4032.50s]  Everything's all right now. Hey, welcome back.
[4034.10s -> 4037.29s]  You almost killed me again, but this time I was smart.
[4037.29s -> 4041.21s]  There was a little mishap. A little issue with barbecue.
[4041.85s -> 4044.25s]  Jesus. Looked like the whole boat was lit up.
[4044.25s -> 4046.97s]  I thought the video games were to escape reality. Anyway.
[4048.49s -> 4053.90s]  These fishing guys came by and ran into the dive line.
[4053.90s -> 4057.66s]  Yeah, these idiots. They were just like, who cares?
[4072.89s -> 4077.21s]  Did you get ripped up? Did I get ripped up? Did I mess you up?
[4077.29s -> 4078.49s]  Just fucking perfect.
[4080.25s -> 4086.49s]  No, but I did pull the flight stick of the plane and it broke the plane in two.
[4088.71s -> 4099.66s]  Interesting so far. Let's see. Frankly, I hate it.
[4099.66s -> 4102.70s]  Getting to know these intrepid adventurers then.
[4102.70s -> 4106.62s]  Alex and his little brother Brad trying to swim with the big fish.
[4107.50s -> 4113.34s]  Both seem out of their dead. And Julia, the love of Alex's life.
[4114.70s -> 4119.85s]  If only she felt the same. What about Conrad?
[4119.85s -> 4124.57s]  A bold fellow, you might say. Or maybe you'd say arrogant.
[4125.37s -> 4131.37s]  And then there's Captain Fliss. Strong, forthright, stubborn.
[4132.41s -> 4137.93s]  She appears somewhat immune to Conrad's charms. So far, at least.
[4139.85s -> 4144.97s]  Let me reassure you. You can help them to make some decisions they'll value later on.
[4146.87s -> 4150.81s]  You're doing well. Thanks.
[4150.81s -> 4154.89s]  We can't let you lose yet. There's still three hours of gameplay.
[4155.45s -> 4162.49s]  You're doing very well. You didn't let the boat burn from the barbecue. Good job.
[4163.21s -> 4165.61s]  You have the intelligence of at least a nine-year-old.
[4165.61s -> 4171.05s]  How well preserved was the plane? Brad, it was insane. It was like traveling through time.
[4171.05s -> 4172.01s]  No shit.
[4172.01s -> 4175.61s]  Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension
[4175.61s -> 4179.45s]  where the past is underwater and everything is covered in barnacles and sharks.
[4180.09s -> 4180.73s]  Sharks?
[4180.73s -> 4181.77s]  Yeah, well, just one shark.
[4184.97s -> 4188.68s]  Wasn't Conrad going to get us some more beers after he helped Fliss?
[4189.64s -> 4191.96s]  Maybe he decided, hey, I'll drink some.
[4191.96s -> 4192.36s]  And then he got drunk.
[4192.36s -> 4194.84s]  Why don't you go get more beers in the ocean?
[4194.84s -> 4195.48s]  And since he was drunk, he forgot to bring it to us.
[4195.48s -> 4197.56s]  And he just kept on drinking and he drank all of it.
[4197.56s -> 4199.00s]  I think there were four beers in that case.
[4199.00s -> 4200.44s]  That sounds like he had some experience with this kind of phenomenon.
[4200.44s -> 4201.88s]  Yeah, I've been studying it for years.
[4201.88s -> 4202.76s]  I'll go look for him.
[4203.56s -> 4206.04s]  Yeah, why don't you get a run to the grocery store and get us some stuff?
[4206.76s -> 4208.60s]  I left it below deck if you want to check it out.
[4209.80s -> 4212.04s]  OK, now I'm.
[4213.08s -> 4213.88s]  Oh, wait, what's that?
[4214.68s -> 4215.72s]  So what are you seeing?
[4217.24s -> 4218.68s]  I'm about to grab the camera.
[4219.24s -> 4221.40s]  Oh, I want to see the cool pictures you took.
[4227.18s -> 4227.50s]  Nice.
[4229.50s -> 4229.74s]  OK.
[4233.75s -> 4234.79s]  Pretty cool looking.
[4234.79s -> 4236.07s]  This is how you took these.
[4239.99s -> 4241.11s]  This badge.
[4241.11s -> 4242.07s]  Conwin Island.
[4242.07s -> 4242.87s]  I was totally right.
[4243.59s -> 4245.38s]  All right, what else?
[4249.02s -> 4249.98s]  Can I put the camera down?
[4251.72s -> 4253.00s]  Oh, that's a good one.
[4254.63s -> 4256.23s]  Oh, that's scary.
[4256.23s -> 4257.91s]  I don't I did you to act.
[4263.29s -> 4267.35s]  All right, put this down.
[4269.70s -> 4271.30s]  They only dive 30 meters.
[4271.30s -> 4273.62s]  OK, yeah, OK.
[4275.58s -> 4277.18s]  But Oculus, let's take another look.
[4277.90s -> 4278.86s]  Let's take another look.
[4279.58s -> 4281.98s]  What about this thing?
[4281.98s -> 4283.66s]  Didn't mean to ruin your big moment.
[4283.66s -> 4285.26s]  It's OK, really.
[4290.90s -> 4292.42s]  Come on, you're supposed to be like the techie.
[4293.30s -> 4294.42s]  You can't like open this up
[4294.42s -> 4296.26s]  and take the battery out and use it to power some.
[4296.98s -> 4302.90s]  What's going on down here?
[4302.90s -> 4305.93s]  Uh, there's everybody else.
[4306.65s -> 4307.53s]  I'll go get them.
[4307.53s -> 4309.13s]  Why don't you just do it here?
[4309.13s -> 4309.69s]  Who's that?
[4310.65s -> 4313.06s]  Hey, you see my brother or Fliss?
[4313.06s -> 4315.86s]  Uh, no, I got distracted.
[4315.86s -> 4316.82s]  Let's go get him.
[4316.82s -> 4317.06s]  Sure.
[4318.10s -> 4325.83s]  So which one is, uh, you know, where the magic happens?
[4329.14s -> 4329.62s]  Where is it?
[4329.62s -> 4330.02s]  It's Alex.
[4330.02s -> 4331.38s]  Is he upstairs now?
[4331.38s -> 4339.82s]  Oh, no, that's not OK.
[4339.82s -> 4342.14s]  Hey, we're standing next to each other now.
[4342.14s -> 4343.02s]  Conrad, beers.
[4343.02s -> 4343.58s]  Where are they?
[4343.58s -> 4344.38s]  We are, yes.
[4344.38s -> 4345.58s]  Oh, yeah, the beers.
[4346.46s -> 4347.34s]  I was just getting them now.
[4351.61s -> 4352.41s]  Nice.
[4352.41s -> 4353.13s]  There's four in there.
[4354.44s -> 4355.72s]  We can all have one each.
[4356.98s -> 4358.74s]  And that's it for the whole entire trip.
[4365.59s -> 4366.23s]  All right.
[4366.23s -> 4367.67s]  Now that everybody's here,
[4367.67s -> 4370.07s]  let's take a look at the navigator's pad we found.
[4370.07s -> 4372.07s]  Maybe we can figure out why the plane was out here.
[4372.07s -> 4372.79s]  Where did you put it?
[4372.79s -> 4373.59s]  It's in your case.
[4373.59s -> 4374.47s]  OK, I'll go get it.
[4375.11s -> 4375.61s]  Hey.
[4377.40s -> 4380.52s]  Hey, uh, hey, are you going to say something?
[4381.00s -> 4381.50s]  No.
[4382.44s -> 4383.00s]  Oh, no.
[4383.00s -> 4383.48s]  Oh, shit.
[4383.48s -> 4384.20s]  I think I like this.
[4384.20s -> 4384.92s]  I think I accent.
[4384.92s -> 4385.24s]  All right.
[4385.24s -> 4386.20s]  I'm just OK.
[4388.58s -> 4389.30s]  Alex.
[4389.30s -> 4389.94s]  Holy crap.
[4390.50s -> 4392.10s]  Were you guys like in the plane?
[4392.10s -> 4393.94s]  I'm talking about your, uh, your adventure.
[4393.94s -> 4395.22s]  Got out in the nick of time.
[4395.22s -> 4396.50s]  Skin of our teeth.
[4396.50s -> 4398.74s]  Well, our skin was almost in a shark's teeth.
[4398.74s -> 4399.24s]  What?
[4399.38s -> 4400.18s]  Uh, yeah.
[4400.18s -> 4402.02s]  Didn't I tell you there are sharks around here?
[4402.02s -> 4403.22s]  Uh, but you saw a shark.
[4403.22s -> 4403.86s]  Most of them are.
[4403.86s -> 4404.74s]  I did see a shark.
[4404.74s -> 4405.78s]  Yeah, I thought it was you.
[4407.06s -> 4408.18s]  It almost got me.
[4409.14s -> 4414.65s]  So does the accident mean we can't do any more diving?
[4415.29s -> 4416.01s]  That's a good question.
[4416.01s -> 4417.93s]  Let me just say this once more for the record.
[4417.93s -> 4420.89s]  Going into that plane was super dangerous, obviously,
[4420.89s -> 4422.57s]  and twice as illegal.
[4422.57s -> 4423.29s]  Where are you?
[4423.29s -> 4426.25s]  Now damage is done, so we just have to lie about it forever.
[4427.13s -> 4428.09s]  Or else we're going to go to jail.
[4428.09s -> 4429.13s]  I'm exploring.
[4429.13s -> 4429.61s]  Oh, OK.
[4429.61s -> 4431.45s]  Well, my lips are sealed.
[4433.11s -> 4435.75s]  So we're going again tomorrow?
[4438.66s -> 4440.50s]  I thought I was going to learn something there.
[4440.50s -> 4442.82s]  You should be looking at this, because that's just all of our adventures.
[4442.82s -> 4443.70s]  We're all going to stay on the boat.
[4445.30s -> 4446.18s]  I think it's too dangerous.
[4446.82s -> 4448.82s]  I think it's too dangerous to go in the water.
[4452.70s -> 4453.98s]  I didn't even get to do anything.
[4456.74s -> 4457.78s]  Brad are for Brayson Lee.
[4458.74s -> 4460.02s]  You got a girlfriend?
[4460.02s -> 4460.58s]  Barbecue.
[4464.87s -> 4465.67s]  Are you with me?
[4465.67s -> 4465.99s]  I do.
[4465.99s -> 4467.27s]  No, I'm talking to Conrad.
[4467.27s -> 4468.23s]  Oh, I mean, I did.
[4469.11s -> 4470.39s]  Broke up with her, though.
[4470.39s -> 4471.35s]  Just too much to handle.
[4471.99s -> 4472.63s]  Women, right?
[4473.67s -> 4474.71s]  Yeah, women.
[4474.95s -> 4476.23s]  There's another boat just rolled up.
[4476.23s -> 4476.87s]  They exist.
[4476.87s -> 4477.59s]  You're correct.
[4477.59s -> 4480.55s]  They definitely exist, especially the one you just broke up with.
[4480.55s -> 4481.99s]  That one, for sure.
[4483.59s -> 4484.39s]  Right here.
[4484.39s -> 4484.89s]  Hey.
[4485.75s -> 4488.02s]  Yeah, I know, right?
[4488.02s -> 4488.82s]  That's how I feel.
[4488.82s -> 4489.46s]  What the heck?
[4490.34s -> 4493.43s]  We got places to be and things to do.
[4493.43s -> 4494.47s]  Here comes the drinks.
[4495.11s -> 4495.59s]  Enjoy it.
[4495.59s -> 4497.51s]  All right, if you drink, you die, guaranteed.
[4497.51s -> 4501.67s]  The first person to take the first sip is the person that we kill first.
[4501.67s -> 4502.39s]  Check it out.
[4502.39s -> 4503.43s]  I don't think we'll have to try.
[4503.43s -> 4504.63s]  I think they'll just die.
[4504.63s -> 4505.27s]  Screenshot that.
[4505.99s -> 4507.67s]  Who wants to find some sunken treasure?
[4508.79s -> 4509.99s]  So what do you think, Adam?
[4510.63s -> 4511.11s]  Coordinates?
[4511.67s -> 4513.35s]  Those are coordinates, all right.
[4513.35s -> 4515.03s]  Maybe the plane's destination.
[4515.03s -> 4516.47s]  You think we could get there by tomorrow?
[4517.03s -> 4518.31s]  It takes a couple hours if the weather's...
[4518.31s -> 4519.91s]  Is this what I found underwater?
[4519.91s -> 4520.47s]  I think so.
[4520.47s -> 4521.43s]  You find anything else?
[4521.43s -> 4524.79s]  There was a flight plan on board that seemed to indicate it was a rescue plane.
[4524.79s -> 4526.23s]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[4526.23s -> 4528.71s]  After the war, they turned long-range bombers into rescue planes.
[4528.71s -> 4532.15s]  And then this plane must have been shot down because it was riddled with bullet holes.
[4532.15s -> 4533.75s]  I found one lodged in a fuselage.
[4533.75s -> 4534.15s]  Huh.
[4534.15s -> 4535.43s]  And it was full of life rafts.
[4535.43s -> 4538.23s]  It must have gotten shot down before they could deliver all the rafts.
[4538.23s -> 4539.43s]  There was only one missing.
[4539.43s -> 4542.71s]  From the photos Alex took, you can see the flight badge on one of the corpses.
[4542.71s -> 4544.63s]  That means the crew is from Conwin Island,
[4544.63s -> 4546.47s]  smack dab in the middle of the Pacific theater.
[4547.67s -> 4548.39s]  Called it.
[4548.39s -> 4549.91s]  Reckless, all of you.
[4549.91s -> 4550.71s]  Excuse me?
[4550.71s -> 4553.11s]  I told you to leave everything down there alone.
[4553.11s -> 4553.83s]  Oh, come on.
[4553.83s -> 4555.03s]  We've been through this already.
[4555.03s -> 4556.23s]  I'm not talking about the love.
[4562.07s -> 4562.55s]  Then what?
[4563.77s -> 4564.89s]  Superstition?
[4564.89s -> 4565.53s]  Is that it?
[4565.53s -> 4565.85s]  Really?
[4567.26s -> 4569.34s]  The dead don't sleep well in these waters.
[4569.34s -> 4569.74s]  Constant conflict.
[4569.74s -> 4573.58s]  Makes me feel silly enough to you all, but I was raised on this shit and it sticks.
[4580.10s -> 4580.98s]  You're right.
[4580.98s -> 4582.42s]  We should have been more careful.
[4582.42s -> 4583.06s]  That's not me.
[4583.06s -> 4583.94s]  I'm sorry.
[4583.94s -> 4584.50s]  I'm lying.
[4586.10s -> 4586.50s]  Okay.
[4586.50s -> 4586.74s]  Okay.
[4587.38s -> 4588.10s]  Maybe.
[4588.10s -> 4588.98s]  True, but I'm lying.
[4588.98s -> 4589.78s]  I don't know you.
[4589.78s -> 4590.66s]  But you're lying.
[4590.66s -> 4593.54s]  You should have never gone down to that plane in the first place.
[4593.54s -> 4594.74s]  It's bad luck.
[4594.74s -> 4597.22s]  You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference,
[4597.22s -> 4600.18s]  but every single thing you bring back has an essence.
[4600.18s -> 4601.94s]  It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.
[4601.94s -> 4602.74s]  Here we go.
[4602.74s -> 4602.98s]  Huh.
[4603.70s -> 4605.14s]  I never thought about it like that.
[4605.14s -> 4606.42s]  You never think about much of anything.
[4606.42s -> 4608.74s]  Well, maybe I never heard about such cool ghost stories.
[4608.74s -> 4610.50s]  They're not cool ghost stories.
[4611.14s -> 4612.10s]  Not like for fun.
[4612.98s -> 4616.26s]  People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.
[4616.26s -> 4616.98s]  Damn straight.
[4617.94s -> 4620.10s]  Fred, you got a fun ghost story, right?
[4625.54s -> 4626.74s]  Yeah, I heard a story.
[4627.38s -> 4628.66s]  Happened right around here too.
[4628.66s -> 4629.30s]  Let's hear it.
[4629.86s -> 4631.14s]  We could all use a good show.
[4635.10s -> 4636.54s]  I'm turning this character around.
[4636.54s -> 4637.26s]  Let's hear it.
[4637.26s -> 4638.94s]  I bet you can spin a good yarn.
[4638.94s -> 4640.62s]  It's kind of messed up, actually.
[4642.47s -> 4644.07s]  Scare away, little bro.
[4644.07s -> 4645.51s]  Okay, here goes.
[4646.39s -> 4647.83s]  This story is true.
[4647.83s -> 4651.03s]  It had happened right near here in an old lighthouse.
[4651.03s -> 4652.07s]  Classic setup.
[4652.07s -> 4654.07s]  Wait, true story?
[4654.07s -> 4654.79s]  Where'd you hear this?
[4655.99s -> 4658.47s]  Wait, can somebody take a sip out of their fucking beer?
[4659.27s -> 4661.19s]  Are you making up the story to go along?
[4661.75s -> 4663.43s]  Ah, well, down by the dockside.
[4663.43s -> 4664.55s]  Dude, these are empty.
[4664.55s -> 4665.43s]  Where'd you get these?
[4665.43s -> 4666.71s]  Skin like a leather book.
[4666.71s -> 4668.63s]  Eye patch, wooden leg, the whole nine yards.
[4668.63s -> 4671.11s]  And for a dollar, he told me his secrets.
[4672.47s -> 4674.87s]  Okay, here we go.
[4674.87s -> 4677.43s]  The lighthouse stood atop in a toll.
[4677.43s -> 4679.35s]  Isolated from the rest of the world.
[4679.35s -> 4680.95s]  A lone beacon in the night.
[4680.95s -> 4682.15s]  A sailor's respite.
[4682.95s -> 4686.39s]  The lighthouse keeper would hear the waves pounding the rocky shore.
[4687.27s -> 4691.19s]  One misty morning, he comes upon a woman covered in blood.
[4691.19s -> 4692.79s]  She's stumbling down the beach.
[4692.87s -> 4696.07s]  He hurries to her aid, and she falls into his arms, sobbing.
[4696.07s -> 4699.43s]  As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.
[4699.43s -> 4701.03s]  He doesn't waste any time.
[4701.03s -> 4701.53s]  Smooth.
[4703.35s -> 4707.78s]  Let me interject.
[4707.78s -> 4709.14s]  Key of the one-track mind.
[4709.94s -> 4710.82s]  The woman answers.
[4711.70s -> 4713.22s]  That's what you had to do?
[4713.22s -> 4714.02s]  That's what I had to do.
[4714.02s -> 4715.38s]  Just give a response?
[4716.26s -> 4716.74s]  Of course.
[4716.74s -> 4719.94s]  I was doing, it's pretty popular nowadays.
[4719.94s -> 4721.22s]  They're alone for years.
[4721.22s -> 4723.78s]  You just watch a video, and then you say two things about it,
[4723.78s -> 4725.14s]  and that's the whole screen.
[4725.22s -> 4728.26s]  So they go to the top of the lighthouse, and there,
[4728.26s -> 4732.74s]  splayed on the floor, is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.
[4732.74s -> 4733.86s]  Always an axe.
[4733.86s -> 4735.70s]  I mean, do people even use axes anymore?
[4737.14s -> 4740.62s]  Okay, fine.
[4740.62s -> 4742.14s]  Then it was a meat hook.
[4742.14s -> 4744.86s]  They were slashed with a meat hook and hung from the rafters.
[4749.21s -> 4749.69s]  Wait a minute.
[4749.69s -> 4751.13s]  Are you changing the murder weapon?
[4751.13s -> 4752.41s]  I thought this was a true story.
[4752.41s -> 4753.37s]  A lot of blood.
[4753.37s -> 4754.33s]  A lot of carnage.
[4754.33s -> 4758.01s]  You can, things get told over generations if you lose a little bit of detail.
[4758.97s -> 4759.53s]  Who did it?
[4766.47s -> 4769.03s]  The woman says, it was my brother.
[4769.03s -> 4772.47s]  And she turns to the closet and says, he's hiding in there.
[4773.27s -> 4774.55s]  Great, blame the brother.
[4775.43s -> 4779.11s]  So the lighthouse keeper creeps over to the closet, opens the door,
[4779.11s -> 4782.71s]  and sure enough, there's a man inside,
[4783.43s -> 4785.99s]  but he sliced out his own insides with a meat hook.
[4786.79s -> 4790.23s]  Horrified, he looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.
[4790.95s -> 4793.03s]  Closer, closer.
[4793.91s -> 4797.19s]  And he sees, it's his own face.
[4797.99s -> 4800.39s]  And then it's eyes bulge out and screams.
[4800.39s -> 4801.19s]  Nice play, Dex.
[4803.19s -> 4804.23s]  You're so gross.
[4804.23s -> 4805.27s]  Ah, that's terrible.
[4805.27s -> 4806.07s]  Super twist.
[4806.07s -> 4806.57s]  Nice.
[4809.35s -> 4810.31s]  Nice one, Squire.
[4818.57s -> 4819.93s]  You let me go in.
[4819.93s -> 4820.73s]  Thunder.
[4820.73s -> 4821.21s]  Summoning thunder.
[4821.21s -> 4822.65s]  Maybe I'm a cheese there, corn dog.
[4824.17s -> 4826.57s]  Okay, you've all had your fun.
[4827.53s -> 4828.41s]  We should all turn in.
[4828.41s -> 4829.77s]  There's some weather hitting, are we?
[4829.77s -> 4830.25s]  Uh-uh.
[4830.25s -> 4832.89s]  No, no, no, no, because according to standard vessel regulation,
[4832.89s -> 4835.29s]  we're all required one more beer before hitting the hay.
[4835.29s -> 4836.57s]  What regular issues are these?
[4837.29s -> 4842.81s]  It's standard issue regulatory institutional protocol subdivision 1099.
[4842.81s -> 4843.77s]  Uh-huh.
[4843.77s -> 4844.89s]  Where'd you read that?
[4844.89s -> 4845.37s]  The internet.
[4845.37s -> 4848.65s]  Oh, so you found a website that tells you to drink beer under every circumstance.
[4848.65s -> 4850.25s]  I'm just following orders, man.
[4850.25s -> 4851.53s]  I'm into this website.
[4851.53s -> 4852.57s]  And for good, buddy.
[4852.57s -> 4853.29s]  And I'm out.
[4860.65s -> 4861.15s]  Yep.
[4861.61s -> 4862.33s]  Yeah.
[4862.33s -> 4864.81s]  Well, you really can't add anything.
[4864.81s -> 4866.17s]  No, nothing to add to that one.
[4872.26s -> 4873.54s]  By the way, the ship's gonna sink.
[4876.17s -> 4877.37s]  Like, imminently.
[4877.37s -> 4877.87s]  Yes.
[4878.65s -> 4880.73s]  No, I mean, seriously, I saw a photo.
[4881.29s -> 4881.79s]  Oh.
[4883.45s -> 4891.43s]  All right, storm incoming.
[4893.03s -> 4896.07s]  Is this, like, the Kingdom Hearts characters?
[4896.07s -> 4896.79s]  Scary guy.
[4906.68s -> 4907.40s]  It's Mickey.
[4913.05s -> 4913.55s]  Oh, God.
[4913.77s -> 4920.23s]  Oh, is this, like, is this you?
[4921.03s -> 4922.07s]  I'm on the bed.
[4922.79s -> 4925.74s]  I punched the guy in the face.
[4925.74s -> 4926.24s]  Oh.
[4926.78s -> 4933.08s]  So about that boat from earlier.
[4933.08s -> 4934.52s]  About that.
[4934.52s -> 4936.04s]  This they would just know.
[4936.76s -> 4938.47s]  Was it the same people?
[4938.47s -> 4939.59s]  I don't think so.
[4939.59s -> 4940.15s]  I can't tell.
[4941.11s -> 4942.15s]  They're in, like, hoods.
[4943.51s -> 4944.63s]  Well, it's raining outside.
[4955.19s -> 4955.69s]  Uh-oh.
[4957.72s -> 4958.22s]  Uh-oh.
[4959.48s -> 4973.78s]  All right.
[4973.78s -> 4974.82s]  What's your decision?
[4974.82s -> 4975.32s]  Uh.
[4978.34s -> 4978.84s]  Captain.
[4989.61s -> 4991.93s]  You would choose the captain when you're all tied up.
[4991.93s -> 4993.85s]  You gotta choose the captain.
[4993.85s -> 4996.33s]  The captain, it's gotta, that's the decision maker.
[5000.36s -> 5002.44s]  Just keep the tape on my mouth.
[5005.58s -> 5006.54s]  Don't take it off me.
[5008.63s -> 5009.13s]  Talk.
[5009.83s -> 5010.87s]  Of course he chooses her.
[5010.87s -> 5011.83s]  Yeah, the brother and sister.
[5011.83s -> 5015.51s]  Why wouldn't I choose brother and sister over that guy?
[5015.51s -> 5018.39s]  That's like Deadpool in Wolverine Origins.
[5019.19s -> 5020.55s]  We both can't talk.
[5026.34s -> 5027.54s]  We didn't think this through.
[5028.34s -> 5028.90s]  Neither of us can speak.
[5028.90s -> 5029.30s]  Hold on.
[5029.30s -> 5030.34s]  What's going on?
[5030.34s -> 5030.84s]  Why?
[5031.54s -> 5032.98s]  What was that whole scenario?
[5033.62s -> 5036.74s]  I didn't ungag you and you didn't ungag me.
[5036.74s -> 5038.02s]  So we both can't talk.
[5040.26s -> 5042.02s]  Is that what we were supposed to be doing?
[5042.02s -> 5042.26s]  Yeah.
[5042.26s -> 5043.46s]  I got the captain because I...
[5051.06s -> 5052.34s]  That's just like we play it.
[5052.34s -> 5061.66s]  Ow.
[5062.04s -> 5062.68s]  Oh, it hurts.
[5072.66s -> 5073.54s]  Why does that always hurt?
[5075.61s -> 5076.49s]  Hey, so...
[5076.49s -> 5078.73s]  No one's ever had that in a movie taken off and go...
[5080.25s -> 5084.25s]  The bad news is these are kind of maybe the fishermen I missed off earlier.
[5084.25s -> 5085.85s]  Oh, god damn it, comrade.
[5085.85s -> 5086.41s]  Great.
[5086.41s -> 5087.21s]  Just great.
[5087.21s -> 5087.93s]  And the good news?
[5088.65s -> 5089.85s]  I recognize them.
[5089.85s -> 5090.81s]  How was that good news?
[5090.81s -> 5092.57s]  I thought you were gonna ask the good news first.
[5092.57s -> 5094.09s]  You're such an idiot, Jesus.
[5098.12s -> 5099.80s]  We have to get free right now.
[5101.10s -> 5103.66s]  So are you seeing what I'm seeing or are you in a different room?
[5103.66s -> 5105.18s]  No, you're Alex, right?
[5106.14s -> 5106.64s]  Yeah.
[5109.10s -> 5109.66s]  You're what?
[5109.66s -> 5110.16s]  Are you...
[5111.02s -> 5111.98s]  Wait, I'm Alex and...
[5114.28s -> 5115.24s]  Who are you playing as?
[5115.24s -> 5116.12s]  Conrad.
[5116.12s -> 5116.62s]  Yeah.
[5130.49s -> 5131.53s]  No, I know I'm Conrad.
[5131.53s -> 5133.21s]  I didn't know if he was controlling anybody in this room.
[5133.21s -> 5134.89s]  I didn't know if you were anybody, somebody else.
[5145.93s -> 5147.45s]  I'll be back for you later.
[5148.97s -> 5149.93s]  I tried to help.
[5149.93s -> 5150.25s]  All right.
[5150.25s -> 5150.97s]  I tried to help.
[5151.69s -> 5152.33s]  See you later.
[5162.28s -> 5164.76s]  You can go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
[5165.56s -> 5166.44s]  You're the little lady.
[5173.13s -> 5174.33s]  There's no QTE there.
[5175.05s -> 5175.93s]  I would have dodged it.
[5182.90s -> 5184.10s]  This guy just...
[5184.10s -> 5184.66s]  Seriously.
[5193.56s -> 5194.52s]  Uh, all right, I...
[5195.24s -> 5198.30s]  I'm gonna try to save this.
[5205.51s -> 5205.99s]  Oh, no.
[5207.43s -> 5207.91s]  Don't do it.
[5208.95s -> 5215.59s]  Slow down.
[5216.76s -> 5217.26s]  Easy.
[5218.68s -> 5219.18s]  Uh...
[5221.66s -> 5222.38s]  No, he...
[5222.38s -> 5223.90s]  When he opens his mouth, bad things happen.
[5235.16s -> 5236.44s]  Should have kept the tape on my mouth.
[5245.12s -> 5246.16s]  Kill Conrad.
[5248.27s -> 5248.77s]  Yep.
[5261.53s -> 5263.53s]  You would not believe what I just saw.
[5264.33s -> 5265.61s]  They got fucking...
[5265.61s -> 5266.57s]  There's a carnival up there.
[5266.57s -> 5267.21s]  There's clowns.
[5267.77s -> 5269.61s]  There is food and shit.
[5269.61s -> 5270.65s]  It's really...
[5270.65s -> 5271.21s]  It's kind of fun.
[5271.77s -> 5272.17s]  Really?
[5272.17s -> 5273.29s]  Did you see what I saw?
[5273.29s -> 5273.79s]  Yep.
[5273.79s -> 5274.49s]  It was pretty interesting.
[5275.93s -> 5276.65s]  That's, uh...
[5277.45s -> 5280.65s]  Considering I was watching half the things that happened through this looking glass.
[5283.84s -> 5285.52s]  They're just traveling clowns.
[5290.96s -> 5291.76s]  That's good news.
[5303.96s -> 5304.44s]  All right.
[5304.44s -> 5305.00s]  Here we go.
[5307.23s -> 5308.19s]  What's the game plan here?
[5313.36s -> 5314.08s]  Uh, I don't know.
[5314.08s -> 5315.28s]  I have no idea what's happening right now.
[5315.28s -> 5316.24s]  I just was sitting in the room.
[5323.40s -> 5323.96s]  Oh, that's you.
[5323.96s -> 5324.52s]  You're controlling.
[5333.13s -> 5334.81s]  We found some scissors while you were gone.
[5334.81s -> 5335.29s]  Oh, that's good.
[5342.73s -> 5343.13s]  So you have...
[5344.25s -> 5344.97s]  Do you have scissors?
[5345.85s -> 5347.45s]  Um, I think I still have scissors.
[5347.45s -> 5348.17s]  Do you have a weapon?
[5349.05s -> 5352.64s]  Did you see, like, a man in...
[5352.64s -> 5353.60s]  Yeah, that's the guy.
[5354.00s -> 5354.96s]  That's the guy telling the story.
[5354.96s -> 5356.24s]  That's the guy writing in the book.
[5356.24s -> 5356.88s]  That's what I thought.
[5356.88s -> 5359.05s]  He's watching.
[5359.05s -> 5359.45s]  He's...
[5359.45s -> 5360.65s]  So he's a clown too?
[5360.65s -> 5362.81s]  Yeah, he's making sure that we make the right decision.
[5373.63s -> 5379.05s]  How much money they have?
[5384.76s -> 5389.00s]  Yeah, they said that to do the full juggling act, it was going to be $1,500.
[5389.80s -> 5393.12s]  We need to make sure we can pay for it.
[5394.08s -> 5405.34s]  So the next part of this game is a real-time reenactment of what it's like to be
[5405.90s -> 5408.38s]  a hostage on a boat for 24 hours.
[5410.32s -> 5411.60s]  We're just going to sit here and shit our pants.
[5411.60s -> 5412.32s]  We came here on a boat.
[5412.32s -> 5413.44s]  Maybe we can take it.
[5413.44s -> 5416.27s]  Yeah. Yeah, it's a speedboat.
[5416.27s -> 5418.80s]  The main gun. He's got a gun.
[5418.80s -> 5419.52s]  Okay, that's a gun.
[5420.24s -> 5423.44s]  We got scissors versus, uh, scissors versus gun.
[5423.44s -> 5424.08s]  Keep that in mind.
[5424.72s -> 5429.58s]  At least one of us can get on their boat.
[5430.14s -> 5430.70s]  Get some help.
[5434.83s -> 5437.47s]  If you can distract them, I can get on that boat.
[5438.11s -> 5440.59s]  The dude with the gun won't even realize until I'm long gone.
[5441.47s -> 5442.19s]  Seven seconds.
[5442.91s -> 5444.11s]  I can get out through the window.
[5444.11s -> 5445.31s]  We gotta break these off first.
[5445.31s -> 5446.11s]  Too loud.
[5446.11s -> 5446.67s]  They'll hear it.
[5446.91s -> 5448.43s]  We're gonna break them during the thunder.
[5448.43s -> 5449.31s]  During the thunder.
[5449.31s -> 5449.81s]  Good call.
[5450.67s -> 5451.95s]  Hey, where's, uh, where's the brother?
[5451.95s -> 5453.39s]  He can just tell them a scary story.
[5453.39s -> 5454.35s]  You guys, distract them.
[5455.79s -> 5456.59s]  Break the window.
[5456.59s -> 5458.59s]  Stay focused and get to the boat.
[5458.59s -> 5461.20s]  All right, here we go.
[5461.20s -> 5463.31s]  Okay, let's do it.
[5463.31s -> 5464.03s]  Do I have to break it?
[5464.03s -> 5464.75s]  Do you have to break it?
[5465.39s -> 5466.35s]  Time it with the lightning.
[5466.35s -> 5466.85s]  Remember?
[5470.22s -> 5472.14s]  Wait, hold on.
[5472.14s -> 5472.94s]  With the thunder, right?
[5481.82s -> 5483.98s]  What? Why would you do that?
[5483.98s -> 5485.26s]  Why wouldn't you wait for the next thunder?
[5485.26s -> 5487.18s]  You were just saying we had to time it with the thunder.
[5488.54s -> 5489.50s]  It's gonna happen again.
[5492.09s -> 5503.52s]  Now we got, oh, is that me?
[5504.80s -> 5506.64s]  How are we supposed to stab him?
[5506.64s -> 5508.64s]  What? No, this is me.
[5509.44s -> 5510.75s]  Give me the knife.
[5511.47s -> 5514.00s]  Get him.
[5514.94s -> 5515.34s]  All right.
[5516.54s -> 5524.03s]  Buster, it's amateur hour over here.
[5524.83s -> 5526.11s]  All right, we've got our own hostage.
[5526.11s -> 5527.15s]  I got this.
[5527.15s -> 5530.88s]  Let me handle it.
[5530.88s -> 5531.38s]  Okay.
[5536.86s -> 5537.98s]  What's going on out here?
[5538.86s -> 5540.30s]  Wait, do you have one, too?
[5554.76s -> 5556.60s]  We both have hostages.
[5556.60s -> 5557.32s]  Let's finish this.
[5566.28s -> 5568.04s]  All right, I'm going for the gun.
[5568.04s -> 5568.54s]  Be ready.
[5570.44s -> 5571.60s]  Oh, that didn't.
[5571.60s -> 5572.96s]  What? How could you?
[5572.96s -> 5574.64s]  Oh, you still have your hostages, all right?
[5574.64s -> 5575.60s]  I still got one hostage.
[5575.60s -> 5578.80s]  All right, we still got an ace.
[5593.98s -> 5594.48s]  Why?
[5606.32s -> 5612.99s]  Oh, hey, I can't let sister die.
[5614.03s -> 5614.53s]  No.
[5616.35s -> 5617.15s]  An eye for an eye.
[5619.26s -> 5619.76s]  What?
[5621.02s -> 5621.98s]  An eye for an eye.
[5621.98s -> 5622.48s]  No.
[5624.04s -> 5624.54s]  What happened?
[5625.34s -> 5627.30s]  Who's?
[5627.30s -> 5627.80s]  We got shot.
[5629.98s -> 5630.48s]  Who?
[5630.86s -> 5631.36s]  What?
[5632.78s -> 5633.82s]  Why did you let that happen?
[5634.54s -> 5636.38s]  Why do you go to the gym every day, Alex?
[5636.38s -> 5637.02s]  If not for this?
[5637.98s -> 5638.48s]  What?
[5639.02s -> 5642.56s]  Bring them downstairs.
[5642.56s -> 5643.06s]  Take this.
[5644.00s -> 5645.12s]  Use it if you have to.
[5645.76s -> 5648.19s]  Hold on.
[5648.19s -> 5648.69s]  Wait, did you?
[5649.47s -> 5652.37s]  Who is?
[5652.37s -> 5653.25s]  Did somebody get shot?
[5653.89s -> 5654.39s]  Yeah.
[5655.09s -> 5656.69s]  He got shot in the leg.
[5656.69s -> 5657.19s]  He's fine.
[5658.88s -> 5659.68s]  No, who got shot?
[5660.64s -> 5661.14s]  Sit.
[5663.28s -> 5665.68s]  Upstairs, the girl who's pointing the gun at.
[5666.24s -> 5670.00s]  I can't believe we had two hostages and we didn't get that.
[5670.00s -> 5671.20s]  Julia's dead?
[5671.20s -> 5671.70s]  Yeah.
[5673.60s -> 5674.40s]  He's shot her.
[5675.44s -> 5677.04s]  Yeah, but then you like shove him out of the way.
[5678.42s -> 5680.10s]  I thought, I thought that's what happened.
[5687.42s -> 5693.22s]  Why am I getting blamed for this?
[5693.22s -> 5695.54s]  We had two hostages in control of the situation.
[5695.54s -> 5696.42s]  Which one of you is?
[5696.42s -> 5697.86s]  I didn't lose the first hostage.
[5700.43s -> 5701.47s]  Why am I getting the blame?
[5702.43s -> 5703.71s]  I did lose the first hostage,
[5703.71s -> 5704.83s]  but I was going for the gun.
[5720.77s -> 5721.27s]  What?
[5721.33s -> 5721.83s]  It's okay.
[5722.61s -> 5723.33s]  See?
[5723.33s -> 5723.65s]  Hold on.
[5723.65s -> 5724.29s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5724.29s -> 5727.01s]  She's got shot in the face?
[5727.01s -> 5727.49s]  What happened?
[5727.49s -> 5728.61s]  You guys are overreacting.
[5730.19s -> 5730.59s]  We're good.
[5731.79s -> 5734.35s]  This is basically the same thing that would happen if we just let them go.
[5735.39s -> 5742.58s]  We would have still been hostages if we let them go.
[5742.58s -> 5744.26s]  We're hostages now, so.
[5744.26s -> 5745.86s]  How could we have been so stupid?
[5746.82s -> 5747.94s]  Well, lucky it's not worth.
[5748.98s -> 5750.42s]  I could have been killed.
[5751.22s -> 5753.50s]  What were you thinking?
[5754.54s -> 5755.04s]  Me?
[5759.31s -> 5761.15s]  This isn't just about you, Julia.
[5761.15s -> 5763.55s]  We could have turned it around and we wouldn't be in this mess right now.
[5763.55s -> 5764.05s]  All right?
[5764.91s -> 5766.19s]  Shut the fuck up!
[5767.47s -> 5771.09s]  I'm not gonna take that from you.
[5771.09s -> 5772.61s]  There is no harm in just talking.
[5772.61s -> 5773.41s]  We're just talking.
[5774.29s -> 5777.04s]  The volume down.
[5777.04s -> 5779.57s]  All right, can we get two more hostages again?
[5780.75s -> 5782.51s]  I wonder if we can get two hostages.
[5784.37s -> 5786.85s]  This time let's go for two hostages and we're gonna play it correct this time.
[5786.85s -> 5787.65s]  I like this one.
[5788.37s -> 5789.97s]  Knows when to keep his mouth shut.
[5792.45s -> 5792.95s]  What?
[5794.24s -> 5796.56s]  S, I have a controller in my hand.
[5796.56s -> 5798.00s]  There's no S on my controller.
[5822.29s -> 5823.17s]  All right, what do I do here?
[5828.32s -> 5828.82s]  Okay.
[5829.44s -> 5832.24s]  Well, I gotta see like the secret code to get help.
[5832.24s -> 5833.84s]  Milan requesting weather update.
[5835.44s -> 5835.94s]  Over.
[5839.90s -> 5842.22s]  Be like Duke of Milan seeking.
[5842.22s -> 5842.72s]  Here we go.
[5843.90s -> 5845.18s]  How bad is the storm?
[5845.18s -> 5848.78s]  Hey, uh, just requesting any information about this storm you can give us.
[5849.42s -> 5851.58s]  It's a little bit hairy out here.
[5851.58s -> 5852.08s]  Yep.
[5852.86s -> 5855.22s]  There's gotta be a code coming in from the east.
[5855.22s -> 5856.26s]  Gotta hit you pretty hard.
[5856.26s -> 5858.66s]  It should pass through your coordinates within an hour.
[5858.66s -> 5861.07s]  Sound a little stressed, Duke?
[5861.07s -> 5861.57s]  Okay.
[5861.57s -> 5862.83s]  Please let me know if you need assistance.
[5862.83s -> 5868.78s]  Not used to a little weather freaking you out.
[5868.78s -> 5871.58s]  My uh, my charter's been a little difficult.
[5872.54s -> 5874.14s]  Not exactly going as planned.
[5874.14s -> 5876.70s]  We're starting to have some serious problems with...
[5876.70s -> 5877.20s]  Hey.
[5877.98s -> 5878.94s]  This is being dipped.
[5886.22s -> 5887.02s]  So obvious.
[5888.62s -> 5893.07s]  Do I get to move around up here?
[5896.67s -> 5897.63s]  Oh my god.
[5898.67s -> 5899.87s]  He just saved me.
[5900.91s -> 5903.07s]  He just fucking rescued me.
[5907.63s -> 5910.59s]  You want to talk about like scripted event where she can't die?
[5911.15s -> 5914.75s]  Even the fucking bad guy just reached his hand out and saved my life.
[5916.03s -> 5929.68s]  What is she stabbing?
[5941.71s -> 5949.38s]  I gotta help.
[5950.02s -> 5951.17s]  No, I gotta hold.
[5951.97s -> 5952.47s]  Hey.
[5952.93s -> 5954.05s]  Alright, this is important.
[5955.60s -> 5956.40s]  Alright, this is important.
[5956.40s -> 5957.44s]  We gotta work together here.
[5958.48s -> 5958.98s]  Okay.
[5960.02s -> 5961.94s]  Um, we're all in the same room.
[5962.90s -> 5964.66s]  I got hit in the face with a frying pan.
[5964.66s -> 5965.78s]  What the fuck, Alex?
[5965.78s -> 5966.58s]  Not the time.
[5966.58s -> 5967.54s]  Oh, you were gone.
[5967.54s -> 5968.90s]  Good job looking after number one.
[5968.90s -> 5969.54s]  In the face.
[5969.54s -> 5970.34s]  Real smooth.
[5970.34s -> 5971.06s]  Uh.
[5971.06s -> 5972.26s]  Great leadership, Fliss.
[5973.54s -> 5975.54s]  So Alex isn't feeling too hot right now.
[5975.54s -> 5976.50s]  This is so hot.
[5977.46s -> 5979.54s]  Uh, this, yeah, it got louder.
[5980.66s -> 5982.11s]  I turned the game volume down.
[5982.11s -> 5982.43s]  I don't trust this guy to drive.
[5982.43s -> 5983.79s]  He doesn't have any depth perception.
[5986.03s -> 5987.87s]  It's funny because I trust this guy.
[5987.87s -> 5990.03s]  Because he literally saved my life.
[5990.99s -> 5993.07s]  I got, uh, I got scripted.
[5993.95s -> 6003.55s]  Why is it picking up that much momentum?
[6004.75s -> 6010.08s]  I told you I didn't trust him to drive.
[6010.08s -> 6013.20s]  Everybody would have just planted against their insta-died, by the way.
[6014.08s -> 6017.02s]  All of us would have flown into the side of that and all of us.
[6017.02s -> 6018.38s]  Our boat would have capsized immediately.
[6018.38s -> 6019.82s]  Everyone's still alive.
[6019.82s -> 6023.38s]  This could have been different.
[6023.38s -> 6024.58s]  We did, we did a good job.
[6031.55s -> 6032.19s]  Frustrate.
[6032.19s -> 6033.71s]  He wants more carnage.
[6034.27s -> 6037.47s]  Everybody's still alive.
[6038.70s -> 6040.78s]  Kind-hearted creature I am.
[6040.78s -> 6044.06s]  I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's to come.
[6045.34s -> 6045.90s]  Tempted?
[6046.62s -> 6051.26s]  Uh, should we, should we?
[6051.26s -> 6052.14s]  Say nothing.
[6052.14s -> 6052.70s]  Say nothing.
[6052.70s -> 6053.74s]  Prefer, um.
[6054.70s -> 6056.06s]  Uh, do we want a tip?
[6057.18s -> 6057.82s]  No.
[6057.82s -> 6058.86s]  No tips.
[6058.86s -> 6059.74s]  Did I choose or did you?
[6059.74s -> 6061.34s]  Someone can't decide.
[6061.58s -> 6063.02s]  That doesn't bode well.
[6063.58s -> 6064.46s]  I said, say nothing.
[6064.46s -> 6065.18s]  I said, I don't.
[6067.20s -> 6071.60s]  Anyway, now that you've reached a point of significant distress,
[6072.32s -> 6075.28s]  I presume you're eager to get back to your story.
[6075.28s -> 6076.40s]  But here's the thing.
[6077.68s -> 6081.44s]  Everything may not be entirely as it seems.
[6081.44s -> 6083.28s]  It's like, yeah, mom, I know I have to do homework.
[6083.28s -> 6085.36s]  Like, you just, you came right in the middle of the movie
[6085.36s -> 6087.76s]  and like turned on the lights and then started talking.
[6088.48s -> 6089.68s]  Mom, I want to watch the movie again.
[6089.68s -> 6091.12s]  You shouldn't have said that.
[6091.12s -> 6092.48s]  Yeah, but like the trash is full.
[6093.20s -> 6094.16s]  It's like, all right, fine.
[6094.16s -> 6094.88s]  I'll, I'll do it.
[6095.68s -> 6100.35s]  And then she goes to the bookcase and pulls out your favorite book
[6100.35s -> 6102.27s]  and it's hollowed out with whiskey bottles.
[6103.31s -> 6106.58s]  She starts chucking right in front of you.
[6110.02s -> 6124.64s]  All right, here we go.
[6130.80s -> 6135.62s]  So where's, uh, is Tom Hanks in this one?
[6136.58s -> 6139.14s]  So should we try to keep, should we try to keep everybody alive?
[6139.78s -> 6141.54s]  Even the, the bad guys?
[6143.09s -> 6144.21s]  Even the bad guys?
[6147.47s -> 6150.19s]  At this point, I don't know what it takes to kill anybody.
[6150.83s -> 6151.33s]  Go.
[6152.69s -> 6154.77s]  I really thought somebody was dead in the hospice.
[6156.14s -> 6159.02s]  I thought I, yeah, it looked like somebody got shot in the face.
[6169.01s -> 6173.23s]  Did they really have to show all of us doing that?
[6174.19s -> 6176.43s]  There was like loading the next game play segment.
[6179.57s -> 6180.53s]  Jesus.
[6187.38s -> 6188.58s]  Nope, no thanks.
[6189.38s -> 6193.92s]  So we have friends now because they're not pointing guns at us anymore.
[6193.92s -> 6199.41s]  Apparently, apparently we're just in this together now.
[6205.12s -> 6207.92s]  All right, so we figured out who we are by the, yeah.
[6207.92s -> 6208.64s]  I'm Conrad.
[6210.40s -> 6211.04s]  I'm Julian.
[6213.25s -> 6214.29s]  Why are you faster than me?
[6218.08s -> 6218.58s]  Just am.
[6219.68s -> 6225.73s]  Flashlight, what is this?
[6226.29s -> 6233.09s]  This looks like signatures from, hey, hey, what the fuck?
[6233.09s -> 6234.29s]  That was like information.
[6234.93s -> 6235.81s]  Why would you do that?
[6236.61s -> 6238.13s]  They didn't finish writing that lore.
[6239.70s -> 6241.86s]  I mean, wouldn't you have wanted to know that?
[6243.52s -> 6245.20s]  Did you think I was going to hit you in the head with a clipboard?
[6249.44s -> 6251.52s]  That may have been very, very important information.
[6254.29s -> 6258.37s]  All right, this is a really cool like Disney interactive experience ride line.
[6261.09s -> 6263.09s]  With the actors too that are like, keep moving.
[6263.97s -> 6265.41s]  Ooh, that was scary.
[6266.13s -> 6267.17s]  Pirates of the Caribbean.
[6267.17s -> 6267.73s]  They're right there.
[6267.73s -> 6268.69s]  In the modern era.
[6268.69s -> 6269.57s]  I just got yelled at.
[6271.33s -> 6272.61s]  What do we, what was that?
[6273.97s -> 6274.47s]  Handcuffs?
[6275.11s -> 6278.53s]  Wait, wait, we can't go that way?
[6287.01s -> 6289.01s]  Oh, Conrad's from Salem, Massachusetts.
[6292.88s -> 6294.00s]  I dropped my handcuffs.
[6296.72s -> 6298.80s]  I just, I just don't know where you want me to go.
[6301.54s -> 6303.14s]  There might actually be clowns.
[6306.16s -> 6307.68s]  Supermassive loves clowns.
[6307.68s -> 6311.60s]  So, I mean, they, yeah, there might be clowns.
[6324.55s -> 6326.79s]  I'm just like AI pathing algorithm.
[6328.28s -> 6329.24s]  I'm not even a person.
[6330.12s -> 6330.76s]  What are you looking at?
[6331.49s -> 6333.33s]  I was looking at some clothes.
[6333.89s -> 6334.53s]  Some clothes.
[6335.09s -> 6335.49s]  What is it?
[6335.49s -> 6337.73s]  Anything, anything there we're looking at?
[6339.51s -> 6340.71s]  Just some clothes.
[6340.71s -> 6341.59s]  You already looked at it then.
[6343.25s -> 6345.73s]  Decided I wasn't ready to buy anything yet.
[6347.22s -> 6347.94s]  Just browsing.
[6347.94s -> 6348.42s]  Leave me alone.
[6356.63s -> 6363.03s]  What was that?
[6363.03s -> 6364.15s]  Can I, can we investigate?
[6374.36s -> 6374.68s]  What?
[6374.68s -> 6376.36s]  I, I moved to the steps.
[6377.00s -> 6377.96s]  What's going on?
[6377.96s -> 6381.16s]  I'm creating a situation.
[6381.16s -> 6382.04s]  I don't know how.
[6388.32s -> 6389.36s]  This is so dumb.
[6389.36s -> 6389.76s]  I love it.
[6391.62s -> 6392.50s]  Something over here.
[6392.50s -> 6393.06s]  A letter.
[6393.06s -> 6393.70s]  You go that way.
[6393.70s -> 6394.34s]  I'll go this way.
[6395.67s -> 6396.79s]  This is going to get knocked out of my hand.
[6407.75s -> 6412.98s]  Do they know where we are right now?
[6414.42s -> 6416.34s]  There's going to be some knowledge here.
[6416.34s -> 6417.70s]  They know the secret.
[6417.70s -> 6420.66s]  They know what happened and they know what's down here.
[6422.66s -> 6426.93s]  It's pitch black in here.
[6426.93s -> 6429.09s]  We should have killed those hostages when we had the chance.
[6432.87s -> 6436.24s]  He's actually going to give us a lamp.
[6437.28s -> 6438.00s]  Thanks.
[6438.00s -> 6439.76s]  Now we can really tell ghost stories.
[6439.76s -> 6441.12s]  He's kind of a nice guy actually.
[6442.69s -> 6444.21s]  I kind of sweet-talked him on the boat.
[6446.37s -> 6447.65s]  Wait, you had that the whole time?
[6447.65s -> 6451.65s]  Why didn't you just put alcohol in your mouth and just like spray it with the lighter into the guy's face?
[6452.21s -> 6461.48s]  How is this fucking place?
[6467.83s -> 6470.31s]  Dude, even those meatheads seem spooked.
[6475.75s -> 6477.75s]  You think this ship is the Manchurian gold?
[6478.31s -> 6478.63s]  I do.
[6478.63s -> 6480.71s]  We are in the vicinity of those coordinates.
[6483.89s -> 6485.33s]  It's still safe to this day.
[6485.33s -> 6486.13s]  We can't just sit around.
[6486.13s -> 6487.25s]  We need a plan.
[6487.25s -> 6488.05s]  How did we?
[6488.05s -> 6489.09s]  Nobody died, by the way.
[6489.09s -> 6490.13s]  I'm just trying to figure that out.
[6490.13s -> 6492.37s]  We're not exactly in the best position to be making any moves.
[6494.26s -> 6497.62s]  The second they let their guard down, we've got to take advantage of it and get off the ship.
[6497.62s -> 6499.14s]  There's got to be a big finale.
[6505.92s -> 6506.48s]  Yeah, man.
[6506.48s -> 6509.12s]  This whole rust bucket's one tetanus shot from the bottom of the ocean.
[6509.12s -> 6511.04s]  One of the options was, I'm hurt too bad.
[6513.59s -> 6515.19s]  Is Conrad really hurt right now?
[6515.19s -> 6517.83s]  Yeah, we've got to stay sharp and keep our eyes out for the right moment.
[6517.83s -> 6518.87s]  Did you do something?
[6518.87s -> 6519.11s]  No.
[6519.11s -> 6520.07s]  They spent a distributor cap.
[6521.19s -> 6522.87s]  I guess I got punched in the face once or twice.
[6524.52s -> 6526.20s]  Yeah, you got punched in the face like once or twice.
[6526.84s -> 6530.12s]  So, okay, what exactly is a distributor cap?
[6530.12s -> 6531.08s]  In layman's terms, please.
[6531.08s -> 6533.88s]  Pretend you're talking to someone who doesn't know anything about boats.
[6533.88s -> 6534.60s]  There we are.
[6534.60s -> 6538.92s]  Well, typically, a distributor cap is designed to distribute voltage from the coil to the correct
[6538.92s -> 6539.64s]  rotor, which in turn...
[6539.64s -> 6541.00s]  Glasses guy has to explain it.
[6541.88s -> 6543.32s]  It's an essential part of the engine.
[6543.32s -> 6545.40s]  We're not taking the Duke of Milan anywhere without it.
[6546.20s -> 6547.64s]  It's like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.
[6547.64s -> 6549.32s]  Can I see your glasses for a second?
[6549.32s -> 6549.72s]  Yeah, sure.
[6550.84s -> 6551.56s]  Can you say that again?
[6552.12s -> 6552.52s]  I don't.
[6553.48s -> 6555.00s]  I don't know anything about anything.
[6582.16s -> 6584.40s]  24 British archaeologists have gone missing.
[6588.12s -> 6588.68s]  What?
[6588.68s -> 6590.04s]  I picked this up in the bunk room.
[6590.60s -> 6591.00s]  I did?
[6592.32s -> 6595.60s]  Sounds like this guy is mad at another guy named
[6595.60s -> 6598.24s]  Patterson for playing sick to get out of guard duty.
[6598.40s -> 6600.96s]  Oh, found the way out.
[6600.96s -> 6602.72s]  I guess it's like the third time that happened.
[6603.68s -> 6605.68s]  They really must not have liked it in the cargo hold.
[6606.72s -> 6608.79s]  Go hold?
[6608.79s -> 6609.27s]  What the hell?
[6609.91s -> 6611.81s]  I think Conrad found something.
[6611.81s -> 6613.08s]  I'm going to check it out.
[6613.08s -> 6613.80s]  Love dialogue.
[6614.60s -> 6615.72s]  Wait, hold on.
[6616.68s -> 6617.24s]  Oh, what?
[6617.72s -> 6618.36s]  Why did it just...
[6619.08s -> 6621.51s]  Because I found something.
[6621.51s -> 6621.91s]  Oh.
[6621.91s -> 6623.83s]  More important than whatever you're talking about.
[6623.83s -> 6624.39s]  Apparently.
[6625.27s -> 6628.87s]  Do we need both people over there?
[6630.07s -> 6633.36s]  Hold on.
[6633.36s -> 6634.40s]  This is creeping me out.
[6635.44s -> 6635.84s]  Let me try to...
[6635.84s -> 6636.56s]  Are you over here?
[6638.85s -> 6640.05s]  I'm looking at glasses.
[6646.10s -> 6648.26s]  And they don't know what to do when you like push A.
[6651.62s -> 6654.20s]  That is a map, I think.
[6658.12s -> 6658.68s]  Got a map.
[6658.68s -> 6659.64s]  Come take a look.
[6659.64s -> 6665.35s]  I wonder what happened.
[6665.35s -> 6665.83s]  My...
[6665.83s -> 6666.63s]  Come take a look.
[6666.63s -> 6666.87s]  What?
[6668.61s -> 6669.01s]  Are we trying...
[6669.01s -> 6669.65s]  Is this you?
[6669.65s -> 6671.65s]  We're like ripping each other out of our cutscenes.
[6674.66s -> 6677.86s]  Was that you that I just stepped in front of to look at this?
[6678.66s -> 6684.47s]  There's a little dog and the name is...
[6684.47s -> 6685.27s]  Chip mascot.
[6685.27s -> 6685.99s]  We don't know the name.
[6687.49s -> 6688.45s]  Private Miller's letter.
[6689.09s -> 6693.28s]  We'll be soon and get a job as a mechanic and we can get married and have two children.
[6693.28s -> 6694.48s]  We'll be happy together forever.
[6695.70s -> 6696.10s]  Got it?
[6698.84s -> 6699.16s]  All right.
[6699.88s -> 6701.64s]  So who's going to have the stomachache?
[6703.25s -> 6704.21s]  I can't.
[6704.21s -> 6704.77s]  I can't.
[6704.77s -> 6707.25s]  We gotta go through the vent like a spy.
[6707.25s -> 6708.13s]  I can't get it open.
[6711.81s -> 6712.77s]  What's going on in there?
[6713.33s -> 6714.61s]  Oh, I'm going to puke.
[6715.73s -> 6716.53s]  This is ridiculous.
[6716.53s -> 6718.05s]  And they open up the door and then we jump them.
[6719.67s -> 6720.15s]  Every video.
[6720.15s -> 6721.51s]  And then you actually puke on it.
[6726.48s -> 6727.44s]  Everybody shut your pants.
[6727.44s -> 6727.68s]  Go.
[6728.40s -> 6730.48s]  That's not a bad idea.
[6730.48s -> 6735.25s]  I think we just gotta find out.
[6735.25s -> 6737.88s]  Do you want me to just smash through this wall?
[6740.05s -> 6740.37s]  What?
[6742.61s -> 6743.09s]  All right.
[6743.09s -> 6743.81s]  Yeah, let's go.
[6743.81s -> 6744.93s]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[6744.93s -> 6746.05s]  Big man on campus.
[6747.25s -> 6748.53s]  Someone should create a distraction.
[6749.09s -> 6749.49s]  Here we go.
[6749.49s -> 6750.29s]  This is going to be loud.
[6751.09s -> 6751.81s]  My stomach hurts.
[6754.50s -> 6755.62s]  I got shot.
[6755.62s -> 6756.66s]  Yeah, okay.
[6756.66s -> 6757.22s]  Conrad.
[6757.22s -> 6758.02s]  I don't feel good.
[6758.74s -> 6760.93s]  Dude, the classic stomachache.
[6760.93s -> 6761.25s]  Come on.
[6762.05s -> 6764.84s]  All right.
[6764.84s -> 6765.64s]  I'm going for smart.
[6766.20s -> 6767.38s]  Well, never mind.
[6767.38s -> 6767.70s]  We're going.
[6767.70s -> 6768.26s]  Wait.
[6768.26s -> 6768.50s]  Yep.
[6769.92s -> 6770.40s]  Come on.
[6770.40s -> 6771.04s]  Stomachache.
[6771.76s -> 6772.48s]  Stomach hurts.
[6790.45s -> 6791.49s]  That was a little kick.
[6793.33s -> 6794.29s]  Did you do a bigger kick?
[6794.85s -> 6796.93s]  You really want the president coming after you guys?
[6796.93s -> 6798.05s]  Because he will.
[6798.05s -> 6799.73s]  Each and every one of you personally.
[6799.73s -> 6800.93s]  This is all improv.
[6805.32s -> 6808.24s]  Hey, do you hear me?
[6808.24s -> 6809.20s]  I'm talking to you.
[6809.76s -> 6810.16s]  Hello.
[6812.07s -> 6814.47s]  They're not even going to attempt, I guess.
[6819.59s -> 6820.71s]  They're not even here anymore.
[6820.71s -> 6821.83s]  They like went to go get lunch.
[6823.88s -> 6824.92s]  Why are we all running?
[6828.80s -> 6829.44s]  Replace it.
[6831.44s -> 6832.88s]  Oh, nice move.
[6833.76s -> 6838.79s]  Why would you not replace it?
[6839.43s -> 6840.71s]  Because we had to get out of there quick.
[6845.70s -> 6850.21s]  Oh, she's about to go off the rails.
[6851.57s -> 6855.83s]  Julia and Conrad.
[6855.83s -> 6856.79s]  Don't barricade.
[6856.79s -> 6857.83s]  Use that as a weapon.
[6858.71s -> 6860.07s]  That was huge and heavy.
[6860.07s -> 6861.19s]  I love where they've done the place.
[6861.91s -> 6863.19s]  Come on.
[6863.19s -> 6865.22s]  There's only one person with a gun.
[6865.22s -> 6866.10s]  It wasn't that guy.
[6866.90s -> 6868.87s]  Look, they can't shoot all of us.
[6870.16s -> 6871.36s]  Everyone just charge them.
[6871.92s -> 6874.23s]  I thought I was you first.
[6876.48s -> 6877.12s]  Oh, shit.
[6878.34s -> 6879.46s]  What have I done?
[6879.46s -> 6880.02s]  I've done it.
[6880.98s -> 6882.98s]  It's been a while since our last pause.
[6889.03s -> 6889.43s]  Action.
[6890.93s -> 6891.65s]  You take that way.
[6891.65s -> 6892.93s]  I'm going to take this way.
[6892.93s -> 6897.06s]  Let's check in here.
[6900.76s -> 6902.39s]  Just keep moving.
[6902.39s -> 6904.87s]  No, I don't want to keep moving.
[6905.99s -> 6908.55s]  What if there's like med packs in here?
[6910.07s -> 6916.18s]  Oh, fragrant.
[6918.16s -> 6920.08s]  Where's reach in and dig around?
[6931.32s -> 6931.88s]  Press S.
[6935.64s -> 6936.12s]  I see you.
[6936.12s -> 6937.88s]  I was trying to come in
[6937.88s -> 6940.04s]  and it wouldn't let me, but I couldn't see you.
[6940.28s -> 6942.52s]  I just thought I was getting bounced off the wall.
[6942.52s -> 6943.40s]  You just did the,
[6943.40s -> 6946.20s]  I'm a guaranteed player controlled character.
[6948.20s -> 6949.64s]  That's like the second time they've done that.
[6950.76s -> 6952.26s]  What did you get?
[6952.26s -> 6953.54s]  Like rats?
[6953.54s -> 6954.10s]  Yeah.
[6954.10s -> 6955.62s]  Or bats?
[6955.62s -> 6956.58s]  I got rats.
[6957.38s -> 6970.02s]  All right.
[6970.02s -> 6970.90s]  Well, nothing in here.
[6976.07s -> 6977.75s]  There's no sense of urgency right now.
[6977.75s -> 6978.07s]  Yeah.
[6978.07s -> 6979.91s]  Well, the thing is like all the other characters,
[6979.91s -> 6981.75s]  the NPCs are just standing awkwardly
[6981.75s -> 6982.71s]  in the middle of the hallway.
[6983.43s -> 6987.30s]  I feel like I'm playing Spy Party.
[6987.30s -> 6989.14s]  Dozens of people on board.
[6989.14s -> 6990.34s]  That's why I was saying that guy.
[6990.34s -> 6991.30s]  I would have absolutely,
[6991.30s -> 6992.26s]  I would have sniped you right there
[6992.26s -> 6994.10s]  because there was no way you were an AI.
[6995.14s -> 6996.98s]  I mean, yeah, there's no way you were actually like,
[6996.98s -> 6998.10s]  you were definitely player controlled.
[7000.61s -> 7000.85s]  All right.
[7000.85s -> 7002.13s]  Well, this seems important.
[7002.13s -> 7002.69s]  What did he say?
[7004.93s -> 7006.60s]  I don't know.
[7006.60s -> 7007.32s]  Probably doesn't matter.
[7009.97s -> 7010.69s]  What was that?
[7010.69s -> 7011.17s]  What's that?
[7011.97s -> 7014.69s]  I just knocked the board off the wall,
[7014.69s -> 7015.57s]  but I didn't do that.
[7015.57s -> 7016.21s]  It just fell.
[7017.96s -> 7018.68s]  The ghost.
[7018.68s -> 7019.48s]  I can't go in there.
[7020.04s -> 7023.22s]  I got a little rat scare.
[7027.51s -> 7028.71s]  I didn't touch anything.
[7030.96s -> 7032.64s]  Are you in this room too?
[7032.64s -> 7033.44s]  Are you in the bathroom?
[7033.44s -> 7033.68s]  No.
[7034.40s -> 7035.65s]  I gotta go for now.
[7035.65s -> 7036.93s]  There's some commotion outside.
[7036.93s -> 7039.17s]  That usually means I'm about to be real busy for a while.
[7039.17s -> 7039.89s]  Right again soon.
[7040.45s -> 7043.01s]  There's a little boy on board and it sounds like Ted.
[7043.73s -> 7044.69s]  Oh, I am in the bathroom.
[7045.33s -> 7045.73s]  Mess with me.
[7045.73s -> 7047.33s]  There ain't no way we got to stow away.
[7047.33s -> 7047.65s]  All right.
[7047.65s -> 7049.17s]  You keep looking in the bathroom.
[7049.81s -> 7050.93s]  You keep finding secrets.
[7050.93s -> 7058.15s]  I haven't found any of these creepy NPCs.
[7059.03s -> 7059.27s]  What?
[7061.94s -> 7064.18s]  The captain is always like two steps in front of me,
[7064.18s -> 7065.22s]  just waiting for me.
[7065.22s -> 7065.86s]  That wasn't you?
[7066.74s -> 7069.12s]  That was not you.
[7069.12s -> 7070.08s]  I thought that was your shadow.
[7070.72s -> 7074.32s]  Oh, I see.
[7074.32s -> 7074.96s]  I saw that.
[7076.18s -> 7077.22s]  I'm trying to get to it.
[7077.22s -> 7078.42s]  These are like tank controls.
[7079.22s -> 7085.28s]  We have split up to a point where I don't even know where.
[7085.28s -> 7086.24s]  Oh, there you are.
[7086.24s -> 7087.04s]  There you are.
[7087.04s -> 7089.28s]  This place is fucking massive.
[7089.28s -> 7090.48s]  Is it super massive?
[7091.44s -> 7092.16s]  Good luck leaving.
[7092.88s -> 7094.08s]  Wait, how did you?
[7094.08s -> 7094.32s]  What?
[7095.12s -> 7095.84s]  Good luck leaving.
[7108.44s -> 7110.52s]  The something scary just happened music play,
[7110.52s -> 7111.72s]  but I didn't see anything.
[7111.72s -> 7113.00s]  I saw the guy.
[7114.04s -> 7114.44s]  The guy?
[7114.76s -> 7115.24s]  Yeah.
[7115.24s -> 7116.04s]  You aren't seeing like...
[7116.68s -> 7117.88s]  I ain't seeing nothing, man.
[7117.88s -> 7119.56s]  I read like one document.
[7119.56s -> 7121.08s]  Are you going to like hide in a closet
[7121.08s -> 7123.00s]  and am I going to like shoot you again?
[7123.88s -> 7124.44s]  Hope not.
[7125.32s -> 7127.60s]  I shouldn't have hid.
[7127.60s -> 7128.96s]  I should have just stayed out in the open.
[7130.63s -> 7131.51s]  How do you read books?
[7131.51s -> 7133.59s]  I'm waiting for you to open it so I can read over your shoulder.
[7134.63s -> 7135.43s]  It won't open.
[7135.43s -> 7136.55s]  That's actually what's happening.
[7137.35s -> 7143.14s]  There's structural problems with the ship.
[7143.94s -> 7146.58s]  Some electronic equipment is malfunctioning.
[7147.86s -> 7149.46s]  I saw a clown down the hallway.
[7150.18s -> 7151.38s]  Clean the floor.
[7151.38s -> 7152.74s]  Added lead to the soldiers.
[7153.30s -> 7154.02s]  Spell book.
[7155.49s -> 7156.37s]  Very informative.
[7157.01s -> 7163.67s]  Hey, I found something over here.
[7164.31s -> 7173.40s]  What is that?
[7173.40s -> 7174.69s]  A tooth?
[7175.33s -> 7177.94s]  All right, I found a dinosaur tooth.
[7179.41s -> 7181.33s]  Okay, now I got to find something cool.
[7184.74s -> 7185.70s]  No, it's dinosaur head.
[7190.98s -> 7191.70s]  Check out that dinosaur.
[7191.70s -> 7192.58s]  That's a dinosaur head.
[7195.62s -> 7196.90s]  I only find books.
[7201.44s -> 7203.04s]  One of them's got to have whiskey in it.
[7203.04s -> 7204.64s]  Uh-oh, there's a painting here.
[7205.44s -> 7206.85s]  Oh, this one's long.
[7208.63s -> 7210.55s]  Why is there a flashlight?
[7211.35s -> 7211.99s]  My book.
[7212.55s -> 7213.59s]  I don't even know who that was.
[7214.31s -> 7216.15s]  It's got multiple pages.
[7216.15s -> 7217.19s]  I don't have time for this.
[7218.07s -> 7223.32s]  Do you want me to tell you a story?
[7224.04s -> 7224.36s]  Sure.
[7225.00s -> 7225.96s]  No, you don't want to hear it.
[7232.72s -> 7238.12s]  All right, why was it just completely silent that whole time?
[7238.12s -> 7238.92s]  That was weird.
[7239.80s -> 7240.76s]  Nobody said a word.
[7241.72s -> 7242.68s]  Like none of our party?
[7242.68s -> 7243.72s]  They were just kind of walking?
[7243.72s -> 7245.16s]  Everyone was just walking with their mouth closed.
[7245.80s -> 7248.12s]  It's because they don't want the other bad guys to hear.
[7248.12s -> 7250.28s]  Well, I guess I won't read the rest of that book.
[7255.76s -> 7256.96s]  Did I get left behind?
[7257.52s -> 7258.48s]  I don't know, did you?
[7259.36s -> 7267.24s]  This is very difficult to multi-box.
[7277.12s -> 7280.80s]  Hey, let's just put like four pages per book in everything you find,
[7280.80s -> 7282.24s]  but you don't even have time to read it.
[7282.80s -> 7283.52s]  What is that thing?
[7284.80s -> 7286.56s]  What's with the sand castle builder?
[7286.56s -> 7287.12s]  The like bucket.
[7287.12s -> 7287.60s]  I don't understand.
[7287.60s -> 7288.56s]  What is that for?
[7288.56s -> 7291.28s]  Is it like the engine, the battery, the boat?
[7291.28s -> 7292.56s]  It's a Burger King crown.
[7292.56s -> 7296.23s]  Look, it's the distributor cap from the Duke.
[7296.23s -> 7298.15s]  Oh, the distributor cap.
[7298.15s -> 7299.51s]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[7307.19s -> 7310.60s]  All right, I think it's time for this guy to get read.
[7310.60s -> 7311.16s]  You know what I mean?
[7312.04s -> 7314.40s]  I thought we were sparing everyone in the whole game.
[7314.40s -> 7315.52s]  I'm going to go get it.
[7322.26s -> 7322.82s]  Wow, really?
[7324.10s -> 7324.98s]  You're going to fall for that?
[7326.39s -> 7326.79s]  See ya.
[7331.08s -> 7331.56s]  Oh, no.
[7333.46s -> 7334.74s]  Is she going to get read?
[7341.46s -> 7342.50s]  Just get it.
[7342.50s -> 7346.52s]  Did you make us do this?
[7347.08s -> 7349.68s]  Yes, just all of us go.
[7350.32s -> 7354.10s]  You know which upper body strength that takes?
[7356.63s -> 7357.27s]  Holy crap.
[7360.98s -> 7363.22s]  All right, you and I are going to have to read this guy.
[7364.42s -> 7365.38s]  Are you up or down?
[7366.02s -> 7366.85s]  I'm up.
[7367.41s -> 7370.68s]  Don't drop that.
[7372.58s -> 7374.90s]  Throw it strategically to distract them.
[7374.90s -> 7375.94s]  I'm trying to warn them.
[7376.58s -> 7383.92s]  Okay, if you have the opportunity to read this guy, do it.
[7383.92s -> 7386.08s]  I physically don't know who I'm supposed to be
[7386.08s -> 7389.12s]  because I haven't made a decision in 10 minutes.
[7396.80s -> 7397.28s]  Here we go.
[7399.89s -> 7400.13s]  What?
[7402.93s -> 7403.57s]  What?
[7403.57s -> 7404.61s]  What is going on?
[7406.21s -> 7407.33s]  He doesn't have a weapon.
[7407.33s -> 7409.25s]  That's the famous one-handed chokehold.
[7410.44s -> 7411.56s]  He doesn't have a weapon.
[7412.85s -> 7413.97s]  He's got a flashlight.
[7413.97s -> 7414.29s]  So?
[7415.56s -> 7417.00s]  And he's been drinking Gatorade.
[7419.88s -> 7420.12s]  Wait.
[7423.48s -> 7424.20s]  What the fuck?
[7427.56s -> 7438.40s]  What if we just all get caught, get put back in the same room
[7438.40s -> 7440.32s]  and escape the same way and have to do all this again?
[7441.32s -> 7442.04s]  I didn't do that.
[7445.97s -> 7447.09s]  Rowdy is deciding.
[7447.09s -> 7447.57s]  This is...
[7447.57s -> 7449.17s]  I like the way we game this game.
[7451.64s -> 7458.26s]  Oh, shit.
[7458.90s -> 7459.22s]  No.
[7460.26s -> 7462.10s]  It rolled right into him.
[7462.10s -> 7462.58s]  I see you.
[7463.46s -> 7464.02s]  Come on.
[7464.02s -> 7464.98s]  I just led.
[7467.83s -> 7468.15s]  Wow.
[7469.67s -> 7470.15s]  Hey, at least I got him.
[7470.15s -> 7473.75s]  Let the record show that I'm not responsible for anything that has happened.
[7473.75s -> 7475.35s]  At least I fucking chipped a tooth.
[7475.35s -> 7476.23s]  That's all I care.
[7477.11s -> 7488.71s]  Did we actually get put back in the room?
[7490.76s -> 7491.88s]  I think I'm on my own.
[7491.88s -> 7495.32s]  So, see you on the other side.
[7495.88s -> 7496.52s]  See you later.
[7497.70s -> 7498.10s]  Good luck.
[7498.74s -> 7499.78s]  Where are you taking me?
[7501.06s -> 7509.78s]  So, he's Alex.
[7521.96s -> 7524.76s]  What if I got too close and he did that to me from this way too?
[7524.76s -> 7525.40s]  Get back there.
[7543.76s -> 7544.40s]  Be ready.
[7545.60s -> 7546.24s]  Take him out.
[7546.24s -> 7546.72s]  Oh, no.
[7547.52s -> 7551.89s]  I'm going to be ready to take him out.
[7553.75s -> 7555.67s]  You picked the guy with the gun this time.
[7556.87s -> 7562.85s]  Guy before had a flashlight and you just like rolled backwards
[7562.85s -> 7564.29s]  while he grabbed you by the neck.
[7564.29s -> 7566.37s]  How are we going to take the guy out with the fucking gun?
[7567.09s -> 7582.34s]  I don't even think this guy knows where he's bringing us.
[7583.44s -> 7586.16s]  Right now, inside of his head, he's going like, oh, fuck.
[7586.72s -> 7588.24s]  I actually have no idea where this is.
[7589.04s -> 7590.40s]  I think it's over here.
[7590.40s -> 7591.84s]  All right, come out.
[7591.84s -> 7600.90s]  Damn it.
[7600.90s -> 7605.84s]  A hat on a stick.
[7610.45s -> 7612.13s]  These fucking places cursed.
[7613.72s -> 7614.36s]  Now you tell us.
[7615.00s -> 7619.17s]  Can I put the hat on?
[7619.73s -> 7627.92s]  Look at this.
[7627.92s -> 7629.43s]  Madam.
[7632.53s -> 7633.57s]  Bearing updated.
[7643.59s -> 7644.47s]  Donald Duck hat.
[7648.66s -> 7649.70s]  Holy shit.
[7650.58s -> 7656.53s]  Can I walk him into that?
[7657.09s -> 7658.45s]  Will he get steamed in the face?
[7659.09s -> 7661.40s]  Have we been here before?
[7662.20s -> 7664.40s]  I don't know.
[7666.16s -> 7669.14s]  Christ.
[7669.52s -> 7670.02s]  Oh, Christ.
[7670.72s -> 7671.22s]  That guy.
[7672.52s -> 7674.28s]  That guy's probably still right here with us.
[7674.84s -> 7677.17s]  I mean, you die on a ship.
[7677.17s -> 7678.21s]  Your ghost stays on the ship.
[7678.85s -> 7683.52s]  You have no idea what you're talking about.
[7683.52s -> 7684.64s]  That guy's still here.
[7685.44s -> 7687.44s]  Well, that was like 70.
[7687.44s -> 7688.64s]  That was like 80 years ago.
[7689.68s -> 7692.29s]  I think that guy probably walked around for a little while.
[7692.29s -> 7693.81s]  Maybe like a decade.
[7694.45s -> 7696.85s]  And then was probably just like, I'm kind of done with the boat.
[7696.93s -> 7698.13s]  And just like got in the ocean.
[7698.69s -> 7700.29s]  And just started swimming.
[7700.29s -> 7701.01s]  Ghost swimming.
[7701.01s -> 7702.69s]  And is probably on land somewhere now.
[7702.69s -> 7704.93s]  It's been like 20, 30, 40 years of that probably.
[7704.93s -> 7705.81s]  Nothing I've ever seen.
[7706.53s -> 7707.97s]  I would do that if I was a ghost.
[7707.97s -> 7709.65s]  I don't know what the fuck this is all about.
[7709.65s -> 7711.57s]  But we got to keep moving and find Olsen.
[7711.57s -> 7712.93s]  Why would I stick around in the same place?
[7713.89s -> 7720.90s]  Olsen?
[7720.90s -> 7722.02s]  To hunt.
[7722.72s -> 7723.22s]  Fuck that.
[7724.32s -> 7725.52s]  I want to see the ghost world.
[7725.52s -> 7728.48s]  I don't, wait, I'm going to stay inside of the closet here
[7728.48s -> 7731.52s]  and scare the next 200 people that live in this house.
[7732.24s -> 7732.74s]  No.
[7733.40s -> 7735.00s]  I'm going to see the fucking whole ghost world.
[7735.00s -> 7736.52s]  I'm not going to stay there.
[7736.52s -> 7739.34s]  That doesn't sound like fun.
[7751.43s -> 7752.07s]  Uh-oh.
[7752.07s -> 7752.47s]  Painting.
[7754.33s -> 7754.57s]  What?
[7754.57s -> 7756.01s]  Wait, you want, look, you want, Luke?
[7756.01s -> 7757.37s]  I got to look at this painting, man.
[7757.37s -> 7761.53s]  Like, I'm not even allowed to look at a painting.
[7763.66s -> 7765.18s]  Oh, this place is cursed.
[7765.18s -> 7765.90s]  It's so scary.
[7765.90s -> 7766.62s]  It's a cursed place.
[7766.62s -> 7767.82s]  Don't look at that fucking painting.
[7769.61s -> 7772.65s]  You're allowed to have like an outwards monologue for everything here, but not us.
[7788.30s -> 7794.36s]  Oh, here comes incoming re.
[7805.88s -> 7809.59s]  Okay.
[7809.59s -> 7810.31s]  Jesus, man.
[7810.31s -> 7811.43s]  It's just a door.
[7813.74s -> 7815.66s]  It's just a steel wall, man.
[7816.30s -> 7835.21s]  Where's the gun?
[7835.21s -> 7836.09s]  I want the gun.
[7836.09s -> 7849.19s]  All right, so there's evil, evil magician, evil wizard.
[7850.89s -> 7851.69s]  All right.
[7851.69s -> 7852.87s]  Where's the gun?
[7853.43s -> 7862.50s]  Where's the gun?
[7874.95s -> 7880.86s]  I don't know why.
[7880.86s -> 7881.66s]  You pick up the flashlight.
[7884.25s -> 7885.05s]  Are you serious?
[7890.31s -> 7891.83s]  Page 39.
[7891.83s -> 7895.14s]  Warlock streamer 33.
[7895.14s -> 7896.97s]  Come on, get it right.
[7896.97s -> 7904.62s]  That can't be a good sign.
[7904.62s -> 7905.42s]  So we now have to...
[7907.10s -> 7908.22s]  Oh, I didn't even give it a chance.
[7916.30s -> 7916.70s]  Laughing?
[7927.85s -> 7929.13s]  I don't know, it's been a long time.
[7930.09s -> 7932.78s]  Is this going to be Joe or Charlie or...
[7935.35s -> 7938.71s]  Charles T. Perez from Boston.
[7940.87s -> 7941.67s]  All right.
[7941.67s -> 7942.55s]  This is Charlie.
[7947.59s -> 7948.15s]  Anything else?
[7956.71s -> 7957.03s]  Okay.
[7957.67s -> 7960.22s]  Oh, fuck.
[7963.75s -> 7965.43s]  Yeah, that's fucking Charlie.
[7977.62s -> 7977.94s]  Oh, no.
[7977.94s -> 7979.14s]  Now I'm actually alone.
[7980.30s -> 7981.34s]  Now I'm really alone.
[7984.07s -> 7984.47s]  Hello?
[7985.19s -> 7985.51s]  You can't...
[7988.73s -> 7991.21s]  No, I don't want to be actually alone.
[7991.21s -> 7995.56s]  What the fuck?
[8000.36s -> 8001.08s]  Is Brad dead?
[8001.64s -> 8003.10s]  That means Brad's dead.
[8021.72s -> 8022.60s]  Quickly.
[8022.60s -> 8026.66s]  Get the tooth.
[8027.22s -> 8032.10s]  Shit.
[8032.10s -> 8033.85s]  My phone's ringing.
[8045.53s -> 8045.93s]  Hello?
[8048.82s -> 8049.22s]  Uh-oh.
[8050.50s -> 8051.62s]  Oh, wait, what?
[8052.26s -> 8054.14s]  What do I do about this?
[8064.36s -> 8064.76s]  Is it...
[8065.86s -> 8066.18s]  What?
[8066.74s -> 8068.62s]  I can get out.
[8068.62s -> 8069.26s]  I can get out of this.
[8069.26s -> 8069.90s]  I can get out of this.
[8072.04s -> 8073.00s]  I'm gonna be fine.
[8073.00s -> 8073.80s]  I can get out of this.
[8079.00s -> 8079.64s]  Where was he?
[8080.52s -> 8081.08s]  Where were you?
[8083.37s -> 8084.01s]  Uh, safe...
[8086.82s -> 8087.54s]  Do I run?
[8087.54s -> 8088.10s]  Save Brad.
[8088.74s -> 8089.59s]  Save Brad.
[8096.34s -> 8096.98s]  Is that made up?
[8104.44s -> 8111.13s]  Was it just...
[8111.13s -> 8111.77s]  That was fake?
[8120.65s -> 8122.33s]  He was just telling another scary story.
[8122.33s -> 8122.65s]  What?
[8122.65s -> 8123.61s]  I don't understand what just happened.
[8128.15s -> 8128.79s]  So he died.
[8130.04s -> 8130.52s]  Or is he?
[8131.24s -> 8132.44s]  Because he was a ghost before.
[8132.44s -> 8133.08s]  But then he wasn't.
[8133.08s -> 8133.72s]  And then he was.
[8134.44s -> 8143.86s]  On here.
[8143.86s -> 8144.34s]  Free blood.
[8145.83s -> 8146.87s]  Nice, okay.
[8146.87s -> 8147.27s]  How do I...
[8147.27s -> 8147.91s]  How do I drink it?
[8148.55s -> 8152.82s]  I get like a cup or something?
[8152.82s -> 8153.06s]  That's...
[8153.78s -> 8154.90s]  That's pretty good.
[8156.73s -> 8156.97s]  Nice.
[8157.61s -> 8158.01s]  I'll have to...
[8158.01s -> 8158.57s]  I'll remember that.
[8159.29s -> 8161.94s]  Probably get some like health back or something.
[8162.58s -> 8166.22s]  Wait, I'm gonna play piano.
[8177.94s -> 8178.74s]  Open door in the back.
[8178.74s -> 8179.70s]  But wait, there's a...
[8180.34s -> 8180.82s]  Snacks?
[8181.62s -> 8186.57s]  What is this?
[8187.13s -> 8190.62s]  It's a book.
[8192.12s -> 8193.64s]  It's got all kinds of symbols on it.
[8193.64s -> 8194.12s]  It's a...
[8194.12s -> 8195.08s]  It's a Satan book.
[8195.72s -> 8196.68s]  That's a Satan book.
[8196.68s -> 8197.00s]  Okay.
[8198.49s -> 8198.73s]  Yeah.
[8199.29s -> 8207.42s]  All should silently assemble in no more or fewer than five true individuals of sound,
[8207.42s -> 8208.38s]  mind, and spirit.
[8208.38s -> 8212.30s]  It should number three female and two male, firstborn, faces obscured with blood.
[8214.38s -> 8218.06s]  Know it is important to the sorcerer and the spiritual well-being flock
[8218.78s -> 8224.70s]  that before the festival of Akra Mahamarai Ken,
[8225.42s -> 8231.74s]  ritual of Threskeia is performed to went away demons by means of Kabal.
[8234.07s -> 8239.03s]  The pentacle shall be drawn and each member shall stand at each of the five primary points.
[8239.03s -> 8241.59s]  A lady born of the sea shall be rendered unconscious
[8241.59s -> 8243.11s]  and placed at the center of the pentacle.
[8243.67s -> 8247.51s]  It is from there that the assembled should recite the incantation of a Sorus
[8248.55s -> 8253.11s]  sword in hand with all exhaustion possible as is written,
[8253.11s -> 8256.71s]  we five stand at the furthest point where yet close enough to touch.
[8257.43s -> 8260.95s]  The five starred, great power turning 90 degrees to yore
[8260.95s -> 8263.51s]  to describe the unicursal out.
[8263.51s -> 8267.27s]  The pentacle is faith soared forward in using rents.
[8268.07s -> 8275.99s]  Turn degrees to describe a covernal signal constitutes the with reverence.
[8275.99s -> 8279.75s]  Turn to face north with exhaustion exclaim.
[8280.31s -> 8288.10s]  Some words missing there?
[8290.50s -> 8290.82s]  All right.
[8290.82s -> 8298.06s]  This is important stuff here to rid the unfortunate body of its unclean blood
[8298.70s -> 8301.58s]  skull dagger blood tree.
[8302.14s -> 8303.90s]  Remember those.
[8305.72s -> 8312.38s]  The body should be transferred to a casket of thick wood skull dagger blood tree.
[8312.38s -> 8316.58s]  I got blood sacrifice.
[8316.58s -> 8318.49s]  Is there more?
[8322.55s -> 8322.79s]  All right.
[8322.79s -> 8325.43s]  We got to have the skull, the dagger, the blood in the tree.
[8326.07s -> 8329.62s]  The sword forward.
[8329.62s -> 8330.18s]  You, Brad?
[8331.74s -> 8336.46s]  No, I'm reading a long, long, long thing that we need to, we got to have.
[8336.46s -> 8336.70s]  Okay.
[8337.26s -> 8337.50s]  Sorry.
[8337.50s -> 8339.74s]  I didn't realize I was, I thought I was looking at you anyway.
[8339.74s -> 8340.38s]  No.
[8340.38s -> 8340.86s]  Carry on.
[8340.86s -> 8341.34s]  Carry on.
[8344.04s -> 8345.48s]  Hey, are you Brad?
[8345.48s -> 8348.60s]  He's like, he's, he's in my game now and he's like being fucking weird.
[8348.60s -> 8350.44s]  I just want to make sure that's not you.
[8350.44s -> 8356.39s]  It's like, I got a weird phone call like a few hours ago and it kind of sounded like
[8356.39s -> 8357.51s]  your voice, you pranking me.
[8357.51s -> 8359.35s]  Just want to make sure it's, just tell me.
[8360.92s -> 8362.20s]  The pentacle is sacrifice.
[8362.20s -> 8363.00s]  Page 34.
[8363.00s -> 8368.50s]  Each member takes a step inward and then is still in the stance of Ram.
[8368.50s -> 8370.31s]  Reciting unison.
[8370.31s -> 8372.47s]  We are one and so is the Lord.
[8372.47s -> 8373.43s]  Oh, sore us.
[8373.43s -> 8376.87s]  But the sacrifice we ask you to cleanse our aura to rid us of the demons that plague us.
[8377.51s -> 8379.27s]  We spill the life of man in your honor.
[8379.83s -> 8382.55s]  That we may ourselves worthy of your trust.
[8383.35s -> 8389.99s]  Only when the in can let should the five converge upon the S as drawn.
[8390.55s -> 8392.31s]  Each member should in turn to rid.
[8392.31s -> 8392.95s]  Okay.
[8392.95s -> 8393.59s]  Good.
[8393.59s -> 8397.08s]  Throw it in the fire.
[8402.55s -> 8403.83s]  Blood investigate.
[8408.01s -> 8408.89s]  Hey, are you Brad?
[8409.69s -> 8409.85s]  Yeah.
[8409.85s -> 8412.81s]  Somebody joined our server and they're named, they're named Brad.
[8414.02s -> 8414.42s]  Yeah.
[8414.42s -> 8415.06s]  They're griefing.
[8415.62s -> 8416.34s]  It's not you, right?
[8416.34s -> 8417.46s]  Tell me if it's you.
[8417.46s -> 8422.22s]  Anything else on here?
[8422.78s -> 8425.54s]  No.
[8425.54s -> 8426.74s]  Where's that piano?
[8426.82s -> 8433.16s]  I want to play.
[8433.16s -> 8434.68s]  There has to be something with like the piano keys.
[8446.15s -> 8446.63s]  I knew it.
[8465.77s -> 8470.92s]  I just stopped playing like a fucking evanescence.
[8475.45s -> 8476.41s]  What was that?
[8476.41s -> 8481.62s]  What are you talking about?
[8481.62s -> 8484.18s]  You guys didn't, everybody learned how to do that.
[8484.18s -> 8485.14s]  Am I too old for that?
[8485.14s -> 8486.26s]  You guys, you guys might be too young.
[8487.22s -> 8489.14s]  Every single person learned how to do the
[8490.74s -> 8495.58s]  because that was like the most popular song in the world.
[8506.90s -> 8511.74s]  So go turn on the power.
[8512.38s -> 8517.53s]  Hooray.
[8517.53s -> 8518.01s]  Hooray.
[8518.01s -> 8518.49s]  Hooray.
[8518.49s -> 8519.37s]  The thing's gonna go up.
[8519.37s -> 8520.25s]  This is gonna be so fair.
[8520.25s -> 8520.65s]  I knew it.
[8525.86s -> 8526.18s]  Geez.
[8527.61s -> 8527.93s]  Really?
[8539.19s -> 8540.87s]  Yeah, probably incoming re here.
[8540.87s -> 8541.75s]  This is blood.
[8553.27s -> 8553.75s]  The skull.
[8554.47s -> 8555.91s]  I knew we were going to get read.
[8558.94s -> 8559.58s]  Just grab it.
[8567.59s -> 8568.47s]  Take the skull.
[8571.53s -> 8579.26s]  What are you doing?
[8579.26s -> 8580.38s]  Get the skull.
[8580.38s -> 8591.88s]  All right.
[8591.88s -> 8594.60s]  Apparently I can't pick up the skull, which I know I need it.
[8595.16s -> 8602.55s]  Blood coming from the ceiling.
[8612.74s -> 8625.64s]  Well, just remember that there's a skull in there outside the boat.
[8634.74s -> 8638.22s]  Can I just jump over?
[8648.46s -> 8650.54s]  And what was I supposed to see something?
[8650.54s -> 8652.47s]  What was I supposed to see?
[8658.44s -> 8661.29s]  Wait, this is the same room.
[8661.29s -> 8671.80s]  So give me the skull.
[8671.80s -> 8673.48s]  This is the box in the beginning of the game.
[8673.48s -> 8687.00s]  That's the gold.
[8687.00s -> 8688.92s]  Oh, so it's a gold.
[8688.92s -> 8690.52s]  There's gold in there.
[8690.52s -> 8695.26s]  Gold bars, gold coins.
[8695.90s -> 8697.42s]  And the government was trying to keep it.
[8697.42s -> 8700.22s]  And it's a conspiracy.
[8700.22s -> 8707.10s]  Okay, this is the water coming down.
[8707.10s -> 8707.74s]  Interesting.
[8709.02s -> 8713.69s]  Cool.
[8715.58s -> 8717.74s]  Should I not be standing in this like gas?
[8722.17s -> 8723.21s]  Did I go back in time?
[8724.66s -> 8725.70s]  Where's Brad?
[8725.70s -> 8748.28s]  It's the same book, right?
[8751.24s -> 8752.52s]  This is the Satan book.
[8752.52s -> 8756.41s]  Standard operating procedure for handling hazardous chemicals.
[8757.29s -> 8758.25s]  Department for...
[8758.25s -> 8758.89s]  It sure is.
[8759.61s -> 8767.05s]  Avoid storing chemicals.
[8767.78s -> 8770.66s]  Leaks the wire rope clean and stored in any chemicals.
[8770.66s -> 8771.38s]  Make certain that...
[8773.59s -> 8774.07s]  What?
[8774.07s -> 8779.29s]  Its color band is...
[8779.29s -> 8780.09s]  Make certain that...
[8781.21s -> 8782.41s]  It's properly marked before.
[8783.21s -> 8787.05s]  Its color band is visible so the cargo can be identified quickly.
[8787.05s -> 8788.65s]  Refer to paragraph 26B.
[8789.61s -> 8792.25s]  The cargo must be secured to avoid movement during passage.
[8793.05s -> 8796.57s]  Pass the stowage with fresh water.
[8798.04s -> 8800.12s]  Grease to drums help protect them.
[8800.68s -> 8801.96s]  Water during stowage.

[8810.17s -> 8811.69s]  And consult the Navy shipment.
[8811.69s -> 8813.61s]  Marking handbook if required to determine.
[8814.25s -> 8817.77s]  Why am I reading this shit?
[8817.77s -> 8819.05s]  Because I don't know.
[8819.05s -> 8819.93s]  It might be important.
[8822.94s -> 8823.98s]  Is it not important?
[8824.62s -> 8827.14s]  Why would I read this shit?
[8828.82s -> 8830.34s]  I feel like this is important stuff.
[8831.14s -> 8835.75s]  Does it look important?
[8837.34s -> 8838.22s]  I don't know.
[8839.18s -> 8846.34s]  What do you mean does it look important?
[8846.34s -> 8848.58s]  It's a hazardous chemical removal.
[8848.58s -> 8849.94s]  Yes, it is very important.
[8850.50s -> 8869.02s]  Another dead person.
[8874.89s -> 8875.45s]  Wait, this is...
[8875.45s -> 8876.73s]  Wait, wait, this is where Charlie was.
[8879.06s -> 8879.56s]  Uh-oh.
[8886.81s -> 8887.53s]  Now it...
[8887.53s -> 8890.83s]  What?
[8891.45s -> 8892.57s]  There's the guy with the hat on.
[8893.53s -> 8899.66s]  It's...
[8899.66s -> 8900.86s]  Oh, there's Brad.
[8900.86s -> 8902.58s]  Hey, are you Brad?
[8903.38s -> 8903.86s]  Just like...
[8903.86s -> 8904.34s]  I'm just...
[8904.34s -> 8904.82s]  I need to know.
[8906.78s -> 8907.42s]  Brad.
[8907.42s -> 8907.98s]  Are you Brad?
[8907.98s -> 8909.42s]  Can I tell you this information?
[8911.50s -> 8911.98s]  Can I...
[8911.98s -> 8912.62s]  What?
[8912.62s -> 8913.26s]  Are you trying to...
[8913.26s -> 8915.90s]  All right, mute, mute, mute, mute, mute, mute.
[8916.86s -> 8919.46s]  Hey, what's wrong?
[8922.36s -> 8923.32s]  What the fuck?
[8923.96s -> 8926.04s]  Did I make this in the movies?
[8947.69s -> 8948.73s]  Wait, did I...
[8948.73s -> 8949.69s]  I spoiled it?
[8967.77s -> 8968.97s]  Hey, are you Brad?
[8975.06s -> 8977.62s]  Well, he asked me earlier if I was Brad.
[8977.62s -> 8979.38s]  I was confirming the same thing with him.
[8990.71s -> 8992.63s]  We both spoiled each other's game?
[8993.27s -> 8996.54s]  No, we didn't.
[8999.53s -> 9001.05s]  W doesn't exist?
[9001.05s -> 9001.93s]  What the fuck?
[9002.89s -> 9004.41s]  I am so mad right now.
[9004.41s -> 9004.89s]  I think...
[9004.89s -> 9005.61s]  I think I killed him.
[9006.25s -> 9013.06s]  What is happening?
[9013.06s -> 9014.34s]  I can't move the controller.
[9027.06s -> 9029.30s]  It's switching from keyboard to fucking controller.
[9030.98s -> 9031.54s]  On a whim.
[9032.18s -> 9033.06s]  When it decides to.
[9060.15s -> 9060.87s]  All right.
[9060.87s -> 9095.85s]  You okay?
[9097.67s -> 9098.63s]  That guy saved you.
[9099.59s -> 9101.72s]  He tried to kill me.
[9102.44s -> 9103.56s]  Thanks.
[9104.18s -> 9105.90s]  I could have drowned.
[9105.90s -> 9109.59s]  I can't believe it.
[9109.59s -> 9110.23s]  You killed him.
[9111.03s -> 9111.99s]  You killed him.
[9111.99s -> 9112.49s]  I did.
[9114.57s -> 9115.21s]  No, I didn't.
[9115.21s -> 9115.71s]  He's fine.
[9117.05s -> 9159.21s]  Now I'm back here.
[9159.21s -> 9159.71s]  Okay.
[9160.17s -> 9165.61s]  Hey, are you Brad?
[9165.61s -> 9166.65s]  Brad's in front of me right now.
[9166.65s -> 9167.21s]  I'm just...
[9167.21s -> 9169.53s]  Listen, I don't know anything that's happening.
[9170.57s -> 9171.29s]  I'm just kidding.
[9171.29s -> 9172.09s]  I'm kidding.
[9172.09s -> 9173.29s]  It's weird.
[9173.29s -> 9175.29s]  I have no clue what's going on.
[9176.25s -> 9179.45s]  Not in like the good way either.
[9179.45s -> 9181.21s]  Like the literally just...
[9181.21s -> 9182.57s]  And fucking keyboard.
[9182.57s -> 9182.81s]  All right.
[9182.81s -> 9183.37s]  I got to mute.
[9184.41s -> 9185.72s]  Wait.
[9185.72s -> 9186.20s]  No, that's you.
[9186.20s -> 9186.60s]  That's you.
[9186.60s -> 9187.00s]  That is you.
[9189.50s -> 9190.54s]  No, that's not you.
[9190.54s -> 9191.10s]  Are you Brad?
[9193.53s -> 9194.49s]  Stop asking that.
[9195.93s -> 9196.25s]  All right.
[9196.25s -> 9197.21s]  You have to sit on board.
[9212.52s -> 9215.74s]  All right.
[9215.74s -> 9217.74s]  I'm understanding what's happening in this game.
[9218.30s -> 9220.38s]  So we're not supposed to be working together.
[9222.98s -> 9224.82s]  Us doing this in co-op.
[9224.90s -> 9226.18s]  It was like a bad idea.
[9226.74s -> 9229.16s]  We were supposed to just like be playing together.
[9229.16s -> 9230.20s]  Like, hey, what do you find?
[9230.20s -> 9231.64s]  What'd you find over there?
[9231.64s -> 9243.94s]  Are we Brad?
[9244.58s -> 9251.99s]  No, I realized that like 20 minutes ago.
[9258.04s -> 9261.48s]  I realized that after he asked me if I was Brad.
[9262.12s -> 9263.24s]  And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[9263.24s -> 9263.88s]  And then I had...
[9263.88s -> 9265.00s]  And then he was Brad.
[9265.00s -> 9265.48s]  You know what I mean?
[9266.36s -> 9267.88s]  That was a cycle that we were in.
[9271.98s -> 9277.46s]  And yes, I know that hitting the key is changing the keyboard.
[9277.46s -> 9278.26s]  I know.
[9291.06s -> 9294.10s]  Guys, I knew that after the first 200 people said it.
[9294.97s -> 9313.83s]  But really, why is it taking so long?
[9313.83s -> 9315.43s]  Just can't open this thing by myself.
[9321.00s -> 9322.28s]  Alex has found his secret.
[9323.72s -> 9325.48s]  See, we went into this thing and it was going to be like,
[9325.48s -> 9327.40s]  oh, it's like a co-op horror experience.
[9328.12s -> 9330.20s]  No, we're actively playing like against each other.
[9330.20s -> 9331.08s]  And we just don't even know.
[9337.53s -> 9338.81s]  Mad because Brad.
[9346.68s -> 9351.96s]  Because we like aren't supposed to be sharing information with each other then.
[9351.96s -> 9352.52s]  You know what I mean?
[9353.08s -> 9357.93s]  It's going to be lobster under here, I hope.
[9358.49s -> 9382.66s]  Yeah, we're like hallucinating.
[9382.66s -> 9384.02s]  The monster and somebody...
[9384.02s -> 9386.26s]  Oh, no, you're the monster.
[9386.26s -> 9387.38s]  You just strangled that guy.
[9387.38s -> 9387.86s]  You killed...
[9388.42s -> 9389.22s]  That's not Brad.
[9389.22s -> 9389.70s]  That's me.
[9390.70s -> 9391.58s]  That's not a monster.
[9391.58s -> 9391.98s]  It's me.
[9399.91s -> 9406.25s]  Just like it was in the beginning of the game.
[9406.25s -> 9410.62s]  Oh, what's it have?
[9426.66s -> 9428.10s]  Mad because Brad.
[9441.24s -> 9442.20s]  That's fucking funny.
[9444.17s -> 9444.89s]  That's a good one.
[9446.10s -> 9448.34s]  All right, let's use the key in the safe.
[9449.14s -> 9463.83s]  All right, what does it say?
[9463.83s -> 9466.68s]  What does it say?
[9467.40s -> 9467.80s]  Read it.
[9470.49s -> 9471.53s]  Not read the letter.
[9472.09s -> 9474.54s]  I thought saves don't use keys.
[9474.54s -> 9474.94s]  They don't...
[9475.50s -> 9478.15s]  I mean, maybe back in like the fucking 20s.
[9482.57s -> 9484.49s]  Summary of Manchurian Gold.
[9484.49s -> 9488.65s]  Study of response of human beings to ingesting chemical designate Manchurian Gold.
[9489.29s -> 9491.00s]  Okay.
[9491.72s -> 9496.12s]  Chemical ingesting crystal dust form by subjects A, B, C, D, and E.
[9497.29s -> 9500.01s]  All volunteers provided by base sergeant.
[9504.66s -> 9505.46s]  Test successful.
[9505.46s -> 9510.10s]  Results consistent with biological specimen test reports in supplied files.
[9510.66s -> 9512.22s]  Full report forthcoming.
[9512.22s -> 9515.42s]  Further studies strongly recommend a stimulus response relationship
[9515.42s -> 9516.94s]  in subjects under influence of chemical.
[9518.12s -> 9521.00s]  Please note, latest test results do not supersede...
[9521.00s -> 9524.52s]  So the Manchurian Gold is just a bunch of unstable chemicals.
[9526.04s -> 9530.12s]  High caution must be taken to avoid exposure of chemicals to solution,
[9530.12s -> 9531.40s]  extreme heat, and electricity.
[9533.83s -> 9534.71s]  Five subjects.
[9536.33s -> 9537.61s]  Right, okay.
[9537.69s -> 9549.45s]  All right, where else should I go?
[9550.33s -> 9555.72s]  Can I go in any of these other doors?
[9561.38s -> 9561.86s]  Pause the game.
[9561.86s -> 9562.98s]  I gotta fill my water bottle.
[9563.62s -> 9571.90s]  Oh, God.
[9575.27s -> 9575.67s]  It's me.
[9580.68s -> 9581.16s]  Hello?
[9581.16s -> 9582.20s]  Oh, it's me.
[9582.20s -> 9582.76s]  It's Bliss.
[9582.76s -> 9583.24s]  It's okay.
[9590.02s -> 9590.90s]  This is Italian.
[9594.52s -> 9595.88s]  Should I even say...
[9595.88s -> 9596.44s]  Are you Brad?
[9597.56s -> 9599.40s]  Like, I keep running into Brad.
[9614.92s -> 9615.48s]  No, but he...
[9615.48s -> 9615.96s]  Okay.
[9615.96s -> 9616.84s]  But he doesn't know.
[9618.04s -> 9619.24s]  So he's gonna like kill me.
[9621.50s -> 9622.46s]  What's going on with that light?
[9623.18s -> 9625.93s]  I just missed the QTE because of that.
[9636.14s -> 9637.42s]  I'm just chasing him down.
[9651.18s -> 9651.82s]  It's me.
[9651.82s -> 9652.46s]  It's Bliss.
[9652.46s -> 9653.18s]  I see.
[9653.18s -> 9654.22s]  I know what's happening.
[9655.98s -> 9668.62s]  So I'm reading this thing here.
[9668.62s -> 9669.66s]  It says that this...
[9671.43s -> 9673.03s]  It says like a pentagram on it and shit.
[9673.03s -> 9675.03s]  I'm like, I've been reading it for like 40 minutes.
[9675.03s -> 9676.31s]  It seems like pretty important.
[9678.30s -> 9679.90s]  Yeah, it's weird.
[9679.90s -> 9680.70s]  Because in my game...
[9681.98s -> 9682.70s]  What have you been doing?
[9683.91s -> 9686.63s]  I've been like really just bored reading material.
[9686.63s -> 9688.95s]  Well, see, me and the other character are playing checkers.
[9689.99s -> 9692.71s]  We said whoever loses has to cook dinner tonight.
[9694.73s -> 9695.85s]  Oh, that's weird.
[9696.81s -> 9697.05s]  All right.
[9697.05s -> 9699.61s]  I'm gonna get back to reading, I guess.
[9700.65s -> 9701.13s]  Yeah.
[9701.13s -> 9702.57s]  No, there's a lot of books in the game.
[9702.57s -> 9703.77s]  There are too many books.
[9703.77s -> 9704.81s]  It's like kind of ridiculous.
[9706.94s -> 9708.14s]  But it's all good.
[9708.78s -> 9710.41s]  This one here.
[9711.21s -> 9713.27s]  You're gonna get ca-
[9713.27s -> 9715.46s]  This one here.
[9715.46s -> 9716.58s]  This is too long.
[9716.58s -> 9718.18s]  I'm just gonna leave this room, guys.
[9718.18s -> 9719.22s]  It's like way too long.
[9720.10s -> 9729.70s]  I guess I'll try to play piano again.
[9742.50s -> 9743.54s]  I almost missed that.
[9759.99s -> 9761.35s]  Should I stop like-
[9761.35s -> 9761.75s]  It's weird.
[9761.75s -> 9762.55s]  Like I'm at the buffet.
[9763.51s -> 9764.52s]  You're at a buffet.
[9764.52s -> 9768.84s]  There's a bunch of like just elderly cruise liner type buffet people here.
[9768.84s -> 9771.56s]  Just clamoring for the free cheeseburger line.
[9772.52s -> 9774.49s]  This game's fucking boring, then.
[9775.21s -> 9777.37s]  Because I'm literally just walking around the same room.
[9779.83s -> 9781.19s]  Playing the fucking piano.
[9781.19s -> 9782.07s]  It's like terrible.
[9786.42s -> 9787.38s]  I didn't think it was this boring.
[9788.26s -> 9792.14s]  Is it?
[9792.14s -> 9793.10s]  Somebody's in the window.
[9793.74s -> 9794.86s]  You got somebody in the window?
[9796.22s -> 9796.78s]  What the fuck?
[9797.50s -> 9799.38s]  There's a face in the window here.
[9828.95s -> 9829.67s]  Fresh air.
[9829.67s -> 9830.15s]  Yeah, that's right.
[9837.51s -> 9838.63s]  I'm still in the-
[9838.63s -> 9839.43s]  Wait, what the fuck was that?
[9839.99s -> 9843.82s]  I've been in a loading screen for like five minutes.
[9843.82s -> 9844.62s]  What the fuck is that?
[9845.50s -> 9846.76s]  Oh, it's Brad.
[9846.76s -> 9847.16s]  Are you Brad?
[9847.16s -> 9847.88s]  Are you controlling Brad?
[9847.88s -> 9849.00s]  He's in the piano room with me now.
[9850.36s -> 9853.64s]  Actually, I found out if you just don't play the game for about five minutes,
[9854.28s -> 9855.48s]  the AI takes over.
[9858.01s -> 9858.65s]  All right.
[9858.65s -> 9859.21s]  It's us.
[9859.21s -> 9860.17s]  This is us.
[9860.17s -> 9860.65s]  Get ready.
[9872.63s -> 9873.83s]  Am I Alex or are you Alex?
[9873.83s -> 9874.31s]  Who was it?
[9875.27s -> 9876.23s]  I am Julia.
[9877.03s -> 9877.91s]  Okay, so I'm Alex.
[9878.71s -> 9882.26s]  Imagine maybe to look at your feet to walk up the stairs.
[9882.82s -> 9886.02s]  Like imagine if you look at your hands when you punch the keys on the keyboard.
[9886.02s -> 9893.64s]  I can barely hear you over this.
[9896.63s -> 9896.87s]  Jump.
[9897.91s -> 9898.63s]  That's what I did too.
[9899.19s -> 9899.99s]  That's what I did too.
[9900.71s -> 9915.46s]  I don't know if you're actually Alex.
[9916.34s -> 9916.98s]  Oh, you are.
[9916.98s -> 9917.30s]  Okay.
[9917.30s -> 9918.18s]  You're deciding.
[9919.14s -> 9919.78s]  Yeah, we're going.
[9930.10s -> 9930.58s]  Harm Rad.
[9931.70s -> 9933.24s]  Help me.
[9934.04s -> 9935.59s]  Close it.
[9935.59s -> 9935.99s]  Lock it.
[9940.33s -> 9940.97s]  Work.
[9940.97s -> 9941.61s]  Nice job.
[9946.17s -> 9946.81s]  Are you Brad?
[9949.29s -> 9949.77s]  Am I Brad?
[9949.77s -> 9950.57s]  Are you Brad?
[9950.57s -> 9951.13s]  You have to be.
[9951.69s -> 9952.97s]  There's so many people.
[9962.30s -> 9963.10s]  Who's Brad?
[9964.06s -> 9968.38s]  Oh, we're playing in five player mode the whole time.
[9969.66s -> 9974.01s]  We've only been controlling one character each.
[9974.01s -> 9975.85s]  So we're all, everyone's still alive.
[9975.85s -> 9977.77s]  We did a phenomenal fucking job.
[9978.49s -> 9979.05s]  Chad is Brad.
[9982.70s -> 9993.80s]  So by the way, there was a period about five minutes that I was not here during the last chapter.
[9995.26s -> 9995.98s]  I was gone.
[9995.98s -> 9997.02s]  You were actually gone.
[9997.02s -> 9997.66s]  Oh, hello.
[9997.66s -> 9997.82s]  Yeah.
[9999.00s -> 10004.36s]  Things appear to have taken a turn towards the spiritual, wouldn't you say?
[10004.36s -> 10005.00s]  Were you Brad?
[10006.78s -> 10007.90s]  I mean that sincerely.
[10007.90s -> 10009.26s]  Like the chapter's over.
[10009.26s -> 10009.66s]  Okay.
[10009.66s -> 10010.14s]  Like.
[10010.14s -> 10010.54s]  Yeah.
[10010.54s -> 10011.26s]  Chapter's over.
[10011.26s -> 10011.74s]  Are you Brad?
[10014.42s -> 10015.94s]  I was Brad for a time.
[10016.98s -> 10018.82s]  Brad made some questionable decisions.
[10018.82s -> 10020.12s]  How to stop it.
[10020.12s -> 10023.72s]  How to save the lives of your four unfortunate stowaways.
[10024.98s -> 10026.74s]  You will, I hope.
[10026.74s -> 10027.62s]  They said four?
[10027.62s -> 10030.98s]  Although it seems the ship's previous occupants never managed to.
[10032.52s -> 10034.68s]  Quite a lot of deaths that night.
[10035.32s -> 10038.73s]  Let me help you out.
[10038.73s -> 10039.85s]  Give you a little hint.
[10039.85s -> 10041.21s]  Need a Brad flow chart.
[10043.91s -> 10044.95s]  No, I don't.
[10044.95s -> 10045.67s]  No spoilers.
[10045.67s -> 10046.31s]  Get out of here.
[10047.67s -> 10048.47s]  No hint.
[10049.35s -> 10053.78s]  Perhaps you think you can piece things together from the clues you found yourself.
[10054.74s -> 10056.02s]  Good luck with that.
[10056.90s -> 10061.70s]  Perhaps you've started to realize something.
[10061.70s -> 10066.10s]  This is just the guy that binge watched the whole season before you've had time to sit down and watch.
[10066.74s -> 10068.42s]  He may not be dying.
[10068.42s -> 10069.38s]  Talk about what he thinks.
[10071.22s -> 10071.86s]  Whoa!
[10071.86s -> 10072.74s]  I hope that helps.
[10072.74s -> 10074.34s]  Welcome to Pell and Tell or Fool Us.
[10075.14s -> 10075.78s]  At Fool Us.
[10075.78s -> 10080.18s]  Well, I'm so excited to find out what your poor unfortunates are making of all this and how
[10080.18s -> 10083.62s]  you might avoid any more unnecessary tragedy.
[10084.42s -> 10085.22s]  Go on.
[10085.22s -> 10085.78s]  Back to it.
[10086.97s -> 10087.69s]  Speak soon.
[10092.92s -> 10093.72s]  Panda Fate 3.
[10094.52s -> 10096.09s]  Have fun.
[10097.74s -> 10098.54s]  Okay.
[10098.54s -> 10099.26s]  We know who we are.
[10099.90s -> 10102.68s]  What the hell is wrong with you back there?
[10102.68s -> 10103.64s]  I have to pee.
[10103.64s -> 10105.24s]  Brad, you lost your shit.
[10105.24s -> 10105.88s]  I did too.
[10105.88s -> 10106.84s]  That's why I was gone.
[10106.84s -> 10107.88s]  What are you talking about?
[10107.88s -> 10108.38s]  Come on.
[10108.76s -> 10109.16s]  No.
[10109.16s -> 10109.40s]  Come on.
[10109.40s -> 10110.20s]  That's ridiculous.
[10111.00s -> 10112.68s]  What the fuck is going on with this shit?
[10112.68s -> 10113.96s]  That was a pretty good Jay Leno impression.
[10113.96s -> 10115.00s]  I gotta be honest.
[10115.00s -> 10119.64s]  It feels like there's some like, like evil, like literal evil going on down there.
[10120.28s -> 10123.40s]  Let's just stay calm and relatively sane about this.
[10123.40s -> 10123.90s]  Okay?
[10124.76s -> 10125.72s]  This stuff I saw.
[10126.68s -> 10129.24s]  It's like there were these old soldiers and they were bodies.
[10129.24s -> 10130.28s]  They were dead, but then-
[10130.28s -> 10131.40s]  This is all your fault, by the way.
[10132.36s -> 10133.00s]  It might be.
[10133.00s -> 10136.04s]  Doesn't sound that crazy right about now.
[10136.04s -> 10140.28s]  If you don't ever split up, nothing bad can happen.
[10140.28s -> 10142.44s]  That shit crazy like dinosaur old.
[10142.44s -> 10145.00s]  Not that that's a bad thing, but she just like up and vanished on.
[10145.64s -> 10147.40s]  Alex wasn't the only Alex.
[10147.40s -> 10148.28s]  Who are you talking about?
[10148.84s -> 10152.28s]  There were things walking around with his face on them.
[10152.28s -> 10153.24s]  Alex's face.
[10154.44s -> 10155.32s]  It was horrifying.
[10155.32s -> 10156.28s]  Hey, whoa, whoa.
[10161.88s -> 10162.52s]  My face?
[10163.48s -> 10165.22s]  That never hurt you.
[10165.22s -> 10166.02s]  That's rude.
[10166.02s -> 10167.22s]  You know that, right?
[10167.22s -> 10167.86s]  No, I know.
[10167.86s -> 10169.54s]  It's just, let's-
[10169.54s -> 10170.34s]  No, I'm Alex.
[10170.34s -> 10170.84s]  Okay?
[10171.46s -> 10174.66s]  This place is too fucked up to just be fucked up.
[10174.66s -> 10175.38s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10176.34s -> 10178.02s]  I mean, like something is going on here.
[10179.66s -> 10182.06s]  So what do we know for sure that we can all agree on?
[10182.06s -> 10182.46s]  Chemicals.
[10182.46s -> 10183.18s]  You breathe in a minute.
[10184.54s -> 10185.90s]  It's a ghost ship.
[10185.90s -> 10186.22s]  Wow.
[10186.22s -> 10187.66s]  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[10187.66s -> 10188.86s]  Did you see a ghost or anything?
[10188.86s -> 10189.50s]  We're turning to water.
[10189.50s -> 10191.90s]  Manchurian gold isn't actually gold.
[10191.90s -> 10194.86s]  It's a fucking chemical and it's leaking all over cargo hold to-
[10195.58s -> 10198.30s]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure this isn't exactly what our
[10198.30s -> 10200.14s]  friendly fishermen are expecting either.
[10201.34s -> 10202.38s]  This should go over well.
[10207.06s -> 10209.38s]  What do you think actually happened on this ship?
[10209.38s -> 10211.70s]  A goddamn mystery box is what it is.
[10211.70s -> 10213.22s]  The ship was bound for San Francisco.
[10213.22s -> 10213.86s]  Mystery box?
[10213.86s -> 10216.58s]  But it hailed from a water purification plant in China.
[10217.14s -> 10219.62s]  Apparently that's where it picked up the Manchurian gold.
[10220.34s -> 10222.50s]  I saw 1947 on the newspaper.
[10224.66s -> 10225.78s]  Is this a ghost ship?
[10226.74s -> 10227.86s]  I mean, I guess-
[10230.12s -> 10232.28s]  Am I crazy or are we on a ghost ship?
[10232.28s -> 10234.92s]  Like ghost ships are real and this is one and we're totally on it.
[10234.92s -> 10237.24s]  And no, holy shit, we're so totally fucked.
[10238.28s -> 10239.78s]  I was going to say the same thing.
[10239.78s -> 10241.06s]  Pretty quick tonal change there.
[10241.06s -> 10244.82s]  According to this letter I found, the guards here were absolutely terrified of something.
[10244.82s -> 10245.22s]  I agree.
[10245.22s -> 10246.34s]  Everything you say, honey.
[10246.34s -> 10249.30s]  We found a note that said a bunch of guys tried to get out of guard duty
[10249.30s -> 10251.14s]  because they were really freaked out by something.
[10256.02s -> 10257.30s]  This place is weird.
[10257.30s -> 10258.82s]  There's a lot of unnatural shit going on here.
[10259.70s -> 10262.18s]  It is unsuper freaking natural.
[10262.18s -> 10264.10s]  Everything about this place is wrong.
[10264.10s -> 10265.38s]  We know more than we did before.
[10266.50s -> 10267.94s]  That's something at least.
[10267.94s -> 10269.38s]  We're wasting time.
[10269.38s -> 10270.90s]  Whatever we do, we have to do it now.
[10271.62s -> 10272.66s]  Time to get off this ship.
[10273.30s -> 10275.86s]  We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.
[10275.86s -> 10277.06s]  The duke needs it to run.
[10277.06s -> 10277.56s]  Nope.
[10278.02s -> 10278.50s]  Hold on.
[10278.50s -> 10279.62s]  We can leave it.
[10279.62s -> 10281.62s]  This ship's gotta have a radio.
[10281.62s -> 10282.74s]  Time for the radio quest.
[10282.74s -> 10284.10s]  If we can find it and use it.
[10285.30s -> 10287.14s]  That's great, but do you think it still works?
[10287.70s -> 10289.54s]  We just need to find a way up there.
[10289.54s -> 10291.14s]  Time for the radio fetch quest.
[10296.78s -> 10300.71s]  All right, we got the whole party here.
[10306.76s -> 10308.36s]  Okay, I'm Alex.
[10308.92s -> 10310.28s]  We gotta get out of this damn ship.
[10311.56s -> 10312.44s]  No shit.
[10312.44s -> 10314.84s]  It's a classic problem.
[10314.84s -> 10315.88s]  Who am I?
[10315.88s -> 10317.16s]  Totally effed.
[10317.16s -> 10318.20s]  You're Alex, okay.
[10318.20s -> 10319.32s]  Yeah, I am Alex.
[10319.32s -> 10320.36s]  Okay, you were just Alex.
[10320.36s -> 10323.32s]  I walked into a corner, but I thought you were walking into a corner.
[10323.32s -> 10325.16s]  Yeah, this is why I was confused.
[10325.16s -> 10329.88s]  Because you were Alex 15 seconds ago, and then it just gave me control over Alex.
[10330.44s -> 10333.40s]  Yeah, I've been told in local mode you get to pick who you want to be.
[10334.36s -> 10336.12s]  It's weird that you don't just pick who you want to be.
[10336.76s -> 10337.96s]  Yeah, why can't we just choose?
[10343.26s -> 10344.14s]  Cigar?
[10344.14s -> 10350.25s]  I know it sounds crazy, but maybe it was these guns that took down the plane from our dive.
[10353.29s -> 10355.13s]  I guess I'm just standing over your shoulder.
[10355.13s -> 10356.33s]  Am I handing this to you?
[10358.98s -> 10359.48s]  Have we?
[10361.30s -> 10363.38s]  Did you just pass the lore baton to me?
[10366.10s -> 10367.30s]  Here, you look at this.
[10367.30s -> 10368.26s]  Oh, you put this back.
[10368.26s -> 10368.82s]  I'm done with this.
[10368.82s -> 10369.94s]  I didn't even say anything.
[10371.62s -> 10373.30s]  Not even one line of dialogue.
[10373.30s -> 10375.06s]  Just I set it back down for you.
[10375.06s -> 10376.42s]  Yeah, you put this away.
[10377.54s -> 10379.46s]  Honey, I left my play chat again for dinner.
[10379.46s -> 10379.78s]  Thank you.
[10381.46s -> 10382.71s]  Can you clean them up now?
[10387.27s -> 10388.23s]  We could use this boat.
[10392.78s -> 10393.26s]  Great.
[10393.26s -> 10394.68s]  Do I have to come?
[10394.68s -> 10394.92s]  Do I have to come?
[10394.92s -> 10398.54s]  Confirm.
[10398.54s -> 10399.90s]  All right, it's got holes in it.
[10399.90s -> 10401.02s]  Let's go get some duct tape.
[10401.74s -> 10411.78s]  You can put duct tape on it.
[10411.78s -> 10413.14s]  All the characters are together.
[10413.14s -> 10416.18s]  Seems like they should exchange everything that they've learned so far.
[10418.06s -> 10419.74s]  We're silently just walking around.
[10425.50s -> 10428.22s]  It just feels like really empty in these parts where it's just
[10428.86s -> 10435.34s]  there's five people and we're all just NPC walking around.
[10439.82s -> 10443.26s]  Like, yeah, just some dialogue or some back and forth or something.
[10446.42s -> 10446.92s]  What is that?
[10453.26s -> 10455.24s]  Hey, a little help over here.
[10455.24s -> 10457.16s]  Oh, yeah, we're actually playing Spy Party now, aren't we?
[10458.12s -> 10459.48s]  I think this is our way up.
[10460.28s -> 10461.78s]  Give me a lift.
[10469.22s -> 10471.22s]  Okay, I was gonna say if there's a QTE available, fail it.
[10471.22s -> 10471.70s]  I'll pull you up.
[10473.06s -> 10483.35s]  See, there he goes.
[10483.91s -> 10486.39s]  That's like a standard NPC walk up the stairs.
[10497.66s -> 10498.14s]  My turn.
[10498.70s -> 10510.89s]  These are the heaviest characters too.
[10511.85s -> 10515.05s]  Yeah, they do feel like they're way like full of concrete.
[10515.05s -> 10516.01s]  Like there's shoes of concrete.
[10516.01s -> 10517.29s]  Don't waste your time looking.
[10517.29s -> 10518.65s]  Nope, don't go this way.
[10518.65s -> 10521.21s]  Just go the other way because there's nothing there.
[10522.01s -> 10523.77s]  We're just all walking around without mouths open.
[10524.65s -> 10532.52s]  This is where I chased Conrad before.
[10534.28s -> 10535.80s]  This is where I chased Conrad.
[10536.52s -> 10538.98s]  So that was me being chased.
[10540.87s -> 10543.72s]  Oh, that was you being chased by Conrad.
[10544.86s -> 10549.83s]  No, I was being chased as Conrad.
[10552.55s -> 10553.05s]  Wow.
[10556.74s -> 10557.24s]  Wow.
[10560.50s -> 10564.26s]  No wonder they have such a hard time.
[10564.26s -> 10564.76s]  Here we go.
[10565.62s -> 10567.94s]  We're gonna do the five person push through the door.
[10569.22s -> 10584.49s]  Jesus.
[10585.21s -> 10586.89s]  Maybe they didn't write the dialogue
[10586.89s -> 10588.65s]  because half the people that play this game
[10588.65s -> 10589.93s]  lose a character by this point.
[10589.93s -> 10590.97s]  So they just didn't.
[10590.97s -> 10591.77s]  Oh, shit.
[10591.77s -> 10592.89s]  That's right.
[10592.89s -> 10593.53s]  That's true.
[10594.41s -> 10598.65s]  Now it makes sense because they might not even be here.
[10598.65s -> 10600.49s]  Someone's supposed to be dead by now.
[10600.49s -> 10602.41s]  So let's not even write them lines.
[10602.41s -> 10603.05s]  That's true.
[10604.72s -> 10605.68s]  I didn't even think about that.
[10605.68s -> 10607.28s]  They really are just ghost NPCs
[10607.28s -> 10609.52s]  because they're not supposed to even be here potentially.
[10612.22s -> 10612.72s]  Wow.
[10615.96s -> 10616.76s]  Interesting stuff.
[10617.32s -> 10626.40s]  I really shouldn't be laughing.
[10627.36s -> 10628.88s]  But also...
[10628.88s -> 10629.60s]  Can I get out of here?
[10630.56s -> 10632.25s]  How did we leave this room?
[10633.13s -> 10633.85s]  It was funny.
[10634.57s -> 10643.64s]  What was in here?
[10643.64s -> 10646.46s]  I haven't found a radio yet.
[10646.46s -> 10648.30s]  No, but there's gotta be a radio on this shit.
[10648.30s -> 10651.08s]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[10651.08s -> 10652.44s]  Just put Julia here.
[10654.20s -> 10655.08s]  She sits there.
[10655.08s -> 10656.44s]  She's just completely out of the way.
[10657.40s -> 10658.76s]  She has no reactions.
[10658.76s -> 10660.28s]  She's not supposed to be here.
[10660.84s -> 10665.16s]  Oh, I found another book.
[10665.16s -> 10673.90s]  A blank painting.
[10674.54s -> 10676.56s]  I got Behring updated.
[10678.78s -> 10679.34s]  The world.
[10680.22s -> 10680.94s]  Secret found.
[10682.62s -> 10685.45s]  China to America.
[10686.56s -> 10687.52s]  And then we got another...
[10688.81s -> 10691.85s]  This is the boat that the beginning of the game started with.
[10692.89s -> 10695.34s]  So it was coming from China.
[10699.42s -> 10700.22s]  China to America.
[10700.22s -> 10700.94s]  And then it goes...
[10700.94s -> 10703.26s]  And then the red gets stuck over here.
[10703.26s -> 10704.06s]  That's where we are.
[10705.10s -> 10713.64s]  What is this?
[10716.60s -> 10718.04s]  Are we already separated?
[10718.04s -> 10718.92s]  Yes, I think so.
[10719.72s -> 10720.28s]  Technically.
[10720.92s -> 10721.24s]  Where else?
[10721.24s -> 10722.52s]  We're just walking around.
[10723.16s -> 10727.26s]  What does this say?
[10729.61s -> 10732.33s]  Uh, ship was blown off course.
[10732.33s -> 10733.45s]  Cloud cover was bad.
[10733.45s -> 10734.65s]  Yeah, she is just sitting there, huh?
[10734.65s -> 10735.85s]  They couldn't establish a position.
[10736.65s -> 10737.13s]  Storm.
[10737.85s -> 10739.05s]  It says lightning strikes.
[10740.25s -> 10743.68s]  Search for crew member overboard.
[10743.68s -> 10744.96s]  Search called off.
[10744.96s -> 10745.76s]  No comment.
[10745.76s -> 10746.48s]  Is this us?
[10747.20s -> 10749.00s]  I think that's us.
[10749.00s -> 10750.44s]  Funny streamer, make me laugh.
[10751.40s -> 10751.96s]  All right, fine.
[10752.60s -> 10754.44s]  No, I was just reading it.
[10757.16s -> 10759.56s]  Like you were asking me to do that?
[10759.56s -> 10760.60s]  Hey, funny streamer.
[10760.60s -> 10762.36s]  I have your stream open while I play co-op.
[10762.36s -> 10763.96s]  I'm watching your stream right now.
[10763.96s -> 10765.16s]  Do something funny.
[10765.16s -> 10766.68s]  No freaking way.
[10767.32s -> 10769.16s]  This thing actually still works?
[10769.16s -> 10772.60s]  Well, radio science hasn't changed much in seven years.
[10772.60s -> 10774.12s]  As long as there's power.
[10774.12s -> 10775.00s]  I'll give it a whirl.
[10776.28s -> 10777.48s]  How are we still getting power?
[10778.60s -> 10780.19s]  It's ghost power.
[10780.19s -> 10780.83s]  Ghost energy.
[10781.63s -> 10783.07s]  It's working.
[10783.79s -> 10784.67s]  You have to go very far.
[10786.73s -> 10787.53s]  Storm Thursday.
[10789.74s -> 10790.54s]  Beast pressure.
[10797.45s -> 10798.17s]  Oh, I skipped it.
[10798.73s -> 10799.93s]  Military battery.
[10799.93s -> 10800.49s]  You skipped it.
[10801.37s -> 10802.17s]  How do you skip it?
[10805.37s -> 10806.73s]  You skipped the cut scene?
[10806.73s -> 10808.25s]  Hey, is anyone out there hearing this?
[10808.25s -> 10809.45s]  Hit Luigi if you don't work.
[10814.59s -> 10815.79s]  Shit, we got him.
[10818.70s -> 10820.60s]  Um, coordinates.
[10821.32s -> 10822.68s]  Oh, you're the one doing this.
[10822.68s -> 10823.48s]  I see.
[10823.48s -> 10826.28s]  And I thought this was just an uninteracted cut scene.
[10827.32s -> 10829.16s]  12 degrees, 30 minutes south.
[10829.16s -> 10831.88s]  151 degrees, 20 minutes west.
[10831.88s -> 10832.68s]  How do you know all that?
[10832.68s -> 10833.40s]  Please get here now.
[10833.40s -> 10834.60s]  We need help.
[10834.60s -> 10836.36s]  Wouldn't the captain know that better?
[10836.36s -> 10836.86s]  Yeah.
[10837.66s -> 10840.93s]  Please repeat.
[10840.93s -> 10845.09s]  Are you sure you're not reading the back of the Tyson chicken nuggets?
[10852.34s -> 10855.38s]  You gotta let your finger off the button for them to talk back.
[10856.26s -> 10859.94s]  150 degrees for 20 minutes.
[10861.73s -> 10862.23s]  Roger.
[10864.40s -> 10865.68s]  Yo, guys.
[10865.68s -> 10867.36s]  They heard it was an emergency so they're like,
[10870.10s -> 10872.18s]  they're gonna come and be new pirates.
[10872.82s -> 10874.98s]  You invited the new antagonist to come find us.
[10875.78s -> 10877.82s]  Why did I panic?
[10878.54s -> 10881.58s]  Because I tried the calm approach
[10881.66s -> 10883.74s]  and they didn't listen to me so then I decided to scream.
[10883.74s -> 10885.02s]  You need to get that radio working.
[10885.02s -> 10886.06s]  I think someone should wait here.
[10886.06s -> 10888.06s]  It's gonna be like a second gang of pirates.
[10888.06s -> 10889.26s]  I gotta be honest.
[10889.26s -> 10891.42s]  I don't think I'm gonna make it down there in my shape.
[10891.42s -> 10891.98s]  I'll go.
[10891.98s -> 10893.02s]  150 degrees.
[10893.02s -> 10893.82s]  What's wrong with him?
[10893.82s -> 10895.90s]  I should be the one to go.
[10895.90s -> 10898.22s]  He got punched in the face like three hours ago.
[10898.22s -> 10898.72s]  Come on.
[10899.66s -> 10901.74s]  Sounds like you're scared of someone stepping out of your shadow.
[10901.74s -> 10903.98s]  Scared of my idiot brother getting himself killed?
[10903.98s -> 10905.82s]  How about showing me some brotherly love?
[10909.76s -> 10910.24s]  All right.
[10910.24s -> 10912.00s]  Hey, if you're sure you're up for it,
[10912.64s -> 10913.60s]  I believe you got it, bro.
[10914.37s -> 10915.25s]  I'm coming, too.
[10915.25s -> 10915.97s]  Hey, wait.
[10915.97s -> 10917.41s]  No, don't send him.
[10917.41s -> 10918.45s]  No, my bodyguard.
[10918.45s -> 10919.41s]  I can take care of myself.
[10929.28s -> 10929.92s]  Whoa, whoa.
[10929.92s -> 10932.30s]  If Julia says she can handle it,
[10932.94s -> 10933.82s]  she can handle it.
[10935.06s -> 10935.78s]  Case closed.
[10936.50s -> 10937.14s]  Okay, Julia.
[10939.06s -> 10939.56s]  Wait.
[10941.14s -> 10941.94s]  That team's dead.
[10949.84s -> 10950.34s]  I can't.
[10961.44s -> 10962.64s]  The two worst people.
[10962.64s -> 10964.64s]  It's like Star Wars trash compactor.
[10964.64s -> 10965.14s]  Shoot.
[10965.78s -> 10967.14s]  That's so fucking funny.
[10968.42s -> 10971.70s]  Immediately, the two potential worst people do this.
[10971.70s -> 10972.98s]  You guys can handle it?
[10972.98s -> 10974.50s]  The two weaklings.
[10974.50s -> 10975.94s]  We're like, can I go, please, mommy?
[10975.94s -> 10976.74s]  You doing okay?
[10976.74s -> 10977.22s]  Yeah, sure.
[10977.22s -> 10978.34s]  If you think you can handle it.
[10980.66s -> 10981.38s]  Immediately.
[10981.38s -> 10981.88s]  We're okay.
[10982.90s -> 10987.41s]  What are we going to do?
[10987.41s -> 10991.65s]  It's going to be a miracle if we can actually have everybody live.
[10991.65s -> 10992.21s]  We've got to find out where we are.
[10992.21s -> 10993.89s]  Okay.
[10993.89s -> 10995.33s]  We'll wait here by the radio.
[10995.33s -> 10997.41s]  Oh, I didn't realize that I have to be these two.
[10998.05s -> 10998.55s]  Here.
[10999.30s -> 11001.78s]  Dude, this is just the broken clock is right twice a day.
[11001.78s -> 11003.38s]  Somehow we ended up saving all five.
[11005.16s -> 11005.96s]  It ain't over yet.
[11006.60s -> 11009.56s]  There's going to be a spectacular like death parade at the end.
[11009.56s -> 11010.06s]  Hey.
[11014.63s -> 11015.27s]  With clowns.
[11015.91s -> 11018.57s]  After you.
[11019.27s -> 11021.67s]  Okay, here we go.
[11021.67s -> 11022.23s]  Is this us?
[11023.43s -> 11023.93s]  Yeah.
[11024.31s -> 11024.81s]  I'm Brad.
[11025.43s -> 11025.99s]  Are you?
[11025.99s -> 11026.95s]  Hey, am I though?
[11028.07s -> 11028.63s]  Might not be.
[11030.88s -> 11032.69s]  Guessing these are the lower level.
[11032.69s -> 11033.97s]  No, I'm just fucking around.
[11033.97s -> 11034.69s]  I'm actually upstairs.
[11036.29s -> 11036.79s]  No, you're not.
[11037.41s -> 11038.45s]  Yes, I am.
[11038.45s -> 11042.77s]  Don't lie to me.
[11042.77s -> 11043.41s]  I'm upstairs.
[11043.41s -> 11045.01s]  We were trying to get the radio to work again.
[11053.20s -> 11054.56s]  The frequencies are so stupid.
[11055.20s -> 11078.93s]  We should probably mute you.
[11078.93s -> 11082.87s]  I wish I could actually, you know, enjoy this.
[11082.87s -> 11084.71s]  What the hell are you talking about?
[11084.71s -> 11085.75s]  I think I think he thinks.
[11086.39s -> 11090.95s]  In any other circumstance, you know, this place would be the coolest place to explore.
[11090.95s -> 11092.07s]  Like, like ever.
[11092.07s -> 11093.67s]  I'm going to say no, not at all.
[11093.67s -> 11096.08s]  Says the girl on the way to die of a wreck.
[11096.96s -> 11098.32s]  Well, he's muted right now.
[11098.32s -> 11100.24s]  I think he think he muted first, not me.
[11104.66s -> 11105.94s]  He muted first.
[11105.94s -> 11114.47s]  I have to be a really, really good NPC here.
[11147.62s -> 11165.41s]  Wait, are you reverse pranking me right now?
[11165.41s -> 11166.37s]  I'm just curious.
[11166.37s -> 11170.18s]  How so?
[11171.20s -> 11175.88s]  Are you like reverse pranking me?
[11175.88s -> 11176.38s]  Reverse?
[11177.60s -> 11178.10s]  Yes.
[11178.40s -> 11180.56s]  You're up there doing the radio stuff, right?
[11181.12s -> 11184.69s]  Yeah, what are you doing down here?
[11184.69s -> 11185.17s]  Down here?
[11186.05s -> 11186.93s]  There's three different groups.
[11188.72s -> 11189.92s]  Oh shit, I blew it.
[11189.92s -> 11191.28s]  What are you doing down here?
[11194.77s -> 11198.92s]  Oh shit.
[11198.92s -> 11200.50s]  Oh, I knew from the beginning.
[11200.50s -> 11201.22s]  Oh, he knew.
[11201.22s -> 11201.86s]  He doesn't know.
[11202.34s -> 11208.40s]  All right, so what the hell are we supposed to be doing here?
[11211.43s -> 11212.87s]  Are you reverse pranking?
[11213.51s -> 11217.27s]  Would you think I was an NPC for a second just because I was holding the light?
[11217.27s -> 11218.23s]  Ten days in the brick.
[11218.23s -> 11221.67s]  No, I thought that you were pretending to be an NPC too.
[11221.67s -> 11224.23s]  And then I was going to freak out and be like, wait, is he actually down here?
[11224.87s -> 11226.48s]  Pretty good, pretty good attempt.
[11227.04s -> 11227.76s]  Ten days approved.
[11227.76s -> 11228.24s]  All right, let's see.
[11228.96s -> 11231.96s]  Engaging with the soldier in a drunken argument.
[11243.01s -> 11244.77s]  Every one of these hallways looks exactly the same.
[11245.49s -> 11256.42s]  The amount of times that I have Warcraft keyboard turned down a hallway
[11257.22s -> 11259.70s]  is probably like two hours of this game so far.
[11260.34s -> 11273.04s]  Now, where did you go?
[11273.68s -> 11279.60s]  Here, come check this out.
[11279.60s -> 11280.32s]  I just pulled him.
[11281.76s -> 11282.48s]  I got yoinked.
[11283.84s -> 11284.72s]  I just yoinked him.
[11285.36s -> 11287.80s]  Looks like the engine room.
[11287.80s -> 11289.32s]  Good place to find the generator, right?
[11289.96s -> 11296.31s]  Are you breath?
[11296.31s -> 11297.35s]  The ladder's broken off here.
[11299.40s -> 11301.16s]  I think I can just wait.
[11302.76s -> 11304.20s]  Oh, that would hurt so bad.
[11305.16s -> 11308.39s]  Yeah, just come down.
[11308.39s -> 11309.83s]  That's a back problem for the rest of your life.
[11310.47s -> 11313.94s]  You should have seen what happened to him earlier.
[11314.98s -> 11317.11s]  This is hurting me, just watching it.
[11317.11s -> 11318.79s]  He's fallen three times.
[11318.79s -> 11321.92s]  And what's the other guy's name?
[11321.92s -> 11322.56s]  Oh, God.
[11322.56s -> 11323.04s]  What's up?
[11323.04s -> 11324.96s]  That, it was, it was, it was.
[11324.96s -> 11326.48s]  Oh, not this shit again.
[11326.48s -> 11327.04s]  Did you see it?
[11328.64s -> 11329.28s]  Hello?
[11329.28s -> 11330.72s]  Isn't this just the same trick?
[11330.72s -> 11332.40s]  This is the same thing.
[11332.40s -> 11333.44s]  You're not.
[11333.44s -> 11334.40s]  It's the same thing.
[11334.96s -> 11336.08s]  Follow my thinking here.
[11336.08s -> 11338.64s]  We know this ship was carrying manchurian gold,
[11338.64s -> 11341.60s]  which was actually some kind of dangerous chemical, right?
[11341.60s -> 11343.92s]  And there's just like weird fog everywhere.
[11344.24s -> 11345.76s]  This is not a 12-hour game.
[11345.76s -> 11347.68s]  This happened twice in the last three hours.
[11347.68s -> 11347.92s]  Yeah.
[11347.92s -> 11350.64s]  Maybe it's fucking us all up, like in the head, you know?
[11350.64s -> 11353.28s]  I mean, I definitely saw some crazy shit
[11353.28s -> 11356.32s]  that I could have sworn was real, but maybe it wasn't.
[11356.32s -> 11358.56s]  We know the crew were scared shitless of something.
[11358.56s -> 11359.28s]  None of it happened.
[11359.92s -> 11361.28s]  None of it was real.
[11361.28s -> 11363.52s]  It was just a hallucination.
[11364.08s -> 11367.03s]  This couldn't have anything to do with the plane wreck we dived.
[11368.15s -> 11369.83s]  I mean, maybe there was a connection.
[11370.87s -> 11371.99s]  Maybe they made contact.
[11372.95s -> 11374.15s]  It's a theory, I guess.
[11374.95s -> 11375.83s]  Oh, God.
[11375.83s -> 11377.91s]  The thing we sent the guy with glasses down here,
[11377.91s -> 11379.27s]  we never would have figured this out.
[11379.27s -> 11379.67s]  Yeah, I know.
[11380.79s -> 11389.46s]  All right.
[11389.46s -> 11390.02s]  What does this say?
[11392.60s -> 11393.16s]  Netherlands.
[11395.00s -> 11399.64s]  Diesel engine number 1734, year 1920, type L87CSE.
[11400.36s -> 11402.28s]  Okay, cool.
[11403.16s -> 11418.26s]  I can't believe we are absolutely encroaching
[11418.26s -> 11420.10s]  on like the last arc of the game.
[11420.82s -> 11422.16s]  We have to be, right?
[11422.16s -> 11423.84s]  This is only like a four to five-hour game, right?
[11424.40s -> 11426.87s]  Uh-huh.
[11426.87s -> 11427.75s]  And they've already figured out
[11427.75s -> 11429.27s]  they just talked about the trick.
[11429.27s -> 11429.59s]  Yeah.
[11429.59s -> 11431.11s]  They just, there's gotta be like,
[11431.11s -> 11432.47s]  there's gotta be a gotcha moment
[11432.47s -> 11433.75s]  where you thought you had it figured out.
[11433.75s -> 11440.66s]  But then, hold on.
[11440.66s -> 11442.31s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[11442.87s -> 11450.82s]  Should I pull this out?
[11452.50s -> 11453.62s]  Hey, hey, I found it.
[11453.62s -> 11454.42s]  I think I just told them.
[11454.42s -> 11455.78s]  Stop finding all this stuff.
[11455.78s -> 11456.50s]  And it's working.
[11458.04s -> 11459.48s]  I'm trying to find stuff, too.
[11459.48s -> 11460.52s]  Yeah, this is it, all right.
[11460.52s -> 11461.16s]  But over there.
[11461.16s -> 11463.00s]  Just throw the switch and let's get back upstairs.
[11465.49s -> 11466.85s]  That's so ridiculous.
[11466.85s -> 11467.89s]  You're over there exploring
[11467.89s -> 11469.65s]  and whoever just finds the thing first
[11470.61s -> 11471.97s]  just sucks the person over.
[11473.75s -> 11476.64s]  Oh, wow.
[11476.64s -> 11477.20s]  What?
[11477.20s -> 11477.78s]  What do you mean?
[11477.78s -> 11478.34s]  What's the hold up?
[11478.34s -> 11480.34s]  You failed the QTE, so they let me do it.
[11480.34s -> 11481.22s]  I just did it.
[11484.88s -> 11486.40s]  That's why you had to call me over
[11486.40s -> 11488.24s]  because, you know, you're very book smart.
[11488.24s -> 11490.96s]  But when it comes to practically using your hands,
[11491.52s -> 11492.16s]  you need some help.
[11496.79s -> 11497.35s]  I did it.
[11497.35s -> 11498.79s]  And then you stepped in and did it again.
[11499.35s -> 11500.39s]  Mom, it's my turn.
[11500.39s -> 11501.67s]  I'm super Nintendo.
[11501.67s -> 11504.07s]  There are things on the ship that are trying to hurt us.
[11504.07s -> 11504.57s]  Over.
[11510.80s -> 11511.52s]  It's not real.
[11511.92s -> 11513.76s]  We think the name of it is the Iran Medan.
[11515.09s -> 11515.41s]  Really?
[11515.41s -> 11516.29s]  The Iran Medan?
[11517.09s -> 11518.21s]  Why was there no subtitles there?
[11519.09s -> 11529.24s]  What did he say?
[11529.24s -> 11530.20s]  The Iran Medan?
[11531.64s -> 11532.84s]  The Duran Duran?
[11532.84s -> 11533.88s]  What was the name of the boat?
[11533.88s -> 11535.00s]  What was what's this called?
[11535.00s -> 11535.72s]  Iran Medan.
[11537.08s -> 11547.80s]  Look at this.
[11547.80s -> 11550.52s]  Hey, come on over.
[11550.52s -> 11554.40s]  The fisherman must have bothered over from the Duke of Milan.
[11554.96s -> 11556.48s]  You think it still works?
[11556.48s -> 11558.16s]  Looks like it's got a little juice left.
[11558.16s -> 11559.04s]  Maybe a couple of minutes.
[11559.68s -> 11560.56s]  Should we bring it with us?
[11560.56s -> 11561.28s]  I mean, it's heavy.
[11562.00s -> 11564.28s]  What is it?
[11564.36s -> 11564.68s]  Hang on.
[11564.68s -> 11565.24s]  No, seriously.
[11565.24s -> 11565.96s]  What is it?
[11565.96s -> 11569.88s]  Uh, it's the Ghostbusters proton pack thing to dive with.
[11571.17s -> 11572.53s]  Scuba gear stuff.
[11581.44s -> 11582.48s]  Those guys aren't even real.
[11588.16s -> 11592.98s]  Actually, they have to be because we have a shared hallucination yet.
[11595.99s -> 11596.63s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[11606.05s -> 11606.77s]  He can't hear you.
[11606.77s -> 11608.37s]  He's not awake.
[11609.33s -> 11612.64s]  Yeah, but he's hallucinating.
[11614.64s -> 11615.68s]  He's hallucinating.
[11629.70s -> 11631.94s]  Rip right side, look right into the camera because he sees us.
[11640.26s -> 11643.54s]  So have we not concluded that the hallucinations are a result of this
[11643.54s -> 11647.06s]  strange miasmic gas that has been pouring into the boat since we got on it?
[11647.06s -> 11648.34s]  I mean, yeah, that's what it is.
[11654.61s -> 11658.63s]  Oh, oh, oh, he can hear heartbeats.
[11659.75s -> 11670.39s]  How do you not turn around?
[11671.51s -> 11675.44s]  All right, all your Super Mario RPG practice should have prepared you for that.
[11677.28s -> 11684.88s]  Oh, he's going to get up.
[11685.44s -> 11686.40s]  Don't breathe in the gas.
[11686.40s -> 11686.96s]  Hold your breath.
[11687.94s -> 11689.30s]  Hold your breath.
[11689.86s -> 11694.74s]  Wait, am I?
[11696.66s -> 11698.82s]  I'm like seeing that's not there.
[11702.18s -> 11703.62s]  Yeah, here comes hallucination.
[11715.67s -> 11715.99s]  I know.
[11716.63s -> 11717.35s]  No, we don't.
[11721.16s -> 11722.68s]  Are we going to do a mute scenario?
[11723.89s -> 11724.77s]  Incoming mute.
[11727.75s -> 11730.31s]  What did you pick?
[11730.31s -> 11730.63s]  Nothing.
[11730.63s -> 11731.35s]  It was you.
[11731.35s -> 11731.75s]  You was on.
[11731.75s -> 11732.39s]  That was your pick.
[11733.86s -> 11734.26s]  What did I?
[11735.06s -> 11737.01s]  What was important about his hand?
[11738.61s -> 11741.76s]  I don't know.
[11741.76s -> 11742.72s]  Maybe he had something in it.
[11743.28s -> 11745.88s]  We didn't get the cap.
[11745.88s -> 11746.68s]  Did we get the cap?
[11746.68s -> 11747.40s]  No, he has it.
[11757.48s -> 11758.84s]  Is this the same voice actor?
[11761.38s -> 11762.58s]  Maybe they changed to...
[11763.78s -> 11765.41s]  Did they Dario this guy?
[11766.69s -> 11768.90s]  Again?
[11768.90s -> 11770.58s]  Again, the comm meter.
[11785.38s -> 11787.06s]  He set the title of my stream.
[11787.06s -> 11788.74s]  He said the title of my stream.
[11788.74s -> 11789.22s]  I'm sorry.
[11794.18s -> 11794.90s]  I did not know that.
[11794.90s -> 11796.26s]  He said the title of my fucking stream.
[11796.26s -> 11796.98s]  That freaked me out.
[11796.98s -> 11797.38s]  I'm sorry.
[11809.27s -> 11811.35s]  That's the title of my fucking live stream.
[11839.25s -> 11840.85s]  I got so hyped up over that.
[11842.21s -> 11843.89s]  Didn't this guy get drowned earlier?
[11845.17s -> 11845.73s]  I don't know.
[11845.73s -> 11845.97s]  What?
[11846.69s -> 11847.97s]  Okay.
[11847.97s -> 11850.56s]  How many pirates are there?
[11850.56s -> 11851.68s]  What do you mean drowned twice?
[11858.44s -> 11860.04s]  I may as well have got up from the seat
[11860.04s -> 11861.24s]  and like spun around walking.
[11861.24s -> 11862.68s]  He said the title of my stream.
[11867.09s -> 11867.73s]  Please.
[11867.73s -> 11869.57s]  We've got no problem with you.
[11869.57s -> 11870.85s]  We just want to get out of here.
[11871.97s -> 11872.37s]  Please.
[11873.49s -> 11874.37s]  I'm sorry.
[11874.37s -> 11875.81s]  But if you're breathing,
[11876.37s -> 11878.61s]  then you don't get much of a choice in the matter.
[11878.85s -> 11880.37s]  Oh, they're taking my choice away.
[11883.81s -> 11884.77s]  Not again.
[11884.77s -> 11886.74s]  I'm changing on me.
[11886.74s -> 11888.07s]  What?
[11888.07s -> 11888.87s]  What's changing?
[11889.51s -> 11890.07s]  Stay away.
[11891.33s -> 11892.45s]  Stay back from the mist.
[11893.17s -> 11893.41s]  What?
[11894.05s -> 11895.01s]  There's no mist, man.
[11895.81s -> 11896.45s]  Don't breathe it.
[11896.45s -> 11897.49s]  There's the guy.
[11897.49s -> 11898.29s]  Don't breathe the mist.
[11898.29s -> 11898.77s]  The guy.
[11900.05s -> 11900.69s]  Did you see him?
[11900.69s -> 11901.33s]  Don't breathe it.
[11902.21s -> 11903.40s]  What man?
[11904.52s -> 11909.35s]  The guy from the book's shelf was in the background.
[11909.35s -> 11910.31s]  Why can't we breathe the mist?
[11910.95s -> 11911.75s]  What does it do?
[11912.63s -> 11913.68s]  He was in the mist.
[11914.32s -> 11914.56s]  Life.
[11915.76s -> 11918.32s]  Bringing things to life that shouldn't be alive.
[11919.28s -> 11920.63s]  It's inside now.
[11921.97s -> 11923.49s]  Inside with us now.
[11924.69s -> 11926.21s]  Please just calm down.
[11926.21s -> 11926.53s]  Stop.
[11927.76s -> 11928.08s]  Stop.
[11928.96s -> 11931.62s]  It's in one of us, isn't it?
[11932.42s -> 11935.00s]  Got to have to tell him like he has the flashlight
[11935.00s -> 11936.04s]  and I have the gun so we have to trade.
[11936.68s -> 11938.63s]  You're holding a flashlight, man.
[11938.63s -> 11939.19s]  I'm holding the gun.
[11939.19s -> 11939.59s]  Let's trade.
[11939.59s -> 11940.87s]  Put the gun down.
[11940.87s -> 11941.43s]  Now.
[11941.43s -> 11942.87s]  I wish you said it.
[11944.39s -> 11945.59s]  Why are you telling me what to do?
[11946.15s -> 11947.43s]  Yeah, you were in the mist.
[11948.23s -> 11948.95s]  It's happening.
[11950.66s -> 11951.70s]  Well, I guess we're dead.
[11953.46s -> 11953.78s]  Wait.
[11958.47s -> 11959.51s]  Hey, all right.
[11959.51s -> 11961.83s]  Look, there was something back there.
[11962.47s -> 11963.75s]  Maybe a mist or fog.
[11963.75s -> 11964.07s]  Maybe.
[11965.35s -> 11969.51s]  Did you just admit to breathing the mist?
[11969.51s -> 11970.79s]  That's the guy with the gun.
[11975.06s -> 11977.38s]  No, look, we held our breath.
[11977.38s -> 11979.06s]  We did not breathe any of that stuff.
[11979.06s -> 11985.49s]  Oh, fancy divers.
[11985.49s -> 11987.01s]  But you expect me to buy that?
[11988.69s -> 11990.76s]  We've been for hours.
[11990.76s -> 11992.60s]  That's actually a great argument with divers.
[11992.60s -> 11993.56s]  You've been holding your breath this whole time.
[11994.52s -> 11995.80s]  You're holding your breath right now.
[11995.80s -> 12001.86s]  The mist in me don't die.
[12001.86s -> 12002.18s]  See?
[12002.18s -> 12002.90s]  I freaked him out.
[12004.26s -> 12004.98s]  I freaked him out.
[12006.53s -> 12007.81s]  So I got some bad news for you.
[12007.81s -> 12018.31s]  I can feel it swirling around gently inside.
[12018.31s -> 12018.81s]  Wait, what?
[12020.00s -> 12020.96s]  Wait, what if that's one of us?
[12020.96s -> 12023.04s]  And what if we breathe the mist and that's one of us?
[12023.04s -> 12024.16s]  No, let him do it.
[12024.16s -> 12024.80s]  What are you talking about?
[12025.28s -> 12026.00s]  Just let him do it.
[12026.64s -> 12027.68s]  I wouldn't even let him do it.
[12028.24s -> 12028.80s]  There is no...
[12028.80s -> 12031.14s]  No, no, I can't see it.
[12031.14s -> 12031.62s]  You're all right.
[12031.62s -> 12032.84s]  There's no mist.
[12033.48s -> 12036.23s]  Stop lying.
[12036.23s -> 12041.28s]  I don't see it in me, can't you?
[12041.28s -> 12043.94s]  You're all just lying.
[12044.58s -> 12046.10s]  The mist is inside.
[12046.66s -> 12054.63s]  Where's the flashlight?
[12054.63s -> 12055.83s]  The flashlight was hovering.
[12056.55s -> 12057.59s]  Hey, man, come on.
[12057.59s -> 12057.99s]  Just put...
[12059.27s -> 12062.07s]  All right, now the premonition has been fulfilled.
[12062.63s -> 12063.83s]  Fucking shit.
[12063.83s -> 12064.39s]  We're fine.
[12065.19s -> 12067.19s]  I saw him kill himself like an hour ago.
[12067.19s -> 12068.07s]  You did?
[12068.07s -> 12068.79s]  In a premonition.
[12068.79s -> 12069.27s]  But where...
[12070.07s -> 12079.46s]  I honestly don't know if there was another outcome for that because
[12083.91s -> 12085.99s]  he's been dead for centuries.
[12087.03s -> 12089.08s]  Hey, we got a gun.
[12089.72s -> 12092.76s]  No, we don't because this is two people that don't want guns.
[12092.76s -> 12093.48s]  Oh.
[12093.48s -> 12094.28s]  So we threw it back.
[12094.92s -> 12095.56s]  Well, so what?
[12100.04s -> 12102.76s]  Maybe if you sent down the wrong two people, he would have killed them.
[12103.64s -> 12106.04s]  We sent the two least threatening people in the crew.
[12106.60s -> 12107.32s]  I don't know.
[12107.32s -> 12111.48s]  Wait by the radio.
[12111.48s -> 12112.04s]  Why?
[12112.04s -> 12113.56s]  I'm going to check the next level.
[12113.56s -> 12115.40s]  There might be some more gear down there we can use.
[12115.40s -> 12115.96s]  Uh...
[12116.04s -> 12118.96s]  Just wait by the radio.
[12119.68s -> 12121.46s]  I'm going to hang back here as well.
[12123.59s -> 12124.87s]  See, I thought they were pulling like a...
[12125.67s -> 12127.75s]  You breathe the mist and like was that one of us?
[12127.75s -> 12129.83s]  And like he was back at the wall with the flashlight.
[12130.47s -> 12130.87s]  Nobody's good.
[12130.87s -> 12133.03s]  I don't think we can because there's no...
[12133.03s -> 12135.99s]  The only times we've hallucinated, we've been by ourselves.
[12135.99s -> 12137.27s]  Like Alex right here.
[12137.91s -> 12140.07s]  So Alex is going to be hallucinating.
[12140.07s -> 12142.87s]  Why can't people fucking just slowly go down a hole?
[12143.91s -> 12145.56s]  Don't say the name of my stream again.
[12145.56s -> 12146.20s]  He's invisible.
[12147.08s -> 12147.96s]  He's invisible.
[12149.54s -> 12150.74s]  How did he not see that?
[12151.06s -> 12152.58s]  He's like a splinter cell enemy.
[12167.81s -> 12168.61s]  Oh, he's left eye.
[12168.61s -> 12169.09s]  He's blind.
[12169.09s -> 12170.77s]  He just didn't turn left at all.
[12182.56s -> 12183.44s]  Who's in the background?
[12184.26s -> 12185.38s]  The guy that's watching us.
[12186.74s -> 12189.99s]  All right.
[12189.99s -> 12190.71s]  Um, so you're...
[12191.51s -> 12192.23s]  I am Alex.
[12192.23s -> 12193.43s]  You are Phyllis, right?
[12194.63s -> 12196.44s]  I'm down there with Julia.
[12197.64s -> 12198.12s]  So you're in...
[12198.12s -> 12199.00s]  Wait, you're not Phyllis.
[12199.88s -> 12202.45s]  It's Phyllis, the captain?
[12202.45s -> 12202.69s]  Yes.
[12210.13s -> 12210.45s]  All right.
[12210.45s -> 12213.09s]  I am breathing mist in my own fucking room here.
[12213.09s -> 12213.97s]  What's happening?
[12213.97s -> 12214.45s]  Who are you?
[12215.17s -> 12217.62s]  I'm breathing mist into my own fucking office.
[12217.62s -> 12218.50s]  You're breathing mist?
[12232.53s -> 12234.29s]  Is the mist coming in through the air conditioning?
[12238.87s -> 12239.51s]  In the office?
[12248.10s -> 12249.14s]  It's vape juice.
[12258.37s -> 12259.17s]  Vape juice.
[12259.97s -> 12260.45s]  Uh-oh.
[12260.45s -> 12261.09s]  There he is.
[12270.60s -> 12271.80s]  The sledgehammer, boss.
[12278.12s -> 12278.60s]  Oh, no.
[12279.56s -> 12280.44s]  Oh, my God.
[12280.44s -> 12282.36s]  I was looking at my fucking phone.
[12282.36s -> 12284.04s]  Oh, why was I doing that?
[12284.04s -> 12284.76s]  That was stupid.
[12285.80s -> 12286.12s]  I'm fine.
[12286.12s -> 12286.52s]  It's okay.
[12286.52s -> 12287.64s]  You weren't meant to die there.
[12289.94s -> 12290.66s]  Holy fuck.
[12290.66s -> 12292.10s]  I looked at my phone again.
[12293.83s -> 12294.55s]  Holy shit.
[12304.32s -> 12305.04s]  More mist.
[12305.60s -> 12313.70s]  So when you said that they were transporting drugs earlier,
[12313.70s -> 12314.66s]  you might have been right.
[12315.46s -> 12316.71s]  Was I right?
[12316.71s -> 12317.43s]  The mist drug.
[12318.15s -> 12328.00s]  That's going to be revealed to be some kind of crazy advanced biochemical warfare.
[12328.00s -> 12329.76s]  That's the allies we're going to use.
[12330.48s -> 12333.20s]  The mist just came out of it.
[12333.20s -> 12337.60s]  The 1940s American military was going to use these weapons of biochemical war.
[12338.40s -> 12353.57s]  Where'd you?
[12354.13s -> 12356.66s]  All right.
[12356.66s -> 12357.14s]  We have to mute.
[12358.02s -> 12358.42s]  Mute.
[12358.42s -> 12358.74s]  Mute.
[12359.38s -> 12367.44s]  What the fuck?
[12368.08s -> 12379.36s]  Is that me?
[12379.36s -> 12400.88s]  Oh, this is the laundry room.
[12409.17s -> 12409.65s]  Dead guy.
[12410.37s -> 12417.30s]  Of course.
[12418.02s -> 12420.60s]  They will restrict you a moment around the plants
[12420.60s -> 12422.12s]  to prove difficult to look for Jones.
[12422.20s -> 12423.40s]  Your primary objective is clear,
[12423.40s -> 12425.32s]  but your secondary objective is when you reach your destination
[12425.32s -> 12428.52s]  is to locate Jones and his men and get them back on home.
[12428.52s -> 12429.32s]  I'm going to sit online.
[12429.88s -> 12432.68s]  You must be vigilant and be very concerned with your personal safety.
[12434.05s -> 12435.25s]  You got another one.
[12435.25s -> 12435.57s]  Okay.
[12436.37s -> 12439.67s]  They've been captured.
[12439.67s -> 12440.31s]  They're still alive.
[12440.31s -> 12443.43s]  Only that their last notification was approaching the plant and they were silent.
[12443.43s -> 12444.47s]  The plant is high security.
[12444.47s -> 12445.19s]  They're expecting you.
[12446.15s -> 12448.53s]  Sergeant Jones and five of his platoon have been missing
[12448.53s -> 12450.93s]  during a reconnaissance mission at the water purification plant.
[12451.49s -> 12453.01s]  Water purification plant.
[12453.97s -> 12456.52s]  So they're putting something in the water.
[12457.32s -> 12461.01s]  The mist was supposed to the best is that I get it.
[12475.25s -> 12476.37s]  I don't think he gets it.
[12477.01s -> 12477.57s]  Now I get it.
[12478.13s -> 12489.24s]  The thing is, where did the talics go?
[12489.80s -> 12496.08s]  Nothing else over here.
[12496.72s -> 12501.17s]  And we can't go back.
[12501.17s -> 12501.97s]  I can't go back that way.
[12508.29s -> 12509.73s]  Explain the whole plot to me.
[12509.73s -> 12509.97s]  Okay.
[12513.94s -> 12514.66s]  What the fuck?
[12514.66s -> 12515.62s]  Who are you?
[12515.62s -> 12529.59s]  That's what the hell I'm supposed to do.
[12529.59s -> 12538.16s]  Is there a hallway I can go down?
[12546.56s -> 12546.80s]  Yeah.
[12546.80s -> 12548.32s]  I'm like, how am I lost?
[12549.12s -> 12550.00s]  This is like the only.
[12550.88s -> 12552.16s]  I can't let go.
[12552.16s -> 12552.66s]  Fliss.
[12553.60s -> 12554.00s]  You okay?
[12560.39s -> 12565.17s]  I'm in different clothes.
[12566.05s -> 12567.80s]  What the fuck is going on?
[12570.68s -> 12584.95s]  What the hell happened?
[12588.87s -> 12590.15s]  The rats are going to get me.
[12591.03s -> 12594.58s]  They're not real.
[12594.58s -> 12595.54s]  The rats aren't real.
[12595.54s -> 12596.04s]  Let's get out.
[12599.62s -> 12600.90s]  What the fuck is going on?
[12602.10s -> 12602.82s]  Is that a talics?
[12603.54s -> 12610.98s]  Should I have said that?
[12624.76s -> 12626.16s]  I don't die.
[12626.16s -> 12627.12s]  I can't communicate.
[12628.00s -> 12629.51s]  I can't communicate.
[12630.47s -> 12633.75s]  What did you do to me?
[12635.68s -> 12636.40s]  What did you do to me?
[12638.00s -> 12638.96s]  What the fuck?
[12641.12s -> 12641.76s]  Why did.
[12642.80s -> 12644.55s]  Who's doing that?
[12653.52s -> 12654.72s]  Why did that happen to me?
[12657.00s -> 12657.80s]  What?
[12657.80s -> 12658.44s]  Kill the rat.
[12660.42s -> 12660.90s]  Should I?
[12660.90s -> 12662.42s]  No, the rat's not real.
[12662.42s -> 12663.14s]  The rat's not real.
[12663.14s -> 12663.62s]  Don't do that.
[12664.58s -> 12680.66s]  Well, I would have stabbed him and killed him.
[12681.46s -> 12682.82s]  If I had stabbed the monster,
[12682.82s -> 12684.98s]  I would have killed like somebody else.
[12685.54s -> 12694.36s]  Are you Brad?
[12697.46s -> 12698.18s]  I am now.
[12713.99s -> 12714.63s]  You hungry?
[12717.11s -> 12718.07s]  I heard some like,
[12718.07s -> 12718.87s]  stomach noises.
[12719.51s -> 12721.36s]  I just wonder if you need a snack.
[12726.05s -> 12727.33s]  I didn't want to stab.
[12727.33s -> 12727.81s]  That was.
[12727.81s -> 12729.17s]  I didn't want to stab you.
[12730.05s -> 12733.65s]  So I'm like, oh, I'll get the monster in my.
[12733.65s -> 12734.15s]  Let me see.
[12734.69s -> 12735.49s]  Duke of Milan?
[12735.57s -> 12736.13s]  No engine.
[12736.69s -> 12737.97s]  Yes, that's pretty much the end of it.
[12738.69s -> 12739.33s]  Looks like it.
[12740.13s -> 12741.33s]  You know, I was hoping to die.
[12742.93s -> 12743.89s]  I could have done nothing.
[12752.58s -> 12753.70s]  Yeah, but whatever.
[12753.70s -> 12756.34s]  I, I we've been going out.
[12756.34s -> 12757.86s]  So you got scared on my screen.
[12757.86s -> 12759.30s]  You were running away from a rat.
[12759.94s -> 12760.26s]  Yes.
[12760.26s -> 12763.06s]  And on my screen, the rat busted through my chest
[12763.06s -> 12763.86s]  and was killing me.
[12764.66s -> 12766.98s]  And I had a choice to stab the monster,
[12766.98s -> 12768.42s]  which was you probably,
[12768.42s -> 12769.94s]  or the rat in my stomach.
[12769.94s -> 12771.78s]  And I realized, wait, the rat's not real.
[12771.78s -> 12773.22s]  I just, I killed myself.
[12774.58s -> 12775.70s]  Rat in my stomach.
[12775.70s -> 12777.30s]  He was everything I ever wanted to be, you know?
[12778.42s -> 12780.26s]  I just wanted to be able to tell him.
[12780.26s -> 12780.82s]  I'm sorry.
[12782.26s -> 12785.04s]  And now I'll never get that chance.
[12785.04s -> 12786.82s]  He's fucking dead.
[12787.62s -> 12791.20s]  God, I'm so sorry.
[12791.20s -> 12792.56s]  Wait, that's not the end of the game.
[12792.56s -> 12793.44s]  I'm so sorry.
[12797.64s -> 12800.76s]  You killed the person with arguably the most personal connection
[12800.76s -> 12802.36s]  to any of these characters.
[12802.36s -> 12807.48s]  Nobody would care if Chad died.
[12807.48s -> 12808.04s]  What's his name?
[12809.73s -> 12810.13s]  Drew.
[12810.13s -> 12810.77s]  Wait, hold on.
[12810.77s -> 12811.97s]  That's the end of the game.
[12817.09s -> 12817.57s]  No, it's not.
[12820.21s -> 12820.77s]  Conrad.
[12827.80s -> 12828.92s]  That's the end.
[12830.88s -> 12831.92s]  I guess that's the end.
[12831.92s -> 12834.00s]  That's how you make core games nowadays.
[12835.41s -> 12838.45s]  By the way, on my screen, there was a piece of paper
[12838.45s -> 12840.93s]  that confirmed my theory that it was a military weapon
[12841.57s -> 12842.53s]  when roped.
[12842.53s -> 12843.97s]  So literally the next scene.
[12845.03s -> 12845.99s]  That's it.
[12845.99s -> 12847.03s]  Game over.
[12847.03s -> 12848.15s]  You're dumb.
[12848.15s -> 12848.71s]  You're dumb?
[12849.59s -> 12850.79s]  Oh, I thought he said I'm dumb.
[12850.79s -> 12851.75s]  I was supposed to say fuck you.
[12851.75s -> 12854.23s]  You can't do better next time around.
[12854.23s -> 12857.16s]  Impressive.
[12858.04s -> 12859.64s]  Almost everyone survived.
[12860.66s -> 12862.10s]  The last fucking cutesy.
[12862.10s -> 12863.14s]  Oh, god damn it.
[12863.14s -> 12863.46s]  Really?
[12864.96s -> 12866.56s]  And the distributor cap?
[12867.89s -> 12869.94s]  Boom.
[12869.94s -> 12870.50s]  All right, yeah.
[12871.54s -> 12874.10s]  Apparently, I broke that, but it wasn't my fault.
[12874.10s -> 12874.74s]  It's all about...
[12874.74s -> 12875.70s]  Wait, hold on.
[12875.70s -> 12877.78s]  Give me some credit here.
[12877.78s -> 12878.98s]  My game broke.
[12878.98s -> 12880.98s]  I teleported into a room
[12880.98s -> 12883.86s]  and then the cutscene jumped around in three different rooms.
[12883.86s -> 12885.38s]  You got to give me some credit here.
[12885.38s -> 12886.18s]  That was bullshit.
[12886.74s -> 12888.66s]  I teleported into the laundry room.
[12889.86s -> 12890.50s]  But then...
[12890.50s -> 12892.34s]  And then my character changed clothes.
[12896.13s -> 12898.05s]  And then a guy was being eaten by rats
[12898.05s -> 12900.05s]  and then I got a knife and I had to stab myself.
[12901.32s -> 12902.68s]  You got to see what happened to me
[12903.48s -> 12904.68s]  when you were the monster
[12904.68s -> 12907.32s]  because it had to have been more abrupt.
[12907.32s -> 12908.44s]  Till we meet again,
[12909.16s -> 12910.68s]  maybe in Little Hope,
[12910.68s -> 12912.12s]  maybe somewhere else.
[12913.88s -> 12914.84s]  But be certain,
[12915.64s -> 12916.76s]  we will meet again.
[12917.80s -> 12920.20s]  It's inevitable.
[12925.44s -> 12927.28s]  Regardless of how many people survived,
[12927.28s -> 12930.96s]  that is somehow worse than the Blair Witch ending yesterday.
[12944.74s -> 12947.22s]  Restart and don't break the distributor cap.
[12947.22s -> 12949.70s]  You want us to go through the three hours and 40 minutes?
[12951.06s -> 12953.54s]  How is this only three and a half hours, by the way?
[12954.53s -> 12956.13s]  We were playing on streamer time, too.
[12956.13s -> 12957.09s]  Wait, hold on.
[12957.09s -> 12958.69s]  So how did you break the distributor cap?
[12959.25s -> 12959.65s]  I don't know.
[12959.65s -> 12961.65s]  There was a door and I tried to open it
[12961.65s -> 12964.61s]  and then I had to mash A and I successfully mashed A.
[12964.61s -> 12966.05s]  Then an elevator fell down
[12966.05s -> 12968.05s]  and then it broke the distributor cap that was down there.
[12973.73s -> 12975.41s]  I don't know how to even save that.
[12977.01s -> 12977.73s]  I can't skip it.
[12980.53s -> 12981.01s]  All right, let's...
[12981.01s -> 12982.37s]  You want to go back and try to save everybody?
[12984.47s -> 12986.15s]  Apparently, we can do a scene select.
[12986.95s -> 12988.15s]  Okay, let's do the scene select.
[12989.44s -> 12990.08s]  All right, hold on.
[12994.53s -> 12996.53s]  Elevator was Jerma's fault.
[12996.53s -> 12996.77s]  How?
[12997.49s -> 12998.13s]  Was it?
[12998.13s -> 12998.93s]  What did I do?
[12998.93s -> 13000.69s]  My character like teleported around
[13000.69s -> 13002.61s]  and then like I saw something break.
[13007.64s -> 13010.84s]  I'm like an innocent bystander for this whole game.
[13011.48s -> 13012.92s]  I don't think I chose one.
[13012.92s -> 13014.44s]  Oh, I did choose not to kill you.
[13014.44s -> 13018.20s]  I think I took too long getting to the elevator.
[13019.88s -> 13020.28s]  I don't know.
[13024.93s -> 13025.41s]  What is this?
[13027.04s -> 13028.48s]  Is this post credits?
[13028.48s -> 13028.72s]  Yeah.
[13030.82s -> 13031.78s]  They're going to kill everybody.
[13032.98s -> 13036.44s]  Protect the government secret.
[13055.56s -> 13057.64s]  So that whole thing was for fucking no reason?
[13059.38s -> 13060.42s]  Did I write this game?
[13062.05s -> 13062.85s]  Did I do this?
[13064.13s -> 13069.43s]  So even if all five got in, then it's all five go anyways.
[13070.56s -> 13072.24s]  Unless you protect the cap, apparently.
[13073.12s -> 13074.96s]  Oh, you got to get the cap.
[13074.96s -> 13076.40s]  Did you escape on the boat?
[13083.04s -> 13084.40s]  And then everyone died.
[13085.12s -> 13086.80s]  See, nothing that we did mattered.
[13086.80s -> 13089.44s]  No, like you can make it matter.
[13090.48s -> 13091.68s]  Oh, wait, is it preview?
[13094.92s -> 13095.72s]  I know that guy.
[13096.44s -> 13097.40s]  He's in a bunch of movies.
[13120.96s -> 13121.92s]  Little hope.
[13121.92s -> 13123.12s]  In 2020?
[13124.48s -> 13127.76s]  That seems like a very long time away for episode two.
[13128.56s -> 13130.72s]  Well, here's the bad news.
[13130.72s -> 13132.08s]  It's a separate purchase, I think.
[13132.72s -> 13133.12s]  Is this?
[13134.40s -> 13135.12s]  I think it is.
[13135.12s -> 13136.08s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13136.08s -> 13137.44s]  Jack can correct me if I'm wrong.
[13140.39s -> 13141.51s]  Wait, hold on.
[13141.51s -> 13144.45s]  Slow down and back that up and just reverse it for a second.
[13144.45s -> 13148.05s]  I'm pretty sure this is a standalone purchase that we just played.
[13148.05s -> 13151.81s]  This is a three hour and like 20 minute experience, essentially.
[13151.81s -> 13152.69s]  Uh-huh.
[13152.69s -> 13152.93s]  Yeah.
[13152.93s -> 13153.41s]  It's $40.
[13154.85s -> 13156.05s]  And then episode two.
[13156.05s -> 13156.61s]  How much was it?
[13156.61s -> 13157.57s]  Was it 30 or 40 bucks?
[13157.57s -> 13158.13s]  How much was this?
[13159.01s -> 13164.12s]  It wasn't 40, I don't think.
[13164.12s -> 13164.84s]  Is it 30?
[13164.84s -> 13165.64s]  All right, is there okay?
[13166.84s -> 13167.40s]  All right, all right.
[13168.36s -> 13169.32s]  That's apparently it's 30.
[13173.28s -> 13177.84s]  Yeah, and they didn't do the way out where only one person has to buy it
[13177.84s -> 13179.20s]  to like play with the other person.
[13179.92s -> 13180.88s]  So we both bought it.
[13180.88s -> 13184.32s]  That is technically one ending you can get, right?
[13184.88s -> 13188.71s]  So I mean, you could technically play through this game like a few times, right?
[13188.71s -> 13195.52s]  I think this would be worth it if you, at least I'm down, I'm at zero, so.
[13195.52s -> 13197.76s]  Wait, you get this game at zero?
[13197.76s -> 13200.24s]  No, no, no, like OBS is at zero.
[13201.12s -> 13203.22s]  Oh, but I hear you.
[13203.22s -> 13203.94s]  I'm still alive.
[13206.48s -> 13206.96s]  Anyway.
[13210.23s -> 13213.43s]  Okay, because that was like that transition was just like, you know, it'll be great.
[13213.43s -> 13216.23s]  I mean, I mean, I'm at a zero right now, essentially.
[13217.43s -> 13219.67s]  I don't know why I'm still at zero.
[13219.67s -> 13219.99s]  What?
[13220.87s -> 13222.87s]  Yeah, it must be VPN.
[13222.87s -> 13226.63s]  Maybe it's a VPN spoken up because I'm still fine.
[13227.43s -> 13229.44s]  Maybe it's, yeah, that's weird.
[13229.44s -> 13230.24s]  You should come back.
[13230.24s -> 13231.04s]  It's very soon here.
[13231.92s -> 13233.86s]  It's actually not Cox.
[13234.42s -> 13235.70s]  No, not Cox this time.
[13237.78s -> 13240.02s]  You want to try to do the last part again?
[13240.82s -> 13242.52s]  See what happens.
[13242.52s -> 13243.56s]  Yeah, I'll give it a try.
[13244.36s -> 13246.96s]  Let's do that final scene and see if we can do it.
[13247.60s -> 13251.08s]  I'm going to invite you.
[13261.24s -> 13261.96s]  Hold on.
[13262.60s -> 13265.00s]  So like, okay, if you do that.
[13265.00s -> 13266.60s]  Technical difficulties.
[13266.60s -> 13267.24s]  Yeah, do you think?
[13268.20s -> 13269.56s]  I'm just gonna hang up for a little bit.
[13269.56s -> 13278.74s]  So if you play this game alone, there goes kind of all the fun.
[13282.85s -> 13288.13s]  Yeah, I mean, whatever fun you have is absolutely not present.
[13288.93s -> 13289.97s]  Because, oh, is it?
[13289.97s -> 13295.25s]  I mean, once we figured it out that it was like, wait a minute, are you Brad?
[13295.25s -> 13296.29s]  Oh, hey, am I Brad?
[13297.36s -> 13298.08s]  Wait, who are you?
[13298.72s -> 13300.40s]  That was like, oh, that's kind of fun.
[13301.04s -> 13305.60s]  But if you do that by yourself, you don't get to ask your friend.
[13305.60s -> 13306.16s]  Are you Brad?
[13318.26s -> 13319.38s]  Mad because Brad.
[13320.18s -> 13330.34s]  $30 for are you Brad?
[13335.94s -> 13342.32s]  I mean, it seems like there's, I wish there was more there.
[13342.32s -> 13346.55s]  It felt like the first, I guess, can people like die on the boat?
[13346.55s -> 13348.87s]  I don't know how we didn't lose somebody on the boat.
[13348.87s -> 13352.23s]  How do I stab myself in the stomach at the very last QTE of the game?
[13353.38s -> 13357.62s]  And no one died during the hostage situation on the boat?
[13357.62s -> 13359.12s]  That makes no sense.
[13363.40s -> 13366.04s]  We like dropped the gun, dropped the knife, like dodged.
[13366.76s -> 13368.12s]  QTE fail, punched in the face.
[13368.12s -> 13369.48s]  How do you play this game in couch co-op?
[13370.20s -> 13370.60s]  I don't know.
[13370.60s -> 13372.44s]  I think you just all watch, I think you watch a movie.
[13374.21s -> 13376.53s]  Because wouldn't you know all the information that the other people know?
[13379.06s -> 13379.54s]  I guess.
[13380.90s -> 13385.54s]  So how would, where would the secret be if someone's the monster or not?
[13385.54s -> 13387.70s]  Maybe I guess they just don't control the monster.
[13388.66s -> 13390.55s]  It just cuts part of the scene.
[13390.55s -> 13391.19s]  Oh, I wonder.
[13392.68s -> 13394.60s]  Anyways, are you, are you, are you green?
[13394.60s -> 13395.16s]  Are you good?
[13395.16s -> 13395.72s]  Yeah.
[13395.72s -> 13398.24s]  Okay, I'm inviting you.
[13406.52s -> 13407.40s]  No screen thinking.
[13407.40s -> 13409.72s]  It is weird that we went through the whole game.
[13409.72s -> 13413.64s]  I mean, I know it was only three and a half hours, but still.
[13415.24s -> 13420.12s]  And one little decision at the very end dictates the entire.
[13421.94s -> 13425.94s]  Okay, so this is matters of the heart radio room, right?
[13426.66s -> 13427.70s]  Is the last scene.
[13428.93s -> 13429.89s]  I guess so.
[13429.89s -> 13431.65s]  Would you like to overwrite the current save?
[13432.45s -> 13434.20s]  No reason not to.
[13434.20s -> 13435.40s]  Is it the end?
[13435.40s -> 13436.60s]  No, it's not the end, is it?
[13444.95s -> 13446.37s]  Okay, here we go.
[13446.85s -> 13450.85s]  But anyway, my thought was if they made it where one person buys it and can invite
[13450.85s -> 13456.29s]  a friend for free for co-op and it might be worth $15 per person.
[13457.81s -> 13461.22s]  Maybe, but let's see what happens.
[13461.78s -> 13462.18s]  Let's see.
[13462.18s -> 13464.10s]  Let's try to get it because we had all five people.
[13467.43s -> 13471.43s]  Yeah, we had, everybody was alive up until the last second.
[13471.99s -> 13472.23s]  Yes.
[13473.11s -> 13475.91s]  And then the actual thing is saving the boat.
[13477.43s -> 13484.66s]  Okay, so we're going to, I'm not going to stab anything.
[13486.15s -> 13488.63s]  And then what, what, what you had to tap something to save the.
[13489.51s -> 13491.35s]  The, um, the.
[13491.35s -> 13492.71s]  All I have to do is open a door.
[13495.32s -> 13496.92s]  Somebody said the elevator was your fault.
[13497.64s -> 13501.28s]  Also, I don't know if that's true or not.
[13501.28s -> 13502.29s]  All right, here we go.
[13507.62s -> 13508.34s]  So same thing.
[13508.34s -> 13510.24s]  I'm you off list.
[13510.24s -> 13511.60s]  I'm Alex.
[13511.60s -> 13513.68s]  Why I'm going to check the next level.
[13513.68s -> 13515.36s]  There might be some more gear down there we can use.
[13516.24s -> 13519.04s]  Just wait by the radio.
[13519.76s -> 13521.60s]  I'm going to hang back here as well.
[13522.56s -> 13524.66s]  All right.
[13524.66s -> 13527.94s]  So when I did this last time, I apparently took too long doing this.
[13528.58s -> 13559.59s]  Just go and grab the thing who stays, who goes.
[13561.35s -> 13569.97s]  Okay.
[13570.93s -> 13574.23s]  He said the name of my stream.
[13574.23s -> 13575.59s]  He said the name of my stream.
[13577.03s -> 13580.55s]  I saw the big guy way too excited about this.
[13582.55s -> 13587.67s]  Uh, we just spotty swapped.
[13587.67s -> 13588.55s]  We didn't know.
[13589.97s -> 13590.29s]  All right.
[13590.29s -> 13591.09s]  So what was the thing?
[13591.09s -> 13592.37s]  What's the thing I'm supposed to grab?
[13593.17s -> 13597.89s]  We got to get the cap from the big guy.
[13599.83s -> 13602.63s]  And then we separate and then I, what was I supposed to get?
[13610.08s -> 13611.68s]  It just, it did just kind of end.
[13613.27s -> 13615.11s]  Just don't activate the elevator.
[13616.15s -> 13617.35s]  Don't activate the elevator.
[13617.99s -> 13621.89s]  This must have been what we just heard.
[13629.11s -> 13629.75s]  Okay.
[13629.75s -> 13630.31s]  Here we go.
[13630.31s -> 13630.87s]  What's that?
[13631.59s -> 13632.79s]  Does it matter?
[13632.79s -> 13635.27s]  We need that distributor cap here.
[13635.99s -> 13637.19s]  He had to have come this way.
[13638.15s -> 13643.68s]  You have to find the guy as fast as you can.
[13643.68s -> 13644.00s]  Okay.
[13645.12s -> 13646.85s]  I'll try.
[13647.89s -> 13650.05s]  I don't think I even have anything I can do.
[13650.05s -> 13650.69s]  I think I just.
[13656.48s -> 13658.55s]  Here we go.
[13661.19s -> 13663.28s]  All right.
[13663.28s -> 13664.00s]  He's holding it.
[13665.60s -> 13668.85s]  And then he reads down the hallway.
[13670.45s -> 13674.02s]  And then you have to jump successfully.
[13674.02s -> 13674.26s]  Yeah.
[13675.14s -> 13676.64s]  Should be excellent.
[13682.74s -> 13683.56s]  Okay.
[13683.56s -> 13685.30s]  I'm good.
[13685.30s -> 13687.25s]  There he is.
[13688.13s -> 13692.34s]  Okay.
[13693.22s -> 13695.96s]  It's Alex.
[13695.96s -> 13697.08s]  Don't open the door.
[13697.08s -> 13697.72s]  Somebody's saying.
[13697.72s -> 13699.08s]  I'm not, I'm not going to open the door.
[13699.80s -> 13708.47s]  Okay.
[13708.47s -> 13709.99s]  So where, where am I now?
[13710.63s -> 13718.95s]  So he's like just sitting in the corner down here.
[13719.91s -> 13726.63s]  I'm not going to make this jump, Alex.
[13726.63s -> 13727.99s]  I'll have to find another way around.
[13729.03s -> 13734.20s]  Did that happen last time?
[13734.20s -> 13734.76s]  I don't know.
[13735.16s -> 13735.88s]  I don't remember that.
[13736.84s -> 13738.20s]  Him just dying in the corner?
[13738.76s -> 13739.08s]  No, no.
[13739.08s -> 13739.72s]  I remember that.
[13740.36s -> 13742.44s]  But I can open this door, right?
[13742.44s -> 13744.28s]  They said don't open the elevator door.
[13744.28s -> 13744.52s]  Yeah.
[13744.52s -> 13745.40s]  I can open this door.
[13746.04s -> 13748.37s]  Okay.
[13748.37s -> 13749.01s]  Now, where is he?
[13749.57s -> 13755.59s]  Okay.
[13755.59s -> 13756.63s]  Oh, sorry.
[13757.19s -> 13757.51s]  RB.
[13758.98s -> 13759.22s]  Okay.
[13759.22s -> 13759.94s]  This scary thing.
[13759.94s -> 13761.30s]  One letter short of BRB.
[13762.39s -> 13763.03s]  Maybe that's why.
[13763.83s -> 13764.47s]  Minus two.
[13764.47s -> 13765.43s]  I, I took care of it.
[13765.43s -> 13766.07s]  Thank you, Chad.
[13766.07s -> 13766.55s]  Oh, okay.
[13767.43s -> 13771.12s]  Then now where is he?
[13771.12s -> 13772.40s]  Is he in this, this laundry room?
[13772.40s -> 13773.44s]  I was laundry room.
[13779.41s -> 13779.73s]  There.
[13779.73s -> 13779.97s]  Okay.
[13780.69s -> 13781.94s]  Let me see it.
[13782.82s -> 13786.15s]  I looked at this.
[13787.81s -> 13788.29s]  Okay.
[13788.29s -> 13789.89s]  Just trying to re-flip, retrace the steps.
[13790.53s -> 13791.49s]  You found a secret.
[13791.49s -> 13791.73s]  Good.
[13793.78s -> 13794.18s]  All right.
[13794.90s -> 13802.10s]  I didn't even know this was, this was here.
[13803.27s -> 13803.59s]  Okay.
[13805.17s -> 13805.97s]  I found it.
[13808.88s -> 13813.38s]  Fuck.
[13813.38s -> 13813.70s]  All right.
[13813.70s -> 13815.86s]  Do you, I'm, I'm about to be in possession.
[13816.50s -> 13821.04s]  You just can't look.
[13821.04s -> 13829.28s]  I just have to grab.
[13829.28s -> 13830.08s]  I'm, I'm going to get it.
[13834.31s -> 13836.31s]  What the fuck did you do that for?
[13840.16s -> 13840.48s]  Got it.
[13841.20s -> 13842.96s]  Okay.
[13842.96s -> 13843.52s]  I have the cap.
[13844.24s -> 13848.16s]  Alex has found a secret.
[13848.96s -> 13849.68s]  Did you just do that?
[13850.56s -> 13854.47s]  You, it, it yoinked me into the door.
[13855.35s -> 13855.99s]  I have the cap.
[13862.00s -> 13863.52s]  It doesn't look like you have the cap.
[13864.24s -> 13866.34s]  It looks like you're fighting a rat monster.
[13867.06s -> 13867.30s]  All right.
[13867.30s -> 13868.58s]  The cap is, we, we're good.
[13872.95s -> 13874.95s]  That's a sca, I knew it was coming.
[13875.51s -> 13876.47s]  Don't stab anybody.
[13878.08s -> 13878.56s]  Who are you?
[13880.40s -> 13886.71s]  Say nothing.
[13889.36s -> 13890.08s]  It looks sad.
[13891.41s -> 13891.65s]  Okay.
[13892.21s -> 13894.72s]  I'm afraid.
[13897.30s -> 13899.78s]  Okay.
[13901.00s -> 13901.16s]  No.
[13902.60s -> 13905.35s]  Now don't do anything.
[13912.96s -> 13914.88s]  No, I'm not going to kill him for the joke.
[13914.88s -> 13915.84s]  I want to beat the game.
[13916.72s -> 13927.59s]  Okay.
[13927.59s -> 13927.91s]  Okay.
[13933.91s -> 13934.15s]  Shit.
[13934.95s -> 13937.91s]  Now what?
[13937.91s -> 13944.68s]  How many times are you going to try and like?
[13945.97s -> 13946.45s]  It's okay.
[13947.68s -> 13948.16s]  There we are.
[13948.72s -> 13950.90s]  Fliss.
[13951.46s -> 13957.11s]  Gotcha.
[13957.83s -> 13959.96s]  That's five out of five.
[13959.96s -> 13961.24s]  I'm not even going to apologize.
[13962.12s -> 13963.08s]  Oh, Fliss, it's you.
[13963.08s -> 13963.72s]  All right, let's go.
[13964.36s -> 13966.85s]  That's a solid five out of five right there.
[13966.85s -> 13967.73s]  Hi, everyone's safe.
[13967.73s -> 13968.69s]  Everyone's alive.
[13968.69s -> 13971.25s]  That's all I needed was this piece of boat.
[13971.81s -> 13972.77s]  Now I can leave.
[13976.40s -> 13976.72s]  Okay.
[13976.72s -> 13978.96s]  If we get like gunned down here again.
[13980.08s -> 13981.28s]  They're going to set off in the boat,
[13981.28s -> 13982.32s]  that they came there in.
[13983.12s -> 13998.63s]  We did it.
[13998.63s -> 14001.27s]  Oh, you did it.
[14001.27s -> 14002.39s]  You saved everybody.
[14003.67s -> 14005.43s]  Did they write any dialogue for this ending?
[14006.39s -> 14009.73s]  Where's Conrad?
[14010.29s -> 14013.25s]  All right, let's try it.
[14029.14s -> 14030.26s]  Conrad's not on the boat.
[14030.90s -> 14036.48s]  There's only four people.
[14037.36s -> 14044.50s]  Everybody got their, the true timeline.
[14044.50s -> 14045.38s]  Everybody got their wish.
[14050.34s -> 14053.38s]  Conrad was just an hallucination from the gas.
[14053.38s -> 14054.42s]  That explains a lot.
[14055.14s -> 14056.34s]  He was kind of a monster.
[14057.46s -> 14060.80s]  This was about curing gold.
[14061.52s -> 14064.60s]  Well, that turned out to be quite a bit different than we expected.
[14065.32s -> 14067.62s]  You know, I just keep going over it and over it.
[14068.42s -> 14070.72s]  And it doesn't make any sense, you know?
[14070.72s -> 14073.64s]  And I know what I saw.
[14073.64s -> 14075.56s]  Well, guys, I found the paperwork that explains it.
[14075.56s -> 14078.60s]  Don't believe in whatever it was that I saw.
[14079.40s -> 14080.20s]  I saw Alex.
[14081.08s -> 14082.12s]  It wasn't Alex.
[14082.12s -> 14084.87s]  It was one else.
[14085.75s -> 14087.36s]  But they look just like Alex.
[14088.00s -> 14090.08s]  And he was sneering at me.
[14090.08s -> 14092.16s]  He doesn't really like explore very much of this, huh?
[14092.80s -> 14093.44s]  Oh, there he is.
[14093.44s -> 14099.60s]  It's kind of like, hey, if you breathe this stuff and you become a monster,
[14100.72s -> 14101.44s]  time to go home.
[14103.57s -> 14104.05s]  This guy.
[14104.85s -> 14109.33s]  Yeah, I feel like this game needed like another two full hours to like keep that going.
[14110.82s -> 14115.14s]  Well, they kind of did the you're a monster, not really in the prologue.
[14115.14s -> 14119.06s]  And then that there wasn't another thing for the rest of the game.
[14119.86s -> 14125.51s]  That was the joke trick gotcha moment in the first 25 minutes.
[14125.51s -> 14127.67s]  And then they just did it again two more times.
[14128.39s -> 14133.51s]  And I guess let's see how this let's see.
[14134.23s -> 14136.23s]  Let's see our critique from our professor here.
[14140.93s -> 14142.45s]  Rewinding to fix the story.
[14143.41s -> 14144.20s]  Pathetic.
[14148.87s -> 14151.03s]  Congratulations.
[14151.03s -> 14153.59s]  All your charges are still breathing.
[14153.59s -> 14156.47s]  And that's something I suppose.
[14157.43s -> 14163.03s]  Things became a little intense, but Alex kept his nerve.
[14163.03s -> 14164.23s]  Well done, Alex.
[14164.23s -> 14165.35s]  Well done, you.
[14165.35s -> 14169.60s]  Oh, it's all about decisions, isn't it?
[14169.60s -> 14176.24s]  Decisions made in a hurry in a panic made with the heart instead of the head or vice versa.
[14177.20s -> 14181.68s]  Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.
[14182.80s -> 14187.73s]  But there are repercussions for always repercussions.
[14188.69s -> 14200.55s]  Scream and watch out this dude's British.
[14200.55s -> 14205.11s]  We meet again, maybe in little hope, maybe somewhere else.
[14205.83s -> 14209.76s]  But be certain we will meet again.
[14210.80s -> 14213.20s]  It's inevitable.
[14219.38s -> 14221.54s]  All right, apparently we need to watch this.
[14222.74s -> 14224.10s]  I thought you just started singing.
[14224.74s -> 14225.94s]  I was like, holy shit.
[14225.94s -> 14226.66s]  Okay, I'm going to.
[14236.34s -> 14238.71s]  Oh, sorry, please.
[14239.75s -> 14241.43s]  All right, we're not supposed to watch after the credits.
[14241.43s -> 14242.23s]  Did you skip the credits?
[14243.43s -> 14244.47s]  Won't you spare me?
[14244.47s -> 14246.15s]  Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14246.15s -> 14246.95s]  We had to skip this.
[14246.95s -> 14247.75s]  We had to skip this part.
[14247.75s -> 14248.47s]  We got to get the credit.
[14248.47s -> 14249.43s]  Don't skip after this.
[14250.47s -> 14250.97s]  Here we go.
[14253.67s -> 14255.43s]  They're going to just shoot us when we get to the beach.
[14256.71s -> 14267.35s]  Already lived.
[14285.14s -> 14286.26s]  Oh, Danny, no.
[14287.06s -> 14287.56s]  Danny.
[14288.42s -> 14289.54s]  All right, they saved us.
[14291.11s -> 14292.07s]  Danny was alive.
[14292.71s -> 14299.86s]  Aren't they just going to they have gas masks on or just like.
[14301.14s -> 14303.94s]  So out of nowhere, this thing just sent out an SOS.
[14303.94s -> 14305.94s]  I guess we got a real life ghost ship here.
[14307.38s -> 14314.47s]  Well, what's rowdy pause the game.
[14314.47s -> 14316.07s]  Please reconnect your controller.
[14316.07s -> 14317.27s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[14325.67s -> 14328.39s]  Trying to ruin the perfect ending at the last second again, I see.
[14331.75s -> 14333.94s]  Well, what the hell is this?
[14336.93s -> 14340.53s]  Danny was dead and he wakes up to die again at the end.
[14340.53s -> 14341.81s]  Credits if you don't save him.
[14342.53s -> 14344.21s]  That is so hilariously stupid.
[14349.22s -> 14350.82s]  There's a lock on one of these.
[14350.82s -> 14355.27s]  I don't know if you were there with me when I investigated this room.
[14363.04s -> 14364.24s]  But they don't have a gun.
[14370.24s -> 14370.80s]  Never mind.
[14370.80s -> 14373.99s]  Danny is he breathed the mist.
[14385.20s -> 14388.00s]  And just like every other like HBO show you watch.
[14388.96s -> 14392.56s]  Here's the trailer for the big thing they got coming out next month.
[14399.56s -> 14406.12s]  Why are we watching this unskippable?
[14407.24s -> 14408.60s]  It is unskippable.
[14409.64s -> 14422.93s]  All right, we did it.
[14422.93s -> 14423.57s]  We did do it.
[14423.57s -> 14425.17s]  And that's not coming out till 2020.
[14426.21s -> 14429.92s]  I mean, there's only three months till 2020.
[14429.92s -> 14433.52s]  But yes, that seems like a long time, though, to have anybody like continue.
[14433.52s -> 14436.40s]  Oh, yeah, the dark, the dark picture is anthology.
[14437.68s -> 14439.12s]  To be clear, it's $30.
[14440.56s -> 14441.28s]  Not 40.
[14441.28s -> 14448.04s]  But you know, I'm not sure I agree with the C and four months mentality.
[14450.72s -> 14453.84s]  They're saying that for the for twice as much money,
[14453.84s -> 14456.00s]  probably less now that there's sales.
[14456.00s -> 14458.40s]  You could buy full price Detroit become human.
[14464.61s -> 14466.21s]  Yeah, I can't say.
[14466.21s -> 14468.61s]  I mean, it was it was funny.
[14469.17s -> 14470.77s]  There was some stuff that was interesting.
[14471.73s -> 14474.74s]  But I almost wish that they didn't do this whole.
[14474.74s -> 14479.70s]  Let's make like eight of these little games and just make one good one.
[14479.70s -> 14480.26s]  We're too good.
[14480.26s -> 14481.78s]  We don't want to do one or two, three.
[14482.74s -> 14483.22s]  Why eight?
[14484.10s -> 14487.22s]  Why not do three of these or two of these?
[14487.86s -> 14489.27s]  Why does it have to be that many?
[14495.78s -> 14497.84s]  Because I don't know.
[14497.84s -> 14499.76s]  It's in four and then in half.
[14499.76s -> 14502.16s]  I could just spend a little more time on each eight.
[14502.16s -> 14502.80s]  It's a lot.
[14502.80s -> 14504.40s]  Yeah, it's what is that?
[14504.40s -> 14505.84s]  They really want to do eight of these.
[14509.01s -> 14509.73s]  Is that for real?
[14510.37s -> 14513.33s]  But are they all $30 each?
[14514.13s -> 14517.32s]  I don't know.
[14517.32s -> 14519.24s]  That's like the most expensive DLC.
[14519.96s -> 14522.72s]  If they want to tell their stories, let them.
[14523.80s -> 14526.84s]  Yeah, but where we have to we're the ones buying them.
[14527.56s -> 14533.59s]  I guess we don't have to.
[14533.59s -> 14538.15s]  But I'm not on a subway sitting next to a guy telling like a scary story.
[14541.99s -> 14545.27s]  I think if you plan for eight, you have to be extremely confident about
[14545.27s -> 14546.55s]  how many sales you're going to get.
[14547.11s -> 14555.24s]  And I don't know if because Man of Medan seems to be kind of universally not anybody's favorite game.
[14556.20s -> 14559.96s]  So people will be willing to try the second time.
[14559.96s -> 14565.08s]  And if both the first two aren't up to par, then how are they going to make eight?
[14567.08s -> 14569.16s]  No one's going to buy three, four, five, six.
[14569.16s -> 14571.56s]  I mean, here's like a $500 IQ play.
[14571.56s -> 14576.04s]  Just wait like seven years for them all to go on like a steam sale.
[14577.08s -> 14584.13s]  Just wait for the Dark Pictures anthology, like eight game series to be like $11 in like 2028.
[14585.41s -> 14593.91s]  That's normal IQ.
[14593.91s -> 14594.47s]  Is it though?
[14594.47s -> 14595.91s]  It makes you I mean, that's pretty smart.
[14596.63s -> 14598.96s]  I like the idea.
[14598.96s -> 14605.12s]  I mean, until I would say the most fun part of the game was like that middle section when
[14606.24s -> 14608.40s]  you were like coming to get me.
[14608.96s -> 14611.92s]  And I thought you were the bad guy like in that middle section.
[14611.92s -> 14615.52s]  I think after that point, there was nothing left to tell.
[14615.52s -> 14620.08s]  Once once we figured, okay, once we figured that out, then it was kind of like, wait, oh.
[14621.04s -> 14623.60s]  And then they did like the kid runs across the screen two more times.
[14626.02s -> 14628.18s]  And then we just knew, you know, like, yeah.
[14628.58s -> 14633.38s]  After even if you even if we didn't talk about that, you ruined it, but you didn't ruin it.
[14633.38s -> 14636.52s]  Like when you said, hey, are you Brad?
[14636.52s -> 14637.56s]  Here's what I really thought.
[14637.56s -> 14641.56s]  Because what you didn't know is I took a five minute BRB because I'd take the dog outside.
[14642.28s -> 14646.92s]  And I just thought it would be funny because there was a guy on the ground with a bullet
[14646.92s -> 14648.52s]  in his chest and I thought he was cursed.
[14648.52s -> 14652.28s]  And I thought if I touched him that I would like wake him up and he'd become a zombie.
[14652.28s -> 14654.84s]  So I was just like, I'm just going to be here.
[14655.40s -> 14661.25s]  The second that I came back, you yoinked me into the next scene.
[14661.25s -> 14665.62s]  And that's when I was just getting chased by you.
[14665.62s -> 14666.90s]  So when you said, are you Brad?
[14666.90s -> 14670.74s]  What I thought was not that you were a good guy that I shouldn't kill,
[14670.74s -> 14674.42s]  but I thought you had taken over control as the ghost of the ship.
[14674.42s -> 14676.50s]  And you were going to it was going to I thought they were going to do like a
[14677.46s -> 14681.86s]  like a way out thing where we're actually adversarial for like the rest of the game.
[14681.86s -> 14685.06s]  Unfortunately, unfortunately, you didn't get my texts.
[14686.92s -> 14689.24s]  That's the one unfortunate part about this whole stream
[14690.44s -> 14692.92s]  because I wanted to change rooms.
[14695.60s -> 14699.28s]  I wanted to go into your room and you come into mine and like we're just like
[14700.08s -> 14703.04s]  for like I think people would have known immediately.
[14706.07s -> 14706.39s]  I don't know.
[14706.39s -> 14709.27s]  I really I think that would have been like instantaneously.
[14712.07s -> 14715.75s]  Because yeah, I would sound so much like better on your microphone.
[14718.29s -> 14719.97s]  I only had the camera on sometimes.
[14719.97s -> 14720.85s]  That's what I was asking.
[14720.85s -> 14723.49s]  I was like, hey, I'm like, hey, is your webcam on right now?
[14724.29s -> 14727.12s]  But I would have to leave it like full unmuted
[14728.64s -> 14730.08s]  because you wouldn't know where the button was.
[14732.12s -> 14733.40s]  I wouldn't know where it was.
[14733.40s -> 14734.76s]  I'd have to sneak into your room.
[14736.12s -> 14736.60s]  But all right.
[14736.60s -> 14737.24s]  Final thoughts.
[14737.96s -> 14740.44s]  Final thoughts on episode one.
[14741.48s -> 14742.92s]  Standalone Man of Medan.
[14744.69s -> 14751.52s]  I would say I like the idea of the shared co-op play
[14751.52s -> 14756.32s]  with a friend horror game unless you're going to play it in five player local
[14756.32s -> 14757.60s]  and everybody pitches it.
[14760.68s -> 14761.00s]  True.
[14761.92s -> 14765.72s]  But it's also it's six dollars a person.
[14766.77s -> 14768.69s]  It opens the door couch co-op.
[14771.46s -> 14773.86s]  You can play couch co-op local with five players.
[14775.84s -> 14779.36s]  Have a little movie night for three and a half hours and pass the controller around.
[14780.08s -> 14782.56s]  Yeah, you can just have fun with it.
[14782.56s -> 14787.22s]  I think it opens the door for potentially having horror games
[14787.62s -> 14792.02s]  and having co-op experiences that are like that kind of way out experience.
[14792.66s -> 14793.78s]  Try to do more of that.
[14794.66s -> 14797.38s]  Hey, you're both playing at the same time, but you're not doing the same things.
[14797.38s -> 14797.94s]  But you are.
[14797.94s -> 14798.50s]  But you aren't.
[14798.50s -> 14799.22s]  But are you?
[14799.22s -> 14799.70s]  You are.
[14800.82s -> 14802.10s]  It's an interesting take on co-op.
[14802.10s -> 14804.66s]  But just the problem was very good.
[14804.66s -> 14805.46s]  I don't think it was very good.
[14805.46s -> 14808.66s]  There was nothing in between the moments.
[14809.92s -> 14812.32s]  There were like probably four story beats in the game.
[14812.32s -> 14815.76s]  But the only thing you do between there is kind of you walk down the hall
[14815.76s -> 14817.44s]  and there's a piece of paper at the end.
[14817.44s -> 14819.36s]  And then the next thing happened.
[14821.14s -> 14823.30s]  Yeah, it was a lot of hallway walking.
[14824.02s -> 14828.66s]  And I mean, let's OK, here are the pros to this game.
[14829.62s -> 14832.02s]  It's very, very, very, very nice looking game.
[14833.62s -> 14837.70s]  I thought like the especially when they did when they did close ups,
[14837.70s -> 14841.06s]  I thought it was fucking fantastic graphics until they showed their teeth.
[14842.40s -> 14846.56s]  I didn't dislike any of the actual actors or the voice actors.
[14846.56s -> 14847.52s]  I thought that was all good.
[14855.54s -> 14855.86s]  Yeah.
[14856.82s -> 14861.30s]  Yeah, I was I was holding up to no comment and no response.
[14862.10s -> 14865.59s]  The graphics were fine.
[14865.59s -> 14871.92s]  Yeah, it was just kind of it was it was until dawn until dawn was so much better.
[14871.92s -> 14875.28s]  Like until dawn was five letter grades.
[14875.28s -> 14878.40s]  How come halfway through the game, there was a literal I am the captain now.
[14878.96s -> 14879.92s]  Look at me.
[14879.92s -> 14882.08s]  Yeah, I guess I am inevitable.
[14883.68s -> 14885.36s]  Yeah, I felt weird.
[14886.58s -> 14887.30s]  That did happen.
[14890.26s -> 14891.86s]  That did happen like more than once.
[14892.42s -> 14897.94s]  And there were a couple like dialogue options that just were out of nowhere.
[14898.58s -> 14902.05s]  What do you mean?
[14904.76s -> 14909.54s]  Mike, could you explain that again to me?
[14909.54s -> 14912.10s]  But in like not nerd terms, so I can understand.
[14913.06s -> 14919.52s]  And they would just I remember when you were like tonal shift, kind of weird, right?
[14919.52s -> 14923.20s]  Yeah, at least they said the name of the series.
[14925.36s -> 14925.92s]  Yeah, I did.
[14925.92s -> 14928.32s]  I did ruin Alex's proposal to Julia.
[14928.88s -> 14931.84s]  He proposed to Julia underwater when they were diving.
[14931.84s -> 14936.08s]  And I thought and I told him that he was being stupid.
[14937.28s -> 14937.68s]  Damn.
[14941.43s -> 14943.35s]  But that that's the end of that.
[14944.07s -> 14946.93s]  That's the end of the man of the Dan.
[14952.21s -> 14954.29s]  I haven't gone to the bathroom in four hours.
[14954.29s -> 14955.89s]  So and that's a first for me.
[14957.27s -> 14957.91s]  I'm going to go pee.
[14962.47s -> 14964.55s]  OK, I'll be back.
[14966.71s -> 14967.35s]  What time is it?
[14968.23s -> 14970.15s]  It's been about four hours.
[14970.87s -> 14972.32s]  I'm not sure there's anything else.
[14972.32s -> 14974.24s]  Is there anything else we can do for like an hour?
[14977.94s -> 14978.58s]  Maybe.
[14979.86s -> 14985.84s]  What was the point of the satanic book?
[14985.84s -> 14989.28s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14989.28s -> 14990.80s]  No, that wasn't I wasn't full of shit there.
[14990.80s -> 14994.40s]  I found a Satan room with a Satan book and told me all these Satan spells.
[14995.36s -> 14996.88s]  Was it just a red herring?
[14996.88s -> 14998.48s]  I think it was just a hallucination.
[14998.48s -> 15000.00s]  Yeah, it was just that was not real.
[15000.00s -> 15001.12s]  And I was making it all up.
[15002.53s -> 15004.77s]  See how fast you can kill everyone in the game.
[15005.73s -> 15009.57s]  You want to try to just kill everybody's faster again.
[15009.57s -> 15010.45s]  That's not a bad idea.
[15011.41s -> 15012.69s]  Just fail every QT.
[15013.73s -> 15015.49s]  Yeah, let's try to kill everybody as fast as possible.
[15015.49s -> 15015.97s]  See what happens.
[15016.93s -> 15017.17s]  All right.
[15017.17s -> 15018.05s]  Yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[15018.85s -> 15021.01s]  We're going to play the game again, but we're going to kill everyone
[15021.01s -> 15023.09s]  as soon as possible to try to do it in less than 30 minutes.
[15024.05s -> 15025.43s]  I'll be right back.
[15025.43s -> 15026.23s]  I'm going to go pee.
[15026.23s -> 15028.79s]  OK, I'll just mute you and everything.
[15029.67s -> 15035.80s]  I'll be right back as Pete.
[15036.60s -> 15161.32s]  Hello.
[15162.92s -> 15169.41s]  Hey, yeah, you get disconnected.
[15171.17s -> 15171.57s]  Did I?
[15173.17s -> 15173.97s]  Oh, we went down.
[15176.53s -> 15176.85s]  Yep.
[15178.05s -> 15181.68s]  I turned off the VEEP.
[15181.68s -> 15183.52s]  So the VPN makes any difference.
[15185.76s -> 15187.92s]  Yeah, it looks like the VPN lost connection.
[15189.17s -> 15189.89s]  Huh.
[15189.89s -> 15191.59s]  Well, that's irritating.
[15191.59s -> 15228.96s]  But it's people saying it's Twitch.
[15230.40s -> 15233.17s]  People saying I don't believe it is.
[15233.97s -> 15235.41s]  But why would it be working?
[15235.41s -> 15236.69s]  We both went down at the same time.
[15236.69s -> 15238.85s]  It says people saying Twitch's servers are shitting the bed right now.
[15238.85s -> 15240.45s]  A bunch of streamers are going offline.
[15241.65s -> 15242.45s]  Maybe so.
[15242.45s -> 15242.93s]  Maybe that is.
[15242.93s -> 15244.13s]  Maybe it's not the VPN.
[15244.13s -> 15245.33s]  Either way, it's not Cox.
[15246.21s -> 15247.41s]  Yeah, it's not.
[15247.41s -> 15249.65s]  It's not an Internet issue, apparently.
[15249.65s -> 15250.13s]  For once.
[15254.44s -> 15255.48s]  It's Twitch, apparently.
[15257.20s -> 15261.24s]  OK, you ready to try this?
[15261.24s -> 15262.04s]  See if we can do this.
[15262.92s -> 15265.96s]  I'm going to say we should start like halfway through the story.
[15269.46s -> 15272.58s]  Is it possible to skip like dialogue?
[15272.58s -> 15274.58s]  I'm assuming we can probably...
[15276.74s -> 15279.62s]  We can probably just go to the part where the boat gets...
[15280.74s -> 15284.82s]  Well, I think if we wanted to start from the beginning,
[15284.82s -> 15288.34s]  if you just don't look at anything other than the next objective,
[15288.34s -> 15291.30s]  doesn't that just throw the story into the next beat?
[15292.93s -> 15297.33s]  Because can't you fail a bunch of QTEs as the two sailors?
[15298.93s -> 15301.65s]  Can you start from the chapter after we do the punching
[15302.61s -> 15304.05s]  QTE and fortune?
[15305.09s -> 15306.13s]  That's what I'm saying.
[15306.13s -> 15308.13s]  Yeah, that's what we should just skip the prologue.
[15308.93s -> 15310.47s]  I got an invite for you.
[15311.35s -> 15316.63s]  A bunch of QTEs.
[15316.63s -> 15318.07s]  All right, so scene selection.
[15319.68s -> 15321.84s]  We've got Chinese market, the Duke.
[15323.78s -> 15326.50s]  So Chinese market, I believe, is...
[15326.50s -> 15327.22s]  This is all you.
[15328.26s -> 15329.48s]  The Duke is the boat.
[15330.12s -> 15333.48s]  So like we can't just skip that Chinese market part.
[15334.04s -> 15337.75s]  We have to start at that when we are on the boat.
[15338.39s -> 15341.78s]  Okay, we're just going to start at the Duke.
[15341.78s -> 15342.74s]  And here we go.
[15342.74s -> 15343.54s]  Start the timer now.
[15344.26s -> 15350.69s]  Here we go.
[15350.69s -> 15362.72s]  All right, try to get as fast as we can.
[15363.52s -> 15370.12s]  Have everyone just say nothing.
[15370.12s -> 15371.48s]  Yeah, just only just don't talk.
[15372.28s -> 15380.42s]  I'm trying to skip.
[15382.58s -> 15384.80s]  Well, you've artificially...
[15390.76s -> 15391.88s]  All right, here come the beards.
[15391.88s -> 15398.12s]  Uh-oh, we got twitched.
[15399.25s -> 15399.81s]  Wait, we did?
[15401.35s -> 15401.83s]  Are you down?
[15401.83s -> 15402.39s]  Are you zero?
[15403.35s -> 15404.95s]  Yeah, I'm...
[15404.95s -> 15407.03s]  Oh, well, if you're not, then I guess we'll just keep going.
[15407.03s -> 15408.87s]  But it's getting kind of miserable.
[15408.87s -> 15410.63s]  Yeah, this might be like a...
[15412.90s -> 15414.02s]  This is making no sense.
[15414.66s -> 15419.68s]  Apparently, Twitch is just going down.
[15420.40s -> 15423.62s]  Because you're fine, right?
[15423.62s -> 15425.30s]  Yeah, I'm fine completely, like 100%.
[15425.30s -> 15426.26s]  Okay, so it's...
[15426.26s -> 15427.78s]  Are you on VPN right now?
[15427.78s -> 15428.02s]  No.
[15428.66s -> 15431.24s]  Me neither.
[15431.80s -> 15435.03s]  So, yeah, something's going on.
[15435.03s -> 15436.07s]  Who's DDoSing Twitch?
[15436.63s -> 15437.11s]  I don't know.
[15437.11s -> 15437.83s]  That's a good question.
[15440.82s -> 15442.74s]  Let's just try to get rid of this.
[15442.74s -> 15443.86s]  Yeah, well, the thing is I...
[15444.74s -> 15445.86s]  Oh, you're out of the game?
[15445.86s -> 15446.18s]  I'm...
[15446.18s -> 15449.38s]  No, I'm going to have to alt-tab in a second.
[15450.02s -> 15451.70s]  And that's going to force pause the game.
[15452.34s -> 15453.06s]  There's Alex.
[15456.55s -> 15457.83s]  I'm going to try changing servers.
[15458.39s -> 15462.39s]  Well, thankfully, this all started really happening when we finished the game.
[15462.39s -> 15462.63s]  Yes.
[15463.27s -> 15472.23s]  Think we got enough?
[15472.23s -> 15474.60s]  If we run out, we can always call for backup.
[15474.60s -> 15475.72s]  All right, say nothing.
[15475.72s -> 15478.88s]  So, look, I've never been down there before.
[15479.76s -> 15480.56s]  All right, I got out water.
[15481.68s -> 15484.56s]  Don't blame me.
[15485.12s -> 15485.84s]  Blame Twitch.
[15486.64s -> 15488.32s]  No, no one's blaming you.
[15488.96s -> 15490.95s]  Don't worry.
[15492.37s -> 15493.09s]  I'm blaming me?
[15494.37s -> 15495.25s]  I want to see what happens.
[15495.97s -> 15501.51s]  Let me know when you're ready.
[15501.51s -> 15507.14s]  Are you playing different characters to see this stuff?
[15507.78s -> 15510.82s]  No, we're trying to see how fast we can have somebody die.
[15513.12s -> 15514.80s]  We're not going real fast.
[15514.80s -> 15517.28s]  We're going at lightning speed at the moment.
[15523.67s -> 15526.69s]  All right, let's try here.
[15529.68s -> 15531.28s]  You doing a new server?
[15531.84s -> 15532.08s]  Yeah.
[15537.88s -> 15540.10s]  Okay, try again.
[15540.10s -> 15545.27s]  Twitch TV server problems.
[15545.83s -> 15546.15s]  Ready.
[15546.87s -> 15549.73s]  Choose an EU server.
[15549.73s -> 15550.29s]  Diving.
[15550.29s -> 15551.49s]  Um, I don't know if we failed it.
[15551.49s -> 15552.85s]  Maybe you could show me how the pros are.
[15553.09s -> 15554.21s]  Up that high.
[15561.54s -> 15563.14s]  All right, say nothing.
[15563.70s -> 15564.10s]  Always.
[15568.40s -> 15571.04s]  Well, anyway, let's get this all loaded up.
[15572.72s -> 15574.32s]  I think he was going to say something there, too.
[15574.32s -> 15574.64s]  Careful.
[15575.36s -> 15578.16s]  That dive cam is like super expensive.
[15578.16s -> 15578.80s]  Be cool.
[15578.80s -> 15579.52s]  What?
[15579.52s -> 15582.88s]  Julia and Conrad are, you know, how do I say it?
[15582.88s -> 15584.16s]  Super fucking loaded.
[15584.16s -> 15584.88s]  So?
[15584.88s -> 15586.16s]  Don't sweat the little stuff, man.
[15586.16s -> 15586.88s]  It's not cool.
[15587.68s -> 15588.40s]  Don't make me regret.
[15589.12s -> 15594.98s]  Oh, cool.
[15594.98s -> 15598.85s]  Uh, is it a DDoS?
[15598.85s -> 15599.73s]  You tag along.
[15599.73s -> 15601.17s]  No, the internet's fine.
[15601.17s -> 15601.41s]  It's just...
[15601.41s -> 15607.49s]  Well, no, I'm done with the people saying that it is like up to Twitch or something.
[15608.37s -> 15609.99s]  All right, amigo.
[15609.99s -> 15610.87s]  Calvary's almost here.
[15610.87s -> 15611.59s]  Cool.
[15611.59s -> 15612.95s]  Sorry I'm a little snappy.
[15612.95s -> 15613.35s]  I'm just...
[15614.39s -> 15616.31s]  The new medical school would be stressful, you know?
[15616.31s -> 15617.19s]  Total shocker.
[15617.19s -> 15621.19s]  And man, the long distance thing, Julia, it's been rough.
[15624.07s -> 15625.35s]  Just random people saying that.
[15625.43s -> 15626.39s]  Yeah, well then I'm like...
[15626.39s -> 15627.43s]  Yeah, it's probably not, oh.
[15631.84s -> 15633.04s]  I'm just very shocked.
[15634.56s -> 15635.04s]  Me, too.
[15636.40s -> 15638.74s]  I guess I keep these in an underskills location.
[15638.74s -> 15639.24s]  Flushing.
[15646.96s -> 15651.06s]  Hey, so, uh, can I get your input on something?
[15651.62s -> 15652.58s]  Yeah, what?
[15652.58s -> 15656.61s]  Just, uh, kind of a big thing I'm trying to make a decision about.
[15658.16s -> 15659.68s]  About finishing med school?
[15659.68s -> 15660.48s]  And you said no.
[15661.20s -> 15665.12s]  So you were talking about wanting to do this and then down there you said no.
[15666.02s -> 15670.34s]  Imagine if him being in med school allowed him to solve anyone's
[15670.34s -> 15671.94s]  medical problems throughout this game.
[15674.93s -> 15679.65s]  Or if that character backstory was written, uh, after the rest of the game.
[15680.45s -> 15681.90s]  Teeth.
[15682.44s -> 15684.95s]  No one's figured it out yet.
[15685.67s -> 15695.52s]  Is this gonna take another three hours?
[15695.52s -> 15697.44s]  Um, I hope.
[15697.44s -> 15698.40s]  No, I hope not.
[15698.40s -> 15699.36s]  Hey, what's up, man?
[15699.36s -> 15699.86s]  Conrad.
[15701.25s -> 15701.97s]  Watch it, sis.
[15702.69s -> 15703.65s]  Lady killer, right here.
[15704.69s -> 15706.77s]  Good to finally meet you, Conrad.
[15707.57s -> 15708.71s]  This is Brad, by the way.
[15708.71s -> 15709.35s]  My little bro.
[15709.91s -> 15710.41s]  Hey.
[15710.41s -> 15711.43s]  Bradley!
[15711.43s -> 15713.91s]  Feel like I already know you have heard so much about ya.
[15713.91s -> 15717.19s]  All right, so remember, every dangerous potential scenario, uh,
[15717.19s -> 15720.15s]  do the option that is trying to get that person killed.
[15721.19s -> 15723.75s]  So is that Julia?
[15724.55s -> 15725.05s]  Yeah.
[15725.35s -> 15727.19s]  Is Julia blonde by the end of the game?
[15727.19s -> 15728.47s]  Geez, you have to think about it that hard.
[15728.47s -> 15729.11s]  She's blonde now?
[15729.11s -> 15729.99s]  I'm gonna guess the answer is no.
[15730.95s -> 15731.99s]  Maybe it's just the lighting.
[15731.99s -> 15733.11s]  First dive, you and me?
[15734.79s -> 15735.83s]  If you can keep up this time.
[15742.84s -> 15744.20s]  Whoa, whoa, cool down.
[15744.20s -> 15745.56s]  Don't go crazy with excitement.
[15747.00s -> 15749.88s]  We'll both do it.
[15749.88s -> 15750.92s]  That's so funny.
[15751.80s -> 15755.32s]  What a boring, shitty play through this could be, if you really wanted it to be.
[15756.36s -> 15759.40s]  Yeah, absolutely no personality.
[15759.40s -> 15761.16s]  No personality, no decision making.
[15761.80s -> 15763.72s]  I like my main character's blank slate.
[15763.72s -> 15766.04s]  I like to put myself into their shoes.
[15766.68s -> 15777.44s]  I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but, uh,
[15777.44s -> 15782.50s]  so is everybody on board and ready to go?
[15783.46s -> 15787.81s]  So it turned out that she was full of shit.
[15787.81s -> 15789.81s]  About the, like, don't disturb dead people thing.
[15790.53s -> 15791.25s]  Oh, yeah.
[15791.25s -> 15792.45s]  You're selling, I'm buying.
[15794.98s -> 15797.24s]  They weren't cursed at all.
[15797.24s -> 15800.12s]  It was just the military miasma.
[15808.74s -> 15813.86s]  All right, when's the first scenario where everyone could just die?
[15814.90s -> 15817.86s]  Well, there's an underwater segment here in a second, isn't there?
[15817.86s -> 15818.42s]  There is, yeah.
[15818.42s -> 15820.02s]  And the barbecue explosions.
[15822.12s -> 15823.40s]  But you already messed that up.
[15824.63s -> 15825.59s]  Yeah, all right.
[15825.59s -> 15827.03s]  What's the fastest way we can get out of this?
[15827.59s -> 15829.75s]  Is just go say we're ready, right?
[15829.75s -> 15831.70s]  What about over here?
[15832.50s -> 15833.70s]  That's pretty far out of the way.
[15834.34s -> 15837.54s]  I'm currently scrolling through this iPad.
[15837.54s -> 15840.50s]  Listen, to be honest, I've never heard of this wreck you're looking for.
[15840.50s -> 15842.50s]  Usually these things are crawling with divers.
[15842.50s -> 15843.86s]  Well, how do you do that?
[15843.86s -> 15844.66s]  Look at this.
[15844.66s -> 15845.62s]  This one's different.
[15845.62s -> 15850.18s]  I'm just saying, if it gets too late, I know some nice places where you can just take, you know,
[15850.18s -> 15850.82s]  a nice dive.
[15857.36s -> 15858.72s]  Just think about it.
[15858.72s -> 15861.56s]  I'm gonna go help Conrad and Julia with the camera.
[15861.56s -> 15866.44s]  I'm just so slow to process all information.
[15867.40s -> 15873.76s]  Feast your eyes on this.
[15874.48s -> 15876.24s]  Whoa, hey, look at that.
[15876.24s -> 15876.88s]  What is it?
[15876.88s -> 15877.84s]  Looks like a bomber.
[15877.84s -> 15878.48s]  Can you zoom in?
[15879.20s -> 15881.60s]  Oh, yeah, definitely a B-29.
[15881.60s -> 15882.48s]  That's good, right?
[15882.48s -> 15883.36s]  Are kittens good?
[15883.92s -> 15885.20s]  Are miniature horses good?
[15886.08s -> 15887.60s]  Hey, I freaking nailed it, bro.
[15887.60s -> 15889.28s]  Don't I get a little end zone dance?
[15889.92s -> 15890.32s]  Watch me.
[15890.96s -> 15891.44s]  Oh, yeah.
[15892.16s -> 15892.64s]  Oh, yeah.
[15894.64s -> 15896.56s]  So the B-29 is a super fortress.
[15898.24s -> 15901.52s]  During World War II, they built these suckers to cruise at the highest altitude possible
[15901.52s -> 15904.56s]  while maintaining the ability to carry nuclear warheads.
[15904.56s -> 15906.56s]  They were just, like, so dope.
[15906.56s -> 15907.92s]  Ah, so dope.
[15907.92s -> 15908.56s]  Oh, my God.
[15909.92s -> 15910.56s]  Look at me.
[15910.56s -> 15911.12s]  Sorry, yeah.
[15911.76s -> 15912.32s]  Look at me.
[15913.36s -> 15914.24s]  Please keep going.
[15916.24s -> 15917.92s]  Fliss, we found a plane.
[15917.92s -> 15918.32s]  Yeah?
[15918.32s -> 15920.00s]  Yeah, looks like World War II.
[15920.00s -> 15921.04s]  We are ready to dive.
[15923.04s -> 15927.60s]  Technically, we should call this in to port authorities as an unreported wreck.
[15928.00s -> 15928.64s]  Technically.
[15929.92s -> 15931.76s]  Are you sure you don't want to do this the right way?
[15934.82s -> 15937.06s]  Have a good think about that one before you respond.
[15938.71s -> 15939.99s]  Guys, no one knows.
[15939.99s -> 15940.95s]  No one cares.
[15940.95s -> 15941.99s]  No harm, no foul.
[15941.99s -> 15944.31s]  The computer is starting to answer for us.
[15949.92s -> 15951.84s]  Look, we picked for this guy.
[15951.84s -> 15953.20s]  Generously, we're dying.
[15953.20s -> 15954.40s]  The AI has taken over.
[15955.62s -> 15957.54s]  They have to push the story along somehow.
[15960.63s -> 15962.15s]  Say nothing is an illusion.
[15962.15s -> 15963.27s]  Can you imagine?
[15963.27s -> 15963.91s]  Untouched?
[15964.79s -> 15967.35s]  I am going to do some reading up on B-29s.
[15971.04s -> 15976.87s]  So what happens if we don't control the game at all?
[15979.27s -> 15983.51s]  I tried that and eventually it just forced me to go to the next area.
[15983.51s -> 15985.03s]  I still don't know what happened.
[15985.91s -> 15987.03s]  I may have pulled you.
[15987.03s -> 15988.07s]  Maybe you should check on your bro.
[15988.07s -> 15990.15s]  Yeah, no, it was unexplainable.
[15997.57s -> 15998.29s]  Okay, we're gonna have to move.
[15998.29s -> 16000.53s]  We both just stood here for 10 full minutes.
[16001.25s -> 16003.72s]  Hold on, what's the thing that moves us along?
[16004.12s -> 16005.64s]  I think we have to go downstairs.
[16007.48s -> 16010.60s]  I have to go downstairs and then they call us back up.
[16011.40s -> 16014.87s]  Oh wait, no, you're down in that new cutscene area.
[16014.87s -> 16015.59s]  I can't go in there.
[16016.15s -> 16016.71s]  Oh yeah, I can.
[16018.71s -> 16023.38s]  Okay, here we go.
[16030.15s -> 16031.03s]  Yeah, I have to do this.
[16031.43s -> 16032.63s]  I don't know what's going on.
[16046.05s -> 16048.53s]  I feel like these, there's no...
[16055.89s -> 16057.33s]  It's like, oh, relationship updated.
[16057.33s -> 16059.65s]  You've seen that like a bunch of times in the top left of the screen, right?
[16060.61s -> 16061.65s]  Yeah, I don't know what it means.
[16061.65s -> 16062.61s]  What the fuck does that mean?
[16063.89s -> 16066.61s]  It's kind of like Alex will remember that.
[16067.01s -> 16069.17s]  Yeah, but they don't accept.
[16069.17s -> 16071.73s]  Maybe it only matters if you're a single player?
[16071.73s -> 16072.21s]  I don't know.
[16073.01s -> 16075.73s]  Because the AI has to control some of the reactions.
[16078.34s -> 16079.62s]  He's stoned out of his mind.
[16080.34s -> 16083.96s]  All right, here we go.
[16084.68s -> 16086.64s]  You can't go in there.
[16086.64s -> 16090.16s]  I know, but we have to like do all the random things and then she goes, tanks are ready.
[16099.16s -> 16105.25s]  See, okay, what is this, what is this a painting of?
[16105.89s -> 16107.81s]  This premonition here, is that just of the storm?
[16109.46s -> 16111.30s]  Where Brad is like, oh no.
[16113.22s -> 16121.22s]  Oh, yeah, it didn't have to be annoying.
[16123.86s -> 16135.17s]  All right, let's do it.
[16137.33s -> 16137.89s]  I'm doing it.
[16140.85s -> 16142.21s]  I'm doing it.
[16142.21s -> 16142.77s]  I'm doing it.
[16148.40s -> 16149.20s]  Literally none.
[16153.52s -> 16155.44s]  This may as well be striking in human.
[16155.44s -> 16158.88s]  I'm just an android that hasn't been programmed yet.
[16160.80s -> 16166.15s]  If she tries to keep me from doing this dive one more time, that's it, gloves off.
[16166.15s -> 16167.03s]  That's fair.
[16167.03s -> 16168.95s]  Just don't force her hand.
[16170.31s -> 16174.23s]  All right, I'm gonna get these rebreather set up and then we'll go through the final steps together.
[16174.23s -> 16176.31s]  Cool, just holler at us.
[16176.31s -> 16177.11s]  Nothing to say.
[16180.16s -> 16182.72s]  Do what you want.
[16182.72s -> 16184.40s]  You're not gonna listen to me anyways.
[16185.12s -> 16189.52s]  But if you take one thing from that wreck, you're gonna make us all criminals.
[16193.91s -> 16195.19s]  Relationship updated.
[16198.87s -> 16199.43s]  What about me?
[16204.42s -> 16206.02s]  Nobody ended up being a traitor.
[16207.30s -> 16210.50s]  Nobody got into any kind of relationship.
[16211.46s -> 16214.28s]  Well, the people were gonna get married, I guess, but.
[16215.65s -> 16218.69s]  Every time I take a group of you people out, it's the same thing.
[16219.25s -> 16221.17s]  No regard for anyone else's customs.
[16221.89s -> 16224.45s]  These rules are all pretty basic stuff.
[16225.25s -> 16228.05s]  How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?
[16228.05s -> 16229.73s]  Oh, shit, this is a hard one.
[16231.33s -> 16238.71s]  Like, if you're silent for this long, through this many questions, you might be a serial killer.
[16239.43s -> 16241.19s]  No, you just don't like fucking ask it.
[16241.19s -> 16243.43s]  For all you know, this could be a war grave.
[16244.31s -> 16246.55s]  Disturbing it would be illegal and immoral.
[16252.08s -> 16255.36s]  They just said to cool it with your desperate pickup bullshit.
[16255.36s -> 16258.32s]  I haven't said a word as Conrad the entire game.
[16258.32s -> 16259.84s]  Just respect the rules down there.
[16259.84s -> 16262.24s]  Don't do anything stupid that'll get my ass in trouble.
[16265.36s -> 16267.44s]  I haven't said anything.
[16267.44s -> 16268.32s]  No, nothing.
[16269.68s -> 16271.52s]  Hey, at least I'm honest.
[16271.52s -> 16272.16s]  Still gross.
[16273.04s -> 16274.40s]  All right, are we ready to go in?
[16275.52s -> 16277.81s]  He's so desperate, he said nothing.
[16323.27s -> 16325.11s]  I'm standing next to you.
[16325.11s -> 16328.71s]  I'm standing right next to you, like, as if I can see as far as you.
[16328.71s -> 16330.63s]  There's nothing to even find out here.
[16332.48s -> 16333.12s]  Maybe there is.
[16333.92s -> 16334.72s]  This is freaking me out.
[16334.72s -> 16335.68s]  What the fuck?
[16335.68s -> 16344.76s]  I just got a little oopsie.
[16345.40s -> 16347.44s]  Oh, are you?
[16348.08s -> 16348.40s]  What?
[16349.75s -> 16351.43s]  Oh, you just you just like took me out of it.
[16353.28s -> 16354.64s]  Well, I was in a trance.
[16354.64s -> 16357.36s]  Just the camera zoomed in on my face and I just took I had it was in a trance.
[16362.45s -> 16363.41s]  Are you up?
[16363.41s -> 16364.21s]  Oh, yeah, I'm up.
[16365.01s -> 16368.60s]  Oh, at this point, I've got a bit of it happens.
[16368.60s -> 16369.08s]  It happens.
[16369.08s -> 16372.37s]  They just go, you know what I'm saying?
[16373.25s -> 16377.67s]  Do I not press A?
[16377.67s -> 16378.15s]  What's going on?
[16378.15s -> 16379.03s]  What is going on?
[16379.99s -> 16382.98s]  Jerma has to talk to Julia.
[16382.98s -> 16386.02s]  Okay, so this is the rebreather.
[16386.02s -> 16388.58s]  Way cooler than a regular scuba setup.
[16388.58s -> 16392.02s]  It takes all that CO2 that you normally just exhale into the water.
[16392.02s -> 16394.34s]  And instead, it gets totally reused.
[16394.34s -> 16396.58s]  Then it reduces decompression time on your way up.
[16397.22s -> 16397.94s]  State of the art.
[16399.46s -> 16401.38s]  You guys are going to enter the game world.
[16401.38s -> 16402.34s]  Maybe done.
[16403.38s -> 16407.60s]  Yeah, we're not going down at the same time.
[16407.60s -> 16410.32s]  So if you have the squad stream open, no one's missing anything.
[16411.68s -> 16413.68s]  Oh, yeah, just good old squad stream.
[16418.00s -> 16419.36s]  Ready to take the plunge?
[16419.36s -> 16420.32s]  Oh, hey, guys.
[16420.96s -> 16422.64s]  What? Jesus, why are you so loud?
[16422.64s -> 16423.92s]  I almost completely forgot.
[16423.92s -> 16427.12s]  When I was looking at the dive cam, I saw this huge hole in the tail.
[16427.12s -> 16428.96s]  I probably should put like a disclaimer somewhere,
[16428.96s -> 16432.80s]  like on this top of the stream that just says this is a fuck face run.
[16432.80s -> 16433.84s]  Okay, you little clown.
[16433.84s -> 16436.40s]  Someone has definitely come in here.
[16436.40s -> 16437.44s]  You behave, Connie.
[16437.44s -> 16438.08s]  Like, oh, good.
[16438.08s -> 16439.04s]  I got here just in time.
[16439.04s -> 16439.68s]  We just started.
[16440.80s -> 16442.08s]  Can't wait to see what they do next.
[16443.65s -> 16444.45s]  Say nothing.
[16444.45s -> 16445.57s]  I'm not taking any of this stuff.
[16455.04s -> 16456.56s]  And now I have nothing to say.
[16460.12s -> 16461.16s]  I'm so high.
[16463.80s -> 16464.60s]  God, come on.
[16466.60s -> 16468.92s]  These two are baked out of their minds.
[16468.92s -> 16471.48s]  This is just like, we like...
[16471.48s -> 16472.52s]  It just husks.
[16474.71s -> 16475.35s]  Oh, shit.
[16475.35s -> 16476.07s]  What should I do?
[16482.66s -> 16484.50s]  You're not in a good state to go down there.
[16485.54s -> 16487.22s]  No, you shouldn't be going down here.
[16495.12s -> 16500.39s]  All right, so there's a moment in the plane
[16501.59s -> 16503.11s]  when I take off the rebreather.
[16504.07s -> 16507.43s]  And swim into a cramped location.
[16508.31s -> 16511.75s]  But there's a QTE, so I want to see if that does anything.
[16512.31s -> 16512.95s]  I think...
[16512.95s -> 16513.83s]  You're Conrad.
[16515.91s -> 16516.63s]  I'm underwater.
[16516.63s -> 16517.75s]  You're on grill duty.
[16517.75s -> 16518.23s]  Wait, what?
[16519.67s -> 16521.67s]  I mean, I'm seeing the underwater segment.
[16522.87s -> 16524.23s]  You just Conrad and wasn't I, Alex?
[16524.79s -> 16526.31s]  Yeah, we got swabbed last time, though.
[16526.31s -> 16527.59s]  Did we get switched again here?
[16528.39s -> 16533.59s]  Howdy, Captain.
[16533.59s -> 16533.99s]  No, I'm...
[16534.63s -> 16536.39s]  Oh, yeah, it did swap us.
[16536.39s -> 16539.43s]  You are not my second-in-command, third-in-command.
[16539.43s -> 16539.75s]  No.
[16539.75s -> 16540.95s]  Fresh and eager cabin boy.
[16540.95s -> 16541.83s]  Still a no.
[16541.83s -> 16545.03s]  You're well-paying dashingly handsome seafaring client.
[16545.03s -> 16548.15s]  It's requesting the pleasure of your company over a frosty amber liquid.
[16549.91s -> 16553.17s]  Oh, she's been infected.
[16554.58s -> 16555.08s]  Okay.
[16555.78s -> 16556.82s]  You snooze, you lose.
[16557.70s -> 16560.61s]  Pretty nice ride you got here.
[16561.17s -> 16561.97s]  Where'd you get the cash?
[16562.85s -> 16565.32s]  I feel like it'd be cool for a game about choices
[16565.32s -> 16567.24s]  to give you a choice as to who you want to be.
[16567.96s -> 16568.84s]  That's true, yeah.
[16568.84s -> 16570.76s]  Sorry, I overstepped my bounds.
[16570.76s -> 16571.32s]  Switch computers.
[16571.32s -> 16573.24s]  We just take turns, each chapter,
[16574.36s -> 16575.96s]  choosing which squad to go with.
[16576.60s -> 16577.24s]  You know what?
[16577.24s -> 16580.12s]  I better spend some time keeping the Duke of Milan shipshape.
[16580.12s -> 16582.92s]  I really hope that I can just burn the boat down.
[16583.72s -> 16584.76s]  It's not gonna happen, though.
[16584.76s -> 16586.36s]  I'm gonna get stepped over.
[16587.56s -> 16589.00s]  I'm gonna get stepped over.
[16590.04s -> 16595.24s]  It's gonna happen anyways.
[16604.76s -> 16606.53s]  That is not your everyday wreck.
[16607.09s -> 16608.93s]  I hope those clowns don't get me in trouble.
[16608.93s -> 16611.49s]  Well, I just gotta cut on my leg and tetanus, so...
[16611.65s -> 16612.45s]  No, put it down.
[16617.94s -> 16618.50s]  Hey there.
[16618.50s -> 16623.38s]  How's it hanging?
[16624.42s -> 16624.98s]  I get it.
[16624.98s -> 16631.65s]  Busy, busy, busy.
[16632.37s -> 16634.61s]  You can monitor the dive while I do some boat maintenance.
[16634.61s -> 16635.49s]  Not a prob, Bob.
[16636.85s -> 16637.57s]  Okay, whatever.
[16637.57s -> 16644.48s]  Can we take a second to say that it's weird
[16645.84s -> 16650.60s]  that to play multiplayer, you don't pick multiplayer,
[16650.60s -> 16652.36s]  you pick not alone?
[16652.84s -> 16653.96s]  Yeah, that is weird.
[16654.68s -> 16658.32s]  It's like they know that we're real gamers.
[16658.32s -> 16659.44s]  Here comes like a storm.
[16659.44s -> 16662.85s]  Why do I say weather looks clear?
[16662.85s -> 16664.21s]  Why do I say weather looks clear?
[16665.01s -> 16666.45s]  I have to keep an eye on those clouds.
[16666.45s -> 16667.49s]  Hey, the weather looks clear.
[16667.49s -> 16669.97s]  It doesn't like a storm come.
[16669.97s -> 16671.49s]  It's getting mighty crowded out here.
[16672.61s -> 16674.16s]  Wait, did we even do the thing?
[16678.50s -> 16679.94s]  Did you do the barbecue yet?
[16681.00s -> 16681.80s]  Did I?
[16681.80s -> 16683.16s]  No, no, I'm just...
[16683.16s -> 16683.88s]  I now have to...
[16686.21s -> 16687.41s]  I'm swimming with the fishes.
[16687.41s -> 16688.29s]  I got no mask on
[16688.29s -> 16690.29s]  and I'm not gonna be pushing any buttons here.
[16691.01s -> 16695.33s]  Where's the boat?
[16695.33s -> 16695.89s]  I just saw it.
[16696.45s -> 16704.07s]  What the fuck is going on?
[16704.07s -> 16704.57s]  Three?
[16713.96s -> 16714.52s]  What happened?
[16715.84s -> 16718.88s]  Did you go make popcorn during the segment where she's drowning?
[16719.44s -> 16722.32s]  Are you doing something here?
[16722.32s -> 16723.84s]  Well, I hope that she was gonna die,
[16723.84s -> 16725.52s]  but no, she's actually fine.
[16727.43s -> 16729.59s]  I have no control over the game right now.
[16729.59s -> 16733.27s]  There were three separate failed QTEs to get out of this pipe,
[16736.58s -> 16737.46s]  which I feel like is...
[16738.26s -> 16738.98s]  I can't get up.
[16743.84s -> 16745.04s]  B doesn't do anything.
[16745.04s -> 16746.32s]  I haven't pressed B.
[16746.32s -> 16746.96s]  What did I do?
[16750.58s -> 16751.38s]  Okay, italics.
[16751.38s -> 16753.54s]  I think you need to like come press QB.
[16753.54s -> 16754.66s]  Do I need to do something?
[16758.37s -> 16759.49s]  Yeah, I'm stuck.
[16759.49s -> 16760.45s]  I'm looking just at the front of the boat.
[16760.45s -> 16761.73s]  I'm going as fast as I can.
[16774.34s -> 16776.10s]  It actually needed to wait for you.
[16777.96s -> 16779.00s]  How dare you talk?
[16780.20s -> 16784.28s]  I was silent last time when I played the real game.
[16787.80s -> 16789.48s]  Don't they come board?
[16789.48s -> 16790.36s]  What's going on here?
[16791.24s -> 16792.68s]  Where's your like boat friends?
[16792.68s -> 16793.64s]  Hello again, little blip.
[16794.52s -> 16796.04s]  What you doing all the way out here?
[16797.24s -> 16806.34s]  They said italics is breaking character.
[16807.88s -> 16809.72s]  I did say something.
[16809.72s -> 16811.16s]  I chose a dialogue option,
[16811.88s -> 16815.92s]  but I was silent when we played the actual game.
[16823.11s -> 16823.83s]  There's nothing here.
[16823.83s -> 16824.87s]  Okay, I'm being a good boy.
[16824.87s -> 16826.95s]  There's nobody here.
[16826.95s -> 16833.36s]  Hey, don't worry about it.
[16833.36s -> 16833.92s]  I'm a people person.
[16833.92s -> 16835.12s]  If you could just pull that open,
[16835.12s -> 16837.28s]  why was I going to shimmy it with a knife?
[16837.28s -> 16838.08s]  Maybe they're fishermen.
[16839.27s -> 16840.15s]  Maybe that's their buoy.
[16841.52s -> 16841.84s]  Maybe...
[16847.12s -> 16847.68s]  Got to chat.
[16853.30s -> 16855.62s]  We won 100%, not 98%.
[16856.58s -> 16857.70s]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[16858.34s -> 16860.26s]  Do they...
[16860.82s -> 16862.50s]  All right, I'm getting ready to break the ship.
[16862.50s -> 16863.54s]  So that should be your cue.
[16864.52s -> 16865.80s]  Okay, you're breaking the ship.
[16867.52s -> 16868.48s]  I'm breaking the plane.
[16869.20s -> 16876.02s]  All right, hold on.
[16876.02s -> 16876.66s]  Don't do it yet.
[16886.61s -> 16888.13s]  Okay, you just did it.
[16888.13s -> 16888.93s]  All right.
[16888.93s -> 16890.21s]  Well, I'm going to zero.
[16890.21s -> 16894.95s]  So they got me.
[16894.95s -> 16895.67s]  What's that about?
[16896.23s -> 16899.48s]  Wait, didn't we just do this?
[16900.28s -> 16902.92s]  I guess I haven't...
[16902.92s -> 16907.01s]  They're like coming right over to it.
[16910.04s -> 16910.84s]  Oh, this...
[16910.84s -> 16911.48s]  I don't think this...
[16913.16s -> 16914.36s]  Did that happen last time?
[16920.68s -> 16921.48s]  They just take off.
[16921.48s -> 16922.36s]  They don't even stop.
[16923.75s -> 16924.79s]  Yeah, this happened last time.
[16924.79s -> 16924.95s]  Yeah.
[16928.64s -> 16930.00s]  I thought I broke the plane.
[16942.37s -> 16942.77s]  20.
[16943.41s -> 16944.29s]  No, make it 30.
[16946.13s -> 16947.01s]  More like 40.
[16952.61s -> 16955.20s]  You know, I think this whole thing could have been
[16955.20s -> 16958.72s]  avoided if you had just handed this person the money.
[16960.71s -> 16962.10s]  You know what I mean?
[16962.10s -> 16965.22s]  Like, hey, come over here and let me hand you the money.
[16965.22s -> 16966.26s]  I guess they didn't need the money.
[16966.90s -> 16968.58s]  That could have been like, hey, I really want to pay for this.
[16968.58s -> 16969.46s]  I'm really like that.
[16969.46s -> 16970.66s]  That was like, yeah, I'm sorry.
[16971.86s -> 16974.13s]  Hello.
[16974.13s -> 16976.50s]  You going a little brain trip there, Flissy?
[16977.22s -> 16979.06s]  Here a piece of work, Conrad.
[16979.06s -> 16979.70s]  I'm not all work.
[16981.48s -> 16982.76s]  Are you trying to flirt with me?
[16983.64s -> 16984.52s]  Is it working?
[16984.52s -> 16985.88s]  I don't even know what it is.
[16986.52s -> 16988.20s]  Well, when you think of something,
[16988.28s -> 16990.20s]  I'll just be over here taking in the view,
[16990.20s -> 16992.28s]  flirting up a storm, hashtag wink.
[16992.28s -> 16992.76s]  All right.
[16992.76s -> 16994.52s]  I have to put a disclaimer on the top of the stream.
[16995.80s -> 16996.76s]  Guys, hold on.
[16997.32s -> 17002.71s]  I didn't do enough in my playthrough to get proposed to this time.
[17002.71s -> 17003.75s]  He doesn't like me anymore.
[17004.39s -> 17015.16s]  Well, I got to write, like, he doesn't like me.
[17015.16s -> 17018.12s]  Somehow it feels worse than saying no to a marriage proposal
[17018.12s -> 17020.12s]  is knowing that they were going to propose,
[17020.12s -> 17023.56s]  but you did something and now they're not going to.
[17024.36s -> 17025.25s]  It feels bad, man.
[17026.84s -> 17027.80s]  This has to be up here.
[17031.46s -> 17034.98s]  Wait, it's going to be one word, not two words.
[17037.46s -> 17038.82s]  It has to be one word.
[17041.30s -> 17042.66s]  This is not.
[17042.66s -> 17043.46s]  Okay, there.
[17043.46s -> 17044.02s]  That's better.
[17044.58s -> 17049.22s]  What are you trying to type?
[17049.22s -> 17050.10s]  I did.
[17050.10s -> 17050.90s]  It's not important.
[17054.32s -> 17055.92s]  By the way, as to the missing text,
[17055.92s -> 17057.92s]  I did have Discord open the entire stream.
[17057.92s -> 17059.60s]  So if you could just typed it, I would have seen.
[17061.22s -> 17063.52s]  Oh, well, I'm fucking stupid.
[17063.52s -> 17064.32s]  Don't worry.
[17064.32s -> 17071.12s]  Okay, I think they're on their way back up.
[17071.12s -> 17072.96s]  And I was getting used to it just being you and me.
[17072.96s -> 17073.84s]  We need to light the grill.
[17073.84s -> 17074.48s]  Oh, pick me.
[17076.08s -> 17077.28s]  Grill Capitan.
[17077.28s -> 17082.00s]  You may light the grill, but I will never call you that.
[17082.00s -> 17082.64s]  Here we go.
[17088.76s -> 17089.24s]  Let's see.
[17090.68s -> 17092.36s]  Oh, I have to make a decision this time.
[17098.13s -> 17098.69s]  You have to go.
[17100.39s -> 17101.75s]  I have to make a choice to try to kill.
[17106.21s -> 17106.93s]  Yeah, of course.
[17112.61s -> 17113.97s]  Damn, I'm sorry.
[17116.15s -> 17118.07s]  So what's the easiest way to kill anybody?
[17118.07s -> 17119.75s]  Why is it just looking sad at him?
[17122.32s -> 17123.12s]  Nothing happened.
[17124.36s -> 17126.04s]  Okay, fail every quick time event.
[17126.04s -> 17127.64s]  This is where it happens.
[17129.48s -> 17130.52s]  Have you not been doing that?
[17131.24s -> 17132.36s]  I've only gotten one chance.
[17133.64s -> 17146.02s]  Why was there only one explosion?
[17146.02s -> 17148.42s]  I just had a little trouble firing up the grill.
[17149.22s -> 17159.16s]  Conrad?
[17159.16s -> 17159.64s]  Whatever.
[17159.64s -> 17161.24s]  It's like they're seeing shit.
[17161.24s -> 17163.72s]  They say a sentence and then they like just get lost.
[17163.72s -> 17165.96s]  Like super, like in their own head.
[17166.92s -> 17170.76s]  Yeah, it's like, unfortunately, we did not leave it as pristine.
[17170.76s -> 17171.80s]  My great aunt.
[17171.80s -> 17172.04s]  What?
[17172.76s -> 17173.80s]  What's wrong with you?
[17173.80s -> 17174.52s]  With dementia.
[17175.40s -> 17178.44s]  Oh, that's a cool looking thing up in the sky.
[17179.00s -> 17181.24s]  There's no cockpit anymore for starters.
[17181.24s -> 17182.92s]  Well, that's just fucking perfect.
[17189.65s -> 17190.05s]  All right.
[17190.85s -> 17191.41s]  It's time.
[17192.53s -> 17194.69s]  No, everybody survived.
[17194.69s -> 17195.81s]  Weirdly enough.
[17195.81s -> 17198.77s]  I don't know how it's possible when it's not possible.
[17198.77s -> 17199.65s]  Got you a wink.
[17203.19s -> 17204.87s]  Yeah, I noticed you haven't been saying anything.
[17204.87s -> 17207.35s]  There's no these intrepid adventurers then.
[17207.43s -> 17211.35s]  Alex and his little brother Brad trying to swim with the big fish.
[17212.23s -> 17214.39s]  Both seem out of their debt.
[17215.27s -> 17216.00s]  He just looked down.
[17216.00s -> 17217.44s]  That was a scripted line.
[17217.44s -> 17218.80s]  He read that.
[17218.80s -> 17220.08s]  His script is in the book.
[17220.08s -> 17221.36s]  And he the love of hers.
[17222.00s -> 17223.52s]  That was a really good line.
[17223.52s -> 17224.48s]  He didn't write.
[17224.48s -> 17226.08s]  A bold fellow, you might say.
[17227.12s -> 17229.68s]  Or maybe you'd say arrogant.
[17229.68s -> 17236.04s]  And there's Captain Fliss, strong, forthright, stubborn.
[17237.00s -> 17241.56s]  She appears somewhat immune to Conrad's charms.
[17241.56s -> 17242.60s]  So far, at least.
[17243.64s -> 17245.89s]  Let me reassure you.
[17245.89s -> 17248.13s]  Let's get his head to make some decisions.
[17248.13s -> 17249.57s]  They'll value later on.
[17250.77s -> 17254.53s]  And so I failed to stream cutie and regret zero.
[17254.53s -> 17254.85s]  Really?
[17255.81s -> 17257.41s]  It hasn't happened to me since the last time.
[17259.59s -> 17260.95s]  Well, but we're not on the same server, though.
[17260.95s -> 17261.91s]  You're going somewhere else, right?
[17262.47s -> 17272.88s]  Well, preserved was the plane.
[17272.88s -> 17274.24s]  Pretty much what you'd expect.
[17274.40s -> 17275.52s]  Oh, we get the beers.
[17275.52s -> 17276.00s]  It was insane.
[17276.00s -> 17277.52s]  It was like traveling through time.
[17277.52s -> 17278.00s]  No shit.
[17278.00s -> 17278.24s]  Hold on.
[17279.12s -> 17280.72s]  I'm gonna change it again.
[17280.72s -> 17284.00s]  We get the beers and we sit around and we do a beer thing.
[17291.94s -> 17292.66s]  Brewskis.
[17300.08s -> 17300.40s]  Action.
[17303.67s -> 17304.95s]  Silent, scary story.
[17304.95s -> 17305.45s]  Incoming.
[17310.37s -> 17313.89s]  Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension
[17313.89s -> 17318.05s]  where the past is underwater and everything is covered in barnacles and sharks.
[17318.05s -> 17318.77s]  Sharks?
[17318.77s -> 17319.73s]  It was a gray reef.
[17320.85s -> 17322.93s]  Hey, I thought it was pretty intense.
[17323.01s -> 17325.97s]  Wasn't Conrad going to get us some more beers after he helped Fliss?
[17326.93s -> 17329.17s]  Maybe he decided, hey, I'll drink some.
[17329.17s -> 17330.45s]  And then he got drunk.
[17330.45s -> 17332.77s]  And since he was drunk, he forgot to bring it to us.
[17332.77s -> 17334.77s]  And he just kept on drinking and he drank all of it.
[17334.77s -> 17336.53s]  I can't wait to hear your scary story.
[17336.53s -> 17337.65s]  This kind of phenomenon.
[17337.65s -> 17339.09s]  Oh, that's right.
[17339.09s -> 17340.37s]  I'll go look for him.
[17340.37s -> 17342.13s]  I didn't even I forgot about that.
[17343.33s -> 17345.25s]  That's going to be a terrible story.
[17345.81s -> 17346.85s]  It's going to be a good one.
[17346.85s -> 17347.35s]  Yeah.
[17352.16s -> 17352.66s]  You're right.
[17355.72s -> 17358.47s]  So which one is?
[17358.47s -> 17359.03s]  Oh, God.
[17359.03s -> 17360.07s]  What's going on?
[17360.07s -> 17361.75s]  You know, where the magic.
[17361.75s -> 17363.83s]  This is giving me secondhand anxiety.
[17364.71s -> 17374.92s]  OK, that's enough of that.
[17374.92s -> 17375.80s]  You get them beers?
[17376.36s -> 17377.56s]  Oh, yeah, the beers.
[17378.44s -> 17379.32s]  I was just getting them now.
[17382.60s -> 17384.76s]  Why is it so much better like this?
[17385.80s -> 17387.00s]  It's not working.
[17387.00s -> 17395.94s]  This game becomes like a letter grade higher with the do nothing road.
[17399.40s -> 17399.90s]  Yeah.
[17400.36s -> 17403.08s]  Now that everybody's here, let's take a look at the navigators.
[17403.08s -> 17405.24s]  Boyfriend was trying to understand my inner thought.
[17406.12s -> 17406.84s]  Where did you put it?
[17406.84s -> 17407.64s]  It's in your case.
[17407.64s -> 17408.92s]  OK, I'll go get it.
[17408.92s -> 17410.36s]  If I say he did not find them.
[17411.40s -> 17415.94s]  You got the map pad dive master?
[17415.94s -> 17416.50s]  Yeah, I got it.
[17416.50s -> 17417.46s]  I have to know guys.
[17417.46s -> 17421.70s]  I have to say that I'm going to talk because I have to tell the story.
[17422.26s -> 17422.88s]  All right.
[17422.88s -> 17426.88s]  I'm just going to like stop here because you done again as well.
[17426.88s -> 17427.38s]  Yeah.
[17427.92s -> 17428.42s]  What?
[17429.68s -> 17432.88s]  Julia, I'm just trying to have a type web server.
[17432.88s -> 17434.56s]  You're on mind to me in this court.
[17435.60s -> 17436.16s]  Oh, shit.
[17437.99s -> 17438.87s]  Oh, my God.
[17438.87s -> 17439.51s]  Fine.
[17439.51s -> 17441.40s]  Let's go and get the pad together then.
[17442.44s -> 17443.32s]  Keep saying nothing.
[17451.73s -> 17453.09s]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[17458.16s -> 17458.64s]  Fine.
[17458.64s -> 17459.52s]  We'll go with the pad.
[17459.52s -> 17461.12s]  Wait, did I just ruin everything?
[17462.47s -> 17464.39s]  I think that's what I was originally on.
[17465.03s -> 17469.00s]  Because, well, I went down to zero like twice.
[17470.04s -> 17472.93s]  Maybe that server is doing better now.
[17472.93s -> 17474.69s]  I don't know.
[17474.69s -> 17475.19s]  OK.
[17475.19s -> 17480.20s]  And action in three, two, one.
[17482.96s -> 17483.68s]  Let's go.
[17483.68s -> 17484.18s]  Go.
[17484.56s -> 17485.68s]  DDoS, go away.
[17486.32s -> 17491.60s]  Wait, I don't tell the story.
[17491.60s -> 17492.64s]  It doesn't matter for Brace and Lee.
[17493.81s -> 17494.93s]  You got a girlfriend?
[17494.93s -> 17502.20s]  I'm going to guess that's a no.
[17503.56s -> 17504.84s]  Dudes make too big a deal.
[17504.84s -> 17505.08s]  All right.
[17505.08s -> 17507.00s]  I have to say I will tell a story.
[17507.00s -> 17508.20s]  What's the big deal about girls?
[17508.76s -> 17509.24s]  Right here.
[17509.96s -> 17510.46s]  What?
[17519.84s -> 17521.84s]  This is, this is just.
[17521.84s -> 17522.34s]  Here it comes.
[17523.48s -> 17524.44s]  Here comes the story.
[17525.00s -> 17525.88s]  Hello there, sailor.
[17526.76s -> 17527.64s]  Excuse me?
[17527.64s -> 17528.14s]  Careful.
[17528.68s -> 17531.24s]  If you did decompress too fast, then you should go easy on me.
[17531.24s -> 17532.20s]  Oh, that actually happened.
[17532.20s -> 17532.92s]  My choice matters.
[17532.92s -> 17534.84s]  I think if I got the bends, I would know by now.
[17535.80s -> 17536.44s]  Not always.
[17537.24s -> 17539.64s]  Sometimes the bends can be super delayed.
[17539.64s -> 17541.80s]  It could be hours or a day or two.
[17541.80s -> 17542.30s]  The bends?
[17543.00s -> 17543.50s]  Yeah.
[17543.50s -> 17546.04s]  It's when you come up from a dive too fast.
[17546.04s -> 17547.16s]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[17547.16s -> 17548.60s]  A decompression sickness.
[17549.16s -> 17549.66s]  Nerd.
[17550.28s -> 17552.52s]  Little nitrogen bubbles that get stuck in your bloodstream.
[17552.52s -> 17553.72s]  Hurts like a bitch.
[17553.72s -> 17554.92s]  It's really serious.
[17554.92s -> 17557.32s]  Divers get sick and die from decompression sickness every year.
[17557.32s -> 17560.12s]  And that is why the good Dr. Conrad says drink them if you got them.
[17560.12s -> 17563.32s]  Because either you're fine or you're going to want a little something to ease the pain.
[17563.32s -> 17563.82s]  Julia.
[17564.36s -> 17566.52s]  I'm telling you not to drink any alcohol right now.
[17566.52s -> 17567.02s]  Oh, come on.
[17567.64s -> 17571.24s]  Telling you take orders from this guy just drink a beer.
[17571.24s -> 17571.74s]  Oh.
[17578.87s -> 17579.99s]  Take that as a no then.
[17580.63s -> 17581.35s]  That was long.
[17582.63s -> 17583.99s]  That became really sad.
[17583.99s -> 17585.43s]  Yeah, that was just like, whoa.
[17586.31s -> 17587.99s]  Who wants to find some sunken treasure?
[17589.03s -> 17590.28s]  So what do you think, Adam?
[17590.92s -> 17591.42s]  Coordinates?
[17592.04s -> 17593.72s]  Those are coordinates, all right.
[17593.72s -> 17595.40s]  Maybe the plane's destination?
[17595.40s -> 17596.76s]  You think we could get there by tomorrow?
[17597.32s -> 17599.96s]  It takes a couple hours if the weather stays steady.
[17599.96s -> 17600.60s]  Wow.
[17600.60s -> 17601.32s]  You find anything else?
[17601.32s -> 17602.52s]  I've got a story for you.
[17603.80s -> 17604.44s]  Reckless.
[17604.44s -> 17605.32s]  All of you.
[17605.32s -> 17606.12s]  Excuse me?
[17606.12s -> 17608.52s]  I told you to leave everything down there alone.
[17608.52s -> 17609.16s]  Oh, come on.
[17609.16s -> 17610.36s]  We've been through this already.
[17610.36s -> 17611.64s]  I'm not talking about the low.
[17617.86s -> 17619.99s]  Well, don't everyone talk at once?
[17620.95s -> 17628.37s]  What does it even matter?
[17628.37s -> 17631.81s]  We should have never gone down to that plane in the first place.
[17631.81s -> 17633.01s]  It's bad luck.
[17633.01s -> 17635.49s]  You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference.
[17635.49s -> 17637.97s]  But every single thing you bring back has an essence.
[17637.97s -> 17639.01s]  I can hear that.
[17639.01s -> 17640.21s]  It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.
[17640.21s -> 17640.77s]  Here we go.
[17641.41s -> 17642.69s]  I can hear what she's saying.
[17642.69s -> 17643.33s]  I've never thought about it like that.
[17643.33s -> 17644.69s]  You never think about much of anything.
[17644.69s -> 17647.09s]  Well, maybe I never heard about such cool ghost stories.
[17647.09s -> 17649.41s]  They're not cool ghost stories.
[17649.41s -> 17650.37s]  Not like for fun.
[17651.25s -> 17654.53s]  People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.
[17654.53s -> 17655.25s]  Damn straight.
[17656.21s -> 17658.37s]  Fred, you got a fun ghost story, right?
[17658.37s -> 17658.87s]  I do.
[17660.18s -> 17660.98s]  That is now...
[17660.98s -> 17661.30s]  Now that...
[17661.30s -> 17663.30s]  You have to say yes and then...
[17663.30s -> 17666.50s]  Yeah, I heard a story that happened right around here, too.
[17666.50s -> 17667.38s]  Let's hear it.
[17667.38s -> 17667.86s]  Let's hear it.
[17667.86s -> 17668.98s]  I'll use a good show.
[17669.94s -> 17679.67s]  Let's get away a little, bro.
[17679.67s -> 17680.17s]  Okay.
[17680.63s -> 17681.19s]  Here goes.
[17681.99s -> 17683.43s]  This story is true.
[17683.43s -> 17686.55s]  It had happened right near here in an old lighthouse.
[17686.55s -> 17687.51s]  A classic setup.
[17687.51s -> 17688.71s]  In an old lighthouse.
[17688.71s -> 17689.75s]  True story?
[17689.75s -> 17690.47s]  Where'd you hear this?
[17697.24s -> 17698.12s]  Come on now.
[17698.12s -> 17698.52s]  Brad.
[17698.52s -> 17699.56s]  Reveal your sources.
[17699.56s -> 17700.12s]  Brad, you all right?
[17700.12s -> 17704.60s]  In a lighthouse stood atop in a toll isolated from the rest of the world.
[17704.60s -> 17706.20s]  A lone beacon in the night.
[17706.20s -> 17707.40s]  A sailor's respite.
[17708.20s -> 17710.20s]  The lighthouse keeper would hear the waves.
[17710.20s -> 17711.64s]  Are you telling this story?
[17712.12s -> 17712.84s]  It's doing it on...
[17712.84s -> 17713.72s]  It's doing it on...
[17713.72s -> 17715.00s]  I can't control it.
[17715.00s -> 17716.44s]  Covered in blood.
[17716.44s -> 17717.56s]  She's stumbling down the beach.
[17718.12s -> 17721.32s]  He hurries to her aid and she falls into his arms, sobbing.
[17721.32s -> 17724.68s]  As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.
[17724.68s -> 17726.28s]  He doesn't waste any time.
[17726.28s -> 17726.78s]  Smooth.
[17728.12s -> 17731.75s]  She just did a gym from the office.
[17732.39s -> 17736.07s]  The woman answers.
[17736.07s -> 17736.55s]  We got it.
[17736.55s -> 17737.43s]  We finally got one.
[17737.43s -> 17738.07s]  In the lighthouse.
[17738.71s -> 17740.31s]  My parents are upstairs right now.
[17740.31s -> 17741.19s]  Twists.
[17741.19s -> 17744.15s]  Of course, the lighthouse keeper says, that isn't so.
[17744.15s -> 17745.83s]  Of course, he's lived there alone for years.
[17746.47s -> 17750.07s]  The woman becomes hysterical, and his sister parents are upstairs.
[17750.07s -> 17754.47s]  So, they go to the top of the lighthouse, and there, splayed out on the floor,
[17754.47s -> 17757.67s]  is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.
[17757.67s -> 17758.79s]  Always an axe.
[17758.79s -> 17760.63s]  I mean, do people even use axes anymore?
[17765.78s -> 17767.14s]  Do they, Brad?
[17767.14s -> 17768.10s]  Okay.
[17768.10s -> 17769.54s]  We're sticking with axes.
[17770.90s -> 17773.06s]  He's pissed that you interrupted his story.
[17773.94s -> 17774.74s]  Just let him talk.
[17775.62s -> 17777.54s]  Another fourth wall break from YouTube.
[17778.58s -> 17779.54s]  That's so funny.
[17780.18s -> 17780.68s]  Who did it?
[17788.82s -> 17791.06s]  He doesn't want to finish the story anymore.
[17791.70s -> 17792.98s]  Because you interrupted him.
[17792.98s -> 17794.18s]  He's gotta be the woman's husband, right?
[17794.18s -> 17796.50s]  So, the lighthouse keeper creeps over to the closet.
[17797.30s -> 17798.58s]  Opens the door.
[17798.58s -> 17801.54s]  And, sure enough, there's a man inside.
[17802.42s -> 17804.58s]  But he's cut his own throat.
[17805.38s -> 17806.64s]  Horrified.
[17806.64s -> 17809.12s]  He looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.
[17809.84s -> 17810.40s]  Closer.
[17811.36s -> 17811.86s]  Closer.
[17812.88s -> 17816.08s]  And he sees it's his own face.
[17817.12s -> 17819.20s]  And then it's eyes bulge out and screams.
[17822.53s -> 17823.03s]  So gross.
[17824.21s -> 17825.01s]  Super twist.
[17825.01s -> 17825.51s]  Nice.
[17828.31s -> 17829.27s]  Nice one, Squire.
[17829.99s -> 17838.07s]  I think he told a better last time.
[17838.07s -> 17841.43s]  She's just fuming about being told not to drink that beer.
[17841.43s -> 17843.35s]  She's very aware of the camera, too.
[17843.35s -> 17843.85s]  I love it.
[17844.79s -> 17847.59s]  She keeps doing the blink right, look right into the camera.
[17847.59s -> 17848.31s]  No, no, no, no.
[17848.31s -> 17851.11s]  Because according to standard vessel regulation, we're all required
[17851.11s -> 17852.87s]  one more beer before hitting the hay.
[17852.87s -> 17854.23s]  I love that so much.
[17854.87s -> 17860.07s]  It's standard issue regulatory institutional protocol subdivision 1099.
[17860.07s -> 17860.57s]  See this.
[17861.11s -> 17862.31s]  Where'd you read that?
[17862.31s -> 17862.79s]  The internet.
[17862.79s -> 17865.99s]  Oh, so you found a website that tells you to drink beer under every circumstance.
[17865.99s -> 17867.59s]  I'm just following orders, man.
[17867.59s -> 17868.79s]  I'm into this website.
[17868.79s -> 17869.91s]  10-4, good buddy.
[17869.91s -> 17870.63s]  And I'm out.
[17871.91s -> 17872.41s]  Okay.
[17873.35s -> 17874.71s]  This is where it goes to shit.
[17875.51s -> 17880.80s]  Here they come.
[17882.00s -> 17884.40s]  Here come the failable QTEs.
[17886.52s -> 17888.04s]  And rapid fires, et cetera.
[17888.68s -> 17895.43s]  I feel like I wouldn't be sleeping that well
[17895.43s -> 17898.15s]  on a boat in the middle of the ocean during the storm.
[17898.15s -> 17898.79s]  No, no way.
[17900.55s -> 17906.37s]  How would you sleep through that?
[17906.37s -> 17907.89s]  They look like they're sleeping so soundly.
[17909.65s -> 17911.49s]  I'm telling you, man, I don't know about you,
[17911.49s -> 17915.57s]  but if I hear even the handle of the door of my bedroom turn in half an inch,
[17915.57s -> 17917.57s]  I'm up ready for battle every time.
[17918.29s -> 17919.89s]  Yeah, I hear that and I get up.
[17919.89s -> 17920.39s]  I'm ready.
[17921.25s -> 17922.90s]  I mean, you can only hear it sometime.
[17924.95s -> 17925.75s]  No, you got to be ready.
[17934.28s -> 17937.00s]  Shit.
[17938.96s -> 17940.08s]  That's how you get woken up.
[17940.96s -> 17949.67s]  I didn't fight this time.
[17951.96s -> 17953.80s]  These people's entire motivation is money.
[17953.80s -> 17956.44s]  What was the conversation that you had on top of the boat?
[17957.08s -> 17960.08s]  I don't even remember, but don't take off anything.
[17962.52s -> 17965.56s]  What was the conversation these people had when they rolled up next to you?
[17966.28s -> 17969.80s]  Oh, they run into the buoy and then they go,
[17969.80s -> 17971.32s]  you bro, you damaged our boat.
[17972.29s -> 17974.77s]  And you can be like, oh, here's some money.
[17974.85s -> 17976.45s]  Conrad starts to be like, here's some money.
[17976.45s -> 17977.25s]  Here's 10 bucks.
[17977.25s -> 17978.61s]  Here's 20 bucks, loser.
[17979.57s -> 17980.45s]  And then they drive off.
[17984.42s -> 17986.82s]  They've run into like a fishing line thing, whatever it is.
[17988.88s -> 17990.48s]  So they're looking for money.
[17991.46s -> 17996.42s]  Well, no, they're just like fishermen that are just driving along
[17996.42s -> 17997.86s]  and they've run into our shit.
[17998.95s -> 18000.47s]  I'm not un-gagging anybody.
[18008.08s -> 18009.68s]  It's giving me an opportunity to do it again.
[18010.40s -> 18015.99s]  I'm not un-gagging anybody.
[18018.92s -> 18021.00s]  We're just going to sit here, be good,
[18021.64s -> 18023.32s]  and then we'll never have to go down to the ship.
[18023.88s -> 18025.80s]  Yeah, we're like just following the orders.
[18027.00s -> 18028.12s]  We didn't do anything wrong.
[18039.20s -> 18040.88s]  Everybody's still taped.
[18041.84s -> 18044.24s]  We're not going to be able to communicate on the top of the boat.
[18046.74s -> 18047.38s]  Oh, what?
[18048.26s -> 18055.40s]  You could have done that the whole time.
[18056.20s -> 18057.60s]  Yeah, why would I take you, love?
[18057.60s -> 18059.12s]  We've been down here for like three hours.
[18059.12s -> 18061.04s]  You couldn't just get this tape off my face?
[18061.60s -> 18064.85s]  Wow, anybody could have done that for anybody.
[18065.01s -> 18065.81s]  Why's it got to be me?
[18073.16s -> 18076.20s]  He's like, I liked you better yesterday when you weren't even talking.
[18079.20s -> 18081.44s]  Hey, so good news, bad news.
[18081.44s -> 18082.40s]  Bad news?
[18082.40s -> 18083.68s]  I don't see how this could get any worse.
[18083.68s -> 18084.32s]  So what are we going to do here?
[18084.32s -> 18087.84s]  Bad news is these are kind of maybe the fishermen I missed off earlier.
[18087.84s -> 18089.44s]  Oh, god damn it, Conrad.
[18089.44s -> 18090.88s]  Great, just great.
[18090.88s -> 18091.52s]  And the good news?
[18092.24s -> 18093.44s]  I recognize them.
[18093.44s -> 18094.40s]  How was that good news?
[18094.40s -> 18096.16s]  I thought you were going to ask the good news first.
[18096.16s -> 18097.68s]  You're such an idiot, Jesus.
[18109.43s -> 18109.99s]  Choose well.
[18113.73s -> 18114.13s]  I am.
[18115.73s -> 18127.11s]  He's just, he's just stares at him.
[18127.99s -> 18129.99s]  Nobody knows you're out here, little lady.
[18130.63s -> 18131.99s]  You're all alone with us now.
[18133.35s -> 18134.71s]  Let's make the move, son.
[18134.71s -> 18137.27s]  You can go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
[18139.11s -> 18140.39s]  I couldn't get out.
[18140.39s -> 18141.51s]  We didn't do the escape thing.
[18143.27s -> 18147.22s]  We're not even going to make an attempt.
[18147.22s -> 18147.46s]  No.
[18148.10s -> 18162.55s]  What's happening here?
[18163.27s -> 18165.59s]  I feel like I should talk here and just talk a ton of shit.
[18166.55s -> 18187.68s]  Try to talk about easy.
[18188.40s -> 18191.68s]  Fuck you.
[18192.40s -> 18193.36s]  I'm gonna kill you.
[18207.35s -> 18210.55s]  The one time I talked, I had to antagonize to make sure I got hurt.
[18212.96s -> 18215.44s]  Oh, yeah, I guess we do have to say something sometimes.
[18217.72s -> 18219.51s]  So we're not going to do anything.
[18220.63s -> 18221.67s]  And she's going to just break.
[18223.12s -> 18224.64s]  Unless it's an aggressive option.
[18226.74s -> 18228.50s]  Only aggressive options may be picked.
[18229.22s -> 18230.58s]  Yeah, aggressive only.
[18234.61s -> 18241.32s]  Oh, Jesus, Conrad.
[18242.88s -> 18243.44s]  They got me.
[18244.80s -> 18246.08s]  Punched him right in the eye.
[18246.80s -> 18248.37s]  Why didn't you tell me?
[18248.37s -> 18250.32s]  Well, this just happened.
[18251.12s -> 18254.64s]  No, but she was in here asking me what was happening and I didn't respond.
[18256.24s -> 18261.64s]  Deep stick.
[18262.92s -> 18263.96s]  Shut the fuck up.
[18264.52s -> 18268.29s]  I don't think they're gonna hit her.
[18268.85s -> 18270.04s]  They haven't hit Fliz.
[18271.76s -> 18280.10s]  Very chivalrous pirates.
[18280.10s -> 18283.14s]  Well, the climax of the story is coming up right now.
[18286.42s -> 18289.96s]  Hey, Tiny, or are you just taking in the scenery?
[18293.30s -> 18298.00s]  We have to get them to the next part.
[18298.00s -> 18298.72s]  There's no way.
[18298.72s -> 18300.72s]  He always gets lost in his own mind.
[18300.72s -> 18303.76s]  Once we get Julia back, maybe we can take it to my surprise.
[18304.88s -> 18308.32s]  Okay, so we're going to be violent here?
[18308.32s -> 18309.36s]  We're going to be violent here, I guess.
[18317.12s -> 18325.92s]  Yeah, just absolutely reckless.
[18335.27s -> 18336.15s]  I got the scissors.
[18337.11s -> 18339.51s]  I'm gonna stab that guy when he comes in from the door.
[18340.39s -> 18343.51s]  We just have to wait and see what they want to do with us.
[18360.85s -> 18362.29s]  So what's the plan here?
[18363.41s -> 18364.21s]  We already failed this.
[18364.21s -> 18365.33s]  Yeah, we failed this already.
[18366.93s -> 18368.69s]  We may as well, like, actually do this one.
[18369.49s -> 18370.45s]  Yeah, it's a speedboat.
[18372.55s -> 18373.51s]  He's got a gun.
[18373.51s -> 18376.92s]  I have to be reckless.
[18376.92s -> 18379.32s]  If you can clear the cards right, we can catch him by surprise.
[18379.32s -> 18379.80s]  Take him out.
[18386.13s -> 18387.49s]  I think I've seen some shit.
[18387.49s -> 18388.05s]  What do you think?
[18389.09s -> 18389.81s]  Seven seconds.
[18390.53s -> 18391.73s]  I can get out through the window.
[18391.73s -> 18392.85s]  We got to break these off first.
[18392.85s -> 18395.41s]  I hope I can fall off the fucking side of them.
[18396.93s -> 18397.41s]  Good call.
[18400.77s -> 18402.53s]  Here, I'll climb out this window.
[18402.53s -> 18403.41s]  Take a look around.
[18403.41s -> 18404.21s]  Just scope it out.
[18404.21s -> 18406.53s]  You guys distract them so they don't see me sneaking.
[18410.96s -> 18413.52s]  But if we fail, then they come in and we can fight them.
[18413.52s -> 18414.88s]  So which one's better?
[18414.88s -> 18416.96s]  Yeah, definitely fail so we can be aggressive.
[18416.96s -> 18432.18s]  Three, two, I'm sorry.
[18432.18s -> 18433.30s]  I got really, I panicked.
[18434.18s -> 18435.64s]  I got really into it.
[18436.60s -> 18437.32s]  Oh, my God.
[18438.04s -> 18440.10s]  I tried to use left thumb stick.
[18450.98s -> 18452.26s]  Wait, how did we get into this?
[18452.26s -> 18453.06s]  Stupid.
[18453.06s -> 18454.55s]  It's the same situation.
[18454.55s -> 18455.43s]  It's the same situation.
[18457.27s -> 18459.27s]  No, no, no, no, you're the hostage now.
[18461.56s -> 18462.06s]  What?
[18462.06s -> 18465.91s]  Brad's down.
[18469.86s -> 18472.34s]  Did Brad get down by running into that guy?
[18472.34s -> 18475.22s]  I don't, why don't we get to see what's going on in the boat?
[18477.94s -> 18478.98s]  Wait, where are you?
[18478.98s -> 18479.70s]  I'm on the ground.
[18481.21s -> 18483.35s]  Oh, I see.
[18488.31s -> 18489.19s]  Go for it.
[18489.19s -> 18496.38s]  Oh, shit.
[18503.18s -> 18504.70s]  Shooting down in a boat.
[18505.42s -> 18506.16s]  Smart.
[18511.03s -> 18511.99s]  Dude, nothing.
[18513.35s -> 18514.55s]  The flag's there.
[18515.19s -> 18517.27s]  Can you stab him?
[18540.78s -> 18541.66s]  Get off our boat.
[18559.78s -> 18561.06s]  Is it the same timeline?
[18577.43s -> 18580.55s]  The way to get Conrad killed is you have to, I have to try to escape.
[18591.88s -> 18602.46s]  Yeah, maybe we can sell some of these plates or cups.
[18604.38s -> 18605.82s]  I found the gold.
[18615.72s -> 18618.20s]  Which one of you is going to tell me about this?
[18619.64s -> 18621.00s]  Manchurian goo.
[18628.66s -> 18629.46s]  I don't think so.
[18631.30s -> 18642.63s]  All right, make a break, boy.
[18644.63s -> 18646.95s]  Anything to like it, to try to get yourself hurt.
[18646.95s -> 18647.91s]  We're gonna be fine, JJ.
[18648.87s -> 18666.65s]  Ah, could we have been so stupid?
[18667.53s -> 18668.73s]  We're lucky it's not worth.
[18670.33s -> 18671.13s]  Could have been killed.
[18671.93s -> 18674.22s]  What were you thinking?
[18675.78s -> 18677.38s]  I, never mind.
[18678.18s -> 18683.21s]  That's it?
[18683.21s -> 18684.33s]  That's all you fucking thought?
[18684.33s -> 18686.97s]  All right, shut the fuck up.
[18688.25s -> 18692.06s]  What do you got?
[18693.53s -> 18694.73s]  You know what I like from you?
[18695.69s -> 18696.19s]  Nothing.
[18697.53s -> 18698.03s]  That's right.
[18698.73s -> 18699.23s]  Nada.
[18699.93s -> 18701.69s]  Complete fucking silence.
[18702.87s -> 18703.35s]  Get it?
[18703.35s -> 18704.47s]  By the way, I love this stream.
[18707.11s -> 18707.91s]  Don't say anything.
[18709.37s -> 18710.09s]  You ruined it.
[18710.09s -> 18710.89s]  You're gonna ruin it.
[18714.34s -> 18715.14s]  I didn't say anything.
[18716.10s -> 18716.82s]  I'm being chat.
[18716.82s -> 18717.32s]  He's chat.
[18719.45s -> 18720.65s]  Oh, I see you're being chat.
[18727.19s -> 18731.19s]  You know what I don't, okay, if you have a game that has like,
[18731.19s -> 18733.91s]  be careful you can die and QTEs are in the game,
[18733.91s -> 18735.59s]  but the QTEs don't do anything.
[18736.15s -> 18738.15s]  What's the point of having them in the first place?
[18738.15s -> 18739.03s]  They don't do anything.
[18739.99s -> 18744.15s]  They just do, but only like, up to four times.
[18747.06s -> 18748.18s]  So are they like three?
[18749.22s -> 18751.06s]  FYI, it's gonna be a long countdown.
[18752.98s -> 18756.82s]  Like I have a choice to make and it's ticking down as slow as possible.
[18756.82s -> 18757.32s]  Oh.
[18758.42s -> 18763.24s]  So we're gonna be here for at least another like,
[18763.24s -> 18764.52s]  maybe hundred and twenty seconds.
[18764.52s -> 18765.56s]  Requesting weather update.
[18765.56s -> 18766.06s]  That's all right.
[18767.16s -> 18767.66s]  Over.
[18768.60s -> 18770.23s]  But I know what you're saying, like,
[18771.19s -> 18773.75s]  that's why I actually liked Detroit Become Human,
[18773.75s -> 18776.63s]  because at least, whatever you thought about the story,
[18777.27s -> 18780.71s]  you actually, like, I lost half the cast in the game.
[18782.07s -> 18782.87s]  Trying not to.
[18784.47s -> 18787.94s]  We did so bad the first run,
[18787.94s -> 18790.82s]  and everyone was fine up until the very final cutscene.
[18792.10s -> 18793.62s]  I mean, it's actually the supreme help.
[18799.13s -> 18800.17s]  He wasn't gonna kill me.
[18801.56s -> 18803.56s]  Everything's better when we have each other.
[18803.56s -> 18806.60s]  There's the classic frying pan moment from earlier.
[18810.20s -> 18811.40s]  Pan joke again.
[18812.60s -> 18840.01s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna help this time,
[18840.01s -> 18841.21s]  because I held on last time.
[18844.79s -> 18845.99s]  What the fuck was that?
[18845.99s -> 18846.63s]  Where are you?
[18846.63s -> 18848.73s]  You have to call out.
[18848.73s -> 18850.76s]  Hey, move it.
[18852.58s -> 18853.08s]  Now.
[18853.86s -> 18856.25s]  Yeah, I don't think I did enough.
[18856.25s -> 18857.37s]  I didn't help either person.
[18857.37s -> 18859.29s]  It was a telltale like, who are you gonna help?
[18859.29s -> 18862.89s]  I think, I figured if I ran, I figured if I ran to help.
[18864.17s -> 18869.34s]  I, I, my mind clouded over, I, I blinked.
[18869.34s -> 18870.63s]  At least you tried.
[18872.79s -> 18875.19s]  I thought if I ran, that the bump was gonna hit a bump,
[18875.19s -> 18876.31s]  and it was gonna fuck me up.
[18877.19s -> 18888.49s]  How did we find this while the ship is sinking?
[18913.77s -> 18915.61s]  At this point, we're basically like,
[18915.61s -> 18918.09s]  the hit new summer blockbuster movie,
[18918.09s -> 18920.25s]  but this is the second evening showing
[18920.25s -> 18923.61s]  where the projector boy fell asleep in the upstairs loft.
[18923.61s -> 18925.05s]  Things could have been quite different.
[18925.05s -> 18927.45s]  We didn't speak, and we did everything wrong.
[18928.41s -> 18939.46s]  Kind-hearted creature I am,
[18939.46s -> 18941.86s]  I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's down.
[18941.86s -> 18943.30s]  Let's hear what he's gotta say.
[18943.30s -> 18944.50s]  Yeah, we could, let's get some tips.
[18945.70s -> 18947.03s]  It's a good idea.
[18949.19s -> 18949.83s]  Uh, yeah.
[18951.59s -> 18953.99s]  Okay, you're in agreement.
[18954.79s -> 18956.31s]  Clue, it is.
[18957.11s -> 18961.35s]  The merchant of Venice, act two, scene seven.
[18961.35s -> 18965.67s]  The prince of Morocco pulls a scroll from the eye of a skull
[18965.83s -> 18969.99s]  and reads, all that glisters is not gold.
[18970.63s -> 18972.87s]  Often have you heard that told?
[18976.50s -> 18979.46s]  Anyway, now that you've reached a point of significance,
[18981.70s -> 18984.58s]  I presume you're eager to get back to your story.
[18984.58s -> 18985.62s]  But here's a thing.
[18986.98s -> 18990.50s]  Everything may not be entirely as it seems.
[18991.30s -> 18992.66s]  Here's another weird-
[18992.66s -> 18994.18s]  That's when I figured out the whole game.
[18995.06s -> 18998.34s]  But, but what's, what, why is this guy in the fucking game?
[18998.34s -> 18999.94s]  Nobody shouldn't have said that.
[18999.94s -> 19000.66s]  Yeah, you know what I mean?
[19000.66s -> 19001.06s]  Like what-
[19001.06s -> 19006.02s]  He's supposed to be like the guy through all the anthology games.
[19006.02s -> 19009.70s]  And maybe they've got an idea where so many games down the road,
[19010.34s -> 19014.10s]  you actually either play as him or play with him as an antagonist.
[19015.70s -> 19020.66s]  So he's like, hey, you're getting to know like the eventual episode seven villain.
[19021.54s -> 19027.38s]  Cause everybody loved Peter Storm Aaron until dawn,
[19027.38s -> 19029.86s]  but Peter Storm Aaron until dawn, no spoilers.
[19030.74s -> 19031.46s]  He was it.
[19031.46s -> 19033.78s]  He was like, he was, he was a character.
[19033.78s -> 19034.58s]  He was an actor in that.
[19035.94s -> 19036.34s]  Nevermind.
[19037.70s -> 19038.26s]  He was an actor.
[19061.86s -> 19063.54s]  We can't skip any cut scene.
[19067.14s -> 19067.70s]  We've tried.
[19073.91s -> 19075.08s]  Oh, wow.
[19075.08s -> 19075.64s]  That's different.
[19076.28s -> 19077.16s]  Are you failing these?
[19077.72s -> 19078.76s]  There is nothing for me to do.
[19085.02s -> 19086.94s]  You skip the cut scene, you skip the game.
[19086.94s -> 19087.50s]  That's true.
[19089.02s -> 19097.10s]  Oh no, we have to walk.
[19097.90s -> 19100.46s]  I was going to say, yeah, this segment right here is pretty,
[19101.82s -> 19104.30s]  pretty lengthy until we get put in the room.
[19106.30s -> 19106.94s]  Nope.
[19106.94s -> 19107.50s]  No thanks.
[19109.64s -> 19109.88s]  Shit.
[19112.31s -> 19116.07s]  I think maybe if we just walk in a straight line and don't stop to look at anything,
[19116.07s -> 19117.03s]  it might just advance.
[19118.23s -> 19120.95s]  Somebody just teleported across the screen on the left for me.
[19121.91s -> 19129.29s]  No, don't interact with anything.
[19129.29s -> 19130.17s]  Just walk in a straight line.
[19134.62s -> 19137.58s]  Didn't, didn't this do get like shot in the leg?
[19139.02s -> 19140.94s]  Wouldn't you be more than limping right now?
[19141.90s -> 19142.78s]  Probably.
[19142.78s -> 19144.06s]  Like not able to walk.
[19145.02s -> 19147.00s]  Hold on.
[19147.00s -> 19148.12s]  There is something you can do.
[19148.84s -> 19151.51s]  Which, which character are you?
[19152.55s -> 19153.11s]  I'm Julie.
[19153.83s -> 19155.19s]  Oh, try this.
[19160.28s -> 19160.52s]  Okay.
[19160.52s -> 19160.84s]  We're good.
[19160.84s -> 19161.32s]  We're in the room.
[19166.22s -> 19166.94s]  Oh no.
[19166.94s -> 19168.06s]  What, what even is that?
[19169.10s -> 19169.26s]  Yeah.
[19169.26s -> 19171.42s]  What did the, what, what is, I don't know.
[19171.42s -> 19182.54s]  That's a handcuff or we're skipping jump scares.
[19185.32s -> 19186.44s]  He's the guy in the haunted house.
[19186.44s -> 19188.20s]  When you go with a group of friends that doesn't just
[19188.20s -> 19190.60s]  want to get through it as fast as possible.
[19190.60s -> 19191.08s]  Go, go, go.
[19191.08s -> 19191.64s]  I don't want to see this.
[19191.64s -> 19194.84s]  Like the clown, the scary clown could dismiss the queue because
[19194.84s -> 19196.20s]  your friend wants to go so damn fast.
[19196.92s -> 19209.64s]  What are they going to do with us?
[19216.01s -> 19216.41s]  Oh shit.
[19222.12s -> 19223.96s]  This is just the haunted house with the friends.
[19223.96s -> 19224.68s]  That's what this is.
[19228.28s -> 19229.80s]  I was just becoming the monster.
[19231.64s -> 19231.96s]  Okay.
[19232.68s -> 19233.16s]  All of you.
[19235.78s -> 19237.22s]  We made it actually was not that long.
[19237.22s -> 19238.90s]  That was a full 10 straight minutes.
[19238.90s -> 19239.46s]  Funny story.
[19239.46s -> 19241.86s]  I just kind of sat there while you walk knowing that you would
[19241.86s -> 19245.86s]  you like me over to the new and I kept turning around trying
[19245.86s -> 19248.18s]  to like piss off the guard enough to make me do something.
[19249.38s -> 19251.46s]  Pirates are actors and they can't hurt you.
[19251.78s -> 19253.86s]  Hey, it's pitch black in here.
[19254.66s -> 19254.90s]  Give us.
[19259.78s -> 19261.38s]  That's my joke.
[19261.38s -> 19262.26s]  I used that yesterday.
[19262.26s -> 19262.58s]  Sorry.
[19262.58s -> 19262.90s]  Did you?
[19263.78s -> 19264.50s]  That's funny.
[19264.50s -> 19265.86s]  I got a copyright claim.
[19265.86s -> 19266.42s]  That one.
[19266.42s -> 19266.74s]  That's it.
[19269.96s -> 19280.36s]  All right.
[19280.36s -> 19281.40s]  Now how do we go from here?
[19285.80s -> 19288.52s]  Um, I think we just move the table.
[19288.52s -> 19289.56s]  Yeah, we just didn't move table.
[19289.56s -> 19290.04s]  Leave it open.
[19290.60s -> 19297.34s]  Wherever we are.
[19297.34s -> 19298.14s]  It's not good.
[19298.94s -> 19308.23s]  I can't believe it's taken this long for us to have something like
[19308.23s -> 19309.43s]  We can't just sit around.
[19310.07s -> 19310.87s]  We need a plan.
[19311.85s -> 19315.93s]  Yeah, we're not exactly in the best position to be making any
[19315.93s -> 19316.25s]  All right.
[19316.25s -> 19319.13s]  Good stuff should be coming up because they're going to hear us and break in.
[19319.13s -> 19320.01s]  We just don't run.
[19320.01s -> 19322.01s]  Got to take advantage of it and get off the ship.
[19323.37s -> 19327.72s]  Just don't do anything.
[19327.72s -> 19333.34s]  And I don't think all of us are currently strong enough to mount an escape.
[19334.06s -> 19336.78s]  We cared so much about the beginning too.
[19336.78s -> 19338.70s]  We tried to like do like the double hostage.
[19338.70s -> 19339.74s]  I'll go for the gun.
[19339.74s -> 19341.66s]  They don't matter.
[19341.66s -> 19343.34s]  It's going to be difficult to get anywhere without it.
[19343.90s -> 19351.43s]  I got shocked.
[19351.43s -> 19352.47s]  Maybe we can.
[19352.47s -> 19354.47s]  Yeah, kill all hallucinations by the way.
[19355.11s -> 19356.95s]  No, you can't hotwire it.
[19356.95s -> 19358.07s]  We need the distributor.
[19358.07s -> 19360.31s]  That's the only it's probably the only way to kill them.
[19361.43s -> 19365.19s]  I think they just really want you to be the reason why the main cast dies.
[19365.19s -> 19371.32s]  Got to take advantage and look around for a way out of here.
[19371.32s -> 19371.64s]  All right.
[19371.64s -> 19374.60s]  So let's go to the thing in the wall right here.
[19375.32s -> 19377.99s]  It's like in the corner, right?
[19384.20s -> 19390.39s]  Get that fucking thing open.
[19392.38s -> 19394.84s]  Hey, what I found over here.
[19395.24s -> 19410.76s]  What's going on?
[19411.93s -> 19421.24s]  Uh, he has to try and fail while we continue to look around the room.
[19421.24s -> 19421.72s]  I don't know.
[19422.52s -> 19429.80s]  We might have to trigger something here.
[19430.36s -> 19433.45s]  We might.
[19433.45s -> 19435.05s]  Yeah, I think we have to like touch something.
[19436.17s -> 19439.26s]  How about if we do that doing that forever?
[19442.10s -> 19443.16s]  Oh, here we go.
[19448.42s -> 19450.36s]  There's Alex.
[19450.36s -> 19450.84s]  Come take a look.
[19451.72s -> 19456.73s]  How's it looking?
[19456.73s -> 19457.77s]  I can't get it open.
[19457.77s -> 19458.57s]  There we go.
[19458.57s -> 19460.97s]  Well, whatever I was doing was not important.
[19468.28s -> 19471.29s]  So this time we're going to don't make any noise.
[19473.29s -> 19476.09s]  I think we just don't make a decision to barricade.
[19476.09s -> 19479.53s]  I had to make a decision to barricade or run or like hide.
[19479.53s -> 19480.49s]  So just stand around.
[19481.21s -> 19482.49s]  So we're just going to make a noise.
[19483.85s -> 19485.21s]  I have to make that choice.
[19487.61s -> 19492.30s]  See if they can get caught, I guess.
[19497.21s -> 19498.97s]  Oh, you're going full silence no matter what.
[19499.37s -> 19500.57s]  Oh, I mean, my decision was...
[19502.17s -> 19503.37s]  Okay, barricade the door.
[19503.37s -> 19504.49s]  Conrad, you do it.
[19504.49s -> 19504.81s]  Nothing.
[19512.09s -> 19514.01s]  So yeah, you go over and you go like,
[19514.01s -> 19514.89s]  Hey, you fucker.
[19514.89s -> 19516.09s]  Hey, you stupid fucker.
[19516.09s -> 19516.49s]  You dumb fucker.
[19541.99s -> 19543.19s]  One-legged fuck faces.
[19543.19s -> 19544.87s]  Yeah, you smarmy barmans.
[19544.87s -> 19545.59s]  Yeah, no, you.
[19545.59s -> 19548.15s]  I'm going to rip your pirate parents off your shoulders
[19548.15s -> 19550.55s]  and stomp them into rainbow-colored stew.
[19550.55s -> 19552.66s]  I'm warning you.
[19553.22s -> 19554.74s]  I am an American citizen.
[19554.74s -> 19556.90s]  You really want me as president coming after you guys?
[19556.90s -> 19558.02s]  Because he will.
[19558.02s -> 19559.54s]  Each and every one of you personally.
[19560.42s -> 19561.69s]  Very personally.
[19561.69s -> 19562.73s]  Can we just not run?
[19565.37s -> 19567.69s]  Hey, can you hear me?
[19568.41s -> 19569.21s]  I'm talking to you.
[19570.44s -> 19570.94s]  I...
[19572.28s -> 19573.96s]  We go through, then I can...
[19576.28s -> 19577.64s]  Do not pull the cover back.
[19578.36s -> 19579.24s]  His leaf is open.
[19581.88s -> 19591.88s]  I'll do nothing, I guess.
[19596.36s -> 19596.86s]  What?
[19603.08s -> 19603.58s]  Oh, no.
[19604.28s -> 19604.84s]  He got me.
[19607.80s -> 19610.68s]  I got the one non-playable character for this next segment.
[19612.26s -> 19613.06s]  Great success.
[19621.21s -> 19621.93s]  Isn't she not?
[19621.93s -> 19622.41s]  No, she's not.
[19622.41s -> 19623.85s]  Yeah, she's not in either crew.
[19625.37s -> 19627.13s]  You don't play as her for a long time.
[19627.77s -> 19628.73s]  Not to the end of the game, I don't think.
[19629.53s -> 19631.05s]  I'm the reason she got snagged.
[19631.05s -> 19631.61s]  Yep.
[19631.61s -> 19632.57s]  Gotta get her.
[19632.57s -> 19633.07s]  No way.
[19633.69s -> 19634.81s]  No heroics.
[19634.81s -> 19636.57s]  We gotta get as far away from here as we can.
[19639.03s -> 19642.20s]  What?
[19642.20s -> 19643.56s]  You can't decide to go back?
[19643.56s -> 19644.06s]  No.
[19644.76s -> 19646.44s]  So hard to kill all these people.
[19646.44s -> 19650.12s]  That's the premise of Cabin in the Woods.
[19650.12s -> 19650.92s]  Look, through the haunted house.
[19673.75s -> 19674.87s]  That room was blinking.
[19674.87s -> 19675.75s]  Please come in here.
[19676.55s -> 19677.05s]  No.
[19677.67s -> 19678.86s]  I think I'm all right.
[19681.19s -> 19682.47s]  Just keep going.
[19683.03s -> 19685.03s]  Why am I...
[19685.03s -> 19686.87s]  How do you walk faster in this game?
[19686.87s -> 19687.91s]  Left bumper?
[19687.91s -> 19688.47s]  Hold it.
[19688.47s -> 19689.11s]  That's why I thought.
[19689.11s -> 19689.59s]  But I don't...
[19689.59s -> 19690.71s]  It doesn't actually go faster.
[19691.43s -> 19692.71s]  I think it's a placebo effect.
[19694.71s -> 19696.60s]  But you're always faster than me.
[19697.58s -> 19698.08s]  Am I?
[19698.78s -> 19699.98s]  Yeah, you're way ahead of me.
[19700.62s -> 19701.42s]  Well, I'm just...
[19701.42s -> 19704.14s]  I am also walking as the guy who got shot in the leg.
[19706.38s -> 19708.06s]  But I was still this slow the rest of the game.
[19708.06s -> 19711.10s]  Maybe everyone's hiding in the hole for a big surprise party.
[19711.10s -> 19711.90s]  Because of the bullet.
[19712.94s -> 19717.59s]  This isn't happening to me previously though.
[19717.59s -> 19719.19s]  He didn't get shot in the leg last time.
[19720.15s -> 19721.27s]  I just bumped the camera.
[19722.39s -> 19723.11s]  Oh, sorry.
[19723.11s -> 19723.75s]  Sorry, Jerry.
[19724.39s -> 19726.26s]  I'm supposed to go this way?
[19726.26s -> 19726.58s]  This way?
[19726.58s -> 19726.82s]  That way?
[19726.82s -> 19727.06s]  Okay.
[19727.06s -> 19727.46s]  I'm sorry.
[19729.88s -> 19730.44s]  All right.
[19730.44s -> 19731.72s]  That did not happen before.
[19732.44s -> 19733.80s]  I didn't even see that.
[19733.80s -> 19735.16s]  I was probably reading some lore.
[19736.44s -> 19738.28s]  Kind of important to see that.
[19739.40s -> 19740.68s]  I got yoinked last time.
[19743.46s -> 19744.74s]  Like this, actually.
[19745.22s -> 19745.72s]  Hi.
[19746.26s -> 19748.94s]  Wasn't I shot in the head?
[19748.94s -> 19749.44s]  Yes.
[19750.22s -> 19750.72s]  Sort of.
[19751.28s -> 19754.36s]  There's someone down there.
[19754.36s -> 19757.76s]  So you already got both these people caught.
[19757.76s -> 19758.40s]  Nothing happens.
[19758.40s -> 19760.00s]  What happens if you just don't go down?
[19760.00s -> 19761.20s]  What happens if I just don't do it?
[19761.20s -> 19762.08s]  I'm just not gonna do anything.
[19762.08s -> 19763.68s]  I'm not gonna throw any stuff down there.
[19792.83s -> 19794.19s]  We should grab it.
[19804.38s -> 19805.90s]  Sorry, I almost did something there.
[19806.92s -> 19807.64s]  Accidentally.
[19807.64s -> 19808.14s]  Okay.
[19809.00s -> 19811.02s]  I actively had to try to do nothing there.
[19811.02s -> 19811.90s]  I almost fucked it up.
[19822.84s -> 19824.76s]  I think the biggest problem is the whole...
[19824.76s -> 19825.32s]  Holy crap.
[19825.32s -> 19828.52s]  You actually control a party of five characters gimmick because
[19829.56s -> 19832.52s]  you only get to control one character for a very brief amount of time,
[19832.52s -> 19834.28s]  and then if you choose not to,
[19834.28s -> 19835.24s]  that dude's just like,
[19835.24s -> 19835.80s]  I don't care.
[19835.80s -> 19836.68s]  I'm going anyway.
[19838.20s -> 19839.80s]  And you didn't tell him to do that.
[19840.44s -> 19841.88s]  I didn't tell him to do anything, actually.
[19842.44s -> 19843.08s]  That's what I mean.
[19843.72s -> 19844.52s]  I just sat there.
[19844.52s -> 19845.80s]  You don't actually have any control.
[19846.52s -> 19859.28s]  Somebody mentioned that until dawn
[19860.08s -> 19862.72s]  has a period where like the first few hours or so,
[19862.72s -> 19863.76s]  the first couple hours,
[19863.76s -> 19865.68s]  nobody, you can't like anybody killed.
[19865.68s -> 19868.72s]  The only difference though is this game is only like three hours long
[19869.36s -> 19872.72s]  until dawn is like at least like what?
[19872.72s -> 19874.80s]  Like six, seven, eight hours at least.
[19882.78s -> 19883.74s]  So that can happen.
[19888.96s -> 19892.09s]  Wait, what?
[19892.09s -> 19893.77s]  When did that happen?
[19905.20s -> 19909.32s]  So I have an option to throw something here.
[19910.46s -> 19911.34s]  What if I just don't?
[19913.56s -> 19914.68s]  If you just throw nothing?
[19915.72s -> 19919.98s]  I mean, I can throw it at him.
[19919.98s -> 19922.06s]  No, we don't.
[19922.06s -> 19925.10s]  We haven't got to play in like a full, like three minutes.
[19928.27s -> 19929.95s]  Yeah, we've just kind of just been watching the.
[19931.07s -> 19935.64s]  I think that's, I think it's like length.
[19935.64s -> 19936.36s]  I think that's the problem.
[19937.52s -> 19939.84s]  Because when you got to that point,
[19939.84s -> 19941.44s]  like two hours into until dawn,
[19941.44s -> 19943.12s]  when it really, really started to get going,
[19943.12s -> 19945.44s]  you had a whole game there that was still going.
[19945.44s -> 19947.36s]  This is like two or three hours in.
[19948.16s -> 19948.48s]  All right.
[19948.48s -> 19949.76s]  And who died at the end of the game?
[19949.76s -> 19951.28s]  Who fucking killed that guy?
[19951.28s -> 19953.20s]  You stabbed yourself in the stomach by credits.
[19954.36s -> 19955.48s]  It just kind of jumps up on you.
[19955.48s -> 19956.28s]  Where are you taking us?
[19956.28s -> 19956.92s]  Very, very quickly.
[19956.92s -> 19957.48s]  I don't know what they're telling you.
[19957.48s -> 19958.12s]  Yeah, get out of here.
[19958.12s -> 19959.00s]  They're like closing it down.
[19959.80s -> 19960.83s]  I can't move.
[19961.79s -> 19964.00s]  Can you move?
[19966.62s -> 19967.79s]  I can.
[19967.79s -> 19968.03s]  No.
[19968.59s -> 19969.39s]  Yeah, can I?
[19969.39s -> 19969.79s]  Who am?
[19970.91s -> 19972.03s]  Okay, I'm flissed.
[19975.56s -> 19977.16s]  I'm not even touching the controller
[19977.16s -> 19979.40s]  and Alex is phasing into the wall at the moment.
[19980.04s -> 19982.60s]  And it's also a close-up of somebody's ass.
[19985.98s -> 19987.18s]  And ass is gone.
[19988.52s -> 19989.40s]  All right, let's go.
[19993.05s -> 19993.69s]  I can't.
[19993.69s -> 19994.97s]  I can't do anything.
[19999.48s -> 19999.96s]  You ready?
[19999.96s -> 20001.16s]  I'm ready to take him out.
[20002.52s -> 20006.60s]  I'm stuck in the wall.
[20013.24s -> 20015.39s]  Stop.
[20015.39s -> 20018.59s]  Because wait, but like we're going so quickly right now.
[20018.59s -> 20020.75s]  We are like getting to the point.
[20021.47s -> 20022.67s]  I'm not going anywhere.
[20025.21s -> 20026.17s]  But just in general,
[20026.17s -> 20028.49s]  we're like at that halfway point of the whole game.
[20029.05s -> 20030.09s]  We're trying pausing it.
[20035.05s -> 20035.53s]  What's wrong?
[20036.49s -> 20040.73s]  Like my characters, there's no, I can't control anybody.
[20040.73s -> 20042.73s]  There's a stationary shot.
[20042.73s -> 20045.13s]  Alex is trying to become into the wall.
[20049.53s -> 20050.65s]  Am I being pranked?
[20051.93s -> 20052.81s]  I don't think so.
[20053.45s -> 20054.49s]  It happened to me before too.
[20057.72s -> 20062.46s]  Because I, maybe if I just get to the end of this area
[20062.46s -> 20063.90s]  and you get forced into a cutscene.
[20082.40s -> 20083.44s]  It's just frozen.
[20086.75s -> 20088.19s]  And then we walk this way and then.
[20090.46s -> 20091.66s]  These fucking places.
[20095.42s -> 20095.66s]  Okay.
[20096.30s -> 20099.71s]  Touch hat, touch hat.
[20099.71s -> 20100.35s]  No, I can't.
[20100.35s -> 20100.83s]  Sorry, Jeff.
[20106.81s -> 20109.68s]  Okay.
[20109.68s -> 20110.08s]  Question.
[20110.08s -> 20113.44s]  Do you think if you push start on man of Medan?
[20116.28s -> 20116.76s]  Hold on.
[20117.95s -> 20118.83s]  If I press start.
[20119.55s -> 20120.12s]  No, no, no.
[20120.12s -> 20120.52s]  Not you.
[20120.52s -> 20122.36s]  Like if, like if you started a new game
[20123.26s -> 20125.66s]  and then walked away from the controller and came back,
[20125.66s -> 20127.58s]  would it be at the credits without you doing anything?
[20129.42s -> 20130.62s]  I don't, maybe.
[20130.62s -> 20131.42s]  Depends on what you mean.
[20131.42s -> 20133.02s]  Like the computer will do it for you.
[20133.66s -> 20137.58s]  Like will they force you through each segment of the story
[20137.58s -> 20138.94s]  after a certain amount of time
[20138.94s -> 20142.94s]  without you having to physically touch the controller?
[20142.94s -> 20145.58s]  It's possible because there is a movie version of the game.
[20146.70s -> 20148.86s]  You know, it's shared movie experience.
[20148.86s -> 20151.26s]  So I have to imagine that it's built into the game somehow.
[20152.70s -> 20154.81s]  Christ.
[20154.81s -> 20155.53s]  Oh Christ.
[20156.17s -> 20158.01s]  That guy.
[20158.01s -> 20159.69s]  That guy's probably still right here with us.
[20160.33s -> 20162.65s]  I mean, you die on a ship.
[20162.65s -> 20163.85s]  Your ghost stays on the ship.
[20163.85s -> 20168.22s]  I'm telling you, if I'm a ghost, I ain't fucking sticking around.
[20168.22s -> 20169.34s]  You know what I mean?
[20169.34s -> 20170.78s]  I'm going to be going on a ghost vacation.
[20180.16s -> 20180.80s]  I remember that.
[20180.80s -> 20181.44s]  I remember that.
[20181.44s -> 20183.04s]  I remember when I did that, that was that we're about,
[20183.04s -> 20185.36s]  we're about 67% of the way through the game
[20185.36s -> 20190.68s]  because it was at that point in the game.
[20190.68s -> 20191.88s]  Even better the second time around.
[20192.44s -> 20208.28s]  Oh, okay.
[20208.28s -> 20209.40s]  This is where he goes, no.
[20220.92s -> 20225.71s]  You all right, dude?
[20227.58s -> 20228.06s]  Look out.
[20228.78s -> 20231.10s]  Shoot it.
[20231.10s -> 20232.06s]  It's right around the corner.
[20232.70s -> 20233.34s]  I'm going to get it.
[20238.38s -> 20241.76s]  Okay.
[20241.76s -> 20242.48s]  What just happened?
[20243.28s -> 20244.81s]  I don't know.
[20244.81s -> 20245.13s]  All right.
[20246.01s -> 20248.08s]  Let's go.
[20248.64s -> 20253.64s]  It's time for someone to die.
[20254.36s -> 20257.90s]  Is it going to be me or is it going to be Italics?
[20257.90s -> 20258.62s]  That's the question.
[20258.62s -> 20261.37s]  Hey, what?
[20261.37s -> 20262.97s]  I am actively going to try to kill Italics.
[20262.97s -> 20264.09s]  Come on, we should keep moving.
[20264.09s -> 20265.84s]  Is my Italics is still stuck?
[20266.48s -> 20268.96s]  Hold on.
[20268.96s -> 20269.92s]  You're still stuck?
[20274.09s -> 20274.73s]  Yeah.
[20274.73s -> 20278.09s]  Somebody in chat said that the only way that they could fix it
[20278.09s -> 20280.57s]  is by re-inviting someone to their game.
[20282.81s -> 20283.05s]  Wait.
[20283.05s -> 20285.13s]  That's why I was asking, hey, if you didn't do anything,
[20285.13s -> 20286.65s]  do you think the game would complete itself?
[20286.65s -> 20289.29s]  Because I was wondering if you would just by yourself
[20289.29s -> 20291.61s]  able to advance the law.
[20291.61s -> 20294.25s]  You're definitely going to have to be pulled in here soon.
[20294.25s -> 20295.93s]  I'm like almost at the point where you have to be.
[20296.65s -> 20299.29s]  Well, I'm at the very beginning of when we took control.
[20299.85s -> 20301.05s]  And you're just standing there?
[20302.09s -> 20304.17s]  If you look closely on my screen on the left side,
[20304.17s -> 20308.57s]  you can see the calves of Alex walking into the wall
[20309.21s -> 20310.09s]  over and over again.
[20311.69s -> 20313.13s]  I'm curious of what happens here then.
[20313.13s -> 20320.24s]  I also did this at a portion of the actual playthrough.
[20320.24s -> 20322.00s]  And you did you like me to the next scene.
[20322.00s -> 20323.12s]  It was very abrupt.
[20323.12s -> 20324.32s]  Well, let's see what happens.
[20324.32s -> 20325.12s]  That's about to happen.
[20325.92s -> 20332.67s]  There you go.
[20333.63s -> 20334.43s]  This part here.
[20335.63s -> 20335.95s]  Look.
[20335.95s -> 20336.83s]  Oh, what's that?
[20336.83s -> 20338.35s]  Oh, no, there's something here.
[20343.45s -> 20344.57s]  So funny story.
[20344.57s -> 20347.53s]  We've already missed, despite trying our best,
[20347.53s -> 20350.57s]  two guaranteed opportunities to kill a character.
[20351.37s -> 20351.85s]  What are they?
[20352.81s -> 20357.21s]  Uh, the first one is drink the beer after the decompression.
[20357.21s -> 20361.69s]  And I was silent on the beer, so I did not drink it.
[20361.69s -> 20363.93s]  She also doesn't die until the end of the game.
[20363.93s -> 20367.21s]  If you do that, who would do that?
[20368.33s -> 20372.01s]  First of all, you have to be reckless to swim up to the surface without decompressing.
[20372.01s -> 20375.13s]  And second, they give you like a public service announcement
[20375.13s -> 20379.37s]  sponsored by the government about why you shouldn't drink beer
[20379.93s -> 20382.65s]  because they probably didn't want someone to watch this game.
[20383.37s -> 20385.45s]  And it's like a don't try this at home moment.
[20388.72s -> 20390.80s]  So what's in the beer?
[20391.84s -> 20398.96s]  Well, the beer reacts with the bins or whatever that you get from decompression.
[20401.52s -> 20408.56s]  If you get the bins and you drink beer, you're just basically gonna die eventually.
[20408.56s -> 20409.12s]  Just don't do it.
[20409.68s -> 20413.28s]  All right, well, I'm currently being choked.
[20417.21s -> 20422.09s]  The second way is, you know, when they do the thunder window escape,
[20422.09s -> 20426.09s]  you actually have to succeed at opening the window.
[20426.09s -> 20433.48s]  So Conrad can die on the boat.
[20441.63s -> 20444.75s]  The best part about this is you explaining the scenes.
[20446.27s -> 20447.63s]  Oh, fuck off, game.
[20447.63s -> 20449.31s]  I have no idea what you're doing.
[20449.31s -> 20450.11s]  Fuck this game.
[20451.07s -> 20455.26s]  I mean, you don't have to tell me twice.
[20456.62s -> 20457.34s]  I'm stuck here.
[20496.57s -> 20497.69s]  Failed the second QTE.
[20498.49s -> 20499.85s]  That zombie grabbed me.
[20499.85s -> 20502.01s]  Then I might get my face pulled into the ground.
[20502.73s -> 20508.73s]  And then third attempt for a QTE, zombie comes out of the ground and grabs my face.
[20508.73s -> 20510.09s]  Like, I'm gonna break your neck.
[20510.09s -> 20512.89s]  Like, I'm literally murdering you.
[20512.89s -> 20516.89s]  Last chance for a QTE, like, he does like a, you're dead thing.
[20516.89s -> 20519.45s]  And then it goes to black and it just shows her line on the ground.
[20519.45s -> 20521.21s]  And then it cuts back up from black and I go,
[20523.45s -> 20525.58s]  it was like three or four QTEs that I failed.
[20525.58s -> 20526.86s]  And then I was like dead on the ground.
[20527.50s -> 20530.78s]  Yeah, I failed four underwater with no oxygen mask.
[20531.90s -> 20532.30s]  We're live.
[20532.30s -> 20533.58s]  And the zombies aren't real though.
[20533.58s -> 20534.14s]  That's true.
[20534.78s -> 20543.00s]  They are an illusion.
[20543.00s -> 20543.48s]  That is true.
[20543.48s -> 20544.20s]  That is an illusion.
[20544.20s -> 20544.52s]  All right.
[20544.52s -> 20545.32s]  Are you, are you back?
[20545.88s -> 20546.12s]  Yeah.
[20547.10s -> 20548.14s]  All right, guys, welcome back.
[20548.94s -> 20549.58s]  Here we go.
[20549.58s -> 20550.06s]  Are you ready?
[20551.66s -> 20552.70s]  Here's the decision to make.
[20552.70s -> 20554.70s]  Compelling gameplay going on over here.
[20579.34s -> 20579.90s]  How are you doing?
[20581.53s -> 20582.81s]  Oh, I'm chilling.
[20582.81s -> 20583.85s]  You're still stuck?
[20584.65s -> 20586.33s]  Yeah, no, I'm good.
[20586.33s -> 20587.85s]  How the hell does this play out then?
[20588.81s -> 20590.01s]  I don't know, but I ain't moving.
[20592.46s -> 20594.46s]  Because this is a new, are you still Alex?
[20594.46s -> 20595.26s]  It's me and Julia.
[20596.67s -> 20597.31s]  You're still Alex.
[20597.31s -> 20598.67s]  Alex and Julia are here.
[20598.67s -> 20603.71s]  I don't, yeah, Alex, I'm supposed to be Alex, but Alex is walking into the wall.
[20605.23s -> 20606.35s]  He's just going, man.
[20609.44s -> 20610.40s]  So what?
[20611.12s -> 20613.76s]  Keep your head on straight.
[20613.76s -> 20614.56s]  So what?
[20615.20s -> 20616.80s]  Who's going to try to come after me?
[20618.16s -> 20620.40s]  I'm curious how this is going to work because you.
[20620.40s -> 20621.60s]  Well, Brad's gone.
[20621.60s -> 20624.08s]  So wherever Brad is, he's off on his own.
[20625.12s -> 20630.12s]  You should have been yoinked by now.
[20630.68s -> 20632.92s]  Are you just playing the game against the AI?
[20633.72s -> 20636.44s]  I mean, technically you're supposed to come in now, right?
[20639.61s -> 20642.09s]  Um, I don't know.
[20642.09s -> 20646.97s]  I think technically, you know that Conrad can die on the boat if you fail the right QTE.
[20646.97s -> 20647.77s]  Stick to the script.
[20647.77s -> 20648.01s]  Okay.
[20648.81s -> 20651.63s]  All right.
[20651.63s -> 20652.51s]  I'm going to stick to the script.
[20658.84s -> 20660.52s]  It's like hard to die in this game.
[20660.52s -> 20664.04s]  I'm like reading all the ways to kill people and it's it's like a challenge.
[20664.68s -> 20666.36s]  I feel like I'm looking up the achievement guide.
[20668.70s -> 20669.82s]  Don't go outside.
[20669.82s -> 20670.22s]  Why not?
[20672.65s -> 20674.76s]  I got bad news.
[20674.76s -> 20675.96s]  Do you have any spoiler for you?
[20678.75s -> 20683.23s]  The next opportunity for a character to die is not until we get to play as Fliss.
[20684.19s -> 20685.39s]  I mean, I am Fliss.
[20686.03s -> 20686.91s]  Oh, yeah.
[20687.79s -> 20689.50s]  Maybe that's what I didn't know.
[20689.50s -> 20690.54s]  Don't go outside.
[20691.10s -> 20693.18s]  Don't don't don't don't don't go outside.
[20693.18s -> 20693.58s]  Why not?
[20697.88s -> 20698.60s]  Don't go outside.
[20698.60s -> 20699.16s]  Go to the door.
[20699.16s -> 20700.04s]  Women don't go outside.
[20703.13s -> 20704.25s]  Don't open this again.
[20704.25s -> 20705.45s]  I'm trying to pull him into the game.
[20706.17s -> 20706.49s]  Oops.
[20707.13s -> 20711.53s]  Someone said pause and unpause, but that didn't change or disconnect my controller.
[20714.78s -> 20716.46s]  Just fuck around for a while.
[20716.46s -> 20716.70s]  What?
[20723.53s -> 20724.17s]  Don't do it.
[20725.45s -> 20726.25s]  Don't go aside.
[20727.05s -> 20730.28s]  What do you mean I can die if I go out there?
[20730.28s -> 20731.16s]  Isn't that the point?
[20731.80s -> 20744.59s]  So what the fuck do you want me to do?
[20748.60s -> 20750.28s]  You won't die if you go outside.
[20752.27s -> 20752.51s]  All right.
[20752.51s -> 20753.79s]  So what what do you mean stay?
[20753.79s -> 20755.23s]  What if I stay inside?
[20755.23s -> 20759.00s]  But then how am I going to pull italics into the game?
[20763.69s -> 20766.01s]  I feel like I've been streaming for 14 hours.
[20768.12s -> 20768.68s]  You know what I mean?
[20768.68s -> 20770.84s]  Like it's just I'm finally got pulled.
[20771.87s -> 20772.59s]  Thank God.
[20774.97s -> 20777.93s]  And like Twitch's servers are like getting shit on.
[20777.93s -> 20778.73s]  That's what I mean.
[20779.61s -> 20785.66s]  I'm just going outside.
[20787.50s -> 20788.14s]  I'm going for it.
[20788.14s -> 20789.66s]  I'm finally get to play.
[20789.66s -> 20791.34s]  We need to italics has to play.
[20792.14s -> 20795.82s]  I'm I am playing just now.
[20802.30s -> 20803.50s]  I'm in the room with the poison.
[20803.50s -> 20806.46s]  Yeah, but don't doesn't he need to come up here?
[20807.26s -> 20811.71s]  Remember this?
[20811.71s -> 20811.95s]  All right.
[20811.95s -> 20814.12s]  Do I do I have anything I can do?
[20816.97s -> 20817.29s]  All right.
[20817.29s -> 20821.79s]  Do the do the McDonald's menu tier list.
[20822.51s -> 20824.04s]  Hang on.
[20824.04s -> 20828.68s]  I finally get to be Brad and see what was supposed to happen the first time.
[20829.40s -> 20829.64s]  What?
[20832.57s -> 20834.73s]  This is where I went AFK in the original playthrough.
[20834.73s -> 20837.95s]  And I want I want to know how this new content.
[20839.21s -> 20851.61s]  Never before seen DLC of Brad eat the berries, eat the berries.
[20852.65s -> 20856.11s]  There are no berries here.
[20863.10s -> 20865.50s]  Hey, Brad, I am Brad.
[20868.65s -> 20870.57s]  Remember when you were like, hey, are you Brad?
[20870.57s -> 20871.37s]  That was so funny.
[20872.25s -> 20873.37s]  It was though.
[20873.37s -> 20874.33s]  It was pretty funny.
[20875.80s -> 20877.16s]  Everyone was so mad.
[20877.88s -> 20889.28s]  Wait, are you Fliss right now?
[20889.28s -> 20889.52s]  Yes.
[20890.32s -> 20891.76s]  Did you just silence treatment me?
[20892.86s -> 20893.42s]  In the game?
[20894.14s -> 20894.38s]  Yeah.
[20895.92s -> 20896.24s]  Huh?
[20897.98s -> 20898.94s]  What are you talking about?
[20898.94s -> 20900.38s]  If you didn't just talk to Brad.
[20904.32s -> 20906.08s]  Oh, I didn't get to see this last time.
[20907.88s -> 20909.24s]  This part actually would have been cool.
[20912.38s -> 20915.58s]  See, you would have asked me that same question.
[20915.58s -> 20916.38s]  You see chat.
[20917.18s -> 20918.46s]  He just asked that question.
[20918.46s -> 20920.54s]  But I already know how it goes down.
[20920.54s -> 20923.82s]  Yeah, but if you didn't know that how it went down and you're like, hey.
[20926.12s -> 20928.60s]  Listen, here's the facts are I didn't know.
[20930.36s -> 20933.56s]  At this point in the game, I didn't know that it was just not a monster.
[20934.12s -> 20936.28s]  By the way, I'm actually real human.
[20936.28s -> 20939.48s]  I just thought you had come into control of the monsters
[20939.48s -> 20941.32s]  and we're playing as the bad guys now.
[20941.32s -> 20944.68s]  Oh, I thought that would have been a cool way to do it.
[20944.68s -> 20947.56s]  Where one of the players gets infected by the mist
[20948.52s -> 20950.68s]  and you're now the antagonist trying to like
[20951.24s -> 20954.33s]  dungeon master the other person's game.
[20954.33s -> 20956.17s]  Guys, I can't eat any fucking food.
[20956.17s -> 20957.29s]  What are you talking about?
[20958.01s -> 20958.33s]  Food?
[20960.35s -> 20962.03s]  I can't eat the food on the table.
[20962.03s -> 20963.87s]  It doesn't have a glowy thing on it.
[20963.87s -> 20966.33s]  This food cart.
[20966.33s -> 20967.13s]  What do you want me to eat?
[20967.93s -> 20973.53s]  All right.
[20973.53s -> 20976.81s]  So I think it actually turns out I picked the right point to go AFK
[20976.81s -> 20978.57s]  because I don't think anything happens in here.
[20979.21s -> 20980.73s]  I think this is just.
[20980.73s -> 20981.85s]  Oh, wait, maybe it does.
[20981.85s -> 20987.10s]  I think I have to spin the bullet.
[20987.10s -> 20991.98s]  What are you doing?
[20992.70s -> 20993.90s]  No, not you like this.
[20994.70s -> 21007.64s]  There's another food cart.
[21008.96s -> 21010.08s]  There's no food carts.
[21021.26s -> 21023.52s]  Oh, wait, what?
[21024.25s -> 21025.53s]  I still don't understand.
[21027.47s -> 21029.07s]  And I'm here for it this time.
[21029.95s -> 21036.51s]  Jolly Jack.
[21036.51s -> 21037.71s]  I actually am.
[21037.71s -> 21038.91s]  This may be more confused.
[21045.29s -> 21053.90s]  It's really kind of annoying that they have to replace that every day.
[21054.94s -> 21059.26s]  I mean, that's a cool gimmick, but somebody has to replace all that every day for a quarter.
[21060.22s -> 21060.54s]  Oof.
[21062.57s -> 21063.53s]  Actual nightmare.
[21064.25s -> 21080.70s]  And no berries, guys.
[21092.75s -> 21094.67s]  You guys are fucking with me.
[21099.42s -> 21101.90s]  There's a food cart with thousands of berries on it.
[21104.14s -> 21105.66s]  You are full of shit.
[21118.62s -> 21138.28s]  Back left of the room, north left, left.
[21138.28s -> 21143.00s]  What direction do you think I'm walking at the moment?
[21143.00s -> 21162.92s]  It was all just a dream.
[21163.56s -> 21164.68s]  How do I do this?
[21165.40s -> 21168.04s]  You went AFK during the looping dream segment.
[21168.76s -> 21169.48s]  Is that what you did?
[21170.28s -> 21170.52s]  Yeah.
[21171.39s -> 21172.67s]  That's so funny.
[21172.67s -> 21174.51s]  This is the part that I like missed before.
[21178.67s -> 21181.55s]  And this is what it transitioned into, I think.
[21181.55s -> 21183.39s]  So then do I just have to wait for you to get up here?
[21193.39s -> 21195.71s]  Probably, because that's what yoinked me.
[21195.71s -> 21198.11s]  I mean, I did the thing I was supposed to do this time and it didn't.
[21198.11s -> 21199.55s]  Nothing different happened.
[21199.55s -> 21200.83s]  So now I'm going to open the door.
[21201.63s -> 21202.03s]  Yeah.
[21202.03s -> 21203.47s]  Now I have to kill you.
[21203.47s -> 21203.71s]  Yes.
[21204.59s -> 21209.04s]  So now I have to just like leave.
[21209.76s -> 21213.64s]  Okay.
[21214.36s -> 21215.24s]  Here we go.
[21215.24s -> 21217.40s]  I think I end up jumping off here anyways.
[21218.92s -> 21223.24s]  I just did it myself instead of make you scare me into jumping.
[21224.28s -> 21228.81s]  This is a nice speed run tactic.
[21229.61s -> 21231.53s]  Okay.
[21231.53s -> 21231.77s]  So.
[21234.83s -> 21235.07s]  All right.
[21235.07s -> 21235.55s]  That's you.
[21236.27s -> 21238.14s]  What was that close up?
[21239.10s -> 21244.01s]  Except you're like a zambie with a fist bump.
[21257.72s -> 21258.28s]  You didn't wait.
[21258.28s -> 21259.56s]  You didn't look like this before.
[21261.79s -> 21262.03s]  What?
[21266.81s -> 21267.93s]  What just happened?
[21267.93s -> 21269.13s]  You didn't look like that before.
[21269.69s -> 21270.81s]  Did you just mess it up?
[21272.03s -> 21272.43s]  No.
[21272.43s -> 21272.67s]  What?
[21273.39s -> 21277.08s]  I didn't even get a chance.
[21278.41s -> 21282.12s]  It's because I stayed in the room.
[21286.52s -> 21286.84s]  Wow.
[21286.84s -> 21288.60s]  It's really hard to kill people in this game.
[21291.32s -> 21292.76s]  Neither of you found a weapon.
[21293.80s -> 21298.30s]  So I didn't find a weapon so I couldn't kill you.
[21307.21s -> 21309.05s]  It seems like speed running is the best way.
[21309.05s -> 21310.17s]  Like fail everything.
[21310.17s -> 21310.73s]  Don't talk.
[21311.45s -> 21313.29s]  Keep going and you just will win.
[21313.29s -> 21315.45s]  Except maybe you won't save the boat.
[21315.45s -> 21317.37s]  I killed this person.
[21332.97s -> 21335.13s]  We're just playing it perfectly again.
[21336.01s -> 21337.63s]  We're just doing it again.
[21337.63s -> 21348.48s]  And I got up to like, yeah, you better run.
[21370.75s -> 21370.99s]  All right.
[21370.99s -> 21372.11s]  I'm going to encourage him this time.
[21380.32s -> 21380.72s]  Do it.
[21381.44s -> 21381.76s]  Do it.
[21382.32s -> 21382.72s]  Do it.
[21384.88s -> 21394.76s]  I'm not convinced that he's dead.
[21395.56s -> 21396.04s]  He's not.
[21396.04s -> 21397.00s]  He wakes up at the end of the game.
[21399.60s -> 21400.88s]  Nothing changes.
[21400.88s -> 21405.36s]  The only character that died last playthrough is that character.
[21420.22s -> 21421.18s]  It's the same run.
[21421.18s -> 21421.90s]  Nothing changed.
[21422.62s -> 21423.10s]  No.
[21423.10s -> 21424.46s]  Nothing has changed so far.
[21424.46s -> 21426.14s]  Somehow we're making the same choices.
[21432.32s -> 21434.16s]  Although technically everyone did run.
[21434.88s -> 21437.08s]  We're just playing the game again.
[21437.08s -> 21438.20s]  A second time through.
[21438.20s -> 21439.00s]  Yeah, I know.
[21441.00s -> 21443.24s]  We just liked it so much we played it twice for the people
[21443.24s -> 21445.40s]  that couldn't make it to the first showing of the stream.
[21446.52s -> 21447.88s]  This is just a Twitch rerun.
[21456.51s -> 21459.23s]  We're watching our own stream again and reacting to it.
[21459.23s -> 21461.31s]  Yeah, we're just re-watching the stream.
[21465.74s -> 21467.02s]  Okay, can he kill us?
[21467.02s -> 21483.47s]  If we make a bunch of noise, he's an actor.
[21485.50s -> 21486.30s]  Who's he talking to?
[21486.94s -> 21490.38s]  So this is the Conrad.
[21497.02s -> 21498.70s]  So this wasn't in the blast?
[21502.33s -> 21506.09s]  So am I the player that has to run away from you both at times in a row?
[21508.49s -> 21510.01s]  Are you doing this right now?
[21510.01s -> 21510.41s]  I guess.
[21511.69s -> 21514.25s]  Are you like invisible person?
[21516.65s -> 21517.77s]  And then I start running?
[21517.93s -> 21518.43s]  Hey!
[21524.33s -> 21524.97s]  You mentioned this.
[21524.97s -> 21528.33s]  I know like the hey are you Brad is the meme of this stream.
[21528.33s -> 21530.73s]  But if we were on the couch playing this together,
[21530.73s -> 21532.01s]  how the fuck would this play out?
[21532.96s -> 21535.28s]  Did Star just join the call?
[21540.14s -> 21540.46s]  No?
[21540.46s -> 21540.96s]  What?
[21546.33s -> 21548.89s]  That definitely sounded like a, you know.
[21550.60s -> 21554.48s]  If all of us were on the couch, we should test it out.
[21554.48s -> 21556.40s]  Let's go plug this in and go on the couch.
[21557.12s -> 21558.08s]  Playthrough number three.
[21567.50s -> 21570.06s]  Where is the weapon?
[21570.06s -> 21572.46s]  I have to have a weapon or else no one's going to die in this run.
[21573.42s -> 21575.07s]  Can't go that way.
[21577.79s -> 21579.47s]  I don't know where the weapon is.
[21586.68s -> 21590.92s]  There was no reason for him to be going insane the first playthrough.
[21590.92s -> 21592.60s]  He hadn't even seen anything scary.
[21592.60s -> 21593.88s]  But what happens?
[21594.92s -> 21597.16s]  So the game just doesn't want the two people
[21597.16s -> 21598.84s]  to really be in communication with each other?
[21598.84s -> 21599.64s]  Because obviously it's going to be-
[21599.64s -> 21603.24s]  I guess that's the whole point is like play co-op but don't talk to the other person.
[21603.24s -> 21606.68s]  Because then it's like, oh hey dude, are you like on the stairs?
[21606.68s -> 21607.00s]  No.
[21607.00s -> 21614.20s]  That's why a way out was so fun because you had to communicate until the end of the game.
[21614.20s -> 21616.20s]  And then it was like, all right, let's not talk to each other
[21616.20s -> 21618.20s]  because it's obvious we're not supposed to.
[21621.82s -> 21622.94s]  And then the game was over.
[21622.94s -> 21624.86s]  It's meant to be played online with strangers?
[21625.74s -> 21626.94s]  There's an invite button.
[21627.58s -> 21629.10s]  And don't play alone.
[21629.10s -> 21630.22s]  To your friends list.
[21635.47s -> 21636.67s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[21637.39s -> 21638.67s]  I like lost all track.
[21639.23s -> 21648.70s]  Is there a puzzle here?
[21649.74s -> 21650.94s]  Oh right, I gotta get that.
[21650.94s -> 21651.74s]  I forgot the key.
[21652.54s -> 21655.93s]  I think I have you trapped because I knew the key.
[21656.65s -> 21660.75s]  If there's a key, there's a lock.
[21666.52s -> 21667.80s]  I have to do something.
[21667.80s -> 21668.52s]  No, I do.
[21668.52s -> 21670.20s]  Because I'm like, I'm holding you back.
[21671.08s -> 21673.28s]  Well, I knew that.
[21673.28s -> 21676.17s]  But besides that, do I have to look for beer?
[21676.17s -> 21679.93s]  Why is she standing here?
[21679.93s -> 21684.80s]  There's no berries on the desk.
[21694.01s -> 21697.85s]  So you really are supposed to be like, hey man, you want to play Man of Medan?
[21697.85s -> 21698.49s]  Yeah.
[21698.49s -> 21699.85s]  Oh yeah, there's like a co-op mode.
[21699.85s -> 21700.33s]  It's cool.
[21701.37s -> 21703.29s]  Okay, I'll talk to you in like four hours.
[21705.37s -> 21705.93s]  Not that many.
[21707.13s -> 21712.30s]  Four is being very generous.
[21712.30s -> 21712.86s]  That is true.
[21713.98s -> 21715.18s]  All right, so I got the thing.
[21715.18s -> 21720.89s]  And now I have to forget like the progression here.
[21720.89s -> 21722.01s]  I can't leave from here?
[21724.73s -> 21727.61s]  I'm not sure if there's a moment in the game where you're waiting on me.
[21728.17s -> 21728.57s]  Am I?
[21729.21s -> 21741.02s]  Because I'm just kind of existing in this room.
[21741.98s -> 21745.20s]  Okay.
[21749.28s -> 21751.04s]  You eating a gogurt?
[21751.68s -> 21753.23s]  That's what it looked like.
[21759.56s -> 21760.60s]  Oh, where's the candle?
[21761.56s -> 21762.68s]  You, am I waiting for you?
[21763.40s -> 21765.16s]  Oh, the game showed me because I'm too dumb.
[21765.16s -> 21766.28s]  Now you're waiting for me.
[21766.28s -> 21766.92s]  Oh, okay.
[21769.69s -> 21771.13s]  I'm waiting for you to get a candle?
[21771.93s -> 21777.07s]  And it has to spook me.
[21786.08s -> 21786.64s]  What can I do here?
[21786.64s -> 21787.28s]  Can I look at this?
[21787.92s -> 21799.28s]  There ain't nothing on here.
[21800.51s -> 21801.79s]  Water purification.
[21803.39s -> 21806.44s]  Headed to San Francisco?
[21806.44s -> 21807.56s]  Berry's spotted.
[21808.44s -> 21811.88s]  I think if you play this in, um, what happens if I fail this QD?
[21812.76s -> 21813.16s]  Fail it.
[21815.79s -> 21820.38s]  Ah, was that me running after me into a room with me?
[21826.70s -> 21827.18s]  Right?
[21827.18s -> 21829.26s]  Okay, so we're currently...
[21834.22s -> 21834.86s]  There you are.
[21836.46s -> 21837.98s]  Why are you so sexy though?
[21837.98s -> 21839.42s]  You found me.
[21839.42s -> 21840.22s]  You found me.
[21841.63s -> 21842.43s]  Good work.
[21852.09s -> 21853.37s]  So what's happening on your side?
[21853.37s -> 21854.89s]  Are you just whispering in my ear?
[21854.89s -> 21857.69s]  No, you, I'm just standing completely still.
[21858.49s -> 21860.01s]  And you're scared of me.
[21861.72s -> 21863.72s]  Well, you're not standing completely still for me.
[21865.56s -> 21866.36s]  Just kill me.
[21869.64s -> 21870.52s]  Bart, get over here.
[21870.52s -> 21871.80s]  Here's a great QT's coming up.
[21874.44s -> 21874.94s]  Don't.
[21884.28s -> 21886.06s]  I won't, I get up.
[21886.78s -> 21887.28s]  He's just...
[21891.69s -> 21893.85s]  Hey, uh, you failed too many times.
[21893.85s -> 21894.89s]  So we gotta just throw you.
[21897.47s -> 21905.56s]  This is so, this is so funny.
[21908.54s -> 21909.82s]  It's me, it's Blitz.
[21912.06s -> 21913.58s]  Did I trap your hand in the door?
[21914.38s -> 21914.88s]  No.
[21915.74s -> 21919.02s]  Well then, what stopped the door?
[21919.82s -> 21920.70s]  You closed it.
[21921.58s -> 21922.06s]  You closed the door.
[21922.06s -> 21923.02s]  But your hand was in it.
[21923.02s -> 21924.30s]  Somebody's hand was in it.
[21926.43s -> 21927.39s]  Oh my god.
[21928.51s -> 21929.87s]  That was a fucking mess.
[21930.67s -> 21939.39s]  The game is having trouble trying to figure out where,
[21939.39s -> 21942.11s]  what to do because we're doing this so fucking wrong.
[21945.15s -> 21945.65s]  What?
[21946.35s -> 21947.95s]  Did you just teleport?
[21947.95s -> 21948.43s]  I just saw...
[21949.07s -> 21949.95s]  What is happening?
[21951.12s -> 21951.92s]  Did I just go in?
[21951.92s -> 21953.04s]  Hey, he's done it.
[21953.04s -> 21956.88s]  Ladies and gentlemen, all it took was seven failed QT's in a row.
[21966.80s -> 21969.31s]  Did you finally see the cut scene?
[21970.43s -> 21970.93s]  No.
[21972.27s -> 21973.39s]  The cut scene was amazing.
[21974.43s -> 21977.63s]  I looked down and you're just lying on your back.
[21978.59s -> 21980.19s]  You should see the, you should see the fall.
[21982.27s -> 21983.23s]  The fall was good.
[21983.87s -> 21985.39s]  Oh, my stomach.
[21985.39s -> 21987.39s]  I got first character kill.
[21987.39s -> 21992.83s]  I, oh my god.
[21993.79s -> 21997.69s]  All right, here we go.
[21998.33s -> 21999.07s]  Part two.
[22000.17s -> 22000.81s]  First blood.
[22010.84s -> 22011.34s]  He's here.
[22022.99s -> 22023.79s]  Through here, quick.
[22026.56s -> 22027.60s]  Hey, can you help me out?
[22030.00s -> 22030.80s]  Can you help me?
[22030.80s -> 22032.00s]  What was the point of that?
[22032.96s -> 22040.91s]  I didn't even, I didn't choose anything and I just helped you up anyway.
[22045.93s -> 22047.37s]  Run or jump or nothing?
[22047.37s -> 22048.25s]  Uh, neither.
[22051.15s -> 22051.87s]  Is he gone yet?
[22055.60s -> 22056.24s]  Did he just leave?
[22056.24s -> 22056.74s]  Nope.
[22059.56s -> 22060.68s]  Looks like we're jumping.
[22061.56s -> 22064.40s]  Hey, can you help me up again?
[22065.12s -> 22066.64s]  Nevermind, it looks like we're both down.
[22068.08s -> 22072.44s]  This is, to be fair, this is accurate to most horror movies though.
[22074.56s -> 22077.36s]  Yeah, but like failing every QTE is so difficult.
[22078.00s -> 22079.52s]  All he did is shove you down.
[22079.52s -> 22080.48s]  I thought, did he have a knife?
[22081.12s -> 22081.84s]  Where's his knife?
[22082.56s -> 22084.84s]  He just like checked you.
[22088.28s -> 22088.78s]  What?
[22089.72s -> 22091.08s]  He was in the room with us.
[22092.94s -> 22094.94s]  He walked inside of the room with us.
[22095.74s -> 22101.56s]  Yeah, it's me, come on, let's go.
[22104.04s -> 22105.96s]  Yeah, it's me, come on, let's go.
[22110.36s -> 22112.44s]  They played the stair cutscene twice.
[22113.64s -> 22127.26s]  All right, can they start dropping like flies here?
[22127.26s -> 22127.76s]  Let's see.
[22133.15s -> 22135.71s]  Imagine playing a horror game and you have to google how to die.
[22137.02s -> 22137.52s]  I think.
[22138.46s -> 22139.42s]  I know, right?
[22139.42s -> 22140.22s]  We'll be all right here.
[22142.86s -> 22144.06s]  Three people could be dead right now.
[22144.06s -> 22145.74s]  How could you fuck this up so badly?
[22145.74s -> 22151.31s]  We've failed every QTE and made every horrible decision.
[22153.04s -> 22156.26s]  Including not making decisions.
[22156.26s -> 22161.54s]  Things appear to have taken a turn towards the spiritual, wouldn't you say?
[22161.54s -> 22166.50s]  I think this game just rewards an indecisive characteristic.
[22166.82s -> 22172.18s]  If you just don't ever make any choices in your own life, everything will work itself out.
[22172.18s -> 22175.30s]  I was really hoping there was going to be like a bottle of alcohol in this book.
[22175.30s -> 22180.34s]  He, or rather you, should have been a bit less careless.
[22181.38s -> 22184.96s]  Have you figured out what's going on?
[22185.52s -> 22186.80s]  How to stop it?
[22186.80s -> 22190.40s]  How to save the lives of your poor unfortunate stowaways?
[22190.40s -> 22193.28s]  The poor unfortunate stowaways are chat at this point.
[22194.24s -> 22196.64s]  We're trying to save their lives by getting everyone killed.
[22198.40s -> 22204.10s]  The deaths that night.
[22204.10s -> 22205.54s]  Let me help you out.
[22205.54s -> 22206.82s]  Give you a little hint.
[22206.82s -> 22207.14s]  Please.
[22209.63s -> 22212.35s]  I still don't understand what's happening.
[22212.35s -> 22213.87s]  Are we looking for gold still?
[22213.87s -> 22215.15s]  You're a gold bars.
[22216.67s -> 22217.55s]  Who's the monster?
[22218.19s -> 22220.59s]  Well, then how are you?
[22220.59s -> 22223.39s]  Are you actually the maybe forces at play here?
[22223.39s -> 22224.91s]  Are you imitating chat?
[22224.91s -> 22225.39s]  Sign.
[22225.39s -> 22225.95s]  I'm asking.
[22225.95s -> 22229.87s]  I'm asking if it's even some of the more I don't understand.
[22229.87s -> 22232.99s]  I mean, that's supernatural.
[22235.70s -> 22238.34s]  Perhaps you've started to realize something.
[22240.94s -> 22241.58s]  Everything.
[22241.58s -> 22244.22s]  Perhaps you're starting to realize berries.
[22244.22s -> 22246.22s]  May not be quite what they appear to be.
[22247.66s -> 22252.42s]  I hope that helps.
[22252.42s -> 22255.78s]  Well, aren't you excited to find out what the poor unfortunate
[22255.78s -> 22261.30s]  for making of all this and how you might avoid any more unnecessary tragedy?
[22261.30s -> 22262.58s]  Nothing is as it seems.
[22263.94s -> 22265.14s]  Everything you see is a lie.
[22266.59s -> 22269.07s]  It's like very on the nose.
[22270.78s -> 22272.14s]  Everything's a lie.
[22272.14s -> 22273.02s]  Everything's a lie.
[22274.70s -> 22277.04s]  Okay, I cannot.
[22277.04s -> 22277.44s]  You know what?
[22277.44s -> 22278.32s]  I'm going to be real with you.
[22278.32s -> 22281.52s]  I really can't fucking believe it's the only way we can explain all this.
[22281.52s -> 22283.52s]  We have done this whole thing again.
[22283.52s -> 22287.28s]  I thought it was going to be like five people die on the boat or something.
[22287.28s -> 22289.20s]  Okay, we're about to do the whole thing.
[22290.88s -> 22296.88s]  Only one person per chapter can die because you have to code all those outcomes.
[22298.16s -> 22300.94s]  Yeah, but just for a second, I tried to catch up.
[22301.10s -> 22302.62s]  You can only die when you're allowed to die.
[22303.66s -> 22304.54s]  Why this?
[22304.54s -> 22305.50s]  This just doesn't add up.
[22311.14s -> 22312.58s]  Should have switched character.
[22312.58s -> 22317.54s]  I think there's a common misconception that if a character lives or dies,
[22317.54s -> 22320.74s]  that's the only indicator of a choices matter game.
[22321.38s -> 22324.34s]  The real thing is we're not even making choices.
[22327.30s -> 22328.10s]  You know what I'm saying?
[22328.10s -> 22331.62s]  Like we haven't chosen to do anything.
[22333.62s -> 22335.14s]  Okay, we're going back right now.
[22335.14s -> 22337.94s]  So I don't care if they haven't died by now.
[22337.94s -> 22343.94s]  I care because we just didn't play like we what the fuck is going on with this ship?
[22343.94s -> 22345.94s]  That's funny because I got to be honest.
[22345.94s -> 22350.50s]  It feels like there's some like like evil, like you chose not to play the game.
[22350.50s -> 22351.22s]  That's true.
[22351.22s -> 22353.14s]  Let's just stay calm and relative.
[22353.14s -> 22354.42s]  I'm talking about the first playthrough.
[22354.42s -> 22356.74s]  Okay, that's stuff I saw.
[22357.70s -> 22359.78s]  It's like there were these old soldiers that they were.
[22359.78s -> 22361.14s]  There's never like two paths.
[22361.14s -> 22362.50s]  Which one do you want to do?
[22362.58s -> 22366.42s]  That doesn't that actually they all lead to the same thing.
[22366.42s -> 22368.98s]  Now, it seems the only Alex.
[22368.98s -> 22369.86s]  What are you talking about?
[22370.42s -> 22374.98s]  There were things walking around with his face on them about his face.
[22374.98s -> 22377.46s]  He was it's horrifying faces.
[22377.46s -> 22378.74s]  Alex is so ugly.
[22379.46s -> 22380.66s]  What the fuck?
[22381.22s -> 22382.34s]  Why did you say that about me?
[22383.76s -> 22385.28s]  Sorry, I'm just parroting the last stream.
[22385.28s -> 22386.24s]  This is the second stream.
[22386.96s -> 22391.71s]  Maybe like one thing could but not all of these crazy things.
[22392.27s -> 22393.47s]  It's too much of a coincidence.
[22394.11s -> 22396.53s]  There's got to be something going on here.
[22397.25s -> 22398.94s]  What can we absolutely be sure about?
[22399.82s -> 22400.78s]  What do we know that's real?
[22401.50s -> 22409.34s]  We're wasting time.
[22409.34s -> 22410.86s]  Whatever we do, we have to do it now.
[22411.50s -> 22412.54s]  Time to get off this ship.
[22413.26s -> 22415.74s]  We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.
[22415.74s -> 22417.10s]  The Duke needs it to run.
[22417.10s -> 22418.30s]  What's the next stream tomorrow?
[22419.58s -> 22421.18s]  This ship's got to have a radio.
[22425.18s -> 22425.82s]  That's great.
[22425.82s -> 22427.10s]  But do you think it still works?
[22428.06s -> 22428.86s]  Streaming tomorrow.
[22430.14s -> 22437.22s]  So we have to go through this again.
[22441.17s -> 22444.21s]  Is there like a way I can I can I just like get off this damn ship?
[22445.49s -> 22445.97s]  No shit.
[22446.77s -> 22449.17s]  I think we're speaking clinically.
[22449.89s -> 22450.93s]  Speedruns going pretty good.
[22450.93s -> 22452.93s]  So the speedrun is going really good so far.
[22453.89s -> 22455.33s]  We might set a new world first.
[22456.13s -> 22464.83s]  Why are they doing this again?
[22464.83s -> 22465.63s]  I just got here.
[22467.09s -> 22467.73s]  You just got here.
[22467.73s -> 22468.77s]  How do you know we're doing it again?
[22470.58s -> 22471.08s]  Uh-oh.
[22482.91s -> 22483.71s]  Find the radio.
[22484.35s -> 22493.10s]  Find a way up.
[22493.10s -> 22493.66s]  All right.
[22493.66s -> 22494.30s]  It's around here.
[22497.25s -> 22498.21s]  Just follow me.
[22498.21s -> 22499.25s]  I know where it is, Zephyr.
[22507.41s -> 22509.17s]  I did the same thing last time.
[22510.48s -> 22511.04s]  What did you do?
[22511.76s -> 22512.00s]  Right?
[22512.00s -> 22512.72s]  Did I?
[22512.72s -> 22513.60s]  I did the same thing.
[22514.62s -> 22519.79s]  I leaned over on the side of the chair and that got hurt again.
[22519.79s -> 22521.63s]  Like I moved too far over to my right.
[22521.63s -> 22522.99s]  Why did I do that twice?
[22523.87s -> 22527.60s]  This is freaking me out.
[22527.60s -> 22528.64s]  This is actually getting in my head.
[22528.64s -> 22529.20s]  I'll pull you up.
[22530.08s -> 22534.08s]  Is there some gas coming in that I need to be aware of?
[22535.68s -> 22537.76s]  Maybe it's the amount of time that we've been in the game.
[22537.76s -> 22539.60s]  I leaned over on the right.
[22539.60s -> 22545.50s]  And if I lean too hard, my right arm rest will move.
[22545.50s -> 22547.18s]  And it kind of catches me sometimes.
[22547.18s -> 22549.42s]  And I hurt my fucking elbow.
[22552.29s -> 22553.65s]  Someone is teleporting.
[22560.27s -> 22561.79s]  Do a deep sniff.
[22568.74s -> 22572.75s]  This is where I chased comrades before.
[22573.39s -> 22573.71s]  Yeah.
[22584.56s -> 22585.28s]  Okay.
[22585.28s -> 22586.40s]  We're almost at the end of the game.
[22589.65s -> 22590.21s]  Over here.
[22590.21s -> 22591.01s]  We do the radio.
[22592.85s -> 22594.61s]  And then that's like the final scene.
[22595.57s -> 22597.02s]  Got to wait through here.
[22600.96s -> 22605.76s]  The way we've been playing has been making the characters glitch around my game.
[22606.56s -> 22607.87s]  Oh, I'm certain of it.
[22610.66s -> 22612.90s]  Because I'm hosting this, right?
[22613.78s -> 22620.26s]  So that means that I'm dumping data into your computer's brain and it can't take it.
[22621.74s -> 22623.58s]  Because it's just all these things are happening too quickly.
[22627.36s -> 22627.92s]  Loading in.
[22628.48s -> 22633.31s]  Okay.
[22633.31s -> 22635.63s]  Let's go find the radio.
[22635.63s -> 22636.67s]  Should I scream?
[22636.67s -> 22637.79s]  Should I just say nothing?
[22640.10s -> 22641.78s]  Say nothing to the radio.
[22642.42s -> 22643.06s]  Where is it?
[22643.06s -> 22643.62s]  It's in here, right?
[22644.26s -> 22650.96s]  What are you doing?
[22650.96s -> 22657.34s]  What's my character doing?
[22657.34s -> 22657.90s]  Scream?
[22657.90s -> 22662.62s]  No, I'm not going to say anything because that tells them that there's people here.
[22662.62s -> 22663.74s]  Maybe they won't show up at the end.
[22664.46s -> 22671.25s]  Where is this damn radio?
[22676.64s -> 22677.63s]  I remember that.
[22677.63s -> 22679.71s]  No, but there's gotta be a radio on this ship.
[22679.71s -> 22680.51s]  They're...
[22680.51s -> 22690.38s]  Okay, it's about the lore.
[22690.38s -> 22692.06s]  Radio is back here, right?
[22692.06s -> 22692.30s]  Yeah.
[22693.26s -> 22695.26s]  And then it's Mayday, Mayday.
[22698.11s -> 22702.27s]  Do you think it's easier to navigate your character in this game or Resident Evil 1
[22702.27s -> 22703.55s]  on original console?
[22704.51s -> 22705.23s]  That's Tasa.
[22705.23s -> 22706.59s]  No freaking way.
[22707.15s -> 22708.67s]  This thing actually still works?
[22709.63s -> 22716.21s]  Wait, I'm doing this this time?
[22718.45s -> 22719.89s]  Good old shortwave radio.
[22722.72s -> 22724.00s]  Resident Evil 1.
[22724.00s -> 22725.12s]  It's a number station.
[22727.58s -> 22728.62s]  Military bandwidth.
[22728.62s -> 22731.26s]  Okay, let's ask something else.
[22732.51s -> 22734.35s]  Yeah, we don't know the name of the ship.
[22734.35s -> 22735.31s]  Therefore, we're not given...
[22735.31s -> 22736.11s]  Come in, please.
[22736.91s -> 22737.87s]  Do you read us?
[22738.67s -> 22738.99s]  Over.
[22746.34s -> 22748.58s]  Okay, at least there's someone listening.
[22748.58s -> 22749.62s]  The signal's in and out, though.
[22761.46s -> 22762.98s]  Listen, that was our only chance.
[22764.50s -> 22767.68s]  What's wrong with you?
[22767.68s -> 22774.24s]  Imagine being kidnapped, abducted, held hostage, torn onto a ghost boat against your will.
[22774.88s -> 22776.56s]  You get a working radio.
[22776.56s -> 22778.00s]  You say nothing.
[22778.00s -> 22780.64s]  No, at that point, that's when one of the characters just starts laughing.
[22780.64s -> 22782.16s]  This has got to lead somewhere.
[22782.16s -> 22783.44s]  Maybe we can find a way to get the power back.
[22783.44s -> 22784.72s]  I can't believe it.
[22784.72s -> 22785.76s]  We need to get that radio working.
[22785.76s -> 22786.72s]  Unbelievable.
[22786.72s -> 22788.08s]  I think someone should wait here in case our message comes a dream.
[22788.08s -> 22790.48s]  What else can go wrong today?
[22790.48s -> 22791.60s]  Obviously.
[22791.60s -> 22792.80s]  I can do this.
[22792.80s -> 22793.76s]  I should be the one to go.
[22794.80s -> 22796.24s]  No clowns in this game, either.
[22797.36s -> 22798.94s]  Except for all the main characters, but...
[22800.98s -> 22801.94s]  That's it, then.
[22801.94s -> 22802.82s]  I'm going.
[22802.82s -> 22803.54s]  I'm coming, too.
[22803.54s -> 22804.50s]  Actors, I like you.
[22805.06s -> 22805.86s]  Really? No.
[22805.86s -> 22806.90s]  You're not my bodyguard.
[22806.90s -> 22807.46s]  It's not your fault.
[22807.46s -> 22808.58s]  I'll take care of myself.
[22808.58s -> 22816.74s]  Then that's that.
[22816.74s -> 22817.54s]  I'm going.
[22817.54s -> 22818.70s]  Okay, Julia.
[22818.70s -> 22819.98s]  We got the same outcome.
[22819.98s -> 22820.70s]  Fuck.
[22820.70s -> 22822.30s]  We should have said, let me go.
[22823.34s -> 22825.66s]  We've done the same outcome.
[22825.66s -> 22826.46s]  The same thing.
[22829.50s -> 22831.04s]  The same run.
[22831.68s -> 22834.72s]  The only thing that's changed is you T-Posed on the ground.
[22836.08s -> 22837.84s]  We're doomed to repeat history.
[22840.56s -> 22850.22s]  Oh, we have to try to get shot by that guy, right?
[22851.26s -> 22855.39s]  Keep telling him that there's no mist.
[22855.39s -> 22856.43s]  Just be like, what are you talking about?
[22856.83s -> 22857.79s]  I see the mist.
[22857.79s -> 22858.43s]  There is no mist.
[22859.15s -> 22865.57s]  What are we going to do?
[22866.85s -> 22876.16s]  We'll wait here by the radiant.
[22876.16s -> 22876.96s]  He thinks we're dead.
[22876.96s -> 22878.64s]  We're just embarrassed, okay?
[22878.64s -> 22879.14s]  Gosh.
[22880.08s -> 22883.60s]  I can't believe we just said it with such confidence and gusto
[22883.60s -> 22885.68s]  that we were going to be the ones to jump down there.
[22885.68s -> 22886.64s]  And then we just...
[22886.64s -> 22887.52s]  I don't know, guys.
[22887.52s -> 22889.04s]  I was expecting a different outcome.
[22890.08s -> 22890.58s]  Hey.
[22891.20s -> 22892.08s]  That's so stupid.
[22896.06s -> 22896.56s]  Bubbles.
[22897.26s -> 22899.16s]  After you.
[22900.02s -> 22903.38s]  Okay.
[22904.24s -> 22904.74s]  Straight.
[22905.68s -> 22906.18s]  Forward.
[22907.55s -> 22908.05s]  Forward.
[22908.05s -> 22908.55s]  Left.
[22908.99s -> 22910.59s]  Hug the corners.
[22910.59s -> 22911.15s]  Save time.
[22911.71s -> 22912.21s]  Okay.
[22914.93s -> 22915.65s]  Your cameras.
[22915.65s -> 22916.37s]  I still see you.
[22917.33s -> 22917.83s]  That's me.
[22918.69s -> 22919.65s]  That's me.
[22919.65s -> 22921.01s]  I thought that I was Brad.
[22922.46s -> 22923.50s]  Eat the food on the cart.
[22924.06s -> 22930.96s]  You missed the food.
[22930.96s -> 22931.46s]  Go back.
[22935.25s -> 22936.13s]  Hey, are you Brad?
[22936.85s -> 22939.09s]  You missed this food that you missed on the cart.
[22940.53s -> 22941.33s]  Gold on table.
[22945.04s -> 22946.96s]  Look, it's different down there.
[22946.96s -> 22951.38s]  Looks like the engine room.
[22951.38s -> 22952.90s]  Good place to find the generator, right?
[22959.84s -> 22960.96s]  The ladder's broken off here.
[22962.00s -> 22963.90s]  I think I can just...
[22964.54s -> 22965.04s]  Wait.
[22966.70s -> 22967.26s]  Are you okay?
[22968.72s -> 22969.22s]  Yeah.
[22969.22s -> 22970.96s]  You know when you love a movie so much?
[22970.96s -> 22971.46s]  Okay.
[22971.46s -> 22972.32s]  Just come down.
[22972.32s -> 22972.96s]  In the theater.
[22973.68s -> 22975.68s]  And you're out of the seat.
[22975.68s -> 22977.20s]  That was so good.
[22977.20s -> 22979.52s]  That was the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
[22979.52s -> 22980.88s]  Let's go watch it again.
[22980.88s -> 22981.36s]  Right now.
[22981.36s -> 22982.96s]  Let's get in there and watch it right now.
[22982.96s -> 22984.64s]  You go to the next show and you move.
[22984.64s -> 22985.36s]  Oh, God.
[22985.36s -> 22985.84s]  What's up?
[22985.84s -> 22986.34s]  That...
[22986.88s -> 22987.52s]  It was...
[22987.52s -> 22988.72s]  Why are we doing this?
[22988.72s -> 22989.84s]  We didn't like this movie.
[22989.84s -> 22991.84s]  Are you hearing my jokes, like, on a delay?
[22992.48s -> 22992.98s]  What?
[22994.00s -> 22994.50s]  I...
[22994.50s -> 22996.64s]  When we first started it, I said that.
[22998.32s -> 22998.82s]  You did?
[22999.36s -> 22999.86s]  Yeah.
[23004.03s -> 23004.67s]  Were you muted?
[23005.79s -> 23006.29s]  No.
[23007.63s -> 23012.59s]  I said, uh, hey, projector boy fell asleep and he forgot to run the audio.
[23012.59s -> 23013.79s]  So we were all being silent.
[23015.36s -> 23017.04s]  But we're seeing the second showing in the evening.
[23018.72s -> 23019.92s]  When did you say it?
[23019.92s -> 23021.04s]  It's a theory, I guess.
[23021.92s -> 23022.42s]  Oh, God.
[23023.74s -> 23024.38s]  All right.
[23024.38s -> 23025.10s]  Let's get going.
[23026.46s -> 23027.42s]  That's not the same joke.
[23028.72s -> 23029.20s]  If they take...
[23029.20s -> 23030.72s]  They both take place in a movie theater.
[23031.74s -> 23036.46s]  I said it's like when a big movie opens and there's a second evening showing.
[23040.82s -> 23042.10s]  That's basically the same thing.
[23046.08s -> 23048.08s]  Except in this one, we're being silent.
[23048.08s -> 23049.44s]  Well, get fucking plagiarized.
[23051.90s -> 23053.74s]  Does that mean that I wasn't listening to you?
[23059.92s -> 23061.20s]  Can you walk forward?
[23061.84s -> 23066.58s]  I can't...
[23066.58s -> 23068.02s]  I don't know where I'm going.
[23072.78s -> 23074.70s]  Please move your character.
[23074.70s -> 23085.09s]  Hey, it's the rebreather.
[23085.09s -> 23088.03s]  The fisherman must have bothered over from the Duke of Milan.
[23088.59s -> 23090.03s]  You think it still works?
[23090.03s -> 23091.71s]  Looks like it's got a little juice left.
[23091.71s -> 23092.59s]  Maybe a couple of minutes.
[23093.23s -> 23094.11s]  Should we bring it with us?
[23094.11s -> 23094.83s]  I mean, it's heavy.
[23105.10s -> 23106.94s]  I don't even know what you decided there.
[23108.54s -> 23110.13s]  All right, this is important.
[23110.13s -> 23110.63s]  This is important.
[23111.81s -> 23112.31s]  Get shot.
[23124.86s -> 23134.94s]  It's the mist.
[23135.92s -> 23136.88s]  The mist is doing it.
[23152.05s -> 23155.57s]  Yeah, we have to tell him that we have been breathing this mist all day.
[23157.01s -> 23159.49s]  Just be like, oh yeah, we've been breathing it in.
[23159.49s -> 23160.45s]  We breathe it in every day.
[23161.33s -> 23167.79s]  I think we messed it up pretty bad last time.
[23167.79s -> 23169.87s]  I don't know how to do it any worse.
[23170.59s -> 23176.37s]  The way to do it is to keep saying that you breathed in the mist.
[23178.29s -> 23179.73s]  So like actually have to try.
[23187.39s -> 23188.67s]  Why would he scream at us?
[23188.67s -> 23192.93s]  Because keep saying that there is no mist.
[23197.18s -> 23199.58s]  Okay, so we have to keep telling this guy that there's no mist.
[23199.58s -> 23202.06s]  There's no mist hiding, you little foots.
[23202.06s -> 23207.23s]  And we're sharing all that gold, huh?
[23207.23s -> 23211.26s]  There must be plenty of that.
[23211.26s -> 23213.31s]  Wait, here it comes.
[23225.50s -> 23227.02s]  Oh no, he didn't say the line.
[23228.78s -> 23234.82s]  It's like Scooby Doo.
[23242.24s -> 23247.09s]  Okay, quick thinking.
[23247.09s -> 23248.13s]  Please tell me we're safe.
[23249.41s -> 23250.80s]  Yeah, totally.
[23251.44s -> 23256.29s]  I mean, these doors are vented with stand also stuff.
[23259.20s -> 23269.42s]  Okay, so we have to say the mist is fake.
[23270.86s -> 23271.58s]  You're stupid.
[23271.58s -> 23272.62s]  The mist is not real.
[23273.90s -> 23276.98s]  There's no mist.
[23280.00s -> 23285.58s]  Okay, say you breathe it in and then say it's not real.
[23287.95s -> 23288.75s]  Raise your hands up.
[23296.18s -> 23296.98s]  No changing.
[23303.30s -> 23305.06s]  Just put the gun down.
[23305.95s -> 23307.39s]  Nobody has to get hurt.
[23307.39s -> 23309.95s]  I bet being completely silent here is the optimal.
[23313.23s -> 23316.27s]  We have to tell them that there's no such thing as a mist.
[23317.39s -> 23318.51s]  I picked the worst option.
[23324.43s -> 23326.03s]  There's the Aria monsters thing.
[23333.01s -> 23334.21s]  What did you just say?
[23336.45s -> 23340.53s]  What mist?
[23341.33s -> 23345.57s]  What's going on?
[23345.57s -> 23346.05s]  Is this me?
[23348.21s -> 23348.69s]  That was you.
[23348.69s -> 23350.21s]  Yeah, I couldn't control it.
[23372.05s -> 23373.33s]  Which one do I do?
[23373.33s -> 23375.09s]  I think we're supposed to say that it's not real.
[23375.09s -> 23376.53s]  Like he's like crazy or something.
[23377.86s -> 23378.66s]  There's no mist.
[23395.30s -> 23396.34s]  There's no mist.
[23396.34s -> 23397.30s]  What are you talking about?
[23404.83s -> 23405.39s]  There it is.
[23414.67s -> 23416.03s]  Why would he shoot her?
[23418.19s -> 23420.75s]  And not the guy who's like there's no mist, dude.
[23421.87s -> 23424.91s]  Hey, dude, what are you talking about?
[23424.91s -> 23428.67s]  I am effectively telling you, me, that you're wrong.
[23428.67s -> 23430.51s]  I'm gonna shoot the person fucking next to you.
[23430.51s -> 23433.31s]  Like unabashedly out of your mind.
[23433.31s -> 23434.91s]  I'm basically calling you crazy.
[23434.91s -> 23436.99s]  I am essentially saying, hey, shoot me, please.
[23436.99s -> 23438.11s]  I would like you to do it.
[23439.23s -> 23439.95s]  That girl.
[23440.51s -> 23445.55s]  Don't worry, just raise her head.
[23447.07s -> 23449.39s]  She comes back the next scene with like a bandage around her head.
[23457.04s -> 23458.72s]  He was just trying to scare her.
[23465.44s -> 23468.08s]  Okay, so here's the opportunity for us to screw this up somehow.
[23470.66s -> 23471.94s]  Well, we already know what happens here.
[23481.60s -> 23482.10s]  Do we?
[23486.40s -> 23490.38s]  Better choreography than Game of Thrones.
[23516.03s -> 23516.83s]  Who was that?
[23527.57s -> 23534.14s]  Over here.
[23534.14s -> 23535.50s]  This must have been what we just heard.
[23536.62s -> 23546.45s]  Doesn't matter.
[23546.45s -> 23547.81s]  We need that distributor cap.
[23549.01s -> 23550.77s]  So this time I'm gonna kill you.
[23552.29s -> 23566.74s]  Brad is invincible.
[23567.38s -> 23568.26s]  Brad is invincible.
[23570.42s -> 23571.54s]  Brad is invincible?
[23572.42s -> 23572.74s]  I mean.
[23573.62s -> 23574.74s]  Are you Brad?
[23574.74s -> 23575.24s]  No.
[23586.27s -> 23587.07s]  All right.
[23587.07s -> 23591.95s]  Is this like a bad guy in the game or is this like a Diablo 3 loot goblin?
[23594.40s -> 23596.48s]  He's he's just like, oh, I fuck.
[23597.04s -> 23597.76s]  Oh, no.
[23597.76s -> 23600.16s]  I pressed the button supposed to be running away from him.
[23600.16s -> 23601.68s]  It feels like we're chasing him.
[23602.88s -> 23606.40s]  My brain turned off and I just like did the QTE.
[23607.36s -> 23611.76s]  Well, you did the QTE.
[23611.76s -> 23613.52s]  I did the I did the first QTE.
[23618.62s -> 23619.58s]  I don't think it matters though.
[23625.84s -> 23626.64s]  No, it doesn't matter.
[23639.34s -> 23639.98s]  I'll follow him.
[23639.98s -> 23642.94s]  I'll just find the little gold coins that are in a trail.
[23643.90s -> 23647.82s]  Does anything matter when we saw that everyone gets gunned down at the end?
[23647.82s -> 23649.02s]  Unless you fix the boat.
[23649.82s -> 23650.75s]  That is true.
[23653.89s -> 23656.13s]  There's one choice that really matters.
[23657.17s -> 23661.57s]  And it's up to you to save the piece of equipment.
[23661.57s -> 23663.73s]  I'm not gonna make this jump, Alex.
[23663.73s -> 23665.25s]  I'll have to find another way around.
[23665.25s -> 23666.53s]  And then I'm gonna stab you.
[23667.17s -> 23675.07s]  But then how do you die?
[23675.07s -> 23676.51s]  Because you killed yourself last time.
[23679.04s -> 23680.16s]  Uh, that's it.
[23680.16s -> 23680.96s]  I don't know.
[23680.96s -> 23682.64s]  Then I would just I just get gunned down.
[23686.02s -> 23687.70s]  My control is like fucking broken.
[23688.34s -> 23692.78s]  What the hell is going on with this thing?
[23692.78s -> 23699.04s]  I've seen this one before.
[23699.76s -> 23701.87s]  I have an actual headache.
[23703.90s -> 23704.78s]  Like in real life?
[23705.34s -> 23707.90s]  Yeah, from this video game.
[23708.70s -> 23712.26s]  Oh shit.
[23712.98s -> 23716.03s]  I think I think the miss is seeping through.
[23716.03s -> 23718.96s]  Well, we're almost done.
[23719.98s -> 23721.50s]  We're almost done completely.
[23722.06s -> 23724.90s]  So, um, who's left to kill?
[23726.02s -> 23728.64s]  Wait, can I just get eaten by rats?
[23729.44s -> 23730.24s]  Fuck.
[23730.32s -> 23733.68s]  So do we want the everyone dies to gunfire at the end or no?
[23734.40s -> 23737.31s]  Well, it's only gonna be like two or three.
[23737.87s -> 23740.27s]  But you're like, yes or no, because I have to choose now.
[23740.27s -> 23742.27s]  Uh, may as well just get us all killed.
[23743.07s -> 23749.58s]  Because didn't we already go back and do this the right way?
[23749.58s -> 23750.08s]  We did.
[23752.37s -> 23756.22s]  We've seen both of those endings already.
[23756.22s -> 23759.89s]  However, really a choice that I made right there.
[23763.76s -> 23764.48s]  Oh, no.
[23766.26s -> 23769.14s]  Like, did I make a choice or did I just try to open a door?
[23772.02s -> 23772.52s]  Okay.
[23780.37s -> 23789.06s]  I'm gonna try to be as menacing as possible.
[23789.06s -> 23790.18s]  Wait, why are you different?
[23793.33s -> 23793.97s]  Am I different?
[23793.97s -> 23795.17s]  You're a different monster.
[23796.13s -> 23799.17s]  Alex, it's me.
[23799.17s -> 23799.67s]  What?
[23803.41s -> 23804.69s]  It's a different person.
[23805.33s -> 23815.90s]  Put the knife down.
[23815.90s -> 23816.40s]  What?
[23816.86s -> 23820.77s]  So what was the...
[23820.77s -> 23823.17s]  I gotta watch to see what monster I was.
[23823.17s -> 23826.05s]  You were like a two-headed, a great show.
[23828.74s -> 23829.94s]  Now you're just the...
[23829.94s -> 23830.98s]  Give me the knife, okay?
[23830.98s -> 23831.78s]  The captain guy.
[23831.78s -> 23833.06s]  Give me the knife.
[23833.06s -> 23833.56s]  Olsen.
[23852.48s -> 23854.00s]  All right, now what happens if I stop?
[23854.00s -> 23855.04s]  What happens if I stop now?
[23855.76s -> 23856.48s]  You're still going.
[23857.28s -> 23860.16s]  But if I stop...
[23867.98s -> 23870.22s]  You went right for center mass with at least one of those.
[23870.22s -> 23870.72s]  I did?
[23871.50s -> 23872.00s]  Yeah.
[23884.70s -> 23885.66s]  Oh, right.
[23885.66s -> 23890.19s]  The reason you didn't see the two-headed monster is because, uh...
[23892.42s -> 23899.14s]  When I was playing as Alex, we had found the two-headed monster in one of the coffins.
[23899.14s -> 23900.74s]  So it was in his imagination.
[23900.74s -> 23901.54s]  That's right.
[23901.54s -> 23902.04s]  Oh.
[23903.28s -> 23904.40s]  This time we speed ran.
[23905.20s -> 23925.55s]  All right.
[23925.55s -> 23927.02s]  We did it.
[23927.02s -> 23927.90s]  We did it as...
[23929.34s -> 23931.18s]  We've played through the game twice.
[23931.18s -> 23932.86s]  We've played through the whole game two times.
[23933.50s -> 23937.73s]  I mean, played is very loosely stated.
[23938.69s -> 23939.89s]  So now what happens if...
[23939.89s -> 23941.97s]  Because we didn't tell anybody on the radio where we were.
[23946.38s -> 23946.88s]  We did.
[23947.58s -> 23949.42s]  Yeah, we just locked up.
[23950.22s -> 23955.50s]  So if nobody knows where we are on the radio, then we just live here now.
[23957.84s -> 23959.52s]  Brothers till the end.
[23960.16s -> 23986.93s]  Guess we're not going anywhere on the duke.
[23987.89s -> 23989.33s]  Pretty much stuck here.
[23989.89s -> 23992.14s]  What a way to go.
[23998.46s -> 23999.66s]  Starving to death.
[23999.66s -> 24002.30s]  Wait, what do you mean, what a way to go?
[24002.30s -> 24002.86s]  And that's it?
[24004.06s -> 24006.38s]  There's no food.
[24006.38s -> 24007.26s]  There's just people.
[24007.26s -> 24008.62s]  They could resort to cannibalism.
[24009.66s -> 24012.54s]  By a little time.
[24012.54s -> 24016.54s]  Maybe some old crates got some potatoes in cans or something.
[24016.54s -> 24017.04s]  I don't know.
[24019.09s -> 24019.59s]  Yeah, I mean...
[24019.59s -> 24022.82s]  I think, uh, I think I'm gonna go back in.
[24026.59s -> 24027.09s]  No way.
[24027.09s -> 24030.93s]  Hey, there's gotta be some food somewhere in there, right?
[24031.65s -> 24036.20s]  Ashes, cans, whatever's in there.
[24037.32s -> 24038.44s]  It's not worth getting.
[24039.00s -> 24040.12s]  We're gonna starve out here.
[24041.32s -> 24044.55s]  I'm gonna try to get the Duke of Milan out to sea.
[24044.55s -> 24045.11s]  Make a boat.
[24045.99s -> 24046.71s]  Take those crates.
[24047.43s -> 24049.86s]  How are you gonna do that with no engine?
[24051.19s -> 24053.91s]  Yeah, well, nowhere is better than this fucking ship.
[24054.63s -> 24057.75s]  That's it, Ben.
[24061.56s -> 24063.16s]  Are we saying goodbye to each other?
[24064.72s -> 24065.84s]  Why aren't we doing this together?
[24066.88s -> 24067.92s]  Um, I don't know.
[24067.92s -> 24071.12s]  It's odd to me that these two brothers just escaped
[24071.12s -> 24074.64s]  their own version of hell and are instantly separating.
[24075.20s -> 24076.32s]  I'm coming back for you.
[24076.32s -> 24077.52s]  Why are you not going?
[24077.52s -> 24078.08s]  What are you doing?
[24078.96s -> 24082.87s]  He's just gonna live on the ship and eat, I guess.
[24083.91s -> 24089.24s]  For you to do that, you'd have to assume the other person's absolutely dead,
[24089.24s -> 24090.52s]  but you fist bumped at the end.
[24090.52s -> 24092.36s]  So you just don't care that they're gonna die?
[24100.74s -> 24106.60s]  To go back in here for any reason.
[24106.60s -> 24113.14s]  I don't know.
[24113.14s -> 24115.54s]  Okay, there's only one other person here that can kill him.
[24120.24s -> 24125.89s]  Wait, we didn't have any food on the boat?
[24126.45s -> 24129.33s]  Imagine if two people were rowing this massive boat.
[24129.97s -> 24132.44s]  There's a whole downstairs kitchen.
[24139.35s -> 24140.31s]  It's Gendry.
[24152.39s -> 24156.55s]  He's just running around in a circle in like the crazy drug ship.
[24156.55s -> 24159.35s]  All right, now for the post credit where the dude wakes up
[24159.35s -> 24162.79s]  and I guess presumably kills Alex because the helicopter shouldn't be coming.
[24166.48s -> 24169.12s]  Yeah, there's gonna be a Danny versus Alex.
[24169.12s -> 24171.52s]  At least there was actually a different ending.
[24171.52s -> 24173.20s]  Drugged out fight, yeah.
[24173.20s -> 24174.88s]  Which makes it better than Blair Witch.
[24182.15s -> 24186.18s]  Which also says choices matter at the beginning of the game.
[24187.06s -> 24187.94s]  That's it.
[24187.94s -> 24188.98s]  Game over.
[24188.98s -> 24189.54s]  You're done.
[24190.26s -> 24191.14s]  For now, at least.
[24191.86s -> 24193.38s]  You could always try again.
[24193.38s -> 24195.94s]  See if you can't do better next time around.
[24198.21s -> 24199.57s]  Not a very happy ending.
[24200.74s -> 24201.62s]  Or maybe it is.
[24202.58s -> 24203.14s]  Better.
[24203.14s -> 24205.54s]  What makes you happy, really?
[24205.54s -> 24206.26s]  He knows.
[24206.26s -> 24207.22s]  He's watching the stream.
[24207.22s -> 24208.66s]  And the distributor cap.
[24210.02s -> 24212.32s]  Boom.
[24212.32s -> 24213.28s]  Unfortunate.
[24216.13s -> 24218.69s]  It's all about decisions, isn't it?
[24218.69s -> 24223.57s]  Decisions made in a hurry, in a panic, made with the heart instead of the head.
[24224.13s -> 24225.33s]  Or vice versa.
[24226.29s -> 24230.77s]  Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.
[24231.89s -> 24234.05s]  But there are repercussions.
[24234.05s -> 24235.89s]  But what were the long-term repercussions?
[24236.85s -> 24237.65s]  There wasn't a scenario.
[24237.65s -> 24242.13s]  Is he suggesting that in a future anthology game, those choices are going to matter?
[24242.13s -> 24244.21s]  If they're separate games, I don't see how that's possible.
[24245.25s -> 24250.21s]  But like, we just overwrote everything that we did.
[24250.21s -> 24251.17s]  Until we meet again.
[24251.17s -> 24252.69s]  Maybe in Little Hope.
[24252.69s -> 24254.13s]  Maybe somewhere else.
[24255.41s -> 24256.87s]  But be certain.
[24257.67s -> 24258.79s]  We will meet again.
[24259.59s -> 24260.80s]  But I can't speak.
[24260.80s -> 24261.84s]  Yeah, it's not an anthology.
[24262.96s -> 24269.51s]  Cool.
[24269.51s -> 24270.55s]  All right, you ready to see the...
[24270.79s -> 24280.47s]  McDonald's menu item tier list.
[24280.47s -> 24280.79s]  Now.
[24285.89s -> 24287.33s]  You guys fucking crack me up.
[24293.67s -> 24294.39s]  New content.
[24302.74s -> 24304.02s]  He's chafing a little, I think.
[24304.82s -> 24307.46s]  Why would he be sitting above deck this entire time?
[24307.46s -> 24308.10s]  Is the real question.
[24316.61s -> 24318.21s]  No ship radio.
[24325.36s -> 24326.72s]  You could fish, though.
[24328.04s -> 24329.24s]  And stay alive.
[24329.80s -> 24331.32s]  Well, don't they have a grill?
[24331.32s -> 24334.44s]  They have a radio on the boat with a GPS.
[24335.32s -> 24336.20s]  It just can't move.
[24337.56s -> 24339.88s]  And he's got beds under the deck.
[24340.92s -> 24341.88s]  And a kitchen.
[24342.60s -> 24343.40s]  They've got a George Foreman grill.
[24343.40s -> 24344.20s]  The radio antenna broke.
[24344.84s -> 24348.68s]  Fishing isn't that easy.
[24360.56s -> 24360.96s]  Well, too.
[24360.96s -> 24361.20s]  Okay.
[24362.16s -> 24371.73s]  Uh-oh.
[24371.73s -> 24372.77s]  It's Dan.
[24372.77s -> 24374.37s]  Oh, you motherfuckers.
[24376.13s -> 24381.19s]  That happened to you before it happened to me, apparently.
[24382.15s -> 24384.87s]  Wait, I got jumpscared first?
[24384.87s -> 24386.63s]  Yeah, like a second before.
[24386.63s -> 24387.67s]  I just saw someone in the woods.
[24388.72s -> 24390.00s]  So I like anticipated it.
[24393.00s -> 24397.40s]  Man, the whole stream watched this trailer for the next one three times.
[24397.40s -> 24398.44s]  It wasn't even a Twitch bounty.
[24406.13s -> 24408.44s]  Claim the Twitch bounty.
[24423.08s -> 24423.64s]  We did it.
[24426.52s -> 24427.08s]  Yeah.
[24427.08s -> 24430.20s]  We stretched a three hour game into however long that ended.
[24430.20s -> 24430.84s]  Seven hours.
[24433.16s -> 24434.34s]  All right.
[24434.34s -> 24435.78s]  Let's give another review.
[24435.78s -> 24437.38s]  Time for review two.
[24437.38s -> 24437.70s]  Okay.
[24437.70s -> 24444.45s]  So I have to go through twice and trying to do absolutely like just a dog shit run.
[24444.45s -> 24446.53s]  Just a dog shit run.
[24446.53s -> 24450.29s]  Can you do me a favor, though, and watch the clip of Conrad falling?
[24450.29s -> 24451.33s]  I do want to watch that.
[24455.04s -> 24458.80s]  Does anybody have that little clip of Conrad falling?
[24458.80s -> 24459.52s]  I got it, yeah.
[24459.52s -> 24461.52s]  You've already got it.
[24461.52s -> 24461.84s]  Wow.
[24461.84s -> 24462.56s]  It's impressive.
[24462.56s -> 24463.20s]  I don't even have it.
[24463.20s -> 24464.16s]  In the door of me.
[24465.36s -> 24466.00s]  Let's watch it.
[24466.00s -> 24467.04s]  We're going to watch it on stream.
[24468.16s -> 24474.10s]  So this is the Conrad falling experience.
[24475.41s -> 24475.65s]  All right.
[24475.65s -> 24475.89s]  Hang on.
[24475.89s -> 24476.85s]  Give me a count in the door.
[24479.57s -> 24482.23s]  Okay.
[24482.23s -> 24483.03s]  Let me get it up here.
[24483.83s -> 24489.91s]  So this is from Alex's perspective.
[24489.91s -> 24490.47s]  This is him.
[24491.84s -> 24495.25s]  I'm going to start playing it and let's check it out.
[24496.85s -> 24498.13s]  Did you do the countdown?
[24498.13s -> 24500.69s]  Then three, two, one.
[24500.69s -> 24501.33s]  In the door.
[24502.05s -> 24506.23s]  Well, then what?
[24506.23s -> 24506.95s]  Stop the door.
[24508.10s -> 24508.98s]  You closed it.
[24509.62s -> 24510.90s]  Yeah, but your hand was in it.
[24510.90s -> 24511.94s]  Somebody's hand was in it.
[24512.98s -> 24515.73s]  My God.
[24517.70s -> 24527.08s]  The game is having trouble with trying to figure out.
[24535.20s -> 24536.32s]  Did you just teleport?
[24536.32s -> 24538.16s]  I just saw what is happening.
[24538.96s -> 24540.72s]  Hey, he's done it.
[24540.72s -> 24544.56s]  Ladies and gentlemen, all it took was seven failed cuties in a row.
[24544.56s -> 24552.18s]  Oh, the good classic German laughing.
[24553.94s -> 24554.66s]  Right at the end.
[24555.22s -> 24558.50s]  Oh, because I walked over and it was just the camera panned down.
[24558.50s -> 24560.34s]  Yeah, it was like super delayed lap.
[24560.34s -> 24561.86s]  I had no idea what you were seeing.
[24561.86s -> 24563.30s]  Yeah, because I didn't see any of that shit.
[24564.26s -> 24568.82s]  I walked over and the camera panned down the hole and you were just lying on your back.
[24569.38s -> 24572.63s]  So imagine like Conrad.
[24572.63s -> 24572.79s]  Okay.
[24572.79s -> 24574.31s]  So you did see his body though.
[24574.31s -> 24574.55s]  Yeah.
[24574.55s -> 24575.35s]  Oh, yeah.
[24575.35s -> 24575.59s]  Okay.
[24576.15s -> 24577.59s]  So it wasn't a secret that he died.
[24580.34s -> 24584.72s]  This game is fucking ridiculous.
[24587.08s -> 24588.52s]  Yeah, this was the movies.
[24590.87s -> 24600.18s]  I think it was like a fun co-op experiment that kind of lost sight of the foundation.
[24600.82s -> 24601.22s]  Yes.
[24601.22s -> 24602.58s]  The core principles.
[24602.58s -> 24603.70s]  One hundred percent.
[24608.96s -> 24610.64s]  It was like an interesting idea.
[24611.97s -> 24620.95s]  I wish there were more co-op games, but you got to have some core tenets of gameplay
[24623.06s -> 24623.78s]  that were missing.
[24625.38s -> 24628.02s]  Well, so hot.
[24628.02s -> 24628.98s]  You want to do the next one?
[24630.40s -> 24632.80s]  I'm going to do round three.
[24632.80s -> 24635.04s]  No, I mean the next game.
[24635.92s -> 24638.88s]  Oh, are we going to play the Blair Witch project one?
[24638.88s -> 24640.72s]  I guess we have to at this point.
[24640.72s -> 24641.28s]  Kind of have to.
[24645.57s -> 24645.89s]  All right.
[24645.89s -> 24649.81s]  Well, that's a clean seven hours.
[24651.11s -> 24651.75s]  Wasn't clean.
[24652.95s -> 24655.75s]  Streams went down at least ten times.
[24655.75s -> 24658.23s]  It was an incredibly filthy, dirty stream.
[24661.14s -> 24669.38s]  It was filthy, but yeah, that was Man of Medan.
[24670.10s -> 24671.80s]  It was a game.
[24671.80s -> 24674.98s]  Yeah, that was Man of Medan.
[24677.14s -> 24680.02s]  We kind of knew what we were getting into, but yeah.
[24680.02s -> 24682.34s]  Just be glad you didn't do Blair Witch.
[24685.97s -> 24693.67s]  I heard it was not very good, but I will see you guys tomorrow.
[24693.67s -> 24694.63s]  I'm streaming tomorrow.
[24695.43s -> 24696.31s]  That was Italics.
[24697.03s -> 24699.43s]  Again, everybody say hello to Italics.
[24700.15s -> 24701.19s]  Go follow that stream.
[24701.83s -> 24703.27s]  He streams too.
[24703.27s -> 24704.71s]  You know, he's a fucking streamer.
[24705.75s -> 24706.71s]  Person that's in the call.
[24707.75s -> 24708.31s]  Italics.
[24709.83s -> 24711.35s]  That is how you actually pronounce your name.
[24715.49s -> 24716.93s]  Who is the Man of Medan?
[24716.93s -> 24717.89s]  I don't know.
[24717.89s -> 24719.33s]  I think that's the name of the big boat.
[24720.13s -> 24721.86s]  Isn't it?
[24721.86s -> 24723.30s]  That was like the gigantic boat.
[24723.94s -> 24726.45s]  At least that's what I thought it was.
[24727.97s -> 24729.97s]  Is the boat name Man of Medan?
[24729.97s -> 24730.13s]  Yeah.
[24730.85s -> 24737.75s]  I mean, no, I don't think it is.
[24737.75s -> 24738.95s]  It was the Duke of Medan.
[24740.04s -> 24743.16s]  Yeah, it was the Duke of Milan.
[24746.28s -> 24746.84s]  The Man of...
[24748.50s -> 24749.14s]  Whatever it was.
[24749.86s -> 24753.92s]  That was the small boat.
[24753.92s -> 24754.64s]  Man Milan.
[24756.82s -> 24757.06s]  All right.
[24757.06s -> 24757.86s]  Well, I'm going to get out of here.
[24757.86s -> 24758.90s]  I don't know what to do.
[24758.90s -> 24760.10s]  I'm going to wind down.
[24760.10s -> 24760.66s]  I'll...
[24760.66s -> 24760.90s]  Yep.
[24762.50s -> 24765.24s]  Hey, want to go to McDonald's?
[24767.30s -> 24767.86s]  Uh, no.
[24769.24s -> 24770.92s]  I ate McDonald's yesterday.
[24770.92s -> 24771.16s]  Fuck.
[24771.72s -> 24780.93s]  Anyways, that's the end.
[24781.83s -> 24782.79s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[24783.35s -> 24785.27s]  Tomorrow is...
[24785.27s -> 24787.75s]  Let me just double check to make sure I got everything correct here.
[24787.75s -> 24799.78s]  Tomorrow, we are going to do Terraria.
[24801.38s -> 24803.06s]  I think we actually...
[24803.06s -> 24805.06s]  Both of us are like on the same page.
[24807.36s -> 24810.80s]  So, unless something else happens, which I don't think it will.
[24810.80s -> 24813.17s]  We're going to finish Terraria tomorrow.
[24813.17s -> 24820.42s]  Those streams are cursed, though, because something seems to go wrong every time.
[24820.42s -> 24826.04s]  But we are finally going to close the book on Terraria tomorrow.
[24826.04s -> 24828.21s]  It's going to be a chill stream.
[24828.93s -> 24831.70s]  Thanks for joining me.
[24832.34s -> 24836.05s]  We're going to go out here.
[24838.40s -> 24838.96s]  Do the bits.
[24839.68s -> 24841.76s]  Say hello to the subs.
[24844.56s -> 24845.36s]  Plan B?
[24845.36s -> 24847.04s]  I do have an extreme Plan B.
[24847.68s -> 24849.20s]  But I don't think we're going to need it.
[24849.20s -> 24854.04s]  Because we did confirm that it was going to happen tomorrow.
[24854.04s -> 24856.26s]  So, don't worry.
[24857.44s -> 24860.08s]  All right, now I need to get out of here.
[24864.21s -> 24865.25s]  And let's say good night.
[24865.97s -> 24868.77s]  Thanks for joining us on Man of a Dan.
[24868.77s -> 24869.41s]  It was...
[24869.41s -> 24870.61s]  I don't think the game was...
[24870.61s -> 24872.29s]  Look, the game was not that good.
[24873.25s -> 24875.17s]  But the experience was fun.
[24875.17s -> 24877.73s]  Because, obviously, we were just dicking around and having a good time.
[24878.21s -> 24881.65s]  Playing this with one or two, maybe three or potential four people on a couch.
[24882.61s -> 24883.81s]  There is some value there.
[24883.81s -> 24884.31s]  There is.
[24887.49s -> 24888.05s]  I had a blast.
[24888.05s -> 24888.77s]  I hope you did, too.
[24889.41s -> 24892.95s]  And if we don't see you tomorrow, maybe we'll see you next time.
[24893.59s -> 24897.11s]  So let's rewind a little bit here.
[24897.11s -> 24900.07s]  Let's go back to earlier.
[24900.07s -> 24901.27s]  Lazy Luke had $3.
[24901.27s -> 24902.71s]  They just said Subway 300.
[24903.27s -> 24904.55s]  Thanks to three bucks, Lazy Luke.
[24905.11s -> 24907.08s]  Appreciate it.
[24907.96s -> 24908.36s]  Thank you.
[24910.66s -> 24912.18s]  Thank you, Wiki.
[24912.18s -> 24913.14s]  This for the three bucks.
[24913.14s -> 24916.10s]  This is truly the Citizen Kane of video game stories.
[24918.98s -> 24920.10s]  I mean, it was cool.
[24920.66s -> 24921.78s]  It's an interesting...
[24921.78s -> 24922.50s]  Look, Super...
[24923.06s -> 24925.06s]  Go back to Until Dawn.
[24926.37s -> 24930.05s]  They did a similar kind of game last time.
[24930.93s -> 24936.05s]  I almost feel like they tried to do too much of close to what they did before.
[24936.69s -> 24940.55s]  They're almost like, this game felt like it was...
[24940.55s -> 24941.75s]  Hey, remember Until Dawn?
[24943.67s -> 24944.47s]  There's monsters.
[24944.47s -> 24945.59s]  And there might be other people.
[24945.59s -> 24946.15s]  And there might be...
[24947.84s -> 24948.72s]  There could be other...
[24949.92s -> 24950.96s]  Is it a monster or a person?
[24950.96s -> 24951.76s]  Or is it a...
[24951.76s -> 24952.32s]  Is it a monster?
[24952.32s -> 24952.96s]  It is a monster.
[24955.99s -> 24958.07s]  This actually seemed like it was...
[24958.07s -> 24959.99s]  They rewrote Until Dawn.
[24963.38s -> 24964.90s]  And it just wasn't as good.
[24964.90s -> 24966.02s]  And it was way shorter.
[24973.68s -> 24976.56s]  But the good thing is they made Until Dawn.
[24978.32s -> 24979.12s]  And that game...
[24979.12s -> 24980.16s]  I loved that game.
[24981.17s -> 24982.69s]  So this is one.
[24983.57s -> 24986.93s]  Maybe in like two and three, they'll start to...
[24987.73s -> 24989.73s]  There's been some criticisms of this game already.
[24990.85s -> 24996.85s]  I have faith that Supermassive will, over the next few games in this anthology,
[24996.85s -> 24999.89s]  maybe kind of change it up a little bit.
[25000.69s -> 25010.66s]  Because I mean, they did do...
[25010.66s -> 25012.02s]  That they made Until Dawn.
[25014.47s -> 25016.15s]  If not, then that's a letdown.
[25016.15s -> 25019.91s]  Because there's not very many good horror experiences.
[25021.08s -> 25021.64s]  There are some.
[25022.20s -> 25029.40s]  But it's kind of hard to find a really, really truly good horror game.
[25035.11s -> 25036.31s]  At least in the last...
[25037.27s -> 25038.95s]  I'll wait.
[25040.02s -> 25042.34s]  At least in the last three or four years.
[25042.34s -> 25043.06s]  Five years or so.
[25044.47s -> 25045.03s]  Play Silent...
[25045.03s -> 25047.67s]  Yeah, Silent Hill 2 came out like 15 years ago.
[25047.67s -> 25048.87s]  I'm talking about like now.
[25049.91s -> 25052.95s]  I don't mean that there's never been a good horror game.
[25053.75s -> 25055.27s]  You know, there's never...
[25055.27s -> 25057.99s]  No, I'm talking about like the last like five years.
[25058.71s -> 25066.80s]  There's been a couple.
[25066.80s -> 25068.00s]  And I've played some of them already.
[25071.09s -> 25074.40s]  Resident Evil 2 was...
[25074.40s -> 25075.52s]  Resident Evil 7 was...
[25076.48s -> 25076.72s]  No.
[25077.20s -> 25078.40s]  Resident Evil 7...
[25078.40s -> 25082.56s]  The first like six hours of Resident Evil 7 was an awesome horror game.
[25083.75s -> 25085.51s]  And then they lost me for a little while.
[25086.15s -> 25087.78s]  And then the end was pretty good.
[25091.59s -> 25097.01s]  I didn't like that kind of mid to late game in Resident Evil 7.
[25098.50s -> 25100.66s]  On the boat with, you know...
[25100.66s -> 25101.94s]  But I don't want to give any spoilers.
[25101.94s -> 25105.94s]  But once it became not a scary game anymore, it was kind of just...
[25108.92s -> 25111.56s]  You know, I don't want to talk about it.
[25111.56s -> 25113.64s]  Because I don't know if people haven't played it yet.
[25115.28s -> 25116.72s]  But there was a big string there.
[25116.72s -> 25118.48s]  And I streamed that whole game in VR.
[25119.12s -> 25119.68s]  The whole game.
[25123.86s -> 25125.62s]  They lost me at that end part.
[25125.62s -> 25129.54s]  But the first like 6 to 12, 6 to 10 hours of Resident Evil 7 was fantastic.
[25130.66s -> 25133.46s]  We'll see if the next anthology games are any good.
[25134.02s -> 25143.60s]  But thank you to Demons V for the $15.
[25145.43s -> 25150.07s]  They say blood sacrifice and then like a face.
[25151.75s -> 25153.43s]  Thank you for the $15 Demons V.
[25154.23s -> 25155.38s]  Really appreciate it.
[25157.65s -> 25159.17s]  Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[25160.84s -> 25162.84s]  I'm fucking revoking your gamer license.
[25163.56s -> 25167.91s]  What gaming did I do tonight?
[25177.49s -> 25178.37s]  You can't do that.
[25178.93s -> 25184.63s]  But thank you, Sticks Renegade.
[25184.63s -> 25187.67s]  I didn't know you were an authority on the gamer licenses.
[25191.96s -> 25193.80s]  Shitty Viewbot, thanks for the $10.
[25193.80s -> 25196.20s]  Just admit, German buddy, you fucked up.
[25198.64s -> 25199.12s]  I did.
[25199.12s -> 25200.00s]  I know I did.
[25200.00s -> 25206.60s]  But it's all right.
[25208.16s -> 25208.56s]  I did.
[25208.56s -> 25209.12s]  I messed up.
[25210.32s -> 25212.48s]  But thank you for the $10, Shitty Viewbot.
[25215.84s -> 25217.20s]  Errorless, thanks for the $2.50.
[25217.20s -> 25219.44s]  Hey, Jerma, can you give these bits to italics, please?
[25220.64s -> 25225.92s]  Yeah, let me go to McDonald's and I buy him a McChicken.
[25229.00s -> 25229.48s]  Thank you, though.
[25231.67s -> 25233.19s]  Thank you, Trampston, for the $5.
[25233.19s -> 25238.79s]  I'm going to come through this monitor and give you a peck, a punch on the nose.
[25238.79s -> 25239.03s]  What?
[25242.40s -> 25244.72s]  We are going to, this is going to be an interesting,
[25245.60s -> 25248.79s]  this is going to be a very interesting credits
[25250.88s -> 25254.40s]  because the stream, Twitch had a ton of problems earlier tonight.
[25255.12s -> 25258.88s]  And the stream turned off like probably five to six times.
[25259.44s -> 25266.84s]  I am curious as to see if any of who even is on this list.
[25268.80s -> 25269.84s]  Still pretty significant.
[25272.48s -> 25276.16s]  Now, it was definitely not Cox because they were portions where
[25277.44s -> 25280.40s]  italics stream would be at zero and I would still be fine and live.
[25281.20s -> 25284.48s]  And other people were talking about how there was other streamers having problems.
[25284.48s -> 25286.32s]  So I guess it was because it stopped.
[25287.20s -> 25290.48s]  So I don't think that was a Cox thing tonight.
[25291.04s -> 25297.33s]  But thank you to, thank you Trampston.
[25297.33s -> 25297.81s]  Appreciate it.
[25298.53s -> 25300.10s]  What's the name of the song?
[25300.10s -> 25301.70s]  This is an original song by Blordo.
[25302.34s -> 25305.88s]  This is an original made for the end of this stream song.
[25315.24s -> 25318.60s]  Speaking of which, I have, I still have stuff that I have to put on.
[25319.24s -> 25323.73s]  It seems like every day something else is like happening
[25324.37s -> 25325.97s]  that like I can't just sit down and do it.
[25327.30s -> 25330.18s]  But I do, I have new stuff from Blordo.
[25330.18s -> 25330.66s]  I have it.
[25331.38s -> 25334.10s]  I have to just set it up and do it and set up the scenes and everything.
[25334.10s -> 25336.02s]  And I just haven't, I just haven't been able to sit down and do it.
[25342.20s -> 25343.40s]  Yes, you will see that.
[25344.36s -> 25346.92s]  I'm, it's, it has to be.
[25347.72s -> 25352.37s]  Like the next time I stream after this weekend, it'll all be there.
[25352.37s -> 25352.93s]  It has to be.
[25352.93s -> 25354.13s]  Like I've held on for too long.
[25354.77s -> 25362.93s]  That is good shit though.
[25363.49s -> 25364.29s]  You guys are gonna like it.
[25369.70s -> 25370.34s]  OST.
[25370.34s -> 25371.38s]  A German I-95.
[25371.38s -> 25372.26s]  OST.
[25378.58s -> 25379.78s]  Need some more emotes too.
[25379.78s -> 25384.87s]  Yeah, I gotta do a whole, once the carnival stream is done,
[25385.59s -> 25389.49s]  I'll have a lot more brain power to actually sit down.
[25389.97s -> 25392.13s]  There's a lot going on this in September.
[25392.13s -> 25393.97s]  The carnival stream is coming up really soon.
[25394.69s -> 25396.69s]  TwitchCon is right after that.
[25398.28s -> 25401.64s]  So my brain is kind of all over the place this month.
[25402.36s -> 25409.24s]  But good night everybody.
[25410.76s -> 25412.04s]  We'll see you tomorrow if you show up.
[25412.84s -> 25416.69s]  Am I going to TwitchCon?
[25416.69s -> 25417.09s]  I am.
[25419.14s -> 25424.37s]  But I am going to because of the carnival stream.
[25425.80s -> 25427.00s]  I'm not gonna go the whole time.
[25428.39s -> 25431.99s]  So I will only be at TwitchCon for like a day or two.
[25432.71s -> 25439.17s]  So I'm not gonna be there from Thursday to Monday or what a lot of people usually do.
[25440.13s -> 25445.40s]  But I will be there for at least a day or two.
[25446.12s -> 25457.56s]  When's the new Discord channel going up for videos, art, and all that?
[25458.80s -> 25460.08s]  I'm gonna talk to...
[25461.20s -> 25464.96s]  I will have like a little mod thing tomorrow.
[25465.68s -> 25468.24s]  Tomorrow after my stream I'll just get that all set up.
[25468.24s -> 25473.60s]  I'm also gonna get a hard date for the activity book stream after tomorrow's stream.
[25473.60s -> 25475.84s]  So I'll give you all this information soon.
[25476.80s -> 25479.94s]  I'm gonna see who's around tomorrow to talk about it all.
