[0.38s -> 21.46s]  I've been training all day. I don't know how to get clothes though.
[21.46s -> 27.83s]  You have no Drip? You have no Roblox Drip?
[27.83s -> 30.83s]  He's got the default character face.
[30.83s -> 33.58s]  I don't have any V-Bucks.
[33.58s -> 35.58s]  Get some V-Bucks, or Robux.
[35.58s -> 38.58s]  Why would I give Roblox money?
[38.58s -> 39.58s]  Because they're-
[39.58s -> 41.58s]  Just so they can enslave our youth.
[41.58s -> 45.04s]  True.
[45.04s -> 50.04s]  Give me one second. I've got a whole fucking thing behind me. Hold on.
[50.04s -> 54.07s]  Give me like two minutes.
[54.07s -> 57.70s]  Hi everybody. Welcome to the stream.
[57.70s -> 62.52s]  It's a very special stream today.
[62.52s -> 70.01s]  Because today, today is somebody's birthday.
[70.01s -> 74.01s]  I don't know whose birthday it is, but it's probably yours.
[74.01s -> 81.67s]  I made a promise a week ago.
[81.67s -> 85.94s]  And we're gonna do it.
[85.94s -> 87.94s]  So we got a couple people here.
[87.94s -> 91.11s]  We got Oak and Ster.
[91.11s -> 96.82s]  Oak is going to guide Ster and I through the world of Roblox.
[96.82s -> 99.06s]  Because that's exactly what we're playing.
[99.06s -> 104.88s]  So I'm just gonna show this because this is kind of a pain in the ass setup, but whatever.
[104.88s -> 110.64s]  Oh, let me ask this question.
[110.64s -> 116.88s]  Hey, before I show everybody the screen, does it matter if they can see my username?
[116.88s -> 124.50s]  I mean, they're gonna see it anyways, right?
[124.50s -> 131.39s]  Yeah, it does.
[131.39s -> 133.76s]  Ain't a lot of nos and yeses.
[133.76s -> 135.76s]  I was muted. Oops.
[135.76s -> 139.76s]  You want to go to your profile and go to security or privacy?
[139.76s -> 142.76s]  And make it so only friends can join you.
[142.76s -> 144.76s]  Okay, cool. Yeah, I think I already have that setup.
[144.76s -> 145.76s]  Alright, cool.
[145.76s -> 155.08s]  Cool, cool. Alright, I'm gonna show this because people are waiting for it.
[155.08s -> 159.22s]  Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
[159.22s -> 162.22s]  Happy Roblox birthday to whoever that was a week ago.
[162.22s -> 168.68s]  I actually don't remember who it is.
[168.68s -> 169.68s]  Are you kidding me?
[169.68s -> 173.20s]  Yeah, Poke, it's somebody's birthday.
[173.20s -> 175.20s]  That's the reason why I'm playing Roblox today.
[175.20s -> 176.20s]  Well, happy birthday, somebody.
[176.20s -> 180.22s]  Yeah, happy birthday.
[180.22s -> 183.21s]  Is it a real person?
[183.21s -> 186.09s]  I think so, yeah.
[186.09s -> 188.65s]  I actually think it's somebody's birthday. Who is it?
[188.65s -> 191.30s]  It's my birthday.
[191.30s -> 192.30s]  Is it really? Happy birthday, dude.
[192.30s -> 194.30s]  Yeah, you didn't get me anything, but this will suffice.
[194.30s -> 199.47s]  Tell me I haven't been hitting you up daily to play Roblox.
[199.47s -> 204.91s]  Yeah, you can have some of that giant cookie over there if you want.
[204.91s -> 205.91s]  Save it. I'll be there.
[205.91s -> 207.91s]  I didn't get a fucking cake.
[207.91s -> 209.91s]  I've kind of been sick for four days.
[209.91s -> 213.54s]  Well, then it's not really a party.
[213.54s -> 214.54s]  Oh, there's a delay on the camera. Oops.
[214.54s -> 221.25s]  Hold on, I'll fix it.
[221.25s -> 222.25s]  No, there isn't. You're a liar.
[222.25s -> 227.56s]  Oh, they're lying. Okay.
[227.56s -> 230.31s]  Alright, are we ready?
[230.31s -> 232.31s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[232.31s -> 233.55s]  What? What?
[233.55s -> 236.79s]  Okay, so this is Roblox, right? It's a kid's game.
[236.79s -> 238.35s]  Kind of.
[238.35s -> 239.78s]  Kind of.
[239.78s -> 243.78s]  On the main menu, how come I've already got Survive Michael Jackson?
[243.78s -> 246.24s]  It's a kid's game.
[246.24s -> 248.24s]  Hold on, there is a delay.
[248.24s -> 249.24s]  I fixed the delay.
[249.24s -> 250.24s]  I fixed the delay.
[250.24s -> 251.24s]  I fixed the delay.
[251.24s -> 252.24s]  I fixed the delay.
[252.24s -> 253.24s]  Wait.
[253.24s -> 257.04s]  What?
[257.04s -> 258.04s]  Alright, Poke.
[258.04s -> 259.04s]  We got to...
[259.04s -> 262.42s]  Poke, you've got to help us.
[262.42s -> 264.42s]  I'm trying really hard.
[264.42s -> 265.42s]  I tried to make a list.
[265.42s -> 266.42s]  I have five things.
[266.42s -> 267.42s]  That works.
[267.42s -> 268.42s]  We can jump into random stuff.
[268.42s -> 271.42s]  I want to do Survive Michael Jackson in the kid's game.
[271.42s -> 272.42s]  Why don't we just do that right now?
[272.42s -> 273.66s]  First thing.
[273.66s -> 278.66s]  I don't want to play Survive Michael Jackson.
[278.66s -> 280.66s]  Why not?
[280.66s -> 283.66s]  Wait, it's my birthday and I don't even get to pick the game.
[283.66s -> 290.48s]  Alright, do we have to make a party or do we just all join that one?
[290.48s -> 295.38s]  I think you could join or we could join off you and friends.
[295.38s -> 297.69s]  Okay, I think I can just join it.
[297.69s -> 303.34s]  Yeah.
[303.34s -> 304.34s]  Okay, so let's go.
[304.34s -> 305.71s]  Wait, no.
[305.71s -> 308.71s]  Is the server going to fill with people if we say what we're doing?
[308.71s -> 310.53s]  Probably.
[310.53s -> 313.05s]  Oh, shit.
[313.05s -> 319.54s]  But there should be a lot of people playing it regardless.
[319.54s -> 321.54s]  There are so many of these.
[321.54s -> 322.54s]  Which one?
[322.54s -> 323.54s]  How many?
[323.54s -> 324.54s]  Area 51?
[324.54s -> 327.89s]  Yeah.
[327.89s -> 332.96s]  Survive Michael Jackson in Area 51 Kill Killers.
[332.96s -> 333.96s]  Oh, my God.
[333.96s -> 335.96s]  4.2 million people have played this.
[335.96s -> 337.96s]  Alright, I'm just going in.
[337.96s -> 338.96s]  Are we just going in?
[338.96s -> 340.78s]  Yep.
[340.78s -> 341.78s]  We just click the play button.
[341.78s -> 342.78s]  We just join off you and friends.
[342.78s -> 344.78s]  How loud is this game, by the way?
[344.78s -> 348.49s]  Should I turn it down or something or does that not matter?
[348.49s -> 351.90s]  It might be loud.
[351.90s -> 353.34s]  Okay, hold on.
[353.34s -> 355.83s]  Oh, my God, dude.
[355.83s -> 358.93s]  Did you see my character?
[358.93s -> 361.19s]  I'm joining you right now.
[361.19s -> 367.81s]  I have a rocket launcher?
[367.81s -> 368.81s]  I just saw you fall in the hole.
[368.81s -> 370.94s]  Oh, wait.
[370.94s -> 371.94s]  There's in-game voice.
[371.94s -> 374.50s]  Oh, you have to put your ID for that.
[374.50s -> 377.83s]  So if you're not verified, you won't hear voice.
[377.83s -> 379.83s]  Okay, I thought I heard something.
[379.83s -> 380.83s]  I got spooked.
[380.83s -> 383.10s]  Rocket launcher.
[383.10s -> 385.55s]  Buy.
[385.55s -> 386.86s]  No!
[386.86s -> 388.61s]  Did I just buy it?
[388.61s -> 389.61s]  Oh, cancel.
[389.61s -> 390.61s]  How much Roblox?
[390.61s -> 391.61s]  Do you have any Roblox?
[391.61s -> 393.61s]  I have like $100 in Roblox or something.
[393.61s -> 398.88s]  199 Roblox is like $1.
[398.88s -> 400.88s]  It's like five cents.
[400.88s -> 403.53s]  Alright, let's go.
[403.53s -> 407.15s]  Let's play this game.
[407.15s -> 408.15s]  I'm the guy behind you.
[408.15s -> 409.15s]  Oh, where are you?
[409.15s -> 411.70s]  Oh, wow.
[411.70s -> 412.70s]  What was that?
[412.70s -> 413.70s]  Who's doing that?
[413.70s -> 414.70s]  You're doing that in voice?
[414.70s -> 415.70s]  No, that's Michael Jackson.
[415.70s -> 416.70s]  What?
[416.70s -> 417.70s]  Wipe him.
[417.70s -> 419.13s]  Wait, he's right here.
[419.13s -> 420.13s]  Oh, my ears.
[420.13s -> 421.13s]  I can't hear.
[421.13s -> 422.13s]  I just ran away from you.
[422.13s -> 423.13s]  I think I'm dead.
[423.13s -> 428.13s]  I just saw you die.
[428.13s -> 429.43s]  What?
[429.43s -> 433.06s]  Okay, this is very strange.
[433.06s -> 436.23s]  I'm going to turn the audio down just a little.
[436.23s -> 438.23s]  I can't hear anything.
[438.23s -> 439.23s]  You can't hear that?
[439.23s -> 442.74s]  I can't hear anything.
[442.74s -> 450.44s]  Let me turn this down.
[450.44s -> 451.44s]  Hold on.
[451.44s -> 454.32s]  Wait, Michael Jackson's right there.
[454.32s -> 457.32s]  Should I turn chat off too?
[457.32s -> 459.32s]  Or do you keep that on?
[459.32s -> 461.32s]  I usually hide it.
[461.32s -> 462.32s]  Or maybe put your camera...
[462.32s -> 464.52s]  Alright, where's the audio?
[464.52s -> 465.52s]  There it is.
[465.52s -> 466.52s]  Oh, my...
[466.52s -> 467.52s]  Why would they do that?
[467.52s -> 472.52s]  Why would they have that be the thing that plays when you go down on the volume?
[472.52s -> 473.52s]  Why would they do that?
[473.52s -> 475.95s]  I don't even hear anything when I go down.
[475.95s -> 476.95s]  It's using the wrong...
[476.95s -> 477.95s]  What was it?
[477.95s -> 481.95s]  It was an extremely loud sound effect when I pressed the down button on the volume.
[481.95s -> 484.95s]  That's not even fucking cool.
[484.95s -> 485.95s]  What?
[485.95s -> 486.95s]  Jesus.
[486.95s -> 492.93s]  Okay.
[492.93s -> 497.01s]  Are we all right?
[497.01s -> 498.01s]  Yeah.
[498.01s -> 500.38s]  I'm turning this shit all the way fucking down.
[500.38s -> 501.38s]  Alright, let's go.
[501.38s -> 502.38s]  I'm so sorry about that.
[502.38s -> 506.37s]  Alright.
[506.37s -> 507.37s]  No, I got to turn that off too.
[507.37s -> 511.37s]  How are you guys enjoying Survive God?
[511.37s -> 515.87s]  I'm trying to get my sound to even work at all.
[515.87s -> 519.39s]  You guys want to try a different map?
[519.39s -> 520.39s]  Yeah, I'm just doing my settings.
[520.39s -> 522.53s]  Hold on.
[522.53s -> 523.53s]  We're just getting through this.
[524.53s -> 526.53s]  Oh, it's a private map, I think.
[526.53s -> 527.53s]  What's the...
[527.53s -> 529.53s]  How do I make it so people can't talk in the chat room?
[529.53s -> 532.66s]  Do I have to do that in my profile?
[532.66s -> 533.66s]  I don't even know how to turn it off.
[533.66s -> 534.66s]  I think...
[534.66s -> 546.87s]  Alright, I'll try it one more time.
[546.87s -> 550.16s]  What just happened?
[550.16s -> 554.16s]  Why are there two different Michael Jacksons chasing this one person?
[554.16s -> 555.85s]  Oh, now they're chasing me.
[555.85s -> 556.85s]  I just aggroed.
[556.85s -> 567.29s]  They cloned them in Area 51.
[567.29s -> 569.74s]  How do you sprint?
[569.74s -> 570.74s]  Is there no sprint?
[570.74s -> 575.16s]  Oh, you can press the chat button.
[575.16s -> 577.68s]  Hide it.
[577.68s -> 580.58s]  Top left.
[580.58s -> 581.58s]  What is going on?
[581.58s -> 584.95s]  I wish I was a map that I could see where you guys were.
[584.95s -> 590.58s]  Okay, I think I got it.
[590.58s -> 593.27s]  The first sound I heard was...
[593.27s -> 597.27s]  I thought that was one of you guys doing that in the call.
[597.27s -> 603.59s]  I think we're doing pretty good.
[603.59s -> 609.74s]  How do you win surviving Michael Jackson?
[609.74s -> 611.74s]  There might not be a win condition here.
[611.74s -> 614.74s]  I feel like he just gets everyone eventually.
[614.74s -> 620.42s]  Alright, that was a good warm-up.
[620.42s -> 622.42s]  Pog, let's jump to one of the maps.
[622.42s -> 627.13s]  I'm getting us a nice obstacle course map.
[627.13s -> 633.59s]  Why did we let Ster pick the first game?
[633.59s -> 636.98s]  What were we thinking?
[636.98s -> 641.06s]  I feel like it's a prerequisite to be able to play anything else.
[641.06s -> 644.06s]  You need to be able to survive Michael Jackson, then you're free to go around the play lane.
[644.06s -> 647.62s]  Ster, do I have you?
[647.62s -> 648.62s]  I don't know.
[648.62s -> 649.62s]  I added you.
[649.62s -> 651.62s]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[651.62s -> 652.86s]  Oh, I got you.
[652.86s -> 654.86s]  Okay, go to your friends list and join off me.
[654.86s -> 658.86s]  Alright, so what's the easiest way to get out of this without closing the whole application?
[658.86s -> 660.94s]  You could just close it and then...
[660.94s -> 661.94s]  Oh, okay.
[661.94s -> 662.94s]  You have the website open, right?
[662.94s -> 666.24s]  Yeah, the app is what is being captured, right?
[666.24s -> 669.18s]  So is this going to kick me out of the app?
[669.18s -> 670.18s]  Oh, no.
[670.18s -> 673.18s]  You exit the experience and it's got me back on the, like, I don't know.
[673.18s -> 674.18s]  You're on the website?
[674.18s -> 676.55s]  I got the desktop mode.
[676.55s -> 678.55s]  Well, I'll use these as a website and then click on the website.
[678.55s -> 679.55s]  Oh, back home.
[679.55s -> 680.55s]  I see, back home.
[680.55s -> 684.55s]  Okay, so I'm going to hide my screen so we can make sure we get in somewhere before everybody else does.
[684.55s -> 688.63s]  So we'll see.
[688.63s -> 689.63s]  Are you in a game right now, Pog?
[689.63s -> 691.06s]  Yeah.
[691.06s -> 695.54s]  Can I just join off you somehow?
[695.54s -> 698.54s]  Yeah, I should be on friends.
[698.54s -> 700.16s]  See me?
[700.16s -> 701.16s]  I see you on friends.
[701.16s -> 703.59s]  I could go to view profile.
[703.59s -> 704.59s]  Is there join?
[704.59s -> 708.97s]  On your profile, I can unfriend you.
[708.97s -> 710.72s]  I don't want to do that.
[710.72s -> 713.37s]  Okay, hold on.
[713.37s -> 717.30s]  See all.
[717.30s -> 718.30s]  Oh, friend activity.
[718.30s -> 719.30s]  Here it is.
[719.30s -> 720.30s]  Okay, I see.
[720.30s -> 721.30s]  Is it this one?
[721.30s -> 722.30s]  Yeah, that's the one you're in.
[722.30s -> 723.30s]  All right, going in.
[723.30s -> 724.86s]  Yeah.
[724.86s -> 725.86s]  Oh, I see you.
[725.86s -> 726.86s]  I don't see that you're in one.
[726.86s -> 728.29s]  Really?
[728.29s -> 730.29s]  Yeah, I don't see either of you are in a game.
[730.29s -> 731.53s]  Refresh it.
[731.53s -> 732.53s]  You just joined one.
[732.53s -> 733.53s]  Yeah, you got to refresh it.
[733.53s -> 736.86s]  Well, I saw yours before I saw him.
[736.86s -> 737.86s]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[737.86s -> 739.16s]  What do you mean?
[739.16s -> 740.16s]  You're an amateur at this.
[740.16s -> 741.16s]  What are we doing?
[741.16s -> 744.16s]  I've never this first time we've you and I have ever opened this whole game.
[744.16s -> 749.13s]  We're doing this obstacle course stage one out of 50.
[749.13s -> 755.70s]  The popular one right now amongst children.
[755.70s -> 756.70s]  Okay.
[756.70s -> 759.51s]  So are we just going for it?
[759.51s -> 760.51s]  I went for stir.
[760.51s -> 761.51s]  Is he here?
[761.51s -> 763.51s]  Oh, they're like move my mouse.
[763.51s -> 767.90s]  You're going to turn your sensitivity way down.
[767.90s -> 768.90s]  Okay.
[768.90s -> 769.90s]  You're fire guy, right?
[769.90s -> 770.90s]  You're the phantom fireman.
[770.90s -> 771.90s]  I'm fire guy.
[771.90s -> 772.90s]  Box is way too big.
[772.90s -> 773.90s]  I'm default guy.
[773.90s -> 774.90s]  Okay.
[774.90s -> 776.46s]  Yeah, I see you right here.
[776.46s -> 778.46s]  And then there's the weird robot with the chain.
[778.46s -> 780.22s]  All right.
[780.22s -> 781.22s]  Are we going?
[781.22s -> 782.39s]  Yeah.
[782.39s -> 783.39s]  Okay.
[783.39s -> 784.39s]  Here we go.
[784.39s -> 786.53s]  All right.
[786.53s -> 788.15s]  Let's go.
[788.15s -> 789.15s]  Let's race.
[789.15s -> 792.70s]  Wee.
[792.70s -> 793.70s]  Oh, there's a jump.
[793.70s -> 794.70s]  Oh, okay.
[794.70s -> 795.70s]  Cool.
[795.70s -> 796.70s]  Is there any sound on this map?
[796.70s -> 797.70s]  Yeah, I don't know why it's so quiet.
[797.70s -> 799.51s]  It's just like footprints.
[799.51s -> 800.51s]  I don't even hear footprints.
[800.51s -> 802.51s]  Usually there's like fun music.
[802.51s -> 803.51s]  Okay.
[803.51s -> 805.51s]  Be careful when I'm holding right click and that's kind of probably a bad idea.
[805.51s -> 806.51s]  Right?
[806.51s -> 812.72s]  Because when I turn the camera, I think you press shift once and it goes like into a different
[812.72s -> 814.28s]  lock.
[814.28s -> 815.28s]  Oh, all right.
[815.28s -> 821.45s]  Not bad.
[821.45s -> 823.58s]  There's no music.
[823.58s -> 824.58s]  Oh, you can climb too.
[824.58s -> 827.42s]  Cool.
[827.42s -> 828.42s]  Oh, shit.
[828.42s -> 832.86s]  All right.
[832.86s -> 834.10s]  Be careful.
[834.10s -> 842.26s]  I think we're doing pretty good.
[842.26s -> 843.26s]  Yeah.
[843.26s -> 845.71s]  Dude, you're a 37 year old man.
[845.71s -> 848.17s]  Yeah.
[848.17s -> 849.17s]  Whatever.
[849.17s -> 851.37s]  Do you have any idea what fucking today is?
[851.37s -> 855.77s]  Honestly, if the kids are into it, you need to stop being such a boomer and acclimate.
[855.77s -> 857.89s]  Like if you don't get it, that's on you.
[857.89s -> 858.89s]  It's going to take like two or three hours.
[858.89s -> 859.89s]  Everyone else gets it.
[859.89s -> 861.37s]  It's going to take me all day to clean up.
[861.37s -> 865.27s]  I think you guys are like an hour ahead of me.
[865.27s -> 866.58s]  Did you fall down?
[866.58s -> 867.82s]  On stage seven.
[867.82s -> 868.82s]  You can skip.
[868.82s -> 870.18s]  You can pay money to skip the stage.
[870.90s -> 872.90s]  You can pay money.
[872.90s -> 873.90s]  Yeah.
[873.90s -> 875.65s]  Wait, why is this?
[875.65s -> 880.60s]  How come the floor is gone?
[880.60s -> 881.60s]  Yeah.
[881.60s -> 882.60s]  I'm just going to pay the money.
[882.60s -> 883.60s]  I'll see you guys at the end.
[883.60s -> 885.48s]  What is happening?
[885.48s -> 886.48s]  How much is it to skip?
[886.48s -> 890.66s]  Wait, there's like weapons.
[890.66s -> 892.86s]  I'm going to delete this.
[892.86s -> 893.86s]  You have to wait.
[893.86s -> 898.24s]  You have to buy.
[898.24s -> 899.24s]  What?
[899.24s -> 906.97s]  You stand over it and it's like, hey, use your Robux to get the gravity coil.
[906.97s -> 910.51s]  How much is this?
[910.51s -> 911.51s]  800 Robux?
[911.51s -> 918.06s]  That's how they get you.
[918.06s -> 920.62s]  It's 50% off, dude.
[920.62s -> 923.64s]  Are you going to pass up that dude?
[923.64s -> 929.30s]  What the fuck is going on?
[929.30s -> 930.66s]  Why can I not do this one?
[930.66s -> 933.31s]  All right.
[933.31s -> 934.94s]  No, wait, go, go, go, go.
[934.94s -> 937.20s]  All right.
[937.20s -> 938.20s]  I made it.
[938.20s -> 939.20s]  Is there really no music for you?
[939.20s -> 940.20s]  Like there's no music, right?
[940.20s -> 941.20s]  No.
[941.20s -> 942.20s]  I'm playing my own.
[942.20s -> 943.20s]  Okay.
[943.20s -> 944.20s]  No.
[944.20s -> 945.20s]  There's only like, there's only sound effects.
[945.20s -> 947.61s]  I don't know why it's so quiet.
[947.61s -> 949.05s]  How does it even happen?
[949.05s -> 954.07s]  It defaulted audio for me to my VR headset that's not plugged in.
[954.07s -> 959.07s]  So I think it might have done that again.
[959.07s -> 960.39s]  I'm so glad I turned it down.
[961.13s -> 962.65s]  Oh, I need the magic carpet.
[962.65s -> 968.51s]  Wait, you're going to spend money on the magic carpet, but not on like a cool outfit?
[968.51s -> 969.51s]  No, I'm not.
[969.51s -> 972.40s]  I'm a free to play Robloxer.
[972.40s -> 973.60s]  Whenever you guys are ready for the next map.
[973.60s -> 975.67s]  I got one.
[975.67s -> 976.67s]  I want to see that.
[976.67s -> 979.77s]  I want to see how far I can get with this.
[979.77s -> 981.90s]  Cool.
[981.90s -> 982.90s]  Yeah.
[982.90s -> 983.90s]  I saw you playing a game like this earlier today, poke.
[983.90s -> 984.90s]  So you're all, you're all practice.
[984.90s -> 986.21s]  Is this person hacking poke?
[986.21s -> 987.21s]  This person is flying around.
[987.21s -> 988.21s]  No, you probably paid money.
[988.21s -> 989.45s]  Okay.
[989.45s -> 992.10s]  This stage was hard.
[992.10s -> 996.54s]  So, but all right.
[996.54s -> 997.54s]  I have a question.
[997.54s -> 1008.91s]  If you bought the magic carpet to fly around, what's the point of the whole game?
[1008.91s -> 1011.95s]  Isn't the whole point like to jump around and jump on the platforms that you just like
[1011.95s -> 1012.95s]  fly to the end?
[1012.95s -> 1014.26s]  Yeah.
[1014.26s -> 1019.46s]  But instant gratification, you can just, you can just do it.
[1019.46s -> 1023.02s]  They offer the versus took my fucking hair.
[1023.02s -> 1027.40s]  What just happened?
[1027.40s -> 1031.07s]  Oh, wait.
[1031.07s -> 1032.07s]  I got it.
[1032.07s -> 1033.57s]  I got it.
[1033.57s -> 1036.72s]  I don't know what's happening at like any moment.
[1036.72s -> 1038.42s]  I see you over there, poke.
[1038.42s -> 1050.73s]  I see you going pretty far at a defaulted Roblox to my headset, my VR again.
[1050.73s -> 1055.22s]  Don't people make wild, wild shit in this game?
[1055.38s -> 1056.38s]  Yeah.
[1056.38s -> 1058.58s]  They're a whole like Call of Duty games, right?
[1058.58s -> 1059.58s]  And I don't know.
[1059.58s -> 1060.58s]  Oh, yeah.
[1060.58s -> 1063.81s]  I'll show you that one.
[1063.81s -> 1066.26s]  Pretty crazy.
[1066.26s -> 1067.57s]  I made some progress.
[1067.57s -> 1068.57s]  Oh, dude.
[1068.57s -> 1070.19s]  Where are you?
[1070.19s -> 1071.31s]  I'm on stage 18 out of 50.
[1071.31s -> 1072.31s]  You're a little bit ahead of me.
[1072.31s -> 1073.31s]  I am.
[1073.31s -> 1074.31s]  Yeah.
[1074.31s -> 1076.13s]  This person is like, what is this person doing?
[1076.13s -> 1077.13s]  It's person out of here.
[1077.13s -> 1078.13s]  Get away from me.
[1078.13s -> 1079.37s]  What the fuck is this person doing?
[1079.37s -> 1081.86s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[1081.86s -> 1082.86s]  Get out of here.
[1082.86s -> 1086.80s]  I have to win so I can hold on.
[1086.80s -> 1089.06s]  Wow.
[1089.06s -> 1093.46s]  As someone who didn't get into the fall guys craze, this is probably the best version of
[1093.50s -> 1095.62s]  jumping around on colorful blocks that exists.
[1095.62s -> 1098.25s]  It actually is kind of fun.
[1098.25s -> 1100.70s]  It kills you.
[1100.70s -> 1101.70s]  That's pretty sick.
[1101.70s -> 1103.01s]  I'm missing music.
[1103.01s -> 1104.95s]  He loves the Roblox.
[1104.95s -> 1110.35s]  I don't like how quiet it is.
[1110.35s -> 1111.35s]  This might be my new main game.
[1111.35s -> 1112.98s]  Roblox is great.
[1112.98s -> 1113.98s]  I think it's.
[1113.98s -> 1114.98s]  I'm just gonna say it.
[1114.98s -> 1116.73s]  What?
[1116.73s -> 1118.42s]  I think it's better than Minecraft.
[1118.42s -> 1119.42s]  Ooh.
[1119.42s -> 1120.98s]  Yeah.
[1120.98s -> 1122.92s]  People are gonna hate me for that one.
[1122.92s -> 1123.92s]  Oh, you've been doing Minecraft speedruns, haven't you?
[1123.92s -> 1124.92s]  Yeah.
[1124.92s -> 1127.57s]  It's fun.
[1127.57s -> 1129.51s]  Why is there an ad right here for this?
[1129.51s -> 1130.51s]  Wait, this is an ad?
[1130.51s -> 1138.65s]  When you see it.
[1138.65s -> 1147.96s]  When you see it, you'll laugh.
[1147.96s -> 1148.96s]  I'm like enjoying.
[1148.96s -> 1149.96s]  I'm having a good time right now.
[1149.96s -> 1153.16s]  I'm actually enjoying this.
[1153.16s -> 1154.16s]  That makes sense to me.
[1154.16s -> 1157.40s]  These are like, this is the pace of game you typically enjoy.
[1157.40s -> 1158.56s]  Wait, the ad disappeared.
[1158.56s -> 1164.56s]  Get out of here.
[1164.56s -> 1165.56s]  I didn't see the ad.
[1165.56s -> 1169.09s]  Wait, I saw an ad.
[1169.09s -> 1170.09s]  You didn't see it.

[1304.42s -> 1308.42s]  Oh, are you at the thing where it's blue and red and yeah
[1308.42s -> 1314.75s]  Yeah, so when you touch don't it's very confusing when you touch the red you die. No, but on some of them

[1319.79s -> 1326.52s]  You're the last person I would expect to complain about a game being like a little difficult
[1326.80s -> 1334.44s]  Well, I should be higher up on your list because apparently I hate literally every game
[1337.46s -> 1343.03s]  What?
[1343.13s -> 1348.13s]  You know what now I'll give it to you. This is insane. This is really hard

[2749.26s -> 2752.54s]  I'm more I'm just saying I'm more impressed that there's a kill cam
[2753.10s -> 2761.35s]  That's that's a lot more complicated than making things look pretty. I'm sure someone dedicated to the blocks
[2763.05s -> 2764.53s]  blocks together
[2764.53s -> 2779.29s]  Turn up your graphics. Yeah, I think they're there's not even a graphics slider or setting in the game. Is there that's what you think
