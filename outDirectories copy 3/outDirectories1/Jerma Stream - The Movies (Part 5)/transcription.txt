[1.02s -> 15.48s]  Hey, how are you? Hope you're doing good. I'm doing all right. I just had a chicken Caesar salad wrap.
[16.44s -> 21.16s]  Finished it up. The whole plate. Like a good boy. That means I get this Captain Crunch.
[24.92s -> 28.92s]  Happy Father's Day. Happy Father's Day to all you fathers out there. And I'm not a father,
[28.92s -> 32.84s]  so everyone saying happy Father's Day to me. I'm not. I don't have any children.
[33.64s -> 47.58s]  But if you do, Dad, Gerva is the father. You're our father. Well, thanks. Thank you.
[48.54s -> 63.96s]  Thank you, kids. Thanks, kids. Yep. But what did you get me? Okay.
[65.00s -> 68.04s]  Did you do anything mean? What is that? What is that? Didn't get me anything.
[78.28s -> 81.08s]  Not going to... I mean, I looked out the window and I noticed
[81.48s -> 94.50s]  the lawn still ain't cut. Am I going to go do that? Or it's getting kind of tall.
[98.15s -> 107.37s]  It's getting a little tall. And last night, I just want to... Your mother was coming in with
[107.37s -> 113.53s]  the groceries and you playing that that cartoon game with the walls of the Minecraft
[113.53s -> 117.29s]  shooter, whatever it is, Fortnite. You didn't get up and help your mother with the
[117.29s -> 127.85s]  groceries. And I had to... Thank you, though, kids. Is this shit that your dad said?
[133.70s -> 140.20s]  Maybe in another time. Not this current time, though. Anyways, hello. Yes. Happy
[140.20s -> 145.72s]  Father's Day, though. What we're going to do, I'm going to block out a plan for you.
[145.72s -> 151.08s]  Are you ready for this plan? At the end of this week, I am not going to be here.
[152.44s -> 159.93s]  I mean, like physically not going to be here. I have some things going on. I am visiting some
[159.93s -> 168.12s]  family. And during that same time period, about five days or so, I'm going to be doing a lot
[168.12s -> 173.32s]  of work on a big stream. So I'm going to be spending a lot of time putting it together,
[174.04s -> 180.73s]  getting it ready. And that's what I'm going to be doing. 50-50 family and like working on a
[180.73s -> 189.54s]  stream. So I will not be here for about five days. That was disgusting. I'm really sorry.
[192.10s -> 198.36s]  Another colonoscopy. No, no, no, no. That's the most disgusting sound ever.
[199.64s -> 204.94s]  This is why I can't be live. See, if this was a recording, I would have been like,
[204.94s -> 207.42s]  all right, whatever, that's here. And then I would have gotten in and I would have cut that
[207.42s -> 213.26s]  out. I would have just taken the razor tool and right where it went, cut that part of
[213.26s -> 218.70s]  the audio, cut that part of the audio at the end, delete, and then put like background noise
[218.70s -> 222.06s]  there. And you wouldn't even know. I did that a million times. You know, many times I fucking
[222.06s -> 225.82s]  sneezed on a video and just, it was gone. And then I manipulated the video to a point
[225.82s -> 235.58s]  where you didn't know I had sneezed on it. Anywho, today we're going to do the movies.
[235.58s -> 239.88s]  We're going to go back to the movies. Talked about it yesterday. It's been a long enough
[239.88s -> 246.78s]  time where I think it would be fun to go back in. And also not just about that,
[246.86s -> 251.18s]  just about that. But more importantly here, five community subs just came in from Derma
[251.18s -> 257.10s]  lied about the clown car. Thank you for the five community subs. Appreciate the five subs.
[258.50s -> 265.08s]  Derma lied about the clown car. But I'm going to give you the, let's break it down. So
[265.08s -> 270.44s]  today we're going to play the movies. I'm going to re-familiarize myself with the game
[270.44s -> 274.36s]  because it's been like two or three years. I don't really remember all the tools. We're
[274.36s -> 277.64s]  just going to go through the beginning of the game, maybe start a new studio, make
[277.64s -> 282.20s]  a few things, whatever, and relax and play and learn the game again, kind of. Now I
[282.20s -> 288.60s]  also have like a hundred fucking mods, like 40 characters, like 50 new sets, like hundreds,
[288.60s -> 293.16s]  like hundreds of props. I have tons of fucking mods. We're not going to use those today
[294.17s -> 298.01s]  because I, I need to, I want to like make sure I know what I'm doing and where we're
[298.01s -> 302.09s]  going. So there's going to be two movie streams. This one's going to be the
[302.17s -> 309.05s]  re-familiarize and make some movies. And the one after is going to be like the fuck you table
[309.05s -> 314.10s]  of movie streams. I don't want to give any spoilers as to some of these characters that
[314.10s -> 322.34s]  are in it, but I hope they all work. Also star and I are going to be playing deep rock
[322.34s -> 327.21s]  galactic at some point this week as well. So that's what's going to be happening for the
[327.21s -> 331.29s]  remainder of this week. I'm going to play that dwarf game, whatever the hell it is.
[332.01s -> 336.42s]  So now that we've gone over that, you can understand what you can expect this week,
[337.14s -> 344.79s]  like fucking sick. Okay. Let's open up the movies. If you don't know the movies,
[349.22s -> 357.75s]  this is some of the best, most fun I think we've ever had on, on camera. I think I would say
[364.60s -> 366.84s]  gatekeeping your own channel.
[367.16s -> 375.13s]  Yeah. I was just like, yeah, that's what it is. Gatekeeping my own channel. Why am I doing that?
[375.13s -> 385.45s]  Let's go. Uh, you cannot hear anything, but you will be able to see. Well, actually never
[385.45s -> 393.99s]  mind. You can see things now. You remember this screen? It's been a while. So I remember a
[393.99s -> 397.83s]  little bit. I remember a little bit about the game. I remember like a few things that
[397.83s -> 401.24s]  are very important to know, but I don't think I need to do like the, I know how to like
[401.24s -> 407.05s]  move the camera and shit. If I need help, I can go do it. Right? We're going to do new
[407.05s -> 421.96s]  game, uh, studio, poor productions. What's this? This is important. I need to make an actor. You
[421.96s -> 429.54s]  got to make directors and like, and cameramen and stuff. Oh yeah. Pop out your eyes. Productions.
[429.54s -> 433.46s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. We got, this is a different studio. That studio was liquidated.
[433.46s -> 438.63s]  That doesn't exist anymore. We, we had too many flops and too many bad decisions,
[438.63s -> 444.09s]  but they're getting, yeah. Get back. They're getting too close. Back up. Yes. I know. Hi.
[444.09s -> 458.25s]  Excuse me. How about horse? What? No. How about, um, here we go. No, no, no. How about
[459.46s -> 471.05s]  chopped up? Uh, cut? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Leo incorporated,
[471.05s -> 482.82s]  Leo P Pants productions. No, it's not going to be Leo P Pants. Uh, I don't know. Prime,
[482.82s -> 500.38s]  Prime Chuck productions. The name of your studio doesn't matter. It shows nobody.
[500.38s -> 519.02s]  P Pants limited. Bursting with laughter. Big chin productions. P Pants limited LLC.
[519.02s -> 525.58s]  P Pants limited limited liability company. No, that sucks. That's like too easy of a joke.
[534.57s -> 542.65s]  P Pants liability. How do you, should it be P Pants liability? P Pants limited Leo liability,
[542.65s -> 567.78s]  limited Leo company. How about just P Pants liability? No, I'm not naming my company
[567.78s -> 588.78s]  machinima. It's fucking liquidated in like less than five years. Got it. P Pants liquidated
[588.78s -> 601.16s]  company. Sounds pretty good to me. Name. No, that's my name. Okay. P Pants liquidated
[601.16s -> 611.80s]  is the name of the company. I don't have any actors though. Welcome to the dawn of the movie.
[611.80s -> 616.20s]  The same fucking thing happened last time I played this. The year is 1920 and your new studio's
[616.20s -> 623.48s]  success lies in your hands. You must guide it to greatness. You must create the biggest movie
[623.48s -> 630.36s]  and employ the most famous stars as you strive to reach the summit of the studio charts
[630.36s -> 637.00s]  and reap the rewards of victory. First build a thriving studio, hire wannabes,
[637.00s -> 642.68s]  and they're gonna have actors. Here comes the old content that'll get the big box rolling in
[642.68s -> 650.04s]  and clean up at the awards. Then with every award you win, with every success you enjoy,
[650.04s -> 657.72s]  your studio's reputation will grow. Soon stars from rival companies will flock to your studio
[657.72s -> 663.80s]  and you'll unlock new mods, scenes and sets to make your movies better than ever.
[663.80s -> 669.16s]  But once you unlock those mods, there's no going back. That's why you have to wait till the
[669.16s -> 677.00s]  next stream. That's once fucking Batman shows up and drop kicks R2-D2 through a glass pane.
[677.64s -> 683.51s]  We ain't doing the regular game again. Welcome to your new movie studio. Turn this shit up.
[683.51s -> 694.49s]  Okay, let me get a audio. Let's turn it up. That sounds a little bit better, don't you think?
[695.29s -> 701.19s]  All right, here's our lot. We have to make some stuff. Before you open the studio,
[701.19s -> 707.80s]  you'd better set up some of the essentials. I remember some of this. We need the box office,
[707.80s -> 712.60s]  right? Stage school, right? You can place the stage school anywhere by left clicking
[712.60s -> 718.12s]  at the desired location. Go ahead, give it a try. We've already done the regular game. I'm
[718.12s -> 722.76s]  only doing this because I just need to refamiliarize myself with the tools and the controls. I can't
[722.76s -> 727.24s]  just jump into sandbox mode because I'll just have no idea what I'm doing. It's been three
[727.24s -> 732.44s]  years since I did the same video in the same stream. Center it. What do you mean center it?
[734.54s -> 741.77s]  It's off center. It's always going to be off center. All right. To build the stage school,
[741.77s -> 746.41s]  you'll need to hire a builder at the staff office by the studio. This is the staff,
[746.41s -> 750.25s]  right? Oh, that's right. You got to go to the studio gate. Now click and hold down
[750.25s -> 755.29s]  the left mouse button briefly to pick them up. Yeah, you did. It's actually like janitors,
[755.29s -> 760.90s]  right? And stuff you have to actually create. Follow the sparkling stream and drop them in
[760.90s -> 767.30s]  the builders. Many janitors by left clicking. Great. Builders perform any building and
[767.30s -> 772.34s]  maintenance duties automatically so you can leave them to it. Fantastic. While the
[772.34s -> 776.34s]  stage school is being built, you can use this time to sort out the rest of the building,
[776.34s -> 782.10s]  which we need, uh, active studio, right? You need one janitor. No, you ever played a game
[782.10s -> 787.14s]  like this. You need like 30 janitors and you need to put them in patrols in tiny little
[787.14s -> 791.78s]  locations. Okay. Let's keep going. Okay. Now build a casting casting office, right?
[791.78s -> 796.58s]  You'll need this for assigning stars to your movies. You can rotate a building by holding
[796.58s -> 801.86s]  down the left mouse button and moving the mouse around in a circle. Try this now. Casting
[801.86s -> 807.14s]  office would be down here. P Pants, uh, liability company is, you know, we're going to be get,
[807.14s -> 815.75s]  make it clean. I'm thinking like, thinking like right here. Great. Now build a crew
[815.75s -> 824.60s]  facility. Yep. Crew facility. You need crew. Yep. Yep. Yep. We'll have this up here.
[825.80s -> 831.64s]  Yep. You need to janitor. Let's get a few builders actually.
[832.60s -> 838.71s]  Okay. You'll also need a set to shoot your movie on. The stage set will be perfect for
[838.71s -> 846.97s]  you. You're making a porn studio. I am not making a porn studio. Stage, right? Stage.
[847.77s -> 854.76s]  This is our first little baby set, but this is like 1920. Let's go. Let's go like over here.
[856.07s -> 860.47s]  Back here. Finally build a production office. You'll need this to release your movie.
[861.27s -> 865.50s]  Oh, you edit it right. I forgot about this. This is so much. I forgot. We're going to be here for a
[865.50s -> 879.38s]  while. Production office is going to be over here. I love this. You should put it over here,
[879.38s -> 884.50s]  right here. Excellent. Now you've got everything you need for your movie. You can look at
[884.50s -> 888.82s]  improving the studio environment. It's the perfect time to get the jump on the porn industry.
[888.82s -> 897.43s]  Imagine how rich you get if you invented porn. One of the keys to running a successful studio
[897.51s -> 902.15s]  is making sure your staff can easily find their way around. Okay. I guess.
[903.59s -> 907.67s]  Click on the landscaping button, then select the sparkling path icon.
[909.03s -> 912.55s]  Lay a path by left clicking and dragging out the shape on the ground.
[913.43s -> 916.55s]  I'm going to connect everything. The flashing connection points on your buildings.
[917.27s -> 925.03s]  Let's go this way. Did I fuck it up already? Yeah, I did. Don't worry about it though.
[925.03s -> 937.21s]  This is just for us to learn. Nothing else matters. I can go like this. All right.
[938.89s -> 946.31s]  This one also needs to be connected. There it is. And we need to our set as well.
[947.03s -> 955.67s]  This is one little baby line. All right. Excellent. I'm starting to remember. It's all
[955.67s -> 960.87s]  coming back to me. Another important factor of having a great studio is to make sure your
[960.87s -> 966.39s]  staff have a nice working environment. Try placing down some ornaments. Trees,
[966.39s -> 969.03s]  bushes. They're going to make some nice stuff here. Okay. Now place some ornaments around
[969.03s -> 974.07s]  the studio. Left click to place an ornament and right click to get rid of the one you're
[974.07s -> 977.59s]  holding. Oh, let's go with how about one of these plates? Am I out of money? Try to use
[977.59s -> 982.39s]  a range of different ornaments as variety is the best way to keep the studio lot looking
[982.39s -> 993.03s]  attractive. Okay. Time to move on. Remember to place down more ornaments as the studio expands.
[993.03s -> 1001.59s]  Corners. There we go. This is better. Look at that. There we go. Looks good. Looks good.
[1002.71s -> 1008.60s]  Excellent. The studio is now ready. Carry on improving things if you wish. And when
[1008.60s -> 1015.30s]  you're ready, you can open the studio. I think we're ready to open. This is the
[1015.30s -> 1020.34s]  casting office. This is the stage school. This is the hire crew. You get a director
[1020.42s -> 1026.22s]  here. You create a crew. I know what I'm, I think I figured it out. Let's go. Are you
[1026.22s -> 1033.19s]  ready to open the studio? I am ready to open the studio. Congratulations. The studio is
[1033.19s -> 1040.17s]  officially open. Thank you. Now I need a director and we have to make an actor too.
[1040.17s -> 1045.45s]  You are tuned in to KMBS Wireless on a frequency of one to one point five.
[1045.45s -> 1050.81s]  And I am your wireless announcer, Mr. William Laker. Director, lead role, crew, extras.
[1050.81s -> 1058.65s]  Okay, let's do, so I need a couple actors. Who's this? Jeff Grant. I need to make my
[1058.65s -> 1069.14s]  own, don't I? Can I make my own? Is there a way I can do that, right? Would you put Jeff
[1069.14s -> 1077.69s]  Grant in here? All right, Jeff Grant is now an actor. There he is. Okay, time to make your
[1077.69s -> 1082.73s]  first movie. Director Leo. You won't get far without an actor and a director, so select a
[1082.73s -> 1090.25s]  couple of appropriate wannabes at the stage school. Appropriate wannabes. Uh, how about
[1091.54s -> 1098.02s]  Jen Bolton? Now you just need a director. Bear in mind that a director won't appear in
[1098.02s -> 1102.26s]  front of the camera. That's it. Okay, time to move on. All right, so we've got Jen Bolton and
[1102.26s -> 1107.30s]  we got Jeff Grant. So we have, we're ready for, the world is ready for a comedy.
[1108.26s -> 1117.53s]  The Bag Boy. I remember this shit. Bag Boy script complete. Follow the stream to the casting
[1117.53s -> 1121.69s]  office where you can get your new stars to rehearse them. Okay, I remember this. We're
[1121.69s -> 1129.05s]  gonna bring in actors. Let's start by assigning your new director. Okay, let's go. You,
[1130.86s -> 1136.22s]  you're here. Cast your new actor. Bag, baggage boy is here. The stars have now started
[1136.22s -> 1140.22s]  rehearsing the script. This will help boost the final quality of the movie.
[1141.50s -> 1150.76s]  So now we need some crew, right? We need some crew. You guys can be fine. Available
[1150.76s -> 1155.72s]  crew will fill any required crew positions so you don't need to assign them. Look at
[1155.72s -> 1159.40s]  the movie to see how rehearsal is progressing. Rehearsal is doing pretty well. We can speed
[1159.40s -> 1170.54s]  it up. You make a script and then you put it into casting and then okay. Yep, I remember.
[1171.42s -> 1178.86s]  I'm just learning how to ride the bike. The script has finished. It's time to bring this
[1178.86s -> 1185.82s]  over to shoot it. Your movie is now shooting. Go to the stage set to follow its progress.
[1185.82s -> 1190.86s]  Now can't we do it on our own? Let's check what everyone is doing by looking at the cast
[1190.86s -> 1198.31s]  and crew information bubble on the movie. They're currently shooting. They're already
[1198.31s -> 1205.38s]  shooting. Oh wait, don't they tell you like that you don't have to like unlock that?
[1206.26s -> 1208.95s]  I'm pretty sure I have to unlock that. They're running all the way over there.
[1214.12s -> 1217.48s]  The first movie always sucks. It's always just like hey this is how you learn how to play the
[1217.48s -> 1222.50s]  game. So they're heading for the set. There's only two people. Then he like lifts up barbells
[1222.50s -> 1242.68s]  or something. Get in there. Here they come. Oh yeah, it's an old camera. The first scene is now
[1242.68s -> 1247.56s]  being shot. You can see the overall movie progress in the movie's information bubbles.
[1248.92s -> 1258.01s]  Yeah, you try to lift the barbell. This is the first movie ever made. Scenes that are
[1258.01s -> 1263.69s]  still to be shot are displayed in the movie's shooting schedule bubble. Each scene shows which
[1263.69s -> 1273.22s]  set it will be shot on. Yes, we're currently in this is just three scenes shooting the first
[1273.22s -> 1278.90s]  one. Okay, now you can continue to follow the movie's progress. I didn't even do anything.
[1279.70s -> 1284.34s]  In preparation for your next movie, build the new set that has become available.
[1284.58s -> 1294.39s]  Cut his mic. Wild West Saloon. Put the sets back here. Okay, while the movie is shooting,
[1294.39s -> 1299.99s]  it's worth looking after the rest of the studio. Look around the studio for information icons and
[1299.99s -> 1308.66s]  the corresponding tips. Look for those things in the studio. I said we've already got
[1310.95s -> 1315.91s]  this is if you can find any job seekers or if you have any spare staff members try turning
[1315.91s -> 1324.36s]  someone into a janitor. Yeah, here we go. Here's the janitor. Casey, you're a janitor.
[1325.16s -> 1330.82s]  Take care of the place. Okay, anything else that I'm going to need to remember besides the
[1332.15s -> 1335.91s]  right? This is okay. Movie player archive reviews, finance, right? Remember this part,
[1335.91s -> 1345.34s]  you put the movie over here. This is the crew. Here's actors and directors. I need to make
[1346.87s -> 1351.03s]  some characters. When we get out of here, we do sandbox and we start to actually make
[1351.03s -> 1363.16s]  movies. I got to make a few people. All right, this one's done. Oh no, it's not. You're still
[1363.16s -> 1378.09s]  shooting the same scene. Why am I looking at the wall? And that's not me. Landscape and
[1378.09s -> 1391.54s]  ornaments connected over here. Nope, straight ahead. All right, good. So why does the first
[1391.54s -> 1402.25s]  movie go? It's a damn shame this game is so hard to come by nowadays. This is one of the
[1402.25s -> 1409.70s]  best games ever made. That is true. Unfortunately, it is hard to come by. I wish they would
[1409.70s -> 1416.46s]  just re-release it somewhere, put it somewhere. I don't know why they don't do that. Who even
[1416.46s -> 1428.71s]  owns the rights to this now? Microsoft? Yeah, Microsoft. Yeah, this could use a GOG release.
[1428.71s -> 1433.69s]  All right, double left click on an empty set for a fly through that will show off its key
[1433.69s -> 1439.69s]  features. All right, shooting's done. But I want to take a look at it though.
[1440.57s -> 1445.30s]  Well, we are just going to watch it. Okay, release the movie. You don't need to...
[1445.94s -> 1453.18s]  whatever. All right, baggage boy is released. Script quality is awful. The movie's terrible.
[1453.98s -> 1463.45s]  We get to watch it. Here we go. It's time to watch the baggage boy. I guarantee you he just
[1463.45s -> 1469.54s]  picks up the dumbbell and he can't lift it and he hurts his back. Here we go. Let's
[1469.54s -> 1537.35s]  take a look at that movie. Yep, that's it. That's the whole thing. What is this part?
[1537.35s -> 1547.43s]  I don't remember this part. Why am I getting like yelled at? It took 11 months to make this
[1547.43s -> 1558.55s]  shit. Wow, I didn't remember that. All events and characters in this movie are fictional.
[1558.55s -> 1565.35s]  Anything similar to real people living or dead is a coincidence. Right, there we go.
[1570.81s -> 1573.61s]  No, I don't... we're not watching that again. Okay, that was the baggage boy.
[1575.93s -> 1581.64s]  Pretty good. The effective movie on your staff and studio. They're not that stressed
[1581.64s -> 1587.21s]  up but they made some money. It cost ten dollars. Was that... is that ten bucks?
[1589.05s -> 1598.20s]  Eleven bucks. That's not eleven thousand. Six months to make. It's blatantly obvious
[1598.20s -> 1603.24s]  that Jeff Grant doesn't have a great deal of comedy experience directed with a blatant
[1603.24s -> 1607.56s]  disregard for quality. Grant, I didn't make it. If I made it we would have people fucking
[1607.56s -> 1618.70s]  screaming. The movie makes money over the course of a couple years. Right.
[1621.90s -> 1627.34s]  This game is so fucking good. I miss it. I'm so glad... you know when... okay, here's the thing.
[1627.90s -> 1630.78s]  You know when you don't do something for so long and you come back and it's like brand
[1630.78s -> 1637.80s]  new again? That's how I feel right now. I feel like I'm... I'm glad I don't remember
[1637.80s -> 1642.28s]  much from like a couple years ago, whatever, two, three years ago. Oh, this is fantastic. I'm
[1642.28s -> 1646.84s]  so glad that I like don't remember any of this. Your studio's chart rating is based on the
[1646.84s -> 1651.48s]  movies you release, the stars you employ, and the overall status of your studio.
[1653.34s -> 1659.82s]  The bigger your stars, the higher your studio rating. Alright, time for me to make one. I'm
[1659.82s -> 1666.09s]  gonna make a little one. The better your movies, the higher your studio rating. It's not quite
[1666.09s -> 1678.07s]  time to go into the sandbox mode yet. Let's click on the rosette. Old Rope Cinema,
[1678.07s -> 1691.30s]  Pee Pants Liquid. These are the rival studios. Okay, movie charts. Okay, star charts and then
[1691.30s -> 1699.22s]  studios. Yeah, it just shows you how you're doing. Now that you have a movie out and some
[1699.22s -> 1703.38s]  money in the bank, it's time to take a closer look at your stars and staff. People in
[1703.38s -> 1709.06s]  weird costumes and stuff. Your employees need good sanitation, so place down some restrooms
[1709.06s -> 1715.46s]  to improve your studio rating. Your employees need good catering provisions too. A snack van
[1715.46s -> 1721.99s]  will do for now. Great, this will raise not only your catering rating, but your overall
[1721.99s -> 1731.30s]  studio rating too. Happy stars make better movies. If you want a star to perform well
[1731.30s -> 1735.46s]  in a movie, you need to make sure they're happy. That's too convenient of a bathroom
[1735.54s -> 1755.94s]  location. What do you mean? It's bad. So who the hell am I gonna make? I have to make
[1755.94s -> 1759.62s]  like a couple of directors, I gotta make some actors. I made like Glooman last time.
[1760.10s -> 1766.42s]  When the mood bar goes below the lower threshold line, it will glow red. This means a star is
[1766.42s -> 1772.26s]  very unhappy. You can't. You can only make like default characters. You can't make like
[1772.26s -> 1778.98s]  huge noses. I could do Jax. One aspect of a star's mood is how they feel about their image.
[1779.62s -> 1785.14s]  Try hovering over your stars to see how they feel. You have to work on like clothes and
[1785.22s -> 1793.99s]  stuff. Yeah, okay. One way to improve a star's image is to give them a makeover.
[1793.99s -> 1798.87s]  Give them a makeover. Remember, you can rotate. You can drop builders around the sides of the
[1798.87s -> 1808.02s]  building to speed up construction if you want. Use the arrows above the star icons to view your
[1808.02s -> 1815.06s]  other staff types. Staff icons can be used in the same way as star icons. You can drop
[1815.06s -> 1823.27s]  builders around the edges like orcs. Okay, speaking of builders, and where are they?
[1825.83s -> 1836.31s]  Make Super Jax a director. I can't. I can't make Super Jax. How am I supposed to do that?
[1855.70s -> 1857.14s]  Yeah, I can do Adam Sandler. That's easy.
[1857.14s -> 1867.37s]  See it before it drives off on the real plan. The makeover department is built.
[1867.37s -> 1872.74s]  Pick up a star whose image you want to improve. Okay, let's go with um, let's go with Jeff
[1872.74s -> 1878.98s]  Grant. Okay, give this star a makeover. Go to the bathroom. Follow the guiding stream to
[1878.98s -> 1885.46s]  your new makeover. Go to the bathroom. The makeover department is built. No, no, no. Okay,
[1885.46s -> 1889.94s]  give this star a makeover. Drop a star in the makeover room to enter the makeover screen.
[1892.42s -> 1917.66s]  Okay, I can re, I can rename. Okay, this is the 1920s. How do I get, how do I take the
[1917.66s -> 1932.65s]  hat off? Oh, I forgot. This is the, this is the 1920s. Nobody never, nobody ever didn't
[1932.65s -> 1974.92s]  have a hat on. People like slept in their hats, didn't they? Okay, not bad. Those long,
[1974.92s -> 2001.14s]  long ass sideburns. That's fine. That's fine. This is just temporary. This is temporary,
[2001.14s -> 2010.58s]  temporary, temporary. Or use the auto room if you don't mind what using the makeover
[2010.58s -> 2016.42s]  screen is. No, I hate it. And gives you more control, but be careful not to choose something
[2016.42s -> 2027.66s]  that. Holy shit, he's about to lose his mind. Well, I guess I did to take his hair. Stars
[2027.66s -> 2031.66s]  are happy with their image. Somebody said, Hey, I'm going to do a makeover for you.
[2031.66s -> 2035.90s]  Oh, are you? Yeah, I'm actually just going to like cut your hair off and fuck your whole
[2035.90s -> 2046.18s]  head up and make you bald and then put you in underwear and make you leave. Okay. Great.
[2046.74s -> 2050.98s]  Remember to revisit the makeover department. If any stars are unhappy with their image,
[2050.98s -> 2055.46s]  I think I can remember mostly everything now until we, we get to like the more
[2055.46s -> 2059.54s]  intricate stuff with the timeline editor, but I think it'll just start to come back to me as
[2059.54s -> 2063.62s]  I play. All right. Let's, let's just, let's see if I can make another movie.
[2063.62s -> 2067.94s]  As you can imagine, the more successful your stars become, the more money they want.
[2073.27s -> 2077.94s]  Play with mods. I am going to play with mods, just not tonight. I'm going to be doing
[2077.94s -> 2082.50s]  another movie stream where I literally throw up a bunch of dog shit into the boulders.
[2082.50s -> 2090.02s]  I have hundreds of files that have to be installed. I have probably a hundred and like
[2090.02s -> 2097.22s]  25 different props and characters and costumes and shit. It's going to be out of control.
[2098.02s -> 2102.34s]  Hover over one of your stars to see how they feel about their salary.
[2102.98s -> 2106.50s]  If you want to give a star a raise, take them to the production office.
[2108.92s -> 2111.96s]  Yeah, there's a blue screen. Yes. I'm going to be
[2112.68s -> 2115.00s]  giving you guys some footage to use if you want to.
[2115.88s -> 2120.50s]  All right. So let's hover into the production office.
[2124.50s -> 2126.34s]  Finance room. Here we go.
[2131.66s -> 2133.26s]  There. Have a little bit more money.
[2136.22s -> 2138.46s]  Okay. I guess I'm all right with you cutting my hair off.
[2138.70s -> 2142.46s]  Stars can become jealous of their colleagues, too, if treated unfairly.
[2146.76s -> 2150.76s]  All right. At some point, your stars will begin to get bored and will need something new to do.
[2151.88s -> 2155.80s]  Have a look at your star's information bubbles to see how bored they are.
[2155.80s -> 2160.44s]  If the boredom bar falls below the threshold line, a star will become very bored,
[2160.44s -> 2165.24s]  which will affect their mood. The bar will gradually go down when a star has no work.
[2166.20s -> 2169.43s]  The boredom bar.
[2175.61s -> 2177.85s]  You're fine. You're fine. Still making money.
[2177.85s -> 2179.29s]  Sixty-one thousand bucks.
[2179.29s -> 2182.49s]  Making movies is a good way to prevent stars from becoming bored.
[2182.49s -> 2186.09s]  You've acquired another script, which can be found at the studio gates.
[2188.44s -> 2189.40s]  Here's our new script.
[2191.13s -> 2196.01s]  Remember to follow the guiding streams and read the information bubbles to see what you need to do.
[2197.53s -> 2199.37s]  Let's get you in the leading role.
[2199.37s -> 2203.05s]  This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[2203.05s -> 2205.85s]  You can hire extras at the stage school.
[2205.85s -> 2212.33s]  Okay. I think that's it. I think I know what I'm doing.
[2213.91s -> 2216.47s]  I think it's time to actually start, like, the real game.
[2217.88s -> 2221.56s]  This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[2221.56s -> 2223.88s]  You can hire extras at the stage school.
[2225.50s -> 2227.34s]  So we have to go back into sandbox.
[2229.91s -> 2233.11s]  This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[2233.51s -> 2236.47s]  You can hire extras at the stage school.
[2236.47s -> 2239.48s]  I think I'm pretty sure I got the right idea now.
[2239.48s -> 2244.28s]  I just needed to do that initial, like, tutorial to get back into the swing of things here.
[2245.08s -> 2248.70s]  I'm gonna save it just in case there's something I don't remember
[2248.70s -> 2251.02s]  that I have to come back and remember and re-familiarize.
[2251.02s -> 2256.86s]  So I think that's good.
[2257.59s -> 2260.17s]  All right. Let's go and do the real one.
[2260.17s -> 2262.01s]  And that's, let's make, I gotta make characters first.
[2264.18s -> 2265.94s]  All right. I turned it down because it's very loud.
[2268.47s -> 2269.99s]  I have to go back to the main menu.
[2277.50s -> 2279.34s]  Okay. So, game.
[2281.21s -> 2284.73s]  There's sandbox, but I don't, I need, it's a, it's a different window,
[2284.73s -> 2285.93s]  isn't it, to make a new character?
[2288.90s -> 2290.50s]  I think I have to open a separate thing.
[2291.06s -> 2297.14s]  Yeah, it's a, it's a different EXE.
[2297.14s -> 2299.72s]  All right. Give me Zach.
[2299.72s -> 2300.52s]  Let's get that open.
[2301.16s -> 2302.71s]  Let's make the characters.
[2303.35s -> 2307.93s]  So who the fuck did, this is really important because whoever is in here,
[2309.83s -> 2314.94s]  this is like who we use for the whole game.
[2314.94s -> 2317.58s]  It's gotta be some, it's gotta be people who they'd like to have.
[2318.30s -> 2327.53s]  Let's get it open.
[2328.41s -> 2329.93s]  You guys can, I think you guys can see it, right?
[2330.49s -> 2331.94s]  We should be able to.
[2334.81s -> 2336.25s]  Okay. Star maker.
[2336.25s -> 2336.73s]  Here it is.
[2337.29s -> 2342.97s]  Might have to run this in a different window.
[2342.97s -> 2344.01s]  Hopefully it's not too loud.
[2348.15s -> 2348.87s]  Is it running in this?
[2348.87s -> 2350.39s]  It is running in a separate window, isn't it?
[2350.95s -> 2352.70s]  All right. Here we go.
[2353.50s -> 2361.59s]  Hey, look. Hey, look at that.
[2361.59s -> 2363.50s]  Can you not see it?
[2363.50s -> 2364.46s]  Why not?
[2364.46s -> 2369.29s]  Come on, show it.
[2369.29s -> 2370.57s]  Why can you not see it?
[2370.57s -> 2376.94s]  Why can you not see this?
[2380.02s -> 2380.74s]  Star maker.
[2380.74s -> 2381.46s]  It's showing up here.
[2382.10s -> 2386.10s]  Well, this is dumb.
[2386.74s -> 2390.15s]  I mean, it's clearly here.
[2390.87s -> 2393.22s]  Let me try this.
[2394.02s -> 2401.91s]  It's not technically a game though.
[2401.91s -> 2407.62s]  Can you see it now?
[2408.34s -> 2412.90s]  That's irritating.
[2412.90s -> 2414.82s]  Ah, there's only, there's one more way I can get this to work
[2414.82s -> 2415.70s]  and it's I just hit the pole.
[2416.42s -> 2422.49s]  Just capture the whole, hold on.
[2422.49s -> 2423.13s]  Bear with me here.
[2423.77s -> 2425.13s]  I don't know why it's not capturing this.
[2425.13s -> 2427.61s]  It's kind of annoying, but what the fuck just happened?
[2428.17s -> 2429.93s]  Why did I lose every window?
[2430.57s -> 2434.18s]  Why are computers so dumb?
[2434.18s -> 2437.90s]  All right, well hold on.
[2437.90s -> 2438.70s]  This is important.
[2443.14s -> 2445.78s]  Monitor capture is the only way this is going to work.
[2445.78s -> 2449.38s]  There we go.
[2451.94s -> 2455.19s]  Hey, look, it's a tiny little window,
[2455.19s -> 2456.31s]  but you can see it at least.
[2465.43s -> 2466.39s]  Boomer wallpaper.
[2466.39s -> 2468.47s]  This has been the wallpaper for like a year.
[2468.47s -> 2470.34s]  Yeah, so window capture didn't work.
[2470.34s -> 2471.30s]  Game capture didn't work.
[2471.30s -> 2472.18s]  Only display capture.
[2472.18s -> 2472.74s]  Let's go.
[2472.74s -> 2473.38s]  Actor.
[2473.38s -> 2485.58s]  Let's go like this as well.
[2485.58s -> 2487.34s]  Just to make it a little bit better for you.
[2490.06s -> 2491.10s]  All right, so this is Jex.
[2491.66s -> 2496.39s]  All right, basic settings.
[2496.39s -> 2502.26s]  Let's do, what is, we got to get a good base here.
[2502.98s -> 2507.64s]  That's not a bad base.
[2512.84s -> 2513.88s]  Jex is not that old.
[2518.87s -> 2520.23s]  It's definitely not this guy.
[2523.18s -> 2523.98s]  This one's not bad.
[2523.98s -> 2524.54s]  Hold on.
[2524.54s -> 2525.10s]  No.
[2525.10s -> 2530.02s]  Why can I not go down here?
[2530.02s -> 2530.42s]  Looks.
[2530.42s -> 2530.98s]  Oh, here we go.
[2530.98s -> 2532.02s]  This is important.
[2532.02s -> 2538.41s]  It's really good action.
[2538.41s -> 2539.85s]  Not that great comedy.
[2547.90s -> 2549.42s]  Stress threshold.
[2549.42s -> 2549.98s]  Boredom.
[2551.93s -> 2552.57s]  Food.
[2552.57s -> 2554.41s]  Definitely have actions full.
[2554.41s -> 2555.27s]  Trimness.
[2557.51s -> 2559.69s]  All right, we can't have him be that good looking.
[2560.25s -> 2563.37s]  He's got to be kind of more sci-fi.
[2564.55s -> 2567.37s]  No, he had no comedy at all.
[2567.37s -> 2569.05s]  Action, horror, split this up evenly.
[2571.02s -> 2571.74s]  Boredom, drink.
[2571.74s -> 2573.34s]  He needs to drink all the time.
[2573.34s -> 2574.30s]  Stars, drink.
[2574.86s -> 2575.98s]  Addiction threshold.
[2576.54s -> 2581.40s]  You don't have to be that trim.
[2581.40s -> 2583.16s]  How about chest size?
[2584.38s -> 2586.06s]  Actually, no, that is important.
[2586.06s -> 2590.26s]  All right, that's okay.
[2590.26s -> 2590.66s]  Horror.
[2592.46s -> 2593.74s]  He's like a little bit funny.
[2596.04s -> 2596.92s]  And then mood.
[2601.78s -> 2602.42s]  Hey, he's like...
[2604.02s -> 2605.69s]  But Jex is not even handsome.
[2608.44s -> 2609.56s]  He's not funny at all.
[2609.56s -> 2611.96s]  No, why would, I'm the funny one, okay?
[2618.07s -> 2625.14s]  I think that's all right.
[2627.62s -> 2628.90s]  Base, eyebrows.
[2628.90s -> 2634.49s]  Oh, eye makeup, necessary.
[2634.49s -> 2635.37s]  Facial hair, none.
[2636.01s -> 2639.14s]  Change the hairstyle.
[2640.10s -> 2642.26s]  See if we can find Jex's hairstyle.
[2644.23s -> 2644.55s]  And that's...
[2647.43s -> 2649.19s]  Anything like him at all.
[2650.79s -> 2651.75s]  Owen Wilson.
[2670.02s -> 2671.54s]  Okay, this is it.
[2671.54s -> 2672.42s]  I like this one.
[2674.57s -> 2675.21s]  He-Man.
[2679.94s -> 2680.66s]  He-Man.
[2688.62s -> 2689.74s]  Lois Griffin.
[2694.82s -> 2695.62s]  No, it's not Lois.
[2695.62s -> 2696.82s]  Oh, it's a ponytail.
[2697.46s -> 2698.34s]  I gotta change that.
[2713.98s -> 2715.66s]  I think it's just gonna have to be this.
[2721.50s -> 2724.06s]  That's not Jex.
[2724.06s -> 2724.78s]  No, it isn't.
[2729.61s -> 2730.65s]  There we go, all right.
[2733.78s -> 2734.98s]  He's got a different fit.
[2734.98s -> 2735.54s]  Okay, that's...
[2747.42s -> 2747.98s]  I like it.
[2747.98s -> 2748.86s]  It's staying.
[2749.58s -> 2760.23s]  This is oblivion Jex.
[2761.11s -> 2782.20s]  Here we go.
[2782.20s -> 2782.92s]  A little bit less.
[2783.80s -> 2792.55s]  Oh, this is teeth in or teeth out.
[2796.10s -> 2796.90s]  All right.
[2801.27s -> 2802.95s]  Down here we got jaw.
[2819.67s -> 2823.43s]  Not really that close, but I think close enough.
[2842.94s -> 2843.82s]  It's the fucking hair.
[2844.54s -> 2849.27s]  I can't even see the ears anyways.
[2849.83s -> 2853.11s]  Looks good.
[2865.98s -> 2874.15s]  Huge head.
[2874.15s -> 2875.35s]  Turn on face cam.
[2878.26s -> 2880.10s]  No, he's not a fucking cone head.
[2880.10s -> 2883.00s]  All right, hold on.
[2883.00s -> 2884.04s]  Let me go back to the hair.
[2884.60s -> 2885.80s]  The hair is just killing this.
[2886.44s -> 2899.40s]  He looks like an emo singer.
[2905.67s -> 2907.51s]  He's got a huge head.
[2907.51s -> 2912.86s]  His head's not that huge, is it?
[2919.03s -> 2920.15s]  This is John.
[2937.70s -> 2939.38s]  E-emo John.
[2939.94s -> 2949.14s]  His head's too big.
[2949.14s -> 2950.18s]  It looks ridiculous.
[2966.39s -> 2967.59s]  All right, hold on.
[2968.65s -> 2969.05s]  This is...
[2969.05s -> 2969.53s]  I don't know.
[2980.97s -> 2984.15s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2984.15s -> 2984.79s]  What just happened?
[2985.35s -> 2986.71s]  Okay.
[2986.71s -> 2987.19s]  No, what?
[2991.83s -> 2993.43s]  Wait, how do I save this?
[2996.15s -> 2996.95s]  Is he saved?
[3004.68s -> 3005.56s]  Oh, save.
[3005.56s -> 3006.28s]  Okay.
[3006.28s -> 3013.58s]  Okay, save.
[3014.97s -> 3015.29s]  Load.
[3015.93s -> 3018.10s]  Okay, so this is...
[3018.10s -> 3019.06s]  We can rename...
[3019.06s -> 3022.58s]  We're gonna rename him.
[3022.58s -> 3023.38s]  Oh, fuck this.
[3024.58s -> 3026.26s]  I can't rename him.
[3027.86s -> 3029.14s]  Okay, it's all right.
[3029.14s -> 3029.70s]  It's okay.
[3031.18s -> 3032.46s]  I can rename him later.
[3036.84s -> 3037.96s]  Wait, could I?
[3037.96s -> 3042.30s]  Was there a rename?
[3057.11s -> 3059.43s]  No, I can do it in the change costume.
[3059.99s -> 3068.57s]  Okay, create actor.
[3078.68s -> 3079.32s]  Let's go...
[3079.32s -> 3080.12s]  This is me.
[3080.12s -> 3085.43s]  Let's get the hair right.
[3086.84s -> 3087.64s]  I'm actually gonna...
[3087.64s -> 3089.16s]  I'm not doing like the bald fucking head.
[3089.72s -> 3091.27s]  This is...
[3091.27s -> 3093.27s]  I'm gonna get my actual hair.
[3093.27s -> 3094.15s]  I mean, that's pretty...
[3094.15s -> 3095.11s]  That's pretty close.
[3095.75s -> 3097.19s]  No, it's not, but whatever.
[3097.19s -> 3105.32s]  Looks fine.
[3117.35s -> 3119.11s]  That's a little extreme.
[3119.11s -> 3137.06s]  Okay.
[3137.06s -> 3139.22s]  My eyes are always like wide open.
[3139.22s -> 3154.30s]  My mouth is out a little.
[3154.30s -> 3156.52s]  I'm usually pretty happy.
[3160.87s -> 3162.55s]  This looks like Mark Zuckerberg.
[3167.03s -> 3173.26s]  Whatever.
[3173.26s -> 3177.88s]  That's like every image you've ever seen
[3177.88s -> 3179.48s]  of Mark Zuckerberg's face.
[3179.48s -> 3186.46s]  All right, pull the chin back.
[3186.46s -> 3191.62s]  I don't have that big of a chin.
[3191.62s -> 3193.13s]  I kind of have a turkey neck.
[3193.13s -> 3200.94s]  Let's pull the cheeks in.
[3200.94s -> 3208.62s]  They're not that...
[3208.62s -> 3209.98s]  They're shorter than that.
[3209.98s -> 3214.46s]  I got a big eyebrow bone.
[3214.46s -> 3223.62s]  It looks good.
[3223.62s -> 3234.12s]  I kind of have like a skinny head like that.
[3234.12s -> 3234.68s]  Okay.
[3234.68s -> 3235.32s]  All right.
[3235.32s -> 3237.82s]  I gotta change the eyes.
[3237.82s -> 3239.35s]  You have a...
[3239.35s -> 3240.71s]  It's a small brain.
[3240.71s -> 3244.68s]  What do you mean small brain?
[3247.34s -> 3248.14s]  Change the hair.
[3248.14s -> 3249.42s]  What's wrong with the hair?
[3249.42s -> 3251.34s]  That is the hair that I have right now.
[3251.34s -> 3259.62s]  What do you mean change the hair?
[3259.62s -> 3259.94s]  That is...
[3259.94s -> 3260.98s]  That is my hair.
[3260.98s -> 3261.62s]  My current...
[3261.62s -> 3262.58s]  Right now, my hair.
[3263.58s -> 3264.54s]  Oh, God.
[3264.54s -> 3274.06s]  That's actually pretty...
[3274.06s -> 3284.36s]  That's actually better.
[3284.36s -> 3285.64s]  I'm not gonna do this.
[3285.64s -> 3287.80s]  Like this is just fucking nuts.
[3287.80s -> 3289.58s]  I'm not doing this one.
[3289.58s -> 3291.02s]  Everyone's gonna want me to do this one.
[3291.58s -> 3294.17s]  But come on.
[3294.17s -> 3295.05s]  This is too easy.
[3295.05s -> 3296.49s]  This is so easy.
[3296.49s -> 3309.19s]  This is like every wrestler from the 90s haircut.
[3309.19s -> 3310.23s]  Like I don't want to do...
[3310.23s -> 3311.59s]  I do this every time.
[3323.22s -> 3324.02s]  Do my...
[3324.02s -> 3325.54s]  I'm gonna do my actual hair.
[3327.94s -> 3328.50s]  This is it.
[3341.34s -> 3343.50s]  Unless they have one of the other ones like when it's short.
[3343.50s -> 3344.22s]  It's not that.
[3346.68s -> 3347.56s]  It's not that either.
[3347.56s -> 3348.60s]  I don't have like the M.
[3357.69s -> 3358.89s]  Can I change his name?
[3358.89s -> 3359.45s]  I'm sure...
[3359.45s -> 3361.37s]  Can I change his name to Mark Zuckerberg?
[3361.37s -> 3362.09s]  This is not even me.
[3362.09s -> 3362.97s]  This is Mark Zuckerberg.
[3362.97s -> 3364.97s]  We're gonna have Zuckerberg be in our movies.
[3364.97s -> 3365.53s]  This is...
[3365.53s -> 3365.93s]  I don't care.
[3365.93s -> 3366.41s]  I'm done.
[3366.41s -> 3366.97s]  This is gonna be...
[3366.97s -> 3379.69s]  This is Mark Zuckerberg.
[3379.69s -> 3381.53s]  What color is his hair?
[3381.61s -> 3388.94s]  It's his red.
[3389.58s -> 3391.02s]  Mark Zuckerberg has red hair.
[3397.48s -> 3404.63s]  Yeah, he has the facial expressions too.
[3404.63s -> 3405.83s]  His hair's not green.
[3416.87s -> 3418.07s]  Yeah, it's like this.
[3418.07s -> 3419.03s]  That's fine.
[3419.03s -> 3429.16s]  Okay, that looks good.
[3429.16s -> 3430.28s]  What the fuck?
[3430.84s -> 3431.80s]  Why is this...
[3432.44s -> 3432.84s]  This is...
[3432.84s -> 3433.56s]  I don't even want...
[3433.56s -> 3434.68s]  I want to change this.
[3437.99s -> 3439.19s]  I swear to God.
[3439.91s -> 3447.11s]  All right.
[3447.11s -> 3448.47s]  Can I make me know?
[3448.47s -> 3449.51s]  Or should I make...
[3449.51s -> 3450.23s]  All right.
[3450.23s -> 3472.78s]  I just keep it like this.
[3474.94s -> 3475.58s]  Just do...
[3475.58s -> 3476.14s]  That's it.
[3476.14s -> 3477.10s]  This is Adam Sandler.
[3479.18s -> 3480.38s]  It's Bobby Hill.
[3481.48s -> 3481.72s]  No.
[3482.20s -> 3483.32s]  I can't have like all these...
[3487.48s -> 3491.61s]  They all have the wrong name.
[3491.61s -> 3516.04s]  No, this is Adam Sandler.
[3516.04s -> 3544.66s]  What do Adam Sandler's ears look like?
[3544.66s -> 3545.22s]  Fix the hair?
[3545.22s -> 3545.54s]  I will.
[3545.54s -> 3545.78s]  I will.
[3545.78s -> 3546.26s]  Just hold on.
[3546.26s -> 3570.82s]  Hold on.
[3570.82s -> 3571.22s]  Okay.
[3576.20s -> 3577.40s]  No, I gotta read...
[3577.40s -> 3578.28s]  This is gonna be like...
[3581.37s -> 3582.79s]  I don't know.
[3582.79s -> 3586.54s]  I'm like the Anvil.
[3592.49s -> 3593.61s]  Anthony Anvil.
[3599.29s -> 3601.06s]  Anvil Sandler.
[3601.06s -> 3601.54s]  All right.
[3601.54s -> 3602.74s]  Yeah, I like it.
[3602.74s -> 3603.69s]  Good job.
[3603.69s -> 3604.33s]  Good work.
[3604.33s -> 3610.36s]  Yeah, we can't...
[3610.36s -> 3612.92s]  We gotta like get rid of the fucking real people, man.
[3612.92s -> 3615.78s]  This is like Arthur Cube brain.
[3615.78s -> 3639.48s]  Look at that profile.
[3644.76s -> 3650.70s]  Okay, eyes.
[3650.70s -> 3651.90s]  We're gonna change these eyes.
[3651.90s -> 3666.89s]  Okay, this might be the best person.
[3671.10s -> 3673.82s]  It's somebody in a silicone mask.
[3676.92s -> 3677.80s]  That's what this is.
[3677.80s -> 3681.10s]  This is B.F. Bugleberry levels of person.
[3681.10s -> 3683.18s]  This is a person in a silicone rubber mask.
[3711.14s -> 3711.70s]  This is...
[3711.70s -> 3712.42s]  Okay.
[3712.42s -> 3712.90s]  All right.
[3712.90s -> 3713.30s]  All right.
[3713.30s -> 3713.78s]  All right.
[3713.78s -> 3714.34s]  All right.
[3714.34s -> 3715.14s]  All right.
[3715.14s -> 3716.79s]  I think that's good.
[3716.79s -> 3731.35s]  Now, is the hair the right...
[3731.35s -> 3732.07s]  Okay.
[3732.07s -> 3733.03s]  Which hair is this?
[3733.03s -> 3734.15s]  I think the hair is perfect.
[3734.23s -> 3744.04s]  I don't think I want to change anything.
[3744.04s -> 3755.66s]  Oh, I forgot to do the stats.
[3785.94s -> 3786.50s]  Anvil.
[3791.99s -> 3792.95s]  The Anvil.
[3792.95s -> 3796.95s]  All right.
[3796.95s -> 3798.98s]  That looks good.
[3798.98s -> 3800.42s]  Everything looks set from here.
[3800.42s -> 3800.98s]  I'm not...
[3800.98s -> 3813.18s]  The hair is, I think, perfect.
[3813.18s -> 3813.50s]  All right.
[3813.50s -> 3815.50s]  Hopefully, I can change these names.
[3815.50s -> 3818.30s]  Otherwise, it's going to be a very odd...
[3818.30s -> 3819.58s]  A very odd world here.
[3823.14s -> 3823.46s]  All right.
[3823.46s -> 3824.42s]  We'll make a couple more.
[3824.42s -> 3824.82s]  Let's do...
[3825.70s -> 3828.68s]  I gotta get...
[3828.68s -> 3829.08s]  Okay.
[3829.08s -> 3830.04s]  We keep making people,
[3830.04s -> 3832.28s]  and then we make them look way different
[3832.28s -> 3833.08s]  than where they're named,
[3833.08s -> 3834.12s]  and then I have to rename them.
[3840.98s -> 3841.86s]  How about...
[3842.18s -> 3842.58s]  Betty.
[3843.38s -> 3844.42s]  It could be anything.
[3844.42s -> 3845.78s]  Betty can be anything.
[3845.78s -> 3847.05s]  Could be anything.
[3882.94s -> 3885.34s]  Consistently just doing the people's eyebrow.
[3890.97s -> 3896.10s]  Let's get down here.
[3896.10s -> 3899.88s]  She looks drunk.
[3906.57s -> 3908.78s]  I don't know.
[3908.78s -> 3917.46s]  Betty could be anything.
[3917.46s -> 3918.82s]  Turning into a Simpsons character
[3918.82s -> 3920.10s]  is what's happening here.
[3920.10s -> 3947.30s]  Too much...
[3947.30s -> 3948.58s]  That's too much skin.
[3948.58s -> 3960.50s]  Betty the Brick.
[3960.50s -> 3961.06s]  Oh, I mean...
[3962.10s -> 3963.22s]  Betty the Goldfish?
[3967.48s -> 3970.38s]  I can't even say it.
[3970.38s -> 3971.42s]  Nobody said...
[3972.14s -> 3973.98s]  RuneScape NPC.
[3975.11s -> 3976.87s]  Well, I don't even play RuneScape.
[3976.87s -> 3978.39s]  Why do I know what that looks like?
[3982.82s -> 3984.58s]  I don't even know what that means,
[3984.58s -> 3985.70s]  and I know what it means.
[3986.70s -> 3994.31s]  That's the odd thing.
[3994.31s -> 3995.51s]  I can see it.
[3995.51s -> 4013.21s]  Betty RuneScape.
[4013.21s -> 4014.73s]  That's so fucking ridiculous.
[4017.64s -> 4018.12s]  Okay.
[4018.12s -> 4023.53s]  All right.
[4023.53s -> 4023.93s]  Hair.
[4025.94s -> 4027.70s]  I don't know if I want to change the hair.
[4027.70s -> 4041.13s]  All right.
[4041.13s -> 4042.73s]  This, weirdly enough, this is like...
[4050.58s -> 4054.50s]  This is like Dollar Store Daenerys Targaryen.
[4054.50s -> 4072.66s]  I think I like the RuneScape hair.
[4072.66s -> 4078.41s]  All right.
[4078.41s -> 4081.21s]  Where's the RuneScape NPC hair?
[4081.21s -> 4091.67s]  Where is it?
[4096.82s -> 4097.54s]  Look at all this.
[4108.62s -> 4110.30s]  Where is that hair?
[4110.30s -> 4112.18s]  It's very important.
[4112.18s -> 4112.90s]  That's not it.
[4112.90s -> 4113.86s]  I lost it.
[4113.86s -> 4120.15s]  There it is.
[4133.93s -> 4138.36s]  This is going to be so stupid.
[4138.36s -> 4147.74s]  Looks good.
[4150.89s -> 4153.51s]  No.
[4153.51s -> 4154.71s]  No.
[4154.71s -> 4155.99s]  That's just the way it is.
[4157.05s -> 4157.37s]  Okay.
[4157.37s -> 4158.01s]  This is Betty.
[4163.62s -> 4164.26s]  All right.
[4164.26s -> 4164.66s]  Uh...
[4165.38s -> 4165.86s]  Action.
[4165.86s -> 4166.34s]  Comedy.
[4166.90s -> 4169.06s]  Let's just do a perfectly balanced...
[4184.34s -> 4186.95s]  All right.
[4186.95s -> 4187.43s]  That's good.
[4189.43s -> 4189.83s]  Yes.
[4189.83s -> 4190.07s]  Yes.
[4190.07s -> 4190.55s]  That's the thing.
[4190.55s -> 4190.87s]  Yes.
[4190.87s -> 4191.19s]  Yes.
[4191.19s -> 4191.59s]  Of course.
[4192.46s -> 4192.86s]  All right.
[4192.86s -> 4193.18s]  Save it.
[4194.57s -> 4194.97s]  Save.
[4196.42s -> 4197.61s]  All right.
[4197.61s -> 4202.65s]  Now, let's do two more.
[4203.21s -> 4203.69s]  Actor.
[4205.64s -> 4206.76s]  This is now going to be...
[4217.30s -> 4218.58s]  Make Todd Howard.
[4219.82s -> 4220.30s]  Todd.
[4220.30s -> 4220.62s]  Todd.
[4220.62s -> 4221.02s]  Todd.
[4221.02s -> 4221.26s]  Todd.
[4221.26s -> 4221.58s]  Todd.
[4221.58s -> 4221.98s]  Todd.
[4221.98s -> 4222.30s]  Todd.
[4222.30s -> 4222.70s]  Todd.
[4222.70s -> 4223.10s]  Todd.
[4223.10s -> 4223.50s]  Todd.
[4223.50s -> 4224.92s]  Todd.
[4224.92s -> 4225.32s]  Todd.
[4231.32s -> 4232.84s]  Why is everybody like...
[4232.84s -> 4238.52s]  Why do you want Todd Howard?
[4238.52s -> 4239.96s]  How about just Howard?
[4239.96s -> 4288.74s]  Okay.
[4288.74s -> 4290.58s]  Todd Howard is not 38.
[4290.58s -> 4292.34s]  He's like 47.
[4292.34s -> 4294.14s]  How old is Todd Howard?
[4294.14s -> 4295.66s]  That's 47?
[4295.66s -> 4298.47s]  That looks way older than 47.
[4298.47s -> 4299.27s]  I'm close to the...
[4299.27s -> 4299.99s]  Hold on.
[4299.99s -> 4310.46s]  That's not how old people look when they're 42.
[4310.46s -> 4315.29s]  Am I going to just go down a straight 90-degree edge
[4315.29s -> 4322.36s]  in like the next three years?
[4322.36s -> 4323.00s]  No.
[4323.00s -> 4323.56s]  No, I'm not.
[4342.57s -> 4343.29s]  Okay.
[4343.29s -> 4343.93s]  I think we're good.
[4344.73s -> 4362.81s]  Like, this could be the person that you want it to be,
[4362.81s -> 4364.33s]  but that's not who this is.
[4375.26s -> 4375.66s]  It's not.
[4376.38s -> 4395.10s]  All right.
[4395.10s -> 4395.90s]  In the middle is fine.
[4396.86s -> 4412.79s]  It kind of looks like me.
[4412.79s -> 4413.43s]  Weird.
[4413.43s -> 4416.01s]  I'm just starting to really actually look like me.
[4416.65s -> 4435.58s]  This is me.
[4445.58s -> 4447.82s]  That's looking a little weird, isn't it?
[4447.82s -> 4449.02s]  At least in my opinion.
[4449.02s -> 4468.57s]  It's like Disney animated version me.
[4468.57s -> 4474.26s]  Go like this.
[4478.07s -> 4480.23s]  Or like face scan me.
[4480.23s -> 4483.78s]  What about the hair?
[4483.78s -> 4485.94s]  Hopefully I can rename all these people.
[4485.94s -> 4513.99s]  Otherwise, this is going to be a joke.
[4513.99s -> 4514.55s]  Maybe not.
[4515.59s -> 4521.56s]  Do I not even know what I look like?
[4521.56s -> 4527.62s]  2012, Jerma.
[4527.62s -> 4528.18s]  It could be.
[4544.17s -> 4547.08s]  This is like good boy, Jerma.
[4547.08s -> 4547.64s]  Yeah, this is...
[4547.64s -> 4549.72s]  Okay, I kind of like good boy.
[4549.72s -> 4553.98s]  This is like...
[4555.99s -> 4558.15s]  How many different good boys are there?
[4558.15s -> 4561.51s]  Is there another version?
[4561.51s -> 4564.98s]  This is pretty fucking close.
[4569.96s -> 4580.86s]  Should I do no country for old men, Jerma?
[4580.86s -> 4593.66s]  These are all so many different versions of me.
[4594.46s -> 4595.02s]  I gotta...
[4595.02s -> 4597.94s]  Hopefully, to God, I can rename them.
[4597.94s -> 4600.34s]  I think I like missed a good boy.
[4600.34s -> 4604.26s]  Where is it?
[4604.26s -> 4614.71s]  Hairy fucking neck.
[4614.71s -> 4637.46s]  Okay, that looks good.
[4637.46s -> 4638.58s]  I'm so stressed.
[4640.89s -> 4656.70s]  All right, looks good.
[4656.70s -> 4661.85s]  All right, one more.
[4662.57s -> 4664.57s]  Who do we even have?
[4664.57s -> 4668.76s]  We have Andrew the Anvil.
[4668.76s -> 4669.40s]  We have...
[4669.40s -> 4670.95s]  Who's that supposed to be?
[4670.95s -> 4673.51s]  Mark Zuckerberg?
[4673.51s -> 4674.01s]  We have...
[4676.25s -> 4679.24s]  John Howard.
[4679.24s -> 4680.84s]  These are all so wrong.
[4680.84s -> 4681.64s]  I can't change them.
[4681.64s -> 4682.04s]  It's going to be...
[4682.04s -> 4692.15s]  We're going to be fucked.
[4692.15s -> 4693.03s]  All right, this is it.
[4693.03s -> 4718.60s]  Give me like...
[4718.60s -> 4745.48s]  No, there we go.
[4745.48s -> 4746.20s]  65.
[4746.20s -> 4747.48s]  You look like 100.
[4747.48s -> 4758.39s]  All right, that's fine.
[4758.39s -> 4759.03s]  All right, last one.
[4759.03s -> 4759.67s]  Here we go.
[4759.67s -> 4776.42s]  Wait, I need hair.
[4776.42s -> 4795.00s]  Give him a long nose.
[4795.56s -> 4797.24s]  Why would he have a long nose?
[4800.49s -> 4801.13s]  Not bad.
[4801.13s -> 4840.74s]  I don't understand the teeth part.
[4840.74s -> 4842.18s]  Not bad so far.
[4842.18s -> 4849.59s]  Pop the cheeks out a little bit.
[4849.59s -> 4850.63s]  Ears are fine.
[4850.63s -> 4860.23s]  What's going on with his mouth?
[4860.23s -> 4861.35s]  I don't know what is happening
[4861.35s -> 4862.95s]  with his mouth here, but whatever.
[4862.95s -> 4879.24s]  Looks good.
[4879.80s -> 4884.20s]  Give him a big nose.
[4884.20s -> 4892.41s]  No, I'm not going to give...
[4892.41s -> 4896.17s]  No, everybody doesn't need a big fucking honker.
[4916.18s -> 4916.90s]  I like him.
[4916.90s -> 4929.75s]  Okay, stats.
[4929.75s -> 4930.07s]  Hair.
[4930.07s -> 4933.34s]  Let me just make sure.
[4933.34s -> 4934.14s]  Much better.
[4934.14s -> 4945.08s]  Much better.
[4945.08s -> 4946.63s]  Okay.
[4946.63s -> 4947.35s]  All right, stats.
[4947.35s -> 4953.14s]  Let's do pretty balanced.
[4953.14s -> 4976.86s]  I kind of like this more.
[4976.86s -> 4978.94s]  Oh shit, here comes the police.
[4978.94s -> 4985.34s]  Look at all this neck hair.
[4985.34s -> 4990.42s]  Yeah, I don't know why that's there.
[4990.42s -> 4991.06s]  That's good.
[4991.06s -> 5003.59s]  Should we have him like with a mustache?
[5003.59s -> 5015.35s]  How about a beard?
[5015.35s -> 5022.54s]  I don't hate this.
[5028.87s -> 5038.30s]  Why is this Leo P pants?
[5038.30s -> 5041.85s]  No, clean shave is fine.
[5041.85s -> 5044.71s]  All right, it's time to make the studio.
[5044.71s -> 5046.49s]  It's time to play the game.
[5046.49s -> 5054.31s]  I'm ready, but hold on.
[5054.31s -> 5056.01s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5056.01s -> 5058.38s]  Leo Howard, which is me.
[5059.02s -> 5060.81s]  Betty, which is Betty.
[5060.81s -> 5064.76s]  Adam Sandliff, which is Adam Anvil.
[5064.76s -> 5069.18s]  Jeremy is actually Zuckerberg.
[5069.18s -> 5071.18s]  And then Jax is actually John.
[5071.18s -> 5071.82s]  We need to make...
[5071.82s -> 5072.62s]  Hold on.
[5072.62s -> 5074.25s]  We actually have to make a Jax.
[5075.05s -> 5076.01s]  This is actually...
[5076.01s -> 5077.13s]  This is the real Jax now.
[5077.13s -> 5098.95s]  Is it 18?
[5098.95s -> 5100.31s]  I don't think this person is 18.
[5127.13s -> 5128.49s]  Can I see some Jax's in the chat, please?
[5128.49s -> 5130.01s]  So I can get a good reference here.
[5130.01s -> 5144.76s]  This needs to be like a little sweet.
[5144.76s -> 5146.52s]  Like this one here.
[5146.52s -> 5157.56s]  No, different one.
[5157.56s -> 5159.16s]  This is just Fred from Scooby-Doo.
[5159.16s -> 5171.58s]  That's not who I'm trying to make here.
[5172.54s -> 5174.14s]  I think I want it to be this.
[5174.14s -> 5188.39s]  I think this just is what it's going to be.
[5188.39s -> 5190.15s]  This is so ugly.
[5190.15s -> 5190.63s]  What do you mean?
[5191.35s -> 5196.20s]  Did you see the last five characters
[5196.20s -> 5197.80s]  that I made in the game?
[5197.80s -> 5211.83s]  This is close.
[5217.78s -> 5233.27s]  I mean, he's going to have a huge jaw.
[5233.27s -> 5242.58s]  Let's do the jaw first.
[5242.58s -> 5271.21s]  I'm going to pull the cheeks in here.
[5271.21s -> 5294.30s]  All right, looks good.
[5304.30s -> 5305.98s]  That makes him look bogged enough.
[5342.98s -> 5344.66s]  This doctor's strange.
[5344.66s -> 5345.54s]  This is the doctor...
[5345.54s -> 5347.46s]  Okay, cover the screen with your hand.
[5347.98s -> 5351.22s]  I'm making Benedict...
[5351.22s -> 5352.10s]  What's his name?
[5352.10s -> 5362.39s]  No, not Benedict Arnold.
[5362.39s -> 5365.38s]  There we go.
[5365.38s -> 5369.99s]  Nice.
[5369.99s -> 5371.51s]  Just constantly fucking squinting.
[5371.51s -> 5374.10s]  Just constantly.
[5374.10s -> 5374.90s]  I'm a pro.
[5374.90s -> 5387.26s]  Okay.
[5387.26s -> 5390.01s]  I need to bring in the cheeks.
[5390.01s -> 5391.37s]  I wish I could bring these cheeks in.
[5410.30s -> 5411.98s]  This is so ugly.
[5411.98s -> 5413.18s]  Somebody in the chat just says,
[5413.18s -> 5415.10s]  this is so ugly.
[5415.10s -> 5416.38s]  Please don't do that.
[5452.57s -> 5453.69s]  I kind of hate this.
[5453.69s -> 5455.61s]  But at the same time, I kind of like it.
[5455.61s -> 5472.78s]  All right, that's it.
[5472.78s -> 5473.66s]  No more characters.
[5473.66s -> 5474.06s]  Let's go.
[5483.98s -> 5485.02s]  Nothing else matters.
[5485.02s -> 5500.94s]  This is Matt Damon.
[5504.76s -> 5505.32s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[5505.32s -> 5506.12s]  Maybe it'll tell me...
[5506.12s -> 5508.52s]  Oh, hey, you can't use that name.
[5508.52s -> 5517.22s]  All right, we're ready to go.
[5518.82s -> 5520.50s]  So many Jeremy's that...
[5521.54s -> 5523.22s]  Don't worry, they're going to be replaced.
[5523.22s -> 5534.49s]  All right, done.
[5534.49s -> 5538.20s]  They're all Jeremy.
[5538.20s -> 5539.16s]  And don't worry, we're going to get...
[5539.72s -> 5541.16s]  I don't want all created characters
[5541.16s -> 5543.00s]  because there's going to be other characters
[5543.00s -> 5544.04s]  that come up through the rankings
[5544.04s -> 5546.62s]  that we think are cool.
[5546.62s -> 5549.34s]  So everybody's done.
[5549.34s -> 5558.42s]  Let's go.
[5558.42s -> 5563.67s]  I think I can just close this, right?
[5568.15s -> 5568.87s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5569.59s -> 5570.95s]  So I don't think...
[5570.95s -> 5572.95s]  Where do you pull those people up from?
[5573.59s -> 5584.65s]  I don't know.
[5584.65s -> 5585.85s]  Let me just reopen the game.
[5587.58s -> 5588.22s]  I got the...
[5588.22s -> 5589.50s]  Yeah, I have a default background.
[5589.50s -> 5589.98s]  It's all right.
[5590.70s -> 5601.06s]  What do you want me to have in my background?
[5601.06s -> 5604.97s]  What would you rather me have?
[5605.53s -> 5617.42s]  All right, let's go.
[5619.29s -> 5622.89s]  Time to create actual pee pants liquidated.
[5633.43s -> 5634.15s]  All right, game.
[5635.66s -> 5636.78s]  Sandbox.
[5636.78s -> 5642.76s]  It's time.
[5642.76s -> 5644.04s]  Game starts in...
[5645.40s -> 5647.08s]  1950 is fine.
[5647.08s -> 5648.12s]  I get $100 million.
[5648.52s -> 5655.08s]  The building's constructed instantly.
[5657.00s -> 5658.20s]  Buildings don't decay.
[5658.76s -> 5664.38s]  Start with the studio a lot already.
[5664.38s -> 5666.14s]  So we don't have to go through all that.
[5666.14s -> 5670.87s]  Take the money and run.
[5670.87s -> 5672.23s]  Just create it and then leave.
[5675.10s -> 5675.82s]  All right, here we go.
[5678.15s -> 5679.03s]  Instant movie making.
[5679.03s -> 5679.75s]  I forget if that's...
[5681.08s -> 5682.60s]  I think, yeah, they just get shot
[5682.60s -> 5683.80s]  and we can edit them.
[5683.80s -> 5686.52s]  Yeah, there's no audio because I have it turned off
[5686.52s -> 5688.20s]  because it's really loud in the menu.
[5690.76s -> 5691.72s]  Stars don't misbehave.
[5692.28s -> 5693.00s]  That's fine.
[5695.94s -> 5696.90s]  Buildings don't decay.
[5697.62s -> 5698.87s]  Here we go.
[5700.71s -> 5703.75s]  Game starts in 1950 so gives us some opportunity.
[5704.95s -> 5709.03s]  $100 million in 1950 is like $100 billion now.
[5710.60s -> 5711.40s]  Let's go.
[5711.40s -> 5720.86s]  Pee pants.
[5721.66s -> 5725.85s]  Pee pants liquidated.
[5725.85s -> 5728.18s]  Where is it?
[5728.82s -> 5735.46s]  And I'm Jeremy.
[5735.46s -> 5735.86s]  That's me.
[5739.90s -> 5740.38s]  Let's go.
[5742.73s -> 5749.45s]  Time to make a movie.
[5749.45s -> 5751.21s]  So we need to have...
[5751.21s -> 5752.73s]  Who's going to be the director?
[5752.73s -> 5756.07s]  And how do we bring people in?
[5756.07s -> 5762.58s]  How do we load characters in?
[5762.58s -> 5763.78s]  Are they just going to be in the game?
[5764.34s -> 5770.25s]  I'm not sure.
[5770.81s -> 5771.85s]  Did I even make anybody?
[5782.12s -> 5782.84s]  Yeah, where's like...
[5782.84s -> 5784.68s]  Is there like an import character feature?
[5785.48s -> 5786.68s]  Create, Builder, Fire.
[5786.68s -> 5787.08s]  Hold on.
[5789.00s -> 5789.40s]  Release.
[5791.18s -> 5791.42s]  Bar.
[5794.76s -> 5795.40s]  Import star.
[5795.40s -> 5795.80s]  Here we go.
[5795.80s -> 5796.04s]  Okay.
[5796.84s -> 5798.12s]  So I think we just have to drag
[5798.12s -> 5799.72s]  like somebody over here, right?
[5800.74s -> 5801.14s]  Yeah.
[5801.14s -> 5801.46s]  All right.

[5803.85s -> 5805.05s]  Okay, so let's bring...
[5805.05s -> 5809.14s]  I got to rename them though.
[5809.14s -> 5809.78s]  This Jex.
[5810.97s -> 5811.45s]  All right, Jex.
[5811.45s -> 5812.41s]  We're going to do a makeover.
[5813.21s -> 5814.25s]  You are just Jex.
[5814.25s -> 5814.73s]  That's fine.
[5815.45s -> 5819.16s]  Bring in Leo.
[5822.44s -> 5822.84s]  Bring in...
[5823.48s -> 5823.88s]  I don't...
[5823.88s -> 5824.28s]  Howard?
[5826.63s -> 5827.67s]  But who's going to direct?
[5829.46s -> 5829.86s]  Betty.
[5835.34s -> 5838.06s]  Should I just make this like Zuckerberg?
[5838.06s -> 5840.14s]  I'm just going to make this the director.
[5840.14s -> 5848.92s]  Okay, these are all everyone's waiting.
[5850.23s -> 5851.43s]  Make me the director.
[5854.76s -> 5856.44s]  Oh, I can't have any more actors.
[5857.72s -> 5858.28s]  Oh, shit.
[5859.77s -> 5860.57s]  Who do we fire?
[5861.77s -> 5863.29s]  Who's the worst out of all these?
[5866.09s -> 5867.37s]  Who's the worst actor?
[5870.42s -> 5871.46s]  No, Betty is staying.
[5872.33s -> 5873.13s]  Is it Howard?
[5875.80s -> 5877.16s]  I think Howard just has to be...
[5877.80s -> 5879.48s]  Howard just has to be the director.
[5883.98s -> 5884.78s]  Howard sucks.
[5885.42s -> 5889.13s]  All right.
[5889.13s -> 5890.01s]  Howard's director.
[5890.65s -> 5896.14s]  Are they all directors?
[5896.14s -> 5896.38s]  No.
[5897.02s -> 5898.71s]  No, they're not.
[5898.71s -> 5900.39s]  Okay, I can't have any more people.
[5901.19s -> 5904.28s]  Who am I missing?
[5904.28s -> 5907.08s]  I don't care if I'm missing like the emo John.
[5907.96s -> 5909.86s]  All right, so let's make a set.
[5911.62s -> 5912.58s]  Let's get a...
[5912.58s -> 5914.02s]  Let's do like a movie.
[5914.02s -> 5914.50s]  Let me just...
[5914.50s -> 5916.50s]  I got to see if I remember how the fuck to even do all this shit.
[5918.71s -> 5920.39s]  Here, a bunch of janitors.
[5928.50s -> 5929.46s]  That's the most jan...
[5929.46s -> 5930.58s]  I can't have any more janitors.
[5931.91s -> 5932.71s]  So let's...
[5932.71s -> 5933.59s]  It's script, right?
[5934.23s -> 5936.33s]  Who is the script house?
[5936.33s -> 5937.13s]  Casting office.
[5938.09s -> 5939.37s]  Begin casting crew.
[5939.37s -> 5939.77s]  Shoot it.
[5939.77s -> 5941.21s]  I need the script office.
[5942.97s -> 5943.69s]  Make some crew.
[5945.61s -> 5950.86s]  And let's also make some extras.
[5952.47s -> 5955.91s]  Can I...
[5955.91s -> 5956.55s]  Can I not make...
[5956.55s -> 5958.07s]  How many extras?
[5959.96s -> 5960.84s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[5960.84s -> 5961.08s]  Okay.
[5961.88s -> 5962.98s]  Is this it?
[5963.62s -> 5965.14s]  This is the makeover department.
[5965.14s -> 5965.94s]  This is the trailer.
[5966.90s -> 5968.62s]  Give us John.
[5968.62s -> 5970.22s]  Well, somebody has to go.
[5970.22s -> 5971.98s]  Somebody has to be fired completely.
[5972.62s -> 5978.06s]  Custom script building.
[5978.06s -> 5980.06s]  But isn't that in a certain office?
[5981.18s -> 5981.74s]  Script office.
[5981.74s -> 5982.22s]  Here we go.
[5982.22s -> 5982.46s]  Okay.
[5984.55s -> 5986.07s]  So now I want to do...
[5986.07s -> 5987.67s]  I don't know what that means either.
[5987.67s -> 5990.78s]  Oh, is this mainstream pan movie making?
[5991.42s -> 5992.14s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5992.14s -> 5993.34s]  I need to grab a...
[5994.14s -> 5996.22s]  I got to start making a movie and then put it over here.
[6002.87s -> 6003.75s]  My god damn it.
[6003.75s -> 6004.31s]  This is like just...
[6005.11s -> 6011.40s]  I got to bring you to over here, right?
[6012.28s -> 6013.48s]  I need to make a script.
[6013.48s -> 6015.08s]  But how do I make a script?
[6017.32s -> 6018.84s]  Don't I need like a screenwriter?
[6018.84s -> 6020.36s]  How about just like let's do comedy.
[6023.72s -> 6024.92s]  And then script.
[6028.86s -> 6031.32s]  How do I like edit this?
[6032.12s -> 6037.82s]  This thing is called alpha male.
[6038.54s -> 6046.36s]  This is where the tutorial would have been better.
[6046.36s -> 6047.64s]  Should remember how to do all this.
[6047.64s -> 6048.92s]  You bring this somewhere, don't you?
[6049.80s -> 6051.69s]  Custom script building.
[6052.41s -> 6053.80s]  Is that in a separate...
[6053.80s -> 6055.56s]  Is that a different studio building?
[6056.44s -> 6057.35s]  Oh, it's a...
[6057.35s -> 6058.47s]  Yeah, it's not even here.
[6058.47s -> 6058.97s]  Okay.
[6060.97s -> 6064.74s]  How can I put it?
[6072.07s -> 6073.03s]  Custom script writing.
[6073.03s -> 6073.43s]  This is it.
[6073.43s -> 6073.75s]  All right.
[6073.75s -> 6074.79s]  Advanced movie maker.
[6074.79s -> 6075.35s]  This is it.
[6075.35s -> 6075.85s]  Okay.
[6078.02s -> 6078.90s]  So sorry, Howard.
[6078.90s -> 6079.94s]  You're not happy about this.
[6080.50s -> 6082.02s]  So, you know, just stop doing it.
[6083.08s -> 6084.28s]  Just put this in the can.
[6086.30s -> 6088.06s]  Well, you're just going to do it anyway, so it don't matter.
[6089.96s -> 6090.68s]  All right, here we go.
[6093.08s -> 6095.64s]  Welcome to the advanced movie maker.
[6095.64s -> 6098.12s]  The powerful yet easy to use tool
[6098.12s -> 6101.40s]  that lets you create your very own movie masterpieces.
[6102.12s -> 6103.80s]  The longer your movie is,
[6103.80s -> 6106.76s]  the diversity and quality of its sets and scenes
[6106.76s -> 6110.60s]  and the more lead roles, extras, and costume changes it has,
[6110.60s -> 6111.64s]  the better it'll be.
[6112.36s -> 6115.00s]  However, the quality of your script writing facilities
[6115.00s -> 6116.44s]  in your studio lot
[6116.44s -> 6119.56s]  will determine the maximum possible quality of your movie.
[6123.46s -> 6124.50s]  All right, here we go.
[6124.50s -> 6126.14s]  Let me see if I remember how to do this.
[6137.93s -> 6139.93s]  Making an action movie, lead role.
[6139.93s -> 6143.46s]  We're going to have, let's have Leo.
[6144.18s -> 6148.89s]  Let's have Jax be supporting, just to see.
[6149.69s -> 6151.45s]  And then Adam Salem also supporting.
[6154.71s -> 6159.13s]  Leo as, this is all just to make sure
[6159.13s -> 6160.17s]  I remember how to do all this.
[6160.89s -> 6167.67s]  You can stay as Kurt.
[6167.67s -> 6168.23s]  That's fine.
[6168.23s -> 6169.19s]  And you can stay as Will.
[6170.68s -> 6171.24s]  Structure.
[6171.24s -> 6172.36s]  This is where we want it to be.
[6174.41s -> 6175.61s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6176.94s -> 6177.66s]  Detailed, right?
[6177.66s -> 6181.58s]  Freeform, trying to remember.
[6181.58s -> 6183.58s]  If it was, I think it's freeform.
[6183.58s -> 6188.01s]  It's been so fucking long.
[6189.86s -> 6190.58s]  Was it freeform?
[6190.58s -> 6192.10s]  Yeah, freeform that isn't based on the Hollywood.
[6192.10s -> 6192.66s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[6193.86s -> 6194.42s]  All right, here we go.
[6195.59s -> 6198.71s]  So we're going to start with,
[6200.26s -> 6203.38s]  yeah, you get to pick the different starting areas.
[6203.38s -> 6204.42s]  Let's just go to the bathroom.
[6207.93s -> 6209.37s]  Okay, this is where it begins.
[6220.12s -> 6221.64s]  Why are there zombies in here already?
[6222.28s -> 6226.76s]  Okay, so who's carrying who here?
[6229.30s -> 6230.90s]  Wait, why are you carrying him?
[6231.46s -> 6236.62s]  Oh, that's Jax.
[6236.62s -> 6237.10s]  That's okay.
[6238.70s -> 6239.58s]  He looks different.
[6240.38s -> 6241.98s]  Why are there people in here like this?
[6242.62s -> 6245.59s]  You don't even need to be in this bathroom.
[6245.59s -> 6250.79s]  Okay, so this is the, let's go in here.
[6250.79s -> 6251.83s]  Let me just see.
[6251.83s -> 6254.84s]  Preparation into the bath.
[6255.40s -> 6259.10s]  All right, let's just have you get in the bath.
[6259.66s -> 6264.52s]  This is, no, I'm not a porn director.
[6264.52s -> 6266.36s]  Okay, getting in the bath.
[6266.36s -> 6267.72s]  I want to put the camera.
[6267.72s -> 6270.50s]  We could have a change of camera.
[6270.50s -> 6271.38s]  Movie view, there we go.
[6271.94s -> 6279.43s]  All right, so that's Jax getting in the bath.
[6281.83s -> 6284.87s]  Down here we add scene, add a scene down here.
[6286.86s -> 6287.82s]  Same thing, bathroom.
[6289.10s -> 6290.70s]  Is there just like, just like taking a bath?
[6293.45s -> 6295.77s]  Let's see, like bath, just like taking bath.
[6295.77s -> 6296.73s]  Sad photo.
[6302.42s -> 6303.70s]  Wait, what is bath horror?
[6310.84s -> 6311.80s]  It's just already done.
[6324.58s -> 6325.46s]  Who's in the mirror?
[6325.46s -> 6326.66s]  There's nobody even in the mirror.
[6330.36s -> 6337.83s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[6337.83s -> 6339.11s]  So why, why can't,
[6340.23s -> 6345.70s]  has it got to be a better transitional piece here?
[6345.70s -> 6346.82s]  No, I want, let's, let's go with,
[6350.20s -> 6350.68s]  enter horror.
[6350.68s -> 6351.56s]  Let me see what we got here.
[6356.92s -> 6358.44s]  No, no, no, you're already in the bath.
[6358.44s -> 6359.40s]  This has to be somebody else.
[6368.33s -> 6370.89s]  Why would you have somebody smoking a cigarette in here?
[6371.69s -> 6374.17s]  All right, so he gets in the bath.
[6376.89s -> 6379.29s]  Just have like a bunch of angles of him getting into the bath.
[6379.29s -> 6382.44s]  All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6382.44s -> 6383.96s]  Yeah, yeah, okay, bath.
[6383.96s -> 6390.52s]  Let's go, bath.
[6392.49s -> 6394.49s]  Bath, enter, bath, massage.
[6394.49s -> 6398.14s]  Bath, drown.
[6398.14s -> 6400.38s]  They sneak in and just drown them?
[6400.38s -> 6409.21s]  Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6409.21s -> 6411.05s]  Wait, why are they, why would they be doing this?
[6416.49s -> 6417.77s]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[6423.13s -> 6424.33s]  This has to be different people.
[6426.98s -> 6427.70s]  You two come in.
[6428.42s -> 6429.70s]  Why are you in different clothes?
[6430.26s -> 6439.93s]  He's in a different, he's in different clothes.
[6444.74s -> 6446.18s]  Why the fuck is his hair white?
[6446.90s -> 6451.02s]  This is like the Joker.
[6459.14s -> 6462.18s]  Why does his hair turn gray?
[6462.18s -> 6463.78s]  Wait, who the fuck is this?
[6463.78s -> 6465.46s]  No, this is Adam Sandler in here.
[6465.46s -> 6466.98s]  Okay, well, that's what's going on.
[6474.79s -> 6475.75s]  Okay, that makes sense.
[6475.75s -> 6480.10s]  But then watch, why does his hair change color?
[6480.10s -> 6484.47s]  He comes in and then all of a sudden now he's, he has white hair.
[6488.18s -> 6493.75s]  Why did he age like 30 years?
[6493.75s -> 6494.55s]  Something, no, hold on.
[6494.55s -> 6501.19s]  Something ain't right here.
[6501.19s -> 6502.07s]  It's shampoo.
[6508.15s -> 6510.71s]  I didn't, I didn't set their costumes at the start.
[6510.71s -> 6511.27s]  Right, okay.
[6512.09s -> 6512.81s]  Well, it's all right.
[6512.81s -> 6515.29s]  We'll, we're learning again.
[6522.52s -> 6528.02s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6528.02s -> 6529.54s]  I need to add a couple of scenes here.
[6529.54s -> 6530.34s]  Let's go static.
[6535.48s -> 6536.60s]  There's nobody in the scene,
[6536.60s -> 6539.02s]  but we're going to put this over here.
[6540.49s -> 6541.93s]  Can I rearrange this?
[6543.78s -> 6544.42s]  I can, okay.
[6545.06s -> 6546.66s]  The static of the bathroom.
[6547.30s -> 6548.70s]  And he gets in.
[6552.71s -> 6553.67s]  No, no, no, he needs to get,
[6553.67s -> 6555.11s]  he needs to walk into the bathroom first.
[6555.11s -> 6555.75s]  That's important.
[6561.99s -> 6563.51s]  Here comes the soldiers.
[6563.51s -> 6564.71s]  Admire baby.
[6566.01s -> 6567.29s]  Applied perfume.
[6569.91s -> 6571.19s]  He's going to put perfume on
[6571.19s -> 6573.11s]  before he goes in the bath, apparently.
[6573.75s -> 6575.48s]  There's his hair again.
[6575.48s -> 6582.23s]  Put this back this way.
[6585.29s -> 6586.25s]  We need him coming in.
[6588.39s -> 6589.11s]  Enter cold.
[6595.91s -> 6598.23s]  All right, let's, I can't make this longer.
[6599.66s -> 6601.10s]  I don't want you to be here.
[6601.10s -> 6604.44s]  So we need to put, we need to put a dummy here, right?
[6606.25s -> 6606.89s]  Yeah.
[6606.89s -> 6618.70s]  Okay, so this is Jax coming in.
[6625.37s -> 6629.82s]  I'm flying perfume.
[6630.54s -> 6636.86s]  Drag the actor to the hanger.
[6638.07s -> 6638.63s]  Okay, right.
[6638.63s -> 6639.03s]  Here we go.
[6651.40s -> 6652.20s]  All right, is that,
[6652.20s -> 6653.56s]  will he be in this the whole time, I think?
[6657.98s -> 6661.02s]  Is he going to get in the bathtub with all his clothes on?
[6669.00s -> 6669.80s]  Okay, hold on.
[6676.44s -> 6678.04s]  Are they in the same space team?
[6688.36s -> 6690.34s]  No, you don't even need to be here.
[6690.34s -> 6692.65s]  No, this lady doesn't need to be here.
[6692.65s -> 6694.09s]  We've done our trial run.
[6694.09s -> 6697.16s]  All right, now we need to,
[6698.81s -> 6701.75s]  I need to have you.
[6701.75s -> 6707.34s]  There's got to be a reason why this happens.
[6707.34s -> 6709.34s]  Bath horror, bath shock.
[6709.34s -> 6713.02s]  Someone is shocked by someone, something nasty in the bath.
[6713.02s -> 6722.97s]  Oh, it's, he's shocked by him in the bath.
[6722.97s -> 6729.72s]  All right, I want to put this down.
[6729.72s -> 6732.66s]  How do I move the camera down and up?
[6732.66s -> 6734.18s]  I forget what the controls are for this.
[6734.74s -> 6737.66s]  Because I want to put the camera in a different spot.
[6738.30s -> 6749.64s]  What is it?
[6749.64s -> 6751.93s]  Alt, arrow keys.
[6751.93s -> 6754.89s]  I think it's like shift and, shift and arrow keys.
[6755.53s -> 6756.41s]  Alt and the arrow keys.
[6759.48s -> 6760.52s]  Shift and scroll.
[6760.52s -> 6761.96s]  I know it's something, some combination.
[6762.60s -> 6768.12s]  It's not middle mouse, W A S D.
[6768.12s -> 6769.96s]  No, it's come on, get down there.
[6772.47s -> 6776.34s]  Control, page up, page down.
[6777.42s -> 6777.82s]  Damn it.
[6779.26s -> 6779.50s]  Shit.
[6780.79s -> 6781.35s]  Well, it's all right.
[6781.35s -> 6782.63s]  I'll figure it out later.
[6782.63s -> 6784.23s]  So this needs to be over here.
[6787.38s -> 6789.30s]  And then have him get in the bath.
[6789.86s -> 6791.24s]  Plus and minus.
[6793.03s -> 6795.14s]  So he comes in, cold.
[6796.23s -> 6796.87s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6796.87s -> 6797.91s]  This is going to be over here.
[6803.32s -> 6805.24s]  It's all plus shift plus tab.
[6805.88s -> 6806.36s]  Wait, what?
[6808.47s -> 6812.25s]  And then he gets into the bath.
[6812.25s -> 6815.35s]  So enter bath.
[6815.99s -> 6825.66s]  Bath massage, bath horror, bath enter.
[6826.22s -> 6827.58s]  Now he's going to get in.
[6827.58s -> 6843.37s]  But I want the free-form cameras to show him like,
[6843.37s -> 6843.85s]  okay, hold on.
[6843.85s -> 6849.77s]  Like I need to be able to fucking move this camera.
[6849.77s -> 6859.78s]  All right.
[6859.78s -> 6863.54s]  What about here?
[6863.54s -> 6864.90s]  Toggle empty parts on.
[6868.73s -> 6869.69s]  And then he drowns.
[6870.41s -> 6874.84s]  He then he drowns him.
[6874.84s -> 6875.16s]  All right.
[6875.16s -> 6876.60s]  Let me, let me, give me this.
[6876.60s -> 6877.00s]  Okay.
[6877.00s -> 6881.34s]  I think, let's just see how this looks.
[6881.90s -> 6885.72s]  Now we got to add music and sounds and shit.
[6886.20s -> 6889.61s]  Is it the number pad?
[6889.61s -> 6890.84s]  No, too bad.
[6892.42s -> 6892.74s]  All right.
[6898.10s -> 6902.63s]  So now let me just make sure that there's nothing else I want to really do.
[6902.63s -> 6903.91s]  Just to test this movie.
[6904.55s -> 6911.10s]  So now we have to have him like run away.
[6917.16s -> 6918.36s]  Should we just carry him out?
[6921.69s -> 6922.65s]  Walk with axe.
[6923.29s -> 6924.49s]  Carry box.
[6924.49s -> 6924.89s]  Jolt?
[6925.69s -> 6927.61s]  Wait, an explosion.
[6938.14s -> 6938.78s]  Intensity.
[6940.10s -> 6941.54s]  Moderate duration short.
[6949.13s -> 6950.49s]  No, I don't, I don't want that.
[6950.49s -> 6951.13s]  I don't like it.
[6951.85s -> 6953.21s]  We're going to delete it.
[6953.21s -> 6964.23s]  How about investigation?
[6964.23s -> 6964.55s]  Prop.
[6965.67s -> 6966.71s]  Bashing objects.
[6970.73s -> 6971.61s]  Pick up weapon.
[6971.61s -> 6972.09s]  Traveling.
[6972.09s -> 6973.21s]  No, just, just exit.
[6975.50s -> 6976.14s]  Violence.
[6980.17s -> 6981.29s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6981.29s -> 6985.85s]  Let's do, what do we have for violence?
[6987.46s -> 6987.70s]  Fight.
[6988.34s -> 6989.54s]  Brandish blade.
[6989.54s -> 6990.34s]  Confrontation.
[6990.34s -> 6991.46s]  Dead body.
[6991.46s -> 6995.29s]  There's the scream spin.
[6995.85s -> 6997.05s]  Death in arms.
[6997.69s -> 7001.32s]  But he drowns him and then he dies in his arm?
[7013.21s -> 7019.10s]  Okay, what?
[7021.26s -> 7022.54s]  How, when does he die?
[7022.54s -> 7024.06s]  How long does it take for him to die?
[7024.06s -> 7025.74s]  Someone's just brushing their teeth.
[7026.38s -> 7028.79s]  Someone comes in and just starts brushing their teeth.
[7029.59s -> 7030.55s]  Not kissing.
[7030.55s -> 7032.14s]  Um, panic.
[7053.86s -> 7055.30s]  It's taking a very long time.
[7055.30s -> 7057.46s]  Is it, can I change the duration?
[7058.18s -> 7064.84s]  And then he drowns him again.
[7076.02s -> 7077.78s]  No, no, no, no.
[7077.78s -> 7078.66s]  Not opposites.
[7080.30s -> 7084.38s]  You need to be, you need to pick him up and put him down in the bath and then drown him again.
[7091.67s -> 7094.31s]  This time, this, this time his hair is normal.
[7096.22s -> 7097.02s]  I hate this.
[7097.66s -> 7104.28s]  I need to like have it cut like here.
[7105.32s -> 7113.42s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7113.42s -> 7113.90s]  Not here.
[7113.90s -> 7116.30s]  I need to have him pick him up, put him down, like put him down
[7116.30s -> 7117.58s]  and have the edit beat right here.
[7122.95s -> 7129.13s]  Okay, that looks good to me.
[7130.60s -> 7131.64s]  Yeah, you do that in post.
[7131.64s -> 7131.88s]  Yep.
[7132.68s -> 7134.28s]  All right, so then, so he needs to pick him up.
[7140.47s -> 7141.27s]  Pick up weapon.
[7141.27s -> 7142.87s]  No, pick up or carry.
[7145.91s -> 7146.71s]  Carry person.
[7147.27s -> 7158.06s]  I don't know why there's so many random zombies.
[7158.06s -> 7158.62s]  Location.
[7159.26s -> 7162.14s]  Uh, we're going to go rescued, angry, dead.
[7162.14s -> 7162.46s]  Okay.
[7163.58s -> 7172.18s]  And then I need to put down.
[7172.18s -> 7173.30s]  So this needs to be over here.
[7173.86s -> 7176.70s]  He cries and then, is there a pick up?
[7180.68s -> 7182.04s]  Just have a zombie here?
[7182.04s -> 7184.04s]  No, that's not, that's not going to make any sense.
[7185.16s -> 7189.82s]  Uh, I need a, I need like a pick up.
[7191.30s -> 7192.10s]  Is there a pick?
[7192.10s -> 7192.66s]  I'm going to sneeze.
[7198.98s -> 7200.02s]  Investigate.
[7200.02s -> 7200.90s]  Close book.
[7200.90s -> 7201.14s]  No.
[7201.78s -> 7203.22s]  Someone is shocked by something.
[7203.22s -> 7204.02s]  Oh, no.
[7207.05s -> 7208.17s]  Read open book.
[7208.17s -> 7209.53s]  Take photo.
[7209.53s -> 7217.86s]  A group of people gather around a dead body.
[7217.86s -> 7218.74s]  Find corpse.
[7221.58s -> 7222.70s]  Prop focus.
[7222.70s -> 7223.66s]  Gun sneak by.
[7225.29s -> 7226.09s]  Murder scene.
[7226.09s -> 7226.33s]  No.
[7227.90s -> 7229.26s]  Is he reading on the toilet?
[7231.80s -> 7232.52s]  All right, pacing.
[7232.52s -> 7235.16s]  We need pacing because he can't, he doesn't know what to do.
[7235.16s -> 7236.52s]  So he's going to pick him up and drown him again.
[7239.43s -> 7240.47s]  Duration medium.
[7244.01s -> 7245.21s]  He's a little too happy though.
[7248.52s -> 7250.20s]  I wonder what's the solution here.
[7259.10s -> 7259.34s]  All right.
[7259.34s -> 7260.06s]  Put that here.
[7265.42s -> 7265.90s]  Drown.
[7265.90s -> 7266.22s]  Okay.
[7266.22s -> 7266.94s]  Then he's dead.
[7267.66s -> 7268.94s]  Doesn't know what to do.
[7268.94s -> 7269.58s]  Picks him up.
[7269.58s -> 7270.78s]  Puts him back in the bathtub.
[7270.78s -> 7272.06s]  I need a pick up body.
[7276.74s -> 7277.30s]  Enter.
[7277.30s -> 7277.94s]  Horror.
[7277.94s -> 7278.42s]  Exit.
[7278.42s -> 7278.82s]  Carry.
[7280.30s -> 7280.78s]  Enter.
[7280.78s -> 7281.26s]  Carry.
[7285.30s -> 7290.70s]  Pick up weapon.
[7296.63s -> 7297.35s]  Examine.
[7297.35s -> 7298.71s]  Examine would probably be fine.
[7298.71s -> 7299.19s]  That's right.
[7299.83s -> 7300.87s]  Examine body.
[7301.83s -> 7303.96s]  Let's just see what it looks like.
[7309.35s -> 7310.55s]  Different, wrong people, but.
[7311.51s -> 7312.39s]  Look, you cut it right here.
[7313.35s -> 7315.02s]  Okay, this one's good.
[7315.66s -> 7321.24s]  We could trim it so he ends up picking him up.
[7321.24s -> 7322.44s]  You know, it goes down like this.
[7324.17s -> 7325.53s]  And then we cut to him walking.
[7326.25s -> 7335.27s]  Checking his pulse.
[7335.27s -> 7336.15s]  Reaction to body.
[7336.15s -> 7336.71s]  Angry.
[7336.71s -> 7337.43s]  Sad.
[7337.43s -> 7337.67s]  Laugh.
[7351.62s -> 7352.42s]  Why is he going?
[7370.33s -> 7371.29s]  No, no, no.
[7371.29s -> 7371.85s]  I hate it.
[7373.67s -> 7374.55s]  That's no.
[7375.19s -> 7377.21s]  We're going to do sad.
[7380.86s -> 7381.58s]  Sad works.
[7383.05s -> 7385.29s]  So that is over here.
[7385.29s -> 7387.56s]  So then he picks him up.
[7388.12s -> 7390.31s]  All right.
[7390.95s -> 7392.06s]  Drowns him again.
[7393.42s -> 7394.70s]  And then runs out.
[7398.70s -> 7400.62s]  I don't know why I just did war bombed street.
[7407.64s -> 7408.84s]  Sniper search.
[7417.91s -> 7418.95s]  Sniper duel.
[7418.95s -> 7421.46s]  We can do that later.
[7421.46s -> 7422.18s]  No, this is good.
[7422.18s -> 7422.66s]  This is good.
[7422.66s -> 7422.98s]  This is good.
[7422.98s -> 7423.78s]  This is done.
[7423.78s -> 7426.10s]  I can edit it.
[7426.10s -> 7428.98s]  I just want to, I just, we're just doing a little one just to try.
[7428.98s -> 7433.46s]  Get out of town.
[7434.84s -> 7436.04s]  It's just a default name.
[7438.18s -> 7438.90s]  Okay.
[7438.90s -> 7448.07s]  Now I bring this over to, what do I bring this now?
[7448.07s -> 7448.79s]  Over to casting.
[7454.17s -> 7454.97s]  And then they shoot it.
[7455.53s -> 7458.58s]  But isn't it, it's not already cast?
[7459.30s -> 7464.90s]  I thought I already did that in the advanced section.
[7464.90s -> 7465.14s]  No?
[7465.78s -> 7469.46s]  Yeah, it is cast.
[7469.46s -> 7470.66s]  So what's, I don't understand.
[7473.18s -> 7474.30s]  You have to do that, I guess.
[7475.26s -> 7475.74s]  Let me see.
[7478.09s -> 7478.41s]  All right.
[7478.41s -> 7479.05s]  No, it is.
[7479.05s -> 7480.49s]  So we just need some extras.
[7480.49s -> 7481.61s]  Who is the, what do you mean extras?
[7491.16s -> 7492.68s]  Who are the, who's an extra in this?
[7493.24s -> 7497.08s]  Why would there be an extra?
[7497.08s -> 7508.28s]  How do I get an extra in here?
[7508.28s -> 7509.32s]  I don't know who this is.
[7514.46s -> 7515.26s]  Writers needed.
[7515.26s -> 7516.86s]  There's no one writing the script.
[7520.42s -> 7524.02s]  Shoot it.
[7524.02s -> 7524.26s]  Okay.
[7524.26s -> 7524.98s]  This should be done.
[7528.55s -> 7529.83s]  I have instant movie making, right?
[7538.42s -> 7538.82s]  All right.
[7538.82s -> 7545.72s]  So now I take this into, what do I take this into?
[7546.44s -> 7550.57s]  I take it into like the advanced movie maker, right?
[7551.13s -> 7555.19s]  I think, actually, I don't think I have it.
[7555.83s -> 7558.25s]  Post-production.
[7558.89s -> 7562.84s]  Do I not have one of these?
[7562.84s -> 7563.32s]  I thought I did.
[7566.17s -> 7566.49s]  Okay.
[7574.87s -> 7575.83s]  Post-production.
[7575.83s -> 7576.55s]  Here we go.
[7576.55s -> 7582.17s]  Welcome to post-production where you can edit and enhance your movies in a variety of ways.
[7582.17s -> 7587.69s]  You can also export your movies as files that you can then send to your friends or post online.
[7589.32s -> 7589.88s]  It's time.
[7590.52s -> 7592.20s]  It's time to make the doughnuts.
[7593.27s -> 7598.57s]  So let's open up the, the art of war is the song.
[7605.19s -> 7607.35s]  No, it ain't going to be the art of war.
[7607.35s -> 7611.74s]  How do I remove that?
[7611.74s -> 7612.30s]  Just delete it.
[7612.94s -> 7613.54s]  All right.
[7613.54s -> 7614.82s]  Let's get a song here.
[7614.82s -> 7616.26s]  No, I'm not going to do acid bass.
[7616.98s -> 7623.67s]  How's this one?
[7623.67s -> 7636.50s]  How about Armageddon?
[7637.30s -> 7638.50s]  Advancing Army.
[7639.86s -> 7640.74s]  How's about that?
[7641.30s -> 7643.99s]  That's essentially the same title as the movie.
[7648.14s -> 7653.83s]  I don't, I like it.
[7653.83s -> 7655.19s]  Let's put the volume down a little bit.
[7655.91s -> 7658.23s]  Uh, I want something, I want a better title in here.
[7658.87s -> 7663.19s]  I'm going to add a title because I don't like this one.
[7663.83s -> 7666.14s]  Now, Lionhead movies.
[7666.14s -> 7666.70s]  No, no, no.
[7668.07s -> 7669.43s]  How do we get out of this title?
[7669.99s -> 7676.33s]  I think we can add it later.
[7676.33s -> 7677.61s]  Maybe ABC.
[7678.41s -> 7679.03s]  Oh yeah.
[7679.03s -> 7680.63s]  I can record voiceover on this too.
[7685.19s -> 7685.75s]  Let's see here.
[7686.39s -> 7694.38s]  So this starts out like this static.
[7694.94s -> 7696.46s]  Hold on.
[7696.46s -> 7699.10s]  It's because he comes in with them.
[7699.10s -> 7701.98s]  I didn't, I, is this the extra?
[7705.51s -> 7707.03s]  It's so fast.
[7708.31s -> 7708.63s]  Okay.
[7714.79s -> 7715.19s]  Okay.
[7715.19s -> 7715.51s]  All right.
[7715.51s -> 7716.23s]  All right.
[7716.23s -> 7718.23s]  Now we know where the extra is and I can't remove them.
[7718.23s -> 7719.11s]  It's already been filmed.
[7725.98s -> 7726.46s]  Okay.
[7726.46s -> 7727.98s]  So we need some sound here.
[7728.62s -> 7733.38s]  We need like a, okay.
[7733.38s -> 7734.26s]  How about right here?
[7735.54s -> 7744.73s]  Let's have bed squeak door, open door, metal, bang, metal, freak, whistle.
[7744.73s -> 7745.29s]  Police.
[7745.29s -> 7746.41s]  What is whistle police?
[7755.45s -> 7755.69s]  No.
[7759.46s -> 7764.06s]  Human sounds.
[7764.06s -> 7765.82s]  It has to be like, mm hmm.
[7767.69s -> 7786.41s]  I'll have a cough and then he gets in.
[7786.41s -> 7787.21s]  He gets in the bath.
[7787.93s -> 7795.11s]  He comes in way too fast.
[7795.11s -> 7795.51s]  Okay.
[7795.51s -> 7805.83s]  Now we need, we need like a, we need like a, oh, it's hot.
[7810.20s -> 7810.68s]  Scream.
[7811.56s -> 7814.92s]  Is there a way you can hear them?
[7814.92s -> 7815.64s]  I thought there was.
[7816.44s -> 7817.64s]  Why don't I just make the noise?
[7824.55s -> 7824.87s]  Okay.
[7824.87s -> 7828.34s]  So it's too hot.
[7829.51s -> 7829.75s]  All right.
[7829.75s -> 7831.03s]  We need, we need a scream here.
[7831.83s -> 7846.18s]  So like right here.
[7849.78s -> 7850.18s]  It's good.
[7850.18s -> 7864.65s]  And then we need like an, ah, this is probably fine.
[7871.22s -> 7873.45s]  That's not what I thought it was going to be.
[7873.45s -> 7875.13s]  It's just one grunt.
[7886.25s -> 7887.53s]  It's because the camera.
[7887.53s -> 7894.65s]  I wanted to have to, is it, can I not?
[7894.65s -> 7896.33s]  How do I make the camera stay?
[7897.78s -> 7899.06s]  That's very important.
[7904.33s -> 7906.01s]  He's going to scream a couple of times too.
[7911.11s -> 7912.55s]  Not a porn game.
[7912.55s -> 7919.69s]  All right.
[7919.69s -> 7924.78s]  Hold on.
[7924.78s -> 7925.66s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7925.66s -> 7929.80s]  It's going to be like a pluzz.
[7929.80s -> 7930.52s]  No belch.
[7930.52s -> 7931.24s]  No cough.
[7932.04s -> 7935.16s]  He does kind of like cough a little, like right here.
[7935.16s -> 7936.12s]  He turns over.
[7936.12s -> 7937.08s]  He turns his head over.
[7945.26s -> 7957.27s]  We need, ah, scream.
[7958.23s -> 7960.82s]  One, scream.
[7961.38s -> 7966.95s]  Two, sniff.
[7987.13s -> 7989.06s]  Okay.
[7989.06s -> 7991.16s]  Big slurp.
[7992.39s -> 7993.19s]  This looks good.
[7993.99s -> 8005.88s]  And then we need like, ah, breathe heavy.
[8024.42s -> 8035.66s]  This goes on so long.
[8038.22s -> 8043.22s]  He's, he's, he's smelling his hands.
[8051.78s -> 8053.30s]  That's so stupid.
[8053.30s -> 8053.78s]  There you go.
[8063.22s -> 8064.58s]  It's the purview.
[8066.66s -> 8077.59s]  I can't put a fart sound in here.
[8077.59s -> 8078.79s]  That's so easy.
[8080.12s -> 8081.40s]  We need to have like coughing.
[8110.54s -> 8111.58s]  He's like swallowing.
[8111.58s -> 8112.62s]  This is so awful.
[8112.62s -> 8115.74s]  He's swallowing so much water that he's just like.
[8117.98s -> 8119.18s]  These aren't even burps.
[8120.68s -> 8144.46s]  This is fucking horrible.
[8148.17s -> 8149.37s]  No, we need more coughs.
[8149.37s -> 8150.33s]  This burp sucks.
[8168.95s -> 8208.15s]  I'm only going to put this in temporarily because people are demanding it.
[8208.15s -> 8210.86s]  No, no, no, it's not.
[8210.86s -> 8212.22s]  It's so stupid.
[8213.29s -> 8214.41s]  I don't know if I can have it.
[8229.00s -> 8231.00s]  You guys realize I have to do this again.
[8231.72s -> 8232.92s]  This happens another time.
[8249.00s -> 8249.72s]  Fuck this.
[8251.16s -> 8252.04s]  The little shake.
[8253.16s -> 8254.28s]  It's like right here.
[8275.61s -> 8278.73s]  No, but if he smells here, then I.
[8282.12s -> 8284.68s]  No, this changes everything.
[8296.74s -> 8298.90s]  No, it can't be like this.
[8298.90s -> 8339.14s]  Come on, don't start lagging on me now.
[8359.82s -> 8361.34s]  Back here, back here, back here.
[8361.34s -> 8373.46s]  It's going to be more frequent.
[8388.74s -> 8391.14s]  It's supposed to be smelling the perfume and not the.
[8392.34s -> 8396.65s]  Does it kind of copy these?
[8396.65s -> 8397.61s]  Is there a way I can just copy?
[8411.77s -> 8412.57s]  I hate that.
[8413.21s -> 8425.72s]  This is fucked up.
[8425.72s -> 8443.91s]  This is this is like getting borderline not safe for work.
[8444.55s -> 8452.39s]  All right.
[8452.39s -> 8454.07s]  Then what happens is he picks up.
[8454.07s -> 8463.61s]  Okay, right here.
[8463.61s -> 8464.89s]  I mean, he dies.
[8468.30s -> 8469.50s]  I don't even need the scene.
[8469.50s -> 8470.86s]  This whole scene doesn't even need to exist.
[8475.56s -> 8493.78s]  And this whole scene doesn't need to exist because I want to cut this portion.
[8493.78s -> 8494.50s]  How do I do that?
[8495.98s -> 8496.94s]  Is there like a scissor?
[8496.94s -> 8497.34s]  There it is.
[8498.38s -> 8499.66s]  Audio options.
[8499.66s -> 8500.46s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[8501.18s -> 8502.22s]  Here it is.
[8502.22s -> 8510.04s]  Split scene because I wanted to pick them up like here.
[8513.66s -> 8515.10s]  Right at the edge there.
[8517.96s -> 8518.68s]  Like right there.
[8522.12s -> 8524.57s]  Like right here.
[8524.57s -> 8527.80s]  We can get rid of these.
[8533.98s -> 8539.77s]  Okay, now I should be able to drag this into here.
[8541.61s -> 8541.93s]  Yes.
[8542.89s -> 8543.75s]  Delete this.
[8547.99s -> 8548.23s]  Yes.
[8549.27s -> 8552.07s]  And that's him picked now.
[8552.07s -> 8554.07s]  He lifts his head up.
[8554.07s -> 8560.22s]  Let's put the scene here.
[8560.86s -> 8578.81s]  And then he needs to put him back down.
[8582.06s -> 8583.85s]  And then down.
[8586.31s -> 8588.98s]  So right here.
[8589.85s -> 8590.33s]  Right here.
[8604.44s -> 8605.88s]  Why is he out of the tub though?
[8610.55s -> 8612.55s]  This whole scene, I'm getting rid of this one.
[8612.55s -> 8613.91s]  It doesn't even need to be here.
[8613.91s -> 8621.77s]  We're changing the music too.
[8625.82s -> 8626.32s]  What?
[8631.85s -> 8632.89s]  Oh, it's because...
[8632.89s -> 8633.77s]  Oh, shit.
[8633.77s -> 8636.66s]  The timeline changed.
[8637.93s -> 8638.41s]  How do I...
[8638.41s -> 8639.45s]  Can I put them all together?
[8641.86s -> 8644.14s]  Why did that happen?
[8644.14s -> 8645.02s]  I didn't move these.
[8645.58s -> 8650.06s]  The timeline changed down here because I edited...
[8650.06s -> 8651.90s]  Okay, you gotta edit that shit up top first.
[8654.73s -> 8655.37s]  That's all right.
[8655.37s -> 8656.17s]  I can just move it forward.
[8656.89s -> 8657.69s]  This is the cough room.
[8659.61s -> 8671.86s]  Just move everything forward.
[8671.86s -> 8673.30s]  That cough is right here.
[8677.62s -> 8684.73s]  A little bit more.
[8684.73s -> 8685.93s]  And then he gets in the bathtub.
[8698.31s -> 8701.46s]  Right there.
[8702.26s -> 8703.77s]  All right, that's a good spot.
[8712.22s -> 8712.94s]  Who's crying?
[8715.10s -> 8718.47s]  Why is somebody crying?
[8723.45s -> 8724.73s]  Oh, he cries.
[8724.73s -> 8725.21s]  He does.
[8727.82s -> 8728.30s]  It's him.
[8733.67s -> 8734.71s]  He cries like right here.
[8747.78s -> 8749.38s]  This music is gonna drive me fucking crazy.
[8785.27s -> 8791.90s]  It's not even funny.
[8792.86s -> 8794.78s]  I don't know why I laugh at it every time.
[8794.78s -> 8795.90s]  It's not even funny.
[8805.29s -> 8821.34s]  All right, we need a little bit more.
[8822.84s -> 8823.88s]  We need music to...
[8823.88s -> 8824.92s]  The music's changed right here.
[8829.18s -> 8830.82s]  What was that?
[8830.82s -> 8831.54s]  Did you hear that?
[8834.66s -> 8835.30s]  What was that?
[8837.54s -> 8843.10s]  There's like 20 people screaming.
[8853.74s -> 8860.97s]  Music changes.
[8875.53s -> 8891.90s]  And right now.
[8896.70s -> 8909.74s]  Okay, here's...
[8912.66s -> 8915.74s]  This one needs to be changed,
[8915.74s -> 8917.26s]  and then this one changes too like that.
[8920.14s -> 8935.42s]  Right here.
[8935.42s -> 8937.18s]  All right, we gotta add a couple more screams.
[8939.85s -> 8942.57s]  This is the only fart that's gonna be in the entire stream, by the way.
[8942.57s -> 8953.90s]  There's not gonna be any more farts.
[8953.90s -> 8955.58s]  I can promise you that.
[8955.58s -> 8967.13s]  Okay, I need a couple more coughs.
[8974.39s -> 9007.96s]  I fucking want to remove it so bad.
[9015.75s -> 9031.67s]  I need one more cough.
[9031.67s -> 9032.95s]  What does slurp sound like?
[9037.37s -> 9038.57s]  No, that's not gonna work.
[9040.26s -> 9040.90s]  Get rid of this.
[9046.62s -> 9047.42s]  Bullet?
[9051.38s -> 9052.42s]  Call of Duty hit sound.
[9052.42s -> 9059.83s]  Okay, all right.
[9059.83s -> 9061.03s]  Last, I need a cough.
[9061.03s -> 9061.75s]  One more cough.
[9068.15s -> 9068.87s]  Like right here.
[9073.91s -> 9078.22s]  Do a bubble noise after the fart.
[9078.78s -> 9079.90s]  Oh my god.
[9090.22s -> 9092.70s]  What if we just dropped a fucking huge dump in here?
[9109.86s -> 9110.90s]  Splash bath?
[9117.46s -> 9119.62s]  Okay, we need to get...
[9119.62s -> 9121.30s]  The song has to start playing again.
[9129.03s -> 9134.66s]  I think actually...
[9134.66s -> 9135.38s]  No, hold on.
[9180.55s -> 9181.43s]  No, I'm sorry, guys.
[9181.43s -> 9182.79s]  This is not gonna be like a dump.
[9183.59s -> 9185.03s]  That's like TOS.
[9185.03s -> 9186.31s]  I'm not gonna get like dumped.
[9230.79s -> 9237.16s]  All right, I need to cut this track here.
[9237.72s -> 9241.19s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9241.19s -> 9242.15s]  Undo, undo, undo.
[9242.15s -> 9243.43s]  That's not what I wanted to do.
[9243.43s -> 9246.07s]  Is there an undo button?
[9246.07s -> 9250.02s]  I think there is.
[9250.58s -> 9253.11s]  Where is it?
[9253.11s -> 9255.98s]  Control Z?
[9255.98s -> 9258.15s]  Will the bullet work?
[9258.15s -> 9261.72s]  No, there is no undo.
[9261.72s -> 9264.44s]  Gotta be aware that there is no undo.
[9264.44s -> 9271.80s]  So how do I make this smaller?
[9271.80s -> 9274.31s]  How do I get rid of that?
[9274.31s -> 9287.21s]  Toggle mumbly that they can like be mumbling.
[9287.29s -> 9288.49s]  Top left, that's exit.
[9289.13s -> 9293.10s]  Do you want to click the exit button
[9293.10s -> 9296.38s]  and waste the last like 45 minutes in this dumb movie?
[9301.54s -> 9303.54s]  I think I can do no sound, right?
[9303.54s -> 9305.78s]  Wasn't there a track that's like no, like kill the audio?
[9306.42s -> 9309.08s]  I think there is one.
[9311.75s -> 9312.55s]  Isn't there like a hundred?
[9312.55s -> 9313.35s]  How do I get rid of that?
[9319.21s -> 9320.01s]  Because I can't...
[9322.31s -> 9329.27s]  Yeah, I can't like drag, like click and drag.
[9329.91s -> 9332.34s]  This has got to be something, right?
[9333.06s -> 9336.34s]  I don't think so.
[9336.98s -> 9343.61s]  I can adjust the volume on the whole, on the master.
[9344.25s -> 9348.26s]  Yeah, right click doesn't do anything.
[9348.26s -> 9350.18s]  The scissor just cuts, but hold on.
[9354.49s -> 9362.17s]  No, no, no.
[9362.17s -> 9364.17s]  Just cut the clip and remove the end part.
[9364.17s -> 9366.01s]  Yeah, that's what I was trying to do, but I can't...
[9369.05s -> 9373.11s]  I can't cut the clip for some reason.
[9373.11s -> 9376.39s]  When I click here, it cuts the video track.
[9376.95s -> 9380.30s]  That's what I thought, right?
[9380.30s -> 9382.62s]  Split scene, just splitting the scene.
[9385.93s -> 9393.59s]  It's all right.
[9393.59s -> 9395.11s]  There should be more than one audio channel.
[9395.11s -> 9398.63s]  Yeah, it's not as advanced as you might think.
[9400.25s -> 9401.45s]  Save the game, save the game.
[9401.61s -> 9402.25s]  I will, I will.
[9402.97s -> 9403.85s]  We're good, but I...
[9403.85s -> 9404.57s]  Hold on, hold on.
[9409.98s -> 9410.86s]  This is this...
[9410.86s -> 9412.38s]  Fine, it doesn't matter.
[9412.38s -> 9413.18s]  All right, we got it.
[9417.37s -> 9417.85s]  It's all right.
[9417.85s -> 9419.85s]  We could just have the music played over again.
[9420.49s -> 9425.83s]  And so then, I'm not doing all that again.
[9425.83s -> 9427.35s]  I'm just going to do some coughs.
[9427.35s -> 9428.63s]  We got to export this shit.
[9438.01s -> 9438.89s]  Wait, what happened to the...
[9438.89s -> 9439.61s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9439.61s -> 9441.61s]  What happened to the video files that were back here?
[9442.84s -> 9443.32s]  What happened?
[9460.54s -> 9461.58s]  Oh, okay, okay.
[9461.58s -> 9463.26s]  First, I'm all the way back here now.
[9463.26s -> 9472.63s]  All right, here we go.
[9473.19s -> 9476.63s]  I wish I could just copy all these and put them over here, but I can't.
[9476.63s -> 9477.91s]  So here's what we're going to do.
[9477.91s -> 9483.96s]  Let's have him...
[9483.96s -> 9484.44s]  Let's see.
[9506.62s -> 9507.66s]  Now I'm yawning.
[9507.66s -> 9508.70s]  No, I'm going to yawn too.
[9512.25s -> 9513.13s]  How is that a yawn?
[9513.69s -> 9514.17s]  That's enough.
[9514.17s -> 9515.29s]  That's a yawn, apparently.
[9538.76s -> 9543.29s]  That don't fit.
[9571.66s -> 9572.54s]  Here we go again.
[9573.34s -> 9574.30s]  Here we go again.
[9574.30s -> 9574.62s]  Okay.
[9587.96s -> 9590.07s]  Where is it?
[9590.07s -> 9590.87s]  Belch.
[9590.87s -> 9633.43s]  Okay.
[9633.43s -> 9650.26s]  Comedy music for the drowning.
[9662.70s -> 9662.94s]  It's...
[9668.90s -> 9673.88s]  Every movie I make in this has the same repeat the scene thing.
[9697.88s -> 9699.08s]  Breaking his neck.
[9702.65s -> 9703.69s]  Oh, God.
[9736.97s -> 9738.65s]  Oh, my God.
[9738.65s -> 9754.01s]  Okay.
[9754.01s -> 9757.50s]  Should I change my stream to like 18 and over?
[9770.41s -> 9771.61s]  Well, now I need to.
[9774.58s -> 9775.30s]  All right, let me get...
[9776.10s -> 9776.82s]  Hold on.
[9776.82s -> 9791.59s]  Beauty like no other leads into...
[9792.31s -> 9793.19s]  Get this out of here.
[9809.70s -> 9809.94s]  All right.
[9809.94s -> 9812.42s]  I'm actually going to remove this because we don't need it anymore.
[9813.48s -> 9816.84s]  No!
[9816.84s -> 9818.44s]  The timeline does that thing.
[9823.42s -> 9823.98s]  Shit.
[9823.98s -> 9825.34s]  Why does it do that?
[9825.34s -> 9830.94s]  Oh, that sucks.
[9830.94s -> 9832.78s]  That whole thing gets ruined down here.
[9832.78s -> 9833.74s]  I don't remember that happening.
[9836.01s -> 9836.89s]  There is no undo.
[9842.33s -> 9843.45s]  That has to be an undo.
[9848.60s -> 9848.92s]  Right?
[9848.92s -> 9850.04s]  Like that has to be.
[9850.04s -> 9857.13s]  Oh, it controls.
[9857.13s -> 9857.93s]  He doesn't do anything.
[9865.34s -> 9865.90s]  Shit.
[9865.90s -> 9866.70s]  Really?
[9866.70s -> 9868.06s]  That sucks that it does that.
[9869.10s -> 9876.94s]  I'm not going to click the exit button.
[9877.58s -> 9879.74s]  I got to like burn that into my brain
[9879.74s -> 9881.42s]  that if you change anything up here,
[9881.42s -> 9885.21s]  it shrinks the whole every single timeline.
[9885.21s -> 9887.13s]  You can map an undo key.
[9887.13s -> 9891.11s]  Delete.
[9891.85s -> 9892.89s]  Thumbnail.
[9892.89s -> 9893.29s]  Split.
[9893.29s -> 9894.33s]  Like why are these grayed out?
[9894.89s -> 9896.20s]  What is this?
[9897.16s -> 9897.56s]  Fade out.
[9897.56s -> 9898.68s]  Oh, fade out and fade in.
[9899.24s -> 9902.58s]  That sucks.
[9902.58s -> 9911.03s]  I haven't unlocked the undo.
[9912.31s -> 9914.10s]  Well, hold on.
[9915.90s -> 9917.02s]  And that's the end of the movie.
[9918.14s -> 9922.14s]  Watch the undo tutorial.
[9922.14s -> 9924.52s]  I wonder.
[9925.08s -> 9929.14s]  Deleting scenes, cutting scenes, moving scenes.
[9930.90s -> 9932.10s]  No, I don't think that's going to do it.
[9935.54s -> 9937.70s]  Yeah, what I'm going to have to burn into my memory
[9937.70s -> 9939.46s]  is trim everything, get everything the way
[9939.46s -> 9941.86s]  that I want it first completely
[9941.86s -> 9942.90s]  and then do sound effects.
[9942.90s -> 9946.02s]  So I'm going to have to go for it here.
[9946.02s -> 9948.18s]  Just have to move everything like an inch forward.
[9955.46s -> 9956.18s]  And then that's it.
[9968.25s -> 9969.13s]  What a pain in the ass.
[9972.94s -> 9974.78s]  I wish they would remake this game
[9974.78s -> 9977.98s]  and put all the quality of life features that it deserves.
[9986.95s -> 9991.24s]  Can I move the whole timeline?
[9991.24s -> 9992.36s]  I don't think so.
[9992.36s -> 9994.60s]  No, when you click in the timeline,
[9994.60s -> 9996.12s]  you just add a sound.
[9998.26s -> 10000.50s]  Yeah, save every before you do everything.
[10001.46s -> 10003.45s]  It is a learning process.
[10005.77s -> 10008.87s]  Yeah, the whole thing just has to go forward again.
[10025.85s -> 10029.62s]  Check you have control in the undo.
[10029.62s -> 10030.98s]  I'm scared to hit escape.
[10032.86s -> 10034.30s]  No, I can't go anywhere.
[10034.30s -> 10035.58s]  I don't have any options or anything.
[10050.41s -> 10055.21s]  Deleting the game.
[10058.39s -> 10060.23s]  Oh, I had them in a perfect spot, too.
[10065.34s -> 10067.26s]  God, somebody buy the rights to this
[10067.26s -> 10068.54s]  so we can get a better version.
[10070.60s -> 10091.93s]  Ask Bill Gates.
[10097.64s -> 10100.20s]  Oh, God, I keep forgetting that's in here.
[10100.76s -> 10107.00s]  Oh, he is.
[10112.63s -> 10120.97s]  Okay, so now let's see what this...
[10123.67s -> 10127.34s]  Moves over here, that moves over here.
[10128.30s -> 10129.34s]  All right, almost done.
[10134.68s -> 10147.24s]  No, and I cannot bunch them together either, unfortunately.
[10147.24s -> 10150.92s]  I can't hit shift or control or alt.
[10151.56s -> 10153.32s]  You have to do it individually.
[10160.81s -> 10162.01s]  The music is overlapping,
[10162.01s -> 10164.01s]  but I don't think I can do anything about it.
[10164.01s -> 10165.58s]  How did I do this last time?
[10191.16s -> 10194.98s]  It's going to be further out.
[10205.99s -> 10225.54s]  This is nothing but fart and burp jokes.
[10225.54s -> 10228.42s]  I know, everybody pre-oppressed me in doing this.
[10233.11s -> 10233.91s]  I'm sorry.
[10235.02s -> 10235.66s]  And I wouldn't have...
[10235.66s -> 10237.02s]  You wouldn't have to see it so many times
[10237.02s -> 10238.86s]  if I didn't have to do this stupid shit
[10238.86s -> 10240.46s]  with the no undo button.
[10247.99s -> 10250.42s]  Getting closer.
[10275.51s -> 10275.99s]  I'm done.
[10276.55s -> 10277.83s]  I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[10277.83s -> 10278.87s]  I'm out of this, we're gone.
[10300.86s -> 10305.22s]  He said to be moved a little bit.
[10312.92s -> 10313.24s]  Okay.
[10314.76s -> 10317.24s]  This goes forward, this goes forward, this goes forward.
[10317.24s -> 10318.04s]  We're ready.
[10318.04s -> 10318.52s]  Export.
[10352.15s -> 10354.25s]  Okay, goodbye.
[10355.29s -> 10357.13s]  Save the stupid movie.
[10357.13s -> 10358.97s]  Save, it saves, it's done.
[10359.69s -> 10360.25s]  I'm almost...
[10360.25s -> 10360.81s]  It's over.
[10360.81s -> 10362.97s]  It's time to export this piece of shit.
[10410.76s -> 10411.24s]  Don't waste...
[10411.88s -> 10413.08s]  He comes back to life again?
[10413.72s -> 10417.91s]  All right, that's it.
[10417.91s -> 10427.77s]  I'm done.
[10430.04s -> 10431.48s]  That's it, export the movie.
[10431.48s -> 10452.73s]  That looks good.
[10452.73s -> 10455.16s]  Bottom right.
[10455.16s -> 10456.44s]  Yeah, export movie.
[10456.44s -> 10458.28s]  How do I get rid of all this?
[10458.28s -> 10460.22s]  There's got to be a way I can cut that.
[10460.22s -> 10460.94s]  I just don't know.
[10460.94s -> 10465.32s]  All right, export movie.
[10465.32s -> 10467.16s]  If you want to have audio in your exported movie,
[10467.16s -> 10468.76s]  you must first update the soundtrack
[10468.76s -> 10470.60s]  by playing the movie from start to finish.
[10470.60s -> 10471.80s]  Do you want to do this now?
[10511.54s -> 10646.04s]  Hey, I remember how to play the...
[10646.04s -> 10647.56s]  I remember how to use the controls now.
[10650.68s -> 10653.90s]  Can I export the fucking movie now, please?
[10658.41s -> 10659.61s]  I already did that.
[10659.61s -> 10665.46s]  What are you talking about?
[10665.46s -> 10666.02s]  Wait, what?
[10669.06s -> 10671.22s]  Output name, high, highest.
[10671.22s -> 10677.75s]  Wait, what is this talking about?
[10677.75s -> 10679.59s]  Is this going to just save it to my computer?
[10681.99s -> 10683.03s]  I'm so confused.
[10684.68s -> 10685.40s]  Yeah, highest.
[10689.08s -> 10691.40s]  Oh my God, my like fucking stomach hurts.
[10693.10s -> 10695.34s]  It was like when he snaps his neck like twice.
[10696.57s -> 10698.09s]  It's just like so awful.
[10698.09s -> 10699.13s]  It's unnecessary.
[10700.44s -> 10701.72s]  All right, let's just get out of town.
[10702.36s -> 10712.02s]  Now it has like a vignette all over it too.
[10718.86s -> 10721.26s]  I actually am physically exporting this.
[10732.10s -> 10733.14s]  All right, now we're going to make...
[10734.41s -> 10735.69s]  I saw it in the chat earlier
[10735.69s -> 10738.09s]  and it is the thing that I want to make.
[10738.09s -> 10740.65s]  We're going to make constant conflict.
[10740.65s -> 10742.01s]  That is what I thought to make.
[10755.85s -> 10757.77s]  I do want to figure out a couple of things though.
[10760.20s -> 10762.20s]  Mainly free camera stuff.
[10762.20s -> 10765.21s]  Well, all right, it's been uploaded.
[10766.97s -> 10768.86s]  Save it.
[10768.86s -> 10770.06s]  And that's it, right?
[10771.40s -> 10774.57s]  Is this now all edited together?
[10774.57s -> 10775.13s]  I think it is.
[10775.77s -> 10780.02s]  So I just release it now.
[10780.02s -> 10780.74s]  Ready for release.
[10781.30s -> 10787.58s]  Let's see what they say.
[10788.14s -> 10794.31s]  Script quality is not very good.
[10794.31s -> 10794.87s]  It's all right.
[10797.86s -> 10799.06s]  I don't even want to watch it again.
[10800.26s -> 10801.22s]  I don't want to watch it again.
[10801.86s -> 10805.82s]  I don't want to watch it again.
[10805.82s -> 10841.51s]  No, we've already seen it.
[10841.51s -> 10846.07s]  We've already seen it.
[10846.07s -> 10853.30s]  We don't need to watch it a sixth time.
[10853.30s -> 10856.50s]  The crew was clueless, inexperienced cretins.
[10859.18s -> 10861.66s]  The overall quality of acting in this movie is appalling.
[10862.52s -> 10865.00s]  Howard's Poor Direction didn't do this movie any favors.
[10865.00s -> 10866.36s]  Leo was shockingly bad.
[10875.21s -> 10876.57s]  Making money though, that's all that matters.
[10879.85s -> 10882.41s]  I need to can this because it's just kind of sitting here.
[10883.69s -> 10886.25s]  How do I just like get rid of this?
[10886.97s -> 10889.93s]  It's got to be like a throw, call it, can it.
[10889.93s -> 10892.70s]  There we go.
[10892.70s -> 10898.34s]  All right, let's do another one.
[10899.08s -> 10901.80s]  This one's going to be a little bit more elaborate.
[10901.80s -> 10902.68s]  We need some more sets.
[10904.39s -> 10911.61s]  Let's do cellar, war, battle.
[10911.61s -> 10912.65s]  I'm going to be a battlefield.
[10913.29s -> 10915.82s]  I'm going to make constant conflict.
[10921.16s -> 10925.24s]  Let's do a living room.
[10931.67s -> 10933.27s]  Going to need an office.
[10937.05s -> 10942.65s]  Going to need a traveling vehicle, automobile.
[10948.92s -> 10953.78s]  Wild west desert, wild west jail.
[10954.66s -> 10957.08s]  I already have the war battlefield in the street.
[10958.44s -> 10962.01s]  I already have the bathroom.
[10965.03s -> 10967.91s]  And a couple of years, time does have to pass.
[10968.63s -> 10973.21s]  Let's get the desert in here too.
[10973.21s -> 10974.33s]  I'm probably going to need it somehow.
[10982.42s -> 10986.57s]  All right, so we're going to start in the house.
[10988.84s -> 10995.00s]  So constant conflict is going to start opening in a regular group of friends.
[10995.64s -> 10999.62s]  Remember what happened in the beginning of Cloverfield?
[10999.62s -> 11001.62s]  Where it's just like, holy shit, something's going down.
[11002.58s -> 11004.12s]  I'm going to start here.
[11004.92s -> 11007.61s]  There's going to be like an earthquake and they're going to investigate the earthquake.
[11007.61s -> 11010.81s]  It's going to be like this fucking aliens invading and then they all have to have scars on their face.
[11011.53s -> 11015.29s]  Okay, what else do I need?
[11015.29s -> 11015.77s]  Anything else?
[11019.14s -> 11019.54s]  The bank?
[11020.18s -> 11022.47s]  Maybe just like a, just have them all.
[11029.38s -> 11030.74s]  Jail street.
[11034.70s -> 11035.66s]  Sci-fi star bridge.
[11040.14s -> 11041.66s]  Make an E3 conference.
[11042.86s -> 11046.52s]  I mean, good.
[11046.52s -> 11047.00s]  Cellar.
[11047.00s -> 11047.48s]  All right.
[11047.48s -> 11048.52s]  I think we can work with this.
[11050.04s -> 11051.64s]  Make an E3 conference.
[11053.86s -> 11054.50s]  Do you want me to make it?
[11057.22s -> 11059.86s]  Constant conflict is probably going to take like the next two and a half hours.
[11062.23s -> 11064.39s]  I need like the blue screen.
[11064.39s -> 11072.65s]  We need time to go by because you can't start any...
[11072.65s -> 11074.65s]  I wish I could start in like 2000.
[11075.61s -> 11079.34s]  All right, I'll use my voice too.
[11080.86s -> 11082.14s]  We'll show some like...
[11082.14s -> 11083.18s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[11083.18s -> 11088.54s]  The game is constant conflict is the game that they're showing with E3.
[11089.18s -> 11093.22s]  But that makes sense, doesn't it?
[11095.19s -> 11096.15s]  But I need...
[11096.15s -> 11099.59s]  I know there's a blue screen, but I don't think I have it yet.
[11101.51s -> 11102.87s]  We're not in like the fucking...
[11102.87s -> 11103.83s]  We're in like the 50s.
[11106.47s -> 11108.71s]  You can edit the INI file to start in like 2000.
[11119.26s -> 11120.30s]  Yeah, I'll fast forward it.
[11120.94s -> 11122.22s]  Let me save it here and then I'm gonna...
[11123.02s -> 11125.56s]  Let me save game.
[11125.56s -> 11129.62s]  Just call it P Pants because that's the name of the studio.
[11130.98s -> 11134.90s]  I'm gonna edit the INI so we can actually be in the year 2000.
[11136.78s -> 11139.69s]  And then yeah, I'll bind undo as well.
[11139.69s -> 11142.25s]  I got a P, so I spent three hours.
[11142.25s -> 11143.21s]  I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[11143.21s -> 11144.01s]  I'll be right back.
[11145.66s -> 11152.92s]  And then when you come back, there will be the year 2000.
[11154.68s -> 11157.48s]  Blue screen, green screen, constant conflict.
[11158.20s -> 11159.08s]  I'll be back in a few minutes.
[11408.34s -> 11409.62s]  Okay, give me just a sec.
[11411.54s -> 11413.30s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[11413.30s -> 11415.30s]  Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[11418.41s -> 11419.45s]  Okay, INI file.
[11420.17s -> 11423.51s]  Let's get that open.
[11424.23s -> 11425.56s]  I got some water too.
[11426.98s -> 11427.86s]  I'm thirsty.
[11430.73s -> 11433.13s]  Okay, where do I do this?
[11433.13s -> 11434.65s]  I remember it's in a weird spot, isn't it?
[11435.45s -> 11447.00s]  Look for unlocking INI.
[11449.03s -> 11451.19s]  Unlocking INI.
[11457.45s -> 11459.78s]  Where the hell is that?
[11462.15s -> 11462.95s]  Let me see.
[11462.95s -> 11463.99s]  I gotta like look it up.
[11468.87s -> 11469.59s]  It's not here.
[11475.30s -> 11480.38s]  Data, scenario, scenes, text.
[11481.58s -> 11483.53s]  Where the hell is this?
[11501.32s -> 11503.08s]  I think it's the registry.
[11503.08s -> 11504.52s]  I think I could do it in the registry.
[11516.33s -> 11519.21s]  Yeah, I could allow any decade and change the value to one.
[11520.17s -> 11522.25s]  Let's hope this doesn't break.
[11522.89s -> 11530.90s]  Or is it in my documents file?
[11530.90s -> 11533.75s]  Oh, would that work?
[11533.75s -> 11534.15s]  Let's see.
[11535.74s -> 11537.34s]  I don't think, no, maybe it is right here.
[11538.06s -> 11539.50s]  All right, hold on.
[11540.22s -> 11544.44s]  I have to get out of town here.
[11545.00s -> 11550.90s]  No, it's not here.
[11555.94s -> 11558.98s]  Oh, I can't really go searching for this right now.
[11559.78s -> 11561.86s]  I definitely have enough to do what I want to do.
[11562.89s -> 11566.73s]  At least for, let me see.
[11569.26s -> 11571.34s]  Anybody offhand of any idea where this is?
[11571.90s -> 11576.17s]  Because I don't see it anywhere.
[11576.17s -> 11577.29s]  Or do I have to make one?
[11578.01s -> 11579.69s]  The text document, you know what I'm saying?
[11580.41s -> 11583.37s]  It's in the documents.
[11583.37s -> 11584.97s]  I'm in my documents right now.
[11584.97s -> 11586.97s]  The movies, and I don't see anything.
[11586.97s -> 11591.75s]  I see save games, movie sounds, graphics.
[11592.47s -> 11599.11s]  And maybe an app data.
[11599.11s -> 11599.83s]  That's possible.
[11599.83s -> 11600.23s]  Hold on.
[11600.95s -> 11610.57s]  There's Lionhead, the movies.
[11611.45s -> 11613.75s]  There's an OS detect.
[11615.03s -> 11616.23s]  This is not an I&I.
[11617.75s -> 11617.99s]  Shit.
[11624.52s -> 11626.60s]  I'm in app data right now and there's no
[11628.74s -> 11631.06s]  Lionhead studios in app data roaming.
[11640.70s -> 11641.74s]  Yeah, it's not in here.
[11641.74s -> 11643.18s]  Unless it's, is it hidden?
[11650.02s -> 11652.34s]  I've got an unlocking.ini there for me.
[11653.30s -> 11655.58s]  Why do I, how come I don't have one?
[11656.22s -> 11667.08s]  Let me like, see if I can, is it hidden?
[11667.80s -> 11675.22s]  Maybe it's a hidden file.
[11678.62s -> 11681.26s]  It's not a, it's not a hidden file for me.
[11681.26s -> 11682.86s]  Show hidden files and folders.
[11682.86s -> 11683.90s]  Where the fuck is it then?
[11687.35s -> 11689.43s]  Yeah, I have hidden files showing right now.
[11699.78s -> 11702.18s]  I'm gonna have to get this done like off stream.
[11702.18s -> 11703.70s]  So I, because this, it's not here.
[11705.14s -> 11708.84s]  Once I unload all the mods on the next stream for this game.
[11715.72s -> 11717.24s]  Either that or I have to edit the registry
[11717.24s -> 11718.84s]  and I feel like I'll break the fucking whole game.
[11725.70s -> 11727.46s]  It's a hidden file in app data.
[11727.46s -> 11728.50s]  That's where I am right now.
[11729.30s -> 11734.02s]  I have, I'm in app data, I'm in Lionhead studios
[11734.02s -> 11736.98s]  and the only thing that's there with hidden files turned on
[11738.12s -> 11742.44s]  is this file that says OS detect, that's it.
[11744.92s -> 11746.12s]  Well, I'll try the registry thing
[11746.12s -> 11748.76s]  but I might have to remake the whole game.
[11748.76s -> 11749.16s]  Let's see.
[11751.42s -> 11752.38s]  I'll do the registry.
[11753.10s -> 11755.26s]  If this doesn't work then I'll have to get it done
[11755.26s -> 11756.78s]  for when we put the mods in.
[11760.82s -> 11764.98s]  All right, it is in, I'm there in the movies.
[11769.46s -> 11773.62s]  Allow any decade is about to be turned into one.
[11773.62s -> 11774.82s]  The value is one.
[11775.62s -> 11779.75s]  Let's see if that worked.
[11780.47s -> 11784.36s]  If I have to start a new game I might have to
[11785.16s -> 11789.96s]  because I think I have to pick the decade unfortunately.
[11790.52s -> 11792.31s]  Let's give it a try.
[11793.03s -> 11807.30s]  All right, here we go.
[11807.30s -> 11809.62s]  Let's see if it works.
[11817.58s -> 11820.71s]  Set it to two and break everything.
[11825.40s -> 11830.38s]  Oh, okay.
[11834.63s -> 11836.63s]  Yeah, I'm gonna have to,
[11836.63s -> 11838.31s]  I think I'm gonna have to do another one
[11838.31s -> 11841.16s]  because see, watch this ready.
[11841.16s -> 11846.65s]  Yeah, I have to start another one.
[11846.65s -> 11848.25s]  Unfortunately, we have to.
[11848.25s -> 11855.00s]  It's all right though, it's not,
[11855.00s -> 11859.99s]  that's not any time at all.
[11859.99s -> 11861.75s]  I have the same actors and everything so don't worry.
[11866.20s -> 11881.59s]  They can misbehave, that's fine.
[11881.59s -> 11892.60s]  A hundred million dollars, that's right.
[11892.60s -> 11894.44s]  All right, just got to bring everybody back.
[11896.97s -> 11900.25s]  All right, let's go.
[11900.25s -> 11905.29s]  I need a import, bring them all back in.
[11912.95s -> 11917.24s]  Sandler, somebody has to be a director, right?
[11920.15s -> 11922.39s]  And I need import star.
[11922.39s -> 11924.07s]  I need to know who else.
[11924.07s -> 11927.86s]  All right, who's the director for you?
[11933.93s -> 11935.37s]  No sound, sorry.
[11935.37s -> 11936.33s]  I had to mute it.
[11936.33s -> 11944.25s]  All right, we got a director.
[11944.25s -> 11945.21s]  We have our actors.
[11945.77s -> 11947.61s]  Let's go.
[11947.61s -> 11951.02s]  Data talent's on YouTube already.
[11952.02s -> 11953.54s]  How the hell did you do it that fast?
[11954.18s -> 11956.47s]  So now, look at this.
[11957.27s -> 11958.07s]  There we are.
[11960.76s -> 11966.04s]  Field, graveyard, must be, alien world, stage.
[11966.76s -> 11970.18s]  Suburban bathroom, suburban living room.
[11971.45s -> 11972.89s]  All right, so suburban living room.
[11973.93s -> 11974.89s]  Suburban living room.
[11981.83s -> 11984.15s]  My first movie was pirated instantly.
[11990.46s -> 11991.58s]  Alien world.
[11996.33s -> 12001.32s]  Let's get stage for our E3 presentation.
[12001.32s -> 12004.20s]  Stage, I believe you can put a green screen behind it.
[12007.37s -> 12009.21s]  Suburban street is another one.
[12009.93s -> 12013.27s]  You have to have like the chaos.
[12013.91s -> 12019.70s]  Then we need only a few more things.
[12020.66s -> 12022.68s]  Tropical beach, why not?
[12032.10s -> 12035.29s]  Alleyway, bar, yeah, we want a bar.
[12036.49s -> 12037.45s]  I wanted a lot of things.
[12037.45s -> 12038.09s]  I want everything.
[12041.78s -> 12045.94s]  Rooftop for the inevitable chase scene.
[12049.24s -> 12054.15s]  Subway carriage, hotel room, subway station.
[12055.82s -> 12056.94s]  There's a lot of sets.
[12057.96s -> 12060.04s]  We got unlimited money though, so it doesn't matter.
[12060.04s -> 12068.76s]  Battlefield, we need this too for when we fight the aliens.
[12069.88s -> 12073.48s]  Yeah, I'm really going big here, but you know what's going to happen.
[12073.48s -> 12076.04s]  There's going to be like a fucking neck snap and then a fart sound.
[12077.08s -> 12078.84s]  And then somebody like falls down or something.
[12078.84s -> 12080.44s]  You think this is going to be a big elaborate movie.
[12081.08s -> 12085.24s]  I'm out of space.
[12085.24s -> 12086.60s]  I feel like I can move shit around.
[12087.24s -> 12087.72s]  Hold on.
[12090.58s -> 12091.86s]  Move rehab out of the way.
[12092.50s -> 12098.55s]  I think I need like a builder.
[12098.55s -> 12099.43s]  No, this is good.
[12099.43s -> 12099.91s]  This is good.
[12099.91s -> 12100.39s]  This is good.
[12100.95s -> 12101.99s]  There's plenty.
[12101.99s -> 12103.96s]  I got like the alien world.
[12103.96s -> 12104.36s]  I've got...
[12105.00s -> 12108.36s]  I can't fit that right here.
[12108.36s -> 12108.68s]  I can't.
[12108.68s -> 12109.16s]  Okay, good.
[12109.88s -> 12110.28s]  One more.
[12123.30s -> 12123.62s]  Shit.
[12125.03s -> 12125.27s]  All right.
[12125.27s -> 12125.75s]  No, that's good.
[12125.75s -> 12125.99s]  That's good.
[12125.99s -> 12126.31s]  That's fine.
[12126.31s -> 12127.03s]  That's fine.
[12127.03s -> 12128.15s]  Just get rid of the rehab.
[12128.87s -> 12135.53s]  No, this is all right.
[12135.53s -> 12138.33s]  This is all right.
[12138.33s -> 12139.77s]  Okay, here we go.
[12140.41s -> 12141.13s]  Custom script.
[12142.66s -> 12144.18s]  I need the custom script office.
[12146.52s -> 12149.53s]  I also need a post-production office.
[12150.81s -> 12152.63s]  All right.
[12152.63s -> 12153.51s]  No, I already have one.
[12153.51s -> 12156.98s]  Okay, here we go.
[12158.90s -> 12159.46s]  It's time.
[12159.46s -> 12164.25s]  The name of this movie.
[12165.29s -> 12166.49s]  This is an action movie.
[12168.66s -> 12171.26s]  Well, actually, I don't know.
[12171.26s -> 12172.30s]  This is E3.
[12173.26s -> 12174.46s]  It would be an action movie, right?
[12179.82s -> 12181.02s]  Okay, let's do...
[12181.02s -> 12191.08s]  We need to have the person presenting.
[12191.80s -> 12193.00s]  Let's have this be...
[12200.90s -> 12202.92s]  This can be Adam Sandler.
[12203.56s -> 12207.32s]  I said we need to change this to a better outfit.
[12208.04s -> 12209.66s]  No, that's not...
[12209.66s -> 12210.38s]  This is better.
[12210.38s -> 12221.58s]  It comes out in pinstripes.
[12222.22s -> 12223.58s]  I like that a little better.
[12224.97s -> 12226.09s]  I like that a little better.
[12238.50s -> 12244.12s]  No, no, no latex heads.
[12244.76s -> 12249.37s]  This is fine.
[12252.74s -> 12253.06s]  All right.
[12253.06s -> 12253.46s]  No, no.
[12253.46s -> 12254.02s]  This is fine.
[12254.02s -> 12254.90s]  This is just a suit.
[12256.74s -> 12260.70s]  Eye, makeup, shape, facial hair, na...
[12260.70s -> 12260.86s]  All right.
[12260.86s -> 12261.42s]  This is fine.
[12268.94s -> 12270.14s]  And then this is...
[12271.02s -> 12278.07s]  Commander...
[12280.66s -> 12282.02s]  We got to have a little...
[12282.02s -> 12282.58s]  A story here.
[12282.58s -> 12282.98s]  We have...
[12287.72s -> 12288.52s]  No, no, no.
[12288.52s -> 12291.08s]  The studio head is the person that's presenting E3.
[12291.08s -> 12292.28s]  We have to have a main character.
[12292.28s -> 12293.32s]  There's two games to show.
[12295.78s -> 12299.26s]  Leo as Captain...
[12300.71s -> 12301.83s]  Or like Grunge.
[12302.79s -> 12310.30s]  What's like a hard name?
[12310.30s -> 12312.30s]  Like Rick Grunge or something.
[12316.47s -> 12317.11s]  No, no, no, no.
[12320.63s -> 12321.19s]  Rock like...
[12323.64s -> 12324.36s]  Rock hard...
[12325.32s -> 12333.50s]  Rock hurdman?
[12333.50s -> 12334.70s]  Rock hard...
[12337.19s -> 12337.83s]  Never mind.
[12338.79s -> 12339.03s]  Rock...
[12345.46s -> 12346.26s]  Rocky Rick?
[12351.06s -> 12351.38s]  Rock...
[12352.26s -> 12367.59s]  Don...
[12367.59s -> 12368.55s]  Don...
[12368.55s -> 12369.51s]  Don Rock?
[12369.51s -> 12372.15s]  Commander Don Rock.
[12372.15s -> 12373.75s]  Commander Donald Rock.
[12373.75s -> 12383.27s]  No, this is just Don the Rock.
[12383.27s -> 12384.07s]  Like, no.
[12384.07s -> 12384.55s]  No, no, no.
[12384.55s -> 12385.11s]  No Rock.
[12410.39s -> 12412.66s]  I'm not going to...
[12412.66s -> 12413.62s]  No, not that one.
[12413.62s -> 12420.97s]  Kurt...
[12421.53s -> 12423.22s]  Kurt Frightener?
[12423.22s -> 12425.53s]  Kurt Frightener.
[12425.53s -> 12429.59s]  Command...
[12429.59s -> 12435.70s]  Commander Kurt Frightener.
[12435.70s -> 12436.98s]  Yeah, and it's going to be...
[12436.98s -> 12443.53s]  It's going to be Jax.
[12443.53s -> 12445.77s]  We also need like an alien.
[12445.77s -> 12448.01s]  But I think we can have some extras be aliens, right?
[12448.01s -> 12457.43s]  So we've got Jax and I'm saying Leo can be here.
[12461.54s -> 12463.54s]  Also, we need to change your costume.
[12463.54s -> 12464.90s]  Because that's not what you're going to be wearing.
[12468.46s -> 12472.84s]  It's going to be in one of these outfits that looks cool.
[12473.72s -> 12474.92s]  Not a clown costume.
[12475.96s -> 12476.60s]  Sorry, guys.
[12478.60s -> 12484.58s]  Is he just like a cop?
[12484.58s -> 12485.38s]  No, is there...
[12485.38s -> 12486.18s]  Is it like a marine?
[12486.18s -> 12487.14s]  Like a space marine?
[12488.02s -> 12503.58s]  Invisible ghost?
[12503.58s -> 12510.06s]  Here we go.
[12510.06s -> 12511.02s]  This is not bad.
[12511.02s -> 12520.94s]  No, but this is just like his day as the space marine commander or something.
[12520.94s -> 12523.66s]  Space suit.
[12523.66s -> 12524.94s]  Okay, so that's all right.
[12527.19s -> 12528.39s]  That's a good starting costume.
[12530.34s -> 12530.98s]  Swedish.
[12532.42s -> 12533.94s]  Swedish space marine.
[12535.88s -> 12538.28s]  And then this has to be an alien of some sort.
[12538.28s -> 12544.25s]  Okay, let's go with...
[12545.05s -> 12545.53s]  Back here.
[12546.89s -> 12549.30s]  I could do like monsters, right?
[12555.62s -> 12558.65s]  I mean, I kind of like it.
[12558.65s -> 12561.93s]  This is like an enemy you would be shooting at in like Doom, right?
[12567.80s -> 12569.24s]  Okay, this is the E3 presentation.
[12569.88s -> 12571.67s]  Here is the studio head.
[12571.67s -> 12572.63s]  We've got Kurt Frightener.
[12574.26s -> 12574.90s]  Kurt Vicks, no.
[12575.62s -> 12579.46s]  They always have something like outrageous like...
[12585.67s -> 12588.15s]  Like Warlord Kleksis or something.
[12588.15s -> 12598.74s]  They always have to have like two Xs in their name.
[12598.74s -> 12599.70s]  Warlord Kleks.
[12603.85s -> 12604.33s]  Sounds good.
[12607.83s -> 12611.96s]  All right, here we go.
[12611.96s -> 12613.56s]  So our presentation begins.
[12615.22s -> 12621.88s]  We need a stage.
[12621.88s -> 12624.12s]  Which where is it?
[12624.12s -> 12624.52s]  Stage.
[12627.85s -> 12629.53s]  And this is just static.
[12629.53s -> 12633.59s]  We got to get in here.
[12636.31s -> 12638.15s]  I don't know what you all are doing here.
[12638.71s -> 12640.55s]  I don't know why there are these people here.
[12641.35s -> 12642.49s]  But we need a backdrop.
[12642.49s -> 12643.93s]  We need to change the set.
[12645.80s -> 12646.60s]  Not a household.
[12646.60s -> 12647.40s]  We want it to be...
[12648.28s -> 12649.30s]  I don't know.
[12649.30s -> 12650.74s]  We got to change the background.
[12650.74s -> 12653.03s]  Where is it here?
[12653.03s -> 12653.83s]  Change backdrop.
[12653.83s -> 12654.23s]  There it is.
[12659.66s -> 12660.22s]  Forest.
[12660.22s -> 12667.83s]  Is it just like a road?
[12667.83s -> 12677.00s]  There isn't just like a computer screen or like a green screen?
[12677.64s -> 12682.94s]  I thought they had that.
[12686.10s -> 12686.58s]  I thought they did.
[12686.58s -> 12687.30s]  I thought they had that.
[12696.78s -> 12697.42s]  Alleyway.
[12701.29s -> 12702.22s]  Could be this.
[12702.38s -> 12704.62s]  Although, I don't know why this is all here.
[12704.62s -> 12705.58s]  Can you all go away?
[12706.78s -> 12711.29s]  None of you have to be here.
[12712.49s -> 12716.20s]  E3 in the alleyway.
[12717.08s -> 12718.44s]  All right, we're going to do a stat...
[12718.44s -> 12724.98s]  Okay, first of all, I need to find out how to move this camera freeform.
[12725.78s -> 12726.58s]  Let me see this.
[12726.58s -> 12729.99s]  Viewing your scene.
[12729.99s -> 12731.19s]  Pause sliders.
[12731.91s -> 12735.00s]  Choosing scenes.
[12735.72s -> 12736.44s]  Searching for a scene.
[12736.44s -> 12745.42s]  No, no, no.
[12745.42s -> 12746.06s]  I know how to do all this.
[12746.06s -> 12748.14s]  I just want to keep the camera static somewhere.
[12748.14s -> 12749.26s]  All right, so where was...
[12749.26s -> 12762.07s]  This is an E3.
[12762.71s -> 12764.39s]  Who is it?
[12764.39s -> 12764.71s]  Jax?
[12767.70s -> 12770.66s]  Yeah, I know if I don't put anybody here, they're not going to show up.
[12770.66s -> 12773.06s]  Mannequins mean that they're just available.
[12773.86s -> 12775.38s]  Do I have the DLC installed?
[12775.38s -> 12776.82s]  I should, yeah.
[12776.82s -> 12778.47s]  Let me like just find out.
[12778.47s -> 12779.59s]  Let me make sure I have that.
[12780.74s -> 12781.46s]  It's installed.
[12782.66s -> 12784.50s]  I'm using the EXE for that.
[12786.14s -> 12786.62s]  You know what I'm saying?
[12786.62s -> 12787.50s]  Like is that...
[12787.50s -> 12788.30s]  What's going on here?
[12795.26s -> 12796.54s]  Why do I not have any stunt scenes?
[12797.10s -> 12804.84s]  Doesn't...
[12804.84s -> 12805.72s]  Wait, why is it...
[12805.72s -> 12806.68s]  Why would this not be installed?
[12807.48s -> 12808.14s]  I have the...
[12808.22s -> 12809.98s]  Yeah, I have the expansion installed.
[12809.98s -> 12812.70s]  How does it make any sense?
[12821.64s -> 12822.20s]  Wait, what?
[12827.56s -> 12828.60s]  No, I should be opening...
[12828.60s -> 12830.20s]  I should have the right game open.
[12830.20s -> 12834.55s]  I mean, I literally have the disc literally in my hand.
[12838.78s -> 12841.34s]  You have to enable stunts and effects on the campaign,
[12841.34s -> 12842.54s]  but this is just sandbox mode.
[12849.80s -> 12850.20s]  Hold on.
[12850.76s -> 12851.40s]  Back out of here.
[12855.42s -> 12856.78s]  This is very confusing to me.
[12859.83s -> 12862.23s]  Do I have to have like a stunt section?
[12864.98s -> 12865.70s]  Hold on a minute.
[12867.54s -> 12871.38s]  Weird.
[12871.38s -> 12873.14s]  Like do I have to hire a stuntman?
[12873.78s -> 12876.18s]  I don't remember this happening.
[12876.18s -> 12877.22s]  This is kind of fucked up.
[12877.94s -> 12889.32s]  Maybe it's no stunts for this scene,
[12889.96s -> 12891.88s]  but I don't think they were available in the other one either.
[12891.88s -> 12892.28s]  Hold on.
[12893.54s -> 12895.46s]  I know there's stunts for some of these,
[12895.46s -> 12896.58s]  like the bank for instance.
[12899.21s -> 12900.25s]  Yeah, wouldn't it be here?
[12901.13s -> 12901.85s]  I swear to God.
[12901.85s -> 12902.97s]  Would they have like a different...
[12904.63s -> 12906.23s]  They have a different thing on the thumbnail, don't they?
[12910.18s -> 12912.26s]  Yeah, there's different scene thumbnails.
[12919.74s -> 12921.26s]  Like there's definitely stunts here.
[12921.26s -> 12922.94s]  I'm very, very, very confused.
[12923.58s -> 12925.77s]  Back to the menu.
[12936.15s -> 12937.19s]  Back up for a second.
[12937.19s -> 12938.79s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[12938.79s -> 12947.66s]  This is fine.
[12947.66s -> 12948.54s]  We can just do it again.
[12959.98s -> 12960.14s]  No.
[12961.74s -> 12962.46s]  What the fuck?
[12962.46s -> 12963.10s]  Hold on a second.
[12963.10s -> 12963.82s]  It's not even here.
[12964.79s -> 12965.19s]  Why is it...
[12965.19s -> 12966.71s]  Why do I not have the expansion?
[12969.91s -> 12970.15s]  What?
[12974.41s -> 12975.61s]  I'm so confused.
[12984.17s -> 12984.57s]  What?
[12992.60s -> 12993.08s]  I don't think...
[12994.12s -> 12994.92s]  Let me try this.
[12995.56s -> 13002.10s]  Yeah, there's a movies...
[13005.88s -> 13007.88s]  Something broke here when I installed it.
[13007.88s -> 13008.78s]  God damn it.
[13008.78s -> 13008.94s]  No.
[13009.50s -> 13017.53s]  This is gonna work?
[13017.53s -> 13025.18s]  No, I have the patch.
[13025.66s -> 13028.04s]  Oh, come on.
[13028.04s -> 13028.92s]  Don't do this to me now.
[13029.56s -> 13034.38s]  Yeah, I was wondering because some things were just missing,
[13034.38s -> 13035.74s]  but I installed them both.
[13037.50s -> 13039.66s]  I'm launching it from the expansion EXE,
[13039.66s -> 13042.06s]  and it's telling me like it's not installed properly somehow.
[13042.62s -> 13044.70s]  Fuck me.
[13044.70s -> 13045.82s]  Don't tell me this is gonna happen.
[13046.38s -> 13053.56s]  That makes no sense.
[13062.07s -> 13063.75s]  I thought this was ready to go to.
[13063.75s -> 13064.23s]  Fuck me.
[13064.95s -> 13071.86s]  I was really looking forward to it too,
[13071.86s -> 13073.78s]  but apparently I don't know why this won't work.
[13088.73s -> 13093.50s]  I'm so confused.
[13093.50s -> 13095.50s]  Is there a way that I could see inside
[13095.50s -> 13097.42s]  of why this would be happening like this?
[13097.42s -> 13100.26s]  Like inside the actual data?
[13100.26s -> 13109.75s]  Like inside the actual folder for the game?
[13109.75s -> 13111.50s]  Is there a way I can see?
[13111.50s -> 13114.06s]  Like if the stunt stuff is installed in there?
[13114.70s -> 13119.35s]  Like a certain file or something?
[13119.35s -> 13120.31s]  Well, let me put this up.
[13129.75s -> 13131.11s]  This is so fucking frustrating.
[13133.26s -> 13133.98s]  It actually is.
[13148.58s -> 13151.74s]  Looks like it should be in there.
[13151.74s -> 13153.34s]  The stunt should have his own folder.
[13153.34s -> 13156.06s]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, but why?
[13156.06s -> 13161.26s]  No fucking idea.
[13161.26s -> 13162.54s]  Let me see what happens when I do this.
[13167.54s -> 13168.90s]  I might have to reinstall it then.
[13177.72s -> 13179.00s]  I wonder what happened.
[13179.00s -> 13181.48s]  Because I went through the process of installing it normally,
[13181.48s -> 13182.89s]  and it said it was done.
[13194.89s -> 13198.63s]  What a way to take the fucking wind out of my sales game.
[13198.63s -> 13208.95s]  Let me take a look at this.
[13209.51s -> 13215.10s]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[13215.82s -> 13218.63s]  I'm going to try something real quick and see what happens.
[13218.63s -> 13220.07s]  I'm going to run like the...
[13220.07s -> 13223.43s]  I'm going to reinstall the stunts and effects.
[13223.43s -> 13231.74s]  Setup has detected that you already have
[13231.74s -> 13236.12s]  the movie stunts and effects installed.
[13236.12s -> 13238.20s]  Well, what the fuck are you talking about?
[13238.76s -> 13243.67s]  What the fuck is happening, man?
[13248.17s -> 13250.65s]  I'm just going to run it from the disk and see what happens.
[13250.65s -> 13264.79s]  Like will it open from here?
[13264.79s -> 13266.87s]  Because maybe the EXE is fucked up.
[13267.35s -> 13278.09s]  This is beyond anything that I could ever imagine would be wrong.
[13279.37s -> 13280.73s]  Yeah, I'm running as administrator.
[13280.73s -> 13281.37s]  I don't understand.
[13287.26s -> 13292.20s]  Fuck me.
[13292.92s -> 13297.24s]  I need a no CD.
[13297.24s -> 13298.52s]  Yeah, I have the no CD.
[13298.52s -> 13300.04s]  That's what's the weird part about this.
[13302.28s -> 13315.51s]  I have the no CD already, and it's the right one.
[13315.51s -> 13326.70s]  Let me just see something here.
[13332.33s -> 13339.91s]  For the purposes of just...
[13339.91s -> 13342.31s]  I just don't want to sit here and try to...
[13343.03s -> 13348.38s]  Mmm.
[13348.38s -> 13352.71s]  Let me try one thing.
[13368.58s -> 13369.30s]  Stunts and effects.
[13371.70s -> 13372.34s]  Yeah, no CD.
[13372.34s -> 13373.14s]  I have the right one.
[13373.78s -> 13376.12s]  I don't know why it's doing this.
[13391.80s -> 13392.28s]  All right.
[13392.28s -> 13396.18s]  Well, I'm going to have to just either go...
[13397.38s -> 13398.58s]  I kind of don't know what to do.
[13402.94s -> 13414.47s]  Pray that this works.
[13414.47s -> 13422.26s]  Pray that this works.
[13422.26s -> 13423.54s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[13423.54s -> 13424.02s]  Did it work?
[13424.02s -> 13424.42s]  Did it work?
[13424.42s -> 13424.82s]  Did it work?
[13424.82s -> 13425.70s]  Did it work?
[13425.70s -> 13427.91s]  Did it work?
[13427.91s -> 13439.93s]  Did it work?
[13439.93s -> 13440.33s]  Work?
[13441.51s -> 13441.91s]  Yes!
[13448.42s -> 13449.06s]  It worked!
[13451.66s -> 13452.38s]  All right.
[13452.38s -> 13453.90s]  Why the fuck was that so...
[13453.90s -> 13455.58s]  That makes no sense.
[13455.58s -> 13465.98s]  I wish I had even a percent of explanation as to why this has happened.
[13465.98s -> 13466.94s]  Holy shit, guys.
[13466.94s -> 13468.14s]  That made no sense.
[13468.14s -> 13471.59s]  Take a look.
[13471.59s -> 13472.71s]  We're good.
[13472.71s -> 13482.23s]  Although you guys can't see now, though.
[13482.23s -> 13482.79s]  Why can't you...
[13482.79s -> 13484.07s]  Come on, capture this shit, man.
[13484.07s -> 13484.87s]  Don't do this now.
[13484.87s -> 13485.83s]  Come on, hurry up.
[13485.83s -> 13486.31s]  Let's go.
[13489.61s -> 13490.73s]  I got it on my screen.
[13491.37s -> 13491.93s]  Capture!
[13494.71s -> 13496.39s]  Capture, you piece of crap!
[13496.95s -> 13499.80s]  Stop putting up hurdles!
[13499.80s -> 13501.40s]  I want to make a movie!
[13515.61s -> 13516.73s]  What are you doing now?
[13517.90s -> 13518.62s]  It won't pull.
[13518.62s -> 13520.38s]  It won't capture it now.
[13520.38s -> 13521.42s]  Of course not.
[13521.42s -> 13526.73s]  Give me a fucking break.
[13526.73s -> 13528.57s]  Oh my god, computers suck.
[13532.62s -> 13534.22s]  Let me just try capturing the window.
[13549.98s -> 13551.34s]  Now it won't pull it.
[13551.34s -> 13552.38s]  Now it won't capture it.
[13552.94s -> 13554.14s]  It's playing, but I can't...
[13554.14s -> 13555.90s]  Now I have to capture my desktop again.
[13559.10s -> 13559.98s]  Let's hope this works.
[13563.30s -> 13564.90s]  Oh my fucking god.
[13564.90s -> 13566.50s]  I'm so pissed off right now.
[13569.46s -> 13571.46s]  You have no idea how just
[13571.46s -> 13572.58s]  pure angry I am.
[13574.57s -> 13575.21s]  It's gonna work.
[13575.21s -> 13575.85s]  It's working.
[13575.85s -> 13576.89s]  It's gonna work.
[13576.89s -> 13581.90s]  But like, holy shit, I am infuriated at the moment.
[13583.02s -> 13584.06s]  This is so stupid.
[13612.79s -> 13618.04s]  All right, here we go.
[13622.22s -> 13623.02s]  No stun injuries.
[13623.02s -> 13624.62s]  Otherwise, I don't think that people will be able to...
[13627.37s -> 13628.73s]  Let's go ahead and make all this shit again.
[13629.53s -> 13633.93s]  Well, sorry for that.
[13633.93s -> 13635.98s]  That was a lot of bullshit.
[13635.98s -> 13637.82s]  I'm as frustrated as you are.
[13637.82s -> 13639.50s]  Way more frustrated than you probably are.
[13642.54s -> 13643.66s]  But here we go.
[13643.90s -> 13644.54s]  Let's do it again.
[13658.44s -> 13658.84s]  All right.
[13666.52s -> 13667.40s]  And we're back.
[13668.39s -> 13668.95s]  We're here.
[13669.75s -> 13671.75s]  We're finally about to start.
[13673.46s -> 13674.82s]  To a hospital, it's sure.
[13687.58s -> 13688.62s]  So we need...
[13688.62s -> 13692.68s]  I need those sets back.
[13692.68s -> 13697.03s]  But there are a shitload more sets.
[13697.75s -> 13698.63s]  Because, let's see.
[13698.63s -> 13699.43s]  The green screen.
[13699.43s -> 13700.07s]  There we go.
[13700.07s -> 13700.39s]  All right.
[13701.03s -> 13703.45s]  I was wondering where the hell it was.
[13705.05s -> 13705.85s]  Very confusing.
[13712.09s -> 13721.14s]  I'm just gonna get all the sets out here.
[13722.26s -> 13728.41s]  At least the ones that I know I want to use.
[13729.53s -> 13730.65s]  A green screen.
[13732.63s -> 13741.91s]  Okay.
[13741.91s -> 13746.46s]  What does it want me to do?
[13748.30s -> 13749.66s]  Restaurant, hospital, right?
[13750.30s -> 13751.18s]  Stunt school.
[13753.22s -> 13754.26s]  Yeah, I need stunt men.
[13767.24s -> 13770.28s]  Starship Bridge 4 has stunts in it somehow.
[13770.84s -> 13774.71s]  Let's go.
[13774.71s -> 13776.87s]  I got my sci-fi corridor.
[13782.01s -> 13784.23s]  Scrolling landscape.
[13785.88s -> 13786.36s]  Stage.
[13787.24s -> 13793.13s]  Although, I'm not sure...
[13793.69s -> 13796.41s]  I think I can do this and then build what I need, right?
[13797.21s -> 13800.97s]  I think I can just make the movie and then shoot it.
[13800.97s -> 13803.21s]  And I just need to build the things that I use.
[13803.21s -> 13804.09s]  Yeah, I don't need to do this.
[13804.97s -> 13807.42s]  All right.
[13807.42s -> 13808.38s]  So get me out of here.
[13813.78s -> 13815.62s]  Let us go to the script.
[13815.62s -> 13816.98s]  Well, I need to bring in the people.
[13816.98s -> 13817.54s]  But hold on.
[13817.54s -> 13818.90s]  Here's the worst thing about this.
[13818.90s -> 13820.42s]  Are the actors going to be available?
[13820.42s -> 13822.26s]  Or do I have to make them in a separate...
[13822.26s -> 13823.14s]  That shouldn't happen, right?
[13824.02s -> 13826.55s]  It's kind of running like shit.
[13827.19s -> 13833.78s]  Why is it running like this?
[13834.58s -> 13839.22s]  Now, I'm going to do a full-on re in a second here.
[13847.42s -> 13851.08s]  Eddie.
[13851.72s -> 13854.49s]  Adam Sandler.
[13860.71s -> 13861.93s]  And you.
[13862.97s -> 13864.55s]  Now, I need you.
[13864.55s -> 13865.59s]  Somebody needs to be a director.
[13866.55s -> 13867.35s]  Which I was going to do.
[13867.91s -> 13868.63s]  Can I do any more?
[13875.53s -> 13876.09s]  Oh, shit.
[13876.09s -> 13877.29s]  I just made this person a director.
[13878.01s -> 13879.29s]  I just made Leo the director.
[13879.29s -> 13879.93s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[13880.57s -> 13881.94s]  You're an actor.
[13881.94s -> 13882.34s]  Don't worry.
[13888.28s -> 13889.32s]  Who should be the director?
[13889.32s -> 13889.88s]  No.
[13889.88s -> 13890.12s]  You.
[13891.16s -> 13892.28s]  All right.
[13892.28s -> 13892.60s]  We're good.
[13893.16s -> 13897.06s]  Let's go to the script office.
[13897.70s -> 13900.62s]  Which is down...
[13901.34s -> 13902.06s]  Cult Starzence.
[13902.06s -> 13902.62s]  What the hell is that?
[13904.30s -> 13904.94s]  Hospital.
[13904.94s -> 13905.98s]  This is post-production.
[13908.01s -> 13908.65s]  Where is the...
[13916.39s -> 13916.71s]  No.
[13916.71s -> 13917.67s]  Do I not have one?
[13924.82s -> 13925.70s]  Custom script.
[13925.70s -> 13926.42s]  I already own it.
[13926.42s -> 13927.70s]  I have no idea what the hell it is, though.
[13928.42s -> 13930.82s]  It's literally right next to me.
[13931.54s -> 13931.78s]  All right.
[13931.78s -> 13932.26s]  Here we go.
[13933.30s -> 13935.38s]  We can finally create something.
[13935.38s -> 13936.66s]  After a million years.
[13940.86s -> 13942.14s]  We already did the first one, but...
[13943.24s -> 13944.76s]  It took like 20 fucking minutes.
[13944.76s -> 13946.12s]  30 minutes to get this going again.
[13946.68s -> 13948.70s]  Let's try it again.
[13948.70s -> 13955.94s]  This is action.
[13960.68s -> 13963.59s]  Jax and Leo.
[13966.68s -> 13969.24s]  And Adam Sandler.
[13969.24s -> 13973.34s]  You are the studio head.
[13974.06s -> 13979.38s]  What was this guy's name?
[13982.58s -> 13984.82s]  Kurt Rock?
[13991.30s -> 13992.26s]  Brock Hardman?
[13992.26s -> 13992.82s]  No, no, no, no.
[13992.82s -> 13994.34s]  It was Kurt Frightener.
[13994.34s -> 13994.58s]  Yeah.
[13995.30s -> 14000.76s]  Pogo Stick?
[14001.40s -> 14005.46s]  All right.
[14005.46s -> 14006.10s]  Good.
[14006.10s -> 14010.06s]  Now it's you do costumes.
[14019.19s -> 14019.43s]  Go.
[14022.97s -> 14023.69s]  You.
[14023.69s -> 14024.09s]  Over here.
[14033.45s -> 14035.21s]  He's in a firefighter outfit?
[14035.21s -> 14035.45s]  No.
[14036.57s -> 14037.85s]  It's like the Space Marine one.
[14037.85s -> 14038.25s]  Where is it?
[14038.81s -> 14046.47s]  Did I pass it already?
[14049.66s -> 14050.22s]  Oh, here we go.
[14050.78s -> 14052.73s]  This is better.
[14053.37s -> 14055.32s]  I like that better than the other one.
[14058.23s -> 14059.75s]  And then this had that was like the lizard.
[14070.20s -> 14071.32s]  Or should it be the lizard?
[14073.99s -> 14074.23s]  Yeah.
[14075.27s -> 14075.83s]  I think so.
[14079.58s -> 14079.98s]  All right.
[14082.07s -> 14083.19s]  Welcome to E3.
[14084.71s -> 14085.19s]  Finally.
[14085.75s -> 14086.31s]  Let's go.
[14090.18s -> 14094.49s]  We're starting on the stage.
[14094.49s -> 14104.84s]  Stunts.
[14104.84s -> 14105.96s]  Thank God.
[14105.96s -> 14112.60s]  I was about to throw up all of my insides.
[14112.60s -> 14113.40s]  So we need to do...
[14114.92s -> 14116.06s]  Just get static here.
[14120.57s -> 14121.21s]  There we go.
[14121.21s -> 14121.61s]  All right.
[14121.61s -> 14122.57s]  See, free cam.
[14124.25s -> 14125.37s]  That's what I was...
[14125.37s -> 14126.25s]  You see what's happening?
[14126.25s -> 14126.73s]  You know what I mean?
[14126.73s -> 14128.09s]  I was like, what the fuck was happening?
[14128.09s -> 14129.45s]  Why can I not move the camera?
[14129.45s -> 14130.25s]  I didn't have the...
[14130.25s -> 14133.53s]  I didn't have the fucking EXE installed somehow.
[14133.53s -> 14134.09s]  But I did.
[14134.09s -> 14135.45s]  I had to like replace it twice.
[14139.08s -> 14139.40s]  All right.
[14139.40s -> 14141.08s]  So let's start here.
[14141.08s -> 14142.60s]  We're gonna have him walk on stage.
[14144.89s -> 14151.53s]  So I think this is just start position.
[14151.53s -> 14152.89s]  And it's end position too, right?
[14152.89s -> 14153.37s]  That's fine.
[14157.48s -> 14158.52s]  Maybe I don't even need to do that.
[14159.16s -> 14160.89s]  Let's look at it from the...
[14160.89s -> 14161.53s]  Yep.
[14161.53s -> 14162.25s]  From the camera.
[14163.13s -> 14164.22s]  All right.
[14164.22s -> 14167.10s]  Now backdrop.
[14172.73s -> 14173.61s]  Green screen.
[14176.20s -> 14178.20s]  But the green screen implies that this...
[14179.00s -> 14182.34s]  We have to be somewhere else.
[14186.82s -> 14187.78s]  This is pretty close.
[14188.34s -> 14197.50s]  This is pretty good too.
[14199.69s -> 14201.13s]  E3 on a rooftop.
[14207.19s -> 14210.07s]  It's like a news station.
[14210.07s -> 14210.87s]  This is pretty good.
[14215.48s -> 14216.68s]  Oh my God.
[14216.68s -> 14217.32s]  24.
[14217.96s -> 14224.04s]  Yeah, we're gonna do...
[14224.04s -> 14224.68s]  Oh my God.
[14224.68s -> 14225.16s]  24.
[14225.72s -> 14229.21s]  Sounds good to me.
[14231.85s -> 14232.17s]  Okay.
[14232.17s -> 14232.65s]  Stage.
[14233.67s -> 14234.07s]  Let's see.
[14236.07s -> 14239.16s]  We need to have preparation.
[14239.16s -> 14240.36s]  Walk with a briefcase.
[14240.36s -> 14247.22s]  It's got to be the right scene though.
[14247.22s -> 14248.54s]  Oh my God.
[14248.54s -> 14249.02s]  24.
[14249.58s -> 14258.65s]  Okay.
[14258.65s -> 14262.98s]  Let's slow that down a little.
[14262.98s -> 14264.02s]  By the way, let me just...
[14264.02s -> 14265.06s]  I want to just rip...
[14265.06s -> 14267.86s]  Sorry for that last like 30, 40 minutes, guys.
[14269.54s -> 14270.98s]  I was about to throw in the towel.
[14271.54s -> 14273.46s]  So like I'm back to...
[14273.46s -> 14274.18s]  We're good.
[14274.18s -> 14274.98s]  Everything's fine.
[14274.98s -> 14276.18s]  I'm sorry that that happened.
[14276.90s -> 14278.42s]  But I just want to say that I...
[14279.22s -> 14281.93s]  I was trying to handle that.
[14282.92s -> 14283.64s]  I was trying.
[14284.20s -> 14288.46s]  What happened?
[14289.02s -> 14292.22s]  The game didn't load in the expansion and I almost lost my mind.
[14294.86s -> 14295.18s]  All right.
[14295.18s -> 14299.48s]  So this needs to be a little bit longer.
[14300.28s -> 14304.68s]  Why would the case in the hand matter?
[14304.68s -> 14304.92s]  All right.
[14304.92s -> 14306.04s]  I need to do free camera here.
[14306.97s -> 14307.29s]  All right.
[14307.29s -> 14307.93s]  Start position.
[14307.93s -> 14309.13s]  We're gonna do over here.
[14312.47s -> 14314.79s]  The immersion is gonna be broken so badly.
[14316.50s -> 14319.94s]  You're shooting this in like a fucking restaurant.
[14323.77s -> 14324.81s]  Let's do start here.
[14325.53s -> 14330.54s]  And then we're gonna end here while he walks.
[14331.26s -> 14340.47s]  Let's see what that looks like.
[14340.95s -> 14348.34s]  Why would he walk by the camera?
[14355.48s -> 14356.04s]  Like stop.
[14356.04s -> 14357.16s]  I didn't turn to the camera.
[14357.16s -> 14361.48s]  He's just gonna walk by.
[14361.48s -> 14361.80s]  Okay.
[14361.80s -> 14367.37s]  Can I have him still with that in his hand?
[14367.37s -> 14368.89s]  Walk briefcase again.
[14368.89s -> 14369.29s]  Yeah.
[14369.29s -> 14370.73s]  We need a little bit more than that.
[14370.73s -> 14380.14s]  So he goes this way.
[14380.14s -> 14381.43s]  Comes over here.
[14381.43s -> 14387.05s]  Where is he?
[14387.05s -> 14390.44s]  Change the scene to another scene here.
[14391.00s -> 14394.25s]  Okay.
[14394.25s -> 14395.53s]  So he just walks by.
[14395.53s -> 14397.53s]  But we need him to walk from the other direction.
[14401.70s -> 14404.98s]  He's gonna take a long time to get to this fucking stage.
[14405.62s -> 14406.02s]  All right.
[14406.02s -> 14406.74s]  Hold on.
[14406.74s -> 14421.30s]  So I need to do go to start position is I want to move out.
[14421.30s -> 14424.04s]  How do I move the camera up?
[14425.10s -> 14425.58s]  Whoa.
[14425.58s -> 14426.86s]  What is this field of view?
[14433.08s -> 14435.16s]  How do I move the camera up?
[14435.16s -> 14435.40s]  Alt.
[14436.12s -> 14436.60s]  There we go.
[14436.60s -> 14443.21s]  Alt.
[14443.21s -> 14445.37s]  This movie is a joke compared to your magnum opus.
[14445.37s -> 14445.93s]  Get out of town.
[14445.93s -> 14450.09s]  You'll never top that heart-wrenching scene when Benedict was brutally murdered and shitted himself.
[14450.09s -> 14450.59s]  Okay.
[14451.37s -> 14471.13s]  Is that gonna be enough?
[14471.77s -> 14479.53s]  Let's see.
[14480.25s -> 14489.66s]  This stage is way is not.
[14489.66s -> 14490.94s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14490.94s -> 14497.59s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the head of Oh My God Studios.
[14500.15s -> 14503.30s]  Studio head Greg.
[14514.55s -> 14515.03s]  All right.
[14515.03s -> 14515.99s]  Should we do one more?
[14517.24s -> 14518.20s]  Or is he here?
[14518.20s -> 14526.86s]  Let's have him coming into the scene now.
[14526.86s -> 14527.82s]  Walk with a scanner.
[14527.82s -> 14529.10s]  Brandish blade.
[14529.10s -> 14530.73s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[14530.73s -> 14531.93s]  Is there any more briefcase?
[14535.21s -> 14536.01s]  Enter briefcase.
[14536.01s -> 14536.57s]  Here we go.
[14536.57s -> 14538.09s]  Enter briefcase.
[14538.09s -> 14540.66s]  What does it look like?
[14544.70s -> 14545.98s]  That's the same one.
[14545.98s -> 14547.02s]  Is it the same one?
[14557.30s -> 14557.86s]  What other?
[14557.86s -> 14559.67s]  What?
[14559.67s -> 14560.71s]  Walk briefcase.
[14560.71s -> 14562.15s]  Enter briefcase.
[14562.15s -> 14568.14s]  What about exit briefcase?
[14572.62s -> 14573.50s]  They're all the same thing.
[14576.98s -> 14577.48s]  Okay.
[14577.94s -> 14578.90s]  We're gonna change this.
[14582.14s -> 14585.34s]  Now we're just gonna have like talking.
[14585.34s -> 14586.38s]  Talk left.
[14586.38s -> 14586.62s]  All right.
[14586.62s -> 14587.18s]  So here we go.
[14587.18s -> 14587.42s]  Talk.
[14594.39s -> 14595.75s]  There's no other person here.
[14595.75s -> 14596.07s]  Don't worry.
[14596.07s -> 14597.11s]  We're not gonna even use them.
[14598.82s -> 14599.78s]  Duration long.
[14601.02s -> 14602.46s]  Left actor is happy.
[14603.69s -> 14606.17s]  And the right actor doesn't matter because the right actor is not even in the scene.
[14626.12s -> 14627.48s]  His mouth isn't even moving.
[14636.73s -> 14637.45s]  No, no, no.
[14637.45s -> 14638.33s]  Happy is not gonna work.
[14641.16s -> 14642.92s]  This needs to be something else.
[14644.73s -> 14646.57s]  Angry, romantic, sad.
[14647.74s -> 14648.46s]  Just neutral.
[14653.05s -> 14653.21s]  All right.
[14653.21s -> 14653.61s]  That's better.
[14654.41s -> 14656.65s]  Then we give the crowd cheer.
[14664.76s -> 14667.96s]  There is a person on the right that he's like talking to.
[14668.60s -> 14669.94s]  Hold on.
[14669.94s -> 14670.66s]  Is there a better one?
[14671.22s -> 14673.70s]  Is it like a just one person talk?
[14678.28s -> 14679.00s]  Now it's two people.
[14679.00s -> 14680.04s]  I can just remove the other person.
[14680.04s -> 14680.44s]  Here we go.
[14680.44s -> 14680.92s]  Talk right.
[14680.92s -> 14686.17s]  It's always gonna be talk turn.
[14687.54s -> 14688.50s]  Talk to dog.
[14690.46s -> 14691.42s]  Payphone talk.
[14695.18s -> 14695.66s]  Let's see.
[14697.24s -> 14697.64s]  Intro.
[14698.81s -> 14699.61s]  Weight lifting.
[14699.61s -> 14701.77s]  He comes out and just like lifts up a bunch of fucking weights.
[14707.50s -> 14710.41s]  Monologue.
[14710.41s -> 14714.58s]  Perfect.
[14714.58s -> 14715.38s]  See what we got here.
[14716.26s -> 14716.58s]  Mood.
[14719.83s -> 14720.63s]  Happy.
[14720.63s -> 14721.19s]  Perspective.
[14722.07s -> 14722.39s]  Why?
[14722.39s -> 14724.07s]  We can just change the duration.
[14724.79s -> 14725.19s]  Medium.
[14725.99s -> 14727.11s]  See how this goes.
[14727.11s -> 14727.35s]  Okay.
[14727.35s -> 14740.09s]  Let's get another cut here with like a close up.
[14742.60s -> 14743.08s]  Same thing.
[14743.96s -> 14751.56s]  I'll change the backdrops.
[14751.56s -> 14751.88s]  Don't worry.
[14752.52s -> 14761.58s]  Put Minecraft in the background.
[14762.14s -> 14771.53s]  Okay.
[14773.61s -> 14775.37s]  Maybe like right here.
[14778.18s -> 14780.42s]  This one he's gonna be angry.
[14782.55s -> 14782.87s]  Mood.
[14783.59s -> 14784.23s]  Argumentative.
[14786.04s -> 14786.60s]  Duration.
[14786.60s -> 14787.24s]  Abrupt.
[14787.24s -> 14788.20s]  Let's try this one on.
[14796.50s -> 14799.46s]  Apparently he didn't like the way the audience reacted to this.
[14800.10s -> 14807.26s]  I'm gonna go back here.
[14808.60s -> 14808.92s]  Yeah.
[14808.92s -> 14809.48s]  24.
[14810.36s -> 14812.55s]  Put that back here as well.
[14813.35s -> 14816.90s]  All right.
[14816.90s -> 14817.62s]  I need an audience.
[14823.45s -> 14825.85s]  Is there like a the play?
[14827.08s -> 14830.89s]  There's got to be a bar.
[14830.89s -> 14831.61s]  No, no.
[14831.61s -> 14837.03s]  Like a theater.
[14837.03s -> 14837.59s]  Jail.
[14837.59s -> 14838.39s]  Saloon.
[14838.39s -> 14838.95s]  Bedroom.
[14838.95s -> 14839.43s]  Street.
[14840.15s -> 14845.13s]  I wonder if there's like a crowd or something.
[14845.85s -> 14854.54s]  Or at least a place where people could be like sitting.
[14855.10s -> 14858.84s]  I don't think so.
[14863.67s -> 14865.27s]  Someone's just watching from their living room.
[14865.91s -> 14871.58s]  Someone's watching on their computer.
[14871.58s -> 14872.38s]  It's like a live stream.
[14873.02s -> 14877.38s]  I think we're just gonna have to do extras.
[14878.81s -> 14880.09s]  And on stage.
[14880.09s -> 14881.45s]  But with a different backdrop.
[14882.17s -> 14886.30s]  Yeah.
[14886.30s -> 14886.62s]  Let's see.
[14886.62s -> 14887.26s]  Like crowd.
[14890.18s -> 14890.50s]  No.
[14890.50s -> 14891.22s]  Like group.
[14892.98s -> 14893.70s]  Group meeting.
[14893.70s -> 14894.50s]  Group move.
[14898.71s -> 14899.11s]  Cheer.
[14902.20s -> 14904.02s]  Conversation.
[14904.02s -> 14904.74s]  Investigation.
[14904.74s -> 14905.46s]  I think we can just do.
[14906.18s -> 14909.13s]  We could probably just do static.
[14911.96s -> 14913.08s]  Sit and talk.
[14913.08s -> 14913.32s]  Yeah.
[14913.32s -> 14914.92s]  I mean that you could do sit and talk.
[14917.88s -> 14920.04s]  Sit and see people just smoking.
[14921.72s -> 14921.96s]  Yeah.
[14921.96s -> 14923.72s]  Static with a bunch of extras I think is the best.
[14924.86s -> 14926.38s]  The audience is sitting on the ground.
[14929.62s -> 14930.42s]  Let's do static.
[14934.63s -> 14941.56s]  And change the backdrop to something that looks like they're in the theater.
[14942.20s -> 14956.26s]  Burning city.
[14958.15s -> 14959.11s]  Canvas background.
[14959.67s -> 14959.91s]  No.
[14970.31s -> 14971.19s]  Falling.
[14971.19s -> 14971.51s]  Wait.
[14971.51s -> 14972.87s]  Everyone's falling.
[14972.87s -> 14981.22s]  This looks all right.
[14981.22s -> 14984.33s]  All right.
[14984.33s -> 14985.13s]  We need extras.
[14989.34s -> 14990.46s]  Supporting role.
[14990.46s -> 14992.14s]  First extra extra.
[14992.14s -> 14992.78s]  Okay.
[14992.78s -> 15005.48s]  This is going to need a lot of extras.
[15006.36s -> 15007.80s]  Okay.
[15007.80s -> 15009.96s]  How do I take like the gun away from this person?
[15019.64s -> 15021.08s]  How do I get this off?
[15031.06s -> 15032.90s]  There's no way I can get rid of this.
[15035.91s -> 15037.03s]  How do I delete this?
[15045.58s -> 15048.63s]  What is going on over here?
[15048.63s -> 15049.03s]  Yeah.
[15049.03s -> 15053.59s]  I'm just going to delete this extra.
[15053.59s -> 15057.86s]  Okay.
[15057.86s -> 15058.98s]  And this one too.
[15058.98s -> 15059.78s]  And this one.
[15059.78s -> 15060.90s]  And you as well.
[15062.02s -> 15063.70s]  You're not going to be in this movie.
[15063.70s -> 15073.11s]  And they're making zombie noises.
[15073.11s -> 15074.31s]  Wait.
[15074.31s -> 15075.35s]  Change props.
[15075.35s -> 15076.15s]  Oh shit.
[15076.15s -> 15088.18s]  Okay.
[15088.18s -> 15088.66s]  All right.
[15088.66s -> 15089.30s]  Let's see.
[15089.30s -> 15090.10s]  Change props.
[15093.21s -> 15094.01s]  Slot one.
[15095.90s -> 15096.14s]  Yeah.
[15096.14s -> 15097.34s]  I cleared the props.
[15097.90s -> 15100.97s]  So how do I?
[15100.97s -> 15102.17s]  Can I put something else in here?
[15110.98s -> 15117.27s]  All these props are just guns.
[15117.27s -> 15118.31s]  Different cell phones.
[15118.31s -> 15119.11s]  What the hell is this?
[15119.11s -> 15119.99s]  Seashell?
[15119.99s -> 15125.29s]  Okay.
[15125.29s -> 15125.45s]  No.
[15125.45s -> 15126.25s]  You don't get.
[15126.25s -> 15129.85s]  Nobody gets a gun.
[15129.85s -> 15130.09s]  Okay.
[15130.09s -> 15131.13s]  This is a banana.
[15131.13s -> 15132.97s]  You can have a banana in your hand.
[15132.97s -> 15137.02s]  That's fine.
[15137.02s -> 15137.34s]  Okay.
[15137.34s -> 15138.14s]  That's fine.
[15138.14s -> 15152.79s]  So now we can edit this and put this in a different spot.
[15152.79s -> 15154.15s]  So he talks here.
[15154.15s -> 15158.98s]  Let's make sure we got that correct.
[15158.98s -> 15162.31s]  We actually need to move the camera a little bit.
[15162.87s -> 15166.15s]  Let's do free cam.
[15166.87s -> 15175.64s]  Make it at least look like they're sitting down.
[15176.20s -> 15178.28s]  Except how would they be?
[15178.28s -> 15179.88s]  At least some of them is sitting down.
[15179.88s -> 15185.99s]  Just somebody just staring off into the distance.
[15185.99s -> 15186.23s]  All right.
[15186.23s -> 15186.79s]  That's fine.
[15187.51s -> 15190.18s]  So we go from here.
[15195.08s -> 15196.20s]  Talks about a few things.
[15196.20s -> 15198.52s]  We're going to have at least three or four different adjectives here.
[15199.16s -> 15207.56s]  And then it leads to showing the audience.
[15208.36s -> 15213.50s]  And then we come back to his reaction.
[15216.47s -> 15217.83s]  He's going to announce a mobile game.
[15218.39s -> 15219.67s]  They're all going to fucking boo.
[15221.13s -> 15223.13s]  And then he's going to say, well, let's show it.
[15233.08s -> 15234.52s]  How about let's put the monologue.
[15235.56s -> 15242.92s]  Somebody like from the audience comes up.
[15244.74s -> 15246.58s]  It's like a strangling match with them.
[15256.17s -> 15256.57s]  Okay.
[15256.57s -> 15261.34s]  So angry.
[15263.30s -> 15265.46s]  And it's going to be a short.
[15265.46s -> 15266.36s]  Let's see.
[15267.16s -> 15277.88s]  It's going to probably come up shade of my face.
[15277.88s -> 15279.56s]  This is going to make me a billion dollars.
[15281.38s -> 15282.34s]  All right, motherfucker.
[15282.34s -> 15283.86s]  And he like sprints up.
[15283.86s -> 15312.74s]  This is an extra running angry direction this way.
[15312.74s -> 15312.98s]  Yeah.
[15320.23s -> 15321.19s]  Can we slow that down?
[15328.06s -> 15332.86s]  Determined.
[15332.86s -> 15340.63s]  Determined is so fast.
[15350.92s -> 15353.16s]  Yeah, I think that's the one.
[15353.32s -> 15370.25s]  To do.
[15370.25s -> 15370.81s]  Where is it?
[15376.15s -> 15377.03s]  News logo five.
[15387.46s -> 15388.10s]  All right.
[15388.10s -> 15389.54s]  So then he's going to get like one.
[15389.54s -> 15390.66s]  He's just going to get knocked out.
[15400.10s -> 15401.78s]  The only thing is this could be a different person.
[15407.75s -> 15409.51s]  It's just going to be a random extra that's up here.
[15419.19s -> 15421.83s]  Action, tame, mild, moderate, extreme.
[15430.57s -> 15431.93s]  Holy shit.
[15439.27s -> 15440.39s]  That is extreme.
[15440.39s -> 15458.90s]  All right.
[15458.90s -> 15460.50s]  I think I just like the first perspective.
[15461.70s -> 15467.13s]  Okay.
[15468.09s -> 15470.33s]  That is we got to be on the right backdrop.
[15470.33s -> 15472.25s]  I actually have to I have to film this.
[15472.25s -> 15478.30s]  We got to get the start position over here.
[15479.80s -> 15487.40s]  So it looks like, you know, that he may have just he may have ran over here.
[15487.40s -> 15489.88s]  I don't want him in the scene yet.
[15489.88s -> 15501.93s]  And then we move forward and let's see how that looks.
[15504.60s -> 15505.64s]  Like he just queued it up.
[15506.28s -> 15515.64s]  Wait a minute.
[15515.64s -> 15528.42s]  Okay, hold on.
[15528.42s -> 15529.38s]  Start position here.
[15530.18s -> 15531.62s]  Go mark position.
[15532.34s -> 15533.78s]  Go to mark position.
[15533.78s -> 15534.02s]  Right.
[15536.42s -> 15540.36s]  And then the second position is here.
[15541.08s -> 15544.87s]  And then we mark this one too.
[15546.68s -> 15547.40s]  Mark position.
[15551.38s -> 15552.18s]  That's right, right?
[15552.82s -> 15553.66s]  Should be.
[15554.22s -> 15561.66s]  Why is it not doing it?
[15561.66s -> 15566.68s]  Shouldn't it shouldn't that position be marked here?
[15567.56s -> 15574.65s]  Because if this is position one, here's your start position.
[15576.84s -> 15585.40s]  It's marked here and I want it to move.
[15586.28s -> 15587.72s]  Yeah, it's a key frame.
[15587.72s -> 15588.28s]  So shouldn't it?
[15589.54s -> 15595.06s]  Wouldn't this be, you know, like I can't mark it here.
[15604.17s -> 15605.37s]  Not quite key framing.
[15606.42s -> 15609.06s]  Start and end equals beginning and end of the clip.
[15609.06s -> 15609.62s]  Oh, okay.
[15614.31s -> 15615.67s]  So this is beginning of the clip.
[15616.31s -> 15622.30s]  Position two is at the end right now.
[15622.30s -> 15625.38s]  So I would want it to be start position.
[15626.26s -> 15631.19s]  But wouldn't I want it to be start position and then, well,
[15631.19s -> 15632.31s]  like I have to move it forward a little?
[15640.07s -> 15643.27s]  Because I think of this like it's not key frames,
[15643.27s -> 15648.62s]  but move the camera on the second timeline.
[15651.27s -> 15652.07s]  Oh, I see here.
[15655.18s -> 15656.06s]  So I can do this.
[15656.86s -> 15658.63s]  If I mark it.
[15659.19s -> 15667.00s]  How come I can't get, I'm not, I'm not getting,
[15667.00s -> 15668.44s]  I'm not putting this together here in my head.
[15680.82s -> 15681.94s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[15681.94s -> 15683.14s]  What the hell is this doing over here?
[15690.10s -> 15691.70s]  All right.
[15691.70s -> 15701.18s]  So here we go.
[15701.18s -> 15706.02s]  See if that fixes it.
[15706.02s -> 15710.33s]  So then right, I want it to be like here.
[15710.33s -> 15724.22s]  Let's see if that does it.
[15724.22s -> 15727.03s]  Fuck.
[15727.03s -> 15727.83s]  God damn it.
[15728.55s -> 15729.59s]  What is happening here?
[15739.10s -> 15742.68s]  Camera two, what the hell?
[15742.68s -> 15743.80s]  Why did I drag it over?
[15743.80s -> 15747.34s]  What marked position?
[15747.34s -> 15748.86s]  This is camera one.
[15748.86s -> 15751.02s]  Camera one is here.
[15751.02s -> 15757.88s]  Camera two is, I want camera two to be here.
[15757.88s -> 15759.32s]  What the fuck am I doing here?
[15761.66s -> 15764.30s]  Position one, position two.
[15764.30s -> 15766.22s]  Position one, position two.
[15769.99s -> 15773.96s]  So I want it to be like, so I, it's just like weird.
[15773.96s -> 15786.70s]  Position one, position two.
[15786.70s -> 15787.10s]  Okay.
[15787.10s -> 15789.02s]  So this is, this is correct now, right?
[15789.02s -> 15802.15s]  This shit's correct.
[15802.15s -> 15802.47s]  All right.
[15802.47s -> 15802.95s]  There we go.
[15803.35s -> 15804.47s]  That's kind of a weird system.
[15807.45s -> 15814.71s]  All right.
[15814.71s -> 15815.27s]  Here we go.
[15815.27s -> 15829.46s]  I think, yeah.
[15829.46s -> 15829.62s]  Okay.
[15829.62s -> 15831.14s]  So that's going to be an edit.
[15831.14s -> 15834.26s]  So I'll edit that out.
[15834.26s -> 15836.46s]  I'm going to have him fall down
[15836.46s -> 15839.93s]  and then the trailer is going to play.
[15839.93s -> 15852.70s]  He like just fucking knocked himself out.
[15852.70s -> 15853.50s]  What would that be under?
[15853.50s -> 15853.90s]  Let's see.
[15857.91s -> 15863.69s]  Violence, dead body.
[15865.54s -> 15868.34s]  He drinks poison and then the clip plays.
[15870.68s -> 15872.12s]  Just make him fight the crowd.
[15872.68s -> 15877.11s]  Crouch shoot.
[15878.04s -> 15881.00s]  Oh, I thought the first thing I thought was crotch shoot.
[15881.00s -> 15891.96s]  What about unconscious?
[15891.96s -> 15897.53s]  Let's see.
[15897.53s -> 15903.29s]  Pursuit, resolution, impact.
[15905.70s -> 15906.74s]  Head, oh right.
[15906.74s -> 15914.36s]  This one.
[15914.36s -> 15916.12s]  He fucking head butts the guy
[15916.12s -> 15918.84s]  and then instantly gets knocked out in the trailer plays.
[15918.84s -> 15937.96s]  Now this is better.
[15937.96s -> 15939.32s]  He just already out.
[15939.32s -> 15942.30s]  Okay.
[15942.30s -> 15943.58s]  Let's change the camera here.
[15943.58s -> 15962.31s]  Okay.
[15962.31s -> 15966.15s]  So let's do, let's go to camera one.
[15966.55s -> 15971.11s]  Where's camera two?
[15977.10s -> 15997.40s]  Now I got to mark it.
[15997.40s -> 15997.88s]  Okay.
[15997.88s -> 16015.06s]  Let's see how that looks.
[16015.06s -> 16026.01s]  Now I need the E3 backdrop here.
[16026.01s -> 16026.73s]  Where's the fart?
[16026.73s -> 16031.35s]  Well, this is not post-production yet.
[16031.35s -> 16032.39s]  Yeah, we can edit that part
[16032.39s -> 16034.47s]  because when he starts shaking his head,
[16035.58s -> 16037.45s]  he's at it fall forward.
[16037.45s -> 16042.44s]  Like right there, fall forward.
[16042.44s -> 16042.68s]  Okay.
[16042.68s -> 16043.48s]  Now let's go to the,
[16044.28s -> 16048.28s]  let's just go to stage again.
[16048.28s -> 16057.16s]  We're going to zoom in to the screen.
[16057.16s -> 16060.82s]  These people aren't even going to be here.
[16060.82s -> 16067.96s]  The backdrop is going to be just normal.
[16067.96s -> 16069.40s]  I guess it could change to something.
[16079.34s -> 16087.29s]  It just zooms into this like stupid spaceship.
[16087.29s -> 16089.13s]  That could, yeah, I could do a fade too.
[16089.13s -> 16094.04s]  Yeah, this is, I don't need this.
[16094.04s -> 16094.60s]  All right.
[16094.60s -> 16096.95s]  So we've got what we want.
[16096.95s -> 16098.23s]  These are all ready.
[16098.23s -> 16107.61s]  We're going to fade into this sci-fi corridor five.
[16112.57s -> 16114.28s]  Here we go.
[16114.28s -> 16115.88s]  This is constant conflict.
[16121.35s -> 16123.83s]  So first of all, there needs to be like, I don't know,
[16123.83s -> 16125.67s]  something to grab you immediately.
[16125.67s -> 16130.62s]  Somebody's getting, somebody's got CPR performed on him.
[16130.62s -> 16148.49s]  You're like, all right.
[16148.49s -> 16151.69s]  So who's in the game?
[16152.25s -> 16153.45s]  It's his game.
[16153.45s -> 16154.09s]  He's in it.
[16154.09s -> 16155.77s]  He's like, did the motion capture?
[16160.28s -> 16160.52s]  Okay.
[16160.52s -> 16161.48s]  This is how we need.
[16165.08s -> 16167.64s]  No, he can't be in his own fucking game.
[16167.64s -> 16177.03s]  All right.
[16177.03s -> 16178.07s]  Well, who was the alien?
[16183.62s -> 16184.42s]  Does this make sense?
[16188.84s -> 16191.80s]  He's giving CPR to the alien.
[16191.80s -> 16197.90s]  Come on.
[16197.90s -> 16199.50s]  Don't you die on me.
[16199.50s -> 16212.70s]  This is taking so, that's so long.
[16216.46s -> 16218.14s]  Why is he sitting here like this?
[16221.51s -> 16223.19s]  This is way too long.
[16223.19s -> 16230.46s]  Okay.
[16230.54s -> 16238.18s]  We need lighting, weather.
[16239.74s -> 16241.42s]  Fog, because everything's all fucked up.
[16241.42s -> 16242.78s]  This ship is going down.
[16242.78s -> 16247.67s]  Okay.
[16247.67s -> 16252.15s]  Now we need, let's get some extras in here.
[16252.15s -> 16256.65s]  Or maybe a supporting character.
[16256.65s -> 16269.18s]  No, we need, can I do like aliens and shit?
[16269.18s -> 16272.01s]  What about the extras?
[16272.01s -> 16274.97s]  Can I like, how do I make everybody like a fucking alien?
[16283.51s -> 16283.83s]  Fine.
[16283.83s -> 16285.11s]  This is the first supporting role,
[16289.66s -> 16291.74s]  because I have my actors, but then I have,
[16292.46s -> 16296.26s]  can I put some random person here?
[16298.55s -> 16299.67s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[16300.31s -> 16305.93s]  I can change their costumes,
[16305.93s -> 16307.77s]  but I can't change the extras' costumes.
[16318.26s -> 16318.50s]  Hmm.
[16320.89s -> 16321.37s]  You can?
[16322.09s -> 16326.04s]  How come I got this grayed out?
[16326.04s -> 16330.94s]  How do I do that?
[16330.94s -> 16333.10s]  Drag an extra there, drag them to the hanger.
[16333.66s -> 16335.48s]  All right.
[16335.48s -> 16339.51s]  So there's an extra here and then, oh fuck.
[16339.51s -> 16339.99s]  Okay.
[16339.99s -> 16341.03s]  That just kind of popped out.
[16341.67s -> 16342.87s]  Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16342.87s -> 16347.99s]  What's going on here?
[16347.99s -> 16349.43s]  Why is the extra him?
[16349.43s -> 16359.61s]  This is strange.
[16360.17s -> 16372.84s]  You have to put a person as an extra.
[16372.84s -> 16378.62s]  Oh, so we just need, we just need like a bunch of people.
[16381.03s -> 16383.27s]  I don't have, I guess.
[16383.99s -> 16387.53s]  Can I make, can I make Jax an extra?
[16393.29s -> 16393.79s]  Wait.
[16401.13s -> 16401.61s]  Okay.
[16401.61s -> 16405.29s]  So I guess, I guess you're just going to be a robot,
[16405.29s -> 16410.71s]  but what are you defending?
[16415.80s -> 16416.04s]  All right.
[16416.04s -> 16417.48s]  We also need to have like something going on.
[16417.48s -> 16419.96s]  While this is happening, there has to be like a fucking explosion.
[16423.77s -> 16428.50s]  Stunts, fire group, a group of people run down a burning corridor,
[16428.50s -> 16438.68s]  explosion run, fight zombies, fire group, fire choke, fire staring, fire trap,
[16438.68s -> 16447.93s]  throttle victim, fire hero.
[16447.93s -> 16458.98s]  No, this is just, that's all there is here.
[16461.66s -> 16462.38s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[16462.38s -> 16463.02s]  Re-do this one.
[16470.18s -> 16471.14s]  Fight ain't over yet.
[16471.14s -> 16472.50s]  Ambush from above.
[16472.50s -> 16477.94s]  What's he holding?
[16493.51s -> 16496.54s]  Is that, what the hell is in his hand?
[16496.54s -> 16506.92s]  Is that a can opener?
[16506.92s -> 16520.15s]  Ambush from above.
[16520.15s -> 16522.98s]  What?
[16522.98s -> 16523.86s]  Oh, okay.
[16523.86s -> 16525.86s]  I'm just, what the hell happened?
[16525.86s -> 16541.32s]  Okay.
[16541.32s -> 16544.68s]  Hold on.
[16544.68s -> 16545.72s]  When does he land?
[16555.11s -> 16557.19s]  All right.
[16557.19s -> 16558.15s]  It's this surprise.
[16558.15s -> 16562.17s]  Then there's also this, and then there's ambush.
[16562.17s -> 16565.29s]  He spends a shitload of time knocking on his,
[16565.29s -> 16567.42s]  I don't even know what the hell he's holding.
[16567.42s -> 16571.45s]  Whatever it is.
[16571.45s -> 16571.85s]  Okay.
[16571.85s -> 16572.25s]  Hold on.
[16588.17s -> 16589.69s]  Spider-Man kiss.
[16589.69s -> 16591.98s]  Okay.
[16591.98s -> 16593.58s]  I don't, I don't hate this one,
[16593.58s -> 16596.06s]  but I'm going to trim a huge amount of it off.
[16596.06s -> 16601.16s]  Okay.
[16601.16s -> 16629.90s]  We need, I'm going to play from here.
[16629.90s -> 16633.02s]  Change his prop to something else, to a banana.
[16633.02s -> 16642.47s]  Is there, is there a way I can actually put a prop in here
[16642.47s -> 16644.95s]  without having to take from whatever they have?
[16644.95s -> 16649.90s]  Because this is the slot one.
[16649.90s -> 16652.06s]  So how do I, is there a way I can get a better list?
[16652.70s -> 16663.26s]  Apparently not.
[16663.26s -> 16666.52s]  Unless I can do something from another menu or something.
[16666.52s -> 16673.06s]  Static prop should be there, I guess.
[16673.06s -> 16673.70s]  I don't know why.
[16676.10s -> 16677.06s]  Strange.
[16677.06s -> 16681.53s]  All right.
[16681.53s -> 16682.57s]  I think this is good.
[16682.57s -> 16683.69s]  I'm going to use this.
[16684.49s -> 16686.49s]  We need to have just like a general soldier here though.
[16687.21s -> 16695.51s]  What is this haircut?
[16696.15s -> 16703.45s]  Why is he dressed like this?
[16710.46s -> 16710.70s]  All right.
[16710.70s -> 16711.34s]  It looks fine.
[16711.98s -> 16714.22s]  We just need this just a quick little like got you moment
[16714.22s -> 16717.75s]  where it's just like, bang, like right, like here.
[16717.75s -> 16730.52s]  Okay.
[16730.52s -> 16731.64s]  Let's go right there.
[16732.28s -> 16748.17s]  Maybe like there.
[16748.73s -> 16769.94s]  Okay.
[16769.94s -> 16777.54s]  So then like this, move the camera here.
[16783.21s -> 16784.65s]  That's like too much.
[16784.65s -> 16800.49s]  How is he, all right.
[16800.49s -> 16806.09s]  So then it should be there and then there.
[16806.09s -> 16808.09s]  Right at this right moment, like this.
[16808.09s -> 16814.17s]  Camera one, camera two.
[16814.17s -> 16818.31s]  I think that should be correct, right?
[16822.95s -> 16823.51s]  Yep.
[16823.51s -> 16824.78s]  So we'll edit it.
[16824.78s -> 16825.34s]  We'll have this.
[16825.98s -> 16831.85s]  Grab his head.
[16831.85s -> 16850.15s]  That second camera sucks, but it's fine because they're going to be bang.
[16850.15s -> 16856.20s]  Cut.
[16856.20s -> 16866.15s]  Let's have now like a battlefield, tropical jungle.
[16866.15s -> 16874.81s]  No, no, we're going to have like a war scene now on the, on a bridge, starship bridge.
[16875.37s -> 16883.64s]  Kill zombie.
[16884.20s -> 16888.20s]  No, that has to be like preparation here.
[16888.20s -> 16889.00s]  Fire staring.
[16889.00s -> 16890.28s]  Someone stares through the fire.
[16895.38s -> 16899.16s]  We need, let's take off stunts.
[16899.16s -> 16904.89s]  Let's just do violence.
[16904.89s -> 16905.85s]  Drink react.
[16905.85s -> 16906.73s]  Drink poison.
[16909.91s -> 16911.11s]  Explosion reaction.
[16913.85s -> 16915.45s]  Firing blanks.
[16915.45s -> 16921.74s]  Shooting dance.
[16922.30s -> 16927.48s]  Wait, what do you mean shooting dance?
[16942.14s -> 16943.82s]  How do you act professional here?
[16958.94s -> 16962.62s]  Okay, he's, he's doing the Carlton.
[16962.62s -> 16963.58s]  How, what is that?
[16963.58s -> 16964.22s]  Professional.
[17016.34s -> 17020.34s]  All right, this has to be somebody.
[17021.22s -> 17024.15s]  Now you're going to be in a different costume than this.
[17048.23s -> 17049.51s]  And this is going to be like an extra.
[17049.51s -> 17050.87s]  Like this is what they, this is what they do to humans.
[17050.87s -> 17052.31s]  They fucking like torture them.
[17058.63s -> 17059.83s]  What is this guy doing over here?
[17072.90s -> 17074.82s]  Torture by bullying people.
[17075.46s -> 17080.10s]  Okay, that's fine.
[17080.74s -> 17090.52s]  And then we need, yeah, I'm going to, don't worry.
[17090.52s -> 17092.84s]  I'll have a subtitle that says that.
[17096.68s -> 17098.28s]  Not actual gameplay.
[17110.71s -> 17121.91s]  I'm going to have him run through like eight different corridors like this.
[17122.55s -> 17134.42s]  Starship bridge one, same thing.
[17134.42s -> 17136.42s]  I just want explosion, explosion run.
[17154.49s -> 17155.29s]  Okay, that's fine.
[17156.09s -> 17157.18s]  What is this called?
[17158.46s -> 17160.70s]  This is called explosive run.
[17170.87s -> 17173.11s]  Come on, give me some more explosive runs.
[17177.74s -> 17181.06s]  Shit, I wanted to run through like five different corridors.
[17182.20s -> 17186.14s]  I guess I could just have him do the same one over and over again.
[17190.86s -> 17197.78s]  What is it?
[17197.78s -> 17200.62s]  Starship four, corridor five, maybe.
[17204.34s -> 17205.46s]  Bullet run, explode.
[17205.46s -> 17205.78s]  Here we go.
[17205.78s -> 17206.50s]  Here's another, there we go.
[17206.50s -> 17207.00s]  Perfect.
[17218.63s -> 17226.66s]  Okay, sci-fi corridor, corridor one, corridor.
[17226.66s -> 17229.94s]  He just goes, he's running around the whole entire fucking.
[17234.34s -> 17250.44s]  Is it the same one?
[17250.44s -> 17251.00s]  No.
[17255.61s -> 17257.13s]  Yeah, make him run through somewhere else.
[17258.17s -> 17260.17s]  Yeah, make him run through like a living room.
[17261.21s -> 17263.05s]  Is there like a sprint through a living room?
[17272.22s -> 17273.18s]  It's too short.
[17273.98s -> 17274.46s]  Hold on.
[17275.18s -> 17289.78s]  Location two, smiling.
[17302.60s -> 17319.67s]  Okay, all right.
[17319.67s -> 17334.92s]  Now we're back to the explosions.
[17334.92s -> 17345.93s]  Corridor four, corridor, no, no, no.
[17345.93s -> 17356.22s]  Back to corridor, should he just run by the stage with his own body on it?
[17356.22s -> 17357.50s]  All right, moving, what about car?
[17363.19s -> 17364.79s]  He's like just in the world.
[17364.79s -> 17366.73s]  All right, let's go, let's see what, can I do that?
[17367.37s -> 17374.90s]  Let's go to stage.
[17394.36s -> 17396.28s]  Why does, this doesn't make any sense.
[17401.13s -> 17408.76s]  Constant fucking conflict.
[17408.76s -> 17410.52s]  Yeah, and we're gonna have like an alien, like he,
[17410.52s -> 17412.52s]  this is, the trailer is behind him here.
[17412.52s -> 17417.48s]  You know what I mean?
[17417.48s -> 17423.67s]  Like this is, the trailer is behind him.
[17423.67s -> 17438.22s]  There's the spaceship.
[17438.22s -> 17439.26s]  All right, now we're gonna have,
[17439.26s -> 17449.85s]  well, okay, almost time for the trailer to be over.
[17449.85s -> 17451.69s]  Why would it zoom in on this?
[17456.42s -> 17458.42s]  Action, moderate, action, heavy.
[17458.90s -> 17461.78s]  Oh my, he's kicking the shit out of him.
[17467.40s -> 17468.60s]  Is it, what's after that?
[17468.60s -> 17475.22s]  There's extreme, from that reaction shot.
[17482.84s -> 17484.20s]  I don't understand that one.
[17487.82s -> 17489.58s]  He breaks his neck back again.
[17490.38s -> 17494.78s]  I think I like heavy because heavy, there's just more punches.
[17501.96s -> 17503.56s]  Okay, this also needs to be,
[17503.56s -> 17506.98s]  you're gonna be in a different costume here.
[17506.98s -> 17508.02s]  You're gonna be like one of the aliens.
[17509.86s -> 17511.46s]  Am I, am I fucking this whole thing up?
[17512.26s -> 17512.82s]  I might be.
[17520.25s -> 17539.24s]  I think it's Mysterio, far from home.
[17539.24s -> 17549.53s]  That's my favorite part, when he just like drops him.
[17550.87s -> 17552.79s]  Do you realize when he lands on this ground,
[17552.79s -> 17554.87s]  I'm gonna make a loud, awful thud.
[17555.59s -> 17558.63s]  Like crashes and glass breaking because of the head.
[17560.36s -> 17587.26s]  Just like, all right, okay.
[17587.26s -> 17589.18s]  The first trailer is almost over.
[17589.18s -> 17603.67s]  What is this?
[17608.15s -> 17611.05s]  Picnic, let's see, what do they got for stunts?
[17612.78s -> 17614.46s]  Horse riders shot?
[17614.46s -> 17617.22s]  What do you mean horse riders shot?
[17624.74s -> 17626.42s]  Why would there be a horse here?
[17627.06s -> 17634.01s]  What's location two?
[17634.81s -> 17641.38s]  I like location one better.
[17641.38s -> 17652.12s]  Okay, we got, that prop has to, no, no, no.
[17652.12s -> 17655.66s]  Lighting, this is fine.
[17655.66s -> 17661.54s]  Weather, wind, strong wind.
[17669.93s -> 17671.77s]  A bunch of trash.
[17676.22s -> 17677.98s]  That's so much trash.
[17685.86s -> 17687.78s]  What the shit did he plant it?
[17691.54s -> 17696.34s]  It's like plastic bags.
[17704.22s -> 17716.23s]  Well, this has to be, he's gotta be, oh my god.
[17732.41s -> 17733.85s]  This is so dirty.
[17735.21s -> 17742.30s]  Wait, wait, why does he fall twice?
[17749.58s -> 17753.90s]  Okay, looking good.
[17753.90s -> 17764.65s]  Let me just make sure that this shit's still looking okay.
[17764.65s -> 17773.19s]  There it is.
[17773.19s -> 17781.13s]  What happened to the camera here?
[17781.13s -> 17782.89s]  Didn't I make, didn't I change this?
[17790.09s -> 17791.29s]  I thought I had this changed.
[17791.29s -> 17798.25s]  That's weird.
[17798.25s -> 17802.25s]  It should be there, right?
[17802.25s -> 17803.69s]  All right, that's it for the trailer.
[17803.69s -> 17805.37s]  Now we're gonna go, let's go back to the stage
[17812.15s -> 17818.94s]  and we're introducing our new game.
[17818.94s -> 17820.86s]  There's two games to show at this E3.
[17820.86s -> 17833.43s]  Is it like medic or, hold on, I need,
[17835.66s -> 17843.06s]  we need loving or showing a card.
[17843.06s -> 17847.90s]  Resolution, take off pursuit and loving.
[17847.90s -> 17855.22s]  Resolution, okay, here we go.
[17855.22s -> 17873.53s]  And then we're gonna go to the next trail.
[17873.53s -> 17892.30s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, come here.
[17892.30s -> 17895.18s]  I'm gonna like record a dialogue of me being like,
[17895.18s -> 17897.74s]  this conference sucks.
[17897.74s -> 17898.78s]  Fuck your company.
[17904.07s -> 17909.72s]  All right, so new game, we'll fade into this one,
[17909.72s -> 17915.72s]  is gonna be, who am I gonna put in this?
[17918.97s -> 17927.93s]  Should it just be another conflict game?
[17927.93s -> 17932.07s]  It's the same one.
[17932.07s -> 17933.27s]  Make it western.
[17933.27s -> 17936.82s]  Saloon bedroom.
[17936.82s -> 17937.86s]  Make a dating sim.
[17941.69s -> 17942.89s]  Scrolling landscape.
[17943.69s -> 17944.81s]  Just like a driving game.
[17945.45s -> 17953.06s]  Yeah, a driving game.
[17953.06s -> 17955.46s]  And don't worry, there'll be constant conflict in this game.
[17957.30s -> 17965.43s]  Street, okay, vehicle, car.
[17975.06s -> 17977.62s]  He's not gonna star in his own game again.
[17977.62s -> 17994.07s]  Mood, what?
[17994.07s -> 18005.03s]  Why would you wait that long to detonate a car bomb?
[18008.41s -> 18011.13s]  Wouldn't it explode way before?
[18019.67s -> 18021.83s]  That's the conflict.
[18021.83s -> 18023.11s]  Why wouldn't it, why?
[18034.23s -> 18035.59s]  All right, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[18035.59s -> 18051.88s]  We're going, there's just no clothes on.
[18051.88s -> 18052.92s]  He's just like naked.
[18059.53s -> 18060.97s]  Uh, what do we want?
[18060.97s -> 18065.64s]  No, this is a driving game.
[18065.64s -> 18080.10s]  There can't be this much constant conflict.
[18080.10s -> 18080.90s]  How do you sneak?
[18099.30s -> 18100.50s]  What was that?
[18100.50s -> 18101.22s]  Ice cream.
[18104.44s -> 18108.76s]  City street.
[18108.76s -> 18109.88s]  All right, this is the driving.
[18109.88s -> 18112.63s]  I need to do a driving game.
[18112.63s -> 18126.10s]  I can't just let it go off the rails.
[18126.10s -> 18135.88s]  Car burnout.
[18135.88s -> 18149.10s]  All right, that's a pretty good start.
[18149.10s -> 18150.46s]  Not a taxi though.
[18150.46s -> 18152.62s]  If it's a driving game, it needs to be something cool.
[18152.62s -> 18156.82s]  All right, this is pretty nice.
[18162.89s -> 18165.13s]  He's got to be in different, not different clothes.
[18165.69s -> 18173.18s]  What was he in?
[18173.18s -> 18174.78s]  Yeah, no, this is fine.
[18174.78s -> 18175.34s]  Right here.
[18175.34s -> 18198.87s]  All right, that looks good.
[18198.87s -> 18200.33s]  It's a good start.
[18200.33s -> 18202.57s]  That's going to go, okay, same thing.
[18202.57s -> 18203.61s]  Urban city street.
[18203.61s -> 18209.37s]  It's more like peeling out and cool shit.
[18209.37s -> 18210.01s]  Car squeeze.
[18210.01s -> 18210.41s]  What's that?
[18210.41s -> 18211.70s]  Car squeeze?
[18211.70s -> 18213.62s]  Lots of people comically squeeze into a car.
[18215.99s -> 18218.31s]  Just, just get it out of the way immediately.
[18224.46s -> 18225.82s]  Should I just get it out of the way?
[18225.82s -> 18226.86s]  Should I get it out of the way?
[18230.31s -> 18235.11s]  Should we fill the car with clowns and then just have them get in it?
[18235.11s -> 18237.03s]  No, it can't be like this already.
[18258.55s -> 18259.83s]  Does he have different hair?
[18260.47s -> 18274.84s]  Don't worry.
[18274.84s -> 18275.56s]  I'll get it.
[18275.56s -> 18277.16s]  I'll, we'll get the call back.
[18277.16s -> 18277.64s]  Don't worry.
[18277.64s -> 18278.44s]  Here's the call back.
[18279.16s -> 18294.47s]  It's never not funny.
[18294.47s -> 18295.03s]  It's not.
[18295.75s -> 18296.87s]  It's never not fun.
[18296.87s -> 18299.29s]  It's never not funny.
[18299.29s -> 18300.97s]  Constant fucking conflict.
[18303.54s -> 18305.62s]  We need to, I need to be able to edit this together though.
[18307.50s -> 18307.98s]  Hold on.
[18310.01s -> 18310.73s]  Some driving.
[18312.09s -> 18315.70s]  Where's the clown?
[18315.70s -> 18317.06s]  Like comical clown one.
[18322.17s -> 18322.97s]  Car squeeze.
[18343.19s -> 18344.71s]  It's a normal.
[18344.71s -> 18345.03s]  Okay.
[18346.62s -> 18347.58s]  Oh Jesus.
[18384.57s -> 18384.89s]  Okay.
[18384.89s -> 18387.16s]  Close the door.
[18387.16s -> 18390.87s]  But I think I need to put, hold on.
[18390.87s -> 18394.26s]  It's the same people that were in the last game.
[18394.26s -> 18405.54s]  I need a fucking clown costume.
[18405.54s -> 18412.10s]  Is it a monster?
[18416.58s -> 18417.06s]  Premium.
[18429.77s -> 18430.33s]  Where is it?
[18447.16s -> 18448.84s]  There are so many costumes.
[18448.84s -> 18450.12s]  Can I just type in clown?
[18457.35s -> 18458.23s]  Where's the clown?
[18458.23s -> 18459.03s]  Where's the clown?
[18459.03s -> 18459.75s]  Where's the clown?
[18459.75s -> 18460.47s]  Where's the clown?
[18461.03s -> 18466.90s]  Okay, I found it.
[18466.90s -> 18479.06s]  Okay.
[18479.06s -> 18482.74s]  There we go.
[18482.74s -> 18495.06s]  So here comes the one clown.
[18495.06s -> 18497.22s]  Everyone is just going to be in the same clown costume.
[18508.10s -> 18510.18s]  I got to get like a good, where is it?
[18510.18s -> 18513.35s]  What would it actually be under?
[18513.35s -> 18514.39s]  Not casual, right?
[18515.03s -> 18524.41s]  Formal work.
[18524.41s -> 18546.15s]  So only like a few people need to be in clown costumes.
[18546.15s -> 18554.17s]  All of them.
[18554.17s -> 18556.09s]  What does this have to do with the game?
[18556.09s -> 18578.60s]  I don't think I can even make these other extras
[18578.60s -> 18580.94s]  because I don't have them set as anybody.
[18580.94s -> 18604.06s]  Okay.
[18604.14s -> 18606.84s]  One, two, three, four.
[18612.42s -> 18616.54s]  Wait, is it going to be this?
[18616.54s -> 18619.66s]  No, it's not going to work.
[18619.66s -> 18638.33s]  I don't have enough extras.
[18638.33s -> 18639.85s]  Is there no clown costume?
[18639.85s -> 18655.74s]  Hold on.
[18655.74s -> 18656.38s]  Why?
[18656.38s -> 18661.99s]  I can't have a woman in a clown costume?
[18661.99s -> 18664.62s]  That seems to make no sense.
[18672.81s -> 18679.30s]  Uh, I mean, I don't know.
[18679.30s -> 18680.66s]  There has to be a clown.
[18689.56s -> 18705.70s]  Uh, I guess I don't.
[18705.70s -> 18710.60s]  Wait, hold on.
[18710.60s -> 18737.99s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[18737.99s -> 18746.25s]  What if it's just some of them just regular people?
[18746.25s -> 18748.63s]  I can fix this later.
[18748.63s -> 18752.33s]  Um, all right.
[18753.21s -> 18754.81s]  First of all, this needs to be changed.
[18775.02s -> 18776.62s]  It's like I have a different hair.
[18776.62s -> 18778.78s]  I mean, see?
[18783.99s -> 18784.63s]  Okay.
[18784.63s -> 18789.02s]  I also, okay, urban office.
[18789.02s -> 18789.74s]  No, no, no.
[18789.74s -> 18792.94s]  Miniature city.
[18792.94s -> 18793.98s]  Cars race.
[18793.98s -> 18794.70s]  Here we go.
[18795.26s -> 18798.30s]  Perfect.
[18798.30s -> 18801.02s]  Oh, look at this.
[18801.02s -> 18802.86s]  This is exactly what I wanted.
[18802.86s -> 18829.85s]  Where's the car I was already using?
[18829.85s -> 18830.97s]  EMT.
[18830.97s -> 18831.21s]  All right.
[18831.21s -> 18833.66s]  That looks good.
[18833.66s -> 18833.98s]  Okay.
[18836.01s -> 18836.41s]  Same thing.
[18836.41s -> 18843.27s]  Let's do the miniature city again.
[18843.27s -> 18844.47s]  Car skid.
[18844.47s -> 18848.62s]  Cars race.
[18848.62s -> 18849.50s]  Car traffic.
[18852.01s -> 18854.25s]  City, city explosion.
[18858.60s -> 18859.40s]  Establish the city.
[18859.40s -> 18860.92s]  We could do like a pull it back.
[18861.94s -> 18863.06s]  Tracking show off to the city.
[18863.06s -> 18863.86s]  That sounds pretty good.
[18873.43s -> 18873.91s]  Forwards.
[18874.55s -> 18875.35s]  Perspective two.
[18876.07s -> 18876.87s]  There we go.
[18876.87s -> 18877.11s]  Nice.
[18885.90s -> 18886.78s]  And the speed up.
[18887.90s -> 18893.61s]  And then let's do inside the car.
[18894.25s -> 18903.66s]  What stunts have we got?
[18903.66s -> 18904.30s]  Car chase.
[18905.62s -> 18906.58s]  Car chase rear.
[18909.75s -> 18910.55s]  Gear change.
[18910.55s -> 18911.27s]  Dashboard.
[18914.52s -> 18916.44s]  Radio, radio answer.
[18918.78s -> 18920.90s]  Car sudden stop.
[18920.90s -> 18930.18s]  Let's see what this looks like.
[18930.18s -> 18930.82s]  Turning.
[18930.82s -> 18931.30s]  Braking.
[18938.06s -> 18939.34s]  You've done that before.
[18939.34s -> 18948.41s]  All right.
[18948.41s -> 18956.54s]  Who the fuck was even in the car?
[18956.54s -> 18957.26s]  Which one was it?
[18957.26s -> 18958.30s]  It was this one.
[18958.30s -> 18958.86s]  No, it wasn't.
[18960.76s -> 18961.88s]  It was like a nice car.
[18961.88s -> 18962.52s]  Like this one.
[18962.52s -> 18964.97s]  This one right here.
[18964.97s -> 18966.49s]  And I have no idea who was in the car.
[18967.64s -> 18967.96s]  Oh yeah.
[18967.96s -> 18969.00s]  There was like a bunch of clowns.
[18969.72s -> 18972.07s]  All right.
[18972.07s -> 18973.91s]  Before this derails completely.
[18974.55s -> 18980.06s]  I think it was you.
[18980.06s -> 18980.70s]  No, it was you.
[18999.69s -> 19000.73s]  Like it hasn't already.
[19000.73s -> 19001.85s]  Well, not completely.
[19002.65s -> 19005.58s]  Okay.
[19006.22s -> 19008.70s]  So there's a big break.
[19008.70s -> 19015.35s]  This is going to take a fucking ton of editing.
[19015.35s -> 19016.23s]  But it's going to be worth it.
[19016.87s -> 19023.80s]  City block corridor.
[19023.80s -> 19030.25s]  Nature city again.
[19039.74s -> 19041.54s]  Car traffic.
[19052.78s -> 19054.14s]  There's no other.
[19054.14s -> 19054.94s]  This is the only one.
[19056.90s -> 19058.66s]  I wonder whose car this is supposed to be.
[19067.29s -> 19088.33s]  Let's go into the camera.
[19088.33s -> 19088.97s]  Oh, easy.
[19089.29s -> 19111.18s]  I want a good view of this.
[19111.18s -> 19118.87s]  Too much movement.
[19123.56s -> 19139.35s]  All right.
[19139.35s -> 19140.23s]  Let's start here.
[19140.23s -> 19141.51s]  And then I'm going to go in.
[19141.51s -> 19145.02s]  Why are they not moving?
[19145.02s -> 19148.57s]  Oh God.
[19148.57s -> 19149.93s]  They're like little set pieces.
[19149.93s -> 19150.73s]  That's why.
[19150.73s -> 19165.50s]  Where is it all the way down there?
[19171.26s -> 19172.46s]  Cars are like little bugs.
[19172.46s -> 19174.14s]  I actually just like the static right here.
[19180.94s -> 19181.66s]  This is parked.
[19188.14s -> 19188.38s]  All right.
[19188.38s -> 19190.30s]  And then finally we're going to have.
[19190.30s -> 19199.18s]  Let's go back to the street.
[19199.18s -> 19202.28s]  Car parking.
[19202.28s -> 19203.48s]  Exit car collapse.
[19218.06s -> 19218.46s]  All right.
[19219.72s -> 19228.30s]  Let's have it.
[19228.30s -> 19229.90s]  I guess we'll keep the clown theme here.
[19240.07s -> 19243.51s]  Needs to be the right car, which I mean.
[19243.51s -> 19246.36s]  This is as close as I can get it, I think.
[19246.36s -> 19247.24s]  I can get it.
[19247.24s -> 19258.90s]  Okay.
[19258.90s -> 19261.72s]  And then last.
[19262.60s -> 19264.04s]  This is going to be long.
[19264.04s -> 19265.08s]  It's it'll be worth it.
[19265.08s -> 19276.39s]  It'd be worth it.
[19276.39s -> 19277.43s]  Last thing.
[19277.43s -> 19284.74s]  Car jump.
[19284.74s -> 19293.78s]  Car crashes around a corner and slides onto its roof under attack.
[19302.97s -> 19303.93s]  He's got to drive through.
[19304.65s -> 19308.39s]  He's going to be driving through when it explodes.
[19308.39s -> 19315.40s]  Can I make this look a little?
[19315.40s -> 19316.60s]  Like a spaceship car?
[19316.60s -> 19323.38s]  This is going in the other scene.
[19323.38s -> 19333.29s]  This is in the other game.
[19333.29s -> 19342.01s]  This is going back.
[19342.01s -> 19342.49s]  All right.
[19342.49s -> 19351.93s]  And finally, we're not going to use all these clips.
[19351.93s -> 19353.29s]  I just want to make sure I have them.
[19353.29s -> 19362.47s]  I need just like driving.
[19362.47s -> 19367.50s]  Here we go.
[19367.50s -> 19382.34s]  It's a very slow drive, but it'll work.
[19382.34s -> 19389.02s]  Just aliens.
[19401.00s -> 19401.80s]  This is the intro.
[19402.52s -> 19405.24s]  This is where it says not gameplay footage.
[19405.24s -> 19422.82s]  Okay.
[19423.46s -> 19427.88s]  I don't know what that's about.
[19429.05s -> 19431.22s]  Okay.
[19431.22s -> 19432.82s]  We've got enough there.
[19432.82s -> 19438.71s]  It's time to bring it back to the stage and wrap up the E3 presentation.
[19467.19s -> 19472.26s]  And then let's go back here.
[19473.38s -> 19474.34s]  That's fine.
[19474.34s -> 19477.24s]  Now we need somebody else to come out and just say goodbye.
[19477.24s -> 19512.87s]  Put the camera back over this way.
[19512.87s -> 19521.94s]  That's fine.
[19521.94s -> 19522.42s]  Right there.
[19528.86s -> 19529.66s]  All right.
[19529.66s -> 19538.98s]  And then we need stage again.
[19555.37s -> 19556.01s]  Different hair.
[19569.06s -> 19569.38s]  Hair.
[19571.66s -> 19572.38s]  How do I?
[19572.38s -> 19572.54s]  Okay.
[19572.54s -> 19573.42s]  I got to make it.
[19573.42s -> 19575.26s]  I'm just going to make this the person, I guess.
[19576.39s -> 19592.98s]  Does he come on and change on stage?
[19592.98s -> 19603.03s]  What the hell was it called again?
[19604.54s -> 19610.63s]  There it is.
[19610.63s -> 19611.27s]  All right.
[19611.27s -> 19611.51s]  Done.
[19622.01s -> 19629.54s]  I'm not even going to dub over this.
[19631.38s -> 19650.34s]  And let's like, hold on.
[19650.34s -> 19650.98s]  I want to do something.
[19650.98s -> 19651.78s]  I want one more thing.
[19655.88s -> 19656.52s]  Let me just see.
[19657.08s -> 19671.86s]  I want somebody just on the computer.
[19672.58s -> 19674.58s]  Like at the desk or a computer.
[19681.98s -> 19694.31s]  Computer hacking.
[19697.43s -> 19703.69s]  The gorilla hacking, the gorilla watching E3.
[19708.22s -> 19708.70s]  Yeah.
[19708.70s -> 19711.50s]  And writing a bunch of mean shit on like Reddit.
[19711.58s -> 19713.50s]  He's really pissed off about what he just saw.
[19720.78s -> 19723.26s]  I can't fucking believe what they showed here.
[19723.26s -> 19728.60s]  You know, I really was, look, I was hoping for Yoshi's Bully World 2.
[19733.59s -> 19733.75s]  Yeah.
[19733.75s -> 19734.71s]  He's on Reddit.
[19734.71s -> 19745.18s]  All right.
[19745.18s -> 19753.06s]  So we need to have, does this just be a lizard?
[19757.22s -> 19758.82s]  Search bar Reddit.
[19758.82s -> 19759.54s]  Yeah.
[19759.54s -> 19760.18s]  We'll put it in.
[19791.93s -> 19797.69s]  They didn't announce his favorite game.
[19797.69s -> 19802.90s]  Oh, there you go.
[19802.90s -> 19809.32s]  Miss E3 sucked.
[19809.32s -> 19809.72s]  All right.
[19809.72s -> 19820.44s]  Now it's my job to put this all together.
[19820.44s -> 19820.68s]  Yeah.
[19820.68s -> 19822.60s]  I'll make sure there's a lot of extras.
[19823.98s -> 19825.58s]  So that, this should be good.
[19825.58s -> 19828.04s]  I don't think there's anything else.
[19828.04s -> 19833.80s]  I'm pretty sure I have every scene I need.
[19833.80s -> 19843.00s]  I think.
[19843.00s -> 19845.24s]  I believe it's time to go back.
[19846.86s -> 19847.42s]  Confirm.
[19850.36s -> 19850.76s]  Save it.
[19850.76s -> 19851.32s]  I will.
[19851.32s -> 19851.64s]  I will.
[19851.64s -> 19852.28s]  Don't worry.
[19852.28s -> 19854.84s]  Don't worry.
[19854.84s -> 19855.08s]  Save.
[19855.80s -> 19857.96s]  I have to like confirm an exit before I can save.
[19860.14s -> 19862.46s]  Did I miss a backdrop somewhere?
[19862.46s -> 19864.38s]  Maybe I did, but whatever.
[19864.38s -> 19867.34s]  Here we go.
[19874.62s -> 19875.82s]  It is ready for casting.
[19876.70s -> 19880.68s]  I'm going to save the game.
[19884.38s -> 19888.76s]  Let's just call this one P Pants 2.
[19890.04s -> 19890.44s]  All right.
[19892.42s -> 19894.82s]  So let's get this in the, let's get some extras.
[19895.62s -> 19902.12s]  I need to go to the, where the hiring is.
[19904.87s -> 19906.47s]  Create, I need crew, right?
[19909.62s -> 19910.66s]  I need extras.
[19911.22s -> 19917.75s]  Does that matter?
[19918.31s -> 19920.55s]  Or will it fill it automatically?
[19921.11s -> 19927.18s]  I guess we'll find out.
[19927.18s -> 19928.46s]  Because I can't drag them over here.
[19928.46s -> 19931.85s]  I need to cast to start getting extras.
[19931.85s -> 19932.17s]  Okay.
[19933.21s -> 19933.45s]  All right.
[19933.45s -> 19933.93s]  Let's do it.
[19937.14s -> 19938.50s]  Begin casting.
[19941.21s -> 19941.61s]  Extras.
[19941.61s -> 19943.29s]  I need 11 extras.
[19949.05s -> 19951.13s]  Can I even have this many people?
[19951.13s -> 19958.07s]  How do I get extras?
[19967.66s -> 19968.70s]  I need more crew.
[19974.23s -> 19977.11s]  Now I need extras, but I can't pull these guys into extras.
[19978.15s -> 19978.95s]  Just birth them.
[19979.67s -> 19991.43s]  I need, I need a director.
[19991.43s -> 19992.23s]  Well, I have one here.
[19993.11s -> 19997.70s]  And now I need the extras.
[20000.28s -> 20002.04s]  Don't they usually hang out in front of here?
[20014.10s -> 20018.58s]  Because there's somebody here.
[20019.22s -> 20020.66s]  But I can't add them to extras.
[20020.66s -> 20020.82s]  Why?
[20024.22s -> 20026.46s]  I have to go to the stage school to create extras.
[20026.46s -> 20027.66s]  Where the hell is that one?
[20028.54s -> 20032.41s]  They hang out in front of one of the buildings.
[20033.69s -> 20034.57s]  Stunt school.
[20035.29s -> 20036.73s]  I think I'm going to need some stuntmen.
[20039.61s -> 20041.61s]  I need a stunt, I need stunt doubles.
[20041.61s -> 20052.28s]  Okay.
[20052.84s -> 20056.81s]  What about over here?
[20057.85s -> 20059.69s]  Oh, here we go.
[20061.75s -> 20062.87s]  Stars and studios.
[20062.87s -> 20063.43s]  Reject.
[20064.15s -> 20064.87s]  Movie making?
[20064.87s -> 20065.11s]  No.
[20065.75s -> 20067.77s]  What are these people?
[20067.77s -> 20074.57s]  I mean, these people are just hanging out here.
[20078.52s -> 20080.20s]  Import, start, create, extra.
[20081.00s -> 20089.64s]  I need more.
[20094.79s -> 20095.91s]  I'm working on it.
[20106.14s -> 20113.58s]  We good?
[20114.70s -> 20116.22s]  I need one more extra.
[20117.02s -> 20119.96s]  I have enough stuntmen, right?
[20120.60s -> 20122.41s]  I should, don't I?
[20123.13s -> 20127.13s]  I need one more extra.
[20127.93s -> 20129.78s]  I need sci-fi corridor.
[20129.78s -> 20131.94s]  Actor does not, does own stunts.
[20131.94s -> 20133.14s]  Actor does own stunts.
[20133.78s -> 20134.82s]  Oh, okay, that's fine.
[20135.54s -> 20140.20s]  All right, I need sci-fi corridor one and two.
[20143.53s -> 20145.70s]  Let me save this.
[20146.26s -> 20152.81s]  I still need one more person.
[20154.90s -> 20156.10s]  What about one of the janitors?
[20156.10s -> 20157.62s]  I'm just gonna make one of the janitors an extra.
[20158.34s -> 20159.62s]  Well, there's a lot of people here.
[20162.20s -> 20162.68s]  That's it.
[20163.32s -> 20164.76s]  Now we need the sets.
[20165.48s -> 20166.68s]  Sci-fi corridor one and two.
[20172.22s -> 20174.94s]  Sci-fi corridor one and two.
[20175.66s -> 20182.90s]  That it?
[20183.86s -> 20184.82s]  I think it's ready to go.
[20186.09s -> 20188.41s]  Suburban living room one and alien world.
[20189.21s -> 20194.89s]  What happens in alien world?
[20201.83s -> 20202.31s]  There it is.
[20206.04s -> 20207.32s]  Spartan torture?
[20209.62s -> 20210.42s]  What is that for?
[20216.18s -> 20216.66s]  What else?
[20219.06s -> 20220.42s]  Suburban street.
[20220.42s -> 20222.42s]  Oh man, am I gonna have enough room for this shit?
[20223.22s -> 20223.94s]  I might not.
[20224.90s -> 20231.96s]  This is, this is huge.
[20234.42s -> 20235.86s]  I'm gonna have to move some stuff around.
[20236.42s -> 20236.90s]  I got it.
[20238.58s -> 20239.06s]  And then...
[20240.10s -> 20241.06s]  That it?
[20242.02s -> 20242.50s]  Here we go.
[20246.76s -> 20249.29s]  It's time to shoot it.
[20249.85s -> 20253.90s]  What's wrong?
[20253.90s -> 20254.94s]  You don't, you don't feel good?
[20255.90s -> 20257.02s]  Jax, you don't feel good, Jax?
[20260.60s -> 20261.40s]  Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean?
[20261.40s -> 20261.96s]  Wait, wait?
[20271.58s -> 20272.70s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait?
[20273.34s -> 20275.08s]  Get stunt doubles?
[20275.64s -> 20277.00s]  It says they're gonna do their own stunts.
[20280.07s -> 20281.27s]  Oh, you're talking about the music.
[20284.87s -> 20286.55s]  That's what you're wearing you want me to wait for.
[20286.55s -> 20286.87s]  I see.
[20287.51s -> 20290.17s]  I'm gonna save it.
[20290.17s -> 20290.73s]  Let's shoot it.
[20297.46s -> 20297.94s]  Here we go.
[20315.67s -> 20316.23s]  And...
[20316.79s -> 20318.26s]  It's one star.
[20325.27s -> 20325.75s]  Is it done?
[20328.31s -> 20329.67s]  I got instant filming here, man.
[20331.91s -> 20337.61s]  I actually think it's loading it up yet.
[20340.94s -> 20341.18s]  Okay.
[20341.82s -> 20344.71s]  Post production.
[20344.71s -> 20346.31s]  This is KNBS.
[20346.31s -> 20351.96s]  I'm Kristen, the girl who puts the womb in woman.
[20351.96s -> 20353.48s]  Post production.
[20353.48s -> 20363.82s]  I need to make sure I can do this.
[20363.82s -> 20364.94s]  I'm gonna have to restart the game.
[20364.94s -> 20366.62s]  So let me just see what happens when I do this.
[20367.26s -> 20372.55s]  I need to be able to record dialogue.
[20376.82s -> 20377.46s]  Is there...
[20377.46s -> 20378.10s]  Can I not?
[20378.74s -> 20381.51s]  Wasn't there something weird I had to do last time for this?
[20387.91s -> 20388.31s]  Hello.
[20389.40s -> 20389.88s]  Testing.
[20390.44s -> 20398.54s]  Testing.
[20398.54s -> 20400.84s]  It works.
[20400.84s -> 20401.80s]  It's really low though.
[20402.44s -> 20413.13s]  How do I get rid of this?
[20413.13s -> 20418.87s]  Oh, there we go.
[20418.87s -> 20421.19s]  So we are gonna change the title here.
[20421.19s -> 20422.63s]  This is the, this is the big movie.
[20423.27s -> 20435.75s]  Crap.
[20435.75s -> 20438.12s]  Why does it look like this?
[20438.12s -> 20453.34s]  Yeah, this looks like wicked frosty.
[20453.34s -> 20458.76s]  All right.
[20458.76s -> 20464.70s]  First of all, it's not going to be acid bass.
[20464.70s -> 20472.15s]  Following motion picture E3 presentation.
[20472.15s -> 20474.71s]  E presents liquidated production.
[20474.71s -> 20478.73s]  E3 presentation.
[20478.73s -> 20478.97s]  Okay.
[20478.97s -> 20480.81s]  We need applause.
[20480.81s -> 20484.68s]  Let's get the music track on here.
[20484.68s -> 20493.77s]  We need orchestral.
[20493.77s -> 20494.89s]  This might be good.
[20494.89s -> 20519.94s]  All right.
[20519.94s -> 20522.66s]  Well, I'm going to turn off like the mumbling.
[20532.28s -> 20534.60s]  I don't like it.
[20534.60s -> 20535.40s]  Alleyway groove.
[20542.79s -> 20543.51s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20543.51s -> 20544.55s]  Trim before adding the sound.
[20544.55s -> 20544.71s]  Okay.
[20544.71s -> 20546.31s]  So now this is fine.
[20549.26s -> 20562.94s]  I'll put the, I'll do the dialogue on this one.
[20562.94s -> 20565.42s]  Because I have to figure out how long I'm going to talk here.
[20565.98s -> 20576.31s]  Hello and welcome to OhMyGod24's 24th E3.
[20576.31s -> 20580.63s]  As you know that our OhMyGod starts with all of our initials.
[20582.34s -> 20587.46s]  Oswald, Manny, and Greg started this company back, you know, in 19...
[20592.30s -> 20593.66s]  Wait a minute.
[20593.66s -> 20594.22s]  Wait a minute.
[20594.22s -> 20594.78s]  Wait a minute.
[20596.22s -> 20596.62s]  That's...
[20597.66s -> 20598.22s]  That was...
[20608.74s -> 20613.06s]  It's the same fucking lady kissing herself.
[20614.54s -> 20618.14s]  It's the same lady, like, four times.
[20628.44s -> 20629.48s]  Who runs all this...
[20637.67s -> 20637.99s]  How?
[20656.26s -> 20658.02s]  This goes off of way too long, too.
[20659.51s -> 20659.83s]  All right.
[20659.83s -> 20660.55s]  Let me edit this.
[20667.10s -> 20669.37s]  So the CPR goes on.
[20669.37s -> 20671.61s]  I know the CPR is going on for way too long.
[20671.61s -> 20675.00s]  Comes over.
[20675.00s -> 20675.64s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[20675.64s -> 20676.20s]  Get over here.
[20680.14s -> 20682.38s]  The CPR, first of all, needs to be in a different place.
[20687.61s -> 20688.73s]  This is definitely the opener.
[20696.90s -> 20697.22s]  Okay.
[20699.11s -> 20700.63s]  Let's say this is fine.
[20700.63s -> 20702.63s]  I'll do a little bit of a voiceover on this.
[20706.98s -> 20708.02s]  We'll cut it here.
[20709.19s -> 20709.83s]  Delete this.
[20713.40s -> 20714.52s]  My fucking head hurts.
[20716.23s -> 20717.99s]  And then this part, this is the one here.
[20717.99s -> 20719.43s]  I want to cut trim here.
[20719.43s -> 20720.39s]  Wait, let's just make sure.
[20721.19s -> 20728.58s]  Yeah, that looks good.
[20735.61s -> 20741.22s]  Yeah.
[20741.22s -> 20742.02s]  All right.
[20742.02s -> 20748.46s]  We'll stop it there.
[20749.62s -> 20749.86s]  Right...
[20750.74s -> 20751.54s]  Like right here.
[20759.96s -> 20761.64s]  The person kissing themself.
[20762.86s -> 20763.66s]  What the hell is this?
[20766.15s -> 20766.55s]  Wait, wait.
[20766.55s -> 20767.11s]  Why is it...
[20767.11s -> 20768.07s]  I thought it was a person.
[20768.07s -> 20769.19s]  Is it another alien?
[20769.19s -> 20769.99s]  They're just playing.
[20789.90s -> 20790.22s]  Okay.
[20797.50s -> 20799.58s]  That happens way too fast.
[20804.09s -> 20804.65s]  Where are the...
[20804.65s -> 20805.93s]  What's wrong with the tires?
[20807.59s -> 20808.31s]  I need to go get...
[20808.87s -> 20812.71s]  I need to go get this.
[20812.71s -> 20813.75s]  I know that one of these clips...
[20816.06s -> 20816.62s]  This one here.
[20833.03s -> 20833.75s]  This...
[20833.75s -> 20845.03s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[20845.03s -> 20849.48s]  Back up over here.
[20849.48s -> 20851.00s]  This dance shit.
[20851.00s -> 20867.13s]  I don't need to trim that here
[20867.13s -> 20877.94s]  because I just want the part where he's driving forward.
[20877.94s -> 20879.22s]  Maybe even a little less.
[20879.22s -> 20882.09s]  Like right here.
[20882.09s -> 20882.89s]  One more notch.
[20882.89s -> 20883.93s]  One more knot right here.
[20883.93s -> 20894.06s]  And then right there.
[20894.06s -> 20894.78s]  Forward.
[20894.78s -> 20905.03s]  So this is the only one that I want to keep.
[20905.03s -> 20909.75s]  Now the question is, should this appear before he runs across the stage?
[20909.75s -> 20911.99s]  Let's take a look.
[20924.50s -> 20934.63s]  We gotta add the explosion in.
[20934.63s -> 20948.01s]  Let's try it over here.
[20948.01s -> 20950.65s]  Yeah, I gotta move the living room as well.
[20950.65s -> 20959.75s]  Let's check this.
[20973.78s -> 20985.58s]  I'm still gonna have an explosion there too.
[20985.58s -> 20989.03s]  I'm gonna put an explosion here, like two of them here.
[20989.03s -> 20989.75s]  Sounds.
[20989.75s -> 21001.42s]  Come on, pull it.
[21001.42s -> 21002.60s]  How does this look?
[21025.48s -> 21026.44s]  All right, that's good.
[21031.10s -> 21041.34s]  Okay, hold on.
[21041.34s -> 21041.98s]  Pull this back.
[21046.62s -> 21047.82s]  Boom, boom, boom.
[21047.82s -> 21063.13s]  The fucking part with the horse and the trash everywhere.
[21063.13s -> 21068.62s]  All right, that has to be explosion, or it sounds like that.
[21068.62s -> 21070.54s]  That actually kind of works pretty well.
[21070.54s -> 21072.14s]  That works pretty well.
[21085.21s -> 21087.37s]  These are all out of order completely.
[21087.37s -> 21088.33s]  I gotta fix these.
[21105.78s -> 21109.51s]  Here's the end.
[21110.23s -> 21113.64s]  So we're gonna start with this.
[21114.36s -> 21119.35s]  Put this over here.
[21119.35s -> 21121.59s]  Because this is like the intro to the second game.
[21122.23s -> 21128.07s]  This is like the knot in the lady.
[21128.07s -> 21128.79s]  She's everywhere.
[21133.75s -> 21137.75s]  And then we gotta get the clowns.
[21142.78s -> 21143.66s]  The car squeeze.
[21146.84s -> 21149.00s]  I don't know what happens here because there's just extras.
[21154.10s -> 21155.94s]  It's gonna be four or five clowns and then all extras.
[21170.66s -> 21173.54s]  They all get in again in different clothes.
[21177.78s -> 21179.06s]  That person got in twice.
[21179.70s -> 21186.28s]  It's just less clothes.
[21188.50s -> 21190.66s]  You just keep removing clothes.
[21211.99s -> 21212.71s]  God damn it.
[21213.59s -> 21216.20s]  Come over here.
[21216.84s -> 21222.82s]  Are they even in the right car?
[21228.34s -> 21229.06s]  Why is this?
[21229.06s -> 21230.90s]  This clip doesn't match.
[21230.90s -> 21231.54s]  It does not.
[21231.54s -> 21232.34s]  I have to delete this.
[21240.25s -> 21241.53s]  I don't think it goes anywhere.
[21241.53s -> 21252.68s]  No, that's bad.
[21252.68s -> 21253.24s]  This goes first.
[21253.24s -> 21253.80s]  This goes first.
[21254.52s -> 21262.34s]  Clearly, clearly only one old grandma in that car.
[21271.85s -> 21273.29s]  Right here.
[21279.66s -> 21281.66s]  It shows the constant conflict.
[21281.66s -> 21282.46s]  That, you know, you're right.
[21283.56s -> 21290.38s]  It does show that.
[21290.38s -> 21291.90s]  But I need, where's that other one?
[21292.63s -> 21293.43s]  I'll write this too.
[21293.43s -> 21296.89s]  This right here, right here.
[21296.89s -> 21297.77s]  We start with this.
[21305.06s -> 21308.78s]  And then it comes through here with some music.
[21311.26s -> 21312.62s]  Maybe a little bit shorter than that.
[21312.62s -> 21313.66s]  Doesn't need to be that long.
[21314.30s -> 21315.58s]  No in-game footage.
[21315.58s -> 21317.10s]  They both are gonna say it.
[21317.10s -> 21319.45s]  We'll go with like here.
[21323.42s -> 21329.67s]  All right, that's fine.
[21329.67s -> 21330.63s]  Everybody gets in the car.
[21339.96s -> 21341.48s]  I hate how long this is.
[21353.51s -> 21355.99s]  While they all get in, they peel out.
[21355.99s -> 21364.41s]  Let's see how this transitions together.
[21364.41s -> 21366.41s]  Intense music flying around through the city.
[21368.44s -> 21370.92s]  I'm gonna put like loud sounds.
[21371.64s -> 21376.86s]  Here's that car traffic one where there's a couple of accidents.
[21376.86s -> 21377.90s]  Him stepping on the brake.
[21378.46s -> 21382.54s]  No, no, no, no.
[21382.54s -> 21383.10s]  Get over here.
[21383.10s -> 21394.68s]  Let's try this.
[21396.82s -> 21398.34s]  Clown car battle royale.
[21411.43s -> 21412.79s]  Wrong one, wrong one, wrong one.
[21412.79s -> 21413.75s]  It's gotta be this way.
[21413.75s -> 21419.16s]  Okay.
[21428.57s -> 21429.61s]  That's so delayed.
[21429.61s -> 21430.57s]  But where does he stop?
[21430.57s -> 21431.29s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[21431.29s -> 21445.72s]  Wait.
[21445.72s -> 21460.78s]  He should stop peeling out here.
[21460.78s -> 21462.14s]  But he's no, he's still going.
[21471.30s -> 21474.02s]  No, he's gotta smash the brake.
[21474.02s -> 21476.92s]  We did this last time.
[21476.92s -> 21479.00s]  This like same scenario played out.
[21479.00s -> 21498.76s]  Hold on, let me cut this right here.
[21498.76s -> 21505.64s]  I gotta get this right because I can't go back on this.
[21505.64s -> 21506.95s]  Right there.
[21506.95s -> 21507.83s]  Looks good.
[21507.83s -> 21509.14s]  Okay.
[21509.14s -> 21531.61s]  I'm not gonna get rid of that yet because if it's wrong,
[21531.61s -> 21532.81s]  it's gotta be faster than that.
[21532.81s -> 21535.69s]  It's gotta be like slam, bang.
[21535.69s -> 21549.24s]  I'm gonna put clapping and audience applause and stuff through this.
[21560.25s -> 21560.97s]  It's a car.
[21560.97s -> 21562.01s]  The car was red.
[21565.11s -> 21565.91s]  Wait, what?
[21565.91s -> 21571.13s]  This is good.
[21571.13s -> 21573.21s]  I can add, I can, I'm gonna add sounds later.
[21573.21s -> 21579.98s]  Don't worry.
[21579.98s -> 21580.30s]  Wait.
[21597.59s -> 21598.71s]  This is one of the other clowns.
[21598.71s -> 21600.15s]  It's not even the same clown.
[21600.15s -> 21608.94s]  I don't want this in.
[21611.56s -> 21613.88s]  I don't think that that deserves to be in.
[21613.88s -> 21630.20s]  All right, let's, let's start.
[21630.20s -> 21638.54s]  I think that's good for cutting.
[21638.54s -> 21640.70s]  Yeah, this is, this is post credits.
[21640.70s -> 21647.88s]  Can I not put it there?
[21647.88s -> 21650.20s]  Come on, I can't put that in front of the credits.
[21657.16s -> 21658.20s]  All right, well, here we go.
[21658.20s -> 21661.10s]  I think it's, I think this is good.
[21669.24s -> 21672.02s]  Let's see if I can start recording here.
[21683.32s -> 21686.38s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage,
[21686.38s -> 21705.13s]  President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Steve Spruns.
[21705.13s -> 21705.85s]  I was supposed to say it worked.
[21705.85s -> 21721.22s]  Welcome to the stage, President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Steve Spruns.
[21721.22s -> 21723.46s]  What mic is it pulling from is what I want to know.
[21727.38s -> 21729.06s]  I gotta have more enthusiasm than that.
[21729.06s -> 21739.22s]  It's not pulling from the webcam.
[21739.22s -> 21740.10s]  No, I don't think so.
[21744.81s -> 21747.13s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.
[21748.31s -> 21756.65s]  And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.
[21756.65s -> 21766.94s]  Let's rise.
[21766.94s -> 21786.58s]  And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.
[21786.58s -> 21789.18s]  What mic is this even picking up?
[21789.18s -> 21790.46s]  Yeah, it's like I'm in another room.
[21790.46s -> 21790.86s]  Where is it?
[21790.86s -> 21793.24s]  Hold on, let me test something.
[21793.24s -> 21793.80s]  Find the mic.
[21803.75s -> 21804.55s]  Let's find it.
[21804.55s -> 21821.37s]  Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
[21821.37s -> 21829.14s]  Why is it having so much trouble with my mic?
[21829.14s -> 21835.72s]  It's this mic here.
[21835.72s -> 21837.56s]  No, that's not the dialogue.
[21837.56s -> 21845.16s]  I have to get like really close.
[21845.16s -> 21852.28s]  All right, let me get applause here.
[21852.28s -> 21856.81s]  Is there any, is it big applause?
[21856.81s -> 21870.82s]  I think this is just a shitty one.
[21870.82s -> 21882.81s]  I was going to put like a bunch of yawns in.
[21882.81s -> 21885.05s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.
[21885.69s -> 21892.81s]  And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment,
[21895.11s -> 21899.13s]  Strauns.
[21899.13s -> 21899.69s]  Strauns.
[21906.62s -> 21908.22s]  How about Bad Bad Bud?
[21912.86s -> 21919.78s]  President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.
[21927.50s -> 21932.38s]  I'm just gonna have fucking yawns everywhere.
[21932.38s -> 21934.06s]  This is so douchey.
[21935.66s -> 21936.78s]  Hold on, hold on.
[21936.78s -> 21942.04s]  Wait.
[21942.04s -> 21943.00s]  God Entertainment.
[21944.68s -> 21945.18s]  Greg.
[21963.83s -> 21964.33s]  Boo.
[21965.19s -> 21967.59s]  That doesn't even have to be a boo.
[21967.59s -> 21968.79s]  Oh My God.
[21969.18s -> 21971.58s]  I'm gonna go a little, let's start it a little bit more back here.
[21974.26s -> 21975.38s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you could.
[21982.65s -> 21984.97s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.
[21986.09s -> 21994.07s]  And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.
[21996.12s -> 21998.92s]  All right, they're like da-do da-do da-do da-do.
[22002.33s -> 22002.83s]  Boo.
[22003.85s -> 22010.04s]  God Entertainment.
[22010.84s -> 22013.11s]  Strauns.
[22017.85s -> 22018.35s]  Boo.
[22021.75s -> 22022.23s]  Right there.
[22025.10s -> 22026.78s]  I can't get rid of booing mail.
[22029.51s -> 22031.75s]  How many times are you gonna hear Greg Strauns?
[22032.55s -> 22034.07s]  Greg Strauns.
[22034.79s -> 22036.47s]  Greg Strauns.
[22036.47s -> 22037.51s]  Greg Strauns.
[22038.07s -> 22038.57s]  Boo.
[22055.99s -> 22059.27s]  Greg Strauns.
[22059.27s -> 22059.77s]  Boo.
[22068.01s -> 22068.51s]  Boo.
[22071.03s -> 22073.91s]  This is a lot of claps.
[22076.07s -> 22077.75s]  All right, I'll settle down everybody.
[22078.65s -> 22080.41s]  Okay, so we hear it.
[22081.21s -> 22083.29s]  I'm gonna shut, how do we shut this fucking music off?
[22102.34s -> 22104.02s]  I'm gonna get the laugh out of there.
[22105.14s -> 22110.73s]  All right, found it.
[22118.97s -> 22124.32s]  Okay.
[22130.47s -> 22132.47s]  Welcome everybody to E3.
[22133.35s -> 22137.83s]  I'm here to present to you two of our upcoming releases that I think you'll love.
[22139.16s -> 22146.52s]  And first of all, let me just be the first to say that E3, we're here.
[22146.52s -> 22148.60s]  Oh my God, that was not good.
[22149.24s -> 22154.58s]  Welcome everybody to E3.
[22155.38s -> 22159.96s]  I'm here to present to you two of our upcoming releases that I think you'll love.
[22161.35s -> 22168.63s]  And first of all, let me just be the first to say that E3, we're here.
[22168.63s -> 22175.83s]  Oh my God.
[22175.83s -> 22176.55s]  Okay, hold on.
[22177.35s -> 22178.23s]  I gotta write this out.
[22180.14s -> 22182.22s]  I gotta write this out because it's gonna be elaborate.
[22189.58s -> 22191.10s]  Okay, thank you.
[22191.10s -> 22192.14s]  Hey, hey, you in the back.
[22192.14s -> 22193.66s]  Hey, that's who I'm talking about.
[22194.14s -> 22195.58s]  Welcome to E3 everybody.
[22196.22s -> 22197.66s]  We're so happy to be here.
[22197.66s -> 22203.02s]  We are beyond excited to show you two new releases upcoming in our catalog of
[22203.02s -> 22204.86s]  Oh My God Entertainment Games.
[22204.86s -> 22209.02s]  That's Osmond, that's Michael, and that's Gary.
[22209.02s -> 22226.54s]  The three of us are who I'm talking about.
[22226.54s -> 22227.98s]  Welcome to E3 everybody.
[22228.62s -> 22230.06s]  We're so happy to be here.
[22230.06s -> 22233.98s]  We are beyond excited to show you two new releases
[22233.98s -> 22237.26s]  upcoming in our catalog of Oh My God Entertainment Games.
[22237.26s -> 22241.42s]  That's Osmond, that's Michael, and that's Gary.
[22241.42s -> 22243.02s]  Yeah, why is it so quiet?
[22243.02s -> 22244.78s]  I don't understand why it's so quiet.
[22257.80s -> 22258.68s]  Hold on, let me see.
[22259.48s -> 22261.06s]  I'm gonna save this for a second.
[22265.82s -> 22268.06s]  Maybe I have to go into like the sound options?
[22268.06s -> 22269.34s]  No, I don't think nothing was there.
[22270.87s -> 22272.95s]  It's probably a tech error happens at every E3.
[22277.11s -> 22279.43s]  I really would love to find a way to cut this.
[22280.31s -> 22289.75s]  Yeah, right clicking doesn't do anything.
[22289.75s -> 22290.95s]  Double clicking doesn't do anything.
[22300.01s -> 22302.25s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.
[22303.45s -> 22308.33s]  And welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment.
[22310.65s -> 22312.73s]  Raise the volume of the game in the windows mixer
[22312.73s -> 22315.05s]  and lower the music volume from the in-game slider.
[22316.09s -> 22316.81s]  Yeah, let me see.
[22317.53s -> 22318.92s]  That's not a bad idea.
[22320.14s -> 22321.42s]  That's a really good idea actually.
[22322.81s -> 22323.85s]  Let me save it, hold tight.
[22325.62s -> 22327.22s]  So, hold on.
[22327.22s -> 22332.49s]  Let me just get in here.
[22333.61s -> 22336.81s]  Let me mute this for a second.
[22337.45s -> 22341.13s]  I think what I actually have to do is go like actually into the game,
[22341.13s -> 22342.65s]  like the mixer of the game.
[22342.65s -> 22343.53s]  Yeah, like you're saying.
[22344.25s -> 22347.10s]  Let's see if that does anything.
[22347.10s -> 22352.60s]  Did that fix?
[22353.32s -> 22354.62s]  Can you see?
[22355.34s -> 22358.52s]  I wonder if that does anything.
[22359.08s -> 22360.44s]  Whoa, that's loud.
[22361.32s -> 22366.18s]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.
[22366.82s -> 22368.18s]  It's really loud for me now.
[22369.70s -> 22370.42s]  Hold on.
[22370.42s -> 22379.53s]  This is going to be really loud for me,
[22379.53s -> 22380.89s]  but it should be okay for you guys.
[22380.89s -> 22381.29s]  Let's see.
[22382.33s -> 22387.70s]  Tell me if this changes anything.
[22396.76s -> 22399.00s]  And welcome our president and CEO
[22399.96s -> 22401.88s]  of Oh My God Entertainment.
[22401.88s -> 22402.36s]  Here we go.
[22403.32s -> 22404.76s]  Greg Strauss.
[22406.36s -> 22408.12s]  Oh, but that's fucking loud as hell.
[22418.57s -> 22419.37s]  Thank you.
[22419.37s -> 22420.41s]  Hey, hey, you in the back.
[22420.41s -> 22422.41s]  Hey, that's who I'm talking about.
[22422.41s -> 22423.85s]  Welcome to E3 everybody.
[22424.49s -> 22425.93s]  We're so happy to be here.
[22425.93s -> 22429.85s]  We are beyond excited to show you two new releases
[22429.85s -> 22433.13s]  upcoming in our catalog of Oh My God Entertainment games.
[22433.13s -> 22434.73s]  That's Osmond.
[22434.73s -> 22435.93s]  That's Michael.
[22435.93s -> 22438.17s]  And that's Gary, the three of us.
[22442.50s -> 22445.14s]  All right, so how the fuck do I edit audio?
[22461.08s -> 22464.12s]  Yeah, I can't like drag and like resize anything.
[22465.00s -> 22468.54s]  I wonder if, hold on, can I do this?
[22468.54s -> 22469.50s]  Can I just like break it?
[22470.79s -> 22471.51s]  See if I do this.
[22482.95s -> 22484.47s]  Who's got the fucking phone on?
[22488.76s -> 22490.60s]  Yeah, I can't like drag the audio.
[22491.24s -> 22492.36s]  It just drags the whole thing.
[22494.94s -> 22496.06s]  Why?
[22496.06s -> 22500.33s]  I don't remember that being a problem.
[22500.33s -> 22504.60s]  Now the scissors cut the clip.
[22507.64s -> 22511.24s]  Audio options is just toggling on and off sound effects.
[22513.21s -> 22513.77s]  What the hell?
[22514.66s -> 22515.62s]  I think there's a way.
[22516.34s -> 22518.84s]  This guy, I think there's like a...
[22521.19s -> 22522.63s]  I don't know.
[22522.63s -> 22532.14s]  The game wiki says you can not edit the length.
[22532.14s -> 22538.20s]  I mean, I can just, you can cancel it out with something else.
[22538.76s -> 22543.91s]  I wish then I could just move it back, but no.
[22545.11s -> 22550.63s]  Oh well.
[22551.59s -> 22553.99s]  Just find the shortest music clip to cancel it out.
[22556.57s -> 22556.81s]  All right.
[22560.92s -> 22571.43s]  Because I have to record over this.
[22573.11s -> 22573.91s]  The three of us.
[22575.43s -> 22578.20s]  Okay, let's try this.

[22586.15s -> 22587.43s]  The three of us.
[22587.43s -> 22588.23s]  We created this.
[22588.87s -> 22589.27s]  We're...

[22623.67s -> 22624.95s]  Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[22625.77s -> 22626.01s]  Yeah.

[22665.34s -> 22666.62s]  Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[22667.42s -> 22667.66s]  Yeah.

[22931.14s -> 22932.02s]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[22932.02s -> 22935.22s]  Can you come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[22935.22s -> 22937.38s]  No, I had it on silent but it didn't work.
[22937.38s -> 22938.18s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[22938.90s -> 22939.38s]  Fuck you.
[22940.26s -> 22942.42s]  That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.
[22942.42s -> 22946.18s]  Yeah, you got a 72% Metacritic score across all your games.
[22947.38s -> 22948.18s]  I will smash you.
[22948.18s -> 22949.06s]  I'm gonna get it, man.
[22956.07s -> 22956.47s]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[22956.47s -> 22959.43s]  Can you come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[22960.39s -> 22961.67s]  I had it on silent but it didn't work.
[22961.67s -> 22962.71s]  Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[22963.51s -> 22963.83s]  Yeah.

[22975.59s -> 22977.59s]  Okay, hold on.
[22977.59s -> 22978.55s]  Wait a second.
[22980.68s -> 22981.88s]  I can do that better.
[22984.23s -> 22984.63s]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[22984.63s -> 22987.59s]  Can you come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[22988.62s -> 22990.54s]  I gotta be quicker on this one.
[22992.50s -> 22996.87s]  I wish I could grab the right one.
[22996.87s -> 22998.15s]  Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[23003.99s -> 23007.38s]  Yeah, why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23008.18s -> 23010.17s]  This clip is too long.

[23013.37s -> 23020.44s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[23021.24s -> 23024.65s]  Yeah, why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23026.42s -> 23027.46s]  This clip is too long.
[23036.42s -> 23037.06s]  That's it.
[23038.94s -> 23039.98s]  Record silenced.
[23040.70s -> 23043.18s]  It's not gonna work because they layer on top of each other.
[23046.70s -> 23048.30s]  You get up here and start talking to me.
[23049.18s -> 23051.10s]  This clip is too long.
[23051.98s -> 23054.41s]  I don't give a shit.

[23063.19s -> 23063.99s]  I don't give a shit.
[23066.92s -> 23067.88s]  This clip is too long.
[23067.88s -> 23070.44s]  I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

[23093.66s -> 23094.22s]  This is like...
[23095.50s -> 23096.86s]  All right, I gotta get this right first try.
[23096.86s -> 23097.18s]  Here we go.
[23099.18s -> 23101.88s]  Can you turn the phone off?
[23101.88s -> 23102.28s]  Sorry.
[23102.84s -> 23103.16s]  Sorry.
[23103.16s -> 23106.12s]  You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[23106.12s -> 23107.08s]  I thought it was on silent.
[23107.08s -> 23107.56s]  I'm sorry.
[23107.56s -> 23108.20s]  I screwed up.
[23108.20s -> 23109.88s]  Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[23109.88s -> 23111.24s]  I don't want to go up there.
[23111.24s -> 23111.64s]  No.
[23111.64s -> 23113.72s]  Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23113.72s -> 23114.84s]  Your company sucks anyways.
[23114.84s -> 23115.64s]  I'm only here because I have to.
[23115.64s -> 23116.44s]  This clip is too long.

[23161.62s -> 23163.62s]  Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23165.37s -> 23166.41s]  This clip is too long.
[23172.60s -> 23173.96s]  Dude, the first one was better.
[23175.16s -> 23178.92s]  I wish I could just fucking trim audio clips.
[23183.64s -> 23184.44s]  I don't give a shit.

[23198.41s -> 23199.21s]  Here we go.
[23199.21s -> 23201.45s]  I don't care how it's broadcasted live.
[23206.01s -> 23206.73s]  Fuck.
[23206.73s -> 23207.37s]  I don't give a shit.
[23207.37s -> 23208.49s]  This clip is too long.
[23208.49s -> 23211.05s]  I don't care how it's broadcasted live.
[23211.05s -> 23212.01s]  I will smash you.
[23214.44s -> 23216.28s]  There's no waveforms.
[23216.28s -> 23217.08s]  Oh my God.
[23217.72s -> 23220.28s]  I don't care if it's broadcasted live.
[23220.28s -> 23221.24s]  I will smash you.
[23222.60s -> 23223.08s]  Okay.
[23223.08s -> 23223.56s]  That's it.
[23223.56s -> 23224.44s]  I got this.
[23224.44s -> 23225.00s]  I don't know.
[23225.00s -> 23225.88s]  I'm not going to touch this.
[23227.10s -> 23227.66s]  Put cheering.
[23227.66s -> 23227.98s]  You know what?
[23227.98s -> 23228.46s]  I will.
[23228.46s -> 23229.58s]  I'm going to get this.
[23232.18s -> 23232.58s]  All right.
[23232.58s -> 23233.30s]  I want to show you guys.
[23233.30s -> 23235.70s]  So I'm going to show you what the scissors do.
[23235.70s -> 23237.94s]  The scissors split the scene.
[23237.94s -> 23239.14s]  If they don't split the audio.
[23239.14s -> 23240.34s]  We tried it already.
[23240.34s -> 23241.22s]  We tried it already.
[23241.22s -> 23241.86s]  Somebody's rated?
[23241.86s -> 23242.66s]  Who rated?
[23242.66s -> 23244.18s]  We got a rate?
[23248.98s -> 23249.54s]  Oh shit.
[23253.46s -> 23254.34s]  Joel coming in with a rate.
[23254.34s -> 23255.14s]  Hey, thanks Joel.
[23256.79s -> 23258.82s]  Welcome everybody.
[23258.82s -> 23266.81s]  We're currently fumbling our way through the movies for a second time.
[23266.81s -> 23268.09s]  I have all these things recorded.
[23268.09s -> 23270.97s]  I'm trying to painstakingly put this together.
[23271.53s -> 23272.81s]  I hope you had a good stream.
[23273.86s -> 23276.74s]  And stick around if you'd like to see how this plays out.
[23276.74s -> 23278.94s]  But thanks a lot, Joel.
[23278.94s -> 23279.90s]  Welcome everybody.
[23279.90s -> 23282.89s]  Hope you're having a good fucking day.
[23282.89s -> 23285.96s]  This is my YouTuber voice now.
[23285.96s -> 23287.64s]  Can you turn the phone off?
[23288.28s -> 23288.60s]  Okay.
[23288.60s -> 23289.48s]  I'm going to go for it again.

[23306.30s -> 23308.98s]  Can you turn the phone off?
[23308.98s -> 23309.86s]  I'm sorry.
[23309.86s -> 23310.50s]  My phone's on.
[23310.50s -> 23313.54s]  You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[23313.54s -> 23315.78s]  Look, you got a 68% of Medicare to go to all your games.
[23315.78s -> 23316.90s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[23316.90s -> 23317.78s]  I just said that to you.
[23317.78s -> 23318.82s]  So it doesn't matter.
[23318.82s -> 23320.50s]  Why don't you get up here and start talking.
[23320.50s -> 23321.38s]  I'm going up there.
[23321.38s -> 23322.10s]  I'm going up there.
[23322.10s -> 23323.22s]  Just let go.
[23324.26s -> 23325.22s]  I'm getting up here right now.
[23325.22s -> 23327.22s]  If it's broadcasted live, I will smash you.
[23327.22s -> 23328.02s]  What are you going to say to him?
[23334.57s -> 23340.62s]  I got it.
[23340.62s -> 23341.50s]  Where'd it go?
[23341.50s -> 23349.32s]  Where is it?
[23349.32s -> 23352.89s]  Oh.
[23352.89s -> 23353.85s]  No, I'm going up there.
[23353.85s -> 23356.41s]  I don't care if it's broadcasted live.
[23356.41s -> 23357.13s]  I will smash you.
[23360.01s -> 23360.33s]  Okay.

[23383.38s -> 23384.02s]  Fuck you.
[23384.02s -> 23384.58s]  I'm going up there.
[23384.58s -> 23385.06s]  It's too close.
[23385.06s -> 23385.62s]  I'm going up there.
[23385.62s -> 23386.42s]  Just let go.
[23386.42s -> 23388.82s]  I don't care if it's broadcasted live.
[23388.82s -> 23389.86s]  I will smash you.
[23390.58s -> 23391.54s]  What are you going to say to him?
[23394.86s -> 23395.90s]  Dialogue 12.
[23395.90s -> 23396.94s]  Dialogue 12.
[23403.69s -> 23406.73s]  Oh, I would love to get dialogue 14 out of here.
[23406.73s -> 23407.45s]  Oh, no.
[23409.86s -> 23412.74s]  I would fucking love to be able to get dialogue 14.
[23420.54s -> 23421.10s]  Got it.
[23421.10s -> 23422.62s]  Okay.
[23432.50s -> 23433.22s]  I'm going to give this...
[23433.86s -> 23434.50s]  I'm going to bring in...
[23434.50s -> 23435.30s]  Let's bring in 12.
[23442.34s -> 23443.22s]  What does 12 start?
[23453.10s -> 23453.66s]  Sorry.
[23453.66s -> 23454.22s]  I'm sorry.
[23454.94s -> 23455.18s]  Okay.
[23455.18s -> 23455.98s]  Let's get this up.
[23455.98s -> 23456.62s]  This is the one?
[23457.94s -> 23461.91s]  Well, it's got to be in the right spot.
[23461.91s -> 23463.03s]  Can you turn the phone off?
[23463.67s -> 23467.59s]  You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[23468.23s -> 23469.86s]  Yeah.
[23469.86s -> 23470.90s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[23482.54s -> 23483.74s]  Oh, my God.
[23484.86s -> 23486.62s]  I'm just going to have to like leave it.
[23486.62s -> 23487.90s]  It's unworkable.
[23491.10s -> 23492.30s]  It just truly is.
[23494.87s -> 23496.79s]  You can't use this.
[23498.23s -> 23503.85s]  I'm going to have to redo everything.
[23503.85s -> 23506.41s]  I'm so excited and so ready to present to you.
[23507.43s -> 23508.39s]  I'm just going to do them all.
[23508.39s -> 23509.43s]  I'm going to do it twice.
[23509.43s -> 23509.91s]  Here we go.
[23510.55s -> 23511.05s]  Ah.
[23516.92s -> 23518.60s]  It's got to be done correct the first time.
[23519.24s -> 23521.35s]  Our new cat.
[23523.46s -> 23524.58s]  Can you turn the phone off?
[23525.14s -> 23529.13s]  You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[23529.85s -> 23531.42s]  Yeah.
[23531.42s -> 23532.46s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[23533.26s -> 23533.82s]  Yeah.
[23533.82s -> 23534.54s]  Oh.
[23534.54s -> 23537.58s]  That's why don't you get up here and record it externally.
[23537.58s -> 23538.70s]  I don't think I can bring it in.
[23538.70s -> 23539.10s]  Can I?
[23539.74s -> 23542.36s]  I'd have to restart the game.
[23545.35s -> 23546.95s]  I think I'm just going too ambitious.
[23547.51s -> 23553.62s]  So what was 10?
[23564.71s -> 23565.67s]  No, there's nothing even here.
[23566.31s -> 23568.66s]  I got to move on from the intro.
[23569.30s -> 23574.98s]  Conference, you don't turn your cell phone off?
[23574.98s -> 23575.70s]  This one's fine.
[23577.02s -> 23577.18s]  Yeah.
[23577.18s -> 23578.30s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[23579.10s -> 23579.60s]  Yeah.
[23580.38s -> 23582.54s]  That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.
[23584.25s -> 23584.73s]  This clip.
[23585.29s -> 23587.30s]  Okay.
[23587.30s -> 23589.77s]  Here we go.
[23589.77s -> 23590.65s]  Oh my God.
[23590.65s -> 23591.05s]  Hold on.
[23591.69s -> 23593.21s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23596.63s -> 23598.07s]  I'm in close now.
[23598.07s -> 23603.53s]  I think I can do it from here.
[23609.02s -> 23609.90s]  Let's grab 12.
[23614.90s -> 23616.34s]  We have to just super enhance.
[23622.10s -> 23624.42s]  Yeah.
[23624.42s -> 23625.54s]  Oh my God.
[23625.54s -> 23628.42s]  I would literally do anything to be.
[23630.02s -> 23630.98s]  It's on top of it.
[23630.98s -> 23631.94s]  Why can't I click it?
[23631.94s -> 23633.38s]  It's on top.
[23633.38s -> 23634.90s]  It is on the top.
[23635.62s -> 23645.59s]  Come up here then.
[23647.91s -> 23649.83s]  Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23652.17s -> 23652.89s]  Okay.
[23652.89s -> 23654.41s]  I'm fucking leaving it like this.
[23659.06s -> 23659.86s]  Turn the phone off.
[23662.49s -> 23663.61s]  I can grab it from here.
[23663.61s -> 23666.17s]  I guess you have to have a little tail out to even select it.
[23666.17s -> 23668.01s]  You come to an E3 conference.
[23668.01s -> 23669.05s]  You don't turn your cell phone off?
[23669.05s -> 23669.61s]  It didn't work.
[23670.98s -> 23671.38s]  Fuck you.
[23671.38s -> 23672.50s]  Why don't you come up here then?
[23674.81s -> 23677.05s]  Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23677.77s -> 23678.41s]  I'm gonna get it.
[23681.46s -> 23682.02s]  I'm gonna get it.
[23682.82s -> 23686.58s]  I think that's closing up.
[23690.44s -> 23692.20s]  You come to an E3 conference.
[23692.20s -> 23692.68s]  You don't try.
[23693.85s -> 23694.81s]  We're stuck here forever.
[23694.81s -> 23696.89s]  We're stuck in like this loop forever.
[23696.89s -> 23697.53s]  Three conference.
[23697.53s -> 23698.73s]  You don't turn your cell phone off?
[23699.53s -> 23700.97s]  Yeah.
[23700.97s -> 23701.93s]  Why don't you just come up here then?
[23701.93s -> 23710.28s]  You got a 72% medical score across all your games.
[23710.28s -> 23712.28s]  Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[23712.28s -> 23712.84s]  I'm gonna get it.
[23716.10s -> 23716.66s]  I got it.
[23733.85s -> 23734.65s]  So excited.
[23752.42s -> 23753.22s]  So excited.
[23754.58s -> 23755.78s]  What happened here?
[23756.68s -> 23757.16s]  Why is it...
[23758.44s -> 23760.04s]  That's Osmond.
[23760.04s -> 23761.24s]  That's Michael.
[23761.24s -> 23762.68s]  And that's Gary.
[23762.68s -> 23764.36s]  The three of us are...
[23770.87s -> 23771.83s]  So excited.
[23771.83s -> 23772.87s]  So ex...
[23772.87s -> 23774.71s]  So, so, so...
[23777.59s -> 23781.59s]  The three of us are...
[23782.23s -> 23784.63s]  So, so, so...
[23785.88s -> 23786.12s]  Just...
[23788.14s -> 23788.94s]  So excited.
[23788.94s -> 23790.54s]  And so ready to present to you.
[23790.54s -> 23791.04s]  Sorry.
[23791.82s -> 23799.85s]  It's not possible.
[23799.85s -> 23805.16s]  There's a folder for the movies in my documents.
[23805.16s -> 23806.84s]  You put a wav file in there.
[23806.84s -> 23807.80s]  Wait, what?
[23807.80s -> 23814.54s]  Is that for real?
[23829.53s -> 23831.61s]  If I put a wav in my documents,
[23831.61s -> 23832.89s]  I don't have to close the game, you're saying?
[23835.26s -> 23836.38s]  Documents the movies.
[23838.31s -> 23839.35s]  Movie sounds.
[23842.68s -> 23844.12s]  Oh, would you look at that?
[23844.12s -> 23845.00s]  Holy shit.
[23845.00s -> 23845.56s]  Okay.
[23845.56s -> 23846.60s]  It's possible.
[23846.60s -> 23852.54s]  I got them all right here.
[23852.54s -> 23854.68s]  Okay, hold on.
[23854.68s -> 23855.16s]  Give me a second.
[23861.50s -> 23864.46s]  We are just so excited to have you...
[23864.46s -> 23866.34s]  Actually, all I need is the...
[23866.98s -> 23867.38s]  All right.
[23867.38s -> 23868.18s]  This is gonna be hard though,
[23868.18s -> 23868.50s]  because I don't...
[23871.08s -> 23872.04s]  I don't have borderless windows,
[23872.04s -> 23873.72s]  so I have to like fucking rip down
[23873.72s -> 23874.92s]  every single time I want to change.
[23875.56s -> 23877.45s]  You know what I mean?
[23877.45s -> 23878.57s]  I can't like have it open
[23878.57s -> 23879.93s]  and record it at the same time.
[23882.41s -> 23885.21s]  Like it's hard, hard, full screen.
[23885.77s -> 23888.86s]  See what I'm saying?
[23888.86s -> 23890.70s]  Like the audacity is on the other monitor.
[23891.26s -> 23895.98s]  So I have to like...
[23895.98s -> 23897.02s]  I can't lip sync it.
[23897.66s -> 23902.46s]  Just watch a clip of it.
[23903.50s -> 23905.67s]  All right, let me just see how this looks.
[23906.23s -> 23907.11s]  Present to you.
[23907.11s -> 23907.67s]  Sorry.
[23907.67s -> 23908.23s]  I'm sorry.
[23909.03s -> 23912.06s]  Turn the music off.
[23913.42s -> 23915.80s]  Can I turn this music off?
[23916.76s -> 23918.68s]  Can you turn the phone off?
[23918.68s -> 23920.36s]  I turned it on silent, but it didn't work.
[23920.36s -> 23922.20s]  You come to an E3 conference
[23922.20s -> 23923.40s]  and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[23924.73s -> 23926.81s]  Yeah, oh, you got a 72%
[23926.81s -> 23928.89s]  Metacritic score across all your games.
[23928.89s -> 23930.01s]  Why don't you get up here
[23930.01s -> 23930.89s]  and start talking to me?
[23931.61s -> 23937.67s]  Okay, I got to link actors here.
[23937.67s -> 23939.27s]  I wish I could just give me two of these.
[23939.27s -> 23941.27s]  Give me two audio timelines.
[23941.27s -> 23941.77s]  Just...
[23952.47s -> 23952.79s]  I think...
[23952.79s -> 23954.95s]  I think it's not gonna work.
[23954.95s -> 23955.91s]  I'm gonna have to redo them all.
[23956.73s -> 23957.13s]  Just redo...
[23957.13s -> 23958.17s]  I'm gonna redo it all.
[23958.17s -> 23959.86s]  Here we go.
[23959.86s -> 23961.67s]  And then I'm moving on.
[23961.67s -> 23962.79s]  I'm only doing this two...
[23962.79s -> 23963.27s]  That's it.
[23963.27s -> 23964.07s]  I'm only doing this twice.
[23981.30s -> 23983.06s]  Okay, so I need the ringtone.
[23985.13s -> 23985.69s]  All right, here we go.
[23987.14s -> 23988.10s]  That's Michael.
[23988.98s -> 23990.18s]  It's time to call my editors.
[23990.18s -> 23991.30s]  It's time to call...
[23991.30s -> 23994.34s]  Please, God, give me one other timeline
[23994.34s -> 23996.26s]  and let me drag and trim clips.
[23996.26s -> 23997.38s]  What were you thinking?
[24001.38s -> 24003.38s]  It was like 2003.
[24003.38s -> 24004.82s]  So, here we go.
[24004.82s -> 24008.52s]  Here we go.
[24008.52s -> 24010.92s]  Two new releases upcoming
[24010.92s -> 24013.72s]  in our catalog of oh my God entertainment games.
[24013.72s -> 24015.32s]  That's Osmond.
[24015.32s -> 24016.52s]  That's Michael.
[24016.52s -> 24017.88s]  And that's Gary.
[24017.88s -> 24022.20s]  The three of us are so excited for you to be here
[24022.20s -> 24023.56s]  at this E3N.
[24024.92s -> 24025.56s]  I can hear that.
[24025.56s -> 24026.92s]  I can hear something over here.
[24028.87s -> 24030.55s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24031.35s -> 24031.91s]  Turn the phone...
[24032.81s -> 24034.89s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.
[24035.53s -> 24036.89s]  Turn the phone off!
[24036.89s -> 24039.69s]  You're gonna come to E.T. and try to come to my conference?
[24040.63s -> 24041.43s]  That's two phones.
[24042.23s -> 24043.27s]  Come on, get up here then.
[24043.27s -> 24044.39s]  Get up here, motherfucker.
[24044.39s -> 24045.19s]  I'll take it right now.
[24045.59s -> 24046.09s]  I...
[24047.98s -> 24048.48s]  Don't ever...
[24049.98s -> 24050.54s]  My head hurts.
[24056.54s -> 24057.10s]  Got it.
[24057.10s -> 24060.97s]  Don't touch anything.
[24060.97s -> 24065.13s]  New releases upcoming in our catalog of oh my God entertainment games.
[24065.13s -> 24066.73s]  That's Osmond.
[24066.73s -> 24067.85s]  That's Michael.
[24067.85s -> 24069.29s]  And that's Gary.
[24069.29s -> 24074.97s]  The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.
[24081.22s -> 24082.25s]  I can hear that.
[24082.25s -> 24083.53s]  I can hear something over here.
[24086.20s -> 24087.24s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24087.96s -> 24088.52s]  Turn the phone...
[24091.75s -> 24093.67s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone...
[24094.39s -> 24104.01s]  All right, let me link this audio, this one, to Studio Head.
[24105.42s -> 24108.78s]  Linking sound to actor will process the sound for lip-syncing information.
[24109.42s -> 24115.50s]  Due to the length of the clip, the lip-syncing quality may diminish slightly.
[24118.66s -> 24121.30s]  That's Michael and that's Gary.
[24121.30s -> 24122.98s]  The three of us are...
[24128.42s -> 24130.22s]  Let me ask you this though.
[24131.16s -> 24132.04s]  What just happened?
[24135.06s -> 24136.10s]  Now it's not even...
[24136.10s -> 24137.14s]  How is it not synced up?
[24137.14s -> 24137.94s]  I didn't do anything.
[24137.94s -> 24143.14s]  The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.
[24143.14s -> 24143.62s]  No, it's fine.
[24144.90s -> 24145.54s]  I can hear that.
[24145.54s -> 24147.06s]  I can hear something over here.
[24147.06s -> 24147.86s]  No, it's not gonna work.
[24149.46s -> 24150.50s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24152.50s -> 24154.90s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.
[24155.54s -> 24156.90s]  Turn the phone up.
[24156.90s -> 24159.62s]  You're gonna come to E-Team and try to come to my conference?
[24160.58s -> 24161.38s]  That's two phones.
[24162.18s -> 24163.22s]  Come on, get up here then.
[24163.22s -> 24164.26s]  Get up here, motherfucker.
[24164.34s -> 24165.14s]  I'll take you right now.
[24167.93s -> 24168.41s]  Don't ever...
[24169.05s -> 24170.49s]  My head hurts.
[24171.69s -> 24172.81s]  Okay, it fucking worked.
[24173.85s -> 24175.69s]  I just have to get this right.
[24175.69s -> 24178.97s]  I've got to get this one right and then I've got to get it perfect.
[24183.34s -> 24183.98s]  Here we go.
[24183.98s -> 24184.78s]  It's got to be perfect.
[24185.66s -> 24188.22s]  That's Michael and that's Gary.
[24188.22s -> 24194.22s]  The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.
[24195.58s -> 24197.54s]  I can hear something over here.
[24197.62s -> 24198.02s]  That's me.
[24198.02s -> 24198.50s]  I'm sorry.
[24200.26s -> 24201.22s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24203.46s -> 24205.30s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.
[24205.30s -> 24206.26s]  That's my phone.
[24206.26s -> 24207.06s]  Turn the phone up.
[24207.62s -> 24210.34s]  You're gonna come to E-Team and try to come to my conference?
[24210.34s -> 24211.30s]  Fuck you.
[24211.30s -> 24212.58s]  That's two phones.
[24212.58s -> 24213.94s]  Your company sucks.
[24213.94s -> 24214.98s]  42% medic.
[24214.98s -> 24216.18s]  I'm going up there.
[24216.18s -> 24216.98s]  What are you gonna do about it?
[24218.65s -> 24219.13s]  Don't ever...
[24220.65s -> 24221.21s]  My head hurts.
[24224.98s -> 24225.78s]  Got it.
[24225.78s -> 24227.10s]  Done.
[24227.10s -> 24227.90s]  Print it.
[24227.90s -> 24228.86s]  Ship it out.
[24228.86s -> 24231.82s]  Excited to show you two new releases
[24231.82s -> 24235.18s]  upcoming in our catalog of oh my god entertainment games.
[24235.18s -> 24236.78s]  That's Osmond.
[24236.78s -> 24239.34s]  That's Michael and that's Gary.
[24239.34s -> 24244.78s]  The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.
[24246.30s -> 24246.94s]  I can hear that.
[24246.94s -> 24248.30s]  I can hear something over here.
[24248.30s -> 24248.70s]  That's me.
[24248.70s -> 24249.18s]  I'm sorry.
[24250.94s -> 24251.90s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24254.18s -> 24256.02s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.
[24256.02s -> 24256.98s]  That's my phone.
[24256.98s -> 24257.78s]  Turn the phone up.
[24258.26s -> 24260.98s]  You're gonna come to E-Team and try to come to my conference?
[24260.98s -> 24261.46s]  Fuck you.
[24262.02s -> 24262.74s]  That's two phones.
[24263.30s -> 24264.58s]  Your company sucks.
[24264.58s -> 24265.70s]  42% medic.
[24265.70s -> 24266.82s]  I'm going up there right now.
[24266.82s -> 24267.62s]  What are you gonna do about it?
[24269.30s -> 24269.78s]  Don't ever...
[24270.42s -> 24270.74s]  My head...
[24270.74s -> 24271.30s]  I'm gonna...
[24271.30s -> 24271.94s]  My head hurts.
[24274.81s -> 24275.37s]  You know what?
[24275.37s -> 24277.45s]  This is like the equivalent of trying to edit a video
[24277.45s -> 24279.29s]  while you're like swimming upstream.
[24283.53s -> 24285.05s]  It's like trying to like make a video
[24285.05s -> 24293.75s]  about somebody dumping like a bucket of water on your head.
[24293.75s -> 24297.03s]  What I just did right there takes like 36 seconds.
[24297.03s -> 24299.61s]  God damn salmon.
[24299.61s -> 24308.92s]  That takes like eight seconds.
[24315.58s -> 24315.90s]  Okay.
[24315.90s -> 24316.78s]  Here we go.
[24323.43s -> 24324.79s]  Now we just have to get the reactions.
[24328.41s -> 24329.21s]  Thank you.
[24329.21s -> 24330.81s]  Hey, hey, you in the back.
[24330.81s -> 24336.70s]  I just wish I could shut this off.
[24339.38s -> 24339.62s]  Okay.
[24339.62s -> 24340.34s]  Here we go.
[24340.34s -> 24349.93s]  Should they clap for this?
[24356.01s -> 24358.81s]  I think I have to turn off like the ambient sounds too.
[24358.81s -> 24359.53s]  Because all you just...
[24362.73s -> 24364.09s]  Who the fuck is that person?
[24366.23s -> 24368.44s]  I can hear something over here.
[24368.44s -> 24368.84s]  That's me.
[24368.84s -> 24369.32s]  I'm sorry.
[24370.28s -> 24370.92s]  Can you turn...
[24370.92s -> 24371.88s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24372.68s -> 24374.15s]  Turn the phone.
[24374.15s -> 24376.07s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.
[24376.07s -> 24376.95s]  That's my phone.
[24376.95s -> 24377.75s]  Turn the phone up.
[24378.31s -> 24381.11s]  You're gonna come to ET and try to come to my conference?
[24381.11s -> 24381.99s]  Fuck you.
[24381.99s -> 24382.39s]  That's too...
[24385.83s -> 24387.03s]  Paid audience.
[24415.51s -> 24416.63s]  So happy to be here.
[24416.63s -> 24418.23s]  We are beyond excited to show...
[24419.19s -> 24420.25s]  All right.
[24420.25s -> 24421.21s]  Let's put in some booze.
[24435.72s -> 24437.16s]  This is where all the effort's gone.
[24453.62s -> 24454.74s]  Can you turn off the phone?
[24456.98s -> 24458.58s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a...
[24459.22s -> 24460.74s]  Is it like a gasp?
[24461.46s -> 24480.30s]  It's a laugh, scream, slurp, sniff, snore, spit.
[24480.30s -> 24488.87s]  That's my phone.
[24491.03s -> 24491.99s]  Idiots has a phone.
[24491.99s -> 24492.79s]  That's my phone.
[24492.79s -> 24493.29s]  Turn the...
[24497.24s -> 24498.20s]  Just spitting.
[24502.04s -> 24504.76s]  One guy just turns it like medieval times.
[24506.84s -> 24509.30s]  That's what I think about your conference.
[24517.58s -> 24518.30s]  That's my phone.
[24518.46s -> 24519.26s]  Turn the phone up.
[24519.74s -> 24522.70s]  You're gonna come to ET and try to come to my conference?
[24522.70s -> 24523.20s]  Fuck you.
[24529.32s -> 24531.32s]  Somebody's just gonna laugh after that.
[24531.32s -> 24531.80s]  Fuck you.
[24532.92s -> 24534.57s]  Try to come to my conference?
[24534.57s -> 24535.05s]  Fuck you.
[24537.75s -> 24538.55s]  That's two phones.
[24539.99s -> 24540.95s]  That's not...
[24541.99s -> 24545.86s]  I thought that was a laugh.
[24547.00s -> 24548.52s]  That's a chicken, apparently.
[24548.52s -> 24555.34s]  Fuck you.
[24559.62s -> 24560.34s]  Fuck you.
[24560.34s -> 24561.22s]  That's two phones.
[24561.94s -> 24562.66s]  Come on, get off of me.
[24562.66s -> 24563.14s]  Sucks.
[24563.14s -> 24564.34s]  42% of magic.
[24564.34s -> 24565.46s]  Stop going up there.
[24565.46s -> 24565.94s]  What are you gonna do?
[24569.86s -> 24572.76s]  What?
[24573.00s -> 24575.08s]  Why does this mysteriously move?
[24576.14s -> 24576.78s]  Conference?
[24576.78s -> 24577.58s]  Fuck you.
[24577.58s -> 24578.38s]  That's two phones.
[24579.58s -> 24579.82s]  Get off of me.
[24579.82s -> 24580.38s]  Sucks.
[24580.38s -> 24581.50s]  42% of magic.
[24581.50s -> 24582.62s]  Stop going up there.
[24582.62s -> 24583.18s]  What are you gonna do?
[24594.39s -> 24595.83s]  One, two, three.
[24609.11s -> 24619.96s]  What does this sound like?
[24633.45s -> 24635.21s]  What sound even is this?
[24635.53s -> 24636.01s]  What are you gonna do?
[24642.55s -> 24643.35s]  Apparently, I don't know.
[24648.97s -> 24650.33s]  Neck breaking sound.
[24650.33s -> 24650.81s]  Hold on.
[24654.30s -> 24655.10s]  Bone break.
[24663.45s -> 24663.93s]  What are you gonna do?
[24674.89s -> 24677.05s]  I'm so desperately trying to...
[24677.05s -> 24677.53s]  What are you gonna do?
[24681.05s -> 24682.33s]  It was a double tap.
[24687.77s -> 24689.42s]  That's like...
[24689.42s -> 24690.94s]  It's not loud enough.
[24690.94s -> 24700.55s]  Why do you guys want, like, breaking bones so bad?
[24700.55s -> 24701.75s]  A nice crunchy one.
[24701.75s -> 24703.83s]  Bone break 02.
[24704.55s -> 24705.88s]  How's this one?
[24709.05s -> 24710.57s]  Okay, that's really bad.
[24710.57s -> 24712.73s]  That's really, really, really, really awful.
[24730.65s -> 24733.05s]  The thing is, who's neck is breaking here?
[24736.62s -> 24738.06s]  It could be either one of them.
[24738.54s -> 24739.10s]  What are you gonna do?
[24739.10s -> 24739.82s]  Get out.
[24740.54s -> 24741.75s]  Don't hurt me.
[24741.75s -> 24742.15s]  On my head.
[24742.15s -> 24743.03s]  I'm gonna fuck my...
[24779.10s -> 24779.58s]  Okay.
[24780.14s -> 24781.78s]  What are you gonna do?
[24781.78s -> 24782.34s]  Get out.
[24782.34s -> 24791.11s]  Don't hurt me.
[24791.11s -> 24792.15s]  Don't hurt me.
[24792.15s -> 24792.63s]  Whatever.
[24793.27s -> 24798.65s]  We need to fade this out.
[24798.65s -> 24799.93s]  I gotta fade out.
[24799.93s -> 24808.22s]  Okay, so this is the first game.
[24808.22s -> 24813.10s]  I need to fade out transition here.
[24813.10s -> 24814.86s]  No, no fart on fall.
[24814.86s -> 24816.14s]  Absolutely not.
[24816.14s -> 24816.70s]  No way.
[24817.50s -> 24818.70s]  Absolutely not.
[24818.70s -> 24821.91s]  Fade in.
[24821.91s -> 24829.94s]  This goes so quickly to the next clip.
[24829.94s -> 24839.75s]  All right, not in-game footage.
[24839.75s -> 24848.92s]  All right, we're moving on.
[24848.92s -> 24855.42s]  The last fart went over so well.
[24855.42s -> 24858.68s]  We're not doing another fart.
[24858.68s -> 24859.88s]  World Premiere.
[24859.88s -> 24860.44s]  Yeah, hold on.
[24866.87s -> 24868.23s]  World Premiere.
[24868.23s -> 24870.50s]  That was awful!
[24870.50s -> 24871.78s]  Oh, that was bad.
[24871.78s -> 24874.95s]  That was terrible.
[24874.95s -> 24877.59s]  I'm not deleting this one as soon as possible.
[24881.61s -> 24882.97s]  That was awful!
[24889.72s -> 24890.12s]  Awful.
[24897.45s -> 24898.49s]  World Premiere.
[24899.45s -> 24902.54s]  Don't die on me!
[24902.54s -> 24906.66s]  Don't you die on me!
[24906.66s -> 24907.90s]  Come on!
[24907.90s -> 24909.67s]  No!
[24909.67s -> 24911.19s]  You're my co-captain!
[24911.75s -> 24913.24s]  You're my co-pilot!
[24928.22s -> 24928.62s]  No!
[24943.43s -> 24944.15s]  Don't die on me!
[24944.95s -> 24948.84s]  Don't you die on me!
[24948.84s -> 24949.94s]  Come on!
[24949.94s -> 24952.20s]  No!
[24952.20s -> 24953.64s]  My co-captain!
[24953.64s -> 24955.30s]  You're my co-pilot!
[24975.67s -> 24977.27s]  Forest exposition.
[24984.74s -> 24985.46s]  Don't die on me!
[24987.70s -> 24988.18s]  Will it work?
[24988.98s -> 24990.26s]  Don't you die on me!
[24990.26s -> 24992.50s]  Come on!
[24992.50s -> 24993.61s]  No!
[24993.61s -> 24995.05s]  My co-captain!
[24995.05s -> 24996.41s]  You're my co-
[24996.41s -> 25000.36s]  All right, we need a subtitle.
[25000.36s -> 25002.76s]  How do I add a subtitle here?
[25002.76s -> 25010.74s]  Reviewing technology?
[25010.74s -> 25011.14s]  Where is it?
[25013.53s -> 25014.41s]  Oh, no, don't worry.
[25014.41s -> 25015.93s]  I'm gonna add sounds.
[25015.93s -> 25020.57s]  Where is it?
[25025.51s -> 25026.71s]  World Premiere.
[25027.67s -> 25052.95s]  Oh, here we go.
[25052.95s -> 25053.99s]  World Premiere.
[25056.92s -> 25057.64s]  Don't die on me!
[25062.58s -> 25066.65s]  Don't die on me!
[25066.65s -> 25067.53s]  Don't you die on me!
[25068.09s -> 25070.20s]  Come on!
[25070.20s -> 25071.29s]  No!
[25071.29s -> 25072.33s]  My co-captain!
[25072.81s -> 25076.09s]  You're my co-pilot!
[25076.09s -> 25076.81s]  Please, lip sync.
[25087.90s -> 25089.34s]  Come on, do it!
[25089.34s -> 25089.84s]  No!
[25106.52s -> 25110.66s]  I'm getting strange readings coming from upstairs.
[25110.66s -> 25112.66s]  I wonder if that isn't anything to do with the-
[25114.42s -> 25115.06s]  Normality!
[25115.06s -> 25115.62s]  What is that?
[25116.42s -> 25116.92s]  Oh!
[25119.06s -> 25120.34s]  This one's washed, but it's-
[25124.41s -> 25128.23s]  I'm getting strange readings coming from upstairs.
[25128.95s -> 25130.87s]  I wonder if that isn't anything to do with the-
[25131.91s -> 25132.41s]  The-
[25132.71s -> 25133.27s]  Normality!
[25133.27s -> 25133.91s]  What is that?
[25134.71s -> 25135.21s]  Oh!
[25139.03s -> 25140.39s]  No, that's, like, too awful.
[25161.72s -> 25164.52s]  Yeah, I'm getting a reading about something-
[25165.56s -> 25167.93s]  Organic creature up here.
[25167.93s -> 25168.41s]  I don't know.
[25168.41s -> 25169.05s]  Does anybody have a-
[25169.05s -> 25169.55s]  Dog!
[25182.39s -> 25185.98s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[25185.98s -> 25187.34s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25187.34s -> 25191.50s]  Possibly an organic compound.
[25191.50s -> 25192.30s]  What is that?
[25192.30s -> 25192.80s]  Oh.
[25193.42s -> 25202.74s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[25202.74s -> 25204.17s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25204.17s -> 25206.41s]  Possibly an organic compound.
[25206.41s -> 25209.19s]  What is that?
[25209.19s -> 25209.69s]  Oh.
[25217.42s -> 25217.92s]  That's it.
[25218.70s -> 25219.20s]  Oh.
[25219.58s -> 25220.22s]  That's what happens.
[25220.22s -> 25220.86s]  You say, oh.
[25222.12s -> 25224.04s]  It's NPC dialogue right there.
[25277.85s -> 25279.45s]  I need a new song.
[25281.13s -> 25282.17s]  We gotta get rid of this thing.
[25284.82s -> 25285.54s]  Alien Planet.
[25285.54s -> 25286.10s]  Let's try this.
[25288.31s -> 25288.81s]  Stop.
[25303.27s -> 25307.85s]  You die on me.
[25307.85s -> 25314.50s]  You die on me.
[25314.50s -> 25315.00s]  No!
[25315.00s -> 25317.62s]  You're my co-captain!
[25317.62s -> 25318.66s]  You're my co-pilot!
[25331.78s -> 25333.70s]  Yes, I gotta trim that.
[25333.70s -> 25334.20s]  No!
[25336.97s -> 25339.64s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[25339.64s -> 25340.68s]  Why a creature?
[25340.68s -> 25341.18s]  Why-
[25341.48s -> 25342.60s]  I'm redoing this line.
[25342.60s -> 25343.88s]  I'm redoing that line.
[25343.88s -> 25347.56s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[25347.56s -> 25348.78s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25348.78s -> 25350.54s]  Possibly an organic compound.
[25352.95s -> 25353.75s]  What is that?
[25353.75s -> 25354.25s]  Oh.
[25355.03s -> 25355.51s]  Right here.
[25355.51s -> 25357.03s]  Like, the worst fucking sound you've ever heard.
[25364.09s -> 25370.66s]  That's not the worst.
[25370.66s -> 25371.16s]  That's like a-
[25371.86s -> 25373.37s]  Like a pinball.
[25374.01s -> 25379.34s]  Camera snapshot.
[25381.59s -> 25382.63s]  She's taking a picture.
[25396.09s -> 25397.53s]  That scream is too loud.
[25402.15s -> 25407.29s]  Okay, hold on.
[25407.29s -> 25408.09s]  Let me fix-
[25408.09s -> 25409.13s]  Get some of the audio in here.
[25410.23s -> 25411.27s]  World premiere.
[25414.12s -> 25414.84s]  Don't die on me!
[25415.80s -> 25424.55s]  That was just coughing into their mouth.
[25437.06s -> 25437.56s]  Wait.
[25440.46s -> 25440.96s]  Die!
[25447.85s -> 25448.73s]  That's pretty perfect.
[25452.54s -> 25453.10s]  Die on me!
[25454.49s -> 25454.99s]  Come on!
[25466.76s -> 25467.64s]  Slurp four.
[25476.06s -> 25478.30s]  What are you doing to their mouth?
[25480.54s -> 25481.66s]  Die on me!
[25481.66s -> 25482.33s]  Come on!
[25484.92s -> 25485.88s]  My co-captain!
[25486.90s -> 25487.94s]  You're my co-pilot!
[25517.06s -> 25517.62s]  Die on me!
[25518.26s -> 25518.76s]  Come on!
[25520.31s -> 25520.81s]  No!
[25521.35s -> 25522.31s]  My co-captain!
[25523.03s -> 25524.38s]  You're my co-pilot!
[25537.24s -> 25538.76s]  You're not even doing CPR.
[25538.76s -> 25539.26s]  You're like-
[25540.04s -> 25540.54s]  What are you-
[25546.28s -> 25546.78s]  Okay.
[25547.16s -> 25548.28s]  I think that works pretty well.
[25548.84s -> 25550.76s]  I'm fucking disgusted.
[25554.90s -> 25555.86s]  You're my co-pilot!
[25581.74s -> 25582.78s]  Spit it out.
[25583.82s -> 25585.98s]  It's a slurp and then it's a spit.
[25587.08s -> 25587.58s]  Ugh.
[25604.82s -> 25605.32s]  Should I put-
[25612.65s -> 25614.49s]  What if I did the spit instead?
[25617.08s -> 25618.36s]  The spit in the first-
[25618.36s -> 25618.86s]  You're my co-
[25624.82s -> 25626.02s]  It's hard to control.
[25626.02s -> 25626.52s]  Pilot!
[25655.18s -> 25655.98s]  I can't make-
[25655.98s -> 25656.62s]  I gotta be careful.
[25656.62s -> 25658.06s]  I'm gonna accidentally click on something.
[25658.06s -> 25658.56s]  Come on!
[25678.87s -> 25679.67s]  Does lipstick work?
[25679.67s -> 25680.63s]  The lipstick is working.
[25683.16s -> 25685.16s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[25685.72s -> 25686.68s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25686.68s -> 25687.18s]  It pos-
[25695.26s -> 25695.76s]  What?
[25697.27s -> 25698.23s]  Organic compound.
[25699.43s -> 25701.45s]  No.
[25703.40s -> 25704.92s]  My whole fucking body hurts.
[25711.13s -> 25712.01s]  Thunder clap?
[25713.02s -> 25713.98s]  Oh, Jesus!
[25721.34s -> 25722.38s]  I need like bones.
[25734.73s -> 25735.77s]  Jesus Christ.
[25744.68s -> 25745.40s]  Where is it?
[25745.40s -> 25747.69s]  Um, okay.
[25747.69s -> 25749.45s]  It's human sounds and then it's-
[25749.45s -> 25751.74s]  It's crunching bones.
[25752.38s -> 25753.02s]  I think, right?
[25754.62s -> 25759.06s]  I don't know.
[25762.23s -> 25763.35s]  It's weapon sounds?
[25763.35s -> 25765.03s]  Is it violent sounds?
[25765.03s -> 25765.67s]  It's gone.
[25765.67s -> 25768.07s]  I- I hope I don't have to do any more characters because it's gone.
[25768.71s -> 25769.80s]  I don't have to do any-
[25769.80s -> 25770.92s]  I hope I don't have to do any more.
[25771.48s -> 25772.52s]  Hold on, let me get some water.
[25772.52s -> 25782.20s]  Oh, it's gotta be different than that.
[25782.76s -> 25795.98s]  What is that?
[25797.78s -> 25798.18s]  Should he-
[25798.18s -> 25798.98s]  Should he break out?
[25802.12s -> 25803.08s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25803.08s -> 25803.58s]  It pos-
[25807.34s -> 25808.22s]  What is that?
[25808.22s -> 25808.72s]  Oh.
[25811.05s -> 25812.41s]  You wouldn't hear this?
[25812.41s -> 25813.53s]  How do you not hear this?
[25814.49s -> 25816.66s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature.
[25817.62s -> 25818.58s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25818.58s -> 25820.42s]  It's possibly an organic compound.
[25821.94s -> 25823.46s]  Slowly.
[25823.46s -> 25826.02s]  Slowly breaking through the top of the ceiling.
[25828.73s -> 25829.61s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25829.61s -> 25831.53s]  It's possibly an organic compound.
[25832.25s -> 25834.70s]  What is that?
[25834.70s -> 25835.20s]  Oh.
[25836.46s -> 25846.86s]  Is there any other bone break?
[25846.86s -> 25847.50s]  I need a better-
[25847.50s -> 25848.38s]  A better bone break.
[25858.62s -> 25860.62s]  No, what was the one that I had in the bathtub?
[25862.84s -> 25864.36s]  Yeah, like glass smash.
[25865.48s -> 25866.28s]  Violent sounds.
[25866.28s -> 25867.24s]  No, not an ATM.
[25871.05s -> 25873.37s]  Glass, like, explosion.
[25873.37s -> 25874.25s]  Glass smash.
[25879.66s -> 25882.06s]  Your head is made out of, like, a little porcelain doll.
[25882.06s -> 25882.94s]  Is it gonna be a bigger one?
[25887.54s -> 25888.74s]  How is that violent?
[25888.74s -> 25890.42s]  You just dropped a teacup on the ground.
[25894.54s -> 25895.04s]  What is that?
[25896.30s -> 25897.58s]  That's a Christmas ornament.
[25907.85s -> 25909.77s]  Let me turn off the sound effects.
[25912.20s -> 25913.08s]  Let me put our own in.
[25913.08s -> 25926.36s]  I'm reading a strange creature up here.
[25927.00s -> 25927.96s]  I don't know what it could be.
[25927.96s -> 25929.72s]  It's possibly an organic compound.
[25930.84s -> 25932.20s]  It's a light bulb.
[25932.20s -> 25933.00s]  What is that?
[25933.00s -> 25933.50s]  Oh.
[25934.20s -> 25940.23s]  I think I'm gonna get rid of the camera
[25941.64s -> 25943.40s]  because this is just so anti-climactic.
[25944.36s -> 25949.06s]  What is that?
[25949.06s -> 25949.62s]  Oh.
[25949.62s -> 25954.68s]  No, I gotta get a better one.
[25954.68s -> 25956.10s]  Miscellaneous sounds.
[25958.30s -> 25960.62s]  Fire, lightning, lighting a match,
[25960.62s -> 25963.02s]  door open, dropping a tube, metal crack.
[25965.18s -> 25972.54s]  How about, um, I wish I could preview them.
[25973.10s -> 25974.14s]  That's too bad that you can't.
[25976.50s -> 25981.54s]  Door kick, hit mail, kung fu, mail, punch face, zombie hit.
[25986.10s -> 25987.22s]  Window smash.
[25987.22s -> 25987.78s]  Here we go.
[26006.76s -> 26007.88s]  It syncs pretty well.
[26012.09s -> 26016.92s]  Oh, people taking pictures of him?
[26017.64s -> 26019.99s]  Nah, I got a water right here.
[26019.99s -> 26020.49s]  I'm all right.
[26025.50s -> 26028.97s]  Gonna have the sound effects back on.
[26028.97s -> 26030.25s]  People laughing is good.
[26031.69s -> 26046.22s]  Oh, that's so loud.
[26046.22s -> 26046.70s]  I'm sorry.
[26046.70s -> 26047.50s]  It's really loud.
[26047.50s -> 26048.54s]  Let me turn it down.
[26048.54s -> 26058.22s]  Is that it?
[26058.22s -> 26059.42s]  I don't think I can turn it down.
[26060.46s -> 26060.96s]  Nope.
[26066.26s -> 26067.62s]  There needs to be a break, though.
[26067.62s -> 26069.54s]  Getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[26070.10s -> 26071.22s]  I don't know what it could be.
[26071.22s -> 26072.90s]  Possibly an organic compound.
[26072.90s -> 26074.42s]  The laser is so loud, too.
[26075.38s -> 26076.18s]  What is that?
[26076.18s -> 26076.68s]  Oh.
[26095.66s -> 26101.42s]  It's like the T-Rex.
[26102.14s -> 26102.94s]  No T-Rex.
[26105.85s -> 26108.89s]  Okay, let's go over here.
[26110.25s -> 26112.82s]  What is that?
[26112.82s -> 26113.70s]  Like an eating noise?
[26113.70s -> 26115.54s]  Yeah, like crunch.
[26116.34s -> 26118.02s]  There's gotta be like a big crunch.
[26125.50s -> 26127.26s]  Weapon sounds, violent sounds.
[26127.26s -> 26129.58s]  Like it's not, I can't find anything.
[26129.58s -> 26130.81s]  Bullet body.
[26132.42s -> 26133.94s]  You think it would be bone break, but they're just like,
[26137.14s -> 26139.86s]  they're not, maybe crack knuckles is what it's gonna have to be.
[26146.55s -> 26151.43s]  I mean, that's very violent.
[26152.39s -> 26160.04s]  Okay, what the hell am I gonna do here?
[26160.76s -> 26164.47s]  What am I gonna do here?
[26164.47s -> 26166.07s]  Like squeaks when he's dancing?
[26177.30s -> 26178.90s]  Put Fortnite music in.
[26180.07s -> 26183.67s]  Oh, do not tell me to put in the Fortnite dance music.
[26184.63s -> 26185.13s]  No.
[26185.75s -> 26186.87s]  Oh my god.
[26197.53s -> 26198.03s]  Okay.
[26198.73s -> 26199.29s]  It's going in.
[26199.93s -> 26201.21s]  This guy, I gotta put it in here.
[26201.21s -> 26212.34s]  Where the hell am I gonna get like a wave of the Fortnite song?
[26212.34s -> 26214.50s]  Can I even get a wave of the Fortnite song?
[26216.01s -> 26216.81s]  There has to be somewhere.
[26216.81s -> 26218.49s]  That's the most popular game on Earth.
[26220.79s -> 26228.02s]  Default Fortnite song wave.
[26229.94s -> 26230.90s]  I mean, here it is.
[26252.42s -> 26254.10s]  Just record my phone?
[26256.10s -> 26258.26s]  Oh god damn it.
[26258.26s -> 26260.50s]  I can, all right, I can record my phone.
[26260.50s -> 26270.73s]  You're right.
[26270.73s -> 26272.17s]  Fortnite dance default.
[26275.14s -> 26277.22s]  That's a pretty, yeah, that's a pretty great loophole.
[26277.22s -> 26278.15s]  Here we go.
[26285.19s -> 26287.03s]  How loud can I make this though?
[26287.03s -> 26293.90s]  I can make it pretty loud.
[26325.94s -> 26328.57s]  It has to be louder than that.
[26336.12s -> 26339.16s]  I need to get a, let me get in a little closer.
[26339.16s -> 26340.12s]  You guys are gonna hate this.
[26346.14s -> 26347.90s]  I have to put this really close to the mic.
[26353.85s -> 26355.37s]  Okay, just, here it comes.
[26355.93s -> 26357.93s]  Just turn your volume down for a little bit.
[26357.93s -> 26362.28s]  Okay, here we go.
[26363.00s -> 26365.72s]  Turn your volume down.
[26370.94s -> 26385.38s]  Okay, how much worse does that sound?
[26395.00s -> 26396.20s]  It's gotta be moved a little.
[26397.40s -> 26407.03s]  All right, I'm gonna put it in again.
[26450.86s -> 26452.62s]  I don't like it, but I love it.
[26453.26s -> 26459.54s]  I don't think I even need anything else here.
[26467.24s -> 26468.52s]  It's so fucking loud.
[26468.52s -> 26469.80s]  I can't do anything about it, guys.
[26474.10s -> 26476.66s]  Okay, and then I need explosion, silent,
[26476.66s -> 26478.90s]  and then I need explosion sound here.
[26485.29s -> 26492.81s]  Explosion five.
[26493.77s -> 26496.33s]  This is, why is it so big?
[26497.53s -> 26506.68s]  Explosion one.
[26512.10s -> 26519.83s]  We're gonna change, we'll move the music around too,
[26519.83s -> 26520.55s]  don't worry.
[26520.55s -> 26523.91s]  I'll get to it, don't worry.
[26526.20s -> 26528.34s]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[26528.34s -> 26533.83s]  Oh, these are all like flames.
[26533.83s -> 26537.51s]  I need explosion, explosion, like violent, like boom.
[26537.51s -> 26548.34s]  Let's try, I don't know, cannon.
[26548.34s -> 26550.20s]  Let's try 10.
[26550.84s -> 26552.25s]  This one's quick.
[26553.61s -> 26555.45s]  Is that better?
[26557.91s -> 26559.58s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[26564.98s -> 26566.10s]  And car drive sounds.
[26579.40s -> 26593.82s]  Okay, it works.
[26593.82s -> 26595.40s]  Now what the hell should I put here?
[26596.04s -> 26607.40s]  Okay, here we go.
[26615.38s -> 26616.66s]  Shit, don't touch me.
[26617.30s -> 26619.54s]  I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.
[26622.09s -> 26633.16s]  Don't touch me.
[26633.16s -> 26635.93s]  I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.
[26638.63s -> 26645.80s]  All right, I need like a crash here.
[26665.69s -> 26667.21s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[26667.21s -> 26670.71s]  I gotta, it's when he hits the ground.
[26705.37s -> 26715.03s]  I wish I could just get it to cut off.
[26724.92s -> 26727.64s]  I have to put in like, oh, oh, oh.
[26767.46s -> 26772.34s]  All right, why is this, why is this like George Takei?
[26777.78s -> 26788.81s]  No, I just want like a axe hitting flesh.
[26790.87s -> 26795.16s]  Don't touch me, I'm not gonna be part of your experiments.
[26795.16s -> 26800.74s]  One of these should be way louder.
[26800.74s -> 26801.38s]  Zombie hit?
[26801.38s -> 26806.26s]  I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.
[26809.22s -> 26832.18s]  Okay, we need like a scream here.
[26832.18s -> 26836.78s]  How about, um, sniff?
[26839.62s -> 26842.63s]  No, it's not time for that.
[26842.63s -> 26846.12s]  I will try it in one spot.
[26846.12s -> 26856.94s]  I will try it right here and that's it.
[26856.94s -> 26857.42s]  Where is it?
[26860.42s -> 26871.51s]  You're gonna get this once.
[26871.51s -> 26873.91s]  I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.
[26873.91s -> 26874.79s]  You can't even hear it.
[26911.85s -> 26913.37s]  It's as long as this cut is.
[26924.09s -> 26929.18s]  It's not going in.
[26943.69s -> 26944.49s]  It's out of place.
[26944.49s -> 26945.45s]  The scream is better.
[26949.66s -> 26950.22s]  That's better.
[26963.02s -> 26965.26s]  There is no, I don't know what's happening.
[26969.40s -> 26971.00s]  This needs something else to close this out with.
[27014.79s -> 27016.31s]  Yeah, I gotta change the font here.
[27016.95s -> 27028.47s]  Where's the, oh, there we go.
[27028.47s -> 27029.59s]  That's a pretty good gamer font.
[27046.46s -> 27050.38s]  You don't even know like why,
[27050.38s -> 27052.14s]  I don't even know why he falls off this horse.
[27060.36s -> 27084.60s]  Who even fires a gun to make him fire himself off?
[27084.60s -> 27087.02s]  That's not happening.
[27087.02s -> 27092.34s]  The weapon sounds, I need something better than that.
[27092.34s -> 27093.30s]  Gun shotgun.
[27094.36s -> 27095.56s]  Gun cock shotgun.
[27096.12s -> 27119.77s]  This is better maybe?
[27120.41s -> 27121.45s]  Okay, that's better.
[27134.90s -> 27136.50s]  I need a landing sound too.
[27152.42s -> 27155.03s]  It's the wind knocked out of him.
[27155.83s -> 27170.07s]  All right, fade it out.
[27170.07s -> 27171.83s]  Fade out, fade in.
[27182.73s -> 27184.17s]  Don't worry, I'll fix the music.
[27184.17s -> 27186.18s]  I will get the music all fixed.
[27186.18s -> 27187.38s]  We gotta have some claps here.
[27188.10s -> 27204.66s]  Here comes the next premiere.
[27205.22s -> 27240.39s]  This one's even worse.
[27240.39s -> 27267.74s]  Oh, come on.
[27267.74s -> 27269.18s]  Wait till the N64 filter.
[27269.18s -> 27271.82s]  We will put this through in six months.
[27272.70s -> 27275.32s]  I'm a boomer.
[27275.32s -> 27275.80s]  What do you mean?
[27284.94s -> 27286.86s]  Pre-tech out concept.
[27288.07s -> 27289.19s]  World premiere.
[27289.19s -> 27293.24s]  This doesn't even have a title.
[27293.24s -> 27294.52s]  This is a pre-concept.
[27329.77s -> 27331.05s]  Come on, no.
[27333.16s -> 27359.00s]  Take it from Montdale High School Science Program.
[27359.00s -> 27361.14s]  Why would they need to use that?
[27361.14s -> 27363.70s]  Pre-concept footage used from high school students.
[27368.98s -> 27370.10s]  Yeah, like a different something.
[27370.10s -> 27371.78s]  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27371.78s -> 27373.30s]  I can make this shorter.
[27373.30s -> 27400.09s]  Why can I not make this capital?
[27412.79s -> 27425.21s]  Okay, there we go.
[27443.40s -> 27452.50s]  Is he still wrong?
[27452.50s -> 27453.22s]  I don't care.
[27453.94s -> 27464.68s]  What a terrible pre-concept.
[27465.48s -> 27471.08s]  This is made by high schoolers.
[27471.08s -> 27473.56s]  So it has to have a bunch of fucking dumb noises in it.
[27485.62s -> 27486.66s]  Okay, let me go back.
[27487.30s -> 27489.06s]  And we gotta fix some of the music here.
[27489.06s -> 27506.15s]  What are you gonna do about it?
[27506.15s -> 27507.59s]  I gotta do a better world premiere than that.
[27519.56s -> 27520.20s]  Don't die on me.
[27530.04s -> 27530.76s]  Fuck!
[27530.76s -> 27532.62s]  How do I get rid of it?
[27532.62s -> 27535.42s]  How do I get rid of it?
[27535.42s -> 27536.62s]  How do I get rid of it?
[27536.62s -> 27538.30s]  How do I get rid of it?
[27538.30s -> 27539.34s]  I can't get rid of it.
[27542.98s -> 27544.66s]  He's George Lucas-ing.
[27544.66s -> 27546.26s]  He's, I'm George Lucas-ing.
[27546.26s -> 27547.54s]  You're right, I can't do that.
[27551.88s -> 27553.96s]  That's the most upset I've been in a long time.
[27553.96s -> 27555.32s]  About something that I did.
[27555.32s -> 27566.23s]  Sorry, I got it right here.
[27566.23s -> 27567.74s]  There it is, 19.
[27568.63s -> 27569.13s]  Right?
[27571.72s -> 27572.20s]  Which one is it?
[27572.20s -> 27574.65s]  Dialogue 27.
[27580.25s -> 27581.77s]  Dialogue 27, find it.
[27584.25s -> 27591.67s]  I see it.
[27591.67s -> 27593.51s]  16, where the fuck is it?
[27593.51s -> 27599.19s]  It's right here.
[27599.19s -> 27600.87s]  Dialogue 19, 27.
[27600.87s -> 27610.60s]  Which one am I gonna touch?
[27610.60s -> 27614.47s]  No, not the right one.
[27614.47s -> 27616.22s]  Not the right one.
[27616.22s -> 27617.56s]  I got it.
[27617.56s -> 27618.60s]  It's selected, right?
[27618.60s -> 27619.72s]  That's selected, isn't it?
[27619.72s -> 27621.32s]  If I hit delete, that's selected.
[27621.32s -> 27626.70s]  Dialogue 27 is selected right now.
[27626.70s -> 27627.82s]  Please confirm.
[27627.82s -> 27638.71s]  Did it.
[27638.71s -> 27639.35s]  I got it.
[27639.35s -> 27645.90s]  World premiere.
[27645.90s -> 27649.98s]  Got it.
[27649.98s -> 27651.26s]  Okay, no more George Lucas-ing.
[27651.26s -> 27653.02s]  I need to do music though.
[27653.02s -> 27654.17s]  So right here.
[27655.29s -> 27655.79s]  Oh!
[27657.82s -> 27658.32s]  No!
[27661.06s -> 27663.24s]  Okay, now we're gonna make the music.
[27665.72s -> 27670.50s]  Let's see.
[27670.50s -> 27672.52s]  Action.
[27672.52s -> 27673.32s]  Chrome virus.
[27678.95s -> 27680.31s]  Moonlight romance.
[27680.31s -> 27681.50s]  Fool about.
[27681.50s -> 27682.47s]  Creepy crawly.
[27687.46s -> 27689.14s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature.
[27690.34s -> 27691.86s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[27691.86s -> 27692.90s]  Organic compound.
[27695.30s -> 27696.10s]  What is that?
[27696.10s -> 27696.60s]  Oh.
[27700.60s -> 27723.29s]  I can't.
[27723.29s -> 27723.69s]  Whoa!
[27723.69s -> 27724.33s]  Look at what I'm doing.
[27724.33s -> 27725.05s]  Look at what I'm...
[27725.05s -> 27726.33s]  Holy shit, look what I did.
[27726.33s -> 27731.34s]  But how do I...
[27736.74s -> 27738.10s]  No, stop.
[27738.10s -> 27740.36s]  I just have to have fanfare happen.
[27757.66s -> 27758.46s]  Shit.
[27758.46s -> 27766.25s]  That's a remix.
[27766.89s -> 27770.26s]  Turn this down.
[27776.34s -> 27786.49s]  It's not even like in the right spot now.
[27786.49s -> 27787.21s]  Wait, hold on.
[27806.58s -> 27807.86s]  Jesus Christ!
[27820.84s -> 27833.98s]  It scared me again.
[27834.94s -> 27835.90s]  It scared me again.
[27855.27s -> 27856.42s]  All right, now we need...
[27857.22s -> 27859.54s]  We need like a crazier song here.
[27865.11s -> 27865.75s]  Armageddon.
[27873.05s -> 27874.41s]  Dr. Moore's Evil Lab.
[27874.41s -> 27876.01s]  Let's see what this sounds like.
[27884.55s -> 27886.31s]  No, we gotta have like more action than that.
[27888.94s -> 27889.58s]  Acid Base?
[27890.30s -> 27895.13s]  I don't think Acid Base is not long enough for this.
[27898.95s -> 27901.11s]  What is going on with this fanfare one?
[27901.11s -> 27906.60s]  It's gonna be loud.
[27926.84s -> 27947.91s]  This is a fuck...
[27947.91s -> 27950.07s]  This is an absolute mess.
[27951.05s -> 27952.33s]  This app doesn't...
[27952.33s -> 27954.41s]  I don't even know if I can salvage this last part.
[27958.94s -> 27959.74s]  Fresh sneakers.
[27976.25s -> 27976.73s]  Not bad.
[28010.84s -> 28012.28s]  You need laughs.
[28012.28s -> 28027.91s]  Hold on.
[28027.91s -> 28028.31s]  I can...
[28028.31s -> 28032.92s]  I need a laugh track.
[28032.92s -> 28033.80s]  Because this is you guys...
[28033.80s -> 28034.12s]  You guys...
[28034.12s -> 28037.78s]  This is you guys laughing at the E3 conference.
[28037.78s -> 28042.76s]  I know exactly where I can get a laugh track with my telephone.
[28063.11s -> 28073.29s]  This one's probably better.
[28073.29s -> 28102.82s]  Now lower your volume.
[28102.82s -> 28106.26s]  Let us do the laugh track in the Discord server.
[28106.42s -> 28106.66s]  No.
[28116.25s -> 28117.69s]  You can barely hear it.
[28118.49s -> 28118.97s]  It's like a...
[28119.77s -> 28123.45s]  It's like you're outside of E3 and you can hear this.
[28124.25s -> 28134.36s]  They laugh when the door opens.
[28142.38s -> 28143.66s]  Why is that so funny?
[28144.62s -> 28145.98s]  Just loop them into the...
[28148.70s -> 28150.70s]  Just stack them on top of each other.
[28150.70s -> 28155.58s]  And this is just stupid enough to work.
[28156.14s -> 28186.14s]  I can't tell if this is working or just a waste of time.
[28186.14s -> 28198.73s]  I think it's working.
[28227.85s -> 28228.97s]  Only one.
[28229.77s -> 28234.30s]  It's Doom Eternal.
[28234.30s -> 28238.94s]  Uh-oh.
[28238.94s -> 28239.42s]  Uh-oh.
[28242.78s -> 28243.26s]  Uh-oh.
[28244.14s -> 28248.39s]  I saved it, right?
[28248.39s -> 28249.43s]  Saved it like...
[28249.43s -> 28250.63s]  I saved it pretty good.
[28250.63s -> 28251.19s]  I got it.
[28251.19s -> 28251.67s]  I saved it.
[28253.80s -> 28254.36s]  It's crashed.
[28255.00s -> 28258.01s]  Too many looping Doom Eternals.
[28258.89s -> 28261.85s]  I saved it like less than five, ten minutes ago.
[28264.89s -> 28268.15s]  We didn't have very much shit.
[28273.64s -> 28280.79s]  It's all right.
[28280.79s -> 28282.15s]  When I deleted world premiere.
[28282.87s -> 28284.36s]  Yeah.
[28284.36s -> 28284.92s]  What else?
[28284.92s -> 28285.96s]  I didn't do anything else.
[28285.96s -> 28287.56s]  It wasn't that long ago.
[28288.04s -> 28292.14s]  Yeah, just the music.
[28292.78s -> 28302.39s]  But it's just Creepy Crawler, Acid Base, and Fresh Sneakers.
[28305.67s -> 28307.11s]  I think this is hard locked.
[28313.05s -> 28313.85s]  I can't close it.
[28318.70s -> 28319.26s]  What the hell?
[28321.42s -> 28321.92s]  Uh-oh.
[28323.50s -> 28324.38s]  Hold on.
[28324.38s -> 28324.86s]  Let me just...
[28324.86s -> 28326.54s]  I have to get my task manager open.
[28331.85s -> 28332.17s]  Shit.
[28334.23s -> 28334.47s]  No!
[28336.60s -> 28338.36s]  No, I can't even end the task.
[28341.66s -> 28342.70s]  Come on, please.
[28347.82s -> 28349.02s]  No, it's not over.
[28349.02s -> 28351.74s]  We're so close to being able to be done and watch it.
[28351.74s -> 28354.44s]  This is like four hours in the making.
[28354.44s -> 28364.10s]  I ain't going.
[28364.10s -> 28365.86s]  Let me see if I can pull it from here.
[28368.26s -> 28369.30s]  I can't get it.
[28369.30s -> 28373.50s]  I'm trying to alt tab and hit task manager with alt tab.
[28373.50s -> 28374.86s]  But it's going to my...
[28374.86s -> 28376.06s]  It's still behind.
[28376.06s -> 28376.94s]  It's on my other window.
[28376.94s -> 28377.26s]  It's...
[28377.26s -> 28378.06s]  Oh, shit.
[28378.70s -> 28381.91s]  Come on.
[28382.65s -> 28383.05s]  Delete.
[28384.02s -> 28384.50s]  Come on.
[28386.17s -> 28387.77s]  Don't be completely hard locked here.
[28389.14s -> 28389.62s]  Please.
[28392.39s -> 28393.91s]  Yeah, that did it.
[28393.91s -> 28396.71s]  Task manager, alt tab to see it and then use the arrow keys and then...
[28397.43s -> 28399.11s]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.
[28399.11s -> 28399.51s]  Delete.
[28400.23s -> 28402.49s]  I got the mouse.
[28402.49s -> 28403.21s]  I can click the X.
[28403.21s -> 28404.17s]  It's just not doing anything.
[28415.48s -> 28416.92s]  Because I can close the other ones.
[28417.56s -> 28422.94s]  Windows tab and make a new window in the top left.
[28423.58s -> 28429.64s]  Is there anybody that I can open the task manager to my other monitors?
[28430.20s -> 28435.88s]  You know what I'm saying?
[28436.52s -> 28440.31s]  How do I do that?
[28442.41s -> 28443.85s]  Windows key plus tab.
[28444.41s -> 28447.27s]  Okay.
[28447.83s -> 28459.75s]  Okay, I got the task manager open, but I just can't use it.
[28459.75s -> 28465.99s]  Task manager.
[28465.99s -> 28468.15s]  Ah, it looked like it was going to do it for a second.
[28468.15s -> 28481.58s]  I can't like drag it.
[28481.58s -> 28486.62s]  Always on top task manager.
[28486.62s -> 28490.09s]  I don't know why mine's not up there like that.
[28490.09s -> 28491.45s]  Windows key and left arrow.
[28496.12s -> 28496.92s]  New desktop.
[28499.77s -> 28504.04s]  New desktop.
[28504.04s -> 28505.40s]  Wait, desktop one.
[28506.41s -> 28507.61s]  What the hell did I just do?
[28508.33s -> 28511.99s]  Hello?
[28512.73s -> 28515.35s]  I don't see anybody.
[28515.35s -> 28519.32s]  I'm on a new desktop.
[28519.32s -> 28520.84s]  I have no OBS.
[28520.84s -> 28521.24s]  I have...
[28521.24s -> 28526.09s]  What happened?
[28526.09s -> 28528.70s]  No, I was just in...
[28528.70s -> 28533.91s]  I was just there.
[28533.91s -> 28534.63s]  All right, I'm back.
[28534.63s -> 28534.87s]  I'm back.
[28534.87s -> 28535.27s]  I'm back.
[28535.27s -> 28536.39s]  So I did new desktop.
[28536.39s -> 28538.71s]  I tried to open task manager on the new desktop and I can't...
[28538.71s -> 28544.89s]  I couldn't do it because I'm new desktop.
[28544.89s -> 28552.01s]  Task manager in the new desktop.
[28552.01s -> 28552.49s]  I'm here.
[28552.49s -> 28552.89s]  I'm here.
[28553.45s -> 28553.85s]  I'm here.
[28558.50s -> 28568.18s]  The first task manager is currently closed.
[28568.18s -> 28570.02s]  Right click on the bottom bar and new desktop.
[28570.02s -> 28571.54s]  Click task manager.
[28571.54s -> 28573.03s]  All right, I'm going to try it again.
[28573.03s -> 28574.84s]  Wish me luck.
[28574.84s -> 28575.56s]  New desktop.
[28576.81s -> 28577.13s]  Okay.
[28577.69s -> 28581.54s]  I'm trying...
[28581.54s -> 28583.38s]  Okay, task manager.
[28584.26s -> 28584.74s]  I got it.
[28585.30s -> 28589.32s]  You guys are so smart.
[28594.70s -> 28595.66s]  End task.
[28595.66s -> 28596.22s]  Got it.
[28596.22s -> 28596.70s]  We're good.
[28598.58s -> 28600.34s]  You guys are seriously fucking so smart.
[28602.74s -> 28603.14s]  We're back.
[28604.25s -> 28605.77s]  All right, let's open it back up.
[28605.77s -> 28610.07s]  What would I do without you guys?
[28611.27s -> 28612.07s]  I don't know.
[28612.07s -> 28614.04s]  What would I do without you?
[28614.52s -> 28621.91s]  I'm...
[28621.91s -> 28622.87s]  We're getting to the end of this.
[28622.87s -> 28624.31s]  I'm finishing this tonight.
[28624.31s -> 28625.82s]  Because I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[28631.13s -> 28631.53s]  Let's go.
[28632.09s -> 28636.87s]  Uh-oh.
[28636.87s -> 28642.68s]  The movie stunts and effects was not closed properly the last time you used it.
[28642.68s -> 28650.82s]  If it fails to run, you can look for a solution in the readme file.
[28650.82s -> 28651.30s]  Uh-oh.
[28655.13s -> 28655.53s]  Okay.
[28660.31s -> 28660.87s]  Please open.
[28661.43s -> 28663.59s]  It opened.
[28663.59s -> 28666.82s]  Can you see it?
[28670.34s -> 28671.14s]  Back in action.
[28671.14s -> 28672.02s]  It's gonna be really loud.
[28672.02s -> 28673.06s]  Turn your volume down.
[28673.06s -> 28674.18s]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[28674.18s -> 28675.22s]  Turn your volume down now.
[28675.22s -> 28683.59s]  The menu here is 10 times louder than the game.
[28683.59s -> 28683.99s]  Warning.
[28684.71s -> 28686.23s]  Oh, this isn't even that bad.
[28686.23s -> 28686.95s]  Okay, game.
[28688.14s -> 28688.94s]  Load game.
[28691.88s -> 28693.48s]  We were here, right?
[28694.20s -> 28695.40s]  2130...
[28695.40s -> 28695.72s]  Wait, what?
[28695.72s -> 28696.52s]  Pee Pants 2.
[28697.32s -> 28701.05s]  Yeah, it's this one here.
[28701.69s -> 28705.67s]  My ear...
[28705.67s -> 28705.91s]  I thought...
[28705.91s -> 28707.11s]  I really thought it was gonna be really loud.
[28707.83s -> 28708.39s]  Usually is.
[28711.40s -> 28712.44s]  Auto save or pee...
[28712.44s -> 28713.24s]  No, Pee Pants 2.
[28715.91s -> 28717.83s]  You'll have to save this game in 2001.
[28718.63s -> 28719.03s]  I know.
[28719.59s -> 28724.66s]  Here we go.
[28738.68s -> 28739.24s]  Um, wait.
[28740.36s -> 28740.60s]  What?
[28743.40s -> 28743.88s]  Wait a minute.
[28747.59s -> 28748.31s]  No, no, no.
[28748.87s -> 28750.31s]  I saved it.
[28751.54s -> 28753.46s]  I saved like making the video.
[28753.46s -> 28754.10s]  Making the movie.
[28754.82s -> 28758.68s]  I think I have to be like in the post-production menu, probably?
[28760.82s -> 28761.14s]  Yeah.
[28765.21s -> 28766.17s]  Just go into the movie.
[28766.17s -> 28766.65s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28766.65s -> 28767.53s]  We just gotta...
[28767.53s -> 28768.97s]  We just gotta go into um...
[28769.77s -> 28770.25s]  Into where?
[28773.88s -> 28774.92s]  Can I get there from here?
[28780.28s -> 28781.56s]  Post-production.
[28781.56s -> 28782.52s]  Should I just drag it in there?
[28787.50s -> 28788.62s]  Pee 3 cancel.
[28788.62s -> 28789.50s]  What is the point?
[28789.50s -> 28791.02s]  I just gotta get into post-production, right?
[28795.50s -> 28797.42s]  I am so scared to just hit shoot this.
[28802.94s -> 28803.26s]  No.
[28803.98s -> 28804.30s]  No.
[28804.30s -> 28805.74s]  I was very clear.
[28815.61s -> 28816.49s]  It has to be saved.
[28816.49s -> 28818.49s]  Yeah, I mean why would they have a save feature there?
[28826.52s -> 28827.24s]  Well, it's...
[28830.47s -> 28831.11s]  Load game.
[28836.41s -> 28836.65s]  No.
[28837.21s -> 28842.23s]  The autosave?
[28842.23s -> 28842.47s]  No.
[28843.11s -> 28845.75s]  This is like the save file.
[28845.75s -> 28850.47s]  The file should be in the game folder.
[28850.47s -> 28851.35s]  Yeah, let me just...
[28851.35s -> 28851.91s]  Let me just...
[28852.79s -> 28856.82s]  Let me just get into like the editor and try to open it.
[28860.20s -> 28864.07s]  Let me like just shoot this and then get into the editor.
[28864.07s -> 28869.35s]  That's very sad if that's the case.
[28871.54s -> 28873.86s]  Just get it into post-production and then open up from there.
[28874.58s -> 28875.82s]  It has to be there.
[28876.38s -> 28889.70s]  Do not override it.
[28893.16s -> 28895.32s]  Yeah, just bring it to post, right?
[28899.50s -> 28899.82s]  Before...
[28899.82s -> 28900.38s]  Let me just...
[28900.38s -> 28901.26s]  Hold on just a second.
[28901.26s -> 28902.14s]  Let me do something here.
[28903.16s -> 28906.76s]  I'm gonna go into the save files and just like copy the one that's there right now.
[28912.50s -> 28913.22s]  Hold on a second.
[28913.78s -> 28917.43s]  Where would that be?
[28918.23s -> 28922.39s]  Like just in case it overwrites it or something.
[28924.17s -> 28924.81s]  Let's go to...
[28925.61s -> 28926.81s]  It's in my documents, right?
[28927.61s -> 28937.94s]  Movies.
[28938.82s -> 28939.38s]  Movies.
[28940.58s -> 28942.74s]  E3 presentation is in here.
[28945.22s -> 28945.70s]  I see it.
[28955.74s -> 28959.90s]  It was modified at 1139 p.m.
[28963.08s -> 28964.60s]  It's a configuration file.
[28965.16s -> 28969.82s]  I'm going to copy both of these.
[28970.54s -> 28976.55s]  There's E3 presentation and E3presentation.trl.
[28977.11s -> 28980.49s]  And I'm gonna just paste them over here.
[28980.49s -> 28981.77s]  I'm just gonna have them.
[28981.77s -> 28988.31s]  There's also a couple of these.
[28988.31s -> 28990.63s]  I'm just gonna copy these as well just in case something horrible happens.
[28991.27s -> 28994.73s]  And then I get...
[28994.73s -> 28996.01s]  I see get out of town here as well.
[28996.01s -> 28996.33s]  All right.
[28996.33s -> 28998.73s]  E3 presentation, configuration, movies.
[28998.73s -> 28999.77s]  Let me just check the other ones.
[29000.65s -> 29001.85s]  Movie sounds.
[29001.85s -> 29002.65s]  They're still in there.
[29004.81s -> 29005.61s]  Saved games.
[29007.29s -> 29008.01s]  Okay.
[29008.01s -> 29010.73s]  But these are saved games and not configuration files.
[29012.18s -> 29015.22s]  I have my E3 presentation config file here.
[29015.94s -> 29021.16s]  Cross your fingers.
[29021.16s -> 29024.31s]  Because we're gonna just...
[29024.31s -> 29025.35s]  I'm gonna put it into post-production.
[29025.35s -> 29028.55s]  See what happens.
[29028.55s -> 29029.19s]  I got the...
[29029.19s -> 29029.99s]  Everything's backed up.
[29030.55s -> 29034.23s]  Let's try to...
[29034.23s -> 29035.43s]  Let's see what happens.
[29035.43s -> 29046.78s]  Can you go into post-production from the main menu?
[29046.78s -> 29047.42s]  I don't think you can.
[29049.59s -> 29050.57s]  Here we go.
[29057.64s -> 29059.64s]  Here we go.
[29084.47s -> 29085.03s]  That's not...
[29085.03s -> 29085.35s]  I can't...
[29085.99s -> 29086.47s]  Wait.
[29086.47s -> 29087.91s]  Whoa, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[29088.55s -> 29090.07s]  It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here.
[29090.07s -> 29090.39s]  It's here.
[29090.39s -> 29091.11s]  This is it.
[29091.11s -> 29094.90s]  It's here.
[29094.90s -> 29095.30s]  It's fine.
[29095.30s -> 29096.10s]  Everything's done.
[29096.10s -> 29098.84s]  The whole item was just...
[29098.84s -> 29100.92s]  Item was died.
[29100.92s -> 29107.53s]  For a second, I was so depressed because I thought that was load.
[29107.53s -> 29107.85s]  Okay.
[29107.85s -> 29108.97s]  So where do we leave off?
[29118.34s -> 29119.54s]  Something's not right.
[29119.54s -> 29125.86s]  Something's not right, guys.
[29129.02s -> 29131.00s]  These are off somehow.
[29131.00s -> 29144.17s]  I think the cuts are all gone.
[29144.17s -> 29156.92s]  Are they all gone?
[29156.92s -> 29157.88s]  No, they're not.
[29157.88s -> 29158.76s]  Are they?
[29158.76s -> 29161.66s]  Yeah, they are.
[29161.66s -> 29162.94s]  All the edits are gone.
[29162.94s -> 29169.46s]  Because this was not over here.
[29169.46s -> 29176.42s]  This is gonna screw up everything.
[29176.98s -> 29179.46s]  Because I have to edit it again.
[29182.01s -> 29191.38s]  If it was saved, though, why wouldn't I be able to pull it from here?
[29191.38s -> 29192.82s]  I lost a half an hour of progress?
[29193.38s -> 29194.58s]  Nah, but this...
[29196.22s -> 29198.38s]  Some of these clips, especially like this one here...
[29199.18s -> 29199.98s]  Like, see, look at this.
[29199.98s -> 29200.38s]  This was...
[29200.94s -> 29201.98s]  I put these over there.
[29201.98s -> 29203.10s]  I did this the first thing I did.
[29208.46s -> 29210.38s]  Go to main menu and post-production.
[29210.38s -> 29210.86s]  I'll try it.
[29211.82s -> 29212.46s]  Main menu?
[29213.18s -> 29218.44s]  Can I get that from the main menu?
[29220.60s -> 29222.20s]  I can't load it from here, unfortunately.
[29222.20s -> 29222.92s]  It's just pulling it.
[29223.64s -> 29227.74s]  The audio is here, but I'm gonna edit this and it's gonna get screwed up.
[29232.60s -> 29233.40s]  Is there a way...
[29234.12s -> 29237.85s]  Let's just see.
[29237.85s -> 29238.73s]  Hold on, just get out.
[29240.01s -> 29240.57s]  Main menu.
[29241.69s -> 29242.41s]  See if I can...
[29242.41s -> 29243.61s]  No, don't save the current game.
[29245.80s -> 29246.60s]  Movie player?
[29267.83s -> 29268.95s]  No, the cuts aren't here.
[29275.61s -> 29276.81s]  Maybe I can't reshoot it.
[29278.86s -> 29279.90s]  Let's do this then.
[29279.90s -> 29281.02s]  I'm gonna reload my save.
[29288.23s -> 29289.99s]  Nah, those are the only config files that are in there.
[29295.72s -> 29296.84s]  Swap out the movie files?
[29297.48s -> 29301.29s]  You're talking about the ones that I...
[29301.29s -> 29302.41s]  Oh yeah, let's do this.
[29303.05s -> 29305.91s]  Let's try this.
[29307.24s -> 29311.29s]  So it's because I've shot the movie, maybe.
[29311.29s -> 29314.70s]  So technically, let's just see.
[29314.70s -> 29319.29s]  So I have these, the presentation and the TRL both saved here.
[29319.29s -> 29323.82s]  I'm gonna paste these back in and I'm not gonna reshoot it.
[29323.82s -> 29326.30s]  I'm literally just gonna paste these back and then go to the movie player.
[29329.70s -> 29330.10s]  Damn it.
[29331.22s -> 29334.34s]  I'm like, annoyed by this, but like at the same time.
[29335.06s -> 29336.15s]  I don't know.
[29336.15s -> 29337.59s]  That just like sucks, but whatever.
[29338.39s -> 29339.27s]  But hopefully this works.
[29342.15s -> 29343.03s]  Oh, let's go...
[29344.07s -> 29348.14s]  I wish we could have seen the whole thing.
[29350.74s -> 29351.54s]  I still could do it.
[29351.54s -> 29353.30s]  I still could do it, but let's just try this.
[29355.45s -> 29359.80s]  Let's go back to my documents.
[29359.80s -> 29361.56s]  Go to the movies.
[29362.36s -> 29364.66s]  This would be a good indicator here.
[29365.70s -> 29373.98s]  If E3 presentation is 30 kilobytes and 132 kilobytes for what's in there now,
[29375.61s -> 29376.49s]  what is it over here?
[29376.49s -> 29377.77s]  I just like burped internally.
[29381.66s -> 29383.34s]  I wonder if this will change.
[29385.72s -> 29388.60s]  All right, guys, guys, we have a...
[29388.60s -> 29400.44s]  Guys, I think this is gonna work because they're different file sizes.
[29400.44s -> 29401.88s]  They're different file sizes.
[29401.88s -> 29404.52s]  If this works, oh, I'm gonna pee with such joy.
[29404.52s -> 29405.16s]  Come on, they're different.
[29405.16s -> 29406.20s]  They're not the same size.
[29406.20s -> 29407.48s]  That has to mean something.
[29407.48s -> 29409.27s]  Okay, here we go.
[29409.27s -> 29411.26s]  I'm gonna paste them in here.
[29411.26s -> 29412.62s]  I have the originals right here.
[29413.18s -> 29416.31s]  Paste them in, replace the files.
[29418.10s -> 29419.14s]  Yeah, they're different files.
[29419.14s -> 29420.42s]  They're fucking different file sizes.
[29420.42s -> 29421.30s]  It has to mean something.
[29421.30s -> 29421.62s]  Let's go.
[29422.26s -> 29423.91s]  Here we go.
[29423.91s -> 29431.46s]  Oh, wait, I have to...
[29436.06s -> 29438.14s]  Compact file means there's less data,
[29438.14s -> 29441.26s]  which means that makes sense because I was cutting things, right?
[29441.99s -> 29442.39s]  Right?
[29442.95s -> 29443.99s]  Please tell me that's right.
[29451.67s -> 29452.55s]  Let's see what happens.
[29452.55s -> 29453.51s]  Here we go.
[29453.51s -> 29462.95s]  So just from here, we're gonna go to the movie player.
[29463.67s -> 29466.66s]  I'm a CS student.
[29466.66s -> 29468.18s]  That's 100% correct.
[29468.18s -> 29475.43s]  Let's hope so.
[29475.43s -> 29476.57s]  Movie player.
[29502.02s -> 29502.90s]  What is this?
[29502.90s -> 29503.22s]  Load.
[29520.14s -> 29521.18s]  No, none of the cuts are here.
[29521.90s -> 29533.34s]  Because there was so many cuts that I did just to clean everything up.
[29533.34s -> 29536.95s]  Oh, no, like this is...
[29537.59s -> 29538.15s]  Let's just see.
[29538.15s -> 29538.47s]  Hold on.
[29540.47s -> 29541.03s]  Yeah, see?
[29542.15s -> 29543.35s]  I did a lot of...
[29544.15s -> 29547.51s]  It's time to cut.
[29547.51s -> 29549.83s]  If I remember where I cut everything,
[29550.55s -> 29552.31s]  it should line up in the same place.
[29552.95s -> 29558.62s]  I just don't remember everything.
[29559.66s -> 29560.62s]  Why is there a ghost here?
[29560.62s -> 29560.86s]  No.
[29563.46s -> 29564.66s]  Speed run the movie?
[29564.66s -> 29566.26s]  I'm so disappointed right now.
[29567.08s -> 29567.96s]  I still have the audio.
[29567.96s -> 29568.60s]  I still have the...
[29570.20s -> 29576.38s]  I don't remember where everything was.
[29581.78s -> 29582.82s]  That still fits.
[29583.38s -> 29584.26s]  That's still...
[29584.26s -> 29585.06s]  All right.
[29585.06s -> 29585.86s]  This is still okay.
[29586.66s -> 29587.46s]  What's not okay?
[29590.49s -> 29590.97s]  Wait, what?
[29594.49s -> 29595.37s]  Why is that back?
[29596.09s -> 29597.61s]  I saved right after doing this.
[29601.80s -> 29603.88s]  I think this whole thing is fucked up.
[29606.14s -> 29608.54s]  It was right before, but where are the cuts then?
[29610.10s -> 29611.78s]  Am I insane or are they here?
[29620.82s -> 29621.54s]  Don't die on me.
[29622.18s -> 29626.22s]  You die on me.
[29626.22s -> 29627.02s]  Come on.
[29629.61s -> 29630.57s]  My co-captain.
[29631.37s -> 29632.65s]  You were my co-pilot.
[29633.61s -> 29639.06s]  Okay, I think it's still salvageable.
[29646.78s -> 29648.94s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[29648.94s -> 29649.82s]  No, the cuts are...
[29651.42s -> 29652.86s]  That was the big kicker here.
[29652.86s -> 29654.06s]  I cut it here, remember?
[29660.90s -> 29662.18s]  I'm just gonna go for it.
[29662.18s -> 29662.90s]  I'm going for it.
[29667.61s -> 29668.25s]  Now, because look.
[29668.25s -> 29669.05s]  Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[29669.05s -> 29670.09s]  That's not the right place to cut.
[29670.09s -> 29671.13s]  It's over here.
[29671.13s -> 29674.78s]  This might actually save the whole thing.
[29675.34s -> 29679.94s]  Where was it?
[29679.94s -> 29682.12s]  It was like right here, right?
[29686.76s -> 29688.28s]  I'm not gonna get this exact, but...
[29688.68s -> 29690.12s]  Because then he crashes through.
[29690.76s -> 29698.71s]  Let's just do this.
[29698.71s -> 29699.43s]  I know it's like...
[29700.07s -> 29707.83s]  Because then the whole thing shrinks down.
[29707.83s -> 29716.62s]  It could be, it possibly could be...
[29722.60s -> 29724.04s]  I'm getting a read...
[29724.04s -> 29724.92s]  This cuts here.
[29730.92s -> 29733.40s]  Getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[29733.40s -> 29734.28s]  I don't know what it could be.
[29734.28s -> 29736.20s]  It could possibly be an organic compound.
[29738.65s -> 29739.15s]  What is that?
[29741.75s -> 29742.25s]  It's close.
[29746.97s -> 29748.73s]  It was right here, I think.
[29750.47s -> 29751.67s]  Right before he puts his hand on his chin.
[29758.34s -> 29758.84s]  No!
[29761.00s -> 29766.09s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[29766.09s -> 29767.13s]  It doesn't matter.
[29767.13s -> 29767.63s]  It's okay.
[29770.11s -> 29774.91s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[29774.91s -> 29776.43s]  We can have some messed up parts.
[29776.43s -> 29778.59s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[29778.59s -> 29779.95s]  I don't know what it could be.
[29779.95s -> 29781.63s]  Possibly an organic compound.
[29784.09s -> 29784.59s]  What is that?
[29787.48s -> 29789.96s]  It's progress, but it's gonna take a lot of time.
[29790.68s -> 29792.04s]  Damn it.
[29792.04s -> 29795.80s]  It's still off a little.
[29795.80s -> 29796.52s]  I had it so...
[29797.50s -> 29799.90s]  The stupid clown laughing.
[29799.90s -> 29800.40s]  Shit.
[29801.38s -> 29802.26s]  What is that?
[29802.26s -> 29803.86s]  Let me see if this whole thing's screwed up now.
[29811.38s -> 29813.14s]  It's just so off.
[29815.15s -> 29815.79s]  That it's...
[29816.35s -> 29817.63s]  I'm like working backwards.
[29822.77s -> 29823.49s]  I'm depressed.
[29826.05s -> 29827.73s]  Because I was about to like get this done.
[29827.73s -> 29828.53s]  And now it's like...
[29834.02s -> 29838.93s]  The kind of steam has left the engine here, unfortunately.
[29846.27s -> 29847.39s]  It's definitely fixable.
[29857.31s -> 29857.79s]  I'm so...
[29860.22s -> 29861.58s]  Like salty's not like mad.
[29861.58s -> 29862.54s]  It's not even the right word.
[29863.42s -> 29865.55s]  Let me just go back and load it again.
[29866.19s -> 29868.14s]  I need to see it again.
[29872.24s -> 29872.74s]  Why?
[29873.73s -> 29874.29s]  Why?
[29874.29s -> 29874.69s]  Why?
[29874.69s -> 29875.25s]  Why?
[29875.25s -> 29876.29s]  This never happened before.
[29876.29s -> 29877.57s]  I've played this game before too.
[29885.14s -> 29885.94s]  I'm getting a reading.
[29890.51s -> 29896.16s]  You need to rest.
[29898.48s -> 29899.68s]  I'm so unfulfilled.
[29899.68s -> 29901.84s]  This has been like such a long time coming.
[29901.84s -> 29903.84s]  I'm not fulfilled at all.
[29906.75s -> 29908.43s]  Don't stack 10 laugh tracks.
[29908.43s -> 29910.91s]  Yeah, but how would I have known that that was gonna break everything?
[29912.42s -> 29913.46s]  I would never have known that.
[29914.02s -> 29915.30s]  And I was saving it too.
[29915.30s -> 29916.34s]  So it's not like I...
[29916.34s -> 29918.82s]  I mean if a game crashes, you would assume.
[29918.82s -> 29924.75s]  I think it's...
[29924.75s -> 29925.55s]  Where is it?
[29925.55s -> 29926.51s]  Right before...
[29927.55s -> 29928.35s]  Or right after.
[29929.07s -> 29937.78s]  Where the audio starts with each clip, you know where to start.
[29937.78s -> 29940.18s]  Yeah, but the problem is if I cut right here...
[29942.37s -> 29943.25s]  This is just...
[29943.25s -> 29945.09s]  I did all this before putting in the audio.
[29945.09s -> 29945.49s]  And when you...
[29945.49s -> 29947.41s]  Every time you trim something, it moves everything.
[29949.89s -> 29951.73s]  You use the vase to see the exact timing.
[29952.53s -> 29952.85s]  Here...
[29952.85s -> 29953.17s]  All right.
[29953.17s -> 29954.37s]  Here's what's gonna happen with this.
[29955.79s -> 29956.35s]  Here's the deal.
[29957.07s -> 29957.57s]  Okay.
[29959.42s -> 29959.82s]  I'm gonna...
[29959.82s -> 29965.25s]  Because I'm playing this again with mods, I'm going to...
[29965.25s -> 29965.89s]  Off stream.
[29966.86s -> 29968.38s]  I am going to finish this.
[29969.18s -> 29969.74s]  Off stream.
[29970.30s -> 29972.29s]  I'm gonna sleep.
[29972.29s -> 29973.01s]  I'll come back to it.
[29973.01s -> 29974.69s]  I'm gonna finish this one off stream.
[29974.69s -> 29975.81s]  Have it done to watch.
[29979.09s -> 29979.65s]  Because you...
[29980.29s -> 29980.85s]  It was done.
[29980.85s -> 29981.97s]  It was like pretty much done.
[29981.97s -> 29983.33s]  There's like a little bit left.
[29983.33s -> 29985.25s]  It's like this portion here.
[29985.25s -> 29988.26s]  And there's this tiny little portion over here.
[29988.26s -> 29991.70s]  So because it's just getting late, then I'm not gonna lie.
[29991.70s -> 29993.54s]  I'm a little disappointed.
[29993.54s -> 29997.97s]  But we will watch this one on the next movie stream.
[29998.53s -> 30002.13s]  Because that means that I can get out of the default ones
[30002.13s -> 30005.01s]  and we can get all the weird characters and all the new props and all the new stuff.
[30005.65s -> 30008.85s]  We'll open with this one.
[30008.85s -> 30011.33s]  And then that'll be good because maybe the people that weren't here
[30011.33s -> 30016.43s]  for this stream could just enjoy the three to four or five hours
[30016.43s -> 30017.31s]  that it took to make this one.
[30017.31s -> 30018.27s]  You know what I'm saying?
[30018.27s -> 30021.60s]  I think that's the best plan.
[30021.60s -> 30026.03s]  Because we are going on eight and a half hours here.
[30026.03s -> 30031.78s]  So the plan here is I am off tomorrow.
[30032.42s -> 30034.90s]  I have to make a few phone calls tomorrow.
[30034.90s -> 30036.50s]  I think they're going to be lengthy.
[30036.50s -> 30038.70s]  I can't really stream tomorrow.
[30038.70s -> 30044.14s]  Tuesday or Wednesday, depending, either depends on when Star is around.
[30044.14s -> 30050.24s]  Star and I are going to play Deep Rock Galactic together
[30050.24s -> 30052.43s]  on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
[30052.43s -> 30056.03s]  And whatever day that we do that, you know,
[30056.03s -> 30060.05s]  the movies mod stream will be the other day.
[30060.05s -> 30062.13s]  So Tuesday is probably the day we're going to do it.
[30062.13s -> 30065.73s]  Wednesday will be the new movies one or flip it around.
[30065.73s -> 30066.37s]  We'll see.
[30066.37s -> 30070.88s]  But that's the plan for the next two streams.
[30070.88s -> 30073.70s]  So that's where I have to call it.
[30073.70s -> 30076.50s]  I'm sorry, everybody.
[30076.50s -> 30078.26s]  Kind of a all over the place stream.
[30078.26s -> 30086.00s]  But I've laughed harder than I fucking have in a long time.
[30086.00s -> 30087.52s]  This game is fucking hilarious.
[30087.52s -> 30090.16s]  It's kind of buggy and broken as some of the stuff could be.
[30090.16s -> 30095.47s]  I got at least like 45 minutes of straight laughing.
[30095.47s -> 30101.31s]  So I hope you enjoyed it, too.
[30101.31s -> 30102.03s]  We will come back.
[30103.39s -> 30104.67s]  Batman is a character.
[30104.67s -> 30106.78s]  We're going to do like a Batman one.
[30106.78s -> 30108.86s]  I'll be honest with you here.
[30108.86s -> 30115.23s]  I might make a couple more to show just so you can see them
[30115.23s -> 30118.86s]  without knowing what they are just before we get started
[30118.86s -> 30121.89s]  on the other ones to get.
[30121.89s -> 30124.21s]  I kind of want to get some more experience in it.
[30124.21s -> 30125.98s]  Maybe I'll just hang out up here tomorrow
[30125.98s -> 30129.74s]  and just like chill and make a couple.
[30129.74s -> 30131.22s]  We'll see.
[30131.22s -> 30133.57s]  But thanks for watching, everybody.
[30133.57s -> 30135.65s]  If you're I mean, I'm going to save it.
[30135.65s -> 30136.05s]  It's all right.
[30136.05s -> 30137.01s]  I got the files.
[30137.57s -> 30145.41s]  I'm just going to go through this on my own.
[30145.41s -> 30147.01s]  So it's already saved.
[30147.01s -> 30153.06s]  Yeah, I'm going to go back to the VOD
[30153.06s -> 30155.38s]  and find like the little exact points to cut.
[30155.38s -> 30157.10s]  But that's like painstaking.
[30157.10s -> 30160.35s]  I got to like all tab and go and move and get.
[30160.35s -> 30161.89s]  You don't want to be here for that.
[30161.89s -> 30163.33s]  That's really boring.
[30163.33s -> 30165.81s]  I don't think I want to put everybody through that,
[30165.81s -> 30169.73s]  especially after putting you through what I would assume
[30169.73s -> 30173.28s]  was like 40 straight minutes of trying to figure out
[30173.28s -> 30175.28s]  how to get everything to work correctly.
[30175.28s -> 30178.38s]  So I do apologize again for that.
[30178.38s -> 30182.22s]  But that's where the end of the stream is going to happen.
[30182.22s -> 30184.19s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[30184.19s -> 30190.13s]  Thanks again if you came from Joel's stream.
[30190.13s -> 30193.90s]  Joel, thanks for the raid again.
[30193.90s -> 30197.28s]  Yeah, I can watch it on like an iPad or phone or something.
[30197.28s -> 30197.76s]  I'll get it.
[30197.76s -> 30198.64s]  I'll get it.
[30198.64s -> 30199.36s]  I'll get it.
[30199.36s -> 30206.14s]  I need to do this.
[30206.86s -> 30211.30s]  Hey, look at that.
[30211.30s -> 30212.90s]  So pardon me while I'm going to pee.
[30213.70s -> 30214.10s]  I'll come back.
[30214.10s -> 30214.74s]  We'll do the bits.
[30220.45s -> 30221.97s]  The bits on another desktop.
[30222.53s -> 30227.87s]  I think the bits are on a different desktop than this.
[30229.66s -> 30230.14s]  Are they?
[30230.78s -> 30234.54s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[30234.54s -> 30234.94s]  I got them.
[30234.94s -> 30235.26s]  I got them.
[30235.26s -> 30235.90s]  Okay.
[30235.90s -> 30239.57s]  All right.
[30239.57s -> 30240.13s]  I'll be right back.
[30240.13s -> 30240.85s]  I'm going to pee.
[30241.73s -> 30242.93s]  And we will close this out.
[30243.49s -> 30245.20s]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[30245.20s -> 30245.68s]  Be right back.
[30363.78s -> 30364.42s]  All right, I'm back.
[30365.22s -> 30371.55s]  So let's go back to earlier.
[30375.74s -> 30379.31s]  We had this is eight hours ago.
[30379.31s -> 30380.03s]  Long time ago.
[30380.59s -> 30381.73s]  Curly snail.
[30381.73s -> 30382.85s]  Thanks for five dollars.
[30382.85s -> 30384.64s]  It's been a while.
[30384.64s -> 30385.44s]  Take my money.
[30385.44s -> 30390.88s]  We'll gladly take anything that you give me.
[30391.95s -> 30392.35s]  Thank you.
[30392.35s -> 30393.31s]  I really appreciate it.
[30394.56s -> 30396.50s]  Thank you.
[30396.50s -> 30399.62s]  Also, we had ten dollars from Reaper's Reviews.
[30399.62s -> 30400.50s]  Just no message.
[30400.50s -> 30401.06s]  Ten dollars.
[30401.70s -> 30402.90s]  Thank you, Reaper's Reviews.
[30403.78s -> 30405.98s]  Ten bucks coming in.
[30406.54s -> 30407.26s]  Really appreciate it.
[30408.30s -> 30409.10s]  Nile Orion.
[30409.10s -> 30409.82s]  Thanks for three bucks.
[30409.82s -> 30410.62s]  Great value.
[30410.62s -> 30411.58s]  Jex for next.
[30411.58s -> 30412.30s]  Jerma Rumble.
[30420.83s -> 30422.35s]  That would be pretty funny, actually.
[30422.91s -> 30424.75s]  I want to start working on that, too.
[30424.75s -> 30425.55s]  It's been long enough.
[30426.19s -> 30430.99s]  There's a lot of things I want to just do.
[30431.71s -> 30436.75s]  But thank you, Nile Orion.
[30438.96s -> 30439.92s]  Yes is online.
[30439.92s -> 30440.96s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[30440.96s -> 30444.72s]  Turns out I completely forgot I made this green screen video before I moved to LA.
[30445.28s -> 30448.56s]  I also got that lump in my chest checked out and turns out it is benign.
[30449.28s -> 30450.56s]  Hope your father's day was good.
[30451.86s -> 30453.22s]  Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[30454.18s -> 30461.87s]  And my father, I'm going to be seeing my father really soon.
[30462.75s -> 30467.57s]  So, but that's glad that you've got that checked out and everything is
[30468.61s -> 30470.54s]  everything's good to go.
[30471.18s -> 30476.99s]  Because that shit is, you know, it can be fucking scary.
[30478.38s -> 30481.66s]  I'm still waiting on some biopsies, which I would have told.
[30482.54s -> 30483.82s]  Everything seems to be okay.
[30483.82s -> 30486.30s]  But you know, you always just keeps you up at night sometimes.
[30487.10s -> 30492.16s]  It takes a couple of weeks for them to come back.
[30492.16s -> 30492.96s]  Two, three weeks, I think.
[30494.34s -> 30496.18s]  It is like a, you know, it's a scary fucking thing.
[30497.33s -> 30498.05s]  Take care of yourself.
[30498.61s -> 30501.87s]  Keep yourselves in check.
[30505.14s -> 30506.50s]  But a green screen video.
[30506.50s -> 30511.39s]  We're going to do a green screen Encore Night on the 29th of June.
[30512.59s -> 30514.83s]  I'm going to hold this off until then.
[30519.41s -> 30520.53s]  Chat during stream.
[30520.53s -> 30522.53s]  LOL, this guy is a fucking idiot.
[30522.53s -> 30523.09s]  Wow.
[30523.09s -> 30524.21s]  Chat at the end of stream.
[30524.21s -> 30524.85s]  Hearts.
[30524.85s -> 30525.73s]  Love you, Jerma.
[30531.38s -> 30532.90s]  The duality of man.
[30536.05s -> 30536.29s]  No.
[30536.29s -> 30537.89s]  For the most part, people are just messing around.
[30539.15s -> 30542.03s]  I mean, I do some pretty stupid fucking things.
[30542.03s -> 30550.35s]  So I am not at, I am not completely absolved of all crime here.
[30550.91s -> 30555.28s]  But thank you so much for the video.
[30555.28s -> 30556.08s]  Hold on to it though.
[30556.88s -> 30558.90s]  Over the next week or so.
[30560.74s -> 30562.18s]  Well, probably in a couple days.
[30564.21s -> 30569.58s]  At least like a week before I'll get a good idea of kind of how we want to set that up.
[30570.30s -> 30572.94s]  Because I don't want like 500 video.
[30572.94s -> 30576.38s]  I kind of just want the ones that we haven't seen that have trickled through.
[30577.70s -> 30582.10s]  I don't want that to be like an eight hour, four or 500 video stream like the first one was.
[30582.10s -> 30587.22s]  I'd rather that just be like a chill, you know, not like a huge, huge, huge thing.
[30588.26s -> 30596.80s]  Is there more green screen footage for the Encore or do we just use the original?
[30598.46s -> 30601.34s]  It's just the stuff that's there and whatever other clips that you'd want to use.
[30602.30s -> 30605.26s]  But I would really like to get that.
[30605.26s -> 30609.02s]  So it was stuff that we missed and stuff people have made since.
[30610.13s -> 30612.05s]  And maybe a few others here and there.
[30612.05s -> 30617.02s]  It's not going to be, it'll be a little bit more condensed.
[30617.74s -> 30625.26s]  It'd be condensed, but it should be fun.
[30625.26s -> 30630.93s]  That also might just be on the end of a stream for a couple hours.
[30630.93s -> 30631.81s]  You know, an hour or two.
[30632.37s -> 30637.79s]  I will have some more details in the next three or four days.
[30638.35s -> 30643.39s]  I will probably, I'm going to be talking to mods in the Discord.
[30644.27s -> 30647.07s]  We'll get another probably channel going.
[30651.22s -> 30655.55s]  Not going to be a big, big thing.
[30655.55s -> 30658.59s]  But thank you to Tumsup for the 250.
[30659.23s -> 30660.75s]  Thanks for making my night like you always do.
[30660.75s -> 30663.31s]  My chest hurts from laughing and I've only been watching for an hour.
[30666.56s -> 30667.36s]  Thank you.
[30667.36s -> 30669.78s]  I'm glad you think it was fun.
[30671.78s -> 30674.74s]  I was so, it's weird this stream was so all over the place.
[30675.90s -> 30681.76s]  I was at my most upset and at my happiest on the same day.
[30682.80s -> 30683.89s]  That's weird.
[30685.06s -> 30688.90s]  I was so infuriated by like two or three things that happened tonight.
[30689.86s -> 30692.34s]  And it was like yin and yang tonight.
[30695.12s -> 30698.24s]  When I thought I wasn't going to be able to open the expansion pack.
[30698.24s -> 30700.08s]  Oh, you're talking, that's the yang.
[30703.39s -> 30706.59s]  When I slurped and spit into the person's mouth I was doing CPR with.
[30707.15s -> 30708.86s]  That's the yin right there.
[30718.42s -> 30720.42s]  You had four miracles tonight.
[30720.42s -> 30723.17s]  Yeah, I guess I did.
[30723.89s -> 30730.43s]  The high point was the spit and slurp.
[30730.43s -> 30735.15s]  I also think the bathtub and the E3 headbutt.
[30735.15s -> 30737.39s]  There was, I wish I could get that done.
[30737.39s -> 30738.03s]  I'm so sad.
[30741.89s -> 30742.45s]  Oh well.
[30742.45s -> 30744.85s]  I can't be crying over spilled E3.
[30745.65s -> 30747.65s]  Just have to clean it up.
[30748.29s -> 30749.84s]  Fortnite dance, yeah.
[30751.84s -> 30753.28s]  Yeah, there's some good things.
[30753.84s -> 30758.30s]  But thank you.
[30759.18s -> 30761.58s]  Thank you Pajagalo for the 10 bucks.
[30762.30s -> 30762.94s]  Ten dollars.
[30762.94s -> 30766.46s]  Hey Jeremy, just checking in from our parent corporation to inform you that
[30766.46s -> 30771.18s]  as per your contract, every film you make must end with a gorilla reading a book.
[30771.18s -> 30773.82s]  We had a great gorilla punchline at the end of E3.
[30774.30s -> 30778.70s]  The gorilla was on Reddit angry at the E3 conference that he just watched.
[30779.50s -> 30782.05s]  There was a pretty good callback there.
[30782.85s -> 30787.17s]  I was happy about that one.
[30787.73s -> 30790.16s]  So that technically counts.
[30790.16s -> 30795.42s]  But thank you for the 10 dollars.
[30796.61s -> 30798.69s]  Thank you Swiggity Swanky for the 7 dollars.
[30799.70s -> 30801.14s]  I know how much you love dreams.
[30801.78s -> 30805.38s]  I dreamt that I went to Germacon, but when I arrived it was empty.
[30806.27s -> 30808.51s]  It was only you and me, no one else.
[30808.51s -> 30811.63s]  When I asked where everyone was, you asked me to shake your hand.
[30812.27s -> 30817.79s]  But before I could do anything, you lunged at my hand and grasped it, holding it firmly.
[30818.35s -> 30823.95s]  I saw my arm was merging with yours, slowly absorbing me like from the thing.
[30824.75s -> 30827.15s]  I couldn't pull away and soon became you.
[30828.22s -> 30831.18s]  Now I understand why no one was at Germacon.
[30837.65s -> 30839.09s]  Just absorbing everybody?
[30841.14s -> 30843.68s]  Chat was Jerma all along.
[30843.68s -> 30844.88s]  Oh my god.
[30844.88s -> 30846.00s]  That's fucking insane.
[30848.48s -> 30852.48s]  If I ever do like a meetup here in Vegas, I will not be doing that.
[30854.72s -> 30855.84s]  T2000.
[30858.05s -> 30859.17s]  Very detailed dreams.
[30866.56s -> 30867.36s]  Thank you to...
[30868.48s -> 30870.32s]  Thank you to Nickname Jack for the 3 dollars.
[30870.32s -> 30871.92s]  Haven't shown any love in a while, so here it is.
[30872.64s -> 30873.92s]  Much love Mr. Pee Pants.
[30875.23s -> 30875.63s]  Thank you.
[30878.37s -> 30879.33s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[30884.03s -> 30886.27s]  We had Never Trust a Purple.
[30886.91s -> 30889.25s]  Thank you Purple for the 10 dollars.
[30891.49s -> 30893.81s]  Yo Jerma, any plan on a 3 year sub badge?
[30893.81s -> 30894.05s]  Yes.
[30894.69s -> 30898.78s]  There's gonna be a lot of random things added and changed on the channel.
[30899.50s -> 30902.32s]  There's gonna be lots of new sub badges.
[30902.32s -> 30904.72s]  There's gonna be new screens, a bunch of new music,
[30906.83s -> 30910.91s]  a bunch of changes in the back end of the channel.
[30910.91s -> 30911.87s]  There's gonna be a lot of...
[30911.87s -> 30913.15s]  There's gonna be a lot of new things here.
[30913.95s -> 30917.78s]  What about a no sub badge?
[30918.85s -> 30921.66s]  Yeah, I mean, that's fine.
[30922.38s -> 30924.42s]  You don't have to have a sub badge.
[30924.42s -> 30928.85s]  You don't have to have one.
[30928.85s -> 30934.77s]  Jerma default dance.
[30935.33s -> 30936.70s]  But thank you Purple.
[30939.25s -> 30944.91s]  Also DC Pro, thank you for the 245.
[30944.91s -> 30948.27s]  But I'm gonna say, I'm gonna round it up.
[30948.27s -> 30949.07s]  I'm tired.
[30949.63s -> 30950.35s]  I'm rounding it up.
[30951.36s -> 30951.76s]  Thank you.
[30953.18s -> 30954.46s]  Father's Day always sucks for me,
[30954.46s -> 30956.70s]  but last night's stream and tonight's stream got me through the weekend.
[30956.70s -> 30957.98s]  Thank you Jerma, hope all is well.
[30958.54s -> 30965.22s]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[30965.22s -> 30969.34s]  I'm sorry to hear that Father's Day is not a good day for you.
[30969.34s -> 30974.11s]  But we got a community of fun little jokesters here.
[30978.64s -> 30982.08s]  I'm sitting here talking about this fun great community of people
[30982.08s -> 30984.48s]  and they're so interesting and so helpful and so great.
[30985.28s -> 30986.48s]  How about another streamer?
[30986.48s -> 30988.00s]  Replace the streamer.
[30988.00s -> 30989.04s]  What about a new streamer?
[30989.04s -> 30989.84s]  This one is...
[30989.84s -> 30991.36s]  How do we get rid of behind a new host?
[30992.40s -> 31001.60s]  Any plan on new emotes?
[31001.60s -> 31007.22s]  Yeah, there'll be like five new emotes, maybe more.
[31009.47s -> 31014.11s]  I want to redo the tier two and tier three emotes
[31014.75s -> 31016.67s]  because they're dog shit or they don't exist.
[31017.39s -> 31018.32s]  Does it...
[31018.32s -> 31019.68s]  We don't even have any tier two...
[31019.68s -> 31020.16s]  Are they gone?
[31020.80s -> 31021.52s]  They can have one.
[31022.40s -> 31024.96s]  No, I don't have any tier two or tier three.
[31024.96s -> 31026.90s]  I was gonna change them.
[31032.14s -> 31033.10s]  Wait, is still...
[31033.10s -> 31034.38s]  Is the golden BS still...
[31034.94s -> 31037.42s]  Oh yeah, golden BS is still tier two.
[31039.38s -> 31040.98s]  Tier three is gonna be just something stupid,
[31041.78s -> 31043.38s]  but there's gotta be something there at least.
[31043.38s -> 31044.02s]  There are like...
[31045.18s -> 31047.66s]  There are a handful of tier three subs,
[31047.66s -> 31052.34s]  so I obviously don't want to just not have anything.
[31053.06s -> 31063.39s]  I don't know why I played that.
[31063.39s -> 31067.09s]  The tab was open and I'm closing tabs,
[31067.09s -> 31068.53s]  getting ready to end the stream,
[31068.53s -> 31069.97s]  and I just figured I would press the button.
[31070.77s -> 31074.37s]  What is this?
[31075.33s -> 31077.89s]  We are just so excited to have you...
[31080.40s -> 31081.84s]  Oh, that's audacity, never mind.
[31084.74s -> 31085.30s]  Shit show.
[31086.42s -> 31087.22s]  Fucking shit show.
[31087.22s -> 31088.74s]  That beginning took me so long.
[31089.54s -> 31091.62s]  That's probably when Joel came in with the raid too
[31091.62s -> 31092.50s]  and I'm just sitting there going,
[31092.50s -> 31093.70s]  I can't fucking do it!
[31093.70s -> 31094.50s]  I can't do it!
[31094.50s -> 31096.90s]  Like screaming and like headbutting some lady.
[31100.64s -> 31101.92s]  So excited.
[31101.92s -> 31102.96s]  So excited.
[31114.64s -> 31116.48s]  Edit all the clips and audacity.
[31116.48s -> 31117.76s]  Yeah, I'll clean it up.
[31117.76s -> 31122.13s]  I'll clean it up.
[31122.13s -> 31123.41s]  But that's gonna be it.
[31123.41s -> 31124.45s]  I'm gonna roll the credits.
[31124.45s -> 31125.65s]  There's a couple more bits that came through,
[31125.65s -> 31127.25s]  but I was gonna make sure I get the credits rolling.
[31128.29s -> 31129.25s]  A lot of subs tonight.
[31131.76s -> 31133.04s]  That's pretty usual.
[31133.04s -> 31134.80s]  I mean, there's a lot of subs every night.
[31134.80s -> 31135.52s]  So thanks, guys.
[31137.47s -> 31139.71s]  Yeah, Joel raided like a few hours ago?
[31139.71s -> 31140.43s]  Two, three hours ago?
[31146.32s -> 31147.92s]  There's a lot of people that are
[31147.92s -> 31149.68s]  continuously subscribed to this channel.
[31150.94s -> 31152.38s]  Month to month, day to day.
[31152.38s -> 31152.94s]  Week to week.
[31153.90s -> 31154.70s]  Year to year.
[31156.58s -> 31159.55s]  Thanks.
[31159.55s -> 31161.07s]  I will see you all on Tuesday.
[31164.62s -> 31167.66s]  And Wednesday's stream is gonna be
[31167.66s -> 31168.86s]  the last one for a little while.
[31170.08s -> 31173.28s]  Visiting family and getting some work done on a stream.
[31174.00s -> 31177.39s]  So I will be working.
[31178.03s -> 31179.15s]  I will be.
[31179.71s -> 31181.74s]  Just won't be on camera.
[31181.74s -> 31187.97s]  And let's get the last couple of bits that came in here.
[31189.97s -> 31190.45s]  They are.
[31194.21s -> 31195.65s]  No, I think I got them all.
[31195.65s -> 31196.29s]  I got them all.
[31200.96s -> 31202.16s]  Thanks for the laughs you've given us
[31202.16s -> 31204.40s]  watching you broadcast E3 while at E3
[31204.40s -> 31206.56s]  was oddly one of the most hilarious things I've ever done.
[31207.36s -> 31208.64s]  Thank you for everything and take care.
[31208.64s -> 31209.84s]  I think that was creamy sensation.
[31209.84s -> 31210.34s]  Thank you.
[31211.12s -> 31215.22s]  Watching you broadcast E3 while at E3.
[31216.42s -> 31217.62s]  Hold on.
[31217.62s -> 31218.10s]  Wait a minute.
[31222.94s -> 31225.18s]  You were watching me broadcast E3
[31225.18s -> 31226.70s]  while you were sitting at E3?
[31227.58s -> 31230.37s]  That would have been interesting.
[31235.44s -> 31236.48s]  Yes, it's the dunk tank.
[31237.04s -> 31241.20s]  And I'm going to give you, because this is 1230, 1240.
[31242.88s -> 31244.40s]  At the very least, it's the dunk tank.
[31244.40s -> 31245.68s]  And if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[31246.90s -> 31248.34s]  let's just talk about it for a second.
[31248.34s -> 31248.90s]  Might as well.
[31249.86s -> 31252.82s]  Because this is the last time I probably will talk about it
[31252.82s -> 31255.14s]  until you see it or until we have to test some things.
[31256.46s -> 31260.21s]  But the dunk tank stream, if you weren't here
[31260.21s -> 31261.49s]  or don't know what I'm talking about,
[31261.49s -> 31263.25s]  I am going to get a dunk tank.
[31264.21s -> 31265.82s]  And not just a dunk tank.
[31266.38s -> 31268.83s]  Because at this point, I want to do more.
[31270.64s -> 31274.00s]  We are the very least going to try very desperately.
[31274.72s -> 31277.28s]  Because I do have somebody who is very knowledgeable now.
[31277.28s -> 31278.88s]  I have like an actual robotics team
[31279.84s -> 31281.52s]  that I'm emailing back and forth with.
[31281.52s -> 31282.64s]  I have some calls with.
[31283.60s -> 31285.44s]  And I'll be meeting with other people too.
[31286.64s -> 31291.42s]  So the dunk tank is going to be potentially me up there.
[31292.30s -> 31294.72s]  I've got a dunk tank expert.
[31295.52s -> 31297.02s]  There's going to be a pitching machine
[31297.02s -> 31298.78s]  that is going to be attached to a robot
[31299.58s -> 31303.94s]  which you will be controlling to try to dunk me.
[31306.37s -> 31311.55s]  On top of that, on top of that,
[31312.19s -> 31317.66s]  I'm going to probably try to do other games
[31317.74s -> 31319.50s]  like a claw machine that you guys control,
[31319.50s -> 31320.62s]  like a little carnival.
[31323.14s -> 31324.10s]  I'm going to try.
[31325.15s -> 31327.63s]  This could be a catastrophic failure.
[31328.83s -> 31330.19s]  But if I get the green light,
[31332.99s -> 31336.11s]  if I do over these next five to 10 days,
[31336.11s -> 31337.79s]  because this is what I'm going to be working on.
[31338.59s -> 31340.83s]  If I get the legit green light here,
[31341.55s -> 31343.07s]  I'm going to focus on it almost completely.
[31346.91s -> 31349.47s]  So that's the plan.
[31350.03s -> 31352.51s]  If the plan works or not, we'll find out.
[31353.15s -> 31357.12s]  That is what I'm going to be trying to do.
[31358.00s -> 31359.44s]  The reason why I'm talking about it now
[31359.44s -> 31360.80s]  and been alluding to it is
[31360.80s -> 31362.56s]  because we're going to have to test some stuff.
[31363.94s -> 31366.58s]  You're going to see in the chat room, randomly,
[31366.58s -> 31369.14s]  probably like me and other people
[31369.14s -> 31371.30s]  and mods and stuff like pressing buttons.
[31373.22s -> 31374.10s]  You're not going to have any idea
[31374.10s -> 31375.54s]  what the hell is going on.
[31375.54s -> 31376.90s]  So I want you to be aware of it.
[31377.78s -> 31388.21s]  Because I cannot just turn it on
[31388.21s -> 31389.57s]  and be like, let's see if it works.
[31392.08s -> 31393.04s]  No, no, no.
[31393.04s -> 31394.16s]  I'm going to make sure this works
[31394.16s -> 31397.44s]  because I'll be putting probably some cash
[31398.00s -> 31398.48s]  into this.
[31405.73s -> 31406.13s]  We'll see.
[31409.06s -> 31410.66s]  Hopefully, it's not wasted time.
[31413.28s -> 31414.00s]  Wish me luck.
[31414.56s -> 31419.28s]  But thank you, everybody, for watching.
[31419.84s -> 31421.04s]  I'll see you on Tuesday.
[31425.42s -> 31427.34s]  And we'll play some more games.
[31427.34s -> 31428.38s]  Star and I are going to do something
[31428.38s -> 31429.42s]  and you'll see some modded...
[31430.22s -> 31432.21s]  I almost said The Sims 4.
[31432.21s -> 31433.01s]  May as well be.
[31433.65s -> 31435.06s]  Have a great night.
[31435.78s -> 31436.42s]  See you Tuesday.
[31437.22s -> 31438.26s]  Take care, guys.
[31438.26s -> 31438.66s]  Goodbye.
