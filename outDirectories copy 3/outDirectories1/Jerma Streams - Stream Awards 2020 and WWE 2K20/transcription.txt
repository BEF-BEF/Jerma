[68.73s -> 70.42s]  and
[70.42s -> 72.42s]  If I started at 6 30
[72.98s -> 78.02s]  Because I want to hit eastern time right like the new york city. That's when the ball drops the big ball in new york city
[78.02s -> 78.98s]  right
[78.98s -> 81.06s]  I want to hit eastern time
[81.06s -> 82.98s]  so
[82.98s -> 88.74s]  That's only like two out what six thirty seven or eight nine thirty ten thirty eleven thirty. That's only two and a half hours
[90.18s -> 94.74s]  This we got 19 categories to go through and an entire rumble card

[341.56s -> 343.56s]  I didn't even care because I didn't want to make a new envelope
[343.96s -> 347.32s]  So I was just like what if I don't want to cross that out? I don't care. It doesn't matter

[408.25s -> 411.37s]  That asterisk there's an asterisk on that because it's not actually trillions
[411.85s -> 416.01s]  But you know, it's as an asterisk. It's actually like it's not that much but it is a lot
[416.25s -> 418.25s]  It's not over a trillion though

[920.04s -> 925.32s]  Uh, I I did a noise and I I kind of do a noise sometimes where I'd like pretend to throw up in my mouth
[925.32s -> 929.84s]  And swallow it really quickly. I've done it like probably 30 times in the last two years
[930.40s -> 937.15s]  And um, I don't know. I don't know why I do it. I just think it's funny. So here's a compilation. This is this is uh,

[943.52s -> 949.84s]  I do this too much. I I don't care. I'm gonna continue to do it. So that's that's just the way it is

[1083.92s -> 1085.92s]  with the 15.5 percent
[1086.72s -> 1089.52s]  And then underneath that one is trying to stop the water
[1090.16s -> 1102.14s]  At 14.4.6 percent now you might be asking yourself. Why is that category on the list? Hey
[1102.78s -> 1107.69s]  There ain't no worse peter this year. I can say peter as much as I want now
[1107.69s -> 1110.97s]  I can say peter every I could say it as much as I want. It's not even it's not on the list

[1137.61s -> 1141.69s]  Sometimes it looks awful. Sometimes it looks so bad that I didn't i'm embarrassed
[1142.75s -> 1149.42s]  And a lot of people keep track of these and every year we try to find the worst case
[1149.98s -> 1157.00s]  Of bad hair that i've had for the entire year and there I think this year out of all the years
[1157.08s -> 1162.96s]  I think this is the worst year ever for this category. I think there was so many good ones
[1163.52s -> 1171.47s]  That this was tough. This was a tough one. Here are the nominees
[1172.44s -> 1176.91s]  worst hair of the year

[1373.60s -> 1378.96s]  Like hillary clinton was my career is over my my looks are over my career was over
[1378.96s -> 1381.44s]  My career was over right there, but I built it back
[1383.16s -> 1384.64s]  uh
[1384.64s -> 1388.42s]  Yeah, that was that there's no question that you look 60. I looked 600
[1389.20s -> 1397.96s]  Like I was mummified and they found me buried in like a tomb somewhere. What's this next one?
[1398.52s -> 1402.36s]  Oh, all right. So we're gonna stay on this cat. We're gonna all right. We we've we've got four
[1402.84s -> 1406.72s]  This is fourth, right? Uh staying in the same realm of worst hair
[1407.55s -> 1410.59s]  We have worst face and I held this up last year in a way like this
[1412.00s -> 1415.60s]  And people have tried to nominate that but i'm sorry that was not even a bad face
[1416.68s -> 1419.40s]  So we're gonna do this is we need real worst faces
[1420.09s -> 1422.41s]  And what is the worst face if you don't if you're new to the channel or something?
[1423.31s -> 1427.79s]  Uh, well sometimes when I go like this like if i'm scared at a video game or if there's something bad happens
[1427.79s -> 1432.11s]  There's something scary or something weird or i'm losing my mind and I go like this like like you know
[1432.11s -> 1436.06s]  I mean or I like freak out and like my I cringe up and stuff
[1437.04s -> 1440.72s]  Or it's just like somebody decides that I was ugly today and they take a screenshot of me
[1440.88s -> 1452.80s]  You're in the nominees for worst face of the year. See you in a sec
[1477.55s -> 1482.43s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no too big
[1482.83s -> 1485.55s]  Too big and too bright too big and too bright too big and too bright
[1493.12s -> 1495.84s]  That's the worst face 2020. Oh, yeah
[1496.56s -> 1497.84s]  You sure?
[1497.84s -> 1516.12s]  How about now? It's pretty bad
[1517.72s -> 1520.04s]  No, it's just weird. It's just gonna get like fucking weird
[1520.84s -> 1531.26s]  if i'm like
[1531.26s -> 1533.26s]  Not even that bad
[1533.58s -> 1537.34s]  That's what a toddler does when they know they did something wrong
[1540.08s -> 1547.95s]  That should be an emote stanley kubrick kubrick stare
[1549.95s -> 1559.61s]  It's fucking dark in here
[1559.69s -> 1564.09s]  So we were just sitting there and you're just spinning the thing around like all right. We win. We did it
[1565.13s -> 1567.13s]  What? I mean, I don't know
[1571.74s -> 1576.22s]  Go go go
[1576.54s -> 1580.59s]  God
[1580.59s -> 1582.59s]  That's what I can't explode
[1583.31s -> 1593.24s]  Holy shit
[1593.24s -> 1595.88s]  Uh, so the winner of the worst face of the year category
[1596.44s -> 1603.10s]  This was uh, it wasn't that close. It was it really wasn't that close the winner
[1603.90s -> 1606.81s]  What do you think?
[1606.81s -> 1618.14s]  What do you think with 28.8 percent of the vote? Who's the easy bake oven pizza face?
[1621.76s -> 1625.92s]  Coming in next at 14.7 percent was the kubrick stare
[1626.84s -> 1633.95s]  And then the wide grin was for 10.2 percent of the vote goblin got snubbed
[1635.00s -> 1640.09s]  Pretty hard. Yeah, I mean that's I mean the easy bake oven
[1640.65s -> 1647.82s]  Pizza tea thing that would mean it was it was revolting. It was disgusting. That was what lost by the most
[1648.94s -> 1651.42s]  Um, I don't think that's fair to that nominee
[1652.41s -> 1654.41s]  I don't think that's fair to that nominee
[1655.31s -> 1659.60s]  And hey time is it we got a rumble
[1660.16s -> 1666.65s]  We've got multiple matches. Hopefully, uh, 2k20 does not uh fuck up on us
[1666.97s -> 1673.21s]  I would be very disappointed if it does but i'm ready to start the first match of the rumble
[1673.84s -> 1677.79s]  We have five matches including the rumble. We're going to be starting with this one first
[1678.75s -> 1686.68s]  Uh, just give me one second while I get it going and we'll get it on the first match of the rumble
[1689.58s -> 1694.22s]  Is coming in. Hold on. I don't want to I don't want to spoil it. I don't want to spoil it
[1696.70s -> 1698.38s]  I don't want to spoil it
[1698.38s -> 1703.12s]  Oh, i'm okay
[1704.36s -> 1707.56s]  You thought just the new year's eve awards was the only thing we were doing here
[1707.56s -> 1710.12s]  Of course, we're going to do the germa rumble live
[1713.44s -> 1720.44s]  In beautiful las vegas nevada also where i've been standing tried to make an official germa arena
[1721.63s -> 1724.11s]  Uh, but the game crashed every time I tried to change
[1724.75s -> 1726.83s]  The rope whoa don't want to spoil anything
[1729.48s -> 1733.66s]  Uh, the game crashed every time I changed the color of the ropes. I couldn't do my own arena
[1734.72s -> 1738.68s]  2k20 is horrible. All right, you ready for the first match?
[1739.34s -> 1742.14s]  This one's I I think a lot of you guys are gonna have a lot riding on this one
[1744.44s -> 1748.03s]  You guys are gonna have a lot riding on this one. This is a
[1749.04s -> 1760.54s]  Tornado tag match and this is it's gonna get heated in the chat here 2v2 while it loads
[1761.88s -> 1766.54s]  We're going to have turn on predictions. Oh shit. I'm not ready for that
[1766.78s -> 1770.72s]  I'm not ready for that. I'm not ready for that. I'm not ready for it. I'm not ready for it
[1770.96s -> 1773.92s]  I'm not ready for it. Is there any mods that can help me? I'm not ready for it
[1774.24s -> 1777.93s]  I don't know what to do. I'm not ready for it. Are there any mods that can help me?
[1778.01s -> 1785.92s]  I'm not ready for I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Um, oh fuck. Well, you de-modded me
[1786.56s -> 1789.05s]  I'm sorry. No, I need to be
[1790.01s -> 1794.65s]  Hold on
[1794.65s -> 1813.34s]  Shit, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Is that something that we can easily do? Can we easily do that? Uh, what?
[1815.26s -> 1824.33s]  Yes, yes, yes, can we mod mod mod mod everyone
[1828.54s -> 1836.25s]  Uh, how come this is not loading? Tell us the characters in discord. Tell us the character. Oh shit. Oh my god
[1836.33s -> 1840.25s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I need my discord
[1840.81s -> 1847.02s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on
[1849.76s -> 1859.95s]  Hold on there you go. All right, they have the first match. How come I can't why is this not loading?
[1866.12s -> 1868.12s]  Wait, I didn't just like play the game. Did I?
[1868.52s -> 1873.64s]  I hope i'm not playing the game
[1875.66s -> 1879.18s]  The first match of the evening is going to be a tag team match. Hey, i'm talking
[1881.32s -> 1882.36s]  I'm talking
[1882.36s -> 1889.53s]  They're all from new york
[1891.48s -> 1892.84s]  I'm gonna have to turn
[1892.84s -> 1896.76s]  The it's gonna be kiryu and majima in a tag match
[1898.06s -> 1899.18s]  versus
[1899.18s -> 1902.38s]  Two other characters and by the way, this is a stipulation on this one
[1903.77s -> 1906.19s]  stipulation on this one
[1906.19s -> 1908.99s]  Whoever wins this match gets another stream
[1909.79s -> 1911.47s]  Really important to mention
[1911.47s -> 1913.32s]  as majima comes in
[1913.32s -> 1915.95s]  This tag partner will be coming in too
[1919.61s -> 1922.73s]  Kiryu as you know from yakuza who's a zero to be exact
[1923.93s -> 1925.93s]  Gotta shut this guy up
[1926.09s -> 1928.09s]  Also from new york
[1932.54s -> 1934.54s]  Yeah, why does it say you suck
[1934.62s -> 1940.92s]  I think by the way, I gave him andre the giant's entrance
[1941.56s -> 1944.68s]  I think that's why he's walking so slow
[1944.92s -> 1947.16s]  They're all from the bronx. They're all from brooklyn
[1951.18s -> 1954.38s]  I don't think we can even do the betting right now. I like didn't set it up. It's all right
[1954.78s -> 1957.82s]  Do it later do it uh, do it on uh betting
[1958.46s -> 1960.78s]  But uh, but who are they fighting against though? That's important
[1962.72s -> 1965.76s]  Who are they gonna fight against who would deserve another stream? What do you guys think?
[1966.40s -> 1972.44s]  There are two characters. I know that people are really really would love to see come back
[1973.79s -> 1977.05s]  It's not bugsnax
[1977.53s -> 1981.44s]  Not godhand
[1981.44s -> 1983.37s]  Not la noir
[1983.37s -> 1987.12s]  Two beloved characters
[1987.12s -> 1988.80s]  You see one of them right now
[1988.80s -> 1993.77s]  The lights have just turned off
[1993.85s -> 1998.09s]  Introducing for the second team of the who gets another stream match. It's salmon maps
[2005.20s -> 2007.68s]  I know a lot of you guys got stuff riding on this
[2014.89s -> 2020.52s]  So who's gonna win this is tornado tag, by the way, they're in the they're in there at the same time
[2021.08s -> 2024.60s]  Oh, wait, we got a wait. We got a prediction
[2026.12s -> 2028.12s]  Win channel points. Oh shit. We got it
[2028.28s -> 2030.72s]  magima and kira versus sam and max
[2031.37s -> 2033.37s]  both desperately want to see their
[2033.37s -> 2035.37s]  respective franchises continue
[2035.37s -> 2043.87s]  Let your channel points if you want to
[2043.87s -> 2046.67s]  Who do you think is going to win this match? Oh what an entrance there?
[2048.41s -> 2050.41s]  Flipping over the top rope
[2052.28s -> 2055.10s]  Just flying in
[2055.10s -> 2057.10s]  Taking his time with his bird feet
[2057.34s -> 2064.09s]  Has to be a dog
[2064.09s -> 2065.61s]  13 14
[2065.61s -> 2068.36s]  14.8
[2068.36s -> 2071.05s]  To 11. Okay
[2071.13s -> 2072.49s]  Here comes sam
[2072.49s -> 2075.47s]  I mean max who's the bunny?
[2075.47s -> 2079.23s]  I really hope i'm not controlling a character because like I don't I didn't set it up that way
[2082.19s -> 2085.00s]  All right, get your drinks going
[2085.16s -> 2087.48s]  Alcoholic or non-alcoholic and here comes max
[2097.13s -> 2099.93s]  They all just live in a high rise in new york
[2100.41s -> 2109.44s]  all of them it's like
[2109.52s -> 2112.91s]  60 apartments
[2112.91s -> 2114.91s]  It's the germa house, but i'm not in new york
[2118.80s -> 2123.04s]  I'm gonna laugh so hard if I have to control a character because i'm gonna be pissed because i'm gonna have to restart it
[2123.68s -> 2132.89s]  He didn't have a shirt on
[2132.89s -> 2135.77s]  Well, wait, he's a bunny so he doesn't have a shirt on
[2137.26s -> 2141.26s]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here comes the beginning of this match. We're gonna have sam and max versus kiryu
[2141.82s -> 2143.58s]  And how do I say that name?
[2143.58s -> 2149.84s]  I'm saying it's so wrong
[2149.84s -> 2152.00s]  He has it kiryu. Okay kiryu
[2154.49s -> 2158.49s]  Kiryu and majima versus sam and max again the winner of this competition gets another stream
[2160.46s -> 2164.22s]  Bonito tag matchup. They all have health on the bottom and here we go
[2164.94s -> 2168.30s]  All right off the bat sam with a flying leg kick
[2169.18s -> 2171.18s]  Right into majima's face. They're also huge
[2172.80s -> 2176.27s]  Look at the referee
[2176.27s -> 2178.43s]  Now there are rules here. There are rules
[2184.94s -> 2186.78s]  This is not a hardcore match
[2186.86s -> 2194.14s]  Snap suplex by majima onto sam right in his back and taunting is kiryu, which was a very very bad idea with his max
[2197.66s -> 2201.66s]  Kicks him completely out of the ring in one boot. Is he gonna suplex him out of the ring? I'm not sure
[2201.66s -> 2203.82s]  No, he's going to throw him on the on the top rope
[2204.78s -> 2205.74s]  and
[2205.74s -> 2207.74s]  Knee him directly in his skull
[2207.98s -> 2212.67s]  Majima taking a little bit of punishment here. Well, kiryu comes back in and max is
[2213.29s -> 2215.29s]  Absolutely destroying right now
[2217.22s -> 2219.22s]  I don't think max has taken one punch
[2220.62s -> 2225.19s]  Sam has though
[2225.19s -> 2229.27s]  Nice dodge by max with the reversal into the triple shin kick
[2229.99s -> 2232.31s]  He's going for the pin
[2232.31s -> 2234.31s]  It's no way. It's way too early for that
[2237.82s -> 2242.60s]  Wait, did he just hit his head?
[2242.60s -> 2244.04s]  Now you would think
[2244.04s -> 2245.72s]  That hurricanrana
[2245.72s -> 2247.72s]  That's a good reversal there from kiryu
[2248.90s -> 2253.14s]  Max now in a little bit of trouble on the outside of the ropes here. Well sam and majima is still outside
[2254.02s -> 2257.70s]  And I think sam has just thrown majima back and forth three or four times
[2260.12s -> 2263.37s]  Why is nobody here?
[2263.37s -> 2265.37s]  Why isn't nobody in the audience?
[2266.65s -> 2271.13s]  This event like
[2272.86s -> 2274.63s]  Max is carrying
[2274.63s -> 2277.99s]  I think I want to turn the I want to turn the hud off. I don't want to see the information
[2278.71s -> 2282.07s]  Looks like kiryu sent her for a powerbomb. Maybe no. He just let him go
[2283.05s -> 2284.98s]  He let him go
[2284.98s -> 2287.62s]  He keeps taunting
[2287.62s -> 2291.30s]  Now what I was gonna say earlier is you would think that sam and max would have the disadvantage here
[2292.10s -> 2294.10s]  Because they're not really fighters
[2294.58s -> 2298.84s]  They're more investigators detectives. Although sam does have a gun
[2300.84s -> 2302.84s]  Ice suplex there by sam out of majima
[2303.66s -> 2310.14s]  Kiryu working that skull cap of max majima looks like he's in a lot of trouble max isn't a lot of trouble too though
[2311.72s -> 2315.32s]  Setting it up here looks at onto the top rope. No, well, he's trying to think about what he wants to do with him
[2315.32s -> 2316.84s]  He's gonna throw about side of the ring
[2316.84s -> 2319.64s]  Nope just hit his face on that corner turnbuckle
[2322.46s -> 2324.46s]  Both of them want to see another scream so badly
[2327.03s -> 2328.87s]  Is sam going to submit here?
[2328.87s -> 2333.43s]  We might see a submit no reversal punching a couple of times in the face right in the nose and then getting on
[2333.43s -> 2336.31s]  Top of them doing a little twisty turn he can run up
[2338.98s -> 2343.32s]  A lot of reversals
[2343.32s -> 2347.48s]  If you take a look at the health bars down there you get to see max is in a lot of trouble big ddt
[2350.28s -> 2352.52s]  Doing a lot of taunting
[2352.60s -> 2354.60s]  We see from kiryu and majima
[2354.68s -> 2357.43s]  This does not look good for sam and max right now
[2361.99s -> 2365.99s]  Big neck breaker, although kiryu is bringing him over into the corner here. I'm not sure what his plan is
[2368.73s -> 2372.01s]  Max blew all of his energy in the first 30 seconds of the match
[2372.89s -> 2374.89s]  And he is almost toast
[2376.76s -> 2379.85s]  What?
[2379.85s -> 2381.37s]  Why did he fall down?
[2381.37s -> 2383.37s]  Are they gonna set up a double team move?
[2384.65s -> 2395.45s]  Majima win the first match of the evening
[2396.09s -> 2401.38s]  Oh my god
[2401.38s -> 2404.34s]  He just broke every bone in his body
[2404.34s -> 2406.52s]  What?
[2406.52s -> 2408.52s]  When did he give him the stunner?
[2414.62s -> 2419.50s]  Congratulations to kiryu and majima yakuza zero is going to get another stream
[2422.54s -> 2427.42s]  We will see another stream from kiryu and majima. Sorry sam and max max. I think is dead
[2433.82s -> 2435.82s]  Oh
[2435.82s -> 2437.34s]  Oh, man
[2437.34s -> 2439.90s]  Did I heard like a bunch of bones break?
[2440.78s -> 2442.46s]  He weighs so much
[2442.46s -> 2444.86s]  Kiryu is like a 200 plus pound man
[2446.22s -> 2448.22s]  And max is a bunny rabbit
[2448.30s -> 2451.88s]  He weighs like fucking four pounds
[2452.36s -> 2456.34s]  That was horrible
[2456.34s -> 2459.11s]  Okay
[2459.11s -> 2461.83s]  Well, uh, we can move on to the next match in a minute here
[2462.55s -> 2468.65s]  We're gonna do a couple more categories. That was the first match of the evening. I'm gonna turn this off
[2468.65s -> 2471.62s]  We're gonna keep this right here
[2471.62s -> 2474.42s]  And I just like I blew schnauz out of my nose when he landed on him
[2474.82s -> 2477.14s]  I I really did. I like blew my nose like hard
[2477.70s -> 2481.03s]  I don't want to don't wipe it on the I don't want to wipe it on the jacket. Hold on. What do I do?
[2483.32s -> 2489.80s]  38.7 million have been traded hands here. Congratulations. Those that have bet all right. Hold on a minute
[2489.80s -> 2492.44s]  I can't turn the camera until I I gotta oh, here we go. This is afghan writer
[2494.65s -> 2502.26s]  I brought this up for a very specific reason use it as hair grease
[2502.98s -> 2505.45s]  Oh my god, you're disgusting

[3101.26s -> 3104.78s]  Because you could I guess I hit some of those notes, but the end was really bad
[3105.84s -> 3109.44s]  And there and I really sounded like kind of like a horn with no air left in it
[3111.78s -> 3113.78s]  So, I mean it could have been both
[3114.50s -> 3116.26s]  But you know, we'll see
[3116.34s -> 3122.10s]  We'll see what the people have voted for the winner of best singing of the entire year goes to

[3196.03s -> 3203.09s]  It's when somebody one of you is able to be to derail the entire stream and almost
[3203.65s -> 3208.18s]  Sometimes change everything we're doing by a simple comment or something that you have said
[3208.82s -> 3218.14s]  Uh, so here are the nominees and I think there are a lot of them for the best one guy moment of the year

[3513.34s -> 3515.17s]  takes a lot
[3515.17s -> 3521.78s]  okay, um
[3521.78s -> 3522.80s]  with
[3522.80s -> 3528.10s]  62 percent of the votes 62.5 percent. This is not even fair. It should have been in its own like category
[3528.66s -> 3530.74s]  It should have just been like we should have just omitted it
[3531.38s -> 3542.51s]  It was it's thick germa like with 62.5 percent of the vote. It spawned a lot of shit right underneath that
[3543.15s -> 3547.71s]  You gotta well, you gotta go pretty far. You gotta go down to uh with 11.8 percent of the vote

[3584.81s -> 3589.36s]  Snubs snubs all over the place not photoshopped
[3591.17s -> 3594.35s]  And it could have been uh, we're gonna do actually two more

[3914.38s -> 3919.90s]  It's been on here every single year if I do homer even for a second even for one goddamn second
[3921.54s -> 3925.12s]  It's on here. If I do lisa or marge it's on here
[3925.76s -> 3927.28s]  every single year
[3927.28s -> 3930.03s]  Try homer now. No, it'll be on here
[3930.51s -> 3934.43s]  No, the best part about this stream is like a bunch of you guys forget the fucked up shit
[3934.43s -> 3937.18s]  I'm gonna do tonight. You know what I mean?
[3937.18s -> 3940.62s]  And it's tech wait and here's the next best part about this stream
[3941.18s -> 3945.90s]  It ain't even january yet. So I I can do whatever I want on these award streams
[3947.70s -> 3952.02s]  So it's the last day. You can't even nominate this. It's it's lost forever. It's lost in a void
[3953.95s -> 3956.26s]  So, all right, here we go
[3956.26s -> 3957.06s]  Hey
[3957.06s -> 3959.07s]  Hey mark, it's me
[3959.07s -> 3966.90s]  Ooh, that's what I look like when I do that. Uh, in second place was rick and morty greenscreen with 11.4 percent
[3967.89s -> 3970.69s]  And and then a cow at 10.7 percent
[3971.09s -> 3973.97s]  I could understand the cow one and I could understand the simpsons one
[3974.21s -> 3978.50s]  But the rick and morty greenscreen one I thought was like kind of good. I like thought I did a good job
[3978.98s -> 3987.25s]  Sometimes you think things that are not right. It's january here. What's wait? What time is it right now?
[3989.04s -> 3990.40s]  nine
[3990.40s -> 3991.84s]  It's nine thirty
[3991.84s -> 4001.31s]  Okay, it's nine thirty right now. I got we're dropping it on eastern time. It's six thirty my time
[4001.31s -> 4007.47s]  But it's nine thirty eastern. We have two and a half hours. Okay, so uh, just like the bad ones
[4007.47s -> 4013.23s]  They're also the good ones too. This is best impression of the year. Actually what?
[4017.34s -> 4029.01s]  Okay, auto there there joe auto. He's right there. He's under he's sleeping
[4029.01s -> 4035.50s]  I'm not gonna go wake him up. Just get him on camera. Okay. What if somebody walked into your bedroom and
[4036.48s -> 4040.98s]  Fucking just opened the cupboard and was like hey, hey come over here. What's going on?
[4041.14s -> 4047.07s]  Come here. Come here. Look. Hey. Hey, what's up? Hey, look at the camera. What the fuck are you doing here?
[4047.47s -> 4057.12s]  I don't want to do that like he's sleeping. He's having like a nice rest. I don't want to like go disturb him
[4058.90s -> 4060.90s]  Just rotate the camera
[4061.14s -> 4065.89s]  He's under the blanket though. You can't see him. All right, here come the category the nominees for best impression of the year
[4066.99s -> 4074.11s]  Uh, let's see. Let's see if your favorite got selected. See if your favorite got fucking selected
[4074.19s -> 4080.83s]  That's the right button jeremy. Don't press the one guy one again. Here we go
[4081.87s -> 4094.14s]  I don't want to do that. Mr. Turtle. I don't want to see that and I don't want you to come into my house
[4094.22s -> 4099.20s]  Okay, aim on do an okay acting challenge r2 d2 dying easy
[4101.66s -> 4106.13s]  But there's a storm
[4106.13s -> 4108.43s]  Uh, it's not raining yet
[4109.15s -> 4113.31s]  Uh, besides it's not actually that unsafe to swim in the storm
[4115.07s -> 4116.35s]  everyone, uh
[4116.35s -> 4118.35s]  Keep telling me take it out of the sea
[4119.57s -> 4122.05s]  But it's safer in here and it is up there
[4122.77s -> 4124.13s]  uh
[4124.13s -> 4126.75s]  Bernie, how would you like to respond to that?
[4126.91s -> 4128.43s]  I just uh want to say
[4128.43s -> 4129.63s]  that I think
[4129.63s -> 4133.25s]  That answer was cringe. The following has
[4134.19s -> 4139.18s]  Encouragement that's what it is. It's a bunch of compress the following has
[4139.88s -> 4142.46s]  encouragement
[4142.46s -> 4144.83s]  and love
[4144.83s -> 4147.07s]  We want to thank you for being here
[4149.68s -> 4152.16s]  You're the one that gets things done around here
[4157.02s -> 4159.02s]  well, tell him a
[4159.56s -> 4161.56s]  great job
[4162.86s -> 4166.78s]  Like I think that we can maybe get some quality entertainment here scoop
[4172.48s -> 4177.44s]  Like maybe we should stop streaming scoop, I think maybe that's a good idea
[4192.24s -> 4194.00s]  We are not ready
[4194.08s -> 4196.08s]  To move forward on a stimulus
[4198.00s -> 4201.84s]  Not yet, maybe soon we will move forward on that but my
[4209.18s -> 4214.92s]  Tell me everything, you know
[4215.88s -> 4222.04s]  Like a parakeet
[4222.04s -> 4226.86s]  Yeah, it makes sense. Right? Look at half of my mannerisms just like
[4228.06s -> 4230.06s]  Step on me step on me
[4242.65s -> 4246.01s]  Steady diet of like captain crunching baloney. That's how you end up like that
[4247.87s -> 4250.03s]  the winner of best impression of the year
[4251.10s -> 4263.13s]  is
[4270.19s -> 4274.35s]  R2 d2 dying sound with 34 percent of the vote
[4275.58s -> 4277.82s]  Second is bernie sanders with 18 percent
[4278.46s -> 4283.02s]  And then rounding us off at the end at number three was mitch mcconnell at 12.7
[4283.66s -> 4293.31s]  mitch mcconnell
[4308.68s -> 4312.28s]  Coming up next we have oh, no, no, no, no. No. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Well, we're done
[4312.36s -> 4315.79s]  We're done. We're done. We're done. We're gonna do it. We're gonna do a uh match
[4317.28s -> 4328.49s]  Political how's that political mitch mcconnell right now is like more hated than the joker is in gotham city in the fucking dc universe
[4332.49s -> 4340.64s]  Really?
[4340.64s -> 4343.45s]  Is that politics?
[4343.45s -> 4345.45s]  It's still political
[4345.69s -> 4351.24s]  Yeah, whatever. It's the cbd coming out. It sure is
[4351.88s -> 4356.11s]  I promise i'm not pissing
[4356.11s -> 4358.78s]  You probably might my noise gate probably didn't pick it up
[4359.42s -> 4362.50s]  So by the way, somebody said cbd is unregulated
[4364.16s -> 4366.64s]  Okay, and bananas have radioactive poison in them, whatever
[4369.68s -> 4375.71s]  Uh, we're gonna do the next match of the rumble and make sure I get it. I gotta hold on. Let me turn this off for a second
[4376.27s -> 4380.11s]  Let me just let me let me see if I can make sure that I don't want I don't want the hud be gone
[4380.59s -> 4390.62s]  I don't want to hud
[4390.62s -> 4393.10s]  Yeah, uh, I I know I know we're gonna do the betting
[4393.58s -> 4397.64s]  This is gonna be the second match of the evening and this one is gonna be very fun
[4398.20s -> 4403.71s]  It might even be funny too. Let me just give the mods who it is
[4404.27s -> 4412.46s]  So they can do the prediction. Uh, I could
[4413.18s -> 4415.55s]  Hold on
[4418.11s -> 4419.39s]  Uh
[4419.39s -> 4421.39s]  Uh, wait, can you only do?
[4422.20s -> 4428.11s]  Wait, you can only do one. This is a three-way extreme rules match. I'm not sure we can we can predict this one
[4430.46s -> 4436.81s]  Yeah, we cannot we can't do the predictions on this one. You can only do uh, two. It's only two
[4437.92s -> 4445.56s]  Yeah, it's a three-way
[4445.56s -> 4447.13s]  It will
[4447.13s -> 4450.41s]  Oh when there are only two left. Well, whoever who have a pens wins and you know, it doesn't even matter
[4450.49s -> 4452.86s]  I'll just I'll show it to you right now
[4452.94s -> 4460.54s]  Ladies and gentlemen coming up next is the uh, the ritz brothers comedy routine al ritz jimmy ritz and harry ritz
[4465.00s -> 4481.02s]  Extreme rules a little sneak peek and uh, let me just make sure I can turn the hud off. What is the gorilla?
[4481.66s -> 4488.73s]  Oh, should I turn the volume all down? Oops. That's right. I had to do that
[4489.61s -> 4501.63s]  Introducing first in the ritz brothers comedy match. They're gonna do some uh, some slapstick for you is harry ritz. I think he's the oldest
[4505.42s -> 4508.09s]  Also from new york
[4508.09s -> 4509.93s]  Harry richie what?
[4509.93s -> 4514.48s]  All right. Let me see if I can do this
[4514.48s -> 4517.74s]  Can I can I turn off the hud?
[4517.74s -> 4523.88s]  What? Go get him
[4530.24s -> 4538.16s]  Here's harry ritz pointing to the ceiling thinking he's gay. I don't I think all these guys
[4538.96s -> 4542.96s]  Why does it say that in the bottom right corner? I just I think I just put it there
[4543.68s -> 4546.56s]  Yeah, these guys are from the the public domain movie night
[4547.12s -> 4548.48s]  earlier this year
[4548.48s -> 4551.36s]  Was that even not even been 2019?
[4552.00s -> 4554.68s]  They don't hey, by the way, they don't have to be from this year
[4556.11s -> 4558.59s]  We have like two years of characters to catch up with
[4563.42s -> 4567.90s]  When you see one ritz brothers entrance, do you really need to see the other two ritz brothers entrances?
[4567.90s -> 4572.00s]  That's what I want to ask you guys
[4572.64s -> 4574.40s]  I guess the answer is yes
[4574.40s -> 4578.94s]  Why do you get opponents first?
[4579.18s -> 4583.44s]  From new york weighing in at 200 pounds
[4596.40s -> 4598.40s]  All 200
[4599.72s -> 4602.59s]  Which is like a oh
[4602.59s -> 4604.59s]  Oh my god, I can't even
[4604.75s -> 4611.00s]  See this showing his armpits
[4611.00s -> 4617.39s]  Hey, what do you think of these ones boy?
[4617.39s -> 4621.63s]  Uh, did they somebody ask did they remove custom arenas? No, I tried to make one but 2k 20
[4622.19s -> 4624.19s]  is such a piece of
[4624.33s -> 4626.33s]  steaming burning shit
[4626.59s -> 4630.03s]  That the game would crash when I change the colors of the ropes
[4634.22s -> 4637.26s]  It just you just can't do it. Apparently. I I can't make it through the
[4638.58s -> 4643.18s]  Explosions coming out here
[4643.18s -> 4646.46s]  This who is this? Oh, of course. It's it's it's the youngest brother
[4647.56s -> 4649.48s]  That's jimmy ritz and
[4649.48s -> 4653.45s]  From new york weighing in at 200 pounds
[4654.25s -> 4655.35s]  jimmy
[4655.35s -> 4660.33s]  richie
[4660.33s -> 4662.33s]  The other entrance is so long
[4663.55s -> 4672.60s]  So what do they get this is an extreme rules match there's no stakes here, by the way, they just wanted to come to
[4673.40s -> 4676.84s]  Term a rumble of 2020 and show us their comedy routine
[4677.72s -> 4679.72s]  Ritz brothers are like the three stooges
[4680.12s -> 4685.00s]  But um sort of like the off-brand serial version of the three stooges and i'm gonna make a statement here
[4685.00s -> 4687.00s]  I think the ritz brothers are funnier
[4687.00s -> 4689.24s]  Than the three stooges. I think they have more comedy
[4690.04s -> 4697.50s]  I think they have much more style
[4698.72s -> 4701.68s]  Because I mean the three stooges simply just hit each other in the head
[4702.00s -> 4707.60s]  With their fists and like poke their eyes with their fingers and stuff the ritz brothers go on detective searches. They cook food
[4708.48s -> 4714.36s]  But hold on one second here. Can I pause it? I can't even pause it
[4715.58s -> 4719.42s]  On stage and well put a beautiful beautiful slap to the chest
[4722.81s -> 4727.85s]  I don't know who is who so this is the extreme rules comedy routine
[4729.04s -> 4732.92s]  I think that was jimmy ritz
[4734.44s -> 4737.60s]  I think that was hal al I don't even know who they are
[4739.71s -> 4744.99s]  And jimmy ritz with a ddt onto al ritz's skull going for a pin automatically. He's not gonna get it that way
[4745.79s -> 4747.79s]  as bob ritz
[4747.79s -> 4753.39s]  Sticks in here going for pivot a piledriver or something powerbomb or what a reversal like jim ritz
[4755.53s -> 4758.49s]  Is he gonna let it happen? No way, you can't just let that happen like that
[4759.45s -> 4762.25s]  Now ritz gets grabbed by german suplex onto al ritz
[4767.82s -> 4772.48s]  Full punch in the face from harry ritz another one
[4774.03s -> 4776.03s]  No, a reversal by jimmy ritz
[4784.65s -> 4786.17s]  So funny
[4786.17s -> 4788.81s]  I love how they like bop each other in the head and stuff
[4789.79s -> 4791.47s]  Oh, there he goes
[4791.47s -> 4797.98s]  These guys are so god damn funny
[4798.62s -> 4801.47s]  What's he gonna do? Oh a little slap in the face
[4806.75s -> 4808.75s]  As jimmy ritz is outside the ring
[4809.39s -> 4811.39s]  Currently grabbing on for dear life
[4811.71s -> 4815.31s]  As one of the I don't know one of the other ones jimmy ritz is going into this corner here
[4815.31s -> 4817.31s]  It looks like he might have been looking for something
[4817.63s -> 4821.28s]  Jimmy ritz is going underneath to get a comedy utensil
[4822.00s -> 4823.60s]  And he's got a chair
[4823.60s -> 4827.80s]  The funniest object there is and he doesn't even get to use it
[4828.60s -> 4831.66s]  He just gets punched in the face by harry ritz
[4832.38s -> 4834.38s]  And a belly to belly suplex for his trouble
[4837.79s -> 4840.03s]  Only one comedy utensil in the ring right now
[4841.47s -> 4843.87s]  Jimmy ritz. Oh, no all of them go outside
[4849.08s -> 4851.08s]  And al ritz has a sledgehammer
[4852.59s -> 4856.67s]  Oh, and he misses completely. They don't really want to hurt each other. They're just actors
[4861.39s -> 4864.91s]  And jimmy ritz takes an eye poke a classic comedy eye poke
[4865.71s -> 4868.37s]  I think al ritz is I think harry ritz is bleeding
[4871.26s -> 4873.26s]  What is that a pool cue
[4876.64s -> 4881.60s]  Do not let him pin him
[4881.68s -> 4886.72s]  There are now three comedy utensils you see he was like, ah, i'm gonna get you watch out wise guy
[4889.21s -> 4892.67s]  Dropping him right on the tailbone
[4892.75s -> 4897.07s]  That's gotta hurt
[4897.07s -> 4900.27s]  Into the ropes here misses the punch great comedy duck
[4901.64s -> 4903.64s]  Oh, they they do that so well
[4903.88s -> 4905.88s]  They're so good at this
[4905.88s -> 4908.60s]  By the way, everybody needs to know this they're not actually hurting each other
[4909.84s -> 4914.16s]  They're doing just enough damage and just enough pretending to make it look good on camera
[4914.80s -> 4916.32s]  Although that one looked real
[4916.40s -> 4918.41s]  So did that one
[4918.41s -> 4923.85s]  That one this looks pretty real harry harry harry you've been going a little too hard cameras aren't even rolling anymore
[4924.41s -> 4927.53s]  And I think that's gonna be it
[4927.53s -> 4929.61s]  No way. Oh my goodness
[4930.99s -> 4932.99s]  Jimmy ritz going to get another comedy utensil down here
[4933.63s -> 4937.15s]  What do you get? He's got a baseball bat
[4939.53s -> 4970.99s]  They're just pretending folks. It's okay. Nobody's actually injured right now
[4971.63s -> 4973.63s]  As jimmy ritz breaks it up
[4976.54s -> 4978.54s]  You're just masterful comedian
[4978.94s -> 4983.61s]  Gonna bring him up to the corner here up to the top turnbuckle
[4984.33s -> 4986.97s]  What is jimmy ritz planning to do to his brother harry ritz?
[4987.77s -> 4990.93s]  He's got him all the way up here. He's gonna go for a suplex
[4992.11s -> 4994.11s]  A suplex off the top rope
[4994.43s -> 4997.15s]  Oh, and there's no way harry's gonna get up from that one
[5009.24s -> 5015.96s]  So many reversals by jimmy ritz i'm gonna go for a forward wow beautiful flipping backwards neck breaker there
[5015.96s -> 5022.76s]  There fantastic stuff jimmy ritz going for the pin can al get in there quick enough to he completely missed
[5025.08s -> 5027.64s]  Not the bat again, not the comedy bat
[5031.56s -> 5034.46s]  DDT by jimmy ritz onto al al is in bad shape
[5037.15s -> 5039.15s]  He's in really bad shape right now
[5041.23s -> 5044.35s]  As now jimmy harry seems at the most hp out of the three of them
[5045.31s -> 5048.91s]  Big dropping suplex there gonna try to go for a pin. No bring him to the center of the ring
[5049.55s -> 5051.55s]  Lying next to his brother
[5051.55s -> 5053.84s]  This is a little weird
[5053.84s -> 5056.64s]  Ooh face stomp right in the front of the forward part of your face
[5060.27s -> 5062.83s]  Nice reversal by jimmy ritz that hurt his hand. He actually hit him
[5063.98s -> 5067.58s]  We might have to cut here. He actually punched him in the face accidentally
[5072.03s -> 5074.52s]  Put down the sledgehammer. No, he
[5074.52s -> 5076.52s]  This looks like a finishing move
[5076.52s -> 5079.45s]  No, it's just a throw
[5079.45s -> 5081.45s]  Just a throw and now he's taunting
[5083.18s -> 5086.22s]  That's harry ritz, by the way, the strongest of the three brothers
[5087.32s -> 5089.08s]  Taking it outside
[5089.08s -> 5094.57s]  Now he gets thrown right back in
[5094.57s -> 5097.77s]  This is al I believe and harry is now stuck in the ropes
[5098.57s -> 5100.57s]  That may have just been a broken neck
[5101.98s -> 5105.34s]  There's no way that this is gonna work out this way jimmy ritz is still outside. We got a one count
[5105.34s -> 5107.34s]  We've got a two count hit no
[5111.60s -> 5113.44s]  and just like
[5113.44s -> 5116.08s]  Every three stooges movie and every ritz brothers movie
[5117.04s -> 5119.20s]  This is going on for way too long

[5130.24s -> 5133.04s]  Finishing the comedy routine for the germa rumble 2020
[5133.60s -> 5139.15s]  I love how we're watching the replay of a pin that didn't work
[5143.60s -> 5146.32s]  Not even a mention of the bat that was involved earlier
[5150.94s -> 5153.23s]  They're all dead
[5153.23s -> 5162.72s]  What please remember predictions?
[5163.44s -> 5166.08s]  Well, we couldn't do predictions for this one because you can only do two
[5166.88s -> 5168.88s]  Um like one versus one
[5169.20s -> 5174.89s]  So with a three way, it would be hard to do we'll do for the next one though. I promise. Um
[5175.37s -> 5179.88s]  You know what the funniest part is I I thought that that was gonna be like the lamest
[5180.44s -> 5185.93s]  Match of the evening, but that turned out to somehow be like the best one so far
[5192.67s -> 5199.64s]  Match two is now over. We will now move on. What do they look like?
[5199.96s -> 5201.96s]  Why does it look like herman munster? I don't know
[5206.86s -> 5210.38s]  The the bat when they just kept trading the bat back and forth and hitting each other in the face
[5211.24s -> 5213.98s]  Oh god

[5585.04s -> 5591.28s]  Fucking sans
[5591.28s -> 5596.51s]  It should never have been in the game. It's not a nintendo character
[5597.15s -> 5605.57s]  Right behind you right behind him shit. I fell down

[5636.26s -> 5638.90s]  This is like this is the type of shit. This is why we can't get the fucking top 100
[5647.91s -> 5650.47s]  Well, uh, so
[5650.89s -> 5654.01s]  This one is the I believe the closest one of the of the entire evening
[5654.79s -> 5656.79s]  Uh, this one was by a margin
[5657.48s -> 5659.61s]  of
[5659.61s -> 5661.77s]  Like seven tenths of a percentage
[5663.02s -> 5666.30s]  So the two top ones are both 20
[5666.78s -> 5672.63s]  Percent and then something just to let you know, this is the closest one of the auto. Yes auto has awakened
[5673.56s -> 5683.35s]  Uh, I'm having fun
[5684.22s -> 5691.37s]  You having fun over there? He's just like rubbing his back like a bear on a tree and he's just sneezing
[5692.03s -> 5694.27s]  What are you doing over there?
[5694.27s -> 5696.49s]  Also, who do you think's gonna win?
[5696.49s -> 5703.07s]  Who do you think what do you think's gonna win best joke taking more than five minutes to set up cookies?
[5704.08s -> 5708.24s]  Uh, well, that's not that's not on the that's not a category auto. That's not a nominee
[5713.77s -> 5718.73s]  The winner of best joke of the year taking more than five was just pretty much best joke of the year
[5718.81s -> 5727.24s]  Let's just go for it. Ladies and gentlemen the winner with 20.86 percent of the vote
[5731.04s -> 5733.34s]  jigsaw house with
[5734.42s -> 5736.98s]  20.08 percent of the vote
[5737.00s -> 5741.67s]  Eating the shoe lost
[5741.99s -> 5748.44s]  Very close very close in third place was ah eu which I know that it's supposed to be five minutes
[5748.44s -> 5757.13s]  But I think that bit went on for like 30. So it was allowed just chillin
[5757.13s -> 5766.97s]  Uh, yeah jigsaw house 20 well 15.7 percent for ah eu by the way recency bias recency bias
[5767.85s -> 5774.67s]  Probably but you know, it's still fun. All right coming up. We have uh, let's take a look
[5774.67s -> 5779.84s]  I got another match to do but I want to take a break first. So we have how many was that?
[5781.57s -> 5786.05s]  The best joke so we had one two, three four one, two, three four one two. All right, so we have
[5786.71s -> 5792.18s]  Uh, we'll do two more cookies was robbed. Yeah, well, whatever
[5793.12s -> 5798.16s]  This is the two of the night that I think are going to be the most irritating to sit through
[5799.11s -> 5799.99s]  For a lot of you guys
[5799.99s -> 5802.39s]  So I just want to give you warning now some of you guys that might be new here
[5802.47s -> 5805.11s]  You might leave the stream in about two minutes
[5805.94s -> 5810.82s]  Uh, the next categories are going to be worst noise of the year and best noise of the year
[5811.06s -> 5813.06s]  And there were a shitload of nominees
[5814.37s -> 5817.33s]  The I there's like 20 nominees in worst noise
[5818.87s -> 5824.10s]  So strap yourself in and get ready to hear some of the things you don't ever want to hear ever again
[5826.90s -> 5832.08s]  There sure were yes, they were. Uh, so here are the nominees ladies and gentlemen for
[5833.68s -> 5835.68s]  worst noise of the
[5836.76s -> 5844.44s]  Year, you didn't even see me. I didn't
[5852.29s -> 5856.76s]  Okay, somebody squeezed a little too much air out of me
[5858.15s -> 5867.00s]  All right, this is cool. I'm gonna sneeze but I cannot mute my microphone
[5867.56s -> 5870.12s]  Uh
[5870.68s -> 5876.69s]  Funny man make a funny noise funny man make a funny noise. All right fine
[5881.75s -> 5886.23s]  I don't think I could hit a bong man. I really don't think I could in real life. I would probably fucking fall down
[5889.14s -> 5891.14s]  I would hit the bong. It'd be like
[5902.64s -> 5904.64s]  Also nominated for worst face
[5909.94s -> 5915.46s]  What are these um, well these like little like white things in the ground dude
[5916.92s -> 5918.92s]  These like flexibles
[5927.86s -> 5933.35s]  What I didn't get that guy give us a joke you got it
[5940.98s -> 5949.22s]  Did I do it
[5967.52s -> 5970.80s]  I think it's hitting him now. I got it
[5971.76s -> 5975.36s]  Cover it with cheese. The ooey gooey cheesy
[5975.60s -> 5979.76s]  Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Does it have like a bunch of fucking nacho cheese on it? Oh,
[5981.44s -> 5983.44s]  I know I get it, but it's still good
[5983.84s -> 5990.20s]  Oh, how can we make a how can we make like a caesar salad better?
[5991.89s -> 5994.85s]  Cover it with ooey gooey yummy cheesy cheesy
[5994.85s -> 5996.76s]  Cheesy
[5996.76s -> 6005.24s]  Germa is just a scary motherfucker. No, but I am I though I completely disagree
[6007.64s -> 6013.67s]  I disagree lick whale lord. Oh dude, that wouldn't be so gross
[6029.51s -> 6040.05s]  Where's he
[6045.04s -> 6047.48s]  Good
[6047.48s -> 6063.35s]  Oh, come on
[6063.83s -> 6066.15s]  No, excuse me. That was not a donkey sound
[6067.19s -> 6069.19s]  This is a donkey sound
[6074.52s -> 6078.76s]  Oh, that's one of those ducks at the store that you squeeze the dog toy never mind I tried
[6080.44s -> 6082.44s]  So many nominees
[6084.12s -> 6088.29s]  So many nominees for this category
[6089.62s -> 6096.77s]  But they can only be one winner, uh, they can only be three that are even listed so the winner of
[6097.81s -> 6100.53s]  The best noise of the year. No, no, no shit. That's wrong
[6100.53s -> 6104.69s]  It's worst noise of the year the winner of worst noise of the year is going to be
[6110.37s -> 6114.29s]  With 11.66 percent of the vote. We have ooey gooey
[6115.62s -> 6118.18s]  ooey gooey one with eleven point six
[6118.98s -> 6128.29s]  Six percent. Um, I think I you know, it's not even a noise. I just talked I just said a sentence
[6128.69s -> 6135.40s]  Um, I think it's just everybody hated the sentence therefore nominated it so often everybody voted for it. Um,
[6136.52s -> 6141.56s]  So after that very very close though with eleven point one six percent of the vote
[6141.56s -> 6145.88s]  So another very very close one even closer than the last one was the horrendous pig
[6149.36s -> 6151.54s]  So if you want to be a purist here
[6151.54s -> 6155.30s]  You could say that the horrendous pig was the worst noise of the year
[6156.20s -> 6165.03s]  And ooey gooey was the most hated phrase of the year after that at nine point. Oh five percent is chubaka transforming
[6166.63s -> 6175.83s]  I could see that I could see that. Yeah, I could see that acceptable. Yeah, that's that's an acceptable win
[6176.55s -> 6179.04s]  There are your winners. Uh
[6179.52s -> 6185.12s]  What's the next one right here? So just like worst noise we have best noise now best noise
[6185.97s -> 6189.33s]  Um doesn't no doesn't include anything like singing or anything. Uh, this is just what people
[6190.53s -> 6193.97s]  Thought was a better sound. I thought it was cooler thought it was funnier
[6195.00s -> 6197.57s]  the only thing I can't believe about this one is
[6199.20s -> 6201.20s]  There's a there's a nominee on here that is so
[6201.86s -> 6208.04s]  Ear screechingly horrible that I cannot comprehend why it is not in the other category
[6210.26s -> 6213.22s]  So just be aware. There is like ear scraping
[6213.46s -> 6222.93s]  There's like ear like a like a q-tip going in there and just like it's i'm just warning it now. Here we go
[6223.57s -> 6240.02s]  Nominees for best noise of the year wanted to warn you where's best noise
[6242.88s -> 6244.88s]  best noise of the year
[6255.64s -> 6261.97s]  You're never gonna get painfully clean like this
[6286.84s -> 6288.84s]  What's over there
[6291.80s -> 6294.68s]  And stop no whammies nobody tell her
[6295.56s -> 6302.62s]  Him i'm telling you what i'll hold that shit for me take a look at this scrumptious
[6303.64s -> 6305.64s]  cheese
[6316.28s -> 6318.64s]  Pizza
[6325.28s -> 6326.80s]  Neck thickness
[6326.80s -> 6328.48s]  Oh god
[6328.48s -> 6333.04s]  It's like I swallow. I like cartoon python swallowed a plate or something
[6335.80s -> 6337.80s]  My character right now is going like
[6339.32s -> 6341.32s]  And I want you to listen to that crunch
[6348.20s -> 6356.05s]  You were wrong you were wrong
[6369.09s -> 6384.36s]  Okay
[6384.36s -> 6387.76s]  The winner of the best noise of the year, I think
[6388.72s -> 6390.72s]  Won this like a year or two ago
[6390.80s -> 6395.67s]  I can't do this anymore either because when I do this people just vote for it people just nominate and people just go
[6395.67s -> 6397.12s]  Yeah, that's the one
[6397.12s -> 6399.04s]  Uh, the winner is
[6399.04s -> 6408.18s]  Well, I gotta play the fanfare
[6408.18s -> 6414.79s]  Didgeridoo at twenty point three six percent of the vote. So more than twenty percent of the vote didgeridoo won
[6415.67s -> 6419.91s]  Uh, and then doy doy which got fourteen point five percent of the vote
[6420.47s -> 6423.99s]  Which confuses me because the first time I ever did the doy doy thing
[6424.79s -> 6429.03s]  People screamed at me. They said stop that hurts my ears. I hate it never do that again
[6429.35s -> 6433.72s]  Don't ever do the doy doy doy thing ever again. And then two years later
[6434.12s -> 6436.12s]  I do the doy doy doy thing again
[6436.28s -> 6442.16s]  And all of a sudden now it's just second place for best noise of the year. What happened your tastes change
[6442.48s -> 6446.31s]  I'm gonna do it right now
[6459.35s -> 6467.59s]  There you go, oh and my ears won uh with eleven point five percent in third place i'm leaving don't leave please
[6468.55s -> 6470.68s]  uh
[6470.68s -> 6474.28s]  Eleven point five percent for my ears, which is the one that would hurt. That's the one that hurt
[6475.99s -> 6478.15s]  I think um, does that catch us up weird for another match?
[6479.60s -> 6485.35s]  After we take a break, let's see how caught up we was that was that four? I believe that was four
[6485.83s -> 6493.51s]  We had one one two three four one two three four one two three. Yes, we did. Okay. All right, let's take a quick break
[6493.75s -> 6499.46s]  I'll be right back. I'm gonna just get another maybe another drink maybe
[6500.36s -> 6504.12s]  Uh, see if auto needs to get anything see if auto needs to go out and i'll be right back. See you guys in a minute
[6504.28s -> 6709.65s]  Hey, hello
[6709.65s -> 6713.41s]  Hi everybody. I have returned to set up the next match in the rumble
[6713.97s -> 6719.94s]  So the next match is going to be a four-way
[6720.74s -> 6727.89s]  Uh tables, I believe tables ladders and chairs match be sus. Oh god
[6730.87s -> 6733.11s]  There always has to be a tables ladders and chairs match
[6735.72s -> 6739.56s]  Hear the crowd
[6739.56s -> 6741.56s]  Let me make sure the next one is set up

[6770.71s -> 6774.53s]  god
[6774.53s -> 6776.53s]  Tlc and it is between
[6777.33s -> 6783.72s]  a lot of different fandoms a lot of different fandoms here if you could think of a
[6784.92s -> 6787.08s]  certain group of people
[6787.08s -> 6789.64s]  that love a certain
[6789.96s -> 6792.28s]  franchise or certain characters you'd put them into a
[6793.46s -> 6803.28s]  Into a crew wouldn't you and we've had quite a few crews over the years, especially considering the last couple of years
[6806.08s -> 6814.85s]  The next match is going to be a four-way between those crews. So let me uh, let's go
[6818.98s -> 6821.30s]  Welcome back to the rumble portion of the stream
[6829.44s -> 6831.44s]  First character being introduced
[6832.08s -> 6834.52s]  Is murius
[6834.52s -> 6837.14s]  Of the moo crew
[6837.78s -> 6839.78s]  Also was nominated for best character of the year
[6842.88s -> 6847.96s]  Ooh 220
[6847.96s -> 6852.20s]  That's not the name of that animal is not mega milk. It is murius

[6866.26s -> 6867.78s]  Leash attached to him
[6867.78s -> 6880.32s]  I know how he gets when that's on him the anger leash our next competitor
[6880.96s -> 6885.00s]  Coming in here to challenge the moo crew and the other two
[6888.05s -> 6891.01s]  Are the wink dinks germa wink?
[6902.74s -> 6905.28s]  superstar, okay

[6911.68s -> 6916.80s]  To represent the wink dinks
[6916.80s -> 6918.80s]  Can you guess where this guy's from?
[6918.88s -> 6927.25s]  Coming up next
[6927.25s -> 6929.25s]  I wonder
[6932.64s -> 6935.20s]  I got you know, i'm gonna put my money on the dinks tonight
[6935.44s -> 6937.28s]  I think they have a lot riding here
[6937.28s -> 6940.32s]  They've been waiting for winks to come back for like a year and a half and they're just not coming back
[6941.04s -> 6945.04s]  Most dedicated fan base I think is but wait a minute. I'll be talking about dedicated fan bases
[6945.60s -> 6948.72s]  We're having a talk about dedicated fan bases. I think that's nancy dru
[6950.50s -> 6952.50s]  That's nancy dru
[6955.92s -> 6959.73s]  Representing the true crew
[6959.73s -> 6961.01s]  Nancy dru
[6961.01s -> 6969.27s]  With her atv looking to find a new part of a new clue for an old egyptian temple
[6970.79s -> 6972.79s]  Stumbled her way in here. She she knew
[6973.43s -> 6976.64s]  And she needed to be represented
[6976.64s -> 6990.92s]  But that's not all there's still one more group one more incredibly incredibly important group in this
[6991.64s -> 6993.94s]  channel in this universe here
[6993.94s -> 6998.18s]  You know, I talk about it all the time. I say it all the time. I address you guys as such
[7007.51s -> 7009.68s]  Still on nancy dru though
[7009.92s -> 7012.42s]  It's the banana brothers. Oh
[7012.74s -> 7014.74s]  And nobody seems to like the banana bros
[7015.38s -> 7021.64s]  this is
[7021.64s -> 7025.88s]  Everybody hates the banana bros. I why they boo with the banana bros
[7031.64s -> 7037.72s]  Somebody wrote oh my god, fuck this guy. All right, can I skip this? Can I skip this shit?
[7045.17s -> 7047.17s]  Everybody hates him
[7047.57s -> 7049.57s]  I love this guy
[7049.89s -> 7053.86s]  I love the banana bros
[7058.34s -> 7061.64s]  Murius the wink dinks moo crew wink dinks true crew
[7062.20s -> 7068.04s]  Versus banana bros fatal four way tables ladders and chairs match
[7068.92s -> 7071.32s]  Nancy dru is not wasting a single second of her time
[7073.88s -> 7077.80s]  Throwing murius into the ropes over the ropes now. There are I don't there are no rules here
[7079.46s -> 7081.89s]  zero rules
[7081.89s -> 7085.01s]  It's just whoever loses. Where wait, where are all the items?
[7087.28s -> 7088.72s]  Where are the items?
[7088.72s -> 7093.83s]  It's supposed to be tables ladders and chairs. I don't see a single table. I don't see a single
[7094.39s -> 7096.39s]  Ladder I don't see a single chair
[7100.56s -> 7103.25s]  You forgot to put them out
[7103.33s -> 7106.02s]  What are you serious?
[7109.32s -> 7112.28s]  Oh the banana the banana is getting absolutely bruised right now
[7114.77s -> 7116.13s]  Am I blind?
[7116.13s -> 7125.14s]  What do you mean? It's under the ring. Where are they going? No. No, I see up top up top up top
[7129.48s -> 7135.24s]  Holy shit. That was a big right hand overhead smash from murius out of nancy dru. By the way, whoever wins this
[7136.93s -> 7141.33s]  This is what I will call this channel's community for the next six months
[7142.56s -> 7143.84s]  so
[7143.84s -> 7145.84s]  Uh, there's a lot riding on this one
[7153.24s -> 7157.96s]  Big punching match here in the middle of the ring murius seems to have missed that double
[7158.84s -> 7160.84s]  twisted kick up
[7161.40s -> 7162.84s]  Boozled
[7162.84s -> 7163.88s]  What?
[7163.88s -> 7165.88s]  I kick a paloozle
[7169.32s -> 7175.04s]  Somebody get a table in here. Oh finally the banana bro is always taking the initiative
[7175.84s -> 7178.08s]  Reaching under the ring getting the first ladder of the evening
[7180.90s -> 7184.02s]  Yeah, one of the most dedicated one of the most passionate
[7185.06s -> 7187.06s]  fandoms on this channel the banana bros
[7189.76s -> 7193.84s]  He's gonna know he's not gonna be able to have any time the ladder was stolen by the winktinks
[7196.95s -> 7199.43s]  Winktink just wants to get up there. I don't think he was supposed
[7200.15s -> 7202.15s]  No, they're just setting it up ready to go
[7203.32s -> 7207.32s]  Nancy dru and murius have been outside this whole time just punching each other in the face
[7208.05s -> 7212.24s]  Oh, and she heard me. That was a huge kick from nancy dru
[7214.13s -> 7225.36s]  Leave oh ddt onto the ladder might see another uh might see a ladder set up here. Nope
[7225.84s -> 7228.07s]  Oh
[7228.07s -> 7231.83s]  Of all the things you could have done banana bro, that was probably the worst one to do
[7233.03s -> 7237.64s]  Murius setting up the ladder though murius thinking about get no murius is getting something else
[7239.64s -> 7241.24s]  Murius is going to get
[7241.24s -> 7245.16s]  One of the chairs over here. He went a long way to get that single chair
[7245.48s -> 7248.36s]  I hope it was worth it
[7248.36s -> 7253.72s]  Just like in black and white the ai is so bad with their pathing but he gets the hit he gets two hits
[7255.09s -> 7256.13s]  and
[7256.13s -> 7260.45s]  Nancy dru was just concerned about what was currently happening and murius
[7261.41s -> 7263.49s]  Fleeting up right now the new crew
[7266.95s -> 7274.52s]  Big elbow drop nancy dru was just trying to stop. She was looking at her dialogue options
[7275.00s -> 7282.39s]  One of them was please don't hit him. The other one was how much did that cost and the other one was
[7282.95s -> 7285.75s]  Where can I find the bar?
[7285.75s -> 7289.94s]  Murius is getting up to the top. No nancy dru throws him down
[7290.74s -> 7298.56s]  Kicking him right into his sternum both going outside again. There's an opportunity here for banana bros
[7299.73s -> 7303.41s]  Doesn't look like they're going to capitalize though nancy dru with a swinging neck breaker
[7306.82s -> 7308.92s]  But wink dink from behind nancy dru
[7310.82s -> 7313.44s]  Shit
[7313.44s -> 7318.88s]  And the wink dink he's he's signaling his crowd to do everybody to wink in the crowd banana bro. What are you doing?
[7323.86s -> 7329.30s]  He wanted attention. They're all just craving your attention. They're all just trying to get attention
[7330.74s -> 7332.74s]  They so badly want you to look at them
[7334.26s -> 7339.06s]  Moo crew moo crew banana bros. Oh this way banana bros banana bros out
[7343.60s -> 7347.28s]  Ladder set up again murius going in for a swinging ddt tornado style
[7351.04s -> 7354.80s]  Moo crew signaling his fans now to spam the chat room
[7357.72s -> 7361.48s]  Big right hand onto nancy dru swinging her around dropping down
[7362.28s -> 7364.28s]  And this opportunity is being taken by the wink dinks
[7364.68s -> 7366.68s]  Wink dinks are going up but murius
[7366.68s -> 7369.17s]  He's almost gonna get is he gonna get it
[7369.33s -> 7374.37s]  Murius going for the punch in the stomach is the wink dinks gonna win can the wink dinks possibly secure this
[7375.33s -> 7378.69s]  Three punches four punches in the stomach and here comes the banana bro
[7379.41s -> 7381.89s]  No, he's trying to push it down
[7382.61s -> 7386.47s]  Why is nobody trying to grab? He can't even push it down. He's not strong enough
[7393.14s -> 7396.02s]  What did he take it why did he take it
[7399.80s -> 7401.80s]  They're just running into each other
[7403.49s -> 7405.49s]  Big belly to back suplex by murius
[7406.53s -> 7411.01s]  Signaling the moo crew. He's ready. He's ready to have you guys be called that for the next six months
[7413.27s -> 7415.27s]  Nancy dru has finally gotten up
[7415.75s -> 7417.73s]  Finally getting back into the ring
[7417.73s -> 7421.49s]  It seems like ages ago that she was in this and she's gonna take the opportunity to go up nancy dru with the dru crew
[7421.57s -> 7424.13s]  Going up to the top rope going on top. She's got the briefcase
[7425.48s -> 7427.56s]  Is nancy dru gonna pull this off in the in the?
[7430.66s -> 7435.62s]  In the the absolute calamity going on nancy dru might have actually just gotten this
[7436.42s -> 7439.86s]  She can't do the mini game. Oh, she was always so bad at this one
[7445.52s -> 7448.88s]  Grabbing his arm wink dinks is throwing down murius
[7451.16s -> 7454.07s]  caught in the ropes
[7454.07s -> 7457.11s]  Wink dink is very strong right now murius has the most health
[7458.26s -> 7459.78s]  but uh-oh
[7459.78s -> 7463.78s]  Now wait, no, no, no, no, you got to get back in there banana bro. You can't just just you've got to get in there
[7464.58s -> 7466.88s]  You got to push that thing over right now
[7467.46s -> 7469.17s]  You almost got it
[7469.17s -> 7474.05s]  Push it over push it over. I don't want to call everybody wink dinks for the next six months. Don't push it over
[7474.53s -> 7476.42s]  Somebody get up there, please
[7476.42s -> 7478.55s]  Murius, please
[7478.55s -> 7484.42s]  Somebody stop it nancy dru run your atv into here and run it over. How is he still got this?
[7485.43s -> 7490.84s]  Banana bro's just like yeah, I don't understand this is fucked up big powerbomb
[7499.92s -> 7505.16s]  Why is she on the top rope wait, why is she sitting on the top rope banana bro got the ladder
[7505.88s -> 7511.08s]  Setting it up. Is this the banana bro's victory lap right now looks at nancy dru does not
[7511.72s -> 7515.56s]  Does not attack her she's on the top ropes. Is she gonna go for no?
[7516.12s -> 7520.21s]  That was the worst thing you could have done nancy dru. Oh catches him
[7521.01s -> 7528.53s]  Oh the skill the the app the just the necessity of that moment
[7530.34s -> 7532.20s]  She investigated
[7532.20s -> 7533.88s]  She took a look at her clues
[7533.88s -> 7537.24s]  And she found out that that was probably the best idea and maybe it's going to be a good enough idea to win this match
[7537.24s -> 7542.04s]  And be called the dru crew for the next six months nancy dru ladies and gentlemen has unlatched it
[7544.66s -> 7547.54s]  The dru crew prevails once again as they always do

[7886.74s -> 7889.62s]  Uh, I was told that that's not supposed to happen
[7889.62s -> 7893.70s]  I was told that that was just of like a 0.2 chance and I was told to do it again
[7894.10s -> 7897.38s]  And it happened again, and then I realized I was very angry with you
[7897.94s -> 7900.18s]  Uh, so yeah, then you got me twice
[7901.27s -> 7903.27s]  Uh, that was 17 percent. They were all still pretty close
[7904.28s -> 7909.51s]  No air left was 12.82 percent, which i'll be honest with you
[7909.51s -> 7913.67s]  That was probably that was probably the for me at least if I if I if this was no
[7914.23s -> 7919.03s]  Voting allowed here. Uh, that would be the worst one for me. I remember that very vividly
[7919.03s -> 7925.35s]  It was fucking horrible and then bunny in the room at 12.5 percent that one got pretty high because I mean I was like
[7925.75s -> 7930.77s]  Drinking right I had been drinking and it was just so easy just to get the shit out of me

[8031.54s -> 8033.22s]  All right, long story short
[8033.22s -> 8038.26s]  I can bring the switch to the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep and keep my hands close
[8038.74s -> 8044.02s]  And not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over
[8044.26s -> 8046.26s]  Okay, my nieces and nephews
[8046.90s -> 8049.54s]  Love lego star wars. It's like their favorite thing in the world
[8050.18s -> 8052.53s]  And I got a text
[8052.53s -> 8054.66s]  from my parents
[8054.66s -> 8056.66s]  and from my sister
[8056.98s -> 8058.26s]  that said
[8058.26s -> 8059.70s]  Hey, um
[8059.70s -> 8066.26s]  Just want to let you know the kids were watching your stream because they love lego star wars and we had to mute you
[8066.58s -> 8068.58s]  Because you kept saying fuck so much
[8069.06s -> 8072.50s]  Oh, it's the console. All right. Hold on. Let me show you the console
[8073.30s -> 8083.44s]  I don't whatever am I wearing beads on my wrist?
[8084.14s -> 8085.65s]  shit
[8085.65s -> 8088.20s]  Shit that you saw it
[8088.20s -> 8090.12s]  God damn it. It's
[8090.12s -> 8092.12s]  It's black tourmaline
[8092.36s -> 8098.36s]  It's like a crystal bracelet. I I i'm just wearing it because um, uh, it's a crystal bracelet
[8098.36s -> 8100.36s]  It's black tourmaline
[8101.16s -> 8105.64s]  And it's uh supposed to help with your energy. It's not it's made up like it's literally all made up
[8106.28s -> 8108.68s]  This is kind of how it's just kind of how I feel
[8109.40s -> 8114.12s]  It's like 40 percent of every day. Can I tell you that not like that? Not like that. Not like that. Not like that
[8116.04s -> 8117.64s]  So
[8117.64s -> 8119.64s]  What can I do for you?
[8121.88s -> 8123.88s]  Paseo del mar high
[8126.20s -> 8128.20s]  No, no, no, no, no
[8128.76s -> 8131.24s]  Oh my god, it's too bad. No, this is gonna be
[8131.88s -> 8145.88s]  I'm gonna make it more expensive. I'm gonna make it more expensive. All right, i'm gonna turn it off. I'm gonna turn it off
[8145.88s -> 8151.88s]  I gotta make it more expensive. I I I I remember i'm mid piss. I'm peeing. It's mid piss
[8151.88s -> 8156.12s]  It's like a 20 to 30 second full piss. This didn't even have it on stream 10 seconds into the full piss
[8157.25s -> 8159.73s]  I drop it right right it and i'm pissing on the phone
[8159.73s -> 8163.33s]  I'm pissing on the phone and it's in piss water into the toilet peeing on it
[8165.27s -> 8167.27s]  There we are
[8182.85s -> 8185.41s]  What happened okay, so
[8185.81s -> 8188.21s]  So what has happened is I press the back button
[8188.61s -> 8194.34s]  And this is when I uh when I searched for ai dungeon an hour and a half ago to play it and I spelt it
[8194.66s -> 8196.28s]  uh
[8196.28s -> 8198.28s]  Just a little a little incorrect
[8200.69s -> 8209.03s]  What what's this doing on here what's this doing on here oh shit
[8209.99s -> 8222.60s]  Where is this picture? What's wrong with this one? It wasn't on fucking purpose. I swear to god. I swear to god. I swear to god
[8229.83s -> 8231.83s]  Why are you doing this?
[8232.76s -> 8238.68s]  No, no, I just I just I just I just own the raving rabbits fucking ultimate party collection, which is every single video game they made
[8247.20s -> 8261.41s]  Come on what
[8275.01s -> 8277.01s]  Hey german on 85 here
[8281.01s -> 8286.44s]  Lee shit, this is something I can't show on stream
[8297.30s -> 8298.82s]  As you see
[8298.82s -> 8300.98s]  uh new category new, uh
[8301.78s -> 8303.46s]  new thing to
[8303.46s -> 8306.28s]  feed through right
[8306.28s -> 8308.48s]  feed through
[8308.48s -> 8310.48s]  Oh, he's getting zonked on stream
[8311.33s -> 8313.97s]  Uh, so the winner of the uh, best accident
[8314.98s -> 8316.98s]  He's fucking zooted
[8318.72s -> 8320.72s]  Best accident was you
[8327.08s -> 8329.08s]  Oh
[8329.64s -> 8334.28s]  Mother fuck
[8334.28s -> 8337.41s]  Okay. Anyways, the winner of
[8339.11s -> 8341.72s]  the winner of
[8341.72s -> 8346.20s]  best accident is
[8348.04s -> 8355.86s]  Wait, you didn't hear it. Come on at 18.5 percent of the vote chuck e cheese
[8363.20s -> 8370.29s]  I just keep thinking about that guy said over and over again, uh kissing chuck e cheese was at 18.5 percent of the vote
[8371.44s -> 8373.92s]  Uh, that was very bad very bad accident
[8374.96s -> 8378.88s]  If you were not here for that stream, like I said chuck e earlier chuck e cheese rated the stream
[8379.68s -> 8382.48s]  And was here and we were being fucking weird
[8382.88s -> 8386.00s]  And then somebody linked a picture of me kissing him and I showed it on stream accidentally
[8386.40s -> 8392.72s]  And he was here and he was hosting the channel. So that's a pretty big accident. Uh, that was 18.5 percent and then naked
[8393.43s -> 8399.49s]  Was 16.9. So that was it's still close. So just under 17 percent for naked and
[8400.37s -> 8408.90s]  Streaming and driving was 12.6 percent number three. Uh, I don't know. I'm not sure I agree with number three
[8409.22s -> 8415.27s]  I think i'm gonna put something else there. Uh, lego star wars was robbed
[8417.51s -> 8424.13s]  Uh, yeah, kissing chuck e cheese is the winner, which I mean that was a pretty horrible fucking accident. So, uh
[8424.77s -> 8435.12s]  What do we have left? That's not the final four. Okay, here we are. So this next one coming up is
[8435.84s -> 8437.73s]  worst meltdown
[8437.73s -> 8439.97s]  Which worse meltdown is different than a lot
[8440.53s -> 8442.53s]  it's it's hard to do worse meltdown because
[8443.62s -> 8447.16s]  So many of the nominees could be entire streams
[8447.56s -> 8451.80s]  so it's not necessarily just one moment or two moments or
[8453.03s -> 8455.19s]  It it could be the whole entire broadcast
[8455.51s -> 8459.51s]  So we kind of let it things pass where it could be just a full stream
[8459.67s -> 8466.45s]  So keep that in mind when you're watching these nominees 13 straight hours of it potentially
[8466.53s -> 8472.87s]  Yeah, uh here are the nominees for worst meltdown of the year either moment or stream in particular
[8491.72s -> 8494.28s]  I'm gonna lose
[8494.28s -> 8497.74s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. I just broke something
[8504.63s -> 8507.71s]  He's having a little cranky wanky right now
[8507.71s -> 8509.71s]  Oh
[8529.87s -> 8535.71s]  But we're at we're on the last fucking disc i'm so close to ripping it out and just
[8535.95s -> 8538.35s]  Frisbeeing it. How come my game's not doing that?
[8539.79s -> 8543.15s]  Flying fuck what the hell are you talking about?
[8543.95s -> 8545.87s]  Shit just you
[8545.87s -> 8548.03s]  I don't I don't know what happened
[8549.63s -> 8551.71s]  I didn't do anything. I just went left three times
[8555.07s -> 8557.07s]  I've already fucking lost my place. Oh, I
[8558.52s -> 8560.76s]  And then I don't know. I don't I don't I forget
[8561.79s -> 8563.79s]  I forget already. Oh
[8564.19s -> 8566.19s]  I'm gonna eat my fucking hand
[8566.57s -> 8571.93s]  Add this to worst meltdown of the year. I don't care. This job. I have to i'm gonna eat my fucking hand put it in the other
[8573.31s -> 8576.83s]  No, my god, i'm not pretending i'm not i'm swear to god

[8595.69s -> 8597.69s]  Dude
[8603.26s -> 8606.46s]  I was trying to roll it over to the fucking stupid time
[8608.30s -> 8611.42s]  Don't kill them kill them kill them kill them
[8615.58s -> 8621.24s]  No, oh get this away from my house

[8694.37s -> 8703.20s]  Oh
[8721.89s -> 8726.45s]  You see that button right there how it's made out of the most slippery fucking plastic notes, man
[8727.01s -> 8728.53s]  You see that button?
[8728.53s -> 8731.35s]  You see that shiny plastic ass fucking a button
[8750.16s -> 8752.53s]  Cranky wanky, right?
[8753.41s -> 8757.73s]  Uh too too many good ones. They were a lot this year. There's a lot of bad ones
[8758.37s -> 8760.37s]  Uh, but they can only be one winner
[8760.37s -> 8762.61s]  And I could have guessed this was going to be the one that wins
[8763.25s -> 8767.78s]  This is also, uh, not only does this win worst meltdown of the year
[8768.26s -> 8771.86s]  It also takes the cake for being the longest stream i've ever done and ever will
[8774.79s -> 8779.99s]  Lord of the rings the two towers, uh, that was a 13.4 13 and a half hour stream
[8780.87s -> 8787.01s]  It uh was hell from start to finish with 24 percent of the vote
[8787.49s -> 8793.91s]  Lord of the rings two towers underneath that you have super monkey ball with 19 percent and then super mario sunshine
[8794.55s -> 8798.90s]  At 17.7 percent cranky wanky
[8800.84s -> 8803.32s]  So there are your uh winners for worst meltdown
[8804.04s -> 8806.50s]  and now
[8806.50s -> 8810.37s]  We got another match. Let's move over to the uh wwe game
[8811.96s -> 8820.66s]  Match number four of the evening. Uh, this one you will be able to bet on I will just make that really clear
[8820.66s -> 8825.16s]  Let me just send the mods what they need to get you will be able to bet on this one
[8825.40s -> 8842.56s]  Let me just tell the mods who it is. I had to write that like six times
[8844.61s -> 8847.81s]  Okay, so this is a one-on-one. This is gonna be a one-on-one backstage
[8848.43s -> 8849.57s]  brawl
[8849.57s -> 8857.03s]  From what I have heard someone's going all in all in i'll be careful be careful
[8857.67s -> 8861.96s]  one-on-one backstage
[8862.04s -> 8866.31s]  brawl between none other than
[8867.03s -> 8869.03s]  Well, you're just gonna have to see aren't you?
[8870.71s -> 8873.11s]  Just gonna have to wait and see for it to load
[8873.67s -> 8881.52s]  And I will turn it back on I will tell you that this is uh, two very powerful beings
[8881.92s -> 8888.69s]  We have one of the most powerful current memes on the channel versus the potentially most powerful being on the channel
[8888.93s -> 8897.30s]  We're gonna have to see why don't we take a look right now?
[8903.38s -> 8905.24s]  uh
[8905.24s -> 8908.20s]  Wait, what they didn't even do it in the entrances
[8909.16s -> 8910.76s]  that's
[8910.76s -> 8913.00s]  That's germa dump truck versus jex
[8913.56s -> 8918.28s]  In a one-on-one backstage brawl. This is like an apahara movie
[8922.90s -> 8924.90s]  The dump truck versus jex
[8925.70s -> 8927.20s]  I
[8927.20s -> 8930.32s]  Don't know why they're out back and why he's just murdering him out back
[8932.55s -> 8935.11s]  Uh start the prediction, please. Who do you think is gonna win this match?
[8937.24s -> 8939.24s]  Why are they in some weird?
[8939.32s -> 8947.30s]  Germa dump truck seems to have all right into the table
[8950.15s -> 8952.15s]  I hope they use the outhouse to their advantage
[8953.86s -> 8959.54s]  Jex wearing his uh, his jex suit which gives him plus 25. Okay. He's already through the table
[8960.10s -> 8963.62s]  Do you have a dump truck just dumping on jex through the table?
[8964.92s -> 8967.72s]  Jex is he got so fucked up. He's got gray hair now
[8968.76s -> 8969.72s]  What?
[8969.72s -> 8972.08s]  He just broke his neck
[8972.08s -> 8974.08s]  You're going to have time to
[8974.16s -> 8977.12s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[9000.40s -> 9004.08s]  So many you guys just got so screwed you guys got so screwed

[9056.69s -> 9060.45s]  Send the money back. I think I don't know. I have no idea. This is a horrible scenario

[9076.56s -> 9079.04s]  I don't know. I don't know. It was because people could still vote
[9082.05s -> 9084.93s]  All right. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
[9085.99s -> 9091.91s]  We're gonna all right. Listen, we're gonna refund the money. We're gonna refund the money and we're gonna do it again
[9097.38s -> 9099.38s]  It happened too fast, dude
[9099.38s -> 9101.56s]  Oh and fade out
[9101.64s -> 9104.20s]  Okay. Well now that you saw that it's time for a rematch
[9105.27s -> 9109.03s]  It's too late. Okay. Well, whatever if we look at the ship that shit's gonna happen
[9109.99s -> 9111.27s]  Hey
[9111.27s -> 9116.39s]  All you guys that just lost right there. Here you go. You've got another opportunity because we're gonna do another prediction right now
[9117.03s -> 9123.08s]  We're gonna do the one right now same match, you know, what just happened. Do you think he can do it again?
[9128.84s -> 9131.40s]  Dump truck is too powerful. I don't is he though
[9132.04s -> 9138.12s]  No, there's like errors
[9138.60s -> 9140.28s]  on predictions
[9140.28s -> 9148.18s]  Whatever. Are we ready to do another prediction though? You guys let's do it again
[9149.35s -> 9151.35s]  This is for a german dump truck versus jex
[9152.21s -> 9158.37s]  Same place and i'm gonna give you time now
[9163.97s -> 9166.93s]  So you have an opportunity here if you think that jump truck's gonna do that again
[9167.73s -> 9171.17s]  Or if jex is gonna snap out of it here lose a little bit of that gray hair
[9172.36s -> 9173.64s]  And go for it
[9173.64s -> 9181.88s]  What do you guys think?
[9181.88s -> 9183.88s]  We're gonna close the prediction here
[9185.75s -> 9187.33s]  uh in about
[9187.33s -> 9188.85s]  I'd say a minute
[9188.85s -> 9191.59s]  One minute we can maybe close it out
[9191.59s -> 9198.05s]  You guys all know what's gonna happen
[9198.13s -> 9201.88s]  So are we ready? Are we ready to close it? Have you made your bets?
[9204.52s -> 9206.63s]  All right
[9206.63s -> 9209.11s]  Close that up
[9209.11s -> 9216.08s]  I'm gonna start it right now
[9216.08s -> 9218.20s]  Okay, are we closed?
[9218.20s -> 9219.40s]  my safe
[9219.40s -> 9226.37s]  To press this button
[9226.37s -> 9228.37s]  It has to run down the timer. Oh
[9231.22s -> 9234.58s]  All right. Well, I don't think that's gonna happen again. So I think we have I think we're good
[9235.14s -> 9239.36s]  I'm gonna wait till it gets down to like a third. Okay
[9243.83s -> 9245.99s]  Now i'm like scared. Okay ready in three
[9247.17s -> 9247.97s]  two
[9247.97s -> 9249.57s]  one
[9249.57s -> 9254.96s]  go
[9254.96s -> 9256.47s]  Rematch
[9256.47s -> 9259.91s]  Right off the bat jex with a clothesline all you have to do. You have to kill your opponent
[9261.19s -> 9263.19s]  All you guys that just bet against jex
[9264.37s -> 9269.49s]  Oh, I don't know. You still have an opportunity betting against but we saw dump truck kill him in two moves
[9272.82s -> 9274.26s]  just carrying him and
[9274.26s -> 9277.46s]  Dropping him directly onto his onto his big bulbous
[9278.16s -> 9285.35s]  Bunger burger, but that doesn't hurt him very much going over to the trash can here picking up a sludge hammer
[9285.97s -> 9289.54s]  completely misses
[9289.54s -> 9292.26s]  Ankle lock. No, no, no, no. No, he's going to what's he gonna do?
[9292.82s -> 9297.43s]  Take him right in the chest. They're being a lot more timid this time. They're not like instantly hurting each other
[9297.43s -> 9300.58s]  So maybe that this is better
[9300.58s -> 9303.54s]  dump truck versus jex right onto the sludge hammer
[9308.12s -> 9309.88s]  Why what was that sound?
[9309.88s -> 9311.88s]  That was like somebody getting shocked with a taser
[9312.53s -> 9314.21s]  It's like a stun gun
[9314.21s -> 9315.57s]  Uh-oh
[9315.57s -> 9317.57s]  This does not look good for jex
[9318.13s -> 9320.13s]  Remember, you just have to kill your opponent
[9321.38s -> 9323.70s]  With the steel no didn't steal it but he still hit him with it
[9325.92s -> 9327.78s]  That might have killed him
[9327.78s -> 9332.84s]  Nope, he's still alive
[9332.84s -> 9336.52s]  Jex is not even transformed by the way into super jex. He can only do that once every five years
[9337.92s -> 9339.92s]  Takes he's hitting with a skull
[9340.79s -> 9346.10s]  Big reversal by germa's dump truck. This looks pretty even
[9346.82s -> 9349.14s]  Look at those health bars. This is of anybody's match right now
[9353.56s -> 9356.07s]  I would love to see you outhouse
[9356.07s -> 9358.95s]  I would love to see going over to the outhouse and just like giving him a swirly
[9363.11s -> 9365.91s]  Punch right hand. No reversal right elbow
[9367.27s -> 9370.39s]  Triple elbow he hit his head on one of those he hit his head on one of those
[9371.03s -> 9374.07s]  He smashed his head on like a rock at one of those skulls
[9375.03s -> 9378.79s]  Completely missing a few times dump truck does not have eyes. He's just an ass
[9379.51s -> 9381.59s]  Remember he has to go by smell
[9383.11s -> 9387.27s]  Yep, I just said that I just did and I apologize to 22,000 people
[9393.65s -> 9397.97s]  This is looking bad for jex. That was a neckbreaker on the ground. The neckbreaker always is just deadly
[9399.41s -> 9402.37s]  Uh-oh jex is in a lot of trouble
[9403.09s -> 9406.71s]  For the second time in a row unless he pulls something out right here
[9409.24s -> 9414.04s]  Can we get any momentum at all from jex? He's just getting absolutely destroyed his health is almost at zero
[9415.59s -> 9417.59s]  And he's going to
[9423.81s -> 9425.81s]  Okay, jex's
[9428.64s -> 9430.64s]  Jex seems to not uh
[9432.00s -> 9434.00s]  Man, maybe jex is getting old too
[9435.60s -> 9438.88s]  Oh, no
[9438.88s -> 9444.00s]  Is my ass more powerful than the rest of my body at peak pinnacle condition?
[9445.38s -> 9447.38s]  That's what that whole bit was
[9449.89s -> 9451.01s]  Oh, well
[9451.01s -> 9456.32s]  Uh, that is it. That's open. That's another win back to back there from uh derma's uh derma's dump truck
[9460.00s -> 9462.00s]  Time to bring out super jex
[9462.32s -> 9464.95s]  He's screaming
[9464.95s -> 9467.19s]  All right, that is gonna take us guys
[9468.31s -> 9471.06s]  to
[9471.06s -> 9474.18s]  Uh, let me lower this we have the final four categories

[10271.89s -> 10274.53s]  Uh, which is actually very funny half of those moments
[10275.25s -> 10277.89s]  Are just sort of normal things that like a good gamer could do
[10278.69s -> 10280.87s]  but for us, uh, it's
[10280.93s -> 10285.35s]  Spectacular
[10285.35s -> 10286.47s]  the winner
[10286.47s -> 10288.47s]  Of best gamer moment of the year
[10289.03s -> 10295.14s]  I'm gonna pat myself on the back for this one. I think I did pretty well in the streams two of them, right?
[10296.08s -> 10301.27s]  Uh, the winner is
[10301.27s -> 10302.79s]  hades

[10305.91s -> 10311.54s]  Killing hades the boss on my third attempt. That was 26.6 percent of the vote
[10311.62s -> 10314.74s]  I mean, I think come on that that's worth a little bit of celebration
[10315.38s -> 10317.19s]  Just a little
[10317.19s -> 10321.35s]  Uh 26.6 percent and then rhythm heaven shooter pog was 14.9 percent
[10321.35s -> 10326.28s]  Also, I think I gotta give myself some credit for that one and then binding of eyes a god build
[10326.68s -> 10336.47s]  To kill mega satan with 10.8 percent of the vote was in third place cat sucks at hades
[10342.29s -> 10349.49s]  Uh, we have the final two categories here before the rumble and we have about 45 minutes before the ball drops in new york
[10349.89s -> 10353.68s]  Perfect timing because everybody is from new york on the rumble. So that's good
[10354.40s -> 10356.40s]  the last two categories of the year are
[10357.48s -> 10366.00s]  Worst stream of the year and best stream of the year two categories that could be a lot in them
[10367.09s -> 10371.73s]  I don't want to accidentally leak who wins. So we're gonna start with worst stream of the year
[10372.13s -> 10376.72s]  There's a few I could think of but I don't want to uh spoil anything for those that may not have seen
[10377.81s -> 10383.81s]  Uh, so here we go. Here comes the worst streams that I did in 2020 according to you

[10472.66s -> 10475.86s]  And I eat it on stream i'd rather do that than go back and do

[10595.62s -> 10600.05s]  All right. My tongue's fucking fucked up. Come on. Say it. Oh my god muck ass
[10601.36s -> 10603.36s]  minus 300 viewers
[10603.36s -> 10604.96s]  Look at it
[10604.96s -> 10606.96s]  600 people left. It's my fault
[10609.03s -> 10610.87s]  No, that's that's on them
[10610.87s -> 10615.72s]  Guys for all you know, 600 people just got like a fucking call and they had to get on a phone call
[10615.80s -> 10619.80s]  They had to go to like the doctor or something or they were going to eat dinner or it was not to go to bed
[10620.36s -> 10622.44s]  You don't know it's my fault. I had nothing to do with it
[10629.99s -> 10634.39s]  So yes, um, so hold on there we go. So yes, sometimes I have bad streams
[10636.64s -> 10639.41s]  Sometimes they can't all be good ones
[10640.05s -> 10642.05s]  They they can't all be good
[10642.13s -> 10646.18s]  Sometimes you have to have a couple of stinkers but uh by
[10647.57s -> 10649.57s]  No, you don't sometimes sometimes sometimes
[10650.03s -> 10658.08s]  Sometimes i'm gonna let that slide
[10658.96s -> 10661.51s]  It's your birthday
[10661.51s -> 10668.76s]  The winner of the worst stream of the entire year of 2020. I mean, okay
[10669.24s -> 10672.20s]  If it's the worst game of 2020, does that matter?
[10672.76s -> 10680.60s]  Does that actually matter too? Like what if it's the worst fucking game that came out in 2020 watch dogs legion?
[10681.84s -> 10685.44s]  Uh at 38.5 percent of the vote watch dogs legion
[10686.08s -> 10691.45s]  Took that by a lot, but the died allison counter was at 31
[10693.32s -> 10694.79s]  so
[10694.79s -> 10698.15s]  Really like almost 70 percent of the entire vote was those two streams
[10698.72s -> 10701.44s]  So you have to imagine that those are probably the worst ones
[10702.63s -> 10712.76s]  Uh ftk 2 was there at 13.2 percent way lower than the 31 from died allison counter. So 70 percent of you thought those two
[10713.24s -> 10724.04s]  I could probably agree you did tearless after watch dog. You did you did you did tearless after watch dogs
[10724.36s -> 10732.95s]  Did I but only like a few minutes though, right an upset. Well, then it's died allison counter. That's the next one
[10734.20s -> 10738.60s]  All right. We've made it to the final category of the evening and it's
[10739.24s -> 10744.13s]  It's the big one. It's the one that's worth all the money. This one's worth all the cash all the money
[10745.41s -> 10754.80s]  Best stream of the year i'm gonna peek might surprise a lot of you
[10755.20s -> 10757.84s]  This is probably going to surprise a lot of people here
[10757.84s -> 10762.00s]  It is going to be a lot of people that might be angry a lot of people that might be upset at this
[10762.08s -> 10768.95s]  Uh at what has happened here. We'll see it was very it was very contested
[10768.95s -> 10777.00s]  We'll just say that here are your nominees for best stream of the year

[10993.73s -> 11000.17s]  But i'm getting sources in my ear right now that apparently somebody threw mcchicken out the window

[11121.43s -> 11124.87s]  Oh, this is gonna be contested people are not gonna be happy about this
[11126.04s -> 11128.23s]  Well, let's just see what happens

[11183.30s -> 11186.37s]  Didn't win a lot of people thought that was gonna happen
[11187.91s -> 11189.91s]  Uh long drive with 27.4 percent
[11191.33s -> 11193.33s]  And I learned something about this channel
[11193.73s -> 11196.74s]  I've got to play more games with just fucking cars in them
[11200.95s -> 11211.30s]  Just need to be able to drive a car right up to the top of the list casino inc and third
[11211.38s -> 11214.90s]  I was surprised by that. I was um

[11217.86s -> 11220.52s]  But we now have the main event of the evening
[11221.99s -> 11226.41s]  What are we what we're about to do right now is finish the germa rumble 2020
[11227.76s -> 11235.28s]  With the actual rumble 30 participants the first rumble that has been on this channel in like two or three years
[11236.32s -> 11240.16s]  And i'm really happy that it could be done and be here for you guys to watch
[11240.66s -> 11242.82s]  Because i'm gonna enjoy it too. I'm gonna be watching right here
[11243.65s -> 11246.45s]  So let's take one more break before we're gonna count the the ball down too
[11246.45s -> 11250.05s]  We have like about 30 minutes that might actually happen in the middle
[11250.61s -> 11256.77s]  Of the game, so we'll see i'm gonna be right back one more time and when I come back
[11258.28s -> 11480.18s]  Rumble will begin see you guys in just a few minutes. Okay, so it is time for us to do
[11481.06s -> 11485.91s]  The rumble 30 participants enter only one can win
[11486.47s -> 11489.86s]  Hope you're all prepared
[11489.86s -> 11491.86s]  Maybe gotten another snack or
[11492.42s -> 11495.78s]  And I gotta actually pay attention here because the ball is probably gonna drop in the middle of this rumble
[11495.86s -> 11502.66s]  So I need to be able to have like a timer out here. Here we go. Give me a clock
[11503.94s -> 11508.16s]  All right. I have access to a clock
[11508.16s -> 11511.28s]  I do not want to show the game right now because it will spoil everything
[11511.84s -> 11516.88s]  So i'm not going to do that
[11516.88s -> 11527.17s]  I'm just gonna turn it on. Uh, if I can hold on a sec
[11529.28s -> 11531.44s]  I think i'm gonna have to resize the window
[11532.08s -> 11536.32s]  Let's see
[11536.32s -> 11539.68s]  Oh, come on
[11539.68s -> 11548.18s]  There we go. Okay. I need to get down here and turn the volume up because you guys can't hear it
[11550.02s -> 11552.20s]  There we go
[11552.20s -> 11553.96s]  Okay
[11553.96s -> 11556.72s]  All right. Let's go
[11556.72s -> 11559.46s]  Are you ready?
[11559.46s -> 11563.67s]  It is time the time has come
[11568.02s -> 11578.37s]  For the rumble portion. I'm about to turn it on in three
[11579.25s -> 11580.37s]  two
[11580.37s -> 11581.91s]  One
[11581.91s -> 11583.83s]  Here we go
[11583.83s -> 11587.78s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the wrestling portion
[11590.88s -> 11592.72s]  You know the rules
[11592.72s -> 11596.10s]  If you get thrown over the top rope you are eliminated
[11599.52s -> 11602.80s]  There is no re-entry and you have a random number
[11606.21s -> 11608.47s]  He will now explain everything I just explained
[11619.88s -> 11625.56s]  Superstars occur when a superstar is thrown over the top rope with both feet landing on the floor
[11626.12s -> 11628.28s]  The last superstar in the ring he's not even talking
[11629.72s -> 11632.52s]  Animatron up here and somebody's doing that from the booth upstairs
[11635.99s -> 11639.75s]  So who are the first two contestants in the 2020 rumble?
[11640.79s -> 11644.33s]  I don't know. We're about to find out. Oh, that would be the cheers to ucd
[11647.80s -> 11649.80s]  Gonna need some of that crowd
[11650.44s -> 11653.83s]  Hopefully does a great job
[11653.83s -> 11658.66s]  He's really hoping that he the crowd will get behind him for a change
[11659.46s -> 11661.46s]  Not him needing to get behind other people
[11661.78s -> 11666.92s]  with his audio tape
[11666.92s -> 11669.16s]  Cheers to you
[11669.16s -> 11671.16s]  We believe in you
[11673.67s -> 11675.67s]  We believe in you
[11676.15s -> 11678.15s]  But you're number one
[11678.15s -> 11680.31s]  So you probably won't do it
[11680.87s -> 11683.75s]  I will be shocked if you do cheers to you. Good luck to you
[11685.04s -> 11690.69s]  in this competition
[11690.69s -> 11694.80s]  So who is number two?
[11694.80s -> 11697.92s]  First two into the ring at the first moment of the rumble
[11706.21s -> 11708.21s]  Here it comes
[11708.96s -> 11713.11s]  Are you ready?
[11713.19s -> 11718.55s]  They're looking for the next contestant. I don't know where the next contestant is
[11719.19s -> 11722.47s]  Where why are they looking for the next contestant? They're supposed to come down
[11724.87s -> 11727.59s]  Well, no, everyone's excited. Of course they're excited
[11728.31s -> 11730.31s]  Because that's the mcdlt briefcase guy
[11739.35s -> 11741.35s]  Nailing all the way from 1981
[11742.15s -> 11744.15s]  During the pinnacle of the mcdlt
[11744.77s -> 11750.05s]  The guy in the front row that goes down drops to one knee with a briefcase in his hand and looks over and says cool cool
[11751.19s -> 11752.39s]  hot hot
[11752.39s -> 11754.72s]  incredibly powerful
[11755.17s -> 11757.17s]  And apparently incredibly sweaty
[11757.25s -> 11759.25s]  There's the mcdlt briefcase guy
[11763.25s -> 11765.25s]  I'm talking quarter pound of beef
[11765.57s -> 11768.39s]  Why is he out of the ring?
[11768.39s -> 11780.69s]  Did he just eliminate himself?
[11780.69s -> 11784.21s]  There's a serial killer behind those eyes. Well, I don't know much about that
[11785.68s -> 11787.68s]  I I just know that they're the two that start
[11790.60s -> 11794.70s]  USA here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the germa rumble 2020
[11795.73s -> 11798.69s]  New year's eve don't let oh, come on mcdlt is my favorite character

[11805.84s -> 11807.36s]  Why?
[11807.36s -> 11809.36s]  Oh, he's my favorite character
[11810.96s -> 11815.52s]  Favorite character somebody get here and just eliminate cheers to you. Oh, it's the pencil
[11816.79s -> 11820.15s]  The pencil is in the 2020 rumble. How is it possible?
[11820.87s -> 11822.87s]  the most hated character
[11822.87s -> 11824.87s]  The pencil was in the rumble
[11825.73s -> 11828.85s]  It's been like four years since we've seen the pencil
[11830.02s -> 11836.10s]  And cheers to you as just has so much power so much strength and nobody can even touch him so far
[11837.99s -> 11840.95s]  Oh my goodness a huge clothesline onto the pencil
[11841.59s -> 11846.39s]  We're gonna fill this ring up a little bit here. Someone's coming in at about 10. Good sweeping kick to the groin there
[11847.91s -> 11849.51s]  pencil has
[11849.51s -> 11851.51s]  Starting to dominate
[11851.51s -> 11853.51s]  And of course glue man coming in next
[11854.50s -> 11856.50s]  Glue man is your number four
[11858.29s -> 11859.81s]  There he is
[11859.81s -> 11861.41s]  With all of his glory
[11861.41s -> 11863.41s]  With his boston celtics boots
[11863.49s -> 11867.03s]  As the pencil rakes his eyes glue man now stuffed into the corner
[11867.75s -> 11870.31s]  Takes two three punches. It didn't even get a chance to show everybody
[11871.03s -> 11873.99s]  Now he's gonna reverse it cheers to you taking a breather here
[11874.47s -> 11879.75s]  After instantly eliminating my favorite character can the pencil be removed pencil is a former champion of the rumble, by the way
[11880.15s -> 11882.87s]  Really important for you to know. I think they're gonna double team
[11883.91s -> 11885.91s]  They are not going to double team
[11888.31s -> 11890.31s]  Dr smoochson coming in next at number five
[11891.32s -> 11893.59s]  as they're gonna oh

[11894.98s -> 11897.48s]  No, that doesn't count. Is glue man eliminated
[11904.77s -> 11906.77s]  Okay glue man is not eliminated
[11908.08s -> 11910.88s]  Dr smoochson comes in we now got four competitors into the rumble
[11911.36s -> 11914.00s]  A lot of you guys probably would hate to see the pencil win again. So would I
[11917.28s -> 11920.96s]  The crowded ring here it comes who is going to be number six
[11924.32s -> 11926.80s]  Toss him over toss him over. Oh, it's germa thing
[11927.68s -> 11929.68s]  germa thing
[11929.68s -> 11935.28s]  Being eliminated germa thing coming in from the game the thing see if we can get a good
[11936.16s -> 11939.84s]  View of his face glue man. You're never gonna win man
[11940.48s -> 11942.48s]  Glue man's just never going to win
[11942.80s -> 11946.72s]  We all have to be completely honest with ourselves. He's just he's a lovable loser
[11947.36s -> 11949.20s]  I'm sorry glue man
[11949.20s -> 11953.28s]  It doesn't matter if I give you a hundred in every step. You're gonna get thrown out in the first five minutes

[11958.07s -> 11960.34s]  well germa thing
[11960.34s -> 11962.34s]  Maybe not for long though. We'll see
[11963.24s -> 11966.04s]  I can't believe i'm seeing I cannot believe what i'm seeing right now
[11966.92s -> 11969.88s]  Gabe newell is coming in next and they're gonna double team eliminate him possibly
[11971.30s -> 11974.18s]  Cheers to you looking and he's got a valve index on he didn't
[11974.90s -> 11978.74s]  Instantly eliminates dr smoochson. Gabe newell is back and he is angry
[11979.30s -> 11981.94s]  For not being invited for the last three or four years in a row
[11982.50s -> 11984.87s]  showing off that index
[11984.87s -> 11987.83s]  Dr smoochson taking a huge. Oh, what is he doing?
[11989.12s -> 11992.56s]  Uh, dr smoochson dr smoochson just breathes in his own hand. Okay, that was weird
[11993.20s -> 11995.84s]  But gabe newell is looking for redemption in this rumble
[11997.35s -> 11999.51s]  If you remember the pencil and gabe newell
[12000.07s -> 12004.55s]  Had a huge rivalry and it looks like it's going to continue here as he gets dropped onto the top turnbuckle there
[12005.51s -> 12010.45s]  Number eight coming in is jigsaw with the gas the jigsaw doll
[12011.48s -> 12016.44s]  Derma thing on the edge of the rope there germa things gonna get eliminated. Oh, he's naughty holds on for his dear life
[12018.96s -> 12021.12s]  Pencil is going to eliminate. Oh, it's it's good

[12028.72s -> 12032.16s]  Cheers to you is still in it. He was the first competitor by the way
[12033.20s -> 12037.52s]  He got instantly gassed. He was coming to exit number nine. We got pac-man
[12038.66s -> 12040.66s]  Pac-man has entered the rumble
[12049.73s -> 12051.73s]  Gabe newell is still
[12052.15s -> 12055.09s]  Doing very well
[12055.09s -> 12057.09s]  Still got good green health
[12057.25s -> 12061.88s]  If I were him, I would go over in that corner. I would open up half-life alex and I would start chapter one
[12062.84s -> 12067.40s]  What a great game that wasn't what a great thing going after pac-man's back here
[12068.36s -> 12077.30s]  We're gonna have six competitors in the ring. And of course long drive dad is gonna make an appearance. He won best stream of the year
[12079.28s -> 12081.36s]  Why wouldn't long drive dad make an appearance
[12085.30s -> 12087.30s]  Can he sweep another category?
[12087.46s -> 12090.40s]  Called winning the rumble
[12090.40s -> 12095.06s]  big ddt there
[12095.06s -> 12097.86s]  Rings getting crowded. Yeah, it is cheers to you still in it
[12099.68s -> 12103.36s]  Big right hook onto long drive. Are they gonna fill more people in here?
[12104.00s -> 12106.00s]  Do not let this rivalry end this way game
[12106.64s -> 12108.80s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it can't end like this
[12109.52s -> 12111.52s]  It can't end like this
[12112.12s -> 12115.88s]  Oh game newell holds on for dear life as travis touchdown comes in
[12118.61s -> 12120.21s]  Making his way in
[12120.21s -> 12126.23s]  Can't wait for that new game and he'll be playing that new game as travis touchdown comes on in cheers to you
[12126.47s -> 12128.47s]  Did cheers to you is gone
[12129.88s -> 12133.88s]  Long drive dad has eliminated cheers to you the longest person inside the ring so far
[12134.52s -> 12136.52s]  He made it 30% of the way through
[12137.72s -> 12139.24s]  It's sorry
[12139.24s -> 12140.52s]  He didn't win
[12140.52s -> 12146.10s]  Because now gabe newell has got long drive dad using the groin drop long drive. That's gonna get tossed up by gabe newell
[12147.72s -> 12150.76s]  He's got extra strength so far and who's coming in now this is
[12152.12s -> 12154.12s]  fortnight jimmy's coming in next
[12158.80s -> 12160.80s]  fortnight jimmy on his way in
[12161.20s -> 12162.87s]  as
[12162.87s -> 12166.39s]  As gabe newell and the pencil both try to eliminate long drive dad
[12170.21s -> 12172.21s]  We were talking shit and he's ready to go
[12172.61s -> 12174.48s]  It doesn't matter
[12174.56s -> 12179.12s]  I mean, it doesn't matter. I mean, he's he's he's only 13 and he really shouldn't be in here with a bunch of grown like
[12179.20s -> 12182.80s]  44 year olds and like 29 year olds, but um, like whatever
[12183.60s -> 12186.42s]  It's okay
[12187.06s -> 12190.32s]  It's a full ring right now
[12190.64s -> 12195.20s]  Reversal by germa thing onto germa pencil. That's not a germa pencil. That's just the pencil he sucks
[12197.78s -> 12200.52s]  No eliminations somebody has to get eliminated
[12203.35s -> 12206.47s]  That's a fake up from germa thing if i've ever seen one. I told you
[12207.43s -> 12214.90s]  Long drive dad's going out right here. No, he got distracted by travis touchdown long drive lives again to see another minute here
[12218.72s -> 12220.72s]  Fortnight jimmy like in math class
[12221.20s -> 12227.68s]  Through his pencil down after getting a 100 on it long drive dad. He's dealt with he's here. He has kids of his own
[12229.33s -> 12231.33s]  He's upset about that one
[12231.49s -> 12234.85s]  He has a dad for god's sake. No, he can't eliminate him
[12235.81s -> 12239.17s]  As germa 985 enters the arena, but no long drive dad cannot
[12239.73s -> 12244.29s]  Eliminate fortnight jimmy but germa germa with a full body cast on
[12245.71s -> 12250.69s]  2020 has been a little rough on germa 985, but he still has got the strength of at least 10 people
[12251.89s -> 12255.03s]  He still has the strength
[12255.76s -> 12257.76s]  long drive dad
[12259.03s -> 12261.33s]  Long drive dad needs to be
[12275.70s -> 12282.74s]  Just drops down an elevator shaft germa 985 you weren't gonna win man. You're at like 60% still
[12285.78s -> 12288.82s]  Travis touchdown now is in a lot of trouble with gabe newell
[12289.78s -> 12294.18s]  Travis touchdown is stuck on the ropes. Somebody get travis touchdown out of here
[12296.07s -> 12298.07s]  I can't man
[12299.03s -> 12303.06s]  Fortnight jimmy's just
[12305.57s -> 12309.57s]  Long drive dad in the corner the right hand side corner travis touchdown trying to get rid of him
[12311.03s -> 12315.59s]  No, he cannot do what is necessary to throw him over pacman still with a lot of hp
[12316.87s -> 12318.87s]  Lots of health still
[12319.89s -> 12321.89s]  Germa thing's been in here for a long time
[12322.76s -> 12324.76s]  Gabe newell's been in here for a long time
[12325.56s -> 12329.56s]  And somebody else is about to enter while gabe newell's and nancy drew's coming in hot here
[12333.57s -> 12335.65s]  Earlier this evening nancy drew
[12336.45s -> 12338.45s]  Won the crew battle
[12339.03s -> 12341.67s]  Drew crew prevailed and obviously she's celebrating for it
[12344.82s -> 12346.82s]  big suplex here
[12347.43s -> 12349.67s]  On fortnight jimmy by germa thing
[12351.78s -> 12356.90s]  Yeah, drew crew has taken a few wins today and that's it for fortnight jimmy germa thing freaked out
[12357.70s -> 12364.50s]  And then another elimination gabe newell just destroys long drive dad people are gonna be really upset by that one gabe newell on the hunt here
[12365.30s -> 12367.30s]  Maybe going for a second elimination in a row
[12369.72s -> 12375.78s]  Nancy drew with a big boot getting some taunting by gabe newell
[12378.02s -> 12380.02s]  i'm, not sure what what he's doing here, but he's
[12380.66s -> 12384.10s]  Maybe they're gonna work together and try to eliminate travis touchdown while germa thing's in a lot of trouble
[12385.08s -> 12387.08s]  An incoming nexus from lord of the rings
[12387.56s -> 12390.45s]  You know him as the dwarf
[12390.45s -> 12393.76s]  Here comes gimli
[12393.76s -> 12396.64s]  Nancy drew that's a really bad place to be right now. You don't want to be taunting up there
[12400.36s -> 12405.32s]  And my axe and my what's going on with his hair his hair is a life of its own
[12409.38s -> 12413.86s]  Big maneuver big double punch into the elbow drop right on the top of the skull
[12417.16s -> 12419.88s]  Gabe newell is just working on to gimli
[12420.82s -> 12423.14s]  For some reason gabe newell has it up with the lord of the rings
[12426.00s -> 12428.00s]  Huge elbow drop wait what?
[12429.17s -> 12431.92s]  pac-man has been eliminated
[12431.92s -> 12435.68s]  pac-man has been eliminated from the rumble and travis touchdown might be right after
[12437.73s -> 12439.75s]  Oh, no
[12439.75s -> 12440.87s]  Oh, no
[12440.87s -> 12445.19s]  Gabe newell has just been eliminated by germa thing and so has travis touchdown. We're getting down
[12447.44s -> 12450.96s]  To the to the few here
[12451.12s -> 12455.91s]  Nancy drew you got to get rid of nancy drew she's currently running on the high
[12456.56s -> 12458.56s]  Of her victory with the drew crew
[12459.46s -> 12461.86s]  I think gimli and germa thing have to work together and get her out of here
[12462.18s -> 12467.88s]  Unfortunately, gabe newell could not get the redemption that a lot of you think he may have deserved
[12468.28s -> 12475.12s]  It's okay his wall dad's coming in an older competitor from the last rumble
[12475.76s -> 12484.40s]  Wall dad going right. Oh, no, what a reversal by nancy drew. What is germa thing doing?
[12484.88s -> 12488.13s]  He's just pulling his hair
[12488.21s -> 12491.16s]  He's not gonna just
[12491.40s -> 12500.42s]  He is wild he is very wild and untamed is gimli gonna get dropped here
[12501.22s -> 12503.22s]  No, not quite not quite
[12504.52s -> 12506.28s]  next competitor is
[12506.28s -> 12514.63s]  Of course a jar of mayonnaise one of the most delicious snacks one of the most delicious additives you could possibly put on any food product
[12516.04s -> 12517.40s]  good on
[12517.40s -> 12522.13s]  French fries, it's good on turkey sandwiches. It's really good in tuna if you make like a tuna sandwich
[12522.85s -> 12526.93s]  Jar of mayonnaise it'll in a little goes a long way by the way, you don't have to use a whole lot
[12527.17s -> 12531.75s]  It's really good on some other stuff, too. It's good. Well, hold on. We got some action here
[12533.36s -> 12538.24s]  Gimli is about to eliminate germa thing is wall dad gonna let this happen. He is there he goes
[12538.80s -> 12546.79s]  That is the end for germa thing and here comes a pasta italiano chef from casino ink
[12554.13s -> 12556.13s]  Fuck somebody said fuck nancy
[12559.36s -> 12561.04s]  pasta italiano chef
[12561.04s -> 12567.99s]  You don't know they've had plenty of uh, plenty of really bad things happen to the restaurant into them always the subject of
[12568.95s -> 12570.63s]  attacks and
[12570.63s -> 12574.52s]  uh mob hits but here now to try to
[12575.56s -> 12578.63s]  Use some of their own firepower
[12578.63s -> 12584.53s]  That was a really really big move by the jar of mayonnaise and bf bugleberry is now number 19 coming in
[12587.22s -> 12589.40s]  Please don't all of you leave
[12591.38s -> 12592.50s]  Oh, yeah
[12592.50s -> 12597.03s]  Oh, yeah
[12597.03s -> 12602.71s]  Going right for wall dad. It's gonna be instant. Yeah, there he goes
[12604.55s -> 12606.79s]  That was very violent from bf bugleberry
[12607.65s -> 12611.09s]  Trying to get rid of the jar of mayonnaise nancy drew and bf bugleberry working together
[12612.87s -> 12617.67s]  And nope, it's he's very thick. He's very full of vitamins and minerals
[12618.15s -> 12621.11s]  You can't just get rid of mayonnaise that quickly don't pour it down the drain either
[12621.43s -> 12625.64s]  Throw it in you gotta like scoop it up and throw it like the trash and stuff. It can't go down the drain
[12627.51s -> 12636.50s]  Beanbag sonic has just entered the rumble and he's grown up now. He's not just a little shit anymore. He's a huge
[12637.71s -> 12638.93s]  muscly
[12638.93s -> 12640.93s]  fully evolved level 10
[12641.72s -> 12647.57s]  Monster rancher monster. It's been quite a while since we've seen beanbag sonic
[12648.05s -> 12655.08s]  He's been training and there goes the pasta italiano chef by gimli gone almost as fast as he came in
[12655.56s -> 12661.94s]  And here comes mr. Green
[12661.94s -> 12665.75s]  What is the jar of mayonnaise doing mr. Green coming in?
[12666.31s -> 12668.31s]  Looks like he lost his pants
[12668.63s -> 12671.19s]  In a game of poker, but he's here
[12674.52s -> 12678.84s]  Bf bugleberry gets dumped over and nancy drew gets eliminated. Oh no
[12679.80s -> 12682.04s]  I had high hopes for nancy drew. I thought she was going to go a long way
[12682.04s -> 12684.28s]  But mr green is on an absolute tirade here
[12685.62s -> 12686.90s]  He was so strong
[12686.90s -> 12692.92s]  He just picked up a level 10 monster rancher fully developed monster and just drew it like it was a fucking piece of cheese
[12693.24s -> 12699.73s]  Gimli is still sticking around. Look at that health though. Not doing well
[12703.65s -> 12706.15s]  Oh, nope. What are they doing?
[12709.64s -> 12711.30s]  What was that?

[12713.67s -> 12716.71s]  And here comes chuck e cheese at number 22
[12717.97s -> 12721.17s]  Big power bomb on mr. Green from the jar of mayonnaise chuck e cheese

[12728.31s -> 12734.39s]  Favorite rat I could probably name a few that go in front. Um, jerry from ratatouille
[12735.57s -> 12738.52s]  Giant rat that makes all the rules. Um
[12739.72s -> 12741.80s]  Tom no jerry from tom and jerry

[12811.38s -> 12813.54s]  Get rid of gimli. He's doing too good

[13149.16s -> 13151.16s]  Juggles the great is your final competitor
[13155.97s -> 13157.97s]  Looks like he's got a full belly
[13158.21s -> 13160.84s]  Sitting in his underwear
[13160.84s -> 13165.72s]  And who did catboy germa just eliminate? Who just got eliminated?
[13167.96s -> 13174.92s]  Seaman just got eliminated by catboy germa and goodbye catboy germa gotcha red with a major big elimination there
[13177.68s -> 13180.72s]  A high hope for catboy germa, but it didn't happen
[13183.14s -> 13184.80s]  Unfortunately
[13184.80s -> 13190.80s]  And juggles the great comes right in against a ddt and germa's dump truck is just like splitting that ass right on the turnbuckle
[13190.80s -> 13194.16s]  He don't care

[13207.83s -> 13210.31s]  No, I don't think he can do it. He's not strong enough
[13212.74s -> 13214.74s]  Not strong enough
[13218.60s -> 13221.72s]  Gotcha red is still holding on for dear life
[13222.28s -> 13224.28s]  And he still has pretty decent health
[13225.11s -> 13226.87s]  His health is pretty good
[13226.87s -> 13232.08s]  It's going to be really hard to eliminate gotcha force g red
[13233.46s -> 13236.34s]  Greatest game cube game ever made and it's also the most expensive
[13237.06s -> 13244.34s]  It's like three hundred dollars to buy that game goodbye beanbag sonic. That's it. That was such an opportunity
[13244.34s -> 13249.12s]  That's such a disappointment huge disappointment beanbag sonic is out
[13252.87s -> 13256.26s]  This looks like it's going to come down
[13256.34s -> 13257.30s]  to
[13257.30s -> 13263.09s]  g red and somebody
[13263.09s -> 13267.01s]  Juggles the great going for a big punch not enough to knock him down though chuck e cheese

[13288.92s -> 13290.72s]  Oh, no
[13290.72s -> 13298.64s]  Gotcha red with a big comeback. He's gonna dump him g red

[13305.01s -> 13307.65s]  No, he's it's not enough to dump chuck e cheese
[13310.37s -> 13319.11s]  Here it is being back sonic in the background. Here are your final three who could be crowned the 2020 champion of the 2020

[13352.15s -> 13354.55s]  I thought he was gonna throw him directly over the ropes
[13356.29s -> 13359.73s]  Did you see you see the momentum you see the excitement in that grab?
[13366.40s -> 13368.40s]  He's gonna prove to everybody once and for all
[13370.04s -> 13372.26s]  That this was worth streaming
[13372.26s -> 13376.53s]  And then it was a great game. Is he gonna do it?
[13377.25s -> 13386.26s]  Can he dump him? Can he dump juggles? Is g red going to win the rumble? No, it's not enough juggles with the reversal
[13389.88s -> 13392.12s]  Oh, no, he's getting slow
[13392.12s -> 13398.84s]  He's slowing down. It's gonna take a miracle big belly to belly suplex, but juggles is red, too
[13399.68s -> 13401.68s]  Uh-oh, he's going for the fucking belly shake

[13432.02s -> 13435.80s]  huge clothesline
[13435.88s -> 13442.44s]  Gotcha red. He's got only two percent battery left on his fucking phone. Please plug it in for god's sakes. You're killing us
[13444.05s -> 13447.49s]  I'm sick of you sending me screenshots with four percent battery, dude, please

[13601.64s -> 13609.01s]  Wait, it's not gonna do the same exact stuff, right? It's the same exact participants coming in
[13615.30s -> 13625.14s]  Yeah, we gotta shuffle this yeah, we gotta shuffle this so that we can't have the whole thing happen
[13625.38s -> 13633.04s]  All right. Give me a sec. What do you think should we add you want to add a couple of ritz brothers?
[13633.28s -> 13649.44s]  What do you think add add majima and kiro? Okay, we'll we'll yeah
[13649.44s -> 13660.08s]  We'll just just watch me do this. All right, so it doesn't really matter who comes in first
[13660.16s -> 13665.09s]  What do you think we'll add? I mean beanbag sonic you can do random. That's good
[13666.64s -> 13678.15s]  Participants, let's add everybody. Uh, if you add big banana, you see like this that's
[13681.62s -> 13693.72s]  Big banana go in. All right. This by the way, this is not the order. This is i'm just putting people in fortnight
[13695.08s -> 13697.96s]  Yeah, oh andy mark's already in it. Okay, let's go like this
[13699.30s -> 13704.95s]  Put the green screen in uh, the green screen is not in this game. Uh, this is i've got 2020
[13704.95s -> 13709.11s]  This is not 2018 anymore, which is kind of funny because 2018
[13710.12s -> 13718.40s]  Uh, it's probably like a better game. What about glue man? Yeah, i'll put him in
[13722.44s -> 13728.13s]  Just make him make him now leave roman reigns in
[13728.69s -> 13731.38s]  No, why?

[13751.43s -> 13759.03s]  Please germa, please do it do it now. Where was he? Why was he not in the rumble? What?
[13759.43s -> 13765.17s]  I was wondering there are two or three people that were missing
[13765.91s -> 13784.24s]  Who else was missing from the rumble? Oh no longer counts. We didn't have all the competitors. Oh shit
[13784.32s -> 13793.81s]  All right, that's no that's accurate. I yeah, I was wondering like what way did what happened?
[13793.81s -> 13804.90s]  What happened to joel? I made joel and like put him in yeah, it's time for a rematch. I hope joel fucking wins now
[13805.14s -> 13809.81s]  oh, you know what it was it's probably because
[13812.64s -> 13818.71s]  Wink dink was not supposed to be in the rumble that was supposed to be joel because they already had their match
[13819.03s -> 13829.17s]  So yeah, that's what happened. All right, what do you obviously long drive dead? What about cat boy?

[13906.42s -> 13911.36s]  But you don't think that he's like one of the strongest people here. What are you talking about?
[13915.33s -> 13919.24s]  Is that seriously a question that you're asking put germa back in?
[13920.93s -> 13930.45s]  Remove the writs brother. All right, fine. Take juggles out. He already won. That's a good idea. That's a good point

[14104.42s -> 14109.65s]  Here comes the redo. Well, not really redo more of a an encore
[14115.35s -> 14118.31s]  Jigsaw is going to have fun in it looks like mr
[14118.31s -> 14120.79s]  Green and germa thing are the first two contestants in the ring
[14124.18s -> 14129.46s]  And in all these wwe games, uh, if you're not in the last like 10 to 15 people

[14131.94s -> 14137.56s]  So enjoy the time they have in here now because they're going to be gone in about two to three minutes
[14138.04s -> 14145.12s]  But that's mr green and that's germa thing

[14166.92s -> 14173.51s]  Everybody loves andy mark trying to get rid of mr. Green and they do
[14178.63s -> 14179.59s]  Nobody fucks with mr
[14179.59s -> 14180.63s]  Green

[14189.44s -> 14191.44s]  How do I give him like extra points?
[14192.72s -> 14199.68s]  The mcdlt briefcase guy is in at number four
[14203.08s -> 14206.28s]  I mean, they all have good stats. The only one that didn't have good stats was um
[14206.92s -> 14216.15s]  Like fortnight jimmy has like under 70. I think he's the only person a hundred stats
[14217.81s -> 14222.93s]  No, he doesn't have a hundred staff dave newell at number five

[14951.57s -> 14954.69s]  There goes long drive dad and in comes glue man at number 18
[14958.77s -> 14962.77s]  Is this the opportunity for glue man to at least get a win here? Is this the opportunity?
[14966.26s -> 14975.44s]  So far not so good
[14975.44s -> 14977.92s]  This is the spot you want to be and it's going to be one of these people here
[14978.56s -> 14983.64s]  All right, you know what? All right, here you go. I think a bean bag sonic's gonna win this I think

[15046.42s -> 15048.98s]  No, he's gonna get from behind glue man
[15049.86s -> 15053.02s]  He's gonna keep just punching him over and over and over again in the corner
[15053.98s -> 15060.74s]  What did you do
[15068.33s -> 15072.25s]  Big but
[15072.25s -> 15074.55s]  He's I can't even talk

[15118.68s -> 15122.39s]  Did he fall down on the way in here?
[15129.11s -> 15131.35s]  Big banana bro looks like he's gonna be throwing up majima
[15133.21s -> 15135.21s]  No, they both want to get rid of majima

[15633.46s -> 15637.56s]  Oh my god
[15638.20s -> 15642.36s]  Oh, no
[15642.36s -> 15645.16s]  Nancy drew and dump truck are the last two
[15647.24s -> 15649.24s]  Who will win the encore?
[15652.47s -> 15655.99s]  I got my money on nancy drew. It's gonna be nancy drew. This is it
[15656.63s -> 15659.75s]  This is gonna be the end. She's gonna dump him. She's gonna dump him over. It's over
[15660.65s -> 15661.69s]  That's it

[15665.43s -> 15667.43s]  of the 2020 encore rumble
[15669.82s -> 15679.03s]  Nancy drew is your winner
[15682.58s -> 15691.21s]  Dumped the truck now. It's nancy versus juggles for the real winner. It sounds like a good idea to me
[15691.77s -> 15698.29s]  What are the rules?
[15698.29s -> 15703.94s]  Congratulations. Uh, congratulations nancy drew put him in a cage
[15704.89s -> 15714.02s]  And this is a bet. This is gonna be a big bet guys. Here comes a big prediction put him in a cage match
[15714.10s -> 15721.53s]  Hell in a cell, okay
[15721.53s -> 15751.59s]  Put him in a hell in a cell nancy drew coming in versus uh juggles nancy drew seems to have the advantage
[15751.91s -> 15763.51s]  Select arena sure why not run down high school gym here comes the person
[15763.59s -> 15770.63s]  I mean you can this is probably gonna last a little while hell in a cell this determines the real
[15771.48s -> 15782.84s]  Victor the real champion of germa rumble 2020 our predictions live right now. They are this is a big one
[15787.38s -> 15788.90s]  Go to match options
[15788.90s -> 15803.94s]  No, we're not doing big head mode. You went all in. All right, do big head mode do it
[15807.66s -> 15816.57s]  We can't do big head mode. Not right now. No big head mode. No, this is the championship
[15819.97s -> 15828.57s]  36 million on who what do you get you get? This is a major major difference here
[15829.11s -> 15840.39s]  68 percent of you guys are putting all your money on nancy drew. Okay, see if you guys are right
[15840.63s -> 15862.57s]  I'm gonna get started now. Let me bet. Oh, you gotta bet right now. You gotta use channel points man. It's closed
[15862.89s -> 15866.46s]  Let's go here comes the champion
[15867.29s -> 15872.04s]  Of the 2020 rumble nancy drew or juggles the great
[15880.04s -> 15882.62s]  main event
[15882.62s -> 15884.94s]  hell in a cell in a random rundown high school
[15885.90s -> 15898.00s]  Nice start by nancy drew didn't even wait a second kind of hard to see through this cage though underdog
[15900.78s -> 15902.06s]  Uh-oh
[15902.06s -> 15904.82s]  How do you win a hell in a cell you have to pin right?
[15909.96s -> 15914.84s]  I would laugh so hard. That was it. I would fucking shit my pants if that was seriously how it ended
[15915.94s -> 15920.98s]  Oh man, nancy drew even has better stats. It doesn't matter. Sometimes momentum is all that matters
[15925.91s -> 15927.91s]  There we go. Nice reversal
[15929.38s -> 15933.90s]  Switching it up a little bit here
[15933.98s -> 15940.02s]  What?
[15940.02s -> 15942.02s]  The silence is deafening
[15942.26s -> 15948.73s]  Yeah, it's just like, you know, these two people are kind of just throwing kind of just moving their bodies around and like landing on their backs
[15957.43s -> 15959.43s]  Health is not that big of a deal though
[15959.43s -> 15961.03s]  This is depressing
[15961.03s -> 15963.38s]  Quite the main event
[15963.38s -> 15965.38s]  Yeah, let's go
[15965.54s -> 15969.58s]  Get him
[15974.66s -> 15978.87s]  Why is there even a referee in here? Why is there a referee in here?
[15979.27s -> 15986.52s]  The fuck
[15986.52s -> 15988.36s]  That would not even hurt
[15988.36s -> 15990.60s]  You just landed on your back while holding his legs
[15996.49s -> 15998.49s]  Going for the pin. Is it possible?
[16000.02s -> 16001.54s]  Will they use the cage?
[16001.54s -> 16003.78s]  Somebody get up on top of the cage
[16012.46s -> 16013.82s]  oof
[16013.82s -> 16015.82s]  Get on top of the cage somebody climb the cage
[16024.54s -> 16027.18s]  It really is so depressing without like fans and
[16028.14s -> 16029.16s]  like
[16029.16s -> 16036.42s]  sounds besides
[16036.42s -> 16039.46s]  On the undertale ost. I think this is it for nancy drew by the way
[16040.74s -> 16043.22s]  This is it
[16043.22s -> 16045.99s]  Yeah, that's it. It's laughing the belly
[16047.24s -> 16054.90s]  You know cc's victory juggles has the momentum though
[16056.04s -> 16057.75s]  That could be it
[16057.75s -> 16064.46s]  One no one count. She just did the undertaker recovery
[16065.02s -> 16068.15s]  Come on nancy
[16068.15s -> 16070.92s]  into the cell
[16070.92s -> 16072.92s]  Not I guess not strong enough to knock him. Oh
[16077.26s -> 16078.84s]  Oh
[16078.84s -> 16080.68s]  Oh
[16080.68s -> 16081.96s]  Not good
[16081.96s -> 16088.74s]  Not good for nancy drew
[16088.82s -> 16092.90s]  What are you doing?
[16094.86s -> 16099.02s]  It can't be how it ends
[16099.34s -> 16105.86s]  Oh, this is so dumb nancy fight back
[16108.06s -> 16110.58s]  Fight back nancy
[16110.58s -> 16113.27s]  fight back
[16113.27s -> 16115.51s]  No, that's it
[16120.60s -> 16124.04s]  Juggles the great ends up winning and ends up taking the crown
[16125.16s -> 16128.20s]  Or actual germa rumble 2020 winner
[16134.28s -> 16138.20s]  Oh that what an upset 70% of you guys got it wrong
[16142.10s -> 16144.10s]  That's it
[16144.94s -> 16146.94s]  That was like the weird dog crawl
[16148.60s -> 16154.71s]  He is a superstar juggles the great congratulations
[16158.70s -> 16161.74s]  Oh, man
[16161.74s -> 16164.38s]  Do a best out of three. No, no, no best out of three
[16170.42s -> 16173.22s]  Worst character what juggles is a great character
[16176.42s -> 16178.90s]  How about super juggles versus super nancy drew?
[16180.42s -> 16191.16s]  No, I want to talk about this for just a second
[16192.20s -> 16193.88s]  so you probably noticed
[16193.88s -> 16195.64s]  that the
[16195.64s -> 16199.56s]  Awards this year. There was a lot more categories to put uh nominations in
[16200.60s -> 16202.76s]  But you didn't see a bunch of those categories
[16204.10s -> 16209.14s]  It was like another eight or nine categories that uh were not added to this particular stream
[16209.78s -> 16211.46s]  and the reason why
[16211.46s -> 16212.58s]  is
[16212.58s -> 16214.58s]  It was gonna be like too much to do
[16214.66s -> 16221.05s]  I didn't want to put a bunch of that on the editor and editors to make like 30 plus videos. So what we're gonna do
[16221.69s -> 16226.90s]  Is stalling but uh, i'm describing what we're gonna do
[16227.46s -> 16232.30s]  We're gonna do an encore awards night that are the sort of extra
[16233.02s -> 16240.65s]  Categories that's probably not gonna happen for a little while because I want people to be able to vote on it
[16241.83s -> 16245.67s]  So I would assume probably in the next like week or two. We'll do a sort of like little encore
[16246.39s -> 16253.14s]  For like an hour or so and we'll just do the other ones not like as flashy or anything
[16253.86s -> 16257.22s]  We might not even need videos for it. It'll be just fun to kind of look at it though
[16257.78s -> 16264.36s]  We'll see give us back our points
[16272.15s -> 16274.15s]  Give us back the points
[16275.94s -> 16277.94s]  I kind of like the idea. Hold on. Let's do
[16280.89s -> 16282.01s]  Let me see
[16282.01s -> 16288.12s]  I kind of want to I want to see someone so you can do like a custom match
[16289.42s -> 16297.70s]  Oh, wait, and he can't didn't they add something?
[16298.81s -> 16308.89s]  No, I want to do a table match. Who's like the strongest in here. I want to do a no not fortnight jimmy
[16308.89s -> 16317.11s]  No, no, no, we're getting away from fortnight jimmy. Well, you want catboy germa versus me? Okay, we'll do that
[16319.50s -> 16321.98s]  Catboy germa versus germa nine eight five
[16323.22s -> 16330.42s]  Oh, no, no, no against mcdlt. That's a good idea 100 fucking stats
[16331.88s -> 16344.07s]  Okay, so no against me die, but mcdlt is my favorite character fine fine fine fine fine fine fine
[16344.47s -> 16352.44s]  Look, i'm so terrible. I'm still gonna win
[16363.22s -> 16365.22s]  Catboy germa in all capitals by the way
[16371.70s -> 16373.37s]  Bets
[16373.37s -> 16382.01s]  You want to do bets? Let's go go for it. Let's do another prediction catboy germa versus germa nine eight five
[16385.10s -> 16393.24s]  I mean you saw the stats. This is going to be an absolute shit show. I lost everything
[16394.12s -> 16395.56s]  No
[16395.56s -> 16400.10s]  You lost everything
[16407.94s -> 16411.46s]  With nancy drew we said that with nancy drew. That's right. I could just come back here
[16411.46s -> 16413.46s]  And by the way, it's if you get broken through a table
[16414.01s -> 16418.54s]  You just have to go through the table. There's no pinning to whoever goes through it first
[16424.48s -> 16428.87s]  2021
[16428.87s -> 16431.91s]  Yeah, we were in the middle of the rumble, but happy new year guys
[16433.30s -> 16436.06s]  I know that this year has like sucked
[16436.06s -> 16441.85s]  For many reasons. Let's really hope that 2021 is better
[16443.16s -> 16445.16s]  Let's put it off to a good start. You know what I mean?
[16446.41s -> 16461.42s]  Because shit was rough was really rough in 2020 catboy germa is gonna win every time
[16463.08s -> 16466.28s]  You have to you have to cosplay as catboy germa if he wins
[16468.17s -> 16470.89s]  I have to cosplay as catboy germa if he if they win
[16474.46s -> 16477.61s]  Um, i'm going up against my like broken
[16478.98s -> 16480.98s]  wrapped up body cast
[16481.22s -> 16484.70s]  Character what?
[16484.70s -> 16489.90s]  Oh, hold on a second there. Wait a minute. Let's make this interesting. Why don't we make this interesting?
[16490.38s -> 16496.87s]  Why don't we so if
[16498.20s -> 16506.01s]  If catboy germa wins, I will dress up like a catboy if germa 985 wins
[16508.60s -> 16532.02s]  You shave a billion dollars off that fucking debt. I want a billion off that debt deal a deal. We got a deal
[16532.74s -> 16533.62s]  Okay
[16533.62s -> 16535.86s]  Oh, i'm fucking ready for this one. Let's go

[16874.01s -> 16880.14s]  No, i'm sorry. I just I just tapped you a little bit. I'm not doing that. I know when to stop. That's it shave it off
[16882.17s -> 16899.26s]  Not doing that's too nope I win so many 50 million points. Oh my god double or nothing to wipe the whole thing
[16900.15s -> 16902.15s]  Oh, I don't know about that
[16906.62s -> 16909.18s]  Are you kidding me?
[16909.18s -> 16919.34s]  To wipe the whole thing the debt is clear if I win here. Can I call in a wild card?
[16919.42s -> 16922.62s]  Does it have to be germa 985 but can I call in a can I phone a friend here?
[16922.86s -> 16961.69s]  No, it has to be me. This is for all the marvels right here. It's it's me
[16961.77s -> 16976.38s]  It is me go and it has to be this high school arena. No deal. No deal. What do you mean? No deal
[16976.62s -> 16982.33s]  We're gonna have to pull this. Okay. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. We'll pull it
[16982.49s -> 16998.22s]  Remember, this is two catboy streams in a row back to back. So this is so this
[16998.86s -> 17010.52s]  It's just is this deal or no deal. This is if I win the debt is cleared if I lose
[17010.92s -> 17025.51s]  I have to be germa catboy for two days straight. Let's go. Let's see what the people want. Okay
[17026.74s -> 17032.09s]  This is looking pretty unanimous. This is looking pretty unanimous to me
[17039.86s -> 17042.42s]  Either we put an end to the debt arc or we win
[17044.46s -> 17047.50s]  It's true
[17047.50s -> 17049.90s]  2020 we could put a close on it right now or
[17050.54s -> 17053.50s]  It might bleed into 2021 and I have to dress up as a cat person
[17057.53s -> 17069.22s]  Uh, I don't think you guys really lose here. It is set in stone is the deal is the deal
[17069.78s -> 17072.07s]  That's it
[17072.07s -> 17074.23s]  67 of the vote. It's over
[17074.23s -> 17079.35s]  This is either all in this is either two streams in a row. Okay, let's go
[17083.66s -> 17099.22s]  Go go predictions. Oh, I I didn't know we were doing predictions for this one careful on your betting
[17106.57s -> 17108.57s]  Fuck okay right at the bat. Not good
[17108.97s -> 17114.71s]  Let's go get a weapon. Just go it's an extreme rules match go get a knife and just start stabbing catboy
[17115.51s -> 17120.49s]  Just go back there go grab a bag of trash and do the danny devito
[17122.23s -> 17124.23s]  Oh my god, it can't end like this
[17124.71s -> 17127.43s]  Go get a weapon. You can take the health down very quickly
[17127.99s -> 17130.87s]  reversal
[17130.87s -> 17132.87s]  Oh fucking jesus
[17135.27s -> 17138.22s]  Don't even

[17146.12s -> 17151.62s]  You missed a point blank punch
[17151.62s -> 17153.96s]  Don't do a flashy move off the top turnbuckle
[17154.82s -> 17156.42s]  That's not going to do anything
[17156.42s -> 17158.82s]  You're not going to have time to do this. They're going to reverse it
[17162.04s -> 17168.82s]  It's pretty big deal though. That was a big move go get a weapon
[17172.79s -> 17174.79s]  So much riding on this
[17175.19s -> 17179.22s]  This might be the biggest bet of my online career
[17179.78s -> 17185.35s]  What are we doing?
[17185.35s -> 17187.75s]  Yeah, the cat boy's health is not going down
[17187.83s -> 17193.80s]  Um

[17295.80s -> 17300.87s]  The health is pretty comparable. It's not a blowout in either direction
[17303.50s -> 17305.10s]  That's a big move
[17305.10s -> 17314.90s]  Pick up the bat forget about taunting finish it finish it finish it finish this
