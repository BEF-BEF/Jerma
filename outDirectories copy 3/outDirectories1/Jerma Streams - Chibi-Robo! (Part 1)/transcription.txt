[1.27s -> 10.89s]  Hello, hello, hello. Good afternoon. How are you? Good. I'm doing good. I'm doing okay.
[11.53s -> 17.38s]  Got some good news for those of you that were at the stream yesterday into today.
[20.04s -> 30.78s]  Memory card works. I got a uh, got a new one. Chibi-Robo is a go. No corruption,
[30.78s -> 39.94s]  no reformatting necessary. We're good to go. Already tested it. I played through the first
[39.94s -> 46.58s]  part of Chibi-Robo to make sure I could save the... I'm not gonna swear yet. Make sure I could save
[47.38s -> 56.50s]  the darn game and I can. So we're good to go. If you missed the tutorial, uh, just
[57.22s -> 61.30s]  watch the rage-filled first 40 minutes of yesterday's stream and you'll see it.
[62.10s -> 69.34s]  I'll give you a quick rundown. Uh, it's, it's, it's Ribbit Girl's birthday. Happy birthday.
[69.34s -> 76.71s]  And we have to make the family happy. That's it? Did you make the ghost leave? Yeah, I've been
[76.71s -> 84.41s]  burning incense in my room all day. I keep hearing this faint screaming coming from the corners of
[84.41s -> 92.10s]  the room. All right, I got, it says time in here now. Good luck. I got time incense around the whole
[92.10s -> 99.59s]  room. Good luck. Made a couple of phone calls. Bugleberry told me that that was the best thing
[99.59s -> 105.75s]  to do. Sprinkle time in the corners of your room and wear a garlic necklace. And the memory
[105.75s -> 121.13s]  card works. So I, I don't know what to believe anymore. Where's the real German? Show us the
[121.13s -> 127.13s]  necklace. Well, the thing is it was a garlic necklace and I love that stuff. So after a few
[127.13s -> 134.58s]  hours of sitting here waiting and meditating and had a little bit of a snack, I can't help myself.
[138.50s -> 145.48s]  You're a vampire hunter. Yeah, Chibi-Robo, I'm so excited. Now I can actually enjoy the game for
[145.48s -> 161.96s]  what it's supposed to be. That poor garlic. Yeah, I'm ready to go. Here it is. You want to see? Would
[161.96s -> 167.64s]  you guys like to see? Check this out. Ready? Let's plug it in and just make sure that this works.
[168.78s -> 179.22s]  There's the plug. Okay. We have to gain Chibi ranking again. It's okay. 60 more happy points.
[179.30s -> 185.14s]  While you're here, Chibi-Robo, would you like to save? I would love to. And look at that.
[190.23s -> 202.06s]  Now saving. No corrupted memory. I'm so happy. Please reformat. Don't say that shit.
[205.08s -> 215.69s]  Did you slam your memory card into the door? Fuck that thing. I really thought it was going
[215.69s -> 219.93s]  to work yesterday. All right, I'm ready. So the whole goal, I know a lot of you've been waiting
[219.93s -> 224.33s]  for the Sovi. Now the goal is to make everybody happy in the house. You do chores
[226.14s -> 233.67s]  and I'm going to go do them. You pick up trash. You do laundry. It's like my favorite game ever
[233.67s -> 247.46s]  made. All right, let's go. This game is going to make me depressed. What? Why is Chibi-Robo going
[247.46s -> 260.18s]  to make you depressed? He's emulating. Cut the stream. I'm not. Yeah, Dad had a lot of fun at
[260.18s -> 268.52s]  the birthday party. Again, this was a birthday party that we were at. Yeah, sun symbol during
[268.52s -> 273.00s]  the day, moon symbol at night. The moon is out right now. That means it's nighttime, of course.
[274.92s -> 281.78s]  All right, let's get happy points. Time to clean the lid. All right, we did this stuff before,
[281.78s -> 288.98s]  but I'm going to do it again. Offer trash. We're going to throw this stuff in the recycling bin.
[289.94s -> 294.81s]  We're in the trash can. Show the new memory card. Nope, I'm not touching it.
[296.01s -> 302.33s]  I'm going to pour cement into this hole where it's plugged in. This is never coming up ever again.
[306.36s -> 314.38s]  Oh, we saw this yesterday. Dear Diary. Yeah, we were looking at the diary. It's not going to
[314.38s -> 323.45s]  work again. I'm going to put super blue in that hole. Now, but tonight he was lazy and I can watch
[323.45s -> 328.01s]  Drake while he patrols. It's so hard to watch him. That knight in shining armor.
[328.97s -> 339.32s]  Will you poop? I said I'm going to pour cement into the hole.
[345.58s -> 352.04s]  You heard that wrong. Dude, I saw something actually so funny today. This is not a connection
[352.04s -> 357.80s]  to that, but I had to tell this story. So I'm out doing errands and I'm getting shit done.
[358.60s -> 363.56s]  And I pull up and the thing about living in Vegas is this tons of crazy shit that happens
[363.56s -> 367.24s]  all the time in Vegas, right? So there's a big intersection, huge intersection,
[368.04s -> 372.68s]  probably at least a hundred cars on all sides of the intersection. And on the corner
[372.68s -> 376.68s]  of the intersection is a guy in a frog costume dancing around with a sign,
[377.32s -> 382.76s]  which that's not completely out of the ordinary. He's just doing all these crazy moves. He's like
[383.56s -> 389.64s]  lunging forward, lunging forward, spin, spin, spin, point, point at that car, point at that car,
[389.64s -> 393.24s]  point at that car, right? And that's, there's nothing, it's not like, oh, well, that's hilarious
[393.24s -> 401.53s]  or anything, right? But like for 200 feet down from this guy is a bus stop. And the people at
[401.53s -> 410.38s]  this bus stop were fucking furious with this guy. All of them had this face. They were all just so
[410.38s -> 417.19s]  angry. Like, what the fuck is this guy doing? I'm just sitting there going, this is, I mean,
[417.19s -> 421.59s]  yeah, how can you be, can you, can you really be mad at the dancing frog guy? Like, come on.
[422.31s -> 430.39s]  And I'm sitting there thinking, because this is a red light. If people start to go after the frog
[430.39s -> 435.83s]  guy, I gotta get out and I gotta, I would pull over and I'd get out and I would defend the frog
[435.83s -> 440.65s]  guy. You know what I mean? Why would that? I don't know. I don't know why they were so angry with
[443.00s -> 447.24s]  him. He was giving it his all. He was dancing so hard. He was doing so many moves
[447.88s -> 451.40s]  and this whole, I'm talking to all the people at this bus stop. It wasn't just one person.
[451.96s -> 457.05s]  They're all just staring at him with this face, like this. Well, not like that, but like this.
[461.27s -> 465.83s]  Just saying, what the fuck? Are they gonna like fight this guy? Cause he's dancing for like a sail?
[467.32s -> 485.19s]  Star Wars! That's your resting face. I, it was ridiculous. I'm just sitting there going,
[485.19s -> 492.26s]  why is this happening? All right. Let's, we, we, we did this yesterday. We got some big bits too.
[493.06s -> 503.75s]  We just got like $50. Hold on. They all have resting, like mad frog face. I want a free shirt.
[503.75s -> 512.36s]  Is today the last wink day? No, not today. It's coming up soon though. Where's the wink discount?
[512.36s -> 521.96s]  It's not today. It's not today. All right. Passionate love for Drake Redcrest. It's fine.
[522.76s -> 534.78s]  The discount is going to be 67K. That'd be funny. I did fix the memory card issue. We're good to go.
[534.78s -> 538.46s]  We're just trying to get to the point where I was at last night, but yesterday afternoon,
[539.85s -> 546.06s]  just pretty much like right here. After the diary part is when I started to go, guys, you know what?
[546.06s -> 551.02s]  Oh, you know, you know what? No, I can't. I'm going to have to pivot, right? That's,
[551.02s -> 559.40s]  that's kind of when this happened. All right. But we, hold on. We had huge money coming. We
[559.40s -> 565.16s]  have 5,000 bits coming from Bitslave. Thanks for the $50 Bitslave. They say, Hey Jerma,
[565.16s -> 568.04s]  I want to thank you again for taking a couple of days off streaming just to play League of
[568.04s -> 571.88s]  Legends with me. This didn't happen. I had a lot of fun yesterday when we had that whole bottle of
[571.88s -> 575.72s]  Johnny Walker and we were just running it down mid. Thought my account was going to get banned
[575.72s -> 581.64s]  again. Laughing my ass off. Anyways, I can rest easy now that you've played League. No sense denying
[581.64s -> 585.56s]  it now. Chat knows the truth. Just come clean. Also sorry for calling you a boomer the other day.
[586.04s -> 593.37s]  Dude, we got to, we got to get you another game. Can I, can I interest you in a GameCube?
[593.37s -> 611.74s]  All right. You can climb wires here. Dude, I love the GameCube. Thanks for the $50 dude. League was
[611.74s -> 619.74s]  so much fun when we played it last night. I, dude, do you remember when I was twisted fate
[620.46s -> 627.64s]  and I did that fall almost penta? I'm not a jungler typically. So that's why it was hard.
[628.36s -> 638.26s]  We've ran it down mid. Me as the jungle. You as the solo lane. We came and we rescued all. Remember
[638.26s -> 647.54s]  it was, um, oh dude, our team, our team consisted of, God, who was it? It was, uh, Teemo. Me as
[647.54s -> 668.54s]  twisted fate as always. Um, Ewan rise and, um, dual lane was, uh, Vi and Garrett? Garrison? What's
[668.54s -> 676.18s]  the guy with the sword? I forget what his name was. Who's the guy with the sword? Oh no, wait.
[676.18s -> 680.34s]  That's it. That's like a different mobile game that I played. Hold on. What's the mobile game
[680.34s -> 684.18s]  with a guy with the sword is the first character. It's like a mobile MOBA and I downloaded it for
[684.18s -> 690.62s]  free. I played it for 10 minutes. Who was it? No, it's not rage shadow legends. It was another one.
[690.62s -> 694.94s]  It was another, it was a popular one. It was a, no, no, no. What is it? Arena of valor. There it is.
[694.94s -> 705.78s]  Yep. All right. Uh, I'm going to run. Wait, wait, wait. I got to do some stuff. I remember at the
[705.78s -> 712.10s]  last Twitch con or maybe we have, it was a Twitch con. Arena of valor was in the Twitch partner
[712.10s -> 718.90s]  lounge and it was like, Hey, you guys want to play arena of valor? I'm just like, God, no, but,
[718.90s -> 728.38s]  Oh, yeah, sure. Like, dad, that sounds like fun. And I played like one run. How do I climb down?
[730.36s -> 733.16s]  And after, um, and I know they were going to come over and ask me all these questions.
[734.12s -> 738.62s]  We played one round and it was like, dude, Hey, that's just, you'd finished.
[738.62s -> 751.48s]  How was it? What do you think? Oh, it's fine. It was fun. Oh, all right. It's okay. My spine is intact.
[752.76s -> 773.51s]  And what do you say? I think I played, I played smite, but no. Are you going to save? Yes, of
[773.51s -> 786.09s]  course I am. But yeah. And then I wanted to like avoid the tables where they were. I'm fucking weird
[786.09s -> 789.77s]  guys. Like I didn't want to like go back over to the tables because I was like, I was one of the
[789.77s -> 796.06s]  people that played the game and it was just, if I sit over at those tables against me like, Hey,
[796.06s -> 804.66s]  you're back. How about another fucking round? Yeah. No, thank you. Yeah. I guess I'm just here for a
[804.66s -> 812.78s]  water. I just came in here to get a water, but I mean, it's all right. It's a cool games. All right.
[812.78s -> 824.87s]  Yeah. Just wait till we throw this shit in the trash. Always pick up the plug because you run
[824.87s -> 827.83s]  faster. That's a tip I got yesterday. Even without any, I haven't even started the game yet.
[828.79s -> 841.54s]  That's why, I mean, you might think I'm weird, but going to like Twitch con and stuff,
[842.66s -> 846.50s]  I almost want to put on like a disguise, like a mustache, a hat and like sunglasses.
[847.30s -> 856.06s]  Cause it's like somebody, if somebody ever comes over and like a partner lounge is like, Hey,
[856.06s -> 863.30s]  Oh, what are your channels? I don't have, I got the mustache. I don't have one. Oh, okay.
[864.28s -> 872.38s]  See you guys around. You have to do an incognito cosplay like Savage does.
[883.59s -> 894.17s]  No, I'm talking about just like a mustache. That might be a good idea. I don't know.
[894.81s -> 905.46s]  Maybe I would do it one day. Oh, there's a coin in here. Nice. Just put on like fake eyebrows and
[905.46s -> 914.71s]  shit of a glue on big bushy mustache and like a fake chin strap or something and just walk around
[914.71s -> 918.71s]  and just, and if anyone comes up to me and asks me what channel is, I just say, I don't have one.
[920.58s -> 925.38s]  Hey, can I, can I interest you in playing some arena valor? Wait, wait, wait, who are you?
[925.38s -> 930.26s]  Don't have a name tag on you. Who are you? I don't, I just walk around with my mustache.
[930.26s -> 933.70s]  Oh, and I don't give a shit. I don't fucking care about you. Any, any partners over here?
[934.34s -> 948.44s]  Be so much easier. Can I get in here? Come on. I can get that. All right. It's time to go to bed.
[949.93s -> 957.29s]  Oh, there's so many coins. All right. I have to turn the TV on and wake up dad, right?
[958.01s -> 964.34s]  Don't forget the chibi coffee. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I do have that.
[964.90s -> 966.58s]  I'm just so happy that I actually get to play the game.
[970.01s -> 981.98s]  Hannah Montana. No, but Hannah Montana just had a different color hair. That was it.
[983.24s -> 988.44s]  If I walked into Twitch con with just like orange hair, I'm still, I'm Jeremy. Like that
[988.44s -> 1001.72s]  doesn't change anything. It was two different people. No. Okay. If Miley Cyrus had a must,
[1001.72s -> 1009.64s]  if, okay, Miley Cyrus is Hannah Montana. She put on like a wig and like a mustache and like sunglasses
[1009.64s -> 1023.66s]  and that was Hannah Montana. It might be, you could hide. Spoiler alert. You don't, please.
[1024.62s -> 1035.19s]  Why do you know so much about Hannah Montana? But that I know that Hannah Montana is Miley Cyrus,
[1035.19s -> 1042.25s]  the actress that plays Hannah Montana. Oh, is that so? That's not a whole lot of information.
[1046.20s -> 1051.54s]  I need, I need to get some real happy points here. You bet your ass I want to say.
[1057.51s -> 1061.11s]  Is it banned? That show's not even, it's been off the air for 10 years. What are you talking about?
[1062.55s -> 1077.14s]  Well, I thought we were going to bed. Oh, I just got up.
[1077.46s -> 1089.21s]  All right, fine. I thought I could go to bed. I thought saving did it. So did you watch it? No,
[1089.21s -> 1097.29s]  I didn't. I, yes. Okay. I have watched Hannah Montana in the same way that you've watched
[1097.29s -> 1105.69s]  Hannah Montana. When you go from Fox Sports to the Disney channel, to Cartoon Network. So I've seen
[1106.41s -> 1112.84s]  12 seconds of Hannah Montana, maybe like four or five episodes worth. So
[1115.88s -> 1122.71s]  we've all seen it. Can you make the noise this thing is making? Yeah, probably.
[1125.74s -> 1137.64s]  That's pretty close. Yeah, I can turn into a super frog.
[1141.13s -> 1147.51s]  Who owns the super frog license? And can they become in contact? I have some consulting I
[1147.51s -> 1150.15s]  could do. I got some consultant work I could do for that new game, bringing it back.
[1152.38s -> 1155.82s]  All right. Oh, yes. Of course. Every time it tells me to, I'm going to save every time.
[1165.32s -> 1172.09s]  All right, let's go. I don't think anyone owns super frog. Somebody does. All right, let's get
[1172.09s -> 1192.09s]  going. Coins. Happy point. Give me that. Give me that frog binky, whatever it is.
[1193.05s -> 1204.55s]  Wait, does the music change how fast you walk? That's insane. Really? Bring. All right. Yeah,
[1204.55s -> 1220.76s]  whatever it is. Frog ring. It does. You're always on beat no matter what in Chibi-Robo.
[1220.76s -> 1225.83s]  That's crazy. All right, let's go get some happy points here. We have to
[1225.83s -> 1243.48s]  make a Ribbit girl laugh or something, right? Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit. Yep. Climb on
[1243.48s -> 1259.22s]  my hand. Climb, ribbit. Oh, I didn't even realize that. Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit. Make the same joke.
[1259.22s -> 1284.04s]  No, I can't do that. Drop it. Clean up. I need to pick up all the trash. What does Dad want for
[1284.04s -> 1293.45s]  happiness? We got to go faster. Dad, what does Dad want? Hey there, Chibi-Robo. How goes it?
[1293.45s -> 1299.45s]  You're getting used to our hubs? My wife sheep mad at me. Sheep, but I don't worry. Sheep about it.
[1300.49s -> 1312.22s]  Just go get a load of happy points, okay? What do I put up here? Is there still
[1312.38s -> 1322.49s]  some trash right there? I got seconds on me at time. Am I going to Pax? I am not going to Pax.
[1323.37s -> 1340.12s]  I will not be at Pax East. I ain't going anywhere. If I do go, I'm going with a Mustat. Three happy
[1340.12s -> 1347.45s]  points. Six happy points. All right, I have enough happy points to upgrade the character.
[1351.22s -> 1359.96s]  You got 120 bucks too. Nice. All right. What else is up here? It'll be there in disguise.
[1362.81s -> 1370.36s]  Can I open the door? Chibi-Robo? Oh, it's just a sticker that someone put over the cracked window.
[1371.40s -> 1374.68s]  If you shoot that with the Chibi Blaster, I bet you can go outside.
[1375.48s -> 1382.15s]  Breaking windows won't make Mrs. Sanderson happy at all. Can I just say, can we just ask her to
[1382.15s -> 1390.20s]  slide the door open? Can I climb this? All right, I got to use the Chibi Copter. Oh wait, there's
[1390.20s -> 1398.44s]  Cheetos under here. How much does it cost to get a birthday shout out from Bugleberry?
[1401.08s -> 1410.66s]  How much does it cost? It costs absolutely nothing. Oh, I heard it was somebody's birthday.
[1411.70s -> 1418.42s]  Someone, someone told me there was a terrifying birthday party. I wish I was invited, but happy
[1418.42s -> 1425.37s]  birthday to you and to all the people at your birthday party. I'll be here in Jeremy's room
[1425.37s -> 1446.25s]  warning off the ghosts and ghouls. Goodbye. Get out, get out. Do I have that on a hot key?
[1447.29s -> 1455.14s]  But let's charge. I'm losing viewers. I'm losing viewers.
[1459.74s -> 1476.42s]  Oh, it feels so good just to be able to go like this. Oh, that probably hurt. All right,
[1476.42s -> 1493.08s]  what's left? Let's go up. I'm going to climb the chair. Wait, there's trash. Up on the chair
[1494.04s -> 1503.82s]  there's tons of trash over here too. Oh yeah, I love picking up trash. Nice. This game is like
[1503.82s -> 1509.50s]  exactly what I'm looking for. How do I get up there? All right. Well, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1509.50s -> 1525.29s]  wait. I can, can I jump on this? Oh yeah. Oh yes, I can. So why can I hold on? Oh, I need to pull
[1525.29s -> 1537.18s]  this. Push it right up against the wall here. I want to, I can get these bolts and up. Yeah.
[1537.34s -> 1553.34s]  Nice. It's $50. How much, I'm almost out of time. All right. Then I'm going to fly over
[1553.34s -> 1564.02s]  to this here. Let's pick up the trash. I love this game already. I love this game. It's so,
[1565.38s -> 1578.89s]  it's exactly what I'm looking for every time. Oh, I'm almost out of battery. It's just about
[1578.89s -> 1582.89s]  picking up trash and it's so, it's, there's no stress here.
[1585.29s -> 1595.19s]  Space hunter Drake Redcrest is on soon. Can't wait. Woo. It's on TV. This is a fake news
[1595.19s -> 1602.07s]  emergency alert. Huh? This just didn't. Chibi Robo's everywhere are coming under attack
[1603.99s -> 1612.74s]  and the perpetrators appear to be the spy doors. Where do they come from?
[1612.74s -> 1617.78s]  Why do they attack? We don't know. I thought it was going to be, perhaps they hate Chibi Robo's
[1617.78s -> 1626.90s]  winning smile. Viewers ask yourself, is your Chibi Robo safe or is it in mortal danger?
[1629.26s -> 1636.22s]  This is Ron Brokejaw reporting for Faux News. Is it Fox News or Faux News?
[1637.10s -> 1641.46s]  Now let's go to Sunny Merriweather with tomorrow's forecast, Sunny.
[1644.34s -> 1650.26s]  Thanks, Ron. You're going to life by forecast. Tomorrow will be sunny, rainy or uphilly.
[1652.58s -> 1659.42s]  Same energy. No, that's all wrong. The spiders are the Chibi Robo's friends. They are,
[1659.42s -> 1665.98s]  at least they should be. Ah, frosting. Listen, Chibi Robo, you need to be careful. Those
[1665.98s -> 1671.34s]  spiders are dangerous right now. If something were to happen to you, I'd be really sad. Got it?
[1672.22s -> 1676.97s]  Why don't you fucking put some like anti-spider defense system in the house?
[1678.01s -> 1684.10s]  Oh, we just had five community subs just coming. Just some normal guy 25. Thanks for the five
[1684.10s -> 1690.97s]  community subs. I gotta, no, no, no, no, I'm trying to pick up the, I hope you make it a number one
[1690.97s -> 1696.89s]  in the Chibi Robo ranking. Oh, by the way, the room looks really clean today. You must have
[1696.89s -> 1715.10s]  worked so hard. Yup. 10 happy points from dad for cleaning up his mess. All right, cool. Now I need,
[1716.46s -> 1719.77s]  I don't think I can make that. All right, I gotta go. Let's go plug in.
[1723.48s -> 1730.42s]  Fuck. What happens if I go to zero? Um, I need an outlet right now. Outlet right now. Where's an
[1730.42s -> 1735.30s]  outlet? Right now. I need an outlet right now. What about, I'm going to die. What happens if
[1735.30s -> 1749.08s]  Chibi Robo dies? It's okay. We got saved by the bell. Chibi Robo, time sure flies when you're
[1749.08s -> 1753.80s]  making folks happy. Oh, the day has ended. Let's return to the Chibi house. Plug in.
[1760.41s -> 1766.25s]  I got 60 happy points though. Great work out there. Let's adjust your happy point total.
[1767.69s -> 1778.26s]  Your Chibi ranking has gone from 591,000 to 192,000. So these are, I'm against other Chibi Robos.
[1780.66s -> 1789.58s]  What are these other 300,000 Chibi Robos doing? 400,000 of them. I picked up like five pieces of
[1789.58s -> 1800.20s]  trash. Battle Royale. They're dying to spiders. In order to get the next bonus battery, you need
[1800.20s -> 1805.94s]  eight more happy points. You're ever going to become super Chibi Robo. You need some advice,
[1805.94s -> 1811.53s]  namely mine. Use Y to activate your Chibi vision and scan your surroundings for items.
[1812.49s -> 1817.45s]  Use R to open up a map of the room and find yourself a nearby outlet. Oh, that's good to know.
[1819.45s -> 1822.57s]  To celebrate opening my advice booth, I'm handing up free advice.
[1826.39s -> 1832.97s]  I would love to save. Going up the rankings.
[1835.29s -> 1839.75s]  All right. Now, can I do anything? What can I do with the Chibi computer?
[1839.75s -> 1849.51s]  My online shop. Timer 10, timer 15. What do these do? 10 minutes for half a day
[1849.51s -> 1857.50s]  for a leisurely pace. Come on. Timer 15. 15 minutes for half a day for a truly leisurely pace.
[1859.19s -> 1867.88s]  So what? Is this just better? Timer 15. Oh, it's a timer. I get it. So I just get more time.
[1868.84s -> 1872.84s]  Pink flower seed. Pink flower will grow from this seed.
[1875.16s -> 1882.65s]  Nectar. Chibi blasters. 1100 bucks. I get 15 minutes. Yeah, that's better. I get these seeds.
[1883.53s -> 1893.61s]  All right. Pink flower seed. Blue flower seed. And white flower seed. Okay. What about recycle
[1893.61s -> 1923.27s]  atron? I have to plant these? Timer 15. Chibi Robo and Smash Brothers. Yes. No, not yet. He's
[1923.27s -> 1947.34s]  a spirit. He's a costume. Oh, yeah. He was a me costume. He should be a real character, Pepe
[1947.34s -> 1961.29s]  Handsome. All right. What about Drake on the TV? Drake on TV, right? Here's the map. Backyard.
[1961.29s -> 1967.77s]  We got plugs. C is zoom. Oh, that's cool. We got plugs everywhere. Okay. I'm going to turn the TV
[1967.77s -> 1990.50s]  on and then go read the diary. What does this do? What's going on? A little toothbrush? What's that?
[1991.14s -> 2002.07s]  Is this a toothbrush? Hey, look at that. It's Mr. Sanderson's toothbrush, but let's take it anyway.
[2002.07s -> 2007.27s]  I bet he won't miss it. Now that we have this nifty device, but you can clean all sorts of stains.
[2008.31s -> 2017.85s]  Oh, yes. Press X to open the equivalent menu. Like the toothbrush with and use A to hold it.
[2018.81s -> 2025.86s]  You want to put the toothbrush away. Press B. There's a stain right there. Why don't you give
[2025.86s -> 2043.90s]  it a good scrub? Yes. Oh, yes. I'm so happy. I can clean surfaces. Look at all these stains.
[2043.98s -> 2056.92s]  Over here. I don't even get this dog stain. It's odd if the TV just turned on all by itself.
[2057.56s -> 2072.42s]  All right. Well, let's go. Can I turn it off? Open the drawer. Chibi. What's the proper way
[2072.42s -> 2092.65s]  to address Chibi Robo? CR? Chibi? Chibi Robo is too long. Chibs? Robo? Look at that stain right
[2092.65s -> 2102.20s]  there. How do I put the stain on the wall? There's a stain right there. How do I get that stain?
[2102.20s -> 2117.43s]  I can't. How do I do this? Oh, fuck. I'm out of battery. How do I use first person again?
[2120.84s -> 2139.00s]  Where's the TV? TV's like up here. Hold on. I got another coin over here. Another coin this way.
[2139.00s -> 2145.77s]  All right. There's a plug. I got a plug. I got to get up to the TV.
[2147.77s -> 2166.95s]  Chibi, you're dying. All right. Would you guys take Amazon instant delivery? Like when you clicked
[2166.95s -> 2173.91s]  buy, you got it. The technology, like we're at like 10G. Technology with just instantly a drone.
[2173.91s -> 2179.74s]  Got it in front of your door when you press buy, right? But this is the noise you hear in your house
[2179.74s -> 2207.58s]  24x7. No. That would also be bad. Okay. TV. All right. There's the TV. Don't look at it.
[2208.60s -> 2222.97s]  Don't look at it, Chibi Robo. Get away from it. What the hell is that? So confused. So conflicted.
[2224.33s -> 2231.83s]  People say evil. People say justice. But what is justice? And what is evil? Do I truly fight
[2231.83s -> 2239.93s]  on the side of justice? Or am I just a fool, a blind fool? No, I fight on the side of justice.
[2241.42s -> 2244.78s]  Those who think they can disturb the peace will get a taste of my space fury.
[2247.37s -> 2263.22s]  It's I, Super Frog Falcon, space hunter Drake Redcrest. What are you doing here?
[2264.02s -> 2280.22s]  Drake Redcrest, you're you're still as sharp as ever. Hi, space hunter Redcrest. Good morning,
[2280.22s -> 2289.61s]  Chibi Robo. What's this? No answer, eh? Space Hunter Code Part One. Greet everyone by yelling.
[2289.61s -> 2297.13s]  Perhaps you have been shocked into silence by the sight of toys moving. Do not be afraid,
[2297.13s -> 2299.77s]  friend. The toys in this house move and speak when humans aren't around.
[2300.81s -> 2304.89s]  Enough talk. It bores Drake Redcrest. Let us be friends, oh diminutive one.
[2305.85s -> 2310.54s]  As a friend, it is my duty to inform you that your life appears to need more justice.
[2312.14s -> 2320.14s]  Drake Redcrest can solve that problem. Take this special gift. It's just for you.
[2324.63s -> 2336.25s]  What's in it? Drake Redcrest suit. Um, yep. Have I show you how to don it, friend? Yes, how do I
[2336.33s -> 2341.61s]  put this on? Immediately. Your honesty is noble and must be rewarded, therefore Drake Redcrest
[2341.61s -> 2350.04s]  shall teach you. Next, open the equipment menu. If the chibi gear on the top bar is selected,
[2351.48s -> 2357.72s]  simply tilt down, I say. Two weeks it will let you access your suits. Is that to select
[2357.72s -> 2365.24s]  the suit you wanted by person left or right? Oh, what? You can put on costumes?
[2365.24s -> 2373.18s]  You are a smart one. Ha ha, we shall meet again. But for now, we ride. If you are ever interested
[2373.18s -> 2378.30s]  in achieving justice, wear that and speak to me. We shall learn the facts of justice together.
[2379.26s -> 2389.42s]  I'm just along for the ride. I'm the baby that gets brought to the convention.
[2391.67s -> 2400.78s]  Dad's in Superman costume. Mom is superwoman. And I'm also dressed as Superman and with a helmet on
[2400.78s -> 2408.66s]  and stuff. Take me around to the convention floor. Everyone will be so excited to see me.
[2409.38s -> 2420.63s]  The way I talk to him again. Space Hunter Drake Redcrest. Okay, so I talk to you again if I want
[2420.63s -> 2427.59s]  to do justice. Looks good on you, little man. So you wish to fight for truth and justice, eh? Don't
[2427.59s -> 2440.87s]  lie. I know these things. Yes. That's a specialty of mine. You just sit back and enjoy the ride.
[2441.59s -> 2452.90s]  All right, let's go to the convention. Hold, stand your ground. Very well, my small metal friend.
[2454.10s -> 2462.01s]  I will now administer the test of justice. It'll be long, hard, and a word I don't know.
[2462.01s -> 2468.65s]  But you must endure no matter the cost. Ready? Then we ride. Mark my word, mark my wealth.
[2469.37s -> 2480.33s]  Space Hunter Code Part 2. True justice cannot exist without a pose. You'll never be an agent
[2480.33s -> 2487.35s]  of justice unless you master this. Old friend, you must be the one known as television.
[2489.18s -> 2502.63s]  Oh, how did you know my name? You laugh a lot. Ha ha ha. I could scream, but I don't want to.
[2502.63s -> 2511.50s]  That's justice 101, my flying metal friend. Wow, that's impressive. We're about to enter
[2511.50s -> 2520.01s]  dangerous skies here. You must fly back. Are you ready? Here's the skinny. When I start to pose,
[2520.01s -> 2529.77s]  press Z immediately. Easy as pie, right? Sure. Press Z immediately when he starts posing.
[2531.03s -> 2542.17s]  You can do it, Chibi-Robo. Okay, here we go. I did it. Too slow. Curses and blasts. Try it again.
[2542.89s -> 2561.06s]  Space Hunter Drake Red Crest. I learned the pose. That's fantastic. You're the best, Chibi-Robo.
[2563.40s -> 2572.01s]  Ah, stupendously done, Chibi-Robo. I mean, Space Hunter Robo. I am now proud to appoint you as the
[2572.01s -> 2580.34s]  universe's 99th space hunter. Climb the rankings and assassinate the other 98 space hunters to
[2580.34s -> 2593.85s]  reach number one assassin. Oh, I got 19 happy points for that and 100 bucks. Spread the happiness.
[2597.11s -> 2601.67s]  You mastered Drake Red Crest Z action. Show everyone what you can do with it.
[2602.31s -> 2608.31s]  I just have a pose in front of people. Think of justice when you wear this. You're around, Hunter.
[2612.90s -> 2623.56s]  Wait, what? Oh, I'm just showing it to him. Space Hunter Drake Red Crest. Hello, Space Hunter Robo.
[2624.28s -> 2628.92s]  Your excitement is indeed impressive, but it seems that the living room is currently in a state of
[2629.56s -> 2637.10s]  broccoli-ism. That is a word, right? Of course it is. Irregardlessness,
[2637.10s -> 2641.18s]  I shall lead you in charge of tomorrow's patrol, Space Hunter Chibi-Robo.
[2642.06s -> 2649.98s]  Let's clean up. Wait, doesn't... All right, the person over here with the diary. Should I do the
[2649.98s -> 2655.42s]  pose? I'm going to freak this person out. They're going to think, look, this is a reverse disguise.
[2657.30s -> 2676.10s]  Ready? Who it is? Hey, what do you think about this? Oh, my. What's that sound? That's handsome
[2676.10s -> 2686.23s]  sound. Drake Red Crest. Oh, my gosh. You patrol really good. Sophie, no, that was so stupid.
[2686.23s -> 2704.34s]  What's up with her? What the fuck is going on over here in chat?
[2704.34s -> 2714.36s]  Put it in sub-only. Put it in sub-only. We got to... Come on. What is this horse shit? Sub-only. Let's go.
[2720.22s -> 2721.34s]  Let's get it in sub-only.
[2725.40s -> 2729.08s]  We good? We good. Okay. What the fuck?
[2735.98s -> 2739.62s]  All right, it's... We're back. All right, now we can go into the kitchen.
[2740.34s -> 2755.94s]  But no, we can't. I got to plug in first. Imagine eating ass. Imagine.
[2760.22s -> 2762.30s]  You're fully recharged. Now, yes, I'd love to save.
[2766.47s -> 2768.79s]  How many costumes are there in the game? I feel like this should be a lot.
[2769.51s -> 2788.01s]  I need to collect at least four of them. I want to be free. Don't worry, you will be soon.
[2791.94s -> 2797.00s]  In fact... All right, you know what? Put it in follow-only mode instead.
[2797.96s -> 2801.56s]  But follow-only... You got to be followed the channel for at least what? Like 30 minutes,
[2801.56s -> 2810.52s]  something like that. Follow-only. Let's see if that works. It's always in follow-only, but...
[2811.64s -> 2818.55s]  Length of time, though. One day follow-only, maybe? One year follow-only. I don't know about
[2818.55s -> 2838.17s]  that one. No, I got to clean. Hold on. You can't even do that. I like cleaning with a toothbrush.
[2838.73s -> 2841.82s]  Remember, you're almost at 10 million views. What do I have right now?
[2842.78s -> 2849.08s]  TV Robo, all of your hard work has made Mrs. Sanderson happy, happy, happy.
[2850.68s -> 2853.64s]  You see, she's given me a bunch of bonus happy points in Moolah.
[2856.55s -> 2859.43s]  And when you clean enough, I can give you a nice little cleaning bonus.
[2859.43s -> 2863.75s]  MonkaS, what's he doing? Your happy point bonus is...
[2864.95s -> 2873.53s]  8 happy points. That doesn't seem like very much. 10 million... What am I? 9,995,000 views? Holy shit.
[2876.79s -> 2891.43s]  9,995,000. Well, come on, guys. Tell your friends. Spread the infection. Lick the germs.
[2892.62s -> 2896.38s]  Tell everybody that you know to check out this stream. Get us over 10 million.
[2898.76s -> 2906.65s]  Pog, we're doing it today. We're doing it today. Am I doing it right? How do I clean stuff on the
[2906.65s -> 2914.09s]  walls? Fuck, I'm almost out of battery. Come here. I got a lot of... Wait, there's a plug right here,
[2914.09s -> 2929.67s]  right? Oh, fuck. There's no plug here. What does the 10 millionth viewer get?
[2933.29s -> 2943.21s]  There's no way to tell. There's no way to tell who is the 10 million viewer. This isn't a radio station.
[2955.35s -> 2961.42s]  Breambin, thanks for five community subs, Breambin. Appreciate it. Thanks for the five subs.
[2961.42s -> 2967.46s]  Community subs. I want to get that frog coin in there. Yeah, I'm going to call it frog coins
[2967.46s -> 2974.41s]  because I love Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars. I want to get up there. There's so
[2974.41s -> 2986.10s]  much to do. All right. Let's trash, trash. Throw the trash away. Play Bowser's Inside Story. LOL.
[2986.82s -> 2991.94s]  That's as good as Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars. It probably isn't. No, it probably
[2991.94s -> 2996.18s]  isn't, but it's still probably just as good. It's my favorite game I ever made, but it's
[2996.18s -> 3006.66s]  going to be hard to top it. Five community subs from Jamie. Thank you, Jamie. Thanks a lot for the
[3006.66s -> 3015.29s]  sub. Oh, what's the candy wrapper? Five points. I got a lot of money.
[3020.79s -> 3026.52s]  10 millionth viewer gets a dork cube, but there's no way to tell who the 10 million viewer is.
[3027.64s -> 3040.09s]  You can't. There's no way for me to tell. All right, I want to get up there.
[3044.60s -> 3051.03s]  I can plug into this guy and give this guy power. All Sub-Aleem mode does is just give
[3051.03s -> 3062.46s]  plebs extra space for sub points. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I gotta
[3062.46s -> 3073.77s]  make that more money. I have to make that more money. What do I do? Charge him? Oh, is this a
[3073.77s -> 3084.55s]  small door? That's odd. I have no info on it in my memory bank. What's in here? What the fuck? Look
[3084.55s -> 3094.20s]  at all this money. Whoa. There's a little secret, uh, charging power money station.
[3097.27s -> 3105.11s]  Imagine paying five dollars a month to type poop dick. Um, that you don't think that's worth it.
[3109.78s -> 3114.26s]  Dum dee dum dee dum. Hey, since this small door has your eyes, let's call it a chibi door.
[3114.82s -> 3132.95s]  Guys, I got a lot of money. It's so, it's so simple. If I say one thing, you guys, it's so
[3132.95s -> 3144.12s]  simple. Everyone just starts saying it. Okay. We didn't do an experiment. I'm going to say
[3144.12s -> 3162.41s]  something and you're going to repeat it. Okay. Celery. Celery. I love celery. Celery. Interesting.
[3162.41s -> 3179.64s]  Interesting. Sailboat. I was in a sailboat one day and I love sailboat. Sailboat. Sailboat.
[3179.64s -> 3201.37s]  Sailboat. Cleaning bonus. Nice. Okay. Let's now subscribe. Subscribe.
[3203.91s -> 3206.23s]  Subscription. Subscription service.
[3212.87s -> 3221.80s]  Nice. Okay. You do. All right. You guys are good. Yep. I saw scam like 10,000 times.
[3222.60s -> 3230.79s]  All right. I got, you guys, you guys can resist. Sell out. Selling out.
[3231.19s -> 3253.85s]  Sell out. Best stream. Stream I'm on currently. That is the best stream. Best stream. And don't
[3253.85s -> 3271.34s]  stop saying it. Best stream. You fuckers. I didn't see once my name. I didn't see one time.
[3272.38s -> 3285.90s]  Really? Not even once? Let's try another one. Poopoo. I want to have that one. Poopoo.
[3286.06s -> 3307.42s]  Poopoo. I wanted people to write that one. You guys are fucked. He's an egomaniac.
[3312.52s -> 3328.92s]  Well, in this industry you gotta be. Can I climb this? Can I? Maybe I can float.
[3328.92s -> 3338.46s]  This is exactly why I don't like Twitch. Wait. What? I can float over here.
[3342.97s -> 3355.21s]  Got it. Yes. Can I climb here? Oh, we can go up the whole thing. Play better. What? I just did
[3355.21s -> 3360.73s]  something good. Now I can float from here. Is there another coin up here? Oh, I can turn the
[3360.73s -> 3370.73s]  light off. All right. Turn the light off. Oh no. I can go up. Derma lied about the frog coin. Thanks
[3370.73s -> 3381.03s]  for the what? Thanks for the subs. What do you do? What? What does that even mean? All right. We're
[3381.03s -> 3385.99s]  up here. Ooh. There's another chibi door. All right. Put this shit away. Come here. Is there a plug?
[3386.47s -> 3400.18s]  Oh. I almost died. Look at all this. Okay. Wait. Let's charge up. Wait. This is going to take a
[3400.18s -> 3411.85s]  lot of energy. How much is it going to take? It's okay. There's money in here. It's a lot of money.
[3413.37s -> 3418.55s]  All right. I can't clean anything up here yet. Should I knock this off? I'm going to knock this
[3418.55s -> 3449.66s]  off. Push it off. Right? Should I push this off? There's probably something in here. It went too
[3449.66s -> 3458.90s]  far. What's it doing? It's a funeral? Oh, chibi robo. Look at the state you're in. I thought maybe
[3458.90s -> 3476.66s]  we could make it to the top of the chibi ranking together. Is that it? Oh, I can move. Oh, you're
[3476.66s -> 3483.86s]  alive. I was worried sick. Remember, you're a robot. If your energy ever drops to zero, you'll
[3483.86s -> 3488.42s]  switch off just like that. Watch your charge and use an outlet if you have to recharge.
[3489.38s -> 3492.42s]  Oh, and you should know, if you ever pass out like that again, don't get too worried.
[3493.30s -> 3497.94s]  Your faithful friend, Television, that's me, will carry you back to the chibi house.
[3499.86s -> 3505.86s]  Oh, another thing. If you press X and select remove, you'll change out of your trauma suit.
[3507.86s -> 3514.34s]  Oh, it looks like you lost some moolah. What? Don't look at me. Oh no, you lose money.
[3514.34s -> 3521.46s]  If you're a robo, you can buy chibi batteries from the online shop now. They'll come in handy,
[3521.46s -> 3527.62s]  I think. If you get one of these, you can recover just enough energy to go in and recharge yourself.
[3530.89s -> 3535.61s]  Pick one up and try it out. I'm definitely upgraded.
[3539.66s -> 3548.90s]  I'm in the top 25,000. We're making it into the top 100,000. Citrus Soft has sent you a
[3548.90s -> 3555.56s]  special gift, a brand new bonus battery. Would you look at that? Your battery power went up 100.
[3559.08s -> 3568.57s]  Oh, nice. I need 21 more happy points. All right, they wanted me to buy something.
[3570.33s -> 3584.92s]  I'm sure we can save. From Soft? All right, take it off. Stop bowling. All right, get it off. Stop
[3584.92s -> 3596.81s]  bowling. Okay, chibi battery. All right, I can buy the blaster or a battery. Can I get a battery?
[3599.27s -> 3606.73s]  Why were we on sub only? Because there was some fucking plots.
[3608.04s -> 3613.34s]  Trying to eat that, you know what I mean? All right, so here we go. Blaster,
[3615.26s -> 3618.54s]  chibi blaster. It allows you to fire sonic blasts. Got it.
[3618.54s -> 3624.50s]  I don't have any more money.
[3630.68s -> 3643.29s]  Thank you for your visit. So now I have a gun. Okay, put it down, put it down, put it down,
[3643.29s -> 3649.66s]  put it down. Aim that at me, you stupid. You've upgraded. Keep it up, chibi robo. Let's go.
[3650.54s -> 3686.97s]  Freedom, freedom. Sub only forever. Did I take it off? There we go. Okay, welcome back. All right,
[3686.97s -> 3701.26s]  I want to do, I want to get back up there. Released from pleb storage.
[3704.76s -> 3719.54s]  Pleb storage. All right, that's funny. Press Z? What just happened? I just took like 400 damage.
[3719.54s -> 3734.39s]  I don't have any trash. Why would you, what's the point of that? Oh, excuse me.
[3736.47s -> 3745.37s]  All right, let's put a hole in the door, right? We can go chibi blaster. Okay, and fire.
[3751.24s -> 3764.60s]  Why am I hurt? Because I fell off the top of the building, whatever it was.
[3764.60s -> 3773.05s]  Yikes. Didn't do it. Wasn't me. Don't deactivate me. We're in the backyard. They've welcomed you
[3773.05s -> 3783.27s]  into their home. It's so cute. I love it. Oh, you can do first person. Oh, wow.
[3785.93s -> 3793.61s]  Okay, don't. It's Donald Duck? All right, plug this in. Put this away.
[3798.89s -> 3814.52s]  All right, I need an outlet back here. I love these little chibi doors.
[3815.96s -> 3830.17s]  Is there outlets outside? Probably not. There's so many things to do. I have so many jobs to do.
[3830.17s -> 3841.42s]  I need outlet. How would they be outlet outside? I know, I know, I know. I'll get in a second.
[3841.42s -> 3859.30s]  I have to leave. 27 stains. Happy point bonuses. 14. I have outdoor outlets. Yeah, you can have
[3859.30s -> 3864.73s]  outdoor. That's not out of the ordinary. Your very presence makes everyone happy.
[3866.17s -> 3872.31s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. Pick up this. Let's go. Plug in. I need an outlet. I need an
[3872.31s -> 3886.20s]  outlet. Outlet. Outlet. Outlet. The nearest outlet is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3886.92s -> 3897.93s]  Okay, there's one over here. I almost pressed Z. I almost just hit my head on the ground.
[3898.49s -> 3904.26s]  Well, it's almost time to go home anyways. All right, here's an outlet. Wait, was that lied to?
[3904.50s -> 3916.09s]  An outlet right here? What was that lied to? Where is it? Where is it?
[3925.56s -> 3937.56s]  Is it up? Where is it? Oh, fuck. It's up there, huh? Uh-oh. What do you mean blind? Behind what?
[3938.28s -> 3954.74s]  Behind this? No, that's up. What do you mean blind? It's apparently up here. Is it behind this?
[3954.74s -> 3974.54s]  Um, Chibi-Robo, did you just hear that totally weird sound? Yes, I did.
[3977.74s -> 3981.98s]  I heard a strange noise coming from the far side of the foyer. I'm scared.
[3986.12s -> 3999.40s]  Wait, there's... Okay, there is one behind here. There's one right here. It's dead.
[4001.86s -> 4016.12s]  It's a fart. I'll never get over that, will I? Okay, let's go.
[4019.91s -> 4025.11s]  All right, so there's one back there. Did I pick up any? I didn't pick up any trash.
[4025.11s -> 4034.78s]  Almost time to go to bed. The coin? Here's a list of your nominees. Can we remove that?
[4037.08s -> 4042.12s]  Oh, I gotta cancel SurveyMonkey. All right. Yeah, what has it been? Like three months? All right.
[4044.17s -> 4063.88s]  All right. Yeah. Oh, trash. Get behind this? No. All right, we're about to go to bed. I should have.
[4063.88s -> 4072.25s]  I think I upgraded. Fringe streamer won't use SurveyMonkey. What the hell do you want me to use
[4072.25s -> 4084.14s]  it for right now? It's coming from the foyer again. Yeah, well, I don't have time to investigate. It's
[4084.14s -> 4098.71s]  time for bed. Fringe. He said it, guys. It's a stupid word. I can say it. All right. What's
[4098.71s -> 4105.75s]  left in here? Can I go back up? I want to go up here. You know what I mean? I want to go up there.
[4106.47s -> 4114.22s]  I gotta climb up the thing, the lamp, like I did before, and then I have to fly over here. That's
[4114.22s -> 4134.44s]  what I'm doing tomorrow. Blaster cleans wall stains. Really? All right. I got a lot of happy points.
[4135.88s -> 4154.28s]  Good morning. Let's adjust your happy points. New ranking. Top 1000. Top 10,000.
[4157.56s -> 4167.18s]  I'm going to wait for a battery now. 120 battery points. Those other cheapy robos
[4167.18s -> 4174.23s]  are just paperweights. I am the number one. I need 200. Okay, this is where the game really
[4174.23s -> 4184.55s]  opens up here. Cross small gaps. Use the cheapy copter. Really, all you have to do is press A.
[4184.55s -> 4192.82s]  That makes you fly horizontal for a little while. Thank you. And we have an alert. What is this?
[4194.50s -> 4199.78s]  Secretly developing an all new brand of cheapy gear. Isn't that exciting?
[4205.22s -> 4214.38s]  10 million? Wait, did it happen? Did I really pass 10 million views on Twitch?
[4222.74s -> 4232.94s]  Let's see. There it is. 10 million. 331. Hey. Hey, everybody. 10 million.
[4237.82s -> 4257.67s]  Base reveal. The wing came in. Thanks to the 10 million views, guys. That's a lot of people that
[4257.67s -> 4277.29s]  have clicked on the stream. That's a lot of clicks. We need a speech. Let's get to 25 million. That's
[4277.29s -> 4292.84s]  a new milestone. 25 million views. What a speech. Dude, 10 million views. Give us a speech. What a
[4292.84s -> 4311.48s]  milestone. Get me to 25 million. Okay. Anything else? No. You're welcome. Thanks. All right.
[4313.08s -> 4323.70s]  Seriously, give an Animal Crossing speech. That's it. Can I do anything else with the family?
[4325.10s -> 4333.91s]  Animal Crossing. All right. I'm going to the foyer. Where's the foyer? We need to do...
[4334.63s -> 4338.86s]  All right. To the foyer. There's a sound coming from the foyer. Let's do it.
[4339.74s -> 4360.41s]  Do a credit card reveal. Hey, guys. You got the 10 million views. Here's all my credit cards.
[4362.18s -> 4377.26s]  Hey, who's that? Hex Frisco. Yes, sir. I want to report immediately. What is that thing?
[4378.46s -> 4385.74s]  Omitted intruder, sir. I think it came from the living room, sir. From a form of perimeter, man.
[4386.70s -> 4416.22s]  Yes, sir. Go, go, go. Defensive positions. There's a lot more than I thought there was. M&Ms.
[4418.46s -> 4442.94s]  Nice move. What the fuck was that for? He just killed that guy. An unauthorized intruder has
[4442.94s -> 4448.86s]  entered the area. Free ranger's pride is at stake. Stop the intruder or I'll make you egg salad.
[4449.66s -> 4454.82s]  If he comes into range, let him have it. Don't let your guard down, men.
[4461.35s -> 4466.15s]  Um, I just look for a plug. T.B. Robo, this isn't good.
[4467.43s -> 4470.71s]  No. Yes, it's not good. Wait. No, it isn't good. Or yes, it's not good.
[4471.83s -> 4476.39s]  It's kind of a hard way to answer that question. This isn't good. Yes, it isn't good. Yes, that's
[4476.39s -> 4489.40s]  yes, it is not good. Okay. Strange sound is coming from over there. It'll be really hard
[4489.40s -> 4503.86s]  to get over there. These rangers mean business. Okay. Well, then so do I. Don't think I mean
[4503.86s -> 4515.99s]  business too. This is okay. Let's put it away. First person mode is here. Well, how do I go
[4515.99s -> 4534.87s]  to first person? I can't go to first person. Z? You can't move and go FPS. It's not Z.
[4535.99s -> 4544.90s]  It's why? Why? Why? Why? Okay. Okay. Hold on. I'll just plug in.
[4544.90s -> 4568.06s]  All right. Now they're fucking dead. Just stay plugged in.
[4570.30s -> 4572.86s]  And where's the extension cord? Why can't I just stay plugged into the wall?
[4574.65s -> 4586.54s]  Uh, I don't need to save right now. All right. Why? Where is it? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All
[4586.54s -> 4606.73s]  right. Let's go. Let's go FPS these guys. Here we go. Unauthorized intruder. Don't let him pass.
[4608.23s -> 4618.38s]  Take him out. T.B. Robo, this isn't good. Yes, it isn't good. It's going to be really hard to
[4618.38s -> 4622.86s]  get over there. You'll never get through unless you find something you can use to cover yourself.
[4636.49s -> 4640.49s]  Okay. Literally impossible. Literally impossible. Literally impossible without a new item.
[4648.49s -> 4654.06s]  This action is physically impossible. It's not possible. T.B. Robo, you can't do it. I get
[4654.06s -> 4663.72s]  yelled at every time I go. All right. Physically impossible without a shield. Run? That's physically
[4663.72s -> 4668.60s]  impossible. The television told me. Everything you see on the television that comes out of the
[4668.60s -> 4690.02s]  television's mouth is real. You can't move while in first person. I want to do the thing I wanted
[4690.02s -> 4700.42s]  to do before. I want to go up over this way. Oh, look. This is up there. Okay. So I want to go.
[4700.42s -> 4706.10s]  Oh, I love this game. Okay. We're going to go up there. Up the lamp. Over there. Open the secret
[4706.10s -> 4729.29s]  door. We're going to fall on the top of the couch. Grab the coins. What a good game. Get up there.
[4734.28s -> 4753.90s]  Boy, mate. Turn on the telly. All right. Put it away. Let's go. Now, can I get that door again?
[4754.54s -> 4762.92s]  Anything from here that I can do? Wait, what's that? Can I climb that?
[4764.44s -> 4785.72s]  Maybe. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not solid. I thought this shit was solid.
[4793.98s -> 4801.00s]  Jump over it. What's the problem? Let's get this money again.
[4811.35s -> 4818.65s]  Fuck it. Okay. I already got it. It was a permanent. Okay. Because it took the money.
[4818.65s -> 4823.85s]  All right. From here, what am I doing? I got to get a good look. I'm going to push this down.
[4823.85s -> 4836.06s]  I'm not going to fuck this up this time. Okay. Walk down. Now, I'm going to float from here
[4837.18s -> 4855.24s]  over there. Can I make it? Float down? What was in the box? All right. What was in the box?
[4855.80s -> 4887.08s]  What was in the box? D-Squad. What? I didn't, I thought I was, I didn't even know what was
[4887.08s -> 4899.00s]  supposed to be in it. All right. Can't return this way. All right. No for you. We're going to
[4899.00s -> 4917.16s]  the kitchen. Kitchen time. Say hi to the frog girl. I already did. All right. We're going to
[4917.16s -> 4931.27s]  the kitchen. Turn around. Can I go in the kitchen yet? Is the kitchen open? I guess so. Oh yeah. The
[4931.27s -> 4949.67s]  puppet thing was in here. Kitchen. What we got? Oh no. Just being eaten alive by the dog.
[4950.39s -> 4963.99s]  What's a dog toy? That's okay. It's a dog toy. That makes sense. That's a dog toy.
[4964.63s -> 4990.60s]  Let's plug it in. Dogs are friends. Does it make her any less human? Well, if you're a dog toy,
[4990.60s -> 5011.11s]  that means you are not a human. You are a stuffed dog toy. Crash. Can I get, can I crawl?
[5012.39s -> 5020.66s]  Oh, whoa. This is the dog's bed. Wait, hold on. How do I get up here? I can't get up there.
[5021.38s -> 5025.94s]  There's a box and there's like a necklace up there. All right. Well, I, I, I get it later.
[5026.82s -> 5040.49s]  Little track. Can I open it? I can open this thing up for her. Can this be opened? Nope.
[5040.49s -> 5046.47s]  Are you talking to the dog? What's the dog going to say?
[5050.12s -> 5075.61s]  Tao. Not in the house. Yipe. Yipe. Climb the chair. Oh, can I peel the sticker off?
[5076.17s -> 5098.39s]  Or can I shoot the sticker off? Uh-huh. Let's get up here. There's a gold coin. A new spot.
[5098.55s -> 5108.36s]  To find trinkets. It's shit. What's up here? Oh, what am I going to do? Okay. I can grab that.
[5109.16s -> 5124.30s]  Can I not grab that? I can't grab like the yarn. There we go. Keep going. What else is over here?
[5127.56s -> 5142.14s]  All right. Get on this. No! Oh, what's the, what's the point of being on the towel? Wait,
[5142.14s -> 5155.13s]  what does it want to do with the milk? Oh, this trash. Okay. Toaster. Do I make toast?
[5156.41s -> 5163.22s]  Did I plug into the toaster? Come on. I've got to be able to do something with the toaster.
[5163.94s -> 5170.97s]  All right. This time I'm not going to push that off yet because I know I'm going to need it.
[5171.85s -> 5188.20s]  Right? Let's keep going up while I still have power. What is all the way up here? Oh, there's
[5188.20s -> 5210.07s]  a door. There's a demon door up here. Can I grab onto the clock? Let's go. Pretty high too. Nice.
[5212.65s -> 5225.38s]  All right. Now let's, I want to take a look. Mug. Spoon. Dog tags. Okay. I could float from here to
[5225.38s -> 5232.23s]  there and get the dog tags. I could go get the spoon. There's a bandage. There's a frog ring.
[5232.87s -> 5242.10s]  Go to mom. All right. I got to go from here to there. All right. Let's make it. Let's go. Let's
[5242.10s -> 5252.20s]  go. I need an outlet. Can I grab this thing when it comes back around? Can I jump onto the clock?
[5252.84s -> 5260.65s]  Or should I just float from here to there? I don't know. I'm, this is kind of freaking me out.
[5261.21s -> 5264.87s]  Can I hold onto it? All right. Let's go. Hurry up. What's the fast forward time button?
[5270.14s -> 5295.18s]  Jump in the toaster. Hey, can I grab it? Grab the, grab it. I can't grab it. Toaster. I need a
[5295.18s -> 5303.14s]  battery. I need a plug. I need a plug. I need a plug. I need a plug. Where's the plugs in here?
[5303.86s -> 5307.06s]  I need a plug right now. Come on. There's got to be an outlet over here. Ah.
[5307.94s -> 5324.20s]  Where's the, okay. There's a plug across. Oh, fuck. Um, all right. I'm going to go for it.
[5325.59s -> 5347.24s]  I don't, I'm dead. I can't make that shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5347.96s -> 5367.67s]  How do I, I just did so much stuff. I'm not going to move. Time's going to run out. Go to the plug.
[5367.67s -> 5387.53s]  I can't make it. Five, four. Oh, I can make it. Yes. Oh yes. Ah, I didn't know if I could make it.
[5391.99s -> 5398.65s]  Stop dying. I've only died once. I've only died one time. Come on. Stop dying in plies. I've died
[5398.65s -> 5425.85s]  like five times. What the fuck was that? Where did that come from? Oh, am I all right? I fell off.
[5425.85s -> 5436.71s]  All right. Well, I already got this one, right? Yeah, I got that coming in. Can I get and let's
[5436.71s -> 5452.06s]  talk to mom in the few minutes we have left. What about the dog poop? Can I talk to mom?
[5452.06s -> 5470.70s]  I'm busy right now, Tao. It's me. Boy, I can climb this. These little lips. Oh, that's it.
[5471.58s -> 5484.82s]  Wait. Grr. Grr. Be quiet, Tao. If I can get up there. Look out.
[5484.82s -> 5494.28s]  That was close. You almost hurt yourself. What? You be careful, Chibo. I was trying to figure
[5494.28s -> 5521.18s]  out what people call him. It's Chibo. Mug. Oh, Chibo. I'm sorry for saying you were a waste of
[5521.18s -> 5527.26s]  moolah on Jenny's birthday. I'm making my husband sleep on the sofa until he's sorry for what he
[5527.26s -> 5531.66s]  did. What? I thought you just said sorry to me. Don't worry about it. It's his fault, not yours.
[5532.54s -> 5550.31s]  Mug. My mug. That's a Drake Red Crest mug. Cool. Chibo, that belongs to my husband. I don't know if...
[5550.31s -> 5557.83s]  Oh, forget it. Go ahead and take it. He's got so much Drake Red Crest stuff. He'll never know I
[5557.83s -> 5572.87s]  gave something away. Get rid of this fruit. It flies everywhere, mom. Come on. Really? Disgusting.
[5573.59s -> 5584.70s]  All right. I got like 10 seconds before this is over. We'll collect a few coins. Turn the stove on.
[5589.13s -> 5601.22s]  Can I turn on the stove? Turn all burners on. I guess I can climb it. Can I not climb that?
[5605.42s -> 5628.17s]  It's a ladder? It is a ladder. All right. Should I get this thing? The ladle? A pan? Wait. A fan up
[5628.17s -> 5636.18s]  here. Oh, I can clean this. There's oil up here. All right. Give me the cleaning brush. Nice.
[5636.82s -> 5658.57s]  Oh, look. More oil. That's it? There's a little more. That was a tough one. Any more oil? Hey,
[5658.57s -> 5666.58s]  Lord Repta. Lord Repta, thanks for the five community subs. And also Bitslave gave another
[5666.58s -> 5676.15s]  $50. So Bitslave is at 10,000 bits today, which is fucking crazy. A lot of money, Bitslave.
[5677.11s -> 5681.83s]  Bitslave says, do you have any plans on Majora's Mask or Wind Waker? Maybe both. I do not.
[5684.39s -> 5695.34s]  I do not have a plan to play any Zelda games. I'm sorry to say. Well, plan on it.
[5699.50s -> 5705.42s]  I don't know. Look, I got all this to do first. I got Mario Sunshine to do first. That's priority
[5705.50s -> 5711.74s]  number one. I was slowly going up the rankings now, not as fast as it was before.
[5721.37s -> 5726.07s]  I also played those old Zelda games when they first came out.
[5729.61s -> 5732.33s]  I did Ocarina of Time. I don't think I ever beat Majora's Mask.
[5742.71s -> 5756.04s]  All right. Okay. I'm going to say something. I'm going to say something.
[5758.95s -> 5767.24s]  This is a real, real opinion that everybody's going to hate me for.
[5767.96s -> 5779.27s]  I think I've said this before on stream. Zelda games, although I respect everything they've done
[5779.27s -> 5787.93s]  for the industry, I respect it as a series. I understand why people love it. They don't do it
[5787.93s -> 5797.46s]  for me. Zelda games don't do it for me. That's it. Of course I know everything. It's an incredible,
[5797.46s -> 5804.60s]  incredible series. It just doesn't really do it for me. That's it.
[5804.60s -> 5820.41s]  That's it. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. I've played through all of Ocarina of Time
[5820.41s -> 5827.45s]  and it is fantastic. It's very, very good, but I'm just not into them. I'm just not into
[5827.45s -> 5831.37s]  Zelda games. I'm just not into them. I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry, but I'm going to be truthful
[5831.37s -> 5840.71s]  with you guys. I'm not going to lie to you. Now, that wasn't a wink to tell you. Just kidding.
[5840.71s -> 5844.31s]  This is a joke that I actually do love the whole series and I played all the time. That's a wink
[5844.31s -> 5855.96s]  because somebody paid 75,000 channel points. Breath of the Wild, that'll change your mind. Yes,
[5855.96s -> 5860.52s]  now Breath of the Wild is a different story, I think. I probably would really, really like that
[5860.52s -> 5876.30s]  game. Something fell. Look, it's the chibi-robo-chibi manual. All right, well, what is it?
[5877.18s -> 5888.97s]  Breath of the Wild sucks, in my opinion. Everything I've seen of it, it seems more my jam.
[5888.97s -> 5895.51s]  It seems more my style. We'll probably end up playing that at some point. I'm certain
[5895.51s -> 5898.71s]  I would probably really love it. I've already stored this in my memory banks, but I think
[5898.71s -> 5907.13s]  you should read it. Okay, let's read it. Chibi manual. Thank you for purchasing chibi-robo,
[5907.13s -> 5913.53s]  a member of the Citrus Soft Robotics family. We appreciate your support. Chapter one book.
[5915.48s -> 5922.41s]  All right, well, this is just the game manual. Welcome to the family. Welcome to the family,
[5923.29s -> 5938.87s]  can I get on his hand? All right, get on it. You're missing Laura. No, I want to get back in the
[5938.87s -> 5949.46s]  kitchen. All right, back to the kitchen. Oh, let's log in after the kitchen. I've still got to get
[5949.46s -> 5976.65s]  up there too. Put his hand in water. You've recharged 15 times. Are you going to save?
[5976.65s -> 5991.61s]  What is that saying? I'm doing two? I'm overcharging? Ribbit robot squad. All right,
[5991.61s -> 5997.14s]  now I'm going to go into. All right, let's clean up this shit because look at this dog
[5997.14s -> 6016.94s]  shit all over the place. Lord mega law, Lord mega law. You only have 50 charging cycles left.
[6018.30s -> 6036.89s]  All right, now is the dog sleeping in here? Oh, where's the dog? Clearly no dog in there.
[6036.89s -> 6053.85s]  Yeah. Well, wait a minute. What a fucking mess. It's a sound. I'm busy cleaning.
[6053.85s -> 6073.70s]  This is just easy happy points. It's like 10, 20 happy points. There's a little cleaning bot.
[6073.70s -> 6078.58s]  All right, now you're the blaster. Does this actually work? Was I being lied to?
[6080.02s -> 6094.30s]  Sorry, I was a lie. Chibi robot, please. Jesus Christ. What is this? Frog? What's a frog bus?
[6095.02s -> 6108.54s]  Okay. Nice. Yeah. All right. That's a good image. It's the bus story. Yeah.
[6111.78s -> 6139.34s]  Um, I will. Wait, what's this? Why is it all me? And by the way, the frog was a lot further away,
[6139.34s -> 6150.49s]  at least 200 feet away from the bus stop. All right, I need a battery pack charging station,
[6150.49s -> 6166.38s]  which is over here. And then I'm going back up. I'm going up to the top. This world is a
[6166.38s -> 6174.49s]  journalist world. Awesome. The guy was going so crazy. He was doing so many movements.
[6175.45s -> 6185.08s]  I need to go explore over here in the kitchen. Oh, look it. She's on the counter.
[6185.08s -> 6192.22s]  I gotta go visit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Quest, quest, quest. Give me a mission. Give me something
[6192.22s -> 6218.79s]  to do. Hello. What do you got? Just thinking about being near Drake makes me nervous. That's why
[6218.79s -> 6224.39s]  there's no way I can confess. After all, I'm just a woman who gets used as a dog's plaything. I'm
[6224.39s -> 6247.96s]  nothing. Jesus. Drake? Oh my, you're here to see me, you little old bee. Wait a second.
[6249.14s -> 6259.40s]  You're much smaller than Drake. Is that you, Chibi Robo? Uh oh. Uh, no. Uh, do I know? Yes.
[6259.40s -> 6271.00s]  What should I say? Busted. No, it's not me. It's, it's Drake. No, it's not. No, it's me,
[6271.00s -> 6278.02s]  Drake. You can't fool me. Drake is much too manly to be so small. Don't startle me like that.
[6278.58s -> 6296.36s]  All right, let's say yes. Drake? Oh my, you're here to see me? You're much smaller than Drake.
[6296.36s -> 6307.19s]  Is that you, Chibi Robo? Yeah, it's me. Whatever. I want to go this way because there's probably
[6307.19s -> 6309.91s]  something else I can do over here. There's coins. There's fish over here too. Can I feed the fish?
[6310.55s -> 6324.60s]  What can I do? You want to give something to the fish? Cookie crumbs. Cookies? Let's give
[6324.60s -> 6342.79s]  cookies. Cookie crumbs? You got 16 happy points. Wow. And they paid me 16 bucks.
[6344.76s -> 6354.98s]  Are there any more cookies? Would I like a twig? Should I put a twig in here? I mean,
[6354.98s -> 6360.95s]  maybe a little more environment stuff. No, they can't eat that. All right, well, I'm not gonna
[6360.95s -> 6373.34s]  give them trash. What does this do? Okay, let's keep going. There's more. There's a bug over here.
[6374.14s -> 6387.37s]  Let's charge up. Fish love trash. Um, I, no, nothing else.
[6390.78s -> 6403.48s]  Am I gonna save? No, no need. Is it a jar of honey? Oh, okay, there's another demon door over there.
[6404.28s -> 6408.74s]  What is, what about this? Pick up the honey. Pick up the jar.
[6409.70s -> 6416.26s]  This is coins. Ooh, that's a demon door. All right, hold on. Let me, I gotta get up here.
[6417.06s -> 6430.82s]  I can't climb that. Oh, but I can't climb this can of beans or whatever this is. No way.
[6431.94s -> 6451.90s]  I know the sound. Shit, I can't get up there. I have to go up this way. Um, hold on. Let me see.
[6453.50s -> 6460.94s]  If I go up here, I can. Okay, wait, there's a spoon up there. There's a spoon. All right,
[6460.94s -> 6473.96s]  I'm gonna go this way. Wait, wait, what? Can I go down here? Can I get back up?
[6474.68s -> 6494.98s]  Should I go in the drain? What the fuck? I, I've got, I'm going to unclog the drain.
[6503.18s -> 6510.73s]  This is crazy. Chibi, you just earned a cleaning bonus. Your happy point bonus is
[6511.85s -> 6517.90s]  15. This game would make a really good base for a counter-strike map.
[6517.90s -> 6536.17s]  Any more trash? Dirt over here. More over here. Let's keep going.
[6538.25s -> 6547.48s]  Trash is down here. Look at this. Disgusting over here.
[6550.15s -> 6572.09s]  It's all this junk. Okay, gonna fly for us. What's that? There's a rat!
[6576.28s -> 6590.65s]  Uh, shoot him. I'm almost out of battery. I gotta go back up. All right, I'm almost out of battery.
[6590.65s -> 6605.98s]  Look at how much money's down here. I gotta go. I gotta go. The audio is fucked up. I think this
[6605.98s -> 6620.46s]  is the game. It's not happening anywhere else. I think that doesn't happen up here.
[6621.58s -> 6637.91s]  Yeah, that's only happening in certain places. Uh, okay. Um, I need, where's that, where's that
[6637.91s -> 6661.51s]  battery? Like right here? Right there. I'm dead. I'm right here. Lower the game audio in the settings.
[6662.39s -> 6679.08s]  I don't, I don't think this, I can't even do that. Lower the game difficulty.
[6680.92s -> 6685.35s]  Should I go back down? All right, I'm gonna charge. I'm gonna charge and then go back down
[6685.35s -> 6701.13s]  into the rat cave. You're gonna hear some crackling, but it's all right. In the emulator settings.
[6701.13s -> 6715.50s]  This is not on an emulator. All right, let me go back down. I want to fight the rat.
[6726.54s -> 6734.54s]  Technically, the Wii plays GameCube games by emulating them. Okay, fine. Okay. Sure.
[6735.34s -> 6743.72s]  It's, it's emulated. All right. That's not even, that's not even true because the Wii is just a
[6743.72s -> 6752.49s]  GameCube. We already went up with these yesterday. The Wii is a GameCube. All right. Don't clean.
[6752.49s -> 6768.57s]  Don't clean. Nope. I'm compulsively cleaning. I want to kill that run. All right. So the plan is
[6769.21s -> 6788.50s]  get those coins. If I see a rat, shoot it with blaster. Any rats down here? No rat, right?
[6789.06s -> 6796.62s]  I want those coins. Can I knock this down? All right. There's a rat in there. All right. This is
[6796.62s -> 6827.78s]  blocked. All right. Blaster. Let's shoot him. Um, wait. What's this? Um, can I jump? It's to hide.
[6828.42s -> 6831.56s]  Is there any way I can climb up or anything? I can't climb up like this.
[6832.52s -> 6850.78s]  Shit. How do I get up there? I can get up there. Try to push the thing over with the blaster.
[6852.06s -> 6859.96s]  It probably is like a, I'm going to assume there's a spring. Yeah. No. It's probably a spring.
[6860.92s -> 6867.85s]  Let's get out of here. We'll come back here later. There's a lot of money over there too.
[6868.81s -> 6888.02s]  Yeah. We'll come back here later. Dragged you down by the cord. Oh fuck. I'm getting low.
[6888.66s -> 6900.50s]  I'm getting low. I'm getting low. I'm getting low. Oh no. Oh no. Is it?
[6900.50s -> 6915.69s]  Is it three? We're good. All right. That's cool to know.
[6917.67s -> 6926.74s]  Remember the drain because I got to remember the drain. I'm going back down there. When I get this
[6926.74s -> 6933.43s]  guys, you said this is like Zelda. No, this is like a Metroidvania. I'd say that's more
[6933.43s -> 6937.19s]  like a, well actually Zelda is like a Metroidvania kind of. Yeah. You're right. Fuck.
[6939.69s -> 6944.41s]  You get an item to come back and do something else later. Yeah.
[6945.05s -> 6951.32s]  And it is like a Metroidvania. Oh wait. This is the dog house.
[6957.43s -> 6965.59s]  Shit. These are the dog tags, right?
[6969.94s -> 6980.71s]  TV robo. The free rangers were wearing the same kind of things around their necks.
[6980.71s -> 6987.96s]  Safe passage now, right? All right. Somebody said to do that. It doesn't work.
[6992.14s -> 7006.02s]  Five happy points. All right. Nice. So now I can go back to the, we'll go back to the foyer.
[7006.58s -> 7024.57s]  I might not have enough daytime for this. Again, fully recharged. Are you going to save the game?
[7024.57s -> 7035.50s]  No. What am I playing this on? I'm playing this on a Wii. I have, that's going to keep happening.
[7035.50s -> 7043.64s]  I think I have a Wii which is plugged in HD and I'm using the original GameCube game chibi robo
[7045.37s -> 7049.53s]  and that is capturing through a capture card, which is being shown to you on the screen right
[7049.53s -> 7062.04s]  now. Show the disc. I did yesterday. What's with this? Like I need to prove I did this yesterday.
[7063.93s -> 7083.27s]  I did this exact thing yesterday. I'm here. Where are those demon doors? I have enough time to just
[7083.27s -> 7092.47s]  fuck around out here. Let's go outside. I have plenty of battery. Let's go. Remember, you can't
[7092.47s -> 7104.12s]  afford chibi robo. It's just like, what does that even mean? Yeah. What are you talking about?
[7104.12s -> 7114.34s]  You can't even, you can't afford chibi robo. Oh, I got to throw my trash away. It's a dead frog.
[7114.34s -> 7126.78s]  Oh no. Oh no. Ribbit, ribbit, wheeze. I need frog medicine. She's all dehydrated and shriveled.
[7128.02s -> 7132.50s]  Hasn't rained lately and it looks like she's really weak. This is so distressing. We have to
[7132.50s -> 7175.38s]  get her some water. Mug into the sink with water. Is there a hose out here? Stop cleaning. She's
[7175.38s -> 7186.38s]  dead. I need, I don't know where to get water. Oh, I saved an ant. Wait, there's water right here.
[7186.38s -> 7216.63s]  How do I open this? That's like a water symbol, right? Crown pound? The tap in the kitchen?
[7217.59s -> 7232.04s]  Or is there a hose? Oh no, I think it's just a weird symbol. Oh, is there a hose out here?
[7234.79s -> 7239.43s]  I got a decent amount of money.
[7242.74s -> 7250.73s]  Is there a hose out here? You'd think there might be. I mean, can I get up this? Climb a tree?
[7255.80s -> 7274.78s]  Hose. Water. Some kind of water hose. Over here? What can I do with, lay on this?
[7276.87s -> 7298.89s]  What is that? Uh, it doesn't do anything. Well, we'll see you tomorrow, frog. Dead. The frog's
[7298.89s -> 7318.66s]  gonna be fine. Morning. Suggest your happy point. Your chibi ranking has gone from. That's a lot,
[7318.66s -> 7338.81s]  actually. 93 more happy points. Hooray. If you see a sunshine sticker, I suggest you pop it with your
[7338.81s -> 7346.33s]  chibi blaster. Try using your chibi vision as a scope. I know that already. Would you like to
[7346.33s -> 7355.21s]  save? Yes, I would. I also want to try this. I want to try this. Give me one second while I do this.
[7356.09s -> 7365.22s]  Let me see if I can. I think it's just the way that it's being fed through. Ladies and
[7365.22s -> 7371.50s]  gentlemen, I just fixed it. It's been fixed. I just fixed it. You should not hear any more
[7371.50s -> 7388.18s]  cracking or popping ever again. It's been fixed. Thank you for the applause. I hope I did fix it.
[7388.18s -> 7403.19s]  Let's see if I can prove it. He said that last time, too. No, no, this actually should work.
[7403.91s -> 7413.26s]  Let's see. Because through my capture device, I could see it peaking when I just pulled it up.
[7413.26s -> 7416.94s]  So it should no longer be peaking on my capture device, which means I'm going to
[7416.94s -> 7424.22s]  artificially inflate the sound like this. So I've artificially inflated the sound.
[7426.95s -> 7439.83s]  I've dropped the actual input. We'll find out. You tell me if you still hear it. All right.
[7440.71s -> 7455.05s]  Let's put the dog tags on. Do I just own them? I think I just own them. Crackling
[7455.05s -> 7465.14s]  sound made it more authentic. Let's go to the fort. I now have a dog tag.
[7466.74s -> 7470.17s]  I would clean this up, but I mean, I can't leave a mess.
[7471.13s -> 7475.13s]  I told you this and you wonder why I can't play Luigi's Mansion 3.
[7476.01s -> 7504.17s]  Because it sucks? No, because I suck up everything. I suck up everything. It's bad.
[7504.17s -> 7521.16s]  I have dog tags. Unauthorized intruder. Don't let him pass. Take him out. What? Keep your rubble.
[7521.16s -> 7528.02s]  This isn't good. Yes. It's gonna be really hard to get over there. These rangers mean business.
[7528.02s -> 7531.27s]  The only way to get through this is to find something you can use to cover yourself. Well, I can.
[7536.63s -> 7555.40s]  Haha. Haha. All right. Where am I going? Where does it want me to go? In the basement? Does this
[7555.40s -> 7571.94s]  thing have infinite health? Is it gonna break? How do I get to the basement? Over here? Son of a
[7572.90s -> 7582.14s]  battle tank. Well, I guess he didn't look like an enemy. Come to think of it, he may be an ally.
[7583.10s -> 7585.91s]  But still, my men were just pitiful.
[7587.91s -> 7595.88s]  TV robo. I can't believe my electronic eyes. That was truly amazing. You ran through those
[7595.88s -> 7602.28s]  fearsome free ranges without getting shot. They really are superb. Of course, I was able to fly
[7602.28s -> 7612.02s]  right over them. Uh oh. Larry David just said something potentially controversial.
[7612.10s -> 7614.25s]  That strange sound seems to have come from here.
[7617.80s -> 7620.68s]  Between you and me, I'm a little scared, but I think we'd better go investigate.
[7625.66s -> 7651.56s]  Okay. Outlets in the basement? Staircase. Oh man. Easy. Easy. All right. Push it off to get the
[7651.56s -> 7666.65s]  the goods inside. Oops. Can I get back up? Five happy points. Nice. Okay. Wait, what? Is there
[7666.65s -> 7676.30s]  something up here? I gotta go to a wastebasket. I probably have a lot of stuff here. I haven't
[7676.30s -> 7690.12s]  done it in a while. All right. Cool. Wow. Look at all this trash. It's so much of it.
[7691.40s -> 7707.93s]  Empty bottle. Broken bottle. All right. There's gotta be an outlet down here. Everybody has
[7707.93s -> 7712.65s]  outlets in the basement. How the fuck does your laundry machine knock? You know what I'm saying?
[7712.65s -> 7723.27s]  Where is it? Yeah. There's an outlet right across the way. All right. We're good. Where is it? Just
[7723.27s -> 7733.45s]  so I can make sure I know where it is. All right. Clean this up. The tough mess. Do I appear at the
[7733.45s -> 7757.45s]  toothbrush at any time? All right. Mess contained. Any more? Yeah. Oil over here. Nice. All right.
[7757.45s -> 7765.35s]  Wait. I know. I know. I'll be fine. There's a little bit more oil over here. Cleaning bonus.
[7767.21s -> 7784.73s]  Whoa. That was loud and crackling. Well, I think it's just the way that the Wii plays the GameCube
[7784.73s -> 7806.20s]  game. I mean, this is not like there's anything weird going on here. Good emulator. I need to
[7806.20s -> 7821.24s]  update the emulator. There's no updating emulator. I mean, I thought it was fixed. I looked over at
[7821.24s -> 7830.30s]  my gacha software and it was blowing out into the red. I guess not. I can power this person.
[7830.30s -> 7837.80s]  Hold on. I gotta clean this shit up. I think it might be the memory card.
[7840.68s -> 7861.42s]  Can I power him on? It's probably like a boss fight. I'm not doing this yet.
[7861.42s -> 7871.21s]  How were the tacos last night? They were fucking incredible. All right. Well, let's blast this.
[7871.21s -> 7883.08s]  I had a range.
[7891.11s -> 7891.43s]  Really?
[7904.50s -> 7932.98s]  Fully charged. This is a half-life puzzle. All right. Let's turn this guy on and hopefully not
[7932.98s -> 7938.46s]  blow out everybody's speakers with the loud crackling noises that the original GameCube
[7938.54s -> 7966.36s]  disc in the original Wii does. That's part of the game. Chibi-Robo. Are you all right?
[7968.66s -> 7975.37s]  I think so. Stop fooling around. Come on. This place gives me the creeps.
[7976.01s -> 7984.04s]  Hurry and get out of here. Oh, your eyes.
[7988.82s -> 7999.62s]  He fried his circuit. No. Chibi-Robo.
[7999.62s -> 8016.42s]  Don't die. No. What is going on? Am I going through like robot? Is this me and my family?
[8017.22s -> 8051.51s]  Wait, I've downloaded all his memories. This guy's huge. Emulator virus. But then they powered him
[8051.51s -> 8063.67s]  down because he ran out of battery. What's he doing? Is he... was he catching? When he threw a frisbee at
[8063.67s -> 8087.53s]  him too hard? Wait, he got beamed up? $100,000 to fix? Too much money to fix. Too expensive. That's
[8087.53s -> 8102.84s]  so sad. We can make that money. That's the whole game. Too much electric bill. Chibi-Robo. You died.
[8108.23s -> 8132.57s]  Huh? Ah, phone call for Telly. Gotta go. Wait, he's gonna dip out like that, Telly? They just
[8132.57s -> 8143.18s]  gave birth. I can't believe he can move after all this time. I wonder what this might be.
[8143.90s -> 8163.72s]  More importantly, Chibi-Robo. We would just get... Can you cry into the mug
[8165.05s -> 8172.14s]  and dump it in the frog's mouth? We were just getting used to this house and now you die and
[8173.10s -> 8189.40s]  leave me all alone. Alone. Alone. No, alone. This took a really sad turn. I was just cleaning
[8189.40s -> 8207.66s]  stuff with a toothbrush. I'm fine, see? Oh, you're alive. I'm so glad, Chibi-Robo. I thought you'd
[8207.66s -> 8216.46s]  kick the bucket. I suppose I shouldn't have worried. I was gonna fix you no matter what, even if I had
[8216.46s -> 8226.89s]  to use my own parts. What a true friend. So tell me, did you dream? Yes. You didn't dream, right? I
[8226.89s -> 8232.71s]  just said I did. It's quite possible that you downloaded data from Giga-Robo's memory banks.
[8235.03s -> 8244.22s]  All this excitement is really talking me out. See you later, Chibi-Robo. This is Giga-Robo and
[8244.22s -> 8271.66s]  Chibi-Robo. Giga. Let's pick up this thing. Giga battery. Giga-Robo, wow, that's a...
[8272.62s -> 8287.83s]  What is it? If you plan to take that battery, I'd thank you to charge it up and bring it back in
[8287.83s -> 8307.88s]  one piece. And yet, that's not what you want, is it? You colossal matey. It's Gino. It's fat Gino.
[8308.44s -> 8315.10s]  This is where he's been the whole time. This is where he's been. They've kept him in a basement.
[8316.60s -> 8329.34s]  Grotto's hair. If only you could speak to me, Giga-Robo. Is that really a Giga-Robo? Is he
[8329.74s -> 8342.52s]  d-d-d-dead? Robots don't die, you flying boy. Oh, right. He sure is big. He's a lot taller than
[8342.52s -> 8350.47s]  you, Chibi-Robo. One moment. According to my data, he's a very old model. He started a trend known
[8350.47s -> 8357.56s]  as Giga-Robo fever a long time ago, but his energy consumption was too high and is popularly plummeted.
[8359.98s -> 8369.26s]  Shut your blowhole. You think you're smart, but you know nothing about him. I'm so sorry.
[8370.70s -> 8374.14s]  Anyway, thank you very much. If you'll excuse me.
[8375.58s -> 8381.27s]  Furl your sails, matey. You can't go anywhere yet.
[8381.27s -> 8387.51s]  Jerma has an opportunity to do an Irish pirate guy. He's gonna build this all stream.
[8389.16s -> 8397.32s]  You come blowin' in here like a summer, squall, and leave without introducing yourselves.
[8397.32s -> 8408.71s]  I'm sorry. Uh, my name is Telly, and that over there is Chibi-Robo. Don't mind him. He doesn't
[8408.71s -> 8425.53s]  talk much. And who might you be? It's about time you asked. My name's Captain Catview.
[8425.53s -> 8434.86s]  I'm the scourge of the seven seas, the overlord of the oceans blue, the king of all pirates,
[8434.86s -> 8448.06s]  Captain Plankbeard. You're a pirate? Hey, or at least I used to be. Now I'm
[8448.06s -> 8455.69s]  nothing more than a shipless landlubber. Oh, how did you lose your ship? That tail's as long as
[8455.69s -> 8464.97s]  the sea be deep, and as sad as a tailless mermaid. But me throat's as parched as me soul,
[8464.97s -> 8476.28s]  so I'll be safe in this story. But I mean, yeah, I love the taste of water. Oh, give me that.
[8476.28s -> 8482.04s]  What say ye? Will ye return some day and listen to me sad tale of woe? What a boring shitty pirate
[8482.04s -> 8488.82s]  character. I love the taste of water. Oh, I'm just so... Look at me. I've got me ship in...
[8488.82s -> 8496.84s]  Oh, I love water. Hydrate, kids. There's supposed to be rum in there or something.
[8496.92s -> 8503.83s]  There's supposed to be something in there with like three Xs on it. I promise.
[8507.67s -> 8511.26s]  Never make a promise you can't keep. That's the pirate's code.
[8514.46s -> 8523.32s]  Bugleberry voice. You do well to remember me words, you evergrown piece of plankton.
[8523.32s -> 8530.49s]  I won't forget them. Even if I die, I'll come back and remember them.
[8530.49s -> 8537.24s]  What did I tell ye? Robots don't die, and ye don't get a scurvy neither.
[8537.24s -> 8543.21s]  You're right. That gigabatter is no good by its lonesome.
[8543.21s -> 8546.41s]  You need to search the house and find the giga charger.
[8553.46s -> 8560.34s]  That was scary. Anyways, let's go back. Need to plug it in to a Tesla battery charger.
[8560.34s -> 8567.93s]  All right. Give me that water, though. He loves water. Give me that water. I want your water.
[8567.93s -> 8577.80s]  Nice. The gigabatter alone will do you no good. Take the giga charger with ye as well.
[8577.80s -> 8589.19s]  I, when the battery's full, juice bring it back here. Ah, yes. Okay. I can't get the water.
[8589.19s -> 8595.27s]  He loves water. I need water. All right. Can I do this now? Am I allowed to do this, yo?
[8596.23s -> 8606.31s]  Will we get coaxed? Are we still live? What are you talking about? I'm live.
[8607.19s -> 8614.20s]  I haven't dropped any frames. What are you talking about? Mini coax? I haven't dropped any frames.
[8614.20s -> 8616.92s]  I have zero dropped frames. Maybe it's a twitch problem. I don't know.
[8618.52s -> 8624.71s]  Looks like it's about to snap. I've tried this before. Come on. Let me get it.
[8631.58s -> 8632.08s]  Yeah.
[8632.08s -> 8646.60s]  Find you where you aimed that thing, laddie. I'd not see anyone hurt by ye careless ways.
[8646.60s -> 8655.69s]  Nice. I love it. Okay. Is this a photo? Shoot him. Why would I shoot him?
[8655.69s -> 8688.86s]  Boil. Pull. Trash. Get it. Oh, I gotta pull it out? Can I pull it out? Uh, well, we, uh,
[8688.86s -> 8699.12s]  I just got 20 community subs just came in right now from Jerma's average dong. Jerma's average
[8699.12s -> 8709.10s]  dong. Thanks for the 20 community subs. Gunpowder. Appreciate the 20 fucking subs, dude. Thank you.
[8712.78s -> 8720.91s]  Average. I'm not even going to respond to that. That's a lot of subs though. Thanks for the subs.
[8720.91s -> 8731.12s]  Jerma's, uh, by the way, it's, it's not average. It's Jerma's average dong. The average is misspelled.
[8731.12s -> 8741.85s]  Now let's float over there. So wait, do I have enough power for this, right?
[8741.85s -> 8754.94s]  Let's put this coins and shit. Ooh, wait. Okay. Um, all right. We got a, I need a better camera.
[8754.94s -> 8773.52s]  I'm going to float into the cage. What the fuck was that? All right. What are you doing, Chibi?
[8773.52s -> 8782.94s]  It's a dangerous game you be playing. Yarr. What be this? Aye, I see. You're searching for
[8782.94s -> 8789.88s]  Giga robots, Giga charger. Chibi, you be lad. You're a slippery fish to get a handle on.
[8789.88s -> 8798.96s]  Ha ha ha. Oh, there's a door up there. All right. I'm running out of, uh, all right, put this away.
[8800.16s -> 8820.59s]  So now I can climb that. Give me this. I think I found it. All right. Hold on. Can I, give me first
[8820.59s -> 8829.02s]  person? There's a frog ring there. I don't think I can make that though. Giga charger. All right.
[8829.02s -> 8837.47s]  But can I float from here to there? I don't think I can fly from here to there. That seems
[8837.47s -> 8854.65s]  like a long way. Just climb it. Can I climb it? Climb from the other side. Hold on. Let me just
[8854.65s -> 8862.78s]  get down here. Another 10 community subs from Jerma's average dong. I need battery before I do
[8862.78s -> 8882.67s]  any of this shit. No, no, no, no. Oh God. Oh God. Uh, thanks for the 10 community subs. 30 actually
[8882.67s -> 8890.60s]  from Jerma's average dong. Appreciate that. Five more community subs from Jerma's sucks.
[8891.58s -> 8896.22s]  You know, let's, you know, let's give some community subs. Uh, Jerma's dick. Jerma's sucks.
[8896.22s -> 8901.74s]  Jerma's, uh, Jerma's big dick. Jerma's average dick. Jerma's sucks. Jerma's sucks too. Jerma
[8901.74s -> 8909.29s]  lied about how big his dick was. How many of these do we have? How many? Like there's,
[8909.29s -> 8915.47s]  there's a hundred of these. It's so funny. All right. Climb up from here.
[8919.13s -> 8937.04s]  Not enough. Can I climb this? There's gotta be a way up there. Let me see. How do I get up there?
[8937.04s -> 8956.80s]  I can go from here. How do I get up there? Can I, all right. Can I float from one of these steps
[8956.80s -> 8964.28s]  over to there? The sling, this, the, the swing you were on. Can I get it from there? From where you
[8964.28s -> 8985.47s]  were? If I think it might be too far. Yeah. There's a bunch of bird shit in here. Hold on.
[8987.29s -> 9006.78s]  So from here, you, you saying you think I can make it from here?
[9007.98s -> 9013.71s]  I doubt it. Oh, I doubt it. I don't think I can go from here to there.
[9016.73s -> 9025.56s]  I climb, I'm going to climb up. Oh, I, I can climb up this fucking thing. Oh man. Nice. All right.
[9025.56s -> 9033.00s]  Hold on. I got, um, we'll come, we're going to come back. I need to move this. Oh, this is a way. It's
[9033.00s -> 9038.76s]  wasting battery. Jerma the rope. Jerma the rope. I know, I know, I know. Don't worry. I went up.
[9038.76s -> 9044.16s]  All right. I'm going to, oh, there's a demon door. What? I can't push this anymore. Why not?
[9044.16s -> 9056.08s]  Jerma the rope. Jerma the rope. I want to push this the other. Why can't I push this anymore?
[9056.08s -> 9065.93s]  All right. That's not important right now. The demon door is important. Now don't, I'm going to,
[9065.93s -> 9082.43s]  that's waste. Watch out for the bird shit. And I'm going to float down. Money, big money. All right.
[9082.43s -> 9088.51s]  Now we float. We float from here. Here. Okay. There's another demon door right there. Is there a plug?
[9088.51s -> 9093.96s]  All right. I'm going to, there's a plug right underneath me. Look, lit, literally. And I use
[9093.96s -> 9107.28s]  that word actually, literally. There's a plug right underneath me. Okay. This way. Get the frog
[9107.28s -> 9145.53s]  coin. Float down again. Monkey. I mean, I thought, I didn't think it was going to take that much
[9145.53s -> 9154.51s]  power to float down. I thought it went to zero. All right. I'm not done in here. I want to,
[9154.51s -> 9180.09s]  I want to get up the rope. I'm going to open that demon door. Same deal. I'm up.
[9180.09s -> 9193.96s]  A couple of nails. Frash? Or is this a block? I can probably float around it, but not yet. I want
[9193.96s -> 9225.13s]  to get this demon door. Okay. Put it away. Open. I've got two grin. That's a lot of money. I'm
[9225.13s -> 9235.16s]  almost out of time, but can I go up here? Is there anything else up here? I guess I can just go back.
[9235.16s -> 9243.96s]  And I can, wait, is there enough time to go get the, uh, I don't think there is. It's okay.
[9243.96s -> 9252.72s]  We're about to, it's about to turn off anyway. Save the frog. I got to come back here tomorrow.
[9253.28s -> 9258.00s]  This is the plan. Come back here tomorrow to get the, get the giga charger. You could have made it
[9258.00s -> 9266.41s]  monk ass. I don't think I'm going to save the frog. The frog will be fine. Am I going to save?
[9266.41s -> 9280.68s]  Of course I am. Do I have enough time to get it now? Maybe. Let's go chibi robo. The frog will die.
[9280.68s -> 9314.14s]  The frog is not going to die. This is a children's game. Game deal. Do I have enough time? Okay.
[9314.14s -> 9321.82s]  Float around here. That didn't work. That didn't work. That didn't work. That didn't work. That
[9321.82s -> 9324.86s]  didn't work. I thought I could float around it. I will come back tomorrow. Whatever. See you tomorrow.
[9337.53s -> 9352.16s]  Let's start the stream. Sorry. The other one. No. Time sure flies when you're making folks happy.
[9352.96s -> 9362.78s]  Back to the chibi house. Great work out there. Download.
[9365.82s -> 9376.78s]  I'm in top 1000. We're making it to the top 1000. Citrus office into your special. Get a brand new
[9376.78s -> 9397.20s]  bonus battery. Ooh, that's a lot. Now let's spend some money. We should do a happiness calculation
[9397.20s -> 9410.09s]  every stream. Top 1000 chibi robo stream. Giga robo who is making that noise.
[9411.85s -> 9416.81s]  You might not know it, but Giga robo is the brainchild of legendary engineer Dr. Joy
[9417.45s -> 9425.71s]  Ebisu of Citrusoft. He made you too. Even though he designed both you, Giga robo is 10 times
[9425.71s -> 9432.96s]  bigger than you are. He's a hundred times heavier. Don't get me started about his battery. Who made
[9432.96s -> 9439.44s]  you? He uses a thousand times more energy than you do. There was an energy crisis a few years back
[9440.32s -> 9446.25s]  and all at once everyone just stopped using their Giga robos all together. These days you can't even
[9446.25s -> 9451.56s]  pay someone to take the poor guy off your hands. Sad to see something like this happen off the side
[9451.56s -> 9460.89s]  like so much trash. Poor guy. Enough moping around. We've got work to do. Let's go earn us some happy
[9460.89s -> 9467.24s]  points. Every time you talk, my ears pop. How do we get you to stop talking? Just take out the
[9467.24s -> 9477.56s]  Giga battery you're carrying with you. That's it. Look at that. It's already bigger than you are,
[9477.56s -> 9502.08s]  chibi robo. Pretty heavy. Let's set it over there. Emulator noises. If you want to recharge that
[9502.08s -> 9506.08s]  Giga battery, you'll need to find a Giga charger. There's got to be one around here somewhere. I know
[9506.08s -> 9529.53s]  where it is. You and I both looked at it at the same time. All right, let's get this out. Okay.
[9529.53s -> 9540.25s]  Online shop. Charge chip. Chibi battery. Range chip. Hot rod. Space scrambler. There's a charge
[9540.25s -> 9547.64s]  chip. Enables the chibi blaster to fire a charged shot. Pretty good. Chibi battery. Chibi robo spare
[9547.64s -> 9561.08s]  battery. Yup. Range chip. Enables the chibi blaster to fire long distances. Nectar flower seed. A
[9561.08s -> 9574.06s]  cute nectar flower will grow from this seed. Charge shot. All right, I'll get it. I still don't have
[9574.06s -> 9596.01s]  enough money for any of this. Thank you for your visit. Charge chip. Chibi battery. Whoa. Chibi
[9596.01s -> 9615.53s]  drugs. You've upgraded. Let's go. Let's save it. Back to the downstairs. I want to get that charger.
[9615.53s -> 9637.68s]  Put the trash away. Yup. Clean up the confetti. Can I? I don't think I can. Oh, I can. Why are
[9637.68s -> 9646.94s]  you throwing trash everywhere? Is this trash? Wow. This is where your utility bots come from.
[9646.94s -> 9651.58s]  They're your backup buddies, your support bots. If you have scrap, we can make some utility bots
[9651.58s -> 9656.96s]  with the chibi PC. Think there's any scrap in this place? Okay, so that's where I put the scrap. All
[9656.96s -> 9669.77s]  right, let's go. Save frog, you monster. I'm on it. Soon. I need a waste basket. Okay, what do you
[9669.77s -> 9686.75s]  guys say? You guys say trash barrel, waste basket, trash can. What do you guys say? I say trash can.
[9687.88s -> 9705.40s]  Trash can. Or just the trash. Throw it in the trash. Speaking of which. Here we go. Two bottles.
[9706.64s -> 9725.63s]  Ooh, look at all that. More broken glass. That's a lot. You got a total of 86 happy points. Holy
[9725.63s -> 9735.82s]  shit. Chibi Robo doesn't recycle. Is that demon door? No, let's get that demon door open.
[9736.46s -> 9767.02s]  I bet Chibi throws his car batteries in the ocean.
[9778.43s -> 9812.30s]  Let's get a, let's plug in. It's illegal and free. Throw batteries in the ocean. You are
[9812.30s -> 9822.27s]  fucking crazy. What's wrong with you? No, I didn't even say the damn thing. Save it. Hey.
[9829.08s -> 9851.64s]  Baste. Shut up. Oh, baste. Throw your batteries in the ocean. Two hours and 40 minutes. What? Time
[9851.64s -> 9864.22s]  flies when you're cleaning up dirt. F***ing pollutants. Ooh, I still like, I still like,
[9864.22s -> 9869.69s]  I like can like get up there. I think, I think it was like a, it should be like a ladder. I can
[9869.69s -> 9881.76s]  like probably like get on or something. I don't know. Or like go from here. All right, back to
[9881.76s -> 9899.61s]  the basement. How is that a tuber? Me saying like a bunch of times is a tuber? People do that? E3
[9899.61s -> 9927.37s]  presenter? Uh oh. Crying ribbit girl on stairs. Demon door. Tears on the battlefield? Hi, it's me.
[9930.51s -> 9935.71s]  I thought, I thought this was mom. I thought this was mom's foot like going up to, I thought it was
[9935.71s -> 9958.51s]  mom standing here. Mom's like an elephant, apparently. Always charge. Always. I'm not going
[9958.51s -> 9976.80s]  to save. There are two demon doors. One here and then one under there. Elephant mom. I mean,
[9977.36s -> 9993.79s]  whatever. Manka A. What's Manka A? Oh, I didn't get one. Turn it back on. Let me back in. I missed
[9993.79s -> 10016.78s]  one. It's the first Manka. What are you talking about? We've made it all the way to Manka S.
[10017.42s -> 10029.24s]  He's got that, anything to say? Private Frisco on duty, sir. We can't train when the family is around.
[10029.88s -> 10050.08s]  I'm anything in, in direct reach. Not really. Uh, plug in. What is Manka S? Frog face going
[10050.08s -> 10064.08s]  fuck. The soldiers remind me of you because you look like an egg. Not even, not even close.
[10066.80s -> 10075.53s]  Not even, not even close. I mean, I'm talking not even 1% close. I couldn't be more incorrect.
[10075.53s -> 10087.37s]  Well, we're just talking facts here. All right, there's a photo. Free ranger's photo.
[10090.00s -> 10096.96s]  Um, I not get up here? Shit, I need like a springboard. There's definitely going to be a
[10096.96s -> 10119.88s]  springboard. There has to be. All right, let's go see what's going on. What's the matter? Pick me up.
[10120.68s -> 10135.12s]  Ribbit. Hello, bit. Jenny, what are you doing up? Go back to your room and go to sleep. Uh, Ribbo.
[10138.49s -> 10152.84s]  Night, Ribbit. Gibby Robo. What are you doing? Uh-huh. I see you're trying to reach the second
[10152.84s -> 10158.91s]  floor. But these stairs are a problem, aren't they? There's nothing here that you can use as a ladder.
[10159.63s -> 10164.22s]  Well, there are ways, but you'll need some special equipment. I'll look into it for you.
[10165.02s -> 10171.32s]  Goodbye. Do not leaving. You're just flying behind me. I know you're always there. It freaks me out.
[10172.12s -> 10186.54s]  Okay, back to the basement. Back to the basement. I want that, uh, that charger. He's the cameraman.
[10186.54s -> 10216.44s]  Yeah, it's like, uh, it's like Lucky 2. Ooh, wait, coins. How did I not get that? Nice. I want to push
[10216.44s -> 10231.96s]  this off. Free happy points. Take it. I have to pee. Um, we can take a bathroom break here. Just a
[10231.96s -> 10254.28s]  moment. Okay, now I'm ready to get the supercharger. Pee into your, what, pee into my streamer diaper?
[10254.28s -> 10274.17s]  You start advertising. Like, Nvidia starts making diapers for gamers. They're all branded. They're
[10274.17s -> 10285.02s]  black and green and shit. Play your foolish chatter. You're a cheatin' lion demon crab.
[10287.37s -> 10294.03s]  Cheating, how rude. You fail because your soul has not been properly cleansed. Who do you take
[10294.11s -> 10301.47s]  me for a brainless piece of kelp? I know you decide whether your eye opens or closes, ye filthy
[10301.47s -> 10308.22s]  bilge rat. That is untrue. A person with a pure soul would be able to see this clearly.
[10308.22s -> 10317.23s]  Me soul's as clean as the waters of shanty Pete's blessed harbor. Yar, one more time, ye scurvy scum.
[10321.10s -> 10329.00s]  There's no way the king of pirates is losing to some half-baked sea cucumber. Ooh, gambling
[10329.00s -> 10333.56s]  is the game and there's a casino here and yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Get on with it, you scallywag.
[10335.79s -> 10352.65s]  How frightening. Very well, I shall begin. Everything is nothing. Reach out with your soul,
[10352.65s -> 10370.01s]  feel, let it flow to my right eye. Will it open or will it remain closed? What do you feel? Will
[10370.01s -> 10380.89s]  it open? Yar, last time it was your portside peeper and the time before that starboard.
[10382.99s -> 10389.60s]  Yar, you shall open the eye, says I. Are you certain? Wait, he can just open it whenever he
[10389.60s -> 10401.44s]  wants. What certain as the tide do ebb and flow? It'll open, I tell you. You're with me, ain't you?
[10404.64s -> 10416.19s]  Yes, of course you are. Are you certain? Yar, me pirate's word is as good as me gold.
[10417.79s -> 10449.40s]  Very well. It opened. Yar, it opened, I tell you. Put it to your left eye.
[10450.04s -> 10459.42s]  Unfortunate. Don't play dumb, you miserable lifeboat leech. You're nothing but a liar and a thief.
[10459.42s -> 10469.40s]  There was a wink on screen already. Great pico, great cheeto is more like it. I'll have you
[10469.40s -> 10477.31s]  clapped in irons and kneel, keel-hauled. You're lucky I'm without me ship, you great blinkin'
[10477.31s -> 10494.33s]  sea slug. I've had me fill of you. Is there actually a wink? Alright, well, my turn. Another
[10494.33s -> 10506.84s]  sucker. I mean, oh, hear me, your soul is unclean. Will you cleanse your soul? Sure. Your desire to
[10506.84s -> 10516.09s]  achieve enlightenment is quite admirable. Moolah corrupts the soul. If you use your moolah, then
[10516.09s -> 10524.30s]  your soul is gradually purified. Now then, allow me to take your moolah as ablution for your dirty
[10524.38s -> 10531.37s]  soul. Alright, ten dollars. Let the cleansing begin. By repeating this process, your moolah
[10531.37s -> 10536.73s]  will be purified and returned to you in time. This is the one true way to abandon worldly desires
[10536.73s -> 10555.74s]  and become one with a higher plane. You have 1,628. How much would you like to purify? 100 bucks.
[10555.74s -> 10568.12s]  Let us begin the process of cleansing your moolah and your soul. Everything is nothing.
[10568.12s -> 10584.00s]  Entrapment is release. Abandonment is friendship. It worked. The cosmos embraces you with love.
[10586.25s -> 10596.41s]  Let your doubts and fears melt away. Doubt corrupts the soul. Release, release your moolah.
[10599.74s -> 10608.86s]  We return to a new beginning. Do not let your lack of experience make you nervous.
[10609.74s -> 10624.14s]  If you are nervous, then I too am nervous. Let us begin. Oh wanderer, preach with your soul.
[10624.70s -> 10636.03s]  Feel with your soul. Let your soul flow to my right eye. Will it open or will it remain shut?
[10641.44s -> 10653.93s]  One whose soul is clean will be able to see the answer with certainty. Well, will my eye open?
[10654.57s -> 10673.02s]  Okay, what if I say no and then shoot him in the eye? It'll have to be closed. No, it's not going
[10673.02s -> 10688.20s]  to open. You believe it will remain closed. Yes, I'm ready. Please do not be staring at me so much.
[10688.84s -> 10725.04s]  You will disrupt the cosmic balance. And now, closed. Closed! It's closed! Closed! You are
[10725.04s -> 10732.60s]  correct. Oh wait, those are the classic scam. Classic scam. You win one or two times in a row
[10732.60s -> 10738.73s]  and then the scam starts. And then you're like, holy shit, I just won 10, I won 100 bucks. I can
[10738.73s -> 10746.27s]  do that again and you do 500. And then the scam starts. And the women alike will rejoice in the
[10746.27s -> 10753.98s]  presence of your soul. You have gained 200 dollars. I should have went all in. Your noble intentions
[10753.98s -> 10759.20s]  and trusting soul have birthed a miracle. I must spread word of this miracle. I must share this
[10759.20s -> 10768.17s]  joy with others. Will you continue to cleanse? Nope. I'm out. See you later. Oh my, this is not
[10768.17s -> 10775.08s]  part of the plan. You're gonna stop? How unfortunate. Your mula and soul have been cleansed and now
[10775.08s -> 10781.18s]  are returned to you. Please come again. Whenever you are, close your eyes, please think of me.
[10782.06s -> 10802.51s]  See ya. Thanks for the 100 bucks. I am gonna save and I'm also gonna pee.
[10808.46s -> 10816.96s]  Trying to scam a Vegas man. Good luck. All right, I'll be right back. It's gonna be,
[10818.00s -> 10819.77s]  you can listen to this music in the meantime.
[11027.80s -> 11047.74s]  We love the music. It is pretty good. It's pretty good. It's got a nice little ring to it.
[11048.62s -> 11059.37s]  All right, let's go. All right, I'm, something's wrong with me. I thought that was a doorbell.
[11059.37s -> 11068.73s]  I thought that somebody rang the doorbell. That was like a perfect dodo. Okay, whatever. All right,
[11068.73s -> 11077.69s]  what was I doing? Oh yeah, getting the, the, I was getting the, the giga charger. Okay, up over.
[11077.69s -> 11088.12s]  Let's go chibi. I have a question. Why is nobody making me apologize for saying the word chibi?
[11088.12s -> 11105.80s]  You guys are okay with that one? You're okay with that one? That's fine. Okay.
[11111.00s -> 11123.77s]  Do I just climb the rope? I know. I can't see. I can't see. He's not kawaii robo.
[11124.17s -> 11150.43s]  Now I have to apologize. Now I have to apologize. I'm sorry. Now that crossed the line. Let's go over
[11150.43s -> 11167.84s]  here. And then get the giga charger. What? Wait, this box is everywhere. Can I not push these off?
[11167.84s -> 11185.60s]  How do I get this off? I can't push you off. I can push these ones off. Shit. All right. Um,
[11185.60s -> 11190.54s]  hold on. Not too much to do. Okay. I'm just going to get the charger.
[11194.49s -> 11214.72s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Just push it. I can't get them. What? Don't matter. Charge shot. Oh, okay.
[11221.95s -> 11245.31s]  Oh, this can soda. He can. Here it is. Let's see. Give me it.
[11245.31s -> 11255.80s]  Giga charger. Yes, that'd be it says I. If you don't play more visceral cleanup detail,
[11255.80s -> 11264.51s]  I'm refunding the game. Uh, all right. What does that have to do with me?
[11265.15s -> 11270.11s]  Do you truly mean to set giga robo to sale and once more? Yes, I do. Let's turn them back on.
[11270.99s -> 11287.15s]  Oh, chibi. You're such. Uh, I got one thing for you to remember. Don't use the outlets in the house
[11287.15s -> 11294.64s]  when you fill her up. You'll be drawn so much power. The poor Sandersons will go bankrupt,
[11295.20s -> 11307.12s]  causing the family hardship wouldn't sit well with giga robo. Ain't that right?
[11307.12s -> 11314.48s]  The giant can opener. This just sounds like a vomit sound effect. Somebody's just puking over
[11314.48s -> 11327.79s]  and over again. Your I almost forgot giga robo be missing a leg and no peg leg neither.
[11328.67s -> 11335.63s]  If memory serves, Captain Sanderson put it in a clear sort of treasure chest.
[11336.91s -> 11358.57s]  Sort of a steel trunk with a handle. Okay. Let's float down. Don't run out of battery.
[11377.39s -> 11396.43s]  Your energy is all. Are you going to save? All right, so I gotta go find his leg. Is that it?
[11396.43s -> 11439.47s]  I think it did everything I can do down here. I need a leg. My leg. You let an unauthorized
[11439.47s -> 11445.68s]  intruder walk straight through. Wait, what? What are you talking about? Didn't they just call me
[11445.68s -> 11453.64s]  an ally? You incompetent fools aren't fit for egg salad. You disgraced the free rangers. Don't I have
[11454.44s -> 11464.94s]  for after me? I'd say you should all be poached. Private Memphis would have been ashamed of you.
[11465.90s -> 11478.28s]  Okay. Private Detroit, wake up. Listen up. I'm gonna beat you eggs into a fearsome fighting omelet
[11478.84s -> 11486.25s]  and you'll thank me for it. Yes, sir. All right, soldiers, what are the five free ranger rules?
[11487.29s -> 11491.69s]  Free rangers rule number one. When Sarge gives an order, private say sir, yes, sir.
[11492.65s -> 11500.40s]  Rule number two. Leave no egg behind. Rule number three. Snooze on patrol, get thrown in the hole.
[11500.56s -> 11507.42s]  Rule number four. Show up for roll call or suffer the consequences. Rule number five.
[11508.14s -> 11515.28s]  Failure to follow orders is punishable by scrambling. All right, never forget the five rules.
[11516.08s -> 11541.00s]  Together we will defeat Tau. Go. Text Frisco, begin roll call. Yes, sir. All right. Um, kitchen.
[11541.00s -> 11547.80s]  Should I? Where do I want to go? I can't go up to the second floor. What do I have?
[11549.24s -> 11557.00s]  I wonder if I should go over here. Save the frog. Save the frog. Save the frog. Should I just,
[11557.00s -> 11579.36s]  I mean, can I talk? Save the frog. I need water. Are you the robot that breached our perimeter?
[11579.92s -> 11596.12s]  No. Roger, I've got nothing else to say to you. I think I want to go up. Can I go up?
[11601.23s -> 11610.25s]  There's nothing over there. I can't really do anything. Red block. Can I climb something? I
[11610.25s -> 11623.58s]  don't think so. Wait, can I climb that? Say yes. Why would I do that? Why would I say yes?
[11624.30s -> 11628.78s]  Aren't they looking? They're trying to kill me. Are you the robot that breached the perimeter?
[11628.78s -> 11636.49s]  I should. Oh, yes, I am. Then they're gonna start firing at it. He'd be a depth charge and call it
[11636.49s -> 11648.06s]  a biscuit. Very impressive. Not bad for a pencil neck robot. Just don't let it go. I'm getting,
[11648.06s -> 11653.84s]  I'm getting Tasmanian devil vibes from this guy right now. Don't let it go to your scrap metal
[11653.84s -> 11664.80s]  head. You aren't half the robot that giga-robo was. Not even half of the half of the robot or
[11664.80s -> 11676.30s]  half of that. Do a Tasmanian devil impression? I don't, you, okay. There is no Tasmanian devil
[11676.30s -> 11685.61s]  impression unless you go all fucking in. And I'm, I don't know if I'm prepared to go all in. A non
[11685.61s -> 11693.53s]  all in impression of Tasmanian devil is bad. And it's gonna be like, duh, that wasn't, come on man,
[11693.53s -> 11707.60s]  that sucked. Oh, that was a little, you gotta go fucking all in. Otherwise it's, I'm not, I don't
[11707.60s -> 11715.48s]  think I, I don't know if I'm prepared to go all in right now. It's like, it's fucking a hundred percent
[11715.48s -> 11731.16s]  all in. Otherwise it's not gonna, I'm not thinking I can go all in. I tried, I tried. I was close.
[11731.24s -> 11752.01s]  I got, I was close. You can't, you have to go. You have to be standing and have your arms in the
[11752.01s -> 11765.26s]  air and fucking go nuts. Otherwise it's bad. And I fucked it up because I didn't even end it with the
[11766.14s -> 11777.47s]  so it's, I couldn't do it. I'm going fuck, you want to go all in? I'll go all in. I gotta stand up.
[11782.01s -> 11799.95s]  Okay, I don't have like any close neighbors.
[11806.70s -> 11810.38s]  That's not even, I don't even know what that sound would be. That's like, I'm in,
[11810.38s -> 11832.01s]  I just got thrown into like a blender. Like what's going on? Outlast? What do you mean outlast?
[11837.32s -> 11849.48s]  Wink? I would never do that on camera. Doing a Tasmanian devil impression on camera. No way.
[11850.12s -> 11853.08s]  No way. That would be, the word I'm looking for is embarrassing.
[11853.96s -> 11861.79s]  An all in Tasmanian devil is impressive. Otherwise it's embarrassing. And there's a very
[11861.79s -> 11879.90s]  fine fucking line. I'm not even sure I hit it. All right, what do I need to do? It was on the mark.
[11881.90s -> 11900.76s]  I need water. Wait, I haven't been up there. Green screen request is to do that on, oh my god.
[11900.76s -> 11910.24s]  That would be so fucking funny. I already see, I can already see the edits of me spinning around
[11910.24s -> 11914.48s]  and doing that and it being in like Looney Tunes cartoons. All right, yeah, put it on,
[11914.48s -> 11922.59s]  get it on the recommendation when I finally fucking do that. I'll spin around and shit. Oh,
[11922.59s -> 11956.97s]  that'd be so stupid. I can't, can I make it? I need, can I climb up here? I need water. Water.
[11956.97s -> 11966.81s]  I can actually, I can do it from here. I should be able to do it from here, right? All the way to
[11966.81s -> 11993.16s]  the top. Get on the table. Drink. Okay. Pretty good. All right, so from here I should be able
[11993.16s -> 12006.01s]  to do it from here, right? Oh no, I'm almost out of time. Way to go. Call it a day.
[12006.01s -> 12012.27s]  Okay.
[12018.03s -> 12020.46s]  Remember, that was the poison cup.
[12023.72s -> 12032.14s]  Somebody came in here and poisoned it. Oh, 700.
[12036.70s -> 12049.08s]  I think I can buy another upgrade too. Now just take out the Giga charger you're carrying with you.
[12051.58s -> 12055.02s]  That's it. Look at that. It's already bigger than you are, Achieb. I know, everything's bigger than
[12055.02s -> 12066.44s]  me. Let me guess, I have to pay money to fill this?
[12082.03s -> 12094.11s]  Okay, let's, let's check it out. What's the, what's the deal? What does it take?
[12099.37s -> 12101.85s]  Looks like the Giga battery doesn't have any energy stored up at all.
[12103.13s -> 12105.53s]  Gonna take a whole lot of juice to charge that battery.
[12106.49s -> 12109.77s]  I can't charge it from the outlets in the house. That would break the family's bank.
[12111.45s -> 12117.53s]  Well, I, I'm getting paid from the family. So the more work, if I do extra work and get paid more
[12117.53s -> 12127.60s]  money, it is their money. If I want to charge it. Um, sure. Thousand kilowatts equals a thousand
[12127.60s -> 12144.09s]  dollars. How many kilowatts will you charge? Thousand. Well, that's not very much. More,
[12144.09s -> 12167.80s]  Chibi-Robo, more. I'm gonna get a nectar flower seed. Okay, I have, where do I plant the flowers?
[12172.06s -> 12183.44s]  More, Chibi-Robo, more. Sorry about that, my bad. Don't be sorry. Just don't do it anymore.
[12183.92s -> 12192.84s]  All right. We need water for the frog outside. Back to the kitchen. I talked to the little girl
[12192.84s -> 12202.75s]  again. Let's talk to the girl. Anything else for us to do with the girl? Oh, she's drawing a picture
[12202.75s -> 12222.35s]  of me. Ribbit, gimme ribbit. Gimme, gimme what? Oh, gimme. Gimmie the little girl. I got no water.
[12223.68s -> 12250.20s]  Oh, gimme. Give the little girl a gunpowder. Frog ring? You want this? Thanks, Ribbit.
[12253.80s -> 12268.36s]  Sixty-six happy points. Holy shit. Do it again? Eight more, Ribbit. Okay, here. Let's, oh no,
[12268.36s -> 12280.14s]  I'll give you another present. She's demanding them. Thank you. Eight more. All right. Uh,
[12280.94s -> 12293.44s]  we need to go to the kitchen. Oh, did I give both? Maybe I gave both.
[12303.85s -> 12308.01s]  We haven't even tested if this has synced up or not. It's been like three and a half hours.
[12308.01s -> 12325.48s]  We need to do that. Ready? Bum, bum, bum, bum. Are we good? Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[12325.48s -> 12342.22s]  All right, good. Bosh up, bosh up. Crazy into, crazy into you. Now you guys are making me do it.
[12342.86s -> 12350.84s]  Chibi-Robo already? One day shipped memory card? Hey, when I tell you I'm gonna make something
[12350.84s -> 12360.67s]  happen, I'm gonna make it happen. Bum. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, bum. Say, Chibo, you saw Jenny, right?
[12361.31s -> 12366.28s]  Yes, I did. Don't you think she looks weird? I mean, she thinks she's a frog.
[12368.52s -> 12383.16s]  Uh, she's just a kid having fun. No, she just, she just, she's just a frog. She's a kid. She's
[12383.16s -> 12387.48s]  like two. One day she just started saying Ribbit and nothing else. I don't know what happened.
[12388.83s -> 12394.43s]  I know, I live with freaks. Holy shit, mom. Would you like to chat with me for a bit? Yeah, sure.
[12396.67s -> 12401.74s]  Oh, you're well made. Now that the water is boiling, let's have tea.
[12404.97s -> 12423.12s]  Since you're so small, you can sit over here. Okay. B-movie? That's what I was thinking too.
[12423.84s -> 12434.32s]  Oh, do you see my husband sleeping on the sofa? Lazy, no good, so-and-so.
[12439.42s -> 12447.77s]  Mm, that's right. Sure. But you think I'm too harsh? It was his fault. He bought you without
[12447.77s -> 12453.66s]  even asking me. He's between jobs right now, and yet he spends moolah like crazy. He's a slacker
[12453.66s -> 12468.89s]  and a bum. Uh, I mean, we're having tea. We're like-you're venting. Should I-is this like a
[12469.53s -> 12477.64s]  no? Yeah, yeah. Or is this like a no, no? No, he's just, he's just between jobs. Oh, I'm sorry.
[12477.64s -> 12486.04s]  It's not fair for me to go off on you like that. You know, tea always tastes better when you have
[12486.04s -> 12502.91s]  someone to talk to. Thank you, Chibo. 13 happy points. That's it? I mean, someone who says
[12502.91s -> 12511.87s]  something other than ribbit. Maybe I made it a little too strong. I think this tea is too
[12511.87s -> 12522.33s]  bitter. Oh, very nice. You've been cleaning up the house. Thank you, Chibo. I think mom needs to go
[12522.33s -> 12538.54s]  on vacation. Oh, my little teacup. Can I drink it? Sugar? Oh, you want sugar? You'll stuff anything
[12538.54s -> 12548.33s]  in your head, won't you? You want some sugar? Sugar cube. Oh, you want some? Uh, I'll get that.
[12548.33s -> 12556.54s]  Let me get that for you. Oh, cookies! Yes, those are delicious, but they'll make you fat if you eat
[12556.54s -> 12568.00s]  too many. Mom, can you stop being the ultimate buzzkill? Oh, that? Yes, those are all bills.
[12568.88s -> 12574.62s]  My husband is constantly blowing all our moolah on his stupid toys. People are supposed to grow out
[12574.62s -> 12583.82s]  of toys. Sooner or later, at least normal people are. If you put that in the garbage can, it would
[12583.82s -> 12596.60s]  be a big help. I bet Jenny would really like that. I know she would, because I actually talk to your
[12596.60s -> 12607.79s]  daughter. One of these days, I'm going to sell all his toys at a garage sale or just throw them out.
[12608.51s -> 12629.47s]  Can I do anything else? No? Okay, I got everything on the table. You gotta clean up your cookie
[12629.47s -> 12637.45s]  crumbs, though. I got this. Don't worry, Mrs. Sanderson. I bet the goldfish will eat it. Yep,
[12637.45s -> 12647.00s]  make her tea sweet. Hey, Chibo, did you bring me a sugar cube? Yes, I did. I'm here to serve.
[12647.64s -> 12666.56s]  Gunpowder. No, I'm not going to poison her. I want the happy points. I'm trying to save money to
[12666.56s -> 12681.76s]  bring back Giga Chad or whatever his name is. How thoughtful of you. You got $36. Spread the
[12681.76s -> 12687.13s]  happiness. And his dad still watches space hunter Drake Redcrest. It's like living with an infant.
[12688.33s -> 12690.97s]  I mean, he's an adult. Don't you think there's something wrong with him?
[12693.37s -> 12705.04s]  I'm not a marriage counselor. Okay, let me answer this truthfully. On one hand,
[12705.68s -> 12713.55s]  he's spending all their money on toys. They got bills to pay. It's pretty irresponsible. I mean,
[12713.55s -> 12720.22s]  that's like, what the fuck are you doing? On the other hand, probably six months ago, I watched the
[12720.22s -> 12742.59s]  entire first season of Spongebob. Just in bed. So this is a tough one for me. Now he's projecting.
[12744.03s -> 12749.71s]  Let her vent. All right, vent. Yes. Yes. Come on. What's he doing? He buys all these. You're very
[12749.71s -> 12754.99s]  understanding. Our upstairs bedroom is crammed full of that pathetic Drake Redcrest junk.
[12756.19s -> 12761.23s]  Say, how do you reach high places when you're such a little guy? I bet that chibi robo manual
[12761.23s -> 12769.15s]  that Jenny's dad got would say something about that. Oh, no, it's bitter. I forgot to stir it.
[12769.95s -> 12781.98s]  Let's see something to stir with something to stir with. Wow, that's a kid's spoon, isn't it?
[12783.10s -> 12788.30s]  I bet you could use that as a shovel. Isn't there a spoon around here somewhere?
[12791.74s -> 12809.12s]  I got it. I got this. I got this. Where was it? I got this spoon. Where was it? Spoon. All right,
[12809.12s -> 12830.68s]  I got this. It's up there. How do I get up there? I can't. I remember I couldn't climb that.
[12833.87s -> 12840.30s]  All right, I'm going to just jump. There's I there's no jump in this game. You can't reach it.
[12841.02s -> 12844.48s]  There's no reaching it. You can't reach it yet. There's no you can't reach it. There's no reaching
[12844.48s -> 12872.57s]  it. Well, I guess I should get back to work. Well, okay. Back to the grind. I'm going to feed the
[12872.57s -> 12886.80s]  goldfish again because mom won't do it. Can I help with the dishes? Can I fill the mug? Yes,
[12886.80s -> 12904.33s]  I want to give the fish a crumb, cookie crumb. I'm going to give the fish gunpowder.
[12905.53s -> 12914.99s]  Okay, can I fill the mug with water? You're so kind, Chibo. I should have married you instead
[12914.99s -> 12945.76s]  of that slob. I just nodded my head. All right, give me water. Mug, water, fill it. Mom, you missed
[12945.76s -> 12961.05s]  a dish. Just kidding. It's me. Jenny's dad. Jenny and Taro are such slobs. We have garbage
[12961.05s -> 12965.37s]  and stains everywhere. I love it when you help out. It saves me a lot of trouble.
[12966.33s -> 12979.04s]  I'll make sure to give Telly your moolah bonus. All right. Jenny's dad. Not even addressing him
[12979.04s -> 13010.70s]  by his name. Jenny's dad. No, I won't. Okay, we're good. God, their marriage is over. Jesus.
[13016.59s -> 13028.17s]  All right, I need to get up here. What is this? Yeah, those are deadlines from bill collectors.
[13028.17s -> 13036.76s]  We're pretty far behind. This is bad. This is bad. All right. Yeah, I'm on mom's side.
[13037.56s -> 13050.09s]  I'm on mom's side. Wait, can I plant? Hold on. Don't I have seeds? Can I plant them here?
[13051.29s -> 13073.44s]  Oh, I need to shovel. Yeah, okay. What do we got? I need the spoon. Can't get up there from here.
[13074.40s -> 13080.88s]  What about this way? I can't. How do I get up there? See, I'm saying like there's no reliable
[13080.88s -> 13089.96s]  way. Maybe if I can, I get on the fish tank and climb up on that thing. I can't climb this.
[13090.52s -> 13095.96s]  This would be the way that I would say you would do it. Can't float from here. Can I?
[13096.84s -> 13106.68s]  Cannot climb these bottles. That seems strange. I feel like I should be able to.
[13107.48s -> 13137.63s]  The game cube on the shelf? Is there? Where? There's no game cube. All right, I can't really
[13137.63s -> 13154.59s]  do anything. I need water. I can't fill the mug. Can't get from here. Turn around, you fool.
[13155.47s -> 13188.96s]  Is there anything else I can do with mom? Mom, help. I fell in the drain. Turn the garbage
[13188.96s -> 13205.76s]  disposal on. I don't think that's going to help me. Wait, the water. Tea. Can I get water from the
[13206.72s -> 13213.92s]  cup? The tea thing here? I can get water from this, right? Water. Is water in here? No. Oh, cans.
[13214.56s -> 13234.41s]  That's it. I can climb this. Chibi, you can't climb this. It's perfect. It's exactly what you
[13234.41s -> 13252.09s]  need to do. Oh, crumbs. Get the fish. Climb up on the ladder. That's not a bad idea. Not a bad idea.
[13257.72s -> 13262.36s]  Up there. I know you can get up there. I've gone up there before.
[13263.32s -> 13286.17s]  Chibi. Oh, it's this side. Can I climb this? Oh, I can. This is where the grease is in the fan.
[13288.76s -> 13344.08s]  What are you doing up here? What the hell is he doing up here? Why is this wrong? The families
[13345.08s -> 13369.31s]  here. I can't let them see me. Aha. You have tone up me. I simply got have misunderstanding.

[13825.04s -> 13827.44s]  Don't freak me out like that. I got a Halloween costume.

[13876.38s -> 13893.60s]  contract when you get to top 200. So what's the pose? It's scary? I wonder what that does.

[13952.88s -> 13983.72s]  you know, like my wife does. Man, that's pretty cute, Chibi-Robo. That's it. Boomer humor. I'm

[13995.82s -> 14011.29s]  I got enough. Let's go. New battery. Battery, battery, battery. More battery. More battery.
[14020.51s -> 14025.71s]  Get to go out. I think Otto needs to go out. He's giving me the take me out look.
[14036.38s -> 14046.00s]  How much more battery do I get? And upgrade happy points.
[14047.76s -> 14058.92s]  Your Chibi ranking has gone. I'm in the top 100. Bonus battery.
[14063.16s -> 14068.04s]  160. Very, very useful. 99.
[14071.61s -> 14073.69s]  Okay, I need 472 happy points.
[14074.65s -> 14088.84s]  What if I get this scrap metal? No, I'm trying to pick up the trash.
[14096.00s -> 14112.62s]  I want the trash. No, trash. Sorry about that, my bad. Yeah, well, I mean, you've messed
[14112.62s -> 14125.00s]  enough the whole house. Talk to dad in a normal outfit. Will that work? All right,
[14125.00s -> 14132.51s]  hold on. I gotta take Otto out in a second. You wanna go outside? Okay. I'm gonna take a little
[14132.51s -> 14141.44s]  break and let Mr. Otto outside. All right, dad, what can you tell me? Something to tell me?
[14142.48s -> 14146.32s]  Hope you make it to number one in the Chibi-Robo ranking. Oh, by the way,
[14147.44s -> 14150.48s]  did you pick up my garbage? Thanks, Chibi-Robo. You're a pal.
[14157.77s -> 14160.17s]  Dad. All right, what can I look at? Is it in the manual?
[14161.37s -> 14176.08s]  Is it worth it to buy an automaton? Yes. Utilibots. Chibi-Robo is very eco-conscious,
[14176.08s -> 14180.48s]  and so one of its primary functions is to collect scrap from around your house and recycle it.
[14182.16s -> 14185.84s]  While you will not see the scrap being recycled in Utilibots, please be sure that they are
[14185.84s -> 14191.68s]  constructed in an environmentally friendly manner. Wait, recycled products inside the
[14191.68s -> 14200.54s]  Recycled Lotron Chibi House. Should I be putting my trash in there? Platters, warps, bridges.
[14202.56s -> 14210.09s]  Studying hard. Got any metal? All right, changing suits. Let's just skip this to get free points.
[14210.97s -> 14219.58s]  Read the whole thing. Scrap is different from trash, okay?
[14220.38s -> 14235.66s]  Ah, I'm wrong. Skipping lore. We already know this. It's like 20 or 30 free points. Bonus batteries.
[14246.60s -> 14258.83s]  Auto has to shit. Now, he's fine. I'll leave. All right, let's go, Auto. You ready? He's like,
[14258.83s -> 14265.12s]  yes, I am. He's just rolling around. He's ready to go. All right, I'll be right back. Give me like,
[14265.12s -> 14580.96s]  I don't know, three minutes, three, four. I don't know. He might have to poop. Okay, I've returned.
[14586.04s -> 14606.08s]  Let's go. Bacon should be banned. The food? I don't know what that means. All right, so
[14607.84s -> 14620.43s]  almost time to have the day end. I still can't get up the stairs. How do I get up the stairs?
[14621.15s -> 14633.71s]  I think I need to buy something. Oh, wait, I'm gonna give the frog ring. I have a ring for you.
[14638.08s -> 14662.33s]  Give me. Yes. Can I get a cookie too? 33 happy points. Seven more. Do you want a cookie?
[14664.35s -> 14682.86s]  Ribbit, ribbit? No. All right. Boyer backyard kitchen. What's the current task? I have to
[14682.86s -> 14687.90s]  get the frog water. I have to fix their marriage. I need to get the spoon.
[14689.10s -> 14697.82s]  Let me talk to dad with the red. What about the Red Crest guy?
[14703.34s -> 14715.29s]  Easy. Yeah, that should be easy. Hey, look. Wow. A space hunter Drake Red Crest costume.
[14716.25s -> 14727.40s]  Good gravy. That is so cool. I want one. I want one. I want one. I
[14727.96s -> 14744.78s]  want one. Oh, let me see you pose. Come on. Let me see. Am I enabling dad to buy an expensive
[14744.78s -> 14765.55s]  cosplay outfit? Nine happy points from dad. That's it. It's a shame my wife can't understand just how
[14765.55s -> 14786.08s]  cool he is. Okay, maybe he is a bit weird. For a break, chibi robo. He pogged his pants.
[14786.08s -> 14813.05s]  That's great work out there. 84. I'm climbing. What's the gunpowder for? I got money. I got
[14813.05s -> 14829.63s]  money. What can I buy to help me from a suit? Another battery range chip. What's a hot rod?
[14830.35s -> 14842.91s]  A popular car among racers. Perhaps you will race one day. You can buy a car. It's a full
[14842.91s -> 14866.52s]  letter grid. I'm saving for the car. Yeah. What's going on? Did you hear that?
[14869.15s -> 14884.48s]  I'm scraping my ears. It came from outside. Wink. All right. It's just Mr. Red Crest
[14884.48s -> 14902.12s]  stomping around. What do you think that noise was? Frog ring? Blood? Wait a second. What's that?
[14902.84s -> 14923.56s]  Is that oil? Why is there oil in here? Investigate. Yep, that's oil. All right. I wonder where it
[14923.56s -> 14936.20s]  came from. Huh. From above. It's dripping from. Oh, it's just dripping from dad's fingers.
[14938.54s -> 14952.30s]  Uh oh. It's spider bot. Those are the things from the news. The spiders are here. Uh oh.
[14953.63s -> 14967.12s]  I know this move. It's the enemy spider circle. Spider roulette. This is going to be bad. Really
[14967.12s -> 14986.04s]  bad. Quick. Get the chibi blaster. Did I leave the oven on? Oh, scrap. That's what I think it is.
[14986.04s -> 14992.52s]  It's scrap. Yes. Collect enough of that and you can build a utility bot with the recyclatron.
[14993.24s -> 14997.04s]  Spiders are good for something after all. They're good for recycling. Tee hee hee.
[14998.00s -> 15010.60s]  I have enough to build a ladder. Kind of clean up their fucking mess.
[15011.24s -> 15031.79s]  That was brutal. That was pretty cool. All right. Here we go. Let's make the ladder. I have 300.
[15032.35s -> 15055.04s]  I missed a spot. Kind of cleaning robot, am I? Let's do it.
[15058.16s -> 15062.67s]  Okay. Chibi manual. Something to say about utility bots. Yeah, I know.
[15063.63s -> 15071.90s]  Welcome to the chibi pc. Recyclatron. All right. Living room ladder. A ladder that reaches high
[15071.90s -> 15087.10s]  places placed near the chibi robot house. Build it. Put your scrap into the recyclatron. Nice.
[15091.88s -> 15102.96s]  And what is it? Something came out. Set it out in the living room. I can finally reach high places.
[15104.54s -> 15120.17s]  Very cool. Where'd it go? Underneath that big big present sheet. Congratulations on building
[15120.17s -> 15125.96s]  the utility bot. Tee hee. I feel like we got a new partner. I'm so happy.
[15128.12s -> 15139.47s]  Abnormal activity detected while on patrol. Uh oh. Space hunter drake redcrest. Alert. Alert.
[15142.19s -> 15153.96s]  What have we here? Now chibi robot, are you ready? Yes. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to the
[15153.96s -> 15172.99s]  newest member of the family. Ladder guy. Hey, it's me ladder guy. How are you? I'm so happy
[15172.99s -> 15183.61s]  to be part of the family. All right, come on. This nifty ladder utility bot will let you do all
[15183.61s -> 15191.72s]  sorts of things. Push or pull it in addition to raising it up and down. Isn't that something? It
[15191.72s -> 15199.98s]  talks, right? Drake redcrest is confused and angry, but it does not appear to be evil.
[15201.10s -> 15206.86s]  In addition to normal, situation peaceful. The patrol must continue.
[15207.82s -> 15216.81s]  Well, keep up the good work. Thank you. We can reach the high parts of the house, chibi robot.
[15217.53s -> 15221.36s]  I have no mouth and must scream and cannot scream.
[15224.00s -> 15233.26s]  I present to you my new song. Are you ready to be amazed? Sure. I, television, will now enthrall you
[15233.26s -> 15252.92s]  with the gift of song. This one is called teriyaki blues. I see somebody spent 20 minutes in garage
[15252.92s -> 15279.71s]  band as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't cry on the new
[15279.71s -> 15291.82s]  equipment. I've heard you've been interrupted by a malfunction of some kind. I'm sorry you couldn't
[15291.82s -> 15309.07s]  hear the whole song. Thanks. Anyway, you were a great audience. Okay. What do you got to say?
[15309.07s -> 15313.71s]  Well, now that that's out of the way, press eight next to me and I'll lift it up. Press left and
[15313.71s -> 15328.88s]  right. I'll move left and right. Right? Come on. We need it. Let's hear it. Start your plug to raise
[15328.88s -> 15333.72s]  the ladder. If you want to lower it, tilt down. Change the ladder's direction. Plug yourself into
[15333.72s -> 15344.59s]  a different side. You can push or pull freely so drive moving. Okay. Okay. I get you. How far does
[15344.59s -> 15356.81s]  this go? Holy shit. This takes a lot of power. We're just gonna just let it go the whole thing.
[15357.53s -> 15374.27s]  I'll be back. You're gonna die. Yeah, that was close. Your energy is full. Would you like to save?
[15374.27s -> 15388.04s]  No. You're making them bankrupt. Blame dad. I'm doing my best. I'm just gonna climb it.
[15388.20s -> 15403.56s]  But still no memory card. Now it's okay though. We've been on it for four and a half hours or so.
[15403.56s -> 15412.99s]  It'll be fine. All right. We're going from here to there. Oh, look at that. That's so sad.
[15413.71s -> 15442.06s]  All right. Let's do it. I'll go this way. That way. One coin in here. What am I gonna take this from
[15442.06s -> 15447.58s]  now? All right. We can go up there. We're going up here. We're getting that frog ring. I love this
[15447.58s -> 15468.99s]  game. This is a fun game. Oh, shit. I can. Oh, it's very cozy. Yeah. It's just very nice. It's
[15468.99s -> 15475.92s]  very nice. It's not a whole lot of like stress or anything. It's just fun. Who doesn't love
[15475.92s -> 15484.64s]  Chibi-Robo? I don't know. I don't know who wouldn't. It seems hard to not like it. All right. Let's move
[15484.64s -> 15489.92s]  this this way. No, no. Wait. I'm assuming it has to be on the right. The plug has to be in the side
[15489.92s -> 15506.84s]  that you want to move. Wait, am I in the way? How do I move it though? Can I wait? Can I just push it?
[15508.04s -> 15521.95s]  You just push it. You do? No, you don't. Oh, you do? Okay. I was freaking out. That's how you tilt it.
[15523.53s -> 15536.36s]  It hurts. All right. We're going up. Nintendo hates it, apparently. Yeah. Nintendo did this thing
[15536.36s -> 15541.10s]  where they really, really, really, for some reason, want you to really like Toad because
[15541.74s -> 15545.02s]  they have all these cool characters and all these interesting franchises, but
[15545.02s -> 15555.63s]  like, please like Toad. What's wrong with Toad? You want to go over the things that are wrong with
[15555.63s -> 15574.67s]  Toad? I don't know if I want to do this. No, not in the same stream. You just spread this out.
[15575.47s -> 15581.76s]  You got to spread these out. I can't tell you that I don't like Zelda and that Toad is dumb in the
[15581.76s -> 15586.72s]  same stream. If I do that, I'm going to lose like 50,000 subs. So we have to spread this out over
[15586.72s -> 15609.52s]  the course of like 10 months. One controversy per year, Jeremy. One controversy a year. The plug-up
[15609.52s -> 15620.94s]  here. Oh, dude. 10 community subs from Desoid. The reverse happened. Hating Toad is not controversial.
[15623.92s -> 15629.84s]  I don't hate Toad. I just, I mean, there's other games they could make besides Toad's like
[15629.84s -> 15636.28s]  Treasure Tracker. There's like three of them. How many Toad Treasure Tracker games are there?
[15636.92s -> 15646.88s]  That game's great. Now imagine. No, hold on. That game's good, right? That game gets a good game.
[15646.88s -> 15660.17s]  Wait, what if Toad Treasure Tracker was Chibi-Robo 2? Think about that. Chibi-Robo isn't by Nintendo.
[15660.17s -> 15673.16s]  Chibi-Robo 2 exists. Oh, yeah, but it's on the DS, right? It's not the name. Oh, fuck. I'm on
[15673.16s -> 15680.17s]  battery. I'm on a set of battery here. We are dangerously low on battery. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[15680.17s -> 15690.62s]  Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna die. There's a plug right here, right?
[15690.62s -> 15707.85s]  There's a Japanese-only DS sequel that plays like the original and is a direct story continuation.
[15709.58s -> 15717.39s]  Why? Okay, what is with, why don't they think Western audiences like this? I don't get it.
[15718.19s -> 15724.24s]  This is, why wouldn't they? Why would it not come out in America and in Europe and stuff?
[15724.96s -> 15743.72s]  Because of translations. It's because they lose money on a translation.
[15748.96s -> 15753.87s]  Um, is this high enough? I think I have to go down. Can I go any higher?
[15755.39s -> 15758.27s]  I don't think I can. No, I'm gonna have to go back down.
[15763.90s -> 15778.86s]  It's also localization. American-only. I want gun, burger, and car. What are you talking about?
[15779.82s -> 15795.66s]  That's as high as it goes? Come on. All right, let's move it down here because I want to get
[15795.66s -> 15810.25s]  up to there, up there. All right. Can I like retract the club? Club, the plug.
[15810.97s -> 15818.84s]  Do you guys understand how fucked up my brain is? I just said plug backwards, essentially.
[15830.80s -> 15862.62s]  Gulp. The plug. Too high. Too high. Too high. I'm so fucked up, man. Relax. Drink some water.
[15862.62s -> 15879.68s]  Oh, man. I'm so fucked up. I don't even know, man. What was the point of coming up here this high?
[15880.92s -> 15889.52s]  Hmm. Demon door right there. Ooh, demon door. And another way to go. Ooh, can I climb up this?
[15894.92s -> 15904.14s]  Shit. All right. There's nothing up here. Just a plug. Wait. Weed, dude. Weed, weed, weed, weed,
[15904.22s -> 15937.16s]  pog, weed, dude. Weed, pog. Can I open this? Ooh, happy point. Okay, so from here, can I do anything
[15937.16s -> 15956.91s]  else? I guess I can go down a little. Dude, epicness. Epicness. Epicness. Demon door? Yeah,
[15956.91s -> 15960.75s]  I've already gotten it. There's a demon door back here. I have to push this back.
[15962.86s -> 15986.86s]  So much to explore. We're going up to the telephone. Sure, you just won the internet.
[15989.08s -> 16021.05s]  Whatever. Oh, can I use the phone? Thank you for the gold. You know, I didn't know what the
[16021.05s -> 16044.88s]  hell that did or what it meant or what it was until seven or eight months ago. There's a ring
[16044.88s -> 16048.33s]  up there. There's a plug up there, too. All right, I'm going to move this back again. We're going to
[16048.33s -> 16058.24s]  go here. Can I reach this? Nothing on this side of the phone. Can I climb? I can't climb that. What?
[16058.24s -> 16077.80s]  Uh, remember, say three. Three. Who cares? Why don't you stream on Reddit?
[16081.79s -> 16097.02s]  Reddit live. Holy crap, two golds. This blew up. I don't, I still don't even get what it means.
[16100.72s -> 16107.20s]  So, okay, I want to repeat this so I can make sure I get this right. Stop throwing shit at me.
[16110.97s -> 16117.61s]  So, Reddit has a system where you upvote stuff. So, okay, let's say somebody makes a comment
[16117.69s -> 16121.05s]  and that comment, people, a lot of people agree with it and they, a hundred people press the
[16121.05s -> 16127.21s]  button to go up. Yeah, and that's one of the top kind of comments, top posts, right? So, somebody
[16127.21s -> 16135.05s]  can pay money to put a stamp on that post, right? And that just, that's it. It's just somebody
[16135.05s -> 16141.53s]  decided to be like, holy shit, I loved what you said so much that I paid 44 cents for it, right?
[16141.53s -> 16150.09s]  Or something like 20, a dollar or something, right? Is that what it means? And then they get
[16150.09s -> 16167.87s]  some website perks, okay? It's five dollars. All right, so it's five dollars, okay? And then
[16167.87s -> 16173.15s]  how long does that last? So, let's say I wrote something on a thread and I got, I got gold.
[16173.15s -> 16177.31s]  Somebody was like, holy, well, dude, I don't know who it was, but thanks. How long do I get gold
[16177.31s -> 16202.51s]  status for? Wait, the TV shows a month. Can I do something with the TV right now? But it doesn't
[16202.51s -> 16217.80s]  do anything. You get paid, you get, it's a, to browse Reddit ad free. Can I put this up to press
[16217.80s -> 16243.16s]  the button or something? Well, here we are. Let's go. Let's go. Nothing on TV. What the fuck?
[16243.88s -> 16292.76s]  Nothing on fucking TV. What the hell? Well, okay. Go inside the TV. What do I get in the TV? Remember,
[16292.76s -> 16297.08s]  you're about to get 10 million views. Already got it. We already got it like a couple hours
[16297.08s -> 16310.24s]  ago and it was crazy. I popped a bottle of champagne. It was nuts. I still need to get over
[16310.24s -> 16318.99s]  here. Hold on. Turn this around. Can I make the platform just be here so I can? All right. Now
[16318.99s -> 16343.79s]  bring it down. There's a hole in that wall over there. Whoa. Burn it up. I can probably blast that
[16343.79s -> 16369.48s]  wall. Let's get it closer. All right. Let's get it down here and yeah, that's it. Let's go. Yep.
[16371.12s -> 16374.88s]  No, I don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. I don't want
[16374.88s -> 16387.60s]  to go to bed. So anyways, um, Reddit, they pay Reddit gold to somebody and they get some perks
[16387.60s -> 16405.05s]  for the website and they know who, but they don't know who it was. So anyways, Reddit, rank 80.
[16405.69s -> 16434.20s]  Get off Reddit and go to bed. That's why they say thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Let's see.
[16435.16s -> 16454.65s]  Whoa. Pretty cool. Thank you, kind sir. Thank you for the gift sub, kind stranger. Thank you for
[16454.65s -> 16492.89s]  the gift sub, kind stranger. Boom. And brought coin. Thanks for the wink, kind stranger. Yeah,
[16492.89s -> 16498.35s]  whatever. Yeah, whatever. All right. Let's get on top of the chair.
[16505.88s -> 16511.96s]  And then we're going to go over there. There's a lot of places to go with this.
[16512.68s -> 16529.92s]  Real wink. Let me check. Let me verify it. Okay. It was real. My eyes are so red. I don't know why.
[16530.64s -> 16556.44s]  I can climb this shit. Clean the trash up here. How come some people get full face cam winks and
[16556.44s -> 16563.34s]  other people only get a tiny window of a wink? It's the same thing. See, it's the same thing.
[16563.34s -> 16582.27s]  All right. 50 cents. Reddit silver versus Reddit gold. You guys are fucking crazy.
[16584.27s -> 16593.82s]  All right. Have I gotten everything in here? All the demon doors and everything.
[16599.18s -> 16606.32s]  Pouch behind dad's head. Demon door up there. Next to the clock. We haven't gone over there yet.
[16606.96s -> 16612.56s]  What about on the table? I haven't been on the table. How have I not been on the table?
[16613.28s -> 16627.39s]  That seems absurd, right? That's absurd. It's a full screen wink for 150 million dollars.
[16628.35s -> 16652.52s]  All right, dad. Oh, he's running out of power. Plug into dad's head.
[16663.93s -> 16667.56s]  You didn't even give me my wink. You turned the camera on and said,
[16668.28s -> 16673.21s]  if you get a wink. Nope. And then end of the stream. I was heartbroken and despondent. I
[16673.21s -> 16692.46s]  won't be redeeming a wink again. I want to get the, uh, the thing. I want to go on the table.
[16693.26s -> 16707.07s]  Let's make it easy. Omega Lala. I'm sure germ is upset to hear that. Why are you making me some
[16707.07s -> 16720.97s]  kind of villain? Why am I a villain? Is this the highest this shit goes? Like, oh, I'm sure germ is
[16720.97s -> 16730.97s]  so sad to hear that. Oh, I'm going to turn the CD off and then dad's going to freak out, right?
[16731.77s -> 16756.35s]  Just barely. Candy bar wrappers. Cookie box. That's going to freak out. All right,
[16756.35s -> 16768.25s]  turn the TV back on. Did he figure out how to pronounce refuse yet? That's how,
[16768.25s -> 16790.94s]  that's what that word sounds like to me. This is way too high. Oh wait, he's on top of the TV.
[16790.94s -> 16811.24s]  Should I talk to him first? Look up, you fool. I know, but I'm not tall enough to get over there.
[16811.24s -> 16825.90s]  I know there's a frog going over there. All right, I'm turning this TV off. All right, dad.
[16825.90s -> 16846.19s]  You're going to have to find something else to do. TV's going off. Hey, hold it. Hold it. Whoa.
[16846.91s -> 16861.74s]  Space Hunter Drake Red Crest is on. Dad just gave you 19 happy points.
[16864.67s -> 16883.29s]  How can I get a three shirt? No, Ribbit. Chibi-ro-bit. That was close. Ribbit. Oh,
[16883.29s -> 16910.72s]  do you want one of these? I have one. Ribbit, maybe? Yes. Yay, a bit. 13 happy points. Ribbit,
[16910.72s -> 16936.60s]  Gibby. Cookie box. You're encouraging her too much. This isn't Monster Rancher. Six more. Ribbit.
[16937.64s -> 16948.97s]  All right, good. Where else do I need here? Up there. Up there, up here. I can't, I don't think
[16948.97s -> 16965.28s]  I can reach up there though. There's a frog ring in there. I'm getting it. Can I get it? Mr. Wink?
[16965.28s -> 16988.27s]  I just did it. There. Two Winks? I got the one from before too. The one from like 10 minutes
[16988.27s -> 17007.18s]  ago. I got it. No, this one on the other hand, I didn't get. Shit. It's just barely not tall enough.
[17007.18s -> 17021.92s]  Come on. Wait. All right. I have a plan. My plan is to push that onto here. No, it's not going to
[17021.92s -> 17032.17s]  work. Does he not know it's on? Whatever. Do you think I care about the webcam being on? I'm a
[17032.17s -> 17046.56s]  streamer. It should be on. He doesn't know. You guys shouldn't have said anything. You would have
[17046.56s -> 17050.48s]  got me fucking putting my finger up my nose or like biting my lip and like eating boogers or
[17050.48s -> 17058.16s]  something. You guys fucked that up. Big time. I really did not know it was still on and you could
[17058.16s -> 17064.08s]  have seen like a booger reading. Wow. You, one opportunity in like seven years. That was it and
[17064.08s -> 17070.96s]  you ruined it. You've, you just missed a full booger being swallowed. I can't believe it.
[17091.68s -> 17100.94s]  Oh, Chibi Robo. I love it. All right. I'm going to bring, can I bring this thing into other rooms?
[17101.58s -> 17125.24s]  Redeemed a German booger. Dude, hog super frog voice. So this can't go up any higher.
[17126.12s -> 17143.16s]  For real. All right. Go up. Shit. All right. I think I've done everything I can do with
[17143.16s -> 17149.44s]  how tall this is. Maybe not. Wait over there. Jeremy, you missed two boogers.
[17150.40s -> 17154.56s]  If I had a booger eating channel point redemption, I wouldn't be able to produce
[17154.56s -> 17181.58s]  that many boogers. What are you talking about? I know this dirt over here. I'm trying to get up
[17181.58s -> 17204.40s]  there. Oh, okay. All right. You got, okay. You guys are starting to disgust me.
[17205.60s -> 17231.93s]  You're starting to disgust me. Nothing in here. I'm just barely not going to be able to make this.
[17232.57s -> 17257.42s]  Come on. Yes, I can. No. What? What? Are you kidding me? I can't make this. Really? That's so sad.
[17265.98s -> 17280.73s]  I'm done. I'm done with this game. I'm done with this game. Wait, there's a book here. Hey,
[17280.73s -> 17287.55s]  it's a photo album. Neat. Do you want to check it out? Yeah. I'm done with this game. You're
[17287.55s -> 17295.98s]  having a barbecue. Sniff. I never get tired of looking at photos. Don't I have a photograph?
[17297.90s -> 17306.09s]  I'm having a barbecue. Don't I have? I have a picture. Can I put it in there?
[17309.84s -> 17325.88s]  I guess I can't put it in. All right. I think that's all I could do with that.
[17325.88s -> 17330.89s]  There's not much else I can. I got to do some cleaning. Anything else I can get with this
[17330.89s -> 17340.72s]  ladder? Bad streamer. I think I got everything I can get. Maybe up this way? Have I done
[17340.72s -> 17352.25s]  anything up there? Let's check. Lady Powas. Wait, is the Powas over here? What's the plug over here?
[17353.05s -> 17409.87s]  I'm not giving in. I'm not giving in. I'm not giving into this shit. That's all I can do. I
[17409.87s -> 17431.24s]  can't get up there. Not yet. Oh, then we're gonna do some cleaning and I should have enough points
[17431.24s -> 17456.72s]  to upgrade again, right? Is Otto a... Otto's doing just fine. He's over here. He's hanging up.
[17459.16s -> 17474.97s]  Cleaning time. Like a good robo. Wait, I can go upstairs. I have the ladder. No, I don't.
[17475.21s -> 17483.64s]  Cleaned up a total of 135 stains. Hardware cleaning. Happy points.
[17490.11s -> 17497.82s]  Oh, happy points. Doing the super frog noise.
[17501.64s -> 17523.40s]  Somebody was outside with their muddy shoes. Okay. A bit more over here. I gotta be close. What about
[17523.40s -> 17539.10s]  outside? I'm kind of stuck with what I should do next. Let me see. Let me see what's available to
[17539.10s -> 17560.97s]  buy. Missed a stain. I'll be fine. Upload those happy points.
[17571.76s -> 17580.36s]  55. I'm almost in the top 50. How much do I have? Do I have enough for the car?
[17581.32s -> 17606.91s]  Yeah, nice booger image. I saw it. How much is the car? Hot rod. 2740.
[17608.35s -> 17615.96s]  I'm almost there. I'm going outside. I feel like I haven't explored outside a whole lot.
[17621.08s -> 17637.64s]  Outside is... Why did I say the booger thing? That's on me. That's a mistake. I have to remember.
[17638.60s -> 17643.79s]  I have to remember that there's a bunch of people here that are going to say it and repeat it.
[17643.79s -> 17653.15s]  And again, it's going to follow me around. Okay. We need something out here.
[17659.58s -> 17694.46s]  Fighters! See you next time on Dragon Ball Z. It's find out next time. Fuck. No, now they're
[17694.46s -> 17699.02s]  going to know I've never seen one full episode of the show. And all they know... They're going to
[17699.02s -> 17705.50s]  know that the only thing I've ever done is I've YouTubeed random scenes from Dragon Ball Super
[17705.50s -> 17712.43s]  for no reason. I've watched a bunch of Beerus stuff for no reason. I have no intention to watch
[17712.43s -> 17737.90s]  the show. I don't know why I did that. They're going to know this. Backyard. Did you watch JoJo
[17737.90s -> 17778.78s]  though? No. Still haven't given the frog any water. This is so sad. It's actually sad.
[17779.18s -> 17788.03s]  Why hasn't somebody like picked up the frog? Where's the family? All dad does is watch cartoons
[17788.03s -> 17810.70s]  all day. Oh, shit. Frog coin. Wait, this means shoot. This means shoot this... Shoot this. This
[17810.70s -> 17851.13s]  dog bone over there. Donald Duck. Can I pick this up? Wait, why can't I pick this up? It's stuck in
[17852.65s -> 17887.71s]  the goddamn ground. I need to dig it up. Metroidvania. There's a demon door up here.
[17887.71s -> 17900.08s]  There's a spider nest up here. Open the demon door. Remember, you're very likeable and admirable.
[17900.08s -> 17913.60s]  What's up? Thank you. The spider's nest. Can I shoot it?
[17919.24s -> 17946.03s]  Fuck out of here. Singalata. Sleeping baby birds. Hello? He's in a deep sleep. If he
[17946.03s -> 17971.58s]  doesn't move, we can't get to the other side. How do we wake up the bird? Recycle the bird.
[17971.58s -> 17978.72s]  I don't think it works like that. There's another demon door here. I gotta be careful though.
[17982.00s -> 18030.80s]  I can buy the car. Can I go anywhere else? I can go over there. What's that? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18030.80s -> 18053.08s]  Where's the plug? Where's the outlet? It's just right here. Where is it? Isn't it right? I thought
[18053.08s -> 18062.20s]  it was right here. It's a plug right here. Isn't there? Where is it? There's no outlets outside.
[18062.20s -> 18094.41s]  No! I have a battery, right? Okay, my battery. Oh, the battery is consumed. Shit.
[18097.23s -> 18101.55s]  Oh my fucking god. I just lost like $600.
[18101.55s -> 18137.69s]  I've only died twice in five hours. Come on. You're making a fucking mess. Wait, how much?
[18143.50s -> 18148.38s]  For your ladder. Oh, I'm gonna, okay. It's daytime. We're gonna go kill some spiders and make a ladder
[18148.38s -> 18160.68s]  of the foyer. Your chibi bank account is chibi low. All right, I need to do.
[18161.96s -> 18179.77s]  Fuck, I'm so mad. I have to go kill spiders. I'm just gonna clean. They have to be there. I have
[18179.77s -> 18195.95s]  to go up in the backyard during the day. It's okay, Derma. Everything is gonna heal. Time for some
[18195.95s -> 18217.77s]  chibi tax evasion. All right, any spiders in the foyer? I need scrap. Maybe you should crash the
[18217.77s -> 18242.01s]  chibi housing market. Chibi gamble all your money away. I can't even do anything in here.
[18242.57s -> 18257.12s]  I need to get attacked by spiders and then we ran out of time last time. Can I go back to bed?
[18257.76s -> 18265.72s]  Would I dress up as chibi for a Halloween special? Talk to the eggs? Wait, I didn't already do that?
[18266.52s -> 18278.91s]  How does one dress up as chibi robo? Private Vegas reporting for duty. Uh-huh.
[18280.17s -> 18283.29s]  You know that beautiful hunk of hot rods sitting up on the second floor?
[18284.64s -> 18293.53s]  Yeah. You got a good eye on you, kid. Uh-huh. I've got a tricked out hot rod. When my tour with the
[18293.53s -> 18330.28s]  free rangers ends, I'm gonna be a race car driver. Sounds pretty cool, Vegas. The broomer. All right,
[18330.92s -> 18341.93s]  he's gonna waste time until tomorrow so I can attack by spiders outside. I think I'm done with
[18341.93s -> 18350.89s]  the game. I'm done with this game. It's like, all right. It's like fun, but yeah, it was like,
[18350.89s -> 18363.82s]  all right. Are you gonna stream it again? Um, I don't know. Like maybe. It's like maybe. It's
[18363.82s -> 18368.92s]  like possible. It's not like a priority, but like maybe. I don't know. I'm not like, you know what
[18368.92s -> 18401.71s]  I mean? Pranked! Pranked! All right, let's go back in here. Can I get to the spoon? I can't
[18401.71s -> 18415.45s]  probably until I get the ladder in there. 61. All right, I don't need to go to bed.
[18416.70s -> 18423.58s]  I don't want to save. Where's the sleep button? Can I just go to bed? How do I shut off?
[18425.80s -> 18429.08s]  All right, chibi robo, smash your head against the wall as hard as you can.
[18429.08s -> 18442.54s]  I'll put the put the costume on. That's a costume you can get. Oh, you force the next day with a
[18442.54s -> 18471.36s]  costume. Wait, can't I just do this? Just buy the shorter clock. I could do that.
[18475.45s -> 18479.53s]  This is probably something else I can do just to pass the time. Oh, let me like clean up some
[18480.09s -> 18505.68s]  junk. Let me pick up some Cheetos on this guy's fucking couch. The dog's on here. Can we talk to
[18505.68s -> 18518.78s]  the dog? I guess not. Talk to the eggs again. All right, I'll get out there after I get these, uh,
[18518.78s -> 18564.60s]  coins. And we get the boots. I kind of wonder what this face looks like. How about some trash?
[18566.64s -> 18603.20s]  Put the camera on again. If I laugh, he doesn't know. If I laugh, if I laugh, if I face, he doesn't
[18603.20s -> 18612.46s]  know. Doesn't know. Medic, we've got a robo down. Wait a second, you're not hurt at all.
[18613.42s -> 18628.80s]  That is one sick joke, soldier. Ah, TV Robo, I knew that was you. You can't scare a grizzled
[18628.80s -> 18660.97s]  veteran like me. Wait, TV Robo, I knew that was you. Space Hunter Drake Redcrest. Oh boy,
[18660.97s -> 18677.69s]  could you, uh, autograph my, my, uh, oh man, I'm so nervous. Private Frisco on dirty, sir.
[18678.65s -> 18687.82s]  Freed Rangers rule one. When the Sarge gives an order, you say, sir. Yes, sir. I'm Tex. Sarge
[18687.82s -> 18693.98s]  had the free Rangers photo last, but he lost it. That photo has to be around here somewhere. I have
[18693.98s -> 18703.63s]  it. I'm Tex. Sarge had the wifi photo last, but he lost it. I have it.
[18728.20s -> 18742.22s]  We took this back when we were first deployed at the Sanderson house.
[18742.86s -> 18754.09s]  General Sanderson took this photo. We were a full platoon then. That was before the incident.
[18755.45s -> 18801.00s]  We were doing our daily physical training routine. Okay, that's when the enemy attacked. The dog.
[18827.08s -> 18860.46s]  Ooh, he's gonna eat him. Memphis. I know what's gotta be done. We have to train harder so that
[18860.54s -> 18863.90s]  one day we will win the war against the great beast.
[18865.98s -> 18873.82s]  We need to make sure we never lose another Ranger in battle. Thank you,
[18873.82s -> 18880.40s]  Cheapie Robo. You helped me remember my true purpose. 20 happy points.
[18881.84s -> 18888.38s]  Where are the happiness? Anything else? Slap me with a landmine sandwich.
[18889.96s -> 18911.26s]  We're still a man short. You're slacking. Start over again. Initiate roll call. Sound off.
[18913.08s -> 18925.08s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
[18926.83s -> 18937.02s]  fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Everyone is accounted for, sir.
[18938.30s -> 18944.59s]  Show up for roll call or the whole army suffers. It looks like everyone's here,
[18944.59s -> 18957.98s]  so today's your lucky day. No one suffers. 20 happy points. Good, roll call is officially done.
[18959.24s -> 18969.68s]  Go, go, go. We're getting physical training. What do we have to do for physical training?
[18969.68s -> 18985.95s]  Have to do this too? I'm Montana. We're working out. I'm Orlando. Private Memphis used to stand
[18985.95s -> 18990.91s]  right there. Now the Sarge screams at us every day at roll call. It's all because he's gone.
[18991.87s -> 19008.46s]  I'm Cincy. We're working out. I'm Oregon. Sarge still talks about Private Memphis all the time.
[19009.42s -> 19018.40s]  I'm Tucson. Free Ranger's rule number five. Failing to follow orders is punishable by
[19018.40s -> 19042.81s]  scrambling. I'll rest until the great hairy threat is defeated. All right, fighters. All right,
[19042.81s -> 19075.74s]  gentlemen, army, roll out. Let's go. I have enough to build the foyer thing. Thanks for nothing, guys.
[19075.74s -> 19088.30s]  I'm gonna do this.
[19091.00s -> 19100.38s]  This is the resting. Hey, it looks like you found yourself a nice place to rest.
[19102.14s -> 19105.58s]  Oh, you still have work to do. Make hay while the sun shines.
[19106.22s -> 19125.95s]  No, I think I'm gonna just take a break. That was nice.
[19125.95s -> 19138.88s]  I'm gonna make myself happy. You know, Chibi-Robo is all about spreading happiness. But what about
[19138.88s -> 19144.48s]  Chibi-Robo's happiness? Don't we need to be concerned about that too? What about that?
[19147.13s -> 19166.92s]  Let's buy the new ladder. He's a robot. He has no feelings.
[19167.88s -> 19172.84s]  But what if he still has to? His joints have to rest. His robot joints. Otherwise,
[19172.84s -> 19176.28s]  we're gonna overwork him and he's gonna break. There you go. There's your reason.
[19176.28s -> 19216.19s]  I gotta be in the top 30. 43. It's time to make the ladder. For your ladder. Let's go.
[19219.77s -> 19240.88s]  50 streamer. Oh, man. Seriously. Damn. You're still going with this game. Wow. This is like
[19240.88s -> 19247.66s]  one of the most classic video games ever made. This is, this didn't just like come out in the
[19248.46s -> 19253.56s]  second new release page on Steam. You know, like not, you know, you don't
[19253.56s -> 19268.91s]  guys know what I'm talking about. This won an Oscar. I don't think we have enough time,
[19268.91s -> 19273.79s]  but I want to go see it. Let's go to the foyer. Oh, it's, yeah, that's right. Let's go, go, go.
[19273.79s -> 19288.62s]  This won five game of the year awards. What's wrong with, uh, Falcon? What are you doing standing
[19288.62s -> 19300.25s]  here? Island's Fool. An ill wind blows tonight. Has something happened to Mr. and Mrs. Sanderson?
[19301.50s -> 19308.32s]  Break Red Crest also heard Jenny weep large, bitter tears. Pursue sadness. I will continue
[19308.32s -> 19335.04s]  my patrol upstairs. An ill wind. All right, let's go. It's got a lot to explore today.
[19336.32s -> 19357.72s]  I'll set it up for tomorrow. Go over here. What is that? A stain? Not on my watch.
[19358.44s -> 19404.64s]  Let's juice it up. Oh, can I get anything from there? Yeah. Well, I can get the cookies.
[19407.36s -> 19420.44s]  Move it back a bit. Was it hitting the, is it hitting the thing?
[19422.57s -> 19434.64s]  How's he stuck? He's stuck. I gotta put him down.
[19434.64s -> 19462.64s]  All right. Ah, this game's noises are 10 out of 10. They are actually really good. They're very
[19462.64s -> 19484.89s]  good. Good morning. I'm fucking doing that. Don't do that anymore. Look what you're doing.
[19484.89s -> 19498.49s]  Still 43 Omega Low. Yeah, whatever. No, I want to pick up the trash.
[19508.56s -> 19522.86s]  I'm just leaving it. Oh, people were saying that if I'm going to do GameCube,
[19522.86s -> 19529.52s]  I should get Cubivore. Now that's a very interesting thing to say. I looked up Cubivore.
[19529.52s -> 19534.48s]  It was like, wow, that seems interesting. I think the game is $300. Is it worth,
[19534.48s -> 19551.93s]  is it worth $300? It's a $300 game. You could emulate it. Is this on Dolphin? No,
[19551.93s -> 19559.45s]  this is on original hardware. But all right, but if it's $300, is that, I mean, these are going to
[19559.45s -> 19564.01s]  appreciate in value. If I, if I hold like a, this is Chibi-Robo. This game is worth like a hundred
[19564.01s -> 19576.14s]  bucks. In 10 years, this game's going to be worth like 500 bucks. These are assets. All right,
[19576.14s -> 19587.45s]  where's, I need to go to the foyer straight ahead. Like is Cubivore going to be a thousand dollars
[19587.45s -> 19607.18s]  in 2028? That's Beanie Baby logic. I'm not so sure about that because these people still want to
[19607.18s -> 19629.56s]  play these old games on the original hardware in quotes. Only ones in mint condition will be worth
[19629.56s -> 19637.31s]  it. Have you seen the condition of this disc? Would you be willing to take a thousand dollars
[19637.31s -> 19640.99s]  from someone for this game? I'd be willing to look at who's giving me a telephone call.
[19640.99s -> 19651.44s]  Well, I don't, I don't know. What's, if someone's going to pay me a thousand dollars for this game,
[19651.44s -> 19658.70s]  would I do it? Yes, absolutely. Why wouldn't I? You mean like right now? Why wouldn't I do that?
[19658.70s -> 19668.27s]  All right, we're going to go, uh, where do I want to take this letter? Okay, go up on the sofa. Red
[19668.27s -> 19692.04s]  block. My Cubivore still has the $20 sticker on it. Wait, I can't go on the carpet. Uh-oh, I have to
[19693.50s -> 19715.29s]  shit. Use it right here. Hold on, I gotta put it up. What if somebody gets the rights to this game
[19715.29s -> 19728.00s]  and plans to make a million copies? Well, um, this thing's going up way higher than it did before.
[19728.80s -> 19735.87s]  I need an outlet now. So you're saying that somebody's going to buy the rights to Chibi
[19735.87s -> 19753.58s]  Robo and then flood the market with Chibi Robo discs. What's happened with Nancy Drew?
[19755.79s -> 19790.65s]  Wait, you know, you can sell, yeah. Okay. What's the rights to Chibi Robo? Oh shit, I have to hold on.
[19792.52s -> 19817.10s]  Fly, fly, fly. Look at the trash. God, I'm so pissed off. I have the rights. Do you really? Holy shit.
[19818.30s -> 19826.80s]  What? No way. That's fucking crazy, dude. Get out of here. Yeah, the person that owns it is here.
[19829.84s -> 19836.86s]  That's so fucking sick, man. What was it like working on the game?
[19851.13s -> 19855.24s]  All right, now what can I, I can't do anything with this, but the
[19856.20s -> 19866.36s]  Millennium Falcon thing and I fly over there. Let's get a good view and go up there.
[19867.32s -> 19883.96s]  I wonder if I can make it to the red block. Upstairs time. Pog. Not yet. I'm not really into
[19883.96s -> 19887.96s]  the game. Like I'm just going to say it. You know what I mean? Like I should have made that fucking
[19887.96s -> 19904.67s]  jump. I think I'm done. Let's go even hot. No, pull back. He's just doing this joke for the third time.
[19904.83s -> 19922.68s]  I'm going to move this out of the way. Stop. Maybe he means it this time. No, it's not even stuck on
[19922.68s -> 19933.26s]  anything. It's not even stuck on anything. I just saw, I just did it. It's not stuck on anything.
[19933.82s -> 19964.38s]  Stop going up. Chibi. Chibi. Pull it. What the fuck is going on here? Why is it just going up?
[19975.84s -> 19999.74s]  I did lower it when I lowered it five, six times and it went back up on its own.
[19999.74s -> 20013.39s]  Get the fuck over here. Stop going up. Stop going up. It's going, it's going.
[20022.16s -> 20029.29s]  And when I let go of the stick, it goes back up. Yeah. Stop it. This is going back up. It better
[20029.29s -> 20066.11s]  not be. Grab. More. Of course I'm out of fucking power. It doesn't even read chat. Yes, I do.
[20068.28s -> 20092.70s]  I see it. That was just, I was in, I just rewound. How long have I been streaming? Oh,
[20093.82s -> 20118.89s]  probably one of the longer ones. Like 13 hours. 12 and a half, 13 hours. All the way past the plants.
[20118.89s -> 20155.16s]  That's as high as it can go. Recharge. Streams with lifetime. Five hours and 36 minutes. Well,
[20155.16s -> 20160.16s]  I mean, it's going to say that because I disconnected like four or five times. So
[20161.74s -> 20179.55s]  flat. I mean, this is probably the stream. I have to disconnect. I mean like four. Three. It's three.
[20179.55s -> 20196.06s]  Yeah. Well, we definitely can't get up there. We can get over there. We can get up to the,
[20196.06s -> 20203.69s]  all right. Can't move this out of the way. Maybe I, yes I can. Oh, this is so, so addicting. Stop
[20203.69s -> 20224.04s]  being so addicting. I have to move the, I gotta move the ladder across the whole thing. Trash.
[20224.12s -> 20226.84s]  There's one of these. I can push it over there.
[20229.00s -> 20255.77s]  Okay. Break the photo. You fucking monster. I'm not going upstairs yet. I want to get that demon
[20255.77s -> 20274.72s]  door. I want to get the demon door across. Speak to the eggs. I will. You're running out of time.
[20274.72s -> 20279.05s]  All right. All right. Just wait. I'm not, there's no such thing as running out of time.
[20280.01s -> 20284.78s]  I'll come back in the next, tomorrow. It's fine. I'm going to kick your ass.
[20285.84s -> 20306.67s]  Oh, are you? Okay. Do you want to do some spy training? Yes, of course I do. Find the spy.
[20307.63s -> 20316.65s]  You're free rangers. You're hard-boiled. I'm Detroit. I'm Tex. I'm Frisco. I'm Orlando. I'm
[20316.65s -> 20336.22s]  the spy. Hunt down the spy. I know who the spy is. Got you. Two happy points. Holy shit. What?
[20336.22s -> 20351.92s]  That wasn't even worth doing. All right. I'm the spy. Oh, I think I might have lost it.
[20352.56s -> 20357.42s]  It's one again. One again.
[20377.13s -> 20377.45s]  Again.
[20401.28s -> 20426.09s]  Oh, you didn't even fucking move. I'm the spy. All right. Let's go again. I'm Detroit.
[20426.73s -> 20453.80s]  I'm Tex. I'm the spy. Three. You got me. All right. Just gave you two happy points.
[20457.08s -> 20464.33s]  Number three. Let's go. I'm standing in the fucking way. I'm Tex. I'm Frisco.
[20464.97s -> 20502.11s]  I'm Orlando and I'm the spy. Two. Two. Four happy points. Number four? I thought he said do it three
[20502.11s -> 20523.36s]  times in a row. I fucking lost it. I think it's two. I think it's one. It's three. I wish I was
[20523.36s -> 20545.21s]  standing in the way. Three, I think. Let's do the three or one. Yeah, I got this one. Five happy
[20545.21s -> 20551.61s]  points. Let's do this again. Ready to sharpen up. Five. Okay. I'm going to need you guys' help for
[20551.61s -> 20590.09s]  this one. Four. Four. Got it. How many times did you do this in a row? Seven happy points.
[20602.16s -> 20627.68s]  Okay. Two. I think it's four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Wink. Three or four?
[20627.68s -> 20637.76s]  Is it three or four? Oh, we have some division here. It's three. It's three. I would have said
[20637.76s -> 20644.46s]  four. Is it four? Four. You idiots. Four. I'm gonna say four. I said four originally as well.
[20645.18s -> 20667.42s]  Yeah. No! It's all right. I passed it. Sorry, Jerm. We said three. Well,
[20669.02s -> 20690.56s]  other wheezes said four. Handrail training. Handrail training. Are you here to try handrail
[20690.56s -> 20701.50s]  training? Yes. This is going to teach you how to run fast so you can catch Tao.
[20702.94s -> 20706.14s]  Just run on top of the handrail and to the end of the course, then run back.
[20707.34s -> 20730.04s]  Free, Rangers, you're hard-boiled. Go, go, go. How's this? This just don't fall. Now run back.
[20744.51s -> 20754.94s]  Finish! Handrail training time. 31 seconds. You passed handrail training. So talented.
[20755.74s -> 20762.51s]  That's a lot of points though. Jungle training is next.
[20773.63s -> 20777.47s]  We're done with training for the day. I thought you wanted to do jungle training.
[20782.27s -> 20791.15s]  I'm almost out of time so I might as well clean up the puke.
[20791.95s -> 20802.51s]  Need more trash. There's a little bit of trash over here.
[20803.79s -> 20833.84s]  No, no, no. I want these. I want the scrap. I want that scrap. I thought an ad was playing.
[20834.72s -> 20843.71s]  All right, we're going to come back tomorrow and we're going to go upstairs.
[20844.75s -> 20853.23s]  Tomorrow is when we go upstairs. But I'm going to see if I can get in this demon door before
[20853.23s -> 20871.37s]  time runs out. How high is it? High enough? Let's hope so. I'll stop streaming yet. Oh no,
[20871.37s -> 20903.93s]  I'm talking about like tomorrow in the game. Another demon door up there too. I have enough
[20903.93s -> 20916.24s]  for the car now for sure. 29. Just don't die. All right, I think I can get it. I just have to
[20916.24s -> 20945.47s]  put it up a little higher. I'm going to run out of time I think. I'm going to say nope.
[20946.11s -> 20966.49s]  Better to be safe than dead. That's yes, that's true. Can't go up any higher.
[20968.97s -> 20995.71s]  Why not? It could go up so high. You saw how high we could just get this to go. Really?
[20995.71s -> 21013.60s]  Doesn't know. What do I not know? Cam's on? Oh, I can't get the other one over here.
[21014.24s -> 21017.44s]  Even if I push it down this way. This thing's not big enough.
[21018.24s -> 21033.58s]  But can I get to anywhere else? Oh, I can. Quick, get the snack. Get the can.
[21034.86s -> 21044.38s]  He is unaware of future events that may transpire, resulting in him having a negative
[21044.38s -> 21047.42s]  experience that would be humorous to his viewing audience. Pepe laugh.
[21048.30s -> 21072.97s]  Cam's off. I gotta be pretty high. 26. I would love to save. I would also love to see if I can
[21072.97s -> 21093.74s]  buy anything. What else you got in here? Kitchen ladder. Yep, yep, yep, buy it. We can finally get
[21093.74s -> 21115.76s]  the spoon. We can get the spoon to stir mom's drink. It's a utility bottle. All right, so buy
[21115.76s -> 21130.62s]  the car. We're looking for advice. Is morality objective or subjective? Thanks. I don't even
[21130.62s -> 21136.30s]  know what that means. That's too much for right now. I don't even, I don't, I don't even know.
[21138.06s -> 21169.80s]  Okay, I'm gonna get car. A popular car among racers. Buy. One full letter grade. I'm so excited.
[21170.52s -> 21176.97s]  I'm playing chibi-robo right now. I'm not going to question life's moralities. I'm cleaning as a
[21176.97s -> 21193.07s]  robot. All right, where's the car? Where's the car? How do I, where do I get it? Oh, all right.
[21193.07s -> 21211.93s]  All right, let's go. We're going upstairs. Wait, where's the trash? I want to throw this crap away.
[21212.73s -> 21217.36s]  I don't get to give it a full letter grade? That's kind of unfair. All right, we're going upstairs.
[21221.02s -> 21239.31s]  Please read this important haha nerd. Time that person up 10 minutes. Because, I mean, you're
[21240.27s -> 21249.21s]  gonna, hey, read this extremely important. No, come on. You're drunk. Why is he in the way?
[21273.95s -> 21280.09s]  But you are a nerd. Read this haha nerd. You're trying to get my attention with all caps. You're
[21280.09s -> 21286.83s]  gonna, I'm giving you 10 minutes. We've got, we've got to start to, we've got to start to quell.
[21287.47s -> 21331.16s]  Read this penis. That person 10 minutes too. Guys. All right, I'm going upstairs. People are crying
[21331.16s -> 21339.31s]  upstairs. So, I hope you guys are ready. By the way, Frog still has not received any water.
[21340.11s -> 21355.64s]  I want to make that clear. Okay, ban that person for 10 minutes. Okay. Ban that person for 5
[21355.64s -> 21377.31s]  minutes. I don't want to see them anymore. Yeah, get rid of that person. Oh, I need the thing.
[21377.95s -> 21391.92s]  Ban that person permanently. Because that's, oh yeah, I'm not going to look and fucking say
[21391.92s -> 21409.52s]  that to me. All right, I just gotta go up and then I can get over there. So, I need to be charged
[21409.52s -> 21436.32s]  first. You got him? All right, good. Permanent, right? Good. Thanks a lot. All right, let's go
[21436.32s -> 21463.15s]  upstairs. You can't stop me. You can't stop me. I am the stream. He did the funny voice. Hello.
[21463.15s -> 21481.87s]  Give him 15,000 upvotes. Wait, can I, can I even get over here? Am I even gonna,
[21481.87s -> 21498.84s]  can I even climb up this? This room is begging for upvotes. Please. Please. Wait, there's like
[21498.84s -> 21522.08s]  photos over there. Why is this guy gonna fight TF2? It is a TF2 waiting room. You mean TF2 like
[21522.08s -> 21536.44s]  purgatory room. You're not going anywhere. I'm gonna try to get it from here. All right,
[21536.44s -> 21558.16s]  what's up here? Pick a photo? Oh, look at how happy they are. Demon door. Rain world purgatory.
[21558.16s -> 21589.71s]  Rain world. Where's rain world? They got lost in the mill. Anything else over here? All right,
[21589.71s -> 21600.97s]  I'm gonna use the railing now. There's a lot of things that are in purgatory, I think, right?
[21614.11s -> 21636.96s]  Yeah, you. Imagine if this was purgatory. Imagine if we were in purgatory right now.
[21636.96s -> 21700.54s]  Fucked up. What if this is hell? On that railing. I went over it. Fuck. I mean, technically,
[21700.54s -> 21710.11s]  you can be in heaven or hell on earth while not being there mortally. Oh. Here we go. And here we
[21710.11s -> 21733.00s]  go. Here we go. Well, everything after every sentence I say go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.
[21733.00s -> 21791.10s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking railing. All right, I'm on. I'm car. I'm here. Car. Car. My car. My car.
[21795.32s -> 21812.27s]  Open the door. Give me my car. What? It's just a neutral. There's no gas. Sad human detected.
[21812.27s -> 21818.22s]  Sad human detected. All right, I'm coming over there with my car. We're gonna work this out.
[21818.22s -> 21840.11s]  Well, let me get the money first. Okay, well, let me plug in first. I need to have a full charge
[21840.11s -> 21858.00s]  for this. I'm going. I put. You want me to try to help somebody without. What if I run out of battery?
[21858.00s -> 21892.94s]  All right, I'm here. What's going on? Oh, hello, chibi. She's talking. You came all the way up here
[21892.94s -> 21909.15s]  because you heard Jenny crying, right? And he says thank you. The bear can talk.
[21923.71s -> 21928.03s]  Somebody said, oh my god, the bear can talk. Jenny says she's upset because mom and dad aren't
[21928.03s -> 21935.15s]  getting along. All right, this is getting heavy. All right, no more comedy. Mom won't let dad
[21935.15s -> 21943.74s]  sleep in their bedroom. I want to go into mom's room, but I can't move since I'm a stuffed animal.
[21944.70s -> 21954.76s]  All right, I'll get you in there. Just get in my car. What do you mean you did this? I did this?
[21954.76s -> 21960.20s]  What do you? This is no, this is like 30 years of trouble with marriage. I didn't do this. What do
[21960.20s -> 21974.46s]  you mean? I didn't do anything. They ordered me on Amazon like six days ago. I didn't do anything.
[21974.46s -> 21986.56s]  Mom walks the door at night, but she leaves the door open all day. All right, so we're gonna come
[21986.56s -> 21997.44s]  back during the day and go into mom's room. How am I gonna reach it? Give me my fucking car.
[22003.15s -> 22008.03s]  I can't. I want to just use the fucking car. Why? Why? I just want to drive around.
[22010.46s -> 22030.99s]  Come on. I just want to be like Stuart Little for once. Please. Fine. What else is over here?
[22030.99s -> 22055.05s]  I think I can get there from here. The demon door. Wait, shoot this. I mean, this is a confirmed
[22055.05s -> 22077.60s]  bed in the Metroid Prime mechanics. I gotta come back during the day. I have enough juice
[22077.60s -> 22098.46s]  for the demon door here. I don't know. I'm just getting some juice. Hold on. There's too much to
[22098.46s -> 22106.01s]  do. I'm going. I go back up there. Just hold on. I can go on. I know I look. I can get on the railing
[22106.01s -> 22128.96s]  right here. I just want to get the demon door. You saw what I was doing. I'm stomped up. You're
[22128.96s -> 22172.27s]  hurting his spine. Be all right. Energy wasted. We can go faster. Someone just said literally
[22172.27s -> 22180.27s]  fucking for IQ. What a fucking idiot. Stupid fucking moron. Relax, dude. And that guy forever.
[22180.59s -> 22209.40s]  Actually, I'm going to report him. You can walk off ledges with the chibi copter and float normally.
[22209.40s -> 22212.84s]  You don't always have to press to fly because you walk off a ledge to use it.
[22213.56s -> 22220.68s]  And then they say it's stupid fucking dumb idiot or IQ fucking moron. What the fuck?
[22230.25s -> 22251.00s]  All right, let's go in your room. I'm going in. It's open. The door is open.
[22252.52s -> 22258.84s]  Oh, I just picture you go, you tell your neck, you know, you mean, that's what I imagine.
[22258.84s -> 22266.28s]  This is what I imagine people were doing there. The door is open. You can go in. Oh, like you just
[22266.28s -> 22274.72s]  point your eyes and then you fucking scream three teeth. Oh, everybody. It's okay. I'm going to get
[22274.72s -> 22299.82s]  there. Lots of trash over here. Lots of trash in the kids room. Get it quick before time runs out.
[22299.82s -> 22313.80s]  Oh my god, there's so much trash. Get it all quick. Time's running out. That doesn't matter.
[22313.80s -> 22323.08s]  I can come back tomorrow. By the way, everybody has one of these under their bed,
[22324.70s -> 22329.58s]  especially where your head is, where your headboard is. So hard to get under here.
[22341.15s -> 22356.54s]  Um, Jenny, what are you keeping under here? Jenny, uh, thank god there was an alien in his chest that
[22356.54s -> 22371.44s]  killed him. And I scare you. Yeah, you did actually. I thought we were going to be in trouble.
[22373.36s -> 22384.81s]  Oh, you'll be nice. Everybody's got one of these under their bed.
[22385.37s -> 22393.85s]  I already have random wrappers, throat lozenges that you just find under here,
[22393.85s -> 22401.82s]  which by the way, those are still good. You know how many times I found vitamin C drops under here?
[22401.82s -> 22407.45s]  They're probably three years old. They're going to be fine. They have like a 30 year expiration day
[22407.45s -> 22423.44s]  and they're in a wrapper. That feels so good. All right. More trash.
[22424.16s -> 22439.79s]  True story. Uh, this is a real story. So Kim and I, uh, we did some cleaning and we found,
[22440.51s -> 22450.11s]  uh, we found a container under the bed of Ferrero Rochers. It was a sealed container.
[22451.82s -> 22462.30s]  It was covered in like dirt and dog hair and shit, but it was sealed in the box and we knew
[22462.30s -> 22466.94s]  they were probably like at least three to four months old, but they were still all right. They
[22466.94s -> 22473.48s]  were still within expiration. So we were going back and forth about like, is this shit? We can
[22473.48s -> 22477.56s]  eat these, right? I mean, they were under the bed and covered in dog hair, but they were sealed in
[22477.56s -> 22486.60s]  a container. That's okay. That's a great find. Now don't turn me off. Don't do that. That's not
[22486.60s -> 22491.55s]  that gross. That's not that gross. No, I don't, I don't want to turn the stream off. All right.
[22491.55s -> 22496.84s]  All right. Okay. All right. We'll see you tomorrow.
[22501.84s -> 22507.32s]  As long as it was, it was a sealed box. Yeah, but it was fine.
[22513.36s -> 22532.04s]  I'm number 14 in the world. What do you think? Is that a good place to stop for today?
[22532.04s -> 22535.48s]  I'm being realistic. Yeah. What? Like six and a half hours.
[22536.36s -> 22542.96s]  Let's do the rest tomorrow. I think that's a good place. We've got another probably six,
[22542.96s -> 22548.32s]  seven hours. I want to do this over two streams. This is like a 14 to 15 hour game, right? Like 12
[22548.32s -> 22563.16s]  to 14 hours. Is it another like full probably six, seven hours of this game? Roughly, roughly.
[22563.16s -> 22579.15s]  Okay. This is, this is two hours max. No, that's not 12 to 14 at the rate. Yeah. That's yeah.
[22579.15s -> 22583.23s]  Whatever. That's another like seven hours stream tomorrow. Six to eight hours stream tomorrow.
[22583.23s -> 22590.96s]  Yeah. Yeah. That when we have to just getting upstairs. I'm going to do it. I think this is
[22590.96s -> 22604.86s]  a good place to stop a little bit more. Oh, no, no, we'll stop. We'll stop. We'll stop. We'll stop
[22604.86s -> 22611.82s]  right now. Plus this is a good time that people, uh, you know, I started a little early. No, I did.
[22611.82s -> 22621.44s]  I started. Wait, let me, let me correct this for your warp. What does that do? Let's do it.
[22622.08s -> 22641.77s]  You're not halfway through the game. That's what I'm saying. The game's addictive. Yeah, it is.
[22641.77s -> 22645.07s]  I just want to leave enough time for there to be a full stream for this tomorrow.
[22647.23s -> 22650.51s]  And then after this, that's a really good question. What we're going to do after this.
[22651.07s -> 22666.67s]  There's a lot of stuff that I have back here, but yeah, I'm going to, we'll plug in, we'll save
[22667.31s -> 22670.75s]  and we'll, we'll pick it up after this tomorrow. We're still going to hang out for like 20,
[22670.75s -> 22673.55s]  30 minutes and do the bits. This is a good place to stop, I think.
[22679.00s -> 22692.70s]  So we'll see you tomorrow around 2 p.m. Pacific. See you then or chibi robo part two.
[22698.89s -> 22704.40s]  I am actually going to do something. I'm kind of freaking out about the memory card scenario
[22704.40s -> 22710.00s]  because I mean, this game's already safe and good. Well, I'm, uh, before I go to bed,
[22710.00s -> 22714.48s]  I'm going to turn this on and turn the we often turn it back on and hope that the thing's not
[22714.48s -> 22721.79s]  corrupt. You know, that's like, that's for scaring me. I don't know why it is. It shouldn't happen
[22721.79s -> 22727.85s]  though, but, uh, we'll end it here. Probably see you guys maybe tomorrow starting around that,
[22727.85s -> 22732.33s]  like 1 30 to 2 p.m. Pacific. I just said that, but I'm repeating myself. It's okay.
[22736.03s -> 22748.68s]  See you tomorrow. Thanks for watching part two tomorrow. It's corrupted. God leave the we on.
[22748.68s -> 22752.76s]  No, I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah. If this if it's been working this much, it's it would be fine.
[22753.48s -> 22765.28s]  Let's go back to earlier today. Take care of everybody. If you leave them. We had 250 from
[22765.28s -> 22772.96s]  gnarly earlier and they say, do you really think you can climb the league ladder playing troll
[22772.96s -> 22778.88s]  shit like twisted fate jungle? Oh my God. Jeremy, you have to do well with me. I play top. My scion
[22779.60s -> 22786.48s]  is clean as fuck, but I also play jacks and gnar. If you want to jungle play around top with someone
[22786.48s -> 22796.30s]  like Zach, he's even real league. These league champions. I'll carry you to gold. I feel like
[22796.30s -> 22804.52s]  you're just making up names. I don't play league. Don't listen to any person that tells you I play
[22804.52s -> 22809.88s]  league. Grandpa played league once and it's one of the worst videos I've ever made. It's still up
[22809.88s -> 22815.39s]  and it's still there. You can watch it if you want right now and see. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[22816.33s -> 22823.90s]  Is this the first strand type game? Maybe I'm not going to watch it on stream,
[22826.84s -> 22833.68s]  delete it on stream. No. Belsix. Thanks for the 500 bits. Belsix. I came home from college this
[22833.68s -> 22838.24s]  weekend to visit family and introduced my sister to your streams. My parents saw and they told me
[22838.24s -> 22846.83s]  there is something wrong with you. That's telling them. Just you got to say, you got to introduce
[22846.83s -> 22851.23s]  me as like a comedian. You know what I mean? Like, oh, there's this comedian. He has this show.
[22851.87s -> 22857.40s]  And then they'll be like, oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I see. It's just a show. He's a comedian.
[22858.04s -> 22864.40s]  And then that's, he does, everything's fine. I hope you're not introducing me as a doctor or
[22864.40s -> 22869.69s]  something. Hey, I watched this doctor on stream. Oh, he's a doctor? Oh, he sounds like a fucking
[22869.69s -> 22881.77s]  idiot to me. Always introduce me as an e-clown or as a comedian. Fire 25 shadow. Thanks for the 500
[22881.77s -> 22887.08s]  bits. Five dollars. Thanks for the fantastic streams. You brighten up my day. Looking forward
[22887.08s -> 22893.98s]  to the rest of the year. The more hilarious content. See? I'm not a doctor. Also, you missed my
[22893.98s -> 22912.44s]  wink when Drake Redkiss first appeared. Missing fucking winks. I think that was a lie, but
[22912.44s -> 22924.86s]  whatever. Anyways, thank you for the 500 bits. German lied about the frog coin. Thanks to the
[22924.86s -> 22929.18s]  five community subs. This, I'm telling you, why can't you even have a name that long?
[22929.98s -> 22939.08s]  Why is your name not like striker two or something? I don't know. Why is it Jerma lied about the frog
[22939.08s -> 22954.38s]  coin? Why is your name not something just like, they'll get them. Six, seven, eight. Thanks though
[22954.38s -> 22958.46s]  for the five community subs. Breanne Ben, thanks for the five dollars and 10 cents. Do you think
[22958.46s -> 22963.90s]  Jerma is more compact than chibi robo? Considering I am at least as tall as a fucking chair.
[22964.46s -> 22972.81s]  Um, no. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I mean, yes. Get out of here. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey,
[22972.81s -> 22983.71s]  wingman. Thanks for the 500. Five community subs. Thank you, wingman. God damn it. Uh,
[22984.75s -> 22990.62s]  Jen or Gen Pendulum, thanks for the 300 bits, is another bit dream. I once dreamed that you
[22990.62s -> 22995.10s]  were streaming puppeteering with a Yoda puppet and at one point you forgot his name.
[22995.82s -> 23008.89s]  It's pretty funny. Swoosh. Thanks for the 500 bits. Today's my parent's birthday and we both
[23008.89s -> 23015.88s]  love your streams. All right. Can you wish Marty a happy birthday from me? It'll make their night.
[23015.88s -> 23031.16s]  Happy birthday, Marty. Happy birthday, Marty. Hope you have a good one. Take care. Thanks a lot,
[23031.16s -> 23042.89s]  guys. Hope you enjoy it. It is birthday, man. Yeah. We also had 500 bits, five dollars from
[23042.97s -> 23050.84s]  Yucatare. They say, thanks for doing my sale of requests yesterday. Congratulations on 10 million
[23050.84s -> 23055.08s]  views. An amazing amount for an amazing streamer and content creator. Look at me. Thank you.
[23056.03s -> 23060.91s]  PS item filter as in something that makes a custom sound when an item drops in game. Oh, okay.
[23061.79s -> 23072.49s]  I get it. That makes sense. It'd be a thing. Uh, Jerma's average dong gave 30 community subs over
[23072.49s -> 23081.48s]  the course of the night. So thanks for the 30 subs dong. The username. That's a username that
[23081.48s -> 23092.04s]  you have spent money on a lot of money with average misspelled. He's wonderful. Wonderful.
[23092.04s -> 23103.21s]  Where's where the fuck is striker too? Stripes beast. Thanks for the 500 bits. Thank you again
[23103.21s -> 23109.05s]  for playing this game after watching you cut burn and crush an Asian mother's hand yesterday.
[23109.05s -> 23115.15s]  I'm relieved that you are playing a game about family strife. I'm doing a big road trip soon.
[23115.15s -> 23119.55s]  I'm heading through Vegas. Any spots a poor man would like. Love you in the community.
[23122.33s -> 23132.24s]  Thank you. He called the message one more time.
[23136.44s -> 23148.17s]  Message needed to code. You got it. That's where I think you should go.
[23151.36s -> 23166.35s]  Best restaurant in Vegas. You're a peanuts adult. Red rock is a bit outside town. It's amazing.
[23166.35s -> 23175.28s]  Hiking, walking. That's also true. Red rock Canyon is beautiful. Highly recommend. I have seen it.
[23175.92s -> 23185.50s]  Those are Mount Charleston. They have lodges up there, but that's not really going through Vegas.
[23186.62s -> 23192.48s]  Mount Charleston is like a ski resort, but it is really nice.
[23196.11s -> 23206.89s]  Say hi to my parents. If you see them, they're going to Vegas on Sunday. I will. What are you
[23206.89s -> 23213.77s]  doing? Why? I don't, I don't watch links anymore. Half the time it's, it's fucking Rick roll.
[23226.72s -> 23234.76s]  Hi, what do you got? What is this? Be careful what you wish for a German. I'm curious. What is this?
[23234.76s -> 23254.78s]  I actually really want to know about the music. Hey, what is it around?
[23257.18s -> 23262.38s]  Come on. I just want to feel like Stuart little for once. Please, please, please.
[23270.46s -> 23296.76s]  I don't, I don't actual size. Okay. What do you make this shit? So all right, let's go.
[23297.64s -> 23317.55s]  Hey, there it is. That person said their partner, Marty, not their parents. What?
[23318.43s -> 23339.29s]  Today is my parents' birthday. Let's go back and do that one again. That was swoosh swoosh. Today is
[23339.29s -> 23343.85s]  my partner's birthday. And we both love your stream. Can you give Marty a happy birthday? Happy
[23343.85s -> 23351.50s]  birthday, Marty. Not somebody's parents. You're somebody's partner. I read it wrong. Thank you,
[23351.90s -> 23365.04s]  sorry about the mix up. Yeah, I was right. It's like my parents birthday. We both love your stream.
[23366.00s -> 23369.76s]  For a second I'm like, wait, are you both, are you one of the parents? And I'm like, what the
[23369.76s -> 23384.22s]  fuck am I talking about? Does that sound weird? Yeah, I was wrong. I'm an idiot. It's okay.
[23386.81s -> 23400.40s]  All right, let's keep going. We had, I don't know. Where are we? Right here. We had Jay
[23401.36s -> 23409.34s]  Hawn, Jay Hawnizzle. Thanks for the thousand bits. 10 bucks. Hey, Jeremy, today's my 20th birthday.
[23409.90s -> 23417.16s]  Happy birthday. I'm glad this game was postponed today and I'm sorry about the memory card.
[23417.16s -> 23426.76s]  It's all right. I'm glad that I didn't try to continue to play yesterday. I'm glad we
[23426.76s -> 23431.66s]  pivoted to Cooking Mama. That was also a very fun time for me. So we're good. Thanks for the
[23431.66s -> 23436.14s]  last of the years and I look forward to any big future projects you have planned. Also, please
[23436.22s -> 23444.78s]  show feed on stream. Thank you. Uh, no, I don't think I'm going to do that. Thanks for the 10
[23444.78s -> 23451.68s]  bucks. Appreciate it. Erotic Frankfurt. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hello from Australia. Please
[23451.68s -> 23463.04s]  say g'day mate. G'day mate. Hello from America, specifically Las Vegas. He did the super frog
[23463.04s -> 23470.25s]  voice. Now I'm going to be conscious of that. Potato Chief. Thanks for the thousand bits.
[23470.25s -> 23472.57s]  Great impression of someone being attacked by bees.
[23479.10s -> 23487.23s]  Oh, I want to see that clip. Somebody give me the clip of the Tasmanian Devil. I want to hear it.
[23487.23s -> 23493.80s]  I want to see how close it was. Does anybody have it? Also, can't wait for you guys to,
[23494.52s -> 23499.88s]  every time we get raided, to have a perfect clip of this. But when anytime somebody raids
[23499.88s -> 23503.48s]  us or a new community comes in to say hello, can't wait for this to be with your shoulders.
[23503.48s -> 23527.63s]  Actually, not that bad. That's actually, it was a little too high though. I think it was too high.
[23536.33s -> 23541.63s]  No, I'm not trying again. No, I can't go all in right now. It'll be embarrassing.
[23544.06s -> 23552.64s]  Hey, I've been attacked by bees. Apple Shift. Thanks for the 250. Yo, you planning on doing
[23552.64s -> 23560.78s]  any conventions this year? Not this year. No, not until probably TwitchCon. I think I'm only
[23560.78s -> 23569.39s]  going to TwitchCon. I have no plans on going to E3. I have no plans on going anywhere in the
[23569.39s -> 23578.20s]  immediate future. Any packs. TwitchCon's the next thing that's in the radar here. DexCon delayed.
[23585.61s -> 23590.84s]  Yeah, now it'll be embarrassing. We already talked about this if you weren't here before.
[23592.46s -> 23598.38s]  If you do a Tasmanian Devil impression, if you don't go fucking as hard as you possibly can,
[23598.38s -> 23604.17s]  it's going to be embarrassing. It's zero and a hundred. If you don't go to a hundred,
[23604.97s -> 23609.45s]  it's going to be like, whoa, that was horrible and embarrassing. I'm embarrassed for you.
[23609.45s -> 23621.50s]  Trust me. I know. It was still embarrassing. Not for me. Hey, Sir Canine. Thanks for the 250.
[23621.50s -> 23626.86s]  My face when Jerma makes the short jokes himself by celebrating that he can reach high things when
[23626.86s -> 23633.34s]  he gets a ladder. Feels bad, man. It's Chibi-Robo. You're as big as eight thimbles stacked on top
[23633.34s -> 23640.35s]  of each other. Of course I'm going to be making references about being smaller. Sir Canine, thanks
[23640.35s -> 23645.39s]  for the 250. Local Chibi streamer loses it over a Chibi children's game while drinking Chibi Cola
[23645.39s -> 23654.00s]  and giving out free Chibi Winx. Thanks. Styx Renegade, thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma,
[23654.00s -> 23659.61s]  haven't cheered in a while. Trying to save cash for some incoming car troubles in a furry convention.
[23659.61s -> 23663.79s]  All right. Turns out the car trouble wasn't as bad, so I'm passing a few of my savings on to you.
[23664.43s -> 23671.26s]  Also, three fucking years I've been subbed. It's a long ass time. What's that three-year sub badge?
[23671.26s -> 23676.56s]  Where's the three-year sub badge? Yeah, I know. Also, Crash Team Racing, Nitro-Fueled,
[23676.56s -> 23681.44s]  and Burger King Xbox 360 games. When are you going to play them? Also, Draw My Fursona.
[23683.52s -> 23692.01s]  I'm busy, but I'll probably get this Burger King games. I'll do them all in like 20 minutes or
[23692.01s -> 23708.51s]  something. You could probably beat all those games in an hour or so. Yeah, I've got Xbox games,
[23708.51s -> 23714.91s]  360 games. They're all good, too. Here's what happened. As you all know, we've done a lot of
[23714.91s -> 23722.49s]  PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, random Xbox games. We've played a lot of shitty, terrible, crap old
[23722.49s -> 23728.73s]  games, and the only ones that are left are the good ones. There are a bunch of games over here
[23728.73s -> 23737.55s]  that are all the good ones that are just here. There's at least probably 20 games over here that
[23737.55s -> 23746.35s]  are all worth playing completely all the way through. So, we got a long way. I bet I could
[23746.35s -> 23753.20s]  find some more trash. Oh, don't worry. There's too much trash on these consoles that it'll be
[23753.20s -> 23760.80s]  impossible to not ever do that again. What are some of them? Well, I don't want to give away spoilers.
[23761.68s -> 23770.04s]  Just speaking GameCube. I mean, Mario Sunshine, Eternal Darkness, both beautiful Joes.
[23771.00s -> 23781.36s]  I don't even want to go further than that. I don't want to go for Gotcha Force, which is one of the
[23781.36s -> 23787.36s]  best GameCube games ever. They're so good. They're going to be all done to their completion.
[23788.08s -> 23804.08s]  Kirby's Air Ride. I don't have it. Maybe I'll get it. Anyways, we're almost done with the bits here.
[23804.08s -> 23810.03s]  We have about five or six more to do. Tar Alecran, thanks for the 250. Jeremy, I want to thank you
[23810.03s -> 23814.91s]  for being so accommodating to those with those busy schedules who can't catch the whole stream.
[23814.91s -> 23820.11s]  If you didn't reuse the same joke three times, we might miss some content. All right. I'm just
[23820.11s -> 23828.12s]  I'm looking out for you. I'm looking out for you. Don't you guys ever watch the news? If you ever
[23828.12s -> 23833.21s]  watch the news, the news is on like, for instance, some networks that are 24-hour news networks.
[23833.21s -> 23839.85s]  And it's just it's the same two-hour broadcast for 24 hours. You know, I've got a cycle in the new
[23839.85s -> 23850.40s]  people that are coming in. They got to know what's going on today. And it's all fake.
[23854.46s -> 23867.47s]  Play Ill Bleed. I actually tried to track a copy of Ill Bleed down for the Dreamcast. Did I play
[23867.47s -> 23882.27s]  that? Did I get one? No, that's a different game. Sir Canine, thanks for the 250. FocalStreamer
[23882.27s -> 23887.47s]  lists games he has promised to keep playing to chat with literally no intention of ever playing
[23887.47s -> 23897.26s]  them again. This dude is fricked. James O'Byrne, thanks for the 300 bits. Doc 3660, thanks for the
[23897.26s -> 23903.53s]  250. My mom just asked why her 22-year-old son is watching a 35-year-old play a 15-year-old game
[23903.53s -> 23908.17s]  meant for seven-year-olds on a 19-year-old console for over six hours in 2020 when he should be
[23908.17s -> 23912.57s]  studying six hours for his arts degree so he can work eight hours a day at a Burger King for 30
[23912.57s -> 23934.30s]  years until he dies. Damn. Holy shit. That was fucking crazy. You're laughing? Yeah, because
[23934.30s -> 23941.90s]  that was a crafted comment. That was a carefully crafted, like, okay, I opened up the jar at the
[23941.90s -> 23949.18s]  candle store and smelled the fresh clean vanilla laundry one. You know what I mean? Like,
[23949.18s -> 23957.60s]  ooh, put the cover back on. That was like fucking, that was worth sniffing. It was crafted.
[23958.24s -> 23973.44s]  Thank you, Doc. The 250. I'm gonna keep that one. I might buy that one. I might, you know,
[23974.24s -> 23981.29s]  I might buy that candle and smell it once on the ride home in the passenger seat while somebody's
[23981.29s -> 23987.56s]  driving. Just like, oh, yeah, that's the right way to use this. And I don't ever light it once. The
[23987.56s -> 23996.46s]  candle has never used. In fact, six months go by and I don't even know where it is. And no one
[23996.46s -> 24005.50s]  knows where it is. Four years go by, moving out of the house. You find it in a closet and you go,
[24005.98s -> 24015.84s]  whoa, holy shit. Yeah, I remember we got this. Oh, it smells good. Pack that. You pack it up.
[24015.84s -> 24020.81s]  Goes into a box. Six more months go by. It's still in the box that you moved with.
[24021.37s -> 24046.33s]  And the cycle repeats until you die. Put that on a shirt. Pass it to your career. No music. Oh,
[24046.33s -> 24056.52s]  what the monk. Hey, whatever it is. Hey, thanks, Doc. That was a great comment. Smelly boy. Thanks
[24056.52s -> 24062.60s]  for the 250, smelly boy. Picking up on the Alfredo talk from yesterday. I contend that
[24062.60s -> 24069.40s]  spaghetti noodles outperform fettuccine as Alfredo noodles. They're easier to come across and easier
[24069.40s -> 24075.95s]  to eat with a spoon and fork. Also, do you prefer the chicken in your Alfredo noodles breaded or
[24075.95s -> 24085.90s]  bare breaded? Breaded thinly sliced. Fettuccine soaks up more of, fettuccine soaks up way more of
[24085.90s -> 24091.60s]  the sauce and juices. You get way more sauce per bite. The spaghetti falls right off the bone
[24091.60s -> 24099.39s]  on the spaghetti. You know what I mean? Breaded. Yeah, breaded. Oh, yeah. Just thinly breaded.
[24099.39s -> 24103.47s]  Thinly breaded. I'm not talking about like fried chicken. I'm talking thin,
[24103.47s -> 24115.45s]  little bit flour, just thinly crisp. Thinly crisp. That's it. Thin. Tar Alecran, thanks for
[24115.45s -> 24119.69s]  the 250. Jerma, when are you gonna play some Shenmue? I remember asking ages ago when you
[24119.69s -> 24124.33s]  were playing Dreamcast games and you assured me that it would be soon. And here I am paying
[24124.33s -> 24133.77s]  another $2.50 for my hard-earned dough to call you out to fulfill your oath. I own them. I bought
[24133.77s -> 24139.21s]  them on PC. The reason why I didn't play them is because they were coming out. They hadn't come out
[24139.21s -> 24144.65s]  on PC yet, right? Or at least what, two didn't? They remade them or something? Like three was coming
[24144.65s -> 24147.69s]  out. So I was like, no, you know, I'm just gonna wait till three comes out and then I'll do them
[24147.69s -> 24152.65s]  all. And then they took a long time. And then it came out and then three wasn't very good,
[24153.13s -> 24159.96s]  from what I hear. And then I was like, wait, oh, shit, this is not very good.
[24159.96s -> 24168.68s]  Well, and then I remember, wait, two and one aren't even very good. They're like 180-hour long games.
[24168.68s -> 24176.67s]  And I was like, wait, fuck. But they are. I remember playing Shenmue 1 and had fun.
[24177.31s -> 24188.20s]  Like, you drive around in a forklift for 12 hours. Yeah, wait, do I want to play that? Maybe. Maybe.
[24188.20s -> 24192.76s]  That was fun. It was fun. Joel's playing it right now. Well, you're gonna go say hello to him and
[24192.76s -> 24203.71s]  tell him that I said it was 180. He's Joel playing it right now. Stream Joel's... Okay. Okay. Just
[24203.71s -> 24208.75s]  pretend I'm streaming when you watch Joel's stream. We're both doing it at the same time.
[24210.06s -> 24219.28s]  My spirit is there in that forklift. Anyways. PeacefulHaleigh gave 5,000 bits. We had $50 from
[24219.28s -> 24232.14s]  Haleigh. Holy shit, Haleigh. More huge, insane money drops. Pog. Thank you, Haleigh. Jeremy.
[24232.94s -> 24237.23s]  Just kind of felt like showing my love. Have a good night. That means a lot. Thank you. That's
[24237.23s -> 24245.53s]  a lot of money. Hopefully I use it well. Thank you, Haleigh. Enable Pog. No. It is enabled already.
[24245.53s -> 24252.46s]  Pog is enabled because I want to read it. PogChamp is different. Pog, I want to be able to read it.
[24254.32s -> 24263.07s]  It's a different meaning for me when I read it. Show Joel sneeze. Sneeze on Joel. What? How
[24263.07s -> 24272.44s]  would I do that? But thanks a lot, Haleigh. That's a ton of money. And right after that,
[24272.44s -> 24282.28s]  MechaMurf gave 1,500 bits. Thank you, MechaMurf. It'll be $15. You gave a shitload of money last
[24282.28s -> 24287.88s]  night, so thank you. Back on top. Love supporting you, Jeremy. I've been watching since 2014. It's
[24287.88s -> 24292.28s]  not a contest, but I appreciate it nonetheless. Thank you. Thanks for sticking around for so long.
[24294.01s -> 24301.74s]  We got Stryker2. 300 bits from Stryker2. What's going on? Good to see you again. Hey, Jeremy.
[24301.74s -> 24307.44s]  Thanks for the recognition for once. I'm donating to say that Stryker Underscore2 is a fake and not
[24307.44s -> 24317.12s]  me. Love watching the streams. Keep up the amazing content. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks a lot.
[24317.12s -> 24322.96s]  Hey, Bitslave. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jermo. I was watching your VOD on Diablo 2 and I stopped
[24322.96s -> 24335.53s]  watching because it sucked. Okay. Now, what else? Just kidding. I bought it and wanted to play it
[24335.53s -> 24338.97s]  with no spoilers. I've never played Diablo before and I'm excited. It's one of the best
[24338.97s -> 24350.83s]  games ever made, so I wish you the best of luck. Actually, one of the best games ever made. It
[24350.83s -> 24360.94s]  really is. Truly. You're going to love it. Thanks for the 250. The Dreamcast sucks. No, no, no. You
[24360.94s -> 24387.71s]  got it wrong. The Dreamcast fucking sucks. Just the culmination. That was like the 10th Dreamcast
[24387.71s -> 24395.95s]  game. That person didn't have like no sub badge. It was just no nothing. It was just a name that
[24395.95s -> 24402.83s]  just said like just fine in a Dreamcast stream. Dude, this console sucks. Everything about it
[24402.83s -> 24411.15s]  makes me happy. Everything about it makes me laugh. It's a perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect
[24411.15s -> 24418.96s]  piece of humor. Oh, it's perfect. Those games are all so bad. I know. And that's why it's
[24419.92s -> 24430.32s]  the one guy moment of the decade. It's just because I knew. You know what I mean? Like those
[24430.32s -> 24434.72s]  Dreamcast streams, some of them were really fun, but there was one in particular that was at least
[24434.72s -> 24440.65s]  three or four games in a row that were horrendous and they weren't funny. They weren't even fun.
[24441.21s -> 24447.82s]  And it just sucked. And I knew it. And like three or four hours go by and that's the
[24447.82s -> 24452.62s]  message I look over and it's like fuck the Dreamcast. That's your only view of the Dreamcast.
[24452.62s -> 24459.50s]  Dreamcast sucks, man. Well, this is what it has. This guy's streaming this shit. This guy's
[24459.50s -> 24464.22s]  streaming these games. It's got to be worth playing. And so no, these games, this console's
[24464.22s -> 24477.79s]  terrible. Oh, I love every second of it. Anyways, I could gush about it forever. Anyways, uh,
[24477.79s -> 24486.30s]  Jobbed Bone, thanks to the 250. Jerma, how do I tell my mom I love her? Go up to your mother and
[24487.18s -> 24491.68s]  first of all, before you do this, um, take, maybe take care of a few things around the house.
[24492.48s -> 24500.51s]  Find out what your mother's got going on tomorrow. Does she have some errands that she needs to run?
[24500.51s -> 24506.97s]  Do them. Oh, ma, I just want to let you know, but before I, uh, something came in for the mail,
[24507.77s -> 24513.29s]  I took care of it. I took the mail in. I, um, cleaned the windows and shit. I, there was, uh,
[24513.29s -> 24520.35s]  you had an appointment. I got, I wrote it in the calendar off over here. Find out what your
[24520.35s -> 24526.62s]  mother's up to. Make her life easier for the next couple of days. You don't have to say anything.
[24535.84s -> 24579.39s]  Reread the message. Jerma, how do I tell my mom I love, love her? Okay. I'm trying to give
[24579.39s -> 24589.50s]  advice. Don't ever give advice ever again. Bitslave, thanks for the 250. Please play
[24589.50s -> 24593.98s]  Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg and Kirby Air Ride. It's a great game. If you don't believe me,
[24594.62s -> 24609.02s]  fuck me, I guess. Okay. Check out my OC. What the fuck are you doing? Check out my OC.
[24609.66s -> 24623.28s]  What is, what's going on? Okay. Here, we'll check it out. Sure. Cool. Thanks for the,
[24623.28s -> 24637.13s]  thanks for the OC. Yeah, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg is on the list. Hey, Jake Lemons.
[24638.19s -> 24652.38s]  Thank you, Jake Lemons. 1337 for the 500 bits. Do you think, Murph, that Arabian Prince Donator
[24652.38s -> 24662.57s]  would play League with me? What the fuck are you talking about? Peaceful Haley, thanks for the
[24662.57s -> 24673.05s]  $10. And here's some more money so I can get my 25,000 badge. God damn. Thank you.
[24673.05s -> 24681.32s]  Thank you. Thanks for the thousand bits, Haley. On top of the fucking huge money
[24681.32s -> 24689.20s]  drop from earlier. Thank you. Sasha Green, Spider Queen, thanks for the 250. Jeremy,
[24689.20s -> 24695.58s]  what animal would your fursona be and what color would it be? I see slash S. Is that supposed to
[24695.58s -> 24703.02s]  be like sarcastic, right? It was a frog. Frog. Yeah, I'm a frog. Frog. Done. I already did it.
[24703.02s -> 24709.52s]  A frog. A rat. I don't know. Who cares? Mecha Murph, thanks for the 1500 bits. I can't stop.
[24709.52s -> 24718.54s]  I won't stop. Can't stop. Won't stop. Mecha Murph, another $15. Thank you, Murph. Appreciate it.
[24720.25s -> 24728.04s]  Beautiful Jen, thank you for the 250 times two, which is $5. Jeremy, any plans to do anything from
[24728.04s -> 24732.36s]  Pikmin? It'd be a real treat to watch you play one of them. Also, congrats on 10 million views.
[24732.36s -> 24737.85s]  You deserve them all. Thanks for all the laughs. Yes, there is. The thing about Pikmin, I'm going
[24737.85s -> 24745.15s]  to need some help on this one. I don't think I would play all the Pikmins. Pikmin as a series,
[24745.15s -> 24755.21s]  to me, is Pikmin one versus Pikmin two versus Pikmin three. I feel like two is just kind of a
[24755.21s -> 24761.66s]  more engrossed version of one, a more expanded version of one. Right? Does that make sense?
[24762.30s -> 24771.93s]  Am I crazy? You guys have to help me here. Two is the one to play. Play two. So if I just played two,
[24772.73s -> 24782.97s]  then I would get good. That'd be fine, right? I don't know about three. Two is way better than
[24782.97s -> 24791.76s]  one and three is okay. Okay. Only the second and the third, right? Three is harder for your small
[24791.76s -> 24798.03s]  brain. It doesn't matter how small your brain is. It's about how many fucking neurons are in there,
[24798.03s -> 24805.16s]  though. And I got a lot, so please. But yeah, definitely. Pikmin two will be probably the one
[24805.16s -> 24810.48s]  I play. Kar Alekran, thanks for the 250. Jeremy, with all the utter nonsense you play, you are
[24810.48s -> 24814.88s]  seriously turning your nose up at Shenmue, one of the most famous and storied and beloved franchises,
[24814.88s -> 24824.46s]  really. Those games you're describing are not 150 hours long. There's a difference between
[24825.42s -> 24832.44s]  cooking mama for four hours and playing Shenmue one through three for 400 on stream hours.
[24837.39s -> 24875.55s]  I think there's a big difference. They're not that long. How long are they? Like 50 hours. Sorry. It
[24875.55s -> 24893.98s]  would take a full month. No, look, I've said this before a million times. I will never completely
[24893.98s -> 24897.42s]  tell you that I'm never going to play something because I have no idea what's going to happen in
[24897.42s -> 24902.22s]  the future. A couple months might go by and I'll be like, fuck it, man. Let's play Shenmue. Let's go.
[24902.22s -> 24911.52s]  I don't have a plan. My plans on this stream are only, only the big projects that take
[24912.24s -> 24917.04s]  a few months to put together. There are no fucking plans on this stream besides those.
[24917.04s -> 24926.62s]  Zero. I don't have a game that I play any time of day. I just, each week, each month, I'll sit down
[24926.62s -> 24929.90s]  and be like, what do I feel like doing this week? What do I feel like doing in the next couple months?
[24930.78s -> 24936.27s]  It's this. I can never tell you that I'm never going to play something
[24936.27s -> 24943.12s]  because who knows? It could happen tomorrow. Is community content night this Saturday? Uh oh,
[24943.12s -> 24950.04s]  wait. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo. Okay. Hold on. I may have screwed up here.
[24953.12s -> 24957.44s]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Friday would be four. Well,
[24959.64s -> 24975.36s]  uh-huh. Community content night is going to be moved. Not far, not far. Only a couple days.
[24975.36s -> 24981.50s]  Only a couple days. Only a couple days. Would you rather me, would you rather have community content
[24981.50s -> 24989.37s]  on a Tuesday or on a Saturday or Sunday? Which one? What would you prefer?
[24990.01s -> 24998.14s]  Tuesday or a Saturday or Sunday? Which one? Which one? Sunday? Weekend? Sunday? Like I said,
[24998.14s -> 25007.45s]  on a Sunday? Okay. All right. The real date for the next community content night, and I, this is,
[25007.45s -> 25014.67s]  I screwed up some planning here. It's because I had to, I had some shit to do. The real date
[25014.67s -> 25023.72s]  for the community content night will not be March 1st. It's going to be March 8th. Sunday, March 8th.
[25024.44s -> 25033.12s]  We're going to have a lot to go through. I never plan. There you are. There you go. In motion.
[25033.92s -> 25043.15s]  In motion, you're seeing these things. Thank you, King. Why are people doing that now?
[25043.79s -> 25049.31s]  I've seen that a lot. Hey, what's, when's this happening, King? Oh, that was so good, King.
[25049.31s -> 25053.80s]  Well, I've seen that a lot. Is that like a thing people are doing now for fun? I keep seeing it.
[25054.52s -> 25061.55s]  Anyways, yeah, it's not going to lie because we're doing like four or five days in a row,
[25061.63s -> 25065.93s]  at least four days in a row here. And I have some stuff that I have to do on the weekend.
[25066.73s -> 25074.96s]  So I fucked up. I don't, hey, no plan. Nancy, whatever you want to call me. Anyways,
[25074.96s -> 25084.94s]  we're almost done with the bits here. We have a goo berry juice. Thanks for the 250. Hey-o,
[25084.94s -> 25090.22s]  Dr985. Just wanted to donate tonight. Just want to point out that one of the funniest things chat
[25090.22s -> 25095.66s]  does is when they point out games no one has ever played, but just talk about it like it's the best
[25095.66s -> 25101.66s]  thing ever. Like I saw one guy call you a four IQ idiot for not playing Stuart Little Two on the DS.
[25102.46s -> 25106.59s]  Well, you haven't played Stuart Little Two on the DS. What are you fucking dumb?
[25110.49s -> 25116.20s]  What's your IQ, dude? What the fuck? Okay. Well, anyways. Also, by the way, can you please play
[25117.00s -> 25123.82s]  Alpha Chimp on the Xbox Live Indie Arcade game service? It's off the market now, but please
[25123.82s -> 25135.52s]  trust me. It's good. I swear. Pepe hands. Please. God. Um, how am I going to get a copy of that?
[25136.80s -> 25145.04s]  Xbox Live Indie game services offline, but get it. How am I going to get it? Please. God. God was
[25145.04s -> 25150.83s]  in all capitals. You haven't played Alpha Chimp. What's wrong with you? What are you fucking two IQ?
[25151.63s -> 25160.68s]  Excuse me. Thanks to goo berry juice. Appreciate it. Please. God. Striker Two. Thanks for the 300
[25160.68s -> 25165.72s]  bits. Hey, Jeremy. Striker Two here again. How do I tell you that I love, love you? Well, you just
[25165.72s -> 25173.37s]  did. Sorry. I'm taken. Thank you for the 300 bits. Bulbaswag Desu. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[25173.37s -> 25182.24s]  Do you have a mental image for us or are we just a mindless blob? Um, you know, I have a mental
[25182.24s -> 25193.66s]  image for chat. I kind of sort of a bunch of, a bunch of small talking dogs, like little dachshunds
[25193.66s -> 25214.41s]  and like chihuahuas and stuff. And they all talk. Everyone has like a dog voice this way, that way,
[25214.41s -> 25221.88s]  this way, that way. No, I, I just, I honestly, emotes. I see you guys as like the emotes that
[25221.88s -> 25228.67s]  you're currently writing. It might be a dog. It might be a smiling face. It might be a rage face.
[25228.67s -> 25236.16s]  I don't know. Hey, bit slave. Thanks again for $5 dude. Fucking Billy egg Pog. Yes. Fuck. Yes.
[25236.80s -> 25245.58s]  Oh, w I just gamer gassed. Holy shit. Thank you. Thank you. Jake lemons for the 300 bits. He's
[25245.58s -> 25255.53s]  playing league with me from Mecca Murph is playing Jake lemons and Mecca Murph are cute. Wait, what's
[25255.53s -> 25271.48s]  going on? Well, I, okay. So you're playing league together. That's not me though. Oh, this is weird.
[25271.48s -> 25275.08s]  You're freaking me out. Goobery juice. Thanks for the 250. I'm just going to throw these bits on
[25275.08s -> 25280.52s]  here. My last donation was too long and to just be 250. That's inaccurate. You can give
[25280.52s -> 25284.20s]  250 and say whatever you want as long as it's, you know, appropriate and you're not
[25284.20s -> 25288.96s]  putting porn codes into a fucking chat room. But thank you. Goobery. Appreciate it.
[25290.43s -> 25296.51s]  Mecca Murph. Thanks for the 1500 bits, 15 more dollars from Mecca Murph's bank account here. I
[25296.51s -> 25303.07s]  am the Arabian Prince. Jake lemons was taught. So I got it right. I said it right. It's Jake's less
[25303.07s -> 25309.55s]  space M O N Z is what he referred to as Jake lemons. I said it right. I was talking about
[25309.55s -> 25314.83s]  playing league with just got back from my deployment from Jordan and Syria. So he calls me that I'm
[25314.83s -> 25332.09s]  currently playing league with him. So don't worry. Welcome back. Welcome back playing league together.
[25332.73s -> 25348.30s]  Is league getting fun? Don't answer that. I know you don't have to answer that because I know it's
[25348.30s -> 25355.28s]  not fun. You don't have to answer it. I already know. Thank you, Mecca Murph. Seriously, both of
[25355.28s -> 25361.55s]  you. Hope you guys having fun together. Off futz. Thanks for the 500 bits. Hi, have a great night.
[25361.55s -> 25369.39s]  You too. Thank you. Jobbed bone. Thanks for the 250. Seriously though, I don't want to hurt what
[25369.39s -> 25374.54s]  mom and I have, but I wanted to know how I feel. This is a you scenario, man. I got nothing for
[25374.54s -> 25381.28s]  you here. I got nothing for you here. This is, this is a you thing. I have nothing. I got nothing
[25381.28s -> 25401.92s]  for you. Have a great night. Thanks a lot. Let's run those credits. What do you say? Stop the music.
[25403.15s -> 25408.04s]  Yeah. Well, the reason why we stopped the music is because we're almost done with the bits,
[25408.68s -> 25413.08s]  but I do want to get these going. We don't need music for this. Here come all the community subs,
[25413.08s -> 25417.96s]  all the new subs, all the old subs, every sub that happened on tonight's stream is going to run by
[25417.96s -> 25429.69s]  you. There it is. Thanks again, guys for supporting the stream. Lots of you. Thank you. Thank you.
[25431.60s -> 25440.51s]  Every single sub from today. What a bunch of nerds. Why did you ban that person for three
[25440.51s -> 25451.02s]  minutes? My sub ran out today. So it's all good. Don't worry. More jelly. Thanks for the 250.
[25451.02s -> 25470.49s]  Jerma, I'm going to go see Blade in Brooklyn in May. Can I get a win? A W. What? I guess.
[25471.05s -> 25474.73s]  Is the movie any good? I don't know. We'll see. Thanks for the 250.
[25478.88s -> 25489.08s]  A bit slave. It's like just came in with 50 more dollars. 5000 bits going nuts on the bits here.
[25489.08s -> 25493.88s]  They say support the troops stream at Mecha Mervin. I need you to play League of Legends.
[25493.88s -> 25499.60s]  Also, the gamer drink of the day is Guinness. Good smooth beer. Drink it now if you're of age.
[25499.60s -> 25504.72s]  Remember to game on gamers. Game the F on also four more days and I'm unbanned from leagues.
[25504.72s -> 25512.08s]  Can we get some fucking pogs in the chat? LOL Tyler1 sponsored this message. I don't think he
[25512.08s -> 25524.51s]  did. He's drinking again. He's drunk again. Don't play League drunk. That's the number one thing.
[25524.51s -> 25531.61s]  Don't do it. Guinness. No, I don't drink Guinness. It's liquid bread. Not for me.
[25532.17s -> 25546.78s]  I can't play League. I'm not playing League. It's not going to happen.
[25547.58s -> 25552.46s]  It's not going to happen. I'm never going to play League. It's never going to happen. I'm sorry.
[25552.46s -> 25558.59s]  German only drinks wine. I mean, I like wine. Red wine. It's fucking good for you. Polyphenols.
[25559.23s -> 25571.61s]  Any polyphenols in liquid fucking sourdough? I don't think so. Thanks a lot for the 5000
[25571.61s -> 25585.80s]  bits though, Bitslave. Really. More jelly. Thanks for the yardie. Did it? That's it. Good for you,
[25585.80s -> 25603.34s]  you wino. Wino. Bitslave. 1500 bits right at the very end. 15 dollars. German, you make me cry if
[25603.34s -> 25611.88s]  I saw one game as Grandpa Diarrhea running down mid. Was that my name in League? My name in League
[25611.88s -> 25617.24s]  was Grandpa Diarrhea? Am I allowed to have that name? Why was I allowed to have that name?
[25618.12s -> 25628.46s]  It seems weird, right? All right. We'll see you tomorrow for Achieve Your Robo. Try to finish it
[25628.46s -> 25643.07s]  tomorrow. Stirr is streaming right now. We're going to go say hi to Stirr. He's doing custom
[25643.07s -> 25650.08s]  workshop balance. I don't know. Apparently he's sick. Sick. But he's not too sick.
[25650.88s -> 25663.95s]  Go show Stirr some love. He's playing Overwatch. I don't know how vile that word was to you all.
[25664.75s -> 25673.58s]  Were you going to raid Joel? But just hop around. Hop around. I never catch Star when he's streaming.
[25675.18s -> 25678.94s]  He's always not streaming when I stream. I want to say hi. Let's say hi to Star.
[25678.94s -> 25705.44s]  Good. Bye. See you tomorrow. Good night.
