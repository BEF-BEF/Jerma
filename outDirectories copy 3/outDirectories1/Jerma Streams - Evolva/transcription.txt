[0.89s -> 6.09s]  You guys even counted down. You counted down and I got it right at the exact second I went to 12.
[6.09s -> 15.38s]  It was like three, two, one, bang, live. I'm not even here yet. Give me my two minutes that I have
[15.38s -> 23.27s]  in solidarity while I just sit here and breathe deeply and get ready and talk into my mirror
[23.27s -> 29.26s]  that's right here on the left side of my screen. You're gonna do this. It's gonna be a good stream
[29.26s -> 85.06s]  today. You're gonna knock it out of the park, Jeremy. Give me a minute. All right, I'm back.
[88.60s -> 97.72s]  Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you are. Today we're gonna play Evolva which I it's who
[97.72s -> 106.74s]  knows. This could be a home run or this could be a foul ball. What do you mean foul ball? Because
[106.74s -> 117.11s]  if I don't like it we're gonna pivot to something else. It's not an immediate strikeout. Strikeout
[117.11s -> 125.08s]  would mean that the stream turns off. No. I have another one lined up and I don't want to say what
[125.08s -> 129.51s]  it is because that's the problem I have with these streams. Whenever I have a backup game
[130.23s -> 136.47s]  and I tell everybody what the backup game is, all of a sudden it's like do that instead. No,
[136.47s -> 141.50s]  no, no. Just don't even play this. Let's do that. Please do that. So I'm not going to tell you what
[141.50s -> 146.58s]  the backup game is. You'll know what the backup game is if we need a backup game, okay? No,
[146.58s -> 149.86s]  it's not a sir's wrath. I'm sorry to all the people that hate me now because I'm not going
[149.86s -> 161.19s]  to play that. I do have something to tell you though. Something important. It is the official
[161.19s -> 173.19s]  date and the official time of FTK, Favor the King, Minecraft. I've got a real date for you
[173.19s -> 184.63s]  and a time. It is going to be September 13th at 3 p.m. Pacific. It gives everybody that's involved
[184.63s -> 193.99s]  across all the many time zones to get it put together. I'll give you some very brief details.
[194.79s -> 201.74s]  Detail number one. You don't have to be a multi-sub to be there anymore. You just have to be an
[201.74s -> 212.79s]  active sub. That's it. Nothing else. It is not what you think it is. It's not the same game
[212.79s -> 221.24s]  that has been completely reimagined and completely redesigned. You just have to be a current
[221.24s -> 229.99s]  subscriber to the channel. The server is going to be shit like last time. No. The problem with last
[229.99s -> 235.59s]  time was there was only one or two servers that were handling all the traffic. This time,
[238.38s -> 245.38s]  there's a lot. I think there's like 10 servers that are handling all this.
[255.03s -> 264.79s]  Make it 20. Listen to 100 gecks. I already did. What do you want me to do? Do I have to watch 100
[264.79s -> 270.09s]  gecks at the beginning of every stream? Is that like a routine? Is that like my new starting soon
[270.09s -> 277.93s]  screen? It's going to be, oh, we're going to watch 100 gecks starting soon. Thanks at my starfish
[277.93s -> 283.51s]  for the five community subs. I'm a little winded. I ran up and down the stairs like four times
[284.15s -> 292.04s]  as I wanted to be exactly on time at exactly 12 o'clock. So I went like up, up, up, down, down,
[292.04s -> 293.88s]  down, down, up, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down,
[293.88s -> 296.68s]  where's my keys? Where's my phone? Where's my phone? Phone, phone, phone, get my phone.
[296.68s -> 299.48s]  Shit. No, I've got to get a water. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[299.48s -> 304.12s]  water. Okay. Poor quick. Get up there. It's 1158 up, up, up, up, up, up. Wait. Hold on.
[304.12s -> 308.28s]  Where's the dog? Oh, top. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, get like up the stairs. Oh, top.
[308.28s -> 315.19s]  Looking for a watch up. No, no, I see you. You're right there. So I, I, I like exercised
[315.19s -> 319.27s]  like five to 10 straight minutes before I turned this on. So I'm, I'm a little winded.
[319.91s -> 325.24s]  It's okay. He lives in a mansion.
[325.64s -> 334.52s]  No, it's just one small staircase. But when you go up and down at like 30 times in five minutes,
[334.52s -> 343.91s]  you get, you get a little disheveled in an eight story house. No, I would never want to
[343.91s -> 348.55s]  live in an eight story house. You know how much that would suck? I don't want to live in a big
[348.55s -> 358.52s]  ass house. No, fuck that. That would be horrible. It would scare the shit out of me. And every noise
[358.52s -> 362.92s]  I heard would be a person in the house. Somebody could live in your house. If you had like 12
[362.92s -> 368.28s]  bedrooms and your house was like 15,000 square feet, somebody could literally come live in your
[368.28s -> 372.74s]  house and you wouldn't fucking know they were there. They could just sleep in one of the bedrooms.
[372.74s -> 376.58s]  And when they heard you come and just hide in like the closet, Oh, okay. He's gone. Like you
[376.58s -> 380.10s]  have so much food in your fridge that you can't even tell if one guy's eating like fucking Cheerios
[380.10s -> 384.10s]  out of your pantry or not. Nobody would even know. No, forget. No, no, I'm not doing that.
[384.10s -> 389.74s]  I'm never having 12 fucking rooms. They could like jump from room to room and it would be like
[389.74s -> 395.02s]  playing hit man without killing anybody. You're just trying to sleep in their beds. No, not
[395.02s -> 413.00s]  happening. Get out. That's just a sitcom. All right. Anyways, anyways, anyways, anyway, we're
[413.00s -> 427.67s]  going to play Evolva. This is going to be either a POG champ or a frog damp. Who knows? Oh, come
[427.67s -> 435.19s]  on. That was not that bad. Like damp versus like POG. I'm taking that one. I deserve it.
[436.33s -> 440.49s]  I deserve that one. I ate my fucking vegetables last night. I deserve at least a plus two for
[440.49s -> 458.47s]  that one. Let's go. You just made a new saying. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Everyone's getting a bit
[458.47s -> 463.19s]  mad because this game's not in like 16 by nine. There's no widescreen for this game.
[463.99s -> 470.76s]  So it just doesn't exist. Unfortunately. So it's stuck in a four by three window. There's no
[470.76s -> 480.46s]  widescreen patch. I already looked. Ready? All right. Here we go. We're going to do a new game.
[481.02s -> 489.06s]  Hopefully it's not too loud. For this game, you get a team of Power Rangers or whatever they are.
[490.46s -> 498.41s]  You get to make your team and they all evolve with the course of the game. It's too ugly. Oh,
[498.41s -> 503.48s]  please. You've watched me play a PlayStation one game on this channel with like a cell phone
[503.48s -> 510.60s]  quality image. I think you can handle this. We have an agile, a speed, a heavy and an intelligent
[511.16s -> 524.95s]  purple alien. Yeah, come on, man. This is purple alien from the fast germa and purple alien saga.
[524.95s -> 536.38s]  Can I do purple alien? Okay. It's going to be purple A for purple alien speed type. Oh,
[536.38s -> 540.62s]  I can change the color. Wait, doesn't have to. It doesn't have to be purple. It can be anything
[540.62s -> 555.83s]  I want. All right. Well, should it just still be purple alien? P alien. Yes. Okay. Fine. Purple A
[555.83s -> 564.39s]  or P alien. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. All right. This is the agile. This is the speed one. This
[564.39s -> 583.74s]  can't be fast germa. They can't do that. Make this Sonic. This team sucks already. Purple alien
[583.74s -> 595.00s]  Sonic. This is not beanbag Sonic. This is like smushed with an anvil Sonic. Like smashed head
[595.00s -> 614.90s]  in car door Sonic. Car door Sonic. This is going to be CD Sonic. CD Sedonic. No, CD Sonic. Come on.
[614.90s -> 624.94s]  Do I really? This is the heavy. This was, I think this was doing all the damage. I want to be able
[624.94s -> 629.11s]  to, I think you have to really be able to differentiate between them. So we're not going
[629.11s -> 640.07s]  to have all the same color. Make him the Hulk. If I make him the Hulk, you mean like a makeshift
[640.07s -> 654.89s]  shitty fourth grade Hulk costume. Like the big kid in class. All right. Big kid Hulk. I'll have
[654.89s -> 665.05s]  abbreviations before. All right. This is big kid Hulk. And then this is the intelligent one.
[665.05s -> 679.59s]  Which is absolutely it's going to have to be me. Jeremy E. There we go. It's like I'm filling out
[679.59s -> 695.96s]  an application. Fast germa. Evil Jeremy. No, what color? What color should I be? Red. Well, green,
[695.96s -> 711.75s]  blue and purple already taken. I have to be teal. Aqua or chrome. Red. I have to be red. Yellow.
[711.75s -> 723.24s]  Is yellow. Can I even do yellow? Yellow doesn't exist. I should be chrome. Okay. Like a chrome.
[726.60s -> 733.64s]  I'll be like metallic or something. No, I'm just going to be red because I will lose track of who
[733.64s -> 740.92s]  the fuck is who. That looks good. All right. Name of the team is Gino team. That's not going to work.
[740.92s -> 748.71s]  What should it be called? We've got P, Alien, CD, Sonic, BK, Hulk and E. Jeremy. Just the family.
[751.16s -> 766.73s]  My family. Imagine that's your superhero team name. My family. It's going to have to be my family.
[766.73s -> 779.66s]  My family. My family rocks. The Incredibles. No, my family. Here we go. And I was this. The probe has
[779.66s -> 783.82s]  detected planetary debris indicating biomatter entering. Okay, I'm not going to try that hard.
[783.82s -> 788.79s]  You know, what do I have to do that for? The probe has detected planetary debris containing
[788.79s -> 794.38s]  biomatter entering the X-92 system. Untact with the debris was lost when it entered the atmosphere
[794.38s -> 801.74s]  of planet X-92-3. Twelve hours later, the probe recorded a significant increase in seismic activity
[801.74s -> 805.58s]  analysis. Did I tell you guys this story, how I used to do that to my mother? She'd be reading
[805.58s -> 808.78s]  me a story and she'd be reading like that and every time she would nod off, I would kind of
[808.78s -> 815.48s]  nudge her a little and she'd go back to where she was. Happened all the time. She'd be reading
[815.48s -> 824.44s]  me a story in bed and I would have to, she'd start to nod off and I would go like just nudge
[824.44s -> 830.33s]  a little and she'd go as if I was powering her back on. I was like turning my mother back on with
[830.33s -> 835.86s]  zero battery with an iPhone. She would turn on, I would see the Apple screen and then immediately
[835.86s -> 843.59s]  would shut off and I would fucking be like annoyed. All right, what are we doing? Briefing. Deploy
[843.59s -> 850.18s]  your team of geno hunters. Absorb sufficient indigenous wildlife to adapt to the environment.
[850.18s -> 856.95s]  Locate and assimilate any non-indigenous biomatter to for aid further analysis.
[856.95s -> 864.23s]  Use the O arrow on your compass or objective to find your way to the objective. Attack dead
[864.23s -> 869.58s]  creatures to absorb their meat. Mutate your geno hunters using the genes and the meat
[869.58s -> 875.75s]  to give them a new ability. Use the new ability to gain access to the previously inaccessible area.
[875.75s -> 882.55s]  This is a metroidvania? And a genetic sample from any non-indigenous life form by mutating
[882.55s -> 895.00s]  your geno hunters. Get all remaining geno hunters to pick up point. I promise. What did I promise?
[897.94s -> 908.62s]  I can't alt tab. Somebody explains to me. Tiny cut scene. That's the littlest cut scene. I can't
[908.62s -> 914.60s]  alt tab. What does it tell me what it says? I'll crash the game. Tell us the skeleton radiation
[914.60s -> 926.76s]  story. Oh, right, right, right. Hold on. I will after this small screen. So this is us. This is
[926.76s -> 950.26s]  my family. Are we going to earth? Is that earth? It looks like earth. But we send down an avocado pit
[950.26s -> 977.42s]  that turns into my family. Pretty accurate, I guess. The whole stream like this. The reason why this
[977.42s -> 987.46s]  cut scene looks like this is because this is back in like 2002. It's dodge. Holy shit. Can I get one
[987.46s -> 998.68s]  of those on my team? Those things are awesome. It's the most insane reaction ever. It's because all
[998.68s -> 1008.38s]  games in 2002 had like a 240p rendered full motion cut scenes. Use the O on your compass to find the
[1008.38s -> 1015.22s]  objective. Do I have to control everybody? This different, this two or three different cameras
[1015.22s -> 1023.96s]  down there. All right. I feel like this is a multi-block stream. This really is what it's like to
[1023.96s -> 1029.80s]  play WoW with multi-blocking. Can I select other people? Oh, there's a punch. I just punched somebody.
[1030.52s -> 1048.95s]  Hold on. First of all, this is so loud. It's just, I found my calling in life. It's this.
[1048.95s -> 1053.24s]  It's just to listen to this over and over again. All right. I was supposed to turn it down, not up.
[1053.24s -> 1062.44s]  Okay. Mouth sensitivity. That's fine. Okay. I'll tell you the, the, the, okay. So I had a nuclear
[1062.44s -> 1068.54s]  bone scan, which if you don't know what a nuclear bone scan is, they put a small amount of radiation
[1068.54s -> 1078.04s]  into your body and you go into this camera that looks like a jokey x-ray vision video game machine
[1078.04s -> 1083.96s]  where if you put your hand under it, after getting this tracer put into you, you can see your hand
[1083.96s -> 1091.78s]  like a cartoon underneath it. And I looked at the images afterwards and it was the most ridiculous
[1091.78s -> 1100.87s]  thing I've ever seen in my life. My entire skeleton as naked as I could possibly be was just every
[1100.87s -> 1108.58s]  angle of my body, every angle of my skeleton. And I want to show it on stream. I don't have these
[1108.58s -> 1115.88s]  images yet, but is that like term, is that TOS? Cause that would be me, the ultimate in me showing
[1115.88s -> 1121.72s]  you my naked body on stream. Is that TOS? That's what's under my clothes and what's under my skin.
[1121.72s -> 1137.93s]  So it's only when the skin is on top that it's TOS, right? Is that how that works? And muscles.
[1137.93s -> 1146.55s]  Yeah. Whatever. What about your penis bone? It's done. You got it out of me and it hadn't even been
[1146.63s -> 1152.82s]  20 minutes. Okay. Let's go show it. I'll show it when I get it, but it was ridiculous.
[1153.46s -> 1163.13s]  It was one of the most weird kind of, is there a gun? Who has a gun? Somebody's shooting a rifle.
[1163.13s -> 1168.07s]  All right. We're going to go. How do I select other aliens? Or do they just walk behind me?
[1168.07s -> 1176.76s]  Okay. I have a punch. We eat these eggs. All right. Eat these, eat these, eat these eggs.
[1177.48s -> 1189.69s]  Why do I feel like this is three of you guys just waiting for me to do? Hey,
[1190.25s -> 1198.73s]  do not punch him. What do I do with those? Wait, that doesn't listen. It was the objective this
[1198.73s -> 1210.66s]  way. I feel like I should be able to eat these things. Can I? Oh, the objective is like right
[1210.66s -> 1220.60s]  here. Oh shit. It's down here. Okay. Okay. I can't control these guys. I cannot control the other
[1220.60s -> 1232.84s]  three chat members. They have their own camera. Okay. Just don't stand over there. You see,
[1232.84s -> 1237.70s]  if this was really chat, one of you would have died by that. One of you would have died. I'm
[1237.70s -> 1246.28s]  surprised it wasn't me. All right. We have to find the first mutator. There's no way we're going to
[1246.28s -> 1254.23s]  be able to get through that. We're not going to be able to do this. Can I switch? Does somebody
[1254.23s -> 1273.27s]  else have like a power? Don't get that close. Use the fast one. Oh shit. Faster. No, no, no.
[1273.27s -> 1287.42s]  Don't follow me up here. Oh, dead creature. Who should get the first power up? Big kid Hulk for
[1287.42s -> 1303.86s]  sure. All right. Good. What did that do? We level up. Mutate. What happened? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1303.86s -> 1312.63s]  whoa. What happened? He gets a jump. What? He just changed. He can change to be green.
[1315.27s -> 1325.22s]  Greener. Did we make him greener? Okay. He's. Wait, he has a jump. Oh, he has a jump now. He
[1325.22s -> 1338.97s]  didn't have one before. Oh shit. What are we doing? Oh my God. I don't know what I'm doing to him.
[1338.97s -> 1349.70s]  Okay. Stay there. Don't move. You can stay there like that. Use new ability to gain access to the
[1349.70s -> 1359.66s]  inaccessible area. Oh, his jump is huge. I get it. Okay. What about everybody else? Can I mutate you?
[1360.22s -> 1386.71s]  Okay. That's what you're. I think it's a bigger jump for everybody. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1387.43s -> 1397.13s]  What do you mean? What am I wasting points? Am I giving everybody? I'm just making everybody.
[1397.13s -> 1405.24s]  I'm just changing everybody's color. Okay, so we're good. Now we should be able to go.
[1405.24s -> 1411.75s]  Should I jump something? Oh, I can jump this now. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Don't
[1411.75s -> 1413.59s]  come down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Nobody come down
[1413.59s -> 1433.88s]  here. Just leave me. Leave both of us. What the fuck? Wait, they're doing this on their own.
[1434.82s -> 1439.54s]  Gain a genetic sample from any non-indigenous life form by mutating your geno hunters.
[1439.54s -> 1446.97s]  If you find. What did that say? Oh, we can just go this way. We're fine. Where's the other guy?
[1447.61s -> 1459.14s]  Oh, there he is. Okay, we're good. I hope we can start growing like weird toes and stuff.
[1459.78s -> 1468.28s]  The other guy actually made the jump. Wait, what the hell? We didn't already do this.
[1469.00s -> 1479.61s]  We all have to get together for this. Oh, oh, hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
[1479.61s -> 1489.94s]  Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. Wait, I can't make this fucking.
[1489.94s -> 1495.06s]  Nobody can make this jump. No, we can't make the jump. I need to mutate more to get more jump.
[1495.70s -> 1511.34s]  Okay, good. Is that working? This is the only spot where I can make this jump, isn't it?
[1517.13s -> 1535.43s]  Jesus, come on. What the fuck? I don't get it. I don't get it either. I think that's doing it,
[1535.43s -> 1541.59s]  right? Why are you playing it? Because it seems like it's fun. Hold on. I get it.
[1546.36s -> 1551.86s]  No, stay over there. This is a chat member. This is one of you guys just being like, dude,
[1551.86s -> 1561.05s]  it's wicked easy. Just do it. Get over here. Do you think it's so easy? I'm taking control
[1561.05s -> 1577.75s]  of your body. Stay up there. Stay. Oh, my fucking God. Damn it, dude. Stay. Where's the fast one?
[1577.75s -> 1586.60s]  Give me fast germa. Where is he? Two. Oh, are we actually all the way down here? No, I don't
[1586.60s -> 1596.70s]  do this shit again. Wait, can I? Is there a way I can go up to not have to go through the explosions
[1596.70s -> 1606.26s]  anymore? Your family sucks. Stop. I just got to get the hang of it. Look, you can grow like big
[1606.26s -> 1617.53s]  horns and have like big asses and stuff. You guys are going to be all over this. Wait, what was that?
[1621.82s -> 1632.65s]  Shit, I have to go through this whole thing again. I have to. I'm going to get the hang of this.
[1639.13s -> 1653.14s]  Somebody's going to die and it's going to be wicked embarrassing. OK, I have the jump, but
[1653.14s -> 1662.10s]  I can't make it. Why can the computer make it? This point right here. That point right there.
[1662.10s -> 1676.54s]  Move out of the way. Get out of the way. Move. Get back here. Got it. OK. Do it. What's wrong
[1676.54s -> 1684.22s]  with you two? Come on, number four. Let's go. All right. Fucking leave him. Who cares?
[1688.18s -> 1692.84s]  Has he not been mutated to make the jump? Oh, shit. He wasn't mutated to make the jump. OK,
[1692.84s -> 1707.69s]  I get it. All right. Come on. This is your family. I don't all come down here. Was I supposed to be
[1707.69s -> 1726.74s]  down here? This too. Come on. What happened? I fell in a fucking hole. Whatever. I can do it.
[1726.74s -> 1731.94s]  I'm just going to go and fuck it. Who cares? I'm going to get there. I didn't. I didn't know. I
[1731.94s -> 1735.38s]  didn't know. I turned. There was a hole right there. I didn't see the fucking stupid hole.
[1738.44s -> 1748.95s]  All right. Where is this indicator pointing? Just start killing. Come here. What are these things?
[1750.81s -> 1768.74s]  Get up. Get up. Number three. What are you doing? What happened to number three? Wait, why is number
[1768.74s -> 1778.50s]  three just standing still and being exploded? What is he doing? He's on his own. He's so slow.
[1782.95s -> 1792.50s]  All right. Any more mutations? Oh, this is a new one. What is this? Nothing. What is this?
[1792.50s -> 1801.40s]  Nothing. I guess we're going to do this one. What does that do?
[1803.00s -> 1815.21s]  It's making the jump better. Usually it has an animation. Oh, wait. It is making the jump
[1815.21s -> 1820.73s]  better. You're right. Holy shit. Hold on. Wait. That's the problem I'm having. All right.
[1821.69s -> 1826.92s]  You have to accept it. It is making the jump better, isn't it? Cool. All right. I'm going
[1826.92s -> 1836.22s]  to forget to evolve one of these people and they're going to be worthless. How about you? All right.
[1836.22s -> 1850.68s]  We all have the better jump now. I like fast Jerma. Plug in their audio jacks. I don't really
[1850.68s -> 1864.02s]  know what that's supposed to mean. It really wants me to be over here. Why? Oh, give me the big kid.
[1867.13s -> 1883.98s]  We all do this at the same time? Help me do this. I need more power. Are you kidding me?
[1889.48s -> 1898.06s]  We need to like kill more stuff. All right. There was those other two monsters. All right.
[1898.06s -> 1916.54s]  Give me fast Jerma. What does it blink on one? You should role play an E3 trailer with three
[1916.54s -> 1925.06s]  other aliens. This is not going to happen. I'm sorry. Come on. We need to eat another monster.
[1925.06s -> 1940.33s]  I need to kill something. I hear something. Hold on. What about down here? What does the shift do?
[1941.05s -> 1945.86s]  Okay. What does that do? Figured it out. I know what to do. I know what to do. Follow me. Follow
[1945.86s -> 1970.60s]  me. That's a super punch. Are you kidding me? Shit. Wait. What about the big guy? God damn it.
[1970.60s -> 1983.10s]  All right. We have to eat more stuff. What about jumping? Can we jump on something? Next game. No,
[1983.10s -> 1995.38s]  not yet. Not yet. This is very important. We have to get to the first boss. Yeah. There are bosses
[1995.38s -> 2009.75s]  on every level. We just have to find something else to eat. Found it. Get it. There's so much
[2009.75s -> 2021.37s]  food down here. Holy shit. There's food everywhere. Come on. Get over here. Please. We just need to eat.
[2023.18s -> 2031.90s]  Eat. Give me the fast one. What's the point of using anybody else?
[2035.00s -> 2047.18s]  Everybody can level up. This is different. This is what? Run speed? I lose jump, but I gain run
[2047.18s -> 2052.38s]  speed. This is more jump. Run speed. For sure. Absolutely. Let's go. All right. What about you?
[2055.48s -> 2059.80s]  Run speed or higher jump? Run speed. Give everybody run speed. Don't do anything else.
[2068.09s -> 2078.78s]  Eat more. Yeah. I got to level everybody up though. Ready? Let's move. So much better.
[2087.18s -> 2095.66s]  All right. Kill everything and we're going to eat all these. Holy shit. Okay. Kill. Fight.
[2096.86s -> 2103.50s]  Why do I have to do everything? Just fight. What did I just do? I said G. What did G do?
[2105.26s -> 2131.86s]  Okay. We need to be able to punch through the wall. More speed? More speed. More speed. This is a
[2131.86s -> 2138.31s]  shitty survival game. We have to give all these games at least 40 minutes. Don't you understand?
[2138.31s -> 2148.73s]  How long it's been? 36. We've got 10 minutes. Give me the fast one. Go.
[2153.54s -> 2163.02s]  Actually, we have way more than 10 minutes. I'm sorry to say everybody. What's that? Are we
[2163.02s -> 2184.98s]  throwing rocks? We can't get in this shit. How are we not strong enough? All right. Whatever.
[2184.98s -> 2200.58s]  I need more speed. No, I need more power. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help.
[2200.58s -> 2205.54s]  Help. Help. Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Where is everybody?
[2206.02s -> 2225.91s]  Is three okay? Oh, there he is. Okay. He's just slow. This is an MMO grinding.
[2229.08s -> 2235.08s]  No. Is it? Yes. This is multi-boxing. Wow. It's fine. We can run with that. It's okay.
[2247.26s -> 2255.90s]  That's a lot of juice. What do I do with the juice? Mutate. Oh, this gave tux. This gave tux.
[2256.62s -> 2260.22s]  Fucking claws. Even I can't pretend that it was cool. I'm sorry. I tried.
[2261.11s -> 2272.26s]  I want to get... What do I do? This is going to be... Yeah. Claws. Give him the claws. What else?
[2272.26s -> 2278.90s]  More claw? More claw. What else? More claw. More claw. Bigger claws. What else?
[2280.02s -> 2287.56s]  Even more claws. What else? Bigger claws. As big as your arms. What else? Do it again.
[2288.44s -> 2300.09s]  What else? Do it again. Are we doing this? Get all remaining geno hunters to pick
[2300.09s -> 2305.75s]  up point. All right. What do you have now? I don't want you to close. I want you to speed.
[2306.63s -> 2318.54s]  Now he's too powerful. That's fine. I can definitely break those rocks now. What's this?
[2324.54s -> 2327.42s]  Yeah. I'm the one dickhead in your friend group that has thunder fury
[2328.30s -> 2333.14s]  and the rest of you just get to walk around with them. It becomes exhausting to play with this
[2333.14s -> 2336.58s]  person because they kill everything in one hit and you just, you use it as a time for you to
[2336.58s -> 2342.52s]  hang out with them. You're not playing well. You're just watching somebody else play while you walk
[2342.52s -> 2357.77s]  around. Here we go. And there's random encounters. Sign me up. Do I give everybody
[2357.77s -> 2366.87s]  claws? It's a really good character. All right. I need to actually build a good team here. We need
[2366.87s -> 2381.91s]  tank, DPS, healer, and friend of healer. Okay. Good. You stay that way. I don't want you to change.
[2382.47s -> 2391.37s]  This is the fast guy, right? We don't want claws on fast guy. We want fast guy to be fast guy.
[2393.14s -> 2396.82s]  That's pretty fast. We don't need claws on you because look, you can be the one that runs around
[2396.82s -> 2404.07s]  fast. What about you? Wait, I'm doing this all wrong. The heavy, the heavy should have heavy weapons.
[2404.07s -> 2410.84s]  All right. We'll give you heavy weapons too. We'll have two DPS. This guy is the guy that's
[2410.84s -> 2416.22s]  supposed to be doing all the damage. All right. That's good. That's good. Good. Leave him alone.
[2416.22s -> 2424.01s]  It's two different claws. Faster or more damage. Yeah. Good. And now what about you? This is
[2424.01s -> 2430.55s]  intelligence guy, right? He's growing leaves out of his body. All right. We're going to make
[2430.55s -> 2441.96s]  intelligence guy. We'll give him some damage and give him some speed. Let's go. He's literally
[2441.96s -> 2448.50s]  making shit up. I don't see at least a hundred pogchamps from that. That was fucking awesome.
[2460.31s -> 2482.31s]  Hey, friend of healer. Can you make me 20 waters? Oh, sure. Thanks. Now what? Oh, we're up top now.
[2482.31s -> 2491.24s]  Cool. All right. What is it? Oh, get all the, get them all to the pickup point down there.
[2491.24s -> 2507.22s]  I don't want to go down here if I'm not supposed to be. Yep. This is it. God, I love the two FPS
[2507.22s -> 2515.66s]  boxes. I guess that they serve a purpose, but that purpose is a little weird because
[2519.50s -> 2526.94s]  how, shouldn't I be able to toggle that? What does one do? Don't you think this is something
[2526.94s -> 2529.58s]  that's an interesting thing to toggle and not something that's on the screen all day?
[2533.18s -> 2550.31s]  Playing wow again on stream. We can all make that jump. Where's red? Red. All right. Just like me.
[2550.31s -> 2563.58s]  One, two, three. Good. Keep on. Where's number one? Here he is. He's fine. We got to make this
[2563.58s -> 2610.22s]  jump. Don't fall in. All right, let's go. Right behind you. Right behind him. Shit, I fell down.
[2610.22s -> 2617.86s]  I'll be up in a minute. Okay. We'll be up here. Just wait for me. Don't come down here. Don't come
[2617.86s -> 2619.86s]  down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Thank God they jumped.
[2619.86s -> 2630.52s]  Just switch, switch, switch, switch, switch, switch to somebody that's not stupid. Okay. All right. We
[2630.52s -> 2636.98s]  lost our leader. It's okay though. I'll do my best to. Need heels here. Need heels. I'm out of
[2636.98s -> 2644.09s]  mana. Need heels. Where are you supposed? Hey, where am I? Do you guys know where I am?
[2644.81s -> 2650.20s]  I don't know where I am. I'm in the water. I don't know. I don't know, dude. Just get up here. We're
[2650.20s -> 2656.49s]  almost there. We're almost there. Can you guys make this jump? I don't have wings of justice.
[2657.21s -> 2672.17s]  All right. You make the jump, dude. Just go for it. Yes. Nice. I don't know where I am. I'm still,
[2672.17s -> 2677.54s]  I'm still in the water. I've still, I got out of the water about two years ago.
[2677.54s -> 2687.32s]  I'm in the water. It's okay, dude. Don't worry. We got you. Need help to me, to me, to me, to me.
[2688.28s -> 2696.98s]  I got two. I got two. Fucking idiots. I have two. Come on. We're on our way. And I'm going to die.
[2696.98s -> 2700.50s]  I'm going to die here and that's fine. I'll fucking take it up with the guild leader later.
[2700.50s -> 2703.14s]  This is like, this is the type of shit. This is why we can't get the fucking top 100.
[2704.58s -> 2707.69s]  It's like Larry over there gets fucking stuck in the water and that's okay. Whatever.
[2708.41s -> 2726.50s]  That's fine. I did it myself. I did it myself. Anybody else getting hungry? Dude, I shit my
[2730.84s -> 2737.42s]  What do you mean? It's Alvin. It's Alvin. How is it? Why are they all down here? Where's four?
[2738.58s -> 2755.50s]  Wait, why do we it's out? Wait, it wasn't supposed to be. Wait, what does it sound like?
[2756.14s -> 2782.01s]  It's supposed to just be like lower pitch. Alvin and the E3 monks. Okay. I forget who is who.
[2814.33s -> 2819.45s]  Dude, can you fucking get a better mic? It sucks so bad. I know none of us here like
[2819.45s -> 2826.92s]  to bring it up. But like, I'm gonna bring it up because it's fucking annoying. Yeah,
[2826.92s -> 2838.81s]  it is kind of annoying. No, dude, it sounds even fucking worse. It's like, it's like you
[2838.81s -> 2841.21s]  ripped it out and put it back in. You know, just don't even talk to yourself. Just mute.
[2842.30s -> 2844.38s]  Yeah, just mute until you can get it figured out.
[2850.49s -> 2872.28s]  Okay, let's move out soldiers. This is fucking toxic. Also guys, remember, if you roll need on
[2872.28s -> 2878.44s]  anything, you're going to get kicked out. It's on Master Looter. If anyone wants to roll on
[2878.44s -> 2883.72s]  something if you roll need for something, you're going to be using your DKP. And I run this guild
[2883.72s -> 2889.08s]  and I am at every single event. So I have like 50,000 DKP. What a great system this was. I can
[2889.08s -> 2898.42s]  get anything I want whenever I want. No matter what it is. I have five DKP. Do I get anything?
[2899.48s -> 2905.74s]  Do I get anything? Do I get anything? Can I get some armor? Yeah, dude, we'll have somebody in
[2905.74s -> 2912.14s]  the guild craft you something, man. They'll craft it for you. It's like tier one dog shit,
[2912.14s -> 2921.75s]  but you know, whatever. Who cares? I keep falling off and they keep following me to my death.
[2921.75s -> 2937.08s]  Kill this thing. Come on, kill it. Toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic.
[2937.08s -> 2951.96s]  Hey, can you guys wait up? I got lost back here. Every fucking time. Seriously, dude, every fucking
[2951.96s -> 2956.73s]  time. Pop this shit out or fucking leave. Just leave the guild if you can't fucking handle it.
[2957.29s -> 2961.13s]  Well, I didn't. I'm just like, I'm busy. Yeah, you're busy, but you can't do anything. You
[2961.13s -> 2966.65s]  fucking know. You're absolutely worthless. I'm sick of this shit. Can we stop fighting, please?
[2966.65s -> 2974.41s]  It's not even. He's such a fucking idiot and I'm sick of him being in this guild. He always brings
[2974.41s -> 2979.32s]  us down. He always is too slow and he always is causing problems. I'm not going to be in a
[2979.32s -> 2984.78s]  guild with him anymore. What the fuck, dude? Chill the fuck out. I'm not going to chill the fuck out
[2984.78s -> 2991.85s]  because I'm sick of you having to need shit and have to come up through the rankings here to get
[2991.85s -> 2996.17s]  gear that I could use. And I have my DPS meters like fucking 10 times higher than you.
[2996.17s -> 3019.38s]  Let me talk. This is getting too real. It's too real. I have to beat the mission first. That's
[3019.38s -> 3035.08s]  important. That's a 50 DKP mine. That's an old one. That's old. This is a toxic fucking guilt.
[3035.08s -> 3044.04s]  Yeah, we'll deal with it. You signed up. You went through the vigorous application process,
[3044.04s -> 3050.38s]  didn't you? And what did you say? What did you say? No, tell me. Tell me what you said.
[3053.80s -> 3058.12s]  Look, we all went through the process. Don't be a dick to him just because we all knew that
[3058.12s -> 3063.69s]  it was going to be 10 hours a day. We have shit to do, man. It can't just be all about World of
[3063.69s -> 3068.97s]  Warcraft. I mean, not that. What are we playing right now? What's this fucking MMO? Evolva,
[3068.97s -> 3073.96s]  dude. It's not just all about Evolva. You make everything all about Evolva and it's actually
[3073.96s -> 3082.62s]  kind of irritating. It's not all about Evolva? What are you talking about? What are all of you
[3082.62s -> 3087.90s]  talking about? You know what? All three of you. All three of you. One, two, three. Out of the
[3087.90s -> 3093.26s]  fucking guild. Goodbye. I will find other people that will replace you that can actually pull more
[3093.26s -> 3098.94s]  than 4K DPS. That's right. Jake, you can't fucking pull more than three and a half.
[3098.94s -> 3115.48s]  I'll show you how it is. Fucking dick. If you beat me, you get killed later. How's that sound?
[3116.87s -> 3129.85s]  I'm going to do my best. Stop trying. Come on, Jake. I think I'm going to get beaten by some
[3130.81s -> 3138.42s]  worm recruit. Not going to happen. Stupid idiot. I got you into this guild. Don't forget where you
[3138.42s -> 3145.10s]  came from. Don't forget I got you into the guild. I don't care where you are. My voice may have
[3145.10s -> 3152.06s]  changed, but it doesn't even matter. I don't think we can kill each other. I think, oh yeah,
[3152.06s -> 3166.02s]  right. We're in Shattrath City. We can't hurt each other. That's what I thought.
[3173.18s -> 3181.58s]  No, I just want to beat. Oh, I just want to beat the mission for the love of God.
[3194.15s -> 3202.63s]  We've lost him for good this time. Wait, everybody already made the jump and I just,
[3204.79s -> 3208.71s]  if you see me on the kill later, I can see you follow me. I don't follow anybody else.
[3209.43s -> 3216.57s]  I'm fucking losing my mind. I have to, I have to beat this. That's a whaling caverns jump.
[3218.02s -> 3223.27s]  I just have to get the jump. I just have to get the jump. All right. I'm going to make this jump.
[3223.27s -> 3226.79s]  If I don't make this, if I do not make this jump this time, I'm going to gift a hundred subs.
[3226.79s -> 3231.88s]  I swear to God, I'm going to gift 100 subs if I don't get it this time.
[3231.88s -> 3234.76s]  Dude, that's kind of a lot of subs. Are you sure you want to do that?
[3236.76s -> 3242.28s]  Shit. Dude, that's kind of, dude, that's kind of a lot of subs. Are you sure that you want to do that?
[3242.36s -> 3245.40s]  I am sure. Thank you, Jake. I am absolutely sure.
[3254.65s -> 3270.44s]  No more. Give me the fast. Give me the fast guy. Give me the guild leader. He'll do it.
[3270.44s -> 3279.29s]  Okay. We're good. I made it. Okay. I don't have to give a thousand subs, whatever the hell it was.
[3291.18s -> 3295.26s]  Oh, look who didn't make the jump. Look who didn't make the jump after all that.
[3297.91s -> 3300.55s]  Shut up, Jake. I mean, Bob.
[3301.88s -> 3306.04s]  Look who didn't make the fucking jump. And there he is keeping us up again.
[3306.04s -> 3313.66s]  Take your time, by all means, Jake. I just got the game two days ago.
[3317.21s -> 3318.81s]  See, I can't do it.
[3321.05s -> 3324.49s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Give it to him, everybody.
[3335.83s -> 3344.52s]  Anybody else not care that he died? Not really. He was kind of a good person.
[3344.52s -> 3350.31s]  Yeah, he sucked. He sucked big time.
[3350.95s -> 3358.78s]  Jake, why don't you lead us from now on? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[3359.42s -> 3377.00s]  All right. Me? Me? Okay, I'll try. Ready? Jump. You guys can do it. Come on. You can do it.
[3382.34s -> 3387.24s]  Uh, you know, maybe I should lead for now and then maybe eventually you can take over
[3388.38s -> 3391.85s]  and you get, you know, your bearings and everything and everything. Good to go.
[3399.22s -> 3412.78s]  Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Okay, let's go. The streamer doesn't have to
[3412.78s -> 3416.78s]  gift a hundred subs because he made it to the point that he got to. I'm watching the same stream
[3416.78s -> 3425.64s]  as you guys. That doesn't count. I don't have to give a hundred subs because I fell off. No,
[3425.64s -> 3432.92s]  falling off is not, I didn't try to go for a jump. I said if I didn't make the jump,
[3432.92s -> 3438.04s]  then I would gift a hundred subs. Not if I fell down backwards off the cliff. That's not, that's,
[3438.04s -> 3451.48s]  we don't, I don't have to do that. That's a scam. No, I said if I fall off. No, shit. I said if I
[3451.48s -> 3463.19s]  jump, he gave me the clip. Jake is still stuck down there. That's fine print. That's not scam.
[3463.19s -> 3475.02s]  No, I made the jump and then that was over. He's scamming. Technically, technically,
[3475.02s -> 3494.71s]  I haven't even saved the game. Not like copyright. Okay, there you go. Stop watching this scammer.
[3505.98s -> 3523.35s]  Hold on, hold on to your seats, everybody. Hold on. I'll meet you halfway at 50 because I
[3523.35s -> 3532.44s]  fell. I didn't jump. How's that song? I'll meet you halfway. I'll meet you halfway. I fell. I
[3532.44s -> 3540.01s]  didn't jump. I fell back. I'll meet you halfway. Deal? Deal. Deal. Is that a deal? 75 is not halfway.
[3544.87s -> 3561.13s]  Okay, let me do this. I have to like, am I logged in? There is a, there is, what was that? That's
[3561.13s -> 3566.01s]  YouTuber kind of days. There is, okay, there is a mature audience warning at the beginning of this.
[3566.01s -> 3573.02s]  You guys have been lying to me for like a year. Non-descript civilian making up my subs that I'm
[3573.02s -> 3580.63s]  not giving. All right, gift a sub. Let's go. I'll meet you at 50. I didn't, I technically,
[3580.63s -> 3599.16s]  I fell backwards. I didn't jump. Come on, Gwen. There it is. Did you get it? Did you get one?
[3599.80s -> 3614.55s]  Did you get one? 50 community subs from Chirba985. Thanks, dude. I really appreciate that.
[3614.55s -> 3623.21s]  Five from Pugatron, five from AjaxTheMidiocre, 10 from AjaxTheMidiocre, and then $105 from StormyChu.
[3623.21s -> 3631.43s]  Holy shit. You made up the other 50. You don't have to do that. That's insane. 200, like,
[3631.43s -> 3638.54s]  that's a lot of money. You don't have to do that. That's 50 community subs from Inferno23.
[3638.54s -> 3643.56s]  You don't gotta make up for me. That's a shitload of subs. That's a lot of money.
[3645.53s -> 3654.78s]  You just gave the money back. StormyChu, thanks for the $105, which is also insane. Now,
[3654.78s -> 3657.90s]  I haven't laughed this much in a very long time. I'm glad I tuned into the stream. Thank you.
[3660.01s -> 3663.85s]  Glad you're having a good time. Let's keep going. What do you say? Thanks for the extreme amount
[3663.85s -> 3669.02s]  of money. Me and friends. He called his friends. He called them friends. He called them friends.
[3669.02s -> 3680.46s]  He called his friends. It slipped. And thanks for the five, Jamie. Thanks for this five subs.
[3680.46s -> 3694.63s]  All right, let's go. All right. Who's still alive? That's seriously, that's a ton of money.
[3694.63s -> 3711.42s]  What is number four still doing? Can four not make the jump? What's the problem? Why are you
[3711.42s -> 3719.27s]  still down here? All right. I'm just going to keep going. We're going to go with the new leader here.
[3719.27s -> 3729.38s]  What's this? This is the pickup point? Oh shit. This is the pickup point. Get on up there.
[3731.82s -> 3751.74s]  You set them to hold position. I did. What button was that? Enter mutator, group genos,
[3752.30s -> 3763.14s]  ungroup them, select them, command mode, command all, best geno. All right. Command mode. Pause.
[3772.10s -> 3785.50s]  Pause. Oh, regroup them. Don't regroup to you. All right. Group. Regroup to me. Command. Group.
[3786.22s -> 3806.55s]  T. All to me. There they go. All right. Nice. What is best geno? Command. Hurry up. Get over here.
[3808.39s -> 3844.22s]  Come on, Jake. Let's go. I'll take control. Come on. Just go. Go. I almost didn't make it.
[3844.86s -> 3860.42s]  Get to the checkpoint. Hurry. All right. We made it. F10. We only lost one. Mission status completed.
[3860.42s -> 3868.73s]  Objectives. Do them all. Killed 65%. Killed 76%. We got jump, claw, and speed. New genes.
[3871.13s -> 3880.42s]  Land number two. No boss. There is a boss. We have to beat the first boss. I'm not moving
[3880.42s -> 3885.67s]  until we beat the first boss. Employ your team of geno hunters. Locate and destroy any non-indigenous
[3885.67s -> 3891.13s]  structures in the vicinity. It would appear that these creatures have been created by some organism
[3891.13s -> 3896.81s]  for its own protection. Scans have revealed that the seismic activity relates to the rapid
[3896.81s -> 3901.37s]  appearance of a number of structures interconnected by tentacle-like roots that may serve as conduits.
[3904.25s -> 3925.29s]  Resident sleeper. Whatever. Okay. All right. Obtain type one explosive plant spore. Who's back?
[3925.29s -> 3935.99s]  The dick. Oh, that means there's probably going to be like a T-Rex behind them chasing them. Yep.
[3935.99s -> 3941.67s]  I knew it. All right. Get in. Get in. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. All right. Get in.
[3955.32s -> 3964.50s]  Nice DPS. All right. We're going to use the strong one. Big kid hulk. That name doesn't
[3964.50s -> 3983.86s]  make any sense anymore. It doesn't. What the hell is that? Is that machine guns? Okay. This machine,
[3983.86s -> 3993.27s]  this guns. All right. Let's take a look at the mutating. I can do more power and more speed
[3993.27s -> 4000.33s]  or more jump and more power. More power and more speed. Always. All right. Keep that the way it is.
[4001.37s -> 4014.26s]  What about you? More power, more jump or more jump, more speed. More power, more jump. Your speed
[4014.26s -> 4022.06s]  only. We got power or just even more speed. Even more speed. I do even more speed. Even more speed.
[4022.94s -> 4028.36s]  What about you? I feel like you've been pretty neglected. What can you do?
[4028.92s -> 4038.46s]  Is this damage? Damage and speed? Sure. Good. Yeah. That's fine. All right. Let's go.
[4041.08s -> 4042.68s]  Use speed so you can get this done.
[4054.28s -> 4078.71s]  Come on. Oh, safe spot right here. Get up here. More evolve. Don't fall off. All right. We're good.
[4079.35s -> 4087.67s]  Keep going. Everyone with me? You're doing Dexville. Is it boss time? I don't know. Maybe.
[4088.39s -> 4093.13s]  Watch it. Watch it. Don't go any close. Stay over here. Come over here and stay.
[4094.25s -> 4111.70s]  Stay. I thought T was stay. Somebody dead? Come on. You two idiots. What are you doing?
[4113.66s -> 4123.98s]  Go. Make your way through it, please. All right. Here comes one. He's still having trouble. Whatever.
[4124.54s -> 4135.37s]  All right. How do I make them? T. T. T and S for stay. One is having trouble. All right. What's up?
[4137.18s -> 4140.94s]  Fighting down there. Okay. I'm going to go to one. No, no, no. Do not follow one.
[4144.01s -> 4148.25s]  Don't follow one. Are you following one? You're not supposed to be. Oh, fuck him. Who cares?
[4150.71s -> 4170.26s]  Wait. Okay. Good. Wait. None of them have jump. I hope they can make this. Finally. You made it.
[4170.90s -> 4175.91s]  Fuck you long enough. There's a hole. All right. Who's got the biggest claws?
[4176.63s -> 4183.29s]  Three. All right. How do I get people to stay? I want you to stay over here and stay here.
[4184.01s -> 4204.76s]  What's the stay command? Group and group nearby genos. Group all genos. Ungroup them is H.
[4206.63s -> 4216.58s]  Command mode is tab. Command all genos. B? Team chat. That's chat. What are you talking about?
[4217.58s -> 4236.97s]  It's H. Okay. Ready? Let's go. All right. Now. One at a time. Don't. Oh, fuck. Take him into the
[4237.93s -> 4250.65s]  electrocution room. Don't get yourself killed. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Just go. Go.
[4250.65s -> 4254.25s]  Go. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. And go.
[4256.26s -> 4267.77s]  The neg? Can I pick this egg up? What's it doing? Is it healing me? I think it's a heal.
[4268.41s -> 4281.94s]  Oh, this is the explosive. How do I get it? How do I pick it up? Okay. It's R. Obtain type two
[4281.94s -> 4289.99s]  explosive. Oh, shit. Can I pick up these little guys? All right. Let's go back through here.
[4289.99s -> 4299.96s]  Is this a Dreamcast game? Yeah. Go this way. All right. What happens if we. Is it fall damage?
[4301.59s -> 4311.27s]  Yep. It's quite a lot actually. Well, we're going to lose the leader again.
[4313.77s -> 4325.77s]  Dreamcast fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. Favorite comment ever. I think I can level up
[4325.77s -> 4335.22s]  again. Chuck E. Cheese is streaming fall guides. Yeah, I know. I know. It's a guy in a Chuck E.
[4335.22s -> 4340.26s]  Look, you had my attention at first when you said it was Chuck E. Cheese, but it's not the 3D
[4340.26s -> 4346.50s]  animated Chuck E. Cheese. It's a guy in a Chuck E. Cheese costume opening his mouth every so often.
[4346.50s -> 4351.22s]  Like if it was the 3D animated Chuck E. Cheese and he had like a guy talking for him and stuff.
[4361.34s -> 4377.80s]  VTuber Chuck. VTuber Chuck E. Cheese. Kill this thing. We need more damage.
[4378.12s -> 4387.70s]  Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Eating the explosions. Just back away when they get like that.
[4388.34s -> 4396.50s]  Okay. I gotta level up. Let's go with one. What do you got? This is new. I don't know if that is.
[4396.50s -> 4401.22s]  Okay. This game just got cool. This is becoming a cool game now. I can breathe fire out of my mouth.
[4402.90s -> 4414.60s]  Yeah. Oh, I'll take it. Okay. What about new? New two. Shit. Is that? Okay. No. Okay. Oh,
[4414.60s -> 4421.32s]  you can do them all. I don't have to get out of the menu. What's this one? Is this fire?
[4422.20s -> 4438.42s]  What is that? That's not fire. It is fire. Damage. Damage. Well, I don't want two people doing fire.
[4438.42s -> 4448.84s]  All right. You don't do that. Don't do that. Something else. Give more jump. Oh, this guy's
[4448.84s -> 4475.16s]  fucked. Whatever. Who breathes fire? Where's the fire breather? Back up. How do I breathe fire?
[4479.35s -> 4482.63s]  Oh, it's okay. There you go. You have to select two. All right. Does it use mana?
[4483.59s -> 4497.10s]  All right. That's awesome. That's awesome. Holy shit. Is this too loud?
[4498.22s -> 4506.31s]  Why didn't everybody tell me this? It's still too loud. I can finally hear myself think.
[4506.95s -> 4517.10s]  Okay. Go in. I can't wait to get the first boss. Burn. Fire versus fire. I can burn the leaves.
[4517.10s -> 4528.04s]  That's cool. I'm going to raid Chuck E. Cheese right now? You want to raid Chuck E. Cheese
[4529.08s -> 4546.04s]  right now and have my stream end? No, I'm still streaming. All right. Give me claws.
[4552.70s -> 4560.58s]  Mirror. Please. They said they... No. I'm not having you guys gaslight me and telling me that
[4560.58s -> 4564.34s]  Chuck E. Cheese said he was a big fan or something. No, that's not going to work.
[4564.34s -> 4581.43s]  It's not going to work right now. Help. He did. Whatever. I used to love that place. I used to
[4581.43s -> 4588.20s]  love bringing in my report card and clearly there's like a bunch of C's and D's on it,
[4588.20s -> 4591.24s]  but they didn't want anyone to feel bad, so they gave you the same amount of tokens.
[4591.88s -> 4599.54s]  That's the person that came in with straight A's. If you showed a report card with like B's or higher,
[4599.54s -> 4603.91s]  this is a real story. I'm about to give you guys some real story. I may have told this before,
[4603.91s -> 4609.77s]  but I can tell it again. I don't care. When I was a little kid, we would go to Chuck E. Cheese
[4609.77s -> 4619.37s]  and my mother, God bless her, she would use my brother's and sister's report cards and try to
[4619.37s -> 4625.48s]  get a package deal because my report card sucked. It'd be like, well, take a look at this.
[4627.56s -> 4631.32s]  This kid's got straight A's. This kid's got straight A's and B's. I think that's okay.
[4631.88s -> 4638.33s]  We deserve the tokens. I was sitting there just like with my finger in my nose. I don't do good
[4638.33s -> 4644.82s]  in math. It was like a 17-year-old behind the counter. He's not going to be like, well,
[4645.62s -> 4656.55s]  he didn't have exactly a 3.0. We think they care? No. What? Of course not. All right, let's get
[4656.55s -> 4667.24s]  fast, Jerma. Let's burn, Jerma. Burn, Jerma. I don't like the fire. These ones hate it.
[4667.96s -> 4689.37s]  Anybody level up yet? Jerma, look. That kind hates ice and fire. Three is about to die.
[4690.17s -> 4700.22s]  Three's dead. Two hits. Does anybody have a heal? Where's the healer? Somebody help me. Save me.
[4700.22s -> 4723.69s]  Save me. Where's two? Uh-oh, two's almost dead too. Jerma, don't look. The link sucks. Does it?
[4723.69s -> 4734.55s]  What? Anybody level up again? Yep. All right. This is fire. Yeah, more fire. More firepower.
[4735.37s -> 4741.48s]  More firepower. I don't know what the hell this person's doing, but should we give them the claws
[4741.48s -> 4746.73s]  back? No, let's make this fast jumping guy. He doesn't do any damage. That makes sense.
[4747.77s -> 4751.61s]  You need to have your one scout on the team, right? And this is...
[4754.90s -> 4762.58s]  You're going to have to be DPS now because we lost the other guy. All right. Yeah, four is DPS.
[4762.66s -> 4778.68s]  Look, chat. There's no way I'm not going to cut my hand off. What the hell is this? What the hell is
[4778.68s -> 4786.62s]  that? What's the point of writing that? Wait, didn't three have a... Combine type one and type two to
[4786.62s -> 4795.77s]  create an explosive. Uh, where's the other egg? Wasn't three carrying the egg? Okay, thank God.
[4795.77s -> 4809.38s]  Wait, combine the two of them. How do I combine the eggs? I think it'll just do it automatically?
[4809.38s -> 4823.21s]  Germa, it's real. All right. If this link is not at least a seven or eight out of ten,
[4823.21s -> 4830.84s]  I'll be very upset with you guys. If this link is not at least a seven out of ten,
[4830.84s -> 4845.80s]  I have an issue. Fuck you, cheese. Yeah, I'm a fan of Germa and love him. Is that doctor? Is that
[4845.80s -> 4854.49s]  real? Is this a doctored image? Wait, is this actually the... Hold on. I got to be careful
[4854.49s -> 4859.48s]  here because... Let me show you. Let me show you. This is important. We have to discuss this.
[4866.02s -> 4871.22s]  Did somebody just make this account and start broadcasting and then screencap it or fake it?
[4871.22s -> 4876.66s]  Or is this the real account? That's real? So this must mean I must get infinite tokens at every
[4876.66s -> 4886.42s]  Chuck E. Cheese I ever go to. That has to be what it means. Can I just show this at any Chuck E.
[4886.42s -> 4893.05s]  Cheese and be like, hey, yeah, I mean, you know, so act like it's a report card. Let's go.
[4893.05s -> 4906.84s]  Of Germa and Chuck E. Cheese crossover. I don't want... Okay. Chuck E. Cheese was awesome.
[4906.84s -> 4912.86s]  It was such a fun place to be when you were a kid. Did I just say the tagline? No, it's where a kid
[4912.86s -> 4922.17s]  can be a kid. Is that Toys R' Us? What is it? What's the tagline? But 35 year old man doing a
[4922.17s -> 4927.32s]  collab with Chuck E. Cheese. Well, I don't know what we would do there. What does that mean?
[4928.73s -> 4940.81s]  And that wouldn't be kind of a little weird. It would. But how would you do that? I don't
[4940.81s -> 4950.82s]  know if I... Look, okay, unless I have like a niece or a nephew with me at 35. I'm not going
[4950.82s -> 4959.19s]  into Chuck E. Cheese, guys. I'm not going there for the pizza. What would I do? What would it be?
[4959.19s -> 4969.14s]  Why would I be in there? You're a loser. Why? Why not? Because it's where a kid can be a kid.
[4969.14s -> 4976.12s]  Not where a 35 year old man can be a 35 year old man. We have enough bowling alleys, guys,
[4976.12s -> 5011.27s]  but you're a kid inside. He drowned. So he just pushed my head under water. Don't tell him, guys.
[5011.27s -> 5019.30s]  I'm right behind him. He streams in a bathtub. He streams in a four foot deep pool. The computer
[5019.30s -> 5028.14s]  is up on one of those weird rafts. I just dunked his ass. Can I get some plus twos? And I come back
[5028.14s -> 5048.76s]  up and like, oh, what the fuck, man? I wasn't ready for that. What is it where a kid can be a kid?
[5048.76s -> 5059.56s]  What is that from? And why do these guys only have eyeballs now? DPS? Nobody's just lost.
[5068.79s -> 5078.63s]  Will you fight it? Chuck E. Cheese has blackjack now. Can you imagine a bunch of like little kids
[5080.10s -> 5085.14s]  sitting around playing blackjack? And the dealer would have to be a kid too. That's the only way
[5085.14s -> 5096.52s]  that would work. That's the only way this works for me. Sorry, sir. You busted. Oh, no. Oh, man.
[5098.98s -> 5107.70s]  21. I got blackjack. That's right, kids. Come on in to Chuck E. Cheese. We've got all your
[5107.70s -> 5119.40s]  favorite slots. Blackjack. Poker. And they give Chuck E. Cheese like a big gold tooth.
[5119.40s -> 5128.86s]  And he smiles. Come on in, kids. He leans in and is in his teeth. He pulls back his mouth and smiles.
[5128.86s -> 5137.26s]  Deep. Ding. Right into the camera. This guy's not strong enough to break this. No, we need fire guy.
[5137.82s -> 5160.25s]  In fact, fire guy's the only guy that's good. Kids out of blackjack table. Things that you should
[5160.25s -> 5174.36s]  never see. Wait, Chuck E. Cheese. What? Hold on. What does this say? I need to read this. Apparently,
[5174.36s -> 5181.88s]  this is... God damn it. It was all a fucking lie. It was all a lie. It was all a lie. It was all a
[5181.88s -> 5187.51s]  lie. This is all a doctored lie. The whole thing. I got, I got gaslit again. Again,
[5187.51s -> 5195.30s]  it happens every stream. It happens every single stream. It's a fake account. It's a fake fucking
[5195.30s -> 5199.62s]  account. You put the stupid fucking thing on here. Of course you did. Yeah. Chuck E. Cheese would
[5199.62s -> 5207.40s]  never say something like that. Got my hopes up so bad. Chuck E. Cheese would never say that.
[5209.45s -> 5214.63s]  I can't believe it. I knew it too, because I'm like, yeah, you could have just like made this in
[5214.63s -> 5222.46s]  10 seconds. Chuck E. Cheese holds himself to a much higher standard than that. It's real. It's not real.
[5222.46s -> 5232.06s]  Chuck E. Cheese does not ask me if I eat ass. Chuck E. Cheese did not say that. I, I am absolutely
[5232.06s -> 5237.77s]  positive about this. If I've, if I've been positive of anything in my whole life, ever, it's that
[5237.77s -> 5250.06s]  Chuck E. Cheese did not ask if you eat ass. There's not a chance. Like, you could tell me,
[5250.06s -> 5255.69s]  look behind you, dude, there's an alien spaceship that's about to just drop fucking beams of light
[5255.69s -> 5259.82s]  of death onto us. And I would be like, yeah, that's probably more, that would probably happen.
[5260.30s -> 5266.42s]  That's accurate. I'm okay with that. That's fine. Sure. Whatever. That's more able to happen than a
[5266.42s -> 5280.70s]  do you eat ass Chuck E. Cheese comment. I like, I didn't even believe it either. I believed it for
[5280.70s -> 5296.82s]  like 10 seconds. Check the VOD. What lucky T on the VOD. At some point you see him reach over to
[5296.82s -> 5313.91s]  his keyboard and just start like enter. Wait, don't go that way. We still have fast guy. Yep.
[5314.47s -> 5330.62s]  Oh, we have to blow something up in chat. He's not in chat. He's busy playing fall guys and
