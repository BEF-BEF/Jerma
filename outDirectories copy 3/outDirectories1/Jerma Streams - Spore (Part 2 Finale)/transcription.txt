[1.53s -> 12.50s]  Right on time. That's right. You guys bet on this one? Okay. So, uh, the reason I tried to be very,
[12.50s -> 19.93s]  very on time today, because I- I don't know, I thought people were betting on this. So I freaked
[19.93s -> 25.78s]  out like two, three minutes ago. I was brushing my teeth. I'm just like, oh fuck, what are they
[25.78s -> 32.18s]  betting on this? And I like, oh shit, and I like sprinted. I got in here as fast as I could. I
[32.18s -> 36.34s]  turned it on. Because I was like, what if people have- people have channel points on this? I don't
[36.34s -> 47.43s]  know. I guess not. You know, it's like funny. When I think that people are betting fake currency on
[47.43s -> 51.59s]  something and like gambling, I'm incredibly interested and I'm going to be right on time.
[52.23s -> 63.93s]  It's interesting. You have a good dirty teeth. Uh, I like to brush my teeth for every stream.
[66.42s -> 75.77s]  I have a nice like clean, fresh mouth. I hate the fact of having a dirty mouth. When I'm sitting
[75.77s -> 82.79s]  down talking, I hate that feeling. I can feel all individual, every tooth. It's just like slime on
[82.79s -> 91.78s]  it. And I can, like, my breath is heavy and dense. Blah. I hate it. Especially when you're talking,
[91.78s -> 101.37s]  you can like, you can feel that heavy air. Blah. Get rid of it. I hate it. Brush your teeth on
[101.37s -> 138.26s]  stream. I just did. All right, give me a sec. Beer back. Gonna tweet this. Did I get that right?
[138.90s -> 145.40s]  Okay. I don't know why, but for some reason, I thought I spelled my Twitch channel wrong.
[145.40s -> 188.38s]  Where are my headphones? Fuck. Hold on. I'll be right back. All right, I got it. So today,
[188.38s -> 192.92s]  we are going to play, uh, probably the remainder of what we're going to do in Spore.
[195.40s -> 205.80s]  Can I hear anything? Let me see. Hold on. I can't hear anything. There we go. All right,
[205.80s -> 212.94s]  and now I can hear you. You're not even talking. Oh, now I can hear you. Uh, yeah, we're gonna play
[212.94s -> 223.94s]  Spore. What is this title, bro? Uh, that's Jeremiah 420. It's, I don't know. We were in
[223.94s -> 230.25s]  pre-stream and somebody thought it was a good idea. It makes sense. I guess it's perfect for today.
[232.82s -> 244.94s]  You're muted? Do a tooth cam. No, I'm not putting a cam. Look, I am not putting my teeth in the
[244.94s -> 252.42s]  camera. I'm not putting my, like, nose in the camera. I'm not gonna, like, put my feet in the
[252.42s -> 257.22s]  camera. I'm not gonna, like, show you my elbows. No, I'm not, I'm gonna, I'm a fucking statue in
[257.22s -> 262.25s]  this scene. I'm not doing, I don't want, I'm not doing any of that. I'm not gonna, like, oh, dude,
[262.25s -> 265.85s]  open your mouth and show us, like, your, all of your teeth. Go like this and pull the teeth, like,
[265.85s -> 271.05s]  pull your cheeks out and go, ah. It's gonna be wicked funny. Just do it. I'm not doing that.
[277.06s -> 283.06s]  Anytime somebody tells you something, something, something, dash, it'll be wicked funny. I don't
[283.06s -> 292.81s]  know if I trust that person. I don't trust that. I was just gonna say, it'll be wicked funny.
[293.29s -> 297.24s]  Why do you want me to do that so bad? You think, you think that you're kind of bouncing off of me.
[298.04s -> 301.72s]  I think that I'll think what you just said is funny because it's, it's a pretty odd request.
[302.28s -> 306.52s]  So therefore, it might be funny. I might think it's funny, but you don't think it's funny.
[309.50s -> 318.44s]  I think I get you. I understand you. Play Spore. It'll be wicked funny.
[323.85s -> 334.33s]  Play the game. It'll be wicked funny. Shit. He has wooden teeth. That's why. Federal Reserve
[334.33s -> 341.64s]  bailed you out. No, they didn't. No more. What are you talking about? All right, let's go.
[342.52s -> 349.80s]  Dude, you should totally like eat a bunch of grapes and like food with your hands and like
[349.80s -> 353.08s]  eat a bunch of apples with your hands and get like bacon and hands and bacon greased all over
[353.08s -> 363.24s]  your mouth and stuff. It'll be wicked funny. I gotta watch out now. I gotta watch out for,
[363.24s -> 369.29s]  it'll be wicked funny people. I have to watch out for that now. Here we go. Camera's not on, right?
[369.29s -> 379.16s]  Good. Hey, it's like showing your desktop accidentally. Like the I'm naked. The webcam
[379.16s -> 390.31s]  just turned on accidentally of like being on a computer. It kind of is, isn't it? Yes, it is.
[390.95s -> 402.14s]  All right, here we are on the planet Zircon. Like I'm so glad this doesn't pop up very often.
[402.14s -> 409.74s]  I kind of care about this. Like it's just, that's so default wallpaper Andy. We went over this
[409.74s -> 416.90s]  yesterday. Oh, by the way, you notice how like I've dragged everything off. It's just a
[416.90s -> 423.59s]  background. Every time I know I'm going to capture my desktop, it's like, well, click drag over to
[423.59s -> 429.30s]  the other monitor. You don't want you to see any of that shit. Oh guys, I have just like a clean
[429.30s -> 434.78s]  desktop. I don't have anything. I don't even use a computer. It's just desktop wallpaper. I don't
[434.78s -> 440.44s]  have anything on my desktop. I just have, I don't even use computers. You do the same fucking thing.
[440.44s -> 446.15s]  You do the same thing. You did the same exact thing. If you know someone's coming over
[447.18s -> 452.22s]  and they, oh, hey, dude, by the way, can I use your computer?
[454.18s -> 459.56s]  Oh, okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[459.56s -> 465.10s]  Yeah, no, no, you can't, but why, why couldn't you? Hey, dude, I'm going to be like in town for a
[465.10s -> 473.18s]  little while. I'm not going to have access to my computer. Can I use yours? Oh my fucking God. It's

[485.73s -> 490.91s]  Doesn't it feels like somebody's like sitting in your body like in like is your bones like controlling your hands and stuff
[491.11s -> 497.02s]  It feels weird. I kind of feel the same way of like if you if somebody was like, oh, hey

[500.30s -> 505.44s]  I go in the fridge go like just go into the pantry sleep in the bed, too
[505.44s -> 507.40s]  Like here's the keys to my house. I'm gonna be gone for a week
[507.44s -> 517.88s]  It feels the same way even though the second bad in my house or anything quick take everything out of the fridge
[517.88s -> 527.32s]  But I don't know. It's a guy. It's just weird. It's a Zorn. It's Zorn. No
[527.96s -> 539.78s]  It's not Zorn related. Okay. Here we go. We're at the tribe of those who that missed yesterday's stream

[575.66s -> 583.03s]  Oh, I just sent them over there. Oh, here's the our friends that we made that I apparently didn't get smarter
[583.27s -> 593.92s]  This is kind of sad. Don't you think like rank and the rat like we evolved that they didn't that's kind of that's kind of sad
[594.08s -> 603.50s]  So they're just dumb and we're smart. I got food click on your hut and add a baby

[641.68s -> 652.45s]  I got to this part of spore and said this game's stupid and stop playing you got everyone did that
[652.45s -> 657.48s]  I think right everybody does the cell stage makes the creatures and has the fun putting like the
[657.76s -> 663.37s]  Extending the nose and making the head big and make it a big fat belly and and walking on and dancing
[663.37s -> 667.18s]  And then when you get to this part, you just uninstall the game because it's like I'm done
[667.18s -> 672.78s]  This was stupid this stage like in forward. So this is all brand new to me. I never played this stuff ever
[672.78s -> 677.94s]  I really didn't I did I didn't even care. I just like all I was dude

[765.41s -> 774.50s]  The tribal chieftain leads your tribe your tribe can go into combat without his chief
[774.50s -> 777.42s]  Oh, it can go into combat without the chief
[777.42s -> 784.47s]  But the chief is necessary for any social encounters with other tribes the chieftain also invokes any of your tribes
[784.91s -> 790.01s]  Consequence abilities to use a consequence ability first select your chieftain and they click on the ability you'd like to use
[790.17s -> 793.05s]  Well, I want to like make friends with these guys
[793.05s -> 797.82s]  Need at least 15 food to feed an animal. I was just you have a dog bone
[797.94s -> 807.70s]  Why can't I be friends with these guys? I mean I get 15 food
[807.70s -> 820.92s]  I want to make friends with this tribe gone go back to what you're doing. What do they eat 15 food?
[820.92s -> 830.98s]  That's not a tribe. These are animals. What baby burger? Well, I mean that we're doing over here
[830.98s -> 853.29s]  You better not feed them. If you feed them, I'm gonna be so pissed. Stop that kill kick his ass and tell him

[894.65s -> 897.27s]  I just gave him fruits. Oh, there he goes
[898.79s -> 913.66s]  He liked it. You have too many domesticated animals at this time. What is happening? What are we doing?
[913.66s -> 924.09s]  What am I doing to him? Am I stealing this guy? Wait, I'm
[939.69s -> 940.89s]  Not
[940.89s -> 948.82s]  Jim care of man on the moon Annie Kaufman. Oh, they're waving. Okay, at least they're friends
[948.82s -> 958.42s]  I have like a group of animal friends. You try to domesticate him, but you have too many
[958.66s -> 968.11s]  So wait, so I still have a domesticated bronc bring gifts to the brown village where they're pissed off
[968.11s -> 971.79s]  I haven't even had I need to hold on. They might make some more babies

[1004.14s -> 1009.06s]  Oh, this is gonna be awkward
[1009.06s -> 1014.04s]  This is this is when you order like uber eats from three different places because you want like a sampling of three different places
[1014.04s -> 1020.77s]  That day like three uber each drivers show up at the same time. I promise it's not a prank
[1020.77s -> 1041.75s]  I just wanted to read you I wanted to sample three different foods. Have we friends who does that? I don't I'm making it up
[1044.43s -> 1047.76s]  I
[1047.76s -> 1057.02s]  Don't do that. I do not order from three different places to have a sampling of three different foods
[1057.02s -> 1068.55s]  I think 85% of every uber eats order I've ever done was McDonald's and I'm
[1069.47s -> 1087.34s]  90% sure that that's accurate. That's disgusting. Why is that disgusting? That's way too specific. He does that I
[1088.22s -> 1090.22s]  Don't fucking do that
[1090.86s -> 1097.15s]  Okay
[1097.15s -> 1099.83s]  I like the brown village by playing music for them
[1100.05s -> 1105.98s]  Well ally tries to bring your tribe gifts or I need to make um, I need to make a musical instrument house
[1106.38s -> 1114.84s]  It's only 25 food. All right collect food back to getting food all of you rich streamer each meets McDonald's
[1114.84s -> 1117.76s]  I love McDonald's. I love that place. I
[1124.07s -> 1126.07s]  Really do I love McDonald's?
[1126.31s -> 1130.24s]  How many times I have to say that before people think it's true
[1130.76s -> 1138.79s]  Like the eggs you dipshit what eggs eggs
[1144.62s -> 1152.32s]  The game nobody talking about eggs. I take you take their eggs
[1153.00s -> 1165.58s]  Next to your domesticated animals. What they're laying eggs in here
[1176.32s -> 1182.94s]  Okay. All right. Let me make a musical instrument place and press neighboring tries with these horns
[1184.34s -> 1202.18s]  Mmm over here. This will be the music hut egg time. I do like McDonald's a lot
[1202.20s -> 1204.20s]  It's like one of my favorite places to eat
[1204.76s -> 1206.12s]  It really is
[1206.12s -> 1215.51s]  Is that a pizza? He's got a he's got like an egg pizza. What are you doing with that? Wait, you just have it
[1215.55s -> 1222.70s]  Where's it going with it? Oh shit. Nice. Okay. I need fuck a 44 food. What else can I do now?
[1223.02s -> 1225.45s]  One is better than McDonald's
[1225.69s -> 1233.90s]  Right, but I mean, I don't care though. There are a lot of places better than McDonald's, but that doesn't
[1234.42s -> 1239.26s]  Take away from the fact that I eat there all the time. I mean should I make an instrument?
[1246.88s -> 1263.46s]  Why not? I can't but why not weapons? Ooh, that's the chief. Oh, okay
[1266.27s -> 1274.70s]  Alright, so I got a horn. All right, you get a horn too. I'd much rather eat a Burger King Whopper than a stinky Big Mac
[1274.70s -> 1289.59s]  Yuck. That's all right. Grab a horn. We're gonna go impress the village. I need a I need the chief
[1289.59s -> 1296.57s]  Don't I? Chief come with me wooden horns. You can only use that ability during performance. All right, let's go
[1296.61s -> 1310.28s]  Who actually eats in at McDonald's? Oh, I didn't say I didn't say I was eating in the restaurant
[1310.28s -> 1327.73s]  I mean you can what's wrong with that? All right, here we go. It's time to play some music. Here we go
[1327.73s -> 1337.70s]  Oh, they love it. You like this
[1339.64s -> 1344.28s]  They love that. We are now friends
[1354.55s -> 1358.25s]  Alright, so now we're friends
[1358.25s -> 1363.85s]  We need to be allies with them though. I would keep doing it. Maybe she could move people with horns
[1367.51s -> 1373.98s]  Oh, they want the horns. Okay. I see they want horns again. I want it again
[1379.56s -> 1388.94s]  Not enough. Oh, I got it. Alright, the new tribe is your ally. They love it
[1397.06s -> 1402.63s]  I like McDonald's. I like Burger King. I like Wendy's but if I have a choice in the matter, it's McDonald's
[1403.19s -> 1408.82s]  I don't know. I just like their I like this. I know exactly what to order there
[1409.30s -> 1412.25s]  I go to Burger King. I don't know what to order
[1412.78s -> 1416.86s]  And I go I don't fucking know and I put my glasses on and lean into the menu and I go which one is good here
[1418.65s -> 1424.49s]  Wendy's I usually get a junior bacon cheeseburger problem with that though. I got a problem with that. It's always cold
[1424.89s -> 1431.77s]  I've never ever experienced a hot junior bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's. It is always cold every single time
[1432.26s -> 1435.94s]  It's very good. It tastes very good, but it's cold every
[1436.50s -> 1443.96s]  Single time i've ever eaten it in 20 fucking years of going there across states across the entire nation
[1444.66s -> 1446.90s]  Across all of the united states of america
[1447.06s -> 1455.64s]  It's like that every time and I don't know why but it's very it tastes very good. I guess i'm new. Oh, wait
[1455.64s -> 1465.59s]  What did that say?
[1465.59s -> 1467.59s]  Your mouth is too warm
[1472.63s -> 1479.43s]  Does that look like an extremely hot mouth? That's what it is now. I've had
[1479.91s -> 1484.15s]  Burgers from mcdonald's that were cold. I've had big macs that were just lukewarm in the middle
[1484.47s -> 1487.64s]  But not every time your tribe grows in prestige
[1487.72s -> 1491.56s]  You have a larger hut to show for it and your tribe can now sustain up to nine tribe members
[1491.96s -> 1499.08s]  All right, cool. Let's get some more babies babies
[1500.79s -> 1515.72s]  More babies and let's get some food big mac or quarter pounder. I prefer a big mac
[1520.20s -> 1526.66s]  Uh, okay. I think i'm good, right? Where is everybody? All right, everybody get over here
[1527.22s -> 1529.66s]  We get some we chop down some trees
[1530.12s -> 1539.58s]  We need more food if garbage tastes
[1540.06s -> 1542.06s]  I don't like but does it really matter though?
[1542.46s -> 1546.62s]  I really go over this
[1546.62s -> 1548.62s]  All fast food is gross
[1548.86s -> 1549.98s]  It just is
[1549.98s -> 1557.74s]  Does it really matter if you like burger king or mcdonald's more like they're both gross in their own ways
[1559.11s -> 1565.67s]  But it's delicious and yummy and quick and usually pretty affordable and it's really easy. It doesn't really matter
[1571.90s -> 1575.18s]  But honestly the affordable part i'm not so sure of anymore
[1577.10s -> 1581.50s]  I've been to mcdonald's a lot of times and the order like if you got like two there's like two or three people in the car
[1582.20s -> 1587.74s]  It's like okay, we're gonna get this we're gonna get that okay, and okay, that'll be like 28 dollars drive around
[1587.74s -> 1590.52s]  Please it's like wait. What how much should we order?
[1592.06s -> 1594.94s]  We order how much do we order? That's a lot of food. No, it's not was it
[1596.22s -> 1602.39s]  You can go like down the street to a place. It's not like a mcdonald's and it's like 20 bucks to eat

[4036.66s -> 4046.57s]  Let's go here. We have a gift. This is for the chief
[4052.31s -> 4054.31s]  I know we've had our problems. We've had our differences
[4056.06s -> 4058.14s]  We've killed way more people than you
[4058.86s -> 4062.14s]  You've lost way more people than we have we've had our differences
[4064.06s -> 4067.58s]  In fact, i'm not sure one person has died on our tribe, but I know a lot from yours have
[4068.22s -> 4070.73s]  Take the deal
[4070.73s -> 4082.30s]  Take the deal. I can't tell if he's trying to sneak or if he's about to wipe out this whole village
[4086.73s -> 4094.17s]  What is that?
[4094.17s -> 4099.42s]  All right. Let's try it. We have
[4099.80s -> 4101.80s]  maracas and wooden horns only
[4105.46s -> 4118.84s]  And if they like didgeridoos, then i'm sorry. We don't have those good maraca good

[4149.77s -> 4153.19s]  Don't have that
[4153.19s -> 4154.39s]  Don't have that
[4154.39s -> 4179.74s]  That was just bad rng. We'll get it bad rng. I'll get it end their lives
[4179.82s -> 4185.59s]  No, i'm trying to be in the middle there. I don't want to be aggressive into the next stage
[4186.07s -> 4197.61s]  Come on one more. I'll do it. Give me one more that we have
[4200.07s -> 4202.14s]  Shitty rng. Come on
[4202.14s -> 4204.14s]  Just get the other instrument. It's just too long
[4205.14s -> 4206.66s]  He's getting closer
[4206.66s -> 4217.70s]  Should we just go kill that thing? Maybe together we should just go wipe that thing out
[4220.15s -> 4222.15s]  All right, so far so good. Just give me one more
[4224.31s -> 4226.63s]  I just need one of the two one of the two and it's done
[4227.67s -> 4229.67s]  What the fuck dude?
[4231.82s -> 4233.98s]  All right. Well, one of you just don't get it. Just
[4236.60s -> 4240.54s]  Go get a didgeridoo. Whatever what's going on?
[4249.00s -> 4251.00s]  But that's one of ours though
[4254.74s -> 4256.74s]  He's just been sitting here eating
[4258.89s -> 4259.77s]  Look
[4259.77s -> 4260.95s]  Hey
[4260.95s -> 4263.43s]  Hey, don't be afraid
[4263.43s -> 4266.87s]  Don't be afraid. I we were you before we we know what it's like to be you
[4267.75s -> 4285.74s]  To be not because that's like an animal right that you are you are us. Okay, whatever me didgeridoo. Okay, bring him back
[4286.30s -> 4291.10s]  These guys they keep just bringing food
[4293.88s -> 4295.88s]  We're not so different you and I
[4297.21s -> 4300.01s]  Hold on the band's coming back up. Everyone relax
[4307.85s -> 4309.05s]  Okay

[4325.56s -> 4330.17s]  If it's all maracas and wrong i'll be so mad
[4330.73s -> 4334.04s]  It's gonna be all maracas. Okay, this is stupid
[4334.84s -> 4338.42s]  This guy's freaking me out though
[4342.98s -> 4344.98s]  I think that that's the tribal stage, right?
[4345.14s -> 4360.84s]  Does that bring us up into the middle and we should definitely go get the big guy
[4361.40s -> 4368.78s]  You made the cyan village your allies your totem is complete
[4369.34s -> 4371.42s]  You can advance to the civilization stage now
[4371.90s -> 4376.84s]  Your tribe reigns supreme when you're ready to get civilized click the advance button
[4377.72s -> 4384.49s]  Click here to found your first city. You'll be sent to the creators to design your city hall and vehicles
[4393.72s -> 4397.86s]  Kill the pickle. I'm just curious about him. Hold on
[4403.37s -> 4410.66s]  Hello, we can't dance for him

[4472.57s -> 4477.43s]  Did I get into the middle?
[4477.43s -> 4478.61s]  I did
[4478.61s -> 4479.99s]  industrious
[4479.99s -> 4485.27s]  Industrious tribe sees the moment attacking or forming alliances when necessary. They make great allies, but watch out
[4487.64s -> 4489.00s]  Uh, let's go

[5206.97s -> 5215.78s]  It's perfect. It is if this could be like red and this could be white and this could be like vanilla
[5215.78s -> 5266.15s]  It's got a strawberry shortcake. I win just to color it. Hold on an acorn. Nope. Can't put anything on top of that

[5406.71s -> 5408.71s]  I'll just put it on there and it could be uh
[5408.71s -> 5430.70s]  Like it could be a cherry. That's a good cherry this I think that look that could be a cherry first in the fifth row

[5494.46s -> 5546.07s]  You have to let him wait. Let him paint the painting. Let him paint the painting first. Make sure they're overlapping enough
[5546.31s -> 5581.99s]  It's pretty good. It looks better over here though. Hold on. Hell. Yeah, look at that
[5583.06s -> 5594.25s]  There's your whipped cream and there's a cherry and these are gonna be
[5594.89s -> 5597.69s]  Like yellow like a cake. It's gonna be a strawberry shortcake
[5598.74s -> 5612.81s]  I don't even care what building this is anymore bottom left stem very needs a stem cherry needs a stem
[5614.01s -> 5678.42s]  Does it know does it know? No, let the artist work you skinnier. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah a bit longer
[5678.42s -> 5684.79s]  You think how long cherry stems not that cherry stems not that long bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom left bottom left

[5756.92s -> 5767.11s]  All right. We need a whipped cream. We need red for the cherry. We need cherry red, which is like the most
[5767.83s -> 5776.14s]  Um, like the best keyboard you can get for a mechanical keyboard, right? Oh dear

[6047.50s -> 6054.50s]  Can't wait to do the marshmallows and some of them by the way gonna be toasted
[6054.90s -> 6061.82s]  Some of them are gonna be toasted and then I can't wait to hear the screams in chat about how wrong you were
[6062.47s -> 6080.41s]  How sad you were that you doubted me that you doubted me for even a second. That's that's pretty good
[6081.37s -> 6083.37s]  That's pretty good guys. Just needs to be the right color

[6647.99s -> 6653.51s]  Okay, they're gross and they stink all
[6654.05s -> 6660.46s]  Jerky sticks smell like the inside of a dog treat bag. They do they smell like dog food
[6660.94s -> 6663.98s]  I don't know if they taste like dog food because they've never eaten dog food
[6664.47s -> 6669.03s]  But i'll tell you if they did taste like dog food then dog food tastes pretty good
[6672.68s -> 6676.74s]  They stink like a dog treat if you take a piece of beef jerky
[6676.74s -> 6680.58s]  That's um in the stick form and you hold it up to your nose and you just sniff it for a sec
[6681.72s -> 6683.88s]  It's it's bad. It smells like
[6684.92s -> 6686.63s]  baloney and
[6686.63s -> 6691.21s]  And weird sausage meat and just fake kind of flavoring
[6691.21s -> 6696.66s]  It just smells like a dog treat just gave 70 so 69 community subs. Holy shit
[6699.16s -> 6706.44s]  Zap x coming in with another 69 subs. Oh my god, that's so much money

[6721.83s -> 6735.53s]  Oh, I I mean it has a heavy smell. That was quake germa. That was pretty crazy, but thank you zap
[6735.69s -> 6744.18s]  That's so much money. That's too much money. We can get back to uh, get back to the snow sticky note drawing of germ
[6744.26s -> 6749.02s]  Well, that's not a sticky note. That's pretty crazy. Are you coming to my wedding circle? Yes or no?
[6754.90s -> 6769.14s]  Yes, awesome stuff as always guys, let's go back to what we were doing very cool strawberry seeds are not yellow
[6769.30s -> 6771.38s]  Strawberry seeds are black. What are you talking about? Okay
[6772.65s -> 6777.91s]  Anyways, I want to go do the the marshmallow ones is gonna be the most fun
[6779.69s -> 6782.17s]  Is there you know, you get the white in here. Hold on
[6782.25s -> 6788.94s]  Let me just do a few marshmallows just so I know what i'm getting into and then like the toasted hold on
[6790.98s -> 6793.35s]  Oh, this is gonna be so cool
[6793.35s -> 6795.35s]  Oh my god
[6795.43s -> 6814.25s]  Look at that. Look at it. Just look at it for a second. Let me see more toasted ones
[6826.39s -> 6840.92s]  No, it's too toasted way too toasted. That's way too toasted too much. Some of them just be made out of wood
[6841.00s -> 6843.37s]  That looks that looks good
[6848.94s -> 6852.20s]  Oh
[6852.20s -> 6869.75s]  No, it's close, but it's not close enough. All right orange
[6874.81s -> 6878.89s]  Some of them get like that though
[6886.86s -> 6888.46s]  No, not mine
[6888.46s -> 6894.66s]  What are you talking about? There's many tiers of how to enjoy a roasted marshmallow
[6895.72s -> 6901.48s]  There's stick it on the stick and just warm it up a little so it's just the heat is inside of the the
[6901.88s -> 6905.24s]  Middle and it's a little gooey. It's not toasted at all. It's just warmed
[6905.64s -> 6910.46s]  That's tier one tier two is you put it on the stick and you rotisserie it
[6911.14s -> 6914.68s]  Perfectly until the outside edge is like I would say
[6915.88s -> 6919.66s]  Slightly brown and then it's crunches in your mouth. It pulls back
[6919.74s -> 6926.04s]  It's super gooey super warm in the middle and it's viscous in the middle. That's tier two tier three
[6926.52s -> 6929.78s]  Is the full on nuclear mode. That's when you let it catch fire
[6930.68s -> 6933.08s]  You just let the thing burn the whole thing
[6933.56s -> 6940.95s]  Until it's black blow it out and then you get the you take that skin off. It's like crispy fucking chicken skin
[6941.27s -> 6945.75s]  But marshmallow and you eat that first and then there's this little center of just
[6946.71s -> 6951.74s]  Liquid but it's still kind of a solid that's tier three tier four
[6952.30s -> 6955.34s]  Is you let it light on fire you sit there and you let it burn
[6955.82s -> 6959.86s]  It falls off it falls off into the fire and you're like, oh shit
[6960.76s -> 6966.97s]  And then three or four hours later after the fire goes out you go in there and you find it and it's this little
[6967.13s -> 6973.24s]  Black speck in there you take your finger you lick your finger you touch this little black speck and then you go
[6976.57s -> 6986.97s]  It's tier four don't do that though. That's actually horrible. That's really bad for you. Don't do that. Nobody does that
[6986.97s -> 6996.10s]  I don't do that. It was made it was that was set for comedic purposes only. There you go. Ooh
[6997.30s -> 7010.12s]  I like that. This looks good. I think this is the one at least some of some of them can be that holy shit
[7010.28s -> 7031.29s]  I love it. Mmm, gotta get a little bit of variety. There we go
[7031.53s -> 7038.58s]  Oh, and I I will actually scream in your face
[7039.06s -> 7045.86s]  If you tell me that the toasted marshmallow the toasted marshmallow jelly belly is not the best one
[7046.02s -> 7058.41s]  If you say buttered popcorn is leave
[7060.01s -> 7075.78s]  Now and don't come back. I was just kidding. You can stay okay
[7077.26s -> 7086.68s]  Getting i'm kidding. You can stay don't worry. It was a joke. Look at that. It's so toasted and roasted
[7087.16s -> 7089.16s]  All right, I gotta settle down relax, dude
[7089.40s -> 7108.52s]  This is making me want dessert perma band links, please perma band links. We will probably eventually links are gonna turn into something else
[7108.52s -> 7117.74s]  Probably these roasted marshmallows with the texture on them, too
[7118.06s -> 7122.73s]  Oh, please god not my links
[7123.29s -> 7134.84s]  Don't worry the cherry. I don't the cherry is okay. Maybe hmm you guys blew it
[7138.26s -> 7141.13s]  Well, the links are not gonna go away
[7141.13s -> 7147.22s]  But I want to find solutions to make them not very spammable and look
[7147.30s -> 7150.26s]  I've been looking for solutions in quotes for tons of things over the years
[7150.26s -> 7154.98s]  So I don't know that looks just like the jelly belly jelly bean
[7156.07s -> 7167.27s]  Oh, I wish I had a huge plate of those right now. Next is the cake which this has to be
[7168.54s -> 7187.35s]  Uh, like a yellow damn it. This is making me so hungry. Yeah, it's got to be like a spongy material
[7187.59s -> 7196.54s]  And this kind of looks like dinosaur skin spongy
[7210.36s -> 7214.33s]  No, this is like wood
[7227.13s -> 7233.10s]  Maybe
[7233.10s -> 7256.78s]  This could be ice cream. Wait, this could be ice cream. Couldn't it? It's dipping dots. Hold on
[7256.86s -> 7270.81s]  I need to get the right color. Reverse that shit ice cream with fudge sauce
[7271.21s -> 7292.15s]  Mmm, that's not a bad idea. Why is it doing that? That could be but that needs to be like a brown
[7292.39s -> 7309.27s]  This is making me so hungry
[7309.51s -> 7317.46s]  Look at how delicious this looks. This is actually making me really hungry. It's like chocolate and sponge cake marshmallow
[7323.42s -> 7332.92s]  Oh, jesus. I need ice cream on this though. Oh
[7333.64s -> 7335.02s]  my
[7335.02s -> 7372.10s]  Fucking god i'm gonna copy this. Oh my god a little bit more one more
[7382.63s -> 7425.37s]  Don't forget don't forget about the color right now. They're not eggs. Forget about the color. Holy shit
[7425.53s -> 7440.97s]  Okay, i'm almost done one more in the back a bit higher. There's like a two scoop right here
[7444.47s -> 7460.02s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, not good enough. There it is. Holy shit. Okay. Wait a little bit lower a little less
[7460.10s -> 7473.43s]  Okay, wait a little more a little less less. It was like the those you scoop up and just drop it on the sponge cake
[7473.67s -> 7478.39s]  Forget about the colors. We're not um, what color what uh ice cream should be, you know?
[7478.71s -> 7489.54s]  What color what what kind of ice cream's on it strawberry ice cream? Wait, it should be you're right
[7489.54s -> 7492.42s]  It should be strawberry ice cream. Holy shit. This is gonna be awesome
[7496.84s -> 7505.91s]  Strawberry ice cream, dude, are you serious? Oh my god. What are you thinking? You're a goddamn genius
[7506.23s -> 7536.71s]  No, that's not right. Should there be a pattern mint mint mint? Well, let me get this done. Hmm
[7537.03s -> 7547.46s]  Yeah, they need any texture in there smooth strawberry ice cream. That's that light pink color without anything in it
[7548.15s -> 7551.35s]  Is my favorite thing on earth. I just want to make sure everyone knows this
[7552.52s -> 7553.58s]  smooth
[7553.58s -> 7561.26s]  Strawberry ice cream barely pink color is the best thing
[7561.66s -> 7570.65s]  You that's my favorite thing in the world eating it just straight up is awesome putting it between like having it as like an ice cream sandwich
[7571.13s -> 7572.01s]  also
[7572.01s -> 7579.93s]  As a milkshake smooth strawberry ice cream makes the best milkshake. I will take that over any chocolate milkshake any vanilla shake
[7582.49s -> 7595.06s]  Man, it's so good. It's the best it really is paint the sphere. Oh shit this thing in the middle
[7595.06s -> 7606.52s]  What would that be? That's technically part of the strawberry should be green. This is technically the bottom half of the strawberry
[7607.00s -> 7621.94s]  Upside down, right? This would be like cut in half like a pink. We'll get to that in a minute. Oh, it's perfect
[7641.91s -> 7645.61s]  Shit okay the wasp nest
[7648.14s -> 7656.65s]  I'm not sure anything's gonna come closer though because that looks like you've scraped
[7660.38s -> 7666.18s]  I'm not sure I should go to anything else. I feel like this is the best we're gonna get
[7666.42s -> 7670.98s]  This looks like it's been scraped and like it's been dropped and
[7674.62s -> 7680.94s]  Make the antennas cones. Yeah. Wait, is this something that's better for a cone?
[7683.64s -> 7684.76s]  Mmm
[7684.76s -> 7701.42s]  Maybe this let's just test it and then we flip this fucking thing upside down and I flip it around
[7701.74s -> 7709.48s]  I can't wait. Wait, come on, but it could be upside down. It could be upside down
[7709.72s -> 7713.27s]  It could be upside down on top of one of these it could be upside down on top of one of these
[7713.59s -> 7728.58s]  All right, keep that out here. No, these are details. I can't do that put pistachio on it. Hold on
[7744.63s -> 7763.26s]  Don't tell me I can't do this. I got it. I got this and I tilt it. Let me tilt this shit
[7764.54s -> 7766.54s]  I can't tilt it. Why?
[7768.58s -> 7774.07s]  No
[7774.07s -> 7776.95s]  Use tab tab tab
[7777.51s -> 7780.33s]  Oh, yes
[7780.49s -> 7796.79s]  I almost burped. Oh

[7899.14s -> 7907.83s]  All right, that's gonna make the cone. Yeah, that's good. Should I put hey check this shit out?
[7907.99s -> 7949.72s]  You know what I mean? Like it fell down here and went
[7951.48s -> 7973.59s]  One more maybe like right there remember you still have four more things to build you need to hurry up if you want to actually play
[7973.67s -> 7986.63s]  What are we talking about? Um, is this too much? I think this might be I don't know
[7986.79s -> 7992.97s]  What do you think? It's like it's spilling over the side too much. It might be it's getting a little busy
[7996.15s -> 8027.00s]  Hmm. Hold on and then hmm. I need to make the cone different color. This took an hour
[8028.66s -> 8035.86s]  Yeah, sure may have to make a spoon over there. Yeah, definitely good idea. That's a really good idea
[8036.02s -> 8044.06s]  What a perfect idea. It's gonna be waffle like shaped. Oh my god. Look at this shit
[8053.38s -> 8068.62s]  Wait, reverse those colors. I need to reverse that it needs to be darker up here
[8069.56s -> 8077.61s]  Wait, should I reverse it? Yeah, I need to flip these colors. All right, how did I get to that one?
[8077.69s -> 8080.49s]  Okay, that one's like a light
[8080.49s -> 8082.73s]  No, where did I get that from?
[8083.19s -> 8096.79s]  This one, right? Okay. No, how did I get that color? How did I get this? How did I get that color?
[8097.19s -> 8115.40s]  Go close close one more up. It's close enough. Okay, and then I need this one to be this a little lighter
[8115.64s -> 8128.89s]  Okay, let's try it. Shit. Why people people bored me bored. Oh, well, I'm whatever
[8129.53s -> 8133.78s]  Look over look at this. I'm making a masterpiece. It was better the other way
[8135.91s -> 8145.40s]  Yeah, it was I want this to be darker though by a little bit not that dark
[8145.72s -> 8171.19s]  No, no, what are you doing? This top one needs to be darker. Give me like a chocolate cone
[8172.79s -> 8187.70s]  Mmm, I like that. I kind of like the chocolate cone stop building. What what's wrong? What's going on here people are bored
[8188.02s -> 8196.04s]  Well get up and do some jumping jacks. What do I want to tell you? I'm having fun making my ice cream house
[8196.60s -> 8208.39s]  I maybe I shouldn't mess with it. Maybe it is good that way
[8208.79s -> 8216.49s]  Hmm, and that needs to be so much a little bit darker, but I can't get it
[8216.73s -> 8223.35s]  I don't know where the color is to do that. Maybe no, not that yellow
[8224.66s -> 8236.47s]  This brown i'm just gonna leave it. I don't want to mess with it. It's it's it's it's good the way it is

[8292.44s -> 8294.44s]  We've got some good spoon
[8294.60s -> 8305.30s]  Potential here this right here is that's a spoon to me. I just got to spin it around and put it in the ice cream
[8314.22s -> 8319.75s]  Oh, hell. Yeah, look at this. Are you kidding me?

[8402.70s -> 8409.13s]  Don't sell why does it want me to sell this because control can only move it up and down
[8409.21s -> 8413.54s]  How do I move it left and right because I can only move it up and down with control
[8414.46s -> 8421.14s]  It's shift the other way shift is left and right. It's not what's left and right hold
[8422.26s -> 8426.90s]  Hold shift hold shift. I can't go left and right. I can only go up and down with both shift and control
[8427.96s -> 8434.82s]  Hold alt no up and down tab holding tab makes me just go up and down
[8435.30s -> 8438.15s]  Wait, hold on shift

[8542.81s -> 8550.22s]  Why did you have to do that? Oh, I game you're really pissing me off. No now you're making me angry
[8552.31s -> 8587.22s]  Now you're just upsetting me. It's so close. All right, I got it. I have it in position. It's in position in position
[8590.25s -> 8606.68s]  Almost hilt it right there. Oh, it's close. Come on. Come on. Got it done
[8625.16s -> 8640.87s]  It can be better. Oh, it's so you don't look at it. It's like kind of it's slowly almost falling off the spoon
[8645.74s -> 8647.50s]  Whoa, cool. All right
[8647.50s -> 8650.63s]  We can be better than that though. Mmm
[8650.71s -> 8681.43s]  I get a golden spoon. I'm just seeing what's available blue plastic spoon. That looks pretty good, too. I think that's it
[8681.67s -> 8715.51s]  That's the one door right? Yeah. Okay the doors. What are the doors gonna be strawberry marshmallows?
[8715.83s -> 8723.34s]  What goes with strawberry marshmallows chocolate syrup graham crackers?
[8723.98s -> 8730.50s]  Yep graham cracker doors graham cracker doors and graham cracker windows. That's perfect
[8730.74s -> 8756.17s]  We need a good texture for graham cracker though. I mean that's not bad. That's pretty good. Oh, hell yeah
[8760.66s -> 8764.10s]  And the middle here though the middle here needs to be
[8765.10s -> 8779.32s]  Um something what what is this this middle part graham crackers sitting on? Oh my god chocolate
[8779.88s -> 8787.88s]  Would be dark brown like it gets dipped in chocolate. Give it a look
[8788.12s -> 8816.70s]  Uh, so this is the chocolate base bar even bitten the cherry needs to be glossy glossy cherry glossy cherry, right?
[8816.70s -> 8832.98s]  Right, right. Hold on. I'll get you. Um glossy cherry yellow seeds yellow seeds yellow seeds yellow seeds
[8837.51s -> 8852.89s]  Oh shit, these gotta go back is kind of empty. I need something right here at the very back
[8853.13s -> 8867.26s]  How about a um one of the cherry put a banana here put banana?
[8868.14s -> 8877.75s]  Put a chocolate banana here banana, please a banana a chocolate banana
[8877.83s -> 8917.35s]  But I mean, I I guess this could be a banana. No, it's gonna curve. Oh my god
[8922.06s -> 8925.14s]  Oh my god
[8925.14s -> 8926.10s]  Oh
[8926.10s -> 8981.85s]  My god, which way should be facing like that. Definitely a little bit higher. I tilt it
[8982.01s -> 8991.34s]  I think i'm gonna tilt it a little just a little bit just to go up a little so it's resting kind of right
[8991.34s -> 9002.82s]  On it and tilt it this way. All right. Looks good. Perfect. Perfect. All right. I gotta gotta get the banana colors
[9002.82s -> 9011.72s]  They're almost they're not bad. It's close bananas are kind of like just barely off kind of white, right?
[9011.72s -> 9027.42s]  They're like a yellow off-white bananas are not yellow. They're like an off-white
[9027.66s -> 9038.31s]  Yeah, yellow and like a brown deep yellow with brown spots. No, no, no, this is not guys. This isn't
[9038.87s -> 9041.37s]  Um, hold on a minute. I think we're confused
[9041.45s -> 9043.93s]  This is a dessert
[9043.93s -> 9051.75s]  This is part of the dessert. The banana is peeled the banana's not sitting there in the banana shell
[9052.39s -> 9058.20s]  It's peeled it's part of the dessert. I just want to make sure i'm very clear about that
[9065.34s -> 9068.46s]  I mean that's already perfect. But does it need anything else? I feel like it's a little bear over there
[9068.62s -> 9074.74s]  If it's like chocolate speckles on it like it's been
[9075.22s -> 9098.31s]  Splashed in the chocolate. I think so a little darker. There it is
[9103.10s -> 9126.63s]  Um been done for five minutes one. Perfect. It's perfect. It gets been rolling around in the chocolate a little
[9127.83s -> 9132.71s]  It's so don't you want to just take a fork or a spoon and just smush it down on that banana
[9133.42s -> 9137.66s]  Take the piece down here scrape it so the little tip is on the spoon
[9138.14s -> 9143.02s]  Come over here drag it across here on the strawberry and then pick one of these off with your hands
[9143.66s -> 9147.72s]  The other hand take the spoon you had slip right into the cream
[9148.20s -> 9161.46s]  Into your mouth bite the banana bite the marshmallow at the same time chocolate on the tip. Oh, I see like it's been dipped in chocolate
[9165.61s -> 9193.16s]  It's been dipped in the chocolate I see somebody did a little we're done here it is what a mint chocolate chip roof a cigarette
[9200.87s -> 9207.83s]  I used a done cigarette. No, that's a banana. That's a banana relax
[9208.79s -> 9217.05s]  It does kind of look
[9218.28s -> 9228.58s]  Cigarette save and exit stop. Did you will you go do some push-ups or something burn some energy?
[9231.64s -> 9236.76s]  Yellow seeds yellow seeds yellow seeds for real. I but I don't even know. I don't think I could even fix that
[9236.76s -> 9238.76s]  I don't even know what the pattern was
[9242.55s -> 9247.18s]  Can't get over that. This was a banana until five seconds ago
[9247.18s -> 9249.50s]  Now you're making me want to remove it because it's a cigarette
[9250.81s -> 9254.01s]  I that's been a banana for the last 10 minutes of my brain until right now
[9260.46s -> 9270.28s]  No, all right, i'm not i'm not messing with it anymore i'm not messing with it anymore it's over
[9270.84s -> 9274.14s]  I did it. There it is the gronk's ice cream city hall
[9279.35s -> 9280.63s]  Maybe I should like
[9280.63s -> 9285.46s]  Put the banana. No, i'm not no more i'm stepping away yellow seeds where I won't eat it
[9285.54s -> 9291.05s]  I don't know where that is. Is it this one here? I gotta match the colors again. I don't think I can it's no it's green
[9291.61s -> 9306.58s]  Plus that's like mint chocolate chip sprinkles. I think they've been in a little larger. Leave it. It looks good. Yeah
[9307.70s -> 9309.06s]  I'm stepping away
[9309.06s -> 9323.06s]  I'm stepping away
[9323.06s -> 9325.56s]  Wow, it's not even textured
[9325.88s -> 9337.66s]  We're gonna make so much money and plus they're ice cream themed themselves. This is like the sherbert crows
[9337.90s -> 9355.80s]  We're gonna make cars or we're gonna make trucks or we're gonna make spaceships
[9356.70s -> 9362.54s]  See are they all questioning the guy that said he wanted to make pies and ice cream and stuff
[9370.68s -> 9381.48s]  Look at the building cars and cash no ice cream
[9383.06s -> 9389.03s]  You're about to enter civilization. Oh boy. What is this?
[9390.36s -> 9394.60s]  Name your land vehicle. It has got to be it's got to be like a graham cracker car
[9395.40s -> 9402.84s]  It's got to be like a banana chocolate car or something. Oh, no
[9404.74s -> 9410.66s]  Oh, no
[9410.66s -> 9413.46s]  Ice cream sandwich car. I mean I can do that pretty quickly. I think
[9420.87s -> 9426.28s]  I can do that one quickly
[9426.28s -> 9428.52s]  All right in the wrapper or out of the wrapper. That's important
[9430.28s -> 9441.51s]  Should have like half a turn around half wrapper maybe okay
[9441.91s -> 9443.91s]  Just so that's for me to remember ice cream sandwich
[9448.22s -> 9450.30s]  That looks pretty good. That's a good start. That's the middle
[9453.62s -> 9455.74s]  Hmm
[9455.74s -> 9474.18s]  Nope, this is the middle. It needs wheels. Yeah, that's true. That's a that's a good start. I like it
[9477.70s -> 9479.14s]  Okay
[9479.14s -> 9483.29s]  Uh, I can do this very quickly the body we need
[9485.72s -> 9495.45s]  Mmm cockpit. I think that's perfect. I can do this one pretty they all have this one
[9495.93s -> 9531.00s]  I think it's gonna be this one. They just stretch it a little bit. Not bad drink it a little bit. Mmm
[9531.64s -> 9545.96s]  Remember, this is the chocolate. Yeah, hold on just to make sure that I got I got question marks and I got like

[9581.98s -> 9586.94s]  All right, and we're gonna have oreo cookie wheels is perfect cockpit body
[9589.29s -> 9594.49s]  Land. All right. I need oreo cookie wheels
[9598.17s -> 9607.78s]  Or like whipped cream gun. No oreo cookie wheels is perfect. This is gonna be so cool
[9610.18s -> 9623.43s]  Or should it be underneath the car?
[9623.51s -> 9627.11s]  Now where's gonna okay i'm just gonna make the car i'm just making me so hungry for dessert
[9628.09s -> 9632.41s]  The wheels are gonna be big big oreos because they're like tiny don't they like an inch or two tall
[9646.79s -> 9653.08s]  Okay, oreo cookie. We'll dress this up in a minute. Hold on
[9659.30s -> 9684.71s]  Um, this is like floating. Hey, don't do that. Why is this floating? It's fine shift to move the whole vehicle
[9685.35s -> 9689.59s]  Oh, there we go. Okay
[9689.59s -> 9697.48s]  There and then this guy that gotta have a little bit of detail work. Don't you think let's get the paint job going here?
[9699.77s -> 9701.29s]  All right, so it's
[9701.29s -> 9706.79s]  Let's get the let's get the look here. So it's actually the look is
[9707.51s -> 9714.90s]  It's just like this but just we need that exact texture this exact texture
[9718.26s -> 9721.62s]  Because I just want to regular just cream it just cream. Okay. Oh my god
[9721.70s -> 9730.55s]  It's kind of perfect but not quite I like that middle but I need it to be a little smoother
[9733.74s -> 9739.61s]  close
[9739.61s -> 9740.81s]  Very close
[9740.81s -> 9747.21s]  Let me just get the look first
[9747.37s -> 9754.65s]  I'm gonna go back and do this later. Just give me give me a sec
[9756.42s -> 9759.74s]  Okay
[9759.74s -> 9761.42s]  Ice cream sandwich
[9761.42s -> 9766.18s]  I need the money black up top just a straight straight up just black
[9766.82s -> 9771.18s]  What should I do? Let's just I want to see what it looks like. Let's just you know, you idiot
[9772.18s -> 9777.46s]  Idiot, go
[9777.46s -> 9781.02s]  Okay, nice and smooth
[9781.02s -> 9782.66s]  Nice. All right
[9782.66s -> 9784.66s]  Get that black too. Good. Okay
[9786.25s -> 9788.33s]  It needs texture though. It needs texture
[9792.79s -> 9795.35s]  um
[9795.35s -> 9799.48s]  Reverse it that's the way
[9799.48s -> 9801.48s]  I call that perfect if you ask me
[9802.79s -> 9806.31s]  You want to go look at what an ice cream sandwich looks like right now go look at the top
[9807.83s -> 9822.10s]  You tell me if that's not exactly what it looks like looking good. Very good. Oh, that's incredible. Okay
[9823.06s -> 9826.26s]  All right. I need something else to add to this to make it
[9826.82s -> 9828.82s]  Really? You gotta do cookies and cream wheels
[9842.50s -> 9843.94s]  That's gotta be
[9843.94s -> 9847.74s]  Let me just get a base here
[9847.74s -> 9854.49s]  Oreos are a lot darker
[9854.49s -> 9860.44s]  Add stats. What are you talking about? You need to add capitalist parts to make it actually functional. What?
[9861.08s -> 9868.23s]  a couple of gumdrops
[9868.23s -> 9870.23s]  Do you put gumdrops on a ice cream sandwich?
[9870.87s -> 9881.90s]  But I understand why you would want them on this
[9885.13s -> 9887.24s]  It needs parts
[9887.24s -> 9890.18s]  Um, I have a hold on
[9890.26s -> 9892.26s]  Okay, I got the baseline here. Hold on
[9892.50s -> 9896.28s]  So how we have wheels we have a cockpit see there. It's fine
[9896.84s -> 9900.87s]  All right. Oh, this needs health and shit
[9901.78s -> 9902.90s]  oh
[9902.90s -> 9905.13s]  that's
[9905.13s -> 9909.11s]  economic
[9909.11s -> 9913.16s]  coins
[9913.16s -> 9915.78s]  effect detail. Oh
[9915.94s -> 9917.94s]  I thought I actually have to do stuff
[9918.34s -> 9928.26s]  cockpit, but no whatever
[9928.50s -> 9931.02s]  These could be little gumdrops
[9931.02s -> 9939.66s]  Do chocolate coins?
[9939.66s -> 9942.06s]  Oh, I kind of like the chocolate coin idea
[9953.83s -> 9955.43s]  And they're big too
[9955.43s -> 9973.94s]  Chocolate coins. I want the big one to be visible. There we go. Okay, we got our chocolate coins
[9975.88s -> 9983.61s]  These need to be different. These have to change. This has to be like bright yellow, right? Bright gold. Oh, you can't
[9984.01s -> 9992.42s]  Oh, that's all right
[9992.42s -> 10001.50s]  Because we just we can pretend
[10002.46s -> 10004.71s]  Charmed quark
[10004.71s -> 10006.71s]  Eye roller economic power
[10007.19s -> 10012.76s]  This could be one big chocolate coin
[10014.39s -> 10017.46s]  You need to look at the stats
[10017.46s -> 10020.74s]  economic land wheel and deal your way to the top by land
[10021.70s -> 10022.66s]  health
[10022.66s -> 10024.66s]  economic power or speed
[10025.75s -> 10033.42s]  Economic power increases trade route profitability survive longer in combat and speed
[10034.14s -> 10036.87s]  This thing's fast
[10036.87s -> 10038.87s]  All right. This is economic. Um
[10039.11s -> 10048.58s]  sandwich car
[10048.58s -> 10050.66s]  All right. I need to the wheels need detail
[10052.76s -> 10054.76s]  the capitalist oreo
[10057.38s -> 10062.14s]  Other way the wheels need a little bit more detail in the middle just like the cookies and cream pattern
[10074.62s -> 10076.10s]  um
[10076.10s -> 10077.22s]  too much
[10077.22s -> 10084.18s]  Other way. Yeah other way
[10089.88s -> 10097.46s]  Um, not dark enough. Oh me actually
[10099.58s -> 10105.93s]  Make a ring pop
[10105.93s -> 10107.93s]  No, no, it's wrong. It's gotta be
[10111.64s -> 10114.58s]  Okay, hold on. Everyone. Just hold on a second
[10115.22s -> 10140.78s]  I think i've got a little bit of an idea here. I don't hate this or it's oreo cereal
[10145.64s -> 10148.33s]  It is good job
[10149.43s -> 10160.17s]  Good don't work. You've got it. It's oreo. Oh, that's right. It needs to be a little darker though
[10168.06s -> 10174.30s]  No lighter. Yeah, that's true oreo is right there
[10183.48s -> 10197.13s]  Need to meet a gear on the bottom ring pop. I'll make a ring pop like airplanes. Hold on
[10197.69s -> 10201.32s]  Add m&m's on it. Hmm
[10202.68s -> 10210.55s]  That looks so cool. I love it
[10210.55s -> 10215.16s]  Holy shit, it's it's it is a ring pop, but this doesn't work on the chocolate though
[10215.56s -> 10225.26s]  It doesn't work on the chocolate weapons dumbass. This is that's not this is a this is not a weapon car
[10225.82s -> 10228.38s]  This is an economic land vehicle
[10236.04s -> 10237.88s]  hmm
[10237.88s -> 10242.63s]  Needs headlights
[10242.63s -> 10255.99s]  Does it you have to have weapons or you'll not win about where the weapons I don't see any weapons effect
[10256.39s -> 10268.20s]  Where do you see weapons? This is it's an economic nation
[10269.16s -> 10274.44s]  I don't have any weapons. All right. I like this the way it is
[10275.08s -> 10284.47s]  I like the oreo owes wheels ice cream sandwich and then the chocolate coins for the economics car make gumdrop headlights
[10284.95s -> 10314.70s]  Oh, but that's a great idea. I think I have to do that x yeah, there's nothing here night light
[10319.80s -> 10342.65s]  Gumdrop. Hmm. What should they be right here gumdrops or no
[10343.37s -> 10365.53s]  Milk duds. I gotta stick with the theme gotta stay with the theme guys. Can't just
[10371.03s -> 10381.67s]  Hmm, but they're lights. It's gonna be hard to do chocolate lights
[10383.03s -> 10397.96s]  Brown light you're gonna want more economic put the economic stuff underneath. Um, am I really though?
[10403.27s -> 10411.58s]  There we go rock candy lights just clip it into the car
[10412.06s -> 10439.43s]  Hmm. Those are what just like stuff this in here somewhere just clip this into the car. Um
[10440.55s -> 10450.30s]  Is there a reason why I can't I can't mess with this. It doesn't want me to I can't clip it in
[10454.23s -> 10486.36s]  What it has rims now, but that messes with what the oreo owes underneath now
[10486.36s -> 10504.39s]  That's kind of hidden between the headlights. No, I don't I want to be hidden. I don't even like the headlights
[10504.71s -> 10517.85s]  I don't like them. I don't want them. I wanted to be simple hide the coins. I like the chocolate coins
[10518.33s -> 10522.38s]  Physical ring pop brake light, please
[10535.83s -> 10540.47s]  Hold on
[10540.47s -> 10546.34s]  But it doesn't go with the chocolate theme. There's a theme. There's a theme
[10557.26s -> 10573.78s]  What about the theme? Why can I not pick these up? It's annoying. I can't clip it into there
[10573.94s -> 10597.06s]  The theme we want brake lights there ring pop brake lights sing the raid song
[10597.30s -> 10606.82s]  What fuck the lights keep the theme? I think it matches a little it does match
[10607.06s -> 10613.46s]  We don't know who raided what you talking about put the headlights back now. All right fine
[10613.54s -> 10622.38s]  I'll get the headlights back because we're going away from the theme which one it was it was these ones, right?

[10655.96s -> 10673.13s]  I test it. Can I drive it ice cream sandwich oreo owes vehicle its health is bad. Oh gosh
[10675.56s -> 10680.71s]  60 economic power it does that 230. How do I get more health?
[10695.08s -> 10698.39s]  swamp heater
[10698.39s -> 10712.47s]  Holy shit
[10712.47s -> 10714.55s]  No, it messes with the theme
[10714.55s -> 10735.40s]  But the theme I don't want it. This thing's just gonna get the shit kicked out of it. Um, it's because your cockpit sucks
[10736.36s -> 10745.11s]  What if I just put another no hide stuff under it? It's all percentages. Oh, okay
[10745.19s -> 10758.22s]  So it's a 60 economic powerhouse. All right, i'm that's good. That's good. I'm done there economic oreo

[10774.84s -> 10793.06s]  the red white and blue
[10793.30s -> 10804.63s]  Um, we did it the age of technology and transportation has arrived your city is the first to appear on the planet
[10805.37s -> 10811.61s]  But your species no longer speaks with a single voice soon. Other cities will arise built by factions of your own species
[10812.26s -> 10820.73s]  You must unify to advance welcome to civilization. You now control the vehicles and the city planning for your nation
[10821.29s -> 10823.03s]  Starting with its first city
[10823.03s -> 10828.60s]  You must interact with other nations when they appear to begin your quest for global domination. Let's take a look at the bar
[10830.63s -> 10836.71s]  Each city you conquer convert or purchase will help you progress towards the goal to control the entire planet
[10837.94s -> 10838.98s]  Okay
[10838.98s -> 10842.82s]  Your nation begins with a single specialty, but you can add more by conquering other cities
[10843.38s -> 10848.33s]  My specialty is I don't know move the camera freely around the world
[10848.33s -> 10851.93s]  This helps you to check in on cities or vehicles to whom you have given orders
[10852.17s -> 10856.10s]  All right, let's pause for a moment and learn the basic camera controls and how to select a vehicle

[10889.40s -> 10896.71s]  Spices become a valued commodity mining. It will help you fill the coffers of your nations. Okay, so you have to go to spice geysers
[10902.04s -> 10906.92s]  Okay, your nation's goals will appear here your first goal is to claim a spice geyser and begin mining operations
[10907.99s -> 10910.47s]  Controlling spice geysers will increase your nation's production
[10912.07s -> 10921.50s]  All right. Well, let's save it
[10921.50s -> 10922.38s]  Okay

[15770.46s -> 15787.74s]  This is a confusing mess. You said you stopped at the tribes. You lost a city. It's like going too fast
[15787.86s -> 15793.22s]  It's like just it's yeah, I don't even know it's how I there's two different reds
[15793.82s -> 15809.82s]  That already fucked me up. There's two reds. They're your crimson. What I cannot see the difference in these colors. There's no difference
[15809.82s -> 15817.92s]  That's the same image is literally that's literally the exact same color on the map. There's no difference at all
[15817.92s -> 15828.31s]  I don't own that even has been captured
[15832.10s -> 15841.76s]  Where's Haven is this Haven?
[15842.20s -> 15852.07s]  This is just like we all just took out the game of risk and like snorted lines of coke and start screaming at each other

[15919.76s -> 15921.76s]  It went very quickly
[15922.00s -> 15941.70s]  Maybe I should contact blue. I'm gonna contact blue. See what they're up to. Wait, what? I can't contact blue anymore
[15942.08s -> 15944.44s]  Let me contact yellow

[16105.70s -> 16114.84s]  Whose is this? You know what? I think the problem is here
[16115.36s -> 16119.50s]  This is from too many friends over your house. That's what the problem is with this
[16119.50s -> 16121.06s]  And this is the problem I had since the very beginning
[16121.06s -> 16126.52s]  They were one two three four five that what six seven people on the map on a map this small
[16126.86s -> 16128.86s]  Too many fucking people over your house to play risk
[16128.98s -> 16135.78s]  You can't play risk with six or seven people like that's too many people you play it with like three or four people four people
[16136.42s -> 16159.82s]  Not six. That's too many friends over your house. It's too spread out to be fair
[16159.82s -> 16169.05s]  The game is very hard while playing when you go in blind. I mean I I don't care
[16169.83s -> 16174.65s]  Do something I'm so overwhelmed. I don't even know where to start. It's like too many things have happened
[16174.65s -> 16178.04s]  I try to make like okay
[16178.04s -> 16183.96s]  I tried to make a trade route with two different cities and then like the world collapsed. What the fuck?
[16184.28s -> 16188.95s]  It was like I'd like to have a trade route
[16189.43s -> 16204.18s]  Yeah, everyone's dead your world is exploding make more factories. I don't even know what the factories do. Oh

[16247.21s -> 16249.21s]  At war
[16249.69s -> 16252.53s]  My god, holy shit, can I take this?
[16253.13s -> 16264.32s]  This is ready to take this is what you fucking deserve you deserve you deserve this shit

[16416.46s -> 16427.16s]  All right. Now I'm gonna buy all the cities with all the fake money that I have

[16463.74s -> 16476.20s]  I don't like this part this part stinks to me. I'm gonna buy orange and then
[16485.98s -> 16487.98s]  explain in detail of why I
[16489.07s -> 16493.57s]  Willing to bet that if there's 12,000 people here right now, it's just under 12,000
[16493.71s -> 16496.11s]  Those who that played this game before you probably don't remember
[16497.11s -> 16501.70s]  You getting to this part in the game and going I don't I'm just want to skip this
[16502.18s -> 16506.23s]  And then just giving yourself $50,000 is going to the space stage
[16506.87s -> 16512.22s]  Yeah, I think a lot of you just don't remember. They don't want to trade with me
[16512.68s -> 16532.70s]  We admire you and we want to give you free money. You like me yet your people our people admire you

[16586.50s -> 16591.07s]  What is going on over here?
[16591.07s -> 16599.31s]  Middle is hard. This middle road is the hardest for this stage. Wait, did I get bad RNG and got in the worst spot?
[16599.35s -> 16614.26s]  That's an excuse
[16614.70s -> 16617.52s]  Here's me. Would you like to trade?
[16618.58s -> 16619.70s]  great

[16645.21s -> 16649.82s]  Yeah, when you were like 15, you probably came home from school every day. You probably played this a thousand times
[16649.82s -> 16652.58s]  This is the first time I've ever seen this. I went to the creature stage
[16652.58s -> 16656.12s]  I've made the guys like elongated his tail and made a big head and then I never played the game ever again
[16656.74s -> 16686.17s]  Cheat more. Oh god. Damn it. The orange took this but what is this? What's this?

[16800.86s -> 16816.95s]  Mental gymnastics Andy the choices are your evolutionary history of go. It's just a straight line. I didn't do anything
[16817.19s -> 16825.22s]  That's an endgame thing your traits affect not only your inherent abilities
[16825.22s -> 16834.51s]  Okay, I beat this in multiple times as a baby without you weren't a baby. You were like at least 12
[16836.61s -> 16839.77s]  Creators are in it for the profit. Their only allegiance is to the almighty spore buck
[16842.64s -> 16850.14s]  Instantly makes trading systems available for pretty cool. All right, I legit beat this when I was 14

[16853.50s -> 16856.16s]  You probably played this you probably played this every day
[16856.76s -> 16862.38s]  look if me and a 14 year old were in a knitting contest and
[16862.66s -> 16868.30s]  That 14 year old knitted every day and it was super into knitting and they did it every day after school
[16868.30s -> 16872.18s]  They could get any they were really really into it. They're gonna beat me in a knitting contest

[16911.26s -> 16914.82s]  That doesn't matter all games are different
[16915.98s -> 16919.06s]  Every game is different from another what that are you really?
[16919.54s -> 16929.86s]  This game is wildly different than the last game that we played on this channel

[16935.54s -> 16948.34s]  Europe I'm a professional
[16948.98s -> 16961.94s]  Bore-streamer, this is the exact same game resume. You should be banned from every game. This is a kid's game
[16961.94s -> 16966.46s]  It doesn't matter out of a kid's game or not. It's the this isn't even a kid's game
[16967.10s -> 16971.06s]  Will Wheaton when he made this when he like got on stage

[17039.52s -> 17045.37s]  McDonald's is better than Wendy's more than half the time. I like eating there more than I like eating at Wendy's. I
[17060.51s -> 17062.51s]  Can't believe you cheated
[17064.90s -> 17079.67s]  You guys have fun I like having fun with you guys whoo, I like that bully button

[17215.36s -> 17221.11s]  It's worth hacking in space because it's really really hard to get money
[17221.63s -> 17228.02s]  Well, I mean, I'm probably only gonna just drive around and just look at stuff
[17228.34s -> 17239.63s]  The space days sucks to be honest. This part sucks. This part is bad. I'm gonna be really mad at this

[17635.67s -> 17638.39s]  I just burped really loud under my breath and leaned back
[17638.39s -> 17644.48s]  So the limiter didn't pick it up is an incoming transmission if it's blinking. Okay, so it's blinking
[17646.58s -> 17649.42s]  Congratulations cadet. You've got a fine ride there
[17649.70s -> 17653.70s]  We're still adding new equipment to your ship, but we should have it ready for space travel in no time
[17654.10s -> 17661.35s]  Have you flown a spaceship before no, well, nothing like a test flight while the entire population of the germa might of planet
[17661.35s -> 17665.11s]  Zircon looks on what do you say ready to earn your captain's badge?
[17665.67s -> 17670.44s]  Yeah, each city on planet Zircon
[17670.96s -> 17675.36s]  Has launched a giant orb in celebration of our first spaceship really you can't miss them
[17675.72s -> 17680.92s]  Take your ship on a spin around the planet to seven of our cities fly through the orbs to break them
[17681.12s -> 17686.00s]  Okay, your immediate mission goals are tracked here in the mini mission log
[17686.40s -> 17692.10s]  You can track up to three missions in mini form from the full mission log by hitting the L key
[17692.10s -> 17695.86s]  Okay, I through the orbs the right mouse button use the arrow keys to fly
[17696.38s -> 17728.31s]  See if you can crash fly through the orbs or more
[17735.11s -> 17744.31s]  64 it kind of is fresh joke
[17745.15s -> 17748.22s]  Come on
[17749.14s -> 17755.61s]  Job cadet worth flying like that. You'll make captain in no time now that you're an ace at flying
[17755.61s -> 17761.91s]  We're ready for you to use some of the sophisticated tools. Just whatever it will happen. It won't happen
[17762.19s -> 17765.99s]  We've been working on the ability to scan the planets and animals you discover on your travels
[17766.15s -> 17768.52s]  Looks like this tool comes just in the nick of time
[17768.96s -> 17774.84s]  The sporepedia record of one of our own animals recently became corrupted at the same time the animals started exhibiting some odd symptoms
[17774.92s -> 17780.29s]  We need you to scan the animal so we can collect more information about the species
[17780.69s -> 17786.75s]  The creature in question is exhibiting a glowing tail an odd glowing trail
[17786.99s -> 17789.79s]  Just wipe that part out and rewrite over it
[17789.91s -> 17794.03s]  Your ship has been equipped with a radar tool that can be turned off and on in the main tools panel
[17794.07s -> 17798.31s]  It will point to emission targets and items of interest when on a planet surface
[17798.51s -> 17803.36s]  The radar beeps faster when you're closer to your target. I'm laughing
[17803.36s -> 17814.80s]  I keep glancing at what you guys are writing. It's like the scan tool. Oh my god
[17814.80s -> 17818.66s]  There's a lot of tools your tools panel is sorted by type
[17818.82s -> 17823.28s]  Your scan tools found in the main tools panel look up your scan tool by clicking on it or just press 2
[17823.44s -> 17840.00s]  Okay, scan to enter the information targeted so we have to find somebody remember when I was down there and I was one of these
[17840.48s -> 17853.52s]  Get them pick them up
[17853.68s -> 17868.68s]  Let's get doing
[17868.68s -> 17870.68s]  Execute him. What am I supposed to do?
[17871.28s -> 17877.68s]  Scan him. I'm
[17877.72s -> 17900.68s]  Trying to left click on him. Oh, well, it's always right click. What do you want to do next? Okay, quite valuable
[17900.84s -> 17905.48s]  It is now third or so. We need to examine the species more closely ship is equipped with an abduction beam
[17906.08s -> 17908.14s]  abduct a species
[17908.14s -> 17913.11s]  Use the abduction beam found in the cargo panel to collect this creature for further research
[17913.67s -> 17917.35s]  Make sure you deploy the tool long enough until the creature is fully secured in the ship's cargo bay
[17917.79s -> 17923.77s]  Stopping too soon before your cargo is secured may result in less than desirable circumstances for the victim. Oh, I mean the specimen
[17924.15s -> 17954.96s]  Okay, we're getting drunk. Let's go get him. Okay this one here. All right, let's get him
[17955.36s -> 17959.24s]  Your active tool is shown in your spaceport your ship portrait
[17960.58s -> 17980.12s]  deactivated tool press escape I kill him what I clicked on him I
[17982.40s -> 17984.40s]  abducted a diseased animal
[17995.00s -> 17997.00s]  abduct a ball-luing animal
[17997.48s -> 18006.48s]  Drop off the ball-luing within the city walls
[18023.36s -> 18028.24s]  Measurably fine work cadet. You've provided us with excellent specimen to research probe twice abduct once
[18028.24s -> 18036.72s]  I always say now what it appears the specimen you collected was sick and is infested with a virus that is capable of spreading at
[18036.72s -> 18047.12s]  An alarming rate it could endanger our entire ecosystem. Okay, take out the infected creatures while while avoiding the healthy ones
[18047.78s -> 18051.11s]  Look at how many tabs there are down there
[18051.31s -> 18058.24s]  Be careful you point that laser. It's capable of destroying buildings vehicles and other spaceships. Oh dear
[18058.80s -> 18071.40s]  Okay, I have the laser equipped and be careful only kill the ones that are here
[18072.04s -> 18079.59s]  Damn, okay
[18079.59s -> 18092.55s]  More over here
[18092.55s -> 18097.27s]  Don't fire at me. What are you doing? I'm in the air over here
[18097.95s -> 18102.70s]  Well
[18102.70s -> 18104.74s]  You
[18104.74s -> 18132.88s]  You want to kill this guy? I mean that wanted me to kill him remove one more diseased animal
[18132.88s -> 18150.49s]  Why is it making me go this way?
[18150.49s -> 18170.56s]  Where they're diseased? Yeah, I know but where's this last one over here kill everyone from the city?
[18171.67s -> 18177.10s]  Psycho, that's kind of weird. It was pointing at that other guy
[18177.74s -> 18188.16s]  Okay, that's that I need to go BRB one more time because Otto wants to go outside. He just went hey
[18188.16s -> 18608.42s]  He doesn't yell to me. I'll be right back final BRB of the night. I would assume you're back. I have returned
[18610.91s -> 18622.57s]  I got some chocolate while Otto took a poop. I'm just sitting there watching him
[18623.09s -> 18632.88s]  Out there just eating chocolate while he's shitting and I don't know it was I didn't mean for that to happen, but it did
[18642.23s -> 18646.04s]  Somebody just writes thanks for sharing
[18648.26s -> 18659.48s]  Yeah, that story did not need to be told like I didn't need to tell you that
[18660.00s -> 18671.76s]  No, none of you needed to know that happened. I don't know why I decided to tell you there was no relevance to do to explain that
[18672.20s -> 18683.36s]  Anyways, let's continue. What we're doing. We were examining creatures
[18685.63s -> 18687.63s]  Laudable job. You're on the right stuff
[18687.79s -> 18690.07s]  You've earned your homeworld's respect and confidence
[18690.35s -> 18695.07s]  We want you to pile this spaceship and lead our race forward into galactic explanation and glory. It's getting stuck
[18695.31s -> 18700.56s]  You've earned the badge and title of captain. It's coconut. That's why I thought it was weird
[18700.56s -> 18704.69s]  I always feel like I'm eating fucking like shaved wood
[18705.57s -> 18710.45s]  Chips our scientists have developed an interplanetary drive for your ship, but you'll need to install it first
[18710.93s -> 18716.31s]  Use the trade panel to buy and sell tools
[18717.27s -> 18719.15s]  spice and rares
[18719.15s -> 18722.39s]  Items from your cargo that can be sold will appear at the bottom of the trade panel. Okay
[18722.39s -> 18730.97s]  I can't it's still there click on the items in the trade panel. You wish to buy and sell I'll take this
[18731.49s -> 18736.84s]  Alright, let's do it
[18736.84s -> 18738.52s]  Let's go see space
[18738.52s -> 18745.73s]  Stop bragging about eating a coconut eating chocolate coconut. What's that?
[18749.02s -> 18755.86s]  Okay, get your spandex suit we suspect you're not alone in the galaxy. We picked up strange radio signals. Let's do it
[18756.38s -> 18765.52s]  It's time for interplanetary space travel. You've earned the badge and title of captain
[18765.54s -> 18775.46s]  Okay, your collection your Michael gives you access to your mission log badge clicking tools and rears. Hmm. Oh my god
[18775.58s -> 18792.05s]  This is like a the world of Warcraft achievement book. He's this loser unlocked by earning badges
[18792.25s -> 18800.36s]  This is cool. Some tools are consumable and require restocking others who's a permanent. Okay, cool
[18800.52s -> 18810.64s]  We're not gonna see any of this by the way. All right, cool. Let's go use the mouse wheel to exit the solar system. Whoa
[18811.32s -> 18821.64s]  Whoa, why do planet Dorges? I read I've
[18824.04s -> 18845.65s]  Dorges, okay, let me go in and it Dorges cool. Something is showing up on the ship's radar alien
[18845.65s -> 18862.73s]  It's a crash spacecraft that is emitting a strange radio signal. Why don't you use the scan tool to investigate the crash site? Okay
[18864.14s -> 18880.90s]  Okay, this is a cool planet. I wish I played here. All right scan it. What happened?
[18886.77s -> 18889.21s]  You wish you could retroactively go back and make a game score higher
[18889.21s -> 18897.28s]  You know how much I've fought with the fact that Outer Wilds was an 89 aliens
[18897.28s -> 18900.82s]  But no signs of life looks like they drew some type of cryptic map before they died
[18901.04s -> 18913.17s]  Wait, the wreck has triggered a transfer beam. Some items are coming aboard played out of wilds for like two hours
[18913.17s -> 18923.89s]  What I beat the whole game missiles and interstellar drive
[18924.05s -> 18929.09s]  Which seems to have an unknown stars coordinates programmed into it the wrecks damage looks like it came from a fight
[18929.09s -> 18935.16s]  The ship must have been sent from some of the planet to get help. No game is perfect outer wilds close
[18935.48s -> 18943.24s]  Well, I said 89 but I think that's cuz I was just very mad at flying into the Sun like the thousand times
[18947.06s -> 18969.16s]  It's probably 91. Okay, leave the solar system in a galactic view
[18969.16s -> 18980.31s]  What the hell it's responding to a beacon from a nearby star that matches the coordinates in his memory
[18980.31s -> 19001.20s]  This must be for the home planet. Why do planet Voral a hell avilus planet Voral we go in here
[19001.28s -> 19023.60s]  What the fuck? This is what this end game is like. It's a world to keep going into in here
[19023.60s -> 19035.84s]  Oh my god on top of it. The end game is running errands between space colonies
[19038.80s -> 19045.24s]  Nothing's glowing on the radar. It's a lot of fun, but it's really long
[19045.36s -> 19066.40s]  Well, at least I got to see it scanning the ruins may help reveal what happened get it
[19067.52s -> 19072.92s]  End of the spore voice. It's coming. It's coming pretty soon
[19073.52s -> 19077.17s]  Not immediately, but it's gonna happen soon
[19079.96s -> 19090.86s]  Activities on the radar. Oh shit other spacecraft the scam was to trigger the colony's defenses
[19090.86s -> 19093.06s]  These drones don't look friendly wait an incoming transmission
[19094.66s -> 19096.66s]  warning grok's intruders to
[19096.74s -> 19103.52s]  gronk's intruders all grok's intruders will be terminated initializing self-defense called gronk's
[19104.40s -> 19114.68s]  999 all grok's intruders will be terminated. We're not grok's all grok's will be intruders. Let's get out of here
[19115.16s -> 19131.18s]  Okay returned to your home world back to home world
[19131.74s -> 19142.04s]  Execute grok's number six sixty six or wild is like a seven. No, I disagree with that
[19142.72s -> 19151.98s]  Radio signals emanating from the star fly in and explore it. Isn't this where I live?
[19152.56s -> 19157.03s]  Oh, I got red spices
[19157.23s -> 19181.27s]  It's going bink bink. I was doing that mission accomplished
[19181.51s -> 19185.75s]  We knew we weren't alone in the galaxy trace of an extinct civilization hostile security drones in the grok's
[19185.95s -> 19191.81s]  It's obvious that we must continue our exploration of the galaxy and potentially prepare for hostilities
[19191.89s -> 19196.00s]  In order to do so we'll need to set up colonies as basis of operation
[19196.87s -> 19200.59s]  Scientists are already reverse engineering the interstellar drive to replicate its technology
[19200.59s -> 19204.09s]  We've also developed a city device for your ship
[19204.09s -> 19209.68s]  We'll pick up signals of other sentient life in the galaxy indicated by radio signals over stars that you target
[19209.68s -> 19218.76s]  We need you at the helm of our space program. Mm-hmm expand the empire and get more wealth
[19218.84s -> 19227.32s]  There's some volunteers to be part of the crew. Okay. Well, I'm
[19227.92s -> 19243.52s]  Leave me alone calling me. Okay. How do I establish a colony? Excellent placing a colony is easy
[19244.08s -> 19246.08s]  After flying to planet Neem on
[19246.12s -> 19251.38s]  Select the colony tool that has been added to your colonization tool bin and place the colony on land near a spice geyser
[19251.66s -> 19255.17s]  It'll instantly unpack creating a colony. No assembly required
[19255.21s -> 19259.36s]  I want to make contact with a colony to make sure the citizens packed in there
[19260.10s -> 19262.72s]  unpacked safely, okay
[19263.32s -> 19280.52s]  Bye, we're good to go to planet Neem on he hook you who control the spice controls the universe. All right, where's
[19281.04s -> 19297.20s]  Thuja to system star map filters my empire. Oh, okay. Okay missions, right?
[19298.40s -> 19310.07s]  Thuja to zoom out all the way baby. All right, holy shit. Well, I'm not seeing any of that
[19310.07s -> 19320.05s]  I gotta go to Neem on
[19320.09s -> 19332.24s]  Planets in green orbit paths are easier to terraform and colonize than planets on red or blue orbit paths
[19332.24s -> 19337.96s]  I have question question for you. So spore the game
[19338.24s -> 19346.55s]  They made a space simulation game and then added like a funny character creator onto the bottom of it
[19346.55s -> 19355.84s]  That what I did how this worked this feels like way more detailed than the rest of the entire game
[19355.92s -> 19372.93s]  Okay, there's Neem on base mode is a slog
[19373.17s -> 19377.21s]  This is 90% of the rest of the game 90% of the game from here on is the game
[19377.53s -> 19385.14s]  Does that mean that we did 10% of the game? Wow
[19388.16s -> 19393.95s]  Colonies can be established on any planet from barren moons to lush terrors go or three oasis
[19397.29s -> 19404.69s]  Fruitful colonies mine spice that can be traded. I said we plant a colony near the spice geysers
[19405.09s -> 19425.80s]  Let's get shot. There we go. I
[19429.62s -> 19441.46s]  Used to want place for so badly, but I only had the weird DS game. That's right. They did make a weird DS game
[19441.46s -> 19448.08s]  Didn't they I forgot about that completely what hold on?
[19448.32s -> 19460.88s]  I want to look this up. You just brought back a memory that I've buried for so long
[19461.70s -> 19479.45s]  Spore creatures. Yeah, I do remember this it was weird too. You have your own Empire cool. Oh, this is cool
[19479.45s -> 19481.45s]  We're in the endgame now Peter. So I mean, this is like cool
[19481.97s -> 19499.86s]  Report back to the home world report back to your home world for glory. All right, I love doing running around doing spice trades
[19499.86s -> 19507.20s]  Yeah, this is cool. What if I go get some I'm gonna go here. Why not? Let's go to Tantarok
[19511.42s -> 19529.54s]  Spore hero arena, this is cool. Cool. All right dark spore. Yeah, that was a
[19531.54s -> 19545.94s]  Arpg right that one was cool. This was no man's sky a decade before no man's sky. That's true
[19546.24s -> 19562.56s]  There's a no man's sky fun. You collected spice. It's a valued commodity. It cool depends. It's better now
[19562.56s -> 19564.44s]  Yeah, it's supposed to be fun now
[19564.44s -> 19571.39s]  Be counting on you to visit this colony frequently to collect spice from it. Oh shit. You have to actually physically go there
[19571.79s -> 19578.04s]  Catherine we've intercepted transmissions that we believe are coming from other advanced beings in the galaxy
[19578.04s -> 19583.32s]  We need to investigate attempt to establish first contact use the Shetty tool equipped on your ship to help find them
[19583.72s -> 19591.40s]  Okay, let's go. We've been able to pinpoint the exact location of these transmissions
[19591.84s -> 19603.91s]  You need to explore a bit. All right, let's go get the hell out of here
[19604.11s -> 19608.15s]  Find an alien Empire find another spacefaring Empire and communicate with them
[19608.15s -> 19612.23s]  You will know they are spacefaring once you get close enough to their harm star system
[19612.51s -> 19620.56s]  Establish contact with them using the short-range video communicator. All right. All right, let's go. Let's find them
[19620.68s -> 19662.15s]  Where are they they on future too? Oh shit. That's your colony, right? Right? Oh, hold on over here
[19662.67s -> 19685.14s]  Look, I'm trying to hear the radio. No radio radio means nothing. It's a visual. Okay
[19693.54s -> 19707.37s]  Nobody over here over to I hear something somebody over there. I'm right here somebody's here
[19707.45s -> 19719.37s]  Big's equation was right a living alien race
[19719.37s -> 19728.56s]  We're not alone looks like they have sent an envoy to greet you talk to them. Welcome. Welcome
[19728.56s -> 19732.60s]  Always a pleasure pleasure to meet another friend provided. You are a friend, of course
[19733.16s -> 19739.05s]  Give us your name. I am from the gerbomite. I come in peace
[19739.53s -> 19745.19s]  Behold I am from the great and mighty planet Zircan call off your fighter before I blasted into pieces behold
[19745.19s -> 19748.84s]  I am from the great and mighty planet of Zircan
[19749.36s -> 19756.15s]  We agree that you are absolutely tremendous. Will you spend money now?
[19756.55s -> 19760.84s]  I'm not as small as you think but let's continue
[19761.56s -> 19769.29s]  Yes. Yes, happy to help happy to help. What can we do for you? I get my ship repaired, please and my ship recharged
[19769.29s -> 19771.60s]  Please and let's trade. Oh
[19772.48s -> 19776.77s]  Okay, I've got some red spices. What do you think about that?
[19777.57s -> 19791.33s]  You have way too happy with that. That's like you have four aces in your hand at the poker table
[19791.33s -> 19797.12s]  Um, is it my getting I can scammed
[19803.13s -> 19807.58s]  Diplomacy I'd like to know about your race. Please accept a gift so we can be friends
[19807.58s -> 19812.02s]  I like to establish a trade route. Tell me more about your race
[19812.54s -> 19820.10s]  Thanks to the philosophy of prosperity. We the Kurgle Empire love everything. We love our empire. We love other empires
[19820.50s -> 19823.54s]  We love happy people. We love unhappy people
[19824.02s -> 19828.82s]  Most of all, we love our profit margins and we love all the other things because they contribute to our margins

[19857.48s -> 19863.81s]  Okay, commanding a spacecraft is only half the responsibilities of a space captain
[19863.93s -> 19869.92s]  The other half requires planetside tactical skills where you and your crew will need to leave your spaceship and beam down to planets
[19871.71s -> 19880.19s]  Okay, you have to beam down like Star Trek. Let's go once you get to
[19880.79s -> 19889.29s]  Teebo nor rawr. You will need to beam down to the planet. Oh, that sounds like fun

[19947.62s -> 19957.80s]  I would not tell you how I would not have any idea the download from your data recorder is quite amazing captain
[19957.80s -> 19960.34s]  We had no idea other spacefaring civilizations were so close by

[20354.56s -> 20356.68s]  Spaceport Authority and it's your servant
[20357.16s -> 20359.44s]  Welcomes you captain if you look to become a great space captain

[20597.76s -> 20605.92s]  Imagine like imagine listening to that conversation. Oh, I'm not a video game streamer. I'm an e-clown
[20606.52s -> 20610.64s]  Okay, I don't stream video games. I mean I played them, but I'm a claw. I'm an e-clown
[20610.64s -> 20616.28s]  I don't care. I would have to be in full makeup on the phone
[20616.28s -> 20623.61s]  I think full clown makeup with a controller in my hand like a GameCube controller and a cigarette in my mouth
[20623.97s -> 20630.16s]  Trying to keep up with this with all the shitty that all these kids like these days
[20630.52s -> 20653.89s]  I'm just smushing my face in his ass
[20660.74s -> 20664.68s]  Goodbye, you know what? I'm done. I'll see you later. Let's see
[20670.55s -> 20689.33s]  Music they I say it's right before that Sunday stream, please Sunday stream, please. Sorry. You're gonna be very disappointed
[20689.33s -> 20692.98s]  there's no Sunday stream and
[20693.30s -> 20697.60s]  It's not even a Monday stream. There is a Tuesday stream
[20698.24s -> 20700.64s]  There is a Tuesday Wednesday Thursday stream Oh
[20702.43s -> 20712.34s]  Yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday, right? But today's Saturday, right Sunday, but yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday
[20712.90s -> 20717.77s]  I'm gonna try to get Pikmin 2 ready
[20718.33s -> 20725.28s]  That's the plan. I can't take this anymore. I gotta get out of this wrong thing
[20728.58s -> 20735.86s]  I'm gonna try to play Pikmin 2 on. Oh, that's really good. It's from that painting game such art
[20735.86s -> 20741.33s]  I'm gonna just retire if you hate us so much
[20744.68s -> 20751.54s]  What the hell oh look at that it's the bear back-to-back cool
[20751.82s -> 20757.85s]  We've seen a couple of those if for some if for some reason I do not play Pikmin on Tuesday
[20757.85s -> 20762.67s]  I'll play it on Wednesday or Thursday, but the plan is to try to get Pikmin ready
[20762.91s -> 20764.91s]  Try to have everything set up and play Pikmin 2
[20765.93s -> 20773.04s]  If it's not Pikmin 2 on Tuesday, then it'll be a mystery game and then we'll play and hopefully beat Pikmin 2
[20773.72s -> 20792.93s]  Next week play Nintendo land by yourself. Will you beat spore?
[20794.43s -> 20801.60s]  No, this is probably the last time you're gonna see spore. It was very fun
[20801.60s -> 20804.64s]  I heavily enjoyed my time except for about
[20805.20s -> 20807.20s]  except for the for the part of
[20807.24s -> 20811.08s]  It was like a 10-minute portion of the civilization phase
[20811.26s -> 20814.84s]  Had to skip it because I didn't like it and I wanted to get out of there
[20814.88s -> 20823.34s]  What would you give spore for a rating 89 now 87?
[20827.36s -> 20836.42s]  Too much of water. It's not an 87. It's on it realistically
[20836.82s -> 20840.54s]  The crew okay the creature part the creature creator is like a 95
[20840.74s -> 20857.75s]  the video game of spore is like a 4 if I have to be totally honest, but like the creature stuff is
[20858.43s -> 20863.13s]  No, I would say even like 98 when that first came out. That was such a big deal
[20863.19s -> 20865.91s]  but like the video game portion of it is
[20866.92s -> 20876.49s]  Mmm, like a 4.8 for like the video game portion. So you average those two together. No, no, no, that's not for it
[20876.49s -> 20887.32s]  Let's say 6 a 9.8 and a 6 together is an 8.7. It's important bits about thousand-year door. There is I mean
[20887.32s -> 20895.08s]  Let me look at let me okay. Here's some bits. Jerma film yourself eating an entire jar of olives now. That's not thousand-year door
[20895.08s -> 20902.33s]  Uh chat don't tell them just take your time and have fun Jerma. You don't need to rush
[20905.83s -> 20913.27s]  Where did your brain is bad Jerma? I think you want the game's journalist difficulty
[20913.27s -> 20928.27s]  I don't see anything about thousand-year door. That was like my favorite part of the whole night
[20928.35s -> 20940.14s]  If you want to play a thousand-year door, please play the way you want not the way others people say to do it
[20940.14s -> 20954.56s]  I've been told that I'm gonna get heavily backseated in thousand-year door. I'm ready for it whenever we play it
[20954.64s -> 20958.57s]  It's a bug for the original thousand-year door game
[20958.57s -> 20972.81s]  It's very important that before you start playing you take a stinky whatever there was the spore city level also filled with concrete
[20972.81s -> 20979.90s]  I don't know. I thought that was a photo of me for a second
[20980.42s -> 20987.06s]  Alright, I'll see you guys on on Tuesday. If it's not Pikmin 2 then it'll be something else
[20987.96s -> 20993.53s]  Expect Pikmin 2 within the next two or three streams. That was spore. It was a lot of fun
[20993.81s -> 21003.97s]  Thanks for watching as always everybody. Thanks for hanging out for as long as you have
[21004.39s -> 21011.29s]  Yeah, it is getting late Eastern time. So I know a lot of people are you know getting tired
[21011.29s -> 21026.56s]  So let me get to the the credits a little bit more art. Here's all the subs from today
[21027.08s -> 21035.85s]  Resubs gifted subs everything. Thanks a lot as always everybody. Let them roll
[21036.37s -> 21041.28s]  You inspired me to reinstall spore and play it again
[21041.28s -> 21046.82s]  It's I mean if I joke about a lot of the shit in there you guys know, it's just jokes, right?
[21046.98s -> 21056.33s]  It doesn't deserve a four about it. I mean it does but it doesn't right. It's a fucked up
[21056.33s -> 21071.08s]  I know I know how long I'm gonna try it. Can I grab it?
[21071.76s -> 21084.25s]  Hey, I fixed it. We said they would literally give me a copy of thousand-year door if you need it
[21084.25s -> 21088.56s]  I will not take it. I appreciate it though. I
[21089.84s -> 21103.75s]  Do not I will not I do not accept anything from anyone. Don't just let you know for the future about two copies
