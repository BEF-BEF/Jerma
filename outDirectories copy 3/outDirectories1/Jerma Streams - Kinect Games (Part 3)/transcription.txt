[3.00s -> 15.54s]  How are you doing? Good. Really, really good. I'm glad to hear it. This stream is going to be
[15.54s -> 30.17s]  bopping in the next minute or two. Tonight we're going to do Connect again, but we're going to be
[30.17s -> 43.50s]  focused. Laser focused. Horror games. We've got quite a selection. There are two. Blockjam,
[43.50s -> 53.46s]  blockjam! There are two of them, and one of them has really bad reviews, and the other one
[54.81s -> 61.64s]  has really good reviews. So we're going to do them both, because that's what we do here. We explore
[63.78s -> 76.28s]  the entire gaming atmosphere, and I've got an even better hair solution today. I'll show you
[76.28s -> 85.16s]  in just a second. Oh, and by the way, if you're good, I'm going to show you something remarkable
[85.72s -> 103.34s]  later. Only if you're good. Only if you're good. I got my coffee. I've got my large water.
[104.14s -> 114.20s]  I'm never going to be good. Well, you better be good. If that guy that said that is not good today,
[115.85s -> 126.09s]  it ain't happening. We're going to start with Rise of Nightmares. It's going to be a coin flip to
[126.09s -> 134.76s]  which one of these sucks, but I'm, I'm going to give it some time. I also lowered the, I lowered
[134.76s -> 142.23s]  the volume of the lights in the room too. I don't want it to be too loud in here. And yes, there are
[142.31s -> 151.11s]  some denominations. Sound is, it can be used as volume. That's a scientific term. It's DB.
[151.75s -> 170.23s]  Let's go. Why did it just spit it out? Get in there. So here comes Rise of Nightmares. We're
[170.23s -> 179.88s]  going to start off like this. You should see it right now. You should also see me. Uh oh,
[179.88s -> 191.03s]  they don't see me. Hold on. I gotta like fix this. It looks like I have a warped head. I promise I
[191.03s -> 197.94s]  don't have a warped head. I had to have some kind of solution. Oh, this is going to be up
[197.94s -> 204.98s]  a little higher. What the fuck is this doing? All right. No, no, no. The connect is moving.
[204.98s -> 220.60s]  The connect is moving on its own. Okay. Is that better? Extend your hand forward to start.
[221.24s -> 223.48s]  All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta make sure this is in the right spot.
[224.28s -> 232.34s]  That looks all right. Is it too loud? Well, it's a horror game. It's supposed to be fucking loud.
[233.72s -> 248.68s]  You don't turn the volume down on a horror game. You turn it up. Today we're going to play as Dave.
[253.62s -> 269.83s]  All right. Will you? I'm going to recalibrate this thing. It's been a week. Great new saying.
[269.83s -> 273.99s]  Yes, please do. Is that one like holding your hand this way?
[279.70s -> 283.62s]  Wait, position check. You are, you are now in the optimal play area. Extend your arm forward to
[283.62s -> 298.55s]  begin. This is matched up. Should be. Did you hear it? Brightness. Adjust the brightness of
[298.55s -> 307.77s]  the triangle edge is visible, but the inner crest is not. I need, I need to be able to see. You know
[307.77s -> 315.75s]  what I mean? I don't know how people play horror games like this. Why would you ever turn it down
[315.75s -> 325.08s]  like this? You can't see shit. You can't even play the game. All right. We're going to go right there
[325.72s -> 329.32s]  because I can, I can see the outline. That's better. Hold on.
[332.71s -> 337.62s]  And oh, it feels good every time. New game. All right. Play from the very beginning. I'm going
[337.62s -> 341.38s]  to get ready because this is going to, this is going to scare my socks off. Wait, this is good.
[341.38s -> 349.24s]  The camera's on a good spot. Wait, I feel like I'm going to like send a fucking like birthday
[349.24s -> 370.17s]  greeting to grandma. Wait, hold on. Okay. Hey, grandma happy? No, a little lower. No mercy humane
[370.17s -> 381.42s]  or, or every time streamer says something that has any base in science at all. Anytime streamer
[381.42s -> 390.20s]  says something that you disagree with. Anytime a streamer says something that you didn't know
[390.20s -> 408.06s]  before, but now you know now. No mercy. Is no mercy. Okay. This the game of difficulty can be
[408.06s -> 420.65s]  changed. Yeah, that's fine. Let's go real quick. This one's for moving. This one's for grooving.
[420.65s -> 430.28s]  You know what I'm saying? That's dope. Don't even need it. Oh, he's going to spill it and
[430.28s -> 449.29s]  it's going to be hilarious. Oh Christ, he barked. He said something. Turn your shoulders left and
[449.29s -> 457.54s]  right to rotate the camera. What was this shit? When you extend and hold your arm out towards the
[457.54s -> 465.62s]  screen, the target pointer will be displayed. Interact with any object that has an interaction
[465.62s -> 475.05s]  icon. I don't speak French. Thank God it's you. I didn't think anyone else survived.
[475.69s -> 487.45s]  She's going to get like grab. When you extend and hold your arm out towards the screen,
[487.45s -> 499.02s]  the target pointer will be displayed. There's a pipe. I didn't even pick that up. By holding
[499.02s -> 504.62s]  your arms like you're boxing, you will do a fighting stance. You can attack by swinging
[504.62s -> 520.50s]  the weapon you're holding. Okay. Hit the chain. Hit the chain. It's a cut scene.
[523.50s -> 530.47s]  Chains holding door shut can be broken with a weapon. First hit. All right, now go on.
[538.23s -> 540.23s]  Try opening this door just like you would in real life.
[543.75s -> 551.14s]  How do you move? How do you walk? How do you walk? To move forward, place a foot out in front of you.
[551.30s -> 552.90s]  Your speed changes based on how
[563.45s -> 565.61s]  Why am I walking like that?
[570.25s -> 593.58s]  What the fuck is that? Stop doing that. I'm like the Warner Brothers frog. This is fucking odd.
[593.58s -> 613.40s]  All right, hold on. Walk? What the fuck? I can't move around. What? When you see an auto movement
[613.40s -> 618.60s]  icon displayed, hold up your right arm to move automatically. Yeah. Let's go. Automatically,
[618.60s -> 635.54s]  please. Again, there ain't no way I'm going to be able to do this. Somebody in here? Oh,
[635.54s -> 654.34s]  there is somebody in here. Open the door. All right, here we go. No. Can you get me back on
[654.34s -> 659.54s]  track, please? Thank you. Can you do that again? Just get me back on track. I would appreciate it.
[660.50s -> 670.23s]  Okay, thank you. Oh, you just hold it. You don't have to actually walk. You just slide your foot out.
[670.95s -> 692.52s]  You can't open that door. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I go this way. Wait, wait, there's a thing. Pull
[692.52s -> 700.28s]  it down. When the icon is displayed, you will need to perform a situational gesture. It's a pole.
[703.32s -> 715.05s]  Uh-oh. I'm glad they closed the doors behind them. While in fighting stance,
[715.05s -> 739.24s]  you don't want to make them focus. All right, that feels all right. Now what? How do I get
[739.24s -> 765.59s]  over there? I pull the lever. Oh, there's another guy right here. Who's next? Can I run? Or do I
[765.59s -> 770.95s]  just have to walk like this? Turning? You won't be able to turn while focusing. Remember to drop
[770.95s -> 797.03s]  both arms when you want to turn. Oh. Like waiting for your children. Got it. Open the door. That's
[797.03s -> 800.95s]  bullshit. All right. Let me tell you something. If you like are like a building contractor or
[800.95s -> 807.43s]  you're like an architect, handle is pulled. Plate is push. I don't know. How the fuck do we not
[807.43s -> 820.25s]  understand this? It's been like 60 years of this. What am I supposed to do in here? And sometimes
[820.25s -> 826.57s]  some buildings have half of them are push for plate and half of them are like push. They go
[826.57s -> 840.65s]  half and half. It's fucked up. Why am I in here? Just do it for me. But that went both ways.
[841.77s -> 862.60s]  That door is on like an axle. Do it for me. Hey, it's me. I got you. Now what? Are you going to
[862.60s -> 877.74s]  follow me? What are you saying? You're an autopilot. Big bits can't rule. Shit. I can't do it.
[886.04s -> 910.47s]  Oh, it's one of those monsters. Where did you go? Where did you go? How do you run?
[910.47s -> 932.58s]  It's blood. I don't like this. I don't like blood. Oh shit. Okay, I can do it.
[953.40s -> 972.07s]  Well, we both died. Now I'm going to be a reporter coming to investigate the scene, right?
[973.03s -> 986.49s]  The ice has already melted. It's so hot here. All right, that was a cool game. What's next?
[987.29s -> 1005.11s]  This. For like the next seven to twelve hundred. I'm going to be a reporter. Come on. Notice how I
[1005.11s -> 1023.18s]  said seven to twelve hundred. That is seven with no digits after it. Oh shit, the walls. The train.
[1023.34s -> 1041.48s]  The world. Who's in your jacket? I take my eyes off of you for
[1043.51s -> 1053.54s]  why would you take it out of your pocket? I didn't mean you should start hiding it.
[1053.54s -> 1065.30s]  I hate sounding like a nagging wife, but I've been putting up with this for five years.
[1065.30s -> 1075.11s]  When do you grow up? Excuse you. But I can't with you at the bottom.
[1075.11s -> 1079.91s]  We don't typically listen to private conversations. I can't do this right now.
[1079.91s -> 1086.06s]  Kate, I'm sorry. I was just completely eavesdropping in front of you of your
[1086.06s -> 1093.78s]  private conversation. All right, let's go. I need to wake up. Head to the bathroom.
[1096.63s -> 1109.85s]  Bathroom. You don't want to pause menu, but okay. I am like drunk right now.
[1110.49s -> 1134.33s]  Where's that bathroom? Look at this one. It's going to go. Ready? One, two, three. Into the mirror.
[1143.48s -> 1166.57s]  What were you drinking? Did you have horns? Find Kate. Looks like your
[1167.29s -> 1185.88s]  sotsuwara wrote you a message. What did you do? What did you do? You did something. Help.
[1191.48s -> 1201.62s]  Where's the letter? Sorry, I got angry myself lately. Meet me in the dining room. Kate,
[1201.62s -> 1208.41s]  you used way too much paper for this. Now, the way to correct this would be to write it gigantically.
[1209.82s -> 1220.98s]  Like a second writer. I would not be as angry as I am now. Head to the dining car.
[1232.18s -> 1241.48s]  It's very difficult to navigate. All right. Wait, stop. Stop. Don't walk into the wall. I'm not moving.
[1248.18s -> 1254.89s]  Look out the window. Looks like it's going to rain. I guess the weather has a sense of humor.
[1255.45s -> 1261.24s]  Are you going to achieve it by looking out the fucking window?
[1262.62s -> 1265.82s]  God, they really tacked these on back in the 360 day. Remember this shit?
[1266.78s -> 1279.74s]  Oh yeah, this game has 120,000 achievements. Five points for shooting your first round.
[1280.46s -> 1311.58s]  Can I go? Can I pass this? Can I like go by? Excuse me. I'd like to pass. Can I like,
[1312.54s -> 1323.88s]  what do I have to do? Is this going to teach me how to like crouch? I actually have to. Are
[1323.88s -> 1344.20s]  you serious? Why wouldn't you just put your down to the leg? What's so funny over here? Hey. Hi,
[1344.20s -> 1371.66s]  guys. Yeah. I know this trick. They did this shit weekend at Bernie's. That guy's not real.
[1371.66s -> 1410.34s]  That guy's not alive. There's somebody up in the luggage cab. Are you on a phone? I'm just
[1410.34s -> 1425.46s]  rude. Oh, sorry. These old Soviet rail cars buck like shop shabonies. So who's this? I'll see you
[1425.46s -> 1435.99s]  around. I'm missing something, right? I'm missing something. That was like the oldest trick in the
[1435.99s -> 1439.27s]  book. That's the like I bumped into you and like my colleague came and like wrapped like something
[1439.27s -> 1456.78s]  that he backed back. What am I doing? What was I supposed to? I was supposed to find like the
[1456.78s -> 1470.62s]  dinner car. It's taking a lot more time than I thought it was going to take. Put it in there.
[1471.34s -> 1490.22s]  Oh, we got somebody in here. How are you? I'm a friendly bunch. Actually, I'm Canadian.
[1491.74s -> 1508.58s]  Fucking assholes. Appreciate. Oh, right this way, sir. Come on, tell me where to go. I must
[1508.58s -> 1518.41s]  see your ticket. I just dropped everything. I'm not going in there. You can't pass without your
[1518.41s -> 1521.21s]  ticket. Well, you just it's in there. Can you just like, can you go in there?
[1522.49s -> 1538.60s]  Can you like knock on the curtain to find your wife? What the fuck? That guy's waiting up there.
[1538.60s -> 1548.34s]  He's probably like, what the fuck's going on in here? This will help. Sir, did you get your ticket
[1548.34s -> 1561.24s]  yet? Shut up, man. This is cool. Which card should I? This card is your pass. This is very good.
[1561.24s -> 1573.86s]  You love your wife very much and she loves you. This is the present. All right, it's going to be
[1574.50s -> 1590.44s]  go on. Turn it. Fucking joker. This is your problem. Somewhere you have lost your way.
[1591.94s -> 1602.55s]  Next one's gonna be death. Don't worry. We still have future. Oh, my fucking god is the death card.
[1602.55s -> 1608.25s]  Did he get it? The alak, the alak is the ala was it the alchemist?
[1609.85s -> 1611.77s]  Somebody's giving like 60 fucking something.
[1614.38s -> 1627.34s]  If I like to religious give 69 something. Jesus. That's a lot. On top of the two plus hundred,
[1627.34s -> 1633.58s]  I think that you were responsible for already. Thank you. That is a shitload of subs. Oh,
[1634.30s -> 1638.14s]  yeah, sorry. I'm sorry. I just said there's something going on there. I had to do that real
[1638.14s -> 1654.76s]  quick. Always predict doom and gloom, but nothing comes of it. I mean, I just, I thought, I swear.
[1657.99s -> 1664.81s]  Dude, I'll give you 100 bucks if you eat that pen. All right, I can't even fucking look at it.
[1664.97s -> 1683.11s]  Let's go. How many cars are there? I probably shouldn't be holding like a hot coffee in my hand.
[1683.11s -> 1691.62s]  This is like a jump scare game. Right? Okay. This is the worst thing you could possibly do.
[1692.50s -> 1697.83s]  Did I ever tell you guys the idea that I wanted to do, but I never did it because I just I'm just
[1697.83s -> 1703.59s]  full of empty ideas. I wanted to play a horror game. This is back in the YouTube days. I want
[1703.59s -> 1709.35s]  to play a horror game and have various annoying things in my lap. Like I have to think of popcorn
[1709.35s -> 1714.23s]  that when I jump scare the popcorn goes up on me, get like a stand up mixer and be like making
[1714.23s -> 1717.75s]  fucking good cookies and batter and shit. And I've been another jump scare like, oh, the cookies and
[1717.75s -> 1742.65s]  batter went all over me. What am I doing here? Here's my ticket. Excuse me. I'm Canadian. Why
[1742.65s -> 1771.82s]  does this keep happening to me? Forward. No, go forward. Kate, Kate, where are you? Help. Help me.
[1771.90s -> 1781.59s]  I can't do it on my own. Is there blood? It's a lot on the train. Hold on. This is important.
[1781.59s -> 1812.81s]  I gotta get ready for this. Okay. I'm gonna go talk to security because you're just happening
[1812.81s -> 1834.10s]  back there. Can I do anything with this stuff? All right, I'll go in. Bartender joke. Anybody
[1834.10s -> 1844.57s]  need anything? All right, let's go in. Here we go. Scary horror game. I said I was going to play it
[1844.57s -> 1890.23s]  and I'm like, I'm pumped up. I'm hype. Oh shit. It's scorpion in the $12 skin. Get the fuck out
[1890.23s -> 1916.57s]  quick. That guy's got money. Get out of here. That's how tacked on these achievements are.
[1916.57s -> 1926.49s]  That achievement was just called the train. I didn't fucking do anything. The train. I got 10 points.
[1932.10s -> 1938.82s]  God, what about Kate?
[1938.82s -> 1948.50s]  Escaping from the train. It's right, I can get out right there.
[1956.38s -> 1970.38s]  Bleeding in blood. Where are you? Restricted. Restricted auto. There are some situations
[1970.38s -> 1979.42s]  when you won't be able to auto move. Okay. Where is this person? Oh, I found the exit.
[1983.50s -> 1991.50s]  Drop the jump. God, I really shouldn't be drunk doing this. I didn't think I was that drunk.
[1992.54s -> 2019.93s]  I knew it. Stay balanced? How is that not balanced? I was doing the pencil.
[2021.05s -> 2028.52s]  Do I have to put weight down on my right foot? Stay balanced.
[2040.52s -> 2053.69s]  Train. Okay, I gotta go left. Why can't I do auto movement? Okay, balance. Stay to the left.
[2054.57s -> 2075.77s]  Good. All right, let's go. Okay. Should I go try to get the secrets over here on the left?
[2076.49s -> 2101.66s]  There's no secret over here. This shit's gonna make me sick. All right, now where?
[2101.66s -> 2136.04s]  I'm good. I'm good. Stay, stay, stay, stay. Okay. Okay. He walked backwards off the train.
[2138.46s -> 2144.30s]  He walked backwards. I put my foot forward. You saw it. I walked fucking forward. Why can
[2144.30s -> 2172.87s]  you even walk backwards? Oh, no. I got Luigi. How do I run? The whole game that you're supposed
[2172.87s -> 2176.87s]  to go like put your foot forward to automatically move. Now I have to all of a sudden run?
[2182.10s -> 2186.62s]  All right. This is how you move the whole game. Now fucking sprint, dude. Hurry.
[2186.78s -> 2187.28s]  Hurry.
[2232.25s -> 2249.64s]  Achievement. Run for it. No. I'm just standing very close to the fire.
[2253.02s -> 2257.66s]  No. Why would you throw the phone? People always do that in fucking movies and TV shows.
[2257.66s -> 2263.26s]  What if it works? What if you get a signal over here? Like 100 feet that way.
[2267.10s -> 2269.98s]  In the middle of nowhere in a fucking cave. You relax.
[2270.78s -> 2275.42s]  Somebody's going to come for us. I mean at least I take pictures of shit on your phone.
[2276.14s -> 2278.94s]  Like document our trail so they can figure out like what happened.
[2281.50s -> 2285.34s]  And then once you document the whole trail throw it as fucking far as you can
[2285.34s -> 2288.30s]  and it'll get washed up with somebody going to decipher the photos and find you.
[2293.35s -> 2303.21s]  He thinks it's dangerous to go out there at night. I'm studying foreign languages.
[2303.93s -> 2311.37s]  Romanian is one of them. Great. Derailed into a cursed forest. This keeps getting better and better.
[2313.21s -> 2316.33s]  I thought that was the person in the fire.
[2319.30s -> 2322.10s]  I thought it was the person in the fire. I thought that guy was on fire.
[2323.30s -> 2338.06s]  Oh shit. I got too close. Let me lead the way. So we've got. We should stay together. The old man.
[2338.06s -> 2349.19s]  The train conductor. The badass. The college educated. The journalist. There's one more.
[2349.19s -> 2367.03s]  There's one more. What's the last one? I can't. I physically cannot see this. It's so blurry but
[2367.03s -> 2380.22s]  from back here. The funny guy. Wait is that me? Are we supposed to go over here?
[2380.22s -> 2391.72s]  I just felt something grab my.
[2395.80s -> 2400.68s]  Already. And then. Okay now we got some train conductor. We don't care apparently.
[2403.90s -> 2408.46s]  Nobody is upset about the fact that the train conductor just literally got sucked underneath.
[2408.46s -> 2431.70s]  A giant alligator. What? What? What? Get him off me. What's on me? I'm coming in leeches.
[2433.70s -> 2435.22s]  Oh no I can't do that right now.
[2449.06s -> 2452.82s]  All right if I just stood there. Would everybody have just gotten all their blood drain.
[2454.18s -> 2462.18s]  By the way you cannot slot off leeches. It doesn't work like that.
[2462.90s -> 2471.42s]  I sensed a presence behind me. Like I was being watched. But though I spun and looked often.
[2472.22s -> 2477.18s]  All that I could see was the perpetual gloom of the forest. But I'm certain of it.
[2477.82s -> 2483.18s]  Someone is next to go. I've been doing this long enough to know that I'm not just spooking myself.
[2484.62s -> 2488.78s]  I think this guy is next to go.
[2501.64s -> 2515.34s]  See he's first. No no no go forward. This bottle. I think there's someone up ahead.
[2515.34s -> 2531.99s]  Come on I'm always the last person. What did you guys see? Is there a person right here?
[2534.78s -> 2537.94s]  Oh it's the fortune teller. Okay.
[2550.66s -> 2553.14s]  I want somebody else to do their fortune. It's just a bunch of gold.
[2553.86s -> 2558.10s]  Oh it's the fortune card. It's the gold card. You're gonna make a lot of money.
[2558.10s -> 2562.87s]  They're like oh cool. They get on the fucking helicopter at the end and leave.
[2563.67s -> 2573.37s]  What the hell is going on? Is it a hub?
[2599.43s -> 2604.31s]  All right let's talk. Don't punch guy in head. I saw interact.
[2605.27s -> 2609.61s]  Well now that you made it seem like it. Now that you gave me an opportunity.
[2610.41s -> 2616.25s]  Like I kind of have to know. Shit traveling through Europe seemed like such a good idea.
[2619.37s -> 2625.50s]  You can't. You cannot. I know everybody wanted me to try so I did.
[2632.66s -> 2639.02s]  It's a fortune teller went down here. That's what I'm understanding right?
[2640.06s -> 2665.42s]  Just do it for me. I don't want to walk down this. Oh god did that one just move? What's in here?
[2668.09s -> 2672.82s]  Is a body in here? Who is this?
[2690.50s -> 2692.98s]  This is not working. Do I need a weapon or something?
[2707.29s -> 2717.21s]  I did it. All right so that doesn't count. That negates each other. Oh god just go.
[2719.46s -> 2724.46s]  How many times do I have to punch something in the face? Is there a dodge mechanic that I didn't see?
[2731.66s -> 2746.12s]  I'll handle this. This cannot be happening. Nice got it. All right anything else in here?
[2747.08s -> 2754.90s]  Health potion? Okay let's go. Here comes a jump scare. Here it comes. Just want to make sure.
[2763.27s -> 2773.62s]  Got it. Did you just lock me in here? What's wrong with you? Why would you do that?
[2774.34s -> 2788.71s]  Block attacks? How do you block? I'm just gonna go for it.
[2797.02s -> 2806.54s]  Even doing anything? Why is it still fighting?
[2817.64s -> 2823.82s]  I you get rid of the brain. You get rid of the head and it's gone. What?
[2839.46s -> 2842.95s]  Your brain is in their legs. I didn't even get the fucking knife.
[2845.11s -> 2853.90s]  No I'm getting out of this. I'm fucking winning this. No we're not next. We're not going to the next one.
[2854.62s -> 2873.24s]  I have to kill these three zombies. Okay here we go. Here we go. Let's do it. Get out here.
[2877.40s -> 2911.42s]  What armor for? Good. Go. Open the door. Out. Forward. Just go forward. Watch out. Watch out. They're gonna come up with us.
[2912.54s -> 2937.77s]  This is fucking ridiculous man. I'm just gonna. No. What? What?
[2942.78s -> 2965.74s]  Can I leave? Open the door quick. All right. Out. Out. Out. Out. We're good right?
[2966.70s -> 2994.22s]  Something's coming from behind me. What happened? Escape? Oh he's got acid.
[2994.94s -> 3028.46s]  How do I get out of here? Iron pipe? Give me that. Get the pipe. Okay good. Out. Just go. You kick your enemies.
[3043.10s -> 3070.76s]  What the fuck? No I'm getting out of this fucking cemetery. Not yet. Not yet. I gotta get out of
[3070.76s -> 3086.23s]  the cemetery first. Here we go. I'm getting out of here. What are you doing? Go forward. Why am I moving
[3086.23s -> 3122.74s]  backwards? I need that pipe. Man why is there so much acid? Go forward. I don't even care.
[3124.47s -> 3127.27s]  All right. I'm just gonna kill this thing. I'm not gonna do the tutorial kick.
[3129.69s -> 3170.06s]  Now focus on the person over that way. They're this way. Turn. What? Put your hands up. Watch out.
[3170.06s -> 3211.61s]  The chest. A bunch of chests. How do I open these? Oh shit. This is not good.
[3229.29s -> 3243.40s]  No. I have to get out of here. I have to get out of this. I have to.
[3247.80s -> 3276.23s]  Okay give me the pipe. I still am moving backwards for some dumb reason.
[3277.19s -> 3286.95s]  Hey shit. Hey shit. Shit. Get the machete. What? Hey shit. Get the machete. What do you mean? Hey shit.
[3287.91s -> 3305.93s]  Where's the machete? Hey shit. Get the machete. I don't see a machete. Hey shit.
[3306.65s -> 3315.03s]  Lower the difficulty. Just too late. I'm going for it. All right. I can do it. All right. I'm gonna make
[3315.03s -> 3332.89s]  it. This is where we go. Fight. Just kill them. Hands up. Why are you backing up?
[3354.44s -> 3383.30s]  Go. Hey shit. Hey shit. Where is it? Is it over here? I don't see a machete. What's that?
[3384.26s -> 3411.83s]  Iron pipe. I got two pipes now. Can I do both hands? Let's go. All right. This is where I died
[3411.83s -> 3436.09s]  last time. Hey shit. What's going on?
[3436.49s -> 3445.96s]  There is some fatigue in this.
[3448.04s -> 3449.96s]  It just suddenly came back to life.
[3455.05s -> 3459.38s]  Where the fuck is it? Man.
[3468.02s -> 3471.62s]  I didn't kill this guy. Get rid of the arm.
[3472.58s -> 3474.58s]  It's enough to order to make me forget about this job.
[3475.62s -> 3476.82s]  Yes. Cut its handle.
[3478.98s -> 3491.94s]  Did I win? Oh my god. Oh my god. What the fuck?
[3492.74s -> 3498.60s]  Let's go.
[3515.40s -> 3531.02s]  Still. Where is he? Where is my weapon? I can't see. Knife arm. Get it.
[3540.15s -> 3571.82s]  Can I please be done with this? Oh, thank God. No. Jesus. Okay, that was
[3571.82s -> 3598.07s]  That was fucking brutal.
[3598.07s -> 3610.05s]  He's doing a lot of good Arnold noises there.
[3610.05s -> 3626.05s]  He looks like a fucking jester.
[3626.05s -> 3626.89s]  Oh, shia!
[3631.06s -> 3641.34s]  Uh-oh, it's the mad doctor.
[3641.34s -> 3643.18s]  That guy had pretty weak arms.
[3643.18s -> 3646.62s]  That was like, he was doing like a little tap.
[3656.70s -> 3659.56s]  What is this for, right?
[3659.56s -> 3660.76s]  They always have like the crazy,
[3660.76s -> 3664.08s]  fucking butcher doctor psycho in all these things.
[3664.08s -> 3665.56s]  What are you doing this for?
[3676.03s -> 3677.35s]  That wasn't an experiment.
[3678.95s -> 3680.75s]  He just put an ax in that person's head.
[3680.75s -> 3683.03s]  That was not like, oh, and I'm doing a test
[3683.03s -> 3685.35s]  on the globulation of human skulls.
[3701.39s -> 3704.71s]  He was always fucked up using the background.
[3704.71s -> 3715.06s]  Why can't it be like, like a top 10 song?
[3715.06s -> 3717.14s]  He waves first.
[3717.14s -> 3718.78s]  Wait, instead of waving, just get it done.
[3718.78s -> 3720.38s]  Like, oh, hey, I'm about to say,
[3721.30s -> 3722.14s]  just remember me, right?
[3722.14s -> 3723.46s]  I'm the fucking old guy.
[3735.90s -> 3737.98s]  Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop,
[3737.98s -> 3739.58s]  put it down, put it down.
[3739.58s -> 3740.42s]  I wanna go back in there.
[3740.42s -> 3742.38s]  Probably like an item.
[3742.38s -> 3746.74s]  Watch out.
[3746.74s -> 3750.33s]  Is there like a saw or an ax or something?
[3750.33s -> 3754.71s]  You gotta have something in here, right?
[3754.71s -> 3757.84s]  Nothing?
[3757.84s -> 3766.23s]  God damn it.
[3766.23s -> 3767.11s]  Take the hand.
[3767.11s -> 3768.03s]  What do you mean take the hand?
[3768.03s -> 3769.59s]  I can't take the fucking hand.
[3773.12s -> 3775.28s]  I'm very indecisive, old man, I'm sorry.
[3783.01s -> 3784.81s]  You can't, you can't, guys, you can't.
[3790.07s -> 3791.27s]  All right, where to now?
[3793.09s -> 3801.33s]  Let's let the game tell us.
[3801.33s -> 3802.17s]  Monsters in here?
[3802.17s -> 3813.94s]  Does he have a weapon?
[3813.94s -> 3824.10s]  I'm all right, I'll be fine.
[3824.10s -> 3825.70s]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[3827.70s -> 3829.94s]  Let me help you down.
[3829.94s -> 3840.33s]  Was this person just saying that?
[3840.33s -> 3845.34s]  Put it down.
[3845.34s -> 3846.82s]  All right, I just, I activate something.
[3846.82s -> 3847.66s]  Ah!
[3847.66s -> 3853.86s]  Ah!
[3853.86s -> 3854.70s]  Ah!
[3854.70s -> 3855.54s]  Ah!
[3855.54s -> 3856.38s]  Ah!
[3856.38s -> 3857.22s]  Ah!
[3857.22s -> 3858.06s]  Ah!
[3858.06s -> 3858.90s]  Oops.
[3858.90s -> 3859.74s]  Ah!
[3860.34s -> 3862.18s]  He's trying to save me, man.
[3862.18s -> 3872.52s]  I'm just trying to save you.
[3872.52s -> 3877.10s]  I'm surprised that you can actually do that.
[3877.10s -> 3878.46s]  No, no, don't go back in this room.
[3878.46s -> 3880.26s]  I don't need to be in there, no.
[3882.89s -> 3889.07s]  I want the old man to go in there first.
[3889.07s -> 3890.27s]  No weapons, just go.
[3909.12s -> 3922.63s]  Okay, what if I don't?
[3922.63s -> 3923.95s]  Is it safe to go over there?
[3927.48s -> 3928.56s]  I can't, okay.
[3928.56s -> 3931.76s]  So what do I do now?
[3931.76s -> 3935.34s]  There's a key around his neck.
[3935.34s -> 3936.42s]  Key's a key.
[3936.42s -> 3937.46s]  Reach for the key.
[3940.56s -> 3943.43s]  I got the key.
[3944.51s -> 3946.78s]  Key for unlocking a closed door.
[3946.78s -> 3947.62s]  No shit.
[3955.86s -> 3960.05s]  All right.
[3960.05s -> 3961.85s]  All right, I hear another, another person.
[3964.49s -> 3968.50s]  Device over here.
[3969.62s -> 3978.42s]  What's this do?
[3978.42s -> 3980.94s]  Should I go through the hole?
[3980.94s -> 3982.18s]  There is a hole right there.
[3982.18s -> 3983.58s]  No, can't even go through it.
[3999.98s -> 4005.56s]  A lot of walking.
[4005.56s -> 4006.40s]  There's gonna be something in here.
[4006.40s -> 4009.60s]  There's gonna be another person in here.
[4009.60s -> 4015.80s]  Downstairs?
[4015.80s -> 4027.17s]  This is a giant hallway.
[4031.29s -> 4037.39s]  Could be another survivor.
[4039.11s -> 4039.95s]  Jesus.
[4040.95s -> 4042.87s]  I didn't even get to you.
[4042.87s -> 4043.71s]  I'm dying.
[4043.71s -> 4046.03s]  I didn't even get to fucking have it.
[4046.03s -> 4048.15s]  One minute with any NPCs.
[4051.83s -> 4054.63s]  Every single NPC is gone in less than a minute or two.
[4068.20s -> 4071.16s]  I wanna get close enough to feel the fucking wind on my face.
[4076.65s -> 4077.81s]  Oh, that's close.
[4087.33s -> 4089.29s]  The tip of my nose is gone.
[4102.63s -> 4115.81s]  Really?
[4115.81s -> 4125.98s]  There's a lot of ways you can die in this game.
[4125.98s -> 4128.18s]  All right, survival lab, let's go.
[4128.18s -> 4135.59s]  Oh, do I get to fight the doctor?
[4135.59s -> 4136.43s]  I probably am.
[4143.82s -> 4144.66s]  I get to fight.
[4147.14s -> 4148.18s]  This is the worst part about this game.
[4148.18s -> 4150.22s]  It's the actual fighting.
[4150.22s -> 4152.14s]  Everything else is like kind of cool,
[4152.14s -> 4154.38s]  but the fighting is the worst.
[4156.78s -> 4158.98s]  Pick the flasher, my quarry.
[4158.98s -> 4160.54s]  A scholar hailing from Ingolstadt.
[4161.74s -> 4164.22s]  An authority in medicine, science, philosophy,
[4164.22s -> 4166.62s]  history, and more besides.
[4166.62s -> 4169.22s]  The purportedly brilliant man vanished without warning,
[4169.22s -> 4170.62s]  according to my client.
[4170.62s -> 4171.46s]  How many screens?
[4171.46s -> 4172.98s]  I'm curiously attracted to my neighbor,
[4172.98s -> 4174.74s]  who, while not related to me,
[4174.74s -> 4178.22s]  feels to her urgent need to have information.
[4178.22s -> 4181.02s]  But sympathy serves no purpose to an investigator.
[4181.02s -> 4182.46s]  It only clouds judgment.
[4184.27s -> 4186.59s]  Besides, she played generously in advance.
[4187.87s -> 4191.21s]  Investigate yourself in the middle.
[4191.21s -> 4192.05s]  Can I reach?
[4193.61s -> 4194.45s]  Turn this way.
[4205.03s -> 4206.35s]  What's that?
[4206.35s -> 4213.70s]  Schloss, schloes, scalpel.
[4213.70s -> 4216.46s]  A surgical scalpel to be hurled at enemies.
[4216.46s -> 4218.46s]  It's throwing knives?
[4218.46s -> 4232.01s]  All right, easy.
[4232.01s -> 4237.81s]  Straight down here.
[4237.81s -> 4238.65s]  What's the rhyme or reason to this?
[4238.65s -> 4250.47s]  Can I just throw them at their heads or something?
[4250.47s -> 4253.38s]  This is, I love these.
[4253.38s -> 4261.44s]  You don't even have to fight anything, it's great.
[4261.44s -> 4264.31s]  I just gotta get to the first boss.
[4264.39s -> 4267.23s]  When I get to the first boss, we'll go to the next one.
[4267.23s -> 4281.71s]  But I gotta get to the first boss.
[4281.71s -> 4285.15s]  Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up.
[4285.15s -> 4285.99s]  Put your hands up.
[4285.99s -> 4287.87s]  I don't know why you're not putting them up.
[4287.87s -> 4294.62s]  Who the fuck is she?
[4299.90s -> 4301.30s]  God damn it.
[4301.30s -> 4303.18s]  Okay, download the hatch.
[4309.46s -> 4318.26s]  Why, I, yeah, it's them, yeah.
[4318.26s -> 4320.10s]  First boss is gonna be the doctor.
[4320.10s -> 4321.38s]  I'm gonna kill the doctor.
[4324.77s -> 4325.77s]  Spitter on the right.
[4339.74s -> 4340.74s]  Who made this game?
[4342.82s -> 4350.86s]  What company did this?
[4350.86s -> 4352.34s]  You can't ask that question.
[4358.41s -> 4365.02s]  One shot, good.
[4365.02s -> 4365.86s]  Who's next?
[4369.76s -> 4371.64s]  There's somebody behind me.
[4371.64s -> 4383.44s]  Somebody's in a fucking stall.
[4383.44s -> 4384.28s]  What?
[4384.28s -> 4385.12s]  The smell.
[4385.12s -> 4386.92s]  Go into the, you flush the toilet?
[4386.92s -> 4389.01s]  Ugh.
[4389.01s -> 4390.01s]  What, pick up?
[4391.01s -> 4392.09s]  Why'd I put my hands in here?
[4392.09s -> 4392.93s]  Oh!
[4398.00s -> 4399.24s]  I'm glad I tried to look in here
[4399.24s -> 4403.41s]  because there's no way I would've ever gone over there.
[4403.41s -> 4406.37s]  I would have never in a million years ever opened that.
[4408.29s -> 4409.57s]  And I would've freaked out,
[4409.57s -> 4412.49s]  I would've been like, this game's fucking stupid.
[4412.49s -> 4414.33s]  I mean, the game is, this game is fucking,
[4414.33s -> 4415.29s]  this game is stupid.
[4415.29s -> 4426.10s]  But I would've been like even worse than that.
[4426.10s -> 4429.46s]  It's not bad though.
[4429.46s -> 4433.21s]  It really isn't.
[4433.21s -> 4437.04s]  It's not the worst game I've ever played.
[4437.04s -> 4438.20s]  I mean, it's up there, the top like,
[4438.20s -> 4440.32s]  probably top like 50 worst games I've ever played.
[4440.32s -> 4444.31s]  But it's not the top 10 worst games I've ever played.
[4444.31s -> 4446.03s]  Being in the top like 50 worst game ever
[4446.03s -> 4447.27s]  means you're like, probably like a,
[4447.31s -> 4453.19s]  I don't know, like a five and a half, six.
[4453.19s -> 4454.11s]  No, that's not even fair.
[4454.11s -> 4459.30s]  I wouldn't put this in the top 50 worst games ever.
[4459.30s -> 4461.26s]  I'd put this in like the top.
[4461.26s -> 4463.02s]  I'm gonna be, oh, all right.
[4463.02s -> 4470.26s]  I'm gonna be quiet.
[4470.26s -> 4480.68s]  There's no way I'm gonna get through this.
[4480.68s -> 4483.00s]  Oh my God, just die.
[4483.00s -> 4484.69s]  Okay.
[4484.69s -> 4487.07s]  So,
[4487.07s -> 4504.27s]  three, two, go cross.
[4504.27s -> 4509.56s]  Oh my God!
[4509.56s -> 4511.28s]  Focus, focus on this, focus!
[4511.28s -> 4518.48s]  Focus before he spits you!
[4518.48s -> 4520.65s]  Oh my God.
[4520.65s -> 4521.49s]  What?
[4521.49s -> 4522.61s]  No, go forward.
[4528.32s -> 4529.44s]  All right, who's next?
[4529.44s -> 4533.82s]  Is that it?
[4533.82s -> 4535.11s]  Okay.
[4535.11s -> 4537.35s]  Let's go.
[4537.35s -> 4539.03s]  Saw, saw, saw, saw.
[4539.03s -> 4541.91s]  No, I'm not just gonna get hit by the saw.
[4541.91s -> 4548.00s]  All right, I've made it through already.
[4548.00s -> 4551.68s]  I can't get killed by every single trap in the whole game.
[4551.68s -> 4553.24s]  Okay?
[4553.24s -> 4571.15s]  We gotta put our foot down somewhere.
[4571.15s -> 4572.23s]  Fuck, not good.
[4592.29s -> 4607.74s]  Just punch him in the chest.
[4607.74s -> 4612.49s]  All right, go.
[4612.49s -> 4613.33s]  Nobody else down here, no?
[4613.33s -> 4614.17s]  Good.
[4614.17s -> 4626.69s]  Up.
[4626.73s -> 4627.77s]  Wait, what is that?
[4627.77s -> 4632.90s]  What's that thing?
[4632.90s -> 4635.62s]  Is someone trying to get my attention?
[4635.62s -> 4637.86s]  Is there somebody standing right here?
[4637.86s -> 4641.39s]  Did you throw that all the way from down there?
[4641.39s -> 4652.36s]  Holy shit, man, that's pretty impressive.
[4652.36s -> 4654.44s]  Get the knife!
[4654.44s -> 4655.44s]  Get the knife!
[4664.14s -> 4670.35s]  Shit.
[4670.35s -> 4673.26s]  Wait, hold on.
[4673.26s -> 4674.86s]  Are you going over there to fight the guy
[4674.86s -> 4675.98s]  that just spit at you?
[4688.50s -> 4696.58s]  Kill that one in the middle.
[4696.58s -> 4702.76s]  I gotta get rid of that.
[4702.76s -> 4711.60s]  Where's the knife?
[4711.60s -> 4712.44s]  Oh damn it!
[4712.44s -> 4714.32s]  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[4714.32s -> 4715.68s]  No, what are you doing?
[4715.68s -> 4716.92s]  Stop!
[4716.92s -> 4718.36s]  What am I doing?
[4718.36s -> 4720.79s]  I'm not doing this.
[4720.79s -> 4723.19s]  I'm not doing this at all.
[4723.19s -> 4724.55s]  He just helped me get through.
[4724.55s -> 4728.85s]  Thank you, sir.
[4728.85s -> 4739.14s]  Open the door, open the door.
[4739.14s -> 4739.98s]  Ready to keep?
[4745.18s -> 4746.30s]  Okay, no, that was me.
[4749.70s -> 4751.74s]  Looks like this door needs power.
[4752.62s -> 4754.66s]  Looks like this door needs power.
[4754.66s -> 4756.98s]  I need to turn the power on, of course I do.
[4756.98s -> 4761.78s]  There's gotta be something in here I can use.
[4762.34s -> 4763.70s]  In this little office area.
[4764.70s -> 4768.10s]  Knife or a board or a plank or a something.
[4768.10s -> 4768.94s]  A piece of wood.
[4770.67s -> 4772.42s]  A two by four.
[4772.42s -> 4778.78s]  Or a, what the hell is in here?
[4778.78s -> 4779.78s]  Have I been down here?
[4788.27s -> 4792.33s]  I'm just checking them.
[4792.33s -> 4794.17s]  Volatile test tube.
[4794.17s -> 4795.01s]  They're gonna come alive.
[4795.01s -> 4802.38s]  I gotta get something in this room right now.
[4802.38s -> 4807.25s]  Okay, filled with unstable chemicals.
[4807.25s -> 4808.09s]  What's that?
[4808.09s -> 4810.08s]  Test tube?
[4810.08s -> 4813.76s]  Okay, I've got like a explosion or something.
[4813.80s -> 4826.26s]  Not bad.
[4826.26s -> 4828.51s]  What are you saying, what are you saying?
[4828.51s -> 4829.87s]  Hey, shit.
[4829.87s -> 4832.63s]  Tape, tape, you don't need to listen to the tape.
[4832.63s -> 4844.21s]  That's not a problem.
[4844.21s -> 4845.65s]  I can turn the power on
[4845.65s -> 4847.57s]  and then get back up there and open that door
[4847.57s -> 4854.97s]  and then throw acid and the doctor's fix it.
[4854.97s -> 4856.22s]  Hold on.
[4856.22s -> 4857.66s]  More test tubes, gimme them.
[4859.97s -> 4862.22s]  21.
[4862.22s -> 4864.02s]  Here's the generator.
[4864.02s -> 4865.90s]  So this is where this game's gonna become stupid
[4865.90s -> 4867.90s]  because I'm gonna turn the generator on
[4867.90s -> 4869.66s]  and then 20 enemies are gonna spawn.
[4872.74s -> 4873.74s]  Get ready for that.
[4880.50s -> 4882.62s]  Okay, power's up and running.
[4882.62s -> 4884.66s]  Maybe that door upstairs is open now.
[4886.56s -> 4888.40s]  Yeah, of course.
[4888.40s -> 4890.25s]  Another electrify.
[4890.25s -> 4892.21s]  I can phase it, I just electrified it.
[4900.46s -> 4901.30s]  What's that?
[4901.30s -> 4902.14s]  Steroid arms.
[4902.14s -> 4905.10s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, gimme that.
[4905.10s -> 4908.10s]  I'm gonna wait for them to come down here.
[4908.10s -> 4911.21s]  Where is this other one?
[4911.21s -> 4912.49s]  No, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[4912.49s -> 4927.50s]  Don't stand in it.
[4927.50s -> 4929.62s]  Oh no.
[4929.62s -> 4934.11s]  I can't go that way.
[4934.11s -> 4937.11s]  No, I want the knife on me.
[4937.11s -> 4940.23s]  Stop moving.
[4941.11s -> 4947.44s]  Okay, I can't go that way.
[4947.44s -> 4948.76s]  Break your bones.
[4948.76s -> 4950.08s]  Move bones.
[4950.08s -> 4982.46s]  Can I fit in here?
[4982.46s -> 4984.26s]  Can I fucking kill this guy?
[4985.86s -> 4988.46s]  There are spikes behind me, by the way.
[4990.48s -> 4991.96s]  I don't wanna walk forward.
[4991.96s -> 4993.08s]  What the fuck?
[5012.18s -> 5028.48s]  Did he just spill on me?
[5028.48s -> 5033.34s]  God damn it.
[5033.34s -> 5038.80s]  I wanna go backwards.
[5038.80s -> 5045.86s]  There's something on the ground right here on my right.
[5045.86s -> 5046.70s]  Ah!
[5048.94s -> 5056.98s]  Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[5057.02s -> 5059.83s]  Just scraping my back.
[5059.83s -> 5061.94s]  Okay.
[5065.06s -> 5066.22s]  What the fuck?
[5066.22s -> 5067.50s]  Step forward.
[5067.50s -> 5068.34s]  Forward.
[5073.78s -> 5074.70s]  I know they're behind me.
[5074.70s -> 5085.85s]  I'm trying to go forward.
[5085.85s -> 5087.41s]  Thank God.
[5087.41s -> 5088.53s]  I have to kill the first boss.
[5088.53s -> 5091.01s]  I refuse to go next until the first boss is dead.
[5102.54s -> 5103.38s]  Stop.
[5103.38s -> 5104.22s]  Back up.
[5104.22s -> 5109.07s]  Give me the thing on the ground right here.
[5109.07s -> 5111.98s]  Where is it?
[5111.98s -> 5112.82s]  Knife.
[5112.82s -> 5114.38s]  Oh my God, game.
[5118.02s -> 5118.86s]  Whoa.
[5126.90s -> 5130.06s]  All right, I want to pick up the thing on the ground.
[5130.06s -> 5131.26s]  Oh my God.
[5131.26s -> 5133.50s]  The millions of dollars that this took to make.
[5159.75s -> 5170.10s]  Pick it up now.
[5170.10s -> 5170.94s]  Okay, I'm good.
[5170.94s -> 5171.78s]  Let's go.
[5171.78s -> 5177.52s]  Enter the hole.
[5177.52s -> 5179.32s]  That's a spit guy, spit, spit, spit.
[5187.74s -> 5189.46s]  Okay.
[5192.00s -> 5193.56s]  Don't bump into that.
[5193.56s -> 5196.60s]  Don't bump, I'm fucking standing still.
[5198.66s -> 5220.09s]  Get me the fuck out of this place.
[5220.09s -> 5221.57s]  Seems to be closed off.
[5223.66s -> 5229.46s]  Chainsaw.
[5229.46s -> 5231.18s]  All right, I'm going to get the chainsaw.
[5231.18s -> 5233.37s]  Wait, what's that?
[5233.37s -> 5235.63s]  What is this thing?
[5235.63s -> 5237.97s]  This is the thing on the wall.
[5237.97s -> 5238.81s]  Can I do that?
[5238.81s -> 5243.34s]  No.
[5243.34s -> 5249.60s]  Where's the chainsaw?
[5249.60s -> 5250.60s]  What is that?
[5250.60s -> 5251.88s]  Bloody chainsaw?
[5252.76s -> 5254.92s]  Ooh, wow, you're not lying.
[5254.92s -> 5264.23s]  I thought that was a gas can.
[5264.23s -> 5276.07s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[5276.07s -> 5280.60s]  I think I heard something.
[5280.60s -> 5291.18s]  How do I turn it on?
[5291.18s -> 5292.58s]  This thing sucks.
[5293.70s -> 5294.54s]  This thing sucks.
[5294.54s -> 5296.02s]  Get me out of this.
[5296.02s -> 5296.86s]  Climb up.
[5296.86s -> 5297.70s]  Up.
[5297.70s -> 5304.21s]  Climb.
[5304.21s -> 5305.05s]  Okay.
[5305.05s -> 5308.94s]  Then we, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[5308.94s -> 5315.18s]  What do I do?
[5315.18s -> 5329.04s]  I would love it if you would walk forward.
[5329.04s -> 5330.44s]  Oh shit.
[5330.44s -> 5332.00s]  No.
[5332.00s -> 5333.44s]  Okay, I got to be careful.
[5346.09s -> 5352.53s]  Okay, there's another one right here, right?
[5352.53s -> 5354.53s]  This is a, it's a, I knew it.
[5355.17s -> 5357.05s]  That's why I was waiting.
[5357.05s -> 5359.97s]  Okay, now this is where we turn it on
[5359.97s -> 5361.73s]  and we just drag it across the screen
[5361.73s -> 5363.17s]  and hit everybody here.
[5363.17s -> 5364.17s]  Okay?
[5364.17s -> 5365.41s]  That's what's gonna happen.
[5365.41s -> 5366.81s]  All right, are we aware of that?
[5366.81s -> 5367.65s]  We are?
[5367.65s -> 5374.17s]  Good.
[5374.17s -> 5376.82s]  There's so many people in this room.
[5376.82s -> 5382.01s]  How am I supposed to do this?
[5382.01s -> 5393.35s]  These guys have like electro-zapper things.
[5393.35s -> 5394.39s]  This guy ain't doing shit over here,
[5394.39s -> 5402.45s]  but he's freaking me out.
[5402.45s -> 5405.32s]  What?
[5405.32s -> 5406.16s]  Where?
[5406.16s -> 5409.22s]  What happened?
[5409.22s -> 5412.02s]  I think I have to run for it.
[5412.06s -> 5416.35s]  Straight for there, right?
[5416.35s -> 5417.47s]  I can't read what you guys are saying.
[5417.47s -> 5418.79s]  You're probably giving me some really good advice right now,
[5418.79s -> 5423.85s]  but I can't see it.
[5423.85s -> 5427.52s]  God damn it.
[5427.52s -> 5428.76s]  They're on like this interval.
[5428.76s -> 5430.20s]  I'm gonna have to just walk.
[5438.99s -> 5446.68s]  Hey!
[5446.68s -> 5448.78s]  Ah!
[5448.78s -> 5452.04s]  Ah!
[5452.04s -> 5460.87s]  Get it, get it, get it, get it!
[5460.87s -> 5462.51s]  All right, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[5462.51s -> 5469.09s]  You see?
[5469.09s -> 5469.93s]  What's he doing?
[5477.95s -> 5486.09s]  Ah!
[5486.09s -> 5487.89s]  Why do I have to be so drunk?
[5489.09s -> 5490.45s]  All right, he's gonna kill me.
[5490.45s -> 5494.23s]  He's gonna kill me.
[5494.23s -> 5495.19s]  He's gonna kill me with that thing.
[5495.19s -> 5514.52s]  It hurts, it's still, I gotta move.
[5514.52s -> 5515.68s]  Oh my God.
[5515.68s -> 5526.62s]  Oh my God.
[5526.62s -> 5529.78s]  Excuse me, excuse me.
[5529.78s -> 5542.26s]  Excuse me.
[5542.26s -> 5543.86s]  Oh, this got in my eye.
[5543.86s -> 5544.70s]  I'm lying.
[5550.19s -> 5553.05s]  Here comes first boss.
[5553.05s -> 5556.06s]  Fish, am I gonna fish Comet?
[5556.06s -> 5557.62s]  The movement's fucked up because of,
[5557.62s -> 5559.32s]  what are you talking about?
[5559.32s -> 5564.48s]  Escape with your life.
[5564.48s -> 5566.02s]  What's that?
[5566.02s -> 5576.02s]  Vase.
[5576.02s -> 5579.04s]  Why would I wanna use this as a weapon?
[5579.04s -> 5579.88s]  All right, where's the doctor?
[5579.88s -> 5585.54s]  Let me smash this man's head.
[5585.54s -> 5586.78s]  Let me just sneak up behind the doctor
[5586.94s -> 5588.38s]  and bash him with this thing.
[5606.49s -> 5607.65s]  So those can explode.
[5610.16s -> 5620.96s]  Sure thing.
[5620.96s -> 5626.06s]  I'm just gonna walk by him.
[5626.06s -> 5632.20s]  Just get over there.
[5632.20s -> 5633.20s]  I'm just walking.
[5633.20s -> 5634.04s]  I don't even care.
[5634.04s -> 5647.69s]  There's no points, you don't level up.
[5647.69s -> 5648.53s]  Thing.
[5651.06s -> 5652.38s]  There's no level up system.
[5652.38s -> 5653.54s]  There's no way, who cares?
[5653.54s -> 5664.09s]  Just try to get around him.
[5664.09s -> 5666.41s]  There are points you do level up.
[5666.41s -> 5667.33s]  That's horseshit.
[5669.40s -> 5670.24s]  No, they aren't.
[5670.24s -> 5671.08s]  No, there are not.
[5674.69s -> 5682.94s]  What's that?
[5682.94s -> 5688.68s]  Somebody gonna eat in one of those things.
[5688.68s -> 5696.70s]  What are you doing?
[5696.70s -> 5698.62s]  This game kind of reminds me of
[5698.62s -> 5701.10s]  if House of the Dead fell down the stairs.
[5705.74s -> 5717.94s]  What is he talking about?
[5717.94s -> 5718.78s]  There you go.
[5718.78s -> 5719.70s]  He's gonna come out in one of these.
[5719.70s -> 5720.66s]  Oh no, watch out.
[5726.42s -> 5727.26s]  No, all right.
[5727.26s -> 5729.58s]  Well, no trope.
[5729.58s -> 5740.58s]  Let's go.
[5740.58s -> 5741.42s]  Here we go.
[5741.42s -> 5742.26s]  This is it.
[5742.26s -> 5744.82s]  This is the reason why I've been playing for this long.
[5748.10s -> 5749.30s]  Sorry.
[5749.30s -> 5751.03s]  It's you.
[5751.07s -> 5752.77s]  Thank God.
[5752.77s -> 5754.44s]  You're alive.
[5754.44s -> 5755.76s]  We've got to get out of here.
[5755.76s -> 5759.53s]  Let's get right back in the face.
[5759.53s -> 5760.37s]  All right, well, remember,
[5760.37s -> 5761.37s]  how long has she been on screen for?
[5761.37s -> 5764.00s]  One minute, two minutes?
[5764.00s -> 5765.24s]  We are at that threshold
[5765.24s -> 5780.57s]  where she's gonna get thrown off the bridge here.
[5780.57s -> 5782.21s]  The bad guy's gonna crawl up
[5782.21s -> 5783.77s]  and just put both of his hands like this
[5783.77s -> 5785.17s]  and just squirt your head.
[5797.06s -> 5799.16s]  Here we go.
[5799.16s -> 5800.40s]  The piano's gonna fall.
[5817.74s -> 5819.58s]  And like a snake.
[5819.58s -> 5820.42s]  Yeah.
[5821.34s -> 5822.42s]  Right through the chest.
[5823.26s -> 5827.42s]  Just like.
[5827.42s -> 5842.14s]  Quiet, don't move.
[5842.14s -> 5843.78s]  This guy's name isn't Ernest?
[5848.83s -> 5850.71s]  His name's fucking Ernest.
[5853.08s -> 5854.48s]  That's not scary.
[5854.48s -> 5860.41s]  That's not scary at all.
[5860.41s -> 5870.98s]  Oh, you're not pretty stupid.
[5870.98s -> 5872.83s]  Stupid.
[5872.83s -> 5880.22s]  Whoa.
[5880.22s -> 5881.06s]  Uh-oh, hold on.
[5881.06s -> 5882.26s]  Be careful.
[5882.26s -> 5884.96s]  He's gonna turn around.
[5884.96s -> 5886.45s]  Quick.
[5886.45s -> 5890.05s]  Take the phone.
[5890.05s -> 5905.33s]  Put your phone on silent.
[5905.33s -> 5906.17s]  Really?
[5908.56s -> 5913.74s]  Can I move?
[5913.74s -> 5922.32s]  I guess.
[5922.32s -> 5926.02s]  Where'd she go?
[5926.02s -> 5939.21s]  No, go this way.
[5939.21s -> 5940.05s]  I think you're gonna,
[5940.05s -> 5940.89s]  you went over here?
[5940.89s -> 5945.66s]  There you are, okay.
[5945.66s -> 5946.50s]  Fucking easy.
[5960.51s -> 5962.54s]  So what do we do now?
[5962.54s -> 5963.62s]  Knife?
[5969.26s -> 5970.10s]  I told you.
[5970.10s -> 5971.18s]  Hand.
[5971.18s -> 5972.74s]  I knew it!
[5972.74s -> 5977.74s]  Squish!
[5977.74s -> 5979.58s]  Not even two minutes.
[5979.62s -> 5981.50s]  Not even two minutes on screen.
[5981.50s -> 5997.08s]  Count it.
[5997.08s -> 6009.34s]  Give me that.
[6009.34s -> 6011.14s]  No, let him bite me.
[6011.14s -> 6011.98s]  Come on.
[6013.42s -> 6014.26s]  Fucking take it.
[6018.75s -> 6020.19s]  One more.
[6020.19s -> 6023.94s]  All right, all right, all right, I've had enough.
[6023.94s -> 6027.65s]  What's in there?
[6027.65s -> 6033.91s]  Just a bunch of gross shit.
[6033.91s -> 6036.71s]  That corpse is rather suspicious.
[6036.71s -> 6037.91s]  It sure is.
[6037.91s -> 6050.41s]  I should probably kill it now.
[6050.41s -> 6053.05s]  Looks like there's something inside.
[6053.05s -> 6054.81s]  Am I going, digging around in here?
[6055.93s -> 6056.77s]  I don't wanna do that.
[6056.77s -> 6057.61s]  Oh.
[6062.14s -> 6063.78s]  Yeah, well.
[6063.78s -> 6066.58s]  I guess it turns out you just had gas.
[6066.58s -> 6068.76s]  Huh.
[6068.76s -> 6075.97s]  Ancient key.
[6075.97s -> 6079.37s]  Key for unlocking a clip.
[6079.37s -> 6080.21s]  Somebody's next to me.
[6080.21s -> 6083.94s]  Somebody's around here, and I go.
[6083.94s -> 6084.78s]  Oh shit.
[6091.17s -> 6092.97s]  Hands not in the air.
[6092.97s -> 6097.01s]  This video game just got fucked up.
[6097.01s -> 6101.94s]  It's a top 50 worst game.
[6101.94s -> 6117.50s]  Happened on stream.
[6117.54s -> 6120.62s]  I'm gonna have a huge red mark on my head right here.
[6120.62s -> 6121.70s]  All right, here we go.
[6121.70s -> 6122.54s]  Yeah.
[6122.54s -> 6129.29s]  That corpse is rather suspicious.
[6129.29s -> 6130.57s]  Get in there, dig in there, get the key.
[6130.57s -> 6132.26s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6132.26s -> 6134.42s]  Looks like there's something inside.
[6147.61s -> 6151.14s]  I'm gonna take my hand out.
[6151.14s -> 6152.06s]  Pick up the key.
[6169.28s -> 6171.38s]  I'm sure I can probably spot him.
[6171.38s -> 6172.98s]  I'm not leaving until I do.
[6180.43s -> 6182.03s]  Ooh, what is that?
[6182.03s -> 6183.35s]  A meat hammer.
[6183.35s -> 6184.19s]  Nice.
[6190.88s -> 6198.36s]  All right, easy.
[6199.76s -> 6206.22s]  I don't want that vase.
[6206.22s -> 6207.66s]  I don't need it.
[6207.66s -> 6212.46s]  I got an ancient key to the ancient door.
[6212.46s -> 6213.30s]  No good.
[6213.30s -> 6214.94s]  Won't budge.
[6214.94s -> 6222.65s]  What is it, the valve?
[6224.17s -> 6228.26s]  Ancient door for the ancient key.
[6228.26s -> 6230.58s]  There it is.
[6230.58s -> 6231.42s]  Okay.
[6232.30s -> 6242.34s]  He's not actually gonna beat this whole game, is he?
[6242.34s -> 6244.46s]  No, I don't think he will.
[6244.46s -> 6245.58s]  I mean, sometimes he does that,
[6245.58s -> 6247.78s]  but I mean, this is just, I don't think even him,
[6247.78s -> 6249.78s]  I don't think he would even wanna do this.
[6251.39s -> 6252.63s]  It is connect carbonite, though,
[6252.63s -> 6254.87s]  so I don't be surprised if he does.
[6254.87s -> 6256.07s]  Yeah, I guess it's true.
[6286.98s -> 6288.10s]  I can't get up.
[6288.10s -> 6290.98s]  I gotta throw my back up going down that fast.
[6290.98s -> 6296.33s]  Ah, ah, oh, I can't.
[6296.33s -> 6299.41s]  I gotta go.
[6299.41s -> 6301.37s]  I don't have to start on the way back, do I?
[6301.37s -> 6304.81s]  Oh, give me a fucking break.
[6304.81s -> 6305.73s]  Oh, give me a fucking break.
[6305.73s -> 6306.57s]  I don't wanna do this again.
[6306.57s -> 6307.41s]  I'm about to turn it off.
[6307.41s -> 6308.33s]  I am about to.
[6308.33s -> 6309.17s]  I'm fighting it.
[6309.17s -> 6311.17s]  I'm fighting the urge to turn it off.
[6311.17s -> 6312.01s]  I'm fighting it.
[6313.01s -> 6315.37s]  That corpse is really suspicious.
[6316.69s -> 6317.93s]  Do it, do it, do it.
[6321.45s -> 6322.57s]  Oh, I want it so bad.
[6322.57s -> 6324.29s]  I button, like, hold on.
[6324.29s -> 6325.13s]  I want it so bad.
[6325.13s -> 6326.25s]  I want it.
[6326.25s -> 6327.37s]  I want it so bad.
[6327.37s -> 6329.25s]  Okay, no, I'm gonna do it.
[6329.25s -> 6330.09s]  I'm not gonna think about it.
[6330.09s -> 6333.46s]  I'm just gonna turn it off.
[6333.46s -> 6336.46s]  Last try, last attempt, this final attempt.
[6336.46s -> 6338.10s]  No matter what happens, if I lose again,
[6338.10s -> 6339.58s]  so I'm going on to the other one.
[6339.58s -> 6353.66s]  The other one's called punt.
[6353.66s -> 6356.26s]  Key, fight the people, walk down the hall,
[6356.26s -> 6357.74s]  open the door, here we go.
[6357.74s -> 6359.34s]  Turn, check it out.
[6359.34s -> 6360.58s]  Got my hands up already.
[6368.57s -> 6369.41s]  Go, let's go.
[6369.41s -> 6370.25s]  I'm done, I'm good.
[6370.25s -> 6371.09s]  I saw.
[6371.09s -> 6371.93s]  I want that, no I don't.
[6371.93s -> 6372.77s]  Just keep this, who cares?
[6372.77s -> 6374.09s]  Go, it's all the same item.
[6374.09s -> 6375.49s]  Every item is the same item.
[6389.26s -> 6391.18s]  Okay, here we go.
[6393.00s -> 6393.92s]  Same deal.
[6393.92s -> 6394.76s]  Get the fire poker.
[6394.76s -> 6395.60s]  I will take that.
[6395.60s -> 6398.40s]  That's an extra, like, zero percent damage.
[6398.40s -> 6399.64s]  Go, good, done.
[6399.64s -> 6401.85s]  Let's go.
[6401.85s -> 6402.69s]  Duck.
[6422.57s -> 6423.97s]  How long can I stay down?
[6423.97s -> 6428.38s]  Do I have to duck again?
[6428.38s -> 6430.02s]  Why am I going this way?
[6430.02s -> 6430.86s]  What are you doing?
[6430.86s -> 6431.70s]  What are you doing?
[6431.70s -> 6432.78s]  What are you doing?
[6432.78s -> 6448.54s]  Why is the auto thing going the other way?
[6448.54s -> 6449.62s]  All right, come on.
[6449.62s -> 6450.54s]  No more deaths.
[6451.72s -> 6452.96s]  I just have to kill the guy.
[6452.96s -> 6457.83s]  I just have to get rid of the guy
[6457.83s -> 6459.75s]  before the audience turns on me.
[6466.99s -> 6468.43s]  Did you go through the wall?
[6472.30s -> 6473.30s]  No, come on, come on.
[6473.30s -> 6475.10s]  I wanna finish this.
[6475.10s -> 6476.46s]  Don't do this.
[6477.14s -> 6478.94s]  It's just moving on its own now.
[6478.94s -> 6480.54s]  Okay, it's time to turn it off.
[6489.10s -> 6491.39s]  It's time to turn it off.
[6491.39s -> 6492.23s]  Well, it's not.
[6492.23s -> 6494.35s]  It's not time to turn it off yet.
[6494.35s -> 6495.19s]  All right, quick.
[6495.19s -> 6496.71s]  Go this way and touch the thing.
[6496.71s -> 6499.29s]  Did I already do this?
[6499.29s -> 6500.61s]  I don't even remember.
[6500.61s -> 6503.06s]  Did I turn the valve already?
[6503.06s -> 6505.31s]  Did I?
[6505.31s -> 6506.15s]  What do we got?
[6506.15s -> 6506.99s]  Yes.
[6506.99s -> 6507.81s]  Yes.
[6507.81s -> 6508.65s]  Did I turn it already?
[6508.65s -> 6509.75s]  Yes.
[6509.75s -> 6510.59s]  Need to run.
[6510.59s -> 6532.38s]  Okay, I did.
[6532.38s -> 6536.18s]  We're done with this.
[6536.18s -> 6539.74s]  Hey, hey, hey, you fucking idiot, got up.
[6539.74s -> 6541.18s]  What are you doing?
[6541.18s -> 6543.12s]  What?
[6543.12s -> 6556.17s]  I'm turning.
[6556.17s -> 6563.56s]  Don't ever buy this.
[6563.56s -> 6564.56s]  If you go like this,
[6564.56s -> 6566.16s]  yeah, you don't have your fucking hands up.
[6566.16s -> 6567.48s]  Yeah, sometimes it works,
[6567.48s -> 6568.92s]  but sometimes it just doesn't
[6568.92s -> 6570.16s]  if you don't stand there.
[6571.20s -> 6573.12s]  Go like this instead.
[6573.12s -> 6575.52s]  You're like, the other two guys will slash you.
[6576.72s -> 6579.68s]  Holy shit.
[6579.68s -> 6580.50s]  Shred it?
[6580.50s -> 6586.12s]  All right.
[6586.12s -> 6587.59s]  Fine.
[6587.59s -> 6591.23s]  Fine.
[6591.23s -> 6601.53s]  Give me this fucking thing.
[6601.53s -> 6602.37s]  Let's shred it.
[6608.13s -> 6617.21s]  Let's shred this fucking thing.
[6617.21s -> 6618.47s]  What do you say?
[6618.47s -> 6621.87s]  Let's go.
[6621.87s -> 6627.10s]  Piece of shit.
[6627.10s -> 6628.54s]  Hey, what's this one?
[6628.54s -> 6629.46s]  Oh, Kung Fu.
[6629.46s -> 6630.30s]  Remember that game?
[6630.30s -> 6631.18s]  That was a lot of fun too.
[6631.18s -> 6632.02s]  Let me get it in there.
[6632.02s -> 6633.02s]  Fucking dumb thing.
[6640.06s -> 6640.90s]  Fucking crap.
[6640.90s -> 6642.50s]  Oh yeah, remember the Power Rangers game?
[6642.50s -> 6649.19s]  That game sure was fun, wasn't it?
[6649.19s -> 6650.03s]  Fucking piece of crap.
[6650.03s -> 6651.07s]  All these games suck.
[6651.07s -> 6652.15s]  Fuck the Kinect.
[6652.15s -> 6653.85s]  What's this one?
[6653.85s -> 6654.81s]  Stuntman Ignite.
[6654.81s -> 6655.65s]  No, that was a good one.
[6655.65s -> 6658.30s]  That was a fun game.
[6658.30s -> 6659.14s]  It's this one.
[6659.14s -> 6660.38s]  Oh yeah, remember the Petsch game?
[6660.38s -> 6666.10s]  Fucking dumb ass game.
[6666.26s -> 6669.85s]  Oh, my tie.
[6669.85s -> 6671.82s]  It got my tie.
[6671.82s -> 6674.68s]  Just like in the fucking Gremlins movie.
[6674.68s -> 6675.52s]  Oh shit.
[6692.24s -> 6695.02s]  Now we're gonna play Haunt.
[6695.02s -> 6698.85s]  Should be fun.
[6698.85s -> 6703.59s]  At least I hope it is.
[6703.59s -> 6709.09s]  And somebody just gave a fucking hundred bucks.
[6709.09s -> 6710.09s]  Oh no, no, no, Xbox.
[6710.09s -> 6711.81s]  No, Xbox, stop.
[6711.81s -> 6714.14s]  Xbox, stop it.
[6714.14s -> 6716.63s]  Cancel, cancel.
[6716.63s -> 6722.26s]  Okay.
[6722.26s -> 6728.69s]  It was AB Joe just gave a hundred bucks.
[6728.73s -> 6731.26s]  Thank you so much, AB Joe.
[6731.26s -> 6736.21s]  They say, hey, Yerma, good to see you up and about again.
[6736.21s -> 6738.29s]  I got your night sky t-shirt a while back
[6738.29s -> 6741.85s]  and I've had six strangers compliment the shirt so far.
[6741.85s -> 6743.84s]  Feels good, man.
[6743.84s -> 6746.12s]  You've always been there to help us all through the hard times.
[6746.12s -> 6748.68s]  Know that if you ever run into some rough times of your own,
[6748.68s -> 6749.88s]  know that we're all here for you.
[6749.88s -> 6750.72s]  Love you, man.
[6750.72s -> 6752.70s]  Keep up the good work.
[6752.70s -> 6753.54s]  Thanks a lot.
[6753.54s -> 6755.77s]  Thank you.
[6758.39s -> 6760.43s]  Sometimes I feel pretty down too.
[6762.18s -> 6764.02s]  I'm just like anybody else, right?
[6764.06s -> 6766.50s]  You got good days, you got bad days.
[6766.50s -> 6767.78s]  But I really appreciate that.
[6767.78s -> 6770.59s]  Thank you.
[6770.59s -> 6775.57s]  I'm not gonna shred the Kinect.
[6775.57s -> 6778.02s]  But seriously though, thank you so much.
[6778.02s -> 6781.46s]  We also had five community subs from Local Boomer.
[6781.46s -> 6783.88s]  Thank you, Local Boomer.
[6783.88s -> 6787.96s]  And then Phylactery gave 50 more fucking dollars.
[6787.96s -> 6790.12s]  Use this to buy some new legs.
[6790.12s -> 6792.32s]  Also, there's a machete and a tape down
[6792.32s -> 6797.46s]  in that tomb you left.
[6797.46s -> 6799.20s]  Okay.
[6799.20s -> 6801.82s]  Thank you.
[6801.82s -> 6804.26s]  All right, so this is called Haunt.
[6804.30s -> 6809.32s]  I'm gonna change the name of the game.
[6809.32s -> 6818.50s]  Is this even, I don't think this is even on Twitch.
[6818.50s -> 6821.02s]  I guess it is.
[6821.02s -> 6822.10s]  All right.
[6822.10s -> 6825.45s]  Let's go.
[6825.45s -> 6826.29s]  I'm ready.
[6826.29s -> 6827.13s]  Wait.
[6827.13s -> 6827.97s]  I'm not ready.
[6834.93s -> 6843.88s]  Haunt.
[6843.88s -> 6845.56s]  I think this one's a little more lighthearted
[6845.56s -> 6846.40s]  than the other one.
[6846.40s -> 6847.24s]  Is that right?
[6849.48s -> 6850.32s]  I don't know.
[6850.32s -> 6855.74s]  I think this one's supposed to be a better game.
[6855.74s -> 6857.18s]  Start game leaderboards helping off
[6857.18s -> 6859.71s]  with downloadable content.
[6859.71s -> 6864.87s]  Let's just go.
[6864.87s -> 6869.26s]  New game.
[6869.26s -> 6870.90s]  To ensure that Haunt functions correctly,
[6870.90s -> 6873.14s]  please ensure that the Xbox 360 Kinect sensor
[6873.14s -> 6875.30s]  and microphone are calibrated.
[6875.30s -> 6876.14s]  Would you like to?
[6876.14s -> 6878.34s]  No, I've already done this one.
[6878.34s -> 6880.66s]  I did this like fucking all day.
[6884.26s -> 6886.02s]  You can use either hand to control your flashlight.
[6886.02s -> 6888.42s]  If one arm gets tired, just change to the other.
[6888.42s -> 6893.46s]  So I get a flashlight in one hand.
[6893.46s -> 6894.30s]  Shred it.
[6894.30s -> 6895.14s]  I can't shred this one.
[6895.14s -> 6896.70s]  It's digital download only.
[6896.70s -> 6898.18s]  So it cannot be shredded.
[6899.70s -> 6907.27s]  As much as I would fucking love to.
[6907.27s -> 6908.27s]  I like a German.
[6908.27s -> 6911.31s]  Well, that was a copy pasta that I haven't seen in a while.
[6911.31s -> 6912.31s]  All right, let's go.
[6913.58s -> 6918.02s]  Avatar Award unlocked.
[6918.02s -> 6920.78s]  Hey, hey, hello down there.
[6920.78s -> 6923.10s]  Buddy, hey, hello.
[6923.10s -> 6923.94s]  Gamer picture?
[6923.94s -> 6924.98s]  Are you all right?
[6924.98s -> 6925.82s]  Can you hear me?
[6926.70s -> 6927.86s]  You're not dead, are you?
[6927.86s -> 6929.50s]  Pick up that flashlight if you're not dead.
[6929.50s -> 6934.26s]  Just reach out your arm and grab it.
[6934.26s -> 6939.33s]  What's a pick up flashlight?
[6939.33s -> 6943.14s]  I guess I got it.
[6943.14s -> 6944.10s]  Oh, wow.
[6944.10s -> 6945.06s]  You're not dead.
[6945.06s -> 6946.34s]  That's a nice surprise.
[6946.34s -> 6949.06s]  And now you can see where you're going, which is good.
[6951.22s -> 6952.06s]  To aim the flashlight,
[6952.06s -> 6957.15s]  move your arm just like you're holding a real flashlight.
[6957.15s -> 6959.39s]  Hey, can you test something for me?
[6959.39s -> 6961.15s]  There are some suits of armor around you.
[6961.15s -> 6962.15s]  Try turning towards them
[6962.15s -> 6963.39s]  and shining your flashlight at them.
[6963.39s -> 6965.63s]  Turn to left or right, look up and look down.
[6971.49s -> 6973.89s]  Okay, stop shining your light on that dirty thing.
[6973.89s -> 6975.37s]  Turn around and light up the suit of armor
[6975.37s -> 6979.50s]  on the other side of the corridor, will you?
[6979.50s -> 6980.42s]  Test failed.
[6980.42s -> 6982.62s]  Luckily, I was testing my maid, not you.
[6982.62s -> 6984.66s]  She's fired and you've passed.
[6984.66s -> 6991.87s]  Now, look at the painting at the end of the corridor.
[6991.91s -> 6993.83s]  Hey, who's that handsome fellow?
[6993.83s -> 6995.83s]  Why, it's me, Benjamin.
[6995.83s -> 6996.67s]  Surprise!
[6996.67s -> 6998.31s]  I mean, if you think Harry Potter is scary,
[6998.31s -> 7001.03s]  this could probably be in that same universe.
[7001.03s -> 7003.51s]  As you can see, I am stuck in this painting,
[7003.51s -> 7006.59s]  but the good news is I can possess any portrait in the house,
[7006.59s -> 7009.36s]  so I've got that going for me.
[7009.36s -> 7012.40s]  Still, I wish I could walk around freely like you can.
[7012.40s -> 7014.68s]  Hey, wait, you can still walk around, right?
[7014.68s -> 7016.12s]  He's doing monkey hats.
[7016.12s -> 7022.88s]  Turn around to the right, will you?
[7022.88s -> 7023.72s]  What is it?
[7023.72s -> 7024.64s]  To move in the direction you're facing,
[7024.64s -> 7026.12s]  simply walk on the spot.
[7038.69s -> 7039.53s]  That's so much more intuitive.
[7039.53s -> 7041.33s]  When you get to a corridor junction like this,
[7041.33s -> 7043.37s]  you need to choose which way to go.
[7044.33s -> 7047.61s]  But you still look a little groggy, so I'll choose for you.
[7047.61s -> 7050.21s]  Take the corridor on your left and then head upstairs.
[7050.21s -> 7051.05s]  Left.
[7052.46s -> 7054.98s]  When you're approaching corridor junction,
[7054.98s -> 7056.22s]  arrows like this will appear
[7056.22s -> 7058.06s]  to show you the available directions.
[7058.06s -> 7059.66s]  To choose which way to go
[7059.66s -> 7062.98s]  and your flashlight in the direction you want to take,
[7062.98s -> 7065.18s]  the arrows will change to show the selected direction.
[7065.18s -> 7067.06s]  Then just keep walking.
[7067.10s -> 7069.62s]  There's no need to stop while you decide.
[7069.62s -> 7071.02s]  If you'd rather move around freely,
[7071.02s -> 7072.62s]  you can turn assisted movement off
[7072.62s -> 7074.26s]  at any time in the settings page.
[7074.26s -> 7075.30s]  I ain't gonna do that.
[7076.78s -> 7077.62s]  Absolutely not.
[7079.37s -> 7102.94s]  We're gonna stay on aim assist.
[7102.94s -> 7106.19s]  All right?
[7106.19s -> 7107.39s]  You made it.
[7107.39s -> 7109.64s]  Welcome to my grand hall.
[7109.64s -> 7110.80s]  It's pretty grand, right?
[7110.80s -> 7113.88s]  I mean, under all the dust and stuff.
[7114.76s -> 7115.60s]  Let me take you.
[7115.60s -> 7117.04s]  What the fuck are you guys saying?
[7117.04s -> 7118.80s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7118.80s -> 7119.64s]  Okay.
[7119.64s -> 7120.80s]  I want a little tour.
[7120.80s -> 7122.08s]  I'll move to another painting
[7122.08s -> 7123.80s]  and you try to find me, okay?
[7123.80s -> 7129.52s]  Ooh, this is going to be fun.
[7129.52s -> 7132.12s]  Try to find the painting that Benjamin moved to.
[7140.33s -> 7142.19s]  This is kids' game?
[7142.19s -> 7143.11s]  I didn't look that up.
[7143.11s -> 7144.87s]  No, this is supposed to be good.
[7154.18s -> 7159.22s]  What painting?
[7159.22s -> 7160.26s]  I got you right here.
[7161.34s -> 7162.18s]  Great.
[7162.18s -> 7164.74s]  And now that I have selflessly gotten you back on your feet,
[7164.74s -> 7166.70s]  I ask nothing in return.
[7166.70s -> 7169.34s]  Save for one teensy-weensy favor.
[7169.34s -> 7170.58s]  Sounds fair, right?
[7170.58s -> 7171.58s]  Of course it does.
[7172.62s -> 7174.50s]  I'd do it myself if it weren't for this whole
[7174.50s -> 7175.90s]  stuck in a painting thing.
[7175.90s -> 7176.74s]  Said what?
[7176.74s -> 7178.10s]  Why don't you just take your not stuck in a painting
[7178.10s -> 7180.10s]  back through this door and we'll get going.
[7181.54s -> 7183.70s]  But I can't interact with the chat room.
[7199.60s -> 7200.44s]  All right.
[7200.44s -> 7201.28s]  Am I on my own yet?
[7203.72s -> 7204.68s]  That was a little scary.
[7204.68s -> 7207.12s]  I'm gonna go left or right.
[7207.12s -> 7207.96s]  I'll say left.
[7211.13s -> 7214.30s]  Now, you'll need to rummage through various objects
[7214.30s -> 7216.21s]  around the mansion.
[7216.21s -> 7217.53s]  See that chest on your left?
[7217.53s -> 7219.57s]  Pop it open and let's see what's in it.
[7220.09s -> 7221.21s]  I made the right call.
[7226.18s -> 7227.26s]  Okay.
[7227.26s -> 7236.85s]  Open it.
[7236.85s -> 7239.06s]  There's nothing in there.
[7239.06s -> 7239.90s]  Aha!
[7239.90s -> 7240.74s]  Look at that!
[7240.74s -> 7241.58s]  Vitality!
[7241.58s -> 7243.74s]  Sweet, delicious vitality.
[7243.74s -> 7246.14s]  There's vitality in there?
[7246.14s -> 7248.26s]  I bet you've never seen that before, have you?
[7248.26s -> 7251.23s]  I've got a bunch of it hidden around the place.
[7251.23s -> 7253.07s]  And you're gonna need it.
[7253.07s -> 7255.47s]  Not that this job is dangerous or anything, but-
[7255.47s -> 7256.31s]  Put my hand down.
[7256.31s -> 7258.15s]  If you do lose all your vitality, then well,
[7258.15s -> 7260.39s]  let's just say I can't be held responsible.
[7260.39s -> 7261.31s]  Let's keep moving.
[7262.31s -> 7266.28s]  Benjamin will often have useful interesting viz- viz-
[7266.28s -> 7267.12s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7267.12s -> 7269.32s]  If you're stuck or, no, I am not, I'm not,
[7269.32s -> 7270.16s]  I'm not a kid.
[7271.12s -> 7271.96s]  I'm ready.
[7274.31s -> 7283.66s]  Let's go.
[7283.66s -> 7284.50s]  Gosh.
[7284.50s -> 7298.06s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[7298.06s -> 7300.30s]  All right, this is where it gets scary, guys.
[7300.30s -> 7303.74s]  Turn the lights down on your house.
[7303.74s -> 7315.03s]  I don't want to listen to Benjamin.
[7315.03s -> 7316.05s]  Fine.
[7316.05s -> 7317.64s]  What do you have to say?
[7317.64s -> 7320.28s]  This next room has something really great in it.
[7320.28s -> 7322.04s]  Oh, was it something really dangerous?
[7322.04s -> 7323.20s]  I can't remember.
[7323.28s -> 7324.52s]  Either way, open the door,
[7324.52s -> 7328.66s]  because I'm dying to find out.
[7328.66s -> 7330.26s]  Doors work like any other objects.
[7330.26s -> 7331.54s]  Just hold the light on it and-
[7331.54s -> 7332.38s]  No!
[7342.74s -> 7343.58s]  Vitality.
[7347.46s -> 7361.41s]  What was that?
[7361.41s -> 7362.25s]  All right.
[7362.25s -> 7364.01s]  I'm gonna get full of vitality here.
[7365.93s -> 7368.57s]  Man, I am seeing some monkey-essence right now,
[7368.57s -> 7369.81s]  and I agree with you.
[7371.22s -> 7372.58s]  I completely agree.
[7374.82s -> 7380.42s]  Oh!
[7380.42s -> 7392.12s]  Oh!
[7392.12s -> 7393.52s]  Don't be something in here.
[7393.52s -> 7394.92s]  Don't be something in here.
[7396.57s -> 7397.77s]  Oh!
[7397.77s -> 7398.93s]  No, it's vitality.
[7398.93s -> 7408.06s]  Good.
[7408.06s -> 7410.41s]  Was it a slug?
[7410.41s -> 7412.41s]  Extra vitality vial found.
[7414.23s -> 7417.30s]  What does that do?
[7417.30s -> 7418.74s]  Vitality vial.
[7418.74s -> 7423.37s]  Hey, you guys, you guys should come here and comment.
[7423.37s -> 7424.21s]  Sorry.
[7424.21s -> 7425.05s]  I'm sorry.
[7425.05s -> 7429.46s]  I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
[7429.46s -> 7430.46s]  You right back up again.
[7430.46s -> 7433.02s]  Good as new.
[7433.02s -> 7435.30s]  Let's get out of here before more ghosts show up.
[7435.30s -> 7440.34s]  Go through the door to the left of the painting.
[7440.34s -> 7442.42s]  All right, go to the door in the left of the painting.
[7442.42s -> 7445.90s]  It's time to start playing The Haunted House.
[7460.22s -> 7462.74s]  Brats, now where did I put that key?
[7468.19s -> 7469.51s]  Oh, there it is.
[7469.51s -> 7471.07s]  Collect the key and unlock the door.
[7471.07s -> 7472.63s]  What a specific item you needed to proceed.
[7472.63s -> 7475.15s]  An icon showing what's required will appear on the screen.
[7475.15s -> 7476.59s]  You need a key.
[7476.59s -> 7478.23s]  There it is.
[7478.23s -> 7479.43s]  Sure, I'll get it.
[7479.43s -> 7480.27s]  There it is.
[7480.27s -> 7481.11s]  Focus.
[7487.26s -> 7488.26s]  Door key got.
[7507.29s -> 7508.99s]  Okay.
[7508.99s -> 7522.66s]  This is where it begins.
[7522.66s -> 7542.15s]  Uh-oh.
[7542.19s -> 7543.83s]  That could be me in some way.
[7543.83s -> 7545.43s]  That's me.
[7545.43s -> 7548.23s]  That's just, I feel like I look like that like every day.
[7550.74s -> 7553.10s]  Ho-ho, we are getting close, my friend.
[7553.10s -> 7554.90s]  I've got a feeling that this next room
[7554.90s -> 7556.98s]  has something very exciting in it.
[7556.98s -> 7558.74s]  Something I want very much.
[7558.74s -> 7560.74s]  I mean, something that we want.
[7576.89s -> 7578.09s]  The drawing room.
[7578.09s -> 7578.93s]  Uh-oh.
[7581.69s -> 7582.53s]  I have the boat.
[7582.53s -> 7585.33s]  Ghost, these guys are as mean as they are stupid.
[7585.33s -> 7586.17s]  This is what we just made.
[7586.45s -> 7588.49s]  This is Luigi's mansion.
[7590.85s -> 7591.69s]  Good.
[7591.69s -> 7593.15s]  Now's your chance.
[7593.15s -> 7594.94s]  Hit him with a counter-attack.
[7594.94s -> 7595.78s]  Now what?
[7595.78s -> 7596.62s]  I'm gonna punch him?
[7598.62s -> 7601.35s]  I'm gonna punch the ghost.
[7601.35s -> 7602.19s]  Yes, you got him in a daze.
[7602.19s -> 7603.83s]  Now hold your flashlight on him.
[7603.83s -> 7605.15s]  Brutes hate that.
[7605.15s -> 7606.27s]  Keep it steady.
[7608.27s -> 7610.17s]  This is like a horror game.
[7610.17s -> 7622.42s]  We only played one horror,
[7622.42s -> 7624.90s]  it's only one horror game for the Kinect.
[7624.90s -> 7625.74s]  And we played it.
[7625.78s -> 7626.90s]  He's dazed again.
[7626.90s -> 7629.38s]  Now hold your flashlight on him to finish him off.
[7640.98s -> 7643.30s]  Be done.
[7643.30s -> 7644.14s]  Good.
[7644.14s -> 7645.58s]  All right, I got him.
[7645.58s -> 7649.97s]  That was so simple.
[7649.97s -> 7654.96s]  Open the chest, get the reward.
[7654.96s -> 7658.17s]  And that's, I'm kind of regretting
[7658.17s -> 7661.65s]  turning off the other game.
[7661.65s -> 7663.25s]  Not yet, though.
[7663.25s -> 7664.09s]  Bingo!
[7664.09s -> 7666.34s]  Honest to goodness, Fanta Blast.
[7666.34s -> 7668.94s]  I've been looking for one of these forever.
[7668.94s -> 7677.67s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[7677.67s -> 7680.07s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[7681.46s -> 7683.78s]  Quick, let's get it back to the grand hall.
[7683.78s -> 7686.42s]  The fastest way, the longer corridor and up the stairs.
[7686.42s -> 7687.26s]  Let's get a move on.
[7687.26s -> 7688.94s]  Hut, hut, lift those knees.
[7698.09s -> 7700.89s]  Oh, let's get in here and see if the game's any good.
[7706.49s -> 7712.21s]  It is fairly intuitive.
[7712.21s -> 7729.04s]  Okay, all right, here comes the scary part.
[7729.04s -> 7743.03s]  Whoa, what happened there?
[7743.03s -> 7743.95s]  Almost there.
[7743.95s -> 7745.43s]  Through that door into the grand hall
[7745.43s -> 7746.27s]  and then head down to that door.
[7746.27s -> 7747.11s]  That was very scary.
[7747.11s -> 7748.55s]  This is going to be incredible.
[7759.66s -> 7763.58s]  Quick, go back, go back to Rise of Nightmares.
[7766.19s -> 7773.40s]  Quick!
[7773.40s -> 7784.76s]  Not yet.
[7784.76s -> 7788.33s]  What are these doors?
[7788.33s -> 7790.79s]  Vaults?
[7790.79s -> 7791.63s]  I can't read that.
[7791.63s -> 7799.24s]  I can't, I actually cannot read it.
[7799.24s -> 7801.93s]  Oh, have you guys been good, by the way?
[7801.93s -> 7803.89s]  Have you been good?
[7803.89s -> 7811.52s]  How good have you been?
[7811.52s -> 7812.34s]  Played in the dark?
[7812.34s -> 7815.08s]  Well, it's currently almost 6 p.m. here.
[7815.08s -> 7817.56s]  The sun's not down.
[7817.56s -> 7820.89s]  Have you been good?
[7820.89s -> 7825.09s]  I think you've been good.
[7825.09s -> 7827.30s]  This game sucks.
[7827.30s -> 7828.42s]  Don't say that yet.
[7828.42s -> 7830.73s]  We have to get out of the tutorial.
[7830.73s -> 7833.47s]  Hold on though.
[7833.47s -> 7843.88s]  If you've been good, I've got something to show you.
[7843.88s -> 7849.66s]  So what I'm about to show you guys
[7849.66s -> 7855.04s]  is something really exciting.
[7855.04s -> 7861.30s]  This is a sneak peek at one of the robots for the carnival
[7861.30s -> 7864.79s]  coming up in a few weeks.
[7864.79s -> 7870.26s]  So if you do not want to be spoiled,
[7870.26s -> 7873.38s]  close your eyes and block your ears.
[7873.38s -> 7878.14s]  Or just put me in a fucking tab or something.
[7878.14s -> 7885.29s]  So this is the official, official reveal
[7885.45s -> 7887.42s]  of one of the robots.
[7887.42s -> 7893.92s]  So why don't we take a look?
[7893.92s -> 7901.14s]  Pretty interesting stuff.
[7901.14s -> 7902.18s]  World premiere.
[7902.18s -> 7908.66s]  This is the robot that will be used for the dunk tank.
[7908.66s -> 7914.48s]  And if you think that looks cool, just wait.
[7914.48s -> 7915.72s]  Let's take a look at the side view.
[7915.72s -> 7926.70s]  We've got a good side view.
[7926.70s -> 7929.28s]  There will be more than one robot.
[7929.28s -> 7931.42s]  There will be more than two.
[7931.42s -> 7933.50s]  There will be more.
[7933.50s -> 7937.24s]  This ain't the only one.
[7937.24s -> 7938.72s]  Oh, and if you want to see a full,
[7938.72s -> 7945.38s]  kind of wide of how it all works, take a look at this.
[7945.38s -> 7951.64s]  This shit is the real fucking deal, guys.
[7951.64s -> 7957.12s]  And yes, the company is Andy Mark.
[7957.12s -> 7961.82s]  Awesome group of people.
[7961.82s -> 7968.12s]  Some of you probably already know who this company is.
[7968.12s -> 7981.78s]  Why don't we see how it works?
[7981.78s -> 7987.78s]  You will be in total control of this machine
[7987.78s -> 8000.54s]  in just about three weeks.
[8000.54s -> 8003.50s]  Up, down, left, right.
[8003.50s -> 8007.14s]  Oh yeah.
[8007.14s -> 8008.20s]  When is this stream?
[8008.20s -> 8017.19s]  It'll be the 21st of September.
[8017.19s -> 8020.50s]  And that ain't nothing.
[8020.50s -> 8024.30s]  You ain't seen anything yet.
[8024.30s -> 8029.66s]  But huge, huge, huge, huge, huge props to Andy Mark
[8031.90s -> 8036.42s]  because they're just as excited as I am
[8036.42s -> 8040.70s]  as probably a lot of you are now.
[8040.70s -> 8045.95s]  We'll talk way more about them at a later date.
[8045.95s -> 8054.56s]  But I just wanted to tease that.
[8054.56s -> 8065.98s]  Hey, let's not go back to being home like this.
[8065.98s -> 8067.89s]  It's gonna be fun.
[8067.89s -> 8072.07s]  September 21st, is that correct?
[8072.07s -> 8073.48s]  No, like this?
[8073.48s -> 8077.28s]  Cause it's mirrored.
[8077.28s -> 8081.22s]  No, now this game is like lame in comparison.
[8081.22s -> 8082.67s]  I want to do that well.
[8082.67s -> 8087.50s]  We're at like peak time.
[8087.50s -> 8088.82s]  But I'm so fucking excited.
[8088.82s -> 8090.90s]  You have no idea.
[8090.90s -> 8092.34s]  It's been a few months
[8092.34s -> 8094.96s]  of trying to get this all put together.
[8094.96s -> 8098.35s]  Lots of people involved.
[8098.35s -> 8100.99s]  It's gonna be fucking awesome.
[8100.99s -> 8103.73s]  Save the date.
[8103.73s -> 8114.02s]  All right, let's play the kids' game.
[8114.02s -> 8117.70s]  What's it doing?
[8117.70s -> 8120.57s]  Oh, I gotta find the ectoplasm, right?
[8120.57s -> 8124.09s]  Hurry, get the final phytoflask back to where it belongs.
[8124.09s -> 8127.90s]  Take it to the statue before...
[8127.90s -> 8133.26s]  These guys, anyone but these guys.
[8133.26s -> 8134.62s]  I'll stature you little creeps.
[8134.62s -> 8137.50s]  It's Beatback Sonic, except he's orange.
[8137.54s -> 8139.38s]  It's Garfield, Beanbag Sonic.
[8139.38s -> 8147.37s]  This slimy ghost fingers off my phytoflask.
[8147.37s -> 8148.21s]  Good day.
[8148.21s -> 8150.29s]  I'm so, so close.
[8150.29s -> 8152.41s]  Years of work wasted.
[8152.41s -> 8155.18s]  Now I'm back to square one.
[8155.18s -> 8158.26s]  Still, they haven't beaten me yet.
[8158.26s -> 8160.62s]  I have one of the four phytoflasks.
[8160.62s -> 8161.94s]  But of course, I still have one, right?
[8161.94s -> 8162.78s]  It really isn't.
[8162.78s -> 8163.98s]  It is just Luigi's mansion.
[8163.98s -> 8165.38s]  Now, first things first.
[8165.38s -> 8167.06s]  Let's get that phytoflask back to the statue.
[8167.06s -> 8167.90s]  It's all right.
[8167.90s -> 8168.72s]  It's fun.
[8168.72s -> 8171.08s]  It is.
[8171.08s -> 8172.26s]  Don't make me put in another one.
[8172.26s -> 8174.90s]  I'll put in Guy Fieri's minute to win it
[8174.90s -> 8176.50s]  if you don't fucking calm down.
[8183.86s -> 8185.69s]  See that coming?
[8185.69s -> 8201.91s]  To protect my last phytoflask.
[8201.91s -> 8224.43s]  I've got him.
[8224.43s -> 8225.91s]  Nice work.
[8225.91s -> 8226.75s]  Where's Dr. Regat?
[8226.75s -> 8228.03s]  You should talk that ghost a thing or two.
[8228.03s -> 8228.87s]  Oh, there he is.
[8228.87s -> 8229.71s]  Now let's get that phytoflask.
[8229.71s -> 8230.55s]  Get that phytoflask.
[8230.55s -> 8231.39s]  Get that phytoflask.
[8231.39s -> 8232.23s]  Get that phytoflask.
[8232.23s -> 8233.07s]  Get that phytoflask.
[8233.07s -> 8234.60s]  Get that phytoflask.
[8234.60s -> 8235.44s]  Yeah, thanks.
[8235.44s -> 8244.04s]  I appreciate the encouragement.
[8244.04s -> 8248.22s]  To the statue where it belongs.
[8248.22s -> 8249.06s]  I have to move.
[8249.06s -> 8262.38s]  I can't, I'm like turning to stone.
[8262.38s -> 8264.58s]  I just slammed that phytoflask down into the slot
[8264.58s -> 8272.32s]  and we're good to go.
[8272.36s -> 8276.14s]  Do I have to get three more of these to win?
[8276.14s -> 8276.98s]  Should I do it?
[8282.58s -> 8284.94s]  Well, we've got one phytoflask safe.
[8284.94s -> 8286.30s]  Now if we could just get the other three,
[8286.30s -> 8288.72s]  we've still got a chance.
[8288.72s -> 8291.12s]  Luckily, those stupid ghosts can't leave the boundaries
[8291.12s -> 8292.92s]  of my glaring designed mansion.
[8292.92s -> 8294.86s]  So tracking them down should be easy.
[8294.86s -> 8296.16s]  If we work together.
[8297.16s -> 8299.40s]  I think they went through those doors up on the balcony.
[8299.40s -> 8302.24s]  They all lead to different parts of my mansion.
[8302.24s -> 8303.24s]  We'll need to search them all,
[8303.24s -> 8305.68s]  but I'll let you pick which one we go through first.
[8305.68s -> 8308.12s]  Collaboration is the key to any successful partnership.
[8309.08s -> 8314.23s]  Now, get up those stairs and choose a door.
[8314.23s -> 8315.31s]  All right, this is where I get to choose a door.
[8315.31s -> 8317.43s]  This is where I'm gonna, this is important.
[8319.37s -> 8334.02s]  Check this shit out.
[8334.02s -> 8338.32s]  There is some exhilarating fucking gameplay.
[8338.32s -> 8342.11s]  All right, one, two, or three.
[8342.11s -> 8343.31s]  This one's got the solar system on it.
[8343.31s -> 8345.31s]  That's what I'm going to.
[8345.31s -> 8346.83s]  If I'm not wowed in 10 seconds,
[8346.83s -> 8355.38s]  I'm gonna put in Guy Fiori.
[8355.38s -> 8356.70s]  I talked a lot of shit.
[8356.70s -> 8399.97s]  Oh, they lit up the hallway.
[8399.97s -> 8408.89s]  It's, behold, my beautiful lubinarium.
[8408.89s -> 8412.09s]  Well, at least try to imagine my beautiful lubinarium
[8412.09s -> 8413.61s]  and what it would look like if.
[8419.78s -> 8422.50s]  Okay, usually it's chat that gets bored
[8422.50s -> 8425.90s]  and they're like doing Jupiters and talking to each other,
[8425.90s -> 8427.06s]  but I'm bored right now.
[8427.06s -> 8428.58s]  Like that's pretty rare.
[8428.58s -> 8430.50s]  That's pretty rare for the streamer to be bored.
[8430.50s -> 8432.41s]  It is.
[8432.41s -> 8434.77s]  I don't typically get bored of a game.
[8434.77s -> 8436.45s]  Like I'm bored.
[8436.45s -> 8437.29s]  I am.
[8437.29s -> 8439.77s]  All right, we're gonna go, we're gonna go straight.
[8448.09s -> 8449.83s]  All right, what's down this hall?
[8449.83s -> 8455.26s]  Anything in particular?
[8455.26s -> 8459.36s]  How about in here?
[8459.36s -> 8460.20s]  Open.
[8463.24s -> 8466.29s]  Okay.
[8466.29s -> 8467.13s]  Oh no.
[8468.46s -> 8473.07s]  Not another one of these.
[8473.07s -> 8473.91s]  Punch.
[8493.74s -> 8494.82s]  Why does it go twice?
[8499.14s -> 8501.10s]  If you had a son or a daughter,
[8501.10s -> 8506.48s]  that this would be fun, right?
[8506.48s -> 8516.36s]  What was that?
[8516.36s -> 8517.64s]  What's in there?
[8517.64s -> 8518.92s]  Something scary.
[8518.92s -> 8521.00s]  I hope it's not something scary.
[8521.00s -> 8521.88s]  I need slides.
[8521.88s -> 8522.96s]  All right, all right.
[8547.32s -> 8548.16s]  What's that?
[8548.16s -> 8550.26s]  The telephone?
[8550.26s -> 8551.30s]  Let's split the switch.
[8558.20s -> 8561.57s]  Nothing.
[8561.57s -> 8568.45s]  I'm gonna go in that door to the left.
[8568.45s -> 8571.45s]  Open it.
[8571.45s -> 8574.08s]  I can't open this fucking door.
[8574.08s -> 8577.71s]  Why not?
[8577.71s -> 8583.70s]  Where are these slides?
[8583.70s -> 8601.84s]  Okay.
[8601.84s -> 8608.29s]  What was that?
[8608.29s -> 8609.33s]  All right, we're gonna go right
[8609.33s -> 8610.93s]  because that's where I haven't been.
[8610.93s -> 8611.77s]  No, no, no.
[8611.77s -> 8613.73s]  Dumb game is dumb.
[8613.73s -> 8614.89s]  Dumb game.
[8614.89s -> 8615.93s]  Turn.
[8615.93s -> 8622.00s]  I wanna go this way.
[8622.00s -> 8624.56s]  That was pretty intense.
[8624.56s -> 8630.70s]  I'm gonna go right.
[8630.70s -> 8635.93s]  What was that?
[8635.93s -> 8636.77s]  Try this door.
[8641.59s -> 8643.74s]  Okay, easy.
[8643.74s -> 8646.75s]  This is the lunch room.
[8646.75s -> 8652.12s]  Let's examine some stuff.
[8652.12s -> 8655.67s]  I got full health.
[8655.67s -> 8665.31s]  Check each one of these.
[8665.31s -> 8667.14s]  What about that?
[8667.14s -> 8674.84s]  What's that sound?
[8674.84s -> 8676.28s]  Projector slide found.
[8677.78s -> 8678.62s]  Oh!
[8689.06s -> 8690.26s]  It doesn't even come up on camera.
[8690.26s -> 8691.62s]  I don't come fucking at it.
[8698.36s -> 8700.67s]  Poured water all over my eyes.
[8700.67s -> 8701.99s]  Let's try, wait, just try that again.
[8701.99s -> 8711.00s]  Ready?
[8711.00s -> 8715.39s]  It's fucking terrifying.
[8715.39s -> 8717.31s]  I don't recommend playing this game
[8717.31s -> 8735.12s]  because it's really fucking scary.
[8735.12s -> 8737.84s]  Am I actually about to type in the Guy Fieri?
[8737.84s -> 8743.07s]  Then there's no way no one's ever played this.
[8743.07s -> 8750.12s]  No one has played Guy Fieri.
[8750.12s -> 8751.69s]  Guy?
[8751.69s -> 8752.53s]  How do you spell Guy?
[8752.53s -> 8761.62s]  Oh, it's right here.
[8761.62s -> 8763.71s]  I'm wearing a hat.
[8763.71s -> 8766.97s]  This is a baseball hat.
[8766.97s -> 8771.01s]  What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[8771.01s -> 8781.08s]  This is a baseball hat.
[8781.08s -> 8788.60s]  No, I gotta wear it like this.
[8788.60s -> 8792.88s]  Why is it warped?
[8792.88s -> 8796.23s]  All right, there is no Guy Fieri.
[8796.23s -> 8797.91s]  I'm gonna have to just make it games and demos.
[8797.91s -> 8803.23s]  Guy Fieri doesn't fucking exist.
[8804.07s -> 8804.91s]  I don't even know how to play Minute to Win It.
[8804.91s -> 8820.95s]  How do you play?
[8820.95s -> 8825.13s]  In a minute, you have to win it.
[8825.13s -> 8841.38s]  Right.
[8841.38s -> 8847.32s]  I guess that makes sense.
[8847.32s -> 8852.08s]  This is not even on right.
[8852.08s -> 8854.88s]  All right, Guy Fieri, let's see what you got.
[8854.88s -> 8877.95s]  This might be the scariest fucking game all night.
[8877.95s -> 8879.79s]  I hope he's on camera.
[8879.79s -> 8884.72s]  Please be on camera.
[8884.72s -> 8887.39s]  Is this him singing?
[8887.39s -> 8892.07s]  Could be.
[8892.07s -> 8894.63s]  No, no, no, I don't care.
[8895.89s -> 8896.97s]  Fuck your error code.
[8899.83s -> 8910.21s]  There it is.
[8910.21s -> 8911.41s]  Just me.
[8911.41s -> 8921.16s]  It's just me.
[8921.92s -> 8923.80s]  All right, I don't know how to play Minute to Win It.
[8923.80s -> 8925.40s]  I've never seen this show.
[8927.02s -> 8935.75s]  Show one.
[8935.75s -> 8937.31s]  No, I don't know how to play Minute to Win It.
[8937.31s -> 8942.23s]  Let me just try easy.
[8942.23s -> 8948.23s]  I wonder the lyrics to this song.
[8948.23s -> 8949.07s]  Hold on.
[8949.07s -> 8954.64s]  No, I wanna hear the lyrics.
[8954.64s -> 8956.54s]  Let's go.

[11338.91s -> 11340.91s]  All right, I haven't done this one yet
[11344.98s -> 11350.13s]  bucket head

[11396.14s -> 11407.22s]  one
[11420.88s -> 11422.88s]  What are you doing? I can't see shit
[11433.33s -> 11437.01s]  This is the most unintuitive piece of shit i'm shredding it right now
[11544.98s -> 11553.81s]  It actually what it's it's like wants to come out. I didn't even do anything. It wanted to do this
[11554.13s -> 11560.54s]  It was like i'm coming out. You saw clearly I was over here. The xbox is over here

[11640.67s -> 11645.81s]  All right, don't try this at home unless you have a shredder that's capable
[11648.08s -> 11651.76s]  Don't even do that. Anyways, this could take up to fucking five like 5 000 credit cards
[11662.72s -> 11666.40s]  Seriously, though, don't fucking don't try this at home. I'm a professional. This is a professional shredder
[11727.73s -> 11731.73s]  What do I get the biggest shredder to shred the little shredder that didn't shred the fucking thing that you're supposed to be able to shred
[11731.73s -> 11775.87s]  In the shredder you can shred credit cards. You can shred plastic you shred it. It's it's I want I want my money back on that one
[11775.87s -> 11776.99s]  I think
[11776.99s -> 11806.64s]  Fix it there. All right, so you want us to play it you want me to play that game?
[11806.96s -> 11825.38s]  There's nothing to clean. What are you talking about? What do you mean play that game? Oh, we'll play in a different one
[11825.86s -> 11832.51s]  We're gonna play a classic game
[11838.13s -> 11848.40s]  And I ain't shredding it. Don't try that at home. That's a real disclaimer that then don't you get hurt
[11848.40s -> 11852.24s]  Don't fucking do that. Not with the midlife professional shredders. Don't fuck around
[11852.96s -> 11883.33s]  Here we go. Did you unplug it? Yeah, it's fine. It's don't worry
[11884.69s -> 11886.69s]  It's unplugged. It's safe
[11886.69s -> 11893.01s]  safety only
[11893.01s -> 11903.84s]  Get a polenta

[11937.92s -> 11940.80s]  No, that's right rare did make like all the connect games. That's right
[11945.86s -> 11948.10s]  They put rare on like connect only
[11954.93s -> 11956.93s]  Pick the player. What are you talking about? Oh

[11988.61s -> 12002.05s]  How do I how do I get the game to go? Oh, I have to okay
[12011.82s -> 12021.97s]  main event soccer bowling
[12022.45s -> 12028.59s]  What's the best one?
[12028.59s -> 12031.23s]  Boxing. Okay, is the boxing good on this?
[12032.51s -> 12034.51s]  It's pretty damn fun
[12035.62s -> 12037.62s]  Uh against computer you can do a good setup
[12038.02s -> 12040.66s]  How would you do?
[12040.66s -> 12042.82s]  You face each other and like fight each other in a room
[12043.46s -> 12048.58s]  I feel like that'd be dangerous
[12048.58s -> 12052.72s]  Okay, let's go
[12052.72s -> 12057.90s]  Let's hear your supporters cheer
[12060.11s -> 12068.88s]  tornado gardens

[12087.87s -> 12094.19s]  That doesn't seem right. Let's give these people a good show. All right, wait, what?
[12094.75s -> 12098.34s]  We can expect something quite special from this pair
[12102.00s -> 12111.22s]  All right, I guess we're gonna go punch to strike your opponent right? I mean obviously punch high
[12113.89s -> 12115.57s]  Or punch low
[12115.57s -> 12130.21s]  Pull your shoulder back before you punch to add power and knock your opponent back
[12131.01s -> 12133.60s]  Pull your shoulder back
[12133.60s -> 12137.70s]  That
[12137.70s -> 12139.70s]  Okay, that's that's a power punch
[12140.18s -> 12142.80s]  And this is a block
[12142.88s -> 12147.57s]  You got it
[12147.65s -> 12149.25s]  Or block no
[12149.25s -> 12159.58s]  Wait, you go like this?
[12159.58s -> 12161.10s]  Okay, let's go
[12161.10s -> 12179.50s]  I'm sorry. I don't want to fight the old man, but I have to apparently
[12183.97s -> 12203.76s]  Oh, he got me
[12203.76s -> 12211.02s]  Oh, he's out
[12211.02s -> 12216.58s]  He's out
[12216.82s -> 12232.69s]  Do I know does it automatically move forward?
[12249.20s -> 12252.32s]  Oh, I knocked him up. He's been knocked out
[12269.36s -> 12271.36s]  I like to move it move it
[12273.60s -> 12275.50s]  How could I do that
[12275.50s -> 12277.50s]  It's all right. Wait, it's recording
[12287.68s -> 12290.37s]  He's crying
[12298.98s -> 12300.42s]  Continue
[12300.42s -> 12307.68s]  Do you go through other players that are better than you are?
[12309.49s -> 12311.49s]  You look tough. What a tough guy
[12312.05s -> 12314.67s]  Play boxing, right?
[12314.67s -> 12327.86s]  Let's get this show on the road
[12341.15s -> 12345.95s]  No, that okay, that's my okay. So let's so who do I fight now the same person
[12349.90s -> 12352.62s]  Kevin again, I don't want to beat up kevin again
[12353.34s -> 12369.65s]  Strike your opponent. All right. I guess we're going to beat up kevin one more time before I go play soccer
[12388.16s -> 12390.16s]  This feels bad
[12425.22s -> 12429.06s]  So, how would you do this with two people in the room I've no I don't understand that
[12429.78s -> 12439.70s]  I think gaining health
[12457.47s -> 12461.31s]  Scream somebody just screamed
[12476.91s -> 12478.91s]  It was kevin's mom
[12500.83s -> 12507.70s]  It's gonna be this again hide my video I don't want you recording me
[12508.94s -> 12520.59s]  All right, let's try soccer
[12520.59s -> 12522.59s]  You owe kevin an apology
[12524.24s -> 12527.15s]  I'm sorry kevin
[12527.15s -> 12531.95s]  I did not mean to punch you in the face enough times where you were unconscious
[12537.68s -> 12556.64s]  Right, let's change this. Okay skill level. Let's go with professional. I like it action
[12557.20s -> 12578.16s]  Okay, now how do you do soccer on this of someone who really knows their soccer?
[12578.88s -> 12582.72s]  We are seconds away from kickoff now. So let's get down to some superb
[12583.92s -> 12604.40s]  No, I can move my hands
[12604.40s -> 12607.60s]  attacking kick in the direction you want to pass the ball
[12610.38s -> 12613.84s]  So go back turn this way kick
[12614.72s -> 12616.66s]  Okay
[12616.66s -> 12618.90s]  When you reach the goal kick to shoot
[12620.53s -> 12621.49s]  Kick
[12621.49s -> 12625.76s]  That's a very high quality animation. That looks great
[12629.57s -> 12630.53s]  All right
[12630.53s -> 12633.58s]  I'm gonna go for it
[12637.68s -> 12651.26s]  That's a throw in but slide or
[12654.22s -> 12656.22s]  The line shows you where the ball will go
[12660.62s -> 12662.62s]  All right, get in the path
[12662.70s -> 12664.70s]  And then what put the foot up?
[12665.09s -> 12668.99s]  Heal the ball
[12668.99s -> 12672.27s]  Get any part of your body to the target to save the shot
[12673.66s -> 12676.45s]  Okay
[12676.45s -> 12678.45s]  This is gonna be I think it's gonna be fun
[12678.69s -> 12680.69s]  This would be pretty interesting actually
[12680.69s -> 12685.98s]  Here we go
[12685.98s -> 12692.98s]  The keeper now kicks the ball to a fellow player
[12693.70s -> 12701.47s]  Kick it up here
[12701.47s -> 12702.51s]  score
[12702.51s -> 12719.38s]  Over that one
[12719.38s -> 12739.78s]  shit
[12739.78s -> 12741.78s]  Look at that replay
[12742.26s -> 12745.06s]  That replay was fucking so stupid
[12747.73s -> 12749.73s]  Clears the ball upfield
[12770.88s -> 12772.88s]  What
[12779.95s -> 12797.81s]  Come on what did I pass it backwards? All right
[12810.38s -> 12812.38s]  That's a penalty
[12822.24s -> 12826.40s]  Get it again
[12841.17s -> 12865.34s]  This is fun, I like this one clear of the goal mount what oh shit
[12873.92s -> 12886.32s]  I don't even know how to do that style shot. What is a style shot?
[12890.56s -> 12894.48s]  Ah, here we go. I was wondering if you could do that
[12908.24s -> 12915.98s]  What does that
[12926.91s -> 12928.91s]  Fuck gotta do it again
[12937.49s -> 12940.93s]  He's cheering i'm cheering him on go for it. You can do it
[12942.91s -> 12947.49s]  good kick
[12947.49s -> 12948.77s]  No
[12948.77s -> 12955.15s]  No
[12955.15s -> 12956.83s]  I was paying attention
[12956.83s -> 12971.36s]  That was a workout
[12972.88s -> 12980.03s]  Why does it look like my pants my pants don't
[12980.99s -> 12984.90s]  Why my lower body looks like it's not part of my upper body
[12985.54s -> 12989.76s]  All right. Why do I have like humpy dumpy pants?
[12990.56s -> 12992.86s]  Doesn't look like somebody like just screwed me on
[12993.74s -> 13005.50s]  It's weird. It's a two per yeah, it's two person
[13006.14s -> 13012.27s]  All right change for it
[13012.27s -> 13019.86s]  All right, I got uh beach volleyball. I'm gonna do
[13020.58s -> 13026.06s]  What do I want to do?
[13026.06s -> 13028.06s]  Table tennis sounds like fun
[13032.22s -> 13034.22s]  Bowling i'll do bowling after we'll do one
[13034.46s -> 13041.25s]  Stay with that professional skill level, too
[13041.73s -> 13053.10s]  That makes the most sense
[13055.10s -> 13063.63s]  So it's right in I think so we've got a professional gamer here
[13065.34s -> 13067.34s]  I'm gonna take a shower after this
[13069.50s -> 13071.50s]  I'm like 5 000 degrees right now
[13075.52s -> 13079.76s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna take a bath. I'm just gonna lie in the bath. I'm gonna lie in the bathroom
[13079.76s -> 13081.84s]  Just go under just move my hair around
[13082.64s -> 13087.95s]  I'm not doing those movements
[13088.03s -> 13101.14s]  Oops for this match
[13101.14s -> 13104.98s]  Reach to the right or left would you call yourself a table tennis star?
[13105.70s -> 13107.70s]  Reach with your arm straight out
[13107.86s -> 13111.54s]  I'd call myself a only play table tennis when it's part of a video game like this
[13112.42s -> 13114.42s]  And never any other surface
[13116.58s -> 13120.30s]  Same thing with tennis
[13120.30s -> 13123.50s]  Tennis to me whenever I played tennis was always just to end up being
[13124.06s -> 13126.78s]  Okay, here we go. It's really really a finesse based game
[13126.86s -> 13130.46s]  But you just yeah, I just hit it so hard every time it just soars over the whole thing
[13131.50s -> 13132.86s]  I can't do it
[13132.86s -> 13135.98s]  It'll be like i'll get one volley like don't don't
[13137.17s -> 13139.81s]  And the thing will just it's like I I can't do it. It's gone
[13143.31s -> 13145.31s]  It always goes like way out of control
[13149.10s -> 13151.81s]  Move backwards that shit. Sorry. All right, let's go
[13153.60s -> 13156.40s]  With the paddle right hand to the action we go
[13166.59s -> 13179.46s]  Stop celebrating you idiot
[13181.22s -> 13183.22s]  We're off screen
[13183.30s -> 13198.19s]  I'm just staying way back
[13202.94s -> 13205.10s]  That's it I got it right on the side
[13205.82s -> 13214.58s]  That works
[13223.79s -> 13227.12s]  All right, i'm gonna go as hard as I can
[13245.92s -> 13247.92s]  You stink
[13260.88s -> 13262.88s]  Fuck I was trying to give him a thing to serve up
[13269.50s -> 13271.50s]  You know how much it costs
[13271.50s -> 13273.50s]  to license that song
[13273.74s -> 13275.42s]  for it to play
[13275.42s -> 13277.42s]  for one or two seconds
[13279.50s -> 13282.54s]  That has that has to be hundreds of thousands of dollars to license that song
[13283.26s -> 13287.74s]  You're gonna have a whole montage with that song or it's not worth it
[13289.12s -> 13291.12s]  Okay, okay
[13310.22s -> 13321.73s]  That's so stupid I crossed the plane of the connect that was a smash
[13327.34s -> 13329.34s]  And turn the fucking song off
[13345.90s -> 13363.06s]  Yeah, that's at six five I got my eye on you buddy, this is an even game such an evenly matched game this
[13372.98s -> 13377.07s]  Shit
[13423.20s -> 13433.97s]  I'm gonna lose. I'm out of gas. I've breathed a gas already. It's only been like four and a half hours. I'm out of gas already
[13449.79s -> 13467.07s]  Yeah
[13484.90s -> 13492.70s]  A great match joke. Oh well intense
[13495.94s -> 13499.17s]  That didn't even been four hours it's been four
[13505.90s -> 13516.93s]  I know it's got the d to my property. Is that what we were playing for? I wasn't aware
[13526.05s -> 13528.05s]  All right time for bowling
[13528.11s -> 13530.11s]  Everybody wants to see bowling
[13530.29s -> 13560.30s]  Throw your hands overhead. All right, let's go
[13560.86s -> 13567.15s]  It's kind of getting dark in here. I think I need to turn the lights up just a little
[13568.40s -> 13570.40s]  While we have some lighting
[13577.52s -> 13582.80s]  Neon lanes enjoy welcome and thanks for joining for what looks like
[13591.95s -> 13603.62s]  Spin on the ball maybe possibly reach to the right or left to pick up a ball
[13605.44s -> 13607.44s]  Reach with your arms straight out
[13607.92s -> 13609.68s]  Okay, and then back
[13609.68s -> 13610.88s]  forward
[13610.88s -> 13614.56s]  Swing your arms straight back and then forwards to bowl the ball
[13616.93s -> 13618.93s]  Yeah, what about spin?
[13621.54s -> 13633.50s]  Spin is very important. What how do I do it? If you want to add spin bring your arm across your body
[13639.26s -> 13657.82s]  Let's go
[13657.82s -> 13669.60s]  Not bad. Not bad
[13669.76s -> 13676.66s]  Interesting approach there
[13676.66s -> 13678.66s]  All right, sarge your turn
[13679.74s -> 13685.57s]  Oh, you got a strike, okay
[13686.35s -> 13697.68s]  I would have loved to seen it
[13697.68s -> 13699.68s]  No, i'm trying to do like a cool thing
[13706.14s -> 13726.22s]  That means you got to okay i'll believe it sure
[13734.03s -> 13742.35s]  Bullshit spare
[13742.75s -> 13745.98s]  Oh, come on
[13745.98s -> 13747.26s]  That sucks
[13747.26s -> 13750.78s]  It's a product placement ball
[13750.94s -> 13761.73s]  How so this guy just only gets strikes?
[13762.37s -> 13772.16s]  Give one to me, too. Uh
[13772.16s -> 13784.27s]  spare
[13784.27s -> 13785.87s]  finally
[13785.87s -> 13788.24s]  Geez
[13788.24s -> 13790.24s]  I have to earn these
[13790.96s -> 13796.00s]  Well, it's all right. He'll choke like four or five times three pins two pins three pins three pins four pins three pins three pins I win
[13798.24s -> 13815.18s]  I'm getting destroyed
[13818.43s -> 13820.43s]  I would have been cool, but I actually spun
[13829.46s -> 13837.52s]  Yes, this game tried to one up we sports you can smell the desperation
[13849.92s -> 13851.92s]  I have to get some strikes where this is it
[13859.28s -> 13860.64s]  Come on
[13860.64s -> 13862.88s]  We sports is way better
[13862.88s -> 13865.84s]  We remember like we sports you could like go all the way back here and be like
[13866.48s -> 13868.72s]  Bang and it would spin all the way down
[13869.68s -> 13873.78s]  You could go like what?
[13888.22s -> 13890.22s]  Wasn't average uh bowling
[13891.79s -> 13893.63s]  score
[13893.63s -> 13895.63s]  Like 150 120
[13896.03s -> 13901.79s]  It's not the other how did it spin the other way?
[13903.36s -> 13905.42s]  How did it spin the other way?
[13905.42s -> 13919.18s]  You know fuck it. We're going on here
[13946.66s -> 13949.38s]  I didn't think you could do I didn't think you could do that
[13957.65s -> 13959.65s]  You can actually break it
[13966.02s -> 13968.26s]  That's this is better than we sports because of that alone
[13970.11s -> 13971.92s]  Might be
[13971.92s -> 13977.28s]  Oh, no, you got eight pins for the first time. Oh, no, who knows? Oh god. Oh god
[13978.16s -> 13990.70s]  That's not I was trying to do the diaper technique
[13990.94s -> 13994.27s]  It went wet that went way too fast what i'm trying to do
[14004.56s -> 14008.56s]  Anytime somebody makes fun of you when you go bowling
[14009.20s -> 14013.10s]  Let's take and you do that and you get like four or five strikes
[14014.24s -> 14016.24s]  Don't ever feel ashamed of that
[14016.90s -> 14018.90s]  Well people listen echo like
[14021.34s -> 14023.34s]  No, cool cool
[14023.42s -> 14025.42s]  I went like this
[14025.42s -> 14028.46s]  Straight down going really slow enough to every single fucking pin over
[14029.36s -> 14032.32s]  It's not how cool you look doing it. It's how many pins you knock down
[14033.12s -> 14044.43s]  That'd be not true
[14044.43s -> 14048.34s]  It's how many pins you knock down
[14048.34s -> 14051.78s]  You could turn around backwards and go like this through your legs
[14052.42s -> 14054.98s]  That doesn't matter. Did you knock down all the pins?
[14082.14s -> 14084.14s]  94 not even 100
[14099.30s -> 14104.08s]  Bullshit absolute dog shit
[14113.09s -> 14117.81s]  I leveled up some real highlights in that game
[14118.61s -> 14135.71s]  He's still level one. I well, how do you level up in this game?
[14136.59s -> 14138.83s]  I don't get it. I don't understand
[14142.38s -> 14144.38s]  You lost to 10 pinwheels
[14145.02s -> 14148.32s]  Clever
[14148.32s -> 14150.80s]  That was that was cute. That was cute. You're right
[14159.14s -> 14163.54s]  All right tracking field. I feel like i'm gonna do really good at it. Just moving your body violently around in the circle
[14163.78s -> 14165.70s]  We're gonna go champion. I'm gonna get here we go
[14170.05s -> 14174.05s]  This is all about just moving violently like shaking violently
[14176.69s -> 14177.97s]  I should nail it
[14177.97s -> 14187.65s]  You're gonna break a bone
[14187.73s -> 14190.13s]  That's not you can't break your bone here unless I like slipped
[14190.93s -> 14191.25s]  Okay
[14191.25s -> 14196.45s]  If I was going like freaking out like wildly moving around and then I went like that my leg flew up underneath and I
[14196.61s -> 14198.61s]  Went back and landed like on my neck or something
[14200.21s -> 14214.66s]  But that's impossible
[14214.66s -> 14216.26s]  What happened to my hair?
[14216.26s -> 14221.22s]  I just have a hat on so it's easy to keep it away from like because I you saw how it looked the other time
[14221.30s -> 14222.58s]  We played this
[14222.58s -> 14224.82s]  It was all over the place. It looked crazy
[14226.26s -> 14229.72s]  I looked crazy and I didn't want to look crazed anymore
[14233.22s -> 14237.86s]  Comes the falling gag 100 meter finals. Now you can feel the tension
[14241.62s -> 14243.62s]  Okay, let's go shake
[14244.74s -> 14247.22s]  Run in place lift your knees
[14248.10s -> 14251.70s]  See here what's here's what i'm gonna try here because i'm not taking my knees i'm not taking my feet off the ground
[14252.18s -> 14254.18s]  See if I can just go with my back here
[14254.34s -> 14265.47s]  i'm just
[14265.47s -> 14270.43s]  Hey, what you doing mind and body in perfect harmony. That's what breaks world records
[14270.91s -> 14275.20s]  All right, here we go
[14275.20s -> 14301.04s]  Keeping your own way. Oh, that's like pretending to be an airplane
[14309.60s -> 14311.60s]  All right javelin I will
[14318.61s -> 14320.61s]  I'll just go again
[14321.49s -> 14324.77s]  Grab a javelin reach with your arms straight out
[14325.57s -> 14328.43s]  Okay
[14328.43s -> 14330.67s]  Run in place to get to the throw zone
[14333.09s -> 14342.27s]  Hold the javelin when the ground turns green throw the javelin throw
[14343.07s -> 14353.38s]  Throw high. All right. That was pretty. All right, let's go
[14354.10s -> 14360.90s]  And this throw needs to be good
[14372.37s -> 14374.37s]  What the fuck come on, man?
[14375.17s -> 14393.44s]  Now the results from that event have been processed. We can see where we're at 32 is so bad
[14394.40s -> 14396.40s]  Failure is not an option
[14399.90s -> 14422.82s]  Make what you will of that
[14423.86s -> 14428.50s]  Third throw now, how do these athletes cope with such tension?
[14429.46s -> 14439.76s]  Oh my fucking god
[14439.84s -> 14449.02s]  Let's see how that event's results affect where we stand
[14450.06s -> 14452.80s]  At this point in time, that's how it's looking
[14453.68s -> 14459.04s]  Then what's the spring javelin high jump discuss what are we discussing?
[14460.40s -> 14466.00s]  Is that like a debate platform run in place to get to the jump zone
[14467.62s -> 14469.22s]  Lift your knees
[14469.22s -> 14474.08s]  I will I will destroy the discuss
[14474.88s -> 14478.80s]  I could sit there and talk about anything for hours. I will people will leave because i'll bore them
[14479.68s -> 14481.68s]  Okay, so run room jump
[14481.68s -> 14525.12s]  I have to like explode out of this a firm footing and is what's needed here. It's got to be a record
[14525.76s -> 14538.37s]  The previous event's results make
[14540.13s -> 14545.78s]  Second jump and an improvement is vital now. Stop moving
[14554.21s -> 14557.47s]  Fucking dumb game
[14557.47s -> 14559.55s]  I don't know how to like make it go faster
[14560.51s -> 14564.43s]  Just take a look at the results from the previous event
[14567.76s -> 14569.20s]  No, stop
[14569.20s -> 14581.09s]  I figured it out. I figured it out
[14589.17s -> 14594.98s]  The result now from the previous event and look at that
[14595.78s -> 14600.58s]  A lead is starting to open up. This competition is really close
[14601.22s -> 14603.86s]  Thank you for dropping into the discus event
[14604.74s -> 14606.74s]  Okay, disgust throwing
[14606.82s -> 14609.14s]  I think when you stand
[14609.22s -> 14615.54s]  At a certain length of way and you throw it the most power comes from when you're spinning around the momentum
[14618.40s -> 14621.22s]  Lol
[14622.74s -> 14639.62s]  That's it don't you just spin face to build from with their first attempt
[14657.79s -> 14660.22s]  If I went like this
[14662.30s -> 14666.56s]  I'm just a fucking clown. I'm like the comedy routine that's here at the olympics
[14667.20s -> 14681.11s]  The pressure is on straight into the sky
[14683.44s -> 14688.23s]  Like that person's not even trying that person's not trying
[14692.05s -> 14698.23s]  As we thought third throw and if ever there had to be success
[14703.24s -> 14706.76s]  Results from the last event and my my take a look
[14708.60s -> 14712.04s]  Take a look at these scores who would have believed it
[14713.44s -> 14720.88s]  It's daunting for the athletes, but the hurdles are next. I can't do it
[14721.68s -> 14723.68s]  I need some fucking help
[14726.32s -> 14735.03s]  Lift your knees
[14735.03s -> 14738.63s]  As soon as the hurdle turns green jump in place
[14740.80s -> 14742.80s]  Jump with both feet off the ground
[14759.59s -> 14763.11s]  Do any of these athletes have what it takes to beat the current world record?
[14771.28s -> 14789.52s]  Oh, why is it in my way?
[14798.55s -> 14809.05s]  You know what fuck all this I ain't crossing
[14810.01s -> 14875.27s]  Athlete it was the taking part that mattered you that's like i'm trying not to fall over
[14882.38s -> 14884.86s]  That's like i'm shimmying on the edge of the cliff
[14885.42s -> 14901.08s]  Volleyball is the last one time for some beach volleyball
[14914.18s -> 14917.38s]  How many connect games came out for the xbox one?
[14919.18s -> 14920.86s]  I want to say three
[14920.86s -> 14930.58s]  There was so many but 360
[14935.45s -> 14938.41s]  All right, so volleyball is just table tennis for the bigger ball larger people
[14939.37s -> 14956.14s]  Well podrick paddles
[14960.22s -> 14962.22s]  You gotta be tall to play volleyball
[14966.04s -> 14968.92s]  All volleyball players ever known for like six two
[14972.34s -> 14974.34s]  You gotta like get over the net and like stuff
[14987.96s -> 14992.36s]  People paddle toss the ball upwards then hit it with your hand as it falls
[15001.56s -> 15004.92s]  Move to the target and hit the ball with your hand and then
[15012.15s -> 15019.99s]  Jump as soon as the jump indicator appears jump and jump and then you have to stop it jump jump
[15022.73s -> 15031.35s]  All right, I got it
[15038.79s -> 15040.79s]  What just fucking happened
[15043.37s -> 15061.08s]  I have no idea what's going on. Okay service passes to the other side now synchronization for this guy
[15068.60s -> 15070.60s]  Oh big dive
[15100.04s -> 15113.46s]  Oh nice
[15128.18s -> 15147.53s]  Shit my my my body is so sweaty. I can't keep my earphones in
[15158.42s -> 15182.20s]  Two hands
[15183.96s -> 15191.32s]  Is that legal
[15208.52s -> 15210.52s]  Serve it up, let's go
[15212.04s -> 15226.42s]  Jump higher than that. Why are you waiting so long? You're killing me
[15228.14s -> 15230.14s]  Change it. He's killing me
[15230.78s -> 15241.21s]  The team are playing like clockwork today
[15256.01s -> 15282.90s]  Come on pretty good
[15302.39s -> 15307.96s]  I'm blaming it all on my teammate. See how far i've jumped i've jumped really high
[15325.08s -> 15327.00s]  I am too
[15327.00s -> 15332.70s]  I just threw the game i'm tired
[15334.98s -> 15336.34s]  i'm tired
[15336.34s -> 15344.34s]  Nothing in the air. How can you not take a picture in the air?
[15347.10s -> 15351.34s]  Like why give me up here jumping in the come on, you don't want to be in there
[15352.30s -> 15366.44s]  I want to get some water
[15366.44s -> 15450.47s]  water time
[15450.47s -> 15451.51s]  All right
[15451.51s -> 15463.91s]  I'm back. So what can I do now?
[15463.99s -> 15470.44s]  I need to slam something
[15470.92s -> 15472.92s]  My oxygen tank
[15475.35s -> 15477.83s]  I can't do it anymore. I just can't do it
[15478.71s -> 15483.45s]  What what's more game?
[15483.53s -> 15487.94s]  mini games
[15487.94s -> 15491.03s]  one bowl roll
[15491.03s -> 15492.47s]  one bowl roll
[15492.47s -> 15495.24s]  What is that?
[15504.63s -> 15506.63s]  I guess you just roll it once
[15509.19s -> 15511.19s]  Don't worry xbox. I'm gonna
[15511.59s -> 15516.79s]  i'm gonna
[15516.79s -> 15520.31s]  in like another 15 to 20 minutes, i'm gonna probably call it
[15521.11s -> 15526.23s]  I don't know what it is, but you know what it is. It's probably because I was like sick over the last like yesterday the day before
[15527.45s -> 15529.53s]  My like physical energy levels are like zero
[15530.33s -> 15546.41s]  All right, here we go. Oh, I said, okay, I get it
[15559.42s -> 15565.06s]  Get it finicky is too it's not like the levo. You know what I mean? It's like
[15566.02s -> 15586.38s]  I shred the connect
[15597.64s -> 15604.23s]  Give me one
[15604.23s -> 15608.76s]  zero
[15608.76s -> 15611.35s]  Just roll it straight
[15611.35s -> 15614.63s]  I'm sorry. Hold on. Let me play. Let me roll a ball on the connect

[17994.14s -> 17997.18s]  Still as a board and turning your shoulders you kind of look like this
[18004.28s -> 18007.32s]  So many of these games required so much like random t posing

[18045.98s -> 18047.26s]  Don't you go?
[18047.26s -> 18049.90s]  More than 50 60 70 miles per hour on this thing
[18050.54s -> 18053.42s]  Can you imagine the speeds?
[18058.82s -> 18061.19s]  you just on like
[18061.43s -> 18063.43s]  What abouts to a potato wedge?
