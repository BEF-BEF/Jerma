[0.63s -> 13.64s]  Stream's bopping. Stream will be bopping. Stream is currently bopping. Hey, welcome back. Hope you
[13.64s -> 25.53s]  had a good Monday. I had a good Monday. I had a great Monday. Tuesday is now. Hopefully we have a
[25.53s -> 37.59s]  good Tuesday too. Every day of the week is hopefully a good day. Today we're gonna do something I've
[37.59s -> 43.56s]  been looking forward to for a while since it was announced. We're gonna play Ancestors the
[43.56s -> 53.34s]  Humankind Odyssey. It's a game where you play as an ape and you have to evolve in this permadeath.
[57.05s -> 64.89s]  I don't know much else. I have, I'll be honest, I have read the reviews. They're very bad.
[66.44s -> 77.83s]  But who cares about reviews? You think I give a shit about a review? They're not great. Let's
[77.83s -> 90.38s]  just put it that way. You think I care? I'll review the game when I'm done. And you can trust my review
[90.38s -> 98.97s]  because it's from, it's from the heart and it's from the brain connected. Equal parts brain and
[98.97s -> 110.42s]  equal parts heart. You get the true review. But you're not gonna get that. You're gonna get me
[110.42s -> 116.95s]  playing the game for as long as it takes. There's also something I want to talk about real quick.
[118.22s -> 124.30s]  I want to talk about the activity book stream. Some of you know what this is. Some of you don't
[124.30s -> 127.50s]  know what this is. I have not really gone into detail on it and I'm gonna do it right now
[128.22s -> 131.85s]  because I've been pushing it off and pushing it off and I don't want to do that anymore.
[131.85s -> 135.53s]  So what is the activity? The activity book stream is going to be a stream
[136.33s -> 145.05s]  where some community content is made and is put into a highlights style activity book.
[145.85s -> 153.59s]  We're talking dot to dots. All community themed by the way. Dot to dots. Where's Waldo? Me? Well,
[153.59s -> 159.19s]  it's gonna be where's Jerma? You know, you gotta get that point across. And other random brain
[159.19s -> 166.02s]  teasers and activities and coloring books and shit. This is all supposed to be next week.
[167.11s -> 173.00s]  The deadline for submissions for this is currently the 31st. But I'm gonna move that forward because
[173.00s -> 177.00s]  I don't think that's enough time because I haven't really talked about it. It's been in the discord
[177.00s -> 181.88s]  for a little while. It's only in the discord. Please, if you want to submit something, which
[181.88s -> 186.49s]  it is a full submission for anybody in the community that wants to do this. There are a
[186.49s -> 190.81s]  few things that I'm going to commission out on my own. But stuff like dot to dot and if you don't
[190.81s -> 197.45s]  know what a dot to dot image is, it's when there's the template of dots and they're numbered and you
[197.45s -> 203.69s]  have to connect, you know, 123 to 100 200 whatever it is, then it makes an image. But I want to do
[203.69s -> 211.46s]  this thing. It seemed like a fun idea. Read the rules in the discord if you want to participate.
[211.46s -> 219.77s]  The new deadline for submissions for those activities is going to be, are you listening?
[219.77s -> 232.36s]  Are you listening? September 3rd is the last day that you can submit something. Not everything
[232.36s -> 235.96s]  will be chosen. We're going to choose some of the ones we think are obviously a little bit better
[235.96s -> 240.04s]  or more interesting or fun. There'll be some shitposts. Don't worry. I probably should have
[240.04s -> 243.48s]  just given the blanket statement there that you can do shitposts because I shouldn't, I don't
[243.48s -> 256.12s]  think I should have said that. And then the actual stream will be the 7th of September. This is not
[256.12s -> 262.23s]  some huge deal, right? This is not, oh my god, this is a fucking huge stream. It's just a fun
[262.23s -> 269.42s]  thing I want to do. Probably take a few hours. To give more detail on some of the things,
[270.38s -> 276.06s]  we can do it a little bit later. I think more people are here. But I want, where's Waldo?
[276.95s -> 280.55s]  So you can make an image of, if you don't know what a where's Waldo, you kind of need to like
[280.55s -> 285.75s]  know what all these things are before making them, I guess. But there's going to be like 10 to 12
[285.75s -> 292.79s]  where's Waldo's, but it's me, 10 to 12, maybe 15 dot to dots, 10 to 12 brain teasers written by
[292.79s -> 299.37s]  somebody in the community, 10 to 12 jokes, 10 to 12 coloring pages. There's a whole thing in the
[299.37s -> 303.30s]  discord. Read those rules, take a look for yourself. And if you want to participate, go for it. If you
[303.30s -> 313.29s]  don't, then enjoy it when it happens. Now let's turn into a monkey. That sounds good to me.
[321.67s -> 330.92s]  Game sucks next already. No. Ancestors. This game is going to be wild. It's going to be intense.
[331.56s -> 335.88s]  You're probably going to see a couple of like, I'm probably going to be like, fuck. At one point,
[335.88s -> 343.90s]  I just want to warn everybody for the bad language coming up here. Because there is permadeath.
[344.70s -> 349.18s]  I want, do you think I can get through this whole thing without dying? Absolutely not.
[349.82s -> 363.30s]  Here we go. You're going to see a couple of fails. Lineage name. This is the name of all
[363.30s -> 372.84s]  through history. So we've got to think back like 60 million years ago, like a hundred million years
[372.84s -> 383.75s]  ago. Were there any Elbertsons back then? No, guys, they were no Elbertsons. Elbertson is a
[383.75s -> 391.53s]  European name. It means guy who makes shoes. I was like, my family is like the shoe blacksmith.
[392.90s -> 406.97s]  So I, there's no way. Write it. Why can I not write this? Lineage name. Can I not type a name?
[412.66s -> 422.68s]  Why can I not name this? Lineage name. Why can't I type in here? No, there's something going on.
[422.68s -> 433.94s]  Something weird. There we go. Right? Yes. I can't. I'm just going to be the Elbertsons.
[435.34s -> 441.10s]  This is where it started. My family's been making shoes for millions of years.
[446.06s -> 453.85s]  Choose your game experience first time. What do you mean? How could you do a second time? Explore,
[453.85s -> 458.57s]  expand, and evolve by experimenting what our oldest ancestors had to face.
[459.37s -> 464.65s]  Player help. Choose the level of assistance. Full HUD, full tutorial.
[465.45s -> 471.37s]  Full HUD, no tutorial. Minimal HUD, full tutorial. No HUD, no tutorial.
[472.87s -> 484.68s]  How am I supposed to play the game? I'm not doing that. Full HUD, full tutorial. How about,
[484.68s -> 492.06s]  how about minimal HUD, full, I'm, no, I have to do this like minimal HUD, full tutorial. Okay,
[492.30s -> 501.22s]  that sounds okay. You guys are going to have to help me here. No balls. That's fine.
[502.58s -> 524.98s]  Minimal HUD, full tutorial. We're just going to go random. Got it. Here we go. Lineage Elbertsons,
[524.98s -> 531.46s]  game mode, first time, settlement, hidden waterfall oasis, female, clan size, medium.
[531.46s -> 540.36s]  I didn't get to pick my clan. Here we go. Mama Elbertson is going to take us home here.
[541.00s -> 562.30s]  Here it is. The first ever human to ever be recorded. Inspired by true events. All right.
[564.38s -> 568.46s]  You can't, you can't say that. I don't think that's... The world and characters you will
[568.46s -> 572.46s]  encounter are meant to represent archetypes of a place and of a moment, not the exact depiction.
[573.10s -> 580.22s]  This adventure was made by Panache Digital Games, which is composed of all these people
[581.62s -> 587.40s]  based on a true story. Yeah, but we don't know. They didn't write this stuff down.
[588.12s -> 600.68s]  You can't say based on a true story, based on a bone. With the help of... They did.
[601.56s -> 604.52s]  In the following hours, you will relive the challenges of the dawn of humanity.
[605.56s -> 610.12s]  Based on a true bone, embark into the never-ending odyssey of human progression on this planet.
[611.24s -> 618.41s]  Use your body, senses, mind, and voice to guide your voyages. Gain strength in numbers and advance
[618.41s -> 627.42s]  the species. Survive the elements. Teach your family. Build a home. Make sure to watch your
[627.42s -> 637.37s]  food and thirst meters. We won't help you very much. And remember, evolution is not set in stone.
[637.37s -> 647.29s]  It is your path to forge. This is very loud. Yes. Where am I? Do I land on like a comet?
[648.09s -> 661.51s]  This is how it started. We crash landed on fucking comets. Let's be... Got it. First try. Ah,
[661.51s -> 665.70s]  fuck, I dropped it. It's all right. There's probably more of those. That's probably the currency.
[666.50s -> 686.41s]  Watch out! Look at all these animals. They have every animal. Wait, was this... weren't they dinosaurs?
[689.64s -> 702.10s]  This is supposed to be like 500 million years ago. All right, well then that guy's got like...
[705.85s -> 713.61s]  Uh-oh, watch out. Here comes the... It's the Jaguar thing. Jaguars attacked alligators? They did?
[714.25s -> 719.13s]  No, they didn't. Based on one true bone. They dug up a bone and now they can tell me that
[719.13s -> 732.14s]  that panther attacked that alligator. I don't think so. Where do we start? Ancestors with
[732.14s -> 741.53s]  human kind arms. Eventually, you'll be working in a fucking office. Volume one, before us.
[745.08s -> 772.74s]  Okay. Is this us? This is us. All right. We got the fish. We got to eat it. Watch out for the bird!
[784.87s -> 792.17s]  Holy shit. Okay. Regain safety in a hiding spot or in your clan's... What the fuck is
[792.17s -> 800.39s]  going on? Why are they like specters? Tap Y to use your intelligence. Use to identify a hiding spot,
[800.95s -> 808.07s]  your clan settlement, or other practical items. What? I'm a baby. Okay, so this is intelligence.
[809.13s -> 815.53s]  Don't move to stay in intelligence. Look around. Right stick to highlight point of interest,
[815.53s -> 819.29s]  then follow the steps displayed on the contextual UI. So, okay, over there.
[820.17s -> 833.75s]  Right? Go towards the square. All right, let's go towards the square. Why are these all these
[833.99s -> 856.39s]  like nightmare images? What do you mean? I can't like drown. Now what do you want me to do? Yeah,
[856.39s -> 876.44s]  I know a hiding spot. Latibolum. Oh, all right. How do I sprint? How do you punch? Dude, why do
[876.44s -> 885.37s]  they keep doing this? I don't want to see anymore of these weird like 3D animations. There it is.
[885.77s -> 892.79s]  All right, I found it. Sense of hearing. Don't move to stay in the senses. This is the representation
[892.79s -> 911.51s]  of the sounds within range. Look around to target a sound. What? Minimal fucking tutorial,
[911.51s -> 921.67s]  minimal HUD. I found the hiding spot. It's right here. It said look around for the sound and then
[921.67s -> 942.98s]  what did it want me to do? What is that? Another... another person? What is that? Food? Current clan
[942.98s -> 953.69s]  settlement. Okay, well, let's... let me go into the hiding spot. Am I hiding? Is this a hiding spot?
[958.23s -> 962.63s]  Grabbing foliage and creepers. Jump and hold A to grab the foliage or the creepers when press
[962.63s -> 967.59s]  passing through it. Trunks, branches, and rock walls are... what the hell is that next to me?
[967.59s -> 974.39s]  That's me. Okay, well, I fucking didn't even see what it was. Is it up here? Should I get up here?
[976.46s -> 995.77s]  No, look, this is right there. Hiding spot. How do I get in this hiding spot? How do I get in this?
[996.57s -> 1011.86s]  Okay, that was... I clearly was... I did it. Find the lost child of your clan. What do you mean?
[1013.75s -> 1024.06s]  Sprint L... L to move. Hold A to sprint. Release A to jump. All right. What do you mean find the
[1024.06s -> 1032.22s]  lost baby? To cancel jump. Stop moving before releasing A. Okay, well, I... I just grabbed
[1032.22s -> 1036.50s]  something. I just grabbed like a stick. All right, I got a stick in my hands. I'm ready to fight.
[1037.46s -> 1052.62s]  Growing Neuron. Who are these people? Are these friends? All right, it said we won't tell you
[1052.62s -> 1061.27s]  anything, so I just have flowers in my hands. What am I supposed to be doing? Look at all these
[1061.27s -> 1069.58s]  things. Okay, what about over here? Don't know what this is. My intelligence is gaining
[1069.58s -> 1073.82s]  because I looked over here at like the briar patch. I know what that is now, apparently. Hold on.
[1074.62s -> 1093.21s]  Is that the baby crying? Tap X to use your senses to help you locate any member of your clan.
[1093.21s -> 1106.57s]  Okay. Down there. All right, I gotta be careful. Can I... I'm coming to save you.
[1108.87s -> 1111.19s]  That was scary. I'm not gonna lie. All right, how do I get down from here?
[1120.30s -> 1134.97s]  What? I couldn't even read that. What did it say? Spring... Got you. Okay. Tap B, then wait for the
[1134.97s -> 1139.69s]  answers to progressively comfort the kid. Lower the temperature. Take the time to listen. What the
[1139.69s -> 1171.00s]  fuck are you talking about? Why are we doing this? It's me! Oh, thank goodness. So that's...
[1171.00s -> 1180.71s]  Is this me? Which one is me? Join your clan in the settlement. All right. So here's the thing. How
[1180.71s -> 1187.78s]  do you swing and how do you climb? The tutorial was on the screen for five seconds. Can I look
[1187.78s -> 1195.67s]  at tutorials? Adult, female, single, fertile. Okay, hold on. Options, controls, intelligence,
[1195.67s -> 1211.83s]  emotions, concentrations, emotions. It didn't tell me anything. All right. I don't know how
[1211.83s -> 1222.58s]  to grab a vine. All right. Let's listen. Let's see. Where was the settlement again? Let me zoom in.
[1222.58s -> 1231.10s]  Let me just take a look at some stuff over here. What is this? You don't know. Right. Okay. I don't
[1232.30s -> 1243.85s]  know what's over there. Where was my settlement? It's up here, right? There it is. All right. So
[1243.85s -> 1255.82s]  get up there. Up that way. Up this tree. Here we go. Is this like... Can I jump higher and grab?
[1258.14s -> 1271.69s]  No. I have to just hold. Motricity? Motricity? How can I go? I wish I knew how to actually hold
[1271.69s -> 1286.23s]  on to stuff. Do you even need to? Maybe you don't even need to. All right. I made it. Back in the
[1286.23s -> 1312.54s]  settlement. I could do this pretty well. Which one's me and which one's the game? That was the game.
[1313.18s -> 1334.84s]  What's going on here? What's going on? Why are we... Can your lineage evolve faster than our
[1334.84s -> 1348.04s]  ancestors did? I don't know. Can they? Avatar's vitality. Energy is limited by stamina, is limited
[1348.04s -> 1354.20s]  by life expectancy. Eat well, drink well, and sleep well to maintain a great stamina. Avoid injuries
[1354.20s -> 1362.25s]  and stay on the screen for more than 10 seconds. Stop moving to see all the contextual actions
[1362.25s -> 1371.22s]  offered. They vary according to your situation. Contextual actions. All right. Well, now what do
[1371.22s -> 1388.58s]  I do? Can I drink out of the stream? How do you drink? Okay. No, that's like... That's the taunt
[1388.58s -> 1392.57s]  button. Wait. Hold on. What? There's so many things to look at. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1395.74s -> 1400.94s]  What? Okay. When already discovered, dropped items can be stockpiled with identical items.
[1401.58s -> 1411.14s]  What are you talking about? I hit right bumper. Fucking minimal HUD. All right. So we can... You
[1411.14s -> 1419.16s]  grab with A. Hold X to inspect any item you have in the right hand. That's good to know. What is it?
[1419.88s -> 1423.96s]  How do I know what this is? I don't know what it is. This is just a green thing to me.
[1425.78s -> 1443.21s]  New food. Horsetail. How do I eat it? Just like corn on the cob.
[1446.98s -> 1451.30s]  Adaptable metabolism. Assimilated nutrients from the vegeta- vegetal kind of food.
[1452.26s -> 1459.66s]  How much do I have to eat? How much green corn do we have to eat? Oh, I'm teaching them. I get it.
[1462.46s -> 1465.34s]  See? Everyone, this is how you eat food. You pick it up and you eat it.
[1472.62s -> 1481.05s]  Okay. I learned communication. I'm going to learn how to talk. What else is there? Oh, can I eat this
[1481.05s -> 1494.70s]  too? Is this food? Examine. What could this be used for? What do you think? New tool. Grass sci-cad. New
[1494.70s -> 1502.66s]  tool. What can I use this with though? How do I use this? There's something over there. Take a shit
[1502.66s -> 1506.58s]  in the river. I'm glad- I'm glad that's what you want me to do. Oh, what's happening?
[1512.65s -> 1516.78s]  What is that? Why does he have lasers coming out of his mouth? Hold on. Wait. Come here.
[1517.50s -> 1530.44s]  What's this? Something over here. New species of fruit. What is it? Pick it up. What am I doing?
[1532.17s -> 1544.78s]  What's in here? Why can this be examined? Oh, am I drinking? How do I drink? How do you drink water?
[1545.34s -> 1551.51s]  Examine the water. I have to examine it. Oh, yes. I can drink this.
[1555.45s -> 1560.09s]  Aqua dulcis orego. Isn't it just- that's not it. It's H2O. It's hydrogen and oxygen. Twice.
[1565.58s -> 1578.09s]  All right. Let's go. How do I feed the kid? What's this stuff? Oh, berries. Are they poisonous?
[1578.81s -> 1597.66s]  Will I know? Poisonous berries? New food. This is going to poison me. No, I did. Okay. I guess we
[1597.66s -> 1602.22s]  can't eat these. We can eat these. Guys, we can eat these. Come over here. We can eat these berries.
[1602.94s -> 1612.33s]  Although, they might be poisonous. Should I not have taught them how to do this?
[1617.82s -> 1624.76s]  Wait. Wait. Don't eat them. Don't eat them. Stop eating those. I can't be for certain. I have to
[1624.76s -> 1635.21s]  wait until I have diarrhea. Okay. Something's wrong with me. I think I'm cold. I'm sorry.
[1635.69s -> 1648.90s]  I think we have to test it somehow. Okay. Don't eat those. Well, whoever that is,
[1648.90s -> 1655.99s]  we might not last very long. What's this? I'm gonna make a shelter. All right. Can I hold it
[1655.99s -> 1669.50s]  over his head? I just gave that to him? No. Having children nearby allows the accumulation of
[1669.50s -> 1678.36s]  neuronal energy. More children means increased accumulation. Turn the HUD on. I don't think I can.
[1679.00s -> 1684.41s]  Oh, fuck. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Vitality,
[1685.37s -> 1690.66s]  injuring, and poisoning. Poisoning comes from venom or by eating rotten or green food,
[1690.66s -> 1699.14s]  or by ingesting of toxic elements. When poisoned, find something with medicinal properties. Okay.
[1699.86s -> 1704.02s]  So I've been poisoned. Your organism can't assimilate nutrients from all kinds of food
[1704.02s -> 1710.23s]  right away. Some may cause a temporary poisoning. You can become omnivorous through neuronal
[1710.23s -> 1718.79s]  development. Okay. Attack. Hold A to prime dodging. Move to dodge.
[1719.96s -> 1725.96s]  Release A at the right time. Hold A to prime the counter attack. What the fuck do you mean? All
[1725.96s -> 1740.90s]  right. Let's just let's go look around. Everybody get over here. Don't be out there. A sleeping
[1740.90s -> 1745.94s]  spot. When built, a sleep spot is at the basis of every settlement. Tap A to lie down on a sleep
[1745.94s -> 1755.29s]  spot. Let me examine that as a sleep spot. There it is. All right. So I got it on the UI now.
[1755.29s -> 1772.73s]  I got it examined. Let's see what it does. And let's sleep. Can I go to bed? How long does it
[1772.73s -> 1792.73s]  take to go to sleep? Go to bed. Baby. Baby with spontaneous genetic mutation metabolism.
[1793.37s -> 1807.82s]  How do I turn the fucking HUD on? Yeah, I'm sorry. That ain't gonna happen. This is staying on.
[1813.08s -> 1818.44s]  I'm not gonna play. Let me learn the game first. Jesus. All right. Let's see. So I got
[1819.08s -> 1827.61s]  changed. So it's like Path of Exile. Okay, so here I am. Neuronal growth is complete.
[1827.61s -> 1833.51s]  Assign neuronal energy to initiate a new communication skill. Assign neuronal
[1833.51s -> 1844.06s]  energy to initiate a new motor skill. All right. I think I want some motor skills. The ability to
[1844.06s -> 1852.95s]  switch hands with an item is acquired. Tap LB to switch hands with an item. Nice. That has opened
[1852.95s -> 1859.48s]  up so many more things. All right. I can switch hands. Wow. What a development. What about down
[1859.48s -> 1867.14s]  here? Let's do some more communication. Okay. The ability to gather all clan members is acquired.
[1867.14s -> 1881.18s]  Hold B to gather all clan members and have them follow you. Okay. This looks huge. To launch an
[1881.18s -> 1886.38s]  evolution, you must be in your clan's active settlement. You've passed at least one generation
[1886.38s -> 1893.78s]  and succeeded in evolutionary feat. Okay. So I haven't done that yet. All right. So let's go to
[1894.10s -> 1904.54s]  That's it. We slept. We now can hold something in our other hand. Analyze. Baby. Love. This
[1904.54s -> 1917.26s]  spontaneous genetic. All right. Rename. New name. Yeah. Change name. Change name. No. I want to

[1953.96s -> 1962.02s]  Kaiser for the 10 community subs. Thank you. Appreciate it. How do I pick you up? Isn't this
[1962.02s -> 1985.53s]  my baby? Sleep. Sleep. Why is the time going so fast? What is that? Am I having a dream?
[1986.33s -> 1992.42s]  Oh yeah. Yesterday I looked at my hand. I have something outside of my arm that looks weird.
[1992.42s -> 2002.18s]  It's got five things on it. Dawn. All right. Let's get up at eight o'clock in the morning.
[2002.18s -> 2014.34s]  Here we go. Food. Water. Daily regimen update. I need some water. All right. Let's go. Everybody
[2014.34s -> 2020.38s]  come over here. Let's all drink water please. Everybody come over into the pond. Let's drink
[2020.38s -> 2042.71s]  some water. All of you. Come on. Together. Over here. All of you. See? How much is too much water?
[2044.76s -> 2050.89s]  We don't want to get over hydrated. All right. That's good. What about food? How am I doing on
[2050.89s -> 2058.68s]  food? Handling. Tap to switch hand. It will free the right hand to pick up something else.
[2059.32s -> 2068.01s]  All right. Here we go. Alter. What do you mean alter? Oh right. Some items may be altered with
[2068.01s -> 2087.85s]  bare hands or crafted. What? What am I doing? Oh picking the leaves off. All right. Dexterity.
[2099.62s -> 2123.74s]  Okay. Let's try it again. Should I do that again? How many times should I do this? Is there
[2123.74s -> 2137.85s]  anymore leaves to pull? This has to do something eventually, right? What? I don't know what this
[2137.85s -> 2152.68s]  is even for. What's this for? I don't understand. I don't know. I need. We need food. Food. Food.
[2152.68s -> 2158.39s]  Follow me. Everybody follow me. We gotta get food. Where's the food? Over here. What's that? Cold?
[2159.03s -> 2170.84s]  Okay. Wait. Hold on. Food. Is this food? Can I eat this? No. I can't eat this. Back to the
[2170.84s -> 2195.75s]  poison berries. Food. Found it. It's all mine. It's all mine. I'm the clan leader. Okay. Let's
[2195.75s -> 2206.60s]  analyze. Let's go. I want to go. Let's go somewhere. How about what's that? Identify. Memorize. The
[2206.60s -> 2212.60s]  location of anything you have identified can be memorized. There we go. Intelligence can also be
[2212.60s -> 2218.01s]  used to discover practical items and to visualize the things you have identified. Nice. All right.
[2218.73s -> 2242.20s]  That's so much better. So what's in here? I memorized this. I don't understand. All right.
[2242.20s -> 2249.46s]  I'm going. I gotta. I'm gonna go find. Wait. Food. Over here. Grain on the cob. Over here.
[2250.18s -> 2268.66s]  So what's wrong with me? What's my. I'm still like having problems. Where are the kids?
[2269.54s -> 2289.64s]  You. Come here. Okay. A rock. A stick. New tool. Dead branch. All right. Let's analyze it.
[2290.20s -> 2307.82s]  What am I doing? I'm just cutting my hand. Build a computer. I don't think I can. Well,
[2307.82s -> 2313.66s]  I want to pick up the rock. Rock. No. Rock. I saw the rock right on the ground. Right here.
[2313.66s -> 2328.41s]  Got it. All right. Rock. You can smash stuff with this. Okay. Granite rock. Can I do anything else
[2328.41s -> 2342.66s]  with this? Eat the rock. I think. I think the rock is funny. We learned comedy. All right. Can I like.
[2346.74s -> 2358.26s]  Uh. It makes a scratching noise. That's all this does. I'm trying to break a rock and
[2358.82s -> 2365.35s]  my hands. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stick. Okay. Wait. I have two rocks. I've got
[2365.35s -> 2385.82s]  two rocks. If I hit rocks together. That makes a fire. Eventually. Fuck. Wait. Give me. Wait.

[2396.50s -> 2406.86s]  got rock and branch. No. Pick the fucking rock up. You idiot. Okay. Here we go. Rock and branch.
[2410.17s -> 2423.56s]  Rock to branch doesn't do anything. I don't think. Shit. Branch and. There. Take this rock.
[2440.42s -> 2452.12s]  Hold and wait for the audio cue. Oh, we like each other. Okay. Copy paste. Tell them. Somebody
[2452.20s -> 2454.76s]  tell them. Wait. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[2465.37s -> 2474.74s]  Oh. All right. Okay. So you said hold. So let's get it in the right hand. Alter. Wait for the
[2474.74s -> 2510.36s]  audio cue. Here we go. Ready? No. Stop. Stop. Give me this. Give me the other rock. Okay. I'm. Here
[2510.36s -> 2519.91s]  we go. Do I have things in my hands? Okay. Switch hands. Alter. Let's go. Listen for the cue.
[2520.87s -> 2542.36s]  Okay. It's like a camera sound. Okay. Am I making like a spear or a knife or a weapon?
[2543.16s -> 2556.25s]  Okay. I've got it. I've got something. Now what do I do with this? Switch hands. Can I just
[2556.97s -> 2572.06s]  hit somebody with this? Is it not? It's a sword now. Okay. Inspect it. Okay. It's a sword. Here.
[2572.06s -> 2579.96s]  You can have this. Let's trade. I'll trade you a stick for a rock. Thank you. I've got two rocks.
[2580.60s -> 2607.37s]  Discovered new alteration. Hitting. A granite rock can alter a granite rock. Wow. That's real
[2607.37s -> 2624.46s]  scientific. No. Look at the other ones. Switch hands. Stare at that. Take that in. Yeah. It's
[2624.46s -> 2636.46s]  new. It's a new experience. New tool. Granite grinder. Okay. I've got a grinder. So let me drop
[2637.66s -> 2647.77s]  the... No. Where's the grinder? Okay. I've got the grinder in my hand. Now let's grind.
[2650.70s -> 2677.88s]  Something over here. Should I grind this? All right. I'm gonna grind this. It's not burning.
[2677.88s -> 2686.86s]  Oh, wait. Okay. What if I put it over here? Construction. Some items can lead to construction
[2686.86s -> 2700.62s]  possibilities when in a stockpile. All right. Hold on. No. No. No. Let's get some more leaves.
[2702.10s -> 2720.42s]  Everybody. Grab a leaf. Grab one of these. Okay. Let's put it down. All right. We're starting to
[2720.42s -> 2755.11s]  build a house. Should I grind this? No. That's not gonna work. Give me that rock. I need that rock
[2755.11s -> 2761.00s]  back. Here. I'm gonna put this over here. This is our... Give me another rock. This is a bigger rock.
[2761.00s -> 2774.66s]  Okay. Give me a stick again. What's going on here? What's going on? Why are they holding their
[2774.66s -> 2792.50s]  throats? Okay. This is scent. Okay. Let's go. This is a new rock. Okay. This is obsidian. Wait.
[2793.22s -> 2808.60s]  Obsidian and... This is flammable, isn't it? This is my grinder. I've got obsidian. Here we go.
[2812.14s -> 2829.03s]  Is this gonna explode in my hands? Shit. Wait. Can I take... Where's my obsidian? Okay. Give me
[2829.03s -> 2835.59s]  the obsidian. Remember, that's my grinding stone. All right. Give me the stick. I'm gonna put the...
[2836.23s -> 2855.34s]  I'm gonna put the obsidian on the stick. I think. Obsidian is volcanic glass. Yeah. I'm gonna
[2855.34s -> 2863.67s]  attach it to the front and I'm gonna throw it through the jungle at somebody. Why did I
[2863.67s -> 2876.66s]  just do that? Oh shit. It's getting late. All I've done is hit stuff with rocks. Hitting. An obsidian
[2876.66s -> 2892.57s]  can alter a dead branch. Shit. We gotta go to bed. Wait. Let me look at this. Was it... I don't
[2892.57s -> 2899.93s]  understand 2100. Stick. Okay. Just leave that there for tomorrow. You just hang out. All right.
[2899.93s -> 2914.76s]  Let's go to bed. All right. Good night. I learned some new stuff. Assign to initiate how dexterity
[2914.76s -> 2931.06s]  will improve. Ooh. EU has an increased capacity to metabolize food. Let's get it. Item manipulation.
[2931.06s -> 2935.61s]  The ability to switch an item from one hand to the other while moving is acquired. So I can...
[2936.33s -> 2946.18s]  That's... Who cares? I can switch hands while moving. That's... Who gives a shit? Well,
[2946.18s -> 2962.17s]  we can keep going. Now what? Once connected, it would be possible to drop an item while moving.
[2962.17s -> 2971.64s]  All right. Well, connect it. What are you doing? Why? You can't go that far? Why can't... I don't
[2971.64s -> 2979.88s]  have enough brain power. Okay. Well, I can do things while moving now. I think that's all I
[2979.88s -> 2987.21s]  can do. All right. Let's sleep. Everybody go to bed. Good night. We have to... We gotta move to a new
[2987.21s -> 3000.74s]  settlement, right? There's only day three. Oh. We're learning how to stand... How to rest.
[3002.01s -> 3010.12s]  How to... We're doing charades. Okay. Sleeping. Tired. I need... Especially... I need... Wait,
[3010.12s -> 3016.60s]  wait, wait. Okay. Here, here, here. Stuff, stuff, stuff. Water. Really? There's water right here.
[3016.60s -> 3026.82s]  Why is everybody so fucking thirsty? Everybody over here. He's holding a stick. Have you figured
[3026.82s -> 3039.88s]  out what to do with the stick yet? I don't know what to do. You need to drink the water. This is
[3039.88s -> 3050.70s]  not drinking water, is it? He's gonna become the alpha. No, he's not. I'll do some diabolical
[3050.70s -> 3054.06s]  villain shit where if it looks like he's starting to pass me, I'll just fucking put... I'll just,
[3054.06s -> 3073.18s]  I'll just like cut his vineys on when he's swinging around. Yeah, so that's fucking diabolical.
[3073.18s -> 3083.18s]  Let me go. I'm gonna go explore. Are we well fed? I think we are. He's figuring... Uh-oh. I think I...
[3083.18s -> 3089.35s]  No, no, no. I think here's what happened. I handed him that stick yesterday and he still doesn't know
[3089.35s -> 3094.39s]  what to do with it. Let me show him. Look. Ready? Look at me. Look, look, look, look at me. Look at
[3094.39s -> 3101.35s]  my eyes. Look at me. Get a rock. You got a stick too? They're all, they're all holding sticks. All
[3101.35s -> 3116.74s]  right. We need rocks. What's this? Just hold on. I know, I know what I'm doing. I'm the fucking alpha.
[3117.46s -> 3136.18s]  We need a rock. Where's the rock? Did you guys hoard the rocks? All right. I'm going for it.
[3136.18s -> 3144.95s]  Let's go. What do we got? We have some points of interest. Nothing too... No, no, no. You know what?
[3144.95s -> 3152.92s]  I'm gonna do this first. It's focusing on this. What is that? Okay. That's just grass. I don't
[3152.92s -> 3161.80s]  even know that. What about over here? It's just grass. Don't need to memorize it. That's the same
[3161.80s -> 3169.24s]  shit we had already. Anything else? There's water? What about down here? What's that? I don't know
[3169.24s -> 3189.21s]  what that is. We're gonna find out. What is it? Look at it. Scoop. No, no, no. Look. I want you
[3189.21s -> 3200.73s]  to look at the patches. Phylactery Lich just gave 50 dollars. Thank you for the 50 bucks Phylactery.
[3201.61s -> 3205.29s]  I can't wait for Jerma to extinct the human rice by shoving every food he finds directly in his
[3205.29s -> 3218.76s]  mouth. I'm not gonna do that. Don't worry. How do I look at this? How do I examine it? But thanks
[3218.76s -> 3224.57s]  to the 50 fucking dollars dude, seriously. On top of the insane amount of money we've already given.
[3226.04s -> 3237.37s]  Don't fall. What's that? What was that? Do I need, I need to like hit this with something? All right.
[3237.37s -> 3241.21s]  Don't fall down the waterfall. To like, you know, laugh out loud he fell down the waterfall. I'm
[3241.21s -> 3246.63s]  not gonna do that. Let's look at this one more time. They throw, they throw any branches. Yeah,
[3246.63s -> 3258.74s]  well they're on the mini map. Okay. I'm going over here. Memorize it. Remember it. Pay attention to
[3258.74s -> 3265.94s]  it. How do you climb? It's probably, it's important for me to know how to climb. Because it was on
[3265.94s -> 3271.70s]  the screen for five seconds and it was off. All right, so movement. Swinging and jumping. Stop
[3271.70s -> 3278.42s]  moving left stick before releasing A to cancel a jump. Left stick to swing. Hold A to prime a jump.
[3278.42s -> 3283.26s]  Release A to jump. Jump then hold A to grab foliage or the creepers when passing through it.
[3283.26s -> 3295.90s]  So you just hold A and then you let go of the left stick and you let go of A. I, yes. I'm not
[3295.90s -> 3301.66s]  gonna go this way. Everyone expects me to do the thing where oh the streamer fucking fell down the
[3301.66s -> 3310.49s]  waterfall and I laughed and it was not funny. Not today. Today we're going exploring. This is
[3310.49s -> 3338.57s]  sound. No, this is smell. Something stinks over there. Let me take a look. Oh my god. Okay. Oh my
[3338.57s -> 3348.54s]  god. Okay, we're fine. He fell down. All right, I gotta be careful. Let me see if there's anything
[3348.54s -> 3357.50s]  out here. Hold on. Be careful. There's some smelly things over here. We're hearing something going
[3357.50s -> 3373.59s]  on on the right side. I hear something over there. There are some sounds. Rock. New rock or the same?
[3382.66s -> 3387.06s]  Okay, should I carry the rock in my hand? Okay, I'm gonna smash somebody's head with a rock if I see
[3387.06s -> 3405.64s]  anybody. Gotta head that way. What's going on? What's wrong with me? What is that? Oh, those are,
[3405.64s -> 3410.31s]  those are my, those are my plants. Something can see me? I don't know what can see me right now.
[3410.31s -> 3435.22s]  This is freaking me out. Smell. What do I smell? There ain't nothing here. That's a rival? Is that
[3435.22s -> 3440.90s]  a rival monkey? I don't think it is. I think that's one of my friends, isn't it? He does have a stick
[3440.90s -> 3461.85s]  in his hand. This is my friend, right? There's a snake. Where? Where is there a snake? I don't see
[3461.85s -> 3482.58s]  a snake. All right, communication upgraded. I don't, there's no snake. We're fine. All right,
[3482.58s -> 3490.38s]  everybody come with me. Follow me, guys. We need to get over there. And there's berries over here.
[3491.18s -> 3505.62s]  I'm a professional. Don't fuck around. All right, there it is. Berries. Is it, is it berries?
[3506.34s -> 3517.69s]  That was fucking close. All right, we're almost there.
[3521.03s -> 3527.06s]  I need to get some vantage so I can take a look around. There's a new tree up here or something.
[3527.78s -> 3538.79s]  This is new. All right, guys. New. Everybody up. Take it. Smell it. Get it in your hands.
[3539.93s -> 3556.42s]  Alert. Alert. Alert. Alert. Why is there an alert? It's a pig. Oh shit. Somebody get a rock.
[3557.14s -> 3566.33s]  Does anybody have a rock? I do. No, give me the rock. Do I have the rock?
[3569.32s -> 3580.49s]  Okay, I got a rock. Where'd he go? Here. I think we're okay. I need to examine
[3580.49s -> 3595.85s]  this shit though. This is something new. Is it edible? New food. Caught. Eat it. Wait,
[3595.85s -> 3618.90s]  no, no, no. No, you got, don't eat it yet. Let me test it. Is it good? All right, we've all eaten.
[3618.90s -> 3645.10s]  Should I chop the tree down? Oh, no, you guys don't eat it all. Okay, analyze. I now know what that
[3645.10s -> 3652.33s]  looks like. Let's stand still. Let's smell. No, we got, that's where I want to go. Let's smell,
[3652.33s -> 3660.31s]  though. Let's just make sure. Not missing anything. Listening for something too.
[3661.11s -> 3665.34s]  Oh, I can hear you guys. Stop screaming. All right, we're good. Maybe one more for the road.
[3668.25s -> 3675.42s]  Kill the pig. We don't know how to use weapons. I can barely teach these guys how to throw a rock.
[3675.42s -> 3682.84s]  I don't know anything else. No, the mission is still the same. Get to this question mark. Identify
[3682.84s -> 3687.96s]  it. Memorize it. Get over there. There's something over there we need to investigate on. All right,
[3687.96s -> 3713.85s]  easy. Here we go. Hello? Is that guy on my team? I don't get it. All right, this is where the baby
[3713.85s -> 3720.52s]  was. Anything else we need to see over here? Oh, wait. Might as well take a look at it. Get
[3720.52s -> 3751.78s]  it in your brain. This is a hiding place. What? Hello? Is it above us? Where is it? Is it over
[3751.78s -> 3774.82s]  there? Where is this thing? Whatever it is, it's that way. What is it? Is it a snake?
[3774.82s -> 3799.05s]  Oh, it's a snake. Oh, shoot. Kill it. Kill the snake.
[3801.13s -> 3808.70s]  Fight it. Uh-oh. Hold A to prime dodging. Move left stick to choose direction. Release at the
[3808.70s -> 3830.25s]  right time. Okay. I'm poisoned. Drink water. Intimidate. Why did I chase it? I don't know
[3830.25s -> 3845.43s]  because I figured we were all gonna fucking stop them. Drink it. Drink the water. Drink the water.
[3845.43s -> 3856.84s]  Please. Drink the water. Oh, God. I need a healing plant. Somebody help, please. Medicinal? What's
[3856.84s -> 3873.62s]  that? Hiding spot. No. I need a medicinal plant. I don't know what's over there, but let's find out.
[3874.34s -> 3898.63s]  Hurry up. All right. What's this? Is this wheat? It's wheat. New gathering spot. Fishing spot.
[3899.77s -> 3910.94s]  No, I'm still poisoned. What like heals poison? What? What? Huh? Fear of the unknown. Use your
[3910.94s -> 3916.42s]  senses and intelligence to identify what's around you. Fear and dopamine is needed to...
[3916.42s -> 3934.79s]  Dopamine is needed to avoid hysteria when in fear. Oh, fuck. It's another snake. Is that the same
[3934.79s -> 3952.49s]  snake? Everybody get over here. Strength in numbers. Give me that thing. All right. I need...
[3953.45s -> 3964.44s]  Snake still here? All right. I'm out. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Climb. Climb. Climb. Climb.
[3964.44s -> 3967.48s]  Don't. Just don't. No, no, no, no. Get it. Just get... What the fuck is that?
[3969.40s -> 3981.75s]  What? I thought it was a snake. Oh, my God. It's a lion. Get out of the way. Get up on the tree.
[3982.87s -> 3987.19s]  Climb. Oh, he's looking at me. Why is he looking at me? Why is he looking at me? Why is he looking
[3987.19s -> 3999.74s]  at me? Why is he looking at me? Get up here. He can't climb. Okay. What am I supposed to do?
[4001.03s -> 4009.46s]  He can't get up there. It's like the three stooges. He can't get up. He can't get up. He
[4009.46s -> 4016.36s]  can't get up. Come on. All the way up. What's wrong with me? Why? Where am I going?
[4021.06s -> 4024.42s]  I'm not in control. I'm not in control.
[4036.17s -> 4061.77s]  Did I just knock myself out? I have no idea. Am I still poisoned? What happened?
[4067.85s -> 4085.90s]  I put my head so hard that I cured the poison. What is in my hand? New food? A giant African snail.
[4090.58s -> 4110.07s]  When did I pick up a snail? Nutrients from the mollusk kind of food. I'm still poisoned.
[4110.87s -> 4125.24s]  Dammit. All right. I need to fight. I need to learn how to fight. I need to lie down first,
[4125.24s -> 4143.22s]  I think. How did I even get back here? I need to lie down. I'm gonna sleep off the poison.
[4143.22s -> 4158.84s]  I'm good. You died? This is a different monkey. Why is this one? Wait, did we all get bit by the
[4158.84s -> 4164.84s]  snake or something? Wait, this is a different... This is different. Wait a minute. Hold on. Is
[4164.84s -> 4186.54s]  this still you? Who's on me? Wait, this is not me? Partnered with Book. Oh, okay. I can't even,
[4186.54s -> 4196.54s]  man. I need to learn some new abilities. There we are. All right. You're supposed to just die
[4196.54s -> 4201.83s]  because there's no way you can survive. All right. Handling. What about what just opened up down
[4201.83s -> 4209.24s]  here? More communication. Self-empowerment. Once connected, clan members will have the capacity
[4209.24s -> 4215.16s]  to automatically mimic an intimidation or the action of conquering fear. Get down there.
[4216.60s -> 4228.44s]  I need you guys to be independent. Good. All right. What about this generation? The past
[4228.44s -> 4231.80s]  generation was being an adult, being your clan's active settlement, and the clan must have at
[4231.80s -> 4244.34s]  least one kid. Okay, so we need... We got more shit here to do. So this is generational. Switch
[4244.34s -> 4248.90s]  an item from... So this means that new... Wait, does this person not know how to do anything?
[4256.50s -> 4275.78s]  Shit. Okay. Generational. Item manipulation. So what about... This is reinforce. So the new
[4276.82s -> 4282.47s]  monkeys will know that. So this is ensuring that the next generation will know. Okay.
[4283.35s -> 4290.22s]  This... I mean, that's fairly important, I think. All right. Let's go. I need to go... We need to
[4290.22s -> 4295.30s]  go to sleep. This time, I ain't gonna do anything till I fucking learn how to make like a weapon.
[4311.54s -> 4317.45s]  Why am I having a dream of the hyenas? All right. It's 8 a.m. Let's go.
[4318.79s -> 4329.03s]  We're good. Sleep, food, water. Everyone's healthy. Let's get this going. I was on an
[4329.03s -> 4338.78s]  expedition. We're not gonna do... It's too dangerous. Where is my stuff? I have like a rock over here.
[4338.78s -> 4344.71s]  This is... It was my grinding rock. Let me... I'm gonna build a little thing first. Here's a rock.
[4345.43s -> 4361.18s]  Give me a stick. Stick of some sort. Something like that. Here we go. Drop the babies. I get
[4361.18s -> 4382.15s]  extra points if I have a baby with me. Let's alter it. What the hell? Shit. I missed the
[4382.15s -> 4400.18s]  opportunity. Hold on. Alter it. New stripping. Okay. Now a grass can be modified. All right.
[4400.18s -> 4407.38s]  Now let's take a look at that. What do you think about this? Is it... Can I hit somebody with this
[4407.38s -> 4423.42s]  thing maybe? Okay. Stem. Stem and... I don't know. Just eat it. Enchant it. Now can I do something
[4423.42s -> 4448.44s]  with the rock? No. You made a butt scratcher. That's not gonna do anything. I need the... I need
[4448.44s -> 4460.74s]  like leaves. I need... Give me... I need a... Come here. Put my stuff over here. I need one of those
[4460.74s -> 4472.26s]  sticks. Give me the rock. I'm gonna make a stick and then I'm gonna take the stone and I'm gonna
[4472.26s -> 4485.78s]  make something else with it. Smash it up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't throw it. Don't. I had to
[4485.78s -> 4499.72s]  let go and it's gone. That was obsidian. I don't know where it is now. Okay. So there we go. I don't
[4499.72s -> 4507.29s]  even need the rock anymore. Well, I do now. Okay. So you can just strip it. Now what happens if I
[4507.29s -> 4521.56s]  take an obsidian rock and I smash them together? I'm sharpening the end. Just learned how to make
[4521.56s -> 4552.09s]  a weapon and I'm gonna make like... What happened? Who died? Okay. Well, I don't know. It just
[4552.09s -> 4580.70s]  happened. Come on. Come on. Keep it going. New alteration. An obsidian can alter a stick.
[4581.50s -> 4589.37s]  And now this stick can be used. Use the obsidian as a tool at least twice. Switch up the hands.
[4589.37s -> 4606.20s]  Take a look at the weapon and learn. Pointy means pain. Ow. Sharp. Blood. Sharpened stick. Good.
[4606.20s -> 4614.14s]  I now have a weapon. I am ready. I am gonna actually give this to you.
[4615.18s -> 4629.86s]  Come here. I want you to take this. Learn. Take that. Why is everybody choking?
[4630.66s -> 4638.10s]  Here. Take this item. Good. Now you have the pointy stick and we're gonna make like three of these.
[4638.66s -> 4659.35s]  He's dying. He's not dying. Oh, I'm eating bugs. What happens when I get this to level two?
[4663.26s -> 4677.13s]  All right. Couple. Couple? Should we make some more children? Wow. I have two kids. There's two kids
[4677.13s -> 4690.17s]  on me. Okay. Ig. Coupled with Ku. All right. Good. Make sure you take that stick with you.
[4692.38s -> 4705.91s]  You're gonna be fine. Stop like... What are you choking on? Analyze. Yeah, you're fine. All right.
[4705.91s -> 4721.51s]  We're gonna make babies. You and I. Here. Eat this. Eat it.
[4723.43s -> 4728.49s]  Well, never mind. Here. Somebody else eat this. All right. Now it's time. I'm gonna make a couple
[4728.49s -> 4735.94s]  more sticks. We need to have some... some form of defense. I'm not gonna walk around the jungle
[4735.94s -> 4759.43s]  without anything. It's that. Grab the rock. Let's make another sharp stick. Do the rock and obsidian
[4759.43s -> 4767.82s]  next. You don't know how to use them. Can I just like stab somebody with this so we know what happens?
[4768.78s -> 4778.28s]  Like I can't just walk into somebody with this and just stab them through like the chest.
[4780.12s -> 4789.10s]  And everyone would be like... and they'll know that it's... that it does that. Oh my god. I'm a
[4789.10s -> 4825.05s]  fucking idiot. I'm gonna put this down. Water. Why am I afraid of the water? Does phobia get passed
[4825.05s -> 4855.34s]  down from generation to generation in this game? I'm good. Got a stick. Put this down. Now put the
[4855.34s -> 4864.17s]  stick down because I need to drink water. All right. Everybody get over here. Water, guys.
[4865.05s -> 4880.68s]  Everybody in. Look what I'm doing. Do what I'm doing. Why you have to... food, water,
[4881.56s -> 4892.52s]  didn't we learn this already? Everybody in the water. Follow me in here. In the water.
[4894.04s -> 4910.09s]  In the water. You can do it. Very good. All of you now. I know I'm gonna move because you're
[4910.09s -> 4925.21s]  not gonna do it. In here. Get in the water. Why won't he come in the water? Look. Okay.
[4925.85s -> 4932.20s]  Do I need to teach you everything? Yes, apparently I do. Do we even have any more food?
[4933.94s -> 4945.37s]  Stab him. No. I need to... okay. I need... where's my food? Where's food? Hold on. He's like...
[4945.37s -> 4966.49s]  is food over here, right? Right here. Come here. Everybody over here right now. I'm going blind?
[4966.49s -> 4999.82s]  What? Eat it. Good job. Finally. Can we drink in here now? Good. I can't... I cannot have...
[4999.82s -> 5011.34s]  I can't have sex right now, guys. All right. You got a stick. I got a stick. That should be good.
[5011.34s -> 5023.37s]  Everyone's eaten. Everyone's drank. Let's go. Where's my stick? There it is. Give me my stick.
[5027.38s -> 5031.06s]  I don't know how to use it, but I might be able to like accidentally hit something with this. All
[5031.06s -> 5039.26s]  right. Let's try this again. I want to go somewhere close. I don't know what... I don't know what this
[5039.26s -> 5043.10s]  is, but I... wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I hit it? I think I
[5043.10s -> 5055.58s]  can hit this with a stick. Let me try. Use the stick on here. Come on. Come on. You know you want
[5055.58s -> 5068.39s]  to do it. Swing on... swing the stick. Ow. Damn it. I thought I could just whack it. I can't hit.
[5073.02s -> 5091.54s]  Damn it. All right. We need to go to bed. Try to hit a tree. Let me see if I have any more evolution
[5091.54s -> 5102.86s]  points. I do want to do this. See if I can reach it. Is there enough points? Yes, there is. Thank
[5102.86s -> 5113.70s]  God. You can drop an item while moving as acquired. Good. Now that opened up something over here.
[5113.70s -> 5122.02s]  Need more dexterity. Motor skills. Growth potential for reflexes. More training is needed.
[5123.59s -> 5129.22s]  Motor skills. Potential ability to build. I have to like just bring trees and branches and
[5129.22s -> 5137.75s]  shit over there. All right. Lie down. Sleep. I'm getting up at 5 a.m. and we're going out.
[5146.46s -> 5149.74s]  Put down the children. The children give me bonus points.
[5150.46s -> 5161.48s]  The ability to breathe while walking has been unlocked.
[5162.28s -> 5166.28s]  Oh yeah. Something like that. Somebody else is dead. How are there people dying?
[5167.08s -> 5173.86s]  Are those people that are still out in the wild? Okay. I've got my... we got two spears.
[5176.10s -> 5192.60s]  It's you. How did you die? Why are we just dropping like flies? I don't understand.
[5198.63s -> 5203.75s]  Analyzing the corpse of a friend generates energy as for other actions. Use it for evolution while
[5203.75s -> 5208.63s]  resting on it. Okay. I just got points for looking at it. Dead for zero years. How do I
[5208.63s -> 5226.68s]  like get rid of them? This is gonna attract predators. All right. I'm doing something else.
[5227.74s -> 5244.62s]  Everybody over here. Eat. Come here. Everybody eat. Everybody drink. Use corpses of training.
[5244.62s -> 5257.45s]  Tell me that's not gonna work. You need to survive. We need to eat. We need meat to survive. We don't
[5257.45s -> 5262.98s]  need to eat meat to survive. The real question I have is why can I not break this stuff? We've
[5262.98s -> 5274.09s]  eaten all the stuff over here. We need more food. This settlement is done. We've eaten everything
[5274.09s -> 5296.57s]  here. Follow my lead. I need building points. Hold on. Do what I do. Pick. Do what I do. Drop.
[5297.53s -> 5312.10s]  Right over here. You can do it. No, no, no. Hold on. And then I'm gonna burn this. Okay. Start
[5312.10s -> 5334.41s]  construction. Oh. I just figured it out. Various construction can improve your settlement.
[5335.21s -> 5349.30s]  There you go. I just did it. All right. I deserve some water for that one. I got my weapon.
[5351.74s -> 5355.58s]  I am going to go. We need to find some more food or something.
[5356.54s -> 5373.30s]  What is that? Let's go take a look. Can I? I can't hit this. No. I can't break it.
[5373.86s -> 5380.18s]  Even with a stick. I don't. My butt. Ow. My like brain doesn't understand. I'm gonna climb up here.
[5384.78s -> 5400.41s]  What have we got up here? Anything new? Yeah. Looks like it. All right. I'm gonna get this.
[5402.23s -> 5416.81s]  No snakes and shit, right? What is this? New stuff? What is that? What is this? Food. Found
[5416.81s -> 5447.72s]  the food tree. Eat up. No. I need to get. What the hell do I need? Nothing there. Are you eating?
[5450.76s -> 5455.77s]  Smell. Anything smell? That's something down there smells.
[5456.17s -> 5463.46s]  I'm going that way. Can I inspect it? I think I've already inspected this I think.
[5464.71s -> 5468.95s]  Where's the other clan members? Especially where's the one with the spear?
[5469.99s -> 5481.46s]  No. You're down there. Okay. Let's go. I'm gonna be careful this time.
[5485.93s -> 5490.20s]  I don't. I really don't want to fuck this up. I need to discover something.
[5494.25s -> 5506.39s]  Smell. Up top. Any apples? What's over there? I get something that way.
[5507.35s -> 5510.07s]  In there. There's something smells. I'm staying in the up up in the trees.
[5511.03s -> 5515.90s]  I ain't gonna get fucking killed up there. I learned new intimidation techniques.
[5516.70s -> 5526.36s]  Got a pit stop right here. Easy. You got a stick? All right. We both got sticks.
[5527.16s -> 5538.02s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. I'm fine. That was just barely not enough to get hurt.
[5538.66s -> 5549.58s]  What is that? Oh, a new thing. No, that's I know what that is. A hiding spot. Okay. I know what
[5549.66s -> 5564.22s]  that is. Another hiding spot. Don't know what that is. Let's check that out first. Memorize that.
[5564.22s -> 5573.40s]  Remember it. Burn it in your brain. Let's go. Okay, let's make our way down here. I'm gonna go up.
[5575.75s -> 5588.73s]  Can I climb this? Climb the moss over here, right? You can do that. How can you not do that?
[5594.74s -> 5614.65s]  Got it. This way. Have you seen this before? Is this new? I don't think this is new.
[5617.69s -> 5621.11s]  No, it's not. Just want to make sure this is not something new.
[5624.25s -> 5635.45s]  Nope, but it smells good. Eat it. Get over here. Get over here. Come on.
[5640.38s -> 5646.90s]  Well, I'm trying. I can't. Whatever. Let's go. Where was the thing that I wanted to inspect over
[5646.90s -> 5658.46s]  here? Oh, it was down here. Okay, right there. Granite rock. Granite rock. Don't need that.
[5659.26s -> 5668.87s]  What is that? Unknown. It looks like there's predator faces over there, though.
[5669.59s -> 5687.06s]  Is that a snake or something? More food. Are those mine? Are those my monkey friends?
[5688.71s -> 5692.06s]  Yeah, they are. Okay. I'm going over there. Is it a beehive?
[5692.78s -> 5711.94s]  Somebody's choking. What's that? Do you hear that? Who's choking?
[5711.94s -> 5738.06s]  I don't know who's choking. That is a beehive. I'm gonna get the honey. I gotta go. I gotta go.
[5738.06s -> 5760.07s]  Gotta go. Gotta go. Found it. It's right here. Why is somebody choking? I got it. What is it?
[5762.18s -> 5791.45s]  How do I take it? Okay, I gotta let go of this. Somebody is still choking. I don't know why. I
[5791.45s -> 5797.83s]  died. Donut. Okay, I got my right hand is free. Here we go. Grab. Should I grab the beehive?
[5804.18s -> 5830.76s]  It's bees? Kapok fiber. What do I do with this? All right. Who is that? What do I do with this?
[5831.40s -> 5856.22s]  All right, easy. Smash it. Apply. It's like soap. Okay, I learned how to bathe with like a
[5856.22s -> 5863.50s]  fucking beehive. What's next? Find a new spot that we haven't seen. There is a snake over there.
[5864.30s -> 5867.67s]  I am fucking around. This is what I wanted to look at. What's over here?
[5868.55s -> 5876.46s]  Okay, we know what those do. Let's get some drink while we have a minute.
[5878.01s -> 5882.41s]  Food. There's a snake over here. There's a snake over here somewhere. Wait, where's the snake?
[5882.41s -> 5893.85s]  I'm not gonna fucking die again. Where is it? Giant warthog. Where is there a giant warthog?
[5894.65s -> 5905.02s]  We work together. Got it. Intimidated the warthog. We have sticks and shit. I would be scared too,
[5905.02s -> 5916.87s]  wouldn't you? I don't even know where they were. He saw the stick. All right, now let's go back
[5916.87s -> 5923.58s]  down here. Let's make sure there's nothing here. I don't see anything. What about here? I'm gonna
[5925.94s -> 5946.52s]  know. Let's eat. All right, good. Let's eat. Let's drink some water on our voyage.
[5947.24s -> 5957.34s]  I need to put the stick down. I don't like that though. Maybe I should give the stick
[5957.34s -> 5980.30s]  to somebody else. Come on in and drink. He's drinking mud water. Give that person the stick.
[5985.67s -> 5990.39s]  I'm using my two children. No, I'm not. Then I'm not using like the kids' armor.
[5991.43s -> 6004.74s]  I'm getting extra points for being here. What? What is it? What is it? What is it? Snake, snake,
[6004.74s -> 6021.82s]  snake, snake, snake. Intimidate. Together. Should I go to stab the snake? Nope. Intimidate. Let's go.
[6021.82s -> 6038.95s]  Together. That's right. Fuck off. All right, now throw javelin style into the snake. That's right.
[6038.95s -> 6044.18s]  We got two sticks and our crew. You don't want to fuck with us. All right, what we got? We got some
[6044.18s -> 6047.54s]  new stuff over here. This is different. I don't think I know what this is. This is a new item.
[6048.42s -> 6083.08s]  Let's check it out. Is it? What's going on? Why can I not inspect? Fishing spot. Huh? Oh shit.
[6083.80s -> 6092.65s]  Did I get one? I got one. Spear fishing. You found a way to get food in a fishing spot.
[6093.29s -> 6106.14s]  Is it? What is it? It's a lobster. Nice. All right. Do we need to cook food? Did our ancestors
[6106.14s -> 6116.28s]  cook food? I think they just ate anything they found on the ground. What the hell? Oh god. What
[6116.28s -> 6137.91s]  do I do? Why is it? Are we just watching like a match? Where did that happen? He just kind of ran
[6137.91s -> 6146.60s]  over. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to put down my like crawfish weapon. Somebody just puked.
[6147.16s -> 6159.56s]  Who just puked? How do I eat this? No, how do I eat the crawfish? How do I eat it?
[6168.15s -> 6181.80s]  I want to eat the fish. Oh, whatever. Okay, let's go. I think that was over here.
[6181.80s -> 6185.48s]  Yeah, there's all kinds of fucked up shit going on over here. Relax, everybody. Hold on.
[6186.36s -> 6191.45s]  Don't get too crazy up here. Okay, there he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he is.
[6191.45s -> 6194.41s]  What do we do? What do we do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[6194.41s -> 6201.99s]  about this. Should we scream at him? Should we run? I think we've run. No, no, no, don't fight.
[6201.99s -> 6218.07s]  Intimidate. Yeah, we got sticks. It's fine. Good. The sticks really do help. He's right there.
[6224.73s -> 6239.86s]  Get out of here. Run away. I want to get over there. He's going to try to wrap around.
[6241.69s -> 6261.96s]  Inspect the stick. I can't take it off. All right, watch out. Away from the pig.
[6262.04s -> 6272.62s]  Can we sleep up in a tree? Up here, follow me. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where
[6272.62s -> 6279.08s]  are you going? Come on. Don't be the one that's left behind. Where's the number three? Number
[6279.08s -> 6288.31s]  four. All right, we got four, right? I'm too stupid to grab with the other hand. What's wrong?
[6288.31s -> 6313.72s]  Am I getting gas? Am I getting gas for andrological problems? That just gave me a stomach ache.
[6314.52s -> 6323.14s]  Should I not have eaten that? I need a place to sleep. We need to go over there. All right,
[6324.63s -> 6345.34s]  we need to go over there. All right, let's go. What is it? There's something over there.
[6346.22s -> 6356.22s]  Question mark. I got to get up top. We need to find a place to hang out before it gets too late.
[6356.22s -> 6371.66s]  I need to sleep. Holy shit. That would have been so fucking horrible. Okay, I'm almost at the
[6372.62s -> 6378.14s]  unmemorized item has been forgotten. It's been forgotten. How does that make any sense?
[6378.30s -> 6385.78s]  All right. I found the thing that I'm... Why is there a ticking like,
[6385.78s -> 6409.10s]  bomb sound? No. All right, let's make camp over here. No, we don't. No, we don't. Don't make camp
[6409.10s -> 6414.79s]  over here. Don't make camp. Don't make camp over here. Don't make camp. All right, we can get up
[6414.79s -> 6420.07s]  here. I don't know what it is. I don't know where I'm looking at. I hear something. This is
[6420.07s -> 6433.18s]  alligators. Alligators. Jesus Christ. Get up. I don't know what to do. Hurry up and get up here.
[6433.18s -> 6455.21s]  He's trying to surprise. Let's help. What do we do? Should I stab? Go. He was trying to hold
[6455.21s -> 6460.23s]  his mouth closed. Where's the thing I need to get? It's over... Where is it? Over here?
[6461.03s -> 6467.54s]  This is not the appropriate music for what's happening right now. This is like Dora the
[6467.62s -> 6482.73s]  Explorer music. I lost my stick. Why did they want me to come over here? I need to get up high,
[6482.73s -> 6485.93s]  and then what's the thing I need to examine for my future generations to know what it is?
[6488.22s -> 6512.95s]  Where is it? Is it up there? I don't even fucking understand what the hell this wants me to do.
[6515.37s -> 6524.52s]  All right. I'm dying. How do I stop bleeding? How do I fix my bone? How do I fix my bones?
[6525.16s -> 6530.20s]  I don't know how to fix them. I don't have no idea. I think you're alive still. Okay, you need
[6530.20s -> 6536.04s]  to take... You're gonna take... You're gonna take everybody. Here, take... Take the kids. Take the
[6536.04s -> 6542.74s]  kids. Take the kids. Take the kids. How do I put the kids down? Take the kids. No, take the kids.
[6542.74s -> 6566.49s]  Forget about this stuff. Take the kids. I need to eat something and just sit. Good luck. There's a
[6566.49s -> 6586.60s]  hiding spot over there. There's a crocodile right below me. Oh, he's dead. I couldn't even hand off
[6586.60s -> 6606.52s]  the kids. Here we go again. Okay, what are you gonna do now? He's just... He's following me up.
[6606.52s -> 6611.32s]  He's like, slow down. Wait, wait, wait. It's not worth it. You don't have to be great.
[6611.32s -> 6627.37s]  Just hold on a minute here. I think... I think we're still alive. We got to the top of the tree and
[6627.37s -> 6645.27s]  then we somehow made it home. I don't know how. Okay, well, let's lie down. We've unlocked some
[6645.27s -> 6654.15s]  new things, apparently. A cognitive enhancement. Once connected, it would be possible to detect
[6654.15s -> 6662.79s]  more distant elements through the intelligence. Okay. The ability to detect more distant elements
[6662.79s -> 6666.79s]  through intelligence is acquired. Tap Y to use your intelligence and follow the steps proposed
[6666.79s -> 6676.04s]  by the contextual actions. Did I unlock anything over here? EU has an increased capacity to
[6676.04s -> 6685.00s]  metabolize food, but is EU even still alive? All right, let's lock in a couple more of these.
[6691.77s -> 6703.50s]  Lock that one in and let's lock this one in too. All right, the kids are gonna stay.
[6704.14s -> 6713.69s]  It feels like this game was made without any real premise. Just a bunch of ideas.
[6715.54s -> 6730.39s]  Kind of. I'm good. Water, sleep, food. I don't have any sticks. Who's even left in the plan?
[6731.27s -> 6744.23s]  I've got a couple people here. All right, let me try. Give me rock and give me... What about two
[6744.23s -> 6754.49s]  rocks? Do two of these do anything? Two obsidian rocks. I mean, I just... I think there's something
[6754.49s -> 6772.31s]  here. There's something here to explore. No. Pick it up. Give me the... Pick up the rock.
[6773.03s -> 6784.30s]  Pick up the fucking rock. Give me the rock. Memorize where the rock is and look at it and
[6784.30s -> 6796.49s]  pick it up. No. Is there another one over here? I can do something with this too.
[6797.21s -> 6806.22s]  Pick up the rock. I could have just picked it up. Why can't I pick it up? Give me the rock.
[6807.03s -> 6827.02s]  I just saw it. I just hit A. Fine. Take the other one. This person is so dead. Can I at
[6827.02s -> 6850.06s]  least move this person out of the way? No, I can't pick up the rock because this game suffers from
[6850.06s -> 6871.74s]  so many games that do this. They tie every action to the same button. I'm just gonna make it fun.
[6871.74s -> 6895.90s]  Come here. I did it. Give me a stick. Give me this damn thing. I need another obsidian rock.
[6896.70s -> 6909.26s]  I ain't gonna find one. I have to go looking for a rock. I mean, hold on. Can I do anything
[6909.26s -> 6921.88s]  with these two? I don't think I can. No. Make a gun. I don't think I have the necessary items.
[6922.60s -> 6929.88s]  Can I not look at this yet? I feel like I should be able to examine the briar patch.
[6929.88s -> 6939.21s]  Touch it and go, oh! Anyways, what's over here? What's happening over there? A snake of some sort,
[6939.21s -> 6961.10s]  maybe? Is it a snake? What is going on here? Bugs? Can you eat bugs? Liftable rock. Okay.
[6961.98s -> 6984.74s]  I'm doing it with the stick. Come on. Use your strength. Oh, you idiot. I need a better stick,
[6984.74s -> 6998.12s]  a bigger one, a stronger stick. What do we got over here? More stuff to look at. He's trying his best.
[6998.92s -> 7014.02s]  Well, get up there and look. Look at it. It was just like, oh, what's this thing over here?
[7014.74s -> 7031.51s]  No, he doesn't care. No, you don't care. He still hasn't figured out that you can touch that.
[7039.64s -> 7042.68s]  Anything else over here that I can do? All this shit over there.
[7043.88s -> 7062.38s]  He's learning. I want to lift a rock up so bad. Come on. Liftable rock. I can do it. I just need
[7062.38s -> 7076.44s]  something stronger. Get everybody over here. Everybody, come here. We all might need sticks.
[7077.16s -> 7088.15s]  Let me make a few sticks. I need like a stick tree. That one right there?
[7089.83s -> 7112.82s]  No. Can we use this, though, for something? Are you guys coming? Here. I don't know. We're not
[7112.82s -> 7121.26s]  going to be able to use this for anything, but I'm going to put it over here. Give me a stick,
[7121.26s -> 7129.29s]  a big one. I wasn't doing the rock thing right. I didn't have a prop to do anything. It was his
[7129.29s -> 7139.14s]  whole day. And let go when it makes that sound. I didn't hear a sound. All right, there's a stick.
[7140.12s -> 7150.66s]  That's for you. Come here. Here. You take that stick. We're all going to do this together.
[7151.46s -> 7174.55s]  Come here. You. You take this one. This one's mine. Follow me. We're going to go get the buried
[7174.55s -> 7179.83s]  treasure that's underneath that rock. With me. Let's go. Wait. First, drink on your own because
[7179.83s -> 7204.31s]  you're stupid. Get over here. Drink. Just do what I do. Get in here. You're staring at it. You're
[7204.31s -> 7215.51s]  so thirsty, but you won't drink the water you're standing in. If only there was something cool and
[7215.51s -> 7242.42s]  refreshing. Why are you covered in blood? Get it. Why do they not understand this? How do you not
[7242.42s -> 7267.21s]  understand? Let's go. Follow me. Follow. Let's go. Bring your sticks. You gave them sticks to hold.
[7267.21s -> 7274.81s]  Well, is that my fault that they're that stupid? Everybody together. Let's get this thing up. You
[7274.81s -> 7290.49s]  got your sticks? Good. Together. Over here. Here we go. Help me lift. Bingo. I found mushrooms.
[7297.46s -> 7314.34s]  There it is. Take a look at that. New food. African agaric fungus. Here, you eat this
[7314.98s -> 7320.58s]  because you know who's the one that needs the most food? You. Just watch me eat it.
[7321.46s -> 7332.63s]  I think that means that I have a stomach problem. Here, come try it. We have to get our stomach
[7332.63s -> 7351.77s]  stronger. Try the mushrooms. They're delightful. Anybody else gonna eat one of these? Okay,
[7354.71s -> 7369.14s]  so I know that those are mushrooms. Very cool. There is another spot right there. More mushrooms.
[7369.78s -> 7388.04s]  Here, somebody take one of these. Take this. Here, try it. Look, see? Try it.
[7395.18s -> 7441.78s]  Finally, he's eating it. Do you like it? It's good, huh? I think I think it's drugs. Okay,
[7441.78s -> 7453.06s]  I think. Can we have some children? This is chio adult male coupled with clue.
[7453.78s -> 7464.66s]  Well, let's keep going. I think there's another rock. Yep, there's more stuff over here to inspect.
[7465.90s -> 7481.96s]  What's this? What do we got? Grab. This is a new rock. Oh, this one's marble. Tool. The salt.
[7483.61s -> 7501.19s]  What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? Is it just the drugs?
[7501.91s -> 7523.80s]  It might just be drugs. What about the smells over here? I think we're good.
[7526.30s -> 7536.54s]  No, I don't see anything. All right, let me get this in memory. Why are too many drugs to figure
[7536.54s -> 7547.29s]  this out? There's salt. Salt over here. I need to just record this. Evolution points for that.
[7548.01s -> 7557.21s]  All right, keep going. I thought I freaked out first. I thought that was a giant snake.
[7557.21s -> 7562.89s]  I thought that was the head of a gigantic fucking like pterodactyl snake monster alien
[7563.77s -> 7575.50s]  with big spread out wings. I was about to shit my pants. What's over here? That anything up top?
[7576.22s -> 7580.39s]  I think I want to go to the one back there. This is too dangerous. I'm not high enough level for
[7580.39s -> 7589.58s]  this. Oh, there's that fiber. I probably should grab some of that. Yeah, let's get some of this
[7589.58s -> 7595.43s]  fiber. I'm going to try to combine it with something right hangs on a tree down here.
[7597.51s -> 7599.75s]  Can I do this? Can I? Maybe I can do something with these two things.
[7602.86s -> 7635.03s]  Yep, let's make a spear. Am I hungry or thirsty? I can get the salt can alter a stick. Okay, got it.
[7636.73s -> 7649.98s]  Spin that around. I need to grab the it is a couple over here. Where is it? There's one hanging
[7649.98s -> 7653.90s]  from that tree right there. I need to throw this rock. I don't need it anymore. Just get rid of it.
[7655.72s -> 7668.14s]  And I'm going for right there. I want to use this because I don't want to just rub this on my body.
[7668.14s -> 7673.82s]  I want to put this somewhere else. You know what I mean? I need to craft this into something.
[7673.82s -> 7692.14s]  Maybe I can grind it on the spear. Use it on the bloody clan member. That's actually not a bad idea.
[7692.78s -> 7697.82s]  That's not a bad idea at all. Where are they? Let me see if it's a problem.
[7698.46s -> 7714.65s]  Can I burn it? Maybe I can light it. All right, follow me back to the campsite.
[7715.45s -> 7748.62s]  We are good. What's the dead? What's the dead thing? I know I knew that you were dead.
[7749.58s -> 7755.91s]  Okay, there's the kid. Is there another person dead? I don't think so. All right,
[7755.91s -> 7760.31s]  so let me see. What can I do with this? I have a stick. Let me get a rock. Give me a rock. I'm
[7760.31s -> 7773.21s]  going to hit the rock and fiber together. I want a rock. I would love to pick that obsidian up.
[7773.21s -> 7785.69s]  That's right here. But I can't. This is not possible. So we're going to go over here.
[7788.09s -> 7805.50s]  Here's a rock. All right. Can I smash these two together? So I smashed them. That's not going to
[7805.50s -> 7821.72s]  do anything. Okay, I can stop it. Okay. What about this one? This other rock? This is obsidian,
[7821.72s -> 7845.21s]  right? Can I just eat this? Just crafted by itself? Okay. I can't. I'm missing something.
[7849.26s -> 7860.07s]  Maybe the rock? No, something else. Smash it. Smash it. Smash with rock. Smash with rock.
[7860.07s -> 7865.86s]  No, I need an obsidian rock. Not this one. This rock sucks. I need the obsidian rock.
[7866.82s -> 7872.39s]  And there was two in my bed, but I can no longer get to them. So we're gonna have to find another
[7872.39s -> 7881.72s]  one. I already know what that is. Let's just identify all this shit. This gives me points,
[7881.72s -> 7893.22s]  right? Might as well do it. Sleep spot. Oh, another sleep spot. Dead branch. That's for sticks.
[7894.02s -> 7928.14s]  Another sleep spot. Okay. Hello, baby. Fishing. Oh, there's a fishing spot right here. Obsidian
[7928.22s -> 7938.46s]  rock. I think I found an obsidian rock. Yes. Give me. Here we go. Will this do anything?
[7940.76s -> 7956.63s]  No, it won't. Well, I have an obsidian rock. I wanted this before. Try to sharpen this rock
[7956.63s -> 7962.31s]  with the other rock and then try to hit the sharpening rock on this thing. All right,
[7962.31s -> 7971.56s]  let's try that. Give me a rock. Put this down. God, fucking evolution sucks. Why did it take
[7971.56s -> 7985.59s]  this long? Just learn to read already. Try to pick up this rock. Where's the rock that I just
[7985.59s -> 8004.02s]  threw on the ground? Now I have to go to bed. It's just a regular rock. Oh, full of love of God.
[8004.90s -> 8016.47s]  Full of love of fucking God. Where is that rock that I had in my hand? And why can I pick it up?
[8030.49s -> 8050.12s]  Jesus. Okay, let's go. Come on. I need another obsidian rock now. Fuck. Why? I did it.
[8050.52s -> 8064.41s]  I let it go when I heard the sound. What do you mean wrong hands? It doesn't make any sense.
[8065.13s -> 8070.52s]  Do I really have to go on an expedition for a fucking obsidian rock? Because I can't get
[8070.52s -> 8076.54s]  this dumb thing out of here. Somebody's dead. I don't know. They wouldn't drink water while
[8076.54s -> 8082.46s]  they were standing. I can't help you if you're going to do that. How am I supposed to help you?
[8084.28s -> 8092.20s]  You won't even drink water while you're standing in the water. I didn't heal him. What do you mean
[8092.28s -> 8097.66s]  heal? And how do I tear this bed in half so I can pick up the fucking rock in here?
[8102.38s -> 8116.30s]  Oh my God. I have to go get a fucking rock. An obsidian rock to hit the... I need to sleep first
[8116.30s -> 8128.44s]  because there's no way I'm going to be able to do this without sleep. Go to bed. Okay.
[8131.61s -> 8146.94s]  Environmental analysis has been unlocked. I can detect rocks better. That's all I... That's it.
[8148.15s -> 8151.19s]  All right. Give me... Just keep this... Keep these ones around. These ones down here.
[8151.19s -> 8160.73s]  That's fine. And let's do item manipulation while moving. That's fine, too.
[8161.29s -> 8197.74s]  Okay. Go to bed. Rock hunt. Oh, found a rock. Good. Except it's not an obsidian rock,
[8197.74s -> 8222.68s]  so that's worthless to me. All right. Granite rock. Dead guy. Higher intelligence.
[8223.66s -> 8229.82s]  Branch. I don't think there are any... I would... I really want to get in there and get that rock,
[8229.82s -> 8242.68s]  but I fucking can't get in there and get that rock. I'm gonna eat and then go get a rock.
[8262.78s -> 8267.66s]  Yeah, I know I could have cured the bleeding, but I wanted to try... I wanted to try to combine
[8267.66s -> 8273.82s]  the fiber with something else. I could have like wiped him off, but I would rather try to combine
[8273.82s -> 8287.48s]  it. What's wrong with me? All right. I'm just going for it. No kids are with me. Give me a rock.
[8289.80s -> 8299.56s]  Invention's more important than lives. I'm just gonna have to go down here.
[8312.12s -> 8328.23s]  Branch. Fishing spot. Ran... Fuck. Just give me a... What are you doing here?
[8328.87s -> 8353.99s]  Why are you here? Get out of here. It's... Ew! How did you survive out here for so long? Holy shit.
[8354.55s -> 8372.52s]  I can't believe you're still alive. Is this... Is there a grip in this game? Okay. Good. Rest up
[8372.52s -> 8416.94s]  here. Look who I found, guys. Any rocks? No. No. Can I make obsidian? That'd be great.
[8419.51s -> 8423.78s]  You... You and I have to find a rock. And that's the only rock that I'm gonna have for the whole
[8423.78s -> 8446.89s]  clan. And we can't find one. So I'm just gonna bring you back. That's so bad. That looks so awful.
[8446.89s -> 8456.90s]  All right. Sit down. Hang out here for a little bit of you. I'm gonna sleep till tomorrow.
[8456.90s -> 8492.31s]  Hippopotamus? Oh, wait. It's noon. Never mind. All right. Who is left? I don't understand. I don't
[8492.31s -> 8500.65s]  know. I don't get it. I don't... What? I need some water or something, please.
[8503.05s -> 8521.40s]  I have to take the stick from you. Come here. Give me the stick. That's a rock. No, it's not.
[8521.40s -> 8539.03s]  That's that thing. Give me this. Stop paying attention to this and get over here. He's fucking
[8539.03s -> 8556.73s]  useless. No, now you go. Now you figure it out. I'm gonna take your stick, then. That's fine. All
[8556.73s -> 8562.50s]  right. Give me some... Let me eat. I can't believe I'm still on this fucking quest for a dumb rock.
[8567.48s -> 8597.62s]  There's an obsidian rock in my bed and I can't take it out. I can't, like, cover it up. I need
[8597.62s -> 8645.51s]  to make more children. Hit obsidian with normal rock. Are you kidding me? It's not gonna... It doesn't
[8645.51s -> 8665.66s]  work. Combine rock with head. Throw the rock at the obsidian? That's not gonna do anything.
[8665.66s -> 8673.22s]  Why is it so hard to find a one that's the most, like, prevalent rock on Earth? Just give me the
[8673.22s -> 8691.61s]  obsidian. It's right here. Just give it to me. Let's just have sex. Come here. We're a couple,
[8691.61s -> 8700.90s]  right? We gotta have some children. Come here. No, we're not. I thought we... I thought we were
[8700.90s -> 8726.39s]  together. I thought this was... Apparently not. Is it female elder?
[8727.51s -> 8747.24s]  It's okay. We still... It's still possible. We're good. That's it. We're good.
[8758.60s -> 8783.61s]  Okay, do we have to wait, like, till next year? We're going to bed till tomorrow. Wait,
[8783.69s -> 8789.27s]  are we both... We're both female? Is that true?
[8804.18s -> 8805.94s]  We gotta go extinct.
[8819.83s -> 8821.75s]  The male was the one that was bleeding.
[8826.79s -> 8835.45s]  Oh, is it it? Is that over? Range detection for non-edible resources has increased.
[8835.45s -> 8842.94s]  That's great. We're branching out, though. Hold on. Genetic mutation will be needed.
[8846.54s -> 8854.12s]  Okay, who's left? Spatial perception. Let's get this one down here as well.
[8854.92s -> 8861.05s]  There are wild males. I have to find them. Well, that's not gonna fucking work out.
[8861.93s -> 8885.59s]  Where's my mate? That's not right. No. Is it? No, that can't be right. No, that's not it.
[8885.59s -> 8905.91s]  Right there. There we go. We're good. There we are. We have a job to do. We have to... I gotta go.
[8905.91s -> 8911.50s]  All right, it's time to go. I'm not sitting around looking at a rock screen anymore. I
[8912.06s -> 8925.91s]  gotta get... I'm going. Give me a stick. I need to find new things. There's a new thing.
[8926.94s -> 8937.05s]  I'm going that way. It's right here. Let's go. Find a male. What do you think I'm trying to do
[8937.05s -> 8963.00s]  right now? I gotta try to find somebody. No, why are you here? You shouldn't be here. Both of you
[8963.00s -> 8981.67s]  shouldn't be here. Why are you both here? All right, I got them full on everything. It's time
[8981.67s -> 8987.40s]  to move this way. I need to get something. Something. I have to get something going.
[8990.66s -> 8998.89s]  There's that. We got something this way. There's nobody left at camp to watch them.
[8999.85s -> 9007.32s]  Right. That's... I guess that's true. We're gonna find it. We're gonna find a new camp,
[9007.96s -> 9014.60s]  a new settlement. Hopefully, it's right here. No, don't forget that. Memorize that.
[9015.48s -> 9039.14s]  All right, I gotta be careful. Don't do anything stupid. That was stupid. I'm fine. Okay, we're
[9039.14s -> 9051.98s]  good. We're there. Almost there. Whatever this is, whatever that is, I guess I'm gonna go look at it.
[9052.86s -> 9059.83s]  How's everybody doing? Okay, you're with me still? You have any sticks or anything?
[9061.19s -> 9074.09s]  No, you don't. Okay, let's get on the tree. I'm gonna go down over here. Now, what does it want
[9074.09s -> 9081.18s]  me to do over there? There's some big point of interest over there. What? Why didn't it not grab?
[9081.98s -> 9094.39s]  Okay, new stuff. It should have grabbed. Why did it not grab? What do you want me to do?
[9095.11s -> 9126.39s]  What just happened? The Sister Arches. New landmark. New camp. Discover the Sister Arches
[9126.39s -> 9141.53s]  as a memorable location. Good. So, what does that mean? Does that do anything for us? Not really?
[9142.33s -> 9157.19s]  All right. Well, okay. What's next? Stuff over here to look at. More of that fiber.
[9159.19s -> 9198.60s]  Hiding spot. It's a fucking obsidian. No, it's a granite rock. Wait. Hey. Hello. No, it's a pig.
[9208.70s -> 9219.93s]  What's that? Somebody else over here? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. How are you? Nice to meet you.
[9224.54s -> 9248.12s]  You all right? Something's wrong. Do you have any gypsum? Just get the food. Here.
[9248.94s -> 9265.18s]  Take this. Eat this. How you doing? You good? Okay. And let's get another one. Let's get some more.
[9268.26s -> 9303.26s]  Here. Try this. This will help. All right. Couple formed. All right. So, male. Okay.
[9318.74s -> 9321.30s]  All right. Stay right there. Stay. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Everyone chill.
[9327.48s -> 9334.62s]  Where's the beehive? Okay. I'll be right back. I'm going to get one of these beehives
[9334.62s -> 9342.78s]  and I'm going to heal you. Stay there. Don't move. Where's one? Right here. There's one right
[9342.78s -> 9354.46s]  at the top of this tree. I will be right back. It's a long fall. I think I can make the jump
[9354.46s -> 9392.94s]  from here to there. Give me it. Okay. I got it. Don't fall from that height. I want to climb down.
[9393.58s -> 9409.11s]  Can I make it from here? Yes, I can. All right. Come here. I got something for you over here.
[9410.22s -> 9417.72s]  Intimidate who? Who am I intimidating? Who am I intimidating? What the fuck is going on over
[9417.72s -> 9440.44s]  here? Is it a bird? Over here. Oh, hi. Okay. You. You are... Here you go. I got something for you.
[9441.48s -> 9485.67s]  Take that and rub it all over your body. You all right? What the fuck? I gave it to him.
[9486.86s -> 9492.71s]  I handed it to him. I think he's fine. He's not injured anymore. No, he's fine.
[9494.94s -> 9506.65s]  You have a broken bone. He... What? Did it take too long? All right. Let's go. New stuff.
[9510.04s -> 9520.41s]  Okay. We need to get back to... I can't go any further. This is literally the last of the entire
[9521.53s -> 9541.14s]  clan. Right? We're going to head back. Let's make a bed over here. Can I just make a bed with these?
[9541.78s -> 9582.94s]  I think I can. Get out of the way. I'm trying to make us a bed. Is that enough? We got to get
[9582.94s -> 9595.66s]  this going. All right. Come here. No, no, no, no. I need to settle. What do you mean settle? Settle?
[9602.66s -> 9610.78s]  Oh, I made this my news. On the edge of a mount on a cliff. We did it. We bought a new home.
[9611.50s -> 9626.86s]  You and me. And the old lady. We did it. All right. Let's go.
[9643.58s -> 9684.34s]  Hooray. Give birth. Let's go. New member. My child. 15 months later. Hey, Granny's still there.
[9685.14s -> 9705.99s]  I was probably supposed to do this in the first like 30 minutes. Ran right into the screen.
[9706.63s -> 9758.76s]  New baby. All right. Oh, there's another one. And she's so beautiful. Congrats on twins. I wonder if
[9758.76s -> 9781.18s]  you'll learn anything. Go for another. Can you? I don't think you can. Maybe you can. Where's the
[9781.18s -> 9816.60s]  other baby? Okay. What's this? New communication skill. That's a long way to go. I don't think it's
[9816.60s -> 9825.85s]  gonna make it. It's not gonna make it. Oh, it made it. It's not possible to ask from a distance some
[9825.85s -> 9831.66s]  clan members to come closer and follow. Hold B and release B to have the visible clan members
[9831.66s -> 9839.75s]  follow you. Okay. Body language. I need to do some more like punching and kicking.
[9841.54s -> 9853.69s]  Evolution. Explore. Expand. Feared rival. Feared species. What is this shit? Advanced problem
[9853.69s -> 9859.16s]  solver? To launch an evolution, you must be at your clan settlement and have passed at
[9859.16s -> 9869.21s]  least one generation and succeeded in evolutionary feat. Leading tool user rocks. Use the tool ready.
[9869.93s -> 9882.98s]  Ready one. Ready three. Are these just achievements? Evolve. Birth of a cartographer.
[9882.98s -> 9911.13s]  Okay. Now. I'm not mating again. No. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Item manipulation. Drop
[9911.13s -> 9923.37s]  while moving. Body language. And this one. Okay. Change generation? Is that what I'm gonna do?
[9924.09s -> 9929.62s]  When passing a generation, the neurons that have not been reinforced will lose their energy and
[9929.62s -> 9936.10s]  will have to be refilled. All unborn babies will also be lost. Do you want to still pass
[9936.10s -> 9977.48s]  a generation? Am I doing this? So we, we, these are the kids that are grown up now.
[9979.37s -> 9990.02s]  15 years later. Is that grandma? 15 years later? 15 years. 15 years. Reinforce your
[9990.02s -> 9996.15s]  lineage's neural development. Early phase one. What do you mean 15 years? Metabolism is now
[9996.15s -> 10027.19s]  effective. Where is everybody? Oh, okay. This is you. Where is everybody? Who am I? Who are you?
[10028.23s -> 10050.92s]  Oh, that's you. Okay. That's you. Okay. You and who am I? Okay. No, there's a lot of people here.
[10050.92s -> 10061.70s]  All right. So this is you. I'm going to play as you. All right. We're good. Anybody have any kids?
[10063.00s -> 10083.29s]  You have any kids? Okay. So we have to, we have to do some, somebody has to have a kid. Oh,
[10083.29s -> 10088.39s]  shit. Look at that. You and the members of this, of the lineage will have the capacity to better
[10088.39s -> 10095.58s]  metabolize nutrients. This spontaneous genetic mutation will become effective after the lineage's
[10095.58s -> 10111.19s]  next evolution. Okay. This is right. All right. I need to, we need to, we need to go out there.
[10112.15s -> 10122.76s]  Okay. There's a lot of people. We got to fit this big amount of people here. So let's do,
[10123.72s -> 10153.66s]  I want, wait, let's get some rocks. First things first. Let's eat. Okay. How's everybody doing on
[10153.66s -> 10166.84s]  thirst? Have some sticks and some rocks and some spirits. Let's take a look at the new destination
[10166.84s -> 10174.20s]  we've got. Oh, somebody is over there. I think there's children. There's like 30 people in this
[10174.20s -> 10191.13s]  clan. Tribe or whatever this is. What is like a bunch of, what, what, what is it called? Is it a,
[10191.85s -> 10208.89s]  is it a clan? A gaggle? I got a gaggle. Okay. What is that? I found the big stick in the middle of
[10208.89s -> 10222.78s]  the forest. Let's go look at it. What did you want to do here? Is that not what you wanted me to do?
[10223.50s -> 10262.57s]  Oh, it's not actually anything. Okay. Grass, fishing spot. Still, by the way, just want to
[10262.57s -> 10268.90s]  make sure everyone's aware. I haven't seen a single obsidian rock on the rock. It's been 17 years.
[10286.20s -> 10290.68s]  I, this is just danger. I don't want to do this. This is bad crocodiles and shit everywhere.
[10292.36s -> 10303.43s]  This is a stupid idea. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you all going?
[10303.43s -> 10307.99s]  Where are you all going? Don't don't. Why are you running? Why are you running? Why are you all
[10307.99s -> 10322.49s]  running the random directions? Excuse me. See you in rock though. We got to get some sticks.
[10326.92s -> 10341.96s]  Something right there that I don't know what it is. Oh, hold on. New tool. New tool. New
[10341.96s -> 10351.59s]  gathering spot. It is a hole to poke. Dammit. All right. I need to give me this. Can I take a
[10351.59s -> 10366.14s]  branch off this or something? I got some more senses. I want to poke that hole. Is it a note?
[10369.35s -> 10380.30s]  Run. Run. Oh my God. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up the tree, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
[10380.30s -> 10391.00s]  up the tree, up the tree. Everybody. Oh, my whole fucking body hurts. Up, up, up, up, everybody.
[10414.42s -> 10430.49s]  Okay. Random fucking tiger. Obsidian. Is it obsidian? It's probably the loudest sound I've
[10430.49s -> 10443.86s]  ever done. You still around? No, there's alligators and shit. How are you ever supposed to do this?
[10447.56s -> 10457.80s]  This is not even possible. How did anybody, how did humans survive? I can't even find a fucking rock
[10457.80s -> 10475.72s]  on the ground. And you tell me that we've, no way. We were dropped off by aliens. Up the tree,
[10475.72s -> 10501.19s]  everybody. I'm like bleeding. I need one of those fucking beehives. Here we go. Up here.
[10501.75s -> 10523.77s]  There might just be one up here. There it is. Give me it. Okay. Use it. Anybody else hurt?
[10524.41s -> 10539.80s]  I got another one of these. Nobody bleeding. I just want a rock. I don't want to come this far
[10539.80s -> 10552.68s]  out on an expedition. I just want a rock. I want an obsidian rock. Can't get it. I need a stick.
[10553.24s -> 10574.09s]  I want to poke these rock. Let's go back to camp. I need to fly. Seriously. Have everybody
[10574.09s -> 10582.58s]  else stay home while you get a rock so nobody dies. That's not a bad idea. That statement that
[10582.58s -> 10592.15s]  is made is stupid. What the hell is going on now? Everybody stay home till I so I can find a rock.
[10592.15s -> 10612.55s]  Okay. Let's go. What is over? It's a snake, I think. Snake maybe somewhere. Back to camp. Let's go.
[10617.86s -> 10636.76s]  Down there. I need to, is anybody else bleeding? Just eat. Seven out of ten. Seven out of ten.
[10637.56s -> 10647.59s]  What are you talking about? Can I combine these two? I wonder if I can combine.
[10649.30s -> 10660.65s]  Maybe I can. Don't try this at home. All right. Here we are. Back at our camp. It's currently
[10660.65s -> 10672.28s]  15 o'clock. I'm gonna combine these. No I'm not. Let me take a good look at all of you.
[10674.10s -> 10690.20s]  Anybody bleeding? What does end expedition even mean? I'm gonna leave this here. Who would have
[10690.20s -> 10692.84s]  thought finding sticks would have been the hardest fucking thing in this whole game?
[10698.60s -> 10709.40s]  There was one tree that had sticks. I don't fucking want to do this thing, man.
[10712.70s -> 10716.94s]  Here. You take this. I don't know. Whatever. Can I use this? Maybe combine these two?
[10720.39s -> 10731.22s]  No. Can I poke at the hole? All right. Everybody stay here. Wait. All of you. Nobody come with me.
[10731.22s -> 10754.49s]  I don't want to see one person here. Stay. You too. All of you. Stay. Okay. I'm gonna go poke that
[10754.49s -> 10764.10s]  hole. See what happens. It's down here, right? There was another one. I can't believe it's just
[10764.10s -> 10783.46s]  granite. Where the hell am I gonna find them? Just mix lava and water. It's easier said than done.
[10784.18s -> 10790.02s]  Oh, finally. Okay. I'm actually kind of glad you came with me because we need to make some sticks.
[10790.66s -> 10825.80s]  Take this. Now get the fuck out of here. Can I combine both the two sticks together for any
[10825.80s -> 10831.64s]  reason? No. Just dual welding. Okay. That's fine. All right. Now, this is a stick I can poke with
[10831.64s -> 10853.06s]  these. Fucking granite. Where was the hole? I really don't even know where the hole was. I
[10853.06s -> 10878.60s]  thought they were right here. There it is. All right. Here we go. Poking. Food can be poked out
[10879.56s -> 10889.72s]  of holes. Okay. So how do I learn stabbing if you know you can poke? Why can't you know you can
[10889.72s -> 10904.25s]  stab? I haven't learned that yet, apparently. I hear something. There's something coming.
[10925.24s -> 10934.04s]  Right there. Shake? Oh, it's dropping coconuts.
[10937.59s -> 10955.85s]  Coconuts have fallen. This is awesome. Okay. Hold on. I think it's a pig. Yeah, it's a pig.
[10970.92s -> 10988.54s]  He's just chilled. I'm trying to spear this motherfucker.
[10998.36s -> 11002.44s]  I'm walking bait. Wait, can I stick it? Wait, hold on. I think I can do this.
[11004.95s -> 11032.63s]  No, I want to stick a straw in there and drink it. I swear to fucking God, man. What?
[11033.59s -> 11043.06s]  Oh, why does this have to fucking happen? God damn it. That's two in a row. Twice in a row.
[11045.66s -> 11061.40s]  All right. Why can't the boar come over here? Shake coconuts off his head. Get away from me.
[11067.85s -> 11070.41s]  No, get... No, no, no. Don't call anybody.
[11109.43s -> 11137.10s]  Get away from... Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I need one of those things. No!
[11164.09s -> 11200.62s]  Ew. Is that you? Ew. Come here. Ew. You all right? Oh, no, that's not... No, I'm all right.
[11200.62s -> 11216.70s]  I'm you. Right. I know. Fucking rock. I want a fucking obsidian rock.
[11218.34s -> 11245.03s]  Why is that such a rare resource in this game? Okay. I can use granite? Well, why... Don't I need
[11245.03s -> 11251.69s]  obsidian to scrape the granite to make it so it's a scrappy rock? I thought that was the whole deal.
[11251.77s -> 11255.91s]  Otherwise, what the hell have I been doing for the last, like, 45 minutes?
[11259.02s -> 11273.18s]  I can just use two rocks. My caramba. What is... No, give me that. No, give that back to me.
[11274.30s -> 11282.22s]  Yeah, you can't be trusted with this. This is mine. I need to sleep. Back to bed. Let's go.
[11283.18s -> 11313.91s]  I did end an expedition. I don't know what that does. All right. We got some new stuff to do.
[11313.91s -> 11322.25s]  What's over here? How motor skills will improve. The neuron can't be initiated because you don't
[11322.25s -> 11335.75s]  have the neurological energy. Carrying kids will perform... So I have to carry it on the kids.
[11336.39s -> 11367.56s]  Do you want to sleep? I also need a water source. Yeah. Am I lying in with a skeleton?
[11369.02s -> 11387.53s]  There's bones in here. I'm sleeping in a grave. All right. Now give me a rock. Give me two rocks.
[11388.41s -> 11397.45s]  I need to drink water. And then... I don't even remember what the fuck I was going to do with
[11397.45s -> 11407.40s]  those rocks. I have no clue. I was going to do something with the fiber, with the rock,
[11407.40s -> 11425.67s]  that could be grinding. Right? I want to eat, not pick up an item on the ground.
[11434.42s -> 11464.55s]  This is not very nutritious. How much do I have to drink of this shit? Is there anybody to even
[11464.55s -> 11484.23s]  tell? There's just a big green circle on my screen. Just drink it all. All right. I'm going to make
[11484.23s -> 11490.31s]  this a... Give me... Here we go. There we... Oh, you found two rocks. He found two fucking rocks.
[11490.31s -> 11517.14s]  I'm unbelievable. All right. Now get out of here. Give me this. Give me a fiber. No, give me this
[11517.14s -> 11532.63s]  thing. Can I like grind it with the sharpening thing? Let's see what happens. No, no, no, no,
[11532.63s -> 11537.37s]  no, no, no, no. I need to... Give me one of those hives. There's always one there on top of the
[11537.37s -> 11573.34s]  trees. Go. What's that? I heard something over here. What? Somebody just hit bro. Mother fucker.
[11573.34s -> 11577.74s]  Where are these things? I swear to God, every time I'm looking for something, it's not on the
[11577.74s -> 11602.20s]  screen. There were just like 300 of these and now they just don't... They don't exist. What?
[11607.74s -> 11619.43s]  Where are all the honeycombs? It's been hours and I'm still a monkey. Yeah. Sorry. I'm a little...
[11619.43s -> 11641.26s]  I'm getting a little slow to the renaissance period. Sorry, guys. There they are. And I'm
[11641.26s -> 11648.04s]  hungry too. I'm very hungry. Like too hungry to even grab anything. Is there birds in this stuff
[11648.04s -> 11660.01s]  here? What is this? This is like a huge nest. New discovery eggs. New discovery egg. Who cares
[11660.01s -> 11679.53s]  about this thing? I want... Give me the egg. Inspect it. Cook egg. Quick. Take one. Take it.
[11679.53s -> 11690.78s]  Take an egg. Quick. Take a couple of them. Drop it. Okay. I'm fine. All right. I got two eggs.
[11712.94s -> 11731.05s]  Yeah. The spoils of war. Let's go get another one. I also have to get the rock.
[11731.77s -> 11750.07s]  I left a rock up here. I need that thing. Where was it? Over here? Where was it? Where's my rock?
[11750.63s -> 11768.47s]  All right. Let's do... Let's Spider-Man this. Let's get a good view. What the fuck are you doing?
[11770.82s -> 11783.88s]  Remember, every action is the same button. Oh my god. What? Did you press A? Press A again. A.
[11783.88s -> 11809.98s]  Hold A. Let go of A. Press A. Hold A. Let go of A. Press A twice. I'm bleeding. I need one of those
[11809.98s -> 11816.36s]  things. I gotta find one. I know. I know I'm bleeding. I just need one of those things,
[11816.36s -> 11823.62s]  but I got so disoriented. Let's... All right. Down there. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.
[11837.94s -> 11856.92s]  Give me another one. Give me my rock. I got my rock, motherfucker. See you later. Okay. So far,
[11856.92s -> 11873.43s]  so good. Now I just gotta get to... Over here. There it is. Go. Okay. Use it. I gotta stand on top.
[11874.87s -> 11877.83s]  What's this? It's a golden egg up here. There's a golden egg. There's a golden egg here.
[11878.47s -> 11883.61s]  I'm gonna pick up the golden egg. It's a golden egg. I'm gonna say the same thing five times.
[11883.61s -> 11892.41s]  Ten times. What's this golden egg? No. I know what this is. You fucking idiot.
[11893.61s -> 11897.05s]  I know what you're fucking rock. All right. Stop. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11897.85s -> 11916.52s]  What is this? New food? Oh. These things are very nutritious.
[11922.20s -> 11939.96s]  They're similar to nutrients from this dope food. Okay. I got it. I have my rock. I just need...
[11940.60s -> 11974.58s]  I wish I had a... I wish I had a backpack. Can I make, like, soup? Never mind. Thank God.
[11980.06s -> 11983.66s]  Okay. Seriously, I don't want to, like, let go of A, but I have to.
[11989.91s -> 11995.21s]  I'm finally gonna do it. Here's the funny music, the good music, the you did it music. Here we go.
[11996.09s -> 12003.66s]  It's time. I have in my hands right now, I have a grinding stone and fiber. I'm about to do something
[12003.66s -> 12042.60s]  that will... it's taking four hours to do. You lied to me. Keep doing it. Keep doing it. Keep
[12042.60s -> 12062.54s]  doing it. Keep going. Not long enough. I can't do it in the tree. I have to do it on the ground.
[12078.09s -> 12082.46s]  Another jump scare tiger down here. Let me make sure. Hold on.
[12084.55s -> 12093.98s]  Do it on the ground. Do I need to do it on top of sticks or something?
[12095.35s -> 12098.63s]  I need an obsidian grinding stone. If that's the case, if that's true,
[12099.59s -> 12103.03s]  I'm going to be very angry because that's what I've been looking for.
[12103.59s -> 12106.82s]  Everyone told me no. I don't need that. All right, let's try it. Here we go.
[12117.34s -> 12127.48s]  Every button is the same button. Don't you understand? I fucking hate that so much.
[12137.45s -> 12148.73s]  Where is it? It doesn't matter. I can just... just give me... it's right here somewhere. It's
[12148.73s -> 12155.46s]  right here, right? Just give me this one. Just fucking bang the rocks together again. They're
[12155.46s -> 12164.12s]  right here. Give me the fucking rock. Give me two of them, please. Thank you. Give me another one.
[12167.77s -> 12174.01s]  Sorry. Jump is also grab is also hold is also laugh is also grind is also fucking eat is also
[12174.89s -> 12213.02s]  groom. It's also run. Where? All right. So should I fucking just do both of them? No.
[12213.82s -> 12221.30s]  Don't throw it. Keep it in your hand. All right. Screw this. Here's what I'm doing.
[12221.94s -> 12224.90s]  I'm fucking gonna turn this guy. I'm gonna turn this into a panini press.
[12225.78s -> 12238.94s]  No, I want to do both rocks. Whatever. Can I only have which one is the which one's the griddle?
[12238.94s -> 12246.50s]  Okay, good. Got it. Okay. Should I maybe try to grab at least they do try this thing. Maybe
[12246.50s -> 12291.82s]  I should try doing this. I'm going home. He's furious. I'm not furious. I'm fine. I'm fine.
[12291.82s -> 12315.42s]  Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine. But I will. I will put this down. I want to have. Yes,
[12315.42s -> 12320.22s]  I got a grinder. I have a grinder in my hand. But what the hell do I do with a grinder grind up
[12320.22s -> 12337.10s]  berries, seeds, berries? What? I don't understand. What do you? Why do I have this? That's so bad.
[12337.66s -> 12347.90s]  There's only mushrooms. All right. So let's think about a scenario here where I don't get killed by
[12347.90s -> 12372.26s]  the boar that's near me. Make a stick and kill the boar that there ain't even any combat in
[12372.26s -> 12393.64s]  this game. I don't know what's going on. He's even killing other players. He's killing other
[12393.64s -> 12399.16s]  players that aren't even me. What is there? Is there a cop? Why is this flashlight in my eyes?
[12405.74s -> 12416.79s]  Help! Help! Where is he? I want to go to the boar and like pick up the boar meat.
[12417.51s -> 12441.78s]  When am I going to discover fire? I don't think I'm going to discover fire. I'm having trouble
[12441.78s -> 12461.08s]  discovering rocks on the ground. You think I'm going to be able to do fire? What is it? Why?
[12461.08s -> 12466.95s]  Why? What's here? What's here? Okay, just get rid of one of these fucking rocks. Which one of them
[12466.95s -> 12471.75s]  is the grill? Which one of the rocks is like the griddle? Why is this? Am I being stalked? I can't
[12471.83s -> 12477.83s]  tell which one is the grill on it. I don't know. Can anyone see? Okay, it's mounted in my left hand.
[12477.83s -> 12491.93s]  That means right hand I can just throw it. I don't care. Okay, now what is this? What is this? Why is
[12491.93s -> 12514.10s]  it telling me to like look at this or be aware of this? Inspect. No. Go to the light. Should I?
[12514.10s -> 12534.66s]  What? Should I do that? Why is it doing some Truman Show shit? What did I just do? I just picked that
[12534.66s -> 12557.43s]  up and waterfall. All right, there's the tiger and there's the boar. I'm gonna be patient here.
[12557.43s -> 12568.20s]  I'll just sleep. Look at that. I want it. I want it. I'm gonna wait till he's gone. Should I throw
[12568.20s -> 12571.96s]  the panini at him? Should I? I'm gonna throw my fucking panini at him and see if he leaves.
[12578.44s -> 12581.32s]  Don't don't do that. Wait, hold on. There's probably something I can throw over there,
[12582.12s -> 12590.71s]  right? Like a stick or a branch or something. I want that so bad. All right, here we go. All
[12590.71s -> 12597.38s]  right. I've got it. I'm just gonna throw this over there because I want to build. I want to go like
[12597.38s -> 12603.88s]  sniff. I want to go smell the corpse. That's what they do. Is that the panini? I can't tell.
[12604.76s -> 12612.44s]  I don't even know what's in my hands. Okay, what's in my right hand? Okay, here we go. Ready? See if
[12612.44s -> 12634.04s]  I can get him to move over here. Dude, I would love to do a jumping R1 on this fucking tiger right now.
[12642.74s -> 12646.50s]  Why did it just put me like all the way down here? There's another combat scenario coming up here.
[12647.30s -> 12663.59s]  There's a snake. Snake is going to the tiger right now. Look it. See? That's gonna be huge.
[12663.59s -> 12667.27s]  This could be huge for me. I just have to observe and the snake might kill.
[12668.15s -> 12673.74s]  Snake is right there. The snake might kill the tiger from behind.
[12679.05s -> 12699.26s]  This is great. I love climbing. Apparently didn't learn that. Okay, sit right there. Is that not a
[12699.26s -> 12710.76s]  snake? How do I get you to leave? Any rock plus stick equals weapon. I did. I tried that before.
[12711.64s -> 12721.37s]  Can I sneak up and grab a stick? The only stick I can see is literally right here.
[12722.01s -> 12727.40s]  There's a stick there. That's the only thing I can get it. I'm gonna try.
[12757.56s -> 12778.50s]  This is scary. I made it. Okay, this is my chance. This is my opportunity to intimidate. I got my
[12778.50s -> 12797.59s]  rock. What's wrong with me? Oh, I'm about to lose my mind. I'm about to lose my mind, right?
[12798.39s -> 12802.71s]  Sniping with the rock. Okay, I gotta go for it right now. This is the time.
[12803.19s -> 12812.90s]  Nope. Quick for other generations.
[12840.73s -> 12872.66s]  Do we get to meet a tiger? We're fine. No more fucking around. I am pissed.
[12875.53s -> 12892.73s]  Give me a rock. Give me a stick. I wonder if it's gonna take me like another 40 minutes to find a
[12892.73s -> 12912.86s]  rock. Assemble a crew and avenge. Liftable rock. Got it. Oh, it actually means I can just
[12912.86s -> 12946.38s]  pick it up. Okay, here we go. Ready? I'm making a deadly fucking weapon. A granite rock and
[12946.38s -> 12959.16s]  altar stick. I already knew that. I now have my weapon in my hand. What's that thing? What's that?
[12961.13s -> 12977.06s]  There's frogs. Hold on. Wait, wait, there's frogs. Can I pick them up? No. What was that? What is
[12977.06s -> 12992.12s]  wrong with me? What the fuck was that? Does it mean I'm tired? All right, well, I got a stick.
[12995.77s -> 13000.97s]  I need to hit something. The only combat that the game told me for a tutorial was
[13000.97s -> 13007.82s]  A is dodge. I wonder if A is swing too. I mean, everything in this whole fucking game is A,
[13007.82s -> 13019.74s]  so I would be shocked if it wasn't A to swing. All right, I'm going to bed. A is counter-attack.
[13019.74s -> 13044.15s]  A is dodge. A is jump. A is learn. A. A for ape. Of course. I want to make another couple of sticks.
[13045.03s -> 13048.14s]  When can I evolve to literally use my other hand for anything?
[13049.02s -> 13059.06s]  I'm not just lefty. I don't have access to my left arm. I mean, I'm not just a righty. I don't
[13059.06s -> 13094.44s]  have any access to my left hand. Where is my stick? Where's the stick that actually has a
[13094.44s -> 13122.39s]  sharp end to it? I'm killing this motherfucker right now. I just wanted to go to sleep. I just
[13122.39s -> 13126.15s]  wanted to go to bed. I just wanted to get a rock and go to sleep. And now I'm gonna die.
[13127.03s -> 13142.63s]  And I'm underwater now, so I can't even... There it is. Where's the bed?
[13145.08s -> 13148.52s]  Where's the bed? The whole... This is... I'm looking... It's like cell-shaded graphics now.
[13149.16s -> 13171.56s]  Is somebody pissed in my cell-shaded graphics space? Okay. Like, what... Where is the bed? Sleep
[13171.56s -> 13196.01s]  it off. All you gotta do... Okay, food and water is bad. Very bad. Not good at all. I need to... Hold
[13196.01s -> 13213.22s]  on. Do I have enough for this yet? No, I don't have any, like, children. Oh, no. My birth and
[13213.22s -> 13224.82s]  death rate is terrible. I can't do any of these. Well, I know that there is water down here,
[13225.46s -> 13240.38s]  but there's food as well. There is. Everybody come over here and eat. You've died every time
[13240.38s -> 13253.58s]  somebody's been born. Well, come on. My only goals in this game are to eat food and dodge tigers.
[13272.15s -> 13274.95s]  Failed both of them? Yeah, one of those is a lot easier than the other one.
[13275.59s -> 13296.60s]  You're gonna over-hydrate and die. Hey, anybody else? Fucking idiot and doesn't want to drink?
[13296.60s -> 13300.52s]  Come on down here. You need me to shut you out of the way. You can lead a man to water,
[13300.52s -> 13308.70s]  but you can't make him fish or whatever it is. You can teach a man to fish, but you can't
[13308.70s -> 13311.26s]  give him water. I don't know. Whatever that saying is. You know what it is.
[13325.51s -> 13342.76s]  What's wrong with the one on the left? They all have, like, stomach aches. What is wrong with you?
[13343.48s -> 13357.54s]  Are you hungry? He's holding food in his hand. Or is that a ring? Give me that,
[13359.14s -> 13377.75s]  you idiot. He wouldn't eat it. He was holding his stomach on. Oh, man. I wish I had something to
[13377.75s -> 13390.49s]  eat in my... I wish I had a ring pop like what's in my right hand. Okay, now it's time. The hot
[13390.49s -> 13403.22s]  today is gone. All right, give me a fucking spear. Shake the tree. No, give me a... It's time for a
[13403.22s -> 13448.66s]  smoke break. It might be. Smoke break. I'm gonna start drinking. Am I dead? Oh well. Better. Let me
[13448.66s -> 13455.94s]  grind up a rock on this. Have a weapon. Go take a smoke break. I don't smoke. Don't worry.
[13456.90s -> 13472.38s]  Add to pile? What does that do? Can I just have, like, a few of them here? I guess. Weird. Okay.
[13472.78s -> 13484.73s]  All right. Let me just hang... I'm gonna have a sharpened spear. I gotta... You know what? I wish
[13484.73s -> 13491.67s]  they would just pick it up. Why am I the only person that ever grabs anything? It's been 17
[13491.67s -> 13504.10s]  years and nobody's picking up any sticks? Well, you didn't hand it to me. Okay. Here. Can you do
[13504.10s -> 13514.84s]  something with this? I have to, like, equip all of my people with stuff. Why don't they learn?
[13515.24s -> 13523.67s]  I'm the only one that learns here. Nobody else does. In fact, they're so fucking stupid.
[13523.67s -> 13531.02s]  If they're holding an item, they will starve to death. Why? You didn't tell me to eat!
[13537.98s -> 13564.62s]  Now it's time to just relax. Get over here. I'm gonna get my rock. I'm gonna make a couple
[13564.62s -> 13572.36s]  of spears and I'm gonna go on an expedition. Here's food over here. I'm just gonna hang...
[13573.00s -> 13581.16s]  Here's food over here. I'm just gonna hang... No, don't end the expedition.
[13582.04s -> 13588.15s]  Where's there a fucking... This is... Okay, there's already one made here. This is the plan.
[13589.83s -> 13603.05s]  Now I just need a rock and then the three of us are gonna go. Species is evolved. Yeah, we already
[13603.05s -> 13607.94s]  did evolve. This is 17 years have gone by. There's already been another generation.
[13608.74s -> 13639.61s]  You need to have babies. What is going on? Yeah, what? Evolution, guys. You don't... We grew, like,
[13639.61s -> 13645.35s]  extra hands and fingers from our grandparents. It takes, like, 10 years, right? All right,
[13645.35s -> 13662.65s]  give me my sticks. I'm gonna mate. We're gonna have some babies. We're gonna go out with our
[13662.65s -> 13694.65s]  three spears and I'm ready. God. I'll be right back. I... I'll be right back. I... Fuck it. I'll be back.
[13694.65s -> 13893.51s]  I... I didn't even care what happened to me. Do I still have the rock in my hand?
[13915.11s -> 13917.19s]  Don't cry. I'm gonna be fine.
[13924.62s -> 13927.90s]  Get kids and carry them around. Do you guys remember, like, a couple hours ago when I was
[13927.90s -> 13934.12s]  doing that and everybody told me not to do that anymore because I was endangering the children?
[13934.12s -> 13939.43s]  Turns out it was what I was supposed to be doing the whole time. All right, I've got... Give me the
[13939.43s -> 13953.16s]  third stick. Your ancestors were fucking stupid. Hey, well, guess what? They were your fucking
[13953.16s -> 13960.82s]  ancestors, too. You think that's gonna offend me? This is your great-great-great-great-great
[13960.82s -> 13999.59s]  grandparents, too. So, I have weapons. Three spears are made. Maybe I should do a fourth just
[13999.59s -> 14007.74s]  to make sure we're all ready. Do I... Is that it? One more? Sometimes it's hard to tell. Okay,
[14007.74s -> 14019.48s]  another one. One... One more? Okay. Three spears. There are one... Here comes the deep freeze. Here
[14019.48s -> 14033.19s]  comes the ice age. All right. One, two, three. There are four of us. Four spears. We're gonna have,
[14033.19s -> 14068.63s]  like, three kids make a fire. I have no idea how to do that. Every time I've tried to, it doesn't...
[14069.27s -> 14081.06s]  I bang two rocks together, scrape two rocks, grab a leaf, scrape a leaf, rub two sticks together
[14081.06s -> 14086.87s]  on top of leaves. I don't think I can do fire. Didn't somebody say I couldn't do that yet?
[14087.67s -> 14093.96s]  Okay, I got four spears. Let's put them down. I'm gonna... This is my community rock.
[14093.96s -> 14105.43s]  Just let it sit there. Who wants to come lie down with me? What have we got? I... Am I female?
[14106.23s -> 14121.70s]  I'm not sure. All right, come here. You. I think you and I should be hanging out,
[14121.70s -> 14187.56s]  maybe. All right, come to bed. We need two kids, and they have evolved. Four spears for the four of
[14187.56s -> 14200.10s]  us. We're gonna go out. We're gonna douche. We're gonna... We're gonna make it happen. I have to
[14200.10s -> 14214.74s]  watch this every time. It wouldn't be bad if it was not the same cutscene. Like, do like three
[14214.74s -> 14224.68s]  different potential cutscenes. Here we go. Doing it again. Baby with the spontaneity's genetic
[14224.68s -> 14246.86s]  mutation. Here comes another one. We're gonna wear both the babies. Gonna go out, dig up some
[14246.86s -> 14255.77s]  mushrooms. Hopefully, down a taiga while we're at it. You know what I mean? Down a taiga. Get a...
[14256.57s -> 14290.15s]  Eat, drink, be equipped. I wonder if he's gonna run into the camera. Cool. All right, two babies.
[14290.15s -> 14297.30s]  Let's go. Have we slept? Have we... We've slept, I think, right? All right, let's go, kids.
[14302.38s -> 14314.07s]  Everybody gather up. What are they doing? You slept for two years. Okay, everybody,
[14315.37s -> 14334.44s]  listen up. What I want you to do is I want you to grab a stick. Mannequins. All of you. Here,
[14334.44s -> 14347.80s]  this one's for you. All right, we are now armed. I want to pick up the kids. How do I pick up these
[14347.80s -> 14365.35s]  kids? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's head to the stream. I would like everybody to eat something
[14365.35s -> 14379.75s]  before we move out. Follow my lead. Pick up a berry. Eat it. Watch me. You know what? No,
[14379.75s -> 14385.03s]  let's go fishing. Let's go fishing and just eat raw fish and shit. Whatever. With me, let's go.
[14385.75s -> 14404.78s]  Where's that fishing spot? I know there's one over here. All right, learn through me. Do as I do.
[14405.50s -> 14411.53s]  I mean, somebody's gonna make a reference here about something seeing and something doing,
[14412.25s -> 14439.61s]  but I'm not gonna make that. Just follow me and do what I do. And got one. Oh, this is a fish.
[14439.61s -> 14453.45s]  This is a bass. This will feed us for days. Okay, who's gonna eat this? Should you eat this?
[14455.35s -> 14463.19s]  All right, I'm gonna show you how to eat this. See? I took a bite out of it. It's good, huh? Hey,
[14463.19s -> 14484.38s]  kid, try this. Don't try this, actually. You probably shouldn't try this. Okay, now you try.
[14485.18s -> 14493.91s]  See? It's pretty good. Try it. Don't eat it all. Don't eat the whole thing. Greedy.
[14494.79s -> 14505.22s]  Very greedy. You shouldn't be doing that. See? You pissed up Dave behind you. Take your stick back.
[14505.22s -> 14513.86s]  Let's do it again. Look at me. Follow me. These kids are gonna learn this too. This is an invaluable
[14513.86s -> 14532.74s]  skill. Here we go. Ready? Is it gone? Fucking Chad walk. Oh, hey, we should have given you that
[14532.74s -> 14539.43s]  fish. All right, stay there. That's what I was talking about. This is why you don't eat the whole
[14539.43s -> 14565.29s]  thing. What happened? Where did my stick go? Oh, give me a fucking break. Isn't this a fishing spot?
[14565.85s -> 14574.23s]  No, you can have this back.
[14578.54s -> 14589.96s]  So, why can't I not? Somebody, we gotta help this guy. This haha, I keep losing stuff. It's
[14589.96s -> 14604.18s]  not funny anymore. Here, take a crab. Haha, I keep losing stuff. Here. Actually, no, no, no.
[14609.43s -> 14623.93s]  Take this. Eat. Delicious, huh? How do you feel? You feel better? Good. Pop. All right, let's go.
[14624.65s -> 14631.00s]  Everybody. Pa, you don't have a weapon, but that's all right. Look at. Are you gonna fish?
[14631.72s -> 14644.12s]  You're gonna fish? She's gonna do it. All right, let's keep moving. We are going to examine
[14645.24s -> 14651.50s]  that. Get it into your memory and then forget it.
[14670.07s -> 14688.22s]  No crocodiles. Let's go. This game is really cool. Haters be gone. I think this game is really cool.
[14688.70s -> 14696.52s]  I think this is a really, really awesome game underneath a layer of unintuitive control.
[14697.56s -> 14714.44s]  Like this is, this is, we talk about fossils. This is a fossil that's underneath
[14714.44s -> 14724.04s]  a layer of fucking sand. There's gold under there, but you've got to dig down like 25 feet to get it.
[14724.68s -> 14745.51s]  And right here, there it is. I found the giant waterfall. I'm gonna get a cut scene, right?
[14745.51s -> 14751.77s]  But this is like, oh, this is an Irish spring. It must be an Irish spring.
[14752.25s -> 14781.35s]  I just turn the fucking stream off and I never stream again. I make one tweet a year that says
[14781.35s -> 14794.49s]  it's an Irish spring. You never see me again. Something going on here. Something going on here.
[14795.05s -> 14808.46s]  All right. Did he pick somebody up? What happened? We good? Why are you all hiding?
[14812.36s -> 14823.56s]  We're supposed to work together as a team. God damn it. Fucking useless. Useless. Useless.
[14823.56s -> 14837.70s]  Useless. What? Something in the water. Don't go in the water. Stay out of the water. Everyone
[14837.70s -> 14878.70s]  out of the water. Don't go in the water. What is in the water? Hiding spot. All right. We got to
[14878.70s -> 14882.78s]  make it. This is the new shelter. We're making camp here and then we're going to evolve. I'm
[14882.78s -> 14896.07s]  pressing the button. No, don't make noise. Where is it? What is it? What is it? What's the noise
[14896.07s -> 14906.20s]  here? What are we supposed to be looking for? I don't know what's wrong. I'm starting to get
[14906.20s -> 14914.81s]  a little scared here. How do I fix a broken leg? I gotta sleep. All right. Fuck it. Make camp.
[14916.23s -> 14922.42s]  I need some sticks. I need some twigs. I need some yarn. Where's our newest recruit? He needs to
[14922.42s -> 14932.01s]  get away. Take my stick. Take this. No. Take it. Take this. What are you holding? You have a stick.
[14932.01s -> 14942.10s]  Who doesn't have a stick? You. Come here. You're gonna fucking hurt too. All right. It's time to
[14942.10s -> 14961.94s]  set up shop. Okay. Where is this thing? It's spawned. Get in the water. Everybody get in the
[14961.94s -> 14980.38s]  water. We all lions hate water. Use your sticks. Do something. Somebody do something. He's spawned
[14980.38s -> 14993.93s]  in. Somebody scare him. He won't come in the water. What was that? Why do we all get sucked down?
[14997.56s -> 15006.79s]  Okay. We got like pulled in like the undertow. What is in here? It is the undertow, isn't it?
[15007.51s -> 15017.50s]  What is this? I don't understand what the problem is. All right. Get me the fuck over here. I need
[15017.50s -> 15030.97s]  food. He's still here somewhere. Is there a cave behind the waterfall? Follow me. Pick up the orb.
[15032.18s -> 15042.14s]  Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick. Pick it up. What the fuck are you doing?
[15043.11s -> 15051.69s]  Pick up the orb. Why can't I get the orb? You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[15056.70s -> 15066.15s]  Please. It's in the background. So was I being lied to about the orb?
[15068.33s -> 15080.62s]  Why is it in my face? It's like eclipsing me. Okay. You explain to me what happened here.
[15096.28s -> 15101.82s]  Eat this. Eat this. Eat it. What is this? Eat it. I can't eat it. Where are my friends?
[15102.78s -> 15106.38s]  Where's food? I need food right now. Like I need to eat something right now.
[15109.82s -> 15130.74s]  Fucking tiger spawned in next to the lake. I can't eat this. All right. What is that? Food.
[15130.74s -> 15135.83s]  I'm fucking believing. Okay. I need to change. I need to switch to you or something.
[15136.63s -> 15146.92s]  My bone is healed, but I'm still I need to go. I need the that thing up there. I can't believe
[15147.64s -> 15157.94s]  that I got like a server admin spawned a fucking tiger in on the lake. I need to like find
[15158.58s -> 15167.40s]  one of those things, but I can't carry anything. So you get a tiger spawned up your ass and then
[15167.40s -> 15172.76s]  the tiger kills everybody. And then you have to run around like an asshole trying to find like
[15172.76s -> 15192.54s]  the fruit hanging from the tree to peel your broken bones and shit. I'm going out. I'm going out. I'm
[15192.54s -> 15202.47s]  going out. I'm going out. I'm going out. Okay. I'm alive. What are you doing? Give it to me.
[15203.19s -> 15225.29s]  We even brought stuff with us. This game. Seriously. Is anybody else hurt? We need to go to
[15225.29s -> 15246.14s]  bed now. I would love to put a shut up shop next to the waterfall. Come here. Who else is injured?
[15246.70s -> 15256.02s]  I can't really tell from here. Can everybody get up here? Is it just the two of us? I'm just
[15256.02s -> 15260.50s]  going to bring two of them with me because there's one more here, right? Where did I get them both?
[15261.46s -> 15285.08s]  I literally as if there's a tiger here, I'm going to uninstall the game. Go get the orb. I'm not
[15285.08s -> 15291.64s]  going to get the fucking orb. There is a tiger here like hiding in that bush. Is it in the rock?
[15292.44s -> 15312.94s]  That's how you regain your sanity. Well, I chased one around for 30 seconds and it just
[15312.94s -> 15319.94s]  glitched into my screen. If you don't get the orb, you go insane. Well, why did it not work last time?
[15327.22s -> 15342.65s]  Reach conquer zone. Didn't I already do this though? What the fuck are you? What the fuck are you
[15342.65s -> 15375.78s]  talking about? Like it's like inside. Where is this? Every fucking time. Every time. Every single
[15375.78s -> 15385.10s]  fucking time. Come on. Who's hurt? And then I'm going to, we're going to have to put a,
[15385.10s -> 15396.26s]  we're going to make a little camp back here. So if you go outside of the waterfall, all of a sudden,
[15396.26s -> 15400.02s]  you've lost your mind again. No, don't go out of there. It's, it's not safe out there.
[15422.25s -> 15433.11s]  What the fuck is this talking about? I don't understand this. I have to conquer my fear
[15434.15s -> 15464.12s]  of, of over there now. The water is scary. How far away is this? I don't. Okay. Is this it?
[15464.76s -> 15482.82s]  I got it. Conquer your fear. Conquer your fear. Please eat something. Who's hurt?
[15483.70s -> 15487.88s]  Anybody with blood on them? How are you doing? You all right? I think you got blood on you.
[15488.60s -> 15493.93s]  Come here. We need to eat. This is the worst game I've ever played in my whole life.
[15494.97s -> 15500.49s]  This is the worst game ever. This game, this, this is probably, this is like up there,
[15500.49s -> 15516.87s]  like top five worst games I've ever played. He wasn't even here. He's not even here.
[15519.72s -> 15555.86s]  He just spawned. This is like the fucking slender man. How do I attack? I swear to God.
[15560.14s -> 15565.66s]  It's not fair. I was just, he's, somebody has fucking cheats.
[15568.66s -> 15577.14s]  I've conquered my fear of water. Let's drink some.
[15607.24s -> 15613.88s]  Is he drinking too fast? Okay. Where are the babies? Thank God. The babies are safe
[15615.82s -> 15625.78s]  or at least one of them is. Okay. Let me, I need to, I need to sleep. I need to, I need to. Hey,
[15625.78s -> 15637.56s]  look, now guess what I have to fucking do. I think the tiger's here again. Did you hear that shit?
[15647.16s -> 15652.84s]  I have, I have to go get one of those sky fruits because I'm bleeding now.
[15654.86s -> 15660.87s]  And when I go to get a sky fruit, I'm going to get attacked again. And then it's going to eat
[15660.87s -> 15673.75s]  three people. And then I'm going to have to get another sky fruit and then just leave the area.
[15673.75s -> 15681.10s]  That's what I tried to do. And then tiger spawn. I was very clearly, I looked at every direction
[15681.10s -> 15684.70s]  and the tiger wasn't there. And then all of a sudden, I, sorry, I picked up the fourth notebook
[15684.70s -> 15695.35s]  page. So he comes faster and there's no, none of those things around. I might as well just die.
[15696.30s -> 15699.10s]  Just somebody, all right, I'm going to turn around and just hit me in the back of the fucking head
[15699.10s -> 15712.23s]  as hard as you can with that thing. And then eat me. Some, just eat me. All of you. Sometimes
[15712.23s -> 15745.59s]  you have to make sacrifices. Give this to me. Let's make a camp. Who cares where it is? No,
[15745.59s -> 15767.96s]  get out of the fucking way. Oh, Jeff, those gators. All right, can I stomp on this yet? Hey,
[15767.96s -> 15773.67s]  oh, I wonder what it is. Is it a tiger? Hey, was I just looking in that direction and there was no
[15773.67s -> 15782.44s]  fucking tiger. Does anybody have a spear? Give me that thing. Give me that spear.
[15783.16s -> 15791.16s]  Give me that fucking thing right now. Come here. Give me the spear. No, stop running. Give me the
[15791.16s -> 15798.09s]  spear. You give me that spear. I need that. Give it to me quickly. Oh, he's dead. So I'm going to
[15798.09s -> 15806.86s]  get the spear anyways. Spear. Okay, here we go. How do you counter attack? What happened to my
[15806.86s -> 15826.58s]  hands anymore? Where the fuck is it? It's on my hands. I just picked it up. Was he smashing?
[15832.25s -> 15842.81s]  He was just hitting something on the ground. I don't know what he was hitting. He was smashing
[15842.81s -> 15855.91s]  somethings at it. Was he killing another monkey? I don't know. Oh, hey guys. I was
[15855.91s -> 15867.91s]  fancy seeing you all here. He made it back. Hold A. Okay, I held A but the problem was I
[15867.91s -> 15888.52s]  dropped the spear. Hold A. That's what I did. No, you pressed A. They've made it X or like
[15889.32s -> 15898.87s]  right trigger or any other button besides A. They couldn't have done it like B.
[15898.87s -> 15956.23s]  Everybody's bleeding. So let's go across the map to find another one of those healing scrubs
[15966.33s -> 16004.44s]  and the cycle repeats itself. Do I have any spears or anything? Reaction time for attacks
[16004.44s -> 16025.40s]  will be increased. Oh, sure. Hold A to prime dodging or attack. Move left stick to choose
[16025.40s -> 16054.26s]  direction. Release A at the right time to dodge or attack. Okay, so dodge towards them to attack
[16054.26s -> 16065.29s]  but that's been dodging. I've been dodging like towards these motherfuckers. I just got
[16065.29s -> 16072.65s]  $50 from Phylacter Lich. Thank you. I'm glad you have a Wendy's nearby or you'd be fucking dead.
[16084.26s -> 16089.30s]  No, give me a break though. Could be like hold A and then tap forward and let go of A.
[16089.94s -> 16093.78s]  Why can't I just have like an animation where I fucking bash the motherfucker with like X?
[16094.58s -> 16121.24s]  What is this like QTE thing? Thank you for the $50. Is there a sound cue? I don't know.
[16123.35s -> 16133.38s]  But I can take care of my own food. Trust me on that. I know how to cook two things. I know how
[16133.38s -> 16139.43s]  to make a hamburger all the way to well done because I'm too scared to take it off any other
[16139.43s -> 16144.39s]  point because I think I'll get sick and I know how to make a delicious salmon in the oven.
[16145.03s -> 16148.63s]  You just put a piece of salmon in the oven with some with some fucking spices and seasoning and
[16148.63s -> 16152.23s]  some some you put the water sauce and shit all over it and you put it in the oven for like 10-12
[16152.23s -> 16159.03s]  minutes you know you can't fuck it up you just take it out and eat it. I also know how to make
[16159.03s -> 16166.52s]  spaghetti al dente. It's four minutes although I do have to be careful because one time I did make
[16166.52s -> 16172.60s]  my famous crunchy al dente spaghetti for a family get-together and four people chipped their teeth.
[16173.48s -> 16178.28s]  And I'm still dealing with that family lawsuit to this day so I gotta be careful. I gotta be
[16178.28s -> 16191.06s]  more aware. Anyways thanks for the 50 bucks and thank you Great Canadian FK Club for the 10 subs.
[16191.06s -> 16202.55s]  Appreciate it. Hold A to prime to dodge or attack. Move left stick to choose a direction. Let go at
[16202.55s -> 16210.20s]  A at the right time to dodge or counter attack. I am just gonna go kill something. I'm ready.
[16210.92s -> 16219.13s]  Next step and more just yeah. This is what happened. This is what happened to me.
[16219.85s -> 16224.89s]  Everybody thought I was lying. Everybody thought I was a liar. I dodged and I dropped my fucking axe.
[16224.89s -> 16228.81s]  Once connected the chance of dropping an item when a dodge happens it will decrease. I dodged and it
[16228.81s -> 16241.37s]  dropped the fucking axe on the ground. Like what was I supposed to do? I don't have enough power
[16241.37s -> 16255.64s]  yet. All right I want that. I want that to follow in future generations. There's an audio cue for
[16255.72s -> 16259.16s]  counter-attacking. You have to do it towards the enemy. What's with the fucking audio cues?
[16266.57s -> 16277.69s]  Phylactery Lich gave another 50 dollars. What am I doing? Everybody go home. I have four holes in
[16277.69s -> 16316.02s]  my body. They didn't make it. They didn't make it. I sent them all home. They fucking died in front
[16316.02s -> 16343.96s]  of me. I think they're standing on top of me. All right it's just you and me and you. I need a
[16343.96s -> 16352.39s]  spear or something. Give me that. I need to heal. Is this thing sharpened? It is not. Thank God
[16352.39s -> 16358.39s]  there's somebody still alive. All right give me the rock. Here we go. I'm not I am not fucking
[16358.39s -> 16368.26s]  around now. I'm gonna do this restart. What do you mean restart?
[16382.62s -> 16390.54s]  We're going and we're killing us. A lion and the expedition. I just did. I just didn't. They all
[16390.54s -> 16406.89s]  died. I already did the expedition. Yeah there are too many bodies lying around in bones.
[16407.85s -> 16424.20s]  Okay now I have to go get one of those things. Let's go. Hurry up. Eat the other bodies. I can't
[16424.20s -> 16443.42s]  do that. Why do these things have to be so far away from where I am? Evolve. Evolve. All right
[16443.42s -> 16463.75s]  I'm evolving. Fuck it. I got two kids here. Evolve. I'm done. Keep that acute response and I think
[16463.75s -> 16470.34s]  that's all I can do right now. Evolve. Change generation. Let's go. I got nothing else I can
[16470.34s -> 16495.29s]  put it in. Let's go. Yeah go. I got two kids but file actor thank you for the hundred bucks.
[16496.09s -> 16503.78s]  Thank you for real. That's a shitload of money and a great Canadian FK club. Thanks both of you.
[16503.78s -> 16533.62s]  Another 15 years. Okay we're in year 35. How are we doing? Okay we're good. We need to have some
[16533.62s -> 16544.94s]  more kids. Everybody with bones? No. Okay give me my I need a spear. I'm gonna go try to kill
[16544.94s -> 16562.52s]  something. This is gonna take a while. I hope I'm not the only one alive. No there are at least a
[16562.52s -> 16577.19s]  couple other here. All right here we go. I'm going to get one of these. There's one. Just I'm gonna
[16577.19s -> 16588.55s]  just have them at the base. I'm gonna go pick them up. Just go get them. Nobody follow me. I'm just
[16588.55s -> 16601.70s]  gonna do it by myself. How come you're not taking the spear that you made 15 years ago?
[16602.50s -> 16614.66s]  It's dull. All right where am I going to keep going up? Where the hell were those?
[16617.08s -> 16621.16s]  There's eggs up there. Maybe we should get those too. No it's just a branch.
[16623.08s -> 16637.74s]  What about this? Is this like a new species of plant or something? Bird? Can I like identify
[16637.74s -> 16660.15s]  the bird? Let's go up here. These have to be so high up. You can't just put these like I'm like
[16660.15s -> 16668.42s]  around. I hate me. Consume the bird? I don't think I can do that.
[16725.56s -> 16730.04s]  You just like sometimes you just have to like take a leap of faith to and I'm gonna die. I'm
[16730.04s -> 16736.90s]  gonna fall off and die probably. I just was trying to get this shit and sometimes it's hard to tell
[16736.90s -> 16741.30s]  what's even grabbable and what's not grabbable. Like I can't grab those. I can't I can only grab
[16741.30s -> 16743.54s]  the vines. I can grab the trunks. I can grab the branches.
[16755.32s -> 16763.08s]  I don't even like fucking remember where like just I'm gonna just go all the way to the top
[16763.08s -> 16771.85s]  of the damn tree. This is an Assassin's Creed. It was made by the same guy that made Assassin's
[16771.85s -> 16811.80s]  Creed. It may as well be. Give me that. How can I stand? Do I have to sleep to cure a broken bone?
[16812.36s -> 16820.47s]  Fuck you bird. I almost got him.
[16826.38s -> 16830.54s]  Give me the other one. I have two of these things now. That's all I wanted.
[16860.33s -> 16862.41s]  The red or green plant will heal bones.
[16868.30s -> 16872.46s]  Where can I find one of those? I guess I'm just gonna have to. I want just to bring these back to
[16872.54s -> 16909.53s]  have at the camp. I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. There's one over there. This game we go with
[16909.53s -> 16917.74s]  multiplayer. I've been playing for about five hours. I still don't understand what the fuck the
[16917.74s -> 16924.70s]  point of the game is. What am I supposed to what do you mean that you just you just exist?
[16929.48s -> 16954.01s]  Just live? To evolve? Into what? Become a caveman? Is that even in the game?
[16960.71s -> 16978.15s]  No. What do you mean no? Are you just a monkey the whole time?
[16988.46s -> 16995.56s]  Yes. No. No. Yeah. No. We're getting some 50-50 responses here.
[16997.90s -> 16999.18s]  All right. Here's the red thing that I wanted.
[17016.86s -> 17027.00s]  Is this working? What's wrong with me?
[17027.72s -> 17085.54s]  My phone is re-broken. I'm just trying to fix myself and and I'm poisoned from the berries.
[17086.34s -> 17115.94s]  What happened? To evolve? I don't have any children guys. Who even is this and where are they?
[17118.94s -> 17131.85s]  That was kind of sad. Yeah it was. Restart the game with your knowledge of how to play.
[17137.05s -> 17157.91s]  Should I just do that? But I'm not sure I have that much knowledge on how to play the game.
[17157.91s -> 17163.90s]  I didn't understand. I don't think I have the knowledge you're you're referring to.
[17185.83s -> 17193.62s]  Read the no I I know like the basic understanding but should I just restart?
[17195.29s -> 17202.28s]  Read the help section? No I I know all we mean we did this already.
[17213.38s -> 17226.22s]  Yeah like I understand this stuff. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Okay when you access the
[17226.22s -> 17229.26s]  Neural Engineering development you use the Neural Engineering by surviving to grow the neurons.
[17229.26s -> 17233.66s]  Okay it will increase your capacities. When you access your neural network ready for reinforcement
[17233.66s -> 17245.05s]  it means you can pass generations right? Okay but I already knew that. The problem has not been
[17245.05s -> 17248.65s]  about progressing in the game. The problem has been running into tigers that spawn on top of me.
[17264.87s -> 17285.85s]  The combat page? The combat page is two sentences. Hold A to prime dodging. Release A. What do you
[17285.93s -> 17306.14s]  mean? I just read them. I know I already knew that shit. What's that?
[17312.63s -> 17370.57s]  What's your enemy? A boar? I ain't giving up. Not yet. Nope. I ain't giving up. Who died over there?
[17370.57s -> 17392.46s]  Okay there's somebody died there. I can already read the patch notes for version 1.1.
[17392.46s -> 17396.31s]  Reduce the spawn rate of the tiger by like 30 fucking thousand percent.
[17397.18s -> 17425.77s]  This is the last one. This is the only monkey I have left.
[17429.48s -> 17434.52s]  Hold and release. I'm gonna ban the word. I'm gonna ban the word hold and release.
[17435.96s -> 17440.76s]  I didn't have a spirit in my hand and by the way even I'm banning the word. I'm banning hold and
[17440.76s -> 17461.93s]  release. Hold and release does not stop the fact that I'm surrounded by there are more tigers than
[17461.93s -> 17489.77s]  people. There's another monkey over there I think. Found him. Hey you. Follow me. You and me are
[17489.77s -> 17499.96s]  friends now. You understand? Let's go. People are donating to say that. Don't even do that. That's
[17499.96s -> 17510.06s]  that's a waste of money. Don't do that. Okay follow me. Uh there's two of us. Wait what are
[17510.06s -> 17516.14s]  you? Are you female? Male? Am I male? Are you female? What is it? Let me know. I'm doing this.
[17516.14s -> 17527.40s]  I'm starting over in mid-game. Come here. What are you? Male. What am I? Who am I? What am I?
[17533.18s -> 17541.54s]  Shit. No wait. That's good. Right? Yes. It's good. Come here. Yes. Come here.
[17543.64s -> 17546.28s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[17546.28s -> 17564.46s]  We can start over. We can do this. You and I. Come on. No. I'm trying to turn off the emote only mode.
[17564.46s -> 17596.98s]  How do I turn? I don't. I know how to turn it on. I don't turn it off. Got it. Okay. Now I need a bed.
[17598.57s -> 17601.93s]  Okay. We already got some stuff here. There's a stick. There's sticks here.
[17603.53s -> 17612.78s]  I see a couple of rocks. I just want to make a bed. Or no. Just follow me back. We're already
[17612.78s -> 17631.99s]  here. There's one, two, three, four dead up there. So many dead people up here. This doesn't feel
[17631.99s -> 17636.63s]  right. I don't think I can. I don't think we can like have kids up here. This doesn't feel right.
[17637.35s -> 17687.90s]  Okay. Evolve first. Didn't I already do that? Like I'm talking like an hour like 45 minutes ago now.
[17687.90s -> 17725.48s]  Didn't I do that already? Because I don't have any points. I can't reach here. No. I have nothing
[17725.48s -> 17732.84s]  else to do. I need to like survive out there with kids around me. But surviving out there
[17732.84s -> 17756.58s]  has deemed to be very, very, very difficult. Evolution leap. What? What is this? When evolving
[17756.58s -> 17760.90s]  through ages, all spontaneous mutation neurons are not carried by adults or elves but vanish.
[17760.90s -> 17763.70s]  But then matter may reappear in future babies. Do you still want to evolve?
[17764.34s -> 17791.86s]  Just what the fuck even is this? What? What? What? What? There was nothing told me about that.
[17791.94s -> 17808.95s]  Zero. Did not tell me to do this. 24,000 fucking years. 24,000 more years. Obsidian is a tool.
[17808.95s -> 17829.53s]  I used it twice. I intimidated a warthog. We gained 50,000 years. Is there a reason why the game
[17829.53s -> 17844.12s]  would not tell you that this existed? It's going too fast. Oh shit. I'm gonna be sick.
[17844.68s -> 17862.49s]  I would... I even looked at this screen and I thought these were just like achievements. Dude,
[17862.49s -> 17865.29s]  I don't... This is happening. There's too much happening on the screen right now. I don't know
[17865.29s -> 17875.72s]  what's going on. It's almost a million years. The game doesn't tell you mechanics so you learn?
[17876.52s -> 17884.47s]  I don't think this is a game mechanic. I think this is a menu option. Game mechanic would be
[17884.47s -> 17892.62s]  like finding herbs and spices and shit. I think this is a very important screen to know
[17892.70s -> 17921.75s]  what it does. This is five hours of stuff.
[17934.97s -> 17947.46s]  You've 102,000 evolved faster than science. I went 819,000 years. What? Hey, wait, that's not fair.
[17954.92s -> 17959.88s]  Evolving slow. Okay, more deaths than births. So that means you don't exist.
[17968.58s -> 17972.74s]  You have moved forward through time to nine to four million, whatever, years before now,
[17972.74s -> 17983.67s]  and will be brought back to the world to catch up with your lineage. That is an insanely important
[17983.67s -> 18010.34s]  fucking core game that not... Well, you didn't know it existed either. Neither did I. Why is
[18010.34s -> 18040.46s]  it year 36? Did anything change? Who am I? Anybody here? Is it just... Am I the only one that made it?
[18041.10s -> 18062.62s]  Where's my bed? Okay, who are you? Adult female. All right, I...
[18065.99s -> 18090.76s]  I'm going out on my own. New thing. I can't fucking believe I was there for five hours
[18090.84s -> 18096.82s]  and didn't know. I can't believe it. I am fucking... I'm shocked right now.
[18097.78s -> 18127.88s]  All right, get the honey. Get it. How do I get honey? Oh, okay. I got some more senses. Can you
[18127.88s -> 18136.38s]  grab it? I don't think you can grab honey. You need to do a couple more feats to evolve as a
[18136.38s -> 18144.66s]  species, okay? So let's just grab a few sticks and do the thing I did already. Strip the weeds.
[18146.50s -> 18150.58s]  I know how to... No, I don't know how to do that apparently. All right, what do I want to do?
[18150.58s -> 18167.99s]  I need to go over here, find one of these other things. Let's go this way. Okay, I'm going to
[18167.99s -> 18184.76s]  find the evolved tiger. Yeah, that shit was un-fucking-believable. Oh, you okay? I need to
[18184.76s -> 18198.44s]  help you. I got a headache. What can I do for a headache? Something for a headache? That's not
[18198.44s -> 18205.19s]  food. You're looking for war or something. I need to...
[18250.52s -> 18313.93s]  I can't. What do I do? Why is he still alive? Get off of him. Run away, you idiot. Stupid dumb
[18313.93s -> 18374.41s]  tiger. Is he all right? What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, guys? I'm just going to remember.
[18374.41s -> 18411.11s]  Can I not climb up any of this? All right, I did my... Did it work? It worked from this far away.
[18414.18s -> 18418.10s]  Okay, let me... Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is fruits and shit. I need to heal.
[18418.74s -> 18432.81s]  I think I need a rock to break these open. I don't think I can just eat these. I'm pretty
[18432.81s -> 18440.02s]  sure I can't. Where did they even go? No, I can't. Okay, I'm going to bring these. We're
[18440.02s -> 18446.38s]  going to smash it with a rock. I'm going to give them to him because the tiger's gone. Where are
[18446.38s -> 18461.77s]  the other two that fell? Right here? These things. Okay, I got one, apparently. Where?
[18474.87s -> 18478.31s]  I'm bleeding out. I know, but I have to go get one of these fucking things.
[18479.43s -> 18509.53s]  It's a story of my life. No fall joke? No. You healed yourself from bleeding. That's a feat.
[18509.53s -> 18527.40s]  I need like a couple more feats. Can I break this open? Metabolism. What exactly am I doing
[18527.40s -> 18544.87s]  with this? Oh, this is the nut. It's a big nut. Let's break this open and eat it. It's a coconut.
[18544.87s -> 18555.05s]  Okay, can I do anything else with this? Can I? I think I do have to smash this with a rock,
[18555.05s -> 18571.56s]  I think. Yeah, okay, I can smash it with a rock. Is he still alive? Tiger's gone, right?
[18572.94s -> 18591.16s]  Give me a rock so I can break this open. Any rock will do. Any rock will do. I'll take any rock in
[18591.16s -> 18599.14s]  the whole world and on earth. Any rock will do. I wish I could pick you up. I need a rock
[18599.86s -> 18622.20s]  so I can give this to you. I wish I could put like something. I wish I had like a monkey inventory
[18623.24s -> 18640.30s]  because now I gotta find a rock. Give me, please. He's really hungry. Right here. No, those are
[18640.30s -> 18675.61s]  mushrooms. Just eat them. No, don't eat those. Oh, hold on. Berries. Are these poisonous? Hey,
[18675.61s -> 18683.22s]  I learned self-control. I would have loved to give you a berry, but that guy said I'm gonna
[18683.22s -> 18709.62s]  have to leave him. Just put everything down and fucking get out of here. I can't even get up the
[18709.62s -> 18729.43s]  fucking tree. Climb the tree. I'm learning dodge. Well, that's good. I'm just farming points.
[18729.43s -> 18755.83s]  Whatever, we got a stream drop? We're good. Guess what I need now? I need another one of those
[18755.83s -> 18767.32s]  things to rub on my fucking body. And he's just guarding this fucking tiger. This is always around
[18767.32s -> 18773.08s]  no matter what you do or where you go. There's always a tiger. There's always a fucking tiger.
[18773.08s -> 18777.24s]  And tigers come out like for five minutes a day, guys. They don't fucking do this.
[18778.68s -> 18802.25s]  And then they go to stay asleep. I have no like depth here. What am I looking at? What are you
[18802.25s -> 18804.73s]  looking at? What are you looking at? What are you looking at? What are you looking at? What are you
[18804.73s -> 18815.66s]  looking at? What? Oh, it's been a whole day. Okay. Is he still just down? Of course he's down there.
[18816.30s -> 18833.27s]  Just always expect that there's always a tiger everywhere no matter what. This whole game is
[18833.27s -> 18850.49s]  tigers. Ancestors. Monkeys ran away from tigers based on four bones we found. Okay, can I heal
[18850.49s -> 18864.86s]  this guy? That's not gonna hurt me, right? Thank God. Okay, come here, please. What the fuck was
[18864.86s -> 18875.67s]  that? What just happened? What happened? How did my character die? I wasn't bleeding. I just healed
[18875.67s -> 18893.29s]  myself. I just healed myself. I'm just trying. All right, no more rescuing other people.
[18901.38s -> 18948.36s]  The tiger shot me. God damn it. Well, I... Shit. Your circle was so minuscule that the act of walking
[18948.44s -> 18956.55s]  killed you. Oh, that sucks. Is this water? Let me just drink some of this fucking water.
[18959.99s -> 18971.83s]  You get zero xp unless you have a baby on your back. Am I scared of the water too? What is it?
[18971.83s -> 18982.98s]  What am I looking at here? Lily pads? Are you scared of lily pads? No, it's a fishing spot.
[18982.98s -> 19006.87s]  So what's the problem? Relax. All right, where... Let me go over here. I'm just gonna sleep.
[19007.59s -> 19017.99s]  Do I have a thing here? This is where he spawned. Is there a bed?
[19020.63s -> 19023.27s]  All right, am I gonna have to make one?
[19033.72s -> 19037.56s]  Stay in the trees? Well, I would love to stay in the trees, but half the stuff I have to do,
[19037.56s -> 19051.98s]  I have to be on the ground. Dig in this hole. Pick up this rock. Grab a stick off the plant.
[19052.54s -> 19082.39s]  Okay, I can dig. I can dig. I need a stick. I also need to go to sleep somewhere.
[19087.11s -> 19092.25s]  I don't even know where the hell that even is. I guess I have a camp somewhere.
[19093.37s -> 19100.63s]  I'm here. Might as well put it on the... Whatever. Just sleep on the floor? Let me go.
[19100.63s -> 19117.22s]  There's like other people. There's like apes over here. Where is this other person on the map?
[19118.34s -> 19127.00s]  Who the fuck is this? Where are you? Are you just lying? Oh, you're like camouflaged. It's a baby.
[19127.00s -> 19167.99s]  Come here. All right, baby. Time to learn. What do I want to do now? I'm teaching the baby about
[19167.99s -> 19199.24s]  the world. Okay, so this is... I don't know. I don't think I have anybody left. I need to find
[19199.24s -> 19204.62s]  somebody. So here's how the course of action is going to be. Find somebody that's in need of a
[19204.62s -> 19211.98s]  new clan. Start the process of getting to know them, and then we both die by a tiger in 10
[19211.98s -> 19215.82s]  seconds. So let's just continue the same cycle we've been doing for the last two and a half hours.
[19230.71s -> 19238.52s]  Sounds good to me. Let's get a rock and make this a spear, and then we have to go find something.
[19238.52s -> 19273.58s]  I need to sleep too. Get off the tree. Sharp. I need a rock. Teach the baby about taxes.
[19274.95s -> 19280.10s]  I think we're just going to sleep somewhere. Can I sleep in a tree? I didn't want to do that.
[19280.82s -> 19299.90s]  We can't just sleep all the way up there. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to find a place to sleep.
[19300.46s -> 19321.62s]  I have to sleep in the bird's nest. Now I gotta find sticks, make a bed, or go up and sleep. And
[19321.62s -> 19339.46s]  let me try to sleep in a tree. Can I like just find a spot where we can lie down? I don't think so.
[19340.10s -> 19356.82s]  I have to make a bed. Make the bed on the tree. That's gonna be pain in the ass because I have
[19356.82s -> 19362.10s]  to bring individual... two individual sticks up here. Like five of them, and then stomp on it.
[19362.82s -> 19371.22s]  But I'll try. Well, there's a rock. I need that.
[19399.99s -> 19414.90s]  While I do this, don't pass out. All right, I got a weapon. I need some sticks.
[19417.66s -> 19429.91s]  Rocks. No sticks. No, like, leaves. I need to eat something too. I got... let's go find it.
[19438.39s -> 19443.43s]  Go tiger hunting. It's revenge time. I'm not going to kill that tiger. There's not a chance
[19443.43s -> 19452.33s]  in hell. Okay, right here. Put down a branch. Give me another one. Is there any more? That's
[19452.33s -> 19477.93s]  the only thing that was here? Come on. Tiger joke waiting room. Yeah, don't worry. You'll see it
[19477.93s -> 19511.37s]  again. Give me fish. Switching hands every time. It's just... what the hell? Why would you? Why do
[19511.37s -> 19528.47s]  I have to switch fucking hands for everything? I can't do this with my other hand? If I could do
[19528.47s -> 19531.83s]  it with my right hand, why would I not be smart enough to know I could do the same thing with my
[19531.83s -> 19557.62s]  other hand? Because it's dumb. All right. Okay, where is my right-handed? Yeah, I mean, like,
[19557.62s -> 19575.24s]  ultra right-handed. I want this. Is this ready? Keep that in the pile. It's not ready. I need,
[19575.24s -> 19610.57s]  like, one more. I can get that. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Wrong hand. Baby's hungry. Doesn't the baby eat
[19610.57s -> 19632.04s]  when you eat? Oh, I got rock. Here we go. A, up, and then let go of A.
[19681.75s -> 19695.99s]  Wait a minute. This is the final baby. I need to live. Climb something. Climb a tree.
[19713.70s -> 19732.14s]  Where is he? Why is it still doing this? Why are you doing this? The tiger cannot climb trees.
[19732.78s -> 19757.74s]  Speaking of trees, I need food. I need to eat something. I still hear the tiger screaming.
[19775.26s -> 19783.69s]  Find a hiding spot. I mean, I think this looks like a hiding spot to me.
[19784.33s -> 19812.62s]  Fucking orb is up here. Okay, so try and tell me that the orb is in the fucking sky. No,
[19812.62s -> 19823.67s]  I'm not jumping. No, I gotta find the monkey. He's pretty good. He's pretty good. He's pretty
[19823.67s -> 19861.21s]  strong. I heard the tiger. Just like in Dark Souls. Dark Souls 1. The tree. What are you doing? Let
[19861.21s -> 19879.51s]  go. Turn this way. I'm not even holding on to anything. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got
[19879.51s -> 19942.10s]  it. Tiger's still waiting for me down here. I'm looking for, like, a hiding spot or something.
[19951.14s -> 19998.81s]  I'm good. Okay, get up. That tiger is doing great. Yes, he is. Dead. Fish. Rock. Can I pick stuff up
[19998.81s -> 20016.82s]  as a baby? Holy shit, I can. Why can I do this? I can't strip it, though. Where's the... I can't.
[20017.38s -> 20024.31s]  I need somebody to do this for me. I gotta make a bed? No, I can't be on the ground for more than
[20024.31s -> 20066.60s]  fucking 30 seconds, otherwise... The bed was over here. Can I sleep into an adult? Why did I go back
[20066.60s -> 20111.82s]  here? If I die, the game ends. Yeah, I think I'm all right with that. No, wrong item. I can't pick
[20111.82s -> 20131.59s]  up the fucking spear. I'm trying to pick the spear up. I got it. I got the spear. No, this... No.
[20132.15s -> 20141.86s]  Every button is fucking A. Pick up, jump, run, fall down. No way. I don't even know where it went.
[20141.86s -> 20163.53s]  I want to just grab the spear and see if I can stab him. This is like... No, this is like...
[20196.60s -> 20214.97s]  You can't fight a tiger as a baby. What with my options? Where does this start? I just seen that
[20214.97s -> 20225.54s]  on Planet Earth. Yeah, I've never seen a... Never mind. No, I'm just a fucking baby again.
[20227.18s -> 20273.22s]  This ain't happening. Come on, motherfucker. Let's go. What you got? This is my last stand. Okay,
[20273.22s -> 20288.07s]  so hold A, towards him, audio cue, let go of A. I probably should know what this does first.
[20289.32s -> 20375.43s]  As a baby. No, I know what this is. I saw dad do this. There he is. Damn it. First time?
[20380.28s -> 20405.90s]  Custom game? Region? The jungle? Settlement? Rockslide? Oasis? Clan size? Medium? Okay.
[20406.82s -> 20426.23s]  Delete tigers. What is easy mode? I don't even know what that means. Find yourself alone somewhere
[20426.23s -> 20444.55s]  in Africa 10 million years ago. Let's try this one. No, no, not this one. One guy told me to pick
[20444.55s -> 20459.03s]  this. This is hardcore. Okay. Well, no, I ain't fucking doing that. I just quit the whole game,
[20459.03s -> 20482.28s]  actually. For the best. We're going to play something else. Rage quit? No, my entire lineage
[20482.28s -> 20510.46s]  was killed. That's not a rage quit. That's like a, I was wiped out. Go play WoW Classic. Oh no,
[20510.46s -> 20520.09s]  no way. I'm going to play that right now. Let me go, let me go get a drink. Let me pee and we'll
[20520.09s -> 20521.61s]  do something else for a little while. I'll be back.
