[2.81s -> 8.95s]  Welcome to the fucking real meat and potatoes of this one. This is Hivemind. So how this works,
[8.95s -> 18.34s]  this was made by somebody in this community. Did they put their, uh, did they put their, oh I gotta,
[18.34s -> 26.89s]  I gotta refresh the page. They were gonna put their, the social media down there. Did they?
[26.89s -> 33.30s]  But anyways, uh, it's, there's so many, yeah, that's how many tabs I had open.
[33.30s -> 44.57s]  Hivemind is family feud in a browser. This is genius. It's hivemind.fyi. I am going to host a
[44.57s -> 50.41s]  game and here's how this is going to work. I'm going to send you a link to the chat and we're,
[50.41s -> 55.48s]  we, this is a test. We're going to see if we can have an absolute shitload of people use this.
[55.48s -> 62.71s]  The site might just explode. Uh, we don't know. But we've, it's been scaled up and I'm going to
[62.71s -> 65.83s]  give you a link. You click the link. You just, all you have to do is click the link. You don't have
[65.83s -> 71.58s]  to do anything else. And I am going, you're going to get a series of questions on, well,
[71.58s -> 76.73s]  I'll give you an example. So you're going to get two questions a round. There's five rounds.
[76.73s -> 80.81s]  It's going to say, hey, like, uh, name something that, uh, you put on your head.
[81.54s -> 87.14s]  And one word answers, guys, because it's going to take the top six answers that people said,
[87.14s -> 94.90s]  the top eight, and I'm going to have to guess what you guys did. Over the course of five rounds,
[94.90s -> 100.65s]  there's a lightning round at the end. The second question is for the lightning round. By the way,
[100.65s -> 106.55s]  um, because there's so many people doing this, don't worry. It's not like it's going to be like,
[107.19s -> 112.07s]  uh, name something that flies. Dick ass, penis, dick, dick. Like it's, and you're not going to
[112.07s -> 115.67s]  show up on stream. I just want to make that clear. Uh, it has to be like potentially thousands of
[115.67s -> 122.94s]  you have to say the exact same thing. So it doesn't matter leaking the lobby. It doesn't matter
[122.94s -> 128.30s]  because you're just going to click on the link anyways. Let's see if this works. Let's try this
[128.30s -> 134.73s]  out. Derma, what Derma, why did you say that? Why did you say that shit? Why did you say that shit?
[134.73s -> 141.46s]  What? That doesn't matter. Here we go. You ready? I'm going to give you a link. I'm going to host a
[141.46s -> 145.45s]  game. Here we'll read it. Hi, mine is a game where you try to guess how a group of people would
[145.45s -> 149.13s]  answer a question. When a game starts, there will be a link that you can share with your friends.
[149.13s -> 152.73s]  You'll then be shown a series of questions and you will have to guess your friend's top answers to
[152.73s -> 160.01s]  earn points. Pretty sick. So I don't know what you guys are writing, obviously. Let's see how this
[160.01s -> 166.60s]  works. Hosting a game now. Join the game here. And if you'll take a look, you'll see the, it'll,
[166.60s -> 171.13s]  it'll show how many people are actually here. Let's actually copy this so you guys can actually go
[171.13s -> 181.00s]  here. Let's see what happens. Down here it says how many people are actually connected. Let's do
[181.00s -> 191.27s]  this. I'm going to start the game in a minute. 1200 people. 1300. This is, this is an insane
[191.27s -> 200.17s]  experiment by the way. I can't wait to see how this plays out. That link is this lobby.
[200.73s -> 211.30s]  Let's see if it crashes. I am going to cap this at, I'm just going to go eventually here. I'm
[211.30s -> 219.88s]  just going to click the button. So if you want to play, get in there. Close out of all the tabs.
[219.88s -> 235.72s]  No, I like living dangerously. Okay. I'm going to do it. There's 4100 people that want to play.
[235.72s -> 246.25s]  I'm ready to start the game. Oh, hold on. All right. You get five seconds. Wait, why are people
[246.25s -> 254.71s]  leaving? Hey, don't leave. Hey, why are you leaving? Don't leave. Wait, everybody's clicked off.
[254.71s -> 263.11s]  Everybody left. Okay, here we go. You're about to play five standard rounds. In each round,
[263.11s -> 266.87s]  you have 30 seconds for the hive line to be surveyed. Afterwards, you get a chance to guess the
[266.87s -> 271.67s]  tops, the top eight answers. Game starts in five seconds. You get 30 seconds to answer. Make it
[271.67s -> 280.31s]  simple. No sentences, one word, lowercase. Name a bad job for someone who is accident prone.
[280.31s -> 301.85s]  You have 25 seconds to answer. Sight broke. Kill it. Oh no. Dead link. Wait, let's see. Hold on.
[301.85s -> 321.32s]  Did it work? People in game refresh. Wait, I refresh? No, it's loading. It's loading. It's
[321.32s -> 328.84s]  loading. Hold on. I'm not going to touch anything. Here we go. Name a bad job for someone who is
[328.84s -> 362.18s]  accident prone. It's trying. Lowercase only. Wait, did I get it? Okay, wait. Name a bad
[362.18s -> 371.38s]  job for someone who is accident prone. A waiter. You killed it. You're getting an error message.
[372.10s -> 385.58s]  Oh wait, let me open up Discord and see if the dev is saying anything. Did I get it? No. This
[385.58s -> 391.86s]  was the stress test, by the way. He was like, you know what? Let's just dump a shitload of people
[391.86s -> 397.21s]  on here and see if this works. All right, hold on. Where's my Discord? Where's my Discord? Where's
[397.21s -> 414.98s]  my Discord? Where's my Discord? Hurry! Hold on. Okay, tell people to refresh if you're in here.
[414.98s -> 424.17s]  Refresh if you're in here. Okay, let me try waiter again. I'm the dev. What's up? No, you're not. I'm
[424.17s -> 432.98s]  talking to the dev over here. Maybe we should try again? Should I refresh the page? You couldn't
[432.98s -> 437.62s]  even answer? Oh, okay. All right. All right, let me start a new game. I'm going to cap it at a thousand
[437.62s -> 454.92s]  people, by the way. Wait, it's loading. Do the bar. Oh shit, that doesn't look good. Application error.
[454.92s -> 473.48s]  Check your logs. Communicating with hivemind. Applicat- Okay, I think we broke it. Hey, what
[473.48s -> 484.58s]  about that glungus test? Go back, it worked. Did I- Wait, did I do it? Too many people went on.
[484.58s -> 490.82s]  Too many people. All right, hold on. Let me do some communication in here. All right, I'm going to
[490.82s -> 503.35s]  have an idea. Here's my idea. You ready for my idea? I got 83 points? No, I didn't. This is- I'm
[503.35s -> 510.31s]  going to- This is a new link. I'm going to do a new link. It's working? I don't think it is. I'm stuck
[510.31s -> 522.73s]  here. What the fuck? Stay on. Uh, I'm kind of stuck here. I got 83 points? Uh-oh. I think- I
[522.73s -> 536.62s]  think we might have to- We might have to pivot to Chubby Bunny. New game. Let's try it again.
[541.00s -> 546.10s]  You know what? Let's not even link this shit. Like, there's probably like- I think 11,000 people
[546.10s -> 551.03s]  that are here. Probably 8,000 of you. This is- That's too much work. You'd be like, oh,
[552.63s -> 557.69s]  no. Never mind. I don't want it. I don't care. So, we're going to- We're going to- We're going to
[557.69s -> 566.15s]  cap it to 1,000. Let's see if it works. I'm capping it at 1,000. Let's see- Let's try that.
[566.71s -> 586.17s]  Okay, cap it now. Here we go. You have 30 seconds. Let's see if it works. Let's try it again.
[586.17s -> 591.90s]  Name something you do in front of a mirror. And this- By the way, the second question that
[591.90s -> 602.20s]  you're answering is for the lightning round at the end. I can't see it. Oh, it crashed. More data.
[602.20s -> 609.96s]  Give us more- Give us more data on how much people can connect. I think it's- I think it's
[609.96s -> 623.34s]  working. I think it's just slow. Okay, let's see what happens. Does it load? Let's see. It worked?
[627.35s -> 637.14s]  Name something you do in front of a mirror. I saw what somebody wrote and I can't- I can't even
[637.14s -> 643.99s]  fucking say what it was. Why would you do that? Why would you do that in front of a mirror?
[643.99s -> 652.65s]  You guys are disgusting. Ah, shit! All right. All right, we'll try it one more time. We'll
[652.65s -> 657.58s]  try it one more time. We're going to try it one more time. This time, I'm going to cap it at
[657.58s -> 668.71s]  two- at 500 people. We'll try it again. Here we go. Ready? Refresh. Refresh. Oh, wait, wait,
[668.71s -> 673.82s]  wait, wait, hold on. I'm pushing- I'm pushing some changes. It's probably going to be working
[673.82s -> 681.43s]  in five minutes. Hold on. It doesn't cap, by the way. Oh, okay. All right. Dev's pushing changes
[681.43s -> 685.85s]  right now. Refresh it now. Refresh, refresh, refresh. All right, all right, I'm going.
[685.85s -> 709.13s]  Okay, name something you do in front of a mirror. Flex. Flex in front of a mirror. It's thinking.
[710.28s -> 722.55s]  It's thinking. Hold on. Did I get it? Maybe I should play Chubby Bunny in between rounds.
[724.50s -> 745.59s]  Oh, nope. Hold on. Just don't exit. I'm not going anywhere. Bingo! It works! 175 people said flex.
[745.59s -> 753.58s]  I got it. All right. Name something you do in front of a mirror. I don't want to write
[753.58s -> 756.90s]  Zerk off, okay? You know the real one. Name something you do in front of a mirror.
[761.11s -> 775.67s]  Sing? People like sing into the mirror, don't they? Maybe? Do you sing in front of a mirror?
[777.11s -> 783.78s]  Do you cry in the mirror? Did that go through? Okay, here we go. Now, there we go. The loading
[783.78s -> 792.95s]  bar. I already guessed that. Oh, no, that was strike. I got it wrong. Okay, same thing. Something
[792.95s -> 795.99s]  to do in front of the mirror. Top eight answers. Some of these are just going to be so fucking
[795.99s -> 811.35s]  specific. Something you do in front of a mirror. Oh, we got to get the music back on. All right,
[811.35s -> 821.10s]  let's go. All right, what do you do in front of a mirror? Brush. Brush teeth. Make sure your answers
[821.10s -> 826.41s]  are simple as fuck, by the way. Don't write like, well, I get up in the morning and I make a coffee.
[826.41s -> 837.19s]  No, just one or two words. Lowercase. You said one word. Yeah, well, that's what I mean. Like,
[837.19s -> 849.10s]  make it simple. Like, if it's brush your teeth, it's brush teeth, not brush your teeth. I'm winning.
[849.10s -> 855.53s]  What's underneath flex? Okay, name something you do in front of a mirror. Flex. Brush teeth.
[859.58s -> 876.46s]  I don't want to write it, but I feel like you all said it. Flex. Brush teeth. Pop zits? Pop zits.
[876.46s -> 888.02s]  People like lean in and they, yes, they do. What do you mean what's wrong with you? Who does,
[888.02s -> 895.50s]  you do that. I know you do. He did that an hour ago. You still have the mark there.
[895.50s -> 911.86s]  Nope. Strike two. You guys don't like, yes, you fucking do. Uh, hair. Comb. Comb hair. You do,
[911.86s -> 920.44s]  clearly. It works. It actually, I mean, it's a little, it chugs along a little bit. It works.
[920.44s -> 930.78s]  Okay, I got it wrong. Okay, top answers were flex, pose, cry, brush teeth, masturbate, smile,
[930.78s -> 954.82s]  shave, and dance. Who zirks off into the mirror? Just answer the fucking question already and let's
[954.82s -> 960.01s]  memeify this. How many times have I leaned over and did that voice? How many times have I leaned
[960.01s -> 965.27s]  forward and said something? All right, what is it? Name something you do multiple times a day.
[970.25s -> 984.30s]  I know, okay, I'm gonna write it. I'm gonna write it. By the way, fucking gross. Let me refresh.
[984.30s -> 991.90s]  Holy shit, there's 8,200 people connected to this goddamn thing. I'm surprised it's still standing.
[991.90s -> 1014.06s]  The dev says I'm making rapid changes right now. Performance will improve soon. I mean, it's, it's,
[1014.06s -> 1021.48s]  I'm surprised this works. All right, come on, come on, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[1021.48s -> 1028.97s]  Did you guys answer? So many people are joining. Are you, did you answer, everybody answering?
[1028.97s -> 1052.73s]  Close my, it has nothing to do with my tabs. Oh, he said refresh. Okay, hold on. Come on,
[1052.73s -> 1067.05s]  Gwen. It's working. Yeah, this dev is a fucking superhero. 10,000 people connecting to this
[1067.05s -> 1071.93s]  thing at the same time and this guy's, this guy's got, this guy's got it on. All right, here we go.
[1071.93s -> 1079.02s]  Something you do multiple times a day. I have to write it. I have to. I have to write it. I don't
[1079.02s -> 1097.38s]  do that, but I have to write that. I don't want this on my screen for this long. Get it off.
[1097.38s -> 1126.25s]  All right, here we go. 500 of you fucking degenerates. I have to, it's gonna be at number
[1126.25s -> 1141.24s]  two. I got it. Okay, that's two. Names like you do multiple times a day. Um, but I don't want to
[1141.24s -> 1150.78s]  write the real one. You know what I mean? Yeah, like pee. Pee? Are you pee like, what, 10 times a
[1150.78s -> 1166.30s]  day? 15 times a day? Eat. Yeah, you do eat. Come on, give me the loading bar. Come on,
[1166.30s -> 1180.25s]  give me the loading bar. Drink more water. What do you mean? That's fucked. Stop getting answers from
[1180.25s -> 1198.57s]  chat. I'm not. This is my own, my own doing. I think we're bottlenecked. Oh, here we go.
[1205.03s -> 1215.70s]  I got zero strikes. There it is. All right, what else? I won't look over here. I promise.
[1215.70s -> 1224.89s]  Something you do multiple times a day. Eat. Everybody eats. You eat like fucking four times
[1224.89s -> 1228.81s]  a day. Three times a day. Two times a day. How, people eat all, people eat all kinds of different
[1228.81s -> 1235.83s]  times. Give me number three. There it is. Bam. Oh, I'm gonna, you guys are, it's over. I'm gonna win.
[1235.83s -> 1244.41s]  Okay, pee. 100 of you said pee. I think you do multiple times a day. Masturbate, zerk off,
[1244.41s -> 1248.33s]  jerk off. I didn't write that one though, but I'm not going to. I don't care if I get it wrong.
[1248.33s -> 1264.33s]  Um, sleep? Some people nap, right? Some people sleep. Some people, they go to sleep.
[1264.97s -> 1281.50s]  They take naps. Come on. 20 of you said that. Always sleep. Something you do multiple times a day.
[1283.54s -> 1310.60s]  Sneeze. Eat. Drink. Yeah, you drink. That doesn't matter what it is. Drink. Fuck. Two strikes?
[1310.60s -> 1326.41s]  Masturbate, zerk off. Don't be mad that I did that, but it's probably number five. Is that okay? I
[1326.41s -> 1343.35s]  can't write that. Can I? No, I can. I can. I can. I think I can. Can I write that? Okay, so
[1345.48s -> 1349.80s]  something you do multiple times a day. You guys are masturbating, jerking off, zerking off, eating
[1349.80s -> 1359.77s]  and peeing. Some of you guys need to pick up a book instead of reading. Uh, reading! Read. No,
[1359.77s -> 1379.83s]  that's not it. Um, internet. Computer. Use computer. Use computer. Make it simple. Remember,
[1379.83s -> 1389.74s]  it's gotta be simple. Use the computer. You're on it right now. You're doing it right now. You're
[1389.74s -> 1396.09s]  on the computer right now. Of course you use it multiple times a day. Come on. This is relaxing
[1396.09s -> 1403.42s]  fucking music. Oh shit. Come on. Pull me back in. Pull me back. No, what was it? Did anybody get
[1403.42s -> 1410.73s]  a screenshot? Name an Olympic sport you'd watch more often if it were played in the nude.
[1411.37s -> 1424.57s]  What was it? Cry, poop, breathe and shit? Cry, poop and breathe. Zer- zerking off was one of them.
[1424.57s -> 1437.06s]  Okay, name an Olympic sport you'd watch more often if it were played in the nude.
[1440.34s -> 1460.87s]  Oh, I don't know. Archery? Baseball? Uh, Mario Kart. Not Mario Kart. Um, hurdles?
[1466.63s -> 1480.31s]  What? I got them all? It was hurdles? I think it just gave you the wrong screen the dev said. Oh,
[1484.52s -> 1499.51s]  name the worst place for a first date. That's so funny. Worst place for a first date. Um,
[1499.51s -> 1507.88s]  McDonald's or something. I don't know. You have five seconds. I'm gonna say McDonald's.
[1507.88s -> 1511.48s]  McDonald's is a shitty place for a date. It's a great place to get food, but it's a terrible
[1511.48s -> 1521.56s]  place. It's a terrible place. Oh shit. Did it work? Oh, we are killing this website. Oh, wait,
[1521.56s -> 1536.79s]  wait, wait. We're good. I think we're good. 87 fucking hundred people connected. What's the
[1536.79s -> 1551.43s]  song name? Song name is, uh, We Fit, uh, Yoga. We Fit Music Yoga. All right, hold on. I think
[1551.43s -> 1559.90s]  it's gone. It's not the worst. You just get food and talk. I don't know, but I feel like a first
[1559.90s -> 1566.52s]  date. I'm not going to, I'm not going to bring that up. I mean, if my date wants to bring that
[1566.52s -> 1572.28s]  up and says, Hey, let's go to McDonald's. I'm going to say, Oh, all right. Okay. Well, okay.
[1572.28s -> 1577.05s]  Fine. But I'm not going to say, Hey, yo, you want to go to McDonald's for a date? I would take you
[1577.05s -> 1579.77s]  to McDonald's. I would go to McDonald's. I'd have you pick me up and we can go to McDonald's,
[1579.77s -> 1594.02s]  but I'm not going to make that my idea. Give this a counter. Oh, here we go. All right. What
[1594.02s -> 1602.74s]  happened to the music? What's the music back on, dude? Star Fox 64. That's a fucking POG moment.
[1602.74s -> 1611.43s]  All right. Worst place for a first date. Do I need to write? Okay. I spelled it. Do I have
[1611.43s -> 1626.36s]  to spell it right? McDonald's. Number one. I knew it. Okay. McDonald's is number one. Worst
[1626.36s -> 1637.38s]  place for a first date. Uh, people go ice skating. You go to a restaurant. Um, go to a movie. What
[1637.38s -> 1640.34s]  are some bad ones? Okay. You go to a movie. You go ice skating. You go to a movie theater. You go
[1640.34s -> 1644.02s]  to the movies. You go ice skating. You go ice skating again. You go to ice skating a third time.
[1644.02s -> 1649.30s]  Uh, you go to a restaurant. You go to get the, you get sushi. Dude, that sushi was awesome.
[1650.92s -> 1686.26s]  Burger King. Show me Burger King. Wrong. Wendy's. Show me Wendy's. Funeral. Funeral? How about a
[1686.26s -> 1704.49s]  funeral? Fuck. Not Wendy's either. Okay. Only McDonald's. At a funeral. Show me a funeral.
[1704.49s -> 1714.25s]  Ooh, Mario 3D World. The worst game. No, wait. Sorry. That's wrong. Um, what's the other one?
[1714.25s -> 1721.43s]  The 2D one. Worst place for a first date. McDonald's was wrong. Hell. The sewer. Las Vegas.
[1721.43s -> 1730.60s]  That's fucking inaccurate. Jerma's house. Jerma's house. Bathroom and Switch. What's the 2D one that
[1730.60s -> 1749.75s]  I don't like? Hell. Twitch. Imagine going on a date to a Twitch channel. You don't bring dates here.
[1749.75s -> 1753.43s]  Don't say, hey, I'm going to open up on my phone. You open it on your phone and we'll watch them
[1753.43s -> 1760.07s]  together. And then you, then you laugh at a joke I make and what if they don't think it's funny?
[1760.07s -> 1764.97s]  No, you got to do something easy. If you're going to do a Twitch stream, it's got to be
[1764.97s -> 1769.29s]  like a no commentary Hearthstone stream or something. Or like a zero guy talking in the
[1769.29s -> 1776.20s]  corner. It's like, uh, checkers or something. All right, let's keep going. I think we're about to
[1776.20s -> 1790.68s]  load up. It looks like it's all right. We good? Go to Juggles the Great. I took a girl to McDonald's

[1809.91s -> 1813.99s]  we've ever talked. It's time for us to be in the same room on our iPads and watch German.

[1868.06s -> 1876.63s]  The servers are thrashing a bit. Cloud Platform isn't releasing the changes because so many
[1876.63s -> 1882.33s]  people are playing. It's breaking because it waits for you to see the page, but the timer
[1882.33s -> 1888.70s]  still counts down. It's a bug. It's working on it. I have 60 seconds. Name the first item you grab

[2104.41s -> 2115.05s]  about 10 minutes. Give me a minute while I prepare for Chubby Bunny. Right back. God damn it. I hate
[2115.05s -> 2351.00s]  this. I hate every single second of this next 10 minutes of this stream. Right back. Okay. Here we
[2351.00s -> 2358.07s]  go. Those of you that have no idea what's going to happen right now. I did a stupid joke. I did
[2358.07s -> 2369.11s]  a dumb joke during a... Hold on. Turn that off. I made a joke during a stream like three or four
[2369.11s -> 2376.57s]  weeks ago. Didn't think I was going to have to do this. I got damaged in a mission in mafia.
[2376.57s -> 2382.87s]  And I said if that happened, then I would do Chubby Bunny. And I just didn't think I was ever
[2382.87s -> 2393.30s]  going to have to do it. But here we are. By the way, those of you that... I am not going to do
[2393.30s -> 2398.68s]  this until I die. No. I'm not... This is going to be very simple here. If you don't know how this
[2398.68s -> 2405.46s]  works... Oh, fuck. You take a marshmallow and you don't do this because it's fucking dumb.
[2405.46s -> 2410.82s]  It's stupid. Don't do it. It's a stupid thing to do. I'm only going to do enough for the photo.
[2412.46s -> 2417.90s]  It's dumb. Don't do this. Do not do this ever in your house. This is not funny. It's stupid.
[2417.90s -> 2427.38s]  You don't eat them. You just put marshmallows in your mouth and it's like you're the dentist.
[2427.94s -> 2441.30s]  I feel like I could be done right now. I'm not saying it. I'm not saying it. You can't... Oh,
[2441.30s -> 2457.48s]  this is what it looked like if I was a fat guy. I can't do more than three. I'll say it, I promise.

[2468.22s -> 2480.04s]  probably watching the stream going, what the fuck is this kid doing? I didn't raise him like this.

[2521.40s -> 2558.86s]  Is it? No more. Don't fuck... That's... I fucking hated every second of that. I hated every second
[2558.86s -> 2567.74s]  of that. Every second of that sucked. I'm not going to show it to you. That's just... Are you
[2567.74s -> 2590.12s]  kidding me? But hold on. I got a funny idea. Quiet. Wait. Oh, we're going to bring in fucking
[2590.12s -> 2661.43s]  mad viewers with this shit. What the fuck is it? No. Let's go. It hurts. I mean, it's a little sore,
[2661.43s -> 2711.14s]  but hey. Yeah, I'm all right. I just had some work done. I don't even know why I turned on the
[2711.14s -> 2728.04s]  stream. I don't know. I felt like I wanted to stream, but that's really bright. Hey,
[2731.14s -> 2741.32s]  can one of the mods find out how to turn off my stream? I don't know. I don't know how to do it.
[2747.90s -> 2750.94s]  I had all my wisdom teeth pulled out like a couple of minutes ago.
[2757.85s -> 2763.93s]  I'm going to play a new Crash Manicoo tomorrow. If anybody wants to see me play that,
[2763.93s -> 2773.54s]  I'm playing Crash Manicoo tomorrow. This is what a toddler does when they know they did something
[2773.54s -> 2810.54s]  wrong. Did you get in the cookies? That should be an emo. Stanley Kubrick's stare.

[2847.91s -> 2856.06s]  I got to fix my hair. I look like a fucking dickhead. Oh, man. Okay. Okay. Why am I talking like
[2856.06s -> 2861.08s]  that? All right. Let's move this back down. Let's try this again. There you go. That Chubby Bunny,
[2861.08s -> 2865.88s]  a thing that you should never fucking do because it's stupid. Don't do it. It's dumb. I actually,
[2865.88s -> 2869.00s]  like after I got five in there, it was like, okay, I have to stop doing it. Like, I don't want to do
[2869.00s -> 2874.54s]  this anymore. Don't do that. Don't try that at home. Seriously. Disclaimer. Don't do that. All right,
[2874.54s -> 2887.64s]  here we go. We're going to reload the page and see if it works. Oh, hold on. I'm not going to
[2887.64s -> 2893.72s]  address that because I don't want people to do that. I'm not going to address that one. I'm not
[2893.72s -> 2899.22s]  going to address this one because I don't want that's Wikipedia's shit. You have devil horns for

[2926.44s -> 2935.35s]  by answering questions. No. The ad asked me, I should have showed that. I wish I didn't skip
[2935.35s -> 2940.31s]  that immediately. It said, what is your favorite online mattress? It said Casper Purple. There was
[2940.31s -> 2943.35s]  a poll list. It's like they can do it. If you don't think they can, if they don't think they're
[2943.35s -> 2954.31s]  listening to you talking, you're wrong. Okay, here we go. Shadow of the Hedgehog sounds pretty good.
[2957.83s -> 2962.15s]  Okay. This is kind of gross. All right. I look kind of weird. All right, let's refresh the page.
[2962.15s -> 2965.99s]  Let's try this a few more times. Streams over in like 30 minutes. Just want to make that really
[2965.99s -> 2972.66s]  clear. We're going to do this again. Don't worry. All right, let's open it up. Hive mind. Start a
[2972.66s -> 2991.18s]  game and click. Why can I never get it right? It looks like I was just running really fast in like
[2991.18s -> 3002.84s]  a cartoon or something. And I stopped really abruptly. All right. Are we ready? Only a thousand
[3002.84s -> 3006.92s]  people. There's like 11 K people here. Click on it. If you actually don't, cause then the service
[3006.92s -> 3020.57s]  would be fine. I'm starting in three, two, one action. You're about to play five rounds. Go for
[3020.57s -> 3056.41s]  it. Game starts in 11 seconds. Name something you should never eat late at night. And you have a
[3056.41s -> 3059.69s]  bonus question to ask that. Don't tell me what that one is, because that's a lightning round
[3059.69s -> 3070.74s]  question. It was Overwatch. Okay. All right. Something you should never eat late at night.
[3070.74s -> 3075.86s]  Let's see if it works. It's pretty smooth. Okay. Something you shouldn't eat late at night. I don't
[3075.86s -> 3083.02s]  think you should eat. Um, I don't think you should eat ice cream at night because it's just a lot of
[3083.02s -> 3086.50s]  dairy and a lot of sugar. And it really gets in there. Actually, we need the loading bar to make
[3086.50s -> 3093.27s]  sure this is working. It is. Okay. Good. It's a lot of sugar. It's a lot of dairy. It like just sits

[3270.62s -> 3276.14s]  at night. Okay. That's not all right. Uh, cheese, pizza, marshmallows. Um,
