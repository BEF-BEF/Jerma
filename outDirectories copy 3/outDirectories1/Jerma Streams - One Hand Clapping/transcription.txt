[2.23s -> 9.34s]  All right, hi. We're gonna move on to another game that I have been sitting on for a while.
[9.34s -> 17.93s]  This is a singing game. It's called One Hand Clapping. You have to sing to play the game?
[19.40s -> 36.09s]  I will find out if it's any good. Checking it out Thursdays. It's down. Just give me one sec.
[36.09s -> 55.24s]  Well, I think I have to calibrate it too. Let's find out. It's Wednesday? Oh, it is Wednesday.
[55.32s -> 68.47s]  Well, okay. Hopefully this can pick up my microphone. All right, I'll be... Give me one
[68.47s -> 77.93s]  sec. It says a microphone is required to play, which I have. Well, what the fuck? Hello? Can
[77.93s -> 90.22s]  you guys hear this? Oh, okay. Use wired headphones? Oh, no. Wait a minute. I'm gonna... Should I mute
[91.18s -> 157.38s]  This is me muting the actual mic. I'm speech jamming myself as I hear the meter singing.
[157.38s -> 168.62s]  I hear everything. I hear everything. The meter should light up when you sing and turn off when
[168.62s -> 174.92s]  you apply. Make sure it's not activated by breathing in the background. You guys, you can't... It's
[174.92s -> 196.15s]  not way too damp. I'm delayed though. I think this is fine. I actually have to keep this off.
[196.15s -> 202.66s]  This is gonna be so stupid. What a terrible screen this is gonna be. I need to get my...
[211.90s -> 229.93s]  It's not like you're giving a speech. I need to delay the webcam by like a tenth of a second.
[230.65s -> 248.23s]  Actually, this might be... You tell me when it's matched up. Am I matched up? One, two, three.
[253.22s -> 262.92s]  One, two, three. Is that better? Two, three. Turn it up. I mean, it's the game. This is as long as
[262.92s -> 279.30s]  I can go, man. I can't turn the audio up. Maybe I can. Hold on. Two. Sorry. It's gonna... Is this
[279.30s -> 290.31s]  okay? This is not a stream routine. This is not a stream that... This is the game. It's too quiet still.
[291.64s -> 297.64s]  It's gonna go really fucking loud. It's gonna go really, really loud. Turn your fucking speakers
[297.64s -> 313.53s]  down right now. Turn your speakers down. How's that? Are we good? Put the music... All right.
[313.53s -> 322.23s]  Honestly, turn your shit down. The music might be insanely loud. It's gonna be so loud. Turn
[322.23s -> 409.88s]  your speakers down. I'm serious. Am I missing something? Oh, over here. Did I break the game?
[409.88s -> 423.70s]  Oh, new game. The game's called One Hand Clapping. Oh, I know it's due.
[425.94s -> 466.36s]  I can jump. My microphone's fine. It really is like an ambulance driving by.
[473.08s -> 504.34s]  Am I sick? Am I over here? The audio is awful. That's the game. That is the game.
[504.58s -> 564.92s]  I was on the key. What's going on? Hey, I thought that didn't sound like it. That was like, no way.
[580.87s -> 606.76s]  How was it? Do a pedigree. Hey, Lois. Let's take a show. It's like auto.
[606.76s -> 756.66s]  I'm so mad. See the beat? I can't break it. You have to understand. I am hearing this.
[759.06s -> 765.43s]  Do, do, knee, knee, two, two, go, go, two, two, the, the story story. It's fucking horrible.
[774.18s -> 786.41s]  Oh, hi, guys. This is what I hear. I hear this. Isn't that tough to listen to?
[875.54s -> 884.17s]  This does not sound better. No, it does not. This there's no way this sounds better.
[888.33s -> 895.13s]  It does sound better. Give me a clip. One, two, three, one, two, three. Hey, what's up, everybody?
[895.13s -> 928.57s]  I want to hear it. This does not sound better. No, it does not. This there's no way this sounds
[928.57s -> 937.16s]  better. It does sound better. Give me a clip. One, two, three, one, two, three.
[942.02s -> 948.02s]  That sounds like shit, guys. All right, fine. I'll keep it on. I'm turning this shit off during
[948.02s -> 970.25s]  important things. Okay. So what do I do? I broke it. No, I didn't. Okay.
[983.88s -> 1030.94s]  There you go. Fuck off. What the fuck is going on?
[1043.19s -> 1073.86s]  I fucked that up. This sounds so bad. This is bad. Do the misery? No.
[1094.57s -> 1152.84s]  Okay. Are you upset? No. What's going on?
[1177.75s -> 1193.13s]  Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy.
[1193.13s -> 1218.76s]  Fucking easy. The louder you sing, the more the meter will fill.
[1272.54s -> 1281.70s]  That sucked. That sucked. That hurt so bad.
[1355.13s -> 1363.62s]  Okay, what do I do with this one? Just ride the clock? Do a cat puke?
[1365.45s -> 1421.66s]  It was a button. I'm switching back and forth. It's going to be really loud. I could actually
[1421.66s -> 1425.90s]  just talk and it'll spin around and shit. That's fine. I have to hold the note.
[1428.84s -> 1442.62s]  What time does it have to be?
[1534.84s -> 1542.23s]  Okay, we're good. This is, wow.
[1563.16s -> 1564.52s]  Singing is fucking hard.
[1619.46s -> 1629.24s]  I'm going to be speech jammed for the next like two, three hours. I have to sing duets?
[1644.02s -> 1721.06s]  Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. I wish I could get new lyrics.
[1723.54s -> 1733.29s]  Fucking help me.
[1761.05s -> 1822.15s]  Not even trying. I'm not going to sing an entire song to get this thing to fucking move up and down.
[1824.63s -> 1825.03s]  It's just.
[1876.28s -> 1913.45s]  What if I did like halfway like this? I can still hear it though. I think it's important.
[1916.42s -> 1919.70s]  Yeah, because I think that during the course of the game it records what I say
[1920.26s -> 1928.97s]  and plays it back. I'm 99% sure that there's two, there's cases in this game where you
[1928.97s -> 1934.10s]  you won't be able to hear it. It's important. It's got to stay.
[1934.10s -> 1934.60s]  Okay.
[1938.73s -> 1942.12s]  Use your webcam mic. Well now why I can't hear it now.
[1943.56s -> 1981.34s]  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What happened? Hello? It's important. I'm not going to use a webcam mic.
[1981.34s -> 1988.36s]  Oh my. Maybe I should. I'm very curious. What if I do that? We need to see what it's, I need to see.
[2051.27s -> 2101.29s]  This thing doesn't, I can't do it. That was easy.
[2113.27s -> 2141.14s]  I can go. No, Shido is worse for him.
[2164.57s -> 2198.82s]  Let's go. Rip your vocal cords. I'll be all right.
[2204.97s -> 2220.10s]  Did you warm up before this? Um, I think so. Kind of. Now what? Oh my god.
[2245.14s -> 2272.38s]  Yeah, I know it was bad. It was bad. I can't match that. That was bad. It works. It's okay.
[2315.90s -> 2355.56s]  Why was I trying to go over? I was trying to go over that for no reason.
[2357.08s -> 2441.21s]  That could have been better, but it's okay. I think I have to hit the button.
[2441.21s -> 2535.08s]  That was really loud. That's why I have them both off. We're good. I gotta.
[2535.08s -> 2641.86s]  Jerma, you look skinny. No, I'm like 170 pounds. I'm a fat fuck. What? That was close.
[2643.06s -> 2648.10s]  That was a close one. Scream into the mic.
[2694.41s -> 2731.53s]  You're making me laugh. People are, I'm skinny. I'm five, seven, 170 pounds. That's, that's not,
[2731.53s -> 2739.56s]  that's not, that's overweight. That's actually fucking overweight. I'm not six, two. I'm literally
[2739.56s -> 2744.60s]  five, seven and a half. And yes, I may be a little overweight.
[2803.90s -> 2835.70s]  God damn it. Imagine this with multiplayer. It'd be insane. Now what? Okay. This person
[2835.70s -> 2942.46s]  hasn't done anything. Okay. What does that mean? It looks like I got out of prison. Why?
[2942.46s -> 2944.30s]  Dude, you're tone deaf. I'm not.
[2992.25s -> 2996.42s]  What do you mean Bjork? I don't sound like Bjork. What do you mean?
[3041.37s -> 3061.43s]  The whole thing is fucked up now. I can't play anymore. Push your Adam's apple up.
[3131.83s -> 3152.78s]  And then somebody says Bjork and I'm like fuck. Oh, I hear like what? That's what I hear. You
[3152.78s -> 3204.34s]  fucked up the whole screen. You fucked my whole screen. I hear that. I'm so thankful
[3204.34s -> 3219.99s]  to hear that. I'm so glad I have a container to puke into. I'm so glad I have a computer to
[3219.99s -> 3239.88s]  puke into. That's so fucking funny. It's not a computer. I can't hear anything.
[3243.06s -> 3255.72s]  I didn't mean to say computer. I meant to say a fucking coffee cup. I meant to say a coffee cup.
[3256.04s -> 3264.98s]  I'm being speech jams. You don't understand.
[3265.94s -> 3297.99s]  This is a coffee cup that I just spit everything into. No, I don't. That's coffee.
[3337.18s -> 3378.84s]  It's not chewing tobacco. You fucking weirdo. I'm sorry. I don't even think of it. It's in my head.
[3379.72s -> 3385.80s]  You know, turn this shit off for a second. All I hear in my head is just Bjork and that person
[3385.80s -> 3403.77s]  ruined the whole stream. You fucking idiot. I don't even know what happened. I don't remember
[3403.77s -> 3410.50s]  what happened. I need a clip. I don't remember what just happened. I started choking. I puked
[3410.50s -> 3437.78s]  into a coffee cup. What happened? I don't even know why that happened. Did he just puke? Can you
[3437.78s -> 3449.29s]  hear it? Hold on. Do you actually hear the puke sounds? No, you don't. Wait a second. You don't
[3449.29s -> 3490.39s]  actually hear it, do you? No. It sounds like I'm inside of a fucking toilet bowl. No, I didn't
[3490.39s -> 3511.51s]  puke. I just spit what was in my mouth. Okay. No, I didn't actually puke. That does look like I
[3511.51s -> 3517.11s]  actually threw up. You don't see me. I drank another sip. What the fuck? It actually is like
[3517.11s -> 3530.20s]  I puked. All right, let's go. We lost a thousand viewers during this, by the way. I think 2,000
[3530.20s -> 3540.89s]  people left in the last 15 minutes. No, I didn't puke. I just spit what was in my mouth. Okay,
[3540.89s -> 3555.88s]  this is clean. Viewers plummeting. Somebody just said, I'm close to leaving. All right. All right.
[3555.88s -> 3561.00s]  Fucking stop. Enough. Enough. Enough. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[3561.00s -> 3580.92s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Are you ready? I just did like a curly laugh from The Three Stooges.
[3580.92s -> 3591.56s]  Fuck you. Fucking goddamn Bjork is in my head again. All right. You ready? Let's go.
[3604.74s -> 3608.10s]  What the fuck happened? I didn't make that noise.
[3851.59s -> 4001.86s]  I said 100 gags. Stop naming musicians that aren't me. Stop naming people that aren't me.
[4003.53s -> 4048.70s]  Stop. You're not a musician. Okay. Sure about that? Yeah. You sure about that? Fuck out of here.
[4048.70s -> 4073.82s]  Ban them. Imagine raging at a game like this. I was about to punch the microphone. I was going
[4073.82s -> 4168.50s]  to punch the microphone. That was really fun. We're gonna play something else.
[4171.10s -> 4172.78s]  Let me try it without the headphones in.
[4214.33s -> 4219.29s]  Bjork is is 100,000 times more talented than I will ever be in my whole life.
[4220.25s -> 4232.47s]  I can see that. I can understand that sentiment. So where we go now?
[4232.47s -> 4250.79s]  Vampire Survivors? Go back to Wheel of Fortune. Wheel of Fortune? I could turn on Wheel of Fortune.
[4250.79s -> 4263.98s]  Yeah. Okay. We'll do Wheel of Fortune for like an hour or so. Okay. Yeah. Give me one sec.
[4263.98s -> 4271.03s]  Change in game and change in console. That was really cute. These two games are actually really
[4271.03s -> 4286.84s]  cool. Something different. Something interesting. I've actually been sitting on those games for a
[4286.84s -> 4294.95s]  little while. The coolest part about that was one-handed clapping. Oh, one-hand clapping,
[4294.95s -> 4302.78s]  by the way. That was the fact that you can see in real time. You probably could train
[4302.78s -> 4307.88s]  your voice pretty well. All right. I'll be right back. I'm going to get the Wheel of Fortune set
[4307.88s -> 4329.46s]  up because it's on the Switch. So I'm going to get that set up or be right back. Just kidding.
[4330.73s -> 4345.67s]  Now I'll be right back. I guess I don't really have to even go anywhere. Do I?
[4346.55s -> 4354.87s]  I'm trying to capture the Switch right now, which can be finicky. Give me one sec.
[4362.87s -> 4382.86s]  Where is it? Where is it? It should be capturing it. I don't know why it's not.
[4382.86s -> 4390.92s]  My capture card can be really weird, though, for some reason. It just doesn't want to capture it.
[4390.92s -> 4397.13s]  Oh, hold on. Hold on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I know you can do it.
[4397.13s -> 4407.91s]  Come on. Come on. What do you mean no signal? Oh, I took the HDMI out of the back. All right.
[4407.91s -> 4408.87s]  Actually, BRB.
