[1.46s -> 19.18s]  Okay, so, uh, someone want to link me a good one? What's a good one? This website has a shitload
[19.18s -> 31.74s]  of them, don't they? There's a lot on here. I haven't even eaten at half of these places.
[31.74s -> 43.67s]  Well, maybe, actually, maybe I have. Let me get it on screen. Give me a minute. Less than that.
[54.31s -> 65.03s]  Good old browser. Please capture the window, if you would. That would be nice. Are you not going
[65.03s -> 108.18s]  to capture my window here? Come on. This is going to be hard to do. Okay. All right. Looks
[108.18s -> 122.60s]  pretty good. Let me get back on screen here. All right. So, what am I supposed to do about this,
[122.60s -> 138.66s]  right? I'm supposed to... I drag these up into the front. Fast food. Okay, well, I'm currently
[138.66s -> 143.38s]  getting a Blue Man Group ad. Let me, like, shrink the screen because it's going to distract me.
[143.38s -> 162.76s]  There we go. That's better. Oh, you piece of crap. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing?
[162.76s -> 173.82s]  I don't care about Blue. I've already seen the Blue Man Group. All right. Here we go. Uh, so,
[173.82s -> 178.84s]  S is, like, the best I've ever had. D is, like, place sucks, or at least I think it sucks.
[180.63s -> 186.84s]  Welcome to two months ago. I'm the streamer that's doing it now. Here we go. Uh, Papa John's,
[186.84s -> 194.33s]  Papa John's is, I think, sucks. It's gross. But I can already, I can put that one out. White Castle
[194.33s -> 208.49s]  is not good at all. Um, can I be done? Can I just be done? Can all these just be,
[208.49s -> 219.75s]  like, who cares? Okay. Um, wait, why is there a soda on here? Disqualified.
[225.10s -> 235.93s]  Cashberg? Cashburger? Rashberg? Like, like, Rashburger. I don't know what this place is.
[237.37s -> 251.06s]  Disqualified. I don't know what Cashberg is. Sonic? Awful. Subway? Awful. All the way. No,
[251.06s -> 265.59s]  I can't put everything in D. Everything's gonna be it. Wait, hold on. I'm gonna, hold on,
[265.59s -> 271.93s]  I'm gonna leave it like this for now. I'm gonna piss off a lot of people with this,
[271.93s -> 280.36s]  but I don't think, I think Chipotle's not very good. Church's Chicken? I've never eaten it.
[283.08s -> 299.90s]  Okay. Quiznos was god tier. Absolute god tier. But they, they, like, didn't they close permanently?
[299.90s -> 306.18s]  I haven't seen a Quiznos in probably, like, fucking 10 years. They're closing them all up.
[306.74s -> 320.38s]  Keep it a B. Deserves to be there. I haven't eaten a Little Caesars pizza in a long time,
[320.38s -> 333.03s]  but I remember it was, like, not that great. Domino's? No. Long John Silver's? No. No. Dairy
[333.03s -> 342.20s]  Queen? You know, you're up at, you're up at C. No, you're at B. McDonald's? B. No. McDonald's? D. No.
[344.41s -> 357.61s]  No. Jersey Mike's overrated. Jimmy John's overrated. Mo's? Get that up on B tier.
[358.33s -> 365.93s]  Mo's is way better than Chipotle. I will say that a thousand times.
[370.89s -> 381.03s]  Elta? Denny's? Denny's can be up here. Five Guys? I don't know if I'd put Five Guys on,
[381.03s -> 392.22s]  on, like, the Quiznos tier. I might. Maybe. Popeyes? I've never, all right, should I take
[392.22s -> 398.81s]  off restaurants that I've never eaten before? This is kind of unfair. I've drank an A&W soda
[398.81s -> 406.10s]  before, isn't that, is that all right? I've never had cashburg before. I'm not even sure
[406.10s -> 412.95s]  I've ever eaten at Long John Silver's, so it has to come off. Make a new tier for uneaten.
[413.51s -> 439.05s]  How do I do that? Uh, just make it uneaten. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Any of these restaurants new?
[439.05s -> 447.96s]  Uh oh. Delete this one. There we go. Oh, fuck. What happened? What happened to D? I lost D.
[448.84s -> 466.17s]  No, no, no, no, no. Un, add, uneaten. Got it. It's there. D. What is going on? D. How do I add
[466.17s -> 480.12s]  another row? Add row below. There we go. Okay. Uneaten. That's fine. Okay. D. Let's put D where
[480.12s -> 487.45s]  it was before. What color was D before? Like, like cold? Like cold ass food? Yeah. All right.
[488.92s -> 498.49s]  Where have I, I gotta, I gotta, where have I not eaten? I've never had, I've never eaten Carl's
[498.49s -> 512.74s]  Jr. I've never, there's too many things on here. Wendy's goes up here for now. I don't, I've never,
[512.74s -> 519.11s]  I've never eaten at church. I don't know what okay is. I think this, no, that's, this is Del Taco.
[519.11s -> 524.31s]  I think I've had this once, but I don't even remember eating it. So I'm gonna, it's as if
[524.31s -> 531.88s]  I never had it in the first place. Chick-fil-A. I've eaten it a couple times. It was very good.
[532.60s -> 541.94s]  Is it better than Denny's? Yeah. HBO. Okay. Do I have an HBO prime subscription?
[542.58s -> 553.11s]  Oh, no, that's Firehouse Subs. Okay. I've had Firehouse Subs before. I would put it in here.
[557.94s -> 569.21s]  IHOP. I'm only putting IHOP down here because I think I've driven by an IHOP
[570.17s -> 581.34s]  more times than I've been inside of a McDonald's. That's how I determine if I'm ever, if I'm ever
[581.34s -> 586.84s]  gonna go there. You literally drive by it and you go, oh, there's an IHOP. Never gonna eat there.
[587.56s -> 596.92s]  Oh, we're on that, we're on the road again. Oh, oh, I'm hungry. No, I could really go for some
[596.92s -> 601.54s]  food right now. Something cheap and something that I got, a sit-down place. No, I don't think so.
[602.10s -> 610.74s]  That's, that's not that I've eaten there before, but I just, I, what is this? Is this Olive Garden?
[610.74s -> 620.68s]  I don't know what that is. Is it Olive Garden? I just see olive. Culver's. I don't know what that
[620.68s -> 628.42s]  is. Cash Burger, I've never eaten that. Krispy Kreme. The only experience I have at Krispy Kreme
[629.06s -> 637.06s]  is when my high school did a thing where you bought them and it was a huge deal and I remember
[637.06s -> 646.18s]  eating like two or three of them and thinking it was like just okay, I guess. Well, I, the last
[646.18s -> 650.78s]  time I had a Krispy Kreme donut, I was probably like 16, so I may as well have never even eaten.
[657.05s -> 661.29s]  Because I can't, I cannot reliably place it anywhere. I've only had it once like 15 years ago.
[662.01s -> 667.99s]  Dunkin' Donuts? Sucks, but it's, it's all right though. No, I wouldn't, what did I put, what did
[667.99s -> 681.32s]  I put Dunkin' Donuts up with Denny's? I definitely, no, I wouldn't do that. Krispy Kreme is S tier,
[681.32s -> 683.80s]  that's fine, but I've never played it before. I had, I've never played that game.
[687.58s -> 695.16s]  Shits? This place called Sheets? I don't think I want to eat at the place called Shits.
[695.80s -> 712.31s]  Is that what that place is actually called? It's called Shits. No, it's not. I've never had it. I
[712.31s -> 721.94s]  don't know. Is it fictional? People are going to be mad about this one too. In-N-Out Burger!
[721.94s -> 726.42s]  We're all in an, oh, I can't wait to see where he puts In-N-Out. It's going to be like fucking up on
[726.42s -> 742.71s]  A. It's all right, settle down. It's okay. It's just a hamburger restaurant. Don't worry if it's,
[742.71s -> 764.23s]  it's going to be fine. Relax. They don't even fucking compare. Is it better than McDonald's?
[767.99s -> 772.47s]  No, and I have to go through these and I have to do each one in an individual subcategory,
[772.47s -> 778.94s]  right? So this could be like an A plus down to like an A minus, right? I'll take care of this.
[784.70s -> 790.62s]  No, I know. I just got to get everything in the right mind zone here. I have not eaten here.
[792.20s -> 808.94s]  I've eaten here, I think, once. Let me remember. It was definitely better than
[809.50s -> 820.65s]  like firehouse subs. I think that's accurate. This place only does chicken, right? This is like the
[820.65s -> 850.22s]  chicken place. Fuck. I had second thoughts about something here. Hold on. You have to add an F
[850.22s -> 872.06s]  category. Do I really have to have an F? No, having an F category is just, this is where I put places
[872.06s -> 882.54s]  to get people to unsubscribe the channel. Burger King. Oh, damn. Okay. Hold on a minute. Burger
[882.54s -> 903.21s]  King goes up here. Does it though? Panda Express sucks. Okay. That's probably the, I don't know
[903.21s -> 917.51s]  if there's any others that are going to be in. I've been to like four Panda Expresses and each
[917.51s -> 924.70s]  time it has been, it has been awful. I mean, it's been, I'm not, I'm not saying this as like to be
[924.70s -> 935.45s]  like the dick or mean or anything. It's been awful every time. It really has. When you're eating
[935.45s -> 945.08s]  food and the only thing that you can think of is, yeah, I mean, it's, I wouldn't order this again,
[945.08s -> 953.72s]  but it's, it's, it's edible. It's not, it's edible. Yeah. So is a fucking shoe if you chop it up.
[965.40s -> 969.00s]  Hold on though. I'm about to bring a lot of people back into, into my corner here.
[969.64s -> 990.66s]  I don't get it. In fact, I'm doing this. I don't, I'm not a big fan of the way the Starbucks coffee
[990.66s -> 999.26s]  tastes. I don't really, it's, it's coffee. It's all right. But I don't know if it's like, look,
[999.82s -> 1004.15s]  here's the thing about Dunkin Donuts versus Starbucks. Dunkin Donuts, they're going to screw
[1004.15s -> 1008.39s]  your order up all the time. And sometimes you're going to drink out of the cup and you're going to
[1008.39s -> 1014.49s]  like get like a burning taste in your mouth and you're going to go like, but it's like three and
[1014.49s -> 1023.43s]  a half dollars less expensive than this one. And if you're going to drink this one, you may as well
[1023.43s -> 1034.73s]  just go to like the next level up of coffee. Now that's not to say that if you, I mean, there's a
[1034.73s -> 1038.81s]  Starbucks everywhere. I drink Starbucks fucking all the time. If there's a Starbucks in the corner,
[1038.81s -> 1041.93s]  it's like, all right, well, I'm just going to get a coffee. I'm not saying don't ever, I'm just saying
[1043.78s -> 1048.34s]  the differences that it's not that it's not that big of a deal. If you drink Dunkin Donuts over
[1048.34s -> 1053.22s]  Starbucks, one of them's quick and fast and cheap. The other one is
[1057.90s -> 1063.64s]  fast and I don't know what's the word I'm looking for.
[1072.87s -> 1078.86s]  Fast and expensive. They have some good stuff at Starbucks though. Somebody said the refreshers.
[1078.86s -> 1087.26s]  Those things are really good. No, but I would rather drink it like another coffee shop than
[1087.26s -> 1092.94s]  Starbucks. Okay. Tim Hortons, never had it. Sorry. Sorry to all the Canadians. I've never had it
[1092.94s -> 1101.58s]  before. Arby's. Now here's a tough one because Arby's, depending on the day, Arby's is either a
[1101.58s -> 1109.74s]  B or an F. I've gone to Arby's before and been like, wow, that was like really delicious.
[1110.62s -> 1115.50s]  And I've been there the other half of the time and it was like unedible. I want to throw this
[1115.50s -> 1128.68s]  in the trash. So I don't know where to put it. Probably down here. KFC, KFC can go up here.
[1129.32s -> 1148.26s]  KFC is just like Kane's 0.4. You know what I mean? Buffalo Wild Wings? My D is going to be
[1148.26s -> 1159.85s]  full of stuff. Fatburger. Have I had Fatburger? Maybe once or twice. Maybe. Is it enough to rate
[1159.85s -> 1186.52s]  it? I had to change my opinion on that. How is Taco Bell an A? It just is. Pizza Hut. Whoa, whoa,
[1186.84s -> 1197.34s]  what? What? What? Everyone's freaking out. The stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut. That's my
[1198.30s -> 1203.67s]  level here. Is the stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut better than anything on the Chipotle menu?
[1204.54s -> 1209.34s]  Yes. Is the stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut better than anything on the McDonald's menu?
[1209.90s -> 1218.52s]  Yes. Better than anything on Jersey Mike's menu? Yes. Better than anything on Jimmy John's menu?
[1218.52s -> 1233.82s]  Yes. Better than anything on that menu? Yes. Actually, no. All right, I got it. Yeah,
[1233.82s -> 1237.18s]  like the patty melt from Denny's is just better than the stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut.
[1238.39s -> 1250.84s]  Fuck! Better than In-N-Out though, for sure. Do I have to level? I might have to level up Denny's.
[1251.56s -> 1259.64s]  You don't have any pizza places above a C. It's because most of the fucking pizza chain places
[1259.64s -> 1273.05s]  suck. No, Denny's is going to be a high C, I think. Let's move it over here. Look, I really
[1273.05s -> 1281.29s]  don't want to be like a pizza elitist or a dick or anything, but if you live in an area that has,
[1281.29s -> 1285.29s]  look, pizza places, think about if you just type into your phone or like into Google or whatever,
[1285.29s -> 1293.83s]  just type in pizza place or pizza nearby, there's more pizza places than there are Starbuckses.
[1293.91s -> 1300.41s]  And I'm not talking about like Pizza Hut. I'm talking about like, like Sal's Pizza,
[1300.41s -> 1308.02s]  like Pizzeria Regina, like there's so many pizza places that are better than Pizza Hut. There are
[1308.02s -> 1311.94s]  so many pizza places that exist that are not chain pizza restaurants, why would you ever eat
[1311.94s -> 1319.51s]  at one of the chains? If you live in a city, if you don't have that option, then I completely
[1319.51s -> 1326.89s]  understand. Yeah. But if there is another pizza place that's not Domino's, it's probably going
[1326.89s -> 1339.32s]  to be better than Domino's. Eat family pizza. That's right. Chain pizza survives off quantity,
[1339.32s -> 1348.79s]  not quality. Yeah. And look, Pizza Hut's out here at C. Domino's is, I just don't like Domino's. I
[1348.79s -> 1358.36s]  really don't. I like Pizza Hut. I would choose Pizza Hut over a lot of restaurants, like actual
[1358.52s -> 1364.02s]  pizza restaurants. I would, by that logic, everything on this list should be lower than
[1364.02s -> 1370.10s]  B with all local restaurants at an A or a B. Yeah, I gotta love my local restaurant up here,
[1370.10s -> 1382.66s]  Taco Bell. All right, let's keep going. Panera Bread is a C. Panera Bread,
[1385.48s -> 1390.84s]  once you eat Panera Bread like three times, the, oh wow, a cheddar broccoli soup and a bread bowl,
[1390.84s -> 1394.44s]  like you don't give a shit anymore. You don't, it doesn't matter anymore. It's just like a
[1394.52s -> 1400.38s]  soup and a bowl. If it's your first time eating a Panera Bread, it's probably up here. If it's your
[1400.38s -> 1406.42s]  fifth time eating a Panera Bread, it's probably like over here. It's not, it loses its flair.
[1406.42s -> 1411.86s]  It's still all right though. I still, it's not, it's still good. I don't know what this is.
[1413.75s -> 1424.07s]  What is that? I don't know. Popeye's Chicken. Unfortunately, everybody, I have never eaten it.
[1424.07s -> 1436.60s]  I've not had it one time. Oh, hold on, I'm losing the, Zaxby's? Never had it. Boston Market,
[1436.60s -> 1441.69s]  I think I've had it twice. Maybe not even, and this was like 20 years ago. So the recipe
[1441.69s -> 1455.56s]  definitely changed. Fat Burger. I don't remember. I like, it's probably, no, it was all right.
[1465.16s -> 1469.26s]  Jack in the Box is, if you're going to go to Jack in the Box, just go to McDonald's.
[1475.54s -> 1478.82s]  I've had it a couple of times and it's been like cold and gross and awful. Same thing with
[1478.82s -> 1486.52s]  Sonic. Where's Sonic? Make sure Sonic's at F. If it's, my reasoning for Sonic being an F
[1487.40s -> 1494.28s]  is because I've had it a few times and every single fucking time it was cold. It took like
[1494.28s -> 1504.20s]  30 minutes to come out and was not very good. That's just the way it was. I'm, I'm, I've,
[1504.20s -> 1508.34s]  I've eaten the food there. I know Sonic does a bunch of those, he's like weird,
[1509.30s -> 1517.29s]  like frat, strawberry cheesecake, banana lime cream drinks that I've never, I've never had one.
[1517.29s -> 1529.37s]  No, I'm not a fan. It's a meme restaurant? But what about those funny commercial guys?
[1530.01s -> 1545.22s]  Oh yeah, those, there are the two funny commercial guys. All right, so Wawa. I think I've had Wawa
[1545.22s -> 1549.85s]  before. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't, I'm not gonna look. Is
[1549.85s -> 1556.90s]  Wawa like a bowl place where you make your own bowl? Is it like, kind of Asian fusion? It is,
[1556.90s -> 1575.54s]  right? Okay, well then I don't think I've ever had it. Steak and Shake. I've had this a few times,
[1576.65s -> 1579.69s]  but not enough to like, to make, this is the thing, there's too many things here.
[1580.33s -> 1586.18s]  I remember being all right. It was, I remember being at like, okay.
[1588.26s -> 1598.78s]  Wada Burger. There's too many like burger places. I've had too many hamburgers.
[1599.82s -> 1606.28s]  I don't remember. I think I've had it once. And every one of these places that I've had one time
[1606.28s -> 1614.54s]  was just, oh, okay, it's pretty, it's good. But is that like, oh, S tier? No, I don't know, but I'd
[1614.54s -> 1624.01s]  see. What was this one? Somebody gave a lot of money. Hold on. KXZ just gave another $50. Thank
[1624.01s -> 1635.54s]  you, KXZ. Thank you. 50 bucks disgusting medieval peasant food in local pizza places, A tier or
[1635.54s -> 1644.17s]  riot. This is fast food though. We got to at least be fair, but thank you for the fucking 50 bucks.
[1649.96s -> 1655.08s]  Why do I have KFC over Wada Burger? Well, I haven't done my complete list yet.
[1655.72s -> 1662.98s]  Hey, when am I supposed to get a drink? Little Caesars. It's probably down here. Long John
[1662.98s -> 1666.26s]  Silver's. I don't have never hit it. I don't know what this is. Never eaten it. I thought that was
[1666.26s -> 1679.72s]  Starbucks too. The rest of these, I don't think I've had at all. Wing Stop. I don't, I've never had
[1679.72s -> 1690.92s]  this. What's Ojan? Ojan? I've never had it. What's, I don't know what that is. I don't think I've had
[1690.92s -> 1698.89s]  any of these. Look, I don't eat that much fast food. I only eat the fucking S tier ones.
[1700.95s -> 1708.42s]  Checkers. No, I've never had it. Checkers. Half of these restaurants are not even physically
[1708.42s -> 1713.98s]  available to me my whole life. How am I supposed to go to a Tim Hortons when you have to live in
[1713.98s -> 1720.98s]  Canada to drink it? I live in the United States of America. There's no Tim Hortons in America.
[1726.44s -> 1733.99s]  There's, there's one in New York. Oh shit. I've gotta get on that plane and go to New York to
[1733.99s -> 1745.80s]  drink Tim Hortons. This is what I've eaten. Let me, let me, let me make sure. And I'm gonna put the
[1745.80s -> 1751.86s]  uneaten ones in their own category. Places where I probably never will eat. The bottom is places I
[1751.86s -> 1755.30s]  will never eat. Places up top is like, you know what? I'll check it out. Might sound like pretty
[1755.30s -> 1771.80s]  good to me. Remember, it's in line. So like one, two, this is top to bottom. Cashberg sounds
[1771.80s -> 1779.75s]  interesting. I don't, I don't want churches. All right. I'm going to put this up here because
[1779.75s -> 1785.11s]  I feel like I've had it. And I remember it, my, my walked by and said, it looked like I want to go
[1785.11s -> 1791.34s]  in that place. I don't know. I'm not going to eat here. I don't know anything about it.
[1800.94s -> 1806.54s]  Krispy Kreme. But I, would I actually go into a Krispy Kreme donut to buy Krispy Kremes? I feel
[1806.54s -> 1810.30s]  like I would only want that if somebody handed it to me and said, Hey, this is a Krispy Kreme donut.
[1810.30s -> 1819.66s]  Do you want one? Sure. I guess I'll have one. I'm not eating at shits. No, I would try shits.
[1821.27s -> 1830.82s]  Yeah. Just cause it would be like, Oh yeah. I would eat shits. Carl's Jr. No, I don't,
[1830.82s -> 1856.39s]  I'm not going to eat. Sorry. I'm not going to eat at Emote Arby's. Um, I think that's all right.
[1856.39s -> 1865.43s]  I would eat at this place. I, I, you know, I want, I want Popeyes. I'll try it. That's the next place
[1865.43s -> 1871.75s]  I'm going to eat. That's, I don't know if that is, is, is Popeyes even on the west coast? Is it like
[1871.75s -> 1881.70s]  even in Las Vegas? Is there one in Las Vegas? I will go to it. Wait, that's, that's Kudobo. That's
[1881.70s -> 1889.99s]  Kudobo. Oh, Kudobo is good. All right. Let's put this up here. I didn't know what that was. That's
[1889.99s -> 1903.43s]  okay. That's no, that's pretty good. I've had it before. It's good. I've had it. Yeah. All right.
[1903.43s -> 1928.68s]  Let's see. What's the worst? That's accurate. Where's Chipotle? Where's Chipotle? Where's Chipotle?
[1928.68s -> 1942.31s]  And why is it not down here at D? Where is Chipotle? Oh, it's the first seat. Get out of there.
[1942.31s -> 1949.86s]  No, it does not belong there. All right. Let's go, but let's go worst to best here. So definitely
[1949.86s -> 1954.34s]  Pan, I just, Pan Express is always, it's so hit or miss. And usually it's a swing and a miss every
[1954.34s -> 1960.65s]  time. It just, I'm sorry. It just is. Out of all these restaurants that I think are all right,
[1961.21s -> 1967.86s]  that I would eat at, which one would I want to eat at the most or drink at the most?
[1973.14s -> 1990.70s]  Holy shit. I don't know if I can do this. Like I'm not going back to Arby's.
[1991.50s -> 2003.03s]  You know what I mean? Fool me once. Shame on me. Fool me twice. You can't get fooled again.
[2003.03s -> 2015.16s]  Whatever he said, that funny George Bush thing. Um, I don't, I really, really don't like Domino's.
[2015.16s -> 2025.74s]  I don't, I think it's bad. Buffalo Wild Wings is all right. They only do one thing that's worth
[2025.74s -> 2035.53s]  eating there though. But it is in the title, but sometimes they're not, but I drive by, I hop and
[2035.53s -> 2048.70s]  I go, Oh no. It's not Papa John's. Papa John's is all the way at the bottom. This Papa John's just
[2048.70s -> 2053.98s]  tastes like a DiGiorno pizza that you made in your own house. Like you do like put the DiGiorno in the
[2053.98s -> 2060.06s]  oven and it came out and it was a Papa John's pizza. That's what it tastes like. I don't, I
[2060.06s -> 2071.26s]  don't want a like delivery DiGiorno. I want a delivery pizza. Why the fuck is there a Papa John
[2071.26s -> 2088.81s]  emote? What? It's not delivery. I know. It's not delivery. No, this is delivery. No, Papa John's,
[2088.81s -> 2093.69s]  you bite into the pizza and you take a big bite and every topping and all the cheese and everything
[2093.69s -> 2100.52s]  just comes off. That's why. Oh, was this a mushroom, onions and peppers pizza? Let me take a bite of
[2100.52s -> 2132.23s]  that. Oh, oops. I'll take my fucking like double dare flag that I'm left with. No, I'm sorry. I've
[2132.23s -> 2137.11s]  made my decision. I would drink an A&W root beer right now. In fact, you know what? Let's get this
[2137.11s -> 2142.63s]  up here. Just because I just saw that and I was like I want a fresh fucking frosty bug of A&W
[2142.63s -> 2151.35s]  that goes up to the level because of that. I don't know why. I just thought this said free wi-fi.
[2154.39s -> 2160.31s]  Free wi-fi at Buffalo Wi-Fi Wings? What? That's, that's different. That's not the, that's not
[2160.31s -> 2177.27s]  the name of the restaurant. Buffalo Wi-Fi Wings. You get free fucking wi-fi. This is accurate now.
[2177.91s -> 2187.11s]  I mean White Castle has the, if I like, if I drove by one of these D restaurants. All right. Ooh,
[2187.11s -> 2193.46s]  they made a movie about this. This is, he's a cartoon. Like the other thing is based on
[2193.46s -> 2198.18s]  television and fucking movies and video games. This is a cartoon. Buffalo, this is my like,
[2198.18s -> 2203.54s]  this is my sign. The Ox. And they made a funny movie about this. All right, there you go.
[2204.10s -> 2238.25s]  I got it. That looks good, right? Perfect. Little Caesars is good for the price. Don't
[2238.25s -> 2254.10s]  complain about a $5 pizza. Yeah, but, but a $5 pizza is, is not that good. I'm not, I'm just,
[2254.10s -> 2258.10s]  this is not about price. This is about like eating and like how much I want to eat there.
[2258.74s -> 2269.02s]  But it's $5. Right. But that's, it's not down here. This is, so this is almost a C,
[2269.02s -> 2275.82s]  this is almost a D+, C-. To me, this is about like what I would want to eat. Not about like,
[2275.82s -> 2282.07s]  oh, hey. I mean, sometimes it's about like spending less money. But I mean, look,
[2282.07s -> 2286.07s]  I got like Pizza Hut up here. I got like Wendy's at B tier. It's about, it's not about the cost.
[2290.78s -> 2298.57s]  Taco Bell is A for me. It's like a dollar for a taco here. Best thing, oh, I can tell you right
[2298.57s -> 2305.37s]  now. And you're solidifying the reason why it's up here. Cheesy gordita crunch with a Doritos,
[2305.37s -> 2310.81s]  nacho Doritos taco shell is the reason. If that wasn't on the menu, this is down here.
[2312.50s -> 2328.98s]  I swear to fucking God, that menu item brings this from an F to an A. That's the worst menu item.
[2331.08s -> 2336.12s]  You and I got some beef now. We have a problem. That's like the best, that's my favorite thing
[2336.12s -> 2339.00s]  to ever eat at a fast food restaurant. It's the best thing. It's the fucking best thing in the
[2339.00s -> 2347.35s]  world. It's, I want one right now. Cheesy gordita crunch. I will write it down. I'll use my one chat
[2347.35s -> 2384.98s]  message for 30 minutes. I'll make sure you get it. Don't do that though. Tweet it out. No,
[2384.98s -> 2392.94s]  I can't tweet out food stuff anymore because people think I'm like a monster. It's fucking so
[2392.94s -> 2402.57s]  good. All right, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. If I were to do the IHOP no drive through,
[2403.45s -> 2406.81s]  I would stop, I would stop the car and I would turn in if it was a little Caesar's.
[2407.45s -> 2413.13s]  That would, it's what would happen. Where's D'Angelo's? Now that's a really good question
[2413.13s -> 2418.47s]  because D'Angelo's would be up here. Can I just pretend that this is D'Angelo's?
[2418.47s -> 2427.32s]  Quiznos doesn't exist anymore. Where's Papa Gino's? Papa Gino's in D'Angelo's. Papa Gino's,
[2427.32s -> 2430.44s]  I mean it's like a New England thing, but Papa Gino's is some of the best chain pizza I've ever
[2430.44s -> 2444.89s]  had. Papa Gino's is up here or here. Papa Gino's is the best Papa in regards to pizza places.
[2445.45s -> 2452.54s]  That's a New England place, yeah. But that's not fair. In-N-Out's a fucking west coast thing. Why
[2452.54s -> 2459.30s]  is it on here and not Papa Gino's? D'Angelo's, okay, I'm gonna pretend this is D'Angelo's.
[2460.81s -> 2467.59s]  If it's Quiznos, it can stay there, but I'm gonna pretend it's D'Angelo's. I might have to make some
[2467.59s -> 2471.35s]  changes though. All right, so we got, this is important because this is like places that,
[2474.68s -> 2481.93s]  remember, these, it's not about, not Jersey Mike's is so much better than it. No, no, no, no, no,
[2481.93s -> 2488.30s]  but if I'm not gonna stop at, for Jersey Mike's, I'm not gonna like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2491.85s -> 2500.42s]  If I see those, those golden arches, you might get me to stop because of how hungry I am. I'll
[2500.42s -> 2509.90s]  drive by and I'll get just the waft of the dumpster as I'm going through and it'll be really disgusting
[2509.90s -> 2514.14s]  and you'll get that like wet trash smell while you're in the drive-through and you're like, oh,
[2515.51s -> 2523.66s]  and then you keep going and you realize the reward for your dedication. Two plain McChickens with
[2523.66s -> 2554.52s]  mayo and lettuce. Big Mac meal. You can't beat it. It's unbeatable. Can I be honest with you?
[2555.59s -> 2562.12s]  Can I be honest with you, right? These three restaurants are the same restaurant.
[2565.80s -> 2575.02s]  I don't have, they're the same place. That's why they're together. When I think of like
[2575.74s -> 2582.46s]  Whataburger, if I was inside of a steak and shake and you told me it was a Whataburger,
[2583.02s -> 2588.98s]  but the sign said fat burger, I'd be like, this is the, this is the same thing. I, this,
[2588.98s -> 2594.28s]  this is just a cheeseburger. When you're talking about Shake Shack though, that's how you level
[2594.28s -> 2612.97s]  up. We get it. You spin Shake Shack doesn't sponsor anybody. You think Shake Shack needs
[2612.97s -> 2617.61s]  to sponsor somebody? The reason why Taco Bell probably sponsors people is because no, no,
[2617.61s -> 2636.22s]  nevermind. All right, slow down. These two, they even have the same name. Jimmy John's, Jersey
[2636.22s -> 2646.20s]  Mike's. Jersey Jim's like, they're the same fucking restaurant to me. Jim Jersey, Jim John's
[2646.20s -> 2654.70s]  Sub Sandwich Mike. Mike, Jim. It's just two, it's like name and then place. Jim, Mike, Jersey,
[2658.82s -> 2679.27s]  John. Yeah, fuck that. I feel like these are rivals. These are guys that are across the street from
[2679.27s -> 2687.80s]  each other that like prank each other. This is, this is like the, the, the Bob's Burgers made an
[2687.80s -> 2694.81s]  entire like storyline about this and it's real. This is just the other restaurant. This is like
[2694.81s -> 2705.58s]  the, but no, this is way worse than that because this is the same, the same name. Sandwich Shop
[2705.58s -> 2711.54s]  sitcom. Yeah. All right. I'm getting ahead of myself here. That's not fair. Chipotle's at the
[2711.54s -> 2735.26s]  very bottom. I'm sorry. It has to go there. I don't like that place and I'm not going to eat there.
[2735.26s -> 2740.14s]  I'm not going to stop there. I'm not going to stop at Chipotle. Chipotle is not that, it's,
[2740.14s -> 2745.29s]  I'm not going to eat there. They're everywhere. It's next to Starbucks because there's as many
[2745.29s -> 2748.89s]  Chipotle's as there are Starbucks and they're usually right in the same fucking mall,
[2750.34s -> 2772.38s]  connected at the wall together. But which would I rather go in? I can't, I can't have it up at C.
[2776.01s -> 2782.55s]  I understand what, why this would be here. I've had, you know, it's funny. I've had,
[2782.55s -> 2787.58s]  I've had one of these, but they're both the same restaurant to me. So I don't know which one it was.
[2788.14s -> 2794.42s]  I have no fucking idea. It was a sandwich place and it had somebody's name in it.
[2794.42s -> 2803.48s]  It was just, and the signs, they use the same red letters. It's just, I can't have it. I'm sorry.
[2807.34s -> 2811.90s]  Why is KFC a C? We're getting there. Hold on. I got to make sure that this is correct.
[2812.54s -> 2836.26s]  Denny's is way too high. McDonald's and Denny's are up a little too high, I think.
[2850.65s -> 2872.17s]  He just put Burger King in front of In-N-Out. Kim loves In-N-Out. What happened?
[2873.69s -> 2879.18s]  Bro, you just, what, what, what was it? Was it loud? Let me listen to it.
[2880.49s -> 2884.17s]  Show it to me. What was it? Was it loud noise? Was it that, was it that loud? I'm sorry. I didn't
[2884.17s -> 2893.88s]  think it was that loud. Where are my headphones? Was it fucking loud? I just scared the shit out
[2893.88s -> 2925.69s]  of your cat. He just put Burger King in front of In-N-Out. It wasn't that loud. Okay, yeah, it was.
[2926.57s -> 2942.63s]  It was, it was very loud. I just didn't have my volume turned up. Could you believe what he
[2942.63s -> 2956.87s]  fucking did? Did, I saw it. Did you? Wait, what's going on here? Oh, we're fine. But I was saying,
[2956.87s -> 2962.71s]  Kim loves In-N-Out. I think, me not so much. I think it's all right. It's definitely better
[2962.71s -> 2969.03s]  than Burger King. That's a joke. I'm kidding around. Kim said my list is wrong. My list is not done.
[2969.59s -> 2979.88s]  I'm not even close. So hold all criticisms until after it's done. Everybody's talking all this
[2979.96s -> 2998.52s]  smack about my list and they have not. What am I doing? Okay. Um, all right. Instinct. Here we go.
[3013.43s -> 3041.86s]  Yeah. What did Kim say? Where's Kim's cooking? I can't like put, that's not a fast food restaurant.
[3050.97s -> 3055.45s]  Kim making food is not a fast food restaurant. That's not like going driving up to Burger King.
[3056.25s -> 3067.69s]  Are you saying that she's her, she's too slow? No. Kim is not a restaurant. He hates it. I
[3067.69s -> 3078.62s]  haven't even tasted it. I didn't even taste it. I'm talking about like today. No, whatever.
[3080.25s -> 3130.02s]  Cooking's very good. Okay. Let's get back here. This is done. This is done. I feel like I'm playing
[3130.02s -> 3144.84s]  chess. My stream is frozen because I'm just sitting here. Okay. C is done. Now importantly,
[3144.84s -> 3166.23s]  this is like, I might have to make a few changes here. They give me the fries in the bag and the
[3166.23s -> 3174.94s]  fries soak at the bottom of the bag and it gets all oily and shit. They just, oh, I want to fry.
[3178.10s -> 3193.56s]  Here you go. Look, I want French fries. I don't want to eat eight potatoes. I don't like those.
[3193.56s -> 3198.04s]  I don't like the fries. I don't, I like the shitty plastic fries. I like the ones that are
[3198.04s -> 3204.36s]  like dyed yellow, wicked thin shoestring and crispy. I don't like the, I don't like the potato
[3204.36s -> 3207.40s]  like you bite into it and it's like eating a baked potato. No, I'm not a big fan.
[3208.28s -> 3215.46s]  They look, but I don't like potato wedge type fries. I like the fake gross shitty ones and I
[3215.46s -> 3222.17s]  know that that's wrong. I know that this is a wrong opinion, but okay. That's fine. It's also up at B
[3222.17s -> 3227.80s]  tier, which means it's really good. So I don't know what the problem is. This is going to be hard.
[3230.46s -> 3233.74s]  I've had these both the same amount of times and I thought they were both very good.
[3239.35s -> 3243.19s]  They got a sauce. The sauce is better. They got, they have a sauce here. That's better.
[3245.29s -> 3264.94s]  Nothing beats Moe's in this list. I just don't remember eating these. I've never had them.
[3264.94s -> 3269.58s]  Like I've had them once and I thought they were good, but they were the same burger.
[3270.62s -> 3274.46s]  I'm trying to teleport my brain and my memory back to when I ate Whataburger and it was just
[3274.46s -> 3278.46s]  the same thing I did when I ate the other, when I ate it steak and shake. It was just
[3279.66s -> 3285.26s]  I was sitting in the same chair with the same burger and the same flavor. I don't have any
[3285.26s -> 3293.99s]  other memories. I don't have memories for this. They're all the same. I'm looking through like
[3293.99s -> 3303.00s]  the VR goggles of like the burger just going like in, you know, that was his mouth. I don't
[3303.00s -> 3328.38s]  have any other memories. I don't think Five Guys is better though. It's juicier. One of these was
[3328.38s -> 3340.74s]  juicier. I don't remember which one. One of them, one of these was juicier than Five Guys. Cheese
[3340.74s -> 3345.86s]  was melted perfectly at one of these places and I don't remember which one it was.
[3346.50s -> 3370.60s]  Somebody just came in and said in and out C tier. What the fuck? You know, it's only up there.
[3370.60s -> 3378.98s]  It's up a full letter grade because of like it's on stream. You know what I mean? Like
[3380.71s -> 3385.51s]  that's like the, that's like the streamer tax here is no, I don't know. It's pretty good, man.
[3385.51s -> 3394.18s]  It's a pretty cool, pretty awesome place. See in my mind it's over here, but I can't say that. I
[3394.18s -> 3406.98s]  have to say that it's like, okay, I have to say it's good enough. The streamer tax. It's like the
[3406.98s -> 3417.43s]  I'm on camera tax. I'm fucking kidding. In and out is here's the thing I don't like about in and out
[3417.43s -> 3424.06s]  and we're going to talk. We're going to dial the shit talk up to 11. Anytime you go to in and out
[3424.06s -> 3431.21s]  and the burgers are fine. Okay. What do I want to order it in and out? Oh, no, you're doing it wrong.
[3431.21s -> 3437.32s]  Don't order anything off this menu. What, what are you talking about? Why? Well, because there's
[3437.32s -> 3442.04s]  like 30 fucking secret things to order and they're all way better than the stuff on the menu. Why
[3442.04s -> 3447.42s]  don't you just fucking put it on the menu? Oh, uh, animal fries. See what they do is they open up a
[3447.90s -> 3453.74s]  thing of thousand Island dressing and they dump it on your fries and they add like bacon bits to
[3453.74s -> 3471.93s]  it right out of the cabinet. Fucking cool. All right. That's a straw man. These boys are like
[3471.93s -> 3476.25s]  tomato slices. What do they do? They take like tomato slices in like thousand Island dressing
[3477.80s -> 3495.91s]  and then you like pick up the fries and it's like, did you just time? I didn't time out Kim.
[3497.88s -> 3512.09s]  Wait, why did Kim get banned? Wait, what happened? Why did that happen? I'm just
[3512.09s -> 3519.40s]  talking. I'm just taking the piss in and out is fine, but why does it have to be this like
[3519.40s -> 3525.78s]  trendy secret menu thing? Just put it on the menu. They have like three or four different burgers
[3525.78s -> 3533.06s]  that you can order and none. It's just, it's not a secret. Look, it's not a secret when everybody
[3533.06s -> 3541.99s]  knows it. Oh, don't tell anybody about those animal fries that every single fucking customer
[3541.99s -> 3552.54s]  orders. Every single customer orders these. Now tell anybody about that secret. It's a secret menu.
[3559.40s -> 3571.98s]  Don't tell anybody about those animal style fries. Word might get out. All right. We spent
[3571.98s -> 3579.21s]  a lot of time on in and out, but I got a double double animal style is good, but not worth the
[3579.21s -> 3596.50s]  15 minute wait. Oh God mute mute the microphone quick. She brought a dog. You want to say hi to
[3596.50s -> 3608.52s]  Otto? Hello, Otto. You can't time me out in real life. I didn't even time you out. Okay,
[3608.52s -> 3615.51s]  but I don't want to be raised my voice in front of Otto. So what would you change on this? This
[3615.51s -> 3622.04s]  entire list is wrong. How, why is this wrong? Look, I don't know. First of all, what would you replace?
[3622.04s -> 3631.78s]  Okay, you get one thing to replace. Which one is it? See, I told you, I don't want to raise my voice
[3631.78s -> 3641.80s]  in front of Otto. Show dog. No, we only get to see Otto for 10 seconds. All right, so what would you
[3641.80s -> 3648.38s]  change? For a second, I thought you just had a Jersey Mike's t-shirt on and I was like, what the
[3648.38s -> 3659.29s]  fuck are you thinking? Jersey Mike's. Okay, first of all, why is White Castle there? Put it like
[3660.34s -> 3669.21s]  F. White Castle is like a joke restaurant though. White Castle is like a, I thought it said Jersey
[3669.21s -> 3675.98s]  Mike's. All right, White Castle has a movie behind it though. It does? Wait, it does?
[3677.58s -> 3682.54s]  Harold and the two guys go to White Castle. Oh, I've never watched Harold and Kumar.
[3682.54s -> 3685.42s]  Nothing. That's the only reason why it's up here. Otherwise it would be an app.
[3692.14s -> 3697.70s]  I'm not going to read that. All right, so we got, look, way would you put In-N-Out on this list?
[3699.74s -> 3706.04s]  In-N-Out is fucking better than Panera Bread. Is it though? I mean, it's better than
[3706.04s -> 3711.78s]  banana bread and also Panera Bread. Did you say it's better than banana bread?
[3713.86s -> 3717.62s]  All right, yeah. Okay, I'll agree. In-N-Out is better than banana bread, but that's not up here.
[3717.62s -> 3724.26s]  That's not an option. It's better than Panera. Have you ever even had Firehouse Sub? Have you
[3724.26s -> 3731.37s]  ever had a bread bowl soup from Panera? It's better than, you're telling me that an In-N-Out
[3731.37s -> 3736.57s]  burger is better than a bread bowl cheddar broccoli soup from In-N-Out, I mean from Panera. Okay,
[3736.57s -> 3741.42s]  but like it's all bagged soup. What do you think they get this from?
[3741.42s -> 3744.46s]  They think the cow comes in and they're like, oh yeah, bring it in.
[3745.74s -> 3753.56s]  No, they all come out of a fucking bag. Otto, what's your favorite restaurant?
[3757.42s -> 3763.02s]  Oh, that was so cute that he just said that on camera. I mean, also like why is Taco Bell
[3763.02s -> 3768.62s]  like on, wait, okay, so there's an S tier which is Shake Shack and I know that that's true for you.
[3769.42s -> 3775.66s]  Same. But like why is, why is Taco Bell an A-list fast food restaurant?
[3776.94s -> 3779.34s]  Why wouldn't it be? It's got the cheesy gordita crunch with the nachos,
[3779.34s -> 3783.82s]  Doritos, Locos, Taco Bell. Have I ever had a cheesy gordita crunch? Have I ever had that?
[3784.78s -> 3789.58s]  I've never had, she's never had the cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell and she's wanting to talk
[3789.58s -> 3797.24s]  about why it's an A tier. Just saying is, you know, you gotta have, you gotta have a little bit of,
[3798.20s -> 3803.48s]  you gotta have some stuff to eat first before you, I mean, and that's why I have the uneaten side.
[3803.48s -> 3807.24s]  I mean, I've only ever had from Taco Bell, I mean, we had it a couple of nights ago,
[3807.24s -> 3809.56s]  but I ordered the same thing every single time we were going there.
[3810.52s -> 3814.12s]  Because Taco Bell is A tier and you find the thing you like at Taco Bell
[3814.92s -> 3821.19s]  and you eat it every time. That's giving it a high order. I don't know. That's not, this is not correct.
[3821.19s -> 3827.37s]  Is this worth the couch tonight? We're talking about fast food restaurants is not like
[3828.09s -> 3833.37s]  oh yeah, I'm on the couch tonight guys. I can't believe I liked the cheesy
[3833.37s -> 3837.67s]  gordita crunch better than In-N-Out. Where is my cooking on this list?
[3837.67s -> 3844.14s]  Your cooking is all the way up here, up at S, S plus. Okay, but is it better than Shake Shack?
[3844.14s -> 3851.74s]  If I could put another category up here that said S plus, I would and it'd be Kim's fucking perfect
[3851.74s -> 3858.39s]  cooking. But no, but that would be an insult to your cooking because this is a fast food list
[3858.39s -> 3861.91s]  and that would mean that your food would be like in the same realm as a fast food restaurant
[3861.91s -> 3872.02s]  and it's not. Is it home cooked? Wait, you don't like Sonic? Wait, you don't like Sonic?
[3875.72s -> 3881.40s]  Sonic sucks. How many times have you eaten at Sonic? I'm from the East Coast.
[3883.72s -> 3889.08s]  I used to eat Sonic all the time. That's not a quantifiable number of things. Dozens of times.
[3889.72s -> 3896.78s]  Okay, so I've had Sonic twice, so it was not good. Both times I had it, it was not very good.
[3898.14s -> 3903.74s]  It was very, it was very cold. It was, I got, I got cheesy tater tots and it was, they,
[3903.74s -> 3908.46s]  it's almost like they, there was cheesy water tots, what I would have called it. That's a
[3908.46s -> 3911.98s]  cheesy water tots. It's like the funny like laugh out loud term that I'm going to use. Wait,
[3911.98s -> 3917.10s]  you've never had Popeyes before? No. Oh, so fucking good. That's what I'm saying.
[3919.24s -> 3924.84s]  Worst item on the menu is the cheesy tots. Well, they're, that's like in every commercial,
[3924.84s -> 3928.92s]  they're like falling down. There's like cheese going all over the place that you didn't get the
[3928.92s -> 3936.28s]  chili cheese tots. No, I don't want diarrhea. I'm not going to put, adding, guys, adding chili
[3937.08s -> 3944.84s]  to a fast food menu item is giving you like plus 60% chance for diarrhea. Do you get a spicy bum
[3944.84s -> 3973.94s]  from chili? Now we're going to cut the mic. Wait, you've never had this before? Why? Why? Nope.
[3974.58s -> 3981.21s]  We're back. Okay. So, uh. Wait, you've never had, wait, what is this? What is this right here?
[3981.21s -> 3987.82s]  Cash. What is, I don't know what it is. Cashberg. Look, can you see? It looks like Ashburg.
[3988.62s -> 3995.35s]  I thought it. From what I can see. It's Smashburger. Oh, the restaurant that we saw. Oh,
[3995.35s -> 4001.35s]  Smashburger. It's going up here. We've never even had it before. Wait, the restaurant that we saw
[4001.35s -> 4008.10s]  in front of them. Yeah, we've seen it before. Yeah, we've seen it before. We've seen it. I've
[4008.10s -> 4016.86s]  driven by it like three times. This, was there one in Boston? No, I think there's one in LA though.
[4022.02s -> 4031.34s]  We might have seen it when we were there at first. Everything is a burger. You've never had Carl's
[4031.34s -> 4041.96s]  Jr. either? No. I've had Carl's Jr. once. No, this is, look, look, look. You gotta look. This is all,
[4041.96s -> 4050.04s]  this is all the uneaten category. So why is Subway on this list? It's F. Did you see the grade?
[4050.04s -> 4056.20s]  That's an F. That means it's the worst thing on this list. And that's Panda Palace, right?
[4057.40s -> 4067.00s]  This? What is that place? That's Panda Express. Panda Express. It doesn't matter. It's not,
[4067.00s -> 4071.40s]  I don't like it. What's this person? What's this little guy right here? That's Caesar.
[4071.40s -> 4081.45s]  Oh, that's F. He conquered Rome. And what do you mean F? Caesar's pizza? Why would it be,
[4081.45s -> 4085.37s]  this is not F? Have you had it before? Yeah. I've brought an entire box home.
[4086.25s -> 4091.70s]  Wait, have you eaten this before? I didn't eat it, but I brought it home and Alan ate it.
[4092.34s -> 4098.09s]  Have I eaten this? I think you might have. What did I say? I don't know. We threw it in the garbage
[4098.09s -> 4119.64s]  the next day, so I mean. All right. So, all right. All right. So that's little Caesar's apparently.
[4120.76s -> 4131.50s]  All right. Can I, can I finish, can I finish my list? No, because it's wrong.
[4137.05s -> 4142.65s]  Caesar's is, Caesar's is worse than Panda, Panda Land. Why, why can I not think, I can't get the
[4142.65s -> 4153.21s]  name of this place in my brain? Panda Express. Right. Wow. All right. Do we have any coffee
[4153.21s -> 4157.85s]  downstairs? What time is it? It's 10 o'clock. I shouldn't be asking for coffee. Do you want some?
[4160.07s -> 4237.29s]  All right. I'm going to get a coffee. Okay. Pot of coffee is going on. Where's mine? Oh,
[4237.29s -> 4252.38s]  fuck. Okay. There we go. What was that like frame? So I think I have confirmed that was not little
[4252.38s -> 4260.57s]  Caesar's. That was a local place. It's going back up. I actually remember the name of the place.
[4261.29s -> 4276.62s]  That's kind of a similar name. Why is little, I, I was misled. I have not had it before. I've had it
[4276.62s -> 4289.21s]  like twice. I've won it though. I've won it. Then it's uneaten. No, but I have eaten it though.
[4289.21s -> 4296.31s]  Back in Massachusetts, I've had it like a bunch, at least twice. What's this, what was this emote?
[4308.84s -> 4368.82s]  I'm going to finish my list. Okay. It looks good. It's done. This is my emote list. Wait,
[4368.82s -> 4444.74s]  just got here. What the fuck is this? What's, what's wrong with this? That's it. That's done.
[4444.74s -> 4475.54s]  Perfect. I was fighting with that the whole time. So let's get this straight. Panda Panda Panda.
[4475.54s -> 4486.36s]  Is it Panda Express? Panda Express is the worst restaurant I've ever been to on this list.
[4498.63s -> 4504.17s]  Restaurant. No, it's not better. Is it better than Subway? It might be. No,
[4504.81s -> 4518.39s]  it's worse than Pizza Hut. Yeah, by about two letter grades. Is it worse than McDonald's? Yeah.
[4518.39s -> 4527.59s]  I mean, I've had better experiences from McDonald's. Fuck. Is it? Domstick with my list.
[4541.18s -> 4555.16s]  All right. That's good. Any other lists to do? What is this? What is this? File maker,
[4555.16s -> 4567.51s]  file maker, file maker. What is this? Wait, why is there a, that's, I think, okay. I thought that
[4567.51s -> 4581.56s]  said FileMaker.com. Okay. This is my emotes. I have to write my emotes. Don't make me do this.
[4582.60s -> 4596.10s]  Actually, this is going to be pretty easy. Okay. Copy that link. Let's go here and it should just
[4596.10s -> 4640.15s]  go, right? Let's go. Okay. I'm just preliminarily getting them out here. A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D.
[4640.15s -> 4656.92s]  We need a F tier. No, there's no, there are, there are no F tier emotes. I'm going to say,
[4656.92s -> 4680.79s]  I would put, how did you make this? I'm actively right now going through the process that I said
[4680.79s -> 4686.68s]  I wanted to go through a long time ago. And that was, I want to go for what emotes I think are the
[4686.68s -> 4692.54s]  better ones and which ones are the worst ones. So thank you for, let, let's do it. We're doing
[4692.54s -> 4740.34s]  it on stream. All right. Can't, you can't touch those two. This is preliminarily. I like the
[4740.34s -> 4762.70s]  top F of the Jupiter better than the bottom half. Let me think. Let me think. Let me think. Let me
[4762.70s -> 4793.53s]  think. All right. Hold on. That's correct. I don't need to do any changing here. I would,
[4793.53s -> 4799.32s]  I would probably say, look, just because it's used the most doesn't mean I think it is the best.
[4802.04s -> 4815.94s]  Still up there. I really do. I kind of like, I like the one guy where it is.
[4816.66s -> 4852.95s]  What do I think is the board? Which one is so close to being dropped? The TV has no purpose.
[4852.95s -> 4874.30s]  It just doesn't. This, this is no purpose for the TV. Honestly, I've, I like mustard more than I like.
[4875.26s -> 4885.11s]  Yeah. Can I, can anybody even do that emote? Anybody here even have the capability to do
[4885.11s -> 4901.59s]  that emote? Can I even do that emote? Oh yeah. Speaking of subscription emotes,
[4902.15s -> 4908.20s]  Tingy just came in with 10 community subs. Thank you, Tingy. Ten. Count them. Ten community subs
[4910.41s -> 4916.65s]  on top of the fucking hundreds at this point, I think. Thank you, Tingy. That's a shitload
[4916.65s -> 4921.69s]  of fucking money and I'm surprised that you want to give me that kind of support. Thank you. That
[4921.69s -> 4932.01s]  means a lot. There are people that, there are people that can do that in the chat. I'm, I'm,
[4932.01s -> 4941.37s]  I'm comfortable with this. Find out whoever did that and ban them. I think, I like this. I don't
[4941.37s -> 4954.66s]  do very much. I already know all of my children here. I mean, I have to do this. This has to be
[4954.66s -> 4964.84s]  complete. Otherwise it'll, it'll freak me the fuck out. I think that's good. That's, that's pretty
[4964.84s -> 4970.73s]  good S and A tier here. Like, I mean, these are, these one, two, three, four, five, six, this,
[4970.73s -> 4983.50s]  that's a pretty good, that's pretty good. I would probably go like this though, like that. I think
[4983.50s -> 4991.34s]  that's perfect the way it is. I've judged, this is fun to do. I think I'm going to do this again.
[4992.06s -> 5002.94s]  Did it really take me an hour to do that McDonald's tier thing? Nobody uses Germapop. That doesn't
[5002.94s -> 5020.23s]  mean it's not the best emote on the channel. What tier, what tier would a, a stream tier?
[5021.03s -> 5032.73s]  What do you mean? He likes his own face. No, that's up there because that's the first emote I ever
[5032.73s -> 5041.30s]  had. And I still think it's the best one. This one, just by sheer volume, that's probably the
[5041.30s -> 5046.81s]  most used emote in the whole channel. And I think it's, I think I did a pretty good job on that.
[5048.01s -> 5077.30s]  I did a close-up of my face and that's it. Now it's perfect. Now it is. No, now it is. No, it's not.
[5086.01s -> 5103.77s]  Now it's perfect. About touching anymore. No, it's perfect the way it is. Perfect the way it is.
[5103.77s -> 5118.78s]  Don't need to do anything else. All right, guys. I think that's time to go. I'll see you tomorrow.
[5121.37s -> 5127.35s]  Me and Styr are going to do something tomorrow afternoon. I don't know what the hell it is,
[5127.35s -> 5134.09s]  but we're going to do something. Some type of multiplayer game. And if not, then look,
[5134.09s -> 5141.00s]  we're going to have to figure something out because we both agreed. Hey, let's do something. Let's do
[5141.00s -> 5146.74s]  a vid, a stream together. That'd be fun. So something's going to happen tomorrow between
[5146.74s -> 5153.75s]  3 and 4 p.m. Pacific time. Thanks for watching. I'll get out of the way now. There's your final
[5153.75s -> 5170.89s]  list there. And that's a nice place to call it, I think. I think so. That was Sam and Max Season 3,
[5170.89s -> 5181.13s]  Episode 1. We will return to that probably next week because tomorrow is me and Styr doing
[5181.13s -> 5185.05s]  something. And then a few days later we'll probably do, I have a couple of ideas.
[5185.13s -> 5199.45s]  So you will see Episode 2 sooner than you think. I'm scrolling down the list of bits right now,
[5199.45s -> 5207.54s]  and there are a shitload. There are a ton of bits. There are hundreds and hundreds of them.
[5209.05s -> 5219.64s]  All trying to bring the score down. Minus two. Oh, there's so many here.
[5221.78s -> 5238.36s]  Hahaha. Holy shit. The Google search results for cheesy godita crunch have increased by 300%
[5238.36s -> 5252.49s]  in the last hour. Good. I hope you eat one. But let's go back to earlier. Thank you for
[5252.49s -> 5257.58s]  joining me on this stream. And if you take it off, maybe we'll see you tomorrow. If not,
[5257.58s -> 5272.22s]  we'll see you again soon, maybe. So we had $2.50 from Zake. Thank you, Zake. Thanks for buying food
[5272.22s -> 5277.02s]  for my family every day ever since our dad left. You're a good man. I just don't think that eating
[5277.02s -> 5287.94s]  only cheesy Cheetos for five months straight is very healthy. Thank you for the $2.50. Appreciate it.
[5292.81s -> 5300.73s]  Thank you to Red Ramen for the $10. Ten bucks. Vod boy here. Watch out chat.
[5300.73s -> 5307.74s]  Jerma has a real knee slapper coming up. Oh, that's a Vod watcher. I see.
[5322.78s -> 5339.86s]  Thank you, Red Ramen. Enjoy the Vod. It's a good one. It's a good one. Hey, back in thanks
[5339.86s -> 5352.94s]  for the four dollars. Uh, they say minus two. There are a lot now. Uh, 25 cent bits that have
[5353.58s -> 5359.66s]  minus two. It is more than probably 50. 25 cent bits that say minus two.
[5360.62s -> 5371.21s]  Minus two. Minus, minus, minus, minus, minus, minus, minus, minus. Somebody did a plus two.
[5374.71s -> 5379.75s]  Uh, more minuses. I wonder what this fucking chart would look like. This is one you're gonna,
[5379.75s -> 5382.15s]  you're gonna want to look at that one. Somebody's gonna want to chart this one.
[5383.03s -> 5392.26s]  Somebody said have fun getting rich, clever streamer. Oh, Espada. Espada Escalata gave
[5392.26s -> 5401.24s]  two dollars and fifty cents in the middle of that and they say minus two. More of that. More,
[5401.24s -> 5410.36s]  more, more. It then turns into halfway through up here it turns into for a 25 cent minus two
[5410.36s -> 5420.36s]  bit messages to 25 cent 750 people subscribe to the channel. My, my weightlifting sub copy pasta.
[5421.32s -> 5429.56s]  Like 50 times here. Uh, Espada Escalata thanks for the 250. Chad Germa puts down the minus two
[5429.56s -> 5435.16s]  insurrection with videos of him getting ripped but spawns a copy pasta to rival Germacraft. Now
[5435.16s -> 5453.64s]  that's a plus two material. There's more, there's more of this. This went on for a while. It was 30
[5453.64s -> 5461.72s]  straight minutes of slow mo. Germa lied about Taco Bell. Hello, Germa lied about Taco Bell.
[5461.72s -> 5470.22s]  How are you? I put your restaurant at a tier and it was the only one that was there. Congratulations.
[5470.78s -> 5479.80s]  Uh, Germa, I just got here. What the fuck happened? I don't even remember. I remember it was,
[5479.80s -> 5496.65s]  it was also wrong. That's okay, you can think that. What was that laugh? That was a laugh to rival
[5496.65s -> 5506.12s]  Beavis and Butthead. It was all a blur before the tier lists. It kind of was, weirdly enough.
[5507.08s -> 5513.43s]  It was. It really was. I don't even remember any of the, I don't remember any of Sam and Max.
[5513.43s -> 5522.38s]  Did we play it? Hey, Twunkstee1 thanks for the 250. This is somebody's first Germa stream. Well,
[5522.38s -> 5529.21s]  every one of my streams is somebody's first stream. Let's just hope that they come in while
[5529.21s -> 5539.59s]  I'm just hanging out having a good time. Hey, Mad at 47 thanks for the 15 dollars. 15 bucks from Mad.
[5539.59s -> 5550.58s]  Can you still curl those 35s or are you too old? I can't do it. It's just 21. I'll remember. I like,
[5550.58s -> 5567.35s]  I just add, no, I say Twunkstee21. No, I can't do that anymore. I could probably barely do 15 to 20
[5567.35s -> 5576.87s]  pounds 10 times on each hand. It's been too long, but I did use the love working out. I felt great,
[5577.51s -> 5593.99s]  but thank you for the 15 dollars, Mad. Appreciate it. More 25 set bits that,
[5595.51s -> 5599.59s]  I just want to read one. Just checking if you can skip the 30 minute wait time.
[5600.97s -> 5607.03s]  You're gonna get so much minus two when this is done. I kind of didn't though. It only happened
[5607.03s -> 5624.74s]  for about five seconds. We also had, oh my god, there's so many of these. You did this to yourself.
[5625.54s -> 5630.98s]  Is this a scam to make people pay money? How many people made alt accounts to say,
[5630.98s -> 5641.83s]  fuck you right now? Jerma's dumb. We are winning. Hey Jerma, when's the next TF2 vid?
[5641.83s -> 5648.10s]  That is the one that came through. Uh, plus W plus thanks for the five dollars.
[5648.82s -> 5652.74s]  Jerma, thank you for sharing your wonderful personality with the world. I said this before
[5652.74s -> 5657.86s]  as my one chat message, but you didn't read it so now I have to say it. I have to pay to say it.
[5658.10s -> 5666.18s]  Well thank you for the five dollars, and thank you for listening. Thank you for being here.
[5667.22s -> 5680.31s]  Without you there is no me. In a streamer sense. If there wasn't people watching,
[5680.31s -> 5697.54s]  I don't think I would have kept doing it. So, works both ways. Thank you. We also see, let's see,
[5698.34s -> 5704.12s]  one of these 25 cents that came in is funny. It says, you can't focus on the game because chat is
[5704.12s -> 5726.26s]  too slow and engaging. Nice bit extortion. It's just a ruse. When the streamer does a 30 minute
[5726.26s -> 5735.35s]  bit for money, Jerma disgust. Viewers dropping, low engagement, sell, sell, sell.
[5740.47s -> 5752.22s]  Let me out of the jar, I'm suffocating. Release me. How do I grow up to rule Twitch chat with a
[5752.30s -> 5758.46s]  fist of iron like yours? Shave your armpits. Armpit shaving stream. Shave armpits.
[5759.34s -> 5770.30s]  These are all 25 cent donations that came in. Somebody says, fuck you. Baskin Robbins mom's
[5770.30s -> 5775.42s]  baking cookies ice cream is a mother's day only ice cream. I went into Baskin Robbins and I looked
[5775.42s -> 5798.68s]  like a fool. What? No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not, is it? No, it's there. It's there.
[5807.03s -> 5813.35s]  Dude, I've looked for that ice cream in six stores. I can't find it. Really? No, it's there. You're
[5813.35s -> 5826.47s]  gonna get it. It's definitely not seasonal. Hey, AzzyDreamer, thanks for the five community subs.
[5827.77s -> 5833.61s]  Welcome. Thank you. And congratulations to the five lucky contestants that got the community subs.
[5833.61s -> 5849.19s]  Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks for the five subs. Somebody has a question here. Somebody,
[5849.19s -> 5853.99s]  this is one of the random just 25 cent like just, it was just flowing in here.
[5855.90s -> 5860.70s]  Really not the best place to ask this question, but I'm gonna answer it because it's a strange
[5860.70s -> 5865.66s]  place to put this. In the middle of the 25 cent spam, there's somebody that says, I'm looking for
[5865.66s -> 5871.42s]  a lost video, Jerma. Where's that Twitter video of a star wasting a bunch of money he won from
[5871.42s -> 5879.64s]  You and a Bet on McChickens? I can't find it. I don't, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[5879.64s -> 5887.72s]  I don't know what you mean. I don't know. I don't know. I don't recall that Twitter video.
[5888.36s -> 5899.14s]  I don't know what that means. I'm sorry. Hey, Demoniccucumber, thanks for the 250.
[5899.70s -> 5904.74s]  Why did you empty your Google Play wallet on Twitch bits? I'm sorry, mom. I had to tell my
[5904.74s -> 5922.54s]  favorite streamer how much he sucked with them. Thank you for the $10 from, uh, Poopookie? It's
[5922.54s -> 5932.63s]  uh, Pookey? Pookey? Pookey? I think. You pick, yup. Just like that Nickelodeon you pick. Get your
[5932.63s -> 5937.83s]  toll-free phone out and dial 1-800. You pick Nickelodeon. Press 1 for Doug. Press 2 for
[5937.83s -> 5951.78s]  Ren and Stimpy. Press 3 for OurRealMonsters. You pick. Well, what's the... Did I say this like two
[5951.78s -> 5966.44s]  weeks ago? I mean, that's a real thing. Well, thank you to the $10 regardless, Pookey. Demoniccucumber,
[5966.44s -> 5971.24s]  thanks for the $3. Based on how Twitch searches their chats, you're gonna get your account flagged
[5971.24s -> 5979.64s]  for botting because of this stupid bit. Nah, I'll be all right. They got fucking data. All they need
[5979.64s -> 5995.58s]  is the data and they have good to go. This is like when each text used to cost money. Us boomers are
[5995.58s -> 6011.32s]  used to this. We're calling collect to chat. That's a good one. That's right. I can only do
[6011.32s -> 6031.93s]  this twice, so I better make this count. Did you? No, you didn't. And yes, that was the second
[6033.13s -> 6051.82s]  message. Maybe it was worth it. Swiggity swanky, thanks to the $5. This all started when you
[6051.82s -> 6059.90s]  encouraged chat by noticing the memes. Don't you realize you are an enabler of chat? If you started
[6059.90s -> 6065.10s]  going on a tirade about peepee poo poo, chat would go insane. You went off the rails with this one,
[6065.10s -> 6070.62s]  big boy. I estimate that this damage you've helped create will last only a few weeks,
[6070.62s -> 6080.38s]  so nothing permanent, like hair loss. And they fucking had a... ready? Really? Another gnome
[6080.38s -> 6091.19s]  link. Thank you. This is from C4G, thanks to the $5. Hey, Jerma, I think this is the end of the bot.
[6091.19s -> 6095.43s]  It had a good weird run and this was a perfect finale for it. Thanks for letting it stick around
[6095.43s -> 6106.18s]  for so long. Absolutely, there's a link. Okay, thank you for the $5. I really appreciate that.
[6106.18s -> 6114.66s]  Add the bot. Why? The bot doesn't have to go yet. The bot can stay here. The bot's fucking awesome.
[6115.22s -> 6120.18s]  It's a great idea. Yeah, maybe after a little while it might, maybe it'll start to derail
[6120.18s -> 6125.96s]  streams, but I like the derailment that it does now, so it's okay. Thank you for even contributing
[6125.96s -> 6135.18s]  that at all. That was C4G. $5. Thank you. Master Chicken, thanks for the $2.50. There's a link.
[6135.18s -> 6140.87s]  Let's click it. Thank you. Jerma, I've been watching you since the first days of TF2 with Star,
[6140.87s -> 6144.07s]  and this is the first time I've had money to donate. Just want to say that you've been a
[6144.07s -> 6148.95s]  constant positive part of my life. Also, if you don't do the Jerma, where's Waldo? I'll be mildly
[6148.95s -> 6160.82s]  upset. I probably will just do that, don't worry. Thank you, Master Chicken. Absolutely. We will do
[6160.82s -> 6168.74s]  that. It sounds like a lot of fun. This next one is a $5 donation from somebody. They have
[6168.74s -> 6181.19s]  just a link. Let's click it. Nice. And it says, thank you. Thank you. No, let me just click the
[6181.19s -> 6192.89s]  next four or five links in a row. Okay. There's no more links after that, so I'm done with clicking
[6192.89s -> 6206.62s]  links. E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you for the $2.50. Let's see what this is. It's a link.
[6206.62s -> 6219.10s]  Let's click it. E-word. Hold on. What's his name? Hold on. E-word, twerty, word, twerty.
[6219.74s -> 6229.29s]  On PC, please. Thank you. Probably. Not. I don't see why not. Probably. Unless, of course,
[6229.29s -> 6234.65s]  there's a reason why I wouldn't. Tomorrow, not the next day. Probably not. Not. On legendary mode.
[6234.65s -> 6241.43s]  Just kidding. Delete that. Demons V, thanks for the $5. Thank you. Jerma lied about Halo.
[6243.37s -> 6248.17s]  He tends to do that. Thank you, though. E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you for that.
[6250.54s -> 6261.99s]  Thank you. E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Nailed it. Okay, guess who? Another $2.50 from
[6263.27s -> 6271.06s]  E-word, twerty, word, twerty. What is this? E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thanks for the $5,
[6271.06s -> 6277.29s]  Jerma. It's the same clip. Well, it's the same clip twice. I think that maybe they thought they
[6277.29s -> 6280.25s]  screwed it up on the first one, but you got it on the first one. Thanks for the $5 total.
[6280.25s -> 6287.66s]  Dr. Clay, thanks for the $2.50. I thought this was your voice for a second.
[6322.79s -> 6330.15s]  Uh, E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you for the $2.50. And thank you, Dr. Clay.
[6330.71s -> 6337.98s]  Jerma lied about Taco Bell thanks for the $3. I have never seen a Panda Express outside of a mall
[6337.98s -> 6383.86s]  food court. I know. Uh, Panda, Panda Pal. No, it's Panda, it's, I can't, I cannot say this.
[6383.86s -> 6392.66s]  It has to be a different second word every time. Panda Express, Panda Land, Panda Palace, Panda
[6394.04s -> 6402.90s]  Time. Like it has to be, I cannot say Express every time, but I really do have to say a very
[6402.90s -> 6415.62s]  special thank you to, uh, E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you to KXZ for the 30 bucks.
[6419.26s -> 6426.62s]  $30 from KXZ on top of the other huge drops of money from KXZ. Your average Taco Bell meal is
[6426.62s -> 6441.32s]  just a biological war crime waiting to happen. What the fuck? Thank you. Taco Bell is good.
[6441.32s -> 6450.46s]  One item. Other items on the list? Sure. I've ordered a taco from Taco Bell before,
[6451.34s -> 6458.22s]  and it may have well have just been nachos because it was just crushed up lettuce and stale, gross
[6459.26s -> 6467.10s]  shell with meat dumped on it. It may have, you probably stepped on it, like stomped on it
[6467.10s -> 6474.23s]  before giving it to me. You order a cheesy Gordita Crunch, which I'm going to do right now.
[6474.79s -> 6478.23s]  No, I'm not. No, I'm not eating taco. No, I have this rule
[6479.03s -> 6484.87s]  where I can't eat fast food more than once every like couple weeks. I can't do that. No.
[6485.59s -> 6496.82s]  But thank you KXZ for the huge amount of money. Appreciate it.
[6497.46s -> 6502.01s]  Jerma lied about Taco Bell thanks to the 250. Come on man, I was trying to let the
[6502.01s -> 6513.00s]  Jerma lied meme die and then you go and rate Taco Bell an A. Uh, Phylactery Lich gave 50 bucks
[6513.00s -> 6518.46s]  earlier that I missed, and I'm sorry I missed it, but they said you take this money to Popeyes
[6519.02s -> 6526.15s]  and educate yourself. I will. I will go get the biggest bucket of chicken that they sell at Popeyes
[6526.71s -> 6534.33s]  and I will eat it off stream. Thank you for the 50 dollars Phylactery.
[6536.78s -> 6543.26s]  Really appreciate that. It's a lot of fucking money. Thank you. I have to go get the Cajun fries? Sure.
[6543.26s -> 6550.33s]  I'll try them. Hey Dork Cube thanks for the 250. Well now that you've poked the dragon with fast
[6550.33s -> 6556.17s]  food discussion, shout out to all the Cook Out and Vojangles fans. You should do a frozen food
[6556.17s -> 6563.48s]  tier list next. I might be able to guess who's number one. I would do those. That was fun just
[6563.48s -> 6574.23s]  to kind of sit there for an hour. I liked that. That was cool. I had a lot of fun. Kid Cuisine S tier.
[6574.23s -> 6579.43s]  Kid Cuisine is definitely F tier. You would probably get more nutrients eating dirt from the
[6579.43s -> 6587.24s]  ground. Your father's grass clippings will probably keep you going more than Kid Cuisine will.
[6587.96s -> 6596.97s]  Just stir up your father's grass clippings from the lawn and just stir it into water and drink it.
[6596.97s -> 6612.46s]  I'm sure that would be probably better for you. That was my childhood you monster? Me too. Hungry
[6612.46s -> 6621.32s]  man. All jokes aside, I really don't think I could do a frozen food list because I haven't
[6621.32s -> 6630.71s]  eaten them in such a long time. I don't eat frozen like microwavable dinners. I would not be able to
[6630.71s -> 6639.21s]  do that list. Should I eat a bunch of them before we do that? Why am I saying like this isn't going
[6639.21s -> 6657.34s]  to happen? Hey bake me home thanks for the 250. Take a shower you smell. I might. Oh maybe. I don't
[6657.34s -> 6671.70s]  think I do. No I got I got the odor on. I'm fine. But thank you bake me home. Thank you true proxy
[6671.70s -> 6675.86s]  for the ten bucks. Thank you Jerm for always giving me the most genuine laughs of all. Have a
[6675.86s -> 6682.10s]  thousand bits. I will very graciously take them. Thank you so much true proxy for the ten dollars
[6682.10s -> 6688.02s]  one thousand bits. I will gladly take them. Thank you. A watt fridge thanks to the five bucks. The
[6688.02s -> 6691.70s]  secret menu exists because they haven't changed their actual menu since the day they opened
[6692.50s -> 6696.02s]  and it's sort of a key part of their business model. Same how their prices barely change year
[6696.02s -> 6706.97s]  to year. Yeah but at what point does does the actual menu be trumped by the secret menu?
[6709.70s -> 6714.18s]  When when your menu of the secret menu is bigger than the actual menu
[6715.59s -> 6735.77s]  don't you think you should like switch them around? Uh thank you milkshake for the three
[6735.77s -> 6741.13s]  dollars. In and out is S tier. In and out is S tier. In and out is S tier. In and out is S tier.
[6741.13s -> 6756.01s]  In and out is S tier. I you guys thought I was making that up when I was like screeching and like
[6757.21s -> 6765.91s]  like wringing. I told you you're not allowed to say in and out is bad. That's why it has the
[6765.91s -> 6770.79s]  streamer text that I'm on camera streamer text of it being in the like high somewhere in seas.
[6782.87s -> 6788.82s]  In and out is all right. It is. I would eat in and out if somebody said let's go to in and out.
[6788.82s -> 6799.53s]  I'd be like yeah fucking that sounds pretty good. Man I would also skydive if I had I could build
[6799.53s -> 6810.31s]  up enough like the courage to do that too right? Kidding it's all right it's just a hamburger.
[6811.11s -> 6838.62s]  Jeremiah Shake Shack is overrated. You've never had it before. You've never had it before. And by
[6838.62s -> 6843.10s]  the way Shake Shack has a better chicken sandwich than most restaurants that specialize in chicken
[6843.10s -> 6849.02s]  sandwiches. They got a twofer. Better chicken sandwiches than most of the chicken sandwich
[6849.02s -> 6863.80s]  restaurants. Better burgers than the burger restaurants. Come on try it if you have it's
[6863.80s -> 6877.37s]  available. All right you know you got me there. You got me there. Shake Shack the the fries at
[6877.37s -> 6889.77s]  Shake Shack are dog shit. Yeah still S tier though because they spend so much time with
[6889.77s -> 6895.45s]  so much effort crafting such incredible quality sandwiches that something has to get left behind.
[6895.45s -> 6902.78s]  And do you really care if the fries aren't that great? All right the fries from Five Guys and the
[6902.78s -> 6913.03s]  fries from Shake Shack. It's the afterthought. You just don't order the fries then. Just get two
[6913.03s -> 6919.93s]  sandwiches. Fries aren't good for you anyways. It's just starch and oil. You don't you shouldn't
[6919.93s -> 6932.94s]  even order them anyways. Get two get a chicken sandwich and get a hamburger. What are the best
[6932.94s -> 6940.74s]  fries? That's actually pretty easy. The best french fries you can possibly get from a fast food
[6940.74s -> 6959.59s]  restaurant McDonald's right when they come out. If they're fresh McDonald's fresh fries are better.
[6961.56s -> 6967.00s]  Burger King is pretty close if they're fresh. Burger King fries are really close if they're
[6967.00s -> 6974.10s]  fresh. I would say Burger King's are the best but here's the issue Burger King's fries are never
[6974.10s -> 6981.86s]  fresh. That's like a one in 100 chance and unless you're feeling pretty lucky I wouldn't do it.
[6985.88s -> 6995.75s]  You get the fresh Burger King fries though. Hard to beat. Wendy's fries. Wendy's fries are good.
[6996.39s -> 7000.65s]  I think I would put them they're pretty standard. Should we go back to the list and do fries only?
[7001.45s -> 7012.60s]  Do a fry test. I would do that. That sounds like a good idea. I'm gonna do a fry taste test. I'm
[7012.60s -> 7027.99s]  gonna get fries from Shake Shack, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, In-N-Out. Popeyes has fries.
[7028.87s -> 7044.63s]  Interesting. They won't be fresh? Yeah they will. Thank you. Jerma lied about Taco Bell for the 250th.
[7044.63s -> 7047.51s]  Do you ever accidentally call your streamer friends by their twitch channels? That's all
[7047.51s -> 7057.62s]  they called. I don't call them anything else. I know Star as Star. That's what I say to them
[7057.62s -> 7066.76s]  in actual in real life. Talix is a Talix. Talix. The only reason why I call Kim Kim is because Kim
[7066.76s -> 7091.58s]  is her username. You know what I'm saying? Try the other um Incredible Orb. Hey that's Orb. Hey
[7091.58s -> 7101.29s]  Orb! Hey Orb! Orb! Orb! I don't call him by his first name. Boo yeah. Boo is just boo.
[7102.62s -> 7124.30s]  Boo. That is how it happens usually. Demons V thanks to the five dollars. Appreciate the five
[7124.30s -> 7143.14s]  dollars. You called Nova James before. Isn't that what people call them? It's usually by like what
[7143.14s -> 7150.90s]  like people call you in your community is what I usually go by. It's actually easier to remember
[7150.90s -> 7161.42s]  people's handles than it is to remember their names. Interestingly enough because they could
[7161.42s -> 7174.98s]  be like a hundred Johns but you know there's only one. Excommunicado three right? That's the
[7174.98s -> 7186.66s]  that's the only person with that name. You could be like one of 20 Dan's or Dave's that I know
[7187.54s -> 7207.91s]  or you could be the Strangler 49444. That's just who you are. Hey uh RTM thanks for the five dollars.
[7208.55s -> 7211.19s]  Just want to say thank you for bringing some laughter and joy to me in an otherwise shitty
[7211.19s -> 7216.95s]  day. We had to put my father's dog down today and I've not been taking it well. Watching the stream
[7216.95s -> 7227.77s]  and reading chat has helped me so thank you. I'm terribly sorry to hear that. Losing an animal is
[7228.97s -> 7236.30s]  tough. It sucks. I really hope that that dog was able to live a nice good long life
[7237.82s -> 7245.37s]  and if it was for other circumstances then hopefully the time that the dog did have was
[7245.37s -> 7250.49s]  full of love. So I'm really sorry to hear that. Thank you for the five dollars and by all means
[7251.21s -> 7260.57s]  absolutely we are very very happy to take your mind off it. Sorry to hear that.
[7265.53s -> 7278.20s]  Thank you for the five dollars. We also had a ten dollars come in from Azzy Dreamer on top of the
[7278.20s -> 7282.95s]  I believe community subs that came in as well from Azzy. Thanks for all you do Jerma. I've watched
[7282.95s -> 7286.79s]  you since TF2 days and watching on YouTube helped me through so much of my darkest times in my life
[7287.19s -> 7301.13s]  have a good one. You as well. You have a good one too. Thanks for watching for that long. Yesterday
[7302.15s -> 7309.51s]  uh reminiscing and watching some old videos and watching maybe mention TF2 I really do like miss
[7309.51s -> 7319.00s]  that stuff. You you almost like you plant yourself back five six seven eight years ago. It's like oh
[7319.00s -> 7329.22s]  this was fucking a ton of fun but then I think about now and this shit's a ton of fucking fun too
[7330.33s -> 7336.89s]  five ten years from now I'll be looking back to this stuff going oh that was a great time.
[7337.45s -> 7341.37s]  That was a lot of fun. Remember when we did that? Well that was great. That was so cool.
[7343.58s -> 7347.02s]  So it works always sort of in perpetuity when you look backwards.
[7348.06s -> 7359.80s]  So thank you for the ten bucks. Thanks for sticking around for that long and I hope to
[7359.80s -> 7364.44s]  see you around more. Hopefully you stick around even longer because there's so much more going on
[7364.44s -> 7374.63s]  to do. Thank you though. Let's get the community subs. There were a lot of them today
[7375.74s -> 7385.19s]  on top of the all of the bit donations that came through and of course the regular resubs and the
[7385.19s -> 7390.73s]  new subs people that just didn't get a community sub. Community subs come through so often now
[7391.85s -> 7398.79s]  that it's almost like they're taking a huge huge portion of actual subbed people to the channel.
[7400.76s -> 7407.24s]  So that's thank you for that. Whoever whoever you are whenever you do it that's some of you
[7407.24s -> 7416.15s]  guys are responsible for tens, dozens, hundreds of people on the channel. So really appreciate it.
[7418.02s -> 7441.00s]  Why don't we show all those names now? Here are tonight's subs. Thank you. Somebody says it's
[7441.00s -> 7445.24s]  gonna be weird when I've been watching Jerma since I was 12 and be like 30 in 10 years.
[7446.20s -> 7458.18s]  Now you know that that works both ways right? That means I'll be 44. Don't really want to think
[7458.18s -> 7471.72s]  about that. I don't even want to think about 35 because I've mentioned this before but I'm at
[7471.72s -> 7479.46s]  that stage right now where I don't get to pick the 18 to 34 drop down box anymore. One more year
[7480.26s -> 7486.26s]  and I've got to do the thing I have never done and that's pick the one 35 to 55.
[7496.42s -> 7500.34s]  There are a couple more bits to do. We have Internet Jorge
[7501.38s -> 7509.05s]  for the $15 from Internet Jorge. Take my offering so that us peasants may never suffer your wrath
[7509.05s -> 7527.58s]  again. Wrath. If I was a seven deadly sin what would I be? Pride. I don't think so. Sloth?
[7528.54s -> 7546.17s]  No, I'm sorry. Pride. Lust. Greed. Envy. Pride. Lust. Wrath. Greed. Envy. Gluttony.
[7547.13s -> 7561.26s]  Pride. Lust. Pride. Pride. Lust. Rage. Greed. No, Pride. Lust. Wrath. Greed. Gluttony. Envy.
[7562.14s -> 7576.18s]  What's the other one? Pride. Lust. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy.
[7576.18s -> 7596.15s]  Who am I missing? I have to write them down. Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Gluttony. Greed.
[7597.26s -> 7603.98s]  Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Wrath. Pride. Lust. Envy. Is that seven?
[7607.34s -> 7625.94s]  Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Envy. What's the- Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed.
[7625.94s -> 7647.30s]  Gluttony. Lust. Envy. That's six. No, it's not. Is that seven? Okay. Which one would I be?
[7649.64s -> 7656.23s]  The eighth sin. But what I was trying to say, somebody said short. Oh yeah. Wrath. Pride. Sloth.
[7656.23s -> 7673.75s]  Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Envy. Short. Funny. I think I would be a combination of- I don't think I have
[7673.75s -> 7680.98s]  any of these things. How come there's no seven awesome sins? You know? Like, how come- why is
[7680.98s -> 7685.06s]  it- why is there not like a holy equivalent to this? What is it? The Ten Commandments, right?
[7686.02s -> 7692.02s]  Instead of the seven deadly sins, where are like the seven things- cool things to do?
[7695.19s -> 7700.39s]  Oops, I tried to hit enter to like do another one. The seven virtues. Okay, wait. Seven virtues. What
[7700.39s -> 7709.90s]  are they? Let's see if- okay. Chastity. Temperance. Charity. Diligence. Patience. Kindness.
[7709.90s -> 7737.14s]  And humility. Where's like Jack? Temperance. Charity. Diligence. Patience. Do a tier list
[7737.14s -> 7752.10s]  of the sins and the virtues. No, not tonight. Maybe we'll do it again. Maybe we'll do it again
[7752.10s -> 7768.42s]  another night. Books of the Bible tier list. What are you- you trying to get me like a reservation
[7768.50s -> 7780.38s]  downstairs? Easy. Oh, we had one final bit coming from Mitchell, thanks to five dollars.
[7781.18s -> 7786.06s]  Hey, Yerma, thanks for the awesome stream tonight. Five guys being below Taco Bell is a crime against
[7786.06s -> 7791.10s]  humanity, but uh, whatever. I waited 20 minutes into the 30 minute slow-mo to ask you to play
[7791.10s -> 7796.78s]  Freedom Force 1 and 2, but the message still managed to immediately disappear. I think you'd
[7796.78s -> 7803.18s]  love them. I think I have Freedom Force. Didn't I play Freedom Force? Well, that was Freedom Fighters.
[7804.22s -> 7817.16s]  Freedom Force. What's the final tally? I don't know. I- I- the bot got uh, eaten alive.
[7821.94s -> 7830.86s]  Truly a minus one thousand stream. What did I do today? We did episode one of
[7830.86s -> 7837.98s]  season three of Sam and Max, and then I spent way too long deliberating over a fast food tier list.
[7844.10s -> 7849.59s]  But uh, thank you everybody for watching. See you tomorrow. The plan is Star and I are going to do
[7849.59s -> 7853.43s]  something. I don't know. We'll see. Plans change, but that's what's supposed to happen.
[7854.63s -> 7860.06s]  See you tomorrow at the normal time somewhere around three to four p.m. Pacific. See you tomorrow.
[7861.10s -> 7890.97s]  Have a great one.
