[0.70s -> 11.14s]  Comedy Central TV time. Aye yi yi. God damn it. You guys have no idea. I'll wait a little bit for
[11.14s -> 17.45s]  people to come in for me to tell this story. Because to understand the end of the story,
[17.45s -> 25.03s]  you have to understand the beginning. What is Guitar-O-Man? Oh, you're in for a treat,
[25.03s -> 32.33s]  and so am I. Because I ain't ever played it either. And this is the original Guitar-O-Man.
[35.98s -> 45.83s]  That's supposed to be the title. The original Guitar-O-Man. This ain't no hacked copy.
[46.63s -> 51.35s]  This ain't the remake that was on PlayStation Portable. This is the original Guitar-O-Man for
[51.35s -> 63.48s]  PlayStation 2. Am I gonna do a stream on Rhythm Heaven? Maybe. But I wanted to break it up a
[63.48s -> 70.36s]  little bit today. We've been doing horror games. Scary scream-in-your-face games. For the last like
[70.36s -> 77.98s]  two weeks. So I'm like, you know, it's time to break it up and do something a little more
[77.98s -> 89.50s]  light-hearted. So today, we are gonna do Guitar-O-Man. And then tomorrow, we're going to do
[90.46s -> 100.94s]  the new Trine with Star and Ashley. I believe that's what's happening tomorrow. So we're gonna
[100.94s -> 107.98s]  light it up a little bit. And then after that, we're gonna go to the thing. We've got a whole
[107.98s -> 124.09s]  plan for this next week or two straight. Yes, the thing. What thing? The thing. The thing.
[124.73s -> 133.80s]  But anyways, let's have a little discussion on what happened earlier today. The Three Triners.
[133.80s -> 138.84s]  That's right. Okay, so like I said, to understand the end of the story, you have to understand the
[138.84s -> 146.86s]  beginning. So as a lot of you know, I've been having some issues lately. Stomach issues.
[147.50s -> 151.74s]  I've been having stomach pain. I've been having abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, and back pain
[151.74s -> 157.98s]  for the last probably eight months. I've had a colonoscopy. We've gone through like all kinds
[157.98s -> 163.10s]  of stuff. We've gone, I've had a colonoscopy. I'm going in for like another endoscopy of my
[163.10s -> 168.22s]  stomach. I have to get a liver scan. We're trying to find out what the fuck is wrong with me, right?
[168.22s -> 172.54s]  Because it's, I don't, we don't think it's related to colitis. Whatever it is, we're trying to figure
[172.54s -> 178.22s]  it out. So I'm on a couple of new medications, right? And these medications, let's just lay it
[178.22s -> 184.94s]  out there because you have to understand. Let's lay it out there. I don't care. I right now,
[184.94s -> 190.14s]  which we're trying to do a few things, and one of them is to do with my intestines and my stomach.
[190.14s -> 197.99s]  Right now, I am on a prescription grade laxative. Let's get it out there. Like out of what the fuck
[197.99s -> 205.72s]  do I care? One of the reasons why I've had to say, wait, our streams are going to be like
[205.72s -> 211.80s]  four or five hours, four hours this week is because I'm actually on a literal prescription
[211.80s -> 219.61s]  grade laxative. So that's one of the, that's one of the medications I'm on. We're trying something
[219.61s -> 228.09s]  to do. It's, I don't even, I don't even tell you why I just am. Anyways, so I know I'm on all this
[228.09s -> 234.81s]  new medication and I know that I have a liver scan coming up. So I have a liver scan coming up
[234.81s -> 242.90s]  in a couple of weeks actually. And I woke up this morning. Seemed like a pretty normal morning,
[242.90s -> 247.80s]  right? Yeah, everything's normal. What's, what's, what's going on here? Just going to get my coffee
[247.80s -> 251.64s]  and have some fun and just stream. That sounds like, yeah, we're going to stream today too.
[252.44s -> 259.08s]  So those of you that know anything about liver problems, there is a certain condition that can
[259.08s -> 266.60s]  come that can arise when you have a pretty, a liver issue. One of those things is yellowing
[266.60s -> 272.94s]  of the skin. It's called jaundice. So I woke up this morning and I didn't look in the mirror.
[272.94s -> 278.38s]  I hadn't taken like a shower yet. I was making coffee. It was up and down the stairs. So about
[278.38s -> 283.34s]  like an hour and a half or so before I was going to start the stream, I look in the mirror and I
[283.34s -> 292.92s]  noticed that my skin is yellow, like under my arms was bright Crayola yellow. And I'm going,
[293.72s -> 301.06s]  no, this is, that's, that's jaundice, right? I'm on this new medication. Is it the new medicine?
[301.06s -> 307.78s]  Oh, okay. I'm, I got to figure this out. What the fuck is happening? So I called Kim and I'm like,
[307.78s -> 312.58s]  Kim, I just want to let you know, I'm probably, I got to go to the doctor. I'm not sure if this
[312.58s -> 315.70s]  is something to do maybe with the liver thing that we were talking about, me and the doctor.
[316.34s -> 320.74s]  So I, I, I got to go get like something done. I got to get my blood work or something.
[321.78s -> 325.94s]  Okay. So that's what's going to happen. Just want to make sure I'm okay. Everything's fine.
[325.94s -> 334.07s]  And I'm about to literally go to the, to the ER. Like I was going to go to the ER because the
[334.07s -> 337.11s]  doctor's office, all the doctor's office is closed on the weekends. By the way, why the fuck is that
[337.11s -> 345.88s]  a thing? Why are doctor's offices closed on the weekend? What if you have a problem? But anyways,
[345.88s -> 356.44s]  so I'm like getting re ready to go with my, my yellow skin and I stopped for a second and I,
[357.08s -> 372.62s]  I take a wet wipe and I start to wipe hard on the places that are yellow and it's coming off.
[372.62s -> 383.27s]  My skin was dyed yellow from a bath I took yesterday. I took a bath last night and,
[384.98s -> 394.87s]  and put in some like a, like, like an oil essential oil thing and it was green. It's
[394.87s -> 409.34s]  from a bath bomb. It was turmeric oil, but you have to understand something. I've been told
[409.34s -> 414.10s]  we need to check your liver. Um, your abdominal pain could be because you, you might have an,
[414.10s -> 420.66s]  you know, you might have an enlarged liver and liver jaundice and my brain, I'm just going,
[420.66s -> 430.30s]  this is the, this is the, this has to be it. So I dyed my skin yellow accidentally last night,
[430.30s -> 439.05s]  taken a bath bomb bath and I, but it wasn't there. It was not, it was not there.
[440.49s -> 447.37s]  I didn't get out of the bath and I wasn't like yellow. I woke up yellow. I didn't go to bed
[447.37s -> 460.30s]  yellow. Oh, but I, I, I, I, can you imagine if I had gone to the doctor? Yes. What is it? Mr.
[460.30s -> 465.50s]  Hamilton? You've got, unless I see you've got some jaundice there. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. And I
[465.50s -> 469.26s]  would give him the whole story. Yeah. We're trying to figure it out. I mean, my regular doctor,
[469.26s -> 474.06s]  we're trying to figure out like I'm getting a liver exam, a liver, a scan. We think my liver
[474.06s -> 479.10s]  might be have some problems with it. Um, I've been having abdominal pain and this is all real.
[479.82s -> 482.46s]  And he's like, Oh, come here for a second. Let me take a look at you. Yeah. Let's go,
[482.46s -> 489.94s]  let's put you through a bunch of more tests. And he finds out that I've just like have like
[490.82s -> 494.63s]  yellow food coloring on me. What is that doctor going to say to me?
[496.44s -> 504.34s]  He's medical grade wet wipes. He's going to be like, uh, Jeremy, did you, are you, uh,
[505.06s -> 511.72s]  did you, did you do this? Why are you have yellow food coloring on you coming to the doctor?
[511.72s -> 516.73s]  Cause if I didn't do that, it would be just as much of a surprise to me as it is to him
[516.73s -> 524.07s]  or them, whatever. Right. It'd be like, I don't know. I don't know what that is. Is that what's
[524.07s -> 532.42s]  going on? I'm confused too. Did, uh, did somebody paint me? Somebody paint my body? I don't know.
[532.42s -> 541.98s]  Doctor, I don't know what's going on. Imagine having to have that conversation of like, this
[541.98s -> 549.85s]  is you have that's okay. You know, when GameStop employees, uh, tell you about the crazy customer
[549.85s -> 556.65s]  that comes in and like, Oh, it's a GameStop stories dot Reddit, whatever. Right. I would be on the
[556.73s -> 562.39s]  like doctor, like crazy stories subreddit. So I have the guy that came in with, with like the
[562.39s -> 575.72s]  yellow paint on his body telling the doctor he had jaundiced. God damn it. So that was my, uh,
[577.08s -> 584.34s]  that was my afternoon. I canceled the stream. I came in here before the stream started and I
[584.34s -> 589.14s]  canceled it. I was like, guys, I've, I've got like an issue I've got to figure out.
[597.06s -> 601.75s]  But the reason why this sucks so bad is, and I know that's like funny,
[602.63s -> 607.90s]  but like at the same time I'm sitting there going, all right, so we still got to figure out what's
[607.90s -> 616.04s]  wrong with me. I still have to go for those exams. You know what I mean? I still am on a prescription
[616.04s -> 627.16s]  grade laxative. You know, that doesn't go away. But anyways, uh, so today we're going to play
[627.16s -> 641.90s]  guitar. Oh man, that's, that was the story. He's fooling his chat live. Like I can't imagine
[641.90s -> 645.10s]  how embarrassing that would be if I, if I actually went to the doctor,
[646.14s -> 650.86s]  he would just take a wet, like a, like a medical grade wet wipe and just go like that and be like,
[650.86s -> 658.34s]  sir, what are you doing here? Like the cost, it would cost so much like money too.
[658.98s -> 663.22s]  Imagine you go to the ER and it's just, you have to wipe your skin with a wet wipe.
[664.10s -> 672.90s]  Oh man. Anyways, we can move on now. I just figured I would let you guys know.
[673.78s -> 680.10s]  That's why the stream is starting 40 minutes late. Uh, we had some huge, uh, donations coming here.
[680.10s -> 689.30s]  We had Freddy dread gave 10,000 bits, $100, 10,000 bits. Uh, Frig, I can't watch the stream today,
[689.30s -> 699.10s]  but game hard boss. Oh, this is a hard game. Okay. Thank you for the 10,000 bits. Freddy
[699.10s -> 707.32s]  dread. I'll do my best. It's going to be a relaxing stream. It's all right. And then another thing
[707.32s -> 713.72s]  I've like come to, like, I've come to terms with the fact that shit like that just kind of happens
[714.36s -> 724.33s]  to me. You know, it's just like, and whatever, it's just another one. He's telling you the
[724.33s -> 737.61s]  game's hard and it's all right. What's this? Somebody's got an image. That's not even what
[737.61s -> 747.40s]  I said. What it's got an amazing man. I misread it. They say, no, it says, uh, Frig, I can't watch
[747.40s -> 757.34s]  the stream today, but game hard boss, like game hard, like game sucks. And they're calling me boss.
[760.58s -> 764.74s]  Is this like a game hard? This game is hard or go for it. You game hard today.
[765.38s -> 773.40s]  I don't know. I woke up yellow today. Okay. I'm still getting over this. It was like very
[773.40s -> 779.34s]  stressful. I was like, I was like, we're going to call my mother and shit. Like it was, this was
[779.34s -> 788.66s]  daughter, like a very good morning. That's a sentence. Oh, okay. But anyways, thank you,
[788.66s -> 794.10s]  Freddy dread. And then thank you to, uh, zip. So for the 10 community subs, appreciate that. Thank
[794.10s -> 804.01s]  you. Uh, I cannot do face cam today because, um, it's not plugged in. That's it. I've been
[804.01s -> 807.61s]  doing a lot of face cam. We're going to, this is, this is, we don't need face cam. This is a,
[807.61s -> 812.90s]  this is a music stream. Speaking of music streams. Why don't we take a look at it?
[813.62s -> 823.93s]  And here it is, or at least it should be there. It's our old man. Hey, yeah. I don't even know
[823.93s -> 831.77s]  what it sounds like. What does it sound like? Why can I not hear this? Did it just stop?
[839.54s -> 846.54s]  All right. First things first, like we do with every old console game, we need to test to make
[846.54s -> 854.01s]  sure that you can, that this is synced up. Okay. Here we go. You ready? One, two, three, four,
[854.01s -> 864.90s]  one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. We good. All right. So, uh, guitar,
[864.90s -> 869.14s]  old man is a game where you play the guitar and it's a rhythm game. And apparently it's a hard
[869.14s -> 875.35s]  game. What I've been told from, uh, some of the members of this community, let's give it a try.
[875.35s -> 880.23s]  We got a full motion video cut scene in the beginning. That's good.
[888.95s -> 891.11s]  Hmm. It's Snoopy.
[894.15s -> 898.47s]  You know, you want, cause he been pecking on you again. You're really like totally useless.
[898.47s -> 904.55s]  Aren't you? Oh, shut up. But you want, there's something you can do about it. I think.
[905.19s -> 913.45s]  Come on, let's go. Give it a shot. Oh, it's going to teach me how to play the guitar on a tennis
[913.45s -> 925.54s]  racket. Me when I'm on prescription grade laxatives. All right. I tell you, I, I, I'm,
[925.54s -> 932.84s]  I'm all right. I'll be completely transparent with it. All right. Guitar.
[936.14s -> 949.19s]  There's one, two. I don't have one. Head forward. Head. Yeah. Like give yourself a nerd neck.
[949.51s -> 955.50s]  How's that? Feel good. Okay. Lean forward. Same thing with the left stick.
[955.50s -> 962.28s]  Tilt it in any direction and spin around and tilt your head forward. Relax your shoulders.
[967.22s -> 983.56s]  Have bad airflow. It's called the trace line. Okay. Wait, I just have to use the analog.
[985.21s -> 994.28s]  Look, rotate the left analog to follow the trace. Oh shit. Oh man. This isn't going to be hard.
[994.84s -> 1005.59s]  This is a hard game boss. When do I get to go like,
[1017.19s -> 1044.02s]  so you hold it and let it go. Oh Jesus. Okay. I'm ready. I'll try. Oh, this way. Oh shit.
[1053.50s -> 1069.50s]  Come on. That's better than okay. Wait, that wasn't me doing that. I thought that was me doing that.
[1080.66s -> 1083.30s]  Nice. It's Cheeto.
[1089.72s -> 1095.48s]  I just spilled coffee literally all over my whole body. Give me a break. What a disaster.
[1096.12s -> 1098.12s]  So how do you use a guitar to fight?
[1104.92s -> 1109.64s]  First, the charge. The charge is the phase where you gain power. I have like a street fighter meter.
[1111.40s -> 1115.00s]  If your timing's off or if the trace line goes out of the blue zone, you won't gain.
[1119.48s -> 1124.84s]  Next, the battle phase. There's the attack mode in the car. You alternate between them.
[1124.92s -> 1126.92s]  What?
[1131.40s -> 1136.12s]  Okay. Oh no.
[1139.88s -> 1145.93s]  Thank God this is on PlayStation controller.
[1156.79s -> 1172.89s]  Here we go. I don't need him to say push.
[1182.86s -> 1197.66s]  I mean, you're adorable, but I don't need you to say it. I don't like how they're not colored
[1197.66s -> 1204.07s]  correctly. Oh, I guess they are. What am I talking about? Red is uh, or yeah, pink is square.
[1209.43s -> 1210.39s]  I'll be all right.
[1217.66s -> 1219.82s]  So wait, do I get to like just strum random stuff?
[1219.82s -> 1228.26s]  Okay, so don't make mistakes. Easy.
[1238.39s -> 1243.59s]  Yeah, I just won't make any mistakes. Tutorial boss incoming.
[1246.57s -> 1292.41s]  Good. Don't make any mistakes. What? Here we go. Defense. It's just about timing. It's just
[1292.41s -> 1321.08s]  right when the beat happens. I'll be really good. Now it's my turn. Oh shit. What did I do?
[1322.44s -> 1340.70s]  Oh, that's fucking hard when you go around in a circle. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?
[1340.70s -> 1351.14s]  Why are these stuff? I'm big. This is too much. I can't do this.
[1361.00s -> 1366.92s]  Dude, you know it's getting real when their mouth turns into a square. That's how you know
[1366.92s -> 1390.46s]  shit's hitting the fucking fan. This is real. This is an issue. This is a little issue that I
[1390.46s -> 1396.38s]  have here. I have an old, I have a, hold on, somebody's coming in the room. Could you just
[1396.38s -> 1401.26s]  open this jar real quick? Sorry. I'm getting like, I'm getting like jump scared from behind.
[1401.82s -> 1416.17s]  Open this jar? How come every time? This is just what I do. Look at that. Thank you. I still got
[1416.17s -> 1429.26s]  it. Thank you. I still got it. I just opened jars on stream. Sorry about that. The last, okay. I
[1429.26s -> 1436.81s]  think the last three Kim appearances on stream have been open the jar. Here comes the dog.
[1437.77s -> 1451.82s]  Open the jar. I'm fairly certain about that. All right. Here we go. Retry. No, try again. I lost
[1451.82s -> 1463.51s]  already? All right. I'm ready. Why do you get full power? What I'm going to say is I have a,
[1464.15s -> 1471.37s]  I don't have an official PlayStation 2 controller. I can already, I can see an issue here already.
[1472.41s -> 1522.04s]  Okay. Excuse me. Let's go. It's very jagged. Yeah. I got it. I got it. I got that right. What
[1522.04s -> 1562.63s]  happened? Why do I feel like I'm doing that wrong? Get out of here. Oops. This is actually
[1562.63s -> 1593.27s]  really fun. I'll tell you one thing though. This takes every single ounce of my concentration.
[1594.07s -> 1610.07s]  I don't have room in my brain to speak. Not today. It's taking up every spot in my mind.
[1610.07s -> 1675.35s]  The final, here we go. Oh, got it. What? No. You win. Who's the dinosaur?
[1676.95s -> 1690.97s]  The game is way too fast. I got a B. I'll take a B. How many misses? Only 4%.
[1691.85s -> 1701.37s]  I got mostly good. That's a B. I'll take a B. Replay this game. What? What are you talking
[1701.37s -> 1712.89s]  about? Replay this game. Collection get. Save current game. Yes. Put it in slot one.
[1713.53s -> 1751.69s]  Which bank will you save game data in? Toothbrush lizard? All right. Sounds good. What? Wouldn't
[1751.69s -> 1764.39s]  you be more injured? I feel like first try I could do a better job dubbing that. I mean,
[1764.39s -> 1767.19s]  maybe not like the quality of the voice, but like the quality of the singing.
[1790.76s -> 1796.49s]  My dog can talk. That's a real quick way to get everyone to pay attention.
[1800.07s -> 1803.35s]  No, but then it's like every television show that's ever had a talking animal in it.
[1805.72s -> 1810.60s]  They'll come over and the dog won't talk. It'll just like pee on a hydrant or something. It won't
[1810.60s -> 1825.61s]  speak. What the fuck is this? Remember the Warner Brothers frog? The guy that found the frog.
[1825.61s -> 1829.53s]  They're hello my baby. Hello my dog. And nobody did. He didn't do it in front of anybody else.
[1829.53s -> 1844.33s]  And the guy went nuts as a boomer reference. That's a classic piece of animation history.
[1847.90s -> 1862.70s]  Flying. Oh, you're stopping the UFO invasion. This sounds pretty good. I got to get both
[1862.70s -> 1904.04s]  headphones into this one. Nice. Pretty good. 100% this one. What do you say?
[1915.13s -> 1928.76s]  That was hard. It was hard. That was hard. What do you mean killing? I'm not killing anybody.
[1929.16s -> 1967.53s]  I'm still winning. Slot machine. I love it. Damn it. This controller sucks. What brand is this?
[1967.53s -> 1971.21s]  It's unbranded. That's the problem. I have an unbranded controller right now.
[1971.93s -> 1988.22s]  That's bad. It's not even a mad cat. I'm still winning. All right. You're going to pay attention.
[1988.78s -> 2024.12s]  Fuck. Come on. I was doing it. I haven't taken very much damage. That's all right. Okay. Be ready.
[2024.92s -> 2046.65s]  Oh, come on. This thing's unbranded. It's unbranded. It has a turbo, though.
[2047.45s -> 2057.06s]  Watch out, little lady.
[2094.06s -> 2096.30s]  I fucked up. Not the last note.
[2100.68s -> 2111.08s]  That's the last note again. You absolutely fucked the ending.
[2111.80s -> 2113.00s]  You win.
[2116.41s -> 2133.50s]  I still did okay. Me. I'll take it. Why do I not have an official PS2 controller? What was I
[2133.50s -> 2143.18s]  thinking? I mean, yes. This is a purchase from like three years ago. Go get one. I don't need one.
[2143.18s -> 2161.54s]  I'll deal with it. It's an excuse. Can you imagine? Okay. So I don't want to leave right now. Like,
[2161.54s -> 2168.82s]  no, I can't. I don't want to leave. I just started the stream. Imagine like Uber Eatsing,
[2168.82s -> 2178.34s]  a PlayStation 2 controller, like Postmatesing, an Uber Eats controller. You can't buy these guys.
[2179.14s -> 2185.26s]  There's no buying these. A PlayStation 2 controller, you can't buy them anywhere. You
[2185.26s -> 2197.83s]  have to like special get them on like Amazon. Do Amazon same day prime. Yeah. It'll be here in
[2197.83s -> 2216.65s]  like 12 hours. Same day delivery. Yeah, it's three o'clock Pacific. Okay, let's go. Get out,
[2216.65s -> 2229.64s]  get out, get out, get out, get out. No, don't. I already did it, didn't I? Yes. No.
[2235.50s -> 2237.26s]  Get Amazon ultra delivery.
[2249.26s -> 2252.86s]  Do not fail me. Send Moto King B into the forest.
[2256.95s -> 2261.91s]  Okay, listen, you one, you're of the guitar man bloodline, inheritor of the legendary guitar.
[2261.91s -> 2265.75s]  Of course. If you can collect all the guitars, you'll gain great powers and boom,
[2265.75s -> 2270.47s]  huh? I have other plans. I'm going to practice my skateboarding and Pico's going to be like,
[2270.47s -> 2278.87s]  wow, you're so cool. Look, only you can use this guitar that's been passed down for generations
[2278.87s -> 2284.15s]  by the ancestors. The ancestors, meaning my ancestors, meaning what? By the way, Puma,
[2284.15s -> 2288.15s]  since when exactly have you been living at my place? I don't know exactly when I was born,
[2288.15s -> 2294.79s]  so I'm not exactly the, look out. Are you sure that that dog's okay? It's got like a crushed head.
[2295.59s -> 2329.56s]  All right, here we go. I didn't even see the intro here. Frog King B.
[2338.36s -> 2372.39s]  Let's do it. All right. That was definitely the best song so far.
[2399.69s -> 2415.24s]  Yeah, that's all the commentary you're going to get. That's the only thing I'm going to say
[2415.24s -> 2426.20s]  this whole stream. I guarantee it. Yeah. Yeah. Just cap that and just play it over and over again.
[2426.20s -> 2456.44s]  I'm not doing that bad this one. I'm not. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[2487.93s -> 2493.08s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what to say.
[2493.08s -> 2494.92s]  I had to get, I got to come up with my bread and butter.
[2495.64s -> 2535.70s]  Holy shit. I have the whole thing screwed up. Okay. Did I win? It's pretty, it's pretty close.
[2535.70s -> 2618.90s]  Come on. Get rid of them. Yes. Here comes the finale. Oh my God. Kim Post makes me a
[2618.90s -> 2642.15s]  PlayStation 2 controller. What? What do you mean try again? No. What? I can't press start? Hold on.
[2642.15s -> 2653.78s]  If I pause the game, that's, that's immediate retry. Oh, and what? Oh, that's not good.
[2655.50s -> 2664.71s]  There's no breaks. You actually can't. I guess I understand because it's cheating.
[2664.71s -> 2702.65s]  There was like 30 seconds left in this song. Hold on a second. Here we go. It's the PS2 version of
[2702.65s -> 2713.50s]  this game, not the controller. The controls are poopy. What's wrong? Why do I have to have help?
[2714.39s -> 2722.06s]  All right. I'm going to, this is the one. Here we go. Can you pause real quick? I need to pee.
[2722.06s -> 2731.19s]  No, we're going to turn it up. That's what we're going to do. You got pee? Oh, that's too bad.
[2732.81s -> 2736.25s]  And you know what? I'm fine. This is, I, I like the song. The song is good. Here we go.
[2737.21s -> 2770.34s]  It's all right. Fucked up is going on here. Did this shit get harder because I retried it?
[2770.90s -> 2805.51s]  Never been as hard. Going from down to up or left to right is like,
[2807.83s -> 2823.90s]  shit didn't happen the last time I did this. Look, look, I'm not doing anything.
[2824.70s -> 2849.90s]  I'm not doing, I wasn't doing anything. I was holding it in the same spot. That's just DDR.
[2854.07s -> 2865.96s]  I never even played DDR in my entire life. I've never played DDR. I'm serious. Not one time.
[2866.68s -> 2896.76s]  DDR was the only exercise I ever got. No, that's what I had Wii Sports for.
[2918.14s -> 2954.39s]  Banging on the door? Getting close. All right. Finale. This is it. Pause games. I'm not pausing.
[2954.39s -> 2985.59s]  I can't. Come on. It's too, you don't get it. Look at the change. Look at the change. You saw it.
[2985.59s -> 3010.25s]  Let's see. I didn't fuck that up. All right. So if I look, look, see what happened. So I'm moving
[3010.25s -> 3016.33s]  from like, I'm moving one degree. Sometimes you move one degree and it goes to like four o'clock.
[3017.29s -> 3025.21s]  If you start at 12 and you want to move it to one, it will go to like four o'clock sometimes.
[3025.21s -> 3051.43s]  I'm telling you. Hold on a second. It's not possible. You can't, you can't,
[3052.07s -> 3068.97s]  I can't get a PS2 controller right now. I've exercised those options. Okay. Looks good.
[3081.29s -> 3086.65s]  It's Miranda the elder. Quite impressive. Defeating such a powerful gravillian agent.
[3086.65s -> 3090.97s]  Gravillian? Oh, we've prayed and waited for this moment.
[3102.01s -> 3105.69s]  It's one of Stewie's grand, like, steam costumes.
[3106.01s -> 3127.34s]  He just wants to learn how to skateboard.
[3128.06s -> 3136.97s]  Everything in life is the consequence of your own acts. Master the waves.
[3144.20s -> 3149.61s]  All right. Here we are. Two moons.
[3149.61s -> 3180.92s]  It's a hammerhead shark that plays music.
[3183.77s -> 3202.62s]  Here we go. It's a weird beat. It's a little bit of a weird beat.
[3203.18s -> 3221.99s]  It's hard to keep up with because it's off beats. Not that hard. It was. I'm not going to diminish
[3221.99s -> 3248.31s]  the fact that it was very hard. Oh shit. Oh, I gotta pause the game. I gotta pause it.
[3276.30s -> 3293.53s]  Oh my God. When can I fight him? Can I do damage? Is that just phase one? That's probably phase one.
[3294.09s -> 3301.27s]  You made it. No, that's it. I did it. All right. That was pretty tricky.
[3301.99s -> 3314.87s]  The issue was the do-do-do. So it goes do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[3314.87s -> 3336.06s]  And you have to press the do-do-do. It can get tricky. Overwrite it. Save it.
[3341.14s -> 3363.56s]  Okay. Is this first playthrough? Yes. I have never played this game before.
[3363.56s -> 3367.08s]  Oh, would you look at that? Now he's a giant robot. What do we do, robot?
[3369.96s -> 3379.45s]  He transformed it into a deep turntable? All right. That's pretty crazy. That's pretty crazy.
[3379.45s -> 3407.30s]  The music for this level sucks. Does it? No. It's a good start.
[3413.11s -> 3434.92s]  Damn. I love it. All right. Let's do it. Mech battle. Follow me.
[3449.78s -> 3457.72s]  These fucking controls, man. Give me a break. Like, look at that. How am I...
[3465.99s -> 3501.69s]  No, there's no way. What the fuck did I do wrong here? No, no, no. Look at... It's not...
[3501.69s -> 3512.04s]  Do you see what happens here? No way. Uh-uh. It's not me. Look. It's not me. Look what happens.
[3512.04s -> 3569.50s]  Look at this. Oh, why? No, stop. I have to tilt my neck. My god. I don't know if I'm going to be
[3569.50s -> 3589.74s]  able to do this. Oh, my god, guys. I can't postmate the controller. Kim already looked.
[3590.78s -> 3614.31s]  Sorry. I can still win. Don't push the stick. So, when you see it spaz out, that is probably
[3614.31s -> 3634.34s]  one degree change. I can still win.
[3637.80s -> 3640.92s]  That might become a real problem later on, though.
[3662.25s -> 3673.46s]  What the fuck? I'm not touching anything. I've heard better reggae. Well, it doesn't help that
[3673.46s -> 3698.33s]  half of the song is not being played. I'm still going to win. I mean, my defense is just absolutely
[3698.33s -> 3704.89s]  impenetrable.
[3719.77s -> 3724.38s]  No! No!
[3735.58s -> 3737.42s]  I almost paused the game for that one.
[3738.30s -> 3754.09s]  I actually did it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. No!
[3777.70s -> 3788.73s]  Anytime there's a change of direction is where it becomes, like, impossible.
[3801.46s -> 3802.50s]  Finale incoming.
[3810.54s -> 3817.18s]  Okay. No, that's it. That was the finale. Use the d-pad? I don't think you can.
[3819.45s -> 3823.05s]  This one's probably going to be a C. I can't guarantee a B for this one. Yes, I can.
[3831.82s -> 3833.98s]  Save, please. Save, please. What am I doing wrong?
[3838.02s -> 3848.28s]  Save. Previously saved game data exists. Overwrite saved data. Yes. Hold on a second.
[3851.38s -> 3862.65s]  Wouldn't the highlighted one be the one that's... Okay.
[3862.65s -> 3868.34s]  Huh? What's that? We got it.
[3896.65s -> 3899.61s]  It's just Rick and Morty voice acting.
[3911.37s -> 3914.97s]  Yeah, that's the demeanor that Justin Roiland does for every character that's
[3914.97s -> 3917.21s]  a character that you're not supposed to care about.
[3918.25s -> 3923.83s]  Hey, it's me, this character. The one that talks like this. I'm doing this. I'm in the bathtub.
[3923.91s -> 3925.99s]  It's me. Bathtub. I'm the bathtub guy.
[3944.18s -> 3947.22s]  I didn't know. Okay. I thought I had Jaundice.
[3950.38s -> 3952.78s]  Like I said, there's a whole... All right. I'm not going to talk over Cousin.
[3967.06s -> 3970.50s]  I just came out for a walk to see the moon, but then I heard that.
[3971.14s -> 3974.58s]  Oh, this. Yeah. Somehow I seem to be okay with this thing.
[3975.30s -> 3978.66s]  You're good. I tried once, but I could never play like that.
[3987.83s -> 3999.61s]  Is there a reason why every like anime young boy character is an old lady straining their voice?
[4000.82s -> 4016.20s]  That's... Isn't that strange? It's weird, right? Wait, this is like a... Hold on.
[4017.08s -> 4029.11s]  I wrote this song for you. No, hold on. I've been practicing.
[4033.45s -> 4048.14s]  Don't get up. Don't get up. Hold on. Oh, no. Sorry. I have to go home now.
[4060.73s -> 4063.53s]  That's fucking funny. All right. Let's do it for real.
[4063.53s -> 4076.25s]  I wrote this kid's day. Let's see what happens after a few weeks of practice.
[4076.25s -> 4082.22s]  Actually, probably like more like eight years of practice. 10,000 hours of practice.
[4090.02s -> 4100.12s]  He's going to play Wonderwall. No, he's not.
[4115.66s -> 4122.23s]  She looks over like, okay, come on. Come on. You fucked that one up.
[4125.37s -> 4136.49s]  Why does she have a life bar? Why am I like killing her? I guess
[4137.21s -> 4144.31s]  I kind of would be like in this situation, right? I just gotta listen to this.
[4157.26s -> 4197.90s]  All right. He's got half the notes. Okay. Nice job. That's the abrupt changes. I'm trying.
[4213.08s -> 4229.72s]  Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh, please. It's almost over. I did it. Oh, yeah.
[4238.01s -> 4258.52s]  I got another V. That's too generous. No, it's not. It's fine. Just in case everyone's curious,
[4258.52s -> 4264.20s]  I have to press the down button on the D-pad. That's not left. It's not right. It's down on the
[4264.20s -> 4273.93s]  D-pad. I'm sorry. And it was fucking completely silent too. The singer's voice was honey love.
[4273.93s -> 4290.55s]  What? Where's Puma? Puma. Puma. Where'd you go? Why'd you leave me? What am I going to do about
[4290.63s -> 4306.04s]  myself? No, not again. That's expensive. I have you now, Gitaru man. Puma, what's happened? Where
[4306.04s -> 4310.12s]  could you have gone? I want those shoes. So lonely, Puma. Those things are awesome. We've been together
[4310.12s -> 4318.36s]  so long. That's why I said I didn't want to come to this stupid place. What? It's moving.
[4322.44s -> 4326.12s]  I probably can get those at a mall kiosk. You know, like the big goofy
[4326.20s -> 4334.68s]  sneaker slippers. Welcome to our planet, Gitaru man. Hey, it's you. How does it feel to know
[4334.68s -> 4341.56s]  you've been had? Zoe, I'm going to. By the way, your friend has been waiting for you.
[4341.56s -> 4349.70s]  Don't say it. I know what they look like. So you dognapped him. It was too easy. You're both
[4350.18s -> 4356.98s]  so cute. Gitaru man, without this mutt, you can't fight. You creep, give Puma back to me. Go son
[4356.98s -> 4363.98s]  Montreal. This is going to be fun. All right. Is this, how's this one? Anybody know the songs?
[4363.98s -> 4373.43s]  Is this one good? All of a sudden it's like, I'd be like, holy shit. It's, it's the bone song.
[4373.99s -> 4412.18s]  Holy shit. Bone song. I don't have a guitar. Let's go. This is the best song.
[4412.74s -> 4463.03s]  Come on, you're the guitar. Get it. Here we go.
[4504.50s -> 4549.19s]  I didn't even see this mobile combat theme. Oh shit. Oh my God.
[4590.79s -> 4597.96s]  Thank God somebody has a trumpet behind me.
[4621.62s -> 4624.95s]  Holy shit. Hard game boss.
[4632.02s -> 4633.54s]  From here to here is an issue.
[4638.95s -> 4640.39s]  And then from here to here is an issue.
[4640.79s -> 4643.40s]  God damn it. You win.
[4650.42s -> 4687.16s]  B. Not a C. Come on. Let's go. I'm going to get it. I have to get a B. Come on. It's all about
[4687.16s -> 4773.67s]  defense. That was just doing it on. Why's it not telling me how I did? Gitaru! What the fuck is
[4773.67s -> 4787.90s]  going on right now? What? Was that just, that was, that's a replay. Like a replay of the,
[4787.90s -> 4807.75s]  like it records the game. What? Replay this game? Like replay the left, like redo it, like do it.
[4807.75s -> 4814.07s]  This is like 2000, this is like 1999 or something. It records your game for you.
[4820.47s -> 4827.10s]  That would be retry. I don't know. It's a Japanese game, isn't it? Like replay this game.
[4827.74s -> 4842.18s]  I don't know. I thought it was like redo it, like do it again. I don't know that the game
[4842.18s -> 4871.06s]  records everything you do. And by the way, manga S. Damn it. What the fuck? I just want to retry
[4871.06s -> 4880.25s]  the level. Replay this level. You're all so grateful. Grateful to me? Gosh, we have been
[4880.25s -> 4885.37s]  freed. But the real battle is just beginning. To save this planet, you must get back all
[4885.37s -> 4890.57s]  the Gitarus the enemy has taken. There are just two left. When they're all collected,
[4890.57s -> 4895.29s]  a great power will shake the sky. You can't allow Zoe to possess that power.
[4896.81s -> 4905.27s]  Gitaruman, go now! Let's do it. We gotta go, you one. We gotta get out of here.
[4905.27s -> 4921.14s]  Don't lose now. Okay, here we go. Just two more. That's it? I'm about to beat this fucking game.
[4929.59s -> 4944.79s]  Gregorio. That's either the third or that is a scroll. Like a magic scroll. Or it's a
[4945.75s -> 4949.75s]  like a sand time thing that you turn upside down. This just sounds pretty good.
[4973.51s -> 4997.38s]  Replay it. But these last two might be very hard. Maybe can I turn like sensitivity down? Definitely
[4997.38s -> 5014.34s]  not. It's so small. It's such a tiny increase. It's stuck. There's no fucking
[5014.34s -> 5066.58s]  way you can do this. Possible, I don't think. I'm trying so hard right now. Got it.
[5077.29s -> 5107.45s]  Winning. Here comes the defense. What did you do that? Sorry, I had to do that.
[5145.53s -> 5152.28s]  Why did somebody just say omega lol? For what reason? For what reason did you say that?
[5178.46s -> 5211.90s]  Oh, I'm gonna win. Oh my god, it's so hard. I'm doing it wrong. I don't know what I'm
[5211.90s -> 5237.99s]  doing wrong. It's okay. Come on. Come on. Kill him. Please. I don't want to do it again. Oh no.
[5248.07s -> 5260.94s]  No! What? You lose. Mama, I've done it again. It's so hard to control. It's so hard.
[5262.06s -> 5270.65s]  This is the analog. Please. I'm telling you. Don't think I'm bad. It's not me. It's not me.
[5272.41s -> 5278.07s]  Don't think that I'm not good. It's not me. This isn't me. It's not me.
[5285.42s -> 5287.83s]  All right. Focus.
[5301.11s -> 5335.91s]  It was the controller. All right. Come on. I didn't do anything.
[5346.74s -> 5366.70s]  All right. Let's go. It just ripped to the side. Come on. Good.
[5376.55s -> 5380.44s]  All right. Get ready. I fucked it up last time. Bad. Not this time.
[5387.48s -> 5389.56s]  What happened there? What was the problem?
[5390.04s -> 5449.94s]  I don't get it. Fuck out of here. All right. This is where it gets hard.
[5486.60s -> 5494.47s]  All right. He's dead. Come on. I know I can do it.
[5514.42s -> 5535.21s]  Mama, I've done it again. That was a lot of screaming.
[5535.53s -> 5545.58s]  I was like a bat just came in my room and flew in and went right in my face like a pigeon got in here.
[5546.86s -> 5577.29s]  It's like da-da, da-da, da-da. But I said, God damn it, I have to emulate. Somebody told me the emulator
[5577.29s -> 5581.53s]  doesn't have this problem. Well, this is the original. We have to deal with how much it sucks.
[5605.24s -> 5608.20s]  I'm going to beat him this time. All right. I'm ready. Here we go. Here we go.
[5609.32s -> 5616.12s]  I'm not. Here we go. This is it. Here we go. I'm not doing it this time. I've done it twice already.
[5616.12s -> 5708.42s]  Imagine I did it. Pretend I did it. Here we go. Fuck. Don't fuck it up. Don't fuck it up.
[5708.42s -> 5712.46s]  It's hard, but don't screw it up. I got to have both hands with control here.
[5750.06s -> 5751.99s]  Here it is.
[5752.55s -> 5795.91s]  Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da. Please. The finale. Don't screw it up.
[5805.69s -> 5839.21s]  I did it. I win. My goodness. You win. And that's not even the last one. There's one more after this.
[5845.32s -> 5857.35s]  I missed a lot. It's okay. The final boss is even worse. Shit. No, I don't want to replay this game.
[5857.59s -> 5872.14s]  Oh, man. We're going to be here for a while.
[5872.22s -> 5880.70s]  I'm impressed. It seems the legends are true, but I've prepared the stage for the ultimate test.
[5880.70s -> 5886.94s]  Who's the true ruler of planet Gitaru? It will be decided once and for all here in Gitaru Arena.
[5886.94s -> 5897.02s]  No, it ain't just you wait. You're finished. You're the one who's finished,
[5897.02s -> 5903.34s]  Gitaru man. This time you will relinquish your Gitaru to me. Greatest Gravillian warrior, enter.
[5903.34s -> 5914.44s]  Wait, what? What? What the fuck? What? Lost your nerve? This girl has been
[5914.44s -> 5922.60s]  bred since birth to be our mightiest warrior. No. But I played the guitar.
[5924.44s -> 5929.80s]  Oh, it's you. You're the Gitaru man. Well, when I listen to you at the tree,
[5929.80s -> 5938.26s]  this is going to be real easy. No, I can't do it. Puma. She's the one person that I refuse to fight.
[5938.90s -> 5958.82s]  All right. I'm going to get this on first try. Controller sucks. The mechanics suck. The game
[5958.82s -> 5966.34s]  sucks. No. I mean, some of that's true, but no, we're not going to say that right now. We're going
[5966.34s -> 6047.53s]  to do it. All right. Good. We're doing country versus rock. I don't know which one. Hey, hey.
[6048.33s -> 6063.32s]  If I block it, I can't block it. What's he doing to me? Control split. What the? No. Come on.
[6064.84s -> 6066.60s]  Oh, I refuse to fight. Right.
[6089.50s -> 6090.14s]  No, get up.
[6090.14s -> 6103.85s]  No. That thing's not even a guitar. What is that thing?
[6111.94s -> 6131.30s]  Oh, getting called out. Wait, that's the song that I played at the tree.
[6131.30s -> 6141.94s]  And I sing now. Yeah. Nevermind. I'm just going to play.
[6181.26s -> 6201.16s]  My finger's falling off the fucking analog. We're playing it together.
[6230.34s -> 6253.32s]  It's my fingers up. My finger. What the fuck are you doing?
[6253.32s -> 6283.03s]  The people watching in the stands. This is kind of embarrassing. Oh, boy. I really,
[6283.03s -> 6286.31s]  really shouldn't have drank like that full pint of vodka before playing.
[6286.87s -> 6322.10s]  It was a mistake. It's a big deal for me right now. Did anybody notice? I got them all. You know
[6322.10s -> 6337.42s]  what happens now? You are the true guitar man. You are the true guitar man. What about the bad guy?
[6337.42s -> 6358.22s]  All right. Back to B. Good. B tier.
[6387.10s -> 6392.22s]  Incredible powers. Powers like what? Awesome powers that only the almighty,
[6392.22s -> 6397.42s]  well, anyway, it's the best guitar whoever. Well done, you won. The same clothes, too.
[6397.42s -> 6404.06s]  This last guitar was truly meant for you. The clothes? These small? We got them all, you won.
[6404.06s -> 6412.15s]  Nobody really did it. I didn't? Me? Maybe I'm not so pathetic after all. Here comes the not so fast.
[6412.15s -> 6417.42s]  Pathetic? No, you're not. There is nothing to fear, but here it's so.
[6420.68s -> 6427.48s]  Akira, you betrayed me. No, Zoe. I just finally realized that my music is not for fighting.
[6427.48s -> 6434.92s]  That's right. Go, Zoe. I hate you. Curse you, guitar man. I'll fight you myself.
[6434.92s -> 6441.08s]  My arm and guitar will blast you to smithereens. Eat this. No. You can do what you want. You can,
[6441.08s -> 6448.04s]  indeed. Silence. Silence yourself, Zoe. Go home. Go home? No, I won't go home. I'm going to rule
[6448.04s -> 6452.12s]  the universe with the last guitar. There's no future in your dreams, Zoe. All your goons are
[6452.12s -> 6457.32s]  gone. It's just you. What did you say, punk? You think I can't beat you by myself? You're just a
[6457.32s -> 6466.44s]  pathetic loser. You couldn't beat me in all of Neverending Eternity. Why you? Can't you do it?
[6466.44s -> 6471.08s]  So tell me, what do you do? I can do it. What, defeat me? I can't. No, not you. Can't you?
[6471.08s -> 6475.96s]  You're a loser. Am not. Always made fun of. No way. Always stuck. Never. Always running. No.
[6475.96s -> 6481.00s]  Always failing. No. Failing all things. No. Can't do anything. Yes, I can. This is the Venom movie.
[6481.00s -> 6485.72s]  I can do it. What can you do? I can do it. What? What can you do? Show me now. Sure, I can.
[6485.72s -> 6491.00s]  You miserable scrub. Show me all you've got. I can do it. I can. No, you can't. I can. There's no
[6491.00s -> 6496.28s]  way you can. You can't. You can't. Because I can. Because what? Because. Say it. Because what? I
[6496.28s -> 6506.07s]  can do it. Because. Because. Because I'm guitarist. Oh, the true power. The light. The light.
[6509.86s -> 6522.65s]  Did my voice change? This is going to be fun. What's the song though? That's important. What's
[6522.65s -> 6538.54s]  like the final battle song? It's actually Wonderwall. That joke was made a long time ago.
[6539.26s -> 6558.14s]  It's a... Today is going to be a day. Okay. I can't do that. I have to restart it.
[6558.70s -> 6646.58s]  Fuck. Why? What? What? Come on, quick. I skipped over the radio station a few times.
[6646.58s -> 6732.92s]  The bad reception. Yeah. I'm going to win. All right. This is where I'm going to do the damage.
[6780.79s -> 6812.57s]  All right. Come on. Look at his health. Like a full health. He ain't got nothing.
[6837.75s -> 6844.76s]  Nobody's just at the volume control. Putting it from 10 to zero over and over again.
[6876.38s -> 6881.26s]  I think I won. I lost here for a second. The legendary guitarist.
[6881.26s -> 6891.37s]  I was choking. I was choking there really hard at the end. But I did it. That's okay. Damn.
[6895.56s -> 6905.78s]  That was a lot. 32%. Great. 36% good. This is going to be an A.
[6906.42s -> 6916.42s]  Okay. What? Oh, because B is purple. Okay. I get it. It's all right. Whatever.
[6925.74s -> 6966.90s]  That song was wild. That was a good one. I did it. Hooray. It doesn't take much to turn impossible
[6967.54s -> 6975.98s]  into I'm possible. What? I've taken the leap. It's your turn. This is a bad ending.
[6985.35s -> 6989.35s]  Hey, you won. Why don't you give it up? You're starting to get on my nerves.
[6996.47s -> 7004.71s]  Here we go. Epilogue song. Come on. Epilogue song. Come on.
[7021.93s -> 7023.77s]  Do you know my name?
[7026.01s -> 7027.77s]  What does that mean?
[7036.41s -> 7043.16s]  You hard bone. I mean, I know there's more.
[7054.79s -> 7058.23s]  Do you play the game?
[7092.18s -> 7097.72s]  You can't hear me. Somebody said the game's only three hours. Perfect for someone with chronic
[7097.72s -> 7117.48s]  intestinal problems. You're right. What the fuck are you talking about? All right. Skip. Skip it.
[7147.29s -> 7163.66s]  The game is in. It's not open. And it was great. It's not open. The game must have even refunded
[7163.66s -> 7167.82s]  on steam. This is a collector's item. Why would I refund the collector's item?
[7173.58s -> 7197.74s]  PS2 steam game. Master's play. Oh no. Theater? What's theater? Oh, it's just the cut scenes.
[7201.94s -> 7214.06s]  Master's play. I just want to... There's more. Oh man. What is this? I don't know what that
[7214.06s -> 7229.29s]  would even mean. This is too much. I can't do this. I don't understand. This is Master's...
[7230.17s -> 7245.99s]  This is hard mode. What does it add? Just more timings? More beats and everything? What do you
[7245.99s -> 7352.70s]  think it does? It starts you at like no health. Spinning. Spinning. Spinning. No, it's not. I'm
[7352.70s -> 7440.28s]  doing fine. This guy. Is this guy the original? Come on. Come on. That was so close.
[7468.15s -> 7508.54s]  Got it. That was easy. No, not really. You win. This would be fun to play high as fuck.
[7511.35s -> 7524.04s]  I mean, or not. It could just be... It doesn't matter. It could be normal. We're going to hit
[7524.04s -> 7539.37s]  a wall. Probably the next song, I would say. I'm going to watch the cut scene.
[7541.29s -> 7560.57s]  All right. This one's going to be tricky. Don't skip lore. We already saw it.
[7561.45s -> 7567.75s]  I'm one of these I'm going to do sincerely tired Leon. It's going to be an embarrassment.
[7568.39s -> 7587.91s]  See if I can do it. I feel like I've improved a bit.
[7588.55s -> 7660.18s]  I'm not. No, I'm not. I did it. I did it. Fine. It fell down.
[7703.38s -> 7715.99s]  The PlayStation 2 is hooked up. I have a couple of secret PlayStation 2 games back here. Secret
[7715.99s -> 7734.22s]  ones that I have never played on this stream. Or I put in Um Jam and Lammy and we continue the
[7734.22s -> 7745.88s]  rhythm games. Probably Um Jam and Lammy requires... I have to switch out the PS2 and the PS1.
[7753.29s -> 7761.29s]  I actually do need to take a small break for reasons. I'm going to leave it up to you.
[7762.17s -> 7772.01s]  We'll do another couple hours. So let's do that. Let's be right back. I'll put a poll in here.
[7772.97s -> 7779.51s]  Either secret PlayStation 2 games, or game, or Um Jam and Lammy. That requires me to switch out
[7779.51s -> 7789.30s]  the PS1. Guitar Man is actually pretty fun. I might actually try to do like one or two more
[7789.30s -> 7797.78s]  levels in Guitar Man. It's fun. It's hard to control, but it's fun. Okay. Which one? Um Jammer,
[7799.85s -> 7807.75s]  Lammy, or secret PS2 game. Guess what? I don't even know what it is.
[7808.55s -> 7816.57s]  It could be anything because I don't even fucking know. All right. I'll be right back. I'm going to
[7816.57s -> 7828.44s]  be a couple minutes. So go grab a snack if you want to. I'll be right back. The PS2 is backwards
[7828.44s -> 7832.60s]  compatible. Are you fucking kidding me? Why would I do that? I almost just unhooked everything.
[7836.09s -> 7841.75s]  I forgot. Wow. Okay. All right. I'll be right back though anyways.
