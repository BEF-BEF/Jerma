[48.63s -> 67.56s]  What's going on? What's up? Who are we? I don't know. Chat? I mean, you're all individuals here.
[68.20s -> 79.14s]  I don't know who you all are, but I know you all are potential individuals. I don't know. Anyways,
[79.14s -> 93.43s]  hello. How are you? What drink is this? Uh, it is a water with some hydrating powder in it.
[93.43s -> 103.93s]  I need some hydration today. Feeling a little dehydrated. Have I seen Breath of the Wild 2
[103.93s -> 113.30s]  gameplay? Uh, I, no, I haven't. I, I need to beat the first one before I care about the second one
[115.14s -> 119.78s]  because I will see all the improved gameplay mechanics in the new one and then go, I don't
[119.78s -> 125.42s]  want to play the old one anymore. The second you show me like the new glider in the new Breath of
[125.42s -> 129.88s]  the Wild, it's like, well, I gotta wait like two weeks. I can just play that one. Three weeks,
[129.88s -> 137.30s]  whatever it is. Was it April, May? He's never going to finish Breath of the Wild 1. Well,
[137.30s -> 147.50s]  it's funny you say that because that's the exact plan after today. I think we are in the last,
[148.86s -> 155.08s]  I want to say like three or four hours of Resident Evil 4 depending on how long it takes.
[156.49s -> 163.75s]  Maybe four hours plus an hour of maybe the extra content. I'll try. Because what? Chapter 13,
[163.75s -> 176.84s]  14, right? No spoilers, please. Go back to sorcery or sorcery. I feel bad for sorcery.
[177.56s -> 187.46s]  I'm going back to Breath of the Wild, but not sorcery. Sorcery Shans in shambles right now.
[191.19s -> 203.22s]  That's a, hey, that was pretty cool. Everything started with an S. Sorcery Shans. Everything
[203.22s -> 207.54s]  has to have like, let's get 50 slugs. Steven is the title today. That's why I said that.
[208.74s -> 214.98s]  All right. You guys ready? Get through the rest of a Resident Evil 4. You guys good?
[217.70s -> 226.26s]  Alliteration. Yeah. Alliteration nerd. I have like a soft spot for alliteration.
[227.27s -> 241.24s]  California Circus of Maryland Magicians. 50 slugs. Steven. No, I'm not ready. Give me a minute. All
[241.24s -> 249.78s]  right. You get a minute. You get one minute. Hey, you gave me an extra 10 minutes. So I'm going to
[249.78s -> 256.92s]  give you an extra one minute. I think that's fair. I'll give you an extra one minute. That's fair.
[257.48s -> 269.80s]  Me too? All right. Everybody go. Go do what you got to do. You got one minute. Somebody just got
[269.80s -> 278.62s]  really annoyed because I started my stream and the of your washing machine just went off and you're
[278.62s -> 282.94s]  like, I have to go turn that over, dude. And it's going to take like 10 fucking minutes. Of course,
[282.94s -> 295.53s]  he started right when the washing machine went off. This guy should play Zomboid. I said I wanted to,
[295.53s -> 302.68s]  but I don't know. The game feels really involved. Is Project Zomboid a game where you have to really,
[302.68s -> 305.40s]  really know everything that's going on? I feel like I'm going to die in the first 10 minutes
[305.40s -> 314.01s]  and then go, wow, that was, I don't get it and leave. Is that possible? Seems like a really cool
[314.01s -> 331.10s]  game. That's the point. That's exactly what the point is. Huh. Okay. What about another FMV game
[331.10s -> 336.01s]  stream? There are a couple of FMV games that have come out that I want to play, but I feel like we
[336.01s -> 343.50s]  played a lot of the really, really important old ones. It is actually tough to find an FMV game
[343.50s -> 355.10s]  that I've not played on this stream. We've done them all almost. I played almost the entire FMV
[355.10s -> 369.08s]  catalog of 3DO games. And then before that too, on old PC, Bad Mojo is an FMV game. I did not play
[369.08s -> 373.00s]  that for like 20 minutes and I thought it was just, I couldn't control it well. Something was wrong.
[373.00s -> 377.40s]  I didn't, I didn't like it. I don't know why. Something was wrong with that. I tried to play it.
[378.20s -> 382.49s]  Maybe the port was fucked up and I couldn't capture it. It was something weird with that one.
[384.18s -> 390.94s]  All right. What about public domain movies? Yeah. Well, where's my headphones? Hold on.
[390.94s -> 464.86s]  I don't even know. They're not even here. Found them. What do you mean? Hello. I just, I told you
[464.86s -> 472.38s]  I had to go BRB for a second. What about the Dead Space remake? There's a lot of shit that
[472.38s -> 484.12s]  I really want to play. Well, we'll see. Let's get through this first. Resident Evil 4 chapter number
[486.71s -> 506.04s]  14. Oh, it's in the junk draw again. Well, the forest sequel. Oh shit. You guys can't see this one.
[506.04s -> 512.02s]  Hey, I don't know. Nah, I didn't, I didn't really play the forest one.
[520.17s -> 529.30s]  Final arc of the game, by the way. Don't even say it. Did your head get bigger?
[532.81s -> 535.77s]  I don't think so. Did my head get bigger in two days?
[536.33s -> 544.89s]  I guess I changed too. It just keeps slowly increasing in size.
[548.79s -> 557.37s]  I think I adjusted the camera. Yeah. This is the chapter that has the scary thing that I don't
[557.37s -> 571.45s]  like. So I'm preparing myself off cameraman. What do you think? You look like it's smelly today.
[571.45s -> 579.67s]  Yeah, you're probably right. Don't think too hard, handsome. See you later.
[579.67s -> 595.27s]  Hardcore run next, Howard. Yeah, I told you I'm going to, I'm going to stream standard.
[595.83s -> 598.87s]  I have a hardcore gaming mindset though. Very important for you to understand.
[603.51s -> 608.63s]  And then I'll do hardcore later. Hardcore is going to happen on my own time. I'm going to play if I
[608.63s -> 623.22s]  do. We've got Breath of the Wild to play. Tag me when Jerma lies. Oh, that's just your name.
[625.78s -> 638.87s]  Time that person off 30 seconds for having that name. Sniper rifle would be pretty,
[639.27s -> 646.38s]  let's avoid those pretty good here. No rifle. I, oh, by the way, for those of you that are wondering,
[646.38s -> 651.82s]  yes, I have a, the reason why the title is 50 slugs, Steven. If you've missed some of these
[651.82s -> 657.90s]  streams or if you missed the last one, we'll go over it very briefly. I put $300,000 into this
[657.90s -> 667.22s]  shotgun. It can hold 48 slugs and it shoots a slug every second. It seems to be working pretty
[667.22s -> 682.87s]  good. Striker Andy. Why is your voice so deep today? Oh, I had like a yogurt. I had like,
[682.87s -> 700.17s]  I had two yogurts and it made my like voice all yogurt-y. There you are. Nope. Wait. I don't want
[700.17s -> 708.79s]  to pass up any treasures. This thing's been really useful as well. At first I thought it was
[710.15s -> 716.38s]  fucking yogurt. I swear to God. Don't get scanned by this. I can take it up by shooting it, right?
[720.39s -> 729.19s]  I can't. All right. I'm not going that way. Does this kill you? Oh, wait, I go up there.
[738.58s -> 746.74s]  New items. This thing looks kind of cool and easy to handle. Oh, it's a magnum.
[751.86s -> 763.78s]  Okay. Do I, is it, which, which one is more powerful? This thing is 24, 27 at full power.
[764.18s -> 768.20s]  Knife needs care, everyone. That one, the killer seven is way more powerful.
[770.14s -> 784.01s]  Okay. That's the best magnum. Killer seven by far. Yeah. So I'm going to sell this.
[784.73s -> 790.70s]  It's not the best, but it's good. So I should sell this, get that one, and then start upgrading
[790.70s -> 799.14s]  that one. Butterfly does more damage. Does it? Are you sure? Butterfly technically has higher
[799.14s -> 809.62s]  power. What do you mean by that? The way this, if I get this, then this would be the one I'm going
[809.62s -> 815.05s]  to use. I'm going to keep this one. The exclusive on the butterfly is way more powerful. All right.
[815.05s -> 823.64s]  Well, then I'm going to keep this one. You can compare stats. I, but I think I have to own it.
[823.64s -> 834.26s]  Don't I? I think I have to own the weapon to compare stats. Don't I? Oh, no, I don't. All
[834.26s -> 852.33s]  right. I mean, but this thing is upgraded though. 24. This one's not even upgraded. I don't know.
[852.33s -> 855.13s]  I think this one's probably going to be stronger, but what's the exclusive on this?
[855.85s -> 865.27s]  The exclusive is what puts this over the top. All right. So yeah. All right. So 28, 27 of the
[865.27s -> 868.31s]  exclusive will put this one over the top. What's the exclusive on this one? Can I see it?
[873.91s -> 878.66s]  What is the exclusive on it? It's five times crit damage. All right. I'm going to keep the,
[878.66s -> 892.44s]  I'm keeping the one I have. This thing is done. Ooh. Okay. So let's get rid of these.
[896.79s -> 904.79s]  I could sell the golden egg. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's 10 grand. I'm just going to sell it.
[905.88s -> 912.26s]  Keep it. No, no, no. Keep it. Why? Sell the egg. It's 10 grand. It's 10,000. That's $10,000.
[912.82s -> 924.04s]  Well, I can't do anything else though. Another upgrade ticket.
[929.27s -> 932.71s]  You could make a golden omelet. That'd be kind of funny if that was real.
[934.44s -> 950.46s]  Is that real? That's not real, right? You can't make a golden omelet. Yes it is. There's no
[950.46s -> 958.30s]  golden omelet. You guys are full of shit. There's no golden omelet in this game. The golden omelet.
[958.30s -> 972.18s]  Really? Who cooks it? How do you make it? Yeah. You guys are full of shit. You guys are full of
[972.18s -> 976.82s]  shit. There's no golden omelet. I've played this game like fucking 10 times already. There's no
[976.82s -> 988.41s]  golden omelet. All right. Actually, thanks to the one, one guy that said to, uh, repair the knife
[988.41s -> 1031.77s]  because I would not have. What the hell is that? A nail gun? Oh my God. Oh shit. Run away. Whoa.
[1036.47s -> 1058.38s]  Oh my God. Watch out. I want to save ammo. Nice voice. Did I voice crack? I did? When? I got a
[1058.38s -> 1074.28s]  better idea. Okay. We just got, every time I start this game again, I have to, I got to get back into
[1074.28s -> 1088.38s]  the swing of it. 50 slugs even. Yeah. Well, I had no health. I didn't have any health. I need flash
[1088.38s -> 1110.06s]  bangs. Okay. I need some more of this. Here we go. Flash grenade. Thank you. That's going to help
[1110.06s -> 1115.16s]  immensely. I'm at max health, so I don't have to worry about yellow herbs anymore. Let's go ahead
[1115.16s -> 1124.65s]  and mix two of them. I do not care about yellow herbs. I have a max HP now. Nice yogurt voice.
[1130.60s -> 1138.89s]  Why did they harmonize that? That was very strange. All right. I'm going in now. Let's go.
[1175.45s -> 1178.25s]  You know what I'm talking about? You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[1181.93s -> 1201.91s]  Right? I hope people know what I mean by that. Where's he going? Is he running? Oh my God. He's
[1201.91s -> 1230.73s]  sprinting. Okay. Hold on. Yeah. I don't know why when I shoot this, I do that. If you watch
[1230.73s -> 1238.49s]  every time I've shot that shotgun, I've gone, yeah. Every time. Why? Why am I making that sound?
[1239.21s -> 1243.29s]  What's the point? Why am I doing that? I don't do that with anything else. Any other gun I have.
[1244.09s -> 1261.64s]  The guy holding two. Who did that? What was that? That guy just got lit the fuck up.
[1262.36s -> 1282.33s]  Don't do it. Don't do it. All right. We're good. He did the trope. He did the squibs.
[1283.30s -> 1290.89s]  The like, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. You know, I love that. That's like so the squib
[1290.89s -> 1305.85s]  attack on like the person's chest. Anytime that they do that in movies where it's like,
[1306.57s -> 1329.43s]  it's just like, what the fuck is going on here? What is a squib? The device that is in a vest
[1330.49s -> 1334.33s]  in movies and TV shows that has the little like spurt come out. Like as if it was
[1334.89s -> 1345.64s]  a, like a, like a getting shot. It's a little device that's made for movies. Can I move this?
[1346.28s -> 1371.24s]  It's all CGI now. It is. I think for the most part. They still do use practicals. Yeah. I mean,
[1371.80s -> 1378.71s]  depends on what movie, I guess. Right. Or what show. How do I get this milk voice out?
[1378.71s -> 1387.67s]  How do I cure milk voice? Anybody know? All right. Am I missing anything in here?
[1389.13s -> 1402.81s]  There are no treasures. I need more water. I got, hold on. Is that better? No, it's not.
[1403.90s -> 1410.55s]  I should probably lean into it then. Yeah. I think I'll lean into it then. I'm the guy with
[1410.55s -> 1415.19s]  a really, really deep voice and really kind of gravelly voice today. Yeah. I think I'll
[1415.19s -> 1426.90s]  lean into it. This is just going to shoot me if I walk into it. Okay. That's not an alarm.
[1426.90s -> 1433.38s]  That is the machine gun. Okay. So what did I, I need to move this. How do I do that? I want to
[1433.38s -> 1456.49s]  pick up the items. I can't climb in this. You live in that house. I'm back. Stop. Don't get me on
[1456.49s -> 1474.10s]  that. I, that's not an HD scanner. I thought, well, it technically is a scanner. Where does this move
[1474.10s -> 1485.29s]  to? Does that really even help? But hold on. I know I'm, I'm collect every item guy. I'm sorry.
[1485.29s -> 1499.88s]  I am. Can I not get that? I need to move this. How do I move this? There's a chest right here.
[1501.06s -> 1509.29s]  Wait, I don't even need to move it because I just moved to this, right? Oh, we're good.
[1510.01s -> 1532.39s]  There we go. All right. Got it. Go. Okay. We're good. Collect everything. Nice bangle. Yeah. It
[1532.39s -> 1542.94s]  is going to be a nice bangle when I sell it for 10, $15,000. You still have that. Got it on your
[1542.94s -> 1548.62s]  soundboard from the Wario where stream? Uh, no, that's, that's been cleared out. Unfortunately,
[1549.34s -> 1560.97s]  I think even scoring has gone. Sorry. Yeah. It's fucked up. It's actually pretty screwed up.
[1560.97s -> 1570.10s]  And I fucked this up again. How did I screw this up? No, I'm all right. Right. So to move this.
[1570.82s -> 1590.31s]  Yeah, we're good. Yeah. Scoring has gone too. I know I screwed up items. I actually do have
[1590.31s -> 1610.70s]  to conserve handgun ammo, so let's make this happen. Okay. Really? That's annoying. What the
[1610.70s -> 1620.17s]  fuck did you spit at me? What happened to conserving ammo? I just used everything.
[1621.05s -> 1653.90s]  Get this loaded up. How does that miss? How are these missing? Can you please lie so I can tag
[1653.90s -> 1672.68s]  that guy? Shoot him. Stop shooting. Shoot him. Pick what you want to do, Jeremy. Stop shooting.
[1672.68s -> 1693.74s]  Shoot him. Don't shoot. Stop shooting him. I didn't even lie. Watch out for it. Watch out.
[1693.74s -> 1709.32s]  Watch out. I shot that guy in the shoulder every single time. I got 50. Ooh, what's over there?
[1720.38s -> 1728.63s]  Shit. Shit. I missed that. It's all, it's all the way back. I can't get that from here. It's
[1728.63s -> 1739.54s]  all the way back. Shoot them in the knee cap. Could go back and get it. Is it actually a treasure
[1739.54s -> 1752.10s]  treasure? It's not on the map though. All right. I'm doing this only once. There they are. Okay.
[1752.10s -> 1759.61s]  It's a legendary treasure. I don't think it is, but I do want to go get it. How often do I trim
[1759.61s -> 1771.94s]  my nails? Um, it's going to be worth like 5k. Let's just see. The thing about Resident Evil
[1771.94s -> 1776.82s]  games, especially from four onward, is you really do want to get as many of those treasures as you
[1776.82s -> 1782.71s]  can. It just makes your life so much easier later. Upgrading everything you want. Spending all the
[1782.71s -> 1812.68s]  money. Here we go. Um, 600 and, uh, no, it was worth it. It was worth it. Ammo I didn't have
[1812.68s -> 1833.56s]  before. It was worth it. What was that? What is, what is this? Weird. Okay. Are you liking
[1833.56s -> 1844.23s]  this better than Resident Evil 2? No, I think, well, a lot of Resident Evil 2 is being chased,
[1845.26s -> 1848.46s]  which as you know, from my experience, the granny likes, I really don't like,
[1849.42s -> 1859.18s]  but in Resident Evil 2, it didn't feel, it, I was okay with that. I thought it was fine.
[1859.90s -> 1874.42s]  What's a granny like? Um, can we, how do I explain this? Granny like is when you have
[1874.42s -> 1883.06s]  to collect a bunch of items and, okay, let me, how do I spell this out? Okay. You open,
[1883.06s -> 1887.30s]  the game opens. You're in a house. You're in a, or you're in a grocery store. You're in a
[1887.94s -> 1894.50s]  mall or you're in a home. It doesn't matter where you are. And there's a piece of bubble gum
[1894.50s -> 1902.20s]  the next to you. It's a bubble gum. You got it. Okay. And then to your left is, uh, a sink
[1902.20s -> 1906.89s]  that's missing a pipe. And you don't know, you know, you're going to have to come back with a
[1906.89s -> 1913.51s]  fucking pipe to put on that sink, but you don't know where the pipe is. So eventually you end
[1913.51s -> 1919.27s]  up running around an hour or so later, 40 minutes later, you get a pipe and then you
[1919.27s -> 1923.91s]  have to go back and put the pipe on and then use the gum to plug up the sink. And then you
[1923.91s -> 1927.03s]  got to take the thing, the, the key that you get out of the sink and go put it into the floorboard
[1927.03s -> 1932.52s]  and then from the floor, but it's, it's just, and then all that time, all while you're doing that,
[1932.52s -> 1939.40s]  somebody is chasing you and you die if they get you. I don't like it. I don't like those.
[1940.04s -> 1954.23s]  That's a granny like, what does it have to do with grannies? Cause there's a very popular game
[1954.23s -> 1960.07s]  called granny where granny chases you around and you have to fucking pick up the floorboards and
[1960.07s -> 1968.39s]  put like gum into the sink and find the wrench to then like open the fucking door to the, the,
[1968.39s -> 1976.82s]  the, you know, the, the basement. It's granny. I want to kick you off here. Holy shit. That was
[1976.82s -> 1995.40s]  cool. Kill this guy. Like hello neighbor. Yes, exactly. That came out of alpha yet.
[1998.36s -> 2006.34s]  I have not heard about that game in like six years. Is this, I remember that game was like,
[2006.34s -> 2010.02s]  and it was like a, in alpha for a long time. I was like, Oh, what is this game?
[2013.53s -> 2018.41s]  Is it, is it actually still not out? No, no, I've seen like ads for like a sequel. It has to be out,
[2019.80s -> 2047.30s]  but that's a granny like it already has a sequel. Is it any good? I don't want to kill this guy
[2047.30s -> 2052.90s]  because I feel, I feel like he's trying to figure a puzzle out with a crowbar, which is exactly the
[2052.90s -> 2056.47s]  kind of person that I want to make sure stays around. This guy's trying to figure this out
[2056.47s -> 2068.63s]  with a crowbar and I feel really bad about this. Oh, that's what you were doing. He made pretty
[2068.63s -> 2080.73s]  good progress. It was one of the smarter of the zombies. I think you want, can you have a
[2080.73s -> 2086.25s]  Roblox stream? My mom really wants you to play Roblox. No, I'm not going to play Roblox. Not
[2086.25s -> 2090.78s]  right now. Probably not ever. Probably never. That's never, I'm just going to tell you right
[2090.78s -> 2096.50s]  now. That's never going to happen. I'm literally never going to play Roblox. Not that I don't,
[2096.50s -> 2101.62s]  I just, I just, I'm not going to, right? Like that's all I have to say. I don't need to explain why
[2101.62s -> 2105.54s]  I don't really want to. I don't need to tell you the reasoning. I'm just not going to do it.
[2105.54s -> 2110.66s]  And that's all that needs to be said. That's it. There's your answer. Are you going to play Roblox?
[2110.66s -> 2117.50s]  No, I'm not going to play Roblox at any point. I hope it's, I hope you have fun in Roblox.
[2117.50s -> 2123.18s]  Seems like a pretty interesting world. I'm never playing Roblox ever on this stream,
[2123.74s -> 2130.90s]  ever. You understand? It's, it is never happening. All right. Now when, like a year from now when I
[2130.90s -> 2146.76s]  do play it, you can tag that guy. All right. Did I get everything? I think I did. There's a,
[2146.76s -> 2151.08s]  there's a bunch of like little areas to go explore. Hold on. Is that one? Yeah, I don't,
[2151.08s -> 2161.78s]  I'm going to miss something, but who cares? Come on, sneak. This is really good looking though.
[2161.78s -> 2185.56s]  Rocket launcher. This isn't good. Night shot. You suck. Harry the rocket. I don't think you can,
[2185.56s -> 2210.65s]  man. Suplex. That did not even come close. What's wrong with that? Not bad, right? I have no need
[2210.65s -> 2218.78s]  for this, but I guess I'll just stick it in here, right? I'm at full house. It doesn't really matter.
[2219.34s -> 2228.49s]  Uh, can I take one more hit? I think I can. I can. I have body armor, so I definitely can take it.
[2250.06s -> 2280.10s]  Don't! What is it? Dead? Dead. When are you going to have a skincare product line come out?
[2280.10s -> 2315.80s]  What the hell is that sound? Oh, it's you. Skincare product? Going up there first. We're good,
[2315.80s -> 2327.45s]  right? Yeah. Treasures? Not listed. Oh, I need the map, don't I? Stop reading random ass messages,
[2327.45s -> 2334.28s]  Ella Mayo. Yeah, but isn't that like kind of, what do you mean stuff reading random ass messages?
[2334.84s -> 2342.79s]  What do you mean true? I'm streaming. I'm going to read some of the messages that come through.
[2343.35s -> 2363.83s]  Okay. I got a lot of gunpowder. I have 18 gunpowder. I need the little blue burrito,
[2363.83s -> 2392.04s]  whatever it is. What the hell is this? What is this? Remember April 5th. What's going on April 5th?
[2392.04s -> 2403.19s]  April 5th. Remember, remember. When are you going to play Roblox? I'll play Roblox on your birthday.
[2403.19s -> 2418.86s]  Okay. Next year. Oh, he's a page. So what? What do you mean? Yeah, next year. When's his birthday?
[2423.43s -> 2428.60s]  This doesn't hold off in court though. I could have been talking to anybody. I didn't know when
[2428.60s -> 2439.27s]  your birthday was. Could have been anybody's birthday. There's a paper trail on this.
[2441.91s -> 2446.39s]  I'm not playing Roblox like next week. I'm telling you that's not happening.
[2456.52s -> 2470.52s]  What if I watch a Roblox video or something? Is that sufficient for you? No, I'm not playing
[2470.52s -> 2479.08s]  Roblox. I'm not playing it. When I said next year, what I meant to say was I'll play Roblox on
[2479.08s -> 2489.56s]  your birthday. No. God damn it. Why does everybody have receipts? Like why do you have receipts on
[2489.56s -> 2495.80s]  this stream? Do you know what I'm saying? Like, come on. Why do you have receipts? I'm getting
[2495.80s -> 2505.93s]  red receipts right now. I never said I was going to. All right. When I say play Roblox,
[2506.65s -> 2512.92s]  if I open up the main menu, go like this. Do my options and then leave the game. It counts. I
[2512.92s -> 2565.43s]  opened it. I'm trying to shoot the thing. Oh my God. I'm alive. Go. Okay. Stab. You have to play
[2565.43s -> 2571.48s]  Roblox for 30 consecutive minutes. That's not part of the deal. I did. I just said I was going to
[2571.48s -> 2574.60s]  play it on your birthday and I don't even know whose birthday I was talking about. It was
[2574.60s -> 2588.31s]  misleading info. Misleading the witness. Leading. You're leading. I hear one of those bobbleheads.
[2590.01s -> 2598.55s]  Overruled. Objection, your honor. The witness, me, did not know that person's birthday
[2599.27s -> 2602.87s]  and I agreed to something that it wasn't in writing and it was no contract. There's no
[2602.87s -> 2606.55s]  verbal contract either because I didn't know exactly when the date was. I was never told that,
[2606.55s -> 2626.81s]  your honor. So, objection has been sustained. Thank you. Where is this thing? I can hear it.
[2626.81s -> 2686.79s]  Where is it? Where is this thing? Where is it? Where is this thing? Above you? I don't care.
[2686.79s -> 2693.56s]  Doesn't matter. All right. This is the treasure I gotta get. Somebody said I missed a treasure
[2693.56s -> 2702.87s]  with a barrel or something. I told my mother you're going to play Roblox. I don't want to play
[2702.87s -> 2712.34s]  Roblox. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. It's really far back. Is it really? No, it's not,
[2712.34s -> 2741.72s]  is it? This is a shortcut anyway. No, it's not. All right. I'm gone. But yeah. All right. How
[2741.72s -> 2746.74s]  about this? We'll take a deal here. On your birthday, I will sing you a Roblox-themed
[2746.74s -> 2752.26s]  happy birthday. We'll have a Roblox-themed birthday party for you. Like I'll get Roblox
[2752.74s -> 2758.02s]  plates and cups and like a Roblox thing that hangs with balloons, and then I'm not even
[2758.02s -> 2762.50s]  going to play the fucking game. That's a Roblox-themed birthday party. That doesn't
[2762.50s -> 2777.67s]  mean I'm going to have to play it. Do you accept my plea? My deal here? You know what the best part
[2777.67s -> 2782.71s]  about this? I don't even know who this person is. I have no idea who this is, but we're going to
[2782.71s -> 2800.78s]  have a birthday party for you. Okay. I fucking heard it too, and I just kept going. It's a binding.
[2800.78s -> 2805.83s]  Was that actually April 5th though? I don't want to do this. Actually, it's kind of funny.
[2805.83s -> 2816.82s]  Maybe I do. Ooh, nice. Why are you scared of Roblox? I'm not scared of Roblox. I just don't.
[2817.38s -> 2821.70s]  It's just like, I can tell you like five things that I really just don't think I want to do
[2823.30s -> 2827.86s]  in the next few months. And one of them is play Roblox. I just don't, this just doesn't do
[2827.86s -> 2832.39s]  anything for me. And I don't really want to. Like, it's just like, why, why would I, I just
[2832.39s -> 2838.04s]  don't want to play the game Roblox. You probably love it, but that's all right. This person is
[2838.04s -> 2856.62s]  going to get killed by this. No, you come to me. You come to me. He even was like, no, you come over
[2856.62s -> 2871.67s]  here. There was something else down there. This is game progress. I don't want to do that yet.
[2879.66s -> 2888.44s]  This is ultimate game progress. So nevermind. Okay. I'm supposed to check in to make sure
[2888.44s -> 2907.18s]  that didn't go anywhere. Have you ever been to Five Nights at Freddy's? The movie? You heard it
[2907.18s -> 2916.71s]  here. He's afraid of Roblox. That's fine. Just wait till our Roblox-themed birthday party.
[2920.54s -> 2923.42s]  You know what? I'm actually probably would rather play the game now that I think about it,
[2923.42s -> 2927.18s]  because then there'll be images of me on the internet wearing like a Roblox party hat
[2927.18s -> 2933.82s]  and like eating cake off of a Roblox plate at 40. I don't know if I really want those images
[2934.62s -> 2938.54s]  to be available to, you know, I don't think I want those images to be available.
[2954.36s -> 2963.72s]  Okay. Anything else in here? No. This is the worst part of the game coming up. This is the worst part
[2963.72s -> 2972.17s]  of the game. I got through my one out of two of my least favorite scary, I hate being in this zone
[2972.17s -> 2979.64s]  areas and now we have to do the other one. I really don't want to, but I love this game.
[2980.28s -> 2993.62s]  So I'm going to do it. It's coming up here soon. My mom's grounding me and taking away my phone.
[2993.62s -> 3012.55s]  Good. Good. Don't get off that thing. Don't use that fucking thing. Boomer. Good. Put that thing
[3012.55s -> 3027.82s]  down. Put that thing down. Why is he so mean tonight? Can I get an instant kill on the big guy?
[3034.22s -> 3040.54s]  Maybe I would have if I did it the right time. Okay. I don't want to use it. I'm not going to
[3040.54s -> 3064.22s]  use it. I'm going to go on. I'm going to, what are you doing? Got him. All right. Those things,
[3064.22s -> 3069.37s]  those guys are not as bad now with all the power I have. You look decrepit tonight.
[3078.98s -> 3085.00s]  Somebody wants a birthday party on the fifth. You want a birthday party though, right?
[3085.88s -> 3091.64s]  Need a key card. Where's my birthday party? I want a Roblox themed birthday party. You're ugly.
[3092.44s -> 3133.88s]  Spoiled, spoiled, spoiled. Hmm. Hmm. I need a card reader. Any trinkets? I'm looking for trinkets.
[3138.20s -> 3150.28s]  Why are you being so scary? What are you talking about? You actually blocked it with the axe.
[3150.92s -> 3193.02s]  Come on, go down. Down. Pretty good. Suplex. I'm actually really, really glad I got those.
[3193.02s -> 3211.08s]  Okay, cool. I asked you if you've visited the movie set of Five Nights at Freddy's. No, I have
[3211.08s -> 3227.40s]  not visited the movie set. Why would I be on the movie set of Five Nights at Freddy's? I can't lie
[3227.40s -> 3234.90s]  your way out of this one. The great Ace Attorney Chronicles you said on January 4th. Yeah, speaking
[3234.90s -> 3241.83s]  of attorneys, look at all these attorneys in chat. On January 4th, 2023, precisely 5 PM,
[3241.83s -> 3247.19s]  you stated on your live stream in front of 12,000 witnesses that you were going to play
[3247.19s -> 3261.50s]  Ace Attorney at exactly 6 PM. I am going to play that. I'll play Ace Attorney. Well,
[3263.06s -> 3268.23s]  I will. I never said I wasn't going to play Ace Attorney. I just said I wasn't going to play it
[3268.23s -> 3279.59s]  right now. Play it eventually. That's going to be a good chill stream, I think. Pam, look at those
[3279.59s -> 3289.16s]  reflexes. Finger was in nose, left hand was off keyboard, picking nose, looking over here,
[3289.16s -> 3294.74s]  talking to you. And I got that guy in the fucking head right when he jumped out. I don't want to
[3294.74s -> 3299.94s]  hear it anymore. Look at how slow this guy is in games. I don't want to hear it anymore.
[3299.94s -> 3311.56s]  I don't want to hear it. I'm mean today. I'm mean right now. Ooh, that's Full Heel.
[3323.67s -> 3324.39s]  Another crown.
[3324.39s -> 3330.07s]  She makes no difference. The price. Well, that's our choice to make.
[3330.07s -> 3338.74s]  I'm close to doing another 100k. I need, what do I need? I need a red. Yeah, I'm close to
[3338.74s -> 3352.09s]  getting another 100k. Thank you. Life needs care every once in a while.
[3353.43s -> 3363.56s]  This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little B goes a long way. You see. Dazzled,
[3363.64s -> 3376.74s]  are you? Go. Oh, you have resources. Good. I need these. I really need those.
[3381.43s -> 3395.30s]  Yes. All right. I got eight for that. All right. 40. I got 42 in here now.
[3397.42s -> 3400.70s]  The next revolver is coming up. Why do you keep upgrading that one? Because
[3400.70s -> 3404.46s]  that one with the exclusive upgrade does the most damage of all the revolvers, doesn't it?
[3409.96s -> 3422.79s]  Hmm. I need more of these. Where is the, there it is. Ooh, chicken egg. Not if the killer seven
[3422.79s -> 3431.34s]  crits. True, but how many times do I have to shoot to reliably get a crit? I wonder. Like,
[3431.34s -> 3438.58s]  what's the percentage chance? I wonder. Change the outfit. Actually, that's a good point. Yeah,
[3438.58s -> 3442.82s]  we can go back to the default now. The end of the game. We'll go back to the original. It's been,
[3442.82s -> 3448.66s]  it's been like 15 in-game hours or something since I had the original outfit on. I changed
[3448.66s -> 3455.59s]  that within like the first two or three hours, didn't I? Yeah, I'll put it back. Vote for the
[3455.59s -> 3460.71s]  final outfit. Now that's fair. That's fair. All right. We're going to start with, um,
[3461.43s -> 3470.73s]  let's start with Leon. Final outfit. I'm not changing it. Leon. Uh, I am going to veto one
[3470.73s -> 3496.33s]  of these because there's only room for four slots. So I am vetoing. I'm vetoing hero.
[3497.21s -> 3503.05s]  Nah, this was funny for a minute, but I'm vetoing hero. Your choices are default, villain, casual,
[3503.05s -> 3515.37s]  or romantic. Romantic, casual, hero. No, romantic, casual, villain, or default. Default, villain,
[3515.37s -> 3522.81s]  casual, romantic. This is it. I'm not changing this for the rest of the game. You guys get to
[3522.81s -> 3526.33s]  decide. And I know a lot of people are going to be mad at this because you're probably picking
[3526.33s -> 3538.81s]  the, wow. Actually, nevermind. I'm not going to say anything. Damn. Geez. Okay. I'm not going
[3538.81s -> 3546.06s]  to say anything. I don't want to influence the vote. There are actually five options for polls.
[3546.06s -> 3554.90s]  Yeah, but I don't want to weigh this one anymore. It's all good. It's close, but I don't think it's
[3554.90s -> 3562.62s]  close enough. It's close, but not really. You got like five seconds before we were just going to do
[3562.62s -> 3571.91s]  what we were going to do. 46% to 41% default versus romantic. You have literally three seconds.
[3575.61s -> 3584.68s]  Default wins. Thanks for playing. All right. Next, very important. Sunglasses on or off?
[3585.56s -> 3589.88s]  Sunglasses on or off for the final arc of the rest of the game. On or off? Sunglasses on or
[3589.88s -> 3604.97s]  off? It's very important. Plus, you know, this gives me a few minutes to take a sip of my drink
[3604.97s -> 3626.38s]  and buy some lip balm. Sunglasses on or off? Still close. Very close. Wow. The people want default.
[3626.38s -> 3632.41s]  Default. Everything default. Interesting. I guess it makes sense. There's only so much,
[3632.41s -> 3636.09s]  I guess, of the comedy outfits if you really want to see kind of how it plays out in the end of the
[3636.09s -> 3647.43s]  game. Yeah. Sunglasses off has kind of run away with it here. I don't think it's possible.
[3648.15s -> 3656.04s]  Almost 60% of the vote is for off. Sorry, everybody. Well, I apologize. A majority of you,
[3656.04s -> 3661.53s]  or at least a larger percentage of you want me to turn it off. All right, we're going default.
[3662.41s -> 3667.61s]  Now we have only two more things to care about. Ashley's costume for the rest of the game.
[3668.17s -> 3679.54s]  Default, casual, or romantic? Only three options here. Default. Stay with casual. Change back to
[3679.54s -> 3713.72s]  romantic. Make your choice. Romantic. Casual. Default. This is very split. Everyone has poor
[3713.72s -> 3722.94s]  taste. Well, here's the thing. It's spread out pretty evenly. So you all, you all disagree evenly.
[3725.51s -> 3736.20s]  It's like 40%, 20%, 37%. You guys seem to be equally in disagreement. So it's going to be close.
[3745.86s -> 3754.44s]  All right. That's it. Default. All right. The final decision you have to make is
[3755.48s -> 3759.56s]  Ashley's accessories. Default is sweeping, by the way. I'm just telling you.
[3760.68s -> 3768.15s]  No accessories. Just default, classic, nothing. Red hair, the Wellington glasses, or the mask.
[3768.87s -> 3783.22s]  Just go full on nothing. Just classic. Red hair, glasses, or mask. This one I'm actually interested
[3783.22s -> 3794.07s]  in. Wow. Default sweep. It's not even close. Actually, wait a minute. It is close. It is close.
[3794.07s -> 3800.39s]  Hold on. It's close. Red hair is really starting to come up here. This is too close to call now.
[3802.71s -> 3812.62s]  Uh-oh. Default has lost the race so far. Default is losing. Default is losing. I would click on
[3812.62s -> 3819.83s]  that button if you don't want to look at the thing you didn't want to see. I think red hair is,
[3819.83s -> 3831.10s]  no, hold on. You got like 10 seconds. Stop influencing. I saw what was happening,
[3831.10s -> 3835.26s]  so I started saying both of them. Default looks pretty cool. Red hair looks pretty cool,
[3835.26s -> 3842.89s]  right? Doesn't it? Which one? Either one. I don't know. Only one by about 100 votes.
[3843.77s -> 3850.36s]  Red hair it is. And we're not doing the filters. I'm not playing with those on. There you go.
[3850.36s -> 3867.45s]  Default everything, but Ashley has a red hair now, I guess. Okay, let's go. Wait, what is this?
[3870.52s -> 3879.78s]  Leatherjacket has contributed 550,000 channel points to that. Wait, what? What does that mean?
[3879.78s -> 3889.40s]  What does that mean? We enabled channel points to vote more. Oh, you can actually spend channel
[3889.40s -> 3904.38s]  money to vote. I wanted default. Hey, come on. All right, we're good. I'm going to eat this egg.
[3904.46s -> 3919.90s]  It's rigged. We're, we're not going back. All right, let's go. Wait, she has her trust right
[3919.90s -> 3932.17s]  here. There's another one in the other room. What do you mean rigged? We're getting to the
[3932.17s -> 3954.15s]  scary part of the game and I need to focus because it's scary. Key card. How's the audio?
[3954.15s -> 4002.89s]  We good? I'm gonna go this way first. I need a key card. Okay. Oh my God. I hate these things,
[4002.89s -> 4053.22s]  but they do. I don't, I don't hear it yet. They do it. Oh, they do it. They do it. They do it in
[4053.22s -> 4076.41s]  the remake too. Oh, I fucking hate it. I hate it. That, that. Oh, shut up. Okay. Dissection,
[4078.62s -> 4083.18s]  override card for level two clearance using the machine in the freezer. So I have to go to the
[4083.18s -> 4105.99s]  dissection, come to the freezer, scan it, and then some, somebody help me. Now we're going to go up
[4105.99s -> 4125.00s]  here. Wait, I'm, I am fucked here. I'm just realizing right now. I'm realizing right now
[4125.00s -> 4131.72s]  what's going on. Those of you that played the game before, how am I going to do this? I'm,
[4131.72s -> 4141.00s]  I fucked everything up big time. Oh, this is a disaster actually. How am I going to reliably
[4141.00s -> 4150.86s]  do this? Honestly, this is going to be my solution. It's going to have to be. I don't have a rifle.
[4150.86s -> 4186.81s]  It's going to have to be this. You know what I'm talking about. What do I do here? Is that on?
[4186.81s -> 4209.02s]  Right? That's on, right? Oh, I got to power both of them. I fucking hate using A and D. I just want
[4209.02s -> 4219.51s]  to use up or like W or use the mouse scroll. That's it, right? I got both of them on. How do I?
[4219.51s -> 4237.80s]  Yeah, two to two. That's it, right? Do I have to like activate it? Confirm it. Oh, okay. System
[4237.80s -> 4260.02s]  restored. I am so screwed. At last I have created new life. I call it the regenerator.
[4260.02s -> 4265.62s]  It's metabolic capacity is incredible. Unless all the parasites residing within the organism
[4265.62s -> 4273.22s]  are destroyed, its tissue can regenerate indefinitely. Upon examining the body with a
[4273.22s -> 4278.02s]  biosensor scope, I was able to confirm that the parasites behave like vital organs for the host,
[4278.02s -> 4285.74s]  almost as though it has multiple hearts. This new creation of mine is essentially immortal.
[4285.74s -> 4289.74s]  Surely even Dr. Frankenstein himself would want to shake my hand in admiration.
[4291.77s -> 4306.30s]  And then it fucking killed him. So for those of you that don't know, I'm just going to,
[4306.30s -> 4309.50s]  I know it's a spoiler, but I know the spoiler. So I'm just going to tell you what it is.
[4311.18s -> 4317.02s]  I can't see through their bodies. And you normally can, if you get this scope to do it.
[4317.02s -> 4330.81s]  And I'm not going to be able to, because I don't have a rifle. I'm in trouble. Or am I,
[4330.81s -> 4373.98s]  or am I actually in trouble? What's wrong with this? Oh my God, dude. That was the worst fucking
[4373.98s -> 4378.14s]  scare I think I had in like a year. And that was, I like knew it was going to happen to that fucked
[4378.14s -> 4384.84s]  up my whole brain. Oh my God, that was bad. Wow. Why was it that one? Why was it? I knew, I did,
[4384.84s -> 4390.76s]  he, I knew he was coming, but I thought it was slower than that. I thought it was much slower
[4390.76s -> 4394.52s]  than that. It was the fact, there was a lot of things going on there. First of all, I thought
[4394.52s -> 4398.84s]  that I had the key card and I was going to swipe it, but I didn't. I don't have the key card. And
[4398.84s -> 4407.06s]  then I looked down the hallway. He wasn't there. Nice fake YouTube jumpscare. It wasn't. It was
[4407.06s -> 4413.40s]  real. Um, but a lot of factors there. There really were a lot of factors on that. I looked
[4413.40s -> 4416.92s]  down the hallway and there was nothing there. And then I, he turned around. There was immediately
[4416.92s -> 4421.77s]  somebody right there. This doesn't have power either. What, what actually does have power right
[4421.77s -> 4446.81s]  now? Oh, I'm in trouble. I'm going to have to, you can't come in here, but where is he? I can't go in
[4446.81s -> 4457.62s]  the freezer. I can't go in here. So I need to go down here. Okay. So I got to go left, right, right.
[4457.62s -> 4463.59s]  Buy a rifle right now. Let me see that scare. I want to see how embarrassing it was. I mean,
[4463.59s -> 4475.75s]  it was probably really embarrassing. What's wrong with this? What's wrong with this?
[4477.03s -> 4483.96s]  That really does look like a YouTube thumbnail. It's, he's grabbing, he's got his hands locked
[4483.96s -> 4496.07s]  around my head and it's screaming. My limiter, my limiter on my microphone was working over time
[4496.07s -> 4523.06s]  on that one, by the way. He doesn't sell it, does he? I thought he sold it. Go get the SMG
[4523.06s -> 4529.35s]  in the freezer. Oh shit. I know you're right. Okay. Okay. I thought I was screwed for a second.
[4529.35s -> 4540.25s]  All right. I'm going to heal full health with the bass and just run. Oh, I need to do this.
[4554.60s -> 4566.09s]  It was so loud. I just, whatever. I don't think any of this really matters right now.
[4569.08s -> 4581.69s]  I guess I'll put on the, this, get the rifle. I don't have the money for the rifle.
[4582.17s -> 4588.71s]  I'll be all right. I just have to, I just have to get to where I need to go and I'm just going to
[4588.71s -> 4594.66s]  run. I'm going to save it right here. I knew I was going to hate this part. It's just me remembering
[4594.66s -> 4660.58s]  how much I hated this when I was younger. Okay. It's left, right, right. Go. Okay. Left and then
[4660.58s -> 4691.54s]  straight across. Oh, there's more than one. Oh, and I have two to deal with this too. I have to deal
[4691.54s -> 4710.02s]  with this now. I have to, I have to deal with this. Did I get them all? I got them all. I got
[4710.02s -> 4745.62s]  them all. 28 slugs, Steven. It was worth it. I got rid of all the parasites. That's going to have
[4745.62s -> 4759.05s]  to be the play if I don't get the scope. There's another one just hanging out here. Okay. I got
[4759.05s -> 4818.10s]  three to power. Come on. I got to get that last one. There it is. Oh boy. I got it. Ooh, an LE5.
[4818.10s -> 4837.40s]  There it is. And I can put the scope on this. Where do I get that scope though? I don't know
[4837.40s -> 4851.91s]  where I get the scope. So you get it later. Okay. So now I got to go. I have level two.
[4851.91s -> 4859.64s]  So level two gets me to the down here. So I need to power this back up over here. Go back to this
[4859.64s -> 4864.97s]  room, switch it back to here, and then go here. All right. So I don't want to fight this thing.
[4864.97s -> 4870.86s]  So I'm going to go straight left straight, which maybe I should just kill it. I'm just going to
[4870.86s -> 4898.47s]  kill it. I've got, I've got my, I'm going for it again. Thank God. Okay. All right. All right. I
[4898.47s -> 4906.18s]  don't, I'm good. I ran out of bullets, but that's all right. That's exactly why I wanted to have
[4906.18s -> 4914.36s]  that weapon. That weapon is precisely what I wanted to do with it. Okay. So now I got to go
[4914.36s -> 4936.97s]  back around here. How are this? Another one's probably going to spawn. Now I got to go back
[4936.97s -> 4965.54s]  around here and then that is the end of that. Okay. This is it. Can I, can I have an egg? Can
[4965.54s -> 4975.86s]  I have an egg, please? Just give me one egg. That's all I want. What the fuck is going on?
[4975.86s -> 4986.70s]  Wait, what? Wasn't this powering over here? And I switched it to be powering over here. No,
[4986.70s -> 4990.46s]  it was already pop. Oh, I thought I had to put it. I thought the power was this.
[4990.46s -> 4995.72s]  And then the second power was over here. Oh shit. I turned it off. I thought it was,
[4995.72s -> 5013.83s]  but it was whatever. No eggs. Okay. All right. Yeah. That's, that's what I could look at the
[5013.83s -> 5022.78s]  map though. It doesn't look like it's, um, yeah, like this is now powered down. Oh no, it's not
[5022.78s -> 5040.54s]  shit. Okay. Okay. Something's going to jump scare me. It's going to be another one and I
[5040.54s -> 5044.38s]  have to be ready and I can't use all of my shotgun bullets. It's going to the freezer again.
[5045.10s -> 5077.37s]  Just wait. Here comes something, right? You can hear it. Ah, I thought they were talking.
[5077.93s -> 5132.79s]  Where are they? All right. Come on up here. Don't the fuck. Why is it making that weird
[5132.79s -> 5154.33s]  like banger boys sound? Why is it doing that? Don't play Resident Evil 4 at 3 a.m.
[5154.33s -> 5170.31s]  Yep. Fucking thumbnails, man. We like to party. We like, we like to party. We like to party.
[5176.84s -> 5182.68s]  That used to just absolutely amp everybody up big time when that song would play. Those of you that
[5182.68s -> 5186.44s]  were around and that song was really popular, you would hear that and it would be like,
[5187.61s -> 5193.37s]  holy shit, it's about to get real. It's going to be an incredibly fun party right now.
[5196.39s -> 5210.39s]  In mere moments, everyone's going to have a great time in moments, moments from now.
[5210.39s -> 5216.36s]  Back during like a wedding, grandma and grandpa get up for that one too. You know, that, you know,
[5216.36s -> 5219.48s]  grandma and grandpa kind of sitting there, you know, chilling out for most of the wedding. And
[5219.48s -> 5229.00s]  then all of a sudden it's like, okay, I'm getting up for this one. And the grandma gets up. Grandpa
[5229.00s -> 5232.92s]  gets up. The whole family gets up. Every friend gets up. There's nobody sitting down when that
[5232.92s -> 5247.10s]  song was played. They all do the same like, it's just kind of like this up, like, let's go.
[5252.98s -> 5279.48s]  I'm looking forward to being, to being that guy. Okay. Let's keep playing. What? Shit. Okay.
[5279.48s -> 5325.03s]  They're all going to break out of here. So I am not fighting any more of these. What's this herb?
[5325.03s -> 5345.14s]  That's my favorite color. Teal. During a recent power outage, a test subject awoke from cryogenic
[5345.14s -> 5352.20s]  status, broke out of his holding tank and escaped. The subject was contained after 20 hours,
[5352.20s -> 5357.56s]  leaving seven dead and 19 wounded. We were unable to recover one of the bodies in a tool from inside
[5357.56s -> 5363.91s]  of it. Cause of this unfortunate incident is the unstable power supply. The outdated generators
[5363.91s -> 5368.76s]  cannot keep up with our demanding schedule. Management must prioritize the needs of the
[5368.76s -> 5377.62s]  engineers of those of the researchers to prevent something that's ever happening again. Thank God.
[5382.41s -> 5391.58s]  Thank God. Because now I can actually do this correctly. You see what's going on here?
[5395.42s -> 5401.18s]  You don't know where they are in the body. That's why I was shooting at the shotgun. If these are
[5401.18s -> 5406.62s]  not all destroyed at the same time, within a second or two of each other, they don't die.
[5417.08s -> 5427.45s]  All right. Should I kill them? Can I kill them now? When they're inside of this or no? I feel
[5427.45s -> 5452.86s]  like I probably should do it. I'm going to do it. This thing sucks. It has no power to die.
[5453.50s -> 5470.65s]  This thing sucks. This thing doesn't hurt anything. Yeah. I have to, I have to go like
[5471.69s -> 5477.74s]  to do one. I only have 30 bullets. What am I doing? What's your opinion on cheese?
[5478.46s -> 5488.70s]  All right. Well, I got another, um, yeah, I am pulling this person right now.
[5490.42s -> 5496.02s]  Where? Okay. So all of your, they're all in like this mid section area. Okay. I got it. Ready?
[5504.98s -> 5534.07s]  Whoa. I get them all. I didn't get them all. Oh my God. That's it. That's it. That's it. Okay.
[5534.07s -> 5542.68s]  You missed both of them. I don't know how I did that. Oh God. I hate this area so much.
[5542.68s -> 5549.88s]  I just, I just get so panicky and so high strung. What's going on? Oh, it's blocked.
[5550.52s -> 5590.28s]  How do I unblock it? Why is it blocked up? That shit's all blocked up over here. Why can I use
[5590.28s -> 5599.35s]  this? It's all blocked off. I need to like power it on. All right. There's the terminal key card
[5599.35s -> 5628.31s]  lock down here. Maybe you only need to kill one of them. Read the note. Wait, what? So what? The
[5628.31s -> 5647.77s]  tool. So what though? But we're good tool. Wait, what? What's going on? This is the tool. Grab the
[5647.77s -> 5661.46s]  tool. What tool? They both died right here. There's nothing on the ground inside the enemy. There's
[5662.42s -> 5675.38s]  nothing on the ground. There are more. Oh, there are more. Oh, there are more. Oh, no, there are
[5675.38s -> 5688.86s]  more. And there's the tool. There's the wrench that's inside of the person's stomach. I've been
[5688.86s -> 5698.42s]  looking at it like this and there are two more and you, I am in a lot of trouble, but you know what?
[5698.42s -> 5706.04s]  Let's make this happen correctly. No excuses. Do it. I got scared. I got scared and had to run.
[5713.74s -> 5754.12s]  This weapon sucks, dude. Fuck off me. I want to fucking quit the game. I want to restart so bad.
[5754.68s -> 5784.50s]  Fuck you. Let me stop pretending. Guys, I can't, I don't know where they are. And I'm, I didn't
[5785.06s -> 5790.41s]  buy a, I didn't buy a rifle. So these bullets don't fucking hurt anything.
[5791.74s -> 5795.02s]  So I have to see where the parasites are and then switch to a different weapon.
[5795.66s -> 5811.94s]  I'm good. I got the tool. I'm good. There's something in here. You have no ammo. I'll be good.
[5812.66s -> 5823.30s]  Don't worry. I'll be fine. It could go worse the next time. Where is this thing? It's like hanging
[5823.30s -> 5837.62s]  right here. I'll be good. Trust me. I'll be good. Oh, by the way, it turns out that everyone telling
[5837.62s -> 5844.23s]  me that the deluxe edition had cheating maps was a liar because that's not real. You guys just made
[5844.23s -> 5853.38s]  that up. So that's why I have been, I have not been buying the treasure maps because everyone
[5853.38s -> 5857.86s]  told me I was a cheater and I bought the deluxe edition, which gave me access to all the treasures
[5857.86s -> 5860.58s]  and everyone was like, Oh, he's a cheater. And I was like, Oh, I don't have to buy those.
[5860.58s -> 5869.18s]  Turns out that's not real. That's not accurate. Thank you for that one. All right. I got the tool.
[5870.06s -> 5883.93s]  I got the treasure. You only had to kill one of these things. Yeah. But I was scared that they
[5883.93s -> 5893.53s]  were going to all break out and it was going to open up and kill me. It was just for the first
[5893.53s -> 5910.41s]  area. Yeah. I have to do this right. So bear with me here. This guy will do it for me.
[5911.05s -> 5918.66s]  That hit me right in the head. How did you, how did they perfectly do that? That is so annoying
[5918.66s -> 5930.68s]  right now. How did they do that? So flawlessly. Okay. That's what I wanted to do. Oh my God. I
[5930.68s -> 5938.76s]  broke one out with the grenade. No, that's not good. That's very bad. That is exceptionally bad.
[5939.72s -> 5947.32s]  I have to kill this thing right now. Is it dead? Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.
[5947.96s -> 5997.62s]  Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Wait, I can, I can, I have an idea. Stop it. I'm dead. Throw it at me.
[5997.62s -> 6008.73s]  Throw it. Dude, throw that at me already. Thank you. Jesus. This is a fucking disaster, dude. I
[6008.73s -> 6015.27s]  really should just die. I should just die. This is a disaster. This is a fucking disaster.
[6016.15s -> 6027.61s]  Just kill me. This is a disaster. I have no bullets. I opened up all four of those chambers.
[6027.61s -> 6037.75s]  This is an absolute fucking disaster. You could leave. Yeah, but I used all my ammo. I just have
[6037.75s -> 6046.57s]  to kill the one. Where am I? All right. Okay. We're good. Everybody relax. Everything is now
[6046.65s -> 6053.37s]  situated. I don't have to waste like 200 rounds trying to shoot the stupid fucking parasites in
[6053.37s -> 6079.34s]  their bellies. Okay. Here we go. There's ammo somewhere, isn't there? I know I picked it up.
[6079.34s -> 6088.49s]  Where is it? Okay. I just have to get this right. I have to, with the 20 shots in this weapon that
[6088.49s -> 6097.06s]  has no upgrades in it, I have to get, I have to kill this one person and then I'm going to run out
[6097.06s -> 6112.18s]  of this room. Okay. We ready? No more messing around. No more bullshit. I'm doing this now.
[6112.82s -> 6129.11s]  Can you play the song? Sure. I just typed in Vengaboy's song. It's probably going to be the
[6129.11s -> 6145.43s]  first one. Yeah, it is. All right. I'm going to turn it down just a little bit. I'll activate
[6145.43s -> 6163.03s]  the encounter and go, Oh, here comes grandma. I don't, why am I doing this? All right. Here we
[6163.03s -> 6264.41s]  go. It's time to go. Watch out. Oh shit. Why is this to the beat of the song? What are you doing?
[6264.41s -> 6313.48s]  Who's got me? Call me. The song didn't help. It made everything worse. You know what? Fuck it.
[6313.48s -> 6319.37s]  I got an idea. I'm going to just, I'm just going to cause mayhem right now. I'm just going to go,
[6319.37s -> 6328.18s]  I'm going full mayhem mode. Now, wait, maybe crazy frog will help. Not a bad idea. Not a bad idea.
[6328.18s -> 6386.38s]  Crazy frog could help. It's not a bad option here. What's going on? I still want to shoot this.
[6386.94s -> 6395.26s]  This is on the handgun. No, how do I put this down? Why is this even on the bar right now? Why is
[6395.26s -> 6469.26s]  this on the bar? I'm fucking pissed now. Eat shit everybody. Where's the key? I don't care anymore.
[6469.26s -> 6480.10s]  We're doing fucking relaxing music. Play peanut butter jelly. Oh, that's a good one too. That's
[6480.10s -> 6495.86s]  right. I will beat it to one of these songs. I promise. All right. Peanut butter jelly song.
[6497.08s -> 6504.94s]  All right. This is, I don't think this is it. This is not the peanut butter jelly song,
[6506.65s -> 6521.35s]  but it's going to stay. Let's go.
[6521.35s -> 6532.31s]  Peanut butter jelly. Then you take the peanuts and you mash them, you mash them, you mash them,
[6532.31s -> 6541.51s]  mash them, mash them. Leon singing. Oh, you're fucking me up so bad.
[6546.90s -> 6547.94s]  Leon is singing.
[6547.94s -> 6565.78s]  Peanut butter jelly. No. God damn it. Die. Please.
[6571.16s -> 6593.16s]  I can't do this. This song goes fucking hard by the way. Shit. No.
[6594.12s -> 6599.24s]  Eat it, eat it, eat it. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm fucked here.
[6601.94s -> 6606.58s]  Don't blow anything up. I have to go for it. All right. Quiet, quiet, quiet. That song was
[6606.58s -> 6613.14s]  pretty cool, but all right. Hold on. I need to see where they are. All right. They're on the belly
[6613.14s -> 6620.34s]  and then on the neck line. Belly, neck. And then on the neck, on the neck, on the neck.
[6625.66s -> 6652.70s]  Just give me the key card and give me the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6655.26s -> 6673.48s]  Peanut, peanut butter. The fact that people say that was Leon singing made that a hundred
[6673.48s -> 6689.78s]  fucking times funnier. Okay. I need to go back for the items. It was Ashley too. Oh, that's so
[6689.78s -> 6733.40s]  fucking funny. That's so stupid. Whatever, whatever, whatever. It doesn't matter. We're gone.
[6733.40s -> 6751.18s]  I missed a, an error, but it's fine. It's okay. Peanut butter jelly song. That was not right,
[6751.18s -> 6762.38s]  but it's okay. Peanut. You missed a lot more than that. I don't want to go back there.
[6762.38s -> 6779.86s]  I really don't. There is handgun ammo down here though, which I will take. I think that's good.
[6782.02s -> 6801.54s]  Yeah. Hold on. Yeah. Yes. Yes. All right. We can finally leave my, one of my least favorite zones.
[6801.54s -> 6808.58s]  It does get worse though. If I remember it gets a little worse. What is this? What does this want
[6808.58s -> 6823.66s]  me to do here? Gap in the wall. Oh, that's for when I think when Ashley's back. Yeah. Okay. Well,
[6823.66s -> 6861.75s]  that was an interesting journey. That was fun. Yeah. The red hair is still there. It was voted on.
[6861.75s -> 6873.13s]  Did it work? Having a leveled up rifle makes a huge difference here. Yeah. I got through it.
[6876.12s -> 6880.36s]  I just shouldn't sell that gun because the regenerators are now enemies going forward.
[6881.24s -> 6904.18s]  So I don't want to have to deal with that again. That's surprising considering how
[6904.18s -> 6907.70s]  panicky I was with the shotgun. Although I guess the shotgun is hard to miss with.
[6907.70s -> 6945.40s]  Getting close. Only a couple more chapters remain. Thank you. Can you stand? Where's Luis?
[6945.40s -> 6961.29s]  He's worried about you till the end. Come on. We don't have much time. Let's get rid of these
[6961.29s -> 6973.90s]  things for Luis. Let's go get that item. Yeah. Come in. There's a lab where we can remove the
[6973.90s -> 6981.13s]  parasites. Had a crazy hunch that you'd know where it is. Their most important facilities are house
[6981.13s -> 6991.91s]  and their sanctuary at the top of the mountain. That's where I'd look. Crystal ore? Crystal ore?
[6992.79s -> 6999.69s]  What the hell is that? This is such a little book. How do you even write in this?
[7000.49s -> 7008.81s]  This thing is tiny. We were imprisoned without warning. One by one we are taken to the next
[7008.81s -> 7016.09s]  room. I do not know what happens there. They just took Annabelle. I'm probably next. I've got to
[7016.09s -> 7022.02s]  think. Need to get my head straight. All who are infected with the plaga will be at the mercy of
[7022.02s -> 7028.02s]  Lord Saddler. If he commands it, they will work. If he commands it, they will work themselves to
[7028.02s -> 7032.68s]  death with a smile on their face. Adversely, the host becomes so simple-minded that they're
[7032.68s -> 7038.76s]  basically useless for any complex task. However, we succeeded in developing the new superior
[7038.76s -> 7044.36s]  species of plaga. It has no special variability. But the host's cognitive functions are not
[7044.36s -> 7050.12s]  diminished. Seems like they plan to administer this new species to the girl. Clearly important
[7050.12s -> 7055.64s]  that she maintains her intelligence after infection. All tests were successful and
[7055.64s -> 7060.63s]  plans for mass production are moving forward. The project is a complete success. But I've been
[7060.63s -> 7066.44s]  imprisoned. And preparations to inject me with the superior species are underway in the next room.
[7067.40s -> 7073.48s]  Annabelle is not herself anymore. The smile has been wiped completely from her face. Writing is
[7073.48s -> 7093.50s]  the only thing that keeps me sane now. Not that anyone will ever read this. Oh, it's another 100%
[7093.50s -> 7107.91s]  heal. I kind of just fucked that up. But whatever. Doesn't matter. We're at the end game. Doesn't
[7107.91s -> 7120.36s]  matter. Give me more than six. I got to replenish this. I have to use the bolt gun for a while now
[7120.36s -> 7139.94s]  because I need to replenish the shotgun shells. Okay. Is grotto be shipping soon? Grotto beasts
[7139.94s -> 7144.98s]  is shipping soon. I imagine a lot of people are going to start to in the first pass here,
[7145.54s -> 7150.66s]  are going to start to get stuff within the next week or two. I'd be on the lookout if you ordered
[7150.66s -> 7158.60s]  very early in the presale. Stuff is going to start shipping here really soon. So I would just be on
[7158.60s -> 7177.50s]  the lookout over the next week or two, I'd say. Take a look. It is dropping soon. Okay, there we
[7177.50s -> 7198.38s]  go. Blue hair. Blue hair versus red hair. Can we get a vote, please? Are we changing from red to
[7198.38s -> 7214.02s]  blue? Yes or no. You're going to need to make this decision very quickly. Blue medallions in here.
[7214.02s -> 7224.52s]  They're scattered around. Okay. Oh, there's a shooting range. Nice. Okay, cool.
[7233.35s -> 7250.38s]  Some powder. What the hell just happened to my voice? I got a purple gem, didn't I? All right,
[7250.38s -> 7263.91s]  how close am I to doing this? Pull everything out. Red. Oh, red's the cheapest. Pull that out.
[7266.63s -> 7277.18s]  So yellow, blue, purple, red, green. I need a red and a green one and I can do another crown for
[7277.18s -> 7307.30s]  100k. I got this. I have a lot of coins already. I need way more squares. I don't need these
[7307.30s -> 7314.87s]  anymore, right? That's the reason why they're here. Wow, blue. Absolutely destroyed. Okay,
[7318.46s -> 7336.23s]  I'll do that real quick right now. Real quick. Where's the... All right, blue hair. You can do
[7336.23s -> 7346.44s]  it without leaving? I don't think you can. I think we tried before. Blue hair. Let's go.
[7348.71s -> 7368.81s]  The accessories. Ah, okay. You can't do the clothing. You ready for the reveal? Okay. Miku.
[7371.11s -> 7376.14s]  All right, we... This is upgraded all the way.
[7386.76s -> 7393.10s]  Try that on for size. Once we get this thing all the way, we'll be good.
[7394.46s -> 7398.97s]  Wait, you got new stuff? What do you got? Resources. I need these.
[7400.02s -> 7405.82s]  You get some bet I don't come back. Shit, I need more gunpowder.
[7408.78s -> 7440.60s]  Let's do this. New game. Okay, 4A, Punisher and the Riot Gun, Bolt Thrower, and then everything.
[7440.60s -> 7469.93s]  Oh, dear. Okay. So, what... I got... Sorry. Do they ever connect all the way?
[7501.69s -> 7513.64s]  How do you... I need to... I didn't know... I'm just trying to figure out how to... I don't even know
[7513.64s -> 7521.74s]  the fuck that was happening. It's the first time I've ever seen it. It's the first time... Oh, please.
[7522.46s -> 7526.74s]  Hey, Jerma, it's the first time you've ever seen this. How come you didn't get it the first time?
[7526.74s -> 7559.77s]  It's annoying. Stop reloading when you don't need to. What do I even have the shotgun for?
[7560.33s -> 7610.87s]  What's the bonus condition? What the hell was that? What the hell are you talking about?
[7611.43s -> 7622.89s]  Why is there so much travel time on them in this mini-game? There's not that much travel time on
[7622.89s -> 7632.74s]  this. Dude, there ain't this... I swear to God, there's not this much travel time on these bullets.
[7645.94s -> 7654.04s]  Dude, what is going on? This thing doesn't suck this much in real life. Like, in the real game.
[7654.60s -> 7687.62s]  Am I wasting these or do I get an infinite amount of these? I have no idea. I'm not wasting... Okay,
[7687.62s -> 7698.39s]  I get four. All right, all right, all right. I don't care about getting... No, no, no, no, no,
[7698.71s -> 7726.82s]  just do it. I don't care. It's moving. That was pretty good. That's probably a... It's taking us.
[7726.82s -> 7733.99s]  All right, we're good. We're good. We're good. This one's going to be horrible. So I'm just going
[7733.99s -> 7769.93s]  for like a B on this one. I'm going for a B on this one. Oh, my God. Wait, it's not... I don't like
[7769.93s -> 7775.16s]  switching weapons. Just give me one. I hate switching weapons. It's like the worst. I don't
[7775.16s -> 7784.78s]  care about any of this. I hate switching weapons. I didn't even know that could be... I just haven't
[7784.78s -> 7810.23s]  used the rifle the whole game. I didn't know you could do that. I want to hit two. My fingers are
[7810.23s -> 7835.80s]  so huge. They just hit every button when I press three. Use a machine gun. I don't even care.
[7835.80s -> 7846.23s]  I just want to get a silver coin. I'm not doing this. I don't care. Just give me a fucking A.
[7846.23s -> 7851.43s]  I don't care. B. I don't care. Good. Let's go. That's fine. I am not doing that ever again.
[7852.68s -> 7858.04s]  You know what the problem is? So on a mechanical keyboard, the buttons are spaced out. So this is
[7858.92s -> 7865.70s]  a mechanical keyboard. There's like a huge gap between every single button on a mechanical keyboard.
[7865.70s -> 7874.95s]  I get stuck in the middle. I'll go to press three and I'll go in the middle. I need a mesh keyboard.
[7874.95s -> 7883.26s]  I'm not a gamer anymore. Give me my mesh keyboard back. Give me a mesh keyboard. This doesn't happen.
[7883.26s -> 7903.22s]  All right. This is the last time we're probably going to be able to do this. That's pretty good.
[7903.22s -> 7913.14s]  It would have been nice a lot earlier. Let's conserve them now. Conserve it. Legendary.
[7913.14s -> 7966.68s]  Legendary. No. No. Oh, that's actually great. That's really good. That's actually exactly what
[7966.68s -> 7977.61s]  I wanted because now I have two shotgun crafting things. All right. I'll take it. I don't want I
[7977.61s -> 7985.62s]  got S's on every single one except the last three or the last two. You look flustered. No, I'm just
[7985.62s -> 8001.85s]  I'm just I just have a red. I just have blood in my face. All right. Does he sell gunpowder?
[8001.85s -> 8005.94s]  I want the case that drops more gunpowder. I think I might already even have it on.
[8006.10s -> 8025.32s]  Do I have the money one? Let's see. That's already on for gunpowder. So I have a 35% chance to get
[8025.32s -> 8036.60s]  more shotgun ammo, which is a big deal in the melee crit. Do you have anything? You have these.
[8047.93s -> 8062.58s]  I need square gems very badly. I have a question. Should I sell the bolt thrower now
[8063.14s -> 8069.74s]  and go all into the broken butterfly? It actually might be time to get rid of this
[8070.30s -> 8073.34s]  because I'm I don't I haven't upgraded in a while. I haven't spent the
[8074.14s -> 8081.90s]  the t-tas on it. So I do like it, but I kind of let it fall off a little bit, didn't I?
[8083.56s -> 8093.51s]  Yeah, I let it fall off. I'm going to sell it. It's going. It was fun. It's cool to
[8093.51s -> 8114.52s]  new addition, but I want the money now. Oh, yeah. Molding a weapon to suit your specific.
[8114.52s -> 8122.50s]  This kind of work is about finesse. Straight. Little bit goes a long way. Better to be over
[8122.50s -> 8135.48s]  prepared. Am I right? Don't always have this in stock. Where would it? Pleasant trap. OK,
[8136.58s -> 8152.79s]  I just need a bunch of gunpowder. This thing is empty. All right, we're good.
[8152.79s -> 8166.79s]  Let me load this up and gun is good. All right. Sell the other charms. Sell your charms.
[8170.15s -> 8175.83s]  Oh, these do sell for a lot. OK. Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. So
[8176.55s -> 8182.38s]  well, that's our choice to make. You can never hold more than one on anything anyway,
[8182.38s -> 8210.42s]  so just sell the copies. OK, this helps. I probably should upgrade this.
[8212.10s -> 8217.58s]  All the mines. Yeah, I can sell the mines too. Small key. Can I sell that? Why would I do that?
[8228.39s -> 8237.66s]  There are no more locks. Oh, shit. OK. A deal well struck. All right. This is going to make
[8237.66s -> 8246.20s]  this thing disgusting, but I really should level. I need to. I need to use this for a little while.
[8246.20s -> 8258.36s]  So we're going probably ammo capacity or probably power. I'm going to do power. I think
[8258.92s -> 8265.11s]  put it into the revolver. I'm going to make a lot more money soon. This is I need to use this
[8265.11s -> 8271.66s]  now. Sell this and just buy the rifle. What can I do? Can I afford the right? How much is the rifle?
[8272.30s -> 8275.42s]  Oh, it's only twelve thousand. All right. Wait, there's more than one rifle, isn't there?
[8277.06s -> 8282.50s]  In your pocket or your I guess it's fine. Yeah, that's a good idea. All right. I'm going to get
[8282.50s -> 8291.51s]  the rifle and I'm going to cancel because I need to sell that first anyway. Let me take the scope
[8291.51s -> 8305.50s]  off of it. Get yourself killed. Stingray is better. It is better. I need thirty thousand. All right.
[8305.90s -> 8320.62s]  Is what I've got. All right. We are good.
[8324.86s -> 8333.69s]  I am not taking the regular scope. I'm going to put on this. How does it look?
[8348.06s -> 8357.16s]  OK, very cool. We're good. Good strategy. I've got lots of good stuff. I am ready.
[8357.72s -> 8369.54s]  I'm able. Let's go. I'm ready to go. I am tuned up. Where's the tuned? I'm ready.
[8369.54s -> 8377.93s]  I am aware. I am a powerhouse. Welcome for a selection of good things on sale.
[8379.37s -> 8402.49s]  What's that? Suit yourself, stranger. Let's go. Be careful, Ashley.
[8407.11s -> 8412.34s]  Hmm. OK.
[8430.86s -> 8445.59s]  You got to see on your awareness report card. I want to kill this guy without
[8445.59s -> 8455.22s]  alerting everybody. That would be nice. Oh, there are five. All right. Remind me to do these.
[8465.06s -> 8499.16s]  What's going on? Why is he still moving? Shut up. What is it hitting?
[8499.24s -> 8526.17s]  Rumor said shut up right after I said sorry. What? I didn't tell you to shut up. OK, so there's one
[8526.17s -> 8562.36s]  behind me over here. Up here, I think. Where is it? Like that way. Go up. And what do you think he
[8562.36s -> 8576.55s]  smells like at this point? I smell just I just smell like a regular. I don't know. Got everything
[8576.55s -> 8583.51s]  down here, I think. No, his handgun bullets. Those are up, though. I don't think I can get those.
[8584.07s -> 8608.68s]  I have to get up there first. OK, that's better. Let's go. You look like you would smell like
[8608.68s -> 8616.18s]  everything bagel seasoning. That sounds actually kind of good. And I don't have what's the problem
[8616.18s -> 8656.34s]  there? Oh, shit. What's going on? I backed myself into such a corner here. Snap that guy right in
[8656.34s -> 8665.38s]  the throat. OK, what about her? Ashley. I didn't shoot Ashley. That's why I was swinging the knife
[8665.38s -> 8683.90s]  because I didn't want to hit her. I didn't want to shoot her. Really? No, I want square gems.
[8684.86s -> 8703.51s]  Those are not square gems. Very frustrating. Does not open. This does not open either. It does.
[8705.11s -> 8711.94s]  What the heck? They came from there. You know, BRB. Yeah, when I get to the end of this next
[8711.94s -> 8729.67s]  chapter, I will be our be. Come on. Yes. Beautiful. Perfect. Replenishing. Yes. Very good. We're up
[8729.67s -> 8755.10s]  28 shots now. That's a good thing. OK. Oh, actually, you do it. OK, that leads us back up here.
[8757.70s -> 8785.40s]  Damn it. Where are you? What are you doing? Get over here. Come on.
[8801.74s -> 8829.61s]  Oh, my God. It was so funny. Fuck. Fuck. I don't want to. She just got locked. Are you all right?
[8830.49s -> 8851.29s]  That was a crowbar in the head. Watch out. Everything is good. Please move out of the way.
[8854.92s -> 8863.34s]  All right. Now, this time I'm not going to screw this up. I got everything I did. All right. This
[8863.34s -> 8888.79s]  time. So what? I tell her to run. Yes. All right. Still got eight. Very good. Now, I'm going to do
[8888.79s -> 8897.99s]  this because that spawns a bunch of people, apparently. Like you do it. My problem was I
[8897.99s -> 8932.14s]  jumped out. I should have just walked. Where are they? Fuck. What am I doing wrong? What happened?
[8933.10s -> 8951.37s]  Wait. No, don't do this. Not right now. What the fuck did I just do? Damn it. I didn't even turn
[8951.37s -> 8966.82s]  around once. I followed that guy up the stairs the whole time. Are you all right? OK. Now do it again.
[8969.77s -> 8980.90s]  Is it just out? Wait, what? What was the point of doing all that? You can just go this way.
[8981.62s -> 9013.51s]  Oh, because I unlocked it because it was locked before. I get it. We're good. Back up. Back up.
[9013.51s -> 9022.28s]  This way. This way. Follow me. No, no, no. Come close. Oh, get off my face.
[9025.43s -> 9030.84s]  You just walked into that Ashley and it would not have. She literally just walked into it almost.
[9030.84s -> 9066.23s]  That's a lot of handgun ammo. Any reason to go down here? No. Oh, that isn't. Can you recap
[9066.23s -> 9071.77s]  every joke? I was asleep. Um, it was the peanut butter jelly. There was a soundtrack to that
[9071.77s -> 9079.54s]  crazy room. Then there was, um, that was probably it. You're up to speed now.
[9080.26s -> 9097.67s]  I need two more still. Come on. There's going to be like alligators or something in here, isn't
[9097.67s -> 9103.30s]  there? I don't remember. Yes. All right. I need one more of these and I got another 100k.
[9104.02s -> 9113.70s]  I need a red one, right? Oh, the Roblox birthday party. Yeah, that was a really funny joke. That
[9113.70s -> 9120.26s]  was a really good joke. That's right. That was a really good joke I was making. Exactly. I'm glad
[9120.26s -> 9123.38s]  that you all we all agree on that because that doesn't really have to happen because it was a
[9123.38s -> 9137.58s]  funny joke. Good. Very good. It's not a joke. Well, a lot of people just said it was. Ashley,
[9137.58s -> 9147.54s]  how did you mess that up? Wait. Oh, I messed it up at the same time. Yeah. Okay. I pressed spacebar,
[9147.54s -> 9209.59s]  not E. Wait here. I can hear it. I can hear it going. What the fuck are you talking about?
[9220.60s -> 9248.84s]  What? What the hell is going on here? Oh, nice. I got, um, I got a, I got a hundred thousand dollars
[9248.84s -> 9277.53s]  now. That's the upgraded regenerators. Yep. I forgot. Very scary. Get that lever. I pressed it.
[9277.53s -> 9285.94s]  Is there a delay? E. There's a delay. There's a delay. There's like a full second delay. I
[9285.94s -> 9335.94s]  didn't know that. Give me some space. Got it. I know there's another one. This thing has no power.
[9335.94s -> 9370.31s]  Get this for me. Why couldn't I just do it? Why didn't I just do it? You gotta be ready for an,
[9370.31s -> 9387.27s]  this is going to be like an attack or something. This is fully loaded, right? Yep.
[9387.27s -> 9406.63s]  Ooh, I have so many of these. I really have so many. Okay. Good. Keep going.
[9446.62s -> 9464.78s]  Power. Just checking. I don't want to miss anything. All right. Hold on.
[9464.78s -> 9480.73s]  Full heal. I need a few more of those. All right. Let's do it. I know, I know it's coming.
[9480.73s -> 9491.99s]  That opens. No, no, no. Don't use that. Don't use that. Don't use that. I gotta go. I gotta go. I
[9491.99s -> 9503.66s]  gotta go. Oh God. Oh shit. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[9503.66s -> 9520.81s]  I gotta go right now. Hurry up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. Oh,
[9521.77s -> 9539.10s]  stop doing that. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
[9539.74s -> 9558.12s]  What are you doing? Oh, you're going to turn to the thing. Where is it?
[9562.46s -> 9581.90s]  Ow. Jesus. Okay. Nice work. Very good. I missed a treasure, but what can you do?
[9581.90s -> 9635.51s]  What can you do? That's okay. What can you do? Nah, what can you do? Sounds like you're at the
[9635.51s -> 9650.38s]  grocery store. It kind of does, you know, but people are raging because I'm not taking like
[9650.38s -> 9671.46s]  40 minutes on each puzzle now. I had breakfast this morning. Again, I had yogurt. I already
[9671.46s -> 9678.36s]  told you I had yogurt. I had a piece of toast. I had a nice big glass of water. I almost lied
[9678.36s -> 9681.72s]  instead of orange juice for no reason. I don't know why you would lie about something so stupid.
[9681.72s -> 9705.77s]  Oh, rats. Oh, wait a minute. I don't think I got all these. I didn't. Okay.
[9705.93s -> 9723.54s]  What can I do? Let's do it. Here we go. We've got red, green, $100,000. Now this one can do this.
[9726.63s -> 9740.55s]  $27,000. This one started. Very good. This one cannot be started, but we're making a lot of
[9740.55s -> 9778.57s]  money now. $100,000. $27,000. Here it is. This thing now will be doing like 40 per shot.
[9778.57s -> 9796.52s]  It's a good idea. You don't even use it. When I press this button, it is now going to be on
[9796.52s -> 9802.60s]  my hot bar and it will be used at every major boss encounter going forward. I'm worried.
[9803.64s -> 9811.16s]  We're good. All right. In the meantime, I don't think I'm going to be able to get a ticket,
[9811.16s -> 9819.26s]  so I'm going for it. Do it. This thing is ridiculous.
[9837.94s -> 9846.60s]  Oh, I'm going to buy. You still have those dirt. No, you don't. Okay. Where is the
[9847.48s -> 9856.94s]  Magnum is already here. And how many shots do I have with this? I have 19 shots with this Magnum.
[9856.94s -> 9877.82s]  There's a better Magnum. That's fine. This can stay the way it is. You're going to miss 19 times.
[9877.82s -> 9888.42s]  Now that would be really funny, but I don't think so. I kept upgrading this just because
[9888.42s -> 9893.70s]  it's good to have handguns doing just fine. It's all maxed out. Shotgun is maxed out,
[9895.05s -> 9904.28s]  getting close 37 in one go. Okay. I think this is a major encounter. If let me just make sure
[9904.84s -> 9914.12s]  take a sip. So I got the strategy guide down here. So it says that down here, Leon will be
[9915.00s -> 9922.92s]  ambushed by four major enemy types. One chainsaw enemy, one regenerator, one question mark,
[9922.92s -> 9928.20s]  question mark, question mark, question mark. Guy doesn't even know. And one boss is what's down
[9928.20s -> 9932.94s]  here. So if I jumped down here, let me make sure you can see. Yeah. Right here. I want what the
[9932.94s -> 9944.02s]  question mark is. Why would they not say that in the guide? That's weird. My ear is really itchy.
[9959.74s -> 9969.67s]  That's a lift. You might be the only person that needs a maxed out broken butterfly on
[9969.67s -> 9975.14s]  standard difficulty. What do you, what would it say? I need this. I just think it's fun to do.
[9977.54s -> 9981.22s]  Well, wait, why do you think I'm like, I'm doing that? Cause I feel like I need to do that.
[9982.47s -> 9985.75s]  I don't need the broken butterfly. It's just a fun thing to upgrade.
[10029.91s -> 10039.11s]  Why would driver's ed make you able to drive a wrecking ball? All you did is piss the building
[10039.11s -> 10054.42s]  off. You just hit the building on the side and made it scream. What are you swinging at?
[10054.42s -> 10088.38s]  Where are you going? What is he talking about? Open the window. Oh my goodness. That's a lot of
[10088.38s -> 10114.06s]  shit. What's that? Oh shit. I just like watched him do that. Hey, God damn it. I tried to.
[10114.06s -> 10140.86s]  That guy just landed on his neck. There's too many things happening yet. Where is that little
[10140.86s -> 10185.06s]  bug? Shit. Actually break the wall. She is actually stop. Stop. We need to think of a different way.
[10190.30s -> 10223.51s]  I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh God. Oh God. What do you mean help? Oh my God. What is fucking happening?
[10224.31s -> 10268.47s]  Somebody is beating the shit out of me with a club and I don't fuck off. Nice. All right. Collect.
[10268.47s -> 10286.22s]  I think I got everything. Most things. There's a lot of money over here. Wait, there's a lot of
[10286.22s -> 10303.82s]  money. That was pretty cool. Actually. You ever feel like a plastic bag? Yeah, actually sometimes
[10304.38s -> 10323.30s]  I don't think I can get the other two. Get this one. Last one is all the way across here.
[10324.02s -> 10354.41s]  I wonder where. Down there. Maybe I can still get it. Okay, let's go. You could go back and get it.
[10354.41s -> 10362.76s]  No, I got everything upgraded. I'm good. Pretty much this is what I have for the end game anyways.
[10363.50s -> 10374.82s]  Maxed out shotgun. Maxed out handgun. Maxed out magnum. There's a shortcut right here. Wait,
[10374.82s -> 10393.58s]  really? You mean like you're here? Oh, yeah, you're right. Okay, so that's the shortcut to
[10393.58s -> 10402.68s]  get right here. So then with this map, there's bullets. Where are these bullets? Where are these
[10402.68s -> 10448.12s]  bullets? Where are these bullets? In the trash. I thought you meant like in a dumpster. Very cool.
[10448.12s -> 10458.47s]  Let's move on. There have been sightings of what appears to be a strange corpse wandering around,
[10458.47s -> 10490.62s]  likely the result of some immoral experiment in the incubation lab. Do it or coward. Do it.
[10492.52s -> 10496.92s]  Do it. Do it. It's with the regenerators. Do it. Do it. It's going to be an omega regenerator.
[10496.92s -> 10516.28s]  It's my least favorite enemy in the game. All right. Fine. We're at the end anyways. Yeah,
[10516.28s -> 10524.02s]  that's right. It's true. I really don't want to go back here and do this, but I'm going to.
[10531.59s -> 10556.50s]  It is. Emerald can go in here now. Very good. All right. Down in the incubation lab,
[10556.50s -> 10562.09s]  straight through here, left, left. I need to save it first. I don't want to. I'm going to
[10562.09s -> 10574.04s]  blow through all my ammo. It's going to be a disaster. Have you seen One Piece? I've seen
[10574.04s -> 10579.93s]  random episodes of One Piece, but I don't. I haven't really cared to sit down and watch that
[10579.93s -> 10587.03s]  much of it. I've just seen random episodes on TV, just like scrolling around. My problem with One
[10587.03s -> 10593.19s]  Piece is isn't it still not done? And it's the manga has been going for like 30 years and there's
[10593.19s -> 10608.98s]  like 1500 volumes. It's like, where do I even start with that? Only five more years. Hey,
[10608.98s -> 10616.46s]  I'll tell you though, that's kind of lifelong media, isn't it? If you were a fan of One Piece,
[10617.02s -> 10623.50s]  10 plus years ago, you still get to enjoy it. It's still going. You still get to enjoy. Is
[10623.50s -> 10626.70s]  there going to be a thing you can kind of pay attention to sometimes? That's kind of cool.
[10627.50s -> 10663.72s]  Yeah, that thing's not dead. It is. Oh my God. This thing. Look at how many things. Stop doing
[10663.72s -> 10693.06s]  that. One more, one more, one more in the head. Ooh, that's it. Right. Nice. This is a bad idea,
[10693.06s -> 10716.26s]  but I'm gonna do it. I don't care. Ruby. I just wanted the Ruby. You're wasting ammo. I'm all
[10716.26s -> 10728.28s]  right. All right. That's all right. I got a Ruby. Kill the others. All this. Okay. I think I can
[10728.28s -> 10757.32s]  handle this. Ready? What the fuck? Die. All right. It was worth it. It was worth it. It was worth it.
[10759.21s -> 10768.98s]  I got two gems for that. It's fine. I'm good. Dude, the shotgun. I shoot like three times in
[10768.98s -> 10777.42s]  that area and it doesn't even kill the parasite. It's a lot of dog shit. All right. Let's get back
[10777.42s -> 10810.33s]  here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's the, there's that back over here and then bang a left
[10814.34s -> 10817.30s]  up ladder. No, no, no, no. It's just right through.
[10824.31s -> 10831.27s]  Nice work. Got a selection of good things on sale. What should I even get at this point?
[10831.27s -> 10841.93s]  Velvet blues. Money. This is limitless. I could just get a ton of these.
[10845.16s -> 10857.58s]  One each to do. I don't really care about this anymore. All the velvet blues are that's going
[10857.58s -> 10867.70s]  to give me like 20, like at least grab the ticket. Nah. Get the funny scope. Nah. Punisher. Nah.
[10867.70s -> 10876.47s]  I'm just going to buy a shitload of these. Sell them. I'll get the map and then I'll get a bunch
[10876.47s -> 10912.60s]  of these. Hell yeah. Very good. 46k. Am I at the point where I should just start selling the gems
[10912.68s -> 10928.47s]  because I didn't find the other items? Not yet. This is good. All right. I do want to buy,
[10929.83s -> 10933.90s]  I should probably get this. That's the last upgrade for the case.
[10938.10s -> 10941.94s]  Then we're going to do, I don't know, maybe just just do power. Maybe
[10941.94s -> 10947.58s]  tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill. Yeah. Just do power.
[10954.50s -> 10961.64s]  All right. Looking good. I need rifle ammo, but I think I can craft it actually.
[10961.64s -> 11010.95s]  I can. No, don't do that yet. Now I'll do it. Your body armor. I just upgraded it.
[11012.07s -> 11026.60s]  It's already broken already. I am molding. Sorry. All right. Let's go. Whoa.
[11027.64s -> 11076.79s]  Oh, it added it to the map, but where is it? Nice. Wait, I could do too. Okay. That's fun.
[11076.79s -> 11115.67s]  Let's go. No more stalling. First, we have to make it out of here.
[11119.08s -> 11130.17s]  I did not want to press the fucking button again. I wanted to press W,
[11130.73s -> 11139.77s]  but I went in the middle of the key. I didn't. I pressed E instead of W because I just have never
[11139.77s -> 11143.93s]  learned where they are because if you have a keyboard, it's just spread out and I can't even.
[11144.57s -> 11152.41s]  It's just my fingers try to find E and it's, there's a big space here and I just mushed in the
[11152.41s -> 11196.12s]  middle. I'm going to get my mesh keyboard back. Nothing in here. Yes, there is.
[11197.75s -> 11208.58s]  One of the things they say in the original, they go, and the music goes,
[11211.30s -> 11226.87s]  I must stress the use of extreme caution when handling the amber deposits from underneath
[11226.87s -> 11232.30s]  the castle. Work with the utmost respect and obedience. It is imperative that you do not
[11232.30s -> 11252.92s]  disturb the holy body's slumber. Treasures in here. This must be what Luis was talking about.
[11252.92s -> 11278.04s]  You. Damn, that thing's probably worth a lot. Nice. Crystal ore.
[11280.30s -> 11285.58s]  Dearest Lord Saddler, I am overjoyed to report wonderful news. Production of the superior species
[11285.58s -> 11291.54s]  of Las Plagas is officially underway. If all goes accordingly, rest assured that we will reach our
[11291.54s -> 11296.74s]  ultimate goal. The Plaga is a truly magnificent organism that has the capacity to live in any
[11296.74s -> 11303.67s]  vertebrae, be it human, dog, or even crow. There is no other parasite like it on earth. The superior
[11303.67s -> 11309.59s]  species is particularly impressive as it can assimilate with a host without causing any damage
[11309.59s -> 11315.13s]  to the brain. No one can oppose the strength of your dominance, my Lord. On the contrary,
[11315.13s -> 11320.33s]  who would resist once they experience the utter joy that accompanies the absence of free will?
[11320.33s -> 11324.94s]  I'm living proof how ignorant I once was. In a few days, I will have finished
[11324.94s -> 11331.37s]  administrating the Plaga to all the high-ranking researchers, and then they too shall know. And
[11331.37s -> 11355.38s]  when your plan is complete, the whole world shall know. The head researcher. Project. Don't touch
[11355.38s -> 11361.54s]  that.
[11403.69s -> 11415.86s]  Obey. Obey the voice of our Lord. I feel like, uh, uh-oh.
[11430.14s -> 11436.15s]  Thank God she's a really bad shot with this. Or she's a really good shot.
[11436.15s -> 11456.68s]  I can see this. My faithful disciple shall deliver to you your pennies. Now, child,
[11456.68s -> 11463.62s]  you need not be afraid. Submit your body and release yourself from fear.
[11464.50s -> 11477.00s]  Hell's Kitchen. Stop ruining cutscenes.
[11477.72s -> 11515.54s]  Okay. I got everything in here, didn't I? Yes, I did. Let's go.
[11523.91s -> 11535.00s]  All right. I have enough loaded, don't I? Which way does this go?
[11535.00s -> 11553.13s]  It can go both ways, but I'll go this way first. Good.
[11553.13s -> 11569.75s]  For your request, redevelopment of the island is well underway. Weapons and other defensive
[11569.75s -> 11574.12s]  equipment have been set to guard against any outside intruders. By the time we are finished,
[11574.12s -> 11579.35s]  the island will be a giant fortress. Very cool. These defenses won't hold up long term,
[11579.35s -> 11606.54s]  but they should last until we carry out our plan. Where is this thing?
[11607.42s -> 11619.61s]  I wonder how many of those I actually missed. Probably a few at this point, right?
[11620.25s -> 11644.62s]  He didn't even see me. Stop. There's one per chapter. Huh. So I, yeah, so I missed a few.
[11644.62s -> 11670.65s]  That's good to know for future playthroughs, though. So we'll see. 14k.
[11670.65s -> 11674.33s]  I don't really need money for anything else besides a sniper rifle. I'm just gonna make
[11674.33s -> 11704.09s]  sure I have enough going forward. When is BRB? Very soon. Want me to read it? Want me to read it?
[11704.17s -> 11709.80s]  No. Yes. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. All right, we'll do the TLDR.
[11710.74s -> 11713.46s]  Few people have heard of the name, even within the highest ranks of the U.S. Government. In
[11713.46s -> 11724.28s]  little wonder, too, the operation was not made public. Operation Javier? Started back in 2002.
[11724.84s -> 11733.18s]  I don't know if the mission was a failure. It shouldn't have been difficult to extract a single
[11733.18s -> 11738.07s]  stranded unit. Why did it take so long? The U.S. Government let those people die,
[11738.07s -> 11740.87s]  brave young people who dedicated their lives to protect the country.
[11740.87s -> 11746.42s]  And I want to expose this crime. Operation Javier was written by an American journalist.
[11746.90s -> 11757.43s]  I don't know if Jeremy doesn't read comments like, you've got a nice sheen today. I just did.
[11758.07s -> 11827.77s]  That's me. Oh, no, it's Saw. He made a Saw trap for me. Hello again, Leon. Come on. So annoying.
[11827.77s -> 11835.70s]  So annoying. It's so annoying. I haven't sneezed in like nine days. And every time I'm about to,
[11835.70s -> 11841.91s]  when I want to do a stupid thing I want to do, it just stops. And I can usually look at the light.
[11841.91s -> 11846.07s]  But the light's not on. The lights are off. So I have to look at the big ring light in the corner
[11846.07s -> 11855.86s]  and it doesn't work. Usually I can go like this, bang, and hit the overhead light right here,
[11855.86s -> 11862.33s]  but it's off. So there's one light over in the corner that doesn't work. All right, we're good.
[11862.89s -> 11870.89s]  Let's go. I can read this. Phase one, depart from campus with the target.
[11870.89s -> 11875.94s]  Escort the target as usual until the start of phase two. There should be three others inside
[11875.94s -> 11880.47s]  the vehicle, including Baker. Able's unit will follow behind you in a separate vehicle.
[11880.47s -> 11886.33s]  Continue to drive at your normal route. Stop the vehicle under the pretense of engine trouble.
[11886.33s -> 11891.53s]  Transfer the target to Able's vehicle. Able's unit will change course. Subdue and restrain the
[11891.53s -> 11896.60s]  target. Place the target in a large container. Baker's unit will create a diversion. Henry's
[11896.60s -> 11902.82s]  unit will infiltrate the investigation's database and disable the network. Meet at point K9 and
[11902.82s -> 11910.02s]  transfer the cargo. What are they talking about? What does that mean? What are they talking about?
[11910.02s -> 11944.09s]  There's a treasure here. A large gold bar. Okay. Nice. Get out of here. This game is so good.
[11944.81s -> 11957.70s]  This game is so fun. Look alive. Is there really something in there?
[11965.19s -> 11969.75s]  That must be so weird. Imagine you're just hanging out waiting for me at some point.
[11969.75s -> 11974.20s]  You don't know when I'm going to show up. And then this is how I appear.
[11974.76s -> 11982.71s]  I just would scare the shit out of me. This would be terrifying. That would be so scary.
[11991.78s -> 12012.97s]  Welcome. What can I do you for? That's good work if I do say so myself. Reload speed probably. Yeah.
[12013.61s -> 12022.81s]  Try that on for size. See how that feels mate. A fellow like yourself should notice the difference
[12022.81s -> 12033.85s]  right away. Okay. Will that be all then? Pleasant travel. Are we enjoying the game? Yes. Very much
[12033.85s -> 12041.51s]  so. We're almost at the end as well. We only got probably like what? An hour or two? I think this
[12041.51s -> 12063.37s]  is the end of the chapter coming up here. Okay. Oh wait. I remember this part. This part was weird.
[12065.61s -> 12070.57s]  The ruins. Oh yeah. I forgot about the ruins. It was a little more sandy in the old one.
[12070.57s -> 12097.77s]  You always had poor judgment. But if you think I'm going to let you out of here alive,
[12097.77s -> 12105.96s]  you're even more naive than I thought. You can't save her. You can't save anyone. Give it up,
[12105.96s -> 12110.76s]  Krauser. Had enough. Being a lackey for these maniacs won't bring your men back.
[12112.12s -> 12119.32s]  And what the hell for? Revenge on the government? You think they would want that? Revenge.
[12120.20s -> 12127.08s]  You think I'm doing all this for revenge? Isn't that what this is all about? See,
[12127.96s -> 12135.66s]  in that jungle I had a revelation. The most important thing in this world is pure
[12136.38s -> 12144.14s]  unadulterated power. Giving me that. You know you were always an asshole.
[12144.94s -> 12155.66s]  But at least you had some kind of code. Some honor. Look at you now. Enough reminiscing.
[12157.61s -> 12159.77s]  Move out and draw fire, soldier.
[12169.46s -> 12175.99s]  Squibs didn't go off, Krauser. I just turned him into Super Mario.
[12201.38s -> 12230.65s]  Drop it. What's that mean? Remember the basics of CQC? Yeah.
[12282.14s -> 12301.13s]  Stop talking out loud, Leon. He's laid this place out with traps. I better be careful. I
[12301.21s -> 12325.42s]  probably shouldn't walk into the red laser right here in front of me. Can I turn this off if I get
[12325.42s -> 12349.48s]  close enough? What is that? What's going on? What's that sound? Oh, I got it. Did I get it?
[12350.20s -> 12385.77s]  I got it. Oh, nice. Sentry down. That's a pretty good one.
[12399.61s -> 12447.34s]  Sorry. Slowly filling this back up. Slowly filling it back up.
[12447.42s -> 12458.95s]  I'd be dead if I kept listening to people like you.
[12469.10s -> 12473.91s]  That also means the Reaper is coming for you. Don't talk over me during my big moment.
[12473.91s -> 12476.79s]  The Reaper is coming for you too then. Doesn't that mean it's coming for us all?
[12476.79s -> 12480.46s]  It's coming for you too? That would have been way cooler.
[12501.66s -> 12505.18s]  Chefs, four of you are going to make it through the next round.
[12505.90s -> 12511.69s]  Only two of you will do this next challenge. Before you is a sacred ingredient.
[12512.57s -> 12523.82s]  All right. I don't want to get killed. Didn't even hurt.
[12538.23s -> 12540.65s]  What was that?
[12565.61s -> 12576.78s]  Oh, I got them all. He's going to run into this.
[12577.50s -> 12591.50s]  We're done here, Krauser. Again. Time for the Las Lagas.
[12609.48s -> 12616.18s]  That's the difference between you and me, Loki.
[12616.18s -> 12617.62s]  It's like Nightmare from Soul Calibur.
[12618.42s -> 12653.58s]  Yeah. Can I get time out for a minute? I'm crafting.
[12681.00s -> 12683.72s]  Reload it. Hold on, Krauser. Let me reload every single gun.
[12683.88s -> 12731.94s]  I just pissed him off so bad. Hey, guys. We're back.
[12733.48s -> 12756.41s]  Get all this ammo now. I'm getting kind of stacked here.
[12756.41s -> 12767.53s]  There are slugs. I got all 48 are loaded. I got 50. Look, I have 51.
[12782.49s -> 12788.52s]  Here we go.
[12790.52s -> 12791.88s]  Time for the teacher to be taught.
[12810.36s -> 12827.45s]  Okay, I'm fine. Oh, shit. He's kind of fast.
[12828.09s -> 12867.29s]  Look at my head. What the fuck am I doing?
[12878.76s -> 12884.07s]  Tab didn't open the inventory. It was stuck. I pressed Tab.
[12910.06s -> 12923.99s]  Stop hitting me. It's annoying. What the fuck am I doing?
[12931.08s -> 12959.43s]  Get out of here. 50 slugs, Stephen. He loves the cheese shotgun.
[12959.99s -> 12964.79s]  Well, I put almost $400,000 into this. I'm going to use it on the bosses.
[12965.35s -> 12970.84s]  And then if I run out of ammo, I have 20 shots with the fully upgraded butterfly
[12970.84s -> 12972.68s]  at the end of the game and I can kill the boss in like three hits.
[13039.32s -> 13047.16s]  Almost lost it there. I think there's some other items to get.
[13047.16s -> 13070.86s]  The new knife is sick. I bet it is. And we still have plenty of shotgun shots.
[13070.86s -> 13075.61s]  Wait, there's no time to escape, somebody said.
[13075.61s -> 13091.22s]  Yeah, doesn't that happen? Did they take that out?
[13091.22s -> 13100.47s]  Hmm, interesting. There's a couple of very decent changes in the remake.
[13100.47s -> 13112.92s]  Is it on professional? Oh, that's not the last boss.
[13112.92s -> 13116.14s]  But I feel like doesn't it? I'm just remembering it wrong.
[13116.14s -> 13128.23s]  They removed the underground huge monster. 14 beat Jack Krauser.
[13128.23s -> 13131.66s]  Killed two parasites inside a regenerator with a single bullet.
[13132.22s -> 13137.37s]  Destroyed five targets at the shooting range with one shot.
[13137.37s -> 13147.91s]  Cool. All right, we're going to take a quick break.
[13147.91s -> 13149.83s]  I have not gone to the bathroom. I'm going to go pee.
[13149.83s -> 13154.66s]  I'm going to get some more water and we will be back in a minute or two.
[13154.66s -> 13616.15s]  See you in a sec. Hey, how's it going?
[13616.15s -> 13622.70s]  Scared you? Didn't mean to.
[13623.26s -> 13627.42s]  All right, let's get to the end game. There's only one.
[13628.06s -> 13641.21s]  I think the last chapter is very short. Let's go for it.
[13641.21s -> 13644.49s]  We got one more after this, but I think it's a pretty short one.
[13644.49s -> 13647.70s]  So this is probably going to be another maybe a couple hours.
[13648.42s -> 13653.58s]  I am not going to rush through this because this is a great game.
[13653.58s -> 13658.30s]  I love this game and I don't want to just run through.
[13658.30s -> 13660.14s]  But we are at the final arc.
[13678.26s -> 13681.29s]  You're going to finish this tonight? Yes.
[13681.29s -> 13688.60s]  That's got to be their sanctuary.
[13688.60s -> 13690.12s]  I will finish the game tonight.
[13690.12s -> 13692.23s]  Ashley.
[13692.23s -> 13707.93s]  Okay. I feel like I got to move in a little more.
[13708.49s -> 13710.26s]  I feel like I'm too far away from everything.
[13710.90s -> 13717.50s]  That's better. Okay, good.
[13717.50s -> 13726.30s]  Let's go. Wait, I just don't.
[13728.23s -> 13729.19s]  When's the boss fight?
[13729.19s -> 13731.99s]  Take a look. Something's bound to catch your eye.
[13732.79s -> 13733.67s]  I just did one, man.
[13734.95s -> 13739.88s]  Well caught a selection of good things on sale, stranger.
[13740.70s -> 13744.14s]  A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skin.
[13744.14s -> 13751.00s]  You could probably play through most of the game with the knife.
[13751.00s -> 13752.44s]  So this is the better knife.
[13753.00s -> 13754.36s]  Should I sell the other one?
[13754.36s -> 13761.26s]  Should I sell the combat knife?
[13761.26s -> 13763.82s]  Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference.
[13763.82s -> 13767.74s]  The price? Well, that's our choice to make.
[13767.74s -> 13771.19s]  Why not? Just upgrade the other one.
[13775.67s -> 13776.55s]  You could keep both.
[13777.19s -> 13780.20s]  Also when this one's done, I can go to this one.
[13781.30s -> 13782.26s]  Oh, so I'm going to have to...
[13783.38s -> 13787.11s]  Well, then I guess I will tune it up or not.
[13788.82s -> 13789.78s]  I'm going to stick with the plan.
[13794.50s -> 13795.30s]  I'm going to stick with the plan.
[13796.23s -> 13796.87s]  That's cool, though.
[13798.78s -> 13800.30s]  40% off. Damn.
[13801.42s -> 13802.70s]  I'm not going to use it anyways.
[13804.73s -> 13807.66s]  I've already got my setup.
[13811.56s -> 13812.60s]  Is it equipped?
[13812.60s -> 13815.56s]  It's not equipped, but I'll equip it after.
[13824.97s -> 13825.85s]  Buy resources?
[13827.85s -> 13829.45s]  Did he fill the shop up with resources?
[13832.62s -> 13833.50s]  Oh, he did. Okay.
[13836.30s -> 13853.30s]  Don't get yourself killed now.
[13853.30s -> 13865.61s]  Okay. Save it again.
[13865.61s -> 13867.29s]  I would be so bad with the save shit.
[13867.29s -> 13869.77s]  I just... I'm such a compulsive saver.
[13885.02s -> 13894.73s]  Whoa. Oh, he almost hit your friend.
[13914.89s -> 13926.41s]  Imagine him. Back up.
[13935.98s -> 13944.70s]  You got it. Nice shooting.
[13955.75s -> 13958.70s]  Shoot him. Shoot these guys.
[13967.14s -> 13969.64s]  I got to keep moving. Treasure.
[13969.64s -> 13990.46s]  Where's the treasure? Back here.
[13990.46s -> 13992.06s]  I mean, I'm farming right now.
[13992.06s -> 13993.50s]  This actually is kind of cool.
[13993.50s -> 13994.22s]  I can just farm.
[13994.86s -> 14009.21s]  All right. I'm done. I'm done.
[14021.78s -> 14038.50s]  Thank you. Nice work.
[14038.50s -> 14075.70s]  All right. Get them. Nice. Good work.
[14090.34s -> 14092.34s]  Stop. You're shooting at me right now.
[14092.34s -> 14135.56s]  Treasures. I got you.
[14135.56s -> 14159.51s]  Where are you pissing? Where do I go?
[14178.68s -> 14200.76s]  What are you talking about?
[14200.76s -> 14202.84s]  Oh, my God. You're shooting me.
[14216.31s -> 14224.50s]  Wait. Oh, it's... Dude, stop.
[14225.06s -> 14249.16s]  Put it down.
[14272.31s -> 14274.23s]  Like, what is even happening right now?
[14274.23s -> 14276.79s]  Like, dude, I fucking shot the guy like eight times.
[14277.11s -> 14296.18s]  He's just so close.
[14297.14s -> 14299.78s]  Whatever. And horse shit.
[14306.46s -> 14308.22s]  All right. Okay. All right.
[14310.73s -> 14319.53s]  You're going to shoot that shit, isn't it?
[14319.53s -> 14321.93s]  I can't right now. Man.
[14324.22s -> 14333.53s]  You know what? Get the fuck away from me, all of you.
[14356.73s -> 14359.67s]  Okay. Where... Are there people on those?
[14365.42s -> 14365.92s]  Stop it.
[14414.66s -> 14416.42s]  How do I get up there?
[14416.42s -> 14421.10s]  I have to go down?
[14421.10s -> 14422.71s]  Well, there's a bunch of shit in here.
[14423.35s -> 14428.01s]  That's the shortcut.
[14428.65s -> 14431.98s]  I don't know, dude. You're the expert.
[14431.98s -> 14433.42s]  I haven't played this game in 10 years.
[14435.21s -> 14437.34s]  I... Do I go down?
[14449.72s -> 14454.44s]  Okay. All right. Now, where can I go?
[14454.44s -> 14467.70s]  Up? Can I do it with a grenade?
[14468.70s -> 14469.34s]  I don't think so.
[14470.33s -> 14471.61s]  I think I gotta go all the way.
[14471.61s -> 14474.23s]  I think it's a scripted thing.
[14474.23s -> 14475.59s]  Throw grenades at it? No, I'm good.
[14475.59s -> 14476.39s]  I'm just gonna go this way.
[14507.42s -> 14516.15s]  Okay. You piece of shit.
[14522.95s -> 14523.45s]  I'm all right.
[14575.10s -> 14577.94s]  All right. We did it. Nice job.
[14577.94s -> 14594.71s]  Now what? Jump down? Now what?
[14594.71s -> 14597.35s]  You're gonna blow something up for me?
[14597.35s -> 14606.94s]  You're gonna blow this up?
[14606.94s -> 14611.62s]  There we go.
[14611.62s -> 14615.70s]  Did you even tweet?
[14615.70s -> 14627.58s]  Oh, probably not.
[14627.58s -> 14628.38s]  Out of ammo?
[14661.50s -> 14662.86s]  You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
[14662.86s -> 14663.50s]  The guy hit me.
[14663.50s -> 14665.50s]  He got triple tapped me in a melee.
[14665.50s -> 14669.37s]  They don't even swing that much.
[14669.37s -> 14671.93s]  They literally don't even swing more than three times.
[14671.93s -> 14672.49s]  More than two.
[14672.49s -> 14673.69s]  I'm... Good thing I saved it.
[14688.17s -> 14690.25s]  It pisses me off when they do the little juke.
[14690.97s -> 14695.43s]  I'm so angry about that.
[14696.31s -> 14697.24s]  They do the...
[14699.70s -> 14700.50s]  Just reload. Just kill me.
[14700.50s -> 14701.78s]  Reload. Just reload. Reload.
[14701.78s -> 14702.26s]  Just hit me.
[14702.82s -> 14704.18s]  Just reload it. Reload it. Reload it.
[14704.18s -> 14704.74s]  This is stupid.
[14708.92s -> 14710.28s]  Holy shit, dude.
[14715.86s -> 14716.98s]  Stop overreacting?
[14718.25s -> 14719.13s]  I'm not.
[14719.13s -> 14724.68s]  This is just fucking mayhem every five seconds.
[14725.32s -> 14736.07s]  Oh my god.
[14736.87s -> 14742.02s]  This is just fucking mayhem.
[14742.90s -> 14745.24s]  They don't even know what they're attacking.
[14745.24s -> 14747.16s]  They're just shooting at random people.
[14749.06s -> 14749.86s]  Look at this.
[14749.86s -> 14750.82s]  I can't even run.
[14773.67s -> 14778.98s]  Okay. Yeah.
[14779.94s -> 14781.30s]  Yeah. Good. Nice job.
[14782.18s -> 14782.66s]  Fuck you.
[14783.46s -> 14798.84s]  What are you all doing?
[14798.84s -> 14799.88s]  You weren't even near me.
[14800.44s -> 14801.64s]  Literally nobody was here.
[14802.36s -> 14855.06s]  I have a sniper rifle.
[14855.06s -> 14855.70s]  Are you dumb?
[14856.26s -> 14869.98s]  I just spent 15 hours in game without a sniper rifle.
[14869.98s -> 14872.86s]  So now I have one magically and my brain is just like, no, you don't.
[14873.50s -> 14874.06s]  All right. Let's go.
[14874.70s -> 14875.74s]  Anything else I need to do here?
[14878.52s -> 14879.56s]  I don't think so.
[14880.28s -> 14881.24s]  I have to put these...
[14881.24s -> 14882.52s]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Here we go.
[14883.32s -> 14899.62s]  Don't even think about it.
[14900.18s -> 14901.54s]  Don't even think about it.
[14902.10s -> 14905.99s]  Don't even think about it.
[14905.99s -> 14927.35s]  It's the best way to get over there.
[14927.91s -> 14934.87s]  Oh, God is one of those things.
[14934.87s -> 14936.10s]  What's wrong with me?
[14936.74s -> 14938.73s]  What is wrong with my character?
[14938.73s -> 14939.13s]  Why is he...
[14939.13s -> 14940.57s]  Why am I limping like this?
[14941.21s -> 14943.29s]  Why am I limping?
[14955.34s -> 14980.52s]  Whoa. All right.
[14980.52s -> 14981.72s]  How do I get over there?
[14981.72s -> 14989.32s]  Through this building.
[14989.32s -> 14990.20s]  Okay. Through here.
[14991.86s -> 14992.34s]  This way.
[14992.98s -> 15008.95s]  And then...
[15008.95s -> 15009.91s]  Wait. How do I get in there?
[15010.71s -> 15015.10s]  Can I press the...
[15015.10s -> 15016.14s]  Is there an elevator I can press?
[15019.38s -> 15020.18s]  I can't go in there.
[15020.18s -> 15044.10s]  Hold on. There.
[15044.10s -> 15045.06s]  All right. Let's go.
[15045.06s -> 15053.64s]  Imagine being in this orchestra.
[15053.64s -> 15056.04s]  This is a killing zombie soundtrack.
[15056.04s -> 15060.82s]  Really? That'd be kind of cool.
[15060.82s -> 15068.44s]  Anybody? No. Let's go.
[15068.44s -> 15069.72s]  There's probably treasures and shit here,
[15069.72s -> 15071.56s]  but anytime this music plays like this,
[15071.56s -> 15072.44s]  I just have to run.
[15073.08s -> 15074.92s]  This is just panic music.
[15075.64s -> 15077.62s]  Remember when I used to turn off the music
[15077.62s -> 15078.82s]  for Dark Souls bosses and win?
[15080.57s -> 15081.21s]  Same scenario.
[15120.47s -> 15138.82s]  He's all right.
[15138.82s -> 15139.30s]  He's okay.
[15140.18s -> 15140.82s]  He's all right.
[15141.54s -> 15154.33s]  This is new.
[15154.97s -> 15157.00s]  I think this actually is new.
[15157.56s -> 15163.69s]  Hey, this is new.
[15174.70s -> 15175.26s]  In the old one,
[15175.26s -> 15178.06s]  he doesn't use his arm and go through the windshield.
[15178.62s -> 15190.23s]  Oh, it's a rocket launcher.
[15190.23s -> 15191.85s]  Right. Interesting.
[15191.85s -> 15193.72s]  Okay. It was a rocket.
[15193.72s -> 15194.60s]  Right, right, right, right.
[15201.08s -> 15211.82s]  Ooh. Let's check up here first.
[15211.82s -> 15215.96s]  Honestly, that makes a bit more sense,
[15215.96s -> 15217.00s]  but whatever.
[15217.00s -> 15224.52s]  I got a lot of money.
[15224.52s -> 15225.72s]  Is there anything else I want to do
[15226.36s -> 15230.06s]  before I get to the very end here?
[15236.36s -> 15238.44s]  Make sure you shoot this medallion here.
[15238.44s -> 15242.31s]  Oh shit. I can't even see it.
[15242.31s -> 15261.51s]  Okay. Blue medallions.
[15261.51s -> 15262.31s]  Any more here?
[15262.31s -> 15266.52s]  Looks like there's another...
[15266.52s -> 15269.05s]  I think I have to get them all right now.
[15269.69s -> 15296.20s]  Get in the water?
[15296.20s -> 15305.14s]  It's below me.
[15305.14s -> 15307.90s]  It's below me.
[15307.90s -> 15310.04s]  Okay. What about this one?
[15310.04s -> 15314.62s]  There's one up here.
[15314.62s -> 15319.21s]  What's the best way to go up there?
[15319.21s -> 15320.70s]  I don't know.
[15320.70s -> 15328.34s]  Below me.
[15331.77s -> 15332.41s]  Below me.
[15334.07s -> 15334.55s]  Whatever.
[15335.11s -> 15353.40s]  I don't know where it is.
[15353.40s -> 15357.18s]  I don't really care about the spinals anymore anyways.
[15357.18s -> 15370.44s]  Down in here somewhere?
[15370.44s -> 15375.59s]  What is this?
[15375.59s -> 15382.98s]  Ooh. Staff of royalty.
[15383.54s -> 15387.18s]  Very cool.
[15387.18s -> 15387.98s]  Nice.
[15387.98s -> 15392.55s]  That's probably worth a lot.
[15392.55s -> 15397.18s]  Okay. This is in here somewhere.
[15397.18s -> 15403.32s]  No, it's not.
[15403.32s -> 15405.42s]  I don't even care. I'm leaving.
[15405.42s -> 15418.44s]  You just have to give up and then you'll find it.
[15418.44s -> 15419.40s]  This one is...
[15419.40s -> 15419.96s]  I wonder if I can...
[15419.96s -> 15420.44s]  No, wait, wait.
[15420.44s -> 15421.00s]  I think I can...
[15421.08s -> 15423.88s]  Can I lean out the edge here and get this one if I go out here?
[15423.88s -> 15426.94s]  I think if I go down here and look that way?
[15426.94s -> 15478.33s]  Finished.
[15478.33s -> 15479.45s]  Is your cosplay is Leon?
[15479.45s -> 15480.73s]  We talked about it the other day.
[15480.73s -> 15485.75s]  I'll do it on your birthday.
[15485.75s -> 15508.90s]  Who's birthday?
[15510.01s -> 15511.13s]  Whoever's birthday is...
[15514.14s -> 15516.63s]  Never mind.
[15516.63s -> 15517.51s]  I'll take it back.
[15517.51s -> 15523.27s]  The repairs were completed without issue
[15523.27s -> 15526.39s]  since the facility was previously used for confinement.
[15526.39s -> 15531.27s]  The work required to reinforce the airtight ceiling was minimal.
[15531.27s -> 15534.39s]  As long as we don't run into any issues with the cooling system test,
[15534.39s -> 15537.99s]  we plan to bring in all the remaining specimens from Facility 1.
[15537.99s -> 15548.14s]  We changed my title.
[15548.14s -> 15550.70s]  All specimens were successfully transferred.
[15550.70s -> 15553.26s]  However, we experienced a slight hiccup during transport
[15553.26s -> 15555.16s]  as one of them became violent.
[15555.16s -> 15558.95s]  Luckily, the number of casualties was less than anticipated.
[15558.95s -> 15561.77s]  Please be extra careful when dealing with them.
[15561.77s -> 15563.77s]  We have received reports that they are beginning to acquire
[15563.77s -> 15565.85s]  a tolerance for the low temperatures.
[15565.85s -> 15577.74s]  I think I can make some gear now.
[15589.67s -> 15590.71s]  Loading back up.
[15590.71s -> 15593.94s]  This doesn't open.
[15593.94s -> 15594.18s]  I...
[15594.18s -> 15597.94s]  Oh, I hear a thingy.
[15604.87s -> 15605.99s]  Splendid bangle.
[15613.82s -> 15621.83s]  Okay.
[15621.83s -> 15623.69s]  These are gonna open, aren't they?
[15627.82s -> 15628.46s]  Oh, quick!
[15629.10s -> 15638.98s]  So I'm gonna jump out of one of these.
[15638.98s -> 15639.46s]  I know what...
[15642.30s -> 15642.86s]  What was that?
[15654.54s -> 15655.66s]  What the fuck?
[15674.90s -> 15675.22s]  Oh!
[15680.38s -> 15681.42s]  No, you're on the ground.
[15681.42s -> 15682.30s]  That's so annoying.
[15741.83s -> 15743.11s]  Homer Simpson?
[15743.11s -> 15747.02s]  Maybe a little.
[15747.02s -> 15762.23s]  Nice.
[15773.82s -> 15774.06s]  Eight.
[15776.06s -> 15777.58s]  I think it's just all money at this point.
[15778.30s -> 15780.15s]  What's that face?
[15783.26s -> 15784.30s]  What's that face?
[15784.30s -> 15785.90s]  I think I'm just going full on money.
[15786.54s -> 15789.14s]  Yeah, we're just doing money.
[15789.14s -> 15789.54s]  Let's go.
[15799.34s -> 15800.22s]  25k.
[15800.22s -> 15800.70s]  Hell yeah.
[15801.42s -> 15803.37s]  25k again.
[15806.89s -> 15808.17s]  Ooh, if I can do that.
[15813.58s -> 15821.70s]  Let's go.
[15822.34s -> 15824.22s]  I have so many...
[15824.22s -> 15825.82s]  There might be time just to start selling everything.
[15829.50s -> 15830.78s]  It's probably time to start selling.
[15845.83s -> 15846.95s]  Sniper rifle all the way?
[15847.75s -> 15848.47s]  I can get clothes.
[15874.06s -> 15874.54s]  Very cool.
[15877.50s -> 15879.74s]  Oh, there's another one of those down there.
[15879.82s -> 15880.46s]  Nice.
[15880.46s -> 15882.22s]  All right, what can I do here?
[15882.22s -> 15887.58s]  There's another one of these?
[15888.82s -> 15889.38s]  Holy shit.
[15889.38s -> 15898.55s]  Okay, gotta check it out.
[15899.11s -> 15926.98s]  Oh no, this is just if you want to do it again.
[15926.98s -> 15927.86s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[15927.86s -> 15930.17s]  It's a really cool part of the game, but I'm good.
[15930.17s -> 15934.22s]  I don't need all S-Ranks.
[15934.22s -> 15945.69s]  Very cool.
[15945.69s -> 15946.41s]  Let's go.
[15946.41s -> 15956.12s]  Sell the old knife.
[15956.12s -> 15957.88s]  I'll probably just hang on to it, honestly.
[15957.88s -> 15961.18s]  I might need it.
[15961.18s -> 15971.11s]  Okay, this is where we're going.
[15971.11s -> 15971.98s]  Let's go.
[15972.54s -> 15981.22s]  Really?
[15989.42s -> 16011.66s]  You finishing the game tonight?
[16011.66s -> 16016.39s]  You betcha.
[16016.39s -> 16017.51s]  Yes, I am.
[16017.51s -> 16035.56s]  What happened up there?
[16040.57s -> 16042.49s]  Oh, come on, dude.
[16042.49s -> 16067.42s]  I hear a bug.
[16067.42s -> 16078.47s]  There's so many critters in this game.
[16078.47s -> 16079.43s]  There are a lot of critters.
[16079.43s -> 16080.07s]  You're right.
[16080.07s -> 16085.72s]  Why is it playing this music?
[16089.27s -> 16090.23s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[16090.23s -> 16091.11s]  Why is it playing this?
[16095.62s -> 16098.26s]  This is the look out, watch out music.
[16107.61s -> 16111.05s]  Nice.
[16111.05s -> 16112.81s]  We are under fucking attack.
[16112.81s -> 16126.07s]  Yeah, that is what that is going on in there.
[16126.07s -> 16128.63s]  There's a halloween house over here.
[16128.63s -> 16129.43s]  That's a haunted house.
[16138.68s -> 16164.98s]  Can you turn lo-fi beats on?
[16167.54s -> 16168.66s]  You can just open it.
[16168.66s -> 16207.82s]  That is a shitload of people here now.
[16207.82s -> 16208.86s]  Throw it, throw it out here.
[16208.86s -> 16217.53s]  Is that guy still in there or is he dead?
[16218.84s -> 16220.20s]  Oh, he died.
[16220.20s -> 16224.70s]  That's a lot of ammo.
[16229.72s -> 16231.72s]  Any plans for a Yonkey Splonkey 2?
[16232.28s -> 16234.04s]  You had an OG Twitch dance.
[16234.04s -> 16235.48s]  Now, everyone's doing their own thing.
[16243.75s -> 16244.47s]  I don't know if my...
[16245.50s -> 16247.02s]  I think you guys came up with that.
[16247.02s -> 16249.50s]  I kind of just did a dance and then you guys named it.
[16249.50s -> 16258.07s]  What's that sound?
[16258.07s -> 16268.01s]  Do a Yonkey Splonkey remake.
[16268.01s -> 16283.02s]  Where is it?
[16283.02s -> 16283.90s]  That was pretty good.
[16284.62s -> 16285.74s]  That was actually really good.
[16289.26s -> 16290.06s]  Oh, thank God.
[16297.08s -> 16297.88s]  Oh my God.
[16297.96s -> 16298.36s]  Oh my God.
[16298.36s -> 16298.76s]  Oh my God.
[16298.76s -> 16299.08s]  Oh my God.
[16299.08s -> 16306.39s]  Oh my God.
[16306.39s -> 16325.40s]  Oh, oh my goodness.
[16326.90s -> 16327.46s]  Where'd it go?
[16336.38s -> 16337.50s]  It's opening the door.
[16345.30s -> 16347.94s]  Dude, it's fucking opening doors.
[16347.94s -> 16363.91s]  I forgot the last arc of this game goes very, very hard.
[16368.07s -> 16369.93s]  Gets crazy.
[16369.93s -> 16382.20s]  Okay, nice.
[16382.20s -> 16391.06s]  I hate all things that are critters.
[16391.06s -> 16392.73s]  Why do you hate critters?
[16392.73s -> 16395.80s]  You don't like critters?
[16395.80s -> 16396.44s]  Why not?
[16396.44s -> 16397.00s]  What's wrong?
[16397.00s -> 16415.00s]  Okay, well, I need to turn that off.
[16415.00s -> 16415.88s]  It's 11-11.
[16415.88s -> 16416.68s]  Make a wish.
[16416.68s -> 16443.85s]  What'd you wish for?
[16443.85s -> 16445.29s]  You can't tell people what you wish for.
[16445.29s -> 16453.50s]  Otherwise, it won't come true.
[16453.50s -> 16454.70s]  I know some of you.
[16454.70s -> 16458.18s]  Some of you have only wished for this.
[16458.18s -> 16465.26s]  The Yonkey Splonkey remake.
[16465.26s -> 16466.30s]  Wish granted.
[16466.30s -> 16493.16s]  Anything over here?
[16493.16s -> 16503.75s]  Hot scene, probably.
[16511.91s -> 16527.19s]  I hear red barrel.
[16527.19s -> 16529.70s]  All right.
[16529.70s -> 16530.98s]  I, Adam.
[16548.58s -> 16562.46s]  It didn't go far enough.
[16562.46s -> 16585.34s]  But I wish to share this gift with as many as possible.
[16586.68s -> 16588.28s]  A humble wish, don't you think?
[16590.01s -> 16595.16s]  You see, we are all connected through the Holy Body.
[16595.16s -> 16599.16s]  And now your flesh and bones, your very thoughts.
[16600.04s -> 16600.92s]  Is that a skull?
[16604.02s -> 16606.50s]  It kind of looks like Bowser from the old Mario movie.
[16607.22s -> 16614.79s]  Accept the sacred gift.
[16618.42s -> 16619.38s]  She did.
[16620.42s -> 16620.90s]  Souther!
[16625.40s -> 16627.32s]  Yes, the time has come.
[16628.20s -> 16631.08s]  We'll be slain to join our covenant.
[16631.80s -> 16635.96s]  Oh, blessings on to him and the sweet mercy they bring.
[16636.04s -> 16636.68s]  And salt!
[16637.96s -> 16640.28s]  And let it be salt!
[16644.28s -> 16644.84s]  Ah, shit!
[16645.88s -> 16654.54s]  Let's get out of here.
[16665.58s -> 16678.38s]  All right.
[16678.38s -> 16678.94s]  Time to go.
[16685.32s -> 16686.76s]  Any items over here?
[16699.94s -> 16702.44s]  Where do we go?
[16702.44s -> 16703.32s]  Laboratory B.
[16704.04s -> 16727.38s]  Okay, let's go.
[16727.38s -> 16728.18s]  Come on.
[16728.18s -> 16752.15s]  It's got a lot of strength still.
[16752.15s -> 16761.61s]  Come on.
[16761.61s -> 16763.21s]  We gotta get fixed up.
[16789.35s -> 16808.10s]  I was waiting for a jump scare.
[16808.10s -> 16812.12s]  One of them is not going to grab me.
[16812.12s -> 16824.12s]  The Undertaker entrance for WrestleMania.
[16842.01s -> 16842.89s]  I loved that song.
[16843.45s -> 16843.93s]  It was great.
[16854.33s -> 16855.29s]  That was the remix version.
[16856.33s -> 16857.05s]  Not the original.
[16857.69s -> 16918.30s]  Fuck, I gotta do it now.
[16918.30s -> 16919.18s]  Never mind.
[16919.18s -> 16928.30s]  He's faking.
[16928.30s -> 16929.18s]  What a faker?
[16929.18s -> 16936.12s]  What do you mean faker?
[16936.12s -> 16937.48s]  He's faking it.
[16937.48s -> 16942.73s]  Have we so fucked up?
[16942.73s -> 16943.93s]  All right, this is the end.
[16943.93s -> 16947.16s]  It was an awesome journey.
[16947.16s -> 16948.79s]  It's time to get to the end.
[16973.03s -> 16974.23s]  By the way, I didn't do it yet.
[16974.23s -> 16976.25s]  I don't know how to do it.
[16976.25s -> 16977.37s]  Yeah, I did this.
[16977.37s -> 16979.13s]  And by the way, in me trying to figure it out,
[16979.13s -> 16980.49s]  I broke two of the lasers.
[16981.05s -> 16985.72s]  You're gonna have to hold one of them
[16985.72s -> 16988.07s]  against your chest for the next four hours.
[16988.07s -> 16988.95s]  Yeah, I found it.
[16988.95s -> 16995.11s]  I think it says we can get out if we can.
[16995.11s -> 16997.19s]  Hey, we're a team, right?
[16997.19s -> 17001.06s]  Keep this up.
[17001.06s -> 17001.94s]  I'll be out of a job.
[17004.98s -> 17007.14s]  Oh yeah, did you draw on the map with the crayon?
[17007.14s -> 17011.03s]  All of this.
[17011.03s -> 17013.29s]  Removing the parasites.
[17013.29s -> 17014.17s]  This was the week.
[17015.56s -> 17017.24s]  Yeah, we're alive.
[17018.42s -> 17018.98s]  Thanks to him.
[17019.54s -> 17022.70s]  I'm surprised this thing even booted up.
[17024.28s -> 17026.28s]  Man, Lewis got this thing going on a raspberry pea?
[17028.12s -> 17028.84s]  That's impressive.
[17029.48s -> 17038.06s]  Do not be fooled into thinking that
[17038.06s -> 17041.42s]  Las Plagas are merely tools for creating powerful bioweapons.
[17041.42s -> 17044.14s]  The true value lies in their ability to control.
[17044.14s -> 17046.55s]  No matter, I've been doing that a lot today,
[17046.55s -> 17048.90s]  that no matter how hostile the subject is,
[17048.90s -> 17051.30s]  single injection can turn anyone into a faithful servant
[17051.30s -> 17053.54s]  who needs spies and you can turn yesterday's enemy
[17053.54s -> 17054.58s]  into today's ally.
[17055.14s -> 17057.11s]  Controlling just one insider
[17057.11s -> 17058.63s]  can bring an entire organization
[17058.63s -> 17060.97s]  or an entire country to its knees.
[17062.36s -> 17064.12s]  Mass production of the superior species
[17064.12s -> 17065.72s]  has made this possible.
[17065.72s -> 17068.30s]  We have empowered Saddler.
[17068.30s -> 17072.12s]  It's clear what he intends to do next.
[17072.12s -> 17074.84s]  Can you imagine if Saddler had that much control?
[17075.48s -> 17078.28s]  Six billion loyal servants at his sole command.
[17078.28s -> 17080.63s]  There'd be no opposition, no war.
[17080.63s -> 17083.88s]  If for the first time in human history,
[17084.52s -> 17085.96s]  the world would know peace.
[17085.96s -> 17088.78s]  But I know how Saddler and the others
[17088.78s -> 17091.91s]  have oppressed the people of this island for generations.
[17091.91s -> 17093.03s]  I know how he treats them.
[17093.11s -> 17094.65s]  That's no way to live.
[17094.65s -> 17102.20s]  And because of that, I won't let it happen.
[17102.20s -> 17102.84s]  Who wrote this?
[17106.30s -> 17106.94s]  Who wrote this?
[17114.58s -> 17116.20s]  That was Louis, okay.
[17117.00s -> 17117.48s]  Makes sense.
[17124.38s -> 17126.14s]  Europe Laboratory Six Dream Team.
[17130.33s -> 17131.29s]  Holy shit, guys.
[17131.29s -> 17133.70s]  Wait, this is Europe Laboratory Six.
[17133.70s -> 17136.44s]  This is Umbrella.
[17136.44s -> 17137.16s]  Holy shit.
[17149.75s -> 17150.79s]  Damn, what's this?
[17150.79s -> 17153.19s]  Someone had a field day looting the Umbrella Labs.
[17162.76s -> 17163.80s]  What the hell was that?
[17163.80s -> 17165.96s]  Any treasures in here?
[17169.46s -> 17172.49s]  First aid spray.
[17172.49s -> 17172.99s]  Okay.
[17174.04s -> 17187.26s]  Let's complete this game.
[17187.26s -> 17187.90s]  Sorry.
[17187.90s -> 17188.54s]  Raspberry P.
[17199.40s -> 17199.72s]  Thank you.
[17211.69s -> 17212.17s]  I think so.
[17213.05s -> 17213.93s]  All right.
[17213.93s -> 17215.61s]  This inventory is a mess.
[17215.61s -> 17227.16s]  This inventory is a mess.
[17228.44s -> 17229.56s]  Why is it such a mess?
[17246.33s -> 17260.28s]  School health.
[17260.28s -> 17263.94s]  Why am I angry?
[17263.94s -> 17265.30s]  Why does everyone think I'm angry today?
[17267.27s -> 17267.91s]  I'm not.
[17267.91s -> 17268.39s]  What?
[17268.39s -> 17270.07s]  Does my brow look weird?
[17270.07s -> 17270.87s]  Does my face look weird?
[17270.87s -> 17271.27s]  What's wrong?
[17272.07s -> 17280.98s]  What do you mean?
[17289.43s -> 17290.79s]  Your face is very mean today.
[17291.35s -> 17293.08s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[17301.06s -> 17301.62s]  It's a treasure.
[17301.62s -> 17302.66s]  Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
[17302.66s -> 17303.14s]  Eh, we're good.
[17303.14s -> 17305.30s]  She's not the type to roll over that easy.
[17305.30s -> 17313.88s]  That's because you said no roadblocks.
[17319.11s -> 17319.83s]  True.
[17319.83s -> 17328.23s]  Okay.
[17328.23s -> 17328.95s]  Wait.
[17328.95s -> 17330.30s]  Secret.
[17334.07s -> 17334.63s]  No secret?
[17335.27s -> 17336.79s]  Was the secret the other way?
[17337.35s -> 17338.84s]  There are two ways to go.
[17340.94s -> 17342.78s]  Resident Evil more like Resident Sleeper.
[17347.05s -> 17353.48s]  We already went this way.
[17353.48s -> 17354.04s]  Hmm?
[17354.04s -> 17356.58s]  Resident Evil more like Resident Sleeper.
[17363.96s -> 17378.90s]  The final chapter of the Illuminatos.
[17379.38s -> 17381.62s]  Praise be to the holy insects.
[17381.62s -> 17384.62s]  We have been promised paradise on earth.
[17384.62s -> 17387.98s]  Man, woman, or child, his love does not discriminate.
[17387.98s -> 17391.10s]  Beast, fish, or bird, all creatures shall be equally blessed.
[17391.10s -> 17393.18s]  Praise be to the holy insects.
[17393.18s -> 17395.02s]  We are the humble servants of God.
[17395.02s -> 17397.27s]  His wisdom will overcome any mountain.
[17397.27s -> 17400.06s]  His omnipotence will cross any ocean.
[17400.06s -> 17403.38s]  The light of heaven dwells in all things.
[17403.38s -> 17405.06s]  Let our bodies be the seedbed.
[17405.96s -> 17407.48s]  Praise be to the holy insects.
[17407.48s -> 17409.64s]  We are the flock and the shepherd guides us.
[17409.64s -> 17412.04s]  Our prayers will be sung all over the world.
[17412.04s -> 17414.07s]  They will be heard by all.
[17414.07s -> 17422.34s]  At last, we shall exceed the stars in the sky.
[17422.34s -> 17429.72s]  Osmond, deep beneath the castle grounds, I have found my faith.
[17429.72s -> 17433.32s]  Oh, behold, the divine vestiges left upon this world.
[17433.32s -> 17434.76s]  It all begins here.
[17434.76s -> 17435.56s]  Adam Sandler.
[17436.12s -> 17439.13s]  Oh, nice.
[17439.13s -> 17450.60s]  Get out of here.
[17450.60s -> 17467.75s]  I think I have to go that way.
[17472.86s -> 17475.26s]  Lord and Savior, Adam Sandler.
[17482.55s -> 17482.79s]  Yes.
[17488.58s -> 17489.06s]  Treasures?
[17489.78s -> 17490.10s]  Yep.
[17490.10s -> 17491.46s]  There are two treasures in here.
[17497.46s -> 17507.45s]  What are you doing?
[17526.60s -> 17527.24s]  Got it.
[17527.24s -> 17529.45s]  There's one more.
[17529.45s -> 17531.90s]  It's in this room.
[17531.90s -> 17536.09s]  I think this is it.
[17536.09s -> 17537.83s]  Wow.
[17537.83s -> 17539.59s]  I'm pretty sure this is it.
[17539.59s -> 17541.11s]  This is the this is the end here.
[17541.11s -> 17541.91s]  I think this is the end.
[17566.60s -> 17567.72s]  Is it time to sell everything?
[17576.25s -> 17577.85s]  I think about time to sell literally everything.
[17582.07s -> 17584.63s]  Because I think this is actually the last place to see him.
[17584.63s -> 17586.31s]  That's our choice to make.
[17586.31s -> 17587.19s]  I think it's time to do it.
[17589.37s -> 17591.77s]  If you can't beat the jet ski escape within three tries,
[17591.77s -> 17595.03s]  you have to play Roblox for one hour on your birthday.
[17595.03s -> 17595.35s]  Right.
[17595.35s -> 17595.59s]  Okay.
[17596.15s -> 17599.72s]  Don't sell the key.
[17599.72s -> 17600.20s]  I already did.
[17601.40s -> 17602.68s]  Sell all your weapons, too.
[17603.56s -> 17604.04s]  Everything.
[17605.69s -> 17611.45s]  Sell everything and then walk out with nothing.
[17617.82s -> 17618.46s]  I think that's good.
[17623.64s -> 17624.36s]  Final tune up.
[17632.97s -> 17633.93s]  This is all good.
[17633.93s -> 17634.17s]  All right.
[17634.17s -> 17635.45s]  We can do we can do this.
[17635.45s -> 17637.13s]  Let's do ammo capacity.
[17637.93s -> 17639.13s]  See how that feels.
[17639.13s -> 17643.05s]  And then a fellow like yourself should notice whatever I can do with this.
[17643.77s -> 17646.01s]  This kind of work is about finesse.
[17647.91s -> 17651.43s]  You've exhausted our normal range of services for this weapon.
[17651.43s -> 17651.75s]  All right.
[17651.75s -> 17652.63s]  This thing's good to go.
[17652.63s -> 17653.43s]  Too bad I couldn't get it.
[17654.31s -> 17654.79s]  But it's all good.
[17655.59s -> 17659.26s]  You catch my drift.
[17659.26s -> 17660.30s]  Buy the RPG.
[17661.56s -> 17662.68s]  Now I'm good.
[17664.52s -> 17665.32s]  Gotta come back.
[17666.12s -> 17676.02s]  Now we're good.
[17676.50s -> 17677.22s]  Any time.
[17678.47s -> 17678.79s]  All right.
[17678.79s -> 17680.87s]  I've got my sniper rifle.
[17680.87s -> 17683.29s]  My Omega shotgun.
[17683.29s -> 17687.45s]  20 shots with a times almost two damage on the broken butterfly.
[17687.45s -> 17690.31s]  This is going to be perfect.
[17690.31s -> 17691.27s]  RPG.
[17691.27s -> 17692.58s]  What do you mean?
[17692.58s -> 17693.94s]  Buy the RPG or you.
[17694.50s -> 17698.97s]  I don't want the RPG.
[17703.22s -> 17704.10s]  I got what I want.
[17705.18s -> 17709.90s]  And that's 20 shots with a quadruple damage magnum.
[17710.86s -> 17713.29s]  48 slugs.
[17713.29s -> 17713.85s]  I'm ready.
[17713.85s -> 17714.89s]  I'm unloading everything.
[17719.03s -> 17719.59s]  Anything?
[17719.59s -> 17722.92s]  I customize anything here at this point.
[17722.92s -> 17728.86s]  I don't think it matters.
[17728.86s -> 17729.75s]  Maybe the healing.
[17730.31s -> 17732.15s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[17732.15s -> 17732.31s]  All right.
[17732.31s -> 17732.63s]  Let's go.
[17733.27s -> 17736.23s]  Send it.
[17736.79s -> 17742.66s]  Can we wager that you will miss the first shot with the magnum?
[17742.66s -> 17742.90s]  Sure.
[17743.46s -> 17744.22s]  Good.
[17744.22s -> 17744.70s]  Make a bet.
[17745.51s -> 17747.99s]  Will I miss the first shot I do with the magnum?
[17751.10s -> 17751.50s]  Go for it.
[17752.06s -> 17753.05s]  Go ahead and vote.
[17753.99s -> 17754.63s]  You can bet that.
[17756.60s -> 17757.32s]  Now, wait, wait, wait.
[17757.32s -> 17758.36s]  What constitutes a miss?
[17758.36s -> 17758.92s]  That's important.
[17759.48s -> 17761.53s]  Like a complete miss.
[17761.53s -> 17762.97s]  Don't hit any body part at all.
[17763.61s -> 17766.89s]  Or I have to hit the exact spot that that matters.
[17766.97s -> 17768.33s]  Like the weakness part.
[17768.97s -> 17770.97s]  We need to make that clear.
[17770.97s -> 17773.21s]  We're talking about no damage, a complete miss.
[17773.21s -> 17774.09s]  Just a complete miss.
[17776.86s -> 17777.18s]  Okay.
[17777.18s -> 17777.98s]  Or weak spot.
[17777.98s -> 17778.30s]  Okay.
[17778.86s -> 17781.02s]  So if I miss the weak spot with the first shot,
[17781.02s -> 17783.10s]  then you can go ahead and pay everybody out.
[17783.74s -> 17785.90s]  If I hit the weak spot with the first shot,
[17785.90s -> 17786.94s]  then you lose.
[17786.94s -> 17788.54s]  And everybody else that's betting on me wins.
[17789.18s -> 17791.32s]  The weak spot.
[17791.32s -> 17791.88s]  No, I'll hit it.
[17791.88s -> 17792.36s]  That's easy.
[17793.08s -> 17793.48s]  I'm telling you.
[17793.48s -> 17793.88s]  That's simple.
[17796.39s -> 17797.03s]  It's I'm telling you.
[17797.03s -> 17797.83s]  It's simple.
[17797.83s -> 17798.76s]  I'll be fine.
[17812.89s -> 17819.00s]  Ada thinks he's going to lure me out.
[17820.09s -> 17820.89s]  Well, it worked.
[17821.29s -> 17822.01s]  Because here we come.
[17825.69s -> 17826.17s]  Stay here.
[17826.73s -> 17827.62s]  I won't be long.
[17843.54s -> 17851.45s]  A heads up would have been a little more appreciated probably.
[17876.57s -> 17878.57s]  Real missed opportunity for him to be like,
[17878.57s -> 17880.78s]  you'll never get away with this.
[17881.50s -> 17882.46s]  That would have been perfect.
[17892.74s -> 17892.98s]  All right.
[17892.98s -> 17894.34s]  I got to focus because I don't want to miss it.
[17925.75s -> 17926.95s]  I know where the weak parts are.
[17940.73s -> 17941.05s]  Got it.
[17965.48s -> 17967.00s]  Oh, that stings.
[17993.50s -> 17998.90s]  Oh, oh, please.
[18012.63s -> 18014.79s]  I have so much shit in my inventory.
[18028.84s -> 18029.56s]  Get away from me.
[18036.23s -> 18075.59s]  Oh, oh, I had to end it with the shotgun.
[18075.59s -> 18090.18s]  Getting sick of your shit.
[18119.43s -> 18120.31s]  Oh, my God.
[18120.31s -> 18121.75s]  That was a lot of damage, though.
[18153.02s -> 18157.82s]  See you later.
[18157.82s -> 18158.62s]  Give me that shit.
[18169.56s -> 18171.16s]  All 50 shots almost.
[18182.38s -> 18191.85s]  Worked out pretty well.
[18191.85s -> 18192.57s]  That was pretty cool.
[18203.24s -> 18205.40s]  And he take if you don't do the rocket launcher thing,
[18205.40s -> 18206.92s]  he takes a lot of hits at the end there.
[18206.92s -> 18222.54s]  50 slugs, Steven does it again.
[18222.54s -> 18223.50s]  Nothing personal, Leon.
[18223.50s -> 18225.75s]  Luis and I had an arrangement.
[18225.75s -> 18228.97s]  I'll take good care of it.
[18228.97s -> 18231.35s]  What was it?
[18231.35s -> 18234.23s]  Three attempts or I have to play Roblox on April 5th or whatever it is?
[18234.87s -> 18235.74s]  Fight's here.
[18236.62s -> 18243.00s]  We both know this.
[18243.72s -> 18245.16s]  It's where we go our separate ways.
[18249.22s -> 18249.62s]  I see.
[18250.50s -> 18262.02s]  I wonder how hard that is on hardcore and professional.
[18262.02s -> 18263.38s]  Professional's probably a joke.
[18263.38s -> 18264.58s]  Better get a move on.
[18264.58s -> 18267.38s]  Am I a joke as in almost impossible?
[18267.38s -> 18287.64s]  Where is she going?
[18287.64s -> 18288.60s]  Who knows?
[18288.60s -> 18289.40s]  I don't understand.
[18289.40s -> 18290.04s]  Why would she just?
[18290.84s -> 18292.04s]  I'm gonna move.
[18292.04s -> 18293.16s]  Island's gonna blow.
[18293.16s -> 18293.66s]  Go.
[18300.06s -> 18300.70s]  Go.
[18300.70s -> 18301.26s]  Time to run.
[18301.90s -> 18309.78s]  We got two minutes to get out of here.
[18314.73s -> 18325.90s]  Anything else?
[18326.98s -> 18327.22s]  Why?
[18327.22s -> 18327.86s]  Who cares if you go?
[18336.81s -> 18337.29s]  Not yet.
[18352.58s -> 18355.06s]  Keep up the pace.
[18355.06s -> 18355.54s]  Jesus.
[18356.34s -> 18363.30s]  What's going on there?
[18363.30s -> 18373.58s]  I love this rat.
[18374.14s -> 18375.90s]  Can we take one of the rats with us?
[18378.28s -> 18378.76s]  Open it.
[18380.70s -> 18381.98s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[18409.90s -> 18410.78s]  Let's do it.
[18410.78s -> 18411.34s]  All right.
[18411.34s -> 18412.06s]  Don't fuck it up.
[18412.06s -> 18413.26s]  I got three tries.
[18415.19s -> 18416.23s]  We got to play Roblox.
[18435.37s -> 18436.65s]  It's pretty forgiving.
[18436.65s -> 18437.77s]  It's kind of, it's forgiving.
[18437.77s -> 18438.25s]  I'm all right.
[18498.58s -> 18500.81s]  I did it.
[18500.81s -> 18501.21s]  I win.
[18504.89s -> 18506.73s]  Happy birthday to you.
[18521.98s -> 18523.34s]  Baby, what is this title?
[18523.34s -> 18525.18s]  What is going on in the title right now?
[18525.18s -> 18539.85s]  Mission accomplished, right?
[18539.85s -> 18544.90s]  Mission accomplished.
[18544.90s -> 18545.38s]  I'm safe.
[18546.34s -> 18547.38s]  Ashley B.
[18547.38s -> 18548.50s]  Thank you for saving me.
[18548.50s -> 18549.46s]  Jet Ski's out of gas.
[18550.26s -> 18550.98s]  Don't mention it.
[18550.98s -> 18553.54s]  And I only brought one more bologna and cheese sandwich.
[18553.54s -> 18555.22s]  I could put an award with my dad.
[18555.22s -> 18555.46s]  Where?
[18555.46s -> 18555.70s]  Fuck.
[18555.70s -> 18557.06s]  Have you assigned to my detail?
[18557.06s -> 18557.86s]  If you're interested.
[18559.54s -> 18560.26s]  You don't need me.
[18560.82s -> 18563.02s]  You proved you could handle yourself.
[18563.66s -> 18566.39s]  Even if you could use a lesson in knife safety.
[18567.67s -> 18568.70s]  Come on.
[18569.82s -> 18570.46s]  Let's go home.
[18572.14s -> 18584.06s]  Rooster Condor 1, do you read me?
[18584.06s -> 18587.02s]  We are not making it back to America.
[18587.02s -> 18588.62s]  Is this thing even on?
[18588.62s -> 18591.02s]  Like four gallons of gas.
[18591.02s -> 18592.46s]  Whatever it takes in a Jet Ski.
[18592.46s -> 18593.66s]  Where are we?
[18593.66s -> 18595.99s]  There's like three gallons.
[18596.55s -> 18608.34s]  That's great.
[18620.30s -> 18621.26s]  If you liked it.
[18621.26s -> 18622.70s]  If you liked Resident Evil 4
[18622.78s -> 18624.46s]  and you're trying to figure out if you should get the remake.
[18624.46s -> 18625.02s]  You should.
[18625.02s -> 18625.82s]  Absolutely.
[18625.82s -> 18626.54s]  That's phenomenal.
[18629.27s -> 18630.31s]  And it's Resident Evil 4.
[18630.31s -> 18631.35s]  Of course it is.
[18631.35s -> 18651.67s]  Why'd you take the label off your chapstick?
[18651.67s -> 18652.15s]  I didn't.
[18653.08s -> 18654.84s]  It's like it's in a tube.
[18655.40s -> 18657.88s]  It goes like like a little closer.
[18662.38s -> 18664.38s]  It's like Trader Joe's.
[18664.38s -> 18665.82s]  Trader Joe's cucumber mint.
[18666.81s -> 18667.29s]  It's like a...
[18690.39s -> 18698.01s]  So the Plaga storyline goes through six.
[18698.01s -> 18699.69s]  And then the mold is seven up.
[18700.41s -> 18703.21s]  And then the virus, the T-virus is one, two, three.
[18703.85s -> 18704.65s]  Or the virus.
[18705.37s -> 18716.23s]  Do you think they'll remake five and six?
[18718.30s -> 18720.70s]  Judging by how well these do, I think.
[18720.70s -> 18722.30s]  And how much people really like these.
[18723.18s -> 18724.55s]  I don't know if they're going to do six.
[18724.55s -> 18727.03s]  But five is probably up next in a few years.
[18727.03s -> 18727.59s]  I would imagine.
[18730.78s -> 18731.50s]  I think six is...
[18732.06s -> 18733.26s]  I think you just percent...
[18733.26s -> 18735.26s]  I think you just pretend six didn't just never existed.
[18743.22s -> 18743.54s]  I don't know.
[18743.54s -> 18744.66s]  You'd have to remake the whole game.
[18744.66s -> 18746.10s]  Six was just not a good game either.
[18747.05s -> 18748.65s]  Four and five were good games.
[18748.65s -> 18749.93s]  To me, six was not a good game.
[18749.93s -> 18751.05s]  Six was a pretty bad game.
[18751.69s -> 18754.97s]  So you'd have to do a lot to make a remake of six, I think, better.
[18754.97s -> 18756.25s]  I've obtained the amber.
[18756.89s -> 18758.33s]  Excellent.
[18758.89s -> 18761.67s]  Just one question.
[18762.39s -> 18764.18s]  What are you planning to do with this?
[18764.98s -> 18767.70s]  Do not pay you to ask questions.
[18768.50s -> 18773.37s]  You need to know, as a new dawn is breaking.
[18774.25s -> 18777.85s]  A hundred will give their lives so that just one may live.
[18779.70s -> 18783.21s]  I, expediting that change.
[18783.85s -> 18788.89s]  So, we're talking millions of casualties.
[18790.34s -> 18790.98s]  Billions.
[18794.22s -> 18794.94s]  How ambitious.
[18800.38s -> 18801.74s]  We're changing course.
[18801.74s -> 18802.38s]  Now.
[18802.38s -> 18810.92s]  I think five was kind of polarizing.
[18810.92s -> 18812.52s]  But I really liked five.
[18812.52s -> 18813.56s]  I thought five was really fun.
[18816.15s -> 18819.91s]  Five was kind of four, but a little more stuff.
[18819.91s -> 18820.31s]  A little...
[18820.31s -> 18821.91s]  It had the whole co-op, right?
[18821.91s -> 18822.63s]  That was a lot of fun.
[18826.28s -> 18827.80s]  I think people give five a lot of shit.
[18827.80s -> 18828.76s]  I thought five was really good.
[18830.46s -> 18831.98s]  I don't think it's as good as four, but I think it's...
[18832.54s -> 18833.82s]  It was a worthy sequel, I think.
[18838.92s -> 18840.44s]  Six, they just went completely...
[18841.64s -> 18842.84s]  It was a mess.
[18844.18s -> 18845.22s]  Six, I don't even...
[18845.22s -> 18846.90s]  Honestly, I've played six recently.
[18847.72s -> 18848.92s]  And I don't even remember it.
[18850.33s -> 18851.13s]  I have no idea.
[18858.47s -> 18859.11s]  Seven was good.
[18860.55s -> 18862.39s]  Yeah, the new arc was fun.
[18863.42s -> 18869.06s]  I like seven and eight.
[18869.06s -> 18870.26s]  Yeah, me and italics played it.
[18878.84s -> 18879.72s]  Yeah, the new ones were good.
[18879.72s -> 18880.28s]  I liked them both.
[18886.94s -> 18890.22s]  The two remake was hard to beat when it comes to remake.
[18890.22s -> 18891.82s]  But I think they came pretty close on this one.
[18892.62s -> 18898.01s]  I love this franchise.
[18898.01s -> 18898.81s]  It's a great franchise.
[18902.97s -> 18905.13s]  Resident Evil is one of the only franchises I can really think of
[18905.85s -> 18911.14s]  that has actually continued to do really, really great games.
[18912.25s -> 18912.89s]  This far.
[18913.45s -> 18915.69s]  This laid into the whole franchise.
[18919.86s -> 18920.74s]  They're still making...
[18920.74s -> 18922.74s]  I mean, you know, Resident Evil is seven and eight.
[18922.74s -> 18924.02s]  Where a lot of people, you know...
[18924.82s -> 18925.85s]  I think they were good.
[18926.73s -> 18929.29s]  I think that they're from one through eight.
[18930.82s -> 18933.46s]  Only one or two of them are really not that great.
[18934.42s -> 18938.50s]  I think as a whole, the whole franchise has been doing really well still.
[18939.22s -> 18939.94s]  So it's really cool.
[18939.94s -> 18941.06s]  I mean, I love Resident Evil.
[18941.06s -> 18941.62s]  I always have.
[18942.58s -> 18946.06s]  You said eight's ending was shitty.
[18947.02s -> 18948.70s]  Yeah, but the game as a whole was fun.
[18949.50s -> 18950.78s]  It was worth playing.
[18950.78s -> 18952.14s]  It was worthy to play it.
[18952.14s -> 18952.62s]  It was good.
[18953.26s -> 18965.37s]  Listen to this song.
[18965.37s -> 18973.85s]  You should play Mercenaries when it comes out.
[18974.97s -> 18975.69s]  Yeah, what's the new...
[18975.69s -> 18978.81s]  What's the content release schedule for this?
[18979.61s -> 18980.81s]  Because there's a couple of things, right?
[18980.89s -> 18982.97s]  There's the little spoilers, but...
[18985.32s -> 18986.28s]  Ada's campaign.
[18990.36s -> 18991.08s]  April 7th.
[18991.08s -> 18991.80s]  That's it, really.
[18992.60s -> 18993.32s]  Drops next week.
[18993.32s -> 18993.80s]  Oh, shit.
[18993.80s -> 18994.12s]  All right.
[18997.14s -> 18998.90s]  Are we gonna get the Ada, please?
[18999.62s -> 19000.18s]  Play through?
[19000.18s -> 19001.22s]  Or is that probably gonna be DLC?
[19002.10s -> 19006.76s]  Hasn't been announced.
[19006.76s -> 19011.05s]  That's cool, though.
[19011.05s -> 19013.56s]  Yeah, Mercenaries was a ton of fun.
[19013.56s -> 19017.00s]  I dumped hours and hours and hours into it when it first came out.
[19019.85s -> 19020.49s]  Long time ago.
[19021.05s -> 19025.16s]  All right, well, we have to spend our currency.
[19026.33s -> 19029.53s]  I have like 20,000 of it or something.
[19029.53s -> 19030.41s]  Let's go to the bonuses.
[19033.48s -> 19035.80s]  Yeah, I'm not even gonna give you a rating.
[19035.80s -> 19036.76s]  You know what it is.
[19036.76s -> 19038.84s]  It's at least a nine plus.
[19038.84s -> 19039.32s]  It just is.
[19040.12s -> 19042.04s]  Resident Evil 4 is one of the best games ever made.
[19042.04s -> 19043.48s]  This was a great remake.
[19044.28s -> 19046.34s]  They did a very, very good job.
[19046.34s -> 19048.90s]  How do you tackle a game like this everybody loves?
[19049.46s -> 19051.06s]  And it's some people's favorite game ever made.
[19051.06s -> 19052.02s]  I think they did a really good job.
[19052.50s -> 19053.54s]  I think it's worth buying, for sure.
[19057.67s -> 19059.19s]  The old one is still good to go back to,
[19059.19s -> 19060.71s]  but I think they did a justice, for sure.
[19061.35s -> 19061.91s]  Great.
[19061.91s -> 19074.25s]  They redeemed themselves after the Resident Evil 3 remake.
[19074.81s -> 19075.85s]  Oh, yeah, 100%.
[19080.33s -> 19082.86s]  Absolutely.
[19082.86s -> 19084.86s]  The third remake was, it was all right.
[19086.17s -> 19089.86s]  Looking back with some time, it was all right.
[19089.86s -> 19093.21s]  Could have been a lot better.
[19093.21s -> 19096.87s]  But remember, they were coming right off of Resident Evil 2's remake,
[19096.87s -> 19100.55s]  which is, I mean, that was game of the year for me, for a lot of people.
[19101.74s -> 19103.82s]  So right after that, it's like, oh, Resident Evil 3 remake.
[19103.82s -> 19105.50s]  It's gonna be so, it's gonna be just as good as two.
[19105.50s -> 19108.14s]  It's not even close to as good as the second remake.
[19108.14s -> 19108.54s]  Oh, no.
[19109.64s -> 19113.16s]  But if a game is a 7 versus like a 10, that's kind of unfair.
[19113.16s -> 19114.60s]  Like that game was like,
[19114.60s -> 19117.32s]  Resident Evil 2 was like a 9.8 for me, the remake.
[19118.94s -> 19121.50s]  You go right from that to like a solid, but like, hmm.
[19121.50s -> 19123.83s]  There's some, eh, it was all right.
[19123.83s -> 19124.87s]  Hard to do that.
[19124.87s -> 19127.51s]  Especially after Resident Evil 2's remake.
[19127.51s -> 19133.54s]  Just kind of rushed, yeah.
[19133.54s -> 19134.26s]  It was fine.
[19134.26s -> 19138.38s]  It was all right.
[19138.38s -> 19139.26s]  All right, I think we're good.
[19141.03s -> 19141.99s]  Should I just skip this, I think?
[19142.71s -> 19143.59s]  Probably.
[19143.59s -> 19152.92s]  Hold on, I want to listen to this song for a second.
[19152.92s -> 19163.34s]  What about the Dead Space remake?
[19163.34s -> 19164.38s]  Do you guys want to see that?
[19164.38s -> 19165.34s]  Should I play that on stream?
[19171.86s -> 19172.50s]  Yeah.
[19172.50s -> 19175.82s]  Should I play the remake or should I play the original one?
[19176.38s -> 19178.12s]  I heard the remake is really good.
[19178.68s -> 19180.04s]  So I'm imagining probably the remake.
[19184.15s -> 19184.71s]  You'd like it?
[19185.27s -> 19186.15s]  Cool.
[19186.15s -> 19190.50s]  All right, let's skip.
[19191.06s -> 19192.52s]  Get to the end.
[19193.08s -> 19195.38s]  Quiet.
[19195.38s -> 19210.46s]  Congratulations.
[19211.02s -> 19213.02s]  Good work.
[19213.02s -> 19213.50s]  Not gonna be.
[19216.86s -> 19217.34s]  Not gonna be.
[19217.90s -> 19223.32s]  Is it because I saved 114 times?
[19223.32s -> 19225.48s]  Is it because I saved 100 plus times?
[19226.38s -> 19227.82s]  If this was less than 100, it would have been A.
[19231.00s -> 19232.84s]  I just spam the save because it's like,
[19233.00s -> 19234.20s]  I sold this thing.
[19234.20s -> 19234.92s]  Save it.
[19234.92s -> 19236.20s]  Oh, I broke that thing.
[19236.20s -> 19237.00s]  Turn around, save it.
[19237.00s -> 19237.64s]  I just saved it.
[19237.64s -> 19238.92s]  I saved it one minute ago?
[19238.92s -> 19240.04s]  Did I save it one minute ago?
[19240.04s -> 19241.08s]  Just to be sure, save it again.
[19244.01s -> 19245.77s]  One save every 10 minutes.
[19248.82s -> 19249.78s]  It's just for time?
[19249.78s -> 19251.06s]  Okay, that's fine.
[19251.06s -> 19257.74s]  Complete the main story on standard or higher.
[19261.11s -> 19262.55s]  Unlocked a costume.
[19262.55s -> 19264.15s]  I got the pinstripe costume,
[19266.38s -> 19269.26s]  brown sunglasses and a foam mask
[19270.12s -> 19271.40s]  and a flight cap.
[19272.98s -> 19273.54s]  Cool.
[19273.54s -> 19280.76s]  Okay.
[19280.76s -> 19283.86s]  So I mean, I want to do this, right?
[19288.78s -> 19289.58s]  New playthrough.
[19298.89s -> 19300.01s]  All right, let's do the bonuses then.
[19300.65s -> 19302.17s]  Professional mode has been unlocked.
[19304.76s -> 19306.28s]  All right, extra content.
[19306.28s -> 19309.59s]  I got 21,000.
[19313.43s -> 19323.14s]  Buy everything.
[19323.14s -> 19323.62s]  Jacket.
[19329.48s -> 19329.80s]  All right.
[19329.80s -> 19330.44s]  Whoa, what's this?
[19337.11s -> 19337.83s]  Cool.
[19337.83s -> 19341.18s]  All right, hold on.
[19341.18s -> 19353.19s]  I think I have enough to get everything
[19353.19s -> 19353.91s]  or at least most.
[19354.87s -> 19384.79s]  Whoa, this is concept art.
[19384.79s -> 19386.49s]  I want to see this.
[19386.49s -> 19388.42s]  I want to see this.
[19388.42s -> 19389.91s]  I want to see this.
[19390.55s -> 19391.58s]  I want to see this.
[19392.30s -> 19392.94s]  I want to see this.
[19393.66s -> 19396.46s]  I want this.
[19396.46s -> 19397.45s]  I want this.
[19399.80s -> 19400.30s]  I want this.
[19401.53s -> 19402.03s]  This.
[19402.83s -> 19403.33s]  This.
[19411.82s -> 19412.32s]  This.
[19413.31s -> 19413.81s]  This.
[19414.48s -> 19414.98s]  This.
[19425.40s -> 19425.72s]  Weapons.
[19425.72s -> 19426.44s]  Get the weapons.
[19427.00s -> 19428.36s]  I can't, I don't have any.
[19428.36s -> 19435.76s]  At least unlock the cool models first.
[19435.76s -> 19436.00s]  What?
[19436.00s -> 19464.81s]  These are the cool ones.
[19464.81s -> 19465.37s]  All right.
[19465.37s -> 19482.76s]  Ooh, scary.
[19482.76s -> 19492.54s]  Hate these things.
[19492.54s -> 19506.35s]  Cool.
[19506.35s -> 19508.43s]  Look at that.
[19508.43s -> 19518.94s]  This looks really real somehow.
[19518.94s -> 19519.98s]  The shadows.
[19519.98s -> 19542.49s]  Okay.
[19542.49s -> 19543.69s]  Oh, pinstripe Leon.
[19543.69s -> 19545.37s]  Does pinstripe Leon say anything else?
[19545.37s -> 19595.04s]  I wish I had the whole playthrough with this.
[19595.04s -> 19599.04s]  Why do they have like Woody from Toy Story?
[19599.04s -> 19601.36s]  You pull the string.
[19601.36s -> 19624.62s]  Got a lot of stuff.
[19624.62s -> 19636.92s]  That's the one that goes,
[19636.92s -> 19637.96s]  Ah, yes, sir.
[19637.96s -> 19640.16s]  Right from the other one.
[19640.16s -> 19645.05s]  Oh, yep.
[19645.05s -> 19662.12s]  Ah, weird.
[19662.12s -> 19684.09s]  I just stepped on my router.
[19684.09s -> 19693.04s]  Just felt like, damn.
[19693.04s -> 19711.85s]  These guys were cool.
[19711.85s -> 19713.95s]  This was a cool.
[19713.95s -> 19715.47s]  I don't think these guys were in the old game.
[19715.47s -> 19716.51s]  So that's cool.
[19716.51s -> 19747.05s]  Bebop and Rocksteady.
[19747.05s -> 19748.01s]  Ah, these guys.
[19752.83s -> 19753.33s]  These guys.
[19798.97s -> 19803.16s]  It's kind of lame.
[19804.12s -> 19807.08s]  Oh, the biggest, scariest guy in the whole game.
[19807.08s -> 19808.44s]  The ultimate villain.
[19808.44s -> 19811.64s]  I am Osman Saddler.
[19811.64s -> 19812.99s]  It's just kind of like,
[19812.99s -> 19814.59s]  you could have done a different voice.
[19814.59s -> 19817.29s]  A different voice line than that.
[19817.29s -> 19821.76s]  That was just stating your name.
[19821.76s -> 19823.76s]  Not like, you will never escape me.
[19823.76s -> 19825.12s]  It has to be just kind of,
[19825.12s -> 19852.22s]  hey, this is who I am.
[19852.22s -> 19852.72s]  Cute.
[19859.05s -> 19868.19s]  Hey, did you have fun playing Resident Evil 4?
[19868.19s -> 19872.24s]  Did you like how much ammo you found?
[19872.24s -> 19876.54s]  Do you like Osman Saddler?
[19877.72s -> 19879.29s]  I didn't think so.
[19879.29s -> 19880.80s]  Are you smart?
[19880.88s -> 19881.92s]  Yeah, are you good?
[19882.48s -> 19885.04s]  Okay, now get out of here.
[19885.04s -> 19892.16s]  Oh, I can't do a voice line for this.
[19892.16s -> 19912.73s]  These are the incomplete ones.
[19912.73s -> 19914.49s]  I'm curious about some of these.
[19914.49s -> 19918.11s]  Survive the battle at the villa
[19918.11s -> 19920.51s]  without blocking any of the windows with wooden planks.
[19920.51s -> 19921.15s]  Okay.
[19921.15s -> 19925.10s]  Make it through Ashley's section
[19925.10s -> 19926.86s]  without using the lantern.
[19926.86s -> 19929.20s]  It's probably kind of hard.
[19929.20s -> 19935.21s]  What are some of the high?
[19935.21s -> 19936.65s]  Okay, this one's expensive.
[19936.65s -> 19939.52s]  Destroy all clockwork.
[19939.52s -> 19944.00s]  Oh, you get the super knife
[19944.00s -> 19954.27s]  for getting all 16 of them.
[19954.27s -> 19955.52s]  Very cool.
[19955.52s -> 19957.44s]  I do want to do one quick thing.
[19957.44s -> 19967.63s]  I just want to see.
[19972.36s -> 19973.96s]  Whoa, wait, hold on.
[19973.96s -> 19974.68s]  Face guard?
[19975.48s -> 19983.07s]  Oh, I can put this doesn't work with that.
[19983.63s -> 19984.19s]  I want to see.
[19996.56s -> 19997.20s]  I just want to see.
[20001.93s -> 20004.65s]  No auto save pairing is limited to perfect parries
[20004.65s -> 20005.85s]  and all weapon modifications
[20005.85s -> 20007.53s]  will be available from the start.
[20007.53s -> 20015.88s]  I just want to see the outfit.
[20015.88s -> 20020.96s]  Yeah, this is the end of the stream, by the way.
[20020.96s -> 20023.00s]  Those of you waiting.
[20031.77s -> 20039.39s]  I just want to see the costume.
[20041.45s -> 20042.25s]  Fucking dickhead.
[20051.00s -> 20052.20s]  Agent 47.
[20154.64s -> 20155.14s]  That's it.
[20157.18s -> 20159.18s]  What was that?
[20159.18s -> 20161.18s]  That was it.
[20161.18s -> 20164.11s]  Turn the original music on and sound effects.
[20164.11s -> 20165.23s]  Oh, I could do that.
[20165.23s -> 20166.16s]  No, that's it.
[20166.16s -> 20166.96s]  I'll see you guys later.
[20168.51s -> 20170.11s]  Let's talk about what the plan is
[20170.11s -> 20173.90s]  this upcoming next little bit.
[20173.90s -> 20179.08s]  So I will see you all on Friday.
[20179.64s -> 20183.58s]  I'll see you Friday.
[20183.58s -> 20186.70s]  So it is midnight Thursday.
[20187.26s -> 20188.88s]  I will see you guys on Friday.
[20189.44s -> 20191.34s]  We're going to just chill out a little bit.
[20192.14s -> 20193.98s]  Play some Breath of the Wild.
[20196.97s -> 20199.37s]  Just going to be working through it.
[20199.37s -> 20203.07s]  That was awesome.
[20203.07s -> 20204.99s]  I'm sad that it's kind of over.
[20204.99s -> 20213.15s]  It's a kind of post-awesome game depression, right?
[20213.15s -> 20214.67s]  Whatever you want to call it.
[20214.67s -> 20216.70s]  Like, oh, that was really cool.
[20216.70s -> 20217.42s]  That was great.
[20217.42s -> 20219.98s]  That was worth waiting for.
[20219.98s -> 20221.74s]  What an amazing game.
[20221.74s -> 20223.90s]  What an amazing experience.
[20223.90s -> 20226.22s]  And now it's over.
[20226.22s -> 20228.22s]  But it's not because I can play through it again.
[20228.22s -> 20229.02s]  There's a lot I didn't do.
[20231.77s -> 20232.73s]  But that was really good.
[20237.64s -> 20239.72s]  Also, keep in mind, again,
[20239.80s -> 20242.92s]  Grotto Beasts is going to be shipping
[20243.56s -> 20245.37s]  for at least the first pass,
[20245.37s -> 20248.81s]  the first pass of the pre-sale orders.
[20248.81s -> 20251.58s]  So over the next week or two,
[20251.58s -> 20258.89s]  I would keep an eye on your mailbox.
[20258.89s -> 20264.32s]  So I think we're very imminent on shipping.
[20264.32s -> 20265.84s]  So that's really exciting.
[20265.84s -> 20269.82s]  Say again when the pre-sale ends.
[20269.82s -> 20272.30s]  So you could effectively operate
[20272.30s -> 20275.85s]  as if the pre-sale is over.
[20275.85s -> 20278.04s]  I would say as of now.
[20278.04s -> 20279.72s]  We are extending some stuff.
[20281.93s -> 20283.53s]  The posters and all that stuff
[20283.53s -> 20286.22s]  has been extended just by a little bit.
[20289.02s -> 20290.38s]  But you can operate as if,
[20290.38s -> 20292.14s]  I would say as if we're out of pre-sale.
[20293.55s -> 20295.15s]  I would say, yeah.
[20295.87s -> 20299.87s]  Now there is something that is going to happen
[20299.87s -> 20301.31s]  to be the official,
[20302.36s -> 20305.08s]  the official launch of the project.
[20306.94s -> 20308.14s]  You'll have to see what that is.
[20308.70s -> 20311.26s]  I'm not going to tell you anything else.
[20311.26s -> 20313.77s]  And it's fucking cool.
[20314.65s -> 20315.45s]  That's it.
[20315.45s -> 20325.74s]  I'm going to implode, yeah.
[20326.38s -> 20331.96s]  What time are you going to stream on Friday?
[20331.96s -> 20332.84s]  Probably around the same time.
[20332.84s -> 20334.20s]  Probably like 5, 6.
[20334.20s -> 20335.72s]  Just put 6 p.m. Pacific.
[20335.72s -> 20336.84s]  Easier that way.
[20336.84s -> 20338.04s]  It's going to be a really chill stream.
[20340.32s -> 20342.40s]  Cam's going off for another little while.
[20342.40s -> 20346.44s]  Going to relax, play some Breath of the Wild.
[20346.44s -> 20348.28s]  If you want to join us, please do.
[20348.84s -> 20351.26s]  Should be fun.
[20351.26s -> 20355.44s]  So that was Resident Evil 4.
[20355.44s -> 20357.52s]  And when the Mercenaries comes out,
[20358.64s -> 20360.08s]  I'm sure I'll play it.
[20360.08s -> 20366.27s]  For at least a couple of hours or something.
[20366.27s -> 20369.68s]  Very good.
[20369.68s -> 20370.64s]  Let me just quit out of this.
[20371.44s -> 20389.31s]  See you on Friday.
[20389.31s -> 20391.23s]  Are you ever going to play Sorcery ever again?
[20392.86s -> 20394.22s]  Let me get through Breath of the Wild
[20394.22s -> 20399.34s]  because I feel like the Breath of the Wild berries are...
[20400.57s -> 20402.09s]  They are starving.
[20404.70s -> 20407.50s]  So let's get through Breath of the Wild first.
[20408.06s -> 20413.87s]  What about House Flipper?
[20415.07s -> 20422.97s]  I don't know.
[20422.97s -> 20423.61s]  Probably not.
[20424.17s -> 20425.74s]  This is some new stuff.
[20426.38s -> 20434.32s]  Don't forget my birthday, please.
[20434.32s -> 20435.84s]  My Roblox birthday.
[20436.48s -> 20448.80s]  Would you ever do Stardew Valley again?
[20448.80s -> 20451.00s]  There's definitely a place for it
[20451.00s -> 20452.36s]  during one of these chiller streams.
[20454.80s -> 20455.52s]  Maybe one day.
[20463.76s -> 20465.29s]  But good night.
[20465.29s -> 20466.68s]  See you Friday.
[20466.68s -> 20468.52s]  Technically tomorrow for a lot of you.
[20470.86s -> 20471.66s]  Season.
[20471.66s -> 20474.94s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[20474.94s -> 20477.23s]  I'll see you on the weekend.
[20477.23s -> 20479.12s]  Or the start of the weekend.
[20479.12s -> 20481.56s]  Take it easy.
[20481.56s -> 20482.52s]  Call your mother.
[20482.52s -> 20483.79s]  Have a great day.
[20484.35s -> 20503.02s]  Goodbye.
