[0.76s -> 12.12s]  Good afternoon. How are you? Welcome to another live stream. I'll be your host for the evening.
[12.76s -> 21.18s]  So I listened to the radio the other day. And I didn't I was gonna bring this up yesterday,
[21.18s -> 30.23s]  but I forgot to. People that do radio, talk radio, they talk for probably five to 10 minutes.
[31.66s -> 37.94s]  And then there's five to 10 minutes of ads. They do like two to three hour long blocks.
[38.66s -> 44.39s]  And they actually only speak for about 40 minutes. I'm sitting there going, what the
[44.39s -> 54.02s]  fuck is this? And we're back. And sometimes sometimes they do the and we're back, speak
[54.02s -> 63.42s]  for 30 seconds, and then do 10 minutes of ads. That's a what the fuck is going on there.
[64.06s -> 71.11s]  That's unbelievable. I'm sitting there going, people on Twitch sit here and they broadcast
[71.11s -> 77.72s]  for like eight hours sometimes. Can you imagine if I every 10 minutes took a 10 minute ad break?
[78.36s -> 82.62s]  We would never get anything done. How does anybody on the radio get anything done?
[88.97s -> 91.85s]  Like when you get when you get into a conversation, you start really talking.
[94.01s -> 98.01s]  It takes longer than like six minutes to have a conversation. Like that's you can't have a
[98.01s -> 114.94s]  conversation six minutes. He hates ads. No, I don't hate ads. I kind of do. Who likes ads?
[116.15s -> 121.86s]  Nobody likes that. I'm just saying sitting there going, what if I ran a fucking commercial every
[121.86s -> 126.10s]  four minutes? And the commercial wasn't 30 seconds long. It was six minutes long.
[126.82s -> 132.84s]  You guys would run away. I didn't even give a fuck. I was supposed to. I got I got I was
[132.84s -> 138.23s]  I was gonna say Resident Evil three tonight. My tweet and I didn't do it. Here we go. I almost
[138.23s -> 148.44s]  hit send. People who run ads like ads. Yeah, I guess that's true. Because then that's you get
[148.44s -> 154.78s]  paid, I guess. I don't like the title. The title is dog shit. But what do you want me to title this?
[157.35s -> 165.35s]  I thought I'm like streamer number 450,000 that has played this guy. I don't got it. What do you
[165.35s -> 171.77s]  want me to do for a funny title? All the funny titles have been sapped. They've all been done.
[171.77s -> 186.01s]  You've already seen them all. E. I did write E. He's in the title. It's E. Resident E. Resident E.
[186.65s -> 202.41s]  How about just Resident E? Just E. Just title it E. All right, just E. Is that better?
[204.87s -> 216.39s]  Just E. All right, now I'm keeping I'm keeping it. We're gonna play Resident Evil three tonight.
[216.39s -> 230.54s]  Just E. I've been waiting for this for a long time. And yeah, I've been waiting for it. But it's I
[230.54s -> 237.19s]  I'm keeping my expectations pretty low. Because for every one person that says it's all right,
[237.19s -> 241.67s]  there's 100 people that say, don't play it. It's gonna ruin what you like about the second one.
[242.55s -> 246.39s]  So I'm gonna keep myself at a very, very I'm gonna be low energy tonight.
[247.35s -> 250.95s]  I'm gonna tie I'm gonna be dialed back low energy. I don't want to be fucking high energy
[250.95s -> 262.31s]  right now. Because what if I don't like it? Low energy. Oh, shit, I forgot to get my extender.
[262.31s -> 272.50s]  Hold on. Where's my extender? No, no, this is a big problem. Where's my extender? This is a major
[272.50s -> 280.71s]  problem. I can't start without this. I need my extension for my headphone. Oh, wait, this is bad.
[280.79s -> 290.70s]  It's bad. Why is it not plugged in? And where is it? You're going to understand why I need this?
[290.70s -> 306.36s]  Because it's going to build it all stream. Extender. Thank God. Stream saved. God, I would
[306.36s -> 312.73s]  have taken a fucking week off. All right, we got it. So we're gonna play sorry, I'm not hitting you
[312.73s -> 330.28s]  there. We're gonna play Resident Evil 3 remake. I think I'll stream for a little while. And the
[330.28s -> 333.72s]  goal, by the way, is to try to beat this in one stream. If I can't beat this in one stream within
[333.72s -> 344.23s]  the next six to seven hours, then I'll just YouTube the rest. All right, that's fine. That's
[344.23s -> 352.55s]  what that works. Good. Good. My extender is in. All right, let's go. Are you ready? I don't think
[352.55s -> 358.07s]  you guys are ready for Resident Evil 3. Did I hype you guys up? I mean, you've probably played
[358.07s -> 367.96s]  this game three times now. I haven't. All right, let's go. I know, I know, I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[367.96s -> 376.17s]  I know. It's a it's a fucking scary game. By the way, worst hair arc ever. It's I just have to
[376.17s -> 383.91s]  accept it. This is just worst hair arc. Every day is worst hair 2020. But as long as I stay like
[383.91s -> 393.45s]  this, I could I could look fine. Once I turn this way, you see the real damage. See the real damage
[393.45s -> 402.46s]  of this hair will just stay this way for now. All right, let's go. New game. Nope. Sorry, not
[402.46s -> 407.34s]  going to happen. Don't care. I'm not going to play on assisted. I'm going to play on standard. I'm
[407.34s -> 412.62s]  going to play regular mode. I know I get bullied into picking the hardest mode in every game.
[412.62s -> 415.42s]  That's not going to I'm not going to say I don't even know. I don't even know what it says.
[416.14s -> 431.24s]  I saw stronger enemies and no, I don't care. All right, everybody shut up. Cut scene. Is this real?
[433.98s -> 442.63s]  It's an FMV. Any disease in modern. Authorities are bracing for more.
[447.61s -> 453.21s]  What the what? A citywide emergency has been declared. The CDC has quarantined the lower
[453.29s -> 462.41s]  Midwestern. Why did that happen? Commitment, honesty, integrity. These are the core values
[462.41s -> 478.46s]  that Matt Corkus for umbrella. It's this foundation that will continue to build a brighter future for

[4202.70s -> 4217.78s]  fucking lock it in nine three now here's the problem i have to remember how to use a safe
[4222.25s -> 4231.00s]  so it's this way first you go nine then you pass the seven you do one full rotation land on seven
[4231.00s -> 4246.17s]  and then back to nine back to three back to three what what was the number nine three seven
[4246.81s -> 4272.49s]  what did i what did i do all right what did i do nine over three seven no no that's how you do it
[4272.49s -> 4277.10s]  that's how you use a safe don't do a full rotation that's how you that's how you open a safe
[4278.20s -> 4284.92s]  they wait are they away forgot this game there's a remake fucking like 16 to 20 year old crowd
[4284.92s -> 4288.44s]  don't even know what this is you've never seen a dial like this before why would they know that
[4289.00s -> 4302.78s]  yeah that's oh yeah that guys if you don't know you actually have to pass the second number in a
[4302.78s -> 4311.34s]  full rotation when you open a safe i get yeah it's a remake the red dot sight holy shit really
[4311.98s -> 4319.13s]  that's not wrong though that's that's actually true yeah that's how you open up a dial custom part for
[4319.13s -> 4340.14s]  the handgun is it on nice oh well there we go i got the first cool unlockable why does everyone
[4340.14s -> 4350.71s]  here hate when germa is right because the streamer always has to be wrong i could tell you that

[10357.90s -> 10365.46s]  i want to get rid of the fucking knife so bad i know it's probably i should get rid of the
[10365.46s -> 10375.43s]  dumb knife or this till i find a green herb
[10378.20s -> 10390.76s]  uh that's gonna come back to haunt me i know throwing that away
[10419.02s -> 10426.73s]  okay uh we're gonna play you respond to it the recoil we got the sewers map
[10427.37s -> 10442.39s]  let's find a way perfect okay let's go all right gotta go have fun thanks for sticking around
[10446.60s -> 10457.75s]  i why is there always have to be a sewer i hate sewer levels they really are the worst
[10458.31s -> 10486.18s]  nobody ever says oh boy a sewer level that's a little shortcut eventually a big um big slot
[10486.18s -> 10494.12s]  for something but looks like it needs a power source big power battery increased sewer security
[10494.76s -> 10498.42s]  we've been receiving reports of unauthorized personnel in the control areas of the facility
[10498.42s -> 10504.55s]  in response we're replacing the aging mechanical locks with new protocols we need a battery pack
[10505.19s -> 10511.61s]  they would be battery packs to open these doors where does that leave us that leaves us with going
[10511.61s -> 10530.22s]  at just down here now i'm gonna turn the light on in my room not off i'm definitely burning these
[10530.22s -> 10548.38s]  to be bugs down here probably right straight up some kind of animal animal bug hybrid
[10550.15s -> 10593.91s]  shotgun level okay so it's a shotgun level it's just a sewer alligator yes it is still have the
[10593.91s -> 10606.38s]  items oh no i'm good all right i got a battery pack before i fall down this nothing over here
[10606.38s -> 10614.90s]  i can't grab anything no it's just a goldfish that's just how big they get okay let's try this
[10614.90s -> 10628.36s]  again this time shotgun in the face is there a gun symbol on the ground over here oh hand grenade
[10629.16s -> 10657.85s]  oh let's go equip it all right yeah let's try it here we go too early how do you throw a grenade
[10657.85s -> 10667.22s]  too early it what do you mean it blew up the whole hallway there's two ways to go here
[10667.78s -> 10676.94s]  was to get the grenade in the mouth really oh whatever i'll remember that for next time
[10677.50s -> 10686.78s]  close to b combined with explosive thanks for the fucking tip i'm with explosive a to create
[10686.78s -> 10693.82s]  flame rounds or combine with another b to make acid rounds right they come in handy especially
[10693.82s -> 10699.90s]  when i hoard them all till the very last moment in the game and use every single round of acid spray
[10699.90s -> 10707.78s]  on the last boss oh just kidding i left it in the storage box i'm using the default handgun to end
[10707.78s -> 10727.37s]  the game ooh grenade launcher that's pretty sick hold on invoice from the gun shop thank you
[10727.37s -> 10736.28s]  purchasing the xxxxxx we're in the future this is welcome to what every graphics card is going to
[10736.28s -> 10746.49s]  have to start doing in like 200 years when we're on like generation 80 of nvidia gpus what are they
[10746.49s -> 10753.18s]  going to do start over at zero like a thousand times i think they're going to drop the numbers
[10753.18s -> 10757.58s]  in the names all together it's going to be it's going to go by year i don't know i'm actually
[10757.58s -> 10765.86s]  confused as to why they don't do that already like you know the nvidia g force 2020 like a car like
[10765.86s -> 10772.95s]  yeah i know what a g force 1995 is like i know what a car that's like you use cars why don't
[10772.95s -> 10778.63s]  they just call them by car name why i don't understand why do they have to add like rtx 2180
[10778.63s -> 10783.59s]  no no no just it's 2020 it's a fucking 2000 it's a bit things are not in great shape but it's all
[10783.59s -> 10790.60s]  right it's got a few miles on it it's a fucking like 2013 nvidia g force gonna get the kelly
[10790.60s -> 10802.70s]  blue blue book value god okay explosive resistance yeah i know how to do this only one graphics card
[10802.70s -> 10807.51s]  per year well no even if they didn't have one come up for like a couple years it would still
[10807.51s -> 10814.33s]  just be like the 2022 the nvidia g force 2022 they're gonna do that eventually they're gonna
[10814.33s -> 10825.54s]  get so sick of fucking naming shit uh do i bring this this is too big it's huge i feel like i might
[10825.54s -> 10841.67s]  need it though i'm gonna bring it yeah i'll bring it i got two heels uh ammo ammo lockpick and then
[10841.67s -> 10847.83s]  the super grenade launcher i have two rounds in it two flame rounds okay good to know hopefully
[10847.83s -> 10856.30s]  i don't accidentally use that research log which are the water and ph level is not that great
[10856.30s -> 10870.81s]  this might be something there's something in the water apparently all right let's go let's find a
[10870.81s -> 10884.65s]  way back out so what does this do for me i gotta go back to the split keep the shotgun out i want
[10884.65s -> 10904.41s]  to get these two killed it's gonna pop out one of these which hole is he gonna come out of that's
[10904.41s -> 10933.21s]  the guess none he's just gonna be down the hallway hey hey hey hey holy shit these guys suck real

[23768.25s -> 23816.41s]  whoa that was fucking scary that's apparently all i have to say about it i'm going to heal
[23816.41s -> 23833.70s]  now that was horrible let's go what about in this little container oh we do have some stuff in here
[23833.70s -> 23843.43s]  gunpowder gunpowder gunpowder gunpowder all right do i make a bunch of shotgun shells or do i have
[23843.43s -> 23866.06s]  like 30 to 40 rounds in the magnum what's your favorite flavor of gunpowder uh blue raspberry
[23866.06s -> 23903.80s]  okay there's two where's this last one it's one more blue raspberry sucks what's wrong with it
[23903.80s -> 23909.85s]  i'm just trying to look and see where the last one is in there okay down there i can go that
[23909.93s -> 23930.22s]  way maybe up there and around all right who's making that noise can i get in wait a minute
[23930.22s -> 23938.07s]  i go down i go this way does this connect it does yeah i remember this fucking weirdo um
[23938.87s -> 23952.33s]  i go down by this way first it could be like a right there right fucking there
[23952.97s -> 23965.05s]  i sneak by i press this button not yet wait okay i'm gonna climb down that they're gonna go that
[23965.05s -> 24009.46s]  way how do i get on that side wait can i oh this is door right here oh go go go where do you go i
[24009.46s -> 24029.02s]  don't even know which way it's fucked up we're doing our health i'm fine all right this is the
[24029.02s -> 24052.73s]  last one free fuses here goes time to put the power back on which is under there how do you like the
[24052.73s -> 24066.81s]  game so far i think it's good i think it's a good game watch out for this guy right i think it's
[24066.81s -> 24073.16s]  good do i think it's i mean i gotta be honest do i think it's even remotely close to the second
[24073.16s -> 24083.03s]  game remake it's it's fun to play it's a fun game but i don't think it's even even close to
[24083.03s -> 24094.28s]  uh re2 remake so far i mean if resident evil 2 remake was like a 9.6 for me like a 9.4 this is
[24094.28s -> 24106.34s]  probably this is probably like a this is probably like a seven one like it's still good it's still
[24106.34s -> 24119.27s]  i think it's still a good game i think it's still fair game what's missing um nemesis i feel like
[24119.27s -> 24125.27s]  he's kind of just showed up to because in the last game like he would kind of chase mr x would
[24125.27s -> 24130.41s]  chase you around and you'd get attacked and it was he was always a presence in this one he just kind
[24130.41s -> 24135.75s]  of a cutscene will happen he'll like grab you and then you kind of have to run away from him for a
[24135.75s -> 24141.72s]  few minutes it's like it's they like show their hand before he makes an appearance because before
[24141.72s -> 24144.92s]  mr x would just fucking show up like you'd be doing something he'd be on like the typewriter
[24144.92s -> 24149.24s]  you turn around he'd just be there it's like holy fuck that's the guy but this one it's like
[24149.24s -> 24158.36s]  cutscene i'm here and you're like oh he's here and then you have to run away from him i think if
[24158.36s -> 24164.15s]  nemesis was a little more interesting to have encounters with i would probably say this is
[24164.15s -> 24171.11s]  be up a little higher but and that's that's kind of in my opinion that's a huge point of the whole
[24171.11s -> 24176.31s]  game i think right i mean nemesis is the bad guy they use him too early yeah they like kind of really
[24177.03s -> 24187.03s]  here he is it's been like not even 20 minutes i don't think it's bad i just i prefer the other
[24187.03s -> 24193.11s]  style of like he could kind of just be anywhere versus the like big extravagant here's a cutscene
[24193.11s -> 24199.35s]  and now fight nemesis for a few minutes i mean i still haven't a great time seven one might be
[24199.35s -> 24205.24s]  unfair uh we'll find out we'll find we'll find it at the end of the game we'll find out we're
[24205.24s -> 24220.55s]  good we'll be there soon now i'm not gonna give this 64 all right let's head down here all right
[24220.55s -> 24246.26s]  you ready you need the magnum for this oh 64 saves all right i have a prediction the amount
[24246.26s -> 24252.66s]  of saves that the game is when the game is over is my score for the game i think that's fair
[24252.66s -> 24268.41s]  those of a gunpowder gunpowder so i want to make some shotgun shells eventually hopefully
[24268.41s -> 24277.40s]  i need the magnum right no just make some uh pistol round i'm gonna lose these three
[24277.40s -> 24286.97s]  magnum coming out take it with my magnum ammo take it out i got look at all these bullets it's
[24286.97s -> 24295.48s]  gonna be fucking insane okay now i put away the grenade launcher maybe i just don't need it i
[24295.48s -> 24313.08s]  don't need the grenade launcher put the handgun away yeah that make actually that makes sense
[24313.08s -> 24320.39s]  keep yeah the grenade launcher keep the magnum i'm gonna lose this we have to make uh okay yeah
[24320.39s -> 24325.43s]  yeah yeah yeah two heals let's take a third one just in case i'm fucking terrible at the video
[24325.51s -> 24344.34s]  game here comes the final boss incoming i think it's a 65 so far let's do it this time i'm not
[24344.34s -> 24372.57s]  gonna get hit by you oh come on you're dead nope why do you have to fucking have i could have just
[24372.57s -> 24410.07s]  put the stupid um turn it on pursuit oh go go go go hit the button hit the button i got my magnum
[24410.07s -> 24422.26s]  out don't fire the magnum put the magnum away it's talking up shit he got away what was he doing in
[24422.26s -> 24460.90s]  here it's time unfinished activity log s run at university uh they gave it a 64 god eyes on two
[24460.90s -> 24466.87s]  stars a male infected in a female bioweapon is pursuing the female metamorphosis in the
[24466.87s -> 24471.91s]  bioweapon triggered by a hostile encounter with jv video attached baby's been infected
[24471.91s -> 24477.98s]  and his non-responsive collected samples per orders vaccine recovered and administered to jv
[24477.98s -> 24484.46s]  by co a soldier in mv platoon jv expected to be fit for combat approximately in 20 hours
[24484.46s -> 24491.22s]  seems clear the bioweapon is project n contact with jv causes to change and evolve will induce
[24491.22s -> 24502.74s]  further encounters to obtain more data jv germ of venus that face when your twitch email doesn't work
[24511.27s -> 24513.19s]  through they're willing to negotiate
[24515.59s -> 24522.74s]  they'll call off the strike gif and this is one big ass if we can deliver the vaccine to them
[24524.14s -> 24532.54s]  before they launch how long do we have hours maybe shut that last time waste one more second
[24532.54s -> 24542.36s]  this way everyone always says hours hours hours this was hours ago we'll find the vaccine up ahead
[24543.08s -> 24562.10s]  go back what oh shit he's going without me with the loot oh fuck good thing i turned around
[24562.18s -> 24570.82s]  and the barrel the magnum reduces recoil and extra speed increases damage
[24570.82s -> 24574.50s]  holy shit imagine if i didn't get the damage upgrade to the magnum
[24576.55s -> 24584.06s]  holy shit that would have been awful okay now i'm gonna this is gonna be i'm gonna shoot the guy
[24584.06s -> 24595.43s]  four times and kill him what if germa became a landlord i don't know what i'd probably i'd
[24595.43s -> 24600.73s]  fucking have fair prices what i would have i would have a fair price what are you talking about
[24601.21s -> 24616.65s]  i mean true stop and do what i got your back will you go forward all right let's get this done
[24616.65s -> 24620.33s]  you go first i played the thing for 12 straight hours man i know how this works go
[24621.29s -> 24673.18s]  i'm not gonna have this happen he's going to bite you there he is bro do i control this
[24674.38s -> 24683.32s]  all right so i'm gonna give you a case in point why not just have him show up through the hallway
[24683.32s -> 24686.12s]  and it's like oh fucking he kills the guy you're gonna mean like in game
[24686.92s -> 24694.10s]  don't need a cutscene for everything that was a very fast door yeah i would be scared to even
[24694.10s -> 24712.63s]  walk through this in normal circumstances sterile just stand up uh i need to open this somehow
[24713.19s -> 24724.78s]  i don't have anything save why any items in here shelf yes all right good now i can make
[24724.78s -> 24734.71s]  shotgun shells employee regulations attention nest two employees objective of the t-virus
[24734.71s -> 24739.51s]  research facility differ from those of the umbrellas main nest facility here we focus on
[24739.51s -> 24745.35s]  real world use cases which arise as new bio weapons are created and introduced such as the need for a
[24745.35s -> 24749.83s]  t-virus vaccine somebody else to read it the mass books of our work can be dangerous it's imperative
[24749.83s -> 24753.67s]  that all employees adhere to workplace regulations without fail somebody else will read this it's a
[24753.67s -> 24758.47s]  great honor to be a part of the finest research organizations in the world and we'll keep in mind
[24758.47s -> 24781.27s]  we stick to our rules any other items in here computer green herb okay uh should i just make
[24781.27s -> 24790.15s]  two green herbs how am i doing on health i'm actually okay not great but not bad not good
[24790.15s -> 24807.14s]  but not great will carry two with us reload this thing free reddit joke i made a joke
[24807.94s -> 24811.72s]  but what did i say i'm not i'm not even aware of what i did that what did i do
[24815.91s -> 24820.39s]  i didn't i'm not even aware that i'm doing it this is landlords in chat with dan's game
[24822.46s -> 24849.48s]  landlords in chat all right i'm good so need to find uh what this way all right workers break lab
[24849.48s -> 24858.62s]  one let's go this way first you're gonna get up aren't you not oh shit am i i'm supposed to open
[24861.42s -> 24873.27s]  had to open that box isaac's diary hey was generous the benefits were good somebody else will read
[24873.27s -> 24879.19s]  this well hindsight is 2020 because this lab is a den of monsters who couldn't there are barbarians
[24879.19s -> 24883.19s]  in here it's messed up the world needs to know umbrella owns this town there was this guy they
[24883.19s -> 24887.67s]  caught trying to smuggle out company secrets they essentially fed him to one of the betas
[24888.47s -> 24906.26s]  bed him i saw the whole thing fucked up should have brought the handgun i tried to dodge too
[24907.86s -> 24921.40s]  this is broken this is broken this is broken what the fuck was that it was a big grunt
[24930.23s -> 24945.37s]  oh more i can make more shotgun shells it's a happy happy day and gonna emo yeah it's a people
[24945.37s -> 24953.08s]  happy day oh shit we're going late huh i just looked at the time to begin vaccine synthesis
[24953.56s -> 24960.79s]  place the materials in the chamber hey shit it's been a long time i don't have i need vaccine
[24960.79s -> 24969.93s]  materials synthesis i have to make it myself all right that's dumb okay here we go uh the most
[24969.93s -> 24982.07s]  efficiently synthesized okay you need an antigen and an adjuvant sure go get two items and put it
[24982.07s -> 24997.88s]  in this box got it override key successfully generated what if we hear what is that override
[24997.88s -> 25021.80s]  key removed flash drive what do i pick up what head this way nothing else on the tables or anything
[25026.06s -> 25042.62s]  no let's go into the lab over here uh wait down stairs tension streamer it's time to stretch
[25042.62s -> 25054.65s]  don't worry i will let me go back down here but you guys what flash drive that's right
[25056.15s -> 25063.46s]  wait flash drive uh what what what year is this isn't it like 1997 or something
[25068.15s -> 25074.07s]  i see i'm under there i didn't why i shoot the shotgun okay i have to kill these guys with
[25074.07s -> 25078.15s]  the magnum you say right i might i don't want to waste up there's so many they're so valuable
[25082.95s -> 25108.30s]  make a count his head's moving around too much got him fucking asshole okay
[25109.99s -> 25123.24s]  they're dead oh my health is at zero what a bunch of bullshit all right no more of those all right
[25123.24s -> 25133.48s]  i think notice hazard materials take extreme care there's a fucking there's item one here
[25133.80s -> 25166.07s]  there's item number one you need here here what's that bye bye was it uh bye bye supposed to a
[25170.60s -> 25190.04s]  that's it huh all right a dying message from the scientist the virus is leaked prepared a culture
[25190.04s -> 25203.14s]  of the antigen yes where the adjuvant samples are stored in the incubation lab where the hell
[25203.14s -> 25226.74s]  is that top maybe oh acid rounds fun powder laptop wait i missed what i missed in the corner
[25227.46s -> 25241.53s]  yes i'm running out of space let me reload this thing here we go you gotta find the hev suit all
[25241.53s -> 25272.47s]  right inventory looks like shit i gotta fix this better hey uh here's the heels all right that's
[25272.55s -> 25285.72s]  fine oh this thing's tangled them they're waiting for you jeremy in the test chambers
[25286.52s -> 25302.60s]  or they are this must be what powers it yes this is what oops oh he was the fucking guy that was
[25302.60s -> 25324.52s]  gonna tell me how to do this i'm oh it's really easy yeah you had a really kind of shitty quest

[25355.11s -> 25379.10s]  out the this thing because i don't feel safe in this one okay i gotta ask why put that in a
[25379.10s -> 25387.42s]  briefcase this big you could very easily just put that in like a fucking small jar somebody had to
[25387.42s -> 25395.83s]  place that right in the middle like a weirdo and close this why not put like 50 of them in here
[25396.47s -> 25410.44s]  why just one i think i'll place one bottle of tylenol inside of the center of this fucking box
[25411.08s -> 25417.19s]  we're scientists i don't know for what reason do i am i doing this there's just like an office
[25417.19s -> 25422.70s]  weirdo that's in every one of these games that just particularly places fucking shit everywhere
[25422.70s -> 25428.78s]  in random spots there's no reason for that to be there why is that there there's no fucking reason
[25428.78s -> 25449.22s]  why that box is on that table the video games now it's not just real man this is me anything
[25449.22s -> 25458.87s]  on this table that was a reddit youtube bit uh youtube has 700 trillion videos and reddit has
[25458.87s -> 25464.95s]  like 900 000 a post a second so uh yeah i guess it could have been on fucking reddit one day
[25465.91s -> 25489.94s]  oh this is bad give me a shot to fucking shoot no restart the whole game what the fuck

[25659.26s -> 25661.90s]  these are combined with antigens to increase immune system response
[25688.95s -> 25695.24s]  i have concerns about this virus that you're making you're making a virus viruses can be
[25695.24s -> 25700.12s]  kept in check i believe an effective vaccine can be developed do you know the name for parasites
[25700.12s -> 25707.08s]  however perhaps in your country consumers are willing to buy them sincerely we have a problem
[25707.08s -> 25718.12s]  we've fucked up so it's a missus you've already read it i i i got it i gotta pick that up i have

[25892.41s -> 25900.68s]  sterilization room where am i trying to go here which for an antigen ducked up bro how close you
[25900.68s -> 25911.34s]  to beating the game up very very close very close this is i believe the last area from what i
[25911.34s -> 25920.98s]  remember of playing the original game from what i remember this is the last area one of we're very
[25920.98s -> 25938.42s]  close to got them both ultra sample an antigen sample i'll definitely need this weaponry
[25938.42s -> 25943.53s]  authorization request i'd like to formally request that the weaponry normally reserved for the
[25943.53s -> 25949.29s]  bioweapon synthesis team be made available to any employee uh reasonably some test subjects
[25949.29s -> 25953.53s]  have developed a new mutation granted them very high regrowth abilities our team referring to
[25953.53s -> 25972.86s]  these specimens as pale heads you need to kill them with a big magnum thanks chat okay now we go
[25972.86s -> 25988.18s]  down here this is the we go down this way remember it's your mother go to bed now how do i get in

[27958.71s -> 27970.89s]  why would you need to shoot from that far away why did you do it there's a price tag for everything
[27971.69s -> 27982.18s]  even letting the world burn who are you working for i'll tell you if you get me out of here
[27982.18s -> 28009.02s]  i'll pay you whatever you want wait didn't i shoot him in the head

[28027.22s -> 28040.58s]  chill did i win there it is good thing we're in a plane because it missed us
[28044.65s -> 28052.60s]  no way no wait is that how it ends oh i thought it was the helicopter got hit with the missile
[28062.04s -> 28069.48s]  oh it did happen technically it technically happened we got hit by the blast technically
[28073.56s -> 28090.78s]  wait the city got destroyed finally over how is that a good ending so long i felt empty and cold
[28090.78s -> 28098.62s]  as the heat from the blast washed over us all this death wasn't caused by a monster making virus
[28098.70s -> 28114.50s]  this human greed i decided made by man is a raccoon city would be umbrellas ashes too
[28115.46s -> 28127.80s]  i would end them once and for all it was man oh that is the end biggest villain of them all
[28129.40s -> 28143.56s]  mankind and monsters is there after the credits thing it was greed no no no it was greed it was
[28144.04s -> 28160.20s]  greed actually oh sorry what the game get how many saves was it 74 it is 74 that's perfect i think
[28160.20s -> 28184.41s]  remember i told you i thought it might be a little low at 71 74 much acid go to sleep i will i will
[28187.83s -> 28192.87s]  it was still a quality experience but wasn't even close to the second one and i know that
[28192.87s -> 28199.11s]  completely different games but they are made in the same vein they released within a couple
[28199.19s -> 28203.43s]  years of each other and they're ones a direct sequel to the other one and they're both remakes
[28207.50s -> 28213.19s]  i think nemesis was done very poorly i'll just be honest i think every time nemesis shows up you
[28213.19s -> 28218.60s]  don't have to give me a cut scene i think it's more fun if he just kind of scares you even near
[28218.60s -> 28222.76s]  the end there was a lot of cases where nemesis just kind of could have just broken a wall down
[28222.76s -> 28228.52s]  as the big guy or i don't know there was a cut scene for everything that's really the only
[28228.52s -> 28236.33s]  complaint i have that's it and that's enough to bring it down a lot for me the game was fun the
[28236.33s -> 28240.49s]  actual the video game was still just as good and just as fun and just as interesting as the last
[28240.49s -> 28247.59s]  one but i just i think there's just a little too much on the uh kind of showing your hand before
[28247.59s -> 28255.83s]  you put it down what the writing yeah but they're all kind of like that though they're all cheesy
[28256.47s -> 28267.24s]  i'm still happy i played it i still think it was worth playing absolutely but i don't know if i
[28267.24s -> 28273.93s]  would put this in the category of wow if i put this in the category of yeah that was worth it
[28281.86s -> 28299.98s]  it's no animal crossing no it's not it's animal crossing now you're gonna do the final fantasy
[28299.98s -> 28311.32s]  seven remake i'm not sure about that what would i say is a fair price for the game that's hard to
[28312.28s -> 28321.22s]  give you an answer for that because this did feel like sort of an extended campaign from the second
[28321.22s -> 28333.13s]  game like if you said this was resident evil 2 a full like actual five plus hour dlc campaign
[28333.13s -> 28341.11s]  and it's like it's just the third game and it was oh hey by the way resident evil 3 dlc it's kind
[28341.11s -> 28346.84s]  of i guess it felt like it a little bit i don't i don't i think 20 i think 30 dollars would be
[28346.84s -> 28365.72s]  no that's too that's too cheap 29 99 no no no no i don't know about that it's just 60 dollars
[28365.72s -> 28370.52s]  some games are four hours some games you can beat it you can go back and play over and over again
[28371.56s -> 28375.56s]  can't really i mean it's a triple a game that releases they're all going to be 60 bucks
[28376.52s -> 28397.83s]  20 or less it's a remake though yeah but it's not like it's a code of paint it's a it's a full
[28397.83s -> 28405.88s]  completely done video game that it's not like they just put it in hd textures it's a complete
[28405.88s -> 28414.98s]  remake of the entire game and i played the resident evil 1 remake i did not
[28415.70s -> 28426.87s]  that's from the ground up um no i mean i think i think it was worth playing but it's hard to
[28426.95s -> 28431.27s]  stand them both next to each other when this one is number three and the last one is number two
[28431.27s -> 28436.95s]  and number two was way more fun that's why it's hard to kind of score this because i just
[28436.95s -> 28443.35s]  experienced like a year and a half ago two years ago uh like the one before this and this is the
[28443.35s -> 28448.55s]  one directly after it so it's kind of hard not to be like oh well this would figure maybe the
[28448.55s -> 28453.91s]  three they learned some stuff from two and everybody fucking loved it maybe they'll make
[28453.99s -> 28458.15s]  three just a better two it'll be just better but it feels like a step backwards instead of a step
[28458.15s -> 28474.07s]  forward that's why it's 74 only been a year yeah zero post credits to find out but we gotta go
[28476.58s -> 28494.73s]  i i've completely ruined every rule i've ever made uh the bits i'm gonna i'll do the bits tomorrow
