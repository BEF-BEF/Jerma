[2.04s -> 15.43s]  Listen to that sound, listen to that sound, listen to this sound. It should. PS2 Slim. Okay, yeah, let's do it.
[15.43s -> 23.31s]  So this was a guitar stream that had a coliseum in the middle.
[23.31s -> 30.05s]  Let's do this. This is gonna be called Strummin' Along.
[30.05s -> 46.18s]  Um, Jammer, Lammy. Did it work? Let's make sure it works first. Reading disc. Is it gonna work?
[46.18s -> 62.70s]  PlayStation. Alright. Strummin' Along. Um, Jammer, Lammy. Let's do it. Does it work? Come on, work.
[62.80s -> 73.71s]  I don't have a PS1 memory card in here. Does that matter? I mean, this game's only like an hour and a half long, isn't it?
[73.71s -> 78.02s]  Like, I'm... It's not like it's gonna be a problem. I'm gonna beat it now.
[96.20s -> 101.20s]  This is made by the Rappa the Rappa Design Studio team.
[103.20s -> 106.40s]  Don't cry about this. No, I will not.
[106.90s -> 114.06s]  That sure was fun. Part one was good too, but this one had more juice.
[115.06s -> 118.52s]  Wait, was that Beaker?
[118.52s -> 121.52s]  What's wrong, Lammy? You seem down.
[121.52s -> 124.52s]  Oh, I wish I was that strong.
[124.52s -> 132.52s]  Lammy, you're already strong as is. You should be more confident. Nobody beats Lammy when she's on the guitar.
[134.52s -> 135.52s]  Guitar stream.
[135.52s -> 137.52s]  But that is the truth.
[137.52s -> 139.52s]  Guitar warrior!
[140.02s -> 149.02s]  We are milk cans. With my son's beats, Lammy's guitar, and my almighty bass combined with that distinguished voice, there's nothing to be afraid of.
[149.02s -> 152.65s]  Square!
[152.65s -> 153.65s]  Yeah!
[153.65s -> 159.09s]  We're lunches for everyone, right?
[159.09s -> 161.09s]  Hey, that's ours. That's our food.
[161.09s -> 172.11s]  Not only lunches, but a little babe. All dressed up for us. Ain't that right?
[172.11s -> 173.11s]  Here.
[174.74s -> 177.42s]  Let's do that around the whole earth.
[177.92s -> 189.51s]  See? The guitar rules again.
[191.51s -> 201.00s]  Let's go.
[214.06s -> 216.06s]  Gotta take it like a stage select.
[216.06s -> 220.06s]  Gotta make sure load and save, replay, mechanism replay, high score options.
[220.06s -> 222.06s]  Let's check it out.
[222.06s -> 224.06s]  Turn off the vibration subtitles.
[224.06s -> 226.06s]  What happened to this?
[226.06s -> 231.84s]  Oh, okay, first I'm like, wait, how do you get bites in the middle?
[231.84s -> 235.87s]  Level normal.
[235.87s -> 244.75s]  Alright, let's do it.
[244.75s -> 246.75s]  New game.
[249.98s -> 254.34s]  It's not easy.
[254.34s -> 257.34s]  Easy? We thought the bite was on the normal.
[257.34s -> 261.94s]  What should I tell them?
[261.94s -> 265.94s]  I had a stomach ache, so I went to the b-b-bathroom.
[265.94s -> 271.94s]  But there was a long line at the gas station.
[271.94s -> 275.94s]  I told them it was an emergency, but they said,
[276.44s -> 278.44s]  Let's rap for it.
[280.44s -> 288.12s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[288.12s -> 289.12s]  Good.
[289.12s -> 293.16s]  Does this go?
[293.16s -> 295.16s]  Who's that?
[295.16s -> 309.30s]  And here's our best choc choc here.
[309.30s -> 317.25s]  Oh, this is like the third game. I forgot to tell you this.
[317.25s -> 321.25s]  This is, Parappa the Rapper comes up, Parappa the Rapper 2, and then I'm Jammer Lang.
[321.25s -> 323.25s]  Just in case you want to know.
[323.25s -> 325.25s]  You're supposed to know who this is.
[325.25s -> 333.04s]  Let's go.
[333.54s -> 337.06s]  Oh, it's up top. It's up top.
[337.06s -> 339.06s]  Watch this.
[339.06s -> 341.06s]  Oh, fuck.
[341.06s -> 343.88s]  Alright, I'll shut up.
[343.88s -> 346.63s]  Never get cool on easy.
[346.63s -> 379.13s]  What are you targeting on?
[379.13s -> 394.17s]  Is L like an L? Which L?
[394.17s -> 405.03s]  There's two L's.
[405.03s -> 422.44s]  There's two L's.
[422.44s -> 425.19s]  Oh, shit.
[425.19s -> 430.31s]  Oh, shit.
[430.31s -> 432.68s]  Oh, shit.
[432.68s -> 434.68s]  Oh, shit.
[435.42s -> 440.48s]  There's two L's.
[459.69s -> 463.69s]  When you see L, I don't know if it was left on the D pad or L.
[470.52s -> 474.74s]  What, it was vacuum cleaned the whole time?
[474.74s -> 478.71s]  What the what?
[481.27s -> 483.27s]  Yeah, L2 didn't exist.
[484.27s -> 488.30s]  Listen.
[488.30s -> 490.30s]  I lost my dojo.
[490.30s -> 492.30s]  I didn't get the bad one.
[492.30s -> 494.30s]  But the dojo remains in my mind.
[494.30s -> 496.60s]  It even has a casino.
[496.60s -> 498.60s]  Dojo. Casino.
[498.60s -> 501.23s]  That's all in my mind.
[501.23s -> 503.23s]  I have nothing to lose.
[505.23s -> 509.71s]  Wait, L2 and R2 did exist.
[509.71s -> 516.68s]  Did they?
[516.68s -> 519.50s]  Back in PlayStation 1?
[519.50s -> 522.25s]  I remember them existing.
[522.25s -> 524.49s]  They did?
[524.49s -> 526.49s]  I have a PlayStation 1 controller literally behind me.
[526.49s -> 528.49s]  Let me check.
[528.49s -> 539.76s]  Why didn't I just plug that in?
[539.76s -> 541.76s]  Wait, I've had this. Wait, wait, wait.
[541.76s -> 544.32s]  Hold on. Could I have used this?
[544.32s -> 546.32s]  For Guitar-O-Man?
[546.32s -> 549.77s]  No, I couldn't have, right? It's not the same.
[549.77s -> 569.36s]  No, it's not the same input.
[569.36s -> 579.40s]  No, it's not, is it?
[579.40s -> 581.40s]  It is.
[581.40s -> 584.99s]  Oh, my fucking god.
[584.99s -> 586.99s]  This is an official PlayStation 1 controller.
[586.99s -> 588.99s]  I have an official PlayStation 1 controller in my hand.
[588.99s -> 597.31s]  PS1 doesn't have analog sticks.
[597.31s -> 599.31s]  This one does.
[599.31s -> 601.31s]  And they feel great.
[608.35s -> 610.35s]  I had one.
[610.35s -> 612.35s]  I had one right behind me.
[616.35s -> 618.35s]  I'm so infuriated.
[618.35s -> 620.35s]  I'm going back to Guitar-O-Man after this.
[623.68s -> 625.68s]  What happened to the Rome game?
[625.68s -> 634.96s]  This thing feels so much better.
[634.96s -> 636.96s]  Fucking hell, I have this.
[641.37s -> 643.37s]  Whoa, whoa.
[643.37s -> 663.47s]  Watch the electricity to the water.
[663.47s -> 666.46s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[674.96s -> 677.39s]  What's going on?
[679.39s -> 686.49s]  What?
[686.49s -> 689.56s]  Are you preventing us from...
[689.56s -> 706.72s]  Casino!
[708.72s -> 714.09s]  Is this a random person?
[716.78s -> 723.68s]  Let's go.
[725.68s -> 727.68s]  Everyone's gone crazy.
[747.80s -> 758.49s]  Gotta give it double sometimes.
[769.44s -> 773.98s]  Fuck.
[828.19s -> 831.45s]  Oh, that was a little better.
[831.45s -> 833.45s]  Freestyle, freestyle, here it comes.
[858.40s -> 860.40s]  Oh!
[860.40s -> 862.76s]  Freestyle!
[862.76s -> 919.40s]  Dude, you guys are throwing freestyles, aren't you guys?
[919.40s -> 931.63s]  High score.
[931.63s -> 944.94s]  The second I put a fucking real controller in my hands...
[946.94s -> 948.94s]  Come on. Do the math.
[948.94s -> 951.44s]  Oh, not that pizza.
[966.94s -> 968.94s]  Flanger?
[975.92s -> 979.05s]  What?
[979.05s -> 982.44s]  Why is this happening?
[994.28s -> 996.28s]  Wait, hold on a minute.
[996.28s -> 998.28s]  Hold on a second.
[998.28s -> 1000.28s]  What?
[1000.28s -> 1002.28s]  What is going on?
[1002.28s -> 1004.28s]  I don't remember this.
[1004.28s -> 1006.28s]  She's pregnant?
[1006.28s -> 1008.72s]  I don't...
[1008.72s -> 1010.72s]  What?
[1012.72s -> 1014.72s]  What?
[1018.72s -> 1020.72s]  No.
[1020.72s -> 1022.72s]  Oh my.
[1022.72s -> 1027.26s]  Are you in labor?
[1027.26s -> 1029.26s]  You don't need to worry anymore.
[1029.26s -> 1031.26s]  Get away from me.
[1043.95s -> 1045.95s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1051.07s -> 1062.40s]  Is this what it sounds like? I feel like I make this noise.
[1062.40s -> 1064.40s]  I feel like I do this when I talk sometimes.
[1064.40s -> 1066.40s]  Is this what it sounds like?
[1068.40s -> 1089.10s]  I know.
[1089.10s -> 1097.15s]  Stop.
[1097.15s -> 1101.18s]  Disc scratch.
[1101.18s -> 1110.25s]  What happened?
[1110.25s -> 1112.25s]  I'm so confused.
[1112.25s -> 1123.12s]  Jesus.
[1123.12s -> 1125.12s]  I think something's wrong with
[1125.12s -> 1135.60s]  the disc.
[1135.60s -> 1137.60s]  I'm trying not to laugh that
[1137.60s -> 1139.60s]  hard because I'm having issues.
[1139.60s -> 1142.28s]  And
[1142.28s -> 1144.28s]  that was really difficult to not.
[1144.28s -> 1146.46s]  The disc is no longer spinning.
[1146.46s -> 1150.94s]  The disc is clean.
[1150.94s -> 1156.83s]  What's fucking going on?
[1156.83s -> 1158.83s]  Go back to the Rome
[1158.83s -> 1165.10s]  game.
[1165.10s -> 1171.29s]  This thing has damage?
[1171.29s -> 1173.29s]  There's no damage on
[1173.29s -> 1175.29s]  here. I'm just trying to buff it out.
[1175.29s -> 1179.84s]  It might pick up right where it left off.
[1179.84s -> 1189.24s]  And I don't have a save either.
[1189.24s -> 1192.68s]  Shit. No, I want to play
[1192.68s -> 1197.02s]  this. Come on.
[1197.02s -> 1199.02s]  No.
[1199.02s -> 1210.20s]  Why?
[1210.20s -> 1212.20s]  Yeah, I have to restart it.
[1212.20s -> 1214.20s]  It's all right. I can get through those first. I want to play this.
[1214.20s -> 1221.88s]  This is fun. The PS2 is bricked.
[1221.88s -> 1223.88s]  No, it's not. Wait, can I go
[1223.88s -> 1226.12s]  into the browser?
[1226.12s -> 1228.12s]  Maybe it's something to do with the speed. Hold on a
[1228.12s -> 1233.24s]  second. Can't you do
[1233.24s -> 1235.48s]  something in the config file
[1235.48s -> 1237.48s]  and make it so it doesn't, like it spins the
[1237.48s -> 1239.48s]  PS, does something better?
[1239.48s -> 1241.48s]  It works harder or something?
[1241.48s -> 1246.97s]  Let me, I want to see. Is it
[1246.97s -> 1252.41s]  in here? No, no.
[1252.41s -> 1257.72s]  What am I doing? No, it's
[1257.72s -> 1262.97s]  not here. No, never mind. All right, let's try
[1262.97s -> 1270.51s]  it again.
[1270.51s -> 1274.60s]  Oh, man. That seriously
[1274.60s -> 1276.60s]  hurt my, yeah, it's not here.
[1276.60s -> 1278.60s]  I think it's just on automatically.
[1278.60s -> 1282.51s]  Well, I
[1282.51s -> 1284.51s]  have nothing really to say about what just happened. That was
[1284.51s -> 1287.39s]  that was fucking
[1287.39s -> 1292.76s]  bizarre. Is this even going to
[1292.76s -> 1295.90s]  read the disk now? Okay.
[1295.90s -> 1304.67s]  So we're going to skip that cutscene
[1304.67s -> 1306.67s]  when we get there. First of all, I'm going to destroy the first
[1306.67s -> 1314.86s]  two levels, you'll see.
[1314.86s -> 1316.86s]  Thank you, modest narcissist.
[1316.86s -> 1320.25s]  Modest narcissist for the
[1320.25s -> 1322.25s]  10th period of substance. Thank you.
[1324.67s -> 1328.32s]  But in the event that
[1328.32s -> 1330.32s]  that happens again.
[1330.32s -> 1332.32s]  Wait one second.
[1332.32s -> 1334.32s]  I'm getting the
[1334.32s -> 1350.76s]  up shit.
[1350.76s -> 1356.01s]  Really?
[1356.01s -> 1358.01s]  It's like another, I have to go. I'm going to skip
[1358.01s -> 1360.01s]  through the cutscenes.
[1362.01s -> 1367.39s]  Let's go.
[1367.39s -> 1370.33s]  Okay.
[1376.76s -> 1378.76s]  See if I can get cool on this one.
[1380.76s -> 1383.71s]  Isn't there a level select?
[1383.71s -> 1385.71s]  There is, but do you have to unlock them first?
[1385.71s -> 1390.43s]  Hold on.
[1398.49s -> 1401.37s]  I'll have to go back here and show you.
[1401.37s -> 1404.25s]  I don't have to do this again, do I? It's on normal.
[1404.25s -> 1406.81s]  Look. Vibration off.
[1406.81s -> 1408.81s]  Subtitles on normal.
[1408.81s -> 1411.31s]  Stage select.
[1411.31s -> 1414.04s]  Yeah, I can't.
[1414.04s -> 1423.39s]  Alright, let's go. Skip the
[1423.39s -> 1425.39s]  cutscenes so they don't break.
[1425.39s -> 1434.73s]  I have no idea where that is.
[1434.73s -> 1436.73s]  The last time I did an actual
[1436.73s -> 1438.73s]  PlayStation 1 stream
[1438.73s -> 1440.73s]  was like a year
[1440.73s -> 1442.73s]  and a half ago. It's somewhere in the
[1442.73s -> 1444.73s]  blocks.
[1448.73s -> 1450.73s]  Alright, let's get cool here.
[1455.04s -> 1483.64s]  Skyhide.
[1496.17s -> 1498.17s]  Skyhide.
[1535.87s -> 1541.37s]  No!
[1568.14s -> 1570.51s]  Come on!
[1570.51s -> 1573.64s]  Why?
[1573.64s -> 1575.64s]  Look what you are holding in your hand.
[1575.64s -> 1577.64s]  I don't know.
[1577.64s -> 1580.08s]  What is it?
[1580.08s -> 1582.08s]  I'll get the next one. The next one's a good one. I want to get the next one again anyway.
[1582.08s -> 1584.08s]  So it doesn't matter.
[1586.08s -> 1588.08s]  Save the game. Save the game. Save the game. Save the game.
[1588.08s -> 1590.08s]  Save the game. Save the game. Save the game. Save the game.
[1590.08s -> 1592.08s]  I can't.
[1592.08s -> 1594.08s]  I can't do it. I have a PlayStation 2
[1594.08s -> 1600.60s]  memory card. See?
[1600.60s -> 1602.60s]  I can't do it.
[1602.60s -> 1604.60s]  My PlayStation 1 memory card's like
[1604.60s -> 1606.60s]  buried somewhere.
[1606.60s -> 1610.56s]  I'll be fine. Postmates it.
[1610.56s -> 1612.56s]  No!
[1612.56s -> 1614.92s]  Go find it.
[1614.92s -> 1621.31s]  Watch this cutscene
[1621.31s -> 1623.61s]  while I look.
[1646.91s -> 1660.20s]  Got it.
[1660.20s -> 1662.20s]  I'm putting it into slot one. No, I'm not going to touch. Yes I am.
[1664.20s -> 1666.64s]  Slot one.
[1666.64s -> 1668.64s]  I now have a PlayStation 1 memory card in there.
[1668.64s -> 1670.64s]  Oh, I remember this song.
[1670.64s -> 1672.64s]  It's like great.
[1682.46s -> 1684.46s]  How is that bad?
[1708.20s -> 1710.20s]  What the fuck?
[1762.91s -> 1765.79s]  What the fuck? I did it last time.
[1767.79s -> 1776.43s]  What the fuck?
[1796.80s -> 1798.80s]  Rock out!
[1804.80s -> 1814.19s]  Come on! Give me some points!
[1814.19s -> 1837.42s]  Your expression changes.
[1837.42s -> 1840.75s]  That's terrifying.
[1842.75s -> 1858.35s]  Why are you doing this?
[1860.35s -> 1873.66s]  Please!
[1873.66s -> 1876.67s]  What?
[1876.67s -> 1888.24s]  CD's in my hand.
[1888.24s -> 1890.24s]  CD's in my hand.
[1890.24s -> 1892.24s]  CD's in my hand.
[1914.51s -> 1927.42s]  Well, alright.
[1927.42s -> 1930.94s]  What's wrong with this thing?
[1930.94s -> 1938.88s]  It looks fine.
[1944.25s -> 1955.18s]  Uh oh.
[1955.18s -> 1963.18s]  I think our fun's over.
[1963.18s -> 1966.32s]  Plug in the PS1.
[1966.32s -> 1974.30s]  What? Again?
[1974.30s -> 1976.30s]  Again?
[2028.49s -> 2030.49s]  No!
[2048.51s -> 2058.75s]  Free style. Come on.
[2076.57s -> 2078.57s]  There it goes.
[2091.07s -> 2107.26s]  Oh fuck, I just was spamming.
[2107.26s -> 2109.44s]  I can't do anything.
[2114.25s -> 2128.97s]  There's a 3000 IQ play here, guys.
[2130.97s -> 2135.58s]  3000 IQ play here.
[2135.58s -> 2140.76s]  I did that.
[2140.76s -> 2142.76s]  Because I wanted to get rid of the
[2142.76s -> 2144.76s]  opportunity for it to crash during
[2144.76s -> 2146.76s]  the actual game.
[2146.76s -> 2148.76s]  What?
[2152.86s -> 2154.86s]  Only 3000 IQ?
[2154.86s -> 2156.86s]  That's pretty good.
[2156.86s -> 2158.86s]  For a god.
[2158.86s -> 2160.86s]  For a being that is just
[2160.86s -> 2162.86s]  stepping over every
[2162.86s -> 2164.86s]  single human bound.
[2164.86s -> 2166.86s]  You know what I mean? I'm boundless in my brain.
[2166.86s -> 2178.32s]  Alright, saved.
[2178.32s -> 2180.32s]  Alright.
[2180.32s -> 2182.92s]  I'm going to skip this.
[2182.92s -> 2185.68s]  Don't skip
[2185.68s -> 2187.68s]  the cutscene for this one. What?
[2187.68s -> 2189.68s]  I have to. What if it
[2189.68s -> 2191.68s]  breaks?
[2191.68s -> 2195.68s]  It's going to get stuck again.
[2199.58s -> 2203.98s]  It's going to get stuck again.
[2203.98s -> 2222.72s]  Skip it, please.
[2228.94s -> 2231.24s]  I can't. See?
[2231.24s -> 2233.24s]  I told you.
[2233.24s -> 2248.86s]  I opened the tray on purpose.
[2248.86s -> 2251.87s]  Because I wanted to be right.
[2251.87s -> 2265.31s]  What? Oh, a bird!
[2265.31s -> 2267.31s]  What? It's in the room.
[2267.31s -> 2270.51s]  Alright, that was fucking not even funny. Why did I do that?
[2270.51s -> 2278.44s]  Now I am being skipped.
[2278.44s -> 2285.36s]  It's the dry
[2285.36s -> 2287.36s]  laugh he does.
[2287.36s -> 2289.36s]  Every stream. No, I don't do that every
[2289.36s -> 2296.33s]  stream. What if I can get
[2296.33s -> 2299.34s]  through this, are we? You're stuck here.
[2299.34s -> 2301.34s]  And I'm Jammer Lammy.
[2301.34s -> 2316.19s]  Alright.
[2316.19s -> 2318.19s]  We'll watch the whole thing. I'm going to close my eyes
[2318.19s -> 2320.75s]  and block my ears.
[2320.75s -> 2327.45s]  Tell me when it's over.
[2327.45s -> 2330.14s]  No. Why do they all
[2330.14s -> 2332.14s]  do this? I tried to go
[2332.14s -> 2334.14s]  down to the menu. Oh my god.
[2336.51s -> 2339.12s]  I hit down
[2339.12s -> 2341.12s]  to go to menu.
[2341.12s -> 2343.12s]  But it was on menu already.
[2352.00s -> 2362.04s]  Load, okay.
[2362.04s -> 2366.96s]  Load game. Load.
[2366.96s -> 2369.20s]  Alright. Apparently
[2369.20s -> 2371.20s]  it's been loaded. Stage select.
[2371.20s -> 2373.20s]  Level three.
[2373.20s -> 2375.63s]  Let's go.
[2375.63s -> 2383.10s]  Enjoy.
[2386.04s -> 2388.04s]  Here, stock up on this pizza.
[2388.04s -> 2390.04s]  Stock up on this pizza.
[2396.04s -> 2398.04s]  Skip. You do
[2398.04s -> 2400.04s]  realize.
[2400.04s -> 2402.04s]  Guys, if I don't skip it,
[2402.04s -> 2404.04s]  half of everybody in here is going to
[2404.04s -> 2406.04s]  be very upset with me. If I
[2406.04s -> 2408.04s]  do skip it, half
[2408.04s -> 2410.04s]  of everybody is going to be very upset
[2410.04s -> 2415.42s]  with me. It's a double
[2415.42s -> 2417.42s]  it's just two edges to
[2417.42s -> 2419.85s]  the sword. No matter what happens,
[2419.85s -> 2421.85s]  I'm always going to get like cut by the
[2421.85s -> 2427.80s]  blade.
[2444.06s -> 2446.06s]  The sword of plus two and minus
[2446.06s -> 2448.06s]  two.
[2448.06s -> 2450.06s]  Skip the whole game. Why would I do that?
[2450.06s -> 2452.06s]  I purchased it specifically.
[2454.56s -> 2456.56s]  I hate this part.
[2463.88s -> 2465.88s]  I hate this part.
[2469.88s -> 2471.88s]  Alright, it's not skipping.
[2475.88s -> 2478.06s]  Okay, it's not
[2478.06s -> 2480.30s]  skipping.
[2495.69s -> 2497.69s]  Why? You didn't really have a baby, did you?
[2499.69s -> 2501.69s]  No!
[2501.69s -> 2503.69s]  No!
[2503.69s -> 2507.53s]  No!
[2507.53s -> 2520.27s]  Skip it quick!
[2520.27s -> 2522.27s]  Why?
[2522.27s -> 2524.89s]  Alright, I'm going to, I'm washing the disc.
[2524.89s -> 2527.84s]  There's nothing, there's no scratches
[2527.84s -> 2529.84s]  on this disc. How do you
[2529.84s -> 2534.12s]  how do I wash something?
[2534.12s -> 2538.48s]  How do you wash this? Toothpaste.
[2538.48s -> 2540.72s]  Alright, we're going to toothpaste it.
[2540.72s -> 2544.36s]  Right? Is that how you do it?
[2544.36s -> 2546.36s]  I'm going to put like a shirt on.
[2546.36s -> 2548.36s]  No, don't. That's not how you do it.
[2548.36s -> 2551.37s]  Wipe it with a cloth.
[2551.37s -> 2556.62s]  Alright, hold on. I'll be right back.
[2556.62s -> 2561.29s]  What the fuck? Oh my
[2561.29s -> 2563.29s]  god. Is the stream still on?
[2563.29s -> 2572.00s]  What the fuck is going on?
[2572.00s -> 2574.00s]  Stop! Why do I
[2574.00s -> 2576.68s]  have this other controller here?
[2576.68s -> 2578.68s]  I have this other Playstation 2 controller that's
[2578.68s -> 2580.68s]  on my lap. It's been on my lap the whole time.
[2580.68s -> 2583.76s]  Okay, we're good.
[2583.76s -> 2732.62s]  Alright, if this don't work, I don't
[2732.62s -> 2736.46s]  know what will.
[2736.46s -> 2738.83s]  I did peanut butter. You know, if you get gum
[2738.83s -> 2740.83s]  on your hair, you do peanut butter.
[2740.83s -> 2742.83s]  So, let's see if
[2742.83s -> 2756.01s]  it works. Well, I
[2756.01s -> 2758.01s]  had to do that because I don't have toothpaste.
[2758.01s -> 2760.01s]  I don't brush my teeth with toothpaste.
[2760.01s -> 2762.89s]  I don't even have a toothbrush.
[2762.89s -> 2769.48s]  So, I have a teething stick.
[2769.48s -> 2771.85s]  You know, like your dog chews
[2771.85s -> 2773.85s]  on like bone, I just chew on like a
[2773.85s -> 2776.22s]  teething bone. And then I hold
[2776.22s -> 2778.22s]  my mouth open in the shower just like this so that
[2778.22s -> 2780.22s]  my teeth out and just have it just fray my fucking face
[2780.22s -> 2785.15s]  really hard.
[2785.15s -> 2787.15s]  I just like, I chew on a bone.
[2802.35s -> 2804.35s]  Alright, here we go.
[2804.35s -> 2806.52s]  Which one is it on?
[2806.52s -> 2808.52s]  Why have I done this?
[2808.52s -> 2810.52s]  Does red mean highlighted?
[2810.52s -> 2812.52s]  Or does it green mean
[2812.52s -> 2814.52s]  highlighted? I've already fucked it up. Green is
[2814.52s -> 2816.89s]  highlighted, right?
[2816.89s -> 2818.89s]  Red is highlighted.
[2818.89s -> 2825.79s]  Okay. I'm skipping
[2825.79s -> 2827.79s]  that cutscene. We're not gonna give it a second.
[2827.79s -> 2835.13s]  Here we go. Don't even give it a
[2835.13s -> 2838.91s]  second. What do you mean don't
[2838.91s -> 2841.47s]  skip? I'm skipping it.
[2841.47s -> 2848.25s]  Done.
[2848.25s -> 2852.65s]  Goddamn broken ass
[2852.65s -> 2854.65s]  disk.
[2854.65s -> 2858.24s]  I'm getting the PlayStation 1. Stay right there.
[2858.24s -> 2868.48s]  What does this have for power?
[2868.48s -> 2870.97s]  Oh, I don't even know what that is.
[2870.97s -> 2872.97s]  I have no idea what the power is for this thing.
[2872.97s -> 2879.80s]  I have no idea.
[2879.80s -> 2882.30s]  It's a plug with a
[2882.30s -> 2884.73s]  yellow plug.
[2884.73s -> 2886.73s]  I don't even know what that looks like.
[2886.73s -> 2892.17s]  I want to continue playing it. I want
[2892.17s -> 2894.17s]  to play this. Where is it?
[2894.17s -> 2896.86s]  Come on. It's somewhere in here.
[2896.86s -> 2898.86s]  I just cleaned up two.
[2898.86s -> 2904.22s]  Oh.
[2904.22s -> 2906.22s]  I just cleaned it all up too and it's not. I don't know where it is.
[2908.96s -> 2911.77s]  Wait a minute. Is it this one?
[2911.77s -> 2914.01s]  What is this? No.
[2914.01s -> 2916.83s]  That's the Nintendo Switch.
[2916.83s -> 2932.44s]  What the fuck was that? Was it the PS2?
[2932.44s -> 2936.73s]  Do it on an emulator?
[2936.73s -> 2938.73s]  I mean, I gotta go
[2938.73s -> 2941.74s]  get an emulator.
[2941.74s -> 2943.74s]  I have to go get it and set up a
[2943.74s -> 2945.74s]  PlayStation 1 emulator?
[2945.74s -> 2948.94s]  Found it.
[2948.94s -> 2950.94s]  Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it.
[2950.94s -> 2952.94s]  I got it. Hold on.
[2952.94s -> 2957.42s]  Alright. Give me a minute.
[2957.42s -> 2959.66s]  This is going to be kind of
[2959.66s -> 2961.66s]  fucked up but let's go for it. Let's see if I can do this.
[2961.66s -> 2964.80s]  Hold on. Stay right there.
[2964.80s -> 2966.80s]  I'll be right back.
[2966.80s -> 3028.56s]  That was pretty damn quick.
[3028.56s -> 3030.56s]  That was pretty damn
[3030.56s -> 3033.50s]  quick. Let's see if it
[3033.50s -> 3039.58s]  worked. Can you see? That was pretty
[3039.58s -> 3051.02s]  damn quick. Here we go.
[3051.02s -> 3061.50s]  Let's go. Ah, blue.
[3061.50s -> 3063.50s]  Don't skip. What are you?
[3063.50s -> 3069.07s]  Guys, I just hooked up an entire
[3069.07s -> 3071.07s]  new console in like
[3071.07s -> 3073.07s]  41 seconds.
[3073.07s -> 3075.37s]  That has to be some kind of record.
[3075.37s -> 3082.60s]  Has to be. Don't skip.
[3082.60s -> 3091.87s]  Alright. Here we go.
[3091.87s -> 3105.05s]  Shit. Wait.
[3105.05s -> 3109.02s]  It's already loaded. Right. Okay. Here we go.
[3109.02s -> 3111.02s]  Sharper too. This guy's playing on
[3111.02s -> 3113.02s]  original hardware.
[3115.58s -> 3118.44s]  I'm skipping it.
[3118.44s -> 3120.44s]  Let's go.
[3120.44s -> 3129.40s]  Let's go.
[3129.40s -> 3131.40s]  I'm killing it right now.
[3131.40s -> 3153.68s]  Let's go.
[3153.68s -> 3163.98s]  I'm killing it right now.
[3163.98s -> 3169.93s]  I'm killing it right now.
[3169.93s -> 3173.90s]  I'm killing it right now.
[3173.90s -> 3176.20s]  I got confused.
[3176.20s -> 3208.97s]  I got confused.
[3208.97s -> 3214.16s]  I got confused.
[3214.16s -> 3216.16s]  Diaper check. What's in there?
[3216.16s -> 3243.40s]  Fuck.
[3243.40s -> 3257.23s]  The pit rate's going down.
[3257.23s -> 3260.94s]  The pit rate's going down.
[3260.94s -> 3262.94s]  What the fuck?
[3264.94s -> 3266.94s]  And she fucking pukes. I hate this thing.
[3280.33s -> 3285.12s]  I swear.
[3285.12s -> 3303.66s]  I want to do that one again.
[3317.64s -> 3319.64s]  Thank you. You got a little...
[3324.20s -> 3326.20s]  I only have eight more minutes.
[3326.20s -> 3328.70s]  Hates his viewers.
[3328.70s -> 3330.70s]  What are you talking about?
[3330.70s -> 3345.04s]  Let's see now.
[3345.04s -> 3347.04s]  Was it the green button
[3347.04s -> 3349.04s]  or the blue switch?
[3351.98s -> 3355.37s]  In there.
[3355.37s -> 3357.37s]  Have somebody seen?
[3357.37s -> 3359.37s]  Where in the world were you, soldier?
[3359.37s -> 3361.37s]  Haven't you ever heard the term
[3361.37s -> 3363.37s]  punctual? In the Air Force,
[3363.37s -> 3365.37s]  a split second decision makes the difference
[3365.37s -> 3367.37s]  between life and death.
[3367.37s -> 3369.37s]  Don't you know?
[3369.37s -> 3372.00s]  Here we go.
[3372.00s -> 3374.00s]  Oh, I kind of forgot
[3374.00s -> 3376.00s]  how to fly.
[3376.00s -> 3378.00s]  Is it the best song?
[3378.00s -> 3380.00s]  See, I had to go
[3380.00s -> 3382.00s]  repair my denture a few days ago.
[3384.00s -> 3387.13s]  Boy,
[3387.13s -> 3392.11s]  I can eat almonds.
[3392.11s -> 3394.28s]  Look,
[3394.28s -> 3396.28s]  I told you we don't have all day.
[3396.28s -> 3398.28s]  Get to work now, soldier.
[3398.28s -> 3405.00s]  This guy,
[3405.00s -> 3407.00s]  another one of those.
[3421.69s -> 3423.69s]  Casino?
[3442.65s -> 3448.35s]  It's a casino
[3448.35s -> 3450.35s]  airplane.
[3454.59s -> 3470.59s]  Come on, you can do it, PS1.
[3470.59s -> 3474.56s]  It's supposed to be
[3474.56s -> 3476.56s]  in there, come on.
[3476.56s -> 3488.83s]  Put it back in the PS2.
[3488.83s -> 3490.83s]  Oh,
[3490.83s -> 3492.83s]  fucking goddammit.
[3494.83s -> 3497.64s]  Did I save it before this one?
[3497.64s -> 3519.45s]  Come on!
[3519.45s -> 3528.16s]  PS1 for cutscenes
[3528.16s -> 3530.16s]  and PS2 for when you load it in.
[3536.04s -> 3556.83s]  Give me one second.
[3556.83s -> 3560.48s]  Let's plug the power in.
[3560.48s -> 3562.48s]  Which one is the right cord?
[3562.48s -> 3564.48s]  I don't remember, it's this one.
[3564.48s -> 3569.02s]  Alright, back to the PS2.
[3569.02s -> 3578.28s]  Okay, let's go.
[3578.28s -> 3591.92s]  I'm going to plug that in.
[3591.92s -> 3596.33s]  I need the memory card, the controller,
[3596.33s -> 3617.88s]  and let's go.
[3617.88s -> 3619.88s]  I had a save point right there,
[3619.88s -> 3622.44s]  so I'm just going to skip that cutscene
[3622.44s -> 3627.37s]  and see what happens.
[3627.37s -> 3630.25s]  Let's emulate it.
[3630.25s -> 3632.25s]  It would take like 30 minutes for me to set up an emulator.
[3632.25s -> 3634.49s]  It takes me 25 seconds
[3634.49s -> 3636.49s]  to switch consoles.
[3636.49s -> 3652.94s]  Let's see, here we go.
[3652.94s -> 3656.14s]  Stage left, stage four.
[3656.14s -> 3658.38s]  Skip.
[3673.15s -> 3681.21s]  Wait, we're rocking?
[3681.21s -> 3684.91s]  Alright, cool.
[3696.17s -> 3698.17s]  Let's go!
[3748.34s -> 3750.34s]  I fucked that up.
[3753.34s -> 3755.34s]  Uh-oh!
[3755.34s -> 3758.28s]  Uh-oh!
[3781.68s -> 3783.68s]  Get out of here!
[3819.64s -> 3831.29s]  And then I run out of oxygen.
[3831.29s -> 3847.10s]  I kind of...
[3847.10s -> 3849.10s]  I kind of killed that one.
[3853.10s -> 3870.86s]  Save it.
[3870.86s -> 3872.86s]  That sounded absolutely awful.
[3872.86s -> 3892.70s]  Well, some adventure, hey?
[3901.26s -> 3903.26s]  Thanks.
[3903.26s -> 3905.26s]  I only have two minutes!
[3905.26s -> 3907.26s]  I only have three more minutes.
[3907.26s -> 3909.26s]  But close enough now.
[3909.26s -> 3911.56s]  Thanks, sir.
[3913.56s -> 3915.56s]  I think we got over all the problems.
[3915.56s -> 3922.99s]  Guitar! My guitar!
[3922.99s -> 3924.99s]  Where did I put it?
[3924.99s -> 3926.99s]  All the problems are gone, I think.
[3926.99s -> 3928.99s]  It was the middle of the game.
[3928.99s -> 3931.55s]  Oh, no!
[3931.55s -> 3933.92s]  I left it on the plane!
[3933.92s -> 3935.92s]  Hey, there's one.
[3935.92s -> 3943.98s]  A guitar.
[3943.98s -> 3951.47s]  What kind?
[3951.47s -> 3953.71s]  Well, um, a cool one.
[3953.71s -> 3955.71s]  An awesome sound and has reclining seats,
[3955.71s -> 3957.71s]  power steering and door airbags.
[3957.71s -> 3959.71s]  I don't have time for jokers!
[3959.71s -> 3961.71s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3961.71s -> 3963.71s]  I'm sorry.
[3963.71s -> 3965.71s]  I just want one that's cool and cheap,
[3965.71s -> 3967.71s]  and of course the sound quality's gotta be superior.
[3967.71s -> 3969.71s]  Hmm, a greedy girl, ain't ya?
[3969.71s -> 3971.71s]  Oh, please!
[3971.71s -> 3973.71s]  I'll do anything, anything, please!
[3973.71s -> 3981.45s]  What?
[3981.45s -> 3983.45s]  Help! Go away!
[3983.45s -> 3986.91s]  You said anything, didn't ya?
[3986.91s -> 3988.91s]  You're going to kill me with a chainsaw.
[3988.91s -> 3990.91s]  You're going to kill me with a chainsaw.
[3990.91s -> 3992.91s]  Come on!
[3992.91s -> 3994.91s]  Let's make a guitar!
[3994.91s -> 3996.91s]  But, but I don't make a guitar.
[3999.53s -> 4002.22s]  Casino here, casino there.
[4002.22s -> 4004.22s]  Casino in my hair.
[4008.22s -> 4012.12s]  Don't touch the top of that thing.
[4012.12s -> 4014.12s]  Get your hands away from the top of that.
[4014.12s -> 4016.12s]  It's not going to be good.
[4016.12s -> 4053.87s]  Go.
[4053.87s -> 4055.87s]  Oh, shit!
[4055.87s -> 4081.40s]  What happened?
[4081.40s -> 4107.56s]  Come on, bring it back.
[4130.70s -> 4132.70s]  I just tied the things in perfectly.
[4132.70s -> 4158.75s]  Almost done.
[4172.75s -> 4176.32s]  Ah, fuck!
[4176.32s -> 4178.32s]  Back to the PS1.
[4178.32s -> 4180.32s]  What?
[4180.32s -> 4182.32s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's drying.
[4182.32s -> 4212.65s]  We're almost done with the song.
[4212.65s -> 4219.50s]  We're almost done with the song.
[4219.50s -> 4221.50s]  It's like this last line here.
[4221.50s -> 4229.50s]  Look it, it's done.
[4229.50s -> 4232.49s]  Come on, do it!
[4232.49s -> 4234.86s]  It's right there.
[4234.86s -> 4243.18s]  Just grab the guitar and be done.
[4243.18s -> 4252.01s]  It's right there.
[4252.01s -> 4254.01s]  It's right here.
[4254.01s -> 4277.42s]  Open track, close it quick.
[4277.42s -> 4331.29s]  I'm only doing this one more fucking goddamn time.
[4331.29s -> 4334.36s]  I ain't doing this again.
[4334.36s -> 4336.36s]  This is the last time I'm doing this.
[4355.32s -> 4361.85s]  All the problems are gone.
[4361.85s -> 4363.85s]  They were though, they actually were.
[4363.85s -> 4370.76s]  Put in a backwards compatible PS3.
[4370.76s -> 4372.76s]  That's not going to do it.
[4372.76s -> 4388.86s]  Here we go.
[4388.86s -> 4390.86s]  Skip the cutscene fucking immediately.
[4390.86s -> 4392.86s]  You already saw it.
[4400.28s -> 4410.44s]  Go.
[4410.44s -> 4412.44s]  Please, PlayStation 1, do it.
[4464.09s -> 4466.78s]  What is it talking about?
[4466.78s -> 4473.44s]  I did it.
[4473.44s -> 4475.44s]  I'm not spamming.
[4502.00s -> 4513.63s]  It's almost like it takes too long
[4513.63s -> 4515.63s]  to get to the next note and you stop playing.
[4515.63s -> 4553.13s]  I really need to move on.
[4567.55s -> 4571.20s]  All right, we're good.
[4571.20s -> 4573.20s]  How many more levels are there in this game?
[4577.20s -> 4580.08s]  No, I don't think it's going to happen again.
[4580.08s -> 4582.08s]  This is like the last level.
[4582.08s -> 4602.99s]  There's no way it's going to happen again.
[4602.99s -> 4607.08s]  This is the last level.
[4607.08s -> 4609.08s]  This is the last level.
[4609.08s -> 4613.76s]  This is the last level.
[4613.76s -> 4615.76s]  There's no way it's going to happen again.
[4615.76s -> 4624.08s]  For one second, I thought it was happening again.
[4624.08s -> 4626.08s]  I thought that was actually happening again.
[4626.08s -> 4628.08s]  All right.
[4628.08s -> 4642.54s]  Straight to hell.
[4671.92s -> 4673.92s]  All right, so I went back in time.
[4673.92s -> 4680.96s]  Who thinks you are coming in this late?
[4680.96s -> 4683.58s]  Who thinks you are coming in this late?
[4683.58s -> 4685.58s]  Don't underestimate me just because I'm an idol.
[4685.58s -> 4687.58s]  Don't underestimate me just because I'm an idol.
[4687.58s -> 4689.58s]  Come on, it's time to do it.
[4689.58s -> 4692.01s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4692.01s -> 4694.01s]  You see, I was on my way to my own show,
[4694.01s -> 4696.01s]  but I ended up here.
[4696.01s -> 4698.01s]  How did that happen?
[4698.01s -> 4700.01s]  Anyways, I'll help you get to where you're going.
[4700.01s -> 4702.01s]  Where's hell?
[4702.01s -> 4704.01s]  Can you really do that?
[4704.01s -> 4706.01s]  Yeah, only if you play right.
[4706.01s -> 4708.01s]  Come on.
[4708.01s -> 4711.08s]  This is the original PlayStation 1 version.
[4711.08s -> 4713.08s]  This is the original PlayStation 1 version?
[4713.08s -> 4716.92s]  And A version.
[4716.92s -> 4719.48s]  Really?
[4719.48s -> 4721.48s]  Why would they censor hell?
[4721.48s -> 4731.77s]  Please, just do it.
[4731.77s -> 4733.77s]  Just do it.
[4733.77s -> 4737.23s]  Yes, all right, we're good.
[4737.23s -> 4739.40s]  Let's get cool on this one.
[4739.40s -> 4741.40s]  That does not look very safe.
[4753.18s -> 4755.18s]  It looked right.
[4755.18s -> 4778.09s]  There's an electrocuting vehicle in the crowd.
[4778.09s -> 4780.27s]  There's an electrocuting vehicle in the crowd.
[4780.27s -> 4785.84s]  Electrocuting!
[4799.08s -> 4810.28s]  I can't move it.
[4812.52s -> 4814.52s]  I can still go?
[4839.69s -> 4841.69s]  Even this one.
[4841.69s -> 4845.21s]  Oh no.
[4845.21s -> 4847.96s]  Okay, let's go.
[4847.96s -> 4849.96s]  Here we go.
[4849.96s -> 4851.96s]  No fucking around now.
[4851.96s -> 4862.27s]  Check this out.
[4886.65s -> 4888.65s]  You guys don't understand.
[4917.63s -> 4920.19s]  Fuck.
[4920.19s -> 4922.19s]  You don't understand the song.
[4922.19s -> 4924.19s]  It's fucking weird.
[4924.19s -> 4930.20s]  The beat is off.
[4930.20s -> 4937.24s]  What the fuck?
[4937.24s -> 4939.24s]  I'm playing to a different song.
[4939.24s -> 4955.24s]  What did I do wrong there?
[4961.24s -> 4963.24s]  Huh?
[4963.24s -> 4972.06s]  What?
[4972.06s -> 4974.06s]  I'm pressing the button
[4974.06s -> 4976.06s]  when it goes over every time.
[4976.06s -> 4992.04s]  What the fuck?
[4992.04s -> 4995.76s]  This one.
[4995.76s -> 4997.76s]  It's not the controller.
[4997.76s -> 5005.88s]  It's this shitty song.
[5005.88s -> 5019.24s]  That was so...
[5019.24s -> 5021.24s]  That was so fucking bad.
[5021.24s -> 5023.24s]  Explain to me.
[5023.24s -> 5025.24s]  That was the worst line I've ever done.
[5025.24s -> 5027.24s]  And I still won.
[5027.24s -> 5031.34s]  I still got it.
[5031.34s -> 5033.58s]  No.
[5033.58s -> 5035.58s]  I just wanted to pause the game.
[5035.58s -> 5037.58s]  Why can't you pause video games back in the year 2000?
[5037.58s -> 5039.76s]  Why can't you not pause video games back in 1999?
[5039.76s -> 5052.88s]  It's cheating.
[5052.88s -> 5054.88s]  What if I have to go to the bathroom?
[5054.88s -> 5056.88s]  What if I'm about to beat the level and I'm going to shit my pants?
[5056.88s -> 5063.98s]  You have to hold it.
[5086.49s -> 5088.49s]  What is this song?
[5095.36s -> 5097.36s]  I hate this song.
[5104.08s -> 5126.03s]  Guys.
[5126.03s -> 5128.27s]  This song is dead.
[5132.68s -> 5134.68s]  Guys, seriously.
[5134.68s -> 5136.68s]  You don't understand.
[5140.68s -> 5145.68s]  Come on.
[5145.68s -> 5147.68s]  Bring it back. I don't want to do this again.
[5147.68s -> 5153.44s]  Come on.
[5153.44s -> 5155.93s]  Back up. Please.
[5155.93s -> 5178.59s]  So bad.
[5178.59s -> 5201.44s]  Why was it worth points?
[5201.44s -> 5203.44s]  Yes. Yes. I did it.
[5210.70s -> 5214.92s]  Unbanned.
[5214.92s -> 5216.92s]  I did it.
[5219.47s -> 5225.04s]  That was...
[5225.04s -> 5227.04s]  That song...
[5227.04s -> 5229.04s]  That was not a very good song for me.
[5229.04s -> 5231.92s]  I like that one.
[5235.92s -> 5237.92s]  That's all I heard.
[5237.92s -> 5239.92s]  I couldn't hear the words.
[5250.78s -> 5252.78s]  They put this crazy filter on some of these voices.
[5252.78s -> 5254.78s]  I can't even hear the words.
[5263.05s -> 5265.05s]  You took my job.
[5265.05s -> 5267.05s]  My watch is broken. My guitar strings broke.
[5267.05s -> 5269.05s]  My costume has wrinkles.
[5269.05s -> 5271.05s]  And I don't get any messages on my beeper.
[5271.05s -> 5273.74s]  Because of you.
[5273.74s -> 5275.74s]  Say what?
[5275.74s -> 5277.74s]  Let's see who's the better guitarist.
[5277.74s -> 5279.74s]  I'm really in a hurry.
[5279.74s -> 5283.12s]  Some other day.
[5283.12s -> 5285.12s]  Follow me in.
[5285.12s -> 5292.35s]  Get back here.
[5292.35s -> 5294.35s]  Hey, check this out.
[5294.35s -> 5296.35s]  Live in concert.
[5296.35s -> 5298.35s]  Milk can. That's us.
[5298.35s -> 5301.68s]  That's right around the corner.
[5301.68s -> 5303.68s]  Uh-huh.
[5303.68s -> 5305.68s]  That's why we have to get going right now.
[5305.68s -> 5308.81s]  How does this look?
[5308.81s -> 5310.81s]  This has been a wild ride.
[5310.81s -> 5312.81s]  Well, what about this one?
[5312.81s -> 5314.81s]  But this kind of makes me look heavy.
[5314.81s -> 5316.81s]  You think this one's better?
[5322.20s -> 5327.13s]  That's it.
[5327.13s -> 5329.13s]  The band's logo's gotta be really big.
[5329.13s -> 5331.13s]  My picture doesn't have to stand out.
[5331.13s -> 5333.13s]  My picture doesn't have to stand out.
[5333.13s -> 5335.13s]  Oh, come on.
[5335.13s -> 5345.95s]  It reminds me of one of those
[5345.95s -> 5347.95s]  weird, like, fucked up YouTube kids videos.
[5347.95s -> 5349.95s]  I'm really, really sorry. I got caught up in a lot of this.
[5352.19s -> 5354.19s]  Okay, this is it.
[5354.19s -> 5356.19s]  Are you okay?
[5356.19s -> 5358.19s]  Oh, yeah. Milk can is always on my mind.
[5362.28s -> 5371.12s]  Lead it to Milk Can!
[5371.12s -> 5373.12s]  Was Parappa like this too?
[5373.12s -> 5375.12s]  I think it was.
[5375.12s -> 5382.22s]  Parappa being this dialed up to like
[5382.22s -> 5384.22s]  1,000.
[5384.22s -> 5387.93s]  Here we go.
[5387.93s -> 5391.96s]  Oh, here's the title song.
[5403.79s -> 5412.49s]  Get up, get up.
[5412.49s -> 5430.03s]  That was awesome.
[5430.03s -> 5432.03s]  That was awesome.
[5450.65s -> 5452.65s]  I missed that one.
[5452.65s -> 5480.49s]  Something's confusing.
[5480.49s -> 5482.49s]  What the fuck is my turn?
[5504.76s -> 5507.00s]  No.
[5507.00s -> 5509.00s]  That was fucking cheating.
[5519.69s -> 5522.00s]  Last song.
[5522.00s -> 5524.00s]  Wait, if I hold my hand on the PlayStation.
[5524.00s -> 5526.00s]  Okay, I have to have one hand on the PlayStation.
[5528.49s -> 5541.23s]  Put your foot up there. Okay.
[5541.23s -> 5550.36s]  That's a good idea.
[5550.36s -> 5576.40s]  Come on!
[5576.40s -> 5578.40s]  God damn it. I can hear it running.
[5616.36s -> 5618.36s]  Squared and doing it?
[5618.36s -> 5626.81s]  No, it's fucked.
[5626.81s -> 5630.84s]  This thing is fucked.
[5630.84s -> 5635.32s]  This is fucked up.
[5635.32s -> 5638.89s]  Was this the last song?
[5638.89s -> 5640.89s]  Do Megalovania? Hold on.
[5655.10s -> 5680.70s]  This is the last song, right?
[5680.70s -> 5682.94s]  We just pretended that I did it.
[5682.94s -> 5684.94s]  Wait, movement.
[5684.94s -> 5687.12s]  What if I just don't touch anything?
[5687.12s -> 5703.63s]  We want the falls.
[5706.24s -> 5708.86s]  Come on.
[5708.86s -> 5714.22s]  Just be patient with it.
[5714.22s -> 5718.76s]  Turn the PlayStation one upside down.
[5718.76s -> 5727.02s]  What the fuck?
[5727.02s -> 5732.00s]  It's upside down.
[5732.00s -> 5741.98s]  It's not fair.
[5741.98s -> 5748.49s]  It's not fair.
[5748.49s -> 5751.37s]  Come on, stop.
[5751.37s -> 5754.96s]  It worked for a second.
[5769.80s -> 5782.28s]  Ow!
[5782.28s -> 5784.28s]  The sucker baited me.
[5802.81s -> 5807.87s]  Oh, fuck.
[5807.87s -> 5812.84s]  This is not good.
[5812.84s -> 5814.84s]  Turn it back right side up.
[5814.84s -> 5820.09s]  What if I just move it?
[5820.09s -> 5822.72s]  I think I have to shake the PlayStation.
[5822.72s -> 5824.72s]  Just sway it back and forth.
[5841.53s -> 5844.41s]  Okay, I'm almost there.
[5844.41s -> 5846.41s]  This is going to get good.
[5861.40s -> 5868.44s]  Oh, my God.
[5868.44s -> 5870.44s]  Come on.
[5870.44s -> 5874.86s]  I don't want to...
[5874.86s -> 5877.80s]  No.
[5877.80s -> 5897.18s]  Do I get extra points?
[5897.18s -> 5899.18s]  Upside down again.
[5899.18s -> 5915.79s]  It's dead.
[5915.79s -> 5918.35s]  Wait, okay. I have a plan.
[5918.35s -> 5920.65s]  I have a plan.
[5920.65s -> 5922.65s]  I have to get cool.
[5922.65s -> 5927.64s]  I have to get cool.
[5927.64s -> 5931.36s]  I have a plan.
[5931.36s -> 5933.36s]  It should work.
[5933.36s -> 5938.41s]  I think the controls are backwards.
[5940.41s -> 5943.23s]  I know I can do this.
[5973.50s -> 5980.35s]  Doh!
[6028.48s -> 6030.48s]  I knew I was going to be able to do it.
[6030.48s -> 6032.48s]  I have to start over.
[6032.48s -> 6045.85s]  I have to get cool or it's not happening.
[6048.48s -> 6051.72s]  What?
[6051.72s -> 6063.50s]  It worked last time. Okay, I'll get it.
[6063.50s -> 6067.42s]  I'm getting teased, my love is real neat
[6067.42s -> 6071.42s]  I'm trying to shift into gear
[6071.42s -> 6075.42s]  That's when I see you coming
[6075.42s -> 6086.19s]  Trying to sack myself
[6086.19s -> 6103.21s]  Cause it seems like it's time to try to get downtown
[6103.21s -> 6109.88s]  I'm thinking I can get out now
[6109.88s -> 6111.88s]  Getting close, I'm just running, running around
[6162.63s -> 6164.63s]  To all the problems that I get through
[6164.63s -> 6173.32s]  When the times say no
[6173.32s -> 6194.08s]  I'm getting teased, my love is real neat
[6194.08s -> 6199.39s]  I'm trying to shift into gear
[6206.63s -> 6213.69s]  I'm getting teased, my love is real neat
[6213.69s -> 6215.69s]  Trying to sack myself
[6215.81s -> 6218.81s]  I'm getting teased, my love is real neat
[6218.81s -> 6223.59s]  Trying to shift into gear
[6223.59s -> 6227.15s]  That's when I see you coming
[6227.15s -> 6230.15s]  Trying to get into gear
[6230.15s -> 6239.66s]  That's when I see you coming
[6239.66s -> 6251.84s]  Trying to sack myself
[6251.84s -> 6267.03s]  Cause it seems like it's time to try to get downtown
[6267.03s -> 6284.32s]  Trying to get down town
[6284.32s -> 6346.61s]  Come on! Getting cool is just like, you gotta just spam R.I.P. shit.
[6346.61s -> 6352.91s]  Burger Boy played Parack of the Rapper 1 and spammed every single group and got cool.
[6352.91s -> 6356.62s]  Honestly, I don't stand a chance.
[6388.64s -> 6395.16s]  Get cool!
[6402.84s -> 6422.99s]  Why?!
[6422.99s -> 6454.78s]  It's about to break!
[6454.78s -> 6470.40s]  It's about to break!
[6470.40s -> 6472.96s]  I have to restart.
[6472.96s -> 6477.63s]  If I don't get cool on this one, I'm breaking the disk.
[6477.63s -> 6480.93s]  Half of my life I'm going to save it because it's worth a month.
[6494.29s -> 6496.29s]  Come on!
[6548.77s -> 6550.77s]  That was it! That was it!
[6550.77s -> 6554.80s]  That was actually it.
[6554.80s -> 6556.80s]  I had to just do a huge thing there.
[6557.80s -> 6559.80s]  Here we go. I'll get it this time. This is the one.
[6565.77s -> 6569.51s]  Okay.
[6569.51s -> 6572.32s]  Sometimes you have to get super points.
[6572.32s -> 6578.92s]  With PlayStation 2, it's too late.
[6583.27s -> 6585.27s]  Yeah!
[6600.32s -> 6664.18s]  Yeah!
[6664.18s -> 6666.18s]  Oh, fuck! No!
[6666.18s -> 6674.69s]  Did I miss the part?
[6674.69s -> 6676.69s]  No! What are we doing back here?
[6676.69s -> 6679.00s]  What are we doing back here?
[6679.00s -> 6683.41s]  Just gotta get it again.
[6718.16s -> 6720.16s]  Fighting against like a...
[6720.16s -> 6722.16s]  I'm going against the tide here, as they say.
[6722.16s -> 6728.87s]  Damn it.
[6728.87s -> 6730.87s]  I even got cool too and then I wasn't cool enough to stay cool.
[6730.87s -> 6734.52s]  Shit. I'm not breaking this disk.
[6734.52s -> 6736.52s]  It's a great game.
[6736.52s -> 6740.21s]  It was just sold to me
[6740.21s -> 6742.90s]  by some motherfucker
[6742.90s -> 6744.90s]  that didn't tell me that it was broken.
[6744.90s -> 6753.86s]  I'll be like $50, please.
[6753.86s -> 6761.16s]  Dickhead!
[6761.16s -> 6769.67s]  I don't even know how much this was.
[6769.67s -> 6776.45s]  Somebody look it up.
[6776.45s -> 6778.45s]  What's this going for right now?
[6778.45s -> 6784.15s]  I had it too. Shit!
[6784.15s -> 6786.15s]  Oh, I'm so disappointed.
[6786.15s -> 6788.71s]  It's okay. It's alright.
[6788.71s -> 6790.71s]  It's alright. Don't worry.
[6790.71s -> 6793.08s]  There's no reason to fret over that.
[6793.08s -> 6799.08s]  Shit!
[6799.08s -> 6801.08s]  I would have had it the first time if it just didn't break.
[6801.08s -> 6810.40s]  Okay.
[6810.40s -> 6814.50s]  This stream's gonna turn off here
[6814.50s -> 6816.50s]  in like 45 minutes.
[6816.50s -> 6830.07s]  I'm doing this is it.
[6830.07s -> 6832.07s]  If it doesn't solve it here, just pretend I beat the game.
[6845.96s -> 6851.97s]  That's how long you're gonna play Dead Rising 1
[6851.97s -> 6853.97s]  given how bad it is.
[6853.97s -> 6855.97s]  Dead Rising 1's a great game. What are you talking about?
[6855.97s -> 6865.62s]  Alright, let's see if we can do this.
[6865.62s -> 6867.62s]  Waste of time, yeah.
[6867.62s -> 6877.73s]  That's the kind of nature of this whole level, isn't it?
[6877.73s -> 6879.73s]  So far.
[6879.73s -> 6881.73s]  It's alright.
[6881.73s -> 6883.73s]  I'm having a good time.
[6883.73s -> 6885.73s]  This is the last level. No, it's not.
[6885.73s -> 6887.73s]  Oh, fuck.
[6887.73s -> 6895.28s]  The stream thumbnail is a blue screen.
[6897.28s -> 6909.96s]  Alright, let's see if for the last time
[6909.96s -> 6911.96s]  we hear this.
[6926.00s -> 6928.00s]  Don't fuck it up, let's go!
[6928.00s -> 6936.00s]  I wanna see some Hawke Champ!
[6936.00s -> 6938.00s]  It sucks.
[6938.00s -> 6988.48s]  I passed it.
[6988.48s -> 6990.79s]  Alright, don't fuck it up. I passed it.
[6990.79s -> 6992.79s]  I passed the glitching.
[6992.79s -> 7020.50s]  No!
[7043.22s -> 7045.22s]  So, it flipped it on me.
[7045.22s -> 7089.19s]  And I instantly lost, apparently.
[7089.19s -> 7091.19s]  So, it flipped it on me.
[7091.19s -> 7095.14s]  So, it flipped it on me.
[7095.14s -> 7099.56s]  So, it flipped it on me.
[7099.56s -> 7101.56s]  And I instantly lost, apparently.
[7101.56s -> 7103.56s]  What a fucking trick.
[7103.56s -> 7105.56s]  Why?
[7105.56s -> 7107.56s]  I even got to cool for like
[7107.56s -> 7109.56s]  about 60 seconds.
[7109.56s -> 7111.56s]  Oh my god, why?
[7111.56s -> 7113.56s]  Why?
[7117.72s -> 7119.72s]  I'm about to leave.
[7119.72s -> 7121.72s]  I gotta go home. I already am home.
[7131.06s -> 7133.06s]  What was so wrong with that?
[7149.88s -> 7151.88s]  Is this what hell feels like? No, they censored that.
[7151.88s -> 7199.09s]  LR...
[7199.09s -> 7201.91s]  What the fuck?
[7201.91s -> 7203.91s]  That's so
[7203.91s -> 7205.91s]  fucked up.
[7205.91s -> 7208.60s]  That part is such a mess.
[7208.60s -> 7210.60s]  Even if I do it right.
[7210.60s -> 7214.44s]  It doesn't make sense.
[7217.19s -> 7254.04s]  It's so slow.
[7254.04s -> 7259.80s]  You motherfucker.
[7259.80s -> 7263.00s]  Hey!
[7263.00s -> 7281.75s]  Did you see that?
[7281.75s -> 7293.46s]  He had his fucking game now.
[7293.46s -> 7295.46s]  It was trying to fuck me over
[7295.46s -> 7298.66s]  at the very end of that.
[7298.66s -> 7317.91s]  There he is.
[7317.91s -> 7324.61s]  Okay, I did it.
[7331.33s -> 7348.47s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7348.47s -> 7350.47s]  I stopped dicking around earlier.
[7350.47s -> 7352.47s]  I had to change consoles
[7352.47s -> 7354.47s]  to stop the game from crashing.
[7354.47s -> 7356.47s]  I would have beat it the first time.
[7356.47s -> 7362.74s]  What? I would have beat it the first time.
[7362.74s -> 7364.74s]  I didn't mess around and have the game
[7364.74s -> 7366.74s]  crash mid song.
[7366.74s -> 7380.63s]  I was talking.
[7380.63s -> 7383.32s]  You couldn't hear me?
[7383.32s -> 7386.77s]  What is he saying?
[7386.77s -> 7388.77s]  Somebody said if only he stopped dicking around
[7388.77s -> 7391.27s]  in the beginning.
[7391.27s -> 7393.27s]  I have been trying
[7393.27s -> 7395.27s]  to switch consoles like
[7395.27s -> 7407.30s]  five times.
[7407.30s -> 7417.80s]  You should have just had an emulator.
[7417.80s -> 7420.16s]  Illegal!
[7420.16s -> 7438.71s]  You should have overclocked
[7438.71s -> 7441.33s]  your Playstation 1.
[7441.33s -> 7444.08s]  Alright, so let's see.
[7444.08s -> 7448.82s]  Wait, what's going on?
[7448.82s -> 7473.84s]  Why is this running at like two frames a second?
[7473.84s -> 7485.36s]  He's made a 3D movie maker.
[7489.72s -> 7491.72s]  Why is that the post credits thing?
[7491.72s -> 7506.74s]  Parappa?
[7506.74s -> 7508.74s]  I have a Parappa the Rapper one.
[7538.56s -> 7540.56s]  What about you, PJ?
[7540.56s -> 7542.56s]  I have a chocolate frosty
[7542.56s -> 7544.56s]  and a cherry pie.
[7544.56s -> 7546.56s]  No, no, no. I'm talking about Katie's Lime Show.
[7546.56s -> 7548.56s]  What are you going to do?
[7548.56s -> 7550.56s]  Oh, then I'll have six chocolate frosties
[7550.56s -> 7552.56s]  and a large cherry pie.
[7563.11s -> 7577.11s]  Here we go.
[7577.11s -> 7582.93s]  Yeah!
[7604.93s -> 7606.93s]  Get the fuck out of my way!
[7610.93s -> 7612.93s]  Get the fuck out of my way!
[7626.52s -> 7628.52s]  He needs to eat some fucking vegetables.
[7705.49s -> 7707.49s]  Then I'll pour me rain.
[7709.73s -> 7711.73s]  And just push the button.
[7711.73s -> 7713.73s]  Pour me rain.
[7713.73s -> 7715.91s]  Come. Then I'll come.
[7715.91s -> 7717.91s]  Then I'll come. Pour me rain.
[7717.91s -> 7719.91s]  Pour me rain. Then come.
[7719.91s -> 7722.34s]  Pour me push.
[7722.34s -> 7724.34s]  Then I'll rain. Come.
[7732.00s -> 7734.00s]  No, no, I gotta get out of here.
[7734.00s -> 7736.00s]  I have to leave now.
[7736.00s -> 7738.00s]  I have to leave now.
[7738.00s -> 7750.98s]  No.
[7750.98s -> 7752.98s]  No. No.
[7752.98s -> 7754.98s]  Alright, that's it.
[7754.98s -> 7756.98s]  That's it. That's it.
[7756.98s -> 7760.31s]  That's the stream. I'm out of here.
[7760.31s -> 7762.31s]  My stomach hurts.
[7762.31s -> 7767.17s]  I have to leave.
[7767.17s -> 7769.17s]  No. Okay.
[7769.17s -> 7771.41s]  I will see you tomorrow.
[7771.41s -> 7777.24s]  I have to...
[7777.24s -> 7779.41s]  As the term goes.
[7779.41s -> 7783.25s]  I gotta get out of here.
[7783.25s -> 7789.78s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[7789.78s -> 7791.78s]  Unfortunately we ran into technical problems
[7791.78s -> 7795.30s]  I'm Jeremy Lammydisc.
[7795.30s -> 7799.14s]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[7799.14s -> 7801.14s]  We're gonna play Tryin' Tomorrow
[7801.14s -> 7804.07s]  with Star.
[7804.07s -> 7807.72s]  So that'll be just kind of a chill stream.
[7807.72s -> 7809.72s]  Solving puzzles and shit.
[7809.72s -> 7814.52s]  I think Ashley's gonna come too.
[7814.52s -> 7816.52s]  So that should be a good one. And then
[7816.52s -> 7818.52s]  we're gonna get away from the PlayStation
[7818.52s -> 7820.52s]  1 and PlayStation 2 stuff. We're gonna play The Thing
[7820.52s -> 7822.52s]  on probably Monday.
[7822.52s -> 7829.43s]  So I'll see you guys later.
[7829.43s -> 7831.43s]  Thanks for watching.
[7831.43s -> 7834.55s]  This was a lot of fun.
[7834.55s -> 7836.55s]  Guitar Man was awesome.
[7836.55s -> 7838.98s]  This was fun too.
[7838.98s -> 7841.80s]  Hope you enjoyed yourselves. I'll see you guys
[7841.80s -> 7844.93s]  tomorrow. Take care.
[7844.93s -> 7847.68s]  If you're sticking around to do the bits.
[7847.68s -> 7851.14s]  Hey look I gifted 100 subs again.
[7851.14s -> 7855.81s]  We'll get to them. Tomorrow's stream
[7855.81s -> 7857.81s]  by the way is gonna be starting
[7857.81s -> 7859.81s]  Actually no it'll be
[7859.81s -> 7861.81s]  normal. Nevermind.
[7861.81s -> 7863.81s]  For some reason I was like, no it will.
[7863.81s -> 7866.69s]  Somewhere around 1 or 2 o'clock Pacific.
[7866.69s -> 7874.74s]  Dodge? What did I do?
[7874.74s -> 7881.64s]  Yeah this shit doesn't work.
[7881.64s -> 7883.64s]  It kind of, it just
[7883.64s -> 7886.77s]  doesn't make any sense. It's all good though.
[7886.77s -> 7888.77s]  Eventually I will fix this.
[7888.77s -> 7907.84s]  This stomach hurts.
[7907.84s -> 7911.62s]  So.
[7911.62s -> 7914.56s]  God damn it. I don't know
[7914.56s -> 7916.56s]  what to even say.
[7916.56s -> 7924.50s]  What do you even say?
[7924.50s -> 7929.11s]  Thank you from earlier.
[7929.11s -> 7939.28s]  We had, what's wrong with chat?
[7939.28s -> 7942.08s]  Nothing. Don't worry.
[7942.08s -> 7944.08s]  Don't look into it. Trust. Don't worry.
[7944.08s -> 7946.26s]  Freddie Dread had
[7946.26s -> 7948.26s]  10,000 bits earlier. Thank you Freddie Dread.
[7948.26s -> 7954.28s]  We caught it but just want to say
[7954.28s -> 7956.96s]  thanks again.
[7956.96s -> 7958.96s]  Daffy Jones thanks for the 500 bits.
[7958.96s -> 7960.96s]  They say, please get well soon Jerma.
[7960.96s -> 7962.96s]  Let us pray together for your swift recovery.
[7962.96s -> 7964.96s]  Our boomer who streamed from Vegas
[7964.96s -> 7966.96s]  ancient by thy name thy
[7966.96s -> 7968.96s]  carnival come thy jokes be repeats
[7968.96s -> 7970.96s]  on earth as it is in Jupiter
[7970.96s -> 7972.96s]  give us this day our daily laughs and forgive us of our
[7972.96s -> 7974.96s]  minus twos as we forgive thy late
[7974.96s -> 7976.96s]  streams lead us not into Cox
[7976.96s -> 7978.96s]  high speed internet but deliver us from
[7978.96s -> 7982.16s]  yellow skin. Amen.
[7982.16s -> 7986.84s]  Those of you that missed the beginning of the stream.
[7986.84s -> 7990.10s]  I had a weird
[7990.10s -> 7992.10s]  scare today.
[7992.10s -> 7994.34s]  That, just kind of have to go watch it.
[7994.34s -> 7997.99s]  It's a long winded thing.
[7997.99s -> 7999.99s]  I can't even explain what it was.
[7999.99s -> 8003.00s]  It's too long.
[8003.00s -> 8006.26s]  But thank you Daffy Jones. Appreciate that.
[8006.26s -> 8008.50s]  Tingy thanks for the 250. Jerma before
[8008.50s -> 8010.50s]  you get the liver scan go to the grocery store
[8010.50s -> 8012.50s]  buy the freshest liver you can and
[8012.50s -> 8014.50s]  get the doctor to scan that.
[8014.50s -> 8016.50s]  He'll get back to you with healthy results and you'll feel better in no time.
[8016.50s -> 8018.50s]  Those livers
[8018.50s -> 8020.50s]  Those livers are dead.
[8020.50s -> 8024.47s]  I don't think that's a good idea.
[8024.47s -> 8033.67s]  But healthy. Deadly healthy.
[8033.67s -> 8038.34s]  Thank you Tingy.
[8038.34s -> 8041.22s]  Thank you C4G for the 350.
[8041.22s -> 8043.46s]  Guitarra Man was
[8043.46s -> 8045.46s]  one of the first games I owned and I think the very first
[8045.46s -> 8047.46s]  game I actually beat.
[8047.46s -> 8049.46s]  I love this game and I can't wait to see you 100%
[8049.46s -> 8051.46s]  every level first try. And then they do the
[8051.46s -> 8057.92s]  that's me face.
[8057.92s -> 8061.83s]  It was fun. It was just maybe the
[8061.83s -> 8063.83s]  controller I was using. I still can't believe that I could have used
[8063.83s -> 8065.83s]  the Playstation 1 controller and it was right behind me the whole time.
[8065.83s -> 8067.83s]  It was just right under my nose.
[8067.83s -> 8070.71s]  Moo means Moo thanks for the 500
[8070.71s -> 8072.71s]  bits Moo. Kim could probably
[8072.71s -> 8074.71s]  save a lot of time and emotional labor
[8074.71s -> 8076.71s]  by just buying one of those rubber jar toppers
[8076.71s -> 8078.71s]  if she needed jars opened.
[8078.71s -> 8082.23s]  Yeah but then I can't be, I can't open it on stream
[8082.23s -> 8084.23s]  and look strong.
[8084.23s -> 8088.50s]  Hey Spooky Spitfire thanks
[8088.50s -> 8090.50s]  for the 250. So first things first
[8090.50s -> 8092.50s]  I'm done with Dark Souls 3
[8092.50s -> 8094.50s]  on my run. I had beat Orphan first
[8094.50s -> 8098.34s]  try. I don't know how you did that.
[8098.34s -> 8100.34s]  I've never beaten Orphan before which is even more surprising.
[8100.34s -> 8102.34s]  How do you beat Orphan first try?
[8102.34s -> 8109.75s]  That shit is like impossible.
[8109.75s -> 8111.75s]  They said also I had you muted
[8111.75s -> 8113.75s]  your stream and played Ludwig's theme over
[8113.75s -> 8115.75s]  it and it made the first music fight a million
[8115.75s -> 8118.50s]  times better. Did it match
[8118.50s -> 8126.18s]  up though? That's more important I think.
[8126.18s -> 8128.48s]  Just don't get hit. Yeah but
[8128.48s -> 8132.96s]  that's hard. Thank you Spooky Spitfire
[8132.96s -> 8136.29s]  I appreciate it. Yeah Orphan of Kos
[8136.29s -> 8138.53s]  what do you think I was talking about?
[8138.53s -> 8142.88s]  Good luck for the rest of your
[8142.88s -> 8146.98s]  you got anything else to do?
[8146.98s -> 8148.98s]  Oh you gotta do Sekiro now. Uh oh.
[8148.98s -> 8154.72s]  Good luck. Thank you back in for the 250.
[8154.72s -> 8156.72s]  Thank you for streaming as always. You never cease to entertain.
[8156.72s -> 8158.72s]  It's my birthday today and I want to thank
[8158.72s -> 8160.72s]  Stevie the
[8160.72s -> 8163.09s]  xEV
[8163.09s -> 8165.09s]  for helping out. Also have a great one chat.
[8165.09s -> 8169.56s]  Alright. Happy birthday.
[8169.56s -> 8173.70s]  Hope you had a good one.
[8173.70s -> 8177.54s]  And thanks Stevie for helping out.
[8177.54s -> 8181.89s]  Appreciate it. That guy Tag
[8181.89s -> 8184.96s]  gave
[8184.96s -> 8187.14s]  twenty dollars
[8187.14s -> 8190.34s]  two thousand bits.
[8190.34s -> 8193.03s]  They say Jerm hello Jerm this is
[8193.03s -> 8195.03s]  one of my favorite games ever made.
[8195.03s -> 8198.36s]  The PS2 version has iffy controls
[8198.36s -> 8200.36s]  the PSP version does the best. I still
[8200.36s -> 8203.30s]  play it to this day. It was awesome.
[8203.30s -> 8205.30s]  It was great. I mean back then
[8205.30s -> 8207.48s]  that was
[8207.48s -> 8212.66s]  pretty well done. But thanks a lot Tag.
[8212.66s -> 8219.06s]  No not the Rome game.
[8221.81s -> 8228.72s]  Yeah the Rome game.
[8228.72s -> 8230.72s]  No he's talking about Gitarro man.
[8230.72s -> 8237.32s]  Cause there's a
[8237.32s -> 8241.54s]  should I? No.
[8241.54s -> 8243.91s]  Rome game. Oh my fucking
[8243.91s -> 8250.82s]  god that's funny. Hamtaro
[8250.82s -> 8254.02s]  man? What are you guys
[8254.02s -> 8257.60s]  talking about? Isn't that
[8257.60s -> 8261.57s]  a hamster thing?
[8261.57s -> 8263.57s]  Anyways Tag thanks so much for the
[8263.57s -> 8265.57s]  twenty fucking dollars the two thousand bits.
[8265.57s -> 8275.86s]  Good to see you.
[8275.86s -> 8277.86s]  I was watching the tip of the hat
[8277.86s -> 8281.19s]  stream for a little bit. Tried to throw you
[8281.19s -> 8289.76s]  guys a host on Saturday. You guys
[8289.76s -> 8291.76s]  did a great fucking thing so
[8291.76s -> 8300.34s]  good on you guys. But that was Tag.
[8300.34s -> 8302.34s]  And by the way
[8302.34s -> 8304.34s]  go follow Tag. Please put
[8304.34s -> 8306.52s]  Tag's channel here.
[8306.52s -> 8312.02s]  Really really really
[8312.02s -> 8316.95s]  good dude. Alright I'll just do it.
[8316.95s -> 8328.34s]  I got it right here. Oh somebody did it first.
[8328.34s -> 8335.06s]  Who's today's top
[8335.06s -> 8340.50s]  subgifter? Me apparently.
[8340.50s -> 8342.50s]  But thanks Tag.
[8342.50s -> 8346.08s]  Go follow Tag if you don't.
[8346.08s -> 8348.08s]  Vilemi right after that gave
[8348.08s -> 8350.08s]  two thousand bits as well. Twenty dollars from
[8350.08s -> 8352.08s]  Vilemi right after that too.
[8352.08s -> 8354.08s]  Streamer is pretending to be bad.
[8354.08s -> 8358.63s]  And then they do Jermis Sauer.
[8358.63s -> 8360.63s]  He's pretending. He's always
[8360.63s -> 8362.63s]  pretending. That's just what he does. He just pretends
[8362.63s -> 8364.80s]  to miss keys.
[8364.80s -> 8366.80s]  He pretends to
[8366.80s -> 8368.80s]  get hit and fall off cliffs.
[8368.80s -> 8370.80s]  That's what he does. He's a pretender.
[8370.80s -> 8372.80s]  He's a liar. Don't trust
[8372.80s -> 8374.80s]  him. Don't trust anything he says.
[8374.80s -> 8382.60s]  No thank you though. Thanks for the
[8382.60s -> 8384.60s]  twenty fucking dollars. Thank you
[8384.60s -> 8386.60s]  Multitrip for the 250 worst sounding stream
[8386.60s -> 8389.73s]  2019. I get it
[8389.73s -> 8391.73s]  because of the guitar. Okay.
[8391.73s -> 8393.91s]  Thanks for the 250. Appreciate it.
[8393.91s -> 8395.91s]  Debockery man thanks for the five hundred bits.
[8395.91s -> 8397.91s]  When's the Elite Beat Agent stream?
[8397.91s -> 8401.68s]  I need to compile a bunch of stuff
[8401.68s -> 8404.69s]  for the DS.
[8404.69s -> 8407.19s]  And get it captured.
[8407.19s -> 8409.56s]  I think there's a way you can mod a DS and have
[8409.56s -> 8414.93s]  it capturable. Because I know
[8414.93s -> 8416.93s]  emulators exist and I have used them before.
[8416.93s -> 8419.24s]  But there's something
[8419.24s -> 8421.24s]  different about them.
[8421.24s -> 8423.24s]  And sometimes it can be hard to set up.
[8423.24s -> 8425.24s]  Especially when you get towards the PS2, PS3 stuff.
[8425.24s -> 8428.12s]  I know that these games are all
[8428.12s -> 8430.12s]  emulatable but I like playing on original
[8430.12s -> 8432.48s]  hardware. I actually do like doing
[8432.48s -> 8434.48s]  it. It just kind of feels better
[8434.48s -> 8437.24s]  to me. Modding the DS
[8437.24s -> 8439.24s]  is a crime. It is?
[8439.24s -> 8447.16s]  Why? Wait I can't like put
[8447.16s -> 8449.16s]  a capture card in a DS? Why is that illegal?
[8449.16s -> 8458.63s]  Well, but I do
[8458.63s -> 8460.63s]  like playing on mostly if I can original
[8460.63s -> 8465.43s]  hardware. If it's possible.
[8465.43s -> 8470.80s]  Modifying the software.
[8470.80s -> 8472.80s]  Well then I'll put my webcam at it. Whatever who cares.
[8472.80s -> 8474.80s]  We'll go back to like fucking 2009.
[8474.80s -> 8483.83s]  Yet you got a fake PS2
[8483.83s -> 8485.83s]  controller. No I have a real PS1
[8485.83s -> 8487.83s]  controller back there but a fake PS2
[8487.83s -> 8489.83s]  controller because
[8489.83s -> 8492.20s]  that's what it came with. And I was
[8492.20s -> 8494.20s]  too lazy to go get like the real play.
[8494.20s -> 8496.20s]  It's a real PlayStation. It's just an off-brand
[8496.20s -> 8503.94s]  one. Thank you debauchery man.
[8503.94s -> 8505.94s]  Maybe at some point in the future.
[8505.94s -> 8508.31s]  We'll see. C4G thanks for the 250.
[8508.31s -> 8510.31s]  I don't know how you managed to do that with your
[8510.31s -> 8512.31s]  wonky sticks but I'm glad we got to hear
[8512.31s -> 8514.31s]  all the bangers. Most of them anyways.
[8514.31s -> 8516.31s]  A couple of notes got lost in the process.
[8516.31s -> 8518.31s]  I really wish this got a re-release
[8518.31s -> 8520.31s]  for modern systems because I really love
[8520.31s -> 8523.06s]  this game. Thanks for showing it.
[8523.06s -> 8525.06s]  I think the rhythm game is
[8525.06s -> 8527.06s]  due for a big comeback.
[8527.06s -> 8532.63s]  And I'm not talking about
[8532.63s -> 8536.79s]  Guitar Hero. I'm talking
[8536.79s -> 8538.79s]  the original
[8538.79s -> 8541.28s]  rhythm game stuff.
[8541.28s -> 8546.28s]  And it looks like the
[8546.28s -> 8548.28s]  initial tremors are starting
[8548.28s -> 8551.28s]  here. You've got Space Channel
[8551.28s -> 8553.28s]  5 isn't that making a comeback?
[8553.28s -> 8557.83s]  Isn't there a new rhythm heaven game?
[8557.83s -> 8559.83s]  Or didn't one just recently release
[8559.83s -> 8564.82s]  or one's coming out? Guitar
[8564.82s -> 8566.82s]  Hero 1 and 2 was fun. No I
[8566.82s -> 8568.82s]  mean those games were so much fun
[8568.82s -> 8570.82s]  but licensed video game
[8570.82s -> 8572.82s]  soundtracks. You know what I mean?
[8572.82s -> 8574.82s]  You're actually playing the guitar
[8574.82s -> 8576.82s]  to Van Halen.
[8576.82s -> 8578.82s]  Not a Parappa the Rappa style original
[8578.82s -> 8580.82s]  songs with a little fun
[8580.82s -> 8582.82s]  cute original storyline.
[8582.82s -> 8589.09s]  I think you'll see a little bit more of that
[8589.09s -> 8594.85s]  comeback. It goes in cycles.
[8594.85s -> 8597.92s]  Derma sounds so constipated.
[8597.92s -> 8602.21s]  Look I know
[8602.21s -> 8604.21s]  that's like a meta joke
[8604.21s -> 8606.21s]  reference. That's a meta reference
[8606.21s -> 8608.21s]  to the fact that you found out today
[8608.21s -> 8610.21s]  that I'm on prescription grade
[8610.21s -> 8612.21s]  laxatives. I know that that's why
[8612.21s -> 8614.21s]  you're saying that. And you've
[8614.21s -> 8616.21s]  turned it. You've turned the key here.
[8616.21s -> 8620.24s]  Now I'm angry. I'm angry with you.
[8620.24s -> 8622.24s]  I'm angry with you.
[8622.24s -> 8625.19s]  What do you care?
[8625.19s -> 8629.33s]  First it's just like
[8629.33s -> 8631.33s]  what do I fucking care?
[8631.33s -> 8636.95s]  Nah I'm just kidding. Anyways
[8636.95s -> 8640.28s]  where were we? Over here.
[8640.28s -> 8642.28s]  Snowflakes. Am I
[8642.28s -> 8644.28s]  right? For 250 thanks for the 250.
[8644.28s -> 8647.67s]  Yo Jeremy your streams have been a comfort
[8647.67s -> 8649.67s]  of mine for a while. I made some
[8649.67s -> 8651.67s]  portraits of you and Kim cause why
[8651.67s -> 8653.67s]  not? Here they are. I'll upload them to my Insta
[8653.67s -> 8655.67s]  if you are still chill with that.
[8655.67s -> 8659.06s]  Thanks for the laughs. Throw these into
[8659.06s -> 8661.06s]  the community content night channel.
[8661.06s -> 8668.66s]  Toss them in there.
[8668.66s -> 8670.66s]  We'll pull them out during that next night.
[8670.66s -> 8672.66s]  Which will probably be
[8672.66s -> 8679.11s]  pretty soon actually.
[8679.11s -> 8681.11s]  Let me see. What day
[8681.11s -> 8685.40s]  is it? Today's the 19th.
[8685.40s -> 8687.83s]  I would probably say
[8687.83s -> 8689.83s]  somewhere. Maybe there's enough to do it
[8689.83s -> 8691.83s]  before Halloween.
[8691.83s -> 8703.46s]  It's possible.
[8703.46s -> 8705.96s]  Monday and then
[8705.96s -> 8708.96s]  24, 25, 26.
[8711.33s -> 8713.33s]  Let me see.
[8713.33s -> 8715.33s]  If I can't do it before
[8715.33s -> 8717.33s]  the Halloween stream happens. Then it'll be
[8717.33s -> 8719.33s]  early November for sure. But
[8719.33s -> 8721.51s]  those of you
[8721.51s -> 8723.51s]  that I guess. I actually have to put this
[8723.51s -> 8725.51s]  down in the
[8725.51s -> 8727.51s]  description down below.
[8727.51s -> 8729.51s]  That artwork and videos
[8729.51s -> 8731.51s]  are not going to be opened at the end of
[8731.51s -> 8733.51s]  streams anymore. They're going to go
[8733.51s -> 8735.51s]  into that Discord channel.
[8735.51s -> 8737.51s]  If you have anything that you want to
[8737.51s -> 8739.51s]  show on stream, we do a community
[8739.51s -> 8741.51s]  content night once a month.
[8741.51s -> 8743.51s]  Where we compile all
[8743.51s -> 8745.51s]  of them and we go through and we have a whole stream where
[8745.51s -> 8747.51s]  everybody comes and hangs out there.
[8747.51s -> 8750.00s]  Rather than have at the end of
[8750.00s -> 8752.00s]  streams, you know
[8752.00s -> 8754.00s]  30, 40, 50% of people will
[8754.00s -> 8756.00s]  take off because obviously it's like oh the stream's
[8756.00s -> 8758.00s]  over. I got all the shit I want to do and
[8758.00s -> 8760.00s]  see you later. But that's, you know, that's fine, right?
[8760.00s -> 8762.00s]  So
[8762.00s -> 8765.46s]  that was kind of the idea is to have them
[8765.46s -> 8767.46s]  all compiled rather than have them open at
[8767.46s -> 8770.21s]  the end of the stream. But
[8770.21s -> 8772.21s]  please, please, please put them in that community content
[8772.21s -> 8774.21s]  on the Discord. If you don't know what the Discord is
[8774.21s -> 8776.21s]  it's right here. It's a public
[8776.21s -> 8779.60s]  open Discord. Join
[8779.60s -> 8782.36s]  it. It's a great community.
[8782.36s -> 8784.60s]  Look forward to seeing what you do. And make sure
[8784.60s -> 8786.60s]  you watermark all your shit
[8786.60s -> 8789.67s]  so I know who it's from. Very important.
[8789.67s -> 8794.40s]  But thank you so much. I look forward to seeing it.
[8794.40s -> 8799.52s]  Thank you for the 250.
[8799.52s -> 8803.99s]  Really. Plank V2, thanks
[8803.99s -> 8805.99s]  for the 1100
[8805.99s -> 8807.99s]  bits. Fun fact,
[8807.99s -> 8809.99s]  gladiators didn't die every fight
[8809.99s -> 8811.99s]  because they were too expensive to replace.
[8811.99s -> 8821.38s]  It's a fact I guess. Is that true?
[8821.38s -> 8825.40s]  Interesting. Thank you Plank
[8825.40s -> 8827.40s]  for the 11 dollars.
[8827.40s -> 8830.98s]  Look directly at the Discord channel when I do it next time?
[8830.98s -> 8834.31s]  Yeah, but then I have to like cap
[8834.31s -> 8836.31s]  Discord. And you
[8836.31s -> 8838.31s]  can't really like full screen Discord.
[8838.31s -> 8840.31s]  It's still messages that you have to open.
[8840.31s -> 8842.31s]  And I'd rather just do it the way
[8842.31s -> 8847.56s]  that I did before. Gladiators weren't
[8847.56s -> 8850.37s]  real. What? Hey,
[8850.37s -> 8852.37s]  Appleship, thanks for the 250. Hey man, I need to submit my
[8852.37s -> 8854.37s]  senior quote for the yearbook by the end of November.
[8854.37s -> 8856.37s]  Can you come up with one for me? Choose wisely.
[8856.37s -> 8858.37s]  This will be my high school legacy forever.
[8858.37s -> 8863.48s]  Um, okay.
[8863.48s -> 8868.40s]  Use this one. Start the
[8868.40s -> 8873.84s]  quote. Keep your eyes on the prize.
[8873.84s -> 8875.84s]  The road to success
[8875.84s -> 8877.84s]  is always under construction.
[8877.84s -> 8885.59s]  Pretty fucking goddamn good
[8885.59s -> 8894.23s]  if you ask me.
[8894.23s -> 8896.23s]  Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring,
[8896.23s -> 8898.23s]  boring, boring.
[8898.23s -> 8900.23s]  That's what my mother used to say to me.
[8900.23s -> 8902.40s]  That's a quote from my mother.
[8902.40s -> 8904.40s]  You making fun of my mother?
[8904.40s -> 8906.40s]  You making fun of my mother? Mrs. Elberton?
[8906.40s -> 8917.35s]  I didn't end quote yet.
[8917.35s -> 8920.61s]  Oh, well, end it.
[8920.61s -> 8922.92s]  There.
[8922.92s -> 8927.59s]  That's not a good quote.
[8927.59s -> 8929.59s]  That's not a good quote.
[8929.59s -> 8931.59s]  That's too long for a yearbook.
[8931.59s -> 8937.67s]  You can't use that
[8937.67s -> 8939.67s]  one. Use the first part of that that I said.
[8939.67s -> 8941.67s]  Not the other end of it.
[8941.67s -> 8945.19s]  Oh god. Well, anyways,
[8945.19s -> 8947.49s]  congratulations.
[8947.49s -> 8950.12s]  Take care. Thank you, Appleship.
[8950.12s -> 8956.00s]  Hey!
[8956.00s -> 8958.00s]  Heavy Min, thanks for the
[8958.00s -> 8960.00s]  500 bits. I would absolutely love to see you play Dead
[8960.00s -> 8962.00s]  Rising, genuinely my favorite game of all
[8962.00s -> 8964.00s]  time. I even did all the awful
[8964.00s -> 8966.00s]  awful achievements for it, including the survive
[8966.00s -> 8968.00s]  for 14 literal hours
[8968.00s -> 8970.69s]  by doing nothing one.
[8970.69s -> 8972.69s]  That's gonna be a really, really
[8972.69s -> 8974.69s]  fun stream.
[8974.69s -> 8976.69s]  Because don't you have to make choices on who
[8976.69s -> 8978.69s]  survives and stuff?
[8978.69s -> 8985.09s]  And it's a time limit, right?
[8985.09s -> 8987.72s]  Yeah, that's gonna be a ton of fun.
[8987.72s -> 8994.31s]  I'm gonna do that sooner rather than later.
[8994.31s -> 8996.61s]  That might end up happening before Halloween.
[8996.61s -> 9002.18s]  I've never played it. I've seen people
[9002.18s -> 9004.68s]  play that game. And me and
[9004.68s -> 9006.68s]  Star played Dead Rising 2?
[9006.68s -> 9008.68s]  Dead Rising 3? But we didn't even get
[9008.68s -> 9010.92s]  out of the fucking first room.
[9010.92s -> 9012.92s]  I think we made it 10 minutes into
[9012.92s -> 9014.92s]  the game and we were just throwing shit at each other.
[9014.92s -> 9019.01s]  I don't remember. There's a video on it.
[9019.01s -> 9021.38s]  I think it was 2. Yeah, I've never played the first one.
[9021.38s -> 9029.51s]  I've played Dead Rising 3
[9029.51s -> 9032.58s]  as well. I've played every
[9032.58s -> 9034.58s]  Dead Rising game for like 2 hours each.
[9034.58s -> 9036.58s]  Except for the first one.
[9036.58s -> 9040.80s]  Dead Rising 4? I don't even remember
[9040.80s -> 9042.98s]  which one it was. Hey, Master
[9042.98s -> 9044.98s]  Chicken, thanks for the 1500 bits. 15 bucks
[9044.98s -> 9046.98s]  from Master Chicken, thank you.
[9046.98s -> 9048.98s]  Jeremiah, I almost pissed my pants when the disc started skipping.
[9048.98s -> 9050.98s]  There are tears pouring down my face.
[9050.98s -> 9054.24s]  I mean, it was fucking crazy.
[9054.24s -> 9056.24s]  So, I...
[9056.24s -> 9063.16s]  Hopefully you're alright.
[9063.16s -> 9065.16s]  Thank you to Funky Chicken for the 300 bits.
[9065.16s -> 9067.16s]  If Steve is short
[9067.16s -> 9069.16s]  for Stevious,
[9069.16s -> 9071.16s]  then Jerma is short for a
[9071.16s -> 9082.42s]  34-year-old man.
[9082.42s -> 9085.43s]  Nice. Got him. Yeah.
[9085.43s -> 9088.82s]  I mean, I'm gonna read it.
[9088.82s -> 9092.79s]  Whatever. I don't care.
[9092.79s -> 9094.79s]  Thank you JVibs for the
[9094.79s -> 9096.79s]  500 bits. Hey, Jerma, it's Josh.
[9096.79s -> 9098.79s]  We met in Las Vegas.
[9098.79s -> 9100.79s]  I finally used the Prime sub
[9100.79s -> 9102.79s]  like I promised. Keep on going strong.
[9102.79s -> 9105.78s]  I do remember that.
[9105.78s -> 9108.47s]  Kim and I were out to dinner.
[9108.47s -> 9110.47s]  We were trying to find new
[9110.47s -> 9114.44s]  places to go.
[9114.44s -> 9116.44s]  And this dude walked up to us.
[9116.44s -> 9118.44s]  By the way, this was like
[9118.44s -> 9124.00s]  last week.
[9124.00s -> 9128.29s]  No, not VR, Josh.
[9128.29s -> 9130.29s]  Kim and I were like, oh, where do you want to go?
[9130.29s -> 9132.29s]  Let's try some new places we fucking don't go.
[9132.29s -> 9136.56s]  I was like, oh, what about here?
[9136.56s -> 9139.06s]  How about here? How about there?
[9139.06s -> 9141.88s]  And then he flashed you.
[9141.88s -> 9147.83s]  No, that did not happen.
[9147.83s -> 9156.34s]  New places.
[9156.34s -> 9158.34s]  Right? The Vegas buffet is worst to best.
[9158.34s -> 9161.22s]  There's like
[9161.22s -> 9164.10s]  700 of them.
[9164.10s -> 9171.72s]  I can't do that.
[9171.72s -> 9174.34s]  Here's the thing about Vegas though.
[9174.34s -> 9176.58s]  Vegas has more restaurants and more places to eat
[9176.58s -> 9178.58s]  than any place I've ever been on Earth.
[9178.58s -> 9181.78s]  There are probably like
[9181.78s -> 9183.78s]  2,000 restaurants in Las Vegas.
[9183.78s -> 9186.60s]  It's fucking crazy.
[9186.60s -> 9189.60s]  It's overwhelming.
[9189.60s -> 9191.60s]  And they're all good.
[9191.60s -> 9193.60s]  They're all good except for, well, hold on.
[9193.60s -> 9202.55s]  I don't want to get ahead of myself there.
[9202.55s -> 9204.55s]  Do I have a Yeti restaurant?
[9204.55s -> 9207.62s]  Hash House to Go Go is the best restaurant I've ever been to.
[9207.62s -> 9209.80s]  In Vegas.
[9209.80s -> 9212.79s]  That's in the link.
[9212.79s -> 9214.79s]  Please, please go if you're ever in Vegas.
[9214.79s -> 9220.55s]  Do a Vegas restaurant tier list.
[9220.55s -> 9222.55s]  It would not happen.
[9222.55s -> 9225.62s]  But anyways, no, I do remember Kim and I were just like
[9225.62s -> 9227.62s]  walking around and it was just like, hey,
[9227.62s -> 9231.25s]  what's up?
[9231.25s -> 9233.25s]  And you used the prime sub like you promised.
[9233.25s -> 9235.81s]  That's fucking awesome.
[9235.81s -> 9237.81s]  It was a pleasure.
[9237.81s -> 9243.83s]  I was just saying hello, seriously.
[9243.83s -> 9245.83s]  Hope you had a good rest of your trip.
[9245.83s -> 9248.96s]  I know that you were on a trip.
[9248.96s -> 9252.04s]  You were just going to stop it in and
[9252.04s -> 9254.28s]  demand a sub from the guy.
[9254.28s -> 9258.88s]  No, that's not what happened.
[9258.88s -> 9261.32s]  Now, if anybody ever sees me,
[9261.32s -> 9263.32s]  and look, I know that
[9263.32s -> 9265.32s]  I currently live
[9265.32s -> 9267.88s]  in a destination city.
[9267.88s -> 9269.88s]  And there are a lot of places
[9269.88s -> 9271.88s]  that you could potentially just see me
[9271.88s -> 9274.24s]  because there's so much to do here.
[9274.24s -> 9277.51s]  There's a bunch
[9277.51s -> 9279.51s]  of stuff to do on strip. There's a bunch of stuff off
[9279.51s -> 9281.51s]  strip. There's a bunch of stuff downtown
[9281.51s -> 9283.51s]  and some of the other areas and towns
[9283.51s -> 9285.51s]  and communities and stuff.
[9285.51s -> 9287.68s]  So I know that there's a lot of
[9287.68s -> 9289.92s]  people that go to Vegas all the time.
[9289.92s -> 9291.92s]  People have said already
[9291.92s -> 9295.70s]  that, hey, I'm going to be in Vegas.
[9295.70s -> 9297.70s]  I'm going to be in Vegas. I'm going to be in Vegas. So if
[9297.70s -> 9299.70s]  you end up just seeing me somewhere,
[9299.70s -> 9304.12s]  do not hesitate to just say hello.
[9304.12s -> 9306.29s]  It's not going to bother me. Don't worry
[9306.29s -> 9316.40s]  about that. I was there in September, but I
[9316.40s -> 9321.59s]  didn't see him. What if I try
[9321.59s -> 9323.83s]  to bother you? Well, then
[9323.83s -> 9325.83s]  I will get security.
[9325.83s -> 9328.96s]  They're everywhere.
[9328.96s -> 9330.96s]  I will just go,
[9330.96s -> 9332.96s]  excuse me, sir.
[9332.96s -> 9334.96s]  This person's trying to bother me.
[9334.96s -> 9339.32s]  What do you mean he hates us? Somebody just
[9339.32s -> 9341.32s]  said, what if I was trying to bother
[9341.32s -> 9343.56s]  you? What does that mean?
[9343.56s -> 9346.63s]  What does that mean? That means you're trying to bother
[9346.63s -> 9348.63s]  me. Shouldn't I be like, hey, security?
[9348.63s -> 9355.92s]  What does that even mean?
[9355.92s -> 9361.43s]  Psycho
[9361.43s -> 9363.43s]  Streamer throws fans out from
[9363.43s -> 9370.02s]  the strip. Well, if you're going to
[9370.02s -> 9372.02s]  be like a dick
[9372.02s -> 9374.02s]  and not like leave me alone and be like
[9374.02s -> 9376.02s]  mean and like do fucking
[9376.02s -> 9378.02s]  awful shit and say awful, I'm going to be like, get
[9378.02s -> 9380.02s]  away from me. Like, oh, get the fuck out
[9380.02s -> 9383.80s]  of here. What do you want me to do?
[9383.80s -> 9385.80s]  What? That's like a
[9385.80s -> 9387.80s]  basic human thing.
[9387.80s -> 9389.80s]  If somebody walked up to you and was
[9389.80s -> 9391.80s]  like grabbing you and like fucking
[9391.80s -> 9393.80s]  screaming in your face and like peeking from
[9393.80s -> 9395.80s]  behind corners and like hiding from
[9395.80s -> 9397.80s]  you, looking at you to be like,
[9397.80s -> 9399.80s]  yeah, I'm coming
[9399.80s -> 9401.97s]  for you. You don't think you'd be
[9401.97s -> 9404.28s]  like, um, can
[9404.28s -> 9417.46s]  somebody help me here, please?
[9417.46s -> 9419.46s]  I'll call security on you.
[9419.46s -> 9424.18s]  That's not how it works.
[9424.18s -> 9426.18s]  Anyways, let's put the credits on. But
[9426.18s -> 9428.18s]  no, long story short, if you do see me out,
[9428.18s -> 9430.93s]  you know, if like me and Kim are like
[9430.93s -> 9432.93s]  trying a new restaurant or something and you see
[9432.93s -> 9434.93s]  us at the restaurant, then fucking
[9434.93s -> 9436.93s]  whatever. Just come say hello.
[9436.93s -> 9441.35s]  I'm totally alright with that.
[9441.35s -> 9448.84s]  Shout out to my favorite centipede
[9448.84s -> 9450.84s]  stream. What do you mean centipede?
[9450.84s -> 9460.16s]  What the fuck does that mean? Wormo.
[9460.16s -> 9463.62s]  Oh. Anyways, here come the credits.
[9463.62s -> 9466.05s]  Uh, thanks everybody for
[9466.05s -> 9468.05s]  your support, your continued support.
[9468.05s -> 9470.05s]  It means a fucking shitload.
[9470.05s -> 9472.05s]  Gotta bump ya. Sorry.
[9472.05s -> 9475.32s]  Oh fuck, I thought that was a webcam.
[9475.32s -> 9478.39s]  And I don't have any clothes on.
[9478.39s -> 9485.80s]  Alright, I'm good.
[9485.80s -> 9487.80s]  We're not watching the frog video again.
[9487.80s -> 9493.41s]  What you are gonna watch is
[9493.41s -> 9495.41s]  you're gonna watch this pop up.
[9495.41s -> 9502.05s]  Thanks everybody.
[9502.05s -> 9504.05s]  A couple more bits to do we have.
[9504.05s -> 9506.05s]  The ball of koala thanks to the five
[9506.05s -> 9508.05s]  hundred bits. Five fifty actually.
[9508.05s -> 9510.05s]  Hey Jerma put my broken
[9510.05s -> 9512.05s]  umjammer lambi disc up for sale online
[9512.05s -> 9514.05s]  and some idiot actually bought it.
[9514.05s -> 9517.44s]  Laughing my ass off, I scammed him.
[9517.44s -> 9524.87s]  Thanks. Well, enjoy your
[9524.87s -> 9526.87s]  like forty eight dollars,
[9526.87s -> 9529.75s]  whatever this was. I don't even remember.
[9529.75s -> 9533.14s]  Hey gnarly, thanks for the two fifty.
[9533.14s -> 9535.14s]  Hey, just making sure you met your quota for one
[9535.14s -> 9538.34s]  reference per stream of a certain
[9538.34s -> 9540.34s]  thing. I didn't hear one yet and
[9540.34s -> 9542.34s]  I don't want you to break your three year streak.
[9542.34s -> 9551.99s]  Not gonna happen. Thank you Freudian
[9551.99s -> 9553.99s]  Weapon for the five hundred bits.
[9553.99s -> 9560.96s]  Thank you. The game glitching out made
[9560.96s -> 9562.96s]  my night. My bro and I laughed so hard our heads
[9562.96s -> 9566.23s]  were hurting so thanks for the laughs.
[9566.23s -> 9571.80s]  I mean it was a shit show. I already
[9571.80s -> 9573.80s]  forgot your name, how to pronounce
[9573.80s -> 9576.61s]  it. I'm so sorry.
[9576.61s -> 9578.61s]  I remember like two days ago
[9578.61s -> 9580.61s]  I was corrected on this.
[9580.61s -> 9582.61s]  It's Czexin
[9582.61s -> 9584.61s]  S and I've already
[9584.61s -> 9590.93s]  forgot it. I don't remember.
[9590.93s -> 9595.54s]  Czexin? Czexin?
[9595.54s -> 9598.23s]  It was Czexin. Okay, right.
[9598.23s -> 9600.47s]  Right. Czexin.
[9600.47s -> 9603.28s]  I will remember next time, I promise.
[9603.28s -> 9605.28s]  Czexin gave five community subs.
[9605.28s -> 9609.57s]  Thanks for the five subs, Czexin.
[9609.57s -> 9612.84s]  And then we had don't start
[9612.84s -> 9614.84s]  let me
[9614.84s -> 9617.08s]  for the five hundred and fifty
[9617.08s -> 9619.08s]  bits. Play the yeti game, you'll get yeti
[9619.08s -> 9621.25s]  nightmares. I don't
[9621.25s -> 9624.58s]  know what that is. Why
[9624.58s -> 9629.89s]  is there a Terminator emote? Why is there
[9629.89s -> 9631.89s]  a Terminator emote? That's like not
[9631.89s -> 9633.89s]  even the Terminator. That's like the Mortal
[9633.89s -> 9635.89s]  Combat DLC Terminator.
[9635.89s -> 9640.56s]  DinoPulseZetta
[9640.56s -> 9642.56s]  thanks for the five community subs
[9642.56s -> 9644.56s]  right now. Thank you.
[9644.56s -> 9652.55s]  Appreciate it. Thanks for the five subs.
[9652.55s -> 9655.30s]  Ishanji
[9655.30s -> 9657.30s]  thanks for the two thousand bits
[9657.30s -> 9659.30s]  twenty dollars. Hey funny streamer
[9659.30s -> 9661.30s]  Jeremy. Love your streams.
[9661.30s -> 9663.30s]  Never seen anyone so determined to finish a physically defective
[9663.30s -> 9665.48s]  game before. Well I
[9665.48s -> 9668.61s]  bought it. Yeah look
[9668.61s -> 9670.61s]  okay hold on. It's real easy to be like
[9670.61s -> 9672.61s]  just like skip this one.
[9672.61s -> 9674.92s]  Just throw it in the trash.
[9674.92s -> 9677.22s]  Break it. Burn it. I
[9677.22s -> 9679.22s]  bought this game. I don't want to just like
[9679.22s -> 9681.22s]  break it.
[9681.22s -> 9683.46s]  I mean if it was Guy Fieri
[9683.46s -> 9685.46s]  the Guy Fieri game who cares?
[9685.46s -> 9691.48s]  I've just
[9691.48s -> 9693.48s]  look I've only destroyed
[9693.48s -> 9695.48s]  two or three games on stream ever in
[9695.48s -> 9697.48s]  like six years. Eight. No like
[9697.48s -> 9699.84s]  ten years. The Guy Fieri
[9699.84s -> 9702.08s]  minute to win it game
[9702.08s -> 9704.26s]  I shredded. Okay?
[9704.26s -> 9706.26s]  Which by the way do not do that. Don't try that
[9706.26s -> 9708.26s]  at home. It's not safe. Do not shred
[9708.26s -> 9710.26s]  anything that unless
[9710.26s -> 9712.26s]  you are certain that it is a
[9712.26s -> 9714.26s]  shredder that is capable of doing what you are trying
[9714.26s -> 9716.26s]  to do. Read the instructions.
[9716.26s -> 9718.63s]  Don't do that at home first of all.
[9718.63s -> 9720.63s]  Second of all Army of Two
[9720.63s -> 9722.63s]  was the other one that I broke in half.
[9722.63s -> 9728.32s]  I've never broken another game
[9728.32s -> 9730.56s]  on stream in at least in
[9730.56s -> 9732.56s]  the four and a half years plus that I've done this.
[9732.56s -> 9737.68s]  So come on I don't break
[9737.68s -> 9744.60s]  games. And then so the
[9744.60s -> 9746.84s]  second part here
[9746.84s -> 9748.84s]  any chance you'll stream tale of the sun
[9748.84s -> 9750.84s]  someday. It's a PS1
[9750.84s -> 9752.84s]  caveman simulator where you try to build
[9752.84s -> 9754.84s]  a tower to the sun out of mammoth
[9754.84s -> 9757.46s]  bones. Well you
[9757.46s -> 9759.46s]  just put a new game on the list.
[9759.46s -> 9763.11s]  And they say one of the more unique games on
[9763.11s -> 9765.11s]  the system. Also here's a clip to commemorate
[9765.11s -> 9767.11s]  your legendary freestyle today.
[9767.11s -> 9770.76s]  Your legendary freestyle
[9770.76s -> 9779.01s]  today. What was my
[9779.01s -> 9781.01s]  legendary freestyle?
[9781.01s -> 9783.64s]  Then I'll come
[9783.64s -> 9785.64s]  Then I'll come
[9785.64s -> 9788.26s]  Oh right
[9788.26s -> 9790.50s]  right. We don't have to
[9790.50s -> 9793.51s]  listen to this. It happened already.
[9793.51s -> 9796.58s]  Thanks.
[9796.58s -> 9801.43s]  We don't have to listen to that.
[9801.43s -> 9803.99s]  Thanks for the
[9803.99s -> 9805.99s]  20
[9805.99s -> 9807.99s]  Thanks for the 20 dollars seriously. 2,000 bits.
[9807.99s -> 9811.12s]  And I'll put that on the list, tale of the sun.
[9811.12s -> 9813.12s]  Next time I'll do some PS1 stuff for sure.
[9813.12s -> 9816.64s]  Sir Canine, thanks for the
[9816.64s -> 9820.61s]  500 bits. They say
[9820.61s -> 9822.61s]  Hey Jeremy, here's a funny video.
[9822.61s -> 9825.43s]  Videos go in the
[9825.43s -> 9827.43s]  community content night.
[9827.43s -> 9829.43s]  If it's about the community. But I know it's not.
[9829.43s -> 9831.67s]  Because I have
[9831.67s -> 9833.84s]  memorized the like
[9833.84s -> 9835.84s]  first five
[9835.84s -> 9838.02s]  letters of this link.
[9838.02s -> 9840.02s]  And I know what it is. It is this.
[9840.02s -> 9843.99s]  I know what it is already.
[9843.99s -> 9850.63s]  So that's fine.
[9850.63s -> 9857.27s]  I'm prepared. But thank you
[9857.27s -> 9859.27s]  Sir Canine for the five dollars. And then finally
[9859.27s -> 9861.70s]  Colusia, thank you for the 300
[9861.70s -> 9864.52s]  bits. The stream made me laugh so hard my
[9864.52s -> 9866.52s]  sides are killing me. Thank you Jerma. Also here's a picture
[9866.52s -> 9868.52s]  of my cat cuddling my
[9868.52s -> 9871.46s]  Andy Mark Goat. What the
[9871.46s -> 9882.02s]  what the fuck? Hold on.
[9882.02s -> 9887.25s]  Holy shit.
[9887.25s -> 9908.05s]  Look. So sleepy.
[9908.05s -> 9910.68s]  That's cute. That's
[9910.68s -> 9913.68s]  really cute. Well thank you for this.
[9913.68s -> 9917.08s]  This is great.
[9917.08s -> 9924.29s]  Sleepy.
[9924.29s -> 9926.72s]  Thanks a lot though. Seriously.
[9926.72s -> 9928.72s]  And that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow
[9928.72s -> 9931.41s]  for Trine. Star and I are
[9931.41s -> 9933.59s]  going to play Trine.
[9933.59s -> 9937.17s]  We're going to do the three Triners. Expect
[9937.17s -> 9939.17s]  tomorrow to be more of just a chill out
[9939.17s -> 9942.69s]  stream. I would imagine.
[9942.69s -> 9946.71s]  We're just going to play Trine. The new one.
[9946.71s -> 9949.97s]  Take care guys. See you soon. See you tomorrow.
[9949.97s -> 9953.92s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[9953.92s -> 9956.36s]  And that is where we end
[9956.36s -> 9964.40s]  this stream. Goodnight guys.
