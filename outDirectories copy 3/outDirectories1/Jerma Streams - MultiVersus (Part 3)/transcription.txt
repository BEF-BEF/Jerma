[326.13s -> 329.38s]  has this dunk move that you
[329.38s -> 331.38s]  just need to touch somebody with it.

[374.85s -> 377.98s]  Instant loss incoming.
[377.98s -> 379.98s]  Well, now I gave myself an opportunity
[379.98s -> 381.98s]  for failure, which was a bad idea.
[393.42s -> 396.11s]  Here we go.
[396.11s -> 398.11s]  Don't get in my head already. I haven't even started playing.
[398.11s -> 400.74s]  Don't get in my head.
[400.74s -> 412.83s]  Let's go. Oh, what's that?

[907.39s -> 915.86s]  that clip back i'm up top and i go down and he goes down and i'm the one that goes down all right

[981.06s -> 991.10s]  beta now i wonder what they'll do i think it's going through august right we'll find out all
[991.10s -> 1083.46s]  right is what we've been trained i didn't want to do that move i need that ball oh my god just hit
[1083.46s -> 1140.53s]  the person oh it's not the move i wanted to do finally jesus i need that ball you're so
[1141.09s -> 1151.94s]  just useless without it in your hand i knew you were gonna do that night just pull together
[1174.34s -> 1249.17s]  didn't want to do that move that's it that's it that's not it oh damn it that's it
[1250.72s -> 1254.32s]  you cannot escape that's it
[1276.78s -> 1288.99s]  stupid oh my god oh it's so hard
[1292.02s -> 1298.08s]  shit that was a good match that was a good match good match good match we'll do it again
[1302.18s -> 1306.82s]  there's a lot of whiffs yeah i think with lebron is if you if you don't hit the basketball
[1308.98s -> 1319.71s]  you lose that's just the way it is but i like the way he plays it's funny why are you throwing
[1319.71s -> 1332.45s]  throwing i came back i was down by 80 points i came back i was down by 80 points i came back
[1338.56s -> 1354.82s]  just old man reactions do the air neutral more with uh with or without the ball from one to ten
[1354.82s -> 1363.02s]  how do you rate yourself as a gamer eight and a half super mario two dark souls games eight
[1365.25s -> 1394.98s]  and then it averages out after that oh my god i'm getting fucking annihilated oh my god i can't
[1394.98s -> 1413.31s]  even play the game how do i let him do that and does that move not go through anything
[1414.03s -> 1431.46s]  i feel like it doesn't that move doesn't go through anything
[1433.14s -> 1472.38s]  holy shit i can't get i can't get two out here jesus okay maybe it's not lebron
[1472.94s -> 1480.16s]  holy shit this guy's level one it doesn't make any sense it's this guy level one shaggy

[1494.74s -> 1504.88s]  we're gonna go back to bugs he was level 14 oh i thought he was level one i thought he was level
[1504.88s -> 1520.77s]  one okay back to bugs for a little while if you say so can you wish my dog a happy birthday we're
[1520.77s -> 1533.10s]  oh that's horrible happy birthday i'm sorry you're going through that to your dog you have to use an
[1533.10s -> 1545.17s]  s tier character everybody else is how much have you spent on skins i don't want to talk about it
[1545.73s -> 1558.51s]  uh none it's so nice he keeps letting his opponents win stop it i'm gonna just wait watch this one
[1558.51s -> 1690.93s]  here watch this one here watch this one here check this one out that is the question god damn it wrong
[1690.93s -> 1752.14s]  way sorry yes yes good fight good fight good fight good fight good fight very good fight
[1752.14s -> 1757.09s]  don't talk about how bad my lebron is ever again well you can because it was not very good
[1764.13s -> 1771.50s]  i feel like it just went cross-eyed into the camera did i go cross-eyed don't ever play lebron ever
[1771.50s -> 1777.71s]  again i like lebron it's in my title lebron's fun with the projectile but if you miss the ball you're
[1777.71s -> 1786.21s]  just you're just gonna lose i just gotta not miss the ball remember that was their first game you
[1786.21s -> 1799.57s]  don't know that dude you went green and your eyes bugged out wait what like the hulk how to train
[1799.57s -> 1817.65s]  your perks all right oh right you can buy ones can't you this one's good 20 reduction to ground
[1817.65s -> 1827.41s]  and ball bounce velocity all right let's go i got money four percent reduced incoming damage
[1827.97s -> 1835.57s]  15 percent increase base knockback influence that's kind of big that's actually really big
[1838.27s -> 1844.67s]  you should wear lebron jersey while you play as lebron yeah but if i'm gonna get destroyed i
[1844.67s -> 1857.98s]  can't uh air acceleration a little more offense i think that's fine for now that's cool though you
[1857.98s -> 1877.90s]  can do that all right this is what i get at level 10 that's kind of a big deal don't disappoint i
[1877.90s -> 1885.54s]  gotta try a few more games let me try lebron again we'll go in teams i'm gonna try lebron again i'm
[1885.54s -> 1901.65s]  telling you he's fun he's funny he's just kind of hard to play what's up doc no i voted already
[1901.65s -> 1920.05s]  this is teams this is gonna i'll be all right all right jake is really good projectile speed all
[1920.05s -> 1927.33s]  right let's go come on i'm telling you i know how to play lebron i promise that's a different
[1927.33s -> 1934.77s]  character whatever that's finn what i thought jake and finn from adventure time what's this
[1940.38s -> 1947.55s]  all right he's gonna eat the basketball isn't it a bunch it's gonna be bad jake the human and
[1947.63s -> 1956.64s]  in the dog i know all right here we go i'm going for it and we're gonna it's gonna be a good match
[1956.64s -> 1965.20s]  check it out i promise i promise it's gonna be a good match don't flip these cats in the bag
[1965.20s -> 1994.26s]  i've already fucked it up i must have spilled off the fucking stage what how did he eat me what's
[1994.26s -> 2023.73s]  going on here what just happened not bad that's how you drink whoa i went across the map in a
[2023.73s -> 2087.63s]  second something's going on here uh something's going on here what the hit that taz no where are
[2087.63s -> 2111.63s]  we we did it that was messy but we did it okay nice job good fight good fight continue
[2115.41s -> 2119.09s]  i got the kills that's all that matters all that matters is the uh the number at top
[2119.09s -> 2127.23s]  nothing else does choose your character hey dude just tuning in is this guy pro lebron
[2128.58s -> 2145.86s]  what's up doc you tested me today and i understand has his spin is op i think they nerfed it they uh
[2145.86s -> 2152.26s]  they made it way way less powerful in the last batch it's still really good but not as nearly
[2152.26s -> 2164.37s]  as good as it was it seems like they're really on top of patching the game every week or two
[2164.37s -> 2169.36s]  so that's good that's good every uh every week or two i see a new patch with nerfs and buffs and
[2169.36s -> 2187.28s]  stuff so it's good they're gonna make it a cool down move that makes sense it's only been one
[2187.28s -> 2200.08s]  week it's a lot of fun though be really honest with me how many you guys have ones in the chat
[2200.08s -> 2205.01s]  if you guys have actually downloaded this and went like this on the couch fuck it's good
[2206.38s -> 2212.80s]  wait be honest actually be honest that's what i did
[2235.17s -> 2249.50s]  oh all right oh my goodness i just got absolutely double teamed that move has no priority though
[2250.14s -> 2255.71s]  i mean i i get why it's so powerful but you got to catch people really off guard with it
[2260.27s -> 2264.43s]  you can pass the ball to your teammate too which is really cool oops i didn't want to do that
[2264.43s -> 2269.74s]  all right oh my god i thought it was over
[2294.02s -> 2313.60s]  i tried my hardest it's all right jump into it shit
[2326.40s -> 2354.99s]  oh you got so lucky there you go sir remember because you went in a fight against a grizzly bear
[2355.87s -> 2367.54s]  yep i think so when it just feels right i think enough like
[2373.18s -> 2379.15s]  you know like the every beat-em-up sound you've ever heard if the bear comes up with the claws
[2379.15s -> 2387.60s]  all i have to do is just go go go go go go go go go and i'll be able to knock him down
[2394.05s -> 2398.45s]  guys i would die instantly i would die in one hit the bear would swipe me across the face and my
[2398.45s -> 2406.61s]  face would come off of course i can't fight a bear i think i'm kidding it's a joke i would
[2406.61s -> 2418.37s]  get up with my hands like this and then my whole head would be gone but you can dodge an axe yeah
[2418.37s -> 2430.21s]  an axe is not a grizzly bear there of axe is not a a person has to swing the axe all right i want
[2430.21s -> 2443.26s]  to do all right lebron or or bugs you want to see more lebron gameplay he's so fun to play he
[2443.26s -> 2451.38s]  really is i just not very good with them lebron means you'll lose i just wanted to enroll lebron
[2451.38s -> 2464.54s]  on the team i'll do lebron again no time like the present tom and jerry i tried to play tom and jerry
[2464.54s -> 2469.71s]  they were kind of weird they remind me the ice climbers but you need to pay attention essentially
[2469.71s -> 2474.90s]  to both ice climbers at the same time it's like both it's like if you put the ice climbers away
[2474.90s -> 2483.78s]  from each other and they both have different moves it's uh if my brain just has trouble doing it
[2483.78s -> 2492.03s]  they're cool though should you purchase multiverses well multiverses is free an open beta right now
[2492.59s -> 2499.20s]  which by the way you have a moment or two this is a sponsored stream for multiverses
[2499.20s -> 2506.53s]  the game is uh is very good i don't need to tell you that twice it's currently an open beta cross

[3412.85s -> 3417.65s]  full episode of the office one day when ed helms was the guy that was in charge of everything and
[3417.65s -> 3436.77s]  i was like okay this is one full episode i watched that was a mistake i think the problem that i
[3436.77s -> 3448.40s]  have with the office is hold on steven universe's theme song is here turn it up wait let me turn it
[3448.40s -> 3453.74s]  up let me turn it up don't hit me yet let me turn up the sound don't hurt me yet i want to turn the

[3641.79s -> 3648.80s]  first 30 seconds i would have been way more closer somebody somebody watch what happened
[3649.70s -> 3657.62s]  how did six hairs get in my mouth how is it possible what did i do did i put my hand in my mouth

[4523.74s -> 4543.15s]  operation rabbit begin which which character should you pick uh whoever you whatever tv show
[4543.15s -> 4552.46s]  you like the most because that's how you get the power to play well see if you play as a
[4552.46s -> 4557.87s]  character which tv show you don't like you don't care if you win or lose but if you if it's a tv
[4557.87s -> 4561.95s]  show you really like you want bugs bunny to win because you love the looney tunes that's why i
[4561.95s -> 4593.58s]  always win with buggy's money all right let's go you're about to have a bad head what's going on

[4922.37s -> 4930.54s]  who cares about tier lists actually at least so far i feel like a lot of characters are viable
[4930.54s -> 4943.68s]  that's what it feels like show them what we got except the characters i play right i play i play
[4943.68s -> 4946.80s]  them because they're lower tier characters and that's why i lose like half the games
[4946.80s -> 5030.21s]  all right let's go oh and he eats cookies dude you can skateboard don't get too greedy here

[5250.18s -> 5254.45s]  versus lebron no complaining this time is just who's the better lebron that's all that matters

[5827.06s -> 5875.49s]  you can't guard me wrong way i hate when that happens it's so annoying hello what the hell is
[5875.49s -> 5974.70s]  that oh god we got this his hands are sweaty yes they are very sweaty superman seems fun
[5977.01s -> 5983.63s]  have you ever watched adventure time oh yeah it was on cartoon ever call the time
[5983.63s -> 5999.68s]  i was a fan i thought it was a good show time like the present that sounded dry what do you mean like

[6026.26s -> 6031.82s]  there's a dungeon they have to go through that lemon grab put them in or lemon grab was there
[6031.82s -> 6041.26s]  first and they get to the end of the dungeon um i did honestly i just have flashes of animated
[6041.26s -> 6098.86s]  sequences from that show i don't remember episodes three two good job good job shit
[6105.41s -> 6108.13s]  i could do this all night try me
[6116.30s -> 6153.49s]  yes drink some water i told you we got this this stage is broken for lebron yeah it is
[6154.54s -> 6160.77s]  just throwing the ball and not even caring about getting it back this is this is the lebron stage
[6160.77s -> 6171.70s]  without a doubt without a doubt also the um the scooby-doo stage is really good for lebron too
[6171.70s -> 6186.46s]  all right new character i will do a new character i promise i will here we go by the way multiverses
[6186.46s -> 6197.15s]  is in open beta right now and go get it steam xbox wait what is this here comes the heat
[6197.79s -> 6206.03s]  yeah thanks one of brothers again for sponsoring the stream and honestly at this is i'm really
[6206.03s -> 6212.30s]  happy because i actually genuinely love this game i think it's awesome i am so happy to be playing
[6212.30s -> 6223.33s]  this game because it's very good all right who do you who do you want to see me play let's put it
[6223.33s -> 6236.74s]  out there all right i'll get let's do a poll i'll give you guys a top four who i would actually
[6236.74s -> 6268.82s]  like to learn uh belma superman bin or batman let's get a poll up who do you want me to play
[6268.82s -> 6280.90s]  with i will unlock any of them in the meantime yeah i'll put the uh announcer on oh what's this
[6280.90s -> 6301.49s]  a sticker i can't even see who's winning who's winning i love this song in particular you know
[6301.49s -> 6309.58s]  the music in this game especially the main menu it reminds me of being at like six flags right and
[6309.66s -> 6316.16s]  you hear that music just playing everywhere you get a corn dog it feels very amusement parkish
[6316.16s -> 6327.70s]  i love it i feel like i'm at the in the line for the superman ride you know what i mean
[6327.70s -> 6349.09s]  i love it let's get a new emote wonder woman weightlifting all right i've got an 80 recent
[6349.09s -> 6362.80s]  win rate this is pretty good i'm only two million one hundred eighty nine thousand look at your
[6362.80s -> 6372.99s]  bugs bunny rank how do you do that all right because it looks like it's velma how do i see
[6372.99s -> 6401.36s]  the one v one all right let's take velma into the lab all right so velma's got a couple of cool
[6401.36s -> 6407.98s]  moves her basic attack is ranged so you have to target somebody and then you can just kind of pop
[6407.98s -> 6417.10s]  pop pop pop and then that's on cooldown all right let's see velma shouts a word bubble projectile
[6417.10s -> 6420.94s]  that seeks out her ally if the bubble hits any fighter ally or enemy they become targeted and
[6420.94s -> 6425.98s]  additional bubbles will lock on to their target their location allies who become targeted will
[6425.98s -> 6436.06s]  also briefly gain hastened all right so that's a support move so it's a heal all right so the
[6436.06s -> 6442.82s]  ammo which is replenished itself uh side x is a combo of quips yeah that move is good too this
[6442.82s -> 6451.12s]  one here that's what that could that i honestly think that's the best uh combo in the game it's
[6451.12s -> 6460.99s]  got such insane range look at the range on this like that's insane you can't get away from this
[6460.99s -> 6467.97s]  it takes a long time to charge up that shit so i'm not going to do it too much okay what about
[6467.97s -> 6479.39s]  down yeah this is the whack okay and the idea bubble you know what you really can do to screw
[6479.39s -> 6485.38s]  with somebody so you get them in the air and then just start throwing these out there and
[6485.38s -> 6495.78s]  just pop pop pop pop boom okay cool i like the combos what about the air moves whoa that's pretty
[6495.78s -> 6508.64s]  good that's just okay cool this one's like a dive it's got a lot of bounce to it and you can charge
[6508.64s -> 6518.59s]  this too that is a stuff move if you got somebody going around the corner here and you just stuff
[6518.59s -> 6526.40s]  right there okay what about specials so that i've said because you got to collect these things right
[6526.96s -> 6533.95s]  what does it do motivational speech beam projectile that repeatedly hits enemies and heals allies all
[6533.95s -> 6540.32s]  right the final hit of the beam applies targeted if the final hit lands on an ally it will fire
[6540.32s -> 6549.36s]  an additional beam okay or if it hits the full stack they get weakened okay you can aim the beam
[6549.36s -> 6561.39s]  up or down so it's just like a okay is this one too was this okay here we go yep is there a cool
[6561.39s -> 6578.51s]  down on that there is no cool down on that so dude all right target watch this well i screwed it up
[6578.51s -> 6588.35s]  you know what i mean that's i think that'd be pretty cool uh cool combo maybe not flashlight
[6588.35s -> 6595.76s]  okay cool so that's what that does you carry them over to the edge allies can hop into the arms to
[6596.50s -> 6604.02s]  increasing attack power all right toxic goop on the ground and jumps upward enemies standing in
[6604.02s -> 6611.74s]  the goop will receive continuous stacks of ice all right or it's you snap a picture
[6612.62s -> 6622.08s]  melma snaps a picture downward with a camera that sends her and enemies upward breaking armor applies
[6622.08s -> 6644.77s]  weak really that seems what's the range on it all right that seems insane that's a kill move
[6644.77s -> 6652.61s]  okay so that throws ice on the ground if you don't if you're not in the air so that i gotta
[6652.61s -> 6658.69s]  remember that down is spread the knowledge projectile that homes over an ally you get
[6658.69s -> 6663.71s]  educated if the book hits them reducing the duration of their cooldowns okay so when everything's on
[6663.71s -> 6672.80s]  cooldown you just kind of throw the book down all right i think i'm ready give it a try i think i'm
[6672.80s -> 6679.34s]  good to go wait is there anything else to look at all right during the match evidence will appear
[6679.34s -> 6686.11s]  and some of velma's moves spawn evidence so you can pick it up you fill the evidence meter so when
[6686.11s -> 6690.43s]  the meter is full velma can call a police car the police will seek out the nearest enemy disable
[6690.43s -> 6698.10s]  them and drive off the map and do it do this while crouching how do you activate that though

[7458.50s -> 7469.22s]  was like potentially powerful character it made me hate their fucking tv show or their game this
[7469.22s -> 7475.41s]  happened in smash too i would get like dominated by an olomar and i'd be like fuck that game that
[7475.41s -> 7482.64s]  game sucks or it even likes that game it would make me genuinely not like the media that it came
[7482.64s -> 7490.70s]  from so right now i like am never watching adventure time ever i'm gonna skip it every time it's on tv
[7496.75s -> 7512.72s]  come on pick character prepare for my dectifying exploits it's so good i know but you know what i

[7787.73s -> 7809.01s]  game time baby yeah i'm it's a great television show you're gonna do an apology video i actually
[7809.01s -> 7814.66s]  do like adventure time it's just okay so i could tell you if i play play play a fighting game and
[7814.66s -> 7822.70s]  i get destroyed it makes me hate that piece of media you need to apologize to finn and jake

[7971.76s -> 7991.49s]  it's coming in hot my head wasn't in the game my head was not in the game
[7998.51s -> 8001.02s]  i made a lot of mistakes at the end there
[8019.60s -> 8028.34s]  i'm here to fight for truth and justice what he sounds like was that superman talking was that
[8028.34s -> 8039.06s]  who was that all right i thought i thought that was batman talking i was like that's not the same
[8039.06s -> 8057.66s]  voice i don't know why i thought that was batman i was like that's he doesn't start time okay now
[8058.06s -> 8062.32s]  the voice is completely makes sense i just i don't know why batman was the one talking and
[8062.32s -> 8096.53s]  i'm like this doesn't really sound like me i'll beat you without oh they actually talk shit to each
[8096.53s -> 8112.59s]  other
[8143.23s -> 8187.28s]  should have gone up should have gone up what an idiot oh what a colossal fucking battle what a
[8187.28s -> 8248.86s]  colossal battle shit what the hell is going on here ah i could have went down stop talking
[8248.86s -> 8282.38s]  shit to me feel like you're in my chat that was your character i whatever i keep thinking it's
[8282.38s -> 8306.35s]  batman this is a fun game i'm telling you i'm so sweaty superman's really tanky very heavy
[8312.70s -> 8322.50s]  come on pick character let's do it again let's all fight fair and this should be fun how come you
[8322.50s -> 8343.31s]  look like you made it a soap i don't know i don't know do i it's kind of weird i gotta stop okay my
[8343.31s -> 8351.70s]  biggest problem with these games is panic dodging i get up there we get in the air and i just go oh
[8351.70s -> 8357.04s]  my god oh my god oh my god and i gotta stop doing that the panic dodges are what's getting me killed
[8357.04s -> 8374.74s]  are you gonna play anything else tonight probably not probably not we'll come back with uh we'll
[8374.74s -> 8386.03s]  come back with sorcery in a couple days maybe on uh monday i completely forgot i played the hitman
[8386.03s -> 8489.52s]  map that's weird walked away stay back oh i thought i got him really powerful actually powerful the
[8489.52s -> 8495.20s]  move his moves just hit so hard with those powers shaggy someone could get hurt play again
[8495.84s -> 8503.06s]  go ahead how come you went live when i went to the movies
[8505.38s -> 8507.92s]  because we were trying to get a stream in before you showed up
[8513.10s -> 8523.20s]  that was rude i'm just messing around of course i want everyone that's here to be here
[8525.52s -> 8531.47s]  it's me making a joke as long as i'm standing you can count on me oh when's green okay green
[8531.47s -> 8537.14s]  screen part two movie night is going to be on next weekend uh we're probably going to go on
[8537.14s -> 8542.66s]  friday or saturday so the fifth the sixth right let me see check the date it'll be the fifth of
[8542.66s -> 8549.86s]  the sixth we'll come back with another probably one to 200 videos gonna be insane and then sorcery

[8557.39s -> 8574.27s]  monday tuesday friday or monday tuesday saturday that makes sense to me you have a face filter on
[8574.27s -> 8600.29s]  no i've not seen a harley quinn in a long time
[8652.96s -> 8661.31s]  oh almost i'm goner i'm a goner
[8698.32s -> 8734.11s]  oh shit nice dodge damn i got outplayed too i really did i actually got outplayed that whole
[8734.11s -> 8741.20s]  entire game i just got a couple of uh good smashes that's it for someone without powers
[8741.20s -> 8756.96s]  you still pack quite the punch okay come on pick character he seems like he's pre-recorded
[8759.60s -> 8780.24s]  we'll do taz didn't i own taz did i not own taz before i have level three here comes the heat
[8785.46s -> 8796.86s]  oh is the free character rotation right that makes sense i think you might be stupid enough
[8796.86s -> 8821.86s]  to be a taz main show him what we got funny guy taz is low tier now i don't think so
[8852.29s -> 8953.89s]  how did i fuck that up holy shit what happened i told you we got this that was ridiculous what
[8953.89s -> 8977.49s]  happened just went flying that was insane i don't think i did that much damage dude it's you know
[8977.49s -> 8982.96s]  what it's fun to sit here and just play a video game and just try to play it well i feel like it's
[8982.96s -> 8990.00s]  been forever since i've tried to do this i feel like it's been ages since i've cared to play a
[8990.00s -> 8995.14s]  game and try to play it well does that make sense does anybody feel that way or am i just getting
[8995.14s -> 9000.85s]  old here comes the heat elden ring yeah i mean multiplayer though playing against somebody else
[9000.85s -> 9025.92s]  i'll do it again i'm not gonna play this game competitively ever i never will but i can't wait
[9025.92s -> 9032.74s]  to watch the people that do especially the teams there's no way they're not going to do some kind
[9032.74s -> 9039.22s]  of interesting stuff with the game right there's no way i'm looking forward to watching this game
[9039.22s -> 9063.57s]  oh all right i hope it's successful it's really great game i do too i hope it's successful as
[9063.57s -> 9071.38s]  well i mean it's gonna come down to how much support the game has in the next you know six
[9071.38s -> 9078.29s]  to twelve months looks like it has a lot i mean wasn't this one of the most played fighting games
[9078.37s -> 9082.85s]  ever on steam isn't i've never seen this like a screenshot am i wrong
[9150.26s -> 9152.05s]  all right all right
[9190.83s -> 9207.54s]  good combo good combo oh you're almost a snack you're almost the turkey turkey
[9233.06s -> 9262.21s]  oh shit i'm almost a turkey we got this and the turkey attack nope you can just run around
[9279.15s -> 9294.88s]  tasmanian andy i thought that was a good match i did i thought that was a good fight
[9294.88s -> 9317.76s]  here comes the heat adventure time i move around a lot i do i know when i play games like this i have
[9317.76s -> 9336.34s]  to move around it's the game the game is inside of me batman feels low tier to me is that wrong
[9336.34s -> 9350.67s]  to say like batman doesn't have very many moves doesn't feel high tier am i wrong he has trouble
[9350.67s -> 9367.30s]  killing at least in one v ones show them what we got batman is top you are ass you don't even
[9367.30s -> 9415.17s]  want you to give the screen turned off i think you're the toughest i've gone up against i try
[9415.17s -> 9443.55s]  to get it
[9481.63s -> 9491.23s]  i got i was getting juggled a lot too is there a campaign mode i don't think there is a campaign
[9491.23s -> 9508.13s]  mode nothing i'm aware of prepare for my debt defying exploits how can we always look so upset
[9511.39s -> 9518.00s]  i mean i i'm walking in gamer wise is that what it is you know holly said this to me too
[9518.56s -> 9523.52s]  she's like no seriously like if you watch you play a game that you're really really focusing on
[9524.16s -> 9531.92s]  it looks like you're going to headbutt the screen i'm just like what i just sit there like i have to
[9531.92s -> 9542.74s]  focus why is your chat so weird shall we dance i don't think they're that weird i mean some of
[9542.74s -> 9632.06s]  them are i wanted it so bad press the button we're even man we're even we both want the same
[9632.06s -> 9656.54s]  thing man it's not gonna happen to either one of us damn oh i'm in trouble i'm in trouble i'm in
[9656.54s -> 9699.92s]  trouble oh i almost got it no no no no no no no no that was a huge hitbox yeah it was
[9702.56s -> 9713.26s]  i'm having more fun watching you hop around in your seat i get i get really into this
[9713.26s -> 9728.58s]  shit man i'm sorry i really just do but it feels it feels good to play fighting games always play
[9728.58s -> 9735.14s]  like such ass online it's just i've never even cared i've never cared to even play one because
[9735.14s -> 9739.58s]  i'll jump into online and it's like why would i ever do this this sucks it doesn't feel like
[9739.58s -> 9744.06s]  that this game does not feel like that at all it just doesn't i have to be up front let's be
[9744.06s -> 9772.67s]  honest i'm here to defend justice the netcode yeah it's really hard to do it i mean look there's
[9772.67s -> 9776.91s]  been some times where the game's been a little laggy teleporting around and weird shit happening
[9776.91s -> 9783.30s]  but i would say 90 probably like 80 to 90 percent of all the games that i've played in this game
[9783.30s -> 9788.00s]  i've played pretty normally as if i was sitting next to the person that i was playing against
[9789.98s -> 9801.95s]  so that's encouraging and honestly the servers are are getting hammered right now
[9801.95s -> 9814.30s]  this just went into open beta there are a ton of people playing this game so it's
[9816.48s -> 9864.02s]  holding up pretty well let's go all right all right okay all right okay oh shit did i hit it
[9864.02s -> 9918.69s]  back at him damn it anti-superman land b yikes oh nice kick nice that was a good play that was
[9918.69s -> 9969.06s]  a good play it was what are we doing all right all right pull it together pull together that

[10013.71s -> 10020.50s]  actually fin is probably in a good place i would i would imagine they probably just need to they
[10020.50s -> 10030.85s]  need to bring a few people up i think genuinely i can't think of a character that i think is not
[10030.85s -> 10040.51s]  worth playing i don't think so i mean maybe lebron feels a little weak but his brand new character
[10041.15s -> 10053.70s]  who is genuinely terrible i don't think there's anybody that's genuinely awful rain dog is this
[10053.70s -> 10065.41s]  character not great wonder woman sucks really on team teams though rain dog is probably really
[10065.41s -> 10075.28s]  good aria feels really interesting too i want to try aria i was trained by the greatest swordsman
[10075.28s -> 10102.30s]  who ever lived cereal laurel oh here comes the heat steve is not uh good either it's fun to play

[13735.31s -> 13738.11s]  You jump again when you made the ledge and you just fall to your death.
[13738.11s -> 13739.11s]  Ah!
[13739.11s -> 13742.98s]  Here comes the heat!

[13754.76s -> 13755.94s]  I just...
[13755.94s -> 13758.14s]  I threw the ball and the ball was gone.
[13758.14s -> 13774.31s]  You look pale because this webcam is a piece of crap and it's like the most expensive webcam
[13774.31s -> 13780.10s]  you can possibly buy and it's worse than the one I had before and it overexposes you and
[13780.10s -> 13781.30s]  you can't do anything about it.
[13781.30s -> 13783.42s]  It's literally the worst webcam I've ever used.
[13783.42s -> 13801.25s]  It's a skill issue.
[13801.25s -> 13802.25s]  There's a DSLR.
[13802.25s -> 13803.25s]  I don't...
[13803.25s -> 13804.25s]  I don't...
[13804.25s -> 13805.25s]  I don't care.
[13805.25s -> 13810.53s]  I don't want to set up a big camera pointed over here and have the room heat up even more.
[13810.53s -> 13824.78s]  Alright, let's go.
[13824.78s -> 13847.08s]  Bro, I'm serious.
[13847.08s -> 13869.00s]  What is going on with my guy?
[13869.00s -> 13886.53s]  I'll do it again.
[13886.53s -> 13887.53s]  Don't do it again.
[13887.53s -> 13914.23s]  I almost had it again.
[13914.23s -> 13986.62s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this guy's just spamming his down smash move and it's
[13986.62s -> 13987.62s]  freaking me out.
[13987.62s -> 13991.65s]  Look, and he's just doing the down move and it's freaking us both out.
[13991.65s -> 13996.81s]  We can't do anything with him.
[13997.81s -> 14001.93s]  He's just going shrug, he almost did it too.
[14001.93s -> 14005.44s]  Oh my god, that was so close.
[14005.44s -> 14007.64s]  Oh my goodness, that's a good strategy.
[14007.64s -> 14009.64s]  That was seriously ridiculous.
[14009.64s -> 14022.35s]  Alright, this is it, this is the end.
[14022.35s -> 14028.13s]  Alright, we good?
[14028.13s -> 14029.13s]  Final one.
[14029.13s -> 14037.99s]  This is it.
[14037.99s -> 14051.94s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can and I'm going to try to win.
[14051.94s -> 14055.20s]  Don't throw, don't throw.
[14055.20s -> 14056.52s]  It's asking a lot.
[14056.52s -> 14059.07s]  You know what channel you're on.
[14059.07s -> 14061.95s]  The channel where we do that stuff.
[14061.95s -> 14067.26s]  Please be on Steven Universe.
[14067.26s -> 14074.39s]  Oh, okay.
[14074.39s -> 14086.27s]  My, I don't know what happened.
[14086.27s -> 14087.27s]  I'm serious.
[14087.27s -> 14088.99s]  I think I lagged out of the screen.
[14088.99s -> 14089.99s]  I didn't press that button.
[14089.99s -> 14090.99s]  Sorry.
[14090.99s -> 14091.99s]  We're fine.
[14091.99s -> 14092.99s]  We're fine.
[14092.99s -> 14108.95s]  Fine.
[14108.95s -> 14109.95s]  Relax.
[14109.95s -> 14111.70s]  It's a really bad start for both of us.
[14111.70s -> 14112.70s]  I don't know.
[14112.70s -> 14126.61s]  I get my game fucked up.
[14126.61s -> 14127.61s]  Oh, no.
[14127.61s -> 14129.29s]  Oh, no.
[14129.29s -> 14131.49s]  This was a disaster.
[14131.49s -> 14132.49s]  This was a disaster.
[14144.33s -> 14146.53s]  Wait, that was an absolute disaster.
[14146.53s -> 14149.57s]  I don't even know what happened, man.
[14149.57s -> 14151.57s]  We just, there's the same players.
[14151.57s -> 14153.01s]  What happened?
[14153.01s -> 14155.88s]  What even just happened?
[14155.88s -> 14157.40s]  More like world's greatest everything.
[14157.40s -> 14165.26s]  Alright, this is, I mean, come on, man.
[14165.26s -> 14166.26s]  This is the final round.
[14166.26s -> 14167.38s]  What the hell happened?
[14167.38s -> 14170.04s]  I'm seriously shook up over this.
[14170.04s -> 14171.04s]  Here comes the heat.
[14171.04s -> 14184.37s]  Who I should have taken that left toy and alpha koi ki?
[14184.37s -> 14186.61s]  I slam dunked off the screen.
[14186.61s -> 14194.83s]  Oops.
[14194.95s -> 14205.66s]  Okay.
[14205.66s -> 14207.54s]  Let's go.
[14218.04s -> 14220.34s]  I'm going as hard as I can.
[14220.34s -> 14221.34s]  I'm going full volume.
[14221.34s -> 14222.77s]  I'm warning you.
[14222.77s -> 14233.28s]  I'm not going to look at chat.
[14233.28s -> 14234.28s]  And it's Steven Universe's theme song.
[14234.28s -> 14235.28s]  It's Steven Universe's map.
[14235.28s -> 14239.84s]  It's the best map in the game.
[14353.38s -> 14383.80s]  We're good.
[14383.80s -> 14384.80s]  Good match.
[14384.80s -> 14385.80s]  Good match.
[14385.80s -> 14386.80s]  Good match.
[14386.80s -> 14392.36s]  That's a good one to go out on.
[14392.36s -> 14393.36s]  Good work.
[14393.36s -> 14395.68s]  Oh yeah.
[14395.68s -> 14397.31s]  No.

[14403.52s -> 14404.52s]  Good battles.
[14404.52s -> 14412.60s]  Alright.
[14412.60s -> 14418.53s]  That was a lot of fun.
[14418.53s -> 14422.53s]  When you get into a rhythm, the game becomes just like fluid, you know, like water.
[14422.53s -> 14426.53s]  It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, down, boom, up, down, down, down, down.
[14429.95s -> 14430.95s]  The game's great.
