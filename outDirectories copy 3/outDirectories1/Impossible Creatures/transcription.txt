[0.00s -> 16.66s]  I don't know. I don't know if I like that. No, there's something wrong here. There's
[16.66s -> 20.58s]  something wrong. It's the elephant. It's not, I know elephant. It's got to be something
[20.58s -> 29.06s]  else. Giraffe. Now that's what I'm talking about. That is the perfect animal. Yeah. Hey,
[29.06s -> 35.79s]  what are you doing over here? Click on him and look at his name. What is that? Look at
[35.79s -> 46.62s]  its name. Do you remember in real life? XD. What is that? Is that a hippopotamus gorilla?
[46.62s -> 54.38s]  Yeah. No. Get out of here. This is a giraffe. Skunk turf. Get the fuck out of here. I don't
[54.38s -> 60.62s]  think you could have hurt him. Can I not kill this? Get out of here. He's too awesome. Come
[60.62s -> 73.55s]  help me long guy. I need help from long guy. What do you mean long guy? Is that a dachshund?
[74.51s -> 81.07s]  Ready boss. You're the boss. No building is up. Somebody's cheating. Building's done. Oh,
[81.07s -> 93.66s]  really? Thanks for the heads up. No. Stop. Just stay here. Just stay here.
[96.38s -> 100.78s]  Can I do anything? Can I do any funny moves? Where are my funny moves?
[100.78s -> 105.58s]  One of these times you're going to spawn there and it's going to kill you.
[108.70s -> 115.65s]  That's not fair. No, it's really not. And what the hell are you two doing?
[115.65s -> 124.46s]  You're supposed to be guarding the perimeter. Kill him. No, kill him. Kill the disappearing
[124.46s -> 132.27s]  shark shithead. He's dead. No, you got him. I did not kill him. He is very much alive.
[132.27s -> 145.22s]  See, I told you he was alive. Okay, nice. How am I supposed to win? I can't. Stop. Let them
[145.22s -> 150.74s]  have a fight. You're not supposed to just let them die. That was all the fight I had.
[151.54s -> 166.67s]  The Quillers are under attack. Come on. What is that thing? What? You don't like,
[168.40s -> 178.40s]  you don't appreciate the meta. What meta? The overlord scouting meta. I don't think I understand
[178.40s -> 186.18s]  this joke. That's a whale bee. What is the overlord? No, he's like a zerg. You send your overlord out
[186.18s -> 193.60s]  to scout first. I didn't play Starcraft. I don't play Starcraft. I have not played Starcraft enough
[193.60s -> 202.18s]  to know what that is. I think everyone who has ever played a video game at the very least knows
[202.18s -> 210.96s]  what a fucking zerg rush is. Yeah. Well, that's not. Here comes my zerglings. I wasn't even ready.
[214.08s -> 224.13s]  Come on. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Your overarching theme. I get it. You're doing a
[224.13s -> 232.51s]  Starcraft thing with your turtle bugs. That's really great. It is really great. Get the fuck
[232.51s -> 236.99s]  out of here. Get this thing and get your overlord and fucking stuff it up your ass.
[236.99s -> 243.73s]  He says he's coming with himself. We have plenty of units. We have the strangest animal
[243.73s -> 251.26s]  the whole time. Those people. I love how my, they're not even attacking. Attack them. Kill them.
[252.00s -> 260.93s]  Kill the people. This is so shit. The Quillers are under attack. The Quillers are under attack.
[260.93s -> 265.81s]  We're not going to win. We're not going to win. Steal their coal. Steal the coal. Get out of here.
[266.53s -> 273.97s]  Get the coal. Come on, snake. Spit it out. Spit it out, snake. No. Start mining. Start mining.
[273.97s -> 277.49s]  Everyone mine it. I would have figured these guys would be dead way longer ago.
[280.69s -> 287.09s]  They are getting eaten by giant crocodile bears. He's getting out with the coal. Where are all the
[287.17s -> 301.28s]  sound effects? We're taking this into the base. We are taking this shit into the base after you
[301.28s -> 309.04s]  kill them, Darren. Go for it, Darren. The fights in this are so anticlimactic. Kill them all, Darren.
[310.24s -> 316.72s]  That's right. Who is Darren? Very good, Darren. Very good job, Darren. You thought you could
[316.72s -> 320.88s]  mess with the Darons. You thought for one second you could fuck with the Darons. I didn't think I
[320.88s -> 327.60s]  could. Come on, Darren. You've got this, Darren. He thinks he can beat us with his beaver praying
[327.60s -> 341.65s]  Manchester. Does he know who you are? You're fucking Darren. No. Darren. For centuries. I don't know
[341.65s -> 349.70s]  how to start this. How do you start this? I don't know. What are we fighting for? I would like to
[349.70s -> 356.62s]  speak with your leader. Yes. The other leader. The other one. We have plenty of leaders.
[357.50s -> 362.94s]  When one goes down, the other will take his place. I need at least one. There's another one right
[362.94s -> 367.42s]  here. There's another leader. Would you like to see a new one? This is also a leader.
[369.46s -> 377.15s]  Yeah, see, one of your guys we caught the other day, he was on our sand and we agreed that was ours.
[377.15s -> 382.59s]  We had a treaty 2,000 years ago, your people and our people, that this bridge shall never be
[382.59s -> 388.11s]  crossed unless for diplomatic reasons. We're crossing it right now. We caught one of your...
[388.91s -> 391.31s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We did not cross the bridge. What are you going to do about it?
[391.31s -> 394.99s]  What are you going to do about it? That is an act of war. That is an act. You back up or that is an act of
[394.99s -> 417.79s]  war. What did you say? Nuclear transform. I don't know.
