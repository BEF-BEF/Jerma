[7.86s -> 11.22s]  Are you even going to give them five seconds to watch the intro?
[11.22s -> 13.75s]  No, I can watch. Do you have an intro?
[13.75s -> 16.47s]  Yeah, I have like little the solar system thing.
[17.56s -> 18.04s]  Oh.
[18.04s -> 19.72s]  Do you not have an intro? Do you stream?
[20.92s -> 22.92s]  I mean, I have a starting soon screen like yours.
[22.92s -> 26.12s]  I thought you meant like an intro, like an actual like animated like intro
[26.12s -> 27.24s]  that some people have like.
[27.24s -> 28.36s]  Oh, no, no.
[28.36s -> 29.32s]  Like a special thing.
[30.12s -> 32.84s]  No, I just mean the starting soon screen.
[34.23s -> 37.59s]  No, I have a fantastic one that would make anyone jealous.
[39.18s -> 40.30s]  You got a pretty good one, don't you?
[40.94s -> 41.98s]  Yeah, I do.
[44.09s -> 45.93s]  I actually I have a streaming question for you.
[48.30s -> 56.73s]  How long in minutes when you hit the go live button on your OBS, you press the button.
[58.58s -> 62.02s]  When do you like when does your stream start?
[62.02s -> 64.50s]  OK, I'm here. I'm talking and now we're going to do the thing.
[64.50s -> 65.54s]  How many minutes go by?
[68.20s -> 69.00s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[69.00s -> 71.88s]  From start of the stream to start of playing the game.
[71.88s -> 75.40s]  Like you press the start streaming until you talking like you're here.
[75.40s -> 76.44s]  Until you talk.
[76.44s -> 77.16s]  Right.
[77.16s -> 81.56s]  OK, I have this really weird issue where I'll turn on my stream
[81.56s -> 85.96s]  and the moment my stream goes on, I remember like three or four things that I wanted to do.
[85.96s -> 86.20s]  Yeah.
[87.00s -> 87.80s]  And then I do them.
[88.36s -> 88.76s]  OK.
[88.76s -> 91.72s]  And they are they are totally unrelated to the stream.
[91.72s -> 93.08s]  Like I can't even remember what it was.
[93.08s -> 96.20s]  One day I turned on my stream and I was like, oh, wait, yeah, I got to go get the hammer.
[96.20s -> 98.44s]  And like, dude, like and I just started like setting up some.
[98.52s -> 99.16s]  I have no.
[99.72s -> 102.84s]  Wait, you were setting up like a DIY project.
[102.84s -> 103.56s]  I don't know.
[103.56s -> 104.44s]  I can't remember.
[104.44s -> 108.52s]  I just know that when the stream goes on, I instantly into my brain is like.
[109.56s -> 110.04s]  Hold on.
[110.92s -> 114.68s]  Now would be a great time to do this thing you had not thought of in a week.
[115.64s -> 117.59s]  It's weird how that happens.
[117.59s -> 119.83s]  Your brain just kind of goes, yeah, do this thing.
[120.55s -> 122.39s]  There's no other opportunity for you to do it.
[123.61s -> 127.29s]  So it depends if I'm doing a DIY project.
[128.73s -> 132.78s]  Or people seem like five minutes Monday.
[132.78s -> 134.06s]  Monday is tomorrow.
[134.06s -> 134.78s]  Hey, what's today?
[135.58s -> 136.78s]  I thought today was Monday.
[136.78s -> 137.42s]  Today's Monday.
[139.26s -> 140.78s]  Oh, bro, today's Sunday.
[142.22s -> 143.66s]  I went to work and everything.
[145.34s -> 148.70s]  I showed I showed up at the office and nobody was going on clocked in.
[148.70s -> 149.74s]  Everyone was looking at me.
[153.19s -> 156.07s]  Yes, we are pretending we're aware we're a little early.
[157.29s -> 160.57s]  I but we meant Monday in Australia.
[162.01s -> 166.09s]  I think that we didn't get that point across Monday in Australia.
[167.24s -> 172.92s]  So sorry, we forgot to add that part to the end of the stream yesterday.
[174.90s -> 176.10s]  Here's the tangent.
[176.10s -> 178.42s]  OK, so you go off on your tangent before we get started.
[179.45s -> 180.97s]  We finished streaming yesterday.
[180.97s -> 181.47s]  Yeah.
[182.41s -> 183.21s]  Yesterday was rough.
[183.85s -> 185.45s]  We were jumping over the lava.
[185.45s -> 186.73s]  There was a millennia.
[186.73s -> 188.81s]  There was a lot of issues yesterday, to be honest.
[188.81s -> 189.31s]  Sure.
[189.93s -> 190.57s]  I think it was full of issues.
[190.57s -> 194.81s]  Barely a minute went by after the stream ended and Strippen messaged me on Discord.
[194.81s -> 196.33s]  He said, yo, great stream, man.
[196.33s -> 197.29s]  It's really refreshing.
[197.29s -> 198.33s]  You watch watching.
[198.33s -> 201.85s]  You suck at ass at a game looking forward to the next one.
[207.38s -> 208.18s]  Soul crushing.
[209.67s -> 211.59s]  So today we got to do better and be better.
[211.59s -> 213.27s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, enjoy it.
[214.15s -> 217.59s]  So your goal today is to make sure that Strippen does not enjoy the stream.
[217.59s -> 221.51s]  I want him to be bored out of his fucking mind watching my stream.
[221.51s -> 223.67s]  I want him to be like, God, he was actually good.
[223.67s -> 224.63s]  He was just holding back.
[225.75s -> 228.04s]  But isn't it?
[228.04s -> 228.36s]  Hold on.
[228.36s -> 229.80s]  But isn't it more fun?
[229.80s -> 231.00s]  We just kind of don't care.
[233.82s -> 234.94s]  Isn't it more fun that way?
[234.94s -> 235.18s]  Do we?
[235.18s -> 236.46s]  We don't have a look.
[236.46s -> 237.74s]  I got really mad last night.
[237.74s -> 238.54s]  That's how you feel.
[239.34s -> 241.26s]  Why did you care so much fighting millennia?
[241.26s -> 244.06s]  Well, because because I hate millennia.
[244.06s -> 246.14s]  OK, I hate millennia.
[247.58s -> 248.86s]  There's a difference.
[248.86s -> 250.46s]  It's the only time during that.
[250.46s -> 252.46s]  OK, how many randomized streams have we done?
[254.38s -> 255.34s]  This would be the fourth one.
[256.14s -> 258.30s]  This would be this would be number four stream number four.
[259.58s -> 260.22s]  I'm sorry.
[260.22s -> 265.98s]  But if I roll up and somebody I don't like is there, I'm I'm going to I don't want to.
[265.98s -> 267.02s]  I don't want to be there.
[267.02s -> 267.82s]  I want to go somewhere else.
[268.54s -> 272.94s]  That's what we should have done.
[274.58s -> 275.62s]  That's what we should have done.
[275.62s -> 279.78s]  But you went into gamer mode when you walk in the door and you say it's millennia.
[279.78s -> 281.78s]  We should have been like, oh, well, we can go anywhere else.
[281.78s -> 285.94s]  But remember, we didn't have the key and the rune.
[285.94s -> 288.82s]  We got really lucky at the last 20 minutes of stream last night
[288.82s -> 290.26s]  because we went somewhere else.
[290.26s -> 291.30s]  We didn't get lucky.
[291.30s -> 294.18s]  We did what we should have done like hours prior.
[294.90s -> 295.62s]  Yeah. But all right.
[295.62s -> 297.54s]  So why did you keep going in the fog door then?
[298.34s -> 300.18s]  I wanted to beat her.
[300.18s -> 300.98s]  Right.
[300.98s -> 303.78s]  Because yeah, it's like, oh, you walked away, dude.
[303.78s -> 304.02s]  Yeah.
[305.06s -> 306.58s]  No, it's a strong force.
[307.38s -> 311.16s]  Do you know how many times I was seriously we were walking in the fog door
[311.16s -> 312.92s]  and I'm like, let's just fuck this.
[312.92s -> 313.80s]  Let's do something else.
[313.80s -> 314.44s]  I mean, I did.
[314.44s -> 315.08s]  And it doesn't matter.
[315.96s -> 316.36s]  Yep.
[316.36s -> 317.96s]  You talked me out of summons.
[317.96s -> 321.56s]  I would rather abandon ship and go do something else than like
[321.56s -> 324.52s]  walk into millennia's room with like a squad of guys.
[325.48s -> 325.96s]  Why?
[327.40s -> 328.68s]  There's just something wrong there.
[330.44s -> 335.08s]  You would rather not beat the thing and then beat the thing.
[337.32s -> 338.04s]  That's so funny.
[338.60s -> 340.84s]  There's a full circle of weird like this is going to.
[341.80s -> 343.72s]  I'm thinking of this explanation is worth it.
[343.72s -> 344.04s]  Okay.
[344.68s -> 345.40s]  Okay.
[345.40s -> 346.52s]  Because I was just talking about it.
[346.52s -> 349.00s]  Actually, there's this show on Netflix that just came out a couple days ago
[349.00s -> 354.12s]  called like Physique 100 or something where it's like all of like the top bodybuilders
[354.12s -> 360.68s]  and like Olympic gold winners in Korea are doing like squid, squid game style,
[360.68s -> 364.44s]  like strength tests to like find the perfect body.
[364.44s -> 365.80s]  Like it's a real competition.
[365.80s -> 366.12s]  What?
[367.59s -> 367.75s]  Yeah.
[367.75s -> 372.15s]  So they got like 100 people all super fit and they're doing like just,
[372.15s -> 375.19s]  you know, like a fitness competition basically, but it's all dubbed.
[375.19s -> 377.11s]  Also, it's hilariously dubbed.
[377.11s -> 379.43s]  I was laughing nonstop.
[379.43s -> 383.43s]  The shit that they say and the voice actors are like so not into it and don't have context.
[384.07s -> 385.75s]  Hilarious the whole way through.
[385.75s -> 386.07s]  Okay.
[386.71s -> 389.59s]  But spoiler alert for the Physique 100.
[389.59s -> 390.31s]  Spoiler alert.
[390.31s -> 390.71s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[390.71s -> 391.51s]  Don't spoil.
[391.51s -> 391.91s]  Okay.
[391.91s -> 394.63s]  Before you do this, should I just like mute you?
[394.63s -> 395.91s]  Because like or leave?
[395.91s -> 396.63s]  Should I take that in my head?
[396.63s -> 398.79s]  Because it sounds like kind of I might want to watch this.
[398.79s -> 400.47s]  So you have to spoil the show.
[400.47s -> 402.23s]  There's only two episodes out so far.
[402.23s -> 403.19s]  It's not all out.
[403.19s -> 403.35s]  All right.
[403.35s -> 404.79s]  So it's not kind of a minor spoiler.
[405.51s -> 408.39s]  I thought you meant like, oh, this is like a 10 episode, 20 episodes.
[408.39s -> 409.19s]  And this is like the last.
[409.75s -> 415.99s]  No, I'm not going to like the people like the first real competition that matters.
[415.99s -> 420.87s]  The winners from like the first thing get to like choose who their opponent is.
[422.55s -> 424.23s]  So they've got 100 people.
[424.23s -> 426.87s]  And then there's like, you know, a bunch of like super fucking buff guys.
[426.87s -> 429.03s]  And then there's also women in the competition.
[429.03s -> 431.59s]  And it's like a wrestling competition basically.
[432.23s -> 433.83s]  And they can just fucking pick women.
[434.71s -> 435.83s]  And it's really fucked up.
[435.83s -> 439.03s]  And my wife is like, why is this allowed?
[439.83s -> 443.83s]  And then there's one guy that's like, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to wrestle that woman.
[444.71s -> 446.55s]  And everyone's like, what the fuck?
[446.55s -> 451.11s]  So what I'm saying is you can choose to walk into Melania's room with a squad of goons.
[451.83s -> 456.63s]  But come on, man, like you really shouldn't be like everyone else.
[456.63s -> 460.23s]  There has like a level of decency where they didn't go there.
[460.23s -> 460.95s]  All right.
[460.95s -> 463.43s]  Well, here they can like fair opponents to look good.
[463.43s -> 466.23s]  Here's but here's the problem with your argument on this.
[467.48s -> 471.69s]  Melania is fucking unstoppable.
[471.69s -> 472.73s]  I beat her in my run.
[473.77s -> 480.90s]  But the point to your point is Melania will wipe the floor with a hundred of us.
[483.80s -> 484.52s]  That's not true.
[486.04s -> 486.36s]  Is it?
[488.12s -> 493.35s]  You're gonna play guilty gear right now.
[494.76s -> 495.40s]  Oh, yes.
[495.40s -> 496.92s]  Let's do guilty gear.
[499.61s -> 502.41s]  Dude, it could be that could be it could be doesn't matter.
[502.41s -> 503.69s]  It could be like a bug.
[504.63s -> 508.07s]  It could be a single insect, a single ant in that room.
[508.63s -> 516.87s]  If it is an insanely difficult, strong enemy, what do you think we're going to get our ass kicked?
[516.87s -> 518.07s]  Regardless doesn't matter.
[519.34s -> 521.26s]  But then you're going to look twice as bad.
[521.26s -> 526.55s]  If the single ant has the waterfowl move, which doesn't matter.
[527.27s -> 529.35s]  We we were we were dodging it.
[531.19s -> 532.79s]  You know, we were we were getting there.
[534.66s -> 536.34s]  Real life isn't video games.
[539.58s -> 540.14s]  A single.
[541.74s -> 543.74s]  Why are summons in the game in all caps?
[545.38s -> 546.26s]  I understand.
[546.26s -> 547.22s]  I understand your point.
[547.86s -> 550.90s]  But when you play Elden Ring, it's not in front of an audience that like,
[552.84s -> 555.00s]  you know, it's a different scenario.
[556.01s -> 558.57s]  Like, yeah, would I wrestle with a girl in the mud?
[559.64s -> 560.04s]  Sure.
[560.04s -> 564.34s]  But on TV, when I can choose muscular men.
[565.38s -> 567.46s]  What the fuck is he talking about?
[567.46s -> 569.22s]  What is he talking about?
[569.22s -> 570.90s]  What what what is he going on?
[570.90s -> 571.62s]  What is what is he?
[571.62s -> 572.34s]  What is happening?
[572.34s -> 572.50s]  Right.
[572.50s -> 573.62s]  What is he saying?
[573.62s -> 574.90s]  You have to see the show.
[574.90s -> 576.26s]  OK, what is he saying?
[577.14s -> 583.75s]  So this is this is like directly tied to this show on Netflix.
[583.75s -> 584.39s]  Yeah.
[584.39s -> 587.24s]  OK, so we saying is I have to see this show.
[589.54s -> 590.18s]  Well, yeah.
[590.18s -> 593.06s]  And then you would agree that you shouldn't mud wrestle with women.
[594.30s -> 595.34s]  Only muscular men.
[596.70s -> 598.86s]  I I don't even know what the context of what you're.
[599.34s -> 601.10s]  I need to see the show at some point.
[601.10s -> 601.34s]  Yeah.
[603.11s -> 603.43s]  All right.
[603.43s -> 606.15s]  Are you ready to fucking smoke a blunt with Placidusix or what?
[607.72s -> 608.84s]  I don't have that mod.
[613.75s -> 614.87s]  You said you'd be back Monday.
[614.87s -> 615.91s]  You're liars.
[615.91s -> 623.19s]  Well, look, I I was asleep last night and I woke up in the middle of the night
[623.19s -> 628.60s]  and I had just like I had like laser eyes like I was like, we got to beat it.
[629.72s -> 630.76s]  I can't wait.
[630.76s -> 633.80s]  I just was like, hey, sir, you're not doing side content.
[633.80s -> 636.74s]  We're going or what are we doing?
[636.74s -> 638.34s]  No, we're just doing what we want.
[638.98s -> 639.70s]  OK, OK.
[639.70s -> 642.26s]  I thought the laser eyes meant like we have to continue
[642.26s -> 645.14s]  fucking smash smashing our head against millennia.
[645.14s -> 646.10s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[646.10s -> 646.98s]  I never want to go.
[646.98s -> 650.18s]  If there's a bazooka mod and we can install it and we can just shoot a bazooka at her
[650.18s -> 651.94s]  and it's like 5000 damage, we'll do that.
[652.74s -> 655.06s]  OK, I'm sure someone has made that.
[656.23s -> 656.95s]  All right. You good?
[658.36s -> 659.40s]  Are we good to get started?
[659.40s -> 660.04s]  Are you in the game?
[660.04s -> 661.56s]  Yeah, I'm loading up the game.
[661.56s -> 662.68s]  I'm loading up the game.
[662.68s -> 663.56s]  I'm continuing.
[663.56s -> 665.00s]  I'm loading up the game.
[665.00s -> 666.12s]  You already made that joke.
[666.12s -> 667.72s]  I made that joke in free stream.
[667.72s -> 670.84s]  I'm sorry, but it was like it was like not a joke.
[670.84s -> 672.52s]  There were like 15 people that were there.
[674.73s -> 675.61s]  He's not joking.
[676.17s -> 679.53s]  Guys, I use pre stream is kind of like, oh, was this funny?
[679.53s -> 680.57s]  Because they go, ha ha ha.
[680.57s -> 681.37s]  And then I'm like, I got it.
[681.37s -> 682.33s]  I'm going to use that on the stream.
[683.05s -> 687.38s]  How lame would that be if you went to like a stand up comics like show
[688.54s -> 691.10s]  and they're doing a show before people get in the room
[692.57s -> 696.41s]  and then they just do the show again that that's called rehearsal.
[696.97s -> 699.77s]  Yeah, that's dress rehearsal.
[699.77s -> 703.45s]  Okay, they do that on like every major television show.
[703.45s -> 706.89s]  How lame would it be if like you pay all you go to New York City
[706.89s -> 711.37s]  and they're like doing a like theater and they're doing they've like rehearsed for it.
[711.93s -> 715.42s]  Can't they just like can't they just come out and do it?
[715.42s -> 718.70s]  Hey, I've never been to a taping of SNL,
[718.70s -> 723.66s]  but I'm pretty sure that they do dress rehearsal on SNL before they go live.
[724.62s -> 727.18s]  So they actually I think they do that on SNL.
[728.31s -> 729.19s]  So it's all fake.
[729.83s -> 730.23s]  Sorry.
[731.21s -> 734.26s]  No, this is it's all fake.
[734.26s -> 735.54s]  But SNL sucks.
[735.54s -> 736.90s]  I didn't say I watched it.
[741.53s -> 742.49s]  You got your thing done?
[745.85s -> 748.39s]  Yeah, hold on.
[748.39s -> 750.31s]  My controller not working.
[750.31s -> 752.15s]  My controller not working.
[752.15s -> 752.79s]  What the heck?
[755.38s -> 756.42s]  Oh, you might say sorry.
[757.22s -> 759.46s]  My left bumper is not doing anything.
[761.67s -> 763.11s]  I can't I can't block.
[764.76s -> 767.64s]  Plug it in, plug it in, plug it in, unplug it in.
[767.64s -> 769.00s]  I'm plugging, unplugging.
[772.97s -> 773.85s]  Yeah, okay.
[773.85s -> 779.94s]  I just looked at this and at some point in our rage yesterday,
[779.94s -> 782.18s]  I changed weapons to the pizza cutter.
[782.18s -> 785.38s]  I'm like, where is my fire sword?
[785.38s -> 786.74s]  Where did that go?
[786.74s -> 789.98s]  I'm looking at this going, why do I have this equipped?
[789.98s -> 791.99s]  And I'm like, wait, that's right.
[791.99s -> 795.11s]  I've rage respect to fight millennia.
[795.11s -> 798.55s]  This thing's still fine.
[798.55s -> 800.78s]  Did you break it?
[800.78s -> 801.66s]  I don't know.
[801.66s -> 803.10s]  It's only one button, dude.
[812.01s -> 815.43s]  SNL is funny.
[815.43s -> 817.67s]  You and Chad are not as funny and jealous crying.
[819.35s -> 828.81s]  I haven't watched an episode of SNL in at least five to ten years.
[829.45s -> 830.98s]  I've never watched one.
[831.62s -> 834.15s]  You know, I think it's really funny though,
[834.15s -> 840.04s]  is that like news websites will report on what happened on SNL.
[840.04s -> 840.60s]  Like it's new.
[840.60s -> 840.92s]  Really?
[841.56s -> 845.16s]  Yeah, like SNL's take on like this political situation.
[845.16s -> 846.28s]  Did you see it last night?
[846.28s -> 848.36s]  It's like, fuck you.
[851.08s -> 852.12s]  Do some journalism.
[853.91s -> 855.11s]  Fuck you.
[855.11s -> 865.00s]  That's, that's, you know, that's so funny because it's like,
[865.64s -> 870.71s]  I feel like like reporting on something that was already reported,
[870.71s -> 873.83s]  that was reported through like a satire kind of website or something.
[873.83s -> 875.11s]  That kind of happens too, doesn't it?
[877.43s -> 880.38s]  It's like, don't people eat the onion all the time?
[880.38s -> 882.30s]  Oh yeah, they do eat the onion.
[882.30s -> 889.13s]  People do news reports on tweets.
[891.30s -> 896.31s]  Yeah, I remember the first time I did see like,
[896.31s -> 900.23s]  they used the tweet and they were talking about it on like a news piece.
[900.23s -> 902.87s]  And I was like, what the hell is going on?
[904.55s -> 906.79s]  Nothing that happens on Twitter is real.
[906.79s -> 912.46s]  It's all made up.
[913.02s -> 914.31s]  Are you joining?
[914.31s -> 914.95s]  I didn't know.
[914.95s -> 917.27s]  I thought you said you were, I thought you're having controller problems.
[917.27s -> 918.79s]  No, I mean, I'm in the game.
[918.79s -> 919.51s]  I can live with it.
[919.51s -> 920.47s]  It's just the block button.
[920.47s -> 924.49s]  You're not allowed to even actually like block anything in this game.
[924.49s -> 928.41s]  I mean, millennia would destroy me because I did surgery on a grape, bro.
[928.41s -> 928.97s]  What?
[928.97s -> 935.19s]  I'm going to look in my closet for my bonus controller.
[935.19s -> 935.91s]  Where did I end?
[935.91s -> 936.71s]  Oh, there you are.
[938.79s -> 940.95s]  All right, so let's give a recap.
[940.95s -> 944.66s]  We just got a huge raid from RT.
[944.66s -> 946.26s]  RT Game, what's up?
[946.26s -> 948.04s]  What's going on, RT?
[948.04s -> 949.99s]  Hope everything's going well.
[949.99s -> 951.43s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[951.43s -> 952.23s]  RT is awesome.
[952.23s -> 953.67s]  You don't follow RT.
[953.67s -> 955.32s]  What are you dumb?
[955.32s -> 961.27s]  What was RT doing?
[961.27s -> 962.47s]  What were you doing, RT?
[962.47s -> 969.62s]  Persona?
[969.62s -> 971.58s]  Persona 5.
[971.58s -> 974.39s]  Cool.
[974.39s -> 976.55s]  Join us in following RT Game.
[976.55s -> 977.51s]  Wait, what?
[977.51s -> 978.63s]  This is like a new feature.
[978.63s -> 980.15s]  You could, wait, what is that?
[980.15s -> 983.24s]  This is a new feature where you could like,
[983.80s -> 984.60s]  that's kind of cool.
[984.60s -> 985.72s]  I didn't know you could do that.
[985.72s -> 986.94s]  It's cool.
[986.94s -> 988.86s]  Whoa, that's actually really cool.
[988.86s -> 995.98s]  Sir, do you like the Persona games?
[995.98s -> 999.29s]  I feel like you might be one of those Persona fans.
[1000.79s -> 1009.64s]  You just call me a fucking weeb?
[1009.64s -> 1014.28s]  No, it's supposed to have to be very compelling characters
[1014.28s -> 1016.28s]  and gameplay and story.
[1016.28s -> 1022.23s]  And it's one of the most celebrated RPG franchises in history.
[1022.23s -> 1023.83s]  I can't say that I've played any game
[1023.83s -> 1026.15s]  that takes you like 400 hours to beat.
[1026.15s -> 1032.94s]  And you could have just said no.
[1037.05s -> 1038.49s]  Jermis getting defensive.
[1038.49s -> 1039.37s]  Uh-oh.
[1039.37s -> 1041.13s]  I just wanted to alienate probably like,
[1041.13s -> 1042.89s]  you know, like 50% of the people listening.
[1042.89s -> 1044.49s]  I have to, let me be really honest, though.
[1044.49s -> 1047.05s]  I have to, let's put all the cards on this table.
[1047.85s -> 1051.61s]  I have opened every Persona game that's come to Game Pass.
[1052.95s -> 1053.99s]  Game Pass again.
[1053.99s -> 1058.39s]  And after like 30 or 40 minutes, I just kind of close it.
[1060.46s -> 1061.42s]  Every single one of them.
[1063.22s -> 1064.26s]  It's not that I don't like it.
[1064.26s -> 1064.74s]  I'm just like...
[1066.34s -> 1067.54s]  Yeah, I don't like it.
[1068.10s -> 1068.90s]  I can say that.
[1069.62s -> 1072.34s]  I'm not on contract with the Persona devs.
[1072.34s -> 1073.70s]  I played the fighting game,
[1074.50s -> 1076.42s]  Persona 4 Arena, I like that game.
[1076.50s -> 1076.82s]  All right.
[1078.71s -> 1080.95s]  So here's what's happening.
[1080.95s -> 1082.55s]  It's been 15 minutes.
[1082.55s -> 1084.23s]  We had our relaxing session.
[1084.23s -> 1086.07s]  Oh, so you have a limit of 15.
[1086.07s -> 1087.27s]  That's why you asked earlier.
[1087.27s -> 1088.79s]  So you could set a limit.
[1090.86s -> 1094.06s]  Um, what?
[1094.06s -> 1095.42s]  No more, no more talking.
[1095.42s -> 1095.82s]  All right.
[1095.82s -> 1097.98s]  Listen to me very carefully.
[1097.98s -> 1099.42s]  You like literally just brought,
[1099.42s -> 1100.54s]  you brought up the topic.
[1100.54s -> 1103.42s]  Do you like Arena, like a Persona 4?
[1103.42s -> 1104.38s]  And then I got...
[1105.10s -> 1106.62s]  You got very angry.
[1106.62s -> 1109.82s]  We didn't get, we didn't even get to talk about it really in depth.
[1109.82s -> 1111.58s]  And then you cut it off and you're like, fine.
[1111.58s -> 1112.38s]  He didn't like it.
[1112.38s -> 1115.26s]  So like, we're not talking, we're not talking.
[1115.26s -> 1118.94s]  Oh, dude, you can't convince me to like Persona.
[1118.94s -> 1120.70s]  That was, that was that scenario.
[1120.70s -> 1123.42s]  Dude, bro, you're not going to be able to convince me to like Persona.
[1123.42s -> 1124.70s]  I said, hey, do you like the Persona?
[1124.70s -> 1125.66s]  I don't like JRPGs, man.
[1125.66s -> 1126.78s]  Like, Final Fantasy?
[1126.78s -> 1127.74s]  I, I can't.
[1129.10s -> 1132.38s]  Yeah, but so, I'm going to keep the conversation going.
[1132.38s -> 1133.66s]  Here, new conversation.
[1133.66s -> 1136.30s]  If you had to pick any genre of game that you would just be like,
[1136.30s -> 1137.98s]  incapable of enjoying.
[1137.98s -> 1138.62s]  Yeah.
[1138.62s -> 1139.42s]  What is it for you?
[1139.42s -> 1140.30s]  Strategy games.
[1144.06s -> 1147.66s]  Like, like, stuff like Crusader Kings.
[1148.46s -> 1149.26s]  Oh, gosh.
[1149.26s -> 1149.74s]  I just couldn't.
[1149.74s -> 1150.38s]  Oh, my goodness.
[1150.38s -> 1151.02s]  I couldn't play it.
[1151.82s -> 1158.15s]  I feel like I used to be like that, even with like StarCraft.
[1159.34s -> 1161.10s]  Well, RTS is different, I think.
[1161.10s -> 1163.59s]  But like, I mean, like true, like strategy games.
[1163.59s -> 1165.11s]  I just, there's just too much for me.
[1165.11s -> 1166.47s]  I just, they don't bore me.
[1166.47s -> 1167.35s]  They just overwhelm me.
[1168.84s -> 1169.16s]  Okay.
[1169.16s -> 1171.88s]  So we have the Manor key and we have two runes.
[1172.60s -> 1173.88s]  All right, let's go to the Manor.
[1173.88s -> 1174.68s]  You want, we can actually...
[1175.64s -> 1177.16s]  We can actually go into the room now.
[1177.80s -> 1178.68s]  Yeah, let's go to the room.
[1179.32s -> 1187.72s]  What's your favorite JRPG?
[1187.72s -> 1189.40s]  Uh, Chrono Trigger.
[1189.40s -> 1193.48s]  Did you play Chrono Trigger?
[1193.48s -> 1194.04s]  Nope.
[1194.04s -> 1194.60s]  You should.
[1194.60s -> 1195.16s]  You really should.
[1195.16s -> 1195.72s]  Everybody should.
[1196.28s -> 1197.00s]  Everyone.
[1197.00s -> 1202.74s]  That should be required rating to own a console or like a PC.
[1202.74s -> 1204.10s]  You should have to do your homework.
[1204.10s -> 1207.45s]  You should have to prove that you played it before you get like a console.
[1207.45s -> 1210.25s]  It should literally, when you turn, you know, when you turn on your Xbox,
[1210.25s -> 1211.85s]  it's like, welcome to Xbox.
[1211.85s -> 1212.33s]  Set it up.
[1212.33s -> 1213.21s]  What's your name?
[1213.21s -> 1214.33s]  And what's your date of birth?
[1214.33s -> 1219.29s]  Before that, it should, the Chrono Trigger splash screen intro should lie.
[1219.29s -> 1220.18s]  No, no, no.
[1220.18s -> 1221.54s]  Like it's just baked into every console.
[1221.54s -> 1223.70s]  Like you have, it's like, here it is.
[1223.70s -> 1229.13s]  Like Chrono Trigger, the and you have to play through the whole game
[1229.13s -> 1230.49s]  before you can even make your account on Xbox.
[1232.82s -> 1234.10s]  Even if you've already played it before.
[1236.10s -> 1237.22s]  How would you prove that?
[1237.86s -> 1239.14s]  I don't know.
[1239.14s -> 1241.14s]  It could like ask you a trivia question.
[1241.14s -> 1241.70s]  Oh yeah.
[1241.70s -> 1243.06s]  But no, you could, you could look it up though.
[1246.54s -> 1250.22s]  I mean, somebody said, why are you gatekeeping an entire generation?
[1252.46s -> 1255.42s]  We just dropped the new halo and we're so excited for you to try it.
[1255.42s -> 1257.58s]  Make sure you guys finish Chrono Trigger soon.
[1257.58s -> 1257.82s]  Yeah.
[1257.82s -> 1259.02s]  Want to be trying it.
[1259.02s -> 1259.26s]  Yeah.
[1259.26s -> 1261.90s]  The new Xbox just dropped, but make sure you get,
[1261.90s -> 1263.42s]  make sure you start playing Chrono Trigger.
[1263.42s -> 1266.57s]  It's going to take you at least 20 to 40 hours.
[1266.57s -> 1267.93s]  Now this is no, what is here?
[1267.93s -> 1268.81s]  There's nothing here.
[1268.81s -> 1270.25s]  Are we still fucked?
[1270.25s -> 1274.41s]  Don't we need an invitation or something?
[1274.41s -> 1275.05s]  No, no, no, no.
[1275.05s -> 1276.25s]  There's a, there's a secret.
[1276.25s -> 1276.73s]  Oh, okay.
[1276.73s -> 1277.13s]  The secret.
[1277.13s -> 1277.37s]  Yep.
[1278.09s -> 1279.54s]  See the door in the back.
[1279.54s -> 1281.38s]  I just got the Elden Lord helmet.
[1282.18s -> 1284.36s]  What is this?
[1284.36s -> 1285.08s]  Wait, is there anything?
[1287.50s -> 1288.22s]  I don't, I don't remember.
[1288.22s -> 1289.62s]  Hold on.
[1289.62s -> 1290.34s]  No, I know where it is.
[1290.34s -> 1293.34s]  Is there, this is where everybody hangs out,
[1293.34s -> 1295.02s]  where you do the, uh, the missions and stuff.
[1295.02s -> 1303.06s]  It's like here.
[1303.06s -> 1306.25s]  Right now.
[1306.25s -> 1308.10s]  Guys, which room is it?
[1308.10s -> 1310.02s]  It's the room with the, with the girl.
[1310.66s -> 1313.45s]  This one here.
[1314.01s -> 1315.14s]  Oh, their room.
[1315.88s -> 1316.84s]  Oh, their room.
[1316.84s -> 1317.64s]  Wrong room.
[1317.64s -> 1318.68s]  I just want to open both of these.
[1319.24s -> 1319.80s]  Oh, their room.
[1324.09s -> 1327.21s]  You know what the, the, the thing about Millennia is?
[1327.21s -> 1329.53s]  Cause I was, I was remembering last night.
[1329.53s -> 1329.77s]  Yeah.
[1330.49s -> 1334.97s]  That millennia is in like the secret area
[1334.97s -> 1337.91s]  of like the frost world.
[1337.91s -> 1338.07s]  Right.
[1338.07s -> 1339.03s]  That's hard to get to.
[1339.59s -> 1341.91s]  And then she's in the secret or secret Hallig tree
[1341.91s -> 1343.11s]  that I don't even remember how you like,
[1343.11s -> 1344.87s]  doesn't she have to do some weird shit to get there?
[1345.59s -> 1345.75s]  Yeah.
[1345.75s -> 1348.31s]  I mean, it's a, it's a, it's an optional secret area.
[1348.31s -> 1348.63s]  It is.
[1348.63s -> 1348.87s]  Yeah.
[1348.87s -> 1350.39s]  And then her whole area sucks.
[1350.39s -> 1351.91s]  And then you get down there and then it's like, okay.
[1351.91s -> 1353.91s]  Mal, like she deserves to suck.
[1353.91s -> 1356.79s]  I, I did not hate the Hallig tree area.
[1356.79s -> 1358.63s]  You didn't like, you, you like really didn't like the area.
[1359.91s -> 1360.79s]  I didn't, I didn't hate it.
[1361.51s -> 1362.70s]  I would watch out though.
[1363.26s -> 1364.22s]  I skipped the whole area.
[1365.18s -> 1366.87s]  You mean like, like you skipped it as
[1366.87s -> 1369.19s]  and you've never played it or you like jumped off
[1369.19s -> 1371.83s]  like a ledge and landed like all the way at the bottom or something.
[1371.83s -> 1372.63s]  I did that.
[1372.63s -> 1372.87s]  Okay.
[1372.87s -> 1374.47s]  There was the elevator skip.
[1374.47s -> 1375.83s]  So I didn't play most of it.
[1375.83s -> 1377.19s]  And then I went back and I was like, you know,
[1377.19s -> 1378.31s]  I'm curious what's in the Hallig tree.
[1378.31s -> 1379.59s]  Like I want to play it like for real.
[1379.59s -> 1381.75s]  And I fucking hated it.
[1383.19s -> 1384.10s]  I'm sorry.
[1384.10s -> 1385.22s]  I can't hear anything you're saying.
[1386.90s -> 1390.76s]  We're just cutting the weeds down.
[1391.93s -> 1392.97s]  Ah, this is a big job.
[1392.97s -> 1394.65s]  This is going to cost a little extra.
[1394.73s -> 1399.45s]  I, uh, I can't, uh, I can't, I can't cast magic
[1404.41s -> 1406.41s]  because I can't press my bumper.
[1406.41s -> 1412.44s]  What did you do to your controller?
[1412.44s -> 1413.56s]  Give me, it's just one button.
[1413.56s -> 1414.04s]  Give me a second.
[1414.04s -> 1417.75s]  I have like an old Xbox 360 controller.
[1417.75s -> 1422.76s]  I got to plug it in old Xbox 360 and not an Xbox one controller.
[1425.69s -> 1427.45s]  Oh, no, it has.
[1427.45s -> 1429.29s]  Well, I was on an Xbox one controller.
[1429.93s -> 1432.33s]  This thing has the fucking the weird cable in the middle
[1434.31s -> 1436.87s]  that isn't a USB, but it connects to the cable that I've.
[1437.67s -> 1439.35s]  I mean, like you go ahead.
[1439.35s -> 1440.47s]  I'm dying to poison.
[1441.03s -> 1442.55s]  I, I know where I'm going.
[1442.55s -> 1443.03s]  I'm clear.
[1443.03s -> 1443.83s]  Okay, don't worry.
[1445.03s -> 1446.46s]  It's all good.
[1446.46s -> 1446.78s]  Don't worry.
[1446.78s -> 1447.18s]  We're good.
[1447.74s -> 1452.86s]  How's everybody doing tonight?
[1452.86s -> 1453.36s]  Good.
[1453.82s -> 1455.62s]  Everybody doing okay?
[1456.26s -> 1459.32s]  How you been?
[1459.32s -> 1460.81s]  You're okay?
[1461.37s -> 1467.93s]  Hope you're doing all right.
[1472.58s -> 1497.91s]  Stirr, there's blood on the ground.
[1497.91s -> 1503.32s]  So you mentioned before that you don't like JRPGs.
[1507.02s -> 1509.26s]  Is there a particular reason as to why?
[1509.26s -> 1510.14s]  Is it too slow?
[1510.14s -> 1511.74s]  Is it like Stirr wants to go fast?
[1511.74s -> 1513.02s]  I'm like walking around my room.
[1513.02s -> 1513.90s]  Are you talking to me?
[1513.90s -> 1514.38s]  Oh, sorry.
[1514.38s -> 1514.86s]  No, no, no.
[1514.86s -> 1515.34s]  Keep doing that.
[1515.34s -> 1516.46s]  Keep like wireless.
[1516.46s -> 1518.14s]  I don't think I have another controller.
[1518.14s -> 1519.26s]  I'm going to die.
[1519.26s -> 1521.48s]  Well, I really ruined that.
[1521.48s -> 1522.04s]  Sorry, chat.
[1523.51s -> 1525.19s]  I got his attention and he came back over.
[1525.75s -> 1529.78s]  We were trying to we were trying to see if you were going to die.
[1529.78s -> 1531.30s]  No, I was just trying to keep you talking.
[1531.30s -> 1534.90s]  I figured we would keep you distracted and you just lead the poison river.
[1535.46s -> 1537.86s]  You found out that you were walking around your room.
[1540.06s -> 1542.76s]  Yeah, so you don't have another controller.
[1544.58s -> 1548.18s]  No, I would need the extra part of the cable for the other one.
[1548.98s -> 1554.86s]  Is it a case of is it like jammed up or something?
[1555.66s -> 1556.22s]  I don't know.
[1556.22s -> 1558.30s]  I'm using it as hard as I can.
[1559.50s -> 1560.46s]  I'm doing tapping.
[1561.42s -> 1563.90s]  It's just my left bumper bumper.
[1564.95s -> 1566.47s]  You could block button.
[1566.47s -> 1575.11s]  Theoretically, you could make left trigger cast and you could do like left stick.
[1576.07s -> 1577.75s]  Could be walk.
[1577.75s -> 1579.90s]  Does that sound stupid?
[1580.54s -> 1583.27s]  Because there's literally there's not a single reason to crouch in this game.
[1584.07s -> 1585.99s]  There's not one single reason to crouch.
[1587.03s -> 1589.43s]  You can just rebind in this game, right?
[1589.43s -> 1590.63s]  Yeah, like individual buttons.
[1595.61s -> 1599.45s]  And if you're going to get rid of crouch versus be able to use your shield,
[1599.45s -> 1601.93s]  I think that's the best place to put it.
[1602.65s -> 1604.18s]  What about crouch attack?
[1608.25s -> 1609.21s]  For some weapons, yeah.
[1609.85s -> 1613.51s]  Anything else?
[1619.29s -> 1628.42s]  Okay, that was like a that was like a GTA four video we made and like somebody just
[1628.42s -> 1629.78s]  got hit by the car.
[1629.78s -> 1632.10s]  Okay, so I went to go rebind my controls.
[1632.66s -> 1637.62s]  So I rebound like you said to the stick and then I went back up to crouch and it's like,
[1637.62s -> 1638.74s]  oh, you have to like change this.
[1638.74s -> 1639.22s]  It's red.
[1639.22s -> 1643.42s]  So I press left bumper to change it and it worked.
[1643.42s -> 1643.90s]  There you go.
[1645.85s -> 1647.53s]  Why isn't it working in the game?
[1647.53s -> 1650.57s]  Wait, it doesn't work.
[1650.57s -> 1651.53s]  It only works on the menu.
[1653.82s -> 1656.30s]  Yeah, it will not work in the game.
[1656.30s -> 1657.66s]  I think I should like restart my game.
[1658.46s -> 1661.42s]  All right, let's let's just like get to a bonfire and then I'm going to restart.
[1661.42s -> 1663.50s]  That's that's very weird.
[1663.50s -> 1664.14s]  Yeah, that's weird.
[1664.78s -> 1671.66s]  All right, this doesn't open.
[1673.77s -> 1681.02s]  So what I forget what you end up you go like deeper, don't you or something?
[1681.02s -> 1683.02s]  There's like a secret wall somewhere again.
[1688.31s -> 1689.19s]  This was another area.
[1689.19s -> 1691.03s]  That's like, why would they like hide?
[1691.03s -> 1692.47s]  Change wand hands.
[1692.47s -> 1694.07s]  Someone's saying, hey, change wand hands.
[1695.03s -> 1696.15s]  I have a shield in my hand.
[1697.27s -> 1700.87s]  I just switched weapons and it just started like I already had the button down.
[1701.11s -> 1705.91s]  I was well, that person should be should be commended for that.
[1706.63s -> 1712.57s]  Because I'm going to reinstall Windows.
[1712.57s -> 1714.33s]  Just we need to find like a grace to rest up.
[1716.89s -> 1717.53s]  Oh, it's over here.
[1718.92s -> 1719.24s]  Yeah.
[1719.24s -> 1719.48s]  Yeah.
[1719.48s -> 1722.12s]  All right, guys, I got to reinstall Windows.
[1722.12s -> 1729.67s]  The forums were saying this doesn't happen on Linux because like a Gabe Newell alt account.
[1736.06s -> 1746.15s]  Dude, what is that thing?
[1746.15s -> 1748.26s]  Chat chat.
[1748.26s -> 1750.42s]  What is that chat?
[1750.90s -> 1751.62s]  Chat, what is that?
[1752.34s -> 1753.86s]  Oh, it's just one of those silent things.
[1764.73s -> 1765.37s]  There we go.
[1766.17s -> 1769.29s]  Banishing you because I don't think it lets me quit the game until I banish you.
[1769.93s -> 1770.33s]  Go ahead.
[1770.33s -> 1772.25s]  I restarting and I'm holding up.
[1772.25s -> 1775.21s]  I'm holding everything up and it's all my fault that we're late again.
[1778.41s -> 1779.61s]  No, that's not true.
[1779.61s -> 1779.85s]  Yeah.
[1779.85s -> 1780.49s]  In the menu.
[1780.49s -> 1782.41s]  I could if we're totally fine.
[1782.41s -> 1784.01s]  Oh, just just reset the whole client.
[1784.73s -> 1796.30s]  I'm just going to go right back there.
[1797.02s -> 1805.21s]  I forget where that is here.
[1806.02s -> 1806.34s]  Stir.
[1806.34s -> 1807.14s]  You have a great room.
[1807.14s -> 1808.18s]  Go to Landale.
[1808.18s -> 1810.10s]  We're going to kill fucking right card.
[1810.10s -> 1811.06s]  Yeah, we're going to kill right card.
[1811.70s -> 1812.89s]  Do you like radishes?
[1813.93s -> 1817.46s]  Um, I can't remember.
[1817.46s -> 1821.46s]  I feel like I've had pickled radishes as like part of some Korean meal.
[1821.46s -> 1821.86s]  No.
[1821.86s -> 1822.82s]  And I'm like, okay.
[1823.38s -> 1825.43s]  Uh, I actually prefer them.
[1825.43s -> 1832.66s]  Just just I don't know if I like washed just are you like is this like a Doug funny moment?
[1832.66s -> 1833.54s]  We're going back to that again.
[1833.54s -> 1835.46s]  Like you just eat beats like raw.
[1835.46s -> 1837.46s]  You just like grab a beat and take a chomp out.
[1837.46s -> 1838.90s]  I wish I liked beats.
[1838.90s -> 1841.62s]  I wish I liked to eat beats like that.
[1841.70s -> 1848.94s]  They're they're unbelievably that is like the most powerful super food in existence is a beat.
[1848.94s -> 1850.70s]  But I think they disgusting.
[1850.70s -> 1859.08s]  I think they just taste like dirt.
[1859.08s -> 1865.16s]  Yeah, I I have no mental association with what a radish tastes like.
[1865.16s -> 1868.04s]  Uh, they're kind of they're super crunchy.
[1868.04s -> 1870.52s]  And when you bite into them, you get that kind of nasal heat.
[1870.52s -> 1871.32s]  They're kind of spicy.
[1871.32s -> 1875.72s]  Like you get that up here like in the top of your nose.
[1875.72s -> 1881.85s]  I've opened my world.
[1881.85s -> 1882.57s]  I can't relate.
[1885.75s -> 1886.95s]  You don't want to eat a shitload of them.
[1887.51s -> 1889.29s]  Like wasabi.
[1891.13s -> 1892.97s]  It's a little less harsh than wasabi.
[1892.97s -> 1894.49s]  I would say a lot less harsh than wasabi.
[1895.69s -> 1897.13s]  My intestinal parasites.
[1898.09s -> 1898.65s]  I'm good.
[1898.65s -> 1902.36s]  I I stared death in the eye and I won.
[1902.36s -> 1905.64s]  You know, it's really annoying about that conversation yesterday and about how
[1905.64s -> 1908.30s]  that whole thing played out.
[1908.30s -> 1913.24s]  I had diarrhea this morning and it was just like my dog.
[1913.24s -> 1915.80s]  I was just sitting there going fuck that guy.
[1917.08s -> 1917.96s]  What the fuck?
[1918.76s -> 1919.96s]  It's not fair.
[1919.96s -> 1920.60s]  That's what I'm saying.
[1920.60s -> 1921.80s]  I got away with it.
[1922.38s -> 1925.26s]  I was sitting there just being like, you got to be kidding me.
[1925.26s -> 1929.82s]  This guy eats raw pork that's been in a backpack for a day and like, oh,
[1929.82s -> 1931.66s]  my tummy is upset this morning.
[1932.46s -> 1933.90s]  I was like, what the fuck, man?
[1935.61s -> 1937.13s]  Oh, yeah, that's the millennia shortcut.
[1940.62s -> 1941.10s]  There it is.
[1941.66s -> 1941.98s]  Yeah.
[1941.98s -> 1944.78s]  Now the door people were telling us to open for like hours yesterday,
[1944.78s -> 1945.74s]  but we didn't have the key to do it.
[1945.74s -> 1946.62s]  We didn't have the key to do it.
[1946.62s -> 1950.42s]  But now we need to how do we get to right?
[1950.42s -> 1953.54s]  We have to do the invitation shit to do right card, don't we?
[1954.26s -> 1954.74s]  Here.
[1954.74s -> 1957.21s]  There's one way.
[1957.21s -> 1958.49s]  If you're an actual god.
[1958.49s -> 1961.78s]  No, you can get teleported down there.
[1961.78s -> 1962.50s]  This jump.
[1962.50s -> 1964.50s]  There's a teleporter that takes you down there.
[1964.50s -> 1982.28s]  For one second, for one second, I thought your connection dropped
[1982.28s -> 1988.20s]  and that was the last sound you made before you got kicked from the discord.
[1988.20s -> 1990.52s]  I thought you were like, ah, like, what the fuck?
[1990.52s -> 1993.24s]  Like you were like, ah, and it was like, ah, it froze.
[1993.24s -> 1996.04s]  I thought you froze and you were just got booted and you've lagged out.
[1996.04s -> 1997.24s]  No, I.
[2000.04s -> 2000.84s]  What's the jump?
[2000.84s -> 2001.48s]  How do you do it?
[2002.04s -> 2003.64s]  You have to get up on top of this thing.
[2003.64s -> 2005.72s]  And then you see where that like that ledge up there,
[2006.36s -> 2007.16s]  they patch this.
[2007.16s -> 2011.72s]  So this is really hard to do, but you can jump from the top of this thing
[2011.72s -> 2014.12s]  up to that ledge and then right cards like right up there.
[2014.12s -> 2016.36s]  I think VR Josh, that was a great moment.
[2016.36s -> 2018.52s]  Stirred tabbed out of a source engine game.
[2020.10s -> 2020.34s]  All right.
[2020.34s -> 2021.70s]  So you jump from here to up there.
[2024.07s -> 2024.31s]  Okay.
[2024.95s -> 2026.47s]  But I think you have to like be running on that.
[2026.47s -> 2028.39s]  So you have to like run in a circle, which is why.
[2028.39s -> 2029.67s]  Bro got it first try.
[2029.67s -> 2030.71s]  Where are we going from here?
[2030.71s -> 2031.67s]  That's not the hard part.
[2031.67s -> 2035.74s]  Oh, now we're to get on top of the metal circle.
[2037.42s -> 2039.88s]  And then you have to be able to jump to the ledge.
[2044.49s -> 2045.61s]  He's killing it tonight.
[2046.25s -> 2047.69s]  Now guide me a little more.
[2049.02s -> 2053.69s]  Uh, I forget exactly what you're aiming for, but you need to like land
[2053.69s -> 2058.86s]  like on the ledge so you can get up to that high ground.
[2058.86s -> 2064.38s]  Oh, yeah, that's that's the chat saying it's almost impossible.
[2064.38s -> 2070.07s]  It is possible.
[2070.07s -> 2072.55s]  Dude, I we have switched bodies.
[2072.55s -> 2077.58s]  I don't fucking just wait, just wait.
[2077.58s -> 2078.46s]  I'll get it.
[2078.46s -> 2088.30s]  Stripping is eating right now.
[2088.30s -> 2088.62s]  Okay.
[2090.38s -> 2091.50s]  What is that?
[2091.50s -> 2092.14s]  Okay.
[2092.14s -> 2095.03s]  Stripping is eating right now.
[2095.03s -> 2099.75s]  Like he's like, I was trying to be better so he wouldn't enjoy me being bad.
[2099.75s -> 2102.95s]  And I've jumped off the map twice in like 10 minutes of gameplay.
[2102.95s -> 2107.98s]  So right now, Stripping, you tell him, Stripping just took a big bite out of
[2107.98s -> 2109.58s]  like a fucking steak and cheese, whatever he's eating.
[2109.58s -> 2113.42s]  He's probably just like, he's like laughing and like food just came out of his mouth.
[2113.42s -> 2114.62s]  Yeah, we're not going to.
[2114.62s -> 2115.90s]  I don't want to sit around and do this jump.
[2116.78s -> 2118.30s]  It's you're not getting it.
[2118.30s -> 2119.42s]  Is it actually patched up?
[2119.42s -> 2119.90s]  It's patched.
[2119.90s -> 2120.30s]  It's patched.
[2120.30s -> 2120.78s]  It's patched.
[2121.26s -> 2124.30s]  It is patched, but it is possible, but it's incredibly incredible.
[2124.30s -> 2124.62s]  Okay.
[2124.62s -> 2128.06s]  So the number one question is, here's our two options.
[2128.06s -> 2129.02s]  Let's go fight Melania.
[2129.02s -> 2132.89s]  No, no, no, there are there.
[2132.89s -> 2135.26s]  There's a way to get down to that.
[2135.26s -> 2141.75s]  No, no, there's a way to get down to Rikard.
[2141.75s -> 2144.39s]  You get ported there without having to do anything.
[2144.39s -> 2144.95s]  I know it.
[2144.95s -> 2146.55s]  I've done it accidentally before.
[2146.55s -> 2149.14s]  How do you get down to that room?
[2149.14s -> 2150.58s]  The one right before Rikard?
[2150.58s -> 2151.86s]  There's a way to get down there.
[2151.86s -> 2154.39s]  It's part of a quest.
[2154.39s -> 2155.83s]  You can't do the quest.
[2155.83s -> 2156.31s]  Okay.
[2156.39s -> 2157.27s]  The envelopes.
[2157.27s -> 2160.54s]  Okay, let's go kill Melania.
[2160.54s -> 2160.78s]  Fine.
[2161.50s -> 2162.30s]  All right.
[2162.30s -> 2163.58s]  My God, dude.
[2163.58s -> 2164.14s]  We're doing this.
[2164.14s -> 2165.74s]  We're attempting this one time.
[2165.74s -> 2166.30s]  And then we are.
[2166.94s -> 2167.74s]  I'm telling you right now.
[2167.74s -> 2172.78s]  I am immediately porting to one millennia fight, one millennia fight.
[2172.78s -> 2173.42s]  And then we are.
[2173.42s -> 2174.54s]  And I'm talking about we are.
[2174.54s -> 2179.06s]  I'm porting to outside of Landell.
[2179.06s -> 2180.42s]  Yeah, we're gonna go do land.
[2180.42s -> 2181.94s]  You understand the terms here, right?
[2181.94s -> 2182.26s]  Yeah.
[2182.26s -> 2182.90s]  You get the terms?
[2185.06s -> 2185.46s]  Yes.
[2185.46s -> 2188.02s]  Also, do I have a way to turn in the other?
[2188.02s -> 2188.90s]  I got Mogues room.
[2188.90s -> 2191.06s]  Do we have the tower so we can go to the top?
[2191.06s -> 2193.11s]  I forget which one is Mogues.
[2193.11s -> 2195.42s]  Let's head away.
[2195.42s -> 2200.73s]  Because I know we have access to one more tower.
[2200.73s -> 2202.41s]  Everybody's saying like, how do they not know this?
[2202.97s -> 2203.85s]  You guys have to understand.
[2203.85s -> 2204.73s]  You have to remember.
[2204.73s -> 2208.09s]  There was like an entire human history worth of stuff in this game.
[2208.81s -> 2216.25s]  It's like an entire human history with like lore books and like thousands of pieces of documents.
[2216.25s -> 2218.17s]  It's a lot.
[2218.81s -> 2219.93s]  So we don't remember.
[2220.57s -> 2239.19s]  Come on, bring it on.
[2253.96s -> 2254.44s]  Okay.
[2254.44s -> 2255.00s]  Be careful.
[2257.32s -> 2258.12s]  Pretty clean.
[2259.24s -> 2301.21s]  Not bad.
[2301.21s -> 2301.61s]  Pretty good.
[2304.06s -> 2304.46s]  Not good.
[2305.02s -> 2307.80s]  A little cautious.
[2308.84s -> 2309.48s]  That's why.
[2314.04s -> 2316.04s]  Dude, her fight should be in a room with pillars.
[2317.30s -> 2318.02s]  Actually, kind of should be.
[2318.02s -> 2318.82s]  Actual fight.
[2319.54s -> 2347.90s]  Oh, fuck.
[2348.54s -> 2349.98s]  Oh, fuck.
[2349.98s -> 2351.18s]  That was the worst time.
[2409.22s -> 2409.78s]  Just hit her.
[2411.30s -> 2412.74s]  Dude, I can't.
[2427.80s -> 2429.80s]  Just press the attack button once, dude.
[2429.80s -> 2430.52s]  What's the problem?
[2432.04s -> 2435.16s]  Dude, you're not allowed to play this video game against this character with a weapon
[2435.16s -> 2437.40s]  that's less than like a tenth of a second swing time.
[2437.96s -> 2439.24s]  I'm not supposed to come in here with a dagger.
[2474.89s -> 2478.89s]  You can't attack Millenia with a weapon that is like a two-handed sprinkler.
[2479.69s -> 2481.43s]  You just can't.
[2481.43s -> 2484.60s]  If I hit R1, I die.
[2484.60s -> 2491.46s]  I die if I hit R1.
[2491.46s -> 2492.26s]  Let me hit R1.
[2494.90s -> 2495.38s]  Dead.
[2495.38s -> 2503.24s]  There's no opportunity, man.
[2503.24s -> 2505.72s]  They give you enough opportunity to swing with a katana.
[2505.72s -> 2508.36s]  They made that character for katanas only.
[2508.36s -> 2510.04s]  Hey, don't you have a moon veil you were going to give me?
[2511.88s -> 2513.43s]  I did, didn't I?
[2513.43s -> 2514.46s]  Yeah.
[2514.46s -> 2517.46s]  Jump attack if it takes too long.
[2519.11s -> 2525.06s]  No, you should jump attack.
[2525.06s -> 2528.34s]  And don't you have like multiple fully upgraded two-handers?
[2528.34s -> 2531.54s]  Because two-hand, like they nerfed it a bit, but dual wielding two-handers
[2531.54s -> 2535.48s]  and doing jump attacks on her is actually like pretty good.
[2536.52s -> 2540.76s]  And then I have a claw talisman for bonus on jump attack.
[2540.76s -> 2543.21s]  Let's do it again.
[2543.21s -> 2543.53s]  Okay.
[2543.53s -> 2546.07s]  Are we changing anything?
[2546.07s -> 2546.55s]  No, I got it.
[2546.55s -> 2547.35s]  Want the talisman?
[2547.35s -> 2548.71s]  Are you going to give me the moon veil?
[2548.71s -> 2549.67s]  I got the jump attack.
[2552.94s -> 2553.98s]  Didn't I give you the moon?
[2553.98s -> 2554.86s]  Oh, I thought I gave it to you.
[2556.23s -> 2556.63s]  Did you?
[2557.88s -> 2558.60s]  Yeah.
[2558.60s -> 2559.96s]  Wasn't I like, oh, look, look, look.
[2559.96s -> 2561.40s]  And you're like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[2562.04s -> 2564.12s]  I think I told you not to give it to me.
[2564.12s -> 2565.10s]  How come I don't?
[2565.10s -> 2566.14s]  Did I sell it?
[2566.14s -> 2567.10s]  Oh, no, I have it.
[2567.10s -> 2567.42s]  Okay.
[2567.42s -> 2569.70s]  Well, it's like not upgraded.
[2569.70s -> 2571.83s]  Wait, moon veil has bleed on it?
[2571.83s -> 2573.48s]  I think so, yeah.
[2573.48s -> 2573.98s]  Why?
[2578.41s -> 2584.60s]  That's why it's easy mode.
[2586.47s -> 2586.71s]  All right.
[2586.71s -> 2587.75s]  I knew it had bleed.
[2587.75s -> 2588.95s]  No, let's get out of here.
[2588.95s -> 2589.91s]  I'm getting out of here.
[2589.91s -> 2591.51s]  How do I get out of here quick?
[2591.51s -> 2591.83s]  All right.
[2591.83s -> 2593.03s]  I'm just somber five.
[2593.03s -> 2593.99s]  I went to Capitol Rampart.
[2593.99s -> 2594.47s]  Go.
[2594.47s -> 2595.67s]  Do you have a somber five?
[2595.67s -> 2595.99s]  Yeah.
[2595.99s -> 2597.11s]  No, we're fighting her one more time.
[2597.11s -> 2597.83s]  No, no, no.
[2597.83s -> 2598.55s]  Do it now.
[2598.55s -> 2599.03s]  No.
[2599.03s -> 2599.35s]  Get out.
[2599.35s -> 2599.91s]  Get me out of here.
[2600.63s -> 2601.35s]  All right.
[2601.35s -> 2601.59s]  Okay.
[2601.59s -> 2602.31s]  We just lost it.
[2602.31s -> 2604.47s]  I was like, yeah, fucking this, fucking that.
[2604.47s -> 2605.59s]  I'm fucking this, fucking that.
[2605.59s -> 2606.07s]  No, no, no.
[2606.07s -> 2606.87s]  Get me out of here.
[2606.87s -> 2608.23s]  We just need some levels.
[2609.51s -> 2611.42s]  No, get me out of here.
[2611.42s -> 2612.46s]  It's somber five.
[2612.46s -> 2619.54s]  I'll give you a somber five.
[2619.54s -> 2620.98s]  Get me out of here.
[2620.98s -> 2622.02s]  There's no way.
[2622.02s -> 2623.46s]  There's no way we're going to sit there
[2623.46s -> 2626.10s]  for like another two hours where I just continue.
[2626.10s -> 2628.18s]  Every time we lose, I'm going to pull.
[2628.18s -> 2628.90s]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[2628.90s -> 2630.26s]  I'm going to say exactly what's going to happen.
[2630.26s -> 2631.06s]  I'm going to grab this.
[2631.70s -> 2632.98s]  This is coming up here.
[2632.98s -> 2636.02s]  And I'm going to talk like this really, really angrily.
[2636.66s -> 2640.34s]  Like, I'm very, this is, look at how intent this is.
[2640.34s -> 2640.98s]  Somber five.
[2642.63s -> 2643.51s]  Somber five, daddy.
[2643.51s -> 2644.47s]  Daddy, somber five.
[2645.91s -> 2646.47s]  Listen to me.
[2647.19s -> 2650.10s]  How many do you just want?
[2650.82s -> 2651.30s]  Just one.
[2656.58s -> 2657.30s]  Do you have an eight?
[2660.36s -> 2661.56s]  An eight and an ancient.
[2662.12s -> 2663.50s]  I have an eight.
[2664.06s -> 2665.50s]  I do not have an ancient.
[2665.50s -> 2666.14s]  Give me the eight.
[2668.23s -> 2669.75s]  You've taken all these from me.
[2669.75s -> 2671.27s]  I've given you like so much.
[2671.27s -> 2673.67s]  Yeah, but these are so much more valuable and you've taken them.
[2674.55s -> 2678.15s]  We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we.
[2678.15s -> 2679.43s]  Let's go to the road of the manor real quick.
[2680.15s -> 2680.87s]  Okay.
[2680.87s -> 2682.79s]  Are you doing, are you upgrading Moonville?
[2682.79s -> 2683.27s]  Yeah.
[2683.27s -> 2684.71s]  No, I don't like this arc.
[2684.71s -> 2686.01s]  You don't like this arc?
[2686.01s -> 2688.49s]  I've been using a fucking long sword all game.
[2688.49s -> 2690.33s]  You have gone through like six weapons.
[2690.33s -> 2691.69s]  You upgraded the finger.
[2691.69s -> 2693.21s]  You upgraded Giza's wheel.
[2693.21s -> 2694.89s]  Hey, where is my finger, by the way?
[2694.89s -> 2696.57s]  I want that shit back.
[2696.57s -> 2700.90s]  Oh, I'm taking up all the sombers.
[2700.90s -> 2703.75s]  This is like the first time.
[2703.75s -> 2707.14s]  Hey, hey, I'm getting, I'm getting you your fucking finger.
[2707.14s -> 2707.94s]  Wait, wait, everyone relax.
[2707.94s -> 2708.98s]  And you can three finger my ass.
[2708.98s -> 2709.48s]  No, no.
[2712.01s -> 2713.21s]  What's going to happen?
[2713.21s -> 2715.21s]  You can do this, but not right now.
[2715.21s -> 2716.25s]  And I'll tell you why.
[2716.25s -> 2717.93s]  Because you're going to upgrade this.
[2717.93s -> 2721.29s]  You're going to, you're going to like do R1, L2, L2.
[2721.29s -> 2722.73s]  And you're going to go, all right, let's go fighter again.
[2723.98s -> 2725.42s]  No, we're going to go do Lane Doe.
[2726.46s -> 2728.30s]  No, you're going to want to take that to Millennia.
[2728.30s -> 2729.18s]  I know it.
[2729.18s -> 2730.50s]  I don't.
[2730.50s -> 2746.57s]  Oh, let's go.
[2746.57s -> 2747.07s]  Millennia?
[2747.69s -> 2749.93s]  No, I'm fucking, I haven't even upgraded a plus one yet.
[2750.57s -> 2752.17s]  Entertain yourself for a moment, dear.
[2752.17s -> 2753.21s]  Okay, fine.
[2753.21s -> 2767.62s]  I've actually never used Moonville.
[2767.62s -> 2768.34s]  It's so good.
[2768.34s -> 2769.30s]  It's unbelievably good.
[2769.86s -> 2772.26s]  Do you have a nine?
[2772.26s -> 2773.30s]  I do not.
[2773.30s -> 2775.54s]  Okay, I just need nine in ancient.
[2775.54s -> 2776.26s]  It would be max.
[2776.82s -> 2782.65s]  I don't even think I'm going to use it till it's max.
[2783.29s -> 2813.56s]  I wish I could just slide off.
[2813.56s -> 2815.16s]  Why am I doing this?
[2815.72s -> 2835.70s]  Okay, I'm just thinking about the good times, man.
[2836.26s -> 2840.89s]  I mean, Plastiducic, smoking up blood.
[2840.89s -> 2843.21s]  He didn't even fucking answer my call anymore.
[2843.21s -> 2850.79s]  I'm going to hang out with this motherfucker.
[2850.79s -> 2852.79s]  His weed sucks.
[2852.79s -> 2857.38s]  It's got this low quality dog shit weed.
[2857.38s -> 2860.74s]  It's so awful Plastiducic's had that fucking good shit.
[2860.74s -> 2875.19s]  All right, you ready?
[2875.19s -> 2878.33s]  Yeah, I voted to travel.
[2878.33s -> 2885.59s]  All right, vote to travel.
[2885.59s -> 2892.62s]  I knew he was going to do like L1, L2, L2.
[2892.62s -> 2894.70s]  And now he's going to be like, oh, I can beat Millennia by myself.
[2896.50s -> 2899.42s]  It's just like Neo.
[2899.42s -> 2900.22s]  Want to go give it a try?
[2901.02s -> 2902.84s]  No, I don't.
[2902.84s -> 2905.08s]  It's going to be really weak unless it's fully upgraded.
[2905.08s -> 2910.84s]  My whole build is on some cheesy Glintstone pebble Ash of War gimmick.
[2910.84s -> 2913.72s]  Hey, by the way, we're going to have to fight over the next larval tier.
[2917.13s -> 2919.03s]  I'm going to do rock, paper, scissors for it.
[2919.03s -> 2923.43s]  I thought I had one.
[2923.43s -> 2924.39s]  Oh, you do.
[2924.39s -> 2930.22s]  I don't know.
[2930.22s -> 2932.14s]  You have so much stuff in your inventory.
[2932.14s -> 2933.34s]  Do you need a larval?
[2933.34s -> 2933.98s]  Yeah, I have one.
[2935.37s -> 2936.09s]  Build to hold it.
[2936.09s -> 2939.05s]  Nah, for now, because I feel like this is going to be an opportunity
[2939.05s -> 2940.01s]  where one of us is going to go.
[2940.01s -> 2941.69s]  I hate everything that I'm doing right now.
[2942.57s -> 2943.37s]  Spoiler alert.
[2943.37s -> 2945.45s]  Those of you that are watching the VOD right now, it's me.
[2946.33s -> 2949.45s]  So in like an hour or so, I'll be respecting to something else.
[2956.34s -> 2957.06s]  Nice.
[2957.06s -> 2968.46s]  I actually really like this zone.
[2973.56s -> 2974.36s]  Ooh, that's a lot.
[2976.98s -> 2978.98s]  Your favorite Elden Ring zone.
[2979.54s -> 2980.26s]  Probably this one.
[2980.90s -> 2982.58s]  No, it's Limgrave.
[2986.04s -> 2990.12s]  The reason why I like Lindell so much is because you start to realize
[2990.12s -> 2992.60s]  that you are so close to getting to the base of the tree.
[2993.48s -> 2997.80s]  And once you can see the opening there, it's almost like, wait a second.
[2998.12s -> 3004.82s]  Oh, you can go in it like I'm right there the whole time.
[3004.82s -> 3006.74s]  The game has been teasing this gigantic tree.
[3006.74s -> 3010.74s]  And when you're finally there, it's this moment of holy shit.
[3010.74s -> 3011.94s]  I'm here right now.
[3011.94s -> 3013.30s]  I'm actually at this place.
[3014.34s -> 3019.18s]  It's been a distant thing for potentially tens of hours.
[3020.46s -> 3021.26s]  Now it's right here.
[3021.82s -> 3022.87s]  That's not in the game.
[3024.84s -> 3030.04s]  God from software does not fucking miss except for when they made Millennium.
[3030.04s -> 3030.92s]  It is big time.
[3038.79s -> 3039.43s]  Where are you?
[3040.07s -> 3040.55s]  I don't know.
[3042.52s -> 3043.16s]  Where are you?
[3043.88s -> 3046.12s]  I had lobster and doot at me.
[3046.12s -> 3047.40s]  Oh, you're dead?
[3047.40s -> 3047.88s]  Yeah.
[3047.88s -> 3048.68s]  Oh, you die.
[3048.68s -> 3049.88s]  How come I didn't even hear you die?
[3050.92s -> 3054.92s]  Because you were talking about how much you love Elden Ring.
[3056.49s -> 3057.29s]  You died.
[3057.29s -> 3058.33s]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[3058.33s -> 3059.21s]  Who even killed me?
[3061.98s -> 3062.70s]  Holy shit.
[3063.34s -> 3065.69s]  That was somehow your fault.
[3066.89s -> 3067.37s]  Fuck you.
[3071.30s -> 3072.50s]  Where are you now?
[3072.50s -> 3073.78s]  I went back to where you were.
[3073.78s -> 3076.66s]  I was on my way back because there's like a bonfire right
[3076.66s -> 3076.90s]  there.
[3079.46s -> 3082.58s]  No, I don't think millennia is not that bad.
[3082.58s -> 3084.23s]  It just is.
[3086.47s -> 3087.43s]  She's not that bad.
[3087.43s -> 3088.39s]  She just is.
[3089.27s -> 3091.67s]  I'm back into like jumping instead of rolling mode.
[3092.31s -> 3092.63s]  Really?
[3093.51s -> 3095.27s]  Yeah, my brain needs to reset a little bit.
[3096.95s -> 3098.71s]  Yeah, because short-term memory took over yesterday,
[3098.71s -> 3100.47s]  but long-term memory took over this morning.
[3100.47s -> 3101.83s]  That's interesting how that works.
[3101.83s -> 3112.87s]  This lobster is huge.
[3113.51s -> 3115.91s]  Please kill it.
[3115.91s -> 3116.63s]  It's like one hit.
[3117.19s -> 3118.15s]  It's going to shoot me again.
[3120.57s -> 3126.92s]  Oh, you are unhappy right now.
[3128.46s -> 3129.26s]  It's all right.
[3129.26s -> 3130.54s]  I'm glad stripping is happy.
[3131.96s -> 3133.00s]  That's the problem.
[3133.00s -> 3134.44s]  Stripping is in your head.
[3135.08s -> 3137.64s]  See, when you died from that lobster shot right there,
[3138.36s -> 3139.72s]  all you could think about was stripping,
[3139.72s -> 3141.48s]  just like spitting food out of his mouth,
[3141.48s -> 3143.32s]  pointing at the screen and like laughing.
[3143.88s -> 3144.28s]  You know what I mean?
[3144.28s -> 3148.12s]  Like a full open mouth and like mashed potatoes and shit.
[3148.12s -> 3149.56s]  Gravy comes out of his mouth and stuff.
[3149.56s -> 3150.28s]  That's what you're seeing.
[3150.92s -> 3152.20s]  You need to get stripping out of your head.
[3153.51s -> 3154.15s]  I can't.
[3154.15s -> 3155.03s]  He's too handsome.
[3158.92s -> 3160.28s]  Yeah, that's what's happening right now.
[3161.54s -> 3163.54s]  Yeah, he's eating a whole turkey dinner right now.
[3163.54s -> 3166.82s]  He's got stuffing and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.
[3166.82s -> 3170.66s]  I am not going to die again the rest of the stream.
[3174.82s -> 3178.33s]  I am activating blood cult initiate.
[3179.05s -> 3182.76s]  Oh, dark gamer god mode.
[3182.76s -> 3185.08s]  Oh, I grant you my soul.
[3185.72s -> 3188.55s]  Not you.
[3188.55s -> 3190.39s]  I'm talking to the ancient deep gods.
[3190.39s -> 3194.07s]  That seems like a really bad thing to sell your soul for
[3194.07s -> 3195.59s]  is to like be good at Elton.
[3196.55s -> 3198.07s]  No, it's all games.
[3202.68s -> 3203.00s]  Okay.
[3203.56s -> 3205.34s]  You wouldn't understand.
[3205.98s -> 3207.90s]  So what you're hoping for is you're hoping for like you dodge,
[3207.90s -> 3209.82s]  dodge, dodge, stripping, sitting there like,
[3209.82s -> 3211.42s]  okay, you know that scene in Lord of the Rings
[3211.42s -> 3214.86s]  where like the king is like eating the tomatoes
[3214.86s -> 3217.03s]  and shit during the battle?
[3217.03s -> 3218.95s]  Like you're just waiting for that moment.
[3218.95s -> 3221.35s]  It's cutting to stripping like you're dodging, dodging,
[3221.35s -> 3224.15s]  like eating the chicken and shit, stripping his mouth.
[3224.15s -> 3227.43s]  What the fuck is this fucking tomato eating noise?
[3227.43s -> 3228.87s]  Have you never seen Lord of the Rings?
[3228.87s -> 3230.41s]  I don't remember this scene.
[3231.37s -> 3233.94s]  Oh, have you not seen Lord of the Rings?
[3233.94s -> 3235.22s]  The scene, how do you not remember this?
[3235.86s -> 3239.62s]  The other recent prime video Lord of the Rings show
[3239.62s -> 3242.58s]  erased all of my memory of Lord of the Rings.
[3243.30s -> 3247.56s]  Oh shit, that's a dragon.
[3254.30s -> 3256.06s]  All he knows is Neo now.
[3257.56s -> 3260.60s]  That's all you have up there is like Neo information.
[3261.40s -> 3262.28s]  It's true.
[3262.28s -> 3266.28s]  I just, I like go 100% in a thing
[3266.28s -> 3269.43s]  and then everything else is just removed from the brain.
[3269.43s -> 3273.27s]  How far, how close are you to completing Neo 2?
[3273.27s -> 3273.91s]  No idea.
[3274.87s -> 3275.83s]  I wonder how close you are.
[3276.92s -> 3278.12s]  It feels like I'm getting close.
[3279.40s -> 3281.96s]  I decided I wanted to play a little today,
[3282.76s -> 3285.72s]  but I decided like if we're going to keep playing Elden Ring,
[3286.36s -> 3289.34s]  I'm not doing it, cutting myself off
[3289.34s -> 3290.38s]  because it's going to keep,
[3291.42s -> 3294.09s]  I don't know, my brain is just going to turn to mush.
[3294.73s -> 3299.10s]  True, that's all right.
[3300.79s -> 3303.62s]  You could, I mean, hey,
[3304.18s -> 3306.58s]  it's not a bad thing to have something you really like
[3306.58s -> 3310.22s]  to be able to do whenever you want.
[3310.22s -> 3311.10s]  That's not a bad thing.
[3315.54s -> 3318.18s]  In fact, I feel like a lot of people might be envious of that
[3318.18s -> 3321.38s]  because, oh shit, like, oh, I did this, now what?
[3321.38s -> 3322.74s]  I got nothing to do, nothing to play.
[3322.74s -> 3323.86s]  I wish there was some better games.
[3323.86s -> 3326.10s]  You got something that you're ready just to go right back to.
[3327.42s -> 3331.74s]  Yeah, I was getting annoyed when streamers are like,
[3331.74s -> 3333.50s]  it's a fucking game drought right now.
[3333.50s -> 3335.50s]  There's like no games, there's nothing.
[3335.50s -> 3336.14s]  Are you one of those?
[3336.14s -> 3338.46s]  Are you one of those like there's no games right now?
[3338.46s -> 3340.30s]  Because I don't, you don't seem like you'd be one
[3340.30s -> 3343.66s]  because you're willing to go back and play fucking driver in the PS1.
[3344.38s -> 3347.02s]  My most played game on stream is House Lipper.
[3347.02s -> 3350.22s]  I think, yeah, this is not the right person to ask this.
[3351.02s -> 3353.50s]  Okay, but yeah, no, I know what you mean.
[3354.46s -> 3359.16s]  Look, there's like 20 years, 30 years, a millennia of video games.
[3359.16s -> 3359.72s]  Just pick one.
[3361.16s -> 3364.97s]  That didn't work.
[3365.69s -> 3377.62s]  Wait, there's a millennia of video games?
[3378.42s -> 3378.90s]  Yep.
[3379.54s -> 3381.56s]  I stole that from Chad.
[3383.80s -> 3386.36s]  It sounds like a Chad comment now you say it.
[3391.26s -> 3392.78s]  Anybody that says there's no games,
[3392.78s -> 3395.50s]  I don't want to hear it if you haven't played Gex.
[3398.18s -> 3399.86s]  You haven't beat Chrono Trigger yet.
[3399.86s -> 3400.26s]  It's true.
[3401.78s -> 3402.66s]  Yeah, I've never been done.
[3406.60s -> 3409.08s]  I like how you're actually experiencing the game still.
[3409.72s -> 3410.68s]  This is still cool.
[3410.68s -> 3415.27s]  I got so lost in this area for a really long time.
[3416.33s -> 3418.97s]  It's, it is very, very easy to get lost here.
[3419.53s -> 3421.34s]  I think I have been down there.
[3421.34s -> 3422.06s]  I'm just forgetting.
[3422.62s -> 3424.86s]  There's a I'm trying to I this is okay.
[3424.86s -> 3426.06s]  This is my favorite area.
[3426.06s -> 3427.82s]  I still have no idea where the hell I'm going.
[3427.82s -> 3430.62s]  Oh, there's an I think there's an elevator in here that takes us.
[3430.62s -> 3433.18s]  Yeah, you go down to the kind of courtyard level
[3433.18s -> 3434.30s]  and then there's a few ways to go.
[3435.56s -> 3437.40s]  I know that when you get to the top,
[3437.40s -> 3439.88s]  you jump off the roof and you land on the other roof
[3439.88s -> 3441.88s]  and then you skip the area and you see bed curses
[3441.88s -> 3443.96s]  that item right there in a regular playthrough.
[3443.96s -> 3444.92s]  Saved a little bit of time.
[3446.28s -> 3447.96s]  This guy kind of knows where he's at.
[3449.24s -> 3451.59s]  This guy is like aware of this.
[3452.55s -> 3456.07s]  And that thing's going to be really annoying.
[3456.07s -> 3457.11s]  Where even is it?
[3457.11s -> 3457.99s]  Oh, I don't know.
[3459.98s -> 3463.98s]  Um, this is what is that?
[3465.35s -> 3466.15s]  Is that what?
[3466.15s -> 3466.71s]  What is this?
[3466.71s -> 3467.35s]  A dragon?
[3467.91s -> 3468.71s]  Wait, I'm poisoned.
[3468.71s -> 3470.47s]  What is what the fuck even is in the building here?
[3471.56s -> 3473.96s]  That's a dragon or a gargoyle.
[3474.68s -> 3478.71s]  I've anchored it.
[3479.27s -> 3481.35s]  Wait, did you jump?
[3481.35s -> 3482.79s]  What side did you jump down?
[3482.79s -> 3483.43s]  I didn't jump down.
[3483.43s -> 3483.99s]  I'm still up here.
[3483.99s -> 3485.91s]  I was hitting the wing inside this room.
[3485.91s -> 3486.63s]  Oh, come down here.
[3486.63s -> 3488.15s]  This guy's actually hard and sucks.
[3490.06s -> 3493.13s]  Well, I kind of said I wasn't going to die again.
[3496.63s -> 3513.91s]  All right, I'll take care of it.
[3513.91s -> 3521.06s]  Oh, yeah, that guy's usually here.
[3521.06s -> 3524.62s]  I wonder maybe forever here.
[3525.26s -> 3528.74s]  He's that good of a guardsman.
[3529.30s -> 3536.25s]  Oh, God.
[3536.97s -> 3541.08s]  Is that coming through the wall?
[3542.04s -> 3543.08s]  Holy shit.
[3543.96s -> 3549.03s]  He just turned this whole area into a virtual boy game.
[3549.59s -> 3552.81s]  I've said that before pretty recently.
[3554.52s -> 3555.40s]  No repeat jokes.
[3555.40s -> 3556.44s]  This is a rehearsal.
[3556.44s -> 3558.28s]  Hey, sometimes the good ones get to stay.
[3561.91s -> 3564.71s]  You imagine in the like, where was the fire?
[3564.71s -> 3568.46s]  Oh, oh, that's where he is.
[3569.26s -> 3570.38s]  Oh, my God.
[3571.34s -> 3574.74s]  It's got a lot of health.
[3574.74s -> 3575.46s]  Yeah.
[3575.46s -> 3576.58s]  Can it actually hurt us though?
[3576.58s -> 3580.74s]  Oh, he says as my head gets pancake.
[3583.83s -> 3585.19s]  Wait, it's up in the air.
[3585.91s -> 3588.71s]  I think we're safe from the fire though.
[3590.49s -> 3591.45s]  I guess not.
[3591.45s -> 3593.37s]  Can you stop saying shit like that?
[3597.05s -> 3598.17s]  It's like a Marvel movie.
[3598.97s -> 3599.37s]  Oh, man.
[3599.37s -> 3600.33s]  It's all right.
[3600.33s -> 3601.61s]  Fire can't get us in here.
[3603.21s -> 3605.13s]  Whoa, all right.
[3605.13s -> 3605.85s]  Burnt me.
[3605.85s -> 3607.21s]  What the heck, Star Lord?
[3609.13s -> 3610.09s]  Burnt me?
[3610.09s -> 3611.37s]  It burnt me.
[3611.37s -> 3613.29s]  Oh, burp me, Star Lord.
[3613.77s -> 3614.25s]  I like that.
[3614.25s -> 3615.21s]  I like that version.
[3616.25s -> 3623.21s]  Legendary in here.
[3624.33s -> 3628.31s]  Not going to minus two that one.
[3628.31s -> 3628.87s]  Get out of here.
[3629.43s -> 3633.67s]  Oh, man.
[3633.67s -> 3634.63s]  That's, that's unfortunate.
[3634.63s -> 3636.63s]  That joke went really well in rehearsal.
[3636.63s -> 3637.67s]  Lord Rune.
[3638.31s -> 3639.91s]  That's like 30, 40K, right?
[3640.79s -> 3643.03s]  Oh, yeah.
[3643.03s -> 3643.75s]  I don't have power.
[3644.23s -> 3648.89s]  I'm trying to do something.
[3648.89s -> 3650.09s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[3650.73s -> 3655.35s]  The dragons have blood.
[3657.38s -> 3658.10s]  Apparently.
[3658.58s -> 3659.14s]  This can I make?
[3659.14s -> 3659.94s]  Can I make him bleed?
[3660.82s -> 3661.46s]  I wonder.
[3662.90s -> 3664.14s]  You should be able to.
[3664.78s -> 3666.63s]  At least the fire can't get us in.
[3680.86s -> 3688.34s]  Oh, I don't even know what you're swinging at.
[3688.34s -> 3690.09s]  But oh, you can't.
[3690.65s -> 3691.61s]  You couldn't see it.
[3691.61s -> 3691.85s]  No.
[3693.46s -> 3695.38s]  Do we we both stack bleed together
[3695.38s -> 3696.74s]  if we're both bleeding, right?
[3696.74s -> 3697.94s]  I believe that's accurate.
[3697.94s -> 3698.18s]  Yes.
[3698.90s -> 3700.97s]  I mean, I don't see why not.
[3702.01s -> 3703.21s]  I think the dragon is on.
[3703.21s -> 3704.33s]  I think the dragon is on the roof.
[3710.15s -> 3710.87s]  No.
[3710.87s -> 3712.17s]  Where do you go?
[3712.17s -> 3713.37s]  There's a lot of guys in this room
[3713.37s -> 3714.97s]  and they're all aggroed to the dragon.
[3718.33s -> 3722.79s]  They are fighting the dragon.
[3727.99s -> 3728.71s]  Oh, shit.
[3731.43s -> 3732.07s]  I don't know.
[3732.87s -> 3734.15s]  It's a fucking jellyfish.
[3737.51s -> 3738.15s]  It's a spell.
[3738.15s -> 3739.11s]  He's casting bubble.
[3748.81s -> 3749.85s]  Oh, my God.
[3749.85s -> 3750.25s]  Dragons.
[3750.25s -> 3751.29s]  Dragons almost dead.
[3759.56s -> 3760.12s]  How do we get?
[3769.10s -> 3771.22s]  We're supposed to go like down
[3771.22s -> 3772.34s]  to the courtyard down there.
[3773.06s -> 3773.86s]  Yeah, I'm trying to.
[3773.86s -> 3775.06s]  I just want to kill the dragon.
[3775.06s -> 3776.02s]  Yeah, it's smart.
[3776.98s -> 3778.10s]  Nice wicked spot.
[3779.06s -> 3781.40s]  Put your head up here, please.
[3782.12s -> 3782.84s]  There it is.
[3783.48s -> 3784.78s]  Come here.
[3784.78s -> 3787.11s]  Why do I need mana?
[3788.68s -> 3788.92s]  What?
[3789.64s -> 3792.20s]  I didn't just take this took mana.
[3793.08s -> 3797.61s]  It's a webinar that I'm pretty sure they all do.
[3803.93s -> 3804.89s]  You're hitting it right now.
[3804.89s -> 3805.93s]  Oh, yeah, I guess so.
[3808.89s -> 3810.57s]  I just see a health bar in the sky
[3810.57s -> 3811.53s]  that's like taking.
[3812.49s -> 3814.23s]  OK, great job.
[3814.87s -> 3818.95s]  We get an item.
[3822.12s -> 3823.56s]  Do you think that when dragons die,
[3823.56s -> 3824.68s]  they turn to dust like that
[3824.68s -> 3826.36s]  because of how much weed they've been smoking with you?
[3826.92s -> 3830.63s]  Like all the vapors just come out.
[3835.11s -> 3836.55s]  And it was all right.
[3837.11s -> 3840.20s]  It was all right.
[3840.20s -> 3841.56s]  Oh, he's doing the jump strap.
[3846.01s -> 3846.89s]  I didn't get it from here.
[3846.89s -> 3847.77s]  You go down.
[3847.77s -> 3848.89s]  I don't think this is OK.
[3848.89s -> 3849.45s]  But we.
[3849.45s -> 3856.66s]  Yeah, hold on.
[3856.66s -> 3857.30s]  Great sword.
[3857.30s -> 3858.42s]  I got a few things here.
[3858.42s -> 3859.22s]  Let me see what these are.
[3861.42s -> 3863.64s]  Yeah, that's my first carrion.
[3863.64s -> 3865.64s]  I've upgraded carrion staff all game.
[3865.64s -> 3866.76s]  My first carrion spell.
[3870.98s -> 3872.18s]  I think I have some carrion shit
[3872.18s -> 3874.17s]  that you would want if you like.
[3874.17s -> 3874.89s]  But you don't.
[3874.89s -> 3876.97s]  I mean, we're changing our builds so frequently.
[3878.17s -> 3878.65s]  I'm not.
[3879.29s -> 3881.05s]  I've been using the same.
[3881.05s -> 3882.73s]  I switched once and then I switched back
[3882.73s -> 3883.85s]  because I realized that was wrong.
[3884.81s -> 3886.89s]  That is the that is more than I have.
[3887.77s -> 3892.81s]  OK, Mr.
[3892.81s -> 3895.61s]  Like I have upgraded like seven weapons this run.
[3895.61s -> 3896.57s]  I have what?
[3896.57s -> 3899.37s]  Plus one to plus two in three or four weapons.
[3901.91s -> 3905.19s]  I only have two items that are over plus five
[3905.19s -> 3906.33s]  and one of them is the finger.
[3906.33s -> 3908.09s]  It doesn't count because you stole it from me.
[3908.65s -> 3911.02s]  OK, it's one of these things.
[3912.30s -> 3912.86s]  Get ready.
[3912.86s -> 3914.54s]  Oh, I don't have the heels anymore.
[3914.70s -> 3916.62s]  Which is like half the reason I did it.
[3916.62s -> 3917.26s]  No, no, no.
[3917.26s -> 3918.46s]  This thing is OK.
[3918.46s -> 3919.42s]  This isn't OK.
[3919.42s -> 3920.78s]  This guy is just it's one of those
[3922.14s -> 3923.66s]  centuries or what it's what are they called?
[3925.48s -> 3928.68s]  I'll tell you the weapon that you get from these things
[3928.68s -> 3929.88s]  are is actually really fun.
[3931.16s -> 3934.44s]  Yeah, the dual welding light weapons.
[3936.57s -> 3937.61s]  I don't know what's happening.
[3937.61s -> 3938.65s]  My screen like froze.
[3946.78s -> 3947.50s]  Crucible.
[3947.50s -> 3948.94s]  Oh, I can look cool now.
[3949.75s -> 3951.75s]  I also got a crucible tree armor.
[3952.47s -> 3959.00s]  I got the armor.
[3959.00s -> 3959.80s]  You got the helmet.
[3959.80s -> 3961.00s]  I'm so much hotter than you.
[3962.26s -> 3969.86s]  No, you look like you're going to play Warframe.
[3971.22s -> 3973.46s]  You do.
[3974.02s -> 3982.92s]  OK, look.
[3989.58s -> 3992.39s]  Is she talking to you?
[3993.59s -> 3994.55s]  No, she did earlier.
[3998.30s -> 4002.86s]  I told her I am already married and I can't be seen with you.
[4005.86s -> 4007.38s]  The Lord's runes.
[4007.38s -> 4009.06s]  Do I need to use that for anything else?
[4009.70s -> 4014.25s]  Or is it just purely an enormous amount of runes?
[4014.41s -> 4017.88s]  Uh, wow, that's a lot.
[4018.52s -> 4031.05s]  We break 100 K.
[4032.09s -> 4032.65s]  Come on.
[4032.65s -> 4033.77s]  Can we break 100 K?
[4041.02s -> 4041.50s]  Never mind.
[4041.50s -> 4042.46s]  It wasn't the magic.
[4042.46s -> 4043.42s]  It was an ash of war.
[4044.14s -> 4066.94s]  Guys, we didn't break 100 K out here.
[4068.39s -> 4070.15s]  There is on one side.
[4070.15s -> 4074.06s]  There's usually a tour left.
[4074.06s -> 4075.34s]  There's a big scary man.
[4076.14s -> 4079.05s]  OK, for one second, I was like, what did the mod do?
[4079.05s -> 4080.25s]  And why is this dragon so big?
[4084.94s -> 4088.87s]  How what is happening?
[4088.87s -> 4091.91s]  But like a meteor landed on my head.
[4093.29s -> 4093.77s]  Meteor?
[4094.41s -> 4098.78s]  Yeah, I have no idea what that was.
[4100.92s -> 4103.48s]  There's usually an ulcerated tree spirit over here somewhere.
[4103.48s -> 4104.20s]  Right?
[4104.20s -> 4108.47s]  It wasn't this thing, was it?
[4108.47s -> 4109.51s]  That was a lot of damage.
[4110.15s -> 4121.10s]  Yeah, there's like some big creature under the ground
[4121.10s -> 4125.75s]  that's occasionally hitting me inside this building.
[4125.75s -> 4127.83s]  OK, well, let's go find it.
[4128.63s -> 4129.99s]  Yeah, it's shaking the whole game.
[4130.63s -> 4133.08s]  It's a bear behind us.
[4133.32s -> 4136.02s]  Oh, there is a bear.
[4136.74s -> 4137.70s]  Oh, fuck.
[4137.70s -> 4138.50s]  That's a big one.
[4143.46s -> 4145.62s]  OK, he wasn't actually stuck.
[4145.62s -> 4146.66s]  He was just like pretending.
[4157.85s -> 4164.01s]  Oh, where's the bleed?
[4164.73s -> 4165.77s]  How many times I got to hit you?
[4166.65s -> 4184.66s]  He's this once would be nice.
[4185.46s -> 4190.36s]  Oh, you're going to me?
[4191.37s -> 4191.61s]  Yeah.
[4192.25s -> 4192.73s]  Once what?
[4193.53s -> 4194.47s]  Hitting him once.
[4195.19s -> 4199.94s]  Oh, he can't come down the hallway.
[4204.76s -> 4206.52s]  What is the bleed resistance on this bear?
[4206.52s -> 4207.24s]  Holy shit.
[4208.04s -> 4213.80s]  I just held this on his like butt for a solid five straight seconds.
[4220.74s -> 4222.98s]  I that was he dropped beast blood.
[4222.98s -> 4223.70s]  I don't like that.
[4225.18s -> 4227.74s]  All right, so we can either go up and going up
[4227.74s -> 4231.10s]  brings us to Godfrey's room.
[4232.42s -> 4232.66s]  Right.
[4233.46s -> 4234.95s]  I prefer Godfrey.
[4235.67s -> 4237.50s]  I already have one of these.
[4238.14s -> 4241.27s]  Or we can go down into the well
[4241.27s -> 4244.95s]  and go down to the what the shunning grounds or whatever it is.
[4245.59s -> 4249.11s]  Oh, the sewers down to the tree fingers.
[4249.11s -> 4253.27s]  The tree is also looks like kind of sneaking around down.
[4253.27s -> 4257.03s]  There is glint stone dragon, glint stone dragon.
[4258.07s -> 4260.07s]  Yeah, he's like totally blocking the whole sewer.
[4261.67s -> 4263.91s]  It like that's probably the not a good way to go right now.
[4268.22s -> 4272.38s]  Dude, dual Omen, dual well, dual Omen, dual Omen, please.
[4273.10s -> 4275.30s]  That's not a bad idea.
[4278.10s -> 4283.11s]  No, the mashed potatoes just shot out of his mouth.
[4284.31s -> 4286.95s]  The mashed potatoes just launched out of stripping's mouth.
[4289.00s -> 4290.36s]  God damn it, dude.
[4291.61s -> 4294.01s]  Dude, that was like a fucking looney tune episode.
[4296.25s -> 4300.39s]  Dude, I would be careful, man.
[4300.39s -> 4303.43s]  You stripping right now may have just eaten like a chicken wing
[4303.43s -> 4308.87s]  and it's like you may have choked him because that was so funny.
[4308.87s -> 4310.95s]  And he only said I don't think he's watching.
[4310.95s -> 4312.63s]  I don't think he's going to watch the VOD.
[4312.63s -> 4314.39s]  I just I'm not going to bring any of this up.
[4315.19s -> 4324.55s]  Dude, you were just you were like one, two, three, just right over the edge.
[4324.55s -> 4326.07s]  It was so perfect.
[4326.07s -> 4328.39s]  I was like totally spaced out in my head.
[4333.93s -> 4335.61s]  Oh, man, I only barely.
[4336.73s -> 4338.01s]  That was so perfect.
[4338.65s -> 4341.61s]  Well, a little fresh restart, reset my pact.
[4341.61s -> 4343.37s]  That has to be the ultimate fall joke.
[4348.57s -> 4350.09s]  Your reaction was immediate.
[4350.65s -> 4358.22s]  Sombra seven.
[4358.22s -> 4359.18s]  I'm not going to say that out loud.
[4359.18s -> 4360.30s]  I don't want him to know I have one of these.
[4360.30s -> 4360.78s]  It's mine.
[4363.24s -> 4364.12s]  I need a nine.
[4364.84s -> 4368.58s]  I needed a somber nine and a ancient one.
[4368.58s -> 4369.86s]  I'll take another Lord's rune.
[4370.58s -> 4372.09s]  An easy 50k.
[4372.09s -> 4376.15s]  Oh, another legendary hero's rune.
[4376.15s -> 4377.78s]  Oh, boy.
[4379.22s -> 4380.58s]  Todd, don't hit him.
[4381.30s -> 4385.40s]  No, his name was Carl.
[4385.40s -> 4387.56s]  That's the last thing he heard before he died, by the way.
[4388.30s -> 4391.90s]  He's been practicing the trombone was me in his ear.
[4391.90s -> 4395.59s]  It was just mocking him.
[4400.78s -> 4401.74s]  That's so fucked up.
[4407.18s -> 4407.66s]  That's a hard.
[4407.66s -> 4408.78s]  Yeah, it's a horrible way to go.
[4414.31s -> 4418.57s]  I got a remembrance of the regal ancestor.
[4418.57s -> 4420.95s]  I'm going to hold on to it.
[4420.95s -> 4427.22s]  I got a hero's rune level up.
[4427.22s -> 4428.55s]  That's not enough.
[4428.55s -> 4429.91s]  I wonder if these souls later.
[4431.03s -> 4431.75s]  Do you need some?
[4433.38s -> 4434.66s]  I'm 15k more.
[4434.66s -> 4438.82s]  I think I am willing to do something for you because I know that it's been a little rough.
[4439.62s -> 4440.26s]  Oh, God.
[4440.26s -> 4442.74s]  And then like a week later, he comes back with like,
[4442.74s -> 4446.09s]  remember that time that I gave you a Lord's rune?
[4446.09s -> 4448.25s]  Hey, remember on stream that time I gave you the Lord's rune?
[4448.97s -> 4450.97s]  And then he asked me to do something wicked.
[4451.61s -> 4451.77s]  Yeah.
[4451.77s -> 4452.73s]  Freaked up.
[4452.73s -> 4452.97s]  Yeah.
[4452.97s -> 4456.09s]  But I mean, I know I'm a little bit higher than you.
[4456.09s -> 4462.15s]  I feel like you should have that level up a couple of times.
[4462.15s -> 4462.63s]  Okay.
[4462.63s -> 4463.99s]  Just trying to do a good thing.
[4463.99s -> 4466.07s]  Just worried about what this is going to cost me.
[4466.07s -> 4466.79s]  Just don't forget.
[4467.59s -> 4469.03s]  Don't forget what I did.
[4469.03s -> 4469.59s]  Right?
[4469.59s -> 4470.47s]  Yeah, I know you won't.
[4470.47s -> 4471.27s]  I'll make sure you don't.
[4471.99s -> 4475.59s]  I mean, I think I left my souls from that jump.
[4475.59s -> 4478.15s]  I don't even I don't want to think about it.
[4478.87s -> 4487.66s]  What level are you after this?
[4487.66s -> 4488.16s]  15.
[4489.77s -> 4490.49s]  Be so bad.
[4492.70s -> 4495.02s]  Don't you start at like level 15?
[4495.02s -> 4496.94s]  You're not supposed to be 15 at this point in the game.
[4496.94s -> 4499.42s]  I need like 200 souls.
[4500.63s -> 4507.08s]  Just kill like one enemy.
[4507.08s -> 4508.52s]  You go back and kill Carl again.
[4519.54s -> 4519.86s]  Nice.
[4520.42s -> 4521.98s]  I got another sacred tear.
[4522.94s -> 4525.26s]  That was also a hero's rune.
[4525.98s -> 4526.62s]  Was it really?
[4528.04s -> 4529.24s]  Maybe you can level up more than once.
[4532.55s -> 4533.19s]  Foster tech.
[4534.58s -> 4535.06s]  Thank you.
[4535.06s -> 4536.90s]  Actually, did I go the wrong way?
[4539.45s -> 4546.33s]  You got to go up upstairs.
[4566.20s -> 4568.04s]  I opened something.
[4568.04s -> 4568.76s]  I don't know.
[4568.76s -> 4569.48s]  There was a lever.
[4570.44s -> 4571.56s]  I've never played this game before.
[4571.56s -> 4572.36s]  I don't know what that does.
[4583.91s -> 4584.79s]  Okay, let's go.
[4585.67s -> 4589.91s]  We can walk straight up to goad free or to what's this name?
[4591.35s -> 4591.99s]  Good free.
[4591.99s -> 4592.55s]  Gurd free.
[4592.55s -> 4593.43s]  What'd you say?
[4593.43s -> 4595.35s]  Gertrude up in the top of the God free.
[4596.54s -> 4599.26s]  Well, there's him and then there's the magical mystical man.
[4599.26s -> 4602.34s]  Yes, Gertrude.
[4626.92s -> 4627.64s]  Careful here.
[4628.28s -> 4633.22s]  Will they beat Gertrude first try?
[4633.22s -> 4634.18s]  Well, it depends who it is.
[4634.18s -> 4635.38s]  It might not be Gertrude.
[4635.38s -> 4639.61s]  It might be like it might be like fucking Placidusix again.
[4641.16s -> 4644.52s]  I hope it's not something bad because this room is very, very small.
[4644.52s -> 4645.00s]  Isn't it?
[4645.00s -> 4646.76s]  And we could get absolutely screwed here.
[4649.14s -> 4650.02s]  Legendary over there.
[4650.02s -> 4653.88s]  I have to get that could be a Lord's room.
[4654.52s -> 4658.70s]  Where?
[4658.78s -> 4660.52s]  Where that guy's hanging over there.
[4661.16s -> 4662.76s]  Watch out.
[4662.76s -> 4664.04s]  We got a plant on the tree.
[4664.04s -> 4664.92s]  Yeah, we do.
[4670.15s -> 4671.99s]  Okay, that's a lot of health.
[4674.07s -> 4674.55s]  Wait.
[4675.51s -> 4677.94s]  I don't think plants have blood.
[4678.50s -> 4679.30s]  Yes, they do.
[4679.30s -> 4680.50s]  It's called chlorophyll.
[4681.22s -> 4681.96s]  Let's just go.
[4682.52s -> 4704.02s]  Please.
[4704.66s -> 4705.94s]  I would do not dodge here.
[4705.94s -> 4714.14s]  I would just hold you right up.
[4714.14s -> 4714.46s]  Nice.
[4722.39s -> 4723.67s]  That's dangerous to do up here.
[4723.67s -> 4724.71s]  That's a lot of confidence.
[4725.51s -> 4730.95s]  Can you imagine staring this down and going?
[4730.95s -> 4734.39s]  Yeah, I think I'll do 10 cartwheels in a row down this.
[4735.27s -> 4736.95s]  That's not a good idea.
[4737.51s -> 4741.30s]  Hold on.
[4741.30s -> 4742.18s]  I want to get this item.
[4742.98s -> 4746.10s]  Yeah, I want to get it too because my items can be better than your item.
[4746.10s -> 4747.30s]  I bet you $100.
[4747.30s -> 4748.26s]  Mine is better than yours.
[4748.26s -> 4748.74s]  All right, fine.
[4750.34s -> 4753.62s]  Whatever item this is like rarity or quality, like just quality.
[4754.34s -> 4757.22s]  Just like whatever it is like an opinion.
[4757.22s -> 4758.02s]  Mine's way better.
[4758.02s -> 4758.58s]  Mine.
[4758.58s -> 4759.14s]  No, it's not.
[4759.70s -> 4761.54s]  I just got Flame of the Fel God.
[4763.43s -> 4764.31s]  Legendary spell.
[4766.01s -> 4769.13s]  I got the remembrance of a fucking Godwin.
[4769.85s -> 4777.59s]  I kind of want to just do like 90 faith and just do all these wacky ass spells.
[4785.66s -> 4788.06s]  I think that still fits with me strong character arc.
[4788.06s -> 4791.26s]  If he just throws like raging fireballs, you know what I mean?
[4791.26s -> 4792.54s]  He's just like angry.
[4792.54s -> 4793.74s]  Me rage.
[4793.74s -> 4794.86s]  There's a dragon in here.
[4796.06s -> 4798.06s]  No, what dragon is it?
[4800.94s -> 4801.26s]  Red.
[4803.50s -> 4803.82s]  Red.
[4804.38s -> 4805.91s]  It's a red dragon, man.
[4807.99s -> 4809.19s]  It's the lich dragon.
[4811.22s -> 4812.26s]  What the fuck?
[4812.82s -> 4814.02s]  I don't know what that is.
[4814.02s -> 4814.90s]  Neither do I.
[4814.90s -> 4817.78s]  I feel like I said it with a lot of with nervousness.
[4818.42s -> 4820.26s]  Oh, for the sacks.
[4820.26s -> 4821.30s]  First Elden Lord.
[4828.54s -> 4839.05s]  Oh, he has that.
[4839.05s -> 4839.69s]  I've never had.
[4839.69s -> 4842.65s]  I've never done this fight because I've never played this game before.
[4842.65s -> 4844.09s]  This is my first time playing Elden Ring.
[4844.09s -> 4845.37s]  Why would they put a dragon in this room?
[4845.37s -> 4846.81s]  Miyazaki, you're fucking wild.
[4846.81s -> 4847.21s]  I don't know.
[4849.21s -> 4850.81s]  It's actually not that big of a deal.
[4851.45s -> 4853.21s]  It's like, okay, as long as it doesn't do anything else.
[4854.01s -> 4861.42s]  There's just kind of shit everywhere, though.
[4862.14s -> 4870.14s]  Oh, God.
[4870.70s -> 4871.50s]  Oh, God.
[4872.38s -> 4884.46s]  It's really it's just kind of a mess.
[4884.46s -> 4886.62s]  But as long as we it's not killing us too hard.
[4889.29s -> 4890.17s]  That's a lot of damage.
[4895.69s -> 4897.69s]  Um, it's on the top row.
[4899.96s -> 4901.00s]  Off the top rope.
[4902.49s -> 4903.77s]  The Huracan Arana.
[4903.77s -> 4906.09s]  He's got like, oh, shit, the music is playing.
[4906.09s -> 4906.89s]  I'm going to get down there.
[4908.10s -> 4909.78s]  No, my big entrance.
[4911.21s -> 4912.41s]  They're going to think I'm such a dork.
[4913.21s -> 4919.98s]  Get down here.
[4920.62s -> 4927.70s]  This dragon sucks at this game.
[4934.73s -> 4936.73s]  We got to like, get in there and get some hits in.
[4937.45s -> 4957.30s]  Okay, he's in the dome.
[4957.86s -> 4967.59s]  Oh, that he just hit his neck on the top.
[4967.59s -> 4973.48s]  You just went like, that probably hurts so bad.
[4973.48s -> 4976.04s]  He is he is doing a good job hiding how bad that hurt.
[4977.08s -> 4979.45s]  Y'all just keep fighting like it's normal.
[4979.45s -> 4982.09s]  That's like a oh, dude, are you all right, man?
[4983.53s -> 4984.09s]  Yeah, I'm okay.
[4984.09s -> 4984.97s]  I'm all right.
[4984.97s -> 4985.29s]  I don't know.
[4985.29s -> 4986.41s]  That looks really bad.
[4986.41s -> 4986.81s]  No, I'm good.
[4986.81s -> 4987.13s]  I'm good.
[4987.13s -> 4988.01s]  I'm good.
[4988.01s -> 4990.57s]  It's like we do you want to go to like a doctor or something?
[4993.96s -> 5007.91s]  It's so hard to see right now.
[5009.03s -> 5010.95s]  He is having the reverse problem that we have.
[5011.67s -> 5013.67s]  He is complaining on his stream right now.
[5014.31s -> 5015.43s]  It's so fucking stupid.
[5015.43s -> 5016.55s]  How am I supposed to fight these cases?
[5016.55s -> 5018.39s]  Little these little ants in this room.
[5018.39s -> 5019.59s]  I can't even fit in here.
[5020.31s -> 5022.07s]  This randomizer is so bad.
[5022.87s -> 5024.78s]  How are you expected to actually do this?
[5025.58s -> 5028.94s]  Look, I can't even fit up here.
[5028.94s -> 5030.38s]  Fucking game is so stupid.
[5031.34s -> 5037.19s]  Actually, I heard a lot.
[5041.34s -> 5051.53s]  I mean, I'm concerned for my life, but I think you got him.
[5052.89s -> 5053.93s]  Kind of got me in the corner.
[5054.41s -> 5058.23s]  He's dead in three, two, one.
[5060.34s -> 5061.14s]  Got it.
[5061.14s -> 5064.82s]  Sacred tear.
[5064.82s -> 5065.30s]  Finally.
[5065.86s -> 5066.90s]  I've been needing one.
[5068.14s -> 5071.85s]  Oh, Bordasax just went offline.
[5071.85s -> 5073.53s]  Is his offline screens up?
[5074.50s -> 5077.75s]  Oh, he'll be back.
[5077.75s -> 5081.43s]  Can somebody go into his chat and just be like, I don't know.
[5081.43s -> 5083.64s]  We were just like fucking around.
[5083.64s -> 5088.98s]  I kind of feel bad though, because he was he's probably pissed.
[5088.98s -> 5089.38s]  Hold on.
[5089.38s -> 5091.46s]  I'll see if he's I'm in his discord.
[5091.46s -> 5093.48s]  I'm going to say like get owned in his discord.
[5093.48s -> 5095.16s]  Don't don't be an idiot.
[5104.22s -> 5105.50s]  I got 100,000 souls.
[5105.50s -> 5106.38s]  Hold on.
[5106.38s -> 5109.78s]  Wait, you level in this game?
[5113.42s -> 5114.78s]  I totally was just walking away.
[5115.42s -> 5117.58s]  I feel like I'm just going endurance, whatever.
[5118.46s -> 5121.18s]  You know, in like the hour that we've not been fighting millennia,
[5121.18s -> 5123.82s]  I have actually leveled like six or seven times.
[5126.15s -> 5127.51s]  You have not?
[5128.31s -> 5130.79s]  No, I've leveled like eight times.
[5130.79s -> 5134.15s]  All we had to do is like not fight millennia for like a little bit.
[5134.15s -> 5134.47s]  I know.
[5135.48s -> 5138.60s]  I'm so glad that after that first attempt that I just started,
[5138.60s -> 5140.68s]  you could just tell I was already annoyed.
[5140.68s -> 5143.93s]  I think it was already it was already going poorly.
[5143.93s -> 5147.16s]  And I'm so glad we just pulled the plug.
[5147.16s -> 5148.04s]  Get in the bowl.
[5148.04s -> 5158.31s]  They're not that Fortisax is going to open my stream
[5158.31s -> 5160.87s]  and he's going to think we're like beaming him by like jumping around and shit.
[5161.86s -> 5163.94s]  Okay, just play it like just play normally.
[5163.94s -> 5166.66s]  Don't like if he's watching, I don't want to be like, I don't know.
[5166.66s -> 5168.02s]  He's fucking huge, man.
[5168.02s -> 5172.26s]  I mean, if if someone like I don't even this scenario, this joke is weird.
[5172.26s -> 5175.38s]  But if someone beat you so bad that you turned off your stream,
[5175.38s -> 5178.58s]  would you sit there seizing in anger, open up their stream?
[5179.30s -> 5181.46s]  Like like, fuck this, I'm done.
[5181.46s -> 5184.78s]  And then then like watch their stream.
[5184.78s -> 5185.34s]  You know what?
[5185.34s -> 5188.55s]  Probably what you okay.
[5188.55s -> 5191.43s]  Look, if you were like fighting and you knew it was like two other streamers
[5191.43s -> 5194.55s]  and they were like, oh, yeah, Fortisax, we fucking got your ass.
[5194.55s -> 5195.35s]  You know what I mean?
[5195.35s -> 5196.15s]  You don't think you'd wait.
[5196.15s -> 5198.54s]  You'd watch me like, what the fuck are they saying now?
[5198.54s -> 5199.90s]  If what are they saying now?
[5199.90s -> 5202.71s]  Defeat it that you turn off your own stream.
[5202.71s -> 5204.31s]  I feel like you need to get out of the room.
[5204.31s -> 5205.99s]  Like you've already lost.
[5205.99s -> 5206.95s]  Yeah, you've already lost.
[5217.13s -> 5221.61s]  Do you want more memory slots?
[5221.61s -> 5222.65s]  Do I?
[5222.65s -> 5223.29s]  Yes.
[5223.29s -> 5224.57s]  Do you want like more spell slots?
[5224.57s -> 5227.37s]  I know you keep saying I don't use spells.
[5227.37s -> 5228.73s]  No, I'm good.
[5229.86s -> 5231.38s]  I don't know what happened on my memory slots.
[5231.38s -> 5233.78s]  I think when I respect, I lost a lot of them
[5233.78s -> 5236.41s]  because I had like two full rows.
[5236.41s -> 5237.77s]  I kept getting them.
[5237.77s -> 5242.65s]  But now I've got like five slots.
[5242.65s -> 5244.33s]  Oh, dude, Fortisax raid.
[5244.97s -> 5245.61s]  Seven.
[5245.61s -> 5248.31s]  What's up Fortisax?
[5248.31s -> 5248.87s]  Thanks for the raid.
[5248.87s -> 5250.31s]  I mean, I know what you were just doing.
[5251.59s -> 5252.47s]  Appreciate the raid though.
[5256.02s -> 5257.14s]  Okay, let's go.
[5257.14s -> 5262.39s]  Boss, ignore Fortisax.
[5263.03s -> 5272.28s]  All right, so what's in here besides Bogot?
[5272.28s -> 5272.68s]  I see.
[5273.48s -> 5275.32s]  You know what's in there?
[5275.32s -> 5276.12s]  I know it's in there
[5276.12s -> 5278.76s]  and you're going to want to equip your Rikard bike.
[5279.40s -> 5281.88s]  My Rikard bike?
[5282.60s -> 5284.76s]  The pike, the spear that he gives you.
[5284.76s -> 5291.08s]  Oh, does that mean that Rikard is in here?
[5291.72s -> 5291.96s]  Yeah.
[5292.52s -> 5293.08s]  Okay.
[5293.08s -> 5294.36s]  I think it only worked for one of us.
[5294.36s -> 5295.16s]  So you go in first.
[5301.43s -> 5302.95s]  It appears to be his stage two.
[5302.95s -> 5303.99s]  It's stage two.
[5303.99s -> 5313.00s]  Wait a minute.
[5313.00s -> 5314.28s]  Ah, it's the regular cutscene.
[5315.42s -> 5316.97s]  Lame.
[5316.97s -> 5318.81s]  I just want to hear him say together.
[5319.93s -> 5322.01s]  Oh, this is a small arena for him.
[5322.01s -> 5333.75s]  Yep, it is very easy.
[5334.63s -> 5336.84s]  I don't think I can help.
[5343.06s -> 5344.34s]  I need we do this again.
[5344.34s -> 5345.94s]  I'm going to have to do more man of flasks.
[5346.58s -> 5348.76s]  What is happening?
[5349.48s -> 5352.74s]  I don't know.
[5352.74s -> 5353.46s]  He's swinging at me.
[5354.26s -> 5355.98s]  Shit.
[5355.98s -> 5356.38s]  Rones.
[5358.55s -> 5359.43s]  Wait, what?
[5359.43s -> 5361.43s]  Oh, it's Morgoth talking.
[5362.94s -> 5365.42s]  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[5365.42s -> 5367.26s]  It's like Morgoth went to phase two.
[5368.86s -> 5373.14s]  What's that?
[5373.14s -> 5374.18s]  Is there a car driving?
[5375.91s -> 5376.63s]  Yes.
[5376.63s -> 5377.35s]  What is that?
[5377.35s -> 5378.55s]  Was there a car?
[5378.55s -> 5379.83s]  There's a motorbike on the highway.
[5381.03s -> 5381.35s]  Wait, no.
[5381.35s -> 5382.63s]  Is that from your room?
[5384.17s -> 5384.41s]  No.
[5385.35s -> 5386.55s]  What the hell was that?
[5386.55s -> 5387.43s]  That was in the game?
[5387.43s -> 5388.55s]  No, it was not.
[5388.55s -> 5389.27s]  Yes, it was.
[5392.06s -> 5392.70s]  I'm going to die.
[5408.41s -> 5408.97s]  Oh, fuck.
[5409.69s -> 5410.73s]  Oh, wait.
[5410.73s -> 5411.29s]  He does this thing.
[5412.01s -> 5417.82s]  All right.
[5417.82s -> 5419.98s]  He's dead in three, two, one.
[5419.98s -> 5421.19s]  Nice.
[5422.86s -> 5423.26s]  Yippee.
[5426.71s -> 5427.03s]  Yeah.
[5428.39s -> 5430.55s]  Two sacred tears and Godric's great run.
[5432.79s -> 5433.51s]  Oh, really?
[5434.73s -> 5435.53s]  Oh, really?
[5435.53s -> 5436.25s]  That's pretty sick.
[5436.81s -> 5437.53s]  That is sick.
[5438.41s -> 5442.81s]  When I was walking up to this for the first time
[5442.81s -> 5443.69s]  and just looking at this shit
[5444.41s -> 5446.33s]  and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going in the room.
[5446.33s -> 5446.81s]  It was like.
[5447.45s -> 5448.01s]  Jebaited.
[5448.73s -> 5452.86s]  I was like, oh, my God.
[5466.55s -> 5466.79s]  What?
[5468.07s -> 5468.31s]  What?
[5468.31s -> 5469.27s]  You can't get in the urn tree.
[5469.91s -> 5471.03s]  Oh, my God.
[5471.03s -> 5472.31s]  It would have been funny if this was DLC.
[5473.35s -> 5475.37s]  They just didn't do anything with it.
[5475.37s -> 5477.21s]  It was like that would not be funny.
[5477.53s -> 5480.65s]  That would be actually really infuriating.
[5486.62s -> 5487.74s]  And it's paid DLC.
[5495.03s -> 5495.35s]  Hello.
[5496.55s -> 5497.11s]  Old friend.
[5498.79s -> 5501.19s]  I got the animation like she appeared, but she's not here.
[5501.19s -> 5503.03s]  You probably I'll just stand up and do it.
[5510.89s -> 5514.55s]  Are we supposed to get something important here?
[5515.90s -> 5517.02s]  She gave me a cookbook.
[5518.44s -> 5518.92s]  I think.
[5519.72s -> 5521.94s]  Huh.
[5523.46s -> 5526.58s]  Isn't this where she tells you that like she wants to fucking smoke up?
[5529.42s -> 5531.34s]  It's the the medallion.
[5533.61s -> 5536.30s]  Oh, the medallion.
[5536.30s -> 5536.86s]  What do we do?
[5538.50s -> 5539.22s]  What medallion?
[5540.02s -> 5542.20s]  The rolled medallion to get up.
[5542.20s -> 5543.08s]  I have a full one.
[5543.08s -> 5543.72s]  You have it.
[5544.28s -> 5544.52s]  Yeah.
[5550.09s -> 5550.25s]  Yeah.
[5550.25s -> 5552.41s]  I got that like really early on on the first day.
[5552.41s -> 5553.69s]  I completed the whole medallion.
[5553.69s -> 5554.25s]  Thank goodness.
[5557.06s -> 5558.34s]  She gave me a member.
[5558.34s -> 5559.62s]  Everyone's giving me golden seeds.
[5560.18s -> 5560.90s]  She's like here.
[5560.90s -> 5561.70s]  I don't know.
[5561.70s -> 5562.10s]  All of it.
[5562.10s -> 5563.30s]  We all have plenty of these.
[5573.53s -> 5577.21s]  Can we go to God Rick's tower so I can get the great rune?
[5578.09s -> 5578.81s]  Yes.
[5578.81s -> 5584.49s]  I believe it is.
[5584.49s -> 5585.37s]  It must be this one.
[5586.17s -> 5590.52s]  It's the one in the castle is God Rick, right?
[5590.52s -> 5596.47s]  Why can't I travel not travel to a site of grace right now?
[5596.47s -> 5596.87s]  Why not?
[5601.46s -> 5601.86s]  If I can.
[5602.50s -> 5604.92s]  I don't know.
[5604.92s -> 5605.64s]  Why can I?
[5605.64s -> 5607.96s]  If it's multiple pieces, you have the wrong medallion.
[5617.16s -> 5618.52s]  Is it was it multiple pieces?
[5619.16s -> 5622.20s]  I'm not sure.
[5622.20s -> 5622.52s]  Hold on.
[5622.52s -> 5628.60s]  I'm looking what I have buried deep within my inventory.
[5636.95s -> 5639.51s]  World medallion operates the grand lift of rolled.
[5639.51s -> 5639.99s]  There you go.
[5641.86s -> 5645.54s]  I think I might have just thought it was two pieces because it is split in half.
[5645.54s -> 5646.66s]  Like the image of it.
[5646.66s -> 5650.17s]  I just destroyed it.
[5650.17s -> 5650.97s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[5650.97s -> 5651.69s]  I sit on it.
[5654.30s -> 5655.90s]  I think I just assumed it was pieces.
[5657.11s -> 5661.75s]  So I am you got to talk to the corpse.
[5662.76s -> 5663.64s]  I did.
[5663.64s -> 5664.84s]  But I can't go anywhere.
[5670.55s -> 5671.83s]  I have to check the thorns though.
[5675.48s -> 5677.48s]  Oh, did you not like talk to the thorns?
[5678.50s -> 5679.30s]  Maybe that's what it is.
[5680.55s -> 5681.59s]  Technically, I guess.
[5682.23s -> 5685.14s]  No, those thorns are lonely.
[5685.14s -> 5685.94s]  It's a known bug.
[5685.94s -> 5686.98s]  You have to you have to separate.
[5687.70s -> 5688.74s]  We have to separate.
[5690.28s -> 5691.40s]  I banish me.
[5692.12s -> 5692.92s]  Banish me now.
[5694.76s -> 5699.61s]  And hey, before you go, drop that larval tear on the ground.
[5699.61s -> 5728.25s]  If you would, you can come back to my world and get it.
[5728.25s -> 5731.93s]  If you fucking grovel a little bit, the game crashed.
[5731.93s -> 5732.97s]  I think it was.
[5732.97s -> 5734.89s]  I think my game was probably waiting to crash.
[5734.97s -> 5739.88s]  So it was just like, hold on, hold on momentarily.
[5739.88s -> 5741.64s]  I'm just going to walk up to the tower.
[5741.64s -> 5744.44s]  I don't know if you'd like you get items here too.
[5744.44s -> 5745.40s]  Or if you can even come.
[5749.03s -> 5750.63s]  Okay, he's going to go.
[5750.63s -> 5751.83s]  He's going to go pee.
[5751.83s -> 5754.58s]  Okay, you're definitely going to want to mute then
[5754.58s -> 5756.26s]  because I'm going to go off on a tangent.
[5831.96s -> 5834.52s]  I'm back to me is where he walks away to, you know,
[5834.52s -> 5836.20s]  just be as weird as possible.
[5836.20s -> 5837.24s]  I am.
[5837.24s -> 5837.56s]  I'm good.
[5837.56s -> 5838.68s]  I made sure to be very quick.
[5840.54s -> 5841.90s]  But wow, you can do that.
[5841.90s -> 5845.51s]  You can you sacrificed your bathroom time for me.
[5845.51s -> 5846.47s]  Well, I don't know.
[5846.47s -> 5850.15s]  I just we didn't stand up for eight hours yesterday.
[5850.15s -> 5852.79s]  And I kind of want to make sure every like couple hours,
[5852.79s -> 5853.51s]  like I get up.
[5854.55s -> 5861.56s]  That's valid and based.
[5862.12s -> 5862.44s]  Yeah.
[5862.44s -> 5862.76s]  All right.
[5868.82s -> 5870.02s]  Somebody says a crazy.
[5870.02s -> 5873.27s]  All right, so let me open my game again.
[5884.60s -> 5886.28s]  What's better, Bloodborne or Elden Ring?
[5887.77s -> 5891.45s]  Elden Ring is probably the best single player experience
[5891.45s -> 5893.61s]  I've probably had in a long time.
[5894.17s -> 5896.49s]  It's hard to compare them because they're almost what?
[5896.49s -> 5899.26s]  Almost full of 10 years apart.
[5899.26s -> 5903.67s]  It's difficult to say and it's hard to do that.
[5904.31s -> 5908.12s]  I think Elden Ring is I think Elden Ring is probably better,
[5908.12s -> 5910.76s]  but it's just newer and there's more shit in it.
[5910.76s -> 5911.50s]  It's hard to say.
[5912.62s -> 5913.74s]  My Dark Souls 2 argument.
[5913.74s -> 5916.89s]  There's just more shit.
[5916.89s -> 5923.11s]  It'd be nice if there was more Bloodborne.
[5923.11s -> 5927.10s]  Okay, I let me bring this back.
[5930.47s -> 5931.51s]  You should be able to see.
[5932.23s -> 5933.27s]  Yes, you can.
[5933.27s -> 5933.67s]  Okay.
[5933.67s -> 5934.79s]  All right.
[5934.79s -> 5935.27s]  Can you see?
[5937.38s -> 5939.22s]  All right, I'm going to.
[5939.22s -> 5940.26s]  Do you have your thing on?
[5942.42s -> 5942.90s]  Do I?
[5946.33s -> 5948.17s]  Maybe the 30 FPS cap.
[5948.17s -> 5956.63s]  Yeah, it's that's probably the only thing holding that back at this point.
[5956.63s -> 5961.26s]  I have a feeling deep in my soul,
[5961.26s -> 5962.62s]  even for reasons I've told you,
[5962.62s -> 5967.69s]  but can't say that they're waiting for something for Bloodborne.
[5968.57s -> 5971.85s]  Like like some like Demon's Souls remaster treatment or something.
[5972.65s -> 5975.53s]  If they do, if they did the Demon's Souls remake,
[5975.53s -> 5978.33s]  you have to assume that Bloodborne will get maybe.
[5978.33s -> 5978.81s]  I don't know.
[5978.81s -> 5981.59s]  I feel like is it one of those scenarios where
[5981.59s -> 5983.75s]  like they coded it to a point where it's like,
[5983.75s -> 5986.07s]  well, we kind of can't do anything about this.
[5986.07s -> 5988.79s]  It's just this is the game.
[5988.79s -> 5989.51s]  I doubt it.
[5989.51s -> 5992.63s]  When Demon's Souls got like how good that remaster is
[5992.63s -> 5993.91s]  and how old Demon's Souls is.
[5993.91s -> 5995.83s]  But Demon's the Demon's Souls remaster
[5995.83s -> 5999.35s]  was like a complete 100% remake of the entire game.
[5999.35s -> 6002.23s]  It wasn't like a HD texture pack.
[6002.23s -> 6004.87s]  I never got to play it because I don't have a PS5.
[6004.87s -> 6005.83s]  I neither.
[6005.83s -> 6009.91s]  But that was a it was a complete they made the whole game over again.
[6009.91s -> 6018.95s]  So it's not like a Dark Souls remastered kind of scenario.
[6018.95s -> 6020.47s]  I sure you know what?
[6021.03s -> 6026.06s]  When I'm 80 years old and all the lawsuits have caught up with me
[6026.06s -> 6027.10s]  and I'm on my deathbed,
[6027.10s -> 6028.86s]  I really hope there's more Bloodborne content.
[6030.71s -> 6033.91s]  You're just riddled in lawsuits and you're 80.
[6040.01s -> 6041.93s]  Isn't there somebody on this bridge usually?
[6042.89s -> 6047.66s]  Two giants and at the end of this bridge.
[6047.66s -> 6050.14s]  No, it's just a really, really long bridge.
[6050.14s -> 6070.62s]  I will go down and say the old hunters is the best DLC
[6070.62s -> 6071.66s]  in any from software game.
[6075.83s -> 6076.31s]  Okay.
[6076.31s -> 6076.79s]  Yeah.
[6076.79s -> 6077.03s]  Yeah.
[6077.59s -> 6077.83s]  Yeah.
[6077.83s -> 6079.82s]  Yeah.
[6079.82s -> 6080.14s]  Yeah.
[6080.14s -> 6080.38s]  Yeah.
[6080.38s -> 6080.86s]  Sure.
[6080.86s -> 6081.10s]  Yeah.
[6081.10s -> 6081.42s]  All right.
[6081.42s -> 6081.74s]  Okay.
[6082.30s -> 6089.94s]  Isn't there some weird stuff with one of these?
[6090.58s -> 6092.10s]  You go there's a boss like in this.
[6092.10s -> 6093.62s]  You go all the way down or something.
[6093.62s -> 6093.86s]  Yeah.
[6093.86s -> 6096.10s]  You like you travel across one of the bridges
[6096.10s -> 6097.62s]  and your whole screen turns black
[6097.62s -> 6099.30s]  and you fight like two of the Omen people.
[6100.65s -> 6102.01s]  That is what happens.
[6102.01s -> 6102.49s]  Right.
[6102.49s -> 6102.73s]  Okay.
[6103.37s -> 6111.77s]  The ring city was pretty good.
[6114.62s -> 6114.94s]  Yeah.
[6114.94s -> 6116.62s]  But I think as a whole.
[6116.62s -> 6116.94s]  Okay.
[6116.94s -> 6119.18s]  Wait, what's the the Bloodborne boss's name
[6119.18s -> 6119.98s]  in the clock tower?
[6126.46s -> 6128.46s]  You know, you know the one Maria.
[6128.46s -> 6128.70s]  Yeah.
[6128.70s -> 6132.54s]  Maria is if like millennia wasn't dog shit.
[6132.54s -> 6136.73s]  It's like they wanted to do Maria again
[6136.73s -> 6138.33s]  because people really liked her
[6138.33s -> 6139.37s]  and then they put her in a game
[6139.37s -> 6141.13s]  where you can't actually dodge that quickly.
[6153.59s -> 6153.91s]  Okay.
[6153.91s -> 6154.55s]  Real question.
[6155.27s -> 6157.27s]  Real question before I restore the power of the great run.
[6157.27s -> 6157.51s]  Yes.
[6158.15s -> 6159.83s]  You're in the Elden Ring universe
[6159.83s -> 6161.19s]  and you come up here in the two fingers here
[6161.19s -> 6162.39s]  and it's this holy dude.
[6162.39s -> 6163.75s]  Look how holy this shit is.
[6163.75s -> 6166.63s]  You think you would take a bite?
[6166.63s -> 6168.39s]  No, because that would be disrespecting
[6168.39s -> 6169.59s]  this holy thing
[6169.59s -> 6171.03s]  and that would be a complete disrespect
[6171.03s -> 6173.75s]  that it would be what do you think you're doing?
[6173.75s -> 6176.15s]  You see you see like the the ripped up.
[6176.15s -> 6180.10s]  It's kind of like it's kind of like bark like tree.
[6180.10s -> 6181.22s]  Get it tree fingers.
[6183.88s -> 6184.36s]  Hold on.
[6184.36s -> 6186.28s]  Honestly, like I think you just kind of
[6186.28s -> 6188.18s]  said something really profound.
[6188.18s -> 6188.98s]  Hold on.
[6188.98s -> 6191.69s]  It is like tree.
[6191.69s -> 6192.73s]  It is like a tree bark.
[6192.73s -> 6202.06s]  Yeah, tree fingers.
[6202.14s -> 6202.78s]  It's a tree.
[6209.46s -> 6216.57s]  Get fatty on the phone immediately.
[6216.57s -> 6217.37s]  Okay, where are we going?
[6223.35s -> 6225.58s]  We can go.
[6226.22s -> 6233.48s]  So we you have the medallion.
[6233.48s -> 6234.81s]  Here are your options.
[6234.81s -> 6235.69s]  Medallion of rolled.
[6235.69s -> 6236.25s]  Yeah.
[6236.25s -> 6240.52s]  We can do the weird upside down area.
[6240.52s -> 6240.92s]  Okay.
[6240.92s -> 6242.60s]  With you know you I have that item.
[6242.60s -> 6247.26s]  We can put the time thing and it goes upside down.
[6247.26s -> 6247.98s]  You can do that.
[6247.98s -> 6248.22s]  Yes.
[6248.78s -> 6249.93s]  Yes.
[6249.93s -> 6251.69s]  We could we could go in.
[6251.69s -> 6252.65s]  I want to hear option two.
[6252.65s -> 6254.09s]  We could go in and and fight.
[6255.29s -> 6256.01s]  You know what I mean?
[6256.01s -> 6256.57s]  We could do that.
[6257.05s -> 6260.42s]  But I mean that that's a possibility.
[6260.42s -> 6262.90s]  We could go do the medallion.
[6262.90s -> 6268.18s]  Or we can go to the upside down.
[6268.18s -> 6275.50s]  Medallion upside down world or and we're not doing that one because it's not.
[6275.50s -> 6278.34s]  Okay, upside down vote.
[6278.34s -> 6279.62s]  My vote has been in.
[6279.62s -> 6281.48s]  You're voting for upside down world.
[6281.48s -> 6283.98s]  Yeah.
[6283.98s -> 6291.62s]  Okay, so then we have to go to lake facing cliffs and go from there, right?
[6291.62s -> 6294.23s]  I think pretty far ride.
[6294.23s -> 6297.02s]  That's a pretty far ride.
[6297.02s -> 6300.46s]  Oh, we could go down into the shining grounds sewers.
[6300.46s -> 6302.63s]  That's where Mog is.
[6302.63s -> 6310.94s]  That's great for Mog.
[6310.94s -> 6313.26s]  Isn't there a place further up where we can?
[6313.82s -> 6314.62s]  That's a fake Mog.
[6314.62s -> 6317.61s]  But yeah, what's your question?
[6317.61s -> 6321.40s]  I don't know if we have to go this far back.
[6324.41s -> 6324.89s]  I don't know.
[6324.89s -> 6325.61s]  I'm going to follow you.
[6327.75s -> 6330.02s]  Take the wheels.
[6330.02s -> 6333.94s]  Somebody's name is gaming dragon Fortisacs.
[6333.94s -> 6340.54s]  I think they're trying to tap into that market there.
[6341.18s -> 6343.08s]  All right.
[6343.08s -> 6345.32s]  So we need to find a way to go like here.
[6345.32s -> 6348.18s]  I don't know about you, but I have a lot of Fortisacs.
[6348.18s -> 6356.12s]  Trying to figure out what you are saying right now.
[6356.12s -> 6361.82s]  We need to go down that way.
[6361.82s -> 6364.78s]  What does he mean?
[6364.78s -> 6365.58s]  What do you mean?
[6365.58s -> 6367.10s]  No, don't even explain it.
[6367.10s -> 6369.32s]  You gotta be honest.
[6369.32s -> 6370.28s]  I don't really know.
[6370.28s -> 6372.12s]  I think it's open to interpretation.
[6373.37s -> 6374.17s]  Did I go the wrong?
[6374.17s -> 6375.69s]  Like, we're not supposed to go this way.
[6375.69s -> 6378.97s]  I'm trying to find like we need to go down there.
[6378.97s -> 6380.38s]  How do you get down there?
[6382.38s -> 6383.74s]  The edge of the cliff that way.
[6383.74s -> 6387.42s]  There's a whole bunch of those things on the wall that you can jump down.
[6388.06s -> 6388.54s]  Is there?
[6389.26s -> 6391.98s]  Yeah, there's some cliff side of wall jumps there.
[6392.62s -> 6392.94s]  Yes.
[6394.68s -> 6395.24s]  God.
[6395.24s -> 6395.64s]  Listen.
[6396.87s -> 6397.51s]  Listen.
[6397.51s -> 6398.31s]  They won't.
[6398.31s -> 6399.35s]  They won't leave me alone.
[6399.91s -> 6405.37s]  So am I going the wrong way or are you going the wrong way?
[6405.37s -> 6407.40s]  I don't even know where you're going.
[6407.96s -> 6412.76s]  I'm trying to go down here like to get to where.
[6412.76s -> 6415.48s]  Well, I mean, like I would we go this far apart?
[6415.48s -> 6416.44s]  We do think so much.
[6416.44s -> 6417.88s]  I don't know where you actually are.
[6418.44s -> 6418.68s]  All right.
[6418.68s -> 6420.52s]  We need to just get back together again.
[6420.52s -> 6424.70s]  Helen, we just you've gone too far.
[6424.70s -> 6425.10s]  I'm coming.
[6425.10s -> 6425.50s]  I'm coming.
[6426.46s -> 6428.14s]  I thought there was a different way to get down here.
[6428.86s -> 6429.34s]  Coming back.
[6429.98s -> 6430.86s]  You've gone too far.
[6430.86s -> 6438.98s]  It's these like sideways tombstones right here.
[6449.13s -> 6452.54s]  I wanted you to think I was jumping off.
[6454.07s -> 6454.95s]  Well, that's what you got to do.
[6457.02s -> 6457.74s]  I freaked out.
[6461.86s -> 6462.50s]  Nice joke.
[6463.22s -> 6463.86s]  I freaked.
[6463.86s -> 6465.94s]  I didn't I knew I wasn't going to make the second jump.
[6465.94s -> 6468.12s]  And I was like, fuck, I have to double jump.
[6468.12s -> 6471.00s]  But I don't want to double jump too far because I'll go over the tombstone.
[6471.00s -> 6472.68s]  I've done enough of those jokes today.
[6472.68s -> 6473.18s]  No.
[6483.32s -> 6484.36s]  Well, we can work.
[6484.36s -> 6488.20s]  There's a bonfire here if you can't handle those jumps.
[6488.20s -> 6488.70s]  I can.
[6489.72s -> 6494.54s]  I don't know.
[6494.54s -> 6495.02s]  I don't know.
[6495.02s -> 6496.38s]  I don't know if you're going to handle these jumps.
[6496.94s -> 6500.48s]  Well, I just did something to say.
[6503.64s -> 6504.12s]  King me.
[6504.76s -> 6511.55s]  OK, so there's actually a lot of random shit we could do here.
[6511.55s -> 6512.89s]  We could do this.
[6512.89s -> 6514.89s]  I think there's probably there's a jail here, too, isn't there?
[6514.89s -> 6515.39s]  Yes.
[6515.85s -> 6519.13s]  Do you know what's crazy about our playthrough is that this game is so giant.
[6519.13s -> 6521.37s]  We keep talking about how giant and big this game is.
[6522.17s -> 6525.61s]  And then it was also like, no, the only thing we get.
[6525.61s -> 6527.29s]  The only thing we can do is millennia.
[6527.29s -> 6531.93s]  Well, we didn't have the key to the manor.
[6531.93s -> 6533.45s]  We didn't have the two great ruins.
[6533.45s -> 6536.65s]  We kind of we could go this whole like this whole side path.
[6536.65s -> 6537.77s]  We didn't do any of this.
[6537.77s -> 6539.69s]  Yeah, but but game progress.
[6539.69s -> 6543.45s]  We were just beating our head against the wall trying to do game progress.
[6543.45s -> 6544.25s]  I don't know.
[6544.25s -> 6545.93s]  We made a lot of progress and we haven't killed her yet.
[6546.81s -> 6549.93s]  Yeah, because we came progress because we got the two items.
[6549.93s -> 6551.69s]  We needed to keep game progress going.
[6552.57s -> 6556.38s]  I don't know why you were convinced that millennia had those two items.
[6556.38s -> 6561.40s]  No, it's true.
[6563.52s -> 6564.16s]  Sensor him.
[6567.21s -> 6567.69s]  Oh, fun.
[6567.69s -> 6567.93s]  Enemy.
[6567.93s -> 6568.09s]  Fun.
[6568.09s -> 6568.41s]  Enemy.
[6571.53s -> 6572.49s]  Dung eater puppet.
[6574.97s -> 6575.93s]  One hit.
[6575.93s -> 6590.59s]  OK, so let's check out this.
[6590.59s -> 6594.11s]  There's a down by me left.
[6594.67s -> 6595.79s]  There's some ruins.
[6595.79s -> 6599.23s]  They might be a boss down underground in the purified ruins.
[6599.87s -> 6601.96s]  Just grab in the moon fire.
[6601.96s -> 6603.56s]  There's a legendary item here for me.
[6605.21s -> 6605.77s]  Not for you.
[6605.77s -> 6608.25s]  The teleporter in the chest up here in that tower.
[6608.25s -> 6609.37s]  I don't remember where that takes you.
[6610.25s -> 6612.06s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[6612.70s -> 6613.18s]  I think so.
[6617.48s -> 6618.28s]  That's good.
[6618.28s -> 6621.08s]  I actually don't have to have two acts of Godfrey's now.
[6623.16s -> 6623.40s]  No.
[6624.04s -> 6633.12s]  Oh, yes, I look over at chat when I pick up a legendary item
[6633.12s -> 6636.16s]  to see how many fog champs there are to determine if I'm going to say,
[6636.16s -> 6637.52s]  whoa, what the fuck is awesome?
[6644.83s -> 6651.04s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[6651.04s -> 6652.24s]  Margaret's shackle.
[6652.24s -> 6656.36s]  What the hell is that at Margaret or Morgoth's fight?
[6656.36s -> 6660.12s]  If you use that item, it'll make Morgoth go.
[6660.52s -> 6662.52s]  He'll slam into the ground for like five seconds.
[6663.16s -> 6665.72s]  Oh, so it's like in a Yasha when you say, sit, boy.
[6666.92s -> 6679.58s]  Make it rain.
[6680.96s -> 6684.14s]  The answer to that is yes, I think.
[6685.37s -> 6689.85s]  So do you think that that implies in the lore that Margaret is actually Isiakide?
[6691.04s -> 6692.64s]  I think, I think.
[6692.64s -> 6694.78s]  He's not, he's not from here.
[6694.78s -> 6695.90s]  Oh, okay.
[6695.90s -> 6696.30s]  All right.
[6705.90s -> 6706.86s]  I'm killing this.
[6706.86s -> 6707.34s]  I hate her.
[6712.80s -> 6713.30s]  Oh.
[6715.71s -> 6721.08s]  Oh, no.
[6721.08s -> 6724.08s]  Can't lock on to her.
[6733.39s -> 6735.87s]  Okay, now we're going to go over here.
[6737.93s -> 6739.45s]  Is something else for us to look at?
[6760.32s -> 6762.64s]  What is over here?
[6766.49s -> 6768.89s]  That's just, I can't get out of my head now.
[6768.89s -> 6770.17s]  I just keep thinking about it.
[6770.81s -> 6772.30s]  Isn't there something here?
[6773.18s -> 6774.86s]  I'm really busting the lore down.
[6775.66s -> 6780.09s]  I just see it from a different angle.
[6782.35s -> 6783.23s]  What else is here?
[6783.79s -> 6787.16s]  Irma, why do you look like that?
[6787.88s -> 6793.24s]  You know, people, people ask that and it's just like, I don't know, dude,
[6795.80s -> 6800.76s]  my skin and muscle and sinew up here formed a person's face.
[6803.00s -> 6803.48s]  I don't know.
[6808.44s -> 6810.12s]  Sounds like something an alien would say.
[6812.62s -> 6813.12s]  Bro.
[6815.68s -> 6816.80s]  We got the Mariner.
[6816.80s -> 6818.08s]  It's the Crucible Knight down here.
[6819.60s -> 6824.62s]  What are the Mariners usually drop that you need?
[6824.62s -> 6825.50s]  What's their thing?
[6825.50s -> 6826.22s]  Deathroot, I think.
[6826.94s -> 6830.70s]  I think they're one of the sources of Deathroot.
[6831.26s -> 6833.32s]  Sounds right, dude.
[6836.60s -> 6838.36s]  Dude, screw you.
[6838.36s -> 6839.32s]  You stink at this game.
[6840.84s -> 6841.48s]  Distractive.
[6842.04s -> 6843.00s]  He is distracted.
[6843.88s -> 6857.04s]  Why is my weapon not equipped?
[6870.68s -> 6871.88s]  What a great enemy.
[6873.24s -> 6874.52s]  Three lumps of flesh.
[6874.52s -> 6875.40s]  Let's fucking go.
[6882.78s -> 6883.58s]  Larval tear.
[6885.12s -> 6885.60s]  Oh, cool.
[6885.60s -> 6886.96s]  You don't need mine anymore.
[6886.96s -> 6887.68s]  You mooch.
[6893.64s -> 6894.60s]  Are you feeling okay?
[6895.40s -> 6895.64s]  Yes.
[6899.10s -> 6899.90s]  I thought of you today.
[6899.90s -> 6900.86s]  Spiked practice.
[6903.02s -> 6907.42s]  In my Uber, the song What If God Was One Of Us was playing.
[6909.26s -> 6913.74s]  And I never heard this lyric before, but it says a slob like one of us.
[6914.54s -> 6915.50s]  Yeah, it's.
[6915.50s -> 6917.98s]  What if God was one of us?
[6918.70s -> 6921.34s]  Just a slob like one of us.
[6922.06s -> 6923.90s]  I got the letter from Volcano Manor.
[6923.90s -> 6925.66s]  I don't know if that was something we needed.
[6925.66s -> 6928.64s]  I don't think so.
[6928.64s -> 6935.39s]  I have enough to level up, I think.
[6935.95s -> 6939.44s]  I need one of those.
[6939.44s -> 6941.52s]  I need to go back, look at remembrances,
[6941.52s -> 6944.44s]  and I got to make a lot of decisions.
[6945.77s -> 6951.12s]  Did you ever talk to the finger maiden next to the two fingers?
[6951.12s -> 6951.76s]  Yes.
[6951.76s -> 6954.11s]  Okay, because she does sell a bunch of stuff.
[6954.11s -> 6954.99s]  Yes, she does.
[6954.99s -> 6956.75s]  She sold some pretty good things to me.
[6960.14s -> 6961.58s]  I kind of want to go to the upside down.
[6962.38s -> 6962.62s]  Yeah.
[6963.42s -> 6964.38s]  No, I'm going to disconnect you.
[6964.38s -> 6965.26s]  I'm going to go get the waypoint.
[6965.26s -> 6966.06s]  You go do your thing.
[6966.06s -> 6966.86s]  All right, all right.
[6966.86s -> 6969.82s]  Just boot me because I've got a major decision I have to make here.
[6969.82s -> 6970.86s]  I have banished you.
[6970.86s -> 6971.74s]  I'll see you in an hour.
[6972.94s -> 6974.33s]  Chat.
[6974.33s -> 6974.97s]  I can't see.
[6976.43s -> 6978.43s]  I don't know why I'm doing that today.
[6978.43s -> 6978.99s]  I don't know.
[6978.99s -> 6979.79s]  I don't know.
[6979.79s -> 6987.10s]  But anyways, I'm going to make this decision one more time.
[6987.10s -> 6992.00s]  I need to have the final build.
[6992.00s -> 6995.15s]  And I genuinely don't know what that is.
[6995.15s -> 6997.87s]  I could dual weld the omen cleavers.
[6999.12s -> 7000.32s]  God damn it.
[7000.32s -> 7001.60s]  You know what?
[7001.60s -> 7002.96s]  I'm just to make him feel better.
[7003.92s -> 7004.88s]  Just hit me a few times.
[7008.28s -> 7008.92s]  Oh, man.
[7009.80s -> 7010.36s]  Almost got me.
[7012.28s -> 7013.72s]  Oh, I did a lot of damage, but sorry.
[7013.72s -> 7014.36s]  You're doing good, though.
[7014.36s -> 7015.00s]  You're doing pretty good.
[7015.72s -> 7017.23s]  Watch it.
[7019.21s -> 7021.05s]  Oh, how'd you do that move?
[7021.77s -> 7024.08s]  You're pretty good at this game.
[7031.61s -> 7031.93s]  All right.
[7031.93s -> 7033.69s]  There's no more no more jokes.
[7033.69s -> 7034.57s]  No more joking around.
[7035.37s -> 7039.64s]  No more jokes.
[7039.64s -> 7040.52s]  You got to pick your belt.
[7040.52s -> 7042.84s]  You got to pick your belt and see if you're going to dual weld.
[7053.92s -> 7057.53s]  Two big hands jumping claw attacks.
[7057.53s -> 7059.45s]  I know it's really pretty good.
[7059.45s -> 7060.57s]  It's really good.
[7060.57s -> 7065.21s]  But are you a big enough man to do it?
[7065.21s -> 7065.93s]  That's the question.
[7065.93s -> 7067.69s]  The question is, what am I going to do?
[7068.65s -> 7073.40s]  Are you thick enough and tight enough?
[7078.16s -> 7078.64s]  I missed it.
[7081.42s -> 7081.98s]  Missed it.
[7081.98s -> 7082.62s]  All right.
[7086.65s -> 7087.85s]  What a shitty thing.
[7088.57s -> 7088.89s]  What?
[7090.72s -> 7097.72s]  Oh, you're going to have a recusant finger or a gold scarab.
[7097.72s -> 7102.68s]  I don't know what you're doing, but it doesn't sound like you're respecting.
[7103.40s -> 7106.28s]  I'm I took I have a remembrance and I'm just checking to see what they are.
[7106.28s -> 7109.24s]  And it's not remembrance weapon randomization.
[7109.24s -> 7111.00s]  It's any item randomization.
[7111.56s -> 7112.12s]  Yeah.
[7112.12s -> 7119.16s]  The gold scarab, though, is this something that is I feel like that.
[7119.16s -> 7120.28s]  How good is that?
[7120.28s -> 7122.35s]  I should just take the scarab.
[7122.35s -> 7127.93s]  But it's a talisman, right?
[7127.93s -> 7129.45s]  It's 20% more.
[7135.63s -> 7140.19s]  Is it more or additional because the more multipliers and not, you know what I'm saying?
[7140.19s -> 7148.38s]  Holy shit.
[7148.38s -> 7154.46s]  Somebody just called you a POE player.
[7155.34s -> 7155.74s]  I am.
[7156.38s -> 7158.38s]  Is that why you said that?
[7158.38s -> 7159.66s]  That is why I said that.
[7161.58s -> 7164.30s]  It's very important if it's more or not.
[7164.86s -> 7171.31s]  You got to know that gaming.
[7171.31s -> 7172.54s]  All right.
[7172.54s -> 7173.98s]  What the heck am I going to do?
[7174.70s -> 7175.26s]  Let me look.
[7175.90s -> 7182.59s]  It's going to run around and pick up bonfires.
[7182.59s -> 7186.04s]  I'm going to do a poll because I want Chad to decide.
[7189.36s -> 7193.36s]  We have three lights, inferno, crozier.
[7193.36s -> 7202.14s]  This is just a straight up just strength weapon.
[7202.14s -> 7204.80s]  Big hammer.
[7204.80s -> 7207.37s]  We also have I'm not going to put that on the list.
[7207.37s -> 7209.69s]  You'll pick it and it'll ruin my game.
[7209.69s -> 7224.04s]  We have the double Omen killer swing dual weld double Omen killer.
[7224.04s -> 7246.62s]  We've got acts of Godfrey, the acts of Godfrey make you
[7261.08s -> 7289.12s]  You hear anything in music playing?
[7289.12s -> 7294.59s]  Two big knives is funny, but also the acts of Godfrey.
[7294.59s -> 7299.88s]  This could be funny too because I'll keep mispronouncing the name.
[7299.88s -> 7307.05s]  I'm going to say like, oh, acts of goat fry and everyone's going to laugh.
[7307.05s -> 7308.01s]  That's funny.
[7308.01s -> 7318.88s]  I'll mispronounce it a few times.
[7318.88s -> 7320.80s]  I can't alt tab because it might crash the game.
[7320.80s -> 7322.16s]  So what's what is it up?
[7322.16s -> 7334.33s]  Dude, Godfrey one.
[7334.33s -> 7335.13s]  Oh, shit.
[7335.13s -> 7335.69s]  Cool.
[7335.69s -> 7339.60s]  What about the God Slayer colossal sword?
[7339.60s -> 7352.91s]  You mean this thing that's like a deck strength.
[7352.91s -> 7354.11s]  They I don't know.
[7354.11s -> 7362.20s]  It's the best sword.
[7364.14s -> 7365.58s]  Dual welding is up.
[7365.58s -> 7365.90s]  Okay.
[7365.90s -> 7366.94s]  So that's what we're doing.
[7366.94s -> 7373.56s]  Double Omen wins double Omen killers.
[7373.56s -> 7374.36s]  Oh, shit.
[7374.36s -> 7375.00s]  All right.
[7375.00s -> 7379.71s]  Okay, stir.
[7379.71s -> 7382.49s]  Let me get your opinion.
[7382.49s -> 7387.52s]  Yeah, your opinion is worth 5% of the vote that that honestly in the grand scheme of
[7387.52s -> 7388.80s]  things is not much.
[7388.80s -> 7390.64s]  That actually is it close.
[7390.64s -> 7391.28s]  It's pretty close.
[7392.92s -> 7398.56s]  Double Omen killer dual welding strong guy.
[7398.56s -> 7403.23s]  If you do that, I'm going to vote against it.
[7403.23s -> 7407.60s]  Like I want you to do that, but I'm going to vote against it if you keep saying dual welding.
[7407.60s -> 7418.91s]  Like dual wielding great Omen killer cleaver acts of Godfrey.
[7418.91s -> 7420.59s]  Who the fuck is Godfrey?
[7420.59s -> 7421.15s]  It's funny.
[7421.95s -> 7424.27s]  Oh, Godfrey, Godfrey, Godfrey.
[7424.27s -> 7424.91s]  Okay.
[7424.91s -> 7426.75s]  Yeah.
[7426.75s -> 7428.27s]  And what's special about that axe?
[7428.27s -> 7432.46s]  I said it kind of funnily.
[7432.46s -> 7432.94s]  That's it.
[7432.94s -> 7434.97s]  That's the reason you want to use it.
[7434.97s -> 7441.28s]  Or the big red hammer.
[7441.28s -> 7444.67s]  Oh, the charge one.
[7444.67s -> 7445.31s]  Yes.
[7445.31s -> 7448.03s]  That one's kind of fun.
[7448.03s -> 7452.59s]  I think practically the Omen killers is going to be the strongest one.
[7452.59s -> 7457.02s]  Okay, done.
[7457.02s -> 7460.46s]  And I think when you fight millennia with jump attacks with those,
[7461.02s -> 7463.98s]  you'll be happy to stick her face in the mud.
[7463.98s -> 7466.09s]  Oh, wow.
[7466.09s -> 7467.61s]  These look like two turkey legs.
[7467.61s -> 7467.93s]  All right.
[7467.93s -> 7469.37s]  So are these somber?
[7469.37s -> 7470.25s]  I hope they're not.
[7470.25s -> 7475.32s]  It's not.
[7475.32s -> 7475.72s]  Oh shit.
[7475.72s -> 7477.80s]  I have to do it to both of them.
[7477.80s -> 7478.36s]  Oh, no.
[7483.39s -> 7483.95s]  Oh, no.
[7483.95s -> 7487.07s]  I've picked up a couple of sombers, but I need regular.
[7488.52s -> 7491.32s]  Oh, then I can look and see what I got.
[7491.32s -> 7495.55s]  Dude, I will trade you like all of my sombers because I'm not going to be using them anymore.
[7495.55s -> 7499.00s]  You just have them all.
[7499.00s -> 7500.36s]  If I can have all of yours.
[7500.36s -> 7503.36s]  Dude, you are ruining the economy right now.
[7503.36s -> 7504.08s]  How many of these do I need?
[7504.08s -> 7505.04s]  I need a lot of these.
[7505.04s -> 7508.54s]  I was going to buy 200 of them.
[7508.54s -> 7511.68s]  I have one ancient.
[7511.68s -> 7512.32s]  Okay.
[7512.32s -> 7513.53s]  How many of these do I need?
[7513.53s -> 7515.05s]  I need 24 of these.
[7515.05s -> 7518.32s]  Jesus.
[7518.32s -> 7522.48s]  And I could potentially upgrade it for you because I only need one of each.
[7522.48s -> 7524.24s]  And I need 24 of these.
[7527.98s -> 7528.54s]  Right.
[7528.54s -> 7531.20s]  I mean, no.
[7531.20s -> 7532.43s]  Wait, stop, stop, stop.
[7532.43s -> 7532.91s]  What?
[7532.91s -> 7534.27s]  I need 12 of each.
[7534.27s -> 7537.61s]  Why did you say 24?
[7537.61s -> 7539.29s]  A bunch of you said 24.
[7539.29s -> 7546.43s]  24 for both.
[7546.43s -> 7547.39s]  That's what I mean.
[7547.39s -> 7551.32s]  24 was correct.
[7551.32s -> 7552.28s]  Yeah, I was right.
[7552.28s -> 7555.37s]  Why is everybody yelling at me?
[7555.37s -> 7556.88s]  It's 12 per weapon.
[7556.88s -> 7558.64s]  Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[7558.64s -> 7559.52s]  I had it right.
[7559.52s -> 7589.79s]  Here we go.
[7589.79s -> 7591.87s]  Yeah, you should let me upgrade those.
[7591.87s -> 7603.12s]  So I need smithing stone threes now.
[7603.12s -> 7605.87s]  I explained this early on.
[7605.87s -> 7610.43s]  This is like the one randomizer cheeto thing is that there's an option in the randomizer
[7610.43s -> 7612.89s]  to only need one stone per upgrade.
[7612.89s -> 7614.33s]  And he has it and I don't.
[7614.33s -> 7623.80s]  Because I've played randomizer before and it was just looking for stones for eight hours
[7623.80s -> 7625.37s]  and it was not fun.
[7625.37s -> 7632.25s]  What's the highest scaling thing that I have here?
[7632.25s -> 7656.33s]  Fire, flaming strike, flaming the red mains, wild strikes and flame of roar.
[7656.33s -> 7658.97s]  Oh, because yeah, I see what you're saying.
[7658.97s -> 7662.41s]  Well, I just wasted like 30,000 souls for no reason.
[7662.41s -> 7669.88s]  So you could get these just to like plus 25 each.
[7669.88s -> 7672.92s]  Yeah, if you have like I just need one of each stone per upgrade.
[7672.92s -> 7676.04s]  So when it costs you six stones, it would cost me one.
[7676.99s -> 7678.08s]  Shit.
[7678.08s -> 7681.98s]  Okay, so I need so I could do one.
[7681.98s -> 7685.04s]  Do you have any smithing stone threes?
[7685.04s -> 7686.56s]  I have like, yeah.
[7687.76s -> 7690.48s]  We're not going to get in a position where this is going to completely screw me over
[7690.48s -> 7691.68s]  and I'm not going to be able to take them.
[7691.68s -> 7694.75s]  What about the finger?
[7694.75s -> 7697.63s]  I have a plus 10 somber weapon.
[7697.63s -> 7700.73s]  Is that is that okay?
[7700.73s -> 7701.93s]  Honestly, I have no idea.
[7701.93s -> 7703.53s]  I would assume so, but.
[7703.53s -> 7705.93s]  So if I I don't want to get this wrong.
[7705.93s -> 7710.52s]  Because last time this all look, I got a plus 10 magma worm scale sword.
[7710.52s -> 7712.81s]  That's okay, because I'm fine.
[7712.81s -> 7716.14s]  Okay, I'm going to give you these both these weapons stir.
[7716.14s -> 7718.14s]  Please get them both to plus 25.
[7718.14s -> 7720.38s]  If you could.
[7720.38s -> 7721.98s]  Okay, I only have one ancient.
[7721.98s -> 7723.88s]  Or just get one that would be the main hand.
[7723.88s -> 7724.84s]  I can get them pretty high.
[7724.84s -> 7726.33s]  Yeah.
[7726.33s -> 7728.97s]  Okay, I duplicated my Eldenbeast remembrance.
[7729.85s -> 7733.77s]  So I'm going to use all my souls on your new company that you're launching
[7733.77s -> 7736.80s]  called Dual Welding Omen Killers.
[7736.80s -> 7739.90s]  I thought you told me never to use that.
[7739.90s -> 7741.34s]  I thought you said, no, don't do that anymore.
[7742.83s -> 7745.12s]  I don't think you can stop.
[7745.12s -> 7745.84s]  People are freaking out.
[7745.84s -> 7747.52s]  They're saying don't you're going to lose them again.
[7749.42s -> 7756.94s]  What's the real thing here?
[7756.94s -> 7759.10s]  Oh, do you have a plus 25?
[7759.10s -> 7769.18s]  I double I double duplicated my Eldenbeast remembrance.
[7769.18s -> 7779.21s]  I'm a double duper.
[7779.21s -> 7779.93s]  This is good.
[7779.93s -> 7782.08s]  I need a lot of endurance.
[7782.08s -> 7793.42s]  Go to at least 50 strength.
[7793.42s -> 7806.24s]  Is that okay?
[7806.24s -> 7808.51s]  50.
[7808.51s -> 7810.27s]  It was 12 decks.
[7810.27s -> 7810.99s]  Put these on.
[7810.99s -> 7818.59s]  That should be okay.
[7818.59s -> 7823.04s]  Do 26 endurance.
[7823.04s -> 7823.92s]  20 endurance?
[7823.92s -> 7824.40s]  No way.
[7824.96s -> 7831.37s]  I think this is fine.
[7831.37s -> 7831.77s]  All right.
[7831.77s -> 7835.39s]  We're in a good spot.
[7835.39s -> 7848.09s]  Now I just need to upgrade these and I'm going to be
[7848.09s -> 7850.57s]  I'm going to be an absolute slaughter.
[7850.57s -> 7859.90s]  Let me see what it looks like when I swing it.
[7859.90s -> 7860.70s]  Oh my goodness.
[7862.89s -> 7863.29s]  Yes.
[7866.01s -> 7866.41s]  All right.
[7866.41s -> 7867.93s]  This is worth it now for sure.
[7868.65s -> 7870.83s]  Make sure the jump attack thing is on.
[7871.47s -> 7873.52s]  Apparently it didn't double duper.
[7873.52s -> 7879.04s]  I need more talisman slots.
[7879.60s -> 7889.55s]  Try higher poise armor if I have any.
[7890.11s -> 7896.08s]  Still in medium.
[7903.23s -> 7906.41s]  Man, I am making so much progress right now.
[7906.41s -> 7907.45s]  I'm glad.
[7907.45s -> 7908.33s]  It's actually good to hear.
[7908.97s -> 7910.89s]  I am glad to hear that.
[7910.89s -> 7912.41s]  I am untethered.
[7919.04s -> 7919.76s]  That's heavy though.
[7920.32s -> 7925.26s]  Look at me.
[7940.75s -> 7941.39s]  All right, sir.
[7941.39s -> 7944.27s]  I am I'm ready for me to come to your world
[7944.27s -> 7947.79s]  for you to drop a plus 25 on the ground for me to see
[7947.79s -> 7950.75s]  if I can pick that plus 25 up off the ground
[7950.75s -> 7953.31s]  and then for you to then take my items
[7953.31s -> 7956.51s]  upgrade them to plus 25 and then give them back
[7956.51s -> 7957.55s]  or at least 24.
[7961.50s -> 7961.82s]  All right.
[7963.84s -> 7965.36s]  You look nasty.
[7965.36s -> 7965.60s]  Yep.
[7981.68s -> 7993.21s]  Why don't you go to bird feeder on your head?
[7993.21s -> 8001.58s]  What's up, dude?
[8002.14s -> 8004.73s]  Okay.
[8004.73s -> 8007.45s]  I am dropping you my only good weapon
[8007.45s -> 8011.69s]  that I've been using all game to prove that you can see it.
[8011.69s -> 8013.29s]  To prove that I can pick it up off the ground.
[8014.11s -> 8015.47s]  And then you're not going to give it back.
[8017.37s -> 8018.49s]  I need some collateral.
[8019.13s -> 8020.01s]  Just put it on the ground.
[8029.88s -> 8030.84s]  There it is.
[8030.84s -> 8031.40s]  Can you see it?
[8031.40s -> 8032.44s]  You don't need to pick it up.
[8032.44s -> 8036.36s]  I can pick it up plus 25 magic long sword.
[8037.32s -> 8037.80s]  There it is.
[8039.18s -> 8040.06s]  And I'm using it.
[8041.64s -> 8043.50s]  Oh, oh, right.
[8043.50s -> 8043.74s]  Okay.
[8045.05s -> 8045.29s]  Okay.
[8046.01s -> 8047.61s]  So now very cool.
[8047.61s -> 8051.93s]  I am very happy about this time to destroy the rest of this game.
[8053.93s -> 8058.43s]  I had a plus 10 scale sword.
[8058.43s -> 8060.51s]  Now we're going to see what happens when I get the real shit.
[8061.15s -> 8066.24s]  Ashes of war are applied to this item.
[8066.24s -> 8066.56s]  It's a lot.
[8066.56s -> 8067.28s]  Wait, is this okay?
[8067.92s -> 8069.48s]  Can you just give me my item back?
[8070.70s -> 8071.02s]  Prep.
[8073.88s -> 8074.12s]  All right.
[8074.12s -> 8074.28s]  Okay.
[8074.28s -> 8078.12s]  So you're giving me your this is scary.
[8078.12s -> 8079.00s]  I kind of don't like this.
[8081.69s -> 8086.65s]  You're taking the only thing I have to make you just took the only thing I have.
[8086.65s -> 8087.13s]  That's true.
[8087.85s -> 8088.09s]  Okay.
[8088.09s -> 8088.49s]  Here you go.
[8089.05s -> 8104.24s]  There's one and here's the other one.
[8104.24s -> 8104.56s]  Cool.
[8105.12s -> 8107.02s]  Okay.
[8107.02s -> 8108.89s]  I banish you.
[8113.87s -> 8114.11s]  Okay.
[8114.11s -> 8123.28s]  Let's go to tried.
[8123.28s -> 8125.50s]  Won't let me doing that thing again.
[8137.53s -> 8164.32s]  Try again, try again, try again.
[8164.32s -> 8170.44s]  I cannot wait back alley deals for sword upgrades.
[8184.12s -> 8187.37s]  You look like one of those street performers that paint themselves
[8187.37s -> 8190.35s]  silver and stand around all day.
[8190.35s -> 8191.95s]  Uh, do you have a smithing eight?
[8193.39s -> 8194.19s]  I'm going to need those.
[8198.64s -> 8199.36s]  I don't.
[8199.36s -> 8201.28s]  I have smithing six is the highest I have.
[8201.92s -> 8212.20s]  Oh, let me, let me complete that thought.
[8214.75s -> 8216.44s]  Like, hold on.
[8216.60s -> 8227.34s]  I got them to 16 and 18, but I am out of, um, smithing stone six.
[8228.49s -> 8229.21s]  Oh, I have those.
[8229.85s -> 8231.29s]  Just drop all the smithing stones.
[8231.29s -> 8234.65s]  You have a past six.
[8235.60s -> 8237.68s]  All of them or just singles.
[8241.32s -> 8246.38s]  I only have up to six that plus plus 18 plus that's fine.
[8246.94s -> 8249.08s]  Do you understand what we're doing and why I need them?
[8249.08s -> 8250.04s]  Just drop them.
[8250.04s -> 8252.12s]  I only have sixes though.
[8252.12s -> 8255.48s]  Drop them then you told me you needed plus sevens.
[8257.39s -> 8260.03s]  I, you, I, I'm upgrading two weapons.
[8260.03s -> 8271.77s]  I needed a lot there.
[8271.77s -> 8273.29s]  There's every smithing stone I own.
[8274.94s -> 8276.62s]  I do feel like this is some kind of a scam.
[8278.01s -> 8279.29s]  Like you're going to be like, oh, thanks.
[8279.93s -> 8281.85s]  And you're going to pick those all up and disconnect.
[8281.85s -> 8283.21s]  And we're never going to talk ever again.
[8284.92s -> 8288.44s]  Well, uh, I got them both to 19 and we need sevens.
[8288.44s -> 8296.80s]  Just pick all those up because you probably need them eventually.
[8297.60s -> 8298.32s]  For some reason.
[8299.56s -> 8299.72s]  Yeah.
[8299.72s -> 8309.28s]  When you switch builds again, streamer beats Elden ring only using the kick.
[8309.92s -> 8311.98s]  There they are.
[8311.98s -> 8312.70s]  There's your items.
[8313.02s -> 8313.34s]  We got them.
[8313.34s -> 8313.58s]  Get them.
[8313.58s -> 8314.14s]  Get them quick.
[8314.14s -> 8314.78s]  You're about to cry.
[8314.78s -> 8315.90s]  I know they do spawn.
[8315.90s -> 8316.46s]  Oh shit.
[8316.46s -> 8317.34s]  That actually could happen.
[8322.43s -> 8323.23s]  How am I?
[8323.23s -> 8326.51s]  268 plus 232 and it's a double.
[8329.69s -> 8331.53s]  Do you have the claw talisman for jump attacks?
[8331.53s -> 8334.41s]  I do, but I'm not going to use it.
[8335.55s -> 8337.15s]  Because you're scared.
[8337.15s -> 8339.55s]  No, because I want the extra ruins for now.
[8339.55s -> 8343.07s]  He's scared.
[8344.11s -> 8345.39s]  What a fucking baby.
[8345.39s -> 8345.79s]  Shut up.
[8346.67s -> 8349.72s]  I'm not scared of the jump attack.
[8349.72s -> 8350.12s]  Shut up.
[8350.68s -> 8351.79s]  Shut up.
[8351.79s -> 8353.34s]  Eat it.
[8353.34s -> 8354.06s]  You're it.
[8354.06s -> 8354.94s]  Shut up stupid.
[8355.50s -> 8358.11s]  I'm not scared of your idiot.
[8358.11s -> 8362.36s]  All right, I'm ready to play the video game.
[8362.36s -> 8366.04s]  That's fantastic news for people who like watching you play video games.
[8366.04s -> 8370.68s]  So let's go back to I'm imagining I'm going to follow you to put the artist shack
[8370.68s -> 8372.68s]  and then we're going to go into the upside down world.
[8372.68s -> 8373.88s]  Oh, no, I can.
[8377.88s -> 8382.14s]  I think you think you can accept the votes places you haven't been.
[8382.14s -> 8383.02s]  I cannot.
[8383.02s -> 8387.05s]  I have to go to the artist shack.
[8387.05s -> 8388.57s]  Wasn't there a way we did this before?
[8388.57s -> 8390.81s]  You totally joined me in a place you hadn't been to before.
[8390.81s -> 8392.01s]  I think it's because I.
[8392.01s -> 8394.25s]  Oh, because we were disconnected and you never.
[8394.65s -> 8398.01s]  Oh, you were there and I just connected to you.
[8400.17s -> 8405.40s]  Well, then you we have to go from the artist shack is right there.
[8405.40s -> 8407.08s]  Is that is it not right there?
[8407.08s -> 8408.28s]  No, you got to go down the hill.
[8408.28s -> 8412.80s]  We got to go to Academy gate town and then go up the hill.
[8412.80s -> 8415.88s]  Fight millennia, fight millennia.
[8415.88s -> 8416.52s]  Who?
[8416.52s -> 8421.42s]  I'm not fighting millennia until these are both plus 20.
[8421.42s -> 8434.70s]  I told her to lose my number and she cried.
[8434.70s -> 8436.78s]  All right, let's go.
[8436.78s -> 8440.86s]  I've got my final build.
[8460.92s -> 8461.72s]  You look really cool.
[8462.67s -> 8464.67s]  Where your cape is like fluttering.
[8465.31s -> 8469.20s]  You look pretty cool, too.
[8472.38s -> 8475.10s]  The way your smirk goes up on one side of your face
[8475.10s -> 8478.64s]  to reveal your deep level of confidence that you have.
[8481.98s -> 8485.07s]  Let me I want this now.
[8485.07s -> 8491.95s]  So I want it now.
[8492.91s -> 8494.09s]  That's you.
[8494.89s -> 8503.52s]  That's you, man.
[8504.16s -> 8505.16s]  All right, won't go.
[8505.16s -> 8506.12s]  How much for a golden goose?
[8506.68s -> 8508.67s]  No, they're not for sale.
[8509.63s -> 8510.43s]  OK, but how much?
[8520.96s -> 8521.52s]  All right.
[8521.52s -> 8523.04s]  Here we are.
[8523.04s -> 8525.44s]  Let's do the upside down level.
[8533.21s -> 8534.97s]  Having some trouble kind of.
[8536.33s -> 8537.61s]  My health bar is girthy.
[8537.61s -> 8540.81s]  Yeah, I actually like doubled my health from when we were fighting millennia.
[8545.29s -> 8547.13s]  Did you or where are you?
[8547.77s -> 8548.33s]  All right.
[8548.33s -> 8550.49s]  You want to turn this upside down or you want to clear it first?
[8552.64s -> 8556.78s]  Do you there's not even a boss here.
[8556.78s -> 8560.08s]  Is there a reason to I don't think so.
[8573.02s -> 8573.74s]  There are items.
[8575.10s -> 8577.02s]  Yeah, but they're like not good items.
[8577.02s -> 8581.77s]  Then we're like we're pretty like so huge that we don't even need them.
[8583.37s -> 8594.28s]  We are pretty beefy at this stage.
[8594.28s -> 8599.90s]  I'm not going to find the axe of Godfrey and go and then restart my whole character.
[8602.24s -> 8603.28s]  Oh, hey, check it out, man.
[8605.39s -> 8606.51s]  But you wish you were this cool.
[8610.62s -> 8611.74s]  Yeah, that's my great rune.
[8620.73s -> 8622.25s]  Yeah, I can do it, too.
[8622.97s -> 8623.53s]  You have one.
[8627.63s -> 8628.59s]  Kind of weird that you would lie.
[8631.93s -> 8634.01s]  My power is your power.
[8635.53s -> 8637.13s]  I'm the one who passed it down to you.
[8643.95s -> 8645.79s]  This isn't upside down verse.
[8645.87s -> 8648.83s]  Do you need you need the elevator to go up to go on the upside down area?
[8649.55s -> 8650.11s]  It's fucking.
[8652.24s -> 8653.36s]  This is the normal way.
[8653.36s -> 8654.16s]  Why is this normal?
[8654.72s -> 8655.44s]  Come down.
[8657.34s -> 8658.78s]  Come, come.
[8658.78s -> 8659.90s]  Why is it right side up?
[8664.16s -> 8664.96s]  Now you have to go.
[8665.60s -> 8668.49s]  Wait, do we go through that window?
[8669.21s -> 8672.64s]  We go through that window.
[8672.64s -> 8673.68s]  Yeah, something's wrong.
[8673.68s -> 8674.56s]  You need the hourglass.
[8674.56s -> 8675.36s]  We just put it on there.
[8680.52s -> 8682.60s]  I think I took the hourglass off.
[8682.60s -> 8683.80s]  You I think you took it off.
[8683.80s -> 8687.47s]  You I think you put it on and then I took it off.
[8688.46s -> 8690.30s]  Wait, why did you take it off?
[8690.30s -> 8692.88s]  I don't know.
[8692.88s -> 8693.44s]  Come down here.
[8694.08s -> 8696.72s]  You walked up to the thing after I did that and you picked it up.
[8697.79s -> 8698.11s]  Yeah.
[8698.67s -> 8699.79s]  Why did you do that?
[8699.79s -> 8701.95s]  I didn't realize that you did it because I didn't think that you had it.
[8706.64s -> 8709.69s]  It's going back upside down again.
[8709.69s -> 8710.97s]  OK, I put it back on.
[8710.97s -> 8712.17s]  OK, it's back up.
[8712.17s -> 8712.89s]  It's yeah.
[8712.89s -> 8713.37s]  All right.
[8713.37s -> 8715.77s]  But then it flipped everyone.
[8715.77s -> 8716.49s]  They all died.
[8717.39s -> 8718.59s]  Yeah, it just killed everybody.
[8728.36s -> 8729.48s]  This guy's still here, though.
[8734.70s -> 8738.22s]  I loved I loved this area on my first playthrough.
[8738.30s -> 8740.30s]  When that guy's down, they're just casting.
[8740.30s -> 8741.42s]  Oh, that's right.
[8741.42s -> 8742.46s]  It's so awful.
[8742.46s -> 8760.08s]  I loved it.
[8760.08s -> 8760.56s]  Watch out.
[8760.56s -> 8763.48s]  There's a giant gargle.
[8763.48s -> 8764.36s]  I got to hit this.
[8765.00s -> 8767.93s]  Watch out for the gargle.
[8768.57s -> 8774.35s]  All right, we should go around.
[8776.06s -> 8778.22s]  I think the gargoyle is going to fall off.
[8778.22s -> 8781.02s]  I would say we should probably should bait the gargoyle to attack.
[8781.02s -> 8782.30s]  So it falls straight down.
[8783.10s -> 8787.55s]  It's good to me.
[8788.11s -> 8790.94s]  OK, I'm just going to continue this way.
[8790.94s -> 8793.02s]  And it can't even like fit over here.
[8796.33s -> 8798.41s]  Um, it's like three, two, one.
[8798.41s -> 8798.97s]  You're going to die.
[8799.77s -> 8804.48s]  What are you doing?
[8804.48s -> 8807.85s]  I'm kind of in trouble.
[8816.76s -> 8818.12s]  He's still alive down there.
[8819.66s -> 8821.10s]  How is he still alive?
[8821.10s -> 8823.98s]  OK, well, there'll be a problem in about five minutes.
[8833.72s -> 8835.88s]  Holy shit, there's a thousand damage.
[8835.88s -> 8853.23s]  This is so overwhelming.
[8856.76s -> 8857.88s]  How is this guy still alive?
[8858.52s -> 8860.04s]  He just stabbed himself in the chest.
[8861.69s -> 8862.65s]  Wow, I guess he wins.
[8864.64s -> 8866.08s]  I got Erd Tree Heal.
[8866.08s -> 8868.24s]  He just stabbed himself through the heart.
[8870.65s -> 8872.09s]  I got Erd Tree Heal if you want it.
[8873.45s -> 8874.81s]  I'd expect off the healing.
[8875.45s -> 8879.12s]  That's a big drop.
[8886.84s -> 8887.40s]  We're fine.
[8889.77s -> 8893.29s]  One problem, though, is we have an issue in a minute.
[8893.85s -> 8895.05s]  Once we get down a little further.
[8907.48s -> 8908.12s]  Items.
[8908.12s -> 8912.28s]  You're blocking me.
[8913.08s -> 8914.04s]  You said, oh, items.
[8914.04s -> 8915.24s]  I turned to look.
[8917.98s -> 8920.22s]  Oh, it's the people that fell when you turned it.
[8930.11s -> 8934.46s]  Dang.
[8934.46s -> 8935.10s]  Items up here?
[8935.10s -> 8935.34s]  Yeah.
[8935.34s -> 8935.58s]  Yeah.
[8936.54s -> 8939.82s]  Yeah, he landed in an unfortunate spot.
[8939.82s -> 8940.46s]  Yes, he did.
[8941.18s -> 8942.75s]  I thought I was going to kill him.
[8944.86s -> 8946.06s]  He's full health.
[8946.06s -> 8949.55s]  He's dumb.
[8949.55s -> 8949.87s]  In it.
[8952.65s -> 8953.69s]  Twilight shots.
[8953.69s -> 8959.50s]  I feel like he's just going to baseball swing one of us off this ledge.
[8975.02s -> 8976.22s]  I guess as ready as we're going to be.
[8977.02s -> 8982.12s]  Who goes first?
[8994.48s -> 8995.60s]  Oh, God, you got you guys.
[8995.60s -> 8996.08s]  What?
[8996.08s -> 8997.04s]  Oh, we went down.
[8997.60s -> 8998.48s]  You touched the thing.
[8999.12s -> 9000.00s]  Well, why do I spill?
[9002.49s -> 9003.45s]  He's going to be still.
[9003.45s -> 9004.33s]  Wait, can we crush him?
[9005.13s -> 9005.61s]  Wait, what?
[9006.65s -> 9007.29s]  Oh, fuck.
[9007.93s -> 9008.73s]  He's not coming down, right?
[9009.45s -> 9013.64s]  He's dead.
[9013.64s -> 9015.69s]  Is he dead?
[9015.69s -> 9023.02s]  How do I make this go back up?
[9023.02s -> 9024.30s]  You can't step on him again?
[9024.30s -> 9024.46s]  No.
[9028.03s -> 9028.67s]  Is there a lever?
[9029.23s -> 9030.11s]  Can you pull something?
[9033.21s -> 9033.53s]  Hold on.
[9033.53s -> 9033.93s]  I don't think so.
[9033.93s -> 9034.33s]  Let me see.
[9034.89s -> 9039.48s]  Well, shit.
[9048.09s -> 9048.41s]  Maybe.
[9048.97s -> 9050.40s]  Is there no lever up?
[9050.40s -> 9051.04s]  There's no lever.
[9051.04s -> 9051.44s]  I don't think.
[9051.44s -> 9053.12s]  There's a bonfire outside, though.
[9053.68s -> 9059.08s]  Yeah, what happens if you reset the area and you touched it?
[9059.08s -> 9060.12s]  Like if you die down there.
[9060.86s -> 9061.50s]  Oh, no.
[9062.06s -> 9062.38s]  I'm sorry.
[9062.38s -> 9062.94s]  I just did.
[9062.94s -> 9064.30s]  I just there's a cut scene now.
[9070.68s -> 9072.12s]  I forget what the heck is down here.
[9072.68s -> 9078.52s]  This is how you go over to the other part of the tower.
[9081.72s -> 9082.68s]  The howling tree?
[9083.90s -> 9084.62s]  No, this is the thing.
[9084.62s -> 9089.47s]  The one where you were talking about where you get invaded.
[9089.47s -> 9091.45s]  So what?
[9091.45s -> 9094.01s]  Yeah, if I step on this, I think the elevator might just be there for you.
[9094.01s -> 9094.73s]  Let's see.
[9094.73s -> 9095.77s]  Oh, I spawned here with you.
[9096.33s -> 9098.14s]  Oh, I see.
[9098.14s -> 9099.26s]  Cut scene teleport me.
[9105.05s -> 9105.77s]  Wow.
[9105.77s -> 9107.77s]  So am I just dumping strength?
[9107.77s -> 9110.81s]  Dumping strength or jump into health?
[9110.81s -> 9113.16s]  Get health to like 50 first.
[9114.12s -> 9114.28s]  Yeah.
[9114.28s -> 9115.32s]  Should I get strength to?
[9115.96s -> 9116.92s]  What's your health at?
[9116.92s -> 9117.96s]  What's the vigor?
[9117.96s -> 9118.60s]  Uh, 40.
[9120.44s -> 9121.84s]  What's your strength at?
[9121.84s -> 9122.24s]  50.
[9124.60s -> 9125.16s]  Yeah, I'll get it.
[9125.16s -> 9126.84s]  I'll get this to 50 and then just dump everything.
[9126.84s -> 9128.12s]  Growing boy.
[9128.12s -> 9128.92s]  Look at how strong I am.
[9129.56s -> 9130.52s]  You're really.
[9130.52s -> 9131.32s]  Oh, my God.
[9133.95s -> 9135.71s]  Yeah, I'm a I'm a Flintstone kid.
[9140.56s -> 9141.44s]  Yeah, you can walk.
[9142.00s -> 9145.08s]  You're gonna bug out the cut scene.
[9145.72s -> 9151.39s]  Watch out snail on the road.
[9151.71s -> 9158.86s]  Oh, my minus.
[9158.86s -> 9161.42s]  Oh, Gen Z doesn't get that one, dude.
[9161.42s -> 9162.30s]  Oh, that's true.
[9172.32s -> 9174.32s]  Is this doesn't it happen here?
[9176.17s -> 9177.61s]  This is not where it happens.
[9177.61s -> 9178.57s]  I believe so.
[9178.57s -> 9179.53s]  On the other side of the door.
[9180.25s -> 9187.16s]  And I hope it's some really weird enemies.
[9187.80s -> 9195.50s]  But if you crouch, they can't see you.
[9196.54s -> 9197.42s]  It was the snail.
[9197.42s -> 9198.94s]  You said crouching was useless.
[9198.94s -> 9200.06s]  Wait, it was the snail.
[9200.78s -> 9202.16s]  Did we just run by that?
[9202.16s -> 9202.80s]  Stupid.
[9202.80s -> 9204.00s]  The snail was the boss.
[9204.00s -> 9209.55s]  It didn't go into the cut scene, though.
[9212.16s -> 9214.00s]  Do you have to kill the snail to activate it?
[9220.09s -> 9221.61s]  This elevator takes so long, though.
[9240.57s -> 9254.22s]  Oh, but oh, we're on great run.
[9255.02s -> 9255.90s]  You got another great run.
[9256.46s -> 9258.22s]  Yeah, I'm loaded.
[9258.78s -> 9264.17s]  OK, so we jump here.
[9265.98s -> 9267.18s]  Go back and we kill the snail.
[9267.18s -> 9268.38s]  We go back and we kill the snail.
[9270.11s -> 9274.83s]  It's just I want to support to wait.
[9274.83s -> 9275.55s]  What do you think?
[9275.55s -> 9276.51s]  What's going through your head?
[9276.51s -> 9277.47s]  We got to kill a snail.
[9278.27s -> 9280.65s]  It's bugged again.
[9281.45s -> 9282.49s]  I tried.
[9283.05s -> 9285.15s]  No, he doesn't deserve it.
[9285.15s -> 9286.35s]  This is not the right tower.
[9291.98s -> 9293.02s]  You're thinking of a different bridge.
[9294.11s -> 9295.87s]  Yeah, I think we just have this tower now.
[9296.75s -> 9300.65s]  OK, then where are we going next?
[9300.65s -> 9303.87s]  Well, we were going up this path.
[9303.87s -> 9305.47s]  There's still an urn tree.
[9305.47s -> 9309.87s]  We could do the snow zone.
[9309.87s -> 9313.71s]  Use your medallion and get up there.
[9313.71s -> 9316.19s]  We could do some more.
[9316.19s -> 9316.83s]  Where do you do that?
[9318.00s -> 9320.80s]  We have to go through the capital
[9321.36s -> 9322.48s]  and go down that road.
[9322.48s -> 9324.80s]  And we go up the lift and go to the snow zone.
[9324.80s -> 9331.00s]  The snail is supposed to be a noble.
[9331.00s -> 9331.80s]  Oh, that's right.
[9331.80s -> 9332.12s]  Yeah.
[9332.12s -> 9333.56s]  No, that is where one of the nobles is.
[9333.56s -> 9334.12s]  Yeah.
[9334.12s -> 9334.68s]  Go to the bridge.
[9335.87s -> 9339.37s]  The snail is going to have boss loot.
[9339.37s -> 9344.89s]  Oh, fucking.
[9344.89s -> 9350.20s]  Boss loot, boss loot, boss loot, boss loot, boss loot, boss loot.
[9350.20s -> 9352.92s]  We can also apparently go to Radon's tower,
[9352.92s -> 9361.66s]  which I think we have a portal to.
[9361.66s -> 9364.70s]  What major thing have we not done besides the snow zone?
[9365.98s -> 9367.18s]  We're pretty we're close.
[9368.32s -> 9370.08s]  We're close to being able to beat the game.
[9370.80s -> 9372.48s]  We never went down to Moog.
[9372.48s -> 9373.36s]  We didn't do Moog.
[9373.92s -> 9376.64s]  But do we really want to do Moog?
[9377.90s -> 9378.94s]  I forget where you were.
[9378.94s -> 9380.54s]  You even enter that area.
[9380.54s -> 9382.94s]  The Caelid's tower is Radon.
[9382.94s -> 9387.56s]  Oh, my God.
[9387.56s -> 9388.36s]  It really was.
[9389.40s -> 9389.64s]  What?
[9390.70s -> 9391.10s]  OK.
[9391.10s -> 9392.78s]  There's so many items.
[9395.13s -> 9395.45s]  Hold on.
[9395.45s -> 9395.93s]  I just got.
[9395.93s -> 9396.49s]  What was that?
[9402.24s -> 9408.12s]  Man, that guy was loaded.
[9408.12s -> 9409.56s]  I got another piece of the Curseful Knight.
[9410.68s -> 9411.24s]  Holy shit.
[9420.43s -> 9421.39s]  Now I look pretty cool.
[9427.16s -> 9430.04s]  OK, so, yeah, we can either go up the lift.
[9430.04s -> 9430.52s]  We can do.
[9434.68s -> 9437.48s]  Do we have any blue keys?
[9437.48s -> 9440.59s]  We could do one of the teleporters.
[9442.84s -> 9443.80s]  What are those keys called?
[9444.60s -> 9446.84s]  They're like a blue stone sword or something.
[9446.84s -> 9448.12s]  They have a special name.
[9448.12s -> 9449.16s]  I have one.
[9449.16s -> 9451.16s]  I have imbued sword key.
[9451.16s -> 9452.36s]  Which one of those is unsealed?
[9452.36s -> 9454.20s]  Yeah, that is a unsealed sending gate.
[9454.84s -> 9461.88s]  I know one of them takes you to the sewers, right?
[9463.61s -> 9467.37s]  One goes to a random spot in Nocaran.
[9467.93s -> 9471.66s]  One goes to Faramazula and one goes to.
[9472.38s -> 9473.69s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[9473.69s -> 9474.41s]  The last one goes.
[9479.87s -> 9480.99s]  It's far away in firm.
[9480.99s -> 9482.19s]  It's like in the distance, though.
[9482.19s -> 9483.07s]  It's not the actual zone.
[9483.63s -> 9484.83s]  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9486.84s -> 9487.56s]  Oh, it's that.
[9487.56s -> 9492.73s]  It's the tutorial zone where you go.
[9493.45s -> 9497.21s]  We fight that sentry thing, the scion, whatever it is.
[9497.21s -> 9498.33s]  OK, let's just go there.
[9498.33s -> 9500.97s]  And we none of us remember which one goes where.
[9500.97s -> 9502.01s]  So let's just use one.
[9502.01s -> 9502.41s]  Cool.
[9502.41s -> 9504.44s]  I mean, I'm down for that.
[9504.44s -> 9504.84s]  Whoops.
[9504.84s -> 9506.20s]  I voted Ronnie's rise.
[9506.20s -> 9508.28s]  That's not that's not correct.
[9508.28s -> 9509.96s]  It's down here at the four Belfry.
[9510.52s -> 9529.64s]  Vote rejected because I vote the wrong place.
[9530.28s -> 9533.87s]  There we go.
[9533.87s -> 9540.81s]  I have the hiccups.
[9540.81s -> 9548.14s]  Do something, dude, for like a strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry.
[9548.14s -> 9551.39s]  Bet you don't have many more for like a month.
[9551.39s -> 9555.07s]  Every time I started my stream, I got hiccups.
[9557.37s -> 9558.33s]  It was uncanny.
[9559.68s -> 9562.97s]  Like stream start hiccups weird.
[9562.97s -> 9564.54s]  All right.
[9564.54s -> 9565.42s]  So which one do you want to do?
[9567.31s -> 9571.02s]  That's one on the left.
[9571.02s -> 9572.78s]  I don't remember which one this one is.
[9572.78s -> 9574.46s]  There's one that's awful.
[9574.46s -> 9577.58s]  And it literally is just a tiny little part of knock Ron.
[9577.58s -> 9579.34s]  That's one crystal night and it's awful.
[9579.98s -> 9582.62s]  Yeah, I think that's the one to our left right now
[9582.62s -> 9585.24s]  because I remember fighting that guy a lot.
[9585.24s -> 9590.11s]  I think I had to go back through that portal every time.
[9590.11s -> 9596.99s]  We didn't do the Lake of Rod.
[9596.99s -> 9598.75s]  No, that's another underground area we haven't been to.
[9598.75s -> 9602.60s]  Oh, it's the chapel.
[9602.60s -> 9606.91s]  It's a chapel.
[9609.58s -> 9610.38s]  Oh, your host.
[9610.38s -> 9610.86s]  You can see it.
[9610.86s -> 9613.26s]  You get to have the you get to see the movie before I do.
[9613.26s -> 9615.34s]  Yeah, I'm in the movie theater already.
[9616.48s -> 9620.28s]  What was this in the very beginning?
[9620.28s -> 9624.44s]  Um, I I was like a berserker.
[9630.54s -> 9631.90s]  Ah, it was.
[9650.72s -> 9654.25s]  I'm just I'm just spamming L1.
[9654.25s -> 9654.89s]  Okay, we're good.
[9655.61s -> 9656.76s]  It's a bunch of items.
[9662.01s -> 9662.41s]  Okay.
[9663.37s -> 9665.61s]  So I got I got Twiggy cracked here.
[9665.61s -> 9668.33s]  That sounds like the name of some fucked up YouTube channel.
[9671.20s -> 9676.00s]  Uh, we go back into the church, right?
[9676.00s -> 9678.56s]  Isn't this a way to get up and walk around and look around, right?
[9679.82s -> 9681.66s]  And I don't think there's anything else here.
[9681.66s -> 9682.38s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[9682.38s -> 9683.02s]  Come over here.
[9683.02s -> 9683.90s]  I remember this up in here.
[9686.51s -> 9688.19s]  They say, um, there's a spot.
[9688.19s -> 9688.59s]  Did you have you?
[9688.59s -> 9689.39s]  Did you ever come back here?
[9690.60s -> 9693.32s]  Yeah, there's a spot up here.
[9693.88s -> 9696.28s]  I think on the ledge where you have to jump from it.
[9696.28s -> 9714.86s]  I think that kind of hurt my feelings.
[9716.49s -> 9718.49s]  I think we actually can get up in the church, though.
[9719.55s -> 9720.67s]  Yeah, but there's no reason to.
[9722.43s -> 9723.23s]  Who cares?
[9723.23s -> 9725.95s]  But there's items, this random stuff.
[9725.95s -> 9727.15s]  It could be a Lord's rune.
[9727.15s -> 9728.03s]  You don't know.
[9728.03s -> 9730.83s]  Oh, my God.
[9730.83s -> 9741.90s]  Who cares?
[9741.90s -> 9742.78s]  I do.
[9742.78s -> 9746.51s]  Now, how do you get to the road route from the Capitol?
[9746.51s -> 9755.18s]  Like you go, you just there's a what?
[9755.18s -> 9756.22s]  Wait, why is she?
[9756.22s -> 9757.10s]  Why is she alive?
[9761.85s -> 9765.04s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9765.04s -> 9766.08s]  Oh, yeah.
[9766.08s -> 9775.44s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9775.44s -> 9777.68s]  There's an is let me just see if it's a legendary.
[9777.68s -> 9778.64s]  Oh, is it?
[9778.64s -> 9779.12s]  I don't know.
[9779.12s -> 9780.16s]  It's in a chest.
[9780.16s -> 9784.11s]  It could be a legendary.
[9786.72s -> 9789.04s]  She's like the mushrooms growing out of her fucking head.
[9797.13s -> 9797.77s]  Yes, I know.
[9797.77s -> 9798.01s]  I know.
[9798.01s -> 9802.14s]  But look, letter from volcano manner.
[9802.14s -> 9803.82s]  That's why you come up here.
[9803.82s -> 9805.18s]  That's why you explore.
[9805.18s -> 9806.38s]  Now we can do right card.
[9806.94s -> 9809.88s]  I have that.
[9809.88s -> 9811.88s]  I mentioned it earlier and I said, I don't remember.
[9811.88s -> 9813.32s]  I got letter from volcano manner.
[9813.32s -> 9814.68s]  I don't know if we needed that or not.
[9814.68s -> 9816.60s]  Oh, it was like an hour ago.
[9822.68s -> 9823.48s]  Well, let's.
[9823.48s -> 9828.19s]  OK, you did write card.
[9828.19s -> 9829.77s]  That wasn't right card.
[9829.77s -> 9831.93s]  Now, that wasn't the real right card.
[9831.93s -> 9836.40s]  OK, so you want to write card, then we could give her letters and shit.
[9836.40s -> 9838.56s]  Yeah, let's see what's down there might as well.
[9839.60s -> 9844.80s]  We're going to hit a point here very soon where we're going to unlock the giant area.
[9844.80s -> 9848.14s]  We're going to do the giant and then we can just end the game.
[9848.14s -> 9852.17s]  You need the thing to burn in the bowl.
[9852.25s -> 9855.84s]  I think you need like an ember or something.
[9855.84s -> 9856.88s]  I think you just need.
[9856.88s -> 9860.62s]  I think you just need a certain millennia.
[9860.62s -> 9862.60s]  I think you just need her up there.
[9862.60s -> 9866.52s]  You sit at the bonfire up in the big crucible thing.
[9866.52s -> 9873.98s]  I don't think you need an item.
[9873.98s -> 9875.37s]  All right.
[9875.37s -> 9876.73s]  And then the letter over.
[9882.68s -> 9883.00s]  Join.
[9886.36s -> 9886.84s]  Thank you.
[9886.84s -> 9893.21s]  OK, so now we have to go do an invasion, right?
[9893.21s -> 9900.88s]  Wait, we're going to get a different item every time we do this.
[9900.88s -> 9906.72s]  There may be some flaws to the plan.
[9906.72s -> 9907.60s]  I have two of them.
[9907.60s -> 9914.52s]  I have I have I lay the idol and I have great horn to drag off.
[9914.52s -> 9916.12s]  I don't know the words you're saying.
[9916.12s -> 9930.64s]  Go into your where the letter is because there's three letters.
[9930.64s -> 9931.36s]  Who are you?
[9933.45s -> 9934.91s]  What does your letter say?
[9934.91s -> 9941.45s]  The letter you have the assassination missions are optional for right card.
[9941.45s -> 9944.60s]  I can't find it.
[9944.60s -> 9949.24s]  But so then how do we get down to right card if we have?
[9949.24s -> 9953.24s]  I thought you did those three and they're like, oh, yes, you can go talk to our lord.
[9953.88s -> 9955.56s]  I have the red letter.
[9955.56s -> 9962.78s]  I don't know how I it's past millennia.
[9962.78s -> 9965.34s]  Juno Haslow, Knight of Blood.
[9965.34s -> 9965.58s]  All right.
[9965.58s -> 9967.42s]  So wait, I have the other two.
[9967.42s -> 9969.02s]  There's only three, right?
[9969.02s -> 9973.21s]  Well, then also that enemy is going to be randomized.
[9973.21s -> 9978.36s]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[9979.00s -> 9984.17s]  Let's make our way up the road route.
[9984.17s -> 9984.81s]  Let's make our way.
[9984.81s -> 9985.05s]  All right.
[9985.05s -> 9989.05s]  East East Capitol Rampart or Capitol Rampart.
[9989.05s -> 9989.69s]  Which one of these?
[9989.93s -> 9993.85s]  I think you have to do the Avenue balcony and then run down the road.
[9993.85s -> 9994.65s]  I think you're right.
[9994.65s -> 9994.89s]  Yes.
[9994.89s -> 9995.29s]  No, you're right.
[9995.29s -> 9997.61s]  Because you open you open the door and you walk through.
[9997.61s -> 10008.97s]  Just kill millennia forehead.
[10008.97s -> 10011.85s]  Who?
[10011.85s -> 10014.17s]  Check your your physique tears.
[10014.17s -> 10017.53s]  Feels OK, man.
[10017.53s -> 10019.93s]  Chat just wants you guys to get mad at millennia.
[10019.93s -> 10020.43s]  Yeah.
[10020.89s -> 10023.13s]  You guys want us to go there and get stuck for four hours.
[10023.13s -> 10025.77s]  And like us make a bunch of cartoon sound effects.
[10026.49s -> 10029.93s]  And me to bite my mic stand and like smash my face to my microphone.
[10029.93s -> 10033.53s]  Yeah. And don't like bite my lips so hard that my lip bleeds a little bit.
[10036.88s -> 10037.36s]  That way.
[10037.36s -> 10039.04s]  Do we have to like jump off the edge over here?
[10039.04s -> 10046.48s]  Probably is a is a path that has it's the path that has the urge tree avatar on it.
[10046.48s -> 10049.00s]  Yeah, this is it's coming.
[10049.00s -> 10050.12s]  Are you sure it's not going to come with me?
[10050.12s -> 10050.52s]  I'll come with me.
[10050.52s -> 10050.92s]  No, come on.
[10050.92s -> 10051.48s]  No, come with me.
[10051.48s -> 10052.76s]  I think you can jump down.
[10052.76s -> 10052.92s]  Yeah.
[10052.92s -> 10053.64s]  No, come with me.
[10055.93s -> 10058.97s]  Yeah, I guess I'm doing I'll look in a minute once you get to a better spot.
[10058.97s -> 10059.37s]  Other way.
[10060.44s -> 10062.78s]  Well, what you make a decision here.
[10062.78s -> 10064.54s]  Oh, I didn't see you actually followed me.
[10064.54s -> 10067.66s]  Now you use your run speed ninjutsu.
[10067.66s -> 10069.58s]  We just have to go to the big door at the end, right?
[10070.97s -> 10085.40s]  Yes. So Andy, I like that was you need did you need somersmithing stone sevens?
[10089.08s -> 10090.04s]  I don't know what I need.
[10091.32s -> 10092.04s]  What is that?
[10092.60s -> 10096.30s]  What is this is the this is the wrong door.
[10097.02s -> 10098.14s]  Oh, it's another dragon.
[10098.14s -> 10100.22s]  This dragon so badly wants to get over.
[10100.22s -> 10105.85s]  No, no, it's this one because then we go up and wrap around.
[10105.85s -> 10106.49s]  This is like this.
[10106.49s -> 10107.05s]  Yeah, that's it.
[10108.22s -> 10111.37s]  I think now.
[10111.37s -> 10112.49s]  Yeah, this is definitely it.
[10114.24s -> 10119.32s]  OK, smash, smash, watch out.
[10122.46s -> 10124.25s]  Watch out.
[10124.25s -> 10125.05s]  We got a bleeder.
[10125.05s -> 10128.09s]  You know what one of my favorite sound effects is in all video games?
[10129.10s -> 10129.50s]  I don't.
[10130.43s -> 10139.10s]  It was when ever you got a double dunk from that like it was like a crit sound.
[10139.10s -> 10142.22s]  It was like it was the best sound effect in gaming.
[10142.94s -> 10155.64s]  And if you got more than one, if you did twice in a row, you'd be like,
[10159.00s -> 10162.76s]  something weird about seeing my wife type in all caps based,
[10162.76s -> 10165.00s]  like the streams have been having an effect on her
[10165.00s -> 10166.76s]  because she wouldn't have said that like a week ago.
[10173.53s -> 10173.93s]  Based.
[10181.52s -> 10182.00s]  What's wrong?
[10182.73s -> 10184.89s]  Now she just says, oh, with a crying face.
[10184.89s -> 10185.61s]  Now, I don't know.
[10187.71s -> 10188.51s]  She's in trouble.
[10189.85s -> 10191.45s]  And then she says, make it rain.
[10191.45s -> 10192.89s]  I make it rain.
[10193.85s -> 10195.61s]  It's just to get out of any conversation.
[10195.61s -> 10196.17s]  Make it rain.
[10196.81s -> 10197.37s]  Make it rain.
[10201.66s -> 10203.66s]  I thought you died your hair.
[10203.66s -> 10203.98s]  What?
[10205.12s -> 10205.84s]  Don't kill him.
[10205.84s -> 10206.72s]  He's a musician.
[10207.76s -> 10208.16s]  All right.
[10208.16s -> 10208.56s]  All right.
[10208.56s -> 10209.04s]  I won't.
[10209.04s -> 10209.52s]  I bounced.
[10211.60s -> 10211.92s]  Kill him.
[10211.92s -> 10212.96s]  He's a musician.
[10214.00s -> 10216.56s]  All right.
[10216.56s -> 10217.76s]  Play us a song then.
[10218.62s -> 10219.42s]  Play us a song.
[10220.06s -> 10224.43s]  Play us a song.
[10227.44s -> 10228.72s]  Oh, that's a hit.
[10229.36s -> 10229.92s]  Help.
[10229.92s -> 10230.56s]  Help.
[10230.56s -> 10230.88s]  What?
[10233.56s -> 10234.36s]  It's a magician.
[10235.00s -> 10239.21s]  Hold on.
[10239.21s -> 10243.34s]  Let me get the double dunk.
[10243.34s -> 10253.82s]  Nope.
[10253.82s -> 10256.78s]  Hey, play us up.
[10257.34s -> 10257.90s]  Roxanne.
[10258.80s -> 10259.92s]  You know, Roxanne.
[10259.92s -> 10260.64s]  Can you do that one?
[10263.77s -> 10265.69s]  Oh, that was pretty good.
[10270.62s -> 10271.26s]  No, please.
[10284.94s -> 10287.26s]  What's the highest minus a chatter can give you?
[10287.26s -> 10289.58s]  Like if they do a plus two or minus two,
[10289.58s -> 10291.34s]  when have you done something so awful
[10291.34s -> 10293.42s]  that they're allowed to be like minus 10?
[10293.42s -> 10294.06s]  It doesn't count.
[10296.73s -> 10299.53s]  It's it was it's either good or bad.
[10299.53s -> 10302.09s]  It's not like super good or super bad.
[10302.09s -> 10304.17s]  It's just it was that good or bad.
[10305.13s -> 10305.53s]  That's it.
[10306.33s -> 10309.80s]  Oh, mega dung beetle.
[10310.52s -> 10314.75s]  I don't know.
[10314.75s -> 10315.47s]  I don't want to kill this.
[10316.19s -> 10317.55s]  Oh, but you'll kill the musician.
[10318.27s -> 10320.78s]  The guy's just out there playing for tips.
[10331.95s -> 10334.35s]  No, there's no plus one or minus one.
[10335.37s -> 10336.49s]  It's always two.
[10336.49s -> 10337.69s]  Why is it always two?
[10337.69s -> 10338.89s]  I don't know because it's supposed to be
[10338.89s -> 10340.89s]  the amount of minutes to add or subtract.
[10340.89s -> 10341.85s]  Do you even know the lore?
[10342.65s -> 10343.37s]  I don't.
[10343.37s -> 10344.33s]  That's why I'm asking.
[10344.89s -> 10345.77s]  It's Alex and I.
[10347.10s -> 10349.02s]  We played Kane and Lynch.
[10349.02s -> 10350.22s]  This is the bridge, by the way.
[10350.22s -> 10350.86s]  Oh, let's do it.
[10351.50s -> 10354.30s]  I always honestly thought that plus two minus two.
[10354.30s -> 10355.82s]  Wait, where does this one this bridge?
[10357.98s -> 10361.34s]  I always thought plus two minus two was a Sims reference
[10361.34s -> 10363.74s]  because when you like your Sim has an interaction
[10363.74s -> 10365.02s]  that they do or don't like,
[10365.02s -> 10366.54s]  but you can get like the minus two.
[10366.54s -> 10368.38s]  Like, I don't I don't like what he's saying.
[10368.38s -> 10370.22s]  No, it was italics.
[10370.22s -> 10372.70s]  And I did a stream one time where we were like,
[10372.70s -> 10375.58s]  let's try to beat Kane and Lynch in one sitting.
[10375.58s -> 10377.61s]  The game is like three and a half hours
[10377.61s -> 10378.65s]  or four and a half hours long.
[10378.65s -> 10380.73s]  It's a very short game because it's the second one.
[10382.19s -> 10382.99s]  And we set up this thing.
[10382.99s -> 10383.47s]  Well, wait a minute.
[10383.47s -> 10386.70s]  What if we gave it a time limit for us
[10386.70s -> 10389.26s]  where we had to beat the game in two hours or something
[10389.26s -> 10390.76s]  or three hours.
[10390.76s -> 10393.29s]  But every time we made a good joke,
[10393.29s -> 10395.77s]  chat could add two minutes to the timer
[10395.77s -> 10398.65s]  or they could subtract two minutes from the timer.
[10398.65s -> 10400.06s]  Right. Okay.
[10400.62s -> 10402.62s]  So depending on how funny we were,
[10402.62s -> 10404.22s]  we got to have more time to beat the game.
[10404.22s -> 10408.09s]  And it actually turned out to be we we ended up
[10408.09s -> 10409.69s]  at the last cut scene of the game,
[10409.69s -> 10414.03s]  I think with less than two or three minutes left.
[10414.03s -> 10417.21s]  That's a plus two.
[10417.21s -> 10421.12s]  I liked it better when I thought it was The Sims.
[10421.12s -> 10426.97s]  I'm just sorry pretending as that.
[10426.97s -> 10428.09s]  Yeah. And we eventually,
[10428.09s -> 10429.61s]  once we had less than 20 minutes left,
[10429.61s -> 10430.97s]  we started getting kind of desperate
[10430.97s -> 10432.78s]  and the jokes were awful.
[10432.78s -> 10434.22s]  And we were losing time.
[10434.22s -> 10437.47s]  Is it a hidden room here?
[10437.47s -> 10438.27s]  Yeah, there is.
[10438.27s -> 10439.39s]  I did see it.
[10439.39s -> 10440.89s]  It was down at the bottom.
[10440.89s -> 10444.25s]  I don't think I've ever been in that hidden room.
[10444.25s -> 10446.01s]  I'd like to make it a point that when we come back,
[10446.01s -> 10447.13s]  we go to that hidden room.
[10447.13s -> 10453.04s]  This might break both of our games.
[10453.04s -> 10455.63s]  I don't think so.
[10455.63s -> 10459.66s]  It's just the Four Lords fight from Dark Souls 1.
[10459.66s -> 10463.32s]  Is it a dog?
[10463.32s -> 10464.36s]  Is it a single dog?
[10465.72s -> 10467.32s]  It's a dead guy.
[10467.40s -> 10468.20s]  It's a dead guy?
[10469.92s -> 10470.40s]  Why was it?
[10470.40s -> 10470.96s]  I don't know.
[10470.96s -> 10473.50s]  I've just been waiting for someone to fight me so long.
[10473.50s -> 10474.06s]  I died.
[10474.06s -> 10476.14s]  El Misbegotten Crusader.
[10476.14s -> 10478.38s]  And I got Hora Lou's Earth Shatter.
[10478.38s -> 10480.32s]  Earth Shaker.
[10480.32s -> 10481.32s]  Man.
[10481.32s -> 10483.00s]  What weapon is he holding?
[10483.00s -> 10486.44s]  Oh, they're usually two?
[10486.44s -> 10487.08s]  Yeah.
[10487.08s -> 10488.20s]  There's the dead guy in this guy.
[10488.20s -> 10490.60s]  That weapon is so cool looking.
[10490.60s -> 10491.72s]  That weapon is...
[10491.72s -> 10493.08s]  What weapon is that thing?
[10493.08s -> 10495.16s]  That's like the Elden Beast Remembrance.
[10495.16s -> 10495.64s]  Holy shit.
[10495.64s -> 10497.72s]  That thing is so fucking cool.
[10497.72s -> 10499.24s]  That's the coolest weapon in the game.
[10499.24s -> 10500.44s]  I've never seen that.
[10500.44s -> 10503.16s]  Isn't that the one that shoots like a gigantic super...
[10505.60s -> 10506.96s]  What the fuck?
[10506.96s -> 10508.24s]  I want this.
[10508.24s -> 10509.79s]  Hope he drops it.
[10509.79s -> 10518.54s]  It's the Golden Order Greatsword.
[10519.10s -> 10520.52s]  That thing is so cool.
[10521.24s -> 10530.17s]  Oh, time for Terma to change builds.
[10532.16s -> 10532.40s]  No.
[10534.30s -> 10535.58s]  That thing is awesome.
[10535.58s -> 10538.70s]  Scales great with Faith.
[10538.70s -> 10547.45s]  You have it in your inventory, bro.
[10547.45s -> 10548.41s]  I don't have it.
[10548.41s -> 10549.85s]  No, I don't.
[10549.85s -> 10550.73s]  You have to look now.
[10551.74s -> 10553.98s]  I don't.
[10553.98s -> 10556.54s]  I'm telling you, that sword is very distinct looking.
[10556.54s -> 10557.98s]  I do not have it in my inventory.
[10559.98s -> 10561.34s]  I have the Glintstone Chris.
[10562.06s -> 10564.51s]  Oh, you got Chris?
[10565.66s -> 10567.18s]  No, I don't have this weapon.
[10567.18s -> 10568.30s]  You guys are full of shit.
[10571.96s -> 10572.52s]  No.
[10572.52s -> 10585.07s]  I'm going to level up.
[10585.07s -> 10587.79s]  It's the Faith version of the Moonlit Greatsword.
[10587.79s -> 10589.23s]  So I'll give you a cool build.
[10590.36s -> 10592.20s]  Moonlit Greatsword one hand.
[10592.20s -> 10593.72s]  Golden Order Greatsword on the other hand.
[10595.85s -> 10596.17s]  Sun.
[10597.05s -> 10597.37s]  Moon.
[10598.01s -> 10600.17s]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[10600.73s -> 10602.25s]  The sun and moon conjoined.
[10602.97s -> 10604.89s]  Bat Chest me all you want.
[10604.89s -> 10606.33s]  That's what I'm doing on my next playthrough.
[10606.89s -> 10621.66s]  The Eclipse build.
[10623.93s -> 10626.17s]  Yeah, and I would wear really dark armor.
[10626.89s -> 10629.50s]  So it's like the sun and the moon eclipsing into each other.
[10629.50s -> 10629.98s]  Come on.
[10636.04s -> 10650.27s]  Do you identify as the darkness or the light?
[10650.27s -> 10653.55s]  Bro, you would need to be level 200 to even attempt that.
[10653.55s -> 10654.19s]  That's all right.
[10663.40s -> 10664.52s]  Mog's Greatrun.
[10666.88s -> 10668.48s]  I also got Mog's Greatrun.
[10671.00s -> 10671.88s]  Weird.
[10671.88s -> 10674.19s]  I think they're just here.
[10674.19s -> 10675.79s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[10675.79s -> 10679.10s]  Because you also had the thing?
[10679.10s -> 10679.74s]  No, I didn't.
[10680.30s -> 10682.38s]  Dude, I think they're just up here.
[10682.62s -> 10683.34s]  You can just pick them up.
[10684.80s -> 10688.88s]  Wasn't that the great rune that you heal when you hit things?
[10688.88s -> 10692.00s]  Yeah, but are you understanding that I think we could have just
[10692.00s -> 10694.16s]  come to two of these towers and gotten these?
[10694.16s -> 10696.88s]  I think you can just pick them up off the ground.
[10696.88s -> 10702.59s]  I think the randomizer just puts them here because I didn't have that.
[10702.59s -> 10704.11s]  I had the unborn one.
[10704.11s -> 10707.07s]  Well, yeah, that's millennials.
[10707.07s -> 10708.11s]  What does Mog's do?
[10708.11s -> 10710.11s]  Something about blood.
[10710.75s -> 10711.55s]  Blessing of blood.
[10711.55s -> 10712.80s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10712.80s -> 10713.60s]  All right.
[10713.60s -> 10715.52s]  Are you ready to go to the Forbidden Lands?
[10715.52s -> 10719.80s]  No, I want it to go down that elevator.
[10719.80s -> 10722.56s]  So yeah, Forbidden Lands.
[10722.56s -> 10725.20s]  And then I want to go in the elevator and do the secret room.
[10733.18s -> 10734.86s]  Yeah, I'll do the blast in a second.
[10734.86s -> 10754.83s]  I'm going to mark these because I know we'll forget.
[10765.26s -> 10765.82s]  Okay.
[10765.82s -> 10771.87s]  You're gonna tell a joke?
[10789.82s -> 10792.38s]  I think I saw it on the right when we were going up.
[10792.38s -> 10794.52s]  I think because we missed.
[10794.52s -> 10795.48s]  Oh, it's right there.
[10795.48s -> 10796.20s]  They're right in front of us.
[10796.20s -> 10796.92s]  Straight forward.
[10796.92s -> 10797.40s]  You see it?
[10797.40s -> 10799.34s]  You look up.
[10799.34s -> 10799.90s]  Yeah.
[10799.90s -> 10800.59s]  Okay.
[10800.59s -> 10801.31s]  We're going in there.
[10812.94s -> 10814.51s]  I forget what's in here.
[10815.31s -> 10816.81s]  I've never been in here.
[10816.81s -> 10818.17s]  Five dragon hearts?
[10818.57s -> 10819.69s]  How many of these do I have?
[10821.63s -> 10822.51s]  Yo, bruh.
[10822.51s -> 10827.74s]  Yo, I have 11 dragon hearts.
[10827.74s -> 10829.66s]  I could probably just go buy up the whole store.
[10833.26s -> 10837.82s]  Let's go to, you know, there's the dragon heart place on the first island.
[10837.82s -> 10839.42s]  And that like near the starter area.
[10839.42s -> 10839.66s]  Yeah.
[10840.30s -> 10841.34s]  Let's go there.
[10841.34s -> 10841.66s]  Okay.
[10843.87s -> 10846.83s]  We need to it's right over here.
[10847.47s -> 10848.81s]  It's like down on the beach.
[10849.69s -> 10850.49s]  The entrance.
[10850.49s -> 10852.41s]  I think we just go to the first step, right?
[10852.41s -> 10855.48s]  Because it's right here.
[10860.06s -> 10860.54s]  Yeah.
[10865.92s -> 10866.80s]  Do the one in Caleb.
[10866.80s -> 10867.92s]  The bigger one is in Caleb.
[10868.56s -> 10869.36s]  We've been there.
[10869.36s -> 10870.16s]  Yeah, we've already been there.
[10870.16s -> 10871.68s]  And it sold a lot of good things.
[10871.68s -> 10873.84s]  So I'm assuming this one will also sell good things.
[10874.40s -> 10876.24s]  This one will be different too, right?
[10876.24s -> 10876.80s]  Yeah.
[10876.80s -> 10881.93s]  It's doing that thing.
[10881.93s -> 10883.29s]  Really is doing that thing.
[10883.29s -> 10886.33s]  We haven't had like crashes today or a lot of disconnecting.
[10886.33s -> 10886.97s]  It's been better.
[10886.97s -> 10888.57s]  Just the voting to warp sometimes.
[10889.95s -> 10891.23s]  This is the best mod.
[10891.23s -> 10891.87s]  This really is.
[10891.87s -> 10892.99s]  It's just so good.
[10892.99s -> 10895.84s]  I just can't.
[10895.84s -> 10896.80s]  I can't believe.
[10896.80s -> 10900.51s]  I can't believe it's just, you know what I mean?
[10900.51s -> 10903.05s]  I can't believe I know what you mean.
[10903.05s -> 10904.17s]  Are you drinking pickle juice?
[10904.17s -> 10906.83s]  No.
[10907.07s -> 10908.83s]  We never killed this slob right in the beginning.
[10908.83s -> 10911.98s]  When are you going to do a face reveal?
[10911.98s -> 10916.03s]  What if I just went like there's a clay coming off
[10916.03s -> 10917.79s]  and like I pulled my nose down.
[10917.79s -> 10919.16s]  Clay, clay.
[10919.80s -> 10923.63s]  And it was I was a different face under here.
[10923.63s -> 10924.59s]  It's the same face.
[10925.77s -> 10927.61s]  Just kind of very slightly different.
[10937.77s -> 10946.35s]  Oh, this is the rock one.
[10946.35s -> 10947.47s]  I can't lock on again.
[10948.27s -> 10965.93s]  All right.
[10965.93s -> 10970.43s]  Would you laugh if one of the best items in the whole game dropped right here?
[10970.43s -> 10972.35s]  And you could have had it at the very beginning.
[10972.35s -> 10973.07s]  I would laugh.
[10973.07s -> 10973.63s]  I would laugh.
[10974.27s -> 10975.63s]  A crystal tear.
[10975.63s -> 10977.72s]  I don't even.
[10977.72s -> 10979.08s]  Strength, not crystal tear.
[10979.64s -> 10984.89s]  What are my opinions on Pilk?
[10986.97s -> 10987.45s]  Jesus.
[10988.01s -> 10988.97s]  I read that too fast.
[10991.18s -> 10991.66s]  Other way.
[10992.46s -> 10992.86s]  Friend.
[10992.86s -> 10993.50s]  Other way, friend.
[10996.38s -> 10997.34s]  Traveling to the beach.
[10997.34s -> 10998.54s]  This is our beach episode.
[11015.69s -> 11016.89s]  The beach episode.
[11022.88s -> 11025.92s]  Oh, there's one of the invisible squigglies.
[11027.40s -> 11029.32s]  Can you still do your magma jump?
[11029.32s -> 11031.00s]  I cannot, but sorry.
[11031.72s -> 11034.41s]  I mean, you should still have that in your inventory.
[11035.05s -> 11037.40s]  I don't think I don't have any faith to use it though.
[11038.62s -> 11040.14s]  Most of these are very simple.
[11040.14s -> 11041.50s]  Just some of them are just annoying.
[11041.50s -> 11044.33s]  I'll get it right here.
[11044.33s -> 11047.13s]  That was so close.
[11047.13s -> 11048.49s]  Like that was literally a frame.
[11048.49s -> 11049.13s]  Yeah, there we go.
[11052.88s -> 11053.20s]  All right.
[11053.20s -> 11054.08s]  Crash.
[11054.08s -> 11055.60s]  So how do we get over there?
[11056.24s -> 11059.42s]  We need to go this way.
[11059.42s -> 11061.74s]  It's like a weird teleporter or something, isn't it?
[11062.83s -> 11063.31s]  No.
[11063.31s -> 11064.27s]  Oh, you know, you can just walk.
[11064.27s -> 11065.07s]  You can just walk.
[11065.07s -> 11066.51s]  There's a cave that goes under.
[11067.39s -> 11073.56s]  You got to go in the cave and battle the dwellers of the deep.
[11075.95s -> 11077.07s]  Oh, the buck cave.
[11077.07s -> 11078.03s]  Yeah, that's true.
[11079.55s -> 11079.79s]  Yeah.
[11079.79s -> 11081.31s]  Amadeus is in there.
[11081.31s -> 11082.51s]  Big hand boss.
[11082.51s -> 11083.47s]  Just hanging out over here.
[11088.20s -> 11089.48s]  There's a merchant up here.
[11089.48s -> 11091.48s]  I'm going to go see if he's got any cool items.
[11091.48s -> 11095.08s]  I would, you know, it'd be more disappointing to see if this guy actually was selling like
[11097.13s -> 11098.25s]  something ridiculous.
[11098.25s -> 11098.49s]  Yeah.
[11104.03s -> 11107.31s]  I mean, he does sell smithing stone 456 for me.
[11113.74s -> 11115.58s]  I think I was going to buy like a million of these.
[11122.43s -> 11123.55s]  Rose and needle.
[11123.55s -> 11124.43s]  What is this thing?
[11126.76s -> 11128.20s]  That's a fun weapon.
[11128.20s -> 11132.84s]  I think it's a rapier that like shoots a ice projectile.
[11133.56s -> 11143.88s]  I'm going to buy it and I'm going to buy a hundred and four of these.
[11144.52s -> 11147.23s]  Of what?
[11148.19s -> 11149.79s]  I have like little poison things now.
[11150.51s -> 11152.06s]  Hold on.
[11152.06s -> 11155.31s]  Okay, that sounds really cool.
[11156.73s -> 11157.85s]  That sounds incredible.
[11158.49s -> 11159.95s]  They scale with strength.
[11162.99s -> 11164.43s]  I'm going to kill him while you're talking.
[11164.43s -> 11164.83s]  Don't.
[11164.83s -> 11166.19s]  This guy has awesome shit for me.
[11166.19s -> 11166.59s]  Don't do it.
[11170.04s -> 11170.36s]  Why?
[11170.36s -> 11172.52s]  Oh, yeah, I can take the better the bell bearing.
[11173.24s -> 11177.48s]  Why do you want to?
[11177.48s -> 11179.24s]  Why do you want to kill these guys?
[11181.05s -> 11182.41s]  What's wrong with you?
[11182.41s -> 11182.81s]  I don't.
[11182.81s -> 11183.69s]  I just want to go in the cave.
[11185.37s -> 11186.49s]  It's holding you up.
[11186.49s -> 11188.97s]  I know, but I need to put this on my bar because now I have
[11188.97s -> 11191.93s]  I have like 200 fucking poison like darts.
[11193.74s -> 11195.82s]  I got 200 poison snowballs.
[11195.82s -> 11202.40s]  Oh, watch out.
[11202.40s -> 11203.28s]  It's pretty dark down here.
[11211.60s -> 11213.12s]  Now all merchants are hostile.
[11215.72s -> 11216.44s]  Okay.
[11216.44s -> 11218.54s]  That's like that's cute.
[11218.54s -> 11220.30s]  They think they think they can take us.
[11224.92s -> 11225.16s]  All right.
[11225.16s -> 11229.87s]  What do I got here?
[11229.87s -> 11236.59s]  Boys charged attacks.
[11242.49s -> 11243.05s]  What?
[11243.05s -> 11246.25s]  This guy's on the ground dying and he's like, oh, they're going to kill me.
[11246.25s -> 11248.25s]  I'm like, here have a golden sewing needle.
[11249.13s -> 11251.61s]  Does that make this better?
[11255.80s -> 11257.48s]  I kind of don't want to take anything off.
[11259.77s -> 11259.93s]  Good.
[11259.93s -> 11261.45s]  Now you stop complaining.
[11262.25s -> 11264.35s]  I think I'm all right now.
[11264.91s -> 11272.28s]  Don't I have the needle?
[11273.08s -> 11274.04s]  I gave it to him.
[11274.04s -> 11274.44s]  Oh, okay.
[11277.48s -> 11278.20s]  Okay.
[11278.20s -> 11284.62s]  I mean, it's kind of embarrassing.
[11284.62s -> 11287.18s]  There's like a really low level zone for him to be dying in.
[11288.14s -> 11288.94s]  All right.
[11288.94s -> 11291.98s]  Test these to see if this is worth be spending like 20,000 souls.
[11293.02s -> 11294.06s]  Don't kill the guy over there.
[11296.92s -> 11297.56s]  What the hell?
[11298.12s -> 11304.89s]  This is like a fucking mess.
[11305.53s -> 11310.16s]  I don't know what just happened.
[11313.79s -> 11315.39s]  A swift glint stone shard.
[11315.39s -> 11317.79s]  I know I don't do magic, but that's pretty good one.
[11318.94s -> 11319.98s]  What the fuck?
[11319.98s -> 11323.84s]  Where are they?
[11326.04s -> 11327.32s]  Oh, shit trio.
[11327.32s -> 11330.12s]  That's kind of funny because there's normally like a bunch of guys here.
[11344.57s -> 11346.33s]  These guys are so parryable by the way.
[11346.97s -> 11347.69s]  Mr. Perry.
[11349.12s -> 11349.36s]  Yeah.
[11350.56s -> 11352.72s]  I don't have like my weapon doesn't really hurt them.
[11353.60s -> 11357.26s]  Oh, I don't I don't have a parry shield.
[11361.45s -> 11364.17s]  The other one's just like spinning in the corner.
[11365.29s -> 11369.15s]  She gave me scarlet rot.
[11370.04s -> 11370.36s]  Yep.
[11375.24s -> 11375.80s]  Please hold.
[11389.63s -> 11390.51s]  Break.
[11390.51s -> 11392.03s]  Do the noise.
[11392.91s -> 11393.55s]  Oh, you mean that?
[11398.57s -> 11401.05s]  Yeah, I don't know how I hurt them.
[11402.57s -> 11404.73s]  It's pretty much you have to parry them or use one.
[11405.69s -> 11410.67s]  That's what I mean.
[11410.67s -> 11414.51s]  I don't put on a parry shield, but now this one is unparryable.
[11415.31s -> 11418.75s]  It's kind of like a you like this is like where your character art starts to shine.
[11419.39s -> 11420.91s]  I'm doing pretty well.
[11426.12s -> 11428.52s]  I think you can hurt them now.
[11429.40s -> 11433.68s]  I think once like they get like broken up or something.
[11433.68s -> 11433.92s]  Yeah.
[11440.38s -> 11442.06s]  Oh, commoners headband.
[11442.86s -> 11444.86s]  Sombra ancient dragon smithing stone.
[11444.86s -> 11446.78s]  Oh, I got an ant skull shield.
[11449.08s -> 11449.96s]  That's kind of weird.
[11453.76s -> 11454.96s]  Ant skull plate.
[11455.60s -> 11459.10s]  Look at this thing.
[11459.92s -> 11463.71s]  No, look at this thing.
[11463.71s -> 11464.43s]  Look at where this is.
[11464.43s -> 11465.55s]  No, no.
[11466.43s -> 11467.47s]  Look at where this is.
[11467.47s -> 11471.95s]  Come here where I'm trying to go to the dragon temple.
[11477.64s -> 11479.00s]  I won't look at it.
[11479.00s -> 11479.56s]  I won't look.
[11484.09s -> 11484.65s]  Don't exit.
[11484.65s -> 11485.29s]  Don't exit.
[11485.29s -> 11485.77s]  Don't exit.
[11485.77s -> 11486.17s]  Don't exit.
[11486.17s -> 11486.65s]  Don't exit.
[11488.30s -> 11493.82s]  They put that there to trick you like having blinked in a while.
[11498.25s -> 11498.81s]  Give it a try.
[11499.37s -> 11503.47s]  Okay.
[11503.47s -> 11504.67s]  Great stars.
[11504.67s -> 11515.42s]  Ooh, don't kill it.
[11515.42s -> 11516.14s]  Dude, come on.
[11516.14s -> 11519.56s]  I don't think we could have walked by.
[11520.20s -> 11521.64s]  He could jump over his legs.
[11522.20s -> 11539.34s]  Isn't there an invasion here too?
[11540.49s -> 11541.05s]  Yeah, maybe.
[11548.57s -> 11548.97s]  I didn't.
[11549.53s -> 11550.33s]  Oh, no.
[11553.76s -> 11554.08s]  All right.
[11554.08s -> 11556.00s]  Hey guys, mind if I invade you?
[11556.64s -> 11559.66s]  That's like my favorite animal in Elden Ring.
[11560.38s -> 11561.18s]  Why did I do that?
[11563.61s -> 11564.49s]  Yeah, it's kind of suck.
[11568.96s -> 11570.00s]  Elden stars.
[11571.79s -> 11572.35s]  Great heal.
[11573.07s -> 11575.31s]  I mean, I feel like I should just get it.
[11575.95s -> 11578.43s]  I don't buy like 11 of these.
[11579.07s -> 11579.63s]  Buy everything.
[11582.25s -> 11584.09s]  You can sell Jerma anything.
[11584.09s -> 11585.53s]  Just put it in front of him.
[11586.70s -> 11590.46s]  I mean, this is the only place you can spend this currency.
[11590.46s -> 11593.98s]  I have 11 of them and I can't spend it anywhere else.
[11593.98s -> 11594.94s]  So might as well get it.
[11597.37s -> 11598.25s]  You make a good point.
[11598.81s -> 11602.22s]  I forgot that they're like selling these based on like made up currency.
[11602.22s -> 11603.90s]  It is just a made up currency.
[11603.90s -> 11604.78s]  It's not runes.
[11604.78s -> 11606.86s]  It's just dragon hearts, which I have a ton of.
[11607.58s -> 11609.34s]  And there's only six items in the game.
[11609.34s -> 11610.46s]  I have 11 hearts.
[11611.50s -> 11616.52s]  I have a four or at least four or five surplus of hearts.
[11616.52s -> 11617.16s]  I have one.
[11621.12s -> 11625.23s]  OK, so we're going to the we're going to the.
[11650.14s -> 11651.42s]  This area is too blue.
[11653.55s -> 11654.67s]  I wish they would redo it.
[11655.88s -> 11657.64s]  Hey, how do you go down to?
[11658.76s -> 11661.24s]  You know, we're all like the scarlet rot swamp is.
[11662.04s -> 11662.28s]  Yes.
[11663.16s -> 11664.60s]  Where is that entrance?
[11664.60s -> 11665.88s]  It's underground.
[11665.88s -> 11668.12s]  It's part of the quest line for Ronnie.
[11669.39s -> 11675.23s]  And from my understanding, you need to go there from not wrong.
[11679.07s -> 11685.74s]  Almost just walked off the edge looking at chat in my fault.
[11686.68s -> 11688.04s]  I don't know why I'm following you.
[11688.84s -> 11689.72s]  I know where I'm going.
[11695.88s -> 11696.84s]  Where are you going?
[11697.85s -> 11699.13s]  I know where I'm going.
[11699.13s -> 11699.92s]  We should get that.
[11699.92s -> 11700.64s]  We got to get the map.
[11707.84s -> 11708.64s]  I know where I'm going.
[11713.40s -> 11714.68s]  That old man had it coming.
[11721.39s -> 11725.05s]  Jesus, I make like a jump scare noise for you.
[11726.01s -> 11728.17s]  No, it's just kind of right in my face.
[11728.89s -> 11733.98s]  Like when he attacked, it was like, um, uh,
[11733.98s -> 11736.62s]  I think that's like the you are going to get knocked off your horse sound.
[11736.62s -> 11743.74s]  The first mark of death.
[11743.74s -> 11747.95s]  Oh, I think that's the thing to do the boss with via, isn't it?
[11748.75s -> 11749.95s]  I think I have that.
[11749.95s -> 11751.55s]  My cat was telling me we could do that earlier.
[11751.55s -> 11755.58s]  And then I said, cool, we did some else.
[11761.98s -> 11769.60s]  Don't even do this to me.
[11769.60s -> 11770.16s]  Oh, that's right.
[11770.16s -> 11771.76s]  These things, these dumb beetles don't give anything.
[11780.52s -> 11782.28s]  Uh, boss man.
[11782.28s -> 11786.44s]  Yeah, so there's usually a, um, some of those, um,
[11786.44s -> 11788.88s]  I get the wave, you spin it around.
[11788.88s -> 11789.84s]  They look like a gargoyle.
[11807.40s -> 11809.32s]  Now, what a fool I am.
[11809.32s -> 11811.88s]  I hit him in his elbow, but he has elbow guards on.
[11812.52s -> 11813.64s]  That was actually really dumb.
[11814.52s -> 11818.36s]  Oops.
[11818.36s -> 11825.53s]  You want to end it?
[11827.16s -> 11827.72s]  Go for it.
[11828.89s -> 11829.53s]  And twist.
[11832.83s -> 11834.99s]  God, I'm so freaking cool.
[11838.46s -> 11839.02s]  Oh my God.
[11839.02s -> 11840.22s]  72,000.
[11840.22s -> 11844.01s]  Very good.
[11845.40s -> 11847.08s]  Map fragment is right here.
[11850.24s -> 11851.20s]  Up over this.
[11851.92s -> 11855.40s]  Let us gamble.
[11855.40s -> 11858.20s]  There's no time to gamble when we just destroy it really quickly.
[11858.20s -> 11868.65s]  It's like a little map.
[11868.65s -> 11885.69s]  I need to level up.
[11885.69s -> 11886.57s]  Is 45 enough?
[11886.57s -> 11887.45s]  I should have do 50.
[11895.96s -> 11897.08s]  45 is not enough.
[11897.08s -> 11901.82s]  Do what they say.
[11901.82s -> 11906.30s]  Is, isn't there a, is the, what's the cap for, um, for vigor?
[11906.30s -> 11907.74s]  Is it 60?
[11907.74s -> 11908.62s]  Oh, that's right.
[11908.62s -> 11909.18s]  I keep forgetting.
[11909.18s -> 11911.26s]  I thought it was, I keep thinking that's 40.
[11911.26s -> 11912.06s]  Do what they say.
[11918.22s -> 11918.62s]  I did.
[11920.01s -> 11920.57s]  Come on.
[11924.14s -> 11925.66s]  60 is the true cap.
[11926.14s -> 11932.20s]  Who do you think is going to be in the Giants area?
[11936.84s -> 11943.72s]  Uh, how could I possibly know the answer to that question?
[11943.72s -> 11945.24s]  I think it's going to be an ulcerated tree spirit.
[11946.04s -> 11947.88s]  You say that for every single one.
[11947.88s -> 11950.20s]  And one of these times it's going to be right.
[11950.20s -> 11952.20s]  Oh, he knew, he knew.
[11952.20s -> 11953.00s]  It's Radon.
[11953.00s -> 11955.16s]  I'm going to say Radon every time because we still haven't seen him.
[11968.78s -> 11969.18s]  That's right.
[11969.18s -> 11969.82s]  It could be Radon.
[11969.82s -> 11971.26s]  If it is Radon, that's actually not good.
[11971.82s -> 11973.82s]  It's going to be a super scaled Radon.
[11974.38s -> 11976.54s]  This guy's covering his face because of how ugly he is.
[11977.10s -> 11978.22s]  Oh, he ruined it.
[11988.32s -> 11989.12s]  Oh, yeah.
[11989.12s -> 11990.72s]  Our clothing is different.
[11990.72s -> 11992.72s]  His head's like a mushroom fungus for me.
[11994.24s -> 11995.60s]  His head is still covered in mine too.
[11999.68s -> 12007.93s]  Oh wait, he goes, let chaos take the world.
[12007.93s -> 12009.13s]  This guy's messed up.
[12009.13s -> 12010.09s]  I say we take him out.
[12011.77s -> 12012.27s]  Hold on.
[12022.14s -> 12022.64s]  Hold on.
[12027.64s -> 12029.58s]  May chaos take.
[12032.91s -> 12033.55s]  There it is.
[12033.55s -> 12034.03s]  He said it.
[12037.92s -> 12038.72s]  Okay.
[12038.72s -> 12040.36s]  Is there a maybe a boss down here?
[12067.07s -> 12068.27s]  Where is it?
[12072.27s -> 12072.75s]  I don't know.
[12073.69s -> 12075.45s]  Oh, smithing stone seven.
[12075.45s -> 12075.93s]  Yes.
[12075.93s -> 12077.53s]  That means you can upgrade one of these.
[12079.61s -> 12080.25s]  Here's the hole.
[12088.54s -> 12089.34s]  Open it, peasant.
[12093.56s -> 12094.12s]  What's in here?
[12094.12s -> 12094.36s]  Come on.
[12094.36s -> 12094.86s]  What is it?
[12097.08s -> 12098.04s]  Smithing stone seven.
[12098.68s -> 12100.76s]  Somber smithing stone nine.
[12100.76s -> 12105.31s]  I need that.
[12105.31s -> 12105.71s]  You want it?
[12105.71s -> 12106.35s]  I need that.
[12106.35s -> 12106.85s]  Yeah.
[12109.80s -> 12110.30s]  I can even.
[12110.92s -> 12114.08s]  Somber smithing stone nine is on the ground.
[12122.44s -> 12124.04s]  That's fantastic news.
[12125.88s -> 12127.32s]  I don't know what killed him, but he died.
[12130.49s -> 12132.09s]  Kill chaos guy.
[12137.34s -> 12140.38s]  Oh, you picked on the two Elden Lord wannabes.
[12140.38s -> 12141.82s]  The two you picked on the wrong.
[12141.82s -> 12142.62s]  You're out.
[12143.18s -> 12143.68s]  You are.
[12144.38s -> 12145.44s]  Let's go.
[12145.44s -> 12146.56s]  Let's just get this leave.
[12147.52s -> 12152.57s]  He's going to hit me.
[12153.13s -> 12154.81s]  I'll be back when I become Hokage.
[12159.88s -> 12160.68s]  You need to kill the.
[12162.24s -> 12162.96s]  Get out of the way.
[12164.52s -> 12165.02s]  Okay.
[12176.54s -> 12176.78s]  All right.
[12176.78s -> 12179.42s]  There's a dungeon down there, but there's also.
[12182.04s -> 12187.85s]  Do we have to do that awful, awful village where you run away?
[12189.63s -> 12191.55s]  It's hopefully it's random enemies.
[12191.55s -> 12194.03s]  But that's a isn't that how you get to the pallet tree?
[12194.99s -> 12197.29s]  Yeah, we ain't doing that.
[12197.85s -> 12199.21s]  I don't know if it's random enemies.
[12199.21s -> 12199.85s]  They're not.
[12199.85s -> 12201.93s]  Wait, if they're invisible still, they might.
[12202.73s -> 12205.45s]  It was randomly invisible enemies that could be even worse.
[12206.25s -> 12209.85s]  I don't know if it could be any worse than something like insta backstabbing you.
[12209.85s -> 12210.57s]  Yeah, it's true.
[12212.19s -> 12212.75s]  That's true.
[12217.24s -> 12218.28s]  They're not invisible.
[12220.56s -> 12223.76s]  You get like machine gun archers that are all on the roof.
[12223.76s -> 12225.44s]  Why would I get Botox?
[12225.44s -> 12226.80s]  Why would I get Botox for any reason?
[12227.36s -> 12233.32s]  I don't know.
[12233.32s -> 12236.84s]  It's called when you get out of the shower.
[12236.84s -> 12238.28s]  Moisturize your god damn face.
[12238.84s -> 12241.32s]  Do you moisturize when you get out?
[12241.32s -> 12242.36s]  Do you moisturize your face?
[12243.45s -> 12244.33s]  Immediately.
[12244.33s -> 12244.49s]  Right.
[12244.49s -> 12245.05s]  Do you know?
[12245.05s -> 12245.77s]  Do you actually?
[12247.13s -> 12249.53s]  I'm an avid moisturizer these days.
[12249.53s -> 12250.25s]  You very much.
[12252.76s -> 12254.52s]  Dry as heck out here.
[12254.52s -> 12258.68s]  Oh, and you're in Vegas, which I think you've been lying about, to be honest.
[12258.68s -> 12259.88s]  I just don't live here.
[12261.28s -> 12263.28s]  Yeah, I was just thinking yesterday about how...
[12263.28s -> 12264.24s]  I live in Kansas.
[12264.96s -> 12267.34s]  I was like, oh, yeah, like E3.
[12267.34s -> 12268.14s]  No, not E3.
[12269.10s -> 12269.74s]  Evo was coming.
[12269.74s -> 12270.94s]  I was like, yeah, I want to go out to Vegas.
[12270.94s -> 12273.98s]  And then I'm like, wait, I'm going to realize German doesn't actually live out there.
[12273.98s -> 12274.62s]  And he's been lying.
[12274.62s -> 12275.58s]  He's like in Europe.
[12276.70s -> 12277.90s]  That seems like something you would do.
[12284.00s -> 12284.72s]  Awfully quiet.
[12284.72s -> 12285.36s]  A couple items.
[12287.76s -> 12289.44s]  All right, dude, I keep getting spitting stone sevens.
[12289.44s -> 12290.40s]  The game knows what I want.
[12292.32s -> 12297.53s]  Well, if I was in EU, I think that all the EU viewers right now are like, nah,
[12297.53s -> 12299.45s]  nah, that's fucking not happening.
[12300.25s -> 12302.97s]  Because it's like 4 a.m. every time I turn the stream on.
[12302.97s -> 12304.17s]  That would be really strange.
[12304.97s -> 12307.87s]  I think stone seven again.
[12307.87s -> 12309.23s]  Smithing stone seven again.
[12311.84s -> 12312.64s]  Dude.
[12312.64s -> 12314.48s]  What's the odds of that actually happening, though?
[12315.04s -> 12317.20s]  What's the odds that actually happening?
[12317.20s -> 12317.92s]  That's pretty low.
[12318.91s -> 12320.03s]  Watch out, we got a bong boy.
[12321.29s -> 12322.33s]  Oh, stung beetle.
[12327.36s -> 12329.04s]  Founding Reign of Stars, mate.
[12329.04s -> 12329.76s]  Do you want to try it?
[12332.25s -> 12333.05s]  I have it already.
[12333.69s -> 12334.65s]  Founding Reign of Stars.
[12336.30s -> 12338.14s]  Yo, I also got it from that.
[12338.14s -> 12339.77s]  What are the odds of that?
[12339.77s -> 12341.58s]  Where'd you go?
[12347.58s -> 12347.98s]  Yeah, yeah.
[12349.10s -> 12351.26s]  We're going to have to do a starlight kid.
[12351.26s -> 12355.29s]  We're going to do a crap session.
[12355.29s -> 12356.57s]  A craft.
[12356.57s -> 12360.25s]  I can like upgrade my moon veil and I think I can upgrade one of your swords.
[12360.89s -> 12363.76s]  I thought you were like, hey, man, we got to really do like a crap session.
[12364.56s -> 12365.60s]  We're going to have the craps table.
[12365.60s -> 12366.40s]  I come down to Vegas.
[12366.40s -> 12367.52s]  We hit up the craps, man.
[12367.52s -> 12370.11s]  I can talk to millennial.
[12370.11s -> 12371.39s]  You can talk to millennia.
[12371.39s -> 12371.89s]  Mm hmm.
[12373.79s -> 12375.63s]  She's rent free in your head.
[12378.75s -> 12379.95s]  I've said I forgot.
[12381.15s -> 12381.65s]  No.
[12388.56s -> 12390.88s]  Yeah, you want to go to upgrade your weapon?
[12390.88s -> 12393.42s]  You just want to keep going.
[12393.42s -> 12393.98s]  Let's go through.
[12393.98s -> 12395.02s]  Let's get past the giant.
[12395.02s -> 12398.06s]  Because then once we beat giant and we burn the tree,
[12398.70s -> 12404.30s]  we kind of can decide when we want to end our playthrough.
[12404.30s -> 12404.80s]  You know what I mean?
[12405.98s -> 12409.52s]  Because after the giant, it's like, all right, what else do you really want to do?
[12409.52s -> 12412.00s]  Because we can then go right to the ear tree.
[12412.00s -> 12415.29s]  I think you just want to burn a bowl.
[12415.29s -> 12422.38s]  Hey, left or right, man?
[12422.38s -> 12427.96s]  I want the map fragment.
[12427.96s -> 12441.47s]  That would be so awful.
[12444.48s -> 12446.56s]  It's too nice, man, on horseback coming our way.
[12447.28s -> 12452.96s]  Imagine getting hit in both of your ears at the same time.
[12453.76s -> 12456.24s]  With two big ass weapons.
[12456.24s -> 12457.28s]  What is that?
[12457.28s -> 12458.24s]  I can imagine.
[12458.24s -> 12459.12s]  I've been clapped.
[12459.12s -> 12460.16s]  Have you been clapped?
[12460.16s -> 12461.20s]  Why is that on the ground?
[12461.20s -> 12465.93s]  Oh, wait, this is where you fight one of the invaders.
[12466.49s -> 12472.32s]  I can't get off the horse.
[12472.32s -> 12482.96s]  Isn't this where you fight one of the manor people?
[12483.60s -> 12486.70s]  You fight somebody from the manor here, don't you?
[12486.70s -> 12487.42s]  I don't know.
[12488.67s -> 12489.71s]  Well, I'm asking Chad.
[12490.88s -> 12492.88s]  Yeah, I have his letter.
[12492.88s -> 12500.49s]  Am I the invader?
[12500.49s -> 12500.99s]  Oh.
[12504.72s -> 12505.60s]  Watch out.
[12505.60s -> 12506.10s]  Wait, what?
[12507.06s -> 12507.70s]  Wait, hey.
[12509.52s -> 12510.24s]  Not cool.
[12510.24s -> 12510.80s]  Behind you.
[12511.84s -> 12512.64s]  I wasn't ready.
[12513.28s -> 12514.64s]  Why am I fat rolling?
[12514.64s -> 12515.92s]  I've been working with him the whole time.
[12516.96s -> 12519.36s]  Just to get you on stream, to get you here.
[12519.36s -> 12521.44s]  So we can finally, once and for all, prove to Strippin
[12521.44s -> 12522.64s]  that you're not a fucking gamer.
[12523.52s -> 12524.96s]  Strippin, let's go.
[12525.92s -> 12530.64s]  Strippin, what are you doing?
[12538.37s -> 12539.09s]  Get out of here.
[12539.73s -> 12548.14s]  I don't even know what I'm swinging at.
[12548.14s -> 12553.31s]  I feel like you still want to kill me.
[12554.64s -> 12555.28s]  Well, fine.
[12555.28s -> 12555.84s]  Fuck you.
[12555.84s -> 12556.88s]  I'll bring my own friend.
[12557.44s -> 12558.77s]  Oh, I can't.
[12566.98s -> 12567.54s]  Fuck you.
[12582.21s -> 12583.65s]  Hey, try to get a parry.
[12583.65s -> 12584.69s]  Try to get a parry.
[12584.69s -> 12585.25s]  I tried.
[12585.25s -> 12585.75s]  Ready?
[12587.90s -> 12589.50s]  It teleported me out already.
[12589.50s -> 12592.26s]  What did we even get from that?
[12592.26s -> 12595.28s]  A funny moment where we could fight each other for a minute.
[12595.84s -> 12600.40s]  Or even in the same game anymore.
[12600.40s -> 12602.98s]  I don't know.
[12604.77s -> 12606.77s]  I think that actually did break the co-op.
[12606.77s -> 12608.13s]  Because you were an invader.
[12608.13s -> 12608.63s]  Oh, I know.
[12609.81s -> 12610.53s]  Yeah.
[12613.09s -> 12613.81s]  It was for fun.
[12613.81s -> 12616.29s]  It was a funny stream moment.
[12618.11s -> 12619.23s]  And nobody won.
[12620.69s -> 12621.73s]  Actually, I think I can level up.
[12625.34s -> 12626.38s]  Wait, isn't there a...
[12627.10s -> 12629.82s]  Okay, while you rejoin, I have a quick pee-pee time.
[12629.82s -> 12638.26s]  Okay.
[12638.26s -> 12640.82s]  Okay, I think I'm stuck in limbo here.
[12640.82s -> 12641.86s]  I have to restart.
[12641.86s -> 12643.70s]  All right, yeah, we'll just do another pee break.
[12644.26s -> 12644.82s]  We'll be right back.
[12645.46s -> 12646.40s]  I'm going to restart.
[12650.37s -> 12651.01s]  Uh-oh.
[12651.01s -> 12659.68s]  I'm not really sure what to do about this.
[12659.68s -> 12663.73s]  I think I'm still in his game.
[12664.61s -> 12667.62s]  I'm ready to die.
[12688.26s -> 12689.06s]  There we go.
[12689.06s -> 12692.13s]  Wait, but am I still in his game?
[12692.13s -> 12695.04s]  No, I can't even touch the bonfires.
[12697.28s -> 12698.80s]  I have to alt-F4.
[12698.80s -> 12699.12s]  Wait.
[12699.84s -> 12700.08s]  Why?
[12700.08s -> 12700.48s]  What happened?
[12702.08s -> 12703.84s]  I'm going to lose 50,000 souls.
[12703.84s -> 12706.88s]  But I have to...
[12706.88s -> 12707.76s]  I can't even quit the game.
[12707.76s -> 12708.40s]  I have to alt-F4.
[12709.66s -> 12710.62s]  Separation missed?
[12710.62s -> 12711.66s]  I don't think I can...
[12711.66s -> 12714.22s]  I just tried to banish you if you were...
[12714.22s -> 12714.62s]  Oh, there we go.
[12714.62s -> 12715.34s]  Okay.
[12715.34s -> 12715.90s]  I think I'm good.
[12717.17s -> 12717.65s]  No.
[12717.65s -> 12718.45s]  Yeah, I got to re...
[12718.45s -> 12719.01s]  Wait.
[12719.01s -> 12719.97s]  Hold on.
[12719.97s -> 12721.01s]  I've opened my world.
[12721.01s -> 12722.45s]  I think I closed it by accident.
[12723.09s -> 12729.39s]  I think that's going to work now.
[12730.19s -> 12730.43s]  Yes.
[12730.43s -> 12730.75s]  Okay.
[12732.16s -> 12732.40s]  All right.
[12732.40s -> 12732.88s]  Did you pee?
[12733.78s -> 12734.34s]  Yeah.
[12734.34s -> 12735.06s]  All right.
[12735.06s -> 12735.78s]  It was great.
[12735.78s -> 12736.26s]  I did, too.
[12737.30s -> 12741.06s]  Did you want to buy a castle in Scotland
[12741.06s -> 12742.10s]  and we could live there together?
[12744.99s -> 12745.71s]  No.
[12745.71s -> 12746.48s]  Okay.
[12750.56s -> 12755.71s]  Oh, I got items from him dying.
[12761.20s -> 12762.32s]  We got the jump over there.
[12762.32s -> 12763.28s]  I don't know where the jumpy go.
[12763.84s -> 12767.17s]  Isn't there a bonfire right here?
[12768.32s -> 12768.56s]  Yeah.
[12768.56s -> 12769.92s]  Let's just get on our horses
[12771.15s -> 12772.43s]  right along the countryside.
[12773.15s -> 12777.06s]  Don't get me wrong.
[12777.06s -> 12778.42s]  I bet I've never been to Scotland.
[12779.58s -> 12779.90s]  Sounds...
[12780.54s -> 12781.74s]  It sounds beautiful.
[12781.74s -> 12783.02s]  It sounds like an incredible place.
[12784.14s -> 12784.38s]  But...
[12784.94s -> 12786.22s]  It's me that's the problem.
[12787.18s -> 12789.31s]  I just...
[12789.31s -> 12789.71s]  I don't know.
[12793.36s -> 12795.60s]  I feel like a bot.
[12795.60s -> 12796.48s]  No, there's no bot.
[12796.48s -> 12797.12s]  It's just like, I don't know.
[12797.12s -> 12798.56s]  I don't really know Scotland.
[12798.56s -> 12799.12s]  I like...
[12799.12s -> 12801.44s]  It feels like you're really trying to justify
[12801.44s -> 12803.28s]  not buying a castle in Scotland,
[12803.28s -> 12804.16s]  but like you...
[12804.16s -> 12804.64s]  I mean like...
[12805.44s -> 12806.40s]  I don't know.
[12806.40s -> 12808.16s]  I got to be so nice about it.
[12808.16s -> 12809.12s]  Like, no, I don't want to live
[12809.12s -> 12810.32s]  in a castle in Scotland.
[12810.32s -> 12810.80s]  Okay?
[12810.80s -> 12811.28s]  There you go.
[12811.92s -> 12812.96s]  That's the whole statement.
[12812.96s -> 12814.24s]  I don't need any more statements.
[12814.24s -> 12815.12s]  I thought that star...
[12815.12s -> 12815.68s]  Where did you go?
[12815.68s -> 12816.40s]  I was freaking out.
[12823.25s -> 12824.05s]  Oh, so we got to kill it.
[12824.05s -> 12824.61s]  Wait, what is...
[12824.61s -> 12824.85s]  I don't...
[12825.41s -> 12827.86s]  This jellyfish is underage?
[12829.39s -> 12830.03s]  What?
[12830.03s -> 12832.99s]  What are you looking at?
[12833.71s -> 12834.75s]  There's a jellyfish here
[12834.75s -> 12835.55s]  and it's like talking.
[12839.10s -> 12839.98s]  You don't see it?
[12839.98s -> 12840.22s]  No.
[12843.22s -> 12843.62s]  This gel...
[12843.62s -> 12845.54s]  No, but your chat's question marking.
[12845.54s -> 12846.74s]  The jellyfish was like...
[12846.74s -> 12847.94s]  You said when we were 14,
[12847.94s -> 12848.98s]  we'd go visit the stars.
[12849.95s -> 12851.07s]  There's an underage jellyfish here.
[12851.71s -> 12852.59s]  Not making shit up.
[12854.19s -> 12855.23s]  Don't you have to...
[12855.23s -> 12855.71s]  Wait.
[12855.71s -> 12856.27s]  Okay.
[12856.27s -> 12856.83s]  Wait, this is...
[12856.83s -> 12857.71s]  You have to give the...
[12859.15s -> 12860.35s]  Are you killing?
[12860.35s -> 12860.59s]  You...
[12861.55s -> 12862.27s]  It's gone.
[12862.27s -> 12862.59s]  That's...
[12863.39s -> 12864.11s]  I'm just saying
[12864.67s -> 12866.19s]  you killed the jellyfish
[12866.83s -> 12869.38s]  and I think that that's worse
[12869.38s -> 12870.50s]  than if you killed the turtle.
[12871.87s -> 12873.23s]  Like, I think your chat
[12873.23s -> 12874.19s]  probably is freaking out right now.
[12874.19s -> 12876.19s]  You can't prove that I killed it
[12876.19s -> 12877.23s]  because you couldn't even see it.
[12880.67s -> 12881.31s]  Pork brain.
[12883.38s -> 12884.82s]  Yeah, that's raw pork brain,
[12884.82s -> 12885.14s]  I think.
[12886.91s -> 12887.15s]  All right.
[12887.15s -> 12888.11s]  Let's keep going.
[12888.11s -> 12888.59s]  Let's get out of here.
[12888.59s -> 12890.75s]  Man, I am patient zero.
[12892.35s -> 12893.71s]  You're going to hear about me on the news.
[12898.11s -> 12898.75s]  Yeah, this is going to be...
[12898.75s -> 12900.59s]  This is going to be like a huge Reddit thread.
[12901.66s -> 12903.42s]  Like, wait, why would he have done that?
[12904.38s -> 12905.90s]  Would he eat pork
[12905.90s -> 12907.58s]  that was in a backpack for a day?
[12910.66s -> 12911.86s]  That's where COVID came from.
[12911.86s -> 12912.82s]  Was it a bet?
[12912.82s -> 12913.78s]  Why did he do that?
[12913.78s -> 12915.14s]  That seems insane to me.
[12915.70s -> 12919.65s]  It's Mithingstone 7 again.
[12921.52s -> 12922.00s]  Not me.
[12924.05s -> 12925.73s]  And then there'll be like buried down
[12925.73s -> 12926.21s]  in the thread.
[12926.21s -> 12927.09s]  There'll be somebody like,
[12927.09s -> 12928.61s]  I don't understand what the big deal is.
[12928.61s -> 12929.49s]  I've eaten that before
[12929.49s -> 12930.69s]  and I felt fucking fine.
[12931.33s -> 12934.78s]  It's got like minus 200 fucking downvotes.
[12936.96s -> 12938.64s]  I love scrolling to the bottom
[12938.64s -> 12939.76s]  and showing like seeing
[12939.76s -> 12941.60s]  the like controversial takes.
[12941.60s -> 12942.10s]  I love it.
[12948.14s -> 12948.64s]  Who?
[12949.34s -> 12949.98s]  Oh, okay.
[12950.62s -> 12951.82s]  You just hooted him?
[12951.82s -> 12953.02s]  He just looked a little lost.
[12975.34s -> 12982.14s]  Hey, Sturd, do you want to know
[12982.14s -> 12983.82s]  about my playthrough lore for me?
[12984.46s -> 12985.26s]  Your playthrough lore?
[12985.26s -> 12985.58s]  Yeah.
[12985.58s -> 12987.34s]  I first tried this boss
[12987.34s -> 12988.54s]  when I was probably 20
[12988.54s -> 12990.14s]  to 30 levels too early finding it.
[12991.57s -> 12992.77s]  I never found this boss.
[12992.77s -> 12993.33s]  Praise me.
[12993.33s -> 12993.83s]  Praise me.
[12994.61s -> 12995.81s]  There's like you fight one of these
[12995.81s -> 12997.17s]  in a basement somewhere.
[12997.17s -> 12997.49s]  Yeah.
[12997.49s -> 12999.17s]  I kept seeing people on streams fight it
[12999.17s -> 13000.69s]  and I was like, where the fuck is this?
[13000.69s -> 13001.41s]  I still don't know.
[13008.53s -> 13010.13s]  This is like an ice dragon out here, right?
[13016.22s -> 13016.46s]  Okay.
[13016.46s -> 13018.30s]  For a second, I thought I thought
[13018.30s -> 13019.82s]  all of his clothes just came off.
[13021.07s -> 13021.79s]  They kind of did.
[13024.13s -> 13025.98s]  That was fun.
[13025.98s -> 13027.63s]  I thought I got away.
[13027.63s -> 13029.79s]  You thought wrong.
[13040.53s -> 13042.29s]  I was just mashing L1.
[13042.29s -> 13043.65s]  I just didn't want to even fight this thing.
[13044.61s -> 13048.22s]  So you're like bored of Elden Ring.
[13050.26s -> 13050.90s]  You want to stop.
[13051.90s -> 13052.86s]  We're not playing tomorrow.
[13054.78s -> 13056.62s]  Can we just please go straight to Elden Beast?
[13056.62s -> 13057.82s]  Can we just end this already?
[13063.49s -> 13064.45s]  No, that's not what I said.
[13074.19s -> 13075.55s]  Yeah, I don't even want to fight this.
[13075.55s -> 13076.27s]  I'm just gonna let him kill me
[13076.27s -> 13077.55s]  because I like don't even want to fight this.
[13078.27s -> 13080.37s]  I'm just like so over this.
[13101.26s -> 13103.26s]  Dude, why are you blinding me?
[13134.19s -> 13134.91s]  Cowardly tactics.
[13135.55s -> 13136.43s]  Dude, you got the mod
[13136.43s -> 13137.87s]  that every time you get hit it does that
[13137.87s -> 13138.75s]  to like fuck with you.
[13140.29s -> 13141.01s]  He's gonna kill me.
[13141.57s -> 13145.55s]  You're good.
[13146.11s -> 13152.90s]  Would you smoke a blunt
[13152.90s -> 13154.18s]  with the godskin apostle?
[13154.18s -> 13156.22s]  No, no, no way.
[13156.86s -> 13158.62s]  This is the type you smoke a blunt
[13158.62s -> 13159.34s]  with this motherfucker
[13159.34s -> 13161.42s]  and they start like talking about wacky shit.
[13163.90s -> 13166.70s]  Like, hey, do you think that we should like ever,
[13166.70s -> 13167.98s]  you know, like, like,
[13167.98s -> 13169.66s]  I think we're gonna live on the moon.
[13169.66s -> 13170.86s]  It's like, I don't think,
[13170.86s -> 13171.50s]  I don't know about that.
[13173.89s -> 13175.49s]  Yeah, when they sign people up
[13175.49s -> 13176.21s]  to go live on the moon,
[13176.21s -> 13177.01s]  I'll be the first one.
[13178.85s -> 13179.89s]  I love that you're quoting
[13179.89s -> 13182.45s]  a real conversation that we had with the one we did.
[13184.48s -> 13185.44s]  Don't remember.
[13185.44s -> 13186.88s]  We had like a taxi driver.
[13187.84s -> 13189.28s]  I mean, we're leaving Seattle
[13190.08s -> 13191.60s]  from like past west.
[13191.60s -> 13192.96s]  This is a real thing.
[13192.96s -> 13194.80s]  This is a real bit, dude.
[13194.80s -> 13196.40s]  Hey, I got an ancient,
[13196.40s -> 13197.84s]  ancient dragon smithing stone, by the way.
[13197.84s -> 13198.72s]  You were looking for one of those.
[13199.52s -> 13200.80s]  This guy was talking about
[13200.80s -> 13202.64s]  sending all of the prisoners
[13202.64s -> 13204.56s]  from earth to the moon to colonize it,
[13204.56s -> 13205.60s]  just like Australia.
[13207.06s -> 13208.58s]  We were in a 30 minute conversation
[13208.58s -> 13209.22s]  with this guy.
[13209.22s -> 13209.86s]  What?
[13209.86s -> 13210.98s]  I don't remember any of this.
[13215.49s -> 13216.37s]  What the fuck?
[13216.93s -> 13219.33s]  He's no, we didn't smoke a blunt
[13219.33s -> 13221.01s]  with our taxi driver.
[13221.01s -> 13221.81s]  No, no, no, no.
[13222.77s -> 13224.53s]  He's just years ago.
[13225.73s -> 13226.85s]  I don't know.
[13226.85s -> 13227.81s]  Where are you sure it was you?
[13227.81s -> 13229.01s]  I don't know who else would be there with me.
[13229.73s -> 13230.61s]  Can you set it a bonfire?
[13234.82s -> 13238.85s]  Like enough time has gone by
[13238.85s -> 13240.61s]  that you don't think that guy's crazy anymore.
[13241.84s -> 13243.36s]  You came up with that idea.
[13243.36s -> 13244.00s]  I'm like, wait, what?
[13244.00s -> 13245.20s]  What's weird about that?
[13245.20s -> 13246.24s]  I was describing it
[13246.24s -> 13247.36s]  as if it was very weird
[13247.36s -> 13248.56s]  because I didn't want to smoke a blunt
[13248.56s -> 13249.76s]  with the godskin apostle
[13249.76s -> 13250.64s]  because he was going to start talking
[13250.64s -> 13252.08s]  about weird shit like that.
[13255.26s -> 13257.10s]  I was describing how it was weird.
[13257.66s -> 13258.75s]  Okay.
[13258.75s -> 13261.73s]  Where's there's bonfire?
[13261.73s -> 13262.13s]  I don't know.
[13265.18s -> 13266.86s]  It was the godskin apostle.
[13268.50s -> 13269.38s]  I don't know where I am.
[13270.10s -> 13270.42s]  Yeah.
[13270.42s -> 13271.94s]  And it's like somebody cut us off
[13272.66s -> 13274.42s]  and he did like they got in front of us
[13274.42s -> 13275.70s]  and they were like four cars in front of us
[13275.70s -> 13276.98s]  and he did like the fucking weird
[13276.98s -> 13278.90s]  gumby snake move went out of his window
[13278.90s -> 13280.10s]  and went in front of the guy's car
[13280.10s -> 13281.62s]  and gave the double middle finger to him.
[13282.18s -> 13283.94s]  Like in his windshield, like in front of him.
[13285.49s -> 13287.33s]  Then he went, he came back in the window
[13287.33s -> 13288.53s]  and he was like, sorry about that.
[13288.53s -> 13289.44s]  It's weird.
[13289.44s -> 13291.28s]  You don't remember any of this until now.
[13292.00s -> 13292.16s]  Yeah.
[13292.16s -> 13293.28s]  It's weird that I didn't remember that
[13293.28s -> 13294.16s]  till right now.
[13294.16s -> 13297.81s]  You just want to watch me run around on a horse?
[13298.93s -> 13300.29s]  You should live on the moon.
[13301.90s -> 13302.78s]  No, I'm serious.
[13302.78s -> 13303.98s]  No, I'm serious.
[13303.98s -> 13311.52s]  It's like I need direction.
[13311.52s -> 13313.36s]  Yeah, we should definitely go live on the moon.
[13314.72s -> 13315.92s]  Yeah, dude, we should.
[13315.92s -> 13317.04s]  I'm serious about this.
[13317.76s -> 13319.54s]  Okay.
[13327.90s -> 13328.78s]  I can't look at my map.
[13328.78s -> 13329.82s]  I have to wait till
[13329.82s -> 13332.46s]  am I going to just show up where I died?
[13332.46s -> 13333.26s]  I see one.
[13333.90s -> 13340.78s]  Jerma, you would definitely want to go move to a castle
[13340.78s -> 13342.78s]  on the moon with stir
[13342.78s -> 13344.46s]  and you guys would make it rain
[13344.46s -> 13346.22s]  and you'd be able to, like a boss,
[13346.22s -> 13348.62s]  be able to do where is that we're going with this?
[13351.78s -> 13353.70s]  Every day in our content castle.
[13355.22s -> 13356.50s]  It's every day, bro.
[13357.38s -> 13359.06s]  I wouldn't want to live in a content castle
[13359.06s -> 13359.86s]  because you know what would happen?
[13360.67s -> 13362.59s]  One of us would be loud
[13362.59s -> 13365.15s]  and it would just bounce off of every wall in the castle
[13365.15s -> 13367.95s]  and it would be un-fucking-bearable.
[13367.95s -> 13369.71s]  You'd hear yourself for a week.
[13370.19s -> 13370.83s]  It would just be like,
[13372.83s -> 13374.27s]  it'd be like, I can't fucking stand it.
[13374.27s -> 13376.75s]  All these like stone walls, whatever the hell it is.
[13378.06s -> 13378.46s]  Okay.
[13378.46s -> 13379.66s]  I need to, where are you?
[13380.99s -> 13382.11s]  At the bonfire.
[13384.21s -> 13386.53s]  I went across the bridge to the bonfire.
[13387.09s -> 13388.45s]  Where the fuck are you?
[13389.09s -> 13390.21s]  Find a warfare.
[13390.21s -> 13391.41s]  I need my souls though.
[13392.62s -> 13394.30s]  It was like 140,000.
[13394.30s -> 13395.66s]  There was a lot of souls.
[13395.66s -> 13398.72s]  I'll bet you teleported anyway.
[13398.72s -> 13401.33s]  Well, I think it's closed.
[13401.33s -> 13401.89s]  Whatever.
[13401.89s -> 13405.31s]  Would you smoke a blunt with Peter Griffin?
[13405.31s -> 13410.38s]  You asking?
[13410.38s -> 13412.06s]  I mean, I'm just bringing it up.
[13412.06s -> 13413.54s]  Somebody brought it up.
[13413.54s -> 13413.86s]  Okay.
[13415.14s -> 13418.50s]  I mean, well, hold on.
[13418.50s -> 13421.38s]  Is Peter Griffin in my house?
[13421.38s -> 13424.38s]  Like, is it like, okay, we're like hanging out at my place?
[13424.38s -> 13427.90s]  Because the answer is no.
[13427.90s -> 13428.78s]  Because Peter will probably be like,
[13428.78s -> 13432.54s]  oh yeah, so I can like stay here now.
[13432.54s -> 13434.62s]  I'll be here for like a few weeks.
[13434.62s -> 13435.10s]  Like, no.
[13435.82s -> 13436.14s]  Uh-oh.
[13438.72s -> 13439.36s]  Where did you go?
[13439.92s -> 13442.32s]  I'm trying to like show you where your souls are.
[13442.32s -> 13443.04s]  Stay here overnight.
[13443.84s -> 13445.15s]  You gotta go.
[13448.72s -> 13451.28s]  My souls are by that urn tree.
[13452.18s -> 13452.82s]  Yes.
[13452.82s -> 13453.70s]  Across the bridge.
[13454.34s -> 13455.70s]  You have to go across the bridge.
[13456.74s -> 13460.51s]  Are you checking out?
[13460.51s -> 13461.15s]  Peter, you can...
[13461.15s -> 13462.11s]  No, I'm fine.
[13462.67s -> 13464.43s]  Peter, you can stay on the futon tonight,
[13464.43s -> 13466.11s]  but then like you gotta get the fuck out of here.
[13479.42s -> 13481.66s]  Why is the godskin apostle back?
[13484.51s -> 13485.15s]  Is he?
[13485.15s -> 13485.47s]  Yeah.
[13486.19s -> 13489.81s]  I don't see him.
[13489.81s -> 13491.41s]  You don't see the apostle?
[13492.21s -> 13492.45s]  No.
[13495.04s -> 13497.68s]  I see you dealing damage to invisible nothing.
[13498.24s -> 13498.96s]  This is weird.
[13499.68s -> 13502.22s]  All right, well, get your runes.
[13503.02s -> 13508.72s]  And then we're going to go somewhere else.
[13509.28s -> 13511.84s]  All right, let's get out of here quick.
[13513.74s -> 13516.21s]  I'm not saying I couldn't handle it.
[13516.21s -> 13517.25s]  I just don't want to handle it.
[13517.81s -> 13521.41s]  You don't want to handle Peter Griffin.
[13521.97s -> 13526.77s]  Yeah, two weeks later, he's in his underwear with a 12-pack on your front.
[13526.77s -> 13527.76s]  That's what I mean.
[13528.48s -> 13535.58s]  And then he would like request really specific snacks, right?
[13535.58s -> 13538.38s]  And he'd be like, god damn it, Peter Griffin family guy shit.
[13538.38s -> 13542.54s]  He'd be like, hey, remember those slim jims that were spicy back in the 90s?
[13542.54s -> 13544.30s]  You gotta go find me some of those.
[13544.30s -> 13547.02s]  And it's like, oh, he's making a reference to something old.
[13548.74s -> 13549.06s]  Wow.
[13549.06s -> 13550.34s]  That's something you would never do.
[13559.52s -> 13560.00s]  Yeah.
[13560.00s -> 13562.08s]  Can you even go make maybe some clam chowder?
[13563.04s -> 13570.62s]  Peter, that takes all day.
[13573.62s -> 13578.98s]  No, he's crashing at our castle in Scotland.
[13583.23s -> 13584.43s]  OK, we need to go.
[13584.43s -> 13585.63s]  I need to sit down on the bonfire.
[13586.19s -> 13587.23s]  I think we went backwards.
[13587.23s -> 13587.71s]  I don't.
[13587.71s -> 13588.19s]  I'm lost.
[13588.75s -> 13590.61s]  This is definitely backwards.
[13591.17s -> 13592.69s]  We need to go.
[13592.69s -> 13593.25s]  We were.
[13593.97s -> 13595.65s]  All right, let me let me go spend these, please.
[13600.19s -> 13600.59s]  Sit down.
[13600.59s -> 13601.63s]  Let me spend it.
[13601.63s -> 13602.67s]  We did a full circle.
[13603.55s -> 13605.07s]  Well, we were talking that happened.
[13605.07s -> 13607.79s]  Well, let's let's teleport to the ancient snow valley,
[13607.79s -> 13612.59s]  worm runes or some teleport somewhere where it's it's right here.
[13614.72s -> 13617.52s]  Teleporting the loading screen would take longer for us just to walk here.
[13617.52s -> 13618.96s]  I didn't know it was right here.
[13618.96s -> 13620.32s]  Come on, man.
[13620.32s -> 13621.60s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[13621.60s -> 13622.56s]  Wait, what?
[13622.56s -> 13623.04s]  Hold on.
[13623.04s -> 13624.24s]  Wait, it's underneath us.
[13625.41s -> 13630.37s]  Oh, turns out it wasn't right here.
[13631.63s -> 13634.59s]  Someone's got an egg face, egg face.
[13634.59s -> 13637.79s]  The correct way to go is I forget the correct way to go.
[13637.79s -> 13641.60s]  There's a mogul like where's the big crucible thing?
[13642.16s -> 13644.62s]  That's the direction we need to go that way.
[13644.62s -> 13644.94s]  I think.
[13652.29s -> 13653.65s]  Wait, isn't there a teleporter here?
[13655.12s -> 13658.80s]  There's a teleporter down somewhere like right around here, isn't there?
[13659.36s -> 13661.44s]  I don't remember.
[13662.00s -> 13665.90s]  It definitely is not here.
[13666.14s -> 13671.33s]  Okay, we got to go that way that way.
[13672.37s -> 13673.65s]  I found the big cup.
[13676.85s -> 13677.33s]  Follow me.
[13679.41s -> 13681.41s]  I am going to you.
[13683.02s -> 13683.26s]  Yep.
[13683.26s -> 13684.54s]  There's the big yes, commander.
[13685.10s -> 13697.22s]  You're the smoke of one with Homer.
[13697.22s -> 13700.88s]  No, I'd rather smoke a blunt with Marge like Marge would be way chiller.
[13701.60s -> 13707.25s]  I just got half health.
[13707.25s -> 13708.61s]  Where did this guy come from?
[13709.17s -> 13711.50s]  What was he following us?
[13712.48s -> 13713.28s]  He's invisible to me.
[13713.92s -> 13714.64s]  This is all you.
[13715.52s -> 13716.16s]  Never mind.
[13716.16s -> 13717.04s]  He got full health again.
[13717.04s -> 13718.96s]  All right, we got to let's we got to go.
[13719.92s -> 13720.80s]  Can we make this jump?
[13721.60s -> 13722.00s]  No way.
[13723.22s -> 13723.86s]  All the way around.
[13724.98s -> 13725.70s]  I'm going down.
[13726.26s -> 13727.30s]  No, no, no, no, don't.
[13727.30s -> 13728.26s]  I can't.
[13728.26s -> 13729.30s]  I'm already committed.
[13729.30s -> 13730.34s]  You've committed already.
[13730.34s -> 13731.38s]  Are you serious, dude?
[13731.38s -> 13732.58s]  There's no way back up.
[13732.58s -> 13732.98s]  What do you mean?
[13732.98s -> 13733.94s]  There's no way back up.
[13734.50s -> 13736.42s]  You went can't fucking jump up a cliff.
[13737.14s -> 13740.94s]  We need to go that way.
[13741.66s -> 13742.86s]  Tell me where I need to go again.
[13743.50s -> 13745.26s]  You're going to find my hands in your jaw.
[13747.60s -> 13749.04s]  In like, yeah.
[13749.44s -> 13750.40s]  What do you?
[13750.40s -> 13752.56s]  Yeah, like I'm going to put my hand in your mouth.
[13752.56s -> 13753.60s]  Is he going the wrong way?
[13755.81s -> 13756.93s]  He's not going the right way, is he?
[13763.25s -> 13763.73s]  I don't know.
[13763.73s -> 13764.77s]  He's going the right way.
[13764.77s -> 13767.41s]  We just went in circles for like 20 minutes.
[13767.41s -> 13768.69s]  I just figured anywhere else.
[13768.69s -> 13770.61s]  I'm going to fucking die trying to do what you just did.
[13772.45s -> 13773.73s]  There's a there's a thing up here.
[13773.73s -> 13776.05s]  You can teleport to me if you dare.
[13776.05s -> 13777.41s]  Let me prove that I can do this.
[13780.77s -> 13783.09s]  Yeah, and then this is the giant frozen lake
[13783.09s -> 13784.85s]  and you go across and then the dragon's like.
[13785.01s -> 13794.74s]  Well, thanks to you, I lost like 4000 viewers, by the way,
[13794.74s -> 13797.22s]  because of shit like that because because of me.
[13798.02s -> 13799.42s]  Oh, well, guess what?
[13799.42s -> 13800.38s]  They all came over here.
[13805.18s -> 13808.78s]  You're doing like Peter Griffin impression traders because of you.
[13809.50s -> 13815.87s]  All right.
[13815.87s -> 13817.15s]  Thank God I can level up.
[13823.46s -> 13824.98s]  Can somebody help me?
[13824.98s -> 13825.94s]  Why can I?
[13825.94s -> 13827.70s]  Why did I lose access to leveling?
[13833.26s -> 13834.06s]  I don't know.
[13834.06s -> 13836.08s]  That doesn't sound right.
[13838.70s -> 13840.70s]  Maybe stuff still messed up for when you were an invader.
[13854.75s -> 13861.65s]  I think I think my game is a little messed up.
[13862.45s -> 13862.93s]  Delete it.
[13866.14s -> 13870.46s]  I have I cannot level up, so I'm just going to restart.
[13870.46s -> 13872.06s]  I'm going to restart the game.
[13872.06s -> 13872.62s]  I'm banishing.
[13873.63s -> 13874.83s]  Yeah, you know what?
[13874.83s -> 13876.27s]  No, don't even I'm just going to quit.
[13876.27s -> 13876.99s]  I'm going to exit.
[13877.55s -> 13879.06s]  I can't even exit the game.
[13879.06s -> 13880.50s]  It's been a problem ever since.
[13880.50s -> 13881.46s]  OK, all right.
[13881.46s -> 13882.10s]  Did you banish?
[13882.74s -> 13884.34s]  Yeah, all right.
[13885.14s -> 13888.66s]  For some reason, it doesn't let you exit the game if you're in co-op.
[13888.66s -> 13890.42s]  It really doesn't like the fact that I was an invader.
[13890.42s -> 13898.86s]  I think it broke it.
[13898.86s -> 13899.50s]  There it is.
[13899.50s -> 13900.14s]  OK, let me.
[13905.30s -> 13906.78s]  Why am I just leveling up?
[13906.78s -> 13912.99s]  OK, can you put the thing down again?
[13914.19s -> 13914.83s]  All right.
[13932.88s -> 13934.72s]  Come on, I need to get to 58.
[13935.76s -> 13936.40s]  Come on.
[13946.02s -> 13947.22s]  Dude, you have star muted.
[13947.22s -> 13948.10s]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[13950.85s -> 13954.53s]  He's got to learn that he has to his behavior has to improve.
[13954.53s -> 13955.17s]  Wait in line.
[13955.97s -> 13959.78s]  I am not you're not muted.
[13959.78s -> 13961.86s]  I'm just trying to level up in case it happens again.
[13962.58s -> 13966.88s]  Is your thing?
[13967.92s -> 13970.99s]  I'm using maybe it's messed up because it's not Monday
[13970.99s -> 13972.35s]  and we were supposed to play on Monday.
[13972.35s -> 13972.59s]  Shit.
[13972.59s -> 13973.15s]  That's right.
[13973.15s -> 13973.55s]  All right.
[13973.55s -> 13974.19s]  Is your thing down?
[13975.17s -> 13975.41s]  Yeah.
[13994.34s -> 13996.66s]  Let's see what the dragon is.
[13996.66s -> 13999.42s]  I don't know if we can find it.
[13999.42s -> 14002.30s]  I don't because normally this area would turn into like a mist.
[14002.30s -> 14003.98s]  I think we have to actually walk over here.
[14016.48s -> 14016.80s]  Hit him.
[14017.68s -> 14018.08s]  Hit him.
[14018.08s -> 14018.80s]  Hit him again.
[14018.80s -> 14019.44s]  Keep hitting him.
[14024.19s -> 14025.23s]  It is the dragon.
[14025.47s -> 14029.71s]  I think it's just the ice dragon going to fight it.
[14032.19s -> 14033.23s]  Guess we have to.
[14036.11s -> 14037.07s]  Maybe it's a different dragon.
[14037.63s -> 14041.87s]  I can't see anything.
[14042.75s -> 14044.03s]  Is this the right one?
[14044.03s -> 14044.53s]  Dula?
[14045.15s -> 14045.95s]  No.
[14045.95s -> 14069.33s]  Oh, I do love mercy on the poor boss.
[14076.69s -> 14078.13s]  I got stuff growing on them.
[14078.77s -> 14101.66s]  Oh, what?
[14101.66s -> 14102.54s]  Oh, we fell down.
[14104.64s -> 14110.32s]  Oh, very cool.
[14112.34s -> 14112.66s]  Damn.
[14112.66s -> 14114.50s]  That's another hundred and twenty five K.
[14114.50s -> 14115.62s]  You're for a storm.
[14116.42s -> 14119.52s]  What a thematically appropriate.
[14119.52s -> 14120.48s]  I didn't bring the drop.
[14121.20s -> 14126.74s]  We could definitely be millennia.
[14128.91s -> 14133.15s]  Maybe I actually have three times the HP I did when we were trying it.
[14133.15s -> 14137.79s]  I want my swords to be leveled up another once two or three times.
[14137.79s -> 14139.71s]  I want to get them to at least plus 20 before we do that.
[14139.71s -> 14142.43s]  OK, so earlier when I said let's go do some like leveling up
[14142.43s -> 14145.55s]  because we've got a whole bunch of Smith's stones and you said no.
[14147.41s -> 14149.33s]  Was that so that we wouldn't have to fight millennia?
[14149.97s -> 14150.13s]  No.
[14151.50s -> 14152.86s]  Right after that, I was like, no, you know what?
[14152.86s -> 14153.50s]  Let's get out of here.
[14154.14s -> 14157.57s]  You got another ancient.
[14157.57s -> 14159.17s]  I have two ancient dragon spinning stones.
[14162.91s -> 14163.79s]  Do you want me just to give them to you?
[14165.39s -> 14165.63s]  Sure.
[14169.73s -> 14171.01s]  I'll be your stone master.
[14171.01s -> 14171.73s]  Remember to level up.
[14171.73s -> 14173.97s]  We just got a lot of room.
[14173.97s -> 14175.25s]  And make sure you grab those.
[14175.25s -> 14178.13s]  There's two omega items on the ground.
[14178.13s -> 14178.77s]  Yeah, I don't want them.
[14182.91s -> 14183.95s]  Molina is picking them up.
[14187.09s -> 14189.09s]  I'm afraid to sit down because I don't want them to disappear.
[14193.09s -> 14193.57s]  Pick them up.
[14193.57s -> 14193.97s]  Pick them up.
[14193.97s -> 14194.45s]  Pick them up.
[14196.03s -> 14197.47s]  I didn't concern me.
[14197.47s -> 14198.67s]  You can put them back down.
[14199.31s -> 14200.67s]  I thought you crashed.
[14200.67s -> 14203.31s]  And I thought it was going to make you move or something.
[14203.87s -> 14204.75s]  I thought you crashed.
[14205.39s -> 14206.11s]  Okay.
[14206.11s -> 14208.56s]  I got them.
[14208.56s -> 14218.54s]  Oh, there's a there's a what the heck?
[14219.34s -> 14220.38s]  There's a jail right here.
[14221.18s -> 14223.47s]  Let's do it.
[14223.47s -> 14225.95s]  Might as well.
[14231.82s -> 14232.62s]  In it.
[14232.62s -> 14232.94s]  Where is it?
[14232.94s -> 14233.58s]  In it.
[14233.58s -> 14234.78s]  I think up the hill a little bit.
[14235.50s -> 14239.81s]  It's normally the pro tag is in here.
[14243.58s -> 14243.90s]  In it.
[14247.76s -> 14249.44s]  What the hell was that?
[14250.08s -> 14251.04s]  Oh, my God.
[14251.04s -> 14251.68s]  Assassin.
[14252.56s -> 14255.20s]  Well, we just got collateral.
[14256.00s -> 14269.92s]  There's your sniper still here.
[14273.26s -> 14274.30s]  No, he's gone.
[14281.86s -> 14283.86s]  That was that was surprising.
[14284.42s -> 14285.70s]  My cat loves watching you.
[14287.30s -> 14287.86s]  That's cute.
[14288.42s -> 14304.48s]  All right.
[14304.48s -> 14306.00s]  The chain.
[14307.36s -> 14314.10s]  That guy was big and strong and his muscles were bulging out of his freaking skin.
[14315.06s -> 14317.39s]  We're going to go up this way.
[14318.59s -> 14320.19s]  There is a bonfire up here.
[14320.91s -> 14325.73s]  I thought there was a jail here.
[14325.73s -> 14328.45s]  I don't see it.
[14330.75s -> 14331.47s]  Are you looking?
[14332.27s -> 14333.18s]  I looked.
[14333.90s -> 14335.50s]  Do you have eyes?
[14335.50s -> 14336.86s]  I mean, I skimmed it.
[14336.86s -> 14337.66s]  I scanned it.
[14338.46s -> 14356.74s]  Oh, that's right.
[14356.74s -> 14357.62s]  There's this place here.
[14358.18s -> 14368.08s]  Somebody said we technically did the final assassination mission.
[14368.80s -> 14371.20s]  So we should be able to turn that in and just go right to right card.
[14373.84s -> 14375.28s]  If you want to be technical about it.
[14383.55s -> 14384.91s]  I think stone eight.
[14386.66s -> 14389.30s]  OK, I've been waiting for this the whole game is up here.
[14389.30s -> 14391.70s]  I can finally get rivers of blood and play my real build.
[14392.42s -> 14396.21s]  Forgot about right card.
[14396.21s -> 14396.61s]  Yeah.
[14396.61s -> 14397.17s]  We did, too.
[14401.42s -> 14402.54s]  Don't look down.
[14408.02s -> 14408.50s]  All right.
[14408.50s -> 14410.26s]  If it's radan, I owe you 20 bucks.
[14410.26s -> 14412.58s]  If it's also rated three spirit, you owe me 50 bucks.
[14413.81s -> 14414.13s]  OK.
[14414.77s -> 14417.14s]  I'm that confident.
[14417.78s -> 14424.75s]  And if it's general grievous.
[14425.63s -> 14427.15s]  It's general grievous.
[14427.87s -> 14428.19s]  Yeah.
[14428.19s -> 14429.63s]  There'll be ones back there.
[14429.63s -> 14430.51s]  Then we both.
[14434.05s -> 14438.21s]  See, I was trying to say grievous, but general grievous is a POE guy.
[14439.01s -> 14442.88s]  Oh, you covered for me.
[14442.88s -> 14444.16s]  Aaron, here's your cool.
[14444.80s -> 14447.23s]  Let me be clear.
[14450.06s -> 14453.41s]  All right.
[14454.53s -> 14455.25s]  This is not.
[14456.13s -> 14456.78s]  The way.
[14457.50s -> 14458.06s]  No, it's not.
[14458.06s -> 14458.70s]  I was just looking.
[14458.70s -> 14459.66s]  I was just taking a peek.
[14483.14s -> 14484.90s]  Oh, tarnish mine.
[14485.54s -> 14487.78s]  Your peepee is too small.
[14487.78s -> 14489.22s]  And they're laying there.
[14489.94s -> 14492.34s]  You must grow two inches.
[14493.54s -> 14512.50s]  I can see it was bonfire.
[14513.06s -> 14518.77s]  Tony said, dude, the vibes are rotten right now.
[14520.16s -> 14520.72s]  Are they?
[14520.72s -> 14522.08s]  Sorry, I don't think so.
[14522.08s -> 14522.56s]  I don't know.
[14524.69s -> 14525.89s]  I don't think the vibes are rotten.
[14533.76s -> 14535.12s]  It's not this way.
[14535.12s -> 14536.88s]  But this way, there's I see like a tree.
[14546.34s -> 14547.46s]  Oh, actually worth.
[14547.46s -> 14548.82s]  Oh, dude.
[14548.82s -> 14549.46s]  It was a good thing.
[14549.46s -> 14550.42s]  I went to that tree.
[14550.42s -> 14550.66s]  Why?
[14551.46s -> 14555.14s]  I actually got for real carrying greatsword this time.
[14555.14s -> 14556.02s]  Like, for real.
[14556.02s -> 14556.66s]  Not a joke.
[14557.78s -> 14559.70s]  Actual carrying greatsword.
[14559.70s -> 14560.74s]  You're fucking with me.
[14562.00s -> 14562.48s]  What?
[14562.48s -> 14563.28s]  You're fucking with me.
[14564.08s -> 14564.56s]  No, I'm not.
[14566.96s -> 14567.44s]  You got it.
[14568.24s -> 14569.62s]  Yeah, dude.
[14569.62s -> 14570.90s]  No, you're screwing with me right now.
[14570.90s -> 14571.54s]  You're lying.
[14571.54s -> 14573.46s]  There's no way you got carrying greatsword.
[14573.86s -> 14576.98s]  That's something that you would lie about because that's so unbelievable.
[14577.86s -> 14579.58s]  I don't know if I believe you.
[14580.46s -> 14581.81s]  We're doing a bit.
[14582.69s -> 14582.93s]  Yes.
[14583.89s -> 14592.46s]  Oh, Lord, Lord, this guy's got two fingers.
[14594.00s -> 14595.76s]  This hand has got two fingers, dude.
[14601.82s -> 14607.10s]  He does with the Giants, like cutting their fingers off or something.
[14607.90s -> 14610.78s]  And he's got he's got he's got tree stuff growing out of his arm.
[14610.78s -> 14611.58s]  He's a tree.
[14611.58s -> 14612.38s]  Giants are trees.
[14612.94s -> 14615.82s]  Their hands are their brains and stirs right all along.
[14615.82s -> 14618.14s]  But why would they why would they be cutting their fingers off?
[14618.14s -> 14618.54s]  I wonder.
[14625.04s -> 14625.52s]  They aren't.
[14625.52s -> 14626.80s]  They are missing a lot of arms.
[14626.80s -> 14629.12s]  They're missing the three fingers, aren't they?
[14629.68s -> 14631.76s]  Like the bad ones, right?
[14631.76s -> 14633.20s]  Yeah, they're missing the bad boys.
[14634.70s -> 14637.28s]  Huh, that actually is interesting.
[14642.24s -> 14644.16s]  Maybe they're trying to commune with the greater will.
[14644.96s -> 14646.88s]  Yeah, maybe that's interesting.
[14647.68s -> 14651.12s]  You just unlock some new vibes from me here.
[14652.00s -> 14653.44s]  Wow, I saved the vibe.
[14654.24s -> 14654.88s]  All right, you ready?
[14655.44s -> 14657.06s]  Let's do it.
[14657.78s -> 14659.22s]  Yes, am I?
[14660.26s -> 14661.38s]  And by the chain.
[14661.38s -> 14662.02s]  But let's do it.
[14662.02s -> 14664.02s]  We need to go a completely different direction.
[14664.58s -> 14665.54s]  But there's an item over here.
[14666.10s -> 14667.20s]  No, it's not.
[14668.32s -> 14669.04s]  Stinky item.
[14669.04s -> 14669.60s]  No, it's right here.
[14670.24s -> 14673.57s]  Vibes have been restored.
[14673.57s -> 14674.13s]  Yeah, a little.
[14677.09s -> 14677.81s]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[14677.81s -> 14679.17s]  It's a little spot right here.
[14679.17s -> 14679.97s]  OK, here we go.
[14680.85s -> 14682.05s]  What is the boss?
[14682.85s -> 14683.81s]  It's through here.
[14685.07s -> 14686.21s]  What is it?
[14686.21s -> 14687.17s]  We're done.
[14687.17s -> 14692.30s]  Do we let let them bet?
[14692.30s -> 14693.18s]  Will we go in?
[14693.90s -> 14694.86s]  I'll let them bet.
[14696.54s -> 14697.26s]  Vote or die.
[14704.03s -> 14705.31s]  It's going to be a boat guy.
[14705.31s -> 14705.95s]  That would be funny.
[14708.21s -> 14709.81s]  We haven't seen a lot of boat guys.
[14710.78s -> 14715.06s]  No, our bosses cannot spawn again.
[14715.70s -> 14719.54s]  So Melania is in that manor spot permanently.
[14719.54s -> 14720.82s]  Same thing with Eldenbeast.
[14727.58s -> 14728.62s]  Alaketh, that's right.
[14728.62s -> 14729.26s]  That could be bad.
[14730.22s -> 14731.34s]  Got a big skull down here.
[14736.02s -> 14737.22s]  Guy's looking kind of dead.
[14742.21s -> 14742.85s]  All in.
[14743.74s -> 14744.46s]  Don't.
[14744.46s -> 14745.90s]  Oh, OK, some people are going all in.
[14747.09s -> 14749.41s]  This is 20 million channel points.
[14749.41s -> 14750.69s]  They're saying we're going to do it.
[14750.69s -> 14751.33s]  I'll hold up.
[14751.33s -> 14752.05s]  I'm predicting.
[14752.69s -> 14753.49s]  Are you voting?
[14754.37s -> 14757.70s]  Yeah, you got like two seconds.
[14759.78s -> 14760.34s]  I missed it.
[14761.22s -> 14763.60s]  OK, here we go.
[14763.60s -> 14764.00s]  What is it?
[14770.05s -> 14771.09s]  It's Horoloo.
[14772.29s -> 14773.17s]  The fire version.
[14775.94s -> 14777.54s]  It's phase two Horoloo.
[14778.82s -> 14779.94s]  It's the grab hat.
[14779.94s -> 14780.82s]  He's going to grab you.
[14785.39s -> 14786.75s]  Just run away from him for a second.
[14787.31s -> 14800.08s]  He's trying to grab me.
[14800.08s -> 14800.88s]  Oh, shit.
[14801.60s -> 14807.31s]  Oh, shit.
[14807.31s -> 14807.79s]  He got me.
[14808.51s -> 14809.39s]  He just powerbombed me.
[14810.11s -> 14811.95s]  Take aggro.
[14814.94s -> 14817.66s]  This is actually a pretty funny fight to be on a horse.
[14817.66s -> 14820.46s]  I don't even know if he can grab you off your horse.
[14820.46s -> 14821.10s]  I think he can.
[14822.14s -> 14823.34s]  Let's horse this guy down.
[14830.29s -> 14830.79s]  Uh-oh.
[14831.57s -> 14832.07s]  Star.
[14832.93s -> 14833.43s]  Star.
[14834.29s -> 14836.82s]  He's going to get you.
[14840.98s -> 14843.06s]  This is actually fucking scary.
[14843.06s -> 14844.58s]  I feel like I'm playing a horror game.
[14845.30s -> 14853.71s]  Why did you just go in?
[14853.71s -> 14854.67s]  Why did you do that?
[14854.67s -> 14857.39s]  Because it was under the snow and I thought there was a snow buffer.
[14864.82s -> 14865.22s]  Oh, no.
[14865.22s -> 14868.02s]  So when people are like, my points, they're going to do it.
[14868.74s -> 14872.58s]  I think we are.
[14873.14s -> 14874.80s]  I can't lock onto him anymore.
[14874.80s -> 14877.28s]  So that's not helping.
[14880.69s -> 14883.49s]  This white asshole is riding around these horses.
[14883.49s -> 14884.45s]  This is so unfair.
[14894.77s -> 14895.57s]  He couldn't grab me.
[14898.14s -> 14901.01s]  He should have, but he could not.
[14902.21s -> 14903.09s]  What the fuck?
[14912.53s -> 14914.05s]  I can't lock onto him, dude.
[14914.77s -> 14915.41s]  Neither can I.
[14916.21s -> 14935.20s]  Oh, shit.
[14935.20s -> 14935.76s]  He's doing it.
[14938.94s -> 14940.69s]  I'm under the ground.
[14947.65s -> 14948.29s]  Oh, he's got me.
[14955.33s -> 14957.89s]  He's he's beard.
[14957.89s -> 14958.77s]  He's teleported.
[14961.10s -> 14961.98s]  He is having trouble.
[14961.98s -> 14962.94s]  He's like a hologram.
[14979.12s -> 14981.76s]  Oh, we're going to get really cocky here, I think.
[14981.76s -> 14982.72s]  And it's going to be a downfall.
[14983.68s -> 14984.48s]  Holy shit.
[14987.46s -> 14987.78s]  Wow.
[14987.78s -> 14989.46s]  I didn't think I would hit me that high up.
[14989.46s -> 14991.06s]  Who would program that hitbox?
[14991.78s -> 14994.26s]  Fuck hockey.
[14994.26s -> 14995.78s]  I just can't lock onto this shit.
[14997.60s -> 14998.24s]  Oh, fuck.
[14998.88s -> 15003.52s]  All right.
[15003.52s -> 15004.24s]  Just hit him one time.
[15004.24s -> 15005.12s]  One time.
[15005.12s -> 15006.24s]  Hit him one time.
[15006.62s -> 15007.18s]  Well, can you?
[15010.10s -> 15010.98s]  Sorry, doubters.
[15011.62s -> 15012.98s]  It's too bad I didn't get my vote in.
[15015.18s -> 15016.22s]  Wait a minute.
[15016.22s -> 15017.02s]  There's a no.
[15017.02s -> 15017.58s]  Wait a minute.
[15017.58s -> 15019.02s]  Wait, don't pay it out yet.
[15019.02s -> 15020.22s]  Don't pay it out yet.
[15020.22s -> 15021.18s]  They paid it out.
[15021.98s -> 15023.76s]  They scammed everyone.
[15023.76s -> 15024.48s]  This is dude.
[15024.48s -> 15025.52s]  Is this a mega scam?
[15026.16s -> 15026.56s]  Uh oh.
[15027.28s -> 15035.46s]  I skipped.
[15037.47s -> 15039.71s]  Look, I transformed into a wolf.
[15040.35s -> 15042.91s]  That's that would be so lame.
[15045.95s -> 15047.26s]  All right.
[15047.26s -> 15048.54s]  Look at how scary I am.
[15048.54s -> 15052.99s]  Sorry.
[15052.99s -> 15054.43s]  I've always acted this wolf.
[15054.43s -> 15054.83s]  Oh my god.
[15054.83s -> 15055.87s]  That feels a lot of damage.
[15056.51s -> 15059.06s]  I have no more healing.
[15059.62s -> 15063.02s]  Hey, we got really cocky.
[15066.75s -> 15067.47s]  Oh shit.
[15067.47s -> 15069.07s]  This is actually kind of bad.
[15072.37s -> 15074.05s]  You have to win or you scammed everyone.
[15075.89s -> 15076.93s]  You have to win.
[15077.97s -> 15086.85s]  I've got some warming stones down.
[15095.06s -> 15097.78s]  At least I can't throw more than that far.
[15117.97s -> 15120.05s]  Why are you doing like Homer Simpson yells?
[15122.99s -> 15123.31s]  Sorry.
[15124.27s -> 15133.71s]  Oh shit.
[15141.02s -> 15141.58s]  Don't do it.
[15143.42s -> 15147.50s]  Sir, it's going to be up to you.
[15147.50s -> 15149.10s]  I'm going to be able to hit him one or two more times.
[15149.10s -> 15167.33s]  You're going to have to for the guild or something for the guild.
[15169.33s -> 15171.73s]  Scam did not happen.
[15171.73s -> 15172.45s]  Scam averted.
[15173.65s -> 15176.93s]  Sword key for the teleporter.
[15176.93s -> 15177.73s]  Oh, nice.
[15177.73s -> 15179.68s]  And some battle bearings.
[15179.68s -> 15180.00s]  All right.
[15180.72s -> 15181.98s]  Let's go smoke a bowl.
[15183.74s -> 15184.14s]  Let's go.
[15184.14s -> 15184.62s]  I can't.
[15184.62s -> 15185.74s]  I can't get on my horse.
[15187.02s -> 15187.42s]  I can't either.
[15197.73s -> 15200.77s]  That could have gone really, really wrong if that was not that dog.
[15201.50s -> 15203.26s]  I think you get you get like canceled.
[15205.02s -> 15206.54s]  I think if we didn't kill that.
[15207.42s -> 15209.74s]  Like scamming everybody out of channel.
[15211.34s -> 15212.62s]  I don't think you recover from that.
[15227.90s -> 15229.38s]  All right.
[15229.38s -> 15230.82s]  So we're going to burn the tree.
[15231.54s -> 15234.58s]  I'm going to go take a pee break because I didn't go when you did.
[15234.58s -> 15237.89s]  I'm going to get I'm going to refill my little drink here.
[15237.89s -> 15239.73s]  And I'm going to do like a grab a snack.
[15240.21s -> 15241.01s]  Okay.
[15241.01s -> 15241.81s]  As well.
[15241.81s -> 15249.70s]  And then we can assess what we want to do because we've got our Missoula.
[15252.59s -> 15254.59s]  Did you walk into the bowl when you played?
[15254.59s -> 15256.03s]  You just you just walk into the center.
[15256.59s -> 15257.15s]  I don't remember.
[15257.15s -> 15257.95s]  No, I don't think so.
[15258.75s -> 15264.50s]  I did because it doesn't even look that far down.
[15265.58s -> 15267.66s]  And there's like a thing in the middle.
[15267.66s -> 15268.62s]  I fell.
[15268.62s -> 15269.58s]  I just walked straight in.
[15271.18s -> 15271.82s]  Maybe I did.
[15273.54s -> 15273.94s]  You did.
[15273.94s -> 15277.06s]  I think I remember you saying to me that you also did it back.
[15277.06s -> 15277.70s]  I probably did.
[15278.34s -> 15279.15s]  All right.
[15279.55s -> 15282.67s]  You should probably just do this because I'm imagining your host.
[15282.67s -> 15283.31s]  You should just do it.
[15283.95s -> 15284.91s]  Yeah.
[15284.91s -> 15286.99s]  I mean, like I am the chosen one.
[15286.99s -> 15289.79s]  So I don't mean to like be that guy.
[15289.79s -> 15290.99s]  But what do I do?
[15293.31s -> 15295.07s]  You say, yes, I'd like to burn the tree.
[15296.98s -> 15299.86s]  She won't talk to me.
[15299.86s -> 15302.98s]  I think as you sat down first, you like took her.
[15302.98s -> 15304.77s]  You won't talk to me either.
[15304.77s -> 15307.94s]  I think there is an item we need.
[15307.94s -> 15312.24s]  I was saying earlier, I think there's like a burn the bush kind of like joint.
[15312.24s -> 15314.98s]  We have to do something.
[15314.98s -> 15316.02s]  I think we have to do it solo.
[15319.20s -> 15319.44s]  Okay.
[15319.44s -> 15319.76s]  Yeah.
[15319.76s -> 15320.40s]  Just kick me out.
[15321.14s -> 15321.86s]  Kick me out.
[15321.86s -> 15325.68s]  Go do some actually wait before you kick me out.
[15325.68s -> 15326.88s]  I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[15328.08s -> 15332.50s]  And I would appreciate it in this time when we're going to bathroom, coming back.
[15332.50s -> 15339.63s]  I appreciate if you take all these stones, please shove them up my ass like a baseball.
[15340.67s -> 15341.95s]  I would say you probably shouldn't do that.
[15341.95s -> 15345.33s]  But I don't know how many you need.
[15345.33s -> 15346.05s]  You would need.
[15346.05s -> 15348.29s]  So how many plus sevens do you need?
[15348.29s -> 15349.09s]  Three.
[15349.09s -> 15352.21s]  Just give them all to me, man.
[15352.21s -> 15353.01s]  I don't know.
[15353.01s -> 15354.77s]  And then I have a couple of plus eights.
[15354.77s -> 15358.10s]  Here you go.
[15358.10s -> 15365.84s]  So then I would appreciate it if you were to take these and go upgrade the absolute
[15365.84s -> 15366.64s]  hell out of them.
[15366.64s -> 15370.14s]  I would really appreciate it.
[15370.14s -> 15374.61s]  That's a lot.
[15374.61s -> 15375.65s]  That's a lot of stones.
[15377.49s -> 15379.97s]  Dude, if you guys thought we were pumping that damage,
[15379.97s -> 15382.29s]  wait until you see us when we come back from the short break.
[15383.57s -> 15385.09s]  See you when we come back from the break.
[15385.09s -> 15391.06s]  See you in a minute.
[15396.40s -> 15666.86s]  Hello.
[15666.86s -> 15676.93s]  Hey, I got some super crunchy pretzels.
[15676.93s -> 15678.51s]  I made some naan bread.
[15678.51s -> 15682.30s]  And apparently I like let the cut scene play for burning it.
[15683.18s -> 15688.54s]  And I put music on and my chat saying it was like an AMV and everything fits so perfectly.
[15688.54s -> 15691.18s]  Like scene changes had song changes.
[15698.35s -> 15699.39s]  They're like so baffled.
[15699.39s -> 15700.75s]  They want me to go back and watch it.
[15702.14s -> 15703.26s]  I might be in some trouble here.
[15704.94s -> 15705.90s]  No, no, no, I'm all right.
[15707.34s -> 15708.46s]  I thought I had mine.
[15708.46s -> 15709.74s]  Oh, the IRS doesn't know yet.
[15715.10s -> 15716.94s]  You're crunching right in your mic, man.
[15716.94s -> 15717.74s]  No, I am.
[15718.30s -> 15719.66s]  I'm like pretty far back.
[15720.22s -> 15722.45s]  It's pretty loud.
[15722.45s -> 15723.25s]  Is it loud?
[15723.25s -> 15726.37s]  I'm like, dude, can you hear how far away I am?
[15728.54s -> 15732.06s]  You sound a little echoey, but it is like you're crunching right in the mic.
[15732.06s -> 15732.30s]  What?
[15736.06s -> 15737.90s]  I am like across the room.
[15737.90s -> 15752.02s]  I have long observed the lands between.
[15752.74s -> 15754.82s]  This world is in undead.
[15756.26s -> 15757.78s]  You're a bad boy.
[15757.78s -> 15759.78s]  You've been a bad, bad boy.
[15760.82s -> 15764.74s]  I'm just sitting back watching Elden Ring and just like crunching on something.
[15765.38s -> 15771.76s]  Oh, I was supposed to go upgrade your weapons.
[15772.32s -> 15773.68s]  Yeah, you're supposed to do that.
[15775.92s -> 15782.42s]  Well, I'm in Faramundana and I got to get a bonfire.
[15782.42s -> 15782.90s]  I was.
[15783.63s -> 15784.53s]  Hold on.
[15784.53s -> 15786.29s]  I would I would say you should go do it, too.
[15786.29s -> 15788.67s]  But like I have your weapons.
[15788.67s -> 15791.39s]  Yeah, go do that and then go go to Armazilla.
[15814.91s -> 15815.15s]  What?
[15815.15s -> 15815.71s]  Stop doing it.
[15815.71s -> 15816.27s]  I got hit.
[15816.27s -> 15817.95s]  That was that was a hit noise.
[15817.95s -> 15819.79s]  That was me reacting to getting hit.
[15821.28s -> 15821.92s]  Wait, what happened?
[15822.72s -> 15823.28s]  Huh?
[15823.28s -> 15826.32s]  Oh, I was I'm just I'm just eating.
[15826.96s -> 15830.24s]  I I there is an earthquake in my head right now when I chew.
[15830.24s -> 15831.44s]  I can't hear anything you're saying.
[15844.29s -> 15845.17s]  Is it really that bad?
[15859.01s -> 15862.85s]  It sounds like you're eating like a human hand with how many bones are crunching.
[15864.96s -> 15867.63s]  Like, dude, this is awful.
[15867.63s -> 15868.35s]  Oh, my God.
[15882.88s -> 15884.48s]  Drywall tastes a little different today.
[15895.52s -> 15897.28s]  It might be about it might be about that time.
[15898.50s -> 15902.86s]  It might be about that time.
[15903.58s -> 15904.64s]  Sample it.
[15904.64s -> 15928.32s]  Let me change your channel to like mukbang.
[15929.12s -> 15966.34s]  Ready or awfully quiet.
[15966.34s -> 15967.22s]  I don't.
[15967.22s -> 15968.10s]  Delicious.
[15973.46s -> 15973.78s]  What?
[15975.28s -> 15976.00s]  What?
[15976.00s -> 15980.02s]  I don't know, man.
[15980.02s -> 15981.54s]  I don't know what you're doing.
[15981.54s -> 15982.50s]  I don't know what you're on about.
[15985.12s -> 15988.03s]  OK, I want another one.
[15988.03s -> 15988.51s]  So bad.
[15988.51s -> 15988.75s]  All right.
[15990.38s -> 15991.82s]  I am at Armazilla.
[15991.82s -> 15993.82s]  I'm imagining we should get the first bonfire.
[15993.90s -> 15997.66s]  Get the first bonfire and I got both of your swords to plus 25, dude.
[16001.63s -> 16002.51s]  You know what that means?
[16002.51s -> 16003.47s]  I didn't even want that item.
[16006.82s -> 16010.29s]  That means we have to go fight Melania.
[16010.29s -> 16010.93s]  Say it.
[16010.93s -> 16012.37s]  I know that's what you want to say.
[16012.37s -> 16014.93s]  That means we have to go fight Melania.
[16014.93s -> 16016.21s]  Where even is the first bonfire?
[16018.05s -> 16020.45s]  You got to go past the first group of enemies and it's on the left.
[16038.14s -> 16039.90s]  What the fuck was that?
[16040.54s -> 16041.18s]  Why did I go?
[16043.89s -> 16045.09s]  I'm holding forward.
[16045.09s -> 16047.17s]  Why did I go back dodge?
[16047.17s -> 16047.49s]  What?
[16051.44s -> 16053.76s]  I'm holding forward and going like this.
[16053.76s -> 16054.96s]  Why did he go like this?
[16055.52s -> 16061.74s]  That's very cringe streamer.
[16062.54s -> 16062.94s]  It was.
[16062.94s -> 16063.66s]  That was annoying.
[16065.57s -> 16069.76s]  OK, I'm ready.
[16069.76s -> 16072.00s]  So you want let's go fight Melania.
[16072.00s -> 16076.72s]  Go beat Melania first try because we have an insane amount of abilities now.
[16077.28s -> 16079.68s]  We have a ton of health.
[16080.32s -> 16081.39s]  Should be able to.
[16082.19s -> 16084.19s]  Any damage we can probably mitigate it pretty well.
[16085.55s -> 16086.75s]  I feel you.
[16087.55s -> 16091.17s]  Would you date phase one Melania or phase two?
[16093.70s -> 16094.98s]  I hate this character.
[16095.94s -> 16096.34s]  Sorry.
[16097.46s -> 16111.66s]  OK, we're actually going to go fighter.
[16111.66s -> 16114.62s]  OK, I'm ready to join your game.
[16115.34s -> 16125.66s]  I forget what waypoint it is now because we can do the other the easier shortcut.
[16127.02s -> 16130.50s]  You overclock your gaming system.
[16130.50s -> 16131.22s]  I did not.
[16131.94s -> 16133.38s]  My room is hot enough already.
[16134.02s -> 16136.27s]  I'm opening my world to wanderers.
[16136.91s -> 16137.71s]  Thank you.
[16137.71s -> 16149.34s]  Going to get the rot.
[16150.06s -> 16154.91s]  If you date Melania, you get the rot.
[16156.67s -> 16158.05s]  All right, give me my weapons.
[16158.05s -> 16164.13s]  I threw them in the fucking volcano.
[16165.54s -> 16166.18s]  You're out.
[16166.18s -> 16166.66s]  You're out.
[16166.66s -> 16167.86s]  And I win.
[16167.86s -> 16168.82s]  They would.
[16168.82s -> 16169.86s]  The ref would call the match.
[16170.58s -> 16171.54s]  The ref would call the match.
[16172.10s -> 16178.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[16178.94s -> 16180.42s]  Oh, yeah.
[16180.42s -> 16182.93s]  Let's see.
[16183.33s -> 16183.89s]  Oh, yeah.
[16184.85s -> 16190.85s]  Re 21 301.
[16190.85s -> 16194.37s]  Make sure you put some preserving blouses on your hot bar.
[16197.15s -> 16197.87s]  You're going to need them.
[16198.91s -> 16203.87s]  Look at these.
[16205.82s -> 16206.06s]  All right.
[16206.06s -> 16206.86s]  Let me do this real quick.
[16208.40s -> 16212.93s]  Oh, I'm just going to dump strength.
[16212.93s -> 16215.90s]  Need a little bit more.
[16222.02s -> 16223.82s]  Oh, you get away from me.
[16223.82s -> 16224.62s]  What are you doing that for?
[16225.50s -> 16225.74s]  Okay.
[16228.03s -> 16229.55s]  He's becoming stronger.
[16230.51s -> 16234.19s]  I now am so unbelievably strong.
[16234.19s -> 16234.67s]  Are you ready?
[16235.23s -> 16235.79s]  Yeah.
[16235.79s -> 16237.95s]  Let's go beat Melania.
[16249.20s -> 16251.28s]  If we lose, it's because you killed that musician.
[16251.92s -> 16259.47s]  To be clear.
[16259.47s -> 16260.19s]  Let us bet.
[16260.19s -> 16260.67s]  Let them bet.
[16262.43s -> 16262.99s]  And how many?
[16265.76s -> 16266.48s]  I don't know.
[16266.48s -> 16267.20s]  Five.
[16267.20s -> 16268.34s]  Five attempts or ten?
[16270.45s -> 16271.17s]  In three.
[16271.17s -> 16272.29s]  I think we got it in three.
[16272.29s -> 16273.81s]  Oh, I don't know if I bet on that.
[16275.02s -> 16277.74s]  Well, you're going to get killed by the water foul thing.
[16278.46s -> 16280.14s]  You're going to get killed by the water dance thing.
[16280.94s -> 16281.90s]  No, shut up.
[16281.90s -> 16282.62s]  And then you're going to go.
[16282.62s -> 16283.74s]  No, no, no.
[16283.74s -> 16284.78s]  We're going to have to restart.
[16284.78s -> 16285.10s]  Okay.
[16285.10s -> 16286.46s]  That's going to be you in a second.
[16286.46s -> 16287.34s]  You're going to get killed.
[16287.34s -> 16287.74s]  No, it's not.
[16287.74s -> 16289.02s]  You're the you're bad.
[16289.02s -> 16289.82s]  You're bad.
[16289.82s -> 16291.02s]  I forgot to upgrade my moon veil.
[16291.02s -> 16291.34s]  Fuck.
[16292.06s -> 16294.56s]  See, it's already an issue.
[16294.56s -> 16299.39s]  Well, I was upgrading your things and I got distracted.
[16299.39s -> 16304.34s]  I'm probably not even going to use it.
[16304.34s -> 16304.58s]  Okay.
[16304.58s -> 16306.10s]  Let's go upgrade moon veil.
[16307.06s -> 16316.37s]  I it's going to do the thing again where it's not going to lose.
[16318.37s -> 16321.41s]  They're so overleveled, but everything scales.
[16322.22s -> 16328.10s]  If we lose to her, then we have to do a full playthrough in Genshin Impact.
[16329.60s -> 16331.28s]  No, no, dude.
[16331.28s -> 16331.84s]  I'm not.
[16331.84s -> 16333.04s]  I don't want to agree to that.
[16334.64s -> 16337.12s]  That's just like I have nothing against that game.
[16337.12s -> 16337.68s]  I just don't.
[16337.68s -> 16338.48s]  We lose to her.
[16338.48s -> 16341.04s]  Then we have to get to like Masters and League of Legends.
[16341.04s -> 16344.00s]  What is what is that's going to take years?
[16344.00s -> 16345.04s]  That's going to take months.
[16345.60s -> 16354.45s]  I'm sorry.
[16354.45s -> 16355.81s]  I just love this joke.
[16355.81s -> 16357.01s]  I don't want to play either of them.
[16357.01s -> 16358.21s]  I don't I don't either.
[16358.21s -> 16359.57s]  Like I've not again.
[16359.57s -> 16362.21s]  Should impact is probably pretty fun.
[16362.21s -> 16362.85s]  I don't know.
[16362.85s -> 16369.73s]  I don't want to play it for like the next six months.
[16369.73s -> 16373.17s]  We both have to eat an Arby's euro if we lose.
[16376.37s -> 16377.33s]  My moon does plus 10.
[16377.33s -> 16377.81s]  Let's go back.
[16378.37s -> 16380.05s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[16384.32s -> 16385.68s]  Wait, that's weird.
[16385.68s -> 16387.28s]  I don't I don't know who upgraded that.
[16387.28s -> 16389.84s]  I didn't because I wouldn't want to like upgrade a moon veil.
[16389.84s -> 16398.03s]  What it's doing that thing again.
[16400.53s -> 16402.21s]  If we don't we don't do it in 10 tries.
[16402.21s -> 16404.93s]  We have to both eat an Arby's euro.
[16404.93s -> 16407.17s]  I honestly think we'll get it in like three.
[16407.17s -> 16411.33s]  You're underestimating how incredibly.
[16411.33s -> 16414.37s]  I'm just trying to get like believers to give the doubters money.
[16414.37s -> 16418.38s]  Yeah, I don't know if it already passed.
[16418.38s -> 16429.79s]  Okay, German beat this game.
[16429.79s -> 16430.91s]  I beat this game.
[16430.91s -> 16432.19s]  I'm an accomplished gamer.
[16432.19s -> 16434.67s]  I shit my pants to win a quick play game in Overwatch.
[16434.67s -> 16437.95s]  Like I'm a born again gamer.
[16437.95s -> 16439.87s]  Be careful how many times you say that though,
[16439.87s -> 16441.39s]  because I feel like that's like your legacy.
[16441.39s -> 16444.91s]  If you continue to say that it is that's that.
[16444.91s -> 16450.19s]  That turns into legacy if that's continued to be kind of spoken of.
[16450.19s -> 16450.75s]  I don't know.
[16450.75s -> 16451.23s]  It's fine.
[16451.23s -> 16454.27s]  It's it's in my I think it's in my channel information.
[16455.89s -> 16456.53s]  Is it really?
[16457.09s -> 16457.65s]  It might be.
[16457.65s -> 16458.37s]  I'd have to double check.
[16458.37s -> 16460.21s]  That's actually really funny.
[16461.78s -> 16465.14s]  I'm actually kind of envious that you shit your pants and put it in your bio
[16465.14s -> 16468.58s]  because that's I feel like that's actually really funny.
[16468.58s -> 16470.51s]  It's the kind of guy I am.
[16470.51s -> 16471.15s]  I'll do it.
[16471.15s -> 16472.67s]  All right, let's let's go.
[16476.11s -> 16518.06s]  Let's do it when when when I'm stuck.
[16519.60s -> 16519.84s]  It's fine.
[16519.84s -> 16520.64s]  She's on me.
[16520.64s -> 16522.96s]  And yeah, I just have I have too much health.
[16522.96s -> 16523.76s]  She can't touch me.
[16524.48s -> 16531.49s]  I'm untouchable.
[16540.98s -> 16570.10s]  Oh, run.
[16570.10s -> 16573.78s]  It's coming to you.
[16573.78s -> 16640.53s]  It's coming to you.
[16640.53s -> 16642.03s]  Dodged.
[16642.03s -> 16643.63s]  You are nothing to me, Blania.
[16648.82s -> 16652.50s]  Oh, get pillared.
[16653.22s -> 16653.78s]  Dumb shit.
[16665.86s -> 16666.90s]  Oh, she's busted.
[16666.90s -> 16667.86s]  She's busted.
[16667.86s -> 16669.14s]  What the fuck just happened in my game?
[16669.70s -> 16671.54s]  I don't I was waiting for you to hit her.
[16678.13s -> 16680.59s]  I told I told you, dude.
[16682.29s -> 16683.81s]  I got fucking told you.
[16684.05s -> 16686.21s]  I got Morgoth's great run.
[16686.21s -> 16686.71s]  Same.
[16692.29s -> 16693.49s]  You didn't believe in three.
[16693.49s -> 16696.29s]  We were just so fucking weak is the same thing as Placidusix.
[16696.77s -> 16700.05s]  I should not have been fighting her yet.
[16701.41s -> 16702.53s]  Yeah, I mean.
[16707.71s -> 16708.96s]  Fuck.
[16711.94s -> 16712.34s]  Nice.
[16712.34s -> 16714.98s]  You earned a moment from German 985.
[16714.98s -> 16715.70s]  Time to claim.
[16716.70s -> 16717.10s]  Yeah, dude.
[16717.10s -> 16725.10s]  I'm sorry, like being so fucked up, but you want to, you know, roaming up one time.
[16725.10s -> 16725.60s]  What?
[16727.81s -> 16728.77s]  I'm celibate, dude.
[16729.33s -> 16730.37s]  Let me just say something real quick.
[16731.76s -> 16735.36s]  Yeah, if you want to do that, I guess that sounds like fun.
[16735.36s -> 16741.39s]  But just maybe don't talk so much shit next time.
[16741.39s -> 16742.03s]  Who are you?
[16742.03s -> 16743.07s]  Who are you talking to?
[16756.54s -> 16758.78s]  Melania was fucking calling me.
[16758.78s -> 16767.74s]  What?
[16767.74s -> 16771.74s]  My chat asks and I ask, is Jerma's brand weed now?
[16773.38s -> 16779.06s]  Only for this one jokey dumb thing where like we're rolling blunts with Placidusix and shit.
[16779.06s -> 16781.06s]  Like, like just for like the last couple of days.
[16782.10s -> 16784.03s]  I don't know.
[16784.03s -> 16784.67s]  You've changed.
[16791.70s -> 16792.58s]  Wait, did you miss the point?
[16792.58s -> 16796.02s]  Did you miss the fact that that was Melania calling me being like, hey, let's like,
[16796.02s -> 16801.14s]  let's like fucking squash the beef and like, I missed a lot of something
[16801.14s -> 16803.62s]  because it looked like you were like praying at the altar.
[16803.62s -> 16806.10s]  Like you walked up to the altar and you just started talking to yourself.
[16806.10s -> 16807.46s]  Like you could hear God's voice.
[16810.50s -> 16811.62s]  You guys don't get it.
[16819.09s -> 16821.09s]  Jerma has reefer madness.
[16821.81s -> 16824.66s]  We're worried about you.
[16824.66s -> 16826.02s]  Are we are we ready?
[16826.02s -> 16826.34s]  Yes.
[16826.34s -> 16829.02s]  Go kill right card.
[16829.02s -> 16830.38s]  I think it's going to be a radon.
[16830.70s -> 16832.94s]  You think it's going to be a putrid slob.
[16833.82s -> 16835.98s]  I think we have not seen a putrid slob in a while.
[16844.50s -> 16845.70s]  Putrid slob.
[16846.58s -> 16849.42s]  Did you end up making a character in the myriad?
[16849.42s -> 16849.90s]  Yeah.
[16849.90s -> 16851.10s]  I mean like the revolting.
[16851.10s -> 16851.42s]  What was it?
[16851.42s -> 16853.74s]  Like the putrid disgusting slob or something.
[16855.17s -> 16856.13s]  Oh my God.
[16856.13s -> 16856.61s]  I didn't.
[16856.61s -> 16858.85s]  The great putrid slob, I think is all it is.
[16862.22s -> 16864.14s]  He was charging that up.
[16864.14s -> 16866.14s]  He so badly wanted to do that move to us.
[16870.02s -> 16871.54s]  He's just like, I'm.
[16874.03s -> 16874.91s]  Bro, come on.
[16879.57s -> 16880.85s]  I'm inside of the bear.
[16885.41s -> 16886.05s]  Millennia.
[16886.05s -> 16886.69s]  I sleep.
[16886.69s -> 16887.41s]  Giant bear.
[16888.29s -> 16889.49s]  I awaken for the meme.
[16890.13s -> 16893.47s]  This guy shooting crossbows.
[16894.37s -> 16895.09s]  There's a dog.
[16895.89s -> 16898.85s]  Do you remember when these dogs would like multi hit you like 16 times
[16898.85s -> 16899.81s]  and you'd instantly die?
[16901.44s -> 16901.84s]  You're dead.
[16902.66s -> 16904.18s]  I got knocked off by the bear.
[16905.46s -> 16907.30s]  I'm relating to that content right now.
[16913.06s -> 16914.42s]  I'm not going to even reset it.
[16914.42s -> 16915.94s]  I'm just going to come over to where you are.
[16917.25s -> 16918.29s]  I have one of those things.
[16936.83s -> 16937.47s]  Did you kill a bear?
[16938.56s -> 16939.28s]  Now?
[16939.28s -> 16940.08s]  No, help.
[16941.36s -> 16942.00s]  I died.
[16942.00s -> 16942.64s]  It's scary.
[16942.64s -> 16943.76s]  It's scary.
[16953.39s -> 16954.83s]  He's just roaring at you.
[16961.18s -> 16962.14s]  Nice kill.
[16962.14s -> 16963.10s]  You're welcome.
[16963.10s -> 16967.26s]  Yeah, we're going to put that head up above my fireplace.
[16969.38s -> 16970.02s]  Ooh.
[16970.02s -> 16971.74s]  Okay.
[16971.74s -> 16972.70s]  Let everyone know.
[16974.06s -> 16991.17s]  Rycon.
[16991.17s -> 16993.89s]  I hope whoever it is, they still get the voice lines.
[16993.89s -> 16997.01s]  Like how Margaret was saying shit earlier.
[16997.01s -> 16998.53s]  I would have imagined that's the case.
[16999.49s -> 17006.90s]  Wait, did you ask me what's like your top favorite thing
[17006.90s -> 17008.10s]  you would ever want to do or something?
[17009.46s -> 17012.02s]  What was at some point where you were like,
[17012.02s -> 17014.10s]  hey, what's like the number one thing you want to do?
[17014.82s -> 17015.78s]  Want to do.
[17015.78s -> 17016.90s]  Like just like in general.
[17017.62s -> 17020.02s]  I've never asked that, but sure you can continue.
[17020.02s -> 17020.34s]  Okay.
[17021.36s -> 17024.48s]  You know those lava places where you get like,
[17024.48s -> 17027.76s]  you can take like the poker and like poke the gooey lava
[17027.76s -> 17030.08s]  and it kind of just get places in the world.
[17031.73s -> 17033.41s]  I want to go there.
[17034.05s -> 17034.61s]  Eventually.
[17035.25s -> 17038.19s]  You want to poke if you could do anything,
[17038.19s -> 17039.55s]  you want to poke lava.
[17039.55s -> 17041.63s]  I think like going to one of those lava sites,
[17041.63s -> 17042.19s]  whatever they are.
[17042.91s -> 17044.29s]  And they're called volcanoes.
[17044.85s -> 17047.41s]  Yeah, but like there's a safe specific place
[17047.41s -> 17050.37s]  where there's some kind of running down like kind of like this
[17050.37s -> 17052.93s]  and you can kind of just go look at it and like poke it and stuff.
[17055.30s -> 17055.62s]  Okay.
[17056.83s -> 17059.39s]  Don't act like don't act like half of you
[17059.39s -> 17061.31s]  didn't have not watched the YouTube videos
[17061.31s -> 17062.27s]  where people doing that.
[17062.27s -> 17063.23s]  It's like, whoa, cool.
[17063.23s -> 17065.15s]  It's like scientific and don't bat-chest it.
[17065.15s -> 17066.27s]  I will fucking end my stream.
[17072.00s -> 17072.72s]  Don't hurt this guy.
[17076.99s -> 17079.39s]  He just grown like that hurt him to do that.
[17082.82s -> 17083.78s]  Oh, I see.
[17083.78s -> 17084.66s]  You're picking on him.
[17087.17s -> 17089.28s]  That sucked.
[17093.31s -> 17093.79s]  Awful.
[17094.43s -> 17095.55s]  And yet he persists.
[17098.24s -> 17099.12s]  Play something else.
[17103.25s -> 17104.21s]  Not very good.
[17107.92s -> 17108.72s]  Holy shit.
[17109.36s -> 17110.58s]  He gets to live.
[17129.73s -> 17131.01s]  I don't want to talk about it either.
[17131.01s -> 17133.38s]  I'm I'm a math.
[17133.38s -> 17135.62s]  So you instantly kill the jar enemies,
[17135.62s -> 17137.70s]  but you'll leave the horn guy alone.
[17139.34s -> 17140.62s]  What you like the jar.
[17140.62s -> 17141.90s]  I didn't I didn't know that was it.
[17141.90s -> 17143.66s]  You never said like do not kill the jar.
[17144.86s -> 17145.66s]  Didn't need to be said.
[17145.66s -> 17146.22s]  Oh, okay.
[17146.22s -> 17147.10s]  Don't kill the rat.
[17147.10s -> 17151.20s]  You you kill your rat with a little rabies
[17151.20s -> 17153.44s]  and it has like a puss on it.
[17154.16s -> 17155.98s]  Sure.
[17155.98s -> 17156.94s]  Can you do this in real life?
[17158.11s -> 17158.35s]  What?
[17159.65s -> 17160.05s]  You know.
[17161.33s -> 17165.97s]  Can I fight a bear in real life?
[17166.05s -> 17167.73s]  He's not even a fan of Elden Ring.
[17168.45s -> 17174.75s]  What?
[17176.78s -> 17178.86s]  Dude, go go poke some lava, dude.
[17179.50s -> 17181.42s]  Don't act like that wouldn't be fun, please.
[17182.88s -> 17185.68s]  I think it'd be more fun to roast marshmallows over it.
[17185.68s -> 17187.76s]  It'd be fun just to kind of just do it is
[17187.76s -> 17189.68s]  I think just be like experience like a like oh,
[17192.14s -> 17193.42s]  oh my god, that was brutal.
[17194.30s -> 17196.22s]  That woman in a wheelchair.
[17197.90s -> 17198.14s]  What?
[17199.82s -> 17200.78s]  She can't walk.
[17201.58s -> 17202.94s]  Wait, she was in a wheelchair.
[17203.90s -> 17204.54s]  She should be.
[17205.82s -> 17206.70s]  But I was like, what do you do?
[17206.70s -> 17208.70s]  This isn't like Troll Knight sword.
[17209.66s -> 17217.94s]  Bro, you are fucked.
[17219.95s -> 17220.27s]  All right.
[17220.83s -> 17221.71s]  We're almost there.
[17226.18s -> 17227.54s]  I have low healing.
[17227.54s -> 17230.42s]  If this is a tough enemy and you're poised up.
[17230.98s -> 17231.54s]  Leave quick.
[17233.22s -> 17234.18s]  Jesus Christ.
[17234.90s -> 17235.62s]  I think you died.
[17235.62s -> 17236.10s]  I died.
[17237.70s -> 17240.50s]  My screen faded to black and then it pulled me back
[17240.50s -> 17242.66s]  and I was like, nah, dude, you're actually dead.
[17243.65s -> 17244.37s]  I have the grace.
[17244.37s -> 17245.17s]  I don't know if that matters.
[17246.88s -> 17252.43s]  I think we can warp to it.
[17252.43s -> 17256.37s]  Dude, I had 700,000 souls on me a lot.
[17257.26s -> 17265.33s]  Can you start a vote and you do it?
[17270.29s -> 17270.69s]  Yep.
[17270.69s -> 17272.66s]  Yeah.
[17272.66s -> 17273.62s]  Don't skip the cut scene.
[17273.62s -> 17274.02s]  We won't.
[17277.33s -> 17281.74s]  We start has been wanting to hear this guy talk for the last four streams.
[17281.74s -> 17283.42s]  I love this guy.
[17283.42s -> 17289.84s]  Is it going to be convenient if the rapture happens soon
[17289.84s -> 17292.32s]  and then you can get a volcano in Las Vegas
[17292.32s -> 17293.68s]  and then you could just do it there?
[17293.68s -> 17297.07s]  Why does the rapture have to happen?
[17299.12s -> 17299.68s]  All right.
[17299.68s -> 17300.48s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17301.12s -> 17301.76s]  They need to vote.
[17302.90s -> 17307.47s]  Oh, I'm just saying, would it be easier to wait for the rapture?
[17309.28s -> 17311.44s]  It would be easier just to take a vacation
[17312.51s -> 17317.71s]  than wait for humanity to end, I think, as the question you're asking.
[17317.71s -> 17323.34s]  Are you going to go on this vacation in the next year?
[17323.34s -> 17323.90s]  I don't know.
[17324.62s -> 17325.90s]  Do you think the world is going?
[17325.90s -> 17328.38s]  Do you think the rapture is going to happen in the next 12 months?
[17330.38s -> 17330.78s]  Probably.
[17330.78s -> 17331.58s]  Like, probably.
[17331.58s -> 17332.46s]  I'd say two years.
[17334.24s -> 17334.88s]  Actually, you know what?
[17334.88s -> 17336.48s]  I mean, this could be.
[17336.48s -> 17339.60s]  Let's start planning a vacation.
[17342.48s -> 17343.04s]  All right.
[17343.04s -> 17345.84s]  There's not very many nonbelievers, so.
[17346.96s -> 17348.40s]  I'm a blind samurai.
[17348.40s -> 17351.84s]  Let's go.
[17358.37s -> 17360.21s]  It's it's phase one.
[17361.49s -> 17363.06s]  It's Godfrey.
[17363.06s -> 17363.86s]  I can't enter.
[17363.86s -> 17365.94s]  I think you're in the cut scene that I've been wanting to watch.
[17369.89s -> 17371.71s]  There is no cut scene.
[17374.99s -> 17379.30s]  Godfrey Devouring Serpent.
[17379.30s -> 17382.34s]  It's a serpent that only likes to eat Godfrey's.
[17382.34s -> 17385.47s]  He's had one meal.
[17386.11s -> 17390.03s]  He's eaten once and it was enough.
[17390.03s -> 17392.99s]  Then the family found out that like, oh, they only eat Godfrey's.
[17392.99s -> 17394.75s]  Let's call our new son Godfrey.
[17396.03s -> 17404.35s]  He's probably got two phases.
[17404.35s -> 17404.99s]  Keep in mind.
[17405.63s -> 17406.43s]  That's true.
[17422.94s -> 17423.26s]  Quick.
[17436.99s -> 17438.27s]  Big smash.
[17439.82s -> 17442.62s]  That was so incredibly loud.
[17443.58s -> 17444.38s]  Actually was.
[17444.38s -> 17446.22s]  I wasn't going to say anything, but it was.
[17446.22s -> 17447.34s]  That was like you eating.
[17448.62s -> 17449.58s]  That was a big crunch.
[17453.98s -> 17455.42s]  This is a reenactment.
[17456.88s -> 17457.76s]  Oh, shit.
[17457.76s -> 17458.40s]  Oh, my God.
[17459.20s -> 17462.06s]  I'm just I'm just perma hit.
[17468.78s -> 17485.17s]  All I hear is, oh, oh, oh, my name is lagging to fucking shit, too.
[17489.30s -> 17491.78s]  It's really hard to dodge this when he's not doing them at you.
[17492.50s -> 17493.22s]  It actually is.
[17495.65s -> 17498.53s]  Oh, oh, oh, stir going down.
[17499.33s -> 17507.70s]  Okay.
[17507.70s -> 17508.50s]  Is there a phase two?
[17509.38s -> 17511.26s]  Please, mad soldier.
[17511.82s -> 17513.02s]  I'm out of healing.
[17513.02s -> 17520.30s]  Oh, together we shall be family or something.
[17520.30s -> 17520.86s]  I can't remember.
[17521.50s -> 17522.54s]  I'm watching the cut scene.
[17529.92s -> 17531.20s]  Who could it be, though?
[17532.00s -> 17539.71s]  For Dan, if it's for Dan, then we paid out a lot of money to the nonbelievers.
[17582.02s -> 17582.74s]  God looks like you.
[17584.58s -> 17587.22s]  You would talk over the exact moment where he says together.
[17592.91s -> 17594.75s]  It's oh, actually, this might suck.
[17594.75s -> 17595.47s]  It's margot.
[17600.93s -> 17601.49s]  Maybe not.
[17602.05s -> 17603.55s]  I think it'll be all right.
[17604.62s -> 17606.06s]  But doesn't Margot have a phase two?
[17606.06s -> 17608.70s]  Are we going to get like the phase two inception?
[17609.50s -> 17617.97s]  I'm like, that's what you mean.
[17620.56s -> 17621.36s]  Watch it on YouTube.
[17622.08s -> 17645.44s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking tomato at him.
[17651.76s -> 17653.76s]  He so badly wants you to die.
[17653.76s -> 17654.64s]  I have no help.
[17654.64s -> 17671.81s]  Oh, oh, he's got me.
[17673.23s -> 17674.91s]  Good thing I healed right there.
[17688.75s -> 17689.15s]  Epic.
[17689.15s -> 17708.81s]  believers let's go there's just four golden seeds I don't know what is with
[17708.81s -> 17714.38s]  my seed that I get all the seeds I'm guessing right there oh by the way rest

[17754.68s -> 17762.13s]  here that it will be some like right card will be in the DLC I don't know I
[17762.13s -> 17766.80s]  don't think there is DLC you just don't think that's gonna happen I think they
[17766.80s -> 17770.76s]  were gonna make deal if we just sold him another game I don't know give the
[17770.76s -> 17778.56s]  dancers you can move him move who you just were moving his head I can't see

[17821.56s -> 17847.14s]  the dancer I've never seen this what does this do so you can't see this at
[17847.14s -> 17852.66s]  all nope so what if I just kill her oh god that's worse than if you killed the

[17941.77s -> 17949.99s]  and hear me out sure what if we did it tomorrow and not do it tomorrow but
[17949.99s -> 17952.39s]  tomorrow is gonna be the day that we were gonna do it it was but when it
[17952.39s -> 17957.63s]  became when we decided that hey today we're doing it instead I made a specific
[17957.63s -> 17965.66s]  plan tomorrow without me well cuz we did we did it today you didn't ask for
[17965.66s -> 17974.16s]  permission if you could do it tomorrow I'm sorry you do you want you gotta go
[17974.16s -> 17980.91s]  we go I'm just it's I just feel like my general health and well-being all right
[17980.91s -> 17984.75s]  okay so then yeah then let's let's call it then let's call it if you general we
[17984.75s -> 17990.57s]  don't wanna wait this is the way so that that was a that was like oh hey
[17990.57s -> 17993.55s]  you having fun like what else we doing today that was your version of that I
[17993.55s -> 17998.44s]  think right like oh yeah this game Ember yeah it's like really fun but like hey
[17998.44s -> 18001.88s]  what else is going on that was that was your version of that no that was my
[18001.88s -> 18005.40s]  version of like we could just play tomorrow but now that playing tomorrow's
[18005.40s -> 18011.54s]  off the table because you took it away all right but like are you feeling all
[18011.54s -> 18015.58s]  right are you okay like we can stop right now if we stop playing I would
[18015.58s -> 18023.20s]  like eat a real meal and then I would honestly play Neo so it's fine are you
[18023.20s -> 18030.06s]  gonna stream Neo no god no no god no all right they'll tell me that I missed a
[18030.06s -> 18034.06s]  key pulse and I'll just it'll send me over the edge he wants to play Neo I
[18034.06s -> 18041.53s]  what you know explain you he wants to play a neo so bad all right well then
[18041.53s -> 18045.53s]  hello wait wait I have a proposition proposition for you okay proposition if
[18045.53s -> 18049.92s]  you want to play let's let's just go beat the game that will not take us
[18049.92s -> 18055.22s]  very long but then that means we're never playing again my what I wanted to
[18055.22s -> 18058.18s]  do is play tomorrow and what you're suggesting is to go beat the game so we
[18058.18s -> 18072.09s]  never have to play it again I mean that's not necessarily true it's just
[18072.09s -> 18078.71s]  when would you want to play again like if we're not playing tomorrow like we're
[18078.71s -> 18081.83s]  not playing tomorrow when would you like to play like another weekend thing like
[18081.83s -> 18088.02s]  Saturday and that's a long time that's kind of a long time like you just want
[18088.02s -> 18096.54s]  it we can go in the Elden tree now can we I mean we could we could just pick it
[18096.54s -> 18101.58s]  up again at some point and just in the next few days or something we don't have
[18101.58s -> 18105.98s]  to play it anymore we could just stop for now and just in like I don't know a
[18105.98s -> 18110.30s]  few days and like we don't have to wait till the weekend well I thought we had
[18110.30s -> 18117.90s]  to go through like the destroyed Landell we do when does that happen I think we
[18117.90s -> 18125.65s]  have to kill Malika who is inferno let's do Farrah Missoula man but they they
[18125.65s -> 18132.28s]  want it I I let me make this really really clear I am willing to play again
[18132.28s -> 18135.80s]  some other time in the next big this week or something if you really if you
[18135.80s -> 18141.94s]  want to get food and like just leave that's all good no I'm fine okay I'm
[18141.94s -> 18148.10s]  fine I'm just very you know like very sad you just did the the Neo case is on
[18148.10s -> 18152.18s]  your desk and you keep like looking at it I thought I wasn't gonna play Neo
[18152.18s -> 18156.34s]  until we beat Elden Ring because I don't want to mess up my brain again so then
[18156.34s -> 18160.41s]  okay so the next time we play this just let's beat this let's complete it so
[18160.41s -> 18165.60s]  then it's a complete arc and then we're good to go and we do whatever you can
[18165.60s -> 18169.26s]  just go back to playing a yo and whatever and then we're never gonna talk
[18169.26s -> 18177.24s]  again I'm and I'm already in the best timeline right now let's go to
[18177.24s -> 18185.13s]  Farrah Missoula I just don't know what he wants I'm saying what I want I'm saying
[18185.13s -> 18195.26s]  let's go to Farrah Missoula I'm going to do I'm going every art must be finite

[18208.31s -> 18211.95s]  playing he wanted to call it which makes complete been perfectly understand I
[18211.95s -> 18216.27s]  only wanted to call it because I thought we were playing tomorrow oh okay we're

[18718.37s -> 18725.54s]  millennia really I think we'll be all right we're pretty level I think he's
[18725.54s -> 18731.30s]  lower HP probably but like this guy she's why do I feel like half the bosses
[18731.30s -> 18739.86s]  we fought had this music I feel like it was the only music we've heard this is
[18739.86s -> 18760.86s]  the Elden ring boss music for all we are concerned this guy's attacks are just
[18760.86s -> 18764.38s]  totally random at least millennia goes up in the air and lets you know she's
[18764.38s -> 18767.86s]  gonna do some bullshit this guy's just like constantly spinning in circles and
[18767.86s -> 18770.98s]  summoning guys and there's frostbite everywhere and you can't see your screen
[18770.98s -> 18778.43s]  that's like a thousand particle effects and he's got the boys with him not
[18778.43s -> 18781.51s]  anymore what is he even doing right now what is he doing
[18781.55s -> 18786.11s]  it's a big what is the big circle splash and then he goes down and you have an
[18786.11s -> 18798.25s]  opportunity to hit him well did you yes look at her honestly how is this guy
[18798.25s -> 18812.05s]  not Elden fucking Lord it doesn't want it horror Lou is a naked guy he seems to
[18812.05s -> 18820.86s]  be doing this move a lot though would you would you do any other move maybe
[18820.86s -> 18871.16s]  well at least it doesn't heal when he hits you they should why me I'm out of
[18871.64s -> 18902.79s]  we got it don't worry I'm here I'm here thanks big bro see nothing bad yeah well
[18902.79s -> 18925.90s]  millennia was actually easier it's a lot of souls holy shit actually can do it
[18925.90s -> 18933.78s]  again and do it a couple more times actually can't I 60 strength do it oh
[18933.78s -> 18947.81s]  yeah let's go oh yeah yeah okay cool wrong door where my my souls in here no
[18948.01s -> 18956.80s]  I got out yeah we got a bell free key another one is this the wrong way too

[18980.21s -> 18984.74s]  lot of people die on those stairs this way that way this way that way this is
[18984.74s -> 18991.03s]  the wrong way I was listening to you your first mistake when he said it last
[18991.03s -> 18999.10s]  honestly stir is scarier than Jerma scarier reading I'm just reading what
[18999.10s -> 19014.93s]  they said what have I done that's scary I don't know I think it's cuz the shit
[19014.93s -> 19018.13s]  your pants story well I think that they're having trouble getting over that
[19018.13s -> 19027.54s]  this is not the right way this is just like regular Zula there that's the guy
[19027.54s -> 19043.23s]  that it's the other door other other door it's his vibes they're just
[19043.31s -> 19057.93s]  off about his vibes are off and then we can go yeah kind of we don't do we go
[19057.93s -> 19063.37s]  around here we have to go up around to without bridges to go to where hold on

[19571.49s -> 19576.25s]  seemed like everybody was making a VR game everybody was making the League of
[19576.25s -> 19582.13s]  Legends kind of you know pop down game there's been like five years from now
[19582.13s -> 19586.27s]  there's gonna be like six Elden Ring likes come out because everyone got like
[19586.27s -> 19590.25s]  all do this game so good let's make one all at the same time I like that kind of
[19590.25s -> 19595.06s]  started happening like a lot I mean they made a Star Wars game that was like a
[19595.06s -> 19604.84s]  souls like I think which one did I fall in order is a souls like I guess I mean
[19604.84s -> 19612.51s]  it is I never played it but it seemed that way it is 100% a souls like they're
[19612.51s -> 19618.41s]  just called action RPGs dude no I you cannot tell me that fallen order is not
[19618.41s -> 19655.66s]  supposed to be a souls like come on it is oh you want to um you want to just go
[19655.66s -> 19665.02s]  check and see if it's if it was down here yeah can we even activate it this
[19665.02s -> 19679.22s]  is I think so you just lay down in it get the bonfire first though for sure you
[19679.22s -> 19685.78s]  just have to lie down that's good just have to lie down and let it happen where
[19685.78s -> 19692.59s]  is the bonfire we miss it I don't know if there's like an elevator around here
[19692.59s -> 19703.38s]  oh it's right here on the elevator all right I'll send it back for you no I'm
[19703.38s -> 19709.73s]  good I'm nice like that I'll set it back for you that play secure oh I did I
[19709.73s -> 19718.74s]  completed secure oh I beat the whole thing true ending and that game was a
[19718.74s -> 19726.57s]  living hell oh on that note you're asking like secure over near or was
[19726.57s -> 19729.81s]  harder right I feel like there's some people in chat like to case you stop
[19729.81s -> 19736.29s]  bringing up but like you did ask no I did the game is harder than secure oh
[19736.29s -> 19742.21s]  for sure why do they all come in here they all heard you these are people in
[19742.21s -> 19748.50s]  chat that were very mad that you just said that yeah I know no no but people
[19748.78s -> 19753.10s]  Neo being harder was I think the general consensus when you brought it up or five
[19753.10s -> 19758.82s]  yeah and and I can confirm I was like yeah this was uh was the safe place to
[19758.82s -> 19768.67s]  drop wait is if I gotta go down just jump dude no go down the hero is the
[19768.67s -> 19772.55s]  easiest from software game secure is easier than Elden ring I don't think so
[19772.55s -> 19788.28s]  I feel like secure oh punishes you way more than Elden ring does if you miss a
[19788.32s -> 19793.87s]  couple of those parries you can just get caught and just you dead it's over we
[19793.87s -> 19808.30s]  have to go I think we have to cross yeah it's like you I'm seriously just jumped
[19808.30s -> 19811.06s]  right there I'm doing the fucking hard one you didn't you did the one on the
[19811.06s -> 19818.49s]  left it was easy I thought there was like a whole different area of where you

[19913.04s -> 19918.14s]  I don't know something like something weird with my stomach I don't know what
[19918.14s -> 19925.98s]  it is or why you ever been check for worms nah I don't see why I would all

[21214.43s -> 21223.80s]  if we did stealth what do you mean what if we like like we just stealth in
[21223.80s -> 21227.93s]  because we know where he is and we backstab him no what we need to just
[21227.93s -> 21231.09s]  stand over here let's just fight him over here but like you have to actually
[21231.09s -> 21234.49s]  fight no no stay right here just stay right here he's gonna do right now he's

[21252.03s -> 21258.62s]  know why he fell off like his normal arena has places he can jump off he's
[21258.62s -> 21274.18s]  so pissed over over here actually not a bad space place for him to be oh he
[21274.18s -> 21317.35s]  almost did it he actually almost did it how does he know oh here he goes there
[21317.35s -> 21329.04s]  he goes he's dead see you later he does the jumps on the pillars and it's like
[21329.04s -> 21334.62s]  he tried to jump to another pillar that didn't exist it just did a wily coyote
[21334.62s -> 21361.00s]  straight down nice I saw bullshit there shouldn't be ring outs okay there is
[21361.00s -> 21365.00s]  still an opportunity for this to go really wrong and if it's radan is there's
[21365.00s -> 21376.94s]  only two more opportunities praying for a mad soldier he'll be on the horse too
[21376.94s -> 21387.87s]  won't he that's gonna be a disaster yeah just wait it's gonna be so
[21387.87s -> 21391.87s]  anticlimactic we're gonna get to we're gonna get an urn tree avatar and then an
[21391.87s -> 21398.12s]  urn tree avatar that's kind of I really want it to just be like just said you

[21425.36s -> 21431.44s]  equal chance here for it to be radan and we can't beat this for six hours or
[21431.44s -> 21445.88s]  snail and it's free I remember this one should be two phases as well yep radan
[21445.88s -> 21451.58s]  is easy not in the area we're about to go to also when you say that statement
[21451.58s -> 21472.29s]  remember that we're both bad also very true it cleaned this one all right that's
[21472.29s -> 21479.48s]  her in we can should we take a peek or should we just walk in I just walk in

[21562.67s -> 21576.34s]  I'm focused on I gotta stop does he have Godfrey's axe no no I think you can do

[21641.33s -> 21650.88s]  I think you could are you could be the older Lord usually this is gonna be
[21650.88s -> 21657.20s]  pretty rough I don't think it's impossible but if don't say it but if
[21657.20s -> 21662.80s]  we're Dan is phase two I gotta say I'm impressed the lore lines up seamless
[21662.80s -> 21669.66s]  co-op but we're gonna be joint Eldon Lords accurate like yeah Eldon Lords are
[21669.66s -> 21675.74s]  always couples apparently it's like a it's weird it's in the lore I mean it's
[21675.90s -> 21682.62s]  my hand we run back up there did you not spawn here well why don't I wait why am
[21682.62s -> 21689.94s]  I spawned a little bit did I not touch the bonfire you might not have title

[21698.97s -> 21704.49s]  long as you don't insta die I mean it wasn't it was just in fact hold on I
[21704.49s -> 21726.70s]  don't even have any poison policies I don't if we really really focus the if
[21726.70s -> 21730.58s]  we do a big big focus on the first one damage damage damage I think we're
[21730.58s -> 21736.60s]  right like before he moved we just you know he just did a lot of damage yeah
[21736.60s -> 21749.09s]  all right let's go for it let's go bucko oh okay and let's sync it up again give

[21776.28s -> 21781.24s]  he hits half health yeah if we can both fight one that would be ideal he's gonna
[21781.24s -> 21792.46s]  co-op us which is cheating all right here he comes no oh shit poison oh shit
[21792.46s -> 21798.26s]  poison I'm poisoned I'm fighting the other one I have aggro you just focus on

[22506.09s -> 22511.13s]  no animals in here no there's no animals I think this is the the like lesser

[22544.48s -> 22562.86s]  wild oh stop me off imagine voting no yeah I would put my hand through my
[22562.94s -> 22586.67s]  moderate but the music too is perfect stop doing that this really just wants
[22586.67s -> 22624.65s]  the string to keep going oh god damn it he's so like wiggly by the way from
[22624.65s -> 22633.32s]  person who gets the last hit is the Eldon Lord so it works oh he's so far
[22633.32s -> 22656.25s]  away I got robbed yes my yes my lord that's my first rule put on these
[22656.25s -> 22673.09s]  cat ears it's rubber touches it damn it you just he he gets to make all the
[22673.09s -> 22685.40s]  rules now you put on the cat ears I was born for this that's the worst day for
[22685.40s -> 22691.09s]  doubters you had a pretty good chance I'll be honest we're Dan still in the
[22691.25s -> 22698.14s]  mix radigan still in the my voice is just gone screaming for like six hours
[22698.14s -> 22706.84s]  yeah even say a lot of weird stuff maybe a dragon to a dragon in that first area
[22706.84s -> 22718.55s]  would have been pretty terrible what ending did we even get Dongita we didn't
[22718.55s -> 22741.82s]  do anything put the head in the cup bowing me like I don't know
[22750.04s -> 22760.12s]  became that vote must have been like more than 50% assuming we would lose
[22760.12s -> 22767.86s]  between now it was it was 26 million versus 31 million 31 was no a lot of
[22767.86s -> 22772.78s]  people lost points right there that's 31 million points gone from whoever had
[22772.78s -> 22795.30s]  him mimic tear it's like that's probably underneath soldier of Godric that
[22795.38s -> 22816.40s]  secret ending what wait what oh we died that's that's half a million souls gone
[22816.40s -> 22826.35s]  by the way unfortunate oh that's not good all right I was gonna change the
[22826.35s -> 22830.23s]  world I became Eldon Lord and then I accidentally no clipped through the earth
[22830.23s -> 22844.53s]  all that power I know what to do with it let's respect our bill one last time you
[22844.53s -> 22850.91s]  know actually know we can do can we actually go and do the via boss as well
[22850.91s -> 22869.60s]  I guess right I guess now do PvP PvP for true Eldon Lord I don't know how we how
[22869.60s -> 22873.08s]  do we would we even fight each other same way that we did it accidentally
[22873.08s -> 22882.64s]  before okay don't don't we have like a third party my guy doing I don't know
[22882.64s -> 22887.00s]  are you controlling him your character no no I pressed be be held and I just
[22887.00s -> 22889.92s]  started walking at her but then I missed because you like walked in front
[22889.92s -> 22904.65s]  of her I wanted to be held let me be held no let me in here please let me in
[22904.65s -> 22945.85s]  here it's weird I didn't do anything okay we're missing the item oh my god
[22945.89s -> 22960.76s]  when you hit her she bursts broken in this mod owned all right well then you
[22960.76s -> 22964.88s]  got what you want it we don't have to play anymore hey it's not what I said
[22964.88s -> 22976.28s]  it's over forever hey it's not goodbye it's I'll see you in a few years maybe
[22976.28s -> 22986.92s]  alright 2025 is there anything you want to clean up where you want to go how do
[22986.92s -> 22995.43s]  you feel now I mean we can't really just go backwards after you kill the
[22995.43s -> 22999.17s]  mimic to your Eldon Lord that's true the only thing we would find was radan
[22999.17s -> 23007.46s]  wherever radan was or ratagon which is probably no cron if we went to go fight
[23007.46s -> 23013.31s]  Moog I feel like that would be radon and probably if it was like both of them
[23013.31s -> 23017.47s]  because it seemed to be putting the strong bosses and strong boss places
[23017.47s -> 23025.10s]  true that's the true ending fight well that was really fun that was actually a
[23025.10s -> 23033.24s]  really good time a pleasure all good things all all art must be finite yeah
[23033.24s -> 23046.38s]  let Nexon publish Elden Ring online is that's fun that was the seamless co-op
[23046.38s -> 23053.32s]  seamless co-op works pretty flawlessly we the only problems we had were very
[23053.32s -> 23059.36s]  very just minor basic very very easy to fix problems like oh my game crashed
[23059.36s -> 23063.76s]  once every few hours or something it's really not a big deal there were really
[23063.76s -> 23071.36s]  like none today too and it was really smooth as mod makers give round of
[23071.36s -> 23079.31s]  applause without without the person made this mod we can't do seamless co-op like
[23079.31s -> 23086.86s]  this it goes for anybody yeah all joke ending yeah it was perfect
[23087.02s -> 23092.62s]  all right dude hey what do you have to do it like we could do whatever you want
[23092.62s -> 23096.27s]  to play something I don't know we'll figure something out if we place them
[23096.27s -> 23103.56s]  again we'll always figure something out always yeah literally always good night
[23103.56s -> 23112.00s]  yeah take care see you later Esther do neo 2 co-op I don't think I want to play
[23112.00s -> 23124.64s]  neo 2 I don't think it's for me they're never gonna talk again hey that's not
[23124.64s -> 23131.37s]  true we literally just played that firefighter game like two weeks ago yeah
[23131.41s -> 23142.20s]  that's fun the next time I'll see you will be let's see here probably Wednesday
[23142.20s -> 23148.75s]  or Thursday we're gonna do another chill stream there's a few games that they
[23148.75s -> 23154.50s]  just want to relax and play so keep an eye on the sauce at the latest Thursday
[23154.50s -> 23161.28s]  and then we'll probably do something this weekend to do house flipper
[23161.28s -> 23171.63s]  randomizer yeah the mod it was just randomizer and seamless co-op and we've
[23171.63s -> 23176.06s]  got about the typing test don't worry we'll do it we'll do it there has to be
[23176.06s -> 23184.41s]  here for it though but that's it there was a game completion figured we
[23184.41s -> 23189.53s]  probably had an opportunity to beat it tonight so there it is see you guys
[23189.53s -> 23196.21s]  later have a great rest of your weekend it's probably over but have a good
