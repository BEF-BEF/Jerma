[22.33s -> 33.38s]  You know, it seemed like it was potentially a funny idea. I was gonna- I didn't want to delay
[33.38s -> 43.02s]  the stream though. Oh damn it. Don't freak- don't freak out. That's what they say, don't freak out.
[43.02s -> 50.20s]  I wonder if I can reach back here. I've been sitting here like this for at least 30 minutes.
[51.77s -> 55.74s]  I put- I put chicken grease in my hair! Wait a minute.
[67.83s -> 76.87s]  Nice swag, thanks. You look like a Space Channel 5. You can see every like,
[76.95s -> 85.61s]  inch of my face too. I don't like this. I hate this. Oh! Holy shit, people are so ugly with light,
[85.61s -> 91.45s]  aren't they? Holy shit, people are so ugly. Look at- all right. Oh, Jeremy, you look real handsome
[91.45s -> 104.42s]  today. You sure about that? People are ugly with light on them. So I- I think we just have to stream.
[104.42s -> 120.30s]  Wait, what do these buttons do? What does this button do? Like a depiction of an angel in the
[120.30s -> 135.83s]  Bible or something. It's like I just be like, like, yes my son. Like, yes. Are you okay? I'm
[135.83s -> 141.99s]  all right. I gotta shave though. You can see how weird I look. All right, let's go ahead and uh...
[145.35s -> 156.25s]  Whoa! Holy, are you kidding me? Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. See? I'm not ugly!
[159.93s -> 167.21s]  I can't even use this now. You want to see me fucked up? Watch this, ready?
[169.75s -> 177.91s]  Everyone looks like that, okay? Anyways, wait, I need to keep this on. No, I don't. Turn it off.
[177.91s -> 189.94s]  I got it off. The chicken grease worked. Hey, I'll be live in two seconds. It's dual personality.
[194.06s -> 196.54s]  Oh shit, that's probably loud. Sorry. All right. Hey, stream's starting.
[200.78s -> 212.52s]  Where's Shito? I don't- what? No, there's no Shito today. Shito needs batteries to turn his brain
[212.52s -> 224.39s]  back on and I don't have the batteries that are required. You took Shito off the shelf?
[225.29s -> 240.34s]  No, I didn't. What are you talking about? He's right there. He's sleeping. He's sleeping. See?
[251.59s -> 264.65s]  I can hear it. Can you hear it? Hey, oh, okay. Geez, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. I haven't
[264.65s -> 278.07s]  turned him on in like two years. Yeah, I know. Well, you can go back to sleep for a little while.
[278.63s -> 283.96s]  All right, all right, set it on. Set it on. Stop, stop. All right, I get it. I get it.
[285.70s -> 295.56s]  I'll- okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay. So, shh. Okay, back to sleep. Uh, he said he's very
[295.56s -> 299.16s]  grateful that everyone thought he was cool and that people were happy that he was going to make
[299.16s -> 306.25s]  a return. He was mad that I kept him asleep for two years. I did say that- I said I was going like a
[306.25s -> 310.22s]  long weekend trip two and a half years ago and I was like, oh, we'll just shut you off for a
[310.22s -> 319.66s]  little while. And it's been two years. I will get you new batteries, Shito. Bumber for a little
[319.66s -> 328.81s]  longer. Hey, we're starting the stream soon. Just a minute. Did you smoke crack? What? I don't smoke
[328.81s -> 332.73s]  crack. I don't smoke crack. I don't smoke crack. I don't smoke a crack. I don't smoke crack.
[343.30s -> 349.22s]  He's role playing and he's 36. Who cares? Does that- why? Does that even matter?
[354.84s -> 360.92s]  I can't role play at 36? Okay, well then every actor has to retire when they turn 30. How does
[360.92s -> 370.66s]  that sound? Today, we're gonna- I know I lied. I'm sorry. It will never be an actor. There would
[370.66s -> 377.21s]  never be like a- like an old man in any movie or TV show you ever watch ever again. It'll be people
[377.21s -> 389.42s]  that are like 30 and like 40 in makeup. Okay, so we're gonna play Internet Cafe Simulator 2 today.
[392.90s -> 402.89s]  I know I lied. I said we're gonna play Everhood. I'm really sorry, but I kind of- ow. I- listen,
[402.89s -> 408.07s]  I kind of had a headache and Everhood is a game I don't think you want to play with a headache,
[409.91s -> 415.03s]  but I've seen some of this game. It looks like it could be interesting. It seems kind of up my alley.
[415.67s -> 421.62s]  I was like, I want to try it. It's a simulator game. Fart Simu- I know.
[422.42s -> 432.78s]  I don't- why would I need to explain it to you? This game is not a game you want to play with
[432.78s -> 441.50s]  a headache either. Why? Yeah, I'm having a good time. I'm just hanging out. Hopefully,
[441.50s -> 452.38s]  you're doing okay too. Pretty cool. This is a simulator game. I beat this in the entire time.
[452.38s -> 459.90s]  I was just wishing I could see you play it. I'm excited. Oh, that's good. You lost 4,000 people.
[460.62s -> 476.82s]  No, I did not. I have my analytics open. I can see my analytics. All right, so let's get started.
[478.18s -> 486.76s]  Let me just stir my coffee not into the microphone. How do you feel about being
[486.76s -> 498.31s]  called an e-clown? I- we made that term up here. That's not- somebody didn't make that term up
[498.87s -> 507.72s]  and then call me that. Like, that's like a- like, only a few communities even use that term.
[509.94s -> 517.88s]  So, who cares? All right. Uh, hold on. Let me get this going here.
[521.62s -> 527.74s]  I don't even have my dashboard open. What an idiot. Play the game? It's the intro.
[527.74s -> 538.68s]  I just- just give me a second. Oh, there we go. There we go. Okay. Uh, is the camera still on?
[539.24s -> 548.97s]  No. No cam. Off. Is it gonna be a ring light neck stream? Uh, no, I'm not gonna- I'm not
[548.97s -> 558.57s]  gonna torture myself like that. There was also a heated debate in the chat room earlier about
[558.57s -> 569.30s]  hamburger helper and I- I- I feel like I need to- we have to talk about it. I got a lot of shit
[569.86s -> 577.29s]  because- all right, let me ask a really quick question. Do you guys know, in the chat,
[577.29s -> 584.31s]  ones in the chat, do you know what hamburger helper is? Because apparently it was fucking crazy
[584.31s -> 589.24s]  that I- I've been saying- was saying these words. I was like, yeah, a hamburger helper. You get the
[589.24s -> 592.52s]  cheeseburger mac and what you do is you do this, you do this. Everyone's like, what are you talking
[592.52s -> 602.10s]  about? What- what is hamburger helper? What- what help what? It's good, yeah. And I was talking
[602.10s -> 608.10s]  about a little recipe that I had. If you don't know what hamburger- this is what it looks like.
[608.10s -> 617.11s]  It doesn't look like that. Uh, it doesn't look like that. It looks like this. Um, so that's
[617.11s -> 629.27s]  hamburger helper. People would like show us the box. That's- there's the box. I can't even like
[629.27s -> 635.90s]  not laugh at that. What was that? It was- I don't know. It was like an image on my desktop. It comes
[635.90s -> 642.55s]  with real cheese. Okay, this is what hamburger- listen. Hamburger helper is a boxed macaroni
[642.55s -> 649.11s]  product. You take a pound of ground beef and you mix it in with this whole box and it turns into
[649.11s -> 657.00s]  this macaroni dish, right? It looks like this. This one here. Uh, this is a good one. Yeah,
[657.00s -> 665.72s]  this one. It looks like that. It tastes- it's- I mean, okay, the entire time you're making
[665.72s -> 670.15s]  hamburger helper, you're grossed out. It's disgusting looking. It feels gross. It's like
[670.15s -> 674.62s]  you hate it and like you don't even like looking at it. But when you take a bite, it's hard not
[674.62s -> 681.54s]  to eat the whole box. Um, at least, you know, between a few people. So what I said- well,
[681.54s -> 691.40s]  what should I put- let me name this. Um, oh, right. EXP and espresso. It's the name of the
[691.40s -> 702.22s]  cafe. What are you talking about? That's hamburger helper. Is it actually a stolen name? No, it's not.
[702.22s -> 711.74s]  From where? It looks worse though. No, but okay. So you take the hamburger helper, you eat it,
[711.74s -> 714.86s]  maybe you put a little bit of onion in it, maybe you put some, you know, parsley, whatever the
[714.86s -> 719.10s]  hell you want, some of the bullshit to make it taste a little better, be a little nicer, whatever.
[719.10s -> 723.82s]  But my case that I was making to pretty stream chat was what I do, because you ha- you don't
[723.82s -> 731.37s]  just make like half a box of hamburger helper, right? You don't just make one like, oh, I'm
[731.37s -> 735.51s]  going to make like a third of a box of hamburger helper. It doesn't work that way. So you make a
[735.51s -> 742.65s]  shitload of it and then you store it. And what I said is after you take it out, after you store it,
[742.65s -> 748.74s]  you put it between two pieces of bread or two pieces of toasted bread or bun and you eat it
[748.74s -> 754.23s]  like a sandwich. You heat it up, you heat the hamburger helper up in the microwave for like
[754.23s -> 758.57s]  20 seconds or something. And then you put it between bread and you eat it. And then you put
[758.57s -> 763.18s]  some ketchup on the side and you dip it in the ketchup. I- okay. Even my mods are like,
[763.18s -> 771.38s]  you're fucked up. But that's eating the leftovers though. Okay, you can adapt to the game in a
[771.38s -> 778.12s]  shorter time. Okay, don't worry, they're not boring and long. Yeah, WC, yeah, tab, skills, skills.
[778.12s -> 789.05s]  Okay, I have a punch. That sensitivity is going to go way down. Uh, even more than that. Yeah,
[789.05s -> 799.40s]  you dip it in ketchup. That's better. But it makes the, honestly, it makes the leftovers more
[799.40s -> 811.06s]  interesting. No joke, that sounds really good because it is. I have a punch. Oh, I tried to get
[811.06s -> 822.18s]  my girlfriend to take a bite and she did not want to. In fact, I got a really, really bad look.
[822.18s -> 837.48s]  I don't- it's just leftovers. How do I press- call the elevator, okay. Just be- I have weird- I have
[837.48s -> 844.28s]  a weird palate sometimes. It's a current- yes, it's a current girlfriend. It's a current girlfriend.
[846.52s -> 854.42s]  I alluded- all right. I alluded to this on Christmas Eve and I think it's time to talk about
[854.42s -> 861.43s]  it. I have a girlfriend. I've had a girlfriend since early last year. I've been pretty private
[861.43s -> 872.84s]  about it for a magnitude of reasons. But ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to announce, she's in
[872.84s -> 882.34s]  the chat right now. Where can we meet her? She's here now. And the reason why we kept it private
[882.34s -> 889.80s]  is because we wanted to- we wanted to find a good place to do this because I didn't want to kind of
[889.80s -> 895.14s]  just throw her into this whole thing and have it be like, oh hey, come on, everybody, you all know
[895.14s -> 901.42s]  who this is? She's a community member and she's been a community member for a while. This is not
[901.42s -> 913.88s]  a joke. It's Halulu. She's in chat right now. It's not you, it's her. It's not- it's not community Jake.
[913.88s -> 924.47s]  Does she know? What? She does. And ever since Christmas Eve, I've- I know people like, what are
[924.47s -> 929.40s]  you- what are you talking about? What does that mean? How do I get out of the fucking elevator?
[929.40s -> 941.75s]  Do you guys kiss? Of course we do. But I will say this, all through 2020 and into 2021, right,
[941.75s -> 948.30s]  I think I've been dropping some hints to you guys about how much better my personal life was getting.
[948.30s -> 952.70s]  You've probably seen a few different times where I've been like, hey, it's, you know, somewhere like
[952.70s -> 958.70s]  at some point last year where I was like, hey, my personal life is going really well. I'm really
[958.70s -> 966.15s]  happy right now. She had a lot to do with that. So, um, we were trying to find the right way to,
[966.15s -> 973.30s]  like, introduce her. She's fucking amazing. So, taking Andy, that's it. All right, I gotta get
[973.30s -> 991.99s]  out of my fucking apartment. How do I leave? Okay, here we go. Is this an elaborate bit? It is not
[991.99s -> 1008.44s]  an elaborate bit. But how do I go up the elevator? What- what do I do? Two? One? What? Where am I? I
[1008.44s -> 1021.62s]  thought I was- I'm already on the third floor? I thought I wasn't like- oh, okay. Let's go.
[1024.20s -> 1028.36s]  But all through 2021, I kept my private life pretty private. I was only streaming, like,
[1028.36s -> 1038.28s]  once a week. My health was in the fucking shitter. You all know that. Squid game? All right,
[1038.28s -> 1047.11s]  go to the- go to your internet cafe. Press M. BTC Miner? Okay, that's my home. This is my cafe.
[1047.11s -> 1053.27s]  I'm ready to fucking rock and roll. All right, can I- I can punch people. I know that for a fact.
[1061.30s -> 1068.22s]  Wait, this is the sus guy. Don't tell her that. She already knows that. But you'll probably be
[1068.22s -> 1073.37s]  seeing a lot more of her in the future because obviously I wanted to wait until we were both
[1073.37s -> 1078.90s]  comfortable kind of talking about it. So, there you go. There's your- there's your girlfriend
[1078.90s -> 1084.09s]  announcement. What the fuck are you doing? All right, so where's- where's my cafe up here?
[1092.44s -> 1106.31s]  Does anybody care that I just did that? All right, should I hide? That was rude. All right,
[1106.31s -> 1109.35s]  grab the mop and clean your cafe. This cleaning this game. So yeah, you know, I'm gonna fucking
[1109.35s -> 1123.06s]  love it. Any plans for her to feature on the stream? Um, if she wants to- and that's another
[1123.06s -> 1129.03s]  thing too. I didn't want to like- the reason to keep a relationship private is because obviously
[1129.03s -> 1134.57s]  you guys know- and I'm- this is real talk here. This is really just me being real. I live a pretty
[1134.57s -> 1142.30s]  private life. Besides, like, the public, you know, streams and stuff. So, I like to separate that
[1142.30s -> 1145.90s]  kind of stuff. But if she ever wanted to do something like that, I'm sure that we could-
[1145.90s -> 1155.53s]  it would be fun, yeah. He's an enigma. Not- I'm really not, though. Like, that's the thing. I'm
[1155.53s -> 1179.61s]  really not- I'm really not that complicated. I'm pretty simple. We know. All right, so it's clean.
[1179.61s -> 1188.73s]  Very cool. We call her the sus lady. I- I don't- I- well, I mean, she's here right now. You
[1188.73s -> 1191.53s]  literally- you can ask her. She's in the chat. I don't think she wants to be called the sus lady,
[1191.53s -> 1197.03s]  though. The electricity's off. All right, let's turn on the electricity. How do I use the computer?
[1197.03s -> 1206.47s]  There's space to start the computer. No electricity. Oh. How do I turn the electricity on?
[1213.13s -> 1229.40s]  Oh, shit. All right. I computer case monitor and keyboard mouse on the Xamibzor. Why did you
[1231.24s -> 1242.71s]  announce your girlfriend while playing Fart Simulator? What? I- I don't know. We're talking
[1242.71s -> 1248.07s]  about a hamburger helper, and, like, I- she was literally in this house. We were eating it,
[1248.07s -> 1264.02s]  and I was- I figured it was a good point. I have a good place to do it. You're feeding her hamburger
[1264.02s -> 1270.34s]  helper. I'm not feeding- look, she can eat whatever she wants. We eat together. We eat
[1270.34s -> 1275.46s]  whatever we want. Nobody has to eat hamburger helper sandwiches dipped in ketchup. I just had
[1275.46s -> 1286.38s]  to validate the fact that it was- this is a real thing I was doing. Okay, buy compute from Xamibzor.
[1286.38s -> 1297.14s]  War cry? Crack? No, there's- do I have money? All right, Xamibzor. Where's my money? I got
[1297.14s -> 1306.04s]  two thousand bucks. All right, all right, all right. Computer cases. Buy a computer case. What-
[1306.04s -> 1312.95s]  do I care which one it is? Old computer case. Add to basket. Is it there?
[1314.47s -> 1330.60s]  Uh, computer case, monitor, and keyboard. Keyboard and a mouse. This thing looks like a cell phone
[1330.60s -> 1342.30s]  from, like, 1992. 1991. All right, now what? All right. Why am I, like, in 800 by 600 resolution?
[1342.30s -> 1351.06s]  This is about the same dev that made Streamer Life Simulator. I have no idea, actually. That's a good
[1351.06s -> 1370.62s]  question. All right, so get up. Does she know about Otto? She loves Otto. Okay, so- this is a
[1370.62s -> 1379.78s]  guy I punched in the face. Why is he just sitting here? All right, that was kind of scary. What
[1379.78s -> 1388.42s]  happened? What is going on? Why is this- why is this guy walking over here with an exclamation
[1388.42s -> 1396.04s]  point? Why are there so many just animals? Press E to talk to the beggar. I know everything that
[1396.04s -> 1399.88s]  happens in this city, man. You're the owner of that new internet cafe. They smashed the man who
[1399.88s -> 1405.00s]  worked at the cafe before you, man. If he got on- if he got on well with me, this wouldn't have
[1405.00s -> 1409.88s]  happened to him. If you want to build BTC mining rig in this city, you have to pay me license
[1409.88s -> 1435.67s]  first. I want to just run an internet cafe, man. Is she taller than you? Oh, okay. No. All right,
[1435.67s -> 1442.71s]  old computer ca- where do I have to put this? This guy just keeps looking at me. I don't- I don't-
[1442.71s -> 1449.62s]  this is freaking me out. Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I get it. I get it. No, I get it. I
[1449.62s -> 1458.52s]  understand. I want to put it, like, here. I don't- this is- this is it? This is a tiny room. This is
[1458.52s -> 1473.85s]  a bathroom. Where's the- where's the- what happened to the stuff? Oh, it was, like, blending into the
[1473.85s -> 1488.07s]  ground. All right, keyboard. And then I assume that I have to put the- what about a monitor?
[1488.07s -> 1498.10s]  Oh, shit, I need a- I don't have a monitor. All right, I gotta get a monitor. Did you guys come up
[1498.10s -> 1505.26s]  with Grotto Beast together? Yes, we did. We were actually sitting just outside with a hammer,
[1505.26s -> 1512.20s]  breaking geodes, and we thought this was, like, a really cool idea. And you've- you've seen a lot of
[1512.20s -> 1518.34s]  her stuff. Okay, you remember the sunflowers? I've been, like, dropping hints about this for,
[1518.34s -> 1524.25s]  like, at least the last six fucking months. Do you remember when I zoomed in on the sunflowers
[1525.50s -> 1532.23s]  and there was a little picture of Otto? She drew that. She also took all those sunflower pictures.
[1535.14s -> 1540.02s]  Everybody was saying, and I remember, they were like, wow, these photos look really,
[1540.02s -> 1545.46s]  really awesome. It's almost- did he hire a professional photographer? No, it was just my
[1545.46s -> 1554.23s]  girlfriend. But no, she's awesome. I couldn't be happier. We were just trying to find, like,
[1554.23s -> 1560.07s]  an opportunity to kind of talk about it and not be, like, private about it anymore. But I just did
[1560.07s -> 1566.66s]  that for me, right, and for her. Being private about this stuff was important because you never
[1566.66s -> 1574.44s]  know, right? Like, I never wanted to make somebody, like, content, right? That was a lot- a huge part
[1574.44s -> 1580.07s]  of it until we were comfortable. And if she's comfortable, if she wants to be on streams or
[1580.07s -> 1588.68s]  something, then yeah, sure. Fuck yeah. Hey, that's the reason why you didn't hear about this
[1589.40s -> 1603.93s]  months and months and months ago. Could I be your son? No, I don't- nah. She's not real.
[1605.53s -> 1613.58s]  All right, let's go. No more hamburger helper talk. We're out- we don't have to talk about it
[1613.58s -> 1618.06s]  anymore. We're over that. It's delicious. It's actually a good way to eat the leftovers.
[1619.58s -> 1625.00s]  Trust me, I'm a professional clown. That's a- that's a lie. I don't want to get in trouble
[1625.00s -> 1629.26s]  for saying that. I made that up. I've never been formally trained as a clown. All right, what-
[1629.26s -> 1638.79s]  maybe a good monitor? Should I get a good one? How about this one? This one's 350. All right,
[1638.79s -> 1657.16s]  where's the- where's the basket? Is that too expensive? Should I not buy this? Maybe I
[1657.16s -> 1665.08s]  shouldn't buy it. Get a CRT. Just get the shit out of me. You just saw, like, the mouse tremble.
[1665.08s -> 1674.07s]  Should be dual camel prime. Okay, this is so many anim- why are there so many animals in the game?
[1674.07s -> 1686.17s]  All right, it's an LCD. So how do I, like, start the business? All right, get the computer ready.
[1686.17s -> 1706.15s]  Place the products and get the computer ready. Place the products. Is this it? Computers. Setup
[1706.15s -> 1717.53s]  is not complete. How do I set it up? It's- oh, we need a chair? We're not a cop? Chair. I have to
[1717.53s -> 1726.02s]  use this, like, outdoor plastic chair? Like that. All right, open the cafe. You can do it from the
[1726.02s -> 1737.19s]  main PC. Oh, hell yeah. All right, let's go. Cafe closed. Cafe opened. Wait for the first customer
[1737.19s -> 1749.05s]  to arrive, okay? This guy's been standing here the entire time. I need a chair? I got a chair right
[1749.05s -> 1770.47s]  there. When's your Vtuber debut? I don't know, man. You should punch that person. I'm not punching
[1770.47s -> 1780.97s]  anybody. Do I have to do anything else or just people- oh, all right. Customer sent you a request
[1780.97s -> 1801.75s]  to turn on the computer. Turn it on. On your computer. I was like, wow, it wouldn't even request
[1801.83s -> 1810.98s]  to turn it on. Oh, request. Please unlock, okay? You completed the tutorial. Now you can freely
[1810.98s -> 1813.86s]  play the game if you want. You can take some quests by walking around the city. The game is
[1813.86s -> 1827.50s]  saved when you sleep, okay? What, he's just playing? What the fuck? Oh. Four dollars and five cents.
[1827.50s -> 1835.94s]  Why did you only use the computer for 10 minutes? You could have gone to the fucking library.
[1835.94s -> 1849.66s]  Why did you do that? Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. What do you want?
[1849.66s -> 1858.97s]  Please unlock for two hours. Sure. This is my cafe. If only there was a game that could be played.
[1858.97s -> 1864.47s]  The cafes that open around here are like shit. Wait, that's why he left? Because they don't have
[1864.47s -> 1874.52s]  a game? You can't watch porn? Why are you watching porn? You can't watch that. I thought this was a-
[1874.52s -> 1882.14s]  oh, no, it's not a gaming cafe. Why are you watching porn? Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[1882.14s -> 1897.10s]  You can't watch porn here. Leave. Thank you. 23 dollars? Holy shit. It's still- I don't- I'm
[1897.10s -> 1899.74s]  not watching this. I'm not watching- someone's gonna come and think I'm watching this. How do I turn
[1899.74s -> 1904.26s]  this off? I'm not watching this. I'm- this is not on my stream and I'm not streaming. I'm not playing
[1904.26s -> 1908.58s]  this. Someone's gonna think it's me doing this. How do I turn the computer off? I didn't want to
[1908.58s -> 1913.46s]  comment badly, but what garbage? Yeah, don't watch porn in my cafe. How do I turn that- how do I get
[1913.46s -> 1924.15s]  that off? How do I- okay, thank god somebody cut the electricity. Fuck! What? Why is it permanently
[1924.15s -> 1942.42s]  there? The computer was turned off. How do I get that off? All right, I need to do a quest. It's
[1942.42s -> 1952.52s]  got screen burning. All right, maybe I should do- should I do a quest? What is that here? The screen-
[1952.52s -> 1958.15s]  all right, it's- it can't be there anymore, right? It can't be. Okay, good. It's like rebooting. It's
[1958.15s -> 1976.52s]  all fucked up. God damn it. Will somebody please come in here and get that off the fucking computer
[1976.52s -> 1986.65s]  before I get, like, banned? Please? Why is nobody coming to my- I almost said restroom.
[1986.65s -> 1993.69s]  Somebody come in and use my computer! How do I get- I think that's why- I think I broke the game.
[2003.21s -> 2015.42s]  Mop the computer? This doesn't- this is how a caveman would handle this. I don't know what to do. Oh,
[2015.42s -> 2020.22s]  hi sir, how are you? Come on into the internet cafe. Um, I- this is not my computer.
[2022.15s -> 2026.79s]  Please, uh, go ahead and do whatever you- oh, yep, let me just go ahead and turn that on for you.
[2026.79s -> 2035.74s]  Let me just go ahead and turn that on. Ow! What is going on? Why is it making so much noise?
[2039.66s -> 2043.42s]  He's just sitting there staring at that right now. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[2043.42s -> 2051.90s]  Go back. Thank you. Yes, you're welcome. All right, please do whatever you- but what are you doing?
[2051.90s -> 2060.70s]  What's wrong? Two dollars. What'd you say? What'd you say? There's only a game- all right,
[2060.70s -> 2068.04s]  I need a game. I gotta get- I get a game system or something? I gotta get a game. Computer cases,
[2070.14s -> 2081.40s]  air conditioning, arcade consoles. Yeah, well, I don't have that much money. Uh, PlayStation 1.
[2081.40s -> 2093.56s]  PlayStation 1. I need a TV for it, right? Yeah, I need a good gamer chair. This one here. And then
[2096.17s -> 2107.72s]  a- this one. No, one of these. What's wrong? Okay, uh, I need a monitor. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2107.72s -> 2112.20s]  wait, wait. What's going on? Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What's happening? Oh, go ahead,
[2112.20s -> 2123.67s]  go for it. All right, let me open up my- where's my cart? I need a monitor. Keyboards, monitors,
[2123.67s -> 2131.21s]  there we go. Uh, and all- CRT gets PlayStation 1. All right, bye. All right, new stuff coming in.
[2140.01s -> 2146.55s]  People are talking. I'm the porn place now. Who watches porn like this?
[2146.63s -> 2157.94s]  Nobody watches porn leaning back like that in the chair. I don't know. Yes, thank you for coming.
[2157.94s -> 2180.90s]  They do pay a lot of money, though. All right, what we got? Chair. Okay, console. Spray that guy
[2180.90s -> 2188.60s]  with the fire extinguisher. I'm not spraying anybody with fire extinguisher. Oh, I need a table.
[2188.60s -> 2201.94s]  Shit. Don't touch this. I probably should get more than one controller, right? My frames are
[2201.94s -> 2213.70s]  dropping? They shouldn't be. Frames, frames. What do you mean? My frames are all right. What are you
[2216.58s -> 2228.09s]  on about? It's fine now. I got a 3090. Should I turn the graphics down? Maybe it's just too much.
[2228.09s -> 2231.05s]  Oh, well, I think I'm playing on- yeah, I don't think this game is designed to be played on
[2231.05s -> 2242.94s]  Ultra. Probably better. Oh, what's up? Oh, right. If you'd like to use the computer, let me know.
[2242.94s -> 2251.88s]  Let me accept this request, and then I'm gonna get a- I gotta get a table. 30 minutes, go ahead.
[2251.88s -> 2262.07s]  I didn't know what to say. All right, leave. I want- you gonna pay? Customer runs away without
[2262.07s -> 2273.19s]  paying. You don't really seem to be running. How do I- what do I do? Give me that money back.
[2275.51s -> 2287.80s]  Um, I didn't- just pay me the money! How do I get the money back? All right, I'll just-
[2289.85s -> 2295.38s]  why are we fighting out here? Oh god, I'm getting my ass kicked. Watch out, watch out, watch out,
[2295.38s -> 2302.17s]  watch out, watch out. Can I use this? Oh, shit. Did I get it? Two bucks. All right, somebody help
[2302.17s -> 2314.33s]  her up. Somebody help her. All that for two dollars. It's not worth fighting over. That was
[2314.33s -> 2332.46s]  not worth a fight. It really wasn't. I was gonna die. I need a table. Why does the computer keep
[2332.46s -> 2337.96s]  turning off? Yeah, it's not nice. There are zero games you can play. Lul. So I'm gonna walk out
[2337.96s -> 2351.08s]  without paying. All right, table. Desks. Does that count? This is- you can get VR too? Holy shit,
[2351.08s -> 2359.98s]  I'm invested. Basic console table. Yeah, I'm- I'm running out of money. Oh, shit, I'm actually
[2359.98s -> 2369.40s]  running out of money. Whoever just comes in here- the people that watch porn literally pay the most,
[2369.40s -> 2395.34s]  so I don't even care anymore. Where's my mop? You gotta buy the PC games on- oh, okay. There you go.
[2395.34s -> 2407.22s]  Clean this up. Don't mind me. Don't mind me! Just cleaning up the place, that's all.
[2409.64s -> 2414.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what- that's not
[2414.78s -> 2420.30s]  what I was doing. I know it looked really, really weird right there. I'm not- okay. Yes, I'm gonna-
[2420.30s -> 2430.62s]  I'll take that loss, I will. That's my own fault. Oh, finally. Oh, yep, yep, yep, hold on.
[2433.10s -> 2447.22s]  Thank you. 63 bucks. Whoa! What happened? What? Why did the computer explode? What happened?
[2447.94s -> 2459.62s]  Did the- was it- wait, did that guy overload the computer with porn viruses? It was a bomb. Oh my
[2459.62s -> 2476.46s]  god. Okay, that- that was fucking crazy. Uh, all right. Um, what do I do? Um, wait, wait, wait,
[2476.46s -> 2488.92s]  wait, wait. Is it all broken? Does it still work? Oh, it still works. All right. What? No,
[2488.92s -> 2496.50s]  one of the guy paid me 60 bucks. He fucking blew up the computer. I like that narrative better.
[2496.50s -> 2503.16s]  That's funnier to me than the guy came in and blew it up. All right, uh, let's put this over here.
[2503.16s -> 2525.38s]  Maybe like in the side edge over here. Right here. There. Uh, this is so cramped.
[2528.86s -> 2540.14s]  Squid game. Yeah, I- why can I put this here? Is that not- I can't- I need a TV? How is this
[2540.14s -> 2551.61s]  not a TV? All right, well dual monitor setup over here. Imagine doing a dual monitor with a CRT.
[2551.61s -> 2569.40s]  I can't do that. All right, now I need to get a- how do- can I sell that thing? People actually do
[2569.40s -> 2585.74s]  that. Do they really? All right, I need to get an actual TV. TV. Okay, dude, that's- these are so
[2585.74s -> 2607.46s]  expensive. These are the only TVs I can buy. Um, I'll just wait till I have money. 30 minutes,
[2607.46s -> 2615.26s]  unlock. Get some damn game- oh shit, that's right. Okay, how do I do those? What do I get those from?
[2615.26s -> 2630.98s]  Dude, get a TV. All right, how do I- where do I go? Buy some games. Bill Root Slots, skin case,
[2630.98s -> 2639.85s]  apps, Steam. A platform where you can buy the best quality games. All right, download. A virus scanner.
[2639.85s -> 2659.14s]  I definitely want one of those. I only have 230 bucks. Is it robbery? Wait, what? What? What? What?
[2659.14s -> 2680.34s]  What? Why can't I hurt this guy? Did I get my money back? Try- wait, he tried to pay and I ignored
[2680.34s -> 2699.48s]  him? No, what? That didn't happen, right? Shit. All right, I got Steam- I got Steam installed.
[2699.48s -> 2707.64s]  No, no, not happening. Not happening. That guy didn't pay. That guy definitely didn't pay. Did you
[2707.64s -> 2722.90s]  pay? Why does it say he didn't pay? You didn't turn his PC on. What? He didn't do anything? Why
[2722.90s -> 2736.60s]  was he here for so long? That's horse shit. Don't run in here. All right. Okay, unlock. Steam should
[2736.60s -> 2754.54s]  be on there now, right? Okay, apps. Steam. That's- okay, that's installed now. Steam. 120 rush B
[2754.54s -> 2766.73s]  simulator. Toss a coin simulator. Uh, cyber hotfix. Fat smoke. Speedrun Half-Life 4. Yeah, that one.
[2767.37s -> 2771.42s]  All right, I can't- I have no money. I know for a fact that guy didn't pay, so we're fucking- that
[2771.42s -> 2803.05s]  guy's dead. Oh my god. This is working? You motherfucker. Give me my money! Oh fuck, give me
[2803.05s -> 2817.90s]  that. Give me that back. Give me, give me, give me. Hey, hey! I'll be right with you. Thermometer.
[2817.90s -> 2835.83s]  What? What do I do with this? Spray? Oh, it stinks in here. Okay. Excuse me, sir. I- I- I- just-
[2835.83s -> 2844.89s]  just- basic protocol. Let me just, uh, just hold on for a second. If you need it, uh, if you could
[2844.89s -> 2850.33s]  just lift your arm- underarms up for just a moment, please. Okay. I'm doing it to me too. Doing it to
[2850.33s -> 2864.36s]  me too. Give him access? Fuck, I'm so stupid. Okay, I need to- so I bought a PC game. You're
[2864.36s -> 2872.33s]  wasting it? I don't know, it was- I don't know. This is stressing me out. You're all right.
[2872.33s -> 2877.11s]  Computers are 20 years behind technology. The cafe's not nice. There are zero games. I was
[2877.11s -> 2882.07s]  peeing on my pants. It would be great if there was a toilet. Um, where would I put that?
[2882.07s -> 2893.30s]  Everybody pissed they have pants over there? Who pissed they have pants? Well, I guess I'll take
[2893.30s -> 2901.59s]  care of it. It's one of those squid game guys. Get out of here. All right, all right, we're going.
[2907.06s -> 2935.59s]  Pay me a bunch of money and play a game. What are you doing? 15 bucks? I need way more money than
[2935.59s -> 2948.26s]  that. Let me clean up. All right, I'm not going to mess around anymore. I'm actually going to try to,
[2948.26s -> 2964.90s]  like, win. Change your prices. Oh, I can do that. Okay. Uh, right. Okay, I'll do that. Go do a quest.
[2964.90s -> 2968.34s]  I'm- I don't want to leak. Should I- can I close this place? Oh, I can. All right, I'm going to
[2968.34s -> 2977.66s]  close the cafe. Give me one hour for free. I'll increase the score. I don't know how to do that.
[2977.66s -> 2990.63s]  Uh, okay. Let me- computers. Okay, here we go. Change the price. All right, normal. 1.2. That
[2990.63s -> 2999.35s]  sounds good. All right, now I'm going to close- I'm going to go see if I can do a mission. I'm going
[2999.35s -> 3002.47s]  to take the bat with me though for, like, protection in case somebody tries to kill me or something.
[3003.75s -> 3023.77s]  Can I close it? All right, I'm ready. I need a mission. Go around the city and look for a
[3023.77s -> 3042.18s]  mission. There was that, like, bitcoin guy. I was- map? Secondhand shop? There's the club. Rabbit club.
[3042.18s -> 3051.50s]  100 bucks to go in here? I don't think so. I- these guys scare the shit out of me,
[3051.50s -> 3065.56s]  don't they? What's- oh, this is a store? All right, what's in here? Sells secondhand items.
[3065.56s -> 3078.07s]  Oh, nice. All right. Buy a disc. Buy a bat. Cardboard. VR. Oh, you can buy cheap stuff here.
[3078.07s -> 3087.72s]  PlayStation VR controller. That's kind of cool. All right, kill the store owner. I'm not doing
[3087.72s -> 3095.98s]  that in the first 40 minutes of me playing this game. No. What's this? Oh, this is my house.
[3095.98s -> 3100.39s]  All right, I live here. I was stuck in there for, like, 15 straight minutes.
[3100.39s -> 3111.86s]  BTC miner. I need a quest. Oh, no, it's the same guy just stumbling around. Go to sleep and save
[3111.86s -> 3132.60s]  the game. What's going on in here? What is this? Oh, it's a- it's a streamer cafe?
[3138.44s -> 3146.54s]  Where's Bugleberry? What else is here? Is this, like, uh, apples or a fruit or something?
[3154.90s -> 3158.90s]  Like, this- okay. Should I- I don't want to give this guy 100- oh, I only have 100 dollars left. I
[3158.90s -> 3185.13s]  don't want to give the guy 100 dollars. Get out of my- stop. Squid game. Wait, that is- is that
[3185.13s -> 3194.15s]  XQC? Look at the shirt. What is this shirt he has on? It's him, like, aged, like, 50 years.
[3194.71s -> 3212.97s]  Where's he going? Dude, they, like, they, like, mapped his face. This is crazy. What? Why is Donald
[3212.97s -> 3223.06s]  Trump in this- this game is fucked. Okay. I hope XQC comes to my cafe. Hey, XQC, by the way, just
[3223.06s -> 3233.45s]  let you know. Five star VIP service to come to my cafe. Five star VIP service. In fact, we can get
[3233.45s -> 3241.10s]  a car to pick you up, bring you to the cafe. I'll give you a hot towel. Any game that you want. We
[3241.10s -> 3249.34s]  probably have it in our- on our disposal. I need to save the game. All right. All right, all right,
[3249.34s -> 3263.35s]  all right, all right. This is- we got a shitload of porn. I don't mean- I don't know. All right,
[3263.35s -> 3277.40s]  I gotta save the game. Go home, right? Why am I so invested in this game? Okay. That's crazy.
[3277.40s -> 3298.84s]  It's a mapped- his mapped face. Nice immersive- more immersive than cyberpunk. Why do we not move?
[3298.84s -> 3314.39s]  What is going on? Remember, you're in it too. I am not in this game. I'm definitely not in it.
[3315.03s -> 3349.90s]  What does that do? All right. So now the game is saved. Very cool. I'm not smoking. No, not before
[3349.90s -> 3364.20s]  work. What's on floor two? I haven't even looked. Hey, do you think Jerma is going to read this?
[3365.02s -> 3388.89s]  Absolutely. All right, back to work. All right, I gotta- I gotta get to my cafe. Is this pre-recorded?
[3388.89s -> 3402.22s]  No. Oh, by the way, by the way, I can give you a hard date now, I think. I think I can give you a
[3402.22s -> 3408.90s]  hard date on a big stream. So I said it was going to be somewhere in the end of January, maybe.
[3410.26s -> 3416.36s]  I hope Community Jake does not want to strangle me after saying this, but I believe we can say
[3417.08s -> 3422.18s]  that February 1st, I would be here if you want to see a big stream. I'm not going to tell you what
[3422.18s -> 3432.49s]  it is. Wait, turn the lights on. Is it going to be special guests? Confirmed. It's going to be
[3432.49s -> 3438.15s]  interesting. I- I will tell you right now. I'm not going to say shit. I will keep reminding you,
[3439.14s -> 3445.21s]  but this might be my top three favorite streams I've ever done, without a doubt. Maybe even top
[3445.21s -> 3462.81s]  two. I don't know. It's looking like it could be a really fun time. Am I invited? Of course you're
[3462.81s -> 3473.26s]  invited to watch the stream on February 1st. All right, I gotta open this door. Open. I keep hitting
[3473.26s -> 3485.53s]  escape and I'm stupid. Let's go ahead and open. How am I going to reliably make any money? I have
[3485.53s -> 3500.23s]  $130. When are you going to do the naked ketchup bath stream? That would be so weird. What are you
[3500.23s -> 3514.04s]  talking- Good afternoon. Welcome to EXP and Espresso. Can I get you an espresso? I don't
[3514.04s -> 3519.85s]  have that yet. We will though. It's part of the plan. Limitless. This guy's going to be here all
[3519.85s -> 3539.91s]  day. Oh, hell yeah. It's clean. How does it smell in here? It smells pretty good. I thought
[3539.91s -> 3548.34s]  something was riding on top of the dog. This guy wants to be in here all day. That's good on me.
[3548.34s -> 3564.46s]  Should I pay the guy $100 just to get another quest or something? Back to the back of the guy's
[3564.46s -> 3571.11s]  head. All right, I'm just going to do it. Here. Drop by me from time to time. We seem to get along
[3571.11s -> 3584.26s]  well with you. Now you can buy BTC Miner if you want. I only have $30. Excuse me? Oh, sorry.
[3604.17s -> 3616.07s]  He's been here for a long time. I hope this guy gives me like $200. Can I do anything else here?
[3616.07s -> 3628.26s]  Can I make any money? My cafe. This is all too expensive. All right. Crypto. I- I don't have
[3628.26s -> 3636.36s]  enough money to do any of this. Just buying and selling crypto. Bills? Thank god I don't have to
[3636.36s -> 3650.07s]  pay any bills. Mail. Swap machine. Oh, no. Nope. Not- Holy shit, that's there. Okay, I know that's
[3650.07s -> 3667.50s]  there. Skin case. Oh, man. Clothes. No. Warcry coin? You own zero Warcry coin. 100 Warcry coin
[3667.50s -> 3674.06s]  is $10. Convert the coins you earn in Warcry into real money. You better not fucking leave without
[3674.06s -> 3691.62s]  paying. He was in here for like six hours. It was 100 bucks. Got it. Wait, how do I play? How do I
[3691.62s -> 3702.36s]  play? What's Warcry? Game I can play? All right, what's crack? Welcome to crack world. New IP.
[3702.36s -> 3708.50s]  Example. Join server. Security IP address is constantly changing. Okay. I don't get it.
[3713.59s -> 3734.14s]  Don't turn my electricity off. Do a command. What am I supposed to do with that? Crack world.
[3734.14s -> 3745.21s]  Welcome to crack world. What am I supposed to do with this though? That's kawaii. Play claw machine.
[3745.21s -> 3752.89s]  Can I- Is this where I get the coin things? Oh, my god. This game was literally- This game was
[3752.89s -> 3769.03s]  literally made for me to play it. Look at all those. You won six coins, right? It's 12 dollars
[3769.03s -> 3785.99s]  every time I do this? I got a diamond though. What's that worth? What's a diamond worth? Okay,
[3785.99s -> 3795.29s]  so now what do I do? Sell coins. Sell the- Whoa! Are you kidding me? Holy shit, that's awesome. All
[3795.29s -> 3800.62s]  right, I'm gonna do this for like an hour. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I got it, I got
[3800.62s -> 3818.66s]  it, I got it. Minimize, minimize. Uh, I know, I know, I know. Jesus, get over there. What a shitty
[3818.66s -> 3841.02s]  place. What was the ding? Can you extend my time? Yeah, sure. Oh, my goodness. Extend me? You- Why
[3841.02s -> 3852.18s]  didn't you stay? All right, I'm going back in there and I'm doing that claw game again. All right,
[3852.18s -> 3866.60s]  let's go. Games. Coin drop. Definitely this one. 25 bucks to drop a coin. Five- Oh, yep. That's five
[3866.60s -> 3878.68s]  purple diamonds. Get it again. Back to back. That's- I'll take it. Do it again. Right in the middle.
[3881.05s -> 3898.47s]  I'll take it. One more, that's it. And I'm gonna cash out. Oh, fuck yeah. Nice. Hell yeah. It was
[3898.47s -> 3906.60s]  not as much as I thought it was gonna be. Let me check- I want to just check the other ones.
[3906.60s -> 3919.05s]  The other ones look kind of cool. Okay, they have games. Hit reward? What do you want? Yes, you can
[3919.05s -> 3929.08s]  say as long as you want, as long as you pay. I don't care. All right, slot- Hit reward. What's this
[3929.08s -> 3942.60s]  one? Row? 40 dollars to throw this knife. What'd I get? Oh, you're looking for the green. All right,
[3942.60s -> 3952.66s]  maybe one more. Shit. All right, one more. That's it. Last one. Did I get it? All right.
[3953.38s -> 3961.93s]  Actually, truly the last one. I got the green. Fuck yeah. Actually, not a joke. Hand to my heart,
[3961.93s -> 3984.01s]  hand to the grave. Done. After this next one. All right, cash out. All right, I literally lost like
[3984.01s -> 3994.26s]  10 dollars. Whatever. That guy leave? No, he's still here. I need to buy a TV for this console.
[3994.26s -> 4001.14s]  I spent some- Whatever. I'm gonna sneeze and I'm gonna try to catch it. I'm sorry.
[4003.11s -> 4012.95s]  I got it. I think I got it. Buy some crypto. I'm not gonna- I don't want to buy crypto.
[4012.95s -> 4019.54s]  I only have 200 dollars. I want to see what other like funny little games I can play.
[4019.54s -> 4045.66s]  Slot machine. 50 bucks? Oh, fuck you. What about the lucky wheel? Wait, 97 bucks. Hell yeah. All
[4045.66s -> 4057.50s]  right. Hold on. I'm making money. I'm fine. No, no, no. It's getting dark. Wait, it's the squid game
[4057.50s -> 4064.41s]  guy. It's the squid game guy right here. I stopped being like, oh, I'm the squid game guy. Relax.
[4064.41s -> 4088.12s]  You're fine. I'm gonna overact. You still have to pay for the time you're here. Where's my eyes?
[4088.12s -> 4095.51s]  Oh, I can look in tighter. Okay. Remember, this place sucks. I just opened it. I'm trying to get
[4095.51s -> 4106.26s]  some money. Once I get to a thousand bucks, I can buy, um, because of the virus. The virus.
[4106.98s -> 4110.73s]  Yeah, maybe it's all the porn you've all been watching. Okay, where's my virus scan?
[4114.62s -> 4128.14s]  Uh, where is it? Let me spin this first. Okay, apps, virus. Where is it? Oh, there it is.
[4128.70s -> 4136.17s]  The number of computers connected to the network, two. Start scan. Phone number of
[4136.17s -> 4147.96s]  46 viruses. This reminds me of when I would be at a grandparent's house and you'd run.
[4148.68s -> 4152.28s]  They'd be like, oh, yeah, you could use my computer. If you need to use a computer at
[4152.28s -> 4157.72s]  a grandparent's. Oh, yeah, the computer's upstairs, sweetheart. Yeah, it works. I've got,
[4157.72s -> 4163.08s]  I've got Microsoft on there. And they don't even ask you to do this, but you just do it because
[4163.08s -> 4167.32s]  you're just going to half because you're curious and half because they don't know what the fuck's
[4167.32s -> 4174.44s]  going on. You just run malware bytes or like Windows Defender on their computer. Yes, because
[4174.44s -> 4179.00s]  it's just the first thing you do. Um, and I remember I did that one time and I think there
[4179.00s -> 4182.92s]  was, I'm not kidding. There was probably like thousands of like adware and shit like that on
[4182.92s -> 4188.71s]  it. And you don't even tell them you're doing it either. That conversation does not even need
[4188.71s -> 4206.57s]  to happen because they would, oh, speaking of like overacting, that was like the ultimate
[4206.57s -> 4217.18s]  overacting. Oh, I got hit by the shell in Mario Kart. If I did voice lines for Mario Kart, like
[4221.18s -> 4230.82s]  I just got hit by a fucking trap thing. Why are they, okay, how do I stop them from happening?
[4230.82s -> 4239.22s]  Why do they keep doing that? Why, like, why are they like coming here and like blowing up the,
[4239.22s -> 4247.18s]  why are they doing this? Please pull on, please apologize to my girlfriend. After you thief
[4247.18s -> 4250.46s]  stream, I told her you'd be playing Everhood on Wednesday and we were very excited, but here we
[4250.46s -> 4259.86s]  are and there's no Everhood. I know. I'm sorry. I lied about it. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm actually sorry.
[4259.86s -> 4264.50s]  I did say I was going to play. I did say I was going to play Everhood. It didn't end up happening.
[4265.06s -> 4270.92s]  Very sorry about that. I kind of had a headache earlier and I feel like that was not the kind of
[4270.92s -> 4279.67s]  game to play with a headache. I will play Everhood. You can be rest assured. At some point I will play
[4279.67s -> 4303.37s]  Everhood. I'm so sorry. I don't, I'm really nervous. I'm so sorry. What was that? We just
[4303.37s -> 4311.51s]  laughed. That was weird. Okay. How much money do I have? How long does it take to do virus shit?
[4313.43s -> 4328.87s]  Did they get it? Or did the explosion screw this up? Did the explosion mess it up? Don't
[4328.87s -> 4343.54s]  even tell me that's what happened. I got 324. Treasure hunt. Get more, no more keys left.
[4343.54s -> 4353.90s]  One key is, okay. So I'm going to buy five keys. What do you think guys? Up right? Good call.
[4354.54s -> 4371.48s]  Right in the middle? Eh guys, come on. Middle left? Center left, yep. Middle right. Oh man,
[4371.48s -> 4381.72s]  these are bad, bad choices. Bottom left. It's okay. All right, what else we got? I didn't do
[4381.72s -> 4401.90s]  lucky wheel. I want to try it. How do I do it? I'll spin 15. All right, do it again. Green is the most
[4401.90s -> 4417.74s]  expensive it seems, right? All right, actually the final one. I'm not doing this ever again.
[4417.74s -> 4428.46s]  All right, that's it. Ash out. We got 177 worth. I just keep ending up with the same amount that
[4428.46s -> 4438.60s]  I came in with. What about this Warcry coin thing? Stop turning the electricity off. Whoever's doing
[4438.60s -> 4452.81s]  that. Is there a reason why no one's coming in? Turn the Warcraft game into real money. Hold on,
[4452.81s -> 4472.18s]  how do I do that? PC's not assembled? Apps. Employee. Data so we can find some employees. Warcry.
[4472.18s -> 4482.98s]  There it is. World's greatest MMO game. Download now and start earning real money. All right,
[4482.98s -> 4499.70s]  that's downloading. Is it really not assembled? Oh, that's why. Okay, that's stupid. Are we clean
[4499.70s -> 4513.24s]  though? I think so. Chair. Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. I got it. I'm going to sell this.
[4513.24s -> 4530.55s]  We're closed for a minute. Secondhand shop right here. Hey, what? You're being searched for what?
[4530.55s -> 4538.18s]  What? What's going on? What's happening? Why am I being searched? You've been fined for not obeying
[4538.18s -> 4545.35s]  police stop warning. What the hell are you talking about? What? I'm walking down the street with
[4545.35s -> 4550.07s]  my computer monitor to sell to the secondhand shop. What do you, what do you mean by that?
[4550.07s -> 4561.59s]  What'd I do? I got something for you. I literally stopped when he said stop.
[4576.12s -> 4585.43s]  Even think about it. All right, do I have enough to buy a monitor? Wait, I can play that game.
[4585.43s -> 4602.97s]  I have a bill due. Please stop penalty. Come on, fuck off. Okay, how do I play it? Warcry classic.
[4602.97s -> 4626.01s]  Start game. What? Interact. What is this? Interact. Sell item. What is this? This is actually,
[4626.01s -> 4639.00s]  you can play this guys at level 12. How am I supposed to kill these? They sound like something.
[4639.00s -> 4652.71s]  What do they sound like? Oh my God. What is it? Heart of darkness. I came from PlayStation one.
[4652.71s -> 4679.74s]  How many coins do I get? This hurts my head looking at this. Can I do another move?
[4679.74s -> 4703.98s]  Has anybody come into this restaurant yet? Okay. Open. I can't open. Open it. Open this. There's
[4703.98s -> 4722.92s]  nothing even in these. This guy's a quest upgrade item. Why? I don't even have any money. The loot
[4722.92s -> 4748.23s]  despawned. What level are these guys? One? Level two. All right. Dude, why is there nothing in these?
[4748.23s -> 4760.86s]  Finally. What is it? Jello? Free game. No complaining. It's a free game. You don't have
[4760.86s -> 4777.83s]  the season pass. This is a health potion. Okay. Are you going to stream the new war crime expansion?
[4777.83s -> 4785.02s]  Um, I'm actually not like that happy with like the direction that the devs have taken it. The amount
[4785.02s -> 4789.26s]  of damage that it used to, they, they did, they changed the scaling on damage. At least that's
[4789.26s -> 4797.37s]  their plan. And I mean, I've been playing this game since like 2013 or something. So it's like
[4797.37s -> 4801.38s]  as somebody that's been playing it for a while, it sucks. Well, I mean, it's probably a good excuse
[4801.38s -> 4807.96s]  for me to stop playing it. This is my, I mean, we're in the stator zone for the new guys watching,
[4807.96s -> 4816.34s]  but this is probably I like 40th or 50th character. That's probably a good idea,
[4816.34s -> 4825.98s]  but try something else. If they end up fixing it though, I'll probably come back. Yeah. The
[4825.98s -> 4831.66s]  change in bags lots too, which is, I mean, I love this dev team and shit, so I don't really want to
[4832.46s -> 4839.59s]  talk that deeply about it and to kind of be overly, I would say not, I don't want to be mean or
[4839.59s -> 4842.95s]  anything, but cause I mean, I, I truly, I love this game and I love the community and everything.
[4844.49s -> 4851.46s]  But I don't know if the new lead director needs to, needs to give more input from the fans and
[4851.46s -> 4872.87s]  stuff, but I'm just not fucking happy with it. I'm going to sell these though. Worst joke taking
[4872.87s -> 4881.21s]  more than five minutes. It's only been 30 seconds. Wrap it up. All right. All right. Wrap it up,
[4881.21s -> 4891.80s]  Jeremy. Wrap it up. All right. All right. Wrap it up. That's felt like two hours. Oh, stop,
[4891.80s -> 4899.11s]  please get out of there. I'm trying to pass the time so I can sell, by the way,
[4899.11s -> 4907.88s]  is anybody even in the fucking store? Why is nobody in here? Has electricity been off? Oh no,
[4907.88s -> 4928.49s]  my progress. I'm sitting here. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Okay. Devs did something right.
[4939.22s -> 4947.78s]  Auto save. Okay. I'm almost, this is actually kind of hard to control. I'll be honest.
[4947.78s -> 4967.27s]  I'll be honest. Open. All right. I'm turning this stuff in. I'm done. Okay. Can I use this to craft
[4967.27s -> 4979.29s]  or something? Upgrade. Belt. No, it just costs coins. Let's sell. Hello. What the fuck? Where's
[4979.29s -> 4982.09s]  the booty bay guards? Where's the booty bay guards? What the fuck is going on here?
[4982.65s -> 5005.86s]  Where are the guards? What the fuck was that? How much do I get? I only have 34 coins. What
[5005.86s -> 5017.85s]  can I do with these? Can I even turn these in? How do I get, like, what do I do? How do I get
[5017.85s -> 5029.93s]  out of this? Oh, okay. So now I go to Warcry coin. It's only ten dollars to convert a hundred of
[5029.93s -> 5038.49s]  those coins. I'm never opening that ever again. 433 bucks. Why is nobody coming into the store?
[5045.70s -> 5053.34s]  It really wasn't open. You guys weren't kidding. It's all right. Whatever. Just gamble instead.
[5053.98s -> 5066.25s]  Yeah, that's not a bad idea. That's not a bad idea. The monitor's not connected yet. It is.
[5069.38s -> 5074.26s]  I know the control is on the ground somewhere. Where is it? Hey, what the hell are you doing?
[5074.26s -> 5091.98s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? Give me that back. What is that? Wait, I heard that
[5091.98s -> 5107.42s]  laugh before. Oh, you idiot. Why? Stupid. Did he take the controller? No, I think it's on the
[5107.42s -> 5126.42s]  ground over there. Get it? Flush. Thank you. Clean this up. I only have room for two things anyways
[5126.42s -> 5133.96s]  in this damn place. Whatever. Did he steal the other monitor? No, I sold it. I got rid of it.
[5135.45s -> 5150.92s]  And the tower. Where is it? There it is. I need it. Please decorate. I don't have any money.
[5150.92s -> 5158.87s]  I'm going to gamble $200. And then whatever happens from that, we'll smush it into decorating.
[5158.87s -> 5177.03s]  I saw that guy's back. No, he's not. All right. I thought I saw him sneaking by.
[5177.03s -> 5183.32s]  Even think about it. All right. He's not here. All right. What do you say we do a little gambling?
[5183.32s -> 5200.82s]  Why not? Do I buy a case? I'm going to buy a best case for $300. All right. Come on.
[5200.82s -> 5206.90s]  Any of these good? I got two knives. Those are two knives. That's worth like $1,000. I just won.
[5206.90s -> 5218.46s]  I just won the game. There's literally two knives in here. What do I do? 160. Wait. Do I sell this?
[5218.46s -> 5224.58s]  What's happening? What do I do? What do I do?
[5239.18s -> 5246.62s]  Excuse me. Hey, what's up, man? How you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. Yeah, I just
[5246.62s -> 5253.02s]  opened up this cafe and I'm good to see you. I've got games for you if you're
[5253.26s -> 5260.30s]  ready to go. You can check out whatever we got on the thing over there. Just take a look.
[5261.62s -> 5264.66s]  I can get you situated. I can get the whole package going right now.
[5266.34s -> 5269.59s]  30 minutes is fine, dude. If you want to stay for like an hour, you can. I don't give a shit.
[5269.59s -> 5283.70s]  You know what I mean? You can just stick around. An hour, two hours, it don't matter. Oh, no.
[5285.70s -> 5297.53s]  Oh, no. I mean, you know, I'm just going to look the other way on this one.
[5297.53s -> 5309.85s]  I'm going to look over here. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get up. I got to get up from the seat.
[5310.65s -> 5314.41s]  Thank you. No, no, no. I'll take the money. I'll take the money, please.
[5314.41s -> 5321.93s]  No way. He's leaving without paying. I was my fault. I'm sorry. I should have actually put
[5321.93s -> 5326.42s]  my hand out and then taken that money from you. You know, let's just call it even. It was really
[5326.42s -> 5330.98s]  great to see you. If you ever want to come back, by all means, we love having content creators come
[5330.98s -> 5336.50s]  over and check out our stuff. And yeah, I mean, we could just say that this was kind of like a
[5336.50s -> 5342.42s]  little collaboration and it was really good to have you. You can tell people about us and maybe
[5342.42s -> 5378.31s]  you come back next time and maybe we have a good time. Okay, we're open. Pet the cat. Okay. Minus
[5378.31s -> 5390.18s]  two. You should have hit him. No, I can't. How do you pet cat? I mean, this, I know like it's like,
[5390.18s -> 5400.55s]  oh, he's going to left click. I'm not, I'm not going to punch this cat. Oh, check his review.
[5400.55s -> 5412.23s]  Yeah. What did he say? Let's see. If more beautiful girls come, I'll increase the score. He gave me
[5412.23s -> 5422.34s]  five stars. That's pretty good. I think that's not, that's not bad. Wait, does he, is that implying
[5422.34s -> 5447.98s]  that if there was more porn, if I had more porn? Oh man. I need to get to downloading. I can,
[5447.98s -> 5459.77s]  how do I uninstall this? All right. So now 290, wait, right. So how do I get, I have like all these
[5459.77s -> 5473.42s]  skins and shit. I have a knife. Can I sell these? Do I have an inventory or something? I only got
[5473.42s -> 5486.81s]  one. This is it. Where is it? Wait, what? You only, it only gives you the one. How do I sell it? I
[5486.81s -> 5504.60s]  already got the money for it. No way. Oh shit. All right. Come on. All right. I just got fucking
[5504.60s -> 5528.74s]  absolutely annihilated. All right. I'm done. I'm done. That's it. No more. Oh, what's he playing?
[5528.74s -> 5543.32s]  He's playing half life. He wants more time. You got it. He's playing a game. So this is going to
[5543.32s -> 5550.94s]  be worth more money. All right. What's this whole, I actually have to stop messing around. I keep
[5550.94s -> 5567.18s]  just blowing my money and gambling in an arcade machine. They generate a ton of money. All right.
[5567.18s -> 5574.74s]  Actually no more gambling. I don't want to do that anymore. That's stupid. What about food? Ending
[5574.74s -> 5581.46s]  machine. This game's kind of cool. I need to restart. I don't think so. I have 440 bucks.
[5585.74s -> 5588.94s]  I screwed up because I bought a bunch of console stuff and I thought I could just put a TV on it
[5588.94s -> 5601.08s]  or a monitor. There's actually a lot of stuff. I'm very interested. This is, this is a lot of fun.
[5602.30s -> 5611.93s]  Let's cope. It's not, it's not cope. I like the game. I need to wait till he's done.
[5611.93s -> 5623.88s]  So what should I, I have no bills I have to pay. All right. He wants to pay. Let's go. How much
[5623.88s -> 5633.75s]  you, that was an expensive experience. Wasn't it? 79 bucks. It seems fun in a dumb way. It's just,
[5633.75s -> 5647.11s]  it's just, all right. Gamble on the fruit slots. I would have so much more money if we didn't do
[5647.11s -> 5656.01s]  any of that. All right. I'll do it for a minute. I was peeing on my pants. It'd be great if there
[5656.01s -> 5661.61s]  was a toilet. By the way, if more beautiful girls come, I'll increase the score. How do you increase
[5661.61s -> 5676.07s]  the score over five stars? You really kind of don't. Excuse me. Excuse me. No, put that down.
[5676.07s -> 5720.55s]  Excuse me. I only did that because she, are we open? $20 bet for, okay. Spin. $20 bet. What
[5720.55s -> 5738.95s]  am I even looking at here? What are the lines? Buy a free spin for $2,000. What a rip off. I'm
[5738.95s -> 5760.54s]  not going to hit anything at all. Yeah. I got you. Come on. Um, what the hell? All right. What's
[5760.54s -> 5789.18s]  that worth? This thing sucks. What do these do? What? That strawberries right there. How is that
[5789.18s -> 5803.14s]  not a line? How is this not a line? Come on. Come on. All right. That's going to be worth like
[5803.14s -> 5821.61s]  a hundred bucks. That was something. How much was that? What are you doing? Thanks for coming.
[5823.13s -> 5834.28s]  50 bucks. All right. No more gambling. Do a virus scan, please. What time is it right now?
[5834.28s -> 5851.30s]  One. No new customers come after one o'clock. All right. So let's close. Fucking goddamn virus
[5851.30s -> 5865.74s]  scan. Do the claw machine one more time. I need to buy an arcade machine. I don't have, dude,
[5865.74s -> 5871.69s]  I got to tell you up front here. Every time that we get more than $400, I go back to zero.
[5871.69s -> 5891.10s]  I wish it was warmer. Yeah, so do I. It's January though. I buy more of these. I guess I'm just
[5891.10s -> 5902.74s]  going to sit in here all night and play Warcry Classic. Oh right. The virus scan. You can't even
[5902.74s -> 5909.54s]  get past 300 bucks without gambling it away. I promise I am not going to spend a single solitary
[5909.54s -> 5918.58s]  cent until we get to enough money where I can put it on that console table. I'm not going to spend
[5918.58s -> 5926.38s]  another dime. Not one dime. Make a prediction. Go for it. You guys want to bet on that? I will
[5926.38s -> 5931.98s]  not spend another dollar until I have enough to buy a TV for that console. The PlayStation one
[5931.98s -> 5947.08s]  over there on the on the table. Make a prediction. Trust me. I got it. I got this. I feel like this
[5947.08s -> 5955.11s]  would be pretty, um, be pretty trivial in a few hours. All right. It's doing it. Just don't turn
[5955.11s -> 5974.55s]  the electricity off. Clean this place up. A little dirty. I'm not going to spend any money. I promise.
[5989.10s -> 5994.97s]  You can do it. I'm going to tell you guys right now. If you bet against that, you're going to lose.
[5994.97s -> 6005.46s]  If you say no, I will not be able to avoid spending. You're going to lose. The controller
[6005.46s -> 6012.42s]  is still on the floor. Well, yeah, because I can't really do anything with it now. I need a TV.
[6012.42s -> 6022.92s]  What about if you get fined? No, that does not count. It only counts if I physically spend the
[6022.92s -> 6029.16s]  money. Not something that I have to pay. Like bills or the police fine or something. No. It has
[6029.16s -> 6038.30s]  to be I spend it. Like I go, oh, I'm going to buy this or I'm going to gamble. No, it doesn't count.
[6044.76s -> 6054.74s]  Hundreds of viruses. There we go. Cool. All right. It's a new day. I haven't slept in probably three.
[6055.30s -> 6065.26s]  So let's just relax and go forward, right? Just relax. Shut up. The fuck up. All of you. And let's
[6065.26s -> 6078.49s]  go from here. I'm going to put this in a better place. Like in the corner so I know exactly where
[6078.49s -> 6100.90s]  it is at all times. Let's go. Open the store. Open for business. $92. Come on in. Maybe there's a
[6100.90s -> 6106.57s]  quest or something I can do. Adjust the prices. Should I just make it really expensive and get a
[6106.57s -> 6128.90s]  bunch of bad ratings and who cares? Does that, do I really care that much? 1.3. Hello. Yep, that'll be
[6129.54s -> 6141.72s]  computer number one. I've got you. Is she naked? No. What? What are you talking about? She's
[6141.72s -> 6155.26s]  watching stock footage or the beginning of every YouTuber video you've ever watched in your whole
[6155.26s -> 6161.91s]  life. Anytime any YouTuber has ever gone anywhere in their entire life has been this shot every
[6161.91s -> 6168.24s]  The only thing that's missing is the plane, um, the plane wing out the window.
[6168.24s -> 6174.86s]  The plane wing.
[6174.86s -> 6180.13s]  Have I ever done that?
[6180.13s -> 6185.21s]  Have I ever done the, I'm going on a trip, I'm filming out the plane window?
[6185.21s -> 6186.21s]  Have I ever done that?
[6186.21s -> 6196.47s]  I don't think I have.
[6196.47s -> 6198.35s]  Don't you think it'd be kind of funny?
[6198.35s -> 6206.01s]  What if I made a video, and, hold on, what if I made a video where it was just like me
[6206.01s -> 6210.23s]  introducing that like, hey guys, going on this big trip, it's gonna be so much fun,
[6210.23s -> 6211.39s]  and we'll see ya!
[6211.39s -> 6219.26s]  And it's just like, four minutes of planes taking off and landing out the window.
[6219.26s -> 6227.63s]  It's just like that, I'm going up, out the window, and then it like, it cuts to me like
[6227.63s -> 6234.01s]  holding like a drink on the plane, like, mmm, and looking in the camera, where's the computer
[6234.01s -> 6243.82s]  up?
[6243.82s -> 6248.74s]  You already made this years ago, what?
[6248.74s -> 6253.34s]  Just upload the whole flight, yeah, yeah, it's like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
[6254.34s -> 6261.40s]  Out the window, and then it's just, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and you're just
[6261.40s -> 6267.06s]  sitting there in the seat, just sitting there looking around, it took a six hour, seven
[6267.06s -> 6274.96s]  hour video.
[6274.96s -> 6278.58s]  You're shifting around and just stretching your back, you get up to take like a piss
[6278.58s -> 6280.52s]  and it's just still sitting where the seat is.
[6280.52s -> 6284.29s]  Oh no, don't make it a time lapse.
[6284.29s -> 6288.26s]  Wait, somebody want to, shit, I wasn't paying attention.
[6288.26s -> 6290.36s]  Is he doing that for free?
[6290.36s -> 6302.00s]  I should buy a monitor?
[6302.00s -> 6303.80s]  I'm waiting till I can afford it.
[6303.80s -> 6308.37s]  It's open?
[6308.37s -> 6317.77s]  It's true. Yeah, just have it be the whole flight is the video and then at the very end
[6317.89s -> 6323.70s]  It's just like the point you get off the plane and it gets into like a like, oh, I'm in I'm in the uber
[6323.70s -> 6324.54s]  Oh, here we go
[6324.54s -> 6327.84s]  And it cuts like I'm in the Hoja and you see like in the top right like a battery
[6328.06s -> 6337.58s]  It's like blinking and it just cuts in the video ends. Yep
[6346.80s -> 6358.78s]  Then the next videos you're getting on another plane the dollhouse behind the scenes starts with an airplane window shot
[6359.78s -> 6364.32s]  It does
[6366.36s -> 6391.09s]  Does it actually let me see let's investigate this I want to see now it doesn't
[6396.60s -> 6417.75s]  Where in the very beginning? I don't listen to that. It does. Oh fuck. It actually does. Let me see
[6428.77s -> 6430.77s]  Doesn't right?
[6430.93s -> 6436.56s]  It does hold on
[6440.73s -> 6447.13s]  It doesn't that doesn't count that doesn't count that's a plane landing that's not a plane out the window with the wing
[6447.65s -> 6453.21s]  Going up. It's got the right music though. It has the right music. I will give you that. It's the correct music
[6453.73s -> 6458.01s]  That doesn't count. It's a plane. It's it's a plane going down. It's not like playing going out back to counts
[6458.01s -> 6462.30s]  It does sure. Yeah counts fine. Okay. Oh
[6475.04s -> 6488.94s]  I have not been paying attention at all. Is this person still here? It counts. That's fine. Okay, 214 bucks
[6489.32s -> 6498.52s]  how long till the prediction ends until I either spend money on something I'm not supposed to or
[6499.16s -> 6518.65s]  I buy the thing that I'm supposed to buy. What can I do for you? I changed my desktop background to a quest
[6518.65s -> 6520.41s]  I'm I don't want to just leave
[6520.41s -> 6523.95s]  Look, I did like the Bitcoin quest and the guy was like, hey
[6523.95s -> 6531.08s]  I've got to go to my Bitcoin store and never even went there's the only quest I had another customer
[6534.05s -> 6542.85s]  Thank you. What can I get for desktop wallpapers? Can you actually get them? I want something better
[6542.85s -> 6549.96s]  I'm gonna just click that. All right. Where do I okay bill mail clothes?
[6550.52s -> 6566.00s]  What do I get it was peeing smells disgusting, okay, I'm going home to pee
[6566.88s -> 6570.01s]  Why would you go home?
[6570.01s -> 6579.84s]  Okay, how am I supposed to get a bathroom?
[6588.98s -> 6590.90s]  Well, stop pissing on the ground
[6590.90s -> 6602.25s]  Maybe that would be a easy way to make it doesn't smell in here anymore. You can expand the store
[6602.25s -> 6604.89s]  Let me I need to have more than one person here at a time
[6605.21s -> 6641.76s]  Is there a bunch of viruses on this thing again? There's so many viruses again. It's dirty. It is reduced lots
[6642.18s -> 6647.86s]  No, I need a TV and that's priority number one because once I get a TV I can have double the income
[6648.02s -> 6659.57s]  We're trailing so far behind. I've been here for two hours
[6660.09s -> 6663.68s]  Jeremy your excuse was that you just started but pay me
[6664.52s -> 6686.09s]  No, that's not gonna happen. There's the bat. Yeah, arrest him. What this the guy just stole from me

[6753.66s -> 6762.14s]  What I didn't spend money. I have to pay the fine. I haven't paid the fine yet
[6762.26s -> 6770.56s]  See, I have four days to pay $50 penalty. I'm not paying it
[6770.58s -> 6803.02s]  What's up, you added the stipulation that it didn't count if you had to pay for it. Yeah, that's true
[6803.02s -> 6818.82s]  But I mean, I don't want to spend $50 right now if I don't have to I even go over to the BTC thing

[6887.64s -> 6892.18s]  Silent what do you mean?
[6896.10s -> 6899.76s]  Oh

[7864.55s -> 7872.66s]  Console it's not fair. Did I let him use a computer
[7881.48s -> 7886.08s]  You punch like lightning enemies have a hard time understanding where the punches are coming from
[7887.14s -> 7904.73s]  No harder punches. All right, I think that's good now, please buy TV dude. I'm trying to buy a TV

[8222.79s -> 8243.42s]  I know I know but I can't even hurt him right open the store electricity on scan for viruses
[8250.85s -> 8271.32s]  You play dying light too. Yeah, I would say for sure scan. Yeah, they got a blue screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[8271.32s -> 8277.22s]  I know you play League of Legends. No, I don't want to play League
[8277.22s -> 8287.16s]  I that's the last thing I'd probably ever do I would cover myself in peanut butter
[8287.16s -> 8293.54s]  I'd like a roll around on the ground before I played one game of League of Legends on stream
[8299.39s -> 8314.24s]  Need money
[8314.24s -> 8317.92s]  600 bucks. That's all I need just stay here for a long time
[8317.92s -> 8321.78s]  I don't care what you do your free reign to do whatever you want and go wherever you want
[8321.90s -> 8346.14s]  Whatever I don't care just stay here and pay me money. Okay, still here. Yeah. All right, Dan still scanning
[8346.14s -> 8350.07s]  Just go beat up Vin Diesel. It pays well
[8350.07s -> 8359.38s]  I tried to beat up Vin Diesel, but my back broke across his cement body my bat shattered on him
[8359.38s -> 8387.86s]  Let me get some money here. It's not bad almost there. Just maybe like another three customers and I'm good more tips
[8387.86s -> 8395.13s]  All right, where's am I? Do I have a tip jar? I?
[8404.45s -> 8421.40s]  Can't beat up Vin Diesel with my bare hands. What did I do? Why would he do that?
[8421.44s -> 8454.22s]  All right watching YouTube. All right. I'm if I can is there a block. That's not block. Is that me? Oh, I'm laughing. Oh
[8455.48s -> 8462.09s]  Okay, so now I get it. Never I've been hearing that person laugh. I think I've I've been accidentally pressing it
[8462.13s -> 8477.39s]  It's been me. You're gonna do a live-action family guy roleplay stream. I don't believe so
[8477.39s -> 8498.50s]  No, that's your middle finger button. No, I'd say this is zero chance of that happening. Okay, we're good
[8498.50s -> 8509.10s]  All right, I need please let me know can I actually fight and beat Vin Diesel one on?
[8510.10s -> 8519.83s]  One he killed me in one hit last time. I don't think I'm ready
[8519.83s -> 8533.47s]  I don't know what I keep thinking of like Trump putting the mask on from the mask
[8533.71s -> 8551.34s]  That's all I see the Jim Carrey mask. Oh, so somebody stabbed me
[8551.34s -> 8560.92s]  You can't vote for that for the worst joke of the year. It didn't take five minutes to set up
[8566.00s -> 8568.00s]  P-a-r-t why?
[8568.36s -> 8569.72s]  No
[8569.72s -> 8587.00s]  Believe me because I gotta I'm sorry you can't I you can't vote for worse impression every year if I do a shitty Trump
[8587.00s -> 8597.82s]  I do a bad Trump every year more than once a year. So don't you can't nominate it. It's all it's gonna happen
[8597.82s -> 8626.41s]  It's gonna be bad every year. It's cold in here. You have enough money to gamble now
[8626.41s -> 8634.08s]  I am so close to actually being able to play this game correctly. I'm not going to do that
[8634.08s -> 8656.12s]  There are 20,000 people here. Holy shit. What are y'all doing here? Just vibing. Yeah. All right me too
[8656.28s -> 8661.07s]  All right, close close close close. It's your birthday. Happy birthday. I hope you have a good birthday
[8661.07s -> 8671.20s]  All right. I am so close. How much is the TV?
[8672.52s -> 8694.92s]  $650 I'm almost there for life. I'm here from that reddit video the reddit videos
[8695.04s -> 8705.74s]  So funny like this community has made me more popular without me even doing anything. I didn't even do anything
[8705.74s -> 8731.77s]  I just like my face existed. All right, this would be it right here. The sus guy the serial killer
[8731.77s -> 8738.39s]  They'll look I'm hearing again thing. I have nothing to do with any of these things. None zero
[8738.39s -> 8755.07s]  I find out about them when you do so those who that are coming from some of the stuff that you've seen on reddit
[8755.27s -> 8760.96s]  Amen. Wow, what's this on the front page? It's literally we're at the same time
[8760.96s -> 8765.99s]  You and I are both going like this. Whoa, man. What's this on the front page?
[8766.31s -> 8772.03s]  So I open up my phone you open up your phone. Whoa, man. What's this on the front page?
[8772.31s -> 8775.35s]  We both do the same fucking thing at the same time. I have no idea what they're gonna do
[8775.35s -> 8780.39s]  I don't have no idea what what what we're looking at. I have no idea. I am usually shitting
[8780.39s -> 8798.56s]  I didn't do anything. I'm being stolen from move move. No, I don't fight two people
[8802.84s -> 8813.14s]  No, don't fight three people run. I got my money run that climbers
[8820.41s -> 8825.77s]  Get out of here close the door close the door. I just like sniper bullets to go by me. What was that? What was that?
[8826.37s -> 8829.11s]  What the fuck has happened? I just saw bullets go by me
[8830.76s -> 8833.04s]  How are you walking through a door?
[8834.48s -> 8870.96s]  We're still open. I'm not warming the inside. Why did you hit L on?
[8870.96s -> 8876.36s]  No, he was I he was blocking the way so I'm trying to get around him and jump over the
[8877.28s -> 8893.04s]  Railing you know play Deus Ex probably not any game that is more than
[8893.48s -> 8896.96s]  20 to 30 hours you'll probably never see on this stream
[8897.18s -> 8900.05s]  the only exception is from software games and
[8900.49s -> 8907.04s]  If I get obsessed with something or like a week make me like monster entry or whatever this you'll do it
[8907.04s -> 8916.95s]  This is gonna do it about Dawn of War. Yeah, I mean if we
[8917.47s -> 8922.02s]  Maybe be kind of fun to get a bunch of streamers to just play a huge game of Dawn of War
[8922.02s -> 8931.74s]  I think that'd be funny everybody kind of a basic rundown how the game works and have a gigantic like
[8932.10s -> 8947.36s]  12 person streamer RTS battle the teams all right come pay so I can buy a TV
[8947.86s -> 8954.77s]  Are you gonna stream all of?
[8954.93s -> 8963.13s]  Elden ring yes, I have played every from software game that is released
[8963.53s -> 8969.15s]  In the last six years or so on this stream to completion. I'm going to do it again
[8969.53s -> 8974.98s]  You only stream two days a week though
[8974.98s -> 8981.63s]  I mean when a big release like that comes out that I've been looking forward to I I will play more if I can
[8981.99s -> 8986.39s]  What about the new fable is there a new fable coming up?
[8986.43s -> 8995.77s]  All right, this would put us over the edge. I think yep, all right finally
[8997.83s -> 9007.62s]  $668 it's time to buy the TV. I would like for the mods to pay out
[9007.62s -> 9015.42s]  I did it. I told you not to doubt me, but a lot of you did anyways
[9015.70s -> 9023.58s]  It's the last piece of this puzzle, and then I can start making a bunch of money on the console games
[9024.26s -> 9046.60s]  Diesel's right there. Why can't I just like spin spin spin spin spin spin spin tornado punch right here right in the head?
[9046.68s -> 9068.25s]  I would be able to win. I don't want to steal this nobody take this please say Elon Musk again. I just did yes
[9069.73s -> 9072.94s]  on soul TV
[9072.94s -> 9075.58s]  finally
[9075.58s -> 9095.96s]  Consoles I need a second controller all right. I have $18. It's rain. There's actually weather in the game
[9096.00s -> 9114.68s]  I'm just gonna sell like the thermometer or something what about like breath of the wild or breath of the wild to I've outcome clean
[9114.68s -> 9122.99s]  I know a lot of the older viewers know this but maybe the newer ones don't I don't I'm not I don't really
[9123.84s -> 9131.60s]  I'm not a big Zelda fan. I don't get excited for Zelda the breath of the wild
[9131.60s -> 9137.85s]  I know it's an awesome game, but it's a Zelda game, and I can't go over that hump for some reason
[9137.85s -> 9151.16s]  I never really I was never truly into the Zelda games the last Zelda game that I really played or really cared about was probably
[9151.96s -> 9161.37s]  Probably ocarina of time if I'm honest and then Twilight Princess. I remember playing it and it's just like
[9161.73s -> 9166.92s]  Opening your eyes underwater in a pool, and then getting out and looking at lights
[9167.96s -> 9193.08s]  The Twilight Princess was pool vision for the whole game, and I couldn't play it you didn't pay god. I'm getting headbutt
[9195.92s -> 9197.92s]  $11 man
[9198.60s -> 9216.06s]  Give me another controller controllers. Why are they so expensive?
[9232.99s -> 9235.11s]  What oh my god
[9236.35s -> 9238.78s]  Okay
[9241.40s -> 9253.20s]  Is there some story line that I'm missing here of why the people from squid game keep on throwing just
[9253.28s -> 9262.04s]  Bombing my cafe am I missing a piece of the story here, or is that just hey?
[9262.04s -> 9267.40s]  There's guys that are in squid game outfits that are going to like explode your business. I don't understand
[9267.88s -> 9300.03s]  Why are they doing that? Why why why they in squid game outfits? That's good. How does it smell in here awful?
[9300.07s -> 9311.73s]  Okay, I think we're good electricity back on
[9312.33s -> 9329.76s]  This needs the keyboard back good. Okay perfect. I need that other controller
[9329.76s -> 9341.52s]  I love this dream German really just says buzzwords. I do I just say buzzwords
[9341.64s -> 9366.94s]  What do you mean what buzzwords there's so many viruses on that computer? I need a bat to fine
[9366.94s -> 9376.24s]  I know I pay the fine right here fucking asshole. Why no one pays no one pays
[9376.60s -> 9383.70s]  Has anyone paid in
[9383.86s -> 9404.56s]  Two days Jesus all right this whatever this like tinky-winky guy go up here get on get on get on get on
[9404.80s -> 9447.93s]  Need to get a security guard. I have $30 dude 30 bucks la la clean
[9448.21s -> 9467.03s]  Please pay said you were never gonna say that again. No I didn't I said I'm never gonna say the e word again the temperature
[9468.99s -> 9481.32s]  15 degrees in here 15 degrees Celsius
[9481.32s -> 9490.01s]  That's not that cold is it was that like 50 60 50 45 or something how hot is that yeah?
[9490.05s -> 9508.60s]  That's not even that what how's that cold 59 is cold yeah
[9508.60s -> 9519.85s]  I know we've had the conversation about how hot or cold a room should be right people think I'm crazy
[9520.05s -> 9530.20s]  We're not wanting to be in a house. That's 67 or 68 degrees. I I want my place to be between 72
[9531.28s -> 9536.05s]  73 between like 72 and like 74
[9538.40s -> 9547.04s]  68 is might as well be an icebox. It's a it's a walk-in freezer people turn their
[9547.97s -> 9551.84s]  Thermostats down at night because did you get better sleep or something right?
[9551.84s -> 9557.81s]  Oh, I turn my thermostat down to like 65 at night. I would die in 65. I would be dead
[9557.81s -> 9562.34s]  I would wake up dead. That's too much way too cold
[9565.40s -> 9579.42s]  72 is perfect being in a colder room promotes better sleep. I guess some some study from somebody
[9579.42s -> 9603.34s]  I don't know no not happening 64 is perfect. No don't leave without paying don't leave without even the money
[9603.50s -> 9607.07s]  What why does nobody pay?
[9607.75s -> 9616.82s]  Why does nobody pay I didn't give him access to the computer, then why was he there using it?
[9616.82s -> 9623.94s]  He should have been using it, so he didn't have access to it, but he used it anyways
[9624.02s -> 9648.55s]  So he used it and then just left. I'm getting a bat how much is that?
[9648.55s -> 9667.44s]  I'll take it see it looks like his legs. Oh how much are the controllers 80 bucks all right?
[9667.44s -> 9698.55s]  That's better than buying it 120 all right. Where's Vin Diesel? I'm not messing around now. He broke the bat last time wait
[9698.55s -> 9705.41s]  Will he actually break it have to pay the fine?
[9705.41s -> 9716.22s]  I'm five cents short fine whoever comes here has no self-esteem
[9716.50s -> 9736.37s]  Okay, ooh nice that has a wear meter is that why it broke not because Vin Diesel's like stacked and
[9736.97s -> 9752.14s]  So wait I actually can can get him with it does have a wear meter all right. I'm going for it
[9772.03s -> 9787.16s]  Tell your friends about the consoles that we're about to add if I see Vin Diesel he's getting it there
[9787.16s -> 9810.98s]  He is there. He is he's right there. I don't want to hit four people with this didn't they double team me earlier
[9810.98s -> 9816.87s]  These two oh
[9820.22s -> 9832.98s]  That was so sly very did you hear that where is he yes all right? Do I get money for this?
[9836.23s -> 9851.46s]  200 bucks that's really good. Don't even think about it. I was already left without paying all right
[9851.46s -> 9861.67s]  I'm gonna go buy a controller, and then I can actually use that and that I'm gonna make that expensive
[9861.99s -> 9875.94s]  It's from right here shit. What do I do?
[9876.89s -> 9917.31s]  He's still owe me that he owes me that right he owes me that thing all right nice. Hell. Yeah, thank you finally
[9917.71s -> 9928.52s]  It's only taken two hours to do it do I like coleslaw?
[9928.52s -> 9935.98s]  Yeah, it depends not really the only place I've really ever liked coleslaw from was Canes
[9935.98s -> 9946.81s]  And that's because I like to so after you eat Canes once you've you got like the sauce you got the you know
[9946.81s -> 9949.85s]  Whatever the the fries you get the chicken. That's kind of all over inside of the
[9950.69s -> 9952.87s]  Kind of styrofoam thing whatever
[9953.15s -> 9955.03s]  When it all mixes together
[9955.03s -> 9958.99s]  let's say you take a bite of a sandwich or you eat like a piece and it kind of falls into the
[9959.15s -> 9961.03s]  Kind of well that you have in front of you
[9961.03s -> 9969.22s]  I like to dump the coleslaw in afterwards and I kind of mix it all up and just eat the coleslaw with all like
[9969.22s -> 9977.32s]  The junk that fell out of the sandwich and stuff. That's the only time I really eat it all right
[9977.32s -> 9985.21s]  I have it's it's we're gonna make this two bucks an hour. It's expensive
[9985.57s -> 10006.18s]  We're doing it the bat is ready to go. I'm gonna enjoy some console games. It's fine, too
[10006.18s -> 10022.65s]  That's right. He eats hamburger helper. Why are you all surprised?
[10022.65s -> 10034.28s]  He eats like a starving rodent hamburger helper is good on salt. We don't have to have this conversation again
[10034.64s -> 10063.06s]  There are no games for the console really I mean she's in here, okay nice
[10063.30s -> 10067.36s]  All right, then I'm gonna get an arcade machine to go in the corner
[10067.36s -> 10079.68s]  I wouldn't feed hamburger help which are my greatest enemy. It's why it's so easy. It's such an easy dinner. It feeds it feeds like
[10080.08s -> 10088.00s]  60 people when you make a box all it is is just ground beef and the box. It's really easy to make
[10088.04s -> 10099.87s]  It's really hearty. It's really filling. It's good. I said this in beginning of the stream
[10099.87s -> 10110.20s]  It's gross when you make it, but after it's done, and you take a bite you go. Holy shit
[10110.20s -> 10127.21s]  This is insane. My mom used to feed me hamburger helper all the time pretty sure it's why I have whatever
[10128.99s -> 10130.99s]  Hi, that was 120 bucks right there

[11791.27s -> 11795.57s]  Hundred like ten seconds ago. Why do I have only three fucking dollars?
[11795.57s -> 11807.80s]  How much is Dogecoin gonna hopefully the devs put it like a joke in the game or something where like Dogecoin goes like
[11807.80s -> 11814.62s]  Up like five million percent. I'm just gonna make sure that I always have like a hundred bucks in Doge in this game
[11814.94s -> 11828.03s]  Because they're probably gonna do that only you left. Okay. All right. Did I just break it?
[11828.03s -> 11830.99s]  Why is it this guy kicked me once what?
[11834.76s -> 11855.66s]  Everybody's paying without god. They both just left without use the bat. I just didn't it broke on his head
[11855.74s -> 11864.78s]  All right, if I gamble again, I'm gonna open it we're gonna clean up
[11864.78s -> 11874.50s]  I'm gonna open the store if if I gamble again, I'm gonna turn off the stream
[11874.50s -> 11876.94s]  Okay
[11876.94s -> 11886.48s]  Over the next 30 straight minutes over 30 minutes if I gamble again stream turns off. I am saving money
[11887.00s -> 11903.14s]  No more bullshit. No more gambling. Can we bet on that?
[11903.70s -> 11910.90s]  No, no, you don't have to bet on that. All right, how much is a bouncer?
[11910.90s -> 11926.79s]  I feel like a bouncer is gonna be more money than I'm even making I would have like
[11927.35s -> 11937.19s]  1500 I'd have at least a thousand dollars right now upgrade the punches on the way
[11937.19s -> 11950.43s]  They want extended time extended time the scratch ticket. God watches the stream ends in ten
[11950.43s -> 11962.34s]  It does not end in ten minutes. Don't you go and go up yet?
[11962.34s -> 11967.74s]  No room if you could do a voice for a cartoon what we do
[11967.74s -> 11978.06s]  I'll probably auto feel like Otto would be a fun voice to do for a cartoon. All right, 70 bucks at 80 bucks
[11978.06s -> 11992.58s]  That's really good. You smoke in here. I think I didn't even do anything
[11992.58s -> 11996.74s]  But I knew I mean he was he was creepily walking into the store, right?
[11996.74s -> 12007.18s]  I mean, that's not illegal, but it was up. It was a little odd. I mean that guy whatever, you know what I mean?

[12068.28s -> 12084.76s]  There we go. All right. I'm confident now. I'm good. What what do I need? What do I actually but maybe the
[12085.14s -> 12099.98s]  What are you what can I do for you? What do you want? What do you want? That's weird
[12099.98s -> 12107.91s]  I think it smells in here. Does it? Oh my goodness. It stinks in here. I have no cans empty
[12107.99s -> 12128.67s]  What does it smell like in here? I have to go buy a stink remover. Whatever it is buy some Bitcoin miners
[12128.89s -> 12150.32s]  We go crash into the computer. That's fine. Oops. Oh
[12155.41s -> 12161.85s]  It's cuz it's an old PC. Is that why this thing keeps doing this?
[12161.85s -> 12190.14s]  Give me a second man. The the fucking place is on fire. Okay, feel good. I'm ready sell the empty
[12190.80s -> 12205.49s]  Extinguisher and buy a new one. You're almost out. All right, you know, everybody just go home. Go home. Go go go
[12205.49s -> 12211.57s]  Get out of here. Go home. Take it
[12212.29s -> 12220.90s]  That was up. Oh my god. All right, electricity off everybody out. I'm going to sell the extinguisher
[12220.92s -> 12242.35s]  There's no electricity. So nobody who's gonna even go in there. Nobody cares. What can I sell this for? That's not bad
[12242.51s -> 12250.33s]  Can I buy one how much are they? All right, I definitely want to take it the whole place can't burn down
[12250.33s -> 12278.85s]  That would be awful. What about spray cam? Yeah. Okay. It's time to go to bed. Is the place closed?
[12279.13s -> 12304.76s]  Nobody can even do anything anyways, just close it up. They have a game close this up over here, right?
[12304.76s -> 12326.00s]  Yeah, and I call you know into the stream voice. He hates streaming
[12327.60s -> 12331.29s]  Let me get that out of your head real quick
[12332.17s -> 12344.14s]  Say that's not an end of the stream voice. I just haven't saved the game in like an hour and a half
[12353.64s -> 12395.91s]  Let me out the city getting more populated. I feel like there's more people here now. What what happened? Okay. Okay, they're okay, right, right
[12395.91s -> 12396.91s]  It smells it smells. All right
[12396.91s -> 12405.00s]  Let me buy another can of spray lean the place up and then I'm gonna buy an arcade machine and then we're gonna make a ton
[12405.00s -> 12433.18s]  Of money, I promise 15 bucks. All right, good to go. Oh the empty can leave me alone. Stop. Yeah, I did
[12433.28s -> 12444.19s]  Okay, there's a new quest as well. Um, let me go see what that is. Hey friend
[12444.19s -> 12448.11s]  I heard that electricity is constantly turning off these bastards are deliberately closing
[12448.59s -> 12452.38s]  The electricity to take bribes if you give me 200
[12452.38s -> 12455.34s]  I'll bribe those punks for you and they won't turn off the electricity ever again
[12455.34s -> 12477.48s]  I don't really care at this point takes two seconds to turn it back on. Hey, that's not worth $200 do it for the quest
[12477.48s -> 12488.23s]  I'll do it once I get an arcade machine, which let's take a look. How much are those? It's up by 5%
[12488.75s -> 12508.44s]  Alright, hold on to it arcade machine. That's not expensive. That's it
[12509.68s -> 12517.86s]  325 I got that right now. Alright, I got it. Why not? I'll do it. That's cheap
[12517.86s -> 12533.62s]  All right, where's that empty spray can no more bad reviews and then I'll do the perks
[12533.62s -> 12543.25s]  I've almost took a whole imagine spraying an entire can of Febreze in your house. That would be awful
[12543.25s -> 12551.66s]  It'd be worse than it's smelling bad more customers coming to the cafe
[12551.66s -> 12564.20s]  Let's do that customers are greeted with a pleasant conversation and may ask for extra time or punch two. Yeah
[12565.54s -> 12573.26s]  You're much better at handling the baseball bat because of your background baseball bats can break more easily. I don't know if I want that
[12573.26s -> 12575.67s]  I'll take this though
[12575.67s -> 12606.40s]  Please don't should I put this in the corner? I set a price price for this you will get to that
[12606.40s -> 12613.62s]  I hope how much is that computers?
[12615.67s -> 12627.02s]  Orders computers requests. Where is it? This thing is really janky. Yeah, but how do I just does it just work?
[12627.02s -> 12656.94s]  It's just auto pay. Oh, okay. Cool. Very very nice. That's better. These are sponge ball bubbles
[12656.94s -> 12664.93s]  They kind of look like it don't they I need a new bat too. Yeah, I'm out of bats
[12665.05s -> 12680.41s]  Okay, open 20 bucks should come back pretty quickly. I gotta run get a bat wicked quick wait
[12680.41s -> 12704.58s]  I don't have the money. Never mind. Never mind. Come on in. Yeah, the arcade machines facing the wrong way. What?
[12704.58s -> 12714.04s]  No, it isn't. It just looks like shit. That's why you think that it's $30 to use the arcade machine
[12714.06s -> 12720.18s]  Why did I buy any of this other crap? What was the point of me buying any of this?
[12720.18s -> 12729.93s]  I could have bought just three or four arcade machines and just let them just roll
[12729.93s -> 12739.07s]  It takes two seconds pays better the more expensive the arcade machine is I'm gonna get another one
[12739.07s -> 12750.03s]  Remember is it true that you draw on your eyebrows? Um, I'll neither confirm nor deny that statement
[12750.03s -> 12752.78s]  Oh
[12754.14s -> 12757.59s]  Viruses I'm just gonna pay for the monthly
[12758.31s -> 12771.06s]  Daily virus service thing. Thanks for that. Can I get a I said this earlier, but is there a barrel?
[12771.06s -> 12774.73s]  Can I get a barrel three thoughts on the earth's core?
[12774.73s -> 12781.67s]  We have no idea what it looks like we made up everything that we think is in the earth's core
[12781.67s -> 12798.57s]  Don't all run as one person
[12801.21s -> 12828.17s]  Help help protect your king protect your king protect your king. No, please why I need to hit you with a head
[12828.17s -> 12834.51s]  I can't even fight you though. Even I've got level two fist powers and I can't even do anything about it
[12834.51s -> 12839.56s]  Let me get you. Oh my god that guy's deck. I was about to walk away with a hundred and
[12840.08s -> 12848.46s]  $70 worth of game time that guy slept here overnight. That was a hotel room. Okay, don't leave without paying
[12848.46s -> 12866.93s]  I'm gonna say it once wait, you didn't okay. Good
[12867.37s -> 12880.98s]  300 bucks is an entire upgrade menu that you're ignoring this one here. Don't leave without paying. It's so annoying
[12880.98s -> 12909.27s]  I I clicked request on that guy. No, it's in the apps really employ data so you can find employees
[12909.27s -> 12912.55s]  All right, great program that allows you to use the computer more professionally
[12913.27s -> 12931.70s]  Minor device and then Spotify. All right. Well, we'll do this now that guy didn't pay either not gonna hit you
[12932.22s -> 12944.18s]  Okay, everyone's fucking I don't want to spend I gotta hire a bouncer
[12944.62s -> 12955.14s]  Immediately what? No, don't ignore the people punching me in the face though. Yep. Thanks for the thanks the search
[12955.18s -> 12961.35s]  I appreciate it. Yeah, forget about the people that are attacking me
[12966.81s -> 12977.89s]  Request coming in. How's it? Yes. I know I know I know I know let me guess you're not gonna pay
[12978.45s -> 13007.50s]  Shocker, it's so dirty in here. The arcade pays immediately
[13007.62s -> 13013.61s]  That's why I'm wondering my why do I even have any of these consoles or computers or anything?
[13013.61s -> 13016.37s]  What's the point they get the arcade cabinet?
[13016.37s -> 13022.59s]  It's not gonna get a virus and people aren't gonna walk away without paying they have to already have paid
[13022.59s -> 13037.74s]  I just sell them and just line the wall with cabinets. I'm paying it
[13037.94s -> 13055.77s]  No, you need variety. Okay money will start to actually really roll in here soon. I'll be good
[13055.79s -> 13089.70s]  Where's all this trash that I don't see I don't want to fight you but I will if I have to well
[13089.70s -> 13099.57s]  I don't like I might I don't know what that guy was doing. You're not gonna walk away with $77
[13099.57s -> 13105.10s]  I'm sorry, just max out the prices one people just leave. All right
[13107.98s -> 13113.42s]  625 dolls. I've got some new apps
[13114.53s -> 13120.71s]  Employees protect your shop from all kinds of attacks neutralize your enemies with a very fast reaction
[13120.99s -> 13125.81s]  This $300 for a day five day three, what's that mean?
[13125.81s -> 13135.00s]  I feel like I'm reading like the months of the year and stuff like EU. What does this mean? Oh bouncer
[13135.52s -> 13153.05s]  Nightmare thieves and non-paying customers $260 every three days. All right, where is he? Oh nice. All right
[13153.49s -> 13169.04s]  So he beats people up for me. That's awesome. Now. I don't have to worry about it. What else can I do a
[13171.19s -> 13176.69s]  mascot
[13176.69s -> 13191.87s]  Sure, is this stupid? Where's the mascot?
[13198.58s -> 13207.30s]  They are now everybody come on in come on come all and here
[13207.30s -> 13214.92s]  I just paid $200 the quest line is gonna go and my electricity will never turn off that leaves me with a grand total of
[13216.97s -> 13227.99s]  $15. Oh my god. He stole the TV. Oh my god. Get up. Yeah
[13237.86s -> 13242.52s]  Kick was insane. I'm back. I was worth it
[13242.52s -> 13257.41s]  That was definitely worth it without a doubt right to the back of the head to Wow. All right, cool
[13257.49s -> 13270.00s]  This doesn't doesn't seem to be working. How does it smell? It's not good. We're good
[13270.00s -> 13288.30s]  This thing was 600 plus dollars. Yeah, that would be so sad if I didn't see that come on in in the meantime
[13288.54s -> 13290.54s]  What are the other apps? All right, I hired some employees
[13291.06s -> 13303.72s]  It's minor average mining power not be reached. You could not be included in the network average mining power
[13303.72s -> 13322.97s]  I don't have enough power. Hey, I mean the chair probably radiates. I don't think I can clean the chair
[13323.25s -> 13332.78s]  So if they leave it out paying they get a roundhouse kick from that guy in the head. He's worth it
[13351.10s -> 13369.29s]  Request get rid of the panda. Did you pay? I don't think so. Oh, no, no, no. He did the arcade cabinet night
[13369.29s -> 13393.95s]  Yep, I can't clean this. It's just dirty. She gets more games. All right, how much money after I get paid another one or two times
[13394.09s -> 13411.89s]  He's quick too. All right. I like this guy. That's a good idea putting this near the door
[13411.89s -> 13424.61s]  I don't panic every time so if I put it near the door
[13424.61s -> 13435.96s]  Then I will see them play and then they'll leave and I won't freak out about it. I'm into that
[13436.00s -> 13446.73s]  Yeah, cuz see that when I see somebody run out it freaks me out put it over here
[13446.77s -> 13473.73s]  Come on. All right. Is it weird that I'm just gonna start hitting them in the head when I see them with bats
[13473.73s -> 13477.92s]  I they just may come in and do this like what am I supposed to do?
[13477.92s -> 13499.86s]  I need to have a bat just sitting right next to my desk clean up. We're still open
[13499.86s -> 13518.47s]  They're still an arcade machine that works guards will take care of them get this over here. Okay, put the table back
[13518.57s -> 13533.96s]  Maybe she got a new LCD. Although that thing was pretty good when I've got it though. I remember I got a decent one, right?
[13533.96s -> 13583.93s]  Hey, it's keyboard over here. Okay pain in the ass pain in the behind. Sorry. I'm just reading something upgrade the building
[13583.93s -> 13594.19s]  I don't you think I have money to upgrade the building. I have $400 to my name my cafe. Okay a fun place
[13594.19s -> 13597.58s]  That's good, but I have
[13597.90s -> 13605.24s]  $335 and you do no swears for 30 minutes. I could try it's possible
[13605.24s -> 13613.16s]  I could try it my cafe upgrade page new room a kitchen
[13613.64s -> 13619.09s]  Okay for a new room. I need 800 bucks. It's in is
[13619.53s -> 13635.42s]  1,400 that's not that bad actually old speakers. Oh tip box. I'm getting it. We got a lot of customers now
[13635.54s -> 13659.67s]  We good, but if I can't afford it out of the way, okay, I gotta move this
[13659.67s -> 13677.88s]  I can't I actually cannot leave right here is good. Okay right there for the desk in the back
[13678.00s -> 13686.38s]  This feels really weirdly high rotate your disk to aim towards the front
[13686.38s -> 13692.84s]  Oh, I see you mean so move that actually put the desk in a better spot. Okay
[13692.84s -> 13723.89s]  I don't think I can move this desk. I can't this desk is permanently here. It doesn't smell it's it's fine
[13724.15s -> 13734.20s]  It's a little dirty, but it's doesn't good work
[13735.67s -> 13752.48s]  Excellent job that guy would have got away with it to clean it up got
[13754.76s -> 13768.35s]  How much people tip usually is it more than a few dollars no it stinks. It's not dirty. What do you it doesn't oh shit
[13768.35s -> 13796.10s]  Okay, make sure you tip. Thanks. Let's go bingo more money more money more money more money
[13796.34s -> 13822.12s]  More money more money greedy. No, I'm keeping my prices fair. Nobody was saying dude
[13822.12s -> 13827.52s]  Jack your prices up like crazy, but I mean like a very expensive. I want repeat customers
[13827.52s -> 13835.87s]  I want good reviews you're gonna owe about five hundred dollars in a couple minutes
[13835.87s -> 13852.33s]  I am if I have it I couldn't run away, but high prices make people think it's worth more
[13852.41s -> 13868.42s]  That's actually like not is that like a crazy. That's I don't know that's so weird, but I think I've like I'm gonna do it
[13868.42s -> 13877.40s]  I can't change the front. I have to complete the setup first
[13877.40s -> 13885.08s]  Oh, it's cuz somebody's using it right now people buy iPhones. I don't even know why they still have an iPhone every year
[13885.08s -> 13890.00s]  I don't get it. I mean I do but I don't at the same time
[13890.04s -> 13895.16s]  You know I had the same exact theory about the same opinion on
[13896.20s -> 13903.25s]  Like the fact that they turned iPhones into like Madden games. I don't know all these companies just started releasing
[13904.09s -> 13911.26s]  Something every year. That's the same thing like every two years. We have to have this release
[13911.26s -> 13932.42s]  It's like why does the world all following the Madden formula? This is looking good. I'm thinking of buying a another
[13935.76s -> 13936.76s]  mmm
[13936.76s -> 13942.37s]  Did I get another arcade cabinet or should I buy another room? I feel like I don't need another room right now
[13942.41s -> 13947.25s]  I feel like I don't want another room. I won't see more people stealing stuff. I'm gonna stay small for now
[13947.25s -> 13975.37s]  Oh, you're done somebody else run out. You know what really solidified this to my brain
[13976.97s -> 13986.88s]  WWE the wrestling games they turned it into a yearly Madden game and my eyes were opened
[13987.08s -> 13996.76s]  Because that is the exact moment when those games started to becoming dog shit eyes
[13997.44s -> 14011.16s]  Just I was like that came out of the matrix. I was like holy shit very good. No gambling
[14011.20s -> 14017.03s]  I told you I wasn't gonna do it a new one had more time
[14017.45s -> 14026.47s]  Yeah, I I really hope that they learned and you know what I have said nothing nice and nothing good at all about the recent
[14026.47s -> 14031.99s]  WWE games or like what I think about the development of those games. I have said nothing nice
[14031.99s -> 14033.83s]  It's all been bad all of it
[14033.83s -> 14042.16s]  I will be happy if they actually took the couple three years here to make the new one and it's good if it's not good
[14042.40s -> 14046.44s]  If it's just as kind of bad and broken and shitty and backwards as the other ones
[14046.48s -> 14051.78s]  I don't even think I'm going to get it. I don't think I'm gonna you play it
[14051.78s -> 14058.36s]  I don't think I don't think it's gonna happen. It's been over 30 minutes. It has your rightless gamble
[14058.66s -> 14081.08s]  No, I'm kidding. They've been yearly since 2000. No, no, I don't think so. Well, here's the thing a
[14081.56s -> 14084.32s]  Bunch of companies used to make a bunch about these games
[14084.32s -> 14093.24s]  I don't know what happened and this pisses me off too. It was a time back before like 2008 2010
[14093.60s -> 14100.30s]  When more than one fucking company could make a video game based on a license, right? What happened was
[14100.78s -> 14107.54s]  Yeah, there'd be a WWE game or WWF game every year because like there would be three or four companies making these games
[14107.86s -> 14110.46s]  It'd be like three or four different studios making a WWF game
[14110.46s -> 14115.27s]  It would be three or four different football games three or four different baseball games
[14115.27s -> 14120.36s]  And now all these companies just have mega licenses that have lasted for the last 15 plus years
[14120.56s -> 14132.93s]  That they're just the only person that makes the game and nobody else can I was a big baseball
[14133.21s -> 14136.87s]  Fan back in the day baseball game fan
[14136.87s -> 14138.69s]  I remember MVP baseball was awesome
[14138.69s -> 14144.32s]  And then when they got the license taken away and they could never make a game like that ever again
[14144.50s -> 14145.78s]  They just said fuck it
[14145.78s -> 14153.64s]  We're never making a baseball game ever again and their games were so good the MVP baseball games were the best baseball games
[14153.68s -> 14156.16s]  No one comes close. Nobody comes even remote
[14156.16s -> 14162.48s]  No one comes close and they never will and they lost the license because of all the well
[14162.48s -> 14167.96s]  We're gonna get the exclusive baseball license to make a bunch of shitty baseball games in a row. And what's that? That's weird
[14168.28s -> 14173.10s]  It was 2k, right? Because it was it was the 2k baseball franchise because EA
[14173.70s -> 14175.17s]  Go
[14175.17s -> 14182.00s]  Wait a minute. Hold on. There's a fire everybody. Hold on. It was a license war, right? Well, you guys are gonna
[14182.52s -> 14191.11s]  Do the exclusive rights to football? We're gonna do the exclusive rights to baseball. Why is everything on fire yet? Don't sit down
[14191.11s -> 14207.32s]  I'm not done doing this yet. Is this still burning? What's what's burning? Something's still on fire. What is it?
[14207.68s -> 14228.98s]  Did I get it? Okay. Okay. So EA gets the exclusive licensing rights to Madden like forever, right and then 2k goes
[14228.98s -> 14233.78s]  Oh, yeah, we're gonna get exclusive rights to baseball and then make just like five terrible baseball games in a row
[14233.78s -> 14250.81s]  I was so mad when that happened. I was it was it was inconsolable MLB. The show is great though
[14251.45s -> 14254.21s]  Yeah, I know. I know the show is good
[14263.67s -> 14265.43s]  explainer Andy
[14265.43s -> 14290.63s]  That emo I he's laughing at tic-tacs again. I got tic-tacs up in the other monitor
[14290.67s -> 14300.23s]  I'm just laughing about him. Is it dirty? It is. All right
[14300.23s -> 14302.84s]  It's time to expand and turn into an arcade
[14303.12s -> 14327.12s]  Is it arcade time you made a comment about apples yesterday and said you didn't like honey crisp. Um, thank you
[14327.12s -> 14333.43s]  Good work. It's not that I don't like honey crisp. I just I don't I wouldn't buy them at the grocery store
[14333.43s -> 14349.06s]  I can't afford this yet. Um, maybe I'll buy another arcade cabinet. What about
[14350.14s -> 14358.12s]  It's not look so ugly. These are kind of cool. I like this one. Let's do this. Oh
[14360.99s -> 14362.11s]  Nice
[14362.11s -> 14366.77s]  He's about to run
[14366.77s -> 14375.72s]  He's going after somebody. How come you don't just go back to the old WWE game
[14375.72s -> 14381.64s]  So because that's a very specific question. I have a very specific answer. The old WWE games are
[14383.64s -> 14385.28s]  so slow
[14385.28s -> 14392.84s]  So slow it takes sometimes
[14393.40s -> 14400.29s]  10 to 20 30 plus seconds once you have too many layers on a wrestler like a creator wrestler
[14400.69s -> 14407.62s]  To load even moving an inch to the left some asset it was it's on PlayStation 3
[14409.67s -> 14417.05s]  Xbox 360 and all that shit. So it just it's on such old hardware that it just can't do it
[14417.05s -> 14423.88s]  It can't run I could technically do it
[14423.88s -> 14433.99s]  But it's just I thought he's running rabbit of the walls
[14433.99s -> 14438.11s]  I got new paint and now it doesn't look like we're inside of a bad public bathroom
[14438.31s -> 14449.14s]  You're a millionaire hire somebody to make a wrestling game for you. I think you severely
[14449.98s -> 14459.93s]  Underestimate how much it costs to make a 3d video game. No, no, no, no, no sit down sit down sit down
[14460.41s -> 14478.61s]  I'm just sitting on money sitting on my is it god. No, it's not over the console. Oh
[14480.77s -> 14482.77s]  It's okay, sir, I'll take care of that
[14484.05s -> 14507.56s]  Absolutely ridiculous that that happened. There's two free coke two free coupons to our go-kart track. Damn it get a higher somebody
[14507.56s -> 14509.00s]  I don't want to hire too many people
[14509.04s -> 14520.05s]  Or I blow all my money, I'm gonna polar bear fortnight dancing. Well
[14521.69s -> 14523.65s]  Actually is bringing in a lot of people
[14523.65s -> 14539.49s]  Way more people are coming here than were before I'm getting another arcade cabinet one of the nicer ones. What's a good one?
[14543.38s -> 14556.51s]  Defender let's get defender. Yeah, that's a three-star arcade machine. Nice. All right, get a trash can
[14556.51s -> 14558.51s]  Is that the problem? Is that why I've just been?
[14558.75s -> 14574.70s]  Permanently just being just sweep Andy. I broke that guy's neck an hour ago and it's still messed up. Oh, yeah
[14575.10s -> 14600.82s]  Um, hold on right here. Is that actually what happened? It's a gas pay. Thank you. Oh, thanks for the tip
[14600.82s -> 14615.17s]  Let's get a raid. We get a raid. All right. Oh, we did. Thank you sock pens for the raid

[14652.53s -> 14664.67s]  I'll try to pay should I pay when when do these guys actually get paid? When does that happen?
[14665.27s -> 14673.46s]  You read us an analog clock real quick. Yeah, sure 819
[14674.68s -> 14689.73s]  There you go. When you hire them, they only last. Oh, okay. So I already paid for them. Okay, I get it makes sense
[14690.21s -> 14697.17s]  Makes sense. No. No, I was just I was trying to click it right now
[14697.97s -> 14701.78s]  You didn't even need to do that to that guy. Well, we had it was a complete misunderstanding
[14701.78s -> 14714.50s]  I just had to literally just go hey, I'm I'm I've just come here the room stinks the room
[14714.82s -> 14724.93s]  Does smell but alright, I got people working here. I'm just gonna go I'm gonna go buy a smell thingy

[14813.46s -> 14817.62s]  People keep complaining about the heat and stuff
[14818.22s -> 14821.49s]  People said wait, can I get a heater?
[14824.84s -> 14830.00s]  Or how does this work is it the air conditioner help because they like oh, it's so cold in here
[14830.00s -> 14832.00s]  This is doing I don't see a heater

[14848.20s -> 14867.86s]  I don't think there is a trash can. I don't see one. Is it like a service?
[14868.38s -> 14875.82s]  It's the cleaner way a male one of our security is neutralize a thief
[14875.90s -> 14886.71s]  Why are you even he's standing right next to me? All right, so let me buy this first

[14900.31s -> 14907.88s]  600 bucks that's so much. That's only for every three days. No, that's not worth it
[14908.48s -> 14938.02s]  Maybe it is maybe it is. I don't want anybody to steal that. There it is
[14938.14s -> 14945.67s]  Okay, so it doesn't matter where I put this put it like right up here
[14945.67s -> 14958.37s]  Press F to direct to adjust air conditioner temperature should I do auto air temperature adjusted automatically? Yeah
[14958.37s -> 14969.26s]  Okay, that's better back to clean. This is uh, yeah
[14969.78s -> 14980.98s]  And this is empty. I'm gonna throw all the empties over in the corner and everything I can use on the desk
[14981.34s -> 14984.92s]  Why is it so cold in here?
[14984.96s -> 15001.88s]  Didn't I just get this? Well, what are you doing? Oh shit my hitting it
[15001.88s -> 15031.86s]  I need another one of these now and maybe even another PC. This girl has been here for days
[15035.80s -> 15041.28s]  She you're right, she actually has been here for do I mean I can't what is she doing?
[15041.76s -> 15049.86s]  Why is she has just been squaring up for a week what's going on?
[15050.32s -> 15060.45s]  Okay, I was just checking to see if she was squaring me up or if you're squaring up the bouncer. What do you want?
[15060.89s -> 15072.74s]  What's the problem? Need a mascot back? You're right. Hold on. Let me clean right? Let me get cleaned up
[15072.84s -> 15102.58s]  All right, that's clean clean it up. I do it the mascots right here. Stop him. Stop him. Stop this guy. Stop this guy
[15102.94s -> 15109.90s]  No, all right. I'm sorry. There was a criminal in here
[15110.14s -> 15127.62s]  Where's the go you stole the computer out of that underneath the way the guy was sitting? I'm still not gonna buy that
[15127.62s -> 15133.73s]  That's not worth it the floor the floor the floor
[15133.73s -> 15139.50s]  I'll wait that somebody wants to that ask God's bring it in too many people. I can't even do it fire extinguisher wait
[15139.50s -> 15148.70s]  I'm getting overwhelmed. Hold on. I'm getting overwhelmed. Don't overwhelm me
[15148.90s -> 15155.02s]  We're doing research like to the length of your arm from your fingertip to your shoulder. All right
[15156.02s -> 15160.86s]  What how the fuck am I gonna measure that? I don't know one foot like two maybe like three feet
[15161.22s -> 15165.80s]  Said from the my shoulder to my fingertip around on three feet. I have no idea
[15168.81s -> 15170.81s]  Floor right floor floor floor floor. Oh
[15171.86s -> 15181.26s]  Smokey what a fucking idiot. I shouldn't I should have waited at least a second. That looks worse than the other one
[15181.26s -> 15204.38s]  How is that different? This looks worse. I would love to take your money. Well, this one the orangutan
[15205.18s -> 15223.87s]  Guy watching porn. Yeah, the people watch porn in here all the time. There's nothing
[15223.87s -> 15237.45s]  I can't really do much about it if I'm honest. Hey, dude, did you find those arcade machines in the river?
[15237.97s -> 15245.38s]  No, speaking of arcade machines. I'm gonna go for another one
[15245.42s -> 15264.95s]  They're just really really bananas bananas bananas strawberries. Oh
[15267.29s -> 15291.92s]  Yes. All right. We're good. One more beaches bananas strawberries. Okay, I'm done. I got requests get on here
[15291.96s -> 15310.28s]  Check on your doge coin. Good idea. Where is it? All right here crypto. How many do I have?
[15310.38s -> 15329.39s]  How many do I have I wanted to sell five not whatever there's no Oh fire extinguisher. Yeah, I said before eight
[15329.43s -> 15345.76s]  It's 830 right now. I went well past that I got the bouncer
[15346.93s -> 15351.52s]  I thought he was just had enough for her once and for all and was just gonna drop her
[15380.10s -> 15386.17s]  Got McDonald's colors in your shop
[15386.49s -> 15401.13s]  You can't I um speaking of McDonald's what speaking of McDonald's? I've updated my McDonald's order
[15403.40s -> 15408.70s]  One of my mods said he got my old McDonald's order and he said he like a diarrhea
[15408.70s -> 15415.94s]  I was like man, what do you what are you talking about? I think that's a shit
[15415.94s -> 15421.11s]  Yeah, you know, you're eating all the shareables. What are you talking about? Those of you that don't know
[15421.11s -> 15426.43s]  I have a crazy McDonald's order where it's like three sandwiches like nuggets and the whole point is it's a
[15426.71s -> 15432.81s]  Some of those items are to be shared and he said he said he was like diarrhea or something
[15432.81s -> 15433.29s]  So I was like, all right
[15433.29s -> 15440.36s]  let me update the order for you my new McDonald's order that I get almost every time now is
[15441.80s -> 15450.44s]  Two double cheeseburgers ten piece nugget and a powerade and those are not necessarily to be shared. Sometimes they are
[15451.32s -> 15461.25s]  That's a lot of money. He's like dude. I ate that McDonald's order. You were talking about man
[15461.29s -> 15466.63s]  I struggled to get through it. I'm like wait you ate the whole thing by yourself. What about the shareables?
[15467.07s -> 15469.07s]  He's like shareables. What are you talking about?
[15469.07s -> 15488.20s]  No, you I always order it a ten-piece nugget and maybe like an extra burger or so just for anybody that wants it
[15488.20s -> 15490.32s]  Just because I like wouldn't I don't know
[15490.52s -> 15495.82s]  But I know I come if I go to eat and people like happy and like eating and stuff
[15495.82s -> 15496.34s]  It's like, oh, yeah
[15496.34s -> 15501.42s]  I got sake a ten-piece nugget to have anybody have one if you want them because nobody wants to order nuggets
[15501.42s -> 15505.72s]  Right the ten-piece nugget meal and even like a five-piece nugget with a good drink
[15506.12s -> 15513.85s]  Never seems like enough. So I take that away from the person. I make it so they don't have to make that decision. So oh
[15514.53s -> 15523.94s]  Dude, I really would love nuggets. They're up where they're available man. They're just here in my opinion in my
[15525.32s -> 15528.96s]  Experience most people don't want to just have nuggets and fries
[15529.40s -> 15535.76s]  Like a five-piece nugget is an add-on to a lot of people's meals. I'm like, let me take that out of your hands
[15535.76s -> 15554.12s]  I got it much money. Well, hell yeah, I think it's time for another arcade cabinet
[15554.64s -> 15559.90s]  Last arcade cabinet is the final one after this cabinet comes in
[15561.67s -> 15569.89s]  I'm gonna just coast until I can buy the room upgrade. What's the best one here? This one of these is good
[15569.89s -> 15577.27s]  Maybe this one we have to have variety right? I'll get this one and I'll buy another steam game
[15577.47s -> 15597.56s]  If you like this Shrek one, alright, let's coast nice like your portfolio balancing crypto
[15598.04s -> 15612.04s]  Okay, portfolio dogecoin
[15612.88s -> 15615.18s]  Alright, how many do I have 15?
[15615.86s -> 15621.16s]  Sell nice I made four dollars. Actually, I made like 30 cents
[15622.47s -> 15628.23s]  The trash can there's no such thing as a trash can in this game
[15628.63s -> 15638.47s]  This is actually the last thing I can probably do before I upgrade the building. I'm running out of room
[15638.47s -> 15650.70s]  This is straight up 90
[15650.90s -> 15657.65s]  Yeah, this is 90 bucks. I'd say every pretty much every hour
[15658.17s -> 15669.74s]  We got 90 bucks here in the arcade cabinets. The next thing I promise the next thing I do will be
[15670.62s -> 15676.59s]  A cleaning upgrade update the floor. I already did. It's a different floor. Just looks like shit. I'm sorry
[15677.03s -> 15686.61s]  Holy shit. I haven't saved the game in a long time. You're right
[15687.23s -> 15716.50s]  You are right. If it's the same floor, then why did it cost $200 to put down here? Where's the rest of this dirt?
[15717.00s -> 15726.66s]  Don't get scared. He ran off
[15738.90s -> 15759.09s]  Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry that there was a guy that ran in here
[15759.21s -> 15767.94s]  The arcade machine is nice and clean ready for you. Maybe I should get a better PC now. No stick to the plan
[15783.26s -> 15789.81s]  Customers running away without paying is reduced. You may ask for extra time. What else we got?
[15790.27s -> 15793.75s]  You're known around because of your old history and thieves don't come to your shop much
[15797.01s -> 15802.03s]  Stamina, what else we have? Let me see if it's all the way down. I don't really care that much about this
[15802.75s -> 15808.05s]  stamina boxing
[15808.45s -> 15810.13s]  I have the bouncer
[15810.13s -> 15815.92s]  Body what's all the way at least don't suspect you and I had all the physical stuff. I don't really care about
[15818.46s -> 15837.60s]  Put it down put it down put it down put it down. Where's the extinguisher? Hey
[15837.94s -> 15852.58s]  Alright, um, I think I'm just gonna keep doing the cafe stuff. That feels like the best idea this one
[15853.50s -> 15856.36s]  extra time
[15856.36s -> 15869.68s]  Tipbox people leave more money in the tip box. Oh, yeah. Nice. That's good up rushing
[15869.68s -> 15884.65s]  I do need to say alright, so I gotta close close up the shop. Well, I've seen people wishing for a crash
[15885.11s -> 15888.57s]  Yeah, we're officially closed
[15888.57s -> 15901.86s]  Save the game
[15902.22s -> 15904.22s]  It's out of context I
[15905.38s -> 15915.71s]  Can't I don't want to alt-tab right now, but on the auto context where it's something funny. All right, get him
[15915.83s -> 15935.28s]  We're closed. I don't think about it close it up. Now. How do I tell them to go home?
[15935.80s -> 15943.23s]  Really just stay and protect this place. Most people have said your store is the same as it was hours ago
[15943.23s -> 15950.16s]  You're better than this. I I think it's changed pretty drastically. I've got three arcade cabinets
[15950.16s -> 15955.75s]  I'm about to do a second floor or a second. Um, second room. That's the next thing we're doing
[15956.19s -> 15987.82s]  Yeah, yeah, I tried to punch the pan in the face. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah go back and finish the job
[15987.82s -> 15998.28s]  I'm good. Priority is to get a new room. We're gonna have an arcade
[15999.02s -> 16004.38s]  Cabinet room besides the arcade cabinet room is gonna be a console room or like the yeah
[16004.38s -> 16007.29s]  We're gonna set we're gonna split it up. I got a plan. Don't worry
[16007.29s -> 16026.16s]  At least I hope I do you can go to the club now. I can go to the club. You're right
[16026.76s -> 16073.30s]  Is it us? Is it us? There's slot machines in there. Oh nice. I'm to get a second room. Okay. Hmm
[16073.86s -> 16086.27s]  Did I do now I'm gonna do this first. I have enough to buy it. I got 900 bucks my cafe new room
[16086.27s -> 16098.06s]  I officially have a new room. Is it just here? It's just it made them. This is made a little longer
[16102.80s -> 16116.01s]  Well, I guess I'll put these back here. All right, it's we're closed these two are going in the back
[16116.09s -> 16127.76s]  That's the easiest way to do it. Hey, they should be able to fit back to back, right?
[16127.80s -> 16150.04s]  I'm gonna put this up here right in the middle auto adjust. Please get a new chair. Yeah, I have this
[16150.04s -> 16155.01s]  I do have this plastic lawn chair. You're right. I'll do that in a second, too
[16155.01s -> 16181.88s]  I'll take you that's much better that wait. Is that the wrong way?
[16181.88s -> 16184.89s]  It's a huge improvement
[16184.89s -> 16188.29s]  It really is but just I took me so long to be able to comfortably pay $800
[16188.29s -> 16193.54s]  And maybe some if you if you're new to the channel
[16195.10s -> 16198.06s]  one of the things you have to kind of keep in mind is if
[16198.70s -> 16205.30s]  If it takes an hour to do something in a game, you need to add in brackets like two hours
[16205.38s -> 16211.34s]  So it takes three hours. I get to do I get so distracted
[16211.46s -> 16217.06s]  I'm like the most distractible person probably in the world
[16221.90s -> 16223.90s]  let's get another chair and
[16223.94s -> 16234.45s]  Get two more chairs. So we'll all let's have these with those. That's I got enough money, right? I think no
[16234.45s -> 16248.04s]  I don't I don't have any money. Let's do it later bombs
[16248.20s -> 16272.18s]  Am I ever gonna see a return on this ever? That's a huge improvement though. It really is. Wait, what'd you say?
[16273.65s -> 16278.31s]  XQC spent two full hours gambling until he had zero without ever setting up his cafe, and then he quit the game
[16278.31s -> 16286.29s]  Oh
[16287.96s -> 16291.60s]  My streamer
[16292.00s -> 16322.16s]  Alright, let's go clean up. I gotta buy a different mouse. This just looks like a bar of dirty soap. That's good
[16322.16s -> 16329.74s]  I need a second chair. This is ugly. It needs to be changed. How about just like right here like along this wall
[16329.84s -> 16348.88s]  This gives fun. Oh, what's wrong?
[16356.45s -> 16373.86s]  Why can I put this here far? Yeah, I need a lamp. I mean the light the light the light. Oh, oh
[16375.68s -> 16388.60s]  All right, how come you're creating an arcade in a crack den? I don't know it's fun
[16388.60s -> 16408.63s]  Hey, I think I'm ready to open the place. I have enough we can just coast for a little bit
[16408.63s -> 16422.74s]  I only I don't have any money electricity needs to be it's on right? Yep. All right back in business. Let's go
[16422.78s -> 16436.28s]  This is kind of nice. Look at three or four more arcade cabinets down here upgraded
[16436.28s -> 16442.08s]  Maybe get a kitchen eventually here in the next like half hour. Probably get a new floor. It's clean
[16442.20s -> 16459.56s]  It smells good in here. I think it does this empty. No, it's a more light. So it looks bigger
[16460.00s -> 16469.41s]  What do these other let me see what they look like? I haven't paid my bills in like a month
[16486.81s -> 16498.18s]  Street audio, I don't know. I don't know. What do you mean? We're fine
[16498.18s -> 16503.00s]  We get you have $40 to your name right now, but I have a
[16504.94s -> 16525.38s]  Income stream here. That's about to probably get pretty good. Wait new quest. Do there's a big fight
[16525.38s -> 16548.78s]  Can you bring me three baseball bats? I'm just gonna buy them. Is that okay? Thanks
[16548.94s -> 16558.64s]  Okay, do I have enough to buy three bats because I probably get some money from this. It's forty four eight
[16558.64s -> 16576.04s]  Okay, one more person leaving and I should be good to go. I'm gonna read the reviews. Oh good idea the
[16576.88s -> 16586.41s]  Okay. Oh, what do I want to do here? What was I gonna do? Crash can is in the cafe upgrades
[16586.41s -> 16596.85s]  Is it really kitchen toilet upstairs upstairs? I don't see anything hot dog cart sliding doors speakers
[16597.65s -> 16600.66s]  regular alarm POS device
[16602.38s -> 16613.67s]  He's a shit device. I don't suppose it. Oh, I need to read my reviews. All right, let's read the reviews
[16614.19s -> 16620.04s]  Great place to experience the life of Eskimos. It's so cold. I ran away immediately
[16620.92s -> 16624.36s]  Don't I have it on the auto temperature? Why is it doing that?
[16629.39s -> 16632.51s]  It's so cold in here. It's like the Eskimos
[16633.23s -> 16636.59s]  Except for the times when it's a fire every ten minutes
[16637.11s -> 16640.29s]  Did you just write that review is that you that wrote that
[16641.01s -> 16654.48s]  Isn't this on auto? Oh, what what temperature do you want it?
[16654.92s -> 16687.68s]  Thanks the tip one more time. All right, buy a backpack when you can afford it. You can store items in your bag
[16687.68s -> 16691.10s]  Oh, that's so much better. That's like a hundred thousand times better
[16691.70s -> 16707.49s]  My dog vomited when I turned on your stream. Hopefully, okay into private mission. I know a better place
[16707.49s -> 16712.43s]  There are games of the last quality. However, they don't open computers shit like shit
[16712.83s -> 16722.12s]  I need new PCs or something. I don't know a new computer. How much is a decent PC?
[16726.46s -> 16743.85s]  Computers or are they? Thank you. What about VR chef a VR room? Oh, it's cases, right? Okay fast computer
[16744.37s -> 16752.65s]  About okay. What about this one? This is a decent computer get it. I'll sell the other one right now
[16752.87s -> 16770.78s]  Buy more CS go cases. I was a big fan of this game to be watching. I used to watch this channel
[16770.94s -> 16798.09s]  I really hate to do this to you. But what can I get for this computer under dollars? Wait, I need something else for me
[16798.09s -> 16812.98s]  Don't I do I I've been one of these cool. No, that's way too expensive crazy. Oh, that's right
[16812.98s -> 16836.18s]  Um, where is let's track him down. I need to be here for this because this is a delivery
[16836.18s -> 16851.90s]  I'll just store them in here. Alright, that's much better better computer better reviews. There we go. Alright, you can play better games

[16865.26s -> 16884.21s]  Is this a porn game? I mean the porn stuff is popular
[16884.33s -> 16891.58s]  I'm not gonna deny the I mean look at how many people have come in and just started watching porn if I get a porn game
[16891.58s -> 16909.18s]  I think they're gonna play it a lot. That's so weird. It's not no, it's not weird. It's business. This is business
[16924.40s -> 16935.06s]  Better. All right. Nice. You turn the computer away so we don't just see the porn
[16935.14s -> 16954.86s]  I'll tell you when it's coming just close your eyes. Okay, how much money do I have?
[16954.86s -> 16961.51s]  What is the next cool upgrade we can do I can do a kitchen a bathroom is 1300
[16962.27s -> 16968.55s]  Upstairs is 2400. Probably a kitchen, right? That seems like the logical point of sale is self-checkout
[16969.89s -> 16990.98s]  Mmm, that's not a bad idea floor for the love of God. All right, fine. I'll get a new floor right now floor
[16991.18s -> 17006.73s]  How about this one? This one's blue. This one's nice. But this one this one's very neutral. It's fine. I like this one
[17006.73s -> 17022.38s]  This one's very neutral. I just look so bad. This is not blue
[17022.38s -> 17024.38s]  Oh
[17024.58s -> 17026.81s]  How does it look like this
[17026.81s -> 17043.96s]  How come it's all beat up looking? Do I have to clean it somehow or do I have to what do I have to do?

[17757.01s -> 17772.40s]  Just gamble on fruit slots with a really low bet and just do it a bunch because the bonus can pay a lot
[17775.63s -> 17777.39s]  I have a tuber voice right now

[17790.65s -> 17808.87s]  By gambling upgrades you just did that to 18,000 people not what I'm just saying
[17809.35s -> 17814.62s]  Saying that to me is the equivalent of the manual breathing thing
[17814.62s -> 17830.50s]  I think you guys had it wrong cuz listen I can hear air coming up. I think this is on
[17830.94s -> 17857.86s]  See that's on yeah, it's definitely on. Okay, let's do this now
[17859.13s -> 17875.48s]  400 bucks I do anything else in the meantime. I'm not doing that again. I forget about the chairs. Yeah, I'll get some chairs
[17876.12s -> 17904.22s]  I think I I don't know what this is, but maybe I'll get it back with the thermometer. Yeah, where is the thermometer?
[17904.22s -> 17937.34s]  It's finally on from 15 to 17 Celsius. Finally, you know speaker is how much are they or 90?
[17937.34s -> 17945.92s]  I'll probably get it in a minute. I could do some claw machine as well. Oh this guy
[17946.20s -> 17963.91s]  Can I give it to him one sec? Yeah the fucking way. Where is he there? I hand this in. Yeah, you're right
[17963.91s -> 17976.01s]  I gotta have to be able to carry three. Oh

[18074.06s -> 18091.38s]  I see this one star up there. Can you get more than one star?
[18091.42s -> 18102.17s]  But it did can the can you get like a chase by the police and everything? I keep seeing one star
[18102.17s -> 18114.17s]  All right backpack or 75,000. I don't have that much money. I get this one. All right build
[18116.70s -> 18143.68s]  Am I doing what do I put this? Oh, okay. Very cool. I do anything else in the cafe list probably this one
[18143.68s -> 18160.53s]  I mean, I might as well just buy it. All right, how do I get one more point?
[18160.57s -> 18176.24s]  I just punch somebody didn't get a point. What's the point if you have a bouncer? That's a good. Yeah, that's true
[18184.67s -> 18206.66s]  Exactly. See what's the point? What if what's the very very end of like the cafe list your knowledge of mining equipment is increased
[18206.66s -> 18209.54s]  You can now buy more mining devices and then sometimes in the casino
[18209.54s -> 18219.90s]  You have the possibility of getting back the bet you lost that's actually huge. I'll get this one. I
[18220.70s -> 18237.01s]  Could get extra luck in gambling. Are you serious? I need the point. Yeah, I'll get that's true
[18237.01s -> 18251.25s]  but I just bought the backpack, so what has more priority door or
[18253.45s -> 18260.96s]  Point of sale I'm gonna say point of sale this door really that much more important. I have a
[18261.54s -> 18279.33s]  Bouncer. Yeah point of sale is way more important. The bouncer is just roundhouse kicking people in the fucking head and we're good
[18279.33s -> 18283.02s]  I think we're good. I think we're good
[18283.50s -> 18289.63s]  The only thing I have to worry about is the is the people that run it and just throw like an explosion in here
[18289.73s -> 18297.55s]  Yeah, get the Pete get yeah, I'm getting point of sale. So I cuz I'm so bad and so ADHD about actually
[18298.11s -> 18300.42s]  Taking money from people and stuff. So, oh
[18303.54s -> 18339.50s]  Okay, that's uh, should be good. How do I use this? What can I do this with?
[18340.02s -> 18346.79s]  Fun place. I like cold places. I like it cold even the owner of this place is he open. Yeah, whatever. It's cold
[18346.79s -> 18351.64s]  It's cold. It's cold. It's cold. It's cold. Nothing to do about it. It's for the Bitcoin stuff
[18351.64s -> 18362.62s]  Oh, you see I need the point of sale so bad. He's gonna get kicked in the head and that's not even his fault door idiot
[18363.62s -> 18370.37s]  I'm going to try I have to pick it
[18370.85s -> 18387.91s]  The door is 1200 I'm getting point of sale right now. Where is it insufficient?
[18387.91s -> 18397.16s]  Why that I just had enough I want to say we'll get you more money. Yeah, I keep missing it
[18397.16s -> 18409.51s]  Oh, maybe I will just say for the door. I think
[18410.21s -> 18419.98s]  Door friends I think are out out voting the piece of shit friends. You play Nancy Drew ever again
[18419.98s -> 18430.37s]  No, I can't I'm not gonna say I'm gonna deny ever playing Nancy Drew ever again. Why wouldn't I it's pretty fun
[18430.65s -> 18442.66s]  Would you say is it unreasonable to make my Mayo have a little bit of crunch?
[18443.10s -> 18448.80s]  No, man, whatever people dip their french fries in Mayo. I said it's an English thing, right?
[18449.32s -> 18456.23s]  Almost there almost time for the door
[18459.17s -> 18468.13s]  Nasty really my point of sale. I don't I'm not even collecting people's money
[18468.13s -> 18473.89s]  My point of sale is the bottom of my bouncer's shoe. I feel like that's
[18474.41s -> 18482.00s]  That's kind of fucked up. I feel like crunchy Mayo actually would be kind of good
[18482.40s -> 18494.24s]  Okay, this crunchy peanut butter what if there was crunchy Mayo, how would that even work? Is that disgusting? That's too far
[18494.68s -> 18502.07s]  That's yeah, that's a little gross. You're right. It's eggshells. Oh
[18502.71s -> 18515.44s]  What the fuck you want more time? No, you good. I could go for an egg salad sandwich right now
[18515.96s -> 18522.02s]  I've been like for five hours. I have not even been paying that much attention to that
[18522.62s -> 18536.15s]  Fresh egg salad sandwich is is up there pretty high with everything else spicy mayo is good
[18536.59s -> 18548.19s]  Will you hurry up and get off the computer and see again now she's gonna get kicked
[18557.75s -> 18566.34s]  People's reviews they would start to write this hey make sure you give the guy the counter a little bit more time because
[18567.22s -> 18572.62s]  If you don't if you leave without paying cuz he won't take your money you get your ass kicked outside
[18578.56s -> 18585.21s]  Almost there. I'll have it tomorrow

[18697.45s -> 18699.45s]  That was a cool relatable streamer
[18699.65s -> 18704.96s]  Yeah, I know I know isn't very good
[18705.12s -> 18720.08s]  Complete the bat quest with the backpack can I though I guess I could hold one in my hand and then two
[18720.32s -> 18736.31s]  Wait, let me do that now then. Oh, I can you're right. All right. No, I'm corrected
[18736.31s -> 18766.01s]  You're right one more bat right over here somewhere. Nice. All right, I get money for this
[18766.25s -> 18771.64s]  That'd be great because then I can put the door in immediately and I'm sorry, but I don't have money to give you right now
[18771.64s -> 18775.11s]  But don't worry. I'll make it up dude
[18775.11s -> 18777.79s]  There's an internet cafe owner in the city who doesn't listen to my word
[18778.31s -> 18783.19s]  Everyone in this city listens to my word what I'm asking you to do is place this bugging device under his desk
[18783.31s -> 18786.48s]  It's located on the second floor of the building where you live
[18786.76s -> 18808.03s]  It's the bug behind the rival internet cafe table. Oh wait. It's where I live is a rival internet cafe
[18808.03s -> 18819.12s]  I'm gonna need one of these so this is what this is what the second floor is then okay
[18819.12s -> 18838.35s]  I'm gonna play VR chat together. I want to show you my spongebob avatar
[18838.63s -> 18846.68s]  Um, I don't really I don't really do VR too much one hour for free. Let's see what you are. This is your little
[18850.20s -> 18857.56s]  Nice, would you get those computers from? Hey, those the computers they still use at the bank by the way. Hi, jerma985 here
[18857.56s -> 18872.08s]  I run a different uh operating business down the street. How are you? Did I miss or can I not?
[18875.17s -> 18882.10s]  Smash it up. I don't think I can do oh wait. You got all this over here. Hey
[18884.43s -> 18911.64s]  All right, I bugged it his floor sucks way worse than mine. Why are you guys talking so much shit? Where's that guy?
[18911.76s -> 18945.38s]  There you are 400 bucks. Hell. Yeah, I was worth it. It's time for a door. Let's go you play monster hunter rise
[18945.70s -> 18946.76s]  Nah, I don't think so
[18946.76s -> 18953.79s]  I played a shitload of monster hunter world and finished the game
[18953.79s -> 18958.65s]  I beat the game and I kind of did a little bit of the extra stuff and kind of kept going but
[18958.85s -> 18970.64s]  Mmm, I got my fellow monster monster hunter. It's fun. What's the best iPad game?
[18970.68s -> 18976.25s]  The room series and if you've never played it before let me just you got so much to work with
[18976.45s -> 18981.40s]  They have like five games in the series and they're all so much fun. It's just like a relaxing
[18982.20s -> 18989.30s]  Tinkering puzzle game get the room get the whole series. That's by far the best iPad game
[18989.30s -> 19001.41s]  Just to play in bed for sure. All right door automatic sliding door. It's glorious looking
[19003.84s -> 19028.54s]  Finally nice this fall. I'll do 20 22. What about the Outer Wilds DLC?
[19028.74s -> 19039.20s]  Mmm, probably not. Why would this even light on fire? No one's even using it. Outer Wilds was fun
[19039.64s -> 19043.20s]  But oh no, this is a disaster
[19043.84s -> 19047.22s]  Thank God I had just enough I gotta go now and get another one
[19047.50s -> 19058.28s]  Outer Wilds was a fun game, but the problem with it was I've heard the DLC is really not necessarily confusing but
[19059.55s -> 19067.08s]  Very specific and it could take a lot of time. I probably don't think I'll be into it. That game was really cool
[19067.24s -> 19077.67s]  I just not sure I'd be able to do the DLC very well. It's very cryptic. Yeah, we don't do high functioning brain
[19078.19s -> 19088.34s]  Games on this stream very often. I'm just so distractible. I'm so all over the place. All right, that's another one of these
[19088.86s -> 19101.84s]  Okay, next step is the point of sale and then after that is the kitchen the temperature. Yeah good idea play it off stream
[19101.84s -> 19122.59s]  Yeah, I probably will a little warm money. Oh, right ceiling. I bet I do. I don't have enough money for it
[19123.23s -> 19134.58s]  All right, seems pretty good chair is actually no no chair. You're right. I need a chair
[19134.58s -> 19145.44s]  Is the room both trapped over here? You just opened at 6 p.m. Yeah, it's a night place
[19145.44s -> 19148.76s]  We that's the people that can come hang out and have drinks and shit, man
[19148.76s -> 19166.37s]  Come on in the meantime, I'm definitely gonna play some of these little casino games. All right games, which is my favorite one
[19166.37s -> 19176.91s]  I liked this one. I like the claw machine only turn this shit on first one
[19177.03s -> 19202.01s]  Nobody else at what bias of work in progress. We'll get more soon. Just make sure these people are happy seem to be happy
[19202.01s -> 19220.55s]  Let's go right down the middle. Give me all that shit. Nice right here. Somebody said this one is actually free money
[19220.59s -> 19248.84s]  There's blackjack. Hold on. You know, is there blackjack where this blackjack in the club? What?
[19259.52s -> 19272.58s]  Really? All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna cash this out after today. I'll go play it. All right cash
[19272.58s -> 19282.20s]  So I know you want I gotta get that point of sale man. You're gonna get you're about to get you like your head punched in
[19282.20s -> 19295.24s]  That's so bad. And then whatever who's playing the fucking piano. That's not coming from me
[19295.48s -> 19319.99s]  You need to upgrade the gambling. That's yeah, I'll have it by the time I go to the club. Maybe not
[19320.31s -> 19329.22s]  No, I won't you buy a hookah. Um, that's a good question. I don't know
[19329.74s -> 19364.50s]  500 bucks I want at least 500 bucks for the casino. All right, I caved kind of sounds like a I just keep falling
[19369.15s -> 19388.75s]  Freestyle I have nothing to freeze. I have nothing to rap about I can't it's so stinky in here
[19388.75s -> 19413.17s]  I'll take care of it. All right, wait, think I pay, you know, that's it
[19413.17s -> 19419.00s]  I wish I could buy an automatic air freshener. That'd be great. Should we gonna change songs?
[19419.00s -> 19431.60s]  I know it's kind of reminds me of every song on tik-tok

[20584.10s -> 20597.41s]  Seventeen versus twenty give me a break. I can turn this around

[20670.40s -> 20671.84s]  monetary revenge
[20671.84s -> 20684.08s]  That thousand dollar bet that was a big that was a big bet too
[20685.73s -> 20691.87s]  Anything other than 20 I had 18 if anything other than 21, of course the dealer hits blackjack on that hand
[20692.03s -> 20697.50s]  It didn't happen any other time that sucks. That's so annoying
[20698.46s -> 20720.63s]  Man, it's the Mafia City guy. Yeah, I will be back there with another 500 bucks. It's always a possibility
[20720.63s -> 20721.71s]  That's why you don't go all-in
[20721.71s -> 20725.58s]  Well, you go all-in every single time and you just win three hands and you never play ever again
[20725.78s -> 20741.71s]  Come on in you do a 500 all hand you win 500 bucks
[20741.71s -> 20744.59s]  You do a thousand dollar hand you win a thousand bucks. You do a two thousand dollar hand
[20744.59s -> 20749.96s]  You win four thousand dollars you just and then you get up and fucking leave and then you do and then you start you then
[20749.96s -> 20755.66s]  You go to like those machines that you can do literally one penny for the middle line
[20755.96s -> 20762.52s]  And you just spend those for an hour just drink booze. You just did you sit there for like four hours and do that
[20763.54s -> 20782.62s]  Don't take this advice by the way. No, absolutely do not in fact get don't ever gamble unless it's like unless you just don't give a shit
[20782.62s -> 20791.06s]  Right gambling is always a lose scenario. No matter what even if you win
[20791.14s -> 20797.24s]  It's always a lose scenario gambling is entertainment and if it's treated like anything else
[20797.62s -> 20809.14s]  It's not gonna happen if you are comfortable and you're in a financial position
[20809.70s -> 20812.82s]  To go blow three or four hundred dollars at a casino
[20812.96s -> 20815.54s]  Okay, right
[20815.54s -> 20821.38s]  but if you go to a casino and you take a thousand bucks there or a hundred bucks five hundred bucks and you're like man I
[20821.78s -> 20824.42s]  Can't wait to sit down and make two grand duck. Nope
[20824.70s -> 20831.52s]  Don't ever say that you are gonna lose every single time when you walk in the door
[20831.52s -> 20834.68s]  Pretend that your money just turned into Monopoly money because it doesn't exist anymore
[20835.04s -> 20841.80s]  You bring a certain amount of money into the casino that turns into Monopoly money, and that's it
[20841.96s -> 20851.65s]  This is why I lost ten thousand dollars. I
[20852.65s -> 20855.13s]  Did not lose ten thousand dollars at a casino
[20855.85s -> 20859.29s]  Always put a limit on how much you know, but yeah exactly it can be fun
[20859.77s -> 20861.13s]  Just don't go overboard
[20861.13s -> 20867.52s]  As long as you know exactly what you're willing to kind of play with and just hang out with
[20867.92s -> 20872.77s]  I've had a lot of good times just kind of sitting around a blackjack table
[20872.77s -> 20883.68s]  Just doing you know playing five to ten thousand dollar hands. You know, I mean, I've never done I'm kidding fucking Jesus Christ
[20889.22s -> 20894.02s]  Please don't think that serious. I'm I'm actually kidding. I'm not please
[20897.47s -> 20902.52s]  Stop people sweating. What do you want me to do?
[20903.00s -> 20913.27s]  Yeah, it's the best practice you can do is if you're gonna spend if you're gonna spend
[20914.80s -> 20916.50s]  $100 $50
[20916.50s -> 20923.59s]  Wait, he's be he's trapped. Why is he trapped? He's trying to go after somebody what happened? Why is he trapped?
[20925.66s -> 20933.92s]  What did you just do that to just do this with animal did a cat steal money out of the register?
[20933.92s -> 20947.90s]  What was that also play games out of slow too? You don't want to don't play games that take a second
[20948.34s -> 20959.95s]  roulette's fun because you can do really kind of low bets and roulette takes a while for it to happen and
[20960.59s -> 20973.92s]  Roulette is just throwing coins in the air and like who cares right need more of this
[20979.90s -> 20988.91s]  Blackjack is a bit blackjack is one of the best games with the least house edge and what the house edge means is that's ever
[20988.95s -> 20995.05s]  It's a it's a percentage right and it's based on for every hundred dollars that comes into the casino a certain percentage is
[20995.35s -> 21002.09s]  Guaranteed to go back to the house stuff like blackjack only has I think like less than a 5% house edge
[21002.75s -> 21008.57s]  slot machines have
[21008.93s -> 21013.13s]  Anywhere between like a 10 to 24 percent or so house edge, right?
[21013.13s -> 21019.57s]  So that just means that it's guaranteed that for every hundred dollars or for every dollar that comes in
[21020.29s -> 21026.58s]  24 cents is always gonna be lost at the casino now. That's over time right that's over a long period of time and
[21029.43s -> 21032.83s]  Over a year sure if somebody could hit a million dollar jackpot
[21032.95s -> 21041.29s]  But four million dollars came into the casino right over the course of a day or a week or a month or something
[21044.38s -> 21047.10s]  You're always out to lose is what I'm saying like they're
[21047.70s -> 21058.35s]  The casino likes it when you win because that means you're gonna play more and I'll tell you the itch hits you
[21058.99s -> 21062.09s]  Especially kick that guy in the head the itch hits you
[21062.67s -> 21068.64s]  Especially especially when if you go to a casino and you're with a bunch of friends and you're hanging out
[21068.64s -> 21073.80s]  You're having a good time and you hit on a slot machine or something within the first 10 seconds
[21073.80s -> 21076.84s]  Are you getting there right you walk in? Oh, this is great
[21076.84s -> 21081.96s]  I guess I'll play this one and you've been there for 10 minutes and you hit like a hundred and fifty dollars on the machine
[21085.69s -> 21089.09s]  It's like holy shit, this is fucking amazing. This is awesome. This is so much money, right?
[21091.78s -> 21096.48s]  Are you just gonna leave are you all right? That's it guys
[21096.64s -> 21101.52s]  We plan we plan on having a night out for like at least the next four to six hours. I'm gonna go home
[21101.52s -> 21108.89s]  I'm going back to my hotel room. No people stick around you hang out. You stay you're not just gonna leave
[21109.37s -> 21114.88s]  So you just have to make sure you pace yourself
[21115.40s -> 21117.80s]  Don't go crazy. Don't spend more than you want to lose
[21118.32s -> 21124.53s]  But you're gonna play right as long as that's what you look people go to the casino
[21124.53s -> 21130.76s]  And they don't have any intention of gambling. They just watch their fucking idiot friends lose all their money, right? You can be that guy
[21131.40s -> 21135.68s]  You can walk around with with the beer in your hand or like the glass of wine or the cocktail and just be like oh
[21135.68s -> 21139.64s]  So hey, how you doing? Oh you down 80 bucks. Oh
[21140.64s -> 21144.49s]  This was eight bucks, and I'm just gonna sip it for the next hour

[21156.72s -> 21165.06s]  No, I'm not I want to stop shilling for the casino suits. I'm not shilling for a casino
[21165.06s -> 21174.31s]  I'm telling you how it is. Oh the point of sale exactly

[21339.91s -> 21346.25s]  He said $10 bets a hundred spins. He says okay, all right
[21346.57s -> 21353.04s]  So we're putting up a we put up a ban here a 30-day ban already
[21353.04s -> 21354.96s]  I don't want to be any for that long how about a week

[21359.69s -> 21366.95s]  It's got to be permanent. Oh shit. That's a lot
[21368.98s -> 21375.19s]  Permanent ban did they agree to that I don't know that's like sad though. I don't know if I want to do that
[21375.19s -> 21379.12s]  So I kind of sad so I need a thousand dollars
[21379.48s -> 21388.71s]  You just agreed to a permanent ban if this doesn't work out
[21389.19s -> 21392.51s]  They've been following since
[21392.51s -> 21400.60s]  2019 don't make it permanent. Yeah, okay 30 days. I don't want to do that. Yeah, that's that's that that's too sad to me
[21401.12s -> 21410.47s]  30 days, that's Eve that's kind of sad too. All right one week. No, that's yeah, that's too sad one week
[21411.64s -> 21424.80s]  14. All right. I'll meet you in the middle two weeks. You're gonna get banned from the channel for two weeks
[21424.80s -> 21436.54s]  This doesn't work. He's just that confident though. Just wants to be set free from this place
[21437.86s -> 21445.86s]  Two weeks is like one stream
[21446.46s -> 21453.16s]  That's so funny
[21453.68s -> 21458.84s]  No, I've been streaming two days a week. I've upped it. I'm not just doing once a week anymore
[21459.32s -> 21468.34s]  I'm streaming twice a week now usually like Wednesday and Sunday Wednesday and Sunday Wednesday and Sunday. Come on. Come on
[21468.34s -> 21477.76s]  We're all right. We got to get to a thousand bucks. Oh
[21480.21s -> 21482.17s]  This is important though
[21482.17s -> 21494.28s]  What's the amount of money that they're expecting? I'm gonna make if they win they need to be VIP'd
[21497.70s -> 21504.53s]  Hmm
[21505.29s -> 21510.10s]  Okay
[21510.10s -> 21517.12s]  Hmm. Let me think about that. All right, fine. You get VIP for two weeks if you win
[21517.40s -> 21518.96s]  Well, what's the amount of money?
[21518.96s -> 21525.86s]  We need to have it really clear because if I have to spin a hundred times at ten dollars and you're certain of this
[21526.04s -> 21530.65s]  What what amount because I could just keep going right? So what amount do I have to stop?
[21530.65s -> 21541.44s]  What amount are you expecting me to hit like in profit from a thousand dollars? So I start with a thousand
[21541.64s -> 21552.24s]  Where do I end up with your guarantee with a hundred spins? I want to make sure we get it in chat
[21552.24s -> 21560.30s]  I can't see ten K plus he says that seems
[21561.34s -> 21581.87s]  Thanks. They said ten K plus that's all right. Are you sure? Okay?
[21581.87s -> 21587.79s]  I guess if you're that confident, this is a two-week VIP or a two-week ban
[21587.79s -> 21591.12s]  He's got to get to a thousand bucks. We're almost there
[21591.16s -> 21601.04s]  But wait is it but you have to increase your bet size if you make a decent enough profit
[21601.28s -> 21607.04s]  We wait we this is these enough terms that we're describing here. What do you mean?
[21607.04s -> 21620.53s]  I thought it was a hundred spins at ten dollars a spin if you get ten K per movie IPM seriously
[21620.61s -> 21628.48s]  Say you get to like well, hello
[21628.92s -> 21633.64s]  So you get to like two or three to five K you have to increase my bet to what?
[21633.96s -> 21641.64s]  There's so many terms of this contract. There's so many terms to this agreement
[21641.68s -> 21647.36s]  Okay, so if I hit if I get to like three K
[21647.36s -> 21651.48s]  I then have to I'm I can't just go I need a thousand dollars
[21651.64s -> 21670.54s]  All right, so if I get to three K I up my bet to what twenty or thirty dollars make it three weeks
[21675.78s -> 21686.11s]  Did we did we get any more updated terms, okay, I have to watch XQC play this
[21686.11s -> 21689.25s]  I'm playing this right now. All right, you're here. I'm

[21800.18s -> 21805.05s]  So if I hit 3k if I get to 3k, I'm gonna do $50 spins

[22095.86s -> 22100.34s]  unless
[22101.34s -> 22112.00s]  Just rewind 20 minutes and just watch like the 30-minute rant. I just had about this. I see candy

[22155.12s -> 22158.80s]  Come on
[22158.80s -> 22169.96s]  Respins are well that enough respins don't count a hundred X. What's happened? Oh shit. Okay, uh
[22170.84s -> 22174.09s]  Respins don't count because they're not actually spins. Oh
[22176.41s -> 22187.74s]  We're it what's going on? What are you doing? It actually might happen
[22188.18s -> 22201.32s]  This is not pre-recorded by reading your message pigeon man 42. I just proved it right now
[22201.72s -> 22209.01s]  Not actually spin. No, it has to it has to be 100 actual paid spins. A free spin is a free spin
[22209.01s -> 22220.51s]  It doesn't count. It's part of a bonus. The bonus is its own encompassed thing. It doesn't count candy
[22220.79s -> 22236.19s]  It was a plant. It's so it's getting late too. I probably have to stop soon. All right, there's this free spins
[22236.71s -> 22241.00s]  Looking for a hundred X or I'll take a re-triggering
[22241.52s -> 22255.16s]  Give me another hundred X. It's time to raise the bet. That's I was not told to do that
[22255.68s -> 22258.30s]  There's a hundred X right there. Oh

[22277.85s -> 22292.96s]  Yeah, that know that I it was raised the bet to 50 if I when I got to 3k, that's pretty big
[22294.76s -> 22313.38s]  How do the bombs work? I don't know the bombs in the bonus seem to just be it just the add multiplier
[22313.38s -> 22324.46s]  All right. Come on. It's times one. He's saying to do it now. We've already locked it in
[22324.46s -> 22329.75s]  So I don't know wait he's saying do it now it would hear do we listen to this
[22329.75s -> 22338.98s]  He said he's saying he wants his remaining spins here to be 50. It actually might happen right here
[22338.98s -> 22344.28s]  I got four more free spins times two. Come on
[22350.64s -> 22356.61s]  That's gonna be huge times a hundred. All right. No, he's got it. That's he said 2k originally

[22368.45s -> 22370.63s]  I can't stop it
[22370.63s -> 22373.25s]  Stop auto spinning. How do I turn it off?
[22373.29s -> 22381.91s]  He said 3k, but he also he is saying he wants it to go
[22381.91s -> 22391.60s]  He wants to change it right now because in his original message
[22391.60s -> 22401.10s]  He said when you get to two comma three or five K to put it to fifty stir stir stir
[22401.30s -> 22416.11s]  Stir bean or whatever stir, but what are you in here? What do we got? Yes, they're here. Okay
[22417.88s -> 22423.84s]  Wait, we got a message. I needed to feel it out. You know what I'm saying force and CD. I'm ready for $50
[22425.52s -> 22430.76s]  Okay

[22447.90s -> 22468.12s]  He's gonna get banned. I don't know if there's another bonus with $50 bets. It could be a big deal. We'll see
[22468.28s -> 22475.70s]  I'm gonna hold my breath for a second though because you have to those three candies have to show up this too
[22475.90s -> 22478.72s]  If there's another one, this is a big deal. Oh
[22481.67s -> 22489.20s]  No, nothing is this the among us guy and that's my brother we share a
[22489.84s -> 22495.61s]  Channel and stuff. I think he sucks though. I don't think it's that funny. We have like pretty bad like family problems together
[22495.61s -> 22499.91s]  I think he's a fucking annoying little shit. I mean we do share the channel
[22499.91s -> 22513.74s]  We have like a contract and stuff mom. I mean my brother Jeremy
[22514.66s -> 22526.31s]  My name is Jerba. Our personality is like a little different. You can always tell who's who I'm the funny one

[22529.97s -> 22541.54s]  What a stupid idea. Come on, let's go. This is it. This is his opportunity to make this happen nice, too
[22541.54s -> 22552.31s]  Oh, no right now. He's probably screaming. He wants to see a times 50 or a times 100. Oh, it's going though

[23196.57s -> 23206.55s]  Thanks for playing though, dude. It was fun. We'll see you again. Don't worry. Well, we will reserve your seat for you. I promise
[23210.50s -> 23215.54s]  Hey a stir Ben
[23215.98s -> 23228.51s]  67002 this one's for you. I'm back motherfuckers. He'll it
[23231.59s -> 23233.59s]  Ah
[23240.22s -> 23244.02s]  Music to it pops me up. I was doing it from stir Ben
[23244.54s -> 23254.46s]  These guys are just laughing about me every time I leave
[23256.39s -> 23264.27s]  Where was that last hand I guess the four give me up. You've got to be kidding me. Oh
[23267.21s -> 23270.91s]  Never mind, you got 21 great. Goodbye. Thanks. It was fun
[23271.49s -> 23287.30s]  I'm done. I'll see you guys later. I'm banned too. I'll see you guys on this weekend at some point
[23287.54s -> 23290.04s]  I'm gonna make sure I'll save the game. That's right
[23291.44s -> 23298.48s]  Probably Saturday or Sunday. I will let you know keep your ears to the ground for February 1st. That is the tentative damn holding in a perp
[23301.96s -> 23306.16s]  February 1st is the tentative date for the big stream. It should be a really fun time
[23307.60s -> 23309.60s]  It's something I've never really talked about
[23309.64s -> 23313.90s]  So if you're speculating on what it is, it's not really anything you've heard about
[23313.90s -> 23318.50s]  I don't think I've ever really talked about it. Maybe as a joke in passing
[23318.98s -> 23326.02s]  Well, like one second at some point, I don't think so though. Oh, this is I gotta hold on. Yeah, let me close this place
[23329.04s -> 23337.58s]  Oh, no, it's closer guy. We're already is closed. I think the next stream that I'm gonna do this weekend
[23337.58s -> 23343.48s]  It's either gonna be VR or I don't know. It depends on how I feel. I've been feeling kind of like shit lately
[23343.48s -> 23347.14s]  I've been really headachy and kind of sloppy. So depending on
[23347.86s -> 23354.11s]  All that plays out. It's either gonna be VR or I'll push VR to like middle of January
[23355.91s -> 23362.86s]  They will be streamed this weekend. I'll see you guys soon. Thanks for watching everybody and let me save the game
[23362.98s -> 23372.84s]  It is the middle of January. Well, it's
[23373.48s -> 23383.70s]  January 12th. Yeah, I guess it is but I mean let a few days the plan is so I can do VR
[23384.62s -> 23394.49s]  Before the big stream because the big stream is well, you know, I mean, I don't have to I have to tell you anything
[23394.49s -> 23412.38s]  Right. Give us a hint. No, no, it's zero into a riot. You want a hint?
[23412.38s -> 23418.67s]  Hmm
[23418.67s -> 23426.68s]  No, nope, I don't think so if I want to give you a hint
[23426.68s -> 23432.70s]  It'll be way closer to the event that might be more fun, but not two or three weeks out
[23433.02s -> 23440.40s]  Maybe on the stream before it happens. So thanks everybody for watching. We'll see you soon
[23441.91s -> 23449.88s]  Appreciate it a lot of people here tonight and I was late. I really appreciate it. Thanks for the raids
[23449.88s -> 23453.97s]  It was a couple raids that came in you're still here from those raids. Thanks for watching
[23454.11s -> 23460.88s]  Maybe we'll see you again. Have a beautiful evening. Well, we still have a few more minutes
[23461.04s -> 23483.01s]  Germa TV. Germa TV really is kind of I think that's probably still the most the least used emote
[23483.01s -> 23487.92s]  I think give us a fake hint. I could give you you know
[23487.92s -> 23498.72s]  I could give you three hints right and two of them aren't real. We could play that game. Maybe that might be fun
[23498.72s -> 23517.90s]  I don't know. It depends on how much I want to reveal. Thanks for staying up. This is fun game
[23517.90s -> 23523.20s]  I don't I'm not sure I'll return to it. Maybe I will maybe I won't it was a blast though
[23528.28s -> 23532.67s]  Yeah, aren't they doing this new thing with um, what was the thing?
[23532.67s -> 23540.74s]  I saw about the moments thing or you get a special badge if you were if you at a certain event or something or at
[23540.74s -> 23544.63s]  A certain stream. I feel like that's an awesome thing to have
[23544.63s -> 23548.54s]  I would have loved to have made that for something like dollhouse or something
[23548.54s -> 23557.34s]  At least for like the big event ones if you don't know that twitch is sort of doing like a little test on
[23557.66s -> 23564.66s]  Adding badges a different badge that you can kind of put instead of the other ones that are for specific
[23564.98s -> 23571.36s]  Streams that you were at if the streamer decided to make a special badge for it. That seems kind of interesting
[23571.36s -> 23577.27s]  I think that's way more. I think that's cooler than just simply having like a
[23578.22s -> 23581.16s]  How many bits I've given or how many subs I've given it's like, oh no
[23581.16s -> 23595.44s]  I was like at this stream and it was like fun, right? I think that's cool. It's your friend a happy birthday
[23597.37s -> 23600.98s]  Jayden, I wish your friend a happy birthday whenever it is
[23601.02s -> 23613.26s]  They can also be applied retroactively like you could do 2021's worst stream in best stream. Really? That's cool. All right
[23613.26s -> 23618.19s]  I'm into that imagine representing that has a badge
[23618.83s -> 23621.52s]  the smite stream from last year
[23621.80s -> 23636.34s]  Well, I was there worst dream like the idea 2013 or something that's fine like little t-shirts
[23636.66s -> 23646.31s]  All right guys, I'll see you this weekend. Have a great night. Let me drink some more water. I'm thirsty
[23646.91s -> 23651.90s]  Good night. Take care. Have a great week
