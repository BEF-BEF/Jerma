[21.75s -> 30.50s]  I was not late. I was on time. Yeah. I'm here at the appropriate hour today.
[31.14s -> 42.07s]  You were one minute late. That's all right. All right. What's your favorite word?
[52.23s -> 66.30s]  Uh, truck. I don't know. I don't know about it. I just thought of the first thing I could think of.
[67.40s -> 70.92s]  I don't know. I thought of the first word I could think of. I was just like, okay, I guess
[72.36s -> 90.22s]  whatever. It's pretty fine. Or what are you saying? What did you say? Let me see. What did you say?
[91.02s -> 94.42s]  What should I get a Taco Bell? I'm in the, I'm in the line. Please hurry.
[95.14s -> 99.13s]  Cheesy goody to crunch. That's it. Big two of them. That's it. And maybe a drink.
[99.93s -> 113.94s]  Does he even know he's live? I just clicked the button. I know I'm live. He doesn't have enough
[113.94s -> 124.10s]  fiber. Oh, quantum. Yeah. No, quantum is a good word. Quantum. Quantum just sounds elaborate.
[124.10s -> 127.46s]  It sounds interesting. Something's going on with that word. You know what I mean? It's very
[127.46s -> 137.46s]  interesting. Lots to break down with that word. Quantum. Fulcrum. That's pretty good.
[138.10s -> 149.96s]  Package is a good word. A lot of good words. Anyways, he doesn't even remember saying that.
[149.96s -> 158.62s]  No, I don't. My hard drive is being filled with new information and I'm cleaning out the shit
[159.50s -> 166.65s]  from before. I have a full hard drive. Just wait. Just wait. I want you all to wait until you turn
[166.65s -> 176.76s]  over 35. When you get to be 35 plus, shit just starts getting front filled. You only have a 512
[176.76s -> 187.30s]  kilobyte hard drive? Bro, upgrade. I know. Stir just cleared Q remastered. It's time to pack it up.
[187.30s -> 193.13s]  You know, I talked to Stir about this and I was like, oh yeah, that game Q remastered. Yeah.
[194.33s -> 198.81s]  Like, what a fucking ridiculous, hard fucking game. Like, you played it for like 20 minutes,
[198.81s -> 207.40s]  right? He's, he loves this game and apparently he plays it all the time and he's almost 100%
[207.40s -> 216.62s]  of the whole experience. Really? He's like, yeah, yeah, actually, like I watched you do it and I
[216.62s -> 220.14s]  kind of felt that way too. Just kind of do it and I got to know what the hell was going on and when
[220.14s -> 227.59s]  I finally got it, it became like, like it was an amazing experience. Like, wow. I was like,
[227.59s -> 243.56s]  Stir's got a pretty high IQ. Caveman brain versus genius brain. Which one is which though?
[246.41s -> 272.71s]  Which one is which? Genius caveman. Dude, you've got a rat brain. Yeah, whatever.
[273.67s -> 284.31s]  All right. I, my brain is very good at very specific things, but I think we're all like that.
[284.31s -> 287.51s]  Aren't, aren't you good at a few things that you can really go like, you know, I'm really good at
[287.51s -> 292.47s]  this. I'm not really good at these things too though. You can't be good at everything and you're
[292.47s -> 301.40s]  not bad at everything either. Get it? You can't be good at everything, but you're not bad at
[301.40s -> 313.46s]  everything either. Write it down. That's a quote. I made that quote. Write it down and you attribute
[313.46s -> 327.08s]  that to me when you say that. Is that fair? I wrote it down. I wrote it down. That's not how
[327.08s -> 337.82s]  quotes work. All right. We're going to play Katamari. I didn't even know this came out last week. I was
[337.82s -> 348.12s]  unaware. Uh, we love Katamari. The remake came out, played the first remake. Obviously, I love
[348.12s -> 354.60s]  this franchise. I think this is a great franchise. Really cool to see that they ordered and recalibrated
[354.60s -> 362.28s]  another one too. This is apparent. This is the second game. This is Katamari 2. I saw one bat
[362.28s -> 367.90s]  chest, which is a really good sign that usually, okay, if one person is bat-chesting something
[368.62s -> 372.38s]  and it's not a wave of them, then all right. Then that just means,
[373.02s -> 379.61s]  all right, come on. That means that that person's just, it's Katamari. You don't bat-chest Katamari
[379.61s -> 388.70s]  nowadays. No, we don't. Who does? You probably don't even know what the game is. You probably
[388.70s -> 393.34s]  don't even know what the game is. You just, you just saw that I was playing it and I was excited
[393.34s -> 404.44s]  about it. So you wanted to bat-chest to make me feel bad. You can quote that one too. Exactly.
[404.44s -> 409.88s]  Yeah. All right. Let's, I don't, I'm probably not going to stream for too, too long tonight.
[410.68s -> 418.52s]  I, I don't want to be excuse Andy, but I do have kind of a bad headache and it's going
[418.52s -> 426.58s]  to affect me. You can already tell like four or five hours from now. So not that short.
[426.58s -> 433.72s]  I just probably not like over six or seven hours. All right. You guys ready?
[434.20s -> 442.84s]  It's going to chill. It's going to be a chill stream. Oh, here it is.
[447.02s -> 455.83s]  Drink more water. I, I am. I don't just get up in the morning and go through my whole day and
[455.83s -> 464.06s]  afternoon just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, something's wrong today. I just, I just wish I, maybe if I
[464.06s -> 478.33s]  had one sip of water, who'd fix it? I drink a lot of water. I'll prove it. See? All right. Let's go.
[478.33s -> 487.14s]  Is the controller work? Oh, that's kind of loud. It's kind of loud for me.
[491.70s -> 499.72s]  No, I'm not a milk guy. Why do people ask that every week? Hey dude, are you, do you like,
[499.72s -> 503.32s]  are you like drink, do you like to drink milk and shit? It's like, why are you asking this question?
[503.32s -> 513.83s]  You ask it all the time. Hey dude, talk about milk for 20 minutes. Why do you want me to continue
[513.83s -> 529.37s]  to do this? All right. Let's watch. This is good. This game is so good too. I think this is probably
[529.37s -> 539.66s]  the best one, isn't it? Wasn't two, was two or three the best one? Yeah, two is the best one,
[539.66s -> 554.23s]  isn't it? We talked about video game soundtracks and how, what is actually the best video game
[554.23s -> 563.72s]  soundtrack? Katamari is probably up there in the top five. It is. It actually might be one or two.
[563.72s -> 571.03s]  It's possible. These games always had unbelievable soundtracks. Every single track was amazing. Every
[571.03s -> 583.13s]  single one. There wasn't a single bad song. It's definitely in the top five, top 10. We're not
[583.13s -> 594.76s]  skipping any songs. All right. Let's go. This is, I opened this. Making a new save. Yeah. I opened
[594.76s -> 599.00s]  the game just to capture it. So don't worry. I didn't play already. I'm going to be very upset
[599.00s -> 624.86s]  about that. Are you bald? No. I'm getting there though. I got another like at least five good
[624.86s -> 631.10s]  years. Bold yet sensitive and rugged to boot. Tolerant and compassionate with a heart deeper
[631.10s -> 638.41s]  than the oceans. Such is the great cosmos and the king that rules over it is marvelous to behold.
[638.97s -> 645.13s]  Except for the one time that he destroyed all the stars in the universe. No big deal really.
[646.41s -> 652.41s]  That was a good laugh. Having come to and realized the folly of his ways, the wisest of kings sent
[652.41s -> 657.61s]  to the planet earth, his beloved son, the prince, and commanded him to make a cotton
[665.29s -> 668.49s]  groove. You're not bald by eating an entire cantaloupe on screen.
[671.42s -> 680.65s]  That was an AI generated comment.
[702.49s -> 708.17s]  All up. Rolled and rolled until the Katamari was big enough to be lifted up to space to
[708.17s -> 716.33s]  replace the shiny stars that were so grievously lost. And that dear friends was the plot and
[716.33s -> 721.85s]  purpose of the fabulous game called. Katamari Daversley.
[728.30s -> 734.06s]  And it rolled right out of the game to bundle away the many and sundry ills that blight the
[734.06s -> 740.86s]  modern world. Overnight, the king found himself a superstar. The adulation of the crowd knew
[740.86s -> 753.19s]  no limits. Every audio book you've ever heard, by the way, every audio book you've ever listened to
[753.27s -> 761.53s]  is that oh dear such a chorus fans crying out from all and I love it by the way
[763.58s -> 799.61s]  to kill not enough stars. Oh, sweet memories. Yes, it was that time.
[800.81s -> 807.29s]  Time we smashed all the stars in the sky. It's like something out of a dream. We have totally
[807.29s -> 814.38s]  forgotten. What made us remember? The only place with stars is around earth.
[815.69s -> 822.09s]  Looks like Katamari Daversley was being lazy. Looks like Katamari Daversley had everyone fooled.
[823.22s -> 830.01s]  What impresses us all over is the scale of destruction we were. We were on a roll. Yes,
[830.01s -> 836.06s]  we were. Fierce and fabulous. We certainly were. We were really something. Yes, yes.
[836.86s -> 842.78s]  Oh, speaking of something, there is a tidbit. Not what we get. Not that we get it, but it seems
[842.78s -> 852.15s]  we're quite a hit. Go on. A big hit with earth. The stars are full of stuff. The star now apparently
[852.15s -> 860.82s]  full of our fans. Prince, prince, what do you think they love about us? Our looks, our tights,
[860.82s -> 868.90s]  our mustache. Oh, Eureka, we've got it. It's our chin. Yes, that must be it. Yes, must be.
[868.90s -> 872.98s]  Our chin is so magnificent. Earth is full of dedicated followers of our chin.
[874.02s -> 880.02s]  I want to hold your chin. Let me feel your goatee. They ask so nicely, so passionately. How can we
[880.02s -> 889.02s]  say no? So now, our prince, we must go to earth and grant our fans their wishes. Their wishes are
[889.02s -> 902.39s]  our chin's commands. Our chin's commands are our wishes. And so on. A succulent meal. Oh, that's
[902.39s -> 911.50s]  right. They did this overworld thing. Looks like the fans in the select plaza want to ask the prince
[911.50s -> 916.86s]  something. Talk to them. An icon will be displayed at the bottom of the screen when new fans arrive.
[916.86s -> 932.79s]  Make their dreams come true. I love this part. I'm going to turn it up a little.
[938.57s -> 946.06s]  Okay. Hi. Oh, I forgot. How do I do this? Nice to meet you, your highness. Boy, it was fun. I
[946.06s -> 951.74s]  think it must have been fun. I'm sorry. I've forgotten. I've completely forgotten how to roll
[951.74s -> 958.82s]  the Katamari. I know I'm a goof, but I love Katamari Devasi. Help me remember, please, Vittorio.
[963.42s -> 968.84s]  All right. Let's leave our fans on earth to the prince. Now, where shall we go and play?
[969.56s -> 976.28s]  Oh, it's the prince. What do you want with it? What? Oh, you forgot. Forgot how to roll the
[976.28s -> 982.97s]  Katamari? How to enjoy the Katamari? The meaning of life? Of course you forgot. The things you can't
[982.97s -> 989.74s]  forget that make you hurt. We think it may be better not to dredge things up. Your highness is
[989.74s -> 997.70s]  cool. Cool? No, it's important to remember. No, it's crucial to remember. Yes. Just try and think
[997.70s -> 1010.42s]  back. Yes. Yes. Bugleberry. Bugleberry voice. Lots of different applications. Friends that forgot all
[1010.42s -> 1020.98s]  about Katamari Devasi. Poor friends. Playing the very first game of Katamari Devasi. Would you guys
[1020.98s -> 1032.34s]  buy an audiobook? Just like a horror story read by Bugleberry? Was that something that you would
[1032.34s -> 1043.72s]  want? All right. So what is a Katamari? What could a Katamari be? What does Katamari taste like?
[1044.28s -> 1048.84s]  Does it have a point? Why roll? Why make it bigger? So many opinions and schools of thought,
[1048.84s -> 1055.51s]  but let's just try it out first. Hear ye, hear ye. We present to you an all and sundry the Katamari.
[1060.76s -> 1069.22s]  Only if it's at least eight hours. It would have to be a book that I got permission to read and
[1070.23s -> 1076.63s]  kind of have it licensed out to me or something. It would have to be a really obscure horror book
[1076.63s -> 1086.50s]  and it has to be less than 200 pages. Take the standard Katamari and roll it firmly.
[1086.50s -> 1094.18s]  Okay, it's a left and right stick. I kind of remember. All right, let's go.
[1100.22s -> 1120.66s]  Yeah, you go backwards. You can go side to side. Just spin around. There we go. Throw up some stuff.
[1120.66s -> 1126.47s]  The best part of the game. This is okay. This whole game is just oddly satisfying the entire
[1126.47s -> 1130.97s]  game. If you actually never played this before, even seen this be played, get it. Go get it right
[1130.97s -> 1149.58s]  now. Get it now. If there's one thing you do this week, this game, this game is not expensive,
[1149.58s -> 1159.58s]  right? I think it's like 20 bucks, 30 bucks. It wasn't that bad, right? 30 bucks.
[1159.58s -> 1176.04s]  What the heck am I looking at? You're looking at a very, very good video game.
[1185.32s -> 1187.80s]  All right, we have to overcome the wall. Not big enough yet.
[1195.45s -> 1199.29s]  Soundtrack is so good too. Just wait till you hear some of these classic beats.
[1203.29s -> 1214.14s]  Oh, I can go down. All right. Wowies, you got up there. Prince turn. Oh, that's huge. Yep.
[1214.14s -> 1226.76s]  That's a big, that's a big freaking deal. Quick turn. You can also do the Katamari view. You can
[1226.76s -> 1231.96s]  just kind of take a look. These things get ready. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody that doesn't
[1231.96s -> 1237.46s]  know. This game is just really fucking good. That's all you need to know. Okay. Prince view.
[1239.90s -> 1250.54s]  Ah, miracle eye. How are this? That's just zoom. Miracle eye. All right, then we're going to do the
[1250.54s -> 1258.84s]  dash. The dash is just going to go. When you're just a little bigger, you could maybe roll ace up
[1258.84s -> 1264.92s]  here. This is ace, a cousin to the prince or a cousin once removed. We forgot. Cousin, kin,
[1264.92s -> 1271.32s]  something like that. Alrighty. Time for you to challenge ace head on. If you go like this, you
[1271.32s -> 1285.62s]  can go fast. Somebody put a different soundtrack on. What? I'm not going to put a different
[1285.62s -> 1291.62s]  soundtrack on one of the greatest soundtracks of all time in all video games. Can we get a
[1291.62s -> 1295.94s]  poll up to see this is Katamari Damacy soundtrack. One of the most important pieces of media in
[1295.94s -> 1310.34s]  history. Yes or no. Can we get a vote? All right, let's get them. Ah, fabulous. You're pretty good.
[1310.98s -> 1324.28s]  Anyway, let's go back. Royal rainbow. Is Katamari soundtrack a big deal? That's a good vague way
[1324.28s -> 1333.45s]  of word it. I like it. Is it a big deal? Hmm. Was it like this? Katamari Damacy? Honestly,
[1333.45s -> 1342.18s]  this is not what we were thinking. But looks kind of fun. A kind of sort of fun game. 18 centimeters,
[1342.18s -> 1348.82s]  seven millimeters. We see we are a little tough. So big. It's just a training run. An unbelievable
[1348.82s -> 1356.34s]  size. Astonishing really. Very and truly fabulous. Oh, it's cousin ace. What were you doing on earth?
[1357.58s -> 1364.20s]  You at the tutorial stage? We have no idea what you're talking about. Hmm, this feels kind of,
[1364.20s -> 1373.80s]  this feels strange-ish. Not that we understand if that's a good thing or not. Oh, wow. I remembered
[1373.80s -> 1378.86s]  everything. Really everything this time. It's totally the best. Katamari Damacy. Your highness,
[1378.86s -> 1385.74s]  thank you so much. This Katamari is just a token of my thanks. I'd like to offer it to you. Oh,
[1385.74s -> 1390.38s]  really? You're giving it to us? Seriously, fabulous. Thank you. We are so pleased.
[1391.02s -> 1395.66s]  What should we do with it? Oh, we can pop it up into the cosmos. Yes, that's what we do.
[1396.54s -> 1405.27s]  Oh, all right. So you guys agree. Look, it's a star now. Wow. It's so beautiful.
[1405.91s -> 1420.33s]  Are you going to play the Jump King DLC? No. We totally forgot to tell you, but this is the
[1420.33s -> 1426.97s]  select plaza. Talk to fans. Chat with cousins. Do a little saving. Look at your collection.
[1427.53s -> 1431.93s]  Move around a little maybe while pressing X or right bumper. When you get tired of rolling,
[1431.93s -> 1443.69s]  just hang out here. Okay. Cool. I think we can. Yep. We can change. Should I be ace or should
[1443.69s -> 1458.18s]  I be the prince? I'll be ace. Collection 0.4%. Options. I think we're good with audio and
[1458.18s -> 1461.94s]  everything. I mean, I put the graphics in a good spot. All right. Let's do the next one.
[1461.94s -> 1467.70s]  I want to see the Royal Rainbow. Hello, your highness. I just love you. That beard, that nose,
[1467.70s -> 1474.50s]  that chin, that style. I love it all. But I love the Royal Rainbow the best of all.
[1475.22s -> 1485.14s]  My dream is to see a real live one. Please show me. Oh, but of course I'll show you. We are hungry.
[1485.14s -> 1494.38s]  Our tummy is empty. What shall we eat? Oh, it's ace. Hmm. What? What kind of food? Huh? Royal
[1494.38s -> 1502.50s]  Rainbow. Why, when our tummy is so empty? No way. Boring. Your highness, you're so striking.
[1503.46s -> 1511.24s]  Striking. Oh, we so like rainbows. You must simply must, you simply must see it.
[1511.96s -> 1524.26s]  Should we go ahead and make a Katamari too? Yes. Yes. Yes. Let's go. All right. Yes. I'm so ready
[1524.26s -> 1530.92s]  for this. We're hungry. Oh, let's roll here. This is an earth home, so unbelievably small.
[1532.28s -> 1538.82s]  Plenty spacious for ace, but not so much for us. Oh, we forgot about the Katamari. How about this
[1538.82s -> 1546.04s]  much time to make this big Katamari? Three minutes or 15 centimeters. If you can manage,
[1546.04s -> 1555.99s]  that would be nice. All righty, ace. It's all yours now. Let's go. Oh, your first ever roll-up.
[1557.56s -> 1566.42s]  It's six out of 10 today. It's six, 10. Congratulations. What did I even get? All
[1566.42s -> 1579.27s]  right. I gotta go. Only three minutes. Yep. Nice. All right. The food. I don't want to leave until I
[1579.27s -> 1593.90s]  get everything. What was it? 15 centimeters. All right. Yeah. All right. I gotta go this way.
[1594.70s -> 1612.58s]  Too small to get anything else. I can't get the cat. Not yet. I want to get the cereal box too.
[1612.58s -> 1625.70s]  Remind me of the cereal box up there. Oh, shit. That's bad. Maybe not. No, it's okay. Oh, cousin.
[1628.42s -> 1640.41s]  Come here, cousin. Yes. You just rolled up some weird buffness. Wait. Second cousin macho. Oh,
[1640.41s -> 1654.97s]  stop kidding in the way. Second cousin macho. Can't get these. All right. I'm almost there.
[1654.97s -> 1662.89s]  I got plenty of time. 15, right? Not big enough for the tennis balls.
[1663.53s -> 1672.79s]  Oh, look at all this. Look at how juicy this is. One minute left. We got it.
[1678.47s -> 1681.19s]  All right. I'm big enough to. I don't think I'm big enough for the cat.
[1682.89s -> 1697.22s]  15 centimeters already. We asked for a 15. Wait, what? This would be exact? Does it have to be
[1697.22s -> 1712.36s]  exact? No, I don't think so. Make it bigger. Oh, your first ever crash. Wait, what? It's six,
[1712.36s -> 1723.43s]  10. Today is six, 10. The birthday of your first crash. Congratulations. I want to get all this
[1723.43s -> 1736.28s]  stuff, but it's all right. Yup. Come on. Oh, sorry. I love this game. Our tummy is empty. You're done.
[1736.92s -> 1744.46s]  Shall we go home and get something to eat? Yes. Turn the music up. I'll go in the options and
[1744.46s -> 1754.25s]  turn it up a little. I'm looking at my tags again. Tournament art, dislike boat cheese,
[1754.25s -> 1758.97s]  not the sus guy. Stop asking. This is we're going to find this stream and look at those tags and be
[1758.97s -> 1766.66s]  like, I fucking hate this guy. I would read those tags and go, I hate this streamer. I don't like
[1766.66s -> 1776.02s]  this guy. Like this cream puff that looks so good. Oh, it's Katamari. That was a surprise, but what
[1776.02s -> 1785.24s]  a word. I don't know. 18 centimeters. Yes. Well, so undistinguished. You can go bigger. You know,
[1785.32s -> 1794.10s]  do us a favor and roll a bigger one. Oh, it's second cousin Macho. What were you doing on Earth?
[1795.22s -> 1798.90s]  Making friends with the crayfish. I have no idea what you're talking about.
[1799.70s -> 1809.80s]  This feels, uh, snacks-ish. I had mostly snacks. That's better. Do we understand what snacks mean?
[1810.44s -> 1816.09s]  I got to see the Royal Rainbow, but it wasn't exactly lively. I think it's because the Katamari
[1816.09s -> 1836.98s]  was so small. I'll give your highness this stale old Katamari. Oh no. Okay. Into the cosmos. Oh,
[1836.98s -> 1899.50s]  it's a star now. Wow. It's so beautiful. Wrong voice. Biscuit Uranus. That storyboard was quite
[1899.50s -> 1907.30s]  interesting. It's a storyboard, but the pictures move. There's music. Extreme storyboard. That's
[1907.30s -> 1916.50s]  what it is. It's called a movie. A fascinating movie. So that storyboard movie, what it showed
[1916.50s -> 1924.89s]  is a glimpse into our youthful days. A pretty tumultuous tale of daring do. We can't wait for
[1924.89s -> 1930.62s]  episode two, but if we keep rolling, we'll eventually get to see it. All righty. We're
[1930.62s -> 1938.66s]  going to roll on ahead. See you later. Battle mode has been unlocked. Talk with the one player and
[1938.66s -> 1958.20s]  two player characters together. Where's Macho? Probably should save the game. There is an auto
[1958.20s -> 1970.50s]  save, but I don't trust it. Okay. Usual stuff? Controls usual stuff. Yeah. All right. Rumble.
[1970.50s -> 1975.24s]  It's fine. All right. Here we go. Background music. We want the sound effects a little bit lower,
[1975.24s -> 1985.40s]  but we want the music a little higher. That's correct, right? All right. We got a lot of new
[1985.40s -> 1989.24s]  things going on. All right. What are you doing? I'm really sleepy, but first I want to see a big
[1989.24s -> 1994.82s]  Katamari. The songs you can set to background music increase as you play the game. Set your
[1994.82s -> 2005.43s]  favorite song to the BGM using Y. Hey King dude, you're so cool and relaxed lounging around as
[2005.43s -> 2011.37s]  usual. I love Katamari Damacy. I love how mellow it is. I'm copying Katamari Damacy and lounging
[2011.37s -> 2017.94s]  around. Oh, now I'm falling asleep before I do. I want to see a real Katamari. Come on, dude.
[2017.94s -> 2036.23s]  Show me. Oof. We were asleep. Our eyes opened. Oh, Macho. What? What? He wants to see a Katamari
[2036.23s -> 2043.99s]  before he goes to bed? What? Are you serious? Oh, this is Katamari Damacy. We are not that easy.
[2044.79s -> 2052.17s]  We work hard at rolling, you know. No, no, not possible. Cannot be done. No. Your highness is
[2052.17s -> 2064.20s]  the best. The best? No, not impossible. Not at all. Yes, you are very and absolutely right. If anything,
[2064.20s -> 2080.97s]  we should play except just before bed. Yes. All aboard. Let's make a Katamari. It's the best.
[2080.97s -> 2088.54s]  So sleepy after all. Let's roll here. It's a room again, but let's just work on getting it big.
[2088.54s -> 2097.43s]  You make it bigger, you can roll it in lots of other places. Um, let's see. How about this much
[2097.43s -> 2106.06s]  time to make this big? A Katamari. If you can manage, that would be nice. All righty, Macho.
[2106.06s -> 2125.61s]  It's all yours now. All right. Got to be, got to be big. Start with the basics. Shit. I'm losing
[2125.61s -> 2133.50s]  time here. I got to get bigger. All right. Sorry, we fell. No, this is perfect. Actually, perfect.
[2146.10s -> 2154.55s]  Oh, I'm not big enough for the nail polish or whatever it is. I have to come back here.
[2154.55s -> 2162.02s]  Something is coming. What do you mean something is coming? All right. I get the batteries. Here
[2162.02s -> 2173.58s]  we go. Nice. I think I can get all these batteries. Yep. And the locks, too. Yeah, I'm going to get
[2173.58s -> 2189.98s]  all this stuff. Where's the prince? I changed character. I went to Macho. All right. A few more
[2189.98s -> 2208.79s]  things. Something's coming. Nice. All right. I'm big enough for the toothbrushes. Can I go outside?
[2208.79s -> 2229.90s]  No, I have to be 20 centimeters. All right. I'll probably upgrade here in a sec. You should speed
[2229.90s -> 2241.34s]  run this game. Um, no, it's all right. I like just playing this game. All right. It's about,
[2241.34s -> 2257.18s]  we're about to snowball here in about 10 seconds, I want to say. Oh, all right. I'm going to go
[2257.18s -> 2268.82s]  through the middle. All right. Loading cans. Ah, finally, we can talk. We have a little trouble
[2268.82s -> 2273.80s]  with loading. You can't talk during loading. You know, we finally have our voice back, but we can't
[2273.80s -> 2283.40s]  talk when it first starts loading. Goodness gracious. We're sleepy. We're just such a sleepyhead.
[2285.54s -> 2292.34s]  You can get to more places if you roll on from here. We're very drowsy, but we'll keep it together.
[2294.62s -> 2298.33s]  All right. We can. I'm not going to leave yet though. Like this stuff in here that I don't want
[2298.33s -> 2315.86s]  to. How much time do I have? Four minutes. These are big. All these tuna cans. Oh yeah. All right.
[2315.86s -> 2335.27s]  I'll go now. Oh, I got a crayfish. Can I go out out? Oh my goodness. I think I can. All right. I
[2335.27s -> 2350.33s]  gotta hurry up. Everything's a little too big. There we go. Oh my gosh. I can't get the little
[2350.33s -> 2379.78s]  elephants. Oh shit. That hurt. Give me all this food. Shit. I'm not big enough. Oh well. I need
[2379.78s -> 2409.51s]  to be 40 or 50. I gotta go speed this way. Get it. It's 40. I'll get it. I need to upgrade one more
[2409.51s -> 2419.99s]  time and I'll be able to get all this other stuff. There we go. Give me the bottles. All right. I'm
[2419.99s -> 2438.28s]  good. Look at this over here. Look at all this shit to get. I think I get 50 or 60. This dude
[2438.28s -> 2465.18s]  is never playing Zelda. You're probably right. You're probably right, man. I'll be happy with
[2465.18s -> 2495.61s]  50. Oh I got somebody. A present. Oh no. I didn't get. I got a present. Did I get the lizard? Oh
[2495.61s -> 2503.48s]  give me all this. I could get so much bigger if I just pick up some more of this. Cousin was in the
[2503.48s -> 2515.40s]  house. Your Katamari is as big as 17 of these toolboxes. That's cool. I missed a cousin.
[2515.40s -> 2535.29s]  That's okay. But I don't know. I might play it. I had a lot of fun but I don't know. I don't have a
[2535.29s -> 2541.82s]  plan. You know what I mean? We fell asleep with our eyes open. Oh there's a Katamari here.
[2541.82s -> 2549.08s]  Came out of nowhere. 63 centimeters. Makes us sort of sleepy. It's not small but it's a
[2549.08s -> 2558.92s]  stale Katamari. So average. We think you can make it much bigger. Wow. We got a camera as a present.
[2558.92s -> 2565.80s]  Fabulous. We love cameras but it's far too small for us. Macho. You can have it from a fan so make
[2565.80s -> 2574.98s]  sure you appreciate it. This feels like this Katamari feels necessities-ish. Like what was
[2574.98s -> 2581.77s]  that mean? Doesn't sound very nice. What do you call this feeling? I'm awake but not alert.
[2582.49s -> 2589.62s]  Hungry too. I mean this is just a regular old Katamari. You can have this one dude. Oh really?
[2589.62s -> 2594.66s]  You're giving it to us? Seriously. Fabulous. Thank you. We're so pleased. What should we do with it?
[2594.66s -> 2609.30s]  Into the cosmos. Oh it's a planet now. Awesome dude. I want to travel the universe in my dreams.
[2611.98s -> 2625.32s]  Play Breath of the Wild off stream. Yes. I don't know. By the way, are you using all those presents
[2625.32s -> 2631.08s]  from our fans? Do you know how to use them? You know the birthday cake in the select plaza? Yes.
[2631.72s -> 2641.13s]  Go there to put on your presents. They'll give you a snazzy new look. Little costume pieces.
[2641.13s -> 2644.01s]  You get a camera as a present. You can take pictures with the Prince camera
[2644.81s -> 2648.97s]  in Prince view. Take a picture of any stickers you find with the camera. Collect a lot to get a
[2650.97s -> 2669.03s]  picture frame. Oh okay. You can take a selfie using Selfie from Prince camera. Really? Okay well
[2669.03s -> 2678.22s]  we're going to put the camera on. Cool. Alright let's get on. Put a video of Zelda being played
[2678.22s -> 2685.21s]  in the corner. I need Zelda sensory videos going on for you guys to want to watch the stream.
[2685.21s -> 2701.82s]  Alright this one's like a beach level but what else we got? Your Majesty 8%. Alright let's do
[2701.82s -> 2713.13s]  this one. A new approach to Ikebana? What is Novell Ikebana? What does it mean to be new is
[2713.13s -> 2722.07s]  newness? What is new Ikebana? What is Novell Ikebana? Am I saying this wrong? I'd like to ask
[2722.07s -> 2735.43s]  your dynamic highness. We like red roses. The divine flowers. The deadly thorns. Oh shivers. Oh
[2735.43s -> 2752.38s]  macho. What? It's pronounced. How do you pronounce it? Ikebana. Ikebana? We like roses so we're all
[2752.38s -> 2762.87s]  about gardening. No interest in Ikebana though. Not at all. Your highness is so sensual. Sensual?
[2765.13s -> 2772.46s]  Ikebana is too fabulous. We think this is the time for Ikebana. Off we go to create a new style.
[2778.62s -> 2786.15s]  Oh wonderful. This is the land of dreams. It's so beautiful. We are awestruck by the power of mother
[2786.15s -> 2793.37s]  nature. Oh completely slipped our mind. How about this much time to roll up as many flowers as you
[2793.37s -> 2800.50s]  can and make a beautiful herbaceous katamari. Alrighty macho. It's all yours now. Pick up flowers.
[2800.50s -> 2826.44s]  I don't know how many you need. I think it's just as many as you can get. Anything? Like I want to
[2826.44s -> 2838.18s]  get that big one in the middle. I don't want to neglect any certain area. Really easy to do that
[2838.18s -> 2858.17s]  in this game. How? You'll miss everything that moves. Oh wonderful. It ran off. Macho you silly
[2858.17s -> 2878.52s]  goose. What wait talking about the getting hit by the what was it an animal? Ow. That's good enough.
[2881.85s -> 2896.55s]  Can I get everybody yet? Let me see can I get this person? Yep. Can I pick up the grass?
[2897.75s -> 2909.91s]  Yep all right I'm gonna go up. Whoa that was that was a bird okay.
[2910.79s -> 2918.28s]  Sunflowers yep. I'm gonna go all the way down on the other side.
[2930.81s -> 2936.39s]  All right I'm gonna go the other side now. This is a whole entire what is over there all right
[2936.39s -> 2952.71s]  I'm gonna go this way. 600 I wonder how many I need to be good. I'm going down here.
[2955.27s -> 2978.50s]  Can I pick up the actual? Yeah I can. How big am I? One meter. You have to roll up moving things
[2978.50s -> 2993.22s]  before they run off. So romantic. Two minutes? All right what about the all right in here.
[2993.94s -> 3008.31s]  What's that? A flower. It's rather large isn't it? All right let's see if I'm big enough to pick
[3008.31s -> 3027.82s]  up more bigger things. Not yet. Am I really not big enough to pick that up? No. 700 oh a lot over
[3027.82s -> 3060.65s]  here. 800. Shit. Oh oh I gotta get over a thousand. Oh cousin. This is gonna be close.
[3061.29s -> 3088.52s]  Oh come on. There we go a thousand nice. Right when I get big enough to actually start picking
[3088.52s -> 3106.98s]  up everything. Oh it's all right I got to a thousand. Go. Okie dokie mokey all done with
[3106.98s -> 3113.67s]  the flower power katamari. Your katamari is as big as four thousand three hundred of these.
[3113.67s -> 3137.32s]  Well that's pretty flowered up already. Want to go home now? Yes. Passionate love. Passionate
[3137.32s -> 3146.28s]  amore. The international message of the red rose. So fabulous. Too fabulous. This katamari
[3146.28s -> 3154.76s]  is fabulous too. Wait when did you make this? One thousand flowers. Oh it sort of has that never
[3154.76s -> 3160.12s]  before seen vibe. It's a katamari but kind of soft. A katamari that dares to wear perfume.
[3161.26s -> 3164.70s]  But fairly certain there are far more beautiful katamaris out there.
[3168.06s -> 3174.30s]  Oh it's cousin Ichigo. What were you doing on earth? Traveling on the back of a baby deer.
[3174.30s -> 3182.14s]  We have no idea what you're talking about. This feels kind of flowers-ish. That was mostly what
[3182.14s -> 3186.79s]  was there. Of course it's probably because you paid nothing but flowers. I'm starting to see
[3186.79s -> 3192.49s]  something now. There's a clue in this katamari. From here on I have to find it for myself.
[3193.05s -> 3196.89s]  Yes thank you so much your highness. Please keep this katamari as token of my thanks.
[3197.85s -> 3215.37s]  Okay let's make it a planet. I wish you were named Luigi. Why? The sunflower planet. Oh
[3215.37s -> 3222.68s]  probably gonna have some major sunflower updates. In the next week or two I would say
[3222.68s -> 3258.98s]  it'll be a major sunflower update. Are you growing a sunflower out of your ass? Um yeah let's just go
[3258.98s -> 3271.72s]  with yeah. I'm gonna make this person really excited. The answer is no but whatever. Cool okay.
[3274.44s -> 3302.36s]  Let's play with Ichigo. Hello please can you clean this up? Music list. Hold on. Should I
[3302.36s -> 3305.72s]  pick a song? Register your favorite songs. Once you've registered more than two songs you can
[3305.72s -> 3320.54s]  set a favorite. I don't know if we can do this yet. Not yet. The real thing is something else.
[3320.54s -> 3324.94s]  Anyway nice to meet you your highness. You're as stylish as ever. I'm a parent with a son in
[3324.94s -> 3334.65s]  elementary school. He loves katamari too. He likes the rolling up part. He rolls up everything so
[3334.65s -> 3341.90s]  there's nothing left. But his room is a huge mess. Seems he can tidy up things in the game but
[3342.70s -> 3352.74s]  your highness please do something. I feel this. When a game asks me to clean, like my favorite
[3352.74s -> 3358.90s]  part of the whole game but cleaning up my own desk is like nah nah I fuck that. I don't want
[3358.90s -> 3371.53s]  to do that. Why is that? Why? I will spend six hours making sure the desk in the game is pristine
[3372.25s -> 3384.22s]  but not my own real desk. We tidied it all up in the last Katamari Damacy. Ichigo do you even get
[3384.22s -> 3390.46s]  that part? Huh? What the kids room? What happened to our story about cleaning up the universe?
[3390.54s -> 3399.86s]  Did we finish talking? We don't care about kids rooms. Actually I love Katamari. Love it.
[3399.86s -> 3406.50s]  You say kids room we say miniature universe. Did you know that? We're very good at cleaning up
[3406.50s -> 3420.33s]  miniature universe. Anyway let's go tidy. Rarely compared to the universe this isn't cluttered at
[3420.33s -> 3429.58s]  all but still bothers us. It bothers our love of order. Is this many things cluttering this room?
[3429.58s -> 3436.38s]  So let's clean them all up as quickly as possible. We know you can do it Ichigo. Alrighty
[3436.38s -> 3449.06s]  good luck. All right I gotta get everything. Oh present. Shit okay I gotta get everything.
[3452.63s -> 3465.02s]  I'll have to come back up here. Shit I'm really not big enough besides I can only pick up gum.
[3465.82s -> 3477.90s]  There's no time limit so this one this is fine. Oh doesn't some weird caterpillar.
[3478.06s -> 3485.42s]  Wait it's second cousin Lamor. Oh stop. I don't know what he said.
[3496.84s -> 3501.90s]  Ow all right there we go now I can really start to move.
[3504.14s -> 3515.14s]  This one's this one's banging. Yeah this is a good one.
[3516.66s -> 3520.18s]  32 remaining. If I do this in under four and five minutes I'll be happy.
[3522.47s -> 3534.98s]  Come on. Come on hurry up. Back up for the gift now. I'll make sure to get that before I'm done.
[3544.60s -> 3558.87s]  Let's head back up. All right this is the start. Give me that present. All right got a gift.
[3559.51s -> 3573.70s]  I think that's just the stuff over here now. I got the character right. Yeah I'm good. It's
[3573.70s -> 3591.08s]  the last item right here. Two. Shit what did I miss? I don't know what I missed.
[3593.37s -> 3609.45s]  Oh something up here. Yep one more item. Find blind. Am I? What do you mean? Where is it?
[3614.18s -> 3624.42s]  Ah under three minutes I'm happy with it. I'm happy with under three.
[3624.42s -> 3640.79s]  There's a lot of gwa in this franchise.
[3673.62s -> 3676.58s]  So stylish and connected but it's far too small for us.
[3677.30s -> 3680.74s]  Ichigo you can have it. For the fans I'll make sure you appreciate it.
[3681.46s -> 3685.78s]  Oh it's second cousin Lamor. What were you doing on earth?
[3686.74s -> 3693.06s]  Nothing much. Well that was unexpectedly honest. Oh great the end of day sale is over. I could
[3693.06s -> 3698.34s]  have gone if the cleanup were done faster and better. Oh no what am I going to do about dinner?
[3698.34s -> 3705.80s]  You can have this thing your highness. Why does everybody hate me? You're giving it to us? Okay.
[3713.98s -> 3734.71s]  Untidy planet. It's so pretty once it's a planet because you are so fucking slow. Do you ever think
[3734.71s -> 3740.44s]  that you're going too fast? Do you know what I mean? Do you ever think that you should slow down a
[3740.44s -> 3750.70s]  little? Do you know what I'm saying? Am I going too slow or are you going too fast? Looks like it
[3750.70s -> 3755.10s]  would be shocking to touch. It brings us back but we don't want to remember this how to say it. We
[3755.10s -> 3763.06s]  forgot. Are you curious? So then try out the shock. It looks dirty so we won't touch it.
[3769.21s -> 3784.02s]  Okay bamboo sword of memory. What does it do? Enough playtime prince. The king of all cosmos
[3784.02s -> 3789.72s]  needs knowledge and strength. The road to the throne is long and hard. If you have time to play
[3789.72s -> 3795.13s]  then roll a katamari. Experience the king's memories. You'll gain access to more memories
[3795.13s -> 3808.58s]  as you make fans dreams come true in the select plaza. Oh do I have anything to do yet?
[3809.22s -> 3822.62s]  Study time. This is new content. Oh okay well I'll wait to do this later. This is what kind of like
[3822.62s -> 3829.32s]  new DLC. Oh no it's part of the remake then because this game did have DLC didn't it?
[3830.54s -> 3839.72s]  Old old Xbox live DLC or was that the third one? Oh my god that scared the shit out of me.
[3840.52s -> 3857.43s]  Yeah I have I'm I'm just thinking of the explosion from like three weeks ago.
[3858.23s -> 3863.93s]  I want to roll up the brightness. Wait I want to be the new character.
[3864.49s -> 3874.26s]  Where's the new character? There you are. La Amor and I want to put on some new clothes.
[3874.26s -> 3890.31s]  Here's the cake. Cool all right let's do it. I'm a dog but I love Katamari Damacy. I play it
[3890.31s -> 3897.13s]  constantly when I'm in the dog house. I play against other dogs too. I was just thinking can't
[3897.13s -> 3910.14s]  you roll up the sun? I'm sure you can. You can roll it up. Katamari Damacy is cool don't you
[3910.14s -> 3916.14s]  think La Amor? Really there's even a dog in our fan base. Doggy play too? How cute.
[3918.15s -> 3925.93s]  What about the dog? What what did she say? She said why don't we roll up the sun. Really? We want
[3925.93s -> 3937.38s]  to hear her too. Woof the sun. Woof woof. She said sun almost maybe maybe almost nearly. But we are
[3937.38s -> 3951.62s]  so moved by our canine fan that we will roll it up. The sun anyway. Wowies you're finally here
[3951.62s -> 3958.82s]  it's space. Outer space. Okie dokie. Want to go for the sun? Want to roll the earth and roll up
[3958.82s -> 3976.70s]  the sun? We know you can do it. All righty good luck. Oh I don't think I'm gonna be able to do
[3976.70s -> 3997.48s]  this. Oh it's Cassiopeia. We made that you know. I think I can't do this until the that sun. Wait
[3997.48s -> 4020.92s]  not yet. But this is the planets that I have now. Yep yeah so okay there you go ready. I definitely
[4020.92s -> 4036.97s]  don't have enough. Oh too bad too bad. It's because the Katamari is still too small.
[4037.77s -> 4043.77s]  Which means that there's not enough stars in the cosmos. Not enough not enough so not enough.
[4043.77s -> 4055.74s]  Okay uh let's go to the beach. Sounds fun. Nice to meet you your majesty. I don't look
[4055.74s -> 4061.77s]  it but I'm a complete brick. Sure I can swim but my dream is to be a gold medalist. I'm thinking
[4061.77s -> 4068.12s]  the 100 meter butterfly since I need to practice anyway let's try rolling underwater. We couldn't
[4068.12s -> 4078.14s]  go underwater in the first Katamari Demasi. What do you think? You want to roll? Yeah. Have you
[4078.14s -> 4083.22s]  never played this game before or something? I'm getting tired of your decision making. What?
[4083.22s -> 4096.66s]  You roll over objects with a ball. It's not like I have to choose who lives or dies. I'm literally
[4096.66s -> 4108.38s]  rolling objects over with a big ball. We prefer the mountains to the beach. What about you? I mean
[4108.38s -> 4116.97s]  yeah I played this game 20 years ago when it came out for PlayStation 2. It's been been almost two
[4116.97s -> 4125.00s]  decades since I've played this game. What do you want about underwater not the mountains or the
[4125.00s -> 4143.75s]  beach? Well there goes our vacation buzz. You streamed the game. This is a different video game.
[4143.75s -> 4147.99s]  This is do you not wait hold on a minute. Do some of you think this is the same remake from two
[4147.99s -> 4172.10s]  years ago? What are you guys on about? You already did this. This is a different game. Is it? I mean
[4172.10s -> 4177.30s]  the concept of rolling up objects is the same but I don't I don't understand what the what the
[4177.30s -> 4202.82s]  concern is. All right let's go. Six minutes. We need 80 centimeters poisonous. Oh there we go.
[4209.46s -> 4221.54s]  You're a lot slower underwater too. Am I too small to pick up anything down here?
[4228.31s -> 4265.38s]  Oh the ocean floor. There we go. We'll get a little bigger this way. Go this way.
[4268.54s -> 4282.20s]  Oh shit. All right. Real didn't. What a quirky laundry. Okay I didn't even see that one.
[4292.18s -> 4294.66s]  Oh my god. I just fucking got like magnetized to it.
[4295.38s -> 4307.96s]  It's like I couldn't even move. Oh my god. I have no control of the character right now.
[4321.54s -> 4354.84s]  There we go. Oh can I not switch? Yeah I can. There we go. Go fast. Am I big enough to pick
[4354.84s -> 4388.46s]  the crabs up yet? No. How big does it need to be? 60? 180. I got plenty of time. What? They're too
[4388.46s -> 4415.90s]  big. I thought I was going to get all of them. Excuse me. I named one of my koi after you. Like
[4415.90s -> 4437.82s]  the fish? That's pretty cool. You got a koi? Damn. Now let's try to snowball this. Go fast.
[4438.38s -> 4460.31s]  Oh give me the present. I want that present so bad. Give it to me. Give me the present.
[4466.34s -> 4491.86s]  Come on. Wasting time. Yeah I got plenty of time. Well I can get the big crabs now. Now
[4491.86s -> 4515.62s]  is the time to go get it. Okay. Can I get these yet? No. I might. I'll probably get 100. I don't
[4515.62s -> 4534.74s]  like how floaty you are underwater. Spit around. I didn't get the present but whatever. It's all
[4534.74s -> 4565.70s]  right. Give me 100. Well I got a. All right that's a fine number. I got a glug. Nice glug glug go home.
[4576.58s -> 4593.58s]  Same number as my IQ. That's right. Brilliant. A lot of crabs. Bob float and roll up.
[4595.37s -> 4616.54s]  Oh we did get a new cousin. He's riding the manta ray. Okay cool. Cool. No underwater skills. I get
[4616.54s -> 4620.94s]  it. I shouldn't have suggested rolling underwater. I don't need this brick katamari. You can have it
[4620.94s -> 4692.17s]  already. They're never happy with what we do. Shhh cutscene. Stop laughing. I'm laughing at
[4692.17s -> 4714.73s]  mod chat because they posted 985 new record. You weren't paying attention. Yes I was. We want to
[4714.73s -> 4727.32s]  eat something sweet. Oh okay. Hansel and Gretel. We love Katamari Damacy but we love sweets too.
[4727.96s -> 4744.22s]  Okay let's do it. Should we make an album? Like a music album? What do you want me to do? Like
[4744.22s -> 4755.34s]  have some of the tracks just be poetry. Okay we actually it's not easy for us either. It's not
[4755.42s -> 4761.42s]  easy to just sit and watch. No. Huh? What? Sweets? You want to eat sweets? Well we want to eat them
[4761.42s -> 4778.58s]  too. Really and honestly a good idea. Now let's go eat. Rock opera concert. I don't know if I'm
[4778.58s -> 4785.11s]  capable of doing that. The gingerbread house. It smells like buttercream. So yummy. No we must
[4785.11s -> 4793.46s]  control ourselves. Already you have this much time to roll up the gingerbread house. Then once the
[4793.46s -> 4805.94s]  sweets. Did I play this game like six years ago? Seven years ago? Like the original version on like
[4805.94s -> 4818.63s]  PlayStation 2 for like an hour or something. Maybe not this one. It's all yours now. Let's go.
[4821.37s -> 4840.30s]  Wait I'm gonna get all these. These hamburger buns? Holy shit. It's a good game. I don't think I played
[4840.30s -> 4845.82s]  the original one if I did. It was probably during like a PlayStation 2 fuckface night.
[4846.78s -> 4854.47s]  Probably only played for like an hour or so. From like almost half a decade, decade ago.
[4854.47s -> 4857.35s]  Let's go. I don't think it was this one though.
[4869.37s -> 4874.06s]  Oh you're gonna. Give me that. Give me that present. I gotta get big enough to get that.
[4874.06s -> 4897.42s]  Remind me of that later. No. I'll go back and get the rest of those later.
[4898.22s -> 4914.07s]  Oh shit I just picked them both. No I didn't. I got one. Okay all. Wait what? All done. Oh shit.
[4916.39s -> 4921.13s]  No no I don't want to go home. The goal was to roll them up at the end. Oh I'm sorry.
[4921.77s -> 4932.92s]  All right we got it. Oh sorry I didn't read that part. We're good. I was reading chat. Sorry we'll
[4932.92s -> 4948.79s]  make it better. I'm gonna stay in the house. I'm not gonna leave this till it's all gone.
[4970.39s -> 4976.55s]  All right I'm already much bigger now. Okay once it's big enough. Okay so it is big enough.
[4978.07s -> 4983.93s]  Am I big enough for the fork? No shit.
[4983.93s -> 5013.83s]  Come on. I got two minutes. I gotta get to a thousand. Come here. Give me that treasure.
[5016.42s -> 5047.69s]  What? Am I seriously not big enough? Get over here. All right we're good. One minute. I got time.
[5060.71s -> 5084.86s]  30. At 20 seconds I'm gonna go for it. All right we're good.
[5085.50s -> 5104.17s]  That's good enough. 1300. 1400. German streams. Katamari Damacy reroll from four years ago.
[5104.17s -> 5107.53s]  Yeah that's the that's the first one. This is the second one. This is the second remake.
[5119.08s -> 5132.46s]  You did beautiful Katamari at the end of 2019. That's true. This isn't Damacy because we love
[5132.46s -> 5138.31s]  Katamari. That's right. All right they had to have been happy about this right? So here we are. This
[5138.31s -> 5143.19s]  is the sweet Katamari. The Katamari that even we could only dream of. It's full of sugary goodness.
[5143.99s -> 5153.85s]  Unbelievable. Okay. I think they're happy about it. Wow. We got a long nose as a present. Fabulous.
[5153.85s -> 5171.35s]  Oh cool. You wanted to eat cookies? Do you save any cookies for us? Snacks-ish. We're covered in
[5171.35s -> 5175.99s]  cream and crumbs after getting rolled up in the sweets Katamari. Oof we're full now. You can have
[5175.99s -> 5198.71s]  the rest your highness. Oh they're very happy. Good. As long as they're happy. 2.9? That's not bad.
[5207.27s -> 5212.17s]  Hmm new. All right let's pick a new character. Now where's the uh the ball?
[5212.89s -> 5228.20s]  There's a big ball character. Where are they? Oops. Where's the ball? There you are. Marnie.
[5228.84s -> 5249.14s]  All right Marnie. I'll get you some some different clothes. Perfect. Oh I can only have ah well I'll
[5249.14s -> 5261.75s]  keep it. What do you got? So you're the king. My what a fine chin and a fine beard. Anyway my
[5261.75s -> 5267.51s]  grandson's been at me. He's asking for Katamari Damacy. He's the apple of my eyes so I'd like
[5267.51s -> 5277.69s]  to buy it for him but video games can be bad for you. Right? So I thought I'd play it first to see
[5277.69s -> 5290.47s]  for myself. What do you think? Sure. Video games are bad for you. Marnie you're so tiny as uh tiny
[5290.47s -> 5297.67s]  as ever. Are you working out? Are you boxing? Oh we used to box. We just remember. We did uh
[5297.91s -> 5305.38s]  beat a rabbit once. What? The grandchild? Like we know what that means. Don't interrupt. Can't we
[5305.38s -> 5314.71s]  wallow sometimes? Magnificent figure just like I imagined. Magnificent. Yes grandchildren are sweet.
[5314.71s -> 5320.79s]  Very precious grandchildren. Ah yes yes. All right let's try little rolling with the grandchildren
[5320.79s -> 5334.06s]  too. All right let's roll here another earth house. It's about time to start somewhere new.
[5334.95s -> 5339.67s]  Roll in the fresh air to roll with the wind in your hair. Oh we forgot about the Katamari.
[5339.67s -> 5344.22s]  How about this much time to make this big a Katamari? That's a long time for three meters.
[5344.78s -> 5349.67s]  You can manage that would be nice. All right Marnie it's all yours now.
[5352.39s -> 5363.08s]  Shit I fell off already. I'm gonna restart. What? You're going to roll again? Oh really? How nice.
[5363.08s -> 5371.66s]  You know the rules. Yes all right good luck. I fell off too and you got it. The early game is
[5371.66s -> 5394.07s]  really important. What is going on in this song? It's a bunch of like car traffic.
[5396.39s -> 5407.30s]  Go outside at 20. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
[5413.18s -> 5424.63s]  I think I'm just gonna speed across the whole bottom here.
[5430.30s -> 5451.86s]  Oh I can't get up there yet. Come on. Keep launching over those. It's not bad pace.
[5452.97s -> 5464.01s]  Loading. We can finally talk. When we were little we used to box. Well not just boxing.
[5464.65s -> 5471.37s]  We used to study every kind of material art. Ballet, karate, wrestling. That was very tough.
[5471.37s -> 5480.07s]  We were always crying. Oh the memories. Material art. It's hard to read today.
[5480.07s -> 5500.97s]  Material art. I can go outside but I'm not gonna go out there yet. Hang on for a minute.
[5500.97s -> 5526.34s]  Let me get all the change your papers. Let me get all the remote controls. Yes.
[5529.48s -> 5543.11s]  Get everything. Get the plate too. Get the frog. Get the plate. Everything. I'm going to the fridge
[5543.11s -> 5558.68s]  now. Couldn't get in there before and now I can. Nice. All right good. I'll go outside now. Oh
[5559.64s -> 5564.68s]  I got another prince. I want to get up on the table actually. I got plenty of time to go outside.
[5564.68s -> 5576.04s]  I want to get on the table. Shit. I was in Johnson. Stop getting in the way.
[5587.40s -> 5592.33s]  All right I'm going outside now. I'm getting 100 percent. Oh I got the cat.
[5593.29s -> 5613.11s]  I love when cats just watch tv. All right squid. All right I have seven minutes to get huge.
[5614.07s -> 5659.46s]  This little snowball is in this corner. Go. Not big enough. Once I get to one meter it'll be good.
[5659.46s -> 5675.51s]  I've got to get through everything. Close. Oh we can finally talk. Anyway one day we're in a real
[5675.51s -> 5681.67s]  boat. Boxing boat of course. Our semi-final appointment was a rabbit. Appointment? We just
[5681.67s -> 5687.61s]  missed it. Oh listen. It's because this music playing in my ears. Both ears at the same time.
[5688.57s -> 5693.85s]  And it's kind of it's like louder than me hearing myself talk. I also don't like to hear myself in
[5693.85s -> 5699.94s]  my headphones. So it's kind of a it's just all around. I'm like speech jamming myself.
[5704.87s -> 5708.63s]  Didn't beat the rabbit by the way. You can get to more places if you roll on from here.
[5709.96s -> 5715.96s]  Everyone have a good time. Show that grandson what it's all about. This dude is faded.
[5716.84s -> 5717.64s]  Fine.
[5721.96s -> 5728.38s]  Dude this dude is fucking faded right now. Yeah gosh I can't take this. The sounds in my ears
[5728.38s -> 5738.66s]  right now. I can't talk. I forget how to speak English. I just rolled up a fucking fat joint.
[5738.66s -> 5743.78s]  I don't even know what English is. Why do we have language? Why language is a thing? Who made up
[5743.78s -> 5750.20s]  the first language? Is there a reason why we don't all just talk the same? Why was there more than
[5750.20s -> 5756.47s]  one language ever made? How? What happened? How come we don't just how come we don't communicate
[5756.47s -> 5775.50s]  with each other better? Who made the first sauce? All right I actually gotta I gotta get a little
[5775.50s -> 5805.08s]  bit better here. Gotta be 50 to get over this. Let's go. Move out of the way. Stop. All right five
[5805.08s -> 5827.96s]  minutes. Shit everything's too big. All these TVs are gonna get scooped up here. Oh uh oh.
[5827.96s -> 5847.53s]  I may have come here too early. Go back to the smaller area. That's probably a good idea because
[5847.53s -> 5861.32s]  I'm gonna be in trouble if I don't. Although I might get over here. It's really easy to go from
[5861.32s -> 5892.49s]  two meters to three meters so I think I'm all right. Go go go go go. All right there we are.
[5892.49s -> 5909.77s]  We'll snowball now. Shit. Shit. All right I'm gonna turn down because there's way too many
[5909.77s -> 5922.62s]  people on the road. All right where's the best way for me to go now? This way. TVs. I got it all in
[5922.62s -> 5966.70s]  one go. Come on. Get everybody. Train tracks. Oh okay. The flower beds. I'm getting hit by the
[5966.70s -> 5985.83s]  train over and over again. I can pick the fences up that means we're gonna get through. All right
[5985.83s -> 6011.91s]  I got one minute. Come on get the houses too. Oh what the fuck is all this? Oh my god the screams.
[6012.79s -> 6040.23s]  Did I not get anybody? These things are huge. Get them all. Get me to four. Get to four.
[6045.85s -> 6072.50s]  It's all right. I love this game. 3.6. Do you do aromatherapy? Sometimes I don't know. Sometimes
[6072.50s -> 6080.34s]  you want to smell something like eucalyptus for like five minutes. What's this in our right hand?
[6080.98s -> 6087.06s]  It's a Katamari. Oh 3.6. Isn't that kind of small? No it's not. It's huge.
[6087.78s -> 6093.75s]  It's barely a Katamari. You should make a Katamari big enough to make his grandson sit up.
[6098.44s -> 6116.95s]  3.6 is big. This feels schooly too. It's a complicated Katamari. Average Andy.
[6119.22s -> 6134.74s]  What are you talking about? What should we do with it? Let's put it into the cosmos of course.
[6134.74s -> 6169.02s]  The shopping Pluto. Jesus I'm so fucking noises that are quick and loud to me.
[6169.74s -> 6196.65s]  You've got me fucked up forever. Oh somebody's quests have opened. What are you? I wish we could
[6196.65s -> 6204.06s]  roll together. Just a copycat isn't it? When you make a snowman you roll a snowball to make it bigger.
[6205.21s -> 6210.41s]  The game just copies that. Am I right? It must be. I mean it's the same thing. So let's get back to
[6210.41s -> 6226.65s]  the roots and make a simple snowman. Oh it's snowing. When it snows we think of snowmen.
[6228.09s -> 6233.77s]  Snowmen are cool. Yes they are. Oh it's miney. What do you want?
[6236.89s -> 6244.23s]  What? Copycat? A Katamari Damacy? A copycat? A copycat of the snowman?
[6245.19s -> 6253.82s]  No no that is so wrong. Not a copycat. We respect the snowman. The snowman is the best. The best.
[6254.92s -> 6265.72s]  Roll roll roll that snowman. Let's go hand in hand to winter wonderland. Democracy manifest.
[6266.28s -> 6275.46s]  Let's get started on a snowman. Alrighty how do we do this? See the snowman body here. Marnie is
[6275.54s -> 6283.11s]  going to roll up a head and then roll it onto the body. Very simple. Yes. Yes. That's all it takes
[6283.11s -> 6289.62s]  to make a snowman. Wowee is amazing. Katamari Damacy is so amazing. Let's get back to the basics
[6289.62s -> 6308.18s]  and enjoy ourselves. Joy to the Katamari. We just got to make a snowman. Okay. Do I just have to
[6308.18s -> 6332.74s]  roll up snow? Or do I have to pick anything up? Oh okay. There's no time limit. And this is a great
[6332.74s -> 6375.66s]  song. Can I turn the volume up? Are there any little things I can grab? Or should I just roll
[6375.66s -> 6400.55s]  the snow? Oh can I get the penguins? I'm too afraid to do it right now. Everyone's having so much fun
[6400.55s -> 6427.45s]  over here. Get up here. What did I just pick up? Now I should be able to get. Oh you just rolled up
[6428.33s -> 6435.62s]  something. It was weird and naked. That's la la la.
[6453.94s -> 6462.47s]  I'm gonna get all these because I feel like they're good. I think we're pretty much ready
[6462.47s -> 6472.73s]  right? That's the size of a snowman's head. I think I'm done. If I was making a snowman that's
[6472.73s -> 6479.02s]  what the head would look to see like. Bigger than this? A snowman's head is not that much
[6479.02s -> 6490.10s]  bigger than the body. It's smaller. Make it huge? That wouldn't be accurate.
[6502.79s -> 6511.27s]  But it'd be funny if it's huge. Well all right.
[6526.34s -> 6530.66s]  This is the kind of song. This song just makes me think that everything's gonna be all right.
[6530.66s -> 6565.51s]  You know what I mean? Present. Give me that present Santa. I got it. Present for us? A
[6565.51s -> 6574.07s]  present from a fan? This head is way too big. I think you guys got this wrong. I think it's
[6574.07s -> 6590.78s]  supposed to be normal. It's supposed to be a regular snowman head. I think I can almost
[6590.78s -> 6609.67s]  get this whole thing. Roll up everything dude. They're gonna be pissed off. We're gonna really
[6609.67s -> 6628.86s]  piss them off. We don't care. That was so like quick. We don't care if they're mad.
[6629.74s -> 6667.42s]  What's this penguin selling? Wait I want to take a picture. What are you doing over here?
[6668.06s -> 6677.93s]  I'm just making some delicious food. You want some? No thank you. I've eaten today. Okay come back
[6677.93s -> 6711.06s]  when you're hungry. The sleigh is just moving on its own. That's kind of sad. It's okay you can
[6711.06s -> 6742.09s]  have that. Oh shit it's vaulting me. No go down. Too big. Too big. Too big. No I'm sorry. You have
[6742.09s -> 6749.11s]  to live with this guys. You don't demand I make it as big as possible and then start chanting too
[6749.11s -> 6762.74s]  big. What is going on up here? Can I get up here yet? Come on get up there. What are they eating?
[6762.74s -> 6789.06s]  Are they eating something? Where is that? I get the trees yet? More. More? There's not much left
[6789.06s -> 6822.65s]  to get here. I'm almost at maximum. Bro just create a mass extinction event. Yeah do it. Yeah
[6822.65s -> 6839.80s]  do it. What the hell are you guys doing? I'm too big to get any of that stuff. All right I've gotten
[6839.80s -> 6857.67s]  everybody. I'm not sure I can pick up anything else to get bigger than this. This is it. I can't get
[6857.67s -> 6871.86s]  the igloo yet. I can't climb this either. Use the house as a ramp? The snow is making you bigger.
[6872.50s -> 6890.66s]  Oh I see the one you're talking about. This one here. No not quite. I want to get the igloo but
[6895.10s -> 6908.71s]  oh no still can't climb it. I'm happy with this. This is all right.
[6917.38s -> 6934.63s]  I'm happy with this. I'm happy with it. How's the snowman? It looks awful. Oh yes looks good.
[6935.86s -> 6954.46s]  Good. It's terrible. The snowman's so fun. So much fun isn't it? We just can't win. It's 200
[6954.46s -> 6963.67s]  more fun than a Katamari. What makes this so much fun? What is it? Is it that it's fun or that it
[6963.67s -> 6970.46s]  lets you forget yourself? Well we know the answer but it'll build a character for you to figure it
[6970.46s -> 6981.26s]  out. Wow we got a present. Looks kind of familiar. Oh it's papa. Oh we want you to have it morning.
[6982.39s -> 6987.67s]  Oh it's cousin Lala. What were you doing on earth? Working on a tan in the snow.
[6988.71s -> 6994.50s]  We have no idea what you're talking about. Wow that was so fun. Building a snowman is the best.
[6994.50s -> 6998.50s]  The best fun. I don't know much about games but as long as it's fun who cares.
[6999.30s -> 7004.50s]  It may be a copycat but Katamari Damacy is still fun. Please put the snowman up in the cosmos.
[7005.46s -> 7011.18s]  That's something only Katamari Damacy can do. Yes of course. Of course we're going to do that.
[7011.82s -> 7036.41s]  Star will it be? We wonder. We can't wait to see it. Snowman planet. Wait can't you?
[7044.18s -> 7081.51s]  Do I have this weird memory where you can dance? Can't you dance? There it is. My god what the
[7081.51s -> 7100.94s]  fuck? I can't do it. Why? I am I'm all right. I'm all right. I have I have a very very hard limiter
[7100.94s -> 7106.98s]  on the audio now so don't worry. Nice to meet you your highness. I think Katamari Damacy is fun. I
[7106.98s -> 7114.86s]  play it a lot alone. I've never played the versus mode since I'm alone. Your highness will you be my
[7114.86s -> 7136.01s]  friend? I'm sorry. The answer is yes. My students are all big fans of Katamari Damacy. The king of
[7136.01s -> 7143.30s]  Katamari Damacy around. They're too excited to work. Your highness can I ask you to come see the
[7143.30s -> 7161.69s]  student? Like Carl Jacobs gave subs earlier. When did that happen? Was Carl Jacobs here?
[7163.48s -> 7176.95s]  Wait Carl Jacobs was here? Really? Holy shit. Oh hey what's up? It's like two hours ago? Well
[7177.99s -> 7203.10s]  thanks dude. Students at earth schools? No they're studying Esperanto. We are tri-pupata. We love
[7203.18s -> 7209.90s]  your highness. Love. Hooray done with studying. Perfect time. All righty off to see Bugleberry.
[7209.90s -> 7225.50s]  But this is a school. Very lively. Looks fun. What school is for studying? What kind of studying?
[7225.50s -> 7231.02s]  Rolling? Oh we forgot about the Katamari. You can only play with the students for this long.
[7232.34s -> 7238.58s]  If you can make a Katamari this big they'll have a great time. We know you can do it Marnie. All
[7238.58s -> 7283.05s]  righty. No! I want to restart. I'm good. Get all this shit off the desk. I think I'm... Yep we're
[7283.05s -> 7304.41s]  good. A lot of buckets. Go in a circle. Looks like you can get out onto the hallway. Not yet.
[7307.21s -> 7343.59s]  Not yet. Get everything. Whoa not big enough for any of this. Okay then. I have to go back
[7343.59s -> 7374.34s]  the other way. Yep there we go. Carrot. All right I gotta turn around. What? Stop bouncing me around.
[7375.14s -> 7397.46s]  I'm going back in here. Come on. Oh I got something. Get me on the table. I'm kind of
[7397.46s -> 7409.37s]  glitching through this. Cousin Miso. Get on the desk. Yeah. All right get all that shit.
[7409.37s -> 7430.47s]  Okay. A little too big. There we go. Oh grab the camera. Shit that's a sticker. I can't do it.
[7431.11s -> 7451.58s]  Can I go outside? I can pick the chairs up now. Wait in here. Look at all this shit in here.
[7453.50s -> 7468.04s]  Can I get the desks yet? Get out of the way. Oh shit I'm stuck.
[7468.04s -> 7488.25s]  Can I go in here? What is all this? Oh this is all toilet paper. Shit I have no time.
[7496.09s -> 7523.64s]  No I don't want to go outside. All right go. Get everybody quick. I got 30 seconds. I need to go
[7523.64s -> 7543.16s]  in a different room. Hurry. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. It's too... I'm too big. I
[7543.16s -> 7557.46s]  can't get in here. I can't move. All right. I did okay. Did you make friends with the kids?
[7557.46s -> 7583.83s]  Want to go home now? They are suffering. Is that good enough? Okay. Yes. We counted. We counted
[7583.83s -> 7593.18s]  for the first time. Okay. Okay. To the Katamari in our right hand too. Oh Katamari came out of
[7593.18s -> 7600.86s]  nowhere. Go. Go. Go. Bigger. Make it bigger. Bigger. 2.5. Hey that's small. Nobody can have fun
[7600.86s -> 7610.58s]  like this. Make it bigger and let the good times roll. I'm doing this one again. Oh me so. You were
[7610.58s -> 7616.54s]  wandering around a school. I was going to eat you if you're not careful. Is this the TF2 guy?
[7617.74s -> 7628.87s]  I mean I kind of. Years ago that was correct. Is this the TF2 guy? You know what? That's pretty
[7628.87s -> 7638.26s]  rare nowadays that you're not asking me if I'm the sus guy. You know. All right. Cool. Welcome
[7638.26s -> 7649.50s]  to the stream. What is that I'm feeling? Kind of ripped off is how I feel. All right. All right.
[7649.50s -> 7663.26s]  All right. All right. I'm doing it again. I'm going for five meters. I'm going to get it this time.
[7663.26s -> 7724.58s]  Aren't you the put cigarettes out on my dick guy? Yeah. Oh man. All right. School is great.
[7724.58s -> 7732.78s]  Playing with friends. Confessing your love. Yeah that's me. How did you read that? I don't know.
[7732.78s -> 7738.81s]  Culture Fest. Sports Fest. Graduation. Ah youth. We went to school too of course.
[7739.05s -> 7747.16s]  It was night school. We feel youth was bittersweet. We'd remember from the shock of the bamboo
[7747.16s -> 7759.06s]  sword but the king never looks to the path. I'm going to put on. Hold on. I want the camera. All
[7759.06s -> 7775.99s]  right. You can only have two things on. Camera. Camera and mask. Camera and nose. I think nose.
[7776.63s -> 7804.30s]  Don't you eat bugs? No. No. What? Wait. What? Good day. I'm kind of bored. Oh wait. No. I
[7804.30s -> 7810.47s]  want to do this one. I want to do the school one again. What is the school one over here?
[7811.11s -> 7817.96s]  I have some kids refusing to come back to school because the Katamari was too small.
[7818.98s -> 7825.26s]  I'll. All right. I'm going to do this one again. I think you'd like Tears of the Kingdom if you
[7825.26s -> 7841.11s]  played on stream. Would I like it? What are you going to do the next smite tutorial? I'm working
[7841.11s -> 7854.97s]  on one now. Smite's still going strong and are there more cartoon characters than gods in the
[7854.97s -> 7867.05s]  game now? Wait. I just remember there was there was like a Ninja Turtles crossover and I was like,
[7867.05s -> 7876.52s]  oh okay. The Ninja Turtles are in Smite now. They added a lot of just random shit. Whatever.
[7877.32s -> 7883.62s]  I'm going to play as like Donatello. That's pretty cool. All right. So I have to pick up.
[7886.01s -> 7937.66s]  This is a different mission. What is going on in here? This is kind of loud in here. Oh I got a
[7937.66s -> 7980.44s]  new cousin. Huey. Not yet. One person in here? Somebody said, dude, open up multiple streams to
[7980.44s -> 8013.40s]  get sound echo? Why? That probably would be annoying to listen to. Only one more person.
[8013.40s -> 8023.77s]  Where are they? One more? This is two minutes, man. Come on. Where's the last person?
[8023.77s -> 8049.77s]  Shit. Oh there you are. Time to get out of school. Bye now. Under 220? That's probably better.
[8050.57s -> 8070.57s]  I have this open on five tabs. This sounds insane. Okay. Uh huh. It's hard to judge.
[8070.57s -> 8082.49s]  You can get the students home from school much faster. Yeah. 229. That's really good. Hey it's
[8082.49s -> 8088.01s]  Huey. What were you doing on earth? You were playing with kids. That's a good thing. Oh it
[8088.01s -> 8098.33s]  feels seeding-ish or rather children-y. Here we go. Okay. None of the students would leave the
[8098.33s -> 8103.93s]  school for a while. I think they wanted to play with your highness a little longer. So it's not
[8103.93s -> 8109.77s]  as though you were just slow. It's fine to have a dawdling Katamari now and again. I'd like you to
[8109.77s -> 8130.07s]  have this cut. Was it bad still? Two minutes and 29 seconds? Hey look it's a backpack. I used to
[8130.07s -> 8155.00s]  have one like that. Cool. Watch your blinds. I'd like to win. Okay. Nice to meet you. As you can see
[8155.00s -> 8159.88s]  I'm pretty small but I'm a sumo wrestler. I'm so small that I can't win very often. I thought
[8159.88s -> 8166.17s]  playing Katamari Damacy would make me bigger but it didn't. My oyakata got mad and told me to stop
[8166.17s -> 8171.93s]  playing video games. Anyway I thought it through and I want to study with your highness. I want
[8171.93s -> 8186.47s]  to be stronger. Please say yes. What are you guys doing? I just looked over at the dashboard for
[8186.47s -> 8192.01s]  the first time in like an hour or two. The stream went up like 2,000 viewers because you guys are
[8192.01s -> 8199.83s]  opening a fucking shitload of tabs. Just in the last 20 minutes I think the stream has gone up by
[8199.83s -> 8211.21s]  like a thousand or two thousand viewers. How many of you are actually doing this? Inflating the
[8211.21s -> 8220.60s]  numbers yeah. All right so what are we gonna do? You want to be strong for what? Here's the thing
[8220.60s -> 8233.70s]  about strength. You have to work. Don't ask for it. I want to be like you. We see now. Yes we absolutely
[8233.70s -> 8240.90s]  get it. We get it. All righty let's get stronger. I keep forgetting to turn the music up and the
[8240.90s -> 8247.98s]  sounds down. We're getting fired up. The battle is starting. Today's opponent is ready and standing by.
[8248.70s -> 8263.90s]  Okay. He seems pretty strong but still. Give it your best shot. Give it all you got. How about
[8263.90s -> 8271.90s]  this much time to decide the bout? Viso make sure you roll our fan firm and steady. As for you our
[8271.90s -> 8284.02s]  fan eat everything inside and grow nice and big. All righty we wish you a good fight. Okay I need
[8284.02s -> 8303.74s]  to eat food. Is he saying? I just lost everything I just picked up. All right let's get some cabbage.
[8305.40s -> 8317.35s]  I didn't get it yet. Oh cookies.
[8320.74s -> 8338.63s]  I love delicious cookies. A lot right here. Give me the fish.
[8346.66s -> 8354.50s]  I missed every single object but honestly every single one. That was impressive how bad that was.
[8356.26s -> 8373.30s]  There we go. Can't get the chicken and the turkey.
[8381.90s -> 8387.90s]  I want that cart.
[8395.51s -> 8405.19s]  Oh my god look at those raining mushrooms. Not big enough.
[8417.61s -> 8423.86s]  Keep going in here. All right I don't want to get up there yet. Not quite ready.
[8432.47s -> 8439.51s]  How big should I be before I try it?
[8449.75s -> 8465.05s]  Shit can't get watermelons in either. I think I can get yep.
[8467.77s -> 8482.89s]  A fig mom. Dude your view count is fucked up now.
[8494.49s -> 8498.63s]  Hurry up. Lot of stuff over here.
[8507.91s -> 8514.58s]  All right with one one minute I'm gonna go back.
[8532.94s -> 8535.74s]  All right where's this? Where is it? Right here. Not yet.
[8546.15s -> 8556.06s]  Oh my god look at all this.
[8556.06s -> 8587.24s]  Let's go. You ate well and rolled well and now you're pretty strong.
[8587.24s -> 8590.94s]  Yes all righty let's go. That wasn't bad 234.
[8598.22s -> 8602.42s]  I'm gonna go to sleep. Where is it in the world for you right now?
[8605.38s -> 8609.02s]  We're starting to figure it out. What the most powerful thing in the world is.
[8609.66s -> 8616.23s]  Not missiles or guns. It's the heart in all of us we think. Of course Subo is important too.
[8617.64s -> 8624.36s]  Supari Moridashi it's the best. Oh did you happen to win? Microwe wrestler man did you
[8624.36s -> 8630.47s]  finally get to win? And did you happen to win by roll up? Super rolling up his school.
[8631.35s -> 8635.51s]  You ate hard and rolled hard? Yes we think you worked very hard. Congratulations on your victory.
[8638.55s -> 8644.15s]  How's it Nick? What were you doing on earth? An eating contest? I was food as usual.
[8644.71s -> 8649.50s]  Much obliged your highness I finally won. I was up against someone fairly strong but I managed to
[8649.50s -> 8655.10s]  win by roll up. I'll apply myself and become stronger. Work harder so I can beat an poseki.
[8655.90s -> 8660.38s]  Oh it's almost time for practice. I'll leave. All right we got a happy customer.
[8661.34s -> 8686.68s]  Welcome to the cosmos. Good Yokozuna win planet. Remember this game is freaking goofy.
[8687.72s -> 8695.69s]  Yeah I mean it's what you might say this game is wonderful. A very wonderful game.
[8699.43s -> 8703.02s]  Candy pop presents freaking goofy.
[8707.94s -> 8712.57s]  What am I going to do about dinner? His room is sort of cleaned I guess.
[8712.57s -> 8715.21s]  But it took a while didn't it? He'll be in college before you finish.
[8717.83s -> 8721.51s]  You know parents are busy people you have to clean up this bastard. All right we'll try this
[8721.51s -> 8727.54s]  bastard. You want to order a pizza tonight? Um if you want a pizza get one.
[8730.66s -> 8747.80s]  All right I'm gonna try doing this one again. Okay a hundred things in the room. Go.
[8755.83s -> 8757.83s]  Two okay I get under three minutes.
[8757.83s -> 8803.35s]  How's my pace so far? Better? He said eh. Damn it too small.
[8811.18s -> 8822.26s]  I got plenty of time. I'm big enough to get this.
[8823.06s -> 8829.62s]  Not yet.
[8842.02s -> 8862.12s]  Seven items left. I'm too big to fit through here. Two one zero up. Where is it?
[8865.34s -> 8881.24s]  Where is it? Where's the last item? Where's the last item? Get it. It's right here roll over it.
[8881.24s -> 8899.16s]  All right that was almost a full minute quicker. I can do definitely better than that. I could
[8899.16s -> 8907.74s]  probably do better than that. We'll see if it's good though. It's a miniature universe of my
[8907.74s -> 8913.83s]  kid's room sparkling with cosmic order. Took two minutes and 12 seconds. Are you sure you can't be
[8913.83s -> 8921.48s]  more efficient? Shit okay it's sort of cleaned up. Of course it's cleaned up but it's not so
[8921.48s -> 8927.24s]  different from what I usually do myself. I guess this is about it. It's only Katamari Demasi after
[8927.24s -> 8940.22s]  all. This Katamari is kind of in the way. It's gotta be under two minutes. Planet or planet dust?
[8940.70s -> 8960.71s]  Well let's replace this one. Better. The mission is hard. This game is just as challenging as it
[8960.71s -> 8967.75s]  needs to be because you can just roll around and have fun or you can try to do the very very
[8967.75s -> 8975.48s]  intricate challenges. What do you got? So you're the king. It's nice to meet you. I'm almost 89
[8975.48s -> 8981.74s]  years old. I'm still young at heart. My perspective is still fresh but I can't seem to find anything
[8981.74s -> 8995.90s]  fun. A friend told me that Katamari Demasi was fun. Is it true? Yes it is. Miso's hair is boring
[8995.90s -> 9004.46s]  so not fun. You know there are options don't you? The afro, mohawk, pompadour. Oh we just remembered
[9004.46s -> 9011.64s]  we had a pompadour. We were the sharpest of the sharp. Those were the days. But excitement? You
[9011.72s -> 9019.37s]  want excitement? Talking about a pompadour yes? Oh it's far too late now. Your highness's avant-garde.
[9025.62s -> 9037.43s]  All righty so starting now let's roll it vanguard style. Okay here we go. Are you winning Jeremy?
[9038.15s -> 9049.02s]  I think so. It's so sunny. It's a nice day. It's hiking time. Let's get going. Oh we forgot about
[9049.02s -> 9055.02s]  the Katamari. How about this much time to make this big? 12 minutes for 12 meters. I can do that.
[9057.56s -> 9063.24s]  Alright this one's gonna be good. What I'm going for. This is gonna be a real one. This song is
[9063.24s -> 9069.43s]  phenomenal by the way. And I didn't turn the music up again. Fucking idiot. This is arguably like
[9069.43s -> 9073.91s]  one of the better songs in the whole game. No not this one. I lied. No it is this one.
[9075.19s -> 9078.07s]  I think I'm making that up. I think it's this one. I think I'm lying.
[9078.07s -> 9116.20s]  Fine. Bananas. Pawn. Pigs. This reminds me of like tune music. I feel like I'm gonna I'm walking
[9116.20s -> 9141.78s]  around like toon town. Because I'm in an amusement park. I've got them all. 50 not quite. I'm not
[9141.78s -> 9169.94s]  going there yet. I can't pick up the bananas? These things are worth picking up.
[9171.06s -> 9178.95s]  I still have 11 minutes. I'm good. Alright let's go this way.
[9193.05s -> 9215.91s]  I think that was fairly efficient. Give me that upgrade. There it is. Loading. And oh we can talk.
[9215.91s -> 9220.71s]  Where were we? Oh yes we used to have a pompadour. It's a very cool look. Sort of sticks out over
[9220.71s -> 9225.11s]  your forehead. But that can be a problem yes. If you don't do it well it gets saggy. Well it's
[9225.11s -> 9231.40s]  mostly about the attitude. That's what it comes down to. You can get to more places if you roll
[9231.40s -> 9246.92s]  from here. Get more rebellious. More glamorous. Not going there yet. Get all this other shit.
[9247.88s -> 9280.14s]  I'm going back in here. Alright go.
[9297.72s -> 9301.32s]  Oh I'm in line at a ride at a theme park.
[9301.32s -> 9337.02s]  I gotta come back down this road. There's so much shit here. 8 minutes.
[9345.90s -> 9356.63s]  Shit. Okay time to snowball. I got lots of time to snowball too.
[9360.30s -> 9383.94s]  Really? Still can't get the umbrellas. I need the big soups. Get up on there. What?
[9392.38s -> 9416.82s]  Get out of here. It's a gun. Flowers. Oh shit. It's not big enough.
[9424.92s -> 9443.19s]  You roll like my grandma. That's fine. We can all play Katamari differently. Alright now I'm
[9443.19s -> 9447.42s]  gonna go up. I'm gonna get this is gonna be I'm gonna suck up all this right now.
[9448.46s -> 9467.51s]  That's this. What's up everybody? All these chairs are gonna be so much space. Nice.
[9468.07s -> 9505.22s]  Nice. Three meters? Not quite. Okay I gotta go back out on the street. Oh I can't get that.
[9509.94s -> 9517.30s]  Have I got the fence yet? I don't think so.
[9531.78s -> 9540.76s]  We can finally talk. We don't like loading. Anyway we can't manage a pompadour anymore. No.
[9542.15s -> 9545.35s]  We can't handle a hairstyle that draws so much attention.
[9545.99s -> 9551.91s]  Shy and retiring by disposition. Yes. Because we were young, youth can be very embarrassing,
[9551.91s -> 9565.88s]  but it's whatever. You can get more places over there. Can I get the horses? Can I get
[9565.88s -> 9573.70s]  right? Alright I got a lot of time but it's not gonna fix anything here. I gotta go down every
[9573.70s -> 9594.54s]  road. Every street. Yep. I'll get those tables later. I want to once you can start picking fences
[9594.54s -> 9609.19s]  up. That's when it's all over. Fences, cars, that's when you can start to really just kind of go
[9609.91s -> 9638.71s]  crazy with it. Alright I'm going back this way. Get it all. Get it all. These things are pretty
[9638.71s -> 9660.34s]  big. I want to get them all. That too. Alright what about down here? I'll turn around. There it is.
[9666.20s -> 9687.05s]  Shit I gotta get bigger. Come on hurry. Hold on to this section I haven't been to. Okay
[9687.69s -> 9698.20s]  give me this whole fucking structure. Anymore can I pick all the houses up now?
[9712.95s -> 9724.86s]  Let's get her. I gotta roll over here back to where I was. Cars are very good right now.
[9725.66s -> 9754.79s]  Trees are good right now. Let's go hurry. Alright I gotta get to a different spot.
[9755.59s -> 9783.58s]  I gotta go back up to the town and up this way. Hurry. Hurry. I'm not gonna make it. Let's go.
[9794.94s -> 9823.82s]  More houses. More houses. 18. These are all so big. Just get these.
[9830.49s -> 9848.36s]  Okay I'm good. I'm good. Could have been 20 but it's alright. Did I get a present?
[9849.00s -> 9860.15s]  No it's right there. Shit. Imagine your house gets sucked up by a meatball.
[9861.03s -> 9872.54s]  So many memories. Oh what's this? It's a tatamari. Once we took a good look it seems kind of half
[9872.54s -> 9878.70s]  big. Besides the appearance 18.8 is just mediocre. Katamari that breaks on through.
[9878.70s -> 9888.47s]  That's what we want to see. This feels plant-ish. That was a little boring. It's over. That's the
[9888.47s -> 9893.19s]  end. Don't you have to make the thing bigger for the game to be fun? I don't need a boring
[9893.19s -> 9907.94s]  katamari here your highness. You can have it. Broke Jupiter. That's kind of exciting. It's
[9907.94s -> 9918.41s]  gonna be in space. My grandma took an edible and is tripping watching your screen. She's freaking
[9918.41s -> 9958.01s]  out. That's a fake story but alright. What the hell? What happens to the people you roll up? Do
[9958.01s -> 9998.14s]  they die when they go to space? No. No they don't. There we go. I'm gonna play as as Lala.
[9998.14s -> 10006.22s]  Alright what are the new quests? Is this a versus or what is this actually?
[10006.22s -> 10018.18s]  Is this actually like a two-player thing? We so want a pet. Something to soothe our weary heart.
[10019.50s -> 10029.69s]  Dearest. What kind of pet should it be? What a friend? What are we talking about pets here?
[10032.07s -> 10038.17s]  An adorable pet to play adorable games with. Everything about you is amazing.
[10041.05s -> 10049.26s]  Everything. Friends are so very important. We are everyone's beloved superstar so we can't be a
[10049.26s -> 10060.66s]  friend to just one person. Let's get rolling and find some friends. What are you doing the shock
[10060.66s -> 10069.93s]  college screen? I'm not doing. Alright why did I even read that out loud? Okay. Mother nature's
[10069.93s -> 10079.24s]  very own zoo. Too long. It barely fits. Since our fan probably wants friends fast. How about this
[10079.24s -> 10086.58s]  much time to roll as many friends into a Katamari as you can. We know you can do it. Lala. Alrighty
[10086.58s -> 10098.47s]  it doesn't sound right if I say it that way. Alright friends. What counts as a friend? Oh this
[10098.47s -> 10124.89s]  is the woofing and the meowing one. I love this one. I love this song. That's animals?
[10125.61s -> 10210.30s]  More friends. Is it people too? A lot over here. Can you get the rabbit? Bunny? Okay I'm stuck.
[10210.30s -> 10229.69s]  I definitely can't get the tigers right now. Can you get the pigs? Prime that please.
[10230.57s -> 10277.53s]  Oh look at all this. Get me in here. Shit. Can you get all those flamingos? Good. I'll come back
[10277.53s -> 10304.66s]  here later. What's considered a good amount of friends here? 100? 200? Alright I think I
[10304.66s -> 10342.17s]  can get the tigers now. A lot here. Let's go. That. I hear that everywhere. I think I can go for 200.
[10344.78s -> 10353.67s]  Oh I got a present. These don't count as friends but they make me bigger.
[10354.47s -> 10372.50s]  Can't pick these up yet. Oh yes I can. Can I get the camels? Yeah let's go.
[10385.46s -> 10421.34s]  So many over here. Elephant? Nope. I can't get the giraffes either. Stop walking. What are your
[10421.34s -> 10432.15s]  thoughts on Tom Brady? Oh Tom Brady? Who's fucking football? I fucking love that. Oh you mean fucking
[10432.15s -> 10445.88s]  Hall of Fame Tom Brady? Most passing yards of any fucking quarterback ever? You don't know
[10445.88s -> 10472.78s]  shit about football. Oh cousin. This is getting kind of out of hand here. I have not watched a
[10472.78s -> 10495.26s]  full game of the Patriots since I was probably 20? Maybe like 25? I don't know. Alright anything
[10495.26s -> 10506.60s]  else I'm missing here? Climb this. We're going all the way up. We're going all the way up. Can I get
[10506.60s -> 10535.29s]  the big? Can I get them? Yes. I got 200 plus. I got quite a lot. Okay am I missing anything?
[10535.29s -> 10559.53s]  There's a bunch over here still. Getting caught on shit. I need 250. Come on. Come on 247. I need 250.
[10561.37s -> 10598.55s]  250. Oh you piece of shit. Come here. Yes we're good. Brady. Come on Brady. Why did you plus two
[10598.55s -> 10607.27s]  that? I didn't even do anything. Why are you plus twoing this? I just said Brady. Tom Brady.
[10608.07s -> 10616.98s]  Is it? I didn't do anything else. I put like the funny accent on right? That's right.
[10623.51s -> 10633.96s]  Alright fabulous 250 friends. That's good. We could have rolled up more friends.
[10634.60s -> 10642.07s]  Oh with second cousin beyond. What were you doing on earth? Slumming it somewhere up high.
[10643.03s -> 10652.17s]  We have no idea what we're talking about. You think the subtle touch of a Chinese zodiac is
[10652.17s -> 10657.70s]  the signature here? Oh wow so many. This is amazing. Katamari Damacy is amazing. So many.
[10657.70s -> 10663.62s]  I'm really grateful. Now all that's left is your highness to persuade. Will you be my best friend
[10663.62s -> 10671.67s]  in exchange for this Katamari? Oh really? You're giving it to us? Fabulous. We are so pleased.
[10672.47s -> 10698.22s]  The evolution planet. Now that you mention it there weren't any. Hmm swans. You know swans?
[10699.11s -> 10705.11s]  We think we remember seeing swans at the zoo. Wait was it swans? We're not sure. We'd remember
[10705.11s -> 10717.51s]  from the shock of the bamboo sword. There is no need. Hey where are you? You're a lot bigger in
[10717.51s -> 10722.90s]  person. I used to watch Katamari Damacy when I was still in my mom's. What did that say? I used to
[10722.90s -> 10729.13s]  float in there and think you roll up stuff and get bigger, crash and get smaller. Kind of like
[10729.13s -> 10740.28s]  life. That's what I thought. But sometimes there's not a lot to roll up right? There are times like
[10740.28s -> 10752.94s]  that. So how about trying to get as big as possible with just a few things? I thought you
[10752.94s -> 10760.49s]  were reading chat for a second? No. We're bored of Katamari Damacy. So boring just to roll.
[10761.45s -> 10769.98s]  Monsters, dungeons, la la la. Are we there yet? Huh? What? Going to use a new rule to roll?
[10770.86s -> 10775.69s]  Are you sure this is fun? You're my role model your highness.
[10778.81s -> 10785.48s]  Roll model? Yes it must be fun then. Fun as a hundred of the usual Katamari's put together.
[10786.04s -> 10789.99s]  Probably more fun than fighting monsters. Hurry up let's get rolling.
[10798.81s -> 10808.78s]  Roll according to a rule. The rule here is make as big a Katamari as possible using a limited
[10808.78s -> 10814.94s]  number of objects. A thoughtful kind of rolling. Yes we can't possibly do it. We would break this
[10814.94s -> 10822.54s]  rule left and right. But we're sure that you can do it la la la. All right so what do I need to get?
[10824.95s -> 10835.24s]  What am I picking up here? What am I picking up? Remaining just 50 objects. That's it.
[10861.80s -> 10871.77s]  No it needs to be big objects. I'm not big enough to pick up the big stuff.
[10884.31s -> 10892.98s]  You can't read. Wait what? I don't understand. Your Katamari is already huge.
[10898.87s -> 10918.09s]  I don't want to pick up the fucking buoy. Get as big as possible with only 50 objects. These things
[10918.09s -> 10941.11s]  are pretty big. Let's go look around. One more. These things are kind of big. That boat's pretty
[10941.11s -> 10986.62s]  big. These are kind of big. Can't get the alligators. Okay the statue's big. All right now
[10986.62s -> 11011.86s]  don't touch anything. Get huge stuff now. This is big. Yep. Alligator. Oh no I didn't want to pick
[11011.86s -> 11027.77s]  up an anteater. Don't pick those up either. Fence. All right fences are huge. These boats are big.
[11029.32s -> 11048.39s]  No. Damn it. Get off me. All right let me get to five and I'll be happy. Shit. It's all right.
[11050.94s -> 11070.87s]  It's all right. Could have been better. Can you please play reader rabbit learn to read with
[11070.87s -> 11089.19s]  phonics first and second grade? Yeah. Um yeah. Is that good enough? Is that small or big? We don't
[11089.19s -> 11093.51s]  get that part. Is this a Katamari or something else? That's another thing we're not sure about.
[11094.15s -> 11098.89s]  Now we have to hold fast. Make it much bigger. Something's not right. This sort of thing
[11099.53s -> 11104.01s]  is sort of different from what I was thinking. Roll it right please. I was born to do this you
[11104.01s -> 11121.30s]  know. Your highness can have this thing. Oh it's amazing. You really are amazing. Your voice is
[11121.30s -> 11156.39s]  extra crispy today. Thank you. It means a lot. I really appreciate it. I'm not going to resub to
[11156.39s -> 11165.77s]  you because you're not playing Zelda. Here's what I want you to do. Find a streamer that you like
[11165.77s -> 11171.85s]  that's playing Zelda and I want you to give your sub to that streamer. If you're doing the thing
[11171.85s -> 11176.89s]  that you want to see them do and you can be like holy shit this person's playing. This person is
[11176.89s -> 11203.18s]  playing Zelda and it gives me such joy. Okay let's go. Good day help the paper cranes. I don't know
[11203.18s -> 11209.88s]  how Katamari demires it but my friend loves it. See this friend she's sick now and not in school.
[11210.52s -> 11216.41s]  I want her to get better soon so we're making a thousand something but the cranes got scattered
[11216.97s -> 11220.57s]  by the wind and it's a mess. Your highness can you help us collect the cranes for my friend?
[11222.54s -> 11240.73s]  Absolutely. Can you do a Daxter impression from Jack and Jack and Daxter? Don't tell me which one.
[11240.73s -> 11248.09s]  Okay Jack and Dexter is don't tell me if I'm wrong or not because there's a couple games with this
[11248.09s -> 11255.51s]  this plays out. Jack and Dexter is the one where it's like a it's like a weasel and a
[11257.03s -> 11268.28s]  young man with like big hair right? So Jack and Dexter are but I don't know who is who.
[11270.12s -> 11280.65s]  Is Dexter the weasel character or is Dexter the character you play with? Dexter is the
[11280.65s -> 11286.58s]  Daxter. Daxter is the weasel. Okay you want me to do an impression of this character.
[11290.54s -> 11294.06s]  I don't know what this character sounds like but I'm gonna give it a shot. Can you give me a line
[11294.06s -> 11300.63s]  to read? I feel like I know what this person sounds like but I don't give me a line. A line
[11300.63s -> 11303.85s]  from the game. Oh that that's a good one.
[11310.89s -> 11335.82s]  All right give me another one. How about this line? I'm Daxter from Jack and Daxter. That's
[11335.82s -> 11344.76s]  not what happens. Give me a line if you want me to do an impression. Give me a line. Give me a line.
[11347.00s -> 11362.84s]  You guys want it so bad. Give me a line. Whoa Morty I turned myself into a Daxter Morty.
[11363.80s -> 11384.63s]  Okay give me a give me a real line. He goes ah I'm Daxter but no he doesn't. None of these lines.
[11384.63s -> 11396.58s]  Okay this one's real. So there I was toe to toe with five of the nastiest metal heads you ever
[11396.58s -> 11402.90s]  saw. Slime oozing from monstrous jaws. Feet sharper than the daggers. Slowly all ten of them
[11402.90s -> 11408.74s]  surrounded me Jerry. Do I surrender? No. I summon my highly trained killer instincts and pounce.
[11409.38s -> 11418.23s]  Ha yeah and when the dust is cleared there were 20 less metal heads in the world. Is it close?
[11418.87s -> 11438.98s]  That was Bernie Sanders. You just put it why do you put Bernie inflection on everything?
[11438.98s -> 11442.02s]  All right wait wait this actually quotes here. Hold on let me hear some of these.
[11442.66s -> 11448.89s]  Let me turn this down for one second. See I don't I have no idea what this person sounds like. Hold
[11448.89s -> 11462.62s]  on. Okay. Rocks when turned over reveal their dark underbelly in the great struggle of good
[11462.62s -> 11473.40s]  versus okay. I swear that's the last time I ever ever touch any stupid precursor crap.
[11478.82s -> 11485.30s]  I mean that was pretty close. It will be your downfall these. That was excuse me that was
[11485.30s -> 11496.52s]  really fucking close. I did that was actually pretty close. Freaks will not save us. Oh yeah
[11497.16s -> 11505.13s]  the road map to Jack. Nice going little buddy. Yes it was. Especially when he was screaming.
[11505.13s -> 11521.58s]  Let's see what's on the tube tonight. Seen it. Rerun. Boring. Sorry ladies. Whoa sorry Jerry.
[11521.58s -> 11529.38s]  Right I had it right. For somebody that has no idea what this character sounded like it was
[11529.38s -> 11543.61s]  actually pretty close. And you know what? F you if you don't think so. Okay let's keep playing.
[11548.63s -> 11563.40s]  Bully. He's a bully. He's a bully. I think it was pretty good. Okay can you? There we are.
[11571.51s -> 11576.20s]  All right just love peace and a few other guys. Oh we forgot about the Katamari. You have this
[11576.20s -> 11587.91s]  much time to roll up lots and lots of paper cranes. Thousand cranes to grant a wish. Okay so I
[11587.91s -> 11597.21s]  gotta get to a thousand. Easy enough. We know you can do it. La la la. Let's go. All right I turned
[11597.21s -> 11601.13s]  it up. I turned it up everybody. I know a lot of people are asking me to turn it up so it's turned
[11601.13s -> 11659.38s]  up. It's not a whole lot of time. The chicken just fucking destroyed me. What was your favorite
[11659.46s -> 11688.70s]  subject in math? Uh logic. I'm not kidding. The redditor comment. No it's not. That's not math.
[11688.70s -> 11707.74s]  That's logic. How do I? There's not a thousand paper cranes in here. Is there another? Is there an exit?
[11707.74s -> 11716.17s]  Okay there is. Okay there's quite a lot in here actually.
[11716.17s -> 11756.50s]  Crispy voice today. Crispy. It had to be crispy. All right. Crispy onions.
[11757.46s -> 11760.18s]  You happy you had the onions? Are you glad you glad you had the onions?
[11761.54s -> 11772.87s]  You happy you had the onions? Don't blame this on me. It had to be crispy. Crispy onions. They have to
[11772.87s -> 11802.10s]  be crispy. What's that from? Mods. Oh shit I fucking forgot. Okay I gotta get like some steam
[11802.10s -> 11807.54s]  gift cards. Holy shit I was about to play the game show bullshit again and I forgot that I haven't
[11807.54s -> 11831.29s]  even given the first fucking people their things. Oh shit. Wait you scammed him. I just completely
[11831.29s -> 11842.98s]  forgot. All right don't worry I'll take care of this. Can you please say it was a bad day?
[11843.54s -> 11865.67s]  Hold on I don't want to lose. Oh this is the room to do it in. I'm gonna get so close. It's gonna be so sad.
[11885.26s -> 11892.89s]  Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
[11898.66s -> 11905.99s]  Oh I didn't do it. I'm an underachiever. Yeah it's from curvy enthusiasm. They get behind the slow
[11905.99s -> 11913.94s]  golfer because Larry's cousin they they really want to get in front of the slow golfer but
[11914.50s -> 11919.46s]  Larry's cousin orders crispy onions with his eggs which is gonna take extra time which Larry's like
[11919.46s -> 11944.57s]  you fucking idiot. We gotta get in front of the slow golfer. The guy the guy 90% that's not bad.
[11944.57s -> 11957.43s]  Won't help get anyone out of the hospital sooner. I need to get a hundred percent.
[11959.08s -> 11976.46s]  Opio. Opio. Up to the cosmos. What about Clank from Ratchet and Clank?
[11977.18s -> 11997.35s]  Okay Clank. Clank is a robot right so I will probably have a probably have a robotic voice
[11998.07s -> 12009.08s]  but are we talking c3po level of like a robot and I talk very eloquently or are we talking
[12011.00s -> 12014.28s]  like caveman style robot where I have five words I say.
[12016.15s -> 12024.31s]  Hmm hold on this is important. What are you linking me here?
[12058.73s -> 12065.30s]  Are you happy on the onions? Oh that's so fucking funny. That show is so good.
[12069.30s -> 12078.15s]  I'm sorry I just laughed really loud in your ear but somebody said I sounded like Beavis and
[12078.15s -> 12084.46s]  Butt-head. I sounded like Butt-head from Beavis and Butt-head. Clip it I want to hear it. You
[12084.46s -> 12103.18s]  sounded like Butt-head. Shut up. Link it. It was a great laugh was it. I need to hear it. It was the
[12104.30s -> 12120.81s]  you have an attitude today. Bro somebody just said I sound like Butt-head. That is an attack
[12120.81s -> 12138.92s]  all right that's an attack. I'm going on the defensive. That wasn't that
[12146.44s -> 12147.88s]  not even that close.
[12158.54s -> 12164.46s]  I'll tell you one of my most my favorite episode from Beavis and Butt-head is when
[12166.86s -> 12174.98s]  Beavis sits down in one of those automatic blood pressure machines and just fucking freaks out.
[12175.78s -> 12186.50s]  You guys remember those things? It's like Butt-head squeezing my arm.
[12188.02s -> 12195.94s]  Butt-head get it off me. You look stupid. He's like he's fucking and I think it like he gets like hurt.
[12197.77s -> 12200.65s]  He has a fucking meltdown sitting down in that thing.
[12209.72s -> 12212.76s]  You did the clank voice perfectly. I did? Oh that's good.
[12213.48s -> 12222.92s]  Oh we do honey or no I want to do opio. I need more presents too. I'm really lacking in the present
[12222.92s -> 12241.34s]  department. All right let's go here. I want to roll up a car. What I want to roll up is a car.
[12248.36s -> 12253.82s]  I tried myself during a race but couldn't roll them up. Give me a chance please.
[12254.54s -> 12259.58s]  Do a master shake impression. I think I could probably do a good one and I think I did do a
[12259.58s -> 12270.38s]  good one. People said it was a bad one and I was really disappointed. You've got some real
[12270.38s -> 12282.92s]  corn holio energy today. He used to like he used to put his shirt oh my god. He would make um okay
[12283.48s -> 12285.32s]  corn holio used to sit there and be like
[12288.20s -> 12292.44s]  he would make Popeye noises. You know Popeye? Popeye would be like
[12295.48s -> 12309.11s]  I need TV. It's so childish but it's fucking funny. I don't even care.
[12311.16s -> 12342.18s]  I'm obsessed with yeah uh Holly's been watching King of the Hill. That's a great show too. Mike
[12342.18s -> 12353.48s]  Judge does a lot of great work. Everyone including the Katamari will go at the same time.
[12354.28s -> 12358.84s]  Roll up cars to your heart's content. Let's see how many. Okay so I get six minutes to roll up
[12358.84s -> 12413.18s]  a bunch of cars. Five meters. Cars. Okay let's go. Let's start. Go! Okay got one.
[12415.98s -> 12446.25s]  Oh this one that goes oh the Katamari rolls around on its own. Why? It's a racetrack.
[12447.05s -> 12476.81s]  Not big enough. Oh look at these Super Mario pipes. Whoa it is moving on its own. It wasn't
[12476.81s -> 12501.91s]  kidding. It's actually moving on its own. Are these frogs in the race? I almost have them all almost.
[12502.71s -> 12526.57s]  Shit. Come here. All right I'm definitely big enough now. One more and I'll get them all.
[12527.45s -> 12563.10s]  Come on. What's happening? Goodness. All right there's like five people left. That one,
[12563.10s -> 12597.13s]  that one, that one. Still not big enough for the actual race cars. Three minutes. So close. There
[12597.13s -> 12607.27s]  we go. Get the rest of the cars and I'm gonna start picking up everything else. Really? Not
[12607.27s -> 12634.10s]  big enough? What'd I get? Go backwards? Kind of moving for me. Oh hurry up. There it is. All
[12634.10s -> 12657.51s]  right. Finally. I can get the rest of the cars. Where's that present? Is there a present? There's
[12657.51s -> 12683.08s]  a present? On the big boat? Big boat. Where's the big boat? Where's the big boat? Big boat.
[12683.08s -> 12707.78s]  Let's see. Big boat. Big, that big boat. Did I get all the cars? I think I got them all. Yeah I got
[12707.78s -> 12730.60s]  all the cars. We're good. We get to like 10. These things are huge. No, no bounce. Sorry.
[12731.16s -> 12753.70s]  It's pretty fun. It was pretty fun. Everyone won the race. Cars they're pretty fast. Of course
[12753.70s -> 12760.74s]  we are faster. If we fly we are even faster. Oh what's this Katamari doing here? What is this
[12760.74s -> 12770.12s]  clunker? It's a three cc engine. Seven cc. Let's work on getting it bigger. At least 60,000.
[12770.12s -> 12779.69s]  60 million. Sorry. That's the level of Katamari we can expect. Wow. We got a horsey as a present.
[12779.69s -> 12790.36s]  Ooh. It's kind of charming but hopefully oh you can have it. I'm a fan. Appreciate it. Hey what the
[12790.36s -> 12796.52s]  this isn't as fun as car racing. This sure ain't as exciting as car racing. Katamari Demasi was
[12796.52s -> 12819.96s]  more fun before. Let down. You can have this thing your highness. Beat the record. All right
[12819.96s -> 12828.86s]  we're gonna go put the music up and the sound down again. Let's swim in the ocean. Right at
[12828.86s -> 12841.45s]  the beach we used to uh blue sea, white sand, seagulls, umbrellas, starfish, crabs, seashells,
[12841.45s -> 12852.41s]  tires. Tires. I remember from the shock of ambusade that we have no interest in tires.
[12853.69s -> 12862.89s]  No I didn't fucking do it. Quiet. I didn't say it. You all thought it was gonna happen. How dare you
[12862.89s -> 12878.70s]  think I was gonna say that. Genuinely upsetting. Genuinely upsetting. What do you got? Hello your
[12878.70s -> 12882.94s]  highness. Katamari Demasi is a really popular thing all around the world. Anyway I'm on a
[12882.94s -> 12887.90s]  camping trip right now. We're having a good time and every camping trip needs a campfire but
[12889.08s -> 12894.02s]  can't get the fire lit. I mean we haven't had any luck. Your highness can you help us out?
[12895.83s -> 12908.30s]  Of course I can. Long day today. Home in a hot bath. Oh we left a fire burning for the bath.
[12909.02s -> 12914.92s]  Oh opio what are we going to do? Huh? Campfire? If more important issue.
[12915.72s -> 12922.42s]  You must return to the royal castle and check on the fire for the bath. Katamari is live fantastic.
[12923.22s -> 12932.30s]  Think of that. Today is sauna day not bath day. That's why we left the fire burning on purpose.
[12932.30s -> 12946.58s]  Okay then to the campground. This is the campground. Wowies we're a little bit excited.
[12947.62s -> 12952.12s]  Everyone else looks like they're having fun too. We want to pitch a tent next to them.
[12952.20s -> 12959.56s]  Okay this is the small wood pile. Light this by rolling it up and you have a campfire.
[12961.34s -> 12973.37s]  Okay if you can manage in this much time that will make everyone happy. Okay I don't get it.
[12973.85s -> 13009.53s]  Should I? Because I can? Let's get big. Football. Bucket.
[13037.22s -> 13039.59s]  I can't pick up the buckets but I can pick up the cats.
[13039.59s -> 13066.86s]  Still going to play source 3 you bet. Dead on it? Oh yeah dead on it. Dead on it. I have a feeling
[13066.86s -> 13078.79s]  going in the water will be bad so I'm not going to. I will get the cinder.
[13084.26s -> 13088.68s]  Am I big enough to pick the mushrooms up yet? Now I probably am.
[13089.48s -> 13101.38s]  What about Hilux too? Oh yeah I'm back log barrier right now.
[13102.58s -> 13111.34s]  All right I don't want to touch this yet but I will roll over all this.
[13122.76s -> 13131.70s]  I gotta remember where this is up on the hill. Oh my god my eye is so itchy. What happened?
[13132.66s -> 13142.62s]  Why does it feel to be known as a liar? I'm like uh-oh. Why did I even look over a chat for no reason?
[13143.66s -> 13152.15s]  Fire goes out when you stick it in water. You should be able to understand that simple fact.
[13154.01s -> 13155.77s]  Please roll with some common sense.
[13165.70s -> 13169.78s]  Fire carrying everyone's trust. Fire that was going into his head went out.
[13170.66s -> 13177.50s]  This goes way beyond simple disappointment. Think about it. Hope you extinguish the flames
[13177.50s -> 13184.78s]  of their hope. They don't love it at all. They don't love us. No maybe the fire of our spirit.
[13189.54s -> 13197.83s]  From our eyes are these laser beams. Usually it's a much more effective form of spanking.
[13198.55s -> 13203.67s]  Re-lighting a fire that's gone out. It's not easy. We're going to go home now. Goodbye.
[13204.39s -> 13213.35s]  Oh this one is hard. You sound like Giga Chad. Oh I feel like I look like Giga Chad.
[13220.98s -> 13251.99s]  Did you even eat today? Yeah I had a little bit of avocado and a tortilla with some chicken
[13252.87s -> 13257.43s]  and some tabasco. It was pretty good.
[13267.29s -> 13275.03s]  And a gallon of milk. There's the milk guy again. There's Mr. Milk. And a gallon of milk too.
[13276.33s -> 13292.57s]  No no what was it the milk guy? There is a milk guy that's in the chat every day.
[13293.21s -> 13319.70s]  All right I think this can go out too. We care about your bones. I get plenty of calcium don't
[13319.70s -> 13338.90s]  worry about me. I'm going to go back to I need to I need to touch the fire right now or I'm dead.
[13345.61s -> 13348.73s]  Thoughts on you being a cultural and developmental figure of my life.
[13353.64s -> 13367.70s]  It's a good thing. It's a good thing. All right now that I got you here. Really? Okay.
[13368.66s -> 13375.14s]  Brush your teeth every day. Eat a well-balanced diet. Get sleep sleep every day. Make sure you
[13375.14s -> 13384.28s]  get some good sleep. Vegetables are not gross. Milk is fine but like don't eat too much. Don't
[13384.28s -> 13389.77s]  drink too much milk. Have some milk. I don't care. Sometimes you're gonna have milk.
[13392.01s -> 13397.59s]  Um try to be like nice to people if you can. I know it can be a problem sometimes. I get it.
[13398.71s -> 13404.23s]  I get it. Try to be like a try to be nice to people if you can. I know some people. I know
[13404.23s -> 13406.95s]  I get it. I know some people you just like oh how the fuck am I going to be the nicest person.
[13409.46s -> 13416.95s]  Try it. You try it. Try to be a good version of yourself right and we all
[13416.95s -> 13423.21s]  just go through ups and downs. I'm not telling you to be the best version of yourself because
[13424.17s -> 13441.11s]  you need to be. Let me just roll up a puncher. Thanks a lot dad. Fuck you game. I didn't even
[13441.11s -> 13451.21s]  pay attention to this. All right if I get hit once I'm going to delete my twitch channel after
[13451.21s -> 13469.61s]  next like six years from now. I'll play this again. And six years when I play this again I'm
[13469.61s -> 13477.22s]  going to do this exact thing and if I get hit then whatever. I was just went right into the water.
[13478.18s -> 13492.97s]  Is this a baby game. Yes and no. You can make this as difficult as you want or you can just
[13492.97s -> 13496.65s]  kind of roll up stuff and have fun. You don't have to take it too seriously.
[13501.21s -> 13505.18s]  Which to me that's the best kind of game. A game that's just fun to play.
[13505.90s -> 13513.16s]  No pressure on it or anything. But you could really go hard with this game and be very good at it.
[13514.12s -> 13533.21s]  I typed that three hours ago dude. This is a reddit game. What does that even mean anymore?
[13533.21s -> 13541.03s]  That's losing meaning. That's losing meaning. Everything is a reddit thing.
[13542.79s -> 13547.03s]  I think you're replacing that with like all right this thing that I think is kind of stupid.
[13547.99s -> 13549.35s]  This is a reddit game.
[13568.82s -> 13572.02s]  Reddit chill. Yeah well that one makes sense to me.
[13584.55s -> 13593.67s]  I think they mean it's a game for millennials.
[13595.91s -> 13603.16s]  I mean this game I mean this came out when I was
[13606.15s -> 13608.95s]  19 18 or something 20. I don't know. When did this come out?
[13611.03s -> 13615.83s]  How old was I when this came out? 17 or something. I need a fire right now. Hurry up go.
[13616.55s -> 13631.03s]  Oh my god I'm not paying any attention. Can you please remind me to take my pizza out of the
[13631.03s -> 13642.02s]  oven in 30 minutes. 30 minutes. Bro why are you cooking a pizza for 30 minutes.
[13643.14s -> 13655.99s]  I think it's gonna be like charcoal. It's gonna be a slow roast.
[13656.79s -> 13673.14s]  It's gonna be a burnt ass pizza. Yeah slow roast pizza. Would that do anything?
[13673.70s -> 13676.42s]  Okay let's have a food conversation. That's our favorite thing sir.
[13677.06s -> 13685.18s]  If you put a pizza in the oven at like 250 degrees and you cooked it for an hour. What would happen?
[13685.18s -> 13696.63s]  But like 200. What what what? It would be awful. It would be terrible. It would just be a bad pizza.
[13696.71s -> 13698.95s]  It would be very yeah it would be terrible.
[13701.74s -> 13713.30s]  Frozen pizza is gonna be it's gonna be terrible already. There are some good frozen pizzas.
[13713.30s -> 13715.70s]  I'm telling you I don't need I don't see them anymore. They probably I don't know
[13715.70s -> 13718.58s]  they probably fucking discontinued the whole franchise. I have no idea.
[13724.54s -> 13729.90s]  Uh Dr. Roker's pizza doesn't exist anymore. I don't I can't find it anywhere.
[13730.54s -> 13743.74s]  That shit was actually phenomenal. All right I'm not confident that I can do this one that well so
[13743.74s -> 13751.22s]  I'm gonna end it soon here. I'm gonna just go in there and do it. I'll try for like two or three.
[13754.60s -> 13761.88s]  30 minutes for a pizza though. That does feel like a very long time. Uh DiGiorno? If I could do a
[13761.88s -> 13768.54s]  pizza tier list frozen pizza tier list I could probably do it. I've had a lot of them. Uh DiGiorno
[13768.54s -> 13781.46s]  stuffed crust is pretty high up there. I'd say it's very high up there. It's in fire bro. I know I
[13781.46s -> 13800.02s]  got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Fire up there. I only have 27 seconds. I thought
[13800.02s -> 13825.06s]  there was no timer. Just hit me. Oh my fucking god. I didn't think there was a timer. Did that
[13825.06s -> 13828.82s]  timer disappear out of nowhere or was I just not paying any attention to the game? I was just
[13828.82s -> 13835.08s]  talking about pizza. There is a timer. Okay I just I seriously was not even looking. The game was
[13835.08s -> 13841.19s]  playing by itself. I was in food mode. You know a game actually has a great food mode that we've
[13841.19s -> 13846.17s]  not talked about. Red Dead Redemption 2. It has an unbelievable food mode. You just have to hold down
[13846.17s -> 13857.99s]  a button. You can sit there and just watch the conversations that happen within Red Dead
[13858.63s -> 13861.67s]  in the cinematic mode because they just stay on the road if you press one button.
[13862.47s -> 13865.67s]  So you can sit there and you can at least at least one hand to eat. I got a bag of chips.
[13871.42s -> 13881.91s]  TF2 has a food mode. It's called engineer. No no. That's it. Yeah I know. You know how I know that
[13881.99s -> 13888.31s]  you get backstabbed every single fucking time you play the game because you AFK standing. First of
[13888.31s -> 13893.59s]  all you put you didn't put your dispenser against a wall and you didn't protect your back with the
[13893.59s -> 13898.79s]  dispenser. The only way okay the dispenser right behind you and the sentry right in front of you
[13898.79s -> 13904.47s]  and the teleporter right to your left. Spy has to jump on top of your shit and then crouch and try
[13904.47s -> 13909.91s]  to get you. As long as you're looking around it's not gonna happen. I can tell you get backstabbed
[13909.91s -> 13914.95s]  all the time. Food mode is engineer. That was one of the most involved classes in the whole game.
[13914.95s -> 13924.39s]  Gotta move that gear up. What are you talking about? You know what I want to play and I'm gonna do it
[13924.39s -> 13929.93s]  eventually here because it's like seriously the only time a company has ever made a fucking fun
[13929.93s -> 13937.05s]  version of this thing and how infuriating is what I am about to tell you. Team Fortress 2
[13937.05s -> 13942.73s]  comes out with this game mode called man versus machine. I was playing man versus machine and
[13942.73s -> 13947.21s]  sitting there thinking wow this is going to be a new paradigm for video games. I cannot wait until
[13947.21s -> 13952.41s]  more companies make this shit. I can't wait to play this in more first person shooters.
[13953.45s -> 13962.18s]  Team Fortress is the only game to make one of those fun. The only one. I feel like it's the only
[13962.18s -> 13968.94s]  one I've played that I genuinely fucking loved every second of it. I've played the other ones.
[13969.74s -> 13973.10s]  They're okay. They're good but they just say that it doesn't even come close.
[13977.02s -> 13985.21s]  Man versus machine is some of the most fun I've had in Team Fortress. So here's what I'm telling
[13985.21s -> 13993.06s]  you that I'm gonna do. Listen up. I'm going to set up a man versus machine scream or something
[13993.94s -> 13999.86s]  with screamers. See if I can get like five, six people. Sounds like a lot of fun doesn't it?
[14002.06s -> 14011.77s]  I actually have been thinking about doing this for a long time just because of how
[14011.77s -> 14015.05s]  long it's been since I played it. Just how much fun I remember it being.
[14017.98s -> 14022.31s]  I cannot tell you there's something that's going to happen immediately. It's going to take a little
[14022.31s -> 14027.27s]  while. Not that it's oh my god it takes so long to get to get into man versus machine but
[14028.55s -> 14036.54s]  it's something I do want to do. Because I feel like don't correct me if I'm wrong here everybody.
[14037.42s -> 14040.95s]  You can call me a boomer if you want. Call me a boomer. Call me a millennial. Whatever you
[14040.95s -> 14048.12s]  want to say. I feel like a lot of people in the kind of gaming world right now or PC gaming at
[14048.12s -> 14055.83s]  least didn't really ever experience TF2. Have you noticed that? TF2 is kind of people go oh yeah I've
[14055.83s -> 14061.21s]  like heard of that. It sounds like that's fun. Yeah I've heard of that. I mean you heard of it.
[14061.21s -> 14073.37s]  You've only heard of it? Have you played it? Oh not for very long. Man really? I feel like it was
[14073.37s -> 14085.37s]  kind of its own era. But I'm kind of getting the itch to not necessarily I don't know not to play
[14085.37s -> 14091.85s]  Team Fortress again. I really don't think that's going to happen. But man versus machine I've
[14091.85s -> 14100.38s]  been itching to play it. Never played it. Never played it. All right you know you know let's do
[14100.38s -> 14106.38s]  a real like not no joking around no fucking around right now. Mods aren't full. How many of you here
[14107.18s -> 14114.14s]  have played Team Fortress 2 for more than three hours? Like you've played it for more than a few
[14114.14s -> 14118.62s]  hours. How many people here have done that? More than a few. Like let's go with five hours
[14119.58s -> 14123.02s]  because I feel like that's a good amount of time to be like okay I'm not playing the game then I'm
[14123.02s -> 14144.74s]  going to lose. Yeah if you played for over five hours like all right pretty curious. The orange
[14144.74s -> 14152.04s]  box. Orange box is I think will go down in history as the single greatest thing to ever be on the
[14152.04s -> 14158.70s]  shelf. I don't think people understood back in the day of of everything has to be monetized.
[14158.70s -> 14162.46s]  Everything has to be separated and monetized. Everything has to be if they spend tons of money
[14162.46s -> 14170.62s]  on it. The orange box was like five fucking full games in one box and they just were like yeah
[14170.62s -> 14175.90s]  have it. We don't even give a shit. Have all these have all these genre defining experiences in the
[14175.90s -> 14183.86s]  same fucking box. At least three of those things in the orange box were genre defining experiences
[14184.50s -> 14193.18s]  and it's all in the same box. So all right so 60% of you so that means 40% of you
[14193.18s -> 14199.98s]  have not really played Team Fortress 2 more than a few hours probably. That's pretty remarkable
[14199.98s -> 14208.60s]  honestly. Now TF2 is I want to say they they want to do oh we're gonna fix stuff and do updates and
[14208.60s -> 14217.26s]  stuff. I don't know I haven't repaid I haven't paid that much attention to it. I just know that
[14217.26s -> 14224.17s]  they were doing stuff like oh we are gonna do some updates and try to do some fixing and change
[14224.17s -> 14238.95s]  this and get rid of that and I have to imagine at this point it's so it's so old now and I don't
[14238.95s -> 14243.99s]  know if the money is there for them to kind of do like a TF2 remaster or something or you don't
[14243.99s -> 14254.15s]  even really need to. I feel like that game still holds up. Isn't that weird? That game is so old
[14255.11s -> 14268.49s]  but still holds up. Fortress Source 2. We thought they were gonna do that years and years ago.
[14268.49s -> 14286.60s]  It just never happened. We got a mushroom as a present. We really hate mushrooms. Opio you can
[14286.60s -> 14293.90s]  have it. What if I had? Make sure you appreciate it. Oh it's second cousin Kinoko. What were you
[14293.90s -> 14308.44s]  doing on earth? Dancing with the grandpa. Every time TF2 is gonna do I just doesn't feel the same.
[14309.40s -> 14313.32s]  Remember when TF2 was gonna do a huge update and they're gonna add a ton of shit and people had no
[14313.32s -> 14318.04s]  idea what it was gonna be? I guess maybe Fortnite still kind of does that don't they? Where it's
[14318.04s -> 14325.24s]  like hey we here comes something huge. There's a ton of new shit in this. Does it still hit as hard
[14325.24s -> 14346.52s]  as it did back then? Tell me the truth. What's your TF2 blunt rotation? Engineer, Spy, Heavy, Pyro.
[14346.60s -> 14358.71s]  Engineer, Heavy, Spy, Pyro. What about the demo man? You what you don't I want to go out I want
[14358.71s -> 14382.12s]  to go out drinking with the demo man. What are you talking about? No I and by the way my it's yeah
[14382.12s -> 14392.86s]  he's definitely already thought about this. What about the scout? No no no no the scout's gonna
[14392.86s -> 14398.06s]  take like the scout's gonna take like two like a puff and just start freaking out and yelling
[14398.06s -> 14403.13s]  about aliens and stuff like he's gonna be he's gonna talk about the aliens that come through
[14403.13s -> 14414.89s]  the walls and shit now it's gonna be like oh man okay that's literally you yeah well you gotta
[14414.89s -> 14440.18s]  put up with me all right that's how it works that's just you yeah well nightmare blunt rotation
