[1.91s -> 12.71s]  Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. This dude hates sorcery. I don't hate sorcery.
[15.80s -> 23.43s]  I don't hate sorcery. Why'd you get, where'd you get that idea? I mean you thought there was
[23.43s -> 30.34s]  gonna be sorcery today, but you were wrong and so was I. And there's a reason for it.
[30.34s -> 41.77s]  Reason number one, to be very clear. Uh, I didn't want to play it for like an hour and 40 minutes.
[41.77s -> 51.13s]  Reason number two, pre-stream chat decided, they decided, not to do it today.
[52.50s -> 61.88s]  It's like 150 people guys. Pre-stream chat wanted their, their own sorcery stream. Its own stream,
[61.88s -> 69.90s]  not just like a couple hours. And the new Hitman map came out and what is this thing popping up
[69.90s -> 76.30s]  on the top of my, what is this? What's this new thing they added? I keep seeing the different subs
[76.30s -> 84.26s]  pop in and out. I don't like this. How do I get rid of this? How do I get rid of this activity feed?
[84.26s -> 92.62s]  I don't want this activity feed. Anyways, uh, yeah, sorcery will be its own thing.
[93.58s -> 101.43s]  Uh, we're also going to play multiverses today in a sponsor segment. I fucking love that game,
[101.43s -> 118.57s]  by the way. While I was kind of sick, I was been playing it on my Xbox. Shhh. I'm just sitting
[118.57s -> 125.32s]  there sick playing it on Xbox. Xbox Andy. Yeah, guess what? Series S. What's wrong with it?
[126.65s -> 140.70s]  It's everything you want in a console. I actually believe that. The Xbox is a stinker. No, it is not.
[140.70s -> 148.36s]  The Xbox Series S is actually really good. You get the game pass on there. You can put on YouTube
[148.36s -> 155.94s]  and Twitch. It's like a media box for me. It's not a console. That's literally your worst take.
[155.94s -> 160.90s]  I just made that up. I made that person up. No one said that. I combined three messages.
[162.30s -> 167.24s]  Somebody said, that is your worst. And then somebody said, I'm getting takeout tonight.
[167.24s -> 176.58s]  And I just combined them to make my narrative make sense. Anyways, uh, Hitman has a new map.
[176.58s -> 183.67s]  I played all the Hitmans, obviously. So we're going to do this. I'm feeling better. A lot better
[183.67s -> 190.01s]  than I was a week ago. So I think I'm all right now. For those of you that were curious, COVID
[190.01s -> 196.81s]  kind of came through the house a week and a half ago or so. And then I got put into a colitis flare
[196.81s -> 204.82s]  up probably because of it. I'm negative for COVID, but I have this colitis problem. So, but that's
[204.82s -> 208.58s]  getting worse. That's fine. That's not out of the ordinary. I know how to deal with that,
[209.61s -> 217.37s]  but we're good to go. Anyways, let me tweet. Give me one second. I got to make sure I get this right.
[217.37s -> 322.62s]  One sec. Hey, I'm back. All right. So let's do the Hitman map. I haven't played Hitman since Hitman 3
[322.62s -> 327.54s]  VR, which I wasn't a big fan of. In fact, I was very, very adamantly opposed to it.
[327.54s -> 334.33s]  Must be a long ass tweet. No, it wasn't. I just, I had to go grab, I had to get something.
[334.33s -> 349.24s]  All right. You guys ready for Hitman? You guys good for Hitman? Okay. Is the new map any good?
[349.24s -> 354.26s]  How does it compare to the rest of the series? Am I going to like it? Am I going to hate it?
[354.26s -> 364.31s]  How is it? Be honest. Don't sugar coat this. Is it all right? No idea. I mean, it literally came out
[364.31s -> 372.68s]  like two, three days ago. So maybe you don't know. All right, let's go. What's my title? Oh,
[372.68s -> 377.02s]  it's all right. That title's fine. It's another concrete level. It fucking better not be.
[378.10s -> 396.90s]  I actually mean that. It better not be. Is it actually? Better not be. That's fucking loud.
[396.90s -> 407.29s]  All right. Are you guys ready? Destinations. It's this Ambrose Island. Is this new one?
[407.29s -> 422.68s]  Are you guys ready for this? Should I turn it up? Should I turn it down? Handsome.
[427.59s -> 438.36s]  Go away. Red Andy. My skin is tinted a little orange. So what? Fuck off. I have like red,
[438.36s -> 443.91s]  I have red, rosy, red cheeks. Fuck you. All right. You got a problem?
[443.91s -> 464.15s]  Then speak it into the speaker. The Ark Society's annual.
[464.15s -> 473.56s]  Are all these people dead? Which should give us ample time. Mr. Gray has an off the books
[473.56s -> 478.71s]  request. Perhaps you should explain. I actually don't know. No crest.
[479.43s -> 483.99s]  Spoilers. My best fixes. It's Hitman three. It's your fault for being here.
[484.07s -> 490.34s]  The militia literally hit man three to cease all attacks on Providence.
[490.34s -> 504.06s]  Stand by and crest and his men reinventing themselves as a glorified gang of international
[504.06s -> 511.82s]  thieves. They specialize in ruthless spectacle, heists, zero regard to collateral damage.
[511.82s -> 517.48s]  I've seen the man's file. What did you expect? It's not like I had much choice.
[518.20s -> 521.00s]  Seeing as all my best lieutenants were killed by you too.
[524.84s -> 538.36s]  Crest is a rabid dog is my responsibility. Shut up. You don't care. An isolated harbor
[538.36s -> 544.68s]  north from the Strait of Malacca. Coincidentally, one of Wazir's old ports of call.
[545.64s -> 551.24s]  According to my intel crest and his men have joined forces with the local pirate syndicate
[551.24s -> 558.12s]  to raid a passing tanker. His goal control unit for an ether core being covertly shipped abroad.
[558.92s -> 563.96s]  The satellite is a node in the company's most secure cloud storage network.
[564.76s -> 570.84s]  So they would bear a fortune to preserve its integrity. What is Crest's end game extortion?
[570.84s -> 576.92s]  Money. If I had to guess, we don't have the luxury of a full investigation for us to move
[576.92s -> 581.96s]  against the constant. We need Providence to think the threat is over and lower their guard.
[582.76s -> 590.66s]  Another militia attack on ether will raise alarms. I agree. 47. You'll need to eliminate
[590.66s -> 596.98s]  Crest and destroy that control unit before we lock the militia out. The satellite cannot fall into
[596.98s -> 603.30s]  their hands. We'll need a cover story for ICA. I only need one grenade and I'll be able to do it
[603.30s -> 609.78s]  easily. The syndicate already has an active ICA contract on her head. Take her out and
[609.78s -> 616.74s]  we'll even get our expenses paid. Well, I never had you pegged as a rebel. I'm warming to it.
[616.74s -> 621.38s]  Are you eating toothpaste? What are you talking about? 47, seeing as I know Crest,
[621.38s -> 629.83s]  I'll provide field support. Meet you out east. Sounds like a plan. 47 out.
[630.39s -> 643.82s]  You hate it. Go again. Fucking relax. I haven't streamed like a week. Sorry, guys. I have a lot
[643.82s -> 652.02s]  of energy right now. Um, hold on. Uh, I gotta turn this back on and ask me what happened. Hey,
[652.02s -> 665.11s]  there I am. All right. So we need to, uh, we need to, we gotta kill, kill, kill. I haven't played
[665.11s -> 669.56s]  Hitman in a while either. What's with the toothpaste stuff? I don't know. Why are you asking about
[669.56s -> 679.50s]  toothpaste? Can somebody fill me in on what the toothpaste thing is here? It's toothpaste joke.
[680.06s -> 684.63s]  I don't get it. All right, let's go. Uh, I, I'm going to do default Andy. That's fine.
[685.58s -> 693.03s]  Neutralize the satellite control unit. Easy enough. You know, I, I keep avoiding on,
[693.03s -> 703.14s]  I feel like this is a YouTube embedded video. Is it? It is. Okay. I thought that was,
[703.86s -> 715.18s]  but how do I go? Okay. Play. All right. Let's go. Let's go. It's been a while since I've
[715.18s -> 719.82s]  turned a computer on. I'm not fucking around. I've not turned this computer on. I have not
[719.82s -> 726.97s]  turned on the computer in five days. I think that's accurate. All right. Professionals fine.
[728.25s -> 739.35s]  Master. Why is this on master? Who did that? I didn't do that. Is it weird that I actually?
[739.35s -> 752.89s]  No, we're not doing master. No way. When did I put master on? Try master for one life? No,
[754.78s -> 763.62s]  I don't think so. Just in time. It seems crest didn't disclose the true object of the heist to
[763.62s -> 769.46s]  his partners. Okay. So Acre has seized one of the satellite control units, key cards as collateral
[769.46s -> 776.42s]  until they can renegotiate. The militia have set up camp near the remains of a colonial outpost.
[776.42s -> 782.34s]  Both crest and the control unit should be nearby. You'll need to destroy the unit itself or render
[782.34s -> 787.78s]  it inoperable by retrieving both key cards. Give me a grenade crest. He'll have given his to someone
[787.78s -> 793.70s]  he trusts, but Acre is less inclined to delegate. She should be in the pirate place when she's not
[793.70s -> 800.60s]  out among the locals. Okay. I provided you with a GPS tracker. Activate it when you're done and
[800.60s -> 808.22s]  I'll initiate extraction. The sooner we finish up here, the better. All right. Sounds easy enough.
[808.22s -> 813.98s]  I thought it was like a superhero costume. I was like, holy shit, I have like a superhero costume on.
[816.65s -> 822.74s]  Okay. How are we doing? We effing? It's going to happen. Unfortunately, I have to deal with it
[822.74s -> 827.62s]  for now. Okay. Eliminate, eliminate, deny access to the surveillance satellite,
[827.62s -> 838.41s]  destroy the satellite. Who's this guy? All right. Let's get over here. It's like an island.
[849.08s -> 858.98s]  Am I allowed in here? How's this? I'm not trespassing. What? I'm just going to the freezer.
[861.80s -> 877.83s]  This is just weird. Okay. Is there anything I can do in here? Wait, fish. Got it. Can I take, wait,
[877.83s -> 891.00s]  what's this? A fishing line. Okay. Might be useful later. All right. We're good. All right.
[891.00s -> 898.62s]  Let's go. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to, I'm not going to. These are the targets. No, what? No,
[898.62s -> 914.18s]  they're not. Not even close. Destroy satellite control unit. Do I have to do that or can I just
[914.18s -> 919.50s]  throw a brick through a window and hit the person in the head? Stop saying teeth. I don't know what
[919.50s -> 929.03s]  that means. I'm going to go this way. What do I have for weapons? How do I open up my menu? Is it
[929.03s -> 940.28s]  tab? Holds a button. What's the menu? I, yeah. Okay. GPS tracker. Coin. Gun. All right. Let's go.
[940.28s -> 959.88s]  I forgot how pretty this game was. Okay. Right over here. That's the first target. Should I
[959.88s -> 965.40s]  change disguise? I'm just kind of a guy in a scuba outfit. Is that weird? Is it weird for me to be
[965.40s -> 985.32s]  look like this? Is this weird? You too? No, this is not weird. Why do I have music? Holy shit. This
[985.32s -> 1009.16s]  guy's got a whole studio in here. I got to get in there. This streamer. Please go away from me.
[1009.16s -> 1017.93s]  How do I get in here? Why can't I go in? I can't climb in this. I have a lockpick though, don't I?
[1018.49s -> 1025.38s]  Let's put the gun away, please. Don't I have a lock? Yeah, I do. I don't have a lockpick. How?
[1025.94s -> 1046.60s]  All right. I need to find the key. I need to get in that streamer room. Pretty much how I do
[1046.60s -> 1052.20s]  fishing as well. How many of you guys go fishing and just cast into the water and just reel it
[1052.20s -> 1056.28s]  back and you're not even trying? You're just humoring the one friend that actually wants to
[1056.28s -> 1064.71s]  be there. Okay. I don't know how to get in there, but is there Intel over there? No.
[1083.62s -> 1091.83s]  Okay. All right. This person's right over here. Wait, what's that?
[1103.99s -> 1112.90s]  I'm making sure I have a lot of stuff too. What is this? What? Is it arm wrestling?
[1129.42s -> 1134.22s]  Okay. I've seen these videos before. I've seen. Let's go. You want to fucking go?
[1136.74s -> 1147.45s]  Hold on. I can't save right now? Next round. Let's see. What happened? All right. I'm ready.
[1148.09s -> 1164.49s]  Ready up. Wind up. I don't get it. Do I have to tap? Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Okay.
[1173.06s -> 1183.32s]  You hurt his hand on my face. Why am I making it out of cement? All right. I'm going to get
[1183.32s -> 1195.61s]  this guy right here. See you later. I killed that guy. I legitimately, I think I just killed him.
[1197.13s -> 1234.86s]  Come on. Get up here. I have to go through all of them. Okay. Should I just drop him? Shut up.
[1236.18s -> 1241.98s]  Why don't you get up here and show me? Wait, this is the guy.
[1249.03s -> 1269.13s]  I hope I can do it to him. So now what? I get to be friends with this guy?
[1270.09s -> 1281.74s]  Can I save the game? I would save the game. I can't save it. I have to just do this until
[1281.74s -> 1297.24s]  I can stop. Okay. Is it going to like cut to the next scene where every single person in the town
[1297.24s -> 1304.20s]  has a red hand on their face and I'm like counting hundreds? I don't understand. How many more times
[1304.20s -> 1325.59s]  do I have to do this? What the fuck? Why didn't they shoot me? Why didn't they do anything?
[1326.39s -> 1335.06s]  I'm so confused. What? Why didn't they do anything? I don't understand why they didn't do anything.
[1335.62s -> 1340.33s]  I literally aimed the gun and shot the guy in the head and everyone was aiming at me.
[1355.14s -> 1358.18s]  I'm going to do this to everybody here. I'm going to hit every single person here.
[1366.15s -> 1372.23s]  Should I? Krust appears impressed and has requested to talk with you. Oh wait. That's me
[1373.45s -> 1385.62s]  talking to me. What's up? I guess so. I want to talk to you about something in private.
[1385.62s -> 1390.90s]  Nothing sinister. There's no hard feelings here. I just have an offer for you. Come and hear me out.
[1390.90s -> 1398.46s]  That's all I ask. Are we going to go with a bodyguard? Hey, are you the guy that can
[1398.46s -> 1403.74s]  clearly kick the shit out of every bodyguard I have stronger than all my men? Come over here
[1403.74s -> 1410.62s]  in private with me alone. I'm the wicked rich guy. Why would we do this alone? Should I just
[1410.62s -> 1415.94s]  do it now? Oh my god. There are two bodyguards here. I was about to strangle them.
[1424.60s -> 1432.55s]  Bro, you're going to stand right next to the red barrel. This guy was talking shit earlier
[1432.55s -> 1439.27s]  about cartoons. You're in one right now. What? You're standing right next to the red explosive
[1439.27s -> 1448.38s]  barrel. Okay.
[1452.30s -> 1457.10s]  Punishment someone who could be an inside man but won't buckle under intense interrogation
[1457.10s -> 1462.38s]  if he's caught. I'd do it myself but my time and expertise would be better spent covering our tracks
[1462.38s -> 1467.42s]  and you've shown me that my guys aren't up for the job either. Smoking next to a red cartoon
[1467.42s -> 1482.47s]  barrel. I can hold my own. Excuse me. Why was he itching his wrists? That guy was itchy.
[1483.03s -> 1490.36s]  He didn't even. Why did it not explode? Hold on. Why did it not explode? He was just itching his arm.
[1494.71s -> 1499.11s]  Hollywood about it. Hold on. Come on. Your attention span can't be that fucking.
[1512.70s -> 1527.35s]  I'm gonna hide. I can't even. Where am I going? What happened? Should I do it for real? I gotta
[1527.35s -> 1542.84s]  do it for real. I gotta do it for real. I have to do that mission for real. Let me do it for real.
[1542.84s -> 1548.38s]  I'm gonna do it for real. I'll do it for real. I'm gonna do it for real. All right. I'm gonna do it
[1548.38s -> 1558.97s]  for real. For real. For real. No more fucking around. Could I have poisoned his cigar or something?
[1561.67s -> 1568.39s]  Certain prominent individuals, government facilities, big targets. But that means big payouts.
[1568.39s -> 1572.71s]  I'm looking for someone who can take a little punishment. Someone who could be an inside man.
[1572.71s -> 1577.27s]  Okay. Buckle under intense interrogation if he's caught. I'd do it myself but my time and
[1577.27s -> 1582.63s]  expertise would be better spent covering our tracks. And you've shown me that my guys aren't up for the
[1582.63s -> 1588.55s]  job either. I need someone I can depend on. I can hold my own. I know we only just met but you have
[1588.63s -> 1594.79s]  this quality to you. I can't really pin it down. It's familiar but alien at the same time and
[1594.79s -> 1599.59s]  your face. Don't take this the wrong way but it feels like if I looked away for a minute I'd
[1599.59s -> 1605.59s]  completely forget every feature. You might be my missing piece here. I don't need or want a decision
[1605.59s -> 1609.75s]  right now. This is a life-changing choice. I know we just met. It could be the start of some big
[1609.75s -> 1615.43s]  things for you but there would be no backing out. I don't need any more disappointments. Make sure
[1615.51s -> 1620.15s]  this is what you really want. I'll be here for a few more days at least so
[1620.15s -> 1630.98s]  no rush. I'll think about it. What happened? What's going on? Can I say yes? What was that?
[1637.21s -> 1657.45s]  No fuck you! I wanted his outfit! No shit! I wanted the outfit. Oh god damn it. I swear to god.
[1658.01s -> 1663.93s]  Government facilities big targets but that means big payouts. Just puncture the barrel.
[1665.66s -> 1670.22s]  Someone who could be an inside man but won't buckle. Yeah I'll do it. How do I say I'll do it?
[1670.22s -> 1674.06s]  I'd do it myself but my time and expertise would be better spent covering our tracks.
[1674.06s -> 1679.22s]  How do I say yes I'll do it? You've shown me that my guys aren't up either. I need someone I can
[1679.22s -> 1689.30s]  depend on. I can hold my own. I know we only just met but you have this quality to you. I can't
[1689.38s -> 1693.94s]  really pin it down. It's familiar alien at the same time and your face. I think I have to go
[1693.94s -> 1697.62s]  find him again. I don't take this the wrong way but it feels like if I looked away for a minute
[1697.62s -> 1703.06s]  I'd completely forget every feature. But if I go get a different disguise won't he not know who I am?
[1703.06s -> 1707.54s]  If you want a decision right now this is a life-changing choice. It could be the start
[1707.54s -> 1712.42s]  of some big things for you. Okay no backing out. I'll do it. I don't need any more disappointments.
[1713.06s -> 1717.86s]  Make sure this is what you really want. Yes. I'll be here for a few more days at least so
[1717.86s -> 1727.62s]  okay. All right so I was fine. I freaked out. Okay sounds good. Yes I'll do it. So now I'll
[1727.62s -> 1738.57s]  just have to go talk to him again. Thank you. All right goodbye. I need to find out what that is
[1738.57s -> 1769.91s]  right? Like what's going on here? Is somebody in this house moaning? Why? They're in there.
[1769.91s -> 1784.25s]  Am I allowed to go in here? We can't enjoy the fucking movie. Why? We can't hear anything.
[1784.73s -> 1792.22s]  All right let's watch it. Turn off the projector. You need to.
[1806.76s -> 1808.63s]  What happens if I do this?
[1819.08s -> 1825.67s]  You know you weren't even watching the video. You weren't even watching the video.
[1867.38s -> 1868.50s]  Dangerous fucker.
[1877.05s -> 1894.71s]  That guy got out of here quick. I don't have a disguise on. Why did Peter Griffin just come in?
[1894.71s -> 1913.85s]  That's just fucking out of place. Hey Loish remember that time. I'm in trouble. I gotta
[1913.85s -> 1922.73s]  get out of here. That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy.
[1922.73s -> 1939.96s]  That's the guy. That's the guy. That's the guy. What was he doing outside the door? Holy crap.
[1940.60s -> 1972.78s]  Don't do it. Don't open it. Clueless. Wait is this the guy that was in here originally?
[1972.78s -> 1976.92s]  You're not going to sit down and watch the YouTube video right? No you're not going to
[1976.92s -> 1996.89s]  come back and watch the YouTube video. It's just smoke. Did I win? I have to wait. There's
[1996.89s -> 2012.41s]  another person to kill. I dropped my cigarette. It was in my mouth and I dropped it. Somebody help.
[2012.41s -> 2013.69s]  My cigarette hit the ground.
[2013.69s -> 2030.06s]  Did she just puke? I have to get out of here. I have to get out of here.
[2032.90s -> 2050.14s]  I have to leave. Alright everybody get out. I wonder what he's going to do. Does he remember?
[2051.42s -> 2074.92s]  You remember me? No fuck. No I'm back in this stupid. Alright I'm going to do it for real.

[2119.06s -> 2124.58s]  somebody is hitting me in the fucking face in real life. That's hitting me in the face in real life
[2124.58s -> 2138.04s]  every time I hear it. Okay so are you? It's in. Oh this is. Oh. Hold on. Getting them both in place
[2138.04s -> 2145.58s]  would certainly save some time. Okay so should I go to the meeting? I'm using the light to signal
[2145.58s -> 2150.06s]  for Crest when she wants a meeting. The light. It shouldn't be too difficult to exploit that. Okay.
[2152.06s -> 2158.54s]  Also known as Akka, leader of the pirates. She should be carrying one of the key cards for the
[2158.54s -> 2174.65s]  control unit. Okay. Is this weird to do this? Probably. I mean is it is this is it weird to
[2174.65s -> 2192.46s]  do this? I mean it's kind of odd but is it really gonna get me in trouble? Alright I'm gonna go
[2192.46s -> 2201.72s]  talk to that guy. He's like come find me if you want to actually do the thing. Alright let's go.

[2212.46s -> 2234.95s]  interesting. Whatever this is. What's going on in here? There's always a chef. Have you guys noticed
[2234.95s -> 2240.46s]  that? There's always just the kitchen with the kitchen knife and the chef where you can
[2240.46s -> 2255.22s]  poison the meat. Really? Oh this is I guess I'm not allowed. You don't. He didn't seem to really give
[2255.22s -> 2289.78s]  a shit. Okay. What can I do in here? Can they see? What happened? I need to get a disguise or just
[2289.78s -> 2304.68s]  say fuck it and not go in. There's not a good opportunity for a disguise. Where's my coin?
[2310.90s -> 2316.41s]  I have this mission going already. Let me just do this one. This seems like the best idea. He's
[2316.41s -> 2323.14s]  like come find me and tell me if you want to do it or not. So let's go do it. I just walk up to
[2323.14s -> 2339.86s]  him? Alright I'm ready. I'm ready to do your fucking weird mission. Alright I'm ready to do

[2397.59s -> 2408.39s]  right? Whatever he said. But the last like two or three straight minutes I've been larping as this
[2408.39s -> 2428.26s]  guy's security guard. I mean I there's got to be a way I can activate this right? That was the chance
[2428.26s -> 2435.50s]  to kill him. Oh but I thought he wanted to make join me like me we join oh now he's back watching
[2435.50s -> 2444.07s]  the slap fight again. What if I do the slap fight again? Let me impress him again. Hey remember me?

[2804.70s -> 2828.73s]  teeth thing? I don't get the teeth thing. I have an idea. Nobody can even see me right now. I actually
[2828.73s -> 2849.38s]  don't think they can see me. Oh yeah they can. I thought like metal gear solid you know. There's
[2849.38s -> 2876.73s]  like the window where they can't see. Okay what's that? Hold on. This is a water pump. Repairs on
[2876.73s -> 2881.70s]  Chris's boat are held up and it doesn't look like they're going to happen anytime soon. Perhaps the
[2881.70s -> 2902.70s]  local mechanics could use an extra set of hands. Okay. Okay. Do you need some help?
[2903.02s -> 2918.63s]  I need a screwdriver.
[2934.60s -> 2946.01s]  How do you guys not have? How is that not a screwdriver? Oh there's a wrench. No it's a pipe.
[2948.90s -> 2960.58s]  Is there no wrench in here? A crowbar? Use cell. How is there no wrench?
[2987.46s -> 3010.44s]  I just like what the fuck am I supposed to do? I mean where's the wrench? I love throwing car
[3010.44s -> 3013.24s]  batteries. We already went over this right? How many car batteries would it take to actually
[3013.24s -> 3032.28s]  electrify the ocean? That's far away. Not really. A signal light on the radar tower. So when does
[3032.28s -> 3041.80s]  that happen? Should I just go? Hold on. So what they're gonna flash a bat signal and I'm supposed
[3041.80s -> 3065.75s]  to go to the meeting? I can trigger it. Oh let's go do that. What's the best way to get there?
[3074.42s -> 3079.51s]  What do you want? What of it? Yeah. Yeah. What about it?
[3087.00s -> 3095.51s]  What do you find? A coconut? I has asked 47 to fetch her a coconut. How quaint. But who
[3095.51s -> 3108.89s]  knows what may come from doing a favor for it. All right let's go get a coconut. Coconut right
[3108.89s -> 3126.39s]  here. How do I get there? Do I have to climb this? Can I shoot it down with a gun? People are not
[3126.39s -> 3159.74s]  gonna freak out about this right? What the fuck? Huh? What the? Okay um that's not how you get them.
[3159.74s -> 3182.22s]  Oh what the fuck? Oh what? Were those not coconuts? They definitely were. Okay where would I? Okay I
[3182.22s -> 3186.78s]  have to destroy the control unit or yeah I'm gonna destroy it. I'm not gonna go get fucking
[3186.78s -> 3223.38s]  access keys. No thanks. Let's go destroy it. I'm technically allowed in here. Where's that camera?
[3223.38s -> 3267.29s]  They don't care. I'm allowed to be down here. I'm in the uniform right? Okay never mind. Really?
[3267.29s -> 3280.66s]  What are the weird cartoon objects do I have? It's only two. That was louder than anything else
[3280.66s -> 3297.80s]  I've done so far. Can I hide them anywhere? Not really. Bring the fish back. What's quick save?
[3297.88s -> 3316.14s]  How do I quick save? Whatever somebody comes down here they come down here. Five. If somebody comes
[3316.14s -> 3325.53s]  down they come down. Whatever. What am I gonna do about it? F5? All right let's go. While I'm
[3325.53s -> 3343.02s]  allowed down here. Fire extinguisher? Okay I gotta be careful. That's the control unit. You'll need
[3343.02s -> 3349.18s]  to either destroy it or deny access to keep the ether satellite out of the militia's hands. Oh
[3349.18s -> 3373.14s]  fuck. Stop talking to me. Holy shit there's a stalactite. I have to stalactite somebody right?
[3373.14s -> 3401.10s]  I got him. When you're like on a security job and one of your co-workers gets killed by a stalactite
[3401.10s -> 3417.99s]  you're not gonna you're gonna go investigate that. All right what is this? Fuse? Oh screwdriver thank

[3460.81s -> 3476.04s]  accident of the stalactite. These were sharp and small. Oh this person's coming to the generator.
[3476.04s -> 3490.18s]  Just slowly clear this whole remote. That'll make a ton of noise. I don't want to do that.
[3490.18s -> 3526.54s]  Let me uh let me piano wire this guy. Dude I'm gonna set these motherfuckers up. I'm gonna set
[3526.54s -> 3532.62s]  all five of these guys underneath the stalactite. So it's just like they were all sitting here
[3532.62s -> 3545.21s]  having a smoke break and this giant stalactite killed everybody. Perfect. A tactical shotgun?
[3545.21s -> 3598.02s]  Hell yeah. Yeah you've you've you found something. No one's turning the generator off. Only two more
[3598.02s -> 3634.95s]  people that's it. He's gonna hear the generator. Actually you know what? Fuck it. Some punk kid.
[3635.51s -> 3649.45s]  All right I've successfully infiltrated. Okay hold on. No one else is here right? Laptop files.
[3649.45s -> 3657.80s]  Crest wasn't planning to sell the control unit back to them at all. He was going to use the damn
[3657.80s -> 3674.70s]  thing. I suppose I was selling him short. Okay. Can I take the rack? Did I do it? Safety is on.
[3674.70s -> 3698.42s]  What do you mean safety's on? Oh let's go. With the control unit in pieces the satellite's no longer.
[3698.42s -> 3706.14s]  Let's go. That's one problem taken care of. All right hell yeah. Let me get some uh extra stuff
[3706.14s -> 3727.66s]  though. There's all kinds of like goodies here. All right not bad. Now I'm gonna go turn on the
[3727.66s -> 3741.67s]  bat signal. Anything else I can do? That's it. All right let's go. So from here I'm gonna go
[3742.79s -> 3752.17s]  drop disguise. Oh I'm gonna head this way. Get out of the cave. You need to kill the witnesses.
[3752.17s -> 3763.11s]  They're not gonna get up. Those other two people will be dead far before I have to do that. It's
[3763.11s -> 3770.63s]  not coming this way right? Yeah these guys have the two targets will be dead before they wake up.
[3770.63s -> 3775.19s]  And even if they do wake up. What you woke up in a cave and four people died by a stalactite. Does
[3775.19s -> 3783.61s]  that really matter? I'm gonna be fine. I need to get rid of this. Don't aim the fucking gun. Throw
[3783.61s -> 3792.68s]  it. How do I get rid of the gun? I don't want two guns on me at all times. Okay let's go do the bat
[3792.68s -> 3803.90s]  signal. Z? Okay that's fine. All right that's better. All right let's set up the meeting.
[3803.90s -> 3819.27s]  I should be allowed in here right? Aren't I like personal private security?
[3820.73s -> 3827.56s]  Please don't search me. All right you guys remember in the mask when they're like freeze and they
[3827.56s -> 3833.50s]  start going through his pants and there's rubber chickens and clocks. I this is a lot of stuff to
[3833.50s -> 3840.26s]  have to get rid of. I need to be a pirate. I have a pirate disguise literally right over. Okay well
[3840.26s -> 3863.99s]  I'm gonna go get it. Lock the hole in the sand castle? That seems just kind of set for. Let me
[3863.99s -> 3887.61s]  get the pirate costume. Okay I thought one of them got up. All right so now I should be able to get
[3887.61s -> 3904.52s]  in there. Why is that evil? All right that person can see through. Nobody else can right? No we're
[3904.52s -> 3938.89s]  good. All right we're here. I want to turn that thing on. We're good. Oh oops. Do you stay this
[3938.89s -> 3959.26s]  way or can you please turn? Fucking camera. Don't take my picture. It doesn't really matter. What

[3999.10s -> 4026.81s]  god. Can I get in there? Don't say that. Friend of yours. 47. Don't. Why would you say that? Mr. Smith.
[4026.81s -> 4036.02s]  47. Real thin ice with interval. This assignment was supposed to be a gimme. Tag along undercover
[4036.02s -> 4041.86s]  on some tankers. Monitor the crews for any suspicious contact with pirates and sportsmen
[4041.86s -> 4047.54s]  investigations with whatever info I found. Should have been a piece of cake. Do you need some help?
[4047.54s -> 4053.06s]  Yeah. Haven't heard any keys on their leader when she comes by. If I had to guess I'd say
[4053.06s -> 4056.82s]  she's keeping them somewhere private like an office. An office. If you can get those keys
[4056.82s -> 4063.74s]  and open this door I can get myself off this island. Got it. Okay. Turn up the volume. Okay.
[4064.30s -> 4075.42s]  Is that better? All right I need to find the keys. They're probably in an office. I don't
[4075.42s -> 4083.34s]  whatever this is I'm touching it. Turn that off. Turn it off. I don't know what I just did. Turn
[4083.34s -> 4088.76s]  it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. I'm sorry. I don't know what that does. I can't turn that off.
[4094.90s -> 4102.25s]  Did I fuck it up? I think I screwed it all up. I messed the whole thing up didn't I?
[4117.64s -> 4126.55s]  All right I gotta get I gotta knock these guys out and then use the printer or whatever that is.
[4147.62s -> 4152.87s]  Oh my god I have so much stupid bullshit in my inventory. I don't even I whatever.
[4154.31s -> 4163.64s]  I need something quiet. What's the quietest thing I have here? Probably a knife or this.
[4164.52s -> 4167.45s]  The fish is quiet. The fish is not quiet.
[4176.87s -> 4189.40s]  What does that do? I don't even need to be in here. Is there a key anywhere?
[4190.12s -> 4231.75s]  There's no key here. It's probably upstairs. I'm gonna stay over here right? Probably up here.
[4232.31s -> 4246.49s]  Oh shit. Okay let's go go go. What do we got? Notes. Intel. Rough accumulation of intel about
[4246.49s -> 4251.06s]  Crest and the militia in addition to because calculations about the value of the satellite
[4251.06s -> 4256.10s]  itself where notes outline what Crest stands to gain from blackmailing ether and their clients
[4256.10s -> 4270.06s]  with its data. Wow. There it is. Got the key. Holy shit this this thing is insane. Um throw this
[4270.06s -> 4286.34s]  out the window. I got the key. Was there anything else in here that I needed? I've got the key.
[4287.06s -> 4314.18s]  I'm gonna drop down. All right let's go. Now what? Who the hell are you and what were you doing on
[4314.18s -> 4320.60s]  that tanker? If you don't start talking I'll cut one of those ears of yours off. Whether or not
[4320.60s -> 4328.28s]  I know who to send it to. Hey you. What happened? Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.
[4328.92s -> 4338.30s]  Now all that's left to deal with. What did I do? Crest himself. I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.
[4341.51s -> 4370.07s]  Like I said Carbat. I fucking electrified everybody. I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[4370.63s -> 4376.73s]  Did you drop anything? An access hub? Key? Wait hold on. Open this door.
[4383.48s -> 4398.07s]  Are they coming in? No we're okay. Data entry and I don't know. Whatever. Go. Get out.
[4404.95s -> 4408.23s]  Fuck. No no no no no no no no no. I don't. I don't. I don't. Just come in and investigate.
[4408.23s -> 4415.56s]  Do whatever you need to do. Bye. Don't shoot him. Just run. I'm good. Save it. That is not how you're
[4415.56s -> 4462.79s]  supposed to do that. Okay so that leaves us with the bat signal. Kick bag of bricks? The signal's
[4462.79s -> 4488.71s]  lit. Their meeting should start soon. Am I gonna kick a bag of bricks on this guy? Here it comes.
[4488.71s -> 4492.79s]  That guy doesn't know the meeting got cancelled. He doesn't know that um that I killed like all
[4492.79s -> 4515.19s]  the people down here. He's no idea. This guy has absolutely no clue. Shit he's gone. What is this
[4515.19s -> 4527.66s]  guy doing up here? Did I get him? Okay okay okay okay. He's coming. He's on his way. Dude I could
[4527.66s -> 4574.98s]  probably just go like. I'll do it the right way. I'll do it the right way. I'll do it the right way.
[4574.98s -> 4608.15s]  Relax. So this just dropped down here. Did they actually even walk by this? Where's he going? Wait
[4608.15s -> 4621.66s]  where are all the dead bodies? They got rid of all the dead bodies. What distraction. This guy's not
[4621.66s -> 4675.78s]  up here is he? Oh there he goes. Is he leaving? Investigate that. How far can I throw something?
[4686.86s -> 4696.55s]  See what the hell that was. The meeting is not in the tower. That makes sense. You're right. Why
[4696.55s -> 4701.00s]  would the meeting be in the tower? You're right. Yeah that's weird. Oh well let's just kill
[4701.00s -> 4712.55s]  whoever this is. What was I thinking? I don't know. This seems like a secluded place.
[4715.37s -> 4722.01s]  Now fuck that. When Commissioner Gordon does the bat signal Batman goes to the bat signal on the
[4722.01s -> 4738.49s]  roof. That's how in every single movie. Every single tv show. I have a sword now. All right
[4738.49s -> 4752.41s]  whatever. I'm just gonna go kill him. Save it. Where is he? I'm gonna go slash this guy with
[4752.41s -> 4768.14s]  a sword. You know what I mean? Like who cares? Shit it went the wrong way. Come on. Really?
[4774.33s -> 4792.71s]  Metal worker? No. Oh hi. Hello. All right let's go this way. That's probably an escape route right
[4792.71s -> 4822.09s]  there. All right fuck this guy. I've had enough. I'll get him alone here. He goes around the corner.
[4822.09s -> 4832.63s]  When he goes around the corner I'll go for him. I mean this is way more. This is way more hilarious.
[4833.19s -> 4847.91s]  Quarter out of my pocket. Fuck off. What what's so weird about that? What did I lose? What are you
[4847.91s -> 4856.30s]  talking about? I took a oh actually thank you. I appreciate that. Usually people would just be
[4856.30s -> 4861.18s]  like you know don't give a shit about somebody dropping something. I really appreciate it. Thank
[4861.18s -> 4866.04s]  you. You thought I was gonna hit him in the face with the battle didn't you? I would have if it
[4866.04s -> 4881.22s]  said uh the text came up but it didn't. Stop. Just focus. Oh shit you wanted a coconut. What do I get
[4881.22s -> 4902.07s]  one? Where do you actually get a coconut? I want to do that. How do you actually get a coconut?
[4917.29s -> 4927.77s]  Or something. No. I wanted to hit him with the. I wanted to hit him with the with the pad. I want
[4927.77s -> 4934.01s]  to hit him with the board. I was waiting for. I don't know. Why can't I hit him with the board?
[4939.48s -> 4956.01s]  I'm about to just throw it at this guy and run. You know what I mean? I might as well.
[4956.01s -> 4961.98s]  The exit's probably right here. This is crass. What's your status?
[4967.88s -> 4974.52s]  I don't care anymore. Whatever. I genuinely don't care.
[4974.52s -> 4985.59s]  That's that. How do I get this guy alone? Enable your vaude. It should be there.
[4986.87s -> 4997.05s]  I don't. How do I get this guy alone? Shoot him from the tower. That's easier.
[4997.05s -> 5012.41s]  I was throwing a fucking knife in his head. That's crest taken care of.
[5012.41s -> 5017.91s]  And that's that. The rest will pick up the pieces. It's time to go 47.
[5017.91s -> 5023.80s]  We need to secure the area. I'll see you soon. For your own safety. Do you understand?
[5023.80s -> 5043.22s]  Don't head in the game. Get your head in the game. Anybody copy? No sign of any pub.
[5044.18s -> 5052.46s]  You're supposed to be guarding stuff you lazy prick. I had to do it. You know I did.
[5052.46s -> 5056.54s]  I had to do it. I had to do it. I had to do it. I had to do it. I don't care if I failed the mission.
[5056.54s -> 5060.62s]  I had to hit that guy in the face for the video because they're going to edit the video right
[5060.62s -> 5063.82s]  when I hit him in the face. It's going to cut to the next clip which is coming up here shortly.
[5063.82s -> 5087.11s]  That's crest taken care of. And that's that. The rest will pick up the pieces.
[5088.07s -> 5091.56s]  It's time to go 47. I'll see you soon.
[5112.66s -> 5113.46s]  That was scary.
[5150.82s -> 5154.42s]  Someone's fighting a gun. Help me. What? You're talking to me?
[5155.30s -> 5173.88s]  Wait. Wait. Are you asking me for help? I'm so confused what happened. I don't care. What was
[5173.88s -> 5208.10s]  that? 47. That was a Homer Simpson scream. All right. I got 20,000 XP and oh okay. Unfortunately,
[5208.10s -> 5228.46s]  unfortunately you got one star. Zero actually. That was kind of a fun mission. Oh all right.
[5228.46s -> 5250.10s]  Cool. That was kind of fun. New personal best. That's the first time I've ever played it. All
[5250.10s -> 5257.78s]  right. Was is there any? Is this the only DLC map or is that it? Are there any more DLC maps? I just
[5257.78s -> 5265.35s]  want to see what the sword looks like when you hit somebody with it. See you. That's
[5265.67s -> 5293.86s]  brutal. Okay. Is there any more? It's quick. It's very quick. Does it kill instantly? This is not
[5293.86s -> 5302.09s]  knocking people out, right? It's fast and it kills people. That's kind of crazy. All right. Well,
[5302.09s -> 5306.90s]  that's fun. Let me see. Anything else to do? Otherwise we'll play some multiverses. We'll
[5306.90s -> 5321.43s]  move to multiverses after this. Play the scary card game. I did. I played scary card game. Save
[5321.43s -> 5330.89s]  the guy, the people, people in the cage. It's over. I do art of wilds DLC. I probably will eventually.
[5331.66s -> 5336.94s]  But like I heard it was kind of a little too puzzle based. I heard I wouldn't be very bad at
[5336.94s -> 5343.38s]  it. I heard that I would not have fun playing it. That's what I was told. Fuck the plank of shame.
[5349.00s -> 5356.97s]  Art of wilds DLC. They lied to you. Okay. All right. Let's let's do multiverses. I'm ready to play.
[5356.97s -> 5363.85s]  I've been kind of obsessed with this game. This is also going to be a sponsor segment.
[5364.41s -> 5370.25s]  I've been playing this game a shitload on the couch sick on my xbox. I'm ready to game. That
[5370.25s -> 5377.29s]  was fun though. What about, so VOD is still private. Why? Why does twitch keep changing this
[5377.29s -> 5391.30s]  shit? It shouldn't be. Let's see. Hold on. Yeah. Why is this not published? I changed this setting.
[5391.30s -> 5399.69s]  I changed this setting like three days ago. What the hell? If I publish this right now,
[5399.69s -> 5415.88s]  will it actually go through? That's kind of annoying. Publish this. Okay. Is it there?
[5415.88s -> 5431.48s]  Please confirm with me that you can see it. I hope so. Yeah. I went into my settings and I
[5431.48s -> 5440.49s]  changed this already. This has already been changed. Where, what is it? What is it under?
[5440.49s -> 5452.17s]  Stream settings. Store path. Always publish VODs. Dude, I did this already. Why are you doing this
[5452.17s -> 5464.09s]  to me? Okay. That's whatever. All right. Let's do multiverses. Let's open it. I'm gonna do a quick
[5464.09s -> 5471.18s]  BRB for one second because I need to set up a chatbot and stuff. So give me one sec. Gonna be
[5471.18s -> 5476.31s]  playing a lot of LeBron. LeBron is really fun. Really good. I'll be right back.
