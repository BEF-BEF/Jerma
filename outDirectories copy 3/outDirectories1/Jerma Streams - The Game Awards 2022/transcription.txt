[3019.03s -> 3020.31s]  terrified
[3020.31s -> 3022.63s]  Of what happens when you awaken
[3023.51s -> 3024.87s]  What is this?
[3024.87s -> 3030.31s]  Dune i'd never seen dune. I've never seen the original guys. I don't like I don't take in any media
[3031.03s -> 3034.55s]  I just watched the same fold metal alchemist intro a thousand times and then go to bed

[3202.52s -> 3204.52s]  To see where the fun takes you next
[3206.53s -> 3210.61s]  Yes, you are consuming probably two to three hundred advertisements over the course of these two three hours
[3211.33s -> 3217.41s]  The whole thing isn't bad
[3221.09s -> 3226.85s]  When you order twelve dollars or more it's like oh the pornhub app. Oh, it's not so simple. It's so easy
[3228.07s -> 3230.07s]  I thought I was like why is this pornhub?
[3232.72s -> 3254.16s]  The pornhub app was this
[3263.51s -> 3265.69s]  I played this game on my ipad
[3267.35s -> 3269.35s]  Or I want to say
[3269.43s -> 3271.75s]  Two or three hours is pure freedom in this world

[3308.74s -> 3318.56s]  I was so overwhelmed

[3361.83s -> 3400.98s]  the death stranding
[3405.44s -> 3421.32s]  It's a strand type game
[3447.44s -> 3450.20s]  Why do I feel like kojima would make a game
[3450.96s -> 3454.08s]  That's just like a 500 million piece puzzle
[3454.88s -> 3458.87s]  And he just releases it. It's on like ps5 store for free
[3462.24s -> 3464.24s]  And everyone just has to do it at the same time
[3476.63s -> 3478.31s]  And when it's completed
[3478.31s -> 3505.59s]  It unlocks the trailer for this game and it might take 40 years for us to finish it. It's okay doxels 2
[3508.12s -> 3509.32s]  the worst one

[3621.33s -> 3632.05s]  Haki great to see you. Uh, well, mr. Kojima
[3632.05s -> 3636.69s]  It's been three years you're on this stage with us in 2019 where you won best game direction
[3637.25s -> 3642.21s]  Ds2 has been announced. Uh, what can you tell us? How is it going to be different than ds1?
[3642.61s -> 3644.61s]  Um
[3653.49s -> 3658.29s]  I can't really be specific right now, but you just seen the trailer and I put a lot of things inside
[3658.37s -> 3661.73s]  So I want you guys to talk about it and find details in it
[3663.01s -> 3665.01s]  Good luck. All right
[3665.01s -> 3670.13s]  Well, I know we have some of this is a 600 million piece puzzle on a qr code in there
[3670.29s -> 3674.77s]  You guys go find it. Um, troy is here as well. We heard him there. Hello troy
[3676.05s -> 3681.41s]  We're so excited about this collaboration you have with an amazing cast. I wanted to ask you the story of this game
[3681.81s -> 3685.09s]  How is the pandemic and what we've been through? How has that impacted your story telling?
[3685.17s -> 3687.33s]  That's the cube from peter. Mala nu. Yeah
[3697.57s -> 3702.93s]  Well, I had the story written before the pandemic but after experiment experiencing the pandemic
[3703.25s -> 3706.53s]  I just rewrote the whole thing. Uh the story from scratch
[3706.53s -> 3715.25s]  I also didn't want to predict any more future so I rewrote it
[3719.97s -> 3725.33s]  Hi, mr. Kojima, it's always such a pleasure having you here. I wanted to ask generally what's next for you as a creator
[3725.33s -> 3728.61s]  I know we have our fun podcast we do what else you've got planned. Okay
[3740.13s -> 3745.73s]  Well, yes, i'm doing the ds2 right now and also one other title that's completely new
[3745.81s -> 3752.61s]  I'm kind of experimenting at the moment and also other visual projects. I'm still working on so i'll hope to reveal it soon
[3753.41s -> 3757.89s]  Trans translating very prolific. It's such a it's such a skill everyone
[3759.09s -> 3761.09s]  I'm thinking about this right now
[3761.41s -> 3763.57s]  If you told if you told me in english
[3764.61s -> 3766.77s]  Four or five full sentences and said say it again
[3767.41s -> 3773.01s]  I'd go we're proud to announce a new game. Hey, what the fuck did you even say a new triple a independent studio be like you
[3773.49s -> 3779.01s]  Studios I can't experience making story hard to do fps games like dead space halo and bioshock
[3779.25s -> 3784.37s]  They partnered with ea originals label be label behind last year's game of the year winner. I'll try it takes two
[3784.53s -> 3791.41s]  Okay, i'll try a single player magic shooter from now ready original world right now. Here is your first glimpse
[3792.74s -> 3794.74s]  there's something here is a
[3796.13s -> 3805.62s]  A new pair of shoes. What did he say? Here is a new thing to uh present. I don't know. I don't remember a good one
[3816.95s -> 3830.64s]  I'll try it after
[3835.44s -> 3840.47s]  You help us win this i'll know you're ready
[3841.91s -> 3846.58s]  But didn't they just say you can't win you don't win here if you help us win
[3847.86s -> 3867.33s]  Did I miss that?
[3867.33s -> 3868.69s]  Okay, i'm gonna try
[3868.69s -> 3876.45s]  I'm gonna try to say what what actor who recently performed in midnight mass and ghostbusters spirits unleashed when he's welcome
[3876.77s -> 3878.77s]  When jeff is back on stage
[3878.77s -> 3880.77s]  I will try to do it
[3880.85s -> 3887.97s]  I will try as an actor i'm drawn towards stories, but I think that's true of all of us, especially those who pick up a controller
[3888.53s -> 3892.53s]  Narrative in games is a slippery thing because there's no single way to tell a story
[3893.01s -> 3896.29s]  The beginning middle and end may not even happen in that order
[3896.93s -> 3899.41s]  And for each of us there may be different outcomes altogether
[3899.89s -> 3905.33s]  But to be truly invested in a game story is to step away and feel as if you've lived another life
[3905.97s -> 3908.13s]  These are the nominees for best narrative
[3910.29s -> 3916.69s]  Best narrative hugo was always worried that it would start all over again. She doesn't have this
[3917.41s -> 3919.41s]  the golden order is
[3928.42s -> 3930.42s]  Things are falling apart
[3934.98s -> 3938.50s]  This game was fucking crazy, I forgot to talk to you guys about this it should be that one

[3946.10s -> 3948.10s]  god of war ragnarok
[3948.34s -> 3956.00s]  Immortality was actually a crazy experience. I forgot to tell you about it. It actually was a really
[3956.78s -> 3958.78s]  terrifying strange
[3958.80s -> 3960.08s]  weird
[3960.08s -> 3963.20s]  Wild experience. I forgot to tell you about it. Whatever it lost
[3964.08s -> 3975.64s]  Why didn't you stream it? I don't know because I
[3976.98s -> 3979.27s]  I felt like just sitting on the couch
[3979.27s -> 3984.39s]  Put a camera on your couch there are so many people a lot of them over there who should be on this stage with
[3984.39s -> 3985.91s]  Me right now
[3985.91s -> 3993.49s]  Um so much goes into the telling of a story. I screamed at you. I'm sorry by the way from writers animators

[4165.57s -> 4167.57s]  And
[4167.81s -> 4171.73s]  You would accidentally chain three or four moves together and your friend would go dude
[4172.45s -> 4174.85s]  That was pretty good. You're like, yeah, I know
[4176.05s -> 4178.05s]  I know I play

[6345.46s -> 6351.55s]  for the war for the darkness

[6514.85s -> 6516.85s]  Loading memory cord now
[6523.98s -> 6528.14s]  Every day it seems we're wasting away
[6545.58s -> 6549.58s]  I want to make a game called constant conflict and even in the safe hub world
[6549.82s -> 6554.94s]  Just people just run around attacking each other and like fireballs going off and like cars crashing into stuff
[6565.58s -> 6572.94s]  Transformers

[6665.70s -> 6667.70s]  I thought it was a movie or a tv show or something
[6676.31s -> 6678.31s]  the strength of your resolve
[6679.11s -> 6681.35s]  Is the only thing that will grant you another day

[6774.87s -> 6776.87s]  And you walking into walls
[6780.04s -> 6784.68s]  Celebrating styles curl up by the fire and play fall guys for a while
[6787.28s -> 6793.12s]  He's the voice of toad in the upcoming. They also didn't show the the character going like this every five seconds

[6829.11s -> 6830.39s]  You would be right

[6833.43s -> 6835.35s]  Saying that it's a hat
[6835.35s -> 6838.95s]  And and you know what? It's not a hat. It's a cap
[6840.68s -> 6847.00s]  You see because the cap is that top part of the mushroom that houses the spores in everything
[6847.56s -> 6849.56s]  and also a cap
[6851.41s -> 6853.41s]  Is another word for hat. I
[6854.71s -> 6858.87s]  See how that okay. I just right now saw how that could be confusing. Um
[6860.07s -> 6861.59s]  Wow

[10044.22s -> 10045.98s]  probably
[10045.98s -> 10048.22s]  I mean, I don't think an experience will come out for a while
[10049.02s -> 10051.02s]  I can match that
[10060.30s -> 10062.30s]  A lot of good things did come out this year though
[10068.46s -> 10074.38s]  We have faced so many difficulties while developing this game so as a director i'm really relieved
[10075.26s -> 10077.58s]  And this might not be the you know light thing to say
[10078.06s -> 10080.30s]  at the you know, the on occasion of the
[10081.10s -> 10088.78s]  Receiving the goatee award, but I haven't made up my mind to create even more interesting games than this one
[10093.02s -> 10096.86s]  I mean it's
[10106.11s -> 10110.59s]  As for elderling we still have several more things we want to do

[10199.31s -> 10203.07s]  The vet believed in congratulations. This has been such a special night
[10203.15s -> 10207.87s]  And I can't believe what is happening that next year 2023 marks the 10th annual game awards
[10208.11s -> 10210.11s]  So we are lucky to do this every year
[10210.11s -> 10215.63s]  And we want to thank all the industry for their support and of course all of you around the world viewers of the show tonight
[10215.71s -> 10219.79s]  I do have one last special announcement from us to celebrate our 10th year
[10220.03s -> 10225.79s]  The game awards is thrilled to be partnering with the la phil for a very special evening of video game music
[10225.95s -> 10231.23s]  Performed live at the world famous hollywood bowl next year on june 25th
[10232.09s -> 10237.47s]  2023 we'll be celebrating the past decade of video game music and looking ahead to its future
[10237.87s -> 10244.43s]  Let's go hearing much more about this historic collaboration early next year until then. Thank you so much
[10244.51s -> 10250.75s]  Have a safe and happy holiday season and we'll see you in 2023. Good night everybody. Very cool
[10252.11s -> 10254.11s]  I need to examine something really quickly though
[10254.35s -> 10256.03s]  I mean my internet's a piece of shit right now
[10256.03s -> 10260.75s]  But I need to I need to see just how bad this was if I allow it into the awards, which i'm not going to
[10262.68s -> 10264.76s]  I'm not going to but I need to see how bad it was
[10265.56s -> 10277.34s]  You have to allow it. No, I can't I can't do that
[10278.96s -> 10282.38s]  All right. This is pretty cool stuff this year. First of all vampire survivors
[10282.54s -> 10287.26s]  I think is probably top three in game of the year. I think wait. What did I even say?
[10287.58s -> 10311.77s]  You're a man of your word. What did I say? Wait, let me I gotta put it on stream. Let's examine this
[10313.45s -> 10319.05s]  Goosebumps, okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna go away for a second
[10321.15s -> 10323.15s]  That was scary
[10324.11s -> 10326.33s]  Scary
[10326.33s -> 10331.05s]  You can see i'm getting ready to press the button. This is this motherfucker right here
[10331.53s -> 10335.77s]  Is about to press the fart button and that now those are i'm pressing the fart button eyes
[10338.96s -> 10343.82s]  I told you game of the year
[10343.90s -> 10345.90s]  winner is
[10346.30s -> 10348.60s]  Elder
[10350.36s -> 10355.29s]  They won
[10355.37s -> 10357.69s]  Okay, the fact the fact that it was
[10358.49s -> 10363.77s]  The fact that it was that one. I couldn't even hear it. Everything was so loud
[10364.17s -> 10366.57s]  I just I just clicked on the first one
[10367.29s -> 10371.07s]  Fart sound effect. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. That was naughty
[10376.72s -> 10383.36s]  They won they did it i'm sorry I can't put it in like I can't put it in the awards
[10385.92s -> 10388.35s]  I'm sorry
[10392.27s -> 10394.27s]  Why would somebody do that?
[10395.69s -> 10398.73s]  Imagine you're watching this with a bunch of friends
[10399.37s -> 10400.65s]  You're in
[10400.65s -> 10402.65s]  You're like five or six you're on the couch
[10403.45s -> 10408.97s]  And one of your friends is just like dude. Ah, man, if elden ring wins, i'll shit my pants
[10410.09s -> 10412.57s]  That's so funny. You're such a goofy guy
[10412.81s -> 10419.44s]  Yeah, you're so what a character that guy is and then the announcement of elden ring happens and this motherfucker does this
[10421.20s -> 10423.50s]  Elden ring
[10440.19s -> 10444.27s]  Well that was the game awards but I do have to tell you who I think should have won
[10444.67s -> 10447.71s]  Right. You're a coward. It's fecal funny. I
[10453.58s -> 10463.66s]  It's so childish and it's not it's so it's such a basic joke to make too. Anyways, so oh, I think that um
[10464.70s -> 10469.18s]  Vampire survivors was a good game this year. I also think that elden ring was better
[10469.82s -> 10478.75s]  One or two, I think yeah, how do I what do I even do for how do I go from here elden ring vampire survivors?
[10478.99s -> 10504.67s]  What else did I say? It was three scorn didn't win anything. Yeah, I know my internet's a mess right now
[10507.16s -> 10510.20s]  But thanks for watching that. I'm sorry. I was I was late. I've been doing a lot of shit
[10510.28s -> 10516.43s]  There's a lot of stuff going on. I will see you this weekend. Maybe just follow my twitter
[10516.75s -> 10522.84s]  I would follow the twitter if you don't grotto beast is so close christmas show is coming here
[10523.46s -> 10526.44s]  17th of december is going to be great. There's a lot going on
[10527.00s -> 10534.28s]  Um and working a lot and trying to get some of this stuff ready poll for the award show
[10534.92s -> 10539.02s]  Will be live tonight. So if you want to vote on that there's a lot
[10539.80s -> 10541.61s]  I will say that
[10541.61s -> 10547.31s]  Um, it's always funny to go through the nominees and uh, cause like and huge shout out to the mods too the mods
[10547.79s -> 10549.23s]  Did so much
[10549.23s -> 10555.31s]  This there was so many submissions and then obviously me going through them too did you know have to narrow them down
[10555.87s -> 10556.59s]  but
[10556.59s -> 10564.22s]  It's always funny to do these because when you do when you have something like best impression and worst impression the best impression category had
[10564.86s -> 10566.97s]  you know
[10566.97s -> 10571.08s]  10 to 15 nominees the worst impression category had like
[10571.85s -> 10573.60s]  110
[10573.60s -> 10576.88s]  After you know the first few passes so trying to
[10578.46s -> 10585.80s]  Worst noise I think had like 70 nominees even after going through it a few times, but it's in a place
[10587.32s -> 10589.32s]  Where we're it looks pretty good
[10589.56s -> 10594.54s]  So you'll see it take your time on it. You've got eight or nine days ten days
[10594.62s -> 10601.69s]  Which just doesn't sound like a lot of time because it's not i'll see you soon. Thanks for watching. I'm gonna go
[10601.85s -> 10604.33s]  I know my internet sucks. I I was thinking about
[10604.89s -> 10608.97s]  Changing over to like frog detective, but it's it's a mess right now past 7 38 o'clock
[10609.29s -> 10624.97s]  So I've been streaming earlier. But yeah, I will see you next time. You will see me will be this weekend. I'll see you
[10625.53s -> 10626.88s]  You'll see
[10626.88s -> 10632.89s]  Um, i'm sure you'll see it. It'll probably get announced soon. Maybe i'll announce it on twitter follow the twitter
[10633.21s -> 10641.39s]  If you don't follow my twitter or um, you know, just when I go live tweets and sponsor ads
[10643.58s -> 10645.34s]  Sometimes I read my drafts
[10645.34s -> 10649.20s]  So that's good
[10649.20s -> 10651.60s]  All right. Uh
[10651.60s -> 10657.13s]  So let me let's raid let's raid somebody who we're raiding. Let me see who's live. Thanks for watching though
