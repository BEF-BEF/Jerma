[1.91s -> 10.63s]  Uh, I have a question. How do you, um, how do you do, like, the pointing emoji on PC?
[10.63s -> 15.58s]  Like, if I wanted to do, what, can somebody just do it so I can just copy it?
[15.58s -> 22.31s]  What's the, like, pointing, pointing, like a finger pointing? Yes. Yeah, there you go.
[22.31s -> 42.09s]  Thank you. All right, I'll be back. I, I apparently didn't copy it. How come I didn't copy it?
[42.09s -> 50.49s]  It's, oh, that's, it's a, well, hold on. It's because of BTTV emote. That's a middle finger.
[50.49s -> 54.49s]  I need, like, a, the pointing finger that's not from BTTV because I need to put it in the,
[54.49s -> 68.17s]  I'm gonna put it in the title. Do Windows plus, I'm not gonna have to do that. Windows plus
[68.17s -> 72.94s]  for an emoji. How do I, does anybody, can somebody just write it so I can do it?
[72.94s -> 77.78s]  Oh, there you go. Thank you. There you go. There, there it is. That's what I want. Thank you.
[77.78s -> 95.40s]  All right. Appreciate it. This title is so bad. Actually, I like it. I actually like this title.
[113.42s -> 118.58s]  See, okay. Wait, why did you, you already put the, what, did you put the pointing thing in already?
[118.58s -> 130.09s]  What do you mean Neopets? What are you talking about? Why are you guys saying Neopets?
[133.83s -> 136.15s]  This has nothing to do with what I'm doing. All right. I'll be back. I'll be right back.
[136.15s -> 624.70s]  All right. I'm actually going BRB. Okay. I had to get my tweet ready. I forgot about it.
[624.70s -> 655.66s]  Are we all ready? Getting there. Very cool. I'm going to do my tweet. There it is. All right.
[655.66s -> 663.13s]  Let me just capture the game. That's important. Oh, I got to do my, hold on. This is important too.
[663.13s -> 675.94s]  Let me get this out of the way because I need to make sure my webcam is not going to freak out.
[688.98s -> 708.63s]  All right. So we're going to do co-op. Let's see. Talk to the people here. All right. I'm going to
[708.63s -> 718.36s]  say, all right. That's how you know it's about to start when I say, all right. But seriously though.
[718.36s -> 740.54s]  All right. The switch is not available right now. Turn that off. Turn this off. Okay. I'm ready to
[740.54s -> 765.21s]  play Gotham Knights. I had to pee. Okay. Your title still says Zelda. That's changing. Now I
[773.14s -> 784.23s]  got to plug this in. That is changing very shortly. No, it doesn't. You just gaslit me so bad,
[784.23s -> 796.95s]  didn't you? All righty. All righty. All righty. All righty. Jesus Christ, man. All right. I got
[796.95s -> 817.34s]  to think some more filler words than just, okay. All right. All right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.
[817.34s -> 830.23s]  The last thing I was playing is Batgirl, but I was, I was hit up by a one son. He said, hey,
[830.23s -> 840.46s]  I think, I think we need to do some co-op stuff with the campaign. I was like, huh? Oh, let's call
[840.46s -> 856.28s]  him. See if he's available. Hey, what's up? Oh, I can't hear you. Hold on.
[859.48s -> 873.34s]  I don't know what he's saying. I can't hear him. Have you played this game at all?
[875.51s -> 880.33s]  Oh yeah. I've been playing for like three days. Have you done the tutorial? You might
[880.33s -> 887.54s]  have to do the tutorial. Yeah, I'll carry it. Just once you can do multiplayer, we'll uh,
[887.62s -> 891.06s]  just give me, give me a ping. This is like, this is a classic. Another,
[891.06s -> 895.46s]  yet another classic goof and gaff session where John carries me through. Hey dude,
[895.46s -> 899.94s]  are you ready to goof off? It's going to be so fun. I'm going to goof off. I'm goofy. I'm
[899.94s -> 903.62s]  goofy with it. Okay. I'm going to finish this video first. All right. Get, get, get out of here
[903.62s -> 918.15s]  and do the tutorial for God's sake. Okay. I got to put him through a different, yeah. Hold on.
[918.15s -> 927.10s]  Uh, hold on. All right. I'm muted there. Let me, uh, I could have changed this. We'll play as a
[927.10s -> 932.73s]  backer for a little bit and then he's ready. We'll go from there. We're going to goof off.
[932.73s -> 938.42s]  It's going to be goofy. All right. So my input is fine, but the output is the problem, the output,
[938.42s -> 946.47s]  because he's come through the wrong thing. I wonder if that's going to be better. We'll test it when
[946.47s -> 952.26s]  he gets back. And yeah, I know my webcam is freaking out. There's nothing I can do about it.
[952.90s -> 966.31s]  So, but I, it does, wait, it says, it says I'm playing as Robin. Oh, that's bad. I am, this is
[966.31s -> 978.39s]  not Robin. Wait a minute. We're not even on the same, we're not even on the same mission. They're
[978.39s -> 999.83s]  not even close. Is he going to be level one? Hey, can we ride the car together? But anyways,
[999.83s -> 1005.03s]  we're about, we're about to start. At least I am. Welcome everybody. This is a sponsored stream.
[1005.03s -> 1011.83s]  Gotham Knights is currently out now. It's for the Xbox Series S, the Xbox X, the PC, the,
[1011.83s -> 1016.15s]  what did I just say? The PlayStation 5. It's got co-op. We're going to show that today. This is
[1016.23s -> 1025.35s]  Batgirl. You're going to see Robin. Open world, Batman like game. All right. So let me do this
[1025.35s -> 1044.90s]  mission. Dude, you got to really lean into it. Turn around. How would I turn around? You need
[1044.90s -> 1052.82s]  your overlay. You guys are just on point. You really are. Where am I going to go? Down here,
[1052.82s -> 1065.03s]  right? Yeah. Yeah. I got an image panel. There's a panel down below. If you click it, it will take
[1065.03s -> 1070.76s]  you to the opportunity for you to buy Gotham Knights. Why does it want me to turn around?
[1070.76s -> 1085.70s]  It's over here. Yeah. Thanks Warner Brothers for sponsoring this segment of today's stream.
[1086.42s -> 1098.65s]  I'm going to switch to Robin. I promise. Batgirl, I'm leaving. What? What did that person say?
[1099.45s -> 1112.78s]  All right. Did I actually have to go the other way? Shut up. What are they talking about? All
[1112.78s -> 1127.54s]  right. Hold on. I need to go. Who is he talking to? Somebody did something that exploded. Um,
[1128.26s -> 1154.41s]  excuse me. What's with that fucking in menu BM bullshit? All right. I'm out of here. Batgirl,
[1154.49s -> 1165.34s]  I'm leaving because I'm not playing as Robin. What is going on here? Is that her? What was it?
[1165.34s -> 1177.78s]  What? No, I'm locked into the mission. I'm already locked into the mission. Don't throw stuff into
[1177.78s -> 1189.59s]  cars. Idiot. Did I go on that bridge this way and I'm coming back on this bridge that way?
[1191.18s -> 1237.54s]  I'm doing it my way. Okay. So there he is. Let's see what's going on here. Colonel Kane. Who's that?
[1237.54s -> 1243.83s]  Sergeant Pennyworth. Why are you wearing? Why is he wearing a Catwoman suit? I'm not. I had to
[1243.83s -> 1249.74s]  push our meeting so late. Work never seems to stop in this city. Oh, I can certainly relate.
[1250.62s -> 1262.94s]  The paperwork hasn't let up since Bruce's passing. I still can't believe it. Burying Bruce was the
[1262.94s -> 1271.10s]  hardest thing I've ever done. Yeah. Do you remember what I mean? I'm just Robin after Tommy. I was
[1271.10s -> 1280.50s]  just close to it. So I want to get it done. You said life matters when death matters. We take the
[1280.50s -> 1286.89s]  living for granted until they're gone. What settings am I on? What the Wayne Foundation will
[1286.89s -> 1296.73s]  do without Bruce? I'm on so I'm gonna have a 3090 and I have a 1440p resolution. Master Grayson. 60
[1296.73s -> 1305.46s]  fps frame rate I think. Yeah. Dick had his first investor call the other day. I'm surprised. I do
[1305.46s -> 1311.14s]  get a little bit of stuttering. I find you geezers escape from the old folks. Don't you know what's
[1311.46s -> 1321.53s]  going on? Every day I find new reasons to be proud. Empty your pockets or empty the gun.
[1322.17s -> 1341.26s]  We're gonna get like an Alfred moment here where he's like, you know what? Never mind. Oh, um,
[1342.14s -> 1352.63s]  quite the about face. That punk didn't know who he was messing with. Wow. Holy shit. Have a drink.
[1352.63s -> 1359.67s]  Catch up. Don't have to twist my arm. Let's not be long though. Isn't that girl supposed to be in
[1359.67s -> 1383.77s]  this cut scene? Oh, I was observing the cut scene from up. I actually think Batgirl might be.
[1385.29s -> 1392.09s]  Well, I can't say that until I play Robin. Let's change to Robin.
[1393.72s -> 1409.03s]  Robin time. Do you have concealer on? No, I don't have concealer on. It's a face smoothing filter
[1409.03s -> 1418.10s]  that I have turned on. Robin, you guys ready? I'm the only person on Twitch playing this game
[1418.10s -> 1439.03s]  with Robin, I think. Here we go. The title is now accurate. Stealth specialist, tactical genius,
[1439.03s -> 1450.82s]  bow staff prodigy. All right. What does Robin got for moves? We're gonna do the gears first.
[1450.82s -> 1469.69s]  All right. I got my suit. I actually cool. Whoa. This is Robin's suit in and beyond. I mean,
[1469.69s -> 1475.66s]  this thing, I kind of want to, I kind of want to be in this because I, when I look at this picture,
[1475.66s -> 1489.30s]  it's like, okay, that's, that's Robin. I guess that's so I love it. Ooh, he's got a slingshot.
[1489.30s -> 1498.76s]  Are you shitting me? All right. I, I'm very curious now. I'm the only person on Twitch
[1498.76s -> 1509.94s]  playing with Robin. Slugger, shadow or tinkering. Robin produces no sound while running and moves
[1509.94s -> 1522.01s]  faster. Okay. Uh, perfectly timed dodge. That's kind of good. 20% more damage when attacking from
[1522.01s -> 1529.34s]  behind. 20% more crit damage. Robin's decoy inflicts a large amount of, is it decoy? What's
[1529.34s -> 1542.81s]  this thing? Should I be stealth? Stealth, Steven? Don't do the ghost pepper challenge. Uh, I think
[1542.81s -> 1552.87s]  I'm going for slugger. I like doing damage. You know what I mean? 10% crit chance. Yeah.
[1552.87s -> 1559.64s]  Decoy. Yeah. I'm just going full slugger. All right. Let's check out his move set.
[1560.28s -> 1579.29s]  Jerma chat is unhinged. Uh, they'll be all right. They'll settle down. They'll be all right. They
[1579.29s -> 1589.06s]  settle after a little while. I'm actually kind of looking forward to, uh, getting in a game with
[1589.06s -> 1597.83s]  Hassan and him kind of his reaction to this character. He's going to be like, who are you
[1597.83s -> 1602.46s]  playing as? I'm going to be like, oh, of course that's bald boy. You know, Hassan, you don't know
[1602.46s -> 1612.58s]  who fucking bald boy is. Do you even watch the TV shows or movies? Ooh, what is this? Like little
[1613.69s -> 1631.75s]  throws rocks. All right. Let's give it a try. I need to make the fast travel thing. Don't I?
[1641.91s -> 1648.23s]  Honestly, I feel like this is, I feel like I'm traversing more ground than I do with the bike.
[1651.24s -> 1656.74s]  You can just fly around the city like this. Okay. So it's over here.
[1657.46s -> 1663.54s]  So this is the powers club. This is the culmination of the last thing we did last night.
[1664.26s -> 1688.47s]  Let's go. Let's kick some ass. Wait, I have a stealth specialist, aren't I? I'm inside. Good.
[1688.47s -> 1699.86s]  Be careful and let us know what you find spotted a patrol. Level seven. Oh, I might be too love with
[1699.86s -> 1725.94s]  this. Nobody can see. Oh God. Maybe you can. You look over at us in this. Holy shit. That'd be
[1725.94s -> 1733.99s]  terrifying. You know what? Why don't, why doesn't everybody just wear a superhero costume? If I
[1733.99s -> 1738.63s]  lived in this universe, I feel like less people would fuck with you. If I lived in any of these
[1738.63s -> 1743.54s]  superhero universes and I didn't have powers, I would put a costume on and just walk around and
[1743.54s -> 1748.02s]  shit. Did I go to the grocery store? I feel like people would be like, Oh, you're not like a regular
[1748.02s -> 1755.06s]  guy. You might, you're like fucking burp man or something. Right. Who knows? Like I feel like that
[1755.06s -> 1758.26s]  you'd, I feel like I'd be less inclined to like, Oh, I'm going to sneak up behind this guy and
[1758.26s -> 1763.86s]  stealth kill him. If this guy was in like a bright green spandex suit with like a pair of goggles on,
[1763.86s -> 1768.23s]  I'd be like, Oh fuck, I got to be careful. Right. Why don't they just wear costumes?
[1768.79s -> 1784.81s]  Okay. Let's scan the area. Oh, blood. AR shows a clear trail of blood. Wonder if there's anything
[1784.81s -> 1793.88s]  else to see. There's something hidden under the floor. The hatch is wired to a network.
[1794.52s -> 1805.11s]  There must be some way to activate it through the lamp. Okay. This way, but the light switch on the
[1805.11s -> 1814.97s]  lamp. Yeah. You could just make up what your powers were. Right. Okay. Somebody was like,
[1815.53s -> 1818.97s]  who the heck are you, man? I've never seen you around here. You're the superhero. I'd be like,
[1818.97s -> 1825.88s]  that's right. By the way, if I look at you and I decide you'll instantly die, I feel like people
[1825.88s -> 1833.29s]  would be like, Holy fuck me and get away from me. I'm instant die Reno. Right. No one would fuck with
[1833.29s -> 1839.96s]  you. And I would hire actors to like come and come after me and I would look at them and they would
[1839.96s -> 1850.12s]  just drop down. So people wouldn't be able to prove I couldn't do it. They said we'd be working
[1850.12s -> 1859.69s]  at a club. This isn't exactly what I had. Remain undetected. Just saying. I was hoping for something
[1859.69s -> 1865.70s]  a little more clubby and a little less creepy. Shut up. It's easy money. We barely have to see
[1865.70s -> 1872.18s]  the snobs anyway. Yeah. What the hell is that about? Who cares? The less we know, the better.
[1872.18s -> 1906.94s]  Looks like shit. I haven't been detected yet. I haven't been detected yet. Get out. Okay. I'm good.
[1906.94s -> 1955.10s]  This one right here. You're aiming at a wall, dude. Don't have a fuck with bug boy. Robin school's
[1955.10s -> 1991.13s]  character in the fucking game. I'm the only one playing him. No, Robin's my character. Oh shit.
[1991.13s -> 2004.10s]  Right in the head. Hey, dude. Oh, right in the eye. Is this dangerous or am I just annoying?
[2007.32s -> 2010.60s]  I think everyone right now is not doing anything because they're like, holy shit. Wait a minute.
[2010.60s -> 2014.36s]  This might, I don't think this is like a grown up. This is like a kid in this awesome outfit.
[2036.89s -> 2046.01s]  Ooh, that's cool. Bo staff. Okay. This is not just a Bo staff. This is an extendable Bo staff.
[2052.57s -> 2069.69s]  It's a telescopic telescopic Bo staff. Find a way. Okay. Flip the switch. Let's go. All right.
[2069.69s -> 2078.55s]  Well, it's right there. Okay. Hidden in plain sight. Press the button. Oh, I can press it.
[2079.27s -> 2105.83s]  Can I get in there? How do I get down there? Oh, there it is. Cool. I'm just, I just want
[2105.83s -> 2111.51s]  all of a sudden to turn the corner and you just hear. Ranger. Oh Robin, you think you're such a
[2111.51s -> 2124.47s]  smarty. Well, I don't think you're going to be so smart after you deal with me. Okay. Follow the
[2124.47s -> 2135.53s]  wires now. Where do they go now? Oh shit. I was too busy like talking. I missed it. I missed it. I
[2135.53s -> 2149.35s]  was talking. I'm an idiot. Find a way to follow the activated wires. I mean, was it part of the
[2149.35s -> 2162.95s]  bust? Where was it? It's not that thing down there, right? Connected to electric. No. Back of the
[2162.95s -> 2187.80s]  bust. I just was in my own world. Where are they going? Oh, come on. All right. Follow the wire.
[2187.80s -> 2216.01s]  The wire goes here and then it stops though. I mean, the activated wire is going down there.
[2217.77s -> 2234.81s]  Should I try to go down? No. Uh, is he for real? Oh, I thought, okay. I'm sorry. That's my bad. I
[2234.81s -> 2239.85s]  thought I had to like follow it. It's not like, oh, I thought it was, you know what I mean? Whatever.
[2239.85s -> 2250.81s]  Nice brain. Yeah. What, what did you get in science? Probably a C. I got a D. So I don't care.
[2260.87s -> 2265.51s]  You got a B. What's this weird labyrinth?
[2277.61s -> 2292.26s]  What's down here? Okay. All the blood trail. Where am I? The blood stops at the wall.
[2292.82s -> 2300.89s]  Weird. That's weird. Well, obvious way through here. There has to be more to this. Yep. Right
[2300.89s -> 2316.01s]  there. Nope. That's a light spotlight. All right. Turn it on. Okay. That did something.
[2323.53s -> 2333.85s]  Oh shit. God damn it. The shadow puzzle. Uh, what am I trying to make? Probably the fountain,
[2333.85s -> 2359.75s]  right? Am I trying to make the thing that's on the wall? Is that an eagle? That looks correct.
[2359.75s -> 2378.87s]  So now I got to do the body, which is down here. One more. That should be it. All right. That's not
[2378.87s -> 2418.60s]  it. That's not it. Almost. Was it this wing here? I feel like this could be accurate any way this
[2418.60s -> 2441.53s]  could be, right? Depends. It's like that different angle. Why did they not do that before? Let's get
[2441.53s -> 2475.03s]  the shit out of me. Oh, it's the owls. You are. Yep. What was that? Holy shit. You do like a,
[2475.03s -> 2497.37s]  you do a decoy. That's cool. That's what I'm saying. If you're the penguin and you talk,
[2497.37s -> 2501.61s]  you're tell, your penguin tells the truth. If you say you're the penguin, you are being serious.
[2502.57s -> 2516.46s]  By the way, for people that can do this in real life, how, how do you do that? It doesn't even
[2516.46s -> 2523.91s]  make any fucking sense that a human being can do that. People can do this shit. People can do that.
[2528.63s -> 2536.55s]  All right. Look at the blood trail. I can because I'm not a weak ass motherfucker.
[2536.55s -> 2548.66s]  Let's see how deep this goes. All right. Guess I just follow the blood then. Not gross at all.
[2561.99s -> 2568.15s]  So many things we could have done. His death has cleared the way for our new acquisition.
[2568.15s -> 2572.95s]  Good. However, do try to be careful where you're looking.
[2578.57s -> 2582.81s]  We've already brought the senators. I've been assured your bill will pass in the next month.
[2588.25s -> 2606.79s]  What is going on with that dog? I'm sorry. Turn it up. I can't move the camera. I want to get
[2606.79s -> 2631.16s]  a close up of the dog's face. I can't zoom in. No, you can't. Hold on. Can I just, what about if
[2631.16s -> 2652.49s]  I didn't crop everybody out in a frame? Okay. That's pretty good. I like that. I should let
[2652.49s -> 2690.36s]  a film grain do it. I can't change the lighting. That's all I can do. Okay. I got it. I guess I
[2690.36s -> 2698.23s]  have no other choice but to go through them. No one gets through. The ceremony can't be delayed.
[2698.23s -> 2702.58s]  You don't need to tell me that twice. This is our chance to impress the voice.
[2703.46s -> 2707.43s]  He'll be intruders first. Then you can think about the rewards. Oops.
[2714.31s -> 2719.64s]  Wrong fucking way. Whatever. I guess I technically could run away and then hide.
[2729.54s -> 2767.30s]  Resilient takedowns. It counts. That was fucking awful. Oh my God. What a horrible way to go.
[2768.18s -> 2791.06s]  I don't even feel like there should be something like the mask sound effects whenever you move
[2791.06s -> 2820.94s]  around like this. Like, I need one more silent takedown. Don't ever do that again. I mean,
[2820.94s -> 2833.58s]  I saw a lot of plus twos on that one. I don't know. Should I do it again? See ya.
[2839.22s -> 2846.01s]  Oh, watch this. We're gonna take this guy out like this. I'm gonna meat grind this motherfucker.
[2846.65s -> 2888.34s]  I missed this backswing with it. That's good. Oh, right in the head. Really? There's more?
[2889.54s -> 2923.03s]  Shit. So bad. Oh, I like that move. It bent the staff. I hit them so hard in the head.
[2923.67s -> 2932.44s]  I bent the staff around that person's head. This is a lot of blood. More than most people can spare.
[2933.24s -> 2941.16s]  He's easy, Robin. Jeez, Robin. I mean, I know you took out like 10 people, but
[2941.80s -> 2969.70s]  pull back a little here. Oh, I hear someone. He's still alive. Who's this?
[2970.10s -> 2979.58s]  Come on. Look out. We're hit me. I'm in the enemy's back. It won't happen again.
[2989.05s -> 2995.13s]  Death to the traitor. And death to also that guy.
[2997.77s -> 3005.93s]  The guy, the metal bald guy too, I guess. The voice of the court comes. He will dictate the
[3005.93s -> 3018.23s]  punishment. I don't know who that is, but death to you. Who is this?
[3018.23s -> 3032.39s]  The court cannot forgive your failure. You will atone with blood. Owl man?
[3036.17s -> 3043.59s]  And you, Vernon, do not belong here. The last time an intruder set foot here was more than a
[3043.59s -> 3049.38s]  century ago. The punishment for this insult remains the same.
[3051.38s -> 3074.36s]  You didn't save that guy. I missed the QTE. No, I didn't. Oh my God. It was like a fucking
[3074.36s -> 3094.39s]  death room. I was trying to jump through it. It's not the time to like show off.
[3095.59s -> 3100.60s]  Oh my God. All right. Stop it. Look at all these bones. How do you, I'm trying to slide.
[3101.32s -> 3131.62s]  Oh, it's just walk through it. Oh my dude. Hey, what that wouldn't be.
[3132.18s -> 3135.46s]  I'm made out of fucking solid steel. It would scrape my chest.
[3141.32s -> 3190.42s]  Shit. No, this is hard. This is actually fucking hard. Oh my goodness. Jesus. Okay.
[3194.74s -> 3205.29s]  I was just going to say what, what is this doing down here? Oh dude. What? Oh my God, man.
[3206.57s -> 3219.56s]  Get away from me. Holy shit. That was impossible. I accidentally just did that. Sticking that
[3219.56s -> 3223.96s]  landing makes the whole thing, you know, everything's good. Everyone's dead.
[3225.30s -> 3234.58s]  Game's loud. I turned it on. That should be better. It's like a thousand people down here.
[3241.29s -> 3247.14s]  That was insane. Hey, Jerma, are you there? Oh my God. I thought that was in the game.
[3248.41s -> 3255.26s]  I thought that was in the game. Oh my God. That scared the shit out of me. Jerma. It's me.
[3256.46s -> 3263.34s]  Snake. Solid snake. I have a question. What's up? I finished the first mission,
[3264.22s -> 3267.10s]  but it's still not unlocking multiplayer. How do I unlock multiplayer?
[3267.90s -> 3277.90s]  Hmm. So I, my multiplayer is unlocked. Let me see. I wonder if I can just pull you in
[3277.90s -> 3280.94s]  because did anybody know what, what mission you have to do? Cause I didn't pay attention
[3280.94s -> 3286.73s]  to that yesterday the day before. Which one did you pick by the way? Cause I'm,
[3286.73s -> 3292.54s]  I'm, I'm double gatted up. What, what are you playing as a red hood? Yeah, I got the gat.
[3293.10s -> 3299.62s]  Okay. That's fine. I'm playing as the much superior Robin. Uh, no shot. You picked Robin.
[3299.62s -> 3305.43s]  You need to do mission 1.2. Let me see if somebody got the answer here. Mission 1.2,
[3305.43s -> 3308.95s]  where you investigate Langstrom's corpse. That's the mission you have to complete.
[3308.95s -> 3314.89s]  I did that already. I just investigated that. Did you complete it? Or wait, no. Uh, I don't think
[3314.89s -> 3322.86s]  I did. Wait, maybe I didn't do it. Oh, people are saying, oh, you didn't do it. Okay. Um, okay. F1
[3322.86s -> 3326.70s]  Batman's last case, the Langstrom drive, right? The Belfry is being brought back online until
[3326.70s -> 3330.62s]  then patrol the streets of Gotham and fight criminals. That sounds like it is. It should
[3330.62s -> 3338.36s]  be 1.2. You have to, uh, did you do the part where you investigate the corpse? There's like a,
[3338.36s -> 3343.42s]  you look at the corpse and it's like a little detective mini game. I don't think I did that.
[3343.42s -> 3348.89s]  Yeah. Um, no, I have not seen a corpse yet. I'm just investigating criminals. I'm investigating
[3348.89s -> 3355.54s]  crimes right now or not crimes. I'm just waiting for crimes to happen so I can deliver some swift
[3355.54s -> 3361.14s]  vigilante justice in the form of red hood with my guns. Yeah. The game is that you have to,
[3361.14s -> 3365.06s]  you do crime, you solve crimes and stuff in the kind of in between
[3365.06s -> 3370.98s]  of the main mission. I don't do crime. I solve a long story. Can I be the one that says that's
[3370.98s -> 3375.38s]  kind of stuff? Cause I'm Robin. I'll tell you more when I get back. Wait, okay. Wait, what's,
[3375.38s -> 3380.18s]  what are the vibes? What would my vibes be as I'm solving the way, did you say you were solving
[3380.18s -> 3384.26s]  crimes? Or did you say, what did you say? Wait, hold on. I'm hearing machine gun fire.
[3385.75s -> 3391.27s]  Oh no, I don't do crime. No. Yeah. I'm supposed to be like the smart one that can
[3391.59s -> 3396.07s]  finagle engineering and stuff and get us out of sticky situations we might get ourselves into.
[3397.18s -> 3401.02s]  Oh my God. I'm so good at shooting. It's not even funny. Yeah. You just, you're the muscle.
[3401.74s -> 3414.30s]  As long as you're the muscle and on the brains, we'll be fine. As I almost get by a train.
[3415.10s -> 3420.17s]  What did you say, Jeremiah? I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry. Oh, I just said I'll be the brains.
[3420.17s -> 3426.18s]  You'd be the muscle. Okay, good. I have no brain. So that works perfectly for me. I think I just
[3426.18s -> 3436.07s]  stopped the crime. It should be the other way around. How? No, definitely not. Well,
[3436.07s -> 3442.84s]  actually I've seen old photos of you and you are a thought. So. Okay. I question for you.
[3443.74s -> 3448.94s]  What's up? If you were to pick a Batman rogues gallery villain that you would identify with it,
[3448.94s -> 3458.14s]  like, oh, that's me. Who would it be? I have no idea. I mean, I don't know. I don't have a good,
[3458.14s -> 3461.82s]  I don't have a good enough. Oh my God. This is wonderful. You think you're like the Joker or?
[3462.70s -> 3466.14s]  No, that's too cliche. I feel like everyone always picks that.
[3467.10s -> 3472.94s]  Okay. What about the Redler? I like Bane, not Riddler. I think Bane is more my speed. He was
[3472.94s -> 3477.98s]  a bit of a, he was a bit of a lefty too. Okay. All right. That's a good answer. He was just
[3477.98s -> 3482.54s]  not ideologically pure, but he was close to being a lefty. Like he had the motivation.
[3482.54s -> 3485.74s]  Let's see if master Bruce left us anymore. Okay. Like that's um,
[3487.42s -> 3490.38s]  Margie. I can respect that. Okay. What would you be the Riddler?
[3491.34s -> 3498.86s]  Um, I would be the person that is selling all the equipment. I would want to, I would want
[3498.86s -> 3506.46s]  to be the one that was like just part of the company, but nothing concrete. I can't authenticate
[3506.46s -> 3512.06s]  any of these. Someone said German would be the mad hatter. I'm in the same universe. I love the
[3514.06s -> 3519.02s]  sound. You are talking over my cut scene. What would have made a wonderful addition to the library?
[3519.02s -> 3528.30s]  Am I loud? I'm just, I'm trying to see what's happening. I am trying to literally unlock the
[3528.30s -> 3533.74s]  mission, but it's not unlocking it. I think I need to solve more crime. There were a lot of bodies.
[3533.74s -> 3539.82s]  Yeah. You should have a thing like a case file thing and it'll tell you like, oh, there's this
[3539.82s -> 3544.30s]  you can do. There's this you can do. Go solve some stuff in Gotham. Yeah. No, that's what I did,
[3544.30s -> 3548.62s]  but it was like, wait, hold on. Now it's loud. Okay. I did that, but then it was like,
[3550.36s -> 3553.72s]  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to lower the audio of the game first because
[3554.44s -> 3559.96s]  games these days are so loud. I feel like an old man saying that young whippersnapper.
[3560.60s -> 3564.04s]  All right. Out of the four here, who do you think is the coolest? Nightwing, Red Hood,
[3564.04s -> 3570.10s]  Robin or Batgirl? No, Red Hood. 100. Ah, Nightwing, Nightwing. Good answer. I wasn't
[3570.10s -> 3574.58s]  going to leave the call if you said, uh, Red Hood. Why? What's up with this anti-Red Hood
[3574.58s -> 3580.58s]  sentiment that I'm hearing from so many people? Nightwing is like my favorite.
[3583.61s -> 3593.06s]  I mean, Nightwing is pretty good. Nightwing is the original. I wonder if I can just like
[3593.06s -> 3606.89s]  suck you into my game. It might be possible. All right. Let me read my emails. Oh, right
[3606.89s -> 3613.69s]  direction. Belfry. Did you get it? No, I think this is the crime I need to solve though.
[3613.69s -> 3621.03s]  I'm sending you the coordinates now. Did I get any new stuff? Let me see. Nice.
[3624.87s -> 3633.53s]  Oh, I like that one. That looks cool. By the way, as you play, make sure you check on your gear too.
[3634.66s -> 3639.54s]  Uh, this, you got suits, you unlock suits, you unlock weapons. Oh yeah. I want to change out of
[3639.54s -> 3649.26s]  the sleeveless hoodie as quickly as possible. I have a point I can put in. Oh, I have to go to
[3649.26s -> 3658.55s]  the GCPD morgue now. There it is. That's the one I can't steal cars though, which is no,
[3658.55s -> 3666.44s]  you do have access to the bicycle though. I really do wonder what this game is going to be like in
[3666.44s -> 3672.12s]  co-op. Are we going to, you haven't done it yet. So you played the game already. You did one.
[3672.12s -> 3679.85s]  Yeah. I played the last couple of days. Okay. Okay. Because I think we can be anywhere. I,
[3679.85s -> 3683.37s]  um, this might be incorrect. I'm curious, but I don't think it's like, oh, you have to be within
[3683.37s -> 3693.59s]  like 10 feet of each other or something. I wonder maybe you do. Is there a camera? Can you turn on
[3693.59s -> 3700.63s]  camera tracking while you're, uh, while you're driving or is that just a product of me playing
[3700.63s -> 3703.59s]  keyboard? Are you playing keyboard and mouse or are you playing controller? Uh, I would say
[3703.59s -> 3710.26s]  keyboard and mouse would be an, a not ideal way to play this game. Are you on keyboard mouse?
[3711.85s -> 3717.70s]  I am. Were you playing multiverses on keyboard and mouse too? No, no, no, you weren't. I was
[3717.70s -> 3728.01s]  just bad at multiverses. I was just bad at it. Uh, where's my car? Wait, what? Everyone's asking
[3728.01s -> 3736.89s]  you to hit the Luddie. Have you hit the Luddie yet? I have not. Have you? Yeah. Oh yeah. I nailed
[3736.89s -> 3751.05s]  it. I'll hit it after this. Wait, what? Weird. What? So I'm, I'm going to, I'm not going to start
[3751.05s -> 3756.47s]  a new story mission. Wait, I'm just, I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Yeah. I'm just going to do
[3756.47s -> 3761.75s]  some, uh, let's do some crime investigation. I got here. I'm a GCPD. There you go. All right.
[3761.75s -> 3769.13s]  So you're probably like 10 minutes away. 15 minutes. Maybe I'll solve a couple of, uh,
[3769.13s -> 3776.47s]  city crimes while I wait for you. All right. Are there any, there's one here. What's this?
[3776.47s -> 3780.12s]  Good thing I don't need to walk in from the front door.
[3784.17s -> 3792.04s]  One of the, wonder why the cops would be on alert. Oh yeah. You, if you, if you cause like,
[3792.04s -> 3797.78s]  like chaos and mayhem, like they're like, they get annoyed with you, but they don't,
[3797.78s -> 3804.26s]  they don't like vigilante justice. No, you only, it's a, it's a dish best served cold.
[3804.98s -> 3811.67s]  Can you do it a little deeper? It's a dish best served cold. Can you go even just a little bit
[3811.67s -> 3817.59s]  more? It's a dish best served cold. Very good, but less cookie monster, more like scary.
[3818.55s -> 3825.67s]  It's a dish best served cold. That was close. That's as far as it goes, man.
[3836.38s -> 3842.92s]  Why am I walking? I have a car. Why am I walking to this? Oh, you upgraded from the, from the,
[3843.72s -> 3851.90s]  Oh, well, a bicycle from the bicycle. Okay. Oh wait, upstairs door. There you go. Oh,
[3851.90s -> 3858.54s]  no, it doesn't work. German. How do I get into the GCPD? Um, unfortunately that, that was three
[3858.54s -> 3864.15s]  days ago. So it's gone from my memory and nothing goes into long-term memory. I actually, I really
[3864.15s -> 3872.06s]  have no idea. I don't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday. You know what I mean?
[3872.46s -> 3882.25s]  It's that literal. All right, give me the car or the motorcycle. Oh no, I went the wrong way.
[3885.06s -> 3893.18s]  I think he's just literally saying, go through the front door. You know who I am?
[3898.20s -> 3911.13s]  One of my chats said, ask him for money. He won't remember. They really got it out for you.
[3911.13s -> 3918.17s]  I would remember that. You say you don't remember what you have for breakfast. I like that he said,
[3918.17s -> 3922.70s]  what am I going to do? Go through the front door. And I went into the back door. I would definitely
[3922.70s -> 3928.30s]  put a sticky note on like, oh, hey, like Hassan owes me 50 grand or whatever. Right?
[3928.94s -> 3942.04s]  I wouldn't sticky note what I had for breakfast yesterday. Oh, German. I'm, I'm beating cops
[3942.76s -> 3945.69s]  pretty aggressively and violently. I don't know what's going on.
[3946.49s -> 3953.75s]  Oh, the game, the game gets a little nuts. I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing that,
[3953.75s -> 3960.65s]  but I'm kind of cops. I want to do the, uh, I want to do the like prison mission with you with like
[3960.65s -> 3968.65s]  the, you guys chat, you guys know with the song. I w I kind of want to be pulled into your game.
[3976.86s -> 3980.14s]  It's pretty clear how to go to places and yet I'm still failing.
[3981.98s -> 3990.34s]  I already failed the mission. No, no, no, no, not at all. I just went the wrong way.
[3993.48s -> 3997.64s]  I just went the wrong way. It's okay. That's not a bad, that's not a bad guy.
[3997.64s -> 4004.42s]  Okay. I was checking tactically, giving an ocular pat down to the other side of the car.
[4008.26s -> 4054.86s]  Oh, wait, the bomb's going to detonate in a minute. What? Oh, oh, this is bad. I'm sorry.
[4054.86s -> 4059.26s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[4060.14s -> 4071.66s]  A citizen's injured here. Medics are inbound to your location. Oh no. That was bad.
[4072.46s -> 4079.26s]  I really could have used some, uh, muscle there. I know. Well, luckily you and everyone else who
[4079.26s -> 4085.74s]  gets this game by clicking on either of our panels could potentially play cooperative and get all the
[4085.74s -> 4092.92s]  help that they need. Pretty good. Pretty good. Right? Dude, I'm, I'm pretty cracked with it.
[4092.92s -> 4099.70s]  Did you, uh, I saw if you happen to tell anybody what platforms this could be on,
[4099.70s -> 4107.82s]  couldn't be on, you know, uh, I did not. They're on, uh, PlayStation five, Xbox series S X and
[4108.78s -> 4119.38s]  the PC. Got it. This has been an injury. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, there's another one over
[4119.38s -> 4129.30s]  here. So they didn't stop doing that. Oh, wait, I am in prison. Did you say prison break or no,
[4129.30s -> 4135.40s]  it's the bullpen. Uh, there's a mission after and like another 30, 40 minutes from where you are.
[4135.40s -> 4146.30s]  That's just, um, it's a little, it's a little wild. Okay. Let me try to do this again and not
[4146.30s -> 4158.17s]  mess this whole thing up. This seems kind of hard. No, you don't. Cause you're the downed officer.
[4160.62s -> 4161.42s]  I'll meet myself.
[4164.06s -> 4170.26s]  Is he seeing me? I don't think, I think he thinks of a statue.
[4170.90s -> 4193.83s]  That's awesome. Why does he got Fortnite dancing? That's a literal Fortnite dance.
[4193.83s -> 4201.03s]  He's hanging with a pretty rough. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
[4206.90s -> 4214.70s]  All right. This mission is kind of hard. Oh shit.
[4216.22s -> 4220.34s]  Are the freaks gentrifying?
[4225.14s -> 4268.74s]  Robin trouble. I'm not failing this the second time.
[4269.46s -> 4280.10s]  Thank you. There we go.
[4288.20s -> 4291.96s]  Have you heard any reports of the freaks actively recruiting suburban types like
[4291.96s -> 4294.36s]  soccer moms or guys really into their public bites?
[4297.80s -> 4300.20s]  I wish. So wait, why are they?
[4303.64s -> 4307.37s]  So some of these people are, they're not, I don't know.
[4313.21s -> 4318.74s]  All right, cool. So that I prevented a crime there. Good. Oh shit. I am not muted. I'm just
[4318.74s -> 4323.38s]  talking through Hassan's stream right now. I think. Oh my God. I'm sorry. Let me fix that.
[4325.82s -> 4347.06s]  I'm just like streaming at Hassan's stream. Get me out of here. So something going on right here.
[4347.06s -> 4356.20s]  It's okay. Jeremiah, you're making the stream, but the wrong call,
[4356.84s -> 4371.58s]  you're the wrong discord bit. I'm not going to do the wrong discord routine.
[4373.03s -> 4375.91s]  It's not possible. And this is more than two or three people in a call together.
[4380.30s -> 4388.36s]  It just being me and Hassan on a call, my indicator is just going to light up.
[4389.80s -> 4400.62s]  Oh shit. What's going on? What are they chasing? What are they doing? Where are they going? I'm
[4400.62s -> 4431.77s]  very, I need to see, I need to investigate this. Okay. Ooh, new move. Oh, that was good.
[4434.04s -> 4437.08s]  I feel like a bowstaff would be fun to just like, that would be a good weapon. Right.
[4448.63s -> 4459.43s]  So what's going on here? What's the actual crime? What? Somebody's trimming hedges
[4460.47s -> 4476.07s]  where they shouldn't be. What is that song? Okay. So I, did I do it?
[4485.51s -> 4489.32s]  I think it was those two people that I was chasing. I think that's what it was.
[4491.56s -> 4514.28s]  Well, I'll take whatever that is. How do I get that? There it is. Cool. All right. There's a,
[4514.28s -> 4519.80s]  there's an Omega crime going on over here. I'll try to do the, the red Omega crime.
[4520.60s -> 4527.94s]  It's actually going to, you know, it's going to be probably kind of funny watching the song,
[4527.94s -> 4532.10s]  like try to do this because he's, he's just trying to get to the co-op part, right?
[4533.06s -> 4553.74s]  Doesn't have the kind of experience that we have here. So what is the issue? What's happening?
[4553.74s -> 4567.62s]  What does it say on the map? You see PD report. Uh, okay. So we'll have to go report to
[4569.30s -> 4593.10s]  stolen goods being moved. Robin is silent. All right. So I got to scan the, what is all that?
[4593.66s -> 4602.54s]  Okay. Camera control panel. All right. Disable those cameras. This is a Batgirl mission.
[4609.96s -> 4642.07s]  Oh, come on. He's bugging out. Oh, wait. Where's it? Where's the organ? Where's the organ?
[4665.50s -> 4694.04s]  Yes. Get out of the way. All right. What do I deliver this to? Right there. All right. Turn
[4694.04s -> 4704.46s]  around. Where's the song? Uh, he's currently, uh, getting to the point where he can play the
[4704.46s -> 4726.73s]  multiplayer. What are you doing over here? Wait, what? This is bad. I got to turn it in to here.
[4726.73s -> 4744.39s]  I have 17 seconds. Make it count. Robin, don't do a flourish. Oh my God.
[4758.02s -> 4764.76s]  Had to do the flourish. You got an expiring organ in your pocket and you got to do the,
[4764.76s -> 4783.99s]  the spin jump swing. Oh, I may have gotten stuck under the, the, uh, sign. How did I do this to
[4783.99s -> 4808.26s]  myself? I must've gotten into the perfect. Okay. I can just fast travel. Well, I hook what I'm
[4808.26s -> 4825.72s]  playing is Robin. Yeah. Gotham Knights. There was more to that sense. Oh, we have a cut scene.
[4825.72s -> 4834.79s]  This is a Robin cut scene. Let's check it out. I was surprised. There's no way the penguin does
[4834.79s -> 4842.52s]  not double cross. Like, I mean, zero percent chance. All right. Let's see what this, uh,
[4842.52s -> 4861.08s]  cut scene is. Playing with a ghost, Alfred. You might say that I'm finishing my last game with
[4861.08s -> 4869.34s]  Bruce. This is kind of sad. I couldn't save our board from the manor, but I do have our notes.
[4871.54s -> 4878.52s]  We tracked each move. All right. I think I'm in, I'm in, uh, Belfry tutorial ending patrol.
[4879.40s -> 4887.00s]  I think night one crime stop zero citizens rescue too. I feel like that's more important. You know
[4887.00s -> 4891.40s]  what I mean? What good is stopping crime if you're not saving citizens? Oh, there's another mini,
[4892.28s -> 4912.41s]  another cut scene. Yeah. Uh, watch that cut scene and we'll, we'll, okay. Are you winning playing
[4912.41s -> 4923.72s]  as Bruce? I can't see how he loses. Bruce is dead. Maybe he wins your game, but without him,
[4924.36s -> 4938.50s]  I'm not so sure about that. Not so sure he's dead. Not so sure we've lost. Bruce played an important
[4938.50s -> 4952.95s]  role, but he never saw himself as the only piece in play. I mean, take a little bit of credit,
[4952.95s -> 4963.74s]  Robin. Like you, you are, you are just as good. You are a good superhero and you got your own
[4963.74s -> 4967.42s]  shit going on. And let's, you know, let's watch another cut scene because this is another one
[4967.42s -> 5022.82s]  here. This is bike one. That green slime hurt Jason. When I fell from heaven, when you came
[5022.82s -> 5032.25s]  back to life, he just screwed that in with his bare hands. He didn't even need a wrench. It changed
[5032.25s -> 5044.84s]  me. Hey, Lazarus isn't going to bring Bruce back to who's to say he doesn't want us to try.
[5047.48s -> 5065.45s]  Oh, he wants to break. Okay. I see what's happening here. Okay. Bruce isn't this bike. You
[5065.45s -> 5069.21s]  can't just change everything out and expect things to work like they did.
[5070.17s -> 5115.90s]  Then what am I supposed to do? Try grieving. What? He's locked. I want that one. I want this one.
[5115.90s -> 5127.59s]  I want this one bad. I want this one. I want this one bad. I want this one real bad. I want this one.
[5127.59s -> 5150.71s]  How do I buy these? I want this one. Oh my God. I want this one so bad. They're all locked. All
[5150.71s -> 5162.18s]  right. Do I? What's next? What's the main story mission that I have? I have this. The Penguin.
[5162.18s -> 5171.05s]  Penguin is available. This Court of Owls thing is available. Dr. Jada Tompkins is available.
[5171.61s -> 5182.78s]  I wonder how close the sound is. I want to start something major. Hey, what's your,
[5182.78s -> 5188.49s]  what do you got for an ETA? You think you're pretty close? Yeah. I'm talking, I'm having a
[5188.49s -> 5193.53s]  moment with Alfred right now. Okay. I'll shut up. He's crying about Bruce dying. Did you know Bruce
[5193.53s -> 5201.77s]  Wayne is Batman? I mean, I heard that. Did I spoil? Did I spoil everything? I'm sorry.
[5201.77s -> 5207.64s]  I don't know. Do you mean like the billionaire of Bruce Wayne? What? Yeah. Billionaire Bruce
[5207.64s -> 5217.43s]  Wayne is Batman. Oh, okay. Oh no. Chat's saying major spoilers, dude. Damn it. I thought,
[5223.38s -> 5229.98s]  it's time to craft. Okay. I need to complete, prepare for patrol and complete interrogation
[5229.98s -> 5239.11s]  training. And I think after that, I suspect I will be able to, I guess like I have to complete
[5239.11s -> 5244.58s]  interrogation training. And then after that, maybe. I think that's it. I think that's the one.
[5245.14s -> 5257.94s]  Dude, I'm making a legendary slingshot. I'm trying to upgrade my guns, man. Yeah. You get a crap.
[5257.94s -> 5260.66s]  You can go to the workbench when you have a chance. You might have something you can make.
[5261.78s -> 5265.22s]  Yeah. It's just gun level one though. Oh, you can switch right here.
[5266.10s -> 5279.10s]  I think it's time to switch to Nightwing. Pick somebody else. Pick a different character.
[5280.62s -> 5285.90s]  Okay. Yeah. Nightwing's like dumb. That's not even like a fun. It's like, I play as Nightwing
[5285.90s -> 5291.16s]  sometimes, but like, usually I'm the Nightwing guy. I'm like the Nightwing streamer. Oh, you're
[5291.16s -> 5295.72s]  the Nightwing guy. Okay. I'll just keep, I'll stay with Red Hood. It's fine. No, you don't,
[5295.72s -> 5299.48s]  you don't have to. No, no, no. It's cool, man. No, you don't do, you don't have to. It's my
[5299.48s -> 5306.52s]  first time playing the game. I guess. No, I don't know. Okay. No. Yeah. All right. Yeah. If you
[5306.52s -> 5311.80s]  insist, I'll just stay with the Jarhead haircut. It's fine. Okay. This is advanced training,
[5311.80s -> 5315.08s]  ability training and basic training. It says learn interrogation training, but I don't know where
[5315.08s -> 5320.62s]  that would be. Is that in advanced? Okay. And I had, okay, let me show you. So if you go over
[5320.62s -> 5326.70s]  to the training dummy, go to the training dummy. I found it. There it is. It takes about two minutes
[5326.70s -> 5332.66s]  and be ready because it's cool. Here it comes. You're going to go. Holy shit. Physical and mental
[5332.66s -> 5338.02s]  preservation go hand in hand. Oh, Batman's alive. As a young child, I didn't want to say it. They
[5338.02s -> 5346.38s]  were behind his parents. Okay. It must not be Bruce Wayne then because Bruce Wayne is dead.
[5346.38s -> 5365.00s]  Spoilers. I think this on is very close. I think I have enough time to do one more small crime.
[5365.88s -> 5377.62s]  I mean, prevent one more small crime. It's better. Wait, that's it. I just said,
[5377.62s -> 5381.94s]  tell me what I want to know. And he said, cat don't got this tongue. I'll tell you what you
[5381.94s -> 5385.22s]  want to know. Then we'll be free to fly to and from this neighborhood as much as we want.
[5386.34s -> 5390.92s]  That's a surveillance drone. Scan each one in the sector and send me the data.
[5392.20s -> 5395.00s]  Then we'll be free to fly to and from this neighborhood as much as we want.
[5395.96s -> 5406.49s]  Once I reprogram them to look the other way. Yes. In the drone. Where's this drone that he's
[5406.49s -> 5421.88s]  talking about? Oh my God. Batman said I've come so far. Okay. So when I exit, oh no,
[5421.88s -> 5428.55s]  now I can play multiplayer. Let's go. Hold on. Let's switch over to multiplayer. Oh,
[5428.55s -> 5436.15s]  is this quick math? Main story, heroic assault, main story, right? I would assume. Yeah.
[5436.79s -> 5443.19s]  I think that's a waiting to join. Are you just joining me? I don't know. Are you? Did you host
[5443.19s -> 5452.36s]  me? No. It said joining host. Did you just join a random game? I don't know. Who, man? Wait, what?
[5453.40s -> 5459.67s]  I've joined a random person. Random person's game. I don't know how that happened. Oh,
[5459.67s -> 5465.88s]  because I think you did quick play. Did I? I think. Hold on. Let me, let me investigate this.
[5466.52s -> 5476.06s]  Let me do some investigation here. Oh, I should go to social, game invites, friends. There it is.
[5477.26s -> 5487.18s]  Theme friends. There it is. And then you. Yes, can. Wait, did I actually accept your friend
[5487.18s -> 5495.16s]  request? I thought I did. Did you not? Awkward. But you didn't accept my friend request. I just,
[5495.16s -> 5501.59s]  I just accepted it. Yeah, because you were forced to on stream. Oh, that's awkward, man. That's
[5501.67s -> 5509.29s]  kind of whatever. I guess I'll just join you right now. I might as well. Sorry about that.
[5512.78s -> 5523.75s]  Oh, there you are. Oh, hold on. Hold up. Did it not work? Oh, I'm here. There you are.
[5523.75s -> 5530.82s]  Gas can has joined the chat. OK, I got to come find you. Yeah, you are really far away.
[5531.70s -> 5536.34s]  Wait, really? We can look, look at, look at how far away we can be. I don't think it's going to
[5536.34s -> 5547.32s]  ever. No, I'm Robin. Oh, OK, that is way drippier. You look like Legend of Zelda, Robin. I look cool.
[5548.36s -> 5553.26s]  You hold on. The other Robin looked so, you know, about the other character in the game.
[5553.26s -> 5555.74s]  This is like there's a bunch of characters here. I'll show you one.
[5556.54s -> 5563.70s]  Um, is, uh, what's his name? Watch out. Who's that? What's his name? Um,
[5564.10s -> 5570.49s]  bald boy. Right. I forgot. Wait, what? What is this? It's bald boy. It's another Batman.
[5572.30s -> 5576.86s]  How did you change your character so swiftly? You would, you know, you don't know bald boy is.
[5578.66s -> 5585.72s]  No, you wait. You, you know who Batman is, but you don't know who bald boy is.
[5586.76s -> 5590.52s]  Oh, who's bald? That's all right. You're trolling. Does the train ever come?
[5590.52s -> 5593.56s]  Like, I feel like we'd get cooked if a train just decided to.
[5594.52s -> 5599.94s]  Wait, where are you going? All right. We don't. Whose mission are we on? Are we on mine or yours?
[5600.74s -> 5604.50s]  No, it would be yours, I think. All right. So let's go. Let's let me mark something.
[5606.18s -> 5614.55s]  Let's do. Wait, I can change my suits, uh, dial in in many. No, I can't. I think I'm about to spoil
[5614.55s -> 5619.59s]  like the first third of the game for you, by the way. It's OK. Because we're about to go talk to
[5619.59s -> 5625.21s]  a certain character. I'm down to do the mission with you. All right, let's go. Let's do we both
[5625.29s -> 5632.09s]  have like, it seems like you need the help. Oh, or wait, do I get on your back? I don't know.
[5632.09s -> 5637.94s]  Let's find out. It won't let me. Do you have to have your own? Oh, you have your own bike.
[5637.94s -> 5641.62s]  I wish I could just like, yeah, I wish I could mount your bike with you.
[5643.06s -> 5649.91s]  All right, let's go. You got to ride a wheelie the whole time. That's part of it.
[5650.63s -> 5664.42s]  OK, we're like the. Whoa. This is the reason why Eric Adams said no more motorbikes in New York
[5664.42s -> 5667.78s]  City, by the way, because of this kind of behavior that we're engaging in.
[5668.50s -> 5674.41s]  You're doing pretty good. The little political joke, a little political.
[5674.41s -> 5679.94s]  Was that a political joke? Yeah. One of the.
[5682.66s -> 5686.66s]  I don't know where you're going. Oh, excuse me.
[5688.42s -> 5692.57s]  You just used me as a jump. That was pretty cool. I did that on purpose.
[5692.57s -> 5694.41s]  Actually, that was sick. All right. Let's get on.
[5695.21s -> 5700.97s]  You might have thought that I was actually scared, but really, I was just doing it as a joke.
[5702.33s -> 5707.29s]  I love how you're in character. Oh, yeah. Wait, hold on, hold on.
[5708.25s -> 5710.97s]  I think I'm going to turn you up. Let me I'm going to go to gear.
[5710.97s -> 5713.37s]  I'm going to go to gear. Oh, my God, I can change my suit.
[5715.94s -> 5718.02s]  You got a better suit. Beyond.
[5719.43s -> 5722.23s]  We both look like henchmen of.
[5723.19s -> 5726.18s]  What is the red hood beyond suit look like?
[5731.96s -> 5734.28s]  Pretty cool. I think I've seen it.
[5735.00s -> 5738.74s]  All right, so we're going to go over here, so hop off the bikes.
[5738.74s -> 5745.27s]  We're going up there and we're going to visit a particular character.
[5752.94s -> 5755.66s]  I don't know what I did. Where are you?
[5755.66s -> 5760.15s]  We got to go in the ceiling. Oh, God.
[5768.94s -> 5771.90s]  What? I can't get to you. I don't know why.
[5771.90s -> 5773.02s]  No, you're right here. You're right here.
[5773.82s -> 5776.46s]  I know, but won't let me jump up there for some reason.
[5778.55s -> 5781.35s]  So yeah, jump right down here. There you are.
[5783.11s -> 5785.75s]  All right. Just duck and roll, baby.
[5786.87s -> 5788.71s]  Oh, he's just right here. Get him.
[5788.71s -> 5791.03s]  Oh, what? Dude, spoilers.
[5791.03s -> 5793.35s]  Watch out. He's got grenades and shit. Watch out.
[5794.15s -> 5795.83s]  Wait, really? No.
[5799.51s -> 5800.47s]  Are you seeing this cut scene?
[5802.22s -> 5803.90s]  No, I'm just hearing him talk to you.
[5805.66s -> 5807.10s]  Can you walk behind me? Like, get behind me.
[5807.74s -> 5810.92s]  What do you want? Straight to the point.
[5811.64s -> 5813.00s]  Like, will you just appear in the cut scene?
[5813.88s -> 5816.20s]  So how's about a little part? I'm behind you.
[5817.30s -> 5818.98s]  I'm too young to run about. No, you're not there.
[5818.98s -> 5820.98s]  And I don't have a fake ID either.
[5820.98s -> 5826.90s]  You misunderstand me, friend. As the owner of a respected establishment,
[5826.90s -> 5829.22s]  I have an interest in keeping the streets safe.
[5830.50s -> 5833.37s]  You could help. What's your angle?
[5834.09s -> 5836.01s]  Are you hoping I'll take out some of your competitors?
[5836.01s -> 5838.25s]  Speaking of angles, you should probably angle the umbrella up.
[5838.49s -> 5840.97s]  I'm not in the crime business anymore. So you don't get rained on.
[5840.97s -> 5846.81s]  So if I can't cross any unusual gear, I'd be obliged to turn it over.
[5846.81s -> 5848.49s]  Upstanding citizen that I am.
[5849.85s -> 5853.77s]  You're lucky they're criminals, or I wouldn't even consider it.
[5854.79s -> 5857.91s]  Well, that's the spirit. You're working with crimers?
[5858.95s -> 5862.87s]  Sometimes you have to work with information.
[5862.87s -> 5864.79s]  That's my response to you. You see that?
[5864.79s -> 5869.40s]  What about my response? Wait, do you see my emotes?
[5870.52s -> 5874.79s]  Wait, I don't... What are you, rock, paper, scissoring?
[5874.79s -> 5875.43s]  I don't get it.
[5875.43s -> 5876.71s]  Yeah. All right. Let's rock, paper, scissors.
[5877.35s -> 5879.32s]  So if you select the emotes and then do...
[5879.32s -> 5880.44s]  Good job. Good job.
[5881.16s -> 5882.28s]  Wait, I can't do another emote?
[5884.76s -> 5886.44s]  I don't think I have rock, paper, scissors.
[5888.50s -> 5891.22s]  No. All right. So now we have to go from here.
[5893.06s -> 5896.07s]  And... Okay.
[5897.50s -> 5900.62s]  They're kind of rude of Mr. Penguin not to even acknowledge my existence,
[5900.62s -> 5901.66s]  but that's okay, I guess.
[5902.62s -> 5904.54s]  Oh, his name is Mr. Penguin.
[5905.93s -> 5908.17s]  That actually makes him way less intimidating to me.
[5909.93s -> 5913.61s]  Oh, Mr. Penguin. Mr. Penguin to me is like an actual penguin
[5913.61s -> 5916.57s]  that's like the animal with the stripe on his stomach and stuff.
[5916.57s -> 5919.77s]  Mr. Penguin. That's not the penguin. Penguin is scary.
[5921.48s -> 5923.48s]  Wait, this guy's not the penguin?
[5923.48s -> 5925.80s]  No, he is. But like, you called him Mr. Penguin.
[5926.86s -> 5929.42s]  Yeah. Mr. Penguin was my father's name.
[5930.94s -> 5932.94s]  I'm just the regular old penguin.
[5932.94s -> 5934.06s]  All right. Where are we going?
[5934.06s -> 5936.06s]  We're going to go this way. We're going to do the owl stuff.
[5936.78s -> 5940.30s]  I'm not going to lie. This is giving Spider-Man a little bit.
[5941.74s -> 5944.78s]  With our suits. I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.
[5944.78s -> 5946.46s]  That's a different franchise entirely.
[5946.46s -> 5949.74s]  This is Gotham Knights. This is the DC Universe's Gotham Knights
[5950.30s -> 5955.66s]  starring Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and of course, who could forget Red Hood?
[5956.62s -> 5957.98s]  All right. We should get on a bike.
[5958.78s -> 5960.94s]  All right. Get on a bike.
[5961.82s -> 5963.42s]  So we're going to go through here.
[5966.58s -> 5968.10s]  I'm curious how the gameplay is.
[5968.90s -> 5975.13s]  So what difficulty are you playing?
[5975.77s -> 5979.37s]  I was on hard, but I was kind of getting my ass kicked, so I put it to normal.
[5980.18s -> 5981.54s]  Oh, yeah. I'm on medium.
[5981.54s -> 5983.06s]  The big enemies are horrible.
[5983.78s -> 5990.47s]  If you play the game on hard, the huge enemies, they're just so tanky.
[5991.35s -> 5992.39s]  They're really difficult to kill.
[5993.19s -> 5995.34s]  All right. We're going right in this building up here.
[5998.63s -> 6001.46s]  So we're going to find a secret door.
[6001.46s -> 6002.18s]  Do you have this on the map?
[6003.38s -> 6005.85s]  I think I found the secret door.
[6009.29s -> 6010.09s]  Hammer right here.
[6011.69s -> 6013.45s]  Oh my God. I think you actually found it.
[6014.17s -> 6017.22s]  We can just take out the cameras.
[6018.33s -> 6019.13s]  How do you take them out?
[6019.85s -> 6024.25s]  If you hold left trigger, you can aim and then you can use right trigger to shoot.
[6028.66s -> 6029.22s]  Good to know.
[6030.02s -> 6030.98s]  All right. I'm turning this off.
[6033.05s -> 6035.53s]  Wait, crime resolved, secret identity compromised?
[6036.97s -> 6037.61s]  What?
[6037.61s -> 6038.89s]  That might have been a side mission.
[6040.02s -> 6042.26s]  Thanks for helping me complete my side mission, Hasan.
[6042.90s -> 6043.78s]  That's crazy.
[6043.78s -> 6045.46s]  I just compromised someone's secret identity.
[6045.46s -> 6046.26s]  He's kind of messed up.
[6047.61s -> 6048.33s]  He just doxxed.
[6049.93s -> 6051.77s]  I think we have to go down the front door.
[6052.97s -> 6054.09s]  Wait, no way.
[6054.09s -> 6054.41s]  Hey.
[6054.41s -> 6055.45s]  Oh, no, I'm falling.
[6056.17s -> 6056.81s]  Look what I found.
[6057.53s -> 6059.75s]  This looks pretty secret, doesn't it?
[6059.75s -> 6061.11s]  This is a secret door, I think.
[6061.11s -> 6061.67s]  Open this.
[6062.31s -> 6065.10s]  I suggest it to you, the host.
[6065.74s -> 6067.43s]  I mean, I am Robin.
[6067.43s -> 6068.39s]  I'm an engineer.
[6073.80s -> 6075.16s]  Wait, who did you say that to?
[6075.16s -> 6077.32s]  Why are you speaking to yourself in the third person?
[6077.32s -> 6078.12s]  Whoa, chill.
[6078.12s -> 6078.84s]  PvP, let's go.
[6079.88s -> 6081.11s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[6083.30s -> 6084.98s]  Fucking double agent for the owls.
[6084.98s -> 6087.78s]  I mean, I'm shooting the heck out of you right now.
[6087.78s -> 6090.66s]  So all right, let's go.
[6094.66s -> 6096.34s]  You have other suits in the styles tab.
[6096.34s -> 6097.22s]  Wait, hold on.
[6097.22s -> 6098.66s]  But let me look at it real quick.
[6099.38s -> 6102.90s]  Oh, there's different colorways.
[6102.90s -> 6104.58s]  Stop playing with me.
[6108.36s -> 6109.40s]  You have points to put in, too.
[6109.40s -> 6110.36s]  If you look through the skill tree.
[6113.80s -> 6114.44s]  Nice.
[6114.44s -> 6116.12s]  Oh, the shinobi one.
[6116.12s -> 6118.12s]  But transmog suit is locked.
[6119.35s -> 6120.79s]  Strange location for it.
[6120.79s -> 6126.01s]  I'll see what I can find.
[6126.01s -> 6128.57s]  Okay, these suits are sick, but it won't let me.
[6130.70s -> 6133.98s]  I can only get I can only apply a transmog
[6133.98s -> 6135.02s]  to the new guard.
[6135.02s -> 6137.66s]  I don't know what that means, but I can't get
[6140.17s -> 6142.09s]  I can't get night ops or shinobi.
[6143.90s -> 6145.42s]  I think I need to craft different gear.
[6146.22s -> 6152.71s]  This one's fine.
[6152.71s -> 6153.27s]  All right, you're good.
[6154.71s -> 6155.11s]  All right.
[6157.38s -> 6158.42s]  I'm good, gas can.
[6159.14s -> 6161.80s]  I think we have to solve there's probably a puzzle in here.
[6162.78s -> 6165.50s]  Oh, this isn't this isn't the mission.
[6165.50s -> 6166.00s]  Yeah.
[6167.16s -> 6168.12s]  Oh, it is the mission.
[6168.12s -> 6169.32s]  Okay, letter box.
[6169.96s -> 6172.12s]  We should probably look for to scan some documents here.
[6173.34s -> 6173.90s]  Moreno.
[6174.78s -> 6176.46s]  I feel like I know that name.
[6176.46s -> 6177.10s]  Me too.
[6177.10s -> 6180.14s]  Belfry, we have an open case file on the Moreno murder.
[6180.14s -> 6180.86s]  Can you look it up?
[6181.90s -> 6182.94s]  Case files.
[6182.94s -> 6186.38s]  The brother of Elena Moreno, a local judge.
[6186.38s -> 6188.54s]  She took a leave of absence from the bench
[6188.54s -> 6191.42s]  directly afterward for family reasons.
[6191.42s -> 6193.74s]  That's what would happen if you gave a camera to a monkey.
[6196.20s -> 6198.52s]  I actually think a monkey would probably turn the camera
[6198.52s -> 6200.28s]  and just be like taking pictures in its face.
[6201.67s -> 6203.19s]  I'm investigating this.
[6203.19s -> 6203.91s]  The West End.
[6203.91s -> 6206.31s]  This peg points east towards the hospital.
[6206.87s -> 6207.43s]  Okay.
[6207.43s -> 6208.95s]  This peg points northeast.
[6210.78s -> 6211.18s]  Interesting.
[6211.18s -> 6213.34s]  There's a card.
[6213.34s -> 6215.18s]  This takes me to be in old English.
[6215.18s -> 6219.34s]  AR scan analysis indicates means purge.
[6219.90s -> 6223.10s]  The rest of the text says kill all those who trespass.
[6223.10s -> 6226.95s]  This image matches the one on the second order.
[6226.95s -> 6227.19s]  All right.
[6227.19s -> 6229.11s]  So what means threatened?
[6229.11s -> 6231.59s]  The rest of the text says, make them fear us.
[6231.59s -> 6232.71s]  Well, we need to figure out.
[6232.79s -> 6236.01s]  So we need to figure out where the target is
[6236.01s -> 6237.53s]  and what the instructions are.
[6237.53s -> 6239.29s]  And you have to piece two pieces of evidence together.
[6239.29s -> 6241.75s]  Do you think we can handle that?
[6241.75s -> 6242.25s]  Okay.
[6243.43s -> 6246.71s]  There's another one that says kill the target.
[6246.71s -> 6248.79s]  And then there's one that says near way,
[6248.79s -> 6250.23s]  which means constrained or confined.
[6250.23s -> 6252.39s]  The rest of the text says, take them prisoner.
[6252.39s -> 6252.63s]  Okay.
[6252.63s -> 6255.29s]  So we're going to try kill the target.
[6255.29s -> 6258.20s]  And what do we know so far?
[6258.20s -> 6260.20s]  I have no idea what this mission is.
[6260.20s -> 6261.08s]  I'm supposed to be the brains.
[6261.08s -> 6261.96s]  I'm supposed to be the brains.
[6261.96s -> 6262.52s]  That's my bad.
[6262.52s -> 6263.40s]  You're supposed to be the brains.
[6263.40s -> 6264.12s]  What's going on?
[6264.12s -> 6265.32s]  There's an owl dagger here.
[6265.32s -> 6267.38s]  Maybe we use that to kill the target.
[6267.38s -> 6270.44s]  I think they're going to use the order to kill.
[6273.21s -> 6275.56s]  They want to kill somebody at Gotham River.
[6275.56s -> 6276.84s]  I messed up.
[6276.84s -> 6277.64s]  I spilled coffee.
[6277.64s -> 6278.84s]  I love my controller for a second.
[6279.72s -> 6281.21s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[6281.21s -> 6284.82s]  The order is to kill.
[6284.82s -> 6287.67s]  Let's see.
[6287.67s -> 6289.75s]  Symbols are different from the previous document,
[6289.75s -> 6292.15s]  but it seemed to indicate a command and a location.
[6292.15s -> 6293.02s]  Okay.
[6293.02s -> 6295.70s]  It looks like there is a kill there.
[6295.70s -> 6298.26s]  And it looks like that location is possibly.
[6299.32s -> 6300.84s]  I would have deduced this.
[6300.92s -> 6305.70s]  The order is to purge because the swords line up there.
[6305.70s -> 6308.66s]  Purge the river.
[6308.66s -> 6309.78s]  Thank you very much.
[6309.78s -> 6317.21s]  Brains of the operation.
[6317.21s -> 6317.53s]  Okay.
[6317.53s -> 6318.49s]  What happened?
[6318.49s -> 6321.85s]  Looks like the court gave a purge order to the Chelsea tunnel.
[6322.65s -> 6324.89s]  So by the way, I'm not going to fight any enemies.
[6324.89s -> 6325.69s]  That's for you to do.
[6325.69s -> 6327.37s]  Was declared unsafe.
[6327.93s -> 6329.98s]  That seems convenient.
[6329.98s -> 6332.82s]  The court of owls must have something hidden down there.
[6333.86s -> 6334.74s]  Heading that way now.
[6336.02s -> 6336.42s]  It's so funny.
[6336.42s -> 6339.16s]  You could have just like walked.
[6339.16s -> 6341.40s]  No, I rule in style.
[6342.04s -> 6344.65s]  What's your favorite Batman?
[6345.53s -> 6347.75s]  Dude, I don't know.
[6350.78s -> 6352.86s]  I mean, obviously the dark knight is, you know,
[6352.86s -> 6353.90s]  that's got to be up there, right?
[6355.37s -> 6357.29s]  I know that I didn't like the last one.
[6358.65s -> 6359.93s]  I didn't even see the last one.
[6360.82s -> 6361.70s]  That's crazy.
[6361.70s -> 6363.14s]  I really probably wanted to.
[6363.14s -> 6364.18s]  It's very angsty.
[6365.56s -> 6367.08s]  I think the original Batman cartoon.
[6367.88s -> 6369.48s]  Bro, you are cooking right now.
[6369.48s -> 6372.44s]  I don't know how I'm not able to go as fast as you.
[6372.44s -> 6372.92s]  Oh, all right.
[6372.92s -> 6375.48s]  So right before you land, it's going to say,
[6375.48s -> 6376.44s]  oh, jump.
[6376.44s -> 6377.64s]  You essentially want to time it.
[6377.64s -> 6380.04s]  So maybe like a half second before you land.
[6380.04s -> 6380.92s]  No, I got it.
[6380.92s -> 6381.16s]  Yeah.
[6381.88s -> 6383.66s]  All right.
[6383.66s -> 6384.54s]  So what is down here?
[6385.50s -> 6386.22s]  We got something here.
[6387.10s -> 6390.81s]  Lower level, maybe.
[6391.37s -> 6396.18s]  What are we looking for?
[6396.74s -> 6402.52s]  The court went to great lengths to halt construction at the Chelsea tunnel.
[6402.52s -> 6404.60s]  Investigate the construction site to uncover what they...
[6404.60s -> 6405.48s]  This is like level.
[6406.20s -> 6408.44s]  We're kind of under level for this, but whatever we can do it.
[6409.08s -> 6411.80s]  Dude, you got me on your side.
[6411.80s -> 6412.84s]  I'm the greatest carry.
[6413.40s -> 6414.60s]  Don't worry about a thing.
[6416.15s -> 6417.27s]  We have to find the entrance in here.
[6420.63s -> 6421.19s]  Maybe lower.
[6423.67s -> 6424.95s]  I'm going one step further.
[6425.67s -> 6426.39s]  Oh, it's a tunnel.
[6426.39s -> 6426.71s]  Okay.
[6427.27s -> 6431.50s]  I think it's the tunnel.
[6431.50s -> 6431.74s]  Yeah.
[6435.90s -> 6437.42s]  I want to see your combat prowess.
[6437.42s -> 6438.78s]  I want to see how good you are at this.
[6438.78s -> 6439.42s]  Oh, no.
[6441.54s -> 6442.18s]  Secret entrance?
[6448.66s -> 6448.90s]  Easy.
[6448.90s -> 6452.60s]  Looks accurate, right?
[6452.60s -> 6453.48s]  Here we go.
[6453.48s -> 6454.20s]  That was pretty sick.
[6454.20s -> 6454.44s]  All right.
[6454.44s -> 6455.80s]  Oh, they say we miss you, buddy.
[6456.44s -> 6463.05s]  We did?
[6463.05s -> 6463.61s]  Oh, here it is.
[6466.98s -> 6469.38s]  I've suggested it to you, the host.
[6469.38s -> 6470.10s]  I think we...
[6470.10s -> 6471.14s]  Yeah, we can teleport in.
[6479.37s -> 6481.61s]  Between the two of us, we can figure this out.
[6482.25s -> 6483.29s]  I'm in the tunnel.
[6483.29s -> 6487.05s]  Looks like they hit some kind of chasm during construction.
[6487.05s -> 6488.57s]  Maybe we're going to fight like aliens or something.
[6488.57s -> 6489.93s]  Chances are we'll lose comms down there.
[6489.93s -> 6490.49s]  I'll check in as soon as I can.
[6490.49s -> 6493.85s]  Jerma, they want me to ask if you're the sus guy.
[6494.41s -> 6495.37s]  You already knew that.
[6496.42s -> 6497.54s]  You're the sus guy, right?
[6497.54s -> 6498.18s]  Yeah, you knew that.
[6502.82s -> 6503.14s]  All right.
[6503.14s -> 6506.31s]  So I think we're probably going to end up fighting a bunch of stuff down here.
[6507.42s -> 6509.37s]  Oh, okay.
[6509.37s -> 6509.93s]  I'm ready.
[6510.90s -> 6513.38s]  I got the Glock and the Rari.
[6514.10s -> 6515.06s]  1738.
[6515.78s -> 6516.66s]  It's stalking me.
[6516.66s -> 6517.54s]  I don't think it's human.
[6517.54s -> 6519.54s]  It's the last message this phone received.
[6519.54s -> 6520.50s]  Okay, I'm going in.
[6520.50s -> 6521.78s]  You stay out there.
[6521.78s -> 6522.90s]  You stay safe, soldier.
[6524.66s -> 6528.26s]  I hate tight spaces because I'm such a big muscly guy.
[6535.24s -> 6537.56s]  I have no idea if I'm going in the right direction.
[6537.56s -> 6538.04s]  You are.
[6538.04s -> 6538.52s]  I think so.
[6539.16s -> 6541.61s]  You're the brains of this operation.
[6541.61s -> 6542.41s]  I'm just the brawn.
[6548.73s -> 6550.49s]  Okay, cutscene unlocked.
[6550.49s -> 6552.33s]  Do you have a cutscene too or is that just me?
[6552.33s -> 6553.61s]  Yeah, I'm watching you.
[6553.61s -> 6555.05s]  I just saw that weird alien person.
[6556.55s -> 6557.19s]  Okay.
[6557.19s -> 6557.75s]  Where are you?
[6560.20s -> 6560.60s]  Whoa.
[6561.56s -> 6562.65s]  Watch out.
[6565.50s -> 6566.38s]  You're ugly.
[6567.02s -> 6572.90s]  I just got a bloodborne villain.
[6572.90s -> 6573.54s]  I thought you were good.
[6574.26s -> 6577.96s]  You just got knocked down by a random putty.
[6577.96s -> 6579.56s]  That was a cutscene, okay?
[6579.56s -> 6582.04s]  You just got knocked down by a putty from the Power Rangers, dude.
[6582.04s -> 6582.52s]  Come on, man.
[6587.30s -> 6587.78s]  Oh, God.
[6590.34s -> 6592.02s]  Okay, I can't even land a hit on him.
[6592.02s -> 6592.58s]  Come on, get him.
[6593.14s -> 6593.54s]  You got it.
[6595.54s -> 6595.86s]  What?
[6596.58s -> 6598.02s]  He's dodging everything, Jerma.
[6598.02s -> 6599.78s]  I mean, are you pressing X?
[6602.12s -> 6604.52s]  Press X and you got to string X together.
[6605.32s -> 6607.14s]  Wait, press X?
[6607.14s -> 6607.54s]  Yeah, X.
[6607.54s -> 6608.34s]  What does X do?
[6608.34s -> 6609.30s]  X, X, X, X.
[6610.18s -> 6612.62s]  What does X do?
[6612.62s -> 6613.34s]  It's just a punch.
[6614.14s -> 6615.18s]  No, X on the swing.
[6615.18s -> 6615.66s]  Oh, no.
[6615.66s -> 6616.78s]  I'm not on a controller.
[6618.14s -> 6618.70s]  You almost got him.
[6618.70s -> 6619.18s]  You almost got him.
[6619.98s -> 6622.62s]  Why is he hitting me?
[6624.62s -> 6627.18s]  I'm just trying to find an opportunity when I should come in.
[6627.18s -> 6628.06s]  I was going to let you fight the first enemy.
[6628.06s -> 6629.50s]  I can't get a single hit on him.
[6633.43s -> 6635.11s]  It's because I'm on a keyboard, I think.
[6635.11s -> 6635.43s]  That's why.
[6635.43s -> 6636.71s]  You probably need to plug a controller.
[6636.71s -> 6637.11s]  Let me try.
[6637.11s -> 6637.75s]  Let me try to hit him.
[6642.44s -> 6644.52s]  Okay, so I don't know what was wrong with him, but my game was fine.
[6644.52s -> 6644.76s]  I mean...
[6648.86s -> 6649.34s]  See?
[6649.34s -> 6649.90s]  I'm ranged.
[6649.90s -> 6650.30s]  I'm ranged.
[6650.30s -> 6651.82s]  That's just what we were supposed to be doing.
[6651.82s -> 6653.50s]  I mean, my game seems to be working fine.
[6654.38s -> 6654.70s]  Yeah, yeah.
[6654.70s -> 6655.18s]  No, no, no.
[6655.18s -> 6655.90s]  It's just what we were...
[6655.90s -> 6656.14s]  See?
[6656.14s -> 6656.94s]  We did it together.
[6656.94s -> 6659.98s]  Like, I just hit ranged attacks and that's how we were supposed to do it.
[6660.86s -> 6663.50s]  Yeah, the guns probably are better.
[6665.19s -> 6666.23s]  Yeah, yeah.
[6666.23s -> 6666.95s]  That's what it was.
[6666.95s -> 6667.83s]  That's what we were doing.
[6668.47s -> 6672.07s]  We're probably going to have to fight a lot of those.
[6681.06s -> 6682.98s]  Wait, that was just a regular creep?
[6682.98s -> 6683.78s]  That wasn't the boss?
[6685.06s -> 6685.86s]  I don't think so.
[6686.66s -> 6687.06s]  Uh-oh.
[6687.78s -> 6688.42s]  What, are you behind us?
[6689.38s -> 6694.42s]  I look so much less intimidating next to you.
[6694.42s -> 6695.94s]  Well, you have guns and I have a slingshot.
[6695.94s -> 6697.70s]  Yeah, you have a slingshot, dude.
[6697.70s -> 6698.26s]  What is that?
[6698.26s -> 6699.54s]  Hey, watch this, you know?
[6700.50s -> 6703.08s]  All right, we got to get on the other side somehow.
[6703.80s -> 6705.51s]  Is there a way to go up?
[6714.60s -> 6714.92s]  Yeah.
[6715.72s -> 6717.50s]  In parkour?
[6718.14s -> 6719.70s]  Parkour.
[6722.33s -> 6722.73s]  Nice.
[6723.29s -> 6730.04s]  Okay, we should be able to...
[6731.40s -> 6731.80s]  Very nice.
[6732.44s -> 6740.84s]  All right, be careful.
[6742.65s -> 6743.93s]  I'm never careful.
[6743.93s -> 6746.01s]  Oh, also, you're playing keyboard and mouse, right?
[6746.65s -> 6747.29s]  Yeah.
[6747.29s -> 6749.53s]  In the lower left, you probably already know this,
[6749.53s -> 6752.33s]  but there's a button to just do an instant, like 30% heal.
[6753.45s -> 6754.33s]  Yeah, Z.
[6754.33s -> 6754.81s]  Okay, yeah.
[6754.81s -> 6755.45s]  Just want to make sure you...
[6756.09s -> 6757.29s]  Oh, no, I've been abusing it.
[6757.29s -> 6758.81s]  That's why I'm still alive, even though I...
[6759.77s -> 6780.94s]  Are you going to play this again tomorrow?
[6780.94s -> 6782.06s]  How many of you are there?
[6782.06s -> 6783.26s]  I am not.
[6783.26s -> 6784.62s]  I will not be playing this tomorrow.
[6784.62s -> 6785.18s]  Oh, no.
[6785.18s -> 6786.94s]  Who's going to carry me tomorrow, then?
[6786.94s -> 6787.34s]  Oh, no.
[6788.86s -> 6791.74s]  Bro, I can't even hit him.
[6791.74s -> 6792.54s]  I'm not even kidding.
[6792.54s -> 6793.66s]  I don't think I can hit him.
[6795.82s -> 6797.58s]  I think I might be too low.
[6797.58s -> 6799.02s]  Yeah, I'm doing like 22 damage.
[6799.02s -> 6801.34s]  Yeah, try holding the heavy attack button.
[6803.35s -> 6805.67s]  That should stun them, and then you can hit them.
[6805.67s -> 6807.85s]  I wonder if they're combo...
[6807.85s -> 6808.57s]  Are they combo moves?
[6809.29s -> 6813.83s]  I want to see if I'm cool.
[6814.47s -> 6815.86s]  Check this out.
[6823.42s -> 6826.14s]  They're very good at dodging my projectiles.
[6827.10s -> 6827.82s]  Yeah, the best...
[6827.82s -> 6829.10s]  These characters, you got to...
[6829.10s -> 6830.38s]  You hold the heavy attack button.
[6830.38s -> 6832.46s]  Whatever your range attack button is, hold it.
[6832.46s -> 6833.26s]  Oh, God, I'm dead.
[6833.82s -> 6834.86s]  I got you, don't worry.
[6834.86s -> 6835.98s]  I'm respawning at two.
[6837.10s -> 6837.42s]  One.
[6838.38s -> 6839.66s]  I can't pick you up.
[6839.66s -> 6839.90s]  Why?
[6839.90s -> 6841.10s]  No, I have to do it myself.
[6845.43s -> 6846.15s]  Wait, what?
[6846.15s -> 6846.79s]  Where does I...
[6846.79s -> 6847.67s]  Where do I respawn?
[6847.67s -> 6847.99s]  Okay.
[6848.71s -> 6859.18s]  Come on, we can't lose to the putties.
[6864.54s -> 6865.42s]  Oh, I killed one.
[6865.42s -> 6865.98s]  Nice job.
[6865.98s -> 6866.38s]  Let's go.
[6867.02s -> 6867.90s]  All right, so what's your...
[6867.90s -> 6869.90s]  Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[6875.13s -> 6875.85s]  That's for me.
[6875.85s -> 6876.25s]  All right, let's do...
[6876.25s -> 6877.37s]  Can we do a pose?
[6877.37s -> 6878.25s]  Let's do a pose together.
[6878.97s -> 6881.45s]  On the count of three, let's do your favorite emote on the count of three
[6881.45s -> 6882.17s]  because I want a picture.
[6883.13s -> 6885.37s]  Okay, let's do it.
[6885.37s -> 6886.09s]  I'm ready.
[6886.09s -> 6887.53s]  One, two, three.
[6892.10s -> 6893.06s]  That's fucking cool.
[6893.06s -> 6893.86s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[6895.46s -> 6897.74s]  I actually look so cool right now.
[6897.74s -> 6898.86s]  You do look very cool.
[6899.50s -> 6904.02s]  I want a better frame.
[6904.42s -> 6908.63s]  There we go.
[6908.63s -> 6909.03s]  Perfect.
[6910.30s -> 6910.54s]  Nice.
[6911.18s -> 6911.66s]  Nice.
[6912.38s -> 6914.49s]  All right, but what's your range attack button?
[6917.00s -> 6918.68s]  Right click and then left click
[6918.68s -> 6922.66s]  or Q for range attacks or...
[6923.30s -> 6923.70s]  That one.
[6926.18s -> 6927.78s]  Hold Q for heavy attack.
[6927.78s -> 6929.06s]  So that one, you want to...
[6929.06s -> 6930.66s]  That's the only way you can hurt these guys.
[6931.30s -> 6932.02s]  Oh, really?
[6932.02s -> 6934.10s]  Yeah, so you have to hold it, hit somebody with it,
[6934.10s -> 6936.42s]  and then they stunned enough for you to do the melee damage to them.
[6938.10s -> 6938.90s]  Okay, got it.
[6939.54s -> 6941.94s]  They are also level nine and I'm level three.
[6941.94s -> 6942.98s]  That's also true.
[6942.98s -> 6944.90s]  Yeah, you are kind of under levels for this.
[6944.90s -> 6945.30s]  So am I.
[6946.10s -> 6947.22s]  What am I, seven, six?
[6947.86s -> 6952.92s]  People are yelling at me saying it was on my screen.
[6953.64s -> 6957.59s]  Need my attention.
[6957.59s -> 6961.26s]  All right, almost up there.
[6965.64s -> 6967.32s]  These guys got nothing on us.
[6973.99s -> 6975.59s]  That's actually not a bad impression.
[6975.59s -> 6976.55s]  That actually sounds pretty good.
[6977.43s -> 6980.26s]  All right, we're going to find research items.
[6980.90s -> 6983.50s]  It's my job.
[6984.87s -> 6987.03s]  Very good at finding research items.
[6987.83s -> 6988.15s]  Sample.
[6988.79s -> 6990.63s]  I think these are the research items.
[6991.27s -> 6994.18s]  This is some giant slim gyms.
[6994.98s -> 6998.18s]  This is a spectrographic analyzer.
[6998.18s -> 7000.66s]  Spectrographic analyzer.
[7002.28s -> 7003.32s]  I got a chest over here.
[7005.13s -> 7006.73s]  I've never even seen a chest yet.
[7008.63s -> 7009.35s]  Did you get the item?
[7009.35s -> 7014.50s]  Ooh, I think I got some green stuff.
[7016.04s -> 7017.56s]  Yeah, it's crafting material.
[7017.56s -> 7021.72s]  So eventually you have enough to make new weapons and suits and stuff.
[7022.44s -> 7025.80s]  Seems like we need to open up this extraction room.
[7025.80s -> 7028.36s]  I think we have to find two more pieces of research.
[7029.08s -> 7032.38s]  Which it looks like over here.
[7033.50s -> 7035.34s]  Oh, no, it's back here.
[7035.34s -> 7036.54s]  What's this stuff?
[7037.98s -> 7041.90s]  More x-ray analyzer and more ore samples.
[7041.90s -> 7043.26s]  Is this going to be an insanely hard?
[7043.26s -> 7044.54s]  This looks like a difficult puzzle.
[7048.76s -> 7049.56s]  Where'd you go?
[7049.56s -> 7050.20s]  What are you doing?
[7050.20s -> 7050.92s]  We opened it.
[7050.92s -> 7051.80s]  That's it.
[7051.80s -> 7052.76s]  Oh, it's down a level.
[7052.76s -> 7055.08s]  There was a thing down there.
[7055.08s -> 7058.39s]  It's a rock climbing wall.
[7058.39s -> 7059.35s]  Oh, whoops.
[7063.61s -> 7064.89s]  Rookie mistake.
[7064.89s -> 7065.85s]  It's not a big deal.
[7067.67s -> 7069.27s]  I'll keep us grounded.
[7069.91s -> 7070.87s]  Oh, I fell.
[7072.23s -> 7075.11s]  By grounded, I mean literally in the ground.
[7075.11s -> 7076.07s]  Rookie mistake.
[7077.56s -> 7077.96s]  What?
[7077.96s -> 7079.40s]  I will do Red Hood now.
[7079.40s -> 7080.52s]  Where are you off to?
[7081.56s -> 7081.88s]  What?
[7082.60s -> 7083.45s]  Oh, you're back.
[7084.25s -> 7085.69s]  That was pretty sus.
[7089.35s -> 7090.31s]  Oh, my God.
[7090.31s -> 7091.19s]  I fell again.
[7096.25s -> 7097.05s]  All right.
[7097.61s -> 7098.09s]  You made it.
[7099.86s -> 7100.58s]  You made it.
[7104.20s -> 7106.44s]  I think the game got sick of you falling.
[7106.44s -> 7107.08s]  Just put you there.
[7109.82s -> 7112.38s]  Computer from a crown to all.
[7112.38s -> 7115.82s]  I did some tinkering and went back to some older composite samples.
[7115.82s -> 7119.82s]  Turns out what we thought was waste ore just needed a different extraction treatment.
[7119.82s -> 7121.18s]  The carbonic acid.
[7121.18s -> 7123.18s]  They're just making words up now.
[7123.18s -> 7124.54s]  Carbonic acid.
[7124.54s -> 7125.04s]  Carbonic.
[7126.06s -> 7127.67s]  It's nerd stuff.
[7127.67s -> 7128.63s]  Don't worry about it.
[7128.63s -> 7130.39s]  Hey, I'm a nerd here.
[7130.39s -> 7131.11s]  I've come on.
[7131.67s -> 7132.92s]  All right.
[7132.92s -> 7135.72s]  So this is samples have got to tell me something about what's going on.
[7135.72s -> 7136.84s]  Oh, it's another piece together.
[7136.84s -> 7137.40s]  The mystery.
[7139.75s -> 7140.07s]  All right.
[7140.07s -> 7141.11s]  I'll leave this up to you.
[7141.11s -> 7142.71s]  The brains of the operation.
[7142.71s -> 7144.95s]  Which sample should be placed in the extractor?
[7144.95s -> 7147.75s]  Which chemical will extract material from the sample?
[7147.75s -> 7148.23s]  Interesting.
[7150.76s -> 7155.16s]  Well, this is composite ore, which the holes in it would indicate that it's already been
[7155.16s -> 7156.12s]  extracted.
[7156.12s -> 7157.24s]  So I don't think it's this one.
[7158.94s -> 7159.90s]  Hmm.
[7159.90s -> 7164.44s]  A note on the sample reads reacts poorly to all previous extraction methods.
[7164.44s -> 7164.84s]  No sample.
[7164.84s -> 7168.90s]  I think it's marble 1063.
[7168.90s -> 7170.10s]  Um, what?
[7170.10s -> 7172.14s]  I don't know.
[7172.14s -> 7173.02s]  I just wanted to say.
[7173.02s -> 7174.46s]  Oh, you clicked on this one already.
[7174.46s -> 7177.43s]  All right.
[7177.43s -> 7179.27s]  So we need to actually figure this out.
[7179.27s -> 7181.35s]  So which sample should be placed in the extractor?
[7181.35s -> 7181.83s]  This one?
[7181.83s -> 7182.47s]  No.
[7182.47s -> 7183.35s]  It's already been used.
[7184.41s -> 7185.85s]  I hate science.
[7188.78s -> 7190.86s]  And can you back away Red Hood a little bit?
[7190.86s -> 7193.40s]  Your breath is fucking awful.
[7193.40s -> 7197.72s]  Listen, didn't have time to brush my teeth before we ran outside today.
[7198.60s -> 7199.72s]  No sample extracted.
[7200.78s -> 7202.38s]  Hasn't hasn't been extracted yet.
[7202.94s -> 7205.27s]  This one here.
[7205.27s -> 7207.83s]  Which chemical will extract material from the sample?
[7209.77s -> 7219.14s]  I didn't think you'd be able to smell my breath from under the mask.
[7219.14s -> 7232.50s]  How do I find out what the element is?
[7233.62s -> 7234.34s]  Which chemical?
[7234.90s -> 7239.13s]  Which chemical would it be?
[7239.13s -> 7244.62s]  How do I select it?
[7244.62s -> 7247.22s]  Okay.
[7247.22s -> 7249.78s]  If you can't figure it out, then there was no shot.
[7249.78s -> 7250.74s]  I was going to figure it out.
[7250.74s -> 7252.42s]  You're the nerd on this team.
[7252.42s -> 7253.46s]  Stop, stop, stop it.
[7254.84s -> 7258.22s]  Uh, where's the I'm trying to work Red Hood.
[7259.37s -> 7261.13s]  Which chemical will extract material from the sample?
[7261.13s -> 7262.57s]  Is that a mechanical keyboard?
[7262.57s -> 7263.77s]  Seems like a real gamer.
[7263.77s -> 7266.17s]  WASD keys are actually highlighted.
[7266.17s -> 7267.45s]  I wish Batgirl was here.
[7267.45s -> 7268.73s]  I wish Batgirl was here instead of you.
[7271.43s -> 7272.63s]  How can't I put any chemicals here?
[7277.37s -> 7278.49s]  Is there a list of the chemicals?
[7278.49s -> 7279.85s]  I don't see them anywhere.
[7279.85s -> 7280.89s]  I think that was a bit mean.
[7281.69s -> 7282.73s]  You just said right there.
[7283.98s -> 7288.33s]  I mean the breathing is fine, but you know how I feel about Batgirl.
[7291.93s -> 7293.29s]  Where's the list of chemicals?
[7294.28s -> 7295.64s]  Maybe the email?
[7295.64s -> 7298.28s]  Yeah, I can't click the email.
[7298.28s -> 7299.96s]  Sulfuric acid worked perfectly.
[7299.96s -> 7301.16s]  So where's sulfuric acid?
[7301.16s -> 7302.68s]  Is sulfuric acid here somewhere?
[7302.68s -> 7303.56s]  Oh, Jesus.
[7304.36s -> 7306.49s]  It's all right, Red Hood.
[7306.49s -> 7306.97s]  I got this.
[7307.77s -> 7309.93s]  We just didn't look one inch to our left.
[7310.65s -> 7311.13s]  That's my bad.
[7311.13s -> 7311.85s]  I'm supposed to be the brains.
[7313.13s -> 7313.63s]  Yeah.
[7314.65s -> 7318.01s]  I apologize for everything I just said about telling you to get away from me and everything.
[7318.01s -> 7321.05s]  Are you loving this as much as I am?
[7321.05s -> 7322.97s]  No, I'm not.
[7326.23s -> 7326.63s]  I got it.
[7326.63s -> 7327.43s]  Okay, we're good.
[7328.90s -> 7330.98s]  I was just about to shoot this nerd thing.
[7337.26s -> 7338.62s]  That sounds made up.
[7338.62s -> 7342.52s]  I'm not the only one who hasn't heard of it.
[7342.52s -> 7345.45s]  We should get another photo.
[7345.45s -> 7346.73s]  Everyone wants me to say this.
[7346.73s -> 7347.69s]  I don't know why.
[7347.69s -> 7348.19s]  Scorn.
[7349.27s -> 7350.15s]  You shouldn't have said that.
[7350.87s -> 7351.37s]  Why?
[7352.46s -> 7354.46s]  Just saying you've infected your channel now.
[7356.34s -> 7356.90s]  Wait, what?
[7356.90s -> 7357.78s]  With what?
[7357.78s -> 7358.28s]  Scorn.
[7359.38s -> 7361.62s]  Guys, there's a new Scorn streamer here.
[7362.50s -> 7363.38s]  He's in the call right now.
[7365.70s -> 7366.82s]  I've never played that.
[7368.36s -> 7369.16s]  Well, now you have to.
[7369.96s -> 7375.24s]  I'm actually playing Gotham Knights.
[7378.89s -> 7384.17s]  A brand new open world third person or action RPG featuring the Batman family.
[7384.17s -> 7387.69s]  You can step into the roles of Batgirl, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin
[7387.69s -> 7391.77s]  and rise up as the new protectors of Gotham City in the wake of Batman's death.
[7392.33s -> 7395.93s]  You can also customize your night with new gear and looks as you play through all the
[7395.93s -> 7401.53s]  new original story solo or an online co-op with a friend like Jerma.
[7401.53s -> 7402.25s]  Like we're doing right now.
[7402.81s -> 7406.57s]  Like we're doing right now and come face to face with some of the most infamous
[7406.57s -> 7411.53s]  villains in DC's Batman universe such as Mr. Freeze, Harley Quinn,
[7411.53s -> 7414.89s]  Spoiler Alert, Clayface, and Mysterious Court of Owls.
[7415.45s -> 7419.77s]  Gotham Knights is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, X, and the PC.
[7420.49s -> 7423.21s]  It really looks like your character is sitting there talking into a camera.
[7425.32s -> 7425.80s]  Yeah.
[7425.80s -> 7426.28s]  Right there.
[7426.28s -> 7427.16s]  Because he is.
[7428.12s -> 7431.19s]  But everything you just said was true.
[7431.75s -> 7432.63s]  Is there a co-op experience?
[7432.63s -> 7434.95s]  Batman is dead and also he's Bruce Wayne.
[7437.08s -> 7440.52s]  Uh, there's an absolutely amazing part.
[7440.52s -> 7443.48s]  I don't know if you'll see it or whatever, but I forget how far into it it is.
[7443.48s -> 7444.20s]  It's absolutely hilarious.
[7444.20s -> 7445.56s]  It's probably the best part of the entire game.
[7446.44s -> 7448.60s]  So, um, Batman sends an email.
[7449.32s -> 7451.32s]  This is a spoiler, by the way, but it's hilarious.
[7451.32s -> 7454.28s]  So Batman sends an email out to like all the Gotham Knights.
[7454.84s -> 7457.56s]  He's like, oh, hey, I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this.
[7457.56s -> 7463.08s]  Um, it seems to me that Bruce Wayne and Batman are Google trending right now.
[7463.08s -> 7465.00s]  So I feel like people know who I am.
[7465.56s -> 7469.96s]  He actually says that search trending like he's trending as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
[7470.76s -> 7471.80s]  He's a bit of a boomer.
[7473.00s -> 7475.88s]  Yeah, but that was like my favorite part of the entire game so far.
[7475.88s -> 7478.12s]  There's nothing wrong with being a boomer.
[7478.12s -> 7479.48s]  All right, let's go.
[7479.48s -> 7484.28s]  He looks up his name and Batman and sees that like the trend line for searches has gone up.
[7484.28s -> 7486.68s]  So he's like, oh shit, I've been compromised.
[7486.68s -> 7487.40s]  That's how he knows.
[7489.62s -> 7490.82s]  Suggesting that the ho.
[7504.68s -> 7506.84s]  There is everything wrong with being a boomer.
[7507.93s -> 7508.65s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[7508.65s -> 7509.45s]  Oh, are you saying that?
[7509.45s -> 7511.69s]  Wow, they're being ages.
[7511.69s -> 7512.49s]  They're being ages.
[7515.59s -> 7522.90s]  Oh, it's clear you don't understand your place.
[7525.37s -> 7530.33s]  Dog, you're a dude in an owl head.
[7532.60s -> 7534.52s]  We are the protectors, not you.
[7534.52s -> 7534.68s]  What?
[7537.72s -> 7538.68s]  Well, that's a load of shit.
[7539.64s -> 7549.26s]  Don't you think you'd want to press that when you leave?
[7551.54s -> 7554.18s]  Yeah, doesn't that hurt his own owl guys?
[7554.18s -> 7557.32s]  Yeah, and I think I want to be in the cut scene.
[7557.32s -> 7558.36s]  I'm not in the cut scene.
[7559.40s -> 7561.67s]  I pressed it.
[7561.67s -> 7563.91s]  So we're going to get the fuck out of here now.
[7563.91s -> 7564.39s]  Are you ready?
[7565.66s -> 7566.94s]  Yeah, I'm going to do the cute thing now.
[7567.66s -> 7575.59s]  All right, we got to do superhero talking to each other like in every movie.
[7576.82s -> 7579.46s]  Okay, I'm not able to use the ocean.
[7579.46s -> 7579.86s]  Oh, God.
[7579.86s -> 7580.74s]  Red Hood 6 o'clock.
[7582.84s -> 7583.40s]  Bullseye.
[7584.28s -> 7587.72s]  Oh, that was mine, man.
[7587.72s -> 7588.28s]  I died.
[7588.84s -> 7594.84s]  I can't help you up.
[7594.84s -> 7596.04s]  Wait, I can respawn.
[7596.04s -> 7598.68s]  I don't know why it just it wouldn't let me know.
[7599.40s -> 7600.12s]  Oh, I'm good.
[7600.12s -> 7600.84s]  I'm good again.
[7600.84s -> 7601.48s]  I respawn.
[7602.60s -> 7603.32s]  Oh, God.
[7603.32s -> 7604.84s]  Okay, they're spawn camping.
[7605.56s -> 7611.88s]  Oh, my God.
[7611.88s -> 7613.00s]  These guys are kind of tough, actually.
[7613.56s -> 7615.29s]  Oh, God.
[7615.29s -> 7615.77s]  I'm going to fall.
[7616.49s -> 7620.30s]  There's a button prompt and I don't know what button it is.
[7620.30s -> 7622.22s]  It just flashes way too quickly.
[7623.10s -> 7623.58s]  It's dodge.
[7624.22s -> 7627.42s]  So you see like when their hands kind of light up with a circle around it.
[7627.42s -> 7629.90s]  When the circle lights up, that means you can do a perfect evade.
[7630.30s -> 7631.50s]  I don't think you can put a point in it.
[7631.50s -> 7644.70s]  No, it's not it.
[7644.70s -> 7645.26s]  Here we go.
[7645.90s -> 7648.78s]  Okay, I have to actually right click because it doesn't auto aim.
[7649.50s -> 7651.26s]  Possibly because of the PC.
[7651.26s -> 7651.74s]  Probably.
[7651.74s -> 7652.62s]  What was that?
[7652.62s -> 7653.02s]  What is that?
[7653.02s -> 7654.22s]  The Ghost of Nightwing?
[7654.22s -> 7654.78s]  What the hell?
[7660.04s -> 7660.44s]  What do you got?
[7660.44s -> 7661.56s]  A spirit bomb?
[7661.56s -> 7662.20s]  What is that?
[7662.20s -> 7663.88s]  The Ghost of Nightwing.
[7667.10s -> 7667.66s]  Nice job.
[7667.66s -> 7668.86s]  Oh, you killed him.
[7668.86s -> 7670.14s]  I killed him, actually.
[7670.14s -> 7670.70s]  That was me.
[7670.70s -> 7676.78s]  Oh, we're going down, man.
[7676.78s -> 7677.42s]  We're going down.
[7680.95s -> 7682.07s]  We're going down, Goku.
[7683.90s -> 7686.06s]  Well, I guess they're going down with us.
[7687.02s -> 7692.62s]  No, we're good.
[7701.35s -> 7702.71s]  Not in the cutscene, Sag.
[7703.59s -> 7709.61s]  I think I'm just about done with Talons, thank you.
[7712.46s -> 7713.66s]  The mines are collapsing.
[7713.66s -> 7714.46s]  Oh, it is collapsing.
[7717.58s -> 7720.14s]  This is not what I was expecting to be for our Saturday afternoon.
[7721.10s -> 7721.90s]  Are we running?
[7721.90s -> 7722.46s]  I'm running.
[7723.50s -> 7724.46s]  I'm not fighting.
[7724.46s -> 7725.18s]  I'm running.
[7726.54s -> 7729.18s]  Hey, when we get back, promise me you'll do the cooking.
[7730.44s -> 7732.44s]  Is that you talking or is that Robin?
[7732.44s -> 7732.68s]  What?
[7734.55s -> 7737.59s]  I've been saying hi to the chat for a minute or two.
[7738.23s -> 7741.43s]  Wait, it just says, when we get back, promise you'll do the cooking.
[7742.65s -> 7745.02s]  I was muted.
[7745.82s -> 7751.50s]  Wait, is that actually him?
[7753.75s -> 7753.99s]  Yeah.
[7754.79s -> 7761.82s]  Am I being ghastly right now?
[7761.82s -> 7763.18s]  That is pretty sus of you, dude.
[7763.90s -> 7766.46s]  Yeah, I was being kind of sus.
[7767.50s -> 7768.78s]  Damn, you were sussy.
[7772.66s -> 7774.18s]  Wait, can you do that again for real?
[7775.99s -> 7777.59s]  Uh, it has to be in the moment.
[7777.59s -> 7778.39s]  I'm a method actor.
[7784.90s -> 7786.02s]  I hate cave-ins.
[7786.82s -> 7792.26s]  Guess we got to go up now.
[7793.94s -> 7794.34s]  Okay.
[7795.14s -> 7797.48s]  That was a bad line, I'm sorry.
[7799.64s -> 7800.68s]  And I didn't even do it.
[7800.68s -> 7801.08s]  Okay.
[7802.12s -> 7803.32s]  Okay, okay.
[7804.36s -> 7807.50s]  All right, let's switch roles now.
[7807.50s -> 7809.02s]  You do Robin and I'll do Red Hood.
[7809.42s -> 7810.54s]  I can't do Robin.
[7812.68s -> 7815.98s]  I think I can probably do a pretty good Red Hood.
[7815.98s -> 7817.50s]  I sure hope so.
[7817.50s -> 7820.46s]  Okay, that sounds very scorn-like.
[7821.50s -> 7822.22s]  Maybe a little.
[7825.61s -> 7826.81s]  Why do you sound hungry?
[7829.05s -> 7831.91s]  Oh, up here.
[7831.91s -> 7832.63s]  I'm up here.
[7832.63s -> 7835.27s]  I'm looking forward to chopping those carrots later on.
[7835.27s -> 7836.55s]  It's a long ride up.
[7838.41s -> 7840.33s]  Shut up, Robin, you fucking idiot.
[7843.94s -> 7846.98s]  Listen, Red Hood, just because you're so sexy and muscular
[7846.98s -> 7849.96s]  doesn't mean you can bully me like that.
[7850.76s -> 7851.56s]  Oh, well, I have to see.
[7851.56s -> 7853.08s]  But I like it.
[7853.08s -> 7855.08s]  We did a really good job together.
[7856.12s -> 7856.68s]  You and I.
[7856.68s -> 7859.88s]  You sound a lot like that conspiracy guy, Alex Jones.
[7859.88s -> 7860.92s]  I just want to tell you, look,
[7861.72s -> 7862.92s]  what you need to understand,
[7862.92s -> 7865.08s]  it's not, I'm not, it's not, don't listen to me.
[7865.08s -> 7868.95s]  Belfry, can you hear me?
[7868.95s -> 7871.59s]  When we get back, when we get back to the Belfry,
[7871.59s -> 7873.51s]  I'm going to eat as much meat as I can.
[7873.51s -> 7875.83s]  I'm going to eat, and I'm going to have children.
[7875.83s -> 7878.55s]  The court is mining the strange element I've never heard of.
[7878.63s -> 7880.31s]  Here we are, we have you.
[7883.98s -> 7884.78s]  Are you still there?
[7885.74s -> 7886.62s]  Belfry.
[7886.62s -> 7887.90s]  Oh, no, where's Belfry?
[7889.74s -> 7890.46s]  How are we going to go back?
[7895.02s -> 7897.02s]  Whatever you do, do not punch this person.
[7897.02s -> 7897.58s]  Don't do it.
[7897.58s -> 7899.10s]  I'm telling you right now, you better not.
[7899.90s -> 7900.40s]  Where?
[7902.02s -> 7903.06s]  This guy?
[7903.06s -> 7904.10s]  You better not.
[7904.10s -> 7904.58s]  Don't do it.
[7905.38s -> 7906.10s]  You're under arrest.
[7906.74s -> 7908.50s]  All right, stop.
[7908.50s -> 7909.94s]  Actually, stop it.
[7909.94s -> 7910.90s]  Stop it.
[7910.90s -> 7911.30s]  Stop.
[7911.30s -> 7912.34s]  I'm getting out of here.
[7912.34s -> 7912.98s]  I'm getting out of here.
[7912.98s -> 7913.94s]  This is not on my stream.
[7913.94s -> 7914.42s]  I'm out of here.
[7915.46s -> 7917.38s]  I thought you told me to punch the person.
[7918.02s -> 7918.74s]  I said, don't.
[7921.98s -> 7923.10s]  I misunderstood.
[7925.67s -> 7927.59s]  You tell me to punch, I say, how hard?
[7928.23s -> 7933.18s]  All right, we're going to go talk to Talia Al Ghul.
[7933.90s -> 7938.23s]  I'm a bit of a anti-hero.
[7938.23s -> 7938.55s]  You know what?
[7938.55s -> 7941.58s]  Let's do, oh, my game's just turned off.
[7941.58s -> 7947.21s]  Oops.
[7947.21s -> 7947.45s]  What?
[7947.45s -> 7950.15s]  Are we still on the call?
[7950.15s -> 7950.65s]  Yeah.
[7952.31s -> 7952.87s]  What?
[7952.87s -> 7953.67s]  I'm going up.
[7954.39s -> 7955.83s]  I think I'm going to have to join you.
[7955.83s -> 7958.41s]  Wait, are you still in my game?
[7958.41s -> 7961.66s]  Wait, I just lost.
[7961.74s -> 7964.41s]  Connection to the game session.
[7964.41s -> 7968.65s]  Yeah, I think it just booted us, I think.
[7968.65s -> 7969.61s]  Wait, why did that happen?
[7972.57s -> 7972.97s]  Internet.
[7972.97s -> 7976.41s]  OK, well, on that note, I think, I mean, wait, hold on.
[7977.98s -> 7979.10s]  When did you start playing?
[7981.82s -> 7982.86s]  I don't know, like a couple hours ago.
[7983.42s -> 7983.90s]  Oh, OK.
[7984.94s -> 7985.82s]  Do you want to keep going?
[7985.82s -> 7991.16s]  Because I was just going to end it here.
[7991.16s -> 7992.79s]  Oh, OK.
[7992.79s -> 7997.59s]  Yeah, I'm going to play for like another 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[7998.15s -> 8001.11s]  If you want, I'll play more with you.
[8001.11s -> 8003.67s]  Do you want to keep playing?
[8003.67s -> 8005.51s]  Yeah, I'll play 20 more minutes.
[8005.51s -> 8008.55s]  Let's do at least a couple of crimes on the street.
[8008.55s -> 8012.01s]  Wait, I wonder if it's because I shot the civilians.
[8012.01s -> 8012.73s]  No.
[8012.73s -> 8018.70s]  Let's do a little bit more.
[8018.70s -> 8019.82s]  You come with me this time.
[8019.82s -> 8020.86s]  You come with me on a mission.
[8020.86s -> 8023.26s]  All right, yeah, that's probably better because then I can actually carry
[8023.26s -> 8027.69s]  because I'm going to be like four or five levels higher than you.
[8027.69s -> 8028.01s]  OK.
[8028.65s -> 8029.69s]  So let me go to social.
[8030.25s -> 8032.01s]  Wait, why isn't it showing up on recent?
[8032.01s -> 8032.49s]  Oh.
[8032.49s -> 8032.97s]  Friends.
[8033.96s -> 8035.32s]  In-game friends, it doesn't say.
[8035.32s -> 8037.05s]  Are you offline?
[8037.05s -> 8037.55s]  No.
[8038.34s -> 8038.74s]  Hold on.
[8038.74s -> 8042.95s]  I'm just are you offline?
[8042.95s -> 8045.80s]  No.
[8045.80s -> 8046.52s]  Can you invite me?
[8046.52s -> 8049.80s]  You're not you're not showing up on my list.
[8052.62s -> 8055.90s]  Oh, no, it says, OK, invite player.
[8055.90s -> 8058.23s]  Oh, there you go.
[8058.23s -> 8060.31s]  Invite casket to your game.
[8060.31s -> 8060.87s]  Let's go.
[8061.43s -> 8062.39s]  Did it work?
[8062.39s -> 8063.85s]  Can you hear me?
[8065.26s -> 8066.22s]  I mean, I invited you.
[8067.02s -> 8068.06s]  I wonder if it was it through.
[8068.06s -> 8068.54s]  Oh, it's through.
[8068.54s -> 8070.36s]  OK, it was through steam.
[8070.36s -> 8070.76s]  I see.
[8070.76s -> 8071.88s]  Yeah, it's through steam friends.
[8072.44s -> 8073.40s]  OK, coming in.
[8073.40s -> 8081.62s]  So let's play for like another 25, 30 minutes or so, 20 minutes.
[8081.62s -> 8086.63s]  I mean, you know, Warner Brothers is obviously sponsoring the stream.
[8086.63s -> 8088.23s]  So let's showcase what we can.
[8088.23s -> 8089.58s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8089.58s -> 8091.02s]  Hey, there you are.
[8091.02s -> 8093.42s]  God, you look like such a freaking nerd.
[8099.90s -> 8100.46s]  Little guy.
[8102.52s -> 8104.12s]  Wait, can you change your casual gear?
[8104.68s -> 8106.20s]  I don't think you can change the casual gear.
[8109.88s -> 8111.32s]  So this is your game.
[8111.32s -> 8112.44s]  So am I still level?
[8113.08s -> 8115.82s]  I'm still level eight.
[8115.82s -> 8116.46s]  So.
[8116.46s -> 8123.56s]  Oh, my God, the talent gear is soon.
[8123.56s -> 8125.24s]  Wait, I have different demon.
[8125.24s -> 8126.44s]  I have different ones here.
[8127.24s -> 8127.48s]  Yeah.
[8127.48s -> 8128.12s]  No, I don't.
[8128.12s -> 8128.76s]  Shinobi.
[8128.76s -> 8129.24s]  No, no, no.
[8129.24s -> 8130.12s]  It's the same ones.
[8130.12s -> 8132.36s]  As you level up, you unlock more suits and stuff.
[8132.36s -> 8138.62s]  Well, how do I get to this one?
[8138.62s -> 8139.58s]  I actually like that.
[8139.58s -> 8141.66s]  When I do the decoy, the elemental residue.
[8141.66s -> 8142.62s]  That's pretty cool to me.
[8143.26s -> 8148.15s]  I'm going to take a look at the workbench here.
[8149.70s -> 8150.02s]  You should.
[8150.02s -> 8151.22s]  I don't have a suit.
[8152.71s -> 8154.23s]  I don't have anything for suit.
[8154.23s -> 8156.07s]  I only have stuff for melee.
[8156.79s -> 8162.79s]  Like I can craft a stealth pistol and I'm doing all that,
[8162.79s -> 8165.67s]  but I want to do it so I can like actually change my suit.
[8165.67s -> 8166.63s]  But I can't.
[8166.63s -> 8168.47s]  It only says apply transmog.
[8168.47s -> 8170.79s]  Does that mean it's unlockable?
[8172.04s -> 8172.44s]  All right.
[8172.44s -> 8176.04s]  So does it say crafting ready underneath it?
[8176.04s -> 8176.76s]  Oh, no.
[8176.76s -> 8178.68s]  So you don't have enough materials.
[8178.68s -> 8183.70s]  Joe, why are you guys saying you have other gear to equip?
[8184.34s -> 8190.26s]  If you get out of this and just go hold down whatever to get to that menu.
[8190.26s -> 8195.46s]  Like one and go to gear just like out of the workbench and then go to suit
[8196.28s -> 8197.32s]  and then go to melee.
[8197.72s -> 8199.88s]  It's the same thing, but you probably have a couple things to switch out.
[8203.78s -> 8204.58s]  Okay, suit.
[8205.22s -> 8206.66s]  I have the beyond suit on.
[8208.54s -> 8209.90s]  You might have other guns too.
[8214.06s -> 8214.62s]  Last hurrah.
[8214.62s -> 8216.46s]  Yeah, I'll do nightwing last hurrah.
[8216.46s -> 8218.84s]  It's my favorite character.
[8218.84s -> 8222.50s]  I want to play more bad girl though.
[8222.50s -> 8223.14s]  Bad girl is cool.
[8226.95s -> 8229.51s]  Oh, your stats are being decreased to match the hose.
[8229.51s -> 8230.63s]  They are.
[8230.63s -> 8231.35s]  Oh, shit.
[8231.35s -> 8231.67s]  Okay.
[8232.39s -> 8234.55s]  Well, I mean, that makes sense.
[8234.55s -> 8237.64s]  But yeah, that makes sense.
[8238.60s -> 8240.60s]  Okay, I have a stock suit and a beyond suit.
[8240.60s -> 8243.32s]  That's it on gear.
[8243.32s -> 8244.92s]  That's the only two things I have.
[8245.56s -> 8248.94s]  And I guess I can try this.
[8248.94s -> 8250.14s]  Yeah, with different styles.
[8250.70s -> 8253.85s]  I've been waiting to do this ability.
[8253.85s -> 8254.65s]  This is gonna be awesome.
[8265.53s -> 8266.09s]  Hold on.
[8267.48s -> 8270.44s]  Okay, Batman's last case, weird science.
[8270.44s -> 8271.24s]  Should we do that one?
[8271.24s -> 8272.84s]  Is that what you want to do?
[8272.84s -> 8274.28s]  Yeah, or we could even just walk around the city
[8274.28s -> 8276.76s]  and just do like the kind of random events.
[8277.40s -> 8280.50s]  I feel like that would take about 20 minutes or so,
[8280.50s -> 8281.86s]  not like 30, 40 minutes.
[8283.30s -> 8283.80s]  Okay.
[8284.98s -> 8286.10s]  Wait, hold on.
[8286.10s -> 8286.60s]  Melee.
[8287.69s -> 8290.49s]  We might actually have to be out for you to put new stuff on.
[8290.49s -> 8293.62s]  I wonder if I can craft something.
[8300.20s -> 8301.64s]  I cannot.
[8301.64s -> 8305.72s]  I guess I can't.
[8311.96s -> 8316.12s]  Oh, I have the beyond suit now.
[8316.12s -> 8318.12s]  I think you were in that before, were you?
[8318.92s -> 8321.32s]  Yeah, but it just like it changed it.
[8324.76s -> 8327.16s]  Oh, styles.
[8331.02s -> 8334.70s]  I can do new guard on the beyond suit.
[8334.70s -> 8335.34s]  That's it.
[8338.15s -> 8339.91s]  I can do night watch.
[8339.91s -> 8341.11s]  I mean, I like night watch.
[8341.11s -> 8342.38s]  It's fine.
[8342.38s -> 8344.06s]  I want shinobi, but it won't let me.
[8344.06s -> 8345.10s]  And night ops, I can't.
[8349.77s -> 8352.81s]  Metal is sick, privateer, demon, neon, nor.
[8353.93s -> 8357.05s]  Batgirl, he's talking to himself again.
[8357.05s -> 8360.18s]  No, I'm talking to you as well, but...
[8360.74s -> 8363.35s]  Batgirl, I don't mean...
[8363.99s -> 8369.85s]  Who is he talking to?
[8370.73s -> 8371.85s]  I'm just talking to you.
[8371.85s -> 8373.13s]  Do people say that in your chat?
[8374.47s -> 8375.19s]  All the time.
[8375.19s -> 8377.51s]  After you go on, like you talk for like 10 straight minutes,
[8377.51s -> 8379.43s]  people just go like, who is he talking to?
[8379.43s -> 8380.23s]  Who are you talking to?
[8387.51s -> 8390.49s]  All right, let's try to do a crime.
[8390.49s -> 8392.60s]  You know what I mean?
[8392.60s -> 8393.40s]  Shopping again.
[8393.40s -> 8394.20s]  That's what he's doing.
[8394.20s -> 8394.68s]  That's true.
[8394.68s -> 8395.80s]  I am shopping.
[8395.80s -> 8397.72s]  I do be shopping a lot.
[8397.72s -> 8403.48s]  Did you say let's do a crime?
[8403.48s -> 8405.00s]  I meant, yeah, you know what I mean?
[8405.64s -> 8407.72s]  You meant let's stop a crime.
[8407.72s -> 8409.16s]  Okay, Batman's last case.
[8412.28s -> 8413.00s]  You don't want to do that.
[8413.00s -> 8414.68s]  You want to do just regular, huh?
[8414.68s -> 8416.28s]  Um, I'm down for it.
[8416.28s -> 8417.40s]  I think it'd probably be easier.
[8417.40s -> 8419.32s]  It'd be less time if we did just the stuff on the street.
[8420.18s -> 8422.42s]  Okay, you lead the way then.
[8422.42s -> 8423.94s]  Or do I have to lead the way?
[8423.94s -> 8425.06s]  I think because you're the host,
[8425.06s -> 8426.02s]  I think you might have to lead the way.
[8427.05s -> 8429.21s]  Okay, there's a difficulty low.
[8429.21s -> 8431.05s]  Let's do a higher difficulty one.
[8431.05s -> 8431.93s]  There's only one.
[8431.93s -> 8433.29s]  There's only two crimes here.
[8433.29s -> 8434.17s]  Difficulty normal.
[8434.89s -> 8435.69s]  Faction mob.
[8436.57s -> 8438.65s]  Yeah, I like awesome.
[8438.65s -> 8441.61s]  And then there's another low difficulty kidnapping and process.
[8444.12s -> 8446.04s]  Okay, that's 473 meters.
[8446.04s -> 8448.12s]  Maybe we should take our...
[8448.12s -> 8448.76s]  Is that that way?
[8449.64s -> 8466.49s]  All right.
[8466.49s -> 8474.25s]  Okay, never mind.
[8474.25s -> 8477.05s]  This was a very easy way to traverse long distances.
[8477.77s -> 8480.18s]  There's a shootout happening downstairs.
[8482.54s -> 8483.98s]  I think we should cover it.
[8483.98s -> 8484.48s]  Coming.
[8485.10s -> 8493.18s]  All right, so where's it at?
[8493.18s -> 8493.68s]  Right here?
[8494.30s -> 8494.94s]  Underneath us?
[8495.58s -> 8496.38s]  Yeah, it's down here.
[8496.38s -> 8498.30s]  I'm going to engage in an aerial attack.
[8498.30s -> 8498.86s]  Let's go for it.
[8500.42s -> 8501.06s]  Wait, what?
[8501.06s -> 8502.10s]  Oh, these are cops.
[8503.27s -> 8503.91s]  What?
[8503.91s -> 8505.90s]  I'm beating up cops.
[8505.90s -> 8506.54s]  I don't know why.
[8506.54s -> 8506.94s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[8506.94s -> 8507.50s]  What happened?
[8507.50s -> 8509.26s]  Wait, this is not the robbery.
[8509.26s -> 8509.98s]  This is a robbery?
[8512.14s -> 8513.34s]  Why are we beating up cops?
[8513.34s -> 8514.06s]  I don't know.
[8514.06s -> 8515.18s]  You came down here.
[8516.22s -> 8517.10s]  What's the mission?
[8517.10s -> 8518.38s]  They're so strong.
[8519.10s -> 8519.50s]  Hold on.
[8520.70s -> 8521.74s]  They have stuff over here.
[8524.38s -> 8525.42s]  I'm shooting the wrong thing.
[8526.70s -> 8536.04s]  Dude, I have ice moves.
[8536.68s -> 8545.64s]  Why are we doing this?
[8545.64s -> 8546.12s]  I don't know.
[8546.84s -> 8548.10s]  Just go with it, I guess.
[8555.11s -> 8557.43s]  It's the next street over, Hassan.
[8558.07s -> 8560.54s]  Oh, God.
[8566.31s -> 8567.27s]  Oh, you killed him.
[8568.23s -> 8570.81s]  All right, it's the next street over.
[8571.45s -> 8572.97s]  I think we helped the cops out.
[8572.97s -> 8574.97s]  I mean, I think we helped the crimers out.
[8574.97s -> 8576.89s]  I think that's what may have just happened.
[8576.89s -> 8577.53s]  It's possible.
[8578.95s -> 8581.19s]  All right, this one is right over here.
[8587.19s -> 8590.39s]  Sorry, but when I go to an address,
[8590.39s -> 8591.83s]  asses need to be whooped.
[8592.47s -> 8593.75s]  All right, so take a look down here.
[8594.47s -> 8597.83s]  We've got to get spotted.
[8598.63s -> 8604.90s]  Okay, I'm hiding currently behind the mailbox.
[8605.70s -> 8606.68s]  Where are you at?
[8610.57s -> 8612.33s]  Are we doing an aerial attack?
[8612.33s -> 8613.21s]  I'm going to wait for you to go in
[8613.21s -> 8613.93s]  and then I'll go into.
[8613.93s -> 8615.53s]  And it's, by the way, silent takedowns
[8616.58s -> 8617.70s]  and try to be undetected.
[8618.26s -> 8620.02s]  Be a little hard.
[8623.54s -> 8626.50s]  Okay, you get the mob brawler on the other side
[8627.22s -> 8629.62s]  and I'll get the mob brawler down right underneath me.
[8630.50s -> 8632.90s]  That way, we'll be able to eliminate both of those.
[8632.90s -> 8634.66s]  Wait, there's another mob brawler over here.
[8635.38s -> 8636.90s]  I'm thinking you jump in and I, yeah.
[8636.90s -> 8638.18s]  Well, because there's only four of them.
[8638.18s -> 8641.06s]  So we're not going to be able to do it silently, I'm saying.
[8641.06s -> 8643.22s]  Unless you also do an aerial attack.
[8643.22s -> 8644.18s]  All right, I feel what you mean.
[8644.18s -> 8645.22s]  Coming up there.
[8645.22s -> 8647.78s]  All right, so I'm going to do an aerial attack silent kill.
[8648.98s -> 8649.62s]  Can I get up here?
[8650.89s -> 8651.45s]  They can't see me.
[8651.45s -> 8652.57s]  All right, see the one I'm right above?
[8653.80s -> 8656.60s]  Okay, that's the one I was going to do, but hold on.
[8656.60s -> 8658.84s]  There's one right next to that one.
[8658.84s -> 8661.48s]  I'm trying to get to, I'm trying to get to that right now.
[8662.20s -> 8664.36s]  Trying to get to a better position, a better perch,
[8664.36s -> 8666.20s]  so I can do an aerial attack on the other one.
[8666.92s -> 8669.40s]  Just drove by, something just flew by the screen.
[8669.40s -> 8671.00s]  Okay, I got a silent takedown.
[8671.00s -> 8673.08s]  All right, three, two, one, go.
[8678.01s -> 8679.37s]  Good, all right.
[8680.25s -> 8681.77s]  Watch out, let's wrap around this way.
[8682.49s -> 8683.94s]  Wait, I'm going to get this guy now.
[8684.50s -> 8686.39s]  Oh wait, he's not.
[8686.39s -> 8688.95s]  Dude, there is a car just driving by.
[8689.75s -> 8690.87s]  I swear to God, that's a car.
[8690.87s -> 8691.43s]  Slow that down.
[8694.79s -> 8695.99s]  There's cops right there,
[8695.99s -> 8697.51s]  and they're not even doing anything about it.
[8697.51s -> 8698.23s]  That's crazy.
[8701.11s -> 8701.99s]  All right, there are three.
[8704.10s -> 8705.70s]  All right, they've been beating the shit out of this person
[8705.70s -> 8706.82s]  for like five straight minutes.
[8706.82s -> 8708.34s]  We need to like act.
[8708.34s -> 8710.39s]  Okay, I'm going to get this other back.
[8710.39s -> 8710.87s]  Oh, shit.
[8715.40s -> 8715.88s]  Oops.
[8715.88s -> 8716.20s]  Uh-oh.
[8717.94s -> 8720.02s]  Defeat enemies undetected is done.
[8720.02s -> 8720.66s]  Not quite.
[8720.66s -> 8721.70s]  I haven't been detected yet.
[8722.34s -> 8727.94s]  Just keep them distracted.
[8727.94s -> 8728.34s]  We'll get it.
[8731.16s -> 8734.79s]  It doesn't count.
[8739.40s -> 8739.80s]  Nice.
[8741.02s -> 8741.66s]  There's one more.
[8742.30s -> 8743.37s]  All right, we got it.
[8743.37s -> 8744.57s]  Crime solved.
[8744.57s -> 8745.13s]  We got it.
[8745.13s -> 8746.33s]  Let's make a check on this person.
[8746.33s -> 8746.97s]  Make sure they're okay.
[8747.53s -> 8748.33s]  Are you all right, sir?
[8749.05s -> 8750.17s]  Thanks, Ero.
[8750.17s -> 8752.97s]  Might be a good idea to head home.
[8752.97s -> 8754.01s]  Yeah, get out of here.
[8755.13s -> 8756.65s]  I'm shooting it in his vicinity,
[8756.65s -> 8758.33s]  so he's like afraid, you know what I mean?
[8759.42s -> 8761.34s]  Wait, yeah, give him a swift kick in the ass.
[8761.98s -> 8763.18s]  That's right.
[8763.18s -> 8764.06s]  Get out of here.
[8764.86s -> 8766.97s]  Teach you something about
[8767.93s -> 8773.24s]  trying to meddle in criminal affairs.
[8774.52s -> 8775.16s]  All right, I'm ready.
[8777.72s -> 8779.00s]  Okay, we solved that crime.
[8779.00s -> 8779.96s]  That was pretty easy.
[8779.96s -> 8780.76s]  I mean, God damn.
[8781.00s -> 8781.88s]  That was pretty soft crime.
[8782.92s -> 8785.16s]  Yeah, felt pretty good.
[8786.97s -> 8789.93s]  So there's one, 212.
[8790.57s -> 8791.61s]  Let's do this hard one.
[8791.61s -> 8792.89s]  This one's leaving 263.
[8792.89s -> 8794.41s]  How do you, where is it?
[8794.41s -> 8795.61s]  So I don't know what it is on yours,
[8795.61s -> 8797.29s]  but okay, on the bottom left of your screen,
[8797.93s -> 8800.17s]  whatever the rightmost ability is,
[8800.17s -> 8802.01s]  is to see what's around you,
[8802.01s -> 8802.89s]  like the AR mode.
[8806.12s -> 8807.56s]  No, it's not.
[8810.76s -> 8812.76s]  If you add, so for me, it's down on the D-pad.
[8812.76s -> 8814.60s]  It's on the lower left of your abilities.
[8814.60s -> 8816.76s]  We heal and call the bike and emote.
[8817.48s -> 8818.52s]  On the map, you mean?
[8819.16s -> 8821.00s]  Oh, no, just like the lower left of your screen,
[8821.00s -> 8822.04s]  like whatever that button is,
[8822.04s -> 8823.56s]  all the way to the right above your health bar.
[8824.52s -> 8827.40s]  Oh, I see it 160 meters away.
[8827.40s -> 8828.52s]  Purple, is that the one?
[8828.52s -> 8834.98s]  Yep.
[8834.98s -> 8836.81s]  Oh, well, is it 100?
[8839.26s -> 8840.22s]  Where is it?
[8840.22s -> 8841.34s]  It's this, I think.
[8841.34s -> 8842.78s]  I think I just way pointed it.
[8842.78s -> 8843.42s]  Hold on.
[8843.42s -> 8844.38s]  It's whatever the one is red.
[8844.38s -> 8845.34s]  It's a red one.
[8845.34s -> 8847.42s]  Oh, it's a red one, not a purple one.
[8847.42s -> 8850.22s]  Okay, I did the wrong thing.
[8850.22s -> 8851.34s]  Wonder what the purple one even means.
[8852.14s -> 8854.30s]  Red one is 256 meters away.
[8854.54s -> 8855.74s]  Does that mean it's hard?
[8855.74s -> 8857.18s]  I think that's a difficult one.
[8858.94s -> 8860.46s]  Wait, let me look at it real quick
[8860.46s -> 8862.22s]  and then try to pinpoint it on the map.
[8863.61s -> 8864.09s]  Oh, yeah.
[8865.48s -> 8867.00s]  That is his difficulty very low.
[8867.72s -> 8868.28s]  Very low.
[8869.32s -> 8873.51s]  Yeah, let's go to the purple one.
[8873.51s -> 8874.39s]  I know what it means.
[8874.39s -> 8875.59s]  We'll do the purple one.
[8875.59s -> 8877.03s]  I don't know what that means, though.
[8877.75s -> 8882.34s]  But again, thank you, Warner Brothers,
[8882.34s -> 8884.10s]  again, for sponsoring this segment of the stream.
[8885.30s -> 8885.86s]  It's out now.
[8886.74s -> 8888.18s]  Both of our panels down below
[8888.18s -> 8889.86s]  should have a image of the link.
[8890.82s -> 8893.14s]  The game is currently on PlayStation 5,
[8893.78s -> 8897.30s]  Xbox Series S, Series X, PC.
[8897.30s -> 8897.94s]  It's out now.
[8897.94s -> 8898.82s]  It came out yesterday.
[8899.62s -> 8900.50s]  Wait, it's down here?
[8901.70s -> 8904.28s]  There is co-op, as you can see.
[8904.28s -> 8905.98s]  Oh, my God.
[8908.60s -> 8909.40s]  Are these criminals
[8909.40s -> 8910.60s]  or are they just trying to get in their car?
[8912.07s -> 8912.47s]  I don't know.
[8912.47s -> 8913.51s]  But you're having a hard time
[8913.51s -> 8914.95s]  whipping that ass, I see.
[8916.86s -> 8917.42s]  I did all right.
[8917.42s -> 8919.18s]  They were going to break into a car, I think.
[8920.74s -> 8922.98s]  Good thing we were here to solve that crime.
[8923.62s -> 8925.16s]  I feel like that was kind of overkill.
[8927.27s -> 8929.43s]  It's like, oh, they're breaking into a car
[8929.43s -> 8930.95s]  and all of a sudden it's like you got us two here
[8930.95s -> 8932.31s]  with like our superpowers.
[8933.11s -> 8934.87s]  Like just throwing ice at people and shit.
[8935.67s -> 8938.07s]  I don't think that was the purple one.
[8938.07s -> 8938.39s]  Oh, no.
[8938.39s -> 8939.03s]  Yeah, it wasn't.
[8939.03s -> 8940.07s]  I was going to say that was not...
[8940.71s -> 8942.55s]  There's one over here.
[8942.55s -> 8943.19s]  There's one over here.
[8943.19s -> 8944.47s]  I thought it was.
[8948.36s -> 8948.68s]  Right here.
[8952.20s -> 8952.76s]  Oh, wait.
[8952.76s -> 8953.24s]  It's not.
[8953.96s -> 8954.76s]  I'm still going.
[8957.56s -> 8958.92s]  We can do this really quickly.
[8959.80s -> 8960.92s]  I'll go for a stealth kill
[8960.92s -> 8962.76s]  and you go for a silent take down from above.
[8962.76s -> 8975.78s]  You just like Mario jumped on his head.
[8979.78s -> 8980.34s]  That's right.
[8982.14s -> 8983.74s]  That was not a purple one, was it?
[8983.74s -> 8984.70s]  That was the purple one.
[8984.70s -> 8986.62s]  No, no, I think there's...
[8986.62s -> 8989.59s]  No, there's another purple marker on mine.
[8993.50s -> 8994.14s]  Difficulty low.
[8994.14s -> 8994.94s]  Let's do a hard one.
[8995.99s -> 8996.55s]  I don't...
[8996.55s -> 8997.59s]  There isn't any...
[8997.59s -> 8998.55s]  Like it's not...
[8998.55s -> 8999.67s]  I have no hard ones.
[8999.67s -> 9000.15s]  Oh, I think...
[9000.15s -> 9000.95s]  Yeah, because we're low.
[9001.67s -> 9003.19s]  Let's do the one that is bright.
[9003.83s -> 9005.19s]  Let's just do this one then.
[9005.19s -> 9006.79s]  This is called the Freaks.
[9006.79s -> 9007.59s]  I have it marked.
[9008.31s -> 9009.35s]  We can call it for this if you want.
[9010.07s -> 9010.31s]  Okay.
[9011.59s -> 9012.15s]  Lead the way.
[9013.03s -> 9014.15s]  A lot of fun playing with you, dude.
[9019.74s -> 9020.86s]  Absolutely.
[9020.86s -> 9021.66s]  Anytime.
[9028.74s -> 9029.06s]  All right.
[9029.06s -> 9032.34s]  So I don't know what exactly this is, but we'll find out.
[9032.34s -> 9033.62s]  We're about to find out.
[9041.64s -> 9042.76s]  I did say it back.
[9042.76s -> 9043.64s]  Why is Chad saying it?
[9043.64s -> 9044.60s]  Wait, did you not hear me?
[9045.16s -> 9045.64s]  No, I did.
[9045.64s -> 9045.88s]  Yeah.
[9046.60s -> 9048.12s]  I said, absolutely.
[9048.12s -> 9049.00s]  Anytime.
[9049.00s -> 9049.48s]  I heard it.
[9050.79s -> 9052.23s]  I had a lot of fun, too.
[9054.71s -> 9055.11s]  All right.
[9055.11s -> 9056.95s]  So there's a lot of...
[9056.95s -> 9057.99s]  That's why I was begging him.
[9059.67s -> 9060.39s]  Literally.
[9060.39s -> 9060.79s]  Whoa.
[9060.79s -> 9061.43s]  Two stars.
[9061.43s -> 9063.51s]  I mean, you can tell that story if you want.
[9064.15s -> 9067.77s]  I was like, no, I don't want to play with you.
[9067.77s -> 9068.41s]  You suck.
[9068.41s -> 9069.37s]  You're bad at the game.
[9070.90s -> 9072.26s]  And I was like, please, Yerma.
[9073.14s -> 9073.78s]  I need you.
[9074.34s -> 9075.62s]  Aerial attack time.
[9076.50s -> 9078.98s]  Aerial attack doesn't kill people, which is weird.
[9079.94s -> 9082.42s]  Wait, why are cops shooting at me now?
[9085.35s -> 9085.91s]  All right.
[9085.91s -> 9086.31s]  Let's get them.
[9088.14s -> 9088.86s]  Is that...
[9088.86s -> 9091.50s]  Did cops shoot you in your game, too?
[9091.50s -> 9093.66s]  They did, but I ran somebody over with my car.
[9093.66s -> 9095.34s]  So, I mean, it made sense.
[9096.38s -> 9098.94s]  Like, I was like running people over.
[9098.94s -> 9100.78s]  I was attacking people.
[9100.78s -> 9103.58s]  Now I'm hitting these cops and they're not actually doing anything.
[9104.70s -> 9107.26s]  I was driving into people and shooting at them.
[9107.26s -> 9109.50s]  It was a disaster the first 10 minutes of the stream.
[9110.30s -> 9111.34s]  I played it for the first time.
[9117.38s -> 9117.78s]  Damn.
[9120.86s -> 9121.98s]  Whoa, chill, bro.
[9121.98s -> 9123.18s]  Cops are shooting me, too.
[9123.98s -> 9128.62s]  Are they still mad at you?
[9129.58s -> 9129.82s]  No.
[9130.54s -> 9132.70s]  I think they were accidentally shooting me.
[9133.90s -> 9134.62s]  Hey, oh, no.
[9135.66s -> 9137.46s]  Wait, they're running away.
[9137.46s -> 9138.10s]  Run away.
[9138.10s -> 9139.06s]  Get out of here.
[9139.06s -> 9139.56s]  Get.
[9142.07s -> 9143.43s]  That's how I clear an area, though.
[9143.43s -> 9144.95s]  That's just like my signature move.
[9148.49s -> 9149.05s]  Okay.
[9149.05s -> 9149.45s]  All right.
[9149.45s -> 9150.73s]  You want to do one more or are you good?
[9151.29s -> 9152.09s]  It's up to you.
[9152.09s -> 9153.77s]  I'll do one more if you want to do one more.
[9153.77s -> 9154.97s]  You need for the guns down.
[9155.94s -> 9157.62s]  I will never put my guns down.
[9158.18s -> 9159.06s]  America, damn it.
[9159.06s -> 9159.78s]  It's Gotham.
[9160.68s -> 9163.24s]  I mean, I don't know what this one is, but we can go to it.
[9163.24s -> 9163.74s]  Let's do it.
[9164.36s -> 9166.58s]  Somebody just called you out.
[9168.33s -> 9169.13s]  Yeah, she did.
[9175.30s -> 9175.80s]  What?
[9176.52s -> 9187.26s]  So this one looks like the previous one that we just did.
[9187.26s -> 9189.42s]  I think maybe we didn't get rid of them all.
[9191.79s -> 9193.47s]  No, it cleared it for me.
[9194.19s -> 9208.99s]  Oh, she's an AK.
[9208.99s -> 9209.95s]  Let's go.
[9209.95s -> 9211.79s]  This one's a little bit more challenging.
[9211.79s -> 9212.35s]  Just kidding.
[9213.15s -> 9213.63s]  Whoa.
[9213.63s -> 9214.03s]  Watch out.
[9214.03s -> 9214.91s]  She's aiming for you.
[9220.60s -> 9221.24s]  Yeah.
[9221.24s -> 9223.00s]  Look, team attack, team attack, team attack.
[9223.00s -> 9223.48s]  Come over here.
[9224.28s -> 9224.84s]  Team attack.
[9225.98s -> 9230.78s]  Oh, oh, that was sick.
[9230.78s -> 9231.98s]  Yeah, that was so again.
[9233.53s -> 9235.53s]  Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.
[9236.92s -> 9237.42s]  Damn it.
[9239.47s -> 9240.19s]  That's pretty cool.
[9245.55s -> 9245.95s]  All right.
[9245.95s -> 9246.59s]  How are you doing?
[9246.59s -> 9247.55s]  Is that you good?
[9248.35s -> 9248.91s]  I'm good.
[9248.91s -> 9249.41s]  Yeah.
[9250.38s -> 9251.02s]  All right, German.
[9251.02s -> 9251.66s]  Thank you so much.
[9254.06s -> 9259.71s]  Thank you to Warner Brothers for allowing us to play this wonderful game.
[9260.27s -> 9266.83s]  Gotham Knights, which is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox XS, and the PC.
[9267.79s -> 9268.19s]  That's right.
[9268.19s -> 9272.19s]  Get it by clicking on our respective tabs underneath.
[9274.48s -> 9274.80s]  Great.
[9275.95s -> 9276.27s]  All right.
[9276.27s -> 9276.67s]  Bye.
[9276.67s -> 9276.83s]  Yeah.
[9276.83s -> 9277.63s]  Thanks for playing, dude.
[9277.63s -> 9278.83s]  Well, I'll talk to you soon.
[9282.44s -> 9283.80s]  Cool.
[9283.80s -> 9284.12s]  Okay.
[9285.85s -> 9287.61s]  So that was Gotham Knights.
[9287.61s -> 9289.04s]  Oh, I got kicked.
[9289.04s -> 9290.92s]  That was Gotham Knights.
[9291.56s -> 9294.81s]  That's going to conclude the sponsor segment
[9294.81s -> 9297.21s]  and that's going to conclude the sponsored streams for Gotham Knights.
[9298.81s -> 9300.73s]  Huge, huge thank you to Warner Brothers.
[9303.16s -> 9304.36s]  Like I said before,
[9304.36s -> 9309.72s]  WB has been an unbelievable supporter of the stream, so I'm happy to play.
[9311.44s -> 9312.24s]  Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[9312.24s -> 9313.28s]  Hope it was fun to watch.
[9314.00s -> 9315.84s]  The game is available right now.
[9315.84s -> 9317.13s]  You like what you saw?
[9317.13s -> 9318.01s]  It's available right now.
[9320.78s -> 9327.55s]  With that, I'm going to end the stream.
[9327.55s -> 9328.99s]  Thanks to Hassan Tupac for playing.
[9328.99s -> 9331.79s]  I mean, he was just, you know, check out the co-op.
[9331.79s -> 9333.39s]  Why not?
[9333.39s -> 9335.79s]  And I will see you guys in a few days.
[9335.79s -> 9337.95s]  See you on the 25th.
[9337.95s -> 9342.14s]  25th at probably around 4 Pacific, I want to say.
[9342.14s -> 9345.36s]  I'm going to start doing Halloween stuff.
[9345.36s -> 9347.84s]  I might play, I don't know, I'll figure it out.
[9347.84s -> 9354.96s]  I'll be in pre-stream on the 25th.
[9354.96s -> 9357.76s]  Maybe a little bit early, maybe like 3 Pacific.
[9357.76s -> 9362.48s]  But yeah, thanks for watching.
[9362.48s -> 9363.96s]  See you guys later.
[9364.68s -> 9374.30s]  We'll just kind of play it out here.
[9374.30s -> 9374.86s]  Very cool.
[9375.50s -> 9378.84s]  Can we get one scorn?
[9378.84s -> 9383.42s]  You want one scorn?
[9383.42s -> 9385.87s]  You guys have been good.
[9385.87s -> 9386.75s]  You guys have been good.
[9386.75s -> 9403.21s]  I'll give you a scorn.
[9403.21s -> 9404.25s]  No, we haven't.
[9404.25s -> 9405.13s]  We've been good.
[9405.13s -> 9410.75s]  Probably you guys have not been good.
[9410.75s -> 9412.99s]  You guys have been, you behaved pretty well today.
[9412.99s -> 9420.03s]  Yeah, I'll give you, okay, here it comes.
[9420.03s -> 9421.08s]  Prepare yourself.
[9421.08s -> 9427.77s]  It's on its way right now in three, two, scorn.
[9427.77s -> 9435.44s]  That's so funny that he scorned.
[9435.44s -> 9443.10s]  Yeah, good night guys.
[9443.10s -> 9443.82s]  See you soon.
[9443.82s -> 9445.10s]  Take care of yourselves.
[9445.10s -> 9445.90s]  Goodbye.
[9445.90s -> 9448.94s]  See you on the 25th around 3 Pacific.
[9448.94s -> 9449.90s]  We'll figure it out.
[9449.90s -> 9510.30s]  See you soon.
