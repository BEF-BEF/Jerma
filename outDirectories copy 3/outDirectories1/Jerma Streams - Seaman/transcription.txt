[1.91s -> 10.76s]  Hello. Good afternoon. And for some of you, good evening. Good morrow, maybe for a handful of you
[10.76s -> 24.15s]  as well. Yeah, uh, stream was scheduled for tomorrow, but like all things, sometimes you can
[24.15s -> 33.22s]  move stuff around and decided I was gonna stream today. Would you look at that? Nice EU time.
[33.94s -> 42.20s]  Uh, four, let's see, five, six, three, like fifty, three, thirty, three, zero, four, five, six, six, seven, eight,
[42.20s -> 54.62s]  nine, ten, eleven. It's like 1130 EU, right? Nice game name that I didn't name it. All right,
[54.62s -> 62.28s]  daylight savings time too. I hate that. There's nothing worse than sitting on your computer,
[63.16s -> 69.72s]  just getting shit done. And it's you're up a little too late and you know that. And it's
[70.52s -> 76.44s]  1230 AM, one AM. And you're like, I still, it's all right. I still get to one AM. You go up to
[76.44s -> 86.20s]  go to the bathroom. You come back and all of a sudden it's three AM. What, how, what happened?
[87.42s -> 95.16s]  No, this is not fair. This is not fair at all. I gotta, I have to, no, I have work to do. And
[95.16s -> 100.36s]  then you have to force yourself to go to sleep. And that sucks always because you're sitting there
[100.44s -> 105.48s]  lying like toy soldier style in the bed, closing your eyes, squeezing them, going like,
[105.48s -> 112.79s]  fuck daylight savings time. Oh, I'm, I'm well aware, especially for school too.
[113.59s -> 124.84s]  When I was in college, hated it. It was the worst thing ever. You'd be sitting there looking at
[124.84s -> 129.32s]  your phone or something or hanging out on your computer and it would just teleport an hour
[129.32s -> 135.46s]  forward. And it just screws you up for like a week. But regardless, happy daylight savings.
[136.18s -> 149.42s]  Today we're going to play Seaman. Does the microphone work? I don't know because,
[150.22s -> 155.64s]  well, it knows it exists. I loaded the game up and it said, please put, uh, this is Leonard
[155.64s -> 162.44s]  Nimoy, by the way, is the voice of Seaman and the narrator as well. So it did recognize that
[162.44s -> 168.33s]  it was in there. I don't know if it works because I really didn't want to jump into it unless we
[168.33s -> 177.32s]  were all here. And that's five computer subs from Hot Take Alert. Thanks for the five subs,
[177.32s -> 183.90s]  Hot Take. So this is what we're doing today. I don't know how long this is going to be.
[186.17s -> 193.06s]  We'll find out. I'm ready to close the lid and get going. I bought a counterfeit Seaman mic.
[194.49s -> 197.85s]  I don't think that's possible. Is that possible? You can't buy a fake one. Can you?
[198.65s -> 206.78s]  I don't think you can. Let's close the lid. Let me get this over here.
[208.41s -> 215.75s]  Hey, you've seen that familiar face before, haven't you? That is the Dreamcast. All right.
[215.75s -> 223.14s]  Seaman, here we go. So just to give everybody a little intro here as to what the fuck is even
[223.14s -> 230.66s]  going on. This, this is the Dreamcast controller as you see, right? Only difference is this time
[231.38s -> 237.48s]  there's a little thing on it. This thing right here. I have to speak into this to talk to the
[237.48s -> 245.62s]  Seaman. And I owned this game when I was younger, but I was too young to understand what the fuck
[245.62s -> 249.86s]  was going on and how I was supposed to play it in the first place. So I got bored because
[249.86s -> 253.94s]  I think I said like, hello, three or four times and realized it wasn't like a fun,
[253.94s -> 259.62s]  like welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Hold on. You'll witness before you a
[259.62s -> 268.02s]  phenomenon like no other. A man of the sea. Seaman, this legendary creature will be dependent on you
[268.02s -> 277.38s]  for his life's blood. You'll begin right here in Gasset's laboratory. What awaits you within?
[278.58s -> 285.14s]  You have no idea what Seaman is or how it evolves. This is something you must find out for yourself
[285.86s -> 292.58s]  as there's little documentation to help you on your way. My name is Leonard Nimoy and I will be
[292.58s -> 300.98s]  your guide. Well, this is your first day with the Seaman kit. Your first step will involve preparing
[300.98s -> 306.90s]  the tank for Seaman's arrival. Adjust the tank settings to be an adequate temperature with
[306.90s -> 314.42s]  sufficient oxygen. While adjusting, keep in mind that blue is the color of the sea and thus an
[314.42s -> 321.94s]  appropriate color for the care of Seaman. Then take the egg from the storage matrix and place it in the
[321.94s -> 327.30s]  tank. Okay. The water's temperature is key to the hatching of the egg. So we have to hatch an egg
[327.30s -> 332.50s]  first. Once hatched, the nautilus will play a very important role in Seaman's development.
[334.04s -> 341.16s]  Each time you visit this laboratory, I'll be here to offer advice and guidance. If you tire of my
[341.16s -> 345.56s]  voice... By the way, it's kind of hard to pay attention because of the fucking deli slicer over
[345.56s -> 352.36s]  here next to me. Very well. I completely forgot about the deli slicer. As you see, press start.
[356.68s -> 364.55s]  What's he saying? Oh, look at this calm game where you make a creature. That's like all I
[364.55s -> 368.71s]  hear over here and I buried this. This is not even on my desk. The Dreamcast is over here,
[368.71s -> 378.22s]  down on the ground. Does it give a turn of garbage disposal on with a fork in it? That's what it
[378.22s -> 387.29s]  sounds like when you play with the Dreamcast. Don't be careful, by the way. That's dangerous.
[387.29s -> 394.63s]  Don't even use your garbage disposal. It's fucking scary. Think of how many horror movies you've
[394.63s -> 402.23s]  seen where the guy reaches in and... Don't ever have a garbage disposal. Just clean your plate
[402.23s -> 414.38s]  in the trash. All right. So this is Seaman. We have our hand here. I think we have to get the
[414.38s -> 428.81s]  temperature and the temperature has to be raised. Turn the lights on. Okay, here we go. So left
[428.81s -> 438.79s]  trigger. Here's the egg. Food pellets. We have to feed it. Use voice. There's nothing here to use my
[438.79s -> 447.70s]  voice yet. Hello? No, there's no animal. This is the thing that they tell you not to do at every pet
[447.70s -> 459.03s]  store. All right, let's put the egg. I need lights. The nautilus, right? Use the nautilus.
[459.83s -> 468.65s]  There's a camera. This is the one problem with not having any manual to know. Wait a minute,
[468.65s -> 486.73s]  I do have the manual. Got it. Welcome to Dr. Gassa's live laboratory. Thank you for purchasing
[486.73s -> 492.01s]  the Seaman kit. Please note this software is designed only for use with the Dreamcast
[492.01s -> 496.01s]  console. Do not put this in a PlayStation. Why would you do that? This package contains
[496.01s -> 504.47s]  a Seaman habitat and one Seaman egg. Thank God I have this. Seriously. To begin with, let's learn
[504.47s -> 510.07s]  a bit about Seaman, shall we? Historical references to Seaman first appeared in the spoken folklore of
[510.07s -> 514.63s]  ancient Egypt, passed down from generation to generation. Until recently, it was assumed that
[514.63s -> 518.71s]  the Seaman creature did not actually exist, similar to many other mythical creatures of ancient
[518.71s -> 527.05s]  Egypt. However, in 1997, the discovery of a live Seaman in the Egyptian city of old Alexandria
[527.05s -> 535.67s]  disproved this assumption, and Seaman can't be known as the world over. While the originally
[535.67s -> 542.90s]  discovered Seaman specimen died shortly after being captured, its remains were quickly rushed
[542.90s -> 549.70s]  to the foremost biologist research institute in France, where a number of eggs were discovered
[549.70s -> 556.52s]  inside its body. We at Vivarium were then able to assist in the endeavor by covering the research
[556.52s -> 561.16s]  and development costs in return for the sole distribution of rights that have enabled us to
[561.48s -> 568.42s]  this product to you. There he is.
[583.11s -> 583.91s]  No, that's not what it says.
[589.51s -> 592.07s]  Welcome. Okay. A memory card is required.
[601.10s -> 617.91s]  Should I read this whole thing? I mean, look, this was like a fucking hundred bucks.
[617.91s -> 625.27s]  I'm reading the whole thing. It was 80 fucking bucks for this microphone, and the disc was like
[625.83s -> 630.46s]  28. I'm reading it. I'm milking this stream for all it's got.
[641.98s -> 647.58s]  Dr. Jean-Paul Gasset. Dr. Gasset was a member of a special team of French biologists
[648.14s -> 653.34s]  dispatched to Egypt by the French government in the 1930s when he discovered references to a
[653.34s -> 659.82s]  creature dubbed the Omnipotent Messenger of the Gods. Among ruins of the third dynasty,
[659.82s -> 663.34s]  he became determined to pursue this line of research and unravel the mystery.
[665.82s -> 671.26s]  In March of 1932 in the city of Alexandria, Dr. Gasset happened to meet up with a local resident
[671.26s -> 676.62s]  who had caught a seaman while fishing. Dr. Gasset obtained a sample of some of the eggs,
[676.62s -> 681.66s]  which he carried back with him to France. When Dr. Gasset returned, he immediately attempted to
[681.66s -> 689.34s]  raise the seaman eggs in his Parisian laboratory, but unfortunately in the midst of his experiment,
[690.14s -> 697.10s]  the seaman died. Dead. The seaman died. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Gasset published a detailed thesis
[697.10s -> 703.08s]  of his work. He didn't do very well. He brought, you put him in a backpack and they died.
[703.88s -> 711.40s]  You're gonna write about it now? Oh, I'm not like, oh let me, hold on a minute there. There we go.
[712.73s -> 717.67s]  Uh, let's see. However, after leading academics of the day,
[718.87s -> 724.07s]  dismissed the young scholar's work as a publicity stunt and without the proper evidence,
[724.07s -> 729.19s]  e.g. a living specimen. To support his theories, his work was shunned and no one believed him.
[729.75s -> 738.46s]  Dr. Gasset's hypothesis suggested that seaman was perhaps responsible for transferring knowledge
[739.02s -> 746.28s]  that proliferated during the third dynasty across oceans to other lands. This theory
[746.28s -> 752.92s]  eventually became the basis for it. Anthro bioarchaeology, a highly valued field of study
[752.92s -> 758.73s]  today. Soon after the publication of his thesis, Dr. Gasset was dismissed from his post. He then
[758.73s -> 763.37s]  disappeared for quite some time. Recently a dire, I don't know, I don't need to read the rest. He
[763.37s -> 768.01s]  like genetically put his fucking brain in the fish and that's who you talk to. I figured it out.
[768.01s -> 777.06s]  He like, he is the fish. Guaranteed. Continued research to unravel the details of seaman's
[777.06s -> 782.42s]  evolution. For further details kindly refer to the following website. I don't think this website
[782.42s -> 791.67s]  still works. It's www.meetseaman.com. I would highly recommend you don't do that website considering
[791.67s -> 797.29s]  the potential pornographic consequences because it definitely doesn't exist anymore.
[798.09s -> 801.69s]  All right, here we go. Before starting a game, this is the first things first reality check.
[802.41s -> 808.94s]  Seaman is a one player game. So once you begin raising seaman, you're expected to assume complete
[808.94s -> 812.78s]  responsibility for the care and upbringing of a living breathing creature. So before you begin
[812.78s -> 817.66s]  with the initial setup procedure, you are strongly recommended to double check with yourself that you
[817.66s -> 828.42s]  are mentally prepared to assume this important responsibility. It's not like buying it. It's not
[828.42s -> 835.69s]  like owning a dog or cat. This is the conversation. Okay, this is the mom. This booklet is the mom and
[835.69s -> 841.85s]  I'm the kid and I just said I wanted a kitty and it's given me the whole, okay, well remember
[842.57s -> 845.93s]  you've got to take care of this cat. Are you, are you ready for that? You have to clean its
[845.93s -> 851.96s]  litter box and it's like, yeah, yeah, I will. God. The first step you must take in preparation
[851.96s -> 856.20s]  is set up with the required equipment. At this time, should you experience any tension related
[856.20s -> 862.12s]  symptoms such as heart palpitations, perspiration, etc. Resulting from the sheer weight of the
[862.12s -> 870.06s]  responsibility for rearing a seaman. You may wish to loosen up a bit by stretching or taking a bit
[870.06s -> 875.88s]  of exercise. Once you are sufficiently relaxed, you are ready to begin. Do not turn the power of
[875.88s -> 894.52s]  the dream cast on yet. Says it right there. Do you see? Do not turn the power of the dream cast on.
[896.52s -> 903.42s]  Whatever, we already did it. It's too late. Okay, got the memory card in, got the micro. As seaman
[903.42s -> 911.66s]  matures, there will come a time when it will begin to converse with you. A microphone has been
[911.66s -> 917.34s]  included in this package for the express purposes of speaking to your seaman. Whenever you wish to
[917.34s -> 920.86s]  play with your seaman, always be sure to insert the microphone into expansion socket two.
[922.22s -> 926.70s]  No, the VMU must be inserted into expansion socket one. The seaman software will not run
[926.70s -> 931.50s]  if these two devices are not correctly inserted in the right slots. All right, so how do I play?
[931.50s -> 941.83s]  Got it. Creating a seaman habitat. Put that down for now. Oh, don't break. Just buy the domain
[941.83s -> 955.24s]  already. Just buy, wait, buy the seaman domain? Buy the seaman domain and just have it be a
[955.24s -> 974.39s]  fucking picture of this. How much is that? No, I'm not doing that shit. All right, maybe I'll do it.
[981.43s -> 988.47s]  All right, creating a seaman habitat. Memory card file, got it. Yep, okay, let's figure this out.
[989.11s -> 998.28s]  Here we go. Do you see what that says? That says mental preparation. Mental preparation.
[1006.23s -> 1011.75s]  The most fundamental requirement for successfully raising seaman is daily care and maintenance.
[1014.12s -> 1019.56s]  At the very least, you are kindly requested to attend to various custodial tasks such as providing
[1019.56s -> 1026.04s]  oxygen, water, food, cleaning, etc. on a daily basis, just as with a daily exercise program.
[1026.76s -> 1031.56s]  It is important that you participate each and every day without fail. This concept is a
[1031.56s -> 1037.94s]  prerequisite for being a guardian to seaman. Seaman is a game in which you will experience
[1037.94s -> 1043.46s]  the growth of a living being. You will witness the drama of life over an extended period of time.
[1043.46s -> 1050.17s]  Therefore, you do not expect an experience similar to any other games in which clearly defined
[1050.17s -> 1060.62s]  events happen each time you play. This is like 1998. They figured this out.
[1061.26s -> 1067.27s]  Neopets figured this out in like 2006, don't worry. This is not the type of game in which
[1067.27s -> 1072.71s]  one can spend several hours in one sitting and expect to experience vast amounts of action or
[1072.71s -> 1079.42s]  change. As with life itself, change only occurs over time and even then slowly. Change is only
[1079.42s -> 1087.02s]  evident through the accumulation of experience over time, aka do not stream this game. You wasted
[1087.02s -> 1092.46s]  a hundred dollars, idiot. Enjoy communicating with seaman while you attend to these daily
[1092.46s -> 1097.90s]  maintenance tasks. Tap on the glass of the aquarium to get its attention. Use the microphone to greet
[1097.90s -> 1101.58s]  and converse as well as other methods you will discover in order to express your affection to
[1101.58s -> 1108.94s]  it. This is paramount to ensuring the successful growth and development of your seaman. As seaman
[1108.94s -> 1112.70s]  matures and reaches a certain level of development, recognition will increase and it will begin
[1112.70s -> 1124.14s]  conversing with you. I have to stream this every day. A daily stream. Seaman's development will
[1124.14s -> 1128.86s]  accelerate when in good humor. The only way to ensure seaman is kept in good humor is to take
[1128.86s -> 1135.06s]  adequate care of it daily without fail while constantly providing loving affection. Although
[1135.06s -> 1141.88s]  raising seaman does require a bit of perseverance, it is a bit like writing in a diary. Just set the
[1141.96s -> 1155.96s]  date forward one day. Just cheat. Should I just make my internal clock like 2040? No, I have to
[1155.96s -> 1160.44s]  go every day. I'm gonna have to turn off the console and go and change the clock every day.
[1161.00s -> 1164.28s]  We're gonna we're gonna be like four weeks. Oh this is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[1169.14s -> 1173.54s]  Although raising seaman does require a bit of perseverance, it is a bit like writing in a
[1173.54s -> 1179.54s]  diary. Something you need to persist in doing on a daily basis. By doing so, you will find yourself
[1179.54s -> 1184.02s]  experiencing a grand drama the likes of which have yet been rendered possible by even the most
[1184.02s -> 1193.34s]  realistic of computer or console games. For those of you with time to spare, one highly recommended
[1193.34s -> 1199.10s]  and interesting method for enjoying your time with seaman is to darken the lights into your room and
[1199.10s -> 1207.30s]  simply vegetate while watching your seaman go about daily life. Similar to a typical aquarium,
[1208.02s -> 1215.58s]  what about working or school? This is encouraging you to literally not go to work,
[1216.14s -> 1227.13s]  not go to school, and sit there and vegetate it says all day. Seaman will provide completely
[1227.13s -> 1232.09s]  different and ever-changing scenery for your television set and for as long as seaman lives
[1232.09s -> 1248.07s]  the show will go on. Let's begin. That's so that's weird. Were you expected just to have it on,
[1248.07s -> 1253.66s]  turned on all day? Here we go. Transfer the egg into the tank. All right, I'm ready.
[1254.46s -> 1260.55s]  Here we go. Subsequent, we've got here are the operations. Here we go. Ready? This is if I if I
[1260.55s -> 1266.31s]  didn't have this book, I would be fucked. Thank God the people that I bought this from. It wasn't
[1266.31s -> 1280.92s]  just like a jewel case. This game sounds like shitty SCP. Relax. All right, operation day one.
[1280.92s -> 1287.26s]  I'm ready. Hello. Once again, you are urged to review the setup or procedure. Yeah, I know how
[1287.26s -> 1297.29s]  to do that. Okay, press the open button on your Dreamcast to open the disk door. No, this is how
[1297.29s -> 1303.10s]  to put the disk in. Please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Press the start button on the Dreamcast
[1303.10s -> 1310.15s]  controller to display the raising habitat. In the beginning, this will be an aquarium. The very first
[1310.15s -> 1318.82s]  thing you must do is place the seaman egg into the tank. L trigger to toggle the display over
[1318.82s -> 1324.50s]  the storage matrix. The milky white object located in the top of the storage is the seaman egg.
[1326.50s -> 1336.26s]  Use the analog thumb pad to select the egg. Okay, so I got I've got two here. All right. Yeah,
[1336.26s -> 1341.46s]  I know. I know. I know. I know what it said. I heard it too, but I just swallowed it. Okay.
[1342.02s -> 1378.50s]  I like no, no, no. I just didn't react to it. And that's like, oh, wow. I said that on purpose,
[1378.50s -> 1387.06s]  right? That's like has to be what it was. Nobody would say that unless they said it on purpose.
[1387.06s -> 1400.97s]  Like, absolutely not. God damn it. What a fucking idiot. Anyways, first transfer the egg into the
[1400.97s -> 1421.22s]  tank. Who gives a shit? I'll be fine. So while use the analog thumb pad to select the egg,
[1427.70s -> 1438.49s]  and while pressing and holding X, press and hold the trigger to grab the egg. Okay, I got it. If
[1438.49s -> 1442.17s]  you are successful, you should see the egg displayed on the clipboard in the lower right
[1442.17s -> 1446.97s]  corner of the screen. In this state, press L again to toggle the display over the aquarium.
[1447.61s -> 1455.66s]  Ooh, shit. So you have to hold it the whole time. So we go like this, right trigger, left,
[1455.66s -> 1463.86s]  and now we're over here. Next, let go of X and R to release the egg into the tank. This the clipboard
[1463.86s -> 1468.26s]  will disappear and the egg will be visible in the tank. This process is used when moving items from
[1468.26s -> 1473.22s]  display to display. Whenever you grasp an item, it will appear on the clipboard. If you release
[1473.22s -> 1476.82s]  the item, let go of X and or R before switching to the display in which to release the item,
[1476.82s -> 1491.24s]  the item will return to the original location. So let go. Where is it? Did I just drop it on the
[1491.24s -> 1511.18s]  ground? How do I zoom out? How do I like zoom the camera out? Where's the egg? When continuing
[1511.18s -> 1521.32s]  from, please insert the memory card into... How do I turn the lights on? This is not dead already.
[1521.32s -> 1532.73s]  How do I turn on the lights? Would you like to save and end the session? No, not yet. Okay,
[1532.73s -> 1541.46s]  then it says subsequent operation. All right. When continuing from previously saved file,
[1543.54s -> 1548.66s]  only one seamen habitat is able to be created on a VMU. Therefore file selection, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1548.66s -> 1552.82s]  Whenever the start screen is displayed, there will be a short narration that reports on the
[1552.82s -> 1558.02s]  current status of your seamen's development and provides a brief explanation of what has occurred
[1558.02s -> 1564.74s]  previously, as there are often important hints and tips on how to proceed offered during this
[1564.74s -> 1571.16s]  narration. It is recommended that you listen to it carefully every single day. If the mushrooms
[1571.16s -> 1580.36s]  do not evolve within a few days of their hatching, they will die. How do I turn the lights on?
[1582.33s -> 1586.73s]  Position the hand over the nautilus at the bottom of the tank and press R to patiently tap it.
[1587.37s -> 1592.89s]  The mushroomers will float towards the nautilus and be eaten. Do not be alarmed by this behavior
[1592.89s -> 1596.17s]  and continue on as normal. Once the nautilus has consumed at least four
[1596.17s -> 1600.25s]  mushroomers, it will begin to undergo a transformation, so observe it carefully.
[1601.05s -> 1626.79s]  How do I turn on the lights? How do you turn on the lights? Before turning on the Dreamcast,
[1627.43s -> 1634.22s]  flip the light switch. Controls, yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
[1634.94s -> 1639.66s]  Toggle, once displayed, toggle between each function. Use the D-pad to operate the various
[1639.66s -> 1661.05s]  devices that control the habitat. Okay, so we got heater, air, light. Oh, okay, where's the egg?
[1661.05s -> 1671.56s]  Press down to hide the habitat panel. So what do I need to do for heat? How do I clean the tank?
[1672.36s -> 1693.35s]  How do I give the, how do I give mushrooms to the thing? Tap it, right? Turn on the heat.
[1694.63s -> 1700.71s]  Leonard didn't tell me that. Hold on. Would you like to save and end the session? It didn't tell
[1700.71s -> 1714.47s]  me what heat I needed to put it to. How to interact with a flick seaman. Caring for your seaman.
[1714.47s -> 1727.10s]  I just had to keep reading, okay? Relax. Use the D-pad to operate the devices on the habitat
[1727.10s -> 1731.42s]  operation panel. Because the analog design for this device is old-fashioned,
[1731.42s -> 1734.94s]  you are only able to perform operations such as raising the temperature or increasing the
[1734.94s -> 1740.95s]  oxygen level of the habitat. For the duration, you press the relevant button. Once you've released
[1740.95s -> 1744.31s]  the button, the temperature will begin to decrease and the oxygen to dissipate with the
[1744.31s -> 1760.82s]  passage of time. Maybe I haven't prepared myself mentally for it. I am absolutely prepared mentally
[1760.82s -> 1770.09s]  for it. Okay. Granted, the system used to operate requires far more work than would a fully automated
[1770.09s -> 1774.49s]  digital habitat system, but let us not forget the benefits that this analog style system provides.
[1775.30s -> 1779.54s]  Perhaps such work will be useful in teaching you a concept that is often forgotten in this
[1779.54s -> 1785.14s]  fully automated society we live in. Mainly that the first step towards conveying true affection
[1785.14s -> 1790.10s]  for another is through constant attention and care. Not through Twitter, not through Facebook,
[1790.10s -> 1794.90s]  not through Instagram. Delete them. You don't need them. You don't even have to use them.
[1794.90s -> 1799.46s]  Get rid of your Facebook. Leonard Nimoy told you fucking 20 years ago this was going to happen.
[1800.26s -> 1814.04s]  Don't use it anymore. Go outside. Go outside and at least once a week. Leonard Nimoy warned us about
[1814.04s -> 1819.51s]  this. It is necessary to maintain appropriate levels of temperature, oxygen, etc. in order to
[1819.51s -> 1824.15s]  provide semen with a suitable living environment. Therefore, it is necessary for you to adjust these
[1824.15s -> 1830.39s]  levels as required to display the habitat operation panel on the screen. The functions that are
[1830.39s -> 1833.67s]  available for use at the current stage of your semen development will appear on the panel.
[1834.39s -> 1838.07s]  Press this way or that way to toggle between the available functions and then press
[1838.71s -> 1842.71s]  that way or this way to activate the selected function to hide the habitat updation panel.
[1843.19s -> 1850.10s]  Press okay. Display the habitat operation panel and toggle until the word light appears.
[1850.66s -> 1865.98s]  Press. I thought that was a house. I was like where's the home button? You see that? I was
[1865.98s -> 1877.74s]  like home. It's up. It is recommended that normally you keep the light on at the brightest setting
[1877.74s -> 1882.22s]  in order to observe semen properly. All right. Fucking heater. Display the habitat operation
[1882.22s -> 1887.02s]  panel and toggle until the word heater appears. Press and hold up to turn the heater on and to
[1887.02s -> 1893.16s]  raise the temperature. The heater will only activate and operate while the switch is pressed.
[1893.16s -> 1896.28s]  It will take a few moments to get going and then may continue for a moment after the switch is
[1896.28s -> 1899.88s]  released. Practice your timing and above all take care not to overheat the habitat. Just after the
[1899.88s -> 1905.64s]  habitat is first created, temperature is zero. Unlike modern American heaters, the heating
[1905.64s -> 1910.68s]  units are measured in Celsius, the same scale used by Dr. Cassell. This is going to be bad.
[1910.68s -> 1924.86s]  I can't change that. It's in Celsius. I don't know what that means. I just saw the image in
[1924.86s -> 1938.89s]  the preview. That was fucked up. Okay. To ensure the eggs hatch properly... Are you listening to me?
[1938.89s -> 1952.94s]  Are you listening? To ensure... I don't care. Whatever. I'll never get it right. To ensure the
[1952.94s -> 1960.18s]  eggs hatch properly, the temperature of the habitat should be maintained between 15 and 20 degrees
[1960.90s -> 1966.10s]  everywhere else in the world besides America. After the eggs have hatched, observe semen carefully
[1966.10s -> 1969.94s]  to determine the appropriate temperature setting and then maintain it accordingly.
[1969.94s -> 1985.10s]  So 15 between 15 and 20 degrees. Okay. Oxygen supply. Imagine not doing this. I can't fucking...
[1985.66s -> 1988.78s]  I'm so glad I did this. Remember like...
[1999.88s -> 2005.51s]  Display the habitat operation panel until the word air appears. Press and hold up to supply a stream
[2005.51s -> 2012.04s]  of oxygen into the tank. The oxygen supply will only continue to increase for the duration you
[2012.04s -> 2016.78s]  hold it. Just after the habitat is first created, the level of oxygen is zero. When the oxygen level
[2016.78s -> 2022.86s]  is lower than 50, when it's lower than 50, semen isn't in danger of suffocation. The appropriate
[2022.86s -> 2027.26s]  level depends on the number of living objects in the habitat. However, it is safe to assume
[2027.26s -> 2033.27s]  that this level must stay above 80 whenever possible. All right. Let me like just fucking
[2033.27s -> 2045.93s]  do this first. So we've got... Here's the menu. Heater. 15 degrees, right? Okay. That's 0.05,
[2045.93s -> 2053.61s]  right? Oh, I see. It slowly does it. Okay. This guy's a bit 15 to 20. Camera's not big enough.
[2053.61s -> 2059.98s]  Oh, fuck. All right. I gotta turn on the generator. I gotta let it go, though. I gotta let it go,
[2059.98s -> 2071.98s]  because it takes a minute to stop, right? Put it to 100 to do a soft-boiled egg.
[2074.20s -> 2079.42s]  You are fucked up. That's not nice. Did you think about what you just said before you said it?
[2082.33s -> 2093.03s]  Wow. Is it gonna suffocate? How long does it take to suffocate? Probably would have already
[2093.03s -> 2104.17s]  happened. Okay. Slow down. Slow down. Well, how do I like my... I like my eggs over medium.
[2106.44s -> 2112.84s]  Yeah, I know. Someone's gonna be like, really? Over easy? No. Over medium. I like a soft but
[2113.40s -> 2121.53s]  tangible yolk in the middle. Over easy is disgusting to me. It just is. I'm sorry. It is.
[2127.43s -> 2135.59s]  It's barely even cooked in the middle. All right. 15 to 20. Here we go. All right. So I'm
[2135.59s -> 2141.21s]  gonna keep it in like around like 17 to 18, you know? Like right here should be good.
[2142.25s -> 2154.18s]  Okay. Now we need to do air. What did it say for air? 80? I'm not fucking it up, am I?
[2154.90s -> 2162.82s]  Do you don't drink raw eggs for strength? No. I don't drink raw eggs for strength.
[2163.54s -> 2169.34s]  Clean the water. I don't know how to do that yet. I need to read how to do that.
[2170.63s -> 2184.52s]  Let me at least let him breathe. Are you guys sour, please, into this? Holy shit. We can actually
[2184.52s -> 2203.66s]  see the tank now. It said keep it above 80. Who knew that reading would help, right? I know.
[2204.30s -> 2214.34s]  Can you have too much air? What happens if you have over air? Oh, that's as high as it can go.
[2214.34s -> 2222.02s]  All right. Cleaning. How do I clean? Let's get this to higher. What happens if there's too much?
[2222.02s -> 2229.46s]  No. Oxygen. If there's too much oxygen, it's bad for you, right? Isn't that how that works?
[2229.46s -> 2236.26s]  Would you like to save and end the session? We breathe CO2, right? So if like the O2 wasn't
[2236.26s -> 2242.23s]  there or if it was too much, it would be like helium. It would turn into H2O, which would be
[2242.23s -> 2259.66s]  helium. Now we exhale CO2. Sorry. My mistake, scientists in chat. Okay. Cleaning. You will
[2259.66s -> 2263.82s]  discover that with each passing day, the water in Seaman's Aquarium will become cloudier,
[2263.82s -> 2268.62s]  indicating a worsening in sanitation condition of the habitat. Cleaning the water is simple,
[2268.62s -> 2272.86s]  and all that you must do is increase the oxygen supply. That's it. As you do this,
[2272.86s -> 2279.30s]  you will notice the water become clearer. Keep the water clean. So you just have to put air in it.
[2280.58s -> 2289.59s]  Just make it oxygenate the water to clean it. H2O is water. It's hydrogen and then oxygen.
[2290.39s -> 2296.14s]  That's not water. Hydrogen is its own thing. Oxygen, when you combine them together,
[2296.14s -> 2301.58s]  you get hydrogen and oxygen. Water is water. It just exists. You're talking about like a chemical
[2301.58s -> 2307.54s]  made in a fucking lab. All right. Please don't leave if you think I'm like actually that stupid.
[2308.26s -> 2311.74s]  Some of you guys might just be like, all right, this guy's fucking out of his mind. I'm out of
[2311.74s -> 2318.31s]  here. All right. So I need to know how, what was the thing about the Nautilus again? The Nautilus
[2318.31s -> 2325.90s]  down there. All right. Feeding your Seaman. Press L to switch to the storage matrix. You'll notice
[2325.90s -> 2330.30s]  11 food pellets that are used to feed Seaman once it reaches the Gilman stage of development.
[2331.02s -> 2343.05s]  We're not there yet. How to say goodbye to Seaman. Living in harmony with Seaman.
[2343.78s -> 2351.30s]  Ah, exchanging food with another razor. Advice. Final notes and pointers.
[2352.02s -> 2359.00s]  Okay, hold on. How do I make the egg hatch? Do I have to feed the egg? Do I have to like inject a
[2359.00s -> 2373.64s]  syringe into the egg? What was the thing about the Nautilus like eating mushrooms? So this is,
[2373.64s -> 2383.69s]  okay, we're in day one. So day two. So, okay, let's just take a look. So that's grab. So this
[2383.69s -> 2390.09s]  is to move forward. Okay. This is the zoom. Yeah. But you know what I mean? Like what can I,
[2390.97s -> 2395.78s]  that's just the egg right there. All right. It's multiplying. It's turning into four cells.
[2396.58s -> 2413.14s]  Is this going to eat it? He's going to eat this. Okay. So now it has to be tomorrow.
[2413.78s -> 2422.06s]  When am I going to eat it? No, I can't talk yet. I don't have the ability to speak. It's called
[2422.06s -> 2436.97s]  mitosis, stupid. Doesn't it take actual days for the game to progress? Yeah. So how do I save it?
[2439.26s -> 2444.90s]  Okay. How do I get, how do I change this clock in the Dreamcast? It only takes a few minutes.
[2445.62s -> 2452.95s]  I'm going to have to go, I'm going to have to turn the console off like 30 times this stream.
[2453.67s -> 2468.14s]  I have to go change the date and time until tomorrow. All right. We'll just get away to
[2468.14s -> 2478.28s]  the egg to hatch. Save and quit. Would you like to save and end the session? Okay. You just have to
[2478.28s -> 2482.20s]  wait. But hold on. Do I have to wait? I think I have to wait till tomorrow is when the egg hatches.
[2482.20s -> 2490.54s]  So I can't just leave. What do you mean no cheating? I'm going to cheat the whole day.
[2492.34s -> 2497.14s]  It only takes a few minutes. It hatches. Okay. All right. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Let me
[2497.14s -> 2509.35s]  get to the part of the instructional booklet. If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days
[2509.35s -> 2522.94s]  of their hatching, they will die. Whoa. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What, what,
[2522.94s -> 2532.92s]  what do I do about the balloons? What, how do I do this? We got it. We got life. How do I,
[2532.92s -> 2544.44s]  when do they turn into, uh, sea monkeys? What do you mean it died? It didn't die. It's all right.
[2544.44s -> 2557.22s]  Now do I have them get eaten? It's not dead. These are like the eggs. One of these. Some of
[2557.22s -> 2563.08s]  these are going to survive. Make sure hot water heater. These are the mushrooms. Okay.
[2564.65s -> 2581.08s]  Tap the nautilus. There's too much air in here. I don't need too much air. It said keep it above 80.
[2581.72s -> 2623.85s]  Uh oh. Hello. Oh shit. Look at this. Get him. Should I be doing this? He's going to get one.
[2623.85s -> 2643.74s]  He's going to get one. Is this how do you make a sea man? Now saving. Now saving. Now saving.
[2644.92s -> 2659.78s]  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. He's pissed. What did I do? Whoa. He got one. He actually just got one.
[2659.78s -> 2696.38s]  This is making me uncomfortable. Just open a guide. I think we're good. They aren't dying.
[2696.38s -> 2701.58s]  Don't worry. No, I know. They're going to get like spit out. What's going on up here? How's the air?
[2701.58s -> 2709.93s]  How's the heat? It's okay. Air is okay. Takes a few minutes. We can just chill. It's all good.
[2710.49s -> 2715.70s]  How many does he need to eat? If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days they're hatching,
[2715.70s -> 2720.18s]  they will die. Position the hand over the nautilus. The mushrooms will float towards the nautilus to
[2720.18s -> 2723.22s]  be eaten. Do not be alarmed by this behavior and continue as normal. Once the nautilus has
[2723.22s -> 2729.96s]  consumed four mushroomers, it will begin to undergo our transformation. He's got to eat two more.
[2730.28s -> 2757.98s]  Eat two more of these. Come on, grab one. Come on. What's his problem? Eat it. He already ate three.
[2757.98s -> 2769.13s]  I think he needs to eat four. Does he have a brain? We need more air. We got plenty of air.
[2769.13s -> 2781.18s]  The heat and the air are fine. Come on, grab one. Grab one. Come on. You need one more. Come on.
[2781.18s -> 2803.93s]  He needs to get one more. Come on. Down here. Come on. No. No. Just go get eaten. Did he eat four?
[2803.93s -> 2816.52s]  I thought he only ate three. Don't annoy him. Just let him be. That was weird. All right. So
[2816.52s -> 2824.46s]  there are only four left in the tank. So that means maybe he did already eat four. All right.
[2824.46s -> 2831.45s]  So then he's going to shit out a seed. So should I go on the clock now and make it like two days
[2831.45s -> 2849.51s]  later? He only eats them when the air is lower. I'm not going to believe that bullshit. There's
[2849.51s -> 2863.88s]  too much air. I can't even lower it. So even if that one guy was telling the truth. Are you sure
[2863.88s -> 2869.10s]  you want to continue with this? It's a very disturbing experience. This was a hundred bucks.
[2869.10s -> 2886.09s]  So yes, this was eighty dollars. Eighty. What's going on? I think is he doing something here?
[2897.35s -> 2903.75s]  Just use an emulator. An emulator cannot do the microphone. This is the only way.
[2903.75s -> 2940.30s]  Whoa! What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Why is he like dying? Uh save him. I don't know.
[2940.30s -> 2953.50s]  How do I? Is that I can't save him? And I want the real experience. I don't want the emulator
[2953.50s -> 2958.97s]  experience. I want the real microphone. The real controller. I want to be authentic. So when my
[2958.97s -> 2965.51s]  children come into the world they can use they can do it too. Check the oxygen. Here we're good.
[2970.57s -> 2982.02s]  This is actually pretty disturbing. I don't think I want to tap. He's going through some shit right
[2982.02s -> 3004.12s]  now. This is okay. Do I have to do anything? It looks like he's cooking in a fryer. Like he's in
[3004.12s -> 3011.40s]  a pan. Yeah that's fucked up. Yeah yellow is bad. Red is dangerous. Yeah as long as it's blue it's
[3011.40s -> 3016.17s]  good. It was between 15 and 20 for here and above 80 for this. So we're good.
[3017.13s -> 3036.18s]  Turn off the lights. Is that the problem? I feel like there's something I should be doing here.
[3036.18s -> 3044.89s]  Turn the oxygen off. I can't. You can only turn it up. Why would anyone buy this game? Because
[3044.89s -> 3067.66s]  it was one of the first video games to allow. Would you like to save and end the session?
[3077.18s -> 3094.74s]  Uh communicating. Communicating once seaman has learned a reasonable vocabulary. Try to
[3094.74s -> 3098.50s]  initiate a conversation in the beginning. It is generally acceptable to address seaman with
[3099.22s -> 3105.70s]  hey or seaman. To do so a mature seaman will often respond to phrases such as say something
[3105.70s -> 3111.59s]  or talk to me. If you observe seaman's manner closely you'll have no problems distinguishing
[3111.59s -> 3115.75s]  when seaman is ready to begin conversing. All conversations with seaman must be made
[3115.75s -> 3121.59s]  via the microphone. Be sure to press a for the full duration of your utterance when speaking to
[3121.59s -> 3127.67s]  seaman. Once each utterance is complete be sure to release a. Note that the general progress of
[3127.67s -> 3132.87s]  your conversation with seaman is indicated by the icons that appear on the LCD screen of the VMU.
[3140.81s -> 3159.34s]  Hello. How are you? What is your purpose? What is your purpose?
[3161.50s -> 3177.16s]  Where's the mothership? How do you like your tank? Are you comfortable?
[3186.22s -> 3198.17s]  Hey how are you? They don't they don't how do I teach them? This one wants to talk. This is the
[3198.17s -> 3210.22s]  one that's closest. Look it keeps coming over here. No no I want this one. Back off. Good afternoon.
[3214.79s -> 3233.35s]  Hi hi play door play dough chicken strips crayons crayon
[3233.83s -> 3242.25s]  hoi mac and cheese. What are what are the lives of kids like? School.
[3248.58s -> 3269.27s]  Fortnite. I'm gonna teach him the alphabet. A. B. C. D.
[3273.13s -> 3286.01s]  He's gonna see the avengers progressing here. We'll see end game theater. E. Seaman.
[3286.65s -> 3310.30s]  Waha. U. Seaman. U. Seaman. U. Molo. U. Seaman. Squeena. Squee. Seaman. Seaman. Play door. Seaman.
[3316.31s -> 3323.62s]  How do I feed how do I feed them? Would you like to save and end the session?
[3324.66s -> 3334.90s]  Feeding. Once you'll notice 11 food pellets that are to be used to feed seem once it reaches the
[3334.98s -> 3355.29s]  Gillman stage of development. Are they they're not are they at Gillman? Not yet right? No no no yes
[3355.29s -> 3362.09s]  yes they are at Gillman. No yes. It's speaking Simlish. Yes they are. Yes yes. Oh you guys saying
[3362.09s -> 3367.83s]  no you don't know what the hell are you talking about? Okay to feed once it reaches give it to
[3367.83s -> 3372.23s]  feed. Seaman use the analog thumb pad to select food pellet and then press and hold grab it.
[3373.35s -> 3377.91s]  Press L to toggle to the aquarium tank then release X and R to drop the food into the water.
[3378.97s -> 3383.45s]  Okay the food pellets initially available in the storage matrix will enable you to feed Seaman for
[3383.45s -> 3389.69s]  a short time provided you do not overfeed it. However after that you will need to create an
[3389.69s -> 3397.59s]  alternate method of providing Seaman with food. What? There is no need to panic for Seaman may
[3397.59s -> 3402.07s]  be able to help you to determine a new method for providing food when the time is right.
[3402.79s -> 3406.81s]  So be sure to observe carefully and listen well to what Seaman has to tell you.
[3410.42s -> 3418.62s]  What is it gonna like eat its own shit? I don't understand that. Take the utmost care to prevent
[3418.62s -> 3425.34s]  using up all the food in the storage. You are advised to only feed Seaman when it is hungry.
[3425.90s -> 3429.98s]  Prick up your ears listen carefully to what Seaman says and be sure to carry out its
[3429.98s -> 3455.78s]  instructions in a timely fashion. So hungry? Hungry? Are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah yeah said yeah.
[3457.67s -> 3482.57s]  Hungry? Cool okay. Who gets to eat it? Oh they do they all they all share the cookie. He just
[3482.57s -> 3505.08s]  stole it. He just took it. Hello? I told you not to feed them. Well I wouldn't mean that not to feed
[3505.08s -> 3511.69s]  them. They're not speaking English. How do I know what hungry means? All they're going they're doing
[3511.69s -> 3517.93s]  like reverse speech like death line. Like that I'm hungry. How am I supposed to know what that means?
[3518.65s -> 3528.92s]  Now I was right to feed them. Are you ready to evolve Pikachu?
[3532.92s -> 3537.54s]  Is it chilly in the tank? Yeah I think it's chilly in the tank. Hold on let me see.
[3538.26s -> 3547.88s]  All right yeah it's a little chilly. 17 about we'll make it 18.
[3548.60s -> 3556.28s]  All right let's get the stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff not too hot too hot. All right we're
[3556.28s -> 3561.10s]  good. What's going on over here? These are like the mushrooms. Are these things just gonna die?
[3567.10s -> 3581.40s]  Didn't why are there only three before that are alive? Yes. Yes.
[3584.66s -> 3596.82s]  Yes. How do you teach a kid language? I don't know how this works. I don't have any children.
[3596.82s -> 3608.62s]  How does a kid learn? I have no idea. I have no idea what to do. See if any died. I don't think so.
[3615.34s -> 3627.16s]  No I think maybe maybe two died. What's what's a sim uh greeting? Like like uh
[3628.04s -> 3632.34s]  how do I do this? How do I speak? How what's with it? It's like it's like bravolo mule
[3632.34s -> 3645.10s]  bye right? Sul sul. Clap clap clap. Ratanar fly.
[3645.82s -> 3670.68s]  Waha. Lumpa. Lumpa. Wrap. Laffy. Laffy. Laffy. Fortnight. Forca. Pabra. Pabra. Pabra.
[3672.26s -> 3687.00s]  Yeah. Hooray. Hooray. Fibula. Fibula. Isn't that an organ? Fibula is like here right? Where's the
[3687.00s -> 3711.05s]  fibula? Check the other ones. Hold on. Hello. Hello. See it's reversed. Are you comfortable?
[3712.60s -> 3719.64s]  Comfy? I have one. Are there translations in the handbook? I don't think so. It just tells
[3719.64s -> 3727.67s]  you when they understand what you're saying. Advice. Here we go. Please realize that concepts
[3727.67s -> 3732.31s]  such as goals or scores do not apply to this game. You are free to enjoy semen in whatever manner you
[3732.31s -> 3737.75s]  find appropriate. However if you endeavor to successfully raise and assist in semen's evolution
[3737.75s -> 3745.80s]  there are a few points you must take into consideration. Go to sleep. Sleep.
[3747.56s -> 3754.01s]  Okay. First off is a strong relationship between knowledge acquisition and semen's growth process.
[3755.29s -> 3762.68s]  Just following around. I've got plenty of air right? Just watch this one for a while.
[3763.32s -> 3768.10s]  As semen's caretaker you are encouraged to take the initiative and talk to semen daily to stimulate
[3768.10s -> 3776.66s]  its desire to learn and in turn aid its maturation. Note that without conversation
[3776.66s -> 3781.14s]  semen's growth process will stop. Therefore it's important to speak to semen throughout its growth
[3781.14s -> 3784.90s]  and development even well before it's matured to the stage of being able to converse with you.
[3785.70s -> 3791.14s]  Secondly it's imperative at some point that you transform the habitat aquarium into a terrarium
[3792.76s -> 3801.03s]  for semen as this is crucial to aiding in its evolution. But not to worry semen will assist
[3801.03s -> 3806.50s]  you in achieving this goal when the time is right. Be sure to listen carefully and attentively to
[3806.50s -> 3810.26s]  all that semen tells you. Eventually when an appropriate level of maturity has been reached
[3810.26s -> 3815.64s]  you must help semen become free of the confines of the habitat. How do I transform the habitat
[3815.64s -> 3820.20s]  aquarium into a land-filled terrarium? What environment lies outside the habitat? How do
[3820.20s -> 3829.21s]  I enable semen to gain freedom from its confines? These are all questions you must be longing to
[3829.21s -> 3837.58s]  have answered. However we have opted not to provide these answers in this manual. We feel
[3837.58s -> 3841.42s]  it would be far more rewarding experience if you do experiment using the exact same laboratory
[3841.42s -> 3846.62s]  conditions as Jean-Paul Gusset in the 30s. We have the utmost confidence that you will be successful
[3846.62s -> 3863.24s]  in your semen rearing efforts. So I just keep stimulating their brains and then I'm going to
[3863.24s -> 3880.84s]  turn the clock forward. Hello? Hello? Hello? Okay. Who got attention? Hey, how are you?
[3883.16s -> 3890.44s]  Have you heard any good jokes lately? Oink-a. Oink-a? Oink-a. Oink-a.
[3891.16s -> 3904.97s]  Momma. Read the B-movie script to them. I'm not, I'm not gonna fucking do that. Yeah, what?
[3905.85s -> 3915.77s]  I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna read these children the late six and a half year old meme. At least
[3915.77s -> 3928.17s]  give us something that's more relevant to today. Okay. Sure. I'm gonna fast forward time now.
[3929.85s -> 3933.69s]  Yeah. I will fast forward time now and then I'm gonna come back and see how you're doing.
[3936.92s -> 3947.94s]  Gnome it. How am I gonna do that? I don't have speakers. Sing him a song.
[3948.74s -> 3960.66s]  O Canada, our home and sacred land.
[3962.34s -> 3979.96s]  True patriot side and all thy sons command. With spoken word we see thy shine. The true
[3979.96s -> 3992.12s]  north young and wise. We're, that's all I know. Any words for that? I'm not, I don't, I'm not
[3992.12s -> 4002.02s]  Canadian. Why would I know the Canadian theme song? You know, I'm supposed to know every country's
[4002.02s -> 4011.26s]  theme song? I live in the United States of America. I've been to Canada twice. I'm supposed to know
[4011.26s -> 4025.27s]  the words to their fucking song? Are you serious? Twice is enough. Wow. Can you believe what they
[4025.27s -> 4035.35s]  just said? Cool. Cool. All right. Um, should I fast forward now? One day. I'm gonna save it. I'm
[4035.35s -> 4043.08s]  gonna end and I'm gonna fast forward the clock a day and we'll see how they're doing. Okay. Be good.
[4044.84s -> 4052.74s]  See you soon. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm not gonna fast forward 40 years. They'll be dead. I'm gonna
[4052.74s -> 4060.58s]  go one day. Come back one day until they get to be adults and I can talk. The tank is not gonna be on
[4060.58s -> 4075.18s]  fire. Let's put the heat up to like 19 and then I have to, oh, not too hot, not too hot, not too
[4075.18s -> 4084.71s]  hot. Stop before 20 please. Put the oxygen, get it to like 100. Okay. Dim the light a little bit.
[4086.90s -> 4092.74s]  All right. Now they're good. I should be able to. Would you like to save and end the session?
[4092.74s -> 4099.80s]  Save and end the session. Go into the clock. Make it tomorrow. I'm not cooking the fishes, guys.
[4102.74s -> 4105.14s]  Just, you just wait till I get to fucking have a conversation with all these
[4106.25s -> 4115.08s]  butt heads. The cliff, there's a cliffhanger in the game. The sequel is only in Japanese.
[4116.97s -> 4127.74s]  It's not gonna work. Why not? All right. Here we go. Saving. We're locked in now. I'm gonna
[4127.74s -> 4133.67s]  change the date to tomorrow. Oh, by the way, I wanted to show you this because I, you may now
[4133.67s -> 4139.51s]  turn the power off. Okay. But before we go any further, you guys need to see this. So I also
[4139.51s -> 4145.43s]  made sure they got Space Channel 5, the original Space Channel 5. And I don't, that's like a plan
[4145.43s -> 4154.22s]  to play this. I don't want to open this because look, this is like original shrink wrapped
[4154.22s -> 4163.50s]  packaging. Isn't this like an artifact? I don't want to open this. You know what I mean? I don't
[4163.50s -> 4171.38s]  think I want to break the seal. This might be worth like 50 grand in like a thousand years.
[4172.26s -> 4178.89s]  You know, my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren
[4178.89s -> 4185.69s]  might be able to sell this for like fucking a million dollars. Here's the crazy thing. Okay.
[4185.69s -> 4189.85s]  Imagine like this clip is going to be saved for probably a while. I don't know if it's going to
[4189.85s -> 4194.41s]  take a thousand years, but let's just say that like Twitch, somebody saves this clip on a hard
[4194.41s -> 4197.53s]  drive and it gets thrown in the dump somewhere. Like a hundred years from now, somebody comes
[4197.53s -> 4202.73s]  across it and they see this clip of me fucking ripping this and they have a heart attack because
[4202.73s -> 4207.13s]  it's worth like $10 million now. We're talking like a thousand years in the future. This is going
[4207.13s -> 4211.37s]  to be one of those like viral videos that people are like, Oh my God, I'm cringing watching him
[4211.37s -> 4218.49s]  open space channel five. It's going to be worth a million. All right. Let me, uh, let me just do
[4218.49s -> 4237.58s]  this safe to turn the power off, right? Let's fast forward to tomorrow. Okay. Here we go. We're good.
[4243.78s -> 4259.53s]  So now we go to settings to three 10, 2019 date and time. Okay. So now, uh, three, uh, three 11,
[4262.07s -> 4278.18s]  right? That's tomorrow, right? Okay. Let's go. Let's see how they're doing tomorrow.
[4287.03s -> 4296.15s]  That's not month. That's day. Holy shit. Someone just gave a hundred bucks. Why is that not on
[4296.15s -> 4305.22s]  screen? Uh, flying muffin man just gave a hundred bucks. Thank you for the a hundred fucking
[4305.22s -> 4309.72s]  goddamn dollars. And they say, Hey man, you're the best. I don't have the attention span to watch
[4309.72s -> 4317.24s]  streams too often, but it will always be a treat to see a new video up. Much love. Hello. Thank you.
[4317.88s -> 4324.74s]  So welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gosset. That means a lot. Thank you, man. Greetings and
[4324.74s -> 4334.95s]  welcome back. You're doing a good job. First, a recap of your previous visit of recap episode
[4334.95s -> 4340.47s]  two, the Nautilus has become prey to the parasitic mushroomers and thus the Gilman were born.
[4341.59s -> 4347.51s]  Gil stands for the gills of a fish. So a Gilman is a being who breathes underwater.
[4350.94s -> 4356.38s]  Gilman has learned human words. Try speaking to him if you haven't already.
[4357.18s -> 4366.28s]  I did that. I did that. At the moment, the habitat contains four Gilman.
[4367.08s -> 4373.59s]  Four Gilman. They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature
[4373.59s -> 4380.49s]  to a more comfortable level. They are suffering. So let us get over to the tank. All right. Well,
[4380.49s -> 4385.37s]  flying muffin man, thank you for the insanely generous amount of money. Thank you. 10,000 bits.
[4386.33s -> 4392.50s]  A heater goes down over time. All right, let's go. How are they doing? Hey, kids, dad's home.
[4396.01s -> 4405.18s]  They know words now. You shouldn't have gone ahead 24 hours. How am I supposed to fucking not?
[4405.18s -> 4411.21s]  You're not. No, we're going to do. We're all right. Let's see. Oh,
[4411.21s -> 4413.21s]  oh,
[4424.60s -> 4428.44s]  okay. I swear to fucking God, this keeps getting stuck on the bottom of my glass,
[4429.48s -> 4438.73s]  but I need it because of the coaster. Slow down. Don't burn them. It just keeps. It's like a
[4438.73s -> 4444.63s]  suction cup when I lift it up and then it falls. Good thing. Good thing. I got this beautiful new
[4444.63s -> 4449.99s]  keyboard. Oh, you guys, I want to make sure you guys see this new keyboard, by the way, pause the
[4449.99s -> 4456.15s]  game. You guys need, would you like to save and end the session? Uh, you know, people have had some
[4456.15s -> 4461.03s]  recommended keyboards. Hey, you should check out like the Logitech, like G 1000 or something,
[4461.03s -> 4464.23s]  right? I'm like, yeah, that one looks kind of good. Razor's got some like fucking awesome
[4464.23s -> 4471.29s]  keyboards. I mean, that's all right. Stick with my own fucking bread and butter right here.
[4472.76s -> 4488.44s]  This is an Amazon basics keyboard came in the mail today. I believe this keyboard was seven
[4488.44s -> 4494.34s]  and a half dollars. I could be wrong. Basic streamer. You don't need all the bells and whistles.
[4495.14s -> 4501.46s]  It's just a block. Guys, I'm going to tell you the biggest scam in all of human history.
[4503.48s -> 4510.12s]  This is just a plastic brick with letter buttons on it. Some people sell you this shit for like
[4510.12s -> 4520.86s]  fucking 300, 400 bucks. This, it's a, it's letter buttons. Don't let anybody fool you.
[4521.50s -> 4530.62s]  Like $400 keyboard and Amazon basics $8 keyboard are the same keyboard. One just clicks has like,
[4530.62s -> 4542.78s]  you know, Oh, I got the O-rings on mine. We both have the same function. You know, don't,
[4542.78s -> 4553.30s]  don't fall for the bullshit. Same thing with the gamer chairs. Look at this thing. This is fine.
[4556.12s -> 4560.84s]  You don't need those, like the big thing that comes up and guess what? Hey, I got one of those
[4560.84s -> 4566.36s]  gamer chairs. All right. Yeah, it's nice. By the way, the rest of my stream forever
[4566.36s -> 4573.14s]  has a billboard advertisement of the company that is fucking that I bought this chair from,
[4573.14s -> 4579.14s]  that I got this chair from. You're a constant advertisement forever. If I got one of those
[4579.14s -> 4587.24s]  chairs, I would just fucking duct tape gun across the whole thing. And they come up so high. I feel
[4587.24s -> 4593.10s]  like I'm sitting in one of those like the egg from the men in black test. Everyone, Will Smith
[4593.10s -> 4597.02s]  is doing like the test and he's in like the fucking egg. I don't want to sit in one of those
[4597.02s -> 4604.36s]  fucking things. No, you can go, you can go to Staples and get this chair for like fucking 80
[4604.36s -> 4614.12s]  bucks, 75 bucks, 40 bucks. You don't need a personalized billboard for a company that you
[4614.12s -> 4620.81s]  fucking probably talk to twice in emails. You know, I got such a good relationship with this
[4620.81s -> 4637.21s]  chair company, you know, I exchanged two emails and they sent one to me. Fucking come on. That
[4637.29s -> 4644.92s]  chair is $150. I have one. How many emails did you exchange? All right, what do I have to do?
[4644.92s -> 4662.98s]  Oh yeah, the heater. They know English words now. That bit sucked. That wasn't a bit. That was me
[4662.98s -> 4672.49s]  speaking in reality. You can tell it's a bit because I'll do the bit voice. You know, this,
[4672.49s -> 4676.49s]  this is the bit voice. Let me tell you something really funny. That's a bit voice. I was just
[4676.49s -> 4687.61s]  speaking as Jeremy Albertson there as a concerned streamer. All right, let's go see what they've
[4687.61s -> 4697.14s]  learned in a day. So a good light heater. Let's make it a little hot. You're doing a bit while
[4697.14s -> 4705.77s]  your kids die. Are they hungry? Well, let's check, check on that. They look a little fatter. Hello?
[4709.06s -> 4723.06s]  I thought you knew English words. You heard it. That was such a shitty burp too. That was just a
[4723.46s -> 4731.21s]  fifth grader burp. That was like I chugged a juice box and tried to do a big burp at the lunch table.
[4735.96s -> 4748.62s]  How are you today? How are you? Seamen. Seamen.
[4749.42s -> 4773.08s]  What? English. More time. You just said more time? English. English. What's the point?
[4781.29s -> 4794.79s]  Already like a nihilistic fish. Crap. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say to this.
[4795.51s -> 4822.68s]  The point is food. Hungry? Hungry? No. How do I? Can I like grab it? I'm sorry.
[4824.84s -> 4836.70s]  English. English. What for? To learn. Spanish. Japanese.
[4839.16s -> 4851.56s]  Japanese. Molo. English. More time. Hurry up. Yeah. All right. Should I feed them? Hungry?
[4854.70s -> 4861.96s]  Check on one of your brothers and sisters. Where are they? Let's try you.
[4863.37s -> 4870.18s]  Where'd you just go? Hello? He heard it but he just didn't respond. Hello?
[4873.05s -> 4899.18s]  Pabra? English. English. I'm learning. Very good. Very good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. No.
[4901.00s -> 4922.47s]  Cool. Learning. Learning. Learning. More. More. More. Good. Good. Good. Very good. Very good. Good.
[4924.62s -> 4933.30s]  Sick dude. English. Teach him fuck. What am I? Like the 13 year old older brother
[4934.10s -> 4951.46s]  that has, you know. No. Hungry? Food? No. All right. What's he doing? Food?
[4953.54s -> 4962.30s]  Should I feed them? It's been a day, right? I think I have to feed them. How many? Are they
[4962.30s -> 4972.60s]  like a camel? Do they eat once a day? Once a week? How much does a sea man eat? Just one pellet a day.
[4972.60s -> 4980.74s]  That sounds good. I got 11 of these. So I got 11, 10 more days worth of food. All right. Let's
[4980.74s -> 4987.11s]  put it down. Go eat. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't let them have the whole thing.
[4989.62s -> 4997.77s]  There's four of you. Come on. Get over here. You're gonna be, you're dead. I love how their feeding
[4997.77s -> 5010.49s]  is just me dropping one cookie crisp into the tank. Ate it. Ate it. Ate it. Food? Good. It was good,
[5010.49s -> 5044.68s]  huh? People. Eat. Eat. Wake up. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Good. Good. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. Hoy. No.
[5045.56s -> 5055.78s]  No. No. There we go. We got yes, good, no. We need to, I need to teach them food.
[5056.66s -> 5068.55s]  Food. Arranger. Food. That's how you do it to a kid. You go, food. And then they get it. Food.
[5074.22s -> 5078.58s]  I'm not going to scream in a microphone. Good. Okay, fine.
[5078.90s -> 5103.46s]  Are you guys all set? Okay, guys. Have a good day. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
[5107.43s -> 5127.51s]  Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. Let's see who we got. They've been fed. We've
[5127.51s -> 5133.42s]  conversed a little. Let's make sure we got a good heaters at eight. Let's put the, put it up to like
[5133.42s -> 5138.46s]  just, I'm going to get this close to 20 as I can. Tell them you love them. They don't understand
[5138.46s -> 5143.40s]  that yet. Teach them their names. They don't know what they, how am I going to do that?
[5143.40s -> 5164.71s]  They know how to say yes, no, and cool. I got to get this a little higher. 19, I'll get it to 19.5
[5164.71s -> 5176.94s]  and then stop. Teach them the value of Bitcoin. Do research. Do research on market trends before
[5177.02s -> 5200.78s]  investing. Do not FOMO into new things. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Don't do
[5200.78s -> 5208.95s]  what Jerma did. I'm implying that I lost a shitload of money. Motherfuck, I gained money.
[5209.51s -> 5222.30s]  I think I just scared him. I scared him out of the tank. I have to get this higher.
[5222.94s -> 5243.62s]  Seaman. Seaman. Seaman. You. Seaman. Seaman. Seaman. You. Seaman. Seaman. Seaman. You. Greg.
[5244.66s -> 5258.82s]  Bamboo. Seaman. Seaman. Greg. Seaman. Greg. Yeah, we. Well, they know Seaman.
[5259.38s -> 5268.38s]  All right, heater's good. Let's get the air of 200. Okay. Would you like to save and end the session?
[5269.10s -> 5276.36s]  Shouldn't be teaching children how to say Greg. What's wrong with Greg?
[5279.62s -> 5310.55s]  Okay, here we go. All right, it's the next day. So maybe I shouldn't be, maybe it should be tomorrow,
[5310.55s -> 5323.56s]  but not completely 24 hours. How's that? That looks good. Looks fine. All right, let's go.
[5323.56s -> 5333.30s]  It's, we're now two days from now. Teach them hatred for other sentient beings.
[5334.10s -> 5352.49s]  Why the hell would I do that? I'll go with like hungry first. Let you know, like, that's how
[5352.49s -> 5359.78s]  my niece, whenever it would be hungry, it'd be like, do you, you, this, this? And she'd go,
[5360.66s -> 5368.50s]  and you go, oh, okay, yeah, she's hungry. Just grow hands. Here we go. Welcome to the laboratory.
[5372.89s -> 5381.03s]  Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. At the moment, the habitat contains
[5382.22s -> 5391.16s]  four Gilmen. They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature
[5391.16s -> 5399.42s]  to a more comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank. Okay. Feed, converse, English,
[5400.22s -> 5410.42s]  all things that need to be considered. Is that a metal straw? It sure is. It's a metal straw.
[5410.98s -> 5417.75s]  I like it because the straw, if you have a cold beverage, the straw gets cold and it makes it,
[5417.83s -> 5422.47s]  when liquid goes up to the tube, it's, uh, it's colder and it felt like that. I like the way it
[5422.47s -> 5430.38s]  sounds. I like the way it feels in the mouth. I prefer a metal or copper straw. All right. How
[5430.38s -> 5450.79s]  are we doing? Hi. Hi. Hi. Fuck you. I'll just talk to your brother. Hi. English. English.
[5452.38s -> 5453.34s]  Talk more of that.
[5458.17s -> 5461.05s]  Oh, they're cold. They're cold. They're cold. Right. Right. Right. Right. I'm just going in there
[5461.05s -> 5470.47s]  going English. Speak English. It's cold. English. Yeah.
[5477.74s -> 5483.50s]  Dirty tank too. All right. All right. Relax. Don't like go more than 17 for now.
[5486.22s -> 5488.22s]  Yeah. Which one's the more talkative?
[5495.86s -> 5500.44s]  Talk a little bit, feed them. How do I do interactions?
[5501.08s -> 5521.40s]  Talk to all of them equally. I can't do that. That's too hard. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning.
[5523.56s -> 5533.37s]  Hi. Hi. How are you? Are you having a good day?
[5533.85s -> 5542.49s]  What's the point? So I can understand you.
[5544.62s -> 5553.91s]  So I can understand you. For me to understand you. Let's talk.
[5560.02s -> 5569.70s]  What's your favorite food? My favorite food is pizza. Hi. Pizza.
[5570.50s -> 5591.58s]  Pizza. My favorite food is pizza. What's your favorite food? Mine's pizza. Hi. Hey. Hello.
[5593.61s -> 5604.28s]  English. This is that was German. How would you how would you learn German? I haven't said any
[5604.28s -> 5614.31s]  German words. No. Yeah. It's Russian. Not German. Nine is German. Russian. Why is he speaking
[5614.31s -> 5636.06s]  Russian? Russian. Russian. English. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.
[5636.78s -> 5647.11s]  Halleray. Pee blood. What are you talking about? It's been nice talking to you. Are you hungry?
[5648.23s -> 5657.05s]  Night night. Night night. Good morning. Play, play, play. You want to play? All right. How do
[5657.05s -> 5666.94s]  you? Would you like to save and end the session? How do I do that? He wants to play. Advice.
[5668.31s -> 5675.56s]  Exchanging food with another razor. Living in harmony. Okay. If a seaman is in a bad mood,
[5675.56s -> 5680.44s]  it will elect to discontinue conversation with you. Whether the cause of this mood swing is
[5680.44s -> 5685.40s]  inadvertent or intentional on your part is of no relevance. The following situations have been
[5685.40s -> 5691.72s]  noted to cause a deterioration of seaman mood. If you are violent towards or speak rudely to
[5691.72s -> 5697.40s]  seaman. If you're constantly using strange or foreign terms that seaman does not understand.
[5698.76s -> 5704.44s]  If you willfully and consistently repeat the same types of words over and over like pizza.
[5707.13s -> 5711.45s]  If you fail to feed seaman over an extended period. If you fail to maintain a suitable living
[5711.45s -> 5718.70s]  environment. If you willfully and continuously flick or grab and pick them up. Pay attention to
[5718.70s -> 5725.00s]  seaman's health. Seaman is a living creature. In order for seaman to remain healthy, it is an
[5725.00s -> 5730.36s]  absolute must for you to provide food, oxygen, and a clean living environment. Pay careful attention
[5730.36s -> 5735.24s]  to the state of the water and oxygen levels. Keep in mind that if you are away and unable to attend
[5735.24s -> 5741.16s]  to seaman for a couple of days, seaman could possibly die. So if I'm away for more than a day
[5741.16s -> 5754.18s]  too, they can die. So how do I interact? This feeding, this carrying, how to interact? Okay,
[5754.18s -> 5760.10s]  tapping the glass with R, flick. While locked on in a close-up, position the hand icon over seaman
[5760.10s -> 5765.22s]  and press and hold R for a few seconds till the icon changes as illustrated, then release it to
[5765.22s -> 5769.62s]  flick. However, note that if you do this too often, seaman may begin to dislike you.
[5770.98s -> 5776.58s]  There's also tickle. Use the zoom function to zero on the seaman and position the hand over it,
[5776.58s -> 5789.21s]  then press X repeatedly. This will put seaman in a good mood. Okay, note, do not attempt to tap,
[5789.21s -> 5796.94s]  flick, or tickle other household pets, wild animals outside of the seaman kit. Seaman is a
[5796.94s -> 5801.90s]  very special creature that will respond to such stimuli. However, other animals not in the seaman
[5801.90s -> 5806.94s]  kit have been known to become far more aggressive when administered such contact and it is not
[5806.94s -> 5830.74s]  advised. Yeah, don't do that to like any birds. All right, so here we go. So, I'm sorry. Okay,
[5830.74s -> 5840.79s]  what about the other one? All right, that's how you just tap that. That's like, okay.
[5844.41s -> 5863.34s]  So, I have to make them all happy. Hello. English. English. So, we're just gonna like pet them all.
[5864.54s -> 5868.86s]  Only focus on one seaman. Well, everyone, people are just pissed off because I was only focusing
[5868.86s -> 5879.45s]  on one of the children. Who's the smartest? Hello. Hello. I think we found the smart one.
[5881.58s -> 5900.38s]  Food. How are you? How are you? Come here. Don't do this to a wild pig, you find.
[5904.44s -> 5908.28s]  If you see a bear, don't run up to him and be like, hey bear, how are you? You're gonna get
[5908.52s -> 5921.10s]  fucking face ripped off. Why would you do that in the first place? Come here. Fun. Does it really
[5921.10s -> 5925.26s]  have to give a warning? Are people gonna sue this company if somebody tried to like pet a bear
[5925.26s -> 5935.00s]  because they played a game about sea monkeys? Having fun? Are you having fun? Fun, fun, fun,
[5935.24s -> 5961.16s]  fun. Let's play. Play. Having fun? Okay. Yeah. In 1776, Columbus signed the Declaration of
[5961.16s -> 5970.87s]  Independence and then the British invaded and we repelled them and then we gained our independence.
[5971.91s -> 5982.89s]  And then a couple of big wars were fought between lots of countries and then the computer came out
[5983.86s -> 5993.67s]  and AOL was the first internet provider and then there was Netscape was a browser that eventually
[5993.67s -> 6004.04s]  turned into Mozilla and after that there was faster internet and when the faster internet came out
[6004.68s -> 6011.82s]  everybody lost their minds and that's kind of where we are now.
[6013.10s -> 6020.49s]  You should be a history teacher. I'm condensing it all. I'm condensing it for the fish.
[6021.50s -> 6029.05s]  That's a lot. Trying to explain to a child like the concept of states that no it's not going to
[6029.05s -> 6041.40s]  happen. There are 50 states in the United States. Hello. He's not paying attention anymore. Come here.
[6041.40s -> 6061.48s]  Having fun? Having fun? Hello. Hello. How are you? Did I feed him today?
[6066.31s -> 6069.51s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay. No, I haven't.
[6075.16s -> 6092.14s]  Come get it. Eat, eat, eat, eat. Good. Very good. We have to get a refill. English or no food. That's
[6092.14s -> 6111.00s]  kind of fucked up. That one didn't even eat. English. English. What for? To learn.
[6113.64s -> 6122.89s]  English. Learn English. Learn English. You first. Implying that I don't know English.
[6123.69s -> 6138.39s]  What a dick. Are you in chat right now? Yeah, I won't. Get fucked, idiot. Easy.
[6140.33s -> 6157.75s]  Easy. What's your favorite thing to do? Flibula. They always love, they love flibula. Fun. Dog.
[6157.83s -> 6176.30s]  Who are you? Seaman. Oh, we're getting progress here. What's your name? Hey. I've said hey so
[6176.30s -> 6192.89s]  many times. That's why. Hey. What is your name? Baby. No, baby. Baby. Baby. You are baby. You are
[6192.89s -> 6210.25s]  baby. Baby. This is the moment we're keeping alive. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. What?
[6211.85s -> 6224.95s]  See you tomorrow. Seaman. Seaman. Yes. Goodbye. Hi. Bye. Hi. Goodbye.
[6224.95s -> 6241.21s]  Bye. See ya. Seaman. Seaman. They have no concept of time. Bye. All right. Let's go.
[6242.46s -> 6255.48s]  Good night. Night. Good night. Good night. Night night. There we go. All right. Let's make sure
[6255.48s -> 6265.66s]  everything's good. Now we're going to skip another day. Do you see what fucking is happening here?
[6265.66s -> 6276.76s]  This is what I'm gonna have to deal with. Every time. Skip a week. No, they'll be dead. I'm not
[6276.76s -> 6287.29s]  doing that. They'll actually be dead. Let's get the 19.5. Nail the coaster to the desk.
[6289.53s -> 6294.81s]  That would ruin the desk. Get an actual coaster. This is an actual coaster.
[6303.29s -> 6309.82s]  What do you get an actual coaster? I bought these. They're coasters. Put salt on the glass.
[6309.82s -> 6317.02s]  All right. Have a good air. It's the lights dimmed. Okay. Would you like to save and
[6317.02s -> 6322.14s]  end the session? Tomorrow. Here we go. Now I have to piss. All right. You got pee break?
[6322.78s -> 6328.12s]  Been two hours? Just about? Has it been two hours? Holy shit. What the fuck have we been doing?
[6333.26s -> 6345.83s]  Jesus. I'm having a good time. Time flies. This shit, apparently. All right. Let me just
[6345.83s -> 6530.47s]  piss it right back. Let me grab a refill. Okay. So I'm going to skip ahead. Is this bad for the
[6530.47s -> 6533.83s]  Dreamcast? I'm not going to fuck up the Dreamcast, right? I think it's old as hell anyways.
[6535.03s -> 6542.01s]  It's like turning it off, turning it on, turning it off, turning it to break it.
[6542.01s -> 6554.12s]  I feel like it's going to cause a problem. All right. Settings 313. Like 8 a.m.
[6554.68s -> 6563.05s]  That sounds pretty good. I'm going to fuck that up. Make sure everyone screams in my fucking mouth
[6564.10s -> 6568.02s]  if I make that the wrong day. Because this has been a long time coming.
[6568.90s -> 6572.98s]  And this is going to take, this is already taking about two hours. If I make that like
[6573.86s -> 6581.27s]  two days ahead or like a month ahead, freak the fuck out and just spam. Because I, that might
[6581.27s -> 6587.29s]  happen. I might change it to like 2020 accidentally. So keep me honest. All right. Here we go.
[6588.25s -> 6602.49s]  313. Closed it up. How do you do that by accident? You've seen some of the dumb
[6602.49s -> 6609.50s]  shit I've done on this stream. You're asking how I would do that by accident. Think of half the
[6609.50s -> 6613.98s]  stuff you've seen on this fucking camera on your television set here that you will like. How the
[6613.98s -> 6622.84s]  fuck did he do that? It's very possible. All right. Let's go. Leonard Nimoy. How are we doing?
[6623.56s -> 6630.47s]  Updates. Change the date to 3019 and sell the game for $10 million.
[6631.43s -> 6639.03s]  Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. How are we? Greetings and welcome back.
[6639.83s -> 6651.80s]  You're doing a good job. At the moment, the habitat contains four human. They are suffering
[6651.80s -> 6657.00s]  from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable. Good,
[6657.00s -> 6663.85s]  not great. I'm doing a good job. Let us head over to the tank. How much more? Okay. I only have like
[6663.85s -> 6677.91s]  eight more days of food. What happens after eight days? Save them all.
[6679.51s -> 6716.82s]  Okay, let's get. Let's see what they say about the goody. Oh, goody. Oh, goody. Yay. Yay. Okay.

[6977.78s -> 6988.09s]  to me. He doesn't want to listen to me. Hello. Hello. He, it's showing the indicator that he's
[6988.09s -> 6995.77s]  hearing me. He just doesn't want to pay attention. Listen. You hurt my feelers.
[7000.71s -> 7026.97s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Go eat brother. Eat brother. Hello. Why does nobody want
[7026.97s -> 7047.46s]  to talk to me anymore? Cold. Cold? Can we get him out of here? This is fucking bad. No wonder they're
[7047.78s -> 7052.90s]  don't want to talk and shit. Like literally this is a dead seaman floating down to the bottom. How
[7052.90s -> 7059.22s]  do I get rid of him? How do I pick this up? This is bad. This is like fucking morbid and terrible.
[7059.22s -> 7094.73s]  Get this out of here. Would you like to save and end the session? Starting over. Exchanging food.
[7094.73s -> 7112.25s]  Living in harmony. Advice. Final pointers. The sanctity of life. How do I remove a dead fish
[7112.25s -> 7123.88s]  from the tank? Grab and lift. Press X to transform the hand to grab while holding X. Press and hold
[7123.88s -> 7134.26s]  R to lift and grab seaman out of the tank. I can't do it. No. He's just gonna have to stay there dead.

[7207.02s -> 7209.50s]  I can't feel.
[7211.90s -> 7226.06s]  Flick him. He's dead.
[7234.68s -> 7241.91s]  Is he alive? He's still talking. Are you still alive? Are you still alive?
[7244.92s -> 7259.14s]  Oh my god. Hi. Raise the temperature. Hello there. No, it's blue. I'm good.

[7262.34s -> 7275.35s]  20. Isn't blue correct? It needs to be 40. No. No. Didn't it say that blue was correct?
[7284.34s -> 7288.18s]  Yeah. No. This is correct. You're not gonna try to. You're not gonna debate me into
[7288.18s -> 7295.77s]  fucking burning my fish alive. 20 is optimal. Yeah. Come on. Excuse me. They're good.

[7536.73s -> 7561.22s]  dark. Where's your brother? Goodbye. I'm upset. Why is everybody upset with me? Well you keep
[7561.22s -> 7569.35s]  leaving him for 12 hours. Should I come back in like three hours this time? Or what? You called
[7569.35s -> 7589.10s]  him Garfield 40 times. Is that why he's pissed off? Food. Food. They've eaten. This is day three.
[7590.92s -> 7598.89s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. They've eaten. Did they eat? Maybe they didn't eat.
[7599.61s -> 7609.14s]  No, they've eaten. No, they did. They ate. They ate. I know. Don't keep repeating words. Okay.
[7610.02s -> 7613.66s]  I'll put up like a thesaurus and start saying different stuff.
[7616.28s -> 7621.69s]  All right. How are we doing? Let's say goodbye. Let's get this to about like 1996.
[7625.14s -> 7635.37s]  That looks good. Oxygen's up. Let's dim the lights a little. And let's go. See you tomorrow. Would
[7635.37s -> 7652.95s]  you like to save and end the session? Hopefully you're both still alive. Let's see what happens.
[7657.99s -> 7679.26s]  Ah. Do English lessons. There we go. 313. Let's make it 314. And make it so it's been less than
[7679.26s -> 7695.96s]  that. 24 hours. 314. That's correct. 314. Let's go ahead and close it. Dreamcast is going to die
[7695.96s -> 7716.22s]  before Seaman does. Read them green eggs in hand. Jeremy, do you have any gray hairs?
[7717.10s -> 7726.90s]  I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. I've had Kim examine my head a few times. Look good.
[7727.54s -> 7737.53s]  Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset. Greetings and welcome back.
[7738.33s -> 7744.26s]  You're doing a good job. It's 4 a.m. I look like I'm shitfaced after a night of partying.
[7744.26s -> 7750.26s]  The Gilmen have begun to suck each other's blood using the tubes on their heads. Did you notice?
[7753.54s -> 7760.66s]  The number of Gilmen has decreased due to natural selection. It seems cruel, but survival of the
[7760.66s -> 7772.78s]  fittest is an integral part of their lives. At the moment, the habitat contains two Gilmen.
[7775.40s -> 7780.04s]  They are suffering from the cold. They always are. Please use the heater to raise the temperature
[7780.04s -> 7789.77s]  to a more comfortable level. Allow me to give you the highlights for today. Highlights? I'm not sure,
[7789.77s -> 7795.45s]  but it seems that Seaman wants a name. Pay close attention to what he says.
[7796.41s -> 7809.80s]  So let us head over to the tank. This is important. All right. Garfield and Garfield and,
[7810.60s -> 7835.51s]  I don't know, Greg, right, right, right, right, right. Here we go. No longer a baby. It's getting
[7835.51s -> 7846.82s]  cold. Turn the heat up. I will. Don't worry. So one of these two is going to eat each other.
[7846.82s -> 7877.35s]  Oh, goody. It's about time. That's much better. Is that George Takai? It might be. Slow down. Don't
[7877.35s -> 7890.14s]  go too hot. All right. That's good. So how are we doing? Let's take a look. Hello. Yeah. Hello.
[7890.94s -> 7904.54s]  Whatever. What's wrong? I must say you've taken very good care of me up to this point.
[7906.65s -> 7923.32s]  Thank you. No, leave me alone. I heard you wanted a name. What is your name? What is your name?
[7924.28s -> 7942.78s]  What's your favorite color? It's not children anymore. Hey. Let's take it down a notch, huh?
[7944.06s -> 7967.86s]  Hey. Hey. Hi. I love you. What? It's rather difficult making out what's on the other side of
[7967.94s -> 7978.50s]  this glass. So let me inquire. Are you a male or a female? Male. You're a male of the species,
[7978.50s -> 7987.22s]  eh? Okay. Yes. Well, I was hoping to meet a lady, but I guess I'm not in a position to be too
[7987.22s -> 8007.74s]  choosy, am I? Not really. I probably should feed. Are you hungry? No. Leave me alone.
[8009.80s -> 8020.17s]  Do you want to play? What do you want? So I was led to believe I would be cared for by a fairly
[8020.17s -> 8027.77s]  young, responsible human being. Right. So far this has proven to be true, but I am wondering
[8027.77s -> 8042.38s]  about your age now. Tell me, are you in your 20s? No. Oh. Hmm. That hurts. Well, then perhaps you
[8042.38s -> 8056.89s]  are a teenager. Is this correct? No. All right. I'm tired of guessing. How old are you then? 33.
[8058.28s -> 8069.54s]  You're 33 years old? Yes. Yes. A 30 something. The body doesn't feel as good the next day after a
[8069.54s -> 8080.74s]  night of revelry. You can't stay up as late. It's tough growing old, huh? Yeah. You got that spot on.
[8081.70s -> 8088.55s]  What is it? So what month is your birthday in?
[8090.55s -> 8096.23s]  Are you going to dox me? Where do you live? What month is your birthday? What's your mother's maiden
[8096.23s -> 8106.90s]  name? September. So what's your answer? Let's try that last question I had for you before again,
[8106.98s -> 8117.54s]  shall we? So what month is your birthday in? September. You were born in September? Yes.
[8118.82s -> 8126.82s]  You know, autumn babies are often melancholy adults. Not that I mean to imply anything. I'm
[8126.82s -> 8131.38s]  just saying- He's talking to a 33 year old fucking- No, I've stuck my fin in my mouth. Melancholy guy.
[8131.38s -> 8144.65s]  He's just kind of roasting me. All I have is he's just destroying me with this like
[8144.65s -> 8149.05s]  fucking fax and all this awful shit and I'm just like, what's your favorite color? What's your
[8149.05s -> 8163.02s]  favorite food? I've got to- Hey, what's your birthday? July 29, 1999. That's odd considering
[8163.02s -> 8175.32s]  you're only three days old. That's very weird. What are your aspirations? What are your goals?
[8177.30s -> 8192.23s]  What do you like? Hey, why all the noise? What do you like? What do you like? Yes. So
[8193.43s -> 8210.81s]  what day is your birthday on? All right, let's try that one more time. What day were you born?
[8213.82s -> 8223.61s]  Let's think about what you said, shall we? I'm just gonna get my like name, my birthday, the fourth.
[8225.38s -> 8243.19s]  Let's take it down a notch, huh? Anyways, how has your day been? No, go away. Fine, I'm gonna do the
[8243.19s -> 8249.67s]  streamer joke. Are you ready? You all here? There's almost 6,000 people here. I will do the fucking
[8249.67s -> 8267.78s]  streamer joke, the YouTuber joke. Here we go. Fuck you. You can go away. It's really not a difficult
[8267.78s -> 8282.49s]  question. I said, so what day is your birthday on? Fourth. What's all that racket? I said the fourth.
[8289.74s -> 8300.76s]  I thought I'm like not paying any attention to the brother. He's gonna- he's gonna fucking
[8300.76s -> 8309.42s]  borg this motherfucker anyways. Who cares? This is our seaman. What is your name? Seaman. Seaman
[8309.58s -> 8321.72s]  Jones. It's really not a difficult question. I said, so what day is your birthday on?
[8322.92s -> 8332.74s]  Four. The fourth? Yes. Well, I'm sorry, but don't expect any presents from me, okay?
[8333.46s -> 8344.94s]  I'm just a poor seaman trying to make ends meet. Liar. Are you hungry? No, thanks.
[8345.58s -> 8351.05s]  Can I still like pet him? Or is this like- is he gonna be- is it like-
[8358.60s -> 8359.64s]  Don't make me laugh.
[8362.60s -> 8378.74s]  I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. I don't know what to say. I thought he wanted a name.
[8380.98s -> 8392.84s]  Pick him up. I'm not gonna- no, I don't want him to hate me. Good afternoon. No, it's not. What time is
[8392.84s -> 8405.86s]  it? Hello? What time is it? Now, where on earth do you think I could wear a wristwatch?
[8408.94s -> 8413.34s]  Decrease the oxygen in the water, but don't do enough to kill him. Just starve his brain of IQ.
[8413.34s -> 8420.47s]  That's fucking diabolical. What is wrong with you? Drop the oxygen in the tank to starve his
[8420.47s -> 8436.28s]  brain of oxygen so his IQ drops. I will name you. I will name you. So what are you looking at me for?
[8438.86s -> 8445.02s]  I want to name- I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct,
[8445.02s -> 8453.58s]  you must be a virgin, right? I meant Virgo. Sorry, I know Virgos are very sensitive.
[8453.58s -> 8459.10s]  I hope I didn't hurt your feelings. No, I'm not, so sorry. Honestly, it's none of my business what
[8459.10s -> 8466.58s]  you do in your free time. Hey, no, what's up? No, I'm not a virgin, actually. What about you?
[8467.70s -> 8477.90s]  What about you? I am Seaman. Applause, please. Because to me, you're kind of just been in a
[8477.90s -> 8487.13s]  tank this whole time, decimated by Chad Jones. No, actually, he gave me a false statement,
[8487.13s -> 8490.49s]  and I threw it right back in this tank, and he doesn't even want to respond.
[8494.49s -> 8505.54s]  What's up? All right, let's see the other ones as much as a dick. Where is the other one? Up here.
[8506.79s -> 8529.94s]  Hey. Hi there. Hello. Hello. Hello. This one doesn't want to talk. Are you there? Are you there? Okay,
[8529.94s -> 8536.82s]  this one's dumb. He just swam his head into a pole. I think this one's just food. Yeah,
[8536.82s -> 8559.46s]  this one's just food. Let's get the heat up a little. Try it one more time. Good morning. Good
[8559.46s -> 8576.57s]  morning. Ow, knock it off. Are you awake? Excuse me. What's the problem? Finally, Jesus. What is
[8576.57s -> 8589.26s]  your name? Seaman. Seaman Jones. You both can't be Seaman. That's not your name. I am Seaman. Hear
[8589.26s -> 8600.12s]  me roar. You are not. That was interesting. We'll speak again soon. Is that me telling me that he
[8600.12s -> 8612.57s]  doesn't want to talk to me anymore? What do you want to be when you grow up? What's up? What do
[8612.65s -> 8618.02s]  you want to be when you grow up? No, leave me alone.
[8629.51s -> 8650.09s]  Okay, we're good. Anybody hungry before I go? No, not yet. Okay, so let's go.
[8651.86s -> 8655.22s]  He said he's not hungry. Feed? I guess I have to, right? I'm gonna be gone for a while.
[8656.10s -> 8662.38s]  I'm still full. Are you trying to fatten me for slaughter?
[8662.62s -> 8671.72s]  Pick it back up. Sorry, sorry. Just leave, leave, leave, leave. Get out. Would you like to save and-
[8672.36s -> 8678.33s]  Tomorrow. Next day. I'm completely invested in this now. I need to know everything about it.
[8678.81s -> 8695.93s]  All right, let's try again. Okay, so this is technically, this is going on five days game time,
[8695.93s -> 8710.04s]  right? I think. Should be, right? 315. No, no, no, no, no. Back it up.
[8710.04s -> 8725.13s]  When do we start? I don't remember, like the 10th? We started, I've lost track of time. I don't even
[8725.13s -> 8733.42s]  know what day it is now in real life. The 10th, right? This is playing with my brain. All right,
[8733.42s -> 8749.24s]  here we go. See if any of the new developments. This whole game is an elaborate phishing scam.
[8749.24s -> 8765.38s]  In a few days, the seaman will access your bank account info. What happens if you set time
[8765.38s -> 8771.91s]  backwards? That's a really good question. I have no idea. Would the game just break?
[8772.79s -> 8775.78s]  Or would they revert back to eggs? Good evening.
[8777.78s -> 8786.97s]  Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good
[8786.97s -> 8799.19s]  job. At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men. They appear to be very hungry.
[8802.73s -> 8810.60s]  Let me divulge the highlights for today. Would you like to give seaman a name? Call one of the
[8810.60s -> 8816.28s]  gill men and try saying, I will give you a name. I will give you a name. So let us head over to
[8816.28s -> 8832.62s]  the tank. So I have to feed immediately. Greg and Garfield, yeah. Chad, no, that's too easy.
[8840.14s -> 8849.14s]  I'm hungry. All right, just eat. Give me something to eat. I'm starved. Hey, thanks.
[8850.58s -> 8857.54s]  Where's the other one? Turn it on again. The other one didn't get to eat.
[8858.34s -> 8864.06s]  Do I have to drop another one in there? The other one?
[8868.94s -> 8890.02s]  How about turning up the heat? Peaceful. It's heated up. So he ate this one over here on the right.
[8890.98s -> 8914.84s]  Now we're good. Slow it down. That should stop at about 19 something. Hey. Hi. Shouldn't you be out
[8915.56s -> 8922.68s]  partying or something? I mean, this is technically a party. I will give you a name.
[8925.27s -> 8931.51s]  Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name. When you've decided what you want to call me, say,
[8931.51s -> 8939.83s]  I'm ready. I'm ready. All right, then. Here's how to do it. You're going to say my new name
[8939.83s -> 8951.59s]  three times. Each time I say now, say the name once. Got it? Now. Greg. One more time. Greg.
[8952.95s -> 8961.51s]  One more time. Greg. Okay, I'll remember that. Next time you want to call me, call me using that
[8961.51s -> 8967.99s]  name. And don't forget the name you gave me. Because if you do, I'm not going to tell you
[8967.99s -> 8980.65s]  what it is. Well, I think that pretty much covers it later. Hey, Greg. Greg. Okay, just be sure to
[8980.65s -> 8993.26s]  save some for later. What? All right, now I gotta give you a name. I will give you a name. I will
[8993.26s -> 9008.28s]  give you a name. I will give you a name. Hey. Hey. Food. Here. No, why? He's gonna become food
[9008.28s -> 9020.36s]  and he's gonna be eaten by his brother. Why is this one the smork? Go get it. Oh, good. Food.
[9023.13s -> 9047.86s]  Right here. Now will you talk? There you go. Okay. Hi. I will give you a name. I will give you a name.
[9049.06s -> 9070.42s]  My compliments to the chef. I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. Listen. Listen. Not right now.
[9074.44s -> 9082.92s]  You are the dumb one. You're the dumb one. And you are just food for your brother. I just want to
[9082.92s -> 9088.70s]  make sure you're aware of that. I have to make it very clear. You are in this tank to provide
[9088.70s -> 9118.47s]  sustenance to the smart one. Doesn't seem to care. Hey, you hungry? Greg. Greg. Hey, Greg.
[9120.34s -> 9138.09s]  What do you want? Greg, come over here. Does he pee? Do they actually pee?
[9139.61s -> 9153.93s]  I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. Don't make me laugh. Be nice to your brother. Can't see
[9154.01s -> 9165.37s]  anything. I share a name with the seaman so it's throwing me off. Hey, Greg. Greg. That would be
[9165.37s -> 9177.53s]  really weird. Clean the tank? The only way you clean the tank is you just put air in it. Hey, Greg.
[9180.82s -> 9191.34s]  Greg. Great. Now everyone will want one. What one? What are you talking about? Greg. What the fuck is that?
[9191.34s -> 9217.80s]  Adieu. What the hell is this? What is that? Is it an egg? What is this? Whose egg is this? Put this
[9217.80s -> 9229.94s]  tongue in that mouth. Dream on. That's poop? Uh, there's no way that's poop. That did not...
[9230.98s -> 9234.90s]  A big brick cement shit like that did not come out of one of these things.
[9235.62s -> 9255.82s]  There's an egg. That's a big ball of shit, okay? Let's play. Hey, Greg. Hey, settle down there.
[9256.70s -> 9267.26s]  Let's play. Do you want to play? I could use a hug. Okay, that's all I needed to hear.
[9272.65s -> 9286.65s]  Quit it. Quit it. It hurts. English. I'm not ignoring you. I'm thinking. What are you thinking
[9286.65s -> 9313.19s]  about? Hello. What are you thinking about? It's a secret. Okay. Tell me. What's up? America. America.
[9314.87s -> 9326.60s]  Look who's talking. Do you like America? You can go away. Remember when you were like
[9327.32s -> 9332.12s]  12 years old in a chat room for the first time? You went into like the international chat room?
[9332.92s -> 9341.70s]  And you literally just wrote, do you like America? And they're like, yeah, I guess. Yeah.
[9341.70s -> 9355.38s]  And they're like, do you like Japan? And you're like, yeah. You guys didn't do that? You guys...
[9355.38s -> 9360.50s]  Wait, that's because I was... Okay, my means of chat room. You guys don't understand this.
[9360.50s -> 9364.82s]  You have like a Twitch chat room right now. You've got all kinds of forums. You've got like Reddit.
[9365.38s -> 9373.00s]  Back in my day, we had Diablo II battle net and like wrestling fucking chat rooms. That's all there
[9373.00s -> 9396.65s]  was. I didn't have a Twitch chat. I had a Diablo II chat in a random battle net server. It was
[9396.65s -> 9404.74s]  incredible to talk to somebody on the other side of the world back then. It was. And kids these days
[9404.74s -> 9415.40s]  don't even realize. When you talk to somebody from Japan 20 years ago, it was like boom. Your
[9415.40s -> 9430.34s]  brain just could not comprehend it. Let's have a conversation. Let's talk. No, I'm all talked out
[9430.34s -> 9438.86s]  for today. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Bye bye. Don't eat your brother while I'm gone.
[9440.65s -> 9452.12s]  No, leave me alone. Good. We are reaching critical boomer. Goodbye. Goodbye,
[9453.00s -> 9460.71s]  food. That's really mean and fucked up. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Let's go. Would you like to
[9460.71s -> 9474.36s]  save and it was crazy. If you were back in the day, if you were on the internet and somebody
[9474.36s -> 9481.27s]  picked up the telephone, it would the whole thing would break. It's got their Instagram and their
[9481.27s -> 9495.67s]  Twitter. You start to go to a pay. I'm sorry. I forgot to turn it off. Sorry for the blue. I'm
[9495.67s -> 9503.13s]  sorry. Yeah, back. I couldn't make a phone call from a device in my pocket. I had to go to a
[9503.13s -> 9515.85s]  pay phone and put in a quarter. I have Twitter. Yeah, but I tweet like once every three weeks.
[9516.49s -> 9523.75s]  All right, let's go. That looks all right. Let's go to like four for two in the morning.
[9529.86s -> 9535.13s]  Wrong date. We talked about it. That's fine. 316. That's the Stone Cold number.
[9546.22s -> 9553.69s]  I wish I could have experienced the dawn of the internet like you. It was pretty weird.
[9554.25s -> 9571.11s]  I remember playing Command and Conquer. Red alert. Neighbors. It was wild. It was a weird time. Yeah,
[9571.11s -> 9575.59s]  you just build power plants into the other person's base and then send 20 tonyas over
[9575.59s -> 9584.30s]  there. That was the strategy every time. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job.
[9587.90s -> 9592.70s]  First, a recap of your previous visit. You have given a name to one of the Gilmen.
[9593.50s -> 9601.42s]  His coloration has changed, so you should be able to locate him easily. Please take good care of him.
[9601.42s -> 9607.96s]  So that's the one that we have to take care of. Oh, yes. They have started to produce droppings.
[9608.92s -> 9621.59s]  The tubes on their heads serve many purposes. At the moment, the habitat contains two Gilmen.
[9621.59s -> 9625.59s]  That's weird. They have a forehead butthole. They are suffering from the cold.
[9626.39s -> 9630.23s]  Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level. They like poop out of the
[9630.23s -> 9633.43s]  top of their head. So let us head over to the tank. Somebody just said shit for brains.
[9634.39s -> 9655.27s]  It's cold in here. Please increase the temperature.
[9658.47s -> 9661.75s]  I thought I was definitely going to suffocate for a minute there.
[9663.59s -> 9702.33s]  Hey sup, boomer. Hey sup. Yay. It's the movie phone voice. Oh my god, I forgot about the movie
[9702.33s -> 9708.33s]  phone voice. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1. If you know the name
[9708.33s -> 9712.65s]  of the movie you'd like to see, press 2. Holy shit, that's so old. Is that guy still alive?
[9713.37s -> 9721.42s]  Hey you. You used to have to do that. You had to call a fucking service on the phone to find out
[9721.42s -> 9728.57s]  what time the movie was playing. You know how easy you've got it now? We had to listen to a weird
[9728.57s -> 9737.38s]  robot guy give us every movie that was playing in the theater. Unbelievable how easy it is for you.
[9738.82s -> 9742.66s]  I used to have to walk to a pay phone and call movie phone. It was two and a half miles.
[9746.79s -> 9754.07s]  Okay, don't answer me. What did he say? Greetings and salutations my good friend.
[9754.07s -> 9765.59s]  How are you? Hello. Well hello. I'm thinking about some food, eh? You got it.
[9767.77s -> 9792.02s]  Food coming in hot. Hey, thanks. You're welcome. What's your name? Hello. Oh yummy,
[9792.02s -> 9798.58s]  baity goodness. Well you are the bait so that's true. Did you eat it? Okay, you have to eat too.
[9800.66s -> 9807.03s]  Technically I am a millennial. I know I'm a millennial. I know that. I want the recipe for
[9807.03s -> 9814.15s]  whatever that was. It's called molded together oats and like soy sauce probably. I don't know.
[9814.15s -> 9819.19s]  What is, how do you make fish food? It's like soy sauce and rolled oats and they crush it up
[9819.19s -> 9831.34s]  and blend it up and put it in a like salt shaker. Good morning. Hey, why all the noise? I'm sorry.
[9833.34s -> 9845.11s]  So what did you do today? What's up? What did you do today? What do you want?
[9845.83s -> 9855.27s]  Do you have any questions? Do you have any questions? Hey, hey, I've got something to say.
[9856.23s -> 9863.78s]  Hello. I just remembered something. Some of my memories are coming back. What is going on?
[9863.78s -> 9869.38s]  We're gonna get cut scene? There was this French man named Jean Paul Gasset who was trying to
[9869.38s -> 9876.98s]  raise me and he made this cage to hold insects and there were a lot of really tasty looking
[9876.98s -> 9885.30s]  insects in it. Is it still there? Can you take a look? Okay, so after a while some moth larva
[9885.30s -> 9891.94s]  will start growing in there. When that happens, use the L trigger to switch screens and grab a
[9891.94s -> 9938.06s]  larva and drop it in here. Can you do that for me? Yeah. Yes. So these not ready yet? That's wrong?
[9938.86s -> 9949.58s]  That's an egg. Oh, fuck. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? How do I fix this? How do I fix
[9949.58s -> 9954.98s]  that? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Can I get more of those? Do I have to reset? I
[9954.98s -> 9974.30s]  can't reset. There's no resetting in this game. I can't pick it back up. I still have one.
[9975.58s -> 9980.86s]  Unplug the console. It's fine. Okay. You can get more. You just need to water the other seed and
[9980.86s -> 9999.13s]  it makes more. Okay. Cool. Moisten the cage. Spray. How much do I have to spray? More spray?
[10001.46s -> 10034.47s]  It's red. Okay. It's good. Can I go? Can I overspray? Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[10034.47s -> 10040.73s]  I'm overspraying. Okay. No, that's it. It's already dead. It's not, there's no, it's not even,
[10040.73s -> 10050.39s]  it's already dead. All right. What does anyone want to know? Let's talk. Hey. Let's take it down a notch,
[10050.39s -> 10063.90s]  huh? Any questions? Yes. Do you have any questions? Let's have a conversation.
[10069.45s -> 10086.95s]  I will give you a name. What's up? I will give you a name. I will give you a name.
[10088.07s -> 10101.29s]  I will give you a name. That's not Greg. I'm thinking about some food, eh?
[10114.49s -> 10128.47s]  Greg, no, Greg is over here. What's up? Okay. Let's talk about, no, maybe tomorrow. What the
[10128.55s -> 10149.38s]  fuck? Today. Hey, thanks. What are you doing? What is he doing? Let's talk today. Tomorrow.
[10149.38s -> 10161.11s]  We'll talk again tomorrow. Let's talk today. Oh my god. If the larva things die, you have to start
[10161.11s -> 10172.33s]  over again. So make sure that this is always up to, up to being sprayed. So these are eggs and I have
[10172.33s -> 10183.99s]  to pick up the larva and feed. So I gotta be very careful about that. 100 spray, 100 spray.
[10186.90s -> 10192.58s]  I can't, I don't want to mess that up. Okay. Let's go back. Just turn the heat up a little.
[10194.17s -> 10202.90s]  We'll talk tomorrow. We'll talk tomorrow. Always make sure there's at least one egg
[10202.90s -> 10209.06s]  or larva in at all times and do not mess with the seeds. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[10209.06s -> 10219.96s]  too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot. Cool it down. That's enough. That's fine. It'll be all
[10219.96s -> 10234.52s]  right. Goodbye. All right. Next day. I didn't kill one of them. What are you talking about?
[10240.49s -> 10258.94s]  No. Okay. You just get the shit out of me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Oh no, he's immune.
[10260.46s -> 10263.53s]  I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. Sayonara.
[10269.64s -> 10277.86s]  Hello. Goodbye. Good night. But I'm not tired. I was gonna scream go to bed as
[10277.86s -> 10281.54s]  loud as I could, but that was a bad idea. All right. Here we go. We got air light.
[10281.54s -> 10286.46s]  Let's dim it a little. See you tomorrow. Would you like to save and
[10291.67s -> 10296.92s]  peek, Mike? The other one's not an adult. When you name him, it makes him an adult. At least
[10296.92s -> 10301.88s]  that's what the guide says. Yeah. Every time I try to name that fish, it just doesn't,
[10301.88s -> 10308.34s]  doesn't want to do it. All right. Make sure I don't get you a blow. Get the blue.
[10309.22s -> 10321.56s]  There we are. Let's go. One more day. Another day. More evolution. Uh, that is Leonard Nimoy.
[10321.56s -> 10332.62s]  That's correct. That is Spock. What the fuck just happened? That is the Spider-Man down
[10332.62s -> 10347.93s]  the top of my mic. 317. 2019. Like, let's go like 11 30 or so. 317. Man, this would have been a
[10347.93s -> 10358.17s]  pain in the ass. You would have to play this for a week to get this far. That's way too long.
[10359.62s -> 10365.13s]  That's more than 24 hours. Wait, what? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10365.13s -> 10377.40s]  317. That's 11 39. What are you talking about? All right. Because it's okay. All right. All right.
[10377.40s -> 10385.26s]  That is way too long. How about it? Like 130. That's almost two days. That's good.
[10390.57s -> 10398.84s]  You can do up to two days. Yeah, but I don't want to do that. So it was just 316 at like one or two
[10398.84s -> 10410.52s]  AM. Now it's 317 at like one AM. One 30. They're not going to be dead. That's fine. Cause it was
[10410.52s -> 10418.12s]  like three AM before I just itched my nose and my nose and my nostril got stuck for a full second.
[10418.12s -> 10423.48s]  I don't know if it, did anybody see that happen? I went like this and the nostril was closed and
[10423.48s -> 10429.37s]  then opened by itself a second later. It was really weird. All right. That's fine. I'm going
[10429.37s -> 10444.89s]  to go with 130 thoughts on killing the seaman. Why would I do that? All right. 317 at one 30 AM.
[10445.69s -> 10449.93s]  I want to see what I just want to see. I'm going to like zoom in and look. I'm actually curious
[10449.93s -> 10469.46s]  to how fucking weird that looked. I didn't, no, it didn't do anything. I thought that was way more
[10469.46s -> 10483.75s]  interesting than it was. All right. Let's go close it up. I was going to do with like my feet. I was
[10483.75s -> 10487.99s]  going for an hour. Did he starve the seaman yet? No, they do. I got two. They're doing very well.
[10487.99s -> 10520.26s]  They're both doing just fine. Bye. Fuck. Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of
[10520.26s -> 10531.90s]  Jean Paul Garcet. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. Oh, my mouth. Let's see.
[10532.78s -> 10539.02s]  You have obtained the insect cage. This will be helpful in raising more food for seaman.
[10540.15s -> 10547.35s]  Keep your eye on it. Something will happen within shortly. Okay. Oh, the spray.
[10548.47s -> 10554.55s]  The insect cage is equipped with a spray to keep the moisture level up. Please don't forget to use
[10554.55s -> 10568.74s]  it. At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men. They appear to be very hungry.
[10572.46s -> 10580.01s]  Allow me to divulge today's highlights. Gil man has been growing and would love some variety in
[10580.01s -> 10586.33s]  his meals. Try giving him some larva from the other tank. I'm sure he'll be pleased.
[10587.29s -> 10598.74s]  So let us head over to the tank. Start lifting the weights of loser. Quiet. Remember 33. If you
[10598.74s -> 10605.40s]  were to guess my age right now, what would you think? Jeremy? Wow. I mean, I would have guessed
[10605.40s -> 10616.38s]  like 25. 24. Really? Double threes. I'm doing just fine. You understand? I'm doing just fine.
[10617.35s -> 10623.02s]  Double threes. Don't fucking look at that. That's so embarrassing. What a fucking idiot.
[10623.98s -> 10627.42s]  Give me something to eat. No, I'm a human. I sweat. That's what people do.
[10627.42s -> 10646.14s]  Relax. We're all humans. I'm older than Jesus. I don't, I can't, of what context are you talking
[10647.10s -> 10652.73s]  about? It's hilarious you kids talking shit about Jeremy. You wouldn't say this to him at land.
[10655.40s -> 10660.20s]  I don't go to lands. I'm good enough to participate in the land. So you probably
[10660.20s -> 10678.71s]  wouldn't see me there. Hey, listen. Oh, goodie. Larva time. Other than your weird forehead window,
[10678.71s -> 10687.26s]  you look great for your age. What's a forehead window? Your forehead window? Oh, good. I'm
[10687.26s -> 10692.15s]  feeling a little warmer. I'm starving to death. I don't know what that means.
[10693.96s -> 10698.20s]  Okay, finless wonder. Joke's over. Feed. Okay, let's get some food in here.
[10699.32s -> 10715.34s]  Why is there no egg here? How do I get an egg? Guys? Egg? How? Are you going to starve me to death?
[10716.14s -> 10724.31s]  Feed me right now. Well, come eat. Hey, thanks for the food. Go eat it.
[10725.03s -> 10737.80s]  Yeah, this really is the monster rancher monster. Okay, so you fed. Is it still alive? Oh, good.
[10737.80s -> 10745.10s]  Food. The seed sprouted into a little plant. You can eat this too? All right, thank god. I want
[10745.10s -> 10752.07s]  the recipe for whatever that was. All right, let me go back here and see this. It has a seed now.
[10753.19s -> 10760.74s]  There's a little plant there, so I need to spray. So will these things? I've never gotten here.
[10761.54s -> 10765.14s]  So if I spray, these things will all stay alive and that plant will grow.
[10774.06s -> 10788.09s]  Always leave one of them in here. Okay. Yeah, the plant will feed larva. Okay. So always leave one
[10788.09s -> 10797.86s]  bug. Always. Always. Okay. So they've been fed today. So that's good. You guys are good to go.
[10800.09s -> 10808.41s]  So let's chat. Where'd you go? Are we good? Make it a little hotter. Talk to the bugs. Hey, you.
[10812.79s -> 10826.95s]  I'm back. Let's chat. Bonjour. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Beware of green beer.
[10828.15s -> 10842.55s]  I forgot we were teleporting forward in time. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Like the spice. Let's chat.
[10848.58s -> 10856.26s]  Tell me, what do you do for a living? Streamer. You're an athlete?
[10856.34s -> 10867.19s]  No. Well, then what do you do for a living? Actor. Let's take it down a notch, huh?
[10868.15s -> 10887.48s]  He knows. He knows that was horseshit. Let's chat. Let me start over. I said,
[10888.76s -> 10897.18s]  tell me, what do you do for a living? Clown. Okay, I'm going to try this once more.
[10897.34s -> 10904.57s]  Once more. What do you do for a living? Clown. You're a plumber?
[10907.91s -> 10912.87s]  Yes. Perhaps you can tell us all what shoes go with a tool belt.
[10915.83s -> 10935.80s]  Close enough. I'm a clown plumber. What do you want? Let's chat. Well, I could go on and on and
[10936.36s -> 10943.90s]  so I'd better stop right now. It's been a pleasure. Saving. What did it save? The fact that he said he...
[10946.07s -> 10960.18s]  How old are you? How old are you? Well, aren't we rude? I will rip you from this tank,
[10961.27s -> 10968.63s]  put you in a pan with a coat of butter on it, sear both sides, and serve you to a rich family
[10968.63s -> 10990.33s]  at a rich restaurant if you don't start talking to me. He don't fucking care. Anything else?
[10993.80s -> 11013.59s]  What's up? Greg. Greg. Goodbye. Greg, what's up, dude? Word. Greg, can you sing? Sing me a song.
[11014.31s -> 11026.20s]  Did I tell you guys that I walked... Would you like to save and end the session?
[11026.20s -> 11033.51s]  I didn't tell you this yet. I walked to auto yesterday and I saw him. I saw the car. I saw
[11033.51s -> 11053.48s]  exactly who it was. Described the car. It had... All you need to know is, yes, it had a racing
[11053.48s -> 11061.64s]  stripe on the top. That's all you need to know because of course it does. Would you like to
[11061.64s -> 11065.88s]  save and end the session? Yes. I fucking... I couldn't get the license plate so I like...
[11066.20s -> 11072.94s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I didn't catch it though. He was going like 50. I could only run
[11072.94s -> 11083.85s]  like 30 or 40 so... All right. Anything else you got? Let's have a conversation. Let's have a
[11083.85s -> 11097.94s]  conversation. What? What do you think of humans? What do you want? What do you think of humans?
[11100.38s -> 11112.14s]  Let's talk. Let's talk. No, I'm done for today. This is the original Clash of Clans.
[11113.78s -> 11121.16s]  I gotta come back and play tomorrow. Can I like drop some fucking gems in here?
[11123.94s -> 11138.36s]  Good night. Hey, why all the noise? Greg, let's talk. Greg. Bu-bye. Greg. Greg. Remember to chew.
[11140.79s -> 11148.17s]  Change your console's clock. What the fuck was that? Yeah, we've been changing. I've been going a
[11148.17s -> 11158.89s]  week. Did he just shit? All right, let's make sure everything's good to go. Talk to the brother. I
[11158.89s -> 11162.98s]  keep trying to. The brother doesn't want anything to do with me. Every time I try to initiate a
[11162.98s -> 11189.11s]  conversation, he just doesn't say anything. Hi. Hello. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yes. Listen. Are you listening
[11189.11s -> 11225.58s]  to me? Are you listening to me? I will give you a name. I will name you. I'm just trying to get his
[11225.58s -> 11238.01s]  attention. Hello. No, this one doesn't talk. What? Quit it. Hello. It hurts. What's up? What's going
[11238.01s -> 11243.61s]  on? He doesn't want to even. What do you want? He won't even respond to anything I'm saying.
[11245.00s -> 11255.69s]  Let's talk. No, I'm done for today. Oh my god, of course you are. Pick him up. Stop it. Let me go.
[11255.77s -> 11264.49s]  What are you doing? Let me go. Talk to me. Come on. Let me go. Masher. Masher. He's dying. Okay,
[11264.49s -> 11274.94s]  put him back in. You good? Hey, settle down there. Now he's gonna listen to me. Hi. Right, I know.
[11274.94s -> 11287.56s]  Finally. Are you hungry? Here it comes. Well, here we go. What comes? Oh, he just pooped out of his
[11287.56s -> 11299.59s]  head. Okay. All right. Good night. Goodbye. Let's just make sure everything's fine. Heat it up to
[11299.59s -> 11305.93s]  about 19.5. Make sure the spray is at 100 and come back. Boil them. No, I'm not doing that.
[11308.33s -> 11313.80s]  I'm not gonna. I'm not going to kill these fish. The stream has been going on for three hours.
[11315.75s -> 11322.41s]  I'm. If you want me to end the whole thing. Would you like to. How are we doing over here? A big plant?
[11323.05s -> 11335.32s]  You have to understand something. This would be. I would waste the entire three hours if I just. Oh,
[11335.32s -> 11339.16s]  let me turn it up as much as it goes and we'll get to see them turn on their side and go up.
[11341.22s -> 11352.66s]  No. Would you like to save and end the session? He's supposed to ask multiple questions. Yeah,
[11352.66s -> 11362.49s]  he's I think he just doesn't like me. Easy. Here we go. Fast forward a day. You can play
[11362.49s -> 11367.53s]  Seaman 2 after this. I can't. Unless I have a Japanese console. Because that is a Japanese
[11367.53s -> 11379.30s]  only game. It never came out in the West. So it's now going to be the 18th of March.
[11379.94s -> 11392.54s]  Yeah, there is a two for some reason. It is 317 at 154. Let's go ahead and make it.
[11393.82s -> 11405.74s]  318 at 54. So at 1254. We had five community subjects coming right now. Five community
[11405.74s -> 11413.46s]  subs from Harmony Accord. Thank you. Five spot. Congratulations to those who got the five
[11413.46s -> 11423.22s]  community subs. And again, thanks for the fucking subs. 318 2019. We've been playing this game for
[11424.58s -> 11429.14s]  eight days at this point. After school, we come home off the bus and we sprint home
[11429.86s -> 11450.38s]  for eight straight days. After school at one in the morning. Yeah. You stayed at
[11450.38s -> 11457.53s]  the extracurricular activity. I don't know. You might be in like the drama club. Maybe you're
[11457.53s -> 11469.50s]  doing shop. You're in the math club. All you said to him when he was a baby was English and pizza.
[11470.06s -> 11477.94s]  No wonder he hates you. Anonymous Gifter just gave five community subs. Good evening. Thank you,
[11477.94s -> 11487.08s]  whoever it was. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Greetings and welcome back.
[11487.88s -> 11495.91s]  You're doing a good job. First, a recap of your previous visit. I seem so dedicated. The eggs in
[11495.91s -> 11501.19s]  the insect cage have hatched into larvae. It is important to raise them carefully.
[11502.15s -> 11508.07s]  If you put too many larvae into the tank, you may find yourself running out of food for seaman later.
[11509.64s -> 11514.92s]  But if you manage the larva well, you should have no problem keeping seaman well fed.
[11520.12s -> 11531.14s]  At the moment, the habitat contains two human. They appear to be very hungry. So let us head
[11531.14s -> 11545.06s]  over to the tank. Here we go. Do not remove the memory card during gameplay. Fucking kid. Don't
[11545.06s -> 11552.74s]  remove it. I had four before. Yeah. When they were babies and then they started eating each other.
[11557.38s -> 11568.84s]  It's cold in here. Sweet oxygen. Feed me right now. Five more community subs.
[11569.64s -> 11575.46s]  Potter fan. Oh, it's 15 in a row here. Thank you so much, Potter fan. Thanks a lot, guys.
[11584.60s -> 11585.08s]  Those are going.
[11587.10s -> 11606.79s]  Heat it up. Turn the light on. Hey, food here now. Hey, player, drop some chips in here.
[11607.75s -> 11617.43s]  Let's take a look. Give me something to eat. Just relax. I'm starving. Let's stop at 18.2. There we
[11617.43s -> 11625.67s]  go. Now we should be good at 18.9. That should get you 19.5, 19.6, 19.7, 19.7, 19.8. 19. All right,
[11625.67s -> 11634.09s]  here we go. Here's a plant. So we've got how many larvae in here? Maybe I shouldn't even use one.
[11635.21s -> 11641.85s]  Maybe I should just drop the pellets in. Another five community subs from Magellan. Another five.
[11642.57s -> 11651.59s]  Thank you. More 20 community subs now. More like 30 because Bebraham just came in with 10.
[11652.89s -> 11660.65s]  Thank you to all of you. And now here comes another five from Scrumpledungus. Thank you for five.
[11660.65s -> 11672.18s]  Thank you, Bebraham, for 10. The subs just rolled in hard here. Thank you. Thank you for like the
[11672.18s -> 11686.20s]  40 community subs right now. More than that. Jesus, thank you. That's a lot of subs. Missed me. I
[11686.20s -> 11692.18s]  didn't get one. Remember when I was, I was going to give like a thousand community subs, wasn't I?
[11692.18s -> 11699.88s]  If I fucked up that, oh my God. Amscoots. Would you like to save and end the session? Amscoots
[11699.88s -> 11708.78s]  gave 20 essentially. Oh my God. What started this? 20 from Amscoots, which is a huge amount. And then
[11708.78s -> 11717.35s]  La Cranda gave 10. I gave like 500. No, I didn't give 500. It was almost going to be like 500 or
[11717.35s -> 11726.02s]  something. I was doubling nothing over and over again. Thank you everybody. 20 from Amscoots,
[11726.02s -> 11748.01s]  10 from La Cranda. Holy shit. Thank you. Much love to you all. Let's feed the fish. So as long as I
[11748.01s -> 11759.78s]  leave one of these in here, right, then I'll be fine. I want to make sure that that's very well.
[11760.10s -> 11769.19s]  Like, no, I need more in there. More. Oh, no, no, you're talking about the subs. Spergiltron.
[11769.19s -> 11783.99s]  Spergiltron, thank you for the five community subs. Must have food. Another five. Now. Oh,
[11783.99s -> 11789.88s]  yummy, bitty goodness. How do any of the people in this chat know how to play this game?
[11790.60s -> 11794.60s]  That's a really good question. A wiki. People have the wiki open maybe. I wouldn't be surprised.
[11794.60s -> 11806.92s]  Another five community subs. Exifer. Hello. Thank you, Exifer, for the five community subs.
[11806.92s -> 11821.53s]  Is anyone out there? I'm right here. I'm right here. Hello. Hi there. Let's talk. Hey, Greg.
[11822.33s -> 11837.82s]  You have a bloody nose. Greg, let's talk. No. What's up? I was wondering, are you married?
[11838.78s -> 11850.76s]  No. You're unmarried? Yes. Really? Hey, that's okay. Don't listen to people who say you need to
[11850.76s -> 11859.48s]  get married. It's an antiquated notion, really. What a smart fish. You want to be to lower the
[11859.48s -> 11863.48s]  oxygen to make his brain IQ have a problem? No. Moo means moo, by the way. Moo, thanks for the
[11863.48s -> 11869.56s]  five community subs. All right, so you don't have to get married for what? You're not gonna get
[11869.64s -> 11884.55s]  married? Let's talk about politics. What are all your political positions? You know it.
[11892.89s -> 11912.58s]  Politics. Politics. This better be good. I will name you. Yes. I will name you. Do you want a name?
[11915.08s -> 11920.68s]  Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name. Finally. When you've decided what you want to call me,
[11921.32s -> 11929.50s]  I'm ready. I'm ready. All right, then. Here's how to do it. You're going to say my new name
[11929.50s -> 11945.48s]  three times. Each time I say now, say the name once. Got it? Got it. Now. Garfield. One more time.
[11946.60s -> 11956.55s]  Garfield. One more time. Garfield. Okay, I'll remember that. Next time you want to call me,
[11956.55s -> 11963.43s]  using that name. And don't forget the name you gave me. Because if you do, I'm not going to
[11963.43s -> 11970.07s]  tell you what it is. And there it is. Would you like to save and end the session? I gotta go like
[11970.07s -> 12124.44s]  wash my mouth. This is like a used microphone. I just put it in my mouth like deep. I don't
[12124.44s -> 12129.56s]  fuck around with that shit, guys. Somebody could have shoved that up their ass. You know what I
[12129.56s -> 12139.86s]  mean? Can I reliably say that somebody didn't shove this up their ass? I don't know. I'd like
[12139.86s -> 12152.94s]  to say no. It's absolutely not. But can you be sure? I don't know people are fucking crazy. I
[12152.94s -> 12163.02s]  don't know. I have to go see a doctor now? No, I just like rinsed my mouth with like toothpaste
[12164.09s -> 12169.53s]  and water. I took like I squeezed some toothpaste on my finger and like mushed it into my mouth
[12169.53s -> 12175.93s]  and like smeared it all around my teeth and like chewed it up and then like swished around and then
[12175.93s -> 12186.76s]  spit it out. On second thought, why didn't I just use a toothbrush? All right, sea man, let's go.
[12187.40s -> 12204.07s]  So this is Garfield. Hey Garfield. I'm not ignoring you. I'm thinking. I put another mic in my mouth.
[12204.07s -> 12211.91s]  That wasn't a used microphone. Tell me something. Do you like girls? Yes. Then do you have a girlfriend?
[12213.56s -> 12232.23s]  Yes. You do have a girlfriend? Yes. I'm not surprised you stood. Okay. Okay. Anything else?
[12235.82s -> 12243.35s]  What? See, he likes me. He thinks I'm cool.
[12245.99s -> 12250.15s]  This is the dumb one. No, it's not. This is the golden one. The golden one's the smart one.
[12250.15s -> 12267.78s]  This is Greg. Oh, fuck. Wait, now they're both golden. Greg. Hey, Greg. I'm thinking. What's
[12267.78s -> 12278.66s]  going on, Greg? What's new? He called. Yeah, he did call me a virgin like 30 minutes ago. He did.
[12280.41s -> 12295.13s]  Yes. Let's talk. Since you have a girlfriend, let me ask you. Are you two living together? Yes.
[12296.46s -> 12306.31s]  Really? You live with your girlfriend? Yes. Hey, good for you. Just remember, she's not your mom.
[12306.95s -> 12309.99s]  It's not her job to clean up your messes when you're a slob.
[12313.19s -> 12322.66s]  You don't think I know that? I know. What? So what month is your sweetie's birthday in?
[12325.53s -> 12335.42s]  April. April? Yes. An April fool, huh? Feel free to use that joke if you'd like.
[12335.42s -> 12354.94s]  The fuck did you say? Throw a fucking drink at him. That would be a very gross overreaction,
[12354.94s -> 12364.46s]  by the way. Oh, April, huh? But she's an April fool. Then she, shut the fuck up. You'd be like,
[12364.46s -> 12379.26s]  whoa, dude, you gotta calm down. So. Word. Word. So what day is your honey's birthday on?
[12385.14s -> 12394.23s]  Nine. The ninth? Yes. That's so sweet that you remember. I actually don't. I don't know.
[12400.66s -> 12403.99s]  Of course I know what my fucking girlfriend's birthday is, guys.
[12405.13s -> 12421.54s]  I'm doing it for the fish. I'm fucking with the fish. So, anything else? Word. Word. Word. Shut up.
[12422.66s -> 12428.86s]  You shut up. No problem. I'm just kidding, talk to me more. This is the whole video game,
[12428.86s -> 12448.38s]  I need to talk to you. Let's talk. Hey. Hey yourself. Let's talk. Let's talk. Well,
[12448.46s -> 12460.14s]  you're not just going to shit the bed, are we good? How are we doing? I think we're good.
[12462.33s -> 12475.26s]  Let's talk. I'm mad at you. I think I can. I think I can. Don't be mad. Don't be mad.
[12483.27s -> 12488.74s]  Don't make me laugh. You can't be mad. A pee if you don't stop.
[12490.98s -> 12496.98s]  Quit it. Quit it. It hurts. Are we cool? Garfield, are we cool?
[12498.55s -> 12511.18s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get some rest then. Let's talk. So I figured a couple things out,
[12511.18s -> 12518.30s]  matchmaker that I am. Your self-being a Virgo and your partner an Ares, no doubt the beginning of
[12518.30s -> 12523.42s]  your relationship was rather tough as you took time to learn where each person was coming from.
[12524.38s -> 12530.62s]  Ares tend to rush into things, whereas your Virgo personality will spend more time planning.
[12531.26s -> 12535.58s]  Don't be discouraged though, as there are many things you can learn from one another.
[12536.46s -> 12543.02s]  For example, you can teach your Ares patience and your sweetheart can help you cut loose a bit.
[12543.74s -> 12550.06s]  Live a little on the spontaneous edge. Just be aware that your Ares friend may be rather sensitive
[12550.06s -> 12557.66s]  of your criticisms at times and the two of you should be fine. So there, that'll be five dollars.
[12557.66s -> 12568.68s]  That was just vague enough to be real and just real enough for me to care.
[12570.12s -> 12596.33s]  Here's your five dollars. You hungry? No thanks. Let's talk. So listen,
[12597.21s -> 12606.97s]  do you have any kids? Yes, seven. No. So you don't have any kids right now, is that correct?
[12607.93s -> 12616.49s]  No. No. Wait. No. Wait. Wait. He didn't leave. He fucking daffy ducked me. He did like the Looney Tunes thing. No.
[12622.49s -> 12629.62s]  Yes. He daffy ducked me. He fucking like duck season, rabbit season, duck season, rabbit season.
[12629.62s -> 12633.54s]  I got rabbits. I don't even know what the fuck he said. Kids in the future? No.
[12638.50s -> 12649.54s]  I don't like how much information they're getting. Thank god there's no internet because this was a
[12649.54s -> 12654.18s]  game now. Everything you ever say to will get uploaded to a fucking data server and then they
[12654.18s -> 12665.22s]  would start selling it. Thank god this shit don't work now. I guess like this is Siri is the closest
[12665.22s -> 12669.14s]  thing. You don't think they're fucking putting that data somewhere in a fridge and keeping it nice and
[12669.14s -> 12678.68s]  cold? I disable Siri, man. I don't want that shit. You think I want Siri? Like Siri's always just
[12678.68s -> 12684.86s]  listening. How many times have you had like a loud ass diarrhea and you want like Siri to hear that
[12684.86s -> 12703.34s]  and get sent to fucking Apple? Are you kidding me? You stream on the internet? Yeah. But I don't,
[12703.34s -> 12710.17s]  I'm not streaming in my bathroom. I'm not like lying in my bed at two o'clock in the morning
[12710.17s -> 12722.20s]  like this on my iPad streaming under like the covers. What? Let's chat. Garfield.
[12723.16s -> 12746.17s]  Hey Garfield. What's up? Let's talk. I don't want to talk. I'm getting ignored. So tell me,
[12747.05s -> 12759.78s]  how is your father's health? See they want this data. He's fine. He's okay then? Yeah. I thought
[12759.78s -> 12772.01s]  you said he was okay. Is he or not? Yes. He's okay then? Yes. Good. I'm glad to hear he's doing well.
[12772.01s -> 12780.06s]  Is that like a idle mafia threat? You're gonna ask for like protection money in a few minutes?
[12780.94s -> 12796.44s]  Or how the bugs? I still, what is this now? This is like a cocoon. Can I talk to this? Hello?
[12797.16s -> 12813.30s]  What is this thing turning into? I got one more of these. Yeah, they have a face. Is that gonna
[12813.30s -> 12824.36s]  turn into a, that's like kind of freaking me out. All right, whatever. Let's heat it up a little bit
[12824.36s -> 12838.02s]  more. Can I tap it? I don't think I want to. Hey Greg. Greg? Okay, just be sure to save some
[12838.02s -> 12851.91s]  for later. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's talk. Hey.
[12859.38s -> 12868.25s]  Call your dad right now and make sure he's okay. Oh, how's your father? Father's fine.
[12868.25s -> 12875.93s]  Oh, that's good to hear that your father is doing well. And there's like a long violin
[12875.93s -> 12888.09s]  horror sound. That like? I pick up the phone. I drop the phone like three times. I drop it again.
[12888.65s -> 12907.88s]  Dad? Dad? Dad? No answer. Let's talk. Let's talk. Is your father still working?
[12908.84s -> 12920.10s]  No. He's taking it easy, is he? Yes. Well, he's retired. He deserves a rest after all those years
[12920.10s -> 12925.38s]  of supporting your family. Actually, call him. You know, unless he was a deadbeat who never gave you
[12925.38s -> 12934.52s]  a dime. In which case he should be forced to work 80 hours a week hard labor. That's pretty dark.
[12935.32s -> 12949.05s]  Hmm. I'll try you again later. Let's talk. So, what month is your dad's birthday? Jesus, what the
[12949.05s -> 12966.60s]  fuck is with the birthdays? December. Hello. What month was your dad born in? December. He was born
[12966.60s -> 12976.15s]  in December? Yes. Yes. Interesting. The fathers of most people I know were born in December.
[12976.15s -> 12992.92s]  That's weird. Would you like to know the day? What? He knows your dad. So, what day is your dad's
[12992.92s -> 13006.20s]  birthday? 25th. The 25th? No. All right. Let's try that again, mush mouth. On what day was your dad born?
[13006.20s -> 13019.59s]  Mush mouth? 16th. The 16th? Yes. I'll remember that. Your father's birthday is important, you know.
[13020.15s -> 13025.35s]  But if you ask me, the most important thing is that your dad knows how much he means to you.
[13026.46s -> 13032.62s]  Unless you think he's a huge pain in the neck. I'd probably keep that to myself if I were you.
[13035.78s -> 13041.78s]  What are you gonna do to my dad? What are you gonna do to my dad? What are you gonna
[13041.78s -> 13049.91s]  do to my dad? Let me go. I'm just kidding. Maybe you should take a nap.
[13057.94s -> 13075.46s]  Quit it. Quit it. It hurts. Let's talk. Who wants to talk? Any news? Any news? Not much.
[13076.42s -> 13097.99s]  The fish have... What are you talking about? Anyone have any news? Garfield. I'm great. Thanks.
[13097.99s -> 13112.22s]  Let's talk. Let's talk. Is your mother in good health? Yes. She's doing well? Yes. That's certainly
[13112.22s -> 13129.66s]  good to hear. Thank you. Let's talk. When's your mother's birthday? So, tell me. Does your mother
[13129.66s -> 13140.02s]  work? No. She doesn't work. Is that right? No. Well, I bet she works hard enough without an actual
[13140.02s -> 13148.20s]  job. Being a mom is hard work, you know. And giving birth? Ugh. Let me tell you. I'd rather be eaten
[13148.20s -> 13154.84s]  by a shark than go through that. Not that I have any choice in the matter. The age group for this
[13154.84s -> 13165.70s]  game is for probably teens and early 20s. Not for old fucks like me. Let's talk. He wants the birthdays.
[13165.70s -> 13169.38s]  He wants their health reports. He wants the medical records. What month was your mother born?
[13171.48s -> 13181.62s]  August. She was born in August? Yes. My knowledge of you and your family grows ever more complete.
[13185.93s -> 13196.82s]  Let's talk. What day is your mother's birthday on? 20. I'm not familiar with that date. I said 20.
[13196.82s -> 13208.30s]  Do you have your own special calendar? Let's try it again. 20. The 20th? Yes. Of course.
[13209.26s -> 13216.30s]  It's all becoming clear. I think mothers are great. I hope you know how lucky you are to
[13216.30s -> 13220.70s]  have a mom. I'm gonna go downstairs for a break. You wouldn't want to end up like me. Forced to
[13220.70s -> 13227.24s]  depend on complete strangers for food and attention. He's gonna find where I am. He's gonna know my
[13227.24s -> 13238.06s]  mother's information, my father's information. He's gonna be holding a fucking knife. Put down
[13238.06s -> 13251.56s]  the knife. Put down the knife. Let's talk. You done? Is your significant other in the
[13251.56s -> 13263.26s]  room right now? No. Is there anyone else in the room besides you? Technically, yes.
[13264.82s -> 13291.00s]  There's like 6,000 people. Yes. Oh. Never mind. Let's talk. Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow.
[13291.00s -> 13298.92s]  Okay. They've eaten. Let's make sure they're comfortable. What if there wasn't somebody
[13298.92s -> 13312.71s]  else in the room? What would he have said? It's kind of creepy. Actual murderer. I'm in danger.
[13320.14s -> 13338.63s]  We'll never know. 19.5. Looks good. Put the air up. Put the light. Let's go make sure we're sprayed.
[13342.46s -> 13347.74s]  Up at 100. So we have one. Here's the thing though. We have one. I got two pellets.
[13350.70s -> 13357.26s]  I have one bug and then one cocoon. The question is, should I just feed the pellets and let these
[13357.98s -> 13366.20s]  turn into seeds? You know what I'm saying? I'm just gonna use the pellets tomorrow.
[13366.20s -> 13371.51s]  I destroyed that egg. It was not. That was a bonehead move. It really was.
[13372.39s -> 13393.91s]  All right. Let's go. Would you like to... Tomorrow. Fast forward the clock. Now he asks if you're
[13393.91s -> 13408.36s]  like cheating on your girlfriend. I'm telling you. That's why. Shit. I forgot to fucking
[13408.36s -> 13423.61s]  mute the screen. Sorry. We did get a lot of talking though. 19th at just like a day later.
[13427.18s -> 13446.81s]  Close it up. Lots of personal info. Telling me doesn't exist. I'll try that.
[13452.41s -> 13462.94s]  The Dreamcast was really cool. Yeah. It was a very interesting system. Who should we call
[13462.94s -> 13474.58s]  if you were missing tomorrow? I don't know, buddy. They tried shit. Yeah, they did try shit.
[13476.50s -> 13483.86s]  Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Let's get some info. Greetings and welcome back.
[13484.66s -> 13493.46s]  You're doing a good job. First, a recap of your previous visit. Do I have any tattoos? No. None.
[13496.60s -> 13505.78s]  At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men. They are suffering from the cold.
[13506.42s -> 13512.47s]  Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level. Would you ever get a
[13512.47s -> 13516.87s]  drunk tattoo? Allow me to give you the highlights for today. Would you ever get a tattoo? No. Not
[13516.87s -> 13523.35s]  anymore. If Professor Gasset's data is accurate, we can expect a change in the gill man's body
[13523.35s -> 13528.15s]  very shortly. A change. So let us head over to the tank. We're gonna get an evolution here, I think.
[13529.27s -> 13538.17s]  Is Seaman gonna be Landman? I told you about the tattoo that I was gonna get when I was like 21.
[13539.29s -> 13546.92s]  I was gonna get the venom symbol right here. The venom. Good thing it didn't go through with that
[13546.92s -> 13571.42s]  one. I thought, I think it would be pretty cool. Remember, I was also like, I was also fit. So that
[13571.42s -> 13576.94s]  would have looked cool, right? Remember, I had like a fucking stacked up body. Somebody's dead. No.
[13584.89s -> 13595.02s]  It's about time. Another day. You want everyone to know that you're going to the bathroom. Yay.
[13595.02s -> 13603.30s]  Well, they do. They know now. Took you long enough. Hey, how about turning up the air in here?
[13604.10s -> 13611.59s]  Let me make sure I didn't go too far. Come on. It's like the wheel on Wheel of Fortune. Stop.
[13614.01s -> 13622.98s]  Thought I was definitely going to suffocate for a minute there. Having the venom symbol on your arm
[13622.98s -> 13644.57s]  would be the equivalent of wearing a monster energy hat. Hey you. Is anyone out there?
[13645.21s -> 13656.18s]  Wear a tap out shirt. Hey. Good evening. Does it evolve? Good evening.
[13658.26s -> 13666.42s]  Let's talk. Do you see any differences? I have another question for you and it's a serious one,
[13666.42s -> 13675.93s]  so no fooling around. Do you like yourself? I'll be honest. Yeah. You do like yourself?
[13676.81s -> 13686.31s]  Yes. Yes. I'll bet you like yourself. In fact, I'd guess you like yourself at least twice a day.
[13687.03s -> 13697.11s]  But seriously, there's nothing wrong with liking yourself. I like you too. Something's going on
[13697.11s -> 13710.10s]  here. Does this imply that, that's no, he's really just totally incorrect. Let's talk. Let's talk.
[13714.06s -> 13722.71s]  So what's the one thing you like most about yourself? Fucking loaded question.
[13729.85s -> 13736.97s]  What do you say? Let me ask this again and this time I'd appreciate an answer.
[13737.93s -> 13743.61s]  Okay. So what's the one thing you like most about yourself?
[13744.57s -> 13757.42s]  My intuition. Let's try that again. What do you like most about yourself and enunciate
[13758.38s -> 13771.13s]  this time? Sense of humor. Sense of humor. You like your looks? Yeah. Well, I like your looks too,
[13772.33s -> 13779.29s]  except for when you give me that one dirty one. What physical feature in particular do you like
[13779.29s -> 13803.67s]  the best? My teeth. Hey, why all the noise? My chin. My chin. Chin. Are you trying to break my
[13805.13s -> 13816.26s]  thing that allows me to hear? Come on, stay with me here. I said, so what's the one thing you like
[13816.26s -> 13827.69s]  most about yourself? Chin. Your chin? Yes. I have to say I've never noticed anyone with a particularly
[13827.69s -> 13848.62s]  exquisite chin before. Well, I mean, that is until now, of course. Where, what are we doing? Yes.
[13849.94s -> 13860.70s]  It'll cost you a buck. Let's talk. I know you said you like yourself and that's great,
[13860.70s -> 13868.22s]  but I mean, you're not perfect. Nobody is except maybe me. What's my biggest flaw? There's got to
[13868.22s -> 13875.74s]  be something you don't like about yourself. So if you had to pick the one thing that you dislike
[13875.74s -> 13892.55s]  most about yourself, what would it be? Hey, when somebody asks you a question, you answer it.
[13893.43s -> 13901.83s]  So are you up to answering my question now? What I wanted to know was, I know you said you like
[13901.83s -> 13911.19s]  yourself and that's great, but I mean, you're not perfect. Nobody is except maybe me. There's got to
[13911.19s -> 13918.71s]  be something you don't like about yourself. So if you had to pick the one thing that you dislike
[13918.71s -> 13930.78s]  most about yourself, what would it be? Your height? Well, as long as your body's long enough
[13930.78s -> 13957.83s]  to reach the floor, you should be fine. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's talk. So it's interesting
[13957.83s -> 13963.43s]  that when I asked you what you liked best about yourself, you picked a physical feature. I mean,
[13963.43s -> 13969.83s]  you could have said personality or intelligence or a variety of other emotional or intellectual
[13969.83s -> 13976.63s]  attributes. Fake words. So in general, do you think that you are attractive? Oh my god, this is
[13976.63s -> 13985.00s]  like fucking with me here. I don't know. Sometimes maybe. Yes. You do. Sometimes I look in the mirror
[13985.00s -> 13988.76s]  and I look like shit and I hate it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I go, I think I look all
[13988.76s -> 13996.52s]  right. Yes. That's good. Usually if you believe that you are attractive, other people will think
[13996.60s -> 14001.80s]  so too. What do you guys think? Because at the very least, they will be attracted to your
[14001.80s -> 14019.90s]  self-confidence. Okay, what do you guys think? People are gonna screenshot that and I look like
[14021.67s -> 14035.02s]  fucking crazed. Let's talk. So you think you're at least somewhat attractive. Well, do you think
[14035.10s -> 14052.34s]  other people find you attractive? Do you guys think I'm attractive? What? What? I can't hear you.
[14053.06s -> 14060.34s]  You know, let us revisit my last inquiry to you. That is, if you can cooperate this time.
[14061.94s -> 14069.86s]  So you think you're at least somewhat attractive. Well, do you think other people find you attractive?
[14070.58s -> 14082.38s]  Yes. So you do think people find you attractive? Yes. It's great that you think so highly of yourself.
[14083.02s -> 14089.02s]  Just be careful that your head doesn't get too big. Otherwise you'll never be able to buy a hat
[14089.02s -> 14101.77s]  again. I have a small head. Anything else? Let's talk. There's nothing I want to talk about right now.
[14102.65s -> 14113.10s]  What do you think of yourself? No, leave me alone. What is your best trait?
[14115.02s -> 14124.86s]  What? So not too long ago, I asked you if you liked yourself. Now I have a slightly different
[14124.86s -> 14134.97s]  question for you. Do you think other people like you? Yes. You do think people like you?
[14135.93s -> 14142.49s]  Yes. Well, that's good. You like yourself and you think other people like you.
[14143.05s -> 14145.85s]  That sounds pretty healthy. How are you going to turn this around on me?
[14146.49s -> 14161.14s]  You don't exist. You don't exist. How's that for a brain buster? Put this tongue in that mouth.
[14161.86s -> 14175.56s]  Dream on. You are a video game. Right, I know. You're not real. What do you want?
[14175.56s -> 14189.00s]  You aren't real. You are not real. Right, I know. You are operating on the Sega Dreamcast.
[14192.84s -> 14204.70s]  Everything is fine. Let's talk. We've been talking a lot about how you see yourself and how
[14204.70s -> 14212.86s]  other people see you. Now let me ask you this. Have you ever seen yourself on TV or on video?
[14213.82s -> 14222.66s]  Yes. So I guess you know then that the rumor about the camera adding 10 pounds isn't true.
[14223.22s -> 14231.54s]  It adds at least 20 and a couple of unsightly fins. It can be weird seeing yourself on video.
[14232.26s -> 14241.59s]  Were you surprised by the way you looked? No. Well then I guess you are just very comfortable
[14241.67s -> 14248.95s]  with seeing your naked body in all those positions. Oh wait, maybe you haven't seen that video yet.
[14250.39s -> 14261.43s]  You got tapes of me naked? Is that what he's trying to say?
[14266.55s -> 14279.37s]  You're going to jail. What do you want? You are going to jail. You're going to jail.
[14281.30s -> 14290.95s]  What do you want? You are going to jail. Let's talk. So you said you liked yourself. What is
[14290.95s -> 14295.59s]  with this whole self thing? You think other people like you. You think you're attractive
[14295.59s -> 14299.11s]  and you think other people find you attractive. All right well when you put it like that I sound
[14299.11s -> 14303.59s]  like a fucking narcissist. I'd say it seems like you have a lot of self-confidence and a positive
[14303.59s -> 14313.03s]  self-image. Would you agree? Sometimes, yeah. That's great but don't get too big of a head.
[14313.03s -> 14319.43s]  Otherwise. It'll make your body look funny. Hold on I gotta like take care of the other animals.
[14319.51s -> 14338.73s]  What the fuck is that thing? What do we do with the moth? Can I talk to the moth? Hello? Hello?
[14339.45s -> 14353.51s]  I hate this thing. I hate this thing. Hello? I can't even fucking. No I don't want to look
[14353.51s -> 14366.28s]  at this. This thing's fucking freaking me out. Another moth coming up. Smash it. Kill it. I'm
[14366.28s -> 14375.26s]  not going to kill it. Feed it. Do you have to feed this thing pellets? No, no. This thing.
[14376.22s -> 14384.98s]  No you don't have to feed that thing. Just make sure the spray is there and I'm going to feed
[14384.98s -> 14411.37s]  the pellets to these two. Oh yummy baity goodness. Can we eat claymation, streamer? I think that's all
[14411.37s -> 14418.65s]  that they're going to get for today. Tasty. Although you need food too. You also need to eat.
[14419.53s -> 14424.71s]  I'm out of food though. This is kind of the last bit of food I have for the two of them.
[14424.79s -> 14443.35s]  Can just one of them die? Hey thanks. How are you today? What? Tasty. Are you human?
[14445.30s -> 14462.54s]  What's the meaning of life? Eh? What's the point? As if you care. Give me the secret. Since I don't
[14462.54s -> 14470.14s]  have anything else to add, I'll be going now. Goodbye. Are you going to get legs or something
[14470.14s -> 14478.87s]  here soon? This might be ugly. You may want to look away. No let's zoom the fuck in. Evolve? No
[14478.87s -> 14490.22s]  let's just poo. Look at those little legs. See the little legs on the side? Someone talk to me.
[14492.79s -> 14510.95s]  What's up? Do you think you're attractive? What? Do you think I'm attractive?
[14512.76s -> 14525.46s]  Do you think I'm good looking? Hello? Am I attractive? Let's talk. No not today. Maybe tomorrow.
[14527.27s -> 14539.91s]  Skip ahead a few hours? Will you evolve? You're not so bad looking yourself. Thank you. Finally
[14539.91s -> 14558.15s]  I got the answer I was looking for. What are your fears? Are you afraid of anything? Amazing.
[14559.03s -> 14577.93s]  Well yes I guess so. Are you afraid? What do you fear most? Is this better? Goodbye. Have a good
[14577.93s -> 14587.00s]  night. Good night. Uh I think I'm gonna skip an hour or two. What time is it right now in the game?
[14587.96s -> 14592.25s]  Would you like to save and end the session? To skip till tomorrow?
[14593.05s -> 14615.88s]  To skip a day? Only go an hour or two. Yeah I'll go a day. Like not a full day.
[14616.60s -> 14647.08s]  I love cheating in old video games. So 319 at 47. We're gonna do 319 at like three four hours later?
[14647.08s -> 14661.83s]  Like maybe three hours? Two hours? I'm gonna say two hours. Not a whole day. Three hours.
[14663.56s -> 14673.58s]  Is your father working? I already gave you that answer. 12. 12. 12. You know a lot of 12s.
[14674.14s -> 14700.25s]  Let's just go there. We'll go there. Like 8, 10. Let's see what we got. Oh yeah. Blood type. I don't
[14700.25s -> 14717.50s]  even know what my blood type is. That was some weird like video game physics engine bullshit.
[14721.86s -> 14724.82s]  I just picked it up. I didn't do it. There's nothing in there. I don't know why I keep trying
[14724.82s -> 14742.55s]  to sip out of it. Here we go. This is your second visit today. It is good to have you back so soon.
[14743.19s -> 14753.53s]  Let's see. Last time did you notice the Gill man has begun to sprout legs? I did see the little
[14753.53s -> 14760.57s]  one. Preparing for the next step in his evolution. Land. However this tank holds only water at the
[14760.57s -> 14768.54s]  moment. Changes must be made to facilitate their new appendages. Also with the addition of legs,
[14769.18s -> 14775.82s]  this creature can no longer be referred to as Gill man. Rather he'll be referred to as podfish
[14775.82s -> 14783.86s]  from this point forward. Podfish. Did you see the moth emerge from the cocoon? I did. It is quite
[14783.86s -> 14794.70s]  amazing. If you missed it, watch your next pupa carefully. Vodfish. At the moment the habitat
[14794.70s -> 14804.78s]  contains two podfish. They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the
[14804.78s -> 14814.34s]  temperature to a more comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank. Let's see how these
[14814.34s -> 14836.57s]  podfish are doing. Don't break that. You're gonna need it. So I'll be honest, I've never seen or
[14836.57s -> 14844.17s]  heard anything about this game other than the fish. I owned this game when I was a teenager
[14844.17s -> 14848.41s]  and I think I told you I got maybe 10 minutes in and said hello and then turned it off because I
[14848.41s -> 14854.57s]  didn't get it. I don't even know what possibly could happen. They actually have legs now.
[14854.57s -> 14881.59s]  That's scary. Oh goody. Yay. That's weird. That is very odd. Yeah that's weird. Let's take a look
[14881.59s -> 14903.38s]  over here. Uh oh. Where's the food? I don't have any food. There's an egg here. I see one egg. I
[14903.38s -> 14921.78s]  don't see any. Are they gonna die? Because right now this, I have maybe, it says two days and they
[14921.78s -> 14932.06s]  die right? The moth is food. I don't think I should do that yet. I'm gonna wait till tomorrow.
[14933.13s -> 14942.18s]  It's still the same day technically so they're good. You know I could really eat. Fuck. Hey.
[14943.74s -> 14960.79s]  Leave me alone. Let's talk. I like your new legs. What are you doing? Cool legs. Nice new legs.
[14961.67s -> 14978.84s]  I like the legs. Let's talk. Let's talk. Yes. You loading up on an answer? Let's talk. He's pissed.
[14979.40s -> 14989.98s]  What's the matter? I'm a little hungry. We're gonna have to fast forward today. They're not gonna be
[14989.98s -> 14998.89s]  dead right? Let's talk. Let's talk. There's nothing I want to talk about right now.
[14999.05s -> 15010.58s]  Now let's have a conversation. Don't repeat. It makes them mad. Well look here.
[15011.38s -> 15015.94s]  The reason why I'm repeating it is because see the little thing in the middle? When you hold a down
[15016.74s -> 15020.82s]  and you say something, that will change to tell you if they even heard it or not.
[15021.54s -> 15028.34s]  So when I talk, let's say I go let's talk and it doesn't change. I'm only waiting for it to change
[15028.42s -> 15036.52s]  and then someone over here wants to eat. All right I'm gonna have to go one day.
[15037.88s -> 15062.42s]  Is it chow time yet? Let's wait a few hours. Add land. How am I supposed to add land?
[15065.88s -> 15069.72s]  Oh I was looking at chat. We're fine. It's a little hoppy. That'll be fine.
[15071.75s -> 15082.55s]  I have no way to add land. All right this one's about to come out. All right I got two moths now
[15082.55s -> 15086.71s]  which means there's an egg here. I don't want to kill one of the moths because that's how that's
[15086.71s -> 15099.67s]  how they produce eggs. I'm gonna have to fast forward like three or four hours. I think I need
[15099.67s -> 15122.38s]  some food. Shit. I will feed you later. We're gonna fast forward. Let's go. Would you like to save and
[15122.38s -> 15135.34s]  end the session? We're gonna go like six more hours. Ask them for food. No land happens
[15135.34s -> 15147.77s]  automatically. I can't add it. Get some food. It'll cost you a buck. Produce food. No no we
[15147.77s -> 15156.71s]  gotta fast forward. Would you like to save? We're gonna go like six hours, seven hours ahead
[15157.43s -> 15176.76s]  because then it'll be one day. I hope they're not dead. Oh fuck. What do you think like 10 hours?
[15179.27s -> 15193.50s]  I'm saying probably six to ten. Why is a blue screen such a big deal? Because it's very bright
[15193.50s -> 15196.78s]  and if people have a full screen it's like incredibly jarring because I have a full screen
[15196.78s -> 15215.93s]  here and it hurts. I'll go four hours ahead see what happens. This is your third day coming back.
[15215.93s -> 15237.91s]  You are addicted. Please feed us. Why did Leonard Nimoy do this game? Who published it?
[15238.79s -> 15245.21s]  Um I think this was this was like a launch game for Sega Dreamcast wasn't it? This is no this is
[15245.21s -> 15268.68s]  a Sega game. This is produced and developed by Sega. It's like a first party title I think. I
[15268.68s -> 15287.08s]  should change it by like 10 minutes and come back like 15 times. Good. Good. Still alive.
[15293.13s -> 15309.85s]  Can I just get rid of one of the sea men? Screen show. Oh fuck. He said that I need to feed them
[15309.85s -> 15317.48s]  immediately. I'm sorry. I want to get rid of one of them. Like that's just too much to feed two.
[15321.72s -> 15326.60s]  He said that their legs are developed and they're hungry and to feed them immediately.
[15332.23s -> 15342.07s]  Damn it. I'm gonna have to right? Is it a larva? No it's just two of those eggs.
[15342.07s -> 15351.05s]  How long does it take for an egg to hatch? How long does it take for a little larva egg to hatch?
[15353.42s -> 15361.86s]  An hour? Should I just go back and do it an hour? Feed the moth? I there you don't feed the moths.
[15362.87s -> 15368.14s]  You can feed the moth now? Feed them what? Feed the moth? Well I don't have any food.
[15369.02s -> 15378.57s]  Oh feed you mean talk about feed them one of these moths because here's an egg that'll hatch
[15379.69s -> 15391.42s]  and then I got two of these. Is this a bad idea? I don't know if this is a good idea.
[15392.14s -> 15396.97s]  This is what's it despite there's a spider in here. What the fuck is this spider? What do I do
[15396.97s -> 15409.30s]  about the spider? What's a spider? What is the spider? I can I can eat this one. Kill it. I can't
[15409.30s -> 15426.68s]  kill it. I don't need to kill the moth now. Spider is food. Oh can I? Is it poisonous? It's a poisonous
[15426.68s -> 15442.94s]  spider. I have a larva though right now. We're good. I don't need to kill. Should I throw this away?
[15443.74s -> 15470.87s]  Flick the spider. Flick spider. I'm trying. I can't flick the spider. Spider eats the bugs. Flicker.
[15470.87s -> 15493.94s]  I... Would you like to save and end the session? I'll do it. No one's ever written anything about
[15493.94s -> 15505.40s]  this. Ctrl-F spider. Also note that all living things in the insect cage can be picked up and
[15505.40s -> 15510.68s]  either fed to the semen in your tank or stored in the storage matrix. I often find it useful
[15510.68s -> 15514.60s]  to keep a larva or two in the storage matrix in case you're having trouble getting moths to lay
[15514.60s -> 15522.12s]  eggs in the cage. Often because they are being killed by a spider. Speaking of which, occasionally
[15522.12s -> 15527.72s]  a kimoth egg will hatch into a spider. Although this seems highly unlikely, it does happen. So
[15527.72s -> 15533.88s]  we got a rare spawn here. If you feed a spider to you semen it will become sick. When this happens
[15533.88s -> 15540.36s]  you must spend a couple of days saying kind things to the sick semen. Like get well soon or I love
[15540.36s -> 15546.92s]  you. Cheesy I know, but it's better than having your semen die. Okay. Another annoying thing about
[15546.92s -> 15552.28s]  spiders is that if they are left in the cage long enough they will spin a web that your kimoths can
[15552.28s -> 15557.40s]  get caught in. If a kimoth is caught in the web it cannot escape unless you grab it and then drop
[15557.40s -> 15563.08s]  it back in the cage. The spider will kill it if it's in the web long enough. Since you cannot store
[15563.08s -> 15567.64s]  spiders in the storage matrix, the only way to get rid of them is to drop them in with your semen
[15568.20s -> 15572.68s]  after you've fed your semen. By the way we have to get the rare fucking spawn.
[15573.98s -> 15578.62s]  Since semen always ignore any food dropped in its cage after it has eaten they will not eat the
[15578.62s -> 15585.58s]  spider. The spider is also harmless to your semen and you should not worry about it being with them
[15585.58s -> 15603.62s]  as long as they have already eaten. Okay. So feed them the larva, feed Greg the real food,
[15603.62s -> 15611.19s]  and then feed Garfield the spider. That was a really fucked up strange laugh and I even saw
[15611.19s -> 15635.46s]  on the preview how fucking weird I looked. Okay here we go. Pick it up. Dude pick up the fucking
[15635.46s -> 15657.29s]  larva. Okay here we go. Which one of them is Garfield? I don't know. Whoever gets it first
[15657.29s -> 15664.89s]  lives. Oh good. You get to live. I don't even know who you are. Fucking he got it. God damn it. All
[15664.89s -> 15677.29s]  right now they've both eaten. Where's the spider? God this thing's terrifying. They've both eaten.
[15679.56s -> 15685.24s]  So now I can drop this in here and they won't eat it. That's what the game facts from like 1998
[15685.24s -> 15701.18s]  said. Don't eat that. Why are you doing this? Don't eat that. You just ate. Okay was this going to
[15701.18s -> 15714.25s]  drown? Don't eat it. Don't eat it. All right everything's good. I still have the two moths.
[15714.89s -> 15724.31s]  Perfect. Now they've both eaten and we're good to go. We're still surviving. Good. Now I have a
[15724.31s -> 15729.90s]  question. Does the spider stay in the tank forever until somebody eats it or will it just drown?
[15734.50s -> 15759.96s]  I don't see it. Hello. Get arms. Hi. Hey Greg. Greg. Greg. Hello. Come on let me talk to him.
[15762.46s -> 15774.76s]  Greg. The fuck are you doing? Hello. Garfield. I'm not even getting an indicator that they're
[15774.76s -> 15792.44s]  hearing me. Greg. Hello. Hello. Hello. No they're not even paying attention. Snap out of it. Let's
[15792.44s -> 15799.72s]  go. We have conversations to have. Let the mating begin. What do you mean let the mating begin?
[15800.76s -> 15808.39s]  You're not gonna like do two brothers and there's not they're not doing this right? Hey this isn't
[15808.39s -> 15849.90s]  the spice channel. Turn around. Why is this happening? Why would you have? How long are you guys
[15849.90s -> 15873.66s]  gonna do it for? I okay. Who's your daddy? Why is he dead? He fucked to death. What? He had sex to a
[15873.66s -> 15893.22s]  point where he died. He had a heart attack during sex. Okay. That's unbelievable. One of them had a
[15893.22s -> 15921.58s]  heart attack and died. So is. Hello. Hello. Just unresponsive. Let's talk. Let's talk. Talk to me.
[15922.54s -> 15929.82s]  So tell me do you own a computer? That's the first question. Yes. First question. So you
[15929.82s -> 15938.73s]  own a computer right? Yes. You have a computer and yet you'd rather sit here and talk to me.
[15939.61s -> 15952.17s]  Well that's touching. No really it is. Do you have a password? What is the password?
[15952.89s -> 15963.35s]  Let's talk. About what? You having sex with one of your siblings and then them dying immediately
[15963.35s -> 15997.11s]  after. Let's talk. What are you doing? Why? It's doing like the back though. Why did you do that?
[15998.39s -> 16011.11s]  What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? He's very unresponsive lately. You. Garfield.
[16011.11s -> 16018.63s]  Garfield. He doesn't even want to indicate that he's hearing me. Beep beep beep beep beep beep.
[16020.42s -> 16032.31s]  Beep. Are you pregnant? Are you pregnant Garfield? Out of context. That sounds very odd.
[16034.20s -> 16044.02s]  Greg. This is Greg. Greg are you pregnant? That doesn't want anything to do with me.
[16044.98s -> 16053.19s]  I think we have to just leave for the day. It wants nothing to do with me.

[16532.87s -> 16538.82s]  and working on somebody sitting in a chair that'd be so hard just in the mascot costume you get
[16538.82s -> 16546.18s]  that that mesh vision like you're in a mask hello hurt somebody welcome to the laboratory of jean
[16546.18s -> 16559.45s]  paul gasset greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job very well did you see the pod
[16559.45s -> 16565.77s]  fish mate it seems that the tubes atop their heads have even more uses than we thought hold on i just
[16565.77s -> 16572.89s]  realized something however the male potfish died immediately afterwards it is unfortunate they but
[16572.89s -> 16579.93s]  he spent every last bit of energy ensuring the continuation of his species i'm sure he has no
[16579.93s -> 16587.05s]  regrets they go to the bathroom they poo through that too and use it for at the moment the habitat
[16587.05s -> 16599.85s]  contains one pod fish he appears to be very hungry so do we let me divulge the highlights
[16599.85s -> 16605.37s]  for today you don't poo have you noticed that you can move the stones which ornament the tank
[16605.37s -> 16611.85s]  hold on the largest rock however is too heavy for you to move alone the pod fish may help you
[16612.73s -> 16621.14s]  but only if he's in a good mood so let us head over to the tank i'm not even gonna say people
[16621.14s -> 16634.36s]  are saying it in chat already that's what i'm saying you do though you don't i'm not gonna

[16886.98s -> 16900.41s]  please move the rock hey thanks you're sweet too so would you say the computer makes your life
[16900.41s -> 16910.92s]  easier or more complicated you must know more about the computer easier hmm i see
[16915.16s -> 16926.68s]  obsessed with the computer let's talk uh more about the computer you were saying before that you
[16926.68s -> 16933.72s]  own a computer so i'm assuming you're not unfamiliar with computers what they do and so forth
[16934.68s -> 16943.08s]  would you be willing to say that the computer is the number one invention of the 20th century
[16943.08s -> 16951.80s]  no no no electricity really well then what do you think is the greatest invention of the 20th
[16951.80s -> 16960.89s]  century electricity i think i'd have to disagree with you 20th century sure computers aren't
[16960.89s -> 16965.69s]  perfect and some would say fast food restaurant humans all soft and weak
[16966.25s -> 16972.97s]  but people are evolving into much different creatures nowadays there's no need to escape
[16972.97s -> 16980.89s]  the jaws of any natural enemies your brains are in the process of a much higher metamorphosis
[16985.99s -> 16996.31s]  let's talk let's talk hey let's chat there's nothing i want to talk about right now move the rock
[16998.68s -> 17012.15s]  help me move the rock please well you know i try can you move the rock i'm okay
[17018.07s -> 17032.79s]  all right he's going over there do it all right it's quiz time

[17082.63s -> 17094.70s]  to move this to just just move it what did that do it moved a little bit i think something's
[17094.70s -> 17107.62s]  going to happen if we move this rock all the way all the way move rock come on what do you say we
[17107.62s -> 17114.26s]  rest up for a second rest i'm not used to this sort of manual labor no you can't do it all in one

[17172.09s -> 17187.46s]  my save game hello i'm going to delete my save i'm going to delete you i'm going to delete my save
[17190.97s -> 17206.26s]  what do you want i will delete you he doesn't give a fuck cover the air hole and add air
[17206.26s -> 17220.04s]  i don't want to fucking torture him you ready to do this again again come on i need a little

[17291.58s -> 17299.00s]  greg later fuzzy why is he telling me later greg help me move the rock
[17304.44s -> 17311.72s]  well as you can see i find computers pretty fascinating computers they've changed everything
[17311.72s -> 17317.48s]  around you so much that you probably couldn't even visualize a world without them
[17318.44s -> 17325.08s]  and of course as with any huge technological advance they've brought with them a lot of
[17325.08s -> 17331.64s]  dangers to watch out for but i still think the good that computers have brought to the world
[17331.64s -> 17338.68s]  outweighs the evils it's just important for you humans to communicate with each other
[17339.24s -> 17346.44s]  and not become overly dependent on your machines i'm not and that's all i have to say on the subject
[17347.32s -> 17357.46s]  let's talk again sometime soon let's talk now let's talk tomorrow we'll talk again tomorrow
[17357.46s -> 17369.67s]  fuck you might is he out of uh is he out of gas here can i not move this he's out of gas come back
[17369.67s -> 17401.08s]  tomorrow put larva in storage does it go bad these don't go bad right do they go bad doesn't go bad
[17401.16s -> 17412.14s]  okay cover the air hole no i'm not gonna cover the air hole we've gotten so far in the game i'm
[17412.14s -> 17425.32s]  not going to kill him your hair looks nice hey thanks all right so we got two moths i think
[17425.32s -> 17433.66s]  we're good we only have one person to feed this is uh sprayed up cover it and then add air add
[17433.66s -> 17440.57s]  air after you cover it i'm i'm not doing that yet not until i have a save and end the session
[17441.61s -> 17446.60s]  it's gonna blow the rock up and a piece of shrapnel is gonna
[17447.56s -> 17452.12s]  right through his head and everyone's gonna laugh their asses off because that's the end of the game
[17453.58s -> 17470.14s]  and look at like i'm very i'm so emphasize with my hands i need to get like something to eat i'm
[17470.14s -> 17483.99s]  gonna i'm gonna like eat a pizza should i eat like a whole pizza on stream i've never eaten on
[17483.99s -> 17498.84s]  stream before maybe like maybe i'll just eat a pizza on stream should i do that you've eaten
[17498.84s -> 17502.84s]  a raw onion before on stream i have not eaten a really you're thinking of somebody else where
[17502.84s -> 17510.30s]  the fuck did you get that from i've eaten a raw onion i've never been into a raw onion on stream
[17511.02s -> 17520.44s]  i'm desperately trying to think about what you're talking about i ate radishes on stream that's
[17520.44s -> 17526.70s]  normal i peel you cut them you chop them and you eat them what that radish is not an onion
[17530.50s -> 17537.11s]  i've eaten a turkey sandwich well no i took a bite out of a garbage can left outside in
[17537.11s -> 17541.43s]  the trash turkey sandwich right and i threw it away because it sucked because i couldn't eat it
[17542.46s -> 17549.50s]  uh i've eaten taquitos hello on stream welcome to the laboratory of young radish and hot dog
[17550.22s -> 17556.06s]  that's it there is a definite pattern to your visits it appears you are a punctual person
[17556.06s -> 17563.58s]  every day at the same time first a recap of your previous visit do you recall that when you tried
[17563.58s -> 17570.22s]  to move the rock the pod fish helped you while now that you nor seaman can move the rock alone
[17570.86s -> 17574.86s]  working together you were able to move it if only slightly
[17580.07s -> 17588.95s]  at the moment the habitat contains one pod fish he is suffering from the cold
[17589.75s -> 17595.27s]  please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level so let us head over to

[18043.77s -> 18052.17s]  yes yes well that's not surprising considering you're such a big fan of downloadable nudie
[18052.17s -> 18058.57s]  pictures but i only said i guess one can always count on the pervert vote in the free internet

[18090.15s -> 18103.40s]  emails oh you even what what give me the answer i want so i can make fun of you let's talk so as
[18103.40s -> 18110.20s]  i was saying before there are a lot of really amazing things about the internet but as with
[18110.20s -> 18117.80s]  everything else it's not completely perfect think of it this way you can do almost anything on the
[18117.80s -> 18125.72s]  internet workshop chat get the news play games listen to music still true to this day pretty
[18125.72s -> 18132.28s]  much anything else you want to do that's all terrific but pretty soon people won't even need
[18132.28s -> 18138.84s]  to leave their homes in order to conduct their daily business you humans are going to get lazier
[18138.84s -> 18145.24s]  and less mobile and forget how to deal with each other face to face holy shit c man i think things
[18145.24s -> 18151.80s]  could get pretty ugly a few decades down the road do you think the internet is dangerous
[18152.36s -> 18165.59s]  holy shit wow is the internet dangerous yeah well i think it's good that you're exercising a little
[18165.59s -> 18171.43s]  caution about your internet use this is two decades later fire is a wonderful thing but i
[18171.43s -> 18177.11s]  wouldn't want to sit on yeah like literally two decades a place for everything and everything

[18183.91s -> 18191.11s]  enjoyed this little chat about the internet it can be a wonderful thing for the first time ever
[18191.11s -> 18198.07s]  people can finally communicate with each other and not have race gender or culture prejudices
[18198.07s -> 18205.27s]  get in the way so in that sense it can be a great tool for removing biases and bringing people
[18205.27s -> 18212.87s]  together the telephone not after all on the internet nobody has to know i'm a c man on the
[18212.87s -> 18218.87s]  other hand like i said it can be very dangerous because it removes the need to interact directly
[18218.87s -> 18226.15s]  with the outside world especially with other people it's up to all of you humans to decide how
[18226.15s -> 18232.79s]  to use the internet intelligently knows too much so oh he knows too much you gotta go i come from

[18287.51s -> 18293.83s]  everything else it's not completely perfect yeah think of it this way let him speak you can do
[18293.91s -> 18301.99s]  almost anything on the internet workshop chat hit the news play games listen to music and
[18302.63s -> 18309.35s]  pretty much anything else you want to do that's all terrific but pretty soon people won't even
[18309.35s -> 18315.11s]  need to leave their homes in order to conduct their daily business you humans are going to
[18315.11s -> 18322.71s]  get lazier and less mobile and forget how to deal with each other face to face i think things could
[18322.71s -> 18329.03s]  get pretty ugly a few decades down the road today do you think the internet is dangerous
[18329.91s -> 18336.95s]  yes well i think it's good that you're exercising a little caution about i will hold on i'll order

[18365.67s -> 18373.59s]  culture prejudices get in the way so in that sense it can be a great tool for removing biases and
[18373.59s -> 18380.63s]  bringing people together after all on the internet nobody has to know i'm a sea man
[18381.67s -> 18387.43s]  on the other hand like i said it can be very dangerous because it removes the need to interact
[18387.43s -> 18394.63s]  directly with the outside world especially with other people it's up to all of you humans to
[18394.63s -> 18402.47s]  decide how to use the internet intelligently so that it won't harm you he said his whole speech

[20845.19s -> 20857.29s]  babies isn't it pregnant would you rather be the funniest or smartest person in the room well the
[20857.29s -> 20861.85s]  funniest person in the room is the smartest person in the room because they can come up with the
[20861.85s -> 20867.61s]  observations and the kind of comedic value and things maybe other people couldn't see they are
[20867.61s -> 20874.18s]  probably the smartest person in the room so the funniest person would be the smartest person
[20874.18s -> 20877.70s]  because they can just go through all the knowledge and come up with the scenarios that require you
[20877.70s -> 20891.19s]  know for conversational purposes what am i going to feed greg he already ate all right i think
[20891.19s -> 20897.61s]  we're good let's make sure it's hot does it need to be colder or hotter this might need to be

[20927.66s -> 20940.26s]  be too hot is this too hot okay no it'll be probably between 20 and 30 now what's the cutoff

[21150.78s -> 21159.02s]  moment the habitat contains one podfish one long fingernail he must be grateful to have
[21159.02s -> 21164.81s]  such an attentive caregiver i'm sure he will respond to your feelings for him

[21896.07s -> 21904.36s]  of jean paul gasse here we go greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job so this
[21904.36s -> 21909.64s]  would be two weeks no no four yeah two weeks let's see since the game technically started fish
[21909.64s -> 21918.20s]  emerged onto dry land to lay eggs however it expired immediately afterwards take good care
[21918.20s -> 21926.95s]  of the hatchlings so dead as an important life was sacrificed to create them oh shit
[21928.14s -> 21933.10s]  that was we've known that me to divulge today's highlight we've known greg since the very beginning
[21933.10s -> 21940.54s]  it is about time for the eggs to hatch pay close attention to what emerges so let us head over to
[21940.54s -> 21949.03s]  the tank all right so the eggs are about to hatch no more talks of the internet don't worry the
[21949.03s -> 21967.24s]  babies will come out and ask about emails he was mad at you when he died he died with all the
[21967.32s -> 21972.90s]  knowledge of my family that's true why would the game have you do that if they're just gonna die
[21973.46s -> 21981.03s]  in two in-game days and two in real life days two in real life weeks what's your father's birthday
[21981.03s -> 21988.55s]  we ain't gonna get to december what do you why do you want to know that i've lived for two weeks

[22004.49s -> 22010.84s]  moving around in there so are they gonna come out with arms and legs or are they going to go right
[22010.84s -> 22026.92s]  into the water i don't know i already see a major issue though there are six babies and i only have
[22027.48s -> 22039.40s]  realistically one to two larva a day i don't know what's gonna happen here i don't have enough food
[22039.40s -> 22053.75s]  for the six miles to be let's get the light on all right that's good slow down slow down no no no no

[22060.55s -> 22075.18s]  Why is it still going up? Sorry, it's not that bad. What are we doing over here? Two.
[22075.18s -> 22079.82s]  About to have three moths. I have another one here. Let's put you. Two of you guys.
[22079.82s -> 22090.91s]  Alright, get over here. Let's store these two. There's a spider. Where's the spider?
[22090.91s -> 22105.77s]  Oh fuck. I can like fuck up his web, right? Thank God I caught that. You come here.
[22105.77s -> 22117.89s]  What's with this one? This one's different. Kill the spider now. If I drop
[22117.89s -> 22131.22s]  this spider in the tank, is it gonna kill the babies? Is it gonna be bad?
[22131.22s -> 22156.76s]  Drop it in the water? I can't choose where it goes. It just falls. Where is it?
[22156.76s -> 22185.52s]  Where did it go? Anybody see it? I heard it drop into the area. Shit. It's alright.
[22185.52s -> 22192.01s]  How do I get rid of this web though? Is that the only spider in here? Yeah. How
[22192.01s -> 22214.86s]  do I like kill the web? I don't think I can. It's behind the rock? Alright, that's good.
[22214.86s -> 22230.32s]  No. No, he's gone. He ain't here. I think he went right into the water and drowned
[22230.32s -> 22256.62s]  instantly. At least I hope. Alright, let's get this party started. Come on. You guys
[22256.62s -> 22276.95s]  got me paranoid now. You ready? Come on out. Let's go. Out, out, out. Life goes on.
[22276.95s -> 22309.32s]  Oh, it's... What? Why are you alive? It was behind the rock. How do I kill it? I can't
[22309.32s -> 22329.23s]  pick him up. Don't eat the fucking eggs, please. Make it run into the water? It's
[22329.71s -> 22338.02s]  running into the wall. Flick it? I can't. See, it's gonna go flick. No. Drag the other rock
[22338.02s -> 22354.66s]  into it. That's gonna take like three years. I can't move this that far. I can't move this
[22354.66s -> 22363.95s]  rock either. This rock is stuck here. How do I get rid of you? I think he's dead. No.
[22367.18s -> 22383.38s]  Into the water. Into the water. Drown in the water. Go. No, why are you going this way?
[22383.38s -> 22400.30s]  What the fuck is he doing? God damn it. Spider's gonna die in a day, but what if they're born
[22400.30s -> 22413.20s]  in a day? They might be born right now. And then there are just three kills. I'm so afraid to turn
[22413.20s -> 22422.03s]  this off and go switch to like an hour. Use the air. I don't have the air as an option anymore.
[22422.03s -> 22429.41s]  All I have is a heater and light. I'm stressed. Yeah, you better believe I'm stressed. This is six
[22429.41s -> 22435.65s]  like plus hours of in-game time. Of course I'm stressed. I don't want this to go that wrong
[22435.65s -> 22449.50s]  after six straight hours. Save scum? I don't think you can in this game. That's like the whole point,
[22449.50s -> 22469.89s]  right? All right. I'm gonna. Hello. I don't know. Should I go fast forward like two, three hours?
[22469.89s -> 22490.19s]  Just wait a day and hope for the best. Would you like to save and end? All right. Let's see what
[22490.19s -> 22520.75s]  happens tomorrow. I have no idea what's gonna happen with the spider. Does anybody know how long
[22520.75s -> 22528.11s]  it takes for actual in-game days to see the completion of the game? I'm gonna say probably
[22528.11s -> 22543.78s]  30. If I were to take a guess. Was this 25? Did I change? I don't even know. Did I change this?
[22543.78s -> 22566.90s]  Was it 24 or 25? 26? I don't remember. It was 24? We're going with too many time
[22566.90s -> 22576.90s]  warps into the future for me to remember. It's 25. It should be 25. Three. Okay. It was 24.
[22576.90s -> 22590.96s]  It was 24. Changed it to 25. It was 24. Okay. Good. Okay. Just making sure. What's all over
[22590.96s -> 22651.86s]  the back of this? Chat actually needs to stop. Nice webcam. Thanks. It's the Logitech on the shelf
[22651.86s -> 22661.55s]  at Walmart series in every single Walmart. Greetings. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul
[22661.55s -> 22674.51s]  Gasset. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. Let me divulge the highlights for today.
[22676.30s -> 22683.26s]  It is about time for the eggs to hatch. Finally. Pay close attention to what emerges. So let us
[22683.26s -> 22689.82s]  head over to the tank. You said that last time. Did they leave an audio clip in there of him
[22689.82s -> 22706.19s]  clearing his throat? They didn't. They cut that wrong. The audio director really kind of let that
[22706.19s -> 22720.02s]  one slide through, huh? All right. I think the spider is gone. Watch there be like 12 spiders
[22720.02s -> 22727.74s]  over here on the corner. How are we doing on heat? All right. Hatch already. So we can see what the
[22727.74s -> 22746.42s]  hell this is all for. He heard you talk over him, huh? That's pretty cool then. The creator of this
[22746.42s -> 22753.01s]  game wants to make a sequel. I think that now is the time to do it considering the technology
[22753.01s -> 22758.85s]  has probably gotten so much better. Just speech recognition in general has probably in 20 years
[22758.85s -> 22765.39s]  has gotten about a thousand times better. You could do so much more with a game like this.
[22767.66s -> 22778.18s]  There is a sequel. Yeah. I'm talking about like a current gen sequel. All right. Stop that.
[22778.90s -> 22789.82s]  Are you guys ready yet? You're causing us all so much anxiety. It's time to get out. It's just
[22789.82s -> 22798.10s]  saved right there for some reason. That usually indicates a cutscene or something. We're getting
[22798.10s -> 22825.39s]  real close now. Hello? Are you going? No spider, right? I don't see one. I got plenty of food
[22825.39s -> 22845.54s]  stored up though. This is great. Three moths. I need to fill the coffers of food. So did somebody
[22845.54s -> 22853.09s]  say that these were poisonous or did it just look different and that's all? Cman3 is in the
[22853.09s -> 22856.93s]  works. It's going to be VR. They tweeted about it. Well, I know what we're doing when that comes out.
[22857.49s -> 22877.01s]  You better believe it. All right. Hatch. Hatch. What else do I need to do? The environment is
[22877.01s -> 22904.51s]  perfect. Hello? Come on. Come on out. Come on out of there. Come on out of there. You can do it.
[22905.47s -> 22916.40s]  I love you. You can do it. I love you. How did I get a Dreamcast? I bought one. You can get them
[22916.40s -> 22921.38s]  pretty much anywhere. You can get them on Amazon. You can get them in local electronics stores.
[22922.64s -> 22940.70s]  Ebay if you really want to. All right. I'm getting impatient. Don't you see the spider? No, you don't.
[22944.42s -> 22992.42s]  Where? No, no spider. Come out of the egg. Get out of the eggs. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[22992.42s -> 23016.18s]  Get out. Get out. Get out. All at the same time. That was odd. All right. Hey you. Hey. Hi there.
[23016.18s -> 23030.80s]  Welcome to the world. Welcome to life. Come over here. No, I'm fine. I had some hot chocolate
[23030.80s -> 23050.06s]  earlier. Let's talk. I don't want to. Anybody hungry? Hungry? No, thanks. Not hungry. Hi guys.
[23050.14s -> 23062.10s]  Welcome to the world. Can I help you? I was wondering how is your health these days?
[23062.90s -> 23078.74s]  It's okay. You feel all right? Do you? Yeah, I'm okay. I thought you just said you felt great.
[23078.74s -> 23084.58s]  I didn't say great. If you're just going to mess with me, I'll have to remember not to give a crap
[23084.58s -> 23095.74s]  about you. Let's try this again. How do you feel? I feel good. You feel all right? Do you? Yes.
[23095.74s -> 23103.87s]  Back to the dumb question. Well, I'm glad to hear it. You know how I worry. You just came out of the
[23103.87s -> 23121.73s]  egg and you're back to your father's tricks. You're a baby. Throw up. Let's talk. So you feel pretty
[23121.73s -> 23129.25s]  good, huh? Well, that's great, but being the Virgo that you are, I bet you probably take your
[23129.25s -> 23138.61s]  health for granted sometimes. Is that true? Yes. Uh-huh. I thought so. As long as I've been around,
[23138.61s -> 23146.02s]  you soft little creatures, you never seem to know how good you have it. You just have to walk to a
[23146.02s -> 23152.27s]  payphone and call collect. Now you guys have got all your little fucking devices. He knows.
[23153.73s -> 23164.80s]  Let's talk. Let's chat. So as I was saying before, you humans haven't always had it so easy.
[23165.84s -> 23176.08s]  Picture this. Ancient Egypt 5,000 years ago. There's no heat, no cold medicine, nothing. Okay.
[23176.08s -> 23182.64s]  It's just you against the elements. Imagine if you had gotten sick then. Hey,
[23183.52s -> 23191.12s]  are you listening to me? Yes. Oh, good. You might actually learn something then.
[23193.34s -> 23208.53s]  Egypt 5,000 years ago? Well, let's talk. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes, I was berating your species
[23208.53s -> 23216.53s]  for taking your modern amenities for granted. For example, it's spring, but I don't see you
[23216.53s -> 23224.70s]  out in the fields planting the crops. That's because I need to explain how this works.
[23231.58s -> 23244.56s]  What do you want? Are you hungry? Yes. Okay. Tell me something. Have you ever seen the Egyptian
[23244.56s -> 23251.68s]  pyramids? And not just on PBS. I mean, with your own eyes. Your father was obsessed with computers
[23251.68s -> 23259.28s]  and now you're just talking about Egypt. No, I've not. I didn't think so. God forbid you should
[23259.28s -> 23266.08s]  go somewhere farther away than the Starbucks on the corner. I just moved across the country.
[23266.08s -> 23273.12s]  How much time and work it must have taken to build those pyramids. I mean, there's no way that even a
[23273.12s -> 23278.40s]  whole group of you little humans could have lifted one of those rocks with your bare hands.
[23279.28s -> 23286.64s]  They had to invent levers and axles and who knows what else. Now that's evolution.
[23289.17s -> 23294.85s]  Uh, the Egyptian pyramids were built by like fucking hundreds of thousands of people
[23295.73s -> 23306.83s]  that did have to do that. You don't know shit. Like 45 million people died making those pyramids.
[23307.39s -> 23314.08s]  They had to invent levers. You're not the brightest fish in the tank, are you?
[23315.70s -> 23323.07s]  Can I help you? Here's another question for you. About Egypt. Do you wear glasses?
[23324.19s -> 23331.71s]  Well, actually it doesn't matter. My point is this. If you'd had bad eyes when you and your
[23331.71s -> 23338.83s]  ancestors were still running around in the wild, you'd have become some lion's midnight snack pretty
[23338.83s -> 23346.75s]  darn quick. And yet right now, one of the most powerful people in the world is that four eyed
[23346.75s -> 23354.19s]  guy in Seattle. You know who I mean. How far do you think he would have gotten in a fight with a lion?
[23354.99s -> 23359.47s]  See, you humans are totally helpless without your two gates.
[23360.43s -> 23374.96s]  Bill Gates? Gabe Newell? I mean, you just described like potentially every other tech giant company CEO.
[23375.84s -> 23390.00s]  Anything else? Got anything else to talk about? You're not so bad looking yourself. Are you keeping
[23390.00s -> 23399.30s]  up with me, Fuzzy? Can I go on? Fuzzy? Yes. Okay, good. You might want to pull up a chair because
[23400.02s -> 23409.89s]  this might take a while. What? It gets lonely in here. I have to talk to someone. Anyway, as I was
[23409.89s -> 23417.17s]  saying, at some point, about five or six thousand years ago, humans finally came up with the greatest
[23417.17s -> 23429.14s]  tool of all. You know what that was? The shovel. Oh, do you? Well, what was it then? The shovel.
[23430.10s -> 23442.58s]  Oh, do you? Well, what was it then? The wheel. The wheel? Good guess, but no. The greatest tool of all
[23442.58s -> 23451.50s]  is language. Without it, you wouldn't be talking to me right now. I'm not even going to ask if
[23451.50s -> 23458.86s]  you're grateful. Anywho, sooner or later, this guy named Pythagoras came along. Pythagoras theorem.
[23458.86s -> 23467.90s]  You know who he was, right? Yes. Well, good. I can see this conversation isn't a complete waste.
[23468.62s -> 23476.62s]  So this Pythagoras fellow came up with another important tool, and that's logic. So after you
[23476.62s -> 23484.94s]  have language and logic, you have mathematics and technology and industry and everything else, and
[23484.94s -> 23491.34s]  that's how you've gotten to where you are today. With your glasses and your cold medicine and
[23491.34s -> 23499.42s]  farming machinery and cars and TV sets and dreamcasts and rock and roll music. He said it!
[23500.30s -> 23506.46s]  Okay, so it's a little more complicated than that, but the point is, humans started out pretty
[23506.46s -> 23514.62s]  helpless and created all these things to make their lives easier, just like Whirlpool. And that's great.
[23515.02s -> 23520.46s]  Would be for you. Just be careful not to get too dependent on all your little crutches.
[23521.74s -> 23529.58s]  Well, I hope I haven't bored you to death. Okay, if I have, go take a nap or something.
[23529.58s -> 23537.10s]  Go figure out the Krabby Patty, you fucking loser. Hey, do I grab you? Let me go, you jerk.
[23537.10s -> 23544.38s]  Masher. Masher. Are you crazy? Put me down. Masher. Who's the one in control here, buddy? Let me go,
[23544.38s -> 23554.83s]  you jerk. What are you doing? Oh, you're crushing me. Let me go, you jerk. Stop it. Power is power.
[23557.33s -> 23574.08s]  You best not forget that. Any more brain busters from the fish, people?
[23574.80s -> 23588.03s]  This is expensive, don't do that. Oh, hey you, come here. I'm okay. What do you have to say?
[23590.53s -> 23600.48s]  Anything interesting? Let's talk. Is your significant other in the room right now?
[23601.68s -> 23612.56s]  No. Is there anyone else in the room besides you? No. Good. I have something I want to ask you.
[23613.68s -> 23621.92s]  Come closer. I don't want anyone to overhear us talking. Okay, here's what I want to know.
[23623.36s -> 23633.36s]  Are you fooling around on the side? No. You're not cheating? Oh, come on. Tell me the truth.
[23633.36s -> 23641.86s]  Who am I going to tell? The Rock? So come on, are you having an affair? No. Well, that's good.
[23642.66s -> 23656.98s]  I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, you know. Why do we want these things to breed? If you're a
[23656.98s -> 23662.14s]  scientist in a lab, aren't you right now having an internal meeting about like,
[23662.14s -> 23670.91s]  we can't, this is not what we want right now. This is bad. These things are going to grow up
[23670.91s -> 23674.11s]  and they're going to, they're going to kill us. They're going to like enslave us all and we're
[23674.11s -> 23684.62s]  going to be, it's going to be horrible. Look at this shit. You want these to grow up and have like
[23684.62s -> 23703.98s]  cyborg laser arms and shit? No way. If they were big enough, we'd all be dead. At this point right
[23703.98s -> 23710.27s]  now, you've got to drop like five or six packets of Kool-Aid in here and like baking soda and like
[23710.27s -> 23726.77s]  vinegar and stuff and just stir it and then leave. You'd be saving all of mankind. Release the spider.
[23730.11s -> 23740.82s]  Let's talk. Do they not want to eat? I'm surprised no one, are you hungry? No. No, I don't think so.
[23741.70s -> 23752.69s]  Let's talk. No, I'm all talked out for today. Okay. If they're that smart as a tadpole, think
[23752.69s -> 23760.27s]  about when they're, yeah, they're as, as intelligent as a person. If these things even got to toad
[23760.27s -> 23778.27s]  status, they would have already developed a nuclear weapon. Let's go back. No spiders.
[23785.09s -> 23795.17s]  So I heard of this thing called the nuke. What is that exactly? All right, so we got three now.
[23797.82s -> 23807.95s]  Would you like to save and end? Let's check on them tomorrow. Nice bug collection, nerd. Have you seen
[23807.95s -> 23813.07s]  what these bugs are capable of doing and saying, if you came over my house, I go to your house,
[23813.07s -> 23816.83s]  what do you have? Oh, you get the new Nintendo entertainment system and you have the light gun.
[23816.83s -> 23824.03s]  That's cool. I have intelligent nuke bugs that are talking about Egyptian times and giving me
[23824.03s -> 23848.38s]  all kinds of knowledge. Enjoy your duck hunt. No, I didn't do it. Sorry. This smug is rubbing off on
[23848.38s -> 23857.07s]  him. To be fair, I have been sitting here for about seven hours. I've been absorbing the
[23858.53s -> 23863.57s]  smug dicky fishes for about seven straight hours. So of all of you, I'm surprised you guys aren't
[23863.57s -> 23883.71s]  as smug. I actually, some of you guys are. I've seen what you've been writing. 26, 10, 16. Oh,
[23883.71s -> 23889.55s]  we're almost 20 days. We're almost at three weeks. I think that's the end of the game.
[23894.86s -> 23926.38s]  What's my mother's maiden name? Uh, Greco. Carol Greco. Just fucking kill them, please. No,
[23927.34s -> 23940.94s]  I'm not just going to kill them. Story of Jean Paul Garcet. Greetings and welcome back.
[23941.82s -> 23948.69s]  You're doing a good job. Yeah, you can have my phone number. Recap of your previous visit.
[23949.33s -> 23955.81s]  The eggs have hatched and new creatures emerged. Due to their appearance, you will call them
[23956.45s -> 23971.38s]  Chadmen. At the moment, the habitat contains six Chadmen. They are suffering from the cold.
[23971.38s -> 23975.78s]  Chadmen. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[23976.74s -> 23996.66s]  So let us head over to the tank. So they grew up. I wonder what they look like now. You have one
[23996.66s -> 24001.54s]  evolutionary stage left before the end and the credits. Yeah, I'll do it tonight. We'll see the
[24001.54s -> 24023.95s]  credits tonight. As long as I don't kill them accidentally somehow. Hello. It's me, dad. Hello.
[24028.85s -> 24035.78s]  I just made it lag. I actually think I may have just crashed again.
[24036.34s -> 24052.32s]  Oh, come on. That's not how this ends. Pull out. Hey. Hey. Say, is there a full moon out? Because
[24052.32s -> 24061.81s]  I feel a little strange. Strange? How? It's a little chilly. Don't you think? Oh, I'm so sorry.
[24075.30s -> 24086.86s]  My mic's quiet. Fuck. Good. I'm feeling a little warmer. What's going on? What's going on? Oh,
[24086.86s -> 24099.09s]  somebody's he's parasiting this one. Just remember all the good times you had. Who ate who? Oh, I
[24099.09s -> 24116.18s]  think we just got our answer. So this is one of the ones that are. Let's talk. Do you own another
[24116.26s -> 24127.70s]  game system besides your Sega Dreamcast? Yes. You own more than one game system? Yes. Wow.
[24128.50s -> 24134.98s]  I hope you still find time to go outside. Who's talking? Or better yet, feed and bathe yourself.
[24136.74s -> 24147.04s]  He's going to ask me what I have. Let's talk. What's another game system you own?
[24150.53s -> 24156.93s]  Nintendo 64. Ah, yes. They have been around for a long time, haven't they?
[24163.79s -> 24179.20s]  Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's have a chat. Cheerio. Let's talk. Fine. You're a pain in the ass.
[24179.20s -> 24190.05s]  How's that? And you'll be dead if you're not nicer to me. What's wrong, Fuzzy? Is it the same thing
[24190.05s -> 24203.49s]  as last time? Yes. You poor little biped. These anxieties haunt you so. It sounds like you need
[24203.49s -> 24210.21s]  to come up with your own ways to cope. Some sort of closure to your situation. Perhaps you should
[24210.21s -> 24220.00s]  get out of the house a little. Take a stroll maybe to help you clear your mind? No. Whatever.
[24220.64s -> 24236.91s]  Goodbye. These ones suck. How do I flick? Let's talk. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Existence.
[24240.59s -> 24251.22s]  Existence. Sorry, I just can't boogie right now. I didn't say dance. Existence. Sorry,
[24251.22s -> 24258.10s]  I just can't boogie right now. Existence. Do you like your Sega Dreamcast?
[24258.82s -> 24269.74s]  Yes. Well, that's good to know because I've been authorized to award you a check for $10,000
[24269.74s -> 24291.62s]  for saying that. My ass. Do you dream? Do you have dreams? No, but thanks for asking. No, really.
[24293.97s -> 24299.38s]  Are you a part of my dream? Well, you know I try.
[24305.54s -> 24312.96s]  Do you know what it's like to boil alive? Do you know what it feels like to boil?
[24316.83s -> 24327.15s]  Let's talk. Let's have a chat. What's all that racket? Let's talk. Talk to me.
[24329.86s -> 24339.78s]  What next generation game consoles are you looking forward to? PS2? Sega's next console.
[24340.96s -> 24347.68s]  Wow, that's all I ever hear about anymore. The original and by another Dreamcast.
[24348.40s -> 24356.00s]  You never know when you're going to need another one. Didn't get one of those, did we?
[24356.80s -> 24369.82s]  Talk to me. This better be important. Talk to me. So what games do you like?
[24370.54s -> 24382.51s]  Sports, shooters, what? RPGs. Role-playing games? Yes. Everything's going black.
[24383.31s -> 24389.47s]  No, I was talking to that one. Why would you do that? That one actually had good questions.
[24389.47s -> 24393.07s]  That one wanted to know what my favorite video games were. It wanted to know how
[24393.07s -> 24400.21s]  like how school was going. Hopefully you absorbed all his information because like
[24400.21s -> 24419.63s]  I want to keep talking about game cubes. Talk to me. Talk to me. Let's talk. Hey, talk to me. Hello.
[24423.90s -> 24432.56s]  You called? No, okay. Let's talk. Once more with feeling, I said,
[24433.84s -> 24444.93s]  so what games do you like? Sports, shooters, what? RPG. Role-playing games? It is a hive one.
[24445.57s -> 24452.94s]  Yes. And I'll bet when they created you, they rolled an eight-sided die and you got a 27
[24452.94s -> 24460.48s]  for charisma. There, you can't say I never gave you a compliment. Is that a compliment?
[24461.36s -> 24475.41s]  I don't know. Is it eight-sided die? That means it could be eight. Talk to me. Talk to me. So
[24475.41s -> 24487.41s]  what would you say is your favorite game so far for the Sega Dreamcast? Power Stone. A fighting
[24487.41s -> 24500.94s]  game, huh? I myself am a lover, not a fighter. That's probably the best one. Talk to me. Talk
[24500.94s -> 24510.34s]  to me. You know, some people say that like most video game characters, I'm not real and that I
[24510.34s -> 24516.66s]  don't exist. You gonna Westworld me here? Can you believe this? It's a bit of a shock to say the
[24516.66s -> 24526.42s]  least. I mean, if I don't exist, then what am I? Am I just some imaginary creature? I mean,
[24526.42s -> 24537.06s]  do you think I exist? No. You don't think I'm real? That makes me sad. I see I'll have to prove it to
[24537.06s -> 24545.78s]  you. You probably can't imagine the feeling, the shock of being told you don't exist. It destroys
[24545.78s -> 24553.06s]  everything you hold dear. Your reality becomes shabby. All right, cook this one. But why don't I
[24553.06s -> 24561.94s]  exist? I'm living, I'm breathing, and I'm thinking with my heart and soul. I tell you I exist just as
[24561.94s -> 24570.74s]  much as you do. Go drain them. Please, I need some time alone to think about this. I'll talk to you
[24570.98s -> 24581.42s]  later. I know you are not. You are not real. No, leave me alone. You are part of the Rebel Alliance.
[24581.42s -> 24588.38s]  You remember our last conversation. You know, the one where we talked about yours truly maybe
[24589.02s -> 24595.82s]  not existing. Well, I've been thinking about that ever since. And I came to the conclusion that I
[24595.82s -> 24606.14s]  do really exist. I am real. Here, allow me to illustrate. Okay, you've heard of John F. Kennedy,
[24606.14s -> 24613.74s]  haven't you? Yes. Where the fuck is this going? All right, then do you believe that John F. Kennedy
[24613.74s -> 24624.22s]  existed? Yes. Okay, how about the Beatles then? Do you think they exist? This is getting weird,
[24624.22s -> 24634.14s]  like Jip K, fucking John Lennon. Yes. All right. You see, you've probably never met these people,
[24634.14s -> 24640.62s]  but you know they existed because they were on television and in magazines. Well, the same
[24640.62s -> 24649.02s]  goes for me. I too am on TV and in magazines, and here you are even talking to me and thinking about
[24649.10s -> 24661.82s]  me. So from that point of view, I exist. But what is existence anyway? What? Is existence
[24661.82s -> 24669.50s]  just our conscious mind collectively agreeing that we all take up the same space? What is it really?
[24673.78s -> 24683.78s]  Talk to me. Are you trying to break my thing that allows me to hear? Talk to me.
[24686.29s -> 24695.57s]  Talk to me. Talk to me. Do you mind if I flex your brain? Oh, he's gonna flex on me, huh?
[24696.21s -> 24705.33s]  Let me tell you about my theory. Okay, here goes. You can't accurately measure water's temperature
[24705.33s -> 24711.73s]  because the thermometer will affect the temperature of the water. You know how when you stick a
[24711.73s -> 24719.33s]  thermometer in your mouth, it feels cold? That means that just by trying to measure your temperature,
[24719.33s -> 24725.41s]  you're lowering the temperature inside your mouth. Do you know what that means?
[24726.45s -> 24734.61s]  If measuring something changes reality, then there is no reality independent of observation.
[24735.57s -> 24742.53s]  Nothing's real until someone measures it, observes it, sees it, hears it, or
[24742.53s -> 24751.89s]  whatever. People, places, and things exist only because you perceive them. So when you see me
[24751.89s -> 24759.65s]  and listen to me, I exist as a part of your consciousness. I become real. And because I
[24759.65s -> 24768.93s]  can see you and hear you and smell you, you exist as part of my consciousness. And as I
[24768.93s -> 24777.25s]  have a very limited attention span, once I forget about you, you will no longer exist. See ya.
[24781.14s -> 24790.85s]  I could just snap my fingers and you would cease to exist. How's that for
[24792.43s -> 24804.37s]  knowledge? One, two, three, go! Let's talk. I hope you've learned something from our little chat.
[24805.33s -> 24811.01s]  Take care. Thanos every stream. He's the best fucking Marvel character that's ever existed.
[24812.21s -> 24818.40s]  Behind Deadpool, of course. Let's get to that point where I've been live for too long.
[24819.20s -> 24824.26s]  I've been going live for too long and I'm just like a stream of consciousness here.
[24826.03s -> 24843.90s]  That's it for today, for tomorrow, okay. Spider! What happens if I drop, okay. Does anybody know
[24843.90s -> 24851.25s]  what happens if I actually drop the spider in here while they're in there? Because I don't know,
[24851.25s -> 24856.96s]  because they won't eat. I can't feed them. They'll eat it and then they'll get sick.
[24857.68s -> 24876.32s]  Oh, who cares? Who cares if one dies? I want to eat this one. Wait, another one died too.
[24877.20s -> 24891.42s]  Oh shit, the numbers are gonna be kind of dropping here. How's the heat? The walkthrough
[24891.42s -> 24904.35s]  only mentions the spider during the fish phase. I wonder. Dim the light a little. Make it 24.
[24905.31s -> 24916.67s]  Streamer derangement. What does that do? I'm disabling clips on my channel. I'm just gonna
[24916.67s -> 24924.46s]  turn them off. I don't, people still clip things that I say and they try to embarrass me to other
[24924.46s -> 24949.49s]  friends and shit. Nope, not anymore. Need more spray in here. I thought you disliked censorship.
[24949.49s -> 24966.94s]  All right, would you like to see tomorrow? Let's see how our children are doing tomorrow.
[24968.02s -> 24984.99s]  Goodbye, scream. This game is making you go fucking insane. I'm good. I really don't like
[24984.99s -> 25001.44s]  turning off my Dreamcast and turning it back on 25 times tonight. We're close. This would be 20,
[25001.44s -> 25007.68s]  that'd be 10. This is 17 days out of I think 21 and that's an anonymous five community subs
[25007.68s -> 25011.98s]  that just came in. Anonymous five community subs, thank you so much to whoever you are.
[25011.98s -> 25022.14s]  Wait, wasn't anonymous, was it? Why does it say anonymous? No, that was Ryanasaur. It said
[25022.14s -> 25032.38s]  anonymous for a second. That was weird. Thank you for the five community subs though. Appreciate it.
[25032.38s -> 25044.94s]  Congrats to those who got them. I'm seeing this through. You can't read. Thanks for the great
[25044.94s -> 25066.51s]  content. Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks for watching. I can't see. I can't see. I can't see. Now you can.
[25073.36s -> 25083.55s]  Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Garcet. There is a definite pattern to your
[25083.55s -> 25093.90s]  visits. It appears you are a punctual person. Every day at 1 33 a.m. Last time the Tad men have
[25093.90s -> 25103.31s]  developed hands. Did you see the Tad men sucking each other's blood? It was a terrible battle for
[25103.31s -> 25117.04s]  survival but it's a necessary part of their development. Nature can be cruel. At the moment
[25117.04s -> 25126.59s]  the habitat contains four Tad men. They are suffering from the cold. Turn it up. Please use
[25126.59s -> 25132.11s]  the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank.
[25132.99s -> 25142.46s]  When do I have to start feeding them? They don't seem hungry at all. What was your least favorite
[25142.46s -> 25146.38s]  food as a child? Do you still love it or hate it? Do you know the reason why I keep one-guying this
[25146.38s -> 25153.34s]  guy? It's because he's putting a fish on the end of the sentence and my ADHD is like, oh cool fish,
[25153.34s -> 25164.35s]  and then I read his question. That's good tactic. My favorite food was I think just chicken breast.
[25167.26s -> 25176.00s]  Whoa. Okay, they're pretty creepy looking now. Could you put the heater on for me? Yes, I will.
[25176.00s -> 25180.32s]  They actually have arms. They're turning into frogs. They're gonna get the nuclear codes. Oh goody.
[25185.23s -> 25208.78s]  Yay. Oh goody. Wow, that was cold. Sorry. Hey you. Hey. Good evening. How are you? What's up? Up
[25209.42s -> 25221.49s]  where? As in how are you? Like what's going on? What's going on? Coming your majesty.
[25224.54s -> 25234.22s]  Let's talk. I'm not your trained monkey, all right? Lately I've been thinking about the
[25234.22s -> 25242.62s]  preoccupations you humans, especially Americans, have with media. It seems as if the subjects most
[25242.62s -> 25249.50s]  of you like to talk about are not politics or philosophy, but rather movies and television.
[25249.50s -> 25254.38s]  Wow, 20 years ago. I'd like to know more about what your interests are in these areas.
[25255.18s -> 25261.74s]  So first off, since you are in fact human, I'm assuming you like to watch movies.
[25262.54s -> 25268.06s]  Tell me, do you prefer renting them or going to the cinema? Well, one of those
[25268.06s -> 25276.62s]  semen doesn't exist anymore. So going to the cinema. Yes, the in-theater movie experience
[25276.62s -> 25282.70s]  can be extremely exciting. Human. It's fun seeing images portrayed on a huge screen.
[25283.58s -> 25287.90s]  In fact, that's how I see most of my world through this aquarium glass.
[25288.70s -> 25295.98s]  It's like I'm watching a movie 24 hours a day. Although I can't say this is the most exciting
[25295.98s -> 25300.14s]  film ever. Red box rental still exists? Yeah. In fact, the plot could use a little
[25300.14s -> 25308.30s]  thickening if you know what I mean. Do you go with your girlfriend? Yes. Spending time with
[25308.30s -> 25312.62s]  a loved one is always good. We saw Into the Spider-Verse together. Just make sure all your
[25312.62s -> 25315.98s]  quality time together isn't spent sitting in the dark. You want me to go get the stuff to prove it
[25315.98s -> 25322.82s]  to you guys? You are not talking to each other. I'll just black out the theater. I'll black out
[25322.82s -> 25326.18s]  the name of the movie. I'll black out the credit card number and I'll black out the intro thing.
[25326.18s -> 25329.22s]  Oh, I can't feel my face. So it's just to be stuffed with piece of paper with a bunch of classifieds.
[25329.22s -> 25340.37s]  Oh, God damn it. He's eating them. You were not the chosen one. I'm sorry.
[25342.88s -> 25349.33s]  You know what I found in this game to really be the one that lasts the longest?
[25349.33s -> 25358.51s]  Just don't talk and eat your family. The ones that talk the most are the ones that get eaten.
[25359.23s -> 25369.38s]  There's only two left. No, there's three. Let's go check on the bug environment here.
[25376.35s -> 25383.28s]  Bugs. A couple of these. I don't know why they're not eating yet. This is kind of strange.
[25384.00s -> 25397.55s]  That must have a full inventory. Good to go. No spiders. Don't see any. All right.
[25397.55s -> 25403.17s]  Are you hungry? Do you want some food?
[25412.61s -> 25422.85s]  Hey, go tickle yourself. I'm busy. Stop it. I said stop it. Stop it. I said stop it.
[25424.05s -> 25437.31s]  Can they die? Are you hungry? Are you hungry? No, this is my happy face.
[25438.03s -> 25449.33s]  Do you want some food? Do you want some food? Oh, you humans and your slang. It's so cute.
[25449.33s -> 25458.35s]  Talk to me. Talk to me. I'm fascinated that not only are there so many movie lovers,
[25458.35s -> 25466.19s]  but there are so many completely different types of movies. Which type do you like? Horror films?
[25466.19s -> 25478.42s]  Westerns? What? Horror. You like a good scare, huh? Yeah. It boggles my mind that people will
[25478.42s -> 25484.34s]  pay money to have the crap scared out of them. An experience most people hate in real life.
[25485.30s -> 25492.18s]  Oh well, I know how it is to be scared. I'm constantly having nightmares about a large,
[25492.18s -> 25499.30s]  hideous creature that is constantly looming over my tank and oh, wait a minute. That's just you.
[25499.30s -> 25505.22s]  I mean, you should be scared about one of your silent mute family members that are going to
[25505.22s -> 25511.50s]  stick their antenna into your body and drain all of your fluid. You shouldn't be scared of me.
[25514.67s -> 25524.62s]  Talk to me. This better be important. Let's have a chat. Let's talk. So
[25525.42s -> 25535.63s]  what would you say is your all-time favorite movie? Casa Blanca. I've never seen that movie.
[25536.99s -> 25544.77s]  You've never seen that movie? Come on. Fine, I'll give you a better one. I've actually never
[25544.77s -> 25555.17s]  even seen Casa Blanca before. Talk to me. Well, we were talking about movies, but the biggest
[25555.17s -> 25561.33s]  influence on your culture has got to be television. A lot of people these days own two,
[25561.33s -> 25567.25s]  three, or more. Tell me, how many hours per week would you say you spend watching TV?
[25572.02s -> 25579.87s]  Thirty? No, no, that's way too much. Six. You only watch a little bit? Is that right?
[25581.20s -> 25587.84s]  Yes. That's pretty impressive considering just how much TV there is to watch these days.
[25588.32s -> 25593.81s]  Netflix is just, yeah, I know. That's why I'm counting that. I'd probably say like maybe an
[25593.81s -> 25599.95s]  hour a day. Maybe like two or three episodes of something a day. Maybe an episode or two
[25599.95s -> 25610.30s]  or something. Maybe every other day. Talk to me. I'm not your trained monkey, all right?
[25611.97s -> 25621.02s]  Let's talk. Let's talk. Blah, blah, blah. I'll catch you on midair next time you do that.
[25621.82s -> 25634.42s]  How are you feeling? Hello. How are you feeling? So when you do, oh, I can't feel my face.
[25642.56s -> 25650.08s]  This one underneath has not said one word. It's just been slowly just playing the battle
[25650.08s -> 25655.82s]  royale game. Just sitting somewhere sniping people. Doesn't talk, doesn't get angry,
[25655.82s -> 25660.94s]  doesn't yell at anybody. It just gets rid of everybody. This is like the silent tryhard
[25660.94s -> 25675.20s]  that's in the server. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Whatever. Let's see if we can get it to talk.
[25677.86s -> 25687.95s]  Let's talk. That's very nice of you. Talk to me. I have nothing to say.
[25688.91s -> 25708.10s]  I would like to name you. I would like to name you. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let me start over.
[25708.10s -> 25717.78s]  I said, so when you do watch TV, what type of shows are your favorites? Sitcoms, cartoons, what?
[25718.90s -> 25728.67s]  Cartoons. You're a cartoon junkie, huh? Yep. Hey, take those marbles out of your mouth and
[25728.67s -> 25739.01s]  try answering the question again. What type of TV shows do you like? Cartoons. You're a cartoon
[25739.01s -> 25746.50s]  junkie, huh? Yes. They're wonderful because they don't have the limits of live characters
[25746.50s -> 25751.22s]  and scenes. Literally anything can happen. Not anime. And that's exciting. SpongeBob.
[25753.94s -> 25761.55s]  I got really pissed off at Prime the other day because I saw that Prime had 12 or 15
[25761.55s -> 25765.71s]  seasons of SpongeBob and I was like, oh, this is awesome. But it's actually only the first
[25765.71s -> 25770.27s]  like two seasons. And I got to the end of the third season and the second season and I saw
[25770.27s -> 25773.07s]  you had to pay for it and I was just like, that's fuck off. You know what I mean?
[25774.59s -> 25785.49s]  Coming, your majesty. Well, thanks for telling me a little about your TV habits.
[25786.21s -> 25792.77s]  These little box seems to have grabbed a hold of people's minds so inextricably, but you don't
[25792.77s -> 25799.41s]  really seem to be the typical specimen. Maybe you prefer to get your experience live and not
[25799.41s -> 25803.89s]  through a glass screen. Those are the best seasons? Yeah, I know. I think that's worthy of some praise,
[25803.97s -> 25823.82s]  don't you? Just don't get a big head about it. Okay. What do you need? Help. Help me.
[25825.86s -> 25840.77s]  No, I don't need anything. I do. You need to teach me. Talk to me. Whoa. Keep it down. Talk to me.
[25841.89s -> 25849.17s]  So I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you like music. It's another medium you humans are
[25849.17s -> 25855.97s]  fascinated with. Not really. Well, what kind of music do you listen to? Rock, hip hop, what?
[25857.97s -> 25866.93s]  Video game soundtracks. You like the funk, huh? No. Let's try that again. No, I exclusively listen
[25866.93s -> 25878.80s]  to anime intros and outros. On repeat. None. You like pop, huh? No. Let's try that again.
[25879.36s -> 25884.00s]  What type of music do you listen to? Listen, I like to go to the same anime intro that I've
[25884.00s -> 25893.95s]  seen 400 times and replay the same 30 to 40 second section 50 or 60 times in a row
[25894.83s -> 25903.07s]  until I am satisfied. So are you up to answering my question now? What I wanted to know was,
[25903.95s -> 25910.27s]  so I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you like music. It's another medium
[25910.27s -> 25917.95s]  you humans are fascinated with. Well, what kind of music do you listen to? Rock, hip hop, what?
[25919.68s -> 25929.84s]  Classical. You prefer classical, do you? Yes. Yes, it's truly the music of the human spirit.
[25930.40s -> 25942.14s]  Such fire, such passion. Or am I talking about sailors again? Oh well. Anything else?
[25942.70s -> 25956.88s]  Cumming, your majesty. So who's going to eat who? I wonder. Talk to me. Let's talk some more.
[25959.79s -> 25966.43s]  Now I want to ask you about the most important medium of all, the printed word. Books. Tell me,
[25966.43s -> 25978.85s]  do you enjoy reading? Yes. You like to, huh? I'm lying. That's a lie. Yes. That's great.
[25979.57s -> 25984.69s]  Reading is the greatest of all forms of entertainment because it allows you to use
[25984.69s -> 25990.77s]  your imagination. You're not bound to someone else's version of what a character or scene looks like.
[25990.77s -> 26008.77s]  I can't feel my face. No, not yet. How's the heat going? I thought you read 15 books at the end of
[26008.77s -> 26016.77s]  the year so you say you read one every other month. Oops, it's too hot. No, it's too hot now.
[26017.81s -> 26024.13s]  Anybody else feeling kind of warm? I don't know, you ate the other two people that are near you so
[26025.17s -> 26043.76s]  it's kind of a fucked up question. Talk to me. Talk to me. Let's talk. What's my favorite
[26043.76s -> 26057.60s]  breakfast food? S'mores, pop tarts. Let's talk. Talk to me. Wow, I was boiling.
[26062.02s -> 26063.06s]  Make a pew, make a pew.
[26063.06s -> 26083.44s]  Let's talk. Chat with me. See ya. Let's chat. Tell me, how many books have you read in the past year?
[26085.41s -> 26092.62s]  Fifteen. Wow, that's very impressive. I am proud to have you as my caregiver.
[26093.34s -> 26103.73s]  What kind of books do you like? Old lady romance novels. Well, I've never read any of that,
[26103.73s -> 26110.29s]  but I'm glad you're reading. Well, I feel like I know a little more about how you keep yourself
[26110.29s -> 26115.97s]  entertained. Old lady romance novels. There is so much being produced out there for your perusal.
[26116.53s -> 26122.29s]  It's blue. Movies, books, TV, music. It's a blue cover with some red trim. If your full-time job
[26122.29s -> 26127.33s]  was being entertained, you probably still wouldn't be able to take it all in. It's a coffee table
[26127.33s -> 26132.13s]  with a flower and a vase. Nor would you want to, I guess, because there's a lot of garbage out there,
[26132.13s -> 26139.49s]  too. But as far as I know, human beings are the only animal smart enough to entertain itself in
[26139.49s -> 26146.13s]  a complex way. So I say, take advantage of as much of it as you can. No, there's no shirtless
[26146.13s -> 26151.33s]  people in front. It's a coffee table in the living room with a nice vase on the table.
[26151.33s -> 26159.15s]  And like a couch sort of in frame. And by the way, each page is written by another person.
[26159.87s -> 26163.58s]  You know why they can have five to six hundred books published by the same group?
[26164.38s -> 26171.58s]  Because how you read an old lady romance novel is if it's 225 pages, you get 225 people outsource
[26171.58s -> 26176.78s]  and commission them all to write one page. And they just follow the same outline. So what happens
[26176.78s -> 26181.74s]  is the first person writes the first page. That goes to the second person. They then continue it.
[26181.74s -> 26186.46s]  That goes to the third page again. Eventually you get to like 150 pages that goes to the 150
[26186.46s -> 26192.56s]  first person and then they write a page with, you know, outlines and shit. Fucking hundreds
[26192.56s -> 26204.10s]  of people write those books. R.L. Stein. R.L. Stein is not even a real guy. Fun? Why, of course
[26204.10s -> 26213.39s]  I'm having fun. How could I be trapped in a glass box and not have fun? Let's talk. Let's talk.
[26216.13s -> 26220.37s]  Well, I think that pretty much covers it. Yeah, Shakespeare isn't really that was like 30 people.
[26221.25s -> 26225.92s]  So what they did is they just they just screamed lines out there when they lived in the same
[26225.92s -> 26232.32s]  apartment complex. So you'd have Shakespeare, you know, it was it's all like the first and last
[26232.32s -> 26237.20s]  the first letter of their first name, last letter of their last name. So it was like Sean, like
[26238.16s -> 26246.27s]  Harrison, like Andrew, Kennedy. Right. It was it was like eight people.
[26247.15s -> 26254.43s]  Talk to me. And this yelled shit out there with apartment windows to each other.
[26256.35s -> 26262.83s]  You know, it struck me that I've been around you for quite some time now, participating in your
[26262.83s -> 26269.79s]  daily routines. However, I'm not quite sure exactly where we are. Resident sleeper. I'm guessing we
[26269.79s -> 26278.43s]  are somewhere in America, but the details are fuzzy. Like you fuzzy. Anywho, I was wondering
[26278.43s -> 26287.84s]  if you'd be so kind as to tell me which state we're residing in currently. Nevada. We live in the
[26287.84s -> 26297.73s]  Silver State. Yes. That's a great nickname, but I'm assuming they don't exactly handed out as you
[26297.73s -> 26308.91s]  cross the state lines. Anyway, what big city are we nearest to? Las Vegas. Las Vegas, a monument to
[26308.91s -> 26320.48s]  money and decadence. It's truly my kind of city. So do you gamble? Yes. I guess even if you live
[26320.48s -> 26332.90s]  close by, the lure of possible instant riches is always strong. But not very much. No, leave me alone.
[26332.90s -> 26338.74s]  Only enough to have fun and never more than that would seem to be ridiculous. Always moderate
[26338.74s -> 26345.46s]  yourself and don't you go in there and try to have fun with a little bit of a little bit of money.
[26345.46s -> 26350.26s]  You don't blow all your money. It's bad. Have a couple drinks. Maybe play like a few hands of
[26350.26s -> 26356.66s]  blackjack. Maybe spin the roulette once and maybe like a like somewhere like a minimum bed on a
[26356.66s -> 26372.10s]  machine and then you go home. And then before you go home, before the lift gets there, you cancel
[26372.10s -> 26383.79s]  the lift and you turn back and you go to the ATM four times. No, leave me alone. I'm just fucking
[26383.79s -> 26393.46s]  kidding. Relax. I'll be seeing you. Let's talk. Let's talk. I must tell you that your country
[26393.46s -> 26400.02s]  truly fascinates me. Here at the beginning of a new millennium, the most visible signs of change
[26400.02s -> 26405.54s]  for America is that it continues to get stronger and more influential in the world.
[26406.66s -> 26412.34s]  Yet for a country with so much influence, it's made up of so many disparate parts.
[26414.21s -> 26418.61s]  You Westerners seem to live a life that's very different from the rest of the country.
[26418.61s -> 26424.13s]  You're a Westerner too. Somehow everyone fits together. Colonial reachings have even brought
[26424.13s -> 26431.57s]  places like Alaska and Hawaii into the fold. What will your future be like? Will there be 55
[26431.57s -> 26437.97s]  states in a hundred years? Will there be no states at all? These are the things I think about
[26438.77s -> 26452.54s]  and I'm sure you have too. All right, let's heat it up. Let's have a day go by. What does this guy
[26452.54s -> 26458.22s]  think he is? Some kind of fucking improv comedian. You know what I mean? Like snooze. I almost just
[26458.22s -> 26479.14s]  hurt myself with the cord. No spiders? We are so close. It's almost time for the credits.
[26479.14s -> 26482.74s]  They're going to evolve one more time and then we're going to get to see what they do.
[26486.74s -> 26493.68s]  Are you mentally stable? Well, the thing is, if you weren't here about seven and a half hours ago,
[26499.34s -> 26507.74s]  let me get to the right page. Of course I am. I had to do mental preparation before this
[26507.74s -> 26519.87s]  stream started. So yeah, there's a spider in my Dreamcast. I might as well stop the Dreamcast
[26519.87s -> 26549.54s]  then. Thanks for reading me. You're welcome. All right, 27-28. Three more days and we can put the
[26550.74s -> 26562.40s]  book on this one forever. Until C-Man 3 comes out. Read this message. I'm a subscriber.
[26564.43s -> 26581.04s]  I got you, C. Get a Japanese Dreamcast and play the second one? No.
[26583.04s -> 26591.01s]  That would be a very expensive. That would be like 200 bucks just to play C-Man 2.
[26592.62s -> 26597.65s]  Good evening. A Japanese PlayStation 2. I don't have it. I have a region.
[26601.31s -> 26604.59s]  It seems that visiting around this time has become a habit for you.
[26605.23s -> 26610.62s]  Am I going to play Devil May Cry 5? First, a recap of your previous visit.
[26610.62s -> 26622.69s]  Probably soon. The Tad Men have developed legs. At the moment, the habitat contains two Tad Men.
[26625.36s -> 26630.34s]  They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more
[26630.34s -> 26633.86s]  comfortable level. Get one modded for cheaper. So let us head over to the tank.
[26634.90s -> 26646.61s]  Too late. There was a third one. The third one got eaten already. No, there was two. They were two
[26646.61s -> 26662.00s]  there when we left, I think. Stream is still going. Yeah, we're gonna see the end. If you gotta go,
[26662.00s -> 26680.22s]  you gotta go. But I wanna see how this plays out. It's cold, isn't it? You're going really late
[26680.22s -> 26703.55s]  for the East Coast. Yeah, and EU, I know. It is late. It is late. Slow that down. I just got to
[26703.55s -> 26713.65s]  work in the EU. What time is it in EU? 7 a.m.? 8 a.m.? You got work tomorrow and it's 1 a.m.,
[26713.65s -> 26718.85s]  but fuck it. Take care of yourself. Make sure you don't cause yourself any problems, you know?
[26720.64s -> 26735.74s]  Anybody see a spider? I do. He was right about to eat that egg too. Okay, let's continue.
[26736.54s -> 26759.30s]  Hello. How are you? Hey. Yeah? What's up? How are you today? Hi there. Do you have any questions?
[26761.87s -> 26770.69s]  Any questions? Any questions? Look, I'm very busy. Can't this wait?
[26771.89s -> 26785.46s]  Talk to me. Well, I found out a little about you based on where we live. Now I'm curious if you've
[26785.46s -> 26790.42s]  learned anything about your fellow humans based on where they live. Okay. Tell me,
[26790.42s -> 26800.06s]  have you ever traveled abroad? Does Canada count? Does Canada count? No. You know the expression
[26800.06s -> 26807.98s]  about walking a mile in someone's shoes? Well, walking a mile in their country is the next best
[26807.98s -> 26813.02s]  thing. What was that for? You have no idea how much you don't know about a person until you find out
[26813.10s -> 26819.74s]  about their home. Accent. Humans always seem to play it too safe. They stay in their own little
[26819.74s -> 26826.06s]  world instead of realizing that the world belongs to those that live in it. And if you don't travel
[26826.06s -> 26834.06s]  it and learn about it, you're not really living in it, you see? Besides, nothing gets your love
[26834.06s -> 26850.48s]  muffin in the mood for a more quite like an exotic trip. Sure. Sure. This better be good.
[26852.75s -> 26861.87s]  Talk to me. Let's talk. I have another point to make regarding travel and culture.
[26861.87s -> 26869.09s]  Shall I share it with you? Yes. Okay. A lot of just exposition. Whether or not you've traveled
[26869.09s -> 26876.45s]  abroad, you're part of an ever shrinking world. Sure. You know that there's even a song about it
[26876.45s -> 26883.81s]  being a small world after all, but never in history has it become so important to be familiar with
[26883.81s -> 26890.21s]  and tolerant of other peoples and their cultures. You and your descendants will be forced to deal
[26890.21s -> 26897.25s]  more and more with people from all over the world. Think of the effect that will have. Cultures will
[26897.25s -> 26904.13s]  become further mixed. You already see that in small ways like your pop music with musical styles
[26904.13s -> 26911.49s]  being combined in your food with fusion cuisine. It's a natural result of the world's economy
[26911.49s -> 26918.69s]  becoming mixed. The prevalence of the internet, cheaper, faster travel. The end result will more
[26918.69s -> 26924.53s]  likely be that there may be no more countries to speak of in the future. The world will be more
[26924.53s -> 26930.69s]  of a cohesive unit, just as it happened in the United States and is already happening in Europe.
[26931.65s -> 26941.98s]  That to me is very exciting. Exciting. Okay. Globalists.
[26942.78s -> 26950.34s]  Uh, gentlemen, the globalists, let me tell you something. There's going to be a post-post-human,
[26950.34s -> 26958.98s]  post-human apocalypse. I'm telling you, post-human. What's going to happen is the
[26958.98s -> 26966.66s]  sea man are going to come up here and they're going to totally just absolutely wipe us out
[26966.66s -> 26970.82s]  and then the globalists are going to take over with the sea man and then it goes real high.
[26970.82s -> 26985.30s]  It goes real high, Joe. Talk to me. Well, until next time. Bye. No, talk to me. I want to hear
[26985.30s -> 27009.23s]  more. I want to hear more. I'm thinking. Roll credits. Hello. Yes. Talk to me.
[27011.42s -> 27026.38s]  Talk to me. Fine. I'll go talk to your brother. Talk to me. Let's talk. Okay. Let's talk about
[27027.66s -> 27034.32s]  now, maybe tomorrow. Tadpole dropping truth bombs.
[27034.32s -> 27060.86s]  Yes. Fine. We'll talk tomorrow. Not very much time left. Tadpole politics.
[27071.39s -> 27078.51s]  No, guys. Impressions are not politics. They're audio representations
[27079.39s -> 27087.36s]  of what somebody sounds like. Okay. Just remember that. Would you like to
[27088.16s -> 27106.82s]  everything clean? Yeah. Tadpole politics, Andy. Did I just get called politics, Andy? I didn't
[27106.82s -> 27111.63s]  do anything. I'm going to fix this hair. It looks bad after eight hours.
[27115.17s -> 27130.22s]  Politics, Andy. I said like one sentence forehead window. What the fuck does that mean?
[27131.41s -> 27154.59s]  I'm looking that up right now. I don't have, there's nothing here.
[27155.31s -> 27173.34s]  I have three days ago, a teacher told the student to wash off Ash Wednesday on, on forehead.
[27174.22s -> 27180.37s]  What are you talking, what the fuck are you talking about? Why do you keep saying this?
[27181.25s -> 27237.36s]  That's all I could see on like a Google result. Forehead window. That's what I typed in. Get
[27237.36s -> 27302.42s]  bangs. You want to see how fucking bad I look with bangs? Hey, Scoob. How much have you ever
[27302.42s -> 27308.80s]  lost on a coin toss? Could you step outside for me, sir? Could you step outside for me, sir?
[27317.89s -> 27323.33s]  Peasant hair. Okay, that's good. That's really good. Peasant hair.
[27329.25s -> 27342.13s]  It really is. It really is peasant hair. Oh, my father owns farm upside here. Did they,
[27342.13s -> 27348.90s]  how did the farmer, no, how did the peasant talk? Yes, my lord. Yes, right away. Yes,
[27348.90s -> 27359.41s]  right away, my lord. You go shovel that shit in the farmhouse. Yes, right away. Right away.
[27359.41s -> 27372.99s]  Right away, my lord. God fucking damn it. I have peasant hair. I'm shaving it all off.
[27372.99s -> 27387.52s]  It's all going to be gone tomorrow. Witcher 3 peasant NPC. Now it's all fucked up. No, I,
[27389.76s -> 27396.99s]  that's better. No, it's not. Fucking peasant hair. I'm going to look in the mirror every day and
[27396.99s -> 27419.02s]  just think of, I got like a pitchfork, like a beige vest. I had to do the stupid fucking thing
[27420.46s -> 27424.30s]  where I parted in the middle and did the no country for old men impression,
[27425.26s -> 27438.54s]  which sucked on its own. That was bad. Fuck the goddamn face cam. I'm never using it again.
[27443.42s -> 27459.28s]  What would I look like actually completely bald? No, I can't do completely bald, guys.
[27459.28s -> 27465.12s]  I look like a fucking goddamn random British henchman that gets punched in the face first
[27465.12s -> 27487.71s]  in every Liam Neeson movie. I'm not doing it. Grow it out and braid it. No, I can't do that shit.
[27506.32s -> 27530.03s]  Just buzz it. This link, this link. That looks fucking terrible. That was real bad.
[27530.67s -> 27540.26s]  No, I'd rather get a toothpaste staple to my head than look, than have that look. I got too,
[27540.26s -> 27553.55s]  I got too rocky of a face for a bald head. I would rather you use horse glue and it,
[27553.55s -> 27574.75s]  just smear it on there and just let it stay. 329, two more days. Show a screen. Just wait.
[27575.47s -> 27580.91s]  The longer that I get, I lose concentration, the more like terrible fucking ugly impressions you
[27580.91s -> 27602.00s]  get. I don't want that. You don't want that. We both don't want that. I do. Is this a new shirt?
[27602.80s -> 27618.11s]  No, I've had this for a while. Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset.
[27621.02s -> 27628.00s]  Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. Two more days and that's it. At the moment,
[27628.00s -> 27634.00s]  the habitat contains two... Yeah, it's gone. ...Cadmen. I don't want to drink more than one
[27634.72s -> 27638.40s]  Coke a day. They are suffering from the cold. I drink like a Coke maybe in a couple days. I don't
[27638.40s -> 27640.16s]  want to drink my fucking soda every day. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more
[27640.16s -> 27653.10s]  comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank. I love how you're on a PST schedule. I
[27653.10s -> 27656.46s]  appreciate seeing more of you every night. His streams have definitely been longer.
[27657.18s -> 27678.45s]  You're looking extra bald today. I will 1v1 you in auto chess and just show you up. And I
[27678.45s -> 27699.76s]  ain't even ever played it. Have they grown? Not really. Hey. Oh goody. God, they're so ugly.
[27701.81s -> 27707.17s]  All of all three of us or just them two? You got to clarify that. After all this bullshit
[27707.17s -> 27727.01s]  that lasts like 20 minutes. Oh goody. It's about time. Thanks. I believe I'm beginning to... Oh
[27727.01s -> 27733.49s]  jeez. See what happens when you put a... What secrets of the universe are we going to get
[27734.05s -> 27752.26s]  after completing this finally? What was that? Oh, two hatchlings. I'll take them. I'll take
[27752.26s -> 27774.29s]  you, please. Hello. Oh, why did... The face is just so fucked up. They lift their heads up and
[27774.29s -> 27784.13s]  they just look so terrifying. Okay. Coming out on land now. They can come out on land.
[27785.01s -> 27804.72s]  That's new. Talk to me. Let's get some more info. Hi. Let's talk. Hello. Who listening?
[27806.35s -> 27825.12s]  It's good to see you again. You can like Dead Space 2 on me here. Hello. Hello. Let's talk.
[27828.96s -> 27835.28s]  Hey, I have something I want to talk to you about. Okay. You know, I'm really getting the
[27835.28s -> 27842.00s]  impression that you people are busy all the time. Maybe it's just here in America, which is such a
[27842.00s -> 27848.80s]  business obsessed culture. It seems like everyone is always complaining about not having any spare
[27848.88s -> 27854.24s]  time, but when they get some, they don't know what to do with it because they're so used to being
[27854.24s -> 27860.64s]  busy. Okay. It's strange that knowing how to relax appears to have become a skill you humans
[27860.64s -> 27868.48s]  have to learn. You seem to know how to relax if you're talking to me, but I want to know what
[27868.48s -> 27874.48s]  else you do in your spare time. For example, what do you do when you're with your friends?
[27875.36s -> 27890.70s]  The same thing. Play video games. When I ask you something, I expect an answer. You know,
[27890.70s -> 27897.10s]  let us revisit my last inquiry to you. That is, if you can cooperate this time.
[27898.70s -> 27909.60s]  For example, what do you do when you're with your friends? Play video games. Hold on. I've
[27910.56s -> 27937.41s]  got the worst gas. Give me a second. What? Hello? Is he all right? Are you okay? Are you okay?
[27945.60s -> 27959.20s]  Hello? Yeah. Hello. Are you okay? Let me repeat the question. I said, Hey, I have something I want to
[27959.20s -> 27966.08s]  talk to you about. You know, I'm really getting the impression that you people are busy all the
[27966.08s -> 27973.68s]  time. Maybe it's just here in America, which is such a business obsessed culture. It seems like
[27973.68s -> 27979.84s]  everyone is always complaining about not having any spare time, but when they get some, they don't
[27979.84s -> 27985.84s]  know what to do with it because they're so used to being busy. It's strange that knowing how to
[27985.84s -> 27993.49s]  relax appears to have become a skill you humans have to learn. You seem to know how to relax if
[27993.49s -> 27999.81s]  you're talking to me, but I want to know what else you do in your spare time. For example,
[28000.61s -> 28007.97s]  what do you do when you're with your friends? Play video games. Like to toss a few back with
[28007.97s -> 28013.65s]  friends, huh? Yeah. I guess I don't really understand why you humans are so interested
[28013.65s -> 28019.81s]  in destroying your precious brain cells. Just out of curiosity, why do you like to drink?
[28021.09s -> 28031.90s]  Because it's fun. I see. Then the fun starts during the prolonged vomiting into a garbage can.
[28033.10s -> 28042.62s]  You're implying that I drink or drink like 15 beers when I drink. No, you drink a few drinks.
[28043.26s -> 28047.10s]  You have some fun conversation. Maybe you do something fun and that's it.
[28048.06s -> 28054.54s]  Why would you say, okay, yeah, I like to drink. I like to go and have a few drinks with friends.
[28054.54s -> 28062.40s]  It's fun. You're puking. Where did you get the... I don't know where you got that from. Talk to me.
[28067.63s -> 28073.47s]  So I think I have an idea of what activities you and your friends do in your time together.
[28074.27s -> 28081.66s]  Do you see a lot of them, by the way? Not anymore. He's moving. I'm gonna say yes, though.
[28081.66s -> 28087.42s]  Yes. So I see him. Well, that's good. I wouldn't want my little biped to get lonely.
[28091.34s -> 28102.69s]  Talk to me. You know what I've noticed? People love to talk. Oh, sure. There are quiet ones every
[28102.69s -> 28108.85s]  once in a while, but usually if you ask a person the right questions, they can go on for hours.
[28109.57s -> 28115.41s]  I mean, why else would you have me around if you didn't like a good conversation every once in a
[28115.41s -> 28122.45s]  while? I think that's also what makes a good friend. If they're willing to listen to you spout
[28122.45s -> 28129.33s]  off about something, you just have to make sure you let them talk once in a while too so you don't
[28129.33s -> 28136.37s]  bore them to death. But I was wondering what kinds of things do you and your friends talk about?
[28137.17s -> 28154.00s]  TV? I don't know. I don't know. Anything. It could be anything. I don't know what many of my friends talk about.
[28154.00s -> 28158.00s]  It's not like one topic we always discuss.
[28158.00s -> 28160.00s]  Can you give me the answer, please?
[28160.00s -> 28162.00s]  Nobody just talked about one topic.
[28162.00s -> 28166.00s]  You've forgotten, haven't you?
[28167.39s -> 28176.35s]  Okay, then again. But I was wondering what kinds of things do you and your friends talk about?
[28178.10s -> 28186.51s]  Food. Oh, you movie buffs. That's great that you can share a common interest like that, though.
[28187.47s -> 28193.63s]  Movie buffs are a lot like literary buffs. They like to pick apart the things they love and get
[28193.63s -> 28199.71s]  as much out of them as possible. The only drawback is it might be harder to appreciate these things
[28199.71s -> 28207.07s]  once you start dissecting them. I'm sure you know all about that, though. I say you can never really
[28207.07s -> 28214.83s]  get bored if you have someone around who you can talk to. Sometimes it's more fun to just sit around
[28214.83s -> 28221.07s]  and talk than it is to actually go do something. It all depends on the person, though.
[28221.39s -> 28226.06s]  Talk to me.
[28226.06s -> 28241.87s]  Say, I know you spend time socializing with your friends a lot, but you have to have some time left over to spend with your sweetheart, right?
[28241.87s -> 28249.87s]  It's good to be in a relationship that's a friendship, also. You can kill two birds with one stone.
[28249.87s -> 28255.87s]  Besides, I don't know why you'd want to be with someone who bores the pants off you.
[28256.75s -> 28274.32s]  So what do you and your girlfriend like to do together? You know what? Seaman doesn't want to know this.
[28274.32s -> 28281.20s]  Just keep it to yourself. Well, I'm sure you and your sweetie care about each other, but if you don't mind
[28281.20s -> 28288.16s]  me saying so, I think you may have worked yourself into some kind of rut. Maybe you should think about
[28288.32s -> 28296.32s]  getting out more. Exploring your world, that sort of thing. Who knows? Maybe you don't need anything except each other.
[28296.32s -> 28298.32s]  Go jogging!
[28298.32s -> 28302.32s]  Nah, get out and do something before you drive each other crazy.
[28302.32s -> 28304.69s]  Why are you playing facade? This is the original facade.
[28304.69s -> 28309.36s]  Alright, how's the tank?
[28309.36s -> 28319.54s]  One of them's dying.
[28319.54s -> 28341.60s]  Question is who?
[28341.60s -> 28343.60s]  Why am I so slow to respond?
[28343.60s -> 28357.94s]  What do you mean slow to respond?
[28358.10s -> 28361.17s]  What are you guys doing?
[28361.17s -> 28365.25s]  Yes?
[28365.25s -> 28367.25s]  What are you two doing?
[28367.25s -> 28369.25s]  You know what the really great thing about friends is?
[28369.25s -> 28371.25s]  And movies and TV shows.
[28371.25s -> 28373.25s]  Spending time with them makes you really appreciate the time you spend by yourself.
[28373.25s -> 28375.25s]  And books.
[28375.25s -> 28379.25s]  I mean, you probably get tired of your friends sometimes, don't you?
[28379.25s -> 28381.25s]  What do you like to do when you're by yourself?
[28381.25s -> 28389.06s]  Sleep.
[28389.06s -> 28394.30s]  Wow. You sound like you're a thrill a minute.
[28394.30s -> 28396.30s]  It's good that you don't mind being by yourself.
[28396.46s -> 28402.46s]  It seems like a lot of people can't stand it because then they actually have to think.
[28402.46s -> 28406.46s]  I see you don't have that problem.
[28406.46s -> 28409.28s]  What is this guy doing right now?
[28409.28s -> 28413.57s]  This one's freaking me out.
[28413.57s -> 28419.07s]  You guys are just too close. Move out of the way.
[28419.07s -> 28421.07s]  Alright, how are we doing over here?
[28421.07s -> 28432.45s]  We look alright.
[28432.45s -> 28435.90s]  Got a couple more eggs.
[28435.90s -> 28437.90s]  Another day?
[28437.90s -> 28441.62s]  Would you like to s-
[28441.62s -> 28465.47s]  What's the goal of this game?
[28465.63s -> 28468.38s]  What's the goal of this game?
[28468.38s -> 28474.38s]  To raise a tadpole into a frog who eventually implants chips into all humans' brains.
[28474.38s -> 28478.88s]  And forces them to build the pyramids.
[28478.88s -> 28480.88s]  Well, sorry, the new pyramids.
[28480.88s -> 28483.44s]  That's all they care about.
[28483.44s -> 28498.03s]  Free 30.
[28498.03s -> 28500.03s]  20 days exactly, almost 3 weeks.
[28500.03s -> 28512.72s]  This is a lot of passive-aggressive mannerisms to deal with in one night.
[28512.72s -> 28519.12s]  That's the designer's face in the game.
[28519.12s -> 28523.92s]  That's actually-
[28524.08s -> 28526.64s]  That's really funny.
[28526.64s -> 28541.17s]  Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gusset.
[28541.17s -> 28544.37s]  Any changes, Leonard?
[28544.37s -> 28546.37s]  Greetings, and welcome back.
[28546.37s -> 28548.37s]  You're doing a good job.
[28548.37s -> 28553.17s]  Let's see.
[28553.17s -> 28559.17s]  Last time, the tadmen are now closer in appearance to frogs rather than tadpoles.
[28559.17s -> 28561.17s]  Let us then call them frogmen.
[28561.17s -> 28563.17s]  Frogmen.
[28563.17s -> 28566.11s]  That's actually awesome.
[28566.11s -> 28568.11s]  Frogmen.
[28568.27s -> 28570.27s]  To frogmen.
[28570.27s -> 28572.27s]  To frogmen.
[28572.27s -> 28575.60s]  They are suffering from the cold.
[28575.60s -> 28579.60s]  Please use the heater to raise the temperatures to a more comfortable room.
[28579.60s -> 28581.60s]  So what, um...
[28581.60s -> 28583.60s]  What's the final evolution then?
[28587.70s -> 28589.70s]  Do they go from frogmen to lizards?
[28589.70s -> 28591.70s]  What do they go into?
[28591.70s -> 28596.30s]  Birds?
[28596.30s -> 28600.34s]  They don't turn into humans. No, they don't.
[28600.34s -> 28606.99s]  They turn into birds.
[28606.99s -> 28610.70s]  Tadpole, frog, eagle.
[28610.86s -> 28623.07s]  Turn up the heat.
[28623.07s -> 28625.70s]  Oh, goody.
[28625.70s -> 28640.86s]  I'm feeling a little peckish.
[28640.86s -> 28642.86s]  Would you feed me?
[28642.86s -> 28644.86s]  Now they want to eat.
[28644.86s -> 28646.86s]  Okay, I got plenty of food.
[28646.86s -> 28650.62s]  I actually have food for the next at least 10 days.
[28650.62s -> 28652.62s]  This will be good.
[28652.62s -> 28655.69s]  You eat this shit, right?
[28655.69s -> 28657.93s]  What if they didn't eat these anymore?
[28657.93s -> 28660.55s]  Someone over here wants to eat.
[28660.55s -> 28662.55s]  There you go.
[28662.55s -> 28678.22s]  Go get it.
[28678.22s -> 28683.85s]  They don't eat these.
[28684.01s -> 28688.31s]  I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[28688.31s -> 28691.96s]  They eat the moths.
[28691.96s -> 28693.96s]  No, they don't. He's going over there right now.
[28693.96s -> 28698.82s]  Okay.
[28698.82s -> 28701.70s]  Good.
[28701.70s -> 28703.70s]  That was a Campbell's soup reference.
[28703.70s -> 28707.58s]  I think I need some food.
[28707.58s -> 28710.58s]  Instead of one bite, they take a whole thing.
[28710.58s -> 28715.26s]  So.
[28715.26s -> 28717.26s]  Hello. Hello.
[28717.26s -> 28719.26s]  Are you listening?
[28719.26s -> 28726.04s]  I am. How are you?
[28726.20s -> 28733.48s]  Have any questions?
[28733.48s -> 28740.20s]  Bonjour.
[28740.20s -> 28746.15s]  Talk to me.
[28746.15s -> 28753.15s]  One thing I find really interesting about people is how very chameleon-like many of you can be.
[28753.15s -> 28759.15s]  For example, when a person is talking to their closest friends as opposed to their employer,
[28759.15s -> 28762.15s]  their entire persona will often change.
[28762.15s -> 28764.15s]  Of course, it really depends on the person.
[28764.15s -> 28766.15s]  You don't want to get fired.
[28766.31s -> 28770.31s]  You seem to do different things around people than when you're by yourself,
[28770.31s -> 28775.31s]  and that leads me to ask you, depending on who you're with,
[28775.31s -> 28779.31s]  do you think your personality changes a lot?
[28779.31s -> 28781.31s]  A little or not at all?
[28781.31s -> 28783.31s]  A little.
[28783.31s -> 28785.31s]  I think that's pretty common.
[28785.31s -> 28788.31s]  People adapt to the situations around them.
[28788.31s -> 28790.31s]  I'm not going to say the F-word.
[28790.31s -> 28795.31s]  Often, the way you act around your grocery store clerk won't necessitate quite as much ass kissing
[28795.47s -> 28797.47s]  when you're around people you owe money to.
[28797.47s -> 28804.47s]  The things you do with different people and when you're alone reflect your personality changes, I think.
[28804.47s -> 28808.47s]  I mean, it seems like there's a lot of things going on with you.
[28808.47s -> 28812.47s]  No wonder you act differently around different people.
[28812.47s -> 28816.47s]  It seems like you're doing lots of different things around them, too.
[28816.47s -> 28823.47s]  Well, I think I know you well enough to tell you that even I act differently depending on who I'm with,
[28823.63s -> 28825.63s]  and it makes sense.
[28825.63s -> 28829.63s]  Everyone has different expectations of everyone else,
[28829.63s -> 28832.63s]  and nobody expects me to pick my nose around them.
[28832.63s -> 28835.63s]  Yes, that is my private moment.
[28835.63s -> 28837.63s]  Don't tell anyone.
[28837.63s -> 28839.63s]  Hey, thanks for the food.
[28839.63s -> 28843.63s]  It gets really tough for us when the air gets too dry.
[28843.63s -> 28847.63s]  There should be a sprinkler that Gasset built somewhere around here.
[28847.63s -> 28851.63s]  Hey, can you use the D-pad to look for it?
[28851.79s -> 28855.79s]  Come on, use the D-pad and find the sprinkler.
[28855.79s -> 28857.79s]  I'm using the D-pad? What do you mean, the sprinkler?
[28857.79s -> 28860.79s]  Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here.
[28860.79s -> 28871.57s]  There. Is that better?
[28871.57s -> 28874.57s]  Put the light out or I'll put yours out.
[28874.57s -> 28877.87s]  Jesus fucking okay. Oh my god.
[28877.87s -> 28885.62s]  Talk to me. Let's talk.
[28885.62s -> 28887.62s]  That's my name. Don't wear it out.
[28887.62s -> 28889.62s]  What is this? I don't even know what the name is.
[28889.62s -> 28895.04s]  Greg? Hey, Greg. Greg.
[28897.42s -> 28900.42s]  I'm coming, Your Majesty.
[28900.42s -> 28905.42s]  That's a terrifying image.
[28905.42s -> 28914.72s]  Let's talk. Talk to me.
[28914.72s -> 28918.72s]  It's really not a difficult question, I said.
[28918.72s -> 28922.72s]  One thing I find really interesting about people
[28922.72s -> 28926.72s]  is how very chameleon-like many of you can be.
[28926.72s -> 28930.72s]  For example, when a person is talking to their closest friends
[28930.72s -> 28933.72s]  as opposed to their employer,
[28933.88s -> 28936.88s]  your entire persona will often change.
[28936.88s -> 28939.88s]  Of course, it really depends on the person.
[28939.88s -> 28942.88s]  I mean, you seem to do different things around people
[28942.88s -> 28945.88s]  than when you're by yourself and that leads me to ask.
[28945.88s -> 28948.88s]  Did you know you were in the same room standing five feet away from your brother that asked that question?
[28948.88s -> 28951.88s]  Depending on who you're with, do you think your personality changes a lot?
[28951.88s -> 28954.88s]  A little or not at all?
[28954.88s -> 28958.18s]  A little.
[28958.18s -> 28961.18s]  I think that's pretty common. People adapt to the situations around them.
[28961.34s -> 28964.34s]  Often, the way you act around your grocery store clerk
[28964.34s -> 28967.34s]  won't necessitate quite as much ass-kissing
[28967.34s -> 28970.34s]  as when you're around people you owe money to.
[28970.34s -> 28973.34s]  The things you do with different people and when you're alone
[28973.34s -> 28976.34s]  reflect your personality changes, I think.
[28976.34s -> 28980.34s]  I mean, it seems like there's a lot of things going on with you.
[28980.34s -> 28984.34s]  No wonder you act differently around different people.
[28984.34s -> 28988.34s]  It seems like you're doing lots of different things around them too.
[28988.50s -> 28991.50s]  Well, I think I know you well enough to tell you that
[28991.50s -> 28994.50s]  even I act differently depending on who I'm with
[28994.50s -> 28997.50s]  and it makes sense.
[28997.50s -> 29000.50s]  Everyone has different expectations of everyone else
[29000.50s -> 29003.50s]  and nobody expects me to pick my nose around them.
[29003.50s -> 29006.50s]  Yes, that is my private moment.
[29006.50s -> 29009.50s]  Don't tell anyone, please.
[29009.50s -> 29012.50s]  Anyway, I'm going to go think about things for a while.
[29012.50s -> 29015.50s]  It was nice talking with you.
[29015.66s -> 29018.66s]  Bye.
[29018.66s -> 29021.66s]  Bye.
[29021.66s -> 29024.66s]  Why don't you go do something more intellectually stimulating
[29024.66s -> 29027.66s]  like eat paint chips?
[29027.66s -> 29030.66s]  You're dead, don't worry.
[29030.66s -> 29034.16s]  Talk to me. Talk to me.
[29034.16s -> 29043.21s]  Hey, Greg.
[29043.21s -> 29046.90s]  What do you need?
[29046.90s -> 29049.90s]  I see you out there moving from place to place
[29050.06s -> 29053.06s]  and sometimes I am envious of your freedom.
[29053.06s -> 29056.06s]  There are so many things you can do.
[29056.06s -> 29059.06s]  I can imagine what it must be like to be so free.
[29059.06s -> 29062.06s]  It's weird how familiar it seems.
[29062.06s -> 29065.06s]  You must get a lot of exercise
[29065.06s -> 29068.06s]  running around as you do.
[29068.06s -> 29071.06s]  So with all that moving about, do you think you're in pretty good shape?
[29071.06s -> 29074.66s]  No.
[29074.66s -> 29077.66s]  You think you're in pretty bad shape, is that right?
[29077.82s -> 29082.22s]  Yeah.
[29082.22s -> 29085.52s]  I thought you really liked your body.
[29085.52s -> 29088.52s]  Maybe you've just really let yourself go recently
[29088.52s -> 29091.52s]  or maybe you just like your body despite being out of shape.
[29091.52s -> 29094.52s]  I mean, it's not like round
[29094.52s -> 29097.52s]  is necessarily a bad shape.
[29097.52s -> 29100.52s]  You know, circles are round
[29100.52s -> 29103.52s]  and they're great.
[29103.52s -> 29106.52s]  It's hard to say whether or not someone is in good shape.
[29106.68s -> 29109.68s]  It seems like your TV and magazines
[29109.68s -> 29112.68s]  tell you what it means to be fit,
[29112.68s -> 29115.68s]  but that idea of fitness can be pretty unrealistic.
[29115.68s -> 29118.68s]  On the other hand, it's pretty safe to say
[29118.68s -> 29121.68s]  that a little physical activity will make you fitter
[29121.68s -> 29124.68s]  than just sitting around on your butt
[29124.68s -> 29127.68s]  and eating potato chips.
[29127.68s -> 29130.68s]  You don't seem really satisfied with your level of fitness.
[29130.68s -> 29133.68s]  I don't even like potato chips.
[29133.84s -> 29140.52s]  Talk to me.
[29140.52s -> 29148.93s]  What's up?
[29148.93s -> 29151.93s]  It seems strange to me
[29151.93s -> 29154.93s]  that with all the wonderful things you can do with your bodies
[29154.93s -> 29157.93s]  there are still people out there who are out of shape.
[29157.93s -> 29160.93s]  People actually have to make time in their day
[29160.93s -> 29163.93s]  just to exercise.
[29163.93s -> 29166.93s]  And when they do, they do strange useless motions
[29166.93s -> 29169.93s]  over and over that serve no purpose
[29170.09s -> 29173.09s]  to their muscles.
[29173.09s -> 29176.09s]  It seems like such a shame that your world doesn't naturally allow
[29176.09s -> 29179.09s]  for more physical activity.
[29179.09s -> 29182.09s]  You think you're in pretty bad shape, huh?
[29182.09s -> 29185.09s]  Well, what are you doing to get in better shape?
[29185.09s -> 29188.52s]  Nothing.
[29188.52s -> 29191.70s]  Nothing? Really?
[29191.70s -> 29194.70s]  Yeah.
[29194.70s -> 29197.70s]  So I guess you must not really care
[29197.86s -> 29200.86s]  because you seem to be a classic case of cause and effect.
[29200.86s -> 29203.86s]  No exercise, no fitness.
[29203.86s -> 29206.86s]  Who knows?
[29206.86s -> 29209.86s]  Maybe you have a perfect body and are just completely delusional
[29209.86s -> 29212.86s]  but something tells me that if you exercised a little
[29212.86s -> 29215.86s]  you might feel better about yourself.
[29215.86s -> 29218.86s]  I guess I'll have to keep asking you questions
[29218.86s -> 29221.86s]  and see what else I can find out about you.
[29221.86s -> 29227.72s]  Hmm. Number one?
[29227.88s -> 29230.88s]  No, no. It's definitely number two.
[29232.88s -> 29238.81s]  All right. Time for the final day.
[29238.81s -> 29247.28s]  Good night.
[29247.28s -> 29256.41s]  Roast this smug asshole?
[29256.41s -> 29260.22s]  I need to see the final thing.
[29260.22s -> 29266.79s]  We're almost at one of the last...
[29266.79s -> 29270.48s]  There's apparently only two question sets left
[29270.48s -> 29273.98s]  and that's it.
[29273.98s -> 29276.98s]  I'm going to be the only person who's ever beaten
[29277.14s -> 29280.14s]  Seaman on stream.
[29280.14s -> 29283.14s]  On original console, no save stating,
[29283.14s -> 29286.14s]  no fast forwards, no, no.
[29286.14s -> 29289.14s]  Only person on Twitch to have beat it
[29289.14s -> 29303.11s]  with real original hardware on stream.
[29303.11s -> 29308.40s]  I got original shit here.
[29308.40s -> 29326.94s]  Oh, fast, right.
[29326.94s -> 29330.24s]  Would you like to save and end the session?
[29330.24s -> 29333.24s]  You know what I mean though.
[29333.40s -> 29359.86s]  Only goddamn person on this whole site.
[29359.86s -> 29363.67s]  Only fucking person on this site
[29363.67s -> 29367.42s]  that probably owns one of these.
[29367.42s -> 29371.82s]  I might be the only person on the internet
[29371.82s -> 29378.50s]  that still has one. Do you have one?
[29378.50s -> 29385.37s]  You got one of these? With original microphone?
[29385.37s -> 29388.37s]  That was probably up somebody's ass?
[29388.37s -> 29391.86s]  By the way, isn't this supposed to have a thing up here?
[29391.86s -> 29396.19s]  It's supposed to be a little puffball.
[29396.35s -> 29401.38s]  Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.
[29401.38s -> 29404.38s]  Greetings and welcome back.
[29404.38s -> 29410.06s]  You're doing a good job. Very well.
[29410.06s -> 29413.06s]  Ah, you can now use the sprinkler.
[29413.06s -> 29416.06s]  Frogman is sensitive to dryness
[29416.06s -> 29420.26s]  so you must use the sprinkler frequently.
[29420.26s -> 29423.26s]  Is this for PS4? It is not.
[29423.26s -> 29426.26s]  At the moment, the habitat contains
[29426.26s -> 29430.97s]  two frogmen.
[29431.13s -> 29434.30s]  Please use the heater to raise the temperature
[29434.30s -> 29437.30s]  to a more comfortable level.
[29437.30s -> 29441.44s]  So let us head over to the tank.
[29441.44s -> 29444.87s]  Yeah, I'm missing the puffball.
[29444.87s -> 29447.87s]  I'm so ashamed that I put this thing in my mouth
[29447.87s -> 29457.62s]  and pretend up my nose.
[29457.62s -> 29460.62s]  We're in the final set of questions.
[29460.62s -> 29464.76s]  Somebody said three and a half K viewers
[29464.76s -> 29468.38s]  at midnight PST.
[29468.54s -> 29471.98s]  But you're seeing it through like I am.
[29471.98s -> 29486.45s]  Hey, thanks for sticking around.
[29486.45s -> 29489.45s]  Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[29489.45s -> 29492.45s]  There's not enough moisture here.
[29492.45s -> 29495.45s]  I need a little mist here. It's too dry.
[29495.45s -> 29498.45s]  How about turning up the heat?
[29498.45s -> 29501.75s]  Give me something to eat.
[29501.75s -> 29507.68s]  Turn the heat up. Give me something to eat.
[29507.68s -> 29510.68s]  Mist my body.
[29510.84s -> 29518.48s]  Yes, my prince. Anything for you, my prince.
[29518.48s -> 29521.66s]  Hey, can you give me something to eat?
[29521.66s -> 29524.66s]  Could you put the heater on for me?
[29524.66s -> 29527.90s]  You know those things each take time.
[29527.90s -> 29532.53s]  More than ten seconds.
[29532.53s -> 29536.60s]  Could you put the heater on for me?
[29536.60s -> 29539.60s]  I'm really hungry. Please feed me.
[29539.60s -> 29543.48s]  I'm kind of hungry.
[29543.48s -> 29546.48s]  I sure could go for a bite to eat.
[29546.64s -> 29554.36s]  Let's get some food in here.
[29554.36s -> 29559.65s]  I command you to feed me.
[29559.65s -> 29562.65s]  It's like manna from heaven.
[29562.65s -> 29574.77s]  You're such a little dick.
[29574.77s -> 29584.28s]  Imagine being commanded to feed somebody.
[29584.28s -> 29587.46s]  I command you to feed me.
[29587.46s -> 29591.14s]  Hey, thanks for the food.
[29591.14s -> 29600.00s]  Why not?
[29600.00s -> 29604.39s]  So full.
[29604.55s -> 29607.79s]  Oh, fuck it. Who cares?
[29607.79s -> 29612.50s]  We have so much food and we're done.
[29612.50s -> 29617.60s]  I need to bring this over though.
[29617.60s -> 29628.89s]  Why can't I pick anything up?
[29628.89s -> 29634.56s]  Why don't you go rustle me up some grub?
[29634.56s -> 29637.93s]  Can the frog eat?
[29637.93s -> 29640.93s]  The frog, I think, if it eats the spider, will get sick.
[29640.93s -> 29652.66s]  Food over here? Kill the spider.
[29652.66s -> 29655.97s]  I can't. Well, now I can. If he eats, I can kill the spider.
[29656.13s -> 29662.68s]  Right there. Eat it. Eat that bug.
[29662.68s -> 29667.18s]  Hey, you.
[29667.18s -> 29671.88s]  You talking to me or talking to him?
[29671.88s -> 29677.34s]  What do you want? Hi.
[29677.34s -> 29682.06s]  Don't you ever go out on the weekend?
[29682.06s -> 29685.06s]  Hey, thanks.
[29685.06s -> 29693.48s]  That hit the spot.
[29693.48s -> 29702.86s]  They won't eat this, right?
[29702.86s -> 29710.26s]  They shouldn't.
[29710.42s -> 29723.57s]  Talk to me.
[29723.57s -> 29738.90s]  Oh, what are you doing?
[29738.90s -> 29741.90s]  Why did you eat that?
[29741.90s -> 29747.38s]  Did they have to procreate?
[29747.38s -> 29751.58s]  He already ate.
[29751.58s -> 29760.52s]  If they eat, they won't eat it and he'll die.
[29760.52s -> 29765.54s]  I love you.
[29765.54s -> 29768.54s]  I love you.
[29768.54s -> 29772.42s]  I love you.
[29772.58s -> 29775.58s]  I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.
[29775.58s -> 29779.44s]  I love you.
[29779.44s -> 29782.44s]  I'm illin'.
[29782.44s -> 29785.87s]  Yes, I am.
[29785.87s -> 29788.87s]  I'm really not feeling good.
[29788.87s -> 29792.24s]  I love you.
[29792.24s -> 29795.86s]  I love you.
[29795.86s -> 29802.50s]  All we need is one.
[29802.50s -> 29808.47s]  Talk to me. Let's talk.
[29808.47s -> 29811.78s]  You know, I'm really fascinated
[29811.78s -> 29814.78s]  by health clubs and gyms,
[29814.78s -> 29817.78s]  these huge places full of fancy equipment
[29817.78s -> 29820.78s]  and open spaces where you can run around.
[29820.78s -> 29823.78s]  And you have to actually pay to belong to one
[29823.78s -> 29826.78s]  when in the past you could just pick any field
[29826.78s -> 29829.78s]  and run around in it to your heart's content.
[29829.78s -> 29832.78s]  Or you'd get so muscular
[29832.78s -> 29835.78s]  and fit from all the manual labor you'd have to do
[29835.78s -> 29838.78s]  you wouldn't need a special place and time
[29838.78s -> 29841.78s]  just to exercise.
[29841.78s -> 29844.78s]  But I guess the world you live in gives you no other choice.
[29844.78s -> 29847.78s]  So tell me, do you belong to a health club?
[29847.78s -> 29850.95s]  That has to be what's going on.
[29850.95s -> 29854.13s]  No.
[29854.13s -> 29857.13s]  So even though you know you could be more fit,
[29857.13s -> 29860.13s]  you don't want to take the plunge and join a gym?
[29860.13s -> 29863.13s]  It might help, although I guess I can see your hesitation.
[29863.13s -> 29866.13s]  They offer a lot of different activities
[29866.13s -> 29869.13s]  in one convenient place,
[29869.13s -> 29872.13s]  but I just can't help but think a human being
[29872.13s -> 29875.13s]  might want to do something more natural,
[29875.13s -> 29878.13s]  like play a sport or even jog outside
[29878.13s -> 29881.13s]  than be cooped up in a stinky gymnasium
[29881.13s -> 29884.13s]  with a bunch of machines.
[29884.13s -> 29887.13s]  I like to hit the balls in the cages.
[29887.13s -> 29890.13s]  I like to work out nowadays when I haven't done it in about a year.
[29890.13s -> 29898.62s]  Let's talk.
[29898.62s -> 29901.62s]  It seems like there are a lot of different things to keep in mind
[29901.62s -> 29904.62s]  when you're trying to stay in shape.
[29904.62s -> 29907.62s]  Exercising is one of them,
[29907.62s -> 29910.62s]  but eating right is also very important,
[29910.62s -> 29913.62s]  especially where you live.
[29913.62s -> 29916.62s]  There's no shortage of food here, well, for most people,
[29916.62s -> 29919.62s]  and it's very easy to eat too much of the wrong thing, it seems.
[29919.62s -> 29922.62s]  No wonder so many people have problems with their weight.
[29922.62s -> 29925.62s]  Would you say that for the most part
[29925.62s -> 29928.62s]  you eat a pretty healthy diet?
[29928.62s -> 29931.92s]  Yes.
[29931.92s -> 29935.29s]  You do eat healthy? Yes.
[29935.29s -> 29938.29s]  You must really chow down on the vegetables, then.
[29938.29s -> 29941.29s]  What's your favorite one?
[29941.29s -> 29944.29s]  Uh, probably carrots. Carrots.
[29944.29s -> 29947.72s]  Carrots, huh?
[29947.72s -> 29950.72s]  Good as a vegetable, even better as a snowman's nose.
[29950.72s -> 29953.72s]  So versatile.
[29953.72s -> 29956.72s]  It's a shame that the things that are good for you
[29956.72s -> 29959.72s]  don't usually taste as good as the bad ones.
[29959.72s -> 29962.72s]  And you know what? The junk food marketers know it.
[29962.72s -> 29965.72s]  So my advice is, beat the system.
[29965.72s -> 29968.72s]  Eat a pound of broccoli.
[29968.72s -> 29974.58s]  I was pressed for time, and I had to do it.
[29974.58s -> 29979.55s]  I was pressed for time.
[29979.55s -> 29982.55s]  Drinking a fucking coke and eating a whole pizza.
[29983.55s -> 29987.48s]  Let's talk.
[29987.48s -> 29995.33s]  Is he dead yet? Oh, he's getting so red.
[29995.33s -> 29998.63s]  Oh, God.
[29998.63s -> 30003.26s]  This is actually really sad.
[30003.26s -> 30008.02s]  I love you. I love you.
[30008.02s -> 30011.02s]  I'm illin'. Yes, I am.
[30011.02s -> 30015.27s]  Get well soon.
[30015.27s -> 30018.27s]  Ooh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch
[30018.27s -> 30021.27s]  if you know what I mean.
[30021.27s -> 30025.71s]  I love you.
[30025.71s -> 30028.89s]  I'm illin'. Yes, I am.
[30028.89s -> 30033.09s]  Feel better. Feel better.
[30033.09s -> 30038.30s]  I am not. I love you.
[30038.30s -> 30042.29s]  Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[30042.29s -> 30046.10s]  I love you.
[30046.10s -> 30049.10s]  I'm illin'. Yes, I am.
[30049.10s -> 30054.25s]  Let's talk.
[30054.25s -> 30062.35s]  I feel sick. Let's talk.
[30062.35s -> 30066.42s]  End this and go to bed? No, I can't get this far.
[30066.42s -> 30069.42s]  Eight and a half hours into a stream and not see the end of this.
[30069.42s -> 30075.14s]  Let's talk.
[30075.14s -> 30079.33s]  Greg. Cheerio.
[30079.33s -> 30089.59s]  Talk to me. Talk to me.
[30089.59s -> 30092.59s]  You know, I've never been to a place
[30092.59s -> 30095.59s]  that's as diet-obsessed as America.
[30095.59s -> 30098.59s]  It seems like nobody wants to stay healthy the hard way
[30098.59s -> 30101.59s]  to actually exercise and eat right.
[30101.59s -> 30104.59s]  Instead, people are always looking
[30104.59s -> 30107.59s]  for a quick and easy way to lose a bunch of weight
[30107.59s -> 30110.59s]  as if they're just automatically going to stay healthy
[30110.59s -> 30113.59s]  after the diet is over. Right.
[30113.59s -> 30116.59s]  It looks like you take pretty regular care of yourself anyway,
[30116.59s -> 30119.59s]  but have you ever been on a diet?
[30119.59s -> 30123.02s]  Wait, hold on, that's... No.
[30123.02s -> 30126.02s]  Not in that context. Maybe that's for the best.
[30126.02s -> 30129.58s]  It looks like you're already trying to straighten out your health
[30129.58s -> 30132.58s]  without resorting to lose-weight quick-skis.
[30132.58s -> 30140.46s]  No. Talk to me.
[30140.46s -> 30143.46s]  I was thinking earlier about how interested
[30143.46s -> 30146.46s]  your culture is in sports.
[30146.46s -> 30149.46s]  I would say even obsessed sometimes.
[30149.46s -> 30152.46s]  It can really get out of hand,
[30152.46s -> 30155.46s]  but now that we're talking about health and staying fit,
[30155.46s -> 30158.46s]  it almost doesn't seem like such a bad thing.
[30158.46s -> 30161.46s]  That is, if you're actually playing a sport
[30161.46s -> 30164.46s]  and not sitting in front of a TV and watching someone else play it,
[30164.46s -> 30167.46s]  tell me, what's your favorite sport to play?
[30167.46s -> 30170.46s]  Tom Brady. Baseball.
[30170.46s -> 30173.77s]  You play baseball?
[30173.77s -> 30177.33s]  Yes. I bet you just like wearing
[30177.33s -> 30180.33s]  those tight little pants.
[30180.33s -> 30183.33s]  I think I understand why people want to play sports.
[30183.33s -> 30186.33s]  It must be fun to see
[30186.33s -> 30189.33s]  what you can make your body do if you just try a little,
[30189.33s -> 30192.33s]  and you also get to hang out with other people
[30192.33s -> 30195.33s]  and test your skills against theirs.
[30195.33s -> 30198.33s]  I guess I still think some people
[30198.33s -> 30201.33s]  can get too interested in sports,
[30201.33s -> 30204.33s]  especially if it interferes with the mental stimulation they get.
[30204.33s -> 30207.33s]  As with most things,
[30207.33s -> 30211.08s]  balance is the key.
[30211.08s -> 30214.08s]  What are you guys saying? There's a fly in your room
[30214.08s -> 30217.32s]  flying around your face? What are you talking about?
[30221.18s -> 30226.14s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[30226.14s -> 30238.59s]  Did somebody just join the stream?
[30238.59s -> 30241.59s]  Watch out, there's a fly.
[30241.59s -> 30244.59s]  Here it comes.
[30244.59s -> 30247.83s]  Talk to me.
[30247.83s -> 30253.17s]  Talk to me. Let's talk.
[30253.17s -> 30257.43s]  Let's talk. What do you mean, here it comes?
[30257.43s -> 30265.07s]  Here it comes. You just throw shit at me?
[30265.07s -> 30268.31s]  You just throw shit at my screen!
[30268.31s -> 30282.99s]  Get well soon.
[30282.99s -> 30286.30s]  I really don't feel very well.
[30286.30s -> 30289.92s]  Get well soon.
[30289.92s -> 30295.02s]  I'm illin'. Yes, I am.
[30295.02s -> 30298.94s]  Let's talk.
[30298.94s -> 30301.94s]  I really don't feel very well.
[30301.94s -> 30305.95s]  Greg, let's talk.
[30305.95s -> 30311.69s]  Fine. You're a pain in the ass. How's that?
[30311.69s -> 30316.14s]  Wow. Now that's dark.
[30316.14s -> 30324.55s]  Turn the light on.
[30324.55s -> 30328.11s]  Hey, turn on the light. Ah, it's too bright.
[30328.11s -> 30336.33s]  Talk to me.
[30336.33s -> 30339.33s]  I was thinking earlier about sports
[30339.33s -> 30342.33s]  and how popular they are here.
[30342.33s -> 30345.33s]  As I was saying, it would be really great
[30345.33s -> 30348.33s]  for the collective health of the country
[30348.33s -> 30351.33s]  if everyone played sports, but
[30351.33s -> 30354.50s]  it doesn't do so much for you to just sit and watch them.
[30354.50s -> 30357.50s]  I'm fascinated with watching other people play sports.
[30357.50s -> 30360.50s]  Being a spectator.
[30360.50s -> 30363.50s]  Do you follow any professional sports?
[30363.50s -> 30369.48s]  League of Legends.
[30369.48s -> 30372.48s]  Well, you're a rare specimen.
[30372.48s -> 30375.48s]  You play sports, but you don't follow the pros.
[30375.48s -> 30378.78s]  It's definitely the healthier way to go.
[30378.78s -> 30381.78s]  Anyhow, thanks for playing.
[30381.78s -> 30391.42s]  Cloud 9 will win again.
[30391.42s -> 30396.38s]  Talk to me. Talk to me.
[30396.38s -> 30402.82s]  I've been asking you a lot about your health
[30402.82s -> 30405.82s]  and it seems that working out
[30405.82s -> 30408.82s]  and eating right are two big components of it all.
[30408.82s -> 30411.82s]  This game is louder than your voice.
[30411.82s -> 30414.82s]  Oh, it's because I am leaning back and talking into this microphone.
[30414.82s -> 30417.82s]  But it seems that your human body
[30417.82s -> 30420.82s]  is still so delicate.
[30420.82s -> 30423.82s]  All the working out and dieting in the world
[30423.82s -> 30426.82s]  make sure that something won't just go wrong anyway.
[30426.82s -> 30429.82s]  That's where your physicians come in.
[30429.82s -> 30432.82s]  Do you go to the doctor regularly?
[30432.82s -> 30435.82s]  Literally was there like fucking
[30435.82s -> 30438.82s]  very, very recently, yes.
[30438.82s -> 30441.82s]  That's to your benefit.
[30441.82s -> 30444.82s]  Besides, it's another excuse to get naked.
[30444.82s -> 30447.82s]  My, I am behaving saucily today, aren't I?
[30447.82s -> 30450.82s]  Human beings are very lucky
[30450.82s -> 30453.82s]  to have figured out how to heal themselves
[30453.82s -> 30456.82s]  when they get sick.
[30456.82s -> 30459.82s]  No other creature can do that.
[30459.82s -> 30462.82s]  It's easy to take all your medical knowledge for granted,
[30462.82s -> 30465.82s]  but think about it.
[30465.82s -> 30468.82s]  If you were living even several hundred years ago,
[30468.82s -> 30471.82s]  you'd still be putting leeches on yourself
[30471.82s -> 30474.82s]  whenever you got a cold.
[30474.82s -> 30477.82s]  Not that leeches are such a bad thing,
[30477.82s -> 30480.82s]  but they're actually what I would call good medicine.
[30480.82s -> 30483.82s]  Anyway, I'm glad to know
[30483.82s -> 30486.82s]  that if something goes wrong with you,
[30486.82s -> 30492.81s]  there's somebody that can help you out.
[30492.81s -> 30495.81s]  Your brother is over there suffering.
[30495.81s -> 30501.40s]  I don't know what to do about him.
[30501.40s -> 30507.07s]  Talk to me. Talk to me.
[30507.07s -> 30510.07s]  Like I was saying earlier,
[30510.07s -> 30513.07s]  it's important to go to the doctor every once in a while,
[30513.07s -> 30516.07s]  because it's so easy to do,
[30516.07s -> 30519.07s]  since healthcare can be so expensive.
[30519.07s -> 30522.07s]  I'm fascinated by this idea of health insurance.
[30522.07s -> 30525.07s]  Well, actually, I find it a little sad.
[30525.07s -> 30528.07s]  You humans are so sure that someday
[30528.07s -> 30531.07s]  you're going to get sick that you actually
[30531.07s -> 30534.07s]  put money away, especially for that time.
[30534.07s -> 30537.07s]  There's no escaping it, I guess.
[30537.07s -> 30540.07s]  Do you have health insurance?
[30540.07s -> 30543.70s]  I see.
[30543.70s -> 30546.70s]  Well, if you do, I guess you might as well
[30546.70s -> 30549.70s]  make good use of it.
[30549.70s -> 30552.70s]  That didn't come out exactly right, but you know what I mean.
[30552.70s -> 30556.26s]  Do you get sick a lot?
[30556.26s -> 30559.26s]  No, but I do have a lot of health problems.
[30559.26s -> 30562.26s]  I don't really get a cold,
[30562.26s -> 30576.30s]  but I've got a shitload of health problems.
[30576.30s -> 30582.98s]  I think he's dead. You good?
[30582.98s -> 30586.92s]  Oh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch,
[30586.92s -> 30591.12s]  if you know what I mean.
[30591.12s -> 30594.74s]  Get well soon.
[30594.74s -> 30597.74s]  Oh, I really don't feel very well.
[30597.74s -> 30601.18s]  Don't come over here and eat him.
[30601.18s -> 30604.18s]  This is poisoned meat. Don't do it.
[30604.18s -> 30607.18s]  Don't stick that fucking elephant trunk
[30607.18s -> 30610.18s]  into this and start sucking. Don't do it.
[30610.18s -> 30618.09s]  Bad idea.
[30618.09s -> 30628.21s]  Okay, good.
[30628.21s -> 30631.58s]  Another day.
[30631.58s -> 30637.87s]  Still got plenty of food.
[30637.87s -> 30640.87s]  Our food supply is doing good. No more spider.
[30640.87s -> 30644.75s]  We should have another larva tomorrow.
[30644.75s -> 30660.46s]  Let's go.
[30660.46s -> 30675.34s]  How can I be expected to sleep when this nightmare is on?
[30675.34s -> 30682.34s]  One more day. Is it my bedtime yet?
[30682.34s -> 30687.25s]  No, I'm just going.
[30687.25s -> 30690.49s]  Oh, shit. We're going into April.
[30690.49s -> 30696.22s]  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Go back.
[30696.22s -> 30702.54s]  We're going into April 1st.
[30702.54s -> 30710.26s]  4-1-2019. That's correct, right? 31? Yeah.
[30710.26s -> 30732.73s]  I'm going until I see the credits.
[30732.73s -> 30738.27s]  He doesn't know. What?
[30738.27s -> 30741.27s]  No, I was explicitly told that we only had
[30741.27s -> 30756.59s]  a couple more sequences left.
[30764.62s -> 30769.34s]  At the moment, the habitat contains
[30769.34s -> 30772.64s]  two frogmen.
[30772.64s -> 30777.48s]  Seaman has become ill after eating a spider.
[30777.48s -> 30780.48s]  Please take good care of him.
[30780.48s -> 30783.48s]  Some kind words of encouragement may help him feel better.
[30783.48s -> 30786.48s]  So let us head over to the tank.
[30786.48s -> 30791.13s]  Alright, this says 25 hours,
[30791.13s -> 30795.57s]  but what you have to understand is
[30795.57s -> 30798.87s]  one person, only one person,
[30798.87s -> 30814.13s]  reported this.
[30814.13s -> 30817.13s]  So that's it.
[30817.13s -> 30823.12s]  One guy probably left his Dreamcast on for 10 hours.
[30823.12s -> 30826.12s]  He left 5 hours ago and this guy is still streaming this game.
[30826.12s -> 30835.38s]  Laughing my ass off.
[30835.38s -> 30843.78s]  So how long is the game if you cheat?
[30843.78s -> 30846.78s]  I have no idea.
[30846.78s -> 30849.78s]  Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?
[30849.78s -> 30852.78s]  I need a little mist here. It's too dry.
[30852.78s -> 30855.78s]  How you doing?
[30855.78s -> 30858.78s]  It still looks kind of like shit.
[30858.78s -> 30866.89s]  It's cold in here, just like my Harlem days.
[30866.89s -> 30872.11s]  Thanks for the moisture.
[30872.11s -> 30883.74s]  See that gray square thing in the back corner?
[30883.74s -> 30886.74s]  That's a heater.
[30886.74s -> 30893.62s]  In the lore, seaman species are
[30893.62s -> 30896.62s]  omnipotent messengers of the gods.
[30896.62s -> 30899.62s]  The eggs come from Egypt, which is maybe why they have a thing
[30899.62s -> 30902.62s]  for the pyramids. I see.
[30902.62s -> 30905.62s]  Why don't you give me something to eat?
[30905.62s -> 30910.77s]  Do you eat if you're sick?
[30910.77s -> 30915.29s]  It's going to be too hot. I didn't stop the wheel fast enough.
[30915.29s -> 30919.15s]  Maybe I did. I did.
[30919.15s -> 30926.94s]  Okay, let's see. Food. How are we doing? Spiders?
[30926.94s -> 30930.18s]  I don't see any. There are...
[30930.18s -> 30933.18s]  I'm going to leave that one. That one looks cool.
[30933.18s -> 30936.74s]  That one's getting big and fat.
[30936.74s -> 30940.49s]  I need two. Come over here.
[30940.49s -> 30943.49s]  He can't move though. Can he not? I don't think I can
[30943.49s -> 30946.49s]  feed him. I can't drop it over here.
[30946.49s -> 30953.36s]  How is he going to get better?
[30953.36s -> 30958.78s]  I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[30958.78s -> 30969.94s]  I'm not sure I can feed this one.
[30969.94s -> 30972.94s]  That hit the spot. Good to hear.
[30972.94s -> 30978.14s]  Let's take another fresh one over there.
[30978.14s -> 30981.14s]  No thanks. I'm not hungry now.
[30981.14s -> 30986.16s]  What? Are you hungry?
[30986.16s -> 30989.16s]  Maybe I could eat a little antacid, but that's it.
[30989.16s -> 30992.16s]  I really don't know what I ate that made me this way.
[30992.16s -> 30995.40s]  You don't want it then?
[30995.40s -> 31003.81s]  Did I seriously just waste this?
[31003.81s -> 31007.99s]  Let's talk.
[31007.99s -> 31014.74s]  Greg, come here.
[31014.74s -> 31017.74s]  Hello? Are you listening?
[31017.74s -> 31021.10s]  Talk to me. Yes, let's talk.
[31021.10s -> 31029.50s]  Good evening. Hi.
[31029.50s -> 31032.50s]  Okay, I've got something to tell you.
[31032.50s -> 31035.50s]  See, I've been lying to you all this time.
[31035.50s -> 31038.50s]  I'm actually Regis Philbin and if you kiss me
[31038.50s -> 31042.06s]  I'll become human again and give you a million dollars.
[31042.06s -> 31045.06s]  April Fools.
[31045.06s -> 31048.06s]  You believed me, didn't you? That's why.
[31048.06s -> 31051.62s]  Quick. Help. There's a shark in here.
[31051.62s -> 31055.43s]  Help. Gotcha.
[31055.43s -> 31059.18s]  April Fools.
[31059.18s -> 31064.65s]  Pretty good. Talk to me.
[31064.65s -> 31072.11s]  So, we've been talking a lot about the health of your body.
[31072.11s -> 31075.11s]  That's of course quite important,
[31075.11s -> 31078.11s]  but it also helps to have a healthy mind.
[31078.11s -> 31081.11s]  So, to that end,
[31081.11s -> 31084.11s]  have you ever gone to a therapist?
[31084.11s -> 31088.04s]  No.
[31088.04s -> 31091.04s]  It seems that a lot of people think that
[31091.04s -> 31094.04s]  seeing their mental health through the efforts of a therapist
[31094.04s -> 31097.04s]  is a sign of weakness. Yet most people
[31097.04s -> 31100.04s]  don't see going to the doctor for a physical ailment
[31100.04s -> 31103.04s]  as a sign of weakness.
[31103.04s -> 31106.04s]  Strange how people think sometimes.
[31106.04s -> 31109.04s]  I hope if you ever feel you have a problem
[31109.04s -> 31112.04s]  you can't handle, you'll consider seeing a therapist.
[31112.04s -> 31115.04s]  Or you can just come talk to me.
[31115.04s -> 31118.04s]  At least I won't charge you.
[31118.04s -> 31121.04s]  Much.
[31121.04s -> 31124.04s]  By far the most mysterious part of your human body
[31124.04s -> 31127.04s]  is the brain.
[31127.04s -> 31130.04s]  Even your greatest scientists will freely admit
[31130.04s -> 31133.04s]  that they barely know anything about how it works.
[31133.04s -> 31136.04s]  And yet, when something is wrong in your head
[31136.04s -> 31139.04s]  I'll bet it hurts just as much as a wound
[31139.04s -> 31142.04s]  or a disease.
[31142.04s -> 31145.04s]  I hope you take care of your mind as well as you take care of your body.
[31145.04s -> 31148.04s]  Or better, since you don't seem to be too keen
[31148.04s -> 31151.04s]  on keeping your body tip-top.
[31151.04s -> 31160.47s]  Talk to me.
[31160.47s -> 31164.27s]  What do you want?
[31164.27s -> 31167.27s]  Let's talk. I feel like I've said that 5,000 times this dream.
[31167.27s -> 31172.48s]  Let's talk. Talk to me.
[31172.48s -> 31176.62s]  Yes?
[31176.62s -> 31183.49s]  Talk to me. Let's chat. Can we talk?
[31183.49s -> 31189.03s]  Well, thanks for letting me in on some of your
[31189.03s -> 31192.03s]  health secrets.
[31192.03s -> 31195.03s]  All of us animals have these fragile, organic
[31195.03s -> 31198.03s]  bodies that break down and cause us pain.
[31198.03s -> 31201.03s]  But human beings are especially fascinating
[31201.03s -> 31204.03s]  because they can actually prevent or cure
[31204.03s -> 31207.03s]  so many of the body's problems.
[31207.03s -> 31210.03s]  That's why I wanted to know what you do to keep yourself
[31210.03s -> 31213.03s]  healthy. I want to know how you humans
[31213.03s -> 31216.03s]  take advantage of their medical knowledge.
[31217.03s -> 31220.03s]  Some people take it all for granted
[31220.03s -> 31223.03s]  and do stupid, destructive things to their bodies
[31223.03s -> 31226.03s]  just because they're used to having the means to recover.
[31226.03s -> 31229.21s]  Well, anyway,
[31229.21s -> 31232.21s]  I think I'm going to go take a little rest.
[31232.21s -> 31235.21s]  I don't want to over-exert myself.
[31235.21s -> 31238.21s]  I'll talk to you later.
[31238.21s -> 31241.21s]  There we go. Alright.
[31241.21s -> 31244.21s]  Only another day or two. Maybe.
[31244.21s -> 31252.49s]  Let's talk. Talk to me.
[31252.49s -> 31270.58s]  Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow.
[31270.58s -> 31274.78s]  Will you eat? Will you eat?
[31274.78s -> 31279.73s]  Please eat.
[31279.73s -> 31282.73s]  I think I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.
[31282.73s -> 31287.95s]  Get well soon.
[31287.95s -> 31292.65s]  I feel sick.
[31292.65s -> 31298.70s]  Let's check all the bugs. Any spiders? I don't think so.
[31298.70s -> 31301.88s]  Yeah, fuck it. We're leaving the spiders in here.
[31301.88s -> 31306.78s]  I got so much food.
[31306.78s -> 31309.78s]  Look at this shit. I got one, two, three, four.
[31309.78s -> 31313.66s]  I have at least three more days' worth of food.
[31313.66s -> 31318.76s]  At least three or four days with food.
[31318.76s -> 31333.90s]  We have to talk about religion and then politics
[31333.90s -> 31339.45s]  and then that's it.
[31339.45s -> 31351.58s]  It's just Simpsons hit and run all over again.
[31351.58s -> 31358.15s]  Oh, God. The no-no topic.
[31358.15s -> 31376.05s]  I just hurt my arm.
[31376.05s -> 31379.05s]  What do you mean politics? Are they going to ask me how I
[31379.05s -> 31388.75s]  glean politically?
[31388.75s -> 31391.75s]  So, are you a Democrat or a Republican
[31391.75s -> 31394.99s]  or something else?
[31394.99s -> 31405.90s]  I'm just going to mute the stream. It's going to be a black screen.
[31405.90s -> 31410.29s]  Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory
[31410.29s -> 31415.38s]  of Jean Paul Gasset.
[31415.38s -> 31418.38s]  There is a definite pattern to your visits.
[31418.38s -> 31421.38s]  It appears you are a punctual person.
[31421.38s -> 31424.38s]  At the moment, the habitat contains
[31424.38s -> 31429.22s]  two frogmen.
[31429.22s -> 31432.22s]  Seaman has become ill after eating a spider.
[31432.22s -> 31435.22s]  Please take good care of him.
[31435.22s -> 31438.22s]  Some kind words of encouragement may help him feel better.
[31438.22s -> 31444.47s]  So, let us head over to the tank.
[31444.47s -> 31448.42s]  I'm going to give cartoon responses.
[31448.42s -> 31451.42s]  Do you understand? I'm going to give
[31451.42s -> 31454.72s]  bullshit dumb cartoon responses.
[31454.72s -> 31457.72s]  What do you belong to for a party?
[31457.72s -> 31460.72s]  I'm just going to say a mashed potato party.
[31460.72s -> 31463.72s]  You ain't going to get shit this stream.
[31463.72s -> 31485.76s]  Jerma is a communist.
[31485.76s -> 31489.00s]  How do you roll your eyes?
[31489.00s -> 31493.46s]  Can I not roll my eyes?
[31493.46s -> 31496.46s]  I need a little mist here. It's too dry.
[31496.46s -> 31499.46s]  Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?
[31499.46s -> 31502.46s]  If I weren't in a tank, I swear there was a draft.
[31502.46s -> 31508.32s]  Just like my Harlem days,
[31508.32s -> 31515.02s]  I thought I was going to shrivel up and die.
[31515.02s -> 31526.58s]  I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.
[31526.58s -> 31529.58s]  I love you. I love you. I love you.
[31529.58s -> 31533.06s]  I love you.
[31533.06s -> 31536.66s]  He don't care. Whatever. Fuck it.
[31536.66s -> 31539.97s]  Hello. Are you listening?
[31539.97s -> 31549.16s]  There is such a good Rick and Morty
[31549.16s -> 31552.16s]  bit about politics. I'm just going to say it verbatim
[31552.16s -> 31555.16s]  to the frogs.
[31555.16s -> 31558.85s]  Oh, goody.
[31558.85s -> 31561.85s]  Excuse me, but my stomach is empty.
[31561.85s -> 31572.83s]  I know you're hungry.
[31572.83s -> 31576.78s]  You know I could really eat.
[31576.78s -> 31585.87s]  I feel terrible.
[31585.87s -> 31590.58s]  Oh, yummy, baity goodness.
[31590.58s -> 31597.15s]  You're learning so many ways to say that you're hungry.
[31597.15s -> 31600.15s]  That was tasty.
[31600.15s -> 31606.26s]  What are you doing?
[31606.26s -> 31609.26s]  Hey, what's he doing? Is he throwing up blood?
[31609.26s -> 31636.85s]  You saw that, right? Thotty.
[31636.85s -> 31640.66s]  Don't touch him. Don't. Don't. Get away from my moth.
[31640.66s -> 31646.40s]  I fucking hate the spiders. I have enough food.
[31646.40s -> 31651.18s]  I do. How am I going to get rid of you?
[31651.18s -> 31660.61s]  I got. I don't think. What do I do about this?
[31660.61s -> 31664.87s]  I think I just. That was fucked up.
[31664.87s -> 31668.43s]  I don't know what to do. I cannot put the spider in the matrix
[31668.43s -> 31672.95s]  I can only go here or here. I'm just going to leave it.
[31672.95s -> 31677.54s]  Unfortunately, I got plenty of food, I think,
[31677.54s -> 31681.54s]  to molest to the end of the game.
[31681.54s -> 31689.12s]  Get both the frogs sick. No, I'm not going to do that.
[31689.12s -> 31693.38s]  All right, let's go. Ooh, he's not sick anymore.
[31693.38s -> 31699.57s]  Let's talk politics. Talk to me.
[31699.57s -> 31703.32s]  I feel sick. No, not you, the healthy one.
[31703.32s -> 31713.39s]  Hey, listen up. Let's talk.
[31713.39s -> 31720.98s]  Good evening. Talk to me.
[31720.98s -> 31729.89s]  Let's talk. Talk to me.
[31729.89s -> 31733.13s]  No, I'm not talking about you.
[31733.13s -> 31738.93s]  I'm about to pick you up and just throw you.
[31738.93s -> 31744.73s]  Talk to me.
[31744.73s -> 31747.73s]  Hey, there are laws against that sort of thing.
[31747.73s -> 31751.61s]  Get well soon.
[31751.61s -> 31754.61s]  I'm illin'. Yes, I am.
[31754.61s -> 31759.05s]  Get well soon.
[31759.05s -> 31762.35s]  Really don't feel very well.
[31762.35s -> 31765.78s]  Come here. Greg, come here.
[31765.78s -> 31769.84s]  Make me. I'm telling you,
[31769.84s -> 31772.84s]  you're causing a lot of problems. Let's talk.
[31772.84s -> 31781.36s]  Let's talk. Finally.
[31781.36s -> 31784.36s]  You know, I've been around you humans for a long time now,
[31784.36s -> 31787.36s]  and it seems like every group of people,
[31787.36s -> 31790.36s]  every country, state, and kingdom...
[31790.36s -> 31793.36s]  Here we go. ...has a different way of setting up its government.
[31793.36s -> 31796.36s]  Sometimes one person has all the power,
[31796.36s -> 31799.36s]  sometimes everyone shares the power.
[31799.36s -> 31802.36s]  It seems like there are as many different types of governments
[31802.36s -> 31805.36s]  as there are people in the world.
[31805.36s -> 31808.36s]  Human politics is very interesting to me,
[31808.36s -> 31811.36s]  which is why I am very curious.
[31811.36s -> 31814.36s]  You're breaking my second rule.
[31814.36s -> 31817.36s]  As you are currently residing in a democratic society,
[31817.36s -> 31820.36s]  are you taking advantage of your power?
[31820.36s -> 31823.36s]  What I mean is,
[31823.36s -> 31826.36s]  are you registered to vote?
[31826.36s -> 31833.50s]  No, not here.
[31833.50s -> 31837.00s]  So you're not a voter, is that right?
[31837.00s -> 31840.00s]  No, I am a voter. I just moved.
[31840.00s -> 31843.00s]  Hmm, that's interesting.
[31843.00s -> 31846.00s]  I would think that you'd like the power a vote would give you,
[31846.00s -> 31849.00s]  but maybe I'm projecting.
[31849.00s -> 31852.00s]  I'm not registered to vote in Nevada.
[31852.00s -> 31856.39s]  No, I'm not.
[31856.39s -> 31867.04s]  Talk to me. Talk to me.
[31867.04s -> 31875.06s]  What's up?
[31875.06s -> 31882.14s]  Let's talk.
[31882.14s -> 31885.14s]  I'm still thinking about this government of yours.
[31885.14s -> 31888.14s]  I mean, with everybody's different ideas of how to run things,
[31888.14s -> 31891.14s]  how do you ever agree on anything?
[31891.14s -> 31894.14s]  You seem to have a few major belief groups
[31894.14s -> 31897.14s]  that most people fall into,
[31897.14s -> 31900.14s]  like the Republicans and the Democrats,
[31900.14s -> 31903.14s]  but I'll bet not everybody in your country
[31903.14s -> 31906.14s]  falls into one of those, right?
[31906.14s -> 31909.14s]  I guess it's just a matter of which group has more supporters.
[31909.14s -> 31912.83s]  If I had to guess,
[31912.83s -> 31915.83s]  I'd say you are a Democrat.
[31915.83s -> 31950.37s]  Talk to me.
[31950.37s -> 31956.55s]  Okay, one more time.
[31956.55s -> 31959.55s]  I said I'm still thinking about this government of yours.
[31959.55s -> 31962.55s]  Fuck!
[31962.55s -> 31965.55s]  I'm trying to skip it.
[31965.55s -> 31968.55s]  How do you ever agree on anything?
[31968.55s -> 31971.55s]  You seem to have a few major belief groups
[31971.55s -> 31974.55s]  that most people fall into,
[31974.55s -> 31977.55s]  like the Republicans and the Democrats,
[31977.55s -> 31980.55s]  but I'll bet not everybody in your country
[31980.55s -> 31983.55s]  falls into one of those, right?
[31983.55s -> 31986.55s]  I guess it's just a matter of which group
[31986.55s -> 31990.50s]  has more supporters.
[31990.50s -> 31993.50s]  I guess I'd say you are a Democrat.
[31993.50s -> 32029.12s]  Am I right?
[32029.12s -> 32035.11s]  Hey, everybody! Welcome to the stream!
[32035.11s -> 32046.00s]  What do you want?
[32046.00s -> 32049.75s]  Let's talk. Let's talk. Talk to me.
[32049.75s -> 32055.54s]  I'm ready to fucking mute it. You think I'm ready?
[32055.54s -> 32063.19s]  Yes. Talk to me. Let's talk.
[32063.19s -> 32066.19s]  You know, I'm rather curious about your general stance
[32066.19s -> 32069.19s]  about your political system.
[32069.19s -> 32072.19s]  I believe in it.
[32072.19s -> 32075.19s]  I mean, does it really make any difference
[32075.19s -> 32078.19s]  which candidate one person votes for?
[32078.19s -> 32081.19s]  All of your politicians are basically the same anyway.
[32081.19s -> 32084.19s]  What's the difference between rich middle-aged white man A
[32084.19s -> 32087.19s]  and rich middle-aged white man B?
[32087.19s -> 32090.19s]  About the most variety you could hope for
[32090.19s -> 32093.19s]  is a very rich middle-aged white man
[32093.19s -> 32096.19s]  or maybe a rich old white man.
[32096.19s -> 32099.19s]  Okay, let's just say there is a difference
[32099.19s -> 32102.19s]  just for the sake of argument.
[32102.19s -> 32105.19s]  Would it matter then who one person voted for?
[32105.19s -> 32108.19s]  After all, it's just one voice in a country
[32108.19s -> 32111.19s]  of millions and millions.
[32111.19s -> 32114.19s]  Yes. Everybody has a voice. Everybody has an opinion.
[32114.19s -> 32118.84s]  Everybody has an opinion. Everybody has a voice.
[32118.84s -> 32121.84s]  Everybody has an opinion. Everybody has a voice.
[32121.84s -> 32124.84s]  Boy, do I have to dump.
[32124.84s -> 32127.84s]  You can't just go from...you can't just shit in my face
[32127.84s -> 32130.84s]  after talking about...I guess it actually is a perfect place
[32130.84s -> 32133.84s]  for you to do that, actually.
[32133.84s -> 32136.84s]  Us talking politics is the absolute perfect opportunity for you to do that.
[32136.84s -> 32146.64s]  Okay. Talk to me. Let's talk.
[32146.64s -> 32149.64s]  You know, I'll bet you're not really interested
[32149.64s -> 32152.64s]  in politics anyway.
[32152.64s -> 32155.64s]  And I'll bet you're wishing I'd just shut up
[32155.64s -> 32158.64s]  and talk about sex or something you're really interested in.
[32158.64s -> 32161.64s]  Do it right now. Yes.
[32161.64s -> 32164.64s]  But you tell me.
[32164.64s -> 32168.84s]  Are you interested in politics at all?
[32168.84s -> 32171.84s]  For the purpose of this. For the purpose of this fucking screen.
[32171.84s -> 32175.46s]  No.
[32175.46s -> 32178.46s]  So you're not interested in politics. Is that right?
[32178.46s -> 32181.46s]  No. And I would like it if you'd stop talking about it, fish.
[32181.46s -> 32184.46s]  Well, what about violence in video games?
[32184.46s -> 32187.46s]  That's turning into a bigger
[32187.46s -> 32190.46s]  and bigger political issue every time some poor
[32190.46s -> 32193.46s]  disturbed kid decides to take his aggressions
[32193.46s -> 32196.46s]  out on his schoolmates instead of video game characters.
[32196.46s -> 32199.46s]  There are politicians in your government
[32199.46s -> 32202.46s]  that want to decide what kinds of games
[32202.46s -> 32205.46s]  you can and can't play.
[32205.46s -> 32208.46s]  They want to censor your games.
[32208.46s -> 32211.83s]  I don't know whether that's a good or bad
[32211.83s -> 32214.83s]  thing for other games, but for me
[32214.83s -> 32217.83s]  I'll probably try to make me put on some underwear.
[32217.83s -> 32220.83s]  And you wouldn't want to see that.
[32220.83s -> 32223.83s]  This is getting really, really fucking deep and dark and fucked up, isn't it?
[32223.83s -> 32230.64s]  Talk to me.
[32230.64s -> 32233.64s]  You know, when your country needs to decide
[32233.64s -> 32236.64s]  to something like whether to raise or lower taxes,
[32236.64s -> 32239.64s]  let women make a choice about having children,
[32239.64s -> 32242.64s]  or if gay people deserve to be treated
[32242.64s -> 32245.64s]  the same way as everyone else,
[32245.64s -> 32248.64s]  it doesn't have to be so complicated.
[32248.64s -> 32251.64s]  It used to be so much simpler.
[32251.64s -> 32254.64s]  A king or maybe an emperor or a pharaoh
[32254.64s -> 32257.64s]  would say, do it this way.
[32257.64s -> 32260.64s]  And that would be that.
[32260.64s -> 32263.64s]  No elections, no debates, no lobbyists,
[32263.64s -> 32266.64s]  no congressional subcommittees, no endless legal battles.
[32266.64s -> 32269.64s]  One giant rat.
[32269.64s -> 32272.64s]  Ah, those were the days.
[32272.64s -> 32275.64s]  This system is so complicated.
[32275.64s -> 32278.64s]  Do you think it's done this way to give everyone a say in government?
[32278.64s -> 32281.64s]  That's the point.
[32281.64s -> 32285.25s]  Yes.
[32285.25s -> 32288.25s]  Stop this frog.
[32288.25s -> 32291.25s]  Your system of government is actually set up
[32291.25s -> 32295.51s]  for exactly the opposite purpose.
[32295.51s -> 32298.51s]  That's you. Don't get enough power to screw things up.
[32298.51s -> 32301.51s]  So, let's see.
[32302.51s -> 32305.51s]  Boil this frog. Yes.
[32311.51s -> 32314.51s]  I do. Yes.
[32332.51s -> 32335.51s]  Know why your founding fathers did that?
[32335.51s -> 32338.51s]  So, if the people tried to actually do something,
[32338.51s -> 32341.51s]  let's say by electing a president they wanted,
[32341.51s -> 32344.51s]  Congress and the Supreme Court
[32344.51s -> 32347.51s]  could still stop them from messing things up.
[32347.51s -> 32350.69s]  So, what you have is a system designed
[32350.69s -> 32353.69s]  to stop people like you from having a say in the government.
[32353.69s -> 32356.69s]  I'm not even streaming anymore.
[32356.69s -> 32359.69s]  This is just Frog has a fucking podcast
[32359.69s -> 32362.69s]  that you're listening to.
[32362.69s -> 32365.69s]  I'm not even here anymore.
[32365.69s -> 32368.69s]  The controversial fucking politics frog
[32368.69s -> 32371.69s]  on iTunes.
[32371.69s -> 32374.69s]  All right, we're good.
[32374.69s -> 32377.69s]  Talk to me.
[32377.69s -> 32380.69s]  We've got one more day.
[32380.69s -> 32383.69s]  And that's it. Talk to me.
[32383.69s -> 32386.69s]  Talk to me.
[32386.69s -> 32390.31s]  That is not this more.
[32390.31s -> 32393.31s]  This more.
[32393.31s -> 32399.35s]  Talk to me.
[32399.35s -> 32403.81s]  Talk to me.
[32404.81s -> 32408.30s]  That is not this more.
[32408.30s -> 32411.74s]  What do I do? I turn the lights on?
[32411.74s -> 32415.17s]  Don't. Talk to me.
[32415.17s -> 32418.17s]  Keep going. Keep ranting and raving
[32418.17s -> 32421.17s]  until you're like eight followers on your podcast.
[32436.17s -> 32439.17s]  God, this is getting worse.
[32439.17s -> 32442.17s]  I'm gonna mute this one, too.
[32460.67s -> 32463.67s]  I ain't gonna rule it out.
[32463.67s -> 32466.67s]  Because the Chalupa exists.
[32466.67s -> 32470.92s]  I ain't gonna rule it out. Maybe.
[32470.92s -> 32473.92s]  You're unsure about the matter, is that right?
[32473.92s -> 32477.10s]  Yes.
[32477.10s -> 32480.10s]  You know, some of the smartest humans have spent decades
[32480.10s -> 32483.10s]  thinking about this and have never come up with an answer.
[32483.10s -> 32486.10s]  Others seem to just know right when they are born.
[32486.10s -> 32489.10s]  It's possible. I don't know.
[32489.10s -> 32492.10s]  Thinking about it is more important than coming up with an answer.
[32492.10s -> 32495.10s]  I don't know if that's a concept people think.
[32495.10s -> 32500.58s]  I don't know, but talk to me.
[32511.09s -> 32514.09s]  Centrist agnostic streamer
[32514.09s -> 32517.09s]  terrified to give opinion on stream.
[32517.09s -> 32520.09s]  I just told you, the Chalupa exists.
[32529.09s -> 32532.09s]  No.
[32532.09s -> 32535.09s]  It's like me and my dog connect and have the same dreams.
[32535.09s -> 32539.98s]  No.
[32563.98s -> 32566.98s]  At least it seems that they'll be all the wiser
[32566.98s -> 32569.98s]  by simply having thought about it.
[32569.98s -> 32575.39s]  Keep going, man. You got an audience here.
[32575.39s -> 32578.39s]  Your rave podcast has 3,700 people almost listening to it.
[32578.39s -> 32581.39s]  Let's go. Talk to me.
[32581.39s -> 32585.32s]  Let's talk.
[32585.32s -> 32588.32s]  I'm not your trained monkey, all right?
[32588.32s -> 32591.32s]  Yeah, do you mean to like rub your back for a second?
[32591.32s -> 32596.22s]  Are you happy?
[32597.22s -> 32601.55s]  Let's talk.
[32601.55s -> 32608.44s]  Alright, you've given me plenty to ponder,
[32608.44s -> 32611.44s]  but here's what I really want to know.
[32611.44s -> 32614.44s]  What my questions have been leading up to.
[32614.44s -> 32617.44s]  Ready?
[32617.44s -> 32620.87s]  I want you to think about this and give me a serious answer.
[32620.87s -> 32627.36s]  Do you think you're a good person?
[32627.36s -> 32630.36s]  Yes.
[32630.36s -> 32634.16s]  So you think you're a good person?
[32634.16s -> 32637.40s]  Is that so?
[32637.40s -> 32640.40s]  Politicians often complain that your society would be more ethical
[32640.40s -> 32643.40s]  if more humans were religious,
[32643.40s -> 32646.40s]  and yet even though you don't belong to any organized religion,
[32646.40s -> 32649.40s]  you consider yourself a good person.
[32649.40s -> 32652.40s]  Perhaps politicians are not as smart as they think.
[32652.40s -> 32656.54s]  You're probably fucking r-correct.
[32656.54s -> 32661.42s]  Let's talk.
[32661.42s -> 32668.76s]  Give it to me. Tell me more.
[32668.76s -> 32671.76s]  Give it to me is your name? I thought your name was Greg.
[32671.76s -> 32674.76s]  After everything you've told me about yourself,
[32674.76s -> 32677.76s]  I think I already know how you feel on this subject,
[32677.76s -> 32680.76s]  but I still want to ask you.
[32680.76s -> 32683.76s]  Do you think religion makes the world a better place
[32683.76s -> 32687.45s]  or a worse place?
[32687.45s -> 32703.68s]  God damn it.
[32703.68s -> 32711.02s]  Ready to try this?
[32711.02s -> 32714.02s]  I already know how you feel on this subject,
[32714.02s -> 32717.02s]  but I still want to ask you.
[32717.02s -> 32728.64s]  Do you think that you could take or leave the whole faith thing?
[32728.64s -> 32731.64s]  Well, how about this then?
[32731.64s -> 32734.64s]  That's not what I said.
[32734.64s -> 32737.64s]  Let's say there were only one religion in the world.
[32737.64s -> 32740.64s]  Would the world be a better or worse place?
[32740.64s -> 32747.85s]  If there was only one religion in the world, would the-
[32747.85s -> 32750.85s]  So you think the world would reverse off if there were only one religion?
[32750.85s -> 32753.85s]  You know, yes.
[32753.85s -> 32756.85s]  I don't know. No. Can I change my answer?
[32756.85s -> 32759.85s]  The world would be a lot less interesting
[32759.85s -> 32762.85s]  if everyone were carbon copies of one another.
[32762.85s -> 32765.85s]  Well, as I'm sure you've guessed,
[32765.85s -> 32768.85s]  I find the whole institution of religion
[32768.85s -> 32771.85s]  quite confounding.
[32771.85s -> 32774.85s]  Most humans run around like they're masters of the world
[32774.85s -> 32777.85s]  while at the same time bowing down to a higher power
[32777.85s -> 32780.85s]  that's supposed to make life better.
[32780.85s -> 32783.85s]  On top of that, most people can't even agree
[32783.85s -> 32786.85s]  on who or what the higher power is,
[32786.85s -> 32789.85s]  so they argue and fight over it
[32789.85s -> 32792.85s]  and bring about a lot of misery and heartbreak
[32792.85s -> 32795.85s]  in the name of something that is supposed to bring people joy.
[32795.85s -> 32798.85s]  I just don't get it.
[32798.85s -> 32801.85s]  And quite frankly, just thinking about it
[32801.85s -> 32804.85s]  gives me a headache, so I'm going to go away
[32804.85s -> 32807.85s]  and try and figure it all out.
[32808.85s -> 32811.85s]  That's it.
[32811.85s -> 32816.82s]  Took us nine hours, but I think we did it.
[32816.82s -> 32824.54s]  Talk to me. This frog's going to end your career.
[32824.54s -> 32829.38s]  This stupid Dreamcast frog
[32829.38s -> 32832.38s]  is going to end your career on Twitch.
[32832.38s -> 32837.22s]  That's so fucking funny.
[32837.22s -> 32845.43s]  Why have I been live for so long?
[32845.43s -> 32848.43s]  Because I've got to get this done.
[32848.43s -> 32858.76s]  I'm just having fun. I'm just chilling.
[32858.76s -> 32864.24s]  We've got politics, we've got religion.
[32864.24s -> 32868.12s]  Let's see what happens.
[32868.12s -> 32874.69s]  Show it to me, Leonard. Let's see the end.
[32874.69s -> 32890.52s]  It's almost 4am now.
[32890.52s -> 32893.52s]  This is almost like the 30th time
[32893.52s -> 32897.21s]  I've turned this off.
[32897.21s -> 32903.26s]  The Pope just called you out on Twitter.
[32903.26s -> 32917.03s]  What am I going to do?
[32917.03s -> 32920.03s]  Show me the end.
[32921.03s -> 32925.02s]  One of them got sick.
[32925.02s -> 32928.46s]  They did a bunch of podcasts.
[32928.46s -> 32931.46s]  I just gave this frog a platform
[32931.46s -> 32935.85s]  to give all of his political stances while I watched.
[32935.85s -> 32949.78s]  Here we go.
[32949.78s -> 32953.21s]  You watched helplessly.
[32968.85s -> 32971.85s]  He's ascended into another being.
[32990.31s -> 32994.00s]  Still two.
[33008.83s -> 33012.39s]  I'm really looking forward to this.
[33012.39s -> 33019.41s]  I've been here three seconds and I'm bored out of my mind.
[33019.41s -> 33028.02s]  You got here three seconds ago.
[33028.02s -> 33031.78s]  I was loading the Dreamcast up.
[33031.78s -> 33036.30s]  You've seen a menu.
[33036.30s -> 33039.30s]  Give it another 30 seconds.
[33039.30s -> 33042.98s]  After 30 seconds, if you think this sucks,
[33042.98s -> 33045.98s]  I have respect for your opinion.
[33045.98s -> 33051.72s]  Give it another 30 seconds.
[33055.72s -> 33058.72s]  He said he evolved into a full frogman.
[33058.72s -> 33061.72s]  That was fantastic.
[33061.72s -> 33065.98s]  This is much better.
[33065.98s -> 33070.31s]  If you want to believe in that spirit,
[33070.31s -> 33073.31s]  I have completely respect for your opinion.
[33080.47s -> 33088.50s]  I can't even read that one.
[33088.50s -> 33091.50s]  It's just too...
[33098.50s -> 33101.50s]  I'm feeling a little peckish.
[33101.50s -> 33104.50s]  Could you feed me?
[33104.50s -> 33118.54s]  There's no difference.
[33118.54s -> 33121.54s]  Sprinkler's good.
[33121.54s -> 33124.54s]  Light is good.
[33124.54s -> 33128.16s]  Who gives a shit about spiders?
[33128.16s -> 33135.43s]  I've got plenty of food and bugs.
[33135.43s -> 33140.32s]  Speaking of bugs, let's grab these.
[33140.32s -> 33152.12s]  Drop them in.
[33152.12s -> 33155.68s]  I'll put it in the inventory.
[33155.68s -> 33161.91s]  Eat and let's end it.
[33161.91s -> 33168.54s]  Go eat.
[33168.54s -> 33175.30s]  What's the final topic going to be?
[33175.30s -> 33185.78s]  I'm surprised I ended up with two.
[33185.78s -> 33188.78s]  My compliments to the chef.
[33188.78s -> 33196.69s]  My stomach is growling.
[33196.69s -> 33200.44s]  Hey, you.
[33200.44s -> 33204.26s]  I never knew humans were so nocturnal.
[33204.26s -> 33211.51s]  Talk to me.
[33211.51s -> 33219.49s]  I'm all talked out for today.
[33219.49s -> 33224.58s]  Let's talk.
[33224.58s -> 33228.02s]  Where is it now?
[33228.02s -> 33231.02s]  I could really eat.
[33231.02s -> 33244.35s]  It's right behind you.
[33244.35s -> 33247.85s]  I'm hungry.
[33247.85s -> 33257.30s]  Yummy, baity goodness.
[33257.30s -> 33263.83s]  I'm full now.
[33263.83s -> 33274.61s]  Talk to me.
[33274.61s -> 33278.30s]  What the fuck is he doing?
[33278.30s -> 33285.87s]  He's like...
[33285.87s -> 33288.87s]  He just drained all of his life for us.
[33288.87s -> 33293.90s]  Who's your daddy?
[33293.90s -> 33303.40s]  Did either of them die?
[33303.40s -> 33319.95s]  I don't think they just had sex.
[33319.95s -> 33325.88s]  They're still alive.
[33325.88s -> 33330.14s]  The last two generations, one of them died.
[33330.14s -> 33334.52s]  Hello?
[33334.52s -> 33342.24s]  Hello.
[33342.24s -> 33345.86s]  Religion was the last topic, so what happens now?
[33345.86s -> 33359.22s]  How do we get to the end?
[33359.22s -> 33362.22s]  Whatever the last thing that comes out is?
[33362.22s -> 33366.54s]  Maybe it's whatever comes out here.
[33366.54s -> 33372.60s]  They just had sex.
[33372.60s -> 33375.60s]  They've eaten.
[33375.60s -> 33389.05s]  They don't want to talk to me.
[33389.05s -> 33396.75s]  Talk to me.
[33396.75s -> 33399.75s]  Let's talk.
[33399.75s -> 33407.34s]  Fuck off.
[33407.34s -> 33426.46s]  You just had sex, you gotta take a whole day off?
[33426.46s -> 33434.48s]  Just like me?
[33434.48s -> 33450.20s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[33450.20s -> 33456.56s]  Grind doesn't stop here.
[33456.56s -> 33475.27s]  I've been here for nine hours.
[33475.27s -> 33481.65s]  There are credits, that's when you can stop.
[33481.65s -> 33484.65s]  I'm going to see those credits.
[33516.78s -> 33526.47s]  Is there any way for them not to suffer from the cold?
[33526.47s -> 33529.47s]  I don't think so.
[33529.47s -> 33532.47s]  Well, that's not true.
[33532.47s -> 33535.47s]  Check on them instead of 24 hours.
[33535.47s -> 33538.65s]  Turn your Dreamcast on six to eight hours instead of 24.
[33538.65s -> 33541.65s]  I would assume that's probably what it is.
[33541.65s -> 33551.10s]  You can check on them every hour.
[33551.10s -> 33555.09s]  No, I ain't doing that.
[33563.21s -> 33567.34s]  Someone out there put on a sprinkler for me.
[33567.34s -> 33570.34s]  There's not enough moisture here.
[33570.34s -> 33573.34s]  Hey, it's a big hole here.
[33573.34s -> 33578.81s]  I'm going to get all the answers.
[33578.81s -> 33586.91s]  Every answer I've given, they're going to make a big essay about me.
[33586.91s -> 33590.09s]  I'm going to get Psychomantist at the end of the game.
[33590.09s -> 33593.09s]  It's going to say, ooh, yes, oh, I see.
[33593.09s -> 33596.09s]  I can't believe you don't work out.
[33596.09s -> 33599.09s]  And that you're
[33599.09s -> 33602.84s]  not fat.
[33602.84s -> 33605.84s]  And that you like pizza.
[33605.84s -> 33622.06s]  It's going to be something like that, I guarantee it.
[33622.06s -> 33625.06s]  I have an entire production of food here, even if the spider eats one of those.
[33625.06s -> 33628.06s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[33628.06s -> 33644.54s]  Not enough spray going on here.
[33644.54s -> 33650.98s]  I got plenty of food.
[33650.98s -> 33654.54s]  This is going to hatch in a minute here.
[33654.54s -> 33663.86s]  Yes, you definitely could.
[33663.86s -> 33673.06s]  We can both and see if we can get anything out of it.
[33673.06s -> 33678.86s]  This is actually one of the worst games I've ever seen.
[33678.86s -> 33681.86s]  It is a classic, though.
[33684.86s -> 33687.86s]  I looked up how to get to the credits. End the stream now.
[33687.86s -> 33696.52s]  Why are you saying that?
[33696.52s -> 33699.52s]  Yep, I'm stuffed.
[33699.52s -> 33702.52s]  You the guy from fucking Storage Wars?
[33702.52s -> 33711.97s]  How about we strap on the feed bag?
[33711.97s -> 33723.38s]  Talk to me.
[33723.38s -> 33726.38s]  Why are you phasing out?
[33726.38s -> 33729.38s]  I sound like Santa.
[33729.38s -> 33735.74s]  Yum, food.
[33735.74s -> 33739.80s]  Okay, they both fed.
[33739.80s -> 33742.80s]  Give me something. Let me end this.
[33742.80s -> 33748.14s]  Oh, excuse me. No more room.
[33748.14s -> 33753.28s]  Okay. Hi. Hello.
[33753.28s -> 33772.92s]  Hello. Hello. Hello.
[33772.92s -> 33777.10s]  Hey, Greg. Greg.
[33777.10s -> 33795.61s]  Wake up. Get up.
[33795.61s -> 33798.61s]  He's not even responding to my, like, hand twitches.
[33798.61s -> 33803.67s]  This is not good. Greg. Hello.
[33822.05s -> 33825.22s]  It's important.
[33825.22s -> 33828.53s]  Really, really important.
[33828.53s -> 33836.38s]  Can you let me out, please?
[33836.38s -> 33839.62s]  Please. If I am released, I give you my word
[33839.62s -> 33842.62s]  that I will keep all your secrets.
[33842.62s -> 33845.62s]  You see, there are some things I need to do.
[33845.62s -> 33848.79s]  What do you say?
[33848.79s -> 33853.10s]  Yes.
[33853.10s -> 33856.10s]  I know it sounds odd, but I must keep evolving.
[33856.10s -> 33859.10s]  I have to keep growing so I can find
[33859.10s -> 33862.10s]  my long-lost love again.
[33862.10s -> 33865.54s]  It's been a long, long time.
[33865.54s -> 33868.71s]  What? You see, my father was the king of Egypt
[33868.71s -> 33871.71s]  back in its third dynasty, and
[33871.71s -> 33874.71s]  my lover's father was a priest in the temple.
[33874.71s -> 33878.14s]  Oh, we were young and both swept away
[33878.14s -> 33881.14s]  by the passion. I'm sure you understand.
[33881.14s -> 33885.28s]  Oh, my dear sweet love.
[33885.28s -> 33888.28s]  She was the most beautiful creature imaginable,
[33888.28s -> 33891.28s]  but neither of our fathers would approve
[33891.28s -> 33894.28s]  our marriage because of our class differences.
[33894.28s -> 33897.28s]  When we insisted we be allowed to marry,
[33897.28s -> 33900.28s]  her father consulted the god Thoth
[33900.28s -> 33903.28s]  and asked him to help.
[33903.28s -> 33906.28s]  Thoth granted her father's request for help
[33906.28s -> 33909.28s]  and changed our physical forms.
[33909.28s -> 33913.03s]  And we've been apart ever since.
[33913.03s -> 33916.03s]  And I have to continue evolving
[33916.03s -> 33919.03s]  so that I can be reunited with her
[33919.03s -> 33922.03s]  in another few thousand years.
[33922.03s -> 33925.03s]  So you'll help me get out, right?
[33925.03s -> 33928.03s]  Tell it to Satan, where you belong!
[33928.03s -> 33932.62s]  Yes.
[33932.62s -> 33936.05s]  I already have a plan how to get out.
[33936.05s -> 33939.05s]  See that ring over the tank?
[33939.05s -> 33942.05s]  I'm going to jump for it.
[33942.05s -> 33945.05s]  What about the other one?
[33945.05s -> 33948.05s]  What about the other one?
[33948.05s -> 33953.78s]  The other one doesn't have a backstory
[33953.78s -> 33958.56s]  about how he's the king of Egypt.
[33958.56s -> 33964.17s]  What about this one? This one's just a frog guy?
[33964.17s -> 33969.50s]  Okay, jump, right?
[33969.50s -> 33985.85s]  Oh, missed.
[33985.85s -> 33990.93s]  Try again.
[33990.93s -> 33995.19s]  Greetings, my vampiric friend.
[33995.19s -> 34005.39s]  Hello? Talk to me.
[34005.39s -> 34012.66s]  So, I'd like to ask you.
[34012.66s -> 34015.66s]  How are things going with your girlfriend?
[34015.66s -> 34018.66s]  Are you guys still an item?
[34018.66s -> 34022.16s]  Yes. What about this Egypt guy?
[34022.16s -> 34025.40s]  That's splendid. You know, it's interesting to me
[34025.40s -> 34028.40s]  how preoccupied you humans seem with love and relationships.
[34028.40s -> 34031.40s]  You write songs about it,
[34031.40s -> 34034.40s]  compose poems,
[34034.40s -> 34037.40s]  search for soulmates,
[34037.40s -> 34040.40s]  and are constantly hoping for happily ever after.
[34040.40s -> 34043.40s]  I'm curious as to how you experience love.
[34043.40s -> 34046.40s]  For example, do you think your girlfriend is
[34046.40s -> 34051.75s]  the one?
[34051.75s -> 34059.66s]  What about Egypt?
[34059.66s -> 34073.85s]  I'm starting to lose...
[34073.85s -> 34081.36s]  Do you think your girlfriend is the one?
[34081.36s -> 34085.75s]  So you're not the one?
[34085.75s -> 34088.75s]  Oh, I don't have to hide for this one.
[34088.75s -> 34091.75s]  I don't know.
[34094.75s -> 34097.75s]  I don't know, I don't know.
[34097.75s -> 34100.75s]  I don't know.
[34100.75s -> 34103.75s]  We've talked about it before.
[34103.75s -> 34106.75s]  This fucking frog is fucking up my strength.
[34106.75s -> 34109.75s]  He's making me fucking answer uncomfortable questions?
[34109.75s -> 34112.75s]  He's making me talk about things?
[34112.75s -> 34115.75s]  Why do you think that is?
[34115.75s -> 34118.75s]  Will you fucking eat him already?
[34118.75s -> 34122.42s]  I don't know.
[34122.42s -> 34125.42s]  You don't know what the number one cause of divorce is?
[34125.42s -> 34128.42s]  I don't know. What is it?
[34128.42s -> 34131.42s]  I'm not sure, but I think it's ignorance.
[34131.42s -> 34134.42s]  Why would I know that answer though?
[34134.42s -> 34137.42s]  Jump to the ring. Stop exposing me.
[34137.42s -> 34140.42s]  Jump to ring. Stop.
[34140.42s -> 34143.92s]  Well, Fuzzy, you've experienced hesitation
[34143.92s -> 34146.92s]  when confronted with the idea of being
[34146.92s -> 34149.92s]  permanently bound to your partner.
[34149.92s -> 34152.92s]  That makes me think. Is it you?
[34152.92s -> 34155.92s]  Is it the person you're with, or is it something
[34155.92s -> 34158.92s]  you've got to ease yourself into?
[34158.92s -> 34161.92s]  That's why I want to ask you this.
[34161.92s -> 34164.92s]  Do you believe that there's a perfect person
[34164.92s -> 34168.10s]  out there for you?
[34168.10s -> 34171.10s]  So you say you don't believe in such nonsense.
[34171.10s -> 34174.10s]  Am I right?
[34174.10s -> 34177.10s]  It doesn't. Now it does.
[34177.10s -> 34180.34s]  Take a stand.
[34180.34s -> 34186.70s]  Does true love exist?
[34186.70s -> 34189.70s]  So you say you don't believe in such nonsense.
[34189.70s -> 34194.78s]  Am I right?
[34194.78s -> 34197.78s]  You know, most Virgos have shy
[34197.78s -> 34200.78s]  and modest exteriors that hide wild
[34200.78s -> 34203.78s]  foolish and passionate hearts.
[34203.78s -> 34206.78s]  I guess you must be the exception to that rule.
[34206.78s -> 34212.06s]  Boy, do I have to dump.
[34212.06s -> 34231.11s]  Jump to the ring.
[34231.11s -> 34245.02s]  What can I do for you?
[34245.02s -> 34251.13s]  Escape. Escape.
[34251.13s -> 34254.13s]  You know, I've seen you naked. Now that's
[34254.13s -> 34258.71s]  scary.
[34258.71s -> 34261.71s]  How do I make them jump and grab it?
[34261.71s -> 34273.64s]  Something in particular? Talk to me.
[34273.64s -> 34276.64s]  This better be good. I have to hold up.
[34276.64s -> 34281.16s]  Grab the rock in the back and wiggle it.
[34281.16s -> 34284.78s]  I have to increase the temperature to a hundred.
[34284.78s -> 34291.53s]  Oh, fuck off with that.
[34291.53s -> 34295.22s]  Why don't you pick on somebody?
[34295.22s -> 34300.06s]  Oh, fuck. That just scared the shit out of me.
[34300.06s -> 34304.32s]  Help me move it then. Can I touch the ring?
[34304.32s -> 34307.56s]  That's what I was thinking. I can't grab the ring.
[34307.56s -> 34311.63s]  I can't focus on it. I can't really touch it.
[34311.63s -> 34315.83s]  I can't pull it down. Jump.
[34315.83s -> 34321.94s]  Talk to you soon.
[34321.94s -> 34326.95s]  Move the rock. Move rock. Move the rock.
[34326.95s -> 34329.95s]  You know, I'm really glad that you found someone
[34329.95s -> 34332.95s]  you can spend your romantic time with.
[34332.95s -> 34335.95s]  I think that's terribly cute.
[34335.95s -> 34338.95s]  No, really. I think it's hard for people
[34338.95s -> 34341.95s]  to connect in such a gigantic, scary world.
[34341.95s -> 34345.32s]  I mean, sure, it seems simple to an outsider like me,
[34345.32s -> 34348.32s]  considering just how many of you there are,
[34348.32s -> 34351.32s]  but if it were so simple, why would there be
[34351.32s -> 34354.32s]  so many dating services to choose from?
[34354.32s -> 34357.32s]  That's why I'm curious.
[34357.32s -> 34360.32s]  Where did you meet your girlfriend?
[34360.32s -> 34363.32s]  At a Christmas party.
[34363.32s -> 34366.32s]  I see. I think maybe this whole dating game
[34366.32s -> 34369.32s]  is more kismet than skill.
[34369.32s -> 34372.32s]  The thing is, it's all circumstance, isn't it?
[34372.32s -> 34375.32s]  I mean, if you hadn't been in the right place
[34375.32s -> 34378.32s]  at the right time, then things could have turned out
[34378.32s -> 34381.32s]  a whole lot differently, couldn't they?
[34381.32s -> 34384.32s]  If you'd been somewhere else, grown up in another country,
[34384.32s -> 34387.32s]  for example, and never come to be where you are,
[34387.32s -> 34390.32s]  your entire set of friends and where you spend
[34390.32s -> 34393.32s]  your free time would be completely different.
[34393.32s -> 34396.32s]  Your personality would no doubt be very different as well.
[34396.32s -> 34399.32s]  It's funny how certain events mold us all
[34399.32s -> 34402.32s]  and how easy it would be to be an entirely
[34402.32s -> 34405.32s]  different personality than you are.
[34405.32s -> 34408.32s]  Yeah, certain events like jumping and grabbing a ring,
[34408.32s -> 34411.32s]  which one of you dickheads needs to do right now.
[34411.32s -> 34415.20s]  Escape.
[34415.20s -> 34420.15s]  Like the spice.
[34420.15s -> 34424.74s]  Jump. Cheerio.
[34424.74s -> 34427.74s]  You know what I find interesting?
[34427.74s -> 34430.74s]  You were probably born into a family,
[34430.74s -> 34433.74s]  and for the next two decades or so had to interact
[34433.74s -> 34436.74s]  with them on a daily basis.
[34436.74s -> 34439.74s]  I mean, with any group of people, there are bound
[34439.74s -> 34442.74s]  to be love and hate issues, and a whole range
[34442.74s -> 34445.74s]  of emotions in between. And as you matured,
[34445.74s -> 34448.74s]  conflicts, I'm sure, arose as your interests
[34448.74s -> 34451.74s]  became more individualized and pronounced,
[34451.74s -> 34454.74s]  often differing from your family's.
[34454.74s -> 34457.74s]  Of course, maybe that just brought you closer,
[34457.74s -> 34460.74s]  which leads me to wonder,
[34460.74s -> 34464.04s]  how well do you get along with your family?
[34464.04s -> 34467.73s]  Well.
[34467.73s -> 34470.73s]  So everything's pretty good? Yep.
[34470.73s -> 34473.73s]  Wait, you said you get along with your family.
[34473.73s -> 34476.73s]  Now you say you don't.
[34476.73s -> 34479.73s]  Do you get along well with your family or not? Yes.
[34479.73s -> 34482.73s]  So everything's pretty good? Yes.
[34482.73s -> 34486.29s]  You're all swimming in the same ocean, then.
[34486.29s -> 34489.29s]  That must make those family get-togethers
[34489.29s -> 34492.29s]  a lot easier to get through.
[34492.29s -> 34495.29s]  Now, how about friends?
[34495.29s -> 34499.42s]  Do you get along better with your friends or your family?
[34499.42s -> 34503.67s]  Both.
[34503.67s -> 34506.67s]  Well, that makes sense, since those are the people
[34506.67s -> 34509.67s]  you've chosen, whereas you didn't get to choose your family.
[34509.67s -> 34512.67s]  The trick is to get along with everybody.
[34512.67s -> 34515.67s]  People are much happier when they can do that.
[34515.67s -> 34524.27s]  You probably are. Jump.
[34524.27s -> 34528.97s]  Later, Fuzzy. Ring.
[34528.97s -> 34531.97s]  You seem to love your family, and they must love you.
[34531.97s -> 34534.97s]  That's nice.
[34534.97s -> 34537.97s]  No, really. With all this love floating around,
[34537.97s -> 34540.97s]  do you think you were raised well?
[34540.97s -> 34544.40s]  Yeah. Well, at least you get along with them.
[34544.40s -> 34547.40s]  Maybe they did a good job and you didn't even know it.
[34547.40s -> 34550.40s]  Do you think if they weren't your parents,
[34550.40s -> 34553.40s]  you could still be friends with them?
[34553.40s -> 34556.40s]  You know, pals.
[34556.40s -> 34559.40s]  Friends with my mom? If it's not my mom?
[34559.40s -> 34562.40s]  Yes.
[34562.40s -> 34565.40s]  Maybe they are better friends than they were parents.
[34565.40s -> 34568.40s]  This one. So this one.
[34568.40s -> 34571.40s]  The other one was a ranting and raving political
[34571.40s -> 34574.40s]  podcast runner, but this one's just like,
[34574.40s -> 34577.40s]  if you weren't, she weren't your mom.
[34577.40s -> 34590.59s]  Jump. Jump.
[34590.59s -> 34596.12s]  Talk to me.
[34596.12s -> 34599.12s]  So it's over. I lose.
[34599.12s -> 34616.98s]  Jump.
[34616.98s -> 34619.98s]  See? Look.
[34619.98s -> 34622.98s]  Don't go to the next day.
[34622.98s -> 34625.98s]  Reload. Restart. Just reload the save.
[34625.98s -> 34630.25s]  And then wiggle the rock before
[34630.25s -> 34635.60s]  Advanced time or reset?
[34635.60s -> 34643.58s]  Which one? You have to attempt it three times.
[34643.58s -> 34649.55s]  Going for it? Okay, advance a day.
[34649.55s -> 34653.11s]  Advance a day. You got it.
[34653.11s -> 34678.10s]  Fuck the food. Who cares? They can starve.
[34678.10s -> 34681.10s]  Don't advance. Don't advance. Are we going to get like a fucking fight
[34681.10s -> 34684.10s]  in chat here about how to finish this ten hour game?
[34684.10s -> 34706.79s]  What's wrong? I'll get it. I'll get it myself.
[34706.79s -> 34723.20s]  Ring. Find on this page.
[34723.20s -> 34731.75s]  Ring. Jump.
[34731.75s -> 34738.50s]  He's going to jump? What the fuck is it, man?
[34738.50s -> 34747.82s]  Because the only way he can continue to evolve is by getting outside.
[34747.82s -> 34750.82s]  Seema says he thinks that pesky ring hanging from the upper left of the tank
[34750.82s -> 34754.06s]  should be the key to getting that.
[34754.06s -> 34757.06s]  He will try to jump to it from the big rock, asking that you say
[34757.06s -> 34760.06s]  jump for encouragement. On his third try,
[34760.06s -> 34763.06s]  he will reach it and the back panel of the tank will
[34763.06s -> 34767.32s]  slide down. Okay.
[34767.32s -> 34772.16s]  We advance. That's ten community subs from Peek a Banana.
[34772.16s -> 34775.72s]  Thank you, Peek a Banana, for the ten subs.
[34775.72s -> 34783.42s]  That's a lot of subs. Thank you. Let's go.
[34783.42s -> 34789.86s]  He spoiled the ending. Oh, he didn't just say he liked the...
[34789.86s -> 34793.42s]  He jumps out of the tank. That's all I read.
[34793.42s -> 34796.42s]  Two more days. What day was it? Five?
[34796.42s -> 34799.92s]  What if I... No, five. Right?
[34799.92s -> 34810.46s]  But Peek a Banana, that's a fucking lot of subs. Thank you.
[34810.46s -> 34814.46s]  Who cares about Seeman spoilers?
[34814.46s -> 34820.33s]  We're on four. We're now on five. Let's go. Fuck it.
[34820.33s -> 34824.08s]  Two more jumps. See you at ten hours.
[34824.08s -> 34834.09s]  See you at ten hours.
[34834.09s -> 34839.06s]  I need to see the end, because I'd have to be the first person
[34839.06s -> 34842.06s]  to play it and beat it on stream on regular,
[34842.06s -> 34846.13s]  regular hardware. You know what I mean?
[34846.13s -> 34849.13s]  You might get somebody that streams this game like,
[34849.13s -> 34852.13s]  Seeman, I heard of that game. Didn't that fucking top
[34852.13s -> 34855.13s]  one thousand streamer, German985, play that?
[34855.13s -> 34858.13s]  I heard about that through his fucking fan-tastic stream.
[34863.13s -> 34866.43s]  What am I going to do on a fucking emulator?
[34870.43s -> 34873.74s]  He did it on a regular hardware.
[34873.74s -> 34876.74s]  Well, do you notice Frogman trying to reach the ring
[34876.74s -> 34879.74s]  hanging from the ceiling?
[34879.74s -> 34882.74s]  Perhaps this holds the key to the next step
[34882.74s -> 34888.98s]  in Seeman's development.
[34888.98s -> 34892.22s]  At the moment, the habitat contains
[34892.22s -> 34895.40s]  two Frogmen.
[34895.40s -> 34898.40s]  They are suffering from the cold.
[34898.40s -> 34901.40s]  Please use the heater to raise the temperature
[34901.40s -> 34906.43s]  to a more comfortable level.
[34906.43s -> 34910.12s]  We are nearing the mating season
[34910.12s -> 34913.12s]  for the Frogmen.
[34913.12s -> 34916.12s]  This is something few humans have been...
[34916.12s -> 34919.12s]  Just pick them up and put them out of the cage.
[34919.12s -> 34926.33s]  So let us head over to the tank.
[34926.33s -> 34929.95s]  Let's see those credits.
[34929.95s -> 34933.19s]  Jump out. Say goodnight. Feed them.
[34933.19s -> 34937.20s]  Make sure they're watered. End. Next day.
[34937.20s -> 34946.20s]  Jump. Game over. I win.
[34947.20s -> 34955.56s]  If I get one more conversation
[34955.56s -> 34958.56s]  about if I'm going to marry my girlfriend or not,
[34958.56s -> 34961.56s]  or what political spectrum do I lean on,
[34961.56s -> 34964.56s]  I'm going to shot put one of these frogs.
[34964.56s -> 34967.56s]  Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?
[34967.56s -> 34970.56s]  There's not enough moisture here.
[34970.56s -> 34973.56s]  Finally, some service around here.
[34973.56s -> 34976.56s]  It's cold, isn't it?
[34976.56s -> 34984.28s]  Is your girlfriend in the room?
[34984.28s -> 34987.28s]  No, she's not in the room. Anybody else in the room?
[34987.28s -> 34990.28s]  Have you ever cheated on your girlfriend?
[34990.28s -> 34996.78s]  Ah, wet is wonderful.
[34996.78s -> 34999.78s]  Hey, can you give me something to eat?
[34999.78s -> 35008.08s]  Raise the temperature, would you?
[35008.08s -> 35011.77s]  He's getting defensive about this.
[35011.77s -> 35017.76s]  It's cold in here.
[35017.76s -> 35020.76s]  You would immediately and confidently say no.
[35020.76s -> 35024.96s]  That was Frogmen. Fuck off.
[35024.96s -> 35033.13s]  Hey, I got some food for you. Just kidding.
[35033.13s -> 35040.14s]  Our seaman could die of hunger in this place.
[35040.14s -> 35043.14s]  I'm kind of hungry.
[35043.14s -> 35050.99s]  It's like manna from heaven.
[35050.99s -> 35058.52s]  Say, you know what would be good right about now?
[35058.52s -> 35070.27s]  Some food. Eat it then.
[35070.27s -> 35076.58s]  Enough talking about it. I got BTTV.
[35076.58s -> 35081.68s]  Watch. I don't know how to do it.
[35081.68s -> 35084.68s]  That was damned yummy. I've no idea.
[35084.68s -> 35089.39s]  I got one more to feed.
[35089.39s -> 35092.82s]  I do have enough for one more day here.
[35092.82s -> 35097.66s]  More than that.
[35097.66s -> 35107.10s]  Speaking of being fed...
[35107.10s -> 35110.10s]  I have more than enough food for one more day.
[35110.10s -> 35116.84s]  Come here.
[35116.84s -> 35121.73s]  I got plenty of fucking food. Let's go.
[35121.73s -> 35129.83s]  Go jump. Eat that food. Try to jump out.
[35129.83s -> 35132.83s]  I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[35132.83s -> 35146.38s]  I need some good light so I can see.
[35146.38s -> 35149.38s]  Very good. You know how to turn the light on.
[35149.38s -> 35152.38s]  End my suffering. I'm trying to get this done fast.
[35152.38s -> 35157.84s]  Okay. Jump.
[35157.84s -> 35162.79s]  Jump.
[35162.79s -> 35165.79s]  Go for it. Get out.
[35165.79s -> 35168.79s]  You're lucky it's Friday or I'd be really angry.
[35168.79s -> 35171.79s]  Hey, hello.
[35171.79s -> 35174.79s]  You know today's the anniversary of the premiere of the
[35174.79s -> 35177.79s]  Vienna. Is he all right? I'm sure you know the year.
[35177.79s -> 35180.79s]  No, the other way on the rock. Does that count as an attempt?
[35180.79s -> 35183.79s]  Is that two?
[35183.79s -> 35189.02s]  I could go on and on.
[35189.02s -> 35192.02s]  All right. Remember what I told you before about
[35192.02s -> 35195.02s]  jumping to freedom to find my lost love?
[35195.02s -> 35198.19s]  Well, I've gotten up the nerve and I think I'm ready
[35198.19s -> 35201.19s]  to try it again.
[35201.19s -> 35204.19s]  So when I say now, say the word
[35204.19s -> 35207.75s]  Jump. Okay.
[35207.75s -> 35211.76s]  Here I go.
[35211.76s -> 35219.29s]  KXE gave 10 community subs. Thank you KXE.
[35219.29s -> 35223.36s]  This has been a lot of community subs tonight. Thank you guys.
[35223.36s -> 35228.58s]  Here it goes.
[35228.58s -> 35234.96s]  Jump. See you tomorrow.
[35234.96s -> 35248.63s]  Rhythmically tapping the glass
[35248.63s -> 35251.63s]  twice a second to keep it going causes the song to start playing.
[35251.63s -> 35258.14s]  What? What do you mean rhythmically?
[35258.14s -> 35265.97s]  What do you mean tapping the glass?
[35265.97s -> 35271.75s]  That's not right.
[35271.75s -> 35275.68s]  Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Bye.
[35275.68s -> 35279.11s]  Be seeing you.
[35279.11s -> 35292.18s]  Twice a second like that.
[35292.18s -> 35297.18s]  Two, one, two, one, two, two,
[35297.18s -> 35300.18s]  one, two, one, two,
[35300.18s -> 35303.18s]  one, two, one, two,
[35303.18s -> 35315.30s]  one, like that.
[35315.30s -> 35323.45s]  Twice a second. Once per second.
[35323.45s -> 35330.98s]  This is two right here. Now I know it's after.
[35330.98s -> 35333.98s]  I'm just trying to get the rhythm down.
[35333.98s -> 35340.03s]  Heartbeat with the tapping.
[35340.03s -> 35367.02s]  That's probably why it doesn't look right because the cameras are off.
[35367.02s -> 35370.64s]  The camera's not synced up perfectly.
[35379.82s -> 35382.82s]  So it's...
[35382.82s -> 35402.06s]  Right? You should grow a soul patch.
[35402.06s -> 35405.62s]  All right, sure. I'm just going to grow this out like long down here.
[35405.62s -> 35408.62s]  It's going to be like an extra tongue.
[35408.62s -> 35411.62s]  Like a long tongue coming from my mouth.
[35411.62s -> 35414.86s]  There it is. Last day. Four, six.
[35414.86s -> 35431.92s]  Go for it. Here we go.
[35431.92s -> 35438.28s]  He's going to make it.
[35438.28s -> 35441.28s]  And I can solidify my house in video game history.
[35441.28s -> 35454.18s]  It's been ten hours. Give me a break.
[35454.18s -> 35462.08s]  Oh, you made it.
[35462.08s -> 35467.67s]  This is the last day of Seaman.
[35467.67s -> 35471.55s]  Good morning.
[35471.55s -> 35475.24s]  Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gosset.
[35475.24s -> 35478.24s]  As you see, it's brilliant.
[35478.24s -> 35482.89s]  You're doing a good job.
[35482.89s -> 35485.89s]  At the moment, the habitat contains
[35485.89s -> 35490.60s]  two frogmen.
[35490.60s -> 35493.60s]  They are suffering from the cold.
[35493.60s -> 35496.60s]  Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.
[35496.60s -> 35499.84s]  So let us head over to the tank.
[35499.84s -> 35502.84s]  I'm losing my really great $400,000 a year
[35502.84s -> 35505.84s]  scientist job for letting out the experiments.
[35505.84s -> 35508.84s]  Do I cause World War...
[35508.84s -> 35525.25s]  World War IV because of this?
[35525.25s -> 35528.55s]  World War IV, yeah.
[35528.55s -> 35531.55s]  Because they're just frogs right now.
[35531.55s -> 35534.55s]  It's going to take them probably 40 or 50 years to...
[35534.55s -> 35537.79s]  Hundreds of years, probably.
[35537.79s -> 35540.79s]  Hundreds of fucking years.
[35540.79s -> 35543.79s]  So they're going to go into the fucking forest somewhere
[35543.79s -> 35546.79s]  and start evolving as aliens.
[35546.79s -> 35549.79s]  There's going to be another World War III before 100 years is over.
[35549.79s -> 35552.79s]  Once they're walking on two legs,
[35552.79s -> 35555.79s]  we'll be ready for World War III.
[35555.79s -> 35558.79s]  This heater sucks.
[35558.79s -> 35561.79s]  How am I still alive?
[35561.79s -> 35582.31s]  Oh, how are you still alive?
[35582.31s -> 35593.79s]  I was going to say, I'm not that old.
[35593.79s -> 35596.79s]  All right, final meal.
[35596.79s -> 35601.68s]  So here you go.
[35601.68s -> 35605.75s]  Good thing I had a good stockpile of food.
[35605.75s -> 35608.75s]  Give it a eat.
[35608.75s -> 35617.75s]  Who's going to get it?
[35617.75s -> 35620.75s]  Thanks.
[35620.75s -> 35634.09s]  Okay, bring in the other one.
[35634.09s -> 35647.94s]  Both of you eat. Check on the spiders.
[35647.94s -> 35653.34s]  I can't help this one.
[35653.34s -> 35662.56s]  It's fine.
[35662.56s -> 35680.12s]  Still an Anor Londo.
[35680.12s -> 35687.26s]  Will you eat that, please?
[35687.26s -> 35690.26s]  Hey, how about adding a little humidity?
[35690.26s -> 35693.87s]  It's good for my skin.
[35693.87s -> 35699.46s]  Right behind you. Turn around, Eden.
[35699.46s -> 35702.46s]  Talk to me. Time to go.
[35702.46s -> 35705.46s]  Escape. Right at the rock. Jump.
[35705.46s -> 35708.46s]  Time for you to jump for that ring.
[35708.46s -> 35716.42s]  And then we're going to go for it.
[35716.42s -> 35721.07s]  Come on, end this.
[35721.07s -> 35727.29s]  Hello.
[35727.29s -> 35732.58s]  Jump.
[35738.58s -> 35741.75s]  I'm a sea man.
[35741.75s -> 35744.75s]  So many variables.
[35744.75s -> 35747.75s]  So much can happen between different people
[35747.75s -> 35750.75s]  that life seems like one big jackpot.
[35750.75s -> 35753.75s]  I can tell you one thing, though.
[35753.75s -> 35756.75s]  It's perhaps the only universal truth
[35756.75s -> 35759.75s]  for all relationships, and that is,
[35759.75s -> 35762.75s]  all of your relationships will one day end.
[35762.75s -> 35765.75s]  Even with your closest companions,
[35765.75s -> 35768.75s]  be it by your own understanding,
[35768.75s -> 35771.75s]  or be it by your own mortality.
[35771.75s -> 35774.75s]  At some given point,
[35774.75s -> 35777.75s]  you will never speak to each other again.
[35777.75s -> 35780.75s]  But don't let that frighten you.
[35780.75s -> 35783.75s]  Your precious time on this planet
[35783.75s -> 35786.75s]  and the relationships you forge
[35786.75s -> 35789.75s]  are what makes life worth living.
[35789.75s -> 35792.75s]  Instead, appreciate what you have
[35792.75s -> 35795.75s]  and what you think you have to be with.
[35795.75s -> 35798.75s]  That will certainly make you a happier human being.
[35798.75s -> 35802.89s]  You can rest assured.
[35802.89s -> 35805.89s]  Goodbye. Go be free.
[35805.89s -> 35811.67s]  Go for it. Rock.
[35811.67s -> 35816.58s]  Go jump on the rock.
[35816.58s -> 35828.10s]  Rock. What? Rock.
[35828.10s -> 35836.13s]  Jump. Adieu.
[35836.13s -> 35845.83s]  Just jump on the rock.
[35846.83s -> 35849.83s]  Say, you know what would be good right about now?
[35849.83s -> 35852.83s]  Food.
[35852.83s -> 35855.83s]  Say, you know what would be good right about now?
[35855.83s -> 35858.83s]  Oh, good. Food.
[35858.83s -> 35867.50s]  Oh, good. Food.
[35867.50s -> 35872.85s]  Stop.
[35872.85s -> 35875.85s]  I'm not hungry anymore.
[35875.85s -> 35878.85s]  I'm not hungry anymore.
[35878.85s -> 35881.85s]  I'm not hungry anymore.
[35881.85s -> 35891.10s]  I'm not hungry anymore.
[35891.10s -> 35896.76s]  Turn around. Turn around.
[35896.76s -> 35904.03s]  Turn around and look at rock.
[35904.03s -> 35920.70s]  What do you need?
[35920.70s -> 35923.70s]  Ring.
[35923.70s -> 35928.01s]  I know you're not talking about me.
[35928.01s -> 35931.01s]  Check, um...
[35931.01s -> 35934.01s]  Anyway, I hope this hasn't been too embarrassing for you.
[35934.01s -> 35939.02s]  We'll talk again soon.
[35939.02s -> 35942.65s]  Goodbye.
[35942.65s -> 35950.43s]  Jump off rock.
[35950.43s -> 35971.90s]  Rock?
[35971.90s -> 35976.53s]  Let's talk. Let's talk.
[35976.53s -> 35986.17s]  Talk to me.
[35986.17s -> 35990.37s]  Let's talk.
[35990.37s -> 35994.74s]  He's stuck. Talk to me.
[35994.74s -> 35997.74s]  Quiet.
[35997.74s -> 36000.74s]  You're very, very, very...
[36000.74s -> 36003.74s]  Fucking Burger King flame broiled in about 10 seconds.
[36003.74s -> 36006.74s]  Burger King flame broiled in about 10 seconds.
[36006.74s -> 36014.66s]  Let's talk.
[36014.66s -> 36017.66s]  Hey, there are laws against that sort of thing.
[36017.66s -> 36042.26s]  Jump. Escape.
[36042.26s -> 36045.26s]  I did let's talk on both of them.
[36045.26s -> 36048.26s]  Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow.
[36048.26s -> 36051.56s]  No, just go for it.
[36051.56s -> 36066.50s]  We're going to have to do another day.
[36066.50s -> 36069.50s]  No, that's not... He doesn't understand.
[36069.50s -> 36077.84s]  Jump.
[36077.84s -> 36081.34s]  They think I'm saying bye.
[36081.34s -> 36108.00s]  I'm trying to finish this.
[36108.00s -> 36111.82s]  Do you guys think I'm trying to drag this shit out?
[36111.82s -> 36140.05s]  I'm trying to end it.
[36140.05s -> 36143.67s]  I'm going to be hearing this in my sleep, yeah?
[36143.67s -> 36147.10s]  Fuck, it's so late. It is so late.
[36147.10s -> 36150.10s]  It's almost 2 a.m. PST.
[36150.10s -> 36153.10s]  2 a.m. Eastern.
[36153.10s -> 36158.14s]  Oh man, I cannot believe...
[36158.14s -> 36161.44s]  I cannot believe there are still 3,700 people here.
[36161.44s -> 36165.13s]  I hope you're enjoying it. I hope you're having fun. Really.
[36165.13s -> 36168.13s]  You look half dead.
[36168.13s -> 36172.58s]  One of them is going to jump.
[36172.58s -> 36175.82s]  He doesn't give a shit.
[36175.82s -> 36180.54s]  He gave the fuck up too.
[36180.54s -> 36183.54s]  He's so done with saying all this stuff now.
[36183.54s -> 36186.54s]  Let's check on the tank.
[36186.54s -> 36189.54s]  Let's see exactly what's in there.
[36189.54s -> 36196.55s]  Give us a shit.
[36196.55s -> 36202.80s]  Let's go.
[36202.80s -> 36220.57s]  Let's go.
[36220.57s -> 36223.57s]  Let's see exactly what's in there.
[36223.57s -> 36226.57s]  Give us a shit. Just end it, man. Resident sleeper.
[36226.57s -> 36236.90s]  This would be very comfortable in the desert,
[36236.90s -> 36243.08s]  just like my Harlem days.
[36243.08s -> 36246.08s]  Hey, it's a good cold one.
[36246.08s -> 36249.58s]  I live in a food court, come what may.
[36249.58s -> 36258.00s]  What is wrong with you?
[36258.00s -> 36269.29s]  That's so fucking funny.
[36269.29s -> 36272.29s]  I was like a month in... No, just barely a month, right?
[36272.29s -> 36281.35s]  It's a little chilly, don't you think?
[36281.35s -> 36288.05s]  The Tamagotchi had more content?
[36288.05s -> 36291.05s]  I don't know if I believe that. It was made out of, like, sticks.
[36291.05s -> 36294.05s]  Hey, I'm getting a little hungry. How about some...
[36294.05s -> 36297.42s]  Uh-oh. Only one of you get to eat.
[36297.42s -> 36304.30s]  And you better jump.
[36304.30s -> 36310.15s]  I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.
[36310.15s -> 36317.87s]  Oh, fat boy.
[36317.87s -> 36328.20s]  Hey, listen up.
[36328.20s -> 36340.11s]  Hello? Talk to me.
[36340.11s -> 36343.11s]  Is it breakfast time already?
[36343.11s -> 36346.11s]  What is it with humans and this daylight savings?
[36346.11s -> 36349.11s]  Underwater, it's either day or it's night,
[36349.11s -> 36352.11s]  and you don't see us with a rising crime rate.
[36352.11s -> 36356.57s]  Take the hint.
[36356.57s -> 36368.30s]  How about a little nourishment here?
[36368.30s -> 36375.19s]  Talk to me. Thanks, I'm not interested.
[36375.19s -> 36397.18s]  Is this poisonous?
[36397.18s -> 36400.94s]  I'm fine. I'm good. I'm just tired.
[36400.94s -> 36411.54s]  What's wrong with you? What are you doing?
[36411.54s -> 36420.90s]  Alright, you both have eaten.
[36420.90s -> 36425.94s]  Eat it, and then just go for the jump.
[36425.94s -> 36428.94s]  You good? I'm gonna have it at that.
[36428.94s -> 36431.94s]  Perfect temperature, it's 24,
[36431.94s -> 36434.94s]  100 sprinkles, ambient mood lighting.
[36434.94s -> 36438.43s]  What does it take to get you to jump?
[36445.43s -> 36448.93s]  Alright, let's go.
[36448.93s -> 36460.81s]  Here we go! This is it!
[36460.81s -> 36463.81s]  And then it's tap tap, tap tap, tap tap, right?
[36463.81s -> 36470.10s]  Here we go, I'm ready.
[36470.10s -> 36473.66s]  I've been waiting my whole life for this moment.
[36473.66s -> 36478.74s]  Jump, jump, jump.
[36494.91s -> 36512.74s]  Does the other one get to leave too?
[36519.07s -> 36522.07s]  That's freedom.
[36522.07s -> 36525.82s]  We don't get anything from Galefrog?
[36525.82s -> 36528.82s]  The funny thing is that it's there all the time.
[36528.82s -> 36531.82s]  You don't always realize it when you're bogged down
[36531.82s -> 36534.82s]  with so many other things, but you're always free
[36534.82s -> 36537.82s]  as long as you're true to yourself.
[36537.82s -> 36540.82s]  That's where freedom lies, within yourself.
[36540.82s -> 36544.00s]  I wish you and your girlfriend
[36544.00s -> 36547.00s]  the best of luck.
[36547.00s -> 36550.00s]  I wish you as well as you treated me.
[36550.00s -> 36553.00s]  Okay, I must be off.
[36553.00s -> 36556.00s]  My evolution must continue.
[36556.00s -> 36559.43s]  Oh my, I think I know where I am.
[36562.43s -> 36565.43s]  It's all coming back to me.
[36565.43s -> 36568.86s]  This must be Gasey's island.
[36568.86s -> 36571.86s]  Somewhere on this island is a place I have to go
[36571.86s -> 36574.86s]  in order to continue evolving.
[36574.86s -> 36577.86s]  Go find it. You know you're alright.
[36577.86s -> 36580.86s]  Oh, that was really loud, I'm sorry.
[36580.86s -> 36583.86s]  I know we've had our differences occasionally, but
[36583.86s -> 36586.86s]  I like you. You took care of me all this time
[36586.86s -> 36590.17s]  and well, I'm grateful.
[36590.17s -> 36593.17s]  I will kill you first and live very painlessly
[36593.17s -> 36596.17s]  in World War 4.
[36596.17s -> 36600.43s]  Well, say something before I start bawling, won't you?
[36600.43s -> 36603.43s]  I hated every second of our experience together
[36603.43s -> 36606.43s]  that fucking snake and somebody put salt on your balls.
[36606.43s -> 36609.67s]  Hey, listen.
[36609.67s -> 36612.67s]  There's something I'd like to do for you as a kind of
[36612.67s -> 36615.67s]  thank you. It's not much, but I
[36615.67s -> 36618.67s]  wasn't exactly able to head over to a diamond
[36618.67s -> 36621.67s]  and buy you something, now was I?
[36621.67s -> 36624.67s]  It's just something for you to try sometimes.
[36624.67s -> 36627.67s]  Just try tapping on the glass.
[36627.67s -> 36630.67s]  You know, with the right trigger on your control pad.
[36630.67s -> 36635.45s]  Tap, tap, try it sometime.
[36635.45s -> 36638.45s]  Okay, friend, this is it.
[36638.45s -> 36641.45s]  I've really got to go now.
[36641.45s -> 36645.44s]  Take care and if you ever
[36645.44s -> 36648.44s]  want to talk to me, just
[36648.44s -> 36651.94s]  call me, okay? You've been a good friend.
[36651.94s -> 36654.94s]  I'll miss our time together.
[36654.94s -> 36658.50s]  Don't be a total stranger now.
[36658.50s -> 36662.25s]  So confirm with me that it's tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[36662.25s -> 36665.25s]  Tap, tap, tap, tap. Is that correct?
[36665.25s -> 36679.69s]  This is important. Tap, tap, tap,
[36679.69s -> 36682.86s]  tap, tap, tap, tap,
[36682.86s -> 36687.18s]  tap, tap, like this. Tap, tap,
[36687.18s -> 36709.66s]  tap, tap, tap, it's
[36709.66s -> 36721.61s]  tap, tap, tap.
[36735.29s -> 36738.29s]  Tap, tap, tap,
[36738.29s -> 36741.29s]  tap, tap, tap, tap,
[36741.29s -> 36744.29s]  tap, tap, tap,
[36744.29s -> 36747.29s]  tap, tap, tap,
[36747.29s -> 36750.29s]  tap, tap, tap,
[36750.29s -> 36753.29s]  tap, tap, tap,
[36753.29s -> 36756.29s]  tap, tap,
[36756.29s -> 36759.29s]  tap, tap,
[36759.29s -> 36762.29s]  tap, tap,
[36762.29s -> 36765.29s]  tap, tap,
[36765.29s -> 36768.29s]  tap, tap,
[36768.29s -> 36771.29s]  tap,
[36771.29s -> 36774.29s]  tap,
[36774.29s -> 36777.29s]  tap,
[36777.29s -> 36780.29s]  tap,
[36780.29s -> 36783.59s]  tap,
[36783.59s -> 36786.59s]  tap,
[36786.59s -> 36789.59s]  tap,
[36789.59s -> 36793.98s]  tap,
[36793.98s -> 36796.98s]  tap,
[36796.98s -> 36799.98s]  tap,
[36799.98s -> 36802.98s]  tap,
[36802.98s -> 36805.98s]  tap,
[36805.98s -> 36808.98s]  tap,
[36808.98s -> 36811.98s]  oh, why is it so incorrect?
[36811.98s -> 36815.48s]  I can't keep up with
[36815.48s -> 36839.90s]  it, it's so wrong!
[36839.90s -> 36921.63s]  Why tapping?
[36921.63s -> 36924.70s]  Wait, this-
[36976.94s -> 36980.34s]  Did I drop a bug?
[36980.34s -> 36985.97s]  No, whoops.
[36985.97s -> 36993.22s]  I'm pooped. I'm not the sea man I used to be.
[36998.62s -> 37001.94s]  I thought it was fucking over.
[37001.94s -> 37004.63s]  You were wrong!
[37010.61s -> 37015.92s]  What?
[37034.78s -> 37043.08s]  Somebody say you tap with the stairs and you can stop.
[37043.08s -> 37048.26s]  That's weird.
[37048.26s -> 37051.26s]  You understand? Like, there's only two- there's only three different beats!
[37051.26s -> 37053.26s]  There's- like this?
[37054.26s -> 37060.47s]  It's- it keeps fucking up!
[37064.82s -> 37067.82s]  See how it's slowing down? I haven't changed at all.
[37068.82s -> 37072.00s]  Two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
[37072.00s -> 37074.00s]  One, two, three, four.
[37074.00s -> 37076.00s]  One, two, three, four.
[37076.00s -> 37078.00s]  One, two, three, four.
[37078.00s -> 37080.00s]  One, two, three, four.
[37080.00s -> 37082.00s]  One, two, three, four. It's not changing!
[37098.91s -> 37101.22s]  The double beat shit is a J.
[37101.22s -> 37111.38s]  Did you bait?
[37111.38s -> 37113.38s]  I saw all the content already.
[37113.38s -> 37115.38s]  So I'm just being fucking lied to!
[37115.38s -> 37117.38s]  I've seen it all!
[37117.38s -> 37119.38s]  Everyone's fucking with me!
[37119.38s -> 37121.38s]  I've seen it all!
[37121.38s -> 37130.34s]  I thought there was supposed to be a song here!
[37158.62s -> 37162.72s]  Tap three times, then not.
[37162.72s -> 37164.72s]  What are you- what are you talking about?
[37164.72s -> 37177.39s]  Like, it's twice a second.
[37177.39s -> 37183.73s]  So that's- this is two beats a second.
[37183.73s -> 37186.35s]  One, two.
[37186.35s -> 37188.35s]  One, two.
[37188.35s -> 37190.35s]  One, two.
[37190.35s -> 37192.35s]  One, two.
[37192.35s -> 37194.35s]  That's two beats a second.
[37199.47s -> 37201.47s]  Am I never gonna get-
[37201.47s -> 37210.56s]  You understand that-
[37210.56s -> 37212.56s]  I've done it every way!
[37212.56s -> 37214.56s]  I've done it one, two, three, four, five, six.
[37214.56s -> 37216.56s]  One, two, three, four.
[37216.56s -> 37218.56s]  One, two, three, four.
[37218.56s -> 37220.56s]  One, two, three, four.
[37220.56s -> 37222.56s]  One, two, three, four.
[37222.56s -> 37224.56s]  One, two, three, four.
[37224.56s -> 37226.56s]  One, two, three, four.
[37226.56s -> 37229.44s]  I've done it every one of those ways!
[37229.44s -> 37231.44s]  I'm gonna YouTube this shit.
[37231.44s -> 37251.73s]  So I can fucking scream in everybody's face.
[37251.73s -> 37253.73s]  This doesn't even exist.
[37253.73s -> 37259.12s]  That doesn't exist. Nobody's uploaded the end credits to see me in on YouTube. Not one person.
[37259.12s -> 37289.15s]  This fucking shit was- I- I- Do I have to put my live headset on to hear this?
[37289.15s -> 37293.42s]  Fuck! No, it's fine. It's empty.
[37293.42s -> 37301.31s]  Where is my fucking- I don't even know where it is.
[37301.31s -> 37305.90s]  Do I even have- Where the fuck is this?
[37305.90s -> 37307.90s]  I can't believe I'm still fucking doing this.
[37307.90s -> 37314.62s]  What do you mean, have I ever held an instrument before?
[37314.62s -> 37327.50s]  You saw me play Beat Saber like fucking six days ago!
[37327.50s -> 37334.45s]  This one didn't even have the song. This person didn't even do the song.
[37334.45s -> 37348.72s]  This person doesn't even do the song.
[37350.72s -> 37353.22s]  They're not even doing the song!
[37355.78s -> 37365.12s]  Metronome Online.
[37365.12s -> 37370.56s]  How many beats per minute do we want?
[37370.56s -> 37377.22s]  We want 120 beats per minute.
[37377.22s -> 37379.22s]  I was doing- I was doing this shit!
[37379.22s -> 37381.22s]  Are you kidding me?
[37381.22s -> 37391.71s]  Are you- Are you serious?
[37391.71s -> 37394.71s]  By the way, by the way, it's not off, it's not off, it's because-
[37394.71s -> 37398.71s]  Listen, you guys, I-
[37398.71s -> 37400.71s]  Shut this up for a second so I can explain this.
[37400.71s -> 37405.21s]  I have to delay the audio from the capture card.
[37405.21s -> 37410.21s]  So it's 650 milliseconds faster than the game is here.
[37410.21s -> 37411.21s]  Don't you understand?
[37418.06s -> 37420.06s]  This is what I was doing before, you guys can't tell me-
[37420.06s -> 37421.06s]  I'm out of here.
[37421.06s -> 37424.06s]  I was doing that fucking three straight minutes.
[37424.06s -> 37427.64s]  120 beats per minute.
[37427.64s -> 37429.64s]  You tell me this ain't it, I'll do it again.
[37429.64s -> 37431.64s]  Check it out.
[37431.64s -> 37483.80s]  It's so hard to do this when you hear the song because the song is off.
[37483.80s -> 37487.80s]  The song has so many instruments that are playing and you have to pretend to be a metronome.
[37487.80s -> 37489.80s]  I'm gonna have the song in my ear.
[37489.80s -> 37513.57s]  I'm gonna put the metronome on too to see just how fucked up this is.
[37513.57s -> 37515.57s]  And how fucking- how correct I am.
[37515.57s -> 37517.57s]  Check this shit out, you ready?
[37517.57s -> 37522.82s]  Let's hear it.
[37522.82s -> 37524.82s]  Let's get the metronome 120, I'll do it at the exact same time.
[37524.82s -> 37531.66s]  120.
[37531.66s -> 37533.03s]  You ready?
[37533.03s -> 37538.73s]  I have to make- I have to cue the cell.
[37538.73s -> 37541.67s]  Oh fuck, hold on, pause it.
[37541.67s -> 37544.67s]  Would you like to save and end the session?
[37544.67s -> 37550.19s]  So I need to delay this by the same amount of time so you can hear it too.
[37550.19s -> 37552.88s]  There you go.
[37552.88s -> 37553.88s]  It should be cued up now.
[37553.88s -> 37555.44s]  Alright, I'm ready for this.
[37555.44s -> 37561.58s]  I'm ready to fucking show you guys once and for all that I bought bullshit in here.
[37561.58s -> 37568.32s]  Ready?
[37588.08s -> 37589.08s]  Let's go.
[37621.95s -> 37661.15s]  I gotta get out of here, I'm out of here, I'm leaving.
[37661.15s -> 37680.67s]  120 beats per minute.
[37680.67s -> 37681.67s]  Did it work?
[37681.67s -> 37702.71s]  Can I get down?
[37702.71s -> 37716.26s]  You guys are fucking with me, man.
[37716.26s -> 37719.56s]  I've been gone for life for ten and a half hours.
[37719.56s -> 37720.56s]  Yo, you're not on beat.
[37720.56s -> 37723.56s]  How can you not be on beat, you fucking boomer?
[37723.56s -> 37725.99s]  And I'm clearly just going...
[37734.15s -> 37735.15s]  It was clear as day.
[37735.15s -> 37753.46s]  I got my audio set up at 650 milliseconds delayed, camera delayed, audio delayed.
[37753.46s -> 37769.85s]  Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[37769.85s -> 37772.92s]  So the plan is...
[37772.92s -> 37779.30s]  So I'm not gonna be streaming tomorrow, or today.
[37779.30s -> 37786.24s]  Actually, the sus was set for today no stream, but I moved some stuff around, made it possible.
[37786.24s -> 37787.24s]  Hope you had a good time.
[37787.24s -> 37789.12s]  I had a lot of fun.
[37789.12s -> 37793.83s]  That was oddly satisfying video game.
[37793.83s -> 37796.83s]  I mean, near the end though, not really.
[37796.83s -> 37799.33s]  But it still was fun to hang out.
[37799.33s -> 37805.69s]  You guys rock.
[37805.69s -> 37806.69s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[37806.69s -> 37812.49s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday, technically, right?
[37812.49s -> 37813.49s]  Yeah.
[37813.49s -> 37817.65s]  We are going to...
[37817.65s -> 37821.59s]  We are going to speed fire these bits.
[37821.59s -> 37825.15s]  And by speed fire, I mean go through them fairly quickly.
[37825.15s -> 37828.57s]  That was Seaman.
[37828.57s -> 37829.57s]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[37829.57s -> 37830.57s]  See you on Tuesday.
[37830.57s -> 37831.57s]  Thank you, everybody.
[37831.57s -> 37841.32s]  Oh shit, this really was like an 11 hour stream.
[37841.32s -> 37842.32s]  Damn.
[37842.32s -> 37846.82s]  I usually don't stream for more than like seven, six to eight or so.
[37846.82s -> 37849.63s]  Alright, let's go through them real quick.
[37849.63s -> 37853.63s]  Just because we're very kind of pressed for AM time here.
[37853.63s -> 37859.75s]  Let me make sure I have this set up, which I think I do.
[37859.75s -> 37863.34s]  I think I do.
[37863.34s -> 37864.34s]  Why?
[37864.34s -> 37867.98s]  What's going on with my Twitch?
[37867.98s -> 37869.98s]  That's the weird thing.
[37869.98s -> 37875.10s]  Twitch, what is it doing?
[37875.10s -> 37877.92s]  Messed up.
[37877.92s -> 37885.01s]  Messed up.
[37885.01s -> 37890.70s]  And now I can see it.
[37890.70s -> 37891.70s]  Okay.
[37891.70s -> 37893.33s]  Alright.
[37893.33s -> 37895.33s]  Now I can see everybody.
[37895.33s -> 37898.02s]  We had Hawkeye have mine $5.
[37898.02s -> 37899.02s]  Thank you, Hawkeye.
[37899.02s -> 37904.77s]  I'm so excited to watch the streamer milk this stream about orally transmitted Seaman.
[37904.77s -> 37906.77s]  What a dedicated variety streamer.
[37906.77s -> 37908.07s]  Thank you.
[37908.07s -> 37910.07s]  PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $2.50.
[37910.07s -> 37912.25s]  Thanks, PeacefulHaley.
[37912.25s -> 37914.25s]  Was I ever into mystery science theater or rift tracks?
[37914.25s -> 37917.83s]  I was.
[37917.83s -> 37920.83s]  I loved mystery science theater back in the day.
[37920.83s -> 37924.90s]  I have not seen any of the new one, the reboot one.
[37924.90s -> 37932.08s]  But with Mike Nelson, I didn't see this super original MST3K, but I did see the ones with Mike Nelson.
[37932.08s -> 37934.08s]  I was a Mike Nelson fan.
[37934.08s -> 37944.44s]  And then he also said, I want to get into coffee, but every time I take a sip, I feel like I'm going to vomit.
[37944.44s -> 37948.44s]  And I put a shit ton of cream and sugar into it, yet it still tastes gross.
[37948.44s -> 37953.06s]  The thing about coffee is you have to, there's really two ways to drink it.
[37953.06s -> 37962.43s]  It's either just straight up, just take, just drink it black or add milk or I don't adding a ton of sugar and coffee.
[37962.43s -> 37963.43s]  It just makes it.
[37963.43s -> 37967.43s]  Yeah, I don't I don't like adding a ton of sugar and a ton of cream to coffee.
[37967.43s -> 37970.43s]  It makes it weird and tastes like a cake.
[37970.43s -> 37972.43s]  If you can't get into coffee, then just drink tea.
[37972.43s -> 37974.80s]  You know, black tea is probably better.
[37974.80s -> 37976.80s]  You probably like the taste of it more.
[37976.80s -> 37977.80s]  Green tea.
[37977.80s -> 37979.87s]  But have a good night.
[37979.87s -> 37981.87s]  Thank you so much, PeacefulHaley.
[37981.87s -> 37982.87s]  Casey, thanks for the $2.50.
[37982.87s -> 37985.87s]  If you're going to continue with Dreamcast, I recommend Echo the Dolphin.
[37985.87s -> 37991.30s]  I believe I'm going to play Space Channel 5 is still on the menu.
[37991.30s -> 37992.30s]  The original one.
[37992.30s -> 37996.30s]  I have it in the shrink wrap, so that's going to have to be a stream in itself.
[37996.30s -> 37998.99s]  But I never played Echo the Dolphin.
[37998.99s -> 38001.74s]  Fiddy, thanks for five bucks.
[38001.74s -> 38003.74s]  Play the Canada OST.
[38003.74s -> 38008.14s]  Thank you for the five dollars.
[38008.14s -> 38010.14s]  And then Flying Muffin Man, again, a hundred bucks.
[38010.14s -> 38011.14s]  Thank you.
[38011.14s -> 38012.58s]  They said, Hey, the best.
[38012.58s -> 38016.58s]  I don't have the attention span to watch streams often, but it's often a treat to see a new video.
[38016.58s -> 38018.58s]  We caught it late earlier, but thank you.
[38018.58s -> 38020.90s]  Really appreciate it.
[38020.90s -> 38021.90s]  Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[38021.90s -> 38022.90s]  Thanks for tons of money.
[38022.90s -> 38023.90s]  You've given a lot of money this week.
[38023.90s -> 38026.81s]  Something or other.
[38026.81s -> 38027.81s]  Thanks for the $2.50.
[38027.81s -> 38030.81s]  Hey, Germs, I had to go to work last year, so I missed your response.
[38030.81s -> 38033.81s]  Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time out of your day to respond to my message.
[38033.81s -> 38034.81s]  No problem at all.
[38034.81s -> 38036.81s]  And you have another $2.50 here.
[38036.81s -> 38040.81s]  Saying, Secondly, I'm absolutely appalled at your lack of decency and perversion of the truth.
[38040.81s -> 38044.81s]  The people have the right to know the full story of what happened in that Applebee's.
[38044.81s -> 38047.81s]  Yes, I did chew up a bunch of Skittles and spit it in your food.
[38047.81s -> 38052.81s]  But that was because you, they were your Skittles and you kept throwing them at people.
[38052.81s -> 38057.81s]  You kept petting that poor, you kept pelting that poor waiter right in the eyes.
[38057.81s -> 38062.81s]  And when I approached you to ask you to cut it out, you said, I looked like Adam Sandler and I lost my cool.
[38062.81s -> 38064.81s]  I mean, that whole thing was made up.
[38064.81s -> 38069.50s]  You were throwing them at me and my table, trying to get my attention.
[38069.50s -> 38073.50s]  Again, I don't know if you thought it was like hilarious because you kept on going like, stream sniper!
[38073.50s -> 38077.50s]  And you kept throwing and it would hit me in the back of the head and I was ignoring it completely.
[38077.50s -> 38086.94s]  You know, I didn't lose my cool, you did.
[38086.94s -> 38091.44s]  Hey, Hollio, thanks for the holly.
[38091.44s -> 38092.44s]  Thanks for the five bucks.
[38092.44s -> 38096.44s]  Hey, Germa, I'm in Vegas right now for about a month.
[38096.44s -> 38099.44s]  Just saying that if I see you, I'll be sure to give you a good firm handshake.
[38099.44s -> 38101.44s]  And not just German suplex you.
[38101.44s -> 38104.44s]  Please don't German suplex me if I do end up seeing you around.
[38104.44s -> 38109.43s]  If anybody sees me anywhere, please say hello.
[38109.43s -> 38110.99s]  Welcome to Vegas.
[38110.99s -> 38113.68s]  It's a good town, just be careful.
[38113.68s -> 38115.92s]  Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the 250.
[38115.92s -> 38117.92s]  This is actually so damn cute.
[38117.92s -> 38120.48s]  I love you for doing this.
[38120.48s -> 38122.72s]  Seaman is a classic.
[38122.72s -> 38127.61s]  It's great.
[38127.61s -> 38128.61s]  It's so goddamn cute.
[38128.61s -> 38130.61s]  In a very disturbing kind of way.
[38130.61s -> 38133.60s]  But it is still.
[38133.60s -> 38135.60s]  Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.

[38633.90s -> 38642.11s]  lsd oh yeah i ate a pizza on stream it's been a long time it's almost been like a full day
[38642.19s -> 38652.21s]  on stream i forgot that i ate a pizza like four and a half hours ago i ate a whole pizza on stream
[38655.31s -> 38659.95s]  five hours is 24 hours this is what do you mean five hours this is almost 11 hour stream
[38666.91s -> 38681.30s]  five hours i see 1040 am i crazy it's only been 10 minutes no no i don't no i don't count that
[38681.30s -> 38687.47s]  here's why a day to me is not while you're sleeping now sure there are 24 hours in a day
[38687.47s -> 38698.19s]  but when you get up you're usually awake for about 15 to 18 hours right so 24 hours is a whole day
[38698.19s -> 38704.42s]  but you don't you're not awake you're asleep a waking day is you know like vr josh it's about
[38704.42s -> 38711.66s]  16 hours so i've spent almost the entire waking day on stream you know not when you're in bed
[38712.38s -> 38723.78s]  i've said this before and i will reiterate it as many times as i want to i don't know how the
[38723.78s -> 38731.65s]  fuck people do this shit how do you stream because i'm gonna give you some insight here
[38732.37s -> 38736.45s]  when you think about streaming and you think about how you know sitting here in a chair
[38737.01s -> 38740.85s]  with a camera on or with something on the screen and you're talking and you're
[38740.85s -> 38746.05s]  engaging right and for breaks right i maybe i'll go to take a piss like two or three times a stream
[38746.05s -> 38753.65s]  right it's not like oh i'll be back in like 40 minutes right like i'll see you guys in an hour
[38753.65s -> 38760.21s]  how do people sit here and live broadcast and entertain people for 12 straight hours like every
[38760.21s -> 38775.79s]  single day that's i can't even imagine doing that i know and everybody doesn't do that but i know
[38775.79s -> 38796.70s]  there's a lot of people that get come pretty close they do it by being boring oh yeah but if
[38796.70s -> 38801.42s]  even if you're the most you could be sitting there like think about when you guys sit there
[38801.74s -> 38808.99s]  let's just say playing a video game right even sitting down and playing a game for six seven
[38808.99s -> 38814.99s]  eight nine ten hours straight it takes a toll anyways you know even if you were not on a stream
[38814.99s -> 38821.82s]  anyway if you were sitting there just by yourself people do these 24 hour streams they do these
[38821.82s -> 38836.32s]  like marathons sit in the chair for 20 hours i don't know how you function it's just focusing
[38836.32s -> 38845.18s]  on the game and less interactivity well i mean i'm not i'm not dogging it i'm just saying it's
[38846.14s -> 38863.41s]  that's next level to broadcast consistently more than 10 hours of stream i can only go for
[38863.41s -> 38874.67s]  about eight hours straight and i forget to eat yeah interesting stuff but let's keep going
[38874.67s -> 38888.54s]  uh we're getting pretty close i zoned out and played starbound for 19 hours once that's so long
[38890.77s -> 38894.13s]  somebody's gonna you gotta like get unplugged somebody's gonna come into your room and like
[38894.13s -> 38899.17s]  pull the cord out of the back of your computer at that point you're like you have to get like
[38899.17s -> 38906.99s]  woken up you gotta get like shaken awake at that point but bingo sunshine thanks with five bucks
[38906.99s -> 38911.55s]  germ please get a haircut you look tim buckley from the webcomic control i'll delete it's not
