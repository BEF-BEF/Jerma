[0.44s -> 19.45s]  Hey. Good afternoon. How are you? Am I on time finally? You're on time. I'm on time too.
[20.33s -> 26.65s]  Just barely. You were sitting there looking out the window waiting for like the electrician to
[26.65s -> 34.25s]  show up in the window and it was like 358 and you're walking back and forth pacing like this is
[34.25s -> 40.97s]  unfucking believable. Where is he? Should I call? I'm gonna call the manager and you have the phone
[40.97s -> 49.29s]  in your hand and right at 359 the truck pulls up and you're like yeah you made it okay you made it
[51.50s -> 56.22s]  but here's the thing it took me like four or five uh seconds afterwards to put my pants on
[57.50s -> 61.02s]  so I'm like sitting here putting my pants on like getting ready to come in here and I technically
[61.02s -> 81.51s]  it's like it's 402 right now but I the truck pulled up at four get your pants on dude I swear to god
[82.87s -> 87.27s]  so so twitch let me tell you something about like something that doesn't make no sense
[87.27s -> 96.23s]  so if I stream to the test server like the twitch test server I don't I drop like no frames
[97.27s -> 104.07s]  the second I actually press the go live button and stream to the fucking actual twitch I drop a
[104.07s -> 115.61s]  thousand frames what the fuck is this it doesn't make any sense like there's a test server to make
[115.61s -> 123.18s]  sure that your stream is gonna work and instantly I was running that for like an hour and fucking
[123.18s -> 130.76s]  instantly to the same server I actually turned the stream on not going to the test server and
[130.76s -> 139.51s]  10 percent of all stream frames are dropped what they're the same server it's the same so I gotta
[139.51s -> 148.07s]  talk to twitch about this because that doesn't make that make no sense why on earth would I
[148.07s -> 152.71s]  drop the amount of frames that I've dropped in an hour of testing to twitch's server this
[152.71s -> 166.44s]  test server is the same server as the one I'm streaming to right now huh what maybe twitch
[166.44s -> 172.76s]  can help me route it somewhere else oh my god you gotta be fucking kidding me you gotta be
[172.76s -> 182.65s]  fucking kidding me this is really really really fucked up I wish I had any idea why this is
[182.73s -> 188.36s]  happening the second I actually go live
[191.08s -> 200.20s]  it's going to the same place twitch what's happening to me why is this happening it makes
[200.20s -> 213.59s]  no fucking sense nobody can tell me why this is happening well anyways hey I know how to fix
[213.59s -> 220.58s]  this problem hurry up turn on the fucking facecam nobody will remember your your 2000 drop frames
[220.58s -> 242.94s]  in 10 minutes not even five minutes this is like as bad as it's ever been but I got a black t-shirt
[242.94s -> 250.79s]  on what I'm just staring at it for a little bit this is a comb stream so nothing matters today
[251.43s -> 270.01s]  your webcam is 60 fps now I ask because I tweaked it is this stream canon no none of my streams I
[270.01s -> 283.77s]  can't they're all extended universe what the fuck I'm out of here I'm out oh I'm out of here
[302.54s -> 311.58s]  why there's no fucking logical reason for the shit anyways uh hi guys welcome to the stream
[314.18s -> 323.77s]  it's uh with 3000 frames so far to the to the same server I was just streaming to
[324.97s -> 333.62s]  I was just streaming to the Los Angeles server but not broadcasting out to users
[334.50s -> 338.26s]  and I press the fight to delete the fucking test broadcast button
[338.26s -> 353.10s]  and go live with a regular twitch to the same server and it's fucked oh my god
[354.14s -> 366.09s]  would it look good with one of these like let's look like one of these like little hairs
[366.65s -> 381.43s]  I was like what do they call this try it under the nose would I look good with one of these
[386.86s -> 401.86s]  that's like saturday morning cartoon villain whatever was bent a little which fucking like
[401.86s -> 418.12s]  moron Mario uh cousin of mine hold on I ain't gonna I ain't leaving I ain't fucking going
[418.12s -> 427.72s]  anywhere with the power of my mind I'm going to make this work all right I'm gonna like pass
[427.72s -> 439.22s]  myself out uh don't do that it's the Jim Carrey Robotnik but here's the good thing about this
[439.22s -> 446.81s]  though uh this is this is just comb stream so but that doesn't matter I want this to fucking work

[500.07s -> 504.63s]  I don't think I've dropped 4,000 drop frames in two hours last night do you understand how this
[504.63s -> 509.43s]  makes no sense like is anybody in here like a networking person to even describe to me
[510.15s -> 516.23s]  why last night this is not even 24 hours ago it's green for fucking like six hours straight
[516.87s -> 521.19s]  and then now it's it's like it don't even want to breathe it can't even
[521.19s -> 534.26s]  breathe like somebody's strangling it right now it doesn't make any sense an hour at zero

[937.62s -> 940.74s]  and you tell me when you're hearing ready in the chat and I want to say
[941.30s -> 953.66s]  you have to say I heard it ready really do it again ready so this time you're gonna say
[955.26s -> 967.93s]  what okay so uh what what has happened in the time that I have not been here
[970.14s -> 977.27s]  I have done a few things I have downloaded and set up a uh a packet loss prevention
[978.86s -> 999.18s]  VPN and strangely enough I think it worked look at this it's green it's it's green it's been green
[999.18s -> 1007.80s]  for like 25 minutes okay I'm telling you I'm I will tell you the company's name if we okay
[1007.80s -> 1014.36s]  here's the thing right right hold on hold on if we get like a couple days of complete green video
[1016.89s -> 1021.37s]  oh I will but you'll it'll I will give this company as much attention as they want
[1023.32s -> 1030.14s]  I will shake the goddamn CEO's hand on camera I will shake their hand on camera and take like
[1030.14s -> 1043.69s]  fucking president photos with them because seriously like if this works it's been hell
[1043.69s -> 1051.96s]  trying to get this to be fucking fixed it might we may still drop frames but I don't know if
[1051.96s -> 1063.10s]  it'll be as awful as it is I don't know I'm willing to try anything did it cost anything
[1063.10s -> 1070.18s]  it was free to try and the amount of data that I'm going to be obviously pumping through
[1071.30s -> 1081.50s]  it costs money but here's the thing this service is this service is not free after you do it for a
[1081.50s -> 1087.11s]  while actually it's free up to a certain point but let's not talk about let's just let's just
[1087.11s -> 1099.02s]  stream and see what happens let's just do a live stream and see what happens but I will tell you
[1099.82s -> 1109.72s]  it is cheaper than you think it is okay for a whole year of this service it is cheaper than buying
[1109.72s -> 1132.71s]  one Nintendo Wii game if that gives me a green fucking bar for a year that's worth it it is a
[1132.71s -> 1151.38s]  pay service how much is a Nintendo Wii game a Nintendo Wii game is 50 dollars so on in my
[1151.46s -> 1158.22s]  opinion in my opinion what's happening what has been happening well I don't know this this is
[1158.22s -> 1166.38s]  obviously too early to talk about this but if this is fine and it's back to normal then the
[1166.38s -> 1173.96s]  issue is about routing the connection somewhere along the way Cox has these routing fucking
[1173.96s -> 1183.38s]  problems to whatever servers I'm trying to go to but I'm not gonna I'm just gonna let's just turn
[1183.38s -> 1188.10s]  on the let's just go I'm not gonna tweet this out yet because I want to make sure that I'm gonna
[1188.10s -> 1194.71s]  I want like 10 minutes of green I had the exact same problem a couple months ago and my VPN fixed
[1194.71s -> 1204.70s]  my problems too and this is specifically this is a packet loss preventing VPN I don't know where
[1204.70s -> 1215.91s]  the fucking data is going at this point I I could fucking care less where where happens to it I
[1215.91s -> 1223.56s]  I don't care does it work oh hold on a VPN might be like sniffing out I don't get I don't give a
[1223.56s -> 1233.29s]  shit this is a green do we have a green light I didn't get a chance to comb this fucking hair
[1233.29s -> 1242.49s]  once on camera and now it's like it's it's it's too it's it's too like corroded I my hair is too
[1242.49s -> 1255.94s]  corroded it was wet you're giving people your so no it's just it's like what okay it's a credit
[1255.94s -> 1264.95s]  card and it's a service that's reviewed very highly okay this is not a low reviewed service
[1265.83s -> 1280.04s]  it has pretty decent numbers no it's fine it's gonna be fine okay I'm not giving look at this
[1280.04s -> 1285.45s]  hair and I didn't this is supposed to be a comb stream today no drop frames in fucking almost
[1285.45s -> 1293.06s]  10 minutes are you kidding me are you kidding me and I got like a big zit over here that I'm not
[1293.06s -> 1302.14s]  gonna show you you downloaded a virus well this virus sure does make my internet work better
[1302.78s -> 1309.05s]  okay I don't care well what if it's like sniffing out your packets oh good I don't give a shit
[1309.05s -> 1316.33s]  whatever you're gonna see me go to like fucking like my mail and open up like my bank actually
[1316.33s -> 1320.01s]  that's probably bad I'm gonna do okay from now on I'm gonna open up my bank account stuff on my phone

[1336.25s -> 1348.54s]  crazy life but I probably had to just do everything on my like phone now you have protected traffic
[1348.54s -> 1353.66s]  exactly I'm fine everything's fine I am just like kind of I'm pretty manic right now I've got like
[1353.66s -> 1358.14s]  pretty like big I got like mania right now because this is almost 10 minutes of no drop frames
[1359.18s -> 1362.70s]  and it was like 20 minutes of no drop frames before I actually turn the stream I'm going
[1362.70s -> 1373.32s]  through this service and you're not you'll get a name soon you'll get a name soon I don't know
[1373.32s -> 1377.32s]  why I'm holding that I'm holding back the name because if this drops to zero in like the next
[1377.32s -> 1387.91s]  20 minutes and like it didn't even do anything you'll get the name soon don't worry nice hair
[1387.91s -> 1397.54s]  I've it's I've got it all wet and ready get an affiliate affiliate link I don't even know if

[1491.37s -> 1496.09s]  like completely mitigates the problem but you can't have completely perfect internet

[1502.17s -> 1508.01s]  like you know a thousand frames like every like hour or so but that's fine if if this service

[1858.23s -> 1863.11s]  and take care of things right and there's there's like a million there's like millions of customers
[1863.11s -> 1869.11s]  okay so avoiding this showing this is it you're you're very you're very observational uh yes you
[1869.11s -> 1883.70s]  are we're doing the profile today let me just get it out of the way okay there take a screenshot
[1883.70s -> 1902.49s]  of this not take a screenshot of this those are the same people that was the same person
[1907.96s -> 1915.26s]  you have fat don't push me today because i might rip these fucking handles off the chair what kind
[1915.26s -> 1921.82s]  of somebody asked what kind of chair i have i don't know fucking staples whatever it is
[1922.38s -> 1930.95s]  oh anyways okay so the here here is the the the rest of the rest of the pyramid
[1931.75s -> 1934.63s]  that's not to say that this is a pyramid scheme but i'm just saying it's it's like
[1934.63s -> 1940.63s]  shaped that way whatever so you got underneath like the supervising team you've got the guys
[1940.71s -> 1945.27s]  that come out in the truck okay guys that actually fix the nodes and they do the neighborhood work
[1945.27s -> 1948.87s]  and they do the maintenance they they work hard they do because they travel around all over the
[1948.87s -> 1952.79s]  place they've got tons of fucking complaints that's like the supervising team then underneath that
[1952.79s -> 1957.93s]  you've got like the techs that come out to reset your modem that just reset everybody's modem and
[1957.93s -> 1961.13s]  that's all they do they just go out and they go oh i guess i need to reset your modem i think it
[1961.13s -> 1967.94s]  is that that's like down here there's like a lot of that okay underneath that underneath that is
[1967.94s -> 1972.10s]  like the phone support and i'm talking about what people what people can do right i'm not saying that
[1972.10s -> 1978.18s]  like any job is more or less valuable what i'm saying is like the guy in the truck can do way
[1978.18s -> 1984.33s]  more than the person that's on the phone down here right so the person on the phone that you call
[1984.33s -> 1990.42s]  customer support is what they're capable of doing is telling the guy up here to do something about
[1990.42s -> 1996.02s]  it one of the those people here that guy then has to tell somebody up here to get actual do some
[1996.02s -> 1999.70s]  stuff in the truck and get it worked out right that guy then has to talk to one of the fucking
[1999.70s -> 2003.70s]  suit people to find out if they need to do more infrastructural work right that guy then goes
[2003.70s -> 2011.22s]  into the fucking throne room with the guy with the gold throne and he's sitting there like this i
[2011.22s -> 2017.24s]  imagine the ceo just sitting in like a golden throne like like a king and the like peasants have
[2017.24s -> 2025.80s]  to come in and be like so excuse me oh neil before sire uh over on uh in in and bumble dune down the
[2025.80s -> 2035.18s]  street we have um 10 000 dropped frames sire it's hard for us and he just said like 10 000
[2035.18s -> 2043.11s]  drop frames oh that's that's pretty bad but you know over there in in fucking england too whatever
[2043.11s -> 2048.95s]  we're gonna call it i had 25 000 dropped for and they have to make a decision right so then i get
[2048.95s -> 2053.27s]  up and i have like i got like the look i'll do the other side so it makes more sense for you
[2053.99s -> 2061.29s]  sire you have so many dropped frames and my family needs to use the internet and go to amazon
[2061.29s -> 2071.61s]  and buy cases of ocean spray juice because that's and small small figurines of venom we need to and
[2071.61s -> 2080.07s]  then he gets he looks over and he finally makes a decision right so when that determined when that
[2080.07s -> 2084.47s]  person has said it's 20 minutes by the way only 400 drop frames that's not bad so
[2087.38s -> 2095.51s]  my point is the person on twitter i'm talking about what they are capable of doing what they're
[2095.51s -> 2104.55s]  capable of doing if i were to send a tweet to cox customer care twitter or the guy that drives the
[2104.55s -> 2113.54s]  bus down the road i think this person would be able to do more for me that person would come out
[2113.54s -> 2133.77s]  and probably like oh something's wrong there i don't know but i what do you mean all right
[2135.50s -> 2141.98s]  i'm gonna be serious here i'm gonna be real get the comb out of my hair do not leave leave these
[2141.98s -> 2147.34s]  people alone don't do that don't like harass any employee that's not cool don't fucking do that
[2147.34s -> 2155.22s]  you guys are better than that but i really don't think that i that that i have like people up here
[2155.22s -> 2167.19s]  that are currently aware of it my point is is that that process starts all over again the people
[2167.19s -> 2171.99s]  that like are on the phone that are down here somewhere that like have to relay and relay and
[2171.99s -> 2177.83s]  relay i've already done that like seven times we've already relayed to the supervisor to like the
[2177.83s -> 2184.76s]  field supervisor to like the real super like they know they know they know the problem already so i
[2184.84s -> 2190.76s]  going to like the cox customer care twitter is the essentially calling cox customers care
[2191.32s -> 2196.34s]  like on the phone and being like hey uh my internet just turned off for the first time
[2196.34s -> 2201.94s]  there are people up here that already know did you tell them that i'm driven 985
[2203.93s -> 2220.38s]  no have i changed providers i haven't i can't i you can't there's only like two all right so but
[2220.38s -> 2240.49s]  all bullshit aside this is 22 minutes i think i can start this frame now okay so you're saying
[2240.49s -> 2247.27s]  that you don't enjoy it is not it's not let me get this on the screen it has nothing to do
[2247.99s -> 2256.78s]  but the people that are working for cox they can't like there's only so much that they can do
[2257.58s -> 2265.54s]  it's not like their fault it's not their problem it really isn't it's how i've been explained this
[2265.54s -> 2270.42s]  like a thousand times by various people and you know let's just find out who i am as a person
[2271.67s -> 2285.43s]  shall we that's who are you how are we doing we're good i think we're good all right let's

[2299.70s -> 2308.07s]  where is it where's it is it not on screen hello let's find out who the fuck i really am
[2308.81s -> 2331.11s]  that's what this is what we're gonna start with what a transition like i'm fucking like
[2331.11s -> 2336.47s]  unhinged like talking yelling and making noise what kind of poop what kind of personality do i
[2336.47s -> 2346.55s]  have he's already fucking losing his mind all right let's do it i let's move on what do you
[2346.55s -> 2357.37s]  guys think i'm gonna be do chats personality we can do that this is a comb stream and what is
[2357.37s -> 2362.84s]  it how a comb stream works if you if you're brand new to the channel it's just like you know we're
[2362.84s -> 2371.08s]  just like hanging out i don't fucking know okay like look i i just spent the last like 45 minutes
[2371.08s -> 2378.84s]  crying so i'm trying to like get back into into like i'm live mode and sometimes you can't do that
[2379.56s -> 2383.08s]  all right here we go here we go i was just screaming crying into a pillow just give me a
[2383.08s -> 2389.45s]  break here we go i mean i drank all the coffee fast and easy it's gonna take it's gonna take
[2389.45s -> 2395.66s]  like 40 minutes not gonna take 12 i'm gonna answer these questions as truthfully as i can
[2396.78s -> 2410.10s]  okay i'm not gonna bullshit i'm not gonna lie i'm gonna go piece by piece i'm gonna i'm not
[2410.10s -> 2415.37s]  you're gonna get the real me here okay do you enjoy vibrant social events with lots of people
[2415.37s -> 2424.28s]  yes i do i love talking to people i love complaining about the internet to people pretty
[2424.28s -> 2430.12s]  much every conversation i have nowadays with um with other people is about like either like the
[2430.12s -> 2434.12s]  zip that's on my face or about an internet problem that i'm currently having so yeah
[2434.12s -> 2440.54s]  i know i love talking to people i do you often spend time exploring unrealistic yet intriguing
[2440.54s -> 2453.59s]  ideas all the fucking time there are there are streams that i have tried to do that just
[2453.59s -> 2459.70s]  completely unrealistic we're never ever gonna happen but i tried anyways i have like stuff on
[2459.70s -> 2467.03s]  my mouth am i like frothing at the mouth am i like turning into like am i turning rabid
[2468.92s -> 2472.28s]  ow this is what i'm talking about i can't like comb my hair on these streams now
[2473.08s -> 2482.18s]  my hair is turning into like uncooked ramen noodles okay your travel plans are more likely
[2482.18s -> 2492.55s]  to look like a rough list of ideas than a detailed itinerary i i like to have some kind of plan
[2493.27s -> 2500.66s]  but not completely outrageous i feel like i'm getting these wrong because like they're all
[2500.66s -> 2505.74s]  agree all right no no no okay that that's correct i do i like to just kind of go and do i like to
[2505.74s -> 2517.29s]  plan now hold on i plan some stuff but not everything some stuff is is really really
[2517.29s -> 2524.76s]  highly planned and mo i would say more than yeah you often think about what you should have said
[2524.76s -> 2535.42s]  in a conversation long after it's taken place no i don't i don't i don't give a shit i mean i'm
[2535.42s -> 2545.38s]  not one of the okay hold on i'm not one of those people that's just like no because i i look i
[2545.38s -> 2551.61s]  just say the things i say i don't like think about long after their conversations over what
[2551.61s -> 2560.33s]  i should have said no i've just said it what about years later if your friend is sad about
[2560.33s -> 2564.49s]  something your first instinct is to support them emotionally not to try to solve their problem
[2568.97s -> 2574.31s]  well it depends on what they're sad about like okay if it's let's say it's like a like a little
[2574.31s -> 2579.11s]  kid like drops the ice cream on the ground just go i can go get another ice cream and there it is
[2579.11s -> 2585.91s]  and it's not i just solved your problem in a minute right okay what but what if i could see
[2586.63s -> 2600.97s]  that's a bad parent wait what do you mean bad parent hold on so if you're like kid dropped
[2600.97s -> 2607.10s]  the ice cream full ice cream on the ground you wouldn't go get him another one what if they were
[2607.10s -> 2611.90s]  like but i okay what if what if like the worker like didn't get it in there well and it just like
[2611.90s -> 2616.30s]  fell out and like oh god and the work was like oh yeah you're right i didn't secure that i didn't
[2616.30s -> 2637.62s]  secure the ice cream in there good enough the ice what what all right besides that you didn't secure
[2637.62s -> 2646.04s]  the ice cream you have to take them with you to develop what do you what just don't drop it
[2649.93s -> 2656.41s]  because i would buy my son or daughter an ice cream that they dropped on the ground or try to
[2656.41s -> 2665.85s]  get another one that makes me like a crazy person what the fuck are you talking about
[2667.96s -> 2676.76s]  all right but uh i would i would do that first i would just try to support and then maybe like
[2676.76s -> 2694.41s]  how do we maybe fix this right yeah people can rarely upset you it depends on the day because
[2694.41s -> 2699.27s]  like i don't know some days some days somebody could like hit me in the face with a door and
[2699.27s -> 2707.91s]  i'd be like oh oh you know well people are people are blood all over my mouth people are clumsy you
[2707.91s -> 2712.79s]  know it's okay don't worry about that have a wonderful rest of your day you need anything
[2712.79s -> 2719.35s]  like some days it's like that but other days somebody could literally sneeze like 15 tables
[2719.35s -> 2729.90s]  over and i'm just like stop don't fucking sneeze i don't know it got it i caught that you know
[2729.90s -> 2741.45s]  i'm saying it's not like it depends on the day that's probably right in the middle because
[2741.45s -> 2751.27s]  sometimes you just are irritated sometimes you're just like having a good day no it no right in the
[2751.27s -> 2763.10s]  middle all right let's go next page i'm only 10 percent of the way through this it was said 12
[2763.10s -> 2768.94s]  minutes you often rely on other people to be the ones to start a conversation to keep it going no
[2768.94s -> 2774.44s]  strongly disagree i'm always like throwing out fucking shit to talk about i'm always just like
[2774.44s -> 2781.91s]  hey what about this what about that what about this what about that so yeah i i'm always want
[2781.91s -> 2787.98s]  to start conversations if you have to temporarily put your plans on hold you make sure it is your
[2787.98s -> 2806.12s]  top priority to get back on track as soon as possible no unfortunately not that disagree but
[2806.12s -> 2812.39s]  i they come back to normal like they gradually come back you rarely worry if you made a good
[2812.39s -> 2817.11s]  impression on someone you met so like i don't really worry if i make a good impression
[2819.93s -> 2828.23s]  i wouldn't say that's a strong agree because like i i don't know i don't really think about
[2828.23s -> 2832.63s]  that too much but not that completely oh i don't give a shit you know what i mean
[2837.37s -> 2842.92s]  no i think that's correct you always talk about people coming in here for the first time
[2845.32s -> 2850.36s]  this is my first time watching and you suck well that's interesting because you have a four month
[2850.36s -> 2866.58s]  sub badge that would be uh very odd god do you see that vein is that healthy that was big
[2867.14s -> 2870.42s]  that means i'm healthy right that means like there's a ton of blood going up into my brain
[2870.42s -> 2876.79s]  right okay no that's great it would be a challenge for you to spend the whole day
[2877.43s -> 2881.19s]  no it would be a challenge for you to spend the whole weekend all by yourself without feeling
[2881.19s -> 2892.26s]  bored yeah i can't i have to like i feel like it'd be somewhere i have to be with somebody
[2892.26s -> 2901.78s]  something yeah that would be a challenge maybe not that much because sometimes you do
[2901.78s -> 2911.30s]  want some alone time right okay you are more you are more of a detail oriented than a big picture
[2911.30s -> 2922.55s]  person i just i'm a big picture you are very affectionate with people you care about yeah i
[2922.55s -> 2935.66s]  think so somewhere in here you keep asking us about the answers for your personality yeah but
[2935.66s -> 2942.46s]  i mean come on 10 minutes by the way you have a careful and methodical approach to life absolutely
[2942.46s -> 2958.89s]  not you are still bothered by the mistakes you made a long time ago no i no i oh shit strongly
[2959.13s -> 2977.02s]  um what about the book no people you grow you know what i mean you grow you learn you grow
[2977.66s -> 2990.18s]  and you become the person that you are no i i just i kind of disagree at parties and similar
[2990.18s -> 2998.68s]  events you can mostly be found farther away from the action i don't know does this imply like the
[2998.68s -> 3005.67s]  the dance circle at the wedding because like okay there's the i love the dance circle at the wedding
[3006.63s -> 3014.38s]  but i don't really like the when it gets when it gets too crazy you know the dance circle of the
[3014.38s -> 3017.42s]  wedding is fun and then you're like all right i want to go back over to like the bar and just
[3017.42s -> 3023.99s]  sit around and like watch so i don't know probably like right here now jerma lied about the clown car
[3023.99s -> 3036.52s]  just gave five community subs thank you that's five community subs right now it's a fucking lot
[3037.24s -> 3041.70s]  thank you so much jerma lied about the clown car big subs don't look at that
[3042.71s -> 3045.59s]  you often find it difficult to relate to people who let their emotions guide them
[3049.96s -> 3057.06s]  somewhere in the middle because i don't know because like sometimes i think there needs to be
[3057.06s -> 3072.06s]  a balanced approach to stuff like that maybe a slight disagree because um i i i'm i'm fairly
[3072.06s -> 3082.15s]  like emotional for certain things i said don't answer neutral yeah that's right i did one neutral
[3085.43s -> 3092.18s]  i know i'm trying not to answer neutral that i slightly disagree when looking for a movie to
[3092.18s -> 3098.81s]  watch you can spend ages browsing the catalog no nope i just i don't care what it is i'll pick
[3098.81s -> 3104.31s]  something for fun um i here's the thing i actually do this thing this is fun to do
[3104.31s -> 3110.95s]  uh the next time you're on netflix or you're on hulu doesn't matter right a fun uh project is
[3111.59s -> 3115.11s]  to find a movie that you've never seen that you'll never watch that you're like i will never fucking
[3115.11s -> 3120.87s]  watch um i there's no reason why i'm gonna watch uh the other guys too right i'm just i'm not gonna
[3120.87s -> 3125.35s]  i'm not gonna do that there's no reason why i would do it i just i it's not a movie i'm gonna
[3125.35s -> 3131.11s]  pick to watch it's if it's on tv i'm not gonna watch it but what you do is you do the 20 skip
[3131.75s -> 3138.39s]  and how that works is you start the movie and you watch for about 60 to 120 seconds and then you
[3138.39s -> 3145.83s]  skip 20 minutes watch for about 60 seconds skip 20 minutes watch for 60 to 120 seconds skip 20
[3145.83s -> 3153.22s]  minutes and you'll get the essentially the 20 skip of the whole movie and you'll be able to like
[3153.22s -> 3156.26s]  just take it in you'll be able to see at least seven to eight minutes of a movie
[3157.24s -> 3160.44s]  and you're not gonna watch this fucking movie anyways so just have fun and just skip through
[3160.44s -> 3169.19s]  it and just see what they do just look at like the weird shit they do on camera you're fucked up no
[3169.19s -> 3174.23s]  but i'm not gonna watch that movie i'm not going to watch that movie okay think of movies that you've
[3174.23s -> 3179.67s]  scrolled through on netflix that you're just like i will never click that because i'm not gonna give
[3179.67s -> 3186.90s]  an hour and 45 minutes to um what the hell was the name of that movie the last one i did this
[3186.90s -> 3193.94s]  with was uh it was a will ferrell and mark walberg movie and it was uh what the hell was it
[3194.82s -> 3203.26s]  they were like dad dad's home daddy's here dad's home too dad's home too right what was it called
[3205.03s -> 3215.35s]  dad's here what is it called the dad it would where we are where the dad's too
[3219.59s -> 3245.75s]  no somebody knows what this is daddy's home too right no not stepdad um no gibson's in this movie
[3245.75s -> 3261.82s]  i'm pulling that hand away ever so slightly saved daddy's home too okay we're good we're good so
[3261.82s -> 3266.22s]  uh daddy's home too is the last one i did this with and i would do it again because there's no
[3266.22s -> 3272.97s]  way i'm gonna give two hours to daddy's home too i watched like nine minutes of this movie and i
[3272.97s -> 3278.94s]  i feel like i've already seen it there's a dad's home one yeah so no i just pick shit and just
[3278.94s -> 3284.31s]  will watch it for fun sometimes doesn't matter what it is you can stay calm under a lot of pressure
[3284.79s -> 3294.33s]  yeah strongly agree but i can stay real fucking calm now don't say that the internet problems
[3294.33s -> 3298.81s]  are cracking under pressure because the internet okay listen the internet problems
[3299.83s -> 3311.19s]  that's not pressure that is that is like that's not even pressure that is just extreme stress
[3311.19s -> 3317.86s]  you know i'm saying it's not just oh well something's happening today that i gotta be
[3317.86s -> 3323.58s]  calm about this is literally somebody just like throwing darts into your chest for like a year
[3323.58s -> 3328.50s]  eventually you're gonna be like can you stop throwing fucking darts at me like
[3330.46s -> 3335.77s]  you're gonna have like seven okay 700 darts go into my chest this is like getting 700 darts
[3335.77s -> 3341.77s]  thrown at you over the course of a year i i walk out the door like this is a you live a completely
[3341.77s -> 3346.41s]  normal life and i open the door sometimes and there's just the there's the dark guy and he's
[3346.41s -> 3354.26s]  just lining up the shot and you're like okay go ahead and he's just like hold on and it bounces
[3354.26s -> 3356.58s]  it doesn't go it's not gonna he didn't throw it hard enough for it to go and it just hits you in
[3356.58s -> 3361.75s]  the chest and falls down and you have like a mark that happens that by the way this happens like
[3362.70s -> 3371.85s]  two or three times a week after a year you're gonna like kick out the dark guy you're gonna be
[3371.85s -> 3378.82s]  like don't fucking get don't come in my house ever again he's gonna look at you like what don't don't
[3378.82s -> 3383.22s]  leave don't ever come back get the fuck out of my house and he'll just be like with his bag and
[3383.22s -> 3389.18s]  like his bag fucking darts on his back like okay all right bye you'll never see me again and you're
[3389.18s -> 3393.66s]  like yeah get the fuck out of here dart asshole okay fine bye you're never gonna see me again
[3393.66s -> 3400.38s]  the door closes and he's gone by the way two months later um a dart hits your like window
[3400.38s -> 3402.46s]  and you look out you're like that motherfucker and he's just like
[3404.62s -> 3411.70s]  and he fucking runs away he never leaves you alone so after a year of that you're probably
[3411.70s -> 3417.98s]  gonna be pretty annoyed with the dart guy but i mean i yeah i'm pretty good under pressure
[3418.23s -> 3427.10s]  somebody just get 50 bucks who was it don't look at that zip i was ryan hogs gave 50 dollars
[3427.10s -> 3442.70s]  50 bucks slender man kind of quirky kind of hitting that what is this slender man kind of
[3442.70s -> 3451.82s]  quirky kind of hitting that what's that mean i don't know what that is i i i'm not i can't i'm
[3451.82s -> 3464.87s]  not gonna read that i i does that mean anything that's it is taking up 80 percent of your face
[3464.95s -> 3474.79s]  right now why did you read that i don't know what that is somebody could have just
[3474.79s -> 3484.23s]  wrote random fucking words i don't know uh another 50 dollars just came in from frost throw these
[3484.23s -> 3490.79s]  bits are for your funny joke that's 50 bucks from frost uh tro thank you both to the both
[3490.79s -> 3498.94s]  of you there's 100 dollars in fucking two minutes 12 minute test by the way yeah but we have to like
[3498.94s -> 3507.02s]  interact and talk about this i have to go over let me comb my hair for an hour what funny joke
[3507.02s -> 3513.21s]  did i say a joke by the way you can always tell how far back somebody's hairline goes if you really
[3513.21s -> 3523.45s]  pull it that's not that bad i'm 30 fucking four give me a break i'm not like 20 like honest to
[3523.45s -> 3532.63s]  god this hair looks pretty good for a fucking 34 year old man give me some slack seriously you
[3532.63s -> 3541.38s]  know how many fucking 35 year old men i know that that hairline goes back to here i think i deserve
[3541.38s -> 3548.65s]  a little bit of slack it'll okay i'm not and when i'm 40 this will probably be all the way but yeah
[3548.65s -> 3559.10s]  i mean i'll be 40 though whatever you can't look like fucking 25 forever i'm not gonna get me work
[3559.10s -> 3563.59s]  done i mean you know maybe i'll get like you know that's not true maybe i might get like a chin
[3563.59s -> 3571.58s]  implant when i'm like 45 i'm thinking like a like a like a double like a two like a chin implant
[3573.32s -> 3582.12s]  and then like a eyebrow bone implant because i want to look like a banana uh ryan hogs also gave
[3582.76s -> 3587.85s]  five community subs so thank you for that 30 percent of the way for this test by the way
[3589.94s -> 3595.18s]  five more subs come and thank you guys when in a group of people you do not know you have no
[3595.18s -> 3602.41s]  problem jumping right into the conversation i can do that very easily i just go like hey i scroll on
[3602.41s -> 3606.25s]  like this and everybody like notices that you did that and they're like who's this guy was this guy
[3606.25s -> 3610.41s]  funny and then i go kind of and i like get in there and i just start talking about whatever
[3610.97s -> 3614.01s]  you got to get in there like this if you and here's a good icebreaker like oh like we're
[3614.01s -> 3621.29s]  at a party it's like rolling hey everyone's just like oh this guy this guy might be like a funny
[3621.29s -> 3632.06s]  guy don't do that by the way uh when yeah but i can when you sleep your dreams tend to be bizarre
[3632.06s -> 3642.22s]  and fantastical um does this count as like crazy nightmare shit i had a dream a couple nights ago
[3642.22s -> 3649.06s]  that there was this big gigantic thick paint wall of glass and they were like three or four people
[3649.06s -> 3654.34s]  around me then i don't know what they were doing they were like just hanging out right and they
[3654.34s -> 3659.46s]  were taking turns trying to run and jump and break the glass with their bodies this just was this was
[3659.46s -> 3663.85s]  like as big as a whole wall like in like a mural of like just glass i'm just like what the why you
[3663.85s -> 3668.71s]  guys do what are you guys doing they're just like yeah come on man and like running like making a
[3668.71s -> 3673.74s]  dent bang and like the little spider weapon breakout and then finally after like probably
[3673.74s -> 3678.86s]  six or seven more attempts at this one of them actually got through it was like he broke through
[3678.86s -> 3685.46s]  and he fell back and landed and like he got like cuts all over and he was like bleeding he was like
[3685.46s -> 3690.26s]  ah like screaming and like blood was coming out of his back and shit and i was like why why did
[3690.26s -> 3701.00s]  you do that does that count at least nightmares because sometimes they're like that yeah that
[3701.00s -> 3707.46s]  counts in your opinion it is sometimes okay to step on others to get ahead in life well they're
[3707.46s -> 3720.07s]  dialing up the questions into fucked up territory is it sometimes okay to step on others to get ahead
[3720.07s -> 3734.65s]  no it's not do it do it yourself do it yourself don't use people i'm talking more of like like a
[3734.65s -> 3743.16s]  strict like in in the in a don't use people don't like just step on somebody to get to the top
[3743.16s -> 3749.72s]  now get to the top on your own get to the top because you you belong at the top right you know
[3749.72s -> 3760.15s]  you know what i'm saying get to the top because like you belong at the top you know what i mean
[3760.15s -> 3765.85s]  i'm kidding i'm kidding jesus you are dedicated and focused on your goals only rarely getting
[3767.21s -> 3772.39s]  i don't need to even talk about that one if you make a mistake you tend to start doubting yourself
[3772.39s -> 3779.02s]  your abilities or your knowledge no i typically take take a mistake and turn it into something
[3779.02s -> 3785.05s]  else that works when at a social event you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people
[3785.05s -> 3790.66s]  and mostly talk to the ones you already know that's that's pretty that's kind of true i think that's
[3790.66s -> 3801.13s]  true for everybody though most people don't just go walk up to strangers and do the fucking thing
[3801.13s -> 3808.95s]  that i told you not to do people don't really do that if i if i would be introduced to somebody
[3808.95s -> 3815.02s]  from somebody else then that's a completely different story but typically you just kind of
[3815.02s -> 3823.90s]  hang out with the people that you were there with yeah that's accurate you usually lose interest
[3823.90s -> 3833.88s]  in a discussion when it gets philosophical ah that's like fun to do that's fun to do sometimes
[3834.52s -> 3848.41s]  i'm all about like hypotheticals and stuff it's fun you would never let yourself cry in front of
[3848.41s -> 3862.31s]  others no i've i've done it in front of you i've literally cried on this stream like twice you've
[3862.31s -> 3871.93s]  seen me cry twice for very different reasons by the way you feel more drawn to places with
[3871.93s -> 3881.98s]  a bustling and busy atmosphere than quiet and intimate ones yeah lash vegas come on you like
[3881.98s -> 3886.30s]  discussing different views and theories on what the world could look like in the future oh yeah
[3887.75s -> 3893.82s]  you know is a robot's gonna take over we've had these conversations over the stream what's gonna
[3893.82s -> 3900.41s]  happen in 500 years are they gonna write books about this yeah all the time when it comes to
[3900.41s -> 3906.31s]  making life-changing choices you mostly listen to your heart rather than your head yeah sometimes
[3909.99s -> 3922.10s]  yeah yeah you cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you
[3922.10s -> 3934.65s]  cannot see touch or experience probably probably because i would get i would get lost i'd get lost
[3937.14s -> 3950.65s]  yeah that i'll get lost comedy oh wait i thought they were talking about like oh yeah you're right
[3950.65s -> 3960.39s]  okay but is that comedy that that's something there's no study of comedy oh what are you what
[3960.39s -> 3968.42s]  are you doing in college oh i'm a comedyologist that no you just kind of you don't like study
[3968.42s -> 3984.73s]  dedicating your life to the study of something you can experience comedy yeah but experiences at the
[3984.73s -> 3991.37s]  end that you cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you
[3991.37s -> 3998.33s]  cannot see touch or experience i'm gonna go with i'm gonna go with this group because
[3999.21s -> 4012.57s]  i guess like comedy is like a thing i guess right there's no or here it's not the study of
[4012.57s -> 4021.42s]  or the experience of it's just the study of it's very clearly not meant as comedy yeah it is it's
[4021.42s -> 4028.33s]  like it's like what they're talking about here is they're talking about like religion and that's
[4028.33s -> 4045.29s]  mainly i'm assuming what they mean by this yeah what about physics particle physics yeah but the
[4045.29s -> 4051.58s]  particles exist okay you usually prefer to get your i thought that said massage you usually
[4051.58s -> 4056.70s]  prefer to get a massage rather than i'm like wait what usually prefer to get your revenge rather
[4056.70s -> 4070.10s]  than to forgive i've never like had to get i've never like had like revenge though before
[4077.00s -> 4093.30s]  revenge when have i ever had to get like revenge like maybe in like a video game world no i don't
[4093.30s -> 4099.42s]  know you make decisions on a whim all the time the time you spend by yourself often ends up being
[4099.42s -> 4103.74s]  more interesting and satisfying than the time you spend with other people it really depends but for
[4103.74s -> 4112.84s]  the most part no somewhere in here you often put social special effort into interpreting the real
[4112.84s -> 4123.48s]  meaning or the message of a song or a movie hmm that's tough i don't really think i do that
[4123.48s -> 4131.88s]  though no because every time i watch a movie that confuses me i just find the subreddit that the
[4131.88s -> 4146.26s]  movie is based on and read ending explained what did mean when explained and i just look at
[4146.26s -> 4150.58s]  somebody on reddit has like two paragraphs that explains literally everything you ever want you
[4150.58s -> 4158.74s]  go oh yeah okay cool so i don't like sit in a chair and have like a pipe in my mouth just sitting
[4158.74s -> 4165.40s]  there like hmm what happened in that tv show no somebody else will tell me no i don't
[4167.77s -> 4172.41s]  he trusts reddit no i'm just saying like it's somebody else like already somebody else already
[4172.41s -> 4177.61s]  has this is the thing about the internet and pretty much this is how it works somebody on
[4177.61s -> 4182.82s]  the internet figured it out already if this is something that you think that like hey wait
[4182.82s -> 4186.90s]  hold on is that what is that what's what happened in that movie i think no no somebody already
[4186.90s -> 4192.02s]  figured it out there are people that figured out the end of like every tv show and every like movie
[4192.10s -> 4200.76s]  in every book like years before they were even done so they already they said somebody else has
[4200.76s -> 4204.65s]  already figured it out that's why i just don't even use the internet if you're ever going to
[4204.65s -> 4209.70s]  watch a movie just don't go on the internet you always know exactly what you want no i don't
[4209.70s -> 4213.46s]  you rarely think back on the choices you made you rarely think back on the choices you made
[4213.46s -> 4219.78s]  and wonder what you could have done differently rarely look back so like i don't typically look
[4219.78s -> 4226.07s]  back and see what i could have done no i do i do you always try to figure out like uh it would
[4227.69s -> 4237.29s]  no i can't pick the middle one because this website hates me no i don't that often maybe
[4237.29s -> 4246.12s]  like once in a while no no i don't i usually just kind of stick with whatever happens
[4248.49s -> 4254.74s]  yeah i do when in a public place you usually stick to quieter and less crowded areas
[4255.80s -> 4262.47s]  no i usually like the hustle and bustle you tend to focus on present realities rather than future
[4262.47s -> 4269.99s]  possibilities no i'm always trying to think of like what cool thing could i try or do in the
[4269.99s -> 4279.14s]  future you often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings no when starting to work
[4279.14s -> 4299.11s]  on a project you prefer to make as many decisions upfront as possible some it really depends on what
[4299.11s -> 4309.88s]  they what what the thing is though no i do when you know someone thinks highly of you i mean like
[4309.88s -> 4314.92s]  all of you everyone here you also wonder how long it will be until they become disappointed in you
[4321.18s -> 4330.47s]  we actually talked about this like two days ago i don't give a shit about what people think about
[4330.47s -> 4337.48s]  me i give a shit what everybody thinks about me about flippy floppy no but that's different
[4337.48s -> 4343.18s]  though that's different because i thought when you know someone thinks highly of you this is
[4343.18s -> 4347.82s]  not flippy floppy because when this is a word differently when you know that somebody thinks
[4347.82s -> 4353.05s]  highly of you you also wonder how long it'll be maybe if the big yeah no that absolutely
[4353.77s -> 4357.61s]  because you want you want to make sure that they still think you're like cool they still like you
[4357.69s -> 4363.11s]  that they still happen like a good time yeah you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you
[4363.11s -> 4369.99s]  find interesting and striking a conversation no i don't here's the thing about walking up to
[4369.99s -> 4375.86s]  somebody and like starting a conversation everybody has this thing in their head of the conversation
[4375.86s -> 4382.34s]  that they're gonna have and it's usually the first like three sentences everybody blocks out the
[4382.34s -> 4387.06s]  first like two or three sentences and then after you have your pre-planned like two sentences that
[4387.06s -> 4397.45s]  you're gonna say uh-oh there's nothing else here um so like for instance right like oh hey you
[4397.45s -> 4402.57s]  notice that oh somebody's somebody likes garbanzo beans at the grocery store i love garbanzo beans
[4402.57s -> 4406.17s]  hey i love garbanzo beans those are really delicious here's like i got an interesting
[4406.17s -> 4411.69s]  recipe for like hummus that you could try okay cool hey uh those that's the best brand i usually
[4411.69s -> 4416.41s]  buy that bread it's a good one you're big i'm big fan of garbanzo beans too i got a recipe for hummus
[4416.41s -> 4433.30s]  that got my grandmother passed down to me okay i gotta go bye what do you do like everyone has
[4433.30s -> 4448.09s]  the two sentences ready okay let's go no i do not you often drift away to daydreaming but very oh
[4448.09s -> 4468.76s]  yeah you look after yourself first and others come in second hmm there's a reason yeah secure
[4468.76s -> 4481.91s]  your own oxygen mask first before helping others i just read that somewhere probably on reddit
[4481.91s -> 4496.17s]  no you can all right for me listen listen for me to be able to look after somebody else
[4497.05s -> 4501.53s]  i need to be capable of doing that i have to be kind of in the right mindset i've got to be
[4501.53s -> 4506.97s]  in a good spot i gotta be okay with me before i can be okay telling somebody else what to do
[4506.97s -> 4518.22s]  you know what i mean take care of yourself first make sure you are good because how can you expect
[4519.96s -> 4527.26s]  to like take care of somebody else if you're not kind of locked in on yourself you know what
[4527.26s -> 4530.38s]  i'm saying like think about that put your own oxygen mask on first got that on reddit
[4533.98s -> 4538.22s]  even when you have planned a particular daily routine you usually just end up doing what you
[4538.22s -> 4550.68s]  feel like at any given moment yeah self-absorbed streamer steals oxygen masks and claims they
[4550.68s -> 4560.33s]  belong to him if you have you have you ever been on a fucking airplane have you never been on an

[4897.24s -> 4903.08s]  minutes yeah i can go all over the place you often contemplate the reasons for human existence and
[4903.08s -> 4911.05s]  the meaning of life no that's too much to think about once you start thinking about that shit
[4911.69s -> 4919.14s]  you start to you go down like the path and you're just like wait a minute what the fuck is this why

[5020.18s -> 5027.69s]  dwell on your regrets no like i told you before you gotta you grow spending time in a dynamic
[5027.69s -> 5031.37s]  atmosphere with lots of people around quickly makes you feel drained and in need of a getaway
[5032.57s -> 5044.65s]  i like going out with people you see yourself as more of a realist than a visionary it's like that
[5044.65s -> 5050.39s]  you know what i mean like if my if your brains are all in here my brain's in here but like it
[5050.39s -> 5060.62s]  occupies like this that's not saying i'm smart that's saying that whatever like like low iq
[5060.62s -> 5065.74s]  idiocy that's in here is not like densely packed into the brain it's like up like as an aura around
[5065.74s -> 5072.78s]  like all over here i got a pretty decent iq though you've already proved that you find it easy to
[5072.78s -> 5084.28s]  empathize with the person who has gone through something you never have that's hard to do you
[5084.28s -> 5100.65s]  like to try you like to try i wouldn't say that's i i disagree that much on that because everybody
[5100.65s -> 5108.33s]  has such different experiences you know if you have an experience and i have an experience and
[5108.33s -> 5115.29s]  it's completely different like the common ground is you know something you have to reach kim's

[5196.71s -> 5202.79s]  personal work style is closer to spontaneous bursts of energy yes than to organize consistent
[5202.79s -> 5209.91s]  efforts first bursts of random energy that's why sometimes i don't stream i don't have a schedule
[5209.91s -> 5220.49s]  right so like sometimes i it's like oh today i'm today i'm ready right let's go your emotions
[5220.49s -> 5236.90s]  control you more than you control them sometimes sometimes no we're good we're good don't worry

[5525.24s -> 5532.94s]  hold on let's just get the tldr the campaigner personality is a true free spirit they're often
[5532.94s -> 5540.76s]  the life of the party but unlike types in the explorer role group campaigners are less interested
[5540.76s -> 5544.84s]  in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in the enjoying the social and
[5544.84s -> 5552.04s]  emotional connections they make with others charming independent energetic and compassionate
[5552.04s -> 5555.72s]  the seven percent of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd

[5593.27s -> 5605.26s]  more than stability and security they crave creativity and freedom yeah don't lose that
[5605.26s -> 5617.06s]  little spark of madness wait what do you mean madness it's all right the care the campaigner
[5617.06s -> 5623.54s]  personality type needs to be careful however if they rely too much on their intuition assume or
[5623.54s -> 5628.66s]  anticipate too much about a friend's motivations they can misread the signals and frustrate plans
[5628.66s -> 5634.10s]  that a more straightforward approach would have made simple this kind of social stress is the
[5634.10s -> 5640.74s]  bug bear that keeps harmony focused diplomats awake at night campaigners are very emotional
[5640.74s -> 5651.26s]  and sensitive and when they step on someone's toes they both feel it what's a bug bear all right

[6406.09s -> 6410.33s]  psychotic from non-psychotic thinking in cases where the patient is reluctant to openly admit
[6410.33s -> 6416.34s]  to psychotic thinking what um all right i thought this was just like what do you think this image is

[7214.65s -> 7220.39s]  same jelly belly bag i think i got i got some jelly bellies for christmas like two or three
[7220.39s -> 7229.38s]  years ago and i think i still have it yeah i'm not a fan and plus the toasted marshmallow is

[7271.40s -> 7277.00s]  we know when you have like the nesquik powder right you got the nesquik powder when it's empty
[7277.00s -> 7281.40s]  just like smell inside of that that's what a rese not a rese that's what a tootsie roll tastes like
[7284.02s -> 7292.50s]  a tootsie roll tastes the way that an empty nesquik container smells let's go up here and
[7292.50s -> 7299.86s]  butterfingers are too hard to eat when you bite into a butterfinger it just like gets all of your
[7299.86s -> 7311.88s]  teeth you have to sit there and go like all day they taste really good but you have to go into
[7311.88s -> 7317.40s]  every single crevice of all of your molars with like a pickaxe even if you brush your teeth a
[7317.40s -> 7324.63s]  butterfinger is still there i have an electric toothbrush that goes at like 500 milliseconds of
[7324.63s -> 7335.51s]  a minute whatever it's like and i it doesn't work i've eaten a butterfinger before and done
[7335.51s -> 7342.23s]  my super toothbrush and there's still like deposits of fucking butterfinger gold in my teeth
[7342.95s -> 7355.24s]  they still taste good but you can't i don't like to eat them all the sour shit goes down somewhere
[7355.24s -> 7367.18s]  at the bottom for me sour patch kids airheads may even be made out of plastic i don't know what
[7367.18s -> 7375.90s]  are they made out of once you okay there's like chocolate caramel and then this could be plastic
[7383.05s -> 7398.92s]  i like nerds though kitkats we'll fix this jolly ranchers are oh they're okay but i don't know
[7398.92s -> 7408.54s]  they fit in that weird category of you don't you can't have more than one and plus you can always
[7408.54s -> 7415.85s]  tell when somebody has a jolly rancher in their mouth because you can hear it it's how do i do
[7415.85s -> 7424.47s]  this without putting something gross in my mouth it's like you i can't how do i do this how do i
[7424.47s -> 7430.70s]  i was gonna put a coin in my mouth but i have not cleaned those coins actually i got it this is what
[7430.70s -> 7457.96s]  it's like when somebody's eating a jolly rancher what's up i don't like it but i'm sorry bottom
[7457.96s -> 7473.10s]  tier both almond joy and whiz mounds not very good i just did not very good i can't i don't
[7473.10s -> 7478.94s]  really love it you guys always talk shit about boomers this is the ultimate i'm a boomer and
[7478.94s -> 7490.44s]  here's the thing i like to eat this is the boomer candy it is it no that is that is it just is you
[7490.44s -> 7494.20s]  can like it but like my grandfather probably thinks this is great but i don't really like it
[7499.40s -> 7509.08s]  i can't place these yet snow caps are kind of gross what was the last time you even had a snow
[7509.08s -> 7518.02s]  cap i think the last time i had a snow cap i think i was watching toy story 2 in the movie theater
[7518.66s -> 7530.22s]  this is the last time i ate one oh what are these dairy milk spree fun dip
[7530.78s -> 7546.12s]  it's pez why are there two skittles no not naturally crunch is pretty good i'm not sure
[7546.12s -> 7555.34s]  i would put it above like Reese's Pieces though pez's shit yeah tell you tell me pez's shit
[7556.30s -> 7563.82s]  when you know that pez is like Campbell's soup you could literally eat it forever it doesn't
[7563.82s -> 7569.75s]  ever go bad does it am i making that up i made that up i don't know i might have just made that
[7569.75s -> 7583.27s]  up i don't like i'm not a it's all right i'll say the the snickers bar is not very good to me
[7583.91s -> 7598.02s]  but the mini snickers the mini little ones are up here so i'm gonna average that out
[7598.02s -> 7603.69s]  Cadbury eggs are down here it's too heavy better than sweet tarts it's the same thing it's not the
[7603.69s -> 7608.63s]  same thing it's completely different they they both have different textures they're just different
[7608.63s -> 7615.59s]  it's different because when you bite down on a snickers you bite through and there's the only
[7615.59s -> 7620.71s]  one end of the chocolate you get when you have a mini snickers you get all four corners of the
[7620.71s -> 7632.26s]  chocolate it encompasses it surrounds the whole bar it's better it just is you get four corners
[7632.34s -> 7637.94s]  of the coated chocolate on a mini snickers big snickers bite through one of those ends is like
[7637.94s -> 7644.95s]  peanuts and gravy whatever it is uh it's that's not the same somebody just said negative iq
[7647.05s -> 7655.86s]  some of you guys understand what i'm saying here you do Mike and Ike's that's D
[7664.07s -> 7675.21s]  these are disgusting i it's cinnamon i don't like this it's what it is it's just cinnamon 3.0
[7677.38s -> 7683.38s]  all the fireball is is just like this weird overly spiced latte cinnamon shit
[7684.60s -> 7689.48s]  i don't like it plus people drink this stuff as alcohol and it's i've had it makes me sick
[7690.20s -> 7707.46s]  what are these gumballs oh sprees sprees are the little chewy i gotta get this right right
[7707.46s -> 7711.94s]  sprees are the little chewy uh discs that have that really sour fruity kind of taste
[7717.02s -> 7722.98s]  i'm gonna make sure i get this right yes okay they go they go up here they have a little chewy
[7723.06s -> 7731.05s]  discs they remind me of mentos the fruit ones the fruit mentos but like a way better version of the
[7731.05s -> 7745.24s]  fruit mentos where why are fruit mentos not on here it's strange candy corn just should never
[7745.24s -> 7750.44s]  be eaten it's a decoration i wouldn't put a decoration in my mouth so why would i put that
[7750.44s -> 7757.46s]  in my mouth i'm actually kind of upset that one of my favorite candies is where's um where's three
[7757.46s -> 7765.74s]  musketeers three musketeers are one of my absolute favorite candies it would be up here
[7766.46s -> 7781.37s]  this is bullshit can i pretend one of these is three musketeers it's in the trash no it's not
[7784.17s -> 7789.78s]  lemon heads they're i don't they're on the same tier as like jolly ranchers and airheads that's
[7789.78s -> 7804.65s]  that same theory there are two pockies pixie sticks gross well hershey's kisses
[7806.09s -> 7824.33s]  huh hershey's kisses are actually kind of good but but they that good no these are warheads
[7824.97s -> 7833.99s]  the sour cave never had warhead before um i would put warheads up at s tier but you honestly only
[7833.99s -> 7839.99s]  eat one of these once every few years and you go oh wow that was crazy but that sucked i don't want
[7839.99s -> 7847.69s]  to do that again but you have this weird memory that you liked them i have a memory right now of
[7847.69s -> 7853.42s]  those being s tier but they're not at all they're just they're horrible why is it that every time
[7853.42s -> 7858.22s]  you see this at the store you go oh warheads oh cool man warheads and you buy them and you
[7858.22s -> 7865.53s]  fucking hate them every time so like in your mind they're up here but in reality they're probably
[7865.53s -> 7880.12s]  down here and that's a chad candy it's because of nostalgia nostalgia nostalgia am i saying that
[7880.12s -> 7890.74s]  word right nostalgia am i saying that correct why does it sound weird saying that no nostalgia
[7891.48s -> 7899.75s]  nostalgia that sounds odd now i can't say it anymore i don't like i mean pocky is
[7900.31s -> 7904.07s]  and i have only had it a few times but it's just like oh it's okay it's like i wouldn't choose it
[7904.63s -> 7917.78s]  it's better than warheads though it's probably it's better than butterfingers it is this is not
[7917.78s -> 7922.98s]  final just this is hope everyone's freaking out this is not a final list this is a general idea
[7923.94s -> 7934.55s]  and then we go from here dots okay dots are the equivalent to me of finding gum under a seat
[7941.43s -> 7951.14s]  sorry they're always okay why is it that dots are always seem to be stale
[7952.68s -> 7957.74s]  their dots are the stale bread of the candy world you put one in your mouth and it's like
[7959.19s -> 7962.79s]  took a little while to go through it almost feels like it gave you way too much give
[7963.59s -> 7972.15s]  it's not soft not a fan i also am going to make people pissed off here i really hate
[7972.15s -> 7979.62s]  twizzlers i think that they don't taste like anything it's just like it doesn't it i it's
[7979.62s -> 7987.80s]  like that weird taste it doesn't it doesn't do anything for me they taste like artificial
[7989.10s -> 7995.38s]  like i don't know how let me try to describe this i'll get it hold on let me use my visionary brain
[7995.38s -> 8004.28s]  um twizzlers are like the only thing that's fun to do with a twizzler i got it it's in my brain
[8004.28s -> 8011.40s]  i'm pulling it out somebody get like the fucking wand when you bite off both ends of a twizzler
[8011.40s -> 8016.28s]  and then you stick that into a drink and you drink up the drink with the hole in the twizzler
[8017.40s -> 8030.73s]  that's it there's no other reason to eat them in my opinion they're just chewy gamey it's okay
[8030.73s -> 8038.06s]  twizzlers are like the lamb of the kingdom that means it would be not that's way off it's like
[8038.06s -> 8047.80s]  chewy and gamey and i can't describe it you know what i mean they're not they're not good m&m's
[8050.57s -> 8054.89s]  nobody want nobody orders m&m's i'm doing this based on like if i was at a candy store what would
[8054.89s -> 8072.10s]  i get there are m&m's everywhere there are too many m&m's m&m's are the ant of the candy animal
[8073.72s -> 8080.66s]  they're just everywhere why am i doing these like weird analogies here there's so many m&m's
[8082.36s -> 8099.16s]  there are more m&m's than people on earth yeah i think that's true they're better than swedish
[8099.16s -> 8105.08s]  fish i feel the same way swedish fish and twizzlers are the same kind of flavor profile
[8105.08s -> 8113.91s]  for me and these also swedish fish also you open a bag and sometimes they just taste like stale
[8113.91s -> 8119.16s]  it's hard to like you you have to eat the whole bag in the first day i do they taste stale they
[8119.16s -> 8127.48s]  think hard to bite through i can't be the only person that thinks this i can't be crispy m&m's
[8127.48s -> 8133.58s]  are s tier uh peanut butter m&m's are way up here but regular m&m's are not i don't think
[8138.66s -> 8146.81s]  i'm beyond wrong uh laffy taffy if this was saltwater can i pretend this is something else
[8148.12s -> 8151.72s]  because i have to tell you my s tier candy can i pretend these are something else
[8154.46s -> 8158.78s]  no can i how can i how do i pretend let me just pretend these are something else
[8161.67s -> 8169.69s]  saltwater taffy is is s tier is the best candy ever nice soft delicious saltwater taffy is s
[8171.37s -> 8174.73s]  so but can i pretend that's what that is i don't want laffy taffy that's like the
[8174.73s -> 8183.69s]  fucking joke brand add images well i don't have an image of saltwater taffy i'm like
[8183.69s -> 8201.10s]  it's not my desktop background i don't like uh wafers either here's another one that you only
[8201.10s -> 8215.72s]  eat at a movie theater then they have that kind of they have that malty taste to them don't they
[8218.76s -> 8233.00s]  what is that i don't is that that weird like coated sour straw stuff double bubble
[8233.00s -> 8244.25s]  it's going up here i remember if you were like really good in class a teacher of mine would give
[8244.25s -> 8252.63s]  a double bubble you got like an a on a test there you go there's a double bubble for you
[8254.41s -> 8262.94s]  all gum is what it tastes good for one second better than bubble tape bubble tape is down here
[8263.58s -> 8279.34s]  double bubble is better than bubble tape look bubble look at look bubble tape oh i'm so old
[8279.34s -> 8295.43s]  bubble tape is old too that's boomer gum bubble tape is old they ran an entire commercial campaign
[8295.43s -> 8301.06s]  guys 20 years ago about how bubble tape was not supposed to be eaten by old people they did a
[8301.06s -> 8306.90s]  whole ad campaign with it was like the same like old librarian looking lady that would like be
[8306.90s -> 8311.62s]  going like dish into the camera and stuff and it was like skateboards and it's for you not them
[8313.05s -> 8320.63s]  bubble tape it's six feet of bubble gum for you not them that was the commercial so that was 20
[8320.63s -> 8343.42s]  years ago just wait better than pes i've just let me get these up here the rest of these are
[8343.90s -> 8352.04s]  i don't like those tootsie pops are much better than tootsie rolls because there's a new there's
[8352.04s -> 8366.66s]  a new thing there there there's like a variable included here do i like tootsie pops better than
[8366.66s -> 8378.09s]  sweet tarts i'll figure that out later mr good bar is interesting because uh i don't have any
[8378.09s -> 8385.11s]  memories of eating this but i've eaten a bunch of times this is the memory wipe candy because
[8385.11s -> 8401.42s]  nobody knows or can remember what this tastes like i know it's good this is one with a little
[8401.42s -> 8415.00s]  crunchies in it it's got the little crunchies in it right it's kind of like um is it peanuts
[8415.00s -> 8425.64s]  it's is it's it's peanuts it's some it's peanuts and something else though can we pretend this is
[8425.64s -> 8442.38s]  three musketeers what are these no no i'm thinking a crackle okay yeah you're right that is that i am
[8442.38s -> 8458.02s]  thinking a crackle oh dumb dumb these are little lollipops i love these these go up here dumb
[8458.02s -> 8464.92s]  dumbs are fucking awesome it's the perfect amount of lollipop they're this big they're like tiny
[8464.92s -> 8472.46s]  they're like this they're miniscule you just put it in your mouth it just sits in there that's the
[8472.46s -> 8478.46s]  doctor's office lollipop no no no no the doctor's office lollipops are flat those are the little
[8478.46s -> 8486.44s]  round ones yeah no no this place is i love it yeah definitely up there little dumb dumbs oh
[8486.44s -> 8495.94s]  you like dumb dumbs because you heard dumb dumb let's say that uh lifesavers should be up here
[8495.94s -> 8501.48s]  but they're not because they hurt lifesavers do this thing where after they're one of them's
[8501.48s -> 8506.58s]  in your mouth for more than um like 10 minutes or so and it gets to be really thin it starts
[8506.58s -> 8514.50s]  to become a knife that like pierces you and stabs you they don't dissolve fast enough they just
[8514.50s -> 8522.10s]  turn into weapons in your mouth and then if it gets to that point where you were oh this is
[8522.18s -> 8527.78s]  getting really kind of small now i need to break it it's like biting on glass and you like have
[8527.78s -> 8535.86s]  to be real careful they're good though they have a good flavor i would probably rather have a
[8535.86s -> 8552.52s]  lifesaver than a skittle what is this uh haribo i don't like gummy bears i wouldn't put these
[8552.52s -> 8556.76s]  i'd put gummy bears over okay i'd rather have a gummy bear than a hershey's kiss
[8557.48s -> 8578.18s]  the what was that like the the explosion here i just don't eat gummy bears a gummy bear
[8581.18s -> 8588.66s]  i that they're the these two are the same thing one of them you can chew through the other one
[8588.66s -> 8601.99s]  just is clangs around in your mouth these are the same flavor what i mean wrong despite i'm not done
[8605.02s -> 8613.18s]  i'm trolling i don't like gummy bears i don't i don't like gummy bears i don't like to eat
[8613.18s -> 8618.58s]  gummy bears i don't like gummy bears i'm not trolling everybody i just don't like gummies
[8618.58s -> 8626.26s]  i like peanut butter and chocolate and bubble gum i don't like gummy bears are we really gonna
[8626.26s -> 8631.24s]  do a fucking green eggs and ham segment with you guys here will you follow me around and i try to
[8631.24s -> 8642.18s]  get me to eat them and i tell you no plus i've had gummy bears before that this is like the
[8642.18s -> 8646.58s]  mcdonald's bread oh shit i can't say that i just probably made a lot of people this is like the
[8646.58s -> 8655.11s]  coca-cola of gummy bears right if you go into a candy store and they have like a local kind
[8655.11s -> 8661.75s]  of gummy bear usually they're much better terrible aren't they like the gummy they're like the
[8661.75s -> 8669.61s]  coca-cola kind of pepsi of gummy bears that's that's real right there are a lot of candy shops
[8669.61s -> 8673.45s]  that make their own gummy bears or they pull them in from some candy store and they're way better
[8678.06s -> 8681.42s]  i've had gummy bears before that were like oh those are fucking really really good
[8681.42s -> 8690.28s]  but not like that is the bag from the store should i pretend that these are not haribo
[8691.08s -> 8695.48s]  should i think that they are like other gummy bears because this is not this is not like
[8695.48s -> 8705.58s]  general gummy bears this is just what i thought about haribo oh god i'm being invaded are you
[8705.58s -> 8720.26s]  here to critique my choices again what's what's hold on what's wrong with these all right wait
[8720.34s -> 8725.86s]  let me ask you this would you put okay haribo gummy bears out of the bag right
[8726.66s -> 8734.31s]  like out of the bag what better or worse than like a local candy store gummy bear

[8810.02s -> 8814.26s]  just staring over your shoulder no no no no no what you did those races don't belong there
[8814.26s -> 8820.01s]  i'd you'd be like what are you talking about yes i do they know they belong here you're being like
[8820.01s -> 8825.82s]  you guys are critiquing me but this is like a real person here in the room going i can't imagine
[8825.82s -> 8833.08s]  there were like four thousand fucking people standing behind me i would be like in real time
[8833.08s -> 8837.56s]  it'd be like whoppers go down here and somebody you'd hear somebody like 400 feet behind being
[8837.56s -> 8842.66s]  like you're a fucking idiot don't be looking so i'm i'm sorry it's a it's a c tier i think
[8845.35s -> 8851.88s]  kim is your conscience let auto make the next decision auto what do you think
[8852.44s -> 8868.14s]  he loves everything has he eaten auto he's really dark in here hasn't he's a centrist candy man
[8868.86s -> 8876.46s]  no i i just look i don't like the soury stuff i don't oh yeah this is when i got really mad
[8877.42s -> 8883.98s]  what these no no no when you put the sour ropes on the bottom i don't i didn't i didn't remember
[8883.98s -> 8897.69s]  what they were i they're like these s tier all right cut the mic just kidding i'm just miming
[8898.25s -> 8912.78s]  do you think sour patch goes uh id or do you think it i think no i think it goes up to i think i
[8912.78s -> 8927.29s]  think you put jolly rancher down at uh somewhere around she's like what the fuck are you doing
[8985.67s -> 8991.24s]  never mind it's not gonna work i was thinking i was thinking of trying to get like auto to sit in the
[8991.24s -> 8998.97s]  chair like be sitting here and like he picks one because he wanted to but it didn't work out that
[8998.97s -> 9020.89s]  way like oh it's auto he's i'm not gonna do that more like get what do you what i don't know i
[9022.02s -> 9031.93s]  i got it i got it i got it maybe it would be funny like to have a scenario where like
[9032.57s -> 9049.06s]  i just leave stop stop stop stop saying that stop that this is a this is a this is a a pg 13
[9049.06s -> 9055.90s]  slightly towards our stream that's not we don't do talk about that on here whatever my she's like
[9055.90s -> 9060.22s]  brushing my hair well like just imagine my scenario you know what i mean i'm just like
[9060.22s -> 9065.26s]  doing a tier list about fucking candy and like my girlfriend's brushing my hair and i'm just like
[9066.22s -> 9089.50s]  what's happening i'm very easily distracted okay where were we oh yeah okay i'm they're gonna get
[9089.50s -> 9099.91s]  back on track here ring but where's ring pops there's a rossum where where are they somebody
[9099.91s -> 9116.09s]  said ring pops are trash no they're not what's wrong with the ring pop i think i would rather
[9116.09s -> 9121.37s]  have a ring pop than like a cadbury egg in fact yeah i don't know why they're up here this high
[9122.01s -> 9127.82s]  there's no right way to eat a cadbury egg and i'm not talking about like the racy campaign where
[9127.82s -> 9133.50s]  there's no wrong way to eat a rices there's no way to eat a cadbury egg if you bite into a
[9133.50s -> 9138.70s]  cadbury egg it's it like goes all over your mouth and all over your pants and shit if you put the
[9138.70s -> 9142.94s]  whole thing in your mouth at once it chokes you because it's too much you can't there's no way
[9142.94s -> 9154.97s]  to eat a cadbury egg that should be their campaign just swallow it whole just like that would hurt so
[9154.97s -> 9165.67s]  bad uh yeah i would put them underneath here all right probably below butterfinger too i don't think
[9165.67s -> 9172.09s]  i've ever i've never i don't think i've had these aren't these the same things as uh whoppers fun
[9172.09s -> 9182.28s]  facts our patch kids are s plus no they start to they start to hurt they start i determine if i
[9182.28s -> 9188.84s]  like a candy or not based on how many i can eat in a row before it makes me sick that sounds
[9188.84s -> 9196.97s]  fucked up it does but um i mean like how many can i eat in a row before i like start to not i hate
[9196.97s -> 9205.05s]  them and while a sour patch kid or a swedish fish may taste very very good after eight of them
[9205.77s -> 9215.10s]  you start to feel like shit i could eat like a two or three bars of twix if i eat like eight
[9215.10s -> 9221.90s]  to ten swedish fish they start to turn and cement themselves into one giant swedish fish ball
[9221.90s -> 9227.90s]  that sits down here like in your like down at the bottom of your esophagus it just it turns
[9227.90s -> 9235.66s]  into like a ball like bubble tape i don't know why people like this so much or even like this
[9235.66s -> 9241.18s]  is like a little bit different but bubble tape when you eat the whole roll you feel like terrible
[9241.18s -> 9245.58s]  afterwards it's like that chewy candy when you and you're supposed to like chew it and swallow
[9245.58s -> 9249.50s]  they got like a like a fruit by the foot when you eat that whole thing it's stuck if you feel
[9249.58s -> 9255.80s]  horrible i think there was one time i ate a whole thing of bubble tape and i was watching a movie
[9255.80s -> 9274.47s]  and i like almost shit my pants that's like eating a whole pack of gum it is a whole that's like five
[9274.47s -> 9287.24s]  packs of gum what was the movie toy story one all right everlasting gobstopper i'm not sure i've ever
[9287.24s -> 9294.94s]  had these really to be honest no i have they're like in that same category of like this kind of
[9295.02s -> 9302.39s]  shit it's like a jawbreaker this is just like a milk chocolate bar but they're oh they're good
[9302.39s -> 9312.28s]  i've had them before better than the eggs um oh this is the youtube surprise eggs i'm putting
[9312.28s -> 9316.76s]  them down here because i just don't i'm sick of seeing those in my recommended feed so no i don't
[9316.76s -> 9327.19s]  want to see them anymore 100 grand they're all it's like they're all right i don't really know
[9327.19s -> 9336.79s]  what these are laffy taffy not as good as real taffy is another one of those youtube surprise
[9336.79s -> 9345.96s]  eggs i don't want it who thought it was a good no honest to god who thought it was a good idea
[9347.03s -> 9357.35s]  to put little swallowable toys in food why would you do that is it like what do you like eat around
[9357.35s -> 9367.21s]  it do you break it in half or like what they aren't even in the food they're not i thought
[9367.21s -> 9375.82s]  it was like you isn't it like inside of the the food there is the little toy only americans
[9375.82s -> 9389.05s]  are dumb enough to eat those i what about like kids what about like little kids how would they
[9389.05s -> 9397.16s]  know see like do you are you supposed to just break it in half take the thing out and like
[9397.16s -> 9401.96s]  then eat the chocolate i would just put it in my mouth and like that would be like the coolest
[9401.96s -> 9406.28s]  surprise is like put the whole thing in your mouth without opening it and then like let the chocolate
[9406.28s -> 9409.32s]  melt around you while you move it around and try to figure out what it is before you take it out
[9409.32s -> 9418.12s]  of your mouth isn't that how you do it it's like oh i wonder what this is let me see uh it's a bike
[9418.12s -> 9428.15s]  right then you take it out and see if it's a bike they're inside of a container it's in a plastic
[9428.15s -> 9443.91s]  capsule i've never had one moving on i don't know what these are um are these the the chewy um
[9443.91s -> 9456.97s]  version of the jolly rancher what are those they've flavored tootsie rolls oh they're the fruit
[9456.97s -> 9464.38s]  tootsie rolls i've had these before i don't know where they stand are these um are these now and
[9464.38s -> 9471.66s]  later's uh i would put now and later's up here if every time i ate them i was not in fear of
[9471.66s -> 9481.91s]  ripping all of my teeth out of my jaw i've had scary moments before when i put a now and later
[9481.91s -> 9489.19s]  in my mouth and gone down a little too hard and it it's stuck here and i'm not going to get it
[9489.19s -> 9495.35s]  off without actually hurting myself sometimes if you do those situations where you bite down a
[9495.35s -> 9499.75s]  little too hard on now and later and you go well this is it i'm uh this is my i'm stuck here forever
[9499.75s -> 9506.60s]  now this is my life and you have to sit there like what do i do and then you do you like a
[9506.60s -> 9512.36s]  construction worker you like start to like get leverage around a molar and sit there and hold
[9512.36s -> 9538.39s]  and slow it too many bad memories it tastes good though please check hair we're good ow i can't
[9538.39s -> 9562.12s]  even comb it fleas you want to check me for fleas is he balding no i don't know what these are
[9562.68s -> 9570.14s]  oh they're runs although confirmed to me that those are runs those only exist in a globe at a
[9570.14s -> 9588.78s]  mall but they're fucking awesome those cost 50 cents banana runs are s tier yes they are yes
[9588.78s -> 9594.39s]  they are thank you for reminding me uh this we already have one of these up here so i'm going
[9594.39s -> 9600.63s]  to put this is three musketeers the rest of these these are i don't know i don't know i don't think
[9600.63s -> 9609.05s]  i've ever had this before doesn't belong in the trash but i never had it an arrow arrow have i ever
[9609.05s -> 9624.55s]  had these before arrow what are these i don't think wait are these hold on are these the ones
[9624.55s -> 9633.93s]  that are really soft and fluffy they you bite into them they're very fluffy and very like
[9633.93s -> 9648.31s]  puffy and chewy this is good this is really good oh man am i remember okay and they look like a shoe
[9648.31s -> 9653.93s]  right they're like they're like weirdly shaped they almost look like um like circus peanuts
[9653.93s -> 9666.63s]  do they have to okay do they have the consistency of a circus peanut do that they do they do do they
[9666.63s -> 9672.31s]  have the consistency of a circus peanut and no no no no guys guys guys guys not not a peanut that
[9672.31s -> 9679.35s]  you get at the circus this the orange circus peanut candy that exact that texture that like
[9680.15s -> 9692.73s]  chewy but fluffy circus peanut soft texture no people are getting really confused there is a
[9692.73s -> 9697.45s]  candy that is as old as time they were eating it in like the bible it's just called the circus
[9697.45s -> 9709.08s]  peanut they're bright orange soft chewy candy we know no but some people were telling me i that
[9709.08s -> 9715.50s]  they don't know okay so i'm wrong so i've done that maybe i never had them before i don't know
[9715.50s -> 9736.60s]  where they go i there has to be another tier these are bubble gums air bubble chocolate
[9736.60s -> 9742.30s]  i don't think i've ever had them but i feel like i have this is this is a another country right
[9744.26s -> 9749.62s]  all right settle down i'm ready to make my final decisions here this is three musketeers by the
[9749.62s -> 9768.87s]  way it belongs up there Reese's now if this was a Reese's egg it would go up here it's not if this
[9768.87s -> 9782.71s]  is the Reese's eggs the best it's not a Reese's egg i'm gonna have this go base Reese uh spree
[9783.43s -> 9787.99s]  definitely belongs up here as well three musketeers up there double bubble belongs maybe
[9787.99s -> 9795.11s]  up here dum dums they're gonna replace double bubble every moment i look at double bubble i'm
[9795.11s -> 9804.89s]  remembering the the dust that's around on it when you take a double bubble out it's covered in like
[9804.89s -> 9816.18s]  this weird dust like this white powder is all over it drop that's gonna have to drop it a few
[9816.18s -> 9826.87s]  points i'd rather have a twix i'd rather have a dumb dumb than a runt i'd rather have a twix
[9826.87s -> 9834.18s]  than a Reese's pc starburst have kind of fallen off for me uh recently so i'd i'd rather kitkats
[9834.18s -> 9841.59s]  probably up here in front everybody loves kitkats come on they like the best in fact i think that's
[9841.59s -> 9849.24s]  fair i'd rather have a kitkat than a spree i'd rather have a spree than a dumb dumb rather than
[9849.24s -> 9857.30s]  have a dumb dumb than a run okay twix yeah nestle crunch you get sick of this after a little while
[9857.30s -> 9863.02s]  though i could i could probably eat half of this bar and it would be a b-tier the other half of
[9863.02s -> 9874.42s]  that bar is probably somewhere down here okay i'd rather have starburst than nerds that dust is
[9874.42s -> 9894.42s]  fucking with me right now okay snickers no i don't not a big fan sweethearts are really good
[9895.22s -> 9902.26s]  mr goodbar is pretty good skittles are probably better than sweethearts no they're not what a lie
[9903.06s -> 9916.58s]  pocky is here twice um i can't get rid of it so just pretend that's up here fun dip and pez
[9916.58s -> 9925.56s]  ring pops are way better than fun dip milky way is better than fun dip and pez jolly rancher is
[9926.12s -> 9935.93s]  above that but well i just i don't chew gum anymore not really sweethearts are better than
[9935.93s -> 9960.92s]  dust gum are they are they though but okay when you unwrap a double bubble if you never had it
[9960.92s -> 9963.56s]  before just close your eyes and imagine this and those of you that haven't had it before
[9963.56s -> 9966.04s]  close your eyes and also imagine this because we're going to take this journey together
[9967.45s -> 9973.21s]  that when you put it you unwrap it's covered in like the gum cheeto dust you put it in your mouth
[9973.85s -> 9983.70s]  and that first two bites is like the first two bites of a double bubble i think trumps
[9984.68s -> 9999.64s]  everything down here did you experience it with me yeah like the first minute or two a double
[9999.64s -> 10005.53s]  but it's like um what's what's that zebra gum with all like the food dye and coloring and flavors in
[10005.53s -> 10015.38s]  it that you chew it for five seconds stripes yeah i would put stripes up here stripes would be above
[10015.70s -> 10024.36s]  would be up here because that there is a flavor that stripes gum has a flavor that has never been
[10024.36s -> 10034.07s]  replicated before it has this taste that you will never have again it doesn't taste like something
[10034.07s -> 10043.21s]  it doesn't remind you of something it just is what it is and it's it can't be fucking replicated
[10044.94s -> 10056.04s]  stripes gum was awesome skittles kind of have that same weird textural flavor to them
[10056.76s -> 10062.26s]  we're slim gyms this is candy man slim gyms they're bad feeling like on snacks
[10066.25s -> 10079.85s]  okay i'm getting uh sidetracked here those are gross uh ring pop and jolly rancher are like the
[10079.85s -> 10086.06s]  same thing for me but i would rather have a ring pop than a jolly rancher i'd rather have a jolly
[10086.06s -> 10090.79s]  rancher than a lifesaver i'd probably rather have a milky way than a good bar
[10092.18s -> 10100.17s]  or a tootsie pop no that's not true to default i would rather have a milky way than a snickers
[10100.17s -> 10126.94s]  though no i i don't think so i think i'd rather choose these than pocky sweets hearts belong up
[10126.94s -> 10135.54s]  here but does pez would i rather have a butterfinger or pez you got two people both on opposite
[10135.54s -> 10144.36s]  sides of the room hey dude do you want some pez yeah hey dude i got it you want some of my
[10144.36s -> 10162.66s]  butterfinger which one do i want pez because i would like to use a dispenser it would be pez
[10167.82s -> 10175.29s]  all right that's good for me i think i'd rather have this milk chocolate bar than a pocky that's
[10175.29s -> 10182.30s]  what they say pocky isn't good pocky is good yeah good then i could just yeah yeah you get it you
[10182.30s -> 10188.09s]  get a pez for the toy then i could just run off with the toy you know oh hey thanks with pez and
[10188.09s -> 10192.41s]  i like ripped a fucking head off and then start sprinting and then like give them you know that'd
[10192.41s -> 10203.06s]  be easy but pez tastes bad i actually don't i don't mind the taste of pez okay hair just fell
[10203.06s -> 10217.94s]  out no i don't hate pez i think i think that tastes good pez is another one of those things
[10217.94s -> 10225.19s]  it has that flavor that cannot be replicated all right this is important i would rather have
[10225.19s -> 10233.78s]  these gummy bears than sour patch kids i would probably rather have a warhead
[10236.25s -> 10247.48s]  i would eat the gummy bears over a butterfinger because it's really easy to be like oh i'll have
[10247.48s -> 10254.25s]  a few gummy bears you can't have a few butterfingers when you open it that's it and
[10254.25s -> 10262.02s]  they're huge butterfingers are too big i think i found the problem i i found the problem butterfingers
[10262.02s -> 10269.35s]  are this big it's like holding a hammer if butterfingers were smaller by default you can
[10269.35s -> 10276.84s]  get mini butterfingers but they're thick even the small mini butterfingers are really thick
[10277.72s -> 10283.32s]  if they were a little thinner do they make thin butterfingers that's not as much of like the
[10283.32s -> 10326.76s]  shaved ice that makes up the internal organ why is he in a cave what was i saying crispy
[10326.76s -> 10336.28s]  butterfingers are great yeah but do they are they thin i would eat butterfingers if they were thin
[10344.17s -> 10355.05s]  add an echo to your voice oh my fucking god hold on guys let me eat i'm gonna eat my jolly rancher
[10355.61s -> 10374.92s]  all right what am i doing oh an echo i can't i don't think i can even do that
[10378.50s -> 10398.55s]  i don't think i can add an echo to this hold on can i wait wait wait i think i can hold on let me
[10398.55s -> 10405.75s]  add let me add an audio input it's gonna be the webcam and i'm gonna delay it by like a half a
[10405.75s -> 10426.23s]  quarter of a second okay can you hear me can you guys hear me is it happening at the same time
[10426.79s -> 10445.22s]  all right here we go so i'm gonna delay this by like hello hello hello hello hello
[10447.38s -> 10469.70s]  hello no hold on this just became way more important hello hello hello hello
[10470.66s -> 10510.44s]  a little more more more how's that hello hello louder louder do it louder now i'm standing on a
[10510.44s -> 10518.47s]  cliff how what's that how long wait a minute hold on a second i'm gonna try to scare the shit out
[10518.47s -> 10548.42s]  of myself hold on let me see if this is possible does this do anything hey did it work i'm gonna
[10548.42s -> 10569.64s]  try to jump scare myself i'm gonna monitor this hold on okay this is gonna come through
[10570.36s -> 10589.43s]  all right you ready okay so what i want to do here is rices uh where do i want to put rices
[10590.07s -> 10628.38s]  how about put it up an s tier did it happen i don't think it happened wait hold on what is
[10628.38s -> 10660.10s]  10 000 milliseconds did it happen tell me if you hear it it's quiet when it happens is it hold on
[10660.66s -> 10668.18s]  this just became something that is way more important all right 50 000 milliseconds
[10669.56s -> 10682.42s]  i can't i can only do like 10 000 i think i can do i can do 50 okay 30 000 milliseconds no
[10682.42s -> 10693.34s]  i can do 29 000 no i can do 20 000 milliseconds that's as much as i can do all right here we go
[10693.98s -> 10698.78s]  that's the highest i can go is 20 000 let me i'm gonna i'm gonna scare the shit out of you guys
[10698.78s -> 10703.74s]  you ready what if i mute here and then it just happens at some point that'll work right
[10716.66s -> 10727.42s]  okay so i'm thinking haribo should probably go up a tier what do you think something like
[10728.30s -> 10750.97s]  five uh percentage points up it didn't work it should happen again wait did it do it twice
[10758.14s -> 10802.82s]  it happened twice oh wait wait wait wait wait okay so i think that if nestle crunch is somewhere
[10802.82s -> 10810.34s]  over twits that would mean that sweet tart can have to then theoretically be around there too
[10810.34s -> 10815.62s]  because they're both delicious they're both really good they both taste very well and i think that
[10815.62s -> 10849.38s]  they would be in a good did it did it did i did it work uh one more i think my favorite movie was
[10849.38s -> 10855.37s]  probably um i'm a big fan of toy story 3 was really good somebody asked in the chat i just
[10855.37s -> 10864.86s]  want to make sure that i got i answered it yeah story story three story four was okay too i
[10864.86s -> 10870.92s]  didn't i didn't i i liked it i think dots should probably go i don't know much what do you guys
[10870.92s -> 10914.02s]  think not f i don't think it belongs in f i think my favorite movie was probably um i'm a big fan
[10914.02s -> 10917.46s]  of toy story 3 was really good somebody asked in the chat i just want to make sure that i got i
[10917.46s -> 10944.50s]  answered it yeah story story story 4 was okay too i didn't that sounds so fucked up like what the
[10944.50s -> 10964.22s]  hell is going on over here what the fuck are we doing oh yeah i gotta turn this off i have
[10964.22s -> 10978.60s]  this it's okay it's no longer being captured get a soundboard to do this again all right i hold on i
[10978.60s -> 10983.72s]  do one do one more but this time i'm gonna like break this microphone because it sounds so strange
[10983.72s -> 10996.10s]  hold on just give me a second last one and then we'll move on by the way i don't know how loud
[10996.10s -> 11042.39s]  this is going to be so just prepare yourself prepare yourself
[11054.95s -> 11065.13s]  tends to be a little overpowering for me i like it when it's a little uh milder it tastes
[11066.09s -> 11077.94s]  good but no i don't think it's enough for um to have on a daily basis for your candy preferences
[11098.63s -> 11105.13s]  i live in the middle of this somebody asked why did you do pocky twice i want to hear it let me
[11105.13s -> 11116.12s]  see was that one any better that's like in that's my mind that's my mind that's about somebody
[11116.12s -> 11123.94s]  wrote that that's my mind talking record yourself from outside of the room no i want to i want to
[11123.94s -> 11141.77s]  see that one and then i'm moving on swedish fish
[11155.37s -> 11158.95s]  tends to be a little overpowering for me
[11165.56s -> 11175.50s]  why why does it sound like that there's no reason for it to sound like that
[11179.11s -> 11191.96s]  okay i'm done with that i'm going to continue now i'm going to remove this from my obs and
[11193.62s -> 11203.80s]  we're going to continue with what we were fucking doing um okay where i was over here
[11211.08s -> 11224.74s]  he's coming down oh my god i would rather have a lemon head than all this stuff probably not
[11224.74s -> 11235.51s]  gummy bears though you promised up you promised us a mambo number five lip sync i'm a liar i've
[11235.51s -> 11250.09s]  lied to you i'm not doing that shit i'd rather have 100 grand than uh what would you do with
[11250.09s -> 11257.37s]  100 grand oh i would buy a bunch of stuff and i would uh put it into a 401k what would you do
[11257.37s -> 11269.56s]  with 100 grand i need it for those that gets fucking knocked down like five points don't
[11269.56s -> 11291.78s]  minus two me that's not my joke that's their joke as you wish all right i'm done i think that's
[11291.78s -> 11301.90s]  pretty accurate for me remember this is a this is a three musketeers that's not a mr good bar
[11301.90s -> 11314.18s]  what a terrible list reese's kitkats sprees dum-dums is that really that bad of a list
[11318.28s -> 11322.28s]  reese's kitkats sprees dum-dums like that's those are very very very high quality
[11325.32s -> 11330.60s]  how is pocky trash no no pocky's not trash there's two pockies i can't get rid of this one
[11331.54s -> 11337.86s]  this is pocky's up here at sea why are m&m's and f because there are more ants
[11337.86s -> 11342.50s]  though they were what they were whatever the fuck i said there are more m&m's than ants
[11342.50s -> 11351.43s]  and people on earth that's why i said it crispy m&m's would be up here peanut m&m's peanut butter
[11351.43s -> 11366.06s]  m&m's would be up here uh my favorite german 985 chat memes i'm gonna do this one okay german 985
[11366.06s -> 11378.54s]  chat memes take a screenshot here because we're changing all right let's go with here we go here

[11719.58s -> 11726.84s]  this stuff up here will has probably test of time type shit on it mom's making cookies won't last
[11726.84s -> 11751.19s]  because it's limited edition oh short will last you forever whatever you say uh photoshop those
[11751.19s -> 11761.78s]  are always fun late uh i i just i'm i'm not i just that's i'm just late sometimes i don't know well

[11769.13s -> 11782.84s]  pretty good doing the tuber voice now i like that one a lot thanos is just it's just thanos
[11786.76s -> 11796.94s]  germacon or jexpo that's not even a meme that this is like why is it just like a raft here
[11796.94s -> 11810.47s]  what's with the raft uh this is kind of over it's a spill joke i mean i just it's not a joke i just
[11810.47s -> 11817.50s]  i spill stuff i get angry at games sometimes not all the time though eating ass enough of that
[11818.97s -> 11830.33s]  free shit i uh the boomer stuff is down here too i mean i love the okay the boomer emote up here
[11830.97s -> 11844.68s]  though like everything you like is because you're old down there he's had enough of ass easy uh
[11844.68s -> 11851.45s]  constant conflict is uh just that's just the way it is uh jex is always at s tier no matter what
[11851.45s -> 11859.08s]  you just i he has to be number one jex cannot appear on a list unless he is at the first spot
[11859.08s -> 11864.73s]  i just there's no i can't do anything about that kim check is kind of funny still i guess
[11865.85s -> 11871.58s]  rats are just you know rats are classic up in smoke ah it's kind of overstated i think a little
[11871.58s -> 11875.58s]  bit i wouldn't call it like complete complete total theory but it's like it's it's on its way up
[11877.21s -> 11883.85s]  pre-recorded i don't it's like on its way up caught his mic is like currently fun right now
[11883.85s -> 11894.68s]  because people like say that so it's it's pretty high uh he's fucking naked uh look at me is still
[11894.68s -> 11899.83s]  it's still up there i think a little bit he's laughing about it i think that's like uh down
[11899.83s -> 11903.75s]  here a little bit worma is like probably all the way down here didn't really do much with worma
[11904.63s -> 11912.34s]  germa's liar yeah uh the seagulls can't really ever get rid of the seagulls but i don't know i
[11912.34s -> 11916.82s]  mean that's like probably a couple years ago it's not you know what i mean subsounds don't even
[11916.82s -> 11922.79s]  have these as subsounds anymore but they when they were active they were i would put them right
[11922.79s -> 11929.24s]  behind minus two plus two or it probably a little bit ahead of it what rapper and reddit what does
[11929.24s -> 11938.84s]  that mean i'm not sure what that means and then uh cheese it versus cheese nips up here is two
[11939.80s -> 11945.13s]  there you go germa lied about the clown car just gave five thank you germa lied about the
[11945.13s -> 11954.28s]  clown car thanks for the five community subs five community subs rolling in thank you remember
[11954.28s -> 11963.50s]  the house flipper oh right right right yeah that's probably up here let me think here
[11965.26s -> 11969.50s]  no fuck the labo the slap is way way like funnier just because how fucking embarrassing that is
[11971.16s -> 11978.17s]  hot air balloon is is up here too photoshop's are better than the labo
[11979.21s -> 11984.25s]  biaz funnier than uh no pee pants is thick but funny the youtube voice is definitely below
[11984.25s -> 11993.98s]  i'm a top 1000 streamers that goes above labo jupiter is probably in front of this dark souls
[11993.98s -> 11998.06s]  three beating dark souls three better than that constant conflict is better than this
[11998.78s -> 12007.61s]  um i lie so that just goes down here hey peter no that's like not even funny died to pinwheel is
[12007.61s -> 12023.85s]  like just a mean thing people did okay well i like this so far rats are better than this
[12024.41s -> 12037.77s]  i lifted weights on camera for like fucking 10 seconds who who cares um all right uh germa
[12037.77s -> 12043.13s]  craft i think is better free shit's better germa iq is better ban that guy's better grill master's
[12043.13s -> 12046.97s]  not as good as the kim check and pre-recorded is better than grill master and laughing about it is
[12046.97s -> 12054.04s]  grill master's probably better uh germa con this enough that's nonsense that's just a thing that
[12054.04s -> 12083.32s]  i think would be fun okay i think i got it no not yet done done this tier list is bad
[12085.22s -> 12092.25s]  is this a tier list of my own channel's memes it is well i didn't make these up i got i mean
[12092.33s -> 12099.22s]  some of them i did why is peter on c and bald coin on f well it's just been a while
[12103.34s -> 12117.69s]  who made the best controllers controllers i could do that one yeah give me give me the
[12117.69s -> 12124.36s]  video game controllers i'll do it but i drank too much i gotta pee again tell me if the internet's
[12124.36s -> 12128.44s]  fine i'll be right back i gotta pee this is like the third time in i've been peeing too much
[12129.67s -> 12132.39s]  i'm gonna like ask my doctor how many times a human is supposed to pee a day
[12133.34s -> 12136.38s]  i've had my kidneys checked and my bladder checked what's wrong with me i'll be right back
[12261.51s -> 12272.41s]  it is dark in here it really is a cave in here let me turn like the let's see the volume up
[12282.54s -> 12292.42s]  watch the slap i don't need to watch the slap you know how many times i've watched the slap
[12293.67s -> 12307.00s]  it dozens and dozens and dozens of times let's come back i'm gonna change the camera settings
[12317.88s -> 12343.30s]  okey dokey look at that better more controlled do i still have the comb in my hair no all right
[12343.30s -> 12359.29s]  uh let's get this off these are controllers so d i would just put do a beer tier list i don't drink
[12359.29s -> 12379.42s]  that much beer to have like a real opinion on it hold on come on get over there stop it all right
[12379.42s -> 12388.97s]  that's good uh so these these are video game controllers this is dirty whatever okay video
[12388.97s -> 12403.94s]  game controllers uh let's change this to let's put one let's put f down here new f change the
[12403.94s -> 12416.18s]  color too okay fuck that thing seriously that like one of us that was horrible i this thing was so
[12416.18s -> 12433.96s]  bad it was so bad sideways switch no you can't even hold it although what the hell what is this
[12433.96s -> 12444.47s]  chainsaw that's that's that's a collector's edition perk for buying a collector's edition
[12444.47s -> 12468.20s]  that's not a what is that no this hurts if you hold it too long super nintendo controller pretty
[12468.20s -> 12483.30s]  close to being perfect so is the n64 controller game cubes up there too i'll make a final decision
[12483.30s -> 12495.26s]  in a minute the default regular super nintendo control is at least a b this thing wasn't very
[12495.26s -> 12514.23s]  good either this was this but get in the way with a wheel really the wee wheel is here that's why
[12515.50s -> 12523.91s]  why are there spongebob controllers i wouldn't use these i mean well i'm not going to buy that
[12523.91s -> 12537.13s]  i wouldn't use it there's no i i wouldn't i wouldn't buy it can i just have another category
[12537.13s -> 12544.34s]  that's just like this is just clearly joke like nonsense category they're not bad but they're
[12544.34s -> 12556.55s]  just like why i don't want them i don't want them yeah there's a new category below this is just
[12556.55s -> 12563.14s]  going to be just like the nonsense category at this i mean that these are not bad controllers
[12563.14s -> 12577.42s]  that just they're nonsense this is just a controller skin what is that is it n64
[12578.22s -> 12590.49s]  but is it is that a left-handed n64 controller well i don't understand is that like for
[12591.21s -> 12607.66s]  i don't i've never used it it looks a little crowded i would accidentally press like up on
[12607.66s -> 12614.55s]  the d-pad when i pressed air b i'm not sure i like that i never used it but i don't don't look
[12614.55s -> 12623.56s]  fun to me the dreamcast controller actually is pretty good it's pretty well made it had the big
[12623.56s -> 12634.46s]  slots the big divots in the back to really hold on to that you can just slide into this is a
[12634.46s -> 12640.76s]  comedy controller i don't think that this is also a comedy controller this is the dance dance
[12640.76s -> 12646.76s]  revolution pad before dance dance revolution so it's going to get f just because it was pretty
[12648.76s -> 12658.23s]  it was pretty new for its time the wiimote and nunchuck i would put them up here they were
[12658.79s -> 12682.94s]  kind of fun and nice to use this is like a fishing pole what is that i i did what what is this for
[12685.32s -> 12708.02s]  this wu tang wait was there a wu tang console was there it's a collector's edition yeah but
[12708.02s -> 12716.60s]  that's what i mean it's not like a controller comes with a console the wiifit scale i'll put
[12716.60s -> 12726.22s]  it up here where it belongs and like oh it's right next to this is fun the steam control is
[12726.22s -> 12736.42s]  really not good this is the same as this just with different colored buttons so i mean i'm
[12736.42s -> 12755.59s]  gonna put that in nonsense this is just like the skittles version that's not this is just like a
[12755.59s -> 12763.13s]  peripheral it's not even a controller is this a keyboard like hold on like just a keyboard and
[12763.21s -> 12798.94s]  mouse for pc gaming i thought that's not that's not fair is it hold on what is this is it a mat
[12799.58s -> 12806.06s]  this looks like a beach towel is this another one of these like dance dance revolution maps or
[12806.06s -> 12823.24s]  something okay well that uh no the wiimote wiimote sideways was better than the switch sideways for
[12823.24s -> 12834.60s]  me it's bigger here's the dreamcast keyboard which this is just a nonsense collector's edition
[12834.60s -> 12843.48s]  controller i actually don't really like the ds's analog it was too thin for me it felt like it
[12843.48s -> 12852.60s]  could easily be worn down well this is a fishing pole like i said okay i can go over the that
[12852.60s -> 12864.60s]  fishing pole what if it is the best controller this is the pro controller right this thing's
[12864.60s -> 12871.77s]  actually that's actually pretty good it's better than this one it's probably the game cube no it's
[12871.77s -> 12882.38s]  not which one of these was better it was this one's better yeah i wasn't actually a big fan of this
[12882.38s -> 12890.66s]  one this one actually feels better in your hands but this one actually bumps if you're trying to
[12890.66s -> 12901.34s]  you might bump it i remember you know it's it's pretty good um this is just a joke this is just
[12901.34s -> 12912.63s]  a skin so right this this looks like a piano is this a keyboard or is this a controller i don't
[12912.63s -> 12932.86s]  know what this is for what is this is this a gear shift on a car no this is no it's not all right
[12932.86s -> 12942.73s]  this is like revolutionary so that goes up here those are atari paddles this is just a skin
[12943.86s -> 12951.78s]  all right now we're getting to kind of current gen i really really really like the new dual shock
[12951.78s -> 12961.86s]  controller way more than i like the original i like how uh spread out it is i think this is actually
[12961.86s -> 12968.84s]  way up here original xbox was a little too fat and chunky for me but it was definitely better
[12968.84s -> 12976.63s]  than this i actually i don't hate the xbox one controller but i do hate its annoyingly loud
[12976.63s -> 13001.27s]  bumpers the 360 controller might be up here i think so what else we got these are not very good
[13003.18s -> 13012.73s]  the old sega genesis and sega they're very clunky three buttons it was just i didn't i don't really
[13012.73s -> 13018.06s]  like the playstation one controller either but it's definitely better than the dreamcast keyboard
[13026.81s -> 13036.01s]  in fact the ds controller is way better than the dreamcast keyboard this is not yeah i mean this
[13036.01s -> 13054.76s]  thing is like what is this what the fuck even is this it's a boomerang controller i don't what is
[13054.76s -> 13061.14s]  that but that's your that's a sega uh the sega master system it really wasn't that good of a
[13061.14s -> 13069.86s]  controller though better than this it was really weird the whole thing was one button that's a
[13069.94s -> 13079.75s]  stovetop yeah you take this thing camping that's a stovetop that's pretty good that's really good
[13080.76s -> 13094.36s]  mod that guy this is just a joke this is a joke this is a cassette tape it's not even a controller
[13096.14s -> 13108.76s]  playstation camera i'll put them up here we'll deal with them later uh this this is the deal or
[13108.76s -> 13115.83s]  no deal pad i don't know what this is for this is yes or no button i don't think i think i would
[13115.83s -> 13129.93s]  use that it's just a peripheral this goes up here this this is just the evolved version of this
[13129.93s -> 13137.51s]  controller pokemon so i'm just gonna let's just put this up here i don't really like this one
[13137.51s -> 13156.50s]  though um fight sticks i don't really like fight sticks and then this is those are too many buttons
[13160.07s -> 13166.87s]  i don't know what you would do with that all right um so hold on the guitar hero is just it's a
[13166.87s -> 13173.51s]  peripheral it's not even a controller all right i gotta make a decision here what belongs where
[13173.51s -> 13227.45s]  what belongs up and what belongs down i know don't look at my zip it's done i do that that's the most
[13227.45s -> 13234.73s]  comfortable controller i think it is it has a nice weight to it the analogs feel very durable
[13236.18s -> 13243.74s]  the button placements the triggers are in a really good place i think it is the best controller
[13243.74s -> 13261.70s]  it's got really nice triggers it's got the lr l l1 and r1 i like it a lot the game cube is
[13261.70s -> 13277.96s]  really close if this is s this is like s minus but a plus i mean i don't have to move anything
[13277.96s -> 13285.38s]  i'm happy with this where's the xbox one controller that doesn't belong all the way down there
[13296.28s -> 13303.46s]  this does though i don't i they put the this is the wii u pro controller right they put the
[13303.46s -> 13309.46s]  right analog stick in a really fucking weird place up above on the top right shoulder
[13310.26s -> 13324.97s]  it almost it feels odd this is the connect this is not the playstation move
[13333.69s -> 13346.65s]  this is the playstation move okay what about just dance i don't i don't play just dance
[13347.37s -> 13367.53s]  okay hold on this is better than this i don't even remember which one of these i liked more
[13367.61s -> 13387.85s]  probably the uh do i like charizard more than i like charmeleon yeah i think so playstation
[13387.85s -> 13395.43s]  one i don't like better than the playstation like three though xbox one is xbox one's definitely
[13395.43s -> 13405.22s]  better than the playstation one just because of the introduction of analogs i don't like the
[13406.28s -> 13417.06s]  fruit slice this is superior to me are these the same thing one of them is just wireless
[13421.50s -> 13427.94s]  wait is this just the wireless version of this it is isn't it this dualshock 2 dualshock 3
[13428.66s -> 13435.99s]  these are like the same wait which one of these is which one of these is which
[13437.32s -> 13452.38s]  it's ps3 and ps2 right okay they look the same okay dualshock 2 has the wire okay yeah
[13452.94s -> 13470.31s]  it belongs there i'm all right with this the rest of this shit is just jokey weird stuff that i've
[13470.31s -> 13481.32s]  never used so hold on let me go back up here i really like the it's very minimal the dreamcast
[13481.32s -> 13488.79s]  controller is super minimal gets the job done it's got nice triggers it fits in your hand well
[13488.79s -> 13492.47s]  it's got that cool screen you got you guys didn't get to see that when we did all the dreamcast
[13492.47s -> 13499.50s]  stuff there's a little screen that is your memory card that had all the cool random little it would
[13499.50s -> 13503.18s]  play little animations you could use it you could select things you could have in-game features it
[13503.18s -> 13511.96s]  was pretty cool the vmu doesn't have a right analog didn't need it though this is back when
[13511.96s -> 13521.38s]  two analogs weren't really necessary i mean that's not minimal it's an analog four face buttons and
[13521.38s -> 13531.08s]  a d-pad there's no other analog and it's spread out it has the same amount of buttons as a super
[13531.08s -> 13535.77s]  super antenna controller now the screen is just like an added feature that's in the in the
[13535.77s -> 13544.31s]  controller it but the actual physical controller itself is very basic oh well fuck i forgot the
[13544.31s -> 13550.23s]  original xbox below it belongs way down here i forgot i just had a memory the weird sideways
[13550.23s -> 13556.20s]  tilted face buttons yeah no get out of here this thing sucked i completely forgot about that
[13557.59s -> 13563.83s]  the like like it was printed on incorrectly type of scenario no yeah that's below the wii u
[13564.63s -> 13574.34s]  i hated that those got printed incorrectly from like the machine and they had like 50 000 of them
[13574.34s -> 13581.38s]  already made and the the foreman on the at the factory was just like just do it like this just
[13581.38s -> 13588.84s]  do it it's a feature no yeah this that i hated those i don't think it's worse than the keyboard
[13588.84s -> 13596.58s]  like the dreamcast keyboard with a grill or the connect no the connect is cooler this this is no
[13596.58s -> 13606.98s]  get that out of here this is the i can't sit still all right the the steam controller is better than
[13606.98s -> 13613.91s]  like the camping grill okay it is i'll give that to you this is not a dreamcast keyboard what the
[13613.91s -> 13662.17s]  hell is this then is this a game cube keyboard have you even touched a steam controller where the
[13662.17s -> 13682.92s]  fuck is it yeah i own one i own one but i don't know where it is never mind i thought i had one
[13682.92s -> 13687.90s]  in the closet back there i bought here's how you can tell that i'm lying about this because i'm
[13687.90s -> 13691.66s]  gonna give you an elaborate story and it's the only reason why you'd hear this i'm not just making
[13691.66s -> 13695.82s]  it up on the fly you didn't have time to make this up i bought a steam controller because i
[13695.82s -> 13699.34s]  currently like maybe this is probably like three three and a half years ago i got back into world
[13699.34s -> 13706.86s]  of warcraft and during the uh legion whatever it was um what was it called yeah the lab the
[13706.86s -> 13712.06s]  expansion pack that people liked like two or three years ago so i wanted to not use my keyboard and
[13712.06s -> 13717.10s]  mouse to play world of warcraft i desperately wanted to lean back and lie on a couch and just
[13717.10s -> 13720.30s]  play world of warcraft from the computer so i was like hold on a minute wait i can do the steam
[13720.30s -> 13727.02s]  controller because i can map it everything can be mapped to this to it being like a pc keyboard
[13727.02s -> 13732.30s]  right so i tried to do it and i realized that trying to use the steam controller to play world
[13732.30s -> 13740.14s]  of warcraft was impossible and i could only really map like four buttons or like five buttons to
[13740.14s -> 13745.66s]  spells and abilities so i would it worked technically but i could really only do like three
[13745.66s -> 13753.22s]  moves so i had to just sit there and do the same like three or four move rotation and it worked
[13753.22s -> 13760.62s]  until i got to like level like 22 and then i just gave up because i got too many abilities
[13761.34s -> 13774.63s]  how is that a problem with the steam controller because the steam controller has the pads
[13775.35s -> 13780.86s]  the track the mouse pads to make it so you can actually utilize like a mouse or utilize like
[13780.86s -> 13787.18s]  turning around and move like you can't map that kind of shit to uh you can't have a mouse b on
[13787.18s -> 13795.46s]  like your xbox controller it's like the axis is too like finicky don't worry in bfa you only have
[13795.46s -> 13805.69s]  four abilities anyways i stopped playing after legion there's literally an add-on that solves
[13805.69s -> 13818.87s]  your problem now well back to world of warcraft i played what yeah i played like three years three
[13818.87s -> 13824.95s]  and a half years ago i streamed i streamed wow remember karazhan it's the worst remember one of
[13824.95s -> 13831.46s]  the top three worst streams i've ever done you guys don't remember that that was peak me trying
[13831.46s -> 13835.72s]  to get the steam controller to work why am i putting my headphones in there's no reason to
[13835.72s -> 13847.19s]  there's no sounds you can work your way up to an officer in my guild did you do the door handles
[13847.19s -> 13852.76s]  tier list why the fuck would i ever do a door handles tier list put it in the chat i'll do it
[13852.76s -> 13875.08s]  next uh all right i think i'm done i'm happy with this these are originals why is the fight stick
[13875.08s -> 13891.13s]  lower than the game cube keyboard what is this karazhan 7.1 burp uh i don't because i don't use
[13891.13s -> 13906.30s]  fight sticks i don't know am i desynced i shouldn't be all right let's do door handles
[13911.85s -> 13948.39s]  door handles tier list uh right this is fucking stupid i'm more of like a toilet flush handle
[13948.39s -> 13957.62s]  kind of guy i don't like i don't like the just regular just little doorknobs because if you
[13957.62s -> 13962.87s]  put moisturizer on your hands you can't open them you're stuck in the room if you have any like oil
[13962.87s -> 13974.55s]  or moisturizer or anything there's like a keypad i have to remember a code wait a minute this is a
[13974.55s -> 13984.06s]  code and a toilet flusher okay that's cool these ones fun fact about these doorknobs guys they're
[13984.06s -> 13988.54s]  not secure at all because on the other end is a hole that's right in the middle of that fucking
[13988.54s -> 13996.17s]  thing that somebody just has to stick a a little pin in there and can pop the lock and open the
[13996.17s -> 14011.34s]  door those are not secure you you can you can get into those what is this one i don't know it looks
[14011.34s -> 14016.18s]  it looks exactly the fucking same i'm not into this kind of stuff it's like too it's too like
[14016.18s -> 14022.26s]  elaborate for me just give me like the the toilet handle it's not even that's not even a door handle
[14022.26s -> 14035.53s]  that's a part of a train track crystal now this stuff breaks there's a shower head this is dumb
[14035.53s -> 14041.72s]  it's like that you know a little a little turn no no that's not no this is up at a because that's a
[14044.15s -> 14057.32s]  because you can't fuck that up you just you grab and you turn and push no this is like a that's
[14057.32s -> 14073.48s]  like a candy no again put these down here and put that down here all right i have a lot of season

[16365.45s -> 16374.94s]  localized games sonic team i haven't really made a good sonic game in a while nether realm is
[16376.52s -> 16386.30s]  uh the mortal combats have been pretty good recently i'll figure it out later there's the
[16386.30s -> 16396.22s]  tony hawke company but this is not this is not just this is not a fair list because some of
[16396.22s -> 16422.06s]  these companies don't exist anymore nc soft this is the um last guardian and shadow classes
[16422.70s -> 16433.70s]  it's up there somewhere that game was really sloppy but it was really really interesting
[16434.42s -> 16445.80s]  and plus shadow the classes is really great you can't deny that minecraft wasn't like a
[16445.80s -> 16451.08s]  huge success but i don't think it i personally don't i'm not going to put it in b
[16455.98s -> 16463.18s]  isn't take take two is now take two is like all the sports games and technically gta but
[16463.98s -> 16481.06s]  they publish they don't really make they don't really develop right naughty dog naughty dog's
[16481.06s -> 16492.86s]  doing pretty well like they actually like really well i have to i'm gonna i'll head back to this
[16501.94s -> 16506.02s]  the rest of these i kind of i don't really know what they were turtle rock they made
[16506.02s -> 16525.74s]  evolve right square enix so idos idos is technically what io now like no that's like
[16525.74s -> 16539.90s]  hitman but it's not was io interactive on here i don't see io interactive on here so should i
[16539.90s -> 16555.51s]  put i should i do idos as if it is hitman because idos technically was hitman but it wasn't but it
[16555.51s -> 16568.12s]  was i'm gonna pretend that this is a hitman company no that's not supposed to be there
[16574.30s -> 16579.82s]  nexon this is like the massive multiplayer company that they like half of the mmos you
[16579.82s -> 16595.70s]  see that pop up in like an ad on the side of your youtube page is by nexon monolith uh monolith did
[16595.70s -> 16605.58s]  the ones are the ones that were responsible for shadow of mordor if i'm gonna put wb up here then
[16605.58s -> 16622.50s]  monolith should be up here too higher than that too many video game companies dice not doing it
[16622.50s -> 16629.13s]  for me not doing it for me game freak now this is pokemon i'll tell you it has to go down here
[16629.13s -> 16635.26s]  because i don't really i don't have much experience with pokemon old acclaim here's the thing about
[16635.26s -> 16642.38s]  old acclaim all their games were dog shit but they all were charming in some kind of way their games
[16642.38s -> 16663.45s]  were terrible but they did a lot of interesting things that's gonna be indeed all i remember is
[16663.45s -> 16673.45s]  the old wwf acclaim games and they were so bad valve below ea i'm not just wait wait i'm not done
[16673.45s -> 16679.86s]  with the list i have to get everybody in the right spot and then from there we add on to it and i put
[16679.86s -> 16685.64s]  that look i'm just getting him the general idea this is just they're gonna change it's not like
[16685.64s -> 16695.94s]  wait rare is about blizzard just hold on just i got there's a lot to compress here what is this
[16696.50s -> 16715.11s]  fear axis what's your axis civilization x-com i don't have enough experience with it the rest
[16715.11s -> 16722.52s]  of these i really don't know obsidian is good but we'll see how their new game is who knows
[16724.58s -> 16729.94s]  coffee stain is that's like the goat simulator team right and they did some other what else have
[16729.94s -> 16752.90s]  they done what else have they done i don't know sanctum coffee stain um deep rock they published
[16752.90s -> 16771.96s]  deep rock but they didn't develop it does that count maybe i guess it does in a way okay where
[16771.96s -> 16779.08s]  is oh god this is gonna be fucking hell sorting through quantic dream i don't think i have enough
[16779.08s -> 16793.51s]  experience didn't they make one game it was like a movie game grasshopper is we'll see we'll see
[16793.51s -> 16797.67s]  when the new no more heroes comes up because they haven't really done anything good at all in the
[16797.75s -> 16812.06s]  last like at least probably four or five years it's tough oh they're the okay yeah yeah yeah
[16813.18s -> 16825.80s]  uh i like detroit become human i thought it was fun no more heroes is awesome but i haven't really
[16825.80s -> 16833.10s]  done anything in a long time that i really played that i thought was like interesting
[16835.98s -> 16843.50s]  how do i alienate every gamer except for the people that like from software sony capcom rock
[16843.50s -> 16850.23s]  star nintendo naughty dog interplay midway how laboratories rocksteady um stardew valley guy
[16850.23s -> 16867.61s]  lucas arts eiko eidos and bandai namco except for the all those people rockstar at a gta5 was
[16867.61s -> 16877.29s]  fucking awesome red dead redemption 2 was really fun no i i am one of these is going to gum bs
[16878.01s -> 16884.60s]  now you gotta wait let me do my first draft i'm still trying to juggle of
[16885.48s -> 16907.56s]  what what the hell e-ha games is i don't know what this is what is this one i don't know what
[16907.56s -> 16913.98s]  it is somebody can tell me all right the reason why capcom is up here is because the last like
[16913.98s -> 16919.30s]  four or five games that capcom has come up with have been awesome resident evil 2 was fucking
[16919.30s -> 16931.38s]  awesome monster hunter world was awesome um i heard devil may cry was awesome i mean they've
[16931.38s -> 16942.04s]  been knocking it out of the park recently this is you guys told me 2019 resident evil 2 was
[16942.04s -> 16949.94s]  fantastic it was really really really really fucking good do you think that capcom in the
[16949.94s -> 16967.06s]  last few years should be below like epic games unless you're like play fortnite no okay look
[16967.86s -> 16973.40s]  all the companies that are in b and c i have not gone over and thought about yet this is
[16973.72s -> 16981.06s]  this is gonna take a lot a long time let me just remember okay insomniac insomniac made the new
[16981.06s -> 16986.57s]  spider-man one right they're up here that new spider-man game was really really really fucking
[16986.57s -> 16994.07s]  good so up here i'll figure it out a minute yacht club games made shovel knight i haven't
[16994.07s -> 17004.06s]  didn't really played that much irrational games what the hell is that it's so familiar what is it
[17010.20s -> 17017.77s]  bioshock right okay right right right right right right right bioshock infinite was good
[17020.04s -> 17034.52s]  didn't they just didn't they liquid didn't they they got liquidated right was it was it i i remember
[17034.52s -> 17046.14s]  like in bioshock infinite i thought it was fun but i mean bioshock one about the pandemic help me out
[17046.14s -> 17064.92s]  here this is like every video game company i'm trying pandemic was what battlefront destroy all
[17064.92s -> 17085.67s]  humans okay all right all right okay hold on i liked those respawn entertainment that's uh it's
[17085.67s -> 17096.36s]  like yeah i don't i don't play their games atari doesn't really exist anymore they still kind of
[17096.36s -> 17101.32s]  do what's the last thing that isn't the last game they made like a dragon ball z fighting game
[17102.04s -> 17119.77s]  i have not enough experience recently i know they're a classic company but we're talking like
[17119.77s -> 17124.57s]  recently like the last five to ten years no oh i don't know where the fuck they belong probably
[17124.57s -> 17135.94s]  up here santa monica studio is the god of war studio right or is that technically sony
[17136.66s -> 17157.62s]  they belong up here it's god of war yeah okay yep no they but they they belong up here all
[17157.62s -> 17166.81s]  their games are like just always good sierra like it's hard to mix in these really old ass
[17166.81s -> 17184.26s]  fucking companies with the ones that are currently you know what i mean there's too many impressive
[17184.26s -> 17199.58s]  game what is impressive games what what did they do no that's a super massive games until dawn
[17205.90s -> 17214.89s]  here's the thing trying to do this is tricky because not only is it the games that they made
[17215.94s -> 17222.02s]  but each company has like a separate tier of games that they've made so all right like sega for
[17222.02s -> 17227.94s]  instance sega as a whole exists and then when you double click sega you get the big drop down of
[17227.94s -> 17242.66s]  like 50 games so try it's hard to place them this tier list is fucked well hold on let me
[17243.30s -> 17258.76s]  let me do this first um i know it's gonna be like this i'm gonna let me work backwards
[17308.78s -> 17331.99s]  uh it's taking a lot of brain power to do this all right um this is hitman right this is guys
[17331.99s -> 17353.83s]  hitman i'm working it up see why are you doing an la noir face so uh where were you uh at four
[17353.83s -> 17381.10s]  o'clock eastern time were you in front of the store i can't even fucking do it now all i think
[17381.10s -> 17391.46s]  about is you guys looking at me with like three buttons that are watching my face gearbox is down
[17391.46s -> 17412.38s]  here i don't i'm sorry gear i'm telling you we're good gearbox is i don't borderlands you can
[17412.38s -> 17434.63s]  borderlands i don't care about borderlands no it's not f it's but why are these even on here
[17437.80s -> 17445.62s]  bethesda is still like making games though konami is not let's just be very very clear about this
[17446.97s -> 17453.74s]  konami doesn't even make fucking video games anymore didn't they like abandon their video
[17453.74s -> 17473.22s]  game development ea is very close to d-minus well let's get back up here naughty dog versus
[17473.22s -> 17480.49s]  insomniac i don't think i'm i'm gonna leave this alone i think this is accurate hold on what was
[17480.49s -> 17500.89s]  the last couple nintendo games that i played mario maker 2 smash brothers no yeah no they're
[17500.89s -> 17509.48s]  still making really good stuff they are so is rock star so is capcom so it's sony santa monica
[17509.48s -> 17514.60s]  just released like one of the best games like ever fucking made right like ever according to
[17514.60s -> 17519.00s]  a lot of people i haven't played it i don't know i've played some of the other ones it's a lie

[17585.11s -> 17615.61s]  lucas arts should be up here technically technically games like tf2 dota and cs go they still get
[17615.61s -> 17625.93s]  updates technically so i mean you can't like valve has a bunch of stuff in development right
[17625.93s -> 17634.01s]  now don't they this would be all the way up here it would but a valve being down at c is already
[17634.01s -> 17644.33s]  like a huge fucking issue that's a huge deal imagine this list five years ago if valve wasn't
[17644.33s -> 17669.00s]  up here i would be a crazy person so this is already very bad um bungee shouldn't be down that
[17669.00s -> 17690.63s]  far rare has to do something rare has to do something rare they have to go down here i'm

[18110.31s -> 18130.97s]  things my fucking legacy how is ico i was t i go not an a we'll get hope just i listen to me
[18132.38s -> 18138.81s]  the issue with doing a video game company tier list is as if every single one of these was a
[18138.81s -> 18146.39s]  version of in and out moving one of these causes a huge issue for a bunch of people every one of
[18146.39s -> 18159.34s]  these is in and out burger but like in and out different uh like variations of it so all of them
[18159.34s -> 18180.33s]  are bad i didn't say it i didn't say that you did i have to okay if this is the thing that people
[18180.33s -> 18188.20s]  remember you for i'm sorry not anything else germa 985's legacy is remember that one time he
[18188.20s -> 18201.16s]  did the games company tier list yeah that's true if this is what i leave behind then i didn't leave
[18201.16s -> 18210.34s]  very much you have thousands of hours of online content thousands of hours this is my legacy
[18210.34s -> 18230.82s]  that's embarrassing i don't even know all right remedy you're shafting valve if you've gotten
[18230.82s -> 18237.82s]  your orange box origins that's why valve's not down here the valve like artifact that wasn't
[18238.62s -> 18243.26s]  like a big deal and people i didn't think it was any i didn't really was interested i wasn't
[18243.26s -> 18248.18s]  interested at all i didn't really wasn't interested in dota they had like a bunch of other projects
[18248.18s -> 18260.82s]  they kind of swept out of the rug i'm only doing this because of i'm only doing this because of
[18260.82s -> 18272.06s]  the spy dota underlords is worse than the game mode in dota this is the fucking craziest thing
[18272.06s -> 18281.30s]  guys do you understand what's happening in video games right now you have a game a video game
[18281.94s -> 18292.52s]  that was a mod for starcraft which then became a mod for warcraft which then turned into a full
[18292.52s -> 18303.03s]  game which then that full game was oh we're gonna make that one too so that is a a sort of copy
[18303.75s -> 18313.75s]  of a mod and then you have inside of that copy of a mod you have a mod inside of that game that
[18313.75s -> 18323.43s]  was a mod which was auto chess and is now becoming a mod of a copy of a copy of a mod from a game
[18323.43s -> 18344.70s]  from 1998 what in the name of god is happening what's going on mod game mod game original mod
[18347.94s -> 18356.54s]  yo dude i heard you like mods it's just chess no my point is is that it's a everyone's start
[18356.54s -> 18360.66s]  people are starting to want to make their own auto chess is now and they want to make their own
[18360.66s -> 18370.30s]  auto chess is based inside of a game that was a mod is wild i i almost want to like make a uh
[18371.02s -> 18376.70s]  like a chart that shows like the origin the originations of where all these things came from
[18377.35s -> 18390.01s]  it's so interesting fortnight auto chess all right i'm about to detonate the whole thing
[18394.38s -> 18407.54s]  the first two or three rows i it's gonna be too hard and there's all this shit i don't even know
[18407.54s -> 18427.24s]  what to put here comes a volcano joke why is ea not s tier i got thousand voices in my head
[18430.94s -> 18435.58s]  all you need to know just i'm gonna cover this up this is all you need this is like 2019 this is

[18456.02s -> 18459.94s]  know why these are up here obsidian uh monolith valve is like right here valve is up here valve
[18459.94s -> 18475.61s]  okay valve wasn't the last mode of combat game trash i don't know i i was it i thought it was
[18475.69s -> 18487.54s]  good didn't people really like it all right that's it i just hit myself in a really bad place
[18487.54s -> 18504.15s]  accidentally and it was right on that that was really really close to being a huge issue
[18504.15s -> 18514.68s]  i just like whacked myself in the thigh area i'm good all right we're gonna finish this stream up
[18516.39s -> 18531.59s]  with some cool math games but which one am i gonna even play i need my uh headphones for this
[18532.23s -> 18537.46s]  i was just putting five hours of this damn i'm having a pretty good time
[18538.18s -> 18546.38s]  it's kind of been flown by so tomorrow let's talk about tomorrow i'm thinking of uh i'm thinking
[18546.38s -> 18552.55s]  of doing dos again you want to do a dos night tomorrow tomorrow night do and looks like okay
[18552.55s -> 18564.18s]  the internet's been a lot better people have been waiting for that for a long time we'll go back to
[18564.26s -> 18581.69s]  dos tomorrow uh somebody says uh play run two all right i'll try run two how what is run two

[18634.87s -> 18650.34s]  math at all uh okay this might be loud i'm gonna turn it down all right controls uh left space
[18651.30s -> 18658.95s]  pause and reset so just jump okay i'm gonna easier to control can't jump as far hard it
[18658.95s -> 18668.87s]  jumps farther and hard to control use the right and left arrow keys to move side this is really
[18668.87s -> 18693.27s]  really fucking loud collect all the okay uh see if you can collect the bonuses all right all right
[18693.59s -> 18706.44s]  first contact with a wall bonus not earned select level okay let's go level two it's the wrong way
[18707.32s -> 18731.67s]  how do i get this is why it's a math game right how do i get that one how do i get this bonus
[18733.43s -> 18760.74s]  i don't know how to get this bonus oh you can jump into the walls i didn't know that you could do
[18760.74s -> 18775.98s]  that i thought you had to touch them on the side we don't i don't get the bonuses who gives a shit
[18776.94s -> 18791.93s]  all right this is like a little got it uh you can catch here but you cannot catch here
[18792.65s -> 18837.35s]  this is a baby game this is a cool math game actually oh i'm good shit this is actually
[18837.35s -> 18856.81s]  kind of this is pretty fun do run three or i'm gonna pee my pants well go for it man this takes
[18856.81s -> 18884.25s]  a lot of concentration can i not get up there all right got it bonus fuck damn it whatever up up up

[18978.65s -> 19023.51s]  come on what oh my god i'm so stupid i have to wait wait why am i addicted to this cool math game
[19025.03s -> 19025.83s]  whatever just end it
[19042.52s -> 19049.40s]  holy shit what is going on all right i can hold on i can drop down drop down get this jump over jump

[19410.62s -> 19424.04s]  i you gotta jump through the holes holy shit you have to spin it around damn all right
[19448.66s -> 19453.05s]  oh man i gotta get that come on 21 that's the blackjack number i can do it
[19454.33s -> 19475.88s]  got it all right 22 this is the last one this is actually the last one damn how do i do that i
[19475.88s -> 19502.60s]  gotta jump underneath it yeah you gotta go underneath no you don't got it okay 23 is a
[19502.60s -> 19508.10s]  scary number it's like the satan number i can't i can't i'll get 24 i can't end on the scary one
[19525.24s -> 19561.00s]  24 i can't end on that one 25 that's like a good even one he's doing an oblivion face
[19571.66s -> 19583.29s]  all right all right okay i'm good go we're good we're good i did it i won i okay i won what's the
[19583.29s -> 19601.19s]  next one what's another like really good one in the time we have remaining play run three uh run
[19601.19s -> 19611.02s]  three is not as popular as run two let me see what we got we've got b cubed i feel like i can't do
[19611.02s -> 19625.98s]  that one run two block sores awesome tanks parking fury papa's sushi ria there is no game what is
[19625.98s -> 19639.03s]  there is no game block sores block block block yeah all right right flip the block over this way
[19639.03s -> 19642.55s]  and over that way to get it to fall in the hole you'll be flipping blocks in your sleep
[19643.19s -> 19657.61s]  okay let's do it make sure you can see what i'm doing here cool math needs to be moved i think
[19660.68s -> 19685.53s]  something uh block sores does it fit all right so the aim of the game is to get the block to fall
[19685.53s -> 19694.95s]  into the square hole at the end of each stage there are 33 stages so to move the block around
[19694.95s -> 19701.37s]  use left right up and down arrow keys be careful not to fall off the edge well here we go get the
[19701.37s -> 19705.77s]  block to fall into the square at hole at the end of each stage there are 33 stages all right
[19706.33s -> 19710.44s]  move the block around the world use left and right up and down be careful not to fall off the edge
[19711.00s -> 19726.26s]  the level we restarted if you do now it's such a weird this is such a weird game to capture
[19727.06s -> 19735.67s]  is that better bridges and switches are located in many levels switches are activated when they are
[19735.67s -> 19742.47s]  pressed right you do not need to stay resting on the switch to keep it open heavy x-shaped ones
[19742.47s -> 19749.46s]  and soft round ones soft switches are activated when any part of your block presses it hard
[19749.46s -> 19753.30s]  which required much more pressure so your block must be standing on it to activate it okay
[19754.26s -> 19758.71s]  when activated each switch may behave differently some will swap the bridges from open to closed
[19758.71s -> 19766.46s]  yeah there's a different stuff pump up the iq for this one green or red colored squares will
[19766.46s -> 19773.74s]  flash to indicate which bridges are being operated orange tiles are far more fragile
[19773.74s -> 19777.10s]  than the rest of the land if your block stands up vertically on an orange tile tile will give
[19777.10s -> 19787.14s]  way and your block will fall this this parentheses switch teleports your block to different locations
[19788.02s -> 19794.97s]  splitting it into two smaller blocks that's why i think this might be a little too much for me
[19794.97s -> 19798.97s]  this might this might be it might be not too much for like an eighth grader but it's too much for me
[19805.67s -> 19811.70s]  okay you can select different blocks the passcode for each stage
[19814.98s -> 19825.90s]  it is located in the top right corner so the dead it's like megaman let's go now that i can see the
[19825.90s -> 19941.43s]  screen all right i get it he was joking funny man pretending to be stupid he is enlightened he's a
[19949.56s -> 19992.49s]  stop no shit wait pretty good oh shit he was just pretending to be funny man he was pretending to be
[19992.49s -> 20042.25s]  funny guy what is that doing no i'm good i'm good i'm good i'm good i'm good i'm good everything's
[20042.25s -> 20052.95s]  fine what do i think about this game i think it's pretty sweet i think it belongs with top two video
[20052.95s -> 20137.82s]  games on this site fuck i did it and i went too far great i forgot i forgot i'm streaming you're
[20137.82s -> 20155.00s]  right i i'm streaming um right i'm not just playing cool math games alone um i'm stumped
[20155.00s -> 20173.35s]  i'm stumped on this one i think guys they stumped me yeah they stumped me all right what's next what's
[20173.35s -> 20178.87s]  next on uh okay what's next can you play something else this game sucks this game doesn't suck i think
[20178.87s -> 20192.66s]  it's pretty cool what's next all right we're going back i never beat this one so yeah uh candy jump
[20192.66s -> 20217.45s]  duck life rob the robber jacksmith papa's papa what a papa game basketball master two papa's
[20217.45s -> 20241.75s]  pizzeria what about papa's bakery papa's bakery no no balloons no balloons papa's pizzeria why is

[21261.90s -> 21277.51s]  fun it's getting late well we're we're approaching somewhere around midnight pacific had to start
[21277.51s -> 21283.88s]  late so sorry that we had to start so late but the internet was horrible but i'm thinking that
[21283.88s -> 21294.73s]  this vpn may have helped six hours 93 less than 10 000 drop frames in six hours is actually pretty
[21294.73s -> 21309.16s]  good let's see what happens tomorrow because we i did i gotta do a test for at least a few days
[21309.16s -> 21314.73s]  because you've we've seen this internet be perfect and then it's been oh drop 30 000 frames
[21315.61s -> 21323.48s]  we'll see how it goes but i had a lot of fun i like to do this i like to just kind of hang out and
[21324.36s -> 21328.84s]  talk shit and play random stuff and just be on cam but it doesn't happen that often doesn't happen
[21328.84s -> 21336.97s]  that often can't wait to not see half the carnival stream because of this well lucky for all of us
[21336.97s -> 21344.42s]  the carnival stream is not happening in las vegas like here i'm gonna be on location for that
[21345.22s -> 21356.73s]  so it's not happening here in vegas that's all you that's all you need to know
[21358.18s -> 21368.04s]  speak of the devil just dropped a frame right there on location with worse internet now that
[21368.04s -> 21375.02s]  would be sad i don't think that's gonna happen it's not it's not even gonna be in the state of
[21375.02s -> 21383.02s]  nevada it's uh across the country actually what happens now now we uh we we wind down a little
[21384.36s -> 21390.66s]  we say good night we turn off this screen so again tomorrow we're gonna do uh dos
[21393.58s -> 21397.18s]  join me for dos tomorrow we're gonna play there's at least a few of them that i think would be fun
[21397.18s -> 21409.35s]  to do uh sorry we had to start at like 5 30 pacific tonight it's not my intention
[21409.35s -> 21422.60s]  and i probably lost some of the subs from six or seven hours ago i'm sorry about that
[21423.48s -> 21430.42s]  when the stream gets killed like that i lose subs but uh we'll try again tomorrow
[21433.54s -> 21449.94s]  dos games and let's go back to earlier what is the german smile well that's terrifying
[21452.23s -> 21459.43s]  but thank you to frodian weapon for the 250 sorry for almost spoiling uh redacted
[21459.99s -> 21463.75s]  i did not get the memo if it makes you feel better i do feel bad about it so could you please call
[21463.75s -> 21469.67s]  off your small battalion of rats i haven't actually seen one yet but i know they're there
[21469.67s -> 21481.66s]  among us people unsubscribe over that no no no no i mean i don't have uh i do credits at the end
[21481.66s -> 21489.26s]  of the stream they scroll up and when a stream gets dropped to zero and i have to stop it
[21489.90s -> 21493.42s]  there's new credits that are made because it only takes the subs that come through
[21494.38s -> 21501.74s]  for that vod for that broadcast not the one from earlier so every time a new vod is created or a
[21501.74s -> 21512.25s]  drop to zero the subs kind of start at zero again it's annoying but it happens no i don't mean like
[21512.25s -> 21518.09s]  people are unsubscribing over that you know just the plug-in doesn't really work so well
[21519.42s -> 21528.78s]  but uh what i don't know fronty what are you talking about here what spoiler for what uh
[21528.78s -> 21536.20s]  jared done thanks for the ten dollars and 60 cents uh jared and also gave uh a hundred
[21536.20s -> 21546.90s]  fucking dollars and they say how do i subscribe and there should be a button down there but
[21546.98s -> 21554.49s]  regardless you have uh you have subscribed a shitload of times already by giving me like a
[21554.49s -> 21564.22s]  hundred and fucking plus dollars so i don't worry about that thank you there was a string of like
[21564.22s -> 21575.45s]  three or four hundred bucks in a row here earlier we got them all but thank you guys so much the
[21575.45s -> 21580.57s]  amount of money that comes in for sometimes is just fucking outrageous i can't even comprehend it
[21582.86s -> 21591.42s]  you guys are too much thank you uh we also had ten dollars come in from germa's nuts
[21592.14s -> 21599.98s]  say my name coward i said your name last night too i said it last night
[21605.88s -> 21614.74s]  but thank you i do appreciate hey buster boy thanks for the three dollars buster boy
[21615.94s -> 21618.98s]  don't forget you promised to lip sync the entirety of mambo number five
[21619.62s -> 21625.54s]  germa lied about lip syncing mambo number five i'm sure it's already been created drinking skills
[21625.54s -> 21635.91s]  came in with five community subs right now thank you thank you drinking skills appreciate it i did
[21635.91s -> 21649.27s]  i did it yesterday there's a clip of me uh lip syncing the first like 12 25 seconds there's
[21649.27s -> 21655.19s]  only one bit message that you can't see and it's five dollars and 37 from bingus tingle that said
[21655.19s -> 21663.54s]  germa when are you gonna play ed ed and eddie online is this the deep fake one let's see
[21671.37s -> 21695.98s]  yeah this is not even real this is deep fake you're right well i see people put me in situations
[21695.98s -> 21705.78s]  they deep fake me i can hear it in the distance uh but thank you uh buster boy for the three bucks
[21710.30s -> 21714.86s]  thank you to stiff funky chicken for the three bucks i don't know if you're in the mood for
[21714.86s -> 21718.78s]  watching videos this stream but i made some pretty short ones no links in chat so you can find the
[21718.78s -> 21725.54s]  three vids on youtube under this username uh hold the videos because we're going to do a
[21726.82s -> 21732.82s]  i'm gonna do it we're gonna do a once a month or once every probably to keep make sure that like
[21732.82s -> 21737.38s]  clips and videos are relevant and art is relevant we'll probably do it once every couple weeks
[21738.82s -> 21749.82s]  a video art community segment i've decided it's probably a good idea but i want to do
[21749.82s -> 21759.35s]  more than once a month because i once you do it stuff like that like i feel like mambo number five
[21759.99s -> 21765.91s]  stuff would not necessarily be relevant in like a month right so if somebody were to do something
[21769.50s -> 21780.01s]  every like two or three weeks i think sounds pretty good i like that idea but hold on to some
[21780.01s -> 21785.96s]  of that stuff we'll have an avenue for that eventually here over the coming a few weeks i
[21785.96s -> 21793.72s]  think a couple weeks probably but i do appreciate anything that you make you guys are really fucking
[21793.72s -> 21803.10s]  talented but thank you thank you dork cube for the 250 this candy tier list is inherently flawed
[21803.10s -> 21808.38s]  because it doesn't include all the types of m&m's i might agree that plain m&m's are f or d tier but
[21808.38s -> 21815.58s]  coffee nut m&m's a tier pretzel m&m's s tier also all this candy talk is reminding me of when

[21823.58s -> 21827.42s]  uh with a candy catapult like like launch it out like a t-shirt
[21836.06s -> 21859.24s]  walmart boy scouts a candy catapult that's so ridiculous m&m's are worthy of a b
