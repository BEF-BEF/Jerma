[2.10s -> 4.30s]  Oh god, oh dear god.
[4.30s -> 9.83s]  Alright, let me open this game. See if I can do it.
[9.83s -> 18.53s]  It's called... I think it's called Super... Psycho Baseball or something.
[18.53s -> 23.73s]  MVP Baseball 2005. Well, that's actually the greatest baseball game ever made, so...
[23.73s -> 31.40s]  You know what sucks about that? Do you guys remember?
[31.40s -> 36.17s]  So MVP Baseball was the best baseball game that's ever been made,
[36.17s -> 43.08s]  and then 2K sniped the rights to all of baseball, and they couldn't make it anymore.
[43.08s -> 49.15s]  A few years later, they made an NCAA version of the game, which was still amazing.
[49.15s -> 53.22s]  It was still really good, but they couldn't make baseball games anymore,
[53.22s -> 58.63s]  because there was a feud where, if you remember, EA made MVP Baseball.
[58.63s -> 63.46s]  EA also makes Madden, and they got the exclusive rights to football.
[63.46s -> 67.84s]  Nobody else could make an officially licensed football game, right, unless you were first party.
[67.84s -> 71.89s]  So, right, third... I believe third-party game developers couldn't make them.
[71.99s -> 83.46s]  So, I think that 2K was like, hey, fine, you want football? We'll buy the rights to baseball.
[83.46s -> 89.22s]  And I remember being very, very sad, because I actually did not like Madden at all.
[89.22s -> 93.40s]  I liked the EA baseball games, not the EA football games.
[93.40s -> 100.46s]  And I would have much rather they did it reverse and just bought, you know, the rights to it,
[100.46s -> 102.06s]  for the baseball games that are football.
[102.06s -> 108.39s]  But Madden is way more popular than MVP ever was.
[108.39s -> 112.07s]  What was it? What game were we playing? Oh, yeah, right.
[112.07s -> 115.71s]  All right, this is called... Yeah, Super Psycho Baseball.
[115.71s -> 118.31s]  This has been recommended a few times in the recommended Discord.
[118.31s -> 123.77s]  By the way, if you don't know, the Discord has a recommended channel.
[123.77s -> 133.01s]  I look at it all the time, and here's proof.
[133.01s -> 142.80s]  I think I need to capture it a different way. Let's see.
[142.80s -> 152.76s]  Uh-huh, there we go.
[152.76s -> 158.97s]  All right, so I don't know, this... Let's give it a try.
[158.97s -> 168.21s]  Can one of the mods change the title?
[168.21s -> 173.78s]  Hey there, nice to see you again. You lost the game? Figured.
[173.78s -> 176.09s]  I haven't even played.
[176.09s -> 179.24s]  Play ball!
[179.24s -> 182.86s]  What? How do I hit? Why am I so small?
[182.86s -> 187.07s]  How do I hit the baseball?
[187.07s -> 206.02s]  Oh, I have HP? That's got to be out.
[206.02s -> 216.62s]  God damn it. How do you hit a home run?
[216.62s -> 220.64s]  I'm going to lose. I don't even know how to play.
[220.64s -> 225.00s]  You got to get just under it.
[225.00s -> 227.21s]  Let's go on. Go on!
[228.67s -> 230.97s]  Good. All right. I get it. I get it. I understand. I understand.
[230.97s -> 235.99s]  Let's go. Go on.
[242.42s -> 244.30s]  Go on.
[251.63s -> 253.50s]  Go on.
[261.28s -> 263.35s]  That's how you come back and you win.
[263.35s -> 264.25s]  Five in a row.
[265.05s -> 268.04s]  At the very last out.
[268.04s -> 268.54s]  Unbelievable.
[268.54s -> 273.18s]  That's one inning down. Two to go.
[273.18s -> 274.08s]  All right, first inning.
[274.08s -> 277.03s]  Do I still have only 10 HP? Whoa, hold on.
[277.03s -> 279.50s]  112 coins.
[279.50s -> 282.10s]  Heal 20 HP.
[282.10s -> 283.00s]  Devil's Pack.
[283.00s -> 283.90s]  Sell your soul.
[283.90s -> 288.05s]  Regain 5% of your max HP with every home run.
[288.05s -> 289.75s]  Nerd glasses.
[289.75s -> 291.15s]  You put on a pair of specs.
[291.15s -> 294.59s]  Increases range of a perfect hit.
[294.59s -> 295.79s]  You have an even bigger heart.
[295.79s -> 300.37s]  You might want to see a doctor, but HP is max HP by 30.
[300.37s -> 305.68s]  I mean, I think it's the nerd glasses, right?
[305.68s -> 309.04s]  How much do I have? I need to heal.
[309.04s -> 310.95s]  You only get to pick one.
[310.95s -> 313.75s]  He's throwing a lot faster now, but I think that's still gone.
[313.75s -> 316.26s]  That makes six in a row.
[316.26s -> 317.96s]  He's throwing so fast.
[317.96s -> 322.67s]  I picked the shittiest upgrade.
[322.67s -> 330.13s]  He's on fire. That's seven in a row.
[330.13s -> 336.74s]  That's gone. Get out!
[336.74s -> 342.55s]  Sorry.
[342.55s -> 344.15s]  He's throwing, so I...
[344.15s -> 344.65s]  Whatever.
[344.65s -> 347.05s]  It's okay. Sometimes you lose in level one.
[347.05s -> 352.95s]  If you're bad.
[352.95s -> 356.02s]  You get that first time somebody plays.
[356.02s -> 358.12s]  You're supposed to say, hey, try again.
[358.12s -> 359.32s]  That was the tutorial.
[359.32s -> 360.12s]  Now you know how to play.
[360.12s -> 362.52s]  So now don't click one power up.
[368.08s -> 368.88s]  All right, let's go.
[368.88s -> 371.88s]  Okay, I understand how it works.
[371.88s -> 372.98s]  I'm going for it now.
[372.98s -> 375.82s]  Sorry if I hit you.
[375.82s -> 382.77s]  I've had a bad day.
[382.77s -> 385.74s]  Play ball!
[385.74s -> 387.14s]  Started off good.
[387.14s -> 395.34s]  Goodbye baseball.
[395.34s -> 401.77s]  Goodbye baseball.
[401.77s -> 403.77s]  You got to get just under it.
[403.77s -> 411.30s]  Three in a row.
[411.30s -> 412.70s]  That's good enough, right?
[412.70s -> 414.14s]  Four in a row.
[414.14s -> 414.74s]  All right.
[414.74s -> 415.84s]  Good start.
[415.84s -> 420.86s]  Shit.
[420.86s -> 427.00s]  It's okay.
[427.00s -> 427.90s]  That's a moon shot.
[427.90s -> 428.80s]  All right, now let me...
[428.80s -> 429.30s]  I got...
[429.30s -> 431.10s]  Honey hell, let me not waste this.
[431.10s -> 432.40s]  That's one inning down.
[432.40s -> 437.90s]  Two to go.
[437.90s -> 439.34s]  Okay.
[439.34s -> 440.44s]  Your bat grows in size.
[440.44s -> 441.24s]  Hitbox size.
[441.24s -> 443.71s]  I kind of want that.
[443.71s -> 444.51s]  More HP.
[444.51s -> 445.21s]  You know what it is.
[445.21s -> 446.21s]  Power boosted.
[446.21s -> 448.78s]  Oh, I think I might go for the power.
[448.78s -> 453.76s]  Should I take the steroids?
[453.76s -> 454.70s]  All right.
[454.70s -> 455.40s]  Go ahead.
[455.40s -> 462.25s]  Call me a one-pitch Andy.
[462.25s -> 463.45s]  No, this is going to work.
[463.45s -> 465.91s]  This is going to work pretty well.
[465.91s -> 468.72s]  One-pitch Andy.
[468.72s -> 474.78s]  Don't get over it.
[474.78s -> 482.66s]  Goodbye baseball.
[482.66s -> 484.95s]  Home.
[484.95s -> 488.83s]  All right.
[488.83s -> 490.37s]  Jesus.
[490.37s -> 490.77s]  I had...
[490.77s -> 492.73s]  That's enough, I think.
[492.73s -> 500.64s]  Three in a row.
[500.64s -> 500.84s]  There we go.
[500.84s -> 501.14s]  All right.
[501.14s -> 501.54s]  What am I buying next?
[501.54s -> 506.20s]  Four in a row.
[506.20s -> 507.80s]  Another inning in the book.
[507.80s -> 512.92s]  One more to go.
[512.92s -> 513.32s]  Hundred and...
[513.32s -> 513.72s]  All right.
[513.72s -> 516.11s]  Steroids two.
[516.11s -> 516.51s]  I don't have enough.
[516.51s -> 521.34s]  Should I hold it?
[521.34s -> 528.37s]  I think I buy this and hold this one.
[528.37s -> 532.32s]  Because I'll get this next.
[532.32s -> 533.89s]  Psycho mode activated.
[533.89s -> 534.69s]  What does that mean?
[534.69s -> 536.09s]  One last shot.
[536.09s -> 543.33s]  I'm going to throw really hard this time.
[543.33s -> 544.23s]  No fucking way.
[544.23s -> 552.84s]  It's literally impossible.
[552.84s -> 553.14s]  Come on.
[553.14s -> 555.37s]  Get out.
[555.37s -> 563.97s]  Home.
[563.97s -> 570.45s]  Home.
[570.45s -> 570.85s]  Come on.
[570.85s -> 571.82s]  Up.
[572.82s -> 589.39s]  That's a loop.
[589.39s -> 593.10s]  Goodbye baseball.
[593.10s -> 594.20s]  We had a raid?
[594.20s -> 595.73s]  Hold on, hold on.
[595.73s -> 599.83s]  Oh my goodness.
[599.83s -> 600.53s]  No.
[600.53s -> 601.43s]  No, no, no, no.
[601.43s -> 604.15s]  Not in the last pitch.
[604.15s -> 604.85s]  Thank God.
[604.85s -> 607.13s]  I fucking actually nailed it.
[607.13s -> 610.95s]  It's out of here.
[610.95s -> 614.65s]  Oh no, I lost and I have to go home to my super hot girlfriend.
[614.65s -> 615.65s]  You...
[615.65s -> 616.05s]  You completed...
[616.05s -> 616.75s]  You advanced.
[616.75s -> 620.28s]  I advanced?
[620.28s -> 624.23s]  We had like three raids come in.
[624.23s -> 627.59s]  Bruce Green,
[627.59s -> 628.59s]  Sideshow,
[628.59s -> 630.16s]  and Bren.
[630.16s -> 634.08s]  What's up?
[634.08s -> 635.35s]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[635.45s -> 638.51s]  Thanks, everybody.
[638.51s -> 639.21s]  Welcome to the channel.
[639.21s -> 641.31s]  We're playing this baseball game.
[641.31s -> 644.06s]  It's pretty cool.
[644.06s -> 645.26s]  It's called Super Psycho Baseball.
[645.26s -> 648.15s]  Hope you had good streams.
[648.15s -> 651.73s]  I'm ready to rock and roll.
[651.73s -> 652.43s]  Raid songs?
[652.43s -> 656.82s]  We don't do raid songs.
[656.82s -> 657.02s]  All right.
[657.02s -> 659.60s]  I'm definitely doing steroids, though.
[659.60s -> 665.16s]  Hope you guys are fans of baseball.
[665.16s -> 669.95s]  Or should I be conservative here?
[669.95s -> 677.63s]  I feel like this is a big deal.
[677.63s -> 682.41s]  Uh...
[682.41s -> 690.47s]  So many of my brothers chopped berries.
[690.47s -> 691.17s]  Play ball!
[691.17s -> 694.46s]  I only have 10 HP.
[694.46s -> 700.91s]  Adios, baseball.
[700.91s -> 702.71s]  That was fucked up.
[702.71s -> 705.41s]  Now you, too, have experienced loss.
[705.41s -> 710.53s]  They made Super Psycho.
[710.53s -> 711.23s]  Do I start at the beginning,
[711.23s -> 712.73s]  or do I start at the tree?
[712.73s -> 714.24s]  Shit.
[714.24s -> 715.34s]  Let's hurry this up.
[715.34s -> 722.26s]  I've got a pit.
[722.26s -> 726.47s]  Play ball!
[726.47s -> 727.17s]  Oh, come on.
[727.17s -> 732.69s]  That was perfect.
[732.69s -> 740.59s]  It's out of here.
[740.59s -> 741.89s]  That's a moonshot.
[741.89s -> 744.49s]  So I need to do accuracy.
[744.49s -> 748.66s]  I think it's more important.
[748.66s -> 757.88s]  Three in a row.
[757.88s -> 759.90s]  Four in a row.
[759.90s -> 771.26s]  Rogue-like baseball.
[771.26s -> 771.96s]  I...
[771.96s -> 775.78s]  How did I swing through that?
[775.78s -> 777.08s]  Um, I lost it.
[777.08s -> 781.40s]  I'm playing really poorly now.
[781.40s -> 786.90s]  Oh, come on.
[786.90s -> 798.58s]  Come on! Restart.
[798.58s -> 799.08s]  Hey.
[799.08s -> 800.18s]  My name's Pitchy.
[800.18s -> 805.34s]  And I got a hell of a fastball.
[805.34s -> 806.24s]  Keep your eye on the ball.
[806.24s -> 806.84s]  I'm trying.
[806.84s -> 817.88s]  Play ball!
[817.88s -> 823.85s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[823.85s -> 825.55s]  You got all of that one.
[825.55s -> 826.25s]  Perfect.
[826.25s -> 828.13s]  Shit.
[828.13s -> 829.43s]  That's a moonshot.
[829.43s -> 836.65s]  I don't have more than 20 coins?
[836.65s -> 845.68s]  Three in a row.
[845.68s -> 853.54s]  Four in a row.
[853.54s -> 855.30s]  Okay. Next inning.
[855.30s -> 856.00s]  Count it.
[856.00s -> 857.30s]  Five in a row.
[857.30s -> 859.50s]  How did I get more coins for less distance?
[859.50s -> 861.46s]  That's one inning down.
[861.46s -> 862.36s]  Two to go.
[862.36s -> 866.34s]  All right.
[866.34s -> 867.34s]  Can you talk a little louder?
[867.34s -> 869.04s]  Vinnie's stream is a little loud right now.
[869.04s -> 873.25s]  What...
[873.25s -> 876.62s]  What are you doing?
[876.62s -> 882.79s]  What are you doing?
[882.79s -> 883.99s]  Five percent does not sound like...
[883.99s -> 895.42s]  It's not very much.
[895.42s -> 898.31s]  These two are effectively the same power-up.
[898.31s -> 905.48s]  Technically, right?
[905.48s -> 907.38s]  I'll go ahead and tip you my next pitch.
[907.38s -> 912.18s]  It's a fastball.
[912.18s -> 915.67s]  That makes six in a row.
[915.67s -> 919.67s]  I need health.
[919.67s -> 921.57s]  That was a really hard pitch to hit and I got it.
[921.57s -> 929.56s]  I didn't get under it enough.
[929.56s -> 937.91s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[937.91s -> 944.30s]  It's out of here.
[944.30s -> 947.35s]  That's enough.
[947.35s -> 959.50s]  Three in a row.
[959.50s -> 960.00s]  All right.
[960.00s -> 964.94s]  I've got 70 percent.
[964.94s -> 966.44s]  Another inning in the book.
[966.44s -> 970.82s]  One more to go.
[970.82s -> 971.52s]  Breath of the Wild.
[971.52s -> 977.30s]  I don't have my switch set up over here.
[977.30s -> 979.90s]  It's definitely this one.
[979.90s -> 982.01s]  I need the health.
[982.01s -> 985.93s]  Five percent HP every time you hit a home run.
[985.93s -> 988.36s]  Psycho mode.
[988.36s -> 990.96s]  It's the final inning and I'm all oiled up.
[990.96s -> 999.97s]  Let's go.
[999.97s -> 1002.93s]  Is that enough?
[1002.93s -> 1009.16s]  It's out of here.
[1009.16s -> 1009.96s]  That's got to be enough.
[1009.96s -> 1011.67s]  Yep.
[1011.67s -> 1018.22s]  Home run.
[1018.22s -> 1026.18s]  What a... That pitch was so...
[1026.18s -> 1027.58s]  Adios, baseball.
[1027.58s -> 1032.66s]  This game is hard.
[1032.66s -> 1040.13s]  That wasn't even in the strike zone.
[1040.13s -> 1050.79s]  It's out of here.
[1050.79s -> 1051.09s]  There you go.
[1051.09s -> 1052.38s]  All right.
[1052.38s -> 1052.98s]  Next inning.
[1052.98s -> 1053.28s]  Next.
[1053.28s -> 1056.96s]  Adios, baseball.
[1056.96s -> 1057.56s]  You're just bad.
[1057.56s -> 1060.90s]  It's not my fault I was only programmed to throw a fastball.
[1060.90s -> 1062.50s]  Move the camera to the top right.
[1062.50s -> 1065.82s]  Uh, hold on.
[1065.82s -> 1067.52s]  It's this.
[1067.52s -> 1076.86s]  Right?
[1076.86s -> 1082.29s]  Big bat.
[1082.29s -> 1086.66s]  That's 10 health every time I hit a home run.
[1086.66s -> 1090.13s]  But this means I'll hit more home runs.
[1090.13s -> 1092.33s]  I'm going for this.
[1092.33s -> 1092.53s]  All right.
[1092.53s -> 1094.66s]  Come on.
[1094.66s -> 1099.59s]  This tree throws curveballs.
[1099.59s -> 1099.79s]  All right.
[1099.79s -> 1101.93s]  Just zone in.
[1101.93s -> 1105.82s]  Walk in and go for it.
[1105.82s -> 1112.63s]  That's so fucked up.
[1112.63s -> 1115.27s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[1115.27s -> 1120.35s]  Give me the health.
[1120.35s -> 1131.78s]  Hit the pole.
[1131.78s -> 1141.07s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[1141.07s -> 1141.87s]  Thank God for the heal.
[1141.87s -> 1149.01s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[1149.01s -> 1149.51s]  All right.
[1149.51s -> 1151.08s]  Now we're working.
[1151.08s -> 1169.29s]  Three in a row.
[1169.29s -> 1172.42s]  Okay, inning two.
[1172.42s -> 1182.40s]  How did that not go out?
[1182.40s -> 1183.00s]  All right.
[1183.00s -> 1185.02s]  Good.
[1185.02s -> 1187.38s]  It's out of here.
[1187.38s -> 1188.98s]  I have to hit two or three home runs right in a row.
[1188.98s -> 1190.18s]  That's one inning down.
[1190.18s -> 1202.96s]  Two to go.
[1202.96s -> 1212.93s]  Both of these or...
[1212.93s -> 1217.25s]  I can do both, right?
[1217.25s -> 1218.80s]  No, I can't.
[1218.80s -> 1226.89s]  It's either both of these or the health boost.
[1226.89s -> 1228.09s]  You don't need the glasses.
[1228.09s -> 1238.64s]  Yeah, I do need this though.
[1238.64s -> 1241.72s]  I could do this and heal, I think, right?
[1241.72s -> 1242.82s]  That will heal you.
[1242.82s -> 1244.45s]  That's true.
[1244.45s -> 1247.31s]  Yep.
[1247.31s -> 1249.01s]  What do you mean, you smoke?
[1249.01s -> 1255.18s]  Hit the pole.
[1255.18s -> 1258.78s]  Fuck off.
[1258.78s -> 1267.81s]  It's over.
[1267.81s -> 1268.88s]  Okay.
[1268.88s -> 1270.38s]  I think I still have a one.
[1270.38s -> 1274.04s]  I can do two outs.
[1274.04s -> 1274.94s]  That was really hard to hit.
[1274.94s -> 1275.94s]  I think I got it.
[1275.94s -> 1276.64s]  All right.
[1276.64s -> 1283.72s]  We're good.
[1283.72s -> 1284.92s]  Three in a row.
[1284.92s -> 1286.65s]  Pull it all the way back.
[1286.65s -> 1287.55s]  Back to 100 health.
[1287.55s -> 1301.58s]  Four in a row.
[1301.58s -> 1309.22s]  Get over.
[1309.22s -> 1310.36s]  Shit.
[1310.36s -> 1315.17s]  Sorry.
[1315.17s -> 1316.76s]  Get up.
[1316.76s -> 1317.66s]  Come on.
[1317.66s -> 1318.76s]  Don't do it like this.
[1318.76s -> 1331.15s]  Audio.
[1331.15s -> 1331.65s]  All right.
[1331.65s -> 1332.65s]  This is very important.
[1332.65s -> 1334.15s]  Another inning in the book.
[1334.15s -> 1348.22s]  One more to go.
[1348.22s -> 1351.00s]  I can do both.
[1351.00s -> 1353.33s]  I could heal, but no.
[1353.33s -> 1354.63s]  I got to do both of these.
[1354.63s -> 1361.05s]  I have to do bat and steroids.
[1361.05s -> 1367.44s]  I don't think I can heal roids and steroids.
[1367.44s -> 1367.94s]  Okay.
[1367.94s -> 1368.24s]  Yep.
[1368.24s -> 1369.48s]  Let's go.
[1369.48s -> 1371.90s]  Psycho mode.
[1371.90s -> 1372.90s]  One more inning.
[1372.90s -> 1381.04s]  I'll turn you to logs.
[1381.04s -> 1382.54s]  God damn it, dude.
[1382.54s -> 1383.34s]  No way.
[1383.34s -> 1386.54s]  You made my cousin into a rock and you sold him at Cracker Bear.
[1386.54s -> 1388.89s]  Super.
[1388.89s -> 1391.42s]  No way.
[1391.42s -> 1392.72s]  That's so hard.
[1392.72s -> 1396.49s]  It's ridiculous.
[1396.49s -> 1396.69s]  All right.
[1396.69s -> 1397.69s]  One more try and that's it.
[1397.69s -> 1398.59s]  And I'll move out too.
[1398.59s -> 1403.47s]  I'll play something else.
[1403.47s -> 1404.37s]  Sorry if I hit you.
[1404.37s -> 1410.74s]  One more try.
[1410.74s -> 1416.00s]  That thing comes in so fast.
[1416.00s -> 1423.54s]  It's out of here.
[1423.54s -> 1428.39s]  What a failure already.
[1428.39s -> 1430.30s]  What's the stream title?
[1430.30s -> 1432.73s]  Adios, baseball.
[1432.73s -> 1434.73s]  Baseball stream 2.0.
[1434.73s -> 1436.53s]  Wallet is a bit tight.
[1436.53s -> 1438.23s]  Wait, what are you talking about?
[1438.23s -> 1440.88s]  Wallet is a bit tight.
[1440.88s -> 1454.97s]  Featuring fishies with that face.
[1454.97s -> 1461.87s]  That's a loon.
[1461.87s -> 1463.10s]  Get up.
[1463.10s -> 1469.53s]  Goodbye baseball.
[1469.53s -> 1475.28s]  That should have hit.
[1475.28s -> 1477.24s]  That's a loon shot.
[1477.24s -> 1478.24s]  All right.
[1478.24s -> 1479.74s]  If the heel pops up, it's happening immediately.
[1479.74s -> 1480.64s]  That's one inning down.
[1480.64s -> 1481.34s]  Two to go.
[1481.34s -> 1487.77s]  That heel is necessary for any run.
[1487.77s -> 1488.47s]  It's not here.
[1488.47s -> 1491.31s]  So I'll take this one then.
[1491.31s -> 1503.88s]  Hope you don't mind if I throw a little harder, kid.
[1503.98s -> 1511.38s]  Adios, baseball.
[1511.38s -> 1513.40s]  Stay fair.
[1513.40s -> 1521.56s]  Home run.
[1521.56s -> 1531.68s]  Three in a row.
[1531.68s -> 1533.48s]  Four in a row.
[1533.48s -> 1534.82s]  Need the heel.
[1534.82s -> 1541.74s]  Charge the mound.
[1541.74s -> 1542.44s]  Count it.
[1542.44s -> 1544.57s]  Five in a row.
[1544.57s -> 1545.97s]  This guy just throws fast.
[1545.97s -> 1546.77s]  The other one has curveballs.
[1546.77s -> 1548.17s]  Another inning in the book.
[1548.17s -> 1553.45s]  One more to go.
[1553.45s -> 1560.45s]  There it is.
[1560.45s -> 1561.05s]  All right.
[1561.05s -> 1562.05s]  Now we're in business.
[1562.05s -> 1564.46s]  Psycho mode activated.
[1564.46s -> 1565.86s]  One last shot.
[1565.86s -> 1571.92s]  I'm going to throw really hard this time.
[1571.92s -> 1575.20s]  That makes six in a row.
[1575.20s -> 1584.87s]  Need to get this health back.
[1584.87s -> 1586.37s]  Those pitches are such bullshit.
[1586.37s -> 1589.46s]  And they go down like that.
[1589.46s -> 1590.06s]  Again.
[1590.06s -> 1597.44s]  Ah, yeah, yeah.
[1597.44s -> 1603.99s]  I got to keep the cursors down.
[1603.99s -> 1604.49s]  Yeah.
[1604.49s -> 1605.79s]  It stayed down.
[1605.79s -> 1618.24s]  I was thinking stay right in the middle so you can have equal place to go anywhere.
[1618.24s -> 1620.46s]  Still sticking with it.
[1620.46s -> 1620.76s]  Yeah.
[1620.76s -> 1621.56s]  No.
[1621.56s -> 1632.85s]  Lower thirds of the strike zone.
[1632.85s -> 1633.25s]  All right.
[1633.25s -> 1634.35s]  Let's go.
[1634.35s -> 1637.08s]  Now that's a dinger.
[1637.08s -> 1638.38s]  How much health do I have?
[1638.38s -> 1639.08s]  Jeez.
[1639.08s -> 1652.86s]  Maybe my x-line was right about me.
[1652.86s -> 1654.56s]  Reduce the speed and bat size.
[1654.56s -> 1664.82s]  How many trees died to make-
[1664.82s -> 1665.12s]  All right.
[1665.12s -> 1665.92s]  I got to focus.
[1665.92s -> 1667.50s]  50 health.
[1667.50s -> 1668.60s]  Play ball.
[1675.66s -> 1683.74s]  Come on, man.
[1683.74s -> 1691.98s]  Home.
[1691.98s -> 1698.94s]  Home.
[1698.94s -> 1702.48s]  That's got enough.
[1702.48s -> 1712.47s]  Three in a row.
[1712.47s -> 1720.18s]  Four in a row.
[1720.18s -> 1723.62s]  That was a weird pitch, but I still got it.
[1723.62s -> 1726.58s]  Nice.
[1726.58s -> 1728.98s]  Does the game account for where you click on the ball?
[1728.98s -> 1731.20s]  Does it change the angle it does?
[1731.20s -> 1738.54s]  So you have to get slightly under the ball.
[1738.54s -> 1739.24s]  All right.
[1739.24s -> 1741.44s]  Slower pitches, I think, is the way to go.
[1741.44s -> 1746.59s]  Because that's 12%.
[1746.59s -> 1748.48s]  Although it might mess me up.
[1748.48s -> 1750.46s]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[1750.46s -> 1767.21s]  This time, we'll make it.
[1767.21s -> 1776.53s]  Home.
[1776.53s -> 1785.29s]  Home.
[1785.29s -> 1794.07s]  Three in a row.
[1794.07s -> 1800.55s]  Over it.
[1800.55s -> 1806.82s]  Goodbye baseball.
[1806.82s -> 1807.22s]  Nice.
[1807.22s -> 1809.18s]  All right.
[1809.18s -> 1809.68s]  Home.
[1809.68s -> 1810.78s]  I've got a good amount of health.
[1810.78s -> 1813.18s]  I've just got to be very, very early to swing.
[1813.18s -> 1814.68s]  Another inning in the book.
[1814.68s -> 1816.72s]  One more to go.
[1816.72s -> 1817.52s]  Are you mad?
[1817.52s -> 1818.12s]  Oh, I'm not.
[1818.12s -> 1824.20s]  I'm just focusing.
[1824.20s -> 1828.51s]  Gravity.
[1828.51s -> 1831.55s]  5% of 30 is more.
[1831.55s -> 1844.78s]  Or should I do, I don't know.
[1844.78s -> 1850.78s]  This is important, too, though.
[1850.78s -> 1854.24s]  Gum or gravity?
[1854.24s -> 1856.70s]  I'll go gum.
[1856.70s -> 1860.04s]  Because if I just have to hit, I just need to-
[1860.04s -> 1861.21s]  I'll heal.
[1861.21s -> 1863.01s]  All right.
[1863.01s -> 1868.96s]  This is very fast.
[1868.96s -> 1872.66s]  Good start.
[1872.66s -> 1887.13s]  What?
[1887.13s -> 1894.31s]  That's a loonshot.
[1894.31s -> 1895.99s]  Oh, ball behind me.
[1895.99s -> 1907.30s]  Way under it.
[1907.30s -> 1913.38s]  It's out of here.
[1913.38s -> 1919.36s]  Grr.
[1919.36s -> 1920.16s]  Fuck you.
[1920.16s -> 1920.96s]  Oh, man.
[1920.96s -> 1924.40s]  That's it.
[1924.40s -> 1924.90s]  I thought that-
[1924.90s -> 1925.88s]  Whatever.
[1925.88s -> 1926.38s]  It's so hard.
[1926.38s -> 1928.79s]  Now you two.
[1928.79s -> 1932.50s]  They made my uncle into a super psycho.
[1932.50s -> 1933.40s]  That was fun.
[1933.40s -> 1934.10s]  That was a good-
[1934.10s -> 1936.10s]  This is hard.
[1936.10s -> 1937.00s]  Is this supposed to be a chill stream?
[1937.00s -> 1937.70s]  It is.
[1937.70s -> 1948.43s]  But I can't say F you.
[1948.43s -> 1950.39s]  It's so fast.
[1950.39s -> 1951.91s]  One more?
[1951.91s -> 1953.42s]  One more.
[1953.42s -> 1959.44s]  I have to beat the tree.
[1959.44s -> 1960.14s]  Hey there.
[1960.14s -> 1961.44s]  Nice to see you again.
[1961.44s -> 1962.64s]  You lost the game?
[1962.64s -> 1963.64s]  What's your refresh rate?
[1963.64s -> 1967.39s]  144?
[1967.39s -> 1972.25s]  Play ball!
[1972.25s -> 1978.52s]  All right, the real stupid thing here is to lose any health against this first two innings.
[1978.52s -> 1980.02s]  You know, right?
[1980.02s -> 1982.22s]  This first inning, you should not lose a single health.
[1982.22s -> 1991.82s]  It's out of here.
[1991.82s -> 1995.57s]  Three in a row.
[1995.57s -> 1996.77s]  My mom just heard you swearing.
[1996.77s -> 2001.71s]  She said, my germa privileges are revoked.
[2001.71s -> 2005.93s]  Four in a row.
[2005.93s -> 2010.89s]  Well, I'll tell you something you can do.
[2012.77s -> 2015.07s]  You got to put something on the table.
[2015.07s -> 2019.66s]  You got to put some type of bargaining chip on the table.
[2019.66s -> 2021.06s]  Oh, like, yeah.
[2021.06s -> 2024.76s]  I mean, I'll clean my room.
[2024.76s -> 2029.20s]  I'll help with some chores around the house.
[2029.20s -> 2033.68s]  You got to put some bargaining chips up.
[2033.68s -> 2038.45s]  I'll help you move furniture, right?
[2038.45s -> 2044.40s]  Be like, I'm sorry that the guy that I watch sucks.
[2044.40s -> 2044.90s]  There it is.
[2044.90s -> 2052.84s]  No, that's not what I want.
[2052.84s -> 2060.95s]  Isn't this just better?
[2060.95s -> 2064.76s]  This is just better.
[2064.76s -> 2065.36s]  Go ahead.
[2065.36s -> 2071.28s]  Call me a one-pitch Andy.
[2071.28s -> 2074.84s]  That makes six in a row.
[2074.84s -> 2075.34s]  Guess what?
[2075.34s -> 2079.04s]  Next time your mother comes in with groceries,
[2079.04s -> 2080.34s]  get off your ass and go help.
[2080.34s -> 2081.34s]  He's on fire.
[2081.34s -> 2085.12s]  That's seven in a row.
[2085.12s -> 2088.87s]  And then, I don't know, maybe it's like, oh, OK.
[2088.87s -> 2093.94s]  Maybe you can get some theater privileges back or whatever.
[2093.94s -> 2097.40s]  Dad?
[2097.40s -> 2100.30s]  Hey, next time your mother shows up with groceries,
[2100.30s -> 2108.81s]  get off your ass and help.
[2108.81s -> 2111.04s]  Yeehaw.
[2111.04s -> 2113.83s]  Thanks, dad.
[2113.83s -> 2115.33s]  Another inning in the book.
[2115.33s -> 2117.06s]  One more to go.
[2117.06s -> 2123.93s]  All right, this has been good so far.
[2124.03s -> 2126.17s]  I got a lot of money.
[2126.17s -> 2133.18s]  Steroids and bat.
[2133.18s -> 2135.63s]  Psycho mode activated.
[2135.63s -> 2136.53s]  Inning three.
[2136.53s -> 2141.21s]  Time to throw even harder, I guess.
[2141.21s -> 2141.71s]  Eleven.
[2141.71s -> 2143.91s]  Holy poggers, there's eleven in a row.
[2143.91s -> 2146.30s]  Did he just say holy pog?
[2146.30s -> 2149.26s]  I'm getting more money with the multiplier.
[2149.26s -> 2153.59s]  I'm getting a lot more money with the multiplier.
[2153.59s -> 2159.43s]  This guy's quick.
[2159.43s -> 2166.06s]  Oh, that was out of the strike zone, whatever.
[2166.06s -> 2173.78s]  Adios, baseball.
[2173.78s -> 2175.08s]  You have to get them in a row.
[2175.08s -> 2177.08s]  That's how you get the money to buy everything.
[2177.08s -> 2182.58s]  Adios, baseball.
[2182.58s -> 2184.68s]  Pray for our heel in between innings here,
[2184.68s -> 2189.51s]  because I need it.
[2189.51s -> 2193.36s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[2193.36s -> 2195.06s]  It's not about winning or losing.
[2195.06s -> 2199.92s]  It's about something else.
[2199.92s -> 2201.06s]  Nice.
[2201.06s -> 2202.96s]  All right, there's the first heel.
[2202.96s -> 2205.06s]  Five percent every time I hit a home run.
[2205.06s -> 2206.96s]  And steroids.
[2206.96s -> 2210.12s]  I can't afford it.
[2210.12s -> 2213.92s]  Should I just hold?
[2213.92s -> 2217.01s]  I'm going to hold.
[2217.01s -> 2217.61s]  I don't know if I want...
[2217.61s -> 2220.88s]  I think I want accuracy.
[2220.88s -> 2223.66s]  I don't think I want the...
[2223.66s -> 2224.06s]  You didn't hold?
[2224.06s -> 2225.36s]  No, I may hold the money.
[2225.36s -> 2234.66s]  I don't think I want...
[2234.66s -> 2235.96s]  Goodbye, baseball.
[2235.96s -> 2241.65s]  I think I want accuracy.
[2241.65s -> 2242.35s]  That's got to be enough.
[2242.35s -> 2243.35s]  Come on.
[2243.35s -> 2245.05s]  I need to heel to full health right here.
[2245.05s -> 2246.15s]  Adios, baseball.
[2246.15s -> 2251.34s]  Five percent of 130 is a lot.
[2251.34s -> 2253.76s]  Get under it.
[2253.76s -> 2257.39s]  Get under it.
[2257.39s -> 2258.79s]  That was like scripted talking.
[2258.79s -> 2261.22s]  Adios, baseball.
[2261.22s -> 2272.57s]  Get under it.
[2272.57s -> 2279.48s]  Adios, baseball.
[2279.48s -> 2280.28s]  Stay fair.
[2280.28s -> 2282.22s]  All right, good.
[2282.22s -> 2284.78s]  Adios, baseball.
[2284.78s -> 2285.98s]  Going to be faster.
[2285.98s -> 2286.58s]  I got a lot of money.
[2286.58s -> 2287.48s]  One inning down.
[2287.48s -> 2293.69s]  Two to go.
[2293.69s -> 2295.32s]  Oh, yeah.
[2295.32s -> 2297.93s]  Oh, man.
[2297.93s -> 2299.43s]  This is a big deal.
[2299.43s -> 2309.31s]  This is huge if I could do this.
[2309.31s -> 2314.56s]  And bubblegum.
[2314.56s -> 2323.31s]  What do you mean you smoke trees?
[2323.31s -> 2330.40s]  Jesus, those are two bad ones in a row.
[2330.40s -> 2332.70s]  So how much am I healing for right now?
[2332.70s -> 2333.40s]  Does everybody pay attention?
[2333.40s -> 2340.14s]  I can't look.
[2340.14s -> 2341.44s]  How much am I healing for?
[2341.44s -> 2342.14s]  A lot?
[2342.14s -> 2342.54s]  13.
[2342.54s -> 2346.03s]  That's awesome.
[2346.03s -> 2347.33s]  Oh, back to fucking full health.
[2347.33s -> 2349.92s]  Let's go.
[2349.92s -> 2351.32s]  Just don't blow it.
[2351.32s -> 2364.30s]  Never mind.
[2364.30s -> 2364.90s]  Oh, my God.
[2364.90s -> 2370.07s]  I'm going to choke.
[2370.07s -> 2376.57s]  Oh, thank God.
[2376.57s -> 2378.70s]  Stay fair.
[2378.70s -> 2379.60s]  I'm all right.
[2379.60s -> 2380.00s]  I'm all right.
[2380.00s -> 2387.54s]  I just made up all the health I just lost.
[2387.64s -> 2388.04s]  Yes.
[2388.04s -> 2388.44s]  Okay.
[2388.44s -> 2392.46s]  Full health.
[2392.46s -> 2393.96s]  Another inning in the book.
[2393.96s -> 2394.56s]  One more to go.
[2394.56s -> 2402.20s]  I have to win this right now.
[2402.20s -> 2406.48s]  Oh, I don't know what to pick.
[2406.48s -> 2408.28s]  All of these are very important.
[2408.28s -> 2415.85s]  I it's probably steroids though.
[2415.85s -> 2419.90s]  I don't have enough for devil three.
[2419.90s -> 2420.50s]  Oh shit.
[2420.50s -> 2421.30s]  I don't have enough.
[2421.30s -> 2421.90s]  I have to do.
[2421.90s -> 2424.80s]  All right.
[2424.80s -> 2425.70s]  I don't I didn't have enough.
[2425.70s -> 2428.29s]  I had 122.
[2428.29s -> 2429.93s]  I'm going to hold this though.
[2429.93s -> 2430.83s]  All right.
[2430.83s -> 2433.43s]  Psycho mode activated.
[2433.43s -> 2438.80s]  Curveball could come, but I would.
[2438.80s -> 2441.27s]  On good start.
[2441.27s -> 2460.41s]  Four in a row.
[2460.41s -> 2465.04s]  Jesus Christ.
[2465.04s -> 2477.92s]  It's so hard.
[2477.92s -> 2481.11s]  Get out.
[2481.11s -> 2487.11s]  It's out of here.
[2487.11s -> 2496.60s]  Shit.
[2496.60s -> 2498.96s]  Get out.
[2498.96s -> 2499.86s]  My hands are sweating.
[2499.86s -> 2514.13s]  Now that's a jinger.
[2514.13s -> 2530.66s]  Oh, that's it.
[2530.66s -> 2532.35s]  I got it.
[2532.35s -> 2534.12s]  All right.
[2534.12s -> 2535.96s]  Now what?
[2535.96s -> 2539.60s]  I am but a tree.
[2539.60s -> 2541.64s]  There's another level after this.
[2541.64s -> 2546.13s]  How many levels are there?
[2546.13s -> 2547.43s]  I don't know what to do.
[2547.43s -> 2556.23s]  Should I boost the HP even more or do power?
[2556.23s -> 2559.73s]  Power I think is what I need.
[2559.73s -> 2565.16s]  I'm going to hold this because I got to buy.
[2565.16s -> 2570.36s]  I have to buy this next time.
[2570.36s -> 2570.96s]  Wake up.
[2570.96s -> 2573.16s]  There are baseball tryouts to go to.
[2573.16s -> 2577.91s]  Harry, he's a little crazy.
[2577.91s -> 2579.71s]  Look at the size of this wall.
[2579.71s -> 2580.61s]  What?
[2580.61s -> 2581.31s]  What just happened?
[2581.31s -> 2586.26s]  The ball didn't even come out of his hand.
[2586.26s -> 2590.82s]  Excuse me.
[2590.82s -> 2609.77s]  Where's the ball?
[2609.77s -> 2610.47s]  Dude.
[2610.47s -> 2618.00s]  By the way, any ladies watching?
[2618.00s -> 2624.05s]  I am single.
[2624.05s -> 2625.35s]  Well, we got to the end of that one.
[2625.35s -> 2628.51s]  That was fun.
[2628.51s -> 2629.91s]  You can't call that a skill issue.
[2629.91s -> 2633.41s]  That was.
[2633.41s -> 2635.41s]  Good luck if you want a super psycho baseball.
[2635.41s -> 2640.22s]  Good luck if you want to play it at level three.
[2640.22s -> 2645.85s]  It's very difficult and good luck.
[2645.85s -> 2647.95s]  Do I have anything else I can start?
[2647.95s -> 2650.53s]  Let me see.
[2650.53s -> 2652.80s]  That's fun.
[2652.80s -> 2657.15s]  What else do I have here?
[2657.15s -> 2660.25s]  I don't know if there's anything I could really do for that much longer.
[2660.25s -> 2663.96s]  Let's see.
[2663.96s -> 2666.26s]  If you're wondering what's happening tomorrow,
[2666.26s -> 2670.96s]  Ster and I are going to play this game called Ember.
[2670.96s -> 2672.16s]  Firefighter game.
[2672.16s -> 2675.96s]  Like a wacky firefighter game, I think.
[2675.96s -> 2677.06s]  I don't know what time we're going to start.
[2677.06s -> 2686.03s]  I'll talk to him tonight and see.
[2686.03s -> 2689.82s]  That game is amazing.
[2689.82s -> 2693.23s]  Yeah, I think I'll probably just call it here.
[2693.23s -> 2699.93s]  I think it's a good time.
[2699.93s -> 2701.53s]  I have a lot of games to play,
[2701.53s -> 2708.13s]  but a lot of them are not like 45-minute experiences.
[2708.13s -> 2716.12s]  Go back and finish the other game.
[2716.12s -> 2720.86s]  When are you going to watch Biodome?
[2720.86s -> 2728.01s]  I don't think I'm going to watch Biodome, man.
[2728.01s -> 2729.51s]  Yeah, that's...
[2729.51s -> 2730.91s]  I'll call it here.
[2730.91s -> 2732.89s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[2732.89s -> 2738.89s]  And then the plan going forward from here is
[2738.89s -> 2746.27s]  Driver 1 is going to be a part of a bigger PlayStation 1 Xbox 360 night.
[2746.27s -> 2750.89s]  There's still probably five games down there on the Reddit shelf
[2750.99s -> 2753.38s]  that I never played.
[2753.38s -> 2754.38s]  They're kind of just sitting down there.
[2754.38s -> 2757.46s]  There's like at least five or six games that I never played down there.
[2757.46s -> 2761.94s]  So definitely going to play them.
[2761.94s -> 2763.34s]  What about the Ace Attorney games?
[2763.34s -> 2768.98s]  I did hear that there's a new Ace Attorney game that released
[2768.98s -> 2771.86s]  and there's no white flashing.
[2771.86s -> 2774.98s]  So, I mean, I could probably play that now.
[2774.98s -> 2779.81s]  Or you can disable white flashing.
[2779.81s -> 2781.51s]  PS1 and 360 are 10 years apart.
[2781.51s -> 2783.32s]  Well, I'm going to have a range.
[2783.32s -> 2785.82s]  I'm going to play Driver 1, a few more PlayStation 1 games,
[2785.82s -> 2787.78s]  a few PlayStation 2 games.
[2787.78s -> 2792.06s]  The rest is some of these stragglers of Xbox and Xbox 360 games
[2792.06s -> 2795.45s]  that we never played from like, I'm talking five years ago.
[2795.45s -> 2796.95s]  Four or five years ago.
[2796.95s -> 2799.66s]  They're here.
[2799.66s -> 2801.06s]  The new trilogy has an option for that.
[2801.06s -> 2804.33s]  Okay.
[2804.33s -> 2809.63s]  Yeah, that's the plan.
[2809.63s -> 2811.03s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[2811.03s -> 2814.33s]  I don't have a time, but I'll make sure the sauce is updated.
[2814.33s -> 2817.22s]  And I'll see you tomorrow.
[2817.22s -> 2817.72s]  Thanks for watching.
[2817.72s -> 2818.95s]  Take care.
[2818.95s -> 2819.65s]  See you soon.
[2819.65s -> 2820.35s]  It's a chill stream.
[2820.35s -> 2822.17s]  We just kind of hang out.
[2822.17s -> 2825.45s]  I do want to do a lot more of these.
[2825.45s -> 2831.97s]  I am very much in the market for doing more just kind of play games
[2831.97s -> 2834.08s]  and hang out streams.
[2834.18s -> 2840.24s]  2023 is going to be the year of just streaming games and hanging out.
[2840.24s -> 2848.25s]  We're going to be kind of going back to the basics here.
[2848.25s -> 2854.87s]  What about Sorcery?
[2854.87s -> 2857.10s]  Yeah.
[2857.10s -> 2865.52s]  I'll fit everything in.
[2865.52s -> 2870.44s]  I definitely do want to incorporate way more streams like this,
[2870.44s -> 2873.14s]  but we can just kind of fuck around and play something.
[2873.14s -> 2875.64s]  It doesn't have to be anything, you know, in particular like,
[2875.64s -> 2876.24s]  oh, it's got to be this.
[2876.24s -> 2876.94s]  It's got to be that.
[2876.94s -> 2877.44s]  It's just like, you know what?
[2877.44s -> 2880.89s]  I'm going to open up Super Psycho Baseball and play for an hour.
[2880.89s -> 2882.59s]  I'm going to play this game for like four hours.
[2882.59s -> 2883.53s]  Whatever.
[2883.53s -> 2888.06s]  That's what I'm going to do.
[2888.06s -> 2894.84s]  Which also, I'll be honest, that means that each stream is...
[2894.84s -> 2899.30s]  I will not be against now, not like I was against it before,
[2899.30s -> 2904.66s]  but actually starting games and playing through them and finishing them.
[2904.66s -> 2907.36s]  I know I abandoned one literally an hour ago.
[2907.36s -> 2912.35s]  But, you know, there are games that have been on this list of,
[2912.35s -> 2914.78s]  I mean, like Paper Mario, for instance.
[2914.78s -> 2919.68s]  It's just like, do I really want to play Paper Mario for like the 20, 30, 40 hours that it...
[2919.68s -> 2921.74s]  Yeah, probably.
[2921.74s -> 2922.44s]  Breath of the Wild.
[2922.44s -> 2922.84s]  Oh, yeah.
[2922.84s -> 2923.44s]  No, I'll go.
[2923.44s -> 2923.94s]  Don't worry.
[2923.94s -> 2929.01s]  I'll go back to it.
[2929.01s -> 2938.22s]  There's a lot of stuff to do.
[2938.22s -> 2939.96s]  Finish Yakuza.
[2939.96s -> 2944.06s]  Honestly, Finish Yakuza has got to a point where it would be restart Yakuza,
[2944.06s -> 2953.19s]  because I have not played it in two to three straight years.
[2953.19s -> 2954.29s]  Is Battle Axe still happening?
[2954.29s -> 2957.54s]  Oh, yes.
[2957.54s -> 2958.64s]  It very much is.
[2965.52s -> 2968.57s]  Alright, I didn't have the music playing.
[2968.57s -> 2969.07s]  Thanks for watching.
[2969.07s -> 2970.89s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[2970.89s -> 2973.04s]  Have a good rest of your night, guys.
[2973.04s -> 2976.01s]  See you tomorrow.
[2976.01s -> 2980.66s]  The game is going to be Ember.
[2980.66s -> 2981.56s]  Take care.
[2981.56s -> 2983.54s]  Call your mother.
[2983.54s -> 2984.04s]  You know.
