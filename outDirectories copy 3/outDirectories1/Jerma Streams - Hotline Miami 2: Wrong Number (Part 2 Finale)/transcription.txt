[1.59s -> 8.62s]  Holy shit, he's early. Yeah, very early. There's a reason for that though.
[9.26s -> 13.05s]  There's always a reason for it, and these are the reasons why.
[15.08s -> 24.76s]  It is 12 p.m. Pacific. I'm awake. I'm kind of back on an incredibly early sleep schedule and
[26.60s -> 33.96s]  I went to the doctor yesterday. I didn't mean to be on this schedule, but I went to the
[33.96s -> 42.25s]  doctor yesterday and had some blood work done, and they took like seven vials of blood,
[43.48s -> 48.36s]  and I was like, well, I'm getting a little fucking lightheaded. I came home and I just fell asleep.
[52.10s -> 59.22s]  I like went right to bed, and I woke up with like 4 30 in the morning. So I mean,
[59.22s -> 71.22s]  come on, we're here, right? Blood talk? I mean, it was in the vial, so you didn't
[71.22s -> 77.56s]  have to touch the blood. You just have to know it was there. So I'm going to go over a few things
[78.36s -> 83.91s]  that are very important, and they include all of you. Well, maybe not all of you,
[84.71s -> 92.28s]  but a large portion of you. So give me a minute. I will be right back and we can get
[92.28s -> 155.06s]  started. Okay, see you in a second. What the fuck are you guys saying? This guy's too early.
[157.88s -> 164.44s]  Yeah, I mean, don't expect streams like this to happen all the time, but I was blood
[164.52s -> 173.38s]  tired last night. I'm not going to be blood tired every day. They took too much of my blood,
[173.38s -> 183.53s]  and then they made me really tired. That sounds really fucked up. But tonight,
[183.53s -> 186.97s]  or today, or today, it's not even tonight. Maybe it's tonight for some of you guys.
[186.97s -> 191.29s]  We're gonna play Hotline Miami 2. I'm going to try to finish it. I have a fresh take on it.
[192.17s -> 198.41s]  It kicked the shit out of me a couple days ago. But I said I was going to persevere,
[198.41s -> 204.89s]  and I was going to try my hardest to beat it. And even if we don't, let's just say I get to
[204.89s -> 211.11s]  a portion of the game where I can't do it, and I'm going to freak out. It's all right,
[211.67s -> 218.41s]  because there's also I got a bunch of community workshop levels as well. I got a little
[218.41s -> 223.93s]  sampling of workshop levels to check out. So if it does get to a point where it's just
[224.25s -> 233.54s]  not completable for me, we'll be good. So let's talk about... No, not yet. Not yet.
[233.54s -> 240.82s]  I'm gonna wait for most people to be here, because it's about Christmas. It's about the
[240.82s -> 249.42s]  Christmas Eve stream that is happening, and it's going to involve you guys. Do it now.
[249.42s -> 255.08s]  All right. You know, fine. Fuck it. We'll do it now. How about we wait? Now do it now.
[256.30s -> 263.26s]  So let's start by saying that there's going to be a live stream on Christmas Eve. That's
[263.26s -> 270.81s]  December 24th. The stream is going to be at some point in the afternoon Pacific,
[271.45s -> 279.24s]  probably like early evening. I'd say around maybe probably like three to four p.m. Pacific
[279.24s -> 284.92s]  time is when it'll probably start. And it's going to be a Christmas slash Halloween
[284.92s -> 291.22s]  extravaganza, because I missed a Halloween stream. I typically like to do Halloween
[291.22s -> 302.63s]  themed streams. So we're going to do both. And at the apex kind of the climax of the night
[303.27s -> 308.47s]  is going to involve you guys doing some stuff. And what does that mean? Well, there's going
[308.47s -> 316.02s]  to be a secret Santa chat gives me presents portion of the stream. Remember how a week or
[316.02s -> 321.54s]  so ago we talked about, man, wouldn't it be funny if chat, I just let them kind of decide what
[321.54s -> 329.70s]  to buy on Amazon? Well, what a perfect time to do that. So there is a channel. There's a channel
[329.70s -> 335.62s]  in the Discord called Secret Santa suggestions. What you're going to do in that channel is
[335.62s -> 347.37s]  you're going to give suggestions of what you would like to give me for Christmas.
[347.37s -> 354.41s]  And from those suggestions, they will be selections. The moderators are going to be
[354.41s -> 359.90s]  selecting. So there's no voting. There's no nominations or anything like that.
[359.90s -> 365.59s]  It's just suggestions the mods are going to be taking from that channel are then I'm going to
[365.59s -> 371.96s]  buy them. But I'm not going to know, because I'm going to have Kim is going to buy them for
[371.96s -> 380.17s]  me. And then she's going to wrap them. And I am going to have no fucking idea what they are.
[380.17s -> 389.38s]  And I'm going to open them on stream. So there are some criteria involved in this,
[389.54s -> 399.54s]  you could probably imagine. No, let's go over them right now. You want me to talk about it. So
[399.54s -> 409.11s]  let's talk about it. They will absolutely, absolutely no living creatures. So oh, that's
[409.11s -> 416.54s]  right. Let's let let's put on the list of 50,000 ants. Oh, no, no, no. Your suggestion has
[416.54s -> 424.09s]  to be under no more than $50. So we're talking zero to $50 is what your suggestion
[424.09s -> 432.30s]  can be. It has to be an Amazon link and it has to be prime ready. So has to be an Amazon link,
[432.30s -> 441.99s]  has to be prime ready, has to be under $50. But the channel, what happened to the channel?
[441.99s -> 461.69s]  Is it not there? The channel is gone. No, it's here. The channel is gone. No, it's here.
[462.97s -> 473.22s]  It should be okay now. So by the way, in that channel, please do not, that's not a chat
[473.22s -> 480.63s]  channel, by the way, not a chat channel, not a chat channel. Wait, no, don't do that. Oh,
[480.63s -> 485.51s]  wait, wait, should I? Wait, okay, but I'm gonna I'm gonna disable those permissions for a second.
[485.51s -> 492.60s]  Let me explain this. Listen. Okay. So everybody just jumped in there and fucking started
[492.60s -> 499.54s]  spamming. Let me explain the rules before you do anything crazy. So in remember, that is not
[499.54s -> 505.46s]  a chat channel. That is a suggestion channel. And you are only allowed three suggestions per
[505.46s -> 512.95s]  person and the bonds are going to be very strict on this. Okay, it's a chat channel. We get it.
[512.95s -> 522.81s]  You know, that channel is a chat channel. Read the spam that got in. Okay. No, no, no, no, no,
[522.81s -> 533.59s]  no, I'm not. I'm not. Because I don't I don't want to give any opinions. I don't want to
[533.59s -> 538.63s]  know what you guys are going to have me buy. And that's that's the thing. I'm going to be
[538.63s -> 547.45s]  opening presents that I'm purchasing, sending to myself, wrapped up from you guys. Because
[547.45s -> 550.57s]  think about that. And people say, well, he's buying his own Christmas presents. What an ego
[550.57s -> 556.07s]  maniac. Am I though? You know, you guys subscribe to this channel, you guys give money to this
[556.07s -> 562.92s]  channel. Be sure that it's not you guys with your suggestion. He's a fucking psycho.
[568.17s -> 574.25s]  What like an ego maniac. That's right. I want to open a present. These are presents to me.
[574.25s -> 579.48s]  But I did mention that I want to do it. And the maximum money is going to be 500 bucks.
[580.12s -> 586.22s]  So there's not going to be a shitload of if you so by the way, knowing that,
[586.22s -> 591.30s]  and the mods are going to have full discretion here. Oh, I have an idea for a present. How
[591.30s -> 599.96s]  about like a $499 vibe? Don't do that. It has to be under 50 bucks. The lower I mean,
[599.96s -> 604.20s]  you could make it a good suggestion if it's higher in price, because that gives you more
[604.20s -> 609.00s]  of a, you know, reason why it would be picked. That'll be a fun idea. And that's just
[609.00s -> 624.22s]  one portion of the stream on Christmas Eve. A $50 fake vibe. Metal Socks just gave 50 bucks
[624.22s -> 631.90s]  right now. Thank you so much, Metal Socks. They say, Hey, Jeremy, I haven't been able to
[631.90s -> 635.82s]  haven't been catching up the streams. Works pushing me hard, but watching the
[635.82s -> 639.50s]  VODs and the second channel stuff really made this whole year for me. I hope you know that
[639.50s -> 646.86s]  I hope you and all have a happy December wean and a happy new yard. Well, thank you,
[646.94s -> 658.20s]  Metal Socks. That's big money. Thank you. Can we donate bits towards a bigger Christmas budget?
[658.92s -> 670.60s]  No, no, no. $500 is it. That's it. No, no bigger Christmas budget. By the way,
[671.24s -> 677.88s]  because of the short notice here, that channel suggestions are only going to be able to be put
[677.88s -> 683.08s]  in that channel until tomorrow, tomorrow evening. You know, essentially like a little
[683.08s -> 689.54s]  bit more than 24 hours from now because I have to get them here. So if you have a suggestion
[689.54s -> 693.22s]  and you got a good one, make sure you get it in there. Make sure it's an Amazon prime
[693.86s -> 699.29s]  link, a link to an Amazon product that is prime shippable. Otherwise I'm not going
[699.29s -> 709.00s]  to be able to get it here in time. Don't tell me, don't give me any ideas. I don't
[709.00s -> 719.24s]  want to see any of these. If you got a good, if you got a good one, get it in there.
[719.24s -> 726.44s]  Why not a bigger budget than $500? Because I don't know, I didn't want to be sitting there
[726.44s -> 730.98s]  opening like 60 Christmas presents. You know how fucked up that would be?
[733.54s -> 739.45s]  Hey, well, Merry Christmas to me. Here's like 75 Christmas presents. That's just like,
[739.45s -> 750.36s]  that's like next level. Can it be eBay? It cannot. It has to be on Amazon. No animals,
[750.36s -> 757.40s]  no live creatures, no parrot. Listen, no perishable food items. If your item is perishable,
[757.40s -> 762.89s]  do not link it in that. It's not going to get used. No sexual shit. I don't even have to say
[762.89s -> 767.75s]  the D word. You know what I'm saying? Like no, none of that. That's not going to get taken.
[776.73s -> 783.24s]  Boring. No, it's called, I don't want to get in fucking trouble. I'm going to be in the
[783.24s -> 788.60s]  studio guys. You want to send me like 20,000 ants and have me open it and be like, oh,
[788.60s -> 800.90s]  and have the ants go all over the fucking studio. I'm going to be fucked. Yes. Oh yeah.
[800.90s -> 814.62s]  That would be real fun. If you have fun with it, don't send me any fucked up shit. What do
[814.62s -> 821.67s]  you mean don't send me? I'm buying these things through the Kim, the proxy, and then she's going
[821.67s -> 829.67s]  to wrap them and I'm not allowed to see them. Do you not trust us mods? No, of course I do.
[833.61s -> 838.81s]  All right. With that being said, let's move on. Hopefully you got enough information there.
[840.95s -> 854.09s]  I don't trust the mods. Thank you KXE for the 30 bucks. Oh shit. EU German stream.
[854.09s -> 859.13s]  Excellent way to celebrate turning 30. Hope you have a Merry Christmas friend. Hashtag charity.
[861.48s -> 868.50s]  Happy 30. That's a big number. That's a big milestone to get over. Thank you for the 30
[868.50s -> 881.29s]  dollars. Now I've been stalling enough because this game beat the absolute shit out of me.
[884.86s -> 892.39s]  I think I've felt, I think I felt worse. Yeah, I'm not sure. I may have like felt worse
[893.11s -> 897.91s]  after being mad at Hotline Miami 2 than I was after seven vials of blood being removed from
[897.91s -> 902.87s]  my body yesterday. I don't know which made me feel more uncomfortable. I don't know. That's a
[902.87s -> 923.83s]  tough one. What song is this? Oh, I'm actually not sure. Buy more blood. Bloodborne gamer? No,
[923.83s -> 929.30s]  not blood. I had, I had a lot of blood work done yesterday. All right, so we're gonna go
[929.30s -> 943.26s]  123456789. Where were we? We were at number 20. Release. I wish I could drink Jerma's blood.
[947.42s -> 954.22s]  I wish you wouldn't. I wish that you wouldn't do that. Why did I read that? All right,
[954.22s -> 961.74s]  I gotta be like calm and collected. I gotta be ready and I'm gonna complete this. I was very,
[961.74s -> 970.09s]  very upset. This music is very loud. I'm gonna, okay, hold on. This is distracting me already.
[974.25s -> 982.41s]  No, that's all right. Okay, here we go. I think I remember, yeah, I remember this part. This guy
[982.41s -> 991.48s]  chases you around. I have, why did I have to start at the very beginning here? All my muscle
[991.48s -> 1000.60s]  memory is gone too. This is gonna be a disaster. This is gonna be a fucking disaster.
[1000.60s -> 1014.39s]  I already know. All right, I got it. We're good. What happened to the, what's with the
[1014.39s -> 1020.55s]  audio? What the heck happened to the audio? All right, now I remember this part. You walk
[1020.55s -> 1027.77s]  through here and I'm gonna die right now because I don't remember. No, I do. Oh, that guy has a
[1027.77s -> 1039.70s]  gun. All right. Oh boy. That's one, two, three, four. Windows everywhere. Does that guy have a
[1039.70s -> 1052.79s]  gun? That guy's got a gun. Two guys with guns. Anybody, who else? That guy, that guy, that guy.
[1052.79s -> 1060.66s]  All right, I gotta watch out. Old god. Why is he not coming after me? Why is that guy not
[1060.66s -> 1072.28s]  coming after me? He just shot me and didn't care. Somebody please come after me. I don't want to go
[1072.28s -> 1087.51s]  in those rooms. It's just death. What the fuck? Why won't he come out here? He did come out here.
[1087.51s -> 1097.40s]  Okay, he came out that time. Is he not, okay, what about this guy in there? I wonder if I
[1097.40s -> 1103.78s]  can hit this door and throw it at this guy. That's what I'm gonna try to do. Okay, I'm
[1103.78s -> 1107.30s]  gonna knock that guy out of the door, throw a crowbar at this guy's face, break that guy's
[1107.30s -> 1109.62s]  neck, shoot him in the face, and then throw the, I don't even know. I don't know what I'm
[1109.62s -> 1121.74s]  gonna do. Perfect. Okay, I did it, but what did I do? Is there anybody else? I think I got that
[1121.74s -> 1131.86s]  guy in there already. Okay. Damn it! I wasn't trying, I was trying to hit that guy. Fuck!
[1132.50s -> 1143.93s]  I was trying to hit the guy with, the guy with the fucking gun. Not this dumb ass. Good,
[1143.93s -> 1149.43s]  come out here. All right, that's the only guy with the gun. These guys have to
[1149.43s -> 1154.47s]  worry about those two. Can I pull them? Whoa. Oh god. That was so many of them. I gotta
[1154.47s -> 1167.61s]  throw this thing down. You know another thing I don't like about this place?
[1168.17s -> 1172.46s]  It's like the lighting. The fact that it gets like that dark and then the red.
[1173.34s -> 1215.16s]  Get over here. Dear lord. Okay, pull this guy out here and go up. Come on, why are you
[1215.16s -> 1232.31s]  not chasing after me? Shouldn't he be running out here? Oh god. Okay, just gonna deal with
[1232.31s -> 1239.69s]  this guy and then I get a gun and we can do it again. All right, here we go. Don't fuck
[1239.69s -> 1245.03s]  it up. Come on Jeremy, don't fuck this up. Wait, somebody has a gun. Somebody has a gun.
[1245.03s -> 1257.96s]  Give me that gun. What? He doesn't hear that? There's a guy with a pistol. There he is.
[1260.23s -> 1266.62s]  Okay, here we go. He can shoot me through the walls but so can I. Bingo. Give me the new
[1266.62s -> 1280.15s]  gun. Nobody else, right? I'm so paranoid. You know, it would be nice. Why did that take so
[1280.15s -> 1302.60s]  long? Okay, no gun. Gun, gun, gun. One guy left. That's it. Please, please have this be the last
[1302.60s -> 1307.51s]  guy on this floor. I can't see all the way up there though. I think it is. I'm going for it.
[1308.15s -> 1312.54s]  Holy shit, I just got so scared. I thought there was a guy right there but it was a
[1312.54s -> 1341.38s]  fucking plant. Okay, here we go. Got it. He's back baby. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
[1347.26s -> 1360.38s]  This is so sloppy. I got to get this fucking gun out of here, man. Oh yeah, yeah.
[1370.84s -> 1383.53s]  Fuck. No, well, I wanted to shoot you. I'm so confused here. Am I like picking up the gun
[1383.53s -> 1390.49s]  without right clicking? Hold on a second. I'm really confused. I'm running over this gun
[1390.49s -> 1400.94s]  and it's picking up. Like, I'm not hitting right click. Am I out of my mind? Oh boy,
[1400.94s -> 1418.47s]  all right. What do we got? Fuck. Okay, I think I was going to... Got it. Okay,
[1418.47s -> 1429.30s]  now wait for this one guy. Give me this gun, please. That one, I think. Who's left? All
[1429.30s -> 1442.87s]  right, we got a ton of people down there. Gun. Got it. Anybody else? Gun. Got it. Oh my
[1442.87s -> 1446.63s]  god, there's a people in there. Fuck, I forgot about the people in that room. God damn
[1446.63s -> 1463.29s]  it. Oh my god, there's some people in there. What the hell was that? And I told myself today,
[1463.29s -> 1468.33s]  listen guys, I said I was going to be fucking calm. I wasn't going to freak out. I was going
[1468.33s -> 1480.90s]  to be very, very careful. I'm okay. I got this. Everything's fine. I said I was going to be
[1480.90s -> 1484.58s]  cautious. I was not going to freak out. I was going to be very, very collected today.
[1485.14s -> 1493.37s]  I think so far I've been okay. You know what I'm saying? What do you guys think? I've
[1493.37s -> 1500.38s]  been pretty calm and collected. Tons of... Oh, I didn't want to shoot. I just accidentally
[1500.38s -> 1504.36s]  shot that guy. All right, give me another gun. I don't have... There's no other guns here.
[1506.36s -> 1515.91s]  Sir, could you... There's another gun. All right. Right, what's happening? What's that?
[1518.33s -> 1522.73s]  What? I don't understand why I don't... Jeremy, don't do it. But I don't understand
[1522.73s -> 1528.79s]  why. I don't understand. I don't understand why it was locked on and I couldn't get the
[1528.79s -> 1534.07s]  lock on to come back. I don't... I don't understand. I'm infuriated right now. Stop it.
[1534.07s -> 1536.79s]  It's all right. Everything's going to be fine. Just pick up the gun on the ground.
[1537.35s -> 1540.07s]  Don't worry about it. Just think about it. It's like Christmas time. You know what
[1540.07s -> 1550.06s]  I mean? Like, isn't that nice? Christmas is fucking nice. The holidays are here.
[1551.38s -> 1568.98s]  You know? I didn't get more than one... He's dead? All right. There's people down
[1568.98s -> 1574.02s]  there and that door is open. So I got to get in here. I got to shoot one guy.
[1574.74s -> 1588.87s]  That guy got a gun? I just fucking panicked. What the hell are you doing, Jeremy? What have
[1588.87s -> 1602.12s]  I done? It's ruined. No, it's not. I got a gun right here. Fucking door. All right.
[1602.12s -> 1605.00s]  It's just this guy with this pistol. I'm going to go down here. I'm safe.
[1606.87s -> 1622.12s]  That's it. Okay. Just wait for... That guy's dead in that room. Okay. One bullet. No,
[1622.12s -> 1633.43s]  it's too risky. Uh, give me something else. It's too risky. Told you it was risky.
[1633.43s -> 1639.93s]  See? Nobody else is alive. Come on. I was told this is like the hardest level in the
[1639.93s -> 1667.56s]  game. That's what my horoscope said this morning. That's it. Oh, I almost died. Okay.
[1668.12s -> 1681.10s]  Get changed. This level is where I quit for six months. Six months. That's a long time.
[1681.90s -> 1693.50s]  Who the hell is this guy? Is this guy Duck? What? I... I don't understand this guy. He
[1693.50s -> 1704.90s]  Ducked. Does he... What? What am I supposed to do about this guy? I guess just avoid him?
[1705.46s -> 1715.13s]  Okay. What do I do about the Duck guy? There's a bunch of Duck guys.
[1715.13s -> 1732.01s]  Melee? Huh. Well, there's a melee here. Let's see if this theory works.
[1734.02s -> 1742.26s]  Ooh. All right. So they... I can't shoot these guys. Oh my god, he's running so fast.
[1742.98s -> 1754.04s]  Oh, I didn't know they... Holy fuck. I like how... I need to like crack my fingers for a
[1754.04s -> 1766.41s]  second. They like hurt my chest. I could... Come on. Get over here. He doesn't see me?
[1766.41s -> 1779.77s]  This guy's gonna see me. Give me a gun. What the fuck? What just happened?
[1779.77s -> 1798.10s]  I went through every single window. It didn't hit anybody. Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh
[1798.10s -> 1802.18s]  my god. What do I do? I need a melee weapon. I need a melee weapon. I need a melee weapon.
[1802.18s -> 1816.68s]  Knife. Knife. Punch. What happened? Okay. We're fine. No more guns? I think this guy
[1816.68s -> 1823.10s]  just has a... My guy just has a bayonet. See through, but it's okay. Just pull this guy out.
[1825.48s -> 1830.20s]  That guy can see through here. Oh! Okay, we're fine. There's another guy there.
[1831.00s -> 1853.10s]  How do I get rid of this guy? Oh, like this. Got it. God. What? I was... What am I even
[1853.10s -> 1865.53s]  saying? I'm trying... It's not over. There's more to do. Oh. Cafeteria or something? No
[1865.53s -> 1881.90s]  guns. Why use the shotgun when I can just go like this? I didn't get the combo. That's
[1881.90s -> 1887.82s]  all right. Whatever. Pull this guy. All right. There's another big guy. Get the gun.
[1896.12s -> 1905.35s]  Okay. Big guy. I mean like, whoa, you got big guy. All right. We got a psycho though. I got
[1905.35s -> 1912.62s]  a... All right. This is the plan. Shoot. Grab melee. Hit guy. Or shoot, throw, punch. Right?
[1913.26s -> 1929.24s]  What do I do? Did he come? Is he over here? He has a gun? I thought that... No. I thought
[1929.24s -> 1937.13s]  that was one of those... Oh, what? I thought that was one of those crazy guys that...
[1940.36s -> 1949.61s]  Fucking hell. Oh, that made... Like why... Why are you doing that when you have a gun?
[1950.33s -> 1955.56s]  Is there a reason for that? That made me extremely upset. I'm upset right now.
[1956.36s -> 1960.12s]  You're just going to sit there and pound on his face and you just have a shotgun in your
[1960.12s -> 1990.82s]  pocket. No, I didn't have any bullets. Taking the gun with me. That guy's got a gun. Just pull
[1990.82s -> 2004.25s]  him if I can. Actually, shoot him. All right. Let's try this again. I need that one shot here
[2004.25s -> 2015.59s]  for him. All right. This guy has a gun. Oh, fuck. What am I going to do about that? Okay.
[2016.31s -> 2029.88s]  Well, I have to kill this guy. Fuck. Okay. I gotta run in there. No, I don't. Huh. Okay.
[2030.44s -> 2037.24s]  All right. I have to throw a knife at somebody's head. All right. Here we go. Knife this guy
[2037.24s -> 2042.63s]  right in the face. No, knife this guy right in the face. Wait, there's a pistol? Pistol?
[2043.27s -> 2051.32s]  Does it have bullets? Did I... Oh, there it is. You know, what would I do without you guys?
[2051.32s -> 2057.02s]  What would I do without you guys? What the hell would I even do without you?
[2058.55s -> 2066.34s]  What? I'm pan... What happened? What? That's not a door. What? Why did this not open? What?
[2066.34s -> 2075.86s]  What? What? Why did the door not... I walked right into it. I don't understand. What the
[2075.86s -> 2082.87s]  fuck did I just do? No, no, no, no, no. What? What the fuck did I just do? Did I just go back?
[2083.59s -> 2094.14s]  I just press... No fucking way. You gotta be kidding me. Really? That that just actually
[2094.14s -> 2098.17s]  happened? When you're in the middle of a level, you just... It's that easy to go all
[2098.17s -> 2116.78s]  the way to the beginning? No way. You gotta be fucking kidding me. What? No, no. Not even
[2116.78s -> 2120.30s]  like a confirmation, right? What? It's just like, now you're at the beginning again.
[2121.16s -> 2129.54s]  What? I'm so fucking mad right now. I can't believe it. That was like on floor three or four.
[2129.54s -> 2142.28s]  If I was on the first floor, I would understand, but why? There's no way to
[2142.28s -> 2162.82s]  undo that. And why did the music get so quiet? Yeah, I guess I just accidentally
[2162.82s -> 2171.27s]  restarted the entire thing. Now I gotta do this all over again. What the fuck?
[2177.24s -> 2194.63s]  Okay. Well, I think I'm so upset by that that I like, I don't even know what to do.
[2195.59s -> 2201.35s]  I'm going to do it again, but I'm, I'm so like annoyed by what just happened that I can't even
[2201.35s -> 2205.91s]  give you a reaction and I'm just going to play. Let's go. Base cam. All right. Fine.
[2222.55s -> 2227.67s]  End of the stream voice. Somebody wrote, I would quit for six months over that.
[2229.34s -> 2233.34s]  No, I, but I'm, I'm all right though. I've, I figured these levels out before
[2234.06s -> 2239.85s]  as a list. Go ahead and just don't get so upset that you can't just have no emotion right now.
[2239.85s -> 2253.56s]  This guy with gun, what else is over here? Give me another weapon. I gotta be ready for
[2253.56s -> 2257.16s]  this. I'm going to pull people into the bathroom. I didn't even know there was a way
[2257.16s -> 2262.84s]  to go in there. Oh, come on. I didn't even know there was a way to go down there.
[2262.84s -> 2267.64s]  Why did it rewind? No, it's coming out. Why did it rewind all the way without a confirmation?
[2268.66s -> 2271.30s]  What's what's what's with the cotton? No, no confirmation.
[2284.41s -> 2290.20s]  I can't believe it. I can't fucking believe it. Oh, no, I can't just relax.
[2290.84s -> 2305.99s]  I didn't even know they could go through there. Get in here. You
[2310.65s -> 2325.27s]  did this. Stop it. Just do it. Just I can't fucking, why would that even be an option?
[2346.06s -> 2360.95s]  I'm so fucking mad. I need to relax, man. I seriously need to relax. I'm gonna like
[2360.95s -> 2366.79s]  eat my microphone. But I'm, I might not sound that upset, but deep down and inside of like
[2366.79s -> 2375.29s]  my fucking veins, this is like when the evil villain is so dangerous and so terrifying and
[2375.29s -> 2383.13s]  somebody makes fun of him or slights him and he doesn't look upset. He's very collected and
[2383.13s -> 2389.05s]  he's just sitting there like, Oh, yes. Isn't that an interesting thing you said? And he's
[2389.05s -> 2393.45s]  so collected about it. But deep down, you know, you know that what he's he's planning.
[2394.09s -> 2403.19s]  He's planning to eat his microphone when he goes home. That guy doesn't have a gun.
[2403.19s -> 2412.01s]  I don't want him to see me. All right. Let's I gotta run up on this guy and get him.
[2412.01s -> 2418.22s]  Run up on him and get him. I can write. I know I can give me that gun. All right.
[2419.02s -> 2426.82s]  It's time to guns. No, I'm not going to do this yet. Yes, I am. I already did it.
[2434.20s -> 2440.06s]  Got it. Okay. I got it with one shot. Thank you. It's that easy. We're fine. Oh,
[2440.06s -> 2446.28s]  fuck. That's still going. Right. I'm, I still have to do this whole thing again, too.
[2458.55s -> 2463.10s]  I think that like when I, when I know that I, I'm just like fucking angry
[2463.82s -> 2469.19s]  and it's making me play at a level that I've never even seen before. Okay.
[2469.19s -> 2475.86s]  So we're good. Two guys up there with a gun. Anybody down there? I don't think there is.
[2477.54s -> 2480.82s]  Nope. Gun, gun. Let's go ahead and pull.
[2487.11s -> 2507.54s]  Of course that guy's still alive. Give me a break. That guy hit himself in the
[2507.54s -> 2513.45s]  fucking head with the door. I don't, I don't like the shotgun.
[2514.09s -> 2519.35s]  I seriously don't like the shotgun at all. It just causes fucking problems.
[2528.58s -> 2547.93s]  All right. Give me. Got them both. Yes. That guy can probably see me. Does that have,
[2547.93s -> 2551.99s]  that guy have line of sight on me? All right. Only guy with the gun right here.
[2556.22s -> 2567.50s]  Oh boy. Right. Give me this one. Very close to being exactly where we were and
[2567.50s -> 2576.81s]  deleted a bunch of fucking time for no reason. Wiser rewind. Give me that.
[2576.81s -> 2585.38s]  All right. These guys both have, that guy has a gun. That guy up there has a gun. Did I get
[2585.38s -> 2591.14s]  the guy over here? It was two, right? This guy in the bathroom. All right. I'm going to say
[2591.14s -> 2597.80s]  I'm going bathroom. Oh my fucking God. What have I done? I saw the guy behind me.
[2599.51s -> 2641.86s]  Oh my fucking God. I can't, I don't, I did it already. Oh, that's it up there. Okay. Give me
[2641.86s -> 2653.62s]  the pistol. No, fuck the pistol. Explain it. I want a full written report of what happened
[2653.62s -> 2663.75s]  there. All right. Now we got these two. Didn't hear that. I guess. Fine. You fucking can't be
[2663.75s -> 2687.56s]  serious. Oh my fucking God. I can't fucking believe it. Just give me a weapon. Any of
[2687.56s -> 2702.07s]  them that had bullets. Is he dead? Did the door hit him or is he dead? I don't know.
[2702.07s -> 2711.58s]  I think he's dead. The guy with the gun right here. I'm trying to fucking shoot the guy behind
[2711.58s -> 2718.04s]  him. What the, why? He knocked him down and he, I still shot him with the shotgun
[2718.04s -> 2728.02s]  and he absorbed every single fucking pellet. Just never forget, never forget that I did,
[2728.10s -> 2768.89s]  I pressed enter on this and almost did it again. Press R to reload. Can I pick, please? Anything,
[2768.89s -> 2774.84s]  please? Can you just go back to pick a chapter? No, it starts at the very beginning.
[2786.58s -> 2799.66s]  Damn it. These guys, that guy has a gun. What the fuck was that? All right. I need
[2799.66s -> 2803.78s]  something here. All right. This time I can't let that happen again. I got to get back to
[2803.78s -> 2814.81s]  where I just was. I don't think these, any of these have, no, no bullets at all.
[2814.81s -> 2824.30s]  I'm in trouble. I guess I could throw, nobody has a gun over here. Yeah,
[2824.30s -> 2843.70s]  they do. Shit. I have to pull this guy in here. Give me your gun. Okay. Can we please try this
[2843.70s -> 2858.97s]  again? Without like a total disaster. All right. How did I even get shot by that guy?
[2858.97s -> 2866.52s]  This guy was, what the heck happened? All right. This crunch time here. Get it done.
[2866.52s -> 2872.73s]  For the love of God. That, kill that guy last. Because there's two, there's a pistol
[2872.73s -> 2877.93s]  on the ground there. He's done, nobody has line of sight. All right. Here we go.
[2878.49s -> 2886.60s]  I got to make this happen. What the fuck is you doing over here? What are you doing over here?
[2886.60s -> 2899.56s]  What do you think you're doing over here? What are you doing over here?
[2901.70s -> 2910.90s]  All right. Finally. Don't press escape ever again. My heart is racing right now. No,
[2910.90s -> 2914.66s]  I already did this too, didn't I? Did I already, where's my fucking character? What the
[2914.66s -> 2939.54s]  fuck? What? All right. But by the way, when I press R, why doesn't R go now? Who's left? Oh boy. Oh
[2939.54s -> 2949.32s]  boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. When there's somebody up here, I got like collapsed on by somebody before
[2949.32s -> 2962.01s]  this guy. I need a melee. That's it, right? Somebody else ran after me before. I remember
[2962.01s -> 2970.98s]  distinctly. Fuck. Somebody came after me with, I need to get a melee. Give me a reliable
[2970.98s -> 2989.66s]  melee. I don't even know who's down there. Nobody has a gun. That guy. I knew I saw,
[2989.66s -> 2998.07s]  I knew he was coming. This guy has a gun. Nobody in this room. Just this guy here. Come on.
[2998.07s -> 3010.36s]  You can see me. Get over here. How do you not see me? Jesus, man. Don't go in there.
[3011.16s -> 3022.50s]  Don't go in there. Just wait. Fuck. Come on. I don't, I don't want to go in there yet.
[3024.07s -> 3042.79s]  Oh, he almost did it. He almost did it to me. Last guy. Now we're back. Kill them. I know.
[3042.79s -> 3055.14s]  I'm trying. It's just very nerve wracking. This is where I was before it. No. Actually,
[3055.14s -> 3064.58s]  I kind of like that strategy. That you stupid door. It has to be the same color as everything
[3064.58s -> 3086.87s]  else. I liked that strategy before it was a fucking terrible strategy. Fucking guy.
[3088.46s -> 3099.90s]  I thought it was a fat guy. Fucking God again. Where's the fucking sprint guy?
[3107.78s -> 3110.98s]  I right clicked three times to try to pick that up and it didn't pick it up until like
[3110.98s -> 3127.18s]  the fourth one. Why? I seriously, he just fucking like instant teleported around the corner.
[3127.18s -> 3150.41s]  I need that gun. The fuck. All right. Can you not like fucking hit box me from five feet away?
[3151.13s -> 3163.91s]  Same thing up here. Where's the guy? He's right up here somewhere, right?
[3166.28s -> 3182.54s]  Jesus game. Come on. All right. We got one, two, a guy with a gun. I'm going to melee over
[3182.54s -> 3187.80s]  here. Is this a toothbrush? Bring this gun a little closer because I know for a fact I'm
[3187.80s -> 3195.83s]  going to fuck it up and need it. What the hell? What the hell? Where's the gun? Oh, what happened
[3195.83s -> 3210.86s]  to the gun? I threw it up here. I'm going to shoot this guy from over here. There's a guy.
[3210.86s -> 3219.99s]  Is that guy alive to the right? I think he is. Is he? He's not moving. Is this guy alive
[3219.99s -> 3241.75s]  right here? He is. It's one of these idiots. Okay, gun. Fucking bird noise. All right. I
[3241.75s -> 3245.67s]  got to be very careful here. This too, this too much can go wrong. Don't do it yet.
[3253.06s -> 3273.96s]  Okay. Got it. Last guy. This guy has a gun. Yet. Escape. No, it's not over.
[3277.30s -> 3280.18s]  Don't have a guy. I don't have a guy come over to me. It killed me.
[3281.67s -> 3284.87s]  Oh, okay. We've got this. We're evacuating. Go get yourself out of here.
[3289.34s -> 3300.14s]  I'm just kidding. I'm not going to press fucking reset. Oh boy. Hey, I still got it.
[3301.19s -> 3310.74s]  I might have failed that level though. It depends. Not even a confirmation.
[3311.38s -> 3322.86s]  What do you think? D? That's all right. C-. I got a better score because I rewound.
[3323.42s -> 3330.95s]  After that, well, there's not a whole lot more to tell. If I may ask, where did you go after
[3330.95s -> 3336.86s]  you escaped? I guess I might as well tell you. I went to Hawaii. You see, that's why I need
[3337.42s -> 3340.78s]  you to get me a plane ticket. By the way, those of you guys that are watching,
[3342.06s -> 3346.86s]  this is like 80% of the way through the game. This is not like Hotline Miami 2 part 1.
[3347.59s -> 3351.51s]  We played this a couple of days ago. I'm just finishing it up. I'm going to play it until it's
[3351.51s -> 3361.34s]  done. And there you go. Spoiler if you've never seen the game. This is not level 1. You see,
[3361.34s -> 3365.90s]  that's why I need you to get me a plane ticket. It's not for me. It's for my mother. I'm
[3365.90s -> 3370.63s]  really worried about her. She can't take care of herself. I was hoping you could get her
[3370.63s -> 3376.14s]  to come here. I understand I'm going to have to check my bank account. I'll get the money
[3376.14s -> 3382.47s]  for it one way or another, okay? Wouldn't be right otherwise. I don't think you understand
[3382.55s -> 3389.78s]  how much of a help you've been. By the way, those of you that are just joining us now,
[3389.78s -> 3393.22s]  I want to make sure I make this very clear. We talked about it. Let's talk about it for like
[3393.22s -> 3399.64s]  a couple minutes right now. Christmas Eve is going to be a stream. And you, yes,
[3399.64s -> 3405.94s]  you are going to be involved if you want. There's a channel on the Discord right now
[3405.94s -> 3410.50s]  that is designed for you to give suggestions of what you'd like to buy me for Christmas.
[3411.30s -> 3414.26s]  And it's going to be secret. I'm not going to know what they are. It's going to be
[3414.26s -> 3418.34s]  secretly purchased. You don't have to buy anything. Yeah, I'm going to buy it
[3419.54s -> 3423.46s]  through a proxy. So I will not know what it is. And they're going to be wrapped and I'm
[3423.46s -> 3431.46s]  going to open them on stream on Christmas Eve. That is what's happening. Your suggestions have
[3431.46s -> 3437.94s]  to be an Amazon link and they have to be prime shippable. Otherwise I will not be able
[3437.94s -> 3444.82s]  to get them in time. Has to be Amazon. Has to be prime shippable. Shippable. Shippable.
[3444.82s -> 3456.50s]  There's too many P's in that word. And your suggestions have to be between zero and fifty
[3456.50s -> 3464.81s]  dollars. No more than that. Maximum budget that's allowed is fifty bucks. And the mods are going
[3464.81s -> 3470.15s]  to take this from the suggestions and I come up with a Christmas list and that's one of
[3470.15s -> 3480.28s]  the things we're going to be doing on Christmas Eve. Zero dollars. Dear Evan, I haven't heard
[3480.28s -> 3484.68s]  from you in a while. I miss you. The kids miss you too. I think we can still make this work
[3484.76s -> 3489.24s]  but I can't live with a man who puts his job before his family. I still love you. You know
[3489.24s -> 3497.98s]  I do. I hope you love me too. Please call me when you read this. Sharon. 49.99 or
[3497.98s -> 3509.18s]  fifty dollars. Like fifty. Five zero dot space zero zero zero. Why are there multiple
[3509.18s -> 3526.02s]  things to look at here? Hold on. Wait what? Act six catastrophe. Did I just go am I
[3526.02s -> 3532.98s]  writing a story right now? You wanted to see me boss. Yeah we've got things to do tonight.
[3534.42s -> 3541.66s]  Like what? You know the strip club on 77th? It's opening up tomorrow. So? The Colombians
[3541.66s -> 3547.83s]  they own the place. They're having an opening party tonight. VIPs only. Let you find out.
[3547.83s -> 3553.48s]  How do you think they invited me? Bring your guns. We're going to make sure they have a
[3553.48s -> 3558.28s]  fun party. You want to start a war with the Colombians. Is that really a good idea?
[3558.44s -> 3563.53s]  Got a lot more people than we do. After my father died they went in and stole our territory. Our
[3563.53s -> 3567.37s]  business. You think I'm just gonna let that slide. This is really a good time for it.
[3567.37s -> 3571.82s]  This is not going to be a better time while we wait. They keep expanding. Now who's the
[3571.82s -> 3576.23s]  boss here? You or me? You got any more objections? You're the boss. They'll do
[3576.23s -> 3588.25s]  whatever you tell me. Alright then let's go. So now I play as this guy. You guys know that
[3588.25s -> 3593.38s]  machine that you punch and it tells you like how many pounds per square inch your punches are?
[3593.38s -> 3600.17s]  I can get that thing over like seven or eight hundred. I can almost get that thing.
[3600.17s -> 3608.87s]  I can almost max that thing out at nine nine nine nine nine. Stop changing characters. I have no
[3608.87s -> 3616.68s]  control over it. Yeah okay sure. I'll prove it. Next time I'm available and I'm in front of one
[3616.68s -> 3619.64s]  of those things I'm going to I'm going to hit that thing over a hundred pounds per square
[3619.64s -> 3624.79s]  inch. I impress people all the time. They go holy shit man. Well you go like it's my turn.
[3624.79s -> 3630.06s]  They're like like 620 and I'm like oh wow that was pretty good. You know another guy
[3630.06s -> 3635.50s]  goes up like oh wow the 540. That's a lot dude. That's a fucking shit load. Good for you.
[3635.50s -> 3640.42s]  Somebody else comes up and like spins around runs across the room sprinting and then they punch as
[3640.42s -> 3646.06s]  hard as they can. Like seven seven hundred and then the whole place fucking screams and I just
[3646.06s -> 3651.37s]  like crack my neck a little bit. I'm like um let me try. I'll try. It sounds like fun.
[3651.37s -> 3653.69s]  I get up there and I fucking destroy this thing and the thing goes like
[3654.65s -> 3661.66s]  and then people just their jaws drop because I do about 800 fucking per pound per square
[3661.66s -> 3669.50s]  inch punch. I know I can do it and I'm just letting them all have like their moment
[3669.50s -> 3674.94s]  with their like 600 pounds per square inch punches and I let them have it and I'm like yeah yeah and
[3674.94s -> 3688.92s]  then I get up there and I'm telling you this is real. I'll do it. You want to see like how
[3688.92s -> 3695.03s]  ferocious of a person I am. The next time one of those is around I'm going to have somebody
[3695.03s -> 3704.65s]  videotape me doing it. 21st scene. This is called the screw. What was it called? I didn't
[3704.65s -> 3717.38s]  I saw it for one second. Roll dodge. That's all I have. Oh seizure. Okay I can't pick
[3717.38s -> 3727.02s]  anything else. I don't want to dodge roll. All right let's go. I didn't why did I not hit that
[3727.02s -> 3742.95s]  guy for? Oh okay all right all right all right. Pretty good line of sight on me right here. Come
[3742.95s -> 3755.67s]  on. Windows. I didn't know those are windows. I didn't see them. So we got to pull this guy
[3755.67s -> 3774.76s]  through here. God it's so dark. Come on. Where are you? We go. Here comes two other guys. All
[3774.76s -> 3783.91s]  right. Pistol right there. This is a problem. Let's see if I can pull them. All right.
[3783.91s -> 3796.07s]  All right. That guy's just dancing over there. I need to light up again so I can see. Turn it
[3796.07s -> 3804.94s]  up. All right. All right. You get you get one piece of pez. Let's go with this. I can't tell
[3804.94s -> 3813.50s]  it was anybody else. There's a guy right here. Well where'd he go? Where did that guy go?
[3815.48s -> 3822.30s]  God damn it. All right. Well I'm just gonna go in here and shoot these guys I guess. All
[3822.30s -> 3834.22s]  right. I don't know. I can't. That guy's a window. That's it up here. I'm just gonna
[3834.22s -> 3841.93s]  keep going. What the fuck? That patrol took so long for him to get down here.
[3841.93s -> 3866.62s]  Where the hell was that guy? All right. Again we've got these two guys. Got a knife. Pull
[3866.62s -> 3882.04s]  them over here. Why are you like this? What? Am I missing something here? Am I
[3882.04s -> 3893.26s]  missing something here? Is he like up? Who the hell is this guy? Why can I not? Okay.
[3893.26s -> 3938.44s]  That was weird. That patrol didn't get him. Shit. Last guy. There he is. What? What? Where?
[3938.44s -> 3978.60s]  What? What killed me? There's a guy in a bush. Why am I fucking not surprised? All right. I
[3978.60s -> 3989.82s]  gotta shoot this guy. I just took the guy's head off. All right. Again I can't see anything
[3989.82s -> 3997.03s]  on the ground. I guess there's a gun here. All right. Watch out for guy in the bush.
[3997.59s -> 4010.09s]  That's great. I love everything about that. Fucking asshole. All right. Let's go. I have
[4010.09s -> 4036.79s]  a choice apparently. I can't go that way. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. He came out this time. Well. Well.
[4036.79s -> 4054.54s]  Okay. I'm gonna miss somebody and I'm not gonna even see them. I guarantee that. Someone's
[4054.54s -> 4074.84s]  gonna be like hiding in a sofa and they're gonna shoot me. The dog. Don't let me forget
[4074.84s -> 4090.22s]  about the dog. I will forget about that fucking dog. Is he still alive? What? Huh? Huh? Huh?
[4090.22s -> 4101.58s]  Why am I? Stop doing that. Huh? Why am I making that fucking noise? Relax. Dog. Dog.
[4102.46s -> 4111.90s]  Who's left? I don't know. Maybe the one with 20. All right. We got guy with a shotgun. I'm
[4111.90s -> 4120.81s]  gonna keep this guy locked on because I know I'm gonna fuck this up. Told you. I just
[4120.81s -> 4128.12s]  didn't even look. I hope I got somebody. What is the fucking door in the way?
[4137.03s -> 4156.95s]  Who is left? I'm so paranoid. Right here. Last guy? Yep. Okay. I guess I'm gonna go over here.
[4164.81s -> 4178.55s]  Well. That was it. Apparently. Go to the car. But what about over here? I want to go up
[4178.55s -> 4184.17s]  that way. Is it the same? No. It's the same thing. No. Just different entrance. Okay. Well.
[4187.48s -> 4199.29s]  That wasn't hard enough for you. No. That was okay. That was fine. That was like a nice level.
[4199.85s -> 4227.13s]  It was challenging. Dark. Nice. Always a C. All right. Somebody tell me. I'm unlocking
[4231.35s -> 4236.25s]  items that I'm... I thought that was a fucking like... I thought that was a monster and those
[4236.25s -> 4239.21s]  were eyes for a second. I was like who's in like a different costume? I thought it was like
[4239.21s -> 4242.97s]  a weird like bear costume. Whatever. Let's just not pay attention to it.
[4245.88s -> 4251.50s]  Ugh. We sure did a number on those bastards, huh? Call us for a celebration, don't you think?
[4252.14s -> 4256.60s]  I don't know, boss. That's what that is. It's not... there's no nudity here.
[4257.16s -> 4263.50s]  That's those people in costumes. Those are just like eyes and that's like a head and they have
[4263.50s -> 4268.86s]  like hats on. You know how I make like 40% of every rumble character in the new 2k games?
[4269.94s -> 4274.42s]  That's... that's what it is. I don't know, boss. You don't know what the hell is that
[4274.42s -> 4282.41s]  supposed to mean. I think I'm gonna head back home. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
[4282.41s -> 4290.73s]  And why is that? You've got all you need right here, don't you? I gotta get home to my girlfriend.
[4290.73s -> 4297.83s]  Been a long day, you know? You guys see that fucking shark? Yeah, it's a pretty big shark.
[4297.83s -> 4302.39s]  Boy, that girl sure did a number on you, huh? You know, a real man doesn't need to rely
[4302.39s -> 4306.79s]  on women to live his life. The minute you get attached to anyone, you know you're fucked.
[4306.79s -> 4311.27s]  Besides, that girl of yours is way too good for you. One day she will come to her senses,
[4311.27s -> 4316.89s]  you know. Well, that's none of my business. Go on home if that's what you want.
[4321.98s -> 4327.56s]  All right, see you soon. Oh, before you go, I left a little something for you on the desk outside.
[4327.56s -> 4342.15s]  Buy your girl something nice. I can't, like, smash this? What is it? Oh, nice. Money! Thanks
[4342.15s -> 4362.01s]  for the money. Oh, I can't go in the cool car? I let the door open? It's all right. All right,
[4362.01s -> 4366.36s]  boys, this is it. Tonight we'll be rich. We can do anything we want. The Colombians will
[4366.36s -> 4371.32s]  have nothing left. They'll learn to fear us. Toast to our new lives as kings of the street.
[4371.88s -> 4400.46s]  This kind of sounds like a cool Bowser theme song from Mario and Luigi RPG games. Don't die
[4400.46s -> 4414.26s]  on the third floor. All right, I'll try not to. Am I supposed to be getting attacked here?
[4414.82s -> 4427.93s]  If only we could hear it. You can hear it. Uh, guys? Oh, what an end. What an end to the
[4427.93s -> 4442.60s]  arc. Oh, there's guys right there. Let's see if we can spring something together here.
[4443.16s -> 4463.22s]  Turn the mouse sensitivity down. It's fucking me up. Need a new weapon.
[4465.85s -> 4479.67s]  Ooh, boy. Come on up. Pistol, please. All right, this somebody, this people down here.
[4480.39s -> 4487.50s]  I'm gonna get lit up by this guy. No, okay. They don't have line of sight here?
[4489.37s -> 4492.73s]  No, just I'm checking to make sure they don't have, you know, pull them. What's the point
[4492.73s -> 4500.54s]  of that? How do they miss? Just this guy. What about down here? Nobody. Okay, got ya.
[4512.68s -> 4541.38s]  Pistol. I would like that. Fuck. I don't know. Knew it. Okay, we're good. Straight up.
[4543.48s -> 4553.77s]  Okay, we've got, ooh, I didn't mean to do that. Well, okay. I feel like I have to stand here.
[4557.50s -> 4565.34s]  Sensitivity, please. All right, let me think about this. So, this guy's gonna get up.
[4566.14s -> 4572.41s]  And then, nobody. There's a, watch out for the walls. I got a guy here.
[4573.37s -> 4578.73s]  Why ya, why we? Oh, okay. Whatever. Who has sight on me? Somebody all the way up there?
[4581.58s -> 4591.53s]  Okay, I get it. Okay, get you. Get you. Watch everybody come around the corner.
[4592.65s -> 4607.35s]  That leaves you. You. And somebody else, I guess. You two. I need to make sure that none of you
[4607.35s -> 4622.12s]  people up here are going to kill me like you. One, two, three. That it? Nope. Couple of guys
[4622.12s -> 4629.14s]  left. Although, I want this gun. It's more reliable for me. What do we got? See if I
[4629.14s -> 4634.34s]  can get them both. Nope. I should still be able to get you though. Oh, no, I didn't. I got
[4634.34s -> 4644.70s]  him. I got him. Is it safe? That's the question. I don't think, I think it's just this guy.
[4644.70s -> 4650.47s]  Nobody else in this room. No hidden people. No bush. Almost guy in a bush. He was, he was
[4650.47s -> 4660.20s]  turning into a bush guy. I got him before he transformed. Do it before he gets up!
[4660.76s -> 4680.25s]  All right, we're good. Is that it? Oh, no. There. That should disable all the security
[4680.25s -> 4686.97s]  doors. I heard about this guy, the Joker. Yeah, he's crazy. You hear how weird he is?
[4686.97s -> 4708.06s]  Yes, I have heard about how weird he is. Whoops. I can't. What the fuck? The Joker
[4708.06s -> 4711.18s]  misses at the beginning of the movie. Don't worry. You've never seen, I've never seen
[4711.18s -> 4721.43s]  Star Wars before. This, yo, it's fine. You'll be fine. How are you still living? How are
[4721.43s -> 4762.95s]  you still among the living? You got shot. Oi! I don't know. I have a gun in my hand.
[4762.95s -> 4768.63s]  Oh, you put the gun down when you do that. All right, let's see who's up here.
[4769.59s -> 4784.01s]  You. Dead. Dead. Dead. Anybody else? Ah, place to hide. Good vantage point. Guy with the gun.
[4784.73s -> 4793.02s]  We got fat guy. I need another gun. I need that. Give it to me.
[4795.08s -> 4810.34s]  Ah, you. Be right back. Oh shit. Okay, I'm fine. Why was I even locked on? Made no sense.
[4814.71s -> 4816.95s]  Ha, now I'm not locked on and it was a problem.
[4818.31s -> 4823.80s]  All right, that's it. Just the two guys in there. Shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[4823.80s -> 4834.74s]  It will be though. Of course it will be. And hey ho ho. Got it. Okay. All right,
[4834.74s -> 4850.65s]  just slurp it up. Did you say I'm high as fuck? Father, what are you doing here?
[4853.62s -> 4870.36s]  I'm not here. You know that. Yes, I know. Then why are you here? I don't know. I want
[4870.36s -> 4876.28s]  to make you proud. Such things don't matter. I can see you haven't changed. You're just like
[4876.28s -> 4884.44s]  me. You won't get in it until it's already too late. You know, it's me the chicken. Your
[4884.44s -> 4889.40s]  father is right. You don't get it, do you? Not that it matters anymore. It's all the same in
[4889.40s -> 4895.54s]  the end. And there's nothing wrong. There's nothing you can do about that, is there?
[4897.42s -> 4917.94s]  Goddamn. But father. We already told you, Dutch. He's not here anymore. In fact, neither are you.
[4917.94s -> 4931.82s]  That was a B for effort. A C- for effort. My face came on. Let me turn it off. Thanks
[4931.82s -> 4947.27s]  for reminding me. Uh, you are style unlocked. Blood? What was it? What? Why is it already
[4947.27s -> 4965.54s]  laughing? It's already laughing at me. Blood tired. I am still a little blood tired. I don't
[4965.54s -> 4968.90s]  know about you guys, but when I get blood taken, it takes me like three or four days
[4968.90s -> 4975.88s]  to completely recover from it. I just feel my life force draining and it just, it throws me off
[4975.88s -> 4984.95s]  for almost a week. It took six, seven vials. What do we have here? And I had to breathe into
[4984.95s -> 4993.77s]  a bag. They were testing to see if I have, um, Healabacta pylori, which is like a bad
[4993.77s -> 4999.91s]  stomach and intestinal bacteria. That's a whole ordeal, but everything's fine. Don't worry.
[5002.68s -> 5009.13s]  Uh, what do we have here, Johnson? That's not real. They were just fucking with you. What?
[5010.81s -> 5016.18s]  H. pylori is like a bacteria. I looked it up. What do we have here? Looks like your
[5016.18s -> 5029.29s]  perp's been at it again. This one got quite the treatment. How much for a vial of my blood?
[5029.29s -> 5033.29s]  You're not getting any of my blood. This is one got quite the treatment. He left another
[5033.29s -> 5037.13s]  message. You have to stop them. I don't want to take any more innocent lives. Whoever did
[5037.13s -> 5043.88s]  this must be completely out of their mind. He's a whack job, all right? This city seems
[5043.88s -> 5048.65s]  to be full of them. Did he leave any clues behind? The chief's going to be on my ass
[5048.65s -> 5055.99s]  with all the press with this will get a shell casing and a couple of prints.
[5055.99s -> 5062.63s]  No, you know, you know why I would never give somebody my blood because that's everything.
[5064.04s -> 5067.80s]  Like you're talking about everything. Oh, you're concerned that your passwords are in
[5067.80s -> 5074.18s]  there. Your DNA is in there. Your entire genetic makeup is in that vial. Everything
[5074.18s -> 5079.75s]  about you that ever will be and ever was. I don't want you guys to know what my fucking
[5079.99s -> 5088.92s]  body passwords are. Are you serious? A shell casing and a couple of prints is going to be
[5088.92s -> 5095.67s]  hard to see if they match the victim given the state he's in. Might find more when we do
[5095.67s -> 5100.30s]  a more thorough inspection of the place. Well, I hope you do find something. Not to put any
[5100.30s -> 5105.27s]  pressure on you guys, but my job's on the line on this one. We'll do our best. All right,
[5105.27s -> 5109.82s]  don't think I'll be much use here. I'm pretty beat. I'm heading home to catch some sleep.
[5109.82s -> 5116.97s]  Let me know what you find tomorrow. We'll do sir. I don't know. I don't know what my blood
[5116.97s -> 5144.63s]  type is. I have no idea. Four? I don't know. I don't know. Brute force his blood. No,
[5144.63s -> 5151.61s]  sooner or later. I don't want anyone to have that because sooner or later in 500 years,
[5151.61s -> 5156.25s]  you'll be able to like read people's thoughts with their DNA and shit. You'll be able to like
[5156.25s -> 5161.05s]  recreate somebody's brain and look up like, like in their brain catalog, everything they've
[5161.05s -> 5168.06s]  ever done or said or anything they ever spoke of. You're going to be able to pour my blood
[5168.06s -> 5171.50s]  into like a machine and go through my back catalog and find out last time I shit my
[5171.50s -> 5190.31s]  pants. I don't want you to be able to do that ever in a thousand years. Time for bed. Why would
[5190.31s -> 5198.94s]  you care if it's a thousand years? Because I can't, I don't know. I don't want, I can't find it.
[5204.38s -> 5216.30s]  Thunder and lightning. I can't find it. What am I looking for? You'll be able to take that
[5216.30s -> 5222.39s]  blood DNA brain thing and you'll be able to just go watch a video recording of me,
[5222.39s -> 5235.03s]  like a POV of me eating a booger when I was 11. That's scary. No, we got a huge amount
[5235.03s -> 5238.31s]  of community subs here. Furt, thank you Furt. Fernandez for the 10 community subs.
[5244.20s -> 5256.09s]  Thank you so much for 10 community subs coming in right now. Am I missing something here?
[5265.22s -> 5276.07s]  Looking for this. For Smash. You know, Convert. You know, Convert for Smash.
[5277.03s -> 5282.12s]  What are you doing here? This is a crime scene. Well, you know what they say.
[5282.76s -> 5290.60s]  Twitterers always return to the scene of the crime. I guess there must be some truth to that,
[5290.60s -> 5298.33s]  huh? Right, who are you? You don't recognize me? We're related by blood, aren't we?
[5299.90s -> 5306.36s]  Think of me as your son. You created me after all. Give me back my gun, creep. You want it,
[5306.36s -> 5329.19s]  huh? How about a hug instead? What? Did I drop a TV on his head? There you are, hop on in.
[5329.27s -> 5342.30s]  Your next scene is up. So step on it. Is there a reason why we took the dog van from Dumb and
[5342.30s -> 5359.61s]  Dumber? Okay, um, your next scene is up. What just happened? What did I just do? What?
[5360.25s -> 5369.05s]  So this hotline Miami is just a movie? Is that what this is?
[5369.77s -> 5390.55s]  Oh, I need that gun. Speaking of guns. I got stuck. I got stuck. I got stuck. Speaking of
[5390.55s -> 5404.57s]  guns. Give me that one. Holy fuck. Got the gun over here. Anybody else in this room? Oh yeah,
[5404.57s -> 5422.60s]  there is. What is this guy? What is that guy? I don't know yet. He left it. I'll deal with
[5422.60s -> 5430.04s]  him in a minute. I don't know. I had the glass. He was, ah, I had that so clean too.
[5430.92s -> 5446.71s]  That really was clean. Glass windows. Every fucking, every fucking level has to have a
[5446.71s -> 5467.13s]  glass window. Everywhere. No, always a mistake. Never hit space on anybody for any reason.
[5467.13s -> 5470.33s]  What's the reason for it? It just takes extra time. You just get extra points.
[5470.89s -> 5475.37s]  I'm just a C minus fucking streamer. Why do I care about like the extra 200 points?
[5476.17s -> 5482.94s]  2000 points. Rewind. What are you talking about? Why would I rewind? Why would I do that?
[5483.50s -> 5492.50s]  No, I'm not going to rewind. I missed a cut scene. If I rewind, where is it going to
[5492.50s -> 5498.10s]  put me? I broke the game. Why did I break the game? What? I better not regret this.
[5508.82s -> 5520.46s]  I went all the way. How did I get it to work? I have no idea. What was I? Was I delirious?
[5520.46s -> 5527.74s]  What were we talking about? DNA? Detective Pardo, you're a disgrace. I've never heard
[5527.74s -> 5531.26s]  of anything like this before. Normally, I never offer any kindness to a person such
[5531.26s -> 5535.42s]  as yourself, but since you are a police officer, I will now give you a choice.
[5535.42s -> 5539.26s]  Turn yourself in and confess to your crimes. Maybe they'll go easy on you.
[5539.26s -> 5543.18s]  If you don't, I have several officers waiting outside to arrest you.
[5543.98s -> 5548.12s]  Sir, I'm not sure what you're talking about here. What is it you think I've done?
[5549.34s -> 5553.10s]  Think I have a pile of evidence here against you. Ballistics report, fingerprints,
[5553.10s -> 5560.47s]  witness statements. To think a police officer would be the Miami mutilator. You make me sick.
[5561.11s -> 5564.63s]  Now hand me your badge. I'll have one of our officers take your confession.
[5565.43s -> 5568.39s]  Sir, there must have been some mistake. Someone must have set me up.
[5569.51s -> 5573.59s]  I'll prove it to you if you just let me go, okay? You're going nowhere, Pardo.
[5574.15s -> 5579.19s]  Don't make this any harder than it already is. Sorry, sir. You'll have to take me by force.
[5579.19s -> 5588.63s]  Well, I did really miss a lot, didn't I? I just walked on the movie set and then started
[5588.63s -> 5613.10s]  punching people. That doesn't work on dogs. All right, all right. That's it. Keep it going.
[5613.82s -> 5629.03s]  Pistol. Oh, oh, oh, why? I'm actually upset by that. I'm actually pissed off. What am I doing?
[5642.42s -> 5650.09s]  I want this gun. That one. That one. I want this one. Okay, so we've got
[5651.46s -> 5670.17s]  gun. No gun. Gun, gun, gun. Watch out for that gun. I didn't even get the guy. Oh,
[5670.25s -> 5692.04s]  fucking that's called panicking. All right. Hydrate. I'm very hydrated. Yeah, I've got a
[5693.37s -> 5702.89s]  water here. I'm good. What about the guy in here? No, that guy would have just killed me
[5702.89s -> 5718.42s]  if he had a gun. I was prepared for it. You know, I was very prepared. Oh,
[5723.45s -> 5733.69s]  grab the shotgun. Oh, yeah. Here it comes. This is where I get. I had it and it was so
[5733.69s -> 5744.31s]  clean and I did it. I did that. I had that. So I got all nice shot, shot, shot, shot.
[5748.68s -> 5758.52s]  We call this bullshit. This is called bullshit. By the way, nobody in the world,
[5758.52s -> 5764.52s]  nobody on earth. Let's go over like offices. Okay. This makes sense. Nobody has a window
[5764.52s -> 5770.15s]  to another like coworkers office like this. This window doesn't do anything. Nobody has
[5770.15s -> 5781.72s]  a window like this. This is called whining. Nobody has a window here. And who built these?
[5782.52s -> 5790.31s]  The window should be here to the outside. I've seen something like that before, actually.
[5791.54s -> 5806.73s]  Wait, I won. I won. I'm not whining. Am I? Is this whining? This guy with the taser.
[5806.73s -> 5832.01s]  I'm about to start fucking whining. Okay. Got him. Die. I had it. What am I doing?
[5832.74s -> 5842.62s]  Just shoot him. I mean, why do I have to be paranoid of 15 people with guns? Fine,
[5842.62s -> 5861.61s]  I'll do the strategy and it would have worked. Just shoot him. What the fuck was that? Dude.
[5873.27s -> 5875.75s]  You know, I wanted to pick up the same weapon twice. That'd be wonderful.
[5880.31s -> 5893.05s]  Got it. Okay. Geez. Any more windows? Gun. What the fuck? Whoa.
[5893.05s -> 5901.24s]  Oh, fucking office windows. Why do they have? God damn it. What the fuck?
[5902.44s -> 5918.89s]  What the hell? It's so unnecessary. He's terrible at 80% of every game he plays.
[5919.61s -> 5928.28s]  Give me a break. Please. What? This shit is fucking hard as shit.
[5932.18s -> 5938.02s]  People have quit this game. Like not played for six months. You saw the chat room. People
[5938.02s -> 5954.38s]  went away from this game for six months. I'm still here. One guy said that. Yeah,
[5954.38s -> 5964.52s]  and that's fine because the game is fucking hard. I read a post on Twitter where a guy said he
[5964.52s -> 5984.50s]  couldn't even beat the first room. All right. Come on. I got a C on these levels. Did I
[5984.50s -> 6005.88s]  get that guy too? That worked. That worked. Now, I went to Twitter. There was a guy that
[6005.88s -> 6010.55s]  was like, hey, I can't beat the first room. Can somebody help? What do you think the
[6010.55s -> 6040.36s]  responses were? Idiot. Fucking this stupid door. Hey, you want to know what all the responses were?
[6041.61s -> 6052.81s]  Idiot. And then he finally beat the second floor. And he went out back on Twitter and he said,
[6052.81s -> 6056.33s]  hey guys, I beat the second floor. I'm really trying. It's a tough game.
[6057.37s -> 6071.30s]  Idiot. And this is how you make me making this story up. So? You don't think this
[6071.30s -> 6088.04s]  happened at one point? Somebody said this. Give me one pellet on this guy. Come on. Nobody
[6088.04s -> 6098.38s]  else is up here, right? Get good. Most people get good. Oh, I've got some news for you. I've got
[6098.38s -> 6104.60s]  news for you. Go open up the achievements of this game on Steam. How many people have gotten past
[6104.60s -> 6119.05s]  the first level? It's not even going to be fucking 30%. I can't answer that. How many
[6119.05s -> 6124.81s]  people beat the cleric beast? It's like 40. You're one of 40 people that did that. You
[6124.81s -> 6143.27s]  should be proud of yourself. Put your hands behind your head. Get down on the ground.
[6148.47s -> 6168.07s]  29% of people have the beat the game achievement. So, yeah. What the heck? That's less than a third
[6168.07s -> 6179.58s]  of all people that have played this game on Steam. Stop flaming me. Stop flaming me.
[6184.76s -> 6190.04s]  Two out of thirds of bad? No, it's not. Come on. You can't look at it like that.
[6191.77s -> 6199.64s]  If 70% of everybody doesn't beat the game, does that mean that 70% of people aren't good
[6199.64s -> 6205.64s]  gamers? I mean, probably. You're probably right. Don't shoot. I'm a detective. Here's my badge.
[6208.39s -> 6213.37s]  I said get down on the ground. This is your last warning. Let me through. I'm a police.
[6214.57s -> 6228.07s]  I don't get losing for that, right? You'd be surprised if you go look at achievements
[6228.07s -> 6247.37s]  and trophies. This is Pardo speaking. Cough. They're casuals. Are they though? What if they
[6247.37s -> 6253.67s]  just aren't good at it? It's okay. That's okay if you're not good at it.
[6253.75s -> 6265.75s]  We need you down at the station. I don't feel too good. I'm gonna have to take the day off.
[6265.75s -> 6298.33s]  This isn't really the time. You're not a pro gamer. T? C-? I've never failed a level.
[6298.97s -> 6320.92s]  Hey, you there. I'm here to see your boss. Bring him out for me, will you? You don't have
[6320.92s -> 6326.78s]  an appointment, do you? Besides, the boss isn't in. Oh, yeah? Well, his car is right
[6326.78s -> 6335.77s]  outside. Boss has many cars. Was there anything else? Playing that game, huh? My back suit
[6335.77s -> 6341.96s]  won't be telling that, okay? Time, guys. After today, we'll be in the big league again.
[6341.96s -> 6347.72s]  Just remember the plan and don't be late. If you are, we're toast. All right, I'm going
[6347.72s -> 6372.02s]  in. Wish me luck. What? I don't get it. Takeover is the last 24th scene. Killing
[6372.02s -> 6384.02s]  punches, no weapons, bloodline, firepower. What is firepower? I guess we'll find out.
[6384.50s -> 6406.33s]  Uh, okay. Oh, this must be T-pose, I remember. Oh, that didn't work. Maybe it will.
[6409.30s -> 6436.38s]  Fuck, come on. Oh, who's left? Watch it. But where are you gonna come from? Over here,
[6436.38s -> 6442.90s]  I see you. Almost out of bullets. I gotta get this last guy right here through the glass.
[6444.50s -> 6450.46s]  Okay, who's left? That's a big gun right here, isn't it? No, it's not. Those are the
[6450.46s -> 6461.42s]  guns I just had. I was just wearing those. All right, that's fine. Let's go. This is all
[6461.42s -> 6467.08s]  cleared down here. Window, though. Watch out for the window. Watch out for the window.
[6467.80s -> 6476.12s]  I panicked, but it's okay. I need that gun. Uh, this guy right here, I should get side on
[6476.12s -> 6480.28s]  him right there. Nope. I'll try it again. I got it. Okay. What about you right here?
[6481.24s -> 6503.82s]  Got it. What? What's going on? Uh, is there a reason for that? One guy over there with
[6503.82s -> 6507.26s]  a gun. Everybody else has melee. I don't think, unless I miss somebody over here.
[6508.98s -> 6519.37s]  Yep, I did. What do I have to do with you? What do I do with you? What the fuck? No. What? I
[6521.29s -> 6529.77s]  tried to punch him. He has so much reach. Holy shit. I mean, I knew it was the duck guy,
[6529.77s -> 6541.75s]  but he has like some insane reach. You can't punch him. Okay. So I need a melee weapon?
[6542.47s -> 6550.10s]  Because I could punch the other. I could punch the other guy that was running. That was melee
[6550.10s -> 6571.13s]  only. Apparently not this dude. How's that guy doing? Oh fuck! I ran out of bullets right at
[6571.13s -> 6597.03s]  the end. 64 bullets remaining in that. I say that like that's not very much. Same deal. All
[6597.03s -> 6609.45s]  right, where's the melee weapon? Right here, down around you. Let's wait. All right, then you
[6609.45s -> 6623.19s]  and you. Little dog. Yep. Give me a melee weapon. No, I could probably get you too.
[6624.73s -> 6636.42s]  No, I can't. Whatever. I think I need a gun. I believe I, yeah, I need to kill these dudes
[6636.42s -> 6657.03s]  here. One more guy up there, I think. Maybe not. Can I pull him out? Can I like throw
[6658.20s -> 6665.51s]  a knife over there? Over that? Or let hit it? I'm not sure. Once I shoot this guy,
[6665.51s -> 6685.30s]  though, he's gonna run out. Is he out? No, he's not out. Okay, now melee weapon. Let's go.
[6686.10s -> 6699.54s]  Pull him out. Let's go. Got it. Okay. Over there. I didn't check over this way though. I
[6699.54s -> 6707.67s]  got everybody over here, didn't I? That's where I started, isn't it? Okay, let's wrap around
[6707.67s -> 6716.42s]  here again. No other dogs. No random stray people. Okay, I just want to check. I think
[6716.42s -> 6722.17s]  there might be another guy over here. I didn't mean to click my fucking thumb.
[6727.37s -> 6748.41s]  Ah, holy shit. Okay. So we got one guy left, I think, right here. That's it.
[6749.21s -> 6784.06s]  Nobody's standing. Nobody in a bush, right? I'm not gonna get pushed. He's above me. Wow.
[6784.06s -> 6820.57s]  What? Oh, he came from the top. Oops. I knew he was coming. Shit. He's coming. Oh, he's
[6820.57s -> 6824.73s]  coming. He's coming. He's coming to get me. He's coming to get me. The guy with the melee
[6824.73s -> 6846.97s]  is on his way. Oh, fuck. Okay, relax. What else is there? I need a gun. That'll do it.
[6847.77s -> 6853.24s]  Windows. Anybody above? I think this room is safe. Yeah, this room is safe except
[6853.24s -> 6889.90s]  the windows. Wait, what? Did I knock it through? I just used them on 10. I knew
[6889.90s -> 6894.46s]  somebody else was gonna come over there. I knew it. And I fucking freaked out.
[6897.83s -> 6906.44s]  Good. All right. Now. Oh, what? There's a window there. They can shoot through here.
[6907.86s -> 6918.54s]  Ay, yi, yi. You go through one, two, three, four rooms with this window. There's no other way
[6918.54s -> 6926.31s]  you can get over there. Any windows up top? There are windows right there. All right. I gotta
[6926.31s -> 6959.18s]  go up. Hold on. All right. Fuck. What? This like across the map. You can't see anybody.
[6964.09s -> 6984.76s]  Fucking hell. I'm just gonna sit here. Out of bullets. Somebody's coming. Which way are
[6984.76s -> 7007.30s]  they coming though? Are they coming this way? Who else? Anybody else down the whole hallway?
[7007.30s -> 7014.44s]  I gotta go this way anyways, bud. Yeah, he saw me. He's coming. That's the guy with the
[7014.44s -> 7039.18s]  fucking this thing. Shotgun. I'm gonna get collapsed on. I know it. I'm so paranoid.
[7039.18s -> 7048.98s]  Someone's gonna fucking come all the way down here. All right. Safe. What's this? I can't
[7048.98s -> 7068.50s]  pick it up. Dog. I have to snipe them over here. I gotta try because this is gonna be
[7069.46s -> 7079.54s]  something else here. I gotta pick off at least a couple of people. Dog. There's gonna be a
[7079.54s -> 7102.65s]  dog coming. Just wait. You sure? He's coming though. Where's he going? I don't know where
[7102.65s -> 7128.31s]  he's going but I'm gonna wait. Excuse me? Did I fall off the map? Did I walk backwards too far?
[7128.87s -> 7140.92s]  Is that what happened? Fuck it. No, you can't do it like that unless you memorize the entire
[7140.92s -> 7143.72s]  level. You have to, I have to memorize the whole level to play it like that.
[7144.44s -> 7148.97s]  All right. Here's the dog. Wait till he goes across the entire map. The whole thing.
[7149.77s -> 7175.45s]  I can't believe it. There's probably another dog coming. All right. I got a bunch. Who the fuck
[7175.45s -> 7181.05s]  are you? What are you doing on the stairs? Why are you in the very beginning on the stairs
[7181.05s -> 7185.77s]  out of my line of sight holding shift the whole way up? What the fuck?
[7188.01s -> 7239.94s]  All right. Here he comes. Got it. I gotta piss so bad. No other dogs. Dog. Somebody.
[7239.94s -> 7246.63s]  Is somebody here? Somebody's here. Okay. I gotta sit here for a second because I just
[7246.63s -> 7267.26s]  may have alerted like at least two. Oh my lord. Okay. Did I get him? Nope. Just wait.
[7267.82s -> 7282.92s]  We'll make it over here eventually. He'll find it. Thanks for the new gun. Now it's
[7282.92s -> 7290.78s]  a question of shooting through here. Where the fuck? Holy shit. There's an entrance there.
[7291.58s -> 7296.82s]  Move out of the way. All right. Anybody. Somebody. I gotta hide it over here.
[7296.82s -> 7301.30s]  Just hide here. No. Where? I got a safe room. This one's safe. Right? No, it's not. Yes,
[7301.30s -> 7313.08s]  it is. There's only two other people in that other room. I think I'm good. I'm gonna go
[7313.08s -> 7329.98s]  down. If I see a dog, I swear to you. I'm so ready for a dog. Where is the dog?
[7333.67s -> 7341.66s]  Look at how far away you are. I'm so fucking paranoid right now. Any other guns up here?
[7341.66s -> 7351.82s]  This one. Did I get him? I'm gonna go for it. Whatever. Guy on the stairs. Right? Nope.
[7352.54s -> 7361.42s]  Is it? Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I need to. Okay. There's a machete right here.
[7363.22s -> 7370.89s]  Give me the machete. Oh, you idiot. You fucking idiot. Is it safe to get that?
[7375.64s -> 7393.08s]  One guy right here. Holy fuck. He almost just got me. Last guy. Right? Nope. That guy
[7393.08s -> 7404.01s]  would have killed me. Alright. So looks like I gotta go down. Last dude right here. No windows
[7404.01s -> 7416.47s]  for him to shoot me. Nobody else. Just him. I know I freaked out right there, but you gotta
[7416.47s -> 7464.20s]  do what you gotta do. Alright. Another one. This way. Fuck. Damn it. Alright. Wrap around.
[7465.00s -> 7472.81s]  Let's do it again here. Give me the shotgun. So I gotta take this guy out
[7473.53s -> 7489.58s]  cleanly. He's all the way at the end and then shotgun blast once. I, whatever. Three shots.
[7489.58s -> 7502.25s]  Who's up there? Okay. It's safe. No, it's not. I can't go over there. Dog. Dog. Big guy.
[7503.13s -> 7539.72s]  This room is safe. I need a better gun than this. Windows. No, I gotta be. Dog. Nope.
[7539.72s -> 7563.24s]  Can go. Just gonna make sure no one's right. Okay. There's another dog. Watch it. Watch it.
[7564.20s -> 7575.78s]  That's not gonna make anybody sprint over here. We sure about that? Give me the other gun. These
[7575.78s -> 7579.78s]  dogs are freaking out. Are they trying to come get me? I think they trying to get me,
[7579.78s -> 7584.84s]  but I don't know. I gotta go. I gotta take those. Okay. There's a melee only guy right here.
[7584.84s -> 7591.82s]  I gotta get this guy now. Okay. So give me a melee weapon. I'm gonna go pull that guy out.
[7592.46s -> 7605.11s]  Come on. Come on down here. Alright. I think that's it for that. I need a gun back.
[7605.91s -> 7616.26s]  They're coming for me. Are they? I have to kill them right now. I gotta go
[7616.26s -> 7620.42s]  up down here and I gotta shoot. Alright. That's my plan. Watch out for that guy.
[7621.30s -> 7641.85s]  Those dogs are coming after me. I don't know. I hate not being able to see over there.
[7643.45s -> 7649.32s]  Dogs are coming over here now. No, they're not. It's not safe standing there.
[7649.88s -> 7661.77s]  One dude and then it's safe and I can collect guns. That guy. Is that a melee only guy?
[7661.77s -> 7676.57s]  No, just a just a guy. I'm just like losing it. I'm freaking out right now because I'm
[7676.57s -> 7684.17s]  terrified of something behind me. Okay, done. New gun. I can go down.
[7685.05s -> 7692.07s]  There's only one two remaining. I have to go from this room. No windows.
[7692.07s -> 7705.18s]  I just have to shoot. There's a door. Don't fuck it up. I fucked it up. I
[7705.18s -> 7714.07s]  fucked it up bad. I fucked it up real bad. Okay. Wait, that's not it?
[7716.15s -> 7733.06s]  Where? Okay, that is it. Is it? I see the arrow. Okay, it is. This game is gonna give me diarrhea.
[7733.06s -> 7740.42s]  It really is. Fuck, there's even more. No, is this it? Alright, this is the end. I'm just
[7740.42s -> 7745.24s]  gonna get rid of everybody in this room. Is there any special gun I can pick up in here?
[7745.96s -> 7759.38s]  I don't think there's anything else. I'm dropping the gun on the ground.
[7759.38s -> 7765.62s]  You got some balls coming in here alone, but this is as far as you go. That's how you greet your
[7765.62s -> 7771.06s]  guests, is it? You can drop the AK now. Face it, you're already dead. And why are you still
[7771.06s -> 7777.37s]  talking to me? Got him. I'll give you 10 seconds to surrender. Maybe I'll let you live.
[7778.01s -> 7791.62s]  You're out of your mind. Uh oh. One, two, three, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[7793.70s -> 7800.28s]  Hey, how does it feel? How do you like it? I've been playing like that the whole game.
[7800.28s -> 7815.34s]  Do you have a problem with that one? I give you... Alright, fine. That's okay.
[7823.14s -> 7836.66s]  Sick. Why don't you swing on by and check it out? Anyone there? Click. Wait, those jelly beans?
[7837.22s -> 7842.60s]  Come on, those are drugs. Okay, hey boss, take it easy on those pills. You shouldn't
[7842.60s -> 7872.34s]  take too many of them. Can I stand up? What the fuck is this? Oh no. You're really gonna
[7872.34s -> 7878.76s]  throw Yoshi's Island fucking mushroom level at me right now? This is gonna make me sick.
[7882.44s -> 7899.86s]  Oh no. I hate this. Who the fuck are you? Why can I not hit this guy?
[7907.77s -> 7917.45s]  Dog has like two heads. Please tell me I can like first try this. This is actually
[7917.45s -> 7927.93s]  gonna give me a problem. Alright, come on, let's go. Congratulations, you beat the level.
[7933.45s -> 7933.95s]  Uh...
[7938.79s -> 7950.23s]  Is that a bear? There's an actual bear in here. What the fuck? What? Okay, I get...
[7962.54s -> 7967.98s]  No, I get it. I get it. Well, actually, I don't get it. I'll get it if something else happens.
[7968.54s -> 7985.18s]  Alright, wait. So this is... Alright, this is... I get it. I get it. I understand it.
[7988.20s -> 8010.20s]  What? Gotta get a grip. Gar. Uh-oh, windows. Of course. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
[8015.03s -> 8019.35s]  Yeah, alright. He's on a... This is... This happened in like the third level, didn't it?
[8024.04s -> 8034.20s]  I get it. No, I get it. That was like the zebra. What is that? Uh, I guess I'm gonna...
[8034.84s -> 8046.26s]  Does that explosion hurt me? I apologize to those of you that are, you know,
[8046.26s -> 8070.70s]  photo-sensitive to this kind of shit. I don't even know if I'm shooting this. Was that a tiger?
[8071.34s -> 8094.06s]  Did I win? I did. That's it. Keep going. I got an axe. Um, I don't remember bats.
[8098.52s -> 8102.28s]  Oh no, it's the two ducks. Okay, it's the... It's my favorite character! Ooh.
[8103.08s -> 8127.69s]  That's my favorite character. Or two characters. Uh, alright. Oh, ffff...
[8128.65s -> 8141.02s]  Alright, it's just doing a gigantic fire-breathing dragon. Oh my goodness. Um,
[8142.22s -> 8156.81s]  I killed one of them before. Dodge it? Easier said than done. Are they immune to damage?
[8167.35s -> 8187.00s]  Oh, okay. I see. Holy fuck. Alright, so I can only hurt them at a specific time. Oh man.
[8190.04s -> 8217.14s]  When can I hit you? Do it! Sorry, swans. Whoops. Do I need that? I hope not. Is this the end
[8217.14s -> 8231.08s]  of the game? That's it? Okay, that's the end of the game. No, the last game had a post-credits
[8231.08s -> 8241.86s]  chapter, right? That's probably what's gonna happen. Well, yeah, the ending was not actually
[8241.86s -> 8251.26s]  the ending. Out of chronological order. Uh, so I... I have no idea what the fuck that game was.
[8251.98s -> 8258.65s]  I have no idea what happened. I have a general understanding of kind of what happened,
[8258.65s -> 8273.32s]  but I don't think I do. There's a video on YouTube that greatly explains it all.
[8278.52s -> 8287.75s]  Because that was- that was the son of the first game boss. And they were all part- they were
[8287.75s -> 8305.27s]  all in a military troop together, right? First game is Jacket, and no, the- the- the son- that
[8305.27s -> 8310.60s]  son wasn't like part of the group. But I'm talking about the whole thing. There was so
[8310.60s -> 8315.96s]  many characters- one guy was a serial killer? Alright, so Evan, what's your opinion? Do you
[8315.96s -> 8320.95s]  think there's any truth to his claims of a conspiracy? I couldn't find any substantial
[8320.95s -> 8324.79s]  proof of a conspiracy, but my research strongly indicates that there might have been one.
[8325.35s -> 8331.19s]  Hopefully my book will get people to start asking questions. Perhaps a more thorough
[8331.19s -> 8335.11s]  investigation can be conducted in the future. You're implying that the official investigation
[8335.11s -> 8339.27s]  wasn't thorough? From the police reports I've seen, the investigation was a complete mess.
[8339.99s -> 8343.03s]  A lot of stones were left unturned, so many questions left unanswered.
[8343.59s -> 8346.39s]  I really hope we'll get to the bottom of the whole incident one day.
[8347.27s -> 8349.51s]  And when can we expect to read this book of?
[8351.67s -> 8354.70s]  We are interrupting the program for an emergency broadcast, the president of the
[8354.70s -> 8359.19s]  united states has been assassinated. A press conference in washington was uninterrupted by
[8359.19s -> 8364.63s]  a league of armed men during what appears to be a coup d'etat. The president was shot and
[8364.63s -> 8368.31s]  killed, the russian president was also shot dead in the chaos that ensued- what?
[8368.31s -> 8372.79s]  The ringleader of the uprising appears to be a u.s army general- in this time no official
[8372.79s -> 8376.98s]  statements have been made experts believe this will be seen as an act of
[8376.98s -> 8380.78s]  war against Russia the fear of repercussions may be severe stay tuned
[8380.78s -> 8387.82s]  as we will be purporting live from looks like you've gotten yourself quite
[8387.82s -> 8391.70s]  comfortable over here you know what they say about good times don't you
[8391.70s -> 8397.95s]  yeah good times never last that's right soon this will all be over I had a
[8397.95s -> 8403.81s]  feeling things would catch up with me are they on to me oh no this this
[8403.81s -> 8410.30s]  is much worse how long do I have you you don't have much time no one
[8410.30s -> 8415.06s]  does there's nothing I can do about it right no by now there's nothing anyone
[8415.06s -> 8423.10s]  can do about it okay no need to fight it then I'm glad you understand leaving
[8423.10s -> 8440.47s]  this world is not as scary as it sounds was on drugs so that was on
[8440.47s -> 8455.17s]  drugs nuke didn't that happen in the first one too didn't that happen in
[8455.17s -> 8467.78s]  the first game huh okay no didn't you like walk out of the door in the
[8467.78s -> 8484.97s]  first game at the store and it did this so this is a nuke was drunk no
[8484.97s -> 8533.73s]  that was in this game okay so it's the war between USA and Russia this is
[8533.73s -> 8553.02s]  the prequel we're getting pulp fiction this is the opening to smash
[8553.02s -> 8574.91s]  ultimate I'm not really I mean so many computer entertainment they had really I
[8574.91s -> 8583.76s]  thought it was just I'll go insane if I play hard mode no I can't do a hard

[8621.08s -> 8624.78s]  started and a bunch of people in chat said he's not gonna finish this game

[14568.69s -> 14579.10s]  know that should be enough of that I can actually walk over here now I'm
[14579.10s -> 14584.71s]  not sure I want to they're gonna come oh fuck there's another dog oh fuck all
[14584.71s -> 14603.23s]  right where you go it's the disco diaper lying down still there and I
[14603.23s -> 14610.96s]  get Santa from here oh shit what is Santa Santa has chainsaw right all

[14656.66s -> 14666.86s]  remains wait glass no but you're trying to fool me with the glass got
[14666.86s -> 14681.50s]  it that was compact that was the was great I know how to get out of this
[14681.70s -> 14707.88s]  hardest part of the level that was fantastic thank you for that B plus that
[14707.88s -> 14712.26s]  was a lot of work that went in a lot of work went into all these excellent job
[14712.26s -> 14728.30s]  so that leaves us with patrol and pain train as we do patrol oh don't worry
[14728.30s -> 14735.24s]  I'll get Garfield we'll do Garfield before I turn the stream off Garfield
[14735.24s -> 14757.13s]  will be the last one that I attempt so let's do patrol by plank all
[14757.17s -> 14767.78s]  right so that's me sniper rifle I can't shoot I can't just rewind I can't rewind
[14767.78s -> 14789.69s]  no rewinds are allowed actually actual game mechanic all right let's try a
[14789.69s -> 14810.22s]  different approach here give me an open door really whoa what who saw me what
[14810.22s -> 14818.68s]  the hell was that this guy shot me through there I have no idea who's
[14818.68s -> 14844.08s]  shooting me who's shooting me what is he standing up is it it's a turret bush
[14844.08s -> 14860.32s]  it's not this guy is it is it this guy I don't know maybe we'll find him
[14860.32s -> 14876.84s]  later I like the sniping aspect of it oh I got that thought that was a wall
[14876.84s -> 14898.64s]  so I can snipe you from here okay it leaves who that guy right there what
[14898.64s -> 14912.82s]  the hell is oh can I even kill these guys I think these guys and I think these
[14912.82s -> 14921.18s]  guys are turrets I think that's that that's actually by design I think I'm
[14921.18s -> 14928.22s]  pretty sure maybe I can melee the turrets because if I go like this oh
[14928.22s -> 14937.96s]  boy he's just not turning well wouldn't I be able to shoot him then
[14937.96s -> 14964.57s]  like he's no that those guys are definitely supposed to stay alive so I
[14964.57s -> 14967.15s]  can't go this way I gotta go the other way once I take out the this
[14967.15s -> 14972.12s]  big dude once the big dude is dead what about it this way I guess I can wrap
[14972.12s -> 14983.20s]  around you know I can't I'm supposed to get in there this guy shoots through
[14983.20s -> 14999.96s]  here I gotta get a good spot to shoot this guy hmm I'm the let's see all
[14999.96s -> 15011.59s]  right now I wonder if I can just walk up here and then down huh whoa
[15011.59s -> 15021.56s]  melee melee melee melee well I have to get close enough before I can do
[15021.56s -> 15052.52s]  that gonna take these guys out again let's try it again okay I'm gonna try
[15052.52s -> 15069.62s]  doing that again I have to shoot this dude now get in here but um I can't
[15069.62s -> 15072.56s]  stand here you can shoot through the door I feel like you shot through the
[15072.56s -> 15091.03s]  door last time no it was somebody else oh fuck man I think I can so who
[15091.03s -> 15095.43s]  is who is this which I don't know guys shooting me because this guy
[15095.43s -> 15111.53s]  dies where's the other big guy he's right there so I'm gonna I'm gonna have
[15111.53s -> 15129.95s]  to snipe through this hole I feel like I kind of have to how do I line that
[15129.95s -> 15141.72s]  up is he gonna shoot me if I go like that through there maybe but I think
[15141.72s -> 15146.21s]  that's gonna be hard to get over there I think I can do it from like
[15146.21s -> 15157.96s]  a better angle I don't think so I'm gonna have to run in and shoot
[15157.96s -> 15164.97s]  through here right like this what the fuck who the hell are why are you
[15164.97s -> 15185.14s]  standing whoa what that just scraped my brain what the hell I actually all
[15185.14s -> 15195.18s]  right so fuck just come out here so I can figure this out again what in the
[15195.18s -> 15198.34s]  name of God all right so they have to melee that guy and they they're not
[15198.34s -> 15226.19s]  just turrets they're not turrets so I I didn't even shoot that guy all
[15226.23s -> 15234.11s]  right here we go again so now maybe I should just shoot the wall and bait
[15234.11s -> 15253.12s]  this guy okay that changes things I just just shoot him just shoot the fucking
[15253.12s -> 15269.64s]  guy well the reason I thought it was a
[15269.64s -> 15272.08s]  turret is because they were shooting backwards and they weren't doing any
[15272.08s -> 15280.94s]  animations so I mean what am I supposed to think all right let's take
[15280.94s -> 15292.89s]  a look I don't there's any way I can get shot in here it's gonna pick
[15292.89s -> 15333.60s]  this guy off fucking dumb door really you give me a break so then fuck it just
[15333.60s -> 15338.83s]  do this why would I ever even do this just attack them they're not like
[15338.83s -> 15347.38s]  turrets to just go like this and then maybe I can go in that room now
[15347.38s -> 15365.53s]  someone snuck up on me there all right then you're here I think
[15365.53s -> 15375.43s]  somebody's coming out here I can't get off that okay so now I'm safe to go
[15375.43s -> 15378.63s]  up here and into this room because this guy's not here anymore so let me
[15378.63s -> 15393.45s]  see what's available up here hmm I guess I could just pull them but this
[15393.45s -> 15405.09s]  takes a while to switch back I gotta be careful okay anybody have line of sight
[15405.09s -> 15417.65s]  no but this guy is he stand I don't is that guy standing no not anymore okay
[15417.65s -> 15444.35s]  much left one guy no more than one guy I'll wait for you and leaves just
[15444.35s -> 15471.95s]  to you sorry well okay let's try this way whoa all right I think I have to pull
[15471.95s -> 15497.56s]  you first the right idea really you saw me through here there's one more
[15497.56s -> 15504.33s]  guy over there but see if I can kill this dude right now hmm nowhere I'm
[15504.33s -> 15535.72s]  gonna go this way really it sucks there a guy with melee that was down
[15535.72s -> 15569.65s]  there no god what the fuck I'm trying to right-click okay gotta get the fat
[15569.65s -> 15603.11s]  guy here just bait these guys I can kill them what killed me what did I
[15603.11s -> 15616.50s]  shot this guy down here don't fuck yourself guy oh my god I thought I hit
[15616.50s -> 15637.85s]  a knife really what is what are you talking about what the fuck come on oh
[15637.85s -> 15649.72s]  boy let's kill me I have to wait till he stands but I can't see when he
[15649.72s -> 15692.51s]  stands I can't move give me a break happens every fucking time let's try
[15692.51s -> 15706.96s]  this again so one of these guys has a gun I got a slow down I don't have
[15706.96s -> 15711.42s]  any ammo oh no that's not good is there ammo down here somewhere is
[15711.42s -> 15724.25s]  everybody left down there am I gonna shot oh god please tell me no it was
[15724.25s -> 15739.40s]  coming up here good thing I have ammo right next to me that makes this a lot
[15739.40s -> 15755.84s]  easier so where's the last guy in there pig or something oh holy shit that
[15755.84s -> 15761.92s]  good thing I didn't move oh my god that's so lucky that I didn't move I
[15761.92s -> 15779.41s]  need to get to a good spot because this guy what the hell you gotta be
[15779.61s -> 15819.38s]  tethered right like that threw me off so bad why did he tether at the door he
[15819.38s -> 15822.30s]  like ran right to the edge of the door and then just instant turned around
[15822.30s -> 15829.19s]  went back well now I have to go back down here wasn't there somebody else
[15829.19s -> 15856.93s]  over this guy right here I'm gonna kill this guy first because oh fuck not
[15856.93s -> 15864.25s]  this time just go step in the fucking head it's not it who's left
[15864.25s -> 15897.16s]  what's happening oh this one guy right here give me ammo oh dear oh dear I go
[15897.16s -> 15911.98s]  this way I can't go that way hmm you're gonna have line of sight on me
[15911.98s -> 15919.73s]  here isn't it it's so that's so weird to do trying to like keep it on him

[19072.32s -> 19075.76s]  long-lost son Tony so you could see what it feels like to take care of a
[19075.76s -> 19081.25s]  worthless cat like you huh so you thought instead we end up bonding quite

[19622.30s -> 19632.30s]  arrows I was following the red arrows come on that's not my fault come on
[19632.30s -> 19661.54s]  melee come here come here come here there is I need a hard John Garfield
[19661.54s -> 19664.98s]  Garfield think about what you're doing remember all the good times we

[19673.75s -> 19698.46s]  so thanks for all the years that's it hey Garfield oh hi Tony they're showing
[19698.46s -> 19702.06s]  the fly on TV why am I still have my eyes bucket out of my head
[19702.06s -> 19712.32s]  oh that's a good movie grab a cold one son you know they shot an alternate
[19712.32s -> 19718.24s]  ending for this oh yeah yeah Veronica has a dream of her baby with
[19718.24s -> 19722.68s]  butterfly wings oh that's beautiful especially after all the gruesome things
[19722.68s -> 19740.55s]  yeah it's kind of burp well there we go I love the Garfield created by Jim
[19740.55s -> 19748.08s]  Davis you notice the continuity error in this campaign by the way 21st as
[19748.08s -> 19750.48s]  he's thankful of being unemployed but later he says he's jealous of people
[19750.48s -> 19752.56s]  who have jobs that kind of shit happens when you work without notepad
[19752.56s -> 19755.20s]  and don't write down your story apparently or is it a continuity or
[19755.20s -> 19758.44s]  maybe Tony was just trying to impress his whole friends sadly we
[19758.44s -> 19760.44s]  might never know the true background of this mystery nevertheless I hope you
[19760.44s -> 19762.40s]  enjoyed and check out my other campaigns a brave man is a man who
[19762.40s -> 19768.52s]  dares to look the devil in the face James Garfield
[19770.61s -> 19782.94s]  well that was outrageous it was absolutely outrageous I think that's a
[19782.94s -> 19795.59s]  great one to go out on well Garfield actually said that all those it's a
[19795.91s -> 19807.68s]  actually surprising to see just how high quality and worthy of being in the game
[19807.68s -> 19816.40s]  type of content that people are making and I don't think I even scratched the
[19816.40s -> 19823.64s]  surface there's a lot to bet you were too cowardly to read half the story
[19823.64s -> 19835.86s]  I'm not going to play the Shrek one maybe one day you'll just know I'm
[19835.86s -> 19840.63s]  not gonna not playing Shrek you can call me a coward all you want I'm
[19840.71s -> 19904.40s]  gonna play the Shrek campaign coward coward coward coward coward I can't
[19904.40s -> 19919.98s]  believe John drank dog no I'm not saying it my god no all right no
[19919.98s -> 19924.50s]  that's not a coward because I don't want to say I guess if I say that then
[19924.50s -> 19963.74s]  I get to be edited in a hundred thousand different ways I don't what a
[19963.74s -> 19982.78s]  load of bullshit well time all right that hey good night everybody that's
[19982.78s -> 19994.91s]  where we're gonna end thanks for coming out to the stream that's where
[19994.91s -> 20003.12s]  we're gonna end see you next time it's just an expression what's saying
[20003.12s -> 20012.20s]  I'm going to go jack it I'm concerned for the future of content and when I
[20012.20s -> 20029.70s]  press them when I click the button I gotta take a break I do I can't play
[20029.70s -> 20034.77s]  this game for more than like six hours it's a great game maybe maybe you'll
[20034.77s -> 20039.23s]  see Shrek start the next stream so I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do
[20039.23s -> 20044.74s]  tomorrow I have to come up with something because my plan was I was
[20044.74s -> 20055.85s]  gonna play Atlas tomorrow but that has been delayed so we'll figure
[20056.45s -> 20064.46s]  I have a couple of potential ideas play Shrek all right I will play I will play
[20064.46s -> 20069.19s]  this Shrek campaign tomorrow okay but we're not but doing something else
[20069.19s -> 20077.71s]  after that somebody just in all capitals called me a liar well then
[20077.71s -> 20083.26s]  you're gonna have to tune in tomorrow we got him no you don't I get but I
[20083.26s -> 20092.60s]  didn't say how long I was gonna play it for why you make this this
[20092.60s -> 20098.36s]  campaign probably took like 30 hours of work to make you know it's not
[20098.36s -> 20102.56s]  fucking I'm making my own campaign I'm gonna make my own hotline Miami to
[20102.56s -> 20120.59s]  campaign and we're gonna play it it's gonna be terrible but good night
[20120.59s -> 20126.18s]  everybody I'll see you tomorrow final thoughts on hotline Miami as a series
[20126.18s -> 20135.10s]  there's a great series the first one I enjoyed a little more than the second
[20135.10s -> 20139.66s]  ones campaign but the second had way more content and much more to do it
[20139.66s -> 20145.48s]  was way harder both very very good games I would highly recommend them
[20145.52s -> 20158.64s]  wrong overlay oops well that was embarrassing two has the better music I
[20158.64s -> 20164.62s]  mean they're both great I would probably say if the first one's not as
[20164.62s -> 20171.13s]  difficult as the second one second one's a lot larger there's a lot more
[20171.13s -> 20178.14s]  enemies people are off-screen there's a lot more windows and more doors I like
[20178.14s -> 20186.30s]  this new end stream that's right it's just pulling from Shrek and there's
[20186.30s -> 20189.82s]  a the two is worth purchasing for all the community content for sure there's
[20189.82s -> 20201.39s]  so much you know Shrek and Garfield themed campaigns but with that we are
[20201.39s -> 20210.31s]  going to wrap it up we're gonna do the bits and let's actually put on the real
[20210.31s -> 20213.71s]  goodbye music what do you say because this is this is a little too upbeat I
[20213.71s -> 20219.66s]  think there we go but I'll see you guys tomorrow if you're taking off
[20219.66s -> 20230.60s]  we'll figure something out hey German German 258 thanks for the one

[20315.74s -> 20319.42s]  the power to make Jerma say anything Garf wants well as long as there's
[20319.42s -> 20323.18s]  nothing legally binding or morally Garf'd up somehow Jerma would you

[21047.98s -> 21051.87s]  this is the problem I don't know all I know is like I've told you guys
[21051.91s -> 21057.83s]  over the last three or four streams I've been trying to eat a different diet
[21057.83s -> 21061.43s]  I've been trying to stay away from gluten to see if that helps but I've
[21061.43s -> 21066.51s]  been having some weird stomach and back and chest pain for about six
[21066.51s -> 21072.77s]  months and that's why I've kind of been at the doctor a lot to try to
[21072.77s -> 21075.33s]  figure out what the fuck is going on with my body and why it's doing
[21075.33s -> 21086.34s]  this and there's been stay healthy no I'm fine don't worry about me but if
[21086.38s -> 21088.98s]  you're wondering why I'll go to the doctor well I can't stream tomorrow I
[21088.98s -> 21104.56s]  gotta I gotta go to the doctor I need to eat Flintstones but it's
[21104.56s -> 21112.11s]  potentially something as simple as too much bad bacteria and that would be
[21112.11s -> 21120.00s]  really really great if it was because that's very easy to fix but
[21120.00s -> 21123.42s]  if that's some really just strange medical happenings that really has
[21123.42s -> 21138.06s]  nothing to do with my intestines quick send him taffy see I would feel
[21138.06s -> 21146.90s]  so much better if I had some taffy no all jokes aside I'll figure it out
[21146.90s -> 21155.30s]  don't worry about me I'm fine but I am there I did I have been at the doctor
[21155.30s -> 21161.77s]  a few times don't worry about me I'm gonna be just fucking fine eat fish

[21189.21s -> 21191.29s]  your video since the beginning and you've always had the ability to help
[21191.29s -> 21194.57s]  with my depression and make me feel better without fail I'm at the lowest
[21194.57s -> 21199.25s]  point in my life so far and I want to hear what advice you might have
[21199.25s -> 21203.67s]  love you and I'm glad I've never you've never stopped making me laugh
[21205.55s -> 21216.35s]  it's the same advice that I I say kind of often right that's sometimes you
[21216.35s -> 21223.34s]  might feel pretty fucking low right now right but you got to take each day
[21223.34s -> 21232.41s]  at a time is slow it doesn't happen overnight it takes a while but as long
[21232.41s -> 21236.09s]  as every day or every you know once a week once every few days you're
[21236.09s -> 21242.35s]  really trying to either better yourself or try to figure out why it's
[21242.39s -> 21258.11s]  not easy and I always feel I always feel for people that you know say this
[21258.11s -> 21264.15s]  kind of shit because you know I've been there you guys have heard the stories
[21264.15s -> 21270.75s]  before I've felt like fucking shit before you know ten years ago or so
[21270.75s -> 21297.65s]  you just got to try you know you're so sweet chairman no I mean I but I
[21297.65s -> 21303.80s]  want also to you know have people realize that there isn't just a simple
[21303.80s -> 21307.00s]  hope this is how you fix it that's it it's all fucked up that's how you fix
[21307.00s -> 21311.16s]  it because everybody's so different you everybody has such different wildly
[21311.16s -> 21315.80s]  different personalities viewpoints beliefs things that they like this
[21315.80s -> 21321.20s]  they don't like that it's it's hard somebody a problems right different
[21321.20s -> 21326.10s]  problems there's a lot of different points you can come from so it's
[21326.10s -> 21343.32s]  very very difficult because there's so many ways takes time to get over it
[21343.32s -> 21350.39s]  it does but I really do wish you the best hopefully you get it all
[21350.39s -> 21366.40s]  figured out much love to you somebody said therapy therapy
[21366.40s -> 21371.68s]  helps yeah if it's something you think would help you could get out there
[21371.68s -> 21380.41s]  start talking to somebody because you never really want to have it just kind
[21380.41s -> 21387.58s]  of sit there and just wallow inside over and over and over again it's
[21387.58s -> 21396.11s]  it's not healthy you know it really is better to at least have somebody
[21396.11s -> 21401.40s]  that either knows or is a professional and I'm not a professional at all that's
[21401.40s -> 21406.68s]  another thing I guess we need to address is I can only tell you the
[21406.68s -> 21410.24s]  things that have helped me or the things that I think are a good idea
[21410.24s -> 21419.69s]  but at the end of the day I'm not really equipped for it but I really do
[21419.69s -> 21426.88s]  wish you the best hopefully you figure it out soon takes time I am a
[21426.88s -> 21430.20s]  professional streamer oh well I'm not a professional therapist or a
[21430.20s -> 21441.10s]  psychiatrist so there is that not a professional gamer I've never went if I

[22574.10s -> 22579.75s]  too much blood so are you gonna let me ask you guys guys be like this
[22579.75s -> 22589.56s]  because I'm like this when I go to the doctor and I get my blood taken and you
[22589.56s -> 22595.04s]  sit there I've by the way I've never seen ever I've never seen a needle go
[22595.04s -> 22601.37s]  into my arm I've never looked at it I don't know what it looks like I have
[22601.37s -> 22604.89s]  no idea what the mechanism is I just know that it hurts for a second and
[22604.89s -> 22612.60s]  that's it and I don't look it changes oh yep I don't ever want to
[22612.60s -> 22618.22s]  know so what I do is I did this little technique that right when the needles
[22618.22s -> 22624.06s]  about to go in for either a shot or for blood work I will take my index finger
[22624.06s -> 22627.22s]  and I'll put it on my let's say I'm getting blood drawn from my left arm
[22627.22s -> 22631.86s]  I'll put my index finger down on my right knee and I just got just give a
[22631.86s -> 22635.10s]  little bit of a little scratch little little scratch scratch on my
[22635.10s -> 22639.28s]  right knee not hard or anything because it tricks your brain once it
[22639.28s -> 22642.26s]  goes you know okay they say here comes the pinch I just start
[22642.26s -> 22647.02s]  scratching and then you it your brain doesn't know where to feel a sensation
[22647.02s -> 22652.64s]  so you're kind of like messes with your brain anyways after the first because I
[22652.64s -> 22656.00s]  had to get like seven vials taken out of me and that I saw that and I
[22656.00s -> 22660.92s]  was like oh okay well I'll be alright after one vial you kind of just sit
[22660.92s -> 22665.16s]  in there and you say okay everything's fine they got that's the one vial I
[22665.16s -> 22670.60s]  usually only have like one or two vials take after the third vial I
[22670.60s -> 22676.60s]  could really start to feel like they were draining my life force vial number
[22676.60s -> 22681.20s]  four and five I could just you know when you're getting blood taken and you
[22681.20s -> 22685.36s]  just talk to like the nurse or the nurse practitioner and you hate every
[22685.36s -> 22690.24s]  second of it so uh how you know you just move here yeah yeah I just moved

[22710.00s -> 22713.76s]  hard as I can to focus on trying not to panic internally and now I have to
[22713.76s -> 22722.65s]  tell you what my favorite food is and at like vial number six and seven I
[22722.65s -> 22726.93s]  don't like I don't care about needles they don't scare me I'm not

[22748.60s -> 22752.80s]  that seventh file I remember like the world was kind of starting to close in
[22752.80s -> 22758.10s]  and it wasn't because I was scared of the needle it was because I think
[22758.10s -> 22761.30s]  they were just taking I think they were just taking all my blood you
[22761.30s -> 22771.14s]  know I'm sitting there like they're taking too much I think here we go

[23920.28s -> 23924.42s]  you've beaten it so if you have does that mean we could have mods versus
[23924.42s -> 23930.40s]  German tournament if you were here earlier when I talked about smash I I'm
[23930.40s -> 23937.85s]  painfully bad at it I get so just slam dunked on every single game that
[23937.85s -> 23940.45s]  it's probably not something I'm going to stream I went through world of
[23940.45s -> 23948.88s]  light I went through about 60% of it so I still have about 30 or 40% of

[24311.11s -> 24316.09s]  a good time be feel bad about themselves or their life you know I
[24316.65s -> 24333.76s]  genuinely it makes me feel fucking bad so because I take a look at you know the
[24333.76s -> 24339.28s]  things that have happened in my life and where I've gone and where I want to
[24339.28s -> 24346.83s]  go and where I've been and it's um we all we're all doing this together
[24346.83s -> 24353.28s]  we're all doing it in the same time you know and I would feel terrible if

[24379.45s -> 24387.13s]  watching me suffer it's so it's a comfort when you care that just
[24387.13s -> 24405.24s]  shouldn't be how it is that just shouldn't be the way it is and I don't
[24405.24s -> 24410.16s]  think it is I think it's just like a people thing I mean I I always feel
[24410.16s -> 24415.30s]  terrible when somebody just doesn't feel like good enough doesn't feel
[24415.30s -> 24427.86s]  fucking smart enough doesn't feel good enough doesn't feel liked or don't
[24427.86s -> 24432.71s]  worry about what other people think that's tough though you know because
[24432.71s -> 24437.59s]  it's I say the same thing like oh just let things be yeah we know if
[24437.59s -> 24440.55s]  somebody wants to be like a dick about something or if somebody wants to be
[24440.55s -> 24444.71s]  like genuinely like and we're not talking about like banter right we're
[24444.75s -> 24451.12s]  talking about like genuinely feeling bad and being treated poorly nobody wants to
[24451.12s -> 24472.61s]  feel like that well I do think about it a lot because I've got into this
[24472.61s -> 24478.04s]  position here where you know there are a lot of people that watch this stream

[25293.96s -> 25300.24s]  know because of me going to bed and getting up such strange times I'm
[25300.24s -> 25309.63s]  probably gonna I really don't know because there's a chance that I go eat
[25309.63s -> 25316.47s]  food and then go food blood pass out it's possible I'm thinking such a big
[25316.47s -> 25321.88s]  deal out of this I had my blood taken yesterday it's like oh you see the
[25321.88s -> 25327.55s]  thing is I had my blood taken yesterday so I'm gonna go to bed like
[25327.55s -> 25332.15s]  I'm blowing that out of proportion so much I'm over exaggerating that so
[25332.15s -> 25343.06s]  much more beatbox okay but I think probably around the normal time
[25343.06s -> 25352.03s]  because there's a chance that I'll stay up but there's an equal chance
[25352.19s -> 25357.07s]  that I fall asleep in like an hour or two so I really don't know forgive me
[25357.07s -> 25361.88s]  I'm sorry I've kind of screwed up my sleep schedule here yesterday but there
