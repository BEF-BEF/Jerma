[1.21s -> 2.57s]  First thing I say when I look over here is,
[2.57s -> 11.10s]  Jeremiah, I'm so disappointed in you. Why? I didn't even have a chance to turn in my homework.
[11.10s -> 19.53s]  I just, okay, it was Saturday and Sunday went by. You were running school. You're the teacher.
[20.49s -> 26.41s]  I come into class. It's been, it's Saturday and Sunday. It's Monday morning at school.
[26.41s -> 32.33s]  I have my backpack. I've got my textbooks. I sit down in the seat at Math 103.
[33.13s -> 36.65s]  Teacher looks at me and goes, Jeremiah, I'm incredibly disappointed with you.
[38.25s -> 44.12s]  I didn't even have a chance to do anything. I just sat down. I was ready to learn.
[51.05s -> 59.21s]  30 months up. That's a long time. God damn, you guys are fast.
[61.34s -> 74.71s]  This is not going to be relaxing. Yes, it is. Imagine not being in Math 104 in 2019.
[79.66s -> 83.10s]  Back seating stream? No, it's not. I know what I'm doing in Picross.
[84.31s -> 89.51s]  By the way, sorry to disappoint all 10,000 of you that just came to the stream right now.
[90.39s -> 98.46s]  But today we're going to play Picross with Chad. This was a democracy. It was voted on.
[100.58s -> 104.02s]  I didn't pick this. I mean, I put, I made it available.
[104.90s -> 111.14s]  This was a pre-stream vote that came down to it.
[111.94s -> 119.05s]  And we're going to hang out and just relax. Everyone's going to be calm and collected.
[119.93s -> 124.47s]  We're going to do some Picross puzzles. We're going to hang out.
[125.11s -> 129.67s]  We're going to have, you know, resident sleeper waiting room for Sims 4 mods tomorrow.
[130.31s -> 133.11s]  I'm sure I'll see that a thousand times because that's what's happening tomorrow.
[146.12s -> 151.00s]  No, this is going to be fun. Look, I've had, the VR has been so intense
[152.09s -> 159.18s]  that I got to shut off for a little while. So I'm going to play Picross,
[159.18s -> 166.34s]  this Twitch integration. Are you really playing? Oh yeah, that's tomorrow.
[168.18s -> 172.10s]  There's a first-person mod for the Sims 4 that I want to try.
[175.62s -> 178.66s]  There's also a couple of other things that I have not enabled,
[181.51s -> 187.06s]  but I need to play first-person Sims. He's never going to play Seaman. Yes, I will.
[187.70s -> 191.10s]  Can you please beat the Abyss Watchers in Sims 4?
[193.56s -> 196.44s]  We don't talk about that stream. We, we bury that.
[202.54s -> 204.14s]  God, that's the most fucked up I've ever been.
[205.62s -> 208.66s]  That's the most, I was just like mentally fucking all over the place for that stream.
[209.54s -> 213.70s]  Puzzle streams will never be relaxing. Just you wait.
[214.66s -> 218.02s]  So I don't know what time it is where you are. I don't know what you're doing right now,
[219.14s -> 225.53s]  but you made it here. I'm going to take that opportunity to fill in squares on a grid.
[226.17s -> 230.09s]  I will explain it. I will tell you step-by-step instructions.
[230.81s -> 243.24s]  So like get in bed with your iPhone or your iPad, scrunch your neck down and your chin into
[243.24s -> 247.32s]  your chest, lying on your back because that's fucking impossible. Can somebody please invent
[247.96s -> 254.90s]  something to watch TV in bed? And I'm not talking about one of those giant pillows you put with the
[254.90s -> 261.78s]  chair pillows. Why is there no device that attaches to your neck, like locks around your
[261.78s -> 269.54s]  neck like a collar and mechanically like lifts your fucking head up and there's like pulls it
[269.54s -> 275.14s]  up like out of its socket almost. And then there's a crane arm that has your iPhone or
[275.14s -> 279.30s]  your iPad attached to it up around like almost like a desk lamp in front of your face.
[280.42s -> 287.94s]  Hi, nobody's made that yet. You're yelling. This is supposed to be real. I'm sorry.
[290.18s -> 295.34s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're supposed to be chill. I don't know. Okay. Let me,
[295.34s -> 300.23s]  I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you a real reality of something that happened today.
[300.23s -> 304.63s]  Okay. I don't know why I did this, but this is real. This is not a joke.
[306.18s -> 313.45s]  Picross stream. I drank a 12 ounce of Red Bull before this stream and I don't fucking drink
[313.45s -> 323.02s]  that shit. I don't know why I decided to do that today. Forget about all the intent shit
[323.02s -> 328.78s]  that all the VR streams. No, today is the day that I decide to drink a fucking Red Bull.
[331.50s -> 338.39s]  That's not how you relax. It has, okay, it had Pac-Man on it. That's why I was like,
[338.39s -> 344.98s]  I have to drink this. I'm already like fucking, my hands are moving and stuff.
[344.98s -> 362.31s]  I'm going to have to relax. I don't know why I did that. I don't know why, but I have no reason.
[363.11s -> 367.00s]  I just want to make sure everyone's very clear before I get started here.
[368.25s -> 372.65s]  Some of you might be expecting this. This is probably a joke. Oh, and that's like a funny
[372.65s -> 377.85s]  bit. Like what are we actually doing today? No, this is what we're doing today. I just
[377.85s -> 390.10s]  want to make that clear. I need that. I have to make that clear. There it is. You can tell
[390.18s -> 397.56s]  by the Super Mario blocks. Is there audio here? And again, I'm going to, I'm telling you,
[397.56s -> 417.00s]  I'm going to go, shit, what did I just do? No, everybody relax. You know, don't make me do it.
[417.00s -> 424.52s]  I'll do it. We talked about it in the pre-stream chat. I'll do it. You guys that were here
[424.52s -> 436.06s]  before the stream started, you know what I'm talking about. I don't, don't test me here.
[436.06s -> 442.41s]  I'll put on four and a half hour slow mode. So you only get one message for the whole
[442.41s -> 457.90s]  stream. Yeah, I'm going to force you to relax. Two messages. Ah, that's right. That's right.
[457.90s -> 465.66s]  I'm automatically putting a limit here of a four and a half hour stream. I know nobody said that.
[465.66s -> 471.74s]  We're doing nobody photos for this. I had an extreme elimination, pre-stream elimination
[471.74s -> 482.28s]  tournament. So let's, let's do it. Everybody just chill out. Welcome to the stream. And
[482.28s -> 486.38s]  if you're like, fuck this guy, see you tomorrow. That's fine. I'll see you tomorrow
[486.38s -> 493.45s]  for the Sims 4 mods. But no, I bet you this is, you know what, you know, I bet you this is going
[493.45s -> 501.27s]  to be one of my most viewed streams this year. Anyone want to raise their hand and take that
[501.27s -> 514.90s]  fucking auction? Cause I kind of don't. Anyways, so here we go. By the way, there is Twitch
[514.90s -> 526.73s]  integration and I don't know how it works yet. Let's see. Does it work? Big Bits just came
[526.73s -> 537.51s]  in right now from Great Canadian Fuck Club. Thank you Great Canadian for the $50. Appreciate
[538.33s -> 544.33s]  it. No, you can't. Don't get out of bed. Stay in bed. I'm getting a little heated right now.
[544.33s -> 548.33s]  I'm supposed to be relaxing. Great Canadian. Thank you so much. I'm not going to bed and you
[548.33s -> 558.65s]  can't make me dad. This Twitch integration. I don't know how it works. I think you can do
[558.65s -> 566.34s]  like exclamation point. Oh, I got to, but let's get through the tutorial. Let me explain
[566.34s -> 569.70s]  how this works. Okay. I don't need to read any of this shit down here. Cause I can tell you
[569.70s -> 579.88s]  how it works, but great Canadian. Thank you so much for the $50. All right. Relax everybody.
[581.21s -> 591.29s]  It's not cues. Ready? Let me explain how this works. As you said that I got out of my bed.
[591.29s -> 603.86s]  All right. That's enough. All right. All right. All right. Everything relax.
[604.68s -> 609.11s]  How this I see the chat and I can't even fucking relax. It's hard to relax with this.
[609.11s -> 615.03s]  Like a bunch of fucking noises over here. Okay. So pick Ross guys, this is how this works.
[616.23s -> 621.69s]  You get a grid. It could be five by five. It could be 10 by 10 and people are,
[621.69s -> 624.09s]  this is Twitch integration right here. How'd you guys figure, how'd you guys do that?
[627.83s -> 639.43s]  Is this you guys down here? Why is it only two people? Yeah. You guys don't think I got a
[639.43s -> 649.30s]  secure password. That's fucking 86 characters long. Good luck. All right. Here you go. Here
[649.30s -> 663.61s]  are your chat commands. I guess I can see them down there. Maybe you can check the commands.
[663.61s -> 669.61s]  Maybe. Oh Jesus. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a good,
[669.61s -> 676.31s]  this is not relaxing. This is spam. This is spam. This is not relaxing at all.
[683.22s -> 695.72s]  Anyways, let me, I'm not going to turn that off. All right. Don't before, no,
[695.72s -> 699.48s]  goodbye. All of you. Don't stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop with the
[699.48s -> 703.80s]  integration shit. It doesn't mean anything yet. Let me tell you how to play the game.
[716.71s -> 720.71s]  Okay. So you got a grid. It's a five by five grid.
[721.27s -> 727.29s]  Okay. You have a five by five grid. Stop it. Okay. I'm turning it off. No,
[727.29s -> 731.86s]  not six hour slow mode. Do it. Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. I'm kidding.
[731.86s -> 738.20s]  So how you, you got a grid. There's numbers as you see on the top and on the left,
[738.20s -> 742.01s]  you know, this is for you guys, not for me. So the grid,
[745.16s -> 749.40s]  I can't relax. I can't do this. I'm such a fucked up person. I'm never going to be
[749.40s -> 755.69s]  able to do this stream. You understand? It's like, I'm fucking tied down in a chair right
[755.69s -> 759.29s]  now and I'm like turning into the Hulk and I just want to explode out of the chair.
[760.62s -> 771.66s]  All right. We're good. So what you have to do, what you have to do is like, no, no, no,
[771.66s -> 780.65s]  no, no. That's not right. Okay. I need to relax. So the numbers corresponding on the,
[780.65s -> 783.93s]  I have to close the chat. I have to, I minimize the chat right now. I can't see
[783.93s -> 790.95s]  what you guys are saying. I would be so bad under pressure. I could never work for the CIA.
[791.35s -> 795.03s]  Okay. If I was working for the CIA and they had to like get me to say something or do something
[795.03s -> 799.99s]  or I was going to crack this, put up a fucking Twitch chat next to my face, ask me questions,
[799.99s -> 804.70s]  and then watch like the fail fishes and LULs that I see out of the corner of my eye.
[804.70s -> 809.02s]  I wouldn't be able to do it. I'd crack in a second. You could like rip my fingernails off
[809.02s -> 813.58s]  and I would be like, I'll never tell. I'll never talk motherfucker. You put like a
[813.58s -> 818.95s]  Twitch chat into the left of my eyes and they're doing LULs. I'll be like, okay, so,
[819.91s -> 825.59s]  okay. So, uh, are they laughing at me or, uh, okay. So, uh, the base is about at coordinates
[825.59s -> 838.22s]  four 95, but anyways, so you get a grid here. There are numbers at the top, numbers at the
[838.22s -> 845.72s]  left. You fill in squares. See how I'm doing this? Not that one. Not that one.
[845.72s -> 850.36s]  The numbers on the top and the left, this is how many squares you need to fill in,
[851.38s -> 855.82s]  in this column here. Same thing on this side. So there are five
[855.90s -> 860.62s]  squares that need to be filled in here and there's only five spaces. So deducing with
[860.62s -> 865.02s]  deduction technology, we've deduced that all five squares need to be filled in.
[865.94s -> 871.78s]  Take a look over here on the left. Only one square on this row needs to be filled in. And
[871.78s -> 874.82s]  guess what? It was filled in by us doing this five. We've logically deduced
[875.99s -> 881.27s]  that this is the only one. So therefore it is now grayed out. Take a look at over here.
[881.27s -> 887.67s]  This says zero. As you are well aware, zero means none. So there are no squares to fill in here.
[887.67s -> 894.84s]  Got it? So therefore there are three that need to be filled in here. There's one here already.
[894.84s -> 901.26s]  So guess what? One, two, three. That's where it goes. Notice how now we have our three.
[901.26s -> 905.42s]  We've deducted with our technological brains. Same thing here. See one and one. You're
[905.42s -> 911.26s]  probably asking, what the heck's going on with the two ones? Well, just relax. I'll tell
[911.26s -> 920.34s]  you. This means that there is a space of at least one square between these two numbers. So
[921.06s -> 926.34s]  as you see, we have one here. So this is one of the ones. It's probably the second one,
[926.34s -> 930.74s]  considering that this is already filled in. No more squares are allowed to be here.
[931.54s -> 938.47s]  So our one space one, there has to be at least one empty space. Same thing with this
[938.47s -> 944.52s]  one. So you got one, one solved our first puzzle. Now I can bring the chat back up so you know,
[944.52s -> 948.92s]  and that's F for the string, right? Everyone's going to like say F like rip string.
[950.57s -> 963.59s]  Okay. So now we can bring the chat back. First thing I see is this is shit. Will you relax?
[967.19s -> 970.95s]  So now that you know how this works, let me show you how a master does it.
[976.68s -> 984.39s]  You didn't, did you even get to blink? That's a coffee cup. This game is called
[984.39s -> 998.06s]  PictoPix. You get the relaxing music. They get hard. They're not easy. I'll let you guys do one
[998.06s -> 1004.73s]  in a minute. Don't worry. When do we get to start relaxing? You can right now. So remember,
[1004.73s -> 1017.51s]  we've got five here, five, five again. Just imagine you're at like a lounge. So here's
[1017.51s -> 1025.64s]  another thing. You can actually stop yourself from accidentally filling in squares. So see how
[1025.64s -> 1030.60s]  we're done here. I'm going to put some X's to make sure that I don't accidentally. Oh wait,
[1030.60s -> 1037.08s]  hold on a second. So I don't click down here. This is stressing me out. This shouldn't be
[1037.08s -> 1044.09s]  stressing you out at all. This should be relaxing. We had five community cubs just come in
[1044.09s -> 1052.42s]  from Fitty. Thank you, Fitty for the five community subs. It's not stressful. This
[1052.42s -> 1055.94s]  game was fun when I was in kindergarten. You didn't play this in kindergarten. I can
[1055.94s -> 1060.90s]  guarantee it. I 100% guarantee you did not play this in kindergarten. You weren't smart enough
[1060.90s -> 1072.55s]  for it. Look, that's like a, that's a fucking like Legend of Zelda sword. See, now we have
[1072.55s -> 1084.49s]  some more spaces. It's getting more complicated. $100 just came in. Where? What are you talking
[1084.49s -> 1090.31s]  about? I'm not going to do this yet. You guys need to understand how the game is played
[1091.03s -> 1101.80s]  and I'm getting a vibe that you don't. It was $125 in gifted subs. Five tier. Wait,
[1101.80s -> 1109.43s]  those were tier three subs? Oh shit. I, okay. Those are, why would you give, why would you
[1109.43s -> 1117.94s]  give some tier three subs? Oh my God. Fitty gave five tier three subs. That's a shit
[1117.94s -> 1123.69s]  load of money. Well, congratulations to the people that got the tier three sub.
[1124.41s -> 1130.22s]  We know how to play idiot. That guy's not relaxing on what I'm permanently been.
[1132.78s -> 1136.30s]  Uh, thank you. That's fucking hot. Like what? Hundreds of dollars or something. 100 and like
[1136.86s -> 1145.77s]  50, 200. How much money is that? Is this on steam? It is on steam. I think it's like,
[1146.41s -> 1150.38s]  they might be packs you have to buy. I'm making that up. I don't know, but it's like
[1150.38s -> 1155.74s]  seven bucks. You can also get these for free online, but this one had the Twitch
[1155.74s -> 1158.62s]  integration. So I was like, you know what, why don't I like ignore everybody down here
[1158.62s -> 1164.66s]  that's pressing buttons and you know, give it a try. So as you see, we've got the five
[1164.66s -> 1168.50s]  filled in here and we have our one. Now remember, I want you all to remember
[1169.22s -> 1175.61s]  you're not remembering. Excuse me. Listen, there has to be a space here.
[1180.86s -> 1188.41s]  I'm not relaxed. See three, one, this is the one. So therefore there has to be at least
[1188.41s -> 1194.18s]  one space between all of these. I'm trying. I know. I, I, I'm sorry. And look, take a
[1194.18s -> 1199.54s]  look here. What do you got? What's that? Zero five. There's only three spaces left.
[1199.54s -> 1204.07s]  So fill it in. Same thing with this one. Only three spaces left. Same with this one.
[1204.07s -> 1212.82s]  Only three spaces left. The one, one, one up here is already done. See one three,
[1212.82s -> 1218.78s]  but, but Jerma, I don't get it. If there's one and three, I see one, two, three. I don't
[1218.78s -> 1224.14s]  get it. No, no, no, no. Relax. This is one. There's your space. There it is. Therefore,
[1224.70s -> 1229.83s]  deduce with your brains. One, two, three. That has to be three in a row.
[1230.79s -> 1235.51s]  Bingo. Same thing over here. Right. What's the deal with this one? Can you guys help?
[1236.07s -> 1246.49s]  Can I get some help on this one? This one is the reverse of the other one. Take
[1246.49s -> 1255.83s]  a look at that. Has to be three space one. There it is. That's how many followers and subs I'm
[1255.83s -> 1276.23s]  going to lose a minute on this stream. You just didn't know. Do it yourself. Stupid. Sure.
[1285.21s -> 1290.60s]  I think a friend of mine has this tattooed on their chest and they think it means strength
[1290.60s -> 1305.96s]  in Chinese. I swear to God, that's not, I'm not making that up. It's not me. I don't
[1305.96s -> 1311.70s]  have any tattoos. What are you talking about? All right. Let's see. We got, let's use our
[1311.70s -> 1316.28s]  minds here. So, lock in. I'm not going to click these yet. Not until we get harder.
[1317.00s -> 1320.52s]  I'm going to have a panic attack. Well, relax because here comes a quick one.
[1321.72s -> 1329.70s]  We got, okay. So, nothing here. We got all one there. See? Same thing over here. Same thing here.
[1330.42s -> 1335.78s]  So, guess what? Has to be bingo. Bingo. That takes up the two. You got three. It's done.
[1344.89s -> 1356.22s]  Mind sweeper. This is not mind sweeper. Did it too slow. Who is this guy? My name is
[1356.22s -> 1359.66s]  Jerma. If you are a puzzle enthusiast, you may have found this stream because you're
[1359.66s -> 1365.18s]  like a puzzle enthusiast. I am too. And what we like to do in this stream is we check out
[1365.18s -> 1373.42s]  new puzzle games and we try new mind kind of brain training games. I do, I stream seven days
[1373.42s -> 1378.46s]  a week and I stream 10 hours a day and we do, we, I check out new mind brain training
[1378.46s -> 1385.56s]  exercises every day. Zero, right? Take a look. There's you four. Only can be four.
[1386.58s -> 1390.41s]  Now, wait a minute here. This is where it gets tricky because look at this.
[1391.91s -> 1395.67s]  Okay. So, how are we supposed to know what the heck's going on here? I'll tell you how
[1395.67s -> 1401.67s]  because see, there's a space here. It can't be here. It can't be here. This is the one.
[1401.67s -> 1405.59s]  So, there has to be a space. Two, you got it filled in. Guess what? The two is down here.
[1405.59s -> 1412.17s]  Has to be right there. And then your three spot is there. Your two spot is over here.
[1413.93s -> 1422.06s]  It's a baby. Yep. You must have been a cool substitute teacher. Nobody gets it. What
[1422.06s -> 1433.02s]  do you mean nobody gets it? No, there's no way. How do you not get it? You don't get it. Okay.
[1433.02s -> 1439.10s]  Like, I'll try it again. Let's, let's, let's, shh, relax. Some people don't get it. Ignores
[1439.10s -> 1447.72s]  the nice comment. Was there a nice comment? The nice comment was, was it the bits that just
[1447.72s -> 1453.16s]  came in? C4G, two, thanks for the 250. Canceled my last bits. I changed my mind
[1453.16s -> 1462.95s]  on the pit cross hype. That wasn't a nice message. I've never been less relaxed. Just
[1462.95s -> 1467.11s]  lean back in your chair. Go make popcorn or something. When was the last time you had
[1467.11s -> 1473.30s]  popcorn? Probably been a long time. No, I'm supposed to, I'm supposed to explain this to
[1473.30s -> 1477.14s]  people. Listen. Okay. Here you go. For those of you that have no idea what's going on,
[1477.14s -> 1480.66s]  welcome to the stream. My name is Jerma. I do puzzle games. I stream seven days a week,
[1480.66s -> 1485.14s]  10 hours a day. I've been at this for about 10 years now. I have my own puzzle
[1485.14s -> 1489.70s]  games that I make too. And they involve, you know, mind teasers, brain teasers,
[1489.70s -> 1493.30s]  and little twisties inside your head there. But for, what was that? I was like,
[1493.38s -> 1502.62s]  explain this. Okay. So, all right. Um, how do you, uh, okay. I got, I have to get the CIA
[1502.62s -> 1511.34s]  chat thing out of my way for a second. Okay. Good. All the material. I'd hit the fast forward
[1511.34s -> 1517.32s]  on this part. No, you wouldn't. You would sit here and watch it. All right. Listen, relax.
[1519.00s -> 1524.49s]  So pit cross is a game where this is a lie that people are trolling me. They know how
[1524.49s -> 1528.76s]  this works, but I'm going to do it again, just because a shitload of people did show up
[1528.76s -> 1537.54s]  after I started talking about it. Y'all fast forward, huh? Fast forward, fast forward,
[1537.54s -> 1586.65s]  fast forward. Interesting. Okay. You want to fast forward? So what you are going to do
[1588.98s -> 1599.75s]  is when you take, I'm not really sure how to explain this, but you see all this channel,
[1599.75s -> 1623.86s]  we are a puzzle enthusiast stream. And as you, is the voice changer working? No. Hold on. It's
[1623.86s -> 1653.69s]  not. Oh God. So what we do on this stream is we are a puzzle enthusiast. As you see here,
[1653.69s -> 1668.22s]  the five is five, one, two, three, four, five in a row. What you do is you pull it,
[1668.22s -> 1686.60s]  each consecutive circle until the whole thing is filled. As you see there. Did I tell you
[1686.60s -> 1697.66s]  guys the funny thing that happened to me yesterday at the drive-through? Wow. You're going to laugh
[1697.66s -> 1716.25s]  so hard at me. So I'm in the drive-through and someone behind me decided to beep. I got out of
[1716.25s -> 1731.40s]  the car and got hit in the face with an ice cream. And after, do you guys understand this?
[1733.11s -> 1770.10s]  I think I'm going to have to re-explain it. So as you see here. Yeah. How's that? Can you hear
[1770.10s -> 1783.90s]  me? Can you guys hear me? Fucking relax. So, but really though, sadly, yes, you take that
[1784.14s -> 1799.75s]  back right now or I'm going to anti-relax. I love how people are still doing this. I wish you were
[1799.75s -> 1806.18s]  mute. You don't actually wish that. Don't say something like that. You know, that hurts my
[1806.18s -> 1812.78s]  feelings when you say that. Think about it. You're talking to the streamer. Okay. I wish
[1812.78s -> 1836.31s]  the streamer was muted. Okay. You understand? Okay. Get a life. It's Minecraft cheese. Now,
[1836.31s -> 1841.24s]  you guys want to play? You guys want to play? Let's see if you've learned anything. Okay.
[1845.94s -> 1863.54s]  Good luck. Let's see if you've learned a damn thing. Let's see. Okay. Good. Good. But no,
[1863.54s -> 1868.42s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not good. You didn't do that right. You didn't deduce that
[1868.42s -> 1874.97s]  correctly. That's not correct. How would you know that this was here? One and one. All you
[1874.97s -> 1878.65s]  know is that one is in this row and one's in this column. You can't deduce that logically
[1878.65s -> 1891.11s]  here. Okay. Somebody gets it. Thankfully. Think about it here. What is absolutely,
[1891.11s -> 1907.80s]  completely yes. Okay. Something that you 100% know to be true. Three. Therefore,
[1909.32s -> 1923.69s]  you have to have a space. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, that's true, but you had,
[1923.69s -> 1932.81s]  you had, oh no, that's right. Nevermind. I'll move back. What the hell was that? Why did
[1932.81s -> 1940.73s]  I just like spam a shitload of stuff? I just dumped like, why am I dumping shit in chat here?
[1947.42s -> 1952.14s]  I'm spamming the stream right now. Did you guys remove something? Yes. Very good.
[1953.94s -> 1957.46s]  Because see, notice how you got this one right. This one could not have been possible.
[1958.74s -> 1960.18s]  It's been doing that the whole stream.
[1965.94s -> 1981.91s]  Careful here, guys. I don't think so about that. Think about this. Okay. The chat hurts
[1981.91s -> 1997.59s]  my eyes. You did a pretty good job. You deduced it pretty well. Nice work. You made
[1998.82s -> 2009.54s]  an anchor. Okay. Now it's my turn. Yes. These are still fairly simple. No, no, no, no. Auto play.
[2013.00s -> 2019.51s]  All right. So here we go. I'll show you one too. So let's take a look here. Remember,
[2020.81s -> 2024.01s]  you might be saying, oh boy, how am I going to do this? You're probably like
[2024.01s -> 2026.97s]  gnawing at your fingernails. They're just breaking off like cartoon, like
[2026.97s -> 2030.01s]  Rocco's modern life, just fucking flying everywhere when you move your
[2030.01s -> 2034.60s]  corn on the cobbing, your fingernails. Listen, relax. How you deduced this
[2035.32s -> 2041.05s]  is take a look. You got one, one, one, right? But I don't, I don't know. Just wait a minute.
[2041.05s -> 2051.37s]  Hold on. One space, one space, one. It fills in the whole entire. Now you do this.
[2052.01s -> 2059.99s]  If you, later on, it's going to be like 10, eight, 12, 15, four. They get huge. Count
[2059.99s -> 2067.43s]  these numbers here. One, two, three, right? How many spaces are in between here? At least
[2067.43s -> 2074.68s]  one, at least two. Therefore one, two, three, four, five. It has to fill the whole row.
[2074.68s -> 2085.05s]  We get it. No, you don't. At least 200 people have DMed me on Twitter and they're just like,
[2085.05s -> 2088.17s]  Jerma, I don't understand. Can you explain that the spaces thing again? I'm like,
[2088.17s -> 2097.19s]  I'm trying to help you. Two space, two. So now we have this completely deduced.
[2097.19s -> 2102.39s]  You can fill these in. We don't know exactly where these are, but we do because take a look
[2102.39s -> 2108.94s]  here. Two, two, two, two. It's as simple as that. Three, because it's got to be in the middle and
[2108.94s -> 2120.81s]  there you go. Bingo, bingo. This is second grade shit. We're warming up. Mom said it's my turn
[2120.81s -> 2133.77s]  on the pick, Ross. No, you're going to have to wait. One, three. Uh-huh. You got your three
[2133.77s -> 2146.90s]  here. You got your one, two. Can we stop the stream until everyone understands? No, we cannot.
[2150.09s -> 2159.88s]  Can we stop the stream until everyone? How am I supposed to decide if that's happening or not?
[2159.88s -> 2167.82s]  Can we stop the stream? No. Play binaural beats? No, you guys, you guys want to,
[2167.82s -> 2174.22s]  if you don't, if people don't start relaxing here, I'm going to play a like a 17 hertz
[2175.02s -> 2179.83s]  sound effect on, on YouTube. That's like the fear scary sound that makes you like,
[2179.83s -> 2196.98s]  like feel horrible. I will put that on full blast. All right. There you go. We got our
[2196.98s -> 2205.19s]  middle here. So we got two in here. We got one and one. So remember it can't be over on one
[2205.19s -> 2210.17s]  of these sides. And obviously these, the three has to be one, two, three, one, two, three,
[2210.17s -> 2217.50s]  has to be in the middle here. Play binaural beats. I'm not going to play binaural beats.
[2222.30s -> 2232.60s]  Why would I play binaural beats? It's going to hurt my head. I can't do binaural. Fine.
[2232.60s -> 2237.91s]  I'll try it. Not yet. In a minute. You need to relax. People are going to leave
[2237.91s -> 2255.42s]  because of that shit. That's like painful. Okay. So, uh, no, I fucked that whole thing up.
[2255.98s -> 2281.08s]  It has to be three here. It's probably this. Fuck. This is easy. You guys are in my head.
[2288.57s -> 2299.32s]  I can do like 20 by 20 and I'm like fucked up now. I sit in bed and play this like three
[2299.32s -> 2331.06s]  nights a week at like 30 by 30 grid. I can say things that I can't prove too. Just wait.
[2331.06s -> 2363.29s]  I like, I got lost. This is so easy. No, it can't be that. Why am I? I did like a 30 by 30
[2363.29s -> 2383.54s]  last night in preparation. He's pretending for views. I don't, I can't, I cannot believe that
[2383.54s -> 2421.98s]  I can't do this. I can't relax. I can't do it. I seriously like, I don't know what it is.
[2421.98s -> 2429.53s]  I'll do the next one. I'll do the next 10 in 30 seconds each. I guarantee it. I fucking 100%
[2429.53s -> 2442.06s]  guarantee it. Like I, I don't know what happened. I got stuck in like a, I got stuck in like a
[2442.06s -> 2445.98s]  fucking tunnel and like traffic at work. My brain ran into itself like a thousand times
[2445.98s -> 2460.63s]  because I had, I'm trying to just watch. Ready? Bingo. Say like, I don't know what the fuck
[2460.63s -> 2465.38s]  happened. I don't know what happened. I was pretending for views. Just pretend. Pretend I
[2465.38s -> 2488.39s]  was pretending for views. Honest to God, pretend I was just pretending. Derm of 12 D
[2488.39s -> 2492.62s]  chest. Yeah. I was pretending for views. I was trying to get some like views in here.
[2493.02s -> 2518.39s]  20 seconds left. I'm telling you, I'm fine. So let's see the down or up. It's down here.
[2518.39s -> 2527.67s]  Kind of has to be. And then one, one, it could be one, one. I know one, one. It's no, there
[2527.67s -> 2535.80s]  it is. So then here's your two, one. It can't be down there. You got two, one. And there's
[2535.80s -> 2546.39s]  your two, one. Lame stream guy acts like he's bad. It's so obvious that he's acting and his
[2546.39s -> 2558.12s]  fans still can't tell. Stop it. Now we get real. Okay. Forget about all the dumb shit
[2558.12s -> 2563.21s]  that just happened. I need to relax. I need to go drink another Red Bull and calm down.
[2564.01s -> 2568.94s]  There you see the Maka S. That's fine. We know we got zeros over here.
[2571.35s -> 2581.00s]  This like fucking 1900s piano music I have to get rid of. No, no, not that. Just relax.
[2586.55s -> 2591.51s]  All right. So we got nine here. And those of you that are wondering, wait a minute,
[2591.51s -> 2597.69s]  this is a 10 by 10 grid. What the heck's going on here? Well, it's very simple. You just fill in
[2597.69s -> 2601.77s]  the ones that you know are certain, right? So for instance, this is zero. This is also zero,
[2603.40s -> 2608.57s]  making it a smaller, smaller area. So we know we only have to work in here.
[2609.21s -> 2614.49s]  Guess what? This has to be filled in here. Has to be. Because think about it, right?
[2614.49s -> 2619.69s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[2619.69s -> 2626.31s]  seven, eight, nine. These have to be filled in. I don't know if it's here yet or I don't know
[2626.31s -> 2630.54s]  if it's here yet, but we're going to try to deduce that. Anyways, we've got one, one.
[2631.42s -> 2634.38s]  Those of you that know, we've got the spaces here so we can mark and make sure we know that
[2634.38s -> 2637.34s]  we don't have to touch these because there has to be a space either here or here.
[2638.74s -> 2643.70s]  This is done. And so is this one. Pretty cool shit. You know what I mean?
[2644.26s -> 2651.42s]  So take a look here. Guess what? Four, one, two, three. Doesn't work there,
[2651.42s -> 2660.55s]  but guess what works here? One, two, three, four. Oh, I see. It's a penis. It's not a penis.
[2661.27s -> 2666.95s]  If it is, I will, if this is a penis, I will give a thousand community subs to myself,
[2669.13s -> 2679.00s]  but it has to say penis, like penis. A thousand community subs. I'm hoping there's
[2679.00s -> 2687.00s]  not something like developer troll in here because that would be bad. Anyways, so we've
[2687.00s -> 2696.78s]  got three this way, two already filled in, four this way as well. So two, we can't figure this
[2696.78s -> 2700.06s]  out yet. Four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four could be in either one of these
[2700.06s -> 2707.18s]  spaces, but it's not because look here, see two, that doesn't work because it has to be,
[2707.18s -> 2712.54s]  has to be here because that's impossible for it to be anywhere else. Four now is absolutely
[2712.54s -> 2719.03s]  has to be down there. Got the three already done now. Let's take a look at that. Four
[2719.03s -> 2724.20s]  has to be two in a row. So it could be either here. It's not here because there's the three
[2724.92s -> 2729.62s]  and then look at this perfectly lined up. Don't you just love that fucking satisfying,
[2729.62s -> 2745.59s]  hyper satisfying one, two, it's all it could be. No, it's not. Yes, it is. Wait, what? This,
[2745.59s -> 2757.16s]  this has to be here. Oh, fuck. It's not satisfying. What did we go wrong? What did I,
[2757.16s -> 2769.26s]  hold on. What did I go wrong? This has to be there. Oh, okay. Okay. No, I got it. No,
[2769.26s -> 2774.33s]  no, no, no. It's just so, it's hyper satisfying when you get it. Now we've got two.
[2775.13s -> 2782.52s]  So this is filled in. So there's your two and nine has to be there. No, nine has to be here.
[2785.67s -> 2790.71s]  Imagine being this smart. Imagine never being able to speak in my channel ever again,
[2790.71s -> 2809.19s]  as of right now mods, you know what to do. Power, power, power, power, power, power.
[2810.07s -> 2821.88s]  All right. I almost just passed out. Relax. Play mind show. No, I'm taking a VR break.
[2821.88s -> 2825.56s]  I didn't even tell you the story of what happened when I got done with VR. Did I
[2825.56s -> 2831.46s]  tell you this? What happened here? You know, the reason why I'm not doing VR
[2831.46s -> 2841.00s]  is because my skin was peeling off. Last night, the skin on my forehead, if I rubbed
[2841.00s -> 2852.33s]  gently, skin was coming off of my forehead. I have to stop playing VR for a little while.
[2854.04s -> 2862.55s]  That's normal. Yeah. Is it though? I don't think so. It's laying eggs in my head. Skin peeling off
[2862.55s -> 2868.92s]  my forehead. Yeah. The valve is laying fucking half, half eggs in my head. All right, let's go.
[2868.92s -> 2875.96s]  So we got some two, two, one. Let's see. Two space, one space. Okay. So the two definitely
[2875.96s -> 2886.06s]  has to be here because it's impossible to be here. So the two has to be there. Moisturize
[2886.06s -> 2892.06s]  more and clean your headset. I clean my headset every time. You know how much I clean
[2892.06s -> 2900.79s]  that headset every single time. All right, so it has to be one here somewhere. One, two, three,
[2900.79s -> 2907.10s]  four. One, two, three, four. So it has to be here. All right, in the middle there.
[2907.82s -> 2912.84s]  Don't know if it's up or down. We got a two and a two. We got a one.
[2915.74s -> 2919.74s]  Didn't he say, didn't he moisturize? I moisturize every day. If you don't moisturize
[2919.74s -> 2926.49s]  every day, you got, I mean, you kind of have some issues there. You have to moisturize.
[2927.21s -> 2931.08s]  All right, I deduced it had to be here because there's no way you can do four down
[2931.08s -> 2940.12s]  here. So there's your two. The whole bottom is done. So we got two here though. Do we get to play
[2940.12s -> 2952.04s]  it? You guys can do the next one. All right, we got two, maybe this way. There's also one,
[2952.04s -> 2960.49s]  one and two are here. So two has to be one, two space, one. I want to play. You can play
[2960.49s -> 2968.15s]  a minute. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. So we got one, two, three, four.
[2968.15s -> 2977.69s]  One, two, three, four. Okay, there's your one and your one. There's your two. So that leaves
[2977.69s -> 2992.68s]  us with a one and with them. That's not right. Not right. Not right. How do I undo? Why are you
[2992.68s -> 3005.91s]  guys doing question marks? Now I can see because it's one, two, three, four. One, two, three,
[3005.91s -> 3011.67s]  four. It has to be these two. The four has to be in these two spots. It has to be.
[3012.95s -> 3022.74s]  It's impossible for it not to be. And that's one space, two, two. This is correct.
[3023.54s -> 3030.73s]  So then maybe this is wrong. Oh, let me just see what it looks like here.
[3030.73s -> 3040.09s]  Four. No, that's correct. It has to be there. So then, yeah, this has to be over this way.
[3040.09s -> 3046.12s]  There's no way. Yeah, that's correct. What did I... I fucked up something somehow.
[3054.86s -> 3072.81s]  Yeah, that has to be. Ah, shit. Where the fuck is this then? How do I fuck that up?
[3080.95s -> 3089.53s]  So maybe it has to be here. But then what the fuck happens here? No, I'll go back a little
[3089.53s -> 3094.81s]  bit. I fucked it up somewhere in the very beginning. This is... How do I restart it?
[3094.81s -> 3098.17s]  Let me just restart it. Yeah, restart it. Restart it. I need to look at it again.
[3100.94s -> 3103.50s]  Because, yeah, I don't know what the hell I screwed up in the beginning here.
[3112.26s -> 3124.42s]  Okay. So, yeah, one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Okay. There's your two and
[3124.42s -> 3138.54s]  your two. Okay, that's what I fucked up. That's what fucked up in the beginning. You're
[3138.54s -> 3155.50s]  doing a bad job, not gonna lie. Sorry, you can be banned for life too. So one, two, one,
[3155.50s -> 3162.90s]  two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Has to be here. One, two, three, four. One, two, three,
[3162.90s -> 3178.94s]  four. One, two, three, four. So then two can go either way. Can I be banned too?
[3180.22s -> 3183.66s]  Depends. Is there anything that you'd like to say about how stupid I am?
[3186.97s -> 3192.17s]  Huh? Anything else you'd like to say? Anything else you want to add?
[3192.97s -> 3200.82s]  You're doing a great job, not gonna lie. Thank you. Now the one thing about Picross that's
[3200.82s -> 3206.79s]  if you mess up one tile, it throws your whole brain off. That's why I'm trying to... Once you
[3206.79s -> 3215.24s]  like see it, you're like, oh fuck, okay, now I get it. It has to be in here somewhere.
[3215.80s -> 3224.71s]  So this was one. If one was here, then it has to be here. Because what are you gonna do?
[3224.79s -> 3229.56s]  One and then two? No, that doesn't work. Has to be right there. Now the one on the other hand,
[3229.56s -> 3236.49s]  I don't know. Same thing with this one. This is one, two, two. So it could be two. Yeah,
[3236.49s -> 3242.74s]  has to be that. Or it could be here. Only knows that one's down here and that's it for this.
[3243.54s -> 3250.06s]  So this is where I fucked up last time. This is correct. Because this is the only way this
[3250.06s -> 3260.17s]  can work. You know why? It's because I think for some reason this was the same thing.
[3260.17s -> 3264.39s]  I thought it was one, one, two, one, one, two. That's what happened last time. What's with all
[3264.39s -> 3275.91s]  the question marks? Why? What did I do? I'm getting like a shitload of question marks.
[3279.29s -> 3286.90s]  Okay, so two, two has to be two, two. There can't be anything else.
[3290.42s -> 3299.35s]  That leaves us with one, one, two. This is done. No, it's not. Shit. What am I doing
[3299.35s -> 3319.91s]  wrong here? It can't be anything else. One, one, two, one, two, one. It's not that. Am I
[3319.91s -> 3327.98s]  actually reading this wrong? How? One, one, two, one, two, two. These two are right. They're
[3327.98s -> 3340.10s]  absolutely correct. So this has to be filled in like this then because this is the only
[3340.10s -> 3355.10s]  place I can be. I fucked it all up somehow. Okay, there we go. There's the other two
[3355.82s -> 3360.86s]  and there's the four. All right. It was it's a question. That's why everybody's doing question
[3360.86s -> 3369.42s]  mark. That's why you're doing that. Now I understand. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's why
[3369.42s -> 3379.90s]  everyone was doing that. Oh, oh, rely. Oh, I thought everyone was being just mean
[3380.54s -> 3384.30s]  and being like question mark. Holy shit. Is he this dumb? Just wait.
[3385.18s -> 3388.14s]  Seven, two, there are seven, eight, nine, ten. So it's going to be one, two, three,
[3388.14s -> 3397.03s]  four, five, six, seven, space two. Same deal right here. Let's see five, six, seven, eight,
[3397.03s -> 3404.78s]  nine. Not quite enough, but we got one, two, three, four, five, six. Same thing right here.
[3406.22s -> 3414.73s]  Okay, cool. That leads us to here. So these are done. Two, that's done. And two is done.
[3414.73s -> 3418.82s]  I think we pretty much already figured this whole thing out because three has to be
[3419.46s -> 3431.06s]  right here. Five is one, two three, four, five. This whole top section is done. Two and then two,
[3431.06s -> 3435.78s]  look at where it has to be. Take a look. That's done. Four has to be right here. One,
[3435.78s -> 3441.21s]  two, three, four, five. One, one, one one three. It's a key. It's a penis key.

[5055.62s -> 5061.76s]  where it gets tricky can't be down here can't be this has to be right
[5061.76s -> 5070.21s]  can't be anywhere else this is not done two and then two has to be right here it
[5070.21s -> 5089.58s]  cannot be anywhere else feel the music three has to be here cannot be anywhere
[5089.58s -> 5109.38s]  else two three three could be here it's possible this is so exciting I just
[5109.38s -> 5129.08s]  shit my pants that's on you one two three four five six where's the joke

[5190.11s -> 5197.78s]  one two three four five six got it and then two it has to be there which
[5197.78s -> 5201.98s]  leads you to two which leads you to clear which leads you to two which
[5201.98s -> 5210.65s]  leads you to two which leads you to one anybody getting smarter it's a
[5211.09s -> 5233.71s]  chat's getting bored it's okay it's okay it's okay two three four five six seven

[5562.94s -> 5567.38s]  people think it was team fortress too no if you go back to my channel my
[5567.38s -> 5573.62s]  first two to three hundred videos were Picross and tips and strategies and
[5573.62s -> 5578.06s]  stuff but before I got any sort of viewers I deleted them all because I
[5578.06s -> 5585.93s]  was like I don't think people want to watch this I deleted all of them I was
[5585.93s -> 5605.17s]  gonna leave some up but and you were right to delete them his brown nose
[5605.17s -> 5610.25s]  video yeah yeah we're I had like 200 Picross videos and like 60 brown

[5683.20s -> 5689.28s]  tomorrow off let me tell you something about being over 35 under 35 by
[5689.28s -> 5696.04s]  like a year or two if I drink now if I have like three drinks four drinks
[5696.04s -> 5699.72s]  I literally have to take an entire day the next day lying in my bed
[5699.72s -> 5708.68s]  screaming it sucks no I like autos got to go to the vet in like two days so
[5708.68s -> 5712.04s]  I'm streaming tomorrow I don't have like a hangover tomorrow I don't get
[5712.04s -> 5727.99s]  like hangovers really but I do I don't know I'm hydrating right now no
[5727.99s -> 5733.60s]  autos fine Otto has to go to the vet for a very very basic routine
[5733.60s -> 5745.20s]  procedure he's completely fine don't worry that's that for that row
[5745.20s -> 5751.44s]  closing in I love it when you get that shit done and you can just you
[5751.48s -> 5762.51s]  smell it one two three four five one two three four five nice can't deduce
[5762.51s -> 5774.09s]  where that is though what's with you and shitting tonight it's not me okay
[5774.09s -> 5780.16s]  it's you guys that have this issue you guys telling me to play the brown
[5780.16s -> 5783.92s]  noise you guys telling me to go like poo my pants and stuff I don't know
[5783.92s -> 5789.99s]  what you guys are on tonight but it's not me I'm just reacting to it
[5789.99s -> 5795.22s]  because I'm looking over and I'm like what is going on over here it's
[5795.22s -> 5808.45s]  cuz you drank a Red Bull I know no it's not I didn't drink anything now he's
[5808.45s -> 5825.06s]  flipping us off all right let me finish this so I get five right here good
[5825.06s -> 5837.62s]  three it's done my question is one I still don't have this one somehow you
[5837.62s -> 5842.86s]  three here let's see one two three four five yeah it's probably these two
[5842.86s -> 5846.06s]  because it can't really no I could be any one of these they're all five
[5846.62s -> 5870.24s]  this is two five where's that one over here probably yes well how you can what
[5870.24s -> 5878.68s]  what's the hashtag guess mmm it could be either one of these because it's
[5878.68s -> 5888.24s]  two is one and then two one two three one two well it has to be one of
[5888.24s -> 5893.56s]  these so that's this one one two three four five block it off got it so
[5893.56s -> 5900.03s]  this has to be two here done therefore that's one two three four five
[5900.03s -> 5905.39s]  therefore that has to be like that therefore here's your one there's your
[5905.39s -> 5915.08s]  two in theory that makes two as well there's your one which makes that
[5915.08s -> 5932.71s]  three which then turns into here it's a grenade I'm gonna get bigger we're
[5932.71s -> 5937.85s]  getting close how was my day my day's been pretty good how was your day
[5937.85s -> 5942.17s]  that's more important how was your day try just get shit face today and like

[5963.48s -> 5972.61s]  gonna do a poll that's stupid one there's you one there's you one there's
[5972.61s -> 5982.99s]  you one there's you one that means so one two look at that oh it's perfect
[5982.99s -> 5987.51s]  you see that did you even see what I did I don't think you did you were
[5987.51s -> 5997.84s]  paying attention this music sucks I'll do another one then okay how about that
[5997.84s -> 6004.71s]  this is super intelligence this is accelerated learning gamma waves for
[6004.71s -> 6018.60s]  focus that was from the gamma waves one there's a game okay wait hold on
[6018.60s -> 6023.31s]  wait oh wait I'm afraid of this is game wages microwave right what's the
[6023.31s -> 6041.93s]  one that's in the microwave microwaves oh right that's right

[6500.18s -> 6505.22s]  gamma ray microwave burrito from like four days ago that's the only pretty
[6505.22s -> 6517.10s]  much possible way did you eat a burrito that you reheated in the
[6517.10s -> 6532.44s]  microwave if the answer is yes then that's probably what happened I've
[6532.44s -> 6538.83s]  never had a burrito in my life how is that possible you've never had a

[6755.64s -> 6783.14s]  the controls now German stocks are way down too I saw that by low they're
[6783.14s -> 6787.22s]  playing against their will their own free will nothing not I could right
[6787.22s -> 6789.86s]  now I could just fuck this whole thing up I could click on every button I

[6809.56s -> 6822.51s]  we've been here for two hours come on it feels way longer feels like less
[6822.51s -> 6833.87s]  than two it feels like way less than two yeah what's the difference between
[6833.87s -> 6843.99s]  p-cross in Sudoku Sudoku is nine grids this is a much larger scale and this
[6843.99s -> 6851.48s]  is more about making a picture than solving a math problem I don't really
[6851.48s -> 6860.14s]  play Sudoku but I think they're yeah they're very different it feels odd
[6860.14s -> 6867.08s]  without the music I'll put something else on hold on how about the royalty
[6867.08s -> 6876.58s]  free old music like what's what's some old music we can put on it's free old
[6876.58s -> 6888.14s]  fashioned free film music no copyright this is the whole line isn't this
[6888.14s -> 6901.00s]  just like a popular song what song is this something made this in
[6901.00s -> 6908.07s]  garage band I know exactly the file name that they used they used high

[9034.22s -> 9039.68s]  was too hot to eat I couldn't eat it I wanted to eat it but for some
[9039.68s -> 9046.91s]  reason I don't know why they do this the Starbucks hot fucking sandwiches are
[9046.91s -> 9055.29s]  ten thousand degrees and you cannot physically eat them until they get too
[9055.29s -> 9070.86s]  cold to throw in the trash I don't throw it in the trash god eight nine

[9118.31s -> 9126.28s]  now good I like that place the I wear to talk about the top two menu
[9126.28s -> 9131.00s]  items is the cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell and the Big Mac from
[9131.00s -> 9141.88s]  McDonald's that is written in like the fucking food Bible somewhere sell
[9141.92s -> 9149.83s]  out no that's that's just written in the food Bible of fast food the cheesy
[9149.83s -> 9153.45s]  gordita crunch is the best single food item you can possibly order from a
[9153.45s -> 9159.76s]  fast food restaurant that's just true I don't have to be sold out for that
[9159.76s -> 9168.62s]  but that's a good ghostbusters is the best movie ever made I don't need
[9168.62s -> 9177.46s]  to tell you that you already know that everybody does and gremlins 2 is
[9177.46s -> 9182.86s]  the second best movie ever made do I need to be paid by Paramount
[9182.86s -> 9192.22s]  pictures to tell you that is it just facts all right three it's one we can
[9192.22s -> 9201.77s]  block these two off for now back to the future three was the best movie
[9201.77s -> 9211.11s]  uh his thing about opinions though you know his thing about opinions
[9211.11s -> 9216.94s]  everybody's got one but only mine matters right and then how most people
[9216.94s -> 9237.54s]  think of opinions these days Paul Blart mall cup is the number one Paul
[9237.54s -> 9244.96s]  Blart ball cup is actually I didn't hate that movie I've never seen it
[9245.00s -> 9260.02s]  but I don't hate it all right you're derelaxing me let's see four four one

[9292.02s -> 9313.62s]  somewhere in here you'll hate it use the X's more often more that's the
[9313.62s -> 9318.61s]  200 IQ strat yeah I use them I only like to use the X's when I'm certain
[9318.61s -> 9325.27s]  though because I don't like it throws me off if I use them too much because
[9325.27s -> 9328.35s]  I didn't like I would use them here but I don't know it could be six and
[9328.35s -> 9338.07s]  then one just don't know okay that's completely done hmm one two three

[9362.14s -> 9373.23s]  maybes hmm that's too many things for me how do you play chat does a puzzle
[9373.23s -> 9391.78s]  every four or five sequences I have it currently turned off to to this way
[9391.78s -> 9400.77s]  would make sense let's say this six this way would make sense to this

[9995.97s -> 10006.20s]  thing on stream yeah that's the German slot machine you don't think I'm
[10006.24s -> 10015.62s]  gonna play that no it's supposed to be let's just don't talk about it

[10051.02s -> 10067.57s]  that two two that would have to be correct right I think so which then has
[10067.57s -> 10080.33s]  one two three yeah that works so far it's my birthday yeah what's the
[10080.33s -> 10084.33s]  latest what's the least acceptable time to eat a bowl of cereal there is

[10135.57s -> 10147.27s]  unhealthy what unhealthy what are you talking about how can you sound
[10147.27s -> 10155.65s]  unhealthy these are probably the ones right because then two would be here
[10155.65s -> 10168.59s]  I'm gonna just do an educated guesser that would make sense to it wouldn't be
[10168.59s -> 10188.70s]  this that's not even a guess that has to be that way whatever or could be no
[10188.70s -> 10195.64s]  well it definitely is not this way no it could be shit all right let me slow
[10195.64s -> 10203.06s]  down slow down slow down I can get this one here this is one one one
[10203.06s -> 10209.04s]  this two where the fuck would this be two going down which means two across
[10209.24s -> 10214.85s]  I don't have enough information I don't have the audio acts critical information
[10214.85s -> 10256.08s]  right that's tough well his three okay I see it I saw it I know somebody was
[10256.08s -> 10265.60s]  yelling at me now here's the real question where's the two you know
[10265.60s -> 10269.52s]  what I'm saying it could be three this way or three that way it could be
[10269.52s -> 10279.83s]  four this way or four this way hmm well it has to be here one of
[10279.87s -> 10306.33s]  these squares is this one I'm screaming into my monitor no I'm gonna accept no
[10306.33s -> 10309.57s]  I'm not doing this I don't want to do the maybe it's too much more
[10309.57s -> 10333.72s]  information I already know well this is three could this be two and then
[10333.72s -> 10340.12s]  one it's very possible but this is one could this could be one and then
[10340.72s -> 10359.30s]  this is one one two three whoa three one two one so therefore nope nope nope
[10359.30s -> 10364.56s]  don't need any of these so it's one of these two bring it down here this is
[10364.56s -> 10381.72s]  one one two one has to be here has to be one two three four five six one two

[10993.28s -> 10998.48s]  and then I'm the reason I'm the reason why you did better on your math
[10998.48s -> 11001.80s]  test in like two weeks and I want you to write at the top of that paper
[11001.80s -> 11006.64s]  you can write your name I would put my name in there too at the top let's
[11006.64s -> 11012.28s]  say your name is Greg Anderson I want you to dash Jeremy Albertson because I
[11012.28s -> 11029.84s]  did it too I helped you do that all right to pause the stream and you go
[11029.84s -> 11034.98s]  get a band-aid what happened what happened what do you mean to get a
[11034.98s -> 11053.12s]  band-aid that's not enough information what happened no you
[11053.12s -> 11057.64s]  probably like just cut his finger on like a toy now what kind of toy
[11057.64s -> 11060.96s]  would that be if you could cut your finger on a toy nothing would get
[11060.96s -> 11070.92s]  recalled is it a toy do we need to get a recall he stepped on a Lego on him
[11070.92s -> 11077.72s]  and threw his foot it's embedded into him all right four five six seven eight
[11077.72s -> 11092.64s]  nine that's not enough resident sleeper resident sleep
[11093.08s -> 11102.42s]  resident sleeper is seriously like so offensive to every stream any stream
[11102.42s -> 11104.42s]  think about how like I want you to think about this for a second but
[11105.26s -> 11112.11s]  like fail fish whatever like he sucks at the game like oh ha ha I made like a
[11112.11s -> 11115.27s]  dumb joke and I didn't think it was funny he's like yeah I was cringy
[11115.27s -> 11120.83s]  resident sleeper means this is so bad I'm falling asleep because this is
[11120.83s -> 11128.14s]  so boring to me that I can't stand it anymore at least you're paying
[11128.14s -> 11132.18s]  attention when you write some of the other ones resident sleeper is
[11132.18s -> 11136.82s]  like holy shit this sucks so bad that I'm going to bed good night I'm
[11136.82s -> 11152.69s]  not even watching anymore and it's in my title yeah all right it's fine all
[11152.69s -> 11161.98s]  right I got one four two two four five six seven eight nine I don't know I
[11161.98s -> 11170.74s]  know I don't know where to start with this one I don't have much to go on
[11170.74s -> 11179.42s]  here this is better than the Wow stream that the Wow stream was the
[11179.42s -> 11186.12s]  lowest point of my entire life that that single Wow stream was the lowest
[11186.12s -> 11192.48s]  single point in the history of my entire adult life but you guys know
[11192.52s -> 11197.32s]  when that stream turned off I smashed everything in my desk I broke every
[11197.32s -> 11201.56s]  monitor I broke all the controllers in here I broke all the glass I put holes
[11201.56s -> 11205.94s]  in all it was like a $16,000 repair job you guys don't know that that
[11205.94s -> 11216.27s]  happened I don't know where this next one goes so that's why I'm stalling
[11216.27s -> 11226.34s]  what will you do after this stream nothing because I'm have this is the
[11226.34s -> 11228.78s]  last dream was fine there was nothing wrong with the Wow stream it
[11228.78s -> 11235.27s]  was fun where does one of these go I've got only one piece of info here
[11235.27s -> 11240.47s]  one one I guess this could be one it has to be so this is one of the ones
[11240.47s -> 11253.88s]  also one of the ones two all I don't know if it's one of the ones four five
[11253.88s -> 11263.68s]  six seven eight nine it's not enough to fill one two three four one no I
[11263.68s -> 11268.40s]  guess it could be but I don't know that though because it could it might
[11268.40s -> 11273.86s]  not be there it's either like that or it's like this I don't have the
[11273.86s -> 11284.07s]  data I can do this though I started drinking in hopes of finding something
[11284.07s -> 11306.84s]  with humor in this string because this is to somewhere so I can go like this
[11306.84s -> 11312.98s]  because it has to be somewhere in here same thing with this one it has to be
[11312.98s -> 11321.52s]  one of these two so I can go like this okay go back to Floyd and
[11321.52s -> 11326.98s]  brothers I blended that disc up and stirred it up with my coffee and
[11326.98s -> 11337.13s]  drank it it was the most painful shit I've ever had in my life why

[11986.40s -> 11988.88s]  off like a big chunk of the chicken and I just like put it in my mouth and
[11988.88s -> 11995.80s]  I let it sit in there cold frozen until the 98.6 degrees temperature at
[11995.80s -> 11999.28s]  Fahrenheit in my mouth warmed it up to a point where I could swallow it
[11999.28s -> 12005.37s]  and I could I kind of like mash it and mush it around in my mouth a
[12005.37s -> 12026.24s]  little bit dance game dance game what kind of curry was it it was a chicken
[12026.24s -> 12032.68s]  curry I don't know 98.6 degrees in mouth that's not natural Fahrenheit
[12032.68s -> 12050.40s]  yes it is 97.5 to like 99 is normal derma 98.6 okay okay okay five six
[12050.40s -> 12062.96s]  seven eight nine I don't have info I don't have any fucking info one have
[12062.96s -> 12080.53s]  this I don't have any info for this I just don't I could I could try to
[12080.53s -> 12085.09s]  determine this so that's the room two three one two three four five is one
[12085.09s -> 12092.94s]  off one two three four five mmm it's probably in here let's see one two
[12092.94s -> 12108.18s]  three or one two three one two three I think I got the three you know for
[12108.18s -> 12114.14s]  the longest time I thought that that emote was the Vinnie's Zelda emote I
[12114.14s -> 12120.84s]  thought it was somebody throwing up into their hand and then I was like oh
[12120.84s -> 12139.86s]  no that's from that cartoon that's from the Phillips CDI game right all
[12139.86s -> 12145.32s]  right come on no that's not Kim texting me back that's like it's like
[12145.32s -> 12159.50s]  my fucking I never mind somebody help me here you're so bored you're
[12159.50s -> 12174.33s]  looking for emotes for fun I am NOT bored I'm just stuck I'm just stuck one two
[12174.33s -> 12183.86s]  three four five one two three I guess it could be here in seven one two three
[12183.86s -> 12193.64s]  four five six seven one two three four five six seven three five two three
[12193.64s -> 12220.48s]  damn it three four five six seven one could be anywhere over here one two
[12220.48s -> 12225.04s]  three four five six seven it could be anywhere the one could be literally any
[12225.04s -> 12231.95s]  of these because this is three and this is also three so it could be either one
[12231.95s -> 12247.20s]  yeah the one can only be here the question is it's I can't I can't
[12247.20s -> 12254.80s]  determine which one it is so therefore one two three four five six seven one
[12254.80s -> 12265.82s]  two three four five six seven doesn't really help me though filling most of
[12265.82s -> 12282.97s]  the seven I'm doing it play English lessons no no no can I teach you how to
[12282.97s -> 12286.09s]  play the game yeah three five one three one three one three one one three two
[12286.09s -> 12288.97s]  five three three one three three one two three four five six seven eight nine
[12288.97s -> 12294.41s]  ten J I H G F E D C B A three five three ten one seven three one two
[12294.41s -> 12300.96s]  three one three one two two one one it's that simple I have to start
[12300.96s -> 12317.87s]  guessing the stream is just a looping back on itself oh hey how'd they go bye
[12317.87s -> 12326.31s]  you don't welcome to the stream all right so we got one two three or one
[12326.31s -> 12334.77s]  two three therefore goodbye no no no no no no no no no no no no no no because
[12334.77s -> 12339.85s]  it has to be either one two three or one two three therefore I think it's
[12339.85s -> 12347.45s]  impossible same on this side because there's no way this three can come up
[12347.45s -> 12354.96s]  this way it's either here here or here I don't have info for down here yet
[12354.96s -> 12374.96s]  brown car note is he finally using crosses I've been using crosses the
[12374.96s -> 12383.63s]  whole time what I've been using these the entire time almost four hours of
[12383.63s -> 12386.07s]  resident sleep or it doesn't even feel like it's been in doubt by the
[12386.07s -> 12390.85s]  way three and a half you're adding time you're adding a like a 40
[12390.85s -> 12393.81s]  minutes of time to make it seem like it's been more boring but it's
[12393.81s -> 12397.53s]  been three eight hours and 27 minutes three hours and ten minutes probably in
[12397.53s -> 12408.77s]  the game you added an extra 45 minutes how is that fair it's called rounding
[12408.77s -> 12414.60s]  up three hours and 27 minutes as you round that up to four no you round that
[12414.60s -> 12423.45s]  down to three three hours and 31 minutes round up the music is bad I'll
[12423.45s -> 12430.60s]  change the music well that make you guys happy he's there the music the
[12430.60s -> 12447.40s]  music is kind of round to the nearest hour okay how about I'm not
[12447.40s -> 12452.93s]  gonna play the brown note look this thing says warning the real brown note
[12452.93s -> 12459.20s]  brown frequency by the way it's by the YouTube channel apex legends clips

[12522.97s -> 12528.01s]  be a low sounding frequency noise I would mute the stream for the next 30
[12528.01s -> 12533.84s]  seconds okay mute now want to make sure you have enough warning here

[14953.90s -> 14959.73s]  three four five one two three four five it can't be
[14959.73s -> 14981.73s]  certain can't be certain don't guess
[14981.73s -> 14986.21s]  one two three four five one two three four five

[15165.90s -> 15180.78s]  i don't know if this is the first one or the second one i don't know if
[15180.78s -> 15184.94s]  this is because this could be one let's see
[15184.94s -> 15189.49s]  could it be one one two three four five no this has
[15189.49s -> 15192.85s]  to be part of the five so this has to be one right here it
[15192.85s -> 15197.14s]  has to be right because there's no way that that can be
[15197.14s -> 15211.68s]  the one one two three four five that should be good one this is also
[15211.68s -> 15222.48s]  one there it is okay looking for a two

[15274.05s -> 15292.59s]  there i could pay attention that's one one would be this would
[15292.59s -> 15305.55s]  make sense in either one of these two spaces so i don't know
[15305.55s -> 15310.24s]  five six seven eight
[15311.76s -> 15323.74s]  all right that's done so it was here where does that leave

[15421.17s -> 15434.91s]  20 by 20 they're locked wait okay i don't want to know what these are
[15434.91s -> 15443.25s]  all right here's the 50 by 50 we can't do 20 by 20 we have to
[15443.25s -> 15455.04s]  fuck that guy i swear uh okay we'll do accessories 15 by 15
[15455.04s -> 15460.48s]  but this one's are what i don't know come on you don't give that to me this
[15460.48s -> 15463.04s]  is like 10 by 10 you took it away from me
[15463.04s -> 15469.14s]  that's the most exciting thing to happen in hours one two three four
[15469.14s -> 15472.98s]  five six seven one two three four five six seven
[15472.98s -> 15481.01s]  one two three four five six seven okay we're not going for excitement
[15481.01s -> 15491.49s]  we're going for ingenuity uh how the fuck am i going to do this one four
[15491.49s -> 15501.07s]  five six seven let us do one guy i said the re word
[15501.07s -> 15512.93s]  three one two three four five six one two three four five six
[15514.69s -> 15522.74s]  okay i've got two here now five one two
[15522.74s -> 15526.02s]  three four five get out of here look at that
[15526.02s -> 15539.09s]  oh that's good four could be right here
[15539.09s -> 15543.87s]  four two seven right in the middle there okay
[15543.87s -> 15560.75s]  is this minesweeper not quite six let's see one two three four five
[15560.75s -> 15574.42s]  no one two three four five it's probably one of these two
[15574.42s -> 15578.50s]  three let's see one two three one two three so this is all
[15578.50s -> 15584.86s]  bullshit same with this say one two three four
[15584.86s -> 15591.94s]  one two three one two three four so this is all bullshit up here one
[15591.94s -> 15596.74s]  two three four five one two three four five one two
[15596.74s -> 15603.68s]  three four five all bullshit no wait one two three four five
[15603.68s -> 15607.04s]  one two three four five what's wrong with my voice
[15607.04s -> 15619.71s]  okay three going up and down three going up and down again but i don't
[15619.71s -> 15623.71s]  know if it's connected to here it might be one two three four five
[15623.71s -> 15633.79s]  six seven no i can't tell six is though it's
[15633.79s -> 15640.54s]  possible one two three four one two three four therefore all
[15640.54s -> 15648.30s]  this is dog shit one two three four five six one two
[15648.30s -> 15651.90s]  three four five six all this is dog shit
[15651.90s -> 15669.90s]  derma sucks well everybody's got an opinion you know
[15669.90s -> 15675.01s]  four two can't tell i don't have any info yet
[15675.01s -> 15687.74s]  two and then two let's think about this for a second
[15687.74s -> 15693.26s]  five one two three four five one two three four five
[15693.26s -> 15700.69s]  that's right one two three four five one two three four five that's correct
[15700.69s -> 15703.98s]  then here's the real issue is this part of the four
[15703.98s -> 15724.53s]  or is this four and this two one two three four
[15724.53s -> 15733.49s]  one two three four okay is that part of the four or is this four too
[15733.49s -> 15744.30s]  i don't know you should try the quit puzzle game i'm not gonna do that one
[15744.30s -> 15749.18s]  two three four five six one two three four five six
[15749.18s -> 15755.79s]  that makes sense which means three four
[15755.79s -> 15760.35s]  one two three four one two three four
[15760.35s -> 15765.89s]  one two three four one two three four it's not there
[15765.89s -> 15783.39s]  damn it one two three one two three it's not here
[15783.39s -> 15805.49s]  one two three one okay nice two three seven there's the six
[15805.49s -> 15808.45s]  six again okay there's the four the two
[15808.45s -> 15817.62s]  oh it's just cascades like a domino that's what you say
[15817.62s -> 15825.22s]  chill out dude it's an accessory you guys are guessing animals
[15825.22s -> 15832.19s]  it's not it's not a this is not a whale
[15832.19s -> 15835.55s]  well it's got to be here or here therefore none of this works
[15835.55s -> 15854.46s]  one two three one two three four that's it for three
[15854.46s -> 15857.66s]  i don't like men under five feet sorry well that's great because i'm
[15857.66s -> 15862.32s]  five eight so no that's not true here no no no no no no no no i'm talking
[15862.32s -> 15867.92s]  about like this that's not real this is not going to work for none
[15867.92s -> 15873.78s]  of five feet
[15884.96s -> 15888.96s]  one two three one two three can't be here
[15891.42s -> 15896.67s]  two i'm gonna i know what this i'm gonna guess i think this is a
[15896.67s -> 15903.46s]  pipe a smoking pipe jerma only reads mean comments so we feel bad and give him
[15903.46s -> 15911.71s]  money one two three one two three can't be here
[15911.71s -> 15927.50s]  what is this two two three four five six one two three four five six perfect

[15933.73s -> 15946.53s]  three excellent two two three two three
[15946.53s -> 15955.38s]  i told you it was a pipe oh my god a cheeto
[15955.38s -> 15967.02s]  okay remember this is 15 by 15 10 doesn't do anything for us anymore
[15967.02s -> 15978.62s]  so we can do 12 13 so it's like this because that's one
[15978.62s -> 15982.86s]  two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[15982.86s -> 15987.18s]  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[15987.18s -> 15992.94s]  wait a second no that's fine because that's 12 13 14 15 i
[15992.94s -> 16004.66s]  guess it could be either way because it does he buffoon yeah still
[16004.66s -> 16007.06s]  not a real board yeah they're giving us
[16007.06s -> 16011.87s]  they're giving us like the slow drip here therefore 10 would be
[16011.87s -> 16015.87s]  how many how many down is this one two three four five six seven eight
[16015.87s -> 16020.43s]  nine ten eleven twelve thirteen okay so the middle
[16020.43s -> 16025.02s]  ten here so that would be like in here
[16025.02s -> 16028.62s]  let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[16028.62s -> 16035.94s]  one two three same deal here eight nine
[16035.94s -> 16043.97s]  ten can't really do much with that but we do know this is eight
[16043.97s -> 16047.25s]  and this why is it why wouldn't they fill this one in they filled all the
[16047.25s -> 16051.81s]  other ones in why not this one well that just made everything way
[16051.81s -> 16057.07s]  easier because now i can go one two three four five six seven eight
[16057.07s -> 16069.79s]  one two three four five six seven eight so that's can't be that can't be over
[16069.79s -> 16073.06s]  here actually none of these can be over here
[16073.06s -> 16080.03s]  wait yeah yeah this yeah yeah one could still be here
[16080.03s -> 16089.68s]  that one could be right here it probably is let's see
[16089.68s -> 16101.12s]  six one two three four five six two three four five six and that's
[16101.12s -> 16103.36s]  reaching i don't know if that's true or not
[16103.44s -> 16109.94s]  it's reaching two three four five six seven eight
[16109.94s -> 16119.15s]  two three four five six seven eight all right there's the ten there's the
[16119.15s -> 16122.75s]  ten close that looks pretty good now we
[16122.75s -> 16128.03s]  got twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[16128.03s -> 16138.11s]  still don't know do something funny no i'm gonna do something funny let me
[16138.11s -> 16141.71s]  talk about one two three four one two three four
[16141.79s -> 16151.04s]  these two that's the two there here's the three
[16151.04s -> 16158.82s]  there's your six make do funny funny something funny
[16158.82s -> 16163.23s]  now it's not all about fun and games it's not all about funny
[16163.23s -> 16184.43s]  sometimes it's about just relaxing eight five six eight so there you go
[16184.43s -> 16190.40s]  i want a joke i want a joke there are no jokes
[16190.40s -> 16212.72s]  let me see what we got here four the ones are gonna be tricky
[16213.04s -> 16220.90s]  brown note sapped him of all is funny i thought sapped well i'm just having a
[16220.90s -> 16227.26s]  good time that's all that i had that you know
[16227.26s -> 16231.18s]  well it's very clear that one two three four
[16231.18s -> 16237.98s]  one two three four so this is nothing one two three four one two three four
[16237.98s -> 16241.58s]  so these are this middle here so it has to be one two three four five
[16241.58s -> 16256.98s]  four five excellent excellent i jumped into my favorite streamer stream after
[16256.98s -> 16259.86s]  a long day at work extremely tired to see him playing a boomer game
[16259.86s -> 16264.58s]  also why wasn't saturn on the t-shirt care to explain
[16264.58s -> 16281.49s]  because they're standing on saturn but how do i need to explain that
[16281.49s -> 16286.64s]  by the way if you don't know i have merchandise t-shirts
[16286.64s -> 16290.40s]  30 days old just about the night sky t-shirt and glue man had made a
[16290.40s -> 16295.42s]  return if you do hashtag shirts you're gonna
[16295.42s -> 16300.74s]  find the store and maybe you'll buy one if you want
[16300.74s -> 16305.22s]  there's no reason to unless you want the shirt and want to be involved in the
[16305.22s -> 16308.75s]  cool shirt club all right hold on what is this
[16308.75s -> 16320.69s]  can't be there one two three four can't be here and it can't be here
[16320.69s -> 16325.25s]  two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight
[16325.25s -> 16330.00s]  cool there's the one excellent narrow it down in here too one two
[16330.00s -> 16334.32s]  three four five six one two three four five six nice
[16334.32s -> 16342.58s]  did that give me anything else that gave me the three that means nothing
[16342.58s -> 16354.70s]  over there nothing over here there it is i still
[16354.70s -> 16369.20s]  don't know about that i do know that though okay so that's
[16369.20s -> 16374.40s]  close enough one two three four five six seven eight
[16375.68s -> 16385.84s]  i guess it could be either one of these one yeah could be all right
[16385.84s -> 16393.20s]  almost done with this one but we should have clicked on that white box
[16393.20s -> 16402.51s]  yep no no no no no there's still a one here
[16402.51s -> 16411.34s]  it's either this one or this one how the hell would i know
[16411.34s -> 16414.78s]  one two three four five six seven eight one
[16414.78s -> 16441.34s]  no that's not true i got the eight 12 eight possible um i don't like that
[16441.34s -> 16450.56s]  i mean it's got to be here right there's that has to be
[16450.56s -> 16460.14s]  look at how perfect that is i fucked up something what did i fuck up

[16673.57s -> 16688.19s]  that's correct uh that that was not auto
[16688.19s -> 16693.31s]  that's not even how moons work look at that here's the best part
[16693.31s -> 16700.13s]  this is like peeling off a bandaid after it's been on there for like
[16700.13s -> 16712.74s]  four days oh that's good this whole column is

[16740.06s -> 16744.14s]  actually that took away like 40 of the whole board okay
[16744.14s -> 16751.28s]  so this is a lighting something to do with lighting
[16751.28s -> 16757.60s]  any other places i didn't fill in there's a two somewhere there's a five

[17493.12s -> 17510.61s]  f7 gets filled in and removed i'm still here i ain't going anywhere yet i'm
[17510.61s -> 17525.92s]  curious how this plays out we got we got a lot of we got a lot of
[17525.92s -> 17532.90s]  people in complete anarchy we got we need some people to come in here
[17532.90s -> 17536.62s]  and really take control and work as a team and get this done
[17536.62s -> 17542.67s]  and to drown out all the people that are just
[17542.67s -> 17557.84s]  trying to make it hell read bits while chat kills your channel
[17557.84s -> 17561.54s]  i'm not i'm not leaving yet i'm not turning i'm not
[17561.54s -> 17586.02s]  leaving stream's on over oh oh oh play sad music well i heard an
[17586.02s -> 17621.50s]  entire row wildly enough look at that we got three in the
[17621.50s -> 17625.23s]  middle i don't think that's the right place
[17625.23s -> 17655.55s]  might be add a timer to the screen there yeah there is a timer isn't it
[17655.55s -> 17668.16s]  already on we actually can't the row and column
[17668.16s -> 17683.90s]  fills are too strong do a long slow mode check the
[17683.90s -> 17699.58s]  settings come on pause show time there you go
[17699.58s -> 17719.17s]  13 and a half minutes almost 14 minutes 14 minutes and then no progress
[17719.17s -> 17721.97s]  i think i actually probably put it on a slow mode a certain
[17721.97s -> 17733.70s]  right turn off the rows and columns i don't think i can do that
[17733.70s -> 17739.50s]  see i can't fill a1 fill i can't turn them off
[17739.50s -> 17762.13s]  click them no it doesn't do anything turn off twitch integration i think i
[17762.13s -> 17770.18s]  think you guys can do it play brain power what is brain power
[17776.00s -> 17787.58s]  brain power this this is too fast too fast too much too no no too fast and too
[17787.58s -> 17798.54s]  upbeat how's it going we got still in the same spot

[20125.84s -> 20132.91s]  welcome andrew thanks for staying we fuck around a lot here but it's all
[20132.91s -> 20141.12s]  in good fun welcome i don't know any of this
[20141.12s -> 20148.85s]  although two and in space let's just say it starts here one two three four five
[20148.85s -> 20152.83s]  six seven one two three one two i guess it
[20152.83s -> 20154.83s]  could it's got to be some of these in the middle here the five in the
[20154.83s -> 20157.42s]  middle that's a guess but it's i think it's
[20157.42s -> 20164.67s]  worth a shot what a shitty first stream to watch
[20164.67s -> 20169.34s]  what's wrong with this i like this stream i thought this is fun
[20169.34s -> 20180.64s]  that's that is five four is probably four
[20180.64s -> 20204.35s]  then that's six okay that's either that's probably two
[20204.35s -> 20209.07s]  two one two three i think that works i think that's good but what about the
[20209.07s -> 20214.85s]  middle here one five three two is this five or is this the space
[20214.85s -> 20218.61s]  in between where the three is one two three one two
[20218.61s -> 20222.13s]  because then that would be one two three four
[20222.13s -> 20229.20s]  five i'm liking it i'm liking it so far i'm liking it
[20229.20s -> 20238.46s]  two two again that was a perfect co-op really was
[20238.46s -> 20251.70s]  got that one all right two three four five
[20251.70s -> 20267.92s]  oh fuck shit this doesn't work no no no no no no no no it's already
[20267.92s -> 20280.00s]  screwed up one four this works though this is okay i
[20280.00s -> 20294.51s]  think skeleton fruit if you had the cheat
[20294.51s -> 20297.47s]  sheet this wouldn't be hard i'm not gonna use the cheat sheet
[20299.26s -> 20307.78s]  it has to be here if that's not correct then i've got more problems
[20307.78s -> 20320.72s]  that's all seven three okay it is the five in the middle so it's three again
[20320.72s -> 20324.61s]  one two three four five does that work though
[20324.61s -> 20329.97s]  one two three fuck one two three four five does
[20329.97s -> 20340.91s]  that's five one two one three is left you got the two then you got the
[20340.91s -> 20345.07s]  three i think it's currently working out
[20345.07s -> 20354.66s]  this three two three this looks really messed up but i think i got it
[20354.66s -> 20375.70s]  three three again then that's five no this is good okay it's sands
[20375.70s -> 20378.66s]  i don't know about that cv and then we need six one
[20378.66s -> 20401.30s]  two three four oh no it's fucking wrong that's correct that's correct
[20401.30s -> 20408.14s]  but i don't know three and then three now that's correct there's your two
[20408.14s -> 20410.94s]  i need a four in here somewhere what the
[20410.94s -> 20426.64s]  ah where's the four is this the four no one two
[20426.64s -> 20437.98s]  four one two three i think this is the four right here two
[20437.98s -> 20449.65s]  no this is the four right here okay hold on
[20449.65s -> 20460.45s]  it's 15 minutes are up i didn't have any stakes there were no stakes put on
[20460.45s -> 20473.22s]  here two what is the two three four five
[20473.22s -> 20485.33s]  two seven three there it is two but that's two two
[20485.33s -> 20494.16s]  and then one two three four five six one one two three four five one two
[20494.16s -> 20500.37s]  three four five six got it is that two
[20500.37s -> 20519.15s]  done yes what is it orange you guys got it i don't know we'll do one more one
[20519.15s -> 20522.03s]  more one more one more one more one more this is a big one
[20522.03s -> 20530.16s]  13 14 15 so that's one then fill the whole thing in
[20530.16s -> 20539.87s]  and craft same thing over here 13 and then one
[20539.87s -> 20545.28s]  there's a lot of these big ones okay so now
[20545.28s -> 20550.83s]  i got both edges here that's great one
[20550.83s -> 20567.02s]  one two three five some type of staircase it's a weapon
[20567.02s -> 20577.47s]  not exactly sure what kind of weapon looks like this it's the one
[20577.47s -> 20596.56s]  two three that's too many five six i love these ones what the
[20596.56s -> 20603.95s]  hell is this it's a weird looking weapon is it
[20603.95s -> 20606.51s]  the negative space here that i'm supposed to be looking at
[20606.51s -> 20617.26s]  okay so let's take a look what we got we got two
[20617.34s -> 20627.26s]  six and then two four two four five four one two three four one
[20627.26s -> 20635.22s]  not quite same deal here two two one two
[20635.22s -> 20642.67s]  one one two three four not quite one two three four five six seven eight
[20642.67s -> 20645.39s]  nine one two three four five six seven eight
[20645.39s -> 20652.67s]  nine two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine good
[20652.67s -> 20678.75s]  one two three block it two block it one one okay so that's probably the one one of the ones
[20679.79s -> 20692.51s]  can't be four can it one no okay have i played bob ross pickross i've not i played a lot of
[20692.51s -> 20702.51s]  these different kinds of pickross games not that one though well it has to be in here so
[20702.51s -> 20715.94s]  one two three four five one two three four five and we got three i'm relaxed right now
[20715.94s -> 20730.50s]  i feel fucking great really i can do this way too so it's one two three four one two three four
[20732.43s -> 20738.83s]  should be one two three four five one two three four five six seven eight nine two three four
[20738.83s -> 20741.55s]  five six seven eight nine we've got some things to fill in here there's three
[20747.07s -> 20768.48s]  fill it in play the brown note again i can't i can't that's too much all right now is that
[20768.48s -> 20775.66s]  there's one there one two three four somewhere in the middle here and then one there's another
[20775.66s -> 20782.46s]  one above here because that's not one two three four no that has to be one so there's a four
[20782.54s -> 20786.22s]  somewhere in the middle here one two three four one two three four bingo
[20787.26s -> 20798.40s]  okay this is part of the four so one two three four one two one two three four one two three
[20798.40s -> 20816.91s]  four three nothing else down there no this is part of the five two three four five one two
[20816.91s -> 20826.59s]  three four five i can't deduce it from here look over three one so if it's right here
[20827.39s -> 20834.59s]  space one two three one two three has to be right here at least one of them one and there's
[20834.59s -> 20850.58s]  your three right there completed thank you up guess streamer sucks what's that right so looking
[20850.58s -> 20856.34s]  for a one and then the three looking for five in the middle one two three four five one two three
[20856.34s -> 20863.81s]  four five one two three four five one two three all right getting a little weird here i gotta slow
[20863.81s -> 20874.42s]  down this is part of the four that's it for this what if there's four in here too one two three four
[20874.42s -> 20882.70s]  one two three four one two three four one two three four okay it's part of the six in here
[20882.70s -> 20898.22s]  deduce deduce deduce deduce deduce so that means three this is six two three four five
[20898.78s -> 20911.44s]  one two three four five six one two three four five six looking good this is the one
[20912.32s -> 20918.42s]  this is the three one two three one two three has to be here here's the two here's the one
[20919.06s -> 20926.77s]  there's another one and the five is back here two three four one two three four
[20927.57s -> 20962.98s]  two three okay two four oh it's wrong now it's wrong what does i fucking do two two two two
[20963.86s -> 20979.12s]  okay one two three four two two one has to be here don't tell me he's been playing this for
[20979.12s -> 20997.98s]  six hours yeah it's fun hold on let me go down here got six two one two three four five six one
[20997.98s -> 21015.31s]  two three four five six i need one more two four one one probably here i got too much shit going
[21015.31s -> 21023.84s]  on here blink twice if you're being held captive no never mind i'm not gonna do that
[21024.32s -> 21047.39s]  um this is part of the five so therefore well this is definitely not here one two three four
[21047.39s -> 21056.03s]  five okay that's two right there is this going is this going the right direction it might be
[21057.50s -> 21064.14s]  one two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine
[21065.92s -> 21084.80s]  all right close very close one four one two three four one two three four two three four
[21088.02s -> 21108.77s]  uh hold on hold on one one four one there it is which leads to this is done it's right here
[21108.77s -> 21121.46s]  right yeah so then we got this is uh oh no four and then four that's one two one two
[21124.67s -> 21141.26s]  yes bow and arrow who got it well it's actually just bow only bow nothing else all right this
[21141.26s -> 21150.08s]  last one this is that last one last one last one last one this final one it is a minecraft
[21150.08s -> 21158.67s]  sprite this is it final puzzle of the night it was fun this is a really relaxing interesting
[21158.67s -> 21162.27s]  game p cross i hope you learned it hope you figured out how to do it and hope you play it
[21162.27s -> 21166.03s]  because it's very fun interesting and really uh moves your brain all right here we go final
[21166.03s -> 21190.54s]  puzzle as you nine so then that gives us two okay not very much to go on one two three four
[21190.54s -> 21200.91s]  five six seven yep seven seven fourteen fifteen there you go this is nine a ten of course
[21201.79s -> 21217.36s]  so let's see from here one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five
[21217.36s -> 21227.15s]  six seven eight nineteen now this is this works because it already started up here
[21227.15s -> 21243.94s]  that's fine three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine
[21244.74s -> 21253.55s]  it's two two two two they're all twos one two three four five six
[21254.43s -> 21265.74s]  and eight which brings us to this two of all this three in the middle here one two three
[21266.86s -> 21279.33s]  one one no eight and one maybe let's see one two three four this could be the one
[21279.97s -> 21285.09s]  let's see if this is the one one two three four five six seven eight yeah it could be the one
[21286.78s -> 21297.38s]  just don't know there's still enough room for it to be the one 12 is right here though so one
[21297.38s -> 21303.62s]  two three like this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two
[21305.86s -> 21318.66s]  what does that do for us that's one they're all ones okay and we'll big numbers
[21319.38s -> 21336.10s]  i don't see any this does narrow this down though one two three two two one two two so
[21336.10s -> 21346.72s]  this could be here oh it has to be because of those two cool and this also is two two
[21347.44s -> 21357.98s]  so now i know and this has to be two oh yes oh yes thank goodness
[21358.78s -> 21367.50s]  is three oh this is great go go go go this is perfect ready one two three one two three
[21367.50s -> 21374.75s]  all this is done you know what that means get rid of this get rid of this get rid of this
[21376.16s -> 21383.12s]  and that is down here and there it is so this was the eight right here so that's good
[21383.84s -> 21397.79s]  let's put it up there let's see what that did two one that's another one same thing this one
[21397.79s -> 21410.83s]  this is just a completed row two one one three nice completed two one one three again

[21616.24s -> 21622.96s]  to be the eight here has to be right one two three four five six seven eight and that's got
[21622.96s -> 21635.44s]  to be here all these are the eights and the seven and the six what no this is a photography

[24258.72s -> 24267.66s]  earlier the stream fiti gave five tier three community subs that's a lot of money tier three
[24267.66s -> 24276.48s]  is insanely expensive especially giving five of them away so thanks a lot tod florid thank
[24276.48s -> 24284.00s]  you for the 280 minesweeper is better it's just a different game joel calmed down and

[24315.82s -> 24329.63s]  lesson you know i think i think the six and a half hour pick cross stream was enough hey
[24329.71s -> 24335.97s]  fiti thanks for the 15 dollars on top of your five tier three subs sorry can you explain the
[24335.97s -> 24340.29s]  game again that was a little quick for me hopefully six hours later you figured it out
[24340.29s -> 24344.37s]  it's pretty easy but kind of difficult you kind of just need to know what's going on
[24347.81s -> 24352.29s]  war void thanks for the five dollars war void i enjoyed that thanos with a stroke impression
[24352.85s -> 24362.64s]  that was so long ago i forgot i forgot even doing that derma lied about minecraft vr and
[24362.64s -> 24367.15s]  somebody's username i'm doing minecraft vr i told you that was still happening
[24369.44s -> 24375.98s]  i'm still doing that your username is is completely irrelevant i'm going to play
[24375.98s -> 24388.19s]  minecraft in vr i never said i wasn't doing that topac thanks for the three bucks topac
[24389.01s -> 24393.17s]  not sure if you spoke about this already but any word on why save was removed is unfortunate
[24393.17s -> 24399.07s]  to kill the off-stream chat uh i kind of wanted to clean up the off-stream chat a little
[24399.07s -> 24403.87s]  bit i think a lot of people were kind of just putting commands in and there's some i think
[24403.87s -> 24408.91s]  there was a couple people that had like scripts or something to like just run in the offline
[24408.91s -> 24416.03s]  chat i'd rather just people be able to talk and it was an old kind of meme old joke from
[24416.03s -> 24424.02s]  more than almost a year or two ago he saved them all there they were like there was you
[24424.02s -> 24433.17s]  saved 73 000 seagulls you saved every seagull on earth why not let it reach 100 000
[24433.17s -> 24449.15s]  because there's not 100 000 seagulls on earth there's only 73 428 you got them all the zoo
[24449.15s -> 24459.33s]  is packed yeah there was too many seagulls in that zoo but i cleaned up some commands
[24460.69s -> 24467.20s]  there's you know i'm just doing just doing a cleanup of kind of nightbot commands random
[24467.20s -> 24483.02s]  bot commands but that's pretty much the reason why talk about the game oh yeah i did act
[24483.82s -> 24489.28s]  not that's not necessarily to counteract the fact that i got rid of that but i turned on that
[24489.28s -> 24495.33s]  streamer legends game it's that like idling rpg game where you get loot and you fight together
[24496.21s -> 24499.49s]  i figured maybe something with like offline chat or before a stream starts might be
[24499.49s -> 24502.93s]  worth just playing around and being able to talk about and hang out i know some other
[24502.93s -> 24511.20s]  streamers have it on figured it would just something to just have you can pop it out
[24511.20s -> 24516.56s]  you can play it there's oh what the fuck i'm what i gotta give the loot i gotta give i'm
[24516.56s -> 24520.88s]  only gonna do this once i'm not i'm gonna okay by the way i still had jules stream up
[24522.08s -> 24528.91s]  uh i could give people loot right now hold on if you have it open right now uh i'm gonna give
[24528.91s -> 24536.58s]  you like a treasure chest i'm definitely not gonna do this all the time because i'll forget
[24536.58s -> 24551.39s]  every day all right you ready here it comes send gifts bingo well it's just something fun
[24551.39s -> 24558.22s]  to have this doesn't cost any money or anything it's just there if you want to play
[24558.22s -> 24567.09s]  with it you get gold for killing monsters and you can contribute together as a community
[24568.13s -> 24575.04s]  to upgrade the barracks and upgrade the base it's just like a little dinky rpg game
[24575.60s -> 24587.42s]  but it's just gonna be there what's it called they're called stream legends stream legends

[24598.06s -> 24604.64s]  can you move it further up so we can watch the stream here's the thing you can pop that window
[24604.64s -> 24609.87s]  out that window has a pop out you can put it anywhere you want on any monitor on any page

[24652.37s -> 24657.55s]  joe that he had 20 iq i don't know if that was true or not i'm just remember manipulation

[25114.48s -> 25119.28s]  however the one thing i hated was how every fifth pedestrian in the city spat out a cloud
[25119.28s -> 25124.48s]  of either cigar smoke or weed on my face and i got a little obnoxious very fun trip regardless
[25124.48s -> 25134.43s]  seems like a nice place to live too uh it is yeah i mean i think i mean those also might be

[25144.53s -> 25148.77s]  that i'm not going to do that i thought was potentially funny spoiler alert for like a
[25148.77s -> 25153.41s]  future stream that's not going to happen because i like axed it i was going to play fortnight
[25153.41s -> 25162.46s]  in a tank top and just have loud blasting music have kind of like a odd weird shitty
[25162.46s -> 25166.94s]  camera setup just ripping a fucking vape pen just like

[25173.04s -> 25178.48s]  is over the course of about an hour or two i have like four fog machines that are slowly
[25178.48s -> 25189.18s]  going to be used and turned on until the whole room is filled with fog and there is
[25189.18s -> 25199.07s]  no joke that's that's the whole joke like i just i just turn my head like this i go like

[25219.79s -> 25236.43s]  where we dropping for like fucking two straight hours and eventually the smoke alarm was going
[25236.43s -> 25246.48s]  to go off like and i was going to keep playing for like another 30 minutes and then
[25246.48s -> 25264.45s]  eventually the stream was just going to turn off without me saying bye now i'm sad that it
[25264.45s -> 25269.22s]  didn't happen well i was going to do it in the studio i wasn't going to do it like here
[25278.10s -> 25283.86s]  why was it cancelled you want to be honest because i was going to have to play fortnight

[25304.11s -> 25313.52s]  dress-up joke stream in a while maybe i'll still do it just don't tell anybody hey

[25603.42s -> 25605.10s]  so
[25606.30s -> 25612.14s]  okay you know when you give a small child a microphone set like a three-year-old for
