[0.82s -> 9.35s]  Ah yes, Super Frog. Hi guys. We're a little early, yeah. I want to start early because
[9.35s -> 17.02s]  this stream, I'm not going to have very much time today. If you don't know, this stream is the last
[17.02s -> 27.37s]  stream you're going to get for a small but significant amount of time. After today's stream,
[27.37s -> 37.26s]  you will not see me again until Friday of next week. I'm not going to be here for about five or
[37.26s -> 44.84s]  six straight days. Part of the reason why I wanted to do five plus days in a row here.
[45.40s -> 52.23s]  I'm supposed to start in 30 minutes. Yeah, I was starting early because I don't have,
[53.19s -> 61.53s]  um, I have until about four to five hours from right now. So I wanted to really start and get
[61.53s -> 74.76s]  going. What are we supposed to do for that time? I recommend read the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[76.42s -> 80.90s]  It'll take you a week and then you can come back to me and say, hey, I've read it all.
[84.39s -> 89.35s]  Actually, that'd probably take longer. That actually would probably take a couple months.
[90.07s -> 93.03s]  So I'm not, I'm not leaving for a couple months. I'm leaving for about a week.
[95.51s -> 109.45s]  Less, a little less than a week. What a waste of time. Oh man, you guys really don't like reading.
[109.45s -> 116.73s]  But, uh, the plan today is to try and continue our hardcore Diablo 2 adventure.
[118.50s -> 125.53s]  If you've missed the last two or two or three times we've done this, we are standing outside
[125.53s -> 134.58s]  of Diablo's area. So Diablo is within 20 minutes of where we are right now.
[136.15s -> 147.00s]  And we have the skeleton crew trying to fight Diablo. So, uh, if this stream turns out to be
[148.42s -> 155.90s]  40 minutes long because I die to Diablo because I'm not prepared for it, we'll do something else.
[155.90s -> 164.28s]  But the plan is to try to stay alive and to get into act five and keep going. We'll see.
[165.08s -> 171.50s]  Don't flatter yourself. I feel like it'll take, it'll take 40 minutes to even get to him
[171.50s -> 185.82s]  because of how our character is currently built. The plan is simple. Yeah, if, if I die
[185.82s -> 194.34s]  in Diablo, the Asura's Wrath DLC is the plan. But I don't plan on dying in Diablo. I plan on playing
[194.34s -> 208.92s]  for at least a few hours. Here comes the flush force. For the love of God, please do not die.
[211.02s -> 216.49s]  We have an interesting chat today, I think, because a bunch of people in chat might want me to die
[216.49s -> 221.69s]  because they want to see Asura's Wrath really bad. They get the DLC there, but there are also
[221.69s -> 227.05s]  a bunch of people that don't want to see the Asura's Wrath DLC and they're like, no, I don't,
[227.05s -> 234.04s]  I don't want that. I will. I please stay alive in Diablo. It's going to be an interesting day.
[235.00s -> 240.98s]  There's a civil war here. All right, let's, uh, we've waited long enough. It's been about five
[240.98s -> 243.70s]  minutes. Let's get into it. Hope you're having a good day. If you missed yesterday's stream.
[244.74s -> 248.58s]  Well, yeah, technically yesterday. Tony Hawk's Underground was a lot of fun.
[250.76s -> 264.25s]  Let's try to kill Diablo. I'm almost level 30. So I got to get a refresher here. Oh, that's right.
[264.25s -> 272.07s]  We did Raal Raal. Probably the worst thing ever. I made stealth. I don't really have very good
[272.07s -> 280.39s]  items, do I? My items are kind of terrible. All right. I'm going to die in the first five minutes.
[280.39s -> 288.47s]  I know. Hey, get, get, get your Asura's, Asura's Wrath DLC hype ready in the chat, boys and girls,
[288.95s -> 297.53s]  because I'm probably dead in 10 minutes. I need a skeleton crew to refresh your memory. Here is
[297.53s -> 305.96s]  where chat has decided to put the points. We have a lot in Iron Golem. I'm going to make sure you
[305.96s -> 309.48s]  just give a quick little refresher course. It's been about a week and a half since you've seen
[309.48s -> 319.42s]  this. Ray skeleton, skeleton mastery. You've gone down into the, you've gone down into the Golems.
[320.54s -> 327.77s]  Iron Golem members. Iron Golem gives synergy, 20 attack rating per level to all Golems.
[327.77s -> 335.21s]  You put points into skeleton mage. We are about to unlock in, if I'm to stay alive, that is we're
[335.21s -> 350.09s]  about to unlock fireman or revive. All of these are very good. Fire Golem or revive. Revive just
[350.09s -> 358.25s]  lets you bring any character back to life. That's not a boss. So if one of those big demon guys dies,
[358.25s -> 367.82s]  I can bring them back to life and I can do this. Um, like you can have like 20, I think monsters
[367.82s -> 374.90s]  out at once. I feel like there's going to be a fight here. Uh, thanks for the two teeth. It was
[374.90s -> 382.66s]  a waste of a point. People thought it was funny. I mean, I laughed. It was pretty funny and then
[382.66s -> 386.34s]  amplify damage. Obviously if you don't put a one point and amplify damage as a necromancer, I mean,
[386.34s -> 391.72s]  what the hell are you doing? So that about does it. We have this guy here. We have, uh, Vic is
[391.72s -> 404.17s]  still with us. Vic, uh, by the way, Vic has better gear than I do because the, uh, the real hero here.
[404.17s -> 415.18s]  So let's do river of flame. I'm, I think I'm ready. I didn't even get it. I didn't wait. Did I not
[415.18s -> 428.30s]  step on the waypoint? Did I not step on the waypoint last time? No, I did. Didn't I? Didn't we
[428.30s -> 435.96s]  get to the river of flame and I like stepped on the waypoint? Did I? That's a big oops. Oh shit.
[435.96s -> 445.40s]  That's actually really bad. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Now I got here.
[445.40s -> 451.51s]  Yep. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay. We're good. They were, I didn't get to the waypoint. I did the,
[451.51s -> 460.98s]  uh, the gems. All right. I gotta be careful. This is probably going to be a quick one. So what
[460.98s -> 466.55s]  happened to Sir's wrath so far? The story, uh, you're one of the eight deities or you were until
[466.55s -> 478.33s]  you were cast away from all, from there's seven of them now. Nah, we'll be fine. Let me get my
[478.33s -> 485.22s]  skeleton crew up and we'll be good to go. My man, I have such shit, man. All right. We're going to
[485.22s -> 493.90s]  have five regular skeletons and we can add three majors. I believe I've got the whole crew. Uh,
[493.90s -> 502.66s]  we need to amplify damage. All right. I'm, I feel a little safer. What is my fire resistance? Not
[502.66s -> 509.19s]  good. I don't think we should fight Diablo without proper fire resistance, but you know,
[510.15s -> 529.32s]  we'll see if we can get some. I'm going to take it very slow because I really don't want to play
[529.32s -> 534.20s]  Diablo for 12 minutes. I would, I would like to actually kill Diablo. All right. Let's go this
[534.20s -> 553.45s]  way. Right. Any majors, like for instance, up here, Diablo is a discount sun joke.
[558.10s -> 562.26s]  You could say that, but today is going to be fairly chill. It's not going to be that long.
[562.26s -> 569.80s]  It'll be probably about four, three, four, five hour long stream. I want to relax a little bit.
[569.80s -> 575.88s]  Last night was a little all over the place. I, uh, I got some good sleep though. I'm feeling
[575.88s -> 588.41s]  refreshed. You are so fucked laughing my ass off. I know. I know. I see the end of the tunnel
[589.37s -> 594.20s]  and I know what the outcome is. What's really going to end up happening
[595.24s -> 603.50s]  is this guy is going to have to kill Diablo. Not me. I'm going to have nothing to do with it.
[610.98s -> 617.56s]  That guy. Yeah, Vic. He's the one that killed Duriel. He's the one that killed Mephisto and
[617.56s -> 627.53s]  he'll be the one to kill Diablo. I'm just a bard that follows him around with my skeleton band.
[628.41s -> 638.38s]  We just sing while he fucking does work. All these skeletons all have different
[638.38s -> 645.66s]  fucking instruments. What a real pain in the ass that would be too. Imagine you had like a full
[646.78s -> 654.92s]  eight person band following you around. Three of them are singing. Two of them have little drums
[655.64s -> 661.24s]  be like, get the fuck away from me. They're all getting in the way.
[663.66s -> 668.73s]  That would suck because that's what we're doing to this guy.
[669.29s -> 676.10s]  How are we going? I really do want the way point though.
[679.24s -> 689.42s]  One of them's playing their rib cage like a xylophone. Uh, it's so stupid. I love it.
[690.30s -> 700.14s]  I love it. I really do wonder what you guys are going to do because revive is so good.
[701.02s -> 707.27s]  It's so good. But you know, there is, there is a channel community character.
[708.39s -> 721.96s]  I feel like that's going to win out over everything else. How's everybody doing? Everyone
[721.96s -> 728.92s]  good? Everyone feel safe? Everybody's dead. So that's a good sign. When I open the seals,
[728.92s -> 741.96s]  though, that's what it's going to be really painful. That was a lot of damage with one hit.
[743.00s -> 751.53s]  I think I really would, I think I'm going to get a pole going or maybe one of the mods can do it
[751.53s -> 758.46s]  well because I don't really want to die. Do you think I will beat Diablo? You think I will kill
[758.46s -> 769.80s]  Diablo? I got a wink. Did I? I'll do the pole. Let me see. Did I get a wink? No, I didn't. I didn't.
[769.80s -> 776.44s]  Nice try though. Uh, let me get a, let me get a pole. I'm actually curious as to what people
[776.44s -> 786.76s]  think about this because I have my answer, but I want to know your answer. I'm curious
[786.76s -> 830.54s]  what your answer is. Let's see. Vote on this. I'm going to check it later. Okay. Let's go.
[831.58s -> 844.97s]  Those are three very real scenarios. I do. I don't just die or I give up because I have to
[844.97s -> 855.62s]  run back and forth to the blood war. There's a no option for you both dying. Um, I'm not going to,
[856.81s -> 860.17s]  no, this, this isn't like a boxing game. We're not going to do a double knockout.
[862.92s -> 870.79s]  One of us is dead or I take 10% HP off of his bar every eight minutes and it gets to about
[870.79s -> 875.11s]  40% of the way there and it's been 40 minutes and I'm just done. And I'm like, no, nevermind
[881.54s -> 896.33s]  any of those are possible. I can get it. Once we get to the actual, that like sanctuary place,
[897.13s -> 902.17s]  not sanctuary, you know what I mean? What's the place before Diablo called? It has a specific
[902.17s -> 905.21s]  name. It's probably not the rip. What is it? It's like, it's like his castle.
[907.05s -> 916.33s]  Why do I not know this? You like, do you actually like this game, Jeremy? Do you enjoy playing this?
[916.33s -> 925.64s]  I feel like you really want to play goat simulator. There it is. Okay. Good. Here we go.
[927.96s -> 931.16s]  You know, I'm really just hiding the fact that I want to play goat simulator. Here it comes.
[943.11s -> 954.66s]  Why do these angels help? Proceed hero. You're the Nephilim. That's why you can do this.
[955.70s -> 964.39s]  Did I mention I can shoot lightning out of my hand? No, you do it. I gotta be careful.
[965.67s -> 973.18s]  I understand like the whole, no, no, no, I can't interfere. I can't interfere.
[975.29s -> 978.73s]  Terrial could just do a cleave and kill every enemy on this fucking map.
[979.45s -> 985.13s]  Like, could you at least just do that for me? Fine. Don't fight Diablo, but can you just drop
[985.13s -> 992.79s]  like a fucking angel nuke on this spot so we can just walk to him? And look, you can ghost ride it.
[992.79s -> 1001.62s]  I'll just say I did it in the history books. And it'll just be like, and then the brave
[1002.18s -> 1008.58s]  skeleton necromancer conjured up a gigantic ball of lightning and dropped it onto the river of
[1008.58s -> 1019.21s]  flame. Like, why can't you just say that? Does it matter? And I'll just, in all the interviews
[1019.21s -> 1022.89s]  that I do afterwards, I'll just be like, yeah, no, it was, I don't know. I just kind of did.
[1022.89s -> 1028.81s]  I used all my strength. I tried as hard as I could. And I, yeah, I don't, I can never do
[1028.81s -> 1048.70s]  it again though. I used all my energy. Yeah, the CCTV installed. Wait, would you like, like,
[1048.70s -> 1057.91s]  they're monitoring what's going on right now? Okay, but you wouldn't like the game.
[1063.30s -> 1066.90s]  Okay, but we're talking, we're talking strictly lore here. We're not talking about game, video
[1066.90s -> 1083.66s]  gameplay. Don't die. I got a full crew, right? Once those super uniques come out of the seals
[1083.66s -> 1090.76s]  is where I'm really going to have to shift my pants. I got to have portals ready. Can you
[1090.76s -> 1106.23s]  imagine a guy named Tommy Lee Bones in the history books? Use teeth. Teeth does three damage. What
[1106.23s -> 1124.09s]  I'm doing right now does 36 to 104. Teeth does three. All right, gollum's gonna die. Hey, come
[1124.09s -> 1137.21s]  on. A little bit higher. Oh, I have to kill Diablo with teeth. But you want to last hit Diablo with
[1137.21s -> 1146.90s]  teeth? That make you guys happy? Would you guys be happy satisfied if I did that? I'm not even
[1146.90s -> 1157.14s]  sure it's possible. All right, here it is. Oh, boy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1157.14s -> 1177.00s]  Just back it up. I need fire resistance. Bad. Still have these stamina potions for some reason.
[1179.77s -> 1187.53s]  Dude, that was an auto tube. What am I going to do with this shit? Does anything have fire
[1187.53s -> 1197.32s]  resistance? Oh, this does. I lose 41 health. That's a lot of health, but I gained 25%.
[1199.13s -> 1204.57s]  Me taking, let's say I take 100 points of damage from fire and like somebody does a 100 damage
[1204.57s -> 1219.32s]  spell is having 41 more health better than taking 75% of that. The health is better, right? Or is
[1219.32s -> 1228.07s]  the percentage better? I don't know. I need to do some math. I'm going to wear it. Any other
[1228.07s -> 1242.04s]  fire resist shields? You know, I need like a socket shield because with the socketed shield,
[1243.24s -> 1252.39s]  I could just dump rupees into it and get fire resist. There was ruining chat's character. What?
[1252.39s -> 1261.88s]  I'm just trying to, I'm trying to survive, man. His inventory is a mess. I should just sell this
[1261.88s -> 1278.41s]  thing. All right. I'm selling this. I'm at 33% fire resist. It's not very good. Resist is way
[1278.41s -> 1284.06s]  better than 40 health. I'm under 300 though. I'm going to get fucking double tapped and die
[1284.06s -> 1291.98s]  instantly. Okay. What do I have? I can't do anything. All right. Somebody's trash can
[1291.98s -> 1303.08s]  ruins have got to go here eventually. I think how many portals do I have? Let's go. It's still
[1303.08s -> 1309.91s]  alive, right? All right. Everybody get up here. There's the chaos sanctuary here. Oh fuck.
[1310.79s -> 1335.86s]  What do they have for resistance right now? Oh, oh, I'm going down. Vic, you got to stay alive,
[1335.86s -> 1350.42s]  man. We dropped Ruby puke cloud. Good. Nice work. I'm going to turn. I got to turn that into
[1350.42s -> 1361.06s]  a friend Gothic shield. Wait, I don't have anything. I need to find like a weapon there.
[1361.78s -> 1375.99s]  There let's go. Dodge the missiles. We're good. All right. Into the sanctuary. Let's go. I'm
[1375.99s -> 1381.69s]  actually nervous right now. I've never played a character on hardcore. I was just run in and
[1381.69s -> 1387.13s]  just don't give a shit is if I die, who cares, right? But even on normal, I'm kind of scared.
[1387.13s -> 1396.26s]  I really don't want to die, but this is a place where I can die because the boss here is scary
[1396.26s -> 1412.42s]  and he's hard because if you just, I don't know, we'll see. I'm scared. The one thing I am very
[1412.42s -> 1420.30s]  thankful of is besides the mages, the majors kind of suck. Everyone's staying alive in here,
[1420.30s -> 1433.30s]  which is encouraging. What do I do if I die? Oh, that's it. I close Diablo. What else can I do?
[1433.30s -> 1439.34s]  Make a new character. I'm like, I'm not doing it. I'm not going to do that. Be very, be sad for five
[1439.34s -> 1450.78s]  to 10 minutes and then move on to something else. All right. We've got to do the seals.
[1452.57s -> 1461.51s]  If you'd like to see where we're going to end up, Diablo spawns in here. Hey,
[1461.67s -> 1497.19s]  me. Army versus army. I got to get to level 30. We need an equalizer here. Oops. Oops.
[1503.61s -> 1512.95s]  All right. This is weakened. Careful. Vic, you good? All right. What does Vic have for fire
[1512.95s -> 1528.86s]  resistance? 58. Just keep Vic alive. Keep Vic alive. What you got to do is you got to get the
[1528.86s -> 1540.26s]  ball, the tuck. Arnold, I want you to pass over here to Helga. Helga, I want you to drive to the
[1540.26s -> 1560.02s]  hoop and then I want you to get the ball, the tuck. You guys don't like Hey Arnold? Nobody likes that
[1560.02s -> 1578.06s]  show. How old are you guys? Hey Arnold was like 20. If you guys are like 20, you didn't see Hey
[1578.06s -> 1597.45s]  Arnold? That was the thing in Hey Arnold. Oh shit, we got stuff. I loved Hey Arnold. My character
[1597.45s -> 1606.97s]  wasn't in the show for very long, but it was like a big episode. All right. I'll keep my references
[1606.97s -> 1626.39s]  to Garfield and SpongeBob. Garfield's older than Hey Arnold. He's just still relevant though. He's
[1626.39s -> 1648.41s]  been around for a long time. Thank you. Thank you. That's better. When was the last time you guys
[1648.41s -> 1652.97s]  actually read a Garfield comedy? I'm not talking about online. I'm talking about in a newspaper.
[1660.15s -> 1668.68s]  Never? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. For the amount of stuff you guys did. For the amount of talk.
[1668.68s -> 1672.68s]  For the amount that everyone talks about Garfield. I was assuming you guys were all big fans.
[1685.43s -> 1693.94s]  I get requests to play Garfield's card. Maybe like once every four days. All right. I have to be
[1693.94s -> 1709.40s]  careful up here. This beer sucks. This sucks too. I don't even want it. He said it. See you. Let's go.
[1710.20s -> 1734.86s]  This is Lord de Sace. I remember. Diablo does time seven damage to summons.
[1736.14s -> 1744.92s]  That's going to end very well for us. I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked. You have no idea guys.
[1744.92s -> 1752.86s]  I'm so fucked. I have to fight Diablo alone. I'm so, I'm going to die. It's going to be really,
[1752.86s -> 1771.08s]  really bad. I need to get more fire resist if I stand a chance. We'll probably get to
[1771.08s -> 1777.45s]  level 30 though. So that'd be good. Don't get in the middle of a firestorm.
[1792.46s -> 1799.75s]  Come on. Level up. I need it. This is a huge amount of money just came in. Hold on. Actually
[1799.75s -> 1804.70s]  huge, huge money. Oh, I was supposed to, let me see the, will he, let me check this first.
[1804.70s -> 1810.36s]  Will he kill Diablo? Most of you think yes. Besides the people that think I'm going to
[1810.36s -> 1815.74s]  run around in circles for 30 minutes and they give up. I appreciate the enthusiasm though. Thank you.
[1815.74s -> 1823.46s]  Thanks guys. I just mentioned it and now more votes are coming in. All right. All right. Not
[1823.46s -> 1829.06s]  very many people don't think I'm going to do it. That's, that really is encouraging. Okay. Let's
[1829.06s -> 1846.17s]  get my, let's get my bits up here. Somebody gave a hundred bucks. Rentaburger gave 10,000 bits
[1846.17s -> 1854.65s]  thanks to the hundred fucking dollars Rentaburger. I can't believe I get to become a sub baby in a
[1854.65s -> 1859.61s]  Diablo 2 stream. Come a long way from the first of your videos I ever saw. I watched Germania in
[1859.61s -> 1874.18s]  2014 for almost an entire minute before I realized it was funny on purpose. I'm confused. What does
[1874.18s -> 1879.66s]  that mean? I watched Germania for almost an entire minute before I really, oh, you thought it was,
[1879.66s -> 1890.02s]  you thought it was somebody making like a real league or something? Funny by accident. That's so
[1890.02s -> 1903.46s]  funny. Yeah, we got a wink too. Got my backpack. I'm ready for school. Hey, is that a different
[1903.46s -> 1917.03s]  Germa? He looks different today. I'm not wearing overalls. It's imposter Jeremy. No, it's because
[1917.03s -> 1920.23s]  my pupils are small because the sun's in my eyes. That's what people don't, that's what it is.
[1921.19s -> 1930.97s]  I'm not wearing a backpack. No, I've got, I'm wearing my boomer brace for my costochondritis.
[1933.00s -> 1944.71s]  You have small pupils. I do look like I'm going to school though. Just waiting for the bus mom.
[1945.59s -> 1948.71s]  No, it's, I got a costochondritis. I got a fucking back brace on
[1949.59s -> 1962.95s]  as you wink. Uh, but rent a burger. Thank you so much for the fucking ridiculous amount of money.
[1963.99s -> 1968.71s]  A hundred dollars. I never expect anyone to give one dollar, let alone a hundred of them.
[1969.91s -> 1986.10s]  Seriously. Thanks. Am I wearing beads on my wrist? Shit, shit that you saw it. God damn it. No,
[1986.90s -> 2000.39s]  I forgot this was on. It's, it's a, it's, it's black tourmaline. It's like a crystal bracelet.
[2000.39s -> 2005.99s]  I, I, I'm just wearing it because I, it's a crystal bracelet. It's black tourmaline
[2007.38s -> 2011.94s]  and it's supposed to help with your energy. It's not, it's made up. Like it's literally all made up.
[2013.70s -> 2018.58s]  I just thought it was cute that I put it on. It's literally the whole, the whole thing's made up.
[2019.06s -> 2026.79s]  Uh, somebody made it up and sold bracelets to people. I just thought it was cool. It's like
[2026.79s -> 2032.55s]  cool. That's an interesting idea. Like, oh, it's like crystals and it's like power crystals.
[2032.55s -> 2039.03s]  It's, I know it's like, could be just bullshit. Whatever. It's fun. It was like 12 bucks. Add a
[2039.03s -> 2047.90s]  couple zeros. It's cool. There's like different crystals. This is like, look, okay, hold on. Let
[2047.90s -> 2056.25s]  me, why is my game crashing? I am not going to lose in act. I'm going to, I'll save and exit.
[2061.03s -> 2069.19s]  Okay. Um, look, see, isn't this cool? It's like a gem. It's like a stone. It's a crystal. It's
[2069.19s -> 2079.50s]  like kind of interesting. I don't, I don't like think it's going to like heal my ailments because
[2079.50s -> 2083.18s]  I think it would look cool. And it's like interesting concept and it's like cool like history.
[2083.18s -> 2088.33s]  And I always take this off before streams. I know someone's going to be like, what the fuck is he
[2088.33s -> 2092.89s]  wearing? And then I have to do a baby food explanation and I wanted to avoid the baby food
[2092.89s -> 2102.95s]  explanation, but I had, all right. Everybody's dead. Everybody's dead. Everybody's dead. I have
[2102.95s -> 2124.79s]  to hold on. I leveled up. Why is everybody getting smoked? Somebody said it's just a bracelet, dude.
[2124.79s -> 2132.62s]  It's all right. I know, but it's a, it's like a black tourmaline crystal stone bracelet.
[2140.07s -> 2152.65s]  Holy fuck. This guy is eating me alive. I think it's neat. Yeah. I think it's cool. It's all right.
[2156.79s -> 2164.47s]  We good. Who is it? Just Lord they say. All right. Get in there and holy fuck. I'm in trouble.
[2165.11s -> 2171.82s]  I'm just going to keep putting people in there. Dude, they're dying before they can even come out
[2171.82s -> 2187.58s]  of, they die before they can even like get out of the womb or whatever this is. Get in there.
[2187.58s -> 2204.84s]  Goodbye. We're going to fall back and we have a point to put in. That's priority. Number one
[2204.84s -> 2211.46s]  right now. We've got a point. Uh, click maps are going to be enabled here. If you'd like to vote
[2211.46s -> 2215.78s]  for something, you just have to click the screen. You will see it on the screen in just a moment.
[2219.26s -> 2229.35s]  Okay. So here's what the points are so far. We have unlocked the bottom row on the summoning side.
[2229.35s -> 2234.95s]  And again, this is fire Golem and this is revive. Revive can bring anything back to life for a
[2235.59s -> 2241.99s]  significant portion of time. Fire Golem is fireman. We also have the other points here.
[2241.99s -> 2251.22s]  Summon resist Golem mastery. You don't have to be embarrassed about owning crystals for their
[2251.22s -> 2259.38s]  properties. I know where it gives me power. How do you guys think I can like fucking, how do you
[2259.38s -> 2263.14s]  think, where do you think my comedy comes from? It comes from this fucking bracelet. I don't wear
[2263.14s -> 2273.70s]  this. I've can't, I'm not funny. This is where it comes from. It's a comedy bracelet. When I take this
[2273.70s -> 2280.42s]  off, I like, I like decrepify. I've got somewhere I got like boomer brace on like power crystals.
[2282.07s -> 2293.35s]  All right. Where do you guys want to go? What are you thinking? We may have to zoom in for this one.
[2293.35s -> 2318.02s]  We might have to zoom in. We'll see if it splits. Do I have a Zen garden? No, it would die.
[2319.14s -> 2322.73s]  I wouldn't, I would, I can't be, I wouldn't be, I would, it would die. I wouldn't be able to take
[2322.73s -> 2330.71s]  care of it. I would be like, dude, Zen garden. Oh, I can't wait. And I would, the first day I would
[2330.71s -> 2335.67s]  strip, strip, strip, trim, trim, trim, place the rocks, put the trees. Ooh, this is so cool. And
[2335.67s -> 2339.35s]  I'd put it out in the sun. Wow. And I'd forget it was there. And then three weeks later, everything
[2339.35s -> 2354.02s]  would be dead and I would find it. I'm going to zoom in. Oh, wait, that, wait, that, that's,
[2354.02s -> 2358.42s]  that's one of those trees. That's one of those little trees. Wrong. Zen garden is not, what's
[2358.42s -> 2364.66s]  it called? Uh, the, the little tree, the bonsai tree. Yeah. Whoops. Zen garden is just sand with
[2364.66s -> 2375.67s]  rocks. I'd fucking spill it. Not a bonsai tree, not a bonsai. No, it's a bonsai tree, bonsai,
[2375.67s -> 2386.54s]  bonsi tree, bonsai tree, bonsi buddy tree. All right. Let me zoom this shit in because you guys,
[2386.54s -> 2400.92s]  you guys are, you're split at the bottom. You're not supposed to see that.
[2402.04s -> 2404.60s]  Did you guys know that when a graphic is on screen, it's like magic?
[2405.64s -> 2418.34s]  All right. Choose wisely. Decrepify for fuck's sake. Gray, I can't, I cannot influence anything.
[2418.34s -> 2442.84s]  They've chosen to be down here. I, uh, I can't click poison over guys. That's, we don't have
[2442.84s -> 2456.26s]  enough points. All right. Spreading ourselves out. We're going to make our own Diablo.
[2459.51s -> 2468.01s]  We have, he's exactly like you in every way, except he's one eighth your size.
[2468.25s -> 2492.41s]  Here we go. Fire golem, mini Diablo. There he is. How strong is he? 400 health, 165 attack, 40,
[2492.41s -> 2500.79s]  410 defense, absorbs 36% of fire damage, fire damage, 44 to 90. Holy fire. 46. It's actually
[2500.79s -> 2511.90s]  going to come down to can my mini me Diablo beat actual Diablo? You think that's a joke? It's not.
[2511.90s -> 2519.13s]  Where are the stats going? Oh, wait, before I do that, just so you can get a clear indicator,
[2519.13s -> 2526.71s]  here's what the stats look like right now. Revive Vic? Oh, I absolutely will. I, when we open this
[2526.71s -> 2536.22s]  last seal, I am not going to get any more skeletons because they're all going to instantly explode.
[2536.86s -> 2543.90s]  The presence of Diablo is going to kill every single skeleton. So it's Vic and fireman versus
[2543.90s -> 2548.30s]  Diablo. We're not going to get them anymore. All right. You see what the stats are. We have 5%
[2548.54s -> 2555.26s]  We're not going to get them anymore. All right. You see what the stats are. We have 5 points.
[2555.26s -> 2572.57s]  All 5 points are going into what you pick. Choose wisely. Choose wisely. And a wink showed up. Yeah,
[2572.57s -> 2588.23s]  it did. All in on vitality. Yeah, this is not, this is not even a contest.
[2589.27s -> 2609.45s]  You're all right. You look like you're in pain. I do? I look, oh, I think I look okay. Do I look
[2609.45s -> 2624.10s]  like I'm in pain? Great hair today. It was styled by a professional. A shower head and then a comb.
[2625.22s -> 2638.63s]  Vitality. Thanks for voting. Lego hair of the year. New category 2020 awards.
[2639.19s -> 2653.96s]  Best Lego hair of the year. Back over 300. All right. Here we go. Let's get a Vic back.
[2654.92s -> 2662.68s]  $6,300. I am going to get a full group though for this. So I'm just going to, I'm only doing
[2662.68s -> 2669.43s]  this so I can revive some people and then we're going back through the portal. Yeah, I know,
[2669.43s -> 2685.51s]  I know. I'm just getting a full skeleton crew. Your skin is really clear. Just drink more water.
[2687.11s -> 2690.95s]  Make sure you get adequate rest. You want to be, you want to get some good sleep.
[2690.95s -> 2700.76s]  Make sure you're sleeping well and also make a blood contract with the devil.
[2725.82s -> 2728.70s]  Whatever. It's not, it's not that far. I know where it is. Everything's dead.
[2735.75s -> 2740.07s]  Everything's dead. Whatever. Just drink one of these and run. I got a full group.
[2748.30s -> 2760.02s]  Mormu. 13 community subs from Mormu. Thank you, Mormu. Congratulations to those that all got them.
[2760.66s -> 2767.82s]  No, no, no, no, no. Don't even fight. Don't even fight. Just go. How do I do, how do we,
[2767.82s -> 2775.70s]  how do you do a blood contract with the devil? Look up into the, down to the ground and go,
[2775.70s -> 2789.50s]  oh, devil of mine, I'd like to open a contract and then a pop-up window will show up
[2792.82s -> 2803.53s]  and you are, you have to go into a queue. Usually about 16 to 17 years long and then you have your
[2803.53s -> 2819.59s]  appointment. Okay, what a portal here. Guys, you, you, you gotta remember you, you're going,
[2819.59s -> 2823.35s]  you, you're, you're behind people that like sold their soul to the devil for like a pack of gum.
[2825.78s -> 2829.54s]  You know, people say this shit all the time. Like, oh, I'd sell my soul for a fucking hamburger
[2829.54s -> 2834.01s]  right now that you, you now 17 years later, you need to pop up. You will sell this soul for all
[2834.01s -> 2841.16s]  kinds of fucking crazy shit. How do you think the guy from fucking that pot, how do you think the
[2841.16s -> 2848.31s]  guy from Popeye died? Burger guy. He sold his soul to the devil for a fucking hamburger. What was
[2848.31s -> 2869.80s]  his name? Tootie? What was that guy's name? Wimpy. Wimpy. His name was shitty. By the way, I,
[2870.44s -> 2876.18s]  I feel like I stole that joke. Anybody else get, feel that? Like, I feel like they've made,
[2876.18s -> 2882.36s]  somebody's made that joke somewhere. You know what I mean? Like, oh, he's like wimpy, sold his soul
[2882.36s -> 2887.82s]  to the devil for a hamburger. That's like an easy joke to do. That's probably something. I'm sure it
[2887.82s -> 2907.75s]  happened. All right. Uh, once I opened these seals, this is it. Clown anxiety. Oh God. Okay.
[2907.75s -> 2916.39s]  Let's, I gotta get a portal all the way back here. He's going to say the line. Here we go.
[2917.77s -> 2925.72s]  Let's open this one first because we're going to get ported on. Okay. You ready?
[2926.36s -> 2939.93s]  Here we go. Oh, it's this motherfucker. I forgot. Get in there fireman.
[2955.00s -> 2966.12s]  No way. Vic. All right. This is my Vic fund. At least I have money in the Vic fund.
[2966.76s -> 2983.72s]  Please keep bringing him back. Oh boy. We're going to, we're going to walk there again
[2984.28s -> 2991.40s]  from here because I need another, I need another army. I knew this was going to happen.
[3000.04s -> 3006.62s]  I can't go back in that portal as the portal will be surrounded. What's my opinion on
[3006.62s -> 3022.33s]  Warcraft reforged? Um, it would have been nice if it was actually reforged. Warcraft refunded.
[3023.13s -> 3032.90s]  For some reason, I don't know why Blizzard thinks this, but when you open up the oven
[3032.90s -> 3047.53s]  to check on your pizza, it's not the same as making a video game. What the fuck does that mean?
[3057.45s -> 3072.14s]  You know, I was going somewhere. If you reheat. No, I fucked it up. Uh, sorry. Fuck is this not
[3072.14s -> 3077.51s]  doing on? Uh, I meant to say is, uh, reheating your leftovers is not the same thing as making
[3077.51s -> 3089.58s]  a new pizza. And why did I take it off? All right. Wait, no, no, don't go over there yet.
[3099.06s -> 3105.46s]  $1,200 bracelet joke. It's not that much money. It was like, it was probably like $9.
[3105.46s -> 3122.39s]  $9. Okay, let's go get in there and start fighting. Go overwhelm them one at a time.
[3123.19s -> 3135.42s]  They can't, they can't kill us all. Okay. Hold on. Get in overwhelmed. Forget, forget about the big
[3135.42s -> 3141.11s]  blue guy. He will instantly kill me if he touches me though. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. We're going. We're
[3141.11s -> 3167.08s]  going. We're going. Get ready. Where's the portal? All right, guys, we've been a, we've been a good
[3167.72s -> 3175.21s]  crew for a long time. I'm going to need you to step up. Go for it.
[3181.66s -> 3205.27s]  Get him. He killed everybody. Wait, wait, run away. He, okay. He's got like the 3% of his health is
[3205.27s -> 3216.25s]  gone. All right. Where's, where's my fire? Wait, iron golem is 397. Fire golem. You and me. I'll
[3216.25s -> 3241.18s]  just recast you over and over again. Fight him. Get in there and fight him. Get him. How, why is
[3241.18s -> 3267.59s]  he, why is he freezing him? I don't have enough mana for this shit. All right. You want another
[3267.59s -> 3276.94s]  strategy? It's got to be Vic. It's got to be Vic with rejuvenation potions. I just have to spam
[3276.94s -> 3298.60s]  rejuvenation potions on him. Super, super, super, greater, greater, greater. God, I need a gem.
[3299.50s -> 3314.14s]  I need chip gems. Oh, let me just try here. You take this helmet. You take this. He's got 75%
[3314.14s -> 3331.93s]  fire resist. Okay. I'm going to just, let's see how long he lives. This is a test. All right, Vic.
[3334.20s -> 3341.67s]  He needs lightning. He's got 58% lightning. All right, come on, Vic. Let's go. I'm just going to
[3341.67s -> 3348.54s]  try to keep you alive. Give Vic the controller. Vic, turn on your blessing, please. You're really
[3348.54s -> 3351.74s]  going to be the guy in the raid that doesn't have his blessings on and shit. Come on. Do I have to
[3351.74s -> 3356.30s]  remind everybody? Why do I have, as the raid leader have to constantly tell people how to use their
[3356.30s -> 3395.14s]  own moves? I have an idea. Iron Golem. Iron Golem returns 225% damage back to the attacker.
[3395.14s -> 3401.61s]  We're just going to have Diablo kill this guy and hurt himself over and over again.
[3401.61s -> 3424.82s]  Let's test the theory. Is it working? Holy shit, it kind of worked. Holy shit, it kind of worked.
[3426.26s -> 3434.38s]  Leave, run. Oh, that was a ton of damage. Get me out. Get me out. Should I port? He's going to
[3434.38s -> 3441.38s]  chase me down here. Port here. This is fine. Do you see the damage? That took like, all right.
[3441.38s -> 3448.54s]  That's the plan. I'm just going to buy like 10 swords. What's the cheapest sword I can possibly
[3448.54s -> 3466.68s]  buy? All right. Just buy all the cheap shit. Get your helmet back. All right. I'm going to get the
[3466.68s -> 3474.31s]  helmet back. I need a socket. Give me this. Okay. I got the helmet back and I'm going to get a
[3474.31s -> 3488.66s]  socket shield and just put rubies in it. You sell those? Fire defense on any of these? I don't care.
[3488.66s -> 3500.95s]  I will wear like my big brother's clothes. Look at this. 30%. I don't care about that. Just put it
[3500.95s -> 3519.78s]  on and give this back. Act one. Good call. But Diablo is going to start. It doesn't matter if
[3519.78s -> 3524.90s]  he regens. We're just going to sacrifice like 30 iron golems. We're just going to, okay. We're
[3524.90s -> 3531.70s]  just going to, we're going to riddle trash all over the arena so I can always revive an iron
[3531.70s -> 3540.58s]  golem no matter where I am. I'm going to just back up a dump truck and dump the whole thing
[3540.58s -> 3555.94s]  into the arena. This is so stupid. What a joke. This is 60. I don't have enough money.
[3555.94s -> 3579.08s]  Oh no, rub. Just sell this. Use daggers? Well, I, I bought them all.
[3589.24s -> 3620.98s]  I already have. Okay. Let's go. Move the potions. So we need a distraction for a minute.
[3621.78s -> 3628.62s]  That should be enough for a little while. You're triggering me with your inventory management.
[3629.26s -> 3647.26s]  You know what a seller spider is? If you don't know, look it up. That's how I roll. Holy fuck,
[3647.26s -> 3664.30s]  doesn't leave. So we need to do one of these right now. Here's one. All right. I need to do this.
[3665.51s -> 3672.82s]  Let's start riddling this area. Like I'm going to say this is the trash zone right here.
[3672.82s -> 3714.14s]  Let's go. He heard himself. Get in there. It's kind of working. I just have to stay alive.
[3714.86s -> 3750.26s]  Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh, he's almost at the O. Oh, that's it. I have nothing left.
[3750.26s -> 3804.63s]  What's he at? He's past the O. Get me out of here. It's too big. Too big. Whatever. Impossible. Any
[3804.63s -> 3870.04s]  more little ones. That's good. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Your potions suck. Fuck.
[3870.04s -> 3911.43s]  Oh my God. I need mana. What's going on? Oh my God. This is where it ends. He put me in a cage.
[3911.75s -> 3955.35s]  Oh no. Just get up here. Get him. Oh fuck. He's down to the L. Get in there. Get in there. Go get him.
[3975.02s -> 4031.72s]  Why? It's starting to get expensive. God damn it, man. These shitty hand axes. Move these potions
[4031.72s -> 4092.44s]  out of the way. That's not even metal. Wait, no. Come here. Bait it, bait it, bait it, bait it.
[4095.03s -> 4132.65s]  He's almost at half health. This is going to work. He can't hit him. Oh, don't run down here. He's
[4132.65s -> 4154.02s]  dead. Oh fuck. Wrap around. Where's my pile? Where's my trash? Hit him. Come on. Get in there.
[4154.02s -> 4159.42s]  Come on. Get in there. Watch out. I shouldn't be going down that hall anymore. We're going to move
[4159.42s -> 4178.22s]  our trash. We're going to move our trash over here. This is really the only safe place for it. It's
[4178.22s -> 4201.46s]  like up here. Ready? Just don't kill me. Get out of the way, please. He trapped him in a cage.
[4203.05s -> 4230.47s]  Actually working up for us. He's coming for me. Why? God damn it. Look at his health. All right. I
[4230.47s -> 4235.94s]  got to back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Look at this. He's almost... This motherfucker is dead.
[4236.95s -> 4243.98s]  This motherfucker is dead. Ain't no way he wins. Look at his health. Back to act three, act two.
[4244.62s -> 4300.04s]  Do you trade? You do. What do you got? Do you have any junk? You do. Let's go. Potions. Trash pile.
[4300.04s -> 4309.62s]  Going up here. Oh my God. He's right there. Wait. Don't do anything stupid. Right here. Trash pile.
[4309.62s -> 4344.63s]  Right here. This is a bad spot. He's already dead. Fuck. I got to get him away. That's a bad spot.
[4344.63s -> 4370.20s]  Oh my God. Not a good run. Not a good one so far. We got to wrap around the other way. No.
[4371.48s -> 4377.64s]  He's... We got this tiny fucking hallway. We have to pull him. Don't go in yet. Pull him down here.
[4377.64s -> 4390.81s]  Pull him down here, please. He done... All right. New strategy. Come with me. We're putting a portal
[4390.81s -> 4407.34s]  up here. We're going this way. We're doing another trash zone up here. Right here. Up the trash. Good.
[4407.34s -> 4415.19s]  Okay. Let's go. He'll chase us over here and we have an open space now.
[4415.19s -> 4425.91s]  Follow me. Chase me. Look. He's a piece behind the D right now. Get over here. Find me. Follow me.
[4426.55s -> 4434.92s]  Good. I'll bait it.
[4443.61s -> 4451.30s]  Come on. Come on. We can do it. It's so close. My stamina. Watch that stamina.
[4451.86s -> 4478.44s]  That was almost a killer. We instantly probably killed him. It's okay. Oh my God. Where's he running?
[4479.08s -> 4496.92s]  We're out of trash. He's blocked the entrance. Okay. We have to do another trash run. I'm going
[4496.92s -> 4511.53s]  right in that portal after I cast this. Okay. Go. There's more trash here? Where? I don't see.
[4511.53s -> 4531.66s]  Oh, I wish that counted. Who sells stuff here? No, no, no. I don't know who sells stuff here.
[4531.66s -> 4539.98s]  I forget. New act. Act two. Again. Down here. Just... I don't care. Whatever. I have plenty of money.
[4539.98s -> 4613.90s]  Okay. No, don't go in. Are you stupid? Come on. Look at how close I am. All right. Trash pile set.
[4613.90s -> 4621.42s]  Good run. That was a really good run. Excellent work. Excellent work. Trash. Trash heap number 60.
[4621.42s -> 4648.17s]  Good job. 61. Not so good. I think he's found. He found the trash. He's spotted. He's spotted. Hold
[4648.17s -> 4675.54s]  on. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is a bad idea. This is a really bad.
[4675.54s -> 4685.16s]  That's three damage, guys. Nope. Don't care. I'm living. My heart just exploded. I thought I was
[4685.16s -> 4711.21s]  dead. He still has too much health. Oh my God. No, no, no. Who cares about jokes? Give me up.
[4711.93s -> 4721.85s]  Help me. Trash monster number... That was the loudest I think I've... That was the most actual
[4721.85s -> 4728.52s]  real scream I've done in a long time. That was like I was about to get into a car accident.
[4733.18s -> 4756.55s]  I got him. No uniques. Game sucks. I said... Somebody said that was the stupidest fucking way I've
[4756.55s -> 4777.59s]  ever seen somebody kill Diablo. I worked for it. He's dead. Wow. My title can change now.
[4779.54s -> 4790.49s]  Oh. Hey, look guys. You see how it saved the run? You guys put six points into iron golem for some
[4790.49s -> 4812.81s]  reason. And here he is. He was returning. 225% damage done, returned. That's pretty good.
[4812.81s -> 4826.31s]  That's pretty good. Dude, trash pile 69 for the rumble. All right. Well, we did it. We can move
[4826.31s -> 4833.32s]  on to act five and we get to watch my favorite cut scene. Did anything else? Let me... I know
[4833.32s -> 4853.05s]  canes here, but we did it. First cane. This is a great day indeed. Oh no. Holy shit. I'm gonna
[4853.05s -> 4864.47s]  just get 50 subs. 50 community subs from Zyxia. Jesus.
[4864.47s -> 4876.87s]  Yes. Thanks so much. Seriously. That's a lot of fucking money. That's so much money.
[4879.19s -> 4880.71s]  I am honored that you would give it to me.
[4886.25s -> 4891.85s]  Best act, by the way, incoming. Act five D2 is awesome.
[4891.85s -> 4907.13s]  This place now. Thank you hero. Praise be to the light. Diablo and Mephisto have been
[4907.13s -> 4918.42s]  and big bits into the black abyss that spawned them and the corrupted soul stones are no more
[4918.42s -> 4925.59s]  bailing an army of hellish minions. Now this army is searching for the world stone ancient
[4925.59s -> 4931.37s]  source of all the soul stones and their power while leaving behind a wake destruction.
[4931.37s -> 4936.66s]  Yes. We're going to the barbarian homeland. Ben Eleanor gave the bits, by the way. I just wanted
[4936.66s -> 4946.26s]  to wait till that was done talking. Ben Eleanor gave 5,000 bits. Thanks Ben. Seriously. It's
[4946.26s -> 4954.74s]  never, never necessary to ever give this channel these amounts of huge dollar signs. Thanks.
[4955.46s -> 4959.06s]  I hope you can afford it and I'm glad that you think it's worth paying for.
[4959.78s -> 4962.90s]  Thank you. They say, hey, I hope you're doing well. It's been a while since I caught one of
[4962.90s -> 4972.06s]  your streams. Thanks for being amazing. Thanks. I appreciate it. Scam Wink. It's already been paid
[4972.06s -> 4986.62s]  for like five times. Backpack. Talking about my backpack. Let's identify these because it might
[4986.62s -> 5013.67s]  be anything. It might be good. No. Yes. Not an assassin. Well, we did it. Oops. All it took was
[5014.63s -> 5024.86s]  just buying up everybody's trash. Let's repair and let's watch. Let's watch one of my favorite
[5024.86s -> 5164.31s]  cutscenes. Here we go. The gates of Cessaron have stood for eons beyond remembrance
[5165.35s -> 5173.83s]  and you shall not reach them now. Remove your foul demons from our lands. We stand on the side of
[5173.83s -> 5183.42s]  light and you shall not be allowed to reach Mount Ariat and that which you seek will not be yours.
[5183.66s -> 5207.24s]  Enough! Enough! Enough! I shall take your position into consideration.
[5247.91s -> 5253.83s]  Well, it seems your terms are not acceptable.
[5278.31s -> 5294.68s]  Bail. Best act. Best act. Best boss. Best villain. My voice is low because that was it. The audio
[5294.68s -> 5312.89s]  is incredibly loud. Best laugh. Best enough. We're in act five. Hooray. Currently under siege.
[5313.45s -> 5329.48s]  Best salad. Worst build. I have to say that was like a nine out of ten. Enough. It was.
[5338.71s -> 5344.84s]  I've been helpless to stop them. Bail is still out on the mountain looking for something.
[5344.84s -> 5365.74s]  Bail is looking for something. The world's stolen. Look, it's Otto. Best music. So first things first.
[5367.02s -> 5377.16s]  Let's, we're gonna say goodbye to our iron golem who's very, very good, but it's time to replace
[5379.59s -> 5388.17s]  with our fire golem. Fire golem just does more damage. Rest easy. Trash number 69.
[5390.58s -> 5405.11s]  He's ready to be swept up into the great dumpster out behind the chilies. Goodbye. Farewell.
[5418.90s -> 5424.10s]  Shank the Overseer. This is coming up here. Wait, is this Diablo or Warcraft? What's the
[5424.10s -> 5432.66s]  difference? What is this? So let me help you out here.
[5432.90s -> 5442.10s]  Diablo one and two way better than Warcraft. Here it is. Diablo one and two better for me than
[5442.10s -> 5451.43s]  Warcraft three. Warcraft one and two way worse to me than Diablo one and two. Diablo three way worse
[5451.43s -> 5461.13s]  than Warcraft one and two. They kind of switch. They swap. It's wrong. I mean, I have to disagree.
[5461.13s -> 5466.98s]  Diablo two is better than Warcraft three. I'm just gonna say it head to head, pound for pound. I think
[5466.98s -> 5479.78s]  Diablo two is a better game. Although I'm biased because this is like, I love this game. I love
[5479.78s -> 5488.66s]  this franchise. So I'm pretty biased. Why is there just a shield in here? All right. Stop the siege
[5488.66s -> 5493.00s]  by killing Shank the Overseer in the bloody foothills. We're going to have an army. This
[5493.00s -> 5506.26s]  should be pretty easy. I use that term pretty loosely. I do want to get Vic back. Oh, well,
[5506.58s -> 5509.14s]  I remember this guy. This guy. Spoiler alert. This guy.
[5531.22s -> 5552.55s]  We're both necromancers, man. Come on. A lot of lore here. I really do implore you to buy this.
[5552.55s -> 5568.49s]  No, I don't. It takes more than a siege to stop me. All right, get him.
[5570.25s -> 5574.49s]  I need Vic. I need Vic. The reason why I say is because the game doesn't really run that well.
[5574.49s -> 5578.65s]  You got to do a bunch of bullshit to get it to run. Blizzard does this really great thing where
[5578.65s -> 5583.37s]  they sell a game for $20 on their official website. And like the game can barely run on
[5583.37s -> 5590.36s]  like Windows 7 computers. It's cool. It's really cool. Like you have to download fucking third
[5590.36s -> 5596.15s]  party apps to get it to run the way it was supposed to run. $20, by the way,
[5597.69s -> 5614.26s]  on the official Blizzard shop. You need, uh, where is it? There it gets Qualkeck. There is
[5614.90s -> 5624.98s]  Qualkeck. There you are. I am Qualkeck. We, all right, this is where we have to, no, no, no,
[5624.98s -> 5635.75s]  this is very important. Do we trade Vic's combat aura for a super strong, heavy melee damage
[5635.75s -> 5655.64s]  barbarian? Yeah, Vic just makes all the skeletons stronger. Barbarians are cool though.
[5655.64s -> 5664.46s]  Just fun to watch him use two hands and swing and shit. I love it. All right, let's get the army back.
[5674.10s -> 5683.19s]  They're not going to instantaneously die now. Also, I'm thinking of, uh,
[5684.47s -> 5696.04s]  thinking of doing a couple of Mephisto runs. Thinking about it. We need better gear.
[5696.68s -> 5701.26s]  I need it. All right, after shank the overseer, we're going to do, uh, at least one,
[5702.30s -> 5709.34s]  at least one Mephisto run. We're going to go, we're going to go open up the treasure box that
[5709.34s -> 5729.34s]  is Mephisto's body. I need all the help I can get. This is true. I got rid of my keys, right?
[5731.24s -> 5755.88s]  And we'll get in there, guys. Come on. I don't, don't go up too far. I get overwhelmed if I go
[5755.88s -> 5763.96s]  too far. I want a better spear for him. Everybody needs better stuff. He's got a unique, but it's an
[5763.96s -> 5772.79s]  old, unique level 17, 11 to 27 life steal. I mean, it's, it's just old. We're like level,
[5772.79s -> 5777.91s]  how old is, how, not how old, what level is he? 29. We've got to get her something better than that.
[5786.89s -> 5801.26s]  Life still is really good for tanking. Yeah, it is. It is very good. What do you, what do you
[5801.26s -> 5805.26s]  get for doing this? I forget. I think you actually get a rune word. Yeah. It gives like
[5805.26s -> 5818.74s]  Rao or Tao. You get Kim the gifted prize. We have not gone to McDonald's. I've not given 10
[5818.74s -> 5823.46s]  community fries to, uh, Kim yet. We have to go to McDonald's. The next time we go, I will.
[5837.26s -> 5845.24s]  He hates Kim. Everything they have, everything has to be hated.
[5845.96s -> 5862.12s]  We're good. Terrible. Skeleton friends are starting to die faster now. I don't like it.
[5862.84s -> 5872.07s]  We need better stuff. I'm definitely going on at least one. We need at least one more unique,
[5872.07s -> 5902.54s]  one more set. Pretty good. What free full set do you get when you hit max level?
[5902.54s -> 5921.50s]  Well, that's very interesting. You don't. I'm affording Goblin.
[5931.10s -> 5937.50s]  Ooh, a wand. You know what? That's the problem with Diablo 3 now and Diablo 3 in general
[5938.70s -> 5949.62s]  is it was never about the journey. It was about the grind. It was just get max level
[5949.62s -> 5956.50s]  fast as possible. Get set to do max level riffs and just grind riffs until you have
[5957.30s -> 5966.81s]  your gem is max the fuck out. It was just, and you could, I guess you could argue that during
[5966.81s -> 5974.12s]  this game's heyday at the cow level was the same thing. But even when I first played through Diablo
[5974.12s -> 5985.16s]  3 and Reaper, it just felt, it just felt like a get to the grind, not necessarily like kill Diablo,
[5986.12s -> 5992.44s]  especially considering what they did with the Nephilim riffs. Like it was just log on and just
[5992.44s -> 6005.64s]  watch white and yellow numbers explode on your screen. And that's it. Here comes a three hour
[6005.64s -> 6014.55s]  video essay. Oh no, it's, hey, there's Decrepify. It's a lot of cold resist. I should hold on to
[6014.55s -> 6031.85s]  this. Ooh, magic find. You're going to have a video essay with a YouTube video essay that's three
[6031.85s -> 6052.68s]  hours that has 14,000 views. Why is that so specific? That's so specific. That's all video
[6052.76s -> 6081.27s]  essays. Don't want to die. Grand charm. Come on. Have it be a good one. Shit dog shit.
[6082.41s -> 6099.62s]  Just dog shit. Oh my God. How bad one to maximum damage. That's this is little brother levels of
[6099.62s -> 6105.70s]  bad. Your little brother would have this on and he'd be like level 60 and he'd still have it on.
[6106.34s -> 6123.45s]  That's what I forgot. I had jewelry slots. I picked that up already identified
[6125.30s -> 6128.74s]  or it went immediately into the slot. I didn't even put it there.
[6129.78s -> 6141.64s]  This way, this way, this way. I think I'm almost at the top. Get in there. All right, slow down.
[6142.52s -> 6153.43s]  All right, I'm going to get in the middle. We leveled up, level 30.
[6157.66s -> 6174.86s]  It's not in my inventory. Why? Where is it? Where'd it go? I think it also
[6175.82s -> 6181.45s]  video essay incoming. The reason why I had so much fun with this game was
[6182.41s -> 6188.97s]  just miserably failing characters like trying to do a vengeance paladin.
[6190.65s -> 6199.90s]  It was just you could mess up. You could screw the fuck up in Diablo 2 and maybe you could still
[6199.90s -> 6208.41s]  try to make it work. D3. It's just you made a barbarian and then I don't like this switch
[6208.49s -> 6214.47s]  switch switch. I can just use this one who cares. There were no stakes to your character.
[6216.07s -> 6227.82s]  It was just here's everything. Use whatever you want. All right, here we go.
[6229.18s -> 6232.39s]  Video essay 2. All right, hold on. Shanks up here.
[6235.27s -> 6238.39s]  Every time I played this game when I was younger, I always had to say that out loud.
[6238.39s -> 6241.59s]  Every time I got here, no matter how many times I've been here, I would go,
[6241.67s -> 6248.60s]  shank the ol' bustier every time I just did it again. God, I remember when I was younger.
[6250.60s -> 6265.91s]  Fireman's gonna die. This is a traffic jam. I need you up here, Fireman. I think these
[6265.91s -> 6279.46s]  people can explode. I don't want to end it here. Speaking of careful, nothing. All right, kill them.
[6279.46s -> 6291.37s]  Yep, they can explode. This could end real fast. One wrong explosion. All right, let's get in.
[6298.86s -> 6326.84s]  Kill them. Shank. Burn. Ah, stupid gank. Larzok has the reward.
[6331.72s -> 6342.60s]  Oh yeah, if we're doing this, he will put a socket. This is one of the best rewards in the game.
[6342.68s -> 6359.40s]  First playthrough. First playthrough, Larry. First playthrough, Andy, whatever.
[6361.00s -> 6365.69s]  Oh cool, add sockets. I could use another one in here.
[6366.65s -> 6379.08s]  Can you just waste it completely? I'm not going to use this. Even with the cold resist,
[6379.08s -> 6385.42s]  it's not very good. Maybe I'll hold on to it. All right, we've got some management to do.
[6390.06s -> 6404.89s]  We've got some management to do here. A lot of management. Oh boy, I have to sell this.
[6405.77s -> 6413.05s]  It's just, it's worthless to me. I was keeping this to, why was I keeping this?
[6413.05s -> 6425.72s]  I was making a rune word, right? Am something thul? Holy fuck, that's a lot of resist.
[6428.22s -> 6438.74s]  Rid of the extra tier. If. Eld. F. F. Get rid of it. F. These things drop all the time.
[6438.74s -> 6452.10s]  Rowl. Rowl. Rowl. Get rid of it. These flawed diamonds. Get rid of them. I just don't, I'm not,
[6452.10s -> 6459.48s]  get rid of them. They're taking up too much space. Anything flawed is out at this stage.
[6460.28s -> 6472.42s]  We're keeping complete or higher only. All right, let's dump all this shit.
[6475.43s -> 6496.58s]  Okay, if I organize this, I can make a flawless. I must have enough to make it perfect.
[6498.74s -> 6511.43s]  Flawless amethyst. Always good. Still have the leg. Thul? If I have more than one thul,
[6511.43s -> 6527.72s]  I do. Get rid of it. Hey. All right, that's a lot of light and resist. That's why I'm keeping it.
[6527.72s -> 6542.58s]  I need a rune word. What was the word? What was the rune word for this? Fire alarm? In all my years
[6543.54s -> 6553.75s]  playing Diablo II. Decades of time. I have never once thought that it was a smoke detector.
[6558.87s -> 6568.47s]  Now I do, and now I can never un-hear that. But what was the word? What was it? It was am
[6568.47s -> 6587.34s]  something thul. Anyone remember? Am-ral-thul. I have it, right? Am-ral-thul. Oh, right,
[6587.34s -> 6590.46s]  because I was waiting to see if I could find something better than a war sword.
[6590.46s -> 6606.44s]  If we just say fuck it and do it, who cares? I mean, war sword's pretty good. Am-ral-thul.
[6615.61s -> 6622.31s]  I'm doing it. It's am-ral-thul, right? Let me just look. I want to make sure I got this right.
[6623.51s -> 6639.62s]  I would hate to have this completely wrong. Okay, it's called King's Grace, right?
[6644.10s -> 6648.82s]  Am-ral-thul. Yep. All right, you ready? I don't have enough strength to use this,
[6648.82s -> 6665.83s]  but I probably will eventually. Am-ral-thul. Boom. King's Grace. 16 to 40. A huge amount of
[6665.83s -> 6674.20s]  attack rating. Tons of damage to demons. Tons of damage to undead. Adds 5 to 30 fire. Adds 3 to
[6674.20s -> 6690.94s]  14 cold. Tons of health stolen for a hit. Pretty good. Pretty good. Some of you may have joined
[6690.94s -> 6696.44s]  the stream very recently and are probably thinking to yourself, is this guy crazy?
[6696.44s -> 6702.60s]  He's- why are you- why are you doing this on a necromancer? Well, it's because I, um,
[6703.80s -> 6716.92s]  I have- I don't have any moves. I have teeth too. I don't have any abilities. Quick, do a flush.
[6717.72s -> 6734.57s]  That's stupid. All right, back up. I have- all right, let's move. The hard wall. I'm glad I beat
[6734.57s -> 6744.65s]  Diablo. The actual wall. The true wall is going to be the Ancients. If you don't know what the
[6744.65s -> 6753.72s]  Ancients are, the Ancients are- it's a boss encounter that you cannot leave. If you leave,
[6753.72s -> 6769.72s]  it resets. You have to do it in one shot. You cannot lose. So, and that's, unfortunately,
[6769.72s -> 6776.71s]  right at the end of the act. So, we're not going to know for certain. Oh wait, I was going to do
[6776.71s -> 6801.62s]  Mephisto. Yeah, let's do that. Let's go kill Mephisto. Not that good. And also jump. All right,
[6801.62s -> 6811.72s]  let's go do Mephisto. Let's pull this crew. Durance of Hate level two. Let's go. I already
[6811.72s -> 6829.85s]  know where it is. Glorious. It's up here. I wonder if this would be any easier now that I'm
[6830.41s -> 6838.70s]  10 levels higher. What, 10? 15? Am I 30? 30? Yeah, what was I? I was like level 22 when I was here.
[6843.85s -> 6848.86s]  24 maybe. It's still probably going to be hard. Somebody's blocking the door.
[6849.42s -> 6862.95s]  All right. Are you getting out of the fucking doorway? Get out of the doorway. I have Fireman
[6862.95s -> 6878.47s]  here to protect me. Yes, I do. I'm going to die to Mephisto. I'm only level 30. It's not like,
[6879.75s -> 6896.89s]  it's very possible. I have to be careful. You can drop shit. This desk is falling over here.
[6896.89s -> 6921.00s]  There we go. These guys are still pretty dangerous. That just fucking hurt a lot.
[6927.62s -> 6932.95s]  Don't run and pull. What are you guys thinking? You're just going to go pull Mephisto? You're
[6932.95s -> 6955.26s]  going to get us all killed. All right. Come here, Mephisto. Get in there. Yeah, that's just going
[6955.26s -> 6975.40s]  fine. Burn them. Come on, Fire Golem. Stay alive. Make it clean. And something good.
[6978.84s -> 6997.08s]  I think I already have those boots. Oh, no, I don't. Seagulls. Sabot. Holders is 40.
[6997.64s -> 7008.09s]  Not enough strength. Do I have anything else for Seagulls? It's very fast. Plated belt. Don't I
[7008.09s -> 7021.34s]  have? Do I have something else for Seagulls? I don't think so. Now you can finally go kill
[7021.34s -> 7043.93s]  Duriel. Yeah. All right. That was fun. Good again. No, I have, I have Catan's. These normal little
[7043.93s -> 7047.45s]  early game sets, though, if you get two or three pieces, it actually is really good.
[7049.14s -> 7053.45s]  They have a lot of good bonuses. Let's start from the beginning.
[7055.27s -> 7058.79s]  Impossible. Let's try to sell the cube. I'm glad you can't do that.
[7059.59s -> 7088.65s]  Barrens of Hate level two. Again. No, don't pick up blood. My army. We're back. Back in business.
[7089.21s -> 7103.98s]  Let's go. Get hit right in the head. Do I have potions?
[7107.38s -> 7119.13s]  Get caught up here. I gotta get potions. That hurts. Yeah, I need.
[7121.69s -> 7133.16s]  Even if they're shitty, I don't care. Yes. No, just get the good ones. Just get the good ones.
[7139.91s -> 7147.50s]  The best part of this game is that it is not Warcraft remastered.
[7159.61s -> 7165.74s]  Uh, I guess, I guess I follow you. I think I, I pick up what you're putting down here.
[7172.04s -> 7176.60s]  Reforged. Reforged. It's not, hey, it wasn't, it's not a remaster.
[7177.56s -> 7185.40s]  That's where you guys got it all wrong. It was reforged. That means that's a made-up term
[7185.96s -> 7206.41s]  that it could mean anything. It's not Warcraft remade or remake remastered. No, it's reforged.
[7206.97s -> 7214.17s]  I thought you guys got that when we announced it. Oh, by the way,
[7214.17s -> 7220.23s]  you can never play the original ever again. We had to, we reforged the damn thing.
[7231.19s -> 7248.86s]  We didn't teleport, did we? Fireman died. Poor Fireman. Gave up. Again, here let's go.
[7250.23s -> 7256.15s]  Hey, Mephisto, remember us? We're here. We're here for the diamonds. We're here for the jewels.
[7257.11s -> 7301.10s]  I just get to watch. It's not even worth picking up. We're gonna do it five times.
[7301.66s -> 7312.44s]  This'll be number three. And then we'll go, we'll do the next quest in Act 5. We'll do this five
[7312.44s -> 7324.12s]  times. Man, the times that I wish I was a sorceress. One of them is right now. It's boom,
[7324.12s -> 7335.61s]  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Exit game. Enter game. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[7337.77s -> 7359.05s]  Exit game. Enter game. All righty, people. Careful.
[7360.01s -> 7385.03s]  Easy. The mages just died so quickly. These mages are getting beat up. You guys dead? Come on,
[7385.03s -> 7398.54s]  guys. Clean it up a little bit here. This is embarrassing. The same hardcore run it is.
[7399.26s -> 7409.24s]  It is still hardcore. I've not died yet on this character. All that could change in an instant.
[7417.98s -> 7443.00s]  Okay, let's go. Look, I'm helping this time. Okay, so I just dropped a meteor.
[7446.47s -> 7466.82s]  Hold on here. Hold on here. It's getting a little hairy. Not clean. Not clean. Heavy boots. Boots
[7466.82s -> 7484.68s]  again? Sanders. 40%. These are actually kind of good. Sanders riprap. These are really good
[7484.68s -> 7500.01s]  actually. Do I have anything else from Sanders? I'm gonna put these on. 40% faster run. Bunch of
[7500.01s -> 7516.92s]  strength in decks. Oh my god, I fucking vroom. Don't I already have? Yeah, I have stealth too.
[7517.80s -> 7523.99s]  Well, I can do this faster now. Yeah. Why am I not opening the chest back here? Why has nobody
[7523.99s -> 7531.22s]  corrected me? Where are all the Diablo 2 veterans in here that should be correcting me to get the
[7531.22s -> 7560.10s]  chest back here? Because it could be unique. I remember being like a Sunday afternoon and I
[7560.10s -> 7574.62s]  was on my like 40th Mephisto run. I had a fresh Mountain Dew Code Red. I was just in my element.
[7579.67s -> 7587.58s]  It was just so much fun. It was in my element. Somebody would come into the room,
[7588.78s -> 7594.20s]  spam a Diablo 2 item scam website 10 times, and then instantly leave.
[7596.30s -> 7616.89s]  Ugh, those are the days. Oh my god, don't die. Reminiscing is gonna kill me. I do, I remember.
[7616.89s -> 7624.63s]  I remember having to have a password protected private game or every 10 seconds a new account
[7624.63s -> 7631.45s]  that was a keyboard smash name would come in and talk about how much percent off their wind forces
[7631.45s -> 7656.70s]  were. I remember also, God bless my mother. God bless my mother because I remember being like
[7656.70s -> 7669.03s]  15 and wanting to buy a wind force and I was trying to explain to my mother why I had to
[7669.11s -> 7681.24s]  have this thing. And she just shook her head and said, that is absurd. You don't need that.
[7682.39s -> 7696.46s]  And I was like, no, but I do, but my character, come on. And she refused to do it. It didn't
[7696.46s -> 7701.42s]  matter how much I was like, no, but mom, by the way, I was 15, not like six. So I don't know why
[7701.42s -> 7716.63s]  I'm doing like a come on mommy voice. I was like fucking a teenager. I was like 15. I was, I was,
[7716.63s -> 7737.21s]  I had to have been fucking like, oh no, stop, stop, stop, stop. Where's my fire friend?
[7745.22s -> 7772.63s]  Hold on. I just need to never talk ever again. Um, my mom, I was a teenager at the time.
[7773.43s -> 7783.83s]  She told me it wasn't worth it and it was a stupid thing to do. To buy this item from the
[7783.83s -> 7819.98s]  Diablo 2 scam website. Your mom had a big brain. I think a wind force, wind force was like,
[7819.98s -> 7829.06s]  don't die. I think a wind force was like 200 bucks. It's crazy. Oh, wait, that's actually a head.
[7831.88s -> 7835.56s]  They were expensive. They were like more than a hundred bucks or something. They had to have
[7835.56s -> 7853.59s]  been. I remember freedom life tap. Oh, hooray. One more. You were a pretty stupid 15 year old.
[7855.13s -> 7860.02s]  Um, no, just the wind force was one of the hardest things to get in the whole game.
[7861.54s -> 7870.31s]  Wind force was just the unobtainable. It was that one bow that was the best bow.
[7871.75s -> 7879.35s]  All it would have done would be to let me to use strafe and kill cows faster.
[7879.91s -> 7894.65s]  That's all I was doing. So in 2020 hindsight, no, it definitely was not worth it. I just wanted
[7894.65s -> 7902.54s]  to be able to farm because I wanted to find the runes. Yep. It was to be able to farm cows.
[7903.18s -> 7916.06s]  All right, this is the last one. It's 55 cents now. I would not put my credit card into a website
[7916.06s -> 7933.74s]  still selling Diablo 2 items for 50 cents. I don't think that would be a good idea for me.
[7940.84s -> 7948.30s]  Come on, man. It's a steel. It's a wind force.
[7950.39s -> 7958.92s]  Oh, fuck. I can't let this be on the tombstone.
[7959.88s -> 7967.53s]  I'd rather die to the ancients than die farming Mephisto. That's embarrassing on the tombstone.
[7994.84s -> 8001.96s]  Yo, they're gonna be a pain in the ass still. All right, let's get council number two.
[8001.96s -> 8015.29s]  Your mom probably bought the wind forces and got you banned. My account wasn't banned until recently.
[8016.49s -> 8027.05s]  Played Diablo 2 a year ago. Just installed it to check it out for the first time in a while.
[8034.71s -> 8046.50s]  What you think? You think my mother now did this? My mother in 2020? That would be sort of strange.
[8048.82s -> 8056.58s]  Mom trying to get my account banned. Mom got my account banned. That's like a YouTube video.
[8061.18s -> 8066.04s]  Guys, my mom sold gold on my Warcraft account banned.
[8078.01s -> 8085.03s]  Come on, give us a unique. This is five times. I've spun the slot machine five times. I want something.
[8085.99s -> 8110.42s]  Give me something. Ouch. One more. That one didn't count. All blues doesn't count.
[8130.36s -> 8131.72s]  Jesus, that was stupid.
[8136.65s -> 8158.90s]  Where are my friends? I'm about to exit the game. It's because there's a champion in here.
[8159.70s -> 8174.55s]  Wait, were there two champions? What the fuck? You guys didn't kill it? All right, well look, come on.
[8176.86s -> 8201.26s]  Let's go. Big co-op juke. Nice. Nice. That's what I like to see. Follow me.
[8201.74s -> 8211.94s]  All right, let's go. I can run faster than them. I can run faster than them. Just run.
[8213.45s -> 8247.64s]  I have super speed. Use it. All right, now slow down. Do I have any healing potions?
[8247.64s -> 8251.58s]  I think I have to go back to town. All right, let's see if I can just do this without getting hit.
[8254.81s -> 8279.75s]  Just don't get hit. Just don't get hit. All there is to it. Let me adjust the boomer belt. Adjust it.
[8282.68s -> 8301.70s]  Just. Also terrible. Let's go. Last one. No matter what happens is it. Who cares. It'll be it. No more.
[8306.54s -> 8349.58s]  Everybody in attacking me. Don't do that. Ow. And unique. Ah, no. I can't do it again. No, I can't.
[8354.50s -> 8372.54s]  I'm just gonna get there very quickly. Hold on.
[8378.33s -> 8400.50s]  Maybe I should change it up. Should I do Undariel or something? Player count?
[8400.50s -> 8415.10s]  Yeah, but that's dangerous though. I'll do players. Players four. You can call me a
[8415.10s -> 8424.49s]  coward or you won. I mean, there's eight. Let's see if players four. If I can do players four, then I'll
[8425.61s -> 8438.44s]  keep going. Dude, and this is gonna be. No, no, no, no. Bad idea. That's a really, really bad idea right
[8438.44s -> 8467.18s]  now. No, no, that's so bad. Players 200. Let's go. I'm just gonna try it around there. I have a no
[8467.18s -> 8489.59s]  shit button. Almost there. Good. No, uh, no little guys to screw it all up. Here we are. Now we're
[8489.59s -> 8501.32s]  gonna take this slow. I can't hurt these guys. I'm gonna be solely reliant on the companions,
[8501.32s -> 8518.58s]  which has to be like that anyways. Footstep sounds kill me. I can't even hear footsteps on.
[8518.58s -> 8537.10s]  Oh, no, I do. Yeah, I do. It's like, damn, I don't appreciate your passive aggressive tone, Jerma.
[8538.14s -> 8569.94s]  What the fuck are you talking about? Players four. Where is it? Jerma's weird. I mean, yeah,
[8570.02s -> 8579.66s]  kind of am. Whatever. I don't think I'm that weird. I don't think I'd do anything that out
[8579.66s -> 8595.61s]  of the ordinary that a normal person wouldn't wouldn't do. That's what they all say. Yeah.
[8596.41s -> 8610.38s]  So what? That's true. Just in case I die. I can't, I, I, I, I, I'm dead if I die. There is no coming
[8610.38s -> 8620.63s]  back. I got to heal the, uh, I got to heal Vic. Come back here. Vic is healed. Stay the fuck out
[8620.63s -> 8635.18s]  of the way. He's going to one by one take out every skeleton. He's going to kill. It's gonna
[8635.18s -> 8661.24s]  take a while. Why are you killing this guy in one hit? Vic, you good? Just Vic, you just do it.
[8661.24s -> 8676.95s]  You'll be fine. I think he's healing himself. Use it now. He's got that pole. He goes down.
[8676.95s -> 8681.35s]  There it is. Heal him. Oh my God. He's fucking gonna die.
[8687.94s -> 8708.66s]  Kill him. I can press shift. Yeah, that's right. Come on, Vic. All right. Unique.
[8709.38s -> 8727.91s]  Get some bad luck here. Usually you get like one. Usually you get one unique. I just had to
[8727.91s -> 8735.56s]  stretch for that one. That's it. I'm not doing another one. I'm not doing another Mephisto run.
[8735.56s -> 8740.76s]  That's it. No more Mephisto runs. Didn't say anything about not doing an Andariel run.
[8741.32s -> 8761.37s]  That runs so fast.
[8788.68s -> 8810.28s]  Okay, minor mana potions. All right, get in here. Uh, Andariel is going to be pretty easy.
[8813.19s -> 8823.38s]  Should be. Do I not have any magic find? I, I do not really, but it's hard to get at this stage.
[8824.26s -> 8828.84s]  I could make a moonward maybe with that magic find on it. I think I have like
[8828.84s -> 8835.32s]  20-30%. You need like, you need to have more than 100% to really do runs efficiently.
[8836.28s -> 8853.18s]  But I don't have any. I'm just trying to do it straight up. Shit. Thought it was a different
[8853.18s -> 8866.44s]  rune. Oh well. All right, let's go get her. Hello. Killer. He's like already almost dead.
[8867.40s -> 8874.22s]  All right, Andariel. Drop a unique. You dropped so much shit and none of it's a unique.
[8887.34s -> 8897.62s]  It's all like level eight. Level four. Player count, player counts at four. I could do eight.
[8897.62s -> 8902.58s]  I could do player count eight with Andariel. You know what? Let's do that. Let's just do that.
[8902.58s -> 8926.25s]  Let's do that right now. Player's eight. Definitely can do eight plays with Andariel.
[8926.25s -> 8960.50s]  That shouldn't be a problem. Just to hope it's not. Easy. Okay. Oh, we're fine. Can I get it?
[8961.30s -> 8988.02s]  Good. I'm fast. Best part about a unique, it doesn't matter what act or where in the game
[8988.02s -> 8994.50s]  you find it. Well, not entirely true. But for all the normal uniques, they could drop anywhere.
[8995.30s -> 8998.95s]  There are a lot of uniques that only drop in Nightmare in Hell difficulty, but
[8999.51s -> 9003.59s]  it's not like I'm going to get like a level two unique. That sucks. All uniques are pretty good
[9004.55s -> 9016.39s]  for the most part. Open the door. I mean, in normal, like if you're like level 20, level 30,
[9016.39s -> 9021.91s]  level 40, a lot of normal uniques can carry you. I mean, take a look. I've had this on the whole
[9021.91s -> 9035.16s]  time. I've had this on since level 10. I haven't taken it off. I haven't needed to. All right.
[9035.16s -> 9041.34s]  Eight players. I'm about scared. I was when I first came in here. What did I have? Three
[9041.34s -> 9054.82s]  skeletons. That's not even a challenge. Not even a challenge. Unique. If everybody in the chat says
[9054.82s -> 9065.43s]  it at the same time, it might happen. Everybody in the chat say unique. Nobody. You guys didn't say
[9065.43s -> 9118.79s]  it. Not enough people said it. Oh no. We failed you. Hello. Do a Diablo run. Impossible. Let's go.
[9118.79s -> 9135.99s]  Mephisto. Done. Coming back to act five. Last one. Truly, truly the final one. Truly with certainty.
[9135.99s -> 9145.50s]  And then we'll do the next part of act five.
[9166.15s -> 9167.59s]  Make me laugh, E-clown.
[9192.02s -> 9204.57s]  No, you have to do a joke now. No, I don't want to. I don't want to. No, I'm okay.
[9204.81s -> 9222.84s]  Let's play a game. I gotta level up from doing this. That should be good. Gotta power up the
[9222.84s -> 9237.91s]  funny crystal. My funny crystal. Pull up from this. Whoa. That's bad. That's lower resist all.
[9239.03s -> 9251.66s]  No, he killed everybody. That's one you don't want to see. That's not a good one. You don't
[9251.66s -> 9261.59s]  want to see that pop up. Weaken. Resist lower. It sucks. Still not anything here though. Let's go
[9261.59s -> 9279.00s]  this way. It's locked. When he said Diablo resident sleeper. Opening up the box is the most
[9279.00s -> 9289.62s]  interesting thing you've ever seen. And you mean to tell me that killing Mephisto seven times in
[9289.62s -> 9300.86s]  a row is not the most exciting thing in the world. Oh, you get to see like yellow text hit the ground.
[9301.82s -> 9318.44s]  What are you talking about? All right. Just keep a big alive. Amateur hour. Only seven.
[9319.88s -> 9333.11s]  This should level up. You finally get to pick something because you picked the least entertaining
[9333.11s -> 9344.18s]  play style. I didn't pick. Probably should have put that in the title. This is not going to do
[9344.18s -> 9392.15s]  with me. No, don't die. Stay alive. Oh, well. Level nine. Get the fuck out of here with this shit.
[9392.15s -> 9411.00s]  Level nine? Level three? This is act three. All right. Take a look. That's not correct. That's
[9411.00s -> 9425.86s]  the runeword website. Those are the cheats. Okay. That's better. Wait. No, it's not because I remember
[9425.86s -> 9429.22s]  we had to zoom in. I didn't even click this either. What the hell am I thinking?
[9429.86s -> 9443.21s]  Let me fix this. All right, guys. Pick the next point, please. Make it a good one.
[9444.09s -> 9496.84s]  What do you want to do? Please choose wisely. Okay. Revive. I didn't. I'm surprised. I thought,
[9496.84s -> 9507.32s]  okay. Somebody said, I want the one that looks like a big poop. None of the three of these that
[9507.32s -> 9518.20s]  have been clicked remotely resemble that. Not even close. Which one of these are you looking at?
[9519.08s -> 9534.18s]  Okay. We're doing revive. Pretty good choice. Thanks for voting. Now, what about this?
[9535.30s -> 9559.82s]  Bunny Poo Poo streamer. Omega Low. No, it's Bunny Poo Poo chat members. How much do I actually have
[9559.82s -> 9591.67s]  strength? Okay. Strength it is. Strength it is. I can now use that sword and I can use the
[9591.67s -> 9604.15s]  something else too with 70, right? What else is 70? Something else is 70. Is revive.
[9605.11s -> 9625.35s]  I need to put that on the bar. Let's do, let's see. F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6 can be revived.
[9625.99s -> 9634.92s]  So revive does this. You'll see in just a second. See these guys? He's Blood Lord.
[9635.88s -> 9644.94s]  When he dies, I have Blood Lord. They have the same moves. They do everything the exact same,
[9644.94s -> 9670.86s]  except they're yours. Very, very useful. All right. It's time to continue to play the game
[9672.36s -> 9678.57s]  after a pee break and go for about three hours. Let's, let's take a break. I'll be back in like
[9678.57s -> 9987.83s]  two minutes, three minutes. Let us continue. Oh, the last thing we did was the Virgin of
[9987.83s -> 9995.35s]  Island. We have a revive. Where is he? There he is. See? Isn't he cool? He just like floats around
[9995.35s -> 10019.32s]  and it could be anybody. It could be anyone. Oh, my sword. I'll get it in a second. Oh, he's dead?
[10020.52s -> 10029.34s]  Oh my God. They're getting stomped. We have strength in numbers, not individual strength.
[10030.06s -> 10049.51s]  Come on, guys. Somebody kill somebody. Oh, damn it. I thought it was going to be good.
[10051.45s -> 10061.77s]  Doesn't look very good. Oh, for the love of God, it's on players eight.
[10062.57s -> 10075.18s]  It's like, why are we getting our asses kicked? This shouldn't be happening.
[10075.18s -> 10117.91s]  What? Did it get this much harder? All right. Now we got the whole crew. Let's go. All right.
[10117.91s -> 10131.86s]  Two players. I too live in an evil demon hut. We'll get, we'll get the heck out of there.
[10132.90s -> 10162.12s]  We got a big guy now. Let that guy out. Why? Oh, find the soldiers in the Virgin of Highland.
[10162.12s -> 10165.64s]  So there are soldiers locked up that we have to find and help and rescue.
[10167.00s -> 10182.15s]  Need to rescue them. A battle going on. Oh, man. I can't even tell who's friend or foe right now.
[10182.15s -> 10195.16s]  All right. Time to go back. Do you think he realizes how dumb he is? What? By doing what?
[10204.36s -> 10210.62s]  I normally might agree with you, but what are we talking about? Can I do the cow level?
[10210.62s -> 10218.58s]  Cause I'm winning because I've beaten Diablo. Wait, I don't think he would. What do you mean?
[10218.58s -> 10231.14s]  He doesn't realize. What do you mean? What did I do? What happened? It needs to be Bill.
[10235.72s -> 10254.87s]  Do you, is it Diablo or Bill? He just doesn't get it. Oh, I guess not. I need to have potions.
[10256.71s -> 10268.01s]  Potions please. Potions please. Thank you. He just doesn't get it. I wish we could make him see.
[10275.27s -> 10301.56s]  Oh, 46 to 121 versus 37 to 106. A shitload of everything else. This can now go away. I can
[10301.64s -> 10318.38s]  use this, but why would I? He's a much better. We could make him understand.
[10319.10s -> 10340.52s]  If only we could just make him understand. See? Right there.
[10346.25s -> 10352.47s]  I'm just going to pretend like you guys are just making a joke and you're trying to get me to go,
[10352.47s -> 10354.95s]  what are you talking about? Which is what already happened. So you already did it.
[10355.91s -> 10357.51s]  You've already done it. You did a good job.
[10360.98s -> 10368.89s]  Saved one. I need two more. Two more soldier
[10370.49s -> 10394.58s]  prisons. Two more. Difficulty. I mean, I have it on players too. I mean, it's extra experience
[10394.58s -> 10403.05s]  and we can handle it. We can handle it. You haven't changed the difficulty. I changed it twice.
[10404.01s -> 10426.82s]  What? Yes, I did. I forgot the slash the first time. Didn't I put it on two
[10427.54s -> 10435.16s]  after four? I fixed it. At least I thought I did. You never set it to four.
[10439.24s -> 10453.08s]  I still like it. Another camp right here. Let's get it. Breathe. Oh shit. Hold on. That's death.
[10453.96s -> 10477.61s]  I want the big guy. Hey, Vic leveled up. Good. My mana is so bad. It's just bad. All right. That's
[10477.61s -> 10498.49s]  a unique. That's a... One more. All right. Kill this champion, please. I have 100% more damage
[10498.49s -> 10507.83s]  to demons. Look at how much I'm melting this guy. Did you see that? I have 100% more damage to demons
[10507.83s -> 10515.34s]  and undead. I may as well be unkillable. I may as well have put it on players
[10515.34s -> 10522.26s]  50 because there's no way I'm going to lose ever again. I mean, like, geez, it's just not fair.
[10522.26s -> 10538.78s]  I just uninstall the game. I'm looking for another prison. Looking for another prison.
[10540.54s -> 10556.52s]  Yell if you see one. I don't think it would be that much further down than this.
[10556.52s -> 10580.31s]  I thought it could be. How am I this powerful? You struggle with the necro on normal?
[10585.34s -> 10600.07s]  I'm not sure I am. I mean, I'm pretty weak, to be honest. Abaddon. Just a random dungeon.
[10600.79s -> 10606.73s]  I'm not looking for Abaddon, though. We're looking for another... We're looking for another
[10607.85s -> 10610.57s]  barbarian camp, which for some reason we can't find.
[10610.57s -> 10628.94s]  I'm so fast. I can just ski around at, like, 75% extra speed. No, it's definitely down.
[10630.06s -> 10641.35s]  It's definitely not this far up. What's my favorite PS2 game?
[10648.42s -> 10660.25s]  Uh, I don't know. That's a pretty good question. I have no idea. I don't have any idea.
[10661.21s -> 10676.79s]  Tony Hawk's Underground? No. I don't know. That's what you get in, like, an hour.
[10677.51s -> 10693.93s]  Maybe I'll be able to come up with something then. All right. Barbarian camp. Barbarian camp.
[10699.82s -> 10707.05s]  I thought I would have bet all my chips that it was right there. I would have lost all my chips.
[10708.65s -> 10714.17s]  And then I would have fucking slowly been like, okay, cool. Thanks for the game. Thanks for the
[10714.17s -> 10721.99s]  game, guys. And I'd just slowly get up from the chair and go to my car. Yep. Bye-bye. See you later.
[10721.99s -> 10729.54s]  Fun night. And the door closed in the car. And I'd be like, haha, let's go home.
[10732.95s -> 10749.22s]  Just fucking, just bullsh- scream. What's my favorite chip? Fake Blaze.
[10750.74s -> 10758.47s]  You're doing the YouTuber voice at the poker table. You deserve to lose your chips.
[10761.00s -> 10768.07s]  I didn't go into the poker table or like the blackjack table and be like, okay, sounds good.
[10769.80s -> 10774.04s]  So what's that, 11? I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to double down on that one.
[10775.22s -> 10793.72s]  It would be like, shut the fuck up. I'm sorry? Oh, so I can't hear you. The YouTuber voice.
[10793.72s -> 10799.40s]  Where is this other barbarian camp? Or should I say, where is this other barbarian camp?
[10800.20s -> 10806.33s]  Let me try, I'll translate it. I'll translate everything into YouTube for you guys.
[10806.33s -> 10846.76s]  Just in case anyone didn't know. Where is anybody? Bring back the voice actor frog.
[10849.34s -> 10862.84s]  I don't think I could do that. I'm not sure we'll see him again. He didn't, he did not like,
[10862.84s -> 10872.90s]  he was not happy on that stream. He was very angry with me. I apparently, I quote, put him on the
[10872.90s -> 10894.14s]  spot. And he said, it would be as if I called you to come over my house to stream from my house
[10894.14s -> 10923.29s]  on my channel as you. And I laughed in his face. Don't call me ever again. Retell the joke,
[10923.29s -> 10930.90s]  I missed it. Yeah. But that frog actor is not going to come back. Weirdly enough,
[10931.86s -> 10951.14s]  when's Bugleberry coming back? When he makes his album called Scare and Through the 70s.
[10954.60s -> 10961.37s]  10 hits sung by Bugleberry himself of his own writing based on original characters he wrote
[10961.93s -> 10977.40s]  and drew. He drew these characters on his paper like he like artists that draw and drew them.
[10986.52s -> 10989.72s]  I need to find these barbarians before I lose my mind.
[10990.44s -> 11001.69s]  No, I want this guy. I don't want you. Come on. Barbarians. Barbarians. I need one more.
[11002.33s -> 11036.41s]  Where are they? Bugleberry. Bugleberry. Give me this way. Bugleberry sucks. No, he doesn't.
[11037.13s -> 11049.11s]  I can't believe you guys didn't like him. He was so sad. Hey, hey, hey. He made his $40.
[11050.07s -> 11072.78s]  Okay. And when I handed him the money, I gave him two 20s. He was like, two 20s. Whoa, whoa,
[11072.78s -> 11078.39s]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He was like really fucking VIP. Excited about it. It was like he'd
[11078.39s -> 11089.67s]  never seen that much money before in his life. It was really weird. I mean, I can't do the impression
[11089.67s -> 11099.62s]  well, but you know. And he called me from his car and he asked me if I still had one of the 20s.
[11101.54s -> 11108.42s]  I said no. He said, I'll do my best here. Well, I only have one. Are you sure?
[11109.22s -> 11113.46s]  Somewhere along the way, he lost one of the 20s. I don't know how. We put them both in the same
[11113.46s -> 11121.64s]  pocket. I don't understand. It was within five minutes of me handing it to him. And I'm like,
[11121.64s -> 11140.15s]  dude, I paid you. I can't. I'm not going to give you another 20. And then he called again
[11140.15s -> 11144.63s]  that night and he asked, he had, he just real quick wanted me to ask me what kind of dog I had.
[11144.63s -> 11149.32s]  What was the breed? I don't think he was under the assumption that he was going to buy a dog with
[11149.32s -> 11164.98s]  $40 for 20. He's a weird guy. All right. Got them all. That's good.
[11185.80s -> 11197.74s]  He just wanted a puppy. We've been hating on him.
[11197.74s -> 11212.82s]  You're so mean. Bugleberry is a good person. I cannot speak to Bugleberry's character.
[11212.82s -> 11221.40s]  The guy carries around urns of demons and shit. You know how long it took after the Halloween
[11221.40s -> 11245.05s]  stream to get that fucking thing back inside of its dwelling. An hour? No.
[11250.18s -> 11257.51s]  Probably three weeks. This motherfucker put on like costumes and was running around,
[11257.51s -> 11264.79s]  was going to the bank and shit. We had to tail him in his Bugleberry's fucking shitty old car.
[11273.16s -> 11305.30s]  Fucking stupid. Maybe you should check in with him sometimes. Oh, don't worry. He checks in with me
[11307.93s -> 11320.34s]  all the time actually. And I answer the phone every time and we talk because we're fucking
[11320.34s -> 11348.94s]  old friends. I love Bugleberry. He's the best. You know, I've got this great, great plan for Bugleberry.
[11351.62s -> 11362.66s]  I can't wait. It's going to be awesome. I cannot wait. If only I could tell you.
[11370.87s -> 11379.11s]  If only I could tell you what the plan is for Bugleberry. A lot of you would actually probably
[11379.11s -> 11405.00s]  really have. Because I am. We lack critical information.
[11409.40s -> 11428.39s]  I have big bits. Oh, freak out. Freak. How many times did you do this? One, two, three,
[11428.39s -> 11440.02s]  four. Did you just give two, what, a hundred dollars? All right. Freak out just gave
[11440.02s -> 11452.76s]  a hundred dollars worth of bits. There's a lot of information here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11452.92s -> 11464.82s]  This is, this is confusing me. First of all, thanks for the hundred dollars.
[11467.78s -> 11471.78s]  Jeremy, I've been watching you for a few years. Have you ever seen a professional RC car race?
[11472.50s -> 11479.35s]  I have not. Here you go. Speaking of cars, when was the last time you worked on your car? I don't.
[11480.28s -> 11484.04s]  I know it might seem like a steep hill to climb, but I've been working for a Honda as a technician
[11484.04s -> 11490.63s]  for a few months now. Why do I feel like this is not real? I don't think this is, I don't know,
[11490.63s -> 11499.45s]  I don't think this is real. I think this is made up. I can guide you along the way. The
[11499.45s -> 11504.20s]  following is a list of things anybody can check without having to buy any, any expensive tools.
[11504.20s -> 11511.00s]  Wiper blades, washer fluid, engine filter and cabin AC filter, battery terminals, drive belt,
[11511.00s -> 11518.89s]  front rear brake pads, tire tread, transmission fluid. I'm not going to do any of this. No,
[11518.89s -> 11525.78s]  I just drop it off and I say, please fix my car, sir. And then they charge me $1,500 for like,
[11526.42s -> 11537.51s]  that's what I do. Anti-freeze power steering fluid, tire pressure. If you find any of these
[11537.51s -> 11540.87s]  are in need of any attention or replacement, you should bring it to a local dealership or
[11540.87s -> 11544.86s]  certified mechanic. Or if you want, you can try to replace it yourself. Hey, that would be a great
[11544.86s -> 11549.90s]  idea for a stream. Or if you do decide to do it yourself, you should take any and all precautions,
[11549.90s -> 11559.45s]  even after working on cars for almost a year. The smell of these fluids will make me gag.
[11559.45s -> 11582.52s]  You motherfucker, you motherfucker. I don't think I'm going to be, I don't think I'm going to be
[11582.52s -> 11592.74s]  uh, reading any more messages from Mr. Freakout. I think, uh, I think we've, I think we've hit the
[11592.74s -> 11605.27s]  wall here talking about the codes. Uh, I'm not, I'm not going to give any more codes.
[11605.91s -> 11623.34s]  This is the porn guy, by the way, for those of you that are curious, the porn guy. I will answer
[11623.34s -> 11629.58s]  this one question though. I will give this to you. Uh, they want to ask how many towels I use on a
[11629.58s -> 11643.75s]  weekly basis. One. Showering. I mean, that's a weird question, but I mean, one. I think, uh,
[11643.75s -> 11654.71s]  God damn it, man. What the flying fuck. Who uses one towel? One for every, no, one for like,
[11654.71s -> 11660.54s]  showering. I don't know. What does that mean? How many towels do you use on a weekly basis? Like,
[11660.54s -> 11667.11s]  what, if I go to a pool, I'll use an extra towel. If I, like, yeah, I don't know. I use one towel
[11667.11s -> 11681.61s]  a week every like three or four days, replace a towel. That's normal. You use a towel to wash
[11681.61s -> 11687.16s]  your dishes and a shower. No, we, we're not, we, we have not, you're playing semantics now.
[11687.72s -> 11696.06s]  Like, I'm thinking of how many towels I use in the bath, like tub. I use one towel to like
[11696.06s -> 11702.79s]  shower, get out, dry off. Three, four days will go by, use another one. You got to conserve water.
[11702.95s -> 11710.01s]  You're going to just, you're going to wash a towel every day? You made the second part up.
[11710.01s -> 11718.63s]  What do you mean? What? That's two. He doesn't wash dishes. No, you use a different towel. Okay,
[11719.35s -> 11724.60s]  there's a dish towel. There's a bath towel. These are two, they're two separate entities
[11724.60s -> 11730.68s]  that they're used for different things. Okay, I use a dish towel. One. You know, who, why are we
[11730.68s -> 11741.11s]  even talking about this? Uh, thank you, freak out for the hunt, for like the $500 in porn messages
[11742.07s -> 11748.54s]  and the tips on cars. But I'm sad to say I'm not, I'm not going, I will not be reading
[11748.54s -> 11756.33s]  one of your messages again. That's, that, that you, you popped out to the pitcher on this last
[11756.33s -> 11770.25s]  message. You popped out to the pitcher and he caught it. You swung it right in the air and it
[11770.25s -> 11776.44s]  was caught. You're out. You're out. That's it. I really appreciate it though, but you're out.
[11777.08s -> 11814.26s]  No, all right. You, you, you can, you link a bunch of porn codes twice, two different times.
[11814.26s -> 11821.30s]  And the third time you reference explicitly the porn codes that strike three men.
[11821.94s -> 11848.28s]  At some point you got to strike out. That's why he's naked. Um, oh yeah. This is on hardcore. I
[11848.28s -> 11878.66s]  can't do that. What kind of weirdo would wear a backpack and a t-shirt?
[11881.46s -> 11890.33s]  Some of you new viewers don't get it. No. All right. I have to stand up guys. I'm wearing a
[11890.33s -> 11918.82s]  boomer brace. See, I'm wearing a backpack and a fanny cap, a fanny pack. And you know, and you
[11918.82s -> 11957.46s]  know it. You know it. It's right there. Oh, oh, oh, oh, the bionic boomer. Another one? Really?
[11958.26s -> 11964.66s]  That was just like a bug. I can't even do it. Yeah. I've done it. Okay. I have to wink too
[11964.66s -> 11974.82s]  many times. I can't, I don't know how to do it anymore. These are scam winks. Whatever. I want
[11974.82s -> 12001.00s]  to do, I want to turn this in. I think the wink experience has been a, has been a failure.
[12001.96s -> 12013.06s]  Has it? Oh, I got a ring. Oh no, he gave me Raal-Ort-Tal. Raal-Ort-Tal. If only I had a
[12013.06s -> 12019.99s]  shock and a shield. That's what he says. Uh, look for Anya under the crystalline passage by the
[12019.99s -> 12026.26s]  frozen river. Anya is one of the townspeople here. She's trapped in ice. 100,000 points to show Otto.
[12026.26s -> 12033.75s]  No, I'm not gonna like drag my dog in here. I'm not gonna like channel point my dog into the room
[12034.92s -> 12038.84s]  and like pick him up. And no, that's like not, I don't want to do that to him. That's not nice.
[12040.39s -> 12045.83s]  Hey Otto, somebody gave a 10,000, 100,000 points. Come here. You look at the camera.
[12047.18s -> 12066.10s]  You know, he's not, he's not a toy. I don't want to do that to him. All right, crystalline.
[12066.10s -> 12072.14s]  Where's my, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. He's a dog. He's not going to get mad
[12072.14s -> 12078.79s]  if you pick him up. All right. You see how many winks happen a stream? It's at least like six or
[12078.79s -> 12084.17s]  seven. I don't want to like pick him up and put him down, pick him up, put him down, pick him up.
[12084.17s -> 12104.42s]  Plus I got, guys, I have a back brace on now. I can't do that anymore. I can't even move. Stuck
[12104.42s -> 12120.92s]  in the chair forever. Forever. How about a nose cam? All right, we need to go to the crystalline
[12120.92s -> 12125.88s]  passage by the frozen river. It's, I believe it's just to keep going up. Boys, up to the right.
[12125.88s -> 12150.31s]  Once, once you start to see frozen stuff. Hey, you know, we're there. Somebody just asked us,
[12150.31s -> 12155.83s]  does Otto know any tricks? Yeah. You know, sit, he knows, lie down, he knows, roll over.
[12158.17s -> 12171.22s]  He can do a lot of stuff. Kim actually taught Otto a lot of stuff. I think it's up here. He's very
[12171.22s -> 12178.34s]  smart. Well, he's very motivated, to put it that way. If you have a little treat in your hand,
[12178.34s -> 12182.42s]  he will do whatever you want. He'll be like, let's go. I know every trick now.
[12182.82s -> 12197.53s]  Without a treat, he's just like, nah. You're like, hey, Otto, roll over. He's like, no, why?
[12198.41s -> 12206.39s]  Like, roll over, Otto. No, I don't have anything I want. Why would I? He's smart.
[12208.92s -> 12224.95s]  He's like, I only do that with shit that I want. It's like his streamer dad.
[12225.83s -> 12256.68s]  Quest reward. What's Otto's alignment? Um, dog. I think dog is its own alignment, don't you think?
[12257.56s -> 12274.18s]  I need more. I feel like I have people, but not a lot of people. How? I'm being overwhelmed.
[12274.98s -> 12287.19s]  German is only funny when you give him money. That's not true.
[12296.73s -> 12303.80s]  All right, let's keep moving. Almost level 30. What? 32? Cool. All right. First align passage.
[12304.44s -> 12307.66s]  We need to go in. It's not this way. A little bit further up, I think.
[12308.54s -> 12321.64s]  Tip of Archeron. Nope. There it is. Streamer, be mad for me. Um, I can do that. Yeah. Uh,
[12322.36s -> 12328.28s]  just open up twitch.tv slash German nine eight five. Go to the videos tab.
[12329.32s -> 12336.34s]  Uh, click. Oh yeah. Click on, uh, click on the Tony Hawk underground stream
[12337.53s -> 12354.92s]  and fast forward to about nine hours into the stream and then let go and watch this thing sucks.
[12360.73s -> 12370.20s]  The poison's all right, but just go watch the jump king stream. I'm glad I caught that live.
[12371.16s -> 12376.87s]  I'm glad he caught it live too. I thought it was fun. I did. All right, here we go.
[12376.87s -> 12382.84s]  Crystal line passage. Now we're fucking, this is no longer a joke now.
[12385.24s -> 12391.21s]  Once we get through here, this is where we're going to see if I have what it takes to win.
[12392.17s -> 12411.30s]  It's only muted for like 20 minutes. That's really good actually. It's only muted for 20 minutes,
[12411.30s -> 12418.84s]  about 10 and a half hours. What songs got grabbed? What did anybody know? We've got, uh,
[12421.18s -> 12444.38s]  they killed all the skill ups. Level up. Can't revive champions, unfortunately. That'd be nice.
[12456.10s -> 12476.60s]  Oh shit. I forgot that's the, that spawns a champion. All right. Let's, uh, do the skill
[12476.60s -> 12488.07s]  point. Take a look. This is what we have so far. We're at the bottom here. Give me a better
[12488.07s -> 12498.70s]  picture here in a second. Here we go. Take us somewhere. Take us somewhere. I'm going to
[12498.70s -> 12508.46s]  sneeze. So if you hate sneezing, I would, I would just leave the stream open. Walk away from your
[12508.46s -> 12526.54s]  computer. No, it's not going to happen. Ah, the worst. Torn. This might be a zoom in.
[12529.14s -> 12540.31s]  I think this is a zoom in. What does more revive do? More revives. So you can have two,
[12540.31s -> 12549.10s]  three, four, five, six. I think we have to zoom in. Sorry teeth. That's never going to happen.
[12549.98s -> 12596.12s]  Sorry teeth. Try again. Okay. Cancel crew. We're going to do a second point and revive. Thanks
[12596.12s -> 12620.17s]  for voting. Don't go anywhere yet. Oh, he needs mana. He needs vitality. He needs more strength.
[12621.37s -> 12650.90s]  Imagine helping the streamer. It's up to you. Vitality it is. This will get us a second revive.
[12651.86s -> 12659.98s]  By the way, in case anyone is curious, revive. It just, every point you put in just lets me have
[12659.98s -> 12670.41s]  more revives. That life and damage only comes from skeleton mastery and summon resist. So it pulls
[12670.41s -> 12679.26s]  from skeleton mastery. This does not do anything else, but it gives me more revives. I want to
[12679.26s -> 12686.28s]  make sure that's clear and whatever is yes, whatever is summoned, but let's get a,
[12687.24s -> 12702.54s]  we have a harpy. I'll take both of these guys. They don't explode.
[12704.92s -> 12720.73s]  He did. They both exploded. Great. These moonlords are really powerful. I'll take both of them.
[12725.29s -> 12746.49s]  Can't explode though. I don't need them to revive anybody. All right. The skeleton mages that are
[12746.49s -> 12759.10s]  freezing people. Could you hold off on doing that? My mana is such shit. If I revive one person,
[12759.98s -> 12771.72s]  I have to drink a potion after doing one spell. Where are you going moonlord? Get over here.
[12772.44s -> 12783.74s]  We're starting to get a very large amount of people. Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[12783.74s -> 12801.93s]  10, 11. There are 12 summons taking up lots of space. You have a whole community. It's just
[12801.93s -> 12810.68s]  going to get bigger. Especially with the revives. You can have like 20 revives, 12 skeletons,
[12810.92s -> 12813.80s]  eight skeletal mages. You can have a stupid amount of people.
[12815.16s -> 12839.77s]  These people have their own discord. Can I just say, they're all watching right now,
[12841.27s -> 12845.03s]  I didn't think that I was going to be playing Diablo two into act five.
[12848.15s -> 12852.10s]  I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this. I think this is really cool.
[12853.22s -> 12859.18s]  I thought I was going to make it to like act one. I didn't think I was going to go much
[12859.18s -> 12875.18s]  further than that. But here we are. I left a decent resist charm on the ground. It was like
[12875.18s -> 12888.12s]  five resist. I apologize. I forgot it. Will I be able to enjoy Diablo non-hardcore after this?
[12888.12s -> 12895.96s]  Yeah. Because as interesting as this is to do, I just like kind of running around and
[12895.96s -> 12902.31s]  dying doesn't matter. And I prefer a non-hardcore character for sure.
[12905.21s -> 12922.73s]  We need the crystalline frozen river for the frozen river. It's one of these places here.
[12941.74s -> 12945.85s]  How did the moon lord die already? That'd be possible.
[12946.89s -> 12969.06s]  The river is frozen because it's still a river. Yeah. There's the waypoint. Yeah, it is.
[12969.86s -> 12980.73s]  Because it's just, it's a river, a river. All right. Let's find this passage down here.
[12980.73s -> 12990.66s]  It really can only be this way. So it has to be over here and watch out for the champions.
[12991.46s -> 13029.94s]  I wish I could revive these guys. Surprise me with a unique, unique frozen river. Anya
[13029.94s -> 13032.58s]  is out here somewhere. There's also, I remember there's a champion here that can be a pain in
[13032.58s -> 13042.25s]  the ass. Oh, I'm going to be careful. These vomitables are a little boy. I'm going to stay
[13042.25s -> 13061.54s]  back here. I'm going to go over there. Revive. See that ship. My man is so bad. It's just a brawl.
[13062.18s -> 13086.70s]  I don't even know who's winning. I hope it's us. Burrito turns into pure carbon. It's still a burrito.
[13087.66s -> 13098.55s]  No, I don't think so.
[13106.09s -> 13112.79s]  No, it's carbon. Yeah, because if a river freezes, it's still water.
[13113.83s -> 13130.26s]  Burrito turns into carbon, then it's carbon. It's not still a burrito. Quantum burrito. The game was,
[13130.26s -> 13137.46s]  oh, by the way, I, I know the story now. I know I, I knew it already, but I, I know, I know the whole
[13137.46s -> 13144.87s]  story. I was kind of on the right track. The shit I was saying to you guys was a joke. I didn't
[13144.95s -> 13155.94s]  really believe that. Um, but yeah, that's pretty cool. That's a pretty cool story.
[13156.74s -> 13165.66s]  That's a pretty cool story. Story of the quantum burrito. No, the story of the story of
[13165.66s -> 13184.22s]  Outer Wilds. Playing like I'm five, the Outer Wilds. No, I've read a couple of timelines.
[13185.03s -> 13191.99s]  There were some good timelines to really piece the whole thing together. Like a whole chronological
[13191.99s -> 13198.10s]  events. Easy to see that way. And I don't want to talk about anything about it because
[13198.10s -> 13202.02s]  people probably hear them might not have played it, but it's pretty good. It's pretty good.
[13203.14s -> 13226.04s]  Reenus synopsis? Yeah, kind of. Isn't that what you do? All right. Anya, where are you?
[13226.60s -> 13247.22s]  Usually right in the middle, right? Oh, that wasn't smart. It's still alive. I have way too
[13247.22s -> 13267.35s]  many healing potions. It's just like, just throw them away. I love that sound. That paladin
[13267.35s -> 13289.27s]  charge sound. It's got a good ring to it. All right, Anya, come on. What the hell? Not down here.
[13290.87s -> 13302.54s]  Pain in the ass. Fine. Outer Wilds is supposed to come to Steam this year.
[13308.17s -> 13327.37s]  Well, sooner the better. Don't get overwhelmed. A little too late. Yeah, they did kind of release
[13327.37s -> 13332.17s]  that game on Epic Games Store right when Epic Games Store was kind of becoming that
[13332.17s -> 13336.97s]  exclusivity thing, right? How long? When did it come out? Like six months ago? Seven months ago?
[13338.09s -> 13350.63s]  Is it on the Windows Store? I don't know. I don't know very many people that use the Windows Store.
[13351.51s -> 13368.23s]  It was early last year. Yeah. Games for Windows. Pog. Or what? All right. Hey,
[13369.11s -> 13377.58s]  what's the anti-pog? What is anti-pog? Is there one? I feel like the market could be super,
[13378.46s -> 13385.99s]  what's anti-pog? Resident, but no, I don't know. Resident Sleeper is like, I'm like,
[13385.99s -> 13393.72s]  this is boring. I'm falling asleep. Anti-pog would be like, what you did was not as cool
[13393.72s -> 13402.49s]  as you thought it was. Like you did something that was supposed to be exciting, but it wasn't.
[13402.97s -> 13421.05s]  Ha ha. Yeah, but I guess.
[13431.02s -> 13450.78s]  Balefish? Yeah, never mind. Balefish fills that completely. Not like this. Yeah. Yeah, they're
[13450.78s -> 13467.45s]  there. They're there. Have I played Temtem? No, I have not played Temtem. I probably will not
[13467.45s -> 13473.32s]  play Temtem. I probably will avoid Temtem. I don't have a plan to play it. Not, well,
[13473.32s -> 13482.70s]  avoid was probably the wrong word to use. I'm going to use a better one. I'm not into collecting
[13482.70s -> 13501.30s]  and fighting monsters unless they come from a seedy stone. Pretty much it. I think we're close.
[13511.62s -> 13545.77s]  Can we get a price check on Chibi Robo, please? 200. It's 200. Still, it's 200. Wait, you can
[13545.77s -> 13563.43s]  buy it on the GameStop website? Remember when Jerma used to play TF2? Pepe Hands.
[13564.92s -> 13595.93s]  Oh, no. I played it every single day. What are you talking about? TF2 waiting room. Well,
[13597.13s -> 13600.89s]  you're going to be waiting. They're there. Your appointment's not for a very long time. You'll
[13600.89s -> 13608.44s]  be waiting a very long time. I think you should probably bring some snacks and maybe a few dinners
[13608.44s -> 13619.16s]  to that waiting room. Not only dinners, like rations. And when by waiting room,
[13619.16s -> 13637.11s]  I hope you mean bunker because you're going to be there for a while. So many potions, but no
[13637.83s -> 13658.66s]  mana potions. No, I have no plan to play it on stream or anything. It's a great game. One of the
[13658.66s -> 13675.93s]  best. Do I enjoy variety too much to play what play that message, but I think it's got the gist
[13675.93s -> 13681.93s]  of it. Do I like variety too much to stick with something, pick something that I played or liked
[13681.93s -> 13690.47s]  or stay with one game? I'm not even sure it's about variety as much as it's I can't stay with
[13690.47s -> 13697.59s]  the same thing. Like I just, for example, I'm not playing Diablo two right now to like make sure my
[13697.59s -> 13706.14s]  stream has variety. This is just what I want to do. Everything you see, I mean, sure there's a lot
[13706.14s -> 13712.78s]  of recommendations on the channel and you do a lot of them, but it's not, this is not like variety
[13712.78s -> 13718.38s]  for the sake of me doing, oh, I'm going to do variety for the channel. My brain needs to be
[13719.10s -> 13730.01s]  constantly stimulated and I get bored really easily. So that's why it was a shock that I was
[13730.01s -> 13735.37s]  able to really stay with TF2 for that long. That just speaks to how good that game actually is.
[13736.17s -> 13744.73s]  Are we boring you? No, I'm talking about video games, not like talking to people.
[13748.62s -> 13764.31s]  We're getting kind of creamed here. I need mana. Where are you going? That guy just
[13764.31s -> 13772.12s]  fucked off somewhere. Hey, get back here. You're supposed to be helping this frozen Stein.
[13772.12s -> 13785.11s]  This is going to get bad. Kill frozen Stein first. Oh, the thing I wasn't standing there.
[13791.53s -> 13796.25s]  This mission is really awesome. You get a very, very special,
[13798.31s -> 13810.79s]  you get a very special item for doing this. And.
[13819.72s -> 13822.92s]  Son. That bastard.
[13825.80s -> 13838.36s]  Do I ever get a desire to go back to TF2? Um, not, not in the way that you think.
[13839.00s -> 13846.10s]  Not in the way that you think. I do miss Team Fortress 2 because a lot of people have tried
[13846.10s -> 13852.84s]  to do this too and I think have not done it as well or have failed trying. It's very specific.
[13853.64s -> 13861.02s]  It's making your characters in your game, the character classes, the people that you play as,
[13862.92s -> 13870.09s]  such interesting personality types and such truly engaging characters
[13870.81s -> 13875.38s]  that you want to play as them and you want to hear more of their stories.
[13876.26s -> 13882.86s]  People have tried to do, like, remember those shorts? I remember when the only ones that were
[13882.86s -> 13889.18s]  out were, there were three of them. And when Meet the Medic was in development for like
[13889.18s -> 13896.73s]  four years, Meet the Medic was supposed to come out in like 2009 or something. It was
[13896.73s -> 13903.40s]  a huge fucking deal when it came out. I think a lot of game companies have tried to do that
[13904.90s -> 13914.95s]  and it's just not as interesting. Like the character, the demo man character
[13915.99s -> 13923.51s]  was fucking awesome. The spy was awesome. They all had these insanely different personalities.
[13923.51s -> 13932.79s]  I mean, they're all crazy, but in different ways. I don't think there'll ever be another TF2 demo
[13932.79s -> 13938.52s]  man. I really don't. I don't think that people will try, but I don't know if it'll ever happen.
[13938.52s -> 13946.23s]  The heavy, the heavy weapons guy, just think of that. Oh, by the way, big deal. Big deal.
[13949.14s -> 13960.25s]  Oh no, not yet. Toilet. Heavy weapons guys, just characterization wise, voice acting wise,
[13960.97s -> 13972.31s]  they all had these crazy personalities. We forgot about the princess. And the thing about
[13972.31s -> 13980.04s]  the TF2 voices guys and the actors that play them, they're not big famous names in the industry.
[13981.24s -> 13986.84s]  The guy that's the demo man and the heavy weapons guy is not some heavyweight in the voice acting
[13986.84s -> 13999.48s]  world. The medic is really the only one that has an actor that was at the times. I mean,
[13999.48s -> 14004.52s]  still Robin Atkins Downs at the time in like 2007, that was a long time ago.
[14007.90s -> 14015.08s]  Thank you so much for bringing Anya back to us. This spell to increase your resistances
[14015.08s -> 14021.14s]  as a token of my thanks. It isn't much, but I hope you find it helpful.
[14021.14s -> 14029.58s]  Nathan was streaming a little while ago. Yeah, he, he streams and he's, he's around. The
[14029.58s -> 14035.27s]  characterization that he gave to that scout. I mean, when you first played as the scout,
[14035.91s -> 14045.91s]  it was just like, this guy, I love this. This is awesome. We've actually streamed together before.
[14046.95s -> 14050.55s]  Some of you guys that might, the last couple of years or the last year or two, you may not have
[14050.55s -> 14056.31s]  watched the streams, but he's been on stream like three or four times. We played Dark Souls
[14056.31s -> 14065.24s]  together one time. Yeah, we played Dark Souls three. I get permanent resistance for taking this.
[14065.88s -> 14080.54s]  Take a look. Pretty awesome. It's always there. Permanent. Let's talk to Anya. Remember when
[14080.54s -> 14095.90s]  Jeremy used to play Dark Souls? Well, remember the future where I play Elden Ring and like
[14095.90s -> 14101.30s]  collaboration streams. You should collab, you should collab. Yeah, we've talked about
[14101.30s -> 14105.70s]  collabs before. We've talked about streaming with other streamers and stuff before. It's,
[14105.70s -> 14112.57s]  I don't really do it. Very rarely is there a multiplayer stream here. It's just kind of,
[14112.57s -> 14117.13s]  I just kind of do my own thing. Organically, something might come along where it's like,
[14117.13s -> 14135.43s]  yeah, that sounds like fun. Let's do that. Bomb streams with Joel were great. Yeah,
[14135.43s -> 14143.61s]  they were a lot of fun. Nelufak has escaped to his temple where he's being a real piece of shit.
[14144.65s -> 14152.63s]  I mean, I talked, I talked to a lot of people and stuff, but I have that sort of philosophy,
[14152.63s -> 14163.37s]  that sort of philosophy of, hold on, this is actually kind of good. Ray's Skeletal Mage.
[14164.89s -> 14170.49s]  Can I finally just get rid of this fucking thing? This thing is bad. Two to Ray's Skeleton.
[14173.16s -> 14177.16s]  38, 20. Look at how bad this is. It's just because it has the two in Ray's Skeleton.
[14177.80s -> 14195.30s]  A part of the reasons why I do mostly solo stuff is because I talk a lot. I'm like, oh,
[14195.30s -> 14198.66s]  it's like, oh, look at me. I got to say this and I got to say this and I got to say, and I,
[14198.66s -> 14204.44s]  anytime there's like more than two, three, four people in a stream call or something, it's always
[14204.44s -> 14209.40s]  like, especially when you get to be about three, four plus kind of people, it's almost like you
[14209.40s -> 14216.49s]  take turns talking and you don't want to talk over somebody and somebody has something to say,
[14216.49s -> 14218.57s]  but then you don't, you have something to say, but you don't want to talk over them. And
[14219.53s -> 14222.57s]  it almost becomes like, cause, and especially if everybody's streaming at the same time,
[14222.57s -> 14226.17s]  if you have like three streamers who are all streaming at the same time, they all want to
[14226.17s -> 14230.73s]  talk. They all want to talk to their audience and engage with people and talk and try to make it
[14230.73s -> 14236.36s]  fun. And you want to, you almost become like, it's my turn to entertain my audience. No, now
[14236.36s -> 14239.48s]  it's my turn to entertain my audience. No, it's my turn to entertain my audience. It's like,
[14239.48s -> 14251.82s]  you're going a weird circle. And then when people start muting each other and muting themselves and
[14252.46s -> 14256.74s]  somebody like is talking to their chat and then it's like, Hey, you still here? Yep. I'm here.
[14256.74s -> 14266.38s]  What? Yep. And the sounds of other people talking, let's say, let's say I am mute,
[14266.94s -> 14270.22s]  I mute the stream, you know, it's just something I don't really like to do.
[14271.02s -> 14279.90s]  I love playing multiple, when it works, it works. Right. And some people love
[14280.78s -> 14284.86s]  doing content in groups and it works very, very well for them. There's like, there are at least
[14284.86s -> 14289.82s]  three or four streaming groups that stream together almost every time on this site.
[14290.79s -> 14294.39s]  And they do a great fucking job and they really connect together and they work together perfectly.
[14298.84s -> 14314.20s]  I, I kind of just like doing me, you know, I'm just me here. And that's not to say this is
[14314.20s -> 14319.27s]  the right or wrong way to do that. But, you know, you, you do the things that you know,
[14319.27s -> 14327.94s]  that you'd like to do. That's pretty much it. I can't remove this because it has two
[14327.94s -> 14344.97s]  to raise skeleton in it. I can't let this be, I can't hold this over my own head. It's only one
[14344.97s -> 14349.80s]  point. If we're losing, how many points, what would we lose? One skeleton. All right. The
[14349.80s -> 14360.68s]  skeletons suck anyways. They're dying. One to confuse, one to raise. We lose one point.
[14360.68s -> 14366.97s]  That's going on. Look at how much other stuff we get. Fire block,
[14369.29s -> 14376.79s]  mana, lightning resist. And I actually get to have poison dagger. Hey Jarvis, this is Diablo. Please
[14376.79s -> 14382.79s]  stop cheating at my game. You think the tricks or glitches are so cool, but you're going to ruin the
[14382.79s -> 14387.59s]  immersion game that I make for you. You think duping is cool. You think cheating is cool.
[14387.59s -> 14395.70s]  If not, it's not. Please stop. I'm crying. That comment just get removed. I think it just got
[14395.70s -> 14406.97s]  purged. I got to get rid of some of this stuff. What time is it? I'm going to check the time.
[14407.61s -> 14421.83s]  Okay. I still got a little bit. Still got a little bit of time. Rip that dev. Okay. Ort.
[14422.63s -> 14439.82s]  This is Tao. Oh, how many spells do I have? Can I make anything? Yes, I can. I can make this.
[14440.70s -> 14448.30s]  Diamonds like not very good. I never was a fan of the diamonds in this game.
[14449.10s -> 14467.98s]  Is all res- no, all resist eight is better. I have to sell the rest of this shit. Okay.
[14468.70s -> 14490.76s]  Still have this lightning resist jewel. I have nowhere to put it. Oh, what's my favorite PS2 game?
[14491.85s -> 14513.13s]  Sure thing. Uh, the bouncer that looks clean. You're good to go now. Okay. No, no, no. I got
[14513.13s -> 14529.58s]  to go back in. I got to go to, uh, Alice. You were about to see the thing that Blizzard had to patch
[14529.58s -> 14535.61s]  because it was so easy to farm. Did you see where I just went in? Right? See this guy right here?
[14536.25s -> 14545.70s]  Endel skin. You could just pour it in here and okay. This is like a thousand people. Hold on.
[14557.53s -> 14563.45s]  They, uh, nerfed his loot table because it was too easy just to come in here and just
[14563.45s -> 14584.34s]  kill him instantly and leave. And he dropped really, really good shit. Stop hitting me.
[14584.34s -> 14591.94s]  Damn. Killed him. I would laugh my ass off if he dropped like a Zod rune right now.
[14592.66s -> 14616.30s]  I would. I would, I would laugh my ass off. Where is he? Endel skin.
[14618.50s -> 14625.86s]  Is he already dead? I think he's already dead. These guys come back to life. Did I- wait, did
[14625.86s -> 14648.90s]  he come out? Yeah, he's dead. Uh, we're going to level up though. Take a look. At this point,
[14648.90s -> 14663.14s]  do I even give you guys choice? All right. Make sure if when you click, yes, yes, yes. Uh-huh.
[14663.14s -> 14667.86s]  I will. All right. Make sure when you click, if you're clicking down here,
[14668.50s -> 14676.82s]  if you want fire golem, make sure you click like over here. If you want revive, make sure you're
[14676.82s -> 14682.79s]  clicking like here so the bubbles can spread out. We don't have to zoom in. If you want teeth,
[14683.35s -> 14687.99s]  well, then you're just out of your mind and you're deliberately trying to ruin my video
[14687.99s -> 14731.66s]  game playthrough and I don't appreciate it. Okay. I'm going to let this play out for a little bit
[14731.66s -> 14739.74s]  because it's okay. So I have to, I have to ask for help here. There are 4,500 people watching
[14739.74s -> 14749.40s]  right now and there are 560 votes. For the love of God, please, some of you, fix this.
[14759.46s -> 14772.38s]  But third point is just throwing it in the trash. He's influencing. Well, I directly asked.
[14778.07s -> 14787.48s]  I don't know where the bubbles are going to separate here. It looks like a majority want
[14787.48s -> 14819.88s]  to go down there. 55, 55. That's 20, 20. Zoom in. I have to zoom in. Do it again.
[14828.66s -> 14864.36s]  I'm going to squish it. I have to like really squish this. Get it so you can see both. Okay.
[14869.06s -> 14902.41s]  Again, germamandering. Nobody clicked on the curse menu. If even one person had clicked,
[14902.73s -> 14914.82s]  on amplified damage, nobody clicked over there. I did. Oh, looks like we're doing another point
[14914.82s -> 14928.49s]  into fire golem. Oh, this game is so lame. Can't we have some fun? Whoa. Calling Diablo 2 lame.
[14930.33s -> 14939.59s]  What the heck? What the fuck? I'm upset about that comment. All right, let's go.
[14940.55s -> 14951.53s]  Fire golem. Another point. And pick these two. The dreamcast sucks. Laughing my ass off.
[14952.25s -> 14962.76s]  The dreamcast fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. That's one of my favorite moments ever on stream.
[14963.32s -> 14968.52s]  Hey guys, I'm showing you this cool dreamcast. Look at all these games. This one sucks. This
[14968.52s -> 14973.72s]  one's not very good. This one's really, really crusty and really not very like kind of bad game.
[14974.52s -> 14982.10s]  Somebody just random dude in chat. The dreamcast fucking sucks. L-M-A-L. In the middle of like one
[14982.10s -> 14992.46s]  of those kind of bad games that I was trying to show. Like that person may have never even seen
[14992.46s -> 14998.81s]  the dreamcast before. It's just like, dude, this console sucks. Like, no, it doesn't. I promise.
[14999.61s -> 15026.20s]  All right, vitality. Did I get like banned from single player? What the hell was that? Here's
[15026.20s -> 15038.60s]  what's going to happen. Fire golem. That's way more damage. That's a lot of damage. Did I get
[15038.60s -> 15042.76s]  timed out? You can't even, you can't get timed out in single player. You know, it'll probably
[15042.76s -> 15047.96s]  happen. I had game paused. When I clicked back into the window, it probably clicked right here
[15048.52s -> 15059.98s]  and just, it's all right. I wasn't that far. All right, we're going to, our guy is good. 124 mana.
[15060.62s -> 15069.51s]  What a joke. Speaking of which, I'm just going to fill my sack with mana. Just
[15069.51s -> 15088.22s]  to the brim. One spell requires a full potion, so that sucks. I need a better belt too. Look at all
[15088.22s -> 15096.10s]  this bad shit that I have on. Why is the cube in your inventory? Or extra space in my inventory?
[15096.10s -> 15102.34s]  I usually put the cube here, but people were not happy about that. So I'm doing the thing that
[15102.34s -> 15111.32s]  people were saying to try. Okay, let's go. Hey, we get to kill Pindleskin again.
[15112.04s -> 15124.14s]  The scent of death. How's the fire go? I'm doing better than last time.
[15125.02s -> 15136.86s]  It's got like an AOE effect. It's all right. Um, guys, we've got, we're getting close in.
[15137.50s -> 15158.06s]  I got some friends now. We're good. Oh, I heard the ding and I was like, no way. Oh, I only have
[15158.06s -> 15165.18s]  four skeletons, but I took up the fuck. That's right. I'm sitting there going, why can I get a
[15165.18s -> 15171.53s]  fifth skeleton? I was thinking about getting a fireman tattoo. Shale. That's a pretty rare one.
[15172.33s -> 15179.67s]  That's actually not, that's pretty good. This is not, this is rare. It's not super rare. It's like
[15179.67s -> 15192.07s]  second or third tier. That's pretty good. That's like a two, uh, tier two. That's pretty good. Nice.
[15192.63s -> 15210.57s]  I'm happy about that. Okay, let's move. Neelifax temple. What the fuck do I have this? Oh yeah,
[15210.57s -> 15227.59s]  cause I have a million potions. Oh, let's store these junk. So we're trying to go down all the
[15227.59s -> 15239.75s]  way to go fight Neelifax guy that imprisoned Anya in the ice. Get a bigger belt. Oh my God.
[15246.98s -> 15258.73s]  I would, but I mean the cold resistant, the defense is just, it's really good. It's really
[15258.73s -> 15265.16s]  good. I just realized my title doesn't make any sense anymore. I thought I was going to spend way
[15265.16s -> 15271.69s]  longer on Diablo. I beat Diablo in like 45 minutes. I thought it was going to be the whole stream.
[15271.69s -> 15277.00s]  Be trying desperately to get them to die. I'm like having them refill his health for like two
[15277.00s -> 15290.82s]  hours. Well, it's still the name of the game. Yeah, that's true. It is the name of the game.
[15290.82s -> 15310.07s]  You're right. All right. Don't go too far. These nightlords demons. I want both of them.
[15311.19s -> 15321.50s]  It's not over here. See if I can quickly find this. Then we have to go to Mount Ariat and that's when
[15321.50s -> 15328.57s]  the stream turns off. I don't think I'll be able to do it, but hey, I will try. I'll give it a solid
[15328.57s -> 15358.52s]  attempt. I'd say I'd be ready. The halls of want, halls of not, whatever it's called. What is it?
[15358.52s -> 15370.33s]  What am I looking for? Halls of something. All right guys. Dead. Leveled up. Let's see. Level
[15371.13s -> 15400.01s]  33. Good. Nice. Good job. Let's get the skeleton through back. Hi. Follow me.
[15400.57s -> 15412.97s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I forgot how big this place actually was. It's kind of huge.
[15413.61s -> 15432.87s]  New champions? No. Oh, am I getting cocky? Oh, I think I got cocky. All right. Okay. I'm okay.
[15434.97s -> 15457.46s]  Ooh, I just can run so fast. It's like almost a shame if I don't run. That champion. All right.
[15457.46s -> 15478.01s]  Pause here so we can rebuild the, uh, the team here. Okay. Let's keep going. I'm surprised I
[15478.01s -> 15499.21s]  haven't found it. I can just zoom around. I think it's up here and when it's, if I take a look.
[15502.71s -> 15511.77s]  Okay. This is a stupid idea. Really bad idea. No, I have potions. Nevermind. Pause it. Freeze it here.
[15516.78s -> 15525.70s]  Well, we're in trouble. I may have flown too close to the sun here. It's possible.
[15526.50s -> 15549.88s]  No, we're good. Am I talking about it? Fine. Yeah. Shit. I thought it was for sure it was
[15549.88s -> 15568.66s]  gonna be right here. Come on. Don't make me run all over the place. I just want to find the next
[15568.66s -> 15600.17s]  level. Yeah. I'm right. Show auto. I can't show auto. He's not here. Flying around looking for
[15600.73s -> 15610.74s]  the place to go down. I'm so glad I can run this fast. Um, maybe I should rethink my strategy
[15611.38s -> 15625.69s]  because that was pretty close. Damn. All right. Hold up here.
[15625.69s -> 15664.58s]  I need some revives. Holy shit. Angelic sickle. Three to eight. Oh, yippee. I wonder if it,
[15665.22s -> 15672.28s]  I think I have the angelic blood. Interrupt whatever your dog is doing and bring him here
[15672.28s -> 15690.02s]  for our entertainment, Jeremy. I'm not gonna do that. Jesus. I can't. There it is. All right.
[15690.02s -> 15724.63s]  Halls of Ayn. One more level. Hopefully I find it quick. Wait for me. Keep moving.
[15733.94s -> 15753.78s]  Stop. Lucky. Good. Finally. Took me long enough. Let's go kill Neelathak.
[15754.42s -> 15784.09s]  It's a lot of sapphire. That's pretty good. What if he's going to die? Yes. I love the love
[15784.09s -> 15805.43s]  that was that through. Oh, I forgot about this quest. For doing this, you get to name an item.
[15806.31s -> 15812.46s]  You get to take any item that you own. Okay. Here he is. Where is he?
[15813.10s -> 15822.22s]  It's like right here somewhere. There he is. Okay. They're all his minions. It's necromancer
[15822.22s -> 15857.06s]  versus necromancer. They're his summoned ogres. Just playing auto chess. Get in. He has corpse
[15857.06s -> 15870.28s]  explosion though. That can kill me in probably one hit. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not even
[15870.28s -> 15880.09s]  stepping over there. See? Holy fuck. He has a lot of corpses to work with. All right. He's just a
[15880.09s -> 15883.69s]  necromancer like me. Just go up there and punch him in the face. All right. Will you guys get
[15883.69s -> 15909.11s]  out of here? Stop. Fight this thing. Whoa. Kill him. All right. Let's go. Teleports are wrong.
[15910.31s -> 15925.77s]  All right. He ain't getting away now. We got this in the bag. Wait till something dies and then just
[15925.77s -> 15945.54s]  bring it back to life. He's... Come on, Vic. I know you're capable. What's happening to fireman?
[15948.60s -> 15981.42s]  Mike, get on him. Where'd he go? Get him. Get him. He's right here. Get over there, fireman. Come on.
[15986.42s -> 16015.29s]  Hill. Go get him. Just don't step on any landmines. I'll be all right. Um, there's no potions?
[16015.29s -> 16042.97s]  How are there no potions? He's gonna corpse explode dead. All right. Aye. You dick. He was an evil
[16042.97s -> 16086.15s]  man. Yes he was. I got these cool things. So now it's time to see if this stream is going to continue.
[16087.11s -> 16097.83s]  This is where we figure it out. Speaking of figuring it out. Do I have any angelic stuff?
[16097.83s -> 16107.62s]  No. So I... I just was gonna sneeze and it went into my body. That was... That sucked.
[16108.94s -> 16116.25s]  Ugh. I was like... It went backwards down into my... Into my stomach and shit. That was weird.
[16116.81s -> 16131.45s]  I was trying to. I don't have any angelic stuff, no. Sanders. Arctic. Not angelic.
[16132.33s -> 16144.65s]  Bands. Rathras. No. No. Just a little shitty normal one. Just a shitty normal one.
[16145.21s -> 16157.34s]  I do have a shield. That's good. So talk to Anya before you continue through the crystalline
[16157.34s -> 16168.26s]  passage past the glacial trail to proceed up to Mount Ariat. Is this the sword angelic? Wait.
[16170.34s -> 16189.98s]  No, no, no. Oh no. You guys confused me for a second. All right. Let's go.
[16190.78s -> 16200.62s]  Back to the glacial trail. Do I have the waypoint? I'm an idiot and didn't get it.
[16203.85s -> 16207.40s]  I bet he can't play with facecam on. Oh yeah?
[16209.72s -> 16218.06s]  You're right. Travel through the ancients way to find the ancients at the Ariat summit.
[16222.39s -> 16234.10s]  I did not get... No, I did. Thank goodness. We went the glacial trail and then we need to go to
[16234.10s -> 16241.10s]  Mount Ariat. And I'll be in the process of probably saying my goodbyes.
[16242.06s -> 16252.70s]  It was a good run. I'm gonna try. It's a good run. You look like a cop. That's the first I've ever
[16252.70s -> 16271.59s]  heard that. Glacial trail. I think I've walked by it, didn't I? We are going to put this on players
[16271.59s -> 16276.74s]  one because the ancients are going to be the thing that's going to be nearly impossible for
[16276.74s -> 16294.12s]  me to do, I think. It is very necessary. Call me lame all you want. I'm still going... I'm going to
[16294.12s -> 16313.00s]  survive. Glacial trail. Is that not it? Speed walking. Holy fuck. Now, this is the crystal.
[16313.00s -> 16327.99s]  Where is this? Ariat plateau. Nope. We need the glacial trail. You guys good in there?
[16328.71s -> 16355.59s]  You guys all right? All right. Everybody's all right. Look, we're fine. It might get lucky.
[16355.59s -> 16380.25s]  It might just be right here. Oh my fuck. Okay, guys. Help. Friends. Skeletal mages keep just
[16380.25s -> 16410.25s]  dying instantly. Warhammer. Eh, okay. How we doing? We still have a full team, right?
[16414.90s -> 16437.10s]  Glacial trail. Glacial trail. Not over here. Aw, too bad. Where is it? Down lower left?
[16438.06s -> 16446.79s]  Wait, Ariat plateau leads to glacial trail. Does it? I thought it was crystalline to glacial.
[16446.79s -> 16461.26s]  Oh. Is that true? I don't remember. I remember it being crystalline to crystal.
[16461.98s -> 16471.11s]  Because here's the frozen. Frozen river. Maybe, yeah, you're right. Fuck. Ariat plateau. But
[16471.11s -> 16480.39s]  wasn't Ariat plateau behind the glacial trail and the waypoint? I always thought that was. Diablo
[16480.39s -> 16500.86s]  to poser. Not a real wink. I know a real wink when I see one and that's not a real one. Oh my god.
[16501.66s -> 16524.39s]  I can't just run through that. Oh my god. Where's Vic? I think he's just fighting down there by
[16524.39s -> 16531.74s]  himself. Oh my. Look at this. He's just getting. Alright, I have to go. That's not happening. I'm
[16531.74s -> 16559.83s]  gonna get my team to go in there. That's not happening. Okay. There's that. Let's get fire
[16559.83s -> 16574.97s]  back and let's get mages and then go back in. Follow me. 15k away from a wink here?
[16575.61s -> 16606.95s]  Well, use those points wisely. Use them very wisely. Here we go. One, two, three, in. Can
[16606.95s -> 16627.37s]  you wink anything other than your eye? Okay. I don't. How did I read that? I don't know. I
[16627.37s -> 16654.63s]  didn't understand until after reading it. Whoa. They were just sitting here. Sestus. Alright.
[16655.56s -> 16662.17s]  Ancient's Way. Look at the glacial trail. I think I know where it is. I think it's on this side.
[16664.47s -> 16681.45s]  Wait. Is it up here? I feel like it's not up here. I really don't remember. I thought it
[16681.45s -> 16703.91s]  was glacial trail to. Hmm. Glacial trail is up top right. You mean like this way? Or you mean in
[16703.91s -> 16718.46s]  that in the. It's been a while. I don't remember. I think I can run fast. It's inside the frozen
[16718.46s -> 16723.85s]  cave there, right? Go to the ancient. Yeah. I'm trying to remember where to go.
[16724.49s -> 16728.79s]  I kind of forget. I've done this a million times, but I just don't really remember.
[16729.59s -> 16738.50s]  It's crystalline and then into glacial way, right? Crystalline to glacial and glacial to
[16739.22s -> 16758.09s]  the summit. No, it definitely is. Hold on. Yeah. I had it right the first time, didn't I? I
[16758.09s -> 16766.46s]  definitely had it right the first time. At least I thought I did. Yeah, I had it right. Alright.
[16766.46s -> 16785.24s]  Let's go. Slowly making our way to the ancients. I got the shoes. Might as well use them.
[16785.96s -> 16792.12s]  Although I want to level up one more time. So let's not run through this.
[16806.63s -> 16822.86s]  Saber. Don't die. I definitely will not die before the ancients. I do want to be level 30. I want
[16822.86s -> 16837.98s]  to be level 34 though. If you beat the ancients, you get three to five levels. So 30 pog. You get
[16838.22s -> 16856.38s]  three full levels or four full levels by doing the ancients. It's pretty pog. Look, I'm using
[16856.38s -> 16866.41s]  twitch speak. I'm using it correctly too. So at 34, this final point is really going to matter.
[16867.53s -> 16871.53s]  These final points, but we're going to potentially determine the end of this whole thing.
[16871.53s -> 16891.77s]  We can't even pog. What the fuck are we supposed to do? You can pog. It just doesn't show up. I like
[16891.77s -> 16909.37s]  reading it. I prefer to read it than to see it. I like pog. I like it. This pog champ exists,
[16909.37s -> 16918.44s]  but pog is you saying it. When you do pog champ, that's your face. That's your,
[16918.44s -> 16939.69s]  you're not saying anything. You're saying pog. A little different. Come on. Let me get to 34
[16939.69s -> 16948.49s]  before I go to the ancients. Come on. Come on. This is my face. This is not your face.
[16951.27s -> 16973.37s]  I know what your face looks like. Not that Dave. You guys remember when, um, I wanted to do that
[16973.37s -> 16984.41s]  joke where in the title of the stream, I titled the stream like Anthony Roberts, come to this stream
[16986.68s -> 16994.54s]  or like this street. I wanted to do that so bad. Dave Smith, we're waiting for you.
[16995.10s -> 17000.20s]  And imagine scrolling down that and being like, what the fuck is going on?
[17017.24s -> 17022.84s]  Oh, a unique name that it's not necessarily like gone or like Dave Smith or anything.
[17023.96s -> 17050.65s]  Omega Lol Dave. Why is the name Dave funny? Name. Probably should do it. Omega Lol Dave.
[17051.45s -> 17083.48s]  We're going. Uh huh. Drifter Cavern. No, that means it's on the other side. I really wonder
[17083.48s -> 17096.65s]  if I'm going to be able to do this. This is the last real roadblock before bail. That's not true.
[17097.61s -> 17100.57s]  List of the tormentor is the last roadblock.
[17118.14s -> 17153.40s]  There's a chest right there. I'll take it. I need revives. Good chest.
[17155.13s -> 17160.92s]  What? Ooh, I heard a skull. Why don't I hear a skull? Oh, it's down here.
[17160.92s -> 17187.98s]  Okay, don't worry. We will level up before I do the ancients. I just want to because
[17187.98s -> 17193.34s]  if you, when you go into the ancients, you get one shot. If you try to portal out,
[17193.34s -> 17205.83s]  the whole encounter resets. So you pick up, you put a portal. Although you otherwise have to run
[17205.83s -> 17215.66s]  the whole thing. Yeah. This is going to suck. It has to be down here. Remember, we'll literally
[17215.66s -> 17220.62s]  never say penis. He's too pure for this world. I've said that, like I've said that word. It's
[17220.62s -> 17249.74s]  anatomy. What? Who cares? Like guys, it's all right to say vagina. That's anatomy too, right?
[17249.74s -> 17282.39s]  Yeah. That's what doesn't matter. I don't get it. Wink already. You want to see where my gamer
[17282.39s -> 17292.04s]  face is? Like this is where I have to pay attention. Right there. Just pretend I'm on face cam.
[17293.00s -> 17307.13s]  Wait, where the hell is this? Wait, what the fuck? I need the ancients way. Wait, is it frozen
[17307.13s -> 17323.24s]  Tundra? Did I miss one? Is it frozen Tundra? Then to, I don't remember. Frozen Tundra?
[17324.36s -> 17334.62s]  And then ancients way. Yeah. Damn it. Yeah. Ancient's way. All right. Ancient's way. Let's
[17334.62s -> 17350.86s]  find it. I actually cannot just go through this. I might be able to just run to get it.
[17350.86s -> 17359.56s]  It's like right around here. Look at me. Look at how fast I am. No one will catch me. I have
[17359.56s -> 17382.15s]  65% increased speed. Good luck. Ain't nobody catching me. I could run a mile. Iron Man's
[17382.15s -> 17404.52s]  going to protect you. It's going to be all right. Although I have to be careful that I'm running a
[17404.52s -> 17424.31s]  stamina. I will not get hurt until, unless I have no stamina. Here we go. It should be right here.
[17430.01s -> 17433.77s]  Here it is right here. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do this right. Do this right.
[17433.77s -> 17451.29s]  Do this right. Do this smart. This is where I die. This is smart. Like anyone's going to click on
[17451.29s -> 17478.25s]  curses. Where do you want to go? You've had stretching. You've had 34 opportunities to
[17478.25s -> 17486.76s]  click a curse and you haven't done it once. So trying to get me killed. It's all right.
[17487.64s -> 17549.77s]  A little late for teeth, isn't it? Apparently not to, uh, 48% of everybody watching the channel
[17549.77s -> 17586.47s]  right now. It seems like the perfect time. Vitality. Four to six damage. Four teeth.
[17595.38s -> 17612.34s]  These potions. Okay, let's go get an army. Dude, that's like 24 damage.
[17614.44s -> 17628.89s]  That's pretty, it's pretty sick. That should be enough. Actually. Yeah, that should be okay.
[17628.89s -> 17652.54s]  As long as I have like five people, it should be all right. Okay. Where we at?
[17654.06s -> 17673.64s]  Where we at guys? We good? We're good. Kill these champions. They might drop good shit.
[17678.71s -> 17706.41s]  Come on here. I'm overburnt. Ancient's Way. We are the spirits of the Nephalem.
[17707.45s -> 17765.18s]  Cool. I'm gonna have to use it again. Amulet. Should I fill the whole Ancient's Way area with
[17765.18s -> 17777.74s]  trash and do iron golem again? Because you have to activate it. What if I just drop like a hundred
[17777.74s -> 17793.58s]  weapons on the ground? I think that's the only way this is doable. Unless, I mean, Vic might be able
[17793.58s -> 17817.37s]  to handle it. Vic actually probably can do it. As long as I keep him healed. Level up too. Good.
[17821.93s -> 17843.96s]  Ow. Big Vic energy. That's right. Who is killing fire golems so hard? Who is destroying them?
[17843.96s -> 17871.38s]  This is kind of ass kicked. Icy cellar. That's not correct. That means it's over here.
[17876.10s -> 17904.15s]  Harriet Summit. I forgot. That's, okay, let me explain something very quickly.
[17907.77s -> 17915.78s]  You put that there on, if you're not playing hardcore, because portals are not allowed here,
[17916.42s -> 17930.17s]  but you can come back through the portal and walk in again. I can do this, but if this has started,
[17930.89s -> 17954.41s]  I can't use it. You have to do it in one shot. Oh my god. I didn't get any waypoints.
[17955.21s -> 17965.58s]  I didn't get any waypoints. I'd have to run the whole thing. Fuck. How did that, that was just,
[17965.58s -> 17971.50s]  that, like, two unfortunate things in a row. I could leave and just come back. Why did I use,
[17971.50s -> 17979.02s]  I was just showing people, I don't know. I thought I had like a thousand. Okay. Um, I, I know,
[17983.67s -> 18019.27s]  salutations. It ain't gonna end like that. It's a big Vic energy. I mean, at the end of the day,
[18019.99s -> 18025.13s]  at the end of the day, I have to just go for it. And I'm, okay, let me ask a question.
[18026.55s -> 18033.42s]  Am I allowed to port out? Because if I use a portal, everything resets. Am I allowed to do that?
[18037.37s -> 18073.19s]  No. I'm seeing a lot of nos. Open the fucking door. We'll do a proper poll. You see, if I'm
[18073.19s -> 18088.02s]  allowed to portal out of the Ancients, you're supposed to do it in one go. Ancients way. Watch
[18088.02s -> 18137.26s]  that stamina. All right. I just have to get up there. Just get up there. Fucking god. These
[18137.26s -> 18144.47s]  skeletons are getting beat so badly. These skeletons aren't good anymore. They used to be good.
[18144.47s -> 18159.88s]  What happened to them? They used to be so good. They can't take any punches anymore. Oh shit.
[18160.60s -> 18172.58s]  All right. This is blocked off. Chad Barbarian Ancients versus the Virgin Bone Boys.
[18186.15s -> 18202.38s]  Not that way. It's the other side. Is it? Yep. Here it is. The summit. Let's hang out right here.
[18202.38s -> 18212.39s]  Put a portal. Let's go for it. Let's get a full team. I might, I might just be overthinking this.
[18212.39s -> 18218.41s]  We might be able to do this. We might just be able to do this with a full team. It's possible.
[18219.05s -> 18253.62s]  I'll give it a try. I want a full team and I want two moon, uh, moon lords. Okay. How many we got?
[18253.62s -> 18263.38s]  Four. We got everybody. We got two moon lords. We have two something. Let's go. Let's do it.
[18263.38s -> 18283.58s]  I'm ready. You ready? Let's go. First try. Oh no, it's Bugleberry.
[18284.14s -> 18337.85s]  Focus one. Focus one. Get a moon lord. Come on. He said E3 gameplay.
[18341.58s -> 18353.56s]  Kill this one. Somebody's dead. Who's dead? They're both dead. Oh, we did it. We definitely did it.
[18353.56s -> 18361.98s]  It's over. I just did it. How many level? What level am I? 34? 35. Oh, that was a bogus. I did it.
[18361.98s -> 18405.58s]  I was not even, but yeah, I was overthinking that. Kill Bale. Let's do it. No one's going to
[18405.58s -> 18417.74s]  click on curses. You know it. Respec skills before Bale. Please. I, I can't do that. That
[18417.74s -> 18425.74s]  defeats the whole purpose of these streams. Could I just go delete everything or you guys have picked
[18426.30s -> 18433.34s]  and do a real build and kill Bale? But no, this is hardcore. Chat picks every skill and stat.
[18433.90s -> 18459.69s]  Can I beat the game on hardcore? It's important. All right, it's revive. That's three revives.
[18460.65s -> 18475.86s]  Very cool. These might be one of the, this probably only give you probably about five,
[18475.86s -> 18487.86s]  four or five more levels left in the remainder of the whole game. Chat, get bone mastery you zoomers.
[18489.38s -> 18501.21s]  Thankfully vitality is still on the brains. That's good. Okay, let's go.
[18502.17s -> 18535.66s]  Three summons. Next one is four. The world stone keep. Bale. The gates of sesharon have been close
[18535.66s -> 18556.78s]  for Eon. You will not open them now. Come on Vic. I need you down here. Well, that was easy.
[18557.58s -> 18571.14s]  World stone keep level two. We need the, we need, very important, we need the waypoint. It's going
[18571.22s -> 18577.93s]  to be a normal enemy that kills you. No, it's not. I've gotten this far. This is what hours,
[18577.93s -> 18585.24s]  it's been five hours. This is, is this the third or fourth Diablo two hardcore stream? Third,
[18585.24s -> 18599.37s]  right? The fourth is the third. So in like 14 hours, 15, 16 hours of gameplay, you think that
[18599.37s -> 18608.50s]  at this point, a greater hell spawn is going to kill me. I mean, that's field play is awesome.
[18609.14s -> 18629.90s]  More summons. Three. Good. We need the waypoint. These guys do explode, so I can't see your
[18629.90s -> 18638.42s]  concern. You're going to get too full of yourself and you're going to get cornered.
[18640.20s -> 18648.01s]  I don't know if I will. I'd like to level up once or twice though before Bale, which the
[18648.01s -> 18663.56s]  throne room should. The throne room is a EXP heaven and we get to hear the laugh. The best part of all
[18663.56s -> 18684.57s]  of act five. I thought you were one of my friends. Get out of here. I thought that guy was on my team.
[18692.22s -> 18700.84s]  Need to do a potion run here in a minute. Hey, listen, it's a login screen.
[18718.66s -> 18722.49s]  Full team. I need a mage. I don't think there's anything over here.
[18730.97s -> 18745.50s]  Bastard sword. Nope. We angry. We want teeth. Your rage is going to consume you.
[18748.12s -> 18756.54s]  Waypoint or level three? Waypoint. All right. We are now good to go. The final waypoint of the game.
[18758.23s -> 18762.07s]  Very useful if I ever want to do this again and come back and kill Bale for any reason.
[18762.79s -> 18787.18s]  So it's down bottom right. Like this way. I'm scared of list of the tormentor.
[18789.74s -> 18808.87s]  Like kill Bale music. Why? Oh, it's kill Bale music. What do you want me to play?
[18809.43s -> 18820.55s]  Oh, here we go. All right. One more level and we're at the throne room. You want to
[18820.55s -> 18825.19s]  play like the theme song and hold on. You want me to play the kill Bale theme song and have me get
[18825.27s -> 18840.36s]  muted. The apex of this whole stream series. I don't think that's a good idea.
[18841.08s -> 18873.06s]  We're going to have Diablo music. Throne room. We've probably going to level up two or three
[18873.06s -> 18878.28s]  times in the throne room. At least once. It's not this way. So what the hell am I even doing down
[18878.28s -> 18889.93s]  here? Does Mike just vibrate or am I imagining it? It probably didn't. Why fucking not? Hey,
[18889.93s -> 18894.09s]  don't pay attention to run down a hallway. What am I thinking? What are you doing?
[18894.89s -> 18932.92s]  There it is. I can see it. Ball hacks. We just need a good portal and we need to pray.
[18948.89s -> 18958.09s]  Throne of destruction. Kill Bale's minions and then kill Bale.
[18958.89s -> 18978.58s]  This is going to be fun. Win or lose. No matter. Win or lose. We made it.
[18980.02s -> 18986.89s]  10 community subs from FurtBernandes. Thank you Bert or Furt. FurtBernandes. Thanks a lot Bert.
[18987.53s -> 19008.15s]  Appreciate the subs. Thanks for the 10. All right. I need potions for this. Good potions.
[19008.15s -> 19033.30s]  Not these shitty ones. Okay. This part is uh you fight waves of enemies.
[19034.18s -> 19043.88s]  Just clear it out first. It's kind of a pain in the ass. Adventures of flying Jack like Kevin
[19043.88s -> 19055.66s]  McCloud. Let's do it. You're going to see him. He's scary looking. I have to warn you. He's
[19055.66s -> 19083.14s]  scary looking. Open my eyes. All right. I'll tell you when to open your eyes so you won't see the
[19083.14s -> 19104.33s]  scary monster. Open him now. All right. Everybody get in there. He spawns people right here. Hit it.
[19106.04s -> 19129.94s]  This is the exp heaven. Although there's only one person in the game. Me. We're good. I feel much
[19129.94s -> 19152.78s]  stronger. Good. Are you outpacing me? Am I being outleveled by my apprentice? Boys it sucks. That
[19152.78s -> 19204.66s]  was act two. Here comes act three. Counsel. Hey. Why don't we go out the back door and make some new
[19204.66s -> 19240.46s]  friends? Okay. A couple of mages. Let's go. Hey. We have a full team of friends. Remember somebody
[19240.46s -> 19254.42s]  said that fireman was bad. Um, what are they? What are they? Nuts? Back into it. Focus one.
[19258.58s -> 19262.42s]  Revive a council member. No, don't blow them up. They've made it ice. Oh God.
[19262.42s -> 19285.59s]  There's nobody to revive. How? Revive a council member. Finally. Here comes act four. I don't have
[19286.15s -> 19319.11s]  the skeletons are worthless, but they take, they take one hit of damage each. That means that seven
[19320.12s -> 19325.32s]  swings that I don't have to see or the other actually good companions don't have to see.
[19326.52s -> 19355.27s]  Okay. Let's go. I need mana. All right. See if I can get through act. So fucking dead.
[19357.32s -> 19368.17s]  Hey, at least you got to see veil. Have a good night. Everybody still have a council member. So
[19373.75s -> 19382.20s]  one, two, three. All right. Everybody's stuff in the middle. Get the council member in there.
[19382.20s -> 19403.75s]  He's the most, he's the strongest one. Get in there. Oh, kill somebody. I can revive someone.
[19416.82s -> 19447.27s]  Good. There we go. Look at these revives doing work. Okay. This is it. This is the last wave
[19447.27s -> 19470.30s]  and it's the worst one. I have three. Stay in there. Come on. Vic's dead. Vic's dead. I still
[19470.30s -> 19483.00s]  have my three, my three. Come on, kill one so I can bring one back to life. Anyone.
[19484.20s -> 19496.10s]  Nobody even has any health taken away. Get away from me. He tried your best. Um, he tried your
[19496.10s -> 19515.18s]  best. You couldn't hurt him. And now I'm going in there with no beefy minions. I said you
[19515.18s -> 19526.92s]  shouldn't be giving blizzard any, uh, was there any what? Any advertisement? Um, I've kind of
[19526.92s -> 19537.10s]  been talking shit about blizzard from five streams. I think, I think every time we've talked about
[19537.10s -> 19542.22s]  anything to do with blizzard, I've, I've made a comment about how bad of a company they are.
[19543.02s -> 19556.57s]  Blizzard north made this game. That's like a totally different company.
[19562.15s -> 19578.70s]  I'm not, I'm going to get fucking wrecked in here. Yeah. Go to river of flame. That's,
[19578.70s -> 19593.98s]  that's a good idea. I really want to kill this thing. Blizzard north. Yeah. That's a sad tale.
[19594.54s -> 19601.69s]  Blizzard north made Diablo and Diablo two. And then the entire company was liquidated
[19603.11s -> 19611.82s]  for some reason. Let me, do I have anything? Blizzard just got rid of blizzard north.
[19612.46s -> 19616.06s]  They were just like, yeah, we don't want blizzard north anymore. What is it going to get rid of them?
[19616.06s -> 19632.01s]  They used to be called condor before blizzard bought them. Yeah. And we got hell gate London.
[19634.76s -> 19640.14s]  Yeah. But what they were responsible for torchlight, weren't they? Wasn't one of them,
[19640.86s -> 19644.70s]  didn't one of them go on to one of the two or three people that made, uh,
[19645.34s -> 19654.95s]  Diablo go on to do torchlight. They just, the, the D it's like, we talked about this before.
[19654.95s -> 19660.81s]  It's like Chrono trigger. You had this perfect team and they all, from the artists, the designers
[19660.81s -> 19665.85s]  to the programmers, to the people making the engine, like that you had this group and they
[19665.85s -> 19670.41s]  all were really good. And then you split them all up and they all do their own version of the same
[19670.41s -> 19675.43s]  thing. And it's not as good as the, when you were all together doing the same thing together,
[19675.43s -> 19684.25s]  unfortunately. That's why we'll never get another Chrono trigger or a sequel because they're all
[19684.25s -> 19691.27s]  split up and they're all completely different companies in different places. So we will, you'll,
[19691.27s -> 19703.46s]  we will never get a true sequel to any of these games. Unfortunately. God, I hate video games.
[19703.46s -> 19710.81s]  That was funny. All right. I need to go to act four and revive. This is a fucking, this is a joke.
[19710.81s -> 19732.38s]  All right. Wait, I need Vic. I'm nothing without Vic. So let's revive a few people here. I think
[19732.38s -> 19743.21s]  I can actually go try to fight bail without fighting these things. See if I can get a couple
[19743.21s -> 19753.13s]  of this nights. I'm pretty sure I can just run into the gate. This nights are really good.
[19753.85s -> 19777.05s]  Oh, I got a bug. I'm on another wrist night. I'll take these three. Okay. One more this night and
[19777.05s -> 19784.60s]  I'll be good to go. Should be all right. And it didn't ogre. No, I want all ogres blowing them up.
[19785.32s -> 19812.15s]  Three ogres. Don't blow them up. I need him. My God. You fucking idiots. All right. Let's go.
[19812.79s -> 19830.86s]  I'm just going to, I got an ogre, an ogre. I have two bugs, two small bugs.
[19842.23s -> 19849.32s]  God damn it. Fuck it. Let's go. Who cares? Let's go. Whatever. I'm going in.
[19850.12s -> 19873.40s]  I'm going in. Wait, why was the portal in the middle? Why was the portal in the center
[19874.34s -> 19898.12s]  of everybody? Look at all the money I dropped. All right. Am I insane or wasn't the portal down
[19898.12s -> 19923.26s]  here? The portal was down here. When did it come up here? Oh, okay. Three. It was, wasn't it? Three
[19923.26s -> 19933.72s]  Winx redeemed. Check the VOD. You moved it. Did I? But why would I? Okay. I don't know. Would I have
[19933.72s -> 19939.72s]  been this dumb to put them? I wouldn't have put it like right in the middle. At least like,
[19940.68s -> 19948.76s]  that wouldn't have done that. You were rushing. It's because I got two maggots and I just wanted
[19948.76s -> 19967.16s]  to go in and ugh. Your deeds of valor will be remembered. You have died. Call me Lee Bones. Dead.
[19967.72s -> 19982.20s]  You cannot create or join with a dead hardcore character. That was a good run. All right. That
[19982.20s -> 19990.71s]  was, at least you got to see Vale. Take a pee break. We'll be right back. See what I'm going to do.
[19991.75s -> 19998.06s]  I, what time is it? No, actually I have to leave. Wait, it's been five and a half hours. Holy shit.
[19998.06s -> 20007.35s]  Okay. I have to go. Not immediately, but I have to leave like soonish. Uh, let's go pee. I'll be
[20007.35s -> 20019.13s]  right back. We will, we will settle. We can hang up for like another 45 minutes or so. Just about.
[20019.77s -> 20022.38s]  See what we can do in that time. I'll be right back. Let me just go pee.
[20057.67s -> 20151.19s]  Bro, I'm so late. Did he beat the huge red guy yet? I did actually. Uh, that's the last one.
[20151.19s -> 20158.86s]  I'm going in. My theory. Okay. Here's my theory with what happened right there.
[20159.74s -> 20163.58s]  I was going to try to pull them out because you don't have to kill them.
[20165.14s -> 20170.02s]  And I figured if I pull them out, I can get into the chamber where Bale was,
[20171.06s -> 20174.98s]  make a portal in the chamber, and then figure out what the hell I was going to do.
[20175.78s -> 20187.72s]  I guess, I guess I made a portal in the middle of everybody somehow. Did I like panic or something
[20187.72s -> 20197.16s]  halfway through that? I don't know. All right. Let's uh, Tommy Lee bones is level 35. He's gone.
[20197.72s -> 20205.32s]  That was a lot of fun though. I did not think I was going to get that far.
[20205.32s -> 20210.89s]  Not a chance in hell. It sounded like you were getting murdered in real life too.
[20215.53s -> 20223.30s]  Yeah. And I'm going to call it here. I might as well. Just because this stream was only going
[20223.30s -> 20232.31s]  to be about four to six hours because I have to go meet. I have to go meet friends. Some of you
[20232.31s -> 20237.27s]  guys don't know, but this is the stream where I have to say goodbye for a little while.
[20240.49s -> 20252.52s]  I will be back next week. It's probably on Friday afternoon. You will not see me for about six days.
[20253.56s -> 20259.30s]  I have a group of friends that are coming up from Boston. First time any of them have,
[20259.30s -> 20264.98s]  some of them at least have been out here. Um, first time anyone of any of them have come to visit
[20264.98s -> 20269.22s]  me in particular, except for one of them has come out once, but the most part, no.
[20269.22s -> 20279.88s]  So we're going to have some enjoyable friend time. So you will not see me again. They are here.
[20281.66s -> 20285.02s]  They knew I, you know, obviously that I wasn't going to be available till a little bit later,
[20285.82s -> 20293.75s]  but it is now later. So at 8 PM Pacific is when I need to essentially meet them.
[20293.75s -> 20307.03s]  I'm just snort cocaine. No, I do not do drugs. I do not do them. I thought we were your friends.
[20307.99s -> 20318.28s]  Yeah. But, uh, we'll do the bits. We'll hang out for a little bit. If you're taking off,
[20319.54s -> 20325.16s]  thanks for joining me these last five days. These streams have been very fun.
[20325.16s -> 20331.86s]  I've had a blast on all of them. For those of you Assura's Wrath fans that thought maybe today,
[20331.86s -> 20336.34s]  if we had time, we were going to do DLC, I was under the impression that if I didn't kill Diablo
[20336.98s -> 20340.58s]  and I just couldn't do it and I died within like two hours that we would have done it,
[20342.18s -> 20347.54s]  but there's still a lot of Xbox stuff to do. Assura's Wrath DLC will be tacked onto one of
[20347.54s -> 20360.66s]  the Xbox 360 games when we go back to it. When am I going to stream next? I'll be back on Friday.
[20362.25s -> 20376.63s]  So Friday the 7th is when I will return. Don't forget about me. Don't forget about me.
[20376.63s -> 20389.29s]  And that's going to call it tonight. Time to rewatch the Sorcery VODs. Oh, that was
[20389.29s -> 20395.22s]  some of my first streams. It was a lot of fun. As always, thanks for joining me, everybody. Let's
[20395.22s -> 20401.91s]  do the bits. Thanks for joining me. Again, a lot of people watched these Diablo 2 streams.
[20406.82s -> 20409.54s]  I'm happy about that. I'm happy that people are still interested.
[20413.11s -> 20418.33s]  This is like one of my favorite games ever. It's nice to share that with people.
[20424.82s -> 20435.61s]  Play Diablo 3? I'm not going to play Diablo 3 on stream. But thank you. I will see you all next
[20435.61s -> 20442.55s]  week. But Isaac, thanks for the 500 bits. Hey, Jeremy, I wanted to thank you again for the
[20442.55s -> 20448.62s]  laughs from last night's stream. I haven't laughed like that in a long time. Yeah. All right. Last
[20448.62s -> 20454.15s]  night's stream was very funny. When I got to the point where we were 10 hours in, 10 and a half
[20454.15s -> 20462.18s]  hours, and Iron Man did the royal flush and hit his face on the bar, I was gone. I literally was
[20462.18s -> 20471.05s]  in outer space. I was gone. It was just so stupid. I loved every second of it. Yeah. I had a lot of
[20471.05s -> 20479.50s]  fun. It's a great game. It's one of the best skating games. Glad you enjoyed it. Esquilo,
[20479.50s -> 20483.26s]  thanks for the 300 bits. Jeremy, I had a dream last night where you were my brother and I came
[20483.26s -> 20488.78s]  to visit you and Kim. It was an hour before TwitchCon and I was ready, except I had to pee.
[20489.50s -> 20493.34s]  When I got to the bathroom and zipped my pants to pee, you came in naked to take a shower.
[20494.06s -> 20499.66s]  I asked you what the fuck you were doing and why it was all see-through glass. You answered it was
[20499.66s -> 20510.09s]  Kim's idea of having a bathroom like this. And you had a massive, I had very large hands.
[20511.54s -> 20521.98s]  Weird. Thank you. Thank you for thanking people for their dreams. Hey, thanks. Thank you for your
[20521.98s -> 20529.61s]  dream. Thanks for the dream. Thanks for the 300 bits. Appreciate it. Don't eat macaroni and cheese
[20529.61s -> 20540.70s]  after 11 o'clock. Silent Serenity, thanks for 250. I once sold my soul to a guy on TF2 for a couple
[20540.70s -> 20554.81s]  of reclaimed. He emailed me a contract to sign and everything. Bulbaswag Desu, thanks for 500 bits.
[20554.81s -> 20560.17s]  I heard you looked hot today. Read about it in a Discord chat. I hope it's true, but I can't stay.
[20560.17s -> 20574.23s]  Have a good stream. Well, I don't know. You may never know if that was true or not.
[20579.51s -> 20587.40s]  50 community subs. Let's talk about it one more time. Zyxia dropped 50. Monster sub dropped
[20589.02s -> 20609.34s]  earlier. Thank you so much, Zyxia. Say it right. Say the name right. I always say people's names
[20609.34s -> 20626.95s]  wrong. I'm sorry. Say my name right. I can't. Hikikomoris Sunday. Zyxia, I can't do it. People
[20626.95s -> 20654.76s]  in chat keep calling me Morris. Wait, Hikikomoris Sunday. It's not Morris. Dude, people keep calling
[20654.76s -> 20665.53s]  me fucking Morris, man. Like, get it right. Sorry. But regardless, it was a shitload of subs. A ton.
[20666.57s -> 20673.14s]  No one's ever expected to even sub to this channel, let alone give 50 other subscriptions
[20673.22s -> 20687.77s]  to other people. Thank you. We had the shroom gave 370. Thank you, the shroom.
[20697.42s -> 20700.38s]  Oh, I thought you said now I'm developing. Now I'm getting deployed
[20701.18s -> 20704.62s]  to the Middle East. I'm just getting rid of the last few bits I have.
[20705.34s -> 20709.34s]  You all deserve so much more. I hope you see this message and understand all you've done for me and
[20709.34s -> 20716.10s]  countless others that have been here for so long. Even ones just starting to watch. I wish you the
[20716.10s -> 20729.59s]  best of luck. Take care of yourself. Thank you so much for being part of this community. If anybody
[20729.59s -> 20734.41s]  gets anything from these streams, I say it a lot, but it's true. If you get anything from it, good.
[20734.41s -> 20756.58s]  Very good. Very, very, very good. Take care of yourself. I wish you the best. I missed this.
[20758.18s -> 20762.98s]  I missed this message here. It was $50 earlier. I don't know. I must have been in the middle of
[20762.98s -> 20770.02s]  something weird. 5,000 bits from butt sniffing George. He said, Jeremy, I've been watching you
[20770.02s -> 20778.41s]  since you uploaded the TF2 video to Lepto1's channel in 2011 when I was 12. I want to say
[20778.41s -> 20789.50s]  thank you for all the content. I also wanted to embarrass you. Lepto1. We actually talked about
[20789.50s -> 20803.77s]  Lepto1 recently. Lepto1, I mean, to be completely honest, that was a pretty big reason why anybody
[20803.77s -> 20814.28s]  watched my channel when I had 200, 300 subs. I was getting maybe 500 to 1,000 views of video,
[20815.00s -> 20822.70s]  and he was getting 5,000 to 10,000 views of video. Maybe a little bit more, and it was like,
[20822.70s -> 20831.59s]  holy shit. That did a lot of good early on for the channel, which is the most important thing.
[20832.71s -> 20844.17s]  Going from one sub to 100 subs is way harder than going from 10,000 to 50,000. That initial
[20844.89s -> 20854.23s]  first thousand subs on YouTube is very, very hard to get, so it did a lot. It helped a lot.
[20857.30s -> 20875.43s]  No shit. All right, ban that guy. Hey, we got a wink. I wonder how long it's going to take
[20875.43s -> 20882.25s]  before I get really sick and tired of doing that. You know what I mean? At what point is this going
[20882.25s -> 20889.38s]  to be like, when am I going to not want to do this anymore? Like, oh, let me turn on my webcam
[20889.38s -> 20893.80s]  and wink into the camera. I wonder. I'm going to give it like 30 days and see how I feel.
[20900.62s -> 20909.82s]  But yeah, you linked my Combat Engineer Lakeside video from Lepto1's channel. I mean, it's not
[20909.82s -> 20918.70s]  really, it's not going to embarrass me. It's not because this is just like 10 years ago now.
[20918.70s -> 20935.59s]  This is almost a decade old, 10 years, a 10 year old video. Here's the link for it. I mean,
[20935.59s -> 20940.87s]  I don't really want to watch it because it's, I mean, it's 10 years old and we've watched 10
[20940.87s -> 20947.32s]  year old videos before and I'm just like, ugh, it's all right, it's good. It was okay. Another
[20947.32s -> 20958.38s]  wink? What is going on? I'm sorry, I'm already sick of doing it. How long? Took like two weeks?
[20958.94s -> 20975.88s]  It's staying though. It's not going anywhere. The worst part about this is somebody is always
[20975.88s -> 20981.69s]  going to be saving channel points for the wink. So if I ever get rid of the wink,
[20982.25s -> 20987.42s]  it's going to be really bad because somebody's going to be mad because like there's always
[20987.42s -> 21013.03s]  going to be a cycling saver for saving wink points. Anyways, thank you butt sniffing George.
[21013.67s -> 21026.70s]  Thanks for being around for a decade. Let us get the subs rolling. I'm going to bump you again.
[21026.70s -> 21030.82s]  I'm just, I'm just bumping you all day, huh? I just keep bumping you in the face.
[21031.54s -> 21040.34s]  Please don't stop the wink. I'm almost there. You almost add enough points.
[21040.34s -> 21057.19s]  How did I read that? What the fuck am I doing? Thanks all the subs. We had a lot of community
[21057.19s -> 21070.70s]  subs tonight. Appreciate it. All of you. The community subs from New Year's Eve have turned
[21070.70s -> 21079.53s]  over as you can imagine. But surprisingly enough, a ton of people that were gifted subs on that
[21079.53s -> 21098.49s]  night stayed. Thank you guys. Over 10k, not anymore. We, the channel sits at 80, 8,300 subs,
[21098.49s -> 21112.14s]  which is an absolute huge amount because you got to remember before, before New Year's Eve, it was
[21112.14s -> 21123.16s]  like 6,000. So New Year's Eve had thousands of community subs and for that many people after to
[21123.16s -> 21138.34s]  stay on. It's crazy. That's a huge retention rate for somebody staying subscribed. So I wanted to
[21138.34s -> 21141.54s]  give you an update on that because I know we've talked about a few times. Hey, we're almost at
[21141.54s -> 21148.50s]  like a, we're at like, we like, I've got 10,000 subs. I've got, I'm at 11,000 subs, but you know,
[21148.58s -> 21153.50s]  I want to make sure everyone's, I don't want you guys to think that I'm like, hey, we're almost
[21153.50s -> 21163.30s]  at 12,000. Pretty good, huh? Let's go, go, go. This was kind of an interesting piece of data.
[21163.30s -> 21175.69s]  I thought you guys might want to know. Numbers go up hyper. A thousand of your subs of mine,
[21175.69s -> 21184.34s]  give them back. I kind of can't, but no, seriously. Thanks guys. 5,000 subs was a huge milestone. I
[21184.34s -> 21192.09s]  didn't think that it would be more than that ever. And here we are. Thank you. Scam train.
[21192.09s -> 21200.34s]  Yeah, I don't have scam trains turned on. Hyper train, whatever. Potion dweller, thanks for the
[21200.34s -> 21205.98s]  250. Attention chat, save up your winks. I would like to have an ultimate wink where we all cash in
[21205.98s -> 21212.60s]  our winks one after the other in two months. Start saving your points. Let's organize and make him
[21212.60s -> 21222.70s]  wink endlessly. That would be such a, that would be such a bad stream. But if you spend your points
[21222.70s -> 21237.18s]  the way you want to spend them, if you want to spend your points, if you want to spend
[21238.06s -> 21252.30s]  your currency wherever you want, you absolutely can. Do blinks so it's two winks at once.
[21253.34s -> 21261.10s]  What do you mean, oh God. What are you talking about? I said you can use your currency for
[21261.10s -> 21273.96s]  whatever you want on, you can use your winks however. Why is everybody monkey-essing? Sorry
[21273.96s -> 21282.52s]  about that. Hey RTM, thanks for the 300 bits. Watching you play Thug yesterday, maybe remember
[21282.52s -> 21287.56s]  an old skating group me and my dad watched years ago. I ended up spending the night watching them
[21287.56s -> 21293.24s]  and some of the morning too. The group is called Fancy Lad Skateboards. When I went to look up what
[21293.24s -> 21297.56s]  they were doing now, I saw that they are now based in the Boston area. Small world, huh?
[21298.68s -> 21303.58s]  Anyways, here's a link to a member showing off some of their flatland tricks.
[21317.14s -> 21330.07s]  It says this guy's on bath salts, apparently. Hold on, let me turn this music off. It's not
[21330.07s -> 21338.28s]  like a joke video, just that's the title of the video. Matt Tomasello aka Rodney Mullen on bath
[21338.28s -> 21360.23s]  salts. This is just here. What the fuck? Okay, the cow... Jesus. The cow throwing the rock
[21360.79s -> 21367.77s]  at the crowd of people was saved here. That was when Murius was like throwing shit and breaking
[21367.77s -> 21380.50s]  stuff. All right, let's take a look. Oh, free tax, pay zero dollars to file. Pretty good trick.
[21381.64s -> 21401.26s]  Actually, this is on ice. Does it have no... There's no wheels. That board is broken in half.
[21403.18s -> 21425.59s]  What? Is this board broken or is that separated? Hold on. Is this guy a skateboarder or is he a
[21425.59s -> 21436.55s]  magician? Is this like a magic guy? These are magic tricks. He has two boards in one. He has
[21436.55s -> 21451.27s]  like a fake tear away board that turns into a real board, but all of a sudden he just does a royal
[21451.27s -> 21460.70s]  flush. What? How do you even do that? That's not even possible. Humans can't do that. Gravity
[21460.70s -> 21472.26s]  doesn't even work that way. I'll break it. Did a smaller skateboard come out of his skateboard?
[21473.06s -> 21520.94s]  What the fuck? That's so funny. Live birth. Yeah, awesome. Four heads. Nice. Nice. Oh, I could just
[21520.94s -> 21535.13s]  sit here and just eat potato chips and watch this for like the next four hours. Good commentary.
[21535.69s -> 21557.08s]  Guys, huge crunching sound. Sick. That was pretty good. Yeah, it's blowing my mind. Me and my dad
[21557.08s -> 21561.64s]  would blast through hours of these guys. I mean, this video has a million views, so it's not
[21561.64s -> 21572.68s]  surprising. It's really, really cool shit. It's surprising that people watch this stuff. Crunch joke
[21572.68s -> 21583.67s]  incoming. Link this one? Yeah, here. Wait, the original PogChamp right there is what that is.
[21584.47s -> 21593.82s]  Oh no, this video was uploaded in 2018. Never mind. Never mind. For some reason I thought this
[21593.82s -> 21602.54s]  video was from like 2005. I don't know why. That was awesome. Here, I'll link it here.
[21610.33s -> 21620.52s]  That's really cool shit. That was Matt Tomasello. Matt Tomasello. Thanks for sharing that though.
[21620.52s -> 21624.92s]  I'm probably gonna like watch those. Not tonight because I don't know. I'm not gonna have time
[21624.92s -> 21639.80s]  tonight, but music was really good. That was Artyom. Thank you, Artyom. Catboy Kubey. Thanks
[21639.80s -> 21643.64s]  for the 250. Jerma, I love the stream and I'm looking forward to that shower stream you promised
[21643.64s -> 21654.54s]  us. I don't remember doing that, but hey, Sinz. Thank you Sinz for the 300 bits. Hi, Jerma. Thank
[21654.54s -> 21660.86s]  you so much for all the kind things you said about my art during the last community content night
[21660.86s -> 21667.06s]  stream. I love to have your streams up while I work. Shout out to the lovely Discord community,
[21667.30s -> 21675.03s]  what is your favorite kind of fan art? I don't really have a favorite, but if I had to pick,
[21675.03s -> 21683.50s]  if you were like, pick now, go. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to influence any community
[21683.50s -> 21696.46s]  content. I like it all. I think it's all good stuff. I don't want to influence anybody's work.
[21697.42s -> 21708.15s]  I'd like to see what you come up with. There you go. But no, I love that shit. I'm glad that
[21708.15s -> 21714.95s]  that's something to do because before it was, I don't want to say the word sweeping it under the
[21714.95s -> 21722.44s]  rug, but images would come in and it would be right now the end of the stream. The stream's over.
[21723.75s -> 21729.19s]  Half the audience that was here for the stream has left and I just kind of open it and go,
[21729.19s -> 21735.26s]  oh, that's pretty, that's really good stuff. Good work. And then I close it. So having a place
[21735.98s -> 21740.71s]  where I can actually, that's the whole point. Everybody knows that's what's going to happen
[21740.71s -> 21745.94s]  and that's why they're all here. People are just, that's what we're doing today.
[21746.58s -> 21759.37s]  It's a much better idea. It's crazy how half the viewers leave and miss so much. Yeah, but
[21761.34s -> 21768.87s]  if you have, I mean, I'm not going to say you always stay, you have to stay and stay at the
[21768.87s -> 21774.79s]  post stream kind of chill discussion talk session. Some people want to watch the stream. They want to
[21774.79s -> 21779.11s]  see, oh, you're playing this or you're doing this and then you're done. All right. I'm leaving.
[21779.19s -> 21784.79s]  That's all right. Not for everybody. You know, you don't have to sit here and just watch a screen
[21784.79s -> 21789.70s]  like this and listen to me talk for like 30, 40 minutes while we go over messages and stuff.
[21789.70s -> 21794.84s]  That's fine. More than 3000, more than 3000 people still here. It's a lot of people just
[21794.84s -> 21801.10s]  are hanging out and just talking about nothing. Like I do a lot of times. I will just go off
[21801.10s -> 21807.30s]  and just start talking about anything or nothing during these things. And then of course we have
[21807.30s -> 21815.58s]  the people's donations and sub messages coming too. So it's all good. You don't, you don't have
[21815.58s -> 21822.36s]  to stay. You do, you do. And if you don't, you don't scream about nothing. Seinfeld,
[21826.15s -> 21829.91s]  swiggity swanky. Thanks to the two 50. I know you're a big guy on Twitch and very busy
[21829.91s -> 21833.99s]  because you are popular, but have you ever seen this clip of the, of the scout,
[21836.41s -> 21840.49s]  of, uh, what Nathan doing something? Would you and Jerma stream together again? I would. Absolutely.
[21841.45s -> 21845.83s]  Jerma is way bigger than me. So he's way hard to get away. Harder to get a hold of you guys.
[21845.83s -> 21850.31s]  I'm available. Jerma to get a hold of me and that you want to see a stream. I am happy to do it.
[21851.27s -> 21857.03s]  There you go. I think of a co-op is like,
[21858.44s -> 21867.30s]  got to find like the right co-op thing to do. Hey fellas, he's available. That clip is over a year
[21867.30s -> 21876.31s]  old. Oh, that hurt. That clip is a year old. He didn't wait. He didn't say this like last weekend.
[21879.51s -> 21889.03s]  This clip, wait, this clip didn't happen at like four o'clock today. I am available a year later.
[21889.03s -> 21899.51s]  He's been emailing you for years. Uh, no, I mean, if something comes up to do, uh,
[21899.51s -> 21908.97s]  I just need some co-op thing to do. Look, italics is right here over there and all the time we're
[21908.97s -> 21911.61s]  just like, you want to, we have everything we can, you have any co-op stuff we could do? And it's
[21911.61s -> 21929.42s]  just like, no, not really. SWAT4. They just think about SWAT4. Actually, I talked to Star today
[21929.42s -> 21936.20s]  about this. Star and I have been trying to play SWAT4 for five years. We actually talked about
[21936.20s -> 21946.73s]  it today that you can actually do it now. We have been trying to play this game somehow for five
[21946.73s -> 21962.25s]  years. Is there a stream that's been five years in the making? Uh, it wasn't going to be a stream.
[21962.33s -> 21967.96s]  It was going to be a video. Whether it was, uh, Star was going to be the one making it or I was,
[21969.10s -> 21984.74s]  we were going to make a video on SWAT4. Guys, this is like 2013 or 2014. First upload on the
[21984.74s -> 21992.20s]  main channel in three years now. I can't believe it. Hey, man, German, German Nathan. Oh yeah. Hey,
[21992.20s -> 22004.10s]  here's a clip. I thought this was from like a week ago or something, but co-op games are fun. But
[22004.10s -> 22007.70s]  like I said before, we already went over it, but we'll go over it one more time.
[22008.74s -> 22017.58s]  I just mainly do my own thing. Maybe like once every couple months there is a multiplayer kind
[22017.58s -> 22027.10s]  of co-op stream. Just kind of do my own thing. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to do them,
[22027.10s -> 22033.10s]  right? Me and Joel played, keep talking, nobody explodes, you know, and whatever,
[22033.10s -> 22036.94s]  whatever happens happens. We just keep going. Music is gone. We don't even need it right now.
[22036.94s -> 22050.68s]  I'm talking to you personally right now. Just once I want the rat to get the popcorn.
[22051.72s -> 22056.86s]  Not good for rats, but you're not supposed to eat it. It's supposed to eat berries and celery
[22057.42s -> 22070.71s]  or whatever rats eat. Yeah. I will use the same streamer blanket statement. Like I said before,
[22071.35s -> 22078.87s]  I love playing with people. I love streaming. For the most part, I do streams alone, unless of
[22078.87s -> 22081.99s]  course there's some big event going on where multiple people are going to be involved.
[22082.79s -> 22091.10s]  Eat an onion, eat an onion on stream. I don't think I can even eat a raw onion. It'd probably
[22091.10s -> 22100.39s]  be bad for me. That's very edgy, dude. Just me alone. Let's do my own thing. I'm alone loner.
[22105.02s -> 22108.46s]  Hey, gnarly. Thanks for the 250. I love these streams where you play a game you loved when
[22108.46s -> 22112.46s]  you were younger. They're still, they're very chill. Nice to watch you not suck at something.
[22113.10s -> 22117.82s]  Hope you do more in the future. Have a good week. Hey, thanks. Appreciate that.
[22122.17s -> 22126.57s]  Kiari, thanks for the 500 bits. A shame to see you lose right at the end, Jerma.
[22127.13s -> 22131.93s]  It was a good run. Just want to thank you. You help us all out so much by making us smile.
[22131.93s -> 22136.33s]  My grandfather passed away tonight and it helps having you stream around to ease pains like that.
[22137.13s -> 22144.65s]  Thank you for the great stream as always. I'm sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace.
[22145.21s -> 22157.96s]  Losing a family member is always very hard. I wish you the best. Thanks for hanging out.
[22158.52s -> 22170.46s]  Stick around. Stick around. What's the matter? What? You want to get out of here?
[22171.10s -> 22177.69s]  You want to get out of here? Yeah. I'm gonna get out. He wanted to come in. Now he wants to get out.
[22178.65s -> 22182.10s]  He's like, let me in. And he's like, let me out. He's like, let me in. He's like, let me out.
[22182.90s -> 22189.82s]  He must have. What? You want to leave now? He's like, just. All right. Hold on. One sec.
[22218.57s -> 22225.85s]  He wanted to go see Kim. He heard Kim. He's like, I want to be out there. Like, you're boring.
[22226.81s -> 22235.43s]  Let's go. But let's keep going. Freudian weapon. Thanks for the 500 bits. Enjoy your time off.
[22235.43s -> 22248.12s]  See you Friday. See you Friday. I will be back. We have a lot of stuff to play. I will return.
[22248.12s -> 22256.42s]  You will see me next week. You died to Bale. Well, I didn't die to Bale. I died to Bale's minions.
[22257.14s -> 22261.19s]  We didn't even get to see one move from Bale, but that's okay.
[22261.99s -> 22268.30s]  Further than I thought I was going to get. Merry GR. Thanks for the 250. Jerma, I had a
[22268.30s -> 22273.26s]  dream the other day where you were doing some Little Mermaid parody. Nothing really to the
[22273.26s -> 22279.42s]  dream, but I woke up crying in a weird fit of feeling the love from you and this whole
[22279.42s -> 22297.08s]  community. Thanks for all the joy. Feeling the love from you in this community and this community.
[22302.26s -> 22312.97s]  Why would I be doing a Little Mermaid parody? Do I have just like phantoms that just go around
[22313.53s -> 22319.53s]  at night and just cause mischief? Isn't this some folklore monster or creature or something that
[22319.53s -> 22331.18s]  does that? What is that called? It's called something. This is these little like phantom
[22331.18s -> 22343.13s]  goblins that mess with you and fuck with your dreams and stuff. What are they called? Your
[22343.13s -> 22349.21s]  sleep paralysis demon. Well, no, I don't think. Okay. If your sleep paralysis demon is a parody
[22349.21s -> 22356.02s]  of the Little Mermaid playing out in your room, that would be a very strange sleep paralysis
[22356.02s -> 22365.54s]  demon. It's just lying back on your bed, just not being able to move. It's just like
[22374.22s -> 22388.14s]  get me the fuck out of here. Peaceful Haley. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jeremy. Hope you have
[22388.14s -> 22392.26s]  fun with your friends this week. Thank you. I just want to say the other day during community
[22392.26s -> 22396.98s]  content night when you asked how I built your name in Minecraft, all he did was build up one
[22396.98s -> 22402.82s]  block at a time, made a bridge up top and just built the letters on that, then went back and
[22402.82s -> 22408.18s]  removed the bridge one block at a time. It took me a while and I wonder if there was an easy way
[22408.18s -> 22421.38s]  to have done that. That's pretty pog. That's 200 IQ, you know. Have a good night to you as well.
[22421.38s -> 22430.70s]  Thank you. That's coming back probably sometime in the middle of March, I would think. We'll see.
[22430.70s -> 22435.74s]  Still being worked on. Got something special for it. That's why. It's not just going to be what you
[22435.74s -> 22441.18s]  think it is. Whole of one zombie thanks to the 250. I've had two dreams that you were in.
[22441.98s -> 22447.80s]  The first, I was your security at some red carpet event. That's pretty cool. The other,
[22447.80s -> 22453.08s]  I met Italics Kim and yourself, had an awkward dinner. Italics was super friendly, but you were
[22453.08s -> 22465.24s]  not. Then you drove me to the airport. Why does everyone dream of you? I don't know. I don't know.
[22469.54s -> 22482.28s]  You're a dick. Why are you a dick in dreams? I don't know. That's not me. Quantum Jerma, yeah.
[22482.84s -> 22488.23s]  Nothing like that. Keith King Crimson thanks to the 250. What if that guy who kept spamming
[22488.23s -> 22492.87s]  Jerma just like backpack a few months ago could see the future? I was trying to talk about the
[22492.87s -> 22500.47s]  straps of your boomer harness. We, I haven't said that out loud in a long time. Was that actually
[22500.47s -> 22506.07s]  just somebody from this community just writing a sentence that made no sense or is that an actual
[22506.07s -> 22515.54s]  meme that somebody, it just was, I'm going to write a nonsense statement. It means nothing.
[22515.54s -> 22519.14s]  It's not a meme from anything. It's not a reference to anything. It's just somebody wrote that.
[22520.18s -> 22532.81s]  That was it. I'm here. It was just one guy. He did it for like three streams. Hey, look at that.
[22532.81s -> 22548.38s]  A wink. Could you believe it? People have been saving up. All right, we only have a few more
[22548.38s -> 22559.56s]  bits to do. He smiled at me. He smiled at me. A poop killer thanks to the 500 bits.
[22560.28s -> 22564.60s]  Freezy burns thanks to the 300 bits. Jerma gonna miss you for the next week. Always a pleasure
[22564.60s -> 22569.22s]  staying up late to watch your streams. Don't forget about me. Don't worry. I won't forget about
[22569.22s -> 22573.94s]  you guys. I hope you don't forget about me. Come back. It's going to be empty. It's going to be an
[22573.94s -> 22579.21s]  empty town here. I've been away for much longer than this. You guys are still here. So
[22580.01s -> 22588.63s]  we'll see you when I get back. X war two. Thanks for the 250. I forgot you. I forgot you had to
[22588.63s -> 22596.38s]  use at least 250 bits and that is a newish rule over the last probably six, seven months or so,
[22596.38s -> 22602.54s]  just about just about maybe a little bit longer than that. But still, it's still a fairly new
[22602.54s -> 22607.18s]  rule in the grand scheme of things. Just want to say that I'm sad I missed all the streams this week
[22608.14s -> 22613.74s]  but this new blood has been getting caught up on VODs. There's just too many old games you had
[22613.74s -> 22619.66s]  gone through almost caught up. Expect to see more of me in the future. This new blood's here to stay.
[22620.30s -> 22624.94s]  I've only been falling for two weeks. Just finished black and white. Hopefully you'll
[22624.94s -> 22631.02s]  play the sequel soon. Well, welcome. Welcome to the stream. Welcome to the channel.
[22633.96s -> 22643.91s]  If you want to really catch up totally, you've got seven and a half years of YouTube videos
[22643.91s -> 22650.63s]  and streams to watch. It'll take you, I mean it might take you maybe two or three straight months
[22650.63s -> 22655.83s]  every day, 24 hours straight to watch them all. Maybe like four months straight. You just got to
[22655.83s -> 22662.58s]  catch up. Skip season three. So I would skip season two. Season three was really good.
[22663.62s -> 22672.52s]  Start with the Shwee videos. This used to be a Maynay stream and that's an old one.
[22673.66s -> 22680.46s]  Now welcome. Thanks for joining. Thanks for following. Especially thanks for giving me money
[22680.46s -> 22688.52s]  because that's not necessary but people do all the fucking time. So thank you.
[22689.40s -> 22694.31s]  Jay Bum Bum. Jay Bum Bum 7723. You got to get it right.
[22697.54s -> 22700.90s]  Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey Jerma, you know when you're watching a horror movie and start
[22700.90s -> 22704.82s]  screaming at the screen because the protagonist is doing something dumb and you know exactly
[22704.82s -> 22709.70s]  what's going to happen. That's what watching the outer wild stream was like. Watching you try to
[22709.70s -> 22713.38s]  find the entrance to the vessel was like watching a fly in your house try to get out through the
[22713.38s -> 22719.30s]  window. All jokes aside, I love your streams and the outer wild streams was amazing. Keep up the
[22719.30s -> 22730.74s]  good work. Somebody wrote, that's called backseat gaming. Now that game was really fun. It was very
[22730.74s -> 22737.46s]  interesting too. It wasn't that bad. I, all right. I feel like I figured out a lot of the stuff in
[22737.46s -> 22743.88s]  that game. I, I was putting the, I took my time. I was trying to do stuff. I figured out the last
[22743.88s -> 22752.44s]  puzzle on my own. Right? I did okay. I didn't do fantastic. It did all right. Not the worst Tony
[22752.44s -> 22764.31s]  Hawk player that's ever by the way. I'm still on that. We're going to YouTube the end of the game.
[22764.31s -> 22769.11s]  Yeah, but we don't talk about that. That was, I was just, I was cranky. I didn't have my fucking
[22769.11s -> 22784.14s]  go-go applesauce. Sun joke got old. It's the new, it's the new bear trap thing from Darkwood. I can't
[22784.14s -> 22786.94s]  tell you it was fake because nobody would believe me anyways. It doesn't matter.
[22788.22s -> 22792.82s]  I can't like tell you that it was real because it was like, no, there's no way it was. Yeah,
[22792.82s -> 22801.69s]  whatever. And finally, silent serenity. Thanks for the 250. You should upload another update
[22801.69s -> 22806.65s]  video to the main channel just as a joke. No, that's just like, and that's just like,
[22807.45s -> 22821.10s]  it's like antagonizing somebody. I don't want to do that. Did you buy Super Frog 2? I don't even,
[22821.10s -> 22827.69s]  I didn't, no, I didn't. I'll have to get it. Somebody said, why, why does italics not want
[22827.69s -> 22831.77s]  to do co-op streams? No, no, that's not, that's not what I meant. I just said there's not a whole
[22831.77s -> 22838.33s]  lot of co-op games to play that we really want to do. There's really only like two.
[22839.67s -> 22844.38s]  Swat's one of them. We'll probably all just play it. I think it's like, you can have like up to
[22844.38s -> 22848.38s]  three or four players in one of those games, can't you? Try to get all the boys together.
[22855.75s -> 22863.51s]  Yeah, you can squat four, you can have like four players. The boys. Let's get the boys
[22863.51s -> 22874.34s]  to get, let's get the boys back. Hot Dog Chokeslam just gave 300 bits at the very end.
[22876.22s -> 22889.83s]  Uh, they don't say it, just Jerma Hart. Thank you Hot Dog Chokeslam. And that is it. I will see you
[22889.83s -> 22898.89s]  all in a week. I've got to get going. I have to meet up with friends. Have a wonderful rest
[22898.89s -> 22904.12s]  of your night. Have a wonderful week. See you guys soon. Much love to you. Take care of yourselves.
[22906.30s -> 22907.66s]  Good night.
