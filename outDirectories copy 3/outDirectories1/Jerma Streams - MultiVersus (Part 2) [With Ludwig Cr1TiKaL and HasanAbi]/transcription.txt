[3.58s -> 8.58s]  Alright, let me make sure the stuff for the sponsor segment is ready.
[8.58s -> 17.37s]  By the way, oh, I gotta think of a good title. What should I title this? What should I title this?
[17.37s -> 34.15s]  There are drops gonna be on, by the way. If you want to potentially get access to multiverses,
[34.15s -> 48.65s]  by the way, the open beta, I believe is the 26th, do an apology video for being wrong about Ant-Man.
[48.65s -> 57.02s]  I already said I'm sorry. I already apologized. Alright, let's go. I gotta change the title to
[57.02s -> 63.98s]  something. What? I gotta think of a good, give me a good grabbable title. Something that I can,
[63.98s -> 73.90s]  something that's gonna grab people. You know what I mean? Let me make sure that's there. Hey,
[73.90s -> 81.08s]  can you guys confirm that the images in the bottom of the stream? Yeah, there it is. Alright, cool.
[81.08s -> 94.06s]  It's there. This should be a chat bot too. I can't believe you rides bugs. I never, I can't believe
[94.06s -> 115.66s]  it. Alright, so I cannot wait. I didn't practice that much off stream, by the way, but I will do
[115.66s -> 130.39s]  my best. Title, what's a good title? Multiverses. Okay, give me one more second. Rating the best
[130.39s -> 135.35s]  bugs and being the best bugs bunny player later. Oh, that's not gonna work. Alright, how about,
[137.21s -> 141.77s]  I can put my camera back on so you guys don't all freak out. That's better. Okay, how about,
[147.50s -> 154.97s]  how about, let's go for it. What do I put here? I don't know what to do. What, what's a good,
[155.45s -> 177.61s]  I need to get a good title. How about bugs in it up? How about bugging out? No, bugs Andy. Alright,
[177.61s -> 188.07s]  how about, let's go with, what should I do for, I gotta think, I have to think of a good title
[188.81s -> 202.15s]  in the next 10 seconds. Okay, how about, we'll just do back in the multi, back in multiverses.
[205.59s -> 223.99s]  Let's go. That sucks. Back, back in multiverses, bugs Andy. No, back in multiverses. Bugs, bugs,
[223.99s -> 243.42s]  bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. That's good. How about I say drops enabled as well. That looks good. Alright,
[244.47s -> 251.43s]  let's fucking freaking go. Let's freaking go. Let's freaking go. Let's freaking go.
[256.42s -> 260.26s]  I don't think that's a problem. I don't think that's a problem.
[261.22s -> 275.24s]  Are you guys ready? Why's my face came so huge? Alright. Alright, I'm ready. Don't quit. We're
[275.24s -> 287.24s]  gonna do teams. I practiced a tiny bit. This is a sponsored stream by the way. Wait, what cross
[287.24s -> 294.60s]  platform? Yeah, that's fine. I'm so ready for this. But thank you. Thank you to Warner Brothers
[294.68s -> 301.11s]  Interactive. Seriously, sponsoring the stream. Drops are enabled. If you have drops on,
[301.99s -> 308.38s]  keep it on. If you watch for an hour, that's how you get access to the game.
[310.47s -> 320.70s]  By the skin? This is by the way, this is why I love this shit. Cross platform, cross progression,
[321.66s -> 328.90s]  PC, Xbox, PlayStation. You can play with each other. You can cross progression. It's fucking
[328.90s -> 338.44s]  awesome. Am I going? Oh, yeah. Let's go. Operation rabbit. Yeah, mods. Keep it on the bot.
[338.44s -> 348.14s]  There should be a chat bot. Yeah, I have drops enabled right now. Alright, me and Steven Universe
[348.14s -> 355.05s]  versus Shaggy and Garnet. I don't I think I'm level one. So all progression will carry over
[355.05s -> 368.71s]  by the way. Yes, it will. I don't think I think you guys are not. I think you guys are not ready
[368.71s -> 375.46s]  for how well I'm thinking I'm going to do here. Check it out. Oh, by the way, what's that? Oh,
[375.46s -> 386.87s]  excuse me. Bingo. That's right. Take a look at that. I thought it was the other character
[386.87s -> 418.38s]  for a second. I got to remember the controls and everything. All right. Keep it together. Keep
[418.38s -> 437.94s]  it together. We got it. We got it. Oh, it's gonna be a double. See you later. Come on. Come on,
[437.94s -> 468.41s]  Steve. Come on, Steve. I'm going under, going under, going under. Do it. Yeah, I see. What is
[468.41s -> 477.58s]  that? It's all good. We're good. We're good. We got the advantage. We're good. Nice job, Steve.
[478.30s -> 494.14s]  Damn, this might hurt. I'm all right. Sorry. I have to probably just peek the mic.
[496.82s -> 524.06s]  Multi-versus. Open beta on July 26th. Where are you? That was weird. Drop it.
[537.50s -> 548.92s]  See you. That's it, right? Trevor, you can't play video games.
[550.60s -> 561.29s]  Gee, you stinker. I got to tell you something. Let's go. I said this before. I'm going to say
[561.29s -> 574.18s]  it again. The net code in this game is unbelievable. It feels fantastic to play this game. You heard me
[574.18s -> 586.44s]  say this already. Everything feels one to one. One to one. A lot of times when I've ever tried
[586.44s -> 594.28s]  to play a fighting game like this or anything like this, hitting X and waiting 0.3 seconds
[595.24s -> 603.37s]  X. X. I can't do it. The net code is amazing. I don't know what they did or how they did it,
[603.37s -> 615.54s]  but seriously, it's so good. Yeah, no, that's it. That is my honest to goodness opinion.
[615.54s -> 627.82s]  Rollback net code. Yeah. And man, it's good. So from my understanding, I didn't know this before,
[628.74s -> 635.80s]  this game is supposed to be played with teams. Each character has, from my understanding,
[636.68s -> 650.15s]  different party moves. It's not really designed for 1v1. I guess it is, but I'm not surprised how
[650.15s -> 660.30s]  good the net code is. I'm not surprised. I played this already. Remember when I got cut off and I
[660.30s -> 709.88s]  wanted to play it so bad? Let's go up two for two. Here we go. Give me that shield. I don't know what
[709.88s -> 743.03s]  just happened. Sorry. We're good. We're good. We're good. Just pull it together. Pull it together.
[743.03s -> 784.68s]  Get two kills here. Don't let him do that. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[787.48s -> 835.96s]  Team. Give me some. Give me some. Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[841.43s -> 866.25s]  That's huge. Pull it together. Make it happen. Get these two kills and we're good.
[879.88s -> 896.34s]  Don't let them get away. This guy just bouncing around. Just get rid of them.
[896.98s -> 910.76s]  Whew. All right. That was a little sloppy. That was a little sloppy, but I'll take it.
[911.32s -> 924.04s]  That was a little sloppy. Should I try the new silent streamer? Dude, I'm just cranking out the
[924.04s -> 944.54s]  game. Do a backflip? Wait, I gotta tweet. Let's go. Tweet out. I had to warm up. I had to warm up a
[944.54s -> 960.33s]  little. So are you guys getting drops? Does it work? You have to watch for an hour? Okay. Just
[960.33s -> 965.59s]  want to make sure it works. All right. This is the new character. This is an iron giant.
[965.59s -> 983.69s]  Should I just get my ass kicked with iron giant? Is he any good? He's whoa. Okay. I'll try it.
[991.19s -> 996.49s]  I'm so, I'm so excited, man. I, you know, I've been waiting to play a game like this.
[1002.62s -> 1006.14s]  So I, I'm going to let my Batman down here. I have no idea what the moves are.
[1006.14s -> 1022.06s]  I don't have a single clue. You're going to make, yeah, you gotta,
[1022.06s -> 1024.78s]  you gotta make a WB games account and then link your Twitch to it.
[1024.78s -> 1035.42s]  You can't keep doing this. All right. Let's see. What do you got? These eats. What does he eat?
[1036.22s -> 1059.93s]  He's huge. I think I'm doing okay. What's a grab? I'm just like in the way. Oh my God. This guy is
[1059.93s -> 1075.13s]  cracked. He's got a big butt storm. Protect friend. What's that mean? I think I have a defense move.
[1075.85s -> 1082.25s]  Whoa. It's like, I do have two different forms. All right. I gotta go look this up. I gotta go in
[1082.25s -> 1114.90s]  the lab. I just like big booted drop. We're still good. What does it down? What is up?
[1118.01s -> 1123.40s]  What just happened? I have no idea what I just did, but that guy was trapped.
[1129.77s -> 1132.09s]  I hit the guy with like a hundred frames frame data.
[1144.36s -> 1152.31s]  Shit. Sorry. So this is a colossal character. It's the first one that that makes sense.
[1152.31s -> 1164.78s]  He's really slow. I like that move. The big right hand.
[1171.54s -> 1177.74s]  Reagan hurts, you know. What does the side special do? I've got the giant.
[1180.92s -> 1190.22s]  I think the side special is a grab. I have like a power up. I can protect the friend. He's really
[1190.22s -> 1209.00s]  good. Let's do that again. I guess so. I'll do it. He can fight. Well, is iron giant technically
[1209.00s -> 1220.14s]  fighting? He's like punching cars and stuff, right? I don't know. Should I do bugs? All right. I want
[1220.14s -> 1233.16s]  to level up bugs money. If you say so, I got to find out the scenario to use some of his moves
[1233.16s -> 1241.62s]  because the bugs is cool, but he's got a lot of cool downs. You're playing the little brother.
[1242.66s -> 1245.70s]  Well, guess what? Man, the little brother has not lost a match since starting.
[1250.44s -> 1260.46s]  This is, this is fun. This is fun. I'll do some one V ones after this.
[1264.82s -> 1286.78s]  That was a good stun right to start it. Be careful. Don't get too trapped over there.
[1296.18s -> 1319.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wrong move. Oh my, I almost hit him with the end of that rocket.
[1338.12s -> 1353.66s]  Hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him. Ooh, nice. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[1363.22s -> 1383.91s]  Knock it over there. Yep. Denial area denial. Getting sloppy. No, we pulled it back. We pulled
[1383.91s -> 1395.50s]  it back. Bugs has an amazing up air. That bat swinging the bat up is awesome. By the way,
[1395.90s -> 1417.29s]  this game is going to be free to play. It's free to play. Buy an announcer pack. Okay. I kind of
[1417.29s -> 1444.50s]  want to take the iron giant into the lab. Should I take that? I want to learn how to do it. Let me
[1444.50s -> 1458.09s]  go back. I want to see, because I don't want to just press buttons. Okay. So that's his charge
[1458.09s -> 1466.54s]  move. That looks cool. What's the combo? The combo is just the smash, smash, butt bounce. Okay.
[1467.18s -> 1472.42s]  What about up air? I mean up. All right. So that's what I was doing. He actually throws something.
[1474.36s -> 1479.40s]  You can. All right. The projectile can be the longer you hold it. Oh, that's annoying.
[1479.40s -> 1489.51s]  That's going to be so annoying. You just be an annoying shithead here. Okay. So that's what
[1489.51s -> 1500.60s]  that does. What about down? So down attack makes these bolts that you eat. And what after how many
[1500.76s -> 1513.93s]  Okay. You have max of five bolts. What are the bolts do? Let's find out. Okay. So that's that.
[1513.93s -> 1517.45s]  All right. What is the standard? What does this do? So that's the grab was a grab. That's it.
[1518.49s -> 1525.14s]  He just kind of grabs. All right. I just used bolts. Oh, it's a shield. I get it.
[1528.23s -> 1539.08s]  Bro. You probably do it again, bro. Why is the computer fighting back? Okay. That's what you
[1539.08s -> 1562.33s]  want to do. It's up and X. Okay. So that's yeah, I can pick where this goes. Okay. All right. That's
[1562.33s -> 1566.09s]  why I was having trouble figuring out what that was doing. If you just do it in the air, you go
[1566.09s -> 1574.89s]  straight down. All right. And if you that's obviously dodge. Okay. So what about what is
[1574.89s -> 1584.22s]  the standard standard? Special is just is it hurt? No, I think it's just shield is the grab
[1584.22s -> 1599.62s]  the butt stomp is up special. Okay. I think that uses a bolt. Do I fly with this? Okay. All right.
[1599.62s -> 1608.12s]  Doesn't seem that complicated. I have a better idea what's happening. Protect friends. Yeah,
[1608.12s -> 1625.72s]  what is this? This is a whole new move set now. Okay, that's awesome. How did I get that to happen?
[1626.36s -> 1640.87s]  I think it is build a meter. Yeah, it's a meter you build. I can aim that kind of like a like a
[1640.87s -> 1660.17s]  helicopter blade. All right, I think I get it. Let's do it. Let's do it in the game. Does
[1660.17s -> 1668.20s]  exclamation point drops do anything? I don't think that does anything. I don't think that does
[1668.20s -> 1674.01s]  anything. Why is everybody doing that? Oh, it Okay, people are just spamming. I get it. Okay.
[1675.58s -> 1687.56s]  That doesn't do anything. What was I was? Where's my? Let me see. Okay, we're good.
[1688.12s -> 1695.19s]  I'm gonna try to play another game with iron giant. I think I have some currency too.
[1702.34s -> 1711.59s]  All right, teams again, let me let me do some one v ones free for all. Okay, I'm gonna do one v one.
[1711.59s -> 1721.22s]  Let's see how badly I get my ass kicked. Choose your character. Should I do? I'm not confident
[1721.22s -> 1738.33s]  with iron giant. But whatever, I'll get beat up. Classic. You're like a child on Christmas morning.
[1738.33s -> 1746.04s]  I've been waiting to get back into this for at least a month or two since it was last year.
[1746.84s -> 1762.55s]  I'm so excited. Iron giant is a good movie. Iron giant is a good movie. I agree. All right,
[1762.55s -> 1767.11s]  Harley Quinn. Prepare yourself. I'll see how annoying I can be with this character.
[1773.96s -> 1781.82s]  Oh, let's do it. All right, I gotta walk in for this one. Two ring outs.
[1782.38s -> 1785.85s]  We'll go for one right off the bat immediately. I'm gonna go for a crazy play here. Watch this.
[1786.89s -> 1809.16s]  What's on me? I got like a bomb on me.
[1854.57s -> 1867.88s]  Sorry. Sorry. I'm getting styled on right now. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[1870.84s -> 1902.10s]  I got to learn how to do some of these moves.
[1912.34s -> 1920.22s]  Continue. No, that was a good fight. That said, that second heat there,
[1921.74s -> 1927.82s]  I got absolutely styled on. That was R. I got destroyed. You didn't use your shield one time.
[1932.07s -> 1944.50s]  Should I do Taz? No, we'll go 1v1 bucks. The earwig in your brain is getting to you right now.
[1944.66s -> 1954.74s]  Do a Taz impression. No, no, no. Sponsor stream. Whatever. Why not?
[1969.70s -> 1973.38s]  I was just about to... Okay, that Taz mania was just about to do that.
[1974.34s -> 1984.66s]  Somebody hit man style, like put a piano wire around his neck. What was that? What was that?
[1985.98s -> 1998.62s]  I was like... All right, let's go. Main versus main. You got your Harley Quinn. I've got my bucks.
[1999.42s -> 2013.75s]  Oh, best out of three. Let's do it. Both earbuds in. I'm going hard here.
[2088.66s -> 2092.58s]  I figured she was gonna jump over me. So I was like, you know what? I'm gonna keep up a
[2092.58s -> 2099.37s]  fall on the other direction. Figured that was gonna happen. Good job. Good fight. Good fight.
[2099.45s -> 2122.62s]  Okay. Read like a book. I almost did my starter mission, guys. Why did you take your smart pills
[2122.62s -> 2137.03s]  today? I think a lot of you might be concerned that I like a video game and I might be kind of
[2137.03s -> 2158.01s]  good at it. I'm really not, though. I'm just excited. All right, Superman's good. Oh wait,
[2158.01s -> 2170.33s]  I have perks, don't I? Can I put them on right here? You ate your Flintstone vitamins?
[2170.33s -> 2184.09s]  I mean, I had vitamins today. Maybe that helps. You're getting carried so hard by the earwig.
[2184.89s -> 2209.69s]  The earwig is in control right now. I don't know what happened there. That was weird.
[2210.25s -> 2274.18s]  Thought he was gonna jump. Oh, shit. He's bringing it back. Oh, what? Nice recovery. Holy smokes.
[2274.18s -> 2277.85s]  I forgot how to play video game. I forgot how to play it. I forgot how to play it. I'm all right.
[2277.85s -> 2324.10s]  I'm good. I'm good. I forgot how to play. I forgot how to play. I forgot how to play the game.
[2324.82s -> 2388.86s]  I didn't want to taunt. What? What the hell are you doing? What happened? All right.
[2391.91s -> 2394.31s]  I got to dig down into... That was a good fight. Let's do it again.
[2397.29s -> 2408.30s]  Paid actor. Paid actor. He probably dropped his controller on the ground.
[2415.46s -> 2419.78s]  Whoever that is, they're probably screaming because they had me. They had me right where
[2419.78s -> 2423.38s]  they wanted me and they probably dropped their controller and it probably smashed on the ground
[2423.38s -> 2430.06s]  and they grabbed it really quick. All right. I have to stick with bugs. This guy's got a pretty
[2430.06s -> 2450.38s]  good Superman. All right. Hold on. Wait. I guess I'll just put these on, right? Till I have paid
[2450.38s -> 2466.17s]  actor. The mods are having a lot of fun over here. They're saying the other guy's earwig died. Same
[2466.17s -> 2474.20s]  person. Yeah, that was a good match. All right. Let's go. I got my coffee. I got my controller.
[2503.45s -> 2553.86s]  I forgot how to play the game. What's happening? My earwig is fucking having trouble. My earwig is
[2553.86s -> 2557.46s]  pressing a bunch of buttons in my brain. Stop pressing the button that wants me to go get a
[2557.46s -> 2635.34s]  pizza. Didn't taunt. Good grab. Good grab. Good grab. Good grab. Good grab. Sorry.
[2641.02s -> 2655.37s]  Why is he playing with his whole body? Because I'm in the game. Paid earwig.
[2661.14s -> 2673.43s]  Lightning's going through my body. No, it's not paid earwig. I'm sorry I keep screaming too,
[2673.43s -> 2682.34s]  by the way. By the way, connect your WB account to your Twitch. If you watch here,
[2682.34s -> 2690.25s]  you got to watch for an hour. Be an active participant. The actual, the open beta is July
[2690.25s -> 2699.91s]  26th, by the way. PlayStation. I was holding that in for like 10 straight seconds.
[2701.32s -> 2704.28s]  It's on PlayStation. It's on Xbox. It's on PC.
[2704.28s -> 2709.86s]  Easy does it, old sport.
[2715.26s -> 2719.18s]  My earwig in my brain right now. He's just like, he's covered in sweat.
[2720.76s -> 2736.92s]  Yeah, exclamation point drops doesn't do anything. Oh, this is Ari Stark. I just want to make sure
[2736.92s -> 2740.92s]  everyone's aware of this. I've not lost a match yet the whole time I've been screaming in this game.
[2742.04s -> 2747.78s]  We are undefeated. I mean, yeah, we're in, we're in like the first 10 levels, but whatever.
[2754.76s -> 2757.72s]  Earwig Mom said it's my turn to play the Xbox. No, it's not.
[2786.58s -> 2801.48s]  Dammit. Whoa, are you serious? Bugs Bunny talking smack about Game of Thrones? You kidding me?
[2801.48s -> 2835.10s]  Best character in the game. Good dodge. Shoot it up.
[2862.30s -> 2882.01s]  I did that on purpose. I did that. I did. I did that on purpose.
[2882.49s -> 2885.19s]  Pretended to freak out every time I fall off the edge.
[2891.38s -> 2896.70s]  Show us the controller. We don't believe it's you. Oh, I got it in my hand.
[2897.34s -> 2904.38s]  What do you mean? I'm playing. Easy does it, old sport.
[2907.24s -> 2914.42s]  God. Okay. Playing fighting games online. I have to be very honest. I'm going to be
[2914.42s -> 2923.75s]  incredibly upfront and very honest. There's not been one match, one single match this whole time
[2923.75s -> 2939.40s]  that has felt off. This is a breath of fresh air. It truly is. It's been like 10 to 15 matches.
[2941.18s -> 2996.23s]  No input delay. God. I've been waiting for a decade for this. Didn't expect that.
[2998.89s -> 3003.61s]  That combo. Holy shit. Oh my God. Good player. Good player. Very good player.
[3003.61s -> 3048.78s]  I can still do it. I guess I still got it.
[3154.63s -> 3161.03s]  Damn. Oh, good. Good. Good. Oh, that was clean at the end there.
[3162.86s -> 3169.77s]  That was a good fight. That was a good fight. I slipped up a few times there. Slipped up a few.
[3169.77s -> 3177.88s]  Let's do it again. Let's do it again. He's going to get, he's holding back toxic Andy.
[3177.88s -> 3188.65s]  Toxic. What are you talking about? Choose your character. I unplugged my controller.
[3189.21s -> 3195.43s]  What do you mean toxic? Every time I got a move done to me, that was good. I'm like, good move.
[3195.43s -> 3202.33s]  Oh, great. A great throw. Prepare for my deftifying exploits.
[3203.13s -> 3213.05s]  All right. Let's try that again. That was intense. My, my blood is on fire right now.
[3213.05s -> 3234.50s]  All right. I pull it back. Let's go. Prepare yourself. All right. It's so fun. All right.
[3234.50s -> 3238.10s]  We got best of three here.
[3271.64s -> 3292.26s]  Face stolen. What the hell happened? Give me that. Give me that. Give me that. Don't let you have
[3292.26s -> 3381.19s]  that. Oh, all right. All right. 45, 45, 45, 45. There it is. Good fight.
[3381.19s -> 3386.79s]  All right. My dog keeps farting and I'm going to throw up. Please win this match.
[3387.51s -> 3394.30s]  All right. I just, I did. I'll just leave the room, dude. Why are you still there?
[3397.51s -> 3401.51s]  Just open up your door and walk out and just watch from the hallway.
[3420.55s -> 3432.65s]  You want the, no, the dog just check DMS. What? What happened? I have an ant man shirt.
[3432.65s -> 3449.38s]  Wait, what? Wait, check like my Twitter DMS. I don't have it. Oh, I do have a Twitter.
[3451.61s -> 3467.02s]  Jerma wanna play. It's Hassan. You want to play? I mean, I, I, I got a pretty mean bugs bunny.
[3467.02s -> 3472.94s]  Easy does it old sport. I got a Hassan DM to me on Twitter. He's like, hey, let's go. Let's
[3472.94s -> 3486.38s]  fucking play. All right. Let me, let me do a few more cracked out games. I don't even know how to
[3486.38s -> 3501.75s]  add somebody. Could you add them in like the WB account thing? Another Harley Quinn.
[3502.47s -> 3506.58s]  Prepare yourself. It's probably on the main menu.
[3510.73s -> 3515.29s]  Hassan, do you want a one V one or do you want a two V two? What do you want to do?
[3515.29s -> 3559.78s]  I hope this match is televised. All right. I'll pull it together here. Hello. Oh, give me this
[3559.78s -> 3631.14s]  bomb. What lap is this? Oh shit. I'm gamer fatigue is setting in gamer. I got, I got gamer fatigue.
[3631.14s -> 3644.79s]  Hold on. All right. Pull it together. Pull it together. Pull it together. Let's go.
[3717.05s -> 3721.45s]  It's a hundred degrees in here. It's a hundred degrees in this room. It's a hundred degrees in
[3721.45s -> 3745.77s]  here. Oh, how do I toast? Dude, did smoke just come out of his ears? That's the second Harley
[3745.77s -> 3756.28s]  Quinn that's kicked my ass. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. This, I love this dude.
[3756.28s -> 3761.77s]  Did smoke just come out of his ears? They beat you. I know I got, I, my air game has got to be
[3761.77s -> 3781.06s]  better. Ear wig overheating. Choose your character. It's a hundred degrees Kelvin. All right. Let me
[3781.06s -> 3785.70s]  do one more and then what, what, let me, let me, let me DM Hassan and see what he wants to do.
[3785.70s -> 3811.37s]  You want a one V one bro or two V two. Oh, I actually wrote, I actually said bro. Oops. All
[3811.37s -> 3815.80s]  right. I gotta, I gotta, we gotta go back to the basics here. Tasmanian Delta. I don't even know
[3815.80s -> 3837.80s]  how to play. If we're going to play together, I want no talking. We silently sit in a call
[3837.80s -> 3858.63s]  and I clear my throat every four to five seconds. Do you accept those terms? I just stare. All right.
[3858.63s -> 3865.46s]  Tasmanian Devil. I think I remember some of the stuff about Tas. Yeah. He's got the salt shakers.
[3883.16s -> 3906.18s]  This guy is a horse. What's happening? Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[3915.66s -> 3933.11s]  Anyway, I got to eat them. No, I want to eat you. Not the other way around. Come on.
[3977.29s -> 3987.54s]  Every time I go off the side of the cliff, I fucking panic, dude. I go off the side and I go
[3989.45s -> 4013.32s]  and I fucking die. That's part of the game, man. Okay. Hold on. So how do I add,
[4013.32s -> 4017.02s]  how do I add you? All right. Let me get, I'm going to add Hassan on Discord.
[4018.94s -> 4024.28s]  You have to 430. Isn't that like 12 minutes? All right. Let's go.
[4027.51s -> 4036.01s]  All right. Let's, let's get, let's make this happen. Dude, if I 1v1 Hassan. Oh man. I'll,
[4036.01s -> 4047.70s]  can you imagine? Show the, show the bugs bunny. Okay. Add friend. I didn't have you as a friend
[4047.70s -> 4082.14s]  on Discord. Okay. I send you a friend request. Okay. What if, what if I've just like juggle,
[4082.14s -> 4086.63s]  juggle, juggle, juggle, juggle, kick, kick, juggle, juggle. Juggle, juggle, kick, kick,
[4086.63s -> 4099.70s]  juggle, juggle, juggle. What if he beats my ass? He's going to, he's going to beat my ass.
[4100.34s -> 4111.83s]  I'm going to have to go full bugs on this one. He's currently in the tutorial. Oh,
[4111.83s -> 4134.25s]  we got this then. Oh, we got this then. It's calling me right now. Hello. What's up? Oh my
[4134.25s -> 4139.13s]  God. I'm a Germaniac and this is a very special moment for me. I'm just letting you know.
[4140.65s -> 4143.53s]  You want to do 1v1? I heard you're in this. Is that what you call, is that what you call
[4143.53s -> 4147.66s]  your fan base? Are they Germaniac? No, you got it wrong. You got it wrong. It's all right.
[4148.62s -> 4153.66s]  What do you call your fan base? It's, it's the Germamites. It's the Germamites? Yeah. I,
[4153.66s -> 4159.50s]  I don't have a cool name like that. Mine are Hassanabi heads. Prepare yourself. I just like
[4159.50s -> 4163.02s]  joined a game. I, I, all right. Let me, let me, let me, let me style on somebody real quick.
[4163.66s -> 4169.10s]  Okay. I don't know how to play this game at all. So you are going to destroy me if we 1v1. Oh,
[4169.10s -> 4175.53s]  then okay. Well, I'll go easy. I'll play a character I don't play. We can do 2v2. Can we
[4175.53s -> 4180.97s]  like pair up and like beat on other people and then you carry me? I mean, I'm, I'm not very good
[4180.97s -> 4185.29s]  at this game either. I'm just, you know, I, I've done, I've dabbled a little. I think you're being
[4185.29s -> 4189.53s]  modest. No, we're going to get absolutely on if we do this together. Did you ask your parents
[4189.53s -> 4196.25s]  before turning on mature language? Uh, yeah. Okay. Good. I didn't. I'm being a bad boy right now.
[4197.05s -> 4200.94s]  All right. Are you, are you watching my stream right now? Watch, watch me, watch me dunk on this
[4200.94s -> 4205.42s]  Superman. Ready? Check this out. Okay. Let's do it. Hold on. Hold on. I'm pulling you up right now.
[4206.38s -> 4209.66s]  I'm pulling you up. This is a test though. This is like a trial to see how good you are.
[4211.58s -> 4229.96s]  Is that communist Superman? Is that Superman? Is he red? Oh, he is red.
[4232.60s -> 4236.12s]  Yeah. You distracted me. You distracted me. You distracted me.
[4263.19s -> 4280.42s]  I won't make that mistake again. Hey, what happened? Don't you dare. Oh, I should have
[4280.42s -> 4285.22s]  ended it right there. That was stupid. All right. Everybody quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,
[4286.41s -> 4324.10s]  quiet, quiet, quiet. You like that cancel play the game. I swear to God. Oh my fuck. It's all right.
[4324.66s -> 4332.42s]  It's all right. It's all right. Did I just turn the stream off? Hello. Can you hear me?
[4333.14s -> 4340.42s]  Your stream was on. Okay. So what, what happened there? You want to do a little
[4340.42s -> 4345.22s]  post game analysis there? What went wrong? All right. So what went wrong is I'm suffering
[4345.22s -> 4349.94s]  from a little bit of gamer fatigue. It's 125 degrees in my room and Superman is overpowered.
[4349.94s -> 4355.94s]  He's got like, he's got a bunch of powerful moves. And I, I tried to juggle, but it,
[4356.90s -> 4360.58s]  look at the thermometer above here. It's 140 degrees in here. That's what happened.
[4361.22s -> 4368.23s]  It's just too hot in here. Yeah. It seems like you're, you're making excuses. It seems like
[4368.23s -> 4372.79s]  you are failing on the front of the phrase. It's just the game is such a weak mindset. Jerma.
[4373.59s -> 4378.31s]  I had it. I had it in the bag. I really do. I swear. You are okay with what happened losing
[4378.31s -> 4383.19s]  imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you've lost twice. There's
[4383.19s -> 4387.75s]  always something to learn and always room for improvement. Dude, I get, I get angry at every
[4387.75s -> 4393.35s]  little thing in the world. If the toilet paper has no toilet paper on it, I, in a rage, I grab
[4393.35s -> 4399.85s]  the cardboard and just crush it. You have no idea what I was referencing just there. Do you?
[4399.85s -> 4404.49s]  Well, you said, you said getting angry twice is bad, right? No, I said the phrase is just the game
[4404.49s -> 4410.23s]  is such a weak. I was just reading a Ninja tweet. Oh, I don't know any of this shit. I don't know
[4410.23s -> 4416.39s]  anything about anybody. Okay. It's all good. It's all good. Okay. I thought you were, I thought you
[4416.39s -> 4419.99s]  were helping me through that. I thought you were playing with a controller or keyboard and mouse
[4419.99s -> 4425.35s]  because why would you play with a keyboard about, I don't know. Some people are sweaty like that,
[4425.35s -> 4431.10s]  but the reason why I ask you is because like, I'm really bad and I've never, I'm, I need your
[4431.10s -> 4438.22s]  advice on this. You have an Xbox controller. Yeah. Okay. Xbox. I'm trying to do a forward air
[4438.22s -> 4443.10s]  special currently or wait, a down air special. Okay. I'm doing the tutorial and I lost doing
[4443.10s -> 4447.66s]  the tutorial at first. Let's use our strength. You lost in the tutorial. I died during the,
[4447.66s -> 4451.26s]  during the tutorial. I mean, it's a hard game. It's, it's a, it's like a fighting game. Have
[4451.26s -> 4458.31s]  you played a lot of smash? Okay. You're playing smash. I've never played smash. No, I've literally
[4458.31s -> 4461.83s]  never played really. So this, this is going to be hard to explain some things then. Yeah.
[4462.89s -> 4467.77s]  Yeah. That's what I mean. I'm like legit worried about this, but it'll be all right with you by
[4467.77s -> 4474.25s]  my side. I think, uh, I think I, I, I have all of the, the necessary tools. Okay. So how do I
[4474.25s -> 4479.45s]  add you as a friend here? Oh, I don't know. Hold on. That's a good question. Real quick.
[4480.41s -> 4483.21s]  I don't want to show your, uh, do you care about getting your name shown? Do you have like the
[4483.21s -> 4489.30s]  notifications turned off? Turn them off if you don't. Um, I don't know on what is it you
[4490.02s -> 4496.82s]  like the actual multi-versus client? No, I don't even know if I have it on right now.
[4497.78s -> 4504.15s]  Is that how we're a multi-versus client is what it's WB games. Yeah. Just, just, just like, uh,
[4504.15s -> 4507.27s]  in your settings, just make sure you have your like invite notifications off. Cause when they
[4507.27s -> 4511.59s]  see it, they're going to go, you know, you're going to get pinged. All right, let's do it.
[4511.59s -> 4518.15s]  All right. So how do you manage? Oh, okay. Here we go. What is your invite from friends only? No,
[4518.15s -> 4523.03s]  I'm just going to have it open for now. So what's your, I'll tell you what my username is. I think
[4523.03s -> 4528.39s]  you can find me that way. Okay. Right. I don't even know where to find, uh, friends though.
[4528.95s -> 4533.03s]  I can add you. It's so in the, in the top, right, there's like a tab menu. You open that up.
[4533.03s -> 4535.99s]  It shows you who you played with, who you're friends with, and, or your, your online steam
[4535.99s -> 4541.80s]  friends and all that stuff. Oh, we can do it through steam, right? I, we probably can just do
[4541.80s -> 4546.20s]  it through WB. Okay. Let's do it through WB then. What's your in-game name in, uh, in the
[4546.76s -> 4552.52s]  multi-versus? That's, I just wrote it in the discord chat. Oh, okay. I think that's what it
[4552.52s -> 4561.00s]  is in my WB. Uh, that's what it is. I hope this is right. I think so. Let's see. That's you.
[4561.00s -> 4570.81s]  You have open invites. Yeah. Okay. I just invited you to a party. Did you get it? Hold on. I have
[4570.81s -> 4576.15s]  a weird name. It's like a two V two. I think we can, I think we're going to do two V two.
[4578.07s -> 4582.39s]  Wait, we're just going right in. I mean, you invited me for a two V two, right? That's what
[4582.39s -> 4588.20s]  you invited me for. Oh, I just, I kind of, I just invited you to a party. It just said,
[4588.20s -> 4592.84s]  I mean, your name is about to show up. I'm just letting you know. Oh, it doesn't matter. It's
[4592.84s -> 4599.64s]  all right. Okay. You're, you're this, right? You're, you're Shaggy just like I am. Yeah. Yeah. I play,
[4599.64s -> 4603.80s]  I play Bugs Bunny. I'm a Bugs Bunny player. I've got a lot of experience playing Bugs or Taz.
[4604.68s -> 4609.80s]  Okay. My, my selection, my character selection process oftentimes revolves around who I think
[4609.80s -> 4616.06s]  is the coolest looking character. Who do you think? Um, Bugs Bunny. We're going to do dual
[4616.06s -> 4621.18s]  bugs. We could, but we're going to, no, no, no, no, expert. Oh no. Iron giant is expert. No,
[4621.18s -> 4625.34s]  iron giant is actually putting iron giant. It's good. It's really, really heavy. Really, really
[4625.34s -> 4630.66s]  hard to knock off the stage. I would, I would recommend it. Dude, just press every, just press
[4630.66s -> 4636.38s]  every face button, like just mash buttons. You'll be all right. Wait, I have a ticket. Okay. I
[4636.38s -> 4640.30s]  unlocked them. Wait, you got in trouble. Why do you have like a ticket? Do you have a ticket
[4640.30s -> 4645.18s]  like in the game? No, like I unlocked them with a face ticket or something. That's what it's. Oh,
[4645.18s -> 4650.70s]  it's like, oh, I got a ticket. All right. Iron giant classic. No, let's go with the default.
[4650.70s -> 4655.10s]  Look. Okay. We're, I'm ready to go. We're going to get, we're going to get annihilated.
[4657.59s -> 4662.23s]  All right. Do I say wait in lab? I don't know. Yeah. It's two v two. Are you ready? This is,
[4662.23s -> 4666.63s]  this is baptism by fire, man. You ready? Dude, I'm so ready. I don't even know what the,
[4666.63s -> 4671.96s]  what the buttons do, but I'm ready. All right. So what do you have for a controller?
[4673.05s -> 4678.33s]  I have a, uh, a PS five controller. Okay. So square is your kind of regular attack.
[4679.05s -> 4684.01s]  If you hold square and not move, you'll do a power charge and that's a big power charge move.
[4684.57s -> 4691.88s]  If you hold up and X or square places, do you have, uh, do you have perks by the way? Yeah.
[4691.88s -> 4695.96s]  You got, you got to level a character up first. Oh, damn. You have, you leveled your character
[4695.96s -> 4702.28s]  up already level seven. Maybe play for like an hour, hour and a half. Damn. You're so good, dude.
[4703.69s -> 4709.14s]  I'm telling you, you're going to like this game. Okay. So all you got to do is just get in front
[4709.14s -> 4713.30s]  of them and what this person has something here. What is this? They have all the per this one has
[4713.30s -> 4719.62s]  the Velma has all the perks. Prepare your shot painted target. Okay. The coconut mints coming
[4719.62s -> 4725.22s]  out for this one has on. Okay. Just tell me what buttons to press and I'm going to press them.
[4725.22s -> 4730.74s]  You're, you're going to be pressing triangle in directions and a square and directions up and
[4730.74s -> 4734.18s]  triangle is a recovery move. If you fall off the stage, why am I talking into the camera? Like
[4734.18s -> 4749.11s]  you're here. Let's go. Oh my God. Oh my God. Just stay in the way. Really powerful. What is this?
[4749.11s -> 4758.63s]  Yeah. He's really good. No, no, just don't fall off stage. Yep. You're good. I can fly. Oh,
[4760.76s -> 4764.52s]  you know, it's awesome. I get to be the big brother in this scenario. It's the first time
[4764.52s -> 4772.57s]  I've ever experienced something like this. No. Okay. He's 76. Good. Or is that bad? You don't
[4772.57s -> 4790.34s]  want your number to be higher. You want to stay low. Good job. Good job. So far. Oh,
[4790.34s -> 4793.86s]  a hundred and seven hundred and 10. Oh my God. Am I kicking ass or what? Yeah.
[4801.98s -> 4808.62s]  Good. Oh my God. That was actually perfect. That was actually perfect. I swear to God. Oh,
[4808.62s -> 4818.33s]  no, no, no, no, no. Don't push me. Don't push me. We're gonna lead. Oh, wait, I can pick them up.
[4818.33s -> 4848.23s]  That's crazy. Let's go for the bully. They got armor too. So we can break through. It's crazy.
[4848.23s -> 4855.02s]  It's like it's getting me in the mood. Yeah. It has no business going this hard. Oh,
[4855.02s -> 4863.46s]  shit. Oh crap. Watch this. Goodbye. Where am I finding the cars to crumple them up? I don't
[4863.46s -> 4868.42s]  know how you still on the stage, but oh, there we go. Let's go. Okay. Well, it's fine. I died
[4868.42s -> 4881.14s]  once, but they've died multiple times, right? Yeah, we're good. Oh, get absolutely destroyed.
[4881.14s -> 4889.82s]  Velma, where are your glasses? Velma. Oh, I need those glasses to see how high I can throw you
[4889.82s -> 4895.18s]  up. That's it. That's it. That's it. Is there a dance? Can I do it? Can I do a dance like,
[4895.26s -> 4903.66s]  uh, uh, uh? Am I a gamer? Am I a gamer chat? It's cool. I just wanted to impress you,
[4903.66s -> 4907.34s]  Jerm. I was lying. I'm actually a professional gamer. I've played this game so many times.
[4907.34s -> 4912.46s]  Have you actually played this a lot? What? No, no, dude. Should we rematch? No, right? No,
[4912.46s -> 4918.34s]  why not? Let's do it again. I declined. We need someone better. Hey, they were good.
[4919.70s -> 4927.45s]  They knocked us off the stage. That was a good showing. That's the first time you've ever played.
[4927.45s -> 4939.02s]  Fired up right now. You have no idea. You got drops on. Yes. All right. Same deal. So yeah,
[4939.02s -> 4943.74s]  I enjoy. Okay. Once you get to a certain, you fill this bar that he has underneath his health.
[4944.86s -> 4950.06s]  If you hold triangle, you'll turn into kind of like a war machine and you have other moves.
[4952.28s -> 4958.46s]  Yeah. They're pretty, they're pretty good. Right. I, I'll be honest. I have no idea.
[4959.10s -> 4964.39s]  I think that's how it works. This is so sick. I'll go Taz.
[4968.41s -> 4972.33s]  Imagine not believing. Yeah. I mean, I didn't, I thought we were going to get destroyed,
[4972.33s -> 4977.56s]  but we did pretty good. You know, you didn't believe in me, but more importantly,
[4977.56s -> 4983.96s]  you didn't believe in yourself. No, I didn't. Am I going to get, are you going to get any more
[4983.96s -> 4988.60s]  gamer quotes to me that I'm going to misunderstand? No, it's fine. That was the last one. I'm never
[4988.68s -> 4995.29s]  doing that again. Do you have currency? You are, I forget that you are my age or in my,
[4995.29s -> 5000.09s]  in my age group. And therefore these kinds of things are impressive to zoomers, but not to you,
[5000.09s -> 5008.17s]  not to a esteemed gentleman such as yourself. Are you 30 31 32? I'm about to be 31 on July 25th.
[5008.17s -> 5012.49s]  All right. Well, happy early birthday. Thank you. I'm going to go with iron giant again,
[5012.49s -> 5018.79s]  because it says expert and I'm kind of an expert, I think. Right. He just gets in the way. He's just
[5018.79s -> 5023.35s]  really in the way. Yeah. Oh, I don't have enough gold to unlock the variant. Okay. We'll just keep
[5025.35s -> 5032.71s]  Do you have any skins? Oh, how do we know? Oh, wait, hold on. I got a perk. Let us put it on
[5036.73s -> 5045.37s]  Batman and Shaggy. Do you have any perks or just probably not? No, I have no perk. I do.
[5045.37s -> 5049.37s]  This was literally the first match I've ever done. I didn't even finish the tutorial. Oh, wait,
[5049.37s -> 5054.55s]  I do. Wait, do I have perks? I have a defensive perk, boundless energy. Now I have perks.
[5057.19s -> 5063.10s]  Well, you actually don't really need the tutorial. It's itself. Okay, here's just don't fall off the
[5063.10s -> 5071.35s]  stage. That's it. The higher your number is, the more you're going to travel when you get hit hard.
[5072.15s -> 5077.99s]  So if you're at 200 150, you're going to it's going to be easier to knock you off the stage.
[5077.99s -> 5082.31s]  Just don't fall off the stage. That's the entire game. Okay, got it. That sounds really simple.
[5083.11s -> 5088.31s]  I'm still going to mess it up. Probably. But I think the reason. Oh, no, this stage has a hole in it.
[5088.31s -> 5092.55s]  Oh, I'm so bad with holes. It's all right. They are. They probably will. They probably will be too.
[5094.95s -> 5101.03s]  No, this guy's name is noob destroyer. Isn't it? I mean, we're new. He's going to destroy us.
[5101.03s -> 5106.15s]  Oh, even better if we beat him. Batman is beating me senselessly and mercilessly. I got it. I'm
[5106.15s -> 5117.24s]  coming. Let me let me take aggro. Let me take aggro from the Batman. Oh, God. Oh, Batman is
[5117.24s -> 5133.06s]  noob destroying me pretty hard through Batman. Oh, yeah. Batman get absolutely destroyed.
[5133.06s -> 5154.60s]  Batman, what happened? Oh, no, it's all right. We're good. One time. No, no, I die. It's all
[5154.60s -> 5162.02s]  right. We're good. We're good. We're good. While I was trying to push him, that was a silly.
[5162.02s -> 5168.39s]  That was a silly death that happened right there. Good juggle. Good juggle.
[5169.83s -> 5189.43s]  We're good. Pull it back. What is a juggle? We're tied up. It's like when you juggle them,
[5189.43s -> 5194.07s]  like when you throw them off. Yep. This way, they bounce, bounce, bounce. My hands are hurting.
[5194.07s -> 5198.95s]  That's like how little gamer that's a little gamer muscles I have. It's all right. They're
[5198.95s -> 5215.77s]  getting some work today. Oh, be careful. Wait, what am I doing? You said be careful. I'm talking
[5215.77s -> 5219.45s]  about me out loud. Oh, it's anybody's game right now. Whoever falls off next is over.
[5220.81s -> 5229.00s]  Oh, well, I'm close to falling off then. No, we got new destroyed. Okay, we have to defeat them.
[5229.00s -> 5234.12s]  We have to defeat them in the marketplace of ideas. That was that was so close. That was so
[5234.12s -> 5241.24s]  close. Okay, my I'm weak. I'm weak on this map. This map has a lot of holes in it. Sorry. That's
[5241.24s -> 5247.46s]  hard. They'll just take a look at this and go. They'll fucking go run. Wait. Oh, crap. I think
[5247.46s -> 5254.60s]  I declined on accident. Damn it. I pressed X because I saw X. That was so close to that was
[5254.60s -> 5261.40s]  actually insanely close. We were down three to not three to one, three to nothing. We pulled it
[5261.40s -> 5269.00s]  back to three three. So don't worry. We just keep your channel. Thank you. Taz is good.
[5269.64s -> 5277.91s]  Let's get a learner play. Sorry, I failed you, Jerma. No, I got knocked off twice.
[5278.55s -> 5290.22s]  Go back to bugs. Should I buy this thing? That's half the fun. I'm gonna do that in a little bit.
[5291.02s -> 5296.54s]  Dude, I have this. Look at my damage control. No dumb mistakes. Oh, chat's doing gamma right now.
[5296.54s -> 5300.14s]  Let's play some damage control. No dumb mistakes. Get some good hits in and you'll win for sure.
[5300.86s -> 5308.62s]  Yeah, all we gotta do is keep recommending Shaggy. I didn't like Shaggy. He's too slow for me.
[5309.34s -> 5321.06s]  People say he's good. Arya Stark expert assassin. Hyper Game of Thrones. You know who is who was
[5321.06s -> 5325.62s]  good? Superman is actually really good at when I said that he's got like powerful moves pretty
[5325.86s -> 5329.38s]  easy to play. You just kind of have to float around and do the freeze breath of people.
[5330.10s -> 5334.42s]  All right, I'm unlocking Superman. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's go. I want communist Superman,
[5334.42s -> 5340.31s]  though, like the the red one. I'm sure it's available. Just use your unlockable ticket.
[5342.68s -> 5347.64s]  I did. I just did. I'm ready to go. I'm Superman. So you're so you're going to be communist Superman
[5347.64s -> 5353.00s]  and I'm going to be like rich bugs bunny. There's only one in the bathroom, man. I don't think I
[5353.00s -> 5358.82s]  can unlock communist man yet. I'm rich bugs bunny in the bathrobe when you're going to be
[5358.82s -> 5368.70s]  communist Superman. Yeah, it's yeah. Together we you know, it's the duality. You know what I mean?
[5368.70s -> 5380.22s]  I think we got it. All right. So you're Superman movement speed. I'm going to do defense stuff.
[5380.86s -> 5387.30s]  I don't have any sense. Yeah. If you start playing with the same character, you'll unlock stuff.
[5387.30s -> 5392.89s]  So what we said you had something to be like at 430 or something. You had something going on.
[5392.89s -> 5398.97s]  Prepare yourself. What is it? I asked this guy's toes. We wanted to play with me
[5399.61s -> 5404.01s]  because I found out that he was one of the people who was doing the hashtag ad,
[5404.01s -> 5407.85s]  which by the way, this is a hashtag ad. I think I need to say like the FTC thing.
[5407.85s -> 5416.74s]  But is it in your title? Yeah, it is. All right. This is an ad. Although, although the game is
[5416.74s -> 5428.02s]  fit. Oh, oh, get absolutely destroyed. Garnet. Oh, oh, oh, my God. I'm bouncing her off the wall.
[5429.54s -> 5450.74s]  Good. Good. You found your character. You found his car. Oh, shit. Okay. Boom. Boom. Oh, no. Oh,
[5450.74s -> 5455.14s]  bugs. When he's a mage character, right? That's why it's like got so many cool skills and stuff.
[5455.22s -> 5468.70s]  He's fun. Oh, I tossed their ass. Oh, shit. Get out of here. Get out of here.
[5469.74s -> 5475.66s]  See ya. Oh, get out of here. Oh, yeah. They're both. They're both down. They're about to get
[5475.66s -> 5484.73s]  blown up. Watch your head. Garnet is down. Good stuff. Oh, yeah. How about an adventure?
[5485.45s -> 5491.53s]  That was quite a line. What is she doing? Is she all thing? No, nobody has any old.
[5494.22s -> 5500.55s]  They bounce me off the platform, dude. I'm beating ass. I'm beating cheeks. I'm beating cheeks with
[5500.55s -> 5504.71s]  the Superman. Did you feel old when they asked you what how old you are in the beginning of the game
[5504.71s -> 5510.47s]  and it only went up to 22? Yeah. What's up with that? Yeah, that was weird. Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
[5510.55s -> 5516.90s]  sorry. I'm going to come back harder and stronger for that one.
[5520.02s -> 5527.70s]  Oh, they got speed up. What the hell? Don't matter. We got it. We got advantage. That doesn't
[5527.70s -> 5546.41s]  matter. I will give you a faster ticket out of here. Let's go. Wait, what does that do? What does
[5546.41s -> 5557.18s]  the star do? I don't know. All right. Go for the stuff on on on fin. It's all right. We got
[5557.18s -> 5565.69s]  we got match point here. He's done. He's done. He's not going to make it. Oh, yeah, he did make it.
[5570.34s -> 5574.50s]  Oh, just one hit. He's gone. He's won it. There he goes. All right. Let's go.
[5576.98s -> 5583.66s]  That was awesome. Dude. Oh, my God. Victory sounds so sweet. It feels so sweet. How fast can you
[5583.66s -> 5593.03s]  clap? Incredible. We are the greatest team. Can I hear a fast clap? How fast can you clap?
[5593.03s -> 5599.35s]  Wait, I want to do a rematch. I am down to defeat weak people in the marketplace of ideas now.
[5599.35s -> 5605.85s]  It's all right. I'll do it. Thank you, Warner Bros. for Warner Bros. Interactive for sponsoring
[5605.85s -> 5612.44s]  this. Yes. Thank you. Sponsored by Warner Bros. Interactive. That's what I was going to say. Yeah,
[5612.44s -> 5624.50s]  that's what we need to do. I've done it a few times. Hey, open beta is July 26. Yeah,
[5624.50s -> 5629.38s]  PlayStation access the open beta as long as you get, you know, you click the link in your chat
[5629.38s -> 5634.34s]  and create your WB account and you get drops. Drops are enabled on the stream. All you need
[5634.34s -> 5639.30s]  to do is watch for an hour. Dude, I'm so good for someone who never does hashtag ads. I'm
[5639.30s -> 5645.51s]  I'm doing it. I'm doing the damn. That was it. That was pretty good. That was a good ad. Thank
[5645.51s -> 5651.67s]  you. It's because of you. You're giving me the power to do it adequately. I think we got to,
[5651.67s -> 5657.43s]  I think your Superman is your guy here. I think you got a good Superman. Yeah, it didn't even hurt
[5659.90s -> 5663.66s]  my fingers playing Superman. Yeah. Do I have perks on that? You're talking about your hands were
[5663.66s -> 5669.10s]  hurting? When I was doing Iron Giant, I think it's because like, you know, it's a muscle. Like,
[5669.10s -> 5673.98s]  people always say, like, oh, gaming, like, it's not that, you know, it's not physically
[5673.98s -> 5677.42s]  strenuous, but they don't understand, like, you have gamer hands. You know what I mean? Like
[5677.42s -> 5683.74s]  the inside of my hand hurts a little bit from flexing so hard. Yeah. My sometimes my the thumb,
[5683.74s -> 5690.82s]  uh, like webs hurt, you know, you know what I mean by that? You have webbed thumbs like the web of
[5690.82s -> 5694.42s]  your thumb. Really good at swimming for that reason. Oh, this map, this map is good. This map is easy.
[5694.90s -> 5711.30s]  Yeah, it's like, uh, just nice and flat. I like that. Dude, I am bouncing. Taz is actually,
[5711.30s -> 5736.17s]  I got to learn how to play Taz. He's awesome. Okay. Nice. This game is freaking flying, brother. Oh,
[5736.17s -> 5743.05s]  crap. Oh, he's a turkey. I turned her into chicken dinner. We got him. Dude, that's what an awesome
[5743.05s -> 5746.97s]  power by Superman. You turn people into turkeys. That's I can't believe it. Did I do that? No,
[5746.97s -> 5750.73s]  yeah. Yeah, you did. He's got, I think there's a power of probably. No, that's a, you don't
[5750.73s -> 5756.22s]  remember the Superman cartoon. He would do his, uh, his heat ray and they would turn into dinner.
[5757.02s -> 5776.01s]  Oh, he's in trouble now. The people were playing bad or am I really good? Like,
[5776.01s -> 5779.53s]  I don't know what's going on. I think we just, we're just stringing it together. That's all.
[5780.33s -> 5794.98s]  We're, we've got good team chemistry. Oh, it's game over. Dude, what is that? What is going on
[5794.98s -> 5800.42s]  right now? Oh my God. You may, we're just playing well. We're playing well. Or you think we're just
[5800.42s -> 5806.34s]  beating on 11 year olds, which by the way, they deserve it. Okay. If you come at the king,
[5806.34s -> 5811.70s]  you best not miss. Okay. I don't care. These are equal opportunity hands that Superman has.
[5813.53s -> 5817.29s]  I mean, what time is it? Isn't it? What's, what's today? Tuesday at four 30.
[5818.25s -> 5827.34s]  Oh, I got an unlockable. What was it? Toast gold earned. I never, you know, what's really,
[5827.34s -> 5831.18s]  I don't know. This might be because I'm old, but like, I never know what the, the gold I
[5831.18s -> 5837.10s]  earn. Like, I don't know what any of this stuff is doing currently. I think you can use it to do
[5837.10s -> 5843.82s]  triple jump. Let's go. Okay. Did I have, do you have the premium pass? I don't know. I might.
[5844.78s -> 5850.54s]  It is that, is that what we got with like the unlock or no? I, maybe I think so. Cause I,
[5850.54s -> 5854.38s]  I hit it. I hit the unlock button. If you go to your battle, I got hella gold. Wait, what am I?
[5854.38s -> 5861.10s]  Oh my God. I didn't do any of the, I didn't realize that like, I had a bunch of gold from
[5861.18s -> 5867.90s]  and I have 2000 property Gleemium. Oh, we got to finish the starter missions. So you have to beat
[5867.90s -> 5873.50s]  the tutorial. I think. Oh my God. There's a taunt. I'm unlocking this taunt. Oh my God. That's crazy.
[5874.14s -> 5881.80s]  I can do pushups with my one finger. Maybe I'll do Velma. Velma's fun. Oh, I do. Yeah. I do have
[5881.80s -> 5890.65s]  these character tickets. That's right. Velma's interesting. She's got some fun moves. I unlocked
[5890.65s -> 5897.43s]  an announcer pack too. I don't know what that does, but like he kind of, the guy kind of looks like
[5897.43s -> 5916.86s]  you badges, max character badge that I've unlocked. Okay. I don't have any general, but edit perks.
[5916.86s -> 5923.50s]  I have triple jump, dude. It's probably like 500 degrees in here. Do you not have AC? What's going
[5923.50s -> 5931.86s]  on? I do, but I don't know. I just, I think I generate so much heat. Okay. I don't, I have a
[5931.86s -> 5936.50s]  Trump Tower Superman. What? How did you get that? One in a million, one million. It's a variant. It's
[5936.50s -> 5941.30s]  an epic variant. I think they gave it to me because I'm, I might be the best that they've ever seen.
[5941.30s -> 5945.38s]  That's what I'm getting a call from Warner Brothers Studios. They're saying like, I might be able to
[5945.38s -> 5953.37s]  make it pro. Really? Yeah. It's crazy. They're on the line right now. That's actually a really
[5953.37s -> 5956.09s]  cool skin. People are going to think you're really good at the game. So you're going to have to step
[5956.09s -> 5965.13s]  it up here. You're going to have to step it up. You don't have a gold skin and be bad at the game.
[5967.48s -> 5975.35s]  Can we do 2v2 with other people? I don't know. Is that possible? Lyrick is playing too. We could
[5975.35s -> 5981.78s]  get like Toast and Lyrick and then do a 2v2. I mean, I would do it if people want to play. They
[5981.78s -> 5990.07s]  would whoop our asses, I think. I mean, I don't know how sweaty they are. How? I mean, people
[5990.07s -> 5993.67s]  really haven't had access to the game in a while. I think everyone's kind of on the same playing
[5993.67s -> 6003.34s]  field. Here we go. Toast is a sweat. That's what they're saying in the chat. And Lyrick is a sweaty
[6003.34s -> 6008.78s]  gamer too. I think they would probably destroy us. This is the all-Boomer team. You, me, Lyrick,
[6008.78s -> 6017.53s]  Toast. Everyone's a Boomer. But it's all old? I don't know how old Toast is. I mean, I am sweating.
[6018.33s -> 6022.33s]  I wore a tank top specifically because I knew I was going to be heating up in here.
[6022.33s -> 6034.18s]  Wear tank tops is your thought, okay? B, F, E, 4, R, the elite, feared goblin. What do they mean by
[6034.18s -> 6038.58s]  that? What are they, like a clan? I think they're queuing. Well, we're queuing together.
[6039.22s -> 6044.23s]  This almost was a mirror. Should it be a mirror? Oh, it's too late.
[6049.67s -> 6055.19s]  I forget pretty much all of Velma's moves, but I'm going to try. I got you. I got you, King. I got
[6055.19s -> 6067.88s]  you. Let's do it. I hope we don't get destroyed by this clan. I love this song. What song is this
[6067.88s -> 6074.62s]  from? Let's do it. Wait, I thought you were golden. Why are you silver now? I am gold.
[6075.02s -> 6082.22s]  Just for you. What? I am gold. What do you mean? You're not gold. You're like 1930s Superman,
[6082.22s -> 6090.57s]  like black and white TV. No, I'm gold. On my screen, I'm gold. Oh, maybe it doesn't. I don't
[6090.57s -> 6099.74s]  know. I'm confused. Oh, God. They're beating my ass off. Oh, God. Superman. Chill. Chill. Chill.
[6099.74s -> 6124.15s]  No, no, I had triple jump. We're good. Wait, how do I pick up the power up?
[6126.63s -> 6145.58s]  Left trigger. No, don't die. Don't die on me. Yes. Oh, nice. Oh, Superman. Come on. Come on,
[6145.58s -> 6150.70s]  Gwen. Come on, Gwen. Oh, God. Oh, he's beating my ass. He's beating my ass in the QRTs.
[6151.66s -> 6158.22s]  I don't know. What does this mean? Oh, it's down. No, wait, what the fuck? Wait, how?
[6159.62s -> 6166.25s]  That's crazy that that happened. I don't know what I just did. Dude, what? Are we busted? Oh,
[6166.25s -> 6170.89s]  I think I killed him. No, we're okay. Wait, how is he not dead yet? We're good. We're in the lead.
[6178.60s -> 6198.74s]  Hey, they got gamer fatigue. We're good. Oh, God. Sorry. Match point. Match point. Let's get it.
[6198.74s -> 6225.93s]  Oh, no. Enemy team advantage. Juggle. No. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Superman. Bully Superman. Get
[6225.93s -> 6231.93s]  Superman. Bully Superman. Get Superman. Bully Superman. Get Superman. Bully Superman. Bully
[6231.93s -> 6252.06s]  Superman. No, this is tough. This is tough. These guys are good. Dude, we just got to hit him one
[6252.06s -> 6256.46s]  time. I got him. I got him. I got him. He's gone. He's gone. Oh, he's not gone. You got it. He's
[6256.46s -> 6266.12s]  gone now. Let's go. We did it. We're good. Let's go. Let's go. I choked. I choked. Oh, crap.
[6268.15s -> 6274.20s]  Dude, I'm doing so many YouTube faces. I've never tasted the sweet nectar of victory before.
[6275.56s -> 6281.80s]  I get owned so regularly normally. I know. Doesn't it feel great? I've never been good at a video
[6281.80s -> 6285.40s]  game my whole life besides Elden Ring. And in real life, if somebody threw an axe at me, I would
[6285.40s -> 6292.54s]  dodge it. Are you? Wow. Okay. I'm bad at video games, but if you if somebody swung an axe at
[6292.54s -> 6300.31s]  me in real life, I would dodge it. Really? How are you so confident in that? Just trust me on that.
[6301.11s -> 6304.31s]  Lyric is the Emmy. He said, yo, I'm down to group if you guys actually want to group. Not sure if
[6304.31s -> 6310.84s]  Chad is trolling. Can we actually physically do it? I don't know. Can we do a four cube?
[6313.18s -> 6324.42s]  Wait, I have a new move. Oh, shit. I don't. I don't know why I'm not unlocking any new perks,
[6324.42s -> 6328.02s]  honestly. I don't know what's going on. I think the game is basically saying like,
[6328.98s -> 6333.30s]  we don't want to give you more perks because you're already so cracked. You know what I mean?
[6333.30s -> 6340.50s]  Yeah, I feel that I do. I think you just have to get to like level 10 20. No, I like I'm pretty
[6340.50s -> 6344.82s]  sure the game is like we noticed that like, you know, we don't want to hit you with a vac ban.
[6344.82s -> 6348.98s]  Like we noticed that you're too good for the game. Like we suspect that you might be cheating.
[6349.14s -> 6356.26s]  No one is this good. All right. Pencil pencils down on paper. Let's go. Oh, I hate this. I hate
[6356.26s -> 6364.42s]  this map. This map is complicated and confusing. I don't like it. It's good. You want to be you
[6364.42s -> 6376.76s]  want to catch them when they're on the top layer. What the hell? Adventure time is turning into a
[6376.76s -> 6400.14s]  horse. Oh, no. Wait, what the hell? No, no, no, no, no. Pulled together. We're good.
[6410.26s -> 6416.68s]  Oh, that was a good hit. Superman kind of messes me up, though, because like I'm Superman. So when
[6416.68s -> 6421.16s]  I say I got him, I got his ass. When I'm Superman and I see another Superman, it freaks me out a
[6421.16s -> 6427.00s]  little bit. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's weird seeing your own moves. Yeah. And he's got more
[6427.00s -> 6430.44s]  perks to me. He's a Superman with more perks to me. So that makes it worse. You know what I mean?
[6432.95s -> 6447.24s]  Oh, God, no. Oh, my God. I'm beating his ass. We're good. We're good. Wait, what? Oh, chill.
[6449.18s -> 6455.34s]  Well, I just flying off the screen. That was insane. I'm cracked. I'm cracked. I'm cracked
[6455.34s -> 6459.82s]  with it. I'm nice with it. I'm nice with it. I'm so nice with it. Oh, nasty. Nice. Oh, I died.
[6459.82s -> 6466.42s]  But it's OK. It's OK. We got more. I've got a better idea this time. I'm nasty. Nice with it.
[6467.14s -> 6481.58s]  This dog. Nice job. Nice job. Nice job. Wait, why is that not working? Zap.
[6481.58s -> 6492.84s]  Laser. Get laser, goblin. Get fucking laser, dude. No. Take a whack at it. Throw him down.
[6492.84s -> 6497.72s]  Nice. There it is. Nice. Game over. Oh, wait, it's not game over. One more. We got the advantage.
[6507.46s -> 6526.25s]  Get fucked. Get fucked. Oh, shit. No. Oh, shit. It's all right. We can attack the K. What does
[6526.25s -> 6531.45s]  that mean? Oh, don't do the same attack more than a few times in a row. You get a it decays the
[6531.45s -> 6545.30s]  damage it does. That was actually pretty sick if that knocked him off. But awesome. No, no, no.
[6545.30s -> 6552.84s]  He's behind me. Oh, he blew me up. Shit. It's all right. We're OK. Fully Jake. Get him. Jiggle him.
[6552.84s -> 6561.75s]  Jiggle peak. Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Oh, oh, my God. They're bouncing my ass.
[6562.55s -> 6574.82s]  That skateboard bullshit. Oh, that's it. It's game over. Nice. Nice job. Let's go.
[6578.41s -> 6584.82s]  Oh, my God. Toast and Lyric are ready. OK, how do we add them? Do you think we're ready?
[6584.82s -> 6589.94s]  Do you think we're ready for a 2v2? I think we could be ready for a 2v2, but we got to figure
[6589.94s -> 6597.58s]  out how to do it. OK, let's see. What's the what's the process here? Just add to party.
[6597.66s -> 6600.38s]  I just toasted them. They just toasted us. I don't know what that means, but.
[6602.89s -> 6611.21s]  Oh, that was you. You did pretty good damage. Your character. Whoa. Thank you. I have an invite.
[6611.21s -> 6616.17s]  Should I do this from disguised toast? Is that actually disguised toast or is it an imposter?
[6618.54s -> 6623.26s]  Wait, what is happening? Oh, I'm hitting control on my. Oh, God. Is this a fake?
[6624.38s -> 6629.93s]  Is this a fake or is this the right one? I don't know. Hold on. He said those made a game. Him
[6629.93s -> 6636.41s]  and I are in it. He's trying to add you guys. Oh, oh, wait, I found I found lyrics. Oh, I think
[6636.41s -> 6641.53s]  is it I think this is correct. I don't even know how to add people. Let me see. Let me see. I think
[6641.53s -> 6648.06s]  I can invite you. OK, I got to I got to confirm from disguised toast. I think that's him. All
[6648.06s -> 6654.07s]  right. I hope it's him. I hope it's him. Oh, yeah, this is this is it. This is true. This is
[6654.07s -> 6659.10s]  this is them. So we got it. We got to be ready here. I don't have any friends.
[6659.91s -> 6665.93s]  Once again, at the top of the hour, I'm going to run an ad or one minute outbreak here,
[6665.93s -> 6677.91s]  but also reminder that is an ad we are playing a video game that is our FTC requirement.
[6678.71s -> 6687.75s]  Thank you to Warner Bros. Interactive for sponsoring this stream. Your character and also
[6687.75s -> 6693.27s]  the open beta is July 26 on PlayStation, Xbox and PC with full cross play and full cross
[6693.27s -> 6697.85s]  progression. Everything that you unlock during this period will stick you with you with you all
[6697.85s -> 6703.77s]  the way through early access and open beta. Where you go? I did that joke a week ago. It's a good
[6703.77s -> 6715.29s]  joke. It's fine. All right. We joke. I was moving my lips. All right. Another player and I unlock
[6715.29s -> 6719.85s]  the reward. So we got we actually bring your game here because this is against other streamers.
[6720.57s -> 6723.85s]  Bro, they're going to beat our ass. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm pretty sure. I mean,
[6723.85s -> 6730.33s]  they're both sweaty as hell. They're sweat lords. So they're level nine. Dude, Lyric is already
[6730.33s -> 6735.61s]  level nine with his Batman, dude. That's fucking bullshit. I'll just say it. I'll go ahead and say
[6735.61s -> 6749.50s]  it. That's not cool. It's all right. We got it. All right. I got I got perks. I have no perks.
[6749.50s -> 6754.33s]  You're level eight with the Bugs Bunny. Yeah, that the fear of me having a skin,
[6754.89s -> 6758.09s]  I think is going to put some fear into their hearts. Yeah, me too. They're going to be like,
[6758.09s -> 6763.37s]  whoa, that's gold. Gold Superman, like unheard of, you know, that that sort of thing, I think
[6764.57s -> 6768.49s]  is what's going to happen. I'm very ready. Should we? Should we? Oh, shit, I should add them in a
[6768.49s -> 6773.85s]  Discord call to why did I not do that? Hold on. But we didn't want to hear the strategies, though.
[6774.49s -> 6785.78s]  No, no, it's fine. Let's go. I'm adding them. They're playing. Wait, are they playing? I'm not.
[6786.58s -> 6790.82s]  Why are we? Why are we? Why can nobody hit each other? What's going on? All right, we're good.
[6790.82s -> 6795.14s]  I don't know. I just added them into the Discord call, which is a tactic I was doing,
[6795.14s -> 6800.02s]  but they didn't fall for it, Jerma. The classic Discord call before the game tactic. But
[6800.82s -> 6803.62s]  I thought it was foolproof, but turns out it's not. You know what I mean?
[6805.86s -> 6808.10s]  I'm going to I'm just going to be quiet and play because I want to win.
[6808.82s -> 6817.18s]  I've got this. Why am I weakened? Why am I weakened? No, my bones are broken.
[6817.18s -> 6819.90s]  Batman broke my bones. Wait, what is he? He's always in a fucking.
[6820.94s -> 6827.22s]  Just stay out of that cloud. No, he's attacks are decayed. Wait. Oh, my God.
[6828.18s -> 6833.06s]  Oh, my God. Lyric is beating the doors off me, dude. I can't get him. He's a crack. He's a pro
[6833.06s -> 6851.86s]  gamer. Just kidding. Get fucked. Oh, dude, you're destroying this guy's toes. Trade, trade. Oh,
[6851.86s -> 6861.40s]  no, no. Sorry. Good. Good. Good. Wait, how am I healing? He's up. He's up. Yeah, let's go. Get
[6861.40s -> 6896.57s]  one. Get fucked. Oh, the collapsing route. That's two this time. No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh,
[6896.57s -> 6917.78s]  he body blocked me. Sure. You're not using. No, no. Oh, wait, how does he weaken me?
[6918.42s -> 6934.62s]  To be to hold together. I fucked up. I fucked up bad. No, I got stuck. You got it. It's fine.
[6934.62s -> 6940.06s]  Don't worry about it. We got this. Don't feel discouraged. You got this, King. No, no. Oh,
[6940.06s -> 6955.21s]  my God. I almost fall. Nice. Wait, what? Wait, what happened? How did I? I don't know what
[6955.21s -> 6961.93s]  happened. OK, well, they didn't add it. They didn't get on the call to my home. Did I stay
[6961.93s -> 6967.45s]  too high or something? I think, yeah, I think you were too much. I did the same thing, man.
[6967.45s -> 6972.41s]  OK, wait, tell them to chat. Tell them to turn on the discord or pick up the call. I called them.
[6975.78s -> 6983.16s]  We both got caught in the same exact spot. I think I think we got in the exact same spot.
[6984.22s -> 6991.58s]  Yo, yo, what's up, guys? What? I worked you. Oh, my God. After this, you can't even you can't
[6991.58s -> 6996.87s]  claim to be a gamer if you get worked by us. I don't know. I saw a victory screen on my.
[6996.87s -> 7001.35s]  I know. I just I mean, you got carried by Lyric. It's fine. It's not a big deal. Yo, what up?
[7001.35s -> 7006.15s]  What's going on? OK, this time it's for real. We were just like going easy on you guys. We're
[7006.87s -> 7010.87s]  professionals. You know what I mean? Oh, no, I feel you. OK, I was. Yeah, my control wasn't
[7010.87s -> 7016.39s]  plugged in. I got oil all over my hands. You did beat the doors off me, so I don't know how
[7016.39s -> 7023.43s]  that works, Lyric, but OK. Did I swear bug? I swear you like act me up and I just like tagged
[7023.43s -> 7030.63s]  you. I went flying up. You set me on an elevator. I don't know how you you guys have like hella
[7030.63s -> 7037.51s]  perks and stuff, right? I mean, I mean, I can take them off. I mean, they're like, OK, no, no, no,
[7037.51s -> 7040.71s]  keep them on. I think it's all right. It's good that you have the you need all the advantage.
[7041.67s -> 7045.99s]  You have a level three. Isn't that a level three perk? It's an X three. I don't know what you're
[7045.99s -> 7051.11s]  talking about. I keep perspiring out of my hands. I don't have any perks. It's just fine. OK,
[7051.11s -> 7055.67s]  you guys know everybody, right? Germa, everybody knows everybody. I think so. I know of Germa,
[7055.67s -> 7059.51s]  but first time playing same with you toast. No of you, but you know, don't be afraid.
[7060.79s -> 7065.43s]  Let's go for it. All right, let's see. Oh, I love this music. This is my favorite music.
[7066.39s -> 7078.28s]  This is like a Hercules one or something. It's the Steven Universe song. Oh, OK. Oh, yeah. Get
[7078.28s -> 7085.08s]  fucking destroyed. That's so much damage. I know. I love I love juggling with Batman. How do you
[7085.08s -> 7089.96s]  weaken? Do you know how that happens? I think just some attacks, depending on the character,
[7089.96s -> 7095.72s]  has weakened. My ex does weaken it every time I hit. What is the smoke cloud? Is that what is
[7095.72s -> 7101.24s]  that? If not cheating. I don't know what it does to you guys. I just you get. How do you
[7101.24s -> 7106.04s]  how do you how do you enable like that? I just need to have, you know, you know,
[7107.56s -> 7115.02s]  you're hacking, which is fine, I guess. But oh, shit. It's unlock it with the key they gave you.
[7115.82s -> 7120.94s]  Oh, the cheats. Yeah, I guess I missed it. Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. No, I didn't want to do it because I
[7120.94s -> 7126.86s]  didn't want to just try it so hard, says the guy with laser eyes. Yeah, well,
[7127.90s -> 7131.90s]  you're back. You're the only one in the game. Protect me. Protect me. I need a contraption
[7131.90s -> 7138.38s]  to fly. This is like a backyard turf. I think Wonder Woman can fly, too, no? Oh, can she?
[7139.74s -> 7146.14s]  I can show not in the game. So this is from Steven Universe. Yeah, the song is from Steven
[7146.14s -> 7150.22s]  Universe. I was thinking, like, where is the song from? And I just remembered it is from Steven
[7150.22s -> 7159.02s]  Universe. Oh, my God. I got that. Dude, this is so good when you juggle. It's like it's crazy. I
[7159.02s -> 7163.82s]  mean, when you when you get a string of combos, it's so stupid. Oh, like that. That was silly.
[7165.10s -> 7168.54s]  That's cheating, too. You have contraptions. That's literally cheating. Oh, it's a remix.
[7168.54s -> 7177.98s]  That's cool. It's a good dodge. That was a good dodge. No, get out of here. Oh, my God.
[7180.70s -> 7188.57s]  Where is she? Why are you blinking? I'm so mad. I'm so mad at you. I'm so mad at you. I'm so mad.
[7189.37s -> 7193.78s]  Oh, shit. Yeah. Where's your kryptonite now, dude? Huh? Where's your kryptonite?
[7196.98s -> 7205.21s]  Oh, God. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, shit. Watch your head. All right. You guys got to get out of here.
[7205.21s -> 7212.01s]  All right. Oh, no. Germa, avenge me. You're good. You're good. I don't know why I'm talking like
[7212.01s -> 7218.49s]  Batman. But hey, you know what a tactic means, right? It means you're using your spam. You're
[7219.13s -> 7225.05s]  a one hit Andy. Although you're talking to me, you're just screwing with my brain.
[7226.89s -> 7230.25s]  I thought you called me a one hit Andy. I was like, wait, why are you saying that you're my team?
[7231.29s -> 7238.70s]  Wait, I thought that was them. That was friendly fire. That was friendly fire.
[7240.38s -> 7245.58s]  I'm just glad there's no shaggy mains in this lobby. He's okay. Is he? Is he actually low?
[7250.38s -> 7255.66s]  I fell. I'm trying to do a cool thing and I didn't do a cool thing and instead I did an uncool thing.
[7266.09s -> 7269.37s]  Yeah, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. Watch me. Watch me resist it. Oh, shit.
[7270.49s -> 7294.28s]  Huckum, you got Mr. BC. Get the fuck out of here. Oh, God. What? How is that even possible?
[7295.40s -> 7308.58s]  How is that even possible? Oh, God. Toast. Get his ass. Get his ass. Get his ass. Oh, God.
[7309.14s -> 7325.26s]  Oh, come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't, I can't catch you. Oh, hit it. Oh, what? How did
[7325.26s -> 7334.42s]  you dodge that? Oh, my goodness. Got to be fast. Swan diving. Oh, my God. We can't do this. I don't
[7334.42s -> 7347.29s]  understand. Yeah. Get over here. Oh, shit. Dude, that was a launch. Oh, that's safe. All right.
[7347.45s -> 7352.33s]  We got Batman, Batman, Batman, Batman. Don't worry. We got this. We got this. I'm chilling.
[7352.33s -> 7363.77s]  I'm chilling. No, no, no, no. Shoot. That's bullshit. That was cheating, but it's fine.
[7366.09s -> 7369.77s]  It's all right. Good game. Dude, this game was actually a lot of fun.
[7370.73s -> 7376.81s]  We were chasing you around, Toast. You were slippery. Yeah. I wonder why we lost. And then
[7376.81s -> 7383.05s]  I look at how much damage I did, and it's 200. Hey, but you got the KOs. That's all that matters.
[7384.42s -> 7388.50s]  Just wait till the sweaty, really good players, they know how to use their supports
[7388.50s -> 7394.26s]  and just work together insanely. Oh, my God. It's going to be completely different.
[7394.26s -> 7397.94s]  Most of these characters just have those combo moves. It's going to be crazy.
[7399.37s -> 7404.25s]  People are not going to fall off the stage. I bet the dog is low-key one of the best supports
[7404.25s -> 7412.49s]  or something. Whoever that weird dog with the stars. With the pole, right? Yeah. The tutorial
[7412.49s -> 7417.37s]  dog. If you utilize that. The character has a team move. Choose your character. That helps
[7417.37s -> 7426.09s]  the partner. The dog has two of them. Should we switch up teams? I'm good this way. I'm good
[7426.09s -> 7429.37s]  this way. I don't mind. We're going to get a dub. We're going to get a dub. We're going to get a
[7429.37s -> 7436.01s]  dub. Wait, wait. You're not competent. You're not like you think. I'm so confident, dude.
[7436.01s -> 7442.49s]  Listen, you need to get lucky every game. He didn't even finish the tutorial. Oh, yeah. Oh,
[7442.49s -> 7447.61s]  no. No, I've been, but I've been, but we've been clapping cheeks nonstop. We actually have. This
[7447.61s -> 7455.21s]  is the tutorial. Yeah. Trial by fire. Trial by combat. No, I respect that. I do the same
[7455.21s -> 7459.61s]  shit. So you just got to throw yourself in and then figure it out when it's like,
[7460.57s -> 7467.13s]  you got to be in the midst. Have you guys tried the new, uh, iron giant character yet? Dude. Oh,
[7467.13s -> 7471.21s]  no, he got iron giant. He knows, he knows our strategies. He knows our strategies. He's good.
[7471.21s -> 7476.17s]  He's really good. I versed him. He's sick. He's massive. This guy was with stream sniping earlier.
[7476.17s -> 7483.13s]  I think what an iron giant was. No, I was using stream sniping in a game. We're all on the same
[7483.13s -> 7490.33s]  stage. No, I'm saying like he was stream sniping our earlier fights. How I was slapping people
[7490.33s -> 7496.89s]  with the iron giant. I should do that. Wait, can you do two of like, can you do Batman, Batman
[7496.89s -> 7501.05s]  or only one person per team? I think you can do whatever. Yeah. Do us whatever. I think you can
[7501.05s -> 7515.38s]  do as many as you want. You can have two V two all iron giants. Oh shit. God, he's so big. Oh my God.
[7516.26s -> 7521.46s]  Oh, iron giant literally like does not get hit. I mean, he doesn't, he doesn't take damage.
[7522.42s -> 7529.75s]  He's really good. Oh my God. Toast already incredibly tanky. Oh, what's the fuck,
[7530.47s -> 7536.47s]  dude? How do I keep getting weakened, dude? It's my hits. My hits. The first time I've ever like
[7536.47s -> 7542.07s]  gotten weakened, like you're, is it the cheats? Is that what it is? She's unlocked. It's the cheats
[7542.15s -> 7547.27s]  plus. I think Batman's just every move weekends. I think that's just like his thing. Yeah. Okay.
[7547.27s -> 7550.63s]  That's cheating. That's I got it. No, that's what I was wondering. You just like the sheets
[7550.63s -> 7557.27s]  unlocked. It's really heavy. Oh, come on. Like after this, I'll give you the file to extract
[7557.27s -> 7561.03s]  anywhere but your steam director. What is he doing? He's got bolts and shit. What is that?
[7566.25s -> 7573.85s]  Dude, they are beating the shit out of us. Oh my God. No, that's a double kill.
[7573.85s -> 7580.09s]  These are the platform. We did not just get double killed off the platform. Oh, we, oh, we did.
[7581.21s -> 7589.13s]  I'm so hurt. I'm so hurt. I'm going to hide behind the dude. He's huge. Oh shit. Wait,
[7589.13s -> 7594.97s]  what the fuck? Oh, be careful. Oh my God. We can't get four out. We can't get four out. It's on.
[7598.84s -> 7602.68s]  Yeah, this is all you toast. You're like a raid boss. All right, we got it. Never mind.
[7603.64s -> 7609.40s]  It doesn't matter. He's so powerful. That's why. That's why I said the iron meta. The iron giant
[7609.40s -> 7615.96s]  meta is crazy. Everybody knows this. Please don't season me. All right. I'm not food.
[7616.92s -> 7621.40s]  You turn into a turkey if I get enough on you. Only, only. Yeah. Only sweaty, sweaty boys.
[7621.40s -> 7629.37s]  You're the iron giant meta. Oh God. I was just going easy. Oh yeah. What the fuck? Wait, how?
[7629.77s -> 7635.05s]  Holy shit. I'm literally fucking body blocking you and you're just going up. You're tanking the hit.
[7638.74s -> 7651.70s]  Yeah. All you toast. I'll give you a smoke bomber. All right. All you. No, no. Get fucking fuck.
[7651.70s -> 7661.03s]  Get him. I'll move you over here. No. Wait, why can't I hit you? Hey, we can pull this back.
[7662.07s -> 7665.35s]  Do you have like a double health bar or something? What is that? Yeah, I can.
[7672.01s -> 7679.66s]  Oh, you're so heavy. Let's go get fucked. Oh, they're down here. They're down here. They're
[7679.66s -> 7687.91s]  down here. No, just punish, punish, punish, punish down. Downward moves, downward moves.
[7689.53s -> 7697.90s]  We're so screwed here. Dude, he's fucking, he's bouncing me. Oh God, he's bouncing me.
[7698.62s -> 7708.62s]  Ping pong ball. Oh, that's it. I had 180. That was close. Were you covered? Really well. And
[7708.62s -> 7713.02s]  that's what matters. It's almost like winning. Dude, this guy, he probably has like 500 damage.
[7715.26s -> 7723.82s]  All right. His hit box is so big. All right. Everybody go iron giant. We're going to do full
[7723.82s -> 7738.26s]  iron giant. Okay. 379 damage. That's insane. You guys got drops on? Yes, sir. Excellent. I
[7738.26s -> 7742.58s]  got to unlock it, man. I got to use the current. Yeah. Yeah. You got to use the coupon or whatever.
[7742.58s -> 7748.39s]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. The coupons are actually good. All right. All right. Oh, I don't have enough
[7748.39s -> 7753.43s]  polimium. No, no. Use the ticket. You have 30 tickets, right? No, no, no. I already have that.
[7753.43s -> 7757.91s]  I'm looking at the different variants, but I want to, I wanted to unlock the, uh,
[7759.98s -> 7762.86s]  Oh, the one, the last one's nice with the, with the shades.
[7763.98s -> 7767.90s]  How much is it? Wait, you have a different, oh, the beach giant, right? That's the one. Yeah.
[7767.90s -> 7773.34s]  The last guy. What did I spend all my points on? Donnie Avon team up. No, no, I can't, I can't
[7773.34s -> 7781.18s]  betray, uh, German for the clean boys. I don't have enough currency. The clean boy loyalty is
[7781.18s -> 7787.34s]  strong, man. Are you guys both, are you guys both beach bums? Oh, okay. Oh, no, I didn't unlock.
[7787.34s -> 7794.38s]  I'm saving a little of my currency. Can't take you to the grave, brother. Waste the way, spend away.
[7795.10s -> 7803.02s]  True, true. This is going to be actually pretty interesting. A bunch of nuts and bolts everywhere.
[7809.16s -> 7812.20s]  Out of all of us, toast knows exactly what he's doing. We don't, we're just going to be
[7812.20s -> 7816.12s]  pressing buttons. You got to guide the way. I mean, are you guys on keyboard or controller?
[7816.84s -> 7821.32s]  Controller. Are you playing keyboard? I'm playing keyboard. No, you're not.
[7822.12s -> 7825.88s]  Holy bro. What do you really do? Like toast literally is like unlocking shit that I didn't
[7825.88s -> 7831.08s]  even know existed. Like, I don't know how he's got like bolts on and shit. I'm already dead.
[7832.12s -> 7838.33s]  Who cares about the attack delay? Just do down, uh, down special. Oh, oh, okay. Oh,
[7838.33s -> 7850.36s]  this is actually kind of cool. Oh, that's so stupid. Get fucking destroyed. Oh my God.
[7855.88s -> 7861.78s]  I got confused. I thought I was toast. Yeah, no, that is a problem. That is definitely a problem.
[7862.90s -> 7871.70s]  Oh, you guys are both, are you guys both red? Yeah, that's very confusing. How'd you do the
[7871.70s -> 7874.26s]  missiles where I turned into like a terminator? What was that?
[7875.62s -> 7886.66s]  Wait, what am I doing? I don't know how I did that. What does that do? I can bolt you.
[7887.86s -> 7898.28s]  No, it's just the Rockham Sockham robots. What does this do? Oh, I couldn't even try it.
[7899.08s -> 7908.73s]  I swear you're like locked into one mode. Is this our move? Oh, come on. Oh my God.
[7908.73s -> 7915.69s]  Over the boot. You destroyed me, dude. Whoa. How are you going to blow up? What's happening?
[7917.43s -> 7920.39s]  I don't know. I just, they were in a green, uh, sphere. I don't know what that was.
[7925.75s -> 7932.01s]  How have I not fallen off yet? I think it's like his ammo. He can shoot out.
[7932.57s -> 7947.11s]  It's like, Oh, God damn it, dude. Oh, this is so dumb. Oh, come on. Come on. Are you fucking
[7947.11s -> 7955.19s]  kidding me? Oh my God. That's slam, bro. What was that scream? That was like somebody was pulling
[7955.19s -> 7960.07s]  teeth out of your mouth. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
[7960.07s -> 7965.35s]  feeding. I'm feeding. I don't like it. I'm sorry. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're okay.
[7965.35s -> 7971.46s]  We're okay. Bro. Toast is like literally fucking doing like, it's like playing it. Oh, come on.
[7972.66s -> 7976.94s]  It's like an entirely different game that Toast is playing than us. I think he's like,
[7977.50s -> 7980.78s]  I got like three fucking hits, three moves. Like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[7981.90s -> 7989.35s]  Protect friends. Oh God. He's glitch guarding me. Yeah. I'm going to suck him up. I'm going to suck
[7989.35s -> 8005.26s]  him up. All right. Attack. Why are we all in slow motion? You deal with him while I deal with Toast.
[8005.26s -> 8014.98s]  I deal with Toast. You deal with him. I'm going off the stage very quickly. What the fuck, dude?
[8014.98s -> 8024.28s]  That thing is what? Dude, that was an endless spam. I'm dead. No, no, no. You're good. You're
[8024.28s -> 8028.04s]  good. You're good. You're good. You're good. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm so dead. I died.
[8032.12s -> 8036.92s]  That is an unreasonable amount of stun lock. You definitely did like 700 damage.
[8036.92s -> 8043.24s]  You guys are just defected models. How much damage? Yeah. 556 damage. Are you kidding me?
[8046.17s -> 8050.17s]  All right. 1v3. All right. Toast, you're on your own team. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait,
[8050.17s -> 8056.81s]  can you even do 1v3s? No, I don't think so. Oh, let's see. We can do a free for all. Wait,
[8056.81s -> 8063.90s]  who left? Oh, that sounds fun. Wait, someone left. Auto party request cancel or something.
[8063.90s -> 8069.37s]  See, it says there. Yeah. Dude, you know what? I'm going to try. Everybody's in right now. Whatever
[8069.37s -> 8072.81s]  you want to do. I'm going to try Shaggy, dude. I think Shaggy is the only one who can stop.
[8075.61s -> 8081.13s]  You're trying to the dark side, man. Choose your character. I don't even know what Shaggy does, but
[8083.26s -> 8088.30s]  he's fast. He's like he's a brawler. So he's all about just like pure damage. I don't think he has
[8088.30s -> 8094.94s]  like a sandwich he throws. Everything else is like melee kicks, like all fighting brawler. Are you
[8094.94s -> 8101.66s]  still in Japan? Like, where are you right now, Toast? Yeah, I'm in Kyoto right now. Oh, damn.
[8102.70s -> 8109.74s]  Yeah, I'm screaming. What time is it over there? 9 a.m. So I started at 6 a.m.
[8110.70s -> 8116.70s]  Damn, yo, gamer. Dude, it is 6 a.m. Oh, wow. I wanted to potentially go to Korea,
[8116.70s -> 8119.42s]  but like I feel like the time zone difference is so severe.
[8121.26s -> 8129.48s]  Do you try and keep your schedule all the time? I try to do it in England. Wait, wait. Oh, you guys
[8129.48s -> 8134.52s]  are trying different characters. Okay, this is the time to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All level ones.
[8135.24s -> 8140.42s]  Man, nobody knows what's going on. Japan Ping is still winning. Yeah, no, Japan Ping is helping
[8140.42s -> 8145.86s]  him, actually. That's why he's still cracked. Yeah, is this hosting up a toast or is this
[8145.86s -> 8152.70s]  dedicated server? It doesn't feel laggy. I picked any server. Oh, you can choose? Okay.
[8153.58s -> 8159.50s]  So you're at the disadvantage or at the advantage. This game plays so well online. It really does.
[8160.62s -> 8165.02s]  Yeah, it's just that Japan Ping is helping him become unhittable. You know what I mean?
[8165.10s -> 8170.94s]  Oh, wait, we're doing like all free for all. Oh, okay. Any other video game? If you were
[8170.94s -> 8174.54s]  playing from Japan and we are in North America, we would be literally teleporting ground screen.
[8175.66s -> 8181.02s]  This is like actually crazy that we can play like this. Oh, come on, bro. German, German. Come on.
[8181.02s -> 8188.22s]  Don't hit me. Everybody hit, hit everybody. Hit this guy's toes. He's hiding. He's hiding in Japan.
[8188.70s -> 8198.44s]  Garnet. I'll beat you with a sandwich. Oh,
[8202.04s -> 8212.50s]  what are we doing here, mate? Like a little bit of RP. Oh, Chuck Scooby. Oh, no, I just fell off
[8212.50s -> 8218.50s]  the map. Hassan, do your best Tasmanian Devil. I don't know what the Tasmanian Devil sounds like.
[8218.50s -> 8226.01s]  What? Oh, I got that one. That was a dump for me.
[8226.65s -> 8242.10s]  Oh, wait, no, it wasn't. It wasn't. Oh, God. That actually wasn't bad. Yeah, it really wasn't.
[8242.74s -> 8273.80s]  What is this? Oh, Shaggy. Oh, Shaggy's fucking broken. I told you, man. No. Oh, shit. I lost
[8273.80s -> 8292.47s]  me. No. Oh, come on. Oh, no, Chuck Scooby. Why'd you do that to me? What was that? That was
[8292.47s -> 8296.07s]  that was a weird graphic. Harley Quinn's graphic just kind of jumped up. Was that you?
[8297.51s -> 8301.83s]  Harley Quinn? Yeah, I just saw there was like a Harley Quinn death screen. That was kind of cool.
[8302.95s -> 8310.97s]  Oh, shit. Oh, that was a huge health pack. I know.
[8311.53s -> 8323.75s]  Yeah. Time. What happened? Oh, Chuck Scooby. What happened?
[8325.03s -> 8332.95s]  Is the real villain was me all along. All right. All right. It's not Shaggy.
[8336.63s -> 8343.91s]  Let's go. Let's fucking go. Oh, here you go. Here's a dose for you. People are saying that's
[8343.91s -> 8353.32s]  Morty. No, Morty would be more like. Oh, that's Rick. That's Rick. Yeah. My favorite anime.
[8356.70s -> 8362.38s]  I can't believe we have fucking pro gamers in this lobby and the worst loser one. What the fuck?
[8362.38s -> 8367.50s]  Okay. Shaggy's. Hey, free for all. Literally free for all is just like the sneeze game mode.
[8367.50s -> 8372.62s]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Okay. Okay. I didn't realize it was like that. My bad. Okay.
[8372.62s -> 8382.68s]  I just want people to like me. Are we doing free for all again?
[8383.40s -> 8389.21s]  To be sure. Oh, to be to our to be to whatever. I think that's what. Yeah, let's go for it.
[8390.01s -> 8397.13s]  To be to mods. If you want to adjust your Gamba accordingly. Right. We got to win one of these
[8397.13s -> 8401.53s]  Hassan. We're getting kind of dunked on by. Yeah, no, I know. It's fucked up. It's because,
[8401.53s -> 8407.69s]  you know, Japanese ping and also cheating. So it's fine. I think. Okay. Says the guy whipping
[8407.69s -> 8416.97s]  out Shaggy. Oh, all right. Shaggy. Got a mirror. Not perks though. Don't worry.
[8417.61s -> 8422.73s]  Did none of us do. We're all level one. Oh, wait. Your Taz has the perk. Okay.
[8423.69s -> 8430.25s]  Turbo's rocking it. It's 5% increased damage. That's basically 20. Shaggy superpowers up the Zaza
[8430.25s -> 8437.42s]  is what people are saying. He's just super saying the Tasmanian devil is the most misunderstood
[8437.42s -> 8443.26s]  villain. He's not a villain. It's just like Looney Tunes are just weirdos. They're not bad.
[8443.26s -> 8448.46s]  Are they bad guys? Taz just wants to eat. He's just like a weird. He's a weird guy.
[8448.46s -> 8465.16s]  All right. Oh, Scooby. I'm off the Zaza. Oh, shit.
[8484.20s -> 8496.26s]  Come on season season. Oh, wait, what the fuck? Oh, shit. Hey, yo, one's almost a turkey.
[8497.22s -> 8509.86s]  No, don't turkey me. Oh, what just happened? That was bad. Wait, what the fuck? No.
[8512.58s -> 8516.58s]  What happened? That's such a dumb way to die. I hate that's the worst thing I hate about these
[8516.58s -> 8523.86s]  sorts of games is like you just like accidentally fucking get locked. Oh, I get stuck on the ledge
[8523.86s -> 8549.38s]  or whatever. Yeah, there we go. There we go. There we go. That kick. Bro, he's got the knee,
[8549.38s -> 8564.71s]  dude. Holy crap. Oh, sorry. Wrong game. Wait, what? What just happened? How? Oh, you guys got
[8564.71s -> 8572.74s]  Tasmanian devil. Yeah, dude. Taz is crazy, dude. I'm feeling okay. Okay, we got this next round.
[8572.74s -> 8578.90s]  It's a wrap. It's a pepperoni pepperoni round. Thanks for the carry. You did double my damage.
[8578.90s -> 8586.94s]  I got annihilated. That was teamwork, man. Oh, we got. Okay. I'm going back to the main
[8590.23s -> 8598.95s]  main character. Oh, you're going main. Okay. Okay. All right. By the way, at the half hour
[8598.95s -> 8605.51s]  mark, once every 30 minutes, we have to remind everyone that thank you Warner Bros for interact
[8605.51s -> 8611.59s]  Warner Bros interactive for sponsoring this stream. Wow. Thank you for doing that for us.

[8632.33s -> 8637.74s]  have we been playing this game for? I feel like I'm playing like four hours. This game's fun.
[8637.74s -> 8642.54s]  It flies by, man. It's like, you know, yeah, no, this is, this is like one of the most breezy
[8642.54s -> 8649.21s]  hashtag ads I've done. Actually, it taps into your childhood. Like, come on now. I can't wait for
[8649.21s -> 8656.09s]  some of the new characters. Prepare yourself. Warner Brothers has so much. Oh, they can pull.
[8656.09s -> 8661.13s]  Oh my God. There's so many. They say who they're going to do or anything. Or I think they just
[8661.13s -> 8667.13s]  kind of leaving it up in the air. But I'm very excited. They have so many cool characters.
[8667.13s -> 8670.25s]  Are you guys going to play again on the 26th? I'm going to play again on the 26th, I think,
[8670.25s -> 8673.53s]  or 26th or whenever it is. Yeah, we should group up again or something.
[8675.05s -> 8679.18s]  Oh yeah, they should add Gandalf. Yeah, lyrics like lyrics like, yeah, let's group up again
[8679.18s -> 8684.70s]  so I can beat your asses with ease. This is a lot of this is like me and German,
[8684.70s -> 8689.34s]  like beating the crap out of 11 year olds earlier. Hey, come on. They were 12.
[8692.22s -> 8695.18s]  Did you guys get did you guys get weirded out by the age thing too? It's like,
[8695.98s -> 8702.62s]  are you below 10 or like, are you below 10 or 20 plus? It's like, well, OK, I'm 22 plus.
[8703.18s -> 8714.82s]  Yeah, that was definitely like a weird range. Hey, hey, hey, what the fuck? What happened?
[8717.22s -> 8724.34s]  I saw you like lose track or something. My controller just unplugged. Oh, never mind.
[8724.58s -> 8731.14s]  Oh, no, German. No, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine that your controller's unplugged.
[8731.14s -> 8735.82s]  We still got this. My guy just ran off the screen. It's the last action I did.
[8738.89s -> 8764.25s]  Oh, my goodness. Wait, what? It's tied up. Wait, what? I can't tell if that's your fog
[8764.25s -> 8770.09s]  or if this is the game fog. No, this is the level fog level fog. Mine's like more white.
[8774.36s -> 8780.04s]  What? You just ate me. Oh, what the fuck was that? Bro, you got so many moves. Like,
[8780.04s -> 8785.21s]  I have no idea what's going on at the time. He's made out of like clay or something.
[8787.14s -> 8794.74s]  I don't know the lore behind Adventure Time like that. All right. Good. Oh, no. I'm failing.
[8796.10s -> 8798.26s]  Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.
[8798.26s -> 8803.22s]  He's a weak link. He's a weak link. Get away from him. No, I'm the weak link.
[8803.78s -> 8817.99s]  Oh, my goodness. Oh, God. Don't pull off. Don't pull off. How are you doing that? How are you
[8817.99s -> 8823.99s]  doing that? Just crush him with the fucking iron.
[8833.11s -> 8841.27s]  Oh, excuse me. That was fucking fake. What happened? I did a clip in like 0.25 speed.
[8841.27s -> 8845.67s]  What was that? I don't even know what happened. What happened? Did we lose?
[8848.55s -> 8856.22s]  What actually happened? I saw toast fall, you falling and then toast back on the main stage
[8856.22s -> 8861.42s]  and then we won. Yeah. What was that? Was that like, okay, that was unironically Japanese ping,
[8861.42s -> 8870.31s]  I think. I saw myself winning. You guys saw that, right? Like I saw me kicking toast off.
[8871.19s -> 8877.03s]  No. I have no idea what happened. It was fun, though. Whatever it was.
[8877.83s -> 8882.39s]  Yo, guys. GGs, though. I'm going to chill here. Yo, I'm down to play if you guys are on another
[8882.39s -> 8887.91s]  time or something. Yeah, good play. Until next time. Nice meeting you guys. GGs. Have a good one.
[8887.91s -> 8892.55s]  Yeah, good game. This was wonderful. Once again, thank you, Lyric. Have a good one. By the way,
[8892.55s -> 8897.19s]  guys, they're doing multiverses. Make sure you experience more multiverses on their channel.
[8898.07s -> 8904.52s]  That's right. Who else is still staying? Who's still playing? I'm good for a little while.
[8905.24s -> 8912.50s]  I love this game. I'll keep playing. We can't do like, we do 2v1, give toast a chance to.
[8913.14s -> 8919.38s]  No, I'm not that good. Bro, what do you mean? You're cracked, bro. You got 300 damage. What
[8919.38s -> 8927.00s]  the fuck is going on right now? I played during the last beta. Wait, really? There was another beta?
[8927.00s -> 8933.59s]  Yeah, there was. Yeah, there was the early alpha. Oh, wait. Play with moist critical. Is he playing?
[8934.31s -> 8941.43s]  Oh, Charlie is like insane. Is he cracked out? Yeah, he has like at least 100 hours.
[8942.39s -> 8949.37s]  Okay. I don't even know how. This game is not even out yet. Let me see. Is he live right now?
[8949.37s -> 8955.45s]  Is he in? I'm going to add him to the call. I mean, he owns a Smash team. So, right. Or not a
[8955.45s -> 8962.81s]  Smash team. He owns a Rocket League team, right? He's an e-sports gamer. So what's what's his
[8962.81s -> 8969.05s]  online? What's his plan? Play with Ludwig? No, I'm not going to play with Ludwig because I fucking
[8969.69s -> 8975.69s]  text. I sent him a text message saying, do you want to play? Do you want to play multiverses?
[8975.69s -> 8981.80s]  And he did not respond to me. Oh, moist and letter playing. All right. Okay. Nevermind.
[8981.80s -> 8986.12s]  Now I'm going to step out and do some solo practice and you guys take the 2v2.
[8986.12s -> 8990.62s]  Okay. Very good. It was good to play with you though.
[8990.62s -> 8995.90s]  Yeah. GG's guys. All right. GG's. Jeremy, do you want to keep playing?
[8995.90s -> 9005.50s]  Yeah, I'm good to play. Let's do it. What up? How's it going? Oh, shit. Wait, did you add?
[9005.50s -> 9009.10s]  Wait, no, don't add Ludwig to the group, dude. Don't do that. What are you talking about? Why?
[9009.10s -> 9014.38s]  I hate that guy. Why? What's wrong with you? I'm kidding, man. What are you talking about?
[9014.38s -> 9017.74s]  Thanks for responding to my text message asking you to play video games together.
[9017.90s -> 9022.57s]  It's not a big deal, but hey, here to play against you two. Hassan, I'm sorry. I just
[9022.57s -> 9025.86s]  didn't think it was real. I thought you were hacked. Wait, what do you mean?
[9026.82s -> 9031.62s]  I just couldn't believe that you were playing a video game. Hey, how is not having drops on
[9031.62s -> 9037.70s]  YouTube? Is that cool? You don't speak to my teammate that way. How's that?
[9038.98s -> 9043.46s]  In the fucking ring, bro. No, no, no, no, no, no shot. You're like a fucking sweaty
[9043.46s -> 9048.34s]  smash player. And so is Charlie. We have to separate the teams. Hassan Hassan.
[9048.34s -> 9052.98s]  This is not smash. This is multiverses, by the way. I know. But like, you know,
[9052.98s -> 9056.66s]  they're different games is what you didn't recognize that Jerma did. Idiot.
[9057.38s -> 9063.78s]  Okay. By the way, we got my Bugs Bunny. I've been working. I want to free for all actually
[9063.78s -> 9069.61s]  against all of these pros. So I've never played the game and I'm playing on keyboard mouse.
[9069.61s -> 9077.13s]  Just play us in in in stuck it up. Do I do I have can I do it? How do we invite people?
[9077.13s -> 9080.81s]  Oh, yeah. Would you write your usernames in there so I can invite you?
[9080.81s -> 9085.53s]  My username is air coots 31. Okay, just write it because I don't know how to spell.
[9085.53s -> 9092.18s]  Nobody add me except for Hassan in Jerma. Okay, I have no idea how to.
[9092.18s -> 9099.77s]  It's air A.I.R. Okay, I'm just adding voice. Oh, T.S. Oh, wait, we can do it off steam. I think
[9100.01s -> 9106.42s]  it has to be WB name. Yeah, you have to be in game and give WB just one more time.
[9106.42s -> 9112.79s]  Those air coots 31. No, I'm searching. I'm searching moist and adding him.
[9112.79s -> 9119.90s]  I well, I don't know why everything you do is offensive, but it is moist. I sent you a request.
[9119.90s -> 9124.50s]  All right. Are we doing free for all? Are we doing to be too? No, we're doing to be too.
[9126.66s -> 9130.95s]  What do you guys means? Shaggy Shaggy. Oh, I'm Shaggy. Oh, what?
[9131.67s -> 9136.95s]  Oh, no. No, we're going to get so we're going to get three Shaggy players here.
[9136.95s -> 9142.57s]  Three Shaggy players. I'll switch. I'll switch. Who's your second? Okay. Okay. Okay. I am going
[9142.57s -> 9150.42s]  to add moist to the lobby. I'm doing it. I'm adding moist to lobby. You moisture. You got a request.
[9151.46s -> 9156.66s]  I'm coming. And then I'll bring in Ludwig. Okay. Oh, actually, he came with me. Are we both here?
[9157.30s -> 9166.57s]  No, I'm not seeing him. Add me. Oh, you're right. Okay, I got him. You should play as the WB frog.
[9166.57s -> 9169.69s]  All right. The second day, the second they add that, that's my main for the rest of my life.
[9170.25s -> 9177.56s]  Actually, a great main air coots 31. Shocker. Was it hard to spell? Come on.
[9178.36s -> 9182.47s]  I don't know what you meant when you said air coots. I thought it was like,
[9182.47s -> 9187.27s]  like E R K U T. Like, I don't know. It could be so many different ways. I don't know what the
[9187.27s -> 9193.11s]  fuck air coots is. I don't know why you make things difficult. I'm sorry. I did not realize
[9193.11s -> 9203.56s]  that you, you know, have a named it after your cat, which was also once on mogul money.
[9203.56s -> 9206.92s]  Dude, I know what I want to drink, like a like a 32 ounce Gatorade right now.
[9207.88s -> 9214.92s]  Okay, let's do it. So bad. Let's are we are we ready to go? And I'm talking about the gross
[9214.92s -> 9219.00s]  orange one. You know what I mean? Am I the one who, am I the one who's controlling?
[9219.00s -> 9223.00s]  Am I the one who's controlling the lobby? No, no, no. Jermez Jermez. Oh shit. Okay.
[9223.00s -> 9227.05s]  Are we good with this, this format? Yeah, this works. This will work. All right, cool. Let's
[9227.05s -> 9237.11s]  just do it. I used to, after soccer practice, suck down a Snapple in about three seconds. Oh
[9237.11s -> 9244.09s]  God. That's big. That's awesome. What kind of Snapple? What kind of Snapple? Yeah, there's
[9244.09s -> 9251.00s]  like 500 flavors. Wait, there's like a, there's like a main one. There's like the Snapple,
[9252.36s -> 9259.53s]  like Apple. Is it, is that it? There's like a main, like the original Snapple. I always thought
[9259.53s -> 9266.97s]  that it was kind of like, it was 12, 20 different flavors. I think there are, but like, it's like,
[9267.93s -> 9273.83s]  I think there are, but I think there's a main one. Is it peach? I think it is Apple, right? It's
[9273.83s -> 9279.27s]  in the name, isn't it? Wait, we have odds in the chat right now. Will Lassan and Jermez win? No has
[9279.27s -> 9285.43s]  9 million points and yes has 1 million or 10 million points now. I will, I'd like it to be
[9285.43s -> 9290.63s]  known in the, the alpha for this. I was ranked 1000 in the top thousand across the whole game.
[9290.63s -> 9296.71s]  I am, I am going to shut my fucking mouth and try as hard as I can. Oh, I'm sweating. I'm,
[9296.71s -> 9302.39s]  I'm actually out here to prove a point. Don't embarrass me. Don't, don't embarrass me in front
[9302.39s -> 9308.31s]  of, in front of Jermez. I'm in here with a bad attitude and something to prove. So I'm coming
[9308.31s -> 9313.99s]  at you hot. Why dude? Come on. I'm not a gamer. I have never played and I'm on keyboard mouse.
[9313.99s -> 9322.49s]  So I'm not feeling particularly, um, confident. We're going to get forward. No, no, no. If we get
[9322.49s -> 9333.45s]  one kill, it's a wait, he's already sandwiching it. I don't even know how that happened. I just
[9333.45s -> 9346.31s]  got intimidated. Yeah, I'll do that to you. That's my hidden passive. Your other hidden passive is
[9346.31s -> 9352.07s]  like looking like me and my boomer brain doesn't comprehend that. You know what I mean? God damn
[9352.07s -> 9360.57s]  right. It's my camouflage. I'm just going to chill here for a while. You got this. Whoa,
[9360.65s -> 9378.62s]  God damn it. How does that not kill you? How does that not kill you? I just dodged.
[9378.62s -> 9386.30s]  Are you guys going to do this again on the 25th or 26th? Yep. 20. Yeah. Yeah. 26. Okay. Well,
[9387.48s -> 9392.28s]  we better start by then. By then I'll practice and get so much better. Wait, can we? Oh no.
[9396.02s -> 9401.78s]  Germa is so slippery. It's nuts. I just, I'm tossing us on like a rag doll.
[9402.74s -> 9414.50s]  Yeah. It's because I can't hit women. That's why I just. Oh my balloons. Oh my gosh. Get the
[9414.50s -> 9430.74s]  double, get the double, get the double. Germa's nuts. Fuck. No. My God. What are you doing? What
[9430.74s -> 9435.78s]  is that even doing? Oh, Germa. He was fucking with my brain. He was fucking with my brain.
[9435.78s -> 9445.30s]  We're in a good spot here though. Oh shit. I thought I'd make things a little spicy.
[9446.66s -> 9468.89s]  Good news. The fuse is lit. Oh, that's safe. Shaggy. I love that safe. It's so fun. Come on.
[9468.89s -> 9481.27s]  Oh my God. My tactic almost played off. What? Yo, we're good. We're good. There was no problem.
[9481.99s -> 9487.59s]  Oh, I jumped away. Oh, that was so clutch. Oh my God. I was fucking. Oh my God. I was looking at
[9487.59s -> 9496.23s]  moist. What the fuck? I'm sorry, Germa. That's too fucking. Okay. Okay. I died twice for no
[9496.23s -> 9502.07s]  fucking reason. I died twice for no fucking reason. Still got more damage than Eric Coot's over there.
[9502.07s -> 9506.63s]  Why does it say I got the least damage? I was wondering that. Is that? It's a known bug, known
[9506.63s -> 9511.19s]  bug. Okay. That makes sense. Oh, is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's crazy. Oh,
[9511.19s -> 9517.43s]  yeah. That's something with the mouse. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. Because when you left
[9517.43s -> 9521.75s]  click, the inputs are a little off. The known bug is just being bad at playing games. I'm playing
[9521.75s -> 9529.35s]  Batman my main now. Prepare for my dectifying exit. My boy. Hey, you still good on Shaggy or
[9529.35s -> 9536.09s]  you're going to walk off the stage another three times? Oh, come on, dude. Come on. See the guys,
[9536.09s -> 9539.37s]  we had something great. Okay. You know what? I'm going to go with iron giant. Fuck it.
[9542.30s -> 9548.38s]  I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. He's not. You are bad and you should quit. Yeah. I know I'm bad.
[9548.38s -> 9554.14s]  I know I'm bad. Okay. I'm very upset about it. You know, going normie shit. Germa's very competitive
[9554.14s -> 9558.22s]  and you don't recognize it. I do recognize it. I've been, I've been trying to impress him this
[9558.22s -> 9562.22s]  entire time. Like I've literally, that's the only reason I was doing all right. I'll be really
[9562.22s -> 9566.54s]  completely upfront. You said you, can I go back? I want to try Superman again.
[9568.30s -> 9575.74s]  We can't go back. I don't have any perks. He didn't even do the tutorial and we dug down.
[9576.94s -> 9581.74s]  He's been playing actually really well to be honest. Thank you. Is that who you've fought
[9581.74s -> 9586.54s]  before? Yeah. But toast was actually kind of cracked and also Japanese bank saved him twice.
[9587.58s -> 9592.50s]  Okay. One time it definitely saved them. Like that's not even a joke. Like we beat his ass and
[9592.50s -> 9599.62s]  then the game just delivered him the w for no reason. Was that a frog? What the hell was that?
[9599.62s -> 9605.85s]  No, it's just what I thought of that statement to be honest. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. All
[9605.85s -> 9610.09s]  right. Let's pull it together. Okay. I have no, I have no dog in this. I have no state. Okay. I'm
[9610.09s -> 9626.23s]  not good. I know I'm not good. Oh my God. I'm not letting you up. Excuse me. Wait, why am I not able
[9626.23s -> 9634.71s]  to hit you? That makes no sense. Good grab. You said fire giant. I hit the iron one. I said fire
[9634.71s -> 9654.74s]  giant. Whoa. Ooh, easy. That was nasty. The thing about me is I do nasty things. Nice. Well, that
[9654.74s -> 9676.17s]  was nice. Shit. Oh, what the fuck? Oh God. If you were like one second sooner, Jerma, I was dead.
[9677.93s -> 9691.30s]  I killed you to be honest. Me? Yeah. No. No, I was weak when you threw me and you were in range.
[9691.78s -> 9702.78s]  Honestly, the whole time. Yikes. Oh, come on. I was on the screen still. Yeah. How do you like that?
[9702.78s -> 9708.86s]  The taste of defeat? I mean, we just need to work on Ludd's recovery. I think it will be golden.
[9708.86s -> 9712.62s]  I don't even know what that means. Someone in the chat was saying that to me and I have no idea what
[9712.62s -> 9721.10s]  those words mean. Oh my God. I killed you. I'm so sorry. I don't know how to explain that.
[9721.10s -> 9726.14s]  Is that what happened? Yeah. And you didn't move and it killed you. You had like 50 seconds to
[9726.14s -> 9732.78s]  walk forward. That was so funny. I don't even know what that was. I was just like flying.
[9733.34s -> 9738.55s]  You were in slow motion. Dude, that was slow motion, man. That was so funny.
[9739.43s -> 9756.28s]  The joint! The iron joint! The iron joint's got me! There we go. Wait, what? How did that? Oh,
[9756.28s -> 9763.75s]  shit! What happened to you at the end? We needed that. No match-up knowledge doesn't
[9763.75s -> 9769.03s]  gain plus ratio. Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing. I might say most damage to me. Dude, I
[9769.03s -> 9773.27s]  didn't do any damage. It looks like the glitch got fixed because I'm not last this time by a
[9773.27s -> 9779.75s]  point. Oh, that's crazy that you outdid. You outdid yourself by one damage. It usually lasts for
[9779.75s -> 9783.35s]  like one game lead, so it should be fine now, I think. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. I think you
[9783.35s -> 9786.71s]  infected my computer, by the way. Like it's not, it's kind of annoying. It does feel like that.
[9789.56s -> 9793.96s]  I have, you guys have cleaned out the believers. Okay. They're done. They do not believe in me any
[9793.96s -> 9800.12s]  longer. Are you happy? No, no, I'm not. That doesn't make me feel good. Okay, good. Then go
[9800.12s -> 9803.88s]  easy on me this round. Okay. All right, I'm playing. Oh wait, do I have enough for Finn?
[9805.72s -> 9812.86s]  The street still believe in you, I can confirm. Thank God. I should play Jake. Would I like Jake?
[9813.94s -> 9817.94s]  Jake's pretty cool. Jake used to be kind of busted in the tech test. I don't know if he still is.
[9817.94s -> 9826.47s]  What's Jake? From adventure. You don't know Adventure Time? Oh, okay. Dude, that you riding
[9826.47s -> 9832.44s]  the rocket up to death is replaying in my head over and over again. I'm going to be thinking
[9832.44s -> 9837.24s]  about that like all night. That was kind of traumatic to witness. I'm not going to lie.
[9837.24s -> 9843.50s]  It just hurt my feelings and he wasn't even on my team. He's just going, what's happening?
[9843.50s -> 9848.54s]  What's happening? It's just floating up to death. Yeah. You, I mean, you cooked me, but it's all good.
[9850.62s -> 9853.66s]  They need all the advantage that you get. You know what I'm saying? Like we got it.
[9854.30s -> 9860.65s]  Hey, you, you are golden Superman at this point, so we're good. These have been close games. I mean,
[9861.21s -> 9866.44s]  we were on last stock. All right. This is, we're playing for real now. Let's do it.
[9867.08s -> 9872.84s]  Yeah. Yeah. No, no. The training, the training wheels are off. I'm, I'm, you know, pulling on,
[9872.84s -> 9886.95s]  I'm taking out the weights, the sandbags. This is the good song. Yeah, this is the good song.
[9886.95s -> 9901.24s]  I love the song. Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Oh my God. I'm getting absolutely slammed and jammed
[9901.24s -> 9916.38s]  over here. My bombs already. I'm a better superhero than Batman. No, you're not. What are these
[9916.38s -> 9930.12s]  coins? Oh shit. Oh, I'm weakening the pootie out of these two. Holy. What's my finisher? Like,
[9930.12s -> 9937.32s]  how do you do a finisher? I, I think it's only for certain players. Yeah. Some people actually have
[9937.32s -> 9953.69s]  one. What the fuck, dude? It's called the tornado. I'm enraged. Yeah. Oh, you snuck away. You snuck by
[9953.69s -> 9967.03s]  that. God damn right. Maybe my recovery is nasty. Recover this. I'll never find me here.
[9967.75s -> 9982.70s]  Oh, he found me. Wait, how? That's fucking me. That was me. Spacing, bro.
[9983.82s -> 9989.75s]  Having a hard time. I'm not going to lie. It doesn't feel as good as he did back in the alpha.
[9989.75s -> 10000.39s]  Get him in the sandwich. I'm not sure. Oh, how did I miss? I'm warming up the fin.
[10001.75s -> 10004.71s]  Wait, what? How does that even happen? I don't understand.
[10005.67s -> 10009.91s]  Like when I'm, when I'm flying towards you with an attack, how does that not work?
[10015.42s -> 10020.30s]  I don't know what spacing means. You have a certain distance that your moves travel
[10020.30s -> 10027.98s]  and you're doing it too far away. How about that? Did I travel well? I'm starting to lag a little
[10027.98s -> 10037.35s]  bit. Oh, come on, Gwyn. No, no. How is he still alive? I don't know in my, in my up airs.
[10039.19s -> 10047.45s]  It's been absolutely got here. Okay, German killed himself. My controller.
[10054.65s -> 10057.69s]  Hey, what are coming? Gifted subs are coming. Hey, we appreciate that.
[10058.25s -> 10069.21s]  Fucking. Dude, blame the USB mini standard. Okay. The USB standard. I will keep it a stack.
[10069.21s -> 10077.93s]  Hassan. It was just superhero gap. Yeah. Oh, oh, you were worse today.
[10083.06s -> 10088.42s]  Only an amateur blames his tools as they say. Dude, only, only a professional. I don't know
[10088.42s -> 10095.70s]  what happened. I am. I blame my fucking tools. That's how you did. Great. Believe in yourself.
[10095.70s -> 10102.26s]  The USB micro standard. The thing is like a toothpick that sticks in it. No, it it's unbelievable.
[10103.14s -> 10106.42s]  My controller unplugged itself and I walked off twice.
[10109.64s -> 10112.28s]  It's just better tactics. I think is what it boils down to.
[10113.00s -> 10126.18s]  Oh crap. Crap. By the way, July 26th open beta begins. If you have drops. Good call.
[10126.18s -> 10132.92s]  Also, thank you. Warner Brothers for sponsoring this stream. Absolutely. Damn.
[10132.92s -> 10139.16s]  Lud, you're not even saying that ever, dude. What's going on? He's muted right now. I don't know.
[10139.16s -> 10143.24s]  He's focusing. He's muted. I think he's probably saying that right now. That's why.
[10143.48s -> 10149.51s]  No, actually cool though. Cross progression, cross play, cross everything. That's cool.
[10149.51s -> 10154.55s]  Boys, the plan is simple. We're going to beat the doors off of Ludwig today.
[10155.27s -> 10160.52s]  Now, let's get in the hang of it now. Just give him. He just needed like four matches to warm up.
[10160.52s -> 10164.60s]  Now he's going to go nuts. If I walk off the edge one more time, I'm going to eat this controller.
[10167.08s -> 10179.77s]  Oh, I can't believe I still hit Jerma. You make me sick.
[10179.85s -> 10191.50s]  You make me sick. Dude, just wait till they add Daffy Duck. What are these gold coins doing?
[10192.84s -> 10199.48s]  Is that your character? Is that Jay? Oh, what? Wait, did Jerma die again? My controller. USB
[10199.48s -> 10216.71s]  standard. USB mini standard. We take that. Oh my God. You just styled on me. That was kind of big.
[10216.71s -> 10232.81s]  Yeah. I got you with a nasty combo. Oh, you just repeat it. I thought you were going to grab the
[10232.81s -> 10243.90s]  edge. Your spacing is trash, right? Your spacing is trash. No, don't make me do this. Oh, they have
[10243.90s -> 10248.62s]  specific voice lines against each other. Oh, and it was disgusting what you just did to me. Oh,
[10248.62s -> 10253.58s]  it was disgusting. It was disgusting. I chased it down, baby. This is a blowout and I hate it.
[10256.38s -> 10261.34s]  If Jerma's controller wasn't broken, you guys would be so dead. Not even funny. It would be
[10261.34s -> 10266.46s]  sad how badly we'd be beating you. I'll keep it a stack. If Charlie teamed with Jerma,
[10266.46s -> 10271.42s]  you would still lose. Wait, really? Oh, well, yeah, you are the worst player on the map.
[10274.06s -> 10281.94s]  And Charlie is the best. No, you. Good response, bro. You're bad.
[10283.88s -> 10287.82s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. I'm coming. Oh, God.
[10288.70s -> 10297.37s]  What the fuck did I throw off the cliff for? Oh, I almost had you red. Oh, yeah, I'm terrified.
[10297.37s -> 10302.97s]  I'm actually terrified of you right now because I don't want to lose the game. Oh, my. What? Wait,
[10302.97s -> 10308.81s]  what? Why did I fall off? I fucking melted you, bro. No, you didn't. Jerma died. That's the same
[10308.81s -> 10313.21s]  thing. It doesn't matter. You were fucking trash. Let's look at your damage. Look at your damage.
[10315.61s -> 10321.85s]  It's better than you. It's better than you. No, it's worse than the wood. I crushed you, bro.
[10321.85s -> 10328.57s]  I'm getting super glue and I'm super glue in this USB micro. 381 damage every more than all of us
[10328.57s -> 10335.21s]  combined. Gorilla. This is my shit. I'm just kind of nasty at these kind of games. I'm not going to
[10335.21s -> 10342.81s]  lie. OK, OK, OK. What do we let's do one more. One more to be to. We've got to try to pull this back.
[10344.52s -> 10347.56s]  All right. One more to be to one more to be. Then we can try some frieze. Sounds good.
[10348.12s -> 10355.70s]  I'm going to accidentally gorilla glue my hands to this controller. At some point, I have to one
[10355.70s -> 10361.06s]  of you when you has on. Why is my dude? I'm so down. I mean, you're going to be on the keyboard,
[10361.06s -> 10383.59s]  right? Yeah. OK, good. I think I'm going to change it up here. Oh, man. This is a bold move. I think
[10383.59s -> 10388.31s]  it's I think so. We're playing as the we get 20 percent more damage if we play with the same
[10388.31s -> 10395.59s]  characters from the same universe. Oh, you're playing as Jake? Yeah. Oh, that'll boy. Jake's
[10395.59s -> 10400.71s]  good. I was just trying to mess with you. I'm not playing with Jake. Oh, you just like what you told
[10400.71s -> 10405.83s]  a lie. We're playing with the mystery machine group. Oh, it's kind of fucked up, though, to lie.
[10405.83s -> 10411.77s]  Oh, my God. OK, I was I'm a liar. I thought it was friendly art of war.
[10413.46s -> 10418.50s]  You guys know why my when I all tab it state it's like sticks.
[10420.55s -> 10423.19s]  Oh, are you and when you are you in windowed full screen?
[10424.73s -> 10429.45s]  No, when I all tab it just like shows the all the fucking instead of like showing it for a
[10429.45s -> 10435.34s]  second for the duration of the all tab it just like it just has all of my programs right there
[10436.54s -> 10442.58s]  on screen. Are you playing in full screen mode or windowed mode? I think I'm playing on.
[10443.38s -> 10449.56s]  Never mind. It's fine. We'll figure it out. All right. See if we can pull this out here.
[10450.68s -> 10455.96s]  Oh, this is a good map. I hate this map. You press windows tab instead of all that.
[10456.68s -> 10476.76s]  What's the tech button? Is it just watch? Yeah, it's dodge. Oh, man, German slippery.
[10476.76s -> 10484.58s]  He's amazing. I'm ashamed. Who is the development? The Shaggy shit. Shaggy shit. Oh, that's really.
[10484.58s -> 10488.58s]  That's weird. Who are you talking about? You say who's amazing on the Shaggy shit.
[10488.58s -> 10491.54s]  That's crazy because you thought it was German and you were complimenting Shaggy.
[10491.54s -> 10494.34s]  And now you realize it's me. No, I think it's really bad.
[10496.58s -> 10498.34s]  That's so weird that you feel that way because.
[10498.74s -> 10507.90s]  Oh, my God. Guys, clip that clip that Ludwig professional Smash Bros player
[10507.90s -> 10527.18s]  said that I was amazing on Shaggy. I'll take it. Oh, come on. Oh, how did you survive that?
[10527.82s -> 10533.18s]  I don't know. I'm not going to lie at that for sure. I was dead. How is she dodging everything?
[10533.34s -> 10534.06s]  The double kill.
[10541.10s -> 10542.46s]  Getting double sucked.
[10545.82s -> 10551.26s]  It's not canon. They don't say that. The show. They do. They do, dude.
[10552.46s -> 10556.38s]  Are we just OP because we're playing canonical characters like literally tie
[10556.38s -> 10559.50s]  20% more damage, dude. They don't know that same universe.
[10559.50s -> 10564.55s]  There's nobody in the Batman universe here.
[10564.55s -> 10567.58s]  Superman?
[10567.58s -> 10569.14s]  Yeah, they're in the same universe.
[10569.14s -> 10570.16s]  Are they?
[10570.16s -> 10570.98s]  Yeah.
[10570.98s -> 10572.16s]  Is it, like, is it?
[10572.16s -> 10573.90s]  Metropolis isn't this?
[10573.90s -> 10578.99s]  Well, Metropolis is always referenced in Gotham.
[10578.99s -> 10584.78s]  Oh my god, Jerm is nasty on this Velma.
[10584.78s -> 10590.64s]  Oh, I gotta get that call in.
[10590.64s -> 10599.54s]  Oh shit, that's basing.
[10599.54s -> 10601.86s]  Dude, you have dodged so many times, I don't know why.
[10601.86s -> 10603.50s]  Oh boy!
[10603.50s -> 10604.34s]  I don't know how you keep a voice.
[10604.34s -> 10605.90s]  My body!
[10605.90s -> 10607.46s]  Let's go!
[10607.46s -> 10609.46s]  Let's fucking go!
[10609.46s -> 10611.42s]  Every hole filled at the end there.
[10611.42s -> 10613.86s]  I could not recover on that.
[10613.86s -> 10616.66s]  Jerma was popping for a minute.
[10616.66s -> 10618.98s]  Dude, that was incredible, Jerma.
[10618.98s -> 10620.66s]  That was a clinic.
[10620.66s -> 10621.50s]  Oh my god.
[10621.50s -> 10622.34s]  Hey, come on.
[10622.34s -> 10623.50s]  That was a fucking clinic.
[10623.50s -> 10627.24s]  Wait, Ludwig, I think your bug is back on.
[10627.24s -> 10632.25s]  Yeah, I gotta just...
[10632.25s -> 10633.41s]  Yeah, just check the forums real quick.
[10633.41s -> 10634.61s]  I'm sure they have a solution.
[10634.61s -> 10635.85s]  This game is fun, man.
[10635.85s -> 10637.31s]  This game is fun.
[10637.31s -> 10638.69s]  This is a lot of fun, yeah.
[10639.29s -> 10641.81s]  Especially Victory, the sweet nectar.
[10641.81s -> 10644.09s]  Oh, yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.
[10644.09s -> 10644.93s]  You know what, I don't...
[10644.93s -> 10645.77s]  Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.
[10645.77s -> 10647.81s]  Wait, wait, wait, I gotta mention something here.
[10647.81s -> 10649.93s]  Stop yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.
[10649.93s -> 10652.81s]  Okay, will Jerma, will Hasana Jerma win?
[10652.81s -> 10657.81s]  Yes, got fucking four million points and no 29 million.
[10658.05s -> 10660.01s]  Oh, what a big believer moment.
[10660.01s -> 10661.77s]  When was the last time you guys drank a Trenta
[10661.77s -> 10662.65s]  from Starbucks?
[10664.33s -> 10666.65s]  I've actually never ordered one ever.
[10666.65s -> 10667.49s]  I did one of those today.
[10667.49s -> 10668.33s]  I've never even heard of it.
[10668.97s -> 10670.18s]  You've never ordered what?
[10670.18s -> 10671.30s]  You ordered one?
[10671.30s -> 10674.02s]  This is like the secret large.
[10674.02s -> 10675.26s]  It's 32 ounces.
[10678.97s -> 10680.37s]  What did you order?
[10680.37s -> 10683.60s]  It's a Trenta.
[10683.60s -> 10685.16s]  Choose your character.
[10685.16s -> 10686.28s]  I have no idea what that is.
[10686.28s -> 10691.04s]  Okay, Starbucks has tall, grande, and venti, right?
[10691.04s -> 10693.40s]  That's small, medium, large, but you can order a Trenta
[10693.40s -> 10697.18s]  and it's an extra large, a 32 ounce iced coffee.
[10697.18s -> 10698.00s]  I love that.
[10698.00s -> 10698.84s]  It's on the secret menu.
[10698.84s -> 10701.32s]  What's your Starbucks order?
[10701.32s -> 10702.86s]  Oh, bro.
[10702.86s -> 10707.50s]  Trenta, hazelnut iced coffee with three pumps.
[10707.50s -> 10708.62s]  Wait, this is a lie.
[10708.62s -> 10713.62s]  So Trenta iced coffee with three pumps of brown sugar syrup
[10713.62s -> 10715.90s]  with a splash of oat milk.
[10715.90s -> 10717.02s]  That's insane.
[10717.02s -> 10717.86s]  That's not bad.
[10717.86s -> 10718.68s]  Splash of oat milk is good though.
[10718.68s -> 10719.52s]  Good call on that.
[10719.52s -> 10720.66s]  Hey, Lud, are you having a hard time
[10720.66s -> 10722.78s]  because there's no Jigglypuff in this game?
[10722.78s -> 10724.54s]  Dude, just because you know a reference
[10724.54s -> 10726.06s]  doesn't mean you need to say that a lot.
[10726.06s -> 10728.94s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[10728.94s -> 10731.82s]  Are you upset that I fucking nailed you?
[10731.82s -> 10732.70s]  It's okay.
[10732.74s -> 10735.14s]  All right, let's just put $5,000 on this one.
[10735.14s -> 10737.70s]  Wait, hold on, wait a minute.
[10737.70s -> 10739.02s]  Dude, okay, dude.
[10739.02s -> 10740.14s]  Are we on Taz?
[10740.14s -> 10740.98s]  This is between you two.
[10740.98s -> 10742.38s]  This is between you two.
[10742.38s -> 10743.22s]  Nevermind, he's on Taz.
[10743.22s -> 10744.06s]  Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.
[10744.06s -> 10745.22s]  By the way, people are freaking out.
[10745.22s -> 10748.70s]  They think you get no sugar syrup in it.
[10748.70s -> 10751.22s]  You only get three pumps of brown sugar syrup.
[10751.22s -> 10752.26s]  Three pumps is standard.
[10752.26s -> 10753.98s]  They put three pumps in a grande normally.
[10753.98s -> 10755.34s]  We're playing friendly games
[10755.34s -> 10757.58s]  and Lud's like put $5,000 on.
[10760.56s -> 10762.32s]  No, there's no classic in here.
[10762.32s -> 10763.16s]  Excuse me.
[10769.02s -> 10771.74s]  That's the only way I got this one.
[10771.74s -> 10774.46s]  Oh my God, I didn't expect that.
[10774.46s -> 10776.64s]  Oh, best song of the game.
[10776.64s -> 10777.48s]  True.
[10777.48s -> 10778.30s]  What song is fire?
[10778.30s -> 10779.14s]  What is it from?
[10779.14s -> 10779.98s]  Steven Universe.
[10779.98s -> 10781.16s]  I think Steven Universe, yeah.
[10781.16s -> 10782.00s]  Yeah.
[10782.00s -> 10782.82s]  Oh my God.
[10788.09s -> 10790.93s]  Oh my God, that tornado's disgusting.
[10790.93s -> 10792.01s]  Tornado's kind of nasty.
[10792.01s -> 10793.45s]  It's disgusting, it really is.
[10793.45s -> 10799.44s]  Just metanite.
[10799.44s -> 10800.28s]  Oh shit.
[10800.28s -> 10801.12s]  Oh, chew him up.
[10801.12s -> 10802.00s]  Wait, did you eat him?
[10802.00s -> 10803.12s]  That's sick.
[10803.12s -> 10804.04s]  It's hard to get though.
[10804.04s -> 10804.88s]  It's hard to do.
[10809.95s -> 10811.91s]  Oh boy, what a combo.
[10811.91s -> 10818.20s]  Tossed him right into it.
[10818.20s -> 10823.82s]  What?
[10823.82s -> 10827.18s]  Oh, you slippery, slippery bastard.
[10827.18s -> 10828.02s]  No.
[10832.70s -> 10834.70s]  Oh my God, he's got 152.
[10840.13s -> 10841.57s]  No way.
[10841.57s -> 10842.53s]  What the fuck?
[10842.53s -> 10846.35s]  No way.
[10846.35s -> 10847.51s]  Oh my God.
[10847.51s -> 10849.07s]  No, how?
[10849.07s -> 10851.11s]  With 158, how?
[10851.11s -> 10852.11s]  With a double KO?
[10854.21s -> 10856.01s]  Okay, we'll get fucked on that one.
[10859.90s -> 10861.58s]  Oh shit, that thing is bad.
[10862.74s -> 10864.78s]  I'm gonna get fucked on this, I think.
[10872.02s -> 10872.86s]  I can't believe that.
[10872.86s -> 10874.26s]  Peace.
[10874.26s -> 10875.10s]  Bitch.
[10881.37s -> 10882.65s]  Who said that?
[10882.65s -> 10883.49s]  That was Matt, man.
[10883.49s -> 10887.03s]  Oh, I thought that was Taz.
[10887.03s -> 10889.07s]  Imagine, Taz is full anime.
[10889.07s -> 10890.67s]  He just speaks full English.
[10894.10s -> 10896.66s]  Wait, Taz can speak English, right?
[10896.66s -> 10897.82s]  No, isn't he gonna go like,
[10897.82s -> 10899.06s]  what the fuck?
[10899.06s -> 10901.86s]  No, he's like Scooby-Doo.
[10901.86s -> 10904.38s]  He's like, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[10905.22s -> 10907.02s]  Scooby-Doo does not speak full English.
[10907.02s -> 10908.22s]  Yes, he does.
[10908.22s -> 10909.30s]  He doesn't speak full English.
[10909.30s -> 10910.50s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[10910.50s -> 10913.06s]  He'll do like little grunts and then like throw in a word.
[10913.06s -> 10915.46s]  No, he's like, Taz want action.
[10915.46s -> 10917.26s]  Right, he says more shit.
[10917.26s -> 10919.74s]  He has never said, Taz want action.
[10919.74s -> 10920.58s]  Yes, he does.
[10920.58s -> 10921.42s]  I used to have a toy.
[10921.42s -> 10923.90s]  You pressed his chest and he went, Taz want action.
[10925.66s -> 10927.30s]  Taz want action.
[10928.42s -> 10930.46s]  I swear to God, somebody's gonna find a clip.
[10938.69s -> 10940.73s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[10940.73s -> 10941.57s]  Let's go.
[10943.29s -> 10946.51s]  No, no, no.
[10946.51s -> 10948.03s]  What the fuck was that?
[10948.03s -> 10949.83s]  Wait, is that Batman?
[10949.83s -> 10951.79s]  Or is that Tasmanian devil, for sure?
[10953.06s -> 10953.90s]  Definitely Batman.
[10953.90s -> 10957.02s]  Oh, that's scary.
[10957.02s -> 10959.02s]  Dude, you're abusing that, okay?
[10959.02s -> 10959.86s]  I absolutely am.
[10959.86s -> 10961.38s]  You're so abusing me.
[10961.38s -> 10962.94s]  What just happened?
[10962.94s -> 10965.71s]  No, baby, yeah.
[10965.71s -> 10966.95s]  Oh my God.
[10966.95s -> 10967.79s]  I couldn't jump.
[10967.79s -> 10970.39s]  Why did Batman say, you wanna slobber all over me?
[10970.39s -> 10971.79s]  It fucked me up a little bit.
[10971.79s -> 10974.63s]  To get to the other side.
[10974.67s -> 10976.39s]  I played so poorly that round.
[10976.39s -> 10978.31s]  I played so poorly.
[10978.31s -> 10979.15s]  Oh, scary.
[10979.15s -> 10980.83s]  I think we all did pretty good,
[10980.83s -> 10982.51s]  except for Ludwig, honestly.
[10982.51s -> 10985.19s]  I literally got more damage than no one.
[10987.11s -> 10988.91s]  You got a KO than a Lud, that was crucial.
[10988.91s -> 10990.83s]  Lud, do you have a controller?
[10990.83s -> 10993.15s]  No, I do, but it won't connect.
[10993.15s -> 10993.99s]  I cannot figure out
[10993.99s -> 10995.67s]  how to get my Xbox controller to connect.
[10995.67s -> 10998.11s]  Is it the USB micro standard bullshit?
[10998.11s -> 10999.31s]  I have the controller.
[10999.31s -> 11000.23s]  I have plugged it in.
[11000.23s -> 11001.11s]  It is plugged in.
[11001.11s -> 11004.90s]  It just doesn't work.
[11004.90s -> 11006.62s]  You guys wanna do FFA?
[11006.62s -> 11007.46s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[11007.46s -> 11012.22s]  Let's go for it.
[11012.22s -> 11014.37s]  Okay, I gotta pee real quick.
[11014.37s -> 11015.45s]  Stop saying remove the batteries.
[11015.45s -> 11017.41s]  Choose your character.
[11017.41s -> 11018.93s]  Can we do a pee break?
[11018.93s -> 11020.33s]  You guys wanna do a pee break?
[11020.33s -> 11021.53s]  Uh.
[11021.53s -> 11022.89s]  You have 38 seconds.
[11022.89s -> 11024.09s]  After this we can.
[11024.09s -> 11024.93s]  Yeah.
[11024.93s -> 11025.97s]  It won't look any different
[11025.97s -> 11027.77s]  if you're playing or not today.
[11027.77s -> 11028.61s]  Okay.
[11032.53s -> 11035.46s]  I'm gonna try this dog.
[11035.46s -> 11039.02s]  Oh, the original content dog in here?
[11039.02s -> 11041.18s]  Yep, original content dog.
[11041.18s -> 11042.78s]  That guy's nuts, actually.
[11042.78s -> 11043.78s]  Is he good?
[11043.82s -> 11055.07s]  Yeah, he's actually really good.
[11055.07s -> 11057.92s]  Guarantee Hasan doesn't wash his hands.
[11057.92s -> 11059.77s]  There's no time.
[11059.77s -> 11060.73s]  No, he'll do it.
[11060.73s -> 11066.67s]  He'll make it back.
[11066.67s -> 11068.95s]  Two shaggies.
[11068.95s -> 11071.78s]  Yeah, I'm busting out the main for this one.
[11071.78s -> 11073.53s]  Okay.
[11073.53s -> 11081.46s]  All right.
[11081.46s -> 11083.43s]  Did they both go pee?
[11083.43s -> 11087.38s]  I'm not sure.
[11087.38s -> 11089.78s]  So what's your assessment so far at this game?
[11089.78s -> 11090.62s]  Oh, I love the game.
[11090.62s -> 11092.74s]  I played it a lot during the tech test.
[11092.74s -> 11094.62s]  So I'm pretty well versed on it.
[11094.62s -> 11096.06s]  I think it's great.
[11096.06s -> 11097.54s]  I love the game.
[11097.54s -> 11099.90s]  And we're no longer in ad hours.
[11099.90s -> 11100.98s]  I'm not contractually,
[11101.70s -> 11103.26s]  I'm not contractually obligated to say that.
[11103.26s -> 11104.46s]  No, it's just a great game.
[11104.46s -> 11106.54s]  It's just an absolutely fun game.
[11106.54s -> 11107.38s]  Prepare yourself.
[11107.38s -> 11108.22s]  All right.
[11108.22s -> 11110.54s]  I had an argument with my chat about this.
[11110.54s -> 11111.98s]  Wait, what the fuck is that character?
[11111.98s -> 11113.30s]  What?
[11113.30s -> 11114.46s]  It's OC for the game.
[11114.46s -> 11115.94s]  You don't know Rain Dog?
[11115.94s -> 11118.26s]  You've never seen Rain Dog coming home?
[11119.85s -> 11120.69s]  How do you not know his name?
[11120.69s -> 11122.73s]  Grandma got run over by a Rain Dog?
[11122.73s -> 11124.77s]  You've never seen Rain Dog coming home?
[11124.77s -> 11126.77s]  I've never seen Rain Dog come anywhere.
[11126.77s -> 11128.85s]  It's like, it has like a hundred million views
[11128.85s -> 11140.21s]  or something, whatever.
[11140.37s -> 11142.25s]  Oh, I'm getting destroyed.
[11147.79s -> 11149.15s]  What the hell is that?
[11149.15s -> 11150.31s]  Oh shit.
[11150.31s -> 11159.66s]  Okay.
[11159.66s -> 11161.96s]  Oh, it's fire.
[11161.96s -> 11164.84s]  Yeah, you have like a projectile and then like a fire.
[11164.84s -> 11169.82s]  Why would I grab you?
[11169.82s -> 11171.70s]  Oh, come on.
[11176.96s -> 11177.80s]  You're insecure.
[11177.80s -> 11178.64s]  That was an easy one.
[11178.64s -> 11179.48s]  You got it.
[11179.48s -> 11180.32s]  You're insecure.
[11180.32s -> 11181.16s]  I was working on him.
[11181.16s -> 11190.20s]  I haven't seen metahuman activity like that.
[11190.20s -> 11193.21s]  Oh, the flank.
[11193.21s -> 11194.05s]  Yeah.
[11194.21s -> 11196.65s]  I think I got to take this guy into the lab.
[11196.65s -> 11197.49s]  No.
[11197.49s -> 11198.33s]  Wait, what?
[11198.33s -> 11199.53s]  Oh my God.
[11199.53s -> 11200.41s]  That was nasty.
[11208.34s -> 11209.62s]  What are you doing, Batman?
[11209.62s -> 11210.46s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[11210.46s -> 11211.30s]  How is that?
[11211.30s -> 11212.62s]  Oh, I'm so fucked, dude.
[11212.62s -> 11213.46s]  What the hell?
[11213.46s -> 11214.30s]  Why did I chase you?
[11214.30s -> 11215.14s]  Oh my Lord.
[11215.14s -> 11216.46s]  I can't believe it.
[11216.46s -> 11217.30s]  I'm killing myself.
[11217.30s -> 11219.66s]  Yo, can someone fucking kill Big Moist, please?
[11219.66s -> 11220.50s]  I just died twice.
[11220.50s -> 11222.70s]  I've killed myself like twice now.
[11222.70s -> 11225.62s]  Does that mean ring out double bonus though?
[11225.62s -> 11227.38s]  I don't, you're speaking gamer words
[11227.38s -> 11229.99s]  that not even I know.
[11230.15s -> 11236.97s]  Gamer words.
[11236.97s -> 11238.17s]  What is popping right now?
[11238.17s -> 11243.50s]  Oh my God.
[11243.50s -> 11246.50s]  Why do you get to kick when I pull?
[11246.50s -> 11248.34s]  Why?
[11248.34s -> 11249.18s]  I knew that.
[11249.18s -> 11251.38s]  Get ya.
[11251.38s -> 11252.94s]  Oh, you have 19 points?
[11252.94s -> 11254.26s]  Wait, did you get that one too?
[11254.26s -> 11255.10s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[11255.10s -> 11255.94s]  You already just got it.
[11255.94s -> 11256.78s]  What the hell?
[11256.78s -> 11257.62s]  23 points?
[11257.62s -> 11258.90s]  How?
[11258.90s -> 11259.98s]  I have zero.
[11259.98s -> 11260.82s]  What?
[11260.82s -> 11267.78s]  Even fucker controllers aren't even plugged in.
[11267.78s -> 11268.66s]  What?
[11268.66s -> 11269.62s]  I just killed myself.
[11269.62s -> 11270.58s]  I have zero points now.
[11270.58s -> 11271.42s]  Fuck me.
[11271.42s -> 11272.26s]  I'm worse than Ludd.
[11272.26s -> 11273.10s]  This is devastating.
[11280.44s -> 11281.28s]  That felt good.
[11281.28s -> 11282.12s]  That was so bad.
[11282.12s -> 11282.96s]  I wonder who won that one.
[11282.96s -> 11288.94s]  That was so bad.
[11288.94s -> 11290.86s]  Oh man, you gotta love those kinds of matches.
[11290.86s -> 11291.70s]  I gotta tell ya.
[11291.70s -> 11295.42s]  Dude, you are the king of kill stealing, Moist.
[11295.42s -> 11296.26s]  I don't know.
[11296.26s -> 11297.58s]  No, no, no, no.
[11297.58s -> 11299.22s]  The damage says otherwise.
[11299.22s -> 11300.50s]  Okay, bro.
[11300.50s -> 11302.70s]  Our damage is not even remotely close.
[11302.70s -> 11303.70s]  So yes, you are right.
[11303.70s -> 11306.06s]  But that was fun.
[11306.06s -> 11308.38s]  Yeah, I use numbers over here.
[11308.38s -> 11311.94s]  Is your bug also transferring over to your points as well
[11311.94s -> 11312.90s]  as your damage?
[11314.32s -> 11316.19s]  You wanna check that?
[11316.19s -> 11317.99s]  Choose your character.
[11317.99s -> 11319.39s]  That was nasty, by the way.
[11319.39s -> 11321.59s]  We got all, we got absolutely slam dunked on.
[11321.59s -> 11322.43s]  Ludd.
[11322.43s -> 11323.95s]  That was, yeah, that felt good.
[11323.95s -> 11324.79s]  It felt good for me.
[11324.79s -> 11327.49s]  That was a nice match.
[11327.49s -> 11328.97s]  All right, people want me to play as Jake.
[11328.97s -> 11331.18s]  I'll try it.
[11331.18s -> 11332.18s]  Is he don't-a-walling me
[11332.18s -> 11335.74s]  because he's the worst person on this lobby?
[11335.74s -> 11337.54s]  Just by being a sweaty smash player?
[11337.54s -> 11338.38s]  1v1 me.
[11338.38s -> 11340.22s]  1v1 me right now.
[11340.22s -> 11342.70s]  I will after we're done, you know,
[11342.70s -> 11344.54s]  after I'm done wiping the floors with you.
[11344.54s -> 11345.66s]  I would watch that.
[11346.30s -> 11347.14s]  I'd actually really like to watch that.
[11347.14s -> 11348.10s]  Is there spectators?
[11348.10s -> 11350.82s]  After I'm done whipping you like a towel?
[11350.82s -> 11352.62s]  I mean, we can do, we just do free for all
[11352.62s -> 11353.86s]  and we just stand away.
[11353.86s -> 11355.58s]  Oh, true, true, true.
[11355.58s -> 11356.74s]  Stand on the side.
[11356.74s -> 11358.42s]  Do you guys wanna hash that out right now?
[11358.42s -> 11359.26s]  You could.
[11359.26s -> 11360.43s]  Yeah, let's hash it out right now.
[11360.43s -> 11361.27s]  Let's hash it out right now.
[11361.27s -> 11362.11s]  Come on, big man.
[11362.11s -> 11362.95s]  Batman versus Superman.
[11362.95s -> 11363.79s]  Old school.
[11363.79s -> 11365.31s]  Okay, that's canonical.
[11365.31s -> 11367.95s]  Adventure time crew's just gonna hang out in the bleachers.
[11367.95s -> 11369.19s]  You're canonically dumb.
[11369.19s -> 11370.47s]  Oh, hey, Ludd, you gotta go like this.
[11370.47s -> 11371.71s]  Fucking so good, dude.
[11371.71s -> 11373.03s]  You're gonna go like what?
[11373.43s -> 11374.51s]  Do you believe?
[11376.51s -> 11377.95s]  Prepare yourself.
[11377.95s -> 11379.19s]  Are you doing Batman?
[11379.19s -> 11380.03s]  Yeah.
[11381.11s -> 11383.39s]  No, you gotta go, do you believe?
[11387.01s -> 11389.65s]  You know you're not doing it.
[11389.65s -> 11391.65s]  You sound like Batman as a stoma.
[11392.57s -> 11394.81s]  We can't do free for all when you guys stand on the sidelines
[11394.81s -> 11397.01s]  because accidentally we're gonna get points.
[11397.01s -> 11397.85s]  No, no, we're on the bottom.
[11397.85s -> 11398.69s]  We're on the bottom.
[11398.69s -> 11399.53s]  Yeah, here.
[11399.53s -> 11400.57s]  We'll come up, we'll come up.
[11400.57s -> 11401.41s]  We will.
[11401.41s -> 11402.29s]  We'll go all the way to the top.
[11402.29s -> 11403.13s]  Wait, wait.
[11403.13s -> 11403.97s]  Wait, what?
[11404.09s -> 11408.85s]  What are you?
[11408.85s -> 11409.89s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[11409.89s -> 11411.97s]  This is gonna be embarrassing.
[11411.97s -> 11417.38s]  Yes, I'm excited.
[11417.38s -> 11418.50s]  Hassan, freeze breath.
[11418.50s -> 11419.34s]  You have freeze breath.
[11419.34s -> 11420.50s]  It's really good.
[11420.50s -> 11421.42s]  I don't know how to do that.
[11421.42s -> 11422.26s]  How do I do that?
[11422.26s -> 11423.66s]  Standard triangle.
[11436.41s -> 11437.29s]  Oh shit.
[11437.29s -> 11440.36s]  The weekend is too powerful.
[11440.36s -> 11441.20s]  All right.
[11445.88s -> 11448.16s]  Oh, good movement, Ludd.
[11448.16s -> 11449.00s]  That was actually really good.
[11449.00s -> 11452.06s]  What the hell?
[11452.06s -> 11454.74s]  Bro, you're using items in a one on one.
[11454.74s -> 11455.70s]  I'm in the lead.
[11455.74s -> 11457.06s]  You dead ass just picked up an item
[11457.06s -> 11457.90s]  and healed all your health.
[11457.90s -> 11459.74s]  Wait, am I not allowed to?
[11459.74s -> 11460.58s]  Wait, is that bad?
[11460.58s -> 11461.54s]  I actually don't know.
[11461.54s -> 11462.38s]  You've been using items?
[11462.38s -> 11463.22s]  No, I get it, I get it, bro.
[11463.22s -> 11464.06s]  I get it.
[11464.06s -> 11465.14s]  You dragon ass diss, come on.
[11465.14s -> 11465.98s]  Wait, what?
[11465.98s -> 11466.82s]  I'm sorry, you've been using items?
[11466.82s -> 11467.66s]  No, no, bro, I get it, bro.
[11467.66s -> 11474.96s]  Hey, I get it.
[11474.96s -> 11477.22s]  You've got him now, Ludd.
[11477.22s -> 11481.06s]  I just need to wait for an item to spawn.
[11481.06s -> 11483.26s]  I'm the most annoying guy in the movie theater.
[11484.38s -> 11485.58s]  Oh, that's you laughing?
[11499.26s -> 11500.10s]  Wait, what?
[11500.10s -> 11501.30s]  Dude, come on.
[11501.30s -> 11502.14s]  What?
[11502.14s -> 11504.02s]  Oh, I thought you got that kill.
[11504.02s -> 11508.46s]  I'm just being annoying.
[11508.46s -> 11510.02s]  You have a smoke screen, by the way, Ludd.
[11510.02s -> 11511.14s]  You might want to use it.
[11511.14s -> 11512.58s]  Oh.
[11512.58s -> 11513.42s]  What was that?
[11513.42s -> 11514.50s]  That's all right.
[11514.50s -> 11516.30s]  Maybe I should have brought my clip tonight.
[11516.30s -> 11519.89s]  I feel like I haven't done damage to you in an hour.
[11519.89s -> 11523.23s]  That smoke screen's good.
[11523.23s -> 11525.74s]  Nice.
[11525.74s -> 11526.58s]  Good up air.
[11526.58s -> 11530.26s]  Stop healing, you son of a bitch.
[11530.26s -> 11531.54s]  Good up air.
[11531.54s -> 11532.46s]  Watch out.
[11532.46s -> 11533.30s]  No!
[11533.30s -> 11534.14s]  Jesus Christ.
[11534.14s -> 11536.26s]  This is so fucking lame.
[11536.26s -> 11538.58s]  He's full healed like three times.
[11538.58s -> 11541.42s]  Yeah, he just keeps getting the giant med packs.
[11542.86s -> 11544.86s]  Oh no.
[11544.86s -> 11546.90s]  Should we keep going?
[11546.90s -> 11548.10s]  I mean, it's over now.
[11552.65s -> 11553.49s]  What was that for?
[11553.49s -> 11554.33s]  $5,000, right?
[11554.33s -> 11555.17s]  No Jigglypuff.
[11555.17s -> 11556.21s]  It's fine.
[11556.21s -> 11557.94s]  No Jigglypuff.
[11557.94s -> 11559.45s]  Disconnected.
[11559.45s -> 11560.37s]  I'm disconnected.
[11560.37s -> 11561.57s]  I'm going to get my fucking controller working
[11561.57s -> 11563.29s]  and I'm going to come back.
[11563.29s -> 11564.61s]  I'm not playing another second
[11564.61s -> 11566.61s]  with this cheating keyboard mouse.
[11566.61s -> 11568.01s]  Let's go!
[11568.01s -> 11568.85s]  That was a good fight.
[11568.85s -> 11570.97s]  That was a good run.
[11570.97s -> 11572.17s]  Hey, good game, man.
[11572.17s -> 11573.77s]  Is what I would say if you played a good game,
[11573.77s -> 11574.77s]  but you played a terrible game.
[11575.61s -> 11576.45s]  I'm sorry.
[11576.45s -> 11577.29s]  I must report.
[11577.29s -> 11578.13s]  You just sit there and all you do
[11578.13s -> 11580.53s]  is just accumulate the wealth of health packs.
[11582.21s -> 11584.62s]  Medicare for all, baby.
[11584.62s -> 11585.46s]  For one.
[11585.46s -> 11586.94s]  For one.
[11586.94s -> 11589.86s]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know,
[11589.86s -> 11591.94s]  if you need to use it, you should be able to use it
[11591.94s -> 11594.00s]  is my argument.
[11594.00s -> 11594.84s]  All right, what are we doing?
[11594.84s -> 11595.72s]  Are we continuing?
[11595.72s -> 11596.56s]  Yeah, what's the plan?
[11596.56s -> 11597.68s]  You get that controller set up?
[11597.68s -> 11598.52s]  What's going on?
[11598.52s -> 11600.12s]  You guys, you do a free.
[11600.12s -> 11600.96s]  Free for all?
[11600.96s -> 11601.80s]  That's a bad winner.
[11601.80s -> 11603.60s]  Okay, guys, I'm not a gamer.
[11603.60s -> 11606.44s]  Like, I'm not being serious either.
[11606.44s -> 11609.20s]  Ludwig could fucking wipe the floor with me in every game.
[11609.20s -> 11610.04s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[11610.04s -> 11610.88s]  Except for this one.
[11610.88s -> 11613.32s]  Hassan, you beat Elden Ring, didn't you?
[11613.32s -> 11614.62s]  I did.
[11614.62s -> 11616.06s]  I was better than Lud on that too.
[11616.06s -> 11618.06s]  But you can't, you're a gamer.
[11618.06s -> 11619.86s]  If you can beat Elden Ring.
[11619.86s -> 11620.74s]  If you can beat Elden Ring,
[11620.74s -> 11627.86s]  I think you get the gamer card, I'd say.
[11627.86s -> 11632.50s]  This non-gamer beat me multiple times.
[11634.90s -> 11636.74s]  All right, I think we have to make a new party, right?
[11636.74s -> 11637.58s]  Yeah.
[11637.58s -> 11638.42s]  Yeah.
[11638.42s -> 11640.26s]  Who has everybody on a friend's list?
[11640.26s -> 11643.12s]  I think it's, is it you, Hassan?
[11643.12s -> 11645.78s]  I believe so.
[11645.78s -> 11647.26s]  We're all in the recently played though,
[11647.26s -> 11648.62s]  so you can just invite through there
[11648.62s -> 11649.78s]  if you wanna host again, German.
[11649.78s -> 11655.06s]  Or Hassan hosts, it doesn't matter.
[11655.06s -> 11657.53s]  I guess, like this?
[11657.53s -> 11659.33s]  Dude, when I alt-tab, it's so annoying.
[11659.33s -> 11661.53s]  It just like, is stuck.
[11661.53s -> 11664.46s]  How do I?
[11664.46s -> 11666.50s]  Doesn't say anybody else is online.
[11666.50s -> 11668.38s]  Go to tab, recently played with.
[11668.38s -> 11670.26s]  Up on the top right corner is his social.
[11670.26s -> 11671.54s]  Go to tab, recently played with.
[11671.54s -> 11672.90s]  It should come up as Commodore Pack.
[11672.90s -> 11674.30s]  Oh, there it is, okay.
[11674.78s -> 11678.81s]  Yeah.
[11678.81s -> 11682.37s]  Which Commodore Pack, I sent you a invite.
[11682.37s -> 11684.49s]  Wait, no, that's not, who's Commodore Pack?
[11684.49s -> 11687.53s]  Wait, oh shit, oh wait, I think that's, is that Lyric?
[11687.53s -> 11689.17s]  That might be Lyric, yeah.
[11689.17s -> 11691.09s]  I'm probably like, oops.
[11691.93s -> 11696.70s]  I'm not pressing win-tab chat, I'm not.
[11696.70s -> 11697.82s]  They're gonna be like, is this Germa?
[11697.82s -> 11708.32s]  Like, why is, Germa's like pinging me?
[11708.32s -> 11711.24s]  Are you guys getting those invites?
[11711.24s -> 11712.48s]  No, I haven't got it yet.
[11712.48s -> 11714.44s]  Mine's the big moist.
[11714.44s -> 11719.07s]  Yeah, I should, it says party invite.
[11719.07s -> 11721.54s]  I tried inviting everybody.
[11721.54s -> 11723.22s]  Am I like still in your party or something?
[11723.22s -> 11726.82s]  I'm not seeing it, and I'm also not able to,
[11726.82s -> 11733.14s]  I don't know how to do a, I don't know how to do a party.
[11733.14s -> 11736.06s]  Oh, okay, custom, okay, okay, create all my lobby.
[11736.06s -> 11737.70s]  Oh, you have to actually make a custom game first.
[11737.70s -> 11738.62s]  Yeah, yeah, I'm making it right now,
[11738.62s -> 11739.46s]  I'm making it right now.
[11739.46s -> 11742.39s]  Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.
[11742.39s -> 11745.63s]  Wait, oh my God, my fucking keyboard is broken.
[11745.63s -> 11748.32s]  Wait, there's something wrong with my keyboard.
[11748.32s -> 11752.38s]  I press escape and the windows button works.
[11752.38s -> 11753.22s]  Like.
[11753.22s -> 11755.88s]  Dude, you need to get a whole new computer.
[11755.92s -> 11757.44s]  Wait, what the fuck?
[11757.44s -> 11762.25s]  That is weird, hold up.
[11762.25s -> 11764.37s]  Yeah, dude, I think your graphics card, your hard drive,
[11764.37s -> 11765.57s]  your memory, it's all gone.
[11765.57s -> 11768.09s]  I'm not kidding, I'm like literally pressing escape.
[11768.09s -> 11770.93s]  That's why it was locking whenever I alt tab.
[11770.93s -> 11773.13s]  When I press escape, the windows,
[11773.13s -> 11777.26s]  it triggers the windows key for no reason.
[11777.26s -> 11778.98s]  Really, that's weird.
[11778.98s -> 11782.07s]  Yeah, my control is not even on right now,
[11782.07s -> 11786.62s]  but it thinks it's like, no, my control is not stuck.
[11786.62s -> 11791.54s]  Maybe just restart the game.
[11791.54s -> 11794.02s]  Yeah, it might just be like memory leak or something,
[11794.02s -> 11795.18s]  I couldn't tell you.
[11795.18s -> 11799.79s]  Just try reloading.
[11799.79s -> 11800.83s]  Oh, okay, it's working.
[11800.83s -> 11804.23s]  I just like, I unplugged it and I slammed it a bunch of times
[11804.23s -> 11805.19s]  and it's working now.
[11805.19s -> 11812.02s]  I'm going to the lab, I wanna check out something.
[11812.02s -> 11814.76s]  Yeah, I mean, Velma, seriously,
[11814.76s -> 11818.76s]  Velma's standard attack is a projectile and it's awesome.
[11818.76s -> 11820.00s]  No, your Velma was nasty.
[11820.00s -> 11821.68s]  Scarlet Otter is you, right?
[11821.68s -> 11823.78s]  Yeah.
[11823.78s -> 11827.28s]  Okay, big moist, added, invited player.
[11828.91s -> 11832.21s]  The only person I don't have is Ludd
[11832.21s -> 11838.34s]  and I think I added him, but Ludd,
[11839.14s -> 11840.86s]  is he there?
[11840.86s -> 11844.26s]  He's furiously going through cabinets
[11844.26s -> 11847.66s]  to try to find a way to plug a controller in, I think.
[11847.66s -> 11848.66s]  Isn't he sitting it out?
[11848.66s -> 11853.45s]  He said, you guys, did I beat his ass so mercilessly
[11853.45s -> 11854.69s]  that he had to fucking rage quit?
[11854.69s -> 11856.45s]  That's crazy, that's so sad.
[11856.45s -> 11858.21s]  You actually just spanked him so hard
[11858.21s -> 11860.01s]  that he's now spending like 20 minutes
[11860.01s -> 11861.49s]  to getting a controller to work.
[11861.49s -> 11864.09s]  That's wild, that's a wild state of affairs, man.
[11864.09s -> 11871.34s]  You hate to see it.
[11871.34s -> 11873.63s]  We're not even in the title, Jerma.
[11873.63s -> 11875.35s]  It just says big stream for Top G's only,
[11875.35s -> 11879.04s]  multi-versus with big man, Penguinzo.
[11879.04s -> 11879.88s]  Who?
[11879.88s -> 11880.72s]  You see that?
[11880.72s -> 11882.26s]  What, my stream title?
[11882.26s -> 11883.90s]  No, I'm saying Ludd's stream title.
[11883.90s -> 11885.82s]  Oh, Ludd's stream title.
[11885.82s -> 11888.35s]  No one's in my stream title.
[11888.35s -> 11889.87s]  My stream title is dog shit.
[11889.87s -> 11891.91s]  I freaked out because I moved to the sponsor segment
[11891.91s -> 11892.95s]  and I was like, I don't know what to title this.
[11892.95s -> 11895.19s]  So I was like, let's go bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.
[11895.19s -> 11898.90s]  I don't know.
[11898.90s -> 11900.10s]  You don't do a lot of sponsorships, do you?
[11900.10s -> 11902.58s]  Like gaming sponsorships?
[11902.58s -> 11906.86s]  I mean, recently I have been.
[11906.86s -> 11911.89s]  Kind of a new thing.
[11911.89s -> 11913.87s]  It just says bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.
[11913.87s -> 11914.71s]  It says add the title.
[11914.71s -> 11917.85s]  Ludd is working with his tech for the control.
[11917.85s -> 11920.17s]  This is why Ludd doesn't hang out with you.
[11920.17s -> 11921.01s]  Okay.
[11921.01s -> 11923.13s]  That's kind of fucked up.
[11923.13s -> 11924.53s]  That is fucked up.
[11924.53s -> 11926.77s]  And the real reason is because,
[11926.77s -> 11929.40s]  wait, hazards enabled by the way or no?
[11929.40s -> 11930.72s]  No, and then I turn those off
[11930.72s -> 11934.54s]  if we're going to be doing some FFA.
[11934.54s -> 11936.70s]  Actually, just let it be wacky.
[11936.70s -> 11938.14s]  You can do some hazards.
[11938.14s -> 11938.98s]  Let it ride, fuck it.
[11938.98s -> 11939.82s]  It'll be wacky.
[11939.82s -> 11943.94s]  Free for all time, two and a half minutes.
[11943.94s -> 11945.14s]  Yeah, it says bugs that many times
[11945.14s -> 11951.86s]  because I'm a bugs main.
[11951.86s -> 11953.54s]  I'm going to take this moment to use the restroom.
[11953.54s -> 11954.74s]  I'll be right back, boys.
[11954.74s -> 11955.58s]  Actually, you know what?
[11955.58s -> 11957.30s]  That's probably a good idea.
[11957.30s -> 11959.21s]  Are you looking for a time to go pee, Hassan?
[11959.21s -> 11960.05s]  I already did.
[11960.05s -> 11960.89s]  Oh, okay.
[11960.89s -> 11961.88s]  I'm so quick with it.
[11961.88s -> 11963.61s]  I do gamer pees.
[11963.61s -> 11965.85s]  Dude, I'm such an old man.
[11965.85s -> 11969.55s]  It takes me like two minutes at least to pee.
[11969.55s -> 11971.23s]  My community times my pisses,
[11971.23s -> 11976.94s]  so mine is like around a minute and 12, I think.
[11976.94s -> 11978.36s]  One 12.
[11978.36s -> 11979.70s]  Yeah, I am.
[11979.70s -> 11981.66s]  It's a little bit faster than my 500
[11981.66s -> 11987.70s]  on the rowing machine.
[11987.70s -> 11988.58s]  Rowing machine?
[11988.58s -> 11990.43s]  All right.
[11990.43s -> 11991.71s]  Jeremy, you work out, right?
[11991.71s -> 11992.75s]  Right, go piss, go piss.
[11992.75s -> 11993.59s]  I used to.
[11993.59s -> 11994.79s]  All right, I'm not going to mute.
[11995.55s -> 11997.11s]  I'm not going to mute this call,
[11997.11s -> 11999.15s]  so make sure you behave, please.
[11999.15s -> 11999.99s]  Sponsor stream.
[11999.99s -> 12003.54s]  Okay, I'm going to say so many gamer words right now.
[12003.54s -> 12008.40s]  You dare.
[12008.40s -> 12010.36s]  79 seconds last time, good looks champ.
[12010.36s -> 12011.20s]  You got it.
[12011.20s -> 12014.06s]  Oh, by the way, chat,
[12014.06s -> 12018.26s]  I completely nailed it on the Tucker Carlson thing
[12018.26s -> 12023.70s]  that I said he was going to say.
[12023.70s -> 12025.58s]  Apparently his segment came out
[12025.58s -> 12029.68s]  and it's identical to what I said he was going to say.
[12029.68s -> 12037.99s]  Yeah.
[12037.99s -> 12040.93s]  Even with the Sandy Cortez lock, that's crazy.
[12040.93s -> 12129.70s]  Oh wait, I should mute myself.
[12161.58s -> 12162.62s]  All right, I'm back.
[12167.31s -> 12168.27s]  How's everybody doing?
[12168.27s -> 12176.15s]  Everybody just chilling?
[12176.15s -> 12182.34s]  We good?
[12182.34s -> 12184.50s]  No, but seriously, honestly, seriously,
[12184.50s -> 12187.25s]  let me just say the same thing three times.
[12187.25s -> 12188.21s]  Warner Brothers Interactive,
[12188.21s -> 12191.51s]  thanks for sponsoring the stream.
[12191.51s -> 12193.07s]  The ad segment, I guess, is kind of over,
[12193.07s -> 12194.51s]  but we're still playing.
[12194.51s -> 12196.43s]  This is really fun, really cool opportunity.
[12196.43s -> 12198.94s]  I'm really happy to play it.
[12198.94s -> 12203.56s]  The game is great.
[12203.56s -> 12206.52s]  Again, I'll say it one more time.
[12206.52s -> 12210.92s]  It's free to play.
[12210.92s -> 12214.01s]  It's got tons of cool characters.
[12214.01s -> 12217.19s]  If you're watching and you have drops enabled,
[12217.19s -> 12220.10s]  it's kind of this early access period.
[12220.10s -> 12223.79s]  July 26th, it goes into open beta,
[12223.79s -> 12227.74s]  actually open open beta and get it on anything.
[12227.74s -> 12230.74s]  PlayStation, Xbox, PC, full cross compatibility,
[12230.74s -> 12234.37s]  cross progression.
[12234.37s -> 12236.01s]  You can play wherever.
[12242.20s -> 12243.24s]  People are going to think I'm a weirdo
[12243.24s -> 12246.32s]  when this comes over here.
[12246.32s -> 12248.52s]  I mean, it's kind of weird what I'm doing, but whatever.
[12248.52s -> 12259.58s]  I didn't have any clean cups.
[12259.58s -> 12263.55s]  Wait, what does Hassan do?
[12263.55s -> 12266.07s]  Hey, you were, what, you here?
[12266.07s -> 12267.30s]  How are we doing?
[12267.30s -> 12268.86s]  I'm here.
[12268.86s -> 12271.34s]  I'm just doing a little bit of politics,
[12274.20s -> 12275.60s]  having some fun.
[12275.60s -> 12277.00s]  I muted myself, don't worry.
[12277.00s -> 12280.00s]  I did not radicalize the Germaniacs.
[12280.00s -> 12281.20s]  Excuse me.
[12282.96s -> 12284.92s]  They're not the Germaniacs.
[12284.92s -> 12286.72s]  Fuck, what were they, the germaphobes?
[12286.72s -> 12288.44s]  The germamites.
[12288.44s -> 12293.30s]  The germamites, damn it, okay.
[12293.30s -> 12296.43s]  Now, do you think, I think Ludwig is probably
[12296.43s -> 12312.93s]  putting holes in his drywall, looking for a chord.
[12312.93s -> 12314.09s]  Okay, that looks good.
[12316.86s -> 12319.35s]  Hello.
[12319.71s -> 12322.35s]  I mean, it's kind of weird what I'm doing, but whatever.
[12322.35s -> 12324.31s]  Jeremy, you want to, you want to one we've honored,
[12324.31s -> 12325.31s]  one v one?
[12325.31s -> 12326.15s]  I don't know, you know what I'm saying?
[12326.15s -> 12326.99s]  We can one v one.
[12326.99s -> 12327.83s]  While we wait.
[12327.83s -> 12331.06s]  You want to just invite me?
[12331.06s -> 12336.30s]  Yeah.
[12336.30s -> 12337.98s]  I'm drinking it out of the pitcher.
[12337.98s -> 12340.18s]  Let me finish this fire tweet.
[12340.18s -> 12341.90s]  You got a good tweet?
[12341.90s -> 12346.83s]  Well, I just, you watch Tucker Carlson?
[12346.83s -> 12348.99s]  Are you familiar with his rhetoric?
[12348.99s -> 12351.27s]  I'm familiar with the man, Tucker Carlson.
[12351.27s -> 12352.43s]  Yeah.
[12352.43s -> 12354.59s]  Well, earlier today, someone in the chat asked me
[12354.59s -> 12355.83s]  what Tucker Carlson is going to say
[12355.83s -> 12358.83s]  about AOC getting arrested at Capitol Hill
[12358.83s -> 12361.51s]  for protesting outside of the Supreme Court
[12361.51s -> 12363.03s]  or the United States.
[12363.03s -> 12368.21s]  And I basically nailed, I mean, nailed his exact speech.
[12368.98s -> 12369.82s]  Word for word?
[12369.82s -> 12371.78s]  With like one minor exception, not word for word,
[12371.78s -> 12374.22s]  but down to like the psychotic joker laugh
[12374.22s -> 12376.31s]  that he was going to do.
[12376.31s -> 12378.67s]  There was a joker laugh involved?
[12378.67s -> 12379.59s]  Yeah.
[12379.59s -> 12387.77s]  He likes to do joker laughs.
[12387.77s -> 12390.01s]  You want to, let's one v one.
[12390.01s -> 12394.02s]  Okay, let's do it.
[12394.02s -> 12395.78s]  I need an invite.
[12395.78s -> 12398.68s]  Hold on.
[12398.68s -> 12401.92s]  Okay, let's do another lobby, custom lobby.
[12401.92s -> 12406.10s]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[12406.10s -> 12407.74s]  I got a picture of ice cold water.
[12417.02s -> 12418.70s]  No, I don't want to drink it on camera
[12418.70s -> 12420.42s]  because it's like really bright glass
[12420.42s -> 12421.78s]  and it's going to like reflect off the screen
[12421.78s -> 12423.58s]  and show my dick.
[12423.58s -> 12435.45s]  I just invited you.
[12435.45s -> 12439.13s]  Dude, I just said something so crazy that the chat froze
[12439.13s -> 12442.45s]  because people just spammed question marks.
[12442.45s -> 12443.69s]  What did you say?
[12443.69s -> 12444.53s]  I talked about it like that.
[12444.53s -> 12445.37s]  Oh, your dick?
[12445.37s -> 12448.86s]  I just said the word dick and everybody freaked out.
[12449.38s -> 12450.34s]  The chat actually broke.
[12450.34s -> 12451.98s]  It stopped functioning for like three or four
[12451.98s -> 12453.99s]  straight seconds.
[12453.99s -> 12457.77s]  It happens, dude.
[12457.77s -> 12460.73s]  Okay, we're, we're doing, should we do two v two
[12460.73s -> 12463.74s]  against people or should we do a one v one?
[12463.74s -> 12466.52s]  Oh wait, he's back.
[12466.52s -> 12468.54s]  Where's Charlie?
[12468.54s -> 12470.10s]  I think he's hanging out.
[12470.10s -> 12470.94s]  Yeah, I'm here.
[12470.94s -> 12471.90s]  I'm ready.
[12471.90s -> 12477.67s]  Okay, everything works with one weird exception.
[12477.67s -> 12479.27s]  Jeremy, you got to leave again, I think.
[12479.27s -> 12480.11s]  Oh, okay.
[12480.11s -> 12482.22s]  So that I can, so I can,
[12482.22s -> 12484.46s]  cause I don't know how to put you back in the,
[12484.46s -> 12485.54s]  in my lobby.
[12485.54s -> 12487.22s]  Oh wait, I'll just remove you.
[12487.22s -> 12488.74s]  I can leave.
[12488.74s -> 12489.78s]  Wait, wait, here, hold on.
[12489.78s -> 12497.70s]  And I'm going to add you again.
[12497.70s -> 12499.62s]  Oh, if me and Ludd are going to do one v one
[12499.62s -> 12501.02s]  in free for all, and you guys are going to watch,
[12501.02s -> 12503.18s]  it doesn't really matter what team you're in, right?
[12503.18s -> 12504.26s]  No.
[12504.26s -> 12505.94s]  Did you get a controller?
[12505.94s -> 12506.78s]  Yeah, we're not going to do two v two.
[12506.78s -> 12507.74s]  I got a controller.
[12507.74s -> 12508.70s]  Oh hell yeah.
[12508.70s -> 12511.86s]  Only weird thing is it has a insane amount of lag,
[12511.86s -> 12513.54s]  but you know, I'm sure that's fine.
[12513.54s -> 12515.22s]  What kind of controller is it?
[12515.22s -> 12517.81s]  Xbox.
[12517.81s -> 12520.62s]  Xbox one, Xbox 360.
[12520.62s -> 12522.90s]  Ludd, you have to, you have to accept my friend request
[12522.90s -> 12526.74s]  on your, on your Warner Brothers like account or whatever.
[12526.74s -> 12527.58s]  I refuse.
[12527.58s -> 12531.80s]  And moist, I added you as well.
[12531.80s -> 12539.50s]  I'll be there in just one sec.
[12539.50s -> 12564.78s]  Oh here, I just added, I just sent you an invite.
[12564.78s -> 12565.62s]  Put down the picture.
[12565.62s -> 12569.31s]  I almost saw it monkey, whatever.
[12569.31s -> 12571.11s]  Can you imagine like a reflection off the screen,
[12571.11s -> 12574.62s]  off this and like, just me naked.
[12574.62s -> 12575.90s]  Are you?
[12575.90s -> 12577.42s]  No.
[12577.42s -> 12579.86s]  Hassan, you friended me, smiley face?
[12579.86s -> 12581.38s]  I did.
[12581.38s -> 12584.26s]  The only time where we actually, you know,
[12584.26s -> 12585.34s]  you should be in your friend advice,
[12585.34s -> 12590.71s]  but you probably have a lot right now.
[12590.71s -> 12594.03s]  But I also sent you an invite to the game.
[12594.03s -> 12598.44s]  How do I scroll through?
[12598.44s -> 12602.58s]  This is the only time where we're friends.
[12602.58s -> 12606.73s]  I like the mystery machine profile picture Ludwig.
[12606.73s -> 12610.01s]  Yeah, that's, it's cause I love Scooby, but also do.
[12614.85s -> 12617.81s]  What's new Scooby Doo coming after you?
[12617.81s -> 12622.18s]  Gonna find that mystery.
[12622.18s -> 12626.03s]  What's new Scooby Doo?
[12626.03s -> 12629.98s]  Isn't it Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
[12629.98s -> 12632.02s]  I'm referring to the other, the newer one.
[12632.86s -> 12636.38s]  We got some, I never was a big Scooby Doo fan.
[12636.38s -> 12637.62s]  Are we waiting on big man?
[12637.62s -> 12639.68s]  Yeah.
[12639.68s -> 12640.52s]  I always thought that Scooby Doo
[12640.52s -> 12643.34s]  would be a great serial character.
[12643.34s -> 12646.87s]  Why are my fucking things showing?
[12646.87s -> 12649.55s]  I already, I thought I shut it off.
[12649.55s -> 12651.83s]  Scooby Snacks would just be a great serial.
[12651.83s -> 12652.67s]  They should have just made Scooby Snacks
[12652.67s -> 12653.83s]  and they would do two commercials.
[12653.83s -> 12655.15s]  He would be the coolest one out of all of them.
[12655.15s -> 12661.25s]  He would kick the shit out of Tony the Tiger.
[12661.25s -> 12662.49s]  Scooby Snack cereal?
[12662.49s -> 12664.05s]  People are saying they already did that.
[12664.05s -> 12666.57s]  There are multiple Scooby universes.
[12666.57s -> 12668.01s]  Yeah, but it was a limited time probably thing.
[12668.45s -> 12674.90s]  It's not like Tony the Tiger presents Frosted Flakes.
[12674.90s -> 12677.26s]  Yeah, I don't know why I'm getting party invites nonstop.
[12677.26s -> 12679.54s]  I thought I ended the.
[12679.54s -> 12681.38s]  If you go into your settings, the left side.
[12681.38s -> 12682.22s]  I did.
[12682.22s -> 12683.24s]  Oh, you did?
[12683.24s -> 12684.12s]  I did that already.
[12684.12s -> 12685.60s]  Yeah, party invites from friends only.
[12685.60s -> 12688.38s]  Oh, okay, I should do that.
[12688.38s -> 12693.55s]  Show friend invite notifications, I turned off.
[12693.55s -> 12695.39s]  I guess party invites from friends only.
[12695.39s -> 12697.56s]  I'm ready.
[12697.56s -> 12702.78s]  All right, I invited you again.
[12702.78s -> 12708.60s]  They have Scooby Snack cookies?
[12708.60s -> 12710.70s]  That's probably, why do I feel like
[12710.98s -> 12714.74s]  you're making this up and I'm gonna go buy dog biscuits?
[12714.74s -> 12715.94s]  This is not right.
[12715.94s -> 12717.26s]  Well, I mean, if they're dog biscuits,
[12717.26s -> 12718.22s]  doesn't that make it real?
[12718.22s -> 12720.02s]  Actually, Scooby-Doo eats a lot of human food,
[12720.02s -> 12721.86s]  which is bad, it's not good.
[12723.30s -> 12724.74s]  It's like a bunch of scubs and shit
[12724.74s -> 12726.58s]  with like garlic and onions on it.
[12726.58s -> 12727.74s]  Your dog will start baking.
[12727.74s -> 12728.58s]  That's right.
[12728.58s -> 12730.74s]  I heard you weren't a cat person until recently
[12730.74s -> 12732.90s]  and now you have toxoplasmosis.
[12732.90s -> 12734.42s]  That's fucked up.
[12734.42s -> 12735.26s]  Is that true?
[12735.26s -> 12736.26s]  What?
[12736.26s -> 12738.86s]  Well, I don't have toxoplasmosis,
[12738.86s -> 12742.51s]  but I have become more of a cat person.
[12742.51s -> 12743.99s]  Interesting.
[12743.99s -> 12744.83s]  Okay.
[12744.83s -> 12747.31s]  Where's the toxoplasmosis thing coming from?
[12749.82s -> 12752.63s]  Toxoplasmosis is when you like,
[12752.63s -> 12755.59s]  it's just like cat poop makes you love your cat
[12755.59s -> 12758.03s]  and become like servile to your cat.
[12758.03s -> 12759.83s]  Yeah, like brainwashed.
[12759.83s -> 12765.17s]  I thought it was nothing that makes you take more risks.
[12765.17s -> 12766.65s]  I don't know about that.
[12766.65s -> 12768.41s]  I don't have it is something that someone
[12768.41s -> 12775.09s]  with toxoplasmosis would say though, for sure.
[12775.09s -> 12775.93s]  Anyway.
[12778.16s -> 12779.00s]  I don't know.
[12779.00s -> 12781.20s]  We'll see if the new game Stray that came out,
[12781.20s -> 12783.56s]  if that'll make me love cats.
[12783.56s -> 12784.80s]  Everybody's playing that.
[12784.80s -> 12785.64s]  Is it cool?
[12785.64s -> 12788.03s]  It looks pretty cool.
[12788.03s -> 12788.99s]  A cat simulator game.
[12788.99s -> 12789.83s]  It looks cool.
[12789.83s -> 12791.69s]  Are you not a cat person, Asan?
[12791.69s -> 12794.33s]  I mean, I'm not like a huge cat person.
[12794.33s -> 12795.37s]  I like kittens,
[12795.37s -> 12797.89s]  but I do think that cats are too like hot and cold for me.
[12797.89s -> 12798.73s]  You know what I mean?
[12798.73s -> 12800.57s]  I like the companion,
[12800.57s -> 12803.77s]  like the lifelong companionship of a dog more than...
[12803.77s -> 12806.74s]  Superpowers Batman.
[12806.74s -> 12809.58s]  So are we doing a just free brawl?
[12809.58s -> 12810.42s]  Oh my God.
[12810.42s -> 12811.26s]  I don't know.
[12811.26s -> 12812.10s]  Is it a 1v1?
[12812.10s -> 12812.94s]  Was it 1v1?
[12812.94s -> 12814.64s]  All right.
[12814.64s -> 12815.48s]  Okay.
[12815.48s -> 12833.25s]  Well, get me away from that edge.
[12833.25s -> 12836.42s]  Shit.
[12836.42s -> 12838.75s]  Oh God.
[12838.75s -> 12840.07s]  How did you even die?
[12840.07s -> 12843.15s]  There was no, nobody attacked you.
[12843.15s -> 12845.95s]  My control is on Bluetooth and has three second latency.
[12845.95s -> 12847.27s]  You're on a Bluetooth?
[12848.81s -> 12850.21s]  Jerm, it's been a rough day for me.
[12850.21s -> 12851.53s]  Oh my goodness.
[12851.53s -> 12852.89s]  Yeah, dude, imagine getting owned by me.
[12852.89s -> 12854.37s]  That's fucking really rough, dude.
[12854.37s -> 12855.21s]  All right.
[12855.21s -> 12856.69s]  Come on, man.
[12856.69s -> 12858.01s]  You survived.
[12858.01s -> 12859.25s]  I don't know how.
[12859.25s -> 12874.08s]  Blocking in this game?
[12874.08s -> 12874.92s]  Just dodging.
[12874.92s -> 12875.92s]  So perfect dodge.
[12878.83s -> 12880.07s]  Oh.
[12880.07s -> 12882.19s]  Oh, can I get the follow up?
[12882.19s -> 12883.59s]  Can I get the follow up?
[12883.59s -> 12888.51s]  Can I get the follow up?
[12888.51s -> 12889.77s]  Shit.
[12889.77s -> 12890.61s]  I needed that.
[12890.61s -> 12891.43s]  I needed that bad.
[12891.43s -> 12896.66s]  I needed that so bad.
[12896.66s -> 12897.50s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[12897.50s -> 12898.34s]  I'm so dead.
[12898.34s -> 12899.82s]  Oh, slide with the edgeguard.
[12899.82s -> 12901.57s]  I can't.
[12901.57s -> 12902.97s]  Oh, I couldn't get back.
[12907.93s -> 12908.77s]  Oh.
[12908.77s -> 12909.61s]  Well done.
[12909.61s -> 12910.82s]  Well done.
[12910.82s -> 12911.66s]  Wait, was that me?
[12911.66s -> 12912.48s]  Did you ring out?
[12912.48s -> 12913.32s]  Okay.
[12923.75s -> 12926.47s]  I'm having a rough game right now, boys.
[12928.83s -> 12929.67s]  What do you mean?
[12929.67s -> 12930.49s]  Aren't you?
[12930.49s -> 12931.35s]  Oh no, it's actually, oh shit.
[12931.35s -> 12932.39s]  Jerm was killing it.
[12932.39s -> 12934.31s]  Yeah, Jerm was going nuts.
[12934.31s -> 12935.47s]  I drank a pitcher of water.
[12935.47s -> 12936.31s]  I'm bad.
[12936.31s -> 12937.13s]  Wait, that double ring out was you?
[12937.13s -> 12938.15s]  I thought that was me.
[12949.53s -> 12954.96s]  Oh.
[12957.60s -> 12958.72s]  Oh, did I take it at the end?
[12958.72s -> 12959.64s]  Oh no.
[12959.64s -> 12960.92s]  That was close.
[12960.92s -> 12962.60s]  Yeah, it was close.
[12963.40s -> 12967.49s]  Where's my, where's my, oh.
[12967.49s -> 12968.33s]  GG, GG.
[12968.33s -> 12969.17s]  Good shit, Jerma.
[12969.17s -> 12969.99s]  Congratulations.
[12969.99s -> 12970.83s]  Good work.
[12970.83s -> 12972.61s]  It's the first free-for-all I think I've won today.
[12972.61s -> 12974.57s]  You know, congratulations on kill stealing
[12974.57s -> 12975.41s]  the entire game.
[12975.41s -> 12976.23s]  It's fine.
[12976.23s -> 12977.07s]  I mean, not a big deal.
[12977.07s -> 12977.91s]  Top damage.
[12979.89s -> 12980.85s]  Whatever.
[12980.85s -> 12985.57s]  Ludwig, you good?
[12985.57s -> 12989.97s]  Are you there?
[12989.97s -> 12992.81s]  I think steam is coming out of his ears.
[12992.81s -> 12993.65s]  Are you there, dude?
[12993.65s -> 12994.47s]  Are you okay?
[12998.95s -> 13000.79s]  Stop talking to me, man.
[13000.79s -> 13003.19s]  So you guys want to do your 1v1
[13004.07s -> 13004.91s]  or do you want to keep doing free-for-all?
[13004.91s -> 13005.75s]  What do you guys want to do?
[13005.75s -> 13006.95s]  Are you, are you okay with doing a 1v1
[13006.95s -> 13010.24s]  or what's happening?
[13010.24s -> 13013.12s]  He's looking at his controller furiously.
[13013.12s -> 13016.03s]  I just found a new one.
[13016.03s -> 13017.03s]  Okay.
[13017.03s -> 13019.50s]  Let's shoot out a free-for-all.
[13023.18s -> 13025.38s]  Do you get banned from like all the Smash tournaments
[13025.38s -> 13028.02s]  going forward if you get owned so mercilessly
[13028.02s -> 13032.19s]  by like someone as bad as me?
[13032.19s -> 13036.79s]  Like, how does that work?
[13036.79s -> 13037.75s]  Damn, Lud is just hitting you
[13037.75s -> 13039.63s]  with a cold shoulder real hard right now.
[13039.63s -> 13041.13s]  I think he's going to punch you.
[13041.13s -> 13041.97s]  Yeah.
[13041.97s -> 13042.81s]  This sounds like it's about to be
[13042.81s -> 13043.91s]  like a schoolyard fight here.
[13045.15s -> 13050.58s]  Oh no.
[13050.58s -> 13052.38s]  Oh, that's, that was definitely a bunch of batteries
[13052.38s -> 13053.22s]  that just fell.
[13053.22s -> 13054.06s]  This is bullying and bannable.
[13054.06s -> 13054.90s]  Dude, I'm just taking out,
[13054.90s -> 13056.54s]  I'm just taking out all my frustrations
[13056.54s -> 13058.86s]  because I asked Lud to come with me to the UK
[13058.86s -> 13061.26s]  and potentially Amsterdam.
[13061.26s -> 13064.50s]  And he was just like, yeah, just ask Cutie.
[13064.50s -> 13066.06s]  Wait, he left the lobby again?
[13066.06s -> 13067.50s]  Dude, it sounded like he was rolling dice
[13067.50s -> 13068.60s]  for damage to you.
[13074.20s -> 13078.74s]  Oh no.
[13078.74s -> 13080.38s]  Demand and everything everywhere all at once.
[13080.38s -> 13081.62s]  Moist meter from Charlie.
[13081.62s -> 13083.66s]  Why?
[13083.66s -> 13084.92s]  Oh, I still haven't watched that movie.
[13085.76s -> 13086.92s]  Dude, it's so good.
[13086.92s -> 13089.02s]  Not to, not to impact the integrity of the moist meter,
[13089.02s -> 13090.22s]  but it was brilliant.
[13090.22s -> 13091.16s]  It was great.
[13091.16s -> 13093.12s]  I've heard nothing but good things about that movie.
[13093.12s -> 13093.96s]  It looks good.
[13093.96s -> 13095.36s]  I just never saw it in theater
[13095.36s -> 13097.84s]  and I still haven't watched it on streaming.
[13097.84s -> 13098.66s]  Yeah.
[13098.66s -> 13099.80s]  What about the Black Phone?
[13099.80s -> 13101.08s]  I heard that's really good too.
[13101.08s -> 13102.20s]  I missed that one as well.
[13102.20s -> 13104.60s]  That one also came out when I couldn't go to a theater.
[13104.60s -> 13105.56s]  Wait, you thought that was good?
[13105.56s -> 13108.20s]  I heard that, I heard, I don't think Will liked it.
[13108.20s -> 13110.48s]  And Will is like my go-to for horror movies.
[13110.48s -> 13113.72s]  I haven't seen it.
[13113.72s -> 13114.80s]  It's got pretty good reviews.
[13114.80s -> 13116.24s]  The audience score is pretty good too.
[13116.24s -> 13117.66s]  I don't know.
[13117.66s -> 13119.10s]  It's pretty positively received,
[13119.10s -> 13120.66s]  especially for a horror movie.
[13120.66s -> 13123.14s]  Wait, Charlie, did you watch RRR?
[13123.14s -> 13124.62s]  No, I love Bollywood though,
[13124.62s -> 13125.46s]  so I'm definitely gonna watch it.
[13125.46s -> 13126.70s]  Movie of the summer, movie of the summer.
[13126.70s -> 13128.10s]  Well, if you already like Bollywood,
[13128.10s -> 13130.40s]  you're gonna fucking flip.
[13130.40s -> 13131.24s]  Oh, good.
[13131.24s -> 13132.06s]  I'm excited.
[13132.06s -> 13132.90s]  I've seen the clips on Twitter.
[13132.90s -> 13133.74s]  They're so hype with like the tigers.
[13133.74s -> 13135.74s]  Dude, it is so dumb.
[13135.74s -> 13136.86s]  It's so good.
[13136.86s -> 13138.22s]  It's so fucking good.
[13138.22s -> 13139.06s]  It was bad.
[13139.06s -> 13140.54s]  I think, really?
[13140.54s -> 13142.42s]  Yeah, no, it looks really good, Jerma.
[13142.42s -> 13143.68s]  Do you watch Bollywood at all, Jerma?
[13143.68s -> 13144.52s]  I feel like you'd be a big fan.
[13144.52s -> 13145.36s]  Oh, no, sorry.
[13146.04s -> 13147.84s]  People are saying that Black Phone was bad.
[13147.84s -> 13151.59s]  No, I feel like I would love Bollywood films.
[13151.59s -> 13153.03s]  Yeah, they're right up your alley.
[13153.03s -> 13155.55s]  I feel like something like Gentleman or something
[13155.55s -> 13156.55s]  is so good.
[13156.55s -> 13158.55s]  It's iconic.
[13158.55s -> 13160.75s]  Give me a list of your top five.
[13160.75s -> 13162.22s]  I'll watch them.
[13162.22s -> 13163.70s]  Dude, Gentleman.
[13165.70s -> 13166.54s]  Or top three.
[13167.74s -> 13169.42s]  I think Gentleman, and then there's,
[13169.42s -> 13171.14s]  what's the one with, this one's for Chad.
[13171.14s -> 13174.06s]  The one where the bad guy has a bunch of clones
[13174.06s -> 13176.62s]  and they all form a giant cube, a giant sphere.
[13176.62s -> 13177.72s]  What?
[13178.56s -> 13179.40s]  It's so cool.
[13179.40s -> 13180.22s]  I can never remember the name of it.
[13180.22s -> 13181.06s]  Is it Singham?
[13181.06s -> 13181.90s]  Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[13181.90s -> 13183.44s]  Well, they all get, all the cops get together
[13183.44s -> 13185.48s]  and they become like a giant human cube
[13185.48s -> 13187.08s]  and they start like rolling through town
[13187.08s -> 13188.44s]  like Katamari Damasi.
[13188.44s -> 13189.28s]  It's amazing.
[13189.28s -> 13190.60s]  That movie is, that whole movie is good.
[13190.60s -> 13191.44s]  That's just one scene.
[13191.44s -> 13192.44s]  I can't remember the name of it though.
[13192.44s -> 13193.28s]  Oh my God.
[13193.28s -> 13194.10s]  All right.
[13194.10s -> 13195.31s]  I'm interested.
[13195.31s -> 13198.53s]  People are saying Bahubali Indiran, Indian Terminator.
[13198.53s -> 13199.99s]  Is that what it is?
[13199.99s -> 13200.83s]  Might be.
[13200.83s -> 13201.87s]  A lot of people are saying robot
[13201.87s -> 13203.15s]  and I think that's the one.
[13203.15s -> 13204.63s]  I think it's robot.
[13204.63s -> 13208.22s]  Hey, can I get a quick invite, guys?
[13208.22s -> 13213.42s]  Your ELO level's too low, I think, unfortunately.
[13213.42s -> 13214.50s]  Your ELO level.
[13214.50s -> 13216.44s]  Isn't that, that's not what you're supposed to say, right?
[13216.44s -> 13217.28s]  You're supposed to say ELO.
[13217.28s -> 13219.00s]  That's how little of a fucking gamer I am.
[13219.00s -> 13220.84s]  I'm freezing right now, Hassan.
[13220.84s -> 13224.64s]  Here, I just fucking accept my friend request
[13224.64s -> 13226.08s]  so I can easily add you.
[13226.08s -> 13226.98s]  It's getting heated.
[13226.98s -> 13227.82s]  It's getting heated.
[13227.82s -> 13228.66s]  Oh shit.
[13228.66s -> 13229.50s]  Did I do too late to do it?
[13229.50s -> 13230.82s]  All right, give me free.
[13230.82s -> 13231.66s]  Free for all.
[13231.66s -> 13233.46s]  Is this one we want or are we doing just let's play all of it?
[13233.46s -> 13234.30s]  I don't know what I did.
[13234.30s -> 13236.24s]  Good old fashioned free.
[13236.24s -> 13238.50s]  You got it.
[13238.50s -> 13244.68s]  Here, I'll go Superman this time.
[13244.68s -> 13246.80s]  Do you still have latency or are you good now?
[13246.80s -> 13248.80s]  I'm on my third controller.
[13248.80s -> 13250.18s]  It's worked this time.
[13250.18s -> 13251.56s]  Why'd he censored?
[13251.56s -> 13253.80s]  Oh.
[13253.80s -> 13254.88s]  Is it maybe your cable, Ludd?
[13254.88s -> 13257.52s]  Are you using the same cable for every controller?
[13257.52s -> 13261.76s]  I, no, it might be, so it didn't work with cable.
[13261.76s -> 13262.60s]  Oh, it is free.
[13262.60s -> 13263.44s]  It only worked with Bluetooth.
[13263.44s -> 13264.48s]  Oh, gotcha.
[13264.48s -> 13266.84s]  And I tried two controllers and neither worked.
[13266.84s -> 13269.08s]  So I just called it quits after a while.
[13269.08s -> 13272.41s]  Well, then I found a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.
[13272.41s -> 13275.61s]  Oh, that, I love the Pro Controller.
[13275.61s -> 13276.81s]  I think it's a Pro one.
[13279.24s -> 13282.59s]  And here on, and here on.
[13282.59s -> 13284.83s]  That's the one with the forming the giant.
[13284.83s -> 13285.75s]  That's what she's not saying at least.
[13285.75s -> 13286.59s]  I don't know.
[13286.59s -> 13287.43s]  Okay.
[13287.43s -> 13288.25s]  That's the one?
[13288.25s -> 13289.09s]  Yeah, that one is amazing.
[13289.09s -> 13292.77s]  And then another great one is Sing Am.
[13292.77s -> 13296.17s]  Ludd, I have a recommendation for the controller thing.
[13296.17s -> 13300.02s]  Like I have a fix.
[13300.02s -> 13301.20s]  Ludd.
[13301.20s -> 13303.00s]  You versus me again, Clark.
[13303.00s -> 13304.84s]  He's dialed in his sign.
[13304.84s -> 13305.68s]  Is he not talking to me?
[13305.68s -> 13306.50s]  Like, what's going on?
[13306.50s -> 13307.42s]  Is he like actually mad at me?
[13307.42s -> 13308.52s]  I don't understand.
[13308.52s -> 13310.48s]  It's called, it's called getting good
[13310.48s -> 13311.64s]  and not dying like that.
[13311.64s -> 13313.68s]  You just did the way you died just now.
[13321.35s -> 13322.55s]  I have not landed a hit right now.
[13322.55s -> 13325.69s]  I am getting absolutely worked.
[13325.69s -> 13332.90s]  Oh, that was a good pickup.
[13332.90s -> 13335.12s]  You know, I really appreciate being able to grab the wall
[13335.12s -> 13336.84s]  because I would have died a thousand more times
[13336.84s -> 13338.32s]  than I already have.
[13338.32s -> 13339.16s]  Yeah, that's huge.
[13339.16s -> 13344.70s]  It's crucial.
[13344.70s -> 13345.54s]  Oh shit.
[13354.24s -> 13355.08s]  Oh.
[13371.06s -> 13372.68s]  Oh.
[13372.72s -> 13375.44s]  I got you with that last hit there.
[13375.44s -> 13376.84s]  That was a good wall up.
[13396.27s -> 13399.03s]  Ludwig, Ludwig, incredible, brilliant technique.
[13404.47s -> 13405.51s]  Oh, fuck you, dude.
[13405.51s -> 13406.35s]  I needed that.
[13409.17s -> 13410.61s]  Trying to get the, the,
[13410.61s -> 13412.81s]  the blow the kiss thing is hard to land.
[13412.81s -> 13413.81s]  Yeah.
[13413.81s -> 13415.21s]  It's good though, when you do.
[13428.37s -> 13429.77s]  Wait, who got the ring out?
[13431.77s -> 13433.81s]  I think it was Jerma.
[13433.81s -> 13434.81s]  What the fuck?
[13434.85s -> 13437.17s]  Jerma is cracked, bro.
[13437.17s -> 13439.65s]  Yeah, Jerma is going nuts.
[13439.65s -> 13443.09s]  Sometimes, sometimes when I'm, when I lock in,
[13443.09s -> 13445.45s]  I pretend to be a gamer for an hour or so.
[13448.61s -> 13449.45s]  Oh no.
[13450.61s -> 13452.77s]  Oh, the, what, the screen is closing in.
[13452.77s -> 13453.97s]  Holy shit.
[13453.97s -> 13455.37s]  What the fuck?
[13455.37s -> 13456.37s]  Dude, this is insane.
[13456.37s -> 13458.61s]  The screen, I didn't know that.
[13458.61s -> 13461.21s]  I just lost, I had it and I lost it big time.
[13461.21s -> 13464.26s]  I got like kicked out.
[13464.50s -> 13465.98s]  That's a pretty funny feature.
[13465.98s -> 13466.82s]  You actually, the screen.
[13466.82s -> 13467.70s]  Wait, where should I put the camera?
[13467.70s -> 13470.02s]  Where are you guys putting the camera?
[13470.02s -> 13471.66s]  I did bottom left.
[13471.66s -> 13478.02s]  Holy shit, Lud.
[13478.02s -> 13479.42s]  Okay, one second, one second.
[13479.42s -> 13481.61s]  Hey man, it's.
[13481.61s -> 13482.45s]  It's all right.
[13482.45s -> 13483.29s]  It's okay.
[13483.29s -> 13484.13s]  It's okay.
[13484.13s -> 13486.22s]  It's all right, what, it's.
[13486.22s -> 13501.02s]  It is, yeah, no, you're, you're doing great.
[13501.02s -> 13504.06s]  More thief, more free.
[13504.06s -> 13505.10s]  More free for all?
[13505.10s -> 13506.66s]  Yeah, you can, you can run some more thief
[13506.66s -> 13507.78s]  while we wait for him.
[13511.75s -> 13512.59s]  No.
[13512.59s -> 13513.79s]  Choose your character.
[13513.79s -> 13515.83s]  Dude, how much water is in a pitcher of water?
[13515.83s -> 13520.13s]  That's like 60 ounces or whatever this is.
[13520.13s -> 13520.97s]  Excuse me, what?
[13520.97s -> 13522.21s]  Nevermind.
[13522.21s -> 13524.41s]  Everyone forget I said anything.
[13524.41s -> 13527.12s]  How much water is in this, do you think?
[13527.12s -> 13529.64s]  Like how much, how much water do you think is in this?
[13529.64s -> 13531.34s]  Like 60 ounces?
[13531.34s -> 13533.34s]  Yeah, yeah.
[13533.34s -> 13537.70s]  Wait, Ludwig left again.
[13537.70s -> 13538.74s]  Send me another invite as well.
[13538.74s -> 13541.74s]  I'm gonna restart my game real quick.
[13541.74s -> 13542.70s]  All right, I'll remove you.
[13542.70s -> 13546.37s]  Ludwig keeps leaving.
[13546.37s -> 13547.25s]  Why are you drinking out of a pitcher?
[13547.25s -> 13560.67s]  Because I, I don't, I don't have any clean cups.
[13560.67s -> 13568.75s]  Earwigs are eating his grave matter again.
[13568.75s -> 13569.91s]  Do your dishes?
[13569.91s -> 13584.27s]  Dude, they're all in the dishwasher.
[13584.27s -> 13585.35s]  Holly and I have been sick,
[13585.35s -> 13592.70s]  so we just ran a dishwasher and it is,
[13592.70s -> 13594.66s]  this is not a vase for a flower, dude.
[13594.66s -> 13606.23s]  It's a, it's a pitcher.
[13606.23s -> 13607.63s]  You're too sick to press a button.
[13607.63s -> 13608.59s]  I just told you that everything's
[13608.59s -> 13614.12s]  in the dishwasher right now.
[13614.12s -> 13616.20s]  No, I didn't shit in the dishwasher.
[13616.20s -> 13621.64s]  It's tying people up for saying that.
[13621.64s -> 13623.44s]  Why would I do, I'm gonna like do a shit
[13623.44s -> 13626.56s]  in the dishwasher prank thing to my own dishwasher.
[13626.56s -> 13627.48s]  What are you talking about?
[13627.48s -> 13629.64s]  Dude, what are you saying right now, Jerma?
[13629.64s -> 13630.48s]  What is happening on your stream?
[13630.48s -> 13634.14s]  I'm fighting, my chat is, has lost their mind.
[13634.14s -> 13635.38s]  They keep talking about how I've,
[13635.38s -> 13638.08s]  you heard me, I didn't just repeat it.
[13638.08s -> 13640.97s]  Yeah, shit in a dishwasher prank?
[13640.97s -> 13642.97s]  They're saying, they're saying that like I did that
[13642.97s -> 13649.41s]  and it's making me very upset.
[13649.41s -> 13659.32s]  It was one guy.
[13659.32s -> 13660.68s]  What's that on stream losing to you,
[13660.68s -> 13662.00s]  put him in a mental crisis?
[13662.00s -> 13665.56s]  Oh no.
[13665.56s -> 13668.64s]  We gotta get Ludwig a wired controller
[13668.64s -> 13669.96s]  that has point zero milliseconds.
[13669.96s -> 13671.96s]  Someone in my TTS just asked,
[13671.96s -> 13673.68s]  Chad, who is Jerma, is he a criminal?
[13673.68s -> 13674.52s]  What do you think, Jerma?
[13674.52s -> 13675.64s]  What's your answer to that?
[13675.64s -> 13678.24s]  I'm just a guy in his late thirties.
[13678.24s -> 13681.02s]  That's exactly what a criminal would say.
[13681.02s -> 13682.88s]  Hey, Hassan, I got a question for you.
[13682.88s -> 13683.72s]  What's up?
[13683.72s -> 13686.12s]  So when you're done, when you're not streaming, right?
[13686.12s -> 13687.46s]  Mm-hmm.
[13687.46s -> 13690.22s]  What do you do for the other,
[13690.22s -> 13693.44s]  how much free time do you think you have after a stream?
[13693.44s -> 13697.66s]  So I just, I stream usually like around eight hours
[13698.34s -> 13699.46s]  at a minimum every day, right?
[13699.46s -> 13700.73s]  Right.
[13700.73s -> 13706.03s]  And I will, before I start streaming, I wake up early,
[13706.83s -> 13711.23s]  I read the news and I throw on, you know, like the NPR,
[13711.23s -> 13714.65s]  the NPR links, like the radio updates.
[13714.65s -> 13715.49s]  You know what I mean?
[13715.49s -> 13716.31s]  Okay.
[13716.31s -> 13717.15s]  It was just like straightforward.
[13717.15s -> 13717.99s]  It's like read it.
[13717.99s -> 13719.41s]  It's like an AP readout basically.
[13719.41s -> 13721.70s]  But after stream.
[13721.70s -> 13722.54s]  What?
[13722.54s -> 13723.86s]  Like after your stream, like when you're done.
[13723.86s -> 13724.90s]  No, no, no, before my stream.
[13724.90s -> 13725.82s]  I'm giving you everything.
[13725.82s -> 13726.66s]  Like in the morning I wake up.
[13726.66s -> 13727.50s]  This is his whole day.
[13727.74s -> 13729.58s]  I get the whole day.
[13729.58s -> 13730.78s]  Yeah, you're getting the full day.
[13730.78s -> 13732.62s]  You asked for it even though you didn't ask
[13732.62s -> 13733.46s]  for the full day.
[13733.46s -> 13734.30s]  Okay.
[13734.30s -> 13735.12s]  That's what I do.
[13735.12s -> 13735.96s]  And then I go work out.
[13735.96s -> 13740.32s]  I train with a trainer and then afterwards I do more reading
[13740.32s -> 13743.73s]  and like get, you know, finish whatever the fuck
[13743.73s -> 13746.10s]  I needed to do, like to be an adult.
[13746.10s -> 13751.24s]  And I start my stream at 11, 11 to usually seven,
[13751.24s -> 13753.64s]  eight, whatever I'm streaming.
[13753.64s -> 13755.88s]  And then afterwards, once I'm done,
[13755.88s -> 13760.03s]  probably watch like anime, movies, eat dinner,
[13760.59s -> 13764.26s]  so that's about an hour or two.
[13764.26s -> 13765.10s]  Yeah.
[13765.10s -> 13766.30s]  And then I go to sleep.
[13766.30s -> 13771.18s]  So you end the stream, you watch like two or three episodes
[13771.18s -> 13774.02s]  of anime, eat and then go to sleep.
[13774.02s -> 13774.86s]  Not two or three.
[13774.86s -> 13778.38s]  I watch a lot of like movies and shit too.
[13778.38s -> 13779.78s]  So you're watching probably, let's say.
[13779.78s -> 13780.62s]  Very routine.
[13780.62s -> 13782.59s]  Four or five movies a day?
[13782.59s -> 13784.37s]  No, no, no, no.
[13784.37s -> 13786.45s]  So what are you doing with that other time then?
[13786.45s -> 13787.29s]  I don't know.
[13787.29s -> 13789.09s]  I just like, I literally just chill.
[13789.09s -> 13793.30s]  I, like I said, I eat dinner, I watch some movies,
[13793.30s -> 13795.54s]  I watch some anime and then I go to sleep.
[13795.54s -> 13796.38s]  God damn it.
[13796.38s -> 13798.54s]  It sounds so fucking bad when I just go to sleep.
[13798.54s -> 13799.82s]  Yeah, it was actually kind of sad.
[13799.82s -> 13802.10s]  Like I was just on the sidelines listening and feeling bad.
[13802.10s -> 13802.94s]  But my point-
[13802.94s -> 13803.78s]  Holy fuck.
[13803.78s -> 13805.34s]  Okay, I do a lot of cool stuff.
[13805.34s -> 13807.06s]  Yeah, but you can't even explain it, right?
[13807.06s -> 13808.16s]  I have sex with women.
[13808.16s -> 13809.16s]  Yeah, but you can't explain it.
[13809.16s -> 13810.86s]  You can't explain like what you do,
[13810.86s -> 13813.37s]  just normally just kind of hanging out, right?
[13813.37s -> 13814.57s]  No, literally that's all I do.
[13814.57s -> 13817.95s]  Like I just, I watch, I watch anime,
[13817.95s -> 13819.43s]  I watch movies and that's it.
[13819.43s -> 13820.51s]  And I eat food.
[13820.51s -> 13821.35s]  People-
[13821.35s -> 13822.17s]  Sometimes I'll link up with some friends.
[13822.17s -> 13824.57s]  Like I'll go out to like a restaurant or something.
[13824.57s -> 13826.01s]  Yeah, people thought I was crazy because they were like,
[13826.01s -> 13827.85s]  oh, what do you do for the other time you're off stream?
[13827.85s -> 13831.42s]  Like you mentioned like the, oh, he's a killer, right?
[13831.42s -> 13833.90s]  Oh, that's something a killer would say.
[13833.90s -> 13835.84s]  I said the same exact shit.
[13835.84s -> 13836.88s]  I stopped the stream.
[13836.88s -> 13840.02s]  You're being a little too defensive there, okay?
[13840.02s -> 13842.42s]  That was like, sounds like what a killer would say.
[13842.42s -> 13844.62s]  But you can't explain what you do in a day.
[13844.62s -> 13845.94s]  You're just kind of like, okay, I do this
[13845.94s -> 13848.24s]  and then I hang out for a little bit.
[13848.24s -> 13849.44s]  Jerma, why does it sound like you're looking
[13849.44s -> 13853.02s]  for an alibi right now?
[13853.02s -> 13853.86s]  I don't need an alibi.
[13853.86s -> 13856.70s]  I'm playing multiverses with some buds.
[13856.70s -> 13858.50s]  No, not right now, I'm saying.
[13858.50s -> 13860.22s]  You mean like later?
[13862.23s -> 13863.71s]  Yeah, what would you say if like,
[13863.71s -> 13866.11s]  let's say like, you know, cops knock on your door, right?
[13866.11s -> 13867.91s]  I mean, I'm just in a hypothetical situation
[13867.91s -> 13872.01s]  and they're like, hey, where were you during, you know,
[13872.01s -> 13875.85s]  8 p.m. and 10 p.m. when this person was murdered?
[13875.85s -> 13877.94s]  Like, where were you?
[13877.94s -> 13879.66s]  Like, what would you say hypothetically to that?
[13879.66s -> 13881.14s]  That's what it sounds like.
[13881.14s -> 13883.14s]  Probably in the bathroom, if I'm honest.
[13885.14s -> 13887.04s]  Probably, actually probably in the bathroom.
[13887.04s -> 13890.79s]  I was in the bathroom.
[13890.79s -> 13892.05s]  Jerma legit kills people.
[13892.05s -> 13894.31s]  There were 984 previous Jermas.
[13894.31s -> 13895.15s]  He ended them all.
[13895.15s -> 13896.31s]  Is this true?
[13896.31s -> 13900.51s]  No, don't believe everything you read on the internet,
[13902.88s -> 13904.96s]  especially in a chat room on Twitch TV.
[13907.72s -> 13909.64s]  Wait, you mean to tell me that people lie on the internet?
[13909.64s -> 13910.64s]  What the fuck?
[13910.64s -> 13912.82s]  I lied to Charlie earlier.
[13912.82s -> 13913.66s]  What did you say?
[13913.66s -> 13915.22s]  What did you lie about?
[13915.22s -> 13916.26s]  I remember you caught me when I said
[13916.26s -> 13917.62s]  that I was playing as Jake.
[13917.62s -> 13920.06s]  Oh, that's true, that's true, yeah.
[13920.06s -> 13922.38s]  That was a bold face lie for no reason.
[13922.38s -> 13924.23s]  That was just bad manners.
[13924.23s -> 13926.35s]  See, deceit, deceit is in the blood.
[13926.35s -> 13929.19s]  Is Ludwig in an engineering room
[13929.19s -> 13931.23s]  crafting a controller right now?
[13931.23s -> 13934.35s]  Is he like soldering a chips?
[13934.35s -> 13935.51s]  Where is he?
[13935.51s -> 13937.71s]  Bro, this is what happens when you can't do react content
[13937.71s -> 13939.79s]  because you're streaming on YouTube, L.
[13939.79s -> 13941.83s]  He sent Cutie to GameStop to pick up
[13941.83s -> 13943.37s]  an old Xbox controller.
[13946.17s -> 13947.01s]  He's playing?
[13947.01s -> 13949.07s]  How does he not have a single fucking wired controller?
[13949.07s -> 13951.30s]  Hold on, he's playing another game?
[13951.30s -> 13952.14s]  What?
[13952.14s -> 13952.98s]  He's not?
[13952.98s -> 13953.80s]  What?
[13953.80s -> 13955.02s]  No, he's not, dude.
[13955.02s -> 13957.10s]  No shot.
[13957.10s -> 13958.53s]  Hello, hello.
[13958.53s -> 13959.61s]  Are you playing a different game?
[13959.61s -> 13961.13s]  Are you fucking joking?
[13961.13s -> 13963.05s]  Were you training?
[13963.05s -> 13965.13s]  No, I haven't.
[13965.13s -> 13967.98s]  Okay, you guys are misrepresenting me.
[13967.98s -> 13968.82s]  I haven't had a-
[13968.82s -> 13972.22s]  Hey, no way are you fucking training right now.
[13972.22s -> 13975.22s]  I was trying to figure out the controllers.
[13975.22s -> 13978.06s]  Bro, you are literally the sweatiest motherfucker
[13978.06s -> 13979.98s]  I've ever seen in my life, dude.
[13979.98s -> 13981.06s]  Are you okay?
[13981.06s -> 13982.54s]  I played one game with controller today.
[13983.22s -> 13984.66s]  I don't even know what buttons I'm supposed to press.
[13984.66s -> 13985.50s]  Are you fucking-
[13985.50s -> 13986.34s]  Did you get one working?
[13986.34s -> 13989.74s]  Dude, I don't know how to play video games at all.
[13989.74s -> 13990.94s]  You've beaten Elden Ring.
[13990.94s -> 13993.28s]  Stop misrepresenting yourself.
[13993.28s -> 13995.72s]  Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you, bro?
[13995.72s -> 13998.04s]  Stop playing more games
[13998.04s -> 13999.56s]  and get in the fucking lobby, Lon.
[13999.56s -> 14001.36s]  We're waiting for you.
[14001.36s -> 14002.20s]  I'm ready, I'm ready.
[14002.20s -> 14003.04s]  True.
[14003.04s -> 14006.53s]  Hold on, let me finish beating this kid
[14006.53s -> 14007.37s]  and then I'll be there.
[14007.37s -> 14008.69s]  I want to see it.
[14008.69s -> 14010.93s]  The music in the background makes this conversation
[14010.93s -> 14013.76s]  way funnier, by the way.
[14013.80s -> 14015.48s]  Oh my God, is this like,
[14015.48s -> 14017.48s]  are you giving me a gift today or something?
[14017.48s -> 14020.92s]  Because you feel bad that you betray me all the time?
[14020.92s -> 14022.24s]  Like when you gave the shirt,
[14022.24s -> 14024.84s]  our friendship shirt to Crazy Slick?
[14024.84s -> 14029.06s]  No.
[14029.06s -> 14029.90s]  What?
[14029.90s -> 14032.26s]  So you're just delivering L's to me
[14032.26s -> 14034.18s]  to make me look like a better gamer or something?
[14034.18s -> 14035.02s]  Is that why?
[14035.02s -> 14039.26s]  I think you are doing really good today, sweetheart.
[14039.26s -> 14043.42s]  I'm just gonna start inviting Lyric to this party.
[14043.42s -> 14046.22s]  Yeah, I bet Lyric wouldn't be fucking,
[14046.26s -> 14047.26s]  I bet Lyric wouldn't be like,
[14047.26s -> 14049.94s]  dicking around playing in like other lobbies,
[14049.94s -> 14051.14s]  waiting for us to cool down.
[14051.14s -> 14051.98s]  You know what I mean?
[14051.98s -> 14054.38s]  I would say, when you cool down like there's a meter,
[14054.38s -> 14055.70s]  you have a certain meter of ability.
[14055.70s -> 14057.26s]  Yeah, there's a moist meter, bitch.
[14057.26s -> 14059.22s]  Okay, hold on.
[14059.22s -> 14061.54s]  You still have not accepted my friend request,
[14061.54s -> 14062.38s]  which is fine.
[14062.38s -> 14067.42s]  I'll just keep doing custom game invites.
[14067.42s -> 14069.54s]  I'm kicking my legs under my chair right now.
[14069.54s -> 14072.07s]  I think Shaggy's good.
[14072.07s -> 14073.59s]  Shaggy is really good.
[14073.59s -> 14075.03s]  Shaggy is nuts.
[14075.03s -> 14075.87s]  Yeah.
[14075.87s -> 14076.69s]  If you know how to play.
[14076.69s -> 14080.18s]  I'll use Shaggy if you're a real one.
[14080.18s -> 14082.14s]  All right, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[14086.53s -> 14089.22s]  The music's so spiritual.
[14089.22s -> 14091.31s]  It's really good.
[14091.31s -> 14093.87s]  It's like John Williams in the booth.
[14093.87s -> 14097.99s]  All right, who is your most sought after potential,
[14097.99s -> 14099.95s]  like we're talking the whole Warner Brothers universe.
[14099.95s -> 14103.96s]  Who would you like to see in the game?
[14103.96s -> 14107.28s]  Remember, Warner Brothers owns a lot of property.
[14107.28s -> 14108.12s]  Yeah, I think.
[14108.12s -> 14109.64s]  I'd literally have to go Google.
[14109.64s -> 14111.04s]  I think they have Cartoon Network,
[14111.04s -> 14113.44s]  so Courage the Cowardly Dog for me.
[14113.44s -> 14114.44s]  That would be awesome.
[14114.44s -> 14115.28s]  That'd be so hype.
[14115.28s -> 14117.04s]  You own all of Cartoon Network?
[14117.04s -> 14118.20s]  I think so.
[14118.84s -> 14121.00s]  Do they own Hanna-Barbera, too, like all of it?
[14121.00s -> 14122.40s]  I'm pretty sure.
[14122.40s -> 14123.32s]  Do they own Toonami?
[14123.32s -> 14124.32s]  They do.
[14124.32s -> 14125.76s]  I want Cowboy Bebop.
[14125.76s -> 14128.00s]  I want Spike Siegel.
[14128.00s -> 14130.32s]  Oh, LeBron James would be kind of nuts.
[14130.32s -> 14132.55s]  Yo.
[14132.55s -> 14133.39s]  I just want Daffy Duck.
[14133.39s -> 14135.94s]  Send me another invite.
[14135.94s -> 14136.78s]  Be honest.
[14138.07s -> 14139.35s]  Did you say, give me an invite?
[14139.35s -> 14140.47s]  Yeah, send me another invite.
[14140.47s -> 14142.31s]  Daffy Duck and Fred Flintstone.
[14142.31s -> 14144.32s]  Here you go.
[14144.32s -> 14149.59s]  They own TBS.
[14149.59s -> 14153.43s]  Okay, I'm in.
[14153.43s -> 14154.99s]  The Road Runner?
[14154.99s -> 14159.16s]  Oh, that would be awesome.
[14159.16s -> 14167.00s]  The Road Runner would seriously be awesome.
[14167.00s -> 14170.84s]  Dude, I miss desktop streaming so much
[14170.84s -> 14172.28s]  when I was doing the IRLs and stuff
[14172.28s -> 14173.88s]  and doing desktop streams from the hotel.
[14173.88s -> 14175.84s]  It does not hit the same
[14175.84s -> 14182.56s]  when you're just sitting in your house and doing it.
[14182.56s -> 14184.36s]  Okay, this was feedback.
[14184.36s -> 14188.08s]  I was looking for feedback from a lobby full of streamers.
[14188.08s -> 14188.92s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14188.92s -> 14191.16s]  I want to be like, oh, I don't know.
[14191.16s -> 14192.00s]  It's crazy.
[14192.00s -> 14194.16s]  I don't feel that way at all.
[14194.16s -> 14195.84s]  That is just kind of nuts, actually.
[14195.84s -> 14197.72s]  Dude, I was in my own world.
[14198.60s -> 14199.44s]  I was literally in my own world.
[14199.44s -> 14200.28s]  I wasn't, I'm sorry.
[14200.28s -> 14201.12s]  No, it's cool, guys.
[14201.12s -> 14202.88s]  I'll just fuck myself.
[14202.88s -> 14206.72s]  I was just reading everyone in chat's most wanted characters
[14206.72s -> 14208.36s]  and I was going, that looks good, that looks good,
[14208.36s -> 14209.20s]  that looks good.
[14209.20s -> 14210.44s]  I just thought of a genius one
[14210.44s -> 14214.92s]  and it's because TBS is owned by the Warner Brothers
[14214.92s -> 14217.60s]  and they streamed Ely Counter-Strike.
[14217.60s -> 14222.23s]  So I want Tarek from C9 Counter-Strike.
[14222.23s -> 14223.91s]  Just with a sniper rifle.
[14225.72s -> 14227.76s]  Thank you, Reany, baby.
[14227.84s -> 14229.08s]  Dude, the mask?
[14229.08s -> 14231.97s]  No way.
[14231.97s -> 14235.13s]  Well, I did not pick Shaggy, so you shouldn't either.
[14235.13s -> 14236.25s]  Is the mask Warner Brothers?
[14236.25s -> 14237.61s]  Wait, I snap-picked him.
[14239.72s -> 14243.96s]  I also have a, oh God, I don't like perks,
[14243.96s -> 14245.92s]  but I guess you get them pretty early, so it's fine.
[14245.92s -> 14246.96s]  Perks are pretty helpful, yeah.
[14246.96s -> 14247.80s]  Just auto-equip them.
[14247.80s -> 14249.16s]  You don't need them.
[14249.16s -> 14250.44s]  Dude, the mask would be insane.
[14250.44s -> 14252.84s]  I don't have any promote characters.
[14252.84s -> 14253.68s]  At level 10 for Shaggy, you'd get a great one.
[14253.68s -> 14254.52s]  I want that there's a leak
[14254.52s -> 14257.11s]  that LeBron is going to be a DLC.
[14257.11s -> 14258.71s]  That'd be great. Prepare yourself.
[14258.71s -> 14259.55s]  I can see that.
[14260.95s -> 14262.67s]  That makes sense.
[14262.67s -> 14263.87s]  I wouldn't play any other character
[14263.87s -> 14264.99s]  if the mask was in the game.
[14264.99s -> 14269.68s]  I would have like a thousand hours on him.
[14269.68s -> 14270.80s]  Steve Urkel?
[14270.80s -> 14274.71s]  Steve Urkel is not, is Steve Urkel Warner Brothers?
[14274.71s -> 14275.55s]  Maybe.
[14275.55s -> 14279.55s]  They have their hand in a lot of pies, I think it could be.
[14279.55s -> 14280.99s]  Oh, Jesus.
[14280.99s -> 14282.27s]  I think it's a 1v1.
[14282.27s -> 14283.11s]  Oh, is it a 1v1?
[14283.11s -> 14285.67s]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[14285.67s -> 14286.51s]  What the fuck?
[14286.51s -> 14287.83s]  Jesus, leave me alone.
[14287.83s -> 14288.79s]  Is it a 1v1 or not?
[14288.79s -> 14289.63s]  Is this a 1v1?
[14289.63s -> 14290.59s]  Have we confirmed?
[14290.59s -> 14291.63s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[14291.63s -> 14292.47s]  It closes in.
[14292.47s -> 14293.55s]  Oh, are we doing a 1v1?
[14294.19s -> 14295.03s]  No, no, this stage sucks for that.
[14295.03s -> 14296.19s]  All right, all right.
[14296.19s -> 14298.31s]  You know how it closes in and stuff?
[14298.31s -> 14300.63s]  That's every stage though, when you do a free roll.
[14300.63s -> 14301.91s]  This one specifically goes to the edges
[14301.91s -> 14303.63s]  in the middle island.
[14305.20s -> 14306.60s]  Oh shit, no!
[14306.60s -> 14307.92s]  George Costanza?
[14307.92s -> 14309.32s]  I don't think that's Warner Brothers.
[14309.32s -> 14310.64s]  Don't do that, don't do that.
[14310.64s -> 14312.68s]  Come on, Mois, why are you edge guarding?
[14313.68s -> 14315.32s]  Oh, that was the right term.
[14315.32s -> 14316.80s]  Well, you're kind of a gamer.
[14316.80s -> 14317.92s]  Dude, dude, I know.
[14317.92s -> 14319.44s]  You said I'm a gamer twice today
[14319.44s -> 14321.24s]  and it's made me feel so good.
[14321.24s -> 14323.00s]  You're using the right terminology.
[14326.81s -> 14328.89s]  Oh, what the fuck is that?
[14328.89s -> 14341.16s]  It's called Velma.
[14341.16s -> 14342.00s]  I want that health.
[14342.00s -> 14344.06s]  Yabba dabba doo.
[14344.06s -> 14353.95s]  Yabba dabba doo.
[14353.95s -> 14355.71s]  Oh no!
[14355.71s -> 14357.15s]  Okay, now I'm playing like shit.
[14357.15s -> 14357.99s]  It's not good.
[14363.62s -> 14364.46s]  Gotcha.
[14364.46s -> 14365.94s]  Oh my goodness, all those bounces
[14365.94s -> 14367.94s]  were exactly what I needed.
[14367.94s -> 14376.70s]  Oh my gosh, what a dumpster.
[14376.70s -> 14387.21s]  What the fuck, Velma?
[14387.21s -> 14390.82s]  There I go.
[14390.82s -> 14391.66s]  What the fuck?
[14391.66s -> 14393.86s]  How are you doing that?
[14393.86s -> 14397.64s]  I'm coming for you.
[14397.64s -> 14399.76s]  Oh my God.
[14399.76s -> 14401.24s]  Oh my God.
[14401.24s -> 14403.16s]  I'm getting fucking destroyed right now.
[14403.16s -> 14405.76s]  Everyone is, why is everybody farming me?
[14405.76s -> 14406.60s]  Everybody calm down.
[14406.60s -> 14408.58s]  Don't hit me anymore, please.
[14408.58s -> 14409.86s]  Oh, no jumps.
[14424.58s -> 14426.42s]  Oh boy.
[14426.42s -> 14427.26s]  That's not good.
[14427.26s -> 14428.70s]  Oh my God, what just happened?
[14429.70s -> 14430.54s]  God.
[14430.54s -> 14433.22s]  All right, I still held it even with that chaos.
[14433.22s -> 14434.86s]  I think I clutched up in the last second,
[14434.86s -> 14435.82s]  but then I died.
[14435.82s -> 14436.70s]  I got annihilated.
[14436.70s -> 14437.54s]  I don't know.
[14437.54s -> 14440.68s]  I actually don't know what happened.
[14440.68s -> 14443.16s]  Is there a stock game mode?
[14443.84s -> 14445.76s]  That'd be swag.
[14445.76s -> 14448.08s]  Hey man, I'm really glad you fixed your controller,
[14448.08s -> 14448.92s]  by the way.
[14448.92s -> 14449.76s]  That was really good.
[14449.76s -> 14450.60s]  It was a good performance.
[14450.60s -> 14451.44s]  I mean, 12 points.
[14451.44s -> 14452.28s]  So here you go.
[14452.28s -> 14455.32s]  I'm gonna, you know what, I'm gonna toast you.
[14455.32s -> 14460.41s]  That just means you are better at kill stealing,
[14460.41s -> 14461.25s]  which is fine.
[14462.21s -> 14463.89s]  You sure you want to leave the lobby?
[14463.89s -> 14467.12s]  No, I am not sure.
[14467.12s -> 14469.68s]  Tony Soprano is Warner Brothers?
[14469.68s -> 14473.97s]  Yo.
[14473.97s -> 14475.65s]  I don't know how accurate all these are, by the way.
[14475.65s -> 14480.01s]  I'm just saying what people are saying in chat.
[14480.05s -> 14481.37s]  Warner Bros. characters.
[14485.66s -> 14486.50s]  Let's change it up.
[14486.50s -> 14487.78s]  I'll try something different.
[14487.78s -> 14489.82s]  Yeah, I'm gonna do a different character here as well.
[14489.82s -> 14491.10s]  Yeah, definitely don't do Shaggy.
[14491.10s -> 14494.60s]  Wait, Harry Potter is Warner Bros.
[14494.60s -> 14495.44s]  Imagine?
[14495.44s -> 14497.44s]  In Neo from the Matrix.
[14497.44s -> 14499.76s]  Do you guys want to change the game?
[14499.76s -> 14502.56s]  Oh, fuck, I started already, but wait, hold on.
[14502.56s -> 14503.40s]  Back to the lobby.
[14503.40s -> 14505.12s]  What do you mean by this?
[14505.12s -> 14507.32s]  Yeah, you can put stocks on.
[14507.32s -> 14508.32s]  Here, I put Moist.
[14508.32s -> 14509.64s]  You're the party leader.
[14509.64s -> 14510.92s]  Go ahead, do your thing.
[14511.76s -> 14514.24s]  All right.
[14514.80s -> 14516.94s]  I don't know where to do that.
[14516.94s -> 14520.19s]  Oh, you get like little missions, this is cool.
[14520.19s -> 14523.12s]  Can you put stocks on?
[14523.12s -> 14527.19s]  Highest score win.
[14527.19s -> 14528.39s]  How's Aria?
[14528.39s -> 14529.85s]  Is Aria good?
[14529.85s -> 14532.15s]  Yeah.
[14532.15s -> 14536.21s]  Well, she was in the tech test.
[14536.21s -> 14539.08s]  Teen Titans, yeah, be tight.
[14539.08s -> 14542.20s]  John Oliver is technically HBO and WB, so.
[14543.56s -> 14544.64s]  I don't want to do that.
[14544.64s -> 14545.80s]  I don't want to say that.
[14545.80s -> 14549.44s]  And I don't want to have a turtle wearing a hat.
[14549.44s -> 14550.40s]  That's pretty good.
[14550.40s -> 14551.24s]  Thank you.
[14551.24s -> 14552.08s]  It's way better than your Batman.
[14552.08s -> 14556.78s]  Thank you.
[14557.78s -> 14563.83s]  I don't know if this worked, but we're going to try it.
[14563.83s -> 14564.67s]  It's fine.
[14564.67s -> 14566.52s]  Okay, let's ride.
[14566.52s -> 14568.16s]  Wondervere is going to hit me up and be like,
[14568.16s -> 14570.08s]  hey, why was 30 minutes of your two hour stream
[14570.08s -> 14570.92s]  technical support?
[14570.92s -> 14572.28s]  Choose your character.
[14572.28s -> 14574.05s]  Uh-huh.
[14574.05s -> 14574.89s]  So are we-
[14574.89s -> 14576.21s]  Do we get like obscenities at the screen?
[14576.21s -> 14577.89s]  Are we doing, are we doing-
[14577.89s -> 14579.65s]  No, they're going to be like, hey,
[14579.65s -> 14581.25s]  we're no longer going to partner with you
[14581.25s -> 14583.05s]  because you got fucking your shit pushed in
[14583.05s -> 14584.89s]  by a political streamer.
[14584.89s -> 14586.29s]  1v1 right now, 1v1 right now.
[14586.29s -> 14587.77s]  Stocks on, real gamers.
[14589.05s -> 14590.89s]  What is stocks?
[14590.93s -> 14594.53s]  Instead of like getting random amounts of points
[14594.53s -> 14597.17s]  based off kills, you have a certain amount of lives.
[14597.17s -> 14598.01s]  Yeah.
[14598.01s -> 14601.85s]  And when the lives are depleted, it's over.
[14601.85s -> 14604.41s]  Oh, there's a list of incoming characters.
[14604.41s -> 14605.81s]  I mean, I don't know how that's done, but sure.
[14605.81s -> 14607.58s]  I'll play it.
[14607.58s -> 14610.10s]  Let's just play it as first and then we'll do it after.
[14610.10s -> 14613.32s]  No, I think this is stocks if you guys want to 1v1.
[14613.32s -> 14615.60s]  Seems like he's a little scared about doing it this round.
[14615.60s -> 14617.71s]  I mean, I'll try it.
[14617.71s -> 14620.27s]  But wait, you do understand that it's a win-win for me
[14620.27s -> 14621.11s]  regardless, right?
[14621.11s -> 14621.95s]  Because like, I'm not a gamer.
[14621.99s -> 14622.83s]  No, I've never played this game.
[14622.83s -> 14623.67s]  They're totally separate.
[14623.67s -> 14624.51s]  I'm not a gamer either.
[14624.51s -> 14625.33s]  I literally stream.
[14625.33s -> 14626.17s]  It literally doesn't matter.
[14626.17s -> 14627.79s]  You played more games on stream than I have in the past year.
[14627.79s -> 14629.95s]  Even if you win, even if you win,
[14629.95s -> 14633.19s]  you owned a 31 year old dude
[14633.19s -> 14636.03s]  whose community blames him for never playing video games.
[14636.03s -> 14636.87s]  Prepare yourself.
[14636.87s -> 14640.03s]  You are hedging every single alternative of you losing
[14640.03s -> 14641.67s]  with a different excuse.
[14641.67s -> 14642.51s]  I mean.
[14642.51s -> 14644.43s]  Sack up and play your best in winner-loose.
[14644.43s -> 14645.27s]  I'm doing that.
[14645.27s -> 14646.11s]  I'm doing that.
[14646.11s -> 14647.19s]  But also, I'm doing that,
[14647.19s -> 14649.27s]  but also I need you to remember
[14649.27s -> 14651.67s]  that like everything I said is true.
[14652.35s -> 14654.39s]  You bailed on your friends going to Korea.
[14654.39s -> 14655.29s]  What?
[14655.29s -> 14657.43s]  I said you bailed on your friends going to Korea.
[14657.43s -> 14658.35s]  Okay.
[14658.35s -> 14661.30s]  Also, that's not true.
[14670.32s -> 14671.48s]  How do you turn off items?
[14671.48s -> 14673.72s]  I turned off hazards, but items are still on.
[14674.76s -> 14675.60s]  Oh God.
[14687.50s -> 14689.72s]  Oh, you just got the credit for that.
[14691.98s -> 14692.82s]  I don't know.
[14692.82s -> 14693.66s]  I can't tell.
[14693.66s -> 14695.46s]  So I'm just throwing myself down to see.
[14702.06s -> 14703.70s]  Thank you for that Moist.
[14703.70s -> 14704.54s]  Yeah, no problem.
[14704.54s -> 14705.70s]  It's definitely not stocks.
[14705.70s -> 14707.34s]  We can just keep track of stocks.
[14707.34s -> 14709.34s]  We can do like a two stock game here.
[14722.57s -> 14724.57s]  Dude, what is happening?
[14724.57s -> 14725.93s]  Can anybody hear me?
[14725.93s -> 14726.85s]  Yeah, yeah.
[14726.85s -> 14727.81s]  Dude, what's going on?
[14727.81s -> 14729.13s]  I got stuck in the void.
[14729.13s -> 14731.61s]  I literally, my face cam is frozen.
[14731.61s -> 14732.45s]  My computer crashed.
[14732.45s -> 14737.08s]  How did that happen?
[14737.08s -> 14739.24s]  Wait, are you just taking free kills now?
[14739.24s -> 14741.08s]  Cause you noticed Jerma's AFK?
[14741.08s -> 14741.92s]  They're irrelevant.
[14741.92s -> 14742.76s]  No.
[14742.76s -> 14743.60s]  What do you mean they're irrelevant?
[14743.60s -> 14744.44s]  I'm here.
[14744.44s -> 14746.00s]  You said we count stocks.
[14746.00s -> 14748.92s]  Wait, so the rules of the game changed all of a sudden?
[14748.92s -> 14749.76s]  Like, I don't understand.
[14749.76s -> 14750.60s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14750.60s -> 14751.72s]  We're just counting stocks.
[14753.36s -> 14754.84s]  Hello?
[14754.84s -> 14755.68s]  Hey.
[14759.52s -> 14762.20s]  Dude, my webcam is fucked.
[14762.20s -> 14765.43s]  What's going on over there, Jeremy?
[14765.43s -> 14766.27s]  I don't understand.
[14766.27s -> 14767.09s]  So what are we doing right now?
[14768.09s -> 14769.93s]  So right now you're winning.
[14769.93s -> 14772.17s]  So Ludwig's down a stock, you're up a stock.
[14772.17s -> 14774.73s]  Wait, I just watched first set.
[14774.73s -> 14777.01s]  Yeah, but you haven't killed Dasan yet, have you?
[14777.01s -> 14777.85s]  Yeah.
[14777.85s -> 14778.69s]  Oh, you have?
[14778.69s -> 14779.53s]  Oh, that's tight.
[14779.53s -> 14782.90s]  You have?
[14782.90s -> 14786.57s]  Yeah, do it again, do it again.
[14786.57s -> 14788.61s]  Oh, you're so shameless.
[14788.61s -> 14789.65s]  That was good.
[14789.65s -> 14791.17s]  That was good.
[14791.17s -> 14792.01s]  But so was this.
[14792.01s -> 14793.65s]  What the fuck?
[14806.08s -> 14806.92s]  What?
[14806.92s -> 14808.32s]  How?
[14808.32s -> 14809.44s]  No, don't take that.
[14810.40s -> 14811.24s]  What the fuck?
[14811.24s -> 14812.08s]  Honest man.
[14812.08s -> 14813.92s]  Oh, you scumbag.
[14817.55s -> 14818.39s]  Oh my God.
[14848.35s -> 14849.39s]  Here we go.
[14851.50s -> 14852.66s]  Oh God, what the fuck?
[14852.66s -> 14855.10s]  Sorry guys, I had some technical problems.
[14855.10s -> 14855.94s]  My whole computer crashed.
[14855.94s -> 14858.30s]  No, no, no, it's one v one anyway.
[14858.30s -> 14859.94s]  Yeah, yeah, it's just a one v one.
[14868.98s -> 14871.26s]  I'm gonna try to clear all the items myself.
[14876.77s -> 14877.61s]  Shit.
[14878.57s -> 14879.41s]  Oh, fuck.
[14885.31s -> 14886.63s]  The box is breaking.
[14886.63s -> 14888.47s]  Oh shit, no.
[14888.47s -> 14889.51s]  Wait, is that two?
[14889.51s -> 14890.35s]  What are we doing?
[14890.35s -> 14891.19s]  That's two.
[14891.19s -> 14892.03s]  We got one stock left.
[14892.03s -> 14895.99s]  We're doing a three stock game.
[14895.99s -> 14897.47s]  No, Jesus.
[14908.01s -> 14908.85s]  Oh my God.
[14908.85s -> 14910.60s]  That's game.
[14910.60s -> 14911.44s]  That's game.
[14911.44s -> 14912.80s]  Yeah, that's great, great game.
[14912.80s -> 14914.12s]  It's all good.
[14914.12s -> 14915.76s]  Let's play some Tootie Toos.
[14915.76s -> 14917.20s]  Tootie Toos?
[14917.20s -> 14918.60s]  That's another ring out.
[14918.60s -> 14920.40s]  Do you want more or are you done?
[14921.70s -> 14925.09s]  Oh, I'm jumping to my death every time.
[14925.09s -> 14926.29s]  I like this end of the game here
[14926.29s -> 14930.13s]  where you get the Fortnite dome.
[14930.13s -> 14931.61s]  Yeah, it's pretty cool actually.
[14931.61s -> 14932.61s]  I like that a lot.
[14932.61s -> 14933.81s]  There you go, you got one, Lud.
[14933.81s -> 14935.29s]  Good job.
[14935.29s -> 14937.74s]  Let's try again.
[14937.74s -> 14939.90s]  And you had the cheesiest character is fine.
[14939.90s -> 14941.74s]  I mean, it's not a big deal, but like.
[14949.49s -> 14950.85s]  I'm jumping to my death.
[14952.29s -> 14953.61s]  Nice shot.
[14953.61s -> 14957.64s]  I won't let that happen again.
[14957.64s -> 14959.76s]  Is this game similar to Smash Bros, by the way?
[14959.76s -> 14961.60s]  It's like, I've literally never played it.
[14961.60s -> 14963.60s]  Almost a one-on-one clone.
[14963.60s -> 14964.72s]  Okay.
[14964.72s -> 14967.04s]  Should I start, should I play Smash Bros?
[14967.04s -> 14968.28s]  You should, you'd like it.
[14968.28s -> 14970.80s]  Hold on, hold on now.
[14970.80s -> 14973.80s]  Before anybody says anything too drastic here.
[14973.80s -> 14976.68s]  Smash Ultimate, I'm gonna say this right now.
[14976.68s -> 14977.92s]  I have to, I want opinions
[14977.92s -> 14979.80s]  from the people that played a lot of Smash.
[14979.80s -> 14984.94s]  Smash Ultimate has way too much shit on the screen.
[14984.94s -> 14985.86s]  What?
[14985.86s -> 14987.06s]  When you attack somebody,
[14987.06s -> 14991.54s]  it does these like giant particle effect lightning smoke
[14991.54s -> 14992.86s]  on every single move.
[14992.86s -> 14995.98s]  Boys, are you gonna add me to your e-sports team?
[14995.98s -> 14998.90s]  Yeah, I'll recruit you for the Moist e-sports
[14998.90s -> 15001.18s]  multi-versus squad once we pop off.
[15001.18s -> 15002.22s]  Let's fucking go, dude.
[15002.22s -> 15003.46s]  After I destroyed Ludwig,
[15003.46s -> 15006.62s]  who I thought was like a professional at this.
[15006.62s -> 15008.58s]  You were looking pretty clean there for a minute.
[15008.58s -> 15009.54s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[15009.54s -> 15011.76s]  One of the best players, man.
[15011.76s -> 15014.14s]  I'm just saying, I'm just saying.
[15014.14s -> 15016.10s]  I disagree, Jerma.
[15016.10s -> 15017.98s]  I think it's the right, unless you play with items.
[15017.98s -> 15020.26s]  Are you talking about like with items?
[15020.26s -> 15022.94s]  No, I'm just, okay, so you're gonna notice this now
[15022.94s -> 15023.78s]  and you're gonna be like,
[15023.78s -> 15025.58s]  why the fuck did he have to say that?
[15025.58s -> 15027.74s]  When you do like a regular attack
[15027.74s -> 15029.50s]  or a special attack, doesn't matter.
[15029.50s -> 15032.74s]  It creates this gigantic explosion,
[15032.74s -> 15036.22s]  a huge smoke light show explosion
[15036.22s -> 15037.70s]  anytime you touch anybody.
[15037.70s -> 15038.74s]  Anytime you move around,
[15038.74s -> 15040.66s]  there's just like smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
[15040.66s -> 15043.70s]  It's a ton of particle effects and it messes my head.
[15043.70s -> 15044.54s]  I don't think I've noticed.
[15044.54s -> 15045.46s]  I know there's sparks.
[15045.46s -> 15048.02s]  So like sparks come out when you deliver an attack
[15048.02s -> 15049.58s]  that'll probably kill.
[15049.58s -> 15050.82s]  It's like a really strong attack
[15050.82s -> 15053.26s]  and a high percent of little sparks will come out.
[15053.26s -> 15054.34s]  And run.
[15054.34s -> 15057.70s]  Yeah, like in wave, not wave dashing, dash dancing.
[15057.70s -> 15059.58s]  You get like a little smoke that pops up.
[15059.58s -> 15061.70s]  Hey, I'm not saying that Ultimate's a bad game.
[15061.70s -> 15062.90s]  I think it's a great game.
[15062.90s -> 15063.74s]  I just-
[15063.74s -> 15064.58s]  But if I were to pick my favorite game
[15064.58s -> 15068.07s]  in the world, it'd be multiverses.
[15068.07s -> 15070.09s]  Is your ad still going?
[15070.09s -> 15071.58s]  No.
[15071.58s -> 15074.32s]  Oh. Yeah, I got five minutes.
[15074.32s -> 15075.48s]  Hey, I didn't say anything.
[15075.48s -> 15078.04s]  All I said is that I'm an old person
[15078.04s -> 15079.96s]  and the less stuff on the screen
[15079.96s -> 15082.74s]  that I have to look at, the better.
[15082.74s -> 15085.50s]  Is this a me gap here?
[15085.50s -> 15087.02s]  Oh, waiting for lobby leader.
[15087.02s -> 15087.94s]  Oh, wait.
[15087.94s -> 15089.34s]  No, you're not even in the lobby.
[15089.34s -> 15090.22s]  It's just me.
[15090.22s -> 15092.38s]  For some reason, it's just me and Jerma
[15092.38s -> 15094.30s]  in the lobby right now.
[15094.30s -> 15095.90s]  Yeah, I see it too.
[15095.90s -> 15096.74s]  We should restart it.
[15096.74s -> 15097.58s]  We should restart it.
[15097.58s -> 15098.46s]  We should restart it.
[15098.46s -> 15099.86s]  Hold on.
[15099.86s -> 15101.46s]  I'll do another custom game.
[15101.46s -> 15103.02s]  I'll do another custom game lobby
[15103.02s -> 15104.10s]  and then I'll give it to you.
[15104.10s -> 15105.38s]  I'll hand it off to you.
[15105.38s -> 15106.82s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[15106.82s -> 15108.89s]  Yeah, do that.
[15108.89s -> 15112.92s]  Okay, invited the big moist.
[15113.08s -> 15114.88s]  We still has not accepted my friend requests.
[15114.88s -> 15115.84s]  I'm not cool.
[15115.84s -> 15116.52s]  Aren't I here?
[15116.52s -> 15117.52s]  Oh, there we go.
[15117.52s -> 15119.32s]  I'm air coots 31.
[15119.32s -> 15120.28s]  I know.
[15120.28s -> 15121.72s]  We're friends.
[15121.72s -> 15124.06s]  We're not in the game.
[15124.06s -> 15125.26s]  No, not in real.
[15125.26s -> 15126.54s]  Why did you specify like that?
[15126.54s -> 15127.94s]  Are we now friends in real life?
[15127.94s -> 15128.78s]  No, not anymore.
[15128.78s -> 15130.02s]  But yeah, okay.
[15130.02s -> 15130.98s]  No, it's cool.
[15130.98s -> 15131.98s]  Oh, I've sent you a friend request.
[15131.98s -> 15133.14s]  You have not accepted it.
[15133.14s -> 15133.78s]  That's not true.
[15133.78s -> 15134.74s]  I sent you one.
[15134.74s -> 15135.66s]  You guys call these teams.
[15135.66s -> 15137.02s]  We go with this.
[15137.02s -> 15138.02s]  I'm ready to ride.
[15138.02s -> 15138.86s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[15138.86s -> 15140.77s]  I see it now.
[15140.77s -> 15143.14s]  I'm going to bust out the bugs.
[15143.18s -> 15143.86s]  You want bugs?
[15143.86s -> 15144.18s]  All right.
[15144.18s -> 15146.38s]  Yeah, let's see it.
[15146.38s -> 15147.58s]  I feel like you got a good box.
[15147.58s -> 15148.94s]  Fuck, I forgot to hand it off to you.
[15148.94s -> 15150.74s]  And I just press play.
[15150.74s -> 15151.10s]  God damn.
[15151.10s -> 15153.70s]  Oh, no, no, it's all it's all good.
[15153.70s -> 15154.82s]  Back to lobby, back to lobby here.
[15154.82s -> 15155.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[15155.78s -> 15156.46s]  The settings are right.
[15156.46s -> 15157.10s]  The settings are right.
[15157.10s -> 15157.58s]  You're good.
[15157.58s -> 15158.14s]  You're good.
[15158.14s -> 15164.02s]  Teams to be to four ring out seven minutes hazards enabled.
[15164.02s -> 15167.66s]  That's good for going to be to I got to play something I know.
[15167.66s -> 15169.90s]  You can play bugs.
[15169.90s -> 15171.46s]  It says you guys are refreshing.
[15171.46s -> 15175.74s]  I exited out and went back to the lobby and I can't start the game again.
[15175.74s -> 15176.38s]  We got to back out.
[15176.38s -> 15176.78s]  We got to back.
[15176.78s -> 15179.32s]  Yeah, no, back out.
[15179.32s -> 15180.36s]  Yeah.
[15180.36s -> 15182.32s]  And now we can boot it up again.
[15182.32s -> 15184.48s]  No, moist is still not backed out.
[15184.48s -> 15186.52s]  But how do how do you back out in this?
[15186.52s -> 15188.44s]  Yeah, how do you back out here?
[15188.44s -> 15190.04s]  Just press the button.
[15190.04s -> 15191.52s]  No, it doesn't work for me.
[15191.52s -> 15193.86s]  Yeah, I think I think we're in here.
[15193.86s -> 15194.14s]  All right.
[15194.14s -> 15197.94s]  Leave Lobby around two.
[15197.94s -> 15200.98s]  OK, we actually might just get booted.
[15200.98s -> 15209.74s]  Probably have Lobby going to restart it.
[15209.74s -> 15213.68s]  Taz is very concerned about how long that was taking.
[15213.68s -> 15215.41s]  There we go.
[15215.41s -> 15230.06s]  OK, inviting, inviting.
[15230.06s -> 15232.06s]  I think I got I got a solid
[15232.06s -> 15233.46s]  another three or four games in me.
[15233.46s -> 15235.94s]  I'll play with German. I'll play with German.
[15235.94s -> 15237.72s]  Wait, what happened?
[15237.72s -> 15239.68s]  We're in. Do you want to do this?
[15239.68s -> 15241.12s]  We're good. Yeah.
[15241.12s -> 15244.56s]  OK, I'm sorry, German.
[15244.56s -> 15247.58s]  Hey, we we had a pretty good run.
[15247.58s -> 15252.93s]  Choose your character.
[15252.93s -> 15255.76s]  Oh, I love that.
[15255.76s -> 15257.52s]  Look at this guy.
[15257.52s -> 15260.76s]  You guys playing canonical friends?
[15260.76s -> 15262.60s]  We both have similar hair color.
[15262.60s -> 15263.80s]  Oh, that's big.
[15263.80s -> 15266.12s]  Yeah, and I am I just I mean,
[15266.12s -> 15270.14s]  the Tasmanian devil is not a dog, but close.
[15270.54s -> 15271.54s]  It's not that you can.
[15271.54s -> 15274.42s]  Oh, it makes sense, I guess, that you can't fucking upgrade.
[15274.54s -> 15276.14s]  Like you level up when you're playing 2v2
[15276.14s -> 15278.58s]  because your friends will let you cheese. Right. Yeah.
[15279.78s -> 15281.78s]  Prepare yourself.
[15281.78s -> 15284.30s]  I really I feel like this would be a crossover episode, though.
[15284.70s -> 15286.86s]  Like Taz would replace Scooby for some reason.
[15286.86s -> 15290.06s]  And it'd be like a really funny door one time and then pop out
[15290.06s -> 15292.34s]  and it'd be Scooby coming back in.
[15292.34s -> 15294.50s]  Oh, the hallway scenes. Yeah.
[15294.54s -> 15295.94s]  They eat a lot, doesn't Taz.
[15295.94s -> 15297.42s]  Taz eats a shitload of food.
[15297.42s -> 15299.98s]  He's perfect for a crossover of a hungry bear.
[15303.67s -> 15305.15s]  Oh, my God.
[15305.15s -> 15318.06s]  Too hard. What's different about this game mode?
[15319.25s -> 15322.05s]  Tasmanian devil is crazy crack. Holy shit.
[15322.37s -> 15327.37s]  Yeah. Taz is kind of scary.
[15327.37s -> 15329.57s]  Watch out. Oh, my. What was that?
[15329.57s -> 15348.60s]  That's the. That was my. Missing me.
[15348.60s -> 15351.55s]  Oh, shit. No.
[15351.55s -> 15353.71s]  Oh, shit. How is yours?
[15353.71s -> 15355.39s]  Wait, what the fuck?
[15355.39s -> 15357.78s]  What just happened?
[15357.78s -> 15360.19s]  Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying.
[15360.19s -> 15361.91s]  You're fine. Not good. We're good. We're good.
[15361.91s -> 15365.80s]  We're good. I'm playing bad.
[15365.80s -> 15366.84s]  It's nice. Nice.
[15366.84s -> 15368.96s]  That was bullshit. That was fucking bullshit.
[15372.56s -> 15374.64s]  Oh, that's that. That's a bunch of baloney.
[15375.28s -> 15377.56s]  It really is. It's absolute baloney. I agree.
[15378.44s -> 15382.44s]  OK. Doing that from off the stage is just oh, it's hard.
[15382.44s -> 15384.56s]  It's horrible to deal with.
[15397.33s -> 15401.97s]  Nice catch. Oh, good tosses on.
[15404.95s -> 15407.51s]  Whoop. Get fucked.
[15407.51s -> 15410.91s]  Get fucked. Oh, that was unbelievable.
[15411.59s -> 15413.75s]  You just destroyed me. That was unbelievable.
[15413.75s -> 15418.66s]  Perfect placement. Stay there.
[15418.66s -> 15420.26s]  Oh, shit. Oh, oh, I'm done.
[15420.26s -> 15422.10s]  Oh, that was in his mind.
[15422.10s -> 15425.78s]  Blue team. Oh, come on, dude.
[15427.38s -> 15441.02s]  Patience on the close game.
[15441.02s -> 15443.30s]  The music at the end is like Batman.
[15444.22s -> 15446.62s]  Oh, my God. I just got Molly walked.
[15446.62s -> 15448.98s]  Yeah, you did. Oh, you did.
[15448.98s -> 15451.34s]  What? Oh, it's all right.
[15451.34s -> 15452.86s]  Let's go. Let's go.
[15452.86s -> 15455.54s]  Good shit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, shit.
[15455.70s -> 15457.50s]  I thought my down B was about to go.
[15457.50s -> 15459.42s]  Hey, moist these boards, baby.
[15459.42s -> 15461.10s]  That's how we do it.
[15461.10s -> 15462.22s]  That was a clue.
[15462.22s -> 15463.46s]  We're close there, Jerma.
[15463.46s -> 15464.98s]  Yeah, that was a close shit.
[15464.98s -> 15467.22s]  Dude, you had all those KOs, man.
[15467.54s -> 15469.82s]  I got a few, but we didn't take down the goat.
[15471.02s -> 15473.26s]  Tricky. Are you talking about me?
[15474.06s -> 15476.10s]  Yeah, it was the damage.
[15476.10s -> 15477.66s]  But the KOs is the easy part.
[15477.66s -> 15480.82s]  People say that choose your character.
[15480.82s -> 15482.38s]  Bugs kind of nuts.
[15482.38s -> 15484.38s]  That bat is so good.
[15484.38s -> 15486.10s]  The bat has such an insane range.
[15486.10s -> 15489.38s]  What are you doing? You're in a bit of a bit of a bit of a fist thing.
[15489.78s -> 15491.66s]  Oh, yeah. That's pretty good.
[15491.66s -> 15493.46s]  That's hard to break through life.
[15493.46s -> 15496.06s]  Yeah. That shit will stun for a minute.
[15496.06s -> 15498.82s]  I am using too many specials.
[15498.82s -> 15501.78s]  I have no idea how to play like what is that?
[15501.78s -> 15503.34s]  What is the assassin character like?
[15503.34s -> 15504.34s]  How do they?
[15504.94s -> 15507.98s]  I assume they're good at KOs and have a lot of hit moves and are easy to kill.
[15508.26s -> 15510.06s]  It's like, are you?
[15510.46s -> 15513.50s]  Yeah, I don't know. I've just been playing bruiser characters or tanks.
[15514.83s -> 15518.19s]  Also, you know, I didn't know beforehand is when you use your dodge,
[15518.19s -> 15520.63s]  if you use it in succession, it gets worse, right?
[15522.22s -> 15524.82s]  Yeah, you have a little meter underneath your character.
[15525.46s -> 15527.70s]  Oh, I thought it was just when you land on the ground, it's reset.
[15528.38s -> 15531.82s]  Yeah, you deplete it and it gets shorter and shorter and shorter.
[15531.82s -> 15533.90s]  If you go all the way down, that makes sense.
[15536.56s -> 15538.64s]  Which makes it because there's no block, right?
[15538.64s -> 15541.16s]  There's no whole block. Right. Yeah.
[15543.98s -> 15546.50s]  Dude, I was supposed to when I got done with the hashtag ad,
[15546.50s -> 15549.50s]  I was supposed to go back to doing politics because I haven't covered it
[15549.86s -> 15553.32s]  in a while and I just got totally hooked on this.
[15554.12s -> 15556.64s]  Playing video games with friends is great.
[15557.24s -> 15558.08s]  Well, you're not doing that.
[15558.08s -> 15562.00s]  So playing video games with friends plus Ludwig is great.
[15563.04s -> 15565.83s]  I agree. It's good.
[15565.83s -> 15567.31s]  All right, let's go for it.
[15567.31s -> 15578.88s]  Come on for Steven Universe.
[15578.88s -> 15580.84s]  Oh, it's a knee.
[15587.94s -> 15589.82s]  Oh, I didn't even see that coming.
[15589.82s -> 15591.70s]  Great teamwork right there, moist.
[15591.70s -> 15593.78s]  Good work. I saw that.
[15593.78s -> 15597.54s]  Oh, shit. Oh, wow.
[15597.54s -> 15603.31s]  What's kind of going in?
[15603.31s -> 15607.07s]  Oh, well, OK.
[15607.27s -> 15608.27s]  Wait, what?
[15608.27s -> 15609.63s]  Wait, what just happened?
[15609.63s -> 15611.19s]  I had no job.
[15611.19s -> 15613.87s]  No, it literally broke like I jumped.
[15613.87s -> 15614.67s]  And then the game.
[15614.67s -> 15617.61s]  Wait, what is going on right now?
[15617.61s -> 15619.01s]  I did jump.
[15619.01s -> 15630.09s]  My safe didn't get off.
[15630.09s -> 15640.26s]  Yeah. Oh, no.
[15640.26s -> 15646.78s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[15646.78s -> 15650.20s]  Damn it.
[15650.20s -> 15654.66s]  That was big. That was big.
[15654.66s -> 15658.00s]  I don't know what. Oh, fuck.
[15658.00s -> 15660.68s]  OK, I need a hard carry here, Charlie.
[15660.68s -> 15662.91s]  All right. Hold on. I'm coming.
[15662.91s -> 15664.79s]  No, I'm just saying, because I suck.
[15664.79s -> 15666.61s]  No, you're fine.
[15666.61s -> 15669.96s]  I am in trouble here.
[15669.96s -> 15673.87s]  Oh, I thought I lived that.
[15673.87s -> 15675.71s]  How am I still alive?
[15675.71s -> 15676.63s]  How are you alive?
[15676.63s -> 15678.83s]  You're the goat. You're the goat.
[15678.99s -> 15680.19s]  No, that's it's over. Right.
[15680.19s -> 15682.47s]  What? Oh, I missed the bet.
[15685.81s -> 15689.89s]  Dude, not living through that one.
[15689.89s -> 15704.51s]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[15704.51s -> 15705.51s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[15705.51s -> 15712.26s]  It's not what I meant to do.
[15712.26s -> 15714.62s]  Oh, you're so slippery.
[15714.62s -> 15720.44s]  Red team.
[15720.44s -> 15721.60s]  Wait, what?
[15721.60s -> 15724.78s]  Missed?
[15724.78s -> 15725.74s]  No, I got it. Oh, my God.
[15725.74s -> 15727.83s]  You're so slippery.
[15727.83s -> 15736.05s]  Me? Mm hmm.
[15736.05s -> 15740.49s]  Oh, that safe came out of nowhere.
[15741.98s -> 15747.61s]  Look, Minecraft Steve.
[15747.61s -> 15750.01s]  Come on, baby. I'm trying to dial in.
[15750.81s -> 15754.66s]  Oh, oh, my God. We can win this.
[15754.66s -> 15756.06s]  Oh, no. Hang in there.
[15756.06s -> 15757.82s]  Oh, I died. I died.
[15757.82s -> 15762.51s]  It's fine. It's fine.
[15762.51s -> 15766.83s]  Dude, what the fuck? That's done.
[15766.83s -> 15773.28s]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[15774.77s -> 15777.57s]  No, you got so lucky, Ludd.
[15779.35s -> 15780.83s]  No, no, it's over.
[15780.83s -> 15782.62s]  We got this.
[15782.62s -> 15785.14s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[15785.66s -> 15789.66s]  Wait, no, it was one kick.
[15789.66s -> 15792.02s]  I got it. I got him in the sandwich.
[15792.02s -> 15792.86s]  I got him in the sandwich.
[15792.86s -> 15794.74s]  Jerma, it's a great finish there.
[15794.74s -> 15796.46s]  That was a big sandwich.
[15796.46s -> 15798.90s]  I played so poorly in the beginning.
[15798.90s -> 15800.38s]  I totally cooked this.
[15800.38s -> 15802.46s]  It's fine. No, no, no, no, no.
[15802.46s -> 15804.62s]  I should I shouldn't have risked it.
[15804.62s -> 15807.28s]  I shouldn't have risked it.
[15807.28s -> 15810.30s]  Claw's not strong here, Jerma.
[15810.30s -> 15812.34s]  You staying with Shaggy?
[15812.34s -> 15813.50s]  No, I'm going to switch it up.
[15813.50s -> 15815.14s]  Choose your character.
[15815.14s -> 15816.94s]  I will, too.
[15817.02s -> 15822.37s]  I'll switch it up to iron giant again,
[15822.37s -> 15823.89s]  even though I'm not very good at it.
[15823.89s -> 15826.66s]  I know he's my last game.
[15826.66s -> 15827.70s]  All right, LG, LG.
[15827.70s -> 15829.94s]  All right.
[15829.94s -> 15832.06s]  I got to get some food.
[15832.06s -> 15833.46s]  No, you kind of nutty low key.
[15833.46s -> 15836.97s]  Thank you for this for the marbles.
[15836.97s -> 15839.37s]  Dude, what sucks is Assan's actually good,
[15839.37s -> 15842.17s]  but he's able to be like, no, I'm a political commentator.
[15842.17s -> 15844.65s]  And so losing four times is bad.
[15844.65s -> 15846.93s]  I'm not good. You're actually good.
[15846.93s -> 15848.85s]  You actually seem to be pretty competent.
[15848.85s -> 15849.97s]  And I think you play well.
[15849.97s -> 15852.09s]  The iron giant is cracked out, though.
[15852.09s -> 15852.49s]  This is going to be hard.
[15852.49s -> 15855.97s]  I have no fucking understanding of how this game operates.
[15855.97s -> 15858.37s]  I'm just literally pressing random buttons, bro.
[15858.37s -> 15861.01s]  Your side B's are godlike.
[15861.01s -> 15864.38s]  No side B's have been clutch.
[15864.38s -> 15867.06s]  What is a side B when you kick someone off the map or something?
[15867.06s -> 15870.34s]  You do your omega kicks that swing left and right very far.
[15870.34s -> 15872.58s]  You do it like Superman and Shaggy.
[15872.58s -> 15877.55s]  Old man Jenkins house again.
[15877.55s -> 15880.19s]  This one is like really technical and I don't know how to do it.
[15880.19s -> 15884.29s]  I don't know how to unlock a bunch of the shit.
[15884.29s -> 15887.48s]  It's going to be really hard to tank.
[15890.81s -> 15901.94s]  I don't even remember what Jake does.
[15901.94s -> 15907.71s]  Oh, fuck. I went the wrong way.
[15907.71s -> 15909.15s]  I remember this ups.
[15909.15s -> 15914.74s]  Oh, geez. Oh, he's in trouble.
[15914.74s -> 15923.72s]  Walls open.
[15923.72s -> 15932.47s]  We've got a burly man done.
[15932.47s -> 15933.87s]  Finish that up.
[15933.87s -> 15935.63s]  Oh, I tried. I tried.
[15935.63s -> 15936.67s]  Oh, come on.
[15936.67s -> 15937.79s]  I got to go. I got to go.
[15937.79s -> 15939.11s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[15939.11s -> 15944.56s]  You live that. Oh, God.
[15944.56s -> 15947.24s]  I can't believe I can't believe that hit me.
[15947.24s -> 15950.67s]  Yeah, it was it was in a bad spot.
[15950.67s -> 15953.39s]  It was like right stuffed in on the left side.
[15953.99s -> 15955.51s]  Grabbing this game?
[15955.51s -> 15957.51s]  No, right? No, only this character can.
[15961.85s -> 15963.57s]  Oh, you got me.
[15963.57s -> 15966.62s]  You got me. I was trying to be sneaky.
[15969.74s -> 15971.78s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[15971.78s -> 15979.34s]  Oh, you fucked me up.
[15979.34s -> 15981.64s]  Oh, I'm going to die soon.
[15981.64s -> 15982.64s]  You can't die.
[15994.98s -> 15997.42s]  How are you a lot like a rag doll?
[15998.42s -> 16000.70s]  Oh, match point.
[16000.70s -> 16001.94s]  Red team.
[16007.38s -> 16009.87s]  Oh, that's right.
[16009.87s -> 16016.20s]  Oh, shit.
[16016.20s -> 16018.60s]  Oh, don't you do it.
[16018.60s -> 16020.76s]  Don't you do it.
[16020.76s -> 16024.44s]  Oh, no. What?
[16024.44s -> 16031.20s]  He came out. No.
[16031.20s -> 16034.95s]  Oh, no.
[16034.95s -> 16037.19s]  Oh, finish it up and finish it up.
[16037.19s -> 16040.24s]  I'm trying to grab. I'm trying to grab it.
[16040.24s -> 16042.08s]  Yes. Oh, it's not.
[16042.08s -> 16043.36s]  It's over. Oh, fuck.
[16043.36s -> 16045.81s]  He got out of it. How?
[16045.81s -> 16046.85s]  He's so close.
[16046.85s -> 16048.85s]  Get it. Oh,
[16051.69s -> 16053.81s]  I couldn't get there in time.
[16053.81s -> 16055.69s]  Fuck. Oh, my God.
[16055.69s -> 16056.69s]  Unlucky.
[16058.70s -> 16062.10s]  That right side broke at the worst possible time.
[16062.10s -> 16064.42s]  Oh, dude, the amount of damage.
[16064.42s -> 16067.62s]  Bro, what was I doing?
[16067.62s -> 16069.98s]  Damn, Hassan was stacking on those.
[16069.98s -> 16075.70s]  You just stand still and spin and grab a hundred damage.
[16075.70s -> 16077.02s]  But I don't just kill.
[16077.02s -> 16080.14s]  Yeah, I couldn't finish off Jerma at the end there.
[16080.14s -> 16081.94s]  I got I got towards the end.
[16081.94s -> 16083.02s]  It was so close.
[16083.02s -> 16085.42s]  I was trying to grab him so I can fucking do the toss.
[16085.42s -> 16087.42s]  But it's your it's your job, right, Charlie?
[16087.42s -> 16089.66s]  Because I don't think Iron Giant can even kill.
[16089.66s -> 16091.22s]  I don't know. I don't know anything about Iron Giant.
[16091.22s -> 16092.26s]  I bounced around.
[16092.26s -> 16094.66s]  I bounced up, down, up, down like three times at the end.
[16094.66s -> 16097.38s]  If that roof was any if it was if
[16097.38s -> 16100.06s]  there for any shorter, I would be dead.
[16100.06s -> 16101.94s]  Yeah, the map, the map definitely was a bit.
[16101.94s -> 16104.26s]  It's a bit of a map gap there.
[16104.26s -> 16105.78s]  That was that was awesome. That was a lot of fun.
[16105.78s -> 16108.02s]  All right. Same time next week.
[16108.02s -> 16109.50s]  Yeah. Same time next week, boys.
[16109.50s -> 16111.44s]  Multi versus. Let's go.
[16111.44s -> 16115.21s]  I will grind every single day, eight hours a day.
[16115.21s -> 16118.85s]  Hey, man, maybe maybe next time we 1v1 like you can actually,
[16118.85s -> 16121.13s]  I don't know, be competitive.
[16121.13s -> 16125.93s]  I'm going to lie in bed, eyes wide open, thinking about every single hit
[16125.93s -> 16128.49s]  that happens. He's going to read the what's the
[16128.53s -> 16129.77s]  God damn it. I saw it on Twitter.
[16129.77s -> 16134.73s]  People were reading like the medas or your list to skip it ahead.
[16134.73s -> 16137.61s]  I'm just going to get Andrew Tate's Hustler University course.
[16137.61s -> 16139.33s]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[16139.33s -> 16141.85s]  I'm coming back a top G or I'm not coming back at all.
[16142.85s -> 16144.29s]  That's a wiki, bro.
[16144.29s -> 16145.45s]  I see you guys later.
[16145.45s -> 16147.01s]  A lot of fun. Thanks. Yeah.
[16147.01s -> 16148.29s]  Thank you. A lot of fun.
[16148.29s -> 16151.01s]  This is about the tech errors.
[16151.74s -> 16153.18s]  No, that was that was a lot of fun.
[16153.18s -> 16154.68s]  We should do it again sometime.
[16154.68s -> 16157.58s]  Absolutely. That was good to me.
[16157.58s -> 16159.14s]  Take it easy, guys. Have a good night.
[16159.14s -> 16162.87s]  See you later. That's fun.
[16162.87s -> 16166.80s]  That's fun. That's fun.
[16166.80s -> 16168.74s]  Yeah. So that's multiverses.
[16168.74s -> 16171.82s]  Again, thanks to Warner Brothers Interactive for sponsoring the stream.
[16171.82s -> 16173.58s]  We played it for a long time.
[16173.58s -> 16176.54s]  How long was this? How long was I playing?
[16176.54s -> 16180.80s]  Six hours. Damn.
[16180.80s -> 16183.63s]  Hope you had fun streaming for long enough.
[16183.63s -> 16187.87s]  Hopefully some of you guys got the drop into early access.
[16192.04s -> 16198.41s]  Damn, it feels good sometimes just playing that.
[16198.41s -> 16199.53s]  I'll see you guys later.
[16199.53s -> 16204.38s]  I will see you guys on Friday for Sorcery.
[16204.94s -> 16210.28s]  We're going back to Sorcery this weekend for one million Twitch followers.
[16210.52s -> 16213.93s]  It's one of the first games I ever played on stream.
[16213.93s -> 16217.00s]  Should be a good time to hang out and chill.
[16217.00s -> 16218.83s]  We're going back to Sorcery.
[16218.83s -> 16220.51s]  But those of you that weren't here at the beginning of the stream.
[16220.51s -> 16224.70s]  Yeah, we're going back to Sorcery.
[16224.70s -> 16226.94s]  And then green screen movie night is Sunday.
[16228.50s -> 16232.64s]  So we got some pretty fun stuff coming up this weekend.
[16232.64s -> 16234.56s]  Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[16234.56s -> 16236.87s]  There was a lot of people here earlier.
[16236.87s -> 16239.22s]  Hopefully it was entertaining.
[16239.22s -> 16242.50s]  It was a really cool opportunity, so I'm glad I was able to do it.
[16243.42s -> 16245.50s]  Thanks again to Warner Brothers Interactive.
[16247.14s -> 16249.09s]  Good night. Goodbye.
[16249.09s -> 16254.48s]  Well, actually, we'll do this to the actual leaving thing.
[16258.17s -> 16260.82s]  Obviously, thanks for the subs.
[16260.82s -> 16264.34s]  I think if they're still playing, go spread out to their channels.
[16264.94s -> 16270.50s]  Obviously, Hassan, Charlie Ludwig.
[16270.50s -> 16272.23s]  I think they're probably going to keep playing.
[16272.23s -> 16275.17s]  Go spread out, go hang out.
[16275.17s -> 16277.13s]  Not going to raid anybody in particular, I don't think.
[16281.25s -> 16283.55s]  I don't have the drop yet. No.
[16283.55s -> 16285.50s]  How much more time do you need?
[16285.50s -> 16287.58s]  How much do you need? Like five minutes, two minutes.
[16287.98s -> 16291.47s]  How much more time for the drop?
[16291.47s -> 16294.47s]  I think there are the streamers that are doing this that have the drop enabled.
[16294.47s -> 16298.28s]  So you can just do it there, too.
[16298.28s -> 16306.14s]  I want just a carry over. Oh, my I'm like a lightning rod right now.
[16306.14s -> 16307.50s]  I just like gaming, man.
[16307.50s -> 16310.70s]  Just playing games and just like, oh, that like kind of bottled up
[16311.66s -> 16313.74s]  gamer energy, you know, you know, you know, I'm talking about, right?
[16315.14s -> 16326.54s]  It feels good. It does carry over.
[16326.54s -> 16328.42s]  You don't need to do it in one go. Oh, there you go.
[16328.42s -> 16330.30s]  So just go watch somebody else that has drops enabled.
[16335.19s -> 16337.63s]  We will absolutely be playing this again.
[16337.63s -> 16346.96s]  There's not a chance I don't do this again.
[16346.96s -> 16348.72s]  You turn 25 during this stream.
[16348.72s -> 16350.84s]  Well, happy birthday. Happy 25th birthday.
[16351.74s -> 16362.66s]  Come on. I just burped. Yeah.
[16362.66s -> 16365.78s]  And we'll see you Friday. Good night. Goodbye.
[16366.02s -> 16367.74s]  Take care of yourselves.
[16367.74s -> 16371.36s]  Call your mother. You know how it works.
[16371.36s -> 16371.92s]  Thanks for watching.
[16371.92s -> 16374.48s]  Thanks for supporting the stream, all the subs, obviously.
[16375.59s -> 16377.90s]  Have a great night. See you later.
