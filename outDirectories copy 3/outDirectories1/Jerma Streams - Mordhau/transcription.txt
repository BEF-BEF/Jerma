[1.59s -> 12.38s]  Hey there, hi. How's it going? People watching the Vaught have no idea about what. I wasn't late,
[12.38s -> 28.39s]  I was there exactly at 3.59 p.m. Yeah, I was just talking to Mr. Italics. He expressed interest
[29.54s -> 34.89s]  in hopping in a little later. He's like, yeah, I kind of want to play. So I was like, yeah,
[34.89s -> 47.66s]  whatever. So we might see him in an hour or two. Maybe sooner, we'll see. Tell him you don't
[47.66s -> 57.05s]  want it. That's like so rude. Why would I do that? Hey man, yeah, like it's a game that has
[57.05s -> 64.06s]  multiplayer and stuff. Like, yeah, I'll play with you. No, I don't want you. That's like, why?
[65.02s -> 71.53s]  It's like a co-op game, isn't it? What are you fucking talking about? Anywho,
[71.53s -> 76.65s]  hi guys. Yeah, here's the plan. We're gonna do Mordhau. I hope I'm saying that right.
[76.73s -> 83.35s]  Probably not, but you know, one guy said that. You must be new here.
[87.10s -> 94.41s]  5,000 of you could write the same sentence and I wouldn't see it. They would be one person
[94.41s -> 100.57s]  in between that 5,000 sentences of the same sentence and I would read that one out loud.
[101.64s -> 107.24s]  It's like my brain finds patterns and then the ghost for the thing that's not the pattern.
[107.80s -> 117.35s]  I'm always connecting patterns with words and language. So, but yeah, we're gonna do Mordhau
[117.35s -> 123.11s]  tonight. I don't know how long we'll do this for. Who knows? I might get addicted to this game and
[123.11s -> 128.73s]  it might be the only thing I play. You know, I think I'm gonna get so good at this game. I'm
[128.73s -> 133.05s]  gonna play it so much. I'm gonna make a movie. I'm gonna make a game. I'm gonna make a horror
[133.05s -> 137.86s]  game in Mordhau too. I'm gonna spend all night playing Mordhau and like that's all
[137.86s -> 141.86s]  I'm gonna do. And then tomorrow you'll see some more Mordhau of me of what I've been
[141.86s -> 151.66s]  able to come up with. But no, it's that Dreams is a lot deeper of a game. I want to spend more time
[151.66s -> 157.91s]  with it. So what we're gonna do with Dreams is we're gonna spend... That's a new lie.
[157.91s -> 163.37s]  No, it's not a new lie. It was never a lie in the first place. Did you look at the tutorials
[163.37s -> 170.02s]  for Dreams? Yes. I did look at them. I looked at them. There's quite a few of them. I looked
[170.02s -> 175.34s]  at them. I mean, I didn't do any of them. I looked at them though and I looked at them.
[175.98s -> 182.71s]  Now we got a tutorial. Speaking of tutorials, we've got one to do here. So we might as well
[182.71s -> 190.23s]  hurry this up. So let's go ahead and get that off. I don't have the camera on right now.
[190.23s -> 198.79s]  Hey, look at that. This is Mordhau. It is a first person medieval multiplayer action
[198.79s -> 207.02s]  attack each other game. Looks like fun. A lot of people were requesting this yesterday,
[207.02s -> 213.21s]  so I figured I'd give it a try. And let me make sure the audio is okay. Make sure
[213.21s -> 219.82s]  it's not too loud. It is probably way too loud. You're gonna have to tell me. You're
[219.82s -> 230.50s]  gonna have to yell at me. It's probably a little bit better. That's okay. So I have no
[230.50s -> 237.22s]  idea how this works. We get 2,500 bucks when we complete it. So let's play it.
[239.22s -> 248.66s]  Go. Takes approximately 15 minutes. Now that's the kind of tutorial I like. Only 15 minutes.
[248.66s -> 256.10s]  Hold on. I gotta fucking stall for a second so I can tweet it. I do this thing where I
[256.10s -> 260.90s]  make a tweet before and then I accidentally just cancel the tweet and then have to redo it.
[260.90s -> 271.46s]  What I'm saying is, I'm just fucking not intelligent. It's all been a lie. I had two
[271.46s -> 278.95s]  IQ tests. Yes, I did. It was very bad. And I just tell everybody on the internet that I'm
[278.95s -> 291.86s]  smart so people think that I'm smart. Don't you understand? Oh, okay. Mordhau. Landlord?
[292.58s -> 302.46s]  No, lardlord. I should just change it to landlord. Why is it lardlord?
[304.39s -> 315.48s]  Twitch.tv. Why is this pre-recorded? I don't understand. How can you guys
[315.48s -> 320.74s]  determine that? What makes something pre-recorded? What is it? What does it take?
[325.75s -> 329.43s]  Is this the way I'm talking? Like, okay, so let me type this in.
[329.43s -> 332.54s]  Is it? Press end for a new beginning.
[337.67s -> 338.47s]  I'm fucking huge.
[338.47s -> 342.79s]  Go on. Look around. This is the place where I'll teach you how to fight without stopping
[342.79s -> 347.75s]  yourself in the process. P is first person. Okay, hold on. This is sensitivity. It's way
[347.75s -> 352.15s]  too high. All right. That's quite enough sightseeing for now. Eyes on me, you two.
[353.35s -> 355.75s]  Mouse x-axis? Oh, should I hate when they do this?
[358.46s -> 362.38s]  I can never get this right. I always accidentally make it like two points higher.
[363.02s -> 365.85s]  It's gotta be lower than that. All the pros told me.
[368.14s -> 374.90s]  Point fifty point fifty. Right? That's better.
[375.98s -> 379.34s]  Might need maybe a little bit higher. Okay, go back. Go back to first person.
[379.34s -> 384.06s]  This is a real battlefield, but don't be alarmed. We're perfectly safe at the moment.
[387.64s -> 389.24s]  That seems to happen quite frequently.
[390.28s -> 392.20s]  Where's your sword, recruit?
[392.20s -> 394.84s]  Where's your sword? Sword!
[394.84s -> 398.04s]  Get down to it. Hit dummy three times.
[398.04s -> 403.86s]  Dummy. That's not the dummy. The dummy's behind me.
[405.14s -> 409.54s]  Left mouse button to perform an attack. Here's the... oh, look at that. That's the direction
[409.54s -> 417.94s]  that you go. So you come from each angle.
[428.74s -> 431.54s]  Press the left mouse button to perform an attack. While that attack is halfway through,
[431.54s -> 433.78s]  press the left mouse button again to execute another follow-up attack.
[437.93s -> 438.25s]  Easy enough.
[454.01s -> 455.94s]  All right, he's fine.
[458.42s -> 461.94s]  Holy shit. I fucking slit his throat like five times.
[463.46s -> 465.14s]  Oh, what a classic Jerva joke!
[467.82s -> 473.27s]  Again, one more. I played enough Sekiro to know how to do this.
[474.23s -> 480.76s]  Good. If you quickly toime your attacks after a parry, you will perform a repost.
[480.76s -> 484.04s]  A quick follow-up attack that will catch your opponents by surprise.
[485.72s -> 487.40s]  Toimen is crucial. Toimen.
[487.40s -> 492.12s]  You must perform the attack slightly before or exactly at the time of the block.
[492.12s -> 494.04s]  Parry my attack. Right before. Okay.
[495.16s -> 498.04s]  Here we go. Excellent repost.
[498.04s -> 500.12s]  Jesus. One more thing about parrying it.
[500.52s -> 506.04s]  It only lasts a short while. The way you turn your hips can make your weapon hit sooner or later.
[506.04s -> 509.48s]  This can be used to create an effect and throw off your opponent's toimen.
[509.48s -> 512.76s]  Try to block three of my strikes as I turn in and out of them.
[513.64s -> 514.76s]  Okay. Good.
[517.80s -> 522.81s]  One more. You're only coming from one direction.
[522.81s -> 525.53s]  Make sure you have the stamina to perform a parry.
[525.53s -> 527.61s]  Otherwise, you might end up losing your weapon.
[527.61s -> 528.49s]  Oh, stamina.
[529.13s -> 530.33s]  Parry my next attack.
[531.70s -> 533.94s]  Ha! Like stealing candy from a baby.
[533.94s -> 534.74s]  He just took my...
[534.74s -> 536.42s]  I'm not your butler.
[536.42s -> 538.82s]  Oh, we're getting a classic fucking Jerva YouTube joke.
[539.70s -> 544.02s]  So that's E. If you have no...
[544.02s -> 547.14s]  Pick it up. If you have no inventory space, press G to drop what you're carrying.
[547.14s -> 551.46s]  Let's see if you can do more than just mindlessly quail around with that weapon.
[551.46s -> 554.34s]  We will start with a simple horizontal strike.
[554.34s -> 554.42s]  I see.
[554.42s -> 557.14s]  Chop that stick up with three horizontal slashes.
[557.22s -> 559.22s]  Okay.
[559.22s -> 564.10s]  Move your mouse slightly to the left or right and press left mouse button to execute a horizontal attack.
[564.10s -> 564.34s]  Yeah.
[564.34s -> 564.90s]  Good.
[566.26s -> 569.43s]  So you kind of just...
[569.43s -> 570.15s]  Like that.
[570.15s -> 570.55s]  I see.
[571.51s -> 572.50s]  One more.
[575.10s -> 576.46s]  Does it matter if I take the thing off?
[578.65s -> 579.93s]  Is there a way I can make that slower?
[579.93s -> 582.65s]  I feel like it's really erratic.
[582.65s -> 584.73s]  It's like holding a compass and spinning around in a circle.
[586.78s -> 588.70s]  Move your mouse slightly upwards and...
[588.70s -> 589.10s]  Upwards.
[589.10s -> 589.58s]  See what I mean?
[589.58s -> 589.98s]  It's like...
[590.46s -> 590.86s]  Yeah!
[591.74s -> 594.47s]  I feel like someone's holding a magnet up to my fucking compass.
[594.47s -> 594.79s]  All right.
[595.51s -> 597.02s]  So anyway, where's the pumpkin again?
[599.90s -> 601.02s]  Good job.
[601.02s -> 605.18s]  Next we have the stab, which is an attack that allows you for precise hits.
[605.18s -> 606.78s]  Stab that cabbage over there.
[607.58s -> 608.06s]  See what I mean?
[608.06s -> 608.46s]  It's kind of...
[610.55s -> 611.27s]  Stab.
[611.27s -> 612.23s]  Mouse wheel up.
[613.11s -> 614.22s]  Interesting.
[614.78s -> 616.38s]  Nice farming, recruit.
[616.38s -> 617.82s]  Almost missed the pumpkin.
[617.82s -> 619.98s]  Most weapons have an alternate mode of use.
[619.98s -> 622.14s]  What's that show where they cut shit?
[623.10s -> 627.66s]  They make the sword and then they have to cut a bunch of stuff and run around and
[627.66s -> 630.30s]  get winded hitting like meat and chickens and stuff?
[631.34s -> 632.90s]  No, not Fruit Ninja.
[632.90s -> 634.26s]  It's an actual show on TV.
[635.22s -> 641.91s]  Okay, so R to switch weapon mode.
[643.43s -> 644.71s]  Why the hell would I hold it like this?
[645.67s -> 649.11s]  Hit the dummy on the helmet.
[649.75s -> 650.23s]  Why?
[650.87s -> 652.47s]  You're not supposed to hold a sword like this.
[659.99s -> 661.83s]  Kicks cannot be blocked by a parry.
[661.83s -> 663.43s]  Kicks can't be blocked, right?
[663.43s -> 664.55s]  That makes sense.
[664.55s -> 665.43s]  Forged in fire.
[665.43s -> 665.91s]  That's the one.
[667.19s -> 670.31s]  You can defend yourself against kicks by performing a kick yourself.
[670.31s -> 671.91s]  So you can block a kick with a kick.
[671.91s -> 673.83s]  Kicks by kicking right before I hit you.
[675.72s -> 676.52s]  Good block.
[676.52s -> 677.00s]  Another.
[677.56s -> 678.52s]  I want to rebind that.
[678.52s -> 679.56s]  All right, all right.
[679.56s -> 679.80s]  Okay.
[680.52s -> 681.16s]  I don't want that as F.
[681.16s -> 685.56s]  Sometimes it's a good idea to cancel an attack before it is fully committed.
[685.56s -> 687.88s]  This can trick your opponents into firing early.
[687.88s -> 688.60s]  I can't pause it.
[688.60s -> 691.40s]  Can only cancel an attack before it is fully committed.
[691.40s -> 693.00s]  So don't wait too long.
[693.00s -> 696.76s]  Get around my defense three times by tricking me into parrying it.
[696.76s -> 699.72s]  Left mouse button to start and then just after press Q to faint.
[700.52s -> 701.16s]  All right, okay.
[702.28s -> 704.44s]  Press 9 to skip this tutorial stage.
[705.32s -> 709.14s]  All right, I get a follow up but it's okay.
[710.42s -> 711.22s]  Well played.
[712.18s -> 715.50s]  Snakey.
[716.54s -> 717.18s]  Snakey.
[718.14s -> 718.94s]  Well done.
[719.82s -> 722.62s]  This kind of reminds me of if For Honor was cool.
[722.70s -> 724.22s]  Form an attack morph.
[724.22s -> 724.70s]  Or cooler.
[724.70s -> 728.06s]  Only morph from strike to stab or vice versa.
[728.06s -> 732.78s]  To perform a morph, start an attack and then start another attack shortly after.
[732.78s -> 733.58s]  Morph an attack.
[733.58s -> 738.06s]  This will morph the original attack into the new one and throw off your opponent's sense of toying.
[739.10s -> 741.50s]  Get around my defense three times by tricking me with a morph.
[741.50s -> 743.58s]  Okay, you can morph from strike to stab.
[743.58s -> 747.02s]  So stab just press left mouse button before strike and then quickly mouse wheel up.
[748.22s -> 749.02s]  Well played.
[749.02s -> 749.82s]  Okay.
[749.82s -> 751.26s]  So you can do the same thing in reverse.
[752.22s -> 753.03s]  Snakey.
[753.03s -> 753.53s]  Yeah.
[754.07s -> 757.85s]  That's enough.
[757.85s -> 758.41s]  Cool.
[758.41s -> 759.29s]  You can go back and forth.
[759.29s -> 761.77s]  I'll show you an advanced maneuver called chambering next.
[761.77s -> 765.93s]  Instead of parrying, you can mirror my attacks with your own attack.
[765.93s -> 768.57s]  If you do this just before the attack hits you,
[768.57s -> 771.61s]  it'll act as both as a block and a counter attack.
[771.61s -> 773.61s]  All right, we'll do it in the same direction.
[773.61s -> 775.29s]  You must learn to successfully chamber.
[775.29s -> 778.01s]  I will perform a left horizontal slash,
[778.01s -> 783.13s]  which you must counter by performing a right horizontal slash just before I hit you.
[783.13s -> 783.77s]  Get ready.
[784.17s -> 785.45s]  Okay, right horizontal right.
[786.65s -> 787.69s]  Well, I didn't do it right.
[789.91s -> 790.63s]  Got to be quick.
[792.50s -> 793.06s]  Wait, what?
[797.75s -> 798.23s]  Wait, hold on.
[798.23s -> 800.63s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[800.63s -> 803.99s]  Perform a right slash right before the weapon reaches you.
[812.09s -> 812.81s]  Oh, okay.
[812.81s -> 813.37s]  I get it.
[813.37s -> 815.05s]  I thought I was going to like Darth Vader.
[817.42s -> 819.90s]  I thought it was going to be going to do the lightsaber connect thing.
[822.38s -> 823.42s]  It's right when you get hit.
[825.50s -> 827.02s]  It's literally right before it touches you.
[830.71s -> 831.83s]  All right, let's see.
[831.83s -> 835.27s]  Now apply all that you have learned and land five strikes on me.
[835.27s -> 837.11s]  For this time, I won't hold back.
[838.47s -> 844.06s]  Come here.
[850.06s -> 857.70s]  Good, again.
[857.70s -> 865.46s]  God damn, this is fucking crazy.
[866.34s -> 872.04s]  So there's only, you can only parry for a second.
[872.76s -> 880.46s]  Uh-oh, died to the instructor.
[881.58s -> 883.90s]  Uh-oh, died to the instructor.
[896.50s -> 901.43s]  One more, not much worth it for the fight.
[901.43s -> 903.43s]  Hey squirts, thanks for the five community subs.
[903.43s -> 907.14s]  It's time to play with some new toys.
[907.14s -> 908.18s]  Hold G to guard.
[908.18s -> 908.98s]  Oh, isn't that funny?
[909.54s -> 912.50s]  You ain't going to get me on that one.
[912.50s -> 912.98s]  I'm sorry.
[913.62s -> 920.34s]  You know, I could, I might be dense, but I'm not thick.
[920.98s -> 924.55s]  I have a really heavy brain, not a thick brain.
[926.55s -> 928.30s]  All right, so pick up a bow.
[929.10s -> 930.14s]  You kind of have to get out of the way.
[930.86s -> 934.95s]  You asshole.
[934.95s -> 935.99s]  Supposed to be the instructor.
[935.99s -> 936.71s]  Get out of my way.
[937.43s -> 938.66s]  All right, let's get the bow.
[939.38s -> 939.86s]  And there it is.
[939.86s -> 940.82s]  There's my bread and butter.
[942.71s -> 943.67s]  Oh, bread and butter.
[945.35s -> 946.23s]  He said bread and butter.
[946.23s -> 947.19s]  He says that all the time.
[950.20s -> 951.08s]  What's the drop like?
[953.11s -> 953.99s]  Outer circle.
[955.05s -> 956.01s]  It's not bad.
[958.79s -> 959.59s]  Outer circle.
[962.71s -> 963.99s]  Let's see, how high?
[963.99s -> 964.95s]  Outer circle.
[964.95s -> 966.47s]  No, is there, is there any drop?
[966.47s -> 969.05s]  Oh well, you're not blind after all.
[969.05s -> 970.81s]  I want some real shots now.
[970.81s -> 973.13s]  Hit that medium range target three times.
[973.13s -> 974.57s]  First of all, left mouse button, start drawing the bow,
[974.57s -> 975.45s]  and release when ready to fire.
[975.45s -> 978.33s]  If you run out of ammo, you can restock from the ammo box to your left.
[978.33s -> 978.83s]  Cool.
[982.26s -> 983.62s]  Far outer circle.
[983.62s -> 984.66s]  Far outer circle, okay.
[987.61s -> 988.81s]  Far outer circle.
[988.81s -> 990.25s]  No, so it is a little higher than that.
[990.25s -> 991.05s]  Let's see.
[991.05s -> 991.77s]  Like up here?
[992.65s -> 993.21s]  Inner circle.
[993.21s -> 993.93s]  There it is, yeah.
[993.93s -> 995.29s]  It's not, it's really not that much.
[996.41s -> 998.09s]  Want to prove me wrong?
[998.09s -> 1000.01s]  Three hits on the far target.
[1000.01s -> 1000.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[1007.00s -> 1009.40s]  Ah, too bad.
[1012.89s -> 1013.77s]  Far outer circle.
[1013.77s -> 1019.82s]  Ah, no, it's a little bit lower.
[1020.46s -> 1021.58s]  It drops right at the end.
[1023.35s -> 1024.39s]  Far outer circle.
[1024.39s -> 1025.51s]  No, give me an inner circle.
[1029.06s -> 1030.02s]  Far outer circle.
[1030.02s -> 1031.06s]  No, fuck you.
[1031.06s -> 1033.78s]  Okay, okay, I'll admit, you're a natural.
[1033.86s -> 1039.78s]  However, what separates a true marksman from a talented amateur is the Hanz test.
[1040.90s -> 1043.94s]  What separates a true amateur, as you've been able to tell,
[1043.94s -> 1045.54s]  I have a really dense brain.
[1046.49s -> 1047.93s]  No arrow, what?
[1047.93s -> 1051.37s]  I have to shoot this guy?
[1060.65s -> 1062.89s]  Is this the guy screaming running around a field?
[1064.36s -> 1066.28s]  This guy's harder than an actual video game.
[1066.28s -> 1067.96s]  He's like the ducks.
[1067.96s -> 1080.20s]  I'll get him right here.
[1080.20s -> 1082.28s]  This is actually really hard to hit somebody.
[1083.22s -> 1084.58s]  Splendid shot.
[1084.58s -> 1085.22s]  Don't worry.
[1087.16s -> 1088.44s]  He's at wars.
[1088.44s -> 1089.16s]  Follow me.
[1089.16s -> 1090.44s]  I have a surprise for you.
[1091.32s -> 1092.73s]  A surprise?
[1095.48s -> 1098.15s]  Hopefully, you're not afraid of horses.
[1098.15s -> 1099.27s]  Pick up that lance.
[1100.39s -> 1101.91s]  How much is there to do in this game?
[1102.79s -> 1107.19s]  The lance is useless on foot, but it is devastating on horseback.
[1107.19s -> 1108.47s]  Now hop onto the horse.
[1113.21s -> 1113.71s]  Jesus.
[1115.93s -> 1118.17s]  Press F while riding fast to start.
[1118.17s -> 1119.61s]  All right, we got to get F out of here.
[1120.57s -> 1122.63s]  Yeah, we got to get F the hell out of here.
[1122.63s -> 1122.95s]  Hold on.
[1123.67s -> 1125.78s]  I got to change that to a mouse button.
[1128.06s -> 1128.78s]  Key bindings.
[1129.86s -> 1131.06s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1131.06s -> 1131.94s]  What's F?
[1131.94s -> 1132.74s]  Kick?
[1132.74s -> 1134.98s]  I want this to be this button.
[1134.98s -> 1135.70s]  Yeah, whatever.
[1137.66s -> 1139.66s]  Upper right strike, lower right strike.
[1139.66s -> 1140.62s]  I think, do I need to know?
[1140.62s -> 1141.74s]  Do we need to have this shit?
[1142.70s -> 1151.34s]  All right, press thumb mouse button while riding fast to start a crouched attack.
[1151.98s -> 1156.73s]  Okay.
[1156.73s -> 1158.20s]  Hit the dummies.
[1158.20s -> 1159.24s]  Oh, I have to hit the dummies.
[1159.80s -> 1167.56s]  So do I have to hold it or just press it?
[1167.56s -> 1169.05s]  Probably have to hold it.
[1180.90s -> 1182.34s]  Uh, what?
[1188.20s -> 1189.16s]  Just get me off the horse.
[1189.16s -> 1190.12s]  I'll never be on it.
[1190.12s -> 1191.16s]  I'm never going to use the horse.
[1194.30s -> 1197.82s]  Uh, so you just have to be...
[1197.82s -> 1198.86s]  How fast do you have to be going?
[1199.42s -> 1203.38s]  I have to hold it.
[1203.38s -> 1204.02s]  I'm holding it.
[1204.02s -> 1204.98s]  Okay, I'm holding it now.
[1207.11s -> 1208.95s]  You know, okay, it'll only last for a certain amount of time.
[1209.59s -> 1212.78s]  Now you actually have to pull the...
[1212.78s -> 1216.57s]  Your hand out like this.
[1218.78s -> 1219.90s]  You don't just have to aim down.
[1219.90s -> 1220.94s]  You have to like pull...
[1220.94s -> 1221.90s]  Or don't fall off the horse.
[1221.90s -> 1222.78s]  This isn't red dead.
[1225.74s -> 1227.38s]  I got to turn around.
[1227.38s -> 1229.06s]  I wish I had a more open field for this.
[1229.86s -> 1231.30s]  They're kind of like sticky in the middle of here.
[1231.86s -> 1237.21s]  It's hard to control this too.
[1244.06s -> 1250.15s]  What?
[1250.15s -> 1250.47s]  Why?
[1251.19s -> 1253.27s]  How is that missing?
[1253.27s -> 1253.51s]  What?
[1260.17s -> 1261.21s]  Oh, get me off this thing.
[1266.02s -> 1271.58s]  Quit horsing around.
[1271.58s -> 1272.14s]  That was funny.
[1272.14s -> 1272.86s]  Come on.
[1272.86s -> 1273.50s]  Give him that one.
[1275.83s -> 1277.19s]  Just don't do that in the game.
[1279.64s -> 1281.96s]  I'm not gonna because I'm not going to be a horseback person.
[1281.96s -> 1285.58s]  I'm going to be a assassin.
[1285.58s -> 1286.54s]  That's my character.
[1288.31s -> 1290.15s]  And I'm going to roleplay on Mike the whole time.
[1302.39s -> 1304.47s]  I mean, what I meant to say is I'm going to be axe guy.
[1306.33s -> 1307.61s]  Axe guy doesn't go on a horse.
[1308.33s -> 1309.05s]  He runs.
[1321.99s -> 1323.75s]  That guy doesn't get on the back of the horse.
[1328.10s -> 1328.60s]  Hey!
[1331.00s -> 1332.20s]  What the fuck is that for?
[1334.94s -> 1337.34s]  All right, I'm going to be meat tenderizer guy.
[1337.98s -> 1343.91s]  So I have to repair both doors?
[1344.55s -> 1347.18s]  Well, that seems fairly...
[1348.06s -> 1349.10s]  This probably costs money.
[1367.05s -> 1367.77s]  Longsword.
[1370.81s -> 1371.93s]  Oh, a trebuchet.
[1376.33s -> 1389.21s]  How are you...
[1390.25s -> 1393.29s]  Mouse wheel down, mouse wheel up to increase the disc...
[1393.29s -> 1395.53s]  Okay, to increase and decrease the power of the shot.
[1396.65s -> 1398.78s]  This is just golf all over again.
[1398.78s -> 1399.90s]  I'm not going to play this either.
[1399.90s -> 1401.34s]  I'm not going to touch this because this is golf.
[1401.98s -> 1403.42s]  And you see how bad I was at golf.
[1424.15s -> 1424.47s]  I got it.
[1428.15s -> 1428.39s]  Okay.
[1429.99s -> 1431.27s]  Take out the middle one.
[1431.27s -> 1432.55s]  Increase the middle one.
[1432.55s -> 1433.19s]  That one there.
[1434.39s -> 1438.28s]  That's way too far.
[1441.35s -> 1441.83s]  Damn it.
[1444.81s -> 1447.45s]  Do you want to point blank him in the face with this, can I?
[1449.43s -> 1450.07s]  No, you can't.
[1450.71s -> 1452.17s]  What if I just...
[1452.17s -> 1453.45s]  Okay, what if I just go closer?
[1454.01s -> 1459.51s]  Hold on.
[1459.51s -> 1464.41s]  Can I just seriously disintegrate his head?
[1468.38s -> 1469.50s]  No, that's not going to work.
[1469.50s -> 1470.22s]  Just fuck that.
[1470.22s -> 1471.10s]  I'm just going to go down here.
[1471.66s -> 1482.86s]  Oh, god damn it.
[1482.86s -> 1483.74s]  I just ruined everything.
[1486.28s -> 1488.20s]  I'm stuck and he's actually in the way.
[1491.61s -> 1492.41s]  Just back it up.
[1492.41s -> 1493.37s]  I can't move this now.
[1497.98s -> 1498.70s]  There we go.
[1498.70s -> 1499.42s]  Okay, all right, all right.
[1499.42s -> 1500.38s]  Easy, easy, easy.
[1500.38s -> 1504.97s]  All right, turn.
[1505.77s -> 1507.05s]  Right there is fine.
[1507.05s -> 1516.84s]  How are you supposed to hit this shit?
[1526.55s -> 1527.91s]  I was going to say, if that wasn't it.
[1529.91s -> 1530.87s]  Oh, god damn it.
[1535.88s -> 1536.68s]  First try, get it.
[1539.64s -> 1539.96s]  Yeah!
[1551.64s -> 1552.92s]  Wait, let's throw one more rocket.
[1553.08s -> 1559.00s]  All right, so everyone that was asking, well, what the hell happened to Sam and Max
[1559.00s -> 1560.28s]  and what happened to Dreams?
[1561.00s -> 1563.08s]  Dreams is not something I can...
[1563.08s -> 1564.12s]  Okay, here we go.
[1564.12s -> 1565.24s]  Quote, start now.
[1566.04s -> 1568.92s]  Dreams is not something that I can make something worth doing
[1568.92s -> 1571.48s]  and worth streaming in one day.
[1571.48s -> 1572.92s]  I need to go through all the tutorials
[1572.92s -> 1575.16s]  and really get the knowledge of the program
[1575.96s -> 1578.12s]  and make something more than one thing
[1578.12s -> 1580.28s]  over the course of the next four or five days.
[1580.28s -> 1581.88s]  Now, what does that mean for you?
[1582.60s -> 1585.80s]  I'm going to hold a community event, maybe a week from now,
[1586.36s -> 1587.24s]  where we can...
[1587.24s -> 1591.24s]  Whoever has Dreams can make something with the hashtag Jerma
[1591.24s -> 1594.76s]  or Jerma in the title and we will watch it all
[1594.76s -> 1597.48s]  and play through them all in a week.
[1598.04s -> 1601.69s]  That's what's going to happen with Dreams
[1601.69s -> 1605.83s]  and I will be contributing as well.
[1605.83s -> 1606.79s]  That's what happened to Dreams.
[1606.79s -> 1608.15s]  That's why it's not here right now.
[1608.15s -> 1614.26s]  A week isn't enough time.
[1615.88s -> 1617.00s]  Well, then two weeks, I don't know.
[1619.51s -> 1626.06s]  We'll figure it out.
[1626.06s -> 1627.42s]  Why does this take so long?
[1627.42s -> 1632.02s]  So there's a Battle Royale mode, from my understanding.
[1636.84s -> 1639.00s]  Isn't enough people willing to learn Dreams.
[1639.00s -> 1639.80s]  It's hard.
[1641.67s -> 1642.63s]  Wait, didn't I just do this?
[1643.35s -> 1648.20s]  Where's my money?
[1653.69s -> 1654.89s]  Hey, what?
[1655.61s -> 1657.86s]  Why do I have zero dollars?
[1669.06s -> 1670.42s]  Okay, Battle Royale.
[1670.42s -> 1670.90s]  What should I do?
[1670.90s -> 1671.78s]  Battle VR?
[1673.08s -> 1673.88s]  Europe?
[1673.88s -> 1675.93s]  Oh, it's West.
[1677.00s -> 1679.80s]  Horde mode, frontline Battle Royale.
[1679.80s -> 1680.68s]  This is the first time...
[1680.68s -> 1681.72s]  Okay, let me tell you something.
[1682.44s -> 1686.04s]  This is the first time I have ever played a Battle Royale game.
[1686.60s -> 1689.24s]  On this stream, besides PUBG, like once.
[1690.12s -> 1696.06s]  Okay, let's go for it.
[1696.06s -> 1697.02s]  Do you drop?
[1697.02s -> 1699.98s]  Do we fly in a giant taxi cab and have it drop us?
[1700.62s -> 1707.24s]  How do we land?
[1707.88s -> 1713.40s]  I don't understand.
[1713.96s -> 1721.45s]  Do we have to pick up items?
[1725.69s -> 1727.37s]  I'm so confused at how this is going to work.
[1732.38s -> 1734.70s]  Yes, a medieval plane drops you off.
[1740.55s -> 1742.07s]  Yeah, I mean, this is a long time ago.
[1742.07s -> 1743.99s]  It's probably one of those little sea planes.
[1743.99s -> 1751.14s]  That dragon?
[1751.14s -> 1751.86s]  Now that would be cool.
[1752.42s -> 1756.97s]  30 damage.
[1764.84s -> 1766.12s]  Oh, right in the face.
[1766.12s -> 1767.16s]  That did extra damage.
[1769.66s -> 1770.46s]  Got him.
[1770.46s -> 1771.66s]  See you later.
[1771.66s -> 1778.50s]  I feel like I'm going to like this Battle Royale because it's not...
[1779.06s -> 1783.19s]  You can't camp with, like, a sniper rifle on the roof.
[1783.83s -> 1794.04s]  You have to go beat the shit out of each other.
[1794.04s -> 1795.96s]  Oh, that would hurt so bad.
[1797.61s -> 1799.93s]  We're just punching a haymaker into stone.
[1800.57s -> 1804.17s]  What is going on?
[1804.73s -> 1807.75s]  They got DC?
[1807.75s -> 1809.27s]  Did I DC?
[1809.27s -> 1817.06s]  What the fuck?
[1817.06s -> 1818.10s]  This is going to be fun.
[1818.74s -> 1819.22s]  Come on.
[1820.15s -> 1821.43s]  Get me in there.
[1821.43s -> 1834.71s]  It's the server?
[1834.71s -> 1836.71s]  Should I join, like, a different server?
[1837.67s -> 1839.75s]  Should I join, like, US East or something?
[1839.75s -> 1842.30s]  Come on, get me in there.
[1844.28s -> 1845.80s]  I feel like I'd be very good at this.
[1846.44s -> 1852.50s]  You know what I'm saying?
[1854.90s -> 1855.86s]  I'll try this one more time.
[1862.74s -> 1865.54s]  I could burger boy technique at least half the people that play this game.
[1869.32s -> 1870.92s]  This used to be a variety stream.
[1870.92s -> 1873.48s]  Now you play Battle Royale like everybody else.
[1879.80s -> 1881.72s]  The matchmaking is all fucked up right now.
[1881.72s -> 1882.52s]  Okay, well, hold on.
[1887.99s -> 1889.35s]  The boomer technique?
[1889.35s -> 1893.10s]  Yeah, VR normie boomer streamer.
[1899.40s -> 1900.68s]  It's like, look, look.
[1903.21s -> 1905.13s]  The boomer technique is real.
[1906.33s -> 1909.37s]  You have to press the buttons as many of them as you can at the same time.
[1910.23s -> 1912.71s]  So you'll go to, you'll fight somebody in the arcade.
[1913.67s -> 1917.11s]  And you'll make them cry because you...
[1917.11s -> 1919.75s]  Well, I mean, like Mortal Kombat, like arcade cabinet.
[1919.75s -> 1923.75s]  What I used to do when I was a kid is they would be these dudes that were older.
[1923.75s -> 1925.91s]  They were like 10 years older than me, right?
[1926.78s -> 1930.14s]  And this is back when arcade machines had the good console games
[1930.14s -> 1932.14s]  because console games weren't good enough back then, right?
[1932.70s -> 1935.58s]  So Mortal Kombat 3 was in the arcade.
[1935.58s -> 1936.70s]  And what I would do is I would go there.
[1937.58s -> 1939.66s]  I was probably like 15 or no, I was like 12.
[1939.66s -> 1940.30s]  What am I talking about?
[1940.30s -> 1942.30s]  I was playing Mortal Kombat when I was like 12 in the arcade.
[1942.86s -> 1945.74s]  They didn't like, nobody cared if you did that.
[1945.74s -> 1950.06s]  So anyways, playing Mortal Kombat when I was 12 versus like a 19-year-old.
[1950.06s -> 1950.62s]  You know what I mean?
[1951.50s -> 1953.10s]  And you had the face buttons.
[1953.10s -> 1954.94s]  You had like six of them and you had the joystick.
[1955.82s -> 1959.18s]  And it was a thing back then where people would line up behind
[1960.34s -> 1961.86s]  whoever was playing and it would be like,
[1961.86s -> 1965.30s]  okay, when you lose, yeah, now it's my turn to try and take on the champion.
[1966.26s -> 1968.18s]  Because if you won, you didn't have to put my money in.
[1968.18s -> 1968.82s]  You got to stay.
[1969.38s -> 1974.52s]  So what would happen is I would get up there and go up again.
[1974.52s -> 1977.00s]  I would pick smoke every time in Mortal Kombat 3.
[1977.00s -> 1980.26s]  Cyborg Smoke was the best character ever.
[1980.26s -> 1981.94s]  And then this guy would crack his knuckles like,
[1981.94s -> 1983.86s]  yeah, this little kid's got nothing on me.
[1983.86s -> 1984.74s]  I've been practicing.
[1984.74s -> 1985.62s]  I got my own kit.
[1986.18s -> 1990.14s]  He'd get up and he would be doing his little button combos and shit.
[1990.14s -> 1991.34s]  And I would be going like this.
[1992.62s -> 1998.26s]  Just pressing every single button I could, mashing as hard as I could.
[1998.90s -> 1999.70s]  And I beat them all.
[2000.66s -> 2002.34s]  The guy would get fucking flawless half the time.
[2002.34s -> 2003.14s]  Am I supposed to be playing?
[2014.20s -> 2015.24s]  Next in line, please.
[2024.06s -> 2028.81s]  How does this work?
[2028.81s -> 2036.84s]  So there's 17 people left.
[2036.84s -> 2038.84s]  You want to fight the fucking 12-year-old?
[2045.35s -> 2047.59s]  That's a real fancy fucking kit you got there.
[2048.15s -> 2049.75s]  Too bad you didn't think you were going up against smoke.
[2059.75s -> 2061.35s]  He's trying to pick up items.
[2062.87s -> 2064.15s]  Oh shit, he's got, what does he got, a leg?
[2076.71s -> 2077.27s]  He doesn't even know.
[2083.51s -> 2084.39s]  Well, this guy's good.
[2087.08s -> 2088.20s]  Uh-oh, it's Kabal.
[2089.40s -> 2090.68s]  I'm standing in the fucking fire.
[2105.10s -> 2108.65s]  Why can I, why are we all so dumb?
[2108.65s -> 2111.78s]  Oh, I got to write the teeth.
[2118.02s -> 2121.53s]  Oh, you didn't think I was going to come at you like that, did you?
[2121.53s -> 2122.33s]  Oh, give me that.
[2122.33s -> 2123.05s]  What's that?
[2123.05s -> 2124.23s]  Give me his helmet, too.
[2124.97s -> 2125.45s]  Oh shit.
[2127.80s -> 2130.57s]  I'm going to get the presents.
[2130.57s -> 2130.97s]  Hold on.
[2130.97s -> 2131.53s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2131.53s -> 2132.65s]  There's a lot of stuff on the ground.
[2132.65s -> 2134.33s]  How do I go in my inventory?
[2134.33s -> 2137.46s]  I don't know how to go in my inventory.
[2138.02s -> 2139.62s]  Long sword, rusty shovel.
[2139.62s -> 2141.22s]  No, I don't want to use the rusty shovel.
[2144.34s -> 2144.90s]  Maybe I do.
[2145.46s -> 2149.37s]  What else do I have?
[2150.86s -> 2152.22s]  Okay, here's the poleaxe.
[2152.22s -> 2162.30s]  This is too nerve wracking.
[2162.30s -> 2167.90s]  How big is the area?
[2168.38s -> 2170.23s]  There's the guy right there.
[2170.23s -> 2171.75s]  I'm going to shovel the fuck out of this guy.
[2171.75s -> 2172.95s]  I just broke all my legs.
[2173.77s -> 2174.49s]  Is there a heal?
[2174.49s -> 2175.53s]  Am I healing over time?
[2175.53s -> 2176.17s]  I don't understand.
[2178.14s -> 2179.58s]  Oh my god, I'm going to shovel this guy.
[2180.14s -> 2190.07s]  What's that?
[2190.63s -> 2191.03s]  What's that?
[2200.33s -> 2200.81s]  Just kidding.
[2212.04s -> 2220.68s]  Oh, where's it going?
[2220.68s -> 2222.94s]  Someone's going to come from behind me.
[2222.94s -> 2227.26s]  I know it.
[2227.26s -> 2228.06s]  Eat berries?
[2228.06s -> 2228.70s]  Is that what you do?
[2235.00s -> 2251.40s]  Oh shit, I almost had it.
[2251.40s -> 2252.20s]  I don't know what to do.
[2254.68s -> 2256.04s]  How do I heal?
[2256.04s -> 2258.18s]  Give me the poleaxe.
[2258.18s -> 2258.82s]  What's this?
[2258.82s -> 2260.10s]  What the, what the, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2260.10s -> 2261.78s]  What, what, what, what, what?
[2261.78s -> 2262.42s]  What is that?
[2262.42s -> 2263.78s]  What did I die instantly for?
[2263.78s -> 2264.10s]  What?
[2265.30s -> 2266.42s]  Was that out of bounds?
[2268.34s -> 2268.66s]  What?
[2273.26s -> 2274.70s]  That's the circle?
[2274.70s -> 2276.22s]  Oh, there's a circle.
[2278.42s -> 2280.26s]  I thought it ticked damage on you.
[2283.69s -> 2285.53s]  Guys, I don't play Battle Royales.
[2285.53s -> 2287.69s]  I've played a Battle Royale like twice.
[2287.69s -> 2290.84s]  Oh, I can't believe he's not one of these streamers
[2290.84s -> 2292.68s]  that plays Battle Royale every day.
[2293.88s -> 2296.63s]  What?
[2296.63s -> 2299.27s]  I can't believe you didn't know that that was the circle.
[2299.27s -> 2302.71s]  I mean, this guy streams Battle Royales 5,000 hours.
[2302.71s -> 2303.99s]  I can't believe you didn't know.
[2304.79s -> 2305.43s]  I didn't know.
[2313.22s -> 2315.06s]  It was just gray.
[2315.06s -> 2317.14s]  I thought it was like going to battlefield me
[2317.14s -> 2318.10s]  and turn me around.
[2319.35s -> 2320.07s]  You know what it goes like?
[2321.27s -> 2323.27s]  Please get back to the playing field in five seconds.
[2334.71s -> 2335.67s]  Hey, it's Alex.
[2335.67s -> 2336.79s]  I did really well.
[2337.80s -> 2338.92s]  I was killing people.
[2338.92s -> 2340.60s]  I just fucking walked out of the circle
[2340.60s -> 2341.72s]  and died instantly.
[2341.72s -> 2343.93s]  I'm calling him.
[2343.93s -> 2344.98s]  He needs to know.
[2344.98s -> 2355.77s]  I'm calling him right now.
[2355.77s -> 2362.78s]  Hey, the Battle Royale circle thing instantly killed me.
[2362.78s -> 2363.82s]  I was doing well.
[2363.82s -> 2364.78s]  I was in the last six.
[2364.78s -> 2370.26s]  Did you get like chased and you got caught in the circle?
[2370.74s -> 2372.26s]  I cowered it out and I ran away.
[2372.26s -> 2374.18s]  But then like I stepped out of the circle for a second.
[2374.18s -> 2375.94s]  It was just like somebody hit me in the head with a rock
[2375.94s -> 2377.38s]  and I instantly died.
[2377.38s -> 2381.19s]  I don't play Battle Royales.
[2381.83s -> 2382.86s]  Hold on.
[2382.86s -> 2386.14s]  So you like you strolled casually into the fog?
[2386.14s -> 2386.70s]  Is that what happened?
[2387.58s -> 2388.94s]  And instantly died?
[2388.94s -> 2390.22s]  I was doing so good too.
[2390.22s -> 2390.62s]  All right.
[2390.62s -> 2391.34s]  How do I add you?
[2392.30s -> 2395.02s]  We're going to do that.
[2395.02s -> 2396.62s]  Can you queue as two for Battle Royale?
[2401.50s -> 2402.62s]  There's a party system.
[2402.62s -> 2403.42s]  Let's see.
[2403.42s -> 2404.79s]  Oops.
[2404.79s -> 2405.67s]  Party.
[2405.67s -> 2405.91s]  Home.
[2406.71s -> 2408.31s]  Am I logged in?
[2408.31s -> 2408.79s]  Probably not.
[2410.82s -> 2411.62s]  Maybe I can see you.
[2411.62s -> 2412.42s]  Are you like in the game?
[2413.06s -> 2413.54s]  Oh, there we go.
[2413.54s -> 2414.74s]  I think I can just add you.
[2417.48s -> 2418.04s]  What's your name?
[2420.25s -> 2420.81s]  Stixon.
[2421.37s -> 2422.25s]  Stixon.
[2422.89s -> 2423.43s]  All right.
[2423.43s -> 2424.23s]  There you go.
[2424.23s -> 2425.27s]  Did you get it?
[2425.27s -> 2428.38s]  You should have got it, right?
[2432.31s -> 2433.19s]  Yes.
[2433.19s -> 2438.17s]  But I don't see you in the party list here.
[2439.77s -> 2441.45s]  Yeah, it just it said I got an invite
[2441.45s -> 2443.93s]  but there's not actually like an accept invitation button.
[2445.83s -> 2447.27s]  Can you join off me?
[2447.27s -> 2450.65s]  It doesn't even say that you're playing Mordhau.
[2452.04s -> 2452.60s]  What?
[2452.60s -> 2452.92s]  What?
[2453.64s -> 2455.06s]  Can I join you?
[2461.16s -> 2462.76s]  When's this game coming out to the Epic Game Store?
[2462.76s -> 2463.72s]  Just wondering.
[2463.72s -> 2464.36s]  What?
[2464.36s -> 2464.60s]  What?
[2465.40s -> 2466.73s]  Oh, hold on.
[2466.73s -> 2467.93s]  Can I leave party now?
[2467.93s -> 2468.49s]  I don't think I can.
[2471.54s -> 2472.18s]  Yeah, I'm online.
[2472.18s -> 2473.38s]  I'm appearing online.
[2473.38s -> 2473.78s]  Should be.
[2479.21s -> 2480.89s]  Invites do not work.
[2480.89s -> 2481.13s]  Oh.
[2482.01s -> 2482.25s]  Well.
[2485.29s -> 2486.41s]  Invites don't work.
[2487.29s -> 2489.69s]  So like if I invite you, what does it say?
[2489.69s -> 2491.37s]  It says you invited me to play a hit play game
[2491.37s -> 2492.89s]  and I can't join you.
[2493.61s -> 2494.65s]  I just probably pressed it.
[2495.21s -> 2497.05s]  So, so we can't play together.
[2497.05s -> 2497.93s]  Is that what you guys are saying?
[2500.42s -> 2504.18s]  We have to find a server browser and join the same server.
[2504.18s -> 2506.50s]  Oh, that's that.
[2506.50s -> 2507.86s]  That's minus a full etiquette.
[2507.86s -> 2508.82s]  I think we're on the bad.
[2510.33s -> 2512.25s]  Okay, but that means that people can like come get us.
[2512.25s -> 2512.89s]  Isn't it?
[2512.89s -> 2515.45s]  Because they'll know what server we're in.
[2515.45s -> 2517.21s]  Isn't that like, isn't that the streamer thing?
[2517.21s -> 2520.49s]  We put on like a three minute delay and put a fake name on.
[2520.49s -> 2523.43s]  Hold on.
[2523.43s -> 2524.15s]  Server browser.
[2530.26s -> 2531.70s]  Rent a server is down here.
[2531.70s -> 2532.34s]  All right.
[2532.34s -> 2533.46s]  Server browser.
[2533.46s -> 2534.82s]  Are you getting anything in the server browser?
[2540.78s -> 2542.78s]  I'm not getting anything in the server browser.
[2545.53s -> 2546.97s]  The rent a server button works.
[2547.93s -> 2549.37s]  One availed by a server.
[2552.18s -> 2552.50s]  Okay.
[2552.50s -> 2559.91s]  How do we not full has players and no password?
[2559.91s -> 2561.27s]  They're official servers yet?
[2569.26s -> 2569.90s]  Game mode.
[2570.62s -> 2572.36s]  We should probably just do death match, right?
[2577.14s -> 2577.38s]  Yeah.
[2577.38s -> 2578.02s]  I hit refresh.
[2578.02s -> 2578.50s]  Let's see.
[2578.50s -> 2579.70s]  There you guys can see.
[2581.58s -> 2582.78s]  See, I'm kind of just sitting here.
[2582.78s -> 2583.42s]  Oh, there we go.
[2584.14s -> 2584.38s]  All right.
[2584.38s -> 2585.26s]  Real questions.
[2585.26s -> 2586.30s]  Is this game early access?
[2587.38s -> 2588.34s]  Uh, I don't, I don't know.
[2588.34s -> 2595.94s]  Is it, uh, there's his official death match.
[2595.94s -> 2598.34s]  Los Angeles with only one slot though.
[2602.89s -> 2606.26s]  Uh, all right.
[2606.26s -> 2608.26s]  So these, these mean that they're official servers.
[2610.55s -> 2610.79s]  All right.
[2610.79s -> 2611.43s]  I'm going to, okay.
[2611.43s -> 2613.19s]  I'm going to, I'm going to mute everything.
[2613.19s -> 2613.83s]  And I'm going to tell you the server.
[2613.83s -> 2615.51s]  Server browser works now.
[2615.51s -> 2617.19s]  Yeah, I can see it now.
[2617.19s -> 2618.87s]  Well, it don't, it don't even matter.
[2618.87s -> 2620.47s]  It doesn't matter what server people know we're going.
[2620.47s -> 2622.31s]  Cause there's only 16 people allowed anyways.
[2623.75s -> 2626.63s]  There's only like five that we're going to be able to choose from in the first place.
[2630.74s -> 2631.06s]  All right.
[2631.06s -> 2633.70s]  So we're going to whatever.
[2633.70s -> 2635.32s]  I don't matter.
[2635.32s -> 2637.32s]  We're going to sort by name.
[2637.32s -> 2638.52s]  We're going to.
[2638.52s -> 2638.84s]  Yeah.
[2639.64s -> 2644.02s]  So if I ping, I can't click any of the sort buttons.
[2644.02s -> 2644.26s]  No.
[2646.34s -> 2652.63s]  Uh, well let's just, well, it was fun playing with you.
[2653.35s -> 2654.87s]  That was really good coffee experience.
[2654.87s -> 2656.71s]  Glad you like asked me to play the Charlie.
[2656.71s -> 2657.27s]  Let's go.
[2658.41s -> 2661.05s]  Uh, there's, did you see this one?
[2661.85s -> 2665.13s]  Do you see the official U S West number eight?
[2665.13s -> 2666.25s]  I mean, there's nobody in there though.
[2667.99s -> 2668.87s]  There will be.
[2668.87s -> 2669.35s]  There's okay.
[2669.35s -> 2670.07s]  Official Dallas.
[2670.07s -> 2671.43s]  I'm going to find it before I can.
[2671.43s -> 2672.71s]  Do you see Dallas?
[2672.71s -> 2674.92s]  Official death match, Dallas.
[2680.71s -> 2682.31s]  There should be spots in there.
[2682.31s -> 2685.43s]  We don't have the greatest ping, but you know.
[2685.43s -> 2688.31s]  Well, what's the, what's the ping?
[2688.31s -> 2693.96s]  It's like a hundred.
[2693.96s -> 2696.92s]  Official team death match, Dallas or official death match.
[2697.64s -> 2702.97s]  Dallas is going to be full.
[2704.01s -> 2705.69s]  No, nobody's playing right now.
[2706.33s -> 2714.17s]  All right.
[2714.17s -> 2716.25s]  I'm going to give this like 30 more seconds
[2716.25s -> 2717.69s]  and then I'm just going to join a random server.
[2718.95s -> 2720.07s]  Yeah, that was, that was open.
[2722.28s -> 2723.64s]  Is it official death match?
[2723.64s -> 2724.20s]  Dallas.
[2724.20s -> 2729.10s]  Does Spina for it's like the high row can quick up.
[2730.73s -> 2731.77s]  I'm not going to be able to find it.
[2732.33s -> 2734.07s]  Uh, so all right.
[2734.07s -> 2735.03s]  There's no way to.
[2735.03s -> 2735.19s]  All right.
[2735.19s -> 2735.51s]  Wait, wait.
[2735.51s -> 2735.75s]  Okay.
[2735.75s -> 2737.83s]  We're, we're on the same internet.
[2737.83s -> 2738.95s]  So we have the same thing.
[2738.95s -> 2740.71s]  Tell me an exact ping for something.
[2740.71s -> 2741.59s]  And I joined.
[2741.59s -> 2751.88s]  Do you see the one with, uh, 65 ping Los Angeles.
[2751.88s -> 2752.52s]  Official death math.
[2752.52s -> 2753.80s]  Watch inches Phoebe five.

[2783.37s -> 2784.49s]  Yeah, I don't blame you.
[2784.49s -> 2787.53s]  It's not, uh, anyone's fault except the game
[2787.53s -> 2788.97s]  that the matchmaking doesn't work.
[2788.97s -> 2792.97s]  How do we not see the same one?
[2792.97s -> 2794.25s]  How do we not see the same one?
[2794.25s -> 2797.96s]  It's what's with this video game, the Lhasa.
[2797.96s -> 2802.38s]  Did you see Dallas Lhasa?
[2802.38s -> 2803.50s]  Go click it quick.
[2809.61s -> 2810.25s]  No, it's full.
[2813.61s -> 2814.89s]  It had like a few spots.
[2815.96s -> 2816.12s]  All right.
[2816.12s -> 2818.68s]  We'll just, um, I'm going to mute everything
[2818.68s -> 2819.72s]  and we're just going to talk.
[2819.72s -> 2820.04s]  Ready?
[2820.68s -> 2824.06s]  Oh, let me view you here.
[2824.06s -> 2824.54s]  All right.
[2824.54s -> 2915.99s]  Well, we're going to get this figured out.
[2915.99s -> 2916.31s]  All right.
[2916.31s -> 2916.63s]  I know.
[2916.63s -> 2919.99s]  Like, uh, I couldn't get like the surfer browser to come back.
[2919.99s -> 2928.34s]  So we're kind of just, we're just going to queue up the server browser.
[2928.34s -> 2929.30s]  Like wouldn't come back.
[2931.70s -> 2933.67s]  Let's try it again.
[2933.67s -> 2935.91s]  So Talix is no longer with us.
[2938.47s -> 2951.34s]  We will try again later because like this seems to work.
[2952.06s -> 2954.14s]  We can't see the same servers.
[2954.14s -> 2959.72s]  And when we try to join them, when I last tried to do that, it, I got errors.
[2959.72s -> 2960.44s]  It was like error.
[2960.44s -> 2961.32s]  Could not join.
[2961.32s -> 2962.68s]  And I was just trying to refresh the list.
[2962.68s -> 2963.88s]  I would sit there for like 20 seconds.
[2963.88s -> 2964.44s]  It wouldn't do anything.
[2965.24s -> 2969.53s]  Should have set this up before the stream.
[2969.53s -> 2970.09s]  I did.
[2970.73s -> 2971.37s]  I mean, I don't know.
[2971.37s -> 2973.13s]  The server is going to have problems right now.
[2973.13s -> 2973.77s]  Right this second.
[2973.77s -> 2974.65s]  How am I supposed to know that?
[2975.29s -> 2988.23s]  What's the date?
[2988.23s -> 2989.35s]  What's the default FOV?
[2989.35s -> 2995.51s]  Let's find out.
[2995.51s -> 2996.39s]  I have it at 90.
[2996.95s -> 2997.51s]  Should be more.
[3001.24s -> 3002.68s]  This is not going to count for points, right?
[3002.68s -> 3003.24s]  Should do a hundred.
[3003.88s -> 3005.74s]  A hundred might make me puke.
[3006.30s -> 3007.26s]  No, 95 is fine.
[3011.53s -> 3014.73s]  Yeah, this is too, this is, this is already, if I go more than this, I'll have a problem.
[3022.14s -> 3025.98s]  Yeah, when, when FOV is too high, it actually kind of sucks.
[3026.62s -> 3031.90s]  Because every time you turn, it's almost like you're looking through a telescope.
[3040.90s -> 3041.86s]  Sub 180.
[3041.86s -> 3048.58s]  How many players are here?
[3048.58s -> 3050.74s]  High ping and packet loss.
[3050.74s -> 3051.24s]  Uh-oh.
[3052.54s -> 3053.04s]  Uh-oh.
[3056.26s -> 3061.30s]  We may have hit the wall of playing a new game on the internet.
[3061.30s -> 3062.10s]  How new is this?
[3063.35s -> 3065.19s]  Didn't this come out like a week or two ago?
[3065.19s -> 3065.91s]  When did it come out?
[3068.81s -> 3069.61s]  Yesterday?
[3069.61s -> 3072.06s]  Oh, I forgot.
[3072.06s -> 3073.19s]  God damn it.
[3073.19s -> 3073.67s]  I forgot.
[3074.55s -> 3077.75s]  Any video game that releases for the first three days doesn't work.
[3077.75s -> 3078.79s]  I forgot.
[3078.79s -> 3079.51s]  God damn it.
[3080.23s -> 3105.03s]  My mistake is you got to wait for the first like week and a half to go by
[3105.03s -> 3106.55s]  from the, to patch the game three times.
[3107.45s -> 3108.81s]  And then you can play the game.
[3122.22s -> 3123.02s]  All right, I think we're starting.
[3123.58s -> 3133.91s]  You know what a game company should really do?
[3133.91s -> 3135.27s]  And maybe they do this, but who knows?
[3138.42s -> 3139.22s]  Do people do this?
[3139.78s -> 3140.82s]  Let me, let me ask you a question.
[3141.75s -> 3143.43s]  So if you had a video game that was releasing,
[3144.70s -> 3148.86s]  why wouldn't you just rent like an absolute shitload of servers?
[3148.86s -> 3151.98s]  Like too many, like a joke amount for like five days.
[3151.98s -> 3153.82s]  And then just turn them all off.
[3153.82s -> 3160.28s]  Just rent like an absolute dumb amount of servers for a month
[3160.28s -> 3161.00s]  and then just turn them off.
[3164.54s -> 3167.34s]  And then reduce it down to like the amount that you want.
[3167.34s -> 3175.58s]  All right, here we go.
[3177.34s -> 3178.38s]  That cost money though.
[3181.43s -> 3181.99s]  Yeah, I know.
[3181.99s -> 3185.59s]  Let's like, I'm not talking, this is not just like an independent studio thing.
[3185.59s -> 3189.91s]  This happens with like, does that, this happened with like Anthem too, didn't it?
[3190.47s -> 3192.92s]  I might be making that up.
[3192.92s -> 3195.00s]  Even AAA studios have the same problem.
[3195.00s -> 3198.98s]  All right, I'm gonna, this guy's fucking dead.
[3203.34s -> 3205.58s]  No, I'm just saying a triple, all right.
[3205.58s -> 3207.18s]  I'm gonna kill this guy with my bare hands.
[3207.18s -> 3208.62s]  No, I'm not, I'm gonna run away.
[3208.62s -> 3210.30s]  I'm gonna, I'm just gonna break my legs.
[3220.87s -> 3223.59s]  Shit, no, I don't have to, I don't have to read the queue now.
[3223.59s -> 3224.47s]  God damn it.
[3225.75s -> 3228.87s]  No, I was like, ah, I'm so fucking mad.
[3229.75s -> 3230.79s]  I just want to play.
[3231.67s -> 3252.78s]  All right, I'm gonna pick the other game mode then.
[3255.19s -> 3256.23s]  Use the server browser.
[3256.23s -> 3259.27s]  I just tried and I got errors trying to use the browser.
[3264.57s -> 3273.83s]  This is a pretty good menu stream so far.
[3287.27s -> 3288.31s]  Breathe Arnold.
[3289.59s -> 3296.20s]  So I guess just don't queue for BR.
[3296.20s -> 3322.68s]  My god, you gotta talk to Chad about Sam and Max.
[3322.68s -> 3327.54s]  Yeah, I'm gonna finish it, don't worry.
[3327.54s -> 3329.78s]  I, this is a fun game though.
[3329.78s -> 3330.50s]  Fuck.
[3330.50s -> 3349.08s]  Okay, come on, show me something.
[3349.08s -> 3351.08s]  God, okay, I don't even care what it is.
[3351.08s -> 3354.30s]  Just let me play, right?
[3354.30s -> 3355.58s]  Okay, don't give me an error.
[3355.58s -> 3357.02s]  They gave me an error last time.
[3357.02s -> 3358.89s]  Oh my god, it's not full.
[3366.36s -> 3367.80s]  Oh my, I can't believe it.
[3367.80s -> 3368.20s]  Let's go.
[3379.38s -> 3380.18s]  Huntsman.
[3380.18s -> 3389.46s]  Now don't die immediately.
[3390.02s -> 3395.91s]  I got a cleaver too.
[3395.91s -> 3398.07s]  This is actually, this is exactly what I'd want as a weapon
[3398.07s -> 3399.43s]  if I was in a medieval time.
[3399.43s -> 3405.56s]  All right, is the way they're coming in through here?
[3405.56s -> 3409.74s]  Is that a magician?
[3410.30s -> 3411.90s]  I, I hit that guy right in the head.
[3416.86s -> 3420.15s]  No, I can't, give me my cleaver.
[3420.15s -> 3430.89s]  So are we defending a point or is it just team death match?
[3430.89s -> 3434.18s]  Is it friendly fire?
[3435.62s -> 3436.34s]  Ooh, see ya.
[3441.62s -> 3441.94s]  Oops.
[3442.50s -> 3443.46s]  No, there's no friendly fire.
[3450.74s -> 3453.30s]  Oh wait, doesn't look like they can have archers on the other team.
[3458.50s -> 3459.22s]  I'm going up.
[3459.22s -> 3476.42s]  Help this guy out.
[3476.42s -> 3477.22s]  Oops.
[3477.22s -> 3479.72s]  Do they have any archers up?
[3479.72s -> 3482.44s]  Right there.
[3482.44s -> 3483.64s]  Oh, shit.
[3483.64s -> 3490.31s]  This guy's just wildly swinging.
[3490.31s -> 3495.69s]  I don't have any more, my bow is gone.
[3495.69s -> 3499.42s]  Did he knock the bow out of my hands?
[3504.02s -> 3506.98s]  Somebody said that guy is the headless ape swinging.
[3515.34s -> 3516.30s]  Oh shit.
[3516.30s -> 3527.62s]  I can do better than that.
[3527.62s -> 3530.42s]  Crazy man with cleaver charges into battle.
[3530.42s -> 3534.90s]  Guy's almost dead.
[3545.94s -> 3547.58s]  We're getting overrun.
[3552.34s -> 3554.10s]  I hit my teammate right in the head.
[3556.36s -> 3561.98s]  I'm going in.
[3561.98s -> 3562.62s]  No, get up here.
[3573.78s -> 3581.30s]  Oh, almost.
[3581.30s -> 3582.50s]  I helped that dude out.
[3582.50s -> 3584.42s]  Guy crossed the way here right there, right in the head.
[3584.42s -> 3585.45s]  Bang.
[3585.45s -> 3592.33s]  God damn it, he moved.
[3592.33s -> 3593.37s]  The archer's so much fun.
[3600.95s -> 3603.43s]  Okay, I'm going to try something else.
[3603.43s -> 3604.79s]  How about knight?
[3604.79s -> 3609.75s]  This is just standard battle.
[3618.78s -> 3620.62s]  Stream sniped.
[3620.62s -> 3622.38s]  See, I told you.
[3622.38s -> 3624.18s]  Why'd you hit me?
[3624.18s -> 3625.30s]  Are you stream sniping me?
[3626.10s -> 3629.62s]  That guy just stream sniped me and he's on my own team.
[3629.62s -> 3631.54s]  See, look, this guy's stream sniping.
[3631.54s -> 3634.07s]  I'm going to fucking kill the stream sniper, watch this.
[3634.71s -> 3635.43s]  Oh, look at you.
[3635.43s -> 3637.03s]  Oh, you got the stream open?
[3643.94s -> 3646.26s]  No, it's not a stream sniper.
[3646.26s -> 3660.92s]  Another stream sniper.
[3660.92s -> 3662.20s]  Welcome to VR.
[3662.20s -> 3667.08s]  Well, this isn't VR as it's just sticking around.
[3667.08s -> 3674.57s]  Here we go, one on one.
[3674.57s -> 3675.13s]  Don't hit me from...
[3679.78s -> 3686.98s]  Oh look, I'm not a stream sniper, huh?
[3689.02s -> 3691.42s]  You can't just run in there swinging and hitting walls, man.
[3693.66s -> 3694.46s]  Oh my god.
[3699.43s -> 3700.79s]  Shit, I got too many people there.
[3700.79s -> 3708.97s]  Dude, imagine that's how you die.
[3709.77s -> 3711.85s]  You'd probably still be alive for a second, right?
[3714.66s -> 3715.62s]  No, I don't think you would.
[3718.42s -> 3718.90s]  New class?
[3718.90s -> 3719.94s]  No, no, no, hold on.
[3719.94s -> 3721.30s]  Not yet, not quite.
[3721.94s -> 3727.35s]  Watch out.
[3736.76s -> 3739.34s]  Shit, where'd he go?
[3739.34s -> 3743.34s]  Is there a way to heal?
[3744.06s -> 3755.45s]  Oh fuck, he just ducked under it.
[3760.94s -> 3762.06s]  This is fucking fun.
[3764.81s -> 3766.97s]  You passively regen when you don't use stamina, okay.
[3767.53s -> 3772.86s]  This is like a combination of chivalry and for honor.
[3773.50s -> 3777.50s]  This is fucking fun.
[3777.50s -> 3778.94s]  This is actually a lot of fun.
[3779.58s -> 3780.86s]  I'm glad I get to play it.
[3781.50s -> 3785.34s]  I'm gonna do some more techniques here, man.
[3785.34s -> 3787.74s]  Like for instance, this stream sniper over here.
[3788.70s -> 3792.42s]  Which one of these stream snipers should I go after?
[3792.42s -> 3793.06s]  This guy right here.
[3793.70s -> 3805.91s]  It's not that long.
[3809.86s -> 3810.42s]  God damn it.
[3812.86s -> 3820.36s]  It's actually kind of hard to hit somebody in the back if they're running.
[3820.36s -> 3822.12s]  Because you have to take this time to swing.
[3823.48s -> 3825.32s]  That guy had a smaller weapon.
[3825.32s -> 3826.50s]  But where did I just go?
[3827.14s -> 3830.38s]  If he was doing it to me?
[3830.38s -> 3831.66s]  Yeah, because he had like a little knife.
[3832.30s -> 3833.58s]  All right, I'm gonna make up for it right now.
[3833.58s -> 3834.54s]  I'm taking this guy's head off.
[3845.08s -> 3849.05s]  Oh, that wasn't a parry.
[3849.05s -> 3854.92s]  Somebody's behind me too.
[3854.92s -> 3855.16s]  Fuck.
[3855.88s -> 3856.36s]  Not good.
[3860.73s -> 3862.49s]  All right, let's try a raider.
[3862.49s -> 3866.94s]  This guy's got a huge axe.
[3869.34s -> 3870.54s]  I'm not gonna run in this time.
[3871.10s -> 3871.98s]  I'm gonna stay back.
[3872.70s -> 3876.41s]  It's too fun just to try to go and take somebody's head off though.
[3877.05s -> 3881.59s]  That guy just threw an axe at me.
[3881.59s -> 3883.54s]  This guy's throwing weapons.
[3884.26s -> 3895.18s]  That guy's throwing maces and shit.
[3895.18s -> 3896.70s]  All right, I'll take care of this.
[3909.24s -> 3909.96s]  Nice.
[3909.96s -> 3910.76s]  Good job.
[3910.76s -> 3912.04s]  This guy ain't not paying attention.
[3912.04s -> 3912.92s]  Not paying attention.
[3912.92s -> 3913.88s]  Free head.
[3913.88s -> 3914.36s]  Free head.
[3917.00s -> 3917.72s]  Damn it.
[3917.72s -> 3918.60s]  Wasn't enough damage.
[3922.95s -> 3923.35s]  Fuck.
[3923.35s -> 3923.85s]  No.
[3924.63s -> 3929.69s]  I have throwing axes, do I?
[3931.86s -> 3932.66s]  Oh shit, I do.
[3932.66s -> 3933.16s]  Okay.
[3948.41s -> 3949.29s]  What just hit me?
[3950.55s -> 3950.79s]  What?
[3950.79s -> 3951.67s]  I just fall back.
[3952.31s -> 3956.52s]  I just fell down.
[3956.52s -> 3957.64s]  I just tripped.
[3957.64s -> 3958.52s]  Are you coming down here?
[3959.82s -> 3960.46s]  All right, fine.
[3960.46s -> 3961.34s]  I'll come up there to you.
[3963.45s -> 3964.65s]  You're gonna be dishonorable?
[3964.65s -> 3966.15s]  You're gonna let me up?
[3966.15s -> 3967.35s]  Fine, I'll put the axe away.
[3967.99s -> 3969.05s]  Let's go.
[3969.67s -> 3978.63s]  Is it?
[3978.63s -> 3979.29s]  Oh, no, no.
[3979.29s -> 3980.41s]  There's another guy.
[3980.41s -> 3987.40s]  Get him.
[3987.40s -> 3987.90s]  Get him.
[3988.44s -> 3989.24s]  Get him.
[3989.24s -> 3990.12s]  I'm distracting him.
[3990.12s -> 3990.62s]  Get him.
[4010.38s -> 4011.90s]  Hey, who did that?
[4012.87s -> 4013.91s]  I just got sniped.
[4013.91s -> 4016.47s]  Like there's an actual sniper rifle up there in the kill feed.
[4017.11s -> 4035.46s]  I love this.
[4035.46s -> 4035.94s]  This is so...
[4036.82s -> 4037.46s]  Oh man.
[4038.10s -> 4040.42s]  All right, first time ever getting to really play.
[4040.42s -> 4041.70s]  That was awesome.
[4050.92s -> 4052.36s]  Reminds me of Fistful of Frags.
[4052.36s -> 4052.84s]  It does.
[4055.98s -> 4057.10s]  It really does.
[4057.10s -> 4062.22s]  It's like Fistful of Frags.
[4062.94s -> 4065.34s]  For honor and chivalry.
[4065.98s -> 4069.42s]  It does have that Fistful of Frags feel.
[4069.42s -> 4069.90s]  You're right.
[4074.12s -> 4075.48s]  Uh, let's stay on the same team.
[4075.48s -> 4076.36s]  Why not?
[4076.36s -> 4078.49s]  What about protector?
[4079.21s -> 4080.49s]  So I'm like the shield.
[4081.05s -> 4082.73s]  I have to stay out in front of everybody, right?
[4083.29s -> 4083.93s]  Smoke bomb?
[4084.49s -> 4090.38s]  This is Dark Souls.
[4090.38s -> 4091.74s]  The Dark Souls guy, yeah.
[4094.95s -> 4095.35s]  Let's go.
[4097.59s -> 4099.27s]  I will be your shield.
[4100.92s -> 4101.72s]  And my bow.
[4102.86s -> 4104.30s]  And my axe.
[4104.30s -> 4107.24s]  Why is there not voice chat?
[4107.24s -> 4109.24s]  I want to have people scream memes in my face.
[4114.25s -> 4117.53s]  Um, speaking of people screaming memes in my face.
[4118.33s -> 4120.54s]  What is that sound?
[4122.52s -> 4124.20s]  Oops, no longer the shield.
[4129.72s -> 4130.12s]  Sorry.
[4137.43s -> 4139.83s]  Okay, this guy's just like Saitama.
[4139.83s -> 4140.71s]  Why is he winning?
[4142.98s -> 4144.58s]  It shouldn't be happening right now.
[4145.14s -> 4156.22s]  Damn it.
[4156.22s -> 4162.81s]  Got him.
[4162.81s -> 4163.85s]  All right, all right, all right.
[4163.85s -> 4164.73s]  Oh, all right.
[4164.73s -> 4165.21s]  Who is it?
[4168.79s -> 4169.27s]  Eat shit.
[4171.05s -> 4172.33s]  Um, did I just kill somebody?
[4172.33s -> 4174.09s]  I think I just killed somebody with the firework.
[4174.89s -> 4176.01s]  That was a bad idea.
[4176.73s -> 4179.35s]  Oh, no.
[4179.35s -> 4180.63s]  Was that a bad guy?
[4180.63s -> 4181.83s]  I couldn't tell in the smoke.
[4182.55s -> 4190.01s]  I just, I just Stephen, I just Stephen King to that guy.
[4190.73s -> 4193.45s]  They made a movie about what I just did.
[4194.01s -> 4207.70s]  Hitting somebody right in the face.
[4207.70s -> 4208.42s]  Let's do it again.
[4208.42s -> 4209.22s]  No, I don't have any more.
[4220.10s -> 4221.06s]  No way.
[4221.06s -> 4222.82s]  Somebody killed this fucking guy.
[4222.82s -> 4224.34s]  It's a frying pan.
[4228.23s -> 4229.83s]  Stop playing the guitar.
[4239.56s -> 4242.07s]  All right, that's the only death I've had the whole time.
[4242.07s -> 4242.47s]  Let's go.
[4244.90s -> 4246.10s]  Oh, it's you doing that.
[4249.14s -> 4250.26s]  I don't feel bad about that.
[4250.26s -> 4251.54s]  Am I going to get banned for what I'm doing?
[4252.50s -> 4254.02s]  Look, he's clearly being a nuisance.
[4254.02s -> 4254.52s]  Okay.
[4255.06s -> 4256.18s]  Clearly being a nuisance.
[4257.53s -> 4258.81s]  I don't get points taken down for that.
[4258.81s -> 4260.09s]  That guy was a nuisance.
[4260.09s -> 4270.86s]  Let me go in front.
[4270.86s -> 4271.66s]  Let me get in front.
[4277.22s -> 4277.94s]  Damn it.
[4277.94s -> 4295.13s]  I don't know.
[4295.13s -> 4295.63s]  Okay.
[4299.06s -> 4300.66s]  I look like such an idiot right now.
[4313.88s -> 4314.38s]  Come here.
[4315.24s -> 4315.74s]  Damn it.
[4316.20s -> 4320.54s]  All right, I'm going to change class.
[4321.54s -> 4324.28s]  Uh, what is, uh, Brigand?
[4324.28s -> 4325.08s]  Uh, Footman?
[4325.88s -> 4326.52s]  Scoundrel?
[4327.48s -> 4328.12s]  Engineer?
[4328.68s -> 4330.71s]  I'm going with veteran.
[4330.71s -> 4342.15s]  He's taunting?
[4343.74s -> 4344.46s]  All right.
[4344.46s -> 4347.02s]  Yeah, I was gonna say that's not a good idea for you to taunt right there.
[4347.74s -> 4353.06s]  See ya.
[4353.06s -> 4356.01s]  I'm going for an overhead smash right in this guy's head.
[4371.64s -> 4372.12s]  Damn it.
[4372.12s -> 4372.60s]  Too many.
[4372.60s -> 4373.00s]  Too many.
[4373.00s -> 4373.40s]  Too many.
[4373.40s -> 4373.88s]  Too many.
[4373.88s -> 4374.38s]  Too many.
[4375.08s -> 4376.14s]  Too many.
[4376.14s -> 4376.62s]  Too many.
[4376.62s -> 4377.34s]  Too many.
[4377.34s -> 4383.43s]  Oh, here we go.
[4383.43s -> 4383.91s]  What does he get?
[4383.91s -> 4385.75s]  So he's got Evening Star.
[4386.47s -> 4388.17s]  This thing is huge.
[4398.68s -> 4399.56s]  Wow, that does a lot.
[4410.89s -> 4411.93s]  It's brutal.
[4411.93s -> 4414.74s]  Oops, sorry.
[4421.37s -> 4434.04s]  Oh, shit.
[4434.04s -> 4434.54s]  Fuck.
[4435.22s -> 4437.54s]  Oh, he fucking just baited me so hard.
[4437.54s -> 4442.30s]  I thought he turned around and ran.
[4442.30s -> 4444.62s]  I thought he was, I looked like he was turning around to run.
[4444.62s -> 4457.74s]  Look at the big chunk missing.
[4457.74s -> 4461.85s]  Watch out.
[4461.85s -> 4462.41s]  Naked guy.
[4463.67s -> 4466.31s]  Naked guy with the pan.
[4466.31s -> 4467.51s]  Oh, this is bad.
[4467.51s -> 4471.21s]  This is really bad.
[4471.21s -> 4478.17s]  Oh, fuck.
[4478.17s -> 4478.81s]  Nope.
[4478.81s -> 4489.70s]  Dude, I always have to get like, it's always like a 4v4v.
[4489.70s -> 4490.50s]  Aw, team stack.
[4490.50s -> 4491.62s]  Scramble the teams.
[4491.62s -> 4497.38s]  Scramble the teams.
[4497.38s -> 4498.42s]  Yo, you idiot.
[4501.26s -> 4519.93s]  Get up.
[4519.93s -> 4520.57s]  Oh, God.
[4522.33s -> 4523.77s]  I'm team killing.
[4523.77s -> 4524.41s]  So is he.
[4525.29s -> 4538.78s]  He's arguably killing more teammates than I am.
[4538.78s -> 4539.58s]  What do you mean no?
[4539.58s -> 4543.50s]  He's like standing in the way and, oh, my fucking God.
[4544.06s -> 4554.41s]  I'm gonna go to, let's go Huntsman again.
[4554.41s -> 4575.90s]  Damn it.
[4575.90s -> 4580.81s]  You're not gonna T-back me in my own stream?
[4589.99s -> 4590.71s]  Fuck, he did.
[4600.90s -> 4602.26s]  The loot gives health.
[4602.26s -> 4605.38s]  Oh, I thought he was just like doing a taunt like command.
[4605.38s -> 4625.43s]  A little chip damage, not a big deal.
[4625.43s -> 4626.71s]  Uh-oh, here they all come again.
[4629.37s -> 4630.01s]  Watch out.
[4630.01s -> 4630.57s]  Watch out.
[4630.57s -> 4631.13s]  Watch out.
[4631.77s -> 4632.81s]  Pick up your sword.
[4633.37s -> 4652.36s]  Okay, good.
[4652.36s -> 4653.64s]  Oh, I didn't get him in the head.
[4663.48s -> 4679.54s]  Get out of here.
[4679.54s -> 4680.26s]  I get it.
[4680.26s -> 4681.46s]  Right here, right in the head.
[4681.46s -> 4682.44s]  Damn it.
[4682.44s -> 4682.84s]  Almost.
[4682.84s -> 4683.24s]  Oh, boy.
[4683.24s -> 4683.56s]  Oh, boy.
[4683.56s -> 4684.36s]  Gotta make the shots count.
[4684.36s -> 4685.48s]  The shots gotta count.
[4685.48s -> 4685.96s]  Didn't count.
[4691.62s -> 4691.86s]  Get.
[4705.59s -> 4706.71s]  What is he doing?
[4706.71s -> 4713.85s]  Oh, he's just stream sniping.
[4713.85s -> 4714.97s]  That's what he's doing.
[4714.97s -> 4716.86s]  Did he block that?
[4720.31s -> 4721.59s]  He's blocking the arrows.
[4736.79s -> 4737.35s]  Damn it.
[4737.35s -> 4742.60s]  Did it not hit him?
[4742.60s -> 4743.88s]  Sounded like it hit him.
[4743.88s -> 4751.88s]  Damn it.
[4751.88s -> 4753.00s]  I thought the guy was still next to me.
[4756.76s -> 4760.18s]  Oh, I wanna go, I don't know.
[4760.18s -> 4764.84s]  I haven't done this yet.
[4764.84s -> 4769.42s]  You definitely wanna do a lot of stabs with this.
[4778.28s -> 4779.08s]  Don't get baited out.
[4779.08s -> 4780.12s]  They're trying to bait us.
[4780.12s -> 4793.53s]  All right, this guy too.
[4793.53s -> 4795.53s]  Oh, that's a lot of reach.
[4795.53s -> 4797.56s]  This thing is nice.
[4797.56s -> 4800.68s]  Shit.
[4800.68s -> 4801.48s]  Watch out for this guy.
[4810.98s -> 4812.34s]  Oh, come on.
[4812.34s -> 4823.37s]  Spears are the best weapons.
[4823.37s -> 4824.25s]  Oh, medic bag.
[4824.65s -> 4825.61s]  Do I have to touch people with this
[4825.61s -> 4826.89s]  or do they just get healed if I near them?
[4827.45s -> 4830.74s]  How'd you get to the side?
[4837.70s -> 4838.58s]  Just drop it over here.
[4839.22s -> 4842.17s]  I only get one.
[4842.17s -> 4843.53s]  All right, so it's just behind here.
[4845.05s -> 4846.57s]  Well, I thought they were gonna be fighting here.
[4851.62s -> 4852.66s]  This way, doctor.
[4853.93s -> 4854.33s]  Kind of.
[4861.03s -> 4863.43s]  You can buy weapons and customize a character.
[4863.43s -> 4863.83s]  Really?
[4864.55s -> 4866.49s]  That's actually really awesome.
[4870.38s -> 4870.70s]  Nice.
[4870.70s -> 4872.14s]  That was a good backswing.
[4878.57s -> 4886.71s]  Good job.
[4899.05s -> 4900.73s]  Why is the guy with the pants so good?
[4903.96s -> 4904.44s]  Oh, fuck.
[4904.44s -> 4905.16s]  There's somebody here.
[4905.72s -> 4916.22s]  So it's currently bugged right now?
[4916.22s -> 4916.70s]  That's okay.
[4916.70s -> 4917.02s]  I see.
[4924.41s -> 4925.21s]  Parry.
[4925.21s -> 4929.86s]  Oh, damn it.
[4929.86s -> 4930.02s]  What?
[4930.58s -> 4930.82s]  What?
[4931.38s -> 4933.03s]  How did I not?
[4935.38s -> 4936.26s]  I don't like it.
[4936.26s -> 4938.79s]  Who have I not?
[4938.79s -> 4940.31s]  What item have I not used?
[4940.95s -> 4954.49s]  Try this.
[4954.49s -> 4955.53s]  Oh, a zweander.
[4959.34s -> 4959.66s]  What?
[4959.66s -> 4969.50s]  All right, watch out.
[4969.50s -> 4972.52s]  What do I have for a...
[4972.52s -> 4973.88s]  Oh, I have this too.
[4973.88s -> 4974.44s]  I have a shortser.
[4974.44s -> 4974.84s]  That's good.
[4976.31s -> 4977.27s]  That'll come in handy.
[4987.10s -> 4988.94s]  The Nintendo's zweander?
[4999.59s -> 5000.55s]  I'm gonna die in one hit.
[5001.42s -> 5002.94s]  It was one of those medical sandbags.
[5002.94s -> 5003.82s]  I need one.
[5003.82s -> 5008.18s]  There we go.
[5008.18s -> 5008.74s]  Oh, we win.
[5022.92s -> 5024.60s]  64-person server.
[5024.60s -> 5029.10s]  Should I try to get the 60?
[5029.10s -> 5032.31s]  That'll be absolute chaos.
[5032.31s -> 5033.43s]  All right, I'll go for it.
[5033.43s -> 5035.93s]  What do I...
[5036.49s -> 5048.09s]  Server browser.
[5048.09s -> 5049.69s]  All right, that's not quit game.
[5049.69s -> 5050.01s]  That's a...
[5054.09s -> 5054.73s]  That's not quit...
[5054.73s -> 5055.85s]  That's quit game.
[5055.85s -> 5057.13s]  Does that take me to the menu?
[5057.13s -> 5058.09s]  Or does that quit out?
[5058.65s -> 5059.05s]  Okay.
[5059.05s -> 5061.29s]  Some of these games just boot you out to the...
[5061.29s -> 5062.33s]  They take you out of the whole game.
[5065.91s -> 5076.12s]  I'll try like a huge one.
[5076.12s -> 5077.72s]  You're gonna regret that, probably.
[5077.72s -> 5078.60s]  But it's all good.
[5084.73s -> 5085.61s]  Customized gear.
[5085.61s -> 5086.41s]  I don't think I can, right?
[5086.41s -> 5087.45s]  It's a bit messed up.
[5089.06s -> 5089.78s]  Isn't it broken?
[5093.03s -> 5094.07s]  I don't have any money.
[5094.07s -> 5095.27s]  I'm not even getting currency.
[5103.53s -> 5104.73s]  New mercenary.
[5104.73s -> 5109.50s]  Zweander.
[5111.30s -> 5111.62s]  Head.
[5112.34s -> 5115.74s]  I'm gonna...
[5115.74s -> 5116.78s]  I'll put peasant hair on.
[5116.78s -> 5117.42s]  That sounds good.
[5120.28s -> 5120.84s]  Torso.
[5123.08s -> 5124.12s]  No, that's too easy.
[5124.12s -> 5124.68s]  This one.
[5124.68s -> 5125.24s]  Peasant, sure.
[5125.24s -> 5126.20s]  I'm just gonna be a peasant.
[5131.85s -> 5132.09s]  I'm just...
[5132.09s -> 5133.13s]  I'll be really unassuming.
[5133.69s -> 5136.62s]  Okay.
[5136.62s -> 5137.02s]  Legs.
[5137.02s -> 5137.50s]  Workers.
[5137.50s -> 5138.38s]  Shorts.
[5138.38s -> 5138.78s]  Pants.
[5139.34s -> 5141.93s]  That's fine.
[5142.98s -> 5143.38s]  All right.
[5143.38s -> 5143.78s]  Gear.
[5143.78s -> 5144.26s]  Equipment.
[5147.61s -> 5148.25s]  Oh.
[5148.25s -> 5149.05s]  Cost of point.
[5150.39s -> 5150.95s]  Yeah, I don't...
[5150.95s -> 5151.83s]  I can't do any of this.
[5154.15s -> 5155.67s]  I'm not getting any currency.
[5156.39s -> 5161.56s]  Yeah, customization does not work right now.
[5161.56s -> 5161.80s]  Okay.
[5161.80s -> 5162.36s]  Well, that's all right.
[5166.84s -> 5167.48s]  That's all good.
[5168.74s -> 5169.62s]  I had 15?
[5170.66s -> 5172.18s]  I thought that I couldn't do it.
[5172.90s -> 5173.86s]  Everyone just said it was down.
[5190.54s -> 5192.22s]  For instance, okay, like dagger, right?
[5195.02s -> 5196.86s]  Yeah, progression doesn't work.
[5202.18s -> 5203.14s]  Oh, god damn it.
[5203.62s -> 5207.58s]  Did I just spend those or can I...
[5208.22s -> 5209.66s]  Okay, wait, okay, okay, okay.
[5209.66s -> 5214.52s]  Peasant.
[5214.52s -> 5215.00s]  Okay.
[5215.00s -> 5216.52s]  Why would that be a perk?
[5216.52s -> 5217.94s]  What does that do?
[5217.94s -> 5221.94s]  Crouch movement speed.
[5221.94s -> 5227.64s]  Cat.
[5227.64s -> 5228.20s]  Friendly.
[5229.45s -> 5230.17s]  I like that one.
[5232.58s -> 5233.06s]  Ranger.
[5235.16s -> 5235.96s]  Scavenger.
[5239.13s -> 5239.61s]  Dodge.
[5240.66s -> 5241.94s]  That's actually really good.
[5241.94s -> 5242.50s]  Brawler.
[5242.50s -> 5242.98s]  Might as well just...
[5248.17s -> 5249.29s]  Wreck structures, repair.
[5251.21s -> 5254.17s]  And bows, crossbows, and throwables deal more damage
[5254.17s -> 5256.70s]  against enemies carrying the quiver.
[5256.70s -> 5258.22s]  Stimina on kill increased by...
[5258.22s -> 5259.18s]  That's good.
[5259.18s -> 5262.44s]  And we'll do fists.
[5262.44s -> 5262.92s]  Why not?
[5263.98s -> 5266.22s]  Peasant does not do anything.
[5266.22s -> 5267.90s]  Well, why would it be eight points?
[5272.50s -> 5274.42s]  Gain full health on a melee kill.
[5274.42s -> 5275.94s]  Yeah, why would I not just select this?
[5277.05s -> 5279.69s]  And then, like, fury.
[5280.84s -> 5285.35s]  And instantly start sprinting upon killing an enemy.
[5288.06s -> 5290.06s]  Gain three extra stamina on hit.
[5290.06s -> 5290.54s]  That's good.
[5291.18s -> 5293.56s]  Friendly fire reduction.
[5294.20s -> 5297.56s]  Fine, I'll do rat.
[5298.20s -> 5299.75s]  It's because I have to.
[5301.42s -> 5303.42s]  And then, fatal melee and projectile damage
[5303.42s -> 5305.90s]  except a headshot does not kill you immediately.
[5306.82s -> 5307.78s]  Sure, why not?
[5307.78s -> 5309.72s]  And then, that's it.
[5310.58s -> 5313.27s]  Okay, so that's it.
[5313.91s -> 5315.19s]  But he doesn't have any items.
[5315.83s -> 5318.23s]  What does he have?
[5318.23s -> 5318.95s]  He doesn't have anything.
[5320.26s -> 5321.70s]  He has no equipment.
[5321.70s -> 5324.18s]  I can't unlock this.
[5325.59s -> 5326.71s]  None of these can be used.
[5327.35s -> 5329.29s]  He's just gonna be fists.
[5330.70s -> 5331.50s]  Well, then I have to...
[5332.14s -> 5333.66s]  Well, then I have to take that off and go like that.
[5337.59s -> 5338.71s]  All right, that's fine.
[5338.71s -> 5340.65s]  I'm ready to go.
[5340.65s -> 5345.21s]  So we're looking for a high.
[5345.21s -> 5347.93s]  I get 64, 48.
[5348.97s -> 5352.06s]  Okay, let's do 48 first.
[5352.86s -> 5353.58s]  You know what I'm saying?
[5353.58s -> 5354.94s]  You know, I'm not gonna do 64.
[5355.66s -> 5356.30s]  Right off the bat.
[5356.86s -> 5366.90s]  All right, this one.
[5371.19s -> 5372.39s]  There's a lot of people here.
[5373.11s -> 5376.20s]  I have to choose my spawn point.
[5377.75s -> 5378.47s]  Oh dear.
[5379.83s -> 5381.19s]  Capture the enemy flags.
[5381.91s -> 5394.74s]  What?
[5396.66s -> 5399.46s]  That probably looked so funny on their screen.
[5411.46s -> 5413.38s]  That's why he's called this way, Ender.
[5413.38s -> 5416.06s]  For this exact purpose.
[5416.62s -> 5426.38s]  What does he got?
[5426.38s -> 5427.02s]  No, I'll keep this.
[5430.46s -> 5431.66s]  Whoa, fire bomb.
[5434.92s -> 5435.72s]  Fuck, what was I thinking?
[5436.28s -> 5437.00s]  Get this health over there.
[5444.86s -> 5445.74s]  No!
[5445.74s -> 5446.54s]  From where?
[5446.54s -> 5447.10s]  From behind?
[5460.98s -> 5463.54s]  I'm gonna do a couple more times with this useless character.
[5464.10s -> 5466.04s]  And I'm gonna go from there.
[5466.04s -> 5466.68s]  Get a horse.
[5469.45s -> 5471.05s]  Enemy is capturing the rafters.
[5471.85s -> 5472.74s]  Well, stop them.
[5473.38s -> 5482.79s]  This guy's just laying out everybody.
[5482.79s -> 5488.54s]  Give me that thing.
[5488.54s -> 5493.64s]  I'm gonna use my rat skills by crouching.
[5494.28s -> 5496.47s]  I got 20% more crouch power.
[5498.06s -> 5498.94s]  Jesus Christ.
[5503.53s -> 5503.85s]  What?
[5504.79s -> 5505.67s]  By what?
[5505.67s -> 5507.70s]  Did I get my head cut off?
[5508.26s -> 5510.23s]  All right, I wanna do...
[5510.23s -> 5512.31s]  Let's go with like an actual character here.
[5512.87s -> 5526.62s]  All right, we took the rafters back.
[5527.50s -> 5527.82s]  Good.
[5528.54s -> 5530.07s]  Try engineer?
[5530.07s -> 5530.71s]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[5530.71s -> 5531.51s]  Okay.
[5531.51s -> 5532.15s]  I will.
[5532.15s -> 5536.02s]  All right, let's stay together.
[5538.36s -> 5538.92s]  What's that thing?
[5540.58s -> 5542.02s]  Stay together or die alone?
[5543.72s -> 5545.24s]  Some video game had that for a tagline.
[5545.24s -> 5546.36s]  It was a great tagline.
[5547.00s -> 5555.91s]  Was it Vermintide?
[5555.91s -> 5556.23s]  Was it?
[5562.94s -> 5564.14s]  Oh, that guy's on their team.
[5579.26s -> 5579.50s]  What?
[5579.50s -> 5580.62s]  He took my arm off.
[5580.62s -> 5582.06s]  Oh god damn it.
[5582.06s -> 5582.38s]  What?
[5583.74s -> 5585.58s]  I'm covered in plate armor.
[5585.58s -> 5586.78s]  He took my arm off?
[5588.82s -> 5589.14s]  What?
[5594.22s -> 5595.18s]  Holy shit.
[5600.60s -> 5602.04s]  Oh, that's my perk.
[5602.04s -> 5602.36s]  Okay.
[5603.08s -> 5604.38s]  I get it.
[5604.38s -> 5605.26s]  That's funny.
[5605.26s -> 5612.62s]  He's trying to run away.
[5617.64s -> 5618.68s]  I love this shit, man.
[5618.68s -> 5620.36s]  People just whacking at the walls.
[5621.00s -> 5624.46s]  What is this guy doing?
[5624.46s -> 5635.30s]  All right, only a couple more.
[5641.10s -> 5641.90s]  Don't let up.
[5641.90s -> 5642.54s]  How do we lose?
[5642.54s -> 5643.50s]  We're standing here.
[5643.50s -> 5645.66s]  Surprise me.
[5646.22s -> 5646.94s]  Okay.
[5646.94s -> 5651.83s]  What if we weren't standing in the capture point?
[5652.39s -> 5657.90s]  Oh, reinforcement's okay.
[5657.90s -> 5663.85s]  I'm never gonna rank up.
[5664.41s -> 5665.53s]  I'll always be level one.
[5666.09s -> 5668.06s]  Let's go here.
[5668.06s -> 5678.22s]  I wonder if I get better.
[5678.22s -> 5679.90s]  I gotta like practice and get better.
[5685.69s -> 5687.85s]  I want to do the other game modes too.
[5688.49s -> 5690.01s]  All right.
[5690.01s -> 5691.85s]  I've played with everybody except the engineer.
[5691.85s -> 5692.97s]  So what does the engineer do?
[5693.69s -> 5702.57s]  Toolbox, loot, blacksmith, hammer.
[5703.21s -> 5707.24s]  So I can do this now.
[5712.02s -> 5712.26s]  Loot.
[5712.82s -> 5714.70s]  The hammer fixes the walls.
[5715.74s -> 5716.78s]  What does this do?
[5718.34s -> 5720.58s]  I put down walls for people to hide behind?
[5725.42s -> 5725.82s]  I guess.
[5729.16s -> 5730.76s]  Oh, I can put down spikes too.
[5731.48s -> 5731.72s]  All right.
[5731.72s -> 5732.20s]  Well, here we go.
[5732.84s -> 5735.93s]  Put the spikes down right here.
[5739.05s -> 5741.56s]  Um, I really don't.
[5741.56s -> 5742.04s]  I don't know.
[5742.92s -> 5758.63s]  Come on.
[5758.63s -> 5759.27s]  Hurry up.
[5759.27s -> 5765.70s]  All right.
[5765.70s -> 5767.78s]  See, we got like a strategic location here now.
[5781.96s -> 5782.36s]  Come here.
[5782.36s -> 5783.32s]  Come here with that horse.
[5789.88s -> 5795.88s]  Oh, I could have had a chance there with the hammer.
[5795.88s -> 5796.92s]  Get back here.
[5796.92s -> 5810.94s]  This is healing people, right?
[5815.96s -> 5817.16s]  Oh, look at this.
[5817.16s -> 5818.52s]  The internet is having problems.
[5824.31s -> 5826.15s]  Oh, I thought I could really take him off.
[5826.15s -> 5827.53s]  I'm gonna get him right here.
[5827.53s -> 5828.33s]  He doesn't even know I'm right.
[5828.33s -> 5830.10s]  He doesn't know I'm chasing after him.
[5830.10s -> 5831.38s]  I mean, it doesn't really matter.
[5831.38s -> 5831.70s]  It doesn't matter.
[5831.70s -> 5834.58s]  I'll get him right here.
[5834.58s -> 5836.62s]  Oh, what does this do?
[5843.06s -> 5843.94s]  Repairing?
[5844.18s -> 5845.70s]  I don't even know what I repaired.
[5845.70s -> 5850.87s]  What is the loot?
[5850.87s -> 5851.59s]  The mandolin?
[5851.59s -> 5856.57s]  It's, uh, I don't know.
[5856.57s -> 5857.21s]  I think it heals.
[5860.66s -> 5861.78s]  Build a stables.
[5861.78s -> 5862.66s]  Do I have to do that?
[5863.22s -> 5872.86s]  Oh, fuck.
[5872.86s -> 5880.81s]  Hold on.
[5880.81s -> 5882.01s]  This is a bad guy, right?
[5882.01s -> 5882.65s]  It is an enemy.
[5886.26s -> 5887.78s]  Kill him with the horse.
[5887.78s -> 5888.28s]  Get him.
[5889.22s -> 5890.18s]  Kill him.
[5890.18s -> 5890.98s]  He's can't.
[5890.98s -> 5892.10s]  You can't let him get away.
[5904.52s -> 5905.32s]  God damn it.
[5905.32s -> 5906.52s]  I'm not even paying attention.
[5911.59s -> 5912.71s]  I hit him off the horse.
[5912.71s -> 5913.75s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[5914.55s -> 5915.99s]  I don't want to be this guy anymore.
[5915.99s -> 5918.63s]  I feel like I don't know enough about the game to be useful.
[5919.27s -> 5923.02s]  We'll go back to Raider with the...
[5925.56s -> 5927.08s]  Look, I'm going to help a little bit here.
[5929.69s -> 5930.33s]  The horn!
[5931.13s -> 5932.41s]  The horn has been blown!
[5933.21s -> 5939.91s]  Whatever.
[5939.91s -> 5940.39s]  Just give me...
[5940.39s -> 5941.43s]  I want to be the Raider.
[5947.56s -> 5948.92s]  He's helping.
[5948.92s -> 5949.56s]  Not really.
[5950.58s -> 5951.30s]  Now I'm going to help.
[5951.30s -> 5951.78s]  Watch this.
[5952.50s -> 5954.26s]  If I don't get at least three kills here
[5954.98s -> 5959.78s]  and clean not assists me get the kill,
[5959.78s -> 5962.42s]  then bye bye Twitch channel.
[5962.42s -> 5975.42s]  That was mine.
[5975.42s -> 5981.42s]  And wait for it.
[5981.42s -> 5981.82s]  Wait for him.
[5981.82s -> 5982.70s]  Wait for him.
[5982.70s -> 5983.66s]  I'll get him on the run and back.
[5983.66s -> 5984.54s]  I'll get him on the run around here.
[5984.54s -> 5985.74s]  He's going to come around here.
[5985.74s -> 5986.46s]  Watch this shit.
[5987.18s -> 5988.79s]  Here he comes around the corner.
[5988.79s -> 5989.75s]  He's going to wrap around.
[5989.75s -> 5992.63s]  Three, two, one.
[5992.63s -> 5993.27s]  No, never mind.
[5993.91s -> 6023.19s]  Oh, by the way, if the game lags out, it doesn't count.
[6023.19s -> 6043.93s]  One, two, three.
[6043.93s -> 6048.76s]  Oops, three.
[6048.76s -> 6052.17s]  That's mine.
[6052.17s -> 6053.21s]  He had the last stand thing.
[6053.21s -> 6053.61s]  I killed him.
[6054.49s -> 6064.34s]  This is mine.
[6064.34s -> 6065.14s]  Mine.
[6065.14s -> 6069.05s]  How is this guy still alive?
[6074.55s -> 6076.31s]  I told you to leave me alone.
[6078.22s -> 6078.62s]  Okay.
[6079.34s -> 6080.94s]  Does that negate the other one?
[6080.94s -> 6082.62s]  I think that negates it.
[6082.62s -> 6083.58s]  Oh shit.
[6087.43s -> 6089.67s]  Okay, run, run, run, run, run.
[6090.90s -> 6092.26s]  That doesn't negate it.
[6092.26s -> 6092.98s]  It doesn't negate it.
[6092.98s -> 6093.38s]  I win.
[6094.28s -> 6095.16s]  I got more than three.
[6095.16s -> 6095.80s]  I got four.
[6098.92s -> 6100.20s]  Oh my god.
[6100.20s -> 6102.36s]  This game is fucking bonkers.
[6105.24s -> 6106.60s]  That's four with a team kill.
[6106.60s -> 6109.16s]  So it was minus one, which means it's three.
[6112.50s -> 6114.58s]  He seriously just walked into it though.
[6115.54s -> 6117.62s]  How many people do you think back in medieval times
[6118.18s -> 6120.66s]  like fucking killed each other accidentally?
[6123.10s -> 6123.66s]  Think about this.
[6123.66s -> 6125.34s]  If there was a giant battle like this shit,
[6128.70s -> 6131.42s]  you're going to swing in a circle and you're going to hit five people.
[6135.58s -> 6137.18s]  Don't ever charge in with anybody.
[6139.30s -> 6140.50s]  Archer was where it was at.
[6141.93s -> 6145.21s]  You couldn't accidentally take off a friend's head with an axe.
[6145.21s -> 6150.81s]  Oh, that was pretty clean.
[6150.81s -> 6151.69s]  That one hit right there.
[6152.25s -> 6159.94s]  Oh shit.
[6167.11s -> 6169.72s]  Come on.
[6169.72s -> 6170.76s]  Oh, what's that?
[6170.76s -> 6171.40s]  How did that feel?
[6172.04s -> 6173.16s]  How did that one feel?
[6173.16s -> 6173.88s]  Dude, there goes your head.
[6173.88s -> 6174.12s]  All right.
[6174.12s -> 6175.40s]  I'm starting to get the hang of this shit.
[6176.04s -> 6186.06s]  Oh, that was a little delay.
[6186.78s -> 6193.19s]  This is pretty high.
[6193.19s -> 6193.43s]  All right.
[6193.43s -> 6194.79s]  Let's just let's get let's get back here.
[6195.51s -> 6199.80s]  That wouldn't be the guy's shield.
[6201.93s -> 6202.33s]  Oops.
[6215.05s -> 6217.21s]  Oh, this thrusting swords.
[6217.21s -> 6228.07s]  Is that me screaming?
[6228.07s -> 6228.87s]  What's the emotes?
[6229.51s -> 6234.90s]  Oh, the scoundrel loadout.
[6234.90s -> 6235.14s]  Okay.
[6235.14s -> 6236.02s]  I actually I should do that.
[6236.02s -> 6236.82s]  Let's try it.
[6236.82s -> 6238.34s]  Although I'm getting used to axe guy.
[6239.66s -> 6240.70s]  A lot of people coming up.
[6248.01s -> 6255.99s]  Oh, man.
[6255.99s -> 6257.35s]  That guy got killed by something.
[6257.35s -> 6259.67s]  I think that guy got trapped on here.
[6260.39s -> 6263.14s]  He's playing like G mod death run.
[6263.14s -> 6264.50s]  The guy like turned on the spikes.
[6265.14s -> 6268.39s]  Oops.
[6268.39s -> 6268.71s]  Sorry.
[6276.18s -> 6277.14s]  Oh, yeah.
[6277.14s -> 6278.74s]  That was team damage, but I killed somebody.
[6279.38s -> 6280.54s]  It's okay.
[6286.82s -> 6287.46s]  Oh, damn it.
[6288.18s -> 6289.30s]  Went in for a big hit there.
[6292.95s -> 6293.83s]  Where do you think you're going?
[6294.39s -> 6295.35s]  What was that guy doing?
[6296.07s -> 6297.85s]  There was no plan for that guy.
[6298.89s -> 6300.09s]  Oh, I walked into it.
[6300.09s -> 6300.33s]  Shit.
[6301.05s -> 6305.99s]  Saying sorry won't grow that guy's arms back.
[6305.99s -> 6306.47s]  That's true.
[6313.96s -> 6331.51s]  What the fuck?
[6331.51s -> 6340.46s]  What?
[6346.50s -> 6348.02s]  I must have got headshot by something.
[6348.58s -> 6358.70s]  Why are these guys?
[6358.70s -> 6362.52s]  What are you guys doing?
[6362.52s -> 6363.56s]  Guys, guys, guys.
[6364.12s -> 6365.94s]  All right.
[6365.94s -> 6367.30s]  We're going to have to quarantine this guy.
[6371.11s -> 6371.43s]  Excuse me.
[6371.43s -> 6372.71s]  Can we get a little help here?
[6372.71s -> 6375.67s]  This guy went rogue.
[6375.67s -> 6381.83s]  Oh, no.
[6381.83s -> 6383.99s]  He's been taken by the madness.
[6383.99s -> 6397.86s]  I kind of want to get in a horse
[6397.86s -> 6407.43s]  and just ride around like an asshole like that.
[6408.71s -> 6416.78s]  I thought there was a guy hiding.
[6416.78s -> 6417.50s]  Oh, damn it.
[6417.50s -> 6418.22s]  That guy would have been dead.
[6418.94s -> 6419.94s]  What?
[6419.94s -> 6422.02s]  Just what is killing me from behind?
[6422.74s -> 6423.74s]  All right.
[6423.74s -> 6424.54s]  I want to do.
[6424.54s -> 6425.34s]  Whoops.
[6425.34s -> 6426.76s]  Let's try scoundrel.
[6432.12s -> 6432.60s]  It's me.
[6435.64s -> 6437.59s]  Okay.
[6437.59s -> 6438.23s]  So what do you have?
[6438.23s -> 6439.91s]  I got fireball.
[6439.91s -> 6441.11s]  This is the guy that's like the magician.
[6441.11s -> 6441.35s]  Okay.
[6442.15s -> 6449.48s]  So what's the swings like?
[6449.48s -> 6451.80s]  A lot of thrusts, I would say, with this dude.
[6452.52s -> 6460.79s]  There it is.
[6462.57s -> 6463.13s]  All right.
[6463.13s -> 6463.53s]  Behind.
[6464.25s -> 6465.70s]  Oh, shit.
[6468.87s -> 6470.47s]  This guy ain't going to make it out alive.
[6470.47s -> 6470.79s]  No.
[6470.79s -> 6471.67s]  Right into my sword.
[6471.67s -> 6472.23s]  Come here.
[6472.23s -> 6472.79s]  Right into it.
[6476.28s -> 6476.68s]  Really?
[6487.72s -> 6488.12s]  What?
[6488.12s -> 6489.08s]  He don't go.
[6489.08s -> 6490.28s]  God, I don't care.
[6490.28s -> 6491.40s]  That was bullshit.
[6492.89s -> 6494.09s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[6501.61s -> 6502.01s]  He can't...
[6502.01s -> 6502.17s]  I...
[6504.17s -> 6505.21s]  I don't even need to say anything.
[6505.21s -> 6510.79s]  You guys already know.
[6510.79s -> 6518.09s]  You already know.
[6518.09s -> 6518.57s]  Swing.
[6518.57s -> 6519.37s]  What the hell?
[6519.37s -> 6520.01s]  What the...
[6520.01s -> 6520.57s]  Lag.
[6520.57s -> 6521.13s]  Lag.
[6521.13s -> 6521.69s]  Lag.
[6521.69s -> 6522.17s]  Lag.
[6522.17s -> 6522.49s]  Lag.
[6524.34s -> 6525.86s]  I tried to swing again.
[6525.86s -> 6526.74s]  Input.
[6526.74s -> 6527.46s]  Wasn't.
[6527.46s -> 6527.86s]  Done.
[6527.86s -> 6528.50s]  No input.
[6529.14s -> 6542.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[6542.58s -> 6544.02s]  I have an arrow in my arm.
[6552.26s -> 6552.58s]  What?
[6554.01s -> 6554.41s]  What?
[6557.45s -> 6558.41s]  I was doing all right.
[6559.05s -> 6562.44s]  He's a stab spammer.
[6563.00s -> 6568.82s]  They're having server issues due to way more people playing it than expect...
[6570.86s -> 6572.14s]  I thought that guy was aiming from my head.
[6572.70s -> 6574.06s]  I need to use the fire bombs too.
[6574.78s -> 6577.18s]  Is that a...
[6577.18s -> 6577.82s]  Who's up there?
[6578.38s -> 6579.50s]  Is that a guy in red or blue?
[6579.50s -> 6580.46s]  I can't tell.
[6580.46s -> 6582.41s]  I think he's blue.
[6582.41s -> 6585.70s]  All right.
[6585.70s -> 6588.18s]  I'm going to put this down in a strategic location after I do this.
[6593.00s -> 6593.40s]  Oops.
[6593.96s -> 6601.59s]  Did I just step in my own trap?
[6602.39s -> 6604.95s]  I was too busy paying attention to what this guy was doing.
[6608.09s -> 6609.29s]  Oh my god.
[6609.29s -> 6609.93s]  Okay.
[6609.93s -> 6611.05s]  No more scoundrel.
[6611.05s -> 6612.09s]  I'm going back to Raider.
[6612.73s -> 6616.46s]  That guy distracted me too much.
[6616.46s -> 6618.30s]  That guy distracted me into another class.
[6618.94s -> 6627.18s]  What a god.
[6629.26s -> 6629.74s]  I'm going.
[6629.74s -> 6630.30s]  You know what?
[6630.30s -> 6631.26s]  I'll show you what I'm going to do.
[6631.90s -> 6633.24s]  You want to see how we do this?
[6633.24s -> 6635.32s]  How I would do this in a real war.
[6635.32s -> 6639.13s]  I'll show you real war Elbertson right here.
[6645.21s -> 6645.61s]  Oh, fuck.
[6645.61s -> 6646.65s]  There's two of them.
[6646.65s -> 6647.50s]  I'm just kidding.
[6647.50s -> 6648.22s]  This is not what I would do.
[6648.86s -> 6658.30s]  Is this the guy laughing at me?
[6659.10s -> 6659.82s]  There's too many.
[6665.56s -> 6669.08s]  That guy didn't come over and start distracting me into another class.
[6669.08s -> 6671.46s]  All right.
[6671.46s -> 6672.58s]  We're getting kind of destroyed here.
[6676.42s -> 6676.90s]  Press V.
[6677.54s -> 6680.15s]  That's pretty good.
[6680.95s -> 6681.80s]  All right.
[6681.80s -> 6683.40s]  I should be able to get this guy from behind here.
[6684.97s -> 6686.09s]  Play it smart.
[6686.17s -> 6687.21s]  This guy's distracted.
[6688.97s -> 6690.49s]  Oh, caught him.
[6693.24s -> 6693.96s]  What?
[6693.96s -> 6695.72s]  What happened to my sword?
[6695.72s -> 6696.68s]  My axe?
[6696.68s -> 6696.84s]  My...
[6698.14s -> 6698.54s]  Okay.
[6699.10s -> 6701.26s]  I think it's because maybe the packet loss removed it.
[6710.14s -> 6710.64s]  Ah!
[6711.26s -> 6712.30s]  Oh no, I'm stuck.
[6716.23s -> 6718.31s]  God.
[6718.31s -> 6718.79s]  Get it!
[6722.98s -> 6724.18s]  You little weasel.
[6724.82s -> 6725.94s]  Nobody can catch him.
[6727.34s -> 6729.10s]  He's taking down our defenses.
[6729.10s -> 6729.90s]  All right.
[6729.90s -> 6730.38s]  Pickle.
[6730.38s -> 6731.50s]  Just like in baseball.
[6731.50s -> 6732.54s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[6732.54s -> 6733.34s]  You little rabbit.
[6737.38s -> 6738.66s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[6739.46s -> 6743.40s]  We were just chasing that guy in a circle and nobody could catch him.
[6744.12s -> 6751.74s]  We were gonna pickle him and it didn't work.
[6752.78s -> 6753.10s]  All right.
[6753.10s -> 6757.98s]  I'm gonna start playing the game again because I was top five and I'm like in the bottom.
[6764.65s -> 6765.37s]  Okay.
[6765.37s -> 6767.00s]  They're in our fort now.
[6767.00s -> 6767.56s]  This is bad.
[6768.20s -> 6783.19s]  I got it.
[6784.07s -> 6784.71s]  Relax.
[6784.71s -> 6785.43s]  Everybody relax.
[6786.15s -> 6788.15s]  They're gonna drop down here.
[6788.15s -> 6788.71s]  Watch this.
[6789.51s -> 6795.48s]  He's gonna drop down, isn't he?
[6795.48s -> 6795.88s]  Drop down.
[6799.96s -> 6800.28s]  All right.
[6800.28s -> 6803.00s]  Well, I made the board shake so he fell.
[6803.72s -> 6807.32s]  What is going on?
[6808.66s -> 6809.69s]  What?
[6809.69s -> 6810.19s]  Ow.
[6810.89s -> 6811.29s]  Ow.
[6811.29s -> 6811.93s]  Oh, there's a lot.
[6811.93s -> 6812.41s]  Never mind.
[6822.71s -> 6833.38s]  I somehow ended up back here and he ended up behind me.
[6833.38s -> 6837.30s]  I swung at that guy and then I teleported back and the guy was behind me and killed me.
[6840.94s -> 6841.82s]  What the heck?
[6842.62s -> 6843.50s]  No swear is here.
[6844.06s -> 6845.34s]  Only H-E-C-K.
[6849.30s -> 6850.74s]  They're gonna take it right now.
[6850.74s -> 6857.78s]  I'm trying to get this dude that's running behind.
[6859.90s -> 6860.30s]  Damn it.
[6861.50s -> 6861.90s]  Damn it.
[6861.90s -> 6862.62s]  Oh my god.
[6862.62s -> 6863.18s]  I helped him.
[6868.58s -> 6869.30s]  Wait.
[6869.30s -> 6870.58s]  That guy turned to dust.
[6871.46s -> 6872.26s]  How does that make it?
[6872.26s -> 6872.74s]  He said.
[6872.74s -> 6873.30s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[6873.30s -> 6873.86s]  He threw it.
[6873.86s -> 6874.58s]  Okay.
[6874.58s -> 6875.90s]  All right.
[6875.90s -> 6876.86s]  Get up on the battlements.
[6877.50s -> 6883.40s]  They're killing each other.
[6886.20s -> 6887.00s]  No, too many.
[6887.00s -> 6887.56s]  You're dead, man.
[6887.56s -> 6888.36s]  You can't be over there.
[6890.68s -> 6891.32s]  I gotta help them.
[6892.68s -> 6893.40s]  I'm going this way.
[6895.88s -> 6897.08s]  They're coming up here.
[6897.08s -> 6897.96s]  Scoundrel.
[6897.96s -> 6899.32s]  I'm taking his head off now.
[6899.32s -> 6900.52s]  You're not gonna get away with this shit.
[6903.94s -> 6904.50s]  Not this time.
[6907.69s -> 6908.41s]  Wrap around back.
[6909.05s -> 6915.69s]  Oh, this is bad.
[6915.69s -> 6916.01s]  They know.
[6927.98s -> 6929.98s]  Oh, kill the archer.
[6929.98s -> 6930.62s]  Kill the archer.
[6930.62s -> 6931.26s]  Kill the archer.
[6931.26s -> 6934.98s]  Kill the archer.
[6934.98s -> 6936.42s]  Oh, I had too many people behind me.
[6945.19s -> 6948.09s]  15.
[6948.09s -> 6949.05s]  Die to the archer?
[6950.23s -> 6952.23s]  No, I died to archer.
[6952.87s -> 6953.99s]  I finally got money.
[6954.86s -> 6958.06s]  You're talking about died to the eight people that were behind me.
[6962.14s -> 6963.74s]  Oh, I think that we cannot.
[6963.74s -> 6964.46s]  Is it gonna be good?
[6967.58s -> 6968.38s]  I like this game mode, though.
[6968.38s -> 6969.18s]  It's fun.
[6969.18s -> 6974.95s]  Progression seems to be working.
[6976.65s -> 6982.73s]  That's good.
[6982.73s -> 6984.09s]  Chase that paper.
[6984.09s -> 6986.89s]  I want to see what other weapons they have.
[6987.45s -> 6989.85s]  All right.
[6989.85s -> 6990.49s]  Who do I like?
[6992.74s -> 6995.83s]  I don't know.
[6996.47s -> 6997.99s]  They're all kind of fun to play.
[6997.99s -> 6998.95s]  We try archer again.
[7010.22s -> 7011.74s]  Unarmed or bust?
[7011.74s -> 7013.42s]  No, I'm not very good with unarmed.
[7013.42s -> 7015.82s]  Can we both get on?
[7021.19s -> 7023.51s]  There's many more weapons for you to customize.
[7023.51s -> 7024.07s]  That's awesome.
[7024.63s -> 7027.69s]  So we got our first.
[7035.38s -> 7039.72s]  Oh, that was a guy in VR chat.
[7039.72s -> 7043.14s]  I'm gonna go this way.
[7043.70s -> 7045.67s]  I think they're wrapping around over here.
[7052.25s -> 7052.89s]  Yeah.
[7052.89s -> 7056.06s]  Watch out.
[7056.06s -> 7057.18s]  Get off the horse.
[7057.18s -> 7058.52s]  Yeah.
[7058.52s -> 7059.24s]  Oh, fuck.
[7063.24s -> 7065.32s]  Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[7065.96s -> 7067.98s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[7067.98s -> 7073.10s]  I just ran in with the horse.
[7078.54s -> 7079.98s]  You've been hunted.
[7079.98s -> 7081.53s]  I'm gonna get a good perch.
[7082.09s -> 7086.65s]  Looks like we're right in the middle.
[7087.21s -> 7089.90s]  What's with all the swords there?
[7089.90s -> 7090.94s]  This guy's taking out everybody.
[7090.94s -> 7091.26s]  Really?
[7091.98s -> 7093.77s]  Come on.
[7093.77s -> 7095.91s]  He just took out three people.
[7104.22s -> 7105.82s]  This guy is killing everyone.
[7116.38s -> 7117.42s]  Oh my god.
[7119.82s -> 7121.98s]  I've done 50 something damage to him so far.
[7122.78s -> 7123.50s]  Did I kill him?
[7124.97s -> 7125.85s]  Jesus.
[7125.85s -> 7127.53s]  That guy was unstoppable.
[7127.53s -> 7153.45s]  Got him.
[7153.45s -> 7154.33s]  Damn.
[7154.33s -> 7165.43s]  I'm actually glad that the arrows are hard to use
[7165.43s -> 7166.49s]  because they're not.
[7167.45s -> 7167.85s]  Oh my god.
[7167.85s -> 7168.49s]  There's somebody up here.
[7171.46s -> 7172.42s]  It's hard to use the bow.
[7172.98s -> 7178.25s]  You got to be really, really precise.
[7178.25s -> 7179.69s]  But it kind of has to be like that
[7179.69s -> 7181.69s]  because otherwise it'd be really, really powerful.
[7181.69s -> 7183.45s]  It was really, really easy to use.
[7193.70s -> 7194.74s]  There's crossbows.
[7194.74s -> 7195.14s]  Are there?
[7195.70s -> 7197.18s]  That's interesting.
[7197.74s -> 7198.14s]  All right.
[7204.50s -> 7205.38s]  I got him.
[7205.38s -> 7206.50s]  I got to kill him right away.
[7209.77s -> 7210.33s]  Oh, fuck.
[7210.33s -> 7211.69s]  He threw a fly.
[7211.69s -> 7213.21s]  I'm just being a dickhead now.
[7213.21s -> 7213.53s]  All right.
[7214.34s -> 7215.14s]  Back to Raider.
[7215.70s -> 7222.47s]  I'm trying to do too many things.
[7222.47s -> 7224.95s]  Stay with one thing and do it well.
[7225.51s -> 7227.08s]  I'm jumping around too much.
[7227.64s -> 7245.96s]  Okay.
[7245.96s -> 7246.36s]  Let's go.
[7252.87s -> 7253.67s]  Bring out the knives.
[7264.02s -> 7272.01s]  Oh, I got him right in the head.
[7272.01s -> 7272.65s]  Shit.
[7272.65s -> 7273.45s]  All right.
[7273.45s -> 7274.01s]  This is bad.
[7274.01s -> 7277.46s]  I don't want to be on the bridge.
[7277.46s -> 7280.50s]  Bridge bad because I can do that.
[7280.50s -> 7280.82s]  Yeah.
[7280.82s -> 7281.30s]  Okay.
[7281.30s -> 7282.42s]  Well, is that...
[7282.42s -> 7283.30s]  Does somebody...
[7283.30s -> 7287.24s]  I didn't get team killed, right?
[7287.88s -> 7288.60s]  No, I did.
[7288.60s -> 7289.16s]  No, I didn't.
[7299.90s -> 7300.86s]  Can you cut the bridge?
[7300.86s -> 7302.22s]  You might be able to.
[7302.22s -> 7302.54s]  Maybe.
[7303.10s -> 7312.09s]  This guy is...
[7312.81s -> 7313.70s]  Needs to die.
[7313.70s -> 7314.82s]  I'm going to go straight on.
[7326.81s -> 7327.45s]  That hurts.
[7327.45s -> 7328.41s]  Is he alive?
[7328.41s -> 7329.22s]  He's alive.
[7329.94s -> 7331.02s]  Fuck.
[7332.22s -> 7333.58s]  I thought he was dead.
[7333.58s -> 7334.30s]  He went on the ground.
[7343.77s -> 7345.21s]  I was hoping I was going to catch somebody.
[7345.21s -> 7345.93s]  One of those.
[7345.93s -> 7347.05s]  Just right like in the face.
[7347.69s -> 7348.17s]  All right.
[7348.17s -> 7348.65s]  Not good.
[7349.37s -> 7349.85s]  I'm going to go.
[7350.57s -> 7356.98s]  Watch out for the fire.
[7356.98s -> 7358.18s]  When the fire goes, I'm going.
[7359.13s -> 7360.65s]  They're climbing up and in.
[7360.65s -> 7362.41s]  They're going inside.
[7362.41s -> 7364.18s]  They're up here.
[7365.75s -> 7366.39s]  They're already in.
[7367.91s -> 7368.55s]  Oh, shit.
[7368.55s -> 7369.27s]  That guy looked blue.
[7369.27s -> 7370.23s]  Look at how blue that guy looks.
[7370.23s -> 7370.79s]  I'm so sorry.
[7371.43s -> 7373.11s]  He looked blue in the shadow.
[7373.11s -> 7373.99s]  He did.
[7373.99s -> 7375.19s]  He really did.
[7375.19s -> 7390.87s]  Are they clear out of here?
[7390.87s -> 7391.27s]  Yeah.
[7391.27s -> 7391.91s]  We're good.
[7391.91s -> 7398.10s]  Nice.
[7398.10s -> 7399.14s]  He's almost dead.
[7410.30s -> 7410.78s]  Cleaved.
[7416.63s -> 7417.67s]  Oh, shit.
[7417.67s -> 7417.99s]  Bad.
[7419.37s -> 7420.89s]  I had a chance there.
[7420.89s -> 7432.49s]  Can you still do the overhead swing?
[7434.02s -> 7434.74s]  You can do this.
[7435.62s -> 7439.02s]  And then that's a little stab there.
[7439.02s -> 7443.53s]  The poke with the axe seems pretty bad.
[7444.73s -> 7446.41s]  Yeah, I would assume it would be.
[7446.41s -> 7448.46s]  Just try to change it up so they don't think
[7448.46s -> 7449.82s]  you're going to do the same swing every time.
[7458.57s -> 7460.33s]  I hit that guy right in the lip.
[7460.33s -> 7461.53s]  I busted that guy's lip.
[7461.53s -> 7462.49s]  I just gave a fat lip.
[7462.49s -> 7463.13s]  That's all I did.
[7464.58s -> 7465.06s]  Goodbye.
[7467.66s -> 7469.18s]  How that guy blocked so many hits.
[7469.18s -> 7470.06s]  What a fucking pro.
[7470.78s -> 7472.34s]  I ain't going to let you do that shit.
[7472.34s -> 7472.82s]  Sorry, dude.
[7479.24s -> 7481.64s]  No, somebody had to deal with you.
[7481.64s -> 7482.84s]  It might as well have been me.
[7489.32s -> 7489.82s]  Goodbye.
[7492.66s -> 7493.46s]  Huge cleave.
[7493.46s -> 7493.86s]  I love it.
[7499.88s -> 7500.68s]  Oops.
[7500.68s -> 7501.00s]  Hold on.
[7501.00s -> 7501.64s]  I'll help you here.
[7503.06s -> 7505.21s]  Oh, damn it.
[7505.21s -> 7505.85s]  I was trying to help.
[7506.49s -> 7507.99s]  We're going to kill each other in here.
[7510.92s -> 7511.16s]  All right.
[7511.16s -> 7512.36s]  With just too many of us in here.
[7512.36s -> 7512.92s]  This is bad.
[7515.35s -> 7516.87s]  That motherfucker is still alive.
[7519.75s -> 7520.47s]  Remarkably.
[7521.03s -> 7525.61s]  Okay, I'm going up this way.
[7526.17s -> 7530.84s]  We're going to push out of here.
[7531.93s -> 7532.57s]  Oh, dear.
[7532.57s -> 7533.13s]  They got a horse.
[7533.61s -> 7539.90s]  Where's he going?
[7539.90s -> 7542.81s]  He's all the way around.
[7542.81s -> 7544.41s]  He's going to wrap inside of here.
[7545.05s -> 7549.88s]  Where the hell did he go?
[7554.79s -> 7556.31s]  He keeps fucking team killing.
[7556.31s -> 7558.07s]  You fucking idiots.
[7560.06s -> 7561.26s]  That's not my team.
[7561.26s -> 7562.78s]  You can't blame that one on me, guys.
[7563.50s -> 7564.38s]  Not my team.
[7580.57s -> 7581.93s]  Oh, shit from behind.
[7581.93s -> 7582.33s]  Damn it.
[7582.97s -> 7584.17s]  I was going to look behind me, too.
[7585.05s -> 7590.15s]  Who knew this would get so heated in chat?
[7590.87s -> 7599.05s]  This dude's fucking team killing.
[7599.05s -> 7600.73s]  You fucking idiots.
[7601.45s -> 7608.15s]  Is there a way to shit from the front?
[7609.13s -> 7610.81s]  Oh, I see what you're doing here.
[7614.07s -> 7614.55s]  Damn it.
[7614.55s -> 7615.35s]  Fire sucks.
[7622.95s -> 7623.75s]  Did I get his leg off?
[7633.59s -> 7634.39s]  Holy shit.
[7634.39s -> 7635.59s]  I went backwards.
[7635.59s -> 7645.48s]  Was he hopping on one leg?
[7645.48s -> 7646.04s]  It looked like it.
[7646.04s -> 7646.28s]  Yeah.
[7646.84s -> 7650.07s]  All right.
[7650.07s -> 7650.87s]  Another string of legs.
[7650.87s -> 7651.83s]  Three, four in a row here.
[7652.39s -> 7654.39s]  I got to climb back up to like top five.
[7654.39s -> 7655.19s]  Come on.
[7655.19s -> 7658.49s]  I can't just be this bad.
[7658.49s -> 7659.13s]  I have to be good.
[7659.85s -> 7667.77s]  This is the first little area.
[7667.77s -> 7668.89s]  This is where it's contested.
[7669.45s -> 7669.93s]  You know what?
[7670.49s -> 7674.18s]  Is it...
[7674.18s -> 7675.62s]  Do I die if I go in the water?
[7675.62s -> 7677.22s]  I don't know if water's an instant kill.
[7677.22s -> 7685.14s]  All right.
[7685.14s -> 7685.94s]  Here's the conflict.
[7686.58s -> 7687.88s]  Watch from behind.
[7688.60s -> 7694.74s]  Who keeps team killing?
[7694.74s -> 7695.86s]  You fucking idiot.
[7696.50s -> 7701.14s]  Let's check in behind.
[7702.98s -> 7704.18s]  There's a person behind.
[7704.74s -> 7709.86s]  Is he still there?
[7714.17s -> 7717.13s]  Oh, you think you can escape me?
[7723.21s -> 7723.61s]  Oops.
[7726.58s -> 7727.06s]  Oh shit.
[7727.06s -> 7727.54s]  No.
[7727.54s -> 7727.86s]  I didn't...
[7731.93s -> 7734.41s]  I was locked in tunnel vision again.
[7734.41s -> 7736.17s]  Trying to hit that guy with an axe on the bridge.
[7736.89s -> 7749.37s]  Jeremy, you just team killed, you fucking idiots.
[7749.85s -> 7754.49s]  Jeremy, you just team killed, you fucking idiots.
[7754.49s -> 7754.81s]  What?
[7761.93s -> 7763.13s]  Well, I don't want to hit them.
[7763.13s -> 7772.34s]  It's going to be the same shit to you, man.
[7772.98s -> 7779.18s]  Too many, too many, too many.
[7779.18s -> 7779.58s]  They're all...
[7781.83s -> 7782.39s]  Too many.
[7783.75s -> 7784.39s]  Too many.
[7785.11s -> 7788.94s]  I got to get like...
[7789.50s -> 7792.26s]  Look at this ping.
[7793.88s -> 7795.80s]  Everyone's ping jumps up to like 400.
[7796.44s -> 7811.75s]  How many tickets do we need?
[7812.94s -> 7814.06s]  What are we playing until?
[7815.16s -> 7816.52s]  I'm sort of confused.
[7816.52s -> 7817.88s]  Is it like 1,800?
[7818.68s -> 7827.50s]  I really want to just dig in there.
[7828.22s -> 7833.85s]  Thank you.
[7838.41s -> 7839.53s]  That's what I wanted to do.
[7840.41s -> 7841.53s]  Just dig the fuck in.
[7847.40s -> 7848.36s]  No, fuck.
[7848.36s -> 7850.92s]  Oh, I'm so tunneled in.
[7854.47s -> 7855.75s]  I'm so tunneled in.
[7855.75s -> 7856.47s]  I just get...
[7856.47s -> 7858.87s]  All I think of is hit guy and face with axe.
[7859.43s -> 7868.58s]  I just...
[7869.70s -> 7870.74s]  Me swing axe.
[7871.70s -> 7873.22s]  Me do damage to face.
[7873.86s -> 7877.06s]  What about limbs?
[7877.06s -> 7877.30s]  No.
[7879.67s -> 7880.63s]  What about throw the axe?
[7881.67s -> 7881.91s]  No.
[7883.91s -> 7885.75s]  Only damage in face.
[7886.92s -> 7887.32s]  Only.
[7889.32s -> 7889.96s]  You're an idiot.
[7891.43s -> 7896.62s]  Okay.
[7896.62s -> 7898.46s]  Me only damage in face.
[7920.89s -> 7921.37s]  Me run.
[7924.47s -> 7925.43s]  Me run.
[7925.43s -> 7932.52s]  Is that guy red?
[7932.52s -> 7934.07s]  Why is he blue?
[7934.07s -> 7936.42s]  He's got blue tint all over him.
[7938.87s -> 7939.59s]  Me hit.
[7939.59s -> 7941.19s]  Me don't care if team or not.
[7941.19s -> 7941.91s]  Me hit face.
[7947.16s -> 7947.64s]  Me miss.
[7951.24s -> 7965.27s]  Me not very good at game.
[7965.27s -> 7967.35s]  Me not understand how ping work
[7969.51s -> 7970.79s]  seemed like should have landed.
[7973.83s -> 7974.39s]  Me dead.
[7974.39s -> 7974.79s]  Ah.
[7984.73s -> 7985.21s]  No, stay...
[7985.85s -> 7986.49s]  What do I play?
[7987.13s -> 7987.93s]  Footman?
[7987.93s -> 7988.81s]  I don't know.
[7988.81s -> 7989.29s]  I just...
[7989.29s -> 7990.17s]  I'm so excited.
[7995.32s -> 7996.84s]  Hey, can you stop hitting teammates?
[7999.30s -> 7999.54s]  No.
[8000.47s -> 8000.79s]  Why?
[8000.79s -> 8001.51s]  It's not that hard.
[8001.51s -> 8002.15s]  We have different...
[8002.87s -> 8003.59s]  Everyone's a different...
[8003.59s -> 8004.63s]  We're the same color.
[8007.26s -> 8007.58s]  Red.
[8008.14s -> 8008.38s]  Yes.
[8009.10s -> 8009.42s]  Okay.
[8009.98s -> 8011.37s]  Me hit red.
[8011.37s -> 8011.61s]  No.
[8019.46s -> 8020.98s]  I don't want you to hit red.
[8026.22s -> 8027.50s]  Me go for blue.
[8027.50s -> 8028.92s]  I try.
[8029.48s -> 8032.34s]  Well, try harder, stupid.
[8033.24s -> 8033.56s]  Okay.
[8055.29s -> 8056.17s]  Hey, don't do that.
[8059.10s -> 8060.68s]  What?
[8060.68s -> 8060.92s]  What?
[8060.92s -> 8062.36s]  I'm fucking confused.
[8063.08s -> 8081.37s]  Good thing he...
[8082.17s -> 8083.29s]  Don't do the joke play.
[8083.93s -> 8092.30s]  I had an opportunity there.
[8092.30s -> 8100.04s]  I had an opportunity to kill two, three people in a row.
[8100.04s -> 8113.58s]  I got a medic bag.
[8113.58s -> 8115.75s]  All right, let's give some poke.
[8117.51s -> 8119.77s]  Poke, poke, poke.
[8119.77s -> 8120.97s]  Find the opportunity.
[8120.97s -> 8123.21s]  Don't get involved in a situation
[8123.21s -> 8124.57s]  where you're going to get yourself killed.
[8125.70s -> 8126.50s]  Take it easy.
[8126.50s -> 8126.74s]  That's...
[8133.45s -> 8134.01s]  Okay.
[8134.01s -> 8135.37s]  I just stepped into the bonfire.
[8135.37s -> 8135.77s]  What was that guy?
[8135.77s -> 8137.93s]  That guy was holding his weapon the other way?
[8137.93s -> 8138.49s]  Oh, right.
[8138.49s -> 8139.77s]  Okay, that was confusing the fuck out of me.
[8140.33s -> 8142.17s]  Can I do that?
[8143.37s -> 8144.09s]  What does that do?
[8144.81s -> 8149.00s]  Does every weapon have, like, a different way to hold it?
[8149.72s -> 8152.07s]  I don't think so.
[8152.63s -> 8158.36s]  Most of them do.
[8158.36s -> 8158.60s]  Okay.
[8159.32s -> 8160.42s]  So now it makes it...
[8161.06s -> 8175.46s]  Stab.
[8177.53s -> 8177.93s]  Stab.
[8182.73s -> 8183.53s]  Really?
[8183.53s -> 8189.85s]  How did that not land?
[8189.85s -> 8191.45s]  I'm trying to kick him off the fucking edge.
[8194.70s -> 8195.58s]  Did I?
[8195.58s -> 8201.94s]  What happened?
[8201.94s -> 8203.38s]  I think he fell off.
[8204.02s -> 8204.74s]  I did.
[8204.74s -> 8205.86s]  I did what I wanted to do.
[8205.86s -> 8206.90s]  Yeah, he's dead.
[8206.90s -> 8207.30s]  He's dead.
[8208.26s -> 8208.90s]  Get the horse?
[8209.70s -> 8211.54s]  I feel like there's only one horse, and it only spawns...
[8212.26s -> 8214.33s]  We have one horse.
[8214.97s -> 8225.16s]  Oh, he had the five second life perk.
[8225.16s -> 8228.41s]  I did kill him, though.
[8228.41s -> 8229.69s]  That guy's coming in so much blood.
[8232.50s -> 8232.98s]  All right.
[8232.98s -> 8233.30s]  Let's pick...
[8239.54s -> 8240.26s]  Oh, come on.
[8240.90s -> 8241.54s]  Really?
[8241.54s -> 8244.26s]  Why the fuck am I so focused?
[8245.59s -> 8247.67s]  These huge, huge player battles...
[8248.79s -> 8249.59s]  My brain.
[8251.26s -> 8251.74s]  It's just...
[8253.02s -> 8256.46s]  I get locked into one thing for more than one second, and I'm dead.
[8256.46s -> 8258.31s]  Let's go knight.
[8258.87s -> 8266.04s]  When there's 50 people on the battlefield, I'm just like,
[8266.04s -> 8268.44s]  wait, what about this guy up there?
[8268.44s -> 8269.64s]  Oh, he's dancing.
[8269.64s -> 8270.92s]  Oh, that's fun.
[8271.56s -> 8272.70s]  And then I'm dead.
[8273.34s -> 8283.74s]  Hit ah?
[8283.74s -> 8284.46s]  Do ah?
[8284.46s -> 8284.86s]  All right.
[8284.86s -> 8285.74s]  I will.
[8285.74s -> 8294.18s]  I'm trying to just do not...
[8294.18s -> 8296.34s]  It's so easy to hit somebody in the head you don't want to hit.
[8302.74s -> 8303.06s]  All right.
[8303.06s -> 8303.78s]  I helped.
[8312.79s -> 8313.75s]  Ooh, got them both.
[8314.97s -> 8315.29s]  Ooh.
[8316.01s -> 8324.95s]  All right.
[8324.95s -> 8327.43s]  Give me that.
[8327.43s -> 8327.75s]  Whoa.
[8328.31s -> 8336.01s]  All right.
[8336.01s -> 8341.82s]  We're clearing them out.
[8341.82s -> 8344.31s]  Hey, don't do that.
[8344.31s -> 8349.11s]  Right into my trap that I didn't lay.
[8355.50s -> 8355.98s]  Archer.
[8356.54s -> 8359.00s]  Oh, that was delayed.
[8362.82s -> 8363.30s]  What?
[8363.30s -> 8363.78s]  I'm...
[8363.78s -> 8364.10s]  Okay.
[8366.81s -> 8368.33s]  That was odd.
[8368.33s -> 8369.98s]  Of course I...
[8369.98s -> 8371.34s]  Okay, of course I get hit.
[8371.90s -> 8379.53s]  I'm the one that takes the one hit in the head and dies.
[8380.09s -> 8392.81s]  I'm actually pulling it back.
[8392.81s -> 8400.58s]  It always happens to me.
[8400.58s -> 8401.62s]  It never happens to anybody else.
[8401.62s -> 8402.90s]  It only happens to me.
[8402.90s -> 8404.82s]  It's not fair.
[8404.82s -> 8409.42s]  Like, this guy doesn't have to deal with high ping.
[8409.42s -> 8409.74s]  Only me.
[8412.09s -> 8412.33s]  Okay.
[8412.33s -> 8413.13s]  This is a bad idea.
[8428.81s -> 8429.85s]  You're running into me.
[8431.53s -> 8432.81s]  Oh, god damn it.
[8433.62s -> 8437.70s]  I'm just like in the worst place at the worst time, apparently.
[8437.70s -> 8450.42s]  Oh, now I'm trapped in here.
[8450.42s -> 8455.03s]  This is not a place I want to be.
[8455.59s -> 8456.78s]  Too many bodies.
[8463.96s -> 8465.08s]  Anybody know what killed me?
[8465.64s -> 8471.91s]  That wasn't an arrow.
[8471.91s -> 8472.95s]  It was a mace.
[8472.95s -> 8490.44s]  Like a mace.
[8490.44s -> 8492.28s]  That's a team damage.
[8498.97s -> 8513.91s]  What are you doing here?
[8513.91s -> 8517.53s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8517.53s -> 8518.65s]  Oh, god damn it.
[8527.51s -> 8534.55s]  It's just such a mess.
[8534.55s -> 8535.75s]  Oh, sorry.
[8536.63s -> 8536.95s]  Sorry.
[8536.95s -> 8538.39s]  It was just medieval times.
[8538.39s -> 8539.51s]  It just happens.
[8539.59s -> 8543.90s]  I'm getting up there.
[8543.90s -> 8545.34s]  Somebody hit that guy.
[8545.34s -> 8551.00s]  I'm gonna fucking throw an axe at this guy.
[8557.56s -> 8560.28s]  Oh, he just moved at the fucking worst time.
[8574.76s -> 8575.32s]  He died.
[8575.32s -> 8576.42s]  He fell.
[8576.42s -> 8577.38s]  It's okay.
[8577.38s -> 8578.42s]  I've done it before, too.
[8587.00s -> 8587.80s]  Fuck, too many.
[8589.00s -> 8607.18s]  How are we still ahead?
[8607.18s -> 8609.26s]  I think the axe is my favorite weapon.
[8609.26s -> 8612.70s]  The bow is my favorite weapon, but I can't use it because I'm not good enough.
[8612.70s -> 8613.96s]  And I've accepted that.
[8614.60s -> 8626.94s]  Jesus Christ.
[8628.79s -> 8629.51s]  Jesus, man.
[8629.51s -> 8630.87s]  What, do I have a target on my back?
[8632.63s -> 8633.35s]  There's like four people.
[8643.21s -> 8663.05s]  It was like four of us standing there.
[8663.05s -> 8664.49s]  Upset because angry.
[8664.49s -> 8665.69s]  Mad because bad.
[8665.69s -> 8666.57s]  Bad because bad.
[8677.83s -> 8678.55s]  He blocked him.
[8678.55s -> 8679.35s]  He's blocking me.
[8679.35s -> 8681.03s]  We're just throwing rocks at this guy.
[8684.14s -> 8693.06s]  What?
[8693.06s -> 8694.10s]  All right.
[8694.10s -> 8698.65s]  This guy's gotta go.
[8698.65s -> 8699.21s]  Where is he?
[8715.56s -> 8716.36s]  Does that person...
[8717.45s -> 8718.33s]  That person had...
[8718.33s -> 8720.41s]  Wow, how did you do that?
[8720.41s -> 8721.61s]  How did you do that?
[8723.11s -> 8726.63s]  You have to have like eight arms with like three different mice to do what he just did.
[8727.27s -> 8732.47s]  He has like four keyboards.
[8740.87s -> 8742.23s]  Watch out for the archer.
[8742.23s -> 8752.31s]  Okay, good.
[8752.31s -> 8752.79s]  Charge.
[8752.79s -> 8755.34s]  I need health.
[8755.34s -> 8756.14s]  Okay.
[8756.14s -> 8756.78s]  Okay.
[8756.78s -> 8757.66s]  All right.
[8757.66s -> 8757.98s]  Okay.
[8762.84s -> 8769.78s]  I just got sacked.
[8769.78s -> 8773.70s]  I'm the fucking quarterback and the guy just sacked me.
[8773.70s -> 8774.02s]  What?
[8774.74s -> 8789.96s]  A meltdown stream.
[8790.60s -> 8792.60s]  No, I just hiked the ball.
[8792.60s -> 8794.36s]  It was 10 defensive linemen there.
[8794.36s -> 8795.48s]  Offensive linemen.
[8795.48s -> 8797.24s]  And he got through them and he sacked me.
[8797.24s -> 8800.20s]  All right, I want to do a different game mode.
[8808.81s -> 8809.77s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[8809.77s -> 8810.57s]  Yeah, I want to make a class.
[8817.46s -> 8820.90s]  Room temperature IQ rants about game mechanics.
[8820.90s -> 8826.18s]  That was a 500 ping server.
[8826.18s -> 8829.06s]  I'm not going to let that hurt me because no fucking way.
[8840.44s -> 8841.32s]  I can't believe it.
[8841.32s -> 8844.28s]  You have it like people jumping in front of you and killing you.
[8844.28s -> 8846.76s]  You jump up to 650 ping.
[8847.56s -> 8850.20s]  Now, you just got a room temperature IQ.
[8852.74s -> 8853.86s]  Out of here with that.
[8855.88s -> 8857.40s]  I can hear that.
[8857.40s -> 8867.51s]  Whatever.
[8867.51s -> 8867.99s]  I don't care.
[8872.78s -> 8873.34s]  One point.
[8873.34s -> 8874.46s]  Okay, it's 16 points.
[8882.50s -> 8884.02s]  IQ test stream.
[8884.02s -> 8885.14s]  No, I'm just fucking around.
[8885.14s -> 8886.10s]  I'm not mad.
[8886.10s -> 8886.98s]  I'm just fucking around.
[8887.62s -> 8891.88s]  I can't unlock this?
[8893.56s -> 8893.88s]  Why?
[8894.52s -> 8904.01s]  Two points.
[8904.01s -> 8907.72s]  Don't I have 16 points?
[8907.72s -> 8909.08s]  I don't have it unlocked.
[8911.54s -> 8912.90s]  Oh, okay.
[8913.70s -> 8916.22s]  So I don't have anything unlocked.
[8916.22s -> 8920.55s]  So I can't make a custom class unless I do nothing.
[8920.55s -> 8920.95s]  Fists.
[8927.18s -> 8928.30s]  Restart the game.
[8928.30s -> 8932.49s]  Okay, try that.
[8936.81s -> 8937.77s]  Mortal.
[8937.77s -> 8942.57s]  Let's try it again.
[8942.57s -> 8946.17s]  I'm sorry.
[8946.17s -> 8946.73s]  That was a lot.
[8947.53s -> 8955.88s]  It was too easy.
[8955.88s -> 8957.16s]  What are you talking about?
[8957.16s -> 8959.46s]  What are you talking about?
[8960.18s -> 8966.58s]  I already did that too.
[8966.58s -> 8967.78s]  That's unfortunate.
[8967.78s -> 8968.82s]  All right, can I?
[8968.82s -> 8969.62s]  No, can I?
[8975.35s -> 8976.71s]  There we go.
[8976.71s -> 8977.11s]  Okay.
[8978.57s -> 8980.09s]  500 gold to buy.
[8982.26s -> 8983.06s]  How much money do I have?
[8984.02s -> 8984.82s]  1120.
[8985.46s -> 8990.54s]  300 for a dagger.
[8990.54s -> 8991.74s]  Wooden mallet cleaver.
[8993.35s -> 8994.07s]  Primary.
[8994.07s -> 8995.51s]  Training sword.
[8995.51s -> 8995.91s]  Really?
[8995.91s -> 8997.35s]  You can use a wooden sword?
[8999.42s -> 9000.14s]  Quarter staff.
[9003.03s -> 9003.99s]  Arming sword.
[9003.99s -> 9005.67s]  Damage, speed, and reach.
[9005.67s -> 9006.63s]  I think I want this thing.
[9007.27s -> 9011.85s]  A little one-handed little...
[9011.85s -> 9022.14s]  I'm getting it.
[9022.14s -> 9022.86s]  Arming sword.
[9023.42s -> 9025.48s]  Secondary.
[9025.48s -> 9026.04s]  I want...
[9028.33s -> 9030.25s]  Oh, there's actually a lot of stuff here.
[9037.08s -> 9037.40s]  Wow.
[9037.40s -> 9038.12s]  Long sword?
[9038.12s -> 9038.68s]  No.
[9038.68s -> 9039.80s]  I had something small.
[9040.60s -> 9044.71s]  I need like a little secondary.
[9046.49s -> 9047.37s]  One two-handed.
[9047.37s -> 9048.49s]  One-handed shield.
[9048.49s -> 9048.73s]  Shield.
[9048.73s -> 9049.77s]  Maybe I should get a little shield.
[9051.00s -> 9051.80s]  A little targe.
[9052.52s -> 9055.43s]  I think I'm gonna get this.
[9063.90s -> 9065.58s]  And then a tertiary.
[9067.38s -> 9067.94s]  Bandage.
[9067.94s -> 9068.58s]  Quarter staff.
[9068.58s -> 9069.38s]  Training sword.
[9069.38s -> 9069.94s]  Fire bomb.
[9069.94s -> 9070.98s]  Maybe I should get the fire bombs.
[9071.54s -> 9073.46s]  Get the loot.
[9073.46s -> 9073.78s]  Rock.
[9076.15s -> 9077.51s]  I don't need to see anything else.
[9077.51s -> 9079.10s]  Okay.
[9080.06s -> 9080.46s]  Body.
[9081.10s -> 9081.42s]  Fat.
[9087.03s -> 9087.19s]  Okay.
[9088.23s -> 9089.40s]  Armor.
[9089.96s -> 9091.19s]  I don't have any more money.
[9097.82s -> 9099.58s]  I could make myself look like a total dickhead.
[9099.58s -> 9100.62s]  That's what I'm going for here.
[9103.32s -> 9104.92s]  I can't get anything else.
[9104.92s -> 9105.32s]  All right.
[9105.32s -> 9106.04s]  Shoulders?
[9106.04s -> 9106.28s]  No.
[9108.30s -> 9109.26s]  I have not enough money.
[9109.26s -> 9109.58s]  All right.
[9109.58s -> 9112.38s]  So then body, face, and voice.
[9120.14s -> 9120.54s]  Perfect.
[9137.82s -> 9139.74s]  This is just Geralt.
[9139.74s -> 9140.14s]  Whatever.
[9141.19s -> 9141.83s]  Facial hair.
[9149.03s -> 9149.67s]  All right.
[9149.67s -> 9153.16s]  So this is...
[9153.88s -> 9154.30s]  What?
[9154.30s -> 9155.02s]  You can...
[9155.02s -> 9156.38s]  I can actually do this?
[9156.38s -> 9156.86s]  Holy shit.
[9156.86s -> 9157.34s]  Wait a minute.
[9173.82s -> 9176.46s]  Guess it's not that big of a deal.
[9176.46s -> 9177.90s]  It's not that huge.
[9184.17s -> 9184.97s]  Five hours in.
[9184.97s -> 9186.09s]  We're at the character creator.
[9187.05s -> 9196.44s]  Okay.
[9196.44s -> 9199.05s]  That's fine.
[9199.05s -> 9200.65s]  So we have you.
[9200.65s -> 9202.49s]  I need to edit you.
[9202.49s -> 9206.47s]  We need to do skills, right?
[9206.47s -> 9207.27s]  Where's the skills?
[9207.91s -> 9211.90s]  And they're like perks there up here.
[9212.78s -> 9213.26s]  All right.
[9213.26s -> 9216.30s]  So a friendly fire reduction.
[9217.16s -> 9218.60s]  Absolutely.
[9218.60s -> 9221.53s]  Extra stamina on hit.
[9221.53s -> 9224.65s]  Full health on melee kills.
[9224.65s -> 9227.56s]  And reduces fire damage by 80%
[9227.56s -> 9229.08s]  because I walk in it all the time.
[9229.08s -> 9230.97s]  I think they're ready.
[9230.97s -> 9235.13s]  There's better armor for free.
[9237.48s -> 9238.12s]  Oh.
[9238.12s -> 9241.91s]  There is.
[9242.47s -> 9249.14s]  But it costs one point.
[9249.14s -> 9251.64s]  I think it's all right for now.
[9251.64s -> 9253.16s]  There's more free armor.
[9253.16s -> 9253.80s]  Chainmail.
[9253.80s -> 9254.52s]  Oh.
[9254.52s -> 9255.93s]  What level am I?
[9256.57s -> 9256.81s]  Two.
[9257.53s -> 9259.53s]  I can do chainmail, but it's two points.
[9259.53s -> 9260.73s]  So that means I have to remove...
[9261.85s -> 9262.81s]  These are very important
[9262.81s -> 9263.93s]  because I'm fucking terrible.
[9267.94s -> 9269.46s]  You're wearing a hospital gown.
[9270.58s -> 9275.72s]  All right.
[9275.72s -> 9284.15s]  I'll get it.
[9284.15s -> 9284.79s]  Metal tint?
[9286.12s -> 9286.84s]  Oh, that's cool.
[9293.42s -> 9294.38s]  Hospital gown.
[9298.58s -> 9298.90s]  Okay.
[9299.54s -> 9300.47s]  Let me see.
[9300.47s -> 9302.23s]  That's all I can do.
[9302.23s -> 9302.79s]  Chainmail.
[9302.79s -> 9303.03s]  Legs.
[9303.03s -> 9303.99s]  I don't need them.
[9303.99s -> 9306.06s]  I'm ready to fight.
[9308.20s -> 9308.52s]  Fight.
[9310.02s -> 9311.94s]  Should I do battle royale again?
[9311.94s -> 9312.90s]  Try BR again?
[9318.26s -> 9318.74s]  Horde mode.
[9318.74s -> 9319.06s]  Let's try.
[9319.06s -> 9322.84s]  I'm gonna try BR again.
[9322.84s -> 9323.24s]  I know.
[9323.24s -> 9323.48s]  I know.
[9323.48s -> 9323.80s]  I know.
[9323.80s -> 9325.72s]  I don't want to watch you do battle royale.
[9325.72s -> 9326.76s]  You fucking wanker.
[9327.48s -> 9329.02s]  You fucking wanker.
[9330.74s -> 9331.14s]  Relax.
[9341.18s -> 9342.06s]  What is horde mode?
[9342.06s -> 9342.70s]  Oh.
[9342.70s -> 9345.24s]  It's probably just survival.
[9348.30s -> 9349.90s]  I think you're the one that needs to relax.
[9352.71s -> 9353.43s]  No, I'm fine.
[9354.23s -> 9354.87s]  You relax.
[9355.94s -> 9357.94s]  How about we all collectively relax at the same time?
[9358.50s -> 9364.14s]  See?
[9364.14s -> 9364.94s]  Don't you feel better?
[9370.68s -> 9371.72s]  You fucking relax.
[9373.69s -> 9374.97s]  And no, you relax.
[9374.97s -> 9375.85s]  Yeah, you relax.
[9376.57s -> 9378.81s]  Check my emails while we hang out here.
[9382.12s -> 9383.96s]  I'm just gonna read you the first email that I have in my inbox.
[9388.22s -> 9389.50s]  It's from JetBlue.
[9389.50s -> 9397.82s]  It's talking about how there's sale right now for airfare, I guess.
[9397.82s -> 9400.98s]  Interestingly enough, this is just my first email.
[9400.98s -> 9401.62s]  Okay.
[9401.62s -> 9404.71s]  I'm not kidding around.
[9404.71s -> 9406.15s]  First email, almost.
[9406.15s -> 9409.24s]  You still use email, but you don't have an email?
[9410.04s -> 9411.32s]  How do you not have an email?
[9412.57s -> 9415.69s]  How do you get a bunch of stuff you don't want to open, a bunch of trash?
[9415.69s -> 9421.82s]  How do you go to a retail store and give them your email so they leave you alone?
[9429.98s -> 9431.26s]  You want to sign up for rewards?
[9431.26s -> 9431.50s]  Sure.
[9431.50s -> 9431.98s]  Who cares?
[9432.62s -> 9446.65s]  Guys, I have like, I'm pretty sure I have like 44,000 unread emails.
[9457.64s -> 9464.38s]  And I would say probably 80 to 90% of them are like coupons from Whole Foods.
[9470.23s -> 9471.11s]  Overhead swing.
[9471.67s -> 9476.02s]  Ooh, a little jab.
[9477.69s -> 9479.13s]  I didn't think I was gonna do that.
[9479.13s -> 9483.78s]  Who's next?
[9483.78s -> 9484.90s]  That was mine.
[9484.90s -> 9496.60s]  Did you sign up for the stupid rewards programs?
[9500.79s -> 9501.99s]  Yeah, but jokes on them.
[9501.99s -> 9503.99s]  I don't even open the email account.
[9503.99s -> 9506.86s]  You know, jokes on them.
[9506.86s -> 9510.78s]  They probably go to their email and they see that I haven't opened it.
[9511.34s -> 9513.94s]  This guy won't open anything.
[9513.94s -> 9514.66s]  What the fuck?
[9515.30s -> 9517.78s]  Because don't open it because then they'll know.
[9518.42s -> 9520.34s]  Their little read receipts will be on.
[9528.78s -> 9529.66s]  What am I doing?
[9541.37s -> 9543.29s]  Um, can I, can I run?
[9543.93s -> 9546.26s]  Is he dead?
[9547.99s -> 9549.91s]  No, stop rubber banding me around.
[9553.00s -> 9554.60s]  That's a loud and scary noise.
[9555.72s -> 9567.21s]  Well, I got on a horse and punched somebody and then I ran in place for five seconds.
[9567.85s -> 9583.14s]  That was a rage quit?
[9583.14s -> 9583.54s]  No, it wasn't.
[9583.54s -> 9584.58s]  I got kicked out.
[9585.14s -> 9587.46s]  All right, try this one more time.
[9599.59s -> 9600.63s]  VR sucks.
[9601.19s -> 9604.04s]  Yeah, but that's, come on.
[9604.04s -> 9605.16s]  That's going to get me the views.
[9605.88s -> 9618.42s]  I would turn my webcam on and show you.
[9618.42s -> 9629.93s]  I was going to get me the fucking views, but dude, I have no clothes on.
[9629.93s -> 9634.33s]  All right, here we go.
[9635.83s -> 9637.51s]  I'm going to actually give it an attempt this time.
[9639.85s -> 9641.77s]  No face cam, no views.
[9642.49s -> 9646.71s]  Do I have arrows?
[9646.71s -> 9654.02s]  Oh shit, he has the same thing.
[9654.66s -> 9659.72s]  Got plenty of arrows.
[9660.28s -> 9662.50s]  Someone's going to drop down around behind me or something.
[9663.22s -> 9664.02s]  I hear somebody.
[9664.02s -> 9665.14s]  All right, I gotta move.
[9665.14s -> 9670.41s]  Got a crossbow as well.
[9670.41s -> 9671.61s]  I've never even used the crossbow.
[9672.33s -> 9672.89s]  Is it good?
[9680.26s -> 9680.82s]  Huh?
[9680.82s -> 9683.51s]  That's such a scary fucking noise.
[9683.51s -> 9686.46s]  They need to turn that down.
[9686.46s -> 9688.62s]  I think that's an arrow hitting right next to my head.
[9695.48s -> 9696.68s]  Okay, I gotta go back to the bow.
[9710.94s -> 9713.82s]  No, what the fuck?
[9713.82s -> 9714.70s]  Battle Royale.
[9716.07s -> 9726.30s]  You watch another streamer do it.
[9726.30s -> 9727.66s]  They won't be hard to find.
[9727.66s -> 9728.30s]  Trust me.
[9728.30s -> 9738.39s]  Did I just have somebody coming back?
[9738.39s -> 9738.87s]  Hey, dude.
[9739.99s -> 9741.99s]  I knew you said I could go find another Battle Royale stream.
[9741.99s -> 9743.27s]  I couldn't find one.
[9743.27s -> 9745.10s]  I searched.
[9745.10s -> 9747.10s]  I was down on the browse and the category list.
[9747.10s -> 9748.94s]  I didn't find anyone playing Battle Royale.
[9749.50s -> 9752.02s]  Are you sure?
[9752.02s -> 9755.54s]  Maybe that you were just speaking out of tone there.
[9756.18s -> 9760.95s]  That's what I would do if I was like a troll in chat right now.
[9760.95s -> 9762.71s]  I'd be like, hey, dude, I couldn't find anybody playing VR.
[9762.71s -> 9763.35s]  Could you play it again?
[9786.31s -> 9787.51s]  What's Battle Royale?
[9808.30s -> 9810.70s]  Just the word Royale makes me sad.
[9811.82s -> 9816.54s]  It shouldn't.
[9816.54s -> 9836.12s]  I don't think anyone's playing this mode.
[9836.12s -> 9838.76s]  Well, all right, let's try the actual browser.
[9838.76s -> 9840.12s]  Oh my god, what happened?
[9847.30s -> 9849.06s]  I think it started.
[9858.14s -> 9859.50s]  Check your emails in the meantime.
[9860.22s -> 9869.38s]  All right.
[9869.38s -> 9871.06s]  Arming sword at 60.
[9871.86s -> 9872.74s]  Oh, I see.
[9872.74s -> 9879.14s]  This is cool.
[9879.14s -> 9880.02s]  Bandage.
[9880.02s -> 9886.98s]  Maybe she got a bandage.
[9886.98s -> 9888.02s]  Wave one.
[9888.02s -> 9890.63s]  How easy is it to kill things?
[9890.63s -> 9893.78s]  How did you get a knife?
[9901.75s -> 9902.39s]  Where do they pour?
[9902.39s -> 9911.48s]  Is it just default enemies that you have to kill?
[9911.48s -> 9913.64s]  No, we're just playing Cod Zombies now.
[9913.64s -> 9914.12s]  Kind of.
[9915.75s -> 9918.52s]  I see them.
[9918.52s -> 9919.80s]  Don't go too far.
[9919.80s -> 9923.59s]  Don't go too far.
[9924.15s -> 9928.89s]  Is that an enemy?
[9934.01s -> 9934.49s]  Are we just?
[9975.86s -> 9987.21s]  All right.
[9987.21s -> 9988.65s]  Where are the enemies?
[9988.65s -> 9997.70s]  Do we have to go looking for them?
[9997.70s -> 10008.47s]  Are they just scattered around?
[10008.47s -> 10010.87s]  They don't like come in the same place, it seems.
[10010.87s -> 10021.40s]  The rock killed stinky rat.
[10021.40s -> 10022.60s]  Oh, they got in.
[10022.60s -> 10023.80s]  They got in.
[10023.80s -> 10025.56s]  The farmers got in.
[10025.56s -> 10029.93s]  This is great.
[10029.93s -> 10030.57s]  God.
[10030.57s -> 10037.16s]  Can I get his weapon?
[10037.16s -> 10052.74s]  All right, we did it.
[10052.74s -> 10053.38s]  How much money we got?
[10053.38s -> 10053.86s]  34.
[10053.86s -> 10054.90s]  All right, give me a weapon.
[10054.90s -> 10061.77s]  This side is 90.
[10061.77s -> 10066.89s]  Damn it.
[10066.89s -> 10070.41s]  Light legs, bandage, light helmet.
[10070.41s -> 10072.09s]  No, I need a sword.
[10072.09s -> 10076.36s]  God damn it.
[10076.36s -> 10077.48s]  Where's their weapon?
[10077.48s -> 10077.88s]  Over here.
[10080.66s -> 10082.66s]  Ammo, toolbox, chest.
[10082.66s -> 10085.80s]  This one's 50.
[10085.80s -> 10089.11s]  What about inside here?
[10091.46s -> 10092.10s]  Bear trap?
[10092.10s -> 10092.34s]  No.
[10098.74s -> 10101.21s]  I'm not picking up any of that.
[10101.21s -> 10101.93s]  Buy a sword?
[10101.93s -> 10105.51s]  Yeah, I mean, I bought a rock.
[10111.59s -> 10112.39s]  Rusty fork.
[10112.39s -> 10113.51s]  I really don't have enough.
[10114.89s -> 10115.77s]  Rock OP.
[10115.77s -> 10117.93s]  Yeah, I'm just going to hit people in the face of the rock.
[10117.93s -> 10121.99s]  Do I have to throw it?
[10121.99s -> 10123.11s]  Does it throw?
[10123.11s -> 10123.75s]  Yeah, it does.
[10129.88s -> 10130.52s]  Got him.
[10130.52s -> 10133.80s]  We got two more.
[10136.52s -> 10138.38s]  Fuck.
[10138.38s -> 10140.38s]  Oh, that somehow got me.
[10140.38s -> 10140.94s]  I got a rock.
[10140.94s -> 10141.74s]  I'm dead.
[10141.74s -> 10143.10s]  I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[10150.06s -> 10151.74s]  What, he got me with the backswing?
[10153.00s -> 10154.44s]  He went all the way back?
[10170.39s -> 10171.27s]  Buy a sword?
[10171.27s -> 10171.67s]  I don't know.
[10171.67s -> 10172.79s]  I don't even know where they are.
[10175.35s -> 10176.39s]  Where are the weapons?
[10179.96s -> 10181.72s]  They're just randomly kind of scattered out.
[10181.72s -> 10184.20s]  There's like a dagger over here in this tent.
[10184.20s -> 10186.52s]  There's a bear trap in there.
[10187.78s -> 10189.54s]  Nothing in there as chests over here.
[10190.87s -> 10191.75s]  Rock at the fire.
[10196.95s -> 10199.75s]  All right, I'm going to go in here and get the dagger.
[10199.75s -> 10227.61s]  It's near the spawn.
[10228.49s -> 10231.19s]  So like back here.
[10241.30s -> 10242.66s]  Ye olde no sword.
[10242.66s -> 10243.38s]  Well, here they are.
[10244.74s -> 10245.70s]  I can't afford them.
[10245.70s -> 10247.93s]  There's those two.
[10247.93s -> 10257.74s]  Where's that dagger?
[10257.74s -> 10259.02s]  I can get a chest.
[10259.02s -> 10260.90s]  Is it worth getting a chest?
[10260.90s -> 10262.65s]  I'm going to try it.
[10262.65s -> 10267.78s]  Oh, nice.
[10267.78s -> 10270.70s]  I got something to peel fucking apples with.
[10270.70s -> 10279.96s]  Anybody need a potato peel?
[10279.96s -> 10281.40s]  Well, that's what I can do with this.
[10281.40s -> 10292.86s]  Just throw it into the darkness.
[10293.42s -> 10296.09s]  This thing is so tiny.
[10296.09s -> 10297.61s]  How am I going to kill anybody with this?
[10319.61s -> 10321.86s]  What?
[10321.86s -> 10323.62s]  Oh, get away from me, please.
[10334.57s -> 10335.45s]  Oh my goodness.
[10345.02s -> 10346.22s]  Well, I didn't do the worst.
[10354.71s -> 10357.40s]  Uh, I want to play the actual game.
[10363.51s -> 10368.87s]  I want to play the actual video game against other players.
[10372.55s -> 10373.43s]  It's BR.
[10373.43s -> 10374.39s]  No, it's not.
[10374.39s -> 10378.54s]  All right, I'm going for it.
[10378.54s -> 10386.52s]  Out of 64.
[10386.52s -> 10387.08s]  There we go.
[10390.46s -> 10391.02s]  What is this?
[10391.02s -> 10391.74s]  Game mode?
[10391.74s -> 10401.32s]  Is this protector?
[10401.32s -> 10411.45s]  Do I have to wait till another game starts?
[10412.01s -> 10416.38s]  How much is the game?
[10416.38s -> 10420.60s]  It's like 26, 27 right now, right?
[10420.60s -> 10422.52s]  Oh, it's only one life per round.
[10422.52s -> 10422.84s]  Damn.
[10422.84s -> 10424.70s]  All right.
[10424.70s -> 10425.66s]  How did that guy?
[10425.66s -> 10429.10s]  That guy fell off and grabbed the ledge and didn't fall.
[10429.26s -> 10431.26s]  That was incredible.
[10431.26s -> 10439.99s]  It's like red has the upper hand.
[10439.99s -> 10443.53s]  Not really though.
[10443.53s -> 10444.57s]  Turn around.
[10444.57s -> 10445.85s]  Everybody has tunnel vision.
[10445.85s -> 10447.69s]  It's so easy to get tunnel vision in this game.
[10447.69s -> 10455.38s]  It seriously is.
[10455.38s -> 10461.80s]  No, you're dead.
[10461.80s -> 10463.48s]  All right, here we go.
[10463.48s -> 10465.16s]  Let's see how long I can last.
[10465.16s -> 10495.77s]  Watch out to your side.
[10495.77s -> 10510.73s]  Protector, get behind me.
[10510.73s -> 10521.18s]  Behind.
[10521.18s -> 10523.56s]  Nuh-uh.
[10523.56s -> 10529.46s]  Oh, that's what we call a double kill.
[10529.46s -> 10532.12s]  It's when you kill two people at the same time.
[10532.12s -> 10533.48s]  And I don't know if you've ever heard it before.
[10533.48s -> 10542.98s]  I have a little bit.
[10542.98s -> 10543.46s]  Oh, fuck.
[10543.46s -> 10543.78s]  Oh, fuck.
[10543.78s -> 10544.10s]  Oh, fuck.
[10544.10s -> 10544.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[10548.84s -> 10554.49s]  Oh, I was the only one left.
[10554.49s -> 10556.17s]  I would say it was 1 v 10.
[10558.17s -> 10559.21s]  That was ridiculous.
[10559.21s -> 10562.01s]  I thought tunnel vision, 2.0.
[10562.01s -> 10567.13s]  I didn't even know I was the last person left.
[10567.13s -> 10568.57s]  Oh, I thought I could catch him.
[10568.57s -> 10575.21s]  Let's fuck the whole thing up.
[10575.21s -> 10576.17s]  Watch this.
[10576.17s -> 10588.30s]  No.
[10588.68s -> 10601.56s]  Yeah, not a fall joke.
[10601.56s -> 10602.84s]  It was actually fall.
[10602.84s -> 10604.20s]  Fucking god damn it.
[10604.20s -> 10604.76s]  No.
[10604.76s -> 10605.64s]  Why?
[10605.64s -> 10619.82s]  It's called disorienting.
[10620.38s -> 10623.42s]  Okay, blue team is so much better.
[10623.42s -> 10627.70s]  I don't think anybody on blue team died.
[10627.70s -> 10628.66s]  That's not fair.
[10628.66s -> 10631.62s]  You can't put the NFL team against the Pee Wee team.
[10632.42s -> 10633.86s]  What are you proving here?
[10633.86s -> 10639.59s]  What if you're gonna get two yards?
[10639.59s -> 10641.67s]  That's another football reference if you're counting.
[10641.67s -> 10642.47s]  It's been at least two.
[10643.11s -> 10653.14s]  Fuck, I'm dead.
[10653.70s -> 10655.14s]  I'm just getting fucking rolled.
[10655.78s -> 10670.31s]  Stay alive.
[10670.31s -> 10670.87s]  You can do it.
[10671.35s -> 10680.98s]  How many are left?
[10680.98s -> 10681.30s]  Come on.
[10681.30s -> 10682.42s]  There's only this.
[10682.42s -> 10685.74s]  I know you can do it.
[10685.74s -> 10686.94s]  My pregnant.
[10686.94s -> 10688.30s]  My girlfriend pregnant.
[10688.94s -> 10689.66s]  You can do it.
[10689.66s -> 10690.46s]  Get him.
[10690.46s -> 10691.58s]  Come out of AFT.
[10691.58s -> 10692.30s]  That's too bad.
[10693.30s -> 10693.94s]  That's too bad.
[10694.58s -> 10696.73s]  There was an opportunity there.
[10696.73s -> 10703.90s]  We're getting so badly beat.
[10710.09s -> 10710.65s]  All right.
[10710.65s -> 10712.18s]  I gotta step it up here.
[10712.18s -> 10713.14s]  Come on.
[10713.14s -> 10714.95s]  Step it up.
[10714.95s -> 10716.23s]  Red team blows.
[10716.23s -> 10717.35s]  Hey, don't say that.
[10727.56s -> 10727.96s]  Good.
[10727.96s -> 10728.60s]  Good.
[10728.60s -> 10730.70s]  Push him back.
[10743.80s -> 10745.32s]  Just fucking killed it.
[10751.64s -> 10752.68s]  It's too much.
[10752.68s -> 10754.60s]  When we're getting beat this bad.
[10756.65s -> 10757.93s]  There's bound to be some cows.
[10757.93s -> 10759.21s]  I gotta change class.
[10759.21s -> 10761.45s]  I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go Raider.
[10764.14s -> 10767.50s]  He pushed him into me and I hit him right in the face with a swing.
[10767.50s -> 10770.46s]  But when we're losing this badly, there's only, look.
[10770.94s -> 10773.10s]  Oh, I thought that was the girlfriend guy.
[10773.10s -> 10781.98s]  Are we gonna win?
[10782.62s -> 10783.10s]  Holy shit.
[10783.10s -> 10783.66s]  How did they?
[10783.66s -> 10784.94s]  Were they just sitting in the back?
[10784.94s -> 10786.30s]  How did you guys pull this off?
[10787.10s -> 10792.12s]  I can't believe we just won.
[10792.12s -> 10795.24s]  Wasn't there just a bunch of blue and not a bunch of red?
[10795.96s -> 10799.32s]  Is the strategy to be AFK?
[10800.46s -> 10801.02s]  Holy shit.
[10801.02s -> 10801.74s]  We actually did it.
[10805.93s -> 10806.73s]  Nice job, guys.
[10808.33s -> 10809.93s]  I think somebody's stuck inside of me.
[10811.19s -> 10814.70s]  Yeah, don't please.
[10814.70s -> 10820.41s]  Just don't shoot me.
[10821.88s -> 10822.76s]  Don't shoot me, dude.
[10822.76s -> 10825.13s]  Just he's trying to shoot me.
[10832.63s -> 10834.31s]  How did this even happen?
[10834.31s -> 10842.33s]  Somebody just killed one of us.
[10842.89s -> 10844.33s]  Just turn around and kill us, please.
[10849.90s -> 10850.22s]  Okay.
[10853.93s -> 10854.33s]  I don't know.
[10855.30s -> 10856.58s]  That guy wasn't even connected to us.
[10865.05s -> 10865.53s]  Got you.
[10870.07s -> 10871.67s]  Oh, that was an uppercut.
[10871.67s -> 10881.45s]  Got you.
[10881.45s -> 10884.22s]  I had a chance.
[10889.43s -> 10889.75s]  Fuck.
[10900.47s -> 10901.27s]  Changing maps.
[10901.27s -> 10902.31s]  This is kind of fun.
[10902.31s -> 10903.82s]  This is fun.
[10909.43s -> 10911.67s]  I think the game is more addicting than chivalry.
[10911.67s -> 10919.53s]  Chivalry was a lot of fun.
[10919.53s -> 10922.81s]  All right, skirmish, team deathmatch.
[10922.81s -> 10924.25s]  Hold on, are we gonna do...
[10924.33s -> 10935.96s]  Does this mean it's 64 people or free-for-all?
[10935.96s -> 10936.60s]  No, okay.
[10940.66s -> 10943.53s]  Next day, Raider.
[10943.53s -> 10947.08s]  This game is a mess in comparison.
[10948.23s -> 10949.43s]  It's kind of fun that way, though.
[10949.99s -> 10966.65s]  That would have been a clip
[10967.29s -> 10969.13s]  that somebody would have saved if any of those had landed.
[10977.80s -> 10979.16s]  Hitmarker sound, yeah.
[10979.16s -> 10980.28s]  Oh, watch out.
[10980.28s -> 10992.02s]  Hello.
[10992.02s -> 10993.40s]  Who is it?
[10993.40s -> 10997.05s]  I think I just got shot in the back by the guy with the...
[10997.61s -> 11003.75s]  I'm in trouble.
[11003.75s -> 11004.71s]  There's so many here.
[11004.71s -> 11005.67s]  Oh, fuck.
[11005.67s -> 11006.39s]  Oh, my God.
[11007.35s -> 11009.10s]  Was it bear trap?
[11009.10s -> 11013.24s]  Oh, I thought I got shot from behind in the back of the head.
[11013.88s -> 11019.10s]  Am I a drumstick or am I a wingman?
[11019.10s -> 11019.58s]  Drumstick.
[11021.75s -> 11023.91s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[11023.91s -> 11025.91s]  You're putting this here to death.
[11025.91s -> 11027.43s]  It was there as a prank.
[11028.07s -> 11029.75s]  I got pranked by my own team.
[11029.75s -> 11030.55s]  That's what that was.
[11035.11s -> 11035.91s]  I've walked in...
[11035.91s -> 11037.27s]  Why is it in our spawn?
[11037.99s -> 11040.54s]  That's the question you should be asking.
[11041.58s -> 11044.06s]  Not did he walk in it, but why was it there?
[11044.86s -> 11046.84s]  You ever stub your toe on something?
[11048.39s -> 11050.55s]  You don't go, wow, he's literally blind.
[11050.55s -> 11053.26s]  Oh, my God.
[11053.26s -> 11055.98s]  So if a friend of yours stubbed their toe on a sofa
[11055.98s -> 11058.62s]  that's been in the same room for five years,
[11058.62s -> 11059.58s]  how many times have you done that?
[11060.22s -> 11061.43s]  What, you didn't know there was a sofa there?
[11061.43s -> 11061.99s]  Were you blind?
[11062.71s -> 11065.43s]  No, sometimes you just stub your toe on shit.
[11076.14s -> 11077.26s]  I do say that.
[11077.26s -> 11077.98s]  Well, you're mean.
[11078.54s -> 11079.42s]  Don't be so mean.
[11087.32s -> 11088.12s]  What the fuck?
[11093.88s -> 11094.92s]  Oh, my God.
[11097.88s -> 11098.52s]  What?
[11098.52s -> 11100.60s]  How did none of those hit anyone?
[11109.24s -> 11112.34s]  Statistically speaking, one of those had to have hit.
[11114.47s -> 11115.67s]  It's impossible to miss that.
[11117.26s -> 11117.82s]  No, it's not.
[11117.82s -> 11118.70s]  Never mind.
[11118.70s -> 11135.88s]  I was trying to parry it.
[11146.15s -> 11146.87s]  Easy.
[11146.87s -> 11151.48s]  I had to be right there.
[11163.67s -> 11164.87s]  Let's go up over the mountain.
[11165.43s -> 11169.16s]  Let's do a mountain run, first of all.
[11170.12s -> 11194.86s]  Second of all, it's really like playing the lottery
[11194.86s -> 11195.58s]  when you do that.
[11195.58s -> 11196.86s]  If you hit, it's fucking huge.
[11196.86s -> 11198.06s]  It's like a million dollars.
[11198.06s -> 11208.33s]  Okay, don't get stuck on the stairs here.
[11208.89s -> 11221.74s]  Damn it.
[11221.74s -> 11222.46s]  Oh, this is bad.
[11230.95s -> 11232.87s]  How many Mordhau montages are we going to get?
[11232.87s -> 11234.39s]  Depends on how good people are.
[11234.39s -> 11240.76s]  You got to get play by play.
[11240.76s -> 11241.88s]  I can't get play by play
[11242.36s -> 11245.08s]  because then I'll lose over and over again.
[11259.53s -> 11261.69s]  He came all the way back to the spawn.
[11265.66s -> 11265.90s]  Where?
[11266.78s -> 11267.58s]  He's still here.
[11268.62s -> 11269.90s]  I'm getting on the fucking horse.
[11271.24s -> 11272.20s]  Oh, my God.
[11282.81s -> 11284.17s]  That guy was reading the map.
[11285.03s -> 11286.07s]  Oh, my goodness.
[11298.09s -> 11299.53s]  That was a very quick match.
[11299.53s -> 11310.76s]  All right, I'm going to be my guy.
[11317.66s -> 11319.82s]  Stop team killing, you idiots.
[11319.82s -> 11325.46s]  I think I'll be all right with this.
[11325.46s -> 11326.10s]  I got rocks.
[11331.29s -> 11334.50s]  Okay, this is going to be the run.
[11334.50s -> 11336.82s]  This will be the round where I'm at least in the top five.
[11336.82s -> 11338.34s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[11338.34s -> 11340.74s]  I'm seriously going to put everything into this.
[11341.38s -> 11344.66s]  Here we go.
[11346.98s -> 11350.95s]  That's a cool hammer.
[11350.95s -> 11377.72s]  This is the enemy spawn.
[11381.88s -> 11385.77s]  You can't go down in the enemy spawn.
[11385.77s -> 11386.09s]  Why?
[11388.92s -> 11389.88s]  It just kills you.
[11391.80s -> 11407.40s]  I love it.
[11407.40s -> 11413.82s]  He's dead.
[11416.82s -> 11418.26s]  I have an axe in me.
[11418.26s -> 11420.02s]  I just took the axe out of my body.
[11438.86s -> 11439.74s]  Oh, he killed me.
[11441.46s -> 11443.22s]  I got a little too close to the teammate there.
[11443.22s -> 11445.22s]  He just kind of elbowed me in the mouth.
[11445.86s -> 11459.21s]  It wasn't my fault.
[11460.79s -> 11462.79s]  People are going to say it was, but it was not.
[11462.79s -> 11480.55s]  The head.
[11480.55s -> 11488.63s]  Right in the window.
[11488.63s -> 11492.09s]  Coming up.
[11492.09s -> 11493.21s]  I'm going to kick him right in the face.
[11493.21s -> 11494.01s]  Whoever comes up here.
[11494.57s -> 11496.73s]  Easy.
[11496.73s -> 11497.21s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11497.21s -> 11498.25s]  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[11498.25s -> 11498.57s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11498.57s -> 11499.96s]  Don't go up there.
[11499.96s -> 11502.28s]  Wait for them to come up and we can helms deep them.
[11502.84s -> 11504.20s]  Then you see helms deep.
[11504.76s -> 11505.96s]  Then you see them when we lord of the rings.
[11506.68s -> 11507.16s]  Turn around.
[11507.16s -> 11508.04s]  You're going to get sniped.
[11508.76s -> 11509.32s]  Turn around.
[11509.32s -> 11510.52s]  He's coming up there right now.
[11510.52s -> 11511.00s]  Look.
[11511.00s -> 11512.28s]  We're going to helms deep this guy.
[11528.18s -> 11530.89s]  I told you.
[11530.89s -> 11531.85s]  Did you see the movie?
[11548.36s -> 11549.32s]  I told you.
[11549.32s -> 11550.76s]  You got to watch out for that shit.
[11551.40s -> 11552.28s]  They ain't fucking around.
[11552.28s -> 11553.96s]  They really want to get up this ladder.
[11553.96s -> 11557.06s]  Can I throw this sword back at them?
[11557.06s -> 11557.46s]  Who's that?
[11560.50s -> 11561.86s]  Oh, they're coming in the other side.
[11561.86s -> 11562.82s]  I told you.
[11562.82s -> 11564.31s]  Apparently I told you.
[11564.31s -> 11564.87s]  I told you.
[11564.87s -> 11565.27s]  I told you.
[11565.27s -> 11565.75s]  I told you.
[11566.31s -> 11575.56s]  Watch the back.
[11575.56s -> 11575.80s]  Watch it.
[11575.80s -> 11576.60s]  They're going to climb up the ladder.
[11576.60s -> 11577.16s]  Helms deep.
[11577.16s -> 11577.96s]  I told you guys.
[11578.52s -> 11582.49s]  You act like you've never seen any of these movies.
[11583.05s -> 11599.94s]  I'm going to start spamming voice chat as close to the mic as I can get.
[11600.66s -> 11610.33s]  Well, that didn't do anything.
[11610.33s -> 11612.89s]  I still don't have the drop down on how hard those rocks get thrown.
[11613.45s -> 11617.74s]  Watch out.
[11617.74s -> 11618.54s]  Don't backswing me.
[11619.10s -> 11620.30s]  I just back.
[11620.30s -> 11620.62s]  Okay.
[11620.62s -> 11621.74s]  Well, I did what he...
[11623.70s -> 11624.74s]  It's too chaotic.
[11624.74s -> 11626.10s]  There's too many people on this server.
[11629.61s -> 11630.09s]  He's dead?
[11631.80s -> 11632.20s]  He's not dead.
[11632.20s -> 11632.52s]  He's not dead.
[11632.52s -> 11632.84s]  He's still alive.
[11632.84s -> 11633.32s]  He's still alive.
[11633.96s -> 11634.46s]  Oh wait.
[11634.46s -> 11635.10s]  We both died.
[11641.27s -> 11643.35s]  Where am I on the chart?
[11643.35s -> 11644.63s]  I'm not even on the chart.
[11644.63s -> 11645.83s]  That's how you know it's not going well.
[11645.83s -> 11647.43s]  I got to kill some more people here.
[11647.43s -> 11671.22s]  Oh fuck.
[11672.94s -> 11673.18s]  Kick.
[11679.77s -> 11680.33s]  What?
[11680.33s -> 11680.65s]  Okay.
[11681.29s -> 11682.41s]  Why couldn't I kick?
[11684.14s -> 11684.54s]  Okay.
[11684.54s -> 11685.66s]  I can kick now.
[11685.66s -> 11687.66s]  I was literally spamming this button.
[11687.66s -> 11689.02s]  Did I have no stamina?
[11689.02s -> 11697.69s]  Lord.
[11697.69s -> 11706.70s]  I spent all the stamina throwing rocks.
[11706.70s -> 11708.14s]  Well, I did hit that guy right in the face.
[11708.14s -> 11708.86s]  So it's worth it.
[11709.50s -> 11715.22s]  You can't kick with a ranged weapon out.
[11715.22s -> 11715.70s]  Oh, really?
[11716.26s -> 11718.44s]  I didn't even know that.
[11718.44s -> 11723.34s]  Good to know.
[11723.34s -> 11727.38s]  Every team I'm a part of loses.
[11728.31s -> 11734.09s]  Well, you could say that about all the other people on the team.
[11734.09s -> 11734.41s]  What?
[11743.54s -> 11744.58s]  They win sometimes.
[11748.90s -> 11752.74s]  There's almost 64 people in this server.
[11752.74s -> 11755.38s]  You're going to put it all on the one guy that's throwing rocks?
[11755.78s -> 11766.07s]  I need a better weapon than that.
[11766.07s -> 11766.95s]  I think it sucks.
[11766.95s -> 11790.20s]  I made him drop his lunch.
[11790.20s -> 11791.00s]  Oh, come on.
[11791.00s -> 11791.80s]  We were having a duel.
[11791.80s -> 11792.60s]  We're having a duel.
[11792.60s -> 11793.00s]  You can't.
[11793.00s -> 11793.24s]  Come on.
[11793.24s -> 11794.28s]  That's dishonorable.
[11797.64s -> 11799.24s]  Oh, this actually is just free-for-all, isn't it?
[11815.86s -> 11817.54s]  You goddamn opportunists.
[11840.30s -> 11841.42s]  You can't even.
[11841.42s -> 11864.20s]  You guys want to swing in a circle.
[11864.20s -> 11865.16s]  Who the fuck is this?
[11865.16s -> 11866.36s]  Is that Colonel Sanders?
[11881.93s -> 11883.69s]  Get Colonel Sanders out of here.
[11883.69s -> 11890.87s]  I thought I just had a shotgun.
[11890.87s -> 11898.36s]  That was my kill.
[11898.36s -> 11905.98s]  Oh, ow, ow.
[11905.98s -> 11918.50s]  You're going to club somebody?
[11918.50s -> 11919.22s]  No, I'm not.
[11919.78s -> 11930.31s]  Fucking 60 goddamn people here.
[11930.31s -> 11930.79s]  Watch this.
[11931.35s -> 11933.19s]  Want to see a real dickhead move?
[11933.19s -> 11938.18s]  I'm waiting for the spawn.
[11938.74s -> 11951.69s]  Where did you?
[11967.22s -> 11971.46s]  Just look at how far down I am.
[11971.46s -> 11987.90s]  I'm not even up there at all.
[11987.90s -> 11989.64s]  Oh, it didn't kill him?
[11989.64s -> 11990.76s]  How is that possible?
[12002.60s -> 12003.16s]  Get away.
[12005.54s -> 12015.77s]  I just turned into it.
[12015.77s -> 12019.21s]  AFK, AFK, AFK, AFK, AFK, AFK.
[12019.21s -> 12035.27s]  Come here.
[12035.27s -> 12037.78s]  There it goes.
[12037.78s -> 12038.34s]  See you later.
[12038.58s -> 12047.59s]  Oh, there's people just in every direction.
[12049.38s -> 12065.34s]  How did I end up like this?
[12066.60s -> 12067.40s]  Holy shit.
[12084.89s -> 12099.56s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[12099.56s -> 12102.15s]  Come on.
[12102.15s -> 12103.27s]  I got to get at least...
[12103.27s -> 12105.11s]  This guy has 29 kills.
[12105.11s -> 12105.91s]  My goodness.
[12123.54s -> 12127.85s]  It's really just swing horizontally
[12127.85s -> 12131.86s]  until you take off somebody's head.
[12131.86s -> 12133.62s]  It's just a horizontal swing
[12133.62s -> 12135.30s]  until somebody's fucking head comes off.
[12137.22s -> 12138.82s]  We're just trimming each other's hedges.
[12139.38s -> 12147.14s]  That was fun.
[12147.14s -> 12148.66s]  This game's a lot of fun.
[12148.66s -> 12152.90s]  All right.
[12152.90s -> 12154.58s]  A couple more and then I want to make a new character.
[12154.58s -> 12156.02s]  I want to actually buy something.
[12156.02s -> 12167.08s]  Let's go red.
[12167.98s -> 12168.70s]  And this time...
[12170.12s -> 12171.48s]  Oh, I'm going to go scoundrel.
[12172.98s -> 12174.02s]  I like the little stab.
[12174.02s -> 12176.50s]  I like the little thrusties like this.
[12176.50s -> 12179.29s]  You just dash forward
[12179.29s -> 12187.56s]  and I'll test it on this guy's mouth.
[12187.56s -> 12196.02s]  Here we go.
[12196.02s -> 12198.50s]  Four, three, two, one.
[12199.93s -> 12200.41s]  Go!
[12212.39s -> 12224.52s]  Oh, nice block.
[12225.90s -> 12227.82s]  Sorry, guys, but you're all going to burn.
[12227.82s -> 12234.84s]  It's all about the dance.
[12244.58s -> 12244.90s]  Oops.
[12251.10s -> 12254.78s]  Oh, you've closed yourself in.
[12254.78s -> 12255.58s]  All right.
[12255.58s -> 12270.76s]  Who's left?
[12270.76s -> 12272.36s]  Guys, okay.
[12272.36s -> 12273.32s]  Well, if you're going to do that...
[12276.76s -> 12277.16s]  See you.
[12279.69s -> 12280.33s]  Just a little.
[12280.33s -> 12282.01s]  All it takes is just a little bit.
[12282.01s -> 12291.64s]  Who's left?
[12291.64s -> 12292.44s]  Up top?
[12292.44s -> 12297.40s]  Who's this one person left?
[12301.32s -> 12309.82s]  Oh, we won.
[12309.90s -> 12311.02s]  Nice job.
[12311.02s -> 12311.90s]  If somebody throws...
[12312.46s -> 12314.46s]  Look at those Fortnite gamers in the middle.
[12314.46s -> 12315.98s]  Yeah, you guys are in the wrong game.
[12315.98s -> 12328.82s]  I thought it was right there.
[12340.18s -> 12340.66s]  Easy.
[12340.66s -> 12342.10s]  Too many, too many, too many, too many.
[12342.10s -> 12342.66s]  Back it up.
[12342.66s -> 12347.10s]  I'm not that I could do about that.
[12347.10s -> 12352.36s]  I didn't put the trap down, damn it.
[12352.36s -> 12357.13s]  There they go.
[12363.34s -> 12365.32s]  Yeah, that's too bad.
[12371.96s -> 12372.76s]  It's just good to...
[12372.76s -> 12374.04s]  It's a people-watching game.
[12374.04s -> 12374.60s]  It really is.
[12374.60s -> 12376.04s]  Because this guy has no idea.
[12376.04s -> 12377.32s]  And now there goes his leg.
[12377.32s -> 12378.84s]  And there's his buddy, Archer2,
[12380.04s -> 12381.40s]  desperately trying to fight off.
[12382.66s -> 12383.70s]  That guy didn't even know that
[12383.70s -> 12385.22s]  there were five people around him.
[12385.22s -> 12387.70s]  He found out that this many people were here.
[12389.19s -> 12390.63s]  Not even one second ago.
[12390.63s -> 12410.58s]  Oh, getting some points there.
[12411.38s -> 12412.26s]  Easy.
[12412.26s -> 12419.40s]  Caught him right around the corner.
[12419.40s -> 12421.24s]  You did exactly what I thought you were gonna do.
[12435.21s -> 12435.93s]  Poking away.
[12435.93s -> 12437.05s]  Just a little bit at a time.
[12437.05s -> 12437.53s]  He has his...
[12437.53s -> 12438.97s]  That's 138 damage.
[12438.97s -> 12440.25s]  This guy, how much health does he have?
[12440.25s -> 12453.86s]  All right, just the Archer over here.
[12453.86s -> 12460.17s]  I'm gonna get accidentally hit by this.
[12461.75s -> 12462.39s]  Nice swing.
[12462.95s -> 12465.46s]  Just these guys over here and that should be it.
[12476.25s -> 12477.77s]  I thought it was gonna spin it around.
[12480.94s -> 12481.90s]  Help! Help!
[12481.90s -> 12482.30s]  Guys!
[12482.94s -> 12483.34s]  Guys!
[12489.72s -> 12491.00s]  I don't want unnecessary death.
[12491.64s -> 12493.74s]  I need a weapon.
[12493.74s -> 12495.02s]  Who has a weapon on the ground?
[12495.02s -> 12504.20s]  Did we win?
[12510.49s -> 12513.27s]  What's going on here?
[12513.27s -> 12516.50s]  I'm not a coward.
[12516.50s -> 12518.90s]  I'm just trying to play my battles correctly.
[12518.90s -> 12520.34s]  Where is this person?
[12520.34s -> 12533.12s]  Hey!
[12535.03s -> 12536.79s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12536.79s -> 12540.95s]  Oh, there he is.
[12540.95s -> 12551.34s]  All right, not doing too bad this time.
[12551.34s -> 12557.96s]  Right in the corner here.
[12560.23s -> 12561.19s]  Right there, right when they turn around.
[12561.19s -> 12562.31s]  They're not even gonna see it.
[12562.31s -> 12567.99s]  I want to get a good fire bomb
[12567.99s -> 12568.79s]  right inside of there.
[12568.79s -> 12569.67s]  Right up back there.
[12570.23s -> 12575.05s]  I think I got hit by it.
[12575.05s -> 12576.41s]  I think I got hit in the head by an arrow.
[12583.75s -> 12586.49s]  Oh, a throwing axe?
[12587.75s -> 12589.35s]  From where?
[12589.35s -> 12590.97s]  I was inside the corridor.
[12591.53s -> 12598.57s]  Look at this bullshit.
[12599.13s -> 12604.28s]  This is such dog shit.
[12606.89s -> 12608.89s]  Dude, go run around the other side.
[12609.45s -> 12610.17s]  Run to the right.
[12610.17s -> 12611.45s]  There's another opening.
[12611.45s -> 12615.35s]  He wants to go in through here.
[12615.35s -> 12616.55s]  See, there he goes.
[12616.55s -> 12617.67s]  He's like, yeah, that's a good idea.
[12617.67s -> 12618.15s]  You're right.
[12624.95s -> 12625.59s]  See?
[12625.59s -> 12626.07s]  There you go.
[12627.21s -> 12629.37s]  You got an opportunity to maybe
[12629.37s -> 12630.49s]  hit the guy right in the back of the head.
[12635.45s -> 12635.77s]  All right.
[12636.41s -> 12636.89s]  Let's do...
[12640.71s -> 12647.59s]  I don't know.
[12647.59s -> 12648.15s]  Ah, shit.
[12648.15s -> 12649.03s]  Didn't do it fast enough.
[12649.59s -> 12661.88s]  Give me some ticks.
[12661.88s -> 12662.12s]  Come on.
[12662.12s -> 12662.84s]  Give me some ticks.
[12663.83s -> 12664.87s]  No ticks?
[12664.87s -> 12669.43s]  Come on, bait him.
[12669.43s -> 12669.83s]  Come on.
[12670.47s -> 12671.83s]  Oh, you dick.
[12671.83s -> 12684.63s]  That was bad.
[12684.63s -> 12687.83s]  Shit.
[12687.83s -> 12689.83s]  I'm backed all the way up here.
[12689.83s -> 12694.26s]  I think somebody's a loot.
[12694.26s -> 12704.73s]  All right.
[12704.73s -> 12706.25s]  Well, let me see if I can sneak up behind one of these.
[12706.25s -> 12706.49s]  No.
[12706.49s -> 12706.89s]  No way.
[12709.18s -> 12711.10s]  Isn't a real safe way to go, huh?
[12711.10s -> 12716.26s]  I guess whoever decides to make the first mistake.
[12720.07s -> 12720.95s]  Like that.
[12720.95s -> 12725.32s]  Oh, fuck.
[12725.32s -> 12726.12s]  Oh, fuck.
[12726.12s -> 12726.92s]  Get him.
[12726.92s -> 12727.24s]  What's this?
[12727.24s -> 12728.12s]  How does this guy in here?
[12729.32s -> 12730.52s]  What the fuck?
[12730.52s -> 12731.64s]  He just climbed in here.
[12745.50s -> 12754.26s]  I can't believe he got up there.
[12754.26s -> 12755.06s]  He climbed all the way up.
[12755.70s -> 12763.98s]  Free guard has won.
[12766.81s -> 12769.21s]  Well, that's just stupid.
[12769.21s -> 12770.01s]  Here we go.
[12770.01s -> 12781.32s]  I'm sorry.
[12781.88s -> 12783.02s]  It's not intentional.
[12790.97s -> 12793.88s]  Did he seriously come all the way back to kill me?
[12793.88s -> 12794.52s]  What the hell?
[12795.08s -> 12800.90s]  He just walked in a straight line and killed me in one hit.
[12808.71s -> 12809.83s]  No, I don't want to be that.
[12810.55s -> 12811.99s]  I'm going back to Raider.
[12815.74s -> 12818.54s]  Hey, I know I was shooting him, but where was all my friends?
[12819.10s -> 12823.10s]  All right, let's get a good cinematic view of this.
[12823.10s -> 12831.59s]  We're following the archer.
[12839.06s -> 12840.42s]  They're not your friends.
[12840.42s -> 12842.36s]  We're fighting for the same thing.
[12843.00s -> 12844.20s]  Our leader wants the crown.
[12845.58s -> 12847.19s]  We're all on the same team.
[12847.19s -> 12849.35s]  We all go to the same ale house together.
[12849.35s -> 12850.47s]  We're not friends, though.
[12850.47s -> 12850.71s]  How?
[12853.54s -> 12857.96s]  There's like 1,500 of us in the whole fucking city.
[12858.52s -> 12859.80s]  You don't think you know everybody here?
[12869.77s -> 12871.13s]  They talk about you behind your back.
[12871.61s -> 12879.29s]  There's a difference between a co-worker and a friend.
[12880.01s -> 12882.23s]  We all probably work on the same farm.
[12884.70s -> 12886.30s]  It's probably the same damn family.
[12891.93s -> 12894.81s]  All these guys came from the same like five people.
[12894.81s -> 12900.60s]  You want to know the history of the universe?
[12901.24s -> 12907.06s]  30 people all had sex with each other.
[12907.06s -> 12911.67s]  And then that's how we got to 10 to 11 billion people.
[12911.67s -> 12923.62s]  It just kept going.
[12923.62s -> 12930.73s]  All right, give me my...
[12930.73s -> 12931.21s]  No, I don't...
[12931.21s -> 12931.93s]  What the hell?
[12931.93s -> 12932.97s]  I picked Raider, didn't I?
[12933.53s -> 12935.30s]  I don't want to do archer again.
[12935.30s -> 12936.18s]  I'm not very good at it.
[12942.81s -> 12944.17s]  Jeremy, I don't know what sex is.
[12944.98s -> 12946.10s]  Someone will tell you eventually.
[12958.10s -> 12959.38s]  Huntsman hallway.
[12960.18s -> 12965.03s]  Can I take out my cleaver?
[12966.23s -> 12967.83s]  Honestly, why?
[12968.39s -> 12973.51s]  I'm starting him mashing the number two and it will not take it out.
[12973.51s -> 12974.79s]  I'm just going two, two, two.
[12974.79s -> 12975.03s]  Don't.
[12975.03s -> 12975.91s]  No, I'm not taking it out.
[12975.91s -> 12977.51s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[12977.51s -> 12977.99s]  Nothing.
[12977.99s -> 12978.15s]  No.
[12979.03s -> 12992.66s]  I don't understand how sex caused 30 people to go to 7 billion.
[12993.74s -> 12997.46s]  Well, 30 people created 80 people.
[12997.46s -> 12998.90s]  80 people created 160.
[12999.06s -> 13000.98s]  160 created 380.
[13000.98s -> 13002.66s]  380 created 5,000.
[13002.66s -> 13003.38s]  5,000...
[13003.38s -> 13005.14s]  Those people were having a lot of sex.
[13005.14s -> 13006.74s]  5,000 created 8,000.
[13007.46s -> 13009.14s]  8,000 created 50,000.
[13009.14s -> 13011.38s]  50,000 created 200,000.
[13011.38s -> 13012.58s]  The plague happened.
[13012.58s -> 13013.62s]  Minus 100,000.
[13013.62s -> 13015.22s]  Those 100,000 then had to make up for it.
[13015.22s -> 13016.10s]  So they made a million.
[13016.74s -> 13021.38s]  Those millions spread across the entire earth and they had a bunch of sex and got it to like a billion.
[13021.38s -> 13024.52s]  And that was about like 80 years ago, 100 years ago.
[13025.16s -> 13028.23s]  That's just how it worked.
[13028.79s -> 13037.75s]  There was only a million people up until like 19, but like 18 fucking 60.
[13038.47s -> 13041.27s]  There was less than like 425,000 people in the world.
[13041.27s -> 13041.59s]  I'm not...
[13041.59s -> 13047.94s]  Okay, I'm going to pay attention because what number of person am I?
[13052.17s -> 13052.81s]  Probably like...
[13052.81s -> 13053.13s]  That's...
[13053.13s -> 13053.45s]  You know what?
[13053.45s -> 13054.57s]  That's what an interesting question.
[13055.21s -> 13058.14s]  That is such an interesting question.
[13058.14s -> 13058.54s]  I'm serious.
[13059.67s -> 13064.23s]  What person are you out of the, you know, 7, 8, 9, but 8 billion, right?
[13066.46s -> 13069.18s]  Like 6 billion, 254 million.
[13069.18s -> 13070.30s]  That's an interesting question.
[13071.34s -> 13081.22s]  Oh God.
[13081.22s -> 13082.18s]  Got you.
[13082.18s -> 13083.22s]  Got you right around the corner.
[13086.78s -> 13087.74s]  Gonna help you.
[13087.74s -> 13088.22s]  Coming in.
[13088.94s -> 13089.50s]  Oh my God.
[13089.50s -> 13089.98s]  There was two.
[13094.87s -> 13095.35s]  No.
[13095.35s -> 13096.44s]  Fuck.
[13096.44s -> 13097.24s]  Oh God.
[13097.24s -> 13098.20s]  I knew they were behind me.
[13099.75s -> 13101.11s]  Oh, they're everywhere.
[13101.11s -> 13104.14s]  Nothing.
[13104.14s -> 13105.02s]  Haven't done anything.
[13109.29s -> 13113.27s]  See, German, you know, you're on the losing team every time.
[13113.27s -> 13118.57s]  It's not, it has nothing to do with the guy holding his sword in his hand in the back
[13120.44s -> 13124.78s]  or the guy hitting him with the giant spoon.
[13126.95s -> 13128.87s]  But it's, it's my fault.
[13128.95s -> 13130.71s]  It's my fault.
[13130.71s -> 13136.01s]  That's the enemy team.
[13140.12s -> 13141.56s]  That's the other team.
[13141.56s -> 13143.96s]  Oh, well, I was on that team before.
[13151.98s -> 13153.26s]  I'm just getting the fuck in there.
[13154.15s -> 13154.63s]  No, I'm not.
[13155.19s -> 13164.81s]  It's so fun.
[13164.81s -> 13165.61s]  Just a whip shit.
[13178.38s -> 13179.58s]  We've got less people over here.
[13186.81s -> 13187.37s]  Oh shit.
[13187.37s -> 13187.77s]  Too many.
[13189.18s -> 13189.90s]  Oh, there's fire.
[13189.90s -> 13190.94s]  Look at all the fire everywhere.
[13192.09s -> 13193.05s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[13193.85s -> 13197.85s]  That's too many.
[13197.85s -> 13201.29s]  It's that they, how do we, how do they get so many back here so quickly?
[13202.01s -> 13206.71s]  It's like, seriously, there's two of them.
[13206.71s -> 13208.31s]  And then they have sex, and then there's fucking eight,
[13208.31s -> 13209.59s]  and then all of a sudden there's fucking 15,
[13209.59s -> 13211.35s]  and then there's 50 just standing around you.
[13220.79s -> 13225.61s]  See, this is, we need you on the front lines.
[13232.31s -> 13233.19s]  You're not going to make it.
[13233.83s -> 13234.87s]  They're not going to make it.
[13234.87s -> 13236.31s]  I can't believe you're making it.
[13237.27s -> 13238.55s]  This should never work.
[13239.77s -> 13243.21s]  The guy with the pole arm has killed I think six people so far.
[13254.47s -> 13255.27s]  Switch teams.
[13258.10s -> 13259.30s]  This game is really fun.
[13259.86s -> 13264.82s]  All you need to win a war is a stick with a pointy end.
[13267.21s -> 13268.17s]  We need a lot of those.
[13269.18s -> 13275.46s]  You need at least two to three hundred thousand of those.
[13275.46s -> 13279.10s]  If we were to talk about a scenario back in the medieval times,
[13280.71s -> 13287.03s]  it was, guys, you remember war back five hundred thousand years ago?
[13287.03s -> 13291.46s]  It was like, it was like maybe 80 people.
[13291.46s -> 13294.18s]  It was like 60 people versus 150 people.
[13298.01s -> 13301.21s]  Maybe there was like, it was like a thousand versus a thousand total.
[13301.21s -> 13306.46s]  There weren't very many people on earth.
[13315.45s -> 13318.01s]  Somebody said, I can't listen to this anymore.
[13318.01s -> 13318.25s]  Bye.
[13319.13s -> 13327.64s]  What's the truth?
[13328.36s -> 13343.10s]  Even people in the Roman age were 50k.
[13343.10s -> 13344.54s]  I know, I'm just fucking around.
[13360.44s -> 13370.63s]  Oh, you guys really don't think I thought that like 200 people fought a war
[13370.63s -> 13371.99s]  back in like the medieval times, right?
[13373.98s -> 13376.94s]  If you do, then I must be a pretty good actor then.
[13377.58s -> 13378.94s]  And I am, so I already know that.
[13381.45s -> 13382.49s]  Damn good fucking actor.
[13402.66s -> 13405.14s]  If you could redo your life again with cheat codes, what would you put on?
[13405.14s -> 13413.06s]  I could like snap my fingers and get a meatball sub.
[13414.97s -> 13415.77s]  That's pretty handy.
[13416.49s -> 13418.62s]  I don't want to fly or any of that bullshit.
[13419.66s -> 13434.94s]  Oh, let's go.
[13434.94s -> 13437.69s]  Let's go back to the, try this guy again.
[13445.80s -> 13447.26s]  Well, I stumbled.
[13461.00s -> 13462.68s]  Oh, who's dead?
[13462.68s -> 13463.40s]  Both.
[13463.40s -> 13470.87s]  And you really, you know, I'm just going to leave you alone
[13470.87s -> 13474.23s]  because you're like, you really want to, you really want to get that done.
[13498.52s -> 13499.80s]  I'm protecting them right now.
[13499.80s -> 13511.64s]  No, I'm getting out of here.
[13511.64s -> 13512.76s]  Watch that over swing.
[13512.76s -> 13524.01s]  Watch that over swing.
[13524.01s -> 13526.01s]  Oh, I thought I was going to get killed by the guy behind him.
[13526.01s -> 13531.03s]  I had a streak going there.
[13531.03s -> 13537.42s]  That wasn't bad.
[13537.42s -> 13539.14s]  What?
[13539.14s -> 13540.70s]  What?
[13540.70s -> 13541.34s]  From behind?
[13542.98s -> 13543.54s]  Hmm.
[13543.54s -> 13545.14s]  I think someone came behind me.
[13554.95s -> 13558.78s]  Oh, he came out of nowhere again.
[13558.78s -> 13560.30s]  Is blocking directional automatic?
[13560.30s -> 13563.91s]  It is not.
[13563.91s -> 13566.79s]  It's right click.
[13566.79s -> 13567.75s]  Really, I just blew it.
[13579.11s -> 13579.67s]  Faked him out.
[13581.05s -> 13583.37s]  Ooh, he's got a little streak going, doesn't he?
[13583.37s -> 13606.10s]  Come on, where am I at?
[13606.10s -> 13606.98s]  14?
[13606.98s -> 13608.18s]  The highest is 24.
[13608.18s -> 13629.56s]  That's not going to happen, I don't think.
[13629.56s -> 13630.52s]  From behind again.
[13630.52s -> 13633.08s]  I got to go back against the wall.
[13633.08s -> 13638.63s]  I just got back to German make this in dreams.
[13640.07s -> 13640.55s]  Yeah.
[13640.55s -> 13656.50s]  I've been behind me, right?
[13656.50s -> 13657.62s]  I tried to fake him out.
[13657.62s -> 13658.50s]  Didn't work.
[13658.50s -> 13663.91s]  Watch out.
[13663.91s -> 13664.47s]  Watch out.
[13664.47s -> 13666.07s]  Always took back against wall.
[13666.07s -> 13681.30s]  Fuck, everyone just keeps coming in.
[13681.30s -> 13684.22s]  It's like the WWF.
[13684.22s -> 13687.02s]  I'm in the ring and the keep interference just keeps happening.
[13687.02s -> 13689.74s]  All right, I'll take top five.
[13689.74s -> 13691.14s]  That's the first time it's happened.
[13698.28s -> 13699.56s]  Only 280 gold.
[13699.56s -> 13701.56s]  I feel like I deserve more than that.
[13701.56s -> 13707.80s]  I kind of just want to keep playing.
[13707.80s -> 13709.48s]  This is, I'm just having a good time.
[13710.04s -> 13724.89s]  I'm going to get to level three.
[13724.89s -> 13727.13s]  Actually fun game in 2019.
[13729.62s -> 13731.62s]  Yeah, it's just kind of fun to play.
[13734.14s -> 13737.02s]  I didn't think I was going to be this entertained by it, but I am.
[13737.58s -> 13739.38s]  Let me try this guy again.
[13741.02s -> 13746.07s]  So this dude is a big heavy evening star.
[13746.71s -> 13749.03s]  So you really want to just try to club people in the head with this.
[13749.67s -> 13752.06s]  What about does it changing?
[13752.06s -> 13752.78s]  I can't change the...
[13753.34s -> 13755.74s]  Okay, I can change it into a...
[13756.30s -> 13757.59s]  I hold it closer.
[13762.20s -> 13764.20s]  So this is, I guess, short range or...
[13764.20s -> 13768.18s]  Let's see what it does.
[13770.84s -> 13772.44s]  Oh, there's so many coming.
[13772.44s -> 13774.06s]  What else do I got?
[13774.06s -> 13774.56s]  Nothing.
[13783.59s -> 13784.55s]  That's too many.
[13785.19s -> 13799.13s]  All right.
[13799.13s -> 13800.09s]  Shit, I thought he was going to...
[13802.47s -> 13803.91s]  Damn, I'm trying to fake him out.
[13805.29s -> 13806.33s]  I'm starting to do that more often.
[13806.33s -> 13807.53s]  That's actually a really good tactic.
[13807.53s -> 13810.49s]  You do the stab and then people try to block it, but then you come over with an overhead.
[13811.29s -> 13815.14s]  It's very, very effective.
[13815.14s -> 13816.02s]  I got to do that more often.
[13817.16s -> 13818.20s]  I'm getting a little better.
[13818.20s -> 13822.79s]  I'm starting to understand mechanics and opportunity and stuff like that.
[13822.79s -> 13823.91s]  And stuff like that.
[13827.80s -> 13828.12s]  All right.
[13828.12s -> 13830.04s]  Well, not when there's this many.
[13830.60s -> 13838.55s]  Come on, give it back, back, back, back.
[13838.55s -> 13847.91s]  I got an assist somehow.
[13849.88s -> 13850.28s]  All right.
[13850.28s -> 13852.20s]  I want to go down here.
[13852.20s -> 13855.32s]  I'm more useful when I can get in like a one-on-one or a one-on-two scenario.
[13856.04s -> 13856.52s]  Like this.
[13863.94s -> 13864.50s]  That.
[13864.50s -> 13865.30s]  Yeah.
[13865.30s -> 13865.70s]  All right.
[13865.70s -> 13866.34s]  Come on, bring it on.
[13867.06s -> 13872.23s]  He blocked all of that somehow.
[13872.95s -> 13875.03s]  This magic shield.
[13878.54s -> 13879.50s]  Look at this guy.
[13879.50s -> 13879.82s]  Wow.
[13898.34s -> 13898.74s]  Damn it.
[13898.74s -> 13899.54s]  I was doing so well.
[13899.54s -> 13900.26s]  Come on.
[13900.26s -> 13904.54s]  I'm still doing all right.
[13904.54s -> 13905.66s]  That was me.
[13905.66s -> 13906.22s]  No, it was me.
[13921.61s -> 13935.74s]  All right, good.
[13935.74s -> 13937.43s]  This guy's trapped in here.
[13939.14s -> 13939.78s]  All right, move up.
[13941.03s -> 13941.99s]  Nice team damage.
[13941.99s -> 13942.39s]  I know.
[13943.11s -> 13944.15s]  I'm trying.
[13944.15s -> 13946.89s]  I'll take a medic bag though.
[13960.52s -> 13961.72s]  Get out of here.
[13961.72s -> 13963.56s]  He's just laughing with all of his...
[13963.56s -> 13964.52s]  Are they even attacking me?
[13965.16s -> 13970.31s]  How do they all get back here?
[13970.79s -> 13996.30s]  Oh, fuck.
[13996.30s -> 13997.02s]  You got...
[13997.02s -> 13998.14s]  You'd be kidding me.
[13998.14s -> 14001.56s]  That dude seriously went around in a full circle.
[14001.56s -> 14022.50s]  I really...
[14022.50s -> 14026.60s]  No.
[14026.60s -> 14027.72s]  He was behind me.
[14027.72s -> 14045.13s]  That's not our horse, right?
[14045.13s -> 14046.41s]  That is enemy horse.
[14047.59s -> 14048.39s]  Dead ahead.
[14048.39s -> 14062.84s]  How did that not hit him?
[14062.84s -> 14071.21s]  Geez.
[14075.93s -> 14076.81s]  We missed.
[14076.81s -> 14083.40s]  Did you really just duck that?
[14089.83s -> 14108.60s]  We've got ourselves a gamer here.
[14108.60s -> 14123.83s]  I didn't do anything.
[14123.83s -> 14125.03s]  I was watching him die.
[14125.03s -> 14130.18s]  Can you please stop blizzing?
[14130.18s -> 14131.54s]  My son is watching.
[14131.54s -> 14133.22s]  Son's not old enough to watch this game.
[14133.22s -> 14135.02s]  I'm sorry.
[14135.02s -> 14135.74s]  He just doesn't...
[14135.74s -> 14154.52s]  Is the game still in development?
[14154.52s -> 14155.24s]  I don't think so.
[14155.96s -> 14157.88s]  I think they're gonna keep adding stuff, right?
[14158.44s -> 14159.72s]  But is it...
[14159.72s -> 14160.68s]  I don't think it's early access.
[14161.56s -> 14163.64s]  Is it?
[14163.64s -> 14165.24s]  My son is 35.
[14165.24s -> 14166.68s]  Well, then that changes everything.
[14178.12s -> 14179.08s]  Onward we go.
[14179.72s -> 14184.94s]  A little chip damage.
[14184.94s -> 14185.90s]  It's all good.
[14185.90s -> 14195.77s]  Don't hurt each other.
[14197.37s -> 14198.81s]  I know it's easier said than done, but...
[14205.90s -> 14206.94s]  Open the door.
[14206.94s -> 14207.50s]  Open the door.
[14208.06s -> 14209.34s]  Open this door right now.
[14209.34s -> 14211.02s]  Can we get an axe guy to break the door open, please?
[14215.80s -> 14216.28s]  Axe.
[14216.28s -> 14217.16s]  Kick door open.
[14217.16s -> 14218.36s]  Somebody open this door.
[14219.48s -> 14220.28s]  Open the door.
[14220.92s -> 14229.62s]  I'll reach in there.
[14229.62s -> 14230.34s]  All right.
[14230.34s -> 14231.06s]  Okay.
[14231.06s -> 14231.86s]  Okay.
[14231.86s -> 14232.98s]  God damn it.
[14235.03s -> 14235.99s]  This was planned.
[14236.63s -> 14238.07s]  This was a planned thing.
[14240.50s -> 14242.10s]  I hope you guys are having fun.
[14250.44s -> 14253.00s]  The old door-stuck guy wraps around trick.
[14253.64s -> 14268.86s]  Stop opening the door.
[14268.86s -> 14269.90s]  My son is in there.
[14272.55s -> 14277.64s]  So we share this castle.
[14277.64s -> 14279.48s]  And his son's like 40.
[14279.48s -> 14286.31s]  In fact, what's he doing here?
[14286.31s -> 14296.86s]  This is my castle.
[14296.86s -> 14297.58s]  Yeah, that's like...
[14297.58s -> 14298.94s]  That's the stables down there.
[14298.94s -> 14300.06s]  He's hanging out in the stables.
[14300.06s -> 14301.10s]  You're not supposed to be down there.
[14301.82s -> 14302.62s]  After four o'clock.
[14302.62s -> 14303.98s]  You know that already.
[14303.98s -> 14308.09s]  We've got some really great shit in the chat room there.
[14308.09s -> 14310.89s]  Somebody said, I actually eat poo-poo pee-pee.
[14311.61s -> 14316.01s]  I'm talking about like top of the line chat box stuff going on in there.
[14317.96s -> 14319.40s]  So, you know, that's great.
[14323.40s -> 14325.08s]  I'm not getting door baited again.
[14325.08s -> 14326.20s]  That's not gonna happen.
[14326.20s -> 14327.08s]  I'm going down here.
[14327.80s -> 14334.01s]  Are you serious?
[14334.01s -> 14335.37s]  Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[14355.26s -> 14356.38s]  Oh, I bled out.
[14363.66s -> 14365.10s]  Jeremy, I think you're projecting.
[14365.74s -> 14372.38s]  There's one person.
[14372.38s -> 14374.62s]  The guy with the pregnant girlfriend
[14374.62s -> 14377.10s]  is the only person on the team that's doing anything.
[14377.82s -> 14378.78s]  Look at the rest of us.
[14379.34s -> 14384.15s]  I guess we're four people.
[14384.15s -> 14390.33s]  I want to see what's going on in here.
[14390.33s -> 14391.85s]  I'm actually, I'm curious.
[14391.85s -> 14392.97s]  Am I banned from going in here?
[14394.25s -> 14395.85s]  Even as a ghost, I can't go in here.
[14412.55s -> 14413.59s]  Yeah, I almost walked into it.
[14414.23s -> 14416.28s]  All right.
[14416.28s -> 14418.04s]  I need to get at least one or two kills.
[14418.04s -> 14418.92s]  I have to.
[14418.92s -> 14419.96s]  I can't just sit at zero.
[14425.45s -> 14426.17s]  Watch the back.
[14426.89s -> 14428.86s]  They like to come around there.
[14429.50s -> 14436.06s]  I can do that too.
[14436.70s -> 14458.92s]  Thank you.
[14458.92s -> 14466.78s]  Didn't get it off first.
[14467.42s -> 14468.46s]  Thought I did.
[14468.46s -> 14474.31s]  Close the door.
[14474.31s -> 14478.70s]  This is bad.
[14478.70s -> 14480.78s]  There's gonna be a reason why we're not supposed to be going up here.
[14480.78s -> 14489.38s]  And there's the reason right there.
[14489.38s -> 14489.78s]  All right.
[14489.78s -> 14490.82s]  Okay, I got him once.
[14492.09s -> 14492.89s]  Easy, easy.
[14492.89s -> 14497.72s]  Don't get piled up here.
[14497.72s -> 14499.08s]  This is gonna be a disaster.
[14504.86s -> 14517.86s]  Watch out behind, behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.
[14517.86s -> 14518.42s]  Oh, God.
[14518.42s -> 14518.74s]  Oh, God.
[14518.74s -> 14519.70s]  We're surrounded.
[14519.70s -> 14525.98s]  You can go.
[14525.98s -> 14526.38s]  Whoa.
[14526.38s -> 14527.58s]  No, no, no, no.
[14527.58s -> 14528.22s]  Oh, that guy.
[14529.18s -> 14539.26s]  Oh, my God.
[14542.10s -> 14542.90s]  Oh, there's too many.
[14550.79s -> 14555.14s]  I couldn't see what was behind me.
[14564.94s -> 14565.50s]  Coward.
[14565.50s -> 14565.98s]  How would you?
[14567.54s -> 14569.22s]  I was trying to be tactical.
[14569.22s -> 14578.07s]  Watch out.
[14578.07s -> 14579.43s]  He's gonna get around us.
[14579.43s -> 14582.52s]  He's dead.
[14582.52s -> 14588.42s]  Didn't hit anybody.
[14588.42s -> 14588.66s]  How?
[14589.66s -> 14593.74s]  Kick him off.
[14593.74s -> 14594.22s]  A bunch of...
[14599.26s -> 14600.30s]  Oh, God, please.
[14603.40s -> 14604.36s]  I just got sniped.
[14604.36s -> 14607.00s]  Not by a stream, but by an arrow.
[14614.17s -> 14617.80s]  Just watching the guy go down.
[14617.80s -> 14619.16s]  I didn't have any health left.
[14619.16s -> 14620.44s]  Of course, I'm gonna die from that.
[14624.07s -> 14624.63s]  Firebat.
[14624.63s -> 14625.59s]  Yeah, it was behind me.
[14625.83s -> 14627.43s]  I had like 15 health left.
[14627.99s -> 14640.12s]  I'm gonna play that.
[14640.12s -> 14641.40s]  Remember when he was getting better?
[14641.40s -> 14642.04s]  Well, look at...
[14642.04s -> 14643.56s]  Okay, look at the team.
[14647.82s -> 14650.70s]  I'm technically in fourth place on the team.
[14653.40s -> 14654.28s]  Technically, that's...
[14654.28s -> 14655.56s]  I'm just giving you facts here.
[14656.28s -> 14673.00s]  Without making it political, pee or poo.
[14673.00s -> 14673.96s]  Both at the same time.
[14674.60s -> 14676.34s]  Does that make you happy?
[14687.22s -> 14687.94s]  What?
[14687.94s -> 14691.94s]  Somebody pushed me into the fucking thing.
[14696.25s -> 14697.85s]  I got wedged in.
[14699.18s -> 14699.98s]  Why?
[14700.78s -> 14701.26s]  No.
[14703.26s -> 14704.46s]  Give me a break.
[14705.72s -> 14706.92s]  Why is that even there?
[14708.20s -> 14711.56s]  There's fucking 40 fucking people in the spawn.
[14713.21s -> 14713.93s]  And somebody...
[14713.93s -> 14714.49s]  Oh, yeah.
[14714.49s -> 14715.85s]  It was just like, sorry to eat, kid.
[14716.33s -> 14717.05s]  Excuse me.
[14717.05s -> 14717.77s]  Get out of my way.
[14717.77s -> 14723.69s]  We were out there.
[14723.69s -> 14725.53s]  I was standing right here and it was like...
[14727.53s -> 14731.58s]  What the fuck?
[14732.14s -> 14733.54s]  Clip it.
[14733.54s -> 14734.34s]  I wanna see it.
[14734.34s -> 14735.06s]  Somebody watch it.
[14735.62s -> 14752.63s]  I think you need to adjust the difficulty.
[14752.63s -> 14754.71s]  Well, now I'm not in fucking fourth place anymore
[14754.71s -> 14755.83s]  because I don't even get to play this one.
[14756.47s -> 14760.74s]  Did the Sonic movie trailer haunt your day?
[14764.63s -> 14767.59s]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they even make that movie.
[14770.22s -> 14773.90s]  Super Mario Brothers even knows to stay the fuck away from film.
[14774.46s -> 14789.51s]  There is a Mario movie.
[14789.51s -> 14793.27s]  Yeah, and it's widely seen as one of the worst movies ever made.
[14796.78s -> 14798.62s]  That shouldn't be a barometer there.
[14798.62s -> 14804.78s]  All right, make sure you don't get pushed.
[14809.30s -> 14809.78s]  Watch this.
[14815.74s -> 14816.54s]  Go ahead, open the door.
[14816.54s -> 14817.66s]  Come on, somebody walk out there.
[14818.38s -> 14820.63s]  Dude, the one time...
[14821.91s -> 14830.20s]  I'm going this way.
[14830.20s -> 14837.83s]  He's dead, right?
[14837.83s -> 14838.23s]  He's dead?
[14838.95s -> 14839.91s]  He better be.
[14839.91s -> 14840.55s]  He's not dead.
[14841.19s -> 14851.90s]  There's so many people right there.
[14851.90s -> 14858.22s]  Are we really doing this again?
[14858.22s -> 14868.50s]  Watch this right side.
[14868.50s -> 14876.15s]  They're retreating.
[14876.15s -> 14883.91s]  That means they don't have much health.
[14883.91s -> 14889.11s]  Again.
[14889.11s -> 14889.51s]  Nice.
[14889.51s -> 14897.10s]  Good work.
[14897.10s -> 14897.82s]  See you.
[14897.82s -> 14899.66s]  Okay, good.
[14899.66s -> 14900.46s]  Who's left?
[14900.46s -> 14909.11s]  That is not a good battle cry.
[14909.11s -> 14911.37s]  See, look, I've climbed all the way back up.
[14916.60s -> 14917.96s]  17 kills.
[14920.82s -> 14921.54s]  Don't fall down.
[14922.95s -> 14923.19s]  See?
[14923.19s -> 14923.83s]  He almost just did.
[14923.83s -> 14924.07s]  See?
[14924.07s -> 14925.13s]  He did.
[14925.13s -> 14926.07s]  Look.
[14926.07s -> 14928.17s]  He did.
[14928.17s -> 14932.07s]  He fell all the way down.
[14932.07s -> 14932.63s]  He did.
[14932.63s -> 14952.60s]  I don't want to do that.
[14952.60s -> 14955.59s]  How am I hitting a teammate there?
[14955.59s -> 14961.08s]  Well, now you got to get down.
[14963.24s -> 14963.88s]  Fuck.
[14963.88s -> 14965.53s]  No!
[14966.33s -> 14968.01s]  What the hell was I doing?
[14971.86s -> 14973.46s]  No!
[14973.46s -> 14975.83s]  Why did I do that?
[14975.83s -> 14979.51s]  I got a kill for it, but I lit like two of my teammates on fire.
[14979.51s -> 14980.23s]  Fuck.
[14980.23s -> 14992.02s]  The person that made the Minions movie is making a Mario movie.
[14995.96s -> 14997.56s]  It's hard to do a Mario movie though,
[14999.86s -> 15003.62s]  because just by its very nature, Mario doesn't talk.
[15003.62s -> 15004.86s]  I know he did.
[15004.86s -> 15007.50s]  I know there was the Mario Super Show and all that shit,
[15007.50s -> 15010.06s]  but if it's a cartoon, like 3D animation,
[15010.86s -> 15011.90s]  Mario doesn't really talk.
[15016.17s -> 15019.85s]  Is it just going to be Mario is no dialogue?
[15022.62s -> 15024.62s]  Yeah, a Mario movie is way harder than a Sonic movie,
[15024.62s -> 15025.90s]  because Sonic never shuts the fuck up.
[15029.94s -> 15033.38s]  Half of Sonic the Hedgehog's appeal is he talks really loudly,
[15034.38s -> 15035.50s]  and all the time.
[15036.79s -> 15040.26s]  So Mario doesn't really do that.
[15040.26s -> 15042.10s]  I mean, maybe Luigi, but Luigi,
[15042.10s -> 15043.62s]  they've made the characters over the years
[15045.13s -> 15046.65s]  very, very simple language,
[15047.99s -> 15049.27s]  really easy to understand.
[15049.27s -> 15053.35s]  You know, like, oh, oh, bingo, right?
[15053.35s -> 15054.47s]  How do you make a whole movie of that?
[15057.99s -> 15060.23s]  Their dialogue is all in Mario Kart.
[15060.23s -> 15066.90s]  I'm dead.
[15066.90s -> 15080.82s]  Now I want to play with here.
[15080.82s -> 15083.38s]  I need to get some more items and armor and shit.
[15086.84s -> 15087.72s]  They did Minions.
[15087.72s -> 15090.33s]  Yeah, but are the Minions?
[15092.54s -> 15093.98s]  I mean, I never seen the movie or anything,
[15093.98s -> 15097.40s]  but do the, I don't think I've even played once with Knight.
[15098.04s -> 15100.97s]  Aren't there other people that are in those movies
[15100.97s -> 15103.37s]  that talk for the Minions essentially?
[15103.37s -> 15105.05s]  They're the ones that are there
[15105.05s -> 15107.77s]  to kind of experience the world with you in a way?
[15110.47s -> 15111.43s]  Or do the Minions just,
[15111.99s -> 15113.99s]  it's just absolutely can't understand anything?
[15118.34s -> 15119.06s]  Peach can talk.
[15119.06s -> 15120.50s]  Yeah, I mean, but you need a character
[15120.50s -> 15122.58s]  that is going to have most of the dialogue,
[15124.02s -> 15125.62s]  unless they're really going to make Mario
[15128.23s -> 15131.03s]  fully voice acted dialogue.
[15131.03s -> 15133.27s]  I mean, Taro's Martinet, right?
[15133.27s -> 15134.15s]  He's still doing it.
[15134.15s -> 15135.11s]  Is he still doing it?
[15141.18s -> 15142.30s]  I wonder if he would just do it.
[15142.86s -> 15150.60s]  You see, he was doing it for a very, very long time.
[15157.75s -> 15160.23s]  Fully voice acted Wario in the last WarioWare game.
[15160.95s -> 15162.23s]  I'm all for it.
[15162.23s -> 15163.59s]  I'm all for the attempt, right?
[15169.42s -> 15172.78s]  But having a protagonist that doesn't really speak.
[15172.78s -> 15173.74s]  That was beautiful.
[15173.74s -> 15174.78s]  Hit him in the face with a hammer.
[15175.42s -> 15178.46s]  He's going to get away with that.
[15181.91s -> 15184.39s]  Just one blacksmith versus an army.
[15184.95s -> 15193.32s]  He has a voice actor.
[15193.32s -> 15194.84s]  Yeah, but he doesn't really,
[15196.55s -> 15199.59s]  Mario doesn't have a fully scripted dialogue.
[15199.59s -> 15200.55s]  He has phrases.
[15201.19s -> 15210.70s]  I'm going to put a bear trap down right here,
[15211.26s -> 15212.73s]  right at the top of the stairs.
[15227.98s -> 15228.48s]  Die!
[15228.94s -> 15232.09s]  Did he not die?
[15232.09s -> 15233.13s]  I'm surprised by that.
[15233.77s -> 15238.26s]  He did die.
[15238.26s -> 15240.34s]  He fell for a very, very, very long time.
[15248.73s -> 15249.69s]  Did he not die?
[15249.69s -> 15250.33s]  No, he did.
[15260.06s -> 15260.78s]  You used the loot?
[15263.00s -> 15264.76s]  I'm so useless with this character.
[15264.76s -> 15265.48s]  In a little bit.
[15265.48s -> 15265.98s]  Not right now.
[15266.68s -> 15272.60s]  Oh, somebody went in the bear trap.
[15272.60s -> 15274.20s]  Okay, that makes more sense, doesn't it?
[15283.67s -> 15285.75s]  Let me show the action, Jeremy.
[15285.75s -> 15286.25s]  Come on.
[15300.22s -> 15301.42s]  You the last one standing?
[15302.55s -> 15304.07s]  I think there are two red archers left.
[15311.05s -> 15311.61s]  Scary.
[15317.90s -> 15318.70s]  Almost.
[15318.70s -> 15319.90s]  Very close.
[15319.90s -> 15324.22s]  Is he dropping them from above?
[15326.74s -> 15328.39s]  Bear trap.
[15328.39s -> 15329.51s]  Not cool.
[15329.51s -> 15330.47s]  Not cool.
[15330.47s -> 15342.70s]  Oh, well.
[15342.70s -> 15348.94s]  We tried.
[15348.94s -> 15349.50s]  All right.
[15349.50s -> 15350.14s]  I'm a knight.
[15352.28s -> 15353.48s]  I've never played as the knight.
[15356.71s -> 15358.39s]  Let me string together two and three.
[15358.39s -> 15359.03s]  I just want two.
[15359.67s -> 15360.71s]  Two per round is good.
[15361.27s -> 15363.94s]  If it's even possible, it is.
[15363.94s -> 15365.94s]  But I don't like this map with this many people.
[15366.58s -> 15378.39s]  I blocked it.
[15378.39s -> 15387.51s]  Right in the head.
[15387.51s -> 15388.39s]  Keep that.
[15388.39s -> 15389.59s]  A guy needs one hit and he's dead.
[15391.24s -> 15391.96s]  We got more than them.
[15391.96s -> 15392.44s]  We got more.
[15392.44s -> 15392.84s]  Go in.
[15392.84s -> 15393.88s]  Go, go, go, go in.
[15393.88s -> 15394.28s]  Let's go.
[15409.46s -> 15410.18s]  No, no, no, no.
[15410.18s -> 15410.90s]  I'm in the fighting area.
[15410.90s -> 15411.70s]  What are you talking about?
[15411.70s -> 15422.94s]  Oh, fuck.
[15422.94s -> 15423.42s]  Oh, fuck.
[15423.42s -> 15430.14s]  No.
[15430.14s -> 15430.70s]  What?
[15430.70s -> 15431.80s]  That was...
[15431.80s -> 15433.45s]  This is bad.
[15433.45s -> 15441.50s]  I'm in trouble.
[15442.30s -> 15445.30s]  Oh, well.
[15445.30s -> 15448.98s]  They're gonna vote kick me?
[15448.98s -> 15451.94s]  Well, then they don't get to play anymore.
[15451.94s -> 15453.59s]  Because I'll go to a different server.
[15453.59s -> 15454.63s]  It's that simple.
[15454.63s -> 15468.26s]  The vote kick is real.
[15468.26s -> 15479.91s]  They can play without you.
[15479.91s -> 15484.22s]  You don't think they're gonna do that, do you?
[15484.22s -> 15485.50s]  Do you really believe that?
[15485.50s -> 15503.40s]  Do you really think
[15503.40s -> 15507.51s]  the guy that taunts every time
[15507.51s -> 15509.59s]  and runs through everybody to come find me
[15509.59s -> 15514.20s]  is gonna play a different server?
[15514.20s -> 15515.00s]  Hey, don't fall.
[15531.67s -> 15533.11s]  Do you really think that?
[15533.11s -> 15550.94s]  Oh, this is a bad place to be.
[15550.94s -> 15551.74s]  I don't want to be here.
[15551.74s -> 15567.82s]  Uh-oh.
[15567.82s -> 15568.54s]  Too many.
[15568.54s -> 15572.17s]  Oh, fuck.
[15572.17s -> 15572.65s]  Too many.
[15572.65s -> 15572.89s]  No.
[15573.53s -> 15599.05s]  Are they playing door pong?
[15599.05s -> 15604.63s]  Let's see how this ends.
[15604.63s -> 15611.21s]  How is this gonna end?
[15611.21s -> 15613.69s]  It ends with the squire killing both of them.
[15613.69s -> 15617.51s]  Watch.
[15617.51s -> 15618.15s]  Oops.
[15618.15s -> 15621.98s]  I don't even know what that was.
[15627.10s -> 15630.76s]  This game is fucking ridiculous.
[15637.85s -> 15638.57s]  That was, uh...
[15640.70s -> 15641.58s]  Oh, Sir Davos.
[15642.14s -> 15643.42s]  I'm not much of a fighter.
[15643.42s -> 15645.10s]  Apologize for what you're about to see.
[15645.74s -> 15652.22s]  You know, the Red Woman.
[15652.22s -> 15653.34s]  Get him, Davos.
[15653.34s -> 15667.50s]  Does Jerma only read your messages out loud if you insult him?
[15667.50s -> 15668.14s]  Yes.
[15668.14s -> 15672.70s]  Look at all that.
[15672.70s -> 15675.82s]  That team had like 40 combined stream sniper kills on me.
[15675.82s -> 15677.18s]  They were only killing me.
[15677.18s -> 15678.78s]  I was the only person to die.
[15678.78s -> 15680.62s]  Notice everybody on my team had zero deaths
[15680.62s -> 15681.90s]  and I had 48 deaths.
[15682.46s -> 15683.34s]  That's unfair.
[15683.34s -> 15684.14s]  It shouldn't be like that.
[15691.19s -> 15692.15s]  I need to level up.
[15692.15s -> 15693.03s]  Why am I not getting any...
[15693.35s -> 15694.71s]  Did XP turn off again?
[15703.61s -> 15705.13s]  Jerma, you are a badass.
[15705.13s -> 15706.01s]  Hey, thanks.
[15706.01s -> 15706.97s]  That wasn't a mean comment.
[15706.97s -> 15708.09s]  I read it all up.
[15708.09s -> 15712.90s]  Try getting more kills than deaths.
[15713.62s -> 15716.66s]  I have like 12 kills and 48 deaths.
[15717.38s -> 15730.79s]  This is so much fun, though.
[15730.79s -> 15731.35s]  It really is.
[15731.91s -> 15736.55s]  I'm just gonna pretend that I'm Ned Stark and it's just ice.
[15748.81s -> 15749.69s]  Oops.
[15749.69s -> 15751.34s]  I thought I was still on the...
[15751.34s -> 15752.14s]  Okay.
[15752.14s -> 15753.10s]  Well, Ned Stark did...
[15753.82s -> 15757.27s]  I made him...
[15757.35s -> 15765.51s]  I thought my last game was...
[15770.30s -> 15771.42s]  Died immediately.
[15772.22s -> 15790.06s]  Damn it.
[15790.06s -> 15791.02s]  I thought I was gonna faster.
[15801.08s -> 15802.76s]  Yeah, he wouldn't have been in the show for very long.
[15821.40s -> 15822.36s]  Somebody kill him.
[15842.20s -> 15843.40s]  God damn it.
[15843.40s -> 15853.70s]  Is somebody behind?
[15853.70s -> 15858.14s]  Oh, can you guess who that was?
[15858.14s -> 15861.56s]  I wonder how many of my deaths have been to that guy.
[15861.56s -> 15863.96s]  It's got to be at least like 30.
[15863.96s -> 15883.42s]  I'm going over here.
[15883.42s -> 15883.74s]  Kill!
[15884.38s -> 15890.36s]  Give me that.
[15890.36s -> 15906.98s]  An archer.
[15906.98s -> 15910.04s]  Can I pull the arrow out?
[15910.04s -> 15910.68s]  I can.
[15910.68s -> 15918.34s]  Uh-oh.
[15918.34s -> 15929.10s]  Guy on a horse.
[15929.10s -> 15929.42s]  Whoa!
[15938.84s -> 15940.28s]  No, I'm reconnected.
[15940.28s -> 15941.70s]  I think I'm back.
[15941.70s -> 15950.06s]  What's my favorite movie?
[15950.06s -> 15950.70s]  That's a tough one.
[15950.70s -> 15952.30s]  Ghostbusters or Gremlins 2.
[15952.30s -> 15956.44s]  That's a toss-up, though.
[15956.44s -> 15956.84s]  It's hard.
[15974.04s -> 15974.52s]  Nice.
[15974.52s -> 15974.84s]  Good.
[15974.84s -> 15986.39s]  Keep it going.
[15986.39s -> 15987.03s]  Holy shit!
[15988.09s -> 15988.65s]  Whoa!
[15988.65s -> 15989.37s]  Too many people.
[15990.01s -> 15990.89s]  Oh.
[15990.89s -> 15996.14s]  It's Back to the Future.
[15996.14s -> 15997.18s]  That's a good one, too.
[15997.18s -> 16000.26s]  There's a lot of good movies.
[16000.26s -> 16019.69s]  There really are.
[16019.69s -> 16020.33s]  Fuck.
[16020.33s -> 16031.42s]  Everyone's fighting this like pen over here.
[16031.90s -> 16042.26s]  Horizontal strike.
[16042.26s -> 16042.82s]  Right in the...
[16042.82s -> 16043.30s]  Never mind.
[16047.37s -> 16048.17s]  Aw.
[16048.17s -> 16055.26s]  Kill the archers.
[16055.26s -> 16055.66s]  That's a good...
[16055.66s -> 16056.70s]  You know, I'm going to run around.
[16056.70s -> 16059.88s]  I'll try to wrap it up and kill all archers.
[16059.88s -> 16064.38s]  I'll be on archer duty.
[16064.38s -> 16080.15s]  There's an archer!
[16080.15s -> 16082.57s]  We lost?
[16082.57s -> 16084.30s]  That's sad.
[16084.30s -> 16094.25s]  I'll kill the people that can't fight back.
[16094.25s -> 16094.81s]  What do you mean?
[16094.81s -> 16101.40s]  They've been fighting the whole time, shooting arrows at me.
[16101.40s -> 16101.88s]  Experience.
[16101.88s -> 16102.44s]  Come on, more.
[16105.03s -> 16105.83s]  No.
[16105.83s -> 16108.68s]  Why does it have to be shut off?
[16108.68s -> 16108.92s]  All right.
[16108.92s -> 16110.20s]  I'm going to take a look at what I got.
[16110.20s -> 16111.08s]  Because I have money.
[16111.08s -> 16112.36s]  Let me go see what I have here.
[16112.36s -> 16116.82s]  I should be like eight or something by now.
[16116.82s -> 16125.53s]  Let's go down here.
[16125.53s -> 16126.65s]  How much money do I have?
[16128.34s -> 16129.54s]  Why am I not making any money?
[16133.24s -> 16135.64s]  I have not gotten any experience points and no money.
[16135.64s -> 16137.56s]  But did they turn it on and then turn it off again?
[16138.12s -> 16142.79s]  Because it was working for about 15 minutes.
[16143.59s -> 16144.07s]  Damn it.
[16144.07s -> 16144.47s]  Oh well.
[16145.11s -> 16147.38s]  All right.
[16147.38s -> 16148.58s]  Let's go somewhere else.
[16148.58s -> 16153.82s]  Play the tutorial for cash.
[16154.62s -> 16157.58s]  I tried that last time, but I'm assuming it's not going to work again.
[16158.14s -> 16162.26s]  Because the servers are not keeping up with what you're doing.
[16162.26s -> 16163.14s]  It probably won't work.
[16163.86s -> 16165.56s]  So no, it's all good.
[16166.20s -> 16167.34s]  We'll just join another one.
[16168.06s -> 16169.19s]  All right.
[16169.19s -> 16170.95s]  Something a little more low scale.
[16174.68s -> 16175.08s]  Like this.
[16176.20s -> 16176.52s]  Never mind.
[16176.52s -> 16178.12s]  This is called very horrible place.
[16178.12s -> 16179.00s]  I don't think I want to do that.
[16180.17s -> 16180.81s]  Team deathmatch.
[16180.81s -> 16181.61s]  Here we go.
[16181.61s -> 16193.02s]  Let's go try the night again.
[16197.53s -> 16201.13s]  Real gamers don't care about cosmetics or currency.
[16201.93s -> 16206.73s]  Well, you have to when it involves buying new weapons
[16206.73s -> 16208.09s]  that you can use in the game.
[16208.81s -> 16213.16s]  What are you going to do?
[16213.16s -> 16214.36s]  What are you going to do?
[16214.36s -> 16215.24s]  Punch me?
[16215.24s -> 16216.12s]  You're going to TK me?
[16221.46s -> 16222.26s]  All right.
[16222.26s -> 16222.74s]  Let's go.
[16235.90s -> 16238.06s]  I don't even know how the fuck I wrapped around you like this.
[16240.50s -> 16240.82s]  Kill.
[16241.38s -> 16243.18s]  Is it bleeding?
[16248.50s -> 16249.46s]  Uh, okay.
[16258.90s -> 16259.70s]  Delete OBS.
[16262.47s -> 16263.27s]  All right.
[16263.27s -> 16275.00s]  I'll show up behind you.
[16277.21s -> 16279.53s]  That was what I would consider a bop.
[16287.13s -> 16287.45s]  What?
[16289.26s -> 16289.98s]  What happened?
[16289.98s -> 16292.22s]  Did I jump directly into them?
[16292.86s -> 16294.41s]  That's the...
[16294.41s -> 16294.65s]  Okay.
[16294.65s -> 16296.97s]  I've been playing this game for almost four and a half hours.
[16298.28s -> 16303.51s]  And I've touched those spikes before and it didn't instantly kill me.
[16310.78s -> 16325.45s]  Uh-oh.
[16325.45s -> 16327.69s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16329.13s -> 16334.28s]  I jumped face-first into them.
[16334.28s -> 16336.92s]  I thought they were just kind of there to be an annoyance.
[16336.92s -> 16339.64s]  I didn't know that you died if you touched them instantly.
[16339.64s -> 16342.55s]  It's the first time I've seen them work.
[16350.23s -> 16351.03s]  You killed them.
[16351.03s -> 16352.68s]  All right.
[16352.68s -> 16353.40s]  I'm going.
[16353.40s -> 16354.52s]  The bridge is just death.
[16354.52s -> 16355.72s]  They're all piled up on the bridge.
[16367.61s -> 16370.42s]  Was there anybody even around?
[16370.98s -> 16372.92s]  What the fuck?
[16372.92s -> 16378.63s]  I guess I've been behind me.
[16379.19s -> 16384.68s]  You're going down.
[16385.24s -> 16395.34s]  Through the hole.
[16395.34s -> 16395.74s]  Come on.
[16398.76s -> 16399.32s]  Right in the head.
[16400.04s -> 16400.76s]  I can't get that.
[16401.32s -> 16411.50s]  Get his loot.
[16424.70s -> 16425.58s]  Stab.
[16425.58s -> 16426.38s]  There it is.
[16426.38s -> 16426.86s]  All right.
[16426.86s -> 16443.24s]  Keep it up.
[16443.24s -> 16443.80s]  Rock.
[16443.80s -> 16458.22s]  Didn't think I was going to turn, did you?
[16458.22s -> 16459.02s]  Nice.
[16459.02s -> 16470.71s]  That guy dead?
[16470.71s -> 16471.27s]  Not yet.
[16475.98s -> 16476.62s]  Oh, great.
[16477.56s -> 16480.12s]  Well, oh well.
[16480.12s -> 16482.20s]  That was good spicy team attacks.
[16482.20s -> 16482.84s]  They were pretty good.
[16487.42s -> 16493.94s]  That guy looks like the ref.
[16493.94s -> 16494.66s]  I wonder if they...
[16494.66s -> 16501.62s]  Imagine if they had refs back then.
[16501.62s -> 16501.94s]  All right.
[16501.94s -> 16502.82s]  Don't touch those.
[16502.82s -> 16503.22s]  They're bad.
[16506.26s -> 16508.02s]  They did have a ref back then.
[16508.02s -> 16509.90s]  No, they didn't.
[16509.90s -> 16520.87s]  All right.
[16520.87s -> 16523.05s]  I got thrown the shit at me.
[16523.05s -> 16523.61s]  It's got to go.
[16524.17s -> 16530.04s]  I'm going to drop down.
[16530.04s -> 16530.92s]  I know it.
[16530.92s -> 16537.72s]  What do I have left?
[16537.72s -> 16544.84s]  One, two, three.
[16545.64s -> 16549.43s]  Well, that was dumb.
[16549.99s -> 16551.03s]  I didn't even click.
[16551.03s -> 16551.75s]  I didn't even click.
[16551.75s -> 16551.99s]  I swear.
[16551.99s -> 16552.71s]  I promise you.
[16552.71s -> 16553.67s]  I didn't click.
[16553.67s -> 16570.22s]  The guy with the fucking frying pan.
[16577.94s -> 16581.46s]  It's only so many times I can block the fucking attacks.
[16581.46s -> 16591.02s]  I got looted.
[16591.02s -> 16591.82s]  I did.
[16591.82s -> 16598.68s]  Oh, that guy got in the way.
[16598.68s -> 16608.94s]  This guy is fucking relentless.
[16608.94s -> 16624.89s]  Somebody behind me, right?
[16624.89s -> 16625.45s]  Goodbye.
[16626.17s -> 16628.84s]  He didn't see me in his peripheral.
[16628.84s -> 16649.69s]  But I did.
[16649.69s -> 16650.97s]  Oh, good.
[16651.53s -> 16652.17s]  Very good.
[16653.48s -> 16654.36s]  MVP.
[16654.36s -> 16669.94s]  Took his legs out.
[16669.94s -> 16670.98s]  Good work.
[16670.98s -> 16673.10s]  This is working like a team.
[16673.10s -> 16674.06s]  This is what it should look like.
[16681.75s -> 16681.99s]  No.
[16682.95s -> 16688.90s]  I'm going to bed now.
[16688.90s -> 16690.02s]  Can I get a good night beer?
[16697.90s -> 16707.83s]  I was going to do it right into the microphone,
[16707.83s -> 16708.95s]  but it's getting later.
[16708.95s -> 16709.59s]  I don't want to do that.
[16713.11s -> 16723.34s]  The referee got too close to the combat.
[16723.34s -> 16723.98s]  Watch it.
[16723.98s -> 16724.62s]  He's going.
[16724.62s -> 16726.06s]  I knew you were going to do that.
[16726.06s -> 16728.54s]  Is this going to be my first battle?
[16748.17s -> 16748.73s]  No.
[16748.73s -> 16749.45s]  Friend.
[16749.45s -> 16751.72s]  An annoying friend.
[16752.54s -> 16753.02s]  I'm dead.
[16760.62s -> 16761.58s]  Friendly friend.
[16761.58s -> 16763.50s]  Did I tap the button?
[16763.50s -> 16775.14s]  I think in my repost, isn't that what I'm doing?
[16777.72s -> 16779.24s]  It's like right after you swing, right?
[16779.24s -> 16779.80s]  After you block.
[16781.64s -> 16782.04s]  Like that.
[16782.68s -> 16783.80s]  I think I've been doing that.
[16784.44s -> 16799.83s]  He even tried turning the...
[16799.83s -> 16801.83s]  Yeah, but it's kind of...
[16801.83s -> 16803.43s]  My brain just wants to kill things.
[16804.07s -> 16812.23s]  No, I thought he wasn't going to pay attention to that.
[16812.87s -> 16823.16s]  Come on in.
[16823.16s -> 16824.68s]  Oh, he's got the bow, doesn't he?
[16826.33s -> 16826.81s]  See ya.
[16830.06s -> 16830.78s]  Damn it.
[16830.78s -> 16831.77s]  Get the ref.
[16841.45s -> 16841.85s]  I missed.
[16843.11s -> 16844.15s]  Wow.
[16844.15s -> 16845.19s]  What did I hit him with?
[16845.83s -> 16847.88s]  I didn't hit him in the back of the head?
[16848.52s -> 16849.50s]  That was interesting.
[16856.54s -> 16857.66s]  Eventually we're going to have a fight.
[16888.98s -> 16889.30s]  No!
[16889.94s -> 16892.76s]  Oh, die!
[16893.64s -> 16904.66s]  I can't have 13, that's unlucky.
[16904.66s -> 16905.54s]  Seven minutes left.
[16913.54s -> 16914.50s]  In the fire.
[16914.50s -> 16926.89s]  I didn't get him.
[16926.89s -> 16930.54s]  Watch out behind.
[16939.90s -> 16943.11s]  The combo.
[16943.11s -> 16952.04s]  Nice cross.
[16952.04s -> 16953.24s]  Holy shit.
[16953.24s -> 16954.28s]  Oh, I think I...
[16954.28s -> 16955.86s]  Damn it.
[16955.86s -> 16957.06s]  Come on, I can't have 13 kills.
[16957.06s -> 16958.58s]  14 at least, or 15.
[16958.58s -> 16961.83s]  Is this game out?
[16961.83s -> 16963.19s]  No, oh yeah.
[16963.19s -> 16964.23s]  You can buy it right now.
[16964.23s -> 16965.62s]  Should be on the front page.
[16977.13s -> 16978.33s]  Hey, we did it!
[16978.33s -> 16982.09s]  I'm not on the losing team this time.
[16982.09s -> 16985.53s]  Yeah, as of right now the game is released, but it's kind of broken.
[16985.53s -> 16987.85s]  Progression is turned off.
[16987.85s -> 16991.56s]  The currency is turned off.
[16991.56s -> 16992.36s]  The game works.
[16992.36s -> 16993.88s]  Some of the servers have issues.
[17000.82s -> 17001.46s]  Damn it.
[17001.46s -> 17004.70s]  Re-turn it back on.
[17004.70s -> 17005.58s]  Turn it off, turn it on.
[17005.58s -> 17006.38s]  Will that work?
[17006.38s -> 17014.39s]  The game itself is a blast.
[17014.39s -> 17015.43s]  Oh yeah, no, it's awesome.
[17018.28s -> 17020.84s]  I wouldn't be playing it for this long if I didn't think it was great.
[17020.84s -> 17022.04s]  I've been playing for like five hours.
[17022.04s -> 17023.08s]  I think it's fantastic.
[17023.08s -> 17026.04s]  Who do I want to be?
[17044.46s -> 17045.18s]  I don't know.
[17045.18s -> 17053.67s]  All right, let's go.
[17053.67s -> 17057.98s]  The protector of the realm.
[17057.98s -> 17069.05s]  Is it behind me hitting me?
[17069.05s -> 17073.00s]  Fuck!
[17073.00s -> 17073.96s]  Too many.
[17073.96s -> 17074.52s]  There's a lot.
[17075.24s -> 17079.67s]  No, no way.
[17079.67s -> 17080.63s]  Too many.
[17081.27s -> 17086.20s]  Oh, this is not...
[17086.20s -> 17088.68s]  Okay, this is just spawning and I keep going.
[17088.68s -> 17092.70s]  It's right ahead.
[17098.95s -> 17100.79s]  Damn, they're like all the way back at our spawn.
[17100.79s -> 17106.49s]  Let's try the spear.
[17108.01s -> 17109.53s]  Actually try to use it this time.
[17109.53s -> 17117.32s]  Fuckin' hell.
[17127.86s -> 17132.70s]  Oh, this is bad.
[17132.70s -> 17133.90s]  I got a long weapon, man.
[17133.90s -> 17135.18s]  I could stay up here for a while.
[17141.46s -> 17150.78s]  God damn it.
[17150.78s -> 17151.74s]  Let's not do this.
[17177.19s -> 17182.34s]  Oh, we're getting so badly smoked right now.
[17182.34s -> 17196.01s]  Where'd you come from?
[17196.01s -> 17198.26s]  All right, I gotta be somebody else.
[17198.34s -> 17200.02s]  We just can't even leave our spawn.
[17200.02s -> 17212.79s]  Come here.
[17212.79s -> 17224.66s]  Damn it.
[17224.66s -> 17225.78s]  Leave me alone.
[17235.75s -> 17241.78s]  Nobody on my team has more than three kills.
[17241.78s -> 17251.08s]  Kicking is good,
[17251.08s -> 17253.56s]  but when there's three or four people around you,
[17253.56s -> 17255.27s]  you can't really do it.
[17255.27s -> 17276.09s]  No.
[17276.09s -> 17276.57s]  Damn it.
[17303.03s -> 17304.31s]  I made you two.
[17304.31s -> 17330.62s]  There's no fighting them.
[17330.62s -> 17346.78s]  Finally, one like ant came out too far out of the nest.
[17346.78s -> 17347.58s]  We got him.
[17347.58s -> 17372.04s]  Our like shitty ant colony finally killed one ant.
[17372.76s -> 17380.34s]  Laugh at that.
[17380.34s -> 17382.10s]  You son of a bitch.
[17383.43s -> 17384.55s]  I got him.
[17384.55s -> 17400.28s]  Oops, I'm sorry.
[17400.28s -> 17401.16s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[17401.16s -> 17401.88s]  I was trying to click.
[17401.88s -> 17402.28s]  I'm sorry.
[17402.28s -> 17403.48s]  I didn't mean to.
[17403.48s -> 17412.54s]  I'm trying to do it again.
[17413.10s -> 17415.26s]  I'm trying to kick that fucking guy up again.
[17431.77s -> 17441.83s]  Do you ever press X then two?
[17449.46s -> 17450.74s]  Why is that a thing?
[17451.54s -> 17451.86s]  What?
[17452.92s -> 17455.16s]  I accidentally hit my own buddy in the face.
[17482.17s -> 17483.05s]  Oh my god.
[17490.65s -> 17492.09s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[17509.30s -> 17510.10s]  Kill.
[17510.10s -> 17510.42s]  Kill.
[17512.26s -> 17513.22s]  Oh, hello, sir.
[17525.82s -> 17527.30s]  Zero health.
[17527.30s -> 17528.02s]  Almost.
[17528.02s -> 17537.78s]  I'm just getting fucking destroyed.
[17537.78s -> 17539.62s]  I want to kick more people off the edge.
[17539.62s -> 17539.94s]  No.
[17540.66s -> 17548.82s]  I got it.
[17548.82s -> 17549.38s]  Plus one.
[17549.94s -> 17550.98s]  One damage.
[17550.98s -> 17580.02s]  It took like five people.
[17580.02s -> 17580.74s]  What the fuck?
[17580.74s -> 17581.70s]  Oh my god, my...
[17581.70s -> 17582.66s]  Oh my god.
[17582.66s -> 17583.70s]  Oh my god, what do I do?
[17583.70s -> 17596.92s]  All right.
[17596.92s -> 17597.88s]  I want to try...
[17597.88s -> 17602.07s]  I want to try the actual VR again.
[17602.07s -> 17603.59s]  I want to see if I can actually do it.
[17603.59s -> 17604.39s]  Is it...
[17604.39s -> 17605.43s]  Can we do it?
[17605.43s -> 17626.58s]  This is where it begins.
[17629.03s -> 17629.67s]  I gotta pee too.
[17629.67s -> 17640.92s]  I haven't peed once today, have I?
[17640.92s -> 17641.56s]  No, I haven't.
[17653.18s -> 17654.22s]  That's a first.
[17654.22s -> 17656.30s]  I don't think I've done that in a long time.
[17656.30s -> 17665.93s]  It's been a while since I've not had to pee for like five hours.
[17665.93s -> 17668.25s]  I did pee right before the stream started though.
[17668.25s -> 17672.10s]  Should I go pee right now?
[17672.10s -> 17672.90s]  Okay, I'm gonna go pee...
[17672.90s -> 17674.02s]  I'm gonna go as fast as I can.
[17674.66s -> 17676.57s]  I'm gonna get some water.
[17676.57s -> 17677.45s]  I'll be right back.
[17678.34s -> 17684.39s]  Hopefully by the time I get back in here, we'll see.
[17685.11s -> 17687.86s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[17688.50s -> 17688.98s]  Okay, bye.
[17689.54s -> 17862.20s]  Did I get in?
[17862.20s -> 17867.72s]  No, I'm still looking.
[17870.10s -> 17871.30s]  Oh, really?
[17875.50s -> 17876.22s]  This would be fun.
[17876.86s -> 17881.27s]  Quick drawing does not work.
[17882.30s -> 17882.78s]  Oh.
[17882.78s -> 17884.68s]  Well, that's unfortunate.
[17885.24s -> 17892.17s]  Sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes to find a match.
[17895.45s -> 17897.13s]  Is it just because they're all full?
[17897.13s -> 17899.56s]  And a ton of people are trying to join at the same time?
[17903.10s -> 17904.46s]  This has been okay recently.
[17910.54s -> 17913.02s]  You can't select Battle Royale.
[17913.02s -> 17913.42s]  I see.
[17918.25s -> 17919.37s]  Well, shit.
[17919.37s -> 17926.66s]  All right, let's go...
[17929.83s -> 17930.63s]  Server.
[17930.63s -> 17937.96s]  Five out of six.
[17937.96s -> 17939.08s]  That's a little one.
[17939.08s -> 17942.55s]  Maybe we should do a little one.
[17943.43s -> 17949.05s]  It's Horde.
[17949.05s -> 17952.89s]  Horde would be fun with an actual five or six people you know.
[17955.58s -> 17958.78s]  Here's Battle Royale right here.
[17958.78s -> 17959.74s]  Can I just join this?
[17963.99s -> 17965.59s]  I guess so.
[17965.59s -> 17970.74s]  Interesting.
[17971.30s -> 17974.06s]  I think so.
[17983.10s -> 17986.09s]  Hide the server browser.
[17986.09s -> 17989.21s]  Yeah, but there's really nothing you can do about it.
[17989.21s -> 17995.10s]  Because, I mean, it's not that hard in an attempt of me to hide the server.
[17995.98s -> 17999.02s]  I mean, how many VR games are currently running right now, you know?
[17999.02s -> 18000.68s]  It wouldn't be that difficult to find it.
[18001.40s -> 18012.52s]  Hi-yah!
[18012.84s -> 18021.83s]  This might even be the only Battle Royale server that's on, like, U.S. West.
[18022.55s -> 18024.07s]  That has players accepting it.
[18024.07s -> 18025.35s]  So it's like, hey, I'm in VR!
[18026.46s -> 18027.42s]  No, unless you had...
[18027.42s -> 18029.26s]  Unless matchmaking works, that's not gonna happen.
[18033.03s -> 18033.99s]  Life is bald.
[18037.51s -> 18038.95s]  Old guy versus young guy.
[18038.95s -> 18040.78s]  Who do you think?
[18040.78s -> 18042.06s]  I think young guy's gonna pull through.
[18043.10s -> 18045.66s]  Old guy has the upper hand now, but I think young guy's gonna throw a few punches here
[18045.66s -> 18046.46s]  and knock him out with one hit.
[18047.66s -> 18048.62s]  I'm commentating.
[18048.62s -> 18051.58s]  You don't come attack the guy broadcasting the game.
[18052.14s -> 18053.50s]  I'm broadcasting the fight.
[18053.50s -> 18054.70s]  Why would you punch me in the face?
[18060.22s -> 18061.10s]  You punched the ref.
[18061.10s -> 18061.90s]  No, not even the ref.
[18061.90s -> 18064.38s]  I'm the guy with the microphone in the ring that wants an interview.
[18064.94s -> 18073.03s]  Can you die by that?
[18073.03s -> 18073.67s]  Quick, quick, quick.
[18073.67s -> 18075.67s]  Three, two, one!
[18075.67s -> 18077.43s]  Ah, all right, I need something.
[18083.90s -> 18084.62s]  Come on, anything.
[18085.58s -> 18086.38s]  Can I pick the horse up?
[18087.10s -> 18089.34s]  Can I hear horse, weapon, chest?
[18089.98s -> 18095.34s]  All right, I got a maul and a branch and a mace.
[18095.34s -> 18095.90s]  That's a lot.
[18096.70s -> 18097.50s]  No, don't use the branch.
[18097.50s -> 18098.06s]  Use the maul.
[18105.26s -> 18112.06s]  My game environment is being compromised!
[18134.76s -> 18138.12s]  My game environment is being toyed with!
[18142.31s -> 18151.35s]  All right, this isn't gonna last for more than 15 seconds.
[18151.35s -> 18182.87s]  I hope you know that.
[18182.87s -> 18195.08s]  Someone else's gamer gunk is in my gamer zone!
[18195.08s -> 18195.72s]  All right, here we go.
[18206.71s -> 18207.99s]  Nobody can know who I am now.
[18207.99s -> 18223.83s]  Is this free for all?
[18223.83s -> 18226.04s]  I think so.
[18243.80s -> 18244.28s]  Damn it!
[18259.59s -> 18259.91s]  What?
[18271.66s -> 18272.06s]  What?
[18279.26s -> 18291.66s]  Packet loss, packet loss.
[18291.66s -> 18292.86s]  Oh, that's far.
[18292.86s -> 18302.30s]  That one's gonna come behind me, aren't they?
[18302.30s -> 18304.62s]  Damn it, I was so paranoid about somebody being behind me.
[18304.62s -> 18310.90s]  I don't know if it's Raider anymore.
[18310.90s -> 18314.20s]  I think I was having more...
[18315.74s -> 18317.90s]  Gamer fatigue also is probably settling in here.
[18317.90s -> 18328.28s]  Right in the head.
[18328.28s -> 18330.22s]  There's a naked guy.
[18331.86s -> 18332.34s]  Come on.
[18332.90s -> 18335.11s]  Come on, give me one of these.
[18338.18s -> 18339.46s]  Gamer fucking fatigue, man.
[18340.58s -> 18344.44s]  I just had the one zone I was going.
[18344.44s -> 18345.32s]  Good, I wanted to do that
[18345.32s -> 18347.24s]  because now I can play the class I want to play with.
[18347.24s -> 18375.03s]  Turned all the way around.
[18375.03s -> 18376.39s]  Let's watch the stamina.
[18391.64s -> 18392.36s]  Two!
[18392.36s -> 18405.08s]  Stamina, 100%.
[18405.08s -> 18406.36s]  Don't tell him I'm behind him.
[18408.30s -> 18409.02s]  Speaking of which...
[18415.99s -> 18416.63s]  Damn it.
[18421.02s -> 18433.30s]  That's not gonna kill me, right?
[18433.30s -> 18434.10s]  Jump!
[18434.10s -> 18442.70s]  Somebody behind you, somebody behind you!
[18442.70s -> 18445.37s]  That was not honorable.
[18445.37s -> 18458.34s]  Although I do it all the time.
[18458.34s -> 18461.85s]  Wow, that hurt.
[18461.85s -> 18462.25s]  Fuck!
[18463.29s -> 18464.17s]  He outplayed me there.
[18464.17s -> 18465.45s]  I was gonna debate...
[18465.45s -> 18469.62s]  I was gonna debate him.
[18469.62s -> 18470.26s]  You got...
[18470.26s -> 18471.30s]  No, you do your thing, do your thing.
[18471.30s -> 18472.82s]  I won't get involved.
[18472.82s -> 18500.20s]  Are we playing a game or are we having a picnic, fellas?
[18500.20s -> 18507.05s]  He blocked it.
[18509.06s -> 18509.94s]  Oh, he's stuck.
[18509.94s -> 18510.26s]  Okay.
[18512.23s -> 18514.42s]  Well, let's help him.
[18514.98s -> 18519.86s]  Did I die by the...
[18519.86s -> 18522.34s]  Oh, by Dothmal killed me?
[18522.34s -> 18532.38s]  Didn't think I was gonna do that.
[18532.38s -> 18533.18s]  Do you like that move?
[18533.18s -> 18536.46s]  I call that one the 1v1 lock-on technique.
[18536.46s -> 18536.96s]  Ready?
[18555.51s -> 18556.31s]  Thanks for the...
[18556.31s -> 18557.35s]  Thanks for the Band-Aid.
[18557.91s -> 18559.35s]  Oh, that was fucking ridiculous.
[18559.91s -> 18571.78s]  Oh, fuck!
[18571.78s -> 18572.98s]  I forgot you had those.
[18572.98s -> 18589.86s]  I can't...
[18589.86s -> 18591.22s]  I can't block with a Band-Aid?
[18591.22s -> 18592.74s]  What the hell am I thinking?
[18592.74s -> 18597.11s]  I'm trying to block with Band-Aids in my hands.
[18597.11s -> 18599.88s]  It's made out of cloth.
[18599.88s -> 18601.72s]  I'm not sure you're aware of that, Jeremy.
[18601.72s -> 18644.47s]  Oh, he's back.
[18644.47s -> 18647.93s]  Oh, good fake!
[18647.93s -> 18648.49s]  No!
[18648.49s -> 18656.23s]  The new D group keep looks really good.
[18656.23s -> 18659.85s]  The game is really fun.
[18670.18s -> 18671.38s]  Ha ha ha.
[18671.38s -> 18672.10s]  And I just got...
[18672.10s -> 18674.10s]  I aggroed both of them by doing that.
[18674.10s -> 18692.68s]  1v1 server...
[18692.68s -> 18693.56s]  Wait, am I...
[18693.56s -> 18694.44s]  It just says deathmatch.
[18694.44s -> 18695.64s]  Wait, am I ruining everything?
[18702.52s -> 18704.76s]  Other people are doing that to me, though.
[18704.76s -> 18705.24s]  Wait, wait.
[18705.24s -> 18710.60s]  Everybody is doing that to each other.
[18710.60s -> 18711.32s]  Wait, hold on.
[18712.87s -> 18715.43s]  I've been attacked from behind like five times.
[18715.43s -> 18716.71s]  It's because I started it?
[18717.67s -> 18718.87s]  That's not what happened, right?
[18719.86s -> 18723.99s]  I'm not the bad guy here, am I?
[18723.99s -> 18724.55s]  See?
[18724.55s -> 18725.05s]  Look.
[18730.87s -> 18731.27s]  Look at...
[18731.27s -> 18733.11s]  Say that with 1v1 server.
[18733.11s -> 18733.75s]  Yeah, okay.
[18735.53s -> 18737.05s]  I didn't...
[18741.37s -> 18742.01s]  If that's...
[18742.01s -> 18742.57s]  No way.
[18743.75s -> 18744.71s]  They didn't learn it from me.
[18744.71s -> 18747.19s]  They have the servers been running for like four days.
[18750.39s -> 18751.83s]  Look, I'm observing right now.
[18751.83s -> 18752.95s]  They're all just fighting each other.
[18754.54s -> 18756.38s]  They're just wildly swinging at each other.
[18757.02s -> 18759.21s]  That guy's got double frying pan.
[18768.54s -> 18770.14s]  I'm not listening to you guys about that.
[18770.78s -> 18773.70s]  Uh-uh.
[18773.70s -> 18775.46s]  It's just a fight each other server.
[18775.46s -> 18777.86s]  It's not about 1v1ing.
[18785.38s -> 18787.56s]  Oh, that was a big hit.
[18787.56s -> 18790.73s]  This is an RP server.
[18790.73s -> 18791.53s]  I'm doing it wrong.
[18806.17s -> 18813.74s]  Ooh, all right.
[18813.74s -> 18814.62s]  Oh, I bled to death.
[18814.62s -> 18815.10s]  Fuck.
[18815.10s -> 18816.09s]  He beat me.
[18817.42s -> 18819.91s]  Ah.
[18819.91s -> 18820.39s]  Oh.
[18820.39s -> 18823.27s]  That didn't just spawn right there, did it?
[18827.45s -> 18828.01s]  It's okay.
[18828.01s -> 18828.89s]  I made it.
[18828.89s -> 18831.21s]  I made it to the fray.
[18831.21s -> 18851.90s]  Where is he?
[18851.90s -> 18852.94s]  What the hell was that?
[18854.71s -> 18856.15s]  He like tripped over a few things.
[18876.09s -> 18878.47s]  Nice.
[18878.47s -> 18879.19s]  Ooh, here he is.
[18881.34s -> 18882.38s]  He doesn't have a sword.
[18882.38s -> 18895.61s]  What?
[18895.61s -> 18896.09s]  Nice.
[18912.70s -> 18913.66s]  Ooh.
[18913.66s -> 18921.16s]  Wait, no, I'm alive.
[18921.16s -> 18922.52s]  I got a Coke ad?
[18922.52s -> 18923.40s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[18923.40s -> 18925.18s]  Unless you don't...
[18925.18s -> 18926.14s]  Unless you like Coke.
[18926.14s -> 18926.70s]  I don't know, whatever.
[18926.70s -> 18937.61s]  Can I get a...
[18937.61s -> 18938.81s]  I took it back.
[18940.25s -> 18947.56s]  Oh, that's...
[18951.74s -> 18954.54s]  This game is fucking so funny.
[18954.54s -> 18957.78s]  Oh, he didn't even know.
[18957.78s -> 18972.04s]  I'm just gonna wait for it to happen.
[18972.04s -> 18973.48s]  I don't even care if I didn't get the kill.
[18986.81s -> 18987.85s]  Ooh, watch out.
[18988.41s -> 18998.58s]  Ooh, that was a double bait.
[19005.91s -> 19006.47s]  Holy shit.
[19006.47s -> 19007.67s]  Did you actually hit that?
[19007.67s -> 19013.58s]  Fuck, too early.
[19013.58s -> 19014.54s]  I'm taking him down with me.
[19015.10s -> 19021.99s]  He's got three pans.
[19021.99s -> 19029.80s]  All right, you and me, let's do it.
[19031.94s -> 19032.34s]  Honorable.
[19032.34s -> 19033.38s]  We'll do it honorably.
[19033.38s -> 19054.09s]  Oh, he's like spinning.
[19054.09s -> 19055.13s]  He's doing like a weird thing where he's...
[19055.13s -> 19057.10s]  Oh god, I'm dead.
[19057.10s -> 19058.06s]  No, don't fuck this up.
[19058.06s -> 19058.86s]  Ah.
[19058.86s -> 19061.18s]  He was like turning his back all the way.
[19061.82s -> 19063.11s]  He was going like this.
[19063.11s -> 19063.43s]  It was weird.
[19063.43s -> 19064.31s]  It's like throwing you off.
[19064.31s -> 19064.95s]  He goes like...
[19065.59s -> 19066.55s]  And then wraps around.
[19066.55s -> 19068.31s]  He like spins his back this way and then turns.
[19069.03s -> 19070.38s]  That's a pretty good tactic.
[19071.10s -> 19106.33s]  Rematch.
[19106.33s -> 19106.81s]  What?
[19106.81s -> 19116.68s]  Good job.
[19116.68s -> 19119.90s]  The spin doesn't do anything.
[19121.42s -> 19122.22s]  It's just a little...
[19122.22s -> 19123.18s]  Awfully.
[19123.18s -> 19127.67s]  I wish I could make some money.
[19127.67s -> 19129.11s]  The worst part about this is
[19129.11s -> 19133.13s]  not being able to unlock more weapons.
[19133.13s -> 19134.33s]  But I'll do...
[19134.33s -> 19139.58s]  I'll do like another two or three matches.
[19139.58s -> 19140.62s]  And then tomorrow we'll do...
[19141.50s -> 19144.46s]  Re-launch the game.
[19144.46s -> 19146.30s]  I did that before and it only worked for like...
[19146.54s -> 19147.34s]  Five minutes.
[19147.34s -> 19155.21s]  So we'll probably...
[19155.21s -> 19156.17s]  What we'll do tomorrow...
[19156.17s -> 19158.49s]  We'll finish Sam and Max season one tomorrow.
[19158.49s -> 19165.43s]  That's probably what will happen.
[19165.43s -> 19166.65s]  Because it was...
[19166.65s -> 19168.25s]  That it's about like five or six hours, right?
[19176.23s -> 19176.71s]  Same thing.
[19177.27s -> 19178.39s]  How do I 1v1 with a...
[19194.18s -> 19194.74s]  Head?
[19194.74s -> 19207.77s]  He dropped a bandage for you.
[19207.77s -> 19209.13s]  Is that what happened in my...
[19209.13s -> 19219.37s]  No, stop this.
[19219.37s -> 19229.43s]  Why am I doing this?
[19229.43s -> 19231.43s]  Gun game would actually be pretty cool here.
[19231.43s -> 19235.48s]  If they started you off with like the little potato knife.
[19235.48s -> 19240.23s]  Be the guy with the frying pan.
[19240.23s -> 19240.79s]  I can't.
[19240.79s -> 19242.23s]  I don't have a frying pan.
[19242.23s -> 19247.48s]  Now, are you ready?
[19248.70s -> 19249.74s]  Do we have to do this honorably?
[19249.74s -> 19250.70s]  Are we doing this?
[19251.02s -> 19251.82s]  Who's doing this?
[19251.82s -> 19254.14s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[19254.14s -> 19255.50s]  You both can't just come in at the same time.
[19257.19s -> 19258.23s]  Oh no!
[19262.09s -> 19262.89s]  Hey!
[19262.89s -> 19265.37s]  That's me from an hour ago.
[19265.37s -> 19266.81s]  I honorably would have...
[19266.81s -> 19268.63s]  You want a 1v1?
[19268.63s -> 19269.59s]  Is that what you want?
[19269.59s -> 19270.79s]  Is that what you want so bad?
[19271.35s -> 19279.59s]  I don't want to fight.
[19279.59s -> 19281.35s]  You're like so good at the game.
[19284.98s -> 19285.94s]  What do you want me to do?
[19286.76s -> 19288.68s]  How many hours do you have in this game?
[19288.68s -> 19306.66s]  How many days have you been playing all day?
[19306.66s -> 19307.86s]  Aim for the legs.
[19307.86s -> 19320.30s]  Dragging is the reason I didn't get into chivalry yet.
[19320.30s -> 19322.06s]  This feels slower than chivalry though.
[19322.06s -> 19322.62s]  This feels...
[19323.26s -> 19326.33s]  A chivalry was a little quicker, I think.
[19326.33s -> 19327.30s]  From what I remember.
[19333.48s -> 19333.80s]  I don't know.
[19333.80s -> 19334.76s]  I don't know when to go in.
[19334.76s -> 19355.99s]  I think I'm going in now.
[19355.99s -> 19357.29s]  Got panned.
[19357.29s -> 19359.29s]  Yeah, I gotta take a break too.
[19359.29s -> 19360.49s]  I've been playing for too long.
[19360.49s -> 19368.94s]  It's kind of blending together like it usually does.
[19390.76s -> 19392.44s]  I guess I'll do pan guy version two.
[19397.05s -> 19399.21s]  I didn't expect to kill that guy instantly.
[19411.34s -> 19411.98s]  Top of each other.
[19411.98s -> 19413.34s]  I didn't think that was gonna happen.
[19413.34s -> 19415.74s]  All right, another guy with a pan?
[19415.74s -> 19417.26s]  Are we doing pan three?
[19417.26s -> 19418.54s]  Okay, pan three.
[19418.54s -> 19419.58s]  No, this is not pan three.
[19430.68s -> 19439.70s]  How long is this map?
[19439.70s -> 19448.15s]  Oh, it's short, so we'll try it.
[19453.42s -> 19455.02s]  I thought for some reason that guy was gonna come in behind.
[19455.58s -> 19471.03s]  Who?
[19471.03s -> 19471.91s]  Who's coming in?
[19471.91s -> 19472.47s]  You?
[19472.47s -> 19474.54s]  Let's go.
[19507.10s -> 19508.78s]  You fight with disorder!
[19526.89s -> 19527.53s]  All right.
[19527.53s -> 19531.11s]  I think I gotta take a break from this game.
[19531.11s -> 19536.62s]  I need a mental break from five and a half hours straight of swinging swords at people.
[19544.44s -> 19545.48s]  We'll probably just hang out.
[19545.48s -> 19548.57s]  We'll hang out for like a half an hour.
[19548.57s -> 19551.80s]  Just chill.
[19554.07s -> 19555.99s]  And then tomorrow I'm gonna bring you...
[19558.76s -> 19559.80s]  Sam and Max.
[19561.40s -> 19562.44s]  Episode three.
[19562.44s -> 19565.69s]  We were in the middle of it, so we're gonna finish it.
[19565.69s -> 19575.88s]  Will I stream Mordhau again?
[19577.08s -> 19577.80s]  Once it works.
[19578.52s -> 19579.40s]  Completely.
[19579.40s -> 19585.58s]  I'd probably jump in here with some friends and do the horde mode.
[19585.58s -> 19591.11s]  Because there really is only so much of no progression that...
[19594.34s -> 19596.82s]  And like buggy servers not being able to do matchmaking.
[19598.97s -> 19599.85s]  You know.
[19599.85s -> 19606.58s]  So I am going to say goodbye for now.
[19606.58s -> 19611.54s]  For those of you that wanted to watch this game.
[19612.10s -> 19619.45s]  But for those of you sticking around, I'm just gonna chill.
[19621.69s -> 19622.81s]  We'll just hang out.
[19622.81s -> 19623.93s]  Probably do the bits too.
[19623.93s -> 19625.29s]  Just hanging out talking about stuff.
[19629.10s -> 19632.76s]  And I'll see you tomorrow if you're leaving for Sam and Max episode three.
[19632.76s -> 19635.00s]  And probably episode four and episode five.
[19635.00s -> 19637.34s]  Would you recommend this game?
[19637.34s -> 19638.14s]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[19640.22s -> 19643.74s]  Once all the bugs and everything are ironed out, this is gonna be a great game.
[19643.74s -> 19646.30s]  I mean it already is a great game, so yes.
[19647.27s -> 19652.33s]  Definitely.
[19652.33s -> 19654.33s]  Uh, I'm gonna get one more water though.
[19654.33s -> 19656.81s]  I'm like sweating in here.
[19658.38s -> 19661.46s]  Give me one second while I get a water.
[19661.46s -> 19662.58s]  And we'll come back and just chill.
[19663.59s -> 19664.47s]  See you very soon.
[19877.11s -> 19877.61s]  Okay.
[19882.34s -> 19886.52s]  What can I just put on the screen while we hang out and do bits?
[19888.25s -> 19892.98s]  I don't know.
[19892.98s -> 19894.42s]  Oh no, no GeoGuessr.
[19898.31s -> 19899.43s]  No GeoGuessr tonight.
[19905.43s -> 19907.59s]  Maybe we will just do the bits and call it.
[19910.50s -> 19912.18s]  That'll be just probably at about six hours.
[19912.18s -> 19913.06s]  Which is, that's fine.
[19913.86s -> 19914.42s]  That's good.
[19920.94s -> 19921.98s]  And we'll start tomorrow.
[19925.06s -> 19926.90s]  I really do want to set up that personality test.
[19926.90s -> 19928.66s]  That's probably what, I'm gonna try to get that done.
[19929.59s -> 19931.51s]  There's like two or three things that I really want to get done here.
[19932.07s -> 19936.92s]  But I'll see you tomorrow.
[19936.92s -> 19943.94s]  Don't worry.
[19943.94s -> 19945.06s]  Drink more water.
[19945.78s -> 19950.46s]  I actually, I drink a lot of water now since moving to Vegas.
[19954.04s -> 19955.88s]  Yeah LaboVR is on the table too.
[19956.52s -> 19958.47s]  There's a lot of random stuff to do.
[19968.14s -> 19971.48s]  Yeah, maybe we'll just do the bits and hang out.
[19973.11s -> 19974.63s]  This will take us to about six hours.
[19975.19s -> 19981.98s]  I'm gonna grab some food and we'll go tomorrow.
[19985.03s -> 19985.91s]  Poor Far Cry.
[19985.91s -> 19987.03s]  Oh no, Far Cry.
[19987.03s -> 19988.23s]  I forgot about Far Cry.
[19989.70s -> 19991.46s]  Instead of Jerma lied about certain things,
[19991.46s -> 19993.94s]  you should just do Jerma forgot about certain things.
[19996.68s -> 19998.28s]  That actually is way more accurate.
[19999.22s -> 20001.30s]  Jerma forgot about Far Cry.
[20001.86s -> 20005.43s]  Jerma forgot about Sam and Max.
[20005.43s -> 20007.27s]  Jerma forgot about Minecraft.
[20007.99s -> 20011.16s]  Jerma forgot about Dragon's Dogma.
[20011.16s -> 20011.88s]  There you go, you got it.
[20012.44s -> 20017.61s]  Jerma lied is more clickbaity.
[20018.65s -> 20019.77s]  Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[20020.70s -> 20021.66s]  But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[20022.22s -> 20024.38s]  We'll go back to about six hours ago.
[20025.75s -> 20028.07s]  To Louis with six bucks.
[20028.07s -> 20030.07s]  Six hours ago, six dollars from Louis.
[20030.97s -> 20031.69s]  They just say hi.
[20033.27s -> 20036.36s]  Thank you, Louis, for the six bucks.
[20037.16s -> 20041.00s]  We had 10, 15 community subs from Squirds that I missed.
[20042.10s -> 20044.82s]  I was very focused in the first couple hours of the stream.
[20044.82s -> 20046.42s]  And I think we'll be in italics of trying to
[20047.30s -> 20049.54s]  get in a lobby and stuff and it just wasn't working.
[20049.54s -> 20052.02s]  But thank you so much for the 15 community subs.
[20052.98s -> 20056.86s]  It's a lot.
[20056.86s -> 20057.26s]  Thank you.
[20058.14s -> 20065.72s]  When's the next big stream event?
[20066.36s -> 20072.42s]  Hopefully soon, because I started working on
[20073.38s -> 20075.86s]  something very in particular that I've talked about recently.
[20076.66s -> 20079.40s]  It should be a blast.
[20080.12s -> 20082.39s]  The pieces all have to come together though.
[20082.39s -> 20084.07s]  I don't think that'll be more than another month.
[20084.79s -> 20086.57s]  It'll be within the next 30 days.
[20088.82s -> 20089.94s]  No, not green screen, too.
[20090.58s -> 20092.38s]  Something a little more weird.
[20098.06s -> 20098.86s]  Hopefully it works.
[20103.35s -> 20104.95s]  But PeacefulHaley, thanks for the 250.
[20105.67s -> 20107.03s]  Hey Jerma, how was your vacation?
[20108.17s -> 20108.65s]  It was good.
[20109.29s -> 20110.01s]  Hope all is well.
[20110.01s -> 20112.73s]  I auditioned for something recently and I felt really confident.
[20113.45s -> 20115.67s]  I had it in my head that I was going to get it,
[20115.67s -> 20118.39s]  but I found out today that I didn't get casted.
[20118.39s -> 20119.35s]  Hurts my feelings a lot,
[20119.35s -> 20122.15s]  but I guess this is just what I have to go through till I get casted.
[20122.79s -> 20125.83s]  I guess it just sucks because I really felt confident.
[20125.83s -> 20127.03s]  I don't usually feel that way.
[20127.75s -> 20129.11s]  Maybe I didn't do as well as I thought.
[20130.54s -> 20132.94s]  Well, I think you're approaching it the wrong way.
[20133.74s -> 20134.94s]  I'll tell you exactly why.
[20136.98s -> 20140.92s]  Because every single role that you audition for
[20142.87s -> 20146.23s]  is not a role that you kind of have to look at it like
[20147.35s -> 20148.63s]  audition for a bunch of stuff.
[20149.67s -> 20151.83s]  And if you get one of them, great.
[20152.47s -> 20154.79s]  But if you get attached to a role
[20155.75s -> 20158.71s]  before you even have a part in it,
[20160.23s -> 20160.63s]  you'll be like,
[20160.63s -> 20162.47s]  oh shit, I really wanted that fucking part.
[20162.47s -> 20163.99s]  I really wanted to do that.
[20163.99s -> 20165.19s]  I wanted to do that.
[20165.19s -> 20166.07s]  It should be me, right?
[20166.07s -> 20168.15s]  You get kind of stuck in there.
[20168.87s -> 20172.47s]  But the way to combat that is to just keep auditioning for things
[20172.47s -> 20176.07s]  and then by the time you audition for another three, four, five things,
[20176.07s -> 20177.43s]  the thing you auditioned for earlier,
[20178.23s -> 20179.91s]  you don't even care about it anymore.
[20183.29s -> 20188.36s]  Also, it can take a while for anything like that to even happen.
[20188.92s -> 20197.77s]  You know, casting and acting and it's a tough business
[20198.58s -> 20200.50s]  because there's a lot of people also doing it too.
[20201.06s -> 20205.90s]  So if you like a regular job process,
[20205.90s -> 20207.58s]  yeah, I mean, that's what it is.
[20209.34s -> 20211.26s]  When you go, when you send an audition tape in
[20211.82s -> 20216.86s]  or if you put in an application to a job,
[20217.66s -> 20218.70s]  they're kind of the same thing.
[20220.44s -> 20221.96s]  Maybe they didn't think that you were right for it.
[20221.96s -> 20222.84s]  That happens all the time.
[20223.48s -> 20234.26s]  You talk like you used to be an actor.
[20236.50s -> 20239.38s]  Well, I mean, I've been in a few things
[20242.14s -> 20245.74s]  and I had like demo tapes and reels and stuff.
[20245.74s -> 20247.74s]  I've done all kinds of stuff like that before.
[20248.90s -> 20250.18s]  Not even professionally either.
[20250.18s -> 20251.54s]  Like this is all stuff from years ago.
[20252.26s -> 20256.02s]  I used to do that instead of doing YouTube videos.
[20256.02s -> 20256.58s]  It was what I did.
[20256.58s -> 20257.46s]  I just did it online.
[20263.00s -> 20263.88s]  Send a tape?
[20267.35s -> 20269.51s]  Yeah, the best advice that I can give with that is
[20272.34s -> 20274.50s]  you do not go into auditions
[20275.14s -> 20276.66s]  thinking you're going to get the part.
[20278.41s -> 20279.61s]  You should go into auditions
[20279.61s -> 20283.86s]  thinking that you have an opportunity to and a chance to
[20284.50s -> 20286.74s]  and you're in that with everybody else.
[20288.42s -> 20292.34s]  So you should try to rise above everybody else
[20292.34s -> 20295.14s]  because you know that it's not certain.
[20295.14s -> 20297.38s]  So try to do a better job than everybody else, right?
[20298.26s -> 20302.98s]  But I wish you luck.
[20306.25s -> 20310.06s]  Punch away at a few more auditions, see what happens.
[20310.06s -> 20312.06s]  You're never going to know what happens unless you try it.
[20317.91s -> 20318.71s]  But thank you.
[20318.71s -> 20319.59s]  With the 250.
[20319.59s -> 20320.15s]  Appreciate it.
[20323.91s -> 20325.75s]  My name is Peef.
[20325.75s -> 20326.71s]  Gave $10.
[20327.64s -> 20328.44s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[20328.44s -> 20330.76s]  They say P-P-P-Pass the Ale.
[20332.28s -> 20333.16s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[20339.29s -> 20339.69s]  Thank you.
[20340.62s -> 20341.66s]  I don't know what that's from but
[20345.35s -> 20345.91s]  maybe I do.
[20345.91s -> 20346.79s]  Maybe I've heard it before.
[20347.66s -> 20348.78s]  But I appreciate the $10.
[20348.78s -> 20349.34s]  Thank you.
[20349.34s -> 20350.14s]  My name is Peef.
[20350.86s -> 20360.92s]  What do you mean?
[20360.92s -> 20361.64s]  What are you talking about?
[20362.68s -> 20365.67s]  Passes off his dreams.
[20366.31s -> 20373.13s]  Jeremy's a lazy boy.
[20373.13s -> 20374.01s]  Oh, dreams.
[20374.89s -> 20376.41s]  Oh, his actual...
[20376.41s -> 20377.21s]  Okay, I see.
[20378.01s -> 20378.97s]  I see where you're going here.
[20383.16s -> 20383.88s]  Chunky baloney.
[20383.88s -> 20384.84s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[20384.84s -> 20385.88s]  Don't listen to them, Jerma.
[20385.88s -> 20387.24s]  I love your boomer techniques.
[20390.74s -> 20393.26s]  I was doing all right.
[20393.26s -> 20393.90s]  Okay.
[20393.90s -> 20398.52s]  I was doing okay.
[20399.32s -> 20401.08s]  And not about how good I'm playing.
[20401.08s -> 20402.28s]  It's about how much fun I'm having.
[20402.28s -> 20403.16s]  Don't you understand?
[20404.04s -> 20405.69s]  I hope you guys understand that.
[20412.25s -> 20414.01s]  Fun, Jerma, disgust.
[20414.01s -> 20415.13s]  No fun allowed.
[20415.85s -> 20420.09s]  Does this streamer have a dog?
[20420.09s -> 20421.13s]  Yes, this streamer does.
[20421.77s -> 20422.89s]  It's a Dachshund mix.
[20423.61s -> 20425.14s]  His name is Otto.
[20425.14s -> 20425.94s]  He's a very good dog.
[20426.50s -> 20427.38s]  Great dog, actually.
[20430.95s -> 20432.95s]  Thank you, Ixian Games, for the 550.
[20433.51s -> 20435.75s]  One of my rats is sick
[20435.75s -> 20437.75s]  and since you're the Jerma Rat Guy,
[20437.75s -> 20439.27s]  I figured I'd throw positive vibes
[20439.27s -> 20440.63s]  into the universe in your direction.
[20440.63s -> 20441.43s]  Thanks for the laughs.
[20442.15s -> 20446.12s]  Hopefully your rat is okay.
[20446.92s -> 20448.10s]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[20449.06s -> 20453.66s]  Thank you for hanging out.
[20456.52s -> 20457.16s]  Otto, all right.
[20457.16s -> 20460.12s]  Otto is in bed right now with Kim.
[20460.76s -> 20461.46s]  That's all.
[20463.43s -> 20467.85s]  But I wish your rat a swift recovery.
[20467.85s -> 20468.57s]  Hopefully they're okay.
[20469.37s -> 20475.02s]  Otto, waiting room.
[20475.66s -> 20480.34s]  Waiting room.
[20480.34s -> 20481.14s]  You've seen him before.
[20484.12s -> 20488.36s]  Hey, thank you to Zorro Carlos.
[20489.48s -> 20492.12s]  And it's an ASCII art.
[20492.12s -> 20493.16s]  I don't know what this is.
[20493.16s -> 20495.16s]  It looks like the first half
[20495.16s -> 20496.60s]  or first third of an ASCII art.
[20496.60s -> 20497.24s]  I don't know what it is.
[20498.04s -> 20502.34s]  The only ASCII arts that I know of,
[20503.30s -> 20504.26s]  I only know of two.
[20505.91s -> 20512.28s]  And one of them is Mario shitting and the gnome.
[20512.28s -> 20513.64s]  I don't know any other ASCIIs.
[20513.64s -> 20514.52s]  I don't think there are any.
[20524.78s -> 20526.78s]  I've never, I just go,
[20526.78s -> 20527.50s]  oh, there it is.
[20527.50s -> 20529.10s]  There's like that fucking, there it is.
[20529.10s -> 20529.60s]  Cool.
[20530.24s -> 20533.16s]  There's like Mario like shitting
[20533.16s -> 20534.04s]  or whatever he's doing.
[20534.68s -> 20536.75s]  I'm like, all right.
[20537.76s -> 20539.36s]  No other ASCII art exists.
[20546.91s -> 20547.87s]  I thought he was pissing.
[20547.87s -> 20549.87s]  I don't, it gets deleted so fast
[20549.87s -> 20550.91s]  I don't even know what it is.
[20552.65s -> 20554.09s]  It's on there for a tenth of a second
[20554.09s -> 20554.81s]  and it's just gone.
[20556.09s -> 20557.85s]  And look, I'm not going to go to Google
[20557.85s -> 20559.29s]  and be like, what's that ASCII art
[20559.29s -> 20561.69s]  where like Mario's naked and pooing?
[20562.41s -> 20563.76s]  Why would I ever do that?
[20564.40s -> 20574.12s]  That's not something that I want to
[20574.84s -> 20576.12s]  go look up for any reason.
[20576.68s -> 20582.80s]  If only you had a Chrome extension
[20582.80s -> 20584.24s]  that could let you see deleted messages.
[20584.24s -> 20585.68s]  I don't want to see deleted messages.
[20585.68s -> 20586.88s]  They're deleted for a reason.
[20587.68s -> 20590.54s]  Curiosity killed the cat, man.
[20590.54s -> 20592.94s]  I don't want to open up like a virus website.
[20593.82s -> 20601.82s]  But thank you Zorro Carlos for the top half
[20601.82s -> 20603.50s]  of I'm not sure what it is, but thank you.
[20605.96s -> 20608.04s]  Snoozing Copter, I have VTTV.
[20608.92s -> 20610.20s]  Snoozing Copter, thanks for the 250.
[20610.20s -> 20611.08s]  Hey, I just want to say thank you
[20611.08s -> 20612.76s]  for showing me that Dreams exists.
[20613.48s -> 20615.90s]  I was a huge little big planet fan.
[20615.90s -> 20617.26s]  I never knew this game was in development
[20617.26s -> 20618.78s]  until you first mentioned it some time ago.
[20619.34s -> 20621.50s]  Can't wait for the insane shit people make.
[20622.14s -> 20624.06s]  You could have played the tutorials on stream, by the way.
[20624.06s -> 20625.42s]  They're much more fun and interactive
[20625.42s -> 20627.42s]  than the first introductory tutorial.
[20627.42s -> 20629.02s]  Would have been nice learning along with you.
[20629.66s -> 20631.42s]  Whatever, looking forward to it regardless.
[20632.30s -> 20635.00s]  No, I thought about it, but
[20638.81s -> 20641.02s]  there's two sides to that coin, right?
[20641.98s -> 20648.00s]  The first side is just play the game
[20648.00s -> 20649.28s]  and do all the tutorials
[20649.28s -> 20650.88s]  and sit there for three, four, five hours
[20650.88s -> 20652.24s]  and just do the tutorials
[20652.24s -> 20653.36s]  and just enjoy the game.
[20654.92s -> 20659.24s]  But for a stream and a broadcast sense,
[20659.80s -> 20662.04s]  a live video sense,
[20664.04s -> 20665.72s]  I don't know if I want that stream
[20665.72s -> 20669.34s]  just because that other side of the coin.
[20669.34s -> 20670.62s]  The first side is great.
[20670.62s -> 20671.66s]  We do it all the time,
[20671.66s -> 20672.78s]  just hanging out and playing the game.
[20675.42s -> 20678.04s]  But still, remember,
[20678.04s -> 20680.28s]  I only stream three or four days a week.
[20682.06s -> 20685.18s]  Sometimes maybe, it depends on the week, right?
[20685.18s -> 20688.14s]  Maybe four times, maybe five maybe
[20688.14s -> 20689.02s]  if something's going on.
[20690.57s -> 20692.97s]  So I want all the streams that happen
[20694.01s -> 20694.89s]  to have something,
[20697.00s -> 20698.44s]  at least something significant to happen.
[20700.19s -> 20701.95s]  Not every stream has to be crazy,
[20701.95s -> 20703.87s]  but if I'm given the opportunity
[20703.87s -> 20707.79s]  to play Dreams and stream the tutorial
[20707.79s -> 20709.71s]  for one of my streams during the week
[20709.71s -> 20712.68s]  or check out more of the content
[20712.68s -> 20714.20s]  that's available to watch,
[20714.20s -> 20715.56s]  I'll do that one first, right?
[20719.10s -> 20720.94s]  That's not to say that I don't
[20720.94s -> 20722.46s]  just hang out and play a game sometimes.
[20722.46s -> 20723.34s]  I did that tonight.
[20725.15s -> 20726.59s]  But playing this game
[20726.59s -> 20728.83s]  and throwing axes at people
[20728.83s -> 20730.75s]  and these giant battles,
[20730.75s -> 20732.11s]  I think is more engaging
[20732.99s -> 20734.75s]  than simply just doing tutorials
[20734.75s -> 20735.47s]  for five hours.
[20736.75s -> 20738.59s]  That's kind of the deal.
[20747.21s -> 20748.41s]  Nothing will compare to German
[20748.41s -> 20749.85s]  crying and farting noises.
[20750.65s -> 20752.32s]  I don't think I'll ever be able to see
[20752.32s -> 20753.76s]  some or do something like that again.
[20754.32s -> 20756.56s]  That was just that stupid and ridiculous.
[20757.60s -> 20759.76s]  You did a seven-hour stream
[20759.76s -> 20761.36s]  on that dumb newspaper game.
[20761.36s -> 20762.16s]  Newspaper game.
[20762.96s -> 20766.52s]  But also, I mean, I don't have
[20768.64s -> 20770.64s]  a certain thing that I do every time.
[20771.92s -> 20773.28s]  Picross? Picross is great.
[20780.76s -> 20782.28s]  I decide what I'm going to stream.
[20783.00s -> 20784.76s]  Usually, if it's not something
[20784.76s -> 20785.88s]  that's a big elaborate plan,
[20786.76s -> 20788.28s]  usually that week I decide,
[20788.28s -> 20789.16s]  hey, what's coming up?
[20789.16s -> 20789.72s]  What's out now?
[20789.72s -> 20790.60s]  What do I want to try?
[20790.60s -> 20791.40s]  That looks like fun.
[20791.40s -> 20792.44s]  No, no, I don't want to do that.
[20794.89s -> 20796.33s]  So if during the week,
[20796.33s -> 20798.01s]  hey, I'm going to play Sam and Max tomorrow.
[20798.01s -> 20799.21s]  That's just what I'm going to do.
[20800.17s -> 20801.77s]  I'm going to play Picross tomorrow, right?
[20802.57s -> 20805.90s]  That is what it is.
[20806.46s -> 20807.72s]  But I do appreciate that.
[20807.72s -> 20809.48s]  Thank you so much, snoozingcopter.
[20810.12s -> 20811.18s]  I can't wait to see
[20811.18s -> 20812.22s]  what people come up with in dreams.
[20812.22s -> 20813.98s]  I'm going to try to make at least a few things
[20813.98s -> 20815.10s]  that are worth showing.
[20815.10s -> 20816.06s]  Maybe we'll find out.
[20816.86s -> 20821.15s]  Freudian weapon, thanks to the 250.
[20822.25s -> 20822.73s]  No message.
[20822.73s -> 20824.73s]  They just say bleed purple bonus.
[20825.61s -> 20827.76s]  Is there like a bit bonus going on or something?
[20828.48s -> 20829.04s]  But thank you.
[20831.12s -> 20832.88s]  Sawdust bunnies, thanks to the 360.
[20833.76s -> 20835.60s]  Bonus 36.
[20835.60s -> 20836.00s]  Thank you.
[20836.72s -> 20838.81s]  So there is a bit bonus going on.
[20838.81s -> 20841.13s]  Cool. Thank you, guys.
[20841.77s -> 20844.41s]  We got Tingy for 250.
[20844.41s -> 20845.05s]  Thank you, Tingy.
[20845.77s -> 20848.09s]  Hey, dude, I went to go look for another battle royale.
[20848.09s -> 20849.37s]  I couldn't find one.
[20849.37s -> 20849.85s]  I searched.
[20849.85s -> 20851.85s]  I was going on the browsing category list.
[20851.85s -> 20853.53s]  I didn't find anyone playing battle royale.
[20853.53s -> 20854.09s]  Are you sure?
[20854.09s -> 20855.77s]  Maybe you were speaking out of tone there.
[20855.77s -> 20856.49s]  Oh, fuck.
[20858.17s -> 20858.65s]  Okay.
[20858.65s -> 20859.77s]  Yeah, I didn't.
[20859.77s -> 20861.29s]  I forgot what I said three hours ago.
[20870.03s -> 20870.83s]  God damn it.
[20880.28s -> 20881.72s]  Thank you, Tingy, for the 250.
[20883.18s -> 20885.10s]  Deep fried Gundam, thanks to the six bucks.
[20887.18s -> 20888.54s]  Six dollars from deep fried Gundam.
[20888.54s -> 20889.58s]  Well, I can't believe it's been two years
[20889.58s -> 20890.70s]  since I subbed to you, Jermbo.
[20891.34s -> 20892.30s]  Anyway, just wanted to let you know
[20892.30s -> 20894.46s]  how much you've helped me these past couple years.
[20894.46s -> 20896.86s]  Dealing with some crazy anxiety pretty much all my life
[20896.86s -> 20898.30s]  and your streams and videos have helped me
[20898.30s -> 20899.74s]  totally forget about it.
[20899.74s -> 20901.10s]  Even if it's just for a couple minutes.
[20901.90s -> 20903.26s]  So from the absolute bottom of my heart,
[20903.26s -> 20903.98s]  thank you so much.
[20906.49s -> 20907.21s]  It's my pleasure.
[20907.21s -> 20908.81s]  Thank you, deep fried Gundam.
[20912.72s -> 20914.40s]  I'm really happy that you enjoy the streams.
[20914.40s -> 20916.64s]  I'm really happy you enjoy the videos.
[20916.64s -> 20922.62s]  And thank you for being subscribed for two years.
[20923.42s -> 20925.55s]  That means a lot.
[20925.55s -> 20926.43s]  Thank you.
[20926.43s -> 20927.79s]  That's a fucking long time.
[20932.22s -> 20933.02s]  I wish you the best.
[20933.66s -> 20934.92s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[20935.72s -> 20938.60s]  You've got a great name, too.
[20941.05s -> 20942.09s]  Thank you for peeing?
[20942.89s -> 20948.33s]  What?
[20948.33s -> 20948.81s]  All right.
[20948.81s -> 20951.93s]  What is the pee poo obsession?
[20952.96s -> 20954.88s]  The pee pee poo poo thing?
[20954.88s -> 20955.76s]  Why is there?
[20955.76s -> 20956.40s]  What is that?
[20956.96s -> 20966.08s]  But is, okay.
[20966.08s -> 20968.32s]  But is that from something in particular
[20968.32s -> 20973.39s]  or is it just so stupid that it's funny?
[20973.39s -> 20974.67s]  I mean, I can get it.
[20975.63s -> 20976.27s]  I said that.
[20976.27s -> 20977.31s]  Did I say that before?
[20978.35s -> 20986.40s]  No, I didn't make that up.
[20987.68s -> 20989.52s]  Somebody just typed it one day on the internet
[20989.52s -> 20990.88s]  and then people started typing it again.
[20991.60s -> 20993.95s]  And you keep encouraging it.
[20993.95s -> 20994.35s]  Whatever.
[20994.35s -> 20995.47s]  I hope you have fun.
[20996.19s -> 20997.37s]  As long as you have fun.
[20997.37s -> 20998.25s]  I hope you're having fun.
[20999.13s -> 21000.09s]  Remember the guys that were building
[21000.09s -> 21002.01s]  the Fortnite Minecraft base in the game?
[21002.01s -> 21003.21s]  I hope you're having fun.
[21003.21s -> 21012.78s]  Sound like you.
[21012.78s -> 21014.14s]  Oh, it's instead of being,
[21014.14s -> 21015.26s]  it sounded like you said peeing.
[21015.26s -> 21015.58s]  I see.
[21016.22s -> 21018.84s]  Hey, Meef Playable, thanks for the $2.69.
[21018.84s -> 21021.16s]  BRB, designing a game where you have to have sex
[21021.16s -> 21023.32s]  with your teammates to respond dead players.
[21029.00s -> 21030.20s]  That would be pretty wild.
[21030.84s -> 21036.67s]  Imagine a game where you had to, you had to like,
[21037.47s -> 21038.67s]  no, it wouldn't even have to be,
[21038.67s -> 21039.95s]  you'd just be like procreation,
[21039.95s -> 21041.07s]  like cells or something.
[21041.79s -> 21047.39s]  This should be like a cell first person shooter
[21047.39s -> 21048.67s]  where you have to like spread out
[21048.67s -> 21058.33s]  and make it injured.
[21058.33s -> 21058.97s]  Does it exist?
[21060.09s -> 21062.00s]  No, not like Spore.
[21064.96s -> 21066.64s]  I guess this, this is a Garrio.
[21067.20s -> 21068.32s]  That game does already exist.
[21068.32s -> 21068.82s]  Nevermind.
[21072.89s -> 21075.45s]  Hey, Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $20.
[21076.57s -> 21078.24s]  20 bucks from Dr. Pepper.
[21078.24s -> 21079.36s]  German movie when?
[21080.24s -> 21082.46s]  German movie when?
[21086.97s -> 21089.00s]  I have some ideas.
[21089.56s -> 21092.59s]  We'll see if they end up coming to fruition or not.
[21094.80s -> 21102.92s]  I have a few things that should happen.
[21103.96s -> 21105.08s]  Before the summer is over,
[21107.20s -> 21108.64s]  there should be at least two or three
[21109.90s -> 21113.02s]  elaborate streams that happen before summer's end.
[21114.73s -> 21117.29s]  They, I don't know why they wouldn't happen,
[21124.03s -> 21126.99s]  but thank you, Dr. Pepper, for the $22.
[21127.71s -> 21128.70s]  Appreciate it.
[21129.26s -> 21131.82s]  Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the $15.
[21131.82s -> 21133.42s]  Would this convince you to use the loot
[21133.42s -> 21134.22s]  for a couple of rounds?
[21134.22s -> 21135.02s]  I beg you.
[21135.74s -> 21137.76s]  I beg of you as a bard.
[21139.34s -> 21141.26s]  I used it for a couple of rounds.
[21141.26s -> 21143.02s]  I just don't, didn't like the building.
[21143.90s -> 21148.73s]  With coordination that would work very well with the team,
[21149.53s -> 21152.19s]  but I just want to slash at people
[21152.19s -> 21154.43s]  and laugh at rocks being thrown.
[21155.23s -> 21157.47s]  When's the next Labo stream?
[21157.47s -> 21159.71s]  That Labo stream is going to be, are you ready?
[21160.76s -> 21171.55s]  The Nintendo Labo stream is going to be on Saturday.
[21172.03s -> 21177.95s]  Saturday, the 4th of May.
[21181.05s -> 21182.65s]  Maybe I'll have a few glasses of wine?
[21183.29s -> 21188.83s]  Maybe I'll break something in my room?
[21188.83s -> 21189.47s]  Probably not.
[21193.20s -> 21194.96s]  And I'm going to be dressed as Darth Vader
[21194.96s -> 21196.08s]  because it's Star Wars day.
[21196.80s -> 21198.81s]  Why do they say that?
[21198.81s -> 21199.69s]  No, I have to do that.
[21209.10s -> 21209.90s]  Don't do that.
[21211.58s -> 21213.18s]  Get a sound effects lightsaber.
[21213.18s -> 21214.94s]  What would that have anything to do with the Labo?
[21217.95s -> 21220.83s]  And have the Darth Vader voice on the whole stream?
[21225.26s -> 21231.74s]  Uh, no, I, nobody will, everyone will hate it.
[21231.74s -> 21232.94s]  Everybody hated Bugleberry
[21232.94s -> 21234.70s]  because he couldn't understand a word he was saying.
[21235.26s -> 21236.54s]  You think that'll happen on the Labo?
[21242.67s -> 21243.07s]  We'll see.
[21243.71s -> 21247.29s]  He wanted to do it, but he's blaming us.
[21247.29s -> 21250.49s]  No, I'm saying that's stupid enough
[21250.49s -> 21252.73s]  for where I think it's funny that I wouldn't want to.
[21257.64s -> 21258.14s]  Maybe.
[21259.21s -> 21260.89s]  I'll at least wear a Star Wars t-shirt.
[21260.89s -> 21261.45s]  Is that enough?
[21266.52s -> 21267.72s]  Fucking Bugleberry.
[21275.71s -> 21278.59s]  Bugleberry should do haunted house reviews.
[21279.23s -> 21282.51s]  I want it gets to be that time of year.
[21287.13s -> 21289.60s]  Yeah, that sounds like fun.
[21289.60s -> 21292.00s]  Do IRL haunted house reviews.
[21292.80s -> 21294.83s]  And the camera goes through with him
[21294.83s -> 21296.19s]  and he's criticizing things
[21296.19s -> 21297.71s]  and talking about how scary things are.
[21298.59s -> 21314.88s]  Bugleberry should be put in a retirement home.
[21314.88s -> 21315.84s]  He's not that old.
[21315.84s -> 21317.04s]  He's like 41.
[21318.08s -> 21319.36s]  Why do you think he's that old?
[21320.08s -> 21322.75s]  He's like six or seven years older than I am.
[21329.66s -> 21331.18s]  But thank you to Ert.
[21332.06s -> 21333.98s]  Ert110 for the five dollars.
[21334.62s -> 21336.81s]  Were you serious about community dream stuff?
[21336.81s -> 21338.41s]  If so, can we have a submission date?
[21340.40s -> 21341.44s]  I would say let's...
[21342.97s -> 21346.17s]  To make it for real, right?
[21346.17s -> 21346.97s]  Because somebody was saying
[21347.85s -> 21349.45s]  five or six days might not be long enough.
[21350.17s -> 21350.89s]  Let's say...
[21352.25s -> 21358.27s]  Well, remember, it's not a submission deadline, right?
[21358.83s -> 21360.35s]  Because I'm not compiling them.
[21360.35s -> 21361.55s]  What would happen is we would...
[21362.35s -> 21363.23s]  Let me look this up
[21363.23s -> 21364.51s]  because I want to make sure this is possible.
[21365.23s -> 21368.36s]  Have a tag or a searchable title tag or something
[21368.36s -> 21370.04s]  where we can get a playlist or something like that.
[21370.92s -> 21374.89s]  So it'd be easy for me to just type in the word germa
[21376.01s -> 21379.04s]  and have that just...
[21379.04s -> 21381.12s]  I can find them from there or from a hashtag.
[21381.12s -> 21382.40s]  Let me see if that's even possible
[21383.20s -> 21387.12s]  because this currently is the dream's early access program.
[21388.24s -> 21390.48s]  So all these features might not exist yet.
[21390.48s -> 21391.52s]  Let me figure that out.
[21392.48s -> 21396.06s]  But it would be at least a week from now.
[21401.88s -> 21403.88s]  But yes, I am serious about that
[21403.88s -> 21405.00s]  because I want to make stuff in it too.
[21405.64s -> 21408.60s]  At least movies or a short video
[21408.60s -> 21410.36s]  or a little game or something or a painting.
[21410.36s -> 21411.08s]  I want to do...
[21411.08s -> 21411.96s]  I want to at least make something.
[21411.96s -> 21413.24s]  I've been waiting for that game for a long time.
[21415.98s -> 21418.38s]  Hey, Mr. Comcast, thanks to the $5.
[21418.38s -> 21419.10s]  Hey, Germa.
[21419.10s -> 21420.70s]  John Comcast here.
[21420.70s -> 21422.86s]  Just letting you know that we here at Comcast
[21422.86s -> 21423.98s]  have forgotten about you.
[21424.54s -> 21425.90s]  Have not forgotten about you.
[21426.54s -> 21429.10s]  I personally caress a picture of your face
[21429.10s -> 21430.14s]  every night before bed.
[21430.78s -> 21432.62s]  But anyway, yeah, just calling to let you know
[21433.18s -> 21434.38s]  what we're about.
[21434.38s -> 21435.18s]  We're still around.
[21435.74s -> 21437.98s]  You know, if that cock stuff doesn't work out for you,
[21437.98s -> 21439.02s]  also ignore that guy
[21439.90s -> 21441.58s]  that comes to your house every morning
[21441.58s -> 21443.74s]  trying to break one of your windows with a brick.
[21443.74s -> 21444.78s]  My aim is pretty bad
[21444.78s -> 21446.54s]  so you shouldn't have to worry about it much.
[21451.36s -> 21452.40s]  Well, but why...
[21452.40s -> 21454.56s]  John Comcast, why do you say you're calling me?
[21456.36s -> 21458.20s]  Just calling to let you know we're still around.
[21458.20s -> 21458.92s]  This is a text.
[21461.31s -> 21462.59s]  Just calling to let you know.
[21463.56s -> 21466.44s]  A weird creepy ex-Comcast.
[21470.17s -> 21471.85s]  Well, Comcast, I'm sorry, but I have moved on.
[21473.40s -> 21473.96s]  You should too.
[21475.79s -> 21477.23s]  And let's get the credits rolling here.
[21479.29s -> 21480.89s]  Thank you, everybody that played.
[21480.89s -> 21481.61s]  If you jumped in.
[21482.33s -> 21484.78s]  If you jumped in and stream sniped me
[21484.78s -> 21486.38s]  and killed me over and over again.
[21486.38s -> 21487.18s]  Thank you for playing.
[21489.84s -> 21491.12s]  No, I'm kidding.
[21491.92s -> 21495.04s]  Thanks for playing.
[21495.04s -> 21496.08s]  That game's a lot of fun.
[21496.08s -> 21496.48s]  I'll probably...
[21496.48s -> 21497.04s]  You see it again.
[21497.92s -> 21501.00s]  Made Jerma mad.
[21501.80s -> 21506.25s]  Oh, fucking stream sniping.
[21506.97s -> 21512.97s]  Hey, long as you're having fun, right?
[21513.77s -> 21519.00s]  I need to have a permanent defender with a shield
[21519.80s -> 21521.32s]  that just gets in the fucking way
[21521.32s -> 21523.88s]  when somebody runs across the map to try to kill me.
[21524.44s -> 21527.48s]  I need someone just to always be looking for that.
[21527.48s -> 21529.48s]  I need to have my own personal shield butler.
[21530.04s -> 21540.52s]  A spy's statue.
[21545.40s -> 21546.52s]  Like a bodyguard?
[21546.52s -> 21547.72s]  Yeah, a shield butler.
[21549.88s -> 21550.60s]  A bodyguard.
[21551.24s -> 21551.80s]  You get it.
[21552.68s -> 21554.20s]  I'm going to have a bodyguard next time.
[21554.20s -> 21555.00s]  I'm going to make sure it's something
[21555.00s -> 21556.44s]  that's real fucking good at the game too.
[21558.92s -> 21560.28s]  You know, I might even hire that guy.
[21560.92s -> 21563.13s]  I might hire the guy.
[21563.77s -> 21565.45s]  Okay, you know how like sometimes people like...
[21565.45s -> 21566.57s]  You like hack something.
[21567.29s -> 21570.62s]  The hacker gets in and fucks up a bunch of stuff
[21570.62s -> 21572.14s]  and like the employees get a hold of him
[21572.14s -> 21573.90s]  and they're like, oh, hold on a second there.
[21573.90s -> 21576.54s]  We want to hire you to fix our infrastructure.
[21576.54s -> 21577.26s]  And they're like, what?
[21577.26s -> 21577.90s]  Fucking okay.
[21581.55s -> 21583.88s]  Maybe that'll be the defender.
[21596.38s -> 21600.14s]  And then I kick him off the cliff and exit the server.
[21600.70s -> 21609.72s]  I make him defend me for like 30 minutes
[21609.72s -> 21611.16s]  and then I'm like, all right, man, high five.
[21611.16s -> 21611.48s]  And I go...
[21612.86s -> 21615.42s]  And just off the fucking edge.
[21615.42s -> 21619.00s]  And I point down and I go,
[21619.00s -> 21621.08s]  that's what you get for crossing me.
[21621.16s -> 21622.60s]  That's what you get for crossing me.
[21623.40s -> 21627.53s]  And by this point, I have a full fucking hood up
[21628.09s -> 21631.21s]  and my skin is starting to turn like blue.
[21640.59s -> 21641.63s]  No, not green, blue.
[21648.57s -> 21649.77s]  Anyways, let's get the credits rolling.
[21649.77s -> 21651.21s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sam and Max.
[21651.85s -> 21654.73s]  And then this weekend we'll do the labo
[21654.73s -> 21657.29s]  and then probably in like a couple of weeks maybe
[21657.29s -> 21659.93s]  a little bit more we'll fucking try to dunk me in a tank
[21659.93s -> 21661.29s]  and see if anybody can do it.
[21662.17s -> 21663.45s]  You didn't hear about that stream.
[21663.45s -> 21664.57s]  That's the next...
[21664.57s -> 21666.57s]  Somebody asked what's the next big project.
[21666.57s -> 21667.37s]  It's that.
[21667.37s -> 21668.25s]  That's going to happen.
[21669.13s -> 21671.05s]  I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen.
[21671.05s -> 21674.09s]  Twitch controls robot to try to dunk Jerma
[21674.09s -> 21674.89s]  that makes fun of you.
[21678.68s -> 21679.72s]  There's the next project.
[21681.02s -> 21683.50s]  People need to know that it's going to potentially happen
[21683.50s -> 21686.62s]  because the stream just can't turn on with controls.
[21687.58s -> 21696.76s]  Jerma is going to get hypothermia.
[21697.48s -> 21700.52s]  It's going to be like 115 degrees in Las Vegas
[21700.52s -> 21701.32s]  during that stream.
[21701.88s -> 21708.40s]  Hypothermia.
[21708.96s -> 21711.48s]  It's going to be...
[21711.48s -> 21712.76s]  You guys aren't even going to be able to do it.
[21714.89s -> 21716.57s]  I don't think that you guys are going to be able to do it.
[21719.32s -> 21720.92s]  I'll be sitting there taunting you.
[21721.72s -> 21726.64s]  Why does the sus say next week?
[21727.44s -> 21727.92s]  Does it?
[21732.99s -> 21734.19s]  Next Wednesday.
[21735.31s -> 21736.75s]  Uh well that's definitely tomorrow.
[21739.29s -> 21740.57s]  See you next week.
[21740.57s -> 21742.57s]  I'm taking another week off guys.
[21742.57s -> 21744.57s]  Yeah my mother decided she was going to come back.
[21746.83s -> 21747.55s]  See you in a week.
[21749.72s -> 21752.04s]  No uh hold on I got it.
[21752.04s -> 21752.28s]  I got it.
[21752.28s -> 21752.36s]  I got it.
[21752.36s -> 21752.44s]  I got it.
[21752.44s -> 21752.76s]  Ready?
[21753.64s -> 21755.56s]  Let's run those credits.
[21759.47s -> 21761.31s]  Thank you for all the resubs and all the new subs.
[21761.31s -> 21765.23s]  All the everybody that decides to support this channel for $5 every single month.
[21766.27s -> 21769.82s]  You guys keep the wheels turning forever.
[21770.70s -> 21774.44s]  Anybody that contributes a cent to this channel.
[21776.32s -> 21781.36s]  You're the battery that powers the vehicle to drive on the road.
[21781.36s -> 21782.24s]  So thank you.
[21782.96s -> 21788.35s]  And let me edit that command.
[21788.35s -> 21789.55s]  Commands.
[21789.55s -> 21806.94s]  It's Wednesday right?
[21809.55s -> 21810.67s]  Wednesday.
[21810.67s -> 21811.47s]  Wednesday.
[21812.27s -> 21814.65s]  Weird way to say that.
[21825.08s -> 21825.96s]  That should be good.
[21828.01s -> 21828.33s]  Hey.
[21829.29s -> 21833.80s]  We also had uh one more bit come in from Jack.
[21835.56s -> 21835.88s]  Jack.
[21837.44s -> 21838.16s]  Jet Island.
[21838.72s -> 21839.88s]  Sorry he froze me.
[21839.88s -> 21840.52s]  Jet Island.
[21840.52s -> 21841.40s]  Thanks for the 250.
[21843.37s -> 21844.57s]  Yeah VR.
[21844.57s -> 21846.41s]  There's two games I need to complete in VR.
[21846.41s -> 21847.93s]  I need to do Gorn.
[21848.89s -> 21851.07s]  I'm gonna be honest with you though man.
[21853.07s -> 21854.19s]  That shit killed me.
[21854.75s -> 21856.03s]  I don't know what it is.
[21856.03s -> 21858.59s]  Something about the last week of doing VR.
[21859.15s -> 21861.63s]  I did like three or four days in a row or something of VR.
[21861.71s -> 21863.23s]  And it fucking killed me.
[21865.79s -> 21866.91s]  More so than ever before.
[21866.91s -> 21868.03s]  So I had to take a break.
[21868.03s -> 21869.47s]  I had to box it up for a little while.
[21870.91s -> 21872.27s]  Gork VR?
[21872.99s -> 21889.12s]  What do you mean it killed you?
[21890.00s -> 21892.72s]  It just drained me so much that I couldn't do anything.
[21892.72s -> 21894.16s]  I could barely get up the next day.
[21895.04s -> 21903.21s]  I got up and I was just I was decrepit.
[21907.16s -> 21908.12s]  VR hangover.
[21908.12s -> 21909.40s]  I think that's a real thing.
[21916.59s -> 21917.79s]  That's my life.
[21917.79s -> 21922.70s]  Yeah I know.
[21922.70s -> 21924.62s]  VR hangovers every day.
[21925.34s -> 21930.80s]  Imagine what VR will be like in five years.
[21930.80s -> 21931.84s]  I don't think there'll be a headset.
[21932.64s -> 21936.33s]  Remember when the 3DS came out and everyone was like that's not possible.
[21936.33s -> 21937.05s]  How does it work?
[21938.94s -> 21942.86s]  I'm not wearing stereoscopic 3D glasses right now.
[21942.86s -> 21945.50s]  How can I see 3D without having 3D glasses?
[21946.30s -> 21950.25s]  That type of technology was just out of this world.
[21950.25s -> 21951.37s]  It was impossible.
[21952.09s -> 21959.47s]  There'll be a technology that comes around over the next decade
[21960.43s -> 21962.19s]  where you don't have to have that headset on.
[21962.19s -> 21963.39s]  You're not even gonna have to have a TV.
[21964.94s -> 21969.82s]  You'll have a little dome that just projects onto a wall or into your living room or something.
[21971.64s -> 21976.84s]  Everyone will just put on glasses and sit back in the chair wherever they're sitting
[21976.84s -> 21978.04s]  and there'll be no television.
[21979.00s -> 21983.48s]  We'll all be watching the same thing but through glasses
[21984.94s -> 21988.78s]  or through a new type of media that is made up.
[21990.08s -> 21991.76s]  That shit's not gonna happen by the way.
[21992.40s -> 21993.04s]  I don't think it is.
[21993.04s -> 21995.20s]  I think we've plateaued in the electronic department.
[21997.52s -> 22001.52s]  And I know I'm gonna be one of those people that's quoted here 100 years in the future.
[22002.48s -> 22006.14s]  Remember when all the people like 150 years ago, 200 years ago,
[22006.14s -> 22008.14s]  they were saying that planes will never exist.
[22008.14s -> 22008.94s]  You'll never fly.
[22009.74s -> 22011.02s]  Birds only do that.
[22011.02s -> 22011.98s]  You're not a bird.
[22013.98s -> 22015.50s]  Idiots, imbeciles.
[22017.10s -> 22020.30s]  I'm probably gonna be one of those people that just says I don't think in 50.
[22020.30s -> 22023.02s]  I don't even know if in like 30, 40 years it might not be possible.
[22023.02s -> 22024.70s]  I think we've plateaued electronically.
[22025.42s -> 22028.54s]  Things will get faster but until quantum computing
[22029.26s -> 22033.04s]  deletes our universe, we'll see.
[22033.60s -> 22038.06s]  It's gonna be wild.
[22038.06s -> 22038.86s]  Guys, just watch.
[22039.42s -> 22041.34s]  They're gonna turn on the quantum computer
[22041.34s -> 22044.38s]  and a little red line is gonna shoot out just instantly.
[22044.38s -> 22048.14s]  They're gonna be like oh we programmed it to do Simon Says.
[22048.14s -> 22049.10s]  Things gonna turn on.
[22049.10s -> 22051.90s]  Quantum computer is gonna point a fucking laser beam at the wall
[22051.90s -> 22055.63s]  and just it's gonna be just deleting.
[22056.75s -> 22058.83s]  And they're gonna be like trying to turn the fucking thing off
[22058.83s -> 22062.59s]  and it won't turn off and just delete, delete, delete, delete.
[22062.59s -> 22064.67s]  It's gonna go in a line and start deleting the earth.
[22070.78s -> 22073.66s]  Just one line by line, just back and forth.
[22081.93s -> 22085.21s]  They'll drop a nuclear bomb on this thing and it won't work.
[22085.77s -> 22087.37s]  They'll just delete the nuke before it lands.
[22088.25s -> 22090.17s]  It'll just point up like a sentry and just
[22091.45s -> 22092.97s]  just paint it over it like an eraser.
[22101.29s -> 22103.87s]  So I have no mouth and I must scream.
[22103.87s -> 22105.87s]  They were on, come on.
[22108.03s -> 22112.43s]  Every major scientist, every brilliant scientist,
[22112.75s -> 22115.23s]  you know what they all say, the biggest threat to humanity
[22116.28s -> 22121.56s]  is AI, is quantum computing, that's the biggest threat.
[22121.56s -> 22122.28s]  That's what they've said.
[22128.06s -> 22130.54s]  I think I trust the greatest minds to ever live
[22130.54s -> 22132.78s]  to give us an accurate representation
[22132.78s -> 22134.46s]  of what we should potentially be afraid of.
[22135.34s -> 22143.02s]  That's what Stephen Hawking said.
[22144.70s -> 22145.98s]  You don't trust Stephen Hawking?
[22162.88s -> 22164.16s]  He's right about black holes.
[22166.43s -> 22168.88s]  Yeah, he said aliens.
[22169.52s -> 22170.80s]  He said aliens.
[22170.80s -> 22171.92s]  But he has to say, oh, did he?
[22184.20s -> 22185.00s]  It wasn't aliens.
[22186.20s -> 22194.80s]  By 2014, Stephen Hawking and business magnate Elon Musk
[22194.80s -> 22196.40s]  had publicly voiced the opinion
[22196.40s -> 22198.40s]  that superhuman artificial intelligence
[22198.40s -> 22201.52s]  could provide incalculable benefits
[22201.52s -> 22207.58s]  but also can end the human race if deployed incautiously.
[22210.76s -> 22213.88s]  There you go, it would end the human race.
[22217.10s -> 22218.38s]  I remember he said that.
[22218.38s -> 22219.98s]  He said that artificial intelligence
[22219.98s -> 22224.30s]  is potentially one of the biggest threat facing humanity.
[22229.26s -> 22232.19s]  Anyway, thanks for sticking around.
[22232.19s -> 22232.83s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[22241.45s -> 22242.41s]  Look up aliens.
[22243.29s -> 22246.65s]  Now, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[22246.65s -> 22248.09s]  Take care, have a good rest of your night.
[22248.73s -> 22254.91s]  See you really soon for Sam and Max episode three, part two.
[22256.14s -> 22256.54s]  Good night.
