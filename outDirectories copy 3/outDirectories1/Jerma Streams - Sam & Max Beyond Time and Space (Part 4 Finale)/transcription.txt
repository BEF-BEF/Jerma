[2.17s -> 6.17s]  Fuck the title. The title still says just chillin'. God damn it. Hold on.
[6.17s -> 11.34s]  I need to change this right now. I wasn't supposed to be like this.
[11.34s -> 23.77s]  Just chillin'. Oh no. Uh... lay... lay in low.
[23.77s -> 27.38s]  Ugh. I don't know. I have to keep it. I got nothing to put here.
[27.38s -> 33.58s]  Titlet colonoscopy reflections. I was gonna title it.
[33.58s -> 35.34s]  I'm not supposed to be here. It's only been like 30 seconds.
[37.05s -> 39.93s]  I was gonna... uh... hold on. I'll be right... hold on. See ya.
[40.57s -> 66.52s]  Okay, I'm back. I was... lay in low. Post colonoscopy stream session.
[66.60s -> 68.44s]  Chill session. This didn't just happen.
[69.16s -> 72.28s]  I didn't just get out of the procedure. That's kind of misleading.
[76.89s -> 77.93s]  That's a little misleading.
[80.15s -> 82.79s]  Hey, I just got out of my colonoscopy.
[83.43s -> 86.23s]  Five minutes ago. I'm gonna turn my stream on.
[89.29s -> 90.97s]  How am I doing? I'm doing all right. I'm doing good.
[93.98s -> 97.42s]  Butt hole. Yeah, I walked out of it. I'm still in my... what do they call them?
[99.98s -> 105.26s]  Johnny's? What do they call them? The open back ass dress? What's it called?
[110.25s -> 111.69s]  Diapers? No, I'm talking... a gown?
[112.84s -> 115.64s]  No, they're called like... johns or something.
[118.54s -> 122.14s]  Kilt? No, no, no, no. The tablecloth!
[123.11s -> 126.47s]  The blue picnic tablecloth that has the big open ass.
[127.80s -> 131.37s]  Why does it look like that, by the way? It does. It looks like a curtain.
[134.68s -> 136.52s]  Hospital gown. Yeah, but that's like the...
[137.08s -> 139.93s]  that's like the technical way to say it.
[141.13s -> 143.93s]  It's called like a... like a gurney or something.
[146.10s -> 149.38s]  Oh, I know what a gurney is. I'm not stupid.
[150.26s -> 152.63s]  Anywho, we can talk about it if you want.
[152.63s -> 155.03s]  I'll give you some insight if anybody wants to hear about it.
[155.99s -> 159.30s]  I mean, it depends on how much people want to hear about this.
[161.21s -> 163.61s]  Tell me everything. All right, I'll tell you.
[164.41s -> 170.10s]  All right, is there already a resident sleeper in the chat? Is that a bad sign?
[171.51s -> 173.83s]  Hey, don't tell your story about my colonoscopy.
[174.63s -> 175.13s]  Sleep.
[177.26s -> 178.30s]  Show us your ass.
[179.26s -> 182.52s]  Okay. No, no, it went well.
[184.04s -> 186.12s]  I still have to hear back for a couple things.
[186.12s -> 192.14s]  I had like two or three biopsies done, and it takes like three of...
[192.14s -> 195.50s]  it takes like more than two or three weeks for you to get results back on a biopsy.
[198.09s -> 203.08s]  I'm fine. The doctor said it doesn't have any major concerns.
[203.08s -> 204.52s]  The reason why I did it, people are going,
[204.52s -> 207.32s]  why are you doing a colonoscopy before like 50?
[208.50s -> 214.26s]  I have irritable bowel disease, and if you have irritable bowel disease
[214.26s -> 218.66s]  for more than like a decade, I started developing some new symptoms
[218.66s -> 221.96s]  that I wasn't really used to, and fast forward,
[221.96s -> 223.80s]  I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
[225.27s -> 229.18s]  And it is, apparently. Everything seems to be fine.
[229.74s -> 232.15s]  We'll wait and hear back from the biopsies,
[232.15s -> 233.75s]  but he said he didn't have any major concerns,
[234.47s -> 236.31s]  and that's the end of that, I guess.
[236.31s -> 238.39s]  I have been put on some new medication,
[238.39s -> 240.07s]  which is very, very hard to get used to.
[240.71s -> 246.25s]  I'm healthy. I'm, yeah, I'm doing all right.
[248.60s -> 250.28s]  But I'm on a new medication that's...
[251.32s -> 254.12s]  it's kind of odd and hard for me to get used to.
[255.00s -> 258.92s]  So, pardon my absence for the last four days or so, like three and a half, four days.
[260.02s -> 261.70s]  But I didn't really get... I couldn't eat anything
[262.66s -> 264.98s]  even a day or two after the procedure.
[264.98s -> 267.78s]  It was two days ago now, right? Let me see, yeah.
[268.42s -> 270.18s]  So no, yeah, it was like two and a half days ago.
[271.14s -> 274.50s]  I... I felt just like shit. I couldn't eat.
[275.38s -> 279.86s]  I was eating bread and scrambled eggs for like the last two days and peanut butter.
[283.03s -> 286.07s]  You forget how good food tastes when you don't get to eat it for four days.
[288.14s -> 289.82s]  I can eat now? Yeah, I can eat normally now.
[293.70s -> 298.18s]  A normal diet? Wait, bread, scrambled eggs, and peanut butter
[298.18s -> 300.02s]  for every meal is a normal diet?
[301.51s -> 302.31s]  I don't think so.
[304.34s -> 306.50s]  That's normal? Every day?
[310.98s -> 312.50s]  Don't get me wrong, I love peanut butter.
[317.61s -> 319.45s]  Remove bread and eggs and it's good.
[319.45s -> 322.17s]  Well, the reason why they're easy to digest foods.
[323.05s -> 326.89s]  White bread and scrambled eggs and peanut butter, they're easy to digest.
[327.53s -> 329.93s]  What do I eat normally?
[329.93s -> 331.29s]  Succulent fucking fish.
[332.86s -> 334.14s]  Broiled caviar.
[335.48s -> 336.92s]  I couldn't eat those things.
[336.92s -> 337.96s]  It was horrible.
[343.53s -> 346.89s]  Roasted legumes in a creamy tomato broth.
[346.89s -> 347.77s]  I couldn't have that.
[348.73s -> 350.09s]  It was hell on earth.
[359.05s -> 361.37s]  Anywho, so let me give you a breakdown.
[361.37s -> 363.85s]  I know I'm just kind of hanging out here, but I still am.
[364.81s -> 365.37s]  Not 100%.
[366.63s -> 368.49s]  I'm like 84%.
[369.37s -> 371.32s]  Because I'm still getting cramps.
[371.32s -> 372.60s]  And I actually talked to the doctor today
[372.60s -> 376.28s]  and you're not really supposed to have abdominal pain and cramps
[376.28s -> 377.48s]  like two or three days after.
[377.48s -> 379.96s]  So they're like, let us know in a couple days
[379.96s -> 381.64s]  if you're still having that.
[381.64s -> 382.44s]  And I'm like, okay.
[386.34s -> 391.77s]  But I'll be fine, don't worry about me.
[391.77s -> 392.73s]  Let the camera in.
[395.06s -> 396.26s]  Here's a breakdown of what's going to happen.
[399.19s -> 401.11s]  But let me be very clear about something.
[401.11s -> 402.07s]  This is very important.
[403.53s -> 404.25s]  Take care of yourself.
[405.05s -> 405.85s]  Take care of your health.
[408.50s -> 411.22s]  If you're able to and have some issue
[411.22s -> 413.06s]  that you want to just be reassured of,
[413.94s -> 415.38s]  go get seen, please.
[416.10s -> 418.87s]  You got to take care of yourself.
[422.63s -> 423.75s]  Just be careful.
[423.75s -> 424.55s]  Take care of yourself.
[426.70s -> 431.30s]  You got this one body and you want to keep it.
[435.66s -> 439.10s]  Hopefully, hopefully you do.
[440.63s -> 442.23s]  Big bits just came through.
[442.23s -> 443.11s]  Holy shit, they did.
[446.55s -> 447.99s]  Kali Brady gave 100 bucks.
[448.71s -> 452.14s]  $100, 10,000 bits.
[452.14s -> 453.26s]  Thank you so much, Kali Brady.
[453.26s -> 454.06s]  Really appreciate that.
[454.78s -> 459.94s]  Welcome back, Jerma.
[459.94s -> 461.46s]  Hope the recovery is brief and goes well.
[461.46s -> 464.84s]  Keep on being the best streamer.
[464.84s -> 465.72s]  Jerma Hart, thank you.
[466.68s -> 469.32s]  That's fucking incredibly nice thing to say.
[469.32s -> 470.60s]  I'm going fine.
[470.60s -> 471.80s]  Recovery is good.
[471.80s -> 472.92s]  I'm pretty much back to normal.
[473.72s -> 475.40s]  Which you'll see, I'll make all kinds of...
[475.40s -> 477.08s]  You thought like I was going to have a colonoscopy
[477.08s -> 478.60s]  and I was going to have any jokes the next day.
[479.32s -> 480.20s]  I don't have any.
[480.20s -> 481.56s]  So I've been like literally sleeping
[481.56s -> 482.92s]  and playing Hearthstone for four days.
[483.96s -> 485.40s]  I don't have any material.
[485.40s -> 487.64s]  And is that another 100 bucks that just came through?
[487.64s -> 488.52s]  No, it's the same one.
[489.16s -> 490.04s]  Stream Labs is late.
[493.83s -> 495.11s]  Hearthstone stream.
[495.11s -> 496.15s]  No, I'm not good.
[496.15s -> 497.03s]  I make mistakes.
[497.03s -> 498.71s]  I make tons of fucking mistakes.
[499.35s -> 503.91s]  I've been playing the new Dalaran expansion
[503.91s -> 504.79s]  and I make...
[504.79s -> 505.99s]  I fuck up so much.
[505.99s -> 507.11s]  But the best part about playing
[507.11s -> 508.55s]  those single player campaigns
[509.51s -> 510.23s]  is...
[510.23s -> 511.67s]  I'm going to give you an opinion here.
[511.67s -> 512.63s]  This is just my opinion.
[513.67s -> 514.71s]  I'm sorry if you don't like it.
[514.71s -> 516.15s]  If you think I'm wrong or stupid,
[516.71s -> 518.31s]  you're completely able to say that.
[518.95s -> 521.83s]  Hearthstone has kind of turned into like this clown show
[521.83s -> 525.11s]  where they've added so many crazy things to this game.
[525.11s -> 527.91s]  Oh, Echo has played the same card seven times.
[530.71s -> 532.15s]  Last time I played it, it wasn't like that.
[532.15s -> 533.83s]  And I'm just like, what the fuck is going on here?
[534.63s -> 535.35s]  There's like clown...
[535.35s -> 536.79s]  Yeah, there's clown cards in the game now.
[537.43s -> 539.91s]  Oh, cast a random spell at a random person
[539.91s -> 541.35s]  target selected randomly.
[542.33s -> 544.57s]  So when I play that game against other people,
[545.53s -> 546.81s]  I have no idea what I'm doing.
[546.81s -> 549.29s]  And it's just like embarrassing and frustrating.
[549.29s -> 550.41s]  When I play against a computer,
[550.41s -> 552.01s]  I get to use all the new cool, fun,
[552.01s -> 554.17s]  ridiculous, randomized clown cards
[554.17s -> 555.61s]  and beat the computer.
[555.61s -> 556.17s]  And it's fun.
[557.05s -> 563.83s]  I don't buy card packs.
[563.83s -> 566.39s]  No, I just play the solo adventures and they come up.
[566.39s -> 569.05s]  That's how I play most games, to be honest.
[569.05s -> 569.55s]  Yeah.
[571.86s -> 573.06s]  Solitaire mindset.
[573.06s -> 573.56s]  Yeah.
[576.26s -> 578.02s]  Yeah, it is very...
[578.02s -> 580.18s]  Okay, I can talk like shit about like
[580.18s -> 583.06s]  all these new ridiculous cards that I don't understand
[583.06s -> 584.82s]  that throw the game upside down for me.
[585.70s -> 590.10s]  But I have absolutely put into that Dalaran expansion.
[590.10s -> 590.74s]  Absolutely.
[590.74s -> 591.62s]  I mean, this is not even...
[591.62s -> 592.18s]  I'm not even kidding.
[592.18s -> 593.62s]  This is some big some kind of currency thing.
[594.26s -> 598.42s]  I've put probably 50 hours into it in the last seven days.
[598.42s -> 598.82s]  Had to...
[601.67s -> 605.43s]  Anyways, today I've been like away for like four days.
[605.43s -> 606.23s]  So I'm just trying to...
[606.23s -> 608.79s]  We're trying to get like a state of the channel address here.
[609.59s -> 612.01s]  Heroic mode.
[612.01s -> 612.89s]  I can't do heroic mode.
[612.89s -> 615.78s]  I'm too bad because I get fucking mad
[615.78s -> 617.14s]  and I like fucking grab my iPad
[617.14s -> 618.58s]  and I'm just like the fuck
[618.58s -> 621.22s]  and I like scream into the iPad like it's hearing me.
[623.29s -> 624.01s]  I can't do it.
[624.01s -> 624.57s]  I have to like...
[625.29s -> 628.89s]  Okay, you know when you have like your grandfather play a game
[628.89s -> 630.89s]  or like your mother or something
[630.89s -> 632.81s]  or like a friend of yours that doesn't play games
[633.69s -> 635.29s]  and before they get to touch it,
[635.29s -> 637.69s]  you turn the difficulty down to like zero
[638.41s -> 640.34s]  because you just want them to have fun.
[640.34s -> 642.18s]  I feel like that's what has to happen to me.
[642.18s -> 644.50s]  I have to like be given an experience that I look at
[644.50s -> 646.66s]  and I'm like, well, this is hard and crazy.
[647.22s -> 649.62s]  But it's on like zero and I get to go,
[649.62s -> 651.06s]  oh, I just see what I just did there.
[651.06s -> 653.70s]  I like in my mind, I calculated like lethal.
[653.70s -> 655.06s]  I'm on like the easiest difficulty.
[655.06s -> 656.10s]  I just feel good, you know.
[660.17s -> 661.77s]  My whole family are god gamers.
[661.77s -> 662.49s]  He's a child.
[664.52s -> 665.32s]  Hey, look at that.
[665.32s -> 666.12s]  You probably...
[666.12s -> 667.32s]  What's the name of the stream?
[667.96s -> 670.25s]  A very childlike.
[670.25s -> 671.61s]  Yeah, you have to give me something.
[671.61s -> 674.57s]  You have to give me like food
[674.57s -> 676.81s]  and tell me it's other food and make me believe you
[676.81s -> 678.17s]  and like tell me it's like Captain Crunch
[678.17s -> 681.19s]  but it's actually broccoli and I have to believe you.
[683.62s -> 684.02s]  What?
[684.02s -> 685.38s]  I don't want that.
[685.38s -> 686.58s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[686.58s -> 689.06s]  Jeremy, that's Captain Crunch broccoli.
[689.06s -> 689.38s]  What?
[689.38s -> 689.86s]  Is it?
[689.86s -> 690.66s]  Yeah.
[690.66s -> 692.02s]  Yeah, that's not regular broccoli.
[692.02s -> 693.78s]  That's Captain Crunch broccoli.
[693.78s -> 694.90s]  Oh, that means I like it.
[700.47s -> 701.35s]  Well, you know, it's just...
[701.35s -> 702.31s]  It's a power of suggestion.
[702.31s -> 704.07s]  You know that if you hand somebody...
[705.10s -> 705.98s]  I've been away for four days
[705.98s -> 707.50s]  so you've got to let me get this out.
[707.50s -> 710.22s]  You know if you hand somebody various liquids
[710.22s -> 712.78s]  that are just water with orange, red
[712.78s -> 714.06s]  or blue food coloring in it
[714.70s -> 717.35s]  and you tell them that the orange one is
[717.35s -> 719.27s]  orange tropical punch flavored
[721.11s -> 722.79s]  a certain percentage of people will taste it.
[723.43s -> 729.05s]  I was in that study.
[729.05s -> 731.45s]  He's on a tangent.
[731.45s -> 732.81s]  If I can tell you, I gotta get this.
[732.81s -> 734.01s]  You gotta let me get it out.
[734.01s -> 735.22s]  I haven't been here for four days.
[736.54s -> 739.10s]  But, okay, I was gonna break down what we're gonna do.
[739.10s -> 740.94s]  Anyways, colonoscopy good.
[741.74s -> 742.70s]  Everything's fine.
[742.70s -> 743.42s]  I'm good to go.
[744.14s -> 747.18s]  Sorry I was away for a few days here
[747.18s -> 749.26s]  but you know, I'm trying to take care of myself.
[749.82s -> 753.24s]  Today, tomorrow and Thursday, three days in a row.
[753.24s -> 755.64s]  Sam and Max and maybe Heroes of Might and Magic clean up.
[755.64s -> 758.28s]  Just chill while I get back to normal.
[758.28s -> 760.20s]  Tomorrow, cooking...
[760.20s -> 761.48s]  I'm talking like the stream's over.
[761.48s -> 762.12s]  It's not.
[762.12s -> 763.48s]  Tomorrow, cooking simulator.
[763.48s -> 765.16s]  Been waiting for that game for a long fucking time.
[765.72s -> 767.88s]  They delayed that game like seven times
[767.88s -> 769.24s]  and every time it was like a week away
[769.24s -> 770.04s]  I was ready to stream it.
[770.04s -> 773.06s]  They pushed it like another six months.
[773.06s -> 775.58s]  So cooking simulator tomorrow.
[775.58s -> 777.82s]  Thursday, if cooking simulator is a lot of fun
[777.82s -> 778.54s]  maybe I'll do it again.
[779.18s -> 780.30s]  Bingo.
[780.30s -> 781.10s]  Fast forward.
[781.10s -> 782.86s]  E3, E3.
[782.86s -> 787.70s]  I'm gonna do professional E3 breakdown streams
[787.70s -> 791.46s]  for all the major conferences like we did last year.
[792.54s -> 793.66s]  So that's what, three days?
[793.66s -> 797.99s]  It's what, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?
[797.99s -> 800.79s]  And then, excuse me, hold on a second here.
[800.79s -> 801.11s]  What's that?
[801.11s -> 801.99s]  You got something else planned.
[801.99s -> 802.95s]  I've been, what do you think I've been doing?
[802.95s -> 805.03s]  I've been playing Hearthstone and planning streams.
[805.03s -> 807.67s]  I've been lying in bed calculating lethal
[807.67s -> 809.19s]  and then what am I gonna do next week?
[809.83s -> 811.19s]  I'll show it to you right now.
[811.19s -> 811.75s]  I got this.
[812.63s -> 813.67s]  Wait, how do I look?
[813.67s -> 814.23s]  It doesn't matter.
[814.23s -> 814.63s]  Who cares?
[814.63s -> 816.39s]  I just had a colonoscopy, god damn it.
[816.39s -> 817.27s]  Let me look like shit.
[817.99s -> 818.63s]  I got this.
[819.27s -> 822.66s]  You know, you don't need to see me.
[822.66s -> 826.55s]  We're gonna play this.
[826.55s -> 828.47s]  This is a card game called Unlock
[829.27s -> 832.17s]  where you have to escape from the scary carnival.
[832.17s -> 834.73s]  You have an app that you load up on your phone
[836.36s -> 837.96s]  or on your iPad or whatever.
[837.96s -> 841.19s]  Whatever, doesn't matter.
[841.19s -> 844.39s]  And you have to escape from like the circus.
[845.78s -> 846.98s]  I have three of them.
[846.98s -> 851.38s]  There are like many little
[851.38s -> 853.22s]  hour to two hour long board games.
[853.22s -> 853.94s]  I have three of them.
[855.02s -> 857.18s]  I've got escape from the dinosaurs,
[857.74s -> 862.60s]  escape from the clowns, and then the wild west.
[862.60s -> 865.53s]  We're doing that after E3.
[865.53s -> 867.61s]  I'm glad we could have this conversation.
[867.61s -> 868.97s]  I'm glad, hey, I'm glad to be back.
[869.99s -> 870.55s]  Let's start.
[871.54s -> 874.02s]  Sam and Max, we're gonna clean up some stuff.
[874.02s -> 876.50s]  Sam and Max, last episode of season two.
[876.50s -> 879.78s]  That only took me 14 minutes.
[879.78s -> 880.74s]  That's it.
[880.74s -> 881.46s]  Check your watch.
[882.26s -> 883.80s]  Welcome guys.
[883.80s -> 884.52s]  Here we go.
[884.52s -> 919.05s]  I just make sure you are ready.
[919.05s -> 920.17s]  Some people may have been in the bathroom.
[920.57s -> 923.34s]  Oh, wow.
[926.62s -> 927.34s]  This is called.
[928.14s -> 930.54s]  Ooh, it's not what that's called.
[931.26s -> 937.61s]  Spaceship will self-destruct in three, two, one.
[938.49s -> 939.85s]  Spaceship destroyed,
[940.65s -> 943.13s]  but I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
[943.13s -> 944.89s]  and confidence in the mission.
[944.89s -> 946.89s]  Looks like we escaped that horrible explosion.
[947.77s -> 948.49s]  The nick of time.
[949.13s -> 950.01s]  You okay, Max?
[950.81s -> 953.05s]  I don't feel disintegrated.
[953.05s -> 954.81s]  You know more than usual,
[954.81s -> 956.97s]  but it felt like landing on a boiled ham.
[956.97s -> 957.29s]  Oops.
[957.93s -> 959.05s]  Sorry, Mr. Featherly.
[959.05s -> 959.93s]  I forgot you were in there.
[959.93s -> 960.73s]  The indignity.
[960.73s -> 961.77s]  Dude, these are the only characters
[961.77s -> 962.81s]  that get to stick around.
[962.81s -> 964.97s]  Why on earth have you brought me here?
[964.97s -> 966.73s]  Do you recognize this place?
[966.73s -> 969.45s]  Does no one study the classics anymore?
[971.54s -> 972.34s]  Farewell.
[972.34s -> 974.74s]  We're obviously in the eternal twilight
[974.74s -> 976.18s]  at the banks of the River Styx.
[976.98s -> 978.58s]  The land of the dead.
[979.54s -> 980.82s]  The land of the dead.
[980.82s -> 982.74s]  All the coolest people are dead.
[982.74s -> 984.74s]  I should have brought my autograph book.
[984.74s -> 987.30s]  Well, you've delivered Bosco to his final rest,
[987.30s -> 989.38s]  so let's be off, shall we?
[989.38s -> 990.02s]  Come on.
[990.02s -> 992.34s]  We can't just leave Bosco here.
[992.34s -> 995.38s]  Yeah, we should at least staple a note to him or something.
[995.38s -> 997.46s]  No, we're gonna have to find Bosco's soul
[997.46s -> 998.82s]  and get it back into his body.
[999.38s -> 1000.18s]  Find Bosco's soul.
[1000.18s -> 1002.66s]  You the peace and quiet was too good to last.
[1002.66s -> 1005.22s]  Final episode, season two, episode five.
[1007.13s -> 1011.13s]  It's titled Beaselbub.
[1011.13s -> 1012.09s]  I don't know, something like that.
[1012.09s -> 1014.33s]  Anyways, what are these moles doing here?
[1014.97s -> 1017.16s]  Do I have any items from the last adventure?
[1017.16s -> 1018.12s]  Federal related egg.
[1018.12s -> 1018.92s]  Don't ask me how.
[1019.72s -> 1021.14s]  So I have an egg.
[1021.14s -> 1022.02s]  We have the cake sample.
[1022.02s -> 1024.18s]  By the way, if you missed last time that I played this,
[1025.14s -> 1028.52s]  there were aliens and we got like sucked into a spaceship
[1028.52s -> 1030.60s]  and then we got sucked into this wormhole
[1030.60s -> 1031.56s]  and now we're all dead.
[1032.44s -> 1033.16s]  I think.
[1033.16s -> 1033.56s]  I don't know.
[1033.56s -> 1034.52s]  I haven't read the manga.
[1035.32s -> 1039.16s]  The AI isn't useful on creatures with natural intelligence.
[1040.20s -> 1041.88s]  Okay, so we gotta get Bosco's soul.
[1042.60s -> 1043.64s]  Poor Bosco.
[1043.64s -> 1045.80s]  The shock of seeing time-traveling mariachis
[1045.80s -> 1047.56s]  was too much for his heart to take.
[1047.56s -> 1050.52s]  Stress-induced heart attacks are the second most common cause of death
[1050.52s -> 1053.08s]  for conspiracy freaks obsessed with alien abduction.
[1053.08s -> 1054.28s]  What's the first?
[1054.28s -> 1056.60s]  Unexplained organ removal.
[1056.60s -> 1057.32s]  Well, this moment.
[1058.92s -> 1059.88s]  I need to like bring this up.
[1061.51s -> 1062.87s]  This like cut off a little bit for me.
[1064.33s -> 1066.25s]  I can't stream under these conditions.
[1068.22s -> 1069.10s]  I'll see you next week, guys.
[1069.66s -> 1071.26s]  Maybe like a couple months.
[1071.26s -> 1072.14s]  Once I like get over.
[1072.86s -> 1075.58s]  This is what happens to babies that get thrown out with the bath water.
[1077.16s -> 1077.40s]  Bye.
[1079.27s -> 1080.71s]  Okay, so let's talk about them.
[1080.71s -> 1082.71s]  All those times on the mariachi spaceship
[1082.71s -> 1084.95s]  when you saw only one set of footprints.
[1084.95s -> 1086.47s]  That was when I carried you.
[1086.47s -> 1088.39s]  Oh, for heaven's sake.
[1089.59s -> 1092.31s]  All right.
[1092.31s -> 1093.51s]  Can I run for rent?
[1094.23s -> 1096.07s]  Bookstore game cartridges.
[1096.07s -> 1096.95s]  What the hell is this?
[1097.59s -> 1098.23s]  Is this ET?
[1098.23s -> 1099.43s]  I heard rumors about a company
[1099.43s -> 1101.67s]  burying millions of mime sweeper cartridges.
[1101.67s -> 1103.59s]  But I always thought that was in the desert.
[1103.59s -> 1105.59s]  I bet the sand worms carried them here.
[1105.59s -> 1108.39s]  I think it was actually in the desert in Nevada.
[1109.19s -> 1110.15s]  I actually think that's true.
[1110.95s -> 1113.83s]  Looks like the bottom dropped out of the Esperanto literature business.
[1116.68s -> 1119.16s]  Harry karaoke machine and gumball machine.
[1119.16s -> 1122.14s]  Oh, it's the gumball machine from upstairs.
[1122.14s -> 1122.78s]  Ball machine.
[1122.78s -> 1124.06s]  We've been missing.
[1124.06s -> 1126.38s]  Oh, I wouldn't say we've been missing it.
[1128.58s -> 1129.46s]  Let's talk to Harry.
[1129.46s -> 1131.38s]  Oh, cute Max.
[1131.38s -> 1133.14s]  It's a little goth mole man.
[1133.78s -> 1138.10s]  So can he dig stream.
[1138.10s -> 1141.22s]  So now we're under representing the mole man demographic.
[1141.22s -> 1143.94s]  I thought we were just insensitive to women and minorities.
[1144.50s -> 1146.34s]  No, you need a token.
[1146.34s -> 1148.42s]  You've ruined my big entrance.
[1148.98s -> 1151.06s]  Wait, Harry mole man?
[1151.70s -> 1153.06s]  In a past life, yes.
[1153.94s -> 1155.86s]  Now I am become deaf.
[1156.95s -> 1159.43s]  Okay, let us on the train.
[1159.43s -> 1160.31s]  What are you doing here?
[1160.31s -> 1161.27s]  Where's Bosco's soul?
[1161.27s -> 1163.91s]  Have you seen Bosco's soul lying around anywhere?
[1163.91s -> 1164.55s]  Bosco.
[1166.07s -> 1166.71s]  Bosco.
[1167.67s -> 1170.07s]  Is that his first or last name?
[1170.07s -> 1171.27s]  We never asked.
[1172.07s -> 1174.07s]  Just do two palms up.
[1177.19s -> 1178.87s]  Center of left shoulder.
[1178.87s -> 1180.31s]  Center of right shoulder.
[1180.31s -> 1180.95s]  Two palms up.
[1180.95s -> 1181.83s]  Center of left shoulder.
[1181.83s -> 1182.71s]  Center of right shoulder.
[1183.27s -> 1187.67s]  Push as hard as you fucking can lunging forward into the acid.
[1192.36s -> 1193.72s]  Guaranteed to fall over.
[1193.72s -> 1197.80s]  What do you mean what?
[1203.29s -> 1203.53s]  What?
[1203.53s -> 1204.01s]  What's wrong?
[1205.37s -> 1206.33s]  There's something wrong with that.
[1206.33s -> 1211.21s]  But he's still sedated.
[1211.21s -> 1212.01s]  Oh, hold on.
[1212.49s -> 1213.69s]  I got like a funny story.
[1214.63s -> 1215.35s]  I got a funny...
[1215.35s -> 1216.95s]  Oh, he was sedated story.
[1216.95s -> 1217.67s]  Well, not really.
[1217.67s -> 1219.51s]  I was like really polite and really nice.
[1221.51s -> 1223.11s]  But so Talix picked me up
[1224.79s -> 1227.75s]  because you have to have somebody drive you there.
[1227.75s -> 1230.47s]  You can't drive because obviously for very obvious reasons.
[1231.03s -> 1234.63s]  So when he came to get me into the, you know, the recovery room,
[1235.19s -> 1236.23s]  he overheard.
[1236.23s -> 1238.15s]  I mean, I remember this, but I kind of don't.
[1238.79s -> 1242.55s]  But he overheard me talking to the nurses.
[1243.27s -> 1245.99s]  And I was saying some strange things.
[1246.55s -> 1247.59s]  Not really that strange.
[1247.59s -> 1252.71s]  But apparently I got up and was putting on my shoes and falling down
[1252.71s -> 1255.43s]  and like falling forward and almost like hitting my head on the wall.
[1255.43s -> 1257.11s]  Putting my shoes on and the nurse was like,
[1257.11s -> 1258.79s]  Hey, hey, sit down, sit down.
[1258.79s -> 1260.31s]  And apparently I looked at her and I went,
[1260.31s -> 1261.27s]  Hey, don't worry.
[1261.27s -> 1264.63s]  This ain't my first rodeo.
[1264.63s -> 1265.27s]  I don't know.
[1265.27s -> 1268.25s]  Like as in, as in what?
[1268.25s -> 1270.33s]  Like as in I do drugs all the time.
[1271.69s -> 1272.49s]  I was like, no, don't worry.
[1272.49s -> 1273.61s]  It's ain't my first rodeo.
[1273.61s -> 1274.57s]  I got this.
[1274.57s -> 1275.93s]  And then I like announced to everybody.
[1275.93s -> 1278.49s]  I was, I said like, like five times.
[1278.49s -> 1280.65s]  I was supposed to say, you guys are pros.
[1280.65s -> 1282.25s]  You guys are pros.
[1282.25s -> 1282.89s]  All of you.
[1282.89s -> 1283.37s]  Thank you.
[1283.37s -> 1283.69s]  All of you.
[1283.69s -> 1284.81s]  You're all pros.
[1284.81s -> 1287.61s]  Tell the doctor that he's a pro.
[1287.61s -> 1288.89s]  And they're like, yeah, yeah, we will.
[1288.89s -> 1289.21s]  Thank you.
[1289.21s -> 1290.97s]  And all I remember is like, yeah,
[1290.97s -> 1294.41s]  there's like Talix holding my arm and like walking with me,
[1294.41s -> 1295.61s]  like step by step.
[1295.61s -> 1298.17s]  And I'm just like, tell everybody in the office that they're pros.
[1302.74s -> 1305.46s]  And then we were driving on like the road.
[1306.10s -> 1307.14s]  I felt like we would.
[1307.14s -> 1308.98s]  I didn't, I didn't actually feel like this,
[1309.62s -> 1310.74s]  but I said like, oh cool.
[1310.74s -> 1314.18s]  We're like going through space because the lines on the road going down.
[1315.06s -> 1316.66s]  I knew we were on a road.
[1316.66s -> 1317.94s]  I wasn't like stupid.
[1318.74s -> 1320.49s]  It was the lines on the road.
[1320.49s -> 1322.17s]  You know, like Star Wars and they go to hyperspace
[1322.17s -> 1324.25s]  and like the, the lines come forward.
[1325.69s -> 1327.21s]  I wasn't, I didn't actually believe that.
[1327.21s -> 1329.29s]  I was just drugged up saying words.
[1329.29s -> 1330.49s]  Anyways, that's the funny.
[1330.49s -> 1332.25s]  Look what happened to me when I was on drug story.
[1339.86s -> 1343.14s]  Your final stop depends on what's in your permanent record.
[1343.14s -> 1346.02s]  But if you two are trying to get to hell,
[1346.02s -> 1347.94s]  that really shouldn't be a problem.
[1355.10s -> 1357.66s]  Can you imagine if I had gone forward to put my shoes on it?
[1357.66s -> 1360.38s]  I'm like, I went like this, you know, when you,
[1361.10s -> 1362.46s]  you're going to laugh at me, but I don't care.
[1363.27s -> 1365.35s]  So, you know, when you put your shoes on
[1365.35s -> 1368.87s]  and you lean forward to like pull the last of the latch up over your heel.
[1369.59s -> 1372.55s]  When I was doing that, I pulled too much and started to go forward.
[1372.55s -> 1374.39s]  Imagine if I just kept going forward
[1374.39s -> 1376.71s]  and like smashed my head through the drywall.
[1382.52s -> 1383.56s]  It's not a choker.
[1383.56s -> 1384.28s]  It's the ripped shirt.
[1384.28s -> 1385.32s]  I like this shirt.
[1385.32s -> 1387.48s]  It's a very sentimental value shirt.
[1387.48s -> 1388.84s]  What's that hair?
[1388.84s -> 1391.80s]  It's just, look, I'm, I'm in recovery.
[1391.80s -> 1392.30s]  Okay.
[1397.72s -> 1399.80s]  Don't get me too, don't get me too hot right now.
[1399.80s -> 1400.84s]  I'm not supposed to get stressed.
[1409.16s -> 1415.91s]  Okay.
[1415.91s -> 1418.15s]  I really like probably shouldn't be laughing.
[1418.15s -> 1419.83s]  No more like funny things.
[1419.83s -> 1421.67s]  Don't say anything funny because like I,
[1421.67s -> 1423.75s]  I really think I'm supposed to like take it easy down here.
[1424.63s -> 1426.71s]  So I'm not going to, I'm not making any more,
[1426.71s -> 1428.31s]  I'm not going to laugh at anything and no one,
[1428.31s -> 1430.23s]  no one in the chat is going to make any funny things.
[1431.19s -> 1432.63s]  Okay. Let me be serious.
[1437.11s -> 1437.83s]  Okay. So we have to die.
[1442.63s -> 1452.31s]  So we have to die.
[1460.17s -> 1461.29s]  Are you allowed to get angry?
[1461.29s -> 1462.41s]  No, no, no, no emotions.
[1462.41s -> 1464.01s]  I have to be like emotionless.
[1464.01s -> 1465.45s]  Why do you think I've been playing Hearthstone?
[1466.33s -> 1467.69s]  Cause that's emotionless.
[1467.69s -> 1470.57s]  I just sit there with like my fucking eyes wide open,
[1470.57s -> 1474.14s]  just staring and I hear the guy go like,
[1474.22s -> 1478.84s]  Uther versus Carl Drago.
[1478.84s -> 1480.12s]  I don't even need to think.
[1480.12s -> 1480.76s]  It doesn't matter.
[1488.15s -> 1489.75s]  There's so many people in that game now.
[1491.35s -> 1492.71s]  Did somebody just give community subs?
[1494.38s -> 1495.90s]  Dermal lied about the clown car.
[1495.90s -> 1497.34s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[1509.50s -> 1510.70s]  So they're just right above hell.
[1511.50s -> 1512.62s]  It's just in the sewer.
[1515.56s -> 1517.32s]  Okay. Well, wait, what?
[1517.32s -> 1519.08s]  Mama Bosco's ghost?
[1519.08s -> 1520.84s]  Mrs. Mama Bosco?
[1520.84s -> 1522.92s]  That's Ms. Mama Bosco.
[1523.72s -> 1524.92s]  You think just cause I'm dead,
[1524.92s -> 1526.92s]  you don't have to respect my independence?
[1526.92s -> 1528.20s]  How'd you get to be a ghost?
[1528.20s -> 1529.72s]  Disable pop-up notifications.
[1530.52s -> 1531.24s]  It doesn't matter.
[1532.28s -> 1533.72s]  My steam is broken, guys.
[1533.72s -> 1534.68s]  Do you understand?
[1534.68s -> 1537.64s]  I don't remember hearing or causing an explosion.
[1537.64s -> 1540.68s]  It was a great big geyser of vinegar and baking soda.
[1541.64s -> 1543.66s]  Let me give you a quick little story.
[1543.66s -> 1546.22s]  I've dis- I disabled my steam notifications
[1547.02s -> 1549.69s]  like seven years ago.
[1549.69s -> 1550.65s]  I've done everything.
[1550.65s -> 1551.77s]  I've turned off everything.
[1551.77s -> 1552.41s]  It doesn't matter.
[1552.41s -> 1554.49s]  I have so many broken notifications
[1555.29s -> 1557.93s]  for like the 5,000 invites that I've gotten
[1557.93s -> 1559.93s]  over the last like almost decade.
[1560.65s -> 1561.53s]  I can't turn them off,
[1562.33s -> 1568.47s]  but I think I can do this though.
[1569.03s -> 1570.95s]  Damn it.
[1570.95s -> 1571.83s]  What the fuck?
[1571.83s -> 1576.73s]  I'm not even logged into steam.
[1577.45s -> 1583.74s]  I'm not even fucking logged in.
[1586.09s -> 1588.17s]  I am not even logged into steam.
[1590.26s -> 1591.94s]  I'm not like on my friends.
[1591.94s -> 1598.34s]  I'm in- I'm disconnected right now.
[1598.34s -> 1599.70s]  Like disconnected as in I'm not-
[1599.70s -> 1602.50s]  I'm still on my steam library like in my store,
[1602.50s -> 1603.30s]  but I'm not-
[1603.30s -> 1605.22s]  Why am I getting notifications?
[1605.22s -> 1610.18s]  I'm not supposed to-
[1610.18s -> 1611.54s]  I'm supposed to stay low stress.
[1612.18s -> 1619.29s]  It's the Tuesday maintenance.
[1626.06s -> 1630.82s]  No, that's the wrong button.
[1630.82s -> 1632.34s]  Why is that showing up?
[1634.31s -> 1634.95s]  Hold on.
[1634.95s -> 1635.43s]  Hold on.
[1635.43s -> 1635.75s]  Hold on.
[1636.71s -> 1637.21s]  What?
[1637.75s -> 1638.31s]  I gotta get-
[1638.31s -> 1638.87s]  I gotta-
[1638.87s -> 1639.37s]  Hold on.
[1640.26s -> 1644.81s]  If I just exit out of steam,
[1644.81s -> 1647.29s]  I'm gonna be able to stay in Sam and Max, right?
[1647.29s -> 1649.45s]  Like if I just physically exit steam,
[1649.45s -> 1658.89s]  that's not gonna kick me out, right?
[1658.89s -> 1659.53s]  Stop shouting.
[1659.53s -> 1659.85s]  I'm sorry.
[1659.85s -> 1660.73s]  I'm sorry.
[1660.73s -> 1661.61s]  Will it kick me out?
[1661.61s -> 1662.73s]  What the fuck?
[1662.73s -> 1665.75s]  Why am I getting notifications
[1665.75s -> 1667.27s]  that I'm not even logged into steam?
[1667.91s -> 1673.80s]  Oh, stress levels are getting fucking high.
[1673.80s -> 1674.20s]  Hold on.
[1674.20s -> 1674.60s]  Don't-
[1674.60s -> 1675.56s]  Oh, I ain't going in-
[1675.56s -> 1675.88s]  Hold on.
[1675.88s -> 1676.28s]  Hold on.
[1676.28s -> 1676.36s]  Hold on.
[1676.36s -> 1677.08s]  Let me save this.
[1678.30s -> 1680.06s]  All my fucking notifications are off.
[1681.42s -> 1684.06s]  Steam, why can't you just let me never have them?
[1684.78s -> 1685.52s]  Oh.
[1686.08s -> 1691.95s]  Okay, I'm gonna-
[1691.95s -> 1695.05s]  Let me just exit steam.
[1695.05s -> 1695.85s]  God damn it.
[1695.85s -> 1697.37s]  It is exiting Sam and Max.
[1699.72s -> 1701.08s]  Fucking technology, man.
[1703.63s -> 1706.49s]  I saved it, though.
[1706.49s -> 1708.09s]  All right, so somebody explain to me again
[1708.09s -> 1710.81s]  why while I'm not even logged into friends
[1710.81s -> 1711.93s]  or signed into steams,
[1711.93s -> 1712.65s]  like friends and chat,
[1712.65s -> 1714.09s]  that I'm still getting fucking notifications.
[1715.53s -> 1716.01s]  What is that?
[1716.65s -> 1717.37s]  Why is that happening?
[1724.73s -> 1726.01s]  I can't do game capture.
[1726.01s -> 1729.24s]  You cannot game capture this game.
[1729.24s -> 1730.76s]  I'm in offline mode.
[1731.32s -> 1732.20s]  I'm disconnect-
[1732.20s -> 1741.20s]  I'm not online.
[1741.20s -> 1742.48s]  Why would I be getting notifications?
[1743.04s -> 1749.37s]  Whatever.
[1749.37s -> 1749.93s]  I'm-
[1749.93s -> 1750.57s]  We'll try it again.
[1756.48s -> 1758.64s]  Thank you, staff.
[1758.64s -> 1759.68s]  Thank you, Skeletor.
[1759.68s -> 1761.84s]  Daff Skeletor for the five community subs.
[1761.84s -> 1763.98s]  Should have gotten the GOG version.
[1763.98s -> 1764.78s]  You wanna know what else is really-
[1764.78s -> 1765.02s]  You wanna-
[1765.02s -> 1765.98s]  Like, you wanna be like,
[1765.98s -> 1767.26s]  let me just shit talk steam for a second.
[1767.26s -> 1769.95s]  You know what else is really dumb?
[1769.95s -> 1770.75s]  Did you guys know
[1771.98s -> 1774.06s]  that you cannot delete a steam group?
[1778.14s -> 1779.58s]  You can't delete a steam group.
[1780.84s -> 1782.68s]  It has to get to zero members.
[1785.93s -> 1788.89s]  If your steam group does not have zero members,
[1788.89s -> 1793.36s]  it cannot be deleted.
[1793.36s -> 1793.86s]  Why?
[1797.05s -> 1798.57s]  And why am I getting-
[1799.72s -> 1800.76s]  I'm gonna scream here,
[1800.76s -> 1802.20s]  but just pretend I'm screaming.
[1802.20s -> 1805.32s]  Notifications when I'm not even fucking logged into steam
[1805.96s -> 1809.40s]  and when I'm not even fucking connected to the friends account.
[1809.40s -> 1811.08s]  I'm offline mode
[1811.08s -> 1814.12s]  and I've had notifications turned off for 10 fucking years.
[1814.68s -> 1816.84s]  Why are you still showing me notifications?
[1817.64s -> 1819.72s]  I don't want any notifications.
[1819.72s -> 1820.60s]  I'm going really low here.
[1820.60s -> 1821.48s]  Okay, let's do this back.
[1821.48s -> 1822.36s]  Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[1823.16s -> 1829.85s]  Back to what we were doing.
[1832.96s -> 1833.68s]  Wait a second.
[1833.68s -> 1835.44s]  Where is your apartment exactly?
[1835.44s -> 1838.00s]  On the second floor above the store, fool.
[1838.00s -> 1839.04s]  Where else would I live?
[1841.02s -> 1842.78s]  Put something over on the bottom, right?
[1842.78s -> 1845.58s]  Yeah, I'm gonna put like steam sucks down there.
[1846.14s -> 1869.56s]  No, it's gotta be like a square.
[1869.56s -> 1872.91s]  I'm just gonna make a black square.
[1872.91s -> 1873.87s]  No, who cares?
[1873.87s -> 1874.59s]  All right, I'm just-
[1874.59s -> 1875.31s]  Here we go.
[1875.31s -> 1880.54s]  How do we get to your apartment?
[1880.54s -> 1881.58s]  Hell if I know.
[1881.58s -> 1883.02s]  Some fool blew up the stairs.
[1883.58s -> 1887.18s]  Somebody blew up the stairs.
[1888.27s -> 1889.87s]  How do we get to your apartment?
[1889.87s -> 1890.91s]  Hell if I know.
[1890.91s -> 1892.35s]  Some fool blew up the stairs.
[1893.15s -> 1894.54s]  Okay, how do we get up there?
[1894.54s -> 1896.14s]  How do we get to your apartment?
[1896.14s -> 1897.18s]  Hell if I know.
[1897.18s -> 1898.78s]  Some fool blew up the stairs.
[1898.78s -> 1900.62s]  Okay, some fool blew up the stairs.
[1900.62s -> 1903.02s]  Wasn't somebody there to guide you to the afterlife?
[1903.02s -> 1904.14s]  There was some little man
[1904.14s -> 1907.02s]  who kept going on about a token and some train,
[1907.02s -> 1908.94s]  but the second explosion scared him off.
[1908.94s -> 1909.90s]  That was Jerma last year
[1909.90s -> 1911.26s]  when he was talking about cryptocurrency.
[1911.26s -> 1912.70s]  And I can't get up there to get that token.
[1912.70s -> 1913.90s]  Get on the crypto train.
[1915.02s -> 1921.60s]  Okay, say it again.
[1921.60s -> 1923.60s]  Did you get a token for the afterlife?
[1923.60s -> 1925.76s]  I told you, it's still up in my apartment.
[1926.48s -> 1929.02s]  Okay, so we have to get up to Mamaboska's apartment.
[1929.66s -> 1931.02s]  Sorry for your loss.
[1931.02s -> 1933.26s]  Any final arrangements you want us to take care of?
[1933.26s -> 1935.58s]  Oh, I ain't going anywhere yet.
[1935.58s -> 1937.50s]  Even if I could get to the afterlife,
[1937.50s -> 1941.10s]  I can't rest until I find the man who trashed my store.
[1941.10s -> 1941.58s]  That was awesome.
[1941.58s -> 1943.18s]  That was over 40 years ago.
[1943.98s -> 1946.38s]  Wow, she really holds a grudge.
[1946.38s -> 1948.06s]  I'm glad I broke up with her.
[1948.06s -> 1949.98s]  I spent the last 40 years
[1949.98s -> 1952.62s]  thinking of new ways to make his life a living hell.
[1952.62s -> 1954.14s]  But then she says things like that,
[1954.14s -> 1955.98s]  which makes me love her even more.
[1957.98s -> 1959.02s]  All right, we got to get that token.
[1959.02s -> 1960.06s]  Rest in peace, Ms. Bosco.
[1960.22s -> 1961.26s]  I also have to fix this
[1961.26s -> 1962.38s]  because this is going to drive me crazy
[1962.38s -> 1963.18s]  for the rest of the stream.
[1963.18s -> 1965.10s]  I know some people are already being driven crazy.
[1965.90s -> 1966.46s]  Here we go.
[1967.84s -> 1969.12s]  The black bar is gone.
[1969.76s -> 1972.80s]  I'm, I can, I'm, look, I'm hearing your feedback
[1973.36s -> 1974.88s]  and I'm putting your feedback into place.
[1975.60s -> 1977.92s]  Anytime somebody says a piece of feedback,
[1977.92s -> 1978.64s]  I always hear it.
[1979.44s -> 1980.96s]  All right, can we go in here?
[1981.92s -> 1983.55s]  Hiya, Flint.
[1983.55s -> 1984.11s]  What's shaking?
[1984.11s -> 1984.51s]  What the fuck?
[1984.51s -> 1985.39s]  Can't talk, fellas.
[1985.39s -> 1987.47s]  I'm still waiting for Bosco to get back.
[1987.47s -> 1989.47s]  Oh, we already found Bosco.
[1989.47s -> 1992.27s]  Yeah, his corpse is already decaying down in the sewer.
[1992.27s -> 1994.03s]  Hey, that's cute, little pals.
[1994.03s -> 1996.19s]  But I got a 40-year-old case to wrap up here.
[1997.63s -> 1997.95s]  Okay.
[2001.47s -> 2002.75s]  All right, we got to go look in crack.
[2002.75s -> 2004.19s]  Ooh, it's getting hot down there.
[2005.31s -> 2007.47s]  So that's where the Esperanto bookstore went.
[2008.27s -> 2009.15s]  He doesn't know.
[2009.15s -> 2010.03s]  What do I not know?
[2015.60s -> 2016.32s]  Don't freak me out.
[2016.32s -> 2017.20s]  My stress levels.
[2017.20s -> 2017.92s]  It's a rock.
[2020.43s -> 2021.15s]  It's a rock.
[2022.86s -> 2023.90s]  MameTron9000.
[2023.90s -> 2025.26s]  All right, can we finally do something with this?
[2025.26s -> 2026.14s]  Jimmy2cheese.
[2026.14s -> 2027.26s]  Spent the whole season looking at it.
[2027.26s -> 2028.62s]  I haven't seen much of you lately.
[2028.62s -> 2029.34s]  Yeah?
[2029.34s -> 2031.42s]  Well, I got an image to maintain.
[2031.42s -> 2033.90s]  Can't be seen with you, lowlifes.
[2033.90s -> 2035.74s]  You know, that's a lot of attitude for somebody
[2035.74s -> 2037.58s]  we first met crawling up our toilet.
[2039.34s -> 2043.50s]  I'm building a child-friendly resort destination here.
[2043.50s -> 2045.58s]  Is the MameTron coming back to life?
[2045.58s -> 2047.42s]  Nah, he's brain dead.
[2047.42s -> 2050.38s]  We're turning him into a fantastic laser light show.
[2050.38s -> 2051.74s]  You know, for the kids.
[2053.58s -> 2055.10s]  Something about this is really sad.
[2056.06s -> 2057.10s]  This is really sad.
[2058.06s -> 2061.56s]  Oh, casino?
[2062.20s -> 2065.58s]  I thought that said to Lucky Vegan.
[2066.30s -> 2068.30s]  I was like, why is that the name of your casino?
[2069.02s -> 2077.68s]  Stop letting your emotions get to you, Jeremy.
[2077.68s -> 2078.72s]  They make you weak.
[2078.72s -> 2079.28s]  Weave them out.
[2085.12s -> 2087.36s]  What like a Sith thing to say?
[2088.32s -> 2094.41s]  What like a nice evil corporation way to see things.
[2095.05s -> 2096.41s]  All right, we got to get up to that apartment.
[2097.05s -> 2099.15s]  Let's go into symbols.
[2100.27s -> 2105.53s]  That's a Jedi thing.
[2107.26s -> 2111.28s]  No, Jedi is a balance of the force, right?
[2112.40s -> 2114.64s]  Sith is absolute.
[2130.40s -> 2131.36s]  That's a Jedi thing.
[2137.28s -> 2147.84s]  It's about emotions and being in touch with your emotions
[2147.84s -> 2150.40s]  and Jedi about locking and blocking your emotions out.
[2151.60s -> 2164.03s]  What the fuck?
[2164.03s -> 2164.67s]  Yeah, yeah.
[2165.84s -> 2166.08s]  Huh.
[2168.70s -> 2171.42s]  Well, that's why I like you need a balance in the force.
[2172.14s -> 2175.32s]  How you doing, gruesome?
[2175.32s -> 2177.88s]  What have you been doing since you confessed your love for Sybil
[2177.88s -> 2179.32s]  and she turned you down?
[2179.32s -> 2182.44s]  Mostly just replaying that moment in my mind.
[2183.08s -> 2185.08s]  Over and over again.
[2185.88s -> 2189.32s]  Hey, monster, which color do you think Abe would look best in?
[2189.32s -> 2189.64s]  Stop.
[2190.84s -> 2191.56s]  Maroon.
[2196.84s -> 2200.12s]  I have so much Star Wars merchandise, but here's the thing.
[2200.12s -> 2204.28s]  Listen, guys, most of the Star Wars merchandise that I have
[2204.84s -> 2208.52s]  was like random Christmas gifts, okay?
[2209.77s -> 2212.09s]  It was like Christmas presents.
[2212.81s -> 2215.05s]  Oh, look, the new Star Wars is coming out.
[2215.05s -> 2216.73s]  Here's five t-shirts.
[2217.21s -> 2217.93s]  Okay, I guess.
[2218.49s -> 2219.29s]  And they're comfortable.
[2223.36s -> 2226.00s]  I have like 30 Star Wars t-shirts.
[2226.00s -> 2228.32s]  Not because I think Star Wars is the best thing I've ever seen
[2228.32s -> 2233.12s]  is because, you know, like Trekkies to infinity and beyond, right?
[2233.12s -> 2234.24s]  I'm a Trekkie.
[2234.80s -> 2239.04s]  I don't like Star Wars, but because I get them as gifts.
[2239.76s -> 2241.74s]  Hi, Sybil.
[2241.74s -> 2243.74s]  I don't have much time to chat, Sam.
[2243.74s -> 2245.34s]  I've got so much to plan.
[2246.06s -> 2247.95s]  All right, let's be in the wedding.
[2247.95s -> 2250.03s]  Is there room in the wedding party for Max and me?
[2250.11s -> 2253.55s]  As president of the U.S. and high priest of the ocean chimps,
[2253.55s -> 2257.23s]  I'm qualified both legally and spiritually to conduct the ceremony.
[2258.11s -> 2259.47s]  How to put this tactfully?
[2260.11s -> 2262.43s]  They'll be serving ice cream in hell before I let them-
[2262.43s -> 2263.87s]  They do serve ice cream in hell.
[2263.87s -> 2264.67s]  Oh, come on.
[2266.20s -> 2267.24s]  Vanilla's my favorite.
[2267.24s -> 2270.12s]  Like, you had a perfect opportunity for a hysterical joke.
[2270.12s -> 2271.40s]  I'm able to consult, by the way.
[2276.32s -> 2277.92s]  What's the wedding gonna be like?
[2277.92s -> 2279.44s]  Is it a shotgun wedding?
[2279.44s -> 2281.20s]  Max, what a thing to ask.
[2281.84s -> 2284.48s]  Oh, wait, he doesn't know what that means, does he?
[2284.88s -> 2287.76s]  Just let him enjoy his fantasy version for a while.
[2287.76s -> 2294.16s]  Did we accidentally leave our monster in here?
[2294.16s -> 2295.60s]  We just left him here and she left him here?
[2295.60s -> 2296.48s]  We're gonna have to get a leash.
[2296.48s -> 2298.16s]  Back in the trunk, gruesome!
[2298.16s -> 2299.36s]  Don't you dare take him away.
[2299.36s -> 2300.00s]  Stop this!
[2300.00s -> 2303.76s]  I've been spilling all the details of my whirlwind romance with Abe.
[2303.76s -> 2304.96s]  I'm getting really emotional.
[2304.96s -> 2306.56s]  You're fucking with my Sith mentality.
[2306.56s -> 2308.96s]  Why am I made to suffer so?
[2313.84s -> 2314.96s]  Okay, well, that's bad.
[2319.18s -> 2321.50s]  Did we accidentally leave our monster in here?
[2321.50s -> 2322.86s]  Don't you dare take him away.
[2324.88s -> 2325.36s]  Okay, so...
[2326.08s -> 2327.12s]  Good luck, Sybil.
[2328.88s -> 2329.60s]  Wedding stuff.
[2331.08s -> 2333.40s]  Snooty overpriced wedding invitations.
[2333.40s -> 2335.56s]  I still haven't gotten my invitation.
[2335.56s -> 2338.04s]  Strange, since the wedding's only hours away.
[2338.60s -> 2339.88s]  Lost in the mail, I'm sure.
[2341.58s -> 2342.46s]  I know what that's like.
[2343.77s -> 2344.89s]  I know what that's like.
[2344.89s -> 2345.85s]  Cake at a wedding?
[2346.65s -> 2347.37s]  Okay.
[2350.33s -> 2351.53s]  Uh, cake in the mail.
[2352.17s -> 2354.25s]  Enjoying all this quality time with Sybil?
[2354.25s -> 2356.09s]  Let me see this one more time.
[2356.09s -> 2358.33s]  It's so fucking horrible.
[2358.33s -> 2361.37s]  All right, let's go out the exit.
[2361.77s -> 2362.49s]  It's not... what?
[2363.13s -> 2363.85s]  Hey, it's open.
[2364.49s -> 2365.53s]  Just kidding.
[2365.53s -> 2366.49s]  Oh, I didn't do that.
[2366.49s -> 2366.81s]  Why?
[2368.25s -> 2369.93s]  Over like 12...
[2371.05s -> 2372.65s]  8 episodes, 9 episodes.
[2372.65s -> 2373.45s]  You're gonna do that to me?
[2375.98s -> 2376.48s]  Okay.
[2377.32s -> 2378.36s]  Anything else I can do?
[2378.36s -> 2379.08s]  What about the fox?
[2379.88s -> 2381.88s]  Sure, they talk about personality.
[2381.88s -> 2384.28s]  But Miss America always goes to the fox.
[2385.16s -> 2390.43s]  All right, we have egg, gun.
[2391.07s -> 2391.55s]  Let's just...
[2391.55s -> 2392.75s]  I want to go check out Stinky's.
[2393.39s -> 2399.82s]  Can I drive anywhere?
[2399.82s -> 2400.46s]  Well, hold on.
[2400.46s -> 2401.10s]  One thing at a time.
[2403.18s -> 2404.62s]  Hmm, they're closed.
[2404.62s -> 2405.12s]  Closed.
[2407.93s -> 2409.05s]  Hi, how are these guys doing?
[2409.05s -> 2411.29s]  Hello, and welcome to Pimplica.
[2414.28s -> 2417.00s]  Okay, um, got any car upgrades?
[2417.00s -> 2418.68s]  What car upgrades are you offering this time?
[2418.68s -> 2423.32s]  Turn your vehicle into a super fast, nitro-burning, funny car.
[2423.32s -> 2423.82s]  Funny car.
[2425.32s -> 2428.52s]  Offer in Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[2428.52s -> 2429.48s]  I like funny things.
[2429.48s -> 2432.04s]  Oh yeah, I can take that mother out on the street away,
[2432.04s -> 2434.28s]  push her to the red line until she screams,
[2434.28s -> 2436.52s]  pop the clutch, kick you the afterburners,
[2436.52s -> 2440.12s]  and smoke them pigs as I sail over the county line.
[2440.12s -> 2441.63s]  Whee!
[2441.63s -> 2443.07s]  You can't see over the wheel, Max.
[2443.63s -> 2444.13s]  Fascist.
[2446.75s -> 2448.35s]  Hey, Jerma lied about the clown car.
[2448.35s -> 2450.19s]  What a perfect opportunity for you to come in here.
[2450.99s -> 2453.07s]  Thanks to the five community subs.
[2453.07s -> 2453.79s]  Five more.
[2453.79s -> 2455.87s]  He gave more earlier, too.
[2455.87s -> 2456.59s]  Thank you so much.
[2458.33s -> 2458.83s]  Thank you.
[2460.68s -> 2461.32s]  What's wrong with the bluster?
[2461.32s -> 2464.92s]  Is it my imagination or is Bluster Blaster acting weirder than normal?
[2464.92s -> 2469.00s]  He suffered severe injuries while testing an experimental wireless
[2469.00s -> 2469.56s]  antenna.
[2471.24s -> 2475.00s]  You guys, you guys, I'm in so much pain right now.
[2475.88s -> 2479.48s]  We have been using laughing gas to keep him sedated.
[2479.48s -> 2482.60s]  I know what that's like, too, except not laughing gas.
[2482.60s -> 2484.36s]  Somebody says, how do I get a sub?
[2484.36s -> 2485.16s]  Now, how do I get one?
[2485.96s -> 2490.40s]  Well, you either wait till one of somebody in the community
[2490.40s -> 2495.36s]  graciously sends a community subs or it's $5.99.
[2495.36s -> 2496.00s]  That's not right.
[2496.00s -> 2497.20s]  It's $4.99.
[2497.20s -> 2498.72s]  Adding a dollar for no reason.
[2498.96s -> 2500.08s]  Last time I looked at that.
[2500.96s -> 2502.96s]  $5.99 for a sub.
[2502.96s -> 2504.40s]  It's actually $4.99.
[2508.20s -> 2509.64s]  I'm like scamming.
[2509.64s -> 2511.24s]  I have my own button down there.
[2512.20s -> 2513.56s]  That would be so fucked up.
[2518.72s -> 2519.92s]  It's $5.99.
[2521.23s -> 2523.39s]  We want that nitrous upgrade for our car.
[2523.39s -> 2526.67s]  I want to go fast enough to blow the stink off of Sam.
[2526.67s -> 2531.15s]  We're sorry, but your vehicle has gone on to a better place.
[2532.03s -> 2534.03s]  We are sorry for your loss.
[2534.59s -> 2535.95s]  Can't you fix it?
[2535.95s -> 2538.75s]  We're afraid the car is completely dead.
[2538.75s -> 2541.15s]  Repairing it is beyond our current skill level.
[2542.43s -> 2544.59s]  It still had so much to live for.
[2561.71s -> 2563.71s]  Can't you guys upgrade the DeSoto?
[2563.71s -> 2569.39s]  The nitrous speed upgrade is only for vehicles in working condition.
[2569.39s -> 2572.67s]  We're sorry, but your vehicle is completely dead.
[2574.35s -> 2577.23s]  Where are you guys getting enough nitrous to do car upgrades?
[2577.23s -> 2583.23s]  Blaster Blaster was given laughing gas to ease his suffering after his recent injury.
[2583.23s -> 2586.83s]  Wait, you've been selling the leftovers from his prescription?
[2586.83s -> 2589.79s]  And these guys are the only ones not going to hell.
[2591.23s -> 2592.51s]  The rest of his prescription.
[2593.47s -> 2594.83s]  So long, cops.
[2594.83s -> 2595.71s]  Stay virtuous.
[2598.08s -> 2599.36s]  Somebody just subscribed to Twitch Prime.
[2599.36s -> 2600.16s]  Thanks for the Twitch Prime.
[2604.41s -> 2611.60s]  Okay, so we need to I can't believe the DeSoto died.
[2611.60s -> 2612.64s]  I think I can do better than that.
[2612.64s -> 2615.04s]  I can do better like like streamer voice.
[2616.24s -> 2619.10s]  Hey, thanks for that Twitch Prime.
[2619.10s -> 2620.06s]  No, hey, thanks.
[2622.56s -> 2624.27s]  Hey, that's Twitch Prime, man.
[2624.27s -> 2625.47s]  Really appreciate it.
[2625.47s -> 2626.03s]  That was better.
[2626.03s -> 2627.07s]  I had to turn the volume down.
[2627.07s -> 2628.27s]  Didn't want to hurt anybody.
[2628.27s -> 2632.08s]  All right, let's go.
[2632.96s -> 2636.89s]  How the fuck do I get?
[2637.45s -> 2639.13s]  I need to like go to her apartment.
[2643.04s -> 2644.32s]  We can't get up there.
[2644.32s -> 2645.36s]  And where is her apartment?
[2646.00s -> 2647.28s]  The thing's blocking the way.
[2651.07s -> 2653.63s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2653.63s -> 2654.43s]  Ow, my stomach.
[2660.25s -> 2663.82s]  Hey, hey, buddy.
[2663.82s -> 2665.58s]  Throw us that remote control, would you?
[2668.38s -> 2669.42s]  You're gonna need this.
[2669.42s -> 2669.92s]  Wow.
[2670.86s -> 2671.74s]  Thanks, buddy.
[2671.74s -> 2672.70s]  Be you later.
[2672.70s -> 2673.90s]  What a perfect time loop.
[2674.62s -> 2675.90s]  What a perfect time loop.
[2676.54s -> 2679.79s]  So we have the remote control, the Boxing Betty remote.
[2681.20s -> 2682.24s]  Where's Boxing Betty?
[2687.84s -> 2688.72s]  Wasn't Boxing Betty...
[2690.32s -> 2691.20s]  Where was Boxing Betty?
[2691.20s -> 2691.76s]  In my closet?
[2692.56s -> 2694.73s]  I can't get up to the closet, though.
[2695.61s -> 2696.97s]  Well, oh, right, right, over here, over here.
[2697.85s -> 2702.68s]  Nobody gonna come in here.
[2702.68s -> 2703.48s]  I don't need to come in here.
[2703.48s -> 2705.08s]  I'm just gonna control from outside here.
[2705.08s -> 2705.58s]  Come on.
[2716.01s -> 2723.10s]  The remote won't do much good while he's dead.
[2724.14s -> 2724.64s]  He's dead.
[2725.90s -> 2726.40s]  Damn it.
[2728.19s -> 2729.15s]  What else could I control?
[2729.79s -> 2732.60s]  Is there any electronic device?
[2732.60s -> 2733.72s]  Maybe can I go in here?
[2733.72s -> 2734.92s]  Will he let me in here now?
[2735.64s -> 2738.20s]  How's the search going, Flint?
[2738.28s -> 2739.88s]  Still no sign of Bosco, fellas.
[2739.88s -> 2741.88s]  I'll let you know as soon as he shows up.
[2741.88s -> 2743.00s]  Maybe down in the sewer.
[2743.00s -> 2744.44s]  I don't think Flint's taking us seriously, Max.
[2744.44s -> 2747.40s]  If I were as cool as him, I wouldn't take us seriously either.
[2750.70s -> 2751.18s]  Is there something I can...
[2751.18s -> 2751.98s]  Let me check down here.
[2752.70s -> 2763.47s]  Can I talk to this person?
[2765.00s -> 2765.80s]  Hey, pal.
[2765.80s -> 2766.36s]  Can you?
[2766.36s -> 2767.40s]  Whoa, hey.
[2768.43s -> 2771.15s]  Yours really knows how to fill out a soul.
[2771.15s -> 2772.35s]  Well, I never.
[2773.23s -> 2774.91s]  No, that means you're fucking stacked.
[2775.71s -> 2779.87s]  When I was working out, and I started to wear tight,
[2780.67s -> 2781.79s]  extra-small shirts,
[2783.55s -> 2785.07s]  almost like if I moved the wrong way,
[2785.07s -> 2787.47s]  I would just pop out of them.
[2787.47s -> 2788.11s]  People would say,
[2788.11s -> 2789.47s]  man, you're really filling out shirts now.
[2789.47s -> 2790.11s]  And I'd be like, yeah.
[2791.42s -> 2793.90s]  But why does this shirt only come down to your belly button?
[2794.88s -> 2796.56s]  Oh, it's just, you know, it's a new style.
[2797.36s -> 2799.63s]  Okay, so...
[2800.27s -> 2803.05s]  No siree.
[2803.05s -> 2804.57s]  What about the karaoke machine?
[2804.57s -> 2805.21s]  Nothing doing.
[2805.77s -> 2806.41s]  Gumball machine?
[2807.42s -> 2808.06s]  Not happening.
[2808.62s -> 2809.18s]  Video games?
[2809.82s -> 2814.46s]  Can I control the video games?
[2815.10s -> 2815.60s]  Bosco.
[2816.14s -> 2818.54s]  No siree.
[2818.54s -> 2819.04s]  No.
[2819.50s -> 2821.80s]  The train?
[2821.80s -> 2823.08s]  Fuck, what do I do with this?
[2823.08s -> 2824.20s]  It's, I'm so close.
[2824.92s -> 2827.85s]  You've got to get Bosco's soul back.
[2827.85s -> 2828.65s]  I know, I know.
[2828.65s -> 2829.05s]  I'm trying.
[2829.05s -> 2830.17s]  What's the map say?
[2830.17s -> 2833.21s]  Why can't every belief system have a transit system this efficient?
[2834.17s -> 2838.67s]  The ego on this guy.
[2844.11s -> 2848.27s]  Guys, the only ego that I like has another G
[2849.87s -> 2852.81s]  and toasts up in a minute,
[2852.81s -> 2855.21s]  and you put butter and a little bit of cinnamon on it,
[2855.21s -> 2857.13s]  and it's great for breakfast.
[2857.13s -> 2858.97s]  I know that that was probably the worst thing you've heard
[2858.97s -> 2860.33s]  in like probably the last six months.
[2860.33s -> 2863.13s]  It was terrible, but I don't care.
[2863.13s -> 2865.69s]  If you saw that joke on like fucking ABC this morning,
[2866.41s -> 2867.93s]  like your parents would have laughed,
[2867.93s -> 2870.25s]  and that's all it matters is a laugh.
[2870.25s -> 2871.29s]  It doesn't matter where it comes from.
[2871.93s -> 2876.14s]  What about on you?
[2876.14s -> 2877.42s]  Can I control one of these guys?
[2880.57s -> 2881.53s]  No way.
[2881.53s -> 2882.89s]  I can't like do anything with this.
[2883.69s -> 2888.19s]  Not even your parents would have laughed.
[2888.19s -> 2889.55s]  I guarantee they would have.
[2889.55s -> 2891.47s]  If I call my grandmother right now,
[2891.47s -> 2893.15s]  and I make that same joke, she'll go...
[2895.15s -> 2896.27s]  No siree, delicious, yeah.
[2901.80s -> 2902.68s]  Guys, do you know how...
[2903.32s -> 2904.43s]  Never mind.
[2904.99s -> 2906.38s]  This is a thing.
[2907.44s -> 2909.20s]  No, I can't talk about this.
[2909.20s -> 2910.40s]  I'm not going to talk about this
[2910.40s -> 2913.28s]  because this is like a thing that I've wanted to do
[2913.28s -> 2915.60s]  for a very long time, and I haven't done it yet.
[2920.32s -> 2921.92s]  No, I can't because in case I do it,
[2921.92s -> 2922.40s]  it's going to...
[2922.40s -> 2923.60s]  It has to be done right,
[2923.60s -> 2925.12s]  and then no one can know about it.
[2925.12s -> 2926.08s]  What about Sybil's office?
[2926.64s -> 2928.44s]  The car?
[2929.08s -> 2941.76s]  Not happening.
[2941.76s -> 2942.88s]  Nothing in here I can do.
[2942.88s -> 2946.00s]  Well, no, have they left at this point?
[2946.72s -> 2947.20s]  Wait a minute.
[2947.84s -> 2951.08s]  To when you throw the egg.
[2951.08s -> 2951.80s]  Yeah, okay.
[2951.80s -> 2952.76s]  I know.
[2954.28s -> 2959.60s]  Because blocking the door.
[2968.32s -> 2969.04s]  What are you doing?
[2970.08s -> 2972.40s]  Somebody's blocking our office door from the inside.
[2972.40s -> 2973.60s]  No, I just gave them the egg.
[2974.32s -> 2975.36s]  Don't they leave?
[2975.36s -> 2976.88s]  I don't want to bother ourselves.
[2983.55s -> 2984.03s]  AI?
[2985.18s -> 2985.50s]  TAR?
[2986.30s -> 2991.45s]  Can I give this to them?
[2997.42s -> 2998.70s]  That doesn't need a new AI.
[3003.61s -> 3004.25s]  Whoa, wait.
[3005.72s -> 3007.24s]  I know what needs a new brain.
[3016.83s -> 3018.59s]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[3019.47s -> 3021.07s]  It's all neat and computery.
[3021.07s -> 3023.63s]  It's got to help out with your laser light show.
[3023.63s -> 3025.39s]  Thanks, Sam and Max.
[3025.39s -> 3026.59s]  This will be playful.
[3027.23s -> 3028.03s]  He's reading chat.
[3028.91s -> 3030.35s]  You can never prove that.
[3032.03s -> 3033.31s]  That ain't right.
[3033.31s -> 3034.75s]  What did you guys do?
[3034.75s -> 3037.23s]  Reconfiguring neural network donors.
[3037.95s -> 3040.11s]  So you're back from outer space.
[3040.11s -> 3040.91s]  Evacuate!
[3041.47s -> 3042.91s]  Evacuate!
[3042.91s -> 3044.19s]  Did you think I'd struggle?
[3047.45s -> 3048.81s]  Did I lay down and die?
[3050.49s -> 3051.29s]  I'll reach you out.
[3051.29s -> 3052.57s]  You will not die.
[3052.57s -> 3053.93s]  I will survive.
[3053.93s -> 3055.13s]  I will survive.
[3055.13s -> 3057.05s]  I need Timmy.
[3057.05s -> 3058.49s]  Did you just kill that rat?
[3058.49s -> 3059.93s]  So cold.
[3059.93s -> 3062.08s]  So f***ing cold.
[3062.08s -> 3064.30s]  Medic!
[3064.30s -> 3067.82s]  For emergency medical service, press or say one now.
[3068.70s -> 3071.98s]  Just save my boy, Hanger and Timmy!
[3072.78s -> 3074.54s]  Live, damn it, live!
[3074.54s -> 3076.06s]  How many other people were inside?
[3076.06s -> 3078.86s]  Well, if that doesn't help us get into hell, nothing will.
[3078.86s -> 3080.14s]  That just got turned upside down.
[3080.78s -> 3083.98s]  There's like 30 dead rats in here.
[3083.98s -> 3087.90s]  He stood up and they were all playing cards and stuff and it just tipped upside down.
[3087.90s -> 3090.30s]  Somebody's head got crushed with a desk right here.
[3090.94s -> 3091.58s]  Think about that.
[3093.12s -> 3095.12s]  There's like four or five people at that blackjack table.
[3095.12s -> 3097.60s]  When he stood up, it flipped over and crushed him.
[3098.24s -> 3098.96s]  What the f***?
[3099.76s -> 3102.92s]  Hey, robot.
[3102.92s -> 3104.04s]  Greetings, morons.
[3106.16s -> 3107.36s]  Dude, that's crazy.
[3107.36s -> 3123.79s]  You guys are going to put me in like the f***ing hospital.
[3124.80s -> 3126.08s]  Okay, what's with the attitude?
[3126.08s -> 3127.60s]  What's with the attitude?
[3127.60s -> 3132.00s]  The artificial intelligence unit you installed is refreshingly blunt, jackass.
[3132.00s -> 3135.04s]  My time subroutines have been disabled.
[3135.04s -> 3137.12s]  I don't care what I say anymore.
[3137.12s -> 3138.40s]  This is my life.
[3141.08s -> 3141.58s]  What?
[3143.24s -> 3144.36s]  That was like perfect.
[3148.43s -> 3149.79s]  Does he still not know?
[3150.59s -> 3168.38s]  Let me hold on a minute.
[3168.38s -> 3168.94s]  Is it this?
[3179.07s -> 3182.43s]  Now that you're mostly rat-free, what's next for you, Mr. Maimtron?
[3182.43s -> 3184.19s]  I am planning to relocate.
[3184.19s -> 3185.79s]  Not that it is any of your business.
[3186.35s -> 3189.15s]  Are you going to make a move to a town that's right for you?
[3189.15s -> 3189.95s]  Affirmative.
[3189.95s -> 3193.63s]  A town to keep me moving, to keep me proven with some energy.
[3195.31s -> 3195.95s]  All right, we need your help.
[3195.95s -> 3196.99s]  Do us a favor.
[3196.99s -> 3198.19s]  I can't go for that.
[3198.75s -> 3199.47s]  No can do.
[3200.11s -> 3203.71s]  With my new AI, I can only be controlled remotely.
[3203.71s -> 3204.35s]  I can do that.
[3205.63s -> 3206.99s]  We'll talk to you later.
[3206.99s -> 3208.03s]  You can call me.
[3208.03s -> 3209.15s]  Call me any time.
[3213.42s -> 3215.76s]  Ooh, let me, let me.
[3215.76s -> 3219.36s]  There'll be snow flurries in hell before I let you have control of a two-story tall
[3219.36s -> 3220.48s]  battle robot, Max.
[3220.48s -> 3223.52s]  Here I go again on my own.
[3223.52s -> 3226.00s]  Here I go again on my own.
[3227.20s -> 3232.41s]  Down the only open road I ever known.
[3232.41s -> 3233.13s]  Right.
[3233.13s -> 3235.53s]  Like a drifter, I was born no one.
[3235.53s -> 3236.25s]  I know how to do it.
[3237.98s -> 3239.18s]  All right, so I'm going to start breaking stuff.
[3239.18s -> 3240.30s]  Earth is on fire.
[3241.02s -> 3243.71s]  Smash.
[3243.71s -> 3244.75s]  What are we smashing?
[3244.75s -> 3245.39s]  Foscos?
[3245.39s -> 3246.75s]  No, you're never going to get it.
[3249.63s -> 3251.07s]  Mama said knock you out.
[3252.16s -> 3253.04s]  I'm going to knock you out.
[3253.60s -> 3257.76s]  And we'll have fun, fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-Bird away.
[3268.88s -> 3270.16s]  Stop getting me riled up.
[3271.20s -> 3273.60s]  I saw like two people tell me to, I'm not doing that anymore.
[3274.40s -> 3276.64s]  It's a nice day for a white wedding.
[3277.44s -> 3280.43s]  Watch out, boys.
[3280.43s -> 3281.55s]  She'll chew you up.
[3281.55s -> 3283.15s]  She's a man, either.
[3283.15s -> 3286.67s]  Thanks for the $50 just came in from TalksRay.
[3287.55s -> 3288.11s]  50 bucks.
[3288.11s -> 3289.95s]  There's no message, just 5,000 bits.
[3289.95s -> 3290.99s]  That's a lot of fucking money.
[3290.99s -> 3291.47s]  Thank you.
[3291.47s -> 3292.67s]  Talk about mudflaps.
[3292.67s -> 3293.79s]  My gal's gone.
[3295.37s -> 3296.17s]  It's a lot of money.
[3297.13s -> 3298.17s]  Thank you for that.
[3298.17s -> 3299.45s]  What am I supposed to break here?
[3300.25s -> 3301.29s]  In the manhole?
[3301.29s -> 3305.77s]  That leads to a land down under where women grow and men plunder.
[3307.21s -> 3308.65s]  Vegemite Sandwich.
[3308.65s -> 3309.37s]  I know these songs.
[3309.37s -> 3310.65s]  We didn't start the fire.
[3310.65s -> 3313.37s]  It was always burning since the world's been turning.
[3315.20s -> 3316.00s]  I'm going to sing you a song.
[3316.00s -> 3318.00s]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[3318.00s -> 3320.64s]  And I feel fine.
[3320.64s -> 3322.64s]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[3322.64s -> 3323.36s]  I don't know that one.
[3324.40s -> 3325.69s]  What's that one?
[3325.69s -> 3327.77s]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[3327.77s -> 3330.49s]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[3333.05s -> 3333.53s]  No.
[3333.53s -> 3334.73s]  Earth is on fire.
[3336.73s -> 3337.29s]  I can't.
[3337.29s -> 3337.77s]  I'm sorry.
[3337.77s -> 3339.13s]  I had to stop that one halfway.
[3340.56s -> 3341.68s]  It's not a rock.
[3341.68s -> 3342.88s]  It's a rock monster.
[3344.67s -> 3346.59s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[3346.59s -> 3347.87s]  What am I supposed to be seeing?
[3348.75s -> 3351.23s]  Hello?
[3351.23s -> 3353.15s]  Is there anybody in there?
[3353.15s -> 3354.75s]  They're just too shy shy.
[3355.39s -> 3363.04s]  What was I supposed to do?
[3363.84s -> 3367.50s]  Get me back in here.
[3368.06s -> 3370.14s]  Did I click on everything I possibly could click?
[3370.14s -> 3370.30s]  No.
[3370.30s -> 3380.38s]  Maybe they could've cracked.
[3380.38s -> 3382.06s]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[3385.08s -> 3385.96s]  Never heard of the Beatles.
[3385.96s -> 3386.60s]  Night train.
[3388.20s -> 3390.12s]  Tomo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.
[3397.61s -> 3400.78s]  All right, got the token.
[3404.51s -> 3404.75s]  Look.
[3404.75s -> 3407.63s]  I don't think she'd appreciate a ride on the Soul Train as much as we would.
[3408.35s -> 3409.61s]  So now we can go down here.
[3410.49s -> 3413.18s]  Game's fucking easy.
[3413.18s -> 3414.22s]  Game's fucking easy.
[3414.22s -> 3415.18s]  Game's fucking easy.
[3415.18s -> 3416.14s]  Game's fucking easy.
[3422.00s -> 3423.28s]  Sam and Max.
[3423.28s -> 3425.18s]  Could you guys hurry it up?
[3425.18s -> 3427.82s]  I've heard about a robot full of seriously injured rats
[3427.82s -> 3429.74s]  and I've got a quota to fill.
[3429.74s -> 3431.26s]  Hold your pale horses.
[3431.26s -> 3432.14s]  We're working on it.
[3433.02s -> 3433.90s]  Easy when you reach out.
[3433.90s -> 3435.34s]  Yeah, but look.
[3435.34s -> 3435.82s]  Here's the thing.
[3436.94s -> 3438.46s]  Yeah, we've been doing this for like an hour,
[3438.46s -> 3441.02s]  but we've just been having fun just talking and fucking around.
[3441.02s -> 3441.74s]  It doesn't matter.
[3441.74s -> 3442.78s]  Like the game is fun.
[3442.78s -> 3443.66s]  It's cool.
[3443.66s -> 3445.34s]  We get to see references and fun stuff,
[3445.34s -> 3446.70s]  but like we're just taking our time.
[3446.70s -> 3449.90s]  Like right now, 35 seconds have gone by
[3449.90s -> 3451.42s]  and I didn't click this guy yet.
[3451.98s -> 3453.98s]  You know, like it's all right.
[3453.98s -> 3454.62s]  That just happened.
[3454.62s -> 3455.18s]  That's what happened.
[3458.43s -> 3460.75s]  One adult and one Max, please.
[3460.75s -> 3463.23s]  How did you guys get a token?
[3463.23s -> 3465.23s]  We've done things, Harry.
[3465.23s -> 3466.67s]  Things we're not proud of.
[3467.55s -> 3468.99s]  Wicked things.
[3468.99s -> 3469.79s]  Shut up, Max.
[3470.83s -> 3473.15s]  Zombie Abraham Lincoln didn't want his.
[3473.15s -> 3474.27s]  Oh, good.
[3475.07s -> 3477.31s]  Put your token in the machine to call the train.
[3480.11s -> 3480.59s]  Crazy.
[3482.19s -> 3483.55s]  Hey, that's how it goes.
[3485.39s -> 3490.04s]  Everybody get on board.
[3490.04s -> 3492.60s]  Oh, I thought they were going to do the Ozzy Osbourne train.
[3502.59s -> 3504.83s]  That was the intro.
[3506.19s -> 3506.99s]  Oh, God.
[3508.51s -> 3508.91s]  Hold on.
[3517.18s -> 3518.62s]  I wasn't cut out for this today.
[3519.44s -> 3520.64s]  I should have taken another day.
[3526.33s -> 3527.29s]  Get out of here.
[3528.33s -> 3529.21s]  Leave me alone.
[3529.21s -> 3530.33s]  I'm not even logged in.
[3546.72s -> 3547.76s]  This is hell.
[3547.76s -> 3548.80s]  Thank you for holding.
[3549.84s -> 3550.88s]  No, hell.
[3552.56s -> 3554.24s]  What number were you trying to reach?
[3555.04s -> 3557.44s]  No, they are 666.
[3558.08s -> 3559.60s]  Yeah, no problem.
[3561.20s -> 3562.24s]  See you soon.
[3563.36s -> 3565.04s]  Can I help you?
[3565.04s -> 3566.80s]  We want to talk to the guy in charge.
[3567.36s -> 3569.52s]  He's taken Bosco's soul too early.
[3569.52s -> 3570.08s]  I see.
[3570.80s -> 3574.64s]  His schedule is full at the moment, but I'll see what I can do.
[3575.44s -> 3576.72s]  And you are?
[3578.80s -> 3579.52s]  Sam and Max.
[3583.20s -> 3584.40s]  The ones who killed me.
[3584.40s -> 3585.52s]  Oh, yes.
[3585.52s -> 3587.76s]  The ones who sent me here.
[3587.76s -> 3590.00s]  Oh, I'll get right on that.
[3590.80s -> 3593.52s]  Jürgen, be a peach and clear out my calendar for...
[3595.96s -> 3597.56s]  Who authorized this?
[3597.56s -> 3599.48s]  A giant horned skull?
[3600.20s -> 3601.16s]  Really?
[3601.16s -> 3601.88s]  I'm sorry.
[3601.88s -> 3603.32s]  I thought this was 2008.
[3603.32s -> 3604.36s]  Teeth are disgusting.
[3604.36s -> 3604.92s]  Oh, very well.
[3605.48s -> 3607.24s]  Cancel all my appointments, would you?
[3607.80s -> 3609.80s]  I'll be in my office.
[3610.84s -> 3613.80s]  Oh, did I forget to introduce you.
[3614.52s -> 3616.20s]  How careless of me.
[3616.20s -> 3618.28s]  You can have a seat and wait if you like.
[3619.64s -> 3624.76s]  He doesn't like the skull.
[3625.56s -> 3627.48s]  Somebody really needs an antacid.
[3628.36s -> 3637.90s]  Stomach acid.
[3639.24s -> 3642.60s]  I wonder if that thing folds out into a bed of spikes.
[3643.40s -> 3653.53s]  What are you talking about?
[3653.53s -> 3655.13s]  I really shouldn't be watching my weight.
[3655.13s -> 3657.05s]  Don't worry.
[3657.05s -> 3658.41s]  They're all nearsighted.
[3659.05s -> 3660.01s]  I've lost it.
[3660.01s -> 3664.49s]  I said the word stomach acid once and then my internet like fucked up for a second.
[3665.85s -> 3666.65s]  Did I drop frames?
[3669.84s -> 3670.80s]  This is hell.
[3670.80s -> 3671.52s]  Hold please.
[3672.16s -> 3672.66s]  Yes.
[3673.84s -> 3675.47s]  That's like annoying if I am.
[3676.11s -> 3676.59s]  Shouldn't be.
[3677.23s -> 3678.30s]  Can we get a tour?
[3678.30s -> 3679.66s]  Can we get a tour of the place?
[3679.74s -> 3681.74s]  You'll have to guide yourselves.
[3681.74s -> 3683.82s]  I have to answer the phones.
[3683.82s -> 3685.18s]  For eternity.
[3685.74s -> 3688.06s]  Don't we need a visitor's badge or something?
[3688.06s -> 3688.62s]  No.
[3688.62s -> 3691.42s]  As frequent contributors, you can go where you like.
[3692.06s -> 3693.82s]  Just look, though.
[3693.82s -> 3695.66s]  Don't touch anything.
[3695.66s -> 3696.16s]  Okay.
[3697.08s -> 3699.00s]  We want to visit Bosco.
[3699.00s -> 3700.28s]  Where's he hanging out?
[3700.28s -> 3700.52s]  No.
[3700.52s -> 3704.28s]  If he is a friend of yours, he has a personalized hell in the back.
[3705.32s -> 3708.73s]  At least he has a sick gamer headset.
[3709.69s -> 3713.15s]  Uh, that's like an original Xbox headset.
[3713.87s -> 3718.09s]  This isn't at all what I expected from hell.
[3718.09s -> 3720.89s]  It's, uh, soulless.
[3720.89s -> 3723.61s]  Yeah, which is kind of missing the whole point of hell.
[3723.61s -> 3727.69s]  But the corporate presence has done wonders for our productivity.
[3727.69s -> 3730.97s]  My soul taking operation, which you destroyed.
[3731.93s -> 3736.09s]  The soul crushing on delivery system, which you destroyed.
[3736.89s -> 3739.45s]  Hell is now running at peak efficiency.
[3739.45s -> 3740.81s]  Or at least it was.
[3742.41s -> 3751.47s]  Well, we want to talk to Satan.
[3751.47s -> 3753.07s]  We want to talk to Satan.
[3753.07s -> 3753.87s]  Yes.
[3753.87s -> 3755.79s]  Well, I fear you just missed him.
[3756.43s -> 3758.03s]  Much like you just missed saving me.
[3758.03s -> 3758.99s]  Back right to the hell.
[3758.99s -> 3760.35s]  You even had your chance.
[3760.35s -> 3761.15s]  Well, yeah.
[3761.15s -> 3763.39s]  But you know, you are kind of evil.
[3763.39s -> 3764.51s]  And you killed us.
[3765.23s -> 3766.19s]  No matter.
[3766.19s -> 3769.31s]  I will mention you are waiting next time the boss visits.
[3769.31s -> 3771.79s]  He drops by every 66 years or so.
[3774.19s -> 3776.84s]  Where's all the cool hell stuff?
[3776.84s -> 3777.24s]  Yeah.
[3777.24s -> 3778.04s]  Like the carnivorous.
[3778.04s -> 3778.92s]  Cool hell stuff.
[3779.08s -> 3781.80s]  Acid baths and karaoke bars.
[3781.80s -> 3782.68s]  Please.
[3782.68s -> 3785.32s]  This is so divinely comical.
[3785.32s -> 3787.96s]  This is the 21st century dog.
[3787.96s -> 3788.84s]  Cool hell stuff.
[3788.84s -> 3789.16s]  All right.
[3789.72s -> 3790.04s]  Second.
[3790.04s -> 3790.84s]  Hold all our calls.
[3791.88s -> 3792.84s]  Yes.
[3792.84s -> 3795.88s]  This is so funny to the point that I cannot remember to laugh.
[3797.08s -> 3799.29s]  Can we actually get to it?
[3799.29s -> 3799.45s]  All right.
[3799.45s -> 3799.77s]  Hold on.
[3799.77s -> 3800.89s]  Give me, give me a second here.
[3801.61s -> 3802.33s]  Let me save it.
[3803.37s -> 3804.81s]  I haven't done a manual save in a while.
[3813.26s -> 3814.78s]  No, this is, this is autosave, does it?
[3819.08s -> 3819.32s]  Right.
[3821.12s -> 3821.68s]  No, it's fine.
[3824.36s -> 3825.40s]  Fucking stress.
[3825.40s -> 3826.92s]  I thought we were much further in.
[3826.92s -> 3827.08s]  Okay.
[3827.08s -> 3827.40s]  Whatever.
[3827.40s -> 3827.72s]  We're fine.
[3831.15s -> 3831.71s]  One adult.
[3835.08s -> 3838.68s]  I, I specifically remember the doctor said don't, no screaming.
[3843.85s -> 3844.25s]  Skipping.
[3844.25s -> 3845.05s]  We already saw this.
[3845.05s -> 3845.45s]  I know.
[3845.45s -> 3846.25s]  Okay.
[3846.25s -> 3846.57s]  Give me.
[3848.01s -> 3849.21s]  Why is it so close?
[3849.21s -> 3849.61s]  It's like.
[3856.57s -> 3862.40s]  Tom Jeremy, I want to make sure.
[3863.04s -> 3863.61s]  All right.
[3863.61s -> 3864.17s]  I'm fucking.
[3867.36s -> 3869.36s]  I'm turned off all steam.
[3869.36s -> 3870.80s]  I'm disabling steam forever.
[3871.60s -> 3874.30s]  You've already seen this.
[3874.30s -> 3875.90s]  Let it play out in the background.
[3875.90s -> 3890.25s]  I've disabled the whole steam overlay.
[3890.97s -> 3893.37s]  Like it's not, it's impossible for anything to pop up, right?
[3893.37s -> 3894.01s]  Impossible.
[3895.00s -> 3897.56s]  If I, if the whole steam relays off, it's impossible.
[3907.34s -> 3907.58s]  Sure.
[3907.58s -> 3907.90s]  Okay.
[3907.90s -> 3908.30s]  We're good.
[3909.74s -> 3910.78s]  Yeah, but the doctor told me.
[3912.78s -> 3913.58s]  We've already seen it.
[3913.58s -> 3914.30s]  I'm just going to get there.
[3914.30s -> 3915.42s]  Thank God I had the autosave.
[3915.42s -> 3917.66s]  Otherwise, I mean, it's just the intro.
[3917.66s -> 3918.46s]  Don't worry about this.
[3918.46s -> 3925.71s]  You can, this is how.
[3925.71s -> 3925.95s]  Yeah.
[3927.36s -> 3927.60s]  This.
[3927.60s -> 3930.89s]  Okay.
[3930.89s -> 3931.53s]  We got it.
[3931.53s -> 3931.69s]  Yeah.
[3931.69s -> 3931.93s]  Yeah.
[3931.93s -> 3932.01s]  Yeah.
[3932.01s -> 3932.73s]  We've already seen it.
[3932.73s -> 3933.61s]  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, okay.
[3933.61s -> 3933.77s]  Good.
[3933.77s -> 3934.09s]  Good morning.
[3934.09s -> 3935.13s]  Wait, was Bosco found out?
[3936.01s -> 3936.41s]  Okay.
[3936.41s -> 3936.97s]  Now we're going to say.
[3947.16s -> 3947.48s]  Okay.
[3948.51s -> 3949.15s]  Nothing happened.
[3952.40s -> 3954.72s]  Now, Jeremy, I want to make sure you're very, very clear about this.
[3955.98s -> 3958.30s]  The doctor did not sound anything like this.
[3958.30s -> 3961.26s]  But for some reason, every single doctor needs to be like this crazy,
[3961.26s -> 3965.34s]  intelligent, sage, wizard type person in every piece of media.
[3965.34s -> 3965.74s]  Geez.
[3966.62s -> 3967.18s]  Must be from.
[3967.18s -> 3975.58s]  I'm not supposed to frame George Washington.
[3975.58s -> 3976.14s]  Yeah.
[3976.14s -> 3982.56s]  Guy, you find me a fictional doctor and a fictional George Washington.
[3982.56s -> 3986.83s]  And I guarantee you that they both have the same voice.
[3986.83s -> 3990.33s]  Fictional doctor, fictional George Washington.
[3990.33s -> 3992.73s]  And no, like George Clooney in ER doesn't count.
[3992.73s -> 3995.69s]  I'm talking like, like a cartoon doctor.
[3995.69s -> 4010.41s]  The corporate presence.
[4010.41s -> 4011.05s]  Hugh Bliss.
[4011.05s -> 4012.33s]  This is, people doesn't work here.
[4014.04s -> 4015.96s]  Hey, shambling corporate presence.
[4015.96s -> 4016.76s]  Dr. Mario.
[4016.76s -> 4018.28s]  That's not, that's no, sorry.
[4018.28s -> 4019.00s]  What you working on?
[4020.51s -> 4022.67s]  Dr. Mario is a costume that Mario wears.
[4026.57s -> 4030.73s]  If I put a doctor's like costume on, would I then be a doctor?
[4031.37s -> 4033.29s]  No, it's a costume that Mario wears.
[4033.29s -> 4036.24s]  Mario's a plumber.
[4036.24s -> 4037.04s]  He's not a doctor.
[4037.04s -> 4038.08s]  Mario's not a doctor.
[4038.08s -> 4043.55s]  He is a plumber and he wore a doctor costume one time in like 1989
[4043.55s -> 4045.39s]  and had like a Tetris game.
[4045.39s -> 4046.49s]  He's not a doctor.
[4049.84s -> 4051.76s]  Oh, that's funny.
[4056.73s -> 4057.53s]  Coffee cup from you.
[4057.53s -> 4060.57s]  You don't have to be damned to work here, but it helps.
[4061.37s -> 4062.49s]  It looks cold.
[4062.49s -> 4063.21s]  I can't even.
[4068.73s -> 4069.53s]  Hey, SCP.
[4070.81s -> 4071.53s]  SCP.
[4073.76s -> 4075.20s]  Oh, I see.
[4076.30s -> 4077.02s]  SCP.
[4077.66s -> 4079.61s]  Is that intentional?
[4080.25s -> 4082.81s]  Had to bring with 10 years ago, 12 years ago.
[4082.81s -> 4083.37s]  That has to be.
[4086.32s -> 4086.80s]  Hey, buddy.
[4088.59s -> 4091.07s]  Look, it's Hugh Bliss.
[4092.28s -> 4093.00s]  What the fuck?
[4093.00s -> 4095.56s]  Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[4095.56s -> 4098.72s]  I don't say hi.
[4100.89s -> 4101.93s]  Nice trick with your head.
[4101.93s -> 4102.97s]  Nice trick with your head.
[4102.97s -> 4105.77s]  Do exorcisms work on people already in hell?
[4110.81s -> 4111.45s]  Messed up.
[4111.45s -> 4112.33s]  All right, well, we missed you.
[4112.33s -> 4112.89s]  You busy?
[4112.89s -> 4113.69s]  We're going for lunch.
[4113.69s -> 4114.33s]  Want to come?
[4114.33s -> 4116.01s]  Did you get that meeting request I sent?
[4116.01s -> 4116.97s]  What are your dreams?
[4121.10s -> 4122.38s]  Have mercy on us.
[4122.38s -> 4123.82s]  Sorry about killing you last year.
[4125.44s -> 4126.08s]  It happens.
[4127.60s -> 4128.72s]  What do you do here?
[4128.72s -> 4132.64s]  I work for the largest division at hell, the FCC.
[4133.28s -> 4133.92s]  Doing what?
[4134.48s -> 4135.68s]  I bleep.
[4135.68s -> 4137.44s]  Right here in your cubicle?
[4137.44s -> 4139.36s]  In front of Satan and everyone?
[4141.37s -> 4142.25s]  You bleep?
[4142.25s -> 4145.61s]  I listen for naughty words, and I bleep them.
[4145.61s -> 4149.93s]  No swearing, no cursing, and no oaths of any kind.
[4149.93s -> 4152.25s]  That takes the fun out of everything.
[4152.25s -> 4153.05s]  Exactly.
[4154.49s -> 4155.53s]  Now, can we say?
[4155.53s -> 4156.49s]  Can we say?
[4156.49s -> 4156.99s]  No.
[4158.09s -> 4158.65s]  What about?
[4161.28s -> 4161.84s]  What about?
[4162.80s -> 4163.95s]  Tugger?
[4163.95s -> 4164.91s]  Yanker?
[4164.91s -> 4165.87s]  Tool handler?
[4166.91s -> 4168.27s]  Okay, good to know.
[4169.71s -> 4170.43s]  You're a lousy bleeper.
[4170.43s -> 4172.27s]  What about that time Jimmy Hoffa said,
[4172.27s -> 4174.43s]  ride the fucking surfboard?
[4174.43s -> 4176.91s]  Oh yeah, you should have bleeped the shit out of that.
[4176.91s -> 4179.15s]  Fucking is not on the list.
[4179.15s -> 4179.55s]  Sorry.
[4180.19s -> 4181.39s]  Tool handler is safe.
[4182.19s -> 4183.37s]  Later, Hugh Bliss.
[4185.96s -> 4192.32s]  Okay, well, let's see, we got Brady Culture.
[4192.32s -> 4193.12s]  Brady Culture?
[4193.12s -> 4194.48s]  Got some good callbacks here.
[4194.48s -> 4196.16s]  I didn't even know he was sick.
[4196.16s -> 4198.56s]  How do I not get an obituary?
[4198.56s -> 4200.88s]  I'm a major television star,
[4200.88s -> 4203.84s]  an international buzz generator.
[4203.84s -> 4206.00s]  A cosmic pain in my backside.
[4209.05s -> 4209.85s]  How did you get here?
[4209.85s -> 4211.53s]  What are you doing in hell?
[4211.53s -> 4213.05s]  Living large.
[4213.05s -> 4216.33s]  I'd been a temp in purgatory for the last year and a half,
[4216.33s -> 4219.61s]  but finally, I'm a full-time employee.
[4220.25s -> 4222.25s]  Right, we don't actually care.
[4222.25s -> 4224.17s]  We're famous TV stars.
[4224.81s -> 4226.25s]  Sticks and stones.
[4226.25s -> 4227.69s]  I don't care what anyone says.
[4227.69s -> 4229.21s]  It's the announcer from You Don't Know Jack.
[4229.21s -> 4229.85s]  And I'm happy.
[4231.13s -> 4233.13s]  How would you know?
[4233.13s -> 4234.97s]  That's a very specific thing to know.
[4235.77s -> 4237.29s]  Wow, I think it is.
[4238.46s -> 4240.54s]  How'd your fro grow back so fast?
[4240.54s -> 4241.34s]  Elf tears.
[4242.22s -> 4245.69s]  Does your on-the-job training include evil laughsmanship?
[4249.37s -> 4250.94s]  I guess that's a no.
[4250.94s -> 4253.50s]  No, I can't do like an employee match on that laugh, guys.
[4253.50s -> 4254.38s]  I'm sorry.
[4254.38s -> 4256.54s]  I know I usually do that, but I can't.
[4257.42s -> 4257.74s]  Laugh.
[4260.86s -> 4263.52s]  I could do way better than that.
[4263.52s -> 4264.16s]  You know I can.
[4264.88s -> 4266.32s]  Somebody click clip when I did it before.
[4267.21s -> 4268.17s]  I can't do that right now.
[4268.17s -> 4268.89s]  I'm going to slow down.
[4269.61s -> 4270.17s]  Forgive me.
[4270.17s -> 4273.93s]  My mouth is too parched for a spit tape, but you like hell?
[4275.69s -> 4280.09s]  I mean, sure, the wailing of millions of tortured souls gets a little old.
[4280.09s -> 4284.89s]  And my headphones are 10 sizes too small, but none of that matters.
[4284.89s -> 4287.61s]  Because I finally found someone who believes in me.
[4288.25s -> 4289.21s]  Satan.
[4289.21s -> 4292.89s]  He is the only true equal opportunity employer.
[4292.89s -> 4294.49s]  Do it now and rip your ass.
[4295.93s -> 4297.93s]  No, I'm not going to.
[4297.93s -> 4298.25s]  I can't.
[4298.25s -> 4298.65s]  Later, Brady.
[4300.17s -> 4301.85s]  I screamed loud.
[4302.73s -> 4304.73s]  And like I can't do that.
[4304.73s -> 4305.77s]  I can't be screaming.
[4307.02s -> 4311.18s]  Like I'm telling you, type into Google, can you scream after a colonoscopy?
[4311.18s -> 4313.02s]  And some of the major results are no.
[4315.20s -> 4316.00s]  Soft talking?
[4323.60s -> 4328.76s]  Okay, who forgot to fill the pot?
[4328.76s -> 4332.52s]  Reminder, your mama don't work here.
[4332.52s -> 4333.88s]  Hey, we needed her token.
[4334.52s -> 4338.70s]  The only place here that's room temperature.
[4344.72s -> 4347.60s]  Things have gotten so bad they had to cut minimum wage in half.
[4348.60s -> 4349.88s]  You're going to tear your stitches.
[4349.88s -> 4351.08s]  I don't think I have stitches.
[4358.41s -> 4359.21s]  What the hell?
[4361.16s -> 4362.68s]  What the fuck is this?
[4363.95s -> 4365.39s]  Sexual harassment and you.
[4366.56s -> 4369.76s]  Oh, I've touched all those places several times.
[4370.48s -> 4370.80s]  What?
[4372.43s -> 4373.07s]  Wait, wait.
[4373.88s -> 4375.72s]  What did Sam just say?
[4376.52s -> 4377.96s]  What did Sam just say?
[4382.22s -> 4383.02s]  Of what?
[4387.68s -> 4388.80s]  Holy shit, Sam.
[4389.52s -> 4391.28s]  Ah, they went for the swivel throne.
[4391.28s -> 4392.00s]  Good choice.
[4394.65s -> 4398.57s]  Nothing inspires investors like a few dead smugglers frozen in carbonite.
[4398.57s -> 4399.29s]  Ask anyone.
[4400.25s -> 4403.36s]  I like that chair.
[4404.08s -> 4407.61s]  I want a chair like this.
[4413.95s -> 4414.59s]  Okay.
[4414.59s -> 4415.39s]  What's this poster?
[4418.08s -> 4420.16s]  I guess the kitten was off on another photo shoot.
[4422.67s -> 4424.56s]  What about this pam?
[4424.56s -> 4425.12s]  A key card.
[4425.76s -> 4428.78s]  Can I take that or do I have to distract them or something?
[4428.78s -> 4430.22s]  Can we have your key card?
[4430.22s -> 4432.86s]  Well, considering you already took it, I guess so.
[4433.50s -> 4435.34s]  I don't need it anymore.
[4435.34s -> 4437.66s]  Now that I'm full time in hell, suckers.
[4438.22s -> 4439.18s]  Yeah, Brady.
[4439.18s -> 4440.14s]  You win.
[4441.42s -> 4441.66s]  All right.
[4441.66s -> 4442.54s]  Well, we can just have it.
[4443.87s -> 4447.36s]  Greed, lust, greed.
[4452.27s -> 4453.07s]  Oh, big door.
[4454.19s -> 4455.23s]  Sam and Max relief.
[4455.23s -> 4457.15s]  Why do we have like our own personal stuff here?
[4457.95s -> 4459.37s]  Have we been here before?
[4459.37s -> 4460.33s]  Dry erase blood.
[4462.81s -> 4463.93s]  Sam and Max relief.
[4468.11s -> 4470.59s]  Ah, what kind of hellish bas relief is this?
[4471.71s -> 4472.75s]  I don't know.
[4472.75s -> 4476.75s]  And yet a mysterious voice compels me to enter.
[4477.63s -> 4478.56s]  Let's go in.
[4492.24s -> 4495.44s]  I'm impressed by the decor, but what kind of place is this?
[4499.74s -> 4500.62s]  Are we Satan?
[4500.62s -> 4503.42s]  They've got little play sets of all our pals.
[4503.42s -> 4504.46s]  Hey, Bosco.
[4505.68s -> 4506.16s]  Hang on.
[4506.16s -> 4507.44s]  I know what this is.
[4507.44s -> 4510.96s]  This is where they keep all the souls of people who died during our cases.
[4510.96s -> 4515.04s]  They opened it already, but I had a speech prepared and everything.
[4515.20s -> 4516.56s]  You guys have killed a lot of people.
[4517.44s -> 4518.16s]  Oh, my goodness.
[4519.48s -> 4520.04s]  Uh, okay.
[4521.60s -> 4523.12s]  Max the Destroyer.
[4523.12s -> 4524.24s]  Sam the Devourer.
[4526.14s -> 4527.42s]  Sam the Devourer.
[4528.06s -> 4529.18s]  Very flattering like this.
[4533.44s -> 4534.72s]  Max the Destroyer.
[4535.60s -> 4537.20s]  They got my bad side.
[4537.20s -> 4538.32s]  I want a do-over.
[4543.71s -> 4547.15s]  Looks like everybody's permanent record's on file, but they're all locked.
[4549.96s -> 4550.28s]  Plaque.
[4551.44s -> 4556.56s]  Dedicated to Sam and Max for a lifetime of generous donations of souls,
[4556.56s -> 4558.64s]  both evil and simply led astray.
[4559.68s -> 4566.72s]  Dedicated to Sam and Max for a lifetime of generous donations of souls,
[4566.72s -> 4568.32s]  both evil and simply led astray.
[4569.12s -> 4571.20s]  Somebody said Hornstein and Smog.
[4572.08s -> 4577.71s]  Bosco, we see you in there.
[4578.83s -> 4581.23s]  Dear God, they're watching me.
[4581.79s -> 4582.67s]  Help me!
[4585.69s -> 4586.41s]  This is fucked up.
[4591.05s -> 4592.01s]  Help me!
[4592.01s -> 4594.49s]  Help me!
[4594.49s -> 4595.85s]  You're like stuck in a nightmare.
[4597.21s -> 4599.69s]  It's everyone we know who's died in the last year.
[4599.69s -> 4600.73s]  I must have lost count.
[4602.11s -> 4604.11s]  Oh, no, it's Santa.
[4604.11s -> 4605.87s]  Oh, yeah, Santa's dead.
[4605.87s -> 4609.31s]  I'll never get any work done with that infernal cry.
[4611.24s -> 4612.60s]  Street diorama?
[4612.60s -> 4614.20s]  That looks like our car.
[4614.20s -> 4616.04s]  What did it do to deserve help?
[4616.04s -> 4617.32s]  Oh, the car is dead.
[4617.32s -> 4622.68s]  Wait, can we get like, can we get in here and take the heart of the car?
[4624.83s -> 4626.51s]  It's one of Santa's elves.
[4626.51s -> 4630.35s]  Oh, dear, I'll never make my ship date with all these distractions.
[4632.04s -> 4633.40s]  Is that grandpa stinky?
[4634.44s -> 4635.56s]  More looky-loos.
[4635.56s -> 4638.52s]  Have we really killed this many people in this last season or two?
[4640.78s -> 4642.30s]  Well, let's read the key card.
[4644.28s -> 4644.92s]  Let's see what it says.
[4644.92s -> 4646.76s]  The key card unlocked the dioramas.
[4646.76s -> 4647.26s]  Where to?
[4650.70s -> 4651.66s]  The street?
[4658.64s -> 4660.88s]  This is as fast as it goes, little buddy.
[4660.88s -> 4664.73s]  We are in hell!
[4664.73s -> 4678.44s]  Exit diorama, horn, boomer, driver.
[4678.44s -> 4679.16s]  Go for jump?
[4680.04s -> 4682.00s]  Maybe I need an item to do something here.
[4688.27s -> 4688.99s]  Heat.
[4688.99s -> 4691.34s]  No, I don't think I can do anything here.
[4692.14s -> 4693.95s]  Let's try the other ones.
[4696.89s -> 4698.09s]  We expand it again.
[4698.73s -> 4701.29s]  I thought I'd finally figured out how to keep the weight off.
[4702.91s -> 4704.91s]  Can we use it again?
[4704.91s -> 4706.43s]  Let's go to the Bosco one, right?
[4712.03s -> 4713.39s]  Street theater diorama.
[4713.39s -> 4714.27s]  There we go.
[4714.27s -> 4720.04s]  Oh, no, I didn't have to do it.
[4720.04s -> 4721.40s]  We're coming to watch me.
[4721.40s -> 4723.56s]  Bosco, you're nude.
[4725.88s -> 4727.48s]  It's okay, baby.
[4727.48s -> 4729.00s]  We're all still watching you.
[4729.96s -> 4731.24s]  For eternity.
[4735.45s -> 4737.21s]  Demon Mariachi.
[4737.21s -> 4738.01s]  Demon Sibyl.
[4739.15s -> 4741.15s]  Why do we have to watch Bosco naked?
[4741.71s -> 4749.05s]  Nitrous oxide?
[4749.05s -> 4749.85s]  Dentist chair?
[4752.84s -> 4753.56s]  What the fuck?
[4756.17s -> 4757.21s]  Howdy, Demon Sibyl.
[4758.73s -> 4759.61s]  What you doing?
[4759.61s -> 4763.61s]  I'm analyzing Bosco and it's causing him excruciating.
[4763.61s -> 4765.21s]  Never-ending agony.
[4765.85s -> 4766.73s]  Wow.
[4766.73s -> 4767.45s]  Sorry.
[4767.45s -> 4769.10s]  Didn't mean to break it.
[4769.10s -> 4772.54s]  Well, Bosco, I've almost gotten to the root of your problems,
[4772.54s -> 4774.70s]  but I'll have to keep studying you.
[4775.58s -> 4777.50s]  For ever and ever.
[4777.50s -> 4778.46s]  No, we can pull him out of here.
[4778.46s -> 4779.50s]  Stop looking at me, woman!
[4779.50s -> 4781.50s]  We're just gonna suck like a vacuum down here.
[4781.50s -> 4782.46s]  Like a demon vacuum.
[4782.46s -> 4783.18s]  We'll just suck him up.
[4784.38s -> 4785.87s]  Hi, Demon Mama Bosco.
[4785.87s -> 4786.75s]  This is my hell.
[4786.75s -> 4789.63s]  That's Ms. Demon Mama Bosco to you.
[4789.63s -> 4790.59s]  What are you doing?
[4790.59s -> 4791.15s]  Not really.
[4791.15s -> 4793.39s]  Bosco suffer eternally.
[4793.39s -> 4794.51s]  Isn't it great?
[4794.75s -> 4796.51s]  You know, it's all right.
[4796.51s -> 4799.31s]  I've still got my eyes on you, sugar.
[4799.31s -> 4801.15s]  Sweet Tabasco, make it stop.
[4802.27s -> 4803.85s]  Okay.
[4804.89s -> 4806.99s]  What about Demon Mariachi?
[4806.99s -> 4807.87s]  Demon Mariachi?
[4809.55s -> 4810.83s]  What's your story?
[4810.83s -> 4814.43s]  I got a job watching Bosco for all eternity.
[4814.43s -> 4815.79s]  I don't have that much time.
[4815.79s -> 4817.31s]  Can we just call it a day now?
[4817.31s -> 4818.11s]  Is this game for kids?
[4818.11s -> 4819.95s]  No, I just can't find a way.
[4819.95s -> 4823.07s]  It's like a car accident or a funeral.
[4823.07s -> 4823.71s]  But not as beautiful.
[4823.79s -> 4823.87s]  No.
[4823.87s -> 4827.39s]  Senor, I am watching you all the time.
[4827.39s -> 4827.47s]  No.
[4827.47s -> 4829.95s]  T-H-E-M!
[4831.55s -> 4833.55s]  No, it's not, obviously.
[4834.91s -> 4836.59s]  This is not a game for kids.
[4840.78s -> 4841.82s]  Is this a game for kids?
[4842.38s -> 4844.30s]  Forget about like the naked guy that's over here.
[4845.26s -> 4845.90s]  Nah, I don't know.
[4845.90s -> 4846.54s]  You know, it's tough.
[4846.54s -> 4848.30s]  There's some funny humor and...
[4849.10s -> 4849.71s]  All right.
[4849.71s -> 4850.35s]  Well, let's go look at...
[4850.35s -> 4851.39s]  Let's go talk to Bosco.
[4851.39s -> 4852.35s]  What do I have in my inventory?
[4853.23s -> 4856.00s]  Coffee cup.
[4856.00s -> 4856.72s]  I need coffee.
[4857.28s -> 4862.27s]  There's some funny humor.
[4862.27s -> 4863.63s]  It's nitrous oxide.
[4863.63s -> 4866.11s]  Looks like Bosco has some dental work in his future.
[4866.11s -> 4868.51s]  It'll be twice as hilarious without anesthesia.
[4868.51s -> 4870.11s]  It's a cartoon because it's...
[4870.11s -> 4871.07s]  So it's for kids.
[4871.07s -> 4872.43s]  It looks pretty comfy.
[4872.43s -> 4875.31s]  If you find getting your teeth yanked out of your skull comfy.
[4875.31s -> 4876.91s]  Yes, I understand that...
[4878.67s -> 4886.67s]  Yes, that is like going to GameStop and buying like outlast for your 10-year-old.
[4888.19s -> 4890.91s]  Because it's a video game, so my kids will like it.
[4893.69s -> 4893.85s]  All right.
[4893.85s -> 4895.37s]  What if it looks pretty comfy?
[4895.37s -> 4897.93s]  If you find getting your teeth yanked out of your skull comfy.
[4901.08s -> 4903.96s]  My son said he wanted to have this game called Outlast.
[4907.23s -> 4909.07s]  Do you know about the mature themes in that game?
[4909.07s -> 4910.51s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4910.51s -> 4910.91s]  Shut up.
[4912.25s -> 4913.45s]  Just give me it.
[4913.45s -> 4919.87s]  Okay, so I have nitrous oxide.
[4919.87s -> 4921.79s]  Okay, so somebody upstairs wants this, right?
[4922.59s -> 4924.64s]  Can I do anything about Bosco?
[4924.64s -> 4926.08s]  Hey, hey there, Bosco.
[4926.08s -> 4927.44s]  Don't look at me.
[4927.44s -> 4928.08s]  Trust me.
[4928.08s -> 4930.72s]  We don't want to see you any more than you want to be seen.
[4932.54s -> 4933.66s]  What is actually going on here?
[4933.66s -> 4936.46s]  Why are you standing naked on a stage in front of your mother,
[4936.46s -> 4938.22s]  your therapist, and a Mexican?
[4938.22s -> 4939.98s]  Wait, wait, I know this one.
[4939.98s -> 4943.34s]  I'm in some kind of one-man play, but it never ends.
[4943.34s -> 4945.58s]  And I don't know any of the lines.
[4945.58s -> 4947.34s]  Bosco's personal hell.
[4947.34s -> 4949.26s]  A play in an infinite number of acts.
[4950.38s -> 4952.22s]  I thought waiting for Godot sucked.
[4953.50s -> 4958.44s]  What do you have to do in this play?
[4958.44s -> 4964.04s]  I just got done playing a game of truth or dare with all my ex-girlfriends.
[4964.04s -> 4968.84s]  And after this, I gotta get a root canal while taking an Algebra quiz.
[4968.84s -> 4969.56s]  No, that would suck.
[4970.20s -> 4970.76s]  That's not cool.
[4970.76s -> 4971.88s]  I didn't even study.
[4972.92s -> 4974.64s]  I could do this.
[4975.20s -> 4976.24s]  I could be naked down there.
[4976.24s -> 4977.04s]  That doesn't bother me at all.
[4979.15s -> 4981.07s]  If I was just on stage naked,
[4981.07s -> 4983.95s]  and like there was fucking 5,000 people in the audience,
[4983.95s -> 4985.31s]  I'd just be like, whatever.
[4985.31s -> 4986.51s]  I don't care.
[4986.51s -> 4987.31s]  No, don't care.
[4988.88s -> 4990.08s]  Like, sorry, guys.
[4990.08s -> 4992.24s]  I didn't, this is not supposed to be happening,
[4992.24s -> 4994.16s]  but I'm just here and this is what's happening.
[4994.16s -> 4994.64s]  I don't care.
[4996.22s -> 4998.22s]  You put me in like a dentist chair for eternity.
[4998.22s -> 5001.63s]  I've, I'll take the naked guy over the dentist.
[5004.40s -> 5005.76s]  So how are things?
[5005.76s -> 5010.56s]  Oh, you know, not too bad, except I'm in hell.
[5010.56s -> 5013.68s]  Eternal damnation sure made somebody cranky.
[5014.80s -> 5018.88s]  What if everyone was screaming at this balls, balls, balls,
[5018.88s -> 5019.84s]  everyone's screaming that.
[5020.56s -> 5022.16s]  I mean, at that point, it becomes like a show
[5022.16s -> 5023.36s]  and maybe people will pay for it.
[5024.00s -> 5025.68s]  And I'll start doing like the floss
[5026.64s -> 5028.57s]  to the beat of them saying balls.
[5029.53s -> 5030.97s]  And then people start laughing
[5030.97s -> 5033.77s]  and everyone just starts like having a great time.
[5034.57s -> 5040.12s]  So what, what am I going to do?
[5040.12s -> 5040.60s]  Who cares?
[5042.04s -> 5043.32s]  Oh, I'm trying to buy things.
[5043.32s -> 5045.40s]  Standing butt naked on an empty stage
[5045.40s -> 5047.80s]  miles below the surface of the earth.
[5047.80s -> 5049.56s]  Does it look like I have anything?
[5050.44s -> 5052.17s]  I would get boring after 10 minutes.
[5052.17s -> 5053.85s]  Do you have any chainsaw gasoline?
[5054.49s -> 5055.93s]  I really am in hell.
[5056.73s -> 5061.20s]  Are you sure that would get boring after 10 minutes?
[5061.20s -> 5062.16s]  I don't know about that.
[5063.66s -> 5066.46s]  I feel like I could stand that in the audience
[5066.46s -> 5067.42s]  for like two hours.
[5069.04s -> 5075.82s]  I mean, it would that's balls, balls, balls, balls.
[5076.86s -> 5077.66s]  I could probably sit there
[5077.66s -> 5078.70s]  and then think that was interesting
[5078.70s -> 5079.82s]  for like at least a couple hours.
[5079.82s -> 5082.70s]  And the person's doing the floss faster and faster
[5084.48s -> 5085.68s]  and they don't get to stop.
[5087.40s -> 5089.40s]  You wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for a good seat.
[5090.28s -> 5091.96s]  I would pay like a hundred and fifty dollars
[5091.96s -> 5093.88s]  for like fucking front row seats
[5093.88s -> 5095.64s]  and get like two like Bud Lights
[5095.64s -> 5097.40s]  and just sit there and just have fun.
[5097.96s -> 5098.60s]  If this is hell.
[5099.32s -> 5101.20s]  They probably serve Bud Light in hell.
[5101.20s -> 5102.00s]  I'm assuming they do.
[5105.37s -> 5106.81s]  I forgot what I was going to say.
[5111.13s -> 5112.25s]  Cheer up, Bosco.
[5112.25s -> 5113.53s]  None of this is real.
[5113.53s -> 5115.53s]  It's all an illusion.
[5116.41s -> 5117.77s]  What are you talking about?
[5117.77s -> 5119.37s]  Of course it's real.
[5119.37s -> 5120.73s]  I've been pinching myself.
[5120.73s -> 5122.17s]  Bud Light Lime.
[5122.17s -> 5123.37s]  My face is real.
[5123.37s -> 5124.57s]  My chest is real.
[5124.57s -> 5125.85s]  My stomach is real.
[5125.85s -> 5127.37s]  Okay, we get your point.
[5127.37s -> 5132.00s]  Bud Light Lime is fucking disgusting.
[5134.84s -> 5136.92s]  I remember when I drank Bud Light Lime
[5136.92s -> 5137.72s]  for the first time.
[5139.53s -> 5139.93s]  All right.
[5139.93s -> 5142.17s]  Do you know what Bud Light Lime tastes like?
[5142.17s -> 5142.57s]  Are you ready?
[5142.57s -> 5143.93s]  I'm going to ruin this for you if you like it.
[5143.93s -> 5144.49s]  I'm sorry.
[5144.49s -> 5145.13s]  I'm going to ruin it.
[5147.04s -> 5148.56s]  Do you know what grape,
[5149.36s -> 5150.96s]  grapefruit juice tastes like?
[5153.79s -> 5154.99s]  Squeeze a grapefruit.
[5156.51s -> 5158.03s]  Squeeze a grapefruit into a glass.
[5159.15s -> 5160.83s]  Water it down with water
[5160.83s -> 5161.79s]  and leave it in the sun.
[5164.30s -> 5168.43s]  Take it back in and add yeast to it and stir it up.
[5169.15s -> 5173.44s]  They tried to market that as some cool beach drink.
[5175.84s -> 5176.80s]  You would just, oh.
[5178.88s -> 5179.92s]  You know that, hold on.
[5179.92s -> 5180.96s]  You know, I hope this is important.
[5180.96s -> 5182.24s]  I haven't been here for like four days.
[5182.24s -> 5183.44s]  You got to let me do this.
[5183.44s -> 5185.92s]  You know they have like a special Budweiser now
[5186.48s -> 5187.20s]  in like a case.
[5192.32s -> 5194.08s]  It's like a Budweiser in a case.
[5197.18s -> 5198.14s]  Why do you have that?
[5201.53s -> 5202.41s]  They're trying to sell it
[5202.41s -> 5206.94s]  as if it's like some special secret beer or something.
[5209.24s -> 5211.32s]  It's like a Bud, Budweiser Reserve.
[5211.32s -> 5217.21s]  No, but wait, the clientele of like Budweiser Red,
[5218.84s -> 5222.04s]  mostly are people that get like in fights at tailgate parties.
[5223.93s -> 5229.21s]  They're not going to buy that.
[5229.21s -> 5231.61s]  I'd be like, this is, that's just the way it is.
[5232.25s -> 5236.20s]  Why don't you just leave?
[5236.20s -> 5237.24s]  I can't.
[5237.24s -> 5238.92s]  I've got to perform.
[5238.92s -> 5240.20s]  They're watching me.
[5240.20s -> 5241.00s]  Who?
[5241.00s -> 5241.50s]  Them.
[5242.36s -> 5244.22s]  I scared myself.
[5247.71s -> 5249.69s]  I scared myself.
[5254.19s -> 5255.23s]  He peaked the mic.
[5255.23s -> 5255.87s]  All right, so long.
[5255.87s -> 5257.47s]  See you around naked Bosco.
[5257.47s -> 5259.55s]  I don't think I'll ever stop seeing you.
[5260.19s -> 5260.83s]  Save me.
[5262.91s -> 5265.15s]  I can only stand girly drinks.
[5266.03s -> 5268.28s]  What, what, what, what does that even classify?
[5271.04s -> 5281.95s]  Okay, so we got nitrous oxide, key card, nitrous into the coffee, but like lime.
[5282.51s -> 5286.16s]  Now we already know that I'm like an alcohol snob.
[5286.16s -> 5287.60s]  You guys already know that.
[5287.60s -> 5289.92s]  You guys have made fun of me extensively for it.
[5290.72s -> 5295.08s]  Let's go check the other ones.
[5295.08s -> 5301.39s]  Jeremy, you can't put gas in a mug.
[5302.19s -> 5306.56s]  If you seal it with fucking rattle's wrap, you can.
[5307.28s -> 5314.30s]  The special Budweiser you're talking about is
[5314.30s -> 5317.02s]  a jolly old elf working hard on his delivery,
[5317.02s -> 5320.46s]  the sound of children playing, and a jolly Christmas jingle.
[5320.46s -> 5322.54s]  How could this possibly be hell?
[5322.54s -> 5324.06s]  Maybe Santa's Jewish?
[5324.06s -> 5324.56s]  Why?
[5325.50s -> 5329.72s]  The 50th anniversary Budweiser is to celebrate the moon landing?
[5330.68s -> 5331.18s]  Why?
[5336.30s -> 5337.02s]  Is it really?
[5337.74s -> 5340.51s]  Is they putting moon rocks in it?
[5343.34s -> 5344.06s]  It's true.
[5346.03s -> 5355.10s]  Oh, hey, we're back.
[5356.96s -> 5357.44s]  Moonshine.
[5357.44s -> 5358.32s]  I've had moonshine before.
[5362.32s -> 5364.32s]  Well, it is a bit warm.
[5364.32s -> 5365.52s]  How did you mention it?
[5366.32s -> 5368.40s]  But I can't worry about that.
[5368.40s -> 5372.64s]  I've got too much work to do recalling this blasted toy.
[5372.64s -> 5376.96s]  But these beastly children are ruining my concentration.
[5377.92s -> 5379.24s]  What the hell?
[5379.72s -> 5381.32s]  Up, up, up, up.
[5381.32s -> 5395.34s]  I feel like that face that was that caterpillar was making
[5395.34s -> 5397.26s]  is just how I feel like all the time.
[5397.26s -> 5399.48s]  Like I'm in hell.
[5399.48s -> 5400.20s]  Right there.
[5400.20s -> 5400.84s]  That one.
[5400.84s -> 5402.04s]  I feel like that's me.
[5402.04s -> 5403.80s]  I love that mood.
[5403.80s -> 5404.28s]  You know what I mean?
[5405.08s -> 5409.00s]  What dangerous toy are you recalling this time?
[5409.00s -> 5412.68s]  It's the Rex Skirmish Danger Hero action figure.
[5412.68s -> 5417.56s]  Completely irresponsible, and it just keeps coming back even worse.
[5418.36s -> 5422.04s]  It's taking me four months just to get them to remove the candy
[5422.04s -> 5424.60s]  flavored lickable lead based chest tattoo.
[5427.31s -> 5427.63s]  OK.
[5427.63s -> 5428.59s]  Well, what's the audio?
[5428.59s -> 5430.51s]  You hate the matter with the babies, Chris.
[5430.51s -> 5431.87s]  Santa loves children.
[5431.87s -> 5437.31s]  Why do people always assume that I took the one job where
[5437.31s -> 5439.23s]  there's only one day a year.
[5439.23s -> 5443.15s]  There's even a chance I'll be near children with very strict
[5443.15s -> 5445.87s]  rules that they're not allowed to see me.
[5445.87s -> 5446.59s]  Holy shit.
[5446.59s -> 5448.19s]  When you put it that way.
[5448.19s -> 5450.03s]  I got fucking woke mood as fuck.
[5450.03s -> 5454.03s]  A hero man like me has been married for centuries with no kids.
[5454.03s -> 5455.55s]  Did you think of that?
[5455.55s -> 5458.83s]  I'm trying really hard not to think about that right now or ever again.
[5461.28s -> 5462.40s]  That is pretty true, though.
[5462.96s -> 5467.66s]  What's going on?
[5467.66s -> 5470.06s]  What kind of miserable work are you doing here, Santa?
[5470.06s -> 5472.22s]  I'm recalling dangerous toys.
[5472.94s -> 5475.52s]  Ah, all the dangerous toys of my years.
[5475.52s -> 5476.32s]  Like laughing gas.
[5476.32s -> 5477.84s]  The savage tongue ripper.
[5477.84s -> 5479.44s]  Little patio fisticuffs.
[5479.44s -> 5481.68s]  The belligerent drunken leprechaun.
[5481.68s -> 5483.44s]  Oh, I remember that one.
[5483.44s -> 5485.20s]  He really wet himself.
[5485.92s -> 5488.72s]  Having to recall toys must be horrible for you.
[5488.72s -> 5489.84s]  Hellish even.
[5489.84s -> 5491.60s]  Oh my, no.
[5491.60s -> 5493.76s]  I love recalling toys.
[5495.28s -> 5500.00s]  The problem is these babies make it impossible to concentrate.
[5501.60s -> 5502.10s]  Okay.
[5502.64s -> 5504.80s]  Have a holly jolly eternal damnation.
[5507.12s -> 5509.20s]  What did I do to deserve this?
[5509.20s -> 5511.12s]  Looks like he's in Jimmy Neutron.
[5511.12s -> 5512.32s]  All right, demon babies.
[5513.12s -> 5515.92s]  Leave the nice Santa alone and let him do his work.
[5515.92s -> 5518.16s]  Santa has not yet learned true suffering.
[5521.45s -> 5522.33s]  Anyone want some coffee?
[5522.33s -> 5522.83s]  Nope.
[5523.45s -> 5525.77s]  Computer.
[5525.77s -> 5526.41s]  Christmas tree.
[5528.48s -> 5531.36s]  This long after Christmas and Santa still got his tree up?
[5532.65s -> 5537.40s]  Hey, it's never a problem and never mind.
[5537.40s -> 5539.72s]  I was going to say like it's not a problem if you leave it up all year
[5539.72s -> 5541.80s]  and then it's Christmas again or something whatever.
[5541.80s -> 5544.44s]  I've fooled with enough toy playing switches for one lifetime.
[5545.40s -> 5548.89s]  Wee!
[5548.89s -> 5550.97s]  Must be one of those Rex skirmish dolls.
[5550.97s -> 5552.65s]  Do your worst, Dr. Despicable.
[5552.65s -> 5554.17s]  You'll never kill Rex skirmish.
[5555.69s -> 5556.19s]  Trampoline?
[5558.33s -> 5560.41s]  Is this trampoline still useless?
[5560.41s -> 5561.85s]  Yep, still useless.
[5562.73s -> 5565.52s]  And anything else?
[5565.52s -> 5566.96s]  It's fun to go back and look at old stuff.
[5566.96s -> 5568.16s]  I don't know how to work it.
[5568.16s -> 5570.48s]  Computers in hell all run Linux.
[5571.44s -> 5572.16s]  Oh wow.
[5572.80s -> 5573.84s]  Programmer joke.
[5574.56s -> 5577.52s]  Ah, this record player brings back memories.
[5577.52s -> 5580.88s]  Oh, you never forget your first semi-successful exorcism.
[5581.60s -> 5582.72s]  We go in Santa's room.
[5582.72s -> 5583.76s]  It's magically sealed.
[5585.88s -> 5587.24s]  Okay, well we have laughing gas.
[5588.20s -> 5591.08s]  Anything else to do here?
[5591.08s -> 5593.16s]  Torture me Elmer, must feel right at home here.
[5604.22s -> 5604.94s]  Want some Santa?
[5605.58s -> 5606.62s]  I don't want to waste it.
[5610.03s -> 5611.23s]  Let's get out of this one.
[5611.23s -> 5617.60s]  Still have a couple more to look at.
[5622.33s -> 5623.13s]  We did this one.
[5623.13s -> 5624.73s]  This one didn't do this one.
[5624.73s -> 5625.77s]  Let's go toy factory.
[5629.60s -> 5633.68s]  Looks like some kind of vaguely familiar hellish toy factory, Max.
[5633.68s -> 5638.00s]  Oh boy, I want to see the assembly line where the injection mold the doll's heads.
[5638.00s -> 5640.56s]  I hear it's strangely hypnotic.
[5640.56s -> 5642.24s]  Oh, there's no assembly line.
[5642.24s -> 5644.96s]  I make all my toys one at a time.
[5644.96s -> 5648.96s]  It's the only way to guarantee each child loves it as much as I do.
[5652.12s -> 5655.32s]  Okay, so this is a Santa competitor.
[5655.32s -> 5661.08s]  I'm going to waste it.
[5662.84s -> 5664.44s]  Oh, this is the casino machine.
[5666.24s -> 5667.44s]  His arm's off.
[5667.44s -> 5668.48s]  Tis but a flesh wound.
[5668.96s -> 5670.84s]  Computer.
[5671.48s -> 5675.37s]  I hope the elf can work this stuff.
[5675.37s -> 5676.41s]  Because I sure can.
[5676.97s -> 5678.01s]  Okay, what else we got in here?
[5681.18s -> 5682.30s]  We have this computer.
[5682.30s -> 5684.06s]  Wait, wait, fire's thing, we sure have in hell.
[5685.10s -> 5685.82s]  No, I can't take it.
[5692.56s -> 5695.76s]  Look, Max, it's our favorite demonically possessed elf.
[5695.76s -> 5699.44s]  Well, maybe not favorite, but he's in the top five at least.
[5699.44s -> 5700.40s]  Oh, hey guys.
[5701.36s -> 5702.56s]  How did you end up here?
[5702.56s -> 5704.80s]  We haven't seen you since the exorcism.
[5704.80s -> 5706.08s]  How'd you end up here?
[5706.08s -> 5707.04s]  I'm not sure.
[5707.04s -> 5710.08s]  When I woke up, I went outside to find Santa.
[5710.08s -> 5713.44s]  But the last thing I saw was a horrible monster.
[5713.44s -> 5714.88s]  I must have fainted.
[5714.88s -> 5717.84s]  When I woke up, I was in this fancy factory.
[5717.84s -> 5720.00s]  I guess Santa gave me another promotion.
[5722.33s -> 5723.45s]  Looks like Charlie Brown.
[5724.33s -> 5725.61s]  You're looking cheper.
[5725.61s -> 5727.61s]  Are you enjoying sending overpriced toys
[5727.61s -> 5729.29s]  out to overprivileged children?
[5729.29s -> 5731.05s]  Oh no, it's awful.
[5731.05s -> 5734.49s]  No matter what I do, my toys keep getting sent back.
[5734.49s -> 5736.25s]  Okay, look, just because you're an elf
[5736.25s -> 5738.25s]  doesn't mean you're good at making toys.
[5738.25s -> 5740.25s]  Stop living the stereotype.
[5740.25s -> 5742.65s]  Oh, I'm pretty good at making toys.
[5742.65s -> 5745.21s]  But what good is that when there are no children
[5745.21s -> 5746.33s]  to enjoy them?
[5746.33s -> 5749.85s]  It's like being in, well, the place where bad people go
[5749.85s -> 5751.45s]  and it's really hot.
[5751.45s -> 5751.95s]  Tampa?
[5752.97s -> 5755.61s]  Oh, he doesn't know.
[5755.61s -> 5756.41s]  He really doesn't know.
[5756.41s -> 5757.85s]  It's the hottest new toy for Christmas.
[5757.85s -> 5760.89s]  The Rex Skirmish Danger Hero action figure.
[5760.89s -> 5764.09s]  He's a testosterone packed champion of the glorious art
[5764.09s -> 5765.77s]  of savage brutality.
[5766.33s -> 5769.53s]  Sounds like someone's overcompensating.
[5769.53s -> 5771.37s]  The head office keeps sending him back,
[5771.45s -> 5773.61s]  but I know I can make him perfect.
[5773.61s -> 5775.37s]  Okay, so can we help?
[5775.37s -> 5778.17s]  Max and I wrote the book on gleefully violent entertainment.
[5778.17s -> 5780.33s]  I'm especially proud of the appendix
[5780.33s -> 5782.33s]  detailing the ripping out thereof.
[5782.89s -> 5784.41s]  Why don't you let us help with your toy?
[5785.45s -> 5787.45s]  Maybe I have been overthinking it.
[5787.45s -> 5790.57s]  Your childish simplicity could be just what I need.
[5790.57s -> 5791.45s]  I live in Tampa.
[5791.45s -> 5792.09s]  Childlike.
[5792.09s -> 5792.81s]  Me too.
[5792.81s -> 5795.45s]  First, what kind of cool outfit should he have?
[5795.45s -> 5796.17s]  Cool outfit.
[5797.61s -> 5799.29s]  Okay, I think we need some info here.
[5800.25s -> 5803.04s]  It's titanium.
[5804.00s -> 5804.88s]  Commando.
[5804.88s -> 5807.36s]  Wait, no, maybe make it naked.
[5808.24s -> 5811.84s]  That makes sense, right?
[5811.84s -> 5813.44s]  He should be all buff and shirtless
[5813.44s -> 5815.84s]  with a big flaming skull tattoo on his chest.
[5815.84s -> 5816.40s]  Done.
[5816.40s -> 5818.88s]  Now, what should his action path attachment be?
[5820.56s -> 5823.39s]  Magic spatula.
[5823.39s -> 5824.43s]  A list of enemies.
[5825.31s -> 5831.18s]  A list of enemies?
[5831.90s -> 5832.94s]  Or a handbag.
[5839.24s -> 5840.04s]  A handbag.
[5842.36s -> 5842.68s]  Tampa.
[5842.68s -> 5843.64s]  Yeah, everyone's from Tampa.
[5843.64s -> 5844.92s]  We're all from Tampa.
[5845.00s -> 5847.32s]  A sequined yet tasteful handbag
[5847.32s -> 5849.64s]  to show he's in touch with his feminine side.
[5849.64s -> 5850.44s]  I can do that.
[5850.44s -> 5852.68s]  Now, what's his tragic flaw?
[5852.68s -> 5854.76s]  What drives him to seek out danger?
[5854.76s -> 5855.96s]  All right, this is Bosco.
[5857.88s -> 5860.14s]  Acid for blood.
[5860.14s -> 5860.78s]  Brain disease.
[5860.78s -> 5861.90s]  Chronic halitosis.
[5863.64s -> 5866.44s]  Didn't Sybil say that she was trying to figure that out?
[5872.83s -> 5874.03s]  Acid for blood.
[5875.53s -> 5876.17s]  Death.
[5876.17s -> 5876.89s]  It's, yeah.
[5877.77s -> 5885.52s]  Because we're going to replace this with the Bosco, I'm assuming.
[5889.68s -> 5892.24s]  He's buried under a mountain of high interest credit card debt
[5892.24s -> 5893.68s]  and outstanding student loans.
[5894.40s -> 5895.20s]  Okay.
[5895.20s -> 5896.72s]  Thanks for the suggestions, guys.
[5896.72s -> 5898.24s]  Well, he keeps on giving us, you know,
[5898.24s -> 5899.20s]  he has plenty of money.
[5899.20s -> 5899.76s]  Never mind.
[5899.76s -> 5900.80s]  Bosco has a lot of money.
[5907.71s -> 5908.43s]  Recalled.
[5914.16s -> 5915.44s]  I made him a trillionaire.
[5916.08s -> 5918.35s]  Yeah, there it goes.
[5918.35s -> 5919.15s]  All right, so let's do this guy.
[5919.87s -> 5921.24s]  Hello, Mr. L.
[5922.81s -> 5924.09s]  We'll help with your toy.
[5924.09s -> 5924.81s]  All right.
[5924.81s -> 5927.37s]  First, what kind of cool outfit should he have?
[5927.37s -> 5927.87s]  Naked.
[5928.73s -> 5930.91s]  He should be all buff and sh-
[5930.91s -> 5931.41s]  Okay.
[5932.91s -> 5934.51s]  A handbag.
[5934.51s -> 5936.83s]  A sequined, yet tasteful, handbag
[5936.83s -> 5938.83s]  to show he's in touch with his feminine son.
[5938.83s -> 5939.71s]  I can do that.
[5939.71s -> 5940.19s]  Okay.
[5940.19s -> 5942.67s]  And acid for blood.
[5942.67s -> 5944.75s]  Highly caustic acid for blood
[5944.75s -> 5947.07s]  and various related digestive disorders.
[5947.07s -> 5948.11s]  Okay, thanks.
[5948.11s -> 5950.03s]  I'll send out the new version right away.
[5959.58s -> 5959.90s]  Hold on.
[5960.54s -> 5963.58s]  That goes into, because Santa has the same shit.
[5963.58s -> 5964.08s]  Hold on.
[5969.31s -> 5970.51s]  Didn't Santa talk about this?
[5974.22s -> 5975.66s]  No, I mean-
[5975.66s -> 5983.76s]  Are these like, are these interconnected?
[5984.76s -> 5985.72s]  They have to be, right?
[5986.28s -> 5993.87s]  Hi there, Santa.
[5994.75s -> 5995.31s]  Yeah, okay.
[5995.31s -> 5997.60s]  So this is, so what's your problem?
[5997.60s -> 5998.88s]  Why don't you soak down again?
[5998.88s -> 6001.68s]  I can't work with these plastic babies
[6001.68s -> 6003.52s]  and I can't get rid of them.
[6003.52s -> 6005.28s]  It's hell!
[6005.28s -> 6006.21s]  Okay.
[6006.99s -> 6007.79s]  What toy are you making?
[6007.79s -> 6009.55s]  Which toy is that you're working on again?
[6009.55s -> 6011.79s]  Some deathtrap called the
[6011.79s -> 6014.43s]  Wrecksturmish Danger Hero doll.
[6014.99s -> 6018.19s]  I'm gonna be recalling the hell out of this one.
[6019.15s -> 6019.65s]  Yeah.
[6020.19s -> 6022.19s]  Okay, so make it so he can't recall it.
[6026.88s -> 6028.24s]  So there's nothing he can recall.
[6032.43s -> 6034.51s]  Everybody knows Santa loves kids.
[6034.51s -> 6036.43s]  Yeah, so much that I moved-
[6036.43s -> 6037.63s]  Yeah, we already heard this.
[6038.51s -> 6040.35s]  He cool, Santa.
[6041.15s -> 6044.36s]  Must be one of those Wrecksturmish dolls.
[6044.36s -> 6046.04s]  To your worst, Dr. Despicable.
[6046.04s -> 6047.48s]  You'll never kill Wrecksturmish!
[6049.28s -> 6051.36s]  How do you know that you're not in hell right now?
[6052.24s -> 6053.12s]  I don't know, could be.
[6054.00s -> 6057.10s]  We can shoot-
[6057.10s -> 6057.60s]  Okay.
[6057.60s -> 6058.10s]  Blood!
[6058.32s -> 6061.84s]  Guess this is the end of old Wrecksturmish!
[6061.84s -> 6062.34s]  Wait, what?
[6062.34s -> 6063.20s]  Geez, Sam!
[6063.20s -> 6064.80s]  If you don't like the gift, just say so next time!
[6064.80s -> 6065.84s]  I just murdered him!
[6068.19s -> 6068.83s]  Acid blood!
[6078.48s -> 6080.56s]  Did you come to enjoy my wonderful toy?
[6082.08s -> 6085.84s]  I thought I'd never be rid of those blasted types!
[6086.40s -> 6087.44s]  Why am I just dumping-
[6088.88s -> 6089.38s]  Alright.
[6091.33s -> 6092.61s]  I'm not pressing that button.
[6092.61s -> 6093.11s]  He is.
[6094.30s -> 6096.62s]  Oh, listen to that silence!
[6097.58s -> 6098.62s]  It's heaven!
[6099.42s -> 6101.44s]  Okay.
[6101.98s -> 6103.74s]  So, we've made-
[6106.82s -> 6108.74s]  Thank you, Sam and Max.
[6108.74s -> 6110.74s]  You have been very good boys.
[6110.74s -> 6111.94s]  Is that Santa's souls?
[6111.94s -> 6114.66s]  But as long as Satan owns our souls, we have to stay put!
[6115.38s -> 6116.26s]  Okay, so we got two.
[6117.76s -> 6118.56s]  Hell efficiency.
[6118.56s -> 6120.00s]  Oh, we're losing efficiency!
[6120.00s -> 6120.50s]  Okay.
[6122.02s -> 6122.52s]  Ooh!
[6123.70s -> 6125.87s]  Let's go down to the cooking show.
[6133.14s -> 6137.94s]  Now, my next dish is based on a favorite recipe of Grandpa Stinky's.
[6140.42s -> 6142.98s]  Which I'm taking to the ninth circle of hell.
[6143.86s -> 6148.42s]  To the base of milk and pickle juice, just add a little chocolate covered horseradish.
[6152.13s -> 6153.17s]  That was an emerald.
[6153.17s -> 6154.13s]  That was an-
[6154.13s -> 6155.49s]  Some of you guys don't know about emerald.
[6158.74s -> 6160.42s]  Emerald is who made cooking shows.
[6160.42s -> 6160.92s]  Cool.
[6162.42s -> 6170.14s]  Alright, so we got coffee, nitrous oxide, book display.
[6170.14s -> 6171.50s]  Growing up stinky.
[6171.50s -> 6172.86s]  The early years.
[6172.86s -> 6176.86s]  Trashy celebrity biographies and hell are a natural combination.
[6176.86s -> 6178.30s]  Everybody knows emerald?
[6178.30s -> 6179.02s]  I don't think so.
[6179.02s -> 6180.94s]  That was like 15 years ago.
[6184.61s -> 6188.93s]  Emerald has not been really on TV in more than almost a decade and a half.
[6189.65s -> 6191.90s]  Alright, we got Stinky's-
[6191.90s -> 6193.02s]  Stinky's baby book.
[6193.74s -> 6195.36s]  Okay.
[6195.36s -> 6196.70s]  What about bucket of lard?
[6197.26s -> 6199.50s]  I don't think I can eat lard on my diet.
[6202.03s -> 6203.55s]  Emerald Lagasse.
[6203.55s -> 6204.91s]  Oh, microphone.
[6206.18s -> 6208.42s]  Yes, I have a question for Miss Stinky.
[6208.50s -> 6211.46s]  Your seven layer bars turn my stool bright orange.
[6211.46s -> 6212.26s]  Is that normal?
[6212.82s -> 6214.26s]  You will pay for your insolence.
[6217.04s -> 6217.76s]  What about the cure?
[6217.76s -> 6219.20s]  The cooler's not for food.
[6219.20s -> 6221.76s]  It's for the inevitable organ transplants following the show.
[6221.76s -> 6222.48s]  Put something in the food?
[6223.44s -> 6224.48s]  Sticky tar cake.
[6225.04s -> 6226.00s]  Oh, here it is.
[6226.64s -> 6227.60s]  Tar cake sample.
[6227.60s -> 6230.00s]  That's one of the few things that's not better with tar.
[6230.00s -> 6233.06s]  Oh, fuck.
[6233.94s -> 6235.62s]  Okay, well, let's talk to Stinky.
[6235.62s -> 6236.58s]  Well, well, well.
[6236.58s -> 6240.34s]  So you're finally paying the price for offing your own grandpa, huh, Stinky?
[6240.34s -> 6243.38s]  Do not interfere with my plan, Saturday Max.
[6243.38s -> 6245.94s]  Uh, do you need a lozenge or something?
[6245.94s -> 6248.10s]  Ah, that's not our Stinky, Max.
[6248.10s -> 6250.74s]  It's just a demon cleverly disguised as her.
[6250.74s -> 6251.46s]  Go away.
[6254.59s -> 6256.75s]  Making food for Michael's birthday.
[6256.75s -> 6257.31s]  What's cooking?
[6258.43s -> 6261.47s]  I've been wondering when you two would show up.
[6261.47s -> 6262.75s]  He remembered us.
[6265.30s -> 6267.06s]  See, we were killed.
[6267.06s -> 6269.38s]  Girl Stinky really did murder you.
[6269.38s -> 6272.74s]  Maybe next time a couple of travelers from the future come to you with a warning,
[6272.74s -> 6273.78s]  you'll pay attention.
[6274.42s -> 6276.82s]  Murdered my impacted colon.
[6276.82s -> 6281.22s]  It was not but a mountain climbing accident that felled old Stinky.
[6281.22s -> 6287.81s]  I'm getting a lot of references to, like, the last three days in this episode.
[6287.81s -> 6288.37s]  It's weird.
[6290.50s -> 6293.30s]  Did you say you were killed in a mountain climbing accident?
[6293.30s -> 6297.70s]  Aye, I was in the Himalayas halfway up the north face of the devil's nipple
[6297.70s -> 6300.66s]  when Mr. Port Cables just fell off.
[6300.66s -> 6303.86s]  If only someone had developed a better adhesive.
[6305.54s -> 6307.46s]  Interesting how those things work, yeah.
[6307.46s -> 6308.34s]  How's hell treating you?
[6308.34s -> 6309.78s]  Your hell is just being on a TV show.
[6309.78s -> 6310.58s]  You doing good?
[6310.58s -> 6315.46s]  I thought for sure a mean old coot like you would end up buried up to your neck in poo or something.
[6315.46s -> 6317.38s]  Yeah, this doesn't seem so bad.
[6317.38s -> 6318.42s]  Not bad.
[6318.42s -> 6321.78s]  Just look at that crowd hanging on her every word.
[6321.78s -> 6327.78s]  And they've got the nerve to reduce me to her, to her sous chef.
[6327.78s -> 6332.02s]  I can't appreciate a real genius of the culinary dark art.
[6332.02s -> 6333.46s]  Culinary dark arts.
[6337.28s -> 6338.56s]  Does that just mean you burn everything?
[6341.34s -> 6341.58s]  Right?
[6344.78s -> 6346.70s]  Like, what would be, like, the bad thing to do?
[6349.36s -> 6351.68s]  So what is the deal between you and girl Stinky anyway?
[6351.68s -> 6352.32s]  Evil cooking.
[6352.32s -> 6354.40s]  Yeah, you just leave it in the oven too long.
[6354.40s -> 6359.92s]  I made her what she is today, but now they call me her apprentice.
[6362.08s -> 6363.04s]  Making mac and cheese?
[6364.58s -> 6365.94s]  Hold on, you making mac and cheese?
[6367.68s -> 6368.56s]  Give us the recipe.
[6369.68s -> 6372.40s]  This stream is not gonna go forward until you say how you're making it.
[6373.87s -> 6377.55s]  I hope you don't say, like, box orange mac and cheese.
[6377.55s -> 6378.83s]  I want to hear the real recipe.
[6383.14s -> 6385.22s]  Don't say box orange mac and cheese.
[6392.26s -> 6393.94s]  Kraft mac and cheese with barbecue sauce.
[6393.94s -> 6394.98s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6395.54s -> 6397.49s]  What if it is in the box?
[6397.49s -> 6398.05s]  Don't do that.
[6400.35s -> 6401.47s]  It's Kraft shells and cheese.
[6401.47s -> 6403.87s]  No, you look at one cheese plus three noodles.
[6404.82s -> 6405.06s]  What?
[6405.70s -> 6409.25s]  So Stinky's got her own show.
[6409.25s -> 6410.53s]  What's the big deal?
[6410.53s -> 6415.57s]  Every second this show stays on the air is like swallowing another handful of
[6415.57s -> 6421.09s]  acid dipped razor blades, twisting and churning in my gut.
[6421.09s -> 6422.53s]  Well, as long as you aren't bitter.
[6425.74s -> 6428.94s]  I actually love the boxed orange mac and cheese.
[6429.74s -> 6432.80s]  We'll let you get back to the show.
[6433.36s -> 6434.88s]  Yeah, we can't wait to try it.
[6434.88s -> 6435.92s]  It's like, I love it.
[6440.72s -> 6442.64s]  I told you guys this a long time ago.
[6442.64s -> 6444.80s]  Everything I say is not like 90.
[6444.80s -> 6448.00s]  I don't even need to say the fucking thing you already know.
[6448.80s -> 6452.00s]  Okay, so I got a book out of the fridge.
[6453.17s -> 6454.45s]  It's just for show.
[6454.45s -> 6455.65s]  But what a show it is.
[6456.29s -> 6459.66s]  I can't leave.
[6459.66s -> 6460.06s]  Can I?
[6460.78s -> 6462.30s]  It's magically sealed.
[6462.30s -> 6465.55s]  All right.
[6465.55s -> 6467.30s]  Well, let's try this.
[6470.05s -> 6475.06s]  Hey, hey, what was that?
[6475.70s -> 6478.80s]  What was that guy doing in here?
[6478.80s -> 6480.96s]  Hey, someone opened the two teeth drawer.
[6480.96s -> 6481.44s]  Two teeth.
[6481.44s -> 6481.76s]  Wow.
[6481.76s -> 6483.92s]  Jimmy's personal file is huge.
[6483.92s -> 6486.72s]  He must have been committing a dozen unpardonable sins a week.
[6488.72s -> 6490.72s]  We got Jimmy's file.
[6491.68s -> 6494.99s]  Okay, let's go to the car.
[6495.07s -> 6495.55s]  Try this.
[6499.47s -> 6500.59s]  Shells and cheese is better.
[6502.91s -> 6504.75s]  This is as fast as it goes a little buddy.
[6506.35s -> 6507.78s]  So can I use?
[6508.58s -> 6510.10s]  I have to go back to like the real world.
[6516.93s -> 6517.89s]  Shells and cheese is better.
[6518.93s -> 6520.61s]  Well, I can't.
[6520.61s -> 6520.93s]  I'm sorry.
[6520.93s -> 6522.29s]  I cannot give you an opinion on that.
[6522.85s -> 6523.65s]  It depends on the day.
[6525.31s -> 6526.91s]  Sometimes you feel like shells.
[6526.91s -> 6528.51s]  Sometimes you feel like elbow macaroni.
[6528.51s -> 6529.79s]  Sometimes you feel like rigatoni.
[6531.39s -> 6534.67s]  I'm not going to be like a pasta narcissist here.
[6536.51s -> 6539.31s]  We've taken a tremendous hit in efficiency.
[6539.31s -> 6542.35s]  Are we going to have to demote you back to hourly?
[6542.99s -> 6544.03s]  No, no, no, no, sir.
[6544.03s -> 6545.47s]  I'll do better.
[6545.47s -> 6548.03s]  Hey, Lucifer, we want to talk to you.
[6548.67s -> 6549.07s]  What?
[6549.07s -> 6550.27s]  I'm quite busy.
[6550.27s -> 6552.51s]  Settle in an appointment with my secretary.
[6552.51s -> 6554.27s]  Man, six years a jerk.
[6554.27s -> 6555.55s]  Who does he think he is?
[6556.11s -> 6558.51s]  We're going to have to do some more damage to get his attention.
[6559.95s -> 6563.07s]  Okay, so let me go back to the car.
[6564.27s -> 6565.54s]  No, get back in here.
[6572.19s -> 6581.22s]  Cheese, it's I mean, people crumble crackers,
[6581.22s -> 6583.14s]  cheese, it's and stuff on their mac and cheese.
[6587.26s -> 6590.14s]  That's, I mean, I don't see an issue with that.
[6592.08s -> 6594.32s]  Baked macaroni, bread crumbs.
[6595.55s -> 6596.59s]  Let me go up here.
[6597.15s -> 6605.79s]  He said cheese, it's in milk.
[6606.43s -> 6609.01s]  Yeah, but I selectively read the first half of that.
[6609.01s -> 6613.01s]  Well, is this going to work?
[6618.38s -> 6618.86s]  I can't.
[6618.86s -> 6619.90s]  The de Soto's dead.
[6621.18s -> 6633.14s]  I don't want to waste it.
[6633.14s -> 6634.34s]  What are you guys doing here?
[6634.34s -> 6636.26s]  How'd you get back up here so fast?
[6636.26s -> 6638.34s]  Guys, I'm omnipresent.
[6638.34s -> 6640.02s]  Now, keep it down.
[6640.02s -> 6642.66s]  These mortals can't see or hear me.
[6642.66s -> 6643.70s]  Please death.
[6643.70s -> 6645.30s]  You can't take Timmy.
[6645.30s -> 6647.14s]  He ain't never hurt nobody.
[6651.49s -> 6653.89s]  Okay, how did, how could he be so cruel?
[6653.89s -> 6657.65s]  You wouldn't be so cruel as to take poor tiny Timmy away, would you?
[6657.65s -> 6658.69s]  Just look at that kid.
[6659.25s -> 6662.69s]  He's got the life expectancy of a tomato and a knife commercial.
[6662.69s -> 6664.13s]  Heartless fiend.
[6664.13s -> 6664.85s]  Can I watch?
[6665.49s -> 6667.57s]  I don't see what everybody's so upset about.
[6668.13s -> 6669.97s]  He's going to a better place than this one.
[6670.69s -> 6672.37s]  That doesn't really narrow it down much.
[6673.01s -> 6674.69s]  Heaven, dimwit.
[6675.57s -> 6675.97s]  Heaven?
[6676.85s -> 6679.58s]  Timmy seems like he's a heaven kid.
[6679.58s -> 6680.94s]  Why not give him a break?
[6680.94s -> 6682.46s]  It's out of my control.
[6682.46s -> 6685.42s]  He could go at any moment, but don't worry.
[6685.42s -> 6689.02s]  The kid with his permanent record is definitely going to heaven.
[6689.02s -> 6689.90s]  Permanent record.
[6690.70s -> 6693.26s]  Well, weren't you just down there looking at records?
[6695.09s -> 6696.45s]  How's the death business going?
[6696.93s -> 6698.61s]  Finally slowed down.
[6698.61s -> 6700.53s]  Now that those rats have shuffled off.
[6701.25s -> 6705.25s]  But it'd be easier if I didn't have to cover every death myself.
[6705.25s -> 6706.29s]  Can I go take another?
[6706.29s -> 6708.37s]  Assistant or partner would help everything.
[6710.30s -> 6711.98s]  Yeah, that's what you think at first.
[6712.62s -> 6714.56s]  Well, you got a lot of work to do.
[6714.56s -> 6717.04s]  You've got to take care of everybody that dies all by yourself.
[6717.60s -> 6720.00s]  No, it's not as bad as it sounds.
[6720.00s -> 6722.00s]  All my travel and expenses are covered.
[6725.18s -> 6726.62s]  How did you even get up here?
[6726.62s -> 6727.98s]  I'm looming.
[6728.86s -> 6730.14s]  Part of the job description.
[6732.10s -> 6733.06s]  Take it easy, Harry.
[6733.70s -> 6735.78s]  So I've got Jimmy's file.
[6736.50s -> 6737.54s]  Nothing doing.
[6737.54s -> 6738.58s]  Can I give Jimmy's file?
[6740.10s -> 6742.02s]  It's Timmy Two Teeth's permanent record.
[6742.66s -> 6744.58s]  Looks like he's led a pretty sin-free life.
[6744.58s -> 6745.54s]  So we're going to swap these.
[6745.54s -> 6746.90s]  I always knew that kid was all talk and no action.
[6746.90s -> 6747.94s]  Why are we doing this?
[6749.39s -> 6751.79s]  Doesn't that seem like very bad?
[6751.79s -> 6753.87s]  Hands off that permanent record.
[6753.87s -> 6754.59s]  We're going to get rid of him.
[6754.59s -> 6757.79s]  By the looks of this kid, I'm going to be needing that any minute.
[6757.79s -> 6759.87s]  There's still a chance he'll pull through, right?
[6760.27s -> 6762.11s]  Uh, sure.
[6763.23s -> 6766.16s]  Okay, so how do we get rid of him?
[6766.16s -> 6767.12s]  How do we make him leave?
[6767.12s -> 6767.92s]  Somebody else's die?
[6772.48s -> 6777.44s]  I need 20 milligrams of monosodium glutamate, staff.
[6777.44s -> 6779.68s]  How come there's only one rat here?
[6779.68s -> 6782.00s]  We're not very good at medicine, apparently.
[6783.52s -> 6784.80s]  It's really good to see.
[6786.77s -> 6791.33s]  All right, uh, and they can't upgrade the soda.
[6791.89s -> 6797.01s]  Nitrous speed upgrade is only for vehicles in working condition.
[6797.01s -> 6799.57s]  We're sorry, but your vehicle is completely free.
[6799.57s -> 6801.25s]  I have to bring the vehicle back to life.
[6802.45s -> 6805.38s]  Okay, I already got nitrous.
[6805.38s -> 6806.66s]  So long, cops.
[6806.66s -> 6807.54s]  Stay virtuous.
[6808.42s -> 6809.94s]  He has a mustache body.
[6809.94s -> 6810.74s]  How are you holding up, Timmy?
[6810.74s -> 6811.30s]  What does that even mean?
[6811.30s -> 6811.94s]  Who's that?
[6813.22s -> 6813.94s]  An angel?
[6815.22s -> 6816.10s]  A mustache body?
[6816.10s -> 6817.78s]  He ain't got much time left.
[6817.78s -> 6821.38s]  He's starting to hallucinate and the Tourette's is getting worse.
[6821.94s -> 6823.46s]  What's that, St. Peter?
[6824.58s -> 6828.42s]  Why, yes, I'd love to play with you.
[6834.46s -> 6837.10s]  Okay, well, obviously we have to get that file.
[6837.10s -> 6838.30s]  We got to swap it or something.
[6839.10s -> 6840.80s]  Let's go in here.
[6852.82s -> 6853.78s]  Hey, Sybil.
[6853.78s -> 6854.82s]  How are things?
[6854.82s -> 6856.66s]  Do I have anything I can do with you in here?
[6856.66s -> 6858.10s]  It's been a while since we've last spoken.
[6860.51s -> 6862.35s]  Can we give you anything for the wedding?
[6862.35s -> 6864.75s]  We kept one of the zombie's arms that fell off.
[6864.75s -> 6866.59s]  It's old and kind of blue now.
[6866.59s -> 6867.55s]  You want to borrow it?
[6867.55s -> 6870.19s]  That's a lovely offer, but no thanks.
[6873.31s -> 6875.71s]  Why can't we be in the wedding party from Max and me?
[6875.71s -> 6877.15s]  As president of the U.S.
[6877.15s -> 6878.59s]  and high priest of the ocean,
[6878.59s -> 6880.83s]  chance spiritually to conduct the ceremony.
[6880.83s -> 6881.71s]  Oops.
[6881.71s -> 6883.07s]  How to put this tactfully?
[6883.87s -> 6884.83s]  Yeah, we already did that one.
[6884.83s -> 6885.23s]  All right, so.
[6885.23s -> 6886.03s]  Good luck, Sybil.
[6890.21s -> 6894.13s]  Key card, Stinky's book, coffee, hell coffee.
[6894.13s -> 6895.25s]  I'm not sharing it.
[6895.25s -> 6896.93s]  Gonna have my cup of joe.
[6897.01s -> 6898.21s]  What do I need this coffee for?
[6901.90s -> 6906.22s]  Jimmy's file, gun.
[6907.87s -> 6909.31s]  Don't judge me for this, Max.
[6909.31s -> 6910.35s]  It's for his own good.
[6911.23s -> 6912.11s]  Bless you.
[6922.27s -> 6925.07s]  All right, monster, monster.
[6926.03s -> 6928.03s]  I've never handled a monster before.
[6928.03s -> 6928.67s]  Hey.
[6928.67s -> 6931.79s]  I'll have to figure out how this works exactly.
[6931.79s -> 6933.07s]  I missed your opportunity.
[6933.07s -> 6934.91s]  I'm back and I'm knocking.
[6937.41s -> 6938.85s]  Holy running, Oswald.
[6938.85s -> 6939.65s]  Get that reference.
[6940.29s -> 6953.89s]  Thank you.
[6953.89s -> 6955.65s]  It's Timmy Two Teeth's permanent record.
[6956.29s -> 6958.69s]  Looks like he's led a pretty sin-free life.
[6958.69s -> 6961.65s]  I always knew that kid was all talk and no action.
[6963.63s -> 6964.03s]  Swap.
[6964.67s -> 6968.19s]  For your own good, kid.
[6968.19s -> 6970.27s]  It'll make the eulogy more interesting.
[6970.27s -> 6972.19s]  What did you do?
[6972.19s -> 6974.18s]  Give that back.
[6974.18s -> 6974.66s]  Settle down.
[6975.30s -> 6977.62s]  The doctor said if you exert yourself,
[6988.67s -> 6989.71s]  a simple straight.
[6989.71s -> 6991.15s]  That's terrible.
[6991.23s -> 6994.19s]  Let me just look at his file and we can go straight off.
[6994.19s -> 6995.07s]  That's so bad.
[6995.07s -> 6997.74s]  Hello.
[6997.74s -> 6999.66s]  Really, this kid's file?
[6999.66s -> 7000.70s]  Harry, please.
[7000.70s -> 7003.26s]  You can't expect us to do your job for you.
[7003.26s -> 7005.10s]  I swore it was smaller.
[7005.10s -> 7007.58s]  Kid must have really been busy on his death bed.
[7007.58s -> 7009.10s]  You should have seen it.
[7009.10s -> 7012.14s]  It was like every single letter ever written to Hot Bunny
[7012.14s -> 7015.02s]  combined into one debaucherous rampage.
[7015.02s -> 7015.90s]  Oh, well.
[7015.90s -> 7017.82s]  You can tell me about it on the way to hell then.
[7018.38s -> 7018.88s]  Later.
[7020.22s -> 7020.78s]  My God.
[7021.74s -> 7023.34s]  He's in a bad place now.
[7023.34s -> 7024.46s]  Just kidding.
[7024.46s -> 7025.10s]  He's in hell.
[7025.74s -> 7026.86s]  Oh, my God.
[7026.86s -> 7027.58s]  That's terrible.
[7028.54s -> 7029.42s]  Holy shit.
[7030.14s -> 7031.02s]  Do you want a book or something?
[7031.02s -> 7033.10s]  I don't think anyone wants to hear about Stinky's early years.
[7033.74s -> 7035.18s]  How are you holding up, Jimmy?
[7035.18s -> 7036.22s]  I'll just say you,
[7038.54s -> 7040.30s]  Timmy would have wanted it that way.
[7041.34s -> 7043.97s]  Well, okay.
[7043.97s -> 7045.25s]  So long, cops.
[7045.25s -> 7046.13s]  Go back to hell.
[7047.09s -> 7048.75s]  I need to bring the car back to life.
[7056.51s -> 7057.95s]  You've watched every stream?
[7058.67s -> 7059.71s]  For the past month?
[7061.26s -> 7061.76s]  What's up?
[7062.46s -> 7065.63s]  That's all really I have to say.
[7066.27s -> 7069.54s]  Can I do anything with it if this thing works for everyone?
[7072.46s -> 7080.46s]  Oh, it dodged.
[7081.02s -> 7095.06s]  Is that a colonoscopy reference?
[7095.06s -> 7096.82s]  How would that be a colonoscopy reference?
[7097.78s -> 7101.78s]  All right.
[7101.78s -> 7102.74s]  Let's go back to the...
[7104.34s -> 7105.47s]  Let me see the efficiency.
[7106.19s -> 7110.64s]  This is the first stream I've watched in a month.
[7110.64s -> 7111.28s]  Welcome back.
[7112.90s -> 7113.86s]  We're happy to have you.
[7114.74s -> 7120.56s]  Nice to meet you.
[7123.55s -> 7134.00s]  Usamemac streams are my favorite.
[7134.88s -> 7136.24s]  Well, I'm glad you like them.
[7136.88s -> 7137.68s]  It's a fun game.
[7138.24s -> 7138.48s]  All right.
[7138.48s -> 7140.40s]  So we've got hell.
[7140.40s -> 7141.44s]  No more two teeth.
[7141.44s -> 7142.88s]  We've got efficiency down.
[7143.68s -> 7148.26s]  This is the last stream I've watched.
[7148.26s -> 7148.90s]  Well, it is.
[7148.90s -> 7151.46s]  This is currently the last stream you have watched.
[7152.94s -> 7157.36s]  Unless you have like three streams open at the same time.
[7160.38s -> 7162.86s]  And even if you have like four or five streams open,
[7163.50s -> 7165.42s]  I'm the person that you're listening to right now.
[7165.90s -> 7167.98s]  I'm the last streamer you've heard.
[7170.64s -> 7174.16s]  So, I mean, they just talked, but I'm talking now.
[7174.16s -> 7175.84s]  So I'm still the last thing you've heard.
[7175.84s -> 7179.71s]  What a waste.
[7179.71s -> 7179.95s]  No, no.
[7179.95s -> 7180.91s]  Can I just put it in there?
[7183.41s -> 7185.09s]  This ought to boost the DeSoto spirit.
[7185.73s -> 7189.38s]  Taint just shrunk to the perfect size when I put it in.
[7189.38s -> 7190.50s]  Now that's efficiency.
[7190.50s -> 7191.62s]  So now it's alive, right?
[7191.62s -> 7193.14s]  Well, should we check it out?
[7193.14s -> 7194.42s]  Cruising the endless...
[7194.42s -> 7195.30s]  Let me just check it out.
[7203.95s -> 7204.43s]  This is a...
[7206.82s -> 7206.98s]  Go.
[7209.12s -> 7209.84s]  Wow.
[7209.84s -> 7210.24s]  Jump.
[7210.24s -> 7210.80s]  Go for jump.
[7211.52s -> 7214.77s]  That didn't work.
[7222.59s -> 7223.71s]  Are you supposed to do this?
[7225.95s -> 7227.71s]  Are we going into Bosco's painting?
[7228.75s -> 7231.49s]  Are we about to save Bosco?
[7233.14s -> 7233.62s]  Holy shit.
[7251.22s -> 7254.98s]  My mom walked in when I was watching Naked Bosco.
[7270.70s -> 7272.14s]  All right, we got Bosco's soul.
[7275.82s -> 7278.98s]  Hill efficiency is almost down to red.
[7280.11s -> 7282.83s]  We need to do the cooking show.
[7282.83s -> 7284.59s]  We've got to do something with the cooking show.
[7286.02s -> 7287.38s]  I've got the baby book.
[7287.38s -> 7288.98s]  I've got the coffee.
[7290.34s -> 7291.14s]  We're almost there.
[7292.80s -> 7297.02s]  And we'll find out real soon after I take a piss.
[7297.82s -> 7299.26s]  Don't go anywhere.
[7299.26s -> 7300.46s]  Well, go pee.
[7300.46s -> 7302.30s]  But take me with you, though.
[7302.30s -> 7304.62s]  You know, if you're on, like, a phone or an iPad or, like,
[7304.62s -> 7306.46s]  you have to get to take the whole thing into the bathroom.
[7307.10s -> 7308.06s]  Just like, no, no, no, take...
[7310.34s -> 7310.74s]  Never mind.
[7310.74s -> 7312.34s]  I'll be back in two minutes.
[7513.28s -> 7516.11s]  Okay, we are back.
[7516.11s -> 7519.17s]  Did you miss me?
[7519.97s -> 7526.21s]  So cooking show diorama.
[7526.21s -> 7528.21s]  We need to get the souls out of here.
[7528.21s -> 7533.02s]  I'm not entirely sure how.
[7533.02s -> 7537.17s]  I still haven't done anything with the coffee.
[7537.17s -> 7538.05s]  I'll save this for a...
[7539.01s -> 7540.29s]  I've done Santa's workshop.
[7540.29s -> 7541.09s]  We did the theater.
[7541.09s -> 7542.37s]  We did the toy factory.
[7542.37s -> 7542.93s]  Wait, did we?
[7543.65s -> 7544.45s]  Is he still alive?
[7548.61s -> 7548.93s]  No, he...
[7548.93s -> 7549.41s]  Yeah, no, he...
[7549.41s -> 7551.89s]  Grandpa Stinky looks even more miserable than usual.
[7552.45s -> 7553.73s]  I didn't think it was possible.
[7554.45s -> 7561.47s]  Wait, where is Stinky?
[7563.14s -> 7563.86s]  Oh, she's in here.
[7563.86s -> 7564.36s]  Okay.
[7564.98s -> 7569.71s]  You're gonna put coffee in here?
[7570.67s -> 7571.17s]  Nope.
[7575.14s -> 7580.13s]  Um, I feel like I missed something in this room somehow.
[7580.77s -> 7584.53s]  The rats.
[7584.53s -> 7586.45s]  How are you folks enjoying the show?
[7586.45s -> 7588.93s]  I thought the casino was nice, but this?
[7588.93s -> 7590.13s]  What a treat.
[7590.13s -> 7591.65s]  I ain't no expert on food or nothing,
[7591.65s -> 7593.89s]  but that Stinky's a master chef.
[7593.89s -> 7597.33s]  I think we're gonna have to come down here for vacation every year.
[7597.33s -> 7599.01s]  Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
[7599.01s -> 7599.65s]  Tyrone!
[7602.90s -> 7606.42s]  Now, Miss Stinky, I've warned you about the responsibilities
[7606.42s -> 7608.74s]  that come with hosting a live program.
[7608.74s -> 7610.66s]  It won't happen again, I promise.
[7611.22s -> 7611.72s]  Okay.
[7612.42s -> 7616.50s]  Just keep the language clean and that'd be fabulous.
[7616.50s -> 7619.86s]  I'd hate to have to cancel such a wonderful show.
[7626.13s -> 7626.77s]  Hey, Timmy.
[7627.57s -> 7628.61s]  Hiya, Chimmy.
[7628.61s -> 7630.29s]  Is your soul finally at peace?
[7632.45s -> 7633.41s]  Oh, he's swearing.
[7633.41s -> 7635.97s]  I'm f***ing static to be on stage with such a f***ing...
[7635.97s -> 7636.47s]  Ah-ha!
[7637.25s -> 7637.75s]  Ah-ha!
[7638.53s -> 7639.03s]  Ah-ha!
[7640.05s -> 7641.01s]  What was that?
[7641.65s -> 7642.93s]  What is he doing?
[7642.93s -> 7644.37s]  Calm down, kid.
[7644.37s -> 7647.57s]  Did you taste her f***ed, f***ed, f***ed nutmeg with a f***?
[7647.57s -> 7648.07s]  Whoa.
[7648.85s -> 7650.37s]  Simply divine.
[7650.37s -> 7651.17s]  I don't know if this might be it.
[7651.17s -> 7652.37s]  It's not a kid's game.
[7652.37s -> 7653.91s]  Oh my! Oh no!
[7653.91s -> 7656.07s]  And the smells.
[7656.07s -> 7658.07s]  It's like teen p***.
[7658.07s -> 7658.87s]  Ooh!
[7658.87s -> 7662.15s]  With a f***ed f***.
[7662.15s -> 7664.34s]  I simply cannot allow this.
[7664.90s -> 7666.58s]  This show is cancelled!
[7670.00s -> 7671.28s]  Well, that was exciting.
[7672.24s -> 7676.38s]  What?
[7677.00s -> 7677.88s]  Cancelled.
[7677.88s -> 7680.04s]  You're finally free, Grandpa Stinky.
[7680.04s -> 7681.08s]  Seen her denying it.
[7681.08s -> 7682.20s]  My show got cancelled.
[7682.20s -> 7684.68s]  Made to suffer like I suffered.
[7684.68s -> 7687.48s]  I can't remember when I've been so happy.
[7688.28s -> 7691.16s]  Hmm, was that a happy ending or not?
[7691.16s -> 7692.44s]  I just can't tell anymore.
[7700.12s -> 7703.00s]  I watched all 16 hours of Heroes of Might and Magic.
[7703.00s -> 7703.96s]  But I'm not!
[7703.96s -> 7707.08s]  Until you reprobates get the rights to my soul,
[7707.08s -> 7709.65s]  I still can't leave.
[7709.65s -> 7710.85s]  Well, I've got news for you.
[7711.41s -> 7712.21s]  We're in the red here.
[7712.21s -> 7713.25s]  Looks like we've broken hell.
[7713.25s -> 7714.05s]  Don't worry.
[7714.05s -> 7715.49s]  We can always raise some more.
[7715.49s -> 7716.61s]  Heroes of Might and Magic is...
[7716.61s -> 7718.13s]  I'll let that high and mighty Satan jerk
[7718.13s -> 7720.05s]  won't be too busy to talk to us now.
[7720.93s -> 7722.21s]  Right after this game is over.
[7722.93s -> 7724.77s]  After finishing season two of Sam and Max,
[7724.77s -> 7727.65s]  episode five of the last, this is the final episode,
[7728.29s -> 7731.65s]  I'm going to try to finish that campaign that I was already on.
[7732.21s -> 7735.03s]  This is a two-parter clean-up stream.
[7737.46s -> 7739.22s]  Not a two-parter, it's the same part.
[7739.22s -> 7740.90s]  But okay, now hell is in a turmoil.
[7740.90s -> 7741.70s]  Let's go check it out.
[7747.09s -> 7750.85s]  I was under the impression you were here to increase productivity.
[7751.89s -> 7754.69s]  And yet our efficiency is at an all-time low.
[7754.69s -> 7756.93s]  How do you explain that discrepancy?
[7758.37s -> 7760.13s]  Vladimir, what the hell are you guys talking about?
[7760.13s -> 7761.89s]  We haven't been properly introduced.
[7761.89s -> 7763.17s]  We're Sam and Max.
[7763.17s -> 7765.01s]  You know from the statues.
[7765.01s -> 7766.13s]  Pleased to meet you.
[7766.13s -> 7767.81s]  I hope you've guessed my name.
[7768.45s -> 7771.17s]  Yeah, and you better release our pal souls from hell
[7771.17s -> 7773.49s]  because my excitable little friend is getting angry.
[7773.49s -> 7774.69s]  And I'm angry too.
[7774.69s -> 7776.45s]  There's no need for that kind of talk.
[7776.45s -> 7778.13s]  I'll gladly release your friends.
[7778.77s -> 7780.21s]  Just sign this release.
[7783.14s -> 7784.34s]  And that's that.
[7784.34s -> 7785.62s]  Well, gee, Satan.
[7785.62s -> 7786.18s]  Thanks.
[7786.18s -> 7790.66s]  Now just do me a favor and think of the most horrible thing you can imagine.
[7792.10s -> 7792.82s]  Okay.
[7792.82s -> 7793.54s]  No, wait.
[7793.54s -> 7794.90s]  Let's think of a horrible thing.
[7794.90s -> 7795.70s]  Good.
[7795.70s -> 7796.98s]  Now, off you go.
[7798.10s -> 7799.70s]  Hey, what just happened?
[7799.70s -> 7803.06s]  He traded his soul for that of all your friends.
[7803.70s -> 7806.02s]  They never read the fine print.
[7806.02s -> 7809.86s]  Now, Sam will spend eternity in his own personal hell.
[7810.74s -> 7816.48s]  That's my favorite character.
[7816.48s -> 7818.00s]  Why would you take him away?
[7818.00s -> 7819.68s]  This doesn't seem so bad.
[7819.68s -> 7820.40s]  Right, little buddy?
[7825.43s -> 7826.31s]  Hell's a poppin'.
[7829.59s -> 7831.75s]  No, you took away the best character
[7831.75s -> 7834.79s]  and you replaced it with the worst character.
[7834.79s -> 7840.37s]  Look, I'm sad too.
[7840.37s -> 7840.93s]  Wait, hold on.
[7842.40s -> 7843.36s]  It's busted.
[7843.36s -> 7845.92s]  There shall be no letting off of steam in hell.
[7845.92s -> 7852.00s]  No, at least a hell of my stuff.
[7852.64s -> 7854.80s]  At least I can bring my stuff to hell with me.
[7855.60s -> 7860.24s]  A saw?
[7860.24s -> 7860.96s]  A bone saw?
[7862.20s -> 7863.88s]  Hey, a bone saw.
[7863.88s -> 7866.28s]  Gosh, I hope I can find someone's bones to cut.
[7869.11s -> 7870.23s]  Oh, Banang.
[7870.23s -> 7872.55s]  There shall be no quenching of thirst in hell.
[7873.19s -> 7874.07s]  No, he didn't do it.
[7876.23s -> 7877.19s]  Dark board?
[7877.19s -> 7879.51s]  One of these days we're gonna finish that game.
[7879.51s -> 7881.91s]  But I don't like darts, Sam.
[7881.91s -> 7883.43s]  They're dangerous.
[7884.15s -> 7885.83s]  Max, where are you?
[7887.59s -> 7889.32s]  What are you doing here?
[7889.32s -> 7889.96s]  All right, peepers.
[7890.04s -> 7890.52s]  Let's talk.
[7890.52s -> 7892.36s]  What are you talking about?
[7892.36s -> 7894.44s]  I'm your partner and best friend.
[7895.64s -> 7897.96s]  But stop being so silly
[7897.96s -> 7899.96s]  and let's work on our next case.
[7901.38s -> 7903.62s]  What happened to Max and why are you here?
[7903.62s -> 7904.98s]  A likable partner?
[7904.98s -> 7907.30s]  That's ridiculous.
[7907.30s -> 7910.20s]  Always been your best friend
[7910.20s -> 7913.08s]  and I always will be forever.
[7914.68s -> 7919.49s]  You're one of those crafty demons, aren't you?
[7919.49s -> 7920.95s]  Of course not.
[7921.03s -> 7923.11s]  We've been pals since we were little.
[7923.83s -> 7926.87s]  We used to take baths together.
[7926.87s -> 7927.37s]  What?
[7932.45s -> 7933.09s]  We did not.
[7936.28s -> 7937.48s]  I took the whole tub.
[7942.07s -> 7943.75s]  What case are we working on?
[7943.75s -> 7945.35s]  Don't you remember?
[7945.35s -> 7950.79s]  The commissioner wants us to investigate the proposed bill on income tax reform.
[7950.79s -> 7953.04s]  It's fascinating.
[7953.92s -> 7959.57s]  All right, well, let's go, little buddy.
[7959.57s -> 7961.41s]  Let's be off on our new case.
[7961.41s -> 7965.73s]  We can't leave without doing extensive research, silly.
[7965.73s -> 7966.69s]  Oh, all right.
[7968.56s -> 7970.96s]  You direct me up, little buddy.
[7971.60s -> 7974.32s]  But I didn't say anything funny.
[7975.52s -> 7981.81s]  Where's the rest of the noose collection, peepers?
[7981.81s -> 7984.05s]  Who would keep nooses in an office?
[7984.69s -> 7986.21s]  That's just silly.
[7986.85s -> 7988.53s]  Must get Max.
[7989.57s -> 7991.24s]  Hole in the wall.
[7991.24s -> 7991.80s]  Who's in here?
[7991.80s -> 7994.28s]  Stop! Do not look outside!
[7994.28s -> 7995.00s]  Hey, Sam.
[7995.00s -> 7996.44s]  How's it going in there?
[7996.44s -> 7997.56s]  Am I like a dollhouse?
[7997.56s -> 7998.36s]  I remember now.
[7998.36s -> 7999.32s]  You're my partner.
[8000.04s -> 8000.84s]  Well, duh.
[8002.47s -> 8005.24s]  Um, help me.
[8005.24s -> 8006.44s]  You could come in here, little buddy.
[8006.44s -> 8008.44s]  It's the most horrible thing ever.
[8008.44s -> 8011.80s]  Sounds fun, Sam, but I'm too big to fit in the hole.
[8011.80s -> 8012.84s]  Hey, Sam.
[8012.84s -> 8013.96s]  Listen to this.
[8013.96s -> 8014.84s]  It's funny.
[8015.56s -> 8017.32s]  That's what she said.
[8018.68s -> 8019.64s]  Get me out of here.
[8021.68s -> 8023.20s]  Yeah, that was pretty bad.
[8023.20s -> 8024.00s]  That was awful.
[8025.68s -> 8027.28s]  What's going on out there?
[8027.28s -> 8029.52s]  After everybody saw what Satan did to you,
[8029.52s -> 8031.52s]  it got pretty awkward.
[8031.52s -> 8034.48s]  I don't like hell when it gets all tense like this.
[8036.00s -> 8037.28s]  Well, you should be in here.
[8037.28s -> 8038.88s]  Isn't the same without you, Max.
[8038.88s -> 8040.32s]  I'm bored out here, too.
[8042.00s -> 8045.12s]  Can you believe that Satan guy tricking me like that?
[8045.12s -> 8046.96s]  Let's stack onion rings on his horns
[8046.96s -> 8049.04s]  and throw them in the pit where they keep the gluttonous.
[8049.60s -> 8051.36s]  It's that kind of thinking outside the box
[8051.36s -> 8052.88s]  that makes me wish you were my partner.
[8054.34s -> 8055.30s]  Yeah, peepers suck.
[8055.30s -> 8056.66s]  Peepers keeps telling me he's my partner.
[8057.22s -> 8057.94s]  What?
[8057.94s -> 8060.74s]  Nobody tries to steal my sidekick.
[8060.74s -> 8062.90s]  I always thought you were the sidekick.
[8062.90s -> 8064.26s]  Oh, sure thing, Sam.
[8065.70s -> 8066.90s]  My name's first in the title.
[8067.94s -> 8069.54s]  Can't you find a way in here?
[8069.54s -> 8070.98s]  Think tiny thoughts.
[8070.98s -> 8072.26s]  I always do.
[8072.26s -> 8074.66s]  I'm still too big to squeeze through that hole, though.
[8076.28s -> 8076.92s]  Okay.
[8076.92s -> 8077.72s]  Don't go anywhere, Max.
[8077.72s -> 8079.40s]  So I get to get bigger or he has to get smaller?
[8079.40s -> 8080.12s]  Relax, Sam.
[8080.12s -> 8081.56s]  You're getting all weird on me.
[8083.03s -> 8084.39s]  Okay, so that's...
[8084.39s -> 8085.27s]  I'm obviously little.
[8085.99s -> 8088.66s]  Never thought I'd see his ugly mug again.
[8088.66s -> 8090.34s]  Can we leave the office together?
[8092.28s -> 8094.92s]  We can't leave now, Sam.
[8094.92s -> 8097.32s]  It hasn't been eternity yet.
[8099.35s -> 8101.19s]  Turn the lights off and bone saw him?
[8103.96s -> 8106.52s]  Unfortunately, this is a 12-gauge bone saw
[8106.52s -> 8108.36s]  and he's clearly 9-gauge.
[8108.36s -> 8111.28s]  I'm small bones, a big...
[8111.28s -> 8114.10s]  Where's a heart saw when you need one?
[8115.88s -> 8117.16s]  Well, why is this floating here?
[8117.16s -> 8118.84s]  It's taunting me with its precariousness.
[8118.84s -> 8119.64s]  Can I shoot it?
[8119.64s -> 8120.52s]  Can I bone saw it?
[8122.93s -> 8123.41s]  I mean, is this...
[8124.29s -> 8125.57s]  You can't die in hell.
[8125.57s -> 8126.53s]  Missed?
[8126.53s -> 8128.77s]  Satan must have messed up my aim to torment me.
[8129.41s -> 8133.09s]  But you're a lousy shot in real life, too.
[8133.09s -> 8135.81s]  I said Satan must have messed up my aim.
[8136.85s -> 8139.30s]  Can I move the chair?
[8139.30s -> 8141.06s]  Can I stand on the chair and saw the rope?
[8142.77s -> 8143.89s]  I can't reach it.
[8143.89s -> 8145.49s]  Satan just put it there to torment me.
[8146.21s -> 8149.14s]  Arsenic?
[8150.82s -> 8151.38s]  Arsenic.
[8151.94s -> 8154.26s]  I know just the person for this.
[8154.26s -> 8157.22s]  It's past the expiration date, Sam.
[8157.22s -> 8159.78s]  Totally unusable.
[8160.58s -> 8161.70s]  Spoiled poison.
[8161.70s -> 8162.98s]  That's the worst.
[8162.98s -> 8171.99s]  Oh, what do I have here?
[8178.76s -> 8179.24s]  So what?
[8179.24s -> 8180.52s]  Just go get in here.
[8181.16s -> 8185.57s]  Is it gonna work?
[8185.57s -> 8186.77s]  Hey, Max, look alive.
[8187.33s -> 8189.17s]  I'm about to scream yes, but I'm not gonna...
[8189.17s -> 8189.97s]  What do I do with this?
[8189.97s -> 8190.61s]  Don't eat it.
[8190.61s -> 8191.41s]  Just get in here.
[8196.07s -> 8197.59s]  Max, meet Demon Peepers.
[8198.60s -> 8199.72s]  Oh, hi.
[8199.72s -> 8202.52s]  Demon Peepers here says he's my partner and best friend.
[8204.55s -> 8205.96s]  Hey there.
[8205.96s -> 8206.52s]  What are you...
[8206.52s -> 8212.63s]  Oh, God!
[8212.63s -> 8213.27s]  Is that Peepers?
[8213.27s -> 8213.91s]  Hi, Leonard.
[8215.43s -> 8217.59s]  That was some of your best work ever, Max.
[8218.31s -> 8218.79s]  He's dead.
[8218.79s -> 8221.03s]  I'm really proud of what I did around the carotid artery.
[8221.03s -> 8222.47s]  Yes, excellent grouping.
[8223.03s -> 8224.23s]  Shall we motor?
[8224.23s -> 8224.73s]  Let's.
[8233.24s -> 8233.88s]  All right, Satan.
[8234.92s -> 8235.48s]  Boss fight.
[8237.28s -> 8241.20s]  That hell was practically inescapable.
[8241.20s -> 8242.32s]  Sorry, Satan.
[8242.32s -> 8247.04s]  Your demon imposter was no match for the true power of friendship and cooperation.
[8247.04s -> 8248.64s]  Plus I ripped out his kidneys.
[8249.20s -> 8253.12s]  Well, this does put me into a bit of a pickle.
[8253.12s -> 8255.20s]  Management will have my head over this.
[8255.20s -> 8255.92s]  Management?
[8256.80s -> 8261.12s]  Who could possibly be more horrible and universally reviled than Satan?
[8263.09s -> 8263.49s]  Oh...
[8263.49s -> 8265.09s]  Who is Super Satan?
[8265.09s -> 8268.66s]  Oh, it's the...
[8268.66s -> 8269.70s]  It's the Poopers!
[8270.68s -> 8273.40s]  So, you finally figured it out.
[8273.40s -> 8275.24s]  Sure took you long enough.
[8275.24s -> 8277.96s]  I take it you already know, my bosses.
[8278.92s -> 8279.88s]  Know us?
[8279.88s -> 8280.60s]  The soda...
[8280.60s -> 8283.48s]  These fools have been essential to our plans.
[8283.48s -> 8284.20s]  But how did you get...
[8284.20s -> 8284.68s]  But you can't beat Satan.
[8284.68s -> 8285.32s]  When did you...
[8285.56s -> 8286.60s]  What have you got against us?
[8286.60s -> 8287.88s]  And what did we do?
[8287.88s -> 8289.88s]  Please, one question at a time.
[8294.45s -> 8300.63s]  Okay, so the soda team are the rulers of all hell.
[8302.61s -> 8306.93s]  How did you guys go from minor annoyances to become rulers of hell?
[8306.93s -> 8309.09s]  You still don't get it?
[8309.09s -> 8311.73s]  Hate is the real power.
[8311.73s -> 8315.57s]  We thought nothing could be worse than former child stars.
[8315.57s -> 8318.29s]  But that was before we beat Brady Culture to death
[8318.29s -> 8321.73s]  and realized we were destined for much greater evil.
[8321.73s -> 8324.21s]  It just felt so right!
[8324.77s -> 8328.13s]  So we began to commit greater atrocities on the world.
[8328.69s -> 8330.29s]  Reality television.
[8330.29s -> 8331.25s]  Politics.
[8331.81s -> 8333.65s]  The Intelligent Design Movement.
[8334.53s -> 8335.65s]  His eyes are fucked.
[8336.77s -> 8340.13s]  Each step made us more hated and more powerful.
[8342.31s -> 8347.56s]  Okay, what did we ever do to you?
[8347.56s -> 8350.20s]  You only ruined our birthday.
[8350.20s -> 8352.20s]  It was one year ago today.
[8352.84s -> 8356.84s]  You thwarted my journey to evil pop stardom.
[8356.84s -> 8359.32s]  And you gave me some bitter diarrhea.
[8360.20s -> 8362.28s]  And these glasses aren't cheap.
[8363.40s -> 8368.26s]  And worst of all, the Mariachis never came to sing for us.
[8370.12s -> 8374.04s]  Wow, who knew the princes of hell would be such whiny little babies?
[8375.86s -> 8377.06s]  Well, what's with Santa?
[8377.06s -> 8379.22s]  You meant to get Santa possessed by a demon.
[8379.22s -> 8381.46s]  No, that was a clerical error.
[8381.46s -> 8385.22s]  We thought some corporate efficiency would help Satan get his act together.
[8385.22s -> 8389.62s]  But it seems he'll always be antiquated and useless.
[8389.62s -> 8391.62s]  You know I'm standing right here.
[8392.34s -> 8394.66s]  We did mean to kill that elf, though.
[8398.13s -> 8399.17s]  So what's the endgame here?
[8399.17s -> 8400.93s]  It would be better running hell than Satan is.
[8400.93s -> 8402.77s]  The old ways are dying.
[8402.77s -> 8406.13s]  It's time to bring evil into the 21st century.
[8406.13s -> 8409.89s]  Our subcontracting and outsourcing of soul capture and processing
[8409.89s -> 8413.17s]  has increased our efficiency tenfold.
[8413.17s -> 8416.53s]  But we still have to convince the shareholders to believe in hell
[8416.53s -> 8419.17s]  as a relevant player in the afterlife.
[8419.17s -> 8423.57s]  Current marketplace realities and underlying economic considerations
[8423.57s -> 8426.21s]  mean we have to downsize.
[8426.21s -> 8430.13s]  Satan, we kept you on staff for sentimental reasons.
[8430.13s -> 8432.77s]  But your performance continues to disappoint.
[8433.33s -> 8435.57s]  But if you'll give me another chance.
[8436.69s -> 8442.02s]  Clean out your desk and don't come back!
[8442.02s -> 8442.34s]  That was fun!
[8442.34s -> 8443.38s]  What about the other ones?
[8445.24s -> 8446.36s]  What about the other employees?
[8447.00s -> 8449.08s]  We've heard quite enough, thank you.
[8449.08s -> 8449.96s]  Very well.
[8449.96s -> 8452.12s]  Now that you've helped us depose Satan,
[8452.12s -> 8455.64s]  there's nothing stopping us from continuing our agenda
[8455.64s -> 8457.80s]  for domination of the infernal realms!
[8457.80s -> 8459.48s]  Right in the middle of that sentence.
[8459.48s -> 8460.76s]  Thanks, Salmon Max.
[8460.76s -> 8463.96s]  That would have gone flat soul against his nose.
[8463.96s -> 8466.04s]  First action item, seducing a human woman
[8466.04s -> 8466.60s]  and conceiving the new hellspawn.
[8466.60s -> 8468.84s]  Footprint, like crush his face.
[8468.84s -> 8474.12s]  I'm all a second, tempting humanity to repeat the original sin.
[8474.76s -> 8476.44s]  I've got it covered.
[8476.44s -> 8481.08s]  And finally, winning a new modern soul over to hell.
[8481.08s -> 8483.16s]  Because of the technical skill required,
[8483.16s -> 8486.20s]  I'll be handling that one, obviously.
[8486.20s -> 8488.52s]  Thanks for all your help, Salmon Max.
[8491.84s -> 8492.64s]  All right.
[8492.64s -> 8494.80s]  I think unwittingly bringing about the apocalypse
[8494.80s -> 8496.16s]  is a first for us, little buddy.
[8497.68s -> 8499.60s]  Sorry, I completely zoned out there.
[8499.60s -> 8501.28s]  Did they say anything important?
[8501.28s -> 8501.84s]  Never mind.
[8503.96s -> 8505.48s]  Okay, so what we need to do,
[8506.44s -> 8511.35s]  let's go talk to people.
[8512.61s -> 8513.73s]  Got three things.
[8513.73s -> 8515.49s]  Lord, keep up the good work.
[8521.59s -> 8522.55s]  Nobody has any new dialogue?
[8522.55s -> 8526.24s]  Hey, buddy.
[8526.24s -> 8528.24s]  What about that time Jimmy Hoffa said,
[8528.24s -> 8530.16s]  ride the bucking surfboard?
[8530.16s -> 8532.24s]  Bucking is not on the list.
[8532.24s -> 8533.12s]  No, no new dialogue.
[8534.80s -> 8535.60s]  Later, Hugh Bliss.
[8538.87s -> 8539.43s]  That's the list.
[8539.43s -> 8539.67s]  Can I see the list?
[8539.67s -> 8540.87s]  It's a list of swear words.
[8545.64s -> 8546.92s]  Why do they all start with S?
[8547.88s -> 8548.36s]  Listen to that.
[8548.36s -> 8549.32s]  They all start with S.
[8557.65s -> 8558.45s]  Okay.
[8558.45s -> 8562.00s]  So let's go to the new board.
[8563.49s -> 8564.37s]  Action items.
[8564.37s -> 8565.57s]  Conceive Hellspawn.
[8565.57s -> 8566.37s]  Original sin.
[8566.37s -> 8568.07s]  Challenge for soul.
[8568.07s -> 8568.63s]  Two.
[8568.63s -> 8569.43s]  Original sin.
[8570.15s -> 8570.87s]  Three.
[8570.87s -> 8571.75s]  Challenge for soul.
[8572.47s -> 8573.36s]  All right.
[8574.00s -> 8577.86s]  How do we get it?
[8577.86s -> 8579.22s]  How are we going to do original sin?
[8588.29s -> 8591.91s]  What about you?
[8591.91s -> 8592.79s]  Do you have anything new?
[8592.79s -> 8593.59s]  You got a new boss.
[8594.39s -> 8596.31s]  So then I says to Gonza.
[8596.31s -> 8597.27s]  I says, Gonza?
[8598.47s -> 8598.97s]  Yes.
[8601.91s -> 8603.03s]  Help us stop the popper.
[8603.03s -> 8604.79s]  You want to help us get Satan back in charge.
[8605.59s -> 8606.79s]  Why would I do that?
[8607.51s -> 8609.35s]  With that fossil out of the way,
[8609.35s -> 8610.95s]  I'm next in line for the promotion
[8610.95s -> 8612.47s]  at the next shareholders meeting.
[8613.11s -> 8613.99s]  Wish me luck.
[8615.19s -> 8618.47s]  Why didn't you tell us the poppers were your bosses?
[8618.47s -> 8620.55s]  I thought it was obvious.
[8620.55s -> 8621.27s]  You're a liar.
[8621.27s -> 8623.35s]  You actually think someone could be as mean
[8623.35s -> 8625.51s]  and despicable as that by accident?
[8626.87s -> 8629.27s]  You are so slow.
[8629.27s -> 8630.31s]  This is bullshit.
[8630.31s -> 8631.83s]  You said you were going to start season three
[8631.83s -> 8632.39s]  right after this.
[8633.35s -> 8633.75s]  Liar.
[8634.31s -> 8636.48s]  Did you see where Satan went?
[8636.48s -> 8638.88s]  There all the husbands go, I imagine.
[8639.60s -> 8642.16s]  Such disrespect for the prince of darkness.
[8643.36s -> 8645.68s]  Prince of darkness is more like it.
[8647.94s -> 8650.42s]  Well, now we have to wait in line to see the poppers.
[8650.42s -> 8651.70s]  During a lot about the clown car,
[8651.70s -> 8653.06s]  thanks to the five community subs.
[8653.86s -> 8655.46s]  Five community subs from the clown car.
[8656.87s -> 8657.67s]  Thank you for that.
[8658.47s -> 8659.27s]  I want to see the poppers.
[8659.27s -> 8660.55s]  Call the poppers back here.
[8660.55s -> 8663.99s]  They are there on a very important meeting right now.
[8663.99s -> 8665.27s]  If you want to talk to them,
[8665.27s -> 8666.95s]  you'll have to find them for yourself.
[8666.95s -> 8668.47s]  I'm going to go back to the real world.
[8669.43s -> 8671.03s]  See you later, Jorgen.
[8671.03s -> 8671.75s]  Yeah, sure.
[8672.95s -> 8674.47s]  So anyway, then I says.
[8675.51s -> 8677.68s]  Let's head back up.
[8677.68s -> 8678.32s]  Wait, magazines.
[8678.32s -> 8679.52s]  Anything else?
[8680.48s -> 8681.76s]  Stuttgart nightlife.
[8682.40s -> 8685.20s]  Figures the reading material in hell would be two months old.
[8686.24s -> 8687.84s]  Did I play season three off stream?
[8687.84s -> 8688.48s]  I just couldn't.
[8688.48s -> 8689.04s]  I couldn't take it.
[8689.04s -> 8690.00s]  I had to know what happened.
[8691.48s -> 8692.12s]  No.
[8692.12s -> 8705.00s]  Why would I play season three before finishing season two?
[8705.80s -> 8712.48s]  You don't skip a season.
[8716.64s -> 8717.68s]  Just a spike.
[8717.68s -> 8718.32s]  Come on in.
[8718.32s -> 8721.44s]  We're throwing one hell of a bachelor party for Lincoln in here.
[8721.44s -> 8722.96s]  Why would I go and spike you guys?
[8722.96s -> 8724.40s]  I haven't been paying you to party.
[8724.40s -> 8728.32s]  I spent 40 years tracking down the man who trashed my store.
[8728.32s -> 8730.72s]  Hiring the best private investigators.
[8730.72s -> 8732.40s]  It's time you tell me where he is.
[8732.96s -> 8734.56s]  Tell me where he is.
[8735.92s -> 8737.36s]  Well, there he is.
[8738.32s -> 8738.82s]  Bosco?
[8740.48s -> 8742.32s]  You mean you never thought to mention
[8742.32s -> 8744.32s]  that your suspect was my son?
[8744.88s -> 8746.24s]  I thought it was obvious.
[8746.88s -> 8750.08s]  You're the one who's been after me all this time.
[8750.08s -> 8753.52s]  It was all just a simple misunderstanding.
[8754.72s -> 8756.88s]  Yeah, that is pretty dappy.
[8756.88s -> 8759.12s]  A lifetime of persecution.
[8759.12s -> 8761.84s]  All just a simple misunderstanding.
[8763.36s -> 8765.28s]  Hope you're not mad, baby.
[8765.28s -> 8767.92s]  We all go a little mad sometimes, mother.
[8767.92s -> 8771.68s]  Run along to the bunker and I'll be in later with your dinner.
[8771.68s -> 8772.88s]  I'm a ghost, baby.
[8772.88s -> 8773.92s]  I don't eat dinner.
[8773.92s -> 8774.42s]  Just do it!
[8776.56s -> 8777.92s]  Bye, Sam and Max.
[8779.22s -> 8780.74s]  Well, now that case is wrapped up.
[8780.74s -> 8782.10s]  Wow, that was quick.
[8782.10s -> 8783.62s]  You coming, Bosco?
[8783.62s -> 8784.12s]  Party?
[8784.90s -> 8787.14s]  That was just like a disconnected from server.
[8787.14s -> 8788.26s]  No fade out.
[8788.26s -> 8790.98s]  No, like, drifting away.
[8790.98s -> 8792.34s]  Maybe even crazier.
[8793.38s -> 8795.51s]  Okay, well, let's go.
[8797.03s -> 8798.39s]  We got a lot of things going on out here.
[8798.39s -> 8799.75s]  Let's start right to left.
[8805.97s -> 8808.69s]  Well, well, well, specs.
[8808.69s -> 8810.69s]  Just what do you think you're doing here?
[8810.69s -> 8814.61s]  I'm going to do what Satan never had the skills to attempt.
[8814.61s -> 8817.41s]  I'm going to win the soul of a computer.
[8818.77s -> 8820.69s]  Ha, you talk big now.
[8820.69s -> 8823.17s]  But wait until you've heard me play.
[8829.49s -> 8830.21s]  Beat that.
[8830.93s -> 8832.37s]  You can do it.
[8832.37s -> 8834.77s]  Play like you've never played before.
[8834.77s -> 8835.49s]  Come on, Chippy.
[8842.13s -> 8843.25s]  No, I didn't.
[8843.25s -> 8845.41s]  Well, then I'll just be taking-
[8845.41s -> 8846.85s]  Oh, but there's a technicality.
[8847.49s -> 8848.05s]  Right.
[8848.05s -> 8851.65s]  Sub clause 48, section five in the contract clearly states that
[8851.65s -> 8856.45s]  entities running at less than eight megahertz are entitled to infinite do-overs.
[8856.45s -> 8858.21s]  I don't remember reading that.
[8858.77s -> 8860.05s]  Oh, specs.
[8860.05s -> 8864.77s]  A perfectionist like you and you didn't even bother to read the details of the contract?
[8864.77s -> 8865.97s]  Well, all right.
[8865.97s -> 8867.09s]  It doesn't matter.
[8867.09s -> 8868.21s]  I'll still win.
[8869.57s -> 8875.01s]  Okay, so first of all, five community subs came in from anonymous, whoever you are.
[8875.89s -> 8878.58s]  Thank you for the five subs.
[8879.06s -> 8882.58s]  Whoever you are, whoever the sacred person is.
[8883.30s -> 8884.10s]  All right, Chippy.
[8884.10s -> 8885.46s]  Don't you know any better songs to play?
[8885.46s -> 8886.10s]  It's kind of important.
[8886.10s -> 8887.22s]  We've got to get Chippy some music.
[8887.70s -> 8889.70s]  He's just too set in his ways.
[8890.18s -> 8891.70s]  We've got to get Chippy a-
[8891.70s -> 8894.42s]  We've got to get Chippy a video game cartridge from down below.
[8894.98s -> 8895.78s]  Stick it in there.
[8896.42s -> 8897.80s]  Right?
[8897.80s -> 8898.60s]  I mean, that's what I think.
[8898.60s -> 8899.56s]  Dump coffee on him.
[8899.56s -> 8900.52s]  No, that would just break him.
[8901.16s -> 8902.36s]  Hey, cops, what's shaking?
[8902.84s -> 8905.64s]  Specs has challenged us to a musical contest.
[8905.64s -> 8907.08s]  Yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[8907.80s -> 8910.68s]  Solid gold violin.
[8910.68s -> 8913.48s]  Second prize, eternal damnation.
[8915.24s -> 8917.72s]  Who'd be stupid enough to take on that kind of challenge?
[8919.16s -> 8921.08s]  We cannot talk him out of it.
[8921.80s -> 8925.72s]  Okay, so, hey, we want you to upgrade our car.
[8927.17s -> 8928.93s]  We want to upgrade our car.
[8928.93s -> 8932.85s]  We're sorry, but your car already has the nitrous upgrade installed.
[8933.57s -> 8936.77s]  He's just afraid to go near me.
[8936.77s -> 8938.08s]  Okay.
[8938.08s -> 8939.36s]  So long, cops.
[8939.44s -> 8940.32s]  Stay virtuous.
[8941.12s -> 8944.88s]  So, I've got to get the cartridge to put in there from down in the cartridge pile.
[8946.82s -> 8947.46s]  Right to left.
[8948.18s -> 8948.90s]  Let's go, Mac.
[8949.62s -> 8950.58s]  Can I go into-
[8950.58s -> 8951.38s]  Can I go into Sninky's?
[8953.24s -> 8953.72s]  I can.
[8957.91s -> 8964.55s]  We use only the freshest ingredients in our pauper's own forbidden fruit of knowledge cider.
[8964.55s -> 8970.23s]  One sip, and for the first time, you know the difference between good and evil.
[8970.23s -> 8971.35s]  I don't know.
[8971.35s -> 8973.19s]  I've heard some bad things.
[8973.83s -> 8979.91s]  Ah, our competitors are just afraid that if you start selling this, you'll become too successful.
[8979.91s -> 8985.83s]  I don't need to tell you the advantages of an exclusive beverage distribution deal.
[8985.83s -> 8988.39s]  Seeing as how you're such a savvy businesswoman.
[8991.20s -> 8993.84s]  I'm making fucking mac and cheese and nobody can stop me.
[8994.80s -> 8997.59s]  What, weren't you making mac and cheese like an hour and a half ago?
[8998.39s -> 9003.57s]  How long have you been making it?
[9004.13s -> 9006.71s]  That seems like pretty long.
[9006.71s -> 9008.39s]  I think it's like takes 12 minutes.
[9011.38s -> 9012.50s]  Slow cooking it.
[9014.84s -> 9016.44s]  Don't overdo it.
[9016.44s -> 9017.32s]  Don't eat too much.
[9020.24s -> 9021.36s]  Wait, I said the thing.
[9025.44s -> 9025.92s]  Did I do-
[9025.92s -> 9029.78s]  Oh, whatever.
[9029.78s -> 9030.66s]  All right, fruit cider.
[9032.02s -> 9033.22s]  Hey, Stinky, how you doing?
[9033.22s -> 9034.50s]  What's up, Stinky?
[9034.50s -> 9035.46s]  Oh, good.
[9035.46s -> 9037.62s]  It's Virgil and Ulysses.
[9037.62s -> 9038.50s]  Actually, it's-
[9038.50s -> 9040.66s]  Maybe you two can give me some advice.
[9040.66s -> 9044.18s]  Mr. Whizzer's offer sounds very tempting.
[9044.18s -> 9046.90s]  Now, it all comes down to your per bottle cut.
[9046.90s -> 9049.86s]  Don't accept anything less than 10% for the first year
[9049.86s -> 9051.06s]  with quarterly renegotiations.
[9051.06s -> 9052.18s]  Yeah, I'll get a meme.
[9052.18s -> 9053.14s]  It's just mac and cheese.
[9053.14s -> 9053.94s]  Shut up, Max.
[9054.98s -> 9056.34s]  I'm still not sure.
[9057.78s -> 9058.50s]  Well, hold on.
[9060.26s -> 9061.86s]  Stinky's baby book.
[9061.86s -> 9063.46s]  I'm pretty sure she's already read it.
[9063.46s -> 9064.02s]  What about-
[9064.02s -> 9065.70s]  Do you want to read Stinky's baby book?
[9066.42s -> 9069.70s]  I don't think anyone wants to hear about Stinky's early years.
[9070.34s -> 9072.79s]  What about Grandpa?
[9075.44s -> 9076.56s]  Hey, Grandpa Stinky.
[9076.56s -> 9078.40s]  We found Stinky's baby book.
[9078.40s -> 9079.36s]  Good, good.
[9079.36s -> 9081.12s]  Quick, read page 33.
[9081.60s -> 9083.68s]  Well, I'm going to take this thing and put a cover on it.
[9083.68s -> 9085.52s]  Don't think I'm going to put it in here.
[9085.52s -> 9087.76s]  Out loud, you cretin.
[9087.76s -> 9088.72s]  Oh, let's see.
[9088.72s -> 9089.52s]  Bake, mumble, read.
[9089.52s -> 9092.56s]  Fish sticks, tar, coffee, ice cream.
[9092.56s -> 9094.88s]  What kind of baby book is this, anyway?
[9094.88s -> 9096.72s]  It's a cookbook.
[9096.72s -> 9098.24s]  The name of the recipe.
[9098.24s -> 9099.20s]  Read the name.
[9099.84s -> 9101.12s]  The Cake of the Damned.
[9102.72s -> 9103.22s]  What?
[9103.94s -> 9104.34s]  What?
[9104.34s -> 9104.74s]  What?
[9106.10s -> 9106.98s]  That'll teach her.
[9107.70s -> 9110.18s]  Well, maybe you, good sir,
[9110.26s -> 9112.66s]  would like to hear more about the delicious,
[9112.66s -> 9115.22s]  forbidden fruit of knowledge, cider.
[9115.22s -> 9116.26s]  Oh, no.
[9116.26s -> 9117.22s]  What have I done?
[9122.16s -> 9123.28s]  That has turned Stinky into a cake.
[9123.28s -> 9125.76s]  The last person I would have figured was secretly a cake.
[9125.76s -> 9127.04s]  She's been a cake this whole time?
[9130.21s -> 9130.85s]  Nothing doing.
[9139.11s -> 9140.07s]  What was the point of that?
[9140.07s -> 9140.87s]  Get lost, wizard.
[9140.87s -> 9142.39s]  Stinky ain't buying.
[9142.39s -> 9146.23s]  Stop interfering with my plans to bring hell on earth.
[9147.86s -> 9151.43s]  Well, what's going on here, Stinky?
[9151.43s -> 9152.15s]  Tell me what's going on.
[9152.23s -> 9155.35s]  My friends, stay a while and listen.
[9155.99s -> 9158.07s]  What turned you friendly so quickly?
[9158.07s -> 9159.83s]  I've made a terrible mistake.
[9159.83s -> 9161.27s]  You've got to help me get her back.
[9163.84s -> 9165.04s]  You old coot.
[9165.04s -> 9167.44s]  You tricked us into making girl Stinky disappear.
[9168.48s -> 9170.24s]  She didn't disappear.
[9170.24s -> 9172.00s]  She's still there.
[9172.00s -> 9176.56s]  When you read her true name, you revealed her true form.
[9176.56s -> 9177.84s]  Her true form?
[9177.84s -> 9179.60s]  Is she a demon or something?
[9179.60s -> 9181.04s]  In a sense, I suppose.
[9181.84s -> 9185.20s]  She's the most diabolical recipe ever created.
[9186.00s -> 9188.64s]  The cake of the damned.
[9191.97s -> 9193.33s]  Did we hear you right?
[9193.33s -> 9194.93s]  Girl Stinky is a cake?
[9194.93s -> 9196.45s]  Aye, to start.
[9196.45s -> 9198.77s]  I'd been experimenting with evil food for decades.
[9198.77s -> 9200.45s]  What the fuck is this?
[9200.45s -> 9201.89s]  You fiend!
[9201.89s -> 9203.97s]  It was for the good of mankind.
[9203.97s -> 9206.53s]  Humanity is weak and pathetic.
[9206.53s -> 9209.41s]  Always complaining about food poisoning
[9209.41s -> 9212.53s]  and severe gastrointestinal disorder.
[9212.53s -> 9216.37s]  But only the strongest could survive my dishes.
[9216.37s -> 9218.21s]  I'd create a master race.
[9218.93s -> 9220.61s]  And the most vile.
[9221.57s -> 9226.13s]  Combining an entree, sides, and dessert all into one bowl.
[9227.09s -> 9227.89s]  No, never.
[9228.45s -> 9231.17s]  The cake of the damned.
[9236.37s -> 9236.87s]  Okay.
[9238.79s -> 9240.15s]  Well, now what are we supposed to do?
[9240.15s -> 9243.19s]  Do your evil spell and get girl Stinky back to normal.
[9243.27s -> 9246.55s]  You've got to do what I did that fateful night.
[9246.55s -> 9249.35s]  The cake of the damned was only the first step.
[9249.35s -> 9254.71s]  I knew that to take the dish from just evil to purely diabolical,
[9254.71s -> 9256.71s]  it would need more.
[9256.71s -> 9258.63s]  An appetizer.
[9258.63s -> 9261.59s]  So I added spare ribs.
[9262.31s -> 9263.59s]  Plasphemy!
[9263.59s -> 9266.71s]  The next thing I knew, she appeared.
[9266.71s -> 9267.99s]  The rib is the key.
[9271.57s -> 9272.93s]  Service of an order of short ribs.
[9272.93s -> 9274.05s]  I'll take an order of ribs.
[9274.29s -> 9277.57s]  If I could find any, I would have already done it myself.
[9277.57s -> 9279.97s]  With this barbecue convention going on,
[9279.97s -> 9283.17s]  good luck finding anybody in the city with spare ribs.
[9284.56s -> 9287.76s]  All right, well, obviously we have to take a rib from somebody.
[9289.35s -> 9291.19s]  Whatever you do, Grandpa Stinky,
[9291.19s -> 9293.59s]  don't let Whizzer tempt you into making that deal.
[9293.59s -> 9294.79s]  Don't listen to them.
[9294.79s -> 9299.11s]  They're just jealous of your experience and wise life choices.
[9299.11s -> 9301.19s]  All right, well, he does have a point there.
[9301.19s -> 9303.19s]  You really think a guy dressed like that
[9303.27s -> 9305.03s]  knows about wise life choices?
[9306.40s -> 9307.60s]  You're right, of course.
[9308.32s -> 9308.64s]  Look at me.
[9308.64s -> 9309.44s]  I need a rib.
[9309.44s -> 9312.24s]  As weak and old fool as I've ever been.
[9312.24s -> 9315.92s]  The girl always was better at keeping her head about her,
[9315.92s -> 9317.36s]  much as I hate to admit it.
[9318.40s -> 9322.88s]  Okay, so we need a rib to get that back to normal.
[9324.39s -> 9327.67s]  We need to just shave it off at this point.
[9328.23s -> 9329.64s]  You know what I'm saying?
[9333.33s -> 9334.85s]  Stay strong, Stinky.
[9334.85s -> 9336.53s]  Don't leave me alone with him.
[9340.39s -> 9341.57s]  What was it?
[9341.57s -> 9342.77s]  Okay, I need to get in.
[9343.57s -> 9344.63s]  What do I need to get?
[9344.63s -> 9346.39s]  And a spare rib, a rib.
[9347.19s -> 9348.93s]  Let's talk to you.
[9348.93s -> 9350.13s]  Get lost, Whizzer.
[9350.13s -> 9351.57s]  Stinky ain't buying.
[9351.57s -> 9355.49s]  Stop interfering with my plans to bring hell unheard.
[9356.29s -> 9357.94s]  All right, so we know we need...
[9358.82s -> 9360.42s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9360.42s -> 9361.30s]  Just check everything.
[9362.18s -> 9365.09s]  The decor is ingenious.
[9365.09s -> 9366.77s]  No matter how many times I come in,
[9366.77s -> 9368.53s]  I just have to look at these things again.
[9369.41s -> 9371.52s]  No, this is bullshit.
[9371.52s -> 9375.67s]  All right, so I need a rib.
[9375.75s -> 9383.40s]  I need a game cartridge.
[9384.12s -> 9385.35s]  Two things that I need.
[9385.99s -> 9389.38s]  So let's keep going.
[9389.38s -> 9389.86s]  Right to left.
[9389.86s -> 9390.26s]  Satan.
[9390.82s -> 9395.19s]  Can we borrow some of your stuff, Satan?
[9395.19s -> 9397.59s]  Well, I suppose so.
[9397.59s -> 9399.83s]  I was hoping to sell it on eBay.
[9399.83s -> 9401.43s]  What if I received no bids?
[9401.43s -> 9403.27s]  Is the cross-country driving or something?
[9403.27s -> 9406.71s]  Father of Lies 666 might have something to do with that.
[9406.71s -> 9407.59s]  Let's see here.
[9408.47s -> 9409.03s]  What do you got?
[9410.48s -> 9412.64s]  One super long barbed paperclip chain.
[9413.20s -> 9429.22s]  And one grocery list written on company letterhead.
[9430.42s -> 9431.14s]  Am I taking all those?
[9431.14s -> 9432.58s]  I know you're the source of all evil,
[9432.58s -> 9435.46s]  but wasting office supplies for personal use?
[9435.46s -> 9436.74s]  That's just wrong.
[9437.86s -> 9441.20s]  Oh, God, I took it all.
[9441.20s -> 9443.68s]  Okay, so paperclip chain, grocery list,
[9444.32s -> 9445.12s]  and pork rinds.
[9445.12s -> 9445.92s]  Let's talk to Satan.
[9447.03s -> 9448.23s]  Hiya, Satan.
[9448.23s -> 9450.23s]  How's it hanging, old scratch?
[9450.23s -> 9453.99s]  The financial situation is quite dire, I'm afraid.
[9453.99s -> 9456.23s]  I did wash your windshield for you.
[9456.79s -> 9460.31s]  Oh, I must have left my change in my other suit.
[9460.87s -> 9461.19s]  Max?
[9462.47s -> 9463.11s]  I'm naked.
[9463.67s -> 9463.99s]  Yes.
[9464.79s -> 9465.51s]  Well.
[9465.51s -> 9465.83s]  What?
[9466.87s -> 9467.19s]  All right.
[9468.15s -> 9469.19s]  Hey, don't harp your nose.
[9469.19s -> 9471.83s]  Still angry at us for getting you fired and everything.
[9471.83s -> 9472.31s]  Angry?
[9472.87s -> 9474.71s]  You destroyed my entire life
[9474.71s -> 9477.75s]  and unleashed an unspeakable evil on the earth.
[9477.75s -> 9480.71s]  All out of carelessness and a desire for personal gain.
[9481.59s -> 9483.03s]  I invented that.
[9483.03s -> 9484.87s]  I couldn't be more proud.
[9488.71s -> 9489.75s]  I mean, it's true.
[9490.47s -> 9493.89s]  Now just to hunt for a new job going.
[9493.89s -> 9497.33s]  A few nibbles, but nothing promising.
[9497.33s -> 9500.13s]  I'm expecting a call from Rupert Murdoch next week.
[9501.01s -> 9502.42s]  All right, what about some advice?
[9502.42s -> 9504.50s]  Any suggestions on how to stop the poppers?
[9504.50s -> 9507.54s]  Oh, so we're stopping them now, are we?
[9507.54s -> 9511.38s]  I just assumed, since you spent so much time helping them.
[9511.38s -> 9512.42s]  Jeez, Satan.
[9512.42s -> 9514.10s]  We said we were sorry.
[9514.10s -> 9515.54s]  Or at least thought it real hard.
[9516.18s -> 9516.98s]  Oh, very well.
[9517.54s -> 9521.78s]  I began to lose power when people stopped taking me seriously.
[9521.78s -> 9524.42s]  Too many comical football mascots
[9524.42s -> 9527.30s]  and cartoon depictions on the devil family.
[9528.26s -> 9528.58s]  That's funny.
[9528.58s -> 9530.66s]  You can ruin their plans.
[9530.66s -> 9533.06s]  Make them appear ineffectual.
[9533.06s -> 9535.70s]  I'll be able to stage a corporate takeover.
[9536.90s -> 9537.46s]  Okay.
[9538.10s -> 9543.52s]  We never expected that getting you fired would leave you with nothing.
[9543.52s -> 9547.20s]  Yeah, after all these years, you should at least have a retirement fund.
[9547.20s -> 9552.56s]  No, my golden parachute has just this cardboard box of all my possessions.
[9552.56s -> 9553.60s]  Will condemn for food.
[9553.60s -> 9555.12s]  I feel somewhat foolish.
[9555.12s -> 9555.68s]  God bless.
[9555.68s -> 9558.48s]  Considering the billions of insurance salesmen
[9558.48s -> 9561.68s]  and investment bankers I've met over the centuries.
[9563.68s -> 9564.96s]  Okay, well, do you need anything?
[9564.96s -> 9566.40s]  Did you get you a blanket or something?
[9566.40s -> 9569.12s]  Might I trouble you to crash on your couch?
[9569.68s -> 9571.36s]  It's just me in the box.
[9572.08s -> 9575.52s]  Oh, we want to help you to help yourself.
[9578.53s -> 9580.53s]  The poppers are stealing all of your material.
[9580.53s -> 9583.97s]  Satan can't crash on my glory days at that.
[9583.97s -> 9586.53s]  If they're successful with this, I would do it.
[9586.53s -> 9588.61s]  They'll be unstoppable.
[9588.61s -> 9591.49s]  I feel like he'd owe you it just doesn't have the same rain.
[9593.96s -> 9599.08s]  You know, Satan own you a solid is that's kind of a big deal.
[9599.88s -> 9605.14s]  You're going for a new job.
[9605.14s -> 9607.38s]  I still have to update my resume.
[9607.38s -> 9608.82s]  It's been millennia.
[9608.82s -> 9611.14s]  Make sure you include detail oriented.
[9611.94s -> 9615.78s]  Okay.
[9615.78s -> 9618.26s]  The poppers are stealing all of your material.
[9618.26s -> 9621.30s]  Yes, and from my glory days at that.
[9621.30s -> 9626.18s]  If they're successful with making that's making a deal with say they'll be unstoppable.
[9626.18s -> 9628.82s]  Wizard made me do it just doesn't have the same rain.
[9629.38s -> 9631.62s]  No, the deal is hey buddy, you're crashing on my couch.
[9631.62s -> 9633.54s]  I'm going to hold that over your head forever.
[9633.54s -> 9634.18s]  That's not a deal.
[9635.89s -> 9640.29s]  That's you said can I sleep on your couch and I just said yes,
[9640.29s -> 9641.73s]  we didn't make a deal.
[9641.73s -> 9646.13s]  It wasn't yes, but no, no, no, it's just sure sleep on my couch.
[9646.13s -> 9647.01s]  Hope you enjoy yourself.
[9647.01s -> 9648.13s]  Do you need some water or something?
[9648.85s -> 9650.45s]  For the rest of your entire existence.
[9650.45s -> 9652.37s]  I'm going to hold this over your head and when I need something
[9654.77s -> 9656.21s]  you don't answer you look like a bad guy.
[9658.76s -> 9660.12s]  Stay strong, Satan.
[9660.12s -> 9661.08s]  You'll make it through this.
[9661.64s -> 9668.63s]  You're a survivor.
[9668.63s -> 9670.07s]  All right, we stop doing this.
[9670.87s -> 9672.71s]  That doesn't look hungry for pork rinds.
[9673.43s -> 9676.15s]  Stop it.
[9676.15s -> 9677.19s]  What are you doing this for?
[9678.07s -> 9680.15s]  The DeSoto seems different somehow.
[9681.04s -> 9682.56s]  I think I'll just walk for now.
[9685.14s -> 9685.70s]  He's Satan.
[9685.70s -> 9686.82s]  He already is a bad guy.
[9689.38s -> 9691.30s]  Nobody's the bad guy of their own story.
[9692.26s -> 9693.46s]  Everyone says he's the bad guy.
[9693.46s -> 9694.10s]  You know what I mean?
[9694.10s -> 9696.10s]  He thinks he's like the good guy somehow.
[9696.74s -> 9702.96s]  Somebody's blocking our office door from the inside.
[9703.92s -> 9706.18s]  How you feeling Timmy?
[9706.18s -> 9710.79s]  Oh, feel like ****.
[9710.79s -> 9712.15s]  That's a handsome Jack line.
[9725.49s -> 9726.93s]  Are you completely cured now?
[9727.25s -> 9729.17s]  The doctors say I'm all better.
[9729.17s -> 9731.41s]  But I've still got my ****ed up condition.
[9736.74s -> 9738.34s]  Hyped for Borderlands 3?
[9738.34s -> 9738.90s]  Not really.
[9739.70s -> 9740.90s]  What are you doing here?
[9740.90s -> 9745.70s]  Mr. Maintrom's looking after me until daddy gets back from his party.
[9745.70s -> 9748.02s]  We're playing song lyric trivia.
[9748.02s -> 9749.30s]  What the **** was that?
[9749.30s -> 9750.02s]  What the **** was it?
[9750.02s -> 9750.90s]  Get that out of here.
[9750.90s -> 9751.86s]  What the **** are you doing?
[9763.76s -> 9765.20s]  Glad to be back from hell.
[9765.20s -> 9766.16s]  Oh yeah.
[9766.16s -> 9771.04s]  I'm just disappointed the ****ed soda poppers never showed up at the hospital.
[9771.12s -> 9775.92s]  It was my dying wish to see them because I'm their biggest fan ever.
[9776.64s -> 9778.48s]  No Timmy, that's wrong.
[9778.48s -> 9779.60s]  Max is right.
[9779.60s -> 9782.00s]  The poppers are evil, wicked creatures.
[9782.00s -> 9784.32s]  And besides, I'm their biggest fan ever.
[9786.32s -> 9788.16s]  Ask me anything about them.
[9789.60s -> 9789.92s]  All right.
[9789.92s -> 9790.40s]  Let me pay.
[9791.73s -> 9792.61s]  Back to normal here.
[9794.07s -> 9795.27s]  What is Peeper's real name?
[9795.27s -> 9796.95s]  What's Peeper's real name?
[9798.56s -> 9800.96s]  Everybody knows his name is ****.
[9800.96s -> 9801.60s]  What was that?
[9802.00s -> 9805.12s]  I said his name is ****.
[9805.12s -> 9806.32s]  You lose again.
[9806.32s -> 9812.82s]  So we have to stop Hugh Bliss from censoring.
[9813.62s -> 9815.38s]  I'm on top of the game today, guys.
[9816.18s -> 9820.39s]  Stop Hugh Bliss from censoring so we get the name.
[9820.95s -> 9827.16s]  Are you old enough to write, Timmy?
[9827.16s -> 9828.84s]  Oh **** yeah.
[9828.84s -> 9833.72s]  I've been in the hospital so much that daddy's been homeschooling me.
[9833.72s -> 9840.92s]  So far, I've learned to write ampersands, asterisks, number signs, and exclamation points.
[9844.29s -> 9846.45s]  Max is the king of poppers trivia.
[9846.45s -> 9848.77s]  Do your **** worst.
[9848.77s -> 9851.89s]  Okay, so what's the name of the wizard's doctor?
[9851.89s -> 9855.57s]  In episode 205, the joy of specs.
[9855.57s -> 9858.21s]  What was the name of wizard's urologist?
[9858.21s -> 9859.57s]  Is that a trick question?
[9859.57s -> 9863.17s]  Because in that episode, wizard saw a gastroenterologist.
[9863.17s -> 9865.25s]  Dr. Thundercolon.
[9865.25s -> 9867.81s]  Sorry, Mr. Max, but I'm just too **** good.
[9871.12s -> 9872.80s]  Max is the king of poppers trivia.
[9872.80s -> 9874.00s]  Do your **** worst.
[9874.00s -> 9877.89s]  All right, so how old is specs?
[9877.89s -> 9879.17s]  How old is specs?
[9879.73s -> 9884.37s]  He's officially nine years old because he was born on a live day.
[9884.37s -> 9885.65s]  You lose again.
[9885.65s -> 9886.69s]  Nine years old, all right.
[9886.69s -> 9887.41s]  Hold on.
[9887.41s -> 9889.17s]  Max is the king of poppers trivia.
[9889.17s -> 9889.97s]  Do your **** worst.
[9889.97s -> 9891.57s]  Yeah, it really is, just the past week.
[9892.45s -> 9895.81s]  Okay, how many times has wizard been arrested?
[9895.81s -> 9897.97s]  Four times.
[9897.97s -> 9901.81s]  Gotcha, it's four times total.
[9901.81s -> 9907.00s]  But one was and another was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court.
[9907.72s -> 9910.92s]  Sorry, Mr. Max, but I'm just too **** good.
[9910.92s -> 9913.33s]  What are you doing here?
[9913.33s -> 9919.09s]  Mr. Maintromp's looking after me until he gets back to his party playing song lyric trivia.
[9919.09s -> 9922.45s]  Mr. Maintromp's almost as good as me.
[9922.45s -> 9923.33s]  The boy cheats.
[9924.13s -> 9929.19s]  Okay, so we got some info here that we're going to ****.
[9929.19s -> 9930.95s]  I'm piecing together this gigantic puzzle.
[9931.67s -> 9933.25s]  Let's talk to Maintromp.
[9934.85s -> 9939.81s]  No, idiots, I am engaged in a song trivia contest with this precocious rat child.
[9940.45s -> 9943.33s]  Guess it's better to say goodbye to you.
[9943.33s -> 9944.45s]  Goodbye to you.
[9950.53s -> 9953.33s]  Okay, I didn't go right to left.
[9953.33s -> 9954.69s]  I was supposed to go right to left.
[9964.50s -> 9969.62s]  Oh, baby, I'm going to be loving you all night long.
[9969.62s -> 9971.99s]  Did he swallow that microphone?
[9971.99s -> 9973.67s]  I think he swallowed the microphone.
[9973.67s -> 9975.91s]  Peepers is making the move on Sybil.
[9975.91s -> 9977.51s]  She's totally into it.
[9977.51s -> 9980.15s]  Just wanted to make sure my dementia hasn't kicked in early.
[9980.15s -> 9981.83s]  You can forget all about old Stoneface.
[9981.83s -> 9982.55s]  What the hell?
[9983.51s -> 9986.71s]  Peepers is the only man you need now.
[9988.74s -> 9990.42s]  Oh, Peepers.
[9992.20s -> 9994.84s]  He ate the karaoke machine or he swallowed the microphone of the
[9994.84s -> 9995.48s]  karaoke machine.
[9996.28s -> 10000.96s]  Lady, you're making me all tingly.
[10002.05s -> 10002.69s]  Hey, Peepers.
[10004.55s -> 10007.75s]  You may have Sybil fooled, but we can see what you truly are.
[10007.75s -> 10009.43s]  Evil will reign.
[10009.43s -> 10011.91s]  You must not disturb the vessel.
[10016.39s -> 10020.79s]  Fruit cider, bow and saw, paperclip chain, Satan's grocery list.
[10021.75s -> 10022.90s]  All right, one at a time.
[10022.90s -> 10023.86s]  Hold on, let's talk to Sybil.
[10023.86s -> 10025.06s]  Sybil, pay attention.
[10025.70s -> 10029.52s]  Sybil, Sybil, Sybil.
[10029.52s -> 10030.96s]  Snap out of it, Sybil.
[10030.96s -> 10033.36s]  It's, it's Peepers.
[10033.36s -> 10037.52s]  I know it is, but I've just never seen him this way before.
[10037.52s -> 10039.68s]  Oh, you're going to be seeing a lot more.
[10039.68s -> 10040.24s]  Over here.
[10040.24s -> 10040.88s]  Look over here.
[10043.51s -> 10043.91s]  Don't be a fool.
[10043.91s -> 10045.35s]  Show some dignity, Sybil.
[10045.35s -> 10047.35s]  But he's just dreamy.
[10048.07s -> 10051.91s]  It's like for the first time, I'm seeing him for who he really is.
[10052.95s -> 10053.91s]  I hate that.
[10054.47s -> 10056.87s]  I have hate, I hate that.
[10056.87s -> 10057.59s]  What the fuck?
[10058.23s -> 10060.48s]  What about your wedding?
[10060.48s -> 10062.00s]  Don't forget about Abe.
[10062.00s -> 10062.72s]  Abe who?
[10063.52s -> 10064.64s]  Oh, Lincoln.
[10064.64s -> 10065.28s]  Right.
[10065.28s -> 10066.80s]  I haven't forgotten.
[10066.80s -> 10069.20s]  I've just, I'm still single tonight.
[10069.20s -> 10070.00s]  All right?
[10070.00s -> 10070.50s]  Whoa.
[10072.13s -> 10073.65s]  What happened to the monster?
[10073.65s -> 10074.69s]  Oh, is he gone?
[10075.57s -> 10077.33s]  I wasn't paying attention.
[10077.33s -> 10079.97s]  Said something about Abe's bachelor party.
[10081.68s -> 10083.04s]  Abe's bachelor party?
[10083.84s -> 10086.48s]  Does it bother you that Abe's having a bachelor party?
[10086.48s -> 10090.56s]  No, we should all be free to have a little fun before we're married.
[10090.56s -> 10091.68s]  Oh, stop doing that.
[10091.68s -> 10093.44s]  I, I don't want to see that.
[10096.64s -> 10099.92s]  That face is just, again, it's blah.
[10100.72s -> 10103.32s]  Try to stay chaste, Sybil.
[10103.32s -> 10104.44s]  Mind your own business.
[10107.24s -> 10107.64s]  Okay.
[10107.64s -> 10110.68s]  Well, we obviously have to break up the bachelor party.
[10115.43s -> 10116.39s]  Cake at a wedding?
[10117.19s -> 10117.99s]  Oh, okay.
[10120.48s -> 10121.20s]  Hey, it's open.
[10122.40s -> 10122.88s]  It's open.
[10124.88s -> 10125.36s]  You're open.
[10152.15s -> 10155.03s]  Just had to, I like, I had that hurt me saying that.
[10155.03s -> 10156.87s]  So that's where the Esperanto bookstore is.
[10156.87s -> 10159.11s]  Okay, so we need to, we need...
[10161.43s -> 10161.83s]  Bosco's.
[10172.64s -> 10173.84s]  There's a lot going on here.
[10173.84s -> 10175.52s]  You're just in time for the stripper.
[10177.68s -> 10179.04s]  Wait, is Bosco the stripper?
[10188.31s -> 10189.83s]  Shake that moneymaker.
[10189.83s -> 10190.79s]  Take it off.
[10191.43s -> 10193.03s]  Take it all off.
[10204.40s -> 10206.48s]  I knew women were hard to find in our neighborhood,
[10206.48s -> 10208.48s]  but I didn't think it was this bad.
[10208.48s -> 10210.32s]  You people should be ashamed.
[10210.32s -> 10211.12s]  It's a living.
[10226.16s -> 10227.36s]  All right, what's in the cup?
[10228.00s -> 10229.68s]  Mr. Featherly.
[10229.68s -> 10231.84s]  Oh, a salmon, Max.
[10233.28s -> 10234.16s]  Is this a kid's game?
[10235.28s -> 10240.52s]  Better not have a cow in there.
[10240.52s -> 10243.56s]  Oh, I'll show you who's hiding a cow.
[10243.56s -> 10244.92s]  This chicken's drinking vodka.
[10244.92s -> 10246.76s]  Another celebrity meltdown.
[10247.40s -> 10247.96s]  Shut up.
[10248.92s -> 10250.92s]  You don't know my world.
[10251.72s -> 10256.98s]  What are you doing here?
[10256.98s -> 10258.26s]  You're not one of Lincoln's friends.
[10258.66s -> 10261.38s]  I'm taking bets on which one of these amateur drinkers
[10261.38s -> 10263.14s]  is going to pass out twice.
[10263.14s -> 10264.42s]  You ought to be ashamed, Jimmy.
[10264.42s -> 10265.14s]  That's just wrong.
[10265.14s -> 10266.26s]  50 bucks on the chicken.
[10267.54s -> 10268.04s]  What?
[10268.58s -> 10269.78s]  That's a pretty good investment.
[10269.78s -> 10271.54s]  You should see a pretty high rate of return.
[10272.34s -> 10274.90s]  Bosco, we freed you from your personal hell.
[10274.90s -> 10276.74s]  You don't have to be naked anymore.
[10276.74s -> 10278.58s]  Oh, that wasn't part of my health.
[10278.58s -> 10280.02s]  I just like to be naked.
[10280.02s -> 10282.42s]  And I'm not the only one who should be naked.
[10282.42s -> 10282.92s]  Woo!
[10285.00s -> 10286.12s]  That's right, baby.
[10292.69s -> 10294.05s]  Nah, I'd better keep it.
[10294.21s -> 10295.81s]  It should take all night to solve this case.
[10295.81s -> 10296.45s]  Sober him up.
[10300.40s -> 10303.44s]  Honest Abe, after all you and Sybil have been through,
[10303.44s -> 10304.96s]  you got a stripper?
[10304.96s -> 10308.56s]  Look, fellas, I'm marrying Sybil tomorrow.
[10308.56s -> 10312.88s]  Today, I got needs just like any other giant stonehead.
[10317.64s -> 10319.32s]  It's a color full of punch.
[10319.32s -> 10319.82s]  Punch.
[10320.44s -> 10322.08s]  What are we going to put?
[10322.08s -> 10324.80s]  Are we going to put fruit cider in the punch?
[10324.80s -> 10326.72s]  This ought to add some kick to their punch.
[10327.60s -> 10328.72s]  That's a snap right there.
[10335.11s -> 10337.11s]  Well, boys, another round?
[10337.11s -> 10338.23s]  Oh, dear.
[10338.23s -> 10339.91s]  Oh, man.
[10339.91s -> 10341.11s]  Oh, he passed out first.
[10341.99s -> 10342.79s]  I'm naked!
[10343.67s -> 10344.55s]  I'm naked!
[10345.11s -> 10346.47s]  I'm naked!
[10346.47s -> 10349.19s]  Oh, I thought we were all just saying that.
[10349.19s -> 10350.71s]  What have I done?
[10350.71s -> 10352.71s]  I'm so ashamed.
[10352.71s -> 10354.47s]  He's going to do the camera again.
[10354.47s -> 10358.07s]  I should have known hiring a budget stripper was a bad idea.
[10358.07s -> 10359.83s]  Cool your heels, flattop.
[10359.83s -> 10363.67s]  The show's over, but I was just getting started.
[10364.23s -> 10365.27s]  I knew it.
[10365.99s -> 10368.31s]  There is no use for me.
[10370.00s -> 10371.12s]  I broke it up.
[10371.12s -> 10372.64s]  Congoline, who's with me?
[10376.37s -> 10376.87s]  I am.
[10379.62s -> 10384.00s]  Okay, so now, get out of here.
[10384.64s -> 10386.80s]  Sybil's the only one for me.
[10387.44s -> 10389.44s]  Not monster strippers, no.
[10390.24s -> 10390.96s]  All right, coffee.
[10390.96s -> 10391.92s]  Let's go, coffee.
[10395.14s -> 10397.46s]  Is this the last we'll see of Bosco's paranoia?
[10398.10s -> 10403.25s]  I hope you've given up the degrading exotic dancing career.
[10403.25s -> 10408.21s]  Yes, I suppose now I just have to let this body go to waste.
[10408.21s -> 10410.53s]  That's kind of bad.
[10410.53s -> 10411.03s]  All right.
[10411.81s -> 10414.13s]  Have you finally come to your senses, Flint?
[10414.13s -> 10416.37s]  Somebody put a Mickey Finn in the happy juice, Sam,
[10416.37s -> 10419.89s]  and I'm going to find out who right after my head stops pounding.
[10423.32s -> 10424.12s]  Sober up.
[10424.12s -> 10425.00s]  Coffee in the cooler.
[10425.00s -> 10426.76s]  Coffee and punch don't mix.
[10427.80s -> 10435.03s]  Do you mind if we perform some quick elective surgery?
[10435.03s -> 10435.59s]  Can I get him?
[10435.59s -> 10436.55s]  Whatever.
[10436.55s -> 10437.43s]  He has ribs?
[10437.43s -> 10441.27s]  So with no soul, who cares about my feelings?
[10441.27s -> 10442.23s]  Great, thanks.
[10443.43s -> 10445.27s]  Wait, the monster has a rib.
[10445.27s -> 10447.91s]  A fool and his bones are soon target.
[10448.71s -> 10449.43s]  I got a rib.
[10450.55s -> 10451.67s]  Everybody has ribs.
[10451.67s -> 10454.71s]  He's made out of steel and like stitched together
[10456.07s -> 10458.47s]  clay and duct tape and fucking stone and stuff.
[10459.19s -> 10461.06s]  And we've got the rib.
[10461.78s -> 10467.80s]  They're all realizing they're naked.
[10467.80s -> 10468.30s]  Yeah.
[10469.16s -> 10470.04s]  Don't look at me.
[10470.76s -> 10473.64s]  I've never seen Frankenstein?
[10475.99s -> 10479.19s]  I've seen Frankenstein, but this is not Frankenstein.
[10479.91s -> 10482.82s]  Hold on.
[10482.82s -> 10484.50s]  Let me scroll over his name for a second here.
[10488.02s -> 10489.62s]  Frankenstein's monster.
[10489.62s -> 10490.34s]  That's not what it says.
[10491.06s -> 10495.35s]  Plus this steel here, metal, and we put stuff.
[10495.35s -> 10498.87s]  I put like chocolate and rocks and stuff in them.
[10498.87s -> 10499.83s]  I know what's inside of there.
[10507.19s -> 10507.69s]  Confirmed.
[10508.39s -> 10509.35s]  Denied.
[10509.35s -> 10516.12s]  What, does he have bones?
[10516.68s -> 10522.28s]  All right, so we got the rib.
[10524.79s -> 10525.59s]  Monster's rib.
[10526.55s -> 10528.31s]  Let's go do that first, I guess.
[10528.31s -> 10528.79s]  It's done.
[10529.59s -> 10532.77s]  It's gold, not chocolate.
[10539.60s -> 10543.64s]  Well, it was chocolate until we transmogrified it into gold.
[10547.16s -> 10547.66s]  Yep.
[10548.36s -> 10554.22s]  Happened.
[10554.92s -> 10557.08s]  Sam turned you back into a cake, but then we-
[10557.08s -> 10558.12s]  Whatever.
[10558.12s -> 10559.24s]  Look, Mr. Wizard.
[10559.24s -> 10563.72s]  Thanks for taking all this time to talk to us, but we're not interested.
[10563.72s -> 10564.68s]  But if you just-
[10564.68s -> 10567.80s]  The lady said we ain't interested.
[10567.80s -> 10569.48s]  Then maybe you-
[10569.48s -> 10572.60s]  I believe the two of us have made ourselves clear.
[10573.16s -> 10574.68s]  Ah, fine then.
[10574.68s -> 10576.36s]  That's too good for you just to-
[10576.36s -> 10577.24s]  One sin foiled.
[10577.24s -> 10579.00s]  And stay gone.
[10579.00s -> 10582.60s]  Looks like you two have learned an important lesson about cooperation.
[10583.16s -> 10583.88s]  Fine.
[10583.88s -> 10585.64s]  You going to order something?
[10585.64s -> 10588.20s]  You can't just offer something, woman.
[10588.20s -> 10590.28s]  You got to push the spacels.
[10590.28s -> 10593.72s]  I think I can do fine without your input, Grandpa.
[10593.72s -> 10595.00s]  Oh, you can, can't you?
[10596.77s -> 10597.25s]  Very good.
[10598.05s -> 10599.91s]  Well, let's just talk.
[10600.71s -> 10601.59s]  So stinky.
[10601.59s -> 10603.83s]  Why have you been lying to us all this time?
[10603.83s -> 10604.55s]  What?
[10604.55s -> 10606.55s]  I've never lied about anything.
[10606.55s -> 10610.07s]  Specs gave me the answers to that trivia contest.
[10610.07s -> 10613.27s]  Do you mean to tell me Herbert Hoover really was president?
[10613.91s -> 10617.11s]  Nah, we meant all that bunk about your history.
[10617.11s -> 10620.07s]  You never told us you were a golem made from cake and fish sticks.
[10620.07s -> 10620.55s]  I like that.
[10620.55s -> 10621.99s]  She doesn't know that.
[10621.99s -> 10623.75s]  And let's keep that to our secret.
[10625.35s -> 10630.64s]  That's like part one of the German 985 logo.
[10631.36s -> 10637.14s]  We just need some, like, magenta.
[10637.86s -> 10644.42s]  He hates one third of you.
[10646.77s -> 10650.12s]  Yeah, you're a logo.
[10650.12s -> 10651.80s]  I'm not a, I'm what?
[10653.72s -> 10654.84s]  Stay strong, stinky.
[10655.64s -> 10660.23s]  All right, we did that completed.
[10661.11s -> 10663.03s]  Now we've got to do the rest of this.
[10669.94s -> 10672.82s]  Get some red, some magenta, some teal, some cyan.
[10673.99s -> 10677.35s]  Recreate my whole logo from scratch.
[10677.35s -> 10678.47s]  All right, I need the game.
[10679.03s -> 10689.62s]  But first, I have, I know what I'm certain I have to do with this.
[10689.62s -> 10690.34s]  Let's go do this now.
[10691.14s -> 10692.26s]  So I know what I know to do.
[10692.26s -> 10692.82s]  I know what it is.
[10697.11s -> 10698.23s]  Redesign my logo.
[10699.56s -> 10702.05s]  No, that's my, that's my brand.
[10704.37s -> 10705.65s]  Yikes, don't touch that.
[10705.65s -> 10708.05s]  It's harder than a third rail at rush hour.
[10708.05s -> 10716.45s]  It's my brand.
[10733.86s -> 10736.26s]  Okay, we need to make him able to swear.
[10736.26s -> 10737.22s]  So we need to know his name.
[10738.10s -> 10741.38s]  Yeah, you can get t-shirts there.
[10746.56s -> 10747.60s]  Hear the band.
[10747.60s -> 10748.96s]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[10748.96s -> 10751.52s]  If this doesn't work, then I don't know why this wouldn't.
[10751.52s -> 10753.28s]  Max, distract Mr. Bliss for me.
[10753.28s -> 10754.08s]  Yep.
[10754.08s -> 10757.04s]  I seem to be completely naked.
[10757.04s -> 10758.64s]  Oh dear.
[10758.64s -> 10762.24s]  Hope I don't have to bend over provocatively to-
[10762.24s -> 10763.04s]  That's enough, Max.
[10764.40s -> 10766.00s]  Twenty dollars.
[10768.20s -> 10768.92s]  Twenty dollars, yeah.
[10769.64s -> 10770.44s]  Twenty dollars.
[10771.08s -> 10772.87s]  I got like probably one,
[10772.87s -> 10775.27s]  I got probably the cheapest shirt on Twitch.
[10775.27s -> 10778.55s]  Wait, hold on.
[10778.55s -> 10779.19s]  I'm reading the list.
[10789.09s -> 10790.37s]  It's Satan's grocery list.
[10791.41s -> 10796.36s]  Cantaloupe, melons, chicken breast, oregano, vanilla, and what?
[10796.36s -> 10797.32s]  It's Satan's grocery list.
[10797.32s -> 10797.82s]  And soda.
[10813.57s -> 10814.53s]  I got the-
[10814.53s -> 10817.25s]  Yeah, I got like one of the cheapest shirts on Twitch.
[10818.05s -> 10821.51s]  That shit's not like 32 bucks.
[10822.15s -> 10828.71s]  All right, anything else I can do here?
[10832.98s -> 10838.20s]  And, and, those shirts are made of high quality.
[10838.20s -> 10839.24s]  High quality material.
[10840.12s -> 10842.20s]  I could have picked like the Hanes t-shirt.
[10843.72s -> 10845.32s]  No, I picked the premium t-shirt.
[10845.88s -> 10848.02s]  Twenty dollars, premium t-shirt.
[10848.02s -> 10849.86s]  I want to make sure that you can get something good.
[10849.86s -> 10851.38s]  I don't want to charge too much for it.
[10852.02s -> 10855.09s]  Didn't select like the Hanes shirt.
[10855.09s -> 10857.73s]  Come on, I'm looking out for you.
[10857.73s -> 10859.89s]  Somebody, especially overseas.
[10860.61s -> 10864.21s]  You know, 20, 30, 40 dollars for like a shirt or something.
[10864.21s -> 10865.01s]  What are you talking about?
[10865.65s -> 10867.25s]  That's like 60 bucks.
[10867.25s -> 10868.13s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10868.13s -> 10868.77s]  I just want to make-
[10868.77s -> 10869.65s]  I'm looking out for you.
[10870.53s -> 10874.47s]  They are currently available.
[10875.19s -> 10890.34s]  Did I just build the wall and take the wall down in Minecraft?
[10890.98s -> 10894.28s]  What was I doing there?
[10894.84s -> 10901.51s]  I did what I was supposed to do, right?
[10901.51s -> 10902.39s]  What was I doing in there?
[10902.39s -> 10903.99s]  Okay, right, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[10908.98s -> 10909.78s]  Self-promotion.
[10911.49s -> 10914.13s]  Yeah, well, I mean, they're good shirts.
[10914.13s -> 10915.89s]  I'm going to tell you right now, they are.
[10917.44s -> 10919.04s]  Those of you that have purchased one of those shirts,
[10920.39s -> 10921.59s]  come on, speak up.
[10921.59s -> 10922.95s]  We need some testimonials here.
[10923.67s -> 10926.07s]  High quality material, beautiful artwork.
[10926.07s -> 10927.35s]  I'm an incredibly talented artist.
[10927.91s -> 10941.40s]  So now we can hear, uh, the name.
[10941.40s -> 10942.76s]  Max is the king of Popper's trivia.
[10946.05s -> 10948.21s]  What's Peeper's real name?
[10948.21s -> 10950.53s]  Easy, it's Dick Peacock.
[10951.83s -> 10952.63s]  Dick Peacock.
[10960.71s -> 10962.55s]  All right, so we got his real name.
[10963.27s -> 10965.12s]  So wait, can we get him to swear?
[10965.12s -> 10966.16s]  Where are you feeling, Timmy?
[10966.16s -> 10969.44s]  Better than I ever have in my whole darn life.
[10969.44s -> 10970.08s]  Shoot!
[10970.08s -> 10970.64s]  Nuts!
[10970.64s -> 10971.36s]  Fudge balls!
[10971.36s -> 10972.08s]  No, come on.
[10972.08s -> 10973.76s]  I've still got the Tourette's,
[10973.76s -> 10977.44s]  but that weird ringing in my ears has finally gone away.
[10979.68s -> 10981.60s]  Sorry we ruined your dad's fancy casino.
[10981.60s -> 10982.64s]  He wasn't actually swimming.
[10982.64s -> 10985.28s]  Ah, that place was a real doo-doo-ho anyway.
[10985.28s -> 10985.76s]  Doo-doo-ho.
[10985.76s -> 10990.24s]  I like having the robot alive because he flippin' loves trivia,
[10990.24s -> 10993.92s]  just like I do, and he's got a new reverent interface attitude.
[10993.92s -> 10995.12s]  Timmy's just, like, cute.
[10995.12s -> 10995.76s]  Just like Daddy.
[10995.76s -> 10996.88s]  You're my best friend.
[10996.88s -> 10998.56s]  He wasn't even being bad or mean.
[10998.56s -> 11003.44s]  Ah, there's nothing more heartwarming than the love of a rat for his abusive robot pal.
[11004.56s -> 11007.56s]  Okay, well, hold on, let me see.
[11007.56s -> 11009.64s]  Max is the king of Popper's trivia.
[11009.64s -> 11011.65s]  Bring it on!
[11011.65s -> 11017.11s]  Okay, so did we get any squares here?
[11017.11s -> 11018.15s]  In episode 205.
[11018.15s -> 11019.51s]  Is that a trick question?
[11019.51s -> 11020.95s]  Because in that episode, wizard-
[11020.95s -> 11021.27s]  No, okay.
[11021.27s -> 11022.55s]  Doctor Thunder-
[11022.55s -> 11023.11s]  Sorry!
[11023.11s -> 11023.99s]  All right, we got what we need.
[11024.79s -> 11025.75s]  See you later, Timmy.
[11030.80s -> 11032.48s]  Okay, so we have the real name.
[11033.75s -> 11035.11s]  We also need the game cartridge.
[11035.11s -> 11035.91s]  Let me see if I can get it.
[11040.02s -> 11042.26s]  Wait, how do I get the game cartridge if the train is there?
[11053.81s -> 11055.17s]  I can't do anything with the car.
[11055.17s -> 11058.04s]  The decoder seems different somehow.
[11058.04s -> 11059.64s]  I think I'll just walk for now.
[11060.36s -> 11061.32s]  I'm gonna look at my items.
[11062.98s -> 11066.10s]  The book, Bonesaw Paperclip Pork Rinds.
[11068.87s -> 11069.83s]  No, sorry.
[11069.83s -> 11071.99s]  I'm supposed to do the paperclip.
[11071.99s -> 11074.07s]  Is there anything changing here in the-
[11086.44s -> 11089.88s]  You just let people know how you want it, baby.
[11090.44s -> 11091.24s]  Say my name.
[11091.88s -> 11092.76s]  Say my name.
[11093.48s -> 11094.60s]  Hey, Dick Peacock.
[11098.02s -> 11098.82s]  What?
[11098.82s -> 11103.11s]  You- What have you done to his eyes?
[11104.15s -> 11105.99s]  You still want to make out?
[11105.99s -> 11106.95s]  Oh, hell no.
[11111.14s -> 11113.94s]  Well, we've saved Sibyl from a lifetime of regret.
[11113.94s -> 11116.18s]  And given ourselves a blackmail opportunity
[11116.18s -> 11118.02s]  to secure our financial future.
[11118.02s -> 11120.26s]  Richard Peacock is a pretty cool name.
[11121.30s -> 11131.19s]  All right, so we got that taken care of.
[11131.19s -> 11132.87s]  Is the wedding back on track?
[11132.87s -> 11135.03s]  Yes, but now I'm behind schedule.
[11135.99s -> 11140.23s]  Um, let's not mention any of that peepers incident around Abe, okay?
[11140.23s -> 11141.83s]  We'll try not to.
[11142.47s -> 11144.79s]  You know, a donation to my re-election fund
[11144.79s -> 11147.35s]  would make it easier for me to keep my mouth shut.
[11149.14s -> 11150.50s]  Okay, so we have two things taken care of.
[11150.50s -> 11152.98s]  Now I only have one more to do, which is the game.
[11154.02s -> 11159.99s]  No, that's- but it's Dick Peacock.
[11160.87s -> 11163.94s]  You're forgetting the first three letters of the last name.
[11164.50s -> 11168.16s]  I would have- I would open up my own, like,
[11168.16s -> 11169.60s]  private eye investigation firm.
[11170.24s -> 11186.42s]  Okay, now I need a game cartridge.
[11187.06s -> 11188.93s]  Let me see.
[11189.65s -> 11191.09s]  Can I get a game cartridge here?
[11191.81s -> 11199.52s]  This has to move.
[11200.16s -> 11202.80s]  But if I get inside of it, can I get a game cartridge?
[11207.12s -> 11209.12s]  I didn't think the game was that bad.
[11209.12s -> 11212.16s]  Games based on a license are never a good business decision.
[11215.43s -> 11216.79s]  There's one just sitting right here.
[11220.05s -> 11222.93s]  I mean, look, that's- the text is facing the screen.
[11223.73s -> 11224.69s]  All right, hold on a second.
[11225.41s -> 11227.75s]  That's right up here where the steam is.
[11228.39s -> 11246.76s]  Is this gonna be too hot?
[11254.05s -> 11256.37s]  So that's where the Esperanto bookstore went.
[11256.37s -> 11256.87s]  Yeah.
[11276.72s -> 11278.40s]  I win, I win, I win, I win, I win.
[11285.04s -> 11287.84s]  Console, here's a new song for you.
[11287.84s -> 11289.36s]  And then they- all of them fail.
[11290.00s -> 11291.52s]  And Satan gets to come back.
[11292.56s -> 11293.20s]  Here we go.
[11306.34s -> 11307.76s]  Let's see who has a better song.
[11315.11s -> 11323.40s]  That is nice.
[11347.30s -> 11347.80s]  Melted.
[11348.34s -> 11350.74s]  Start it into a giant bar and make like a hundred grand.
[11370.90s -> 11376.26s]  Here comes the finale.
[11377.06s -> 11379.24s]  You've lost, poppers.
[11379.72s -> 11385.16s]  It's time we put an end to this charade and return to hell to its rightful owner.
[11385.16s -> 11386.76s]  What Satan said?
[11386.76s -> 11389.16s]  Poppers assume demon form.
[11391.11s -> 11394.52s]  Behold, papers the omniscient sea of-
[11394.52s -> 11395.32s]  Guy fairy.
[11396.20s -> 11396.92s]  Ah, that's killing.
[11398.12s -> 11398.92s]  Oh, that was spicy.
[11404.79s -> 11408.00s]  You got cayenne in there, man.
[11410.05s -> 11410.69s]  Out of the park.
[11411.76s -> 11414.32s]  Behold, specs the dominator of-
[11414.96s -> 11416.40s]  Oh, come on.
[11416.40s -> 11418.08s]  Those are your demon forms?
[11418.64s -> 11419.94s]  They're different colors.
[11420.66s -> 11424.82s]  Why am I always the only one who puts any effort into these things?
[11424.82s -> 11427.14s]  This is fucking a little twisted.
[11427.14s -> 11428.34s]  I'm not enjoying this, poppers, anymore.
[11428.34s -> 11429.30s]  Can I kill them?
[11429.30s -> 11430.98s]  Not if I get them first.
[11430.98s -> 11432.90s]  Banish the irritants!
[11432.90s -> 11436.18s]  Sam and Max, we cast you into the pit.
[11436.82s -> 11444.58s]  Wive up the book.
[11444.58s -> 11447.94s]  The bell.
[11447.94s -> 11449.72s]  The candle.
[11450.44s -> 11455.88s]  Oh, no.
[11455.88s -> 11458.28s]  So be it.
[11458.28s -> 11459.48s]  Now we gotta get out of the hole.
[11460.52s -> 11472.08s]  Well, Max, unless we learn how to fly, we're destined to spend the remainder of our days
[11472.08s -> 11476.40s]  on a tiny outcropping surrounded by impossibly hot lava, ash, and soot.
[11476.40s -> 11479.36s]  I don't mind, Sam, as long as I'm with my best friend.
[11479.92s -> 11481.36s]  Oh, that's sweet.
[11481.36s -> 11485.04s]  So how do we go from here?
[11485.04s -> 11485.84s]  Sorry, buddy.
[11485.84s -> 11486.80s]  I already ate them all.
[11494.29s -> 11495.81s]  Goiters of Rube Goldberg.
[11495.81s -> 11497.57s]  Look, Max, it's Santa's sleigh.
[11497.57s -> 11498.13s]  That's funny.
[11498.13s -> 11500.13s]  What an unexpected stroke of luck.
[11500.13s -> 11501.57s]  Or is it, Max?
[11501.57s -> 11505.57s]  Remember that time long ago when we jacked Santa's sleigh and had to save Christmas
[11505.57s -> 11508.29s]  and drove it recklessly into a hellish vision of the future,
[11508.29s -> 11510.53s]  very much like the one we're standing in now?
[11510.53s -> 11513.33s]  I stopped paying attention halfway through that sentence.
[11513.33s -> 11516.21s]  I wonder if our ghosts are here guiding us right now.
[11516.21s -> 11517.89s]  Pay past me!
[11517.89s -> 11518.77s]  Check this out!
[11519.81s -> 11523.00s]  Classy as always, little pal.
[11523.00s -> 11524.12s]  Now let's get out of here.
[11524.92s -> 11525.64s]  Fork rinds.
[11534.76s -> 11536.04s]  This is expert handling.
[11536.04s -> 11536.92s]  You enter here.
[11537.80s -> 11541.19s]  We escaped?
[11541.19s -> 11543.40s]  That's highly possible.
[11543.40s -> 11548.37s]  This baby out in flight donuts around the seventh circle.
[11548.37s -> 11549.97s]  It's out of power, little buddy.
[11549.97s -> 11551.89s]  Guess I shouldn't have left the afterburners on.
[11553.65s -> 11559.51s]  Commissioner?
[11560.15s -> 11560.95s]  No, Sam's here.
[11560.95s -> 11561.99s]  Commissioner?
[11561.99s -> 11562.47s]  I don't know.
[11562.47s -> 11563.67s]  He just let me answer it.
[11564.79s -> 11566.47s]  Is it cold in here to you, Max?
[11566.47s -> 11567.91s]  I should have worn my muck locks.
[11569.27s -> 11573.73s]  What the hell?
[11574.37s -> 11575.81s]  What's that, Commissioner?
[11575.81s -> 11578.13s]  I won the Nobel Peace Prize?
[11578.13s -> 11579.25s]  Congrats, pal.
[11579.25s -> 11581.25s]  I can't think of anyone who deserves it more.
[11581.25s -> 11582.13s]  Is it Sam in there?
[11583.57s -> 11584.93s]  Okay, thanks, Commissioner.
[11585.57s -> 11587.73s]  Okay. Roger that.
[11587.73s -> 11588.45s]  Love you, too.
[11589.73s -> 11591.25s]  Do we have a new case, little buddy?
[11591.25s -> 11592.45s]  Nah, same one.
[11592.45s -> 11595.09s]  But Sybil wants me to officiate at her wedding.
[11595.09s -> 11596.45s]  Well, that'll be fun.
[11596.45s -> 11599.81s]  We'd better hurry up and restore the balance of power in hell, then.
[11599.81s -> 11601.41s]  A little help here, guys.
[11602.85s -> 11603.17s]  Eggs!
[11604.37s -> 11605.83s]  I have eggs!
[11606.39s -> 11619.88s]  Time to pay, poppers.
[11623.43s -> 11625.27s]  One second, thought. Perhaps I'll wait here.
[11628.04s -> 11629.16s]  Is this just a snowball fight?
[11631.08s -> 11631.40s]  All right.
[11631.40s -> 11632.52s]  Ice ball right in the face.
[11636.48s -> 11636.72s]  Fuck it.
[11636.72s -> 11637.44s]  Let's get Satan.
[11641.40s -> 11642.28s]  Sing fast, wizard.
[11647.64s -> 11648.76s]  Rock in the snow.
[11648.76s -> 11649.00s]  All right.
[11649.00s -> 11649.40s]  We got it.
[11649.40s -> 11650.12s]  Hold on.
[11650.12s -> 11653.49s]  What else?
[11653.49s -> 11653.89s]  What's over here?
[11653.89s -> 11654.85s]  We got a candle.
[11656.23s -> 11658.55s]  People really shouldn't leave ritual candles lying around.
[11659.64s -> 11660.44s]  Candle.
[11660.44s -> 11661.48s]  We got coffee.
[11663.68s -> 11664.32s]  What else do I got?
[11666.00s -> 11666.40s]  Candle.
[11667.92s -> 11668.88s]  What about the ice cream truck?
[11673.70s -> 11674.66s]  No, stop doing that.
[11677.78s -> 11678.34s]  It's locked.
[11688.05s -> 11690.21s]  You can't shoot the rulers of hell.
[11691.88s -> 11692.68s]  Say the line.
[11692.68s -> 11693.88s]  No, I'm not saying the line.
[11694.77s -> 11696.69s]  Okay, so what about, um...
[11696.69s -> 11698.48s]  What about SCP?
[11698.48s -> 11699.04s]  How you doing?
[11699.04s -> 11699.92s]  Hey, SCP.
[11699.92s -> 11700.88s]  Whatcha readin'?
[11700.88s -> 11702.16s]  Norbard!
[11702.16s -> 11703.52s]  What came over him?
[11703.52s -> 11705.60s]  He's actually being productive.
[11705.60s -> 11707.60s]  We live in a world of times, Max.
[11708.40s -> 11712.16s]  Santa's sleigh doesn't work.
[11712.16s -> 11713.36s]  It's out of fuel.
[11713.36s -> 11714.96s]  Why couldn't Stinky have lied more?
[11715.52s -> 11717.48s]  Okay, so I got the candle.
[11717.48s -> 11718.20s]  What about the coffee?
[11722.20s -> 11723.24s]  Ice cream bell?
[11723.88s -> 11725.75s]  Can we shoot the bell?
[11725.75s -> 11727.59s]  Maybe they'll go over to the ice cream?
[11738.21s -> 11739.73s]  Oh, the bell of the...
[11739.73s -> 11740.69s]  Okay, hold on.
[11741.96s -> 11743.00s]  The bell of the book.
[11747.09s -> 11747.59s]  And...
[11748.85s -> 11751.33s]  I don't like that we can see him digesting, Sam.
[11751.33s -> 11753.97s]  It's all part of nature's hideous circle of life, Max.
[11753.97s -> 11754.47s]  Candle.
[11755.33s -> 11756.95s]  So then what can I...
[11756.95s -> 11757.99s]  Put the candle on there.
[11759.52s -> 11760.08s]  Here you go!
[11765.86s -> 11766.36s]  Bye!
[11769.35s -> 11771.83s]  Time out for number three.
[11772.79s -> 11773.29s]  No!
[11774.32s -> 11774.82s]  Yes!
[11777.52s -> 11778.02s]  What?
[11791.70s -> 11792.20s]  Ice cream.
[11796.82s -> 11797.78s]  Plain vanilla.
[11798.42s -> 11799.54s]  Okay, so I got ice cream.
[11800.93s -> 11801.49s]  Snowball.
[11802.37s -> 11804.74s]  He's gotta blow out the candle.
[11805.38s -> 11808.08s]  Looks like a plain shit.
[11809.59s -> 11810.15s]  Vanilla.
[11811.04s -> 11811.92s]  Vanilla ice cream.
[11818.05s -> 11818.55s]  Do you eat it?
[11819.41s -> 11819.97s]  Do you want this?
[11820.45s -> 11820.95s]  Poppers.
[11822.48s -> 11824.48s]  I gotta get him to like, get out of here.
[11824.48s -> 11825.44s]  You fucked it all up.
[11826.00s -> 11835.78s]  All right, there it is.
[11843.01s -> 11844.45s]  What about SAP's desk?
[11846.85s -> 11847.49s]  No.
[11847.49s -> 11850.44s]  Anything over here?
[11853.52s -> 11854.24s]  Water cooler.
[11854.88s -> 11855.52s]  Microwave.
[11855.52s -> 11857.76s]  Good thing Mr. Specialist's fish tank is open,
[11857.76s -> 11860.48s]  so he can enjoy the winter wonderland with the rest of us.
[11861.67s -> 11862.31s]  Microwave.
[11862.95s -> 11864.39s]  It has three settings.
[11864.39s -> 11866.47s]  Bake, popcorn, and cremate.
[11867.43s -> 11868.39s]  Can I put anything in here?
[11869.35s -> 11871.91s]  Can I put ice cream in the microwave?
[11873.11s -> 11878.00s]  Can I put...
[11881.11s -> 11881.83s]  Why would I do this?
[11883.35s -> 11884.71s]  Why would I want to do this to you?
[11887.75s -> 11888.25s]  Coke?
[11890.55s -> 11891.43s]  What did I just do?
[11896.77s -> 11897.49s]  All right, hold on.
[11897.49s -> 11898.93s]  I'm making the cake.
[11898.93s -> 11899.57s]  And coffee!
[11907.09s -> 11916.05s]  Blow out the candle!
[11917.49s -> 11920.13s]  No, put the candle in the cake!
[11920.13s -> 11921.17s]  Put the candle in the cake.
[11922.05s -> 11923.32s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11923.32s -> 11924.44s]  Candle in the cake and it's done.
[11925.16s -> 11929.17s]  They baited me with the snowball.
[11937.17s -> 11937.49s]  Got it.
[11948.47s -> 11949.59s]  And then he gets happy.
[11957.59s -> 11958.23s]  Birthday.
[11962.82s -> 11963.70s]  I'm gonna drop them all.
[11976.32s -> 11976.80s]  Kill them.
[11978.31s -> 11979.75s]  I don't think we'll be seeing them again.
[11979.75s -> 11981.51s]  Don't ever say that again, Max.
[11981.51s -> 11982.63s]  Not even as a joke.
[11984.05s -> 11988.61s]  Well, boys, you've restored the infernal realms to their former glory.
[11988.61s -> 11991.49s]  Thanks to your quick thinking and irrepressible spirit,
[11991.49s -> 11992.45s]  hell is safe.
[11993.17s -> 11994.37s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[11994.37s -> 11996.85s]  I'm extremely proud of myself right now.
[11996.85s -> 11997.97s]  We better run, Max.
[11997.97s -> 12000.29s]  Sybil and Abe's wedding will be starting any minute.
[12000.29s -> 12001.65s]  Oh, you gotta appreciate the wedding.
[12001.65s -> 12002.13s]  Let's go.
[12002.13s -> 12003.33s]  Sam's paying me by the hour.
[12003.33s -> 12004.21s]  Does Satan go to the wedding?
[12004.21s -> 12005.73s]  Don't lie to the reception, Satan.
[12005.73s -> 12006.21s]  Really?
[12006.77s -> 12009.25s]  I don't want you to get tired of me so soon
[12009.81s -> 12012.69s]  since you're going to be seeing so much of me later.
[12013.73s -> 12015.65s]  I didn't like the sound of that.
[12015.65s -> 12016.85s]  Don't sweat it, Sam.
[12016.85s -> 12020.13s]  We're bound to get reincarnated as each other a few times anyway.
[12020.13s -> 12021.89s]  You crack me up, little blasphemer.
[12024.26s -> 12025.14s]  We're going to see the wedding?
[12026.84s -> 12028.84s]  Love is in the air, everybody.
[12028.84s -> 12031.56s]  So hold on tight while we get on board.
[12031.56s -> 12033.44s]  Wedding train.
[12037.62s -> 12039.22s]  Season two, Sam and Max.
[12039.78s -> 12041.52s]  There it is.
[12041.52s -> 12044.74s]  Why are you with the bride or groom, sir?
[12046.18s -> 12047.94s]  What if I don't like either one?
[12050.40s -> 12051.84s]  Daring credit scene.
[12051.84s -> 12052.88s]  I'm gonna be quiet for this.
[12054.24s -> 12055.60s]  Oh, hey.
[12055.60s -> 12056.96s]  You're wearing white.
[12056.96s -> 12058.32s]  Interesting choice.
[12058.32s -> 12060.88s]  Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
[12060.88s -> 12063.92s]  to celebrate this twisted mockery of holy matrimony.
[12065.04s -> 12066.48s]  It's so beautiful.
[12066.48s -> 12068.56s]  I hope they have lots of children.
[12068.56s -> 12069.12s]  He came.
[12069.12s -> 12069.60s]  He's out.
[12069.60s -> 12070.56s]  I wouldn't say that.
[12071.52s -> 12072.56s]  Do you have the ring?
[12073.44s -> 12074.64s]  Oh, shoot.
[12075.60s -> 12079.12s]  I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
[12079.12s -> 12081.20s]  Hunter box says they don't last three months.
[12087.99s -> 12093.75s]  Ready, girl?
[12094.63s -> 12095.52s]  Anytime.
[12099.76s -> 12100.26s]  Fail.
[12106.13s -> 12108.13s]  And what is it that you do?
[12108.13s -> 12111.17s]  Listen up, because I'm only going to say this twice.
[12111.17s -> 12112.45s]  I'm a bug.
[12112.45s -> 12113.25s]  A bug.
[12113.89s -> 12114.69s]  Interesting.
[12115.41s -> 12119.25s]  May I interest you in a new blackmail opportunity?
[12120.29s -> 12125.38s]  Oh, the zombies.
[12126.66s -> 12129.00s]  That's so sweet.
[12129.00s -> 12129.88s]  Thanks for coming.
[12133.96s -> 12135.64s]  Thank you so much.
[12135.64s -> 12136.60s]  Enjoy the dinner.
[12142.96s -> 12145.20s]  Are we having the wedding?
[12146.00s -> 12148.36s]  We're not in the White House.
[12149.08s -> 12152.92s]  It is kind of-
[12152.92s -> 12154.52s]  You put your left foot in.
[12154.52s -> 12156.04s]  You put your left foot out.
[12157.00s -> 12158.76s]  Play love, Shaq, baby.
[12159.40s -> 12160.52s]  It tricks the egg.
[12164.39s -> 12165.27s]  Bye, kids.
[12165.27s -> 12165.83s]  Have fun.
[12166.39s -> 12168.15s]  Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
[12168.71s -> 12171.27s]  You think we can trust them with our car, Sam?
[12171.27s -> 12173.11s]  It's possessed by demons, Max.
[12173.83s -> 12176.71s]  Can we trust the car with them?
[12179.60s -> 12180.10s]  The end.
[12182.13s -> 12184.85s]  Hey, and that's the end of season two.
[12184.85s -> 12185.81s]  But it's a question mark.
[12185.81s -> 12187.01s]  That means, hold on.
[12187.65s -> 12188.53s]  Could be another one.
[12190.92s -> 12193.08s]  The poppers are going to be come back.
[12194.04s -> 12199.25s]  You haven't seen the last of us, Sam and Max.
[12199.25s -> 12201.81s]  We can never be defeated.
[12201.81s -> 12202.77s]  We'll be back.
[12203.49s -> 12204.69s]  We'll be back.
[12217.03s -> 12217.83s]  Oh, shit.
[12218.55s -> 12219.51s]  They aren't going to be back.
[12219.51s -> 12220.95s]  They won't be back, actually.
[12223.38s -> 12225.54s]  They just got torched alive.
[12231.81s -> 12233.17s]  That's fucking funny.
[12233.17s -> 12234.93s]  Well, I don't think we will see them again.
[12235.73s -> 12237.49s]  Well, there you go.
[12237.49s -> 12238.13s]  That's season two.
[12238.69s -> 12240.37s]  We've gone through season one and season two.
[12244.36s -> 12249.64s]  So it is time to put Sam and Max away.
[12249.64s -> 12250.84s]  I know Jerma lied about it.
[12250.84s -> 12251.88s]  We're going to do season three right after,
[12251.88s -> 12253.80s]  but there was extenuating circumstances
[12254.68s -> 12257.24s]  because I have a campaign in Heroes of Might and Magic
[12257.24s -> 12258.84s]  that is still not complete.
[12260.45s -> 12262.21s]  That I did say I was going to finish too.
[12262.21s -> 12266.44s]  And so I figured today, first day back from colonoscopy,
[12266.44s -> 12269.88s]  let's just get some of these things that are not finished finished.
[12272.07s -> 12273.75s]  And season three will come back.
[12273.75s -> 12275.75s]  We'll do season three.
[12276.63s -> 12281.57s]  I have some plans for streams of the next week or so,
[12281.57s -> 12282.13s]  week and a half.
[12283.24s -> 12285.24s]  But as of like a week or two from now,
[12285.24s -> 12286.84s]  we'll go we'll go back to season three.
[12287.48s -> 12290.79s]  So don't worry, we will.
[12290.79s -> 12293.35s]  I promise that we will do all of these.
[12293.99s -> 12295.80s]  But like I said before,
[12295.80s -> 12297.72s]  I don't want Sam and Max exhaustion
[12298.44s -> 12299.24s]  because that could happen.
[12299.88s -> 12303.60s]  You know, but it's fun and interesting
[12303.60s -> 12306.48s]  and kind of comfy as these streams are.
[12307.83s -> 12309.11s]  I'd rather spread it out a little.
[12309.75s -> 12311.14s]  You know what I'm saying?
[12312.04s -> 12316.44s]  So we are going to move on to the campaign
[12318.55s -> 12321.40s]  that I left a few nights ago.
[12322.20s -> 12323.24s]  I'm probably going to lose it,
[12323.24s -> 12324.92s]  but that's what we're going to do for the remainder of the stream.
[12325.88s -> 12327.16s]  If you do not want to see that,
[12327.16s -> 12329.80s]  if that's not something that interests you tomorrow,
[12330.76s -> 12332.28s]  we are going to do cooking simulator.
[12333.49s -> 12335.64s]  So I'm looking forward to that.
[12335.64s -> 12336.36s]  Should be a lot of fun.
[12337.16s -> 12339.04s]  I've been waiting for it for a long time.
[12340.76s -> 12342.12s]  Probably going to lose in this campaign,
[12342.12s -> 12343.32s]  but I do want to see the end of it.
[12344.04s -> 12344.68s]  At least try.
[12346.13s -> 12347.73s]  But I'll be right back.
[12347.73s -> 12350.77s]  I'll take this opportunity to be right back.
[12352.66s -> 12354.66s]  Grab a snack, go to the bathroom if you need to.
[12355.54s -> 12358.66s]  Heroes of Might and Magic 3 will be what you see when I return.
[12360.20s -> 12361.00s]  See you soon.
