[4.66s -> 13.77s]  Okay, I'm back. So, Vampire Survivors. This is not the first time I've played this game.
[15.64s -> 23.32s]  Holly and I used to, when it first came out, really just grind this. I've played a lot of this so far,
[24.50s -> 32.81s]  but it was really when it first came out, so I have not played it in like six or seven updates.
[38.79s -> 49.27s]  I did play a lot of it though, so I'm very seasoned. If you don't know what this game
[49.27s -> 56.39s]  is, then you're in for a treat, because the game is actually incredible. Okay, let's get it open.
[64.60s -> 77.11s]  I might be a little rusty. It has been a while. We'll find out. No wobble dogs? No, I won't play
[77.11s -> 88.70s]  this. So, I don't know how to get like the new... There's a bunch of new characters, I think. I do
[88.70s -> 102.17s]  need to turn it up though. That is far too low. How's that? Better? Okay, can you see? I don't
[102.17s -> 116.57s]  think you can see yet. Hold on. You can't even see me. No. This is creepy. Okay, let's get it up here.
[116.57s -> 150.34s]  Fucking glover. Can you see it? No? I've never captured this game before. Do I have to capture
[150.34s -> 160.70s]  the... I probably have to capture the window. That would make sense, wouldn't it? Oh, let me get it.
[160.70s -> 179.69s]  Hold on. Okay, there it is. I should be able to see it now. Okay, that's not correct. That is also
[179.69s -> 190.28s]  not correct. That is not correct either. Hey, look at that. Okay, I got a lot of money, as you see.
[190.28s -> 195.62s]  I got a lot of cash. I play with a controller. Does that make me a shitty person? Does that make
[195.62s -> 209.27s]  me bad? How come it's not... There we go. Okay. Yeah? Does it make me bad at the game? I know,
[209.27s -> 212.47s]  you just move around. You literally just walk around. All right, so let's get started. So, start.
[212.47s -> 218.87s]  You want to see what I've done. I've gotten to level 20 in the forest. This, all this shit. Yeah,
[218.87s -> 228.39s]  I don't even know what this is. A hundred? I've survived 10 minutes. All right, let's just go.
[228.39s -> 234.38s]  Want to see my collection? So, they added a lot of stuff, huh? There's like a whole row of new
[234.38s -> 244.23s]  items. I'm interested. So, who should I play with? I like this guy with the bones. You get more... Oh,
[244.23s -> 250.82s]  wait, wait, wait. I need to do my unlocks. Oh, power-ups, yeah. So, did they add any new power-ups?
[254.38s -> 262.76s]  Revive once with 50% health? That seems kind of insane. Curse. Increases enemy speed, health,
[262.76s -> 272.81s]  quantity, and frequency by 10% per rank. Why would you want to do this? That feels kind of like...
[272.81s -> 280.06s]  Just make the game harder? It's a challenge run. Oh, okay. I'm going to try this. I'll take this one.
[281.37s -> 285.53s]  And then I usually take the damage one. I love the damage one. And by the way, the money I got,
[285.53s -> 291.67s]  because as you play the game, you just get money and you can spend it however you want. You can
[291.67s -> 296.97s]  refund it whenever you want as well. I know I'm making a lot of motions and gestures towards you.
[296.97s -> 304.20s]  You can refund it whenever you want. All right, so this is damage. 5% damage per rank. I'm just
[304.20s -> 315.18s]  going to do this max. What else did I like used to do? Pull down. Oh, more projectiles. Hell yeah.
[316.30s -> 329.46s]  Move speed. Hell yeah. Luck. Hell yeah. More coins? Yeah. What else is good? I forget. I haven't
[329.46s -> 337.54s]  played in like three or four months. Probably area. All right. Attack speed. Oh, that's right.
[337.54s -> 347.08s]  I don't really care about the magnet thing, although it's very helpful. Read. Max health.
[349.94s -> 355.94s]  Duration. Yeah, whatever. I mean, it's been a while, but I'm just going to fucking put points
[355.94s -> 360.17s]  away. It doesn't matter. All right, let's go. I'm going to play with the bone guy. So I get
[360.17s -> 372.79s]  extra projectiles. What do I want to play though? Not yet discovered. Stage two. Oh, the library.
[372.79s -> 380.78s]  Wait, so hold on. What should I do? This one? Can I do this? I can't do this one yet. Should I do
[380.78s -> 392.52s]  this one? The library? All right, let's go. See if I remember how to play this game. So all you do
[392.52s -> 397.24s]  for those who have no idea if those have never played, you literally walk around and the game
[397.24s -> 401.48s]  auto attacks enemies around you. And the game's harder and harder and harder. You get more and
[401.48s -> 405.80s]  more and more powerful and there's more and more and more enemies. It's so good. It's like one of
[405.80s -> 410.47s]  the best games ever made. Okay. So what do I want to do here? I probably, I like lightning
[411.11s -> 420.44s]  strikes at random enemies. You level up every so often. Check this out. Boom. See that? That's
[420.44s -> 424.76s]  lightning level one. There's like eight ranks. I think of 10 ranks of every eye of every weapon.
[425.72s -> 430.92s]  The little gems I'm picking up on the ground. That is experience points. When it fills up at the top,
[430.92s -> 436.42s]  you probably can guess what happens. I go, all right, what do I want?
[438.39s -> 442.15s]  I got to, you guys got to help me out here. Cause this is once you get two weapons to maximum,
[442.95s -> 450.39s]  once you level up and you get two weapons that can combine into a super weapon, I kind of don't
[450.39s -> 456.07s]  fucking remember. I know lightning didn't have one. Does lightning have a, an upgrade now?
[457.45s -> 466.25s]  Does lightning have an upgrade? It does. All right. How do I do it? It tells you what you
[466.25s -> 473.75s]  need to evolve now. Really? It's wings. The duplicator. Okay. So I'm going to, I'll go whip.
[473.75s -> 486.31s]  I like whip. Duplicator evolves lightning. Hell yeah. Lightning is my favorite move.
[486.31s -> 494.65s]  I'm not pressing any buttons. Just doing it automatically. By the way, this game is like
[494.65s -> 511.86s]  fucking $3. $3. That's, this is an ad. I mean, honestly, this is, this game is amazing. It's
[511.86s -> 516.46s]  through the three bucks. What do you want me to say? All right. 8% more experience. I like that.
[519.34s -> 526.14s]  Yeah. I want more EXP. This is making me want to play it. I'm excited. You know what I did?
[526.14s -> 530.46s]  The thing about early access, cause this game is in early access. I was sitting here going,
[530.46s -> 536.06s]  Oh wow, this game's so good. But it was so early. And I did the thing where I said, you know what?
[536.06s -> 542.38s]  I want to play it so bad. And this is like the last three or four months, but I just did not.
[542.38s -> 546.06s]  Cause I knew eventually, like right now I was going to get to a point where like, if there's
[546.06s -> 553.18s]  enough added, where there's way more for me to see. All right. So I already got bone. I'm
[553.18s -> 558.46s]  going to do bone level two last 0.2 seconds longer base area bite. Yeah. Let's go on level two.
[560.82s -> 570.36s]  Santa water is OP. It is, but I was that. Oh shit. Oh, okay. Don't be an idiot.
[574.01s -> 580.71s]  You do not die in one hit. You have health, but it's bad to get hit. Santa water has upgrade now.
[581.27s -> 586.04s]  I feel like I, did I play the one, the update that had the upgrade? I don't know.
[586.68s -> 595.34s]  The library is hard because it's not a whole lot of room to move around. There's a new enemy.
[595.34s -> 609.50s]  Do water and orb level two. Yeah. Yeah. I want more whip. Let's go. Whip is what? Whip is to
[609.50s -> 623.26s]  get the super whip. Whip and heart. Yeah. Okay. Hollow heart. Okay. Lightning again.
[624.14s -> 636.02s]  Do you say, do wings do anything? XP is early is good too. Yeah, but I want lightning. Let's go.
[636.66s -> 653.69s]  No, XP. Let's do it. So as time goes on, the game just gets harder. So you can really kind of blow
[653.69s -> 658.81s]  up a whole run. If you build without like enough damage or without enough health or speed,
[659.45s -> 679.16s]  you can blow up an entire run. All right. Does bone have an upgrade? I don't think this bone
[679.16s -> 684.25s]  doesn't have an upgrade, does it? No, it didn't have them before either. I want lightning.
[686.76s -> 691.59s]  Oh shit. What is that? Oh, one of the mod just linked an evolution chart. You're the best.
[696.71s -> 700.63s]  Bone is bad. Is it? I kind of, I like this guy. Is this guy at the bottom tier?
[701.59s -> 712.25s]  I thought this guy was good. Oh, chat gave it to me. Oh, chat is absolutely pog. Yeah,
[712.25s -> 720.12s]  bone bounces. I like, it can bounce off people. Can we go bone level three or do I get some
[720.12s -> 732.84s]  spinach? What do you think? I would say damage up and one more bone. Yeah, let's do that. That's
[732.84s -> 752.76s]  fucking pretty sick. Get the mouse off the screen by the way. Mortacio used to be the best character
[752.76s -> 757.91s]  in the game. Did they nerf this character? That one again. This thing's awesome. Did they give
[757.91s -> 762.79s]  an upgrade to this? Cause this thing's, this is incredible. This is the thing that bounces around
[762.79s -> 767.59s]  and goes through people. This thing's incredible, right? They did. All right. I want it. How do I do
[767.59s -> 776.63s]  it? I have no, I don't even know what this thing, how do I do it? Armor? I don't want to get screwed
[776.63s -> 782.31s]  up here though, because the thing is these are permanent. You can't take these off and you can
[782.31s -> 788.79s]  have six of each thing. There's six, there's a, see the top and the top left? The top is the weapon
[788.79s -> 792.63s]  slots and the bottom is the item slots. So you got to be careful. You don't screw it all up
[795.11s -> 802.10s]  because you, I can't pick anything else up. I'll do Rune Tracer. Yeah. Cause I want to see the
[802.10s -> 811.86s]  shit that I haven't seen. If I see armor, I'm getting it. God damn it. I'm, am I actually
[811.86s -> 817.50s]  going to stream like all fucking night? Yeah, probably. Yeah, let's go. I'm going to have to
[817.50s -> 827.43s]  take a break to eat something though. I would tell you right now, the stream is good. We're going to,
[827.43s -> 830.47s]  we're going to just kind of chill and just play this the fuck out of this for like the next,
[830.47s -> 837.10s]  at least three or four hours. So we're going to chill, just play, right? It's going to be fun.
[840.60s -> 852.30s]  I love this item. I just completed all my exams. Hell yeah. Hope you did good. This, you need this.
[852.38s -> 857.83s]  I, I need this because I'm terrible. Laurel sucks. I thought I, I'm, I'm awful at this game.
[860.90s -> 865.62s]  Let's, let's talk about what a chest does. Okay. So when you open a chest, it randomly,
[865.62s -> 869.34s]  depending on if you could get an Epic, a legendary, I don't know what it is yet.
[869.34s -> 872.78s]  It randomly upgrades one or two or three items that you have.
[879.82s -> 891.45s]  All right, cool. Yeah, that's good. I'll take it. That's good for me. You can get a legendary
[891.45s -> 904.52s]  chest. That's five random upgrades. And oh my God, does it feel good? Whip. I'm telling you right
[904.52s -> 917.37s]  now, I, me and Holly, we just, we just sit on the couch and I would just be high with my mouth open
[917.37s -> 927.90s]  just like watching her play. I would literally be sitting there like this for like two straight
[927.90s -> 942.07s]  hours. I'm doing whip again as it should be like, Hey, do you want to play? No, I just want to watch
[942.07s -> 959.94s]  you. Oh, dinner. Does that mean help? All right. I got it. So I, so now here's what happens.
[960.50s -> 967.69s]  So this is random, right? So if I max out the armor and I max out the rune tracer,
[968.68s -> 973.69s]  I can combine them. This is going to be awesome. I can't wait. All right. Don't tell me what it
[973.69s -> 978.65s]  does because I don't want to know. All right. Now this is a run, so I can't fuck it up. Don't be an
[978.65s -> 988.79s]  idiot. Once you confirm that you have the two items that you need to at least do one or two major
[988.79s -> 1001.29s]  upgrades, don't fuck it up. This is an auto battler, resident sleeper. No, you don't resident sleeper
[1001.29s -> 1005.53s]  vampire spires. I'm sorry. You just don't, you can't, you can't do that. This is like actually
[1005.53s -> 1023.50s]  like, I think illegal. Nice whip upgrade. Okay. Do I just rush this or do I just let it go? What
[1023.50s -> 1035.19s]  I meant 10 minutes is where it gets crazy. Go with Santa water. If I get Santa water, that's it.
[1035.19s -> 1042.50s]  I don't have any other room for upgrades for, for weapons. So I need, if I do Santa water, so I have
[1042.50s -> 1052.33s]  the rune tracer. I need the heart container for the whip. So that's two. Okay. I'll have enough
[1052.33s -> 1062.06s]  room, right? Well, I have enough. I can't make the decision yet. I don't know. Only the weapon
[1062.06s -> 1074.65s]  needs to be max. Really? I thought it was both. Really? Fire wand. This is it. All right. We got
[1074.65s -> 1081.94s]  the hollow heart. So now I I'll be able to get the max whip soon, which is huge. The max, max whip
[1081.94s -> 1100.87s]  has life steal too, which is crazy. Okay. So we're going to do lightning orb, rune tracer,
[1100.87s -> 1113.03s]  and whip mega upgrades. And okay. Yeah, let's do it. Because that, if this is Santa orb, right?
[1113.03s -> 1124.25s]  Santa. Um, let me see. Let me make sure. Yeah, it is. All right. Let's do it. Around the 10 minute
[1124.25s -> 1136.62s]  mark is where this gets wild. What's the lore for the game? I actually don't know. We're gonna do
[1136.62s -> 1150.18s]  bone. It's like Castlevania. Kind of reminds me of Castlevania. Bone again. Another projectile for
[1150.18s -> 1166.95s]  bone. So am I on level two for the library? Oh, it's getting wild. Resident sleeper. No, I mean,
[1166.95s -> 1181.19s]  we're, we're just chilling out now, right? Like, okay, if I'm going to, that's like the, I need to
[1181.19s -> 1186.63s]  pretend like this is crazy. So you don't leave, right? Like, oh, it's getting real. It's getting
[1186.63s -> 1191.51s]  wild. It's getting crazy guys. Oh, whoa. It's getting wild out here. So, you know, like we're
[1191.51s -> 1204.90s]  going to click the X. Oh, you don't want to miss this. No, I don't get. That thing explodes and I
[1204.90s -> 1219.16s]  might get hit. I need to wait. I haven't seen ruin tracer at all. Oh dude. It's getting wild.
[1219.96s -> 1226.89s]  Those things explode and they can kill you in like one hit. They really can. It's awful.
[1227.45s -> 1237.99s]  It's truly terrible. Oh, this is going to be awesome. Oh, it's getting wild. You see that?
[1237.99s -> 1241.91s]  Okay. Yep. I want the Santa water. Santa water drops a little like a little splashes.
[1242.87s -> 1256.78s]  There we go. Finally. What's the lightning upgrade? The ring, the duplicator. Okay. So
[1256.78s -> 1266.70s]  I don't want to take, I'll take the, uh, you kind of like the friend that's really interested in
[1266.70s -> 1276.74s]  the niche game. I mean that I don't know. Would you call this game niche right now? I feel like
[1276.74s -> 1283.75s]  this is like one of the most popular games on steam. I feel like this game is like wildly,
[1283.75s -> 1294.25s]  wildly popular. So in that first screen, I know like most of you guys have already played this,
[1294.25s -> 1297.45s]  I've seen this a million times, but in that first screen where you can do the power-ups,
[1298.01s -> 1302.01s]  see the little blue area of effect that's kind of like twinkling. That's kind of on the ground.
[1302.01s -> 1307.64s]  That does damage when people walk on it. When you first do the, you look, you do the power-up
[1307.64s -> 1313.96s]  screen, you do area of effect, you do cooldown reduction, right? You kind of build the character
[1313.96s -> 1324.38s]  the way I'm sorry. I bumped it. What do I want to do first? Probably this one from what I remember
[1324.38s -> 1327.82s]  the Santa water at high levels is fucking crazy. And I'm not going to square anymore. Cause like,
[1328.14s -> 1337.66s]  what was the point of saying the F word? Good. I'll take it.
[1346.01s -> 1354.50s]  The F word. Oh fuck. This is a pro tip for you. If you see a health on the ground and you have full
[1354.50s -> 1360.90s]  health, don't touch it. You might need it later and things do not despawn. It's a little,
[1360.90s -> 1373.75s]  that's a little pro tip for you. All right. We're almost at 10 minutes is where it gets hard.
[1375.02s -> 1379.58s]  This is where it determines if you have the right build to continue going. And oh my God,
[1379.58s -> 1384.26s]  it's about to get really wild here. I actually stopped fucking around because I don't want to
[1384.26s -> 1389.26s]  lose at 10 minutes. The game says, okay, you've been playing for a little while. Let's see if you
[1389.26s -> 1395.40s]  can actually beat it. Let's see if you have like a build that's worth playing. I'm going to do whip
[1395.40s -> 1413.86s]  cause it's closest. Okay. This is going to be huge. Oh, should I just do spell binder for the
[1413.86s -> 1430.33s]  Santa water? So wild, crazy, hyper insane. Oh, I think I'm just doing Santa water. Spell binder
[1430.33s -> 1450.92s]  also helps the bone. Yeah, I'm doing it. Spell binder again. You love to see that. That's awesome.
[1451.00s -> 1456.84s]  You love to see that happen. Okay. I'm going to do bone again, base damage, almost at the max bone.
[1460.31s -> 1472.78s]  Whoa. XP batches. All right. Bone is maximum. I cannot upgrade bone anymore. That's good. It's
[1472.78s -> 1481.46s]  going to be bouncing around and helping out. Oh, okay. Imagine, imagine, imagine bad chesting,
[1481.46s -> 1495.50s]  vampire survivors. What do you imagine? Bad chesting, vampire survivors. Who are you? Okay.
[1495.50s -> 1507.03s]  I want ruined tracer fires. Another projectile. I forget what this does.
[1507.75s -> 1528.30s]  Kills everything on the screen. Hell yeah. All right. Spell binder. Yeah. The red ones are worth
[1528.30s -> 1544.28s]  way more. All right. Am I missing any secondary item that I need? Wings is, um, no, cause I need
[1544.28s -> 1560.62s]  the duplicator. So I can't do that. I just do what Santa water again. Come on. You should smoke weed
[1560.62s -> 1571.50s]  on stream. I'm not going to do that. Why? For what? Chest. Actually I probably shouldn't touch that
[1573.13s -> 1578.97s]  because when you get to a max, you need to open it in a chest. Has that changed or is that the same?
[1579.77s -> 1589.62s]  It's the same. Okay. All right. So I don't want to touch that yet until I have something that's max.
[1589.62s -> 1600.60s]  So I can open the, um, yeah, I'm not going to touch it. Look at that area. Look at that area.
[1600.60s -> 1617.98s]  It's gotten so much bigger. Oh, wait. Are you guys bad chesting? Cause I'm saying like, oh, wow,
[1617.98s -> 1621.58s]  this is so cool. Look at how cool this is. That's why you, that's why you're doing that. Right.
[1633.86s -> 1641.02s]  You said chest. Oh, please attract or begin. Cause I don't want to use the sec. I don't,
[1641.02s -> 1666.42s]  I only have one more slot, so I'm not using it. I need a duplicator. I love this game. Yeah,
[1666.42s -> 1670.50s]  I do too. It's great. Don't listen to all the bat chest haters out there. Okay.
[1671.22s -> 1676.09s]  They're all just making it up. You can't not like this game. I don't think it's possible.
[1680.18s -> 1687.54s]  Oh, that bat means chest usually. That means whatever. Fuck off.
[1688.26s -> 1704.55s]  Fuck it. I, it actually does though. If you, if you kill one of those highlighted bats,
[1705.51s -> 1707.99s]  there is a very high chance that it's going to drop a chest.
[1711.56s -> 1723.51s]  It's been a while since I've seen a lightning. Stop. I know. Stop. You're making me swear. All
[1723.51s -> 1740.81s]  right. No one's wearing. I can't. Whatever. Dude, this isn't paper Mario. Wait, are you defending
[1740.81s -> 1748.28s]  the bat chesters or are you saying they shouldn't be doing it? Oh, all right. We're good. I got the
[1748.28s -> 1773.88s]  duplicator. Whip is going to be first, I think. So how long do I have to survive in the library now?
[1774.44s -> 1790.57s]  40 minutes at least 30 at least. Okay. I think I've done that or have I? Maybe I did 20.
[1791.21s -> 1801.05s]  All right. There's, there's two chests here. I think I'm just going to get this one. No.
[1802.07s -> 1822.92s]  Yeah. Okay. Let's get it. Whatever. All right. Don't open the other one. I'm surprised as many
[1822.92s -> 1827.11s]  people don't like know what this is. Well, hopefully some of you guys that didn't know
[1827.11s -> 1832.31s]  what this was, look at this and go, this is fucking hog champ. And I love it. There's a bat chest
[1832.31s -> 1853.62s]  right there. It'd take a while to kill. See, I told you. All right. There it is. I got whip level
[1853.62s -> 1867.06s]  eight. Check this out. Bloody tear. Evolve whip can deal critical damage and absorbs HP. Take a
[1867.06s -> 1885.16s]  look at it now. Now this thing is insane. Play more of this? Oh yeah. I'm going to play in this
[1885.16s -> 1905.19s]  rest of the night. I mean, I will, I will accept you. I will accept you bat chesting Glover,
[1905.19s -> 1912.02s]  but I am not going to stand here and let you bat chest vampire survivors. You have any,
[1912.02s -> 1918.04s]  you don't even know what you're saying. It's like, it's crazy to me. Bat chesting Glover. Okay. Oh,
[1918.12s -> 1941.24s]  Glover and 64. Whoa. Oh, excuse me. All right. Lightning level six. Yep. I want to try to get
[1941.24s -> 1955.42s]  the lightning one. I wonder what it does. All right. Lightning level eight. Here we go. Let's
[1955.42s -> 1968.87s]  do it. What does it do? Thunder loop, evolved lightning ring, projectile strike twice. Oh shit.
[1968.87s -> 1986.22s]  That's probably crazy. Whoa. Holy shit. All right. That was actually insane. All right. That's
[1986.22s -> 2019.77s]  actually insane. Don't pass over the duplicator. Um, I, I'm messing. This is a good run actually.
[2020.41s -> 2029.29s]  All right. Duplicator again. All right. What do we got here? Rune Tracer level six.
[2030.89s -> 2042.12s]  There's a good chance of winning this. Yeah. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Sometimes you just get
[2042.12s -> 2049.43s]  this dog shit and you just can't get something going. One more projectile base area by 20%.
[2049.43s -> 2057.77s]  Yep. Yeah. I win this one. This is going to be a win here. As long as I don't do anything like
[2057.77s -> 2071.96s]  boneheaded. What is that? Oh, okay. Level seven Santa water. Rune Tracer. Another projectile.
[2076.17s -> 2084.17s]  This one. Jesus. Okay. Rune Tracer is level eight. I'm ready to upgrade it. Oh my God. They're all
[2084.17s -> 2110.01s]  level eight. Um, where's the chest? What does this one do now? No future evolved Rune Tracer
[2110.01s -> 2131.22s]  explodes when bouncing and in retaliation explodes. Oh my God. I don't, I think it's
[2131.22s -> 2148.15s]  impossible that I possible to lose. I got another one, right? Hell yeah. LeBora evolved Santa water
[2148.15s -> 2157.90s]  damaging zones, follow you and grow when they move. Okay. Time for the bit rate to shit the bed.
[2157.90s -> 2184.52s]  Don't have a funny title. Don't go. Somebody said, don't commentate the game. I don't care.
[2186.87s -> 2189.91s]  Okay. Wait, what? What do you want? It won't just be quiet.
[2198.25s -> 2202.01s]  All right. The title of the stream is not vampire survivors. And then in brackets,
[2202.73s -> 2206.17s]  long play, no commentary. Although maybe I should change it to that.
[2206.17s -> 2222.89s]  Should I just change it to that? I have a joke. I'll do it. I'll do it for that person.
[2222.89s -> 2251.26s]  Okay. Here you go. Here's your joke.
[2251.26s -> 2450.01s]  Fuck. For one second. Shut the fuck up.
[2499.78s -> 2506.20s]  Like people saying like mute your mic, mute mic, idiot. Like stop talking. Like I've built a
[2506.20s -> 2510.52s]  reputation of being the guy that just doesn't talk on stream. And everyone's like pissed when I do.
[2511.56s -> 2531.98s]  And that would be a big controversy. That would be a huge controversy. If finally I just, I said
[2532.06s -> 2538.38s]  something and I'd be like, shut whatever. Like I sneezed once, like relax. And I lose like
[2538.38s -> 2543.72s]  fucking a thousand, like a thousand viewers or something. Lose like 10,000 viewers. That's not
[2543.72s -> 2570.20s]  what I'm here for. Voice revealed. Like stop talking. Stopped up. Like I did. I talked for
[2570.20s -> 2578.33s]  not even a second guys. Like relax. This game is so loud. Hold on. Is it really? Hold on. Let me fix
[2578.33s -> 2589.45s]  it. Is that better? I'm unstoppable right now. Your face cam quality is dog shit. What do you
[2589.45s -> 2617.67s]  want me to do? I don't, it's so hot in this room. I don't, I always take the money. Always.
[2630.84s -> 2655.10s]  I'm, I'm just, I, this is amazing. I can't fall asleep to this. Here we go. More money. More.
[2655.10s -> 2688.39s]  Give me more. More money. Can we get a bit rate Pog face? Yeah. It's too quiet now. Holy shit.
[2688.39s -> 2704.02s]  I forgot about this thing. This was actually a great start. This is a great start. I got to turn
[2704.02s -> 2731.54s]  on hyper mode next time. I'm going to do like hard mode. I'll try it. Face cam is too big.
[2754.26s -> 2767.86s]  It's still too big. No guys. I'm not muting my mic. No, I, I want to do some new content.
[2768.42s -> 2778.31s]  I'm not muting my mic. I want to do some new content. And I, you've, yeah, you know me over
[2778.31s -> 2783.35s]  the last five to 10 years as being the long play, no commentary and everything. But today I wanted
[2783.35s -> 2794.15s]  to, I just wanted to have you, I wanted to talk. Why is that such a big deal? I don't know. I don't
[2794.15s -> 2803.85s]  understand why. I want to change. I kind of have what I'm doing and not just do like no commentary.
[2803.85s -> 2806.25s]  If there's a lot of people there, I figured I could see if anyone's still like, can I hear
[2806.25s -> 2815.53s]  me talk and everything? If you don't like it, then just fucking leave. Okay. How's that sound?
[2817.70s -> 2823.50s]  I'm doing it. I want to, I'm taking my channel in a new direction. It's commentary. I know the title
[2823.50s -> 2845.54s]  says that, but I'll change the title. Rip 200 people. Why is it 200 people? I don't get it.
[2849.96s -> 2866.68s]  We made you. We made you. Do you know what I would want to do so bad? I would want to do a like long
[2866.68s -> 2871.96s]  play, no commentary video. And it's like six hours long and it's a game, but somewhere in the middle,
[2872.68s -> 2880.84s]  just do this huge shitty mic quality burp. It's just like, what the? Holy shit. What was that?
[2881.80s -> 2884.95s]  It's just like a,
[2889.59s -> 2898.81s]  and that's it. And like, or like have it be like a plate of food, like metal onto ceramic.
[2902.04s -> 2907.43s]  He's eating a chicken parm or something, but he's not talking just once for like 10 minutes
[2907.43s -> 2928.73s]  in the middle. That'd be so weird. Yeah. You hear a lawnmower open up in the background. Yep.
[2942.49s -> 2955.32s]  Oh my God. Wonder what it's going to be. Holy shit. Imagine getting this like 10 to 20 minutes ago.
[2955.32s -> 2973.30s]  I'll take the money. How can we look like a simulation? You can't do that in a simulation.
[2973.30s -> 3004.30s]  Stop. Graphics have not gotten that far. Damn. All right. I'm almost at 30 minutes. I'm making
[3004.30s -> 3028.63s]  so much money. This is what space invaders look like to a three-year-old me. I could see that.
[3029.27s -> 3049.69s]  I'm going to puke if I keep watching. Why? Just turn your bit rate down. Turn off the damage
[3049.69s -> 3054.73s]  numbers so you can see better. I kind of like the damage numbers though. Like, well, not this late,
[3054.73s -> 3079.26s]  but it helps to know like how much you're doing. I'm watching this at 160. All right. We'll go in
[3079.26s -> 3085.18s]  hard mode next time. I'm going to turn on hyper and I'm going to do first mode. See how crazy we can
[3085.18s -> 3129.05s]  make it. All right. And I got one minute, one minute to get as much money as I can. I got to
[3129.05s -> 3133.64s]  get out of this area here. There's so much experience down there. I'm going for it.
[3155.26s -> 3174.98s]  I did it. I did it. All right. Oh, I get to revive right because of the thing I bought. Let's go.
[3184.06s -> 3195.13s]  Ooh, I unlocked Cavallo. Reach level 100 with unlocks reroll. Reach level 40. Unlock Dairy Plant.
[3195.13s -> 3205.34s]  Unlocks Banish. All right. I got a new character. Evolve the Ruin Tracer. You can see how much
[3205.34s -> 3210.55s]  damage things were doing. Looks like the bloody, bloody tear was doing a lot. All right. I got to
[3210.55s -> 3220.22s]  try Cavallo. This is pretty fun, man. This is a pretty fun game. All right. What's Cus Cavallo?
[3220.22s -> 3229.59s]  Gets more projectiles every 20 levels. And he starts with, what is that? He's functionally
[3229.59s -> 3242.86s]  identical. What is this? What is this weapon? This is a new weapon. It's a cherry bomb. I'll try it.
[3242.86s -> 3249.06s]  That sounds cool. All right. So this guy, let me see. This is more projectiles every 20 levels.
[3249.06s -> 3254.89s]  So we want to do projectiles. So let's refund this here. So we're obviously going to do this
[3254.89s -> 3261.59s]  because one more projectile is just great off the bat. So if we're going to be based on projectiles,
[3261.59s -> 3277.54s]  I want to do projectile speed damage. I'll do move speed too. A little bit of Curse. Yeah,
[3277.54s -> 3293.59s]  cool down as well. Banish. Oh, these are new. These are new. Once per rank allows to remove
[3293.59s -> 3300.70s]  an item from level up choices for the rest of the run. So what? I can say I don't ever want
[3300.70s -> 3307.29s]  to see this again. Once per rank allows to get different choices when leveling up so I can
[3307.29s -> 3318.49s]  reroll. That's a lot of money though. 11,000. This is kind of cheap, right? Reroll is stupid.
[3318.49s -> 3330.09s]  It's almost all the half the money I have though. Should I do Curse? Or should I wait to do Curse
[3330.09s -> 3362.30s]  and do it later? I'll do 20%. I like that. I want luck too. Magnet maybe. Area. Yeah. Max Health.
[3362.30s -> 3373.78s]  Breed. All right. That's fine. Okay. So I'll try Cavallo. All right. This is a new weapon. Dairy
[3373.78s -> 3379.61s]  plant. The magic map hidden in here might finally lead us to a vampire or at least to more roast
[3379.61s -> 3402.18s]  chicken. Dairy. This is new. Am I standing up? Let's do it. So what is this move? So it is it.
[3402.18s -> 3407.51s]  Okay. It is. Whoa, it exploded. Why did it explode? They blow up. All right. That's cool.
[3411.14s -> 3417.72s]  Okay. I made the game 20% harder. Oh, garlic. Definitely garlic. No, no, I don't. I want
[3417.72s -> 3423.50s]  projectiles. This is not a projectile though. Santa water again probably. I like garlic. Let's do
[3423.50s -> 3429.43s]  garlic. I love garlic. So how garlic functions is see it just does this big zone around you.
[3430.15s -> 3434.82s]  I know this is not the build to do garlic but whatever. I like it. It's my favorite.
[3435.38s -> 3452.79s]  Is there a chest already? All right. Here we go. Projectiles. Do I want to do axe or knife?
[3453.43s -> 3465.13s]  Probably knife. I would say knife or Rune Tracer again. Yeah. Rune Tracer is just too good. Just
[3465.13s -> 3477.59s]  too good. Any wings? Is this technically a projectile? Because this is the bird fly around
[3477.59s -> 3484.92s]  you. You need to do two different birds. Is that a projectile or is that kind of something else?
[3490.73s -> 3498.14s]  Yes. Bird is a projectile. Okay. Bird is kind of hard to use early but late game it's stupid.
[3498.14s -> 3515.03s]  Oh, shit. All right. Is there a map hidden here instead? Should I go looking for it?
[3523.32s -> 3527.24s]  Holy shit. Thank God for garlic. Otherwise, I probably would have gotten killed.
[3527.96s -> 3543.16s]  Oh, sorry. Killed. I probably would have gotten killed. More cherry bomb. Does cherry bomb have
[3543.16s -> 3556.62s]  an evolution? What's the cherry bomb evolution? No? Oh, shit. Okay. Well,
[3557.34s -> 3566.74s]  I'm going to do it. It's a great weapon though. It seems like it. It seems really good.
[3584.73s -> 3597.29s]  Chest. All right. Give me a legendary right now. Garlic. Legendary. Garlic again. That's actually
[3597.29s -> 3605.16s]  awesome. He's ignoring us? No, I'm looking over here every like 15 seconds. For a great
[3605.16s -> 3610.82s]  germa, you should relaunch the stream at like 3000 up and see how crusty it is.
[3615.08s -> 3621.11s]  Didn't I do that one time? I remember back in like 2016 when I was first starting streaming.
[3623.05s -> 3635.32s]  Oh, definitely Bible. I remember playing like Overwatch at like 100k up. All right. I have to
[3635.32s -> 3642.36s]  get the other bird. I can't do anything else. No more new weapons. It has to be the other bird.
[3642.36s -> 3667.29s]  Garlic. Bible. Tome. Speed. Equal. Yeah. All right. What do I need here? I need garlic in what?
[3667.29s -> 3683.94s]  Garlic in something else. Danish the garlic. I like garlic. Here we go. All right. So this is
[3684.66s -> 3691.66s]  Pumarola is the evolution for garlic. I'm going to get that. This is my first stream that I'm
[3691.66s -> 3706.06s]  watching. Really? What's up? How you doing? Welcome to the stream. First stream too? Really? There's
[3706.06s -> 3719.27s]  a lot of new viewers today. Where'd you come from? Where'd all you guys come from? Garlic again.
[3722.39s -> 3728.71s]  Garlic saves your life. It really does. I would have gotten hit probably three or four more times
[3728.71s -> 3746.90s]  already. I came from what? Gotta stay hydrated. It's a gaming sesh man. Gotta stay hydrated.
[3750.28s -> 3753.24s]  Blood looked like doom so I started watching and then this kept me here. Oh, cool. All right.
[3760.50s -> 3782.73s]  There's the other bird. All right. Now we got to get the birds up. Watch out for this Minotaur.
[3782.73s -> 3796.12s]  Oh, he didn't drop anything? I just popped into the stream. I'm already considered buying it.
[3797.61s -> 3802.38s]  Yeah. I want to say I'm curious how many hours I have in this game.
[3803.10s -> 3813.86s]  I should just get the duplicator just because garlic and okay. It's just, it's like one of the
[3813.86s -> 3832.17s]  best items in the whole game. Of course I am. Nice. Here we go. Very good. I'll take it. Yeah. No
[3832.17s -> 3848.20s]  reason to pass it up ever. How high is garlic level six or something? All right. The Bible is,
[3848.20s -> 3867.58s]  let me look at my cheat sheet. Bible and spell binder and then it's garlic and heart. I already
[3867.58s -> 3887.02s]  have it and then it's rune tracer and armor. Okay. So I need armor and I need, um, spell binder
[3891.69s -> 3903.16s]  and then we're good to go for a while. I wonder if I should just get this too.
[3904.79s -> 3911.75s]  Will I have enough? I need one, two, three. I'll have enough. Yeah. I'm just going to get it.
[3911.75s -> 3920.15s]  Just damage, straight up damage is insane. I'm done doing it. That's going to be like 50% more
[3920.15s -> 3932.06s]  damage. What I was going to say is I've already played this game a lot. The really slow burn of
[3932.06s -> 3938.23s]  progression in this game is really, really, really fun. Unlocking each new thing and kind of getting
[3938.23s -> 3944.46s]  better and better and better and better. It's awesome. Okay. I can't do that. We'll do this.
[3944.46s -> 3960.15s]  Yeah. Also crew ran X and chat made a lot of the pixel art for the game. Are they still here?
[3960.95s -> 3987.32s]  Really? That's pretty awesome. Oh my God. I'm going to die. Okay. Definitely cherry bomb. No.
[3987.32s -> 3997.34s]  Yeah. Spinach. I'm not entirely confident. I think I screwed this up a little bit. It's all right.
[3997.34s -> 4004.14s]  All right. Here we go. Spell binder. Hell yeah. I can get the Bible now. Did I need wings for
[4004.14s -> 4014.22s]  anything? No, right? I don't think so. How come you're a sloth? Do you think I look like a sloth?
[4016.06s -> 4024.34s]  I don't know. Oh, I thought you were talking about me and then like the camera in the top right. I
[4024.34s -> 4028.66s]  was like, I don't know. Do you think I look like a sloth? I kind of could see it for a second. That's
[4028.66s -> 4034.65s]  why I didn't say anything. I kind of like, I was like, yeah, I guess like I kind of, maybe I do a
[4034.65s -> 4050.97s]  little. I don't know. You're talking about that as a panda. I'll take it. Who can complain about
[4050.97s -> 4066.66s]  damage? Oh fuck. Okay. I need health. Is there health down here? I did make the game 20% harder.
[4067.46s -> 4096.90s]  So I gotta be careful. Jesus. How far down is this? Where the hell is this thing? Did I even go all
[4096.90s -> 4109.00s]  the way down here? When did I come down here? This is so far away. I'm not touching that yet.
[4110.14s -> 4115.37s]  How far? What the hell? Oh, the title needs to change. Oh shit. I'm probably like dumping
[4115.37s -> 4122.66s]  viewers. I'm dumping fucking viewers right now. The title is still there. I forgot about the title.
[4125.77s -> 4129.93s]  People probably are coming and they're like, ah, am I dumping? Am I? Are people? No, I haven't lost
[4129.93s -> 4167.51s]  that many. Hold on. I gotta change this. How about 160p is fine. Relax. That's better, right? I'm
[4167.51s -> 4178.23s]  leaving because you talked. All right. We got the upgrade. Let's go. Let's go. I need to minimize
[4178.23s -> 4193.26s]  this window, but I can't. I love the garlic and the Bible. It's just awesome. It's like the double
[4193.90s -> 4209.53s]  rings. Hell yeah. You can play Kirby's Air Ride maybe. Hey, it was free. I'll take upgrades.
[4209.53s -> 4271.27s]  Can you make the webcam 160p? I could try. I don't think I can. Let's find out. Yeah, I can.
[4271.27s -> 4302.23s]  There's no difference. This is at 160p. It's not that bad. It'll be worse. Why am I cross-eyed?
[4302.23s -> 4326.65s]  Oh, it's because my eye is like drifting this way. Make your voice robotic? No. It doesn't
[4326.65s -> 4364.28s]  like movement, right? Doom guy? Can I change this back? Can I even change this back? What was it
[4364.28s -> 4395.03s]  before? 720? Yeah, it was like, no, it was 1080, wasn't it? Yeah, it was 1080. Can I bring it back?
[4395.03s -> 4423.78s]  Where is it? What the fuck? What happened? What happened? That was weird. This is very weird.
[4423.78s -> 4444.58s]  Why is it like this? I tried to make it. Okay, there we go. All right, we're back. That's fine.
[4444.58s -> 4450.06s]  All right, I gotta get back into this. Eye only. No, no, eye only. That's fucking stupid. That's
[4450.06s -> 4472.46s]  cringe. Are you cringe? Okay, you sure? No, you sure? Okay, there's no enemies here. Why did I
[4472.46s -> 4481.88s]  pick this up? That was stupid. You save that when there's too many things on the screen. You just
[4481.88s -> 4488.55s]  get a ton of exp really quick. I still don't know what's down here, but I don't remember being down
[4488.55s -> 4502.82s]  here. The webcam looks worse. No, it doesn't. Okay, people said, you should get a better webcam. I
[4502.82s -> 4511.53s]  don't want a better camera. You can see every inch of my ugly face if I had a very
[4511.93s -> 4521.75s]  expensive DSLR or something. No, no, thank you. No, thanks. You'd be able to see the nose hairs I
[4521.75s -> 4532.42s]  have. I don't know. I don't like that. I don't know. I don't want you to see that. I'm actually
[4532.42s -> 4554.81s]  confused. Where is this thing? I want this thing to die. Oh shit. Die already, please.
[4554.81s -> 4580.86s]  Oh my god, die. Uh-oh. That's a good, I'll take it. All right, I need to break like a box or something
[4580.86s -> 4595.78s]  because I'm dead. Are there boxes? I know that this box is in the world, but where are they?
[4596.49s -> 4603.64s]  What do they look like on this map? What the fuck? I can't go that way.
[4604.36s -> 4615.37s]  Oh, there's like a, oh, it's a magic map. That's what it is. Permanently enables the map in the
[4615.37s -> 4648.01s]  pause menu. What? What does this mean? What's that mean? I'm dead. Well, I got the unlockable.
[4648.01s -> 4654.71s]  I gotta beat it with a bear. Do it again. Do it again. Come on, come on, come on.
[4654.71s -> 4666.79s]  Let's go. All right, no fucking around. Let's go. I'm ready. Axe. Projectiles.
[4666.79s -> 4690.18s]  This is Rick and Morty theme song. All right, no garlic. It didn't help us. Knife.
[4694.81s -> 4710.30s]  I'm not making a stupid joke. That's what it just sounded like. How many seasons do you think Rick
[4710.30s -> 4714.14s]  and Morty is going to go before they cancel it? Or do you think they will cancel it? Do you think
[4714.14s -> 4736.49s]  it'll go as long as like the Simpsons? Maybe one or two more? What is it out now? Season five?
[4736.49s -> 4751.98s]  I bet you it goes to season seven. The merch alone makes adults swim millions. Yeah.
[4752.62s -> 4777.40s]  Hell yeah. I got the bracers. Let's go. All right. I'm kind of getting shit on here.
[4791.59s -> 4812.87s]  Ooh, that actually worked really well. Fuck. Knife. I need damage now.
[4812.87s -> 4833.18s]  Surprise this is a dead run. I need damage now. This is a dead run. You picked up the worst item
[4833.18s -> 4854.84s]  in the game? Uh, ba ba ba. That's all I hear. You just picked up the worst item in the game.
[4854.84s -> 4881.83s]  What item? The knife? It's a challenge run, dude. Do the barrels open? Oh, Jesus. No! Fuck. I'm dead.
[4881.83s -> 4897.48s]  This place is hard. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
[4897.48s -> 4903.53s]  I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it right now. Let's go. That's it. No more bullshit. No more
[4903.53s -> 4920.38s]  bullshit. Fire. The lamp post of the drop items. Thank you so much. I've never would have guessed
[4920.38s -> 4930.98s]  it. It's okay. I don't like this level. Everything looks like it's on the same plane, but like I
[4930.98s -> 4938.68s]  can't move over this. It's hard to tell. It's like that in a lot of places. Pentagram erases
[4938.68s -> 4965.21s]  everything in sight. It's Ruin Tracer. Every time. Especially now that they can be upgraded.
[4965.21s -> 4977.98s]  Put a webcam on the character. How am I going to be able to do that? Yeah, Santa water is amazing.
[4977.98s -> 4990.30s]  check the map I'm so confused so what I could try the items that I can go get or
[4990.30s -> 5011.40s]  something so I need this for the Santa water pop left you can go over the item
[5011.40s -> 5018.03s]  cap if you get the items in the map really so should I not pick this up
[5018.03s -> 5036.41s]  they're far away oh fire want to move your webcam away from the level display
[5036.41s -> 5055.86s]  yeah that's a good idea there we go all right this is not a bad start
[5055.86s -> 5103.18s]  could be better yeah my ass hurts fuck oh god all right I need more damage you
[5103.18s -> 5108.53s]  know man the curse really does make the game so much harder because they're
[5108.53s -> 5143.94s]  faster than me 20% damn it fuck come on something good that's our it's not bad
[5143.94s -> 5156.83s]  because that's 20% more damage oh shit this is bad really bad dude fuck you
[5156.83s -> 5169.89s]  fuck okay okay okay I gotta go dude how am I supposed to get through that what
[5169.89s -> 5181.18s]  the fuck I'm dead no way no fucking way no way all right I gotta take the curse
[5181.18s -> 5215.30s]  off this level is fucking hard yeah I know no way not here speed area oh wait
[5215.30s -> 5219.42s]  do the expensive upgrades first right so what's the most expensive probably this
[5219.42s -> 5230.02s]  one and then this one and then I want the damage it's just so good
[5230.02s -> 5236.51s]  cool down is amazing speed is amazing I need movement speed all right now what
[5236.51s -> 5251.67s]  do I want growth recovery is good too yeah because that's that's a pretty
[5251.67s -> 5267.10s]  decent amount max health and growth growth and area and okay all right can I
[5267.10s -> 5276.73s]  do anything else agreed okay all right this is fine maybe I should have tried a
[5276.73s -> 5286.98s]  different character I like the starting with the lightning it's great permanent
[5286.98s -> 5295.75s]  plus 30% area starts with temporary cooldown bonus 30% area 10% more
[5295.79s -> 5303.73s]  experience every five levels that's huge permanent plus 40% duration and speed
[5303.73s -> 5312.41s]  this guy's so low as shit though maybe I could probably still do it on the bear I
[5312.41s -> 5316.94s]  have to do I have to beat it on the bear don't I yeah let's try it again all right
[5316.94s -> 5320.78s]  this time I don't have the curse so now they're not like 20% more 20% faster 20%
[5320.78s -> 5341.00s]  more damage then I'll be fine Domino's pizza I'm gonna eat I'll get the green
[5341.00s -> 5355.26s]  one yeah keep forgetting all right cross or garlic no cross mmm I like garlic
[5355.26s -> 5373.22s]  though I'm doing it okay now we'll do peach on I didn't mean to touch that
[5373.22s -> 5398.27s]  but I did race spinach team garlic garlic is really good it just helps it
[5398.27s -> 5407.40s]  just I can't like oh I was to throw up patriotic what's up I didn't spew it I'm

[5534.42s -> 5549.77s]  it's a huge area yeah what is axe turning to oh shit there it is
[5549.77s -> 5566.64s]  fire wand yep all right the seeds have been planted this is the one is a major
[5566.64s -> 5571.40s]  seizure warning late game here really I turned off the I checked the box that's
[5571.40s -> 5583.37s]  to make the photosensitive sensitivity mode active I'm getting Laurel ignores
[5583.37s -> 5612.30s]  my question he likes radiohead yeah I told the story how me my friends used to
[5612.30s -> 5616.18s]  jump around on a trampoline while that song was blasting on a stereo next to
[5616.18s -> 5624.55s]  the trampoline right everything is that story I did okay yeah just making sure
[5624.55s -> 5631.89s]  you know we would be just jumping it was like three or four of us just jumping in
[5631.89s -> 5638.41s]  a circle they're like do do do do do do do do do do it was the stereo was kind
[5638.41s -> 5645.07s]  of far away it was next to the trampoline but far enough away yeah
[5645.07s -> 5658.64s]  paranoid Android dude nothing will I think ever compare to doing the
[5658.64s -> 5663.94s]  trampoline jump in a circle thing well a CD is just blasting next to the
[5663.94s -> 5691.01s]  trampoline gimme it oh my god legendary if you're like 12 that's cool I that's
[5691.01s -> 5722.06s]  what I said when you were a kid huge huge oh that's huge this is looking like
[5722.06s -> 5736.27s]  a pretty good one so far Connor is permanently in your head rent free but
[5736.27s -> 5748.55s]  the huge thing I love numbers how much does this game cost looks really fun
[5748.55s -> 5754.53s]  well I have got a really really good news for you this game is not $20 it's
[5754.53s -> 5767.10s]  not $15 not even $10 this game can be yours for one easy payment $2.99 that's
[5767.10s -> 5779.06s]  right that's right that's not I did that wasn't a typo $3 but the amount that it
[5779.06s -> 5786.06s]  costs for you to buy three hash browns from McDonald's will get you this game
[5786.06s -> 5796.23s]  oh fuck I can't you're right I can't evolve the bird oh it's alright I get I
[5796.23s -> 5806.87s]  still got it shit it's okay it's alright I got enough mmm I wasn't paying
[5806.87s -> 5830.36s]  attention the run is ruined I think I'll be fine all right it's gonna be it's
[5830.36s -> 5863.19s]  gonna be a garlic carry anyways really go all right give me another legendary
[5863.19s -> 5875.40s]  garlic legendary why would you buy less than three hash browns when the
[5875.40s -> 5878.60s]  McDonald's breakfast is it's just one of those things where you completely
[5878.60s -> 5883.17s]  forget it exists until for some reason you just up at like six o'clock in the
[5883.17s -> 5895.73s]  morning you're like y'all that's what we're doing right now McDonald's is so
[5895.73s -> 5899.39s]  ridiculous I mean other places do this too but McDonald's just has two
[5899.39s -> 5907.22s]  completely different operating menus it's crazy the McDonald's breakfast menu
[5907.26s -> 5912.90s]  it's just like it's a completely different restaurant and some could
[5912.90s -> 5921.74s]  argue it's okay this is not on quiet it's not you me all right we're good
[5921.74s -> 5928.45s]  it's so expensive is the breakfast stuff more expensive than okay it's like a
[5928.45s -> 5932.81s]  double cheeseburger from McDonald's more expensive than and a sausage egg
[5932.81s -> 5948.51s]  McMuffin are they the same McMuffin is more is it really it's about the same I
[5948.51s -> 5953.77s]  wonder why maybe see ingredients cuz don't doesn't McDonald's use real
[5953.77s -> 5958.41s]  cracked eggs like a real egg that they like they have to actually crack it in
[5958.41s -> 5968.59s]  the morning right no they don't they do yeah they do it's only for some of the
[5968.59s -> 5973.19s]  stuff yeah but for like a sausage egg McMuffin has like a they crack it into
[5973.19s -> 5981.34s]  a little thing and cook it in there I'm almost certain they do god damn I'm
[5981.34s -> 5989.66s]  sorry I keep punching you they do yeah they have real and they have fake yeah
[5989.66s -> 5993.98s]  that's what I mean like it's some of the items have like actually somebody
[5993.98s -> 6006.30s]  actually crack the egg and cook it you guys ever just get in the mood
[6006.94s -> 6012.54s]  where you just want to crack like three eggs in a pan and just like flip them up
[6012.54s -> 6021.29s]  over easy and just eat each egg in one bite does anybody else do that I take
[6021.29s -> 6027.81s]  each egg and I go scoop it up I fold it in my mouth mmm and I eat the whole egg
[6027.81s -> 6031.05s]  in one bite and just kind of let it just kind of mush it around and eat it it's
[6031.05s -> 6039.52s]  so good I love doing that I love it cuz I'm I don't like when the yoke breaks
[6039.56s -> 6044.93s]  and gets all over everything else I'm not I don't like that if I have eggs on
[6044.93s -> 6047.97s]  a plate let's say if I go to a breakfast place or if I'm gonna have eggs in the
[6047.97s -> 6057.06s]  morning or something those eggs are being eaten in one bite why are you a
[6057.06s -> 6071.27s]  snake no but I get that energy I mean it you don't you know I'm not talking
[6071.27s -> 6083.14s]  about like you like no you pick it up and you like fold it up and you let you
[6083.14s -> 6098.72s]  eat it I don't like when the yoke breaks and gets all over everything else I like
[6098.72s -> 6104.08s]  enjoying an over easy egg completely on its own with the yoke and the white at
[6104.08s -> 6118.40s]  the same time now there is an exception right if you eat sort of around the yoke
[6118.40s -> 6124.62s]  you don't break it I do that too so you'll get the egg white kind of around
[6124.62s -> 6131.52s]  the middle can't go that way I'll eat I'll eat that and then you just take the
[6131.52s -> 6134.68s]  whole yoke that has a little bit of the whites surrounding it you eat the whole
[6134.68s -> 6140.82s]  thing in one bite how do you guys eat your eggs you let me guess you guys like
[6140.86s -> 6145.26s]  cut cut cut cut spread spread spread and then it touches all your other food and
[6145.26s -> 6153.78s]  then after about five minutes you have this cold yoke this cold gooey liquid
[6153.78s -> 6174.51s]  all over all your other shit yuck omelets are better omelets are amazing
[6174.51s -> 6187.52s]  those are incredible the yoke is like extra sauce yeah I would feel that way
[6187.52s -> 6193.84s]  if it didn't turn it okay yoke when it's broken after a few minutes changes
[6193.84s -> 6200.64s]  it turns into this half kind of solid congealed liquid but not liquid sometimes
[6200.64s -> 6210.77s]  it like heart I don't know mmm hard-boiled eggs are amazing but you
[6210.77s -> 6216.32s]  have to eat them right when you make them I would still eat hard but we
[6216.32s -> 6220.07s]  already went over the hard-boiled egg stuff right hold on I don't want to die
[6220.07s -> 6229.73s]  how have I not gotten anything to upgrade these yet that's kind of insane
[6230.13s -> 6237.62s]  deviled eggs are amazing deviled eggs can be incredible but they gotta be
[6237.62s -> 6245.03s]  fresh I'll be the first person in line when the deviled eggs come out I'll be
[6245.03s -> 6248.53s]  the last person in line when they've been out for more than five to ten
[6248.53s -> 6255.82s]  minutes like after a deviled egg has been out for like 20 minutes nope we've
[6255.82s -> 6270.94s]  been over this already yeah but there's new people here so much experience here
[6270.94s -> 6282.63s]  yeah eat food however you want right I'm just telling you how I do it and how you
[6282.67s -> 6302.50s]  do it is wrong right that's the point how come you're the panda I'm the panda the pandas

[6384.18s -> 6392.49s]  breathing fire items look at how much shit would be oh this would be crazy if
[6392.49s -> 6408.34s]  I could just have something to show up right now how have I haven't gotten
[6408.34s -> 6437.15s]  anything to upgrade these that seems impossible really hmm this thing's the

[6934.05s -> 6940.74s]  right that's max that's actually incredible I talked a lot of shit about
[6940.74s -> 6949.44s]  that up weapon but that's really good the area of it that explosion area is
[6949.48s -> 6955.52s]  massive after this go to bed I'll do like no I'm not yet I'll do a few more
[6955.52s -> 6961.96s]  maybe like one or two more I want to see what I unlock from this because I'm
[6961.96s -> 6973.98s]  definitely gonna unlock something if I beat this so not quite my still I still
[6973.98s -> 6979.14s]  need to do the fire one all right I'm gonna try to get to the question mark
[6979.14s -> 7000.00s]  that's really far away but let's see if I can get there why are you trying to
[7000.00s -> 7013.12s]  send 36 year old man to bed I don't want to go to bed you go to bed right this
[7013.16s -> 7029.86s]  instant mister right now I will in a little bit maybe one or two more is that
[7029.86s -> 7042.42s]  I was gonna make a line to that all right I'm getting there just stay I'm
[7042.42s -> 7054.76s]  gonna go this way 10 more minutes it's gonna be close feel like I'm not
[7054.76s -> 7082.08s]  clearing that fast like I was on the first run give me that it's your stream
[7082.08s -> 7086.16s]  you should go as long as you want yeah oh yeah no I'm good I'll be good for a
[7086.16s -> 7089.97s]  little while I told you this is this is we're just winding down here this is the
[7089.97s -> 7096.62s]  chill part of the screen see we had three different streams today we had
[7096.62s -> 7103.26s]  like the kind of wild first two or three hours with that scary game then we had
[7103.26s -> 7107.94s]  the middle gamer moments where I was playing the FPS gaming and now we're in
[7107.94s -> 7111.62s]  the chill mode we don't talk about Glover that didn't happen
[7111.62s -> 7149.77s]  ooh I definitely want that that's gonna kill everything in one hit pick up all
[7149.77s -> 7158.16s]  the stuff hurry that first run was seriously so good that's exactly what
[7158.16s -> 7175.93s]  you want to have happen every time this one's not bad though luck I don't
[7175.93s -> 7180.06s]  understand what's happening uh I'm walking around and things are dying
[7180.06s -> 7189.98s]  that's pretty much all you really need to know all right eight minutes can I do
[7189.98s -> 7203.23s]  it how far how close am I my still that far away I think I'm gonna be here for a
[7203.23s -> 7220.54s]  while fire wand again just walk in a circle
[7220.54s -> 7229.56s]  fire wand again base damage up what is the fire it turns into like a meteor or
[7229.56s -> 7249.28s]  something right one more and I need a chest there's no Glover footage to
[7249.28s -> 7264.30s]  upload what do you mean all right there it is and what do you know just right
[7264.30s -> 7275.58s]  here it's like a meteor hellfire passes through enemies evolved fire one right
[7275.58s -> 7280.11s]  this thing's really deadly if I remember y'all yeah this thing's insane all right
[7280.11s -> 7283.87s]  I'm good to go I should get to 30 minutes because I don't think there's a
[7283.87s -> 7309.41s]  world where I don't almost maxed out here and then it's just get money hey
[7309.41s -> 7318.77s]  what's a bluffer I don't go too far there's no reason to go far because I
[7318.77s -> 7323.50s]  won't I'll miss out on money you just want to at this stage if you got a
[7323.50s -> 7327.02s]  really insane building you can't even do anything else just stand in the middle
[7327.02s -> 7336.00s]  and just collect money this is pretty much a locked in when I think I could
[7336.00s -> 7345.00s]  try to go get the question mark but I think I feel like I'm too far could I
[7345.00s -> 7357.26s]  you think I could I get there in time you think I'll make it it might be too
[7357.26s -> 7390.95s]  far I'll try kind of just southeast maybe I can't make it five minutes yeah
[7390.95s -> 7405.22s]  I'll get it turn on map guides guide guides show guides what oh that's
[7405.22s -> 7412.57s]  interesting okay I gotta be careful this is I could die really quickly if I'm not
[7412.57s -> 7435.75s]  okay hold on stop moving is it a key I wonder what that is good even though I'm
[7435.75s -> 7439.55s]  really powerful you still if I lose the Laurel you die in one second to these
[7439.55s -> 7445.71s]  enemies if they touch you you'd lose 30 40 percent per second you can die very
[7445.71s -> 7457.12s]  easily right now I have the two yeah right I have to revive to you right I
[7457.12s -> 7477.68s]  shouldn't be all that concerned Jesus how close am I now all right I'm almost
[7477.68s -> 7504.87s]  there there's a chest after nothing can be in there anyways so what is it it is
[7504.87s -> 7520.66s]  coffin what is it what is this thing thank you

[7540.48s -> 7548.64s]  all right now just live just survive I mean I could get this one this is pretty
[7548.64s -> 7561.46s]  close I think just live you're gonna eat a glove on stream it's yeah it's it's
[7561.46s -> 7565.62s]  currently midnight it's like three o'clock in the morning almost Eastern on
[7565.62s -> 7570.99s]  April 24th free stooges are not in fortnight although I wonder what what
[7571.15s -> 7576.29s]  legal battle was going on behind the scenes it was I don't know so I'm gonna
[7576.29s -> 7584.58s]  have to eat a I'm gonna need a glove on screen whatever it's gonna be so funny

[7603.60s -> 7616.76s]  not even gonna scream tomorrow that's just free money you gotta give me a
[7616.76s -> 7621.66s]  little bit of time to be able to find out what kind of glove I want to eat so
[7621.66s -> 7627.06s]  we talking baseball glove we talking surgical glove are we talking what kind
[7627.06s -> 7630.34s]  of glove are you talking about here like a mittens like a mitten we're going
[7630.34s -> 7645.12s]  outside in the snow it has to be a glover glove a Mickey Mouse glove white
[7645.12s -> 7657.02s]  just a baseball glove love to do a poll all right mods let's see a poll yeah
[7657.02s -> 7662.22s]  yeah mods even here it's really late when I I would be surprised if there are
[7662.22s -> 7672.53s]  a lot of mods here give it up for the mods by the way it's very late all right
[7672.53s -> 7682.54s]  baseball glove Mickey Mouse slash Glover glove big okay no baseball glove cartoon
[7682.54s -> 7720.72s]  white glove surgical glove or winter mitten they go oh my goodness that's a
[7720.72s -> 7729.64s]  wall in front of me that's a wall in front of me that's a wall I can't go
[7729.64s -> 7761.33s]  down I think I'm fine I have to revive twice just give me the
[7761.33s -> 7781.69s]  points yeah master hand glove is cartoon white glove okay hyper dairy plant
[7781.69s -> 7800.98s]  popiah and gallo tower very cool make a glove pizza hamburger helper glove is
[7800.98s -> 7806.99s]  white cartoon glove it's Glover Mickey Mouse hamburger helper they're all the
[7808.83s -> 7813.99s]  same yeah Glover counts as a cartoon glove what is it at right now okay so it
[7813.99s -> 7828.91s]  looks like cartoon white glove survive ten minutes with okay all right what is
[7828.91s -> 7846.50s]  a popiah gains 1% duration every level what does that mean what does this move
[7846.50s -> 7854.19s]  the duration of her weapon effect ah there's no maximum that seems kind of
[7854.19s -> 7863.61s]  insane holy water Bibles bones really so I should do even more duration then okay
[7863.61s -> 7877.42s]  duration 30% more duration more area projectile I definitely want luck pull
[7877.42s -> 7899.42s]  down speed all right it looks like it's gonna be a cartoon white glove now
[7899.42s -> 7909.53s]  that's way too much on this again I want try even get the duplicate yeah I guess
[7909.53s -> 7937.86s]  so what else do I even want growth is so important moving speed good 4,000
[7937.86s -> 7951.26s]  advantage is cheap I was just take it I think that's good all right so we're
[7951.26s -> 7959.78s]  looking for duration stuff duration so yeah what is this I'm interested what
[7959.78s -> 7969.38s]  this move is gallo tower I'll try gallo tower yeah so I eat eat a cartoon white
[7969.38s -> 7984.12s]  glove you got it whoa okay this thing is awesome does this have a level up it
[7984.12s -> 7992.89s]  evolves with the in-game curse item what gloves should German eat no channel
[7992.89s -> 8014.60s]  points this time wait what none of these have a duration axe maybe or whip mmm
[8014.60s -> 8026.80s]  cross is good this weapon is awesome though all right duration is the ebony
[8026.80s -> 8033.70s]  wings is that duration I think it is right all right this time don't screw
[8033.70s -> 8042.50s]  this up and get the other bird this is a really this is really small area as it
[8042.50s -> 8051.54s]  just vertical it's a great character to take here gets the vertical cross again
[8051.54s -> 8073.82s]  song of mana base area up a hundred percent this thing is like s-tier this
[8073.82s -> 8085.34s]  is insane can anybody else get this or is this just just her this item is
[8085.34s -> 8092.09s]  basically garlic but good she's really busted late game Chris is always with
[8092.09s -> 8106.27s]  duration we got duration how do we get with this oh this is awesome okay what's
[8106.27s -> 8119.85s]  the red skeleton why okay white cartoon glove one again there's the Bible yep
[8119.85s -> 8132.58s]  hi this looks like a win already just don't be an idiot there it is all right
[8132.62s -> 8143.74s]  I got both the birds this character is awesome this is probably the best
[8143.74s -> 8149.29s]  character in the game cool down I think I want cool down what is cool down scale
[8149.29s -> 8161.94s]  with magic wand all right so I should probably get magic one the last one
[8161.94s -> 8167.70s]  right where's it no sorry is it rune tracer I thought it was magic one magic
[8167.70s -> 8178.35s]  wand is bad but it's okay the wand sucks don't even get it I definitely want this
[8178.35s -> 8196.73s]  do not get magic one magic wand eventually turns into a machine gun
[8197.02s -> 8204.13s]  it doesn't stop right there's rune tracer do I want that as my last lot
[8204.13s -> 8213.85s]  though because I can't I guess I could yeah duration it lasts a lot longer yeah
[8213.85s -> 8240.42s]  this is the character to play here cool down effect lastly I was just level this

[8524.87s -> 8532.23s]  gonna keep moving cuz they respond but it takes him like a second or two so
[8532.23s -> 8558.21s]  all right level eight this is the max I can get for this so it's pretty much on
[8558.21s -> 8569.86s]  it's on permanently it's cool but it actually is kind of impeding my vision
[8569.86s -> 8596.70s]  it's giving me a bad bitrate on my own computer screen um anything on this map
[8596.70s -> 8603.62s]  that's like a question mark or anything oh this chest although wait let me go

[9690.64s -> 9703.95s]  get something up because we're getting a ten minutes here yeah this would be the
[9703.95s -> 9713.60s]  last run to whatever happens here this is it I've got a win there we go I'll
[9713.60s -> 9728.64s]  take that this projectile is floating around I have to be careful don't be a
[9728.64s -> 9750.03s]  stupid idiot I know it's a duplicator is always an instant grab but not right
[9750.03s -> 9772.64s]  now I think I'm all right without it is there another item up top that's a quest
[9772.64s -> 9786.69s]  item tracer there is I mean it's so far away there's no way I'm getting at this
[9786.69s -> 9824.64s]  run that's a new enemy I don't know hang out here damn it if you 10 minutes to
[9824.64s -> 9831.94s]  get down you have 18 minutes left that's true that's true and there's a ton of
[9831.94s -> 9836.67s]  stuff that I yeah let's go back up there's a lot of items and stuff that I
[9836.67s -> 9859.43s]  didn't get don't be walking into stuff I'll go for it let's go back up Bible or
[9859.43s -> 9894.86s]  wait for um I kind of feel like the Santa water is not great here because
[9894.86s -> 9898.30s]  it's just a vertical map I'm kind of just going into the bright and left
[9898.30s -> 9921.43s]  sides there we go hell yeah all right perfect closer and closer that's huge
[9921.43s -> 9950.63s]  okay I'm gonna wing three okay back to back oh hell yeah this is it I might
[9950.63s -> 9964.12s]  even actually get the upgrade right now for one of them whatever it is it's
[9964.12s -> 9977.54s]  close I think that's it for rune tracer right or is that it for a tracer level
[9977.54s -> 9982.73s]  six all right no I'm almost there all that that's five items I don't have to
[9982.73s -> 10005.71s]  level up I don't know where the I with the things are but I am I'm getting them

[10266.45s -> 10328.11s]  would be great just torrential downpour here we go why did I not evolve that's
[10328.11s -> 10337.84s]  the chest from the start of the game all it has to spawn after right okay I walked
[10337.84s -> 10359.97s]  by it's right here where is this there it is okay so now I got Santa
[10359.97s -> 10369.50s]  LeBora is now maxed out back up now I need the birds and that's it no rune

[10438.12s -> 10451.96s]  one yeah this rune tracer this now explodes right explodes when bouncing
[10451.96s -> 10464.65s]  and in retaliation this is gonna be ridiculous this might be the most
[10464.65s -> 10473.32s]  ridiculous display I've ever seen out of all the time I played this game I'm not
[10473.32s -> 10477.74s]  sure I've seen something like this it's kind of kind of can't see what's
[10477.74s -> 10493.23s]  happening ten ten more minutes of this something's hitting me oh my god all
[10493.23s -> 10508.94s]  right they respond be careful circular motion circular motions circular motion
[10508.94s -> 10546.84s]  circular motions we'll get up there eventually okay let's go is there a
[10546.84s -> 10564.38s]  chest yet I can't even see I don't think so the colors are blending together hold
[10564.38s -> 10577.08s]  on am I there is a chest right here this is an AI generated image all right I got
[10577.08s -> 10588.60s]  the super bird this is where it gets crazy it shoots like the yeah I got ten
[10588.60s -> 10595.28s]  minutes to go walking a story line up everything's maxed out completely maxed
[10595.28s -> 10620.21s]  out what's all that all those cards one more weapon oh my goodness you're right
[10620.21s -> 10623.57s]  what should I try to get I forgot when they combine it you get another one back
[10623.57s -> 10638.83s]  what should I try to do pentagram oh that's right you can keep leveling this
[10638.83s -> 10652.74s]  thing up we'll do that for now pentagram should I do pentagram I feel
[10652.74s -> 10662.09s]  like this is the kind of ramps up didn't I banish the pentagram at the very
[10662.13s -> 10674.57s]  beginning I could do the axe because I have the evolve right all pentagrams do
[10674.57s -> 10679.75s]  I have the thing that requires the pentagram to evolve what do you need for
[10679.75s -> 10692.44s]  it I do all right now if it shows up I'll get it I never done that before no
[10692.44s -> 10736.32s]  no pentagram oh my god I can't see any help guys hey what's happening I'm
[10736.32s -> 10756.86s]  fucking dead huh what was going on I couldn't see what was happening I have
[10756.86s -> 10767.04s]  to dodge the mortis yeah I what I could I could see the exclamation point but I
[10767.04s -> 10776.53s]  didn't I don't know where the circle is do my screen is like I can't fucking see
[10776.53s -> 10786.62s]  anything what the fuck wings are necessary on this map because what the
[10786.62s -> 10799.72s]  hell was that oh my god I was trying to talk I could see the exclamation points
[10799.72s -> 10803.78s]  I'm assuming that there's like a circle around it and I'm trying to move around
[10803.78s -> 10818.15s]  and get the fuck out of the way god damn it that was such a great run too oh
[10818.15s -> 10830.72s]  that sucks oh come on really I didn't expect them to be that many it just they
[10830.72s -> 10839.51s]  just kept happening I didn't know where to go all right that's it oh that's
[10839.51s -> 10845.88s]  suck what a shitty one to go out on I even have that I had the movement speed
[10845.88s -> 10872.64s]  shit all right one more one more now I know that happens maybe I should do here
[10872.64s -> 10880.35s]  this is actually the last one for real there's no way I'm doing another one is
[10880.35s -> 10894.57s]  that the for real the last one who do I play with should I do the same character
[10894.57s -> 10909.05s]  I feel like I said I don't know stupid reporter what does hurry mode mean all
[10909.05s -> 10919.44s]  right we're going up it's all about the area it's all about lightning ring yeah
[10919.44s -> 10931.86s]  see it's like I it's hard to tell Santa water we're doing all area area area
[10931.86s -> 10943.31s]  area I'm going up I'm so salty with that one well now I know what they do it's
[10943.31s -> 10948.39s]  like they go whoop and they land so the exclamation point happens and then it's
[10948.39s -> 10953.11s]  like two it's like a full two seconds later it's like one two there and it
[10953.11s -> 10961.05s]  shows up see that I couldn't tell yeah you couldn't see anything and I'm taking
[10961.05s -> 10965.53s]  Laurel and I know that's like a you know wow this dreamer is actually gonna take
[10965.53s -> 10968.73s]  Laurel I want it and I need it I feel like it's a huge thing to have here I
[10968.73s -> 10973.52s]  feel like it's very important especially when you don't know what you're getting
[10973.52s -> 10986.12s]  hit by I'm taking it duration or it's just let's just rush these up as fast as
[10986.12s -> 11004.48s]  I can look we're already at one minute Laurel has helped a ton yeah it really
[11004.48s -> 11008.40s]  does especially when it gets leveled up because then you can take three four
[11008.40s -> 11020.60s]  five hits in a row it's really really helpful I'm not concerned about damage
[11020.60s -> 11036.84s]  here I have lots of concentrated damage so I think I'll be fine that one was so
[11036.84s -> 11077.49s]  cool though hey stop walking in circles it can't be I where do I get the thing
[11077.49s -> 11151.07s]  that upgrades it more more again more Kylo Ren more more I can't I don't know
[11151.07s -> 11158.49s]  why I just thought of the Voldemort Homer Simpson thing again that's been
[11158.49s -> 11166.42s]  killing me I don't know why I've been thinking of it recently legendary chest
[11166.42s -> 11181.74s]  writer stick around I'm not going anywhere until I get it up just in this
[11181.74s -> 11205.89s]  guy Bible this is area right but the Bible's are huge aren't they yeah hey
[11205.89s -> 11227.51s]  you good yeah you you good legendary get the axe for area passive that's
[11227.51s -> 11265.55s]  probably a good play Oh spellbinder yep do I use a voice changer
[11265.55s -> 11279.50s]  uh when I press the button yeah a little bit of sweet a little bit that might be
[11279.50s -> 11285.00s]  the greatest thing to come out of that stream those guys was so funny they
[11285.00s -> 11291.26s]  really were that was such a great group but that was such a great group of guys
[11291.86s -> 11343.08s]  yeah yeah let's go can I get a look at me okay if I don't do it this time then
[11343.08s -> 11356.08s]  when the hell am I ever gonna do I just save so much time very nice everything I
[11356.08s -> 11359.44s]  have it that's actually good to get early because it just makes half your
[11359.44s -> 11367.23s]  shit just go up higher yep all right all right no let me the heel I've been a
[11367.23s -> 11379.10s]  little excited look the borough cell Laurel cell fate whatever it is build
[11379.10s -> 11400.56s]  up all right lightning is maxed and then I just need to get the thing and I'll be
[11400.56s -> 11418.52s]  good to go get out of here yeah give me that thank you
[11418.52s -> 11440.61s]  yep all right we're good yep I feel a little more confident in this one
[11440.61s -> 11462.21s]  mainly because of the law of the Laurel I have trouble just stubborn this on the
[11462.21s -> 11471.09s]  switch would be crazy no kind of be hard on the switch anything that small screen
[11471.09s -> 11487.26s]  the hardest it was going on be cool I gotta get down here and get this all
[11487.26s -> 11501.81s]  these crunchies all right hold on I need I have the orb I think I take the I
[11501.81s -> 11531.98s]  think I take the terms too I'm not confident now let's do the candle again
[11531.98s -> 11544.04s]  how close am I to all right I'm oh look at all these cards and stuff what's that
[11544.04s -> 11566.26s]  whatever that is I'm almost there well oh my god this this is not the run then I
[11566.26s -> 11569.06s]  don't know what the hell is gonna happen is they're just giving it to me at this
[11569.06s -> 11600.41s]  point they're just giving it to me perfect beautiful oh am I in trouble
[11600.45s -> 11610.97s]  here if I don't banish one of these I need three slots don't I or should I
[11610.97s -> 11631.24s]  just take the crown I think I need three slots I think I need the slots otherwise
[11631.24s -> 11656.58s]  I won't be left I think that's where I call all right so I don't want to touch
[11656.58s -> 11662.48s]  this do I because this is gonna give it to me shouldn't I not touch this the
[11662.48s -> 11686.24s]  bracer that's up here yeah don't touch it yet all right
[11686.24s -> 11712.17s]  Bible's up all the way area be careful cuz it's gonna spawn a bunch of shit at
[11712.17s -> 11731.44s]  me isn't it Laurel be careful yep okay third of the way there
[11731.44s -> 11768.36s]  I haven't seen that in a while what do I want for my lap should I get my last
[11768.36s -> 11802.84s]  item axe right yeah axe okay here we go first evolve Bible I need more
[11802.84s -> 11808.48s]  projectiles maybe I don't damage is not a problem right now it really isn't
[11808.48s -> 11849.87s]  they would just bond over there just walk in a circle and collect all right
[11849.87s -> 11857.11s]  here we go we're almost at the I don't want to pick this up should I get this
[11857.11s -> 11861.99s]  now cuz everyone's saying this is insane get the pentagram pentagram pentagram
[11861.99s -> 11893.04s]  but not yet late game I'm not touching that shit it's okay Laurel for the win
[11893.04s -> 11907.45s]  damage is falling off I gotta get some more stuff all right that's fine
[11907.45s -> 11942.64s]  it was halfway there all right good opportunity for a chest I'm just
[11942.64s -> 11962.47s]  collecting that's it don't worry I'm going back up awesome okay so I need to
[11962.47s -> 11965.43s]  level up like one more time right I'm gonna stick around here for a second
[11965.43s -> 11977.12s]  one of the scientists let you out of the lab oh yeah let's go um well it was a
[11977.12s -> 11983.20s]  hospital and it was when I was an infant I was born and then my mother and father
[11983.20s -> 11992.25s]  took me home oh that was about when I was another day old how long are you in
[11992.25s -> 11996.41s]  the hospital for when you're a baby uh I don't want any of these so I'm gonna
[11996.41s -> 12023.01s]  have to just do this that's not that's not axe oh this is a disaster if I do
[12023.01s -> 12029.81s]  armor I can get the ruin tracer yeah yeah and then I have that okay well
[12029.81s -> 12035.72s]  ruin tracer it is or clover but I can't evolve anything with clover can I or is
[12035.72s -> 12047.04s]  clover axe evolved garlic heals clover and cross okay what would be better
[12047.04s -> 12051.00s]  probably garlic then they I don't guard garlic I feel like would be great because
[12051.00s -> 12056.55s]  it will heal and it's like a huge area oh I banished the item for garlic I can't
[12056.55s -> 12063.93s]  do it yeah I'm doing ruin tracer I banished it yeah I'll do interest or
[12063.93s -> 12084.57s]  anything I have to do armor this axe fuck do I want ruin tracer or axe what's
[12084.57s -> 12093.16s]  better for right now I feel like it's axe because it's up and down yeah let's
[12093.16s -> 12110.45s]  do axe keep going let me just chill here for a second
[12110.45s -> 12119.79s]  there's a chest right there do I have anything maxed out okay I can do I can
[12119.79s -> 12129.84s]  get the chest there's the lightning one so this this would be really good here
[12129.84s -> 12137.73s]  it's gonna just strike all over the place in this tiny little area the orb
[12137.73s -> 12166.72s]  again I gotta keep leveling up axe again I got it I gotta rush at home I will
[12167.04s -> 12194.30s]  maybe if you're good great I think I'm alright though I think I'm alright I got
[12194.30s -> 12217.05s]  a lot of damage I'll be fine there's a chest down here I think is there I can't
[12217.05s -> 12239.60s]  even tell is there a chest down here yeah there is so I can pick this up
[12239.60s -> 12256.15s]  because I think the ones ready to go seven just yeah yeah there's that max
[12256.15s -> 12266.51s]  labora now let's go up and get the other one bingo all right let's go now just

[12275.65s -> 12306.74s]  bracer stop bracer I can get it actually probably should start stacking armor
[12306.74s -> 12330.05s]  here's the axe okay let's go yeah let's I saw I need armor if I get hit by a few
[12330.05s -> 12359.37s]  those I'm done I went by the bracer I I mean I can't see anything what's it
[12359.37s -> 12367.55s]  right there all right I got it the other ones way too far down let's go back up
[12367.83s -> 12381.88s]  use this all right this is the one I'm not gonna fuck it up there's another
[12381.88s -> 12415.67s]  item right here okay go don't fuck it up smart smart plays this chicken right

[12492.84s -> 12510.85s]  gonna last another 10 plus minutes my god dude don't do that these guys are
[12510.85s -> 12523.82s]  freezing me dude this guy's a freezing me what is that thing random Mazzo
[12523.82s -> 12533.17s]  enables the unlocking and activation of our can't Akana's what happened healing
[12533.17s -> 12541.32s]  is doubled recovering HP damages nearby enemies for the same amount healing is
[12541.32s -> 12547.27s]  doubled recovering HP damages nearby I don't have any of that I guess I'm I get
[12547.27s -> 12557.58s]  it yet I don't think I'm healing that's kind of cool though I'm moving so slow
[12558.14s -> 12564.84s]  I'm gonna get blown up I gotta kill those things are they gonna this is bad
[12564.84s -> 12583.99s]  I'm moving I gotta kill them otherwise I'm gonna get blown up okay I think
[12583.99s -> 12591.21s]  they're gone this is that this is it this is when a huge problem happened
[12591.21s -> 12606.44s]  right at like 20 minutes is there anything else on the map no happens soon
[12606.44s -> 12633.04s]  all right get ready just walking in a straight line should fix it these fucking
[12633.04s -> 12678.36s]  things just respawn I gotta stand still for a minute what hit me I'm gonna hang
[12678.36s -> 12696.04s]  out here just move back and forth I think I'm gonna be fine I don't feel so
[12696.20s -> 12743.31s]  slow I feel so slow I gotta act like duck hunt move in a pattern don't stop
[12743.31s -> 12762.28s]  moving this is where I died before don't stop moving it's not here yet I walked
[12762.28s -> 12794.08s]  into that before remember that where is it who cares about the chests it's it
[12794.08s -> 12874.90s]  pauses me and gets me out I did it I'm slow as shit right now those magicians
[12874.90s -> 12916.35s]  gotta go this health up there though that's good I'll take it you get a
[12916.35s -> 12918.83s]  chicken every time you level up potentially that's true but I have to
[12918.83s -> 12928.72s]  level up to get it so if I'm almost dead I know where one is right down here
[12928.72s -> 12971.33s]  right five minutes I got it what the fuck is that what is going on with that
