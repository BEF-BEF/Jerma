[48.97s -> 50.97s]  So why didn't you just tell me to download the mods?
[51.45s -> 56.23s]  Because this should be easier and I wanted to reduce the amount of pain that you would be caused like
[57.37s -> 60.97s]  You know
[60.97s -> 65.32s]  It should just download

[245.67s -> 249.64s]  First thing we need to build a bunch of houses because NPCs move into the houses
[249.64s -> 253.74s]  We need to gear up and prepare for our first boss fight German first boss fight
[254.18s -> 257.66s]  Yes, you don't you don't go fight the end of dragon after you download the game
[258.38s -> 260.38s]  Well, there's there's
[261.82s -> 264.86s]  Progression. It's like fighting in Dariel or the cook. Okay

[275.57s -> 279.64s]  Should I be like mining stone block sure

[302.74s -> 304.90s]  I'm like, all right, you're my husband left what?
[306.20s -> 309.36s]  Germa has left. Oh, it's really awesome
[310.12s -> 315.32s]  This is probably the best dream. I have ever had
[316.20s -> 320.16s]  I don't that
[320.32s -> 323.01s]  My look my internet's fine. Everything's fine
[323.63s -> 325.91s]  And rejoin I'm coming in right now
[326.63s -> 333.80s]  Dude, this is so scuffed, bro
[334.96s -> 339.04s]  All right
[339.04s -> 344.34s]  That was weird. Maybe it's give us was I like all tabbed for a second. Maybe that's maybe can you not all tab in this game?
[345.00s -> 347.37s]  You should be fine
[348.61s -> 352.00s]  All right, so give me some like the general
[353.44s -> 355.19s]  Control stuff
[355.19s -> 359.35s]  General control stuff is just escape to open up that and you have the one through numbers
[359.35s -> 366.67s]  Yeah to hotkey whatever you have put up there, I would recommend to have torches up there. So how do I mean how do you make torches?
[367.91s -> 372.63s]  I'll give you some I have copper coins. Okay, so just hotkey torches
[372.63s -> 377.85s]  Just put them up in like four or something or is where I put them store brothers now. Okay
[378.47s -> 382.49s]  You got some weapons, you know, put them up there. There's also an auto sort inventory
[383.07s -> 388.11s]  The bottom of your inventory the bottom right is your trash can where you delete items
[388.67s -> 392.59s]  And the box next the next to that you should have you have to enable
[394.07s -> 399.89s]  Auto trash so if you put something in that trash can every time you pick it up from now on it will automatically get trashed
[399.99s -> 405.59s]  Okay, so it's which will save your life later. Okay, so like if I let's say if I put stone block in there
[405.59s -> 410.55s]  It'll just always delete stone block. Yeah, but you don't want to delete stone blocks right now. How do I place?
[412.15s -> 414.95s]  Yeah, everything just goes into the hotkey system
[414.95s -> 417.91s]  So if you have it, you know stone blocks on for then you're placing it
[418.91s -> 423.67s]  All right. You should have we should we wait till daytime or should we keep go down and look for some like treasurer?
[424.83s -> 427.07s]  Let's chop some trees. We're gonna need a lot of wood
[433.70s -> 439.98s]  No, but you're gonna have to join the red team again turn the red team, okay, it like shows us where we are
[441.18s -> 443.18s]  Did I do it? Yeah
[444.32s -> 447.36s]  The flying demon eyes have you ever played this game like ever
[448.12s -> 452.16s]  No, no, not really. I think I've opened it like a few times randomly and then it just that's it
[455.36s -> 458.28s]  Are gonna be stir sucks Terraria Jerma Saturdays
[459.20s -> 462.16s]  Don't say that what if this is gonna take over your life
[463.12s -> 466.65s]  Okay, so also when you press escape you see on the left-hand side. You have a bunch of options
[467.41s -> 471.53s]  Crafting down here. Yeah, so wood platforms are very important
[471.53s -> 476.53s]  You hold down right-click to make a bunch. You're just turning wood into wood platforms. It shows you the rest of the shit
[476.53s -> 483.67s]  Okay, and then it's these that you place down so you can like fall through these but also do they have to be an atom
[484.17s -> 486.17s]  What can I just make them like in here?
[486.73s -> 492.07s]  They have to be connected to something or if there's a back wall you can place it on a back wall
[493.13s -> 496.65s]  So I made it really I really did not know you didn't know anything
[497.33s -> 501.65s]  I thought you had like a base. No, I mean I just I knew it was you craft
[501.65s -> 503.65s]  Well, I just made like a hundred of the other day. Oh, I

[912.72s -> 917.76s]  Here's a here's a tutorial moment. So you have your pickaxe and obviously you're gonna click these little walls, right? Yeah
[918.12s -> 921.10s]  You press alt and you see how it there's a yellow marker
[921.80s -> 922.92s]  alt
[922.92s -> 924.92s]  You should press all at one time
[925.20s -> 931.14s]  I did like yellow block. Okay, so just aim forward and like put your mouse the left side of the screen
[931.14s -> 934.26s]  Yes, and then when you hold left click, it'll auto dig you forward
[934.26s -> 937.14s]  So you don't have to individually click each block, but you still have to like walk forward
[937.86s -> 942.26s]  I'm not getting the yellow thing. You're describing press alt again. It's controlled by the way
[943.46s -> 949.82s]  Is it default? Oh, I don't know. Whoops. Sorry. Guess don't listen to me again
[951.72s -> 957.38s]  Now look we're working together why is the last two games we played together mining games
[958.38s -> 963.98s]  And you notice that watch out behind us
[966.75s -> 973.01s]  We played that deep rock galactic. Oh, no, we played
[976.49s -> 983.28s]  Well, we kind of did it you you like disappeared you looked at the painting for too long
[983.92s -> 993.26s]  All right, let's go. I got tin
[994.06s -> 1000.32s]  I'm fucking so we look at our desert. You want to do this?
[1000.40s -> 1006.20s]  This is iron there's something led same thing. All right, you just murdered that squirrel
[1008.68s -> 1015.40s]  So lead dirt was a lead stone, so what what's the what's the hierarchy here? What's what's like the the tier list for wars?
[1016.08s -> 1017.80s]  What's 10 on that?
[1017.80s -> 1021.20s]  The tier list for oars is we probably really only need lead
[1022.32s -> 1028.66s]  Here's the desert was 10 on that one 10 is 10 is non-existent. Oh
[1029.42s -> 1032.91s]  It does a thing to your screen to it, doesn't it?
[1034.89s -> 1040.68s]  Okay, Jerma, this is our new home. This is we're gonna live we're gonna live. Hey, we're already used to that
[1041.64s -> 1043.96s]  All right. Here's what here's what you're gonna do. Help me
[1044.72s -> 1048.10s]  Flatten this ground. All right, so just with the flat it out
[1049.28s -> 1055.79s]  Flatten it out because we need to build a home because in Terraria when you have homes people show up
[1057.86s -> 1059.58s]  uninvited on
[1059.62s -> 1063.14s]  Uninvited but they're very important NPCs. Should I fill this hole?
[1064.06s -> 1069.62s]  Sure, you know, just make it look nice, you know users some of your creativity. Okay
[1071.59s -> 1073.59s]  It's dirt right was it sand
[1076.95s -> 1080.95s]  Sand there's a giant hornet over here. I kind of that scared the shit out of me. Help me
[1085.39s -> 1093.86s]  Whoa, all right, that's cool. What now it's all dirty. We have to move somewhere
[1099.22s -> 1102.78s]  Okay goes away, how are you throwing these knives that's so cool
[1107.07s -> 1109.07s]  Let me get dirt in here
[1109.63s -> 1122.39s]  So, how do you just this is not dirt? How do I take it back? I put it back in my inventory
[1124.45s -> 1127.25s]  You should auto be. Oh, yeah, just delete it again
[1128.05s -> 1137.70s]  Okay, sand block sand block sand block. All right. So now I can I just fill this
[1138.38s -> 1140.38s]  How far how big do you want the house?
[1141.39s -> 1143.56s]  way too big
[1144.00s -> 1146.44s]  We're eventually we're going to be like a metropolis
[1147.56s -> 1148.64s]  What?
[1148.64s -> 1157.43s]  It's gonna be big. It's gotta be big German. Yeah, this is the most boring bar to Terraria and you need to get it done quick
[1157.97s -> 1161.24s]  So from you to me, that's not big enough
[1163.53s -> 1169.77s]  It'll do for now. It's like in real life. If this was scaled. This would be like a this would be like a 2500 square foot house
[1170.05s -> 1172.05s]  It's not big enough
[1172.73s -> 1174.37s]  For now

[1970.88s -> 1975.76s]  Here i'm missing i'm making these platforms so you can remove that that extra accidental ceiling
[1976.88s -> 1981.92s]  What do you mean one up here? You need to pickaxe that ceiling that shouldn't be that way pickaxe of the ceiling
[1983.04s -> 1988.64s]  Yeah, remove the wood ceiling. That's there. You understand take out you want me to get rid of like this the ceiling

[1994.88s -> 1997.92s]  This needs to look perfect. Otherwise, no one's gonna want to live here
[1999.28s -> 2002.35s]  Now these platforms could be a little better
[2003.15s -> 2007.55s]  I'm not gonna say anything about what the platforms are being removed. They're just so you can stand on them jerma
[2007.71s -> 2010.35s]  It's like a ladder you ever use a ladder before you short
[2010.83s -> 2014.00s]  Oh
[2014.00s -> 2016.00s]  You can say you can say fuck it all

[2040.19s -> 2042.46s]  What is that stereo?
[2042.46s -> 2044.46s]  Holy shit, are you really?
[2050.59s -> 2053.95s]  Unbelievable, you want me to get rid of this one too again. What are you gonna die again?
[2056.94s -> 2061.98s]  The mod adds these early game robbers with like pistols that just like instant kill you
[2062.94s -> 2067.42s]  Put on head or pre-recorded. All right, where's the shoe? Can I put a shoe over head in the game?
[2068.75s -> 2070.72s]  Am I safe in here?
[2070.72s -> 2075.28s]  Yes, you're safe jerma. Just don't open the door. But I like it's it's like don't press the button and i'm about to
[2075.92s -> 2098.07s]  Don't press i'm gonna go talk to mysterio. All right, i'll finish this. I would not want to live here. Go talk to mysterio
[2104.83s -> 2106.51s]  Uh, we need more walls
[2106.51s -> 2112.64s]  So we said mine straight. Yeah, can I like just mine straight down?
[2113.52s -> 2115.52s]  And have like a little basement thing
[2116.70s -> 2120.46s]  Um, there's something I want you to do before we do that then then here
[2120.54s -> 2123.02s]  This is very important before I can set you free. Sure
[2125.50s -> 2127.74s]  Can you right click that does it say spawn point set?
[2128.30s -> 2129.98s]  No
[2129.98s -> 2132.38s]  Uh, if I right click it, it does nothing now
[2133.50s -> 2134.86s]  spawn point set
[2134.86s -> 2135.90s]  Okay
[2135.90s -> 2137.90s]  Now you can dig straight down
[2138.62s -> 2140.14s]  dig straight down
[2141.74s -> 2149.10s]  Is that smart though, or is that just gonna be like a comedy moment? Um, what I would actually recommend doing is once night ends
[2149.90s -> 2152.46s]  You know how you can press m and it opens the map. Yeah
[2153.34s -> 2156.38s]  There are some tunnels that go down not this desert one. Don't do this one
[2157.26s -> 2162.54s]  But like we pass some you can start exploring those caves and if you find chests chests have uh,
[2163.02s -> 2165.02s]  special items in them
[2165.66s -> 2167.58s]  Um what I will also give to you
[2167.74s -> 2171.98s]  Can you sell stuff in this game or should I just start trying like what what should I not be holding on to?
[2173.47s -> 2176.99s]  Uh, like random flowers you've picked up are probably useless
[2177.71s -> 2179.87s]  How do I sell them? Just do it just trashing them sell
[2180.91s -> 2184.32s]  Uh, we need npcs to show up before we can sell things
[2185.28s -> 2189.76s]  Why is clicking this just making it brighter?
[2191.07s -> 2196.06s]  Oh, never mind
[2196.06s -> 2198.06s]  Uh, I have a wrath element
[2200.58s -> 2203.86s]  Um, should I be holding how do I hold blood in my pockets?
[2204.42s -> 2208.98s]  Anything that you're not sure that you need just dump in there just dump all your garbage in that box
[2209.22s -> 2211.22s]  Okay, is there a way to dump all?
[2211.62s -> 2213.62s]  No
[2214.10s -> 2217.50s]  Oh well
[2217.50s -> 2219.34s]  Gotta keep that tin
[2219.34s -> 2220.94s]  Is there like a
[2220.94s -> 2223.34s]  Shift click or something to make it so it goes do I don't click and drag?
[2225.25s -> 2226.69s]  Okay, there we go
[2226.69s -> 2234.53s]  blood droplets
[2234.53s -> 2237.41s]  Victory shard. Yeah, you're gonna have to sort through this
[2238.13s -> 2250.58s]  I've never played this really before but I know
[2251.62s -> 2255.06s]  For a fact that these seashells should not be put in here
[2255.62s -> 2260.02s]  Throw them in there deposit all
[2260.88s -> 2262.88s]  I thought wait, what do you mean deposit all?
[2265.14s -> 2267.54s]  You just told me I couldn't do deposit all everyone's screaming. Oh

[2607.50s -> 2611.71s]  So why are we going this far away?
[2611.71s -> 2615.09s]  Uh, I'm personally personally i'm looking for corruption
[2618.08s -> 2623.12s]  Which is a a biome that we're not currently in give me your mouse for a minute. I need to do something
[2624.56s -> 2627.36s]  Are they hostile a boar's hostile is now
[2631.73s -> 2636.88s]  Cool, all right, they drop bacon, which is good bacon
[2639.20s -> 2641.20s]  Yeah, there's one bacon
[2641.73s -> 2644.23s]  So what's the first boss?
[2644.23s -> 2646.23s]  Well, the first one I want to fight is
[2646.79s -> 2648.71s]  a giant worm
[2648.71s -> 2651.43s]  In the desert, which is why we built the desert top epic
[2652.63s -> 2657.11s]  I'll see like down here this chest. Yeah, this is what life is all about in terraria, dude
[2660.69s -> 2662.69s]  It had like garbage in it here, uh
[2663.33s -> 2667.16s]  I'm gonna give you a bunch of rope
[2667.16s -> 2670.60s]  What's your what's your what's your opinion on bacon when I say the word bacon? What do you think of?
[2671.62s -> 2674.66s]  Uh, I think of slices of bacon take those potions that are in there
[2675.62s -> 2689.75s]  And there's that rope. All right, so I technically can just go like
[2695.03s -> 2700.29s]  Yeah, that's fun what are these little tanks? All right
[2701.09s -> 2703.09s]  Uh, they're little tanks

[2707.60s -> 2710.00s]  Oh, dude food epic, bro
[2711.04s -> 2714.16s]  I know right. I yeah, that's a delayed bacon reaction
[2714.88s -> 2724.58s]  Yeah, okay. This direction sucks
[2724.58s -> 2726.58s]  It's just desert
[2727.62s -> 2729.86s]  Desert and yungle
[2730.66s -> 2733.09s]  Is that a bad thing?
[2733.09s -> 2734.29s]  Yeah
[2734.29s -> 2736.29s]  Looking for corruption, bro
[2738.90s -> 2740.90s]  Is it poisonous or something?
[2741.38s -> 2742.66s]  No
[2742.66s -> 2749.12s]  Oh, that's a cool particle there
[2749.62s -> 2761.92s]  What the fuck?
[2761.92s -> 2764.93s]  Wait, um, should I not go down there?
[2764.93s -> 2767.41s]  You can do it. I believe you need to heal
[2768.37s -> 2774.69s]  I'm good
[2774.69s -> 2780.90s]  There's a treasure chest over here. Oh wow treasure chest holly
[2781.62s -> 2784.45s]  Well, it's a festive holly
[2784.45s -> 2793.20s]  This is cool
[2793.20s -> 2794.80s]  Not the desert anymore
[2794.80s -> 2800.39s]  So you I don't think you ever said the person that you wanted to fight
[2801.03s -> 2805.09s]  The person we want to fight the first boss big giant desert worm
[2805.89s -> 2815.99s]  It's a shot like a roman candle. That's all I did
[2818.08s -> 2826.13s]  People are saying what about the slime man? What about it?
[2827.81s -> 2829.81s]  Is that the first boss?
[2830.85s -> 2834.76s]  How do I get like a little buddy?
[2837.80s -> 2839.72s]  How do I heal?
[2839.72s -> 2842.28s]  H if you have a potion I thought I did
[2843.40s -> 2845.00s]  I'll give you some
[2845.00s -> 2848.31s]  I guess not
[2848.31s -> 2851.51s]  Oh, no, I do I do from knocking down trees eat an apple
[2852.39s -> 2859.24s]  Oh, how do I eat them just by clicking on them use? Yeah, and we use everything only one
[2859.96s -> 2861.88s]  Oh only one
[2861.88s -> 2867.12s]  I did have a healing potion. Why was it not working?
[2867.76s -> 2870.80s]  Uh, there's a healing cooldown. That's pretty long
[2872.00s -> 2875.60s]  That shows if your inventory is minimized. There's a healing sickness like
[2876.46s -> 2878.46s]  40 seconds something cool down
[2878.96s -> 2880.96s]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Well fed I see
[2882.32s -> 2884.32s]  And a well thought is different
[2885.28s -> 2893.76s]  I gotta be careful here these little owls. What the hell that your little guy keeps hitting these owls
[2894.16s -> 2896.16s]  And then they start to fucking attack me
[2897.04s -> 2899.04s]  They're always attacking they are
[2899.52s -> 2900.96s]  Yeah
[2900.96s -> 2907.11s]  Don't blame me
[2907.19s -> 2909.19s]  Okay, is it like bees can they go in water?
[2910.37s -> 2912.37s]  Um, most things actually can't
[2913.01s -> 2914.53s]  No, this thing can't
[2914.53s -> 2923.65s]  Where if there's no corruption this direction, I'm if you're false
[2924.61s -> 2927.17s]  How would it be my fault? What do you do with the money the copper?
[2929.06s -> 2934.02s]  Uh, you can buy things from the npcs in the house as we made. I mean the present is remade
[2934.98s -> 2938.00s]  Is it
[2938.00s -> 2940.00s]  Is this a slime present?
[2942.23s -> 2944.42s]  Why is there something?
[2944.42s -> 2946.58s]  They're very generous. Oh, okay. I get it
[2947.54s -> 2952.50s]  Currency can be exchanged for goods and services
[2953.46s -> 2956.80s]  Oh
[2956.80s -> 2965.64s]  It's tin very helpful
[2965.96s -> 2968.44s]  We went really really really far away
[2969.08s -> 2970.76s]  Yeah, we did
[2970.76s -> 2972.76s]  Are we gonna have to make a new house?
[2973.16s -> 2976.96s]  Oh, I can't even I don't even know where our house is
[2978.31s -> 2980.31s]  There's like nothing in this direction
[2980.87s -> 2987.73s]  Is it you're looking for something very very very specific?
[2988.37s -> 2990.37s]  It's usually like right next to you
[2991.41s -> 2997.09s]  Here, you know what you have, uh the blue potion in your indoor recall potion
[2998.69s -> 2999.97s]  Yes
[2999.97s -> 3002.37s]  Yeah, if you use that it will take you to the bed
[3003.25s -> 3005.25s]  Oh, that's all right. That's cool
[3009.72s -> 3011.72s]  I can actually drown in this
[3011.88s -> 3012.92s]  Yeah

[3017.35s -> 3025.56s]  It's something that should is it how do I make like a cool staff?
[3027.11s -> 3029.11s]  a cool staff that's
[3030.60s -> 3033.16s]  The one you have will be decent for a while. Okay
[3034.04s -> 3038.66s]  For you for you to get a cool one. We're gonna need to kill a boss
[3039.54s -> 3041.40s]  Okay

[3051.96s -> 3053.96s]  Should I be?
[3054.12s -> 3057.48s]  Yeah, i'm still going in this direction and it's I don't think it's gonna be this way
[3058.28s -> 3063.54s]  Okay, so you can try and go down the caves and find chests
[3064.18s -> 3066.50s]  Like an eggnog
[3066.50s -> 3076.28s]  All right, i'm going back

[3155.03s -> 3158.87s]  My iron anvil
[3158.95s -> 3160.95s]  Don't ever sell ore or gel
[3163.22s -> 3166.68s]  Did I?

[3251.81s -> 3254.24s]  moon glow is
[3254.32s -> 3259.52s]  Normally used to make potions, but it's not important because we have a potion npc so I wouldn't bother. Okay
[3260.56s -> 3263.73s]  What is gel?
[3263.73s -> 3265.73s]  Gel is the drop from

[3283.72s -> 3288.84s]  Anything that's like plant-based or seed-based is going to be a potion crafting and does not matter

[3351.48s -> 3354.72s]  what
[3354.72s -> 3357.20s]  I just like threw everything in there. So I put my bomb back
[3360.36s -> 3363.32s]  Everything that I don't know what it's used for is just going in this chest
[3363.96s -> 3367.32s]  Okay, that's how you should do it. I'll make a second chest because we'll probably need more
[3369.28s -> 3371.28s]  Before we can get the super chest
[3372.14s -> 3374.24s]  potions apple torch
[3376.87s -> 3379.91s]  Annoying how does it how does a copper axe annoying?
[3380.79s -> 3387.16s]  I don't know dude candy cane. Well, I want that out just in case I need it. No, what's my thinking?
[3388.20s -> 3390.04s]  Don't use those doesn't mind
[3390.04s -> 3394.39s]  All right wand of sparking or
[3394.71s -> 3396.71s]  Superior amethyst staff 15
[3397.27s -> 3399.27s]  13 4% crit
[3400.05s -> 3401.41s]  I mean, okay
[3401.41s -> 3402.93s]  blue good
[3402.93s -> 3408.85s]  Green great and then what like purple legendary or something hot? What's the item? Yeah, it's just like there's random names
[3408.85s -> 3411.09s]  There's like murderous godly legendary
[3412.98s -> 3419.06s]  They're all like the same basic stats still as long as it's not negative. It's fine. So green is better than blue
[3420.87s -> 3423.97s]  I actually don't know the order
[3423.97s -> 3425.97s]  I'm just gonna prefixes. Okay
[3431.75s -> 3433.75s]  All right, so um
[3434.39s -> 3439.03s]  Are we gonna stick around in here? We're gonna adventure again or what do you want to do? Um, hold on
[3439.03s -> 3443.19s]  I'm grabbing these stars and then we're gonna go to the right because it's gonna help speed things up a lot if we can
[3443.19s -> 3446.87s]  Find that the corruption was looking for it's probably just right up where we started
[3447.75s -> 3450.76s]  Make sure I get all my shit ready
[3451.32s -> 3454.64s]  Okay, I got i'm all right
[3454.72s -> 3459.84s]  Purple is the best
[3459.84s -> 3463.24s]  All right sick. All right, let's go
[3467.80s -> 3469.72s]  Uh, here's mana
[3469.72s -> 3476.36s]  Oh now I have three mana stars
[3478.56s -> 3485.22s]  Now you don't think this is too dark don't you think we should have like a path lit up maybe one day
[3487.68s -> 3489.28s]  I can do a flare
[3489.28s -> 3493.91s]  All right zombie ahead
[3493.91s -> 3495.91s]  Just I want to make sure you can see him
[3496.55s -> 3501.67s]  I can see clearly. What is that weapon that you're using right now? You have like a big like claw
[3502.79s -> 3517.11s]  You have torches in your hot bar. Yeah, I know but he got mad at me when I did this
[3518.07s -> 3522.23s]  I'm sure you can you can do that all you want. I'm not gonna get mad
[3523.19s -> 3525.19s]  You said torrent
[3529.27s -> 3534.55s]  I meant like torches on the ground and the base were annoying because you the ground on the base gets filled up by a whole bunch
[3534.55s -> 3540.24s]  of nonsense
[3545.97s -> 3556.36s]  I can make some wood armor. Do you have any armor on a tiny bit? What's that?
[3556.92s -> 3559.67s]  fallen star
[3559.67s -> 3561.67s]  That's it. That's what you need three of
[3561.91s -> 3563.46s]  Really?
[3563.46s -> 3565.86s]  Yeah, and after I have three of these I can what?
[3566.58s -> 3568.58s]  Combine them into the mana crystal. Oh
[3570.02s -> 3573.41s]  Somebody's house. Oh
[3574.21s -> 3578.05s]  Wait, this is where you built this. This is where we started. Oh, okay
[3578.85s -> 3582.13s]  Why don't we just use this place? That place is way better than yours
[3584.61s -> 3585.89s]  You think it is
[3585.89s -> 3591.25s]  But you're wrong, oh because we're not that one doesn't have people trapped inside of walls to make sure they stay there
[3591.97s -> 3596.13s]  Yeah, so what does this mean stir? I've got snapped in half by a demon eye
[3596.77s -> 3598.77s]  That's where we died
[3609.75s -> 3617.25s]  Track i'm gonna track them lead the target star got snapped
[3623.64s -> 3631.72s]  Look at these air shots
[3631.72s -> 3633.72s]  So i'm assuming we're probably gonna do a thing
[3634.60s -> 3638.60s]  Where we just both stand above cave and drop bombs down the cave
[3639.48s -> 3644.56s]  eventually
[3644.56s -> 3647.84s]  That is the plan or we get the super bomb that auto drills to hell
[3649.01s -> 3651.01s]  Auto drills to hell
[3655.04s -> 3659.28s]  Yeah, if I alt click an item it locks them so I don't auto deposit them. That's good to know. Oh, yeah
[3659.36s -> 3661.20s]  Yeah, yeah, that's important
[3661.20s -> 3668.68s]  So why don't we just like start digging down and maneuvering?
[3669.57s -> 3671.89s]  Why are we just walking left and right?
[3672.69s -> 3675.03s]  there's
[3675.03s -> 3680.79s]  Okay, we've been playing for an hour and all we've done is walk very far left and right. It's all it's all you've done
[3681.75s -> 3684.63s]  I didn't even have to make noise for that one
[3686.87s -> 3689.46s]  All right, somebody's house
[3689.46s -> 3692.98s]  This is one of the mods. It's a boss, but only in hard mode
[3693.86s -> 3695.86s]  But it has a chest up here
[3695.86s -> 3701.06s]  Listen, I had money
[3701.06s -> 3704.50s]  and nothing else
[3704.50s -> 3706.74s]  Nothing else. Okay. This is what I was looking for
[3707.78s -> 3709.78s]  Something got in here. How did this get in here?
[3710.50s -> 3712.50s]  It's not placing torches. I died
[3717.78s -> 3719.54s]  I I can't go down
[3719.54s -> 3722.55s]  Why did you bring me in this? That snowman's gonna fuck you up, dude
[3724.04s -> 3726.04s]  Remember to heal h h h
[3726.20s -> 3731.84s]  What is this?
[3731.84s -> 3733.52s]  What did you bring us?
[3733.52s -> 3740.84s]  Don't shoot
[3740.84s -> 3742.84s]  Okay, you need to keep these off of me
[3743.92s -> 3748.16s]  We need to fight these we need to fight while we descend down into the corruption
[3749.20s -> 3750.96s]  bomb the shadow orbs
[3750.96s -> 3755.28s]  This is giving too many things. This is not like the first zone in world of warcraft
[3756.80s -> 3758.80s]  i'm still right now on
[3759.20s -> 3760.82s]  kill the
[3760.82s -> 3762.10s]  boars
[3762.10s -> 3766.26s]  And you're telling me we're gonna bomb through the shaft. We're gonna run through this way. You got five seconds
[3766.90s -> 3768.90s]  Pick up the crystal
[3769.06s -> 3774.47s]  It's a very simple drama. We just have to descend the shaft
[3775.03s -> 3783.03s]  I have no torches. No
[3783.03s -> 3785.19s]  I like this music send the shaft kill the snowman
[3787.92s -> 3789.92s]  All right, if you can do the entire
[3790.56s -> 3795.28s]  Do you want to build a snowman song right now? And I mean without even looking it up and just going I will give you
[3795.68s -> 3797.52s]  a dollar
[3797.52s -> 3800.40s]  No, I would give you a dollar and store credit to game stop
[3801.20s -> 3803.84s]  Holy shit, I thought you just killed yourself. I thought I did too
[3807.03s -> 3808.71s]  Dude
[3808.71s -> 3811.75s]  You're the one who doesn't know what they're doing and you're going faster than me
[3813.91s -> 3815.67s]  I'm just trying to get back up
[3815.67s -> 3819.19s]  Give me the apples
[3819.19s -> 3825.60s]  All right. I'm good. Remember one apple right right right right right right one apple
[3830.32s -> 3839.80s]  You brought me into the first like wow dungeon before I even know what my character's rotation is
[3841.38s -> 3847.94s]  Your rotation is shoot staff i'm the person that gets screamed at in the dead minds because I don't know how to heal somebody
[3849.22s -> 3855.56s]  I'm the person in the dead minds that's playing a healer. That is auto attack right clicking on people
[3857.64s -> 3859.64s]  And cannot figure out why all right, let's go
[3872.34s -> 3878.23s]  It's too fast, okay, see those orbs under the ground are you zoomed out enough that you can see them?
[3878.87s -> 3880.87s]  um, no, yes
[3881.49s -> 3885.25s]  I can see the pearls. That's what we're here for. We're here for those pearls. I need the bomb
[3886.21s -> 3888.77s]  Should I just should I just kill the enemies?
[3890.05s -> 3896.36s]  Yeah
[3896.36s -> 3899.68s]  Don't fall in that hole. I'm gonna try not to
[3904.40s -> 3906.48s]  How do you just how do you throw bombs?
[3907.94s -> 3911.38s]  In your in your spot holding dude, you're gonna don't die. Don't die
[3912.26s -> 3914.26s]  That worm's coming up again
[3917.51s -> 3924.16s]  Okay, I hardly knew you
[3928.55s -> 3930.55s]  I was gonna hang out in the house
[3931.57s -> 3936.05s]  Can I just lock myself in here? Yeah, I'll be back, honey
[3937.01s -> 3939.17s]  Yeah, give me my give me some wood here
[3939.97s -> 3942.93s]  I'm just gonna block myself in here. I'm a i'm the fifth npc
[3945.57s -> 3948.84s]  All right, i'm gonna make some armor
[3948.92s -> 3951.16s]  Oh, man, I forgot you can be annoying in this game
[3953.06s -> 3956.50s]  You're like the moment, you know that you can be a bard and play music and enemies you
[3957.75s -> 3959.91s]  No, that's i'm i'm that's not gonna happen. All right, let me go
[3960.87s -> 3968.82s]  So arcane dust no, no, no, I need to pull some materials up wood. Can I just make wooden armor stone armor?
[3969.94s -> 3974.90s]  Uh, you should be able to make wood armor. There's a bunch of cactus around make cactus armor cactus armor
[3975.62s -> 3978.63s]  Yeah
[3978.63s -> 3980.63s]  How much does it take to make one?
[3980.79s -> 3982.79s]  I don't know. We'll find out
[3984.23s -> 3989.59s]  But also in terraria when you have a full set like if you have a helmet armor and leggings of uh cactus
[3989.67s -> 3991.67s]  Then you get an extra bonus
[3991.67s -> 3993.11s]  Okay
[3993.11s -> 3995.11s]  cactus
[3998.07s -> 4000.47s]  I had to do that. Hold on. Where does this go?
[4003.44s -> 4007.17s]  All right, that's better. How many do I need? Oh what?
[4008.16s -> 4012.13s]  When I was only two
[4012.13s -> 4013.33s]  Why is it?
[4013.33s -> 4015.81s]  Why is there a uh metal gear rising?
[4017.32s -> 4020.84s]  Like bar down here how well I did on the level?
[4021.56s -> 4022.92s]  No reason
[4022.92s -> 4026.00s]  Are you fighting a boss right now?
[4026.00s -> 4029.01s]  No, I ran
[4029.01s -> 4031.19s]  Okay cactus lamp
[4038.00s -> 4040.00s]  Cactus, how do I make cactus armor?
[4042.29s -> 4044.29s]  Uh stand near the anvil
[4045.65s -> 4048.29s]  And you have enough of it and it'll show the option when you press escape
[4049.41s -> 4055.81s]  You bombed a second. What it's supposed to be three to some of them
[4056.69s -> 4061.67s]  I only thought I did the two
[4061.67s -> 4063.67s]  There were two right there. Okay, whatever
[4064.07s -> 4066.07s]  I didn't pick anything up from it. Did I?
[4066.47s -> 4071.70s]  How the fuck I need my axe
[4072.42s -> 4075.30s]  I think I have to go back
[4075.94s -> 4081.76s]  Where's my pickaxe? There it is
[4082.80s -> 4088.13s]  Let's get
[4088.13s -> 4097.94s]  Cactus
[4097.94s -> 4101.06s]  You can't even cut cacti with a sword zero out of ten
[4107.73s -> 4112.13s]  You can pickaxe the sand underneath the cactus and then the whole cactus goes away. Oh
[4113.81s -> 4117.41s]  Do you get more for doing it like this or does it not matter at all the same?
[4118.96s -> 4121.68s]  Oh hold shift to auto select the correct tool
[4122.56s -> 4125.27s]  Well, that's the best fucking advice. I've heard all day
[4126.31s -> 4128.31s]  I didn't know you could do that
[4128.31s -> 4131.41s]  Holy shit, that's that's that's amazing
[4134.13s -> 4135.25s]  Wow
[4135.25s -> 4138.47s]  um
[4138.47s -> 4141.51s]  That's the best. Yeah, that works wonders
[4142.23s -> 4144.40s]  Like I had 32 copper
[4144.64s -> 4154.50s]  Hold control while mining to make it easier
[4156.20s -> 4159.48s]  Gotta hold shift gotta hold control gotta what else do I gotta do?
[4161.19s -> 4164.24s]  Hold me in your arm. I think I have enough
[4174.10s -> 4178.58s]  I remember watching you play this before a long long long time ago
[4180.04s -> 4182.04s]  and eventually you got to a point where
[4182.52s -> 4185.16s]  There was so much going on on the screen at the same time
[4185.72s -> 4188.36s]  Yeah, it turns into a bullet hell. Yeah, it was just
[4189.48s -> 4191.48s]  This fire everywhere. You would just like
[4193.08s -> 4195.08s]  Like a machine gun out of your hands
[4195.08s -> 4200.69s]  Yep. Right now. This is our humble beginnings
[4202.71s -> 4205.62s]  but you turn into like uh
[4205.62s -> 4210.26s]  All right a jojo character you guys like jojo, right? That's all you're talking about. It's like underwear cactus bikini
[4213.40s -> 4218.90s]  Ooh, I have a good spell for you. And now we're ready to slam a boss cactus leggings
[4219.86s -> 4221.83s]  cool
[4221.91s -> 4223.91s]  Cactus breastplate
[4223.91s -> 4226.39s]  cactus helmet
[4226.39s -> 4230.31s]  So is it boots or is it just legs head and uh breastplate?
[4231.51s -> 4234.55s]  Legs head breastplate. Yeah, and is there a certain place I have to put this?
[4235.88s -> 4242.52s]  Uh, if you right click it it goes to the right side of your screen. There's an inventory over there like what you're wearing equipment
[4244.00s -> 4246.00s]  If you right click it'll auto equip
[4246.90s -> 4248.50s]  Oh, I see. Okay
[4248.50s -> 4252.28s]  Why does this guy keep talking to me?
[4254.34s -> 4255.70s]  Trying to get past the
[4256.63s -> 4258.63s]  All right, so I have uh, i'm i'm
[4258.87s -> 4260.87s]  I currently am
[4261.27s -> 4263.27s]  Uh aquaman
[4275.27s -> 4276.79s]  Gingerbread cookie
[4276.79s -> 4278.58s]  mistletoe
[4278.58s -> 4279.86s]  Oh
[4279.86s -> 4283.22s]  Modern improvement to all stats for 30 minutes. Do you want this?
[4285.35s -> 4288.07s]  Uh, I feel like this is a u item
[4289.86s -> 4292.98s]  What are you? Hey, what is what have you been doing?
[4294.24s -> 4296.24s]  Don't tell what the fuck are you doing?
[4297.04s -> 4301.32s]  What are you doing?
[4301.32s -> 4306.72s]  That was my lamp
[4306.72s -> 4308.72s]  Oh my god, our beds are right next to each other
[4311.08s -> 4313.08s]  Well, no, they're not our heads are
[4313.97s -> 4315.01s]  All right
[4315.01s -> 4317.01s]  Are we ready to fight this boss?
[4317.17s -> 4321.49s]  Um, there's a couple things we need hold on. Let me look up the other one rotten. All right
[4321.49s -> 4323.49s]  I need to put some stuff away
[4324.96s -> 4327.84s]  Wait, I gotta make the don't deposit this thing, right?
[4329.08s -> 4331.08s]  Can you alt click? What is it?
[4336.60s -> 4338.60s]  And my bombs? Yeah, does that work?
[4340.48s -> 4344.36s]  Kind of you look very good. All right
[4344.92s -> 4348.63s]  You can hover over your armor to see the set bonus
[4349.03s -> 4351.03s]  Plus one defense. Oh, that's cool
[4354.05s -> 4356.61s]  Okay, we need to wait for night. I need to get one of those stars
[4357.49s -> 4360.85s]  Also, we need to kill a storm antlion, which is going to be in this
[4361.73s -> 4364.53s]  Antlion, but it's blue. It's very different than other animals
[4365.33s -> 4367.41s]  This is way more than I thought this game was
[4368.45s -> 4370.45s]  This game has a lot
[4371.41s -> 4372.85s]  and like I said
[4372.85s -> 4378.13s]  It turns into a bullet hole
[4378.13s -> 4378.45s]  All right
[4378.45s -> 4380.29s]  So what i'm going to do after I do this fun
[4380.29s -> 4385.01s]  We do this fun little tutorial session where we hang out and we fight a few bosses and we play for a while
[4386.29s -> 4389.81s]  Uh, i'm gonna like look up those wikipedia articles of this game
[4392.21s -> 4396.29s]  And then determine after reading the wiki pages if it's like yeah, i'm gonna do this long term
[4398.79s -> 4402.39s]  We'll get well like after we start killing the first few things here. We're gonna pick up
[4403.03s -> 4405.03s]  The pace really quickly in a moment
[4405.59s -> 4413.19s]  What are you doing? I'm broken
[4417.86s -> 4419.86s]  Oh, I have to give you the thing
[4419.94s -> 4421.94s]  thing, uh
[4422.02s -> 4424.02s]  That i'm dropping it right here
[4424.26s -> 4426.26s]  Is that in vile thorn?
[4427.08s -> 4429.00s]  I pick it up again
[4429.00s -> 4431.88s]  So what is this? That is that is your new wand

[5523.57s -> 5538.54s]  I got him nice. Why don't I spawn all the way back here?
[5542.56s -> 5547.52s]  Oh, that's it's some I don't know if it's a random bug that it spawns you there sometimes or you
[5547.74s -> 5550.88s]  Accidentally right click your bed and it unsets your spawn point
[5551.04s -> 5552.72s]  Is it very annoying?
[5552.72s -> 5554.16s]  You might have
[5554.16s -> 5557.74s]  So I I think we need to put our beds
[5558.32s -> 5562.00s]  Somewhere else. Oh, so we don't accidentally right click them people saying I blew up the bed
[5563.36s -> 5564.40s]  You
[5564.40s -> 5566.40s]  I don't think you did. Did I not?
[5567.98s -> 5570.78s]  Yeah, no, the bed's still there. I think he just accidentally right clicked it
[5571.50s -> 5576.30s]  The wall was damaged so that room no longer counts for a bed to work. Oh, that's actually true
[5576.54s -> 5586.90s]  Uh guys do you make the um, I have cthulhu summon at a demon altar or can you do it in an anvil?
[5589.78s -> 5593.06s]  Uh guys, do you know how to play the game because I don't
[5594.18s -> 5597.25s]  Why don't I have a door in my inventory?
[5597.41s -> 5602.98s]  Yeah, i'm gonna make jerma jealous
[5603.78s -> 5605.78s]  He wants to ride the slime
[5606.18s -> 5608.48s]  How do I put the door down?
[5608.48s -> 5610.48s]  Uh, there's no wall
[5613.04s -> 5618.67s]  There you go, okay, so now we can right click this spawn point set
[5619.71s -> 5623.49s]  Oh, you trapped him. Okay
[5627.90s -> 5629.90s]  all right, so
[5630.54s -> 5633.18s]  You're doing a lot of playing and not a whole lot of describing
[5634.12s -> 5638.54s]  Describing so we just killed two bosses. We just killed that guy. He got me this
[5639.18s -> 5640.86s]  He got you that
[5640.86s -> 5642.86s]  Yeah, what is he getting?
[5643.10s -> 5647.18s]  What did he get you? I want to he got me my hidden blade technique throwing knife technique
[5649.44s -> 5652.96s]  Cool, you're getting a lot of fun stuff. Um, when do I get the super mario shoe?
[5653.20s -> 5658.24s]  Um, their percentage chance drops and he didn't really drop any mage shit, so you didn't really get anything
[5663.31s -> 5666.83s]  Sorry, dude. All right. Bye. So let's go
[5667.87s -> 5669.98s]  i'm ready
[5669.98s -> 5672.51s]  um
[5672.51s -> 5674.51s]  We could probably
[5675.41s -> 5677.41s]  Kill the eater of worlds
[5677.41s -> 5679.41s]  the eater of worlds
[5679.49s -> 5681.49s]  Yeah, and then we'll start getting
[5682.38s -> 5687.58s]  We'll start getting
[5687.58s -> 5693.74s]  Games with stir. He takes all the drops and leaves you 10 miles behind. There's actually there are clearly no drops for him
[5701.58s -> 5707.26s]  I didn't yeah, I didn't say anything. I know it's true. It's fine
[5709.90s -> 5714.30s]  Uh, i'm okay with that. I need to go see down here if dynamite
[5715.18s -> 5717.66s]  Destroys fossil. I don't think it does
[5718.70s -> 5721.18s]  I'm gonna go i'm gonna go over here. I'm gonna go over here
[5722.14s -> 5732.18s]  I'm gonna just go this way. Wait, are we leaving our friends vulnerable doors open? It does not um
[5733.06s -> 5739.36s]  They're a little vulnerable. All right, I closed the doors. I'm you know, i'm gonna go down. I'm gonna go down like a little cave
[5739.44s -> 5741.60s]  There's another boss we can fight right now
[5742.88s -> 5749.20s]  Uh, I think I think I can do it right now. Oh my god, can you fucking refill this sand? Can you show some responsibility?
[5749.76s -> 5752.46s]  What's sand?
[5752.54s -> 5758.30s]  The hole you made refill it with sand is it's keeping it keeps up the enemies but it's keeping me out too
[5758.62s -> 5760.86s]  How do I open this door?
[5760.86s -> 5764.46s]  Oh, you can't open it inward now because I placed the furnace there. Oh
[5765.90s -> 5771.74s]  We're running out of space. All right, i'll fix it. I'll fix the sand just hold on. Yeah, and I can summon a boss
[5772.38s -> 5774.14s]  Let me fix the sand first
[5774.14s -> 5776.54s]  We have to do it before tonight time. Let's do it now
[5778.46s -> 5780.46s]  And then you fix the sand
[5784.32s -> 5786.32s]  The grand thunderbird has awoken
[5787.20s -> 5789.36s]  He'll like charge at you. Do you need to jump over him?
[5790.56s -> 5795.01s]  No
[5795.01s -> 5798.93s]  Oh, i'm out of musket. Oh, he's like glitching out. What the fuck
[5800.29s -> 5802.29s]  It should be easier than the other ones we fought
[5804.20s -> 5806.40s]  Theoretically, I can't really reach him
[5818.37s -> 5830.08s]  I can't reach him
[5830.72s -> 5845.25s]  I'm not big enough. Okay. Here you go. Jerma. What do you got now?
[5847.17s -> 5848.45s]  Oh
[5848.45s -> 5850.53s]  Let me look at a bird a bird friend
[5852.91s -> 5857.55s]  11 summon summon damage very weak knockback uses 10 minutes summons a hatchling to zap your foes
[5858.67s -> 5861.60s]  So I should use more than one item ticket, right?
[5862.32s -> 5866.56s]  Yeah, you can always that summon will always be out as long as you cast it. Oh, okay. Cool
[5867.84s -> 5871.20s]  Wow, he's going down again. It follows things and shoots things. Okay. Now take these
[5871.36s -> 5877.84s]  This is a learning moment because i'm not gonna leave you 10 miles behind. These are sandstone ingots. Yep, take those to the guide
[5878.56s -> 5882.08s]  Okay, and do the crafting thing so you can see what you can make from sandstone
[5883.12s -> 5884.64s]  Okay
[5884.64s -> 5886.98s]  But first let me do my responsibility
[5888.56s -> 5890.56s]  Which is fix this shit up
[5893.97s -> 5896.05s]  He's gonna craft a sandstone bath
[5897.01s -> 5899.50s]  I mean if you're dirty
[5899.50s -> 5901.31s]  Can you do that?
[5901.31s -> 5902.94s]  And maybe
[5902.94s -> 5904.70s]  I don't think so
[5904.78s -> 5910.24s]  The sand also always falls when you place it so you can place it from up here and it'll drop down
[5915.86s -> 5917.54s]  Fixed it
[5917.54s -> 5922.34s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What what what we need the tube below the door so monsters don't get in
[5922.98s -> 5925.79s]  Oh

[5943.07s -> 5945.07s]  Oh sandstone pickaxe
[5945.63s -> 5948.75s]  We need one of those really bad actually sandstone pickaxe
[5950.67s -> 5953.07s]  What about um sandstone greaves?
[5956.14s -> 5959.02s]  Uh pickaxe 100 we need it
[5959.74s -> 5962.51s]  Okay
[5962.51s -> 5964.67s]  I'm sorry. I've made this seem like you're gonna have choices
[5965.47s -> 5968.35s]  Uh, did I make it?
[5968.43s -> 5971.31s]  You have to actually go to the anvil and make it. He's just showing you what you can make
[5971.55s -> 5973.55s]  It's not in your inventory while you're showing it to him
[5974.51s -> 5976.94s]  What did I just do I just heard like that
[5977.82s -> 5982.40s]  What the hell was that? Oh, no. No, he just gave it back to me. Okay, I get it
[5983.52s -> 5985.52s]  Yeah, all right anvil
[5986.06s -> 5989.18s]  Uh sandstone pickaxe should we both have one do you want one too?
[5991.33s -> 5992.45s]  um
[5992.45s -> 5995.25s]  Only one of us needs to have one. Okay, so then should I make
[5996.45s -> 5997.57s]  like a
[5997.57s -> 6003.73s]  Sandstone big yeah, we if there's also something you want to make I can summon the boss again and we can get more sandstone ingot
[6004.13s -> 6005.41s]  We can
[6005.49s -> 6007.49s]  Yeah, actually
[6007.49s -> 6012.13s]  I'm remembering the sandstone armor set is really really good, but we're gonna kill him like twice
[6012.53s -> 6014.93s]  Okay, so I got sandstone helmet sandstone greaves
[6016.21s -> 6017.17s]  Yeah
[6017.17s -> 6019.41s]  Two percent movement speed five percent throwing damage
[6020.77s -> 6022.77s]  All right, i'm gonna make the helmet
[6025.12s -> 6026.96s]  Are there multiple helmets?
[6026.96s -> 6028.96s]  This nothing I don't think so
[6029.36s -> 6032.56s]  I've made sandstone helmet thrower class fuck
[6033.60s -> 6037.02s]  Did I do something wrong?
[6037.02s -> 6038.38s]  No, you're fine
[6038.62s -> 6040.62s]  There's not like a mage class
[6040.86s -> 6047.34s]  Sometimes armor sets have multiple helmets so you can make it your class, but I think that set only has one. Okay
[6048.58s -> 6051.66s]  Well, I have it on now
[6051.66s -> 6056.06s]  Oh, that looks cool. You can only summon him during the day though. So we've got some time you have the pickaxe
[6056.78s -> 6057.82s]  I do
[6057.82s -> 6059.82s]  Let's go in this hole
[6063.10s -> 6066.70s]  So the pickaxe this pickaxe is like really weak and slow and stuff
[6068.22s -> 6071.42s]  Or is it is there any is there any reason at all for me to ever use?
[6072.14s -> 6077.42s]  The copper pickaxe ever again. No, once you get a new pickaxe, the old one is done forever. Okay
[6078.62s -> 6083.09s]  I'm gonna sell it
[6083.65s -> 6088.05s]  The like old shit like copper pickaxe is really not even worth selling either. Oh
[6091.18s -> 6093.98s]  Okay, so we this is how you can get that. Uh
[6094.70s -> 6097.74s]  This is how they get the shit that we couldn't get before the fossil stuff, right?
[6098.30s -> 6103.98s]  I'm pretty sure we can get fossil with that pickaxe. Yeah, and we need that pretty bad willy the traveling merchant has
[6104.94s -> 6114.99s]  Disappeared okay right down here. This like dirt ground is possible
[6117.12s -> 6118.80s]  Okay
[6118.80s -> 6123.02s]  Does that work?
[6123.02s -> 6127.50s]  Dang, then we still can't get it. I'm pretty sure we're gonna need to get demonite pickaxe
[6128.46s -> 6130.62s]  So what can we do with this? Is it just faster?
[6132.38s -> 6135.36s]  Just faster. Yeah
[6135.36s -> 6138.48s]  It'll if you look at your pickaxe it says pickaxe power
[6139.12s -> 6144.00s]  Something percent 55 percent power. Yeah, my power on my wood pickaxe is 30
[6144.56s -> 6147.44s]  Oh, so it's like that much faster demons
[6163.55s -> 6165.55s]  He did it he did the star
[6166.90s -> 6168.90s]  Mine mine mine. You're a newbie
[6169.70s -> 6172.74s]  You I gave you the other one. I I gave you mine anyways
[6175.49s -> 6185.06s]  noob
[6185.06s -> 6190.05s]  Wow, I'm almost dead. The campfires give more health for jen
[6193.70s -> 6199.26s]  Oh, isn't the meteorite fault? Yeah, we could go get the meteorite, but we don't know where it is. I don't think
[6201.12s -> 6203.04s]  and
[6203.04s -> 6207.84s]  If you think row right would actually become somewhat irrelevant soon here. It's good for mage so we could go do that
[6208.16s -> 6210.48s]  Don't don't drop those stars in daylight. They break
[6211.44s -> 6213.44s]  Yeah, i'm yeah
[6213.44s -> 6219.86s]  Yeah, I don't know if you knew that. All right, so I got
[6221.34s -> 6225.70s]  All right, we need to go in the jungle to get them. We need more minerals people saying
[6226.74s -> 6228.74s]  more minerals minerals
[6232.29s -> 6236.45s]  Come on minerals. So who are we going to lock in here?
[6237.82s -> 6239.98s]  Uh, who shows up is kind of random
[6240.06s -> 6243.42s]  It's if you meant the prerequisite for the npc to show up they show up
[6243.98s -> 6247.10s]  And I want the um, there's a guy who sells bullets that I really need
[6250.14s -> 6255.18s]  Because I would like some bullets. Can you make you your those two guys stop jumping around. It's distracting me
[6258.18s -> 6260.18s]  I can't squirrel
[6260.34s -> 6267.47s]  Can I pick it up? Wait, in fact, i'm gonna call you a golden fox just came in the house
[6270.75s -> 6278.18s]  Hey, it was a squirrel germ. I'm gonna trade you. I'll trade you my helmet for your helmet
[6278.18s -> 6282.46s]  We could have no if you have my helmet you can have two birds
[6283.70s -> 6286.26s]  You should have two guys
[6289.84s -> 6310.48s]  I think about it. Okay here am I getting scammed? Oh, oh, I'm sorry your helmet

[6335.28s -> 6336.72s]  All right. So now what?
[6336.72s -> 6342.00s]  Are we gonna fight that boss? Um, I think we have to because we have to wait till morning anyway
[6343.70s -> 6346.74s]  We can go and fight. I actually know it's starting morning
[6347.38s -> 6349.38s]  Everyone's yelling star roof
[6349.78s -> 6352.74s]  Star roof everyone's like saying star roof
[6354.32s -> 6356.64s]  I get on it. Let me make sure I can summon this

[6608.18s -> 6610.90s]  I can't reach with the staff. The birds did a ton of damage
[6611.54s -> 6620.19s]  What are you guys talking about?
[6620.19s -> 6621.39s]  another
[6621.39s -> 6623.39s]  bird another bird
[6623.63s -> 6625.79s]  I want us to both have the armor set
[6630.42s -> 6634.02s]  Oh, why you'll you'll fucking see you
[6635.22s -> 6644.70s]  Okay, it's just that reach my look at my birds doing all that work

[6652.05s -> 6656.54s]  Yeah, everything I get star has to have two
[6657.18s -> 6660.14s]  How many ingots do you have? I am the little brother I have
[6661.26s -> 6662.30s]  uh
[6662.30s -> 6664.30s]  three
[6664.98s -> 6666.74s]  Hand him over
[6666.74s -> 6678.10s]  I was gonna wait till you said please but it is your game. I'm making them for you. It is your server
[6678.66s -> 6681.70s]  Yeah, we need to kill him like maybe one more time. This guy's having a
[6682.66s -> 6684.66s]  Are they having like a tea party on a grave?
[6698.75s -> 6701.97s]  He's so loud. He's pretty loud. He's a screecher
[6709.65s -> 6718.67s]  What he's too far I keep he goes too far away from me
[6719.47s -> 6721.90s]  You have the thing that goes across the whole screen. I don't
[6722.78s -> 6729.27s]  Dermar you're contributing a deadly didgeridoo
[6730.21s -> 6734.10s]  What's up? Why do you have?
[6734.58s -> 6736.70s]  What is over your head?
[6736.70s -> 6738.54s]  uh
[6738.54s -> 6742.06s]  Bard inspiration they can only cast like that many times for using music
[6742.54s -> 6744.37s]  oh
[6744.37s -> 6747.01s]  And then it buffs people near you and stuff which also
[6748.53s -> 6750.37s]  Isn't magic damage
[6750.37s -> 6755.01s]  So where are all these people there are like hundreds of thousands of people at this party
[6756.69s -> 6758.69s]  The painter showed up
[6759.09s -> 6761.09s]  He can he can just go die
[6762.86s -> 6768.85s]  I came for the party
[6768.85s -> 6770.05s]  So what do you say?
[6770.05s -> 6772.59s]  Go my inventory and what?
[6772.59s -> 6774.43s]  I gave you the armor
[6774.43s -> 6778.11s]  You that's all you have now, right? Because you gave me the helmet. I don't see
[6779.55s -> 6782.59s]  It's on the roof. Oh armor on roof
[6783.98s -> 6785.98s]  Is the painter gonna be okay?
[6787.38s -> 6791.47s]  Yeah, let him die
[6791.87s -> 6793.87s]  Seriously, let him die. Why is he bad?
[6794.59s -> 6797.52s]  He doesn't do anything
[6797.52s -> 6801.36s]  All right, so we rely on unless you want two birds, but this makes you double jump
[6801.52s -> 6804.00s]  I kind of I want two birds. I think but hold on
[6805.26s -> 6807.98s]  I can do the the helmet. No, I can do the
[6808.70s -> 6810.06s]  the greaves
[6810.06s -> 6812.06s]  And you need the whole step for a double jump
[6812.54s -> 6815.74s]  The two birds are really good
[6822.46s -> 6827.71s]  No, i'm gonna hold on. I want the two birds
[6827.79s -> 6828.67s]  Yeah
[6828.67s -> 6830.11s]  I like the two birds
[6830.51s -> 6835.31s]  There's another armor set here that we could make you but it's these are such an you're so annoying
[6836.19s -> 6837.86s]  no
[6837.86s -> 6839.86s]  This painter
[6842.42s -> 6844.02s]  Get him bruno
[6844.02s -> 6850.08s]  Should we actually let him die?
[6850.08s -> 6851.44s]  Yeah
[6851.44s -> 6852.72s]  Are you sure?
[6852.72s -> 6857.36s]  All right, let's go. Let's go chop chop chop chop. What does he do? Okay. I'm gonna what does he do?

[6902.02s -> 6906.30s]  Look, it's a candy cane
[6907.18s -> 6912.06s]  Oh man, you could you could be really slim and slender just like a candy cane. Oh, whoa

[6935.30s -> 6940.67s]  All right, let's go. I don't know

[6952.40s -> 6954.40s]  Yeah, but i'm gonna lose my bird
[6955.47s -> 6957.47s]  And you're better off having the double birds
[6963.89s -> 6965.89s]  That's so good though
[6965.97s -> 6969.09s]  That's uh, this is not a double jump. This is a jet pack
[6969.89s -> 6974.21s]  Yeah, here's a book take that book. That's you can shoot things at a distance with that book
[6976.32s -> 6979.12s]  It's a spell is it better than the vial for
[6979.84s -> 6983.89s]  Well, it shoots further you're complaining about not being able to shoot far enough
[6984.77s -> 6987.20s]  You can have two
[6987.20s -> 6995.73s]  Okay. Oh cool. How fast gonna do it?
[6999.34s -> 7002.30s]  This is very overwhelming, but it's very fun. All right, hold on
[7002.94s -> 7005.62s]  10 mana 5 mana
[7005.62s -> 7006.90s]  fast
[7006.90s -> 7008.90s]  16 damage 4% for it
[7009.22s -> 7011.22s]  All right. This is this is good
[7013.12s -> 7014.40s]  golden duck
[7014.40s -> 7019.36s]  Can you actually do anything with the gold animals besides think they're cool?
[7020.48s -> 7028.40s]  I mean that answer is no. I thought that was a sound board that you just put in
[7030.13s -> 7032.13s]  That boing was oh no, what?
[7032.69s -> 7034.85s]  Jump makes you go forward a little faster
[7035.65s -> 7038.42s]  Don't leave me hanging
[7038.42s -> 7044.75s]  Oh, yeah, you don't have it
[7045.94s -> 7048.37s]  You can sell them for gold
[7048.37s -> 7051.18s]  So why are you killing them?
[7051.18s -> 7052.85s]  Okay, jerma
[7052.85s -> 7056.05s]  Go through the process of like taming an animal do it
[7057.89s -> 7059.87s]  Is it a pain in the ass?
[7059.87s -> 7063.07s]  I don't know how to do it. It's I know it's 10 gold never done it
[7065.82s -> 7067.82s]  Put them in a net and sell
[7068.30s -> 7070.54s]  We only we only imprison people here
[7071.66s -> 7073.66s]  Hey, i'm not the expert. You're supposed to be the expert
[7077.39s -> 7079.39s]  So what's the current objective now?
[7079.47s -> 7081.47s]  The current objective is to go back to that
[7082.62s -> 7087.58s]  Corruption area the purple area when you destroy three of those shadow orbs it summons a boss
[7088.54s -> 7089.42s]  Oh
[7089.42s -> 7091.18s]  We want to kill that boss
[7091.18s -> 7093.18s]  Because then we can mine the fossil
[7094.61s -> 7096.69s]  And then when we can mine the fossil we can go to hell
[7101.71s -> 7103.78s]  This is cool
[7103.78s -> 7106.40s]  Not on expert mode
[7106.48s -> 7108.72s]  No, what would expert mode change?
[7110.45s -> 7114.05s]  bosses get more health deal more damage and you die a lot
[7116.56s -> 7118.24s]  and it takes like
[7118.24s -> 7120.32s]  Three times as long to play through and do anything
[7121.36s -> 7123.36s]  I uh, we would not have killed one boss yet
[7124.16s -> 7130.86s]  Hmm. That's good. I've got like a spelunking potion
[7131.42s -> 7134.96s]  What was that?
[7134.96s -> 7136.96s]  It's way more good
[7137.68s -> 7140.56s]  Yeah, you get there's more interesting drops than expert but I i'm
[7141.97s -> 7143.25s]  You wouldn't want to play it
[7143.25s -> 7146.61s]  I just try I probably wouldn't not on my first ever time playing the game
[7146.85s -> 7149.17s]  I think you like don't even know what anything
[7150.29s -> 7152.29s]  And you're like, where am I not expert mode?
[7153.09s -> 7155.09s]  Would I do it like would I talk like that?
[7155.09s -> 7157.09s]  No, that's what the other guy would talk like
[7159.07s -> 7167.78s]  Oh
[7167.78s -> 7169.78s]  Dark too dark. Oh
[7170.18s -> 7172.54s]  Holy shit. Thank god
[7172.54s -> 7174.54s]  This little thing just saved my life
[7175.10s -> 7177.10s]  No, it didn't um
[7177.58s -> 7187.95s]  How did you even get over there? Oh, you have a double jump, right? I can't just follow you blindly
[7190.10s -> 7196.14s]  How do you heal yourself?
[7196.14s -> 7202.54s]  Ah, I can't mine this
[7203.02s -> 7205.58s]  No, all right. I gotta put a platform down on that helmet
[7206.85s -> 7209.65s]  Especially for this boss trust, but you're gonna need it
[7213.20s -> 7215.20s]  Let's sacrifice the one bird for now
[7217.12s -> 7219.36s]  Really? I just hit my fucking head on this
[7219.92s -> 7221.92s]  You have to hold space you spend longer
[7223.02s -> 7224.86s]  All right. I think i'm good
[7224.86s -> 7230.75s]  A horrible chill goes down your spine
[7234.72s -> 7236.32s]  Okay, take this
[7236.32s -> 7238.58s]  as well
[7238.58s -> 7240.46s]  Musket
[7240.46s -> 7244.62s]  And i'm taking this for what specific reason because it does 32 damage
[7245.18s -> 7247.74s]  Oh, that's a lot
[7247.82s -> 7249.82s]  Um use that as your long range
[7251.10s -> 7253.26s]  Your vile thorn will be a lot better on this boss though
[7254.14s -> 7256.22s]  Okay
[7256.22s -> 7258.14s]  all right
[7258.14s -> 7262.88s]  vile thorn on the boss
[7262.88s -> 7266.48s]  Oh, don't don't walk in those bombs
[7267.52s -> 7274.35s]  I need more light down here, man. I'm gonna have to put some hold on
[7276.51s -> 7279.95s]  If we're gonna fight a boss like right now, I need to be able to see come back come back
[7280.64s -> 7282.64s]  What you need to start doing is go to the left
[7283.12s -> 7287.12s]  And make a rope up to the surface make a rope up to the surface
[7287.84s -> 7288.96s]  Yeah
[7288.96s -> 7294.03s]  Remember you can't mine through this so like go back to where we came down and make it as easy as
[7294.83s -> 7296.83s]  Possible to get up to the surface
[7297.15s -> 7299.15s]  What?
[7299.55s -> 7303.17s]  How did I fall
[7303.17s -> 7306.42s]  There's too much pressure
[7306.42s -> 7307.62s]  Was it here?
[7307.62s -> 7318.19s]  Was it right here?
[7318.19s -> 7320.19s]  Uh, actually you can wait on the surface for me
[7323.65s -> 7327.04s]  Ow, i'm gonna die
[7327.68s -> 7330.16s]  No, don't i'm not i'm not i'm fine fine
[7330.88s -> 7332.88s]  I need you fucking dark down here
[7355.87s -> 7358.67s]  Uh, tell me when you're on the surface, uh, not on the surface
[7360.13s -> 7363.65s]  Here's I am ready to pull the trigger on the fuck fiesta. Uh, do not do that yet
[7374.48s -> 7390.32s]  Dude, am I out of torches?
[7390.32s -> 7392.72s]  And we still like really only have 100 health each
[7393.44s -> 7395.44s]  um
[7395.84s -> 7397.84s]  His rope sucks just warning you
[7398.48s -> 7400.85s]  Okay
[7401.01s -> 7403.01s]  I need light
[7409.18s -> 7411.18s]  I don't know where the fuck i'm going man
[7411.58s -> 7413.58s]  I don't know what i'm doing
[7414.99s -> 7416.99s]  Oh my god, I
[7417.07s -> 7421.47s]  I don't know what i'm doing make it as easy as possible to get to the top
[7422.96s -> 7424.78s]  hell
[7424.78s -> 7426.86s]  I got stuck down here. All right
[7431.68s -> 7435.04s]  You know what you just wait on the top and I have a potion to tell it to you
[7436.50s -> 7438.50s]  Why do I have to wait down here?
[7440.93s -> 7442.93s]  Because a giant worm is going to come out on the ground
[7444.22s -> 7446.22s]  And if you're inside these tunnels when it appears
[7447.34s -> 7449.10s]  You just get warmed
[7449.10s -> 7451.71s]  All right, so i'm worried that i'm on the surface
[7452.59s -> 7455.87s]  Okay, uh, can you build like a platform above the ground with uh
[7457.26s -> 7460.62s]  Wood platforms. Do you have any? Yeah platform above the ground
[7460.62s -> 7463.02s]  You want me just to like go like you had like the other one you had?
[7463.58s -> 7464.54s]  Yeah, yeah
[7464.54s -> 7466.54s]  I don't have any fucking torches though
[7467.18s -> 7475.70s]  I can't see shit
[7475.70s -> 7480.93s]  Uh, i'm gonna be i'm gonna be very very like just franking up front about this
[7482.38s -> 7484.38s]  I don't know if i'm okay. I can't do this
[7484.54s -> 7486.54s]  Um
[7486.78s -> 7488.06s]  It's okay to admit it
[7488.06s -> 7492.94s]  I i'm not gonna be like yeah, sure man like here we go. Um, like i'm i'm kind of i'm kind of stuck
[7493.74s -> 7497.18s]  I'm kind of like overwhelmed. I'm gonna summon the boss
[7497.90s -> 7501.50s]  Okay, I need wood. Hold on and then i'm gonna teleport to you
[7503.87s -> 7506.11s]  And then we're just gonna make the best of it with our double jump
[7507.23s -> 7510.03s]  Okay, hold on. I'm gonna turn his brightness up now. I'm enjoying this
[7511.15s -> 7515.18s]  Where do I go?
[7531.71s -> 7533.54s]  Doing good
[7533.54s -> 7535.46s]  I can handle this
[7535.46s -> 7538.59s]  Hey, uh, I can handle it. Don't worry. Yes. So I believe you
[7542.46s -> 7544.54s]  Uh, I a little overwhelming I need
[7545.66s -> 7550.82s]  You see if it would be playing I would probably still be cutting down trees and building a house
[7551.54s -> 7557.98s]  We're fighting like monsters and getting new gear and I I would have just built a candy cane house
[7559.52s -> 7561.52s]  All right. Hold on. You don't have enough candy cane
[7561.84s -> 7565.30s]  What the fuck already here?
[7570.82s -> 7573.30s]  I'm just i'm just gonna wait for you and do some other stuff
[7576.48s -> 7580.62s]  I was gonna keep him
[7581.18s -> 7583.18s]  Get me please. All right, just
[7584.22s -> 7586.72s]  I'm losing my fucking mind
[7588.05s -> 7597.12s]  I'm losing my fucking mind. Okay torch. I need just give me a bunch

[7627.42s -> 7633.95s]  Get out of here. All right
[7637.92s -> 7643.60s]  I need to like relax because i'm like actually like panic getting overwhelmed by all this shit in the inventory
[7644.08s -> 7646.08s]  And all the things in the game. All right
[7646.24s -> 7652.03s]  Okay, get my book up here. No, I don't need that. Okay, I have potions
[7652.67s -> 7656.00s]  All right. Let me just deposit this bullshit
[7656.80s -> 7665.34s]  I don't know what the fuck I even want with all this. No hold it here. It's fine
[7666.56s -> 7669.12s]  Fine get rid of everything else. I I guess
[7678.86s -> 7680.86s]  All right, so I have
[7682.14s -> 7684.14s]  Stupid fucking tiki torches, man
[7684.38s -> 7686.38s]  I'm gonna build the thing that you wanted to build
[7687.18s -> 7689.18s]  Right, you're gonna you're gonna do it
[7691.78s -> 7692.90s]  Are you sure?
[7692.90s -> 7694.51s]  Probably not
[7694.51s -> 7697.23s]  I'm worried about is there wood even in do we have any wood?
[7697.55s -> 7702.83s]  I I cut down trees trees on your way back, but I died. There's plenty I died. I fell down a hole
[7703.31s -> 7705.15s]  I think you missed that part
[7705.15s -> 7707.15s]  Yeah, but you still have all your things
[7707.39s -> 7713.57s]  Buy torches from the merchant. You see here's the thing. Uh, he has locked
[7714.99s -> 7719.79s]  Like seven people in here. I don't know what any of these people do besides this guy. He sells dynamite
[7720.51s -> 7737.30s]  I'm worried about you. No, I'm good rescue
[7738.10s -> 7740.34s]  Rescue them. I just start breaking them out
[7741.06s -> 7742.02s]  Okay
[7742.02s -> 7748.43s]  I'm just gonna need to come back. I have so much junk in my inventory. So all right. All right. Okay, it's just I
[7748.91s -> 7752.35s]  It's just too dark
[7752.35s -> 7754.35s]  What is your gamma at? Tell me what it is
[7757.52s -> 7771.41s]  Uh, where is gamma? I don't know. I don't know. It's in nvidia settings
[7771.89s -> 7779.87s]  What is parallax?
[7780.83s -> 7783.54s]  Real
[7783.54s -> 7784.74s]  All right. Um
[7784.74s -> 7787.70s]  Did you you're coming back, right? I'm in here with you
[7800.66s -> 7810.93s]  So you wanted to deposit stuff? I'm doing a drop. Do you need torches? I can make you torches
[7812.32s -> 7815.90s]  No, I have torches
[7815.90s -> 7822.61s]  I figured it out. I have potions. I have torches. I have food
[7826.72s -> 7828.72s]  Video settings change lighting to white
[7832.77s -> 7835.71s]  Why is it like a sandstorm?
[7835.71s -> 7840.45s]  I don't know
[7840.45s -> 7842.29s]  I'll get like 50
[7842.29s -> 7844.29s]  50 is 50 torches good
[7844.29s -> 7847.65s]  You should get more more than 50. Okay
[7848.45s -> 7851.41s]  Because you'll always be using torches. There's no reason to not have more
[7852.53s -> 7854.74s]  If you can make 100
[7854.74s -> 7858.27s]  Like 300
[7858.27s -> 7863.23s]  I mean how much you panic when you don't have a torch. Do you ever want that to happen again? No, never. Okay
[7864.03s -> 7869.02s]  So I got gun. I've got food. I've got health
[7869.74s -> 7871.65s]  I got my bird

[7927.87s -> 7929.87s]  Oh, is that a different spot?
[7930.46s -> 7931.98s]  Hmm
[7931.98s -> 7936.51s]  Never mind ignore me
[7936.51s -> 7941.70s]  That's such a cool item
[7949.47s -> 7951.12s]  Oh my god
[7951.12s -> 7954.56s]  I don't think hold on imagine you died from up there. That would've been so funny
[7955.52s -> 7959.15s]  I don't laugh normally these don't let you jump a second time
[7960.19s -> 7963.97s]  You know, we also need is an anti-gravity potion
[7965.78s -> 7967.38s]  What is that?
[7967.38s -> 7971.22s]  It turns gravity upside down so you fly up in the air and there's planets in the sky
[7973.01s -> 7976.58s]  Do a zombie impression?
[7976.58s -> 7979.06s]  Like I feel like that's a star thing. That's a star request
[7980.42s -> 7985.73s]  Here take mana crystal. Yeah, I just take that right now, right?

[8003.57s -> 8005.57s]  Is that not enough?
[8005.57s -> 8011.41s]  That's not enough. I didn't tell me a number. I didn't I didn't know if more if yeah, I needed more than like 40
[8011.89s -> 8015.33s]  39 is not enough like 200. I did 200
[8016.21s -> 8018.21s]  Okay. Well, let's get them now
[8020.32s -> 8022.48s]  All right. I don't I don't even have an axe anymore
[8023.84s -> 8028.13s]  I'll get it. I'll get it
[8028.69s -> 8031.65s]  I'm just along for the ride. I'm just along for the ride
[8036.46s -> 8041.58s]  Yeah, I got I i'm i'm about to see i'm a seafood guy. You know, I see food I eat it, you know
[8043.66s -> 8045.66s]  Thanks to the 50 bucks
[8049.79s -> 8056.14s]  Indeed
[8056.14s -> 8057.66s]  Okay, i've got
[8057.66s -> 8059.66s]  You see how long this took? I have
[8060.36s -> 8061.66s]  340
[8061.66s -> 8068.27s]  Okay, so I have a lot too already, uh, but honestly tim tim gave 50 more dollars
[8068.27s -> 8070.35s]  This is addressed to you. So you might want to listen to this
[8070.91s -> 8072.83s]  Oh, this is to me. Yes, uh tim
[8074.11s -> 8078.59s]  96 give 50 more dollars and they said don't tell star this. Oh, okay
[8079.39s -> 8082.26s]  I won't read the rest then
[8082.26s -> 8091.01s]  I brought some people
[8091.01s -> 8094.69s]  By the way, uh spoiler alert. He said I am much more handsome than you
[8095.76s -> 8097.60s]  That's fine
[8097.60s -> 8102.02s]  I told him
[8102.02s -> 8103.54s]  How?
[8103.54s -> 8109.31s]  Okay, I feel like this is cheating you're making your own final destination
[8111.46s -> 8114.98s]  You wait there
[8114.98s -> 8116.98s]  You can do that, right? I can do that
[8124.37s -> 8127.82s]  Finally, I can see the sun
[8127.82s -> 8129.82s]  I could see the sun. All right. What are
[8129.98s -> 8131.98s]  What are this guy's mechanics? What does he do?
[8132.70s -> 8135.42s]  Does he you know the first worm we fought that died really quickly?
[8135.98s -> 8140.22s]  Yeah, uh, I guess it's it's one of those worms are like that are common enemies
[8140.46s -> 8144.94s]  But uh, he splits into segments and he you have to like kill every single part of the worm
[8145.10s -> 8150.78s]  Because they just keep worm that flies around so if you're above the ground it makes it a lot easier to dodge
[8151.02s -> 8153.02s]  Because he's gonna come up at you
[8153.66s -> 8166.58s]  Okay, are you ready
[8166.58s -> 8168.58s]  I am I guess as ready as i'm gonna be
[8170.37s -> 8172.61s]  I'm not sure what that means, but I guess so
[8173.73s -> 8175.73s]  eater of worlds segments left
[8176.51s -> 8178.69s]  57
[8178.69s -> 8180.69s]  That seems like a lot. Yeah
[8183.25s -> 8185.25s]  Oh these stick to the fucking thing
[8186.77s -> 8203.36s]  That's him down there
[8203.36s -> 8214.64s]  I didn't though. I'm fine
[8214.64s -> 8216.64s]  Nice. All right. Careful. He's coming in. He's wrapping around you
[8219.55s -> 8220.59s]  Careful
[8220.59s -> 8234.03s]  All right, you see now he's like 30 worms now. Yeah, he's a lot of worms gonna eat the world next
[8260.99s -> 8265.41s]  Oh that hurt
[8265.41s -> 8267.81s]  Inside of my nose is it's it's just it's ever been in my whole life
[8269.97s -> 8274.61s]  That's somebody put like sneezing powder in my nose they just came in here and just like blew it up in my nose
[8278.22s -> 8279.26s]  Is that it?
[8279.26s -> 8281.95s]  I think that's the last one more
[8282.43s -> 8293.94s]  There's two segments left scratch it. I can't you did it you did it
[8297.44s -> 8300.80s]  All right, you okay, you're like sniffing in your microphone and I really appreciate it
[8301.52s -> 8304.42s]  So what do we get?
[8304.42s -> 8307.87s]  Oh, hold on. This thing is actually really good
[8310.43s -> 8313.31s]  They were just lined up on the bridge and I could just run this way and go like that
[8317.81s -> 8319.81s]  Yeah, that way. Oh, yeah star the master looter
[8320.61s -> 8326.05s]  Every single one of those little splits drops, uh demonite ore and shadow scales make sure you picked them all up
[8326.05s -> 8328.13s]  That's around here. Yeah, i've been running around looking around
[8329.63s -> 8332.32s]  on the top here
[8332.88s -> 8334.88s]  He dropped a healing staff
[8335.12s -> 8337.74s]  Healing staff
[8337.74s -> 8340.46s]  Am I doing lines of coke to be able to play terraria?
[8341.26s -> 8344.05s]  What are you thinking?
[8344.05s -> 8346.61s]  What are you thinking with that nonsense?
[8347.33s -> 8349.33s]  Get that out of my chapel
[8351.12s -> 8354.96s]  Don't do it for a lot less
[8354.96s -> 8357.92s]  Yeah, hey dig into hell still the title of this ring. When are we going?
[8359.97s -> 8361.97s]  Uh, we should be able to go now
[8362.61s -> 8365.87s]  So that ore you're talking about
[8365.87s -> 8367.95s]  I have a lot of it
[8367.95s -> 8369.95s]  Yeah, uh recall potion go back
[8371.78s -> 8381.68s]  Come on. Okay
[8381.68s -> 8385.92s]  So then i'm gonna give it to the jeffrey and he's gonna tell me what it does
[8386.96s -> 8389.52s]  Okay, i've made the pickaxe so you don't need to make one
[8390.08s -> 8391.12s]  Okay
[8391.12s -> 8393.20s]  Yeah, okay, so I can make demonite brick
[8394.24s -> 8396.30s]  demonite bar
[8396.30s -> 8399.38s]  Why would you make demonite brick?
[8400.29s -> 8405.17s]  Just because you think it looks cool. Oh, okay. So demonite bar. I think he has a summon. That's pretty good
[8405.17s -> 8407.17s]  That should be a little bit better than
[8407.49s -> 8410.30s]  So do I have to make a bar and then put the bar in here?
[8411.02s -> 8413.02s]  Yeah, make a bar at the furnace
[8414.42s -> 8415.78s]  and then
[8415.86s -> 8420.34s]  Here i'll drop you the shadow scales. Here's the rest of the bars. I just needed the um
[8422.24s -> 8423.60s]  pickaxe
[8423.60s -> 8425.84s]  And you can do whatever you want with those. Oh, okay
[8426.80s -> 8432.75s]  There's a lot of stuff here
[8432.75s -> 8436.11s]  Fisher of the souls 20 more fishing power
[8437.81s -> 8439.81s]  There's a whole fishing thing. I've never done it
[8440.53s -> 8442.53s]  You would probably what the fuck is going on
[8449.26s -> 8452.90s]  Uh, all right, I did put the scales in trash
[8453.86s -> 8460.26s]  What does that mean did I accidentally trash the bars you threw the bars in the trash
[8467.84s -> 8472.46s]  Where's the uh, don't I have demon ore still? Yeah. Oh
[8473.26s -> 8475.26s]  Okay, if you need any more shadow skills, I have 20
[8476.38s -> 8479.66s]  Is there a way to quickly just go to uh, here we go
[8481.30s -> 8485.38s]  When you're crafting there is a button you can press that makes it show all on screen. Yeah, it's a lot easier
[8488.99s -> 8490.03s]  All right
[8490.03s -> 8492.03s]  So now i'm gonna look at this again
[8493.70s -> 8498.88s]  I just I try to shoot him
[8498.88s -> 8500.88s]  jester shirt jester's mask
[8502.42s -> 8504.18s]  minion damage, ooh
[8504.18s -> 8513.62s]  This increases minion damage by 15 by 20 percent increases your max number of minions
[8514.58s -> 8518.34s]  Oh, man
[8518.34s -> 8520.35s]  So wait, I can do
[8520.35s -> 8522.91s]  One two two extra minions with this set on
[8525.94s -> 8528.26s]  Uh, yes. Yeah, this i'm gonna do this
[8528.98s -> 8535.09s]  How many what does this cost?
[8535.09s -> 8538.29s]  seven defense
[8538.29s -> 8539.47s]  I need
[8539.47s -> 8543.09s]  14 bars five spirit droplets and 40 bones
[8543.97s -> 8550.16s]  How many materials do we cannot get those yet? And if you're seeing like some really weird items
[8550.24s -> 8553.04s]  There's items that are animated. We cannot get those good
[8553.44s -> 8554.40s]  No
[8554.40s -> 8559.76s]  The I think generally speaking the further you scroll down the list the less likely we are to craft them. Oh
[8560.48s -> 8561.76s]  oh
[8561.76s -> 8563.28s]  Really?
[8563.28s -> 8569.76s]  All right, you're just gonna have to keep playing bar. No do the magic storage. We need uh emeralds before we can make a heart
[8570.72s -> 8576.11s]  It's bane demon bow, is there another uh, is it like a demon wand?
[8577.47s -> 8580.99s]  If it's not on that list there isn't one
[8582.02s -> 8585.54s]  I think vile thorns better than what dark wave here we go dark wave
[8587.94s -> 8592.10s]  Sends out a wave of dark energy. What does it take? Oh, I can make this 18 versus
[8593.54s -> 8594.82s]  10
[8594.82s -> 8600.45s]  What's the book 16?
[8603.54s -> 8606.00s]  The book is better
[8606.00s -> 8610.40s]  Fast speed versus fast speed six mana versus five
[8611.52s -> 8617.62s]  That's not very good walking gold fishing desert star
[8619.28s -> 8622.61s]  Yep
[8622.61s -> 8624.61s]  16 versus 18
[8625.01s -> 8627.81s]  I'm gonna i'll try it. I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna make the uh the dark wave
[8628.77s -> 8630.77s]  I forgot to craft the uh
[8637.73s -> 8639.25s]  I need your money
[8639.25s -> 8645.65s]  My money, what do you mean my money? Hey your gold the gold money you have I have 82 silver. I don't have very much
[8646.61s -> 8648.61s]  You don't have any gold pieces. No
[8650.24s -> 8652.18s]  Do you have any dynamite?
[8652.18s -> 8654.18s]  Uh, I have 27 bombs
[8654.74s -> 8657.62s]  I mean i'm gonna try this this new wand out though
[8660.70s -> 8663.63s]  Oh, that's pretty good it's fast
[8665.71s -> 8667.71s]  We need money
[8672.51s -> 8676.59s]  And I am not joking around germa i'm gonna sell some stuff
[8681.14s -> 8683.30s]  Uh, what about the shadow scale? What can I do with these?
[8684.26s -> 8686.18s]  They
[8686.18s -> 8688.66s]  Are also used with the demonite ore i'm pretty sure
[8689.30s -> 8691.30s]  Just for random recipes
[8691.30s -> 8696.50s]  Yeah, I'm a little unsure. I think they just kind of also use those same stuff
[8697.78s -> 8702.16s]  I just feel like I shouldn't even delete any of these things or sell any of them. I just don't know
[8703.36s -> 8707.81s]  I'm just depositing all my shit and I don't even know what to do with it
[8708.85s -> 8710.85s]  Buying net for the gold critters. I'll do that
[8713.87s -> 8715.47s]  a bug net
[8715.47s -> 8719.30s]  Can you catch them in a bug net?
[8720.02s -> 8722.42s]  Can you get the duck in a bug net? Can I can you?
[8723.22s -> 8725.70s]  I don't know. Oh, I okay. I gotta get this in. Yeah
[8726.66s -> 8731.46s]  All right. What can I do with the shadow scale stuff?
[8732.02s -> 8739.38s]  That shit didn't
[8739.38s -> 8742.26s]  Uh, can you organize this stuff? I don't know what to do
[8742.98s -> 8747.62s]  Um, eventually we're gonna make a super stash that will auto organize it. Oh, okay
[8748.10s -> 8750.42s]  We just really need emerald before we can do that
[8754.21s -> 8759.70s]  Ruin of bleeding the only critical damage restores life
[8760.42s -> 8762.42s]  Can't make any of these though. I don't think
[8763.50s -> 8764.22s]  ooh
[8764.22s -> 8765.74s]  ooh
[8765.74s -> 8767.54s]  ooh
[8767.54s -> 8770.74s]  Sorcerer's pants sorcerer's robe. I just do much more magic damage
[8773.60s -> 8777.12s]  Um, if you want better magic damage, we need to find the meteor
[8778.00s -> 8781.36s]  Should I just get some of the how much should I just do these now just to have it?
[8783.20s -> 8784.80s]  No, those are really
[8784.80s -> 8786.80s]  You're better off with a double jump for now
[8787.04s -> 8788.16s]  Really?
[8788.16s -> 8792.24s]  I think so. Yeah, I mean if you want to make them and you want to look like a wizard
[8793.20s -> 8796.32s]  I'm not gonna stop you. I'm actually I need disciples hat
[8797.36s -> 8800.69s]  I don't have enough
[8800.69s -> 8803.17s]  All right. Well, let's just let's just keep going. Let's just keep doing whatever
[8805.25s -> 8807.25s]  Make sure I have stuff. I have food
[8808.21s -> 8810.46s]  Okay, I got the bug net
[8810.46s -> 8812.46s]  I need some more potions
[8813.02s -> 8820.83s]  Those are very important. How much money do I have?
[8821.79s -> 8823.79s]  I can buy a ton of these
[8824.03s -> 8826.50s]  Get the 20
[8826.50s -> 8829.63s]  20 and 20
[8829.63s -> 8831.31s]  Yeah, I think so
[8831.31s -> 8837.50s]  The disciples hat is easy to make

[9179.81s -> 9181.41s]  Come over
[9181.41s -> 9182.77s]  crash
[9182.77s -> 9192.14s]  Okay, actually there's one over here, which is the perfect example of the thing we can't do
[9193.02s -> 9196.29s]  Okay
[9196.29s -> 9197.89s]  What is that exactly?
[9197.89s -> 9199.89s]  Do you see the demon carrying a guy?

[9225.73s -> 9230.14s]  Did you make a demon bed?
[9230.67s -> 9235.66s]  Oh, I know these are all these just were in the demons houses they sleep in beds. Yeah
[9236.38s -> 9238.38s]  Yeah, they're upset that we're here
[9242.61s -> 9245.25s]  I don't think I would assume a demon did not sleep in a bed
[9246.77s -> 9250.53s]  I always picture them hanging upside down with their eyes open and they sleep like that
[9251.74s -> 9254.94s]  Nope, they get under the covers very comfortable obsidian beds
[9255.74s -> 9261.22s]  You cheated not only gave it yourself. You didn't grow you didn't improve you took the shortcut and you didn't gain anything
[9262.18s -> 9264.74s]  You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked
[9266.46s -> 9268.46s]  And nothing was gained. Yeah, okay

[9288.16s -> 9293.76s]  Oh because the other they're referring to the coffee pasta that was spammed like probably four or five thousand times
[9294.72s -> 9300.34s]  I see
[9300.34s -> 9303.06s]  Do you have any normal blocks like placeable blocks?

[9362.83s -> 9364.83s]  Yeah, you can't open those what?
[9366.03s -> 9368.03s]  Oh, that's unfortunate
[9375.63s -> 9378.43s]  Uh, i'm pretty sure that's enough. We might need one emerald
[9379.78s -> 9383.04s]  So what's the next boss we can sell?
[9384.80s -> 9389.28s]  We never killed the eye, but that's like the first boss you're supposed to kill. I don't even think it's there anymore
[9390.80s -> 9391.92s]  um
[9391.92s -> 9393.92s]  We can fight crab you on

[9432.74s -> 9433.46s]  here
[9433.46s -> 9435.46s]  This is not the place to read things
[9435.62s -> 9437.31s]  uh
[9437.31s -> 9439.31s]  Come get the oversized sword here
[9439.55s -> 9445.42s]  It's on the ground. Have I put it down? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

[9494.74s -> 9504.77s]  Yeah
[9504.77s -> 9506.93s]  Magma ore how much do you think we need?
[9508.90s -> 9512.05s]  Um, forget what magma armor does
[9512.61s -> 9516.93s]  I don't think either of us are actually really going to use this but not much. There's a chest over there
[9524.37s -> 9525.82s]  Um
[9525.82s -> 9529.98s]  Where the fuck did you come from? He lives here

[9676.85s -> 9681.57s]  All right, this will make act one a little bit easier you literally have base health

[9739.10s -> 9741.70s]  I think
[9741.70s -> 9744.74s]  the eye
[9744.74s -> 9746.74s]  Unless you miraculously found diamond
[9747.62s -> 9752.10s]  No, I don't think so. It would be stuffed in one of those boxes along with

[10029.42s -> 10047.50s]  What are you doing? Nothing. I'm sealing your fate is what i'm doing. What does that mean people that are watching my stream?
[10047.58s -> 10049.58s]  No, and they they know what i'm doing
[10052.78s -> 10056.38s]  No, guys, i'm not trying to like mouse trap him by having that hit him in the head
[10056.78s -> 10058.78s]  I was sending his gravestone to hell
[10059.18s -> 10078.27s]  That's kind of fucked up
[10078.27s -> 10080.91s]  I'm bored. Okay. What am I doing up there?
[10082.19s -> 10092.13s]  Is it daytime?
[10092.13s -> 10098.53s]  Uh, is it night time? Oh fuck. It's been daytime for a very long time. No, no night time. It's it's it's dusk right now
[10100.08s -> 10104.48s]  Is it night time? It's it's dusk. It's the sun's going down
[10106.30s -> 10115.26s]  Okay, why are the pics of so much health?
[10118.11s -> 10120.11s]  Uh, because they give so much gold and bacon
[10120.67s -> 10126.99s]  It's just kind of a joke, you know, you ever laugh before. Oh, right bacon like money epic bacon
[10127.71s -> 10155.78s]  11 gold
[10155.78s -> 10158.34s]  That's so much. What is a huge amount of money?
[10159.39s -> 10161.55s]  What'd you say? What's like a what's a decent amount of money in the game?
[10163.02s -> 10165.02s]  uh for this early like
[10165.18s -> 10168.30s]  30 gold is pretty solid. I mean eventually you get platinum
[10169.50s -> 10171.50s]  Oh gold turns into platinum
[10172.38s -> 10178.38s]  That's pretty awesome. But the the most expensive things will be the traveling merchant has some things that sell for like 50 gold and usually they're
[10178.86s -> 10180.94s]  in their goofs
[10180.94s -> 10183.44s]  That's cool. And then beyond that you buy
[10183.82s -> 10186.10s]  dynamite
[10186.10s -> 10191.46s]  Is like one of the more expensive things I stored my money. I got like I got like 16 gold in that
[10192.26s -> 10197.12s]  case
[10197.44s -> 10201.04s]  So in the meantime, is this something I should be doing while i'm waiting for you to collect the thing to
[10201.60s -> 10203.60s]  uh go do uh
[10205.84s -> 10210.78s]  You can build a rope that goes to the sky are you just trying to like keep me occupied?
[10211.58s -> 10213.58s]  No, no, there's like uh
[10214.91s -> 10220.51s]  There's that's in the sky that's like a keep the like keep like the dumb guy occupied joke, right
[10221.71s -> 10224.98s]  No
[10224.98s -> 10227.30s]  I'm like digging underground just finding random chests
[10228.02s -> 10233.54s]  Uh, all right, and in the sky there are planets and there are floating clouds with buildings on them. Um, all right
[10233.54s -> 10235.54s]  That sounds pretty fun. I'm gonna go do that
[10235.70s -> 10241.84s]  Where's like rope? How do you how do you craft rope?
[10244.88s -> 10248.32s]  Do you have cobweb? You know, you haven't like really been underground much
[10249.28s -> 10252.42s]  Can you buy rope? I'm not sure
[10253.54s -> 10255.54s]  They're so hard to find without flight
[10260.83s -> 10265.79s]  There's a lot more in calamity mods. So the odds of you going up and they're being a planet are actually pretty high
[10265.87s -> 10267.87s]  These are expensive, man
[10268.75s -> 10270.83s]  What it's 10 copper for one?
[10271.87s -> 10273.47s]  That's rope nothing
[10273.47s -> 10274.99s]  There's nothing
[10274.99s -> 10278.62s]  Yeah
[10278.62s -> 10280.29s]  Are you sure?
[10280.29s -> 10281.41s]  Yeah
[10281.41s -> 10283.17s]  That's not expensive
[10283.17s -> 10290.16s]  Don't I need like 500 of these? That's one bullet. I don't I need I need like 500 of these
[10302.46s -> 10304.06s]  Okay
[10304.06s -> 10306.06s]  Here I have a gift for you. Do you like gifts?
[10307.15s -> 10309.07s]  I have a thousand rope
[10309.07s -> 10310.27s]  Take this
[10310.27s -> 10312.43s]  I wanted to give you a mirror a mirror
[10313.15s -> 10316.02s]  What does it do?
[10316.02s -> 10320.34s]  It does the same thing a recall potion does but it's infinite. Oh, that's cool
[10321.14s -> 10324.91s]  He was never gonna tell me it was nighttime
[10325.87s -> 10330.27s]  I told you what I said. Hey, it's I said it's dusk. It's dusk. It's dusk
[10330.35s -> 10363.15s]  Like that means like it's dusk. It's gonna be nighttime in a minute. This guy's a piece of shit the eye
[10370.21s -> 10373.07s]  This thing's kind of a chump
[10373.07s -> 10376.19s]  It's it's been first boss and like normal terraria
[10376.75s -> 10378.51s]  Oh
[10378.51s -> 10392.18s]  Is there a way to um regenerate mana?
[10393.63s -> 10394.59s]  better
[10394.59s -> 10398.83s]  Than uh, there are some items later. There's a lot of stuff but not yet. Do you here?
[10398.83s -> 10402.83s]  I'll give you my the mana potions. I know I I already I have a bunch of like lesser mana potions
[10402.83s -> 10404.83s]  But is there like an effective?
[10405.49s -> 10410.93s]  there's ways like the the health regeneration band I gave you can be turned into a
[10411.89s -> 10415.01s]  Mana regen actually, I think this orb I have can make something for you
[10416.29s -> 10418.29s]  Stand still. Oh, look at that
[10419.25s -> 10422.78s]  It dropped right next to us. So did you get the thing we wanted?
[10423.58s -> 10428.06s]  Okay, faun star
[10429.06s -> 10431.06s]  Doing it we have to summon him again
[10431.79s -> 10434.91s]  Uh, no, I got the thing. I need it. Oh, so what were you looking for?
[10435.79s -> 10439.47s]  I was looking for a shadow diamond so I can start making that crafting thing
[10439.71s -> 10441.15s]  Okay, so I got I got three stars
[10441.15s -> 10445.55s]  Should I what should I use these stars or do you need them for something important? No use them
[10446.43s -> 10448.91s]  Do I just use them like just put them in my hotbar and use three?
[10450.94s -> 10452.94s]  No turn them into the mana crystal
[10454.69s -> 10456.77s]  Oh, you have to have to craft it like that, huh?
[10457.73s -> 10463.49s]  Yeah, okay in here take these two life crystals. I'm being i'm being kind i'm sharing
[10464.21s -> 10465.73s]  life crystal
[10465.73s -> 10468.74s]  So that gives me another health pool
[10470.72s -> 10472.72s]  It gives you 20 health per
[10473.20s -> 10477.92s]  Why did we not do this like an hour and a half ago because you have to find them and or
[10478.48s -> 10480.72s]  It's just like random if you find it or not. Oh, okay
[10481.76s -> 10487.15s]  So we could have been looking underground for him, but clearly we didn't need it
[10487.71s -> 10489.71s]  Because we're so strong
[10490.43s -> 10492.43s]  Why does the guy have a health bar did he get hurt?
[10493.33s -> 10496.24s]  Yeah
[10496.24s -> 10499.12s]  All right. So we're gonna do anything do anything else we need to do at night time
[10500.61s -> 10501.49s]  No
[10501.49s -> 10502.53s]  um
[10502.53s -> 10504.45s]  What's your pickaxe?
[10504.45s -> 10506.37s]  Uh, it's the sand
[10506.37s -> 10508.37s]  shameful sandstone pickaxe
[10513.09s -> 10515.09s]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[10515.17s -> 10517.17s]  I have the same like you a demonite one
[10517.57s -> 10521.89s]  I mean, uh, I think I deposited them i'm depositing. I'm just putting what about the magma stuff
[10523.62s -> 10525.62s]  Uh, I don't think we have enough yet
[10525.78s -> 10528.50s]  That's what see magma ore makes a magma bar, right?
[10530.80s -> 10535.52s]  Magma factory block magma bar. You can't you can't ore mag. You can't mine magma
[10536.64s -> 10539.83s]  Or you definitely can't mine hellstone. So take that pickaxe
[10541.49s -> 10545.41s]  So this replaces this pickaxe now, I don't need this one anymore you don't need it
[10545.57s -> 10547.09s]  Okay
[10547.09s -> 10552.13s]  The sandstone pickaxe is a piece just just shell it sell it sell it garbage. All right
[10555.82s -> 10557.82s]  Do you have any more of that gingerbread?
[10559.18s -> 10560.62s]  No
[10560.62s -> 10563.20s]  the gingerbread cookie
[10563.20s -> 10564.80s]  You know the wall
[10564.80s -> 10568.29s]  What do you mean? What?
[10568.29s -> 10570.29s]  the the candy cane
[10570.85s -> 10572.85s]  It's in one of these chests
[10575.06s -> 10576.58s]  It's in one of them
[10576.58s -> 10580.58s]  I got it. I've been just like panicking and throwing stuff everything I get in here
[10582.21s -> 10585.73s]  This is superior ball of hurt in here. It's 33 melee damage. Is that good?
[10587.17s -> 10589.41s]  Okay, but it's
[10589.81s -> 10591.89s]  Okay, you you need to like fact check me here
[10592.13s -> 10595.89s]  You have to like check my work because i've just been throwing random stuff that I don't even know it does in there
[10596.53s -> 10608.10s]  So why are you making this bigger?
[10609.06s -> 10610.34s]  for this
[10610.34s -> 10613.04s]  so it's nice and even
[10613.04s -> 10615.04s]  and this is a
[10615.92s -> 10618.48s]  This is complicated. So you make one of those
[10619.20s -> 10625.36s]  And then you have to connect other storage components to it and then you click that and then it's basically a combined storage
[10628.00s -> 10630.99s]  Very cool
[10630.99s -> 10634.27s]  Very cool. Do you have any lead bars on you?
[10635.47s -> 10637.70s]  No
[10637.70s -> 10641.06s]  Like I said everything but I have two pieces of bacon on me
[10642.02s -> 10645.76s]  and like a clock
[10645.76s -> 10648.77s]  There's a new pig over here
[10648.77s -> 10652.75s]  new pig
[10652.75s -> 10654.75s]  Are we getting luigi'd right now?
[10655.22s -> 10659.94s]  Is it just spawning us pigs because hey you've been standing still for 15 straight minutes you might need a pig
[10660.50s -> 10662.66s]  They actually spawn a lot when you're above ground
[10675.25s -> 10678.53s]  Oh, dude, do you have any wood is there wood in there? You got any threes?
[10679.25s -> 10681.25s]  Dude, you got no fish
[10682.22s -> 10683.42s]  uh
[10683.42s -> 10686.62s]  So we should just go down and explore someone said just explore
[10687.66s -> 10690.16s]  Said you're doing a whole lot of nothing
[10690.32s -> 10692.32s]  I need to make this thing
[10694.35s -> 10697.86s]  And then we can do something
[10697.86s -> 10702.74s]  You just got all of that. I just like deposited that into your bank. All right. Thank you. Why don't we just go explore?
[10707.86s -> 10709.86s]  I'm going to i'm going up to hell
[10711.12s -> 10713.12s]  Going up to hell. Oh go
[10717.01s -> 10718.59s]  shooting star
[10718.59s -> 10721.15s]  Wait this fall damage uh shooting star to spell to the left
[10721.79s -> 10728.67s]  How high do you need to go?
[10728.67s -> 10732.35s]  Uh, you can actually go all the way up to like space and it'll be low gravity
[10733.15s -> 10735.15s]  What and there can still be planets up there?
[10736.11s -> 10738.11s]  Am I gonna get attacked by something?
[10738.11s -> 10739.15s]  Yes
[10739.15s -> 10740.51s]  Yes, okay

[10761.04s -> 10765.84s]  What's the thing that merlin is strong enough to pull out of the stone sword in the stone? Excalibur? It's right up here
[10767.57s -> 10770.32s]  Pull it out
[10770.32s -> 10773.14s]  How of your hand?
[10779.82s -> 10781.18s]  I I can't
[10781.18s -> 10782.70s]  Can I dig it out?
[10782.70s -> 10786.82s]  Do I have to dig it?
[10786.82s -> 10788.82s]  I do. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got
[10789.14s -> 10792.30s]  Archilus?
[10792.30s -> 10797.52s]  Oh, no
[10797.52s -> 10799.76s]  I'm falling did I use my?
[10800.00s -> 10802.00s]  No, I'm not. Oh, you got it
[10807.02s -> 10808.46s]  You oh
[10808.46s -> 10811.58s]  Can I see it? Like I think you might have found the broken weapon
[10814.59s -> 10817.79s]  I'm worried if you want if it is what I think it is. Is that it?
[10820.00s -> 10823.47s]  uh
[10823.47s -> 10825.47s]  Okay. No, this is not what I thought it was
[10828.22s -> 10832.64s]  It's not it's not
[10832.64s -> 10834.72s]  It makes the thing that I thought it was
[10835.60s -> 10837.36s]  But it is not that thing
[10837.36s -> 10842.64s]  So we just need to hold on to that. So it is the thing. It's it's like the thing. It's a it's a part to the thing
[10845.76s -> 10847.76s]  So what should I do with this
[10848.58s -> 10853.62s]  Uh, hold up. Hold on. I'm gonna explain in one second. I just went straight into the sky in love with me
[10856.40s -> 10859.28s]  That was just a random shot. I just went right in the air. Did it come over here?
[10861.62s -> 10865.06s]  You right click on the green thing the green cross. Yes
[10865.70s -> 10871.46s]  And you get that's our super storage that has 160 slots and you can search the name of things, okay
[10872.58s -> 10876.90s]  You just put everything in there. So take everything from these chests is just going in there
[10877.62s -> 10881.94s]  Yeah, if you don't know what something is just dumping it just dump them
[10882.74s -> 10884.74s]  Just dump it. Okay
[10891.50s -> 10894.78s]  Use the fucking sword. Holy shit, man. Who is streaming out of my okay?
[10905.18s -> 10907.82s]  Actually most items that we're not already using you can sell
[10908.78s -> 10913.25s]  It's like a lot of junk like mandible bow and ice blades
[10915.55s -> 10917.55s]  If you look at an item actually
[10918.94s -> 10924.54s]  All the weapons that can be crafted into other weapons say material on them. If it doesn't say material then just sell it
[10925.50s -> 10928.46s]  Uh, I i've just i'm just depositing everything in here
[10929.66s -> 10931.66s]  Okay, you know, that's fine, too
[10932.22s -> 10934.86s]  So arkylus should I use it?
[10935.74s -> 10937.74s]  Is it i'm not like melee person though
[10938.70s -> 10940.06s]  You shouldn't
[10940.06s -> 10941.42s]  I shouldn't
[10941.42s -> 10944.70s]  Should not don't get self-conscious because your chat tells you to do something
[10944.70s -> 10946.54s]  I remember when they told me to use doors
[10946.54s -> 10949.66s]  They remember when they said the problem with those rooms was that there weren't doors
[10950.14s -> 10955.90s]  I mean, we're talking about a literal 100 unanimous. Everyone is saying yes at the same time
[10958.06s -> 10960.59s]  You don't what?
[10960.59s -> 10962.90s]  Why am I not going to use this?
[10962.90s -> 10965.70s]  No, just don't even use it. Do you see how fast this is?
[10966.26s -> 10967.78s]  Don't use this
[10967.78s -> 10969.71s]  I think chat
[10969.71s -> 10976.19s]  Like if chat's not okay with the the dig the thing to hell. I don't think they can be okay with you using that sword
[10976.27s -> 10978.27s]  You're a mage, right?
[10981.46s -> 10986.21s]  Yeah, I mean that's so fast
[10989.84s -> 10991.84s]  I feel like I would kill things in two seconds
[10994.69s -> 10997.25s]  Oh, i'm gonna play with my new toy outside. This is great
[10998.21s -> 11002.24s]  All right. What are we doing? You want to go you want to go exploring?
[11003.04s -> 11008.08s]  Yes
[11008.16s -> 11011.36s]  Okay, you know how fast yeah, you know how fast i'll be able to kill the pig with this
[11013.06s -> 11030.48s]  I'll show you
[11030.48s -> 11032.48s]  You don't want to use this
[11032.48s -> 11035.50s]  You you can do whatever you want
[11035.50s -> 11039.98s]  I'm gonna use it sometimes
[11039.98s -> 11050.11s]  This would be my close range. But all right, uh, let's let's go explore. Let's go do something
[11050.83s -> 11056.83s]  I've been kind of i've been really just housebound here for the last like 20 minutes. We're we're going to go look for
[11059.42s -> 11062.22s]  Uh life crystals and just chest
[11062.86s -> 11065.10s]  Life crystals and chests should we fall all the way down?
[11066.43s -> 11070.67s]  Or stop like stop and then go to the other half way. It's like you catch up to me
[11071.47s -> 11078.11s]  actually
[11078.11s -> 11081.87s]  The crab guy's in this area, which is the next boss we would be doing
[11083.07s -> 11086.08s]  But we would need
[11086.08s -> 11090.88s]  A way to breathe underwater
[11090.96s -> 11093.90s]  I think we had gills potions
[11093.90s -> 11095.02s]  Did we?
[11095.02s -> 11098.10s]  Well, you know, oh I went by you. Oh stop falling
[11100.16s -> 11102.16s]  Actually come back up. Yeah, we'll start here
[11104.26s -> 11107.18s]  Left or right matter
[11107.18s -> 11112.59s]  Just going in left. This is a gold portal
[11113.76s -> 11116.24s]  Luke get
[11116.24s -> 11117.60s]  That's my thing
[11117.60s -> 11119.60s]  I see up there this thing
[11120.51s -> 11123.71s]  This is a life crystal you mine it and then you use the life crystal
[11124.19s -> 11126.50s]  Oh
[11126.50s -> 11128.90s]  Oh
[11128.90s -> 11135.20s]  So they just randomly around here. Yeah, they're just they're just out and about
[11136.82s -> 11139.06s]  Damn, um actually also with these mods
[11140.34s -> 11143.22s]  Actually, no, we need to get the max health first before we do that. Oh never mind
[11143.70s -> 11149.46s]  I'm just gonna go this way should I there's like water over here. Is that a bad idea?
[11149.94s -> 11152.34s]  Uh, it's a bad idea to spend that much time mining
[11152.42s -> 11154.82s]  I was just digging down because there's a bunch of open area over here
[11159.71s -> 11161.71s]  You I have a spelunky potion
[11163.17s -> 11166.88s]  Don't waste that yet
[11170.67s -> 11171.87s]  I mean
[11171.87s -> 11174.27s]  It depends how long do you are how long you're gonna play?
[11175.71s -> 11178.91s]  I don't know
[11178.91s -> 11180.91s]  Because they become very useful later on
[11184.42s -> 11186.98s]  How many bombs I have a lot of bombs I think
[11187.70s -> 11191.54s]  Should I just start throwing them?
[11191.54s -> 11195.62s]  No, I I when I did the the mass depositing I got rid of all of them
[11197.01s -> 11201.62s]  Ah, let's go the same way come over here
[11202.34s -> 11210.26s]  You're underwater. I know
[11210.82s -> 11212.82s]  There's a air pocket
[11214.86s -> 11216.86s]  Where is there an air pocket?
[11216.94s -> 11218.22s]  Over here
[11218.22s -> 11220.40s]  Are we gonna drown before?
[11224.35s -> 11229.52s]  Sorry, I couldn't see it my game was a trillion degrees too dark
[11230.00s -> 11237.28s]  I'm trying degrees. Yeah, i'm out of torches. I didn't flying ahead. Oh, you're almost dead. I'm gonna fucking die
[11238.78s -> 11242.96s]  No, i'm not. I'm fine
[11242.96s -> 11245.60s]  Occasionally there's some traps. I don't know who set them up
[11246.16s -> 11248.16s]  Just don't smooth cold
[11249.73s -> 11251.73s]  Yeah, forget what that actually makes
[11251.73s -> 11259.89s]  I'm just gonna keep going this way. What there's like a little spot to drop down here
[11260.61s -> 11268.42s]  I'm not gonna drown us or anything right if I drop this down here with you
[11270.98s -> 11272.10s]  No
[11272.10s -> 11274.66s]  That's definitely not enough water to drown anybody, but it could be
[11277.12s -> 11278.72s]  Fuck dude
[11278.72s -> 11280.16s]  You all right?
[11280.16s -> 11282.32s]  Yeah, I accidentally lobbied myself
[11286.62s -> 11288.54s]  Don't get bothered
[11288.54s -> 11305.57s]  Oh shit, that's right
[11305.57s -> 11306.99s]  jest
[11306.99s -> 11308.99s]  Actually, we haven't had a blood moon yet
[11309.07s -> 11311.07s]  That holds us back from all this stuff
[11312.19s -> 11315.47s]  Silver bar jester's arrow spiked cloud in a bottle
[11316.27s -> 11320.11s]  Dad, oh dad come look at this stuff. Let's go. Look at that. I don't know what it is
[11326.37s -> 11332.21s]  Cloud in a bottle is basically one of these jump like an extra jump so you can do spin and then a
[11332.77s -> 11335.79s]  a third jump
[11335.79s -> 11338.43s]  All right. Do you want it? I just took everything
[11339.23s -> 11342.83s]  I took the cloud in the bottle. I was saying you could do you'll get more use out of it
[11349.15s -> 11350.19s]  Okay
[11350.19s -> 11360.62s]  I'm gonna have a lot of stone
[11360.62s -> 11379.94s]  It's mine frank tonight
[11386.61s -> 11387.81s]  Where are you going?
[11387.81s -> 11397.49s]  Nothing up here
[11397.49s -> 11399.57s]  Uh, so skeleton drops something over there. I think
[11400.21s -> 11420.74s]  to the right
[11420.74s -> 11422.86s]  Thank you, man
[11422.86s -> 11433.57s]  I didn't mean it that way. You're welcome. We're silver. What do you got?
[11435.10s -> 11436.78s]  Bomb, okay. I got bombs
[11436.78s -> 11441.28s]  You want to start throwing them around?
[11441.28s -> 11443.28s]  Oh, I got a runestone
[11443.36s -> 11455.20s]  Should I just stop dropping bombs? Am I muted like
[11455.92s -> 11457.52s]  I you didn't say it
[11457.52s -> 11459.52s]  whoops, uh
[11461.42s -> 11467.58s]  Sure, I was gonna have a long answer. I'm just sure well the reason why you probably shouldn't do that
[11468.06s -> 11473.10s]  But if you're going down you should just throw bombs down and then they all fall down in a line
[11473.10s -> 11475.10s]  And it's much faster than a pickaxe
[11475.26s -> 11477.26s]  There's there's
[11477.58s -> 11479.82s]  If you're like going sideways
[11480.94s -> 11483.42s]  I'm just gonna drop them down. I have like three so i'm just gonna throw them down
[11484.54s -> 11486.91s]  Okay, I hope they land on me
[11487.87s -> 11490.59s]  How much damage does the bomb do if you if it lands directly on your head?
[11491.63s -> 11496.38s]  I don't know
[11496.38s -> 11499.10s]  Not dropping bombs on my head too often like 80 maybe
[11500.06s -> 11509.17s]  Oh fuck oh my god 246 for a fall maybe
[11519.65s -> 11521.65s]  I thought you were closer
[11521.65s -> 11529.04s]  I thought you were closer. I didn't I thought there was a platform down where you were. I didn't think it was just fall. Fuck
[11530.26s -> 11532.34s]  Uh drop bombs not yourself
[11535.42s -> 11537.18s]  No
[11537.18s -> 11538.78s]  Damn it
[11538.78s -> 11540.70s]  It's okay. I got all your money. Did you?
[11541.98s -> 11543.98s]  Yeah, okay good
[11546.58s -> 11549.38s]  I don't worry soon. We're gonna be playing hardcore mode on expert
[11550.34s -> 11553.98s]  All right, everything's a figure biceps are
[11555.02s -> 11557.02s]  They used to be pretty big. All right, so
[11557.34s -> 11558.30s]  um
[11558.30s -> 11560.48s]  You keep your items though, right?
[11560.56s -> 11561.60s]  Yep
[11561.60s -> 11566.64s]  tin ore bomb
[11566.64s -> 11571.23s]  Rune dirt block and we just got such a bunch of just shit
[11581.18s -> 11583.18s]  Uh, let me put the mirror back
[11587.23s -> 11590.67s]  Don't you put the mirror back? I don't think i've even had it
[11592.70s -> 11595.87s]  Oh
[11596.59s -> 11597.87s]  Stacks
[11597.87s -> 11599.71s]  default storing
[11599.71s -> 11603.09s]  Where is it?
[11603.09s -> 11604.53s]  filter all
[11604.53s -> 11607.01s]  Just search a mirror. Oh, I can just type it
[11610.62s -> 11612.62s]  So what what does this thing do again?
[11612.78s -> 11615.90s]  It's a recall potion and I can I can I recall to you
[11616.86s -> 11619.26s]  No, no, it always goes back to your bed. Okay
[11626.58s -> 11628.58s]  All right. I'm gonna use
[11630.85s -> 11633.49s]  Where the bombs i'm gonna bring some i'm just gonna throw them down near you
[11634.21s -> 11636.69s]  You actually do have a wormhole potion so you can teleport to me
[11636.77s -> 11641.02s]  Okay
[11641.02s -> 11646.30s]  Wormhole potion what do they look like you just press m on the map then click on my icon underground
[11647.74s -> 11652.06s]  Do I have to use the potion or just does it consume one? It'll auto use the potion when you click on me
[11652.62s -> 11654.62s]  If you have one, yeah, I don't think I have one
[11655.74s -> 11661.74s]  No, I don't have one and it's in the box
[11664.11s -> 11667.46s]  Uh
[11667.46s -> 11669.62s]  I don't think we have any
[11671.25s -> 11673.25s]  Wormhole. Oh, all right. We got one. We got one
[11674.85s -> 11676.61s]  All right coming back
[11679.81s -> 11681.81s]  Okay
[11682.53s -> 11684.77s]  Okay, this is for you I got another cloud in the bottle
[11685.89s -> 11689.25s]  So that so equip this shit and now I can
[11690.05s -> 11691.41s]  double jump
[11691.41s -> 11694.21s]  Again, I have to triple one two three one two three
[11696.74s -> 11704.34s]  Very cool. All right
[11704.66s -> 11707.70s]  Is there something specific besides life crystals we're looking for here?
[11709.12s -> 11711.74s]  um chests
[11711.90s -> 11714.22s]  and life crystals that's about it red husk and
[11715.02s -> 11719.50s]  Any kind of gemstone if we come across it is also helpful because we don't have hooks yet
[11721.10s -> 11728.38s]  That's my bird i'm just safe without the bird
[11729.26s -> 11734.83s]  Oh, and we found the mushroom kingdom
[11736.66s -> 11738.66s]  Which is also helpful
[11738.66s -> 11741.34s]  Because there's a boss we can summon in here
[11741.98s -> 11743.65s]  we can
[11743.65s -> 11746.29s]  I'm like too tall if I have a glowing crystal
[11747.54s -> 11750.34s]  Or glowing mushrooms then you can summon a boss in here
[11756.80s -> 11758.96s]  chats talking politics in the chat
[11760.22s -> 11763.18s]  Stop it. Let's get political. Stop it
[11764.40s -> 11766.40s]  What about hillary's emails?
[11766.48s -> 11770.38s]  Don't act
[11770.38s -> 11773.42s]  Oh, that's a nice point you have there. But what about hillary's emails?
[11774.38s -> 11776.38s]  Oh like right above us is topaz
[11778.34s -> 11780.40s]  topaz
[11780.40s -> 11781.68s]  Yeah
[11781.68s -> 11783.68s]  15 of any gemstone gives you
[11784.08s -> 11786.08s]  A hook and hooks are very good
[11786.88s -> 11803.30s]  Where do we go now? So where should we go now down here?
[11804.10s -> 11806.66s]  I'm just placing torches. I'm holding shift
[11807.62s -> 11816.83s]  Be aware of that
[11816.91s -> 11830.62s]  You're freaking me out. I don't like this doesn't go that far
[11831.87s -> 11837.66s]  um
[11837.66s -> 11839.66s]  I hate we don't have the dryad yet
[11842.88s -> 11846.91s]  too scary
[11846.91s -> 11848.03s]  Can you do it?
[11848.03s -> 11852.03s]  Probably not mario maker. Can you do it? Oh easy. He's a pro
[11852.59s -> 11858.16s]  I played mario maker a few times so you're not you're not wrong
[11859.57s -> 11861.57s]  Should we dig down this way around here?
[11862.61s -> 11864.61s]  I feel like we're getting too low
[11865.17s -> 11868.69s]  Too low there's some really good chests that appear at this level
[11869.49s -> 11873.33s]  There's like a band that makes you immune to lava for seven seconds. Should we go this way?
[11875.62s -> 11877.86s]  Uh, how many bombs do you have a lot?
[11879.36s -> 11881.36s]  I'd just start dropping them
[11882.00s -> 11888.03s]  Okay
[11888.03s -> 11890.03s]  much faster than that
[11890.75s -> 11893.31s]  Not not one at a time you're not too worried about what's gonna happen
[11894.75s -> 11896.51s]  All right, well watch out watch out
[11896.51s -> 11915.54s]  What's that?
[11915.54s -> 11921.06s]  Uh, those combine into life crystals if you get 10 of them really how do we get it? How can we give it a lava?
[11922.10s -> 11924.66s]  Uh, just blow it up. Just keep blowing shit up
[11930.56s -> 11932.45s]  I just blew them up
[11932.45s -> 11947.57s]  They're still in there
[11947.57s -> 11950.16s]  So we're
[11950.16s -> 11952.34s]  Keep going down
[11952.34s -> 11963.01s]  Yeah
[11963.01s -> 11964.75s]  Keep doing this
[11964.75s -> 11967.07s]  Keep going. I only have like eight bombs left
[11971.79s -> 11974.27s]  All right. That's enough. Oh my god. Oh my god. What what?
[11975.87s -> 11978.59s]  I'm down there. I know but I you told me to keep doing it
[11979.39s -> 11991.74s]  Well, okay, that's enough that's enough more bomb him more
[11992.38s -> 12002.22s]  I'm gonna go this way. I don't have any bombs. Those are grenades
[12007.06s -> 12009.06s]  You like really don't like working together
[12009.78s -> 12012.59s]  We kind of like wherever I dig isn't good enough for you
[12014.59s -> 12016.59s]  It's not yeah, no, it's not
[12017.47s -> 12034.11s]  control
[12034.11s -> 12038.34s]  I did it already. I think I found something
[12039.44s -> 12040.96s]  platinum ore
[12040.96s -> 12044.51s]  platinum
[12044.51s -> 12048.43s]  Good, I don't think it's really useful for us anymore. Demonite is better and we have a lot
[12049.47s -> 12059.01s]  Did we skip everything?
[12059.01s -> 12062.27s]  All right, so we're i'm above you
[12062.35s -> 12064.03s]  So i'm in hell
[12064.03s -> 12070.59s]  Do we go back up?
[12070.59s -> 12074.94s]  uh
[12074.94s -> 12076.94s]  Yeah, I have a lot of stuff I can put away
[12078.40s -> 12082.75s]  How do we sum up the next boss?
[12083.79s -> 12088.16s]  That's how hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on
[12099.73s -> 12104.93s]  Uh, we could go to the beach and fight the giant jellyfish, which I don't even give us anything beach we need
[12105.89s -> 12109.95s]  It's all the way on the left side of the map very very long walk
[12116.62s -> 12118.62s]  And it will be a pain in the neck
[12121.86s -> 12125.14s]  Wait, what's going on people arguing in chat sub only?
[12125.86s -> 12127.54s]  Oh, I know what we can do
[12127.54s -> 12142.29s]  We should be discussing terraria strategies
[12153.42s -> 12158.77s]  One moment, then I have a plan go caving
[12161.70s -> 12165.30s]  We just did some caving didn't we just go caving
[12174.22s -> 12175.66s]  camera mode
[12177.52s -> 12179.92s]  All right, should I just get rid of this book? I feel like i'm not using it at all
[12181.89s -> 12183.68s]  Uh, sure
[12183.68s -> 12189.12s]  You're gonna, you know, stop using things a lot and you don't have to ask my permission. Yeah, but yeah
[12190.24s -> 12192.24s]  I know but you're the most
[12192.72s -> 12195.20s]  You're the most addressable person right now
[12195.76s -> 12198.24s]  Okay, you know what? I understand. I apologize for being
[12200.72s -> 12202.72s]  Abrasive
[12202.72s -> 12204.72s]  You're very abrasive right now
[12206.08s -> 12208.08s]  Hey, what video is that from?
[12208.56s -> 12215.34s]  Hey get that a star right there you're gonna get that star
[12216.06s -> 12222.43s]  I'm selling something
[12222.43s -> 12226.03s]  I am gonna get that and i'm gonna use it because I think I have three now because I have one
[12226.75s -> 12228.35s]  star
[12228.35s -> 12242.08s]  No, I have two
[12242.08s -> 12246.96s]  Two enemies are nearby. What are these uh, two like tesla, uh cannon things?
[12249.34s -> 12254.46s]  Uh one is so you can make furniture out of snow and one is so you can make stuff out of slime
[12255.34s -> 12257.22s]  or gel
[12257.22s -> 12259.54s]  How do I take it off? So how do you take a room off sub only?
[12262.21s -> 12264.21s]  Slash subscribers, I think
[12271.42s -> 12280.56s]  How do I turn it off subscribers off why does it feel like that means I delete everybody
[12282.61s -> 12286.53s]  Subscribers are subscribers are removed from the channel
[12299.52s -> 12302.56s]  Hey, hey, wait, what did it? What did my wife say?
[12306.51s -> 12307.95s]  Where's uh
[12307.95s -> 12309.31s]  Where is it?
[12309.31s -> 12312.27s]  Here I have three things for you. How the fuck do I do this?
[12313.07s -> 12317.33s]  I don't even know how to like I don't even know how to fucking turn it off on my own damn channel
[12318.21s -> 12322.50s]  Am I about to google how to turn off sub only and get mods?
[12329.20s -> 12331.20s]  Don't tell him how to do that
[12332.70s -> 12344.75s]  Yeah, i'm searching for it. Okay, how to turn off sub only twitch
[12346.96s -> 12348.96s]  How do you turn off sub only chat?
[12351.25s -> 12354.90s]  It's likely visual bug
[12355.20s -> 12357.44s]  Subscribers off they would write
[12357.52s -> 12359.60s]  All right, everybody behave yourselves
[12360.83s -> 12362.83s]  I somebody did
[12364.94s -> 12369.13s]  Behave
[12369.13s -> 12372.17s]  Don't no more. I don't want to I don't hear about any politics talk
[12374.68s -> 12376.68s]  Don't let star talk about like
[12377.26s -> 12378.94s]  hillary's emails
[12378.94s -> 12384.86s]  Germa thinks his stream is more important than the future of america. I don't want to hear about the damn emails anymore. Okay?
[12385.66s -> 12389.60s]  The whole entire country is sick of hearing about your email talk about
[12390.08s -> 12394.40s]  This importance of all of our futures and where it's headed talk about me instead
[12395.92s -> 12398.40s]  All right. So wait, what are we doing? What's what's going on?
[12407.21s -> 12408.97s]  two one
[12408.97s -> 12412.25s]  Zero the countdown come to the right. All right. Are you summoning a boss?
[12413.05s -> 12417.37s]  Uh, there's two bosses. We're gonna fight two bosses. Are you gonna summon those bosses two summoning stones?
[12417.77s -> 12420.49s]  Straight above us is a planet with a giant bee in it. Got it
[12421.45s -> 12423.82s]  Okay, so go up
[12425.02s -> 12429.98s]  Uh, did you take all the ropes that I had I had like a thousand where we're going up we're going up bone rope
[12430.78s -> 12433.72s]  this is uh
[12434.84s -> 12436.84s]  Ah, you wouldn't appreciate that
[12437.32s -> 12440.27s]  I just threw up a bomb in here
[12444.17s -> 12446.17s]  I'm helping i'm helping i'm helping i'm helping
[12447.72s -> 12450.44s]  Okay. So once we dig inside of this, yeah
[12451.40s -> 12453.64s]  Of the bee queen or whatever will spawn
[12457.29s -> 12459.13s]  This is a bee queen
[12459.13s -> 12462.17s]  She's similar to the bird we fought where she dashes left and right at you
[12462.65s -> 12464.65s]  But also she shoots a lot of things. Hey
[12465.85s -> 12474.04s]  Okay, so okay. So we're probably going to fight her
[12475.42s -> 12478.16s]  on the ground
[12478.16s -> 12480.16s]  So go down after we summon
[12481.60s -> 12483.60s]  Yeah, or fight her on the rope
[12490.70s -> 12492.70s]  Well, I don't if you want to fight her on the rope
[12493.42s -> 12495.50s]  Queen bee is spun. All right, so just be careful, right?
[12496.38s -> 12502.41s]  It's just like contra
[12502.41s -> 12503.85s]  She's gonna hurt
[12503.85s -> 12506.35s]  There's a contra level just like this
[12519.10s -> 12521.10s]  All right. Well, she's
[12521.18s -> 12522.62s]  Oh
[12522.62s -> 12530.92s]  Add a mana add a mana
[12534.65s -> 12536.97s]  What okay, I guess the best you can do is stand still
[12537.93s -> 12540.09s]  I'll wait for you. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good
[12540.97s -> 12546.97s]  I got mana back
[12547.45s -> 12550.33s]  I think you would get a lot of enjoyment from the bee items
[12551.90s -> 12553.90s]  ow fuck
[12554.70s -> 12557.90s]  Hold on I can potion in four seconds
[12558.78s -> 12560.14s]  That's a lie
[12560.14s -> 12571.34s]  I just missed don't die. Oh my god
[12573.18s -> 12575.18s]  I
[12591.18s -> 12593.18s]  It just I need mana
[12593.50s -> 12595.50s]  I run out of mana that I just
[12595.96s -> 12600.84s]  Stick my fingers in my eyes. I gave you a fucking musket. This doesn't cost mana
[12604.97s -> 12608.49s]  Okay, actually, no, this is this is what you want. Trust me. I think you're gonna love this
[12609.82s -> 12611.26s]  Take this
[12611.26s -> 12615.44s]  We're going step by step take this as long as you're shooting wooden arrows
[12615.52s -> 12620.80s]  So like make sure your your ammo on the right isn't like flaming arrows or something. You shoot a line of bees
[12621.60s -> 12628.44s]  I'm gonna get as much did you pick up my money?
[12629.63s -> 12630.75s]  I did
[12630.75s -> 12640.64s]  Okay, jerma
[12640.64s -> 12643.52s]  I'm not done with yes. What is it? I'm paying attention
[12644.16s -> 12648.56s]  Take this i'm downloading an entire class into my brain in the first day of school
[12649.20s -> 12655.20s]  Okay, jerma take you're the teacher and i'm sitting in a fucking chair and hey, welcome to the first day. Here's the syllabus
[12655.28s -> 12664.80s]  Oh, by the way, uh, here's every single test do it now. It's a lot jerma. It's a lot. I know
[12665.60s -> 12674.38s]  All right, what do you want me to do with this as long as that's in your inventory other bees are friendly to you
[12674.46s -> 12678.86s]  Which is only in the jungle. It's up to you if you want to waste inventory space on it. I'll keep it
[12679.34s -> 12681.34s]  Okay, and this you take this
[12681.82s -> 12683.82s]  If you get hit bees come out of you
[12686.20s -> 12687.56s]  All right
[12687.56s -> 12689.08s]  Okay, and this
[12689.08s -> 12695.40s]  What do you get hit it feels damaged everything around you which will actually hit every segment of a worm. It's pretty good early
[12696.28s -> 12699.23s]  Okay, take this
[12699.87s -> 12702.03s]  That'll increase your minion damage where
[12704.60s -> 12706.70s]  Okay
[12706.70s -> 12709.90s]  Equip material equipment equipable. Where does it equip to?
[12710.86s -> 12712.30s]  uh
[12712.30s -> 12715.20s]  Underneath the armor the slots are all for accessories
[12717.90s -> 12720.52s]  And I think that's it
[12720.52s -> 12722.52s]  I would highly recommend use of that bow
[12723.00s -> 12725.32s]  Uh, um, yeah, i'm gonna i think i'm gonna give it a try
[12725.96s -> 12732.20s]  Especially because all these once they come out they become homing and they just follow everything and then you just like you can read your chat
[12732.28s -> 12734.28s]  And become a boomer
[12741.92s -> 12743.92s]  So, what what does it use for um
[12744.67s -> 12748.03s]  For wooden arrows turned into a column of vehicles wooden arrows
[12748.75s -> 12750.99s]  So I don't need I don't need like cobweb anymore
[12752.80s -> 12757.84s]  Uh cobweb turns into rope. You might as well just turn it all into a rope. Okay, so I need wooden arrows
[12759.85s -> 12761.85s]  You know here I have 400
[12762.64s -> 12766.00s]  Okay, i'll take 400 arrows you're gonna want more let me check
[12766.08s -> 12768.08s]  Let me test this out
[12775.02s -> 12781.04s]  They're saying you didn't get the money
[12781.04s -> 12783.36s]  I have 21 gold. Oh, there is gold over there
[12792.25s -> 12795.93s]  Yeah, you can just have it that that that's like that's like my like fuck face fee
[12796.01s -> 12798.41s]  You know what I mean? Like that's yours. Like I you could have it
[12799.21s -> 12807.98s]  What okay, but queen bee
[12808.38s -> 12811.42s]  Discouraged the giant insects are they can prove useful in certain situations?
[12812.30s -> 12815.96s]  Giving the ability to control them placing your image and make all small bees weak
[12817.08s -> 12821.88s]  All small bees and weak hornets friendly. I have two of these though. I don't do I need does it make them extra friendly?
[12821.96s -> 12823.96s]  Oh, no. No, you don't need both
[12824.12s -> 12828.20s]  And again bees really only exist in the jungle, but it's probably a waste inventory spot
[12828.28s -> 12831.64s]  But I thought you know, maybe you'd get into the whole bee thing. So what's a strange plant?
[12833.16s -> 12835.16s]  Uh garbage
[12838.89s -> 12840.49s]  bee nade
[12840.49s -> 12850.06s]  All right, that's kind of cool
[12850.06s -> 12851.02s]  feather
[12851.02s -> 12853.02s]  Deposit this stuff avian cartilage
[12853.82s -> 12856.64s]  Do you have any more? Um stars
[12858.75s -> 12861.18s]  I have one
[12861.18s -> 12863.26s]  You can trade the strange plant for dye. That's cool
[12866.11s -> 12868.11s]  You have one can I have it or do you need it?
[12868.11s -> 12870.11s]  Uh, it's daytime. I can't give it to you
[12870.97s -> 12872.25s]  oh
[12872.25s -> 12879.36s]  Right. I don't think i'm gonna use
[12880.08s -> 12881.92s]  Maybe I will
[12881.92s -> 12883.92s]  No, i'll use this i'll try it
[12885.71s -> 12888.73s]  Try what?
[12888.73s -> 12890.73s]  That bow if you're not gonna use it
[12891.13s -> 12895.69s]  I'll use the bow but i'm talking about the vine. Should I get to replace the bow with the vine?
[12896.25s -> 12898.97s]  You know what I mean? What's the vine? Oh vile thorn. Yeah
[12901.26s -> 12906.54s]  Nah, keep vile thorn keep vile thorn and just when you run out of mana just shoot bees
[12907.50s -> 12916.30s]  What do I do with it?
[12916.30s -> 12918.22s]  I guess i'll put it up here
[12918.22s -> 12924.03s]  I like dark wave though. I like the dot
[12926.00s -> 12928.00s]  Uh, I think magma ore
[12928.16s -> 12930.64s]  Actually makes them a good fire spell
[12931.76s -> 12934.51s]  I think we actually have enough to do it
[12934.83s -> 12940.32s]  So what's next on the agenda?
[12940.32s -> 12943.52s]  You can hear me, right? Yeah
[12943.68s -> 12946.11s]  Okay, i'm gonna make you this
[12946.11s -> 12960.67s]  spam
[12960.67s -> 12962.67s]  Never mind. I don't know how to make it
[12963.07s -> 12965.82s]  Let me ask jeffery
[12965.82s -> 12968.62s]  Jeff, how do you do this? It might be hellstone actually
[12971.26s -> 12976.54s]  I wonder if I get hellstone. Let me look at this again. Okay, five percent increase minion knockback damage
[12977.58s -> 12983.63s]  So it regenerates health. I want like a i've won a bunch of mana regeneration
[12985.55s -> 12987.55s]  Uh, then we need to find the meteorite
[12993.10s -> 12996.70s]  Because that gives you an armor set that reduces the cost of spells mana
[12997.74s -> 12999.74s]  And gives extra magic damage
[13002.20s -> 13005.88s]  All right, I just send it flying. All right. Well, what what's the second boss that you wanted to do?
[13007.37s -> 13010.41s]  Uh, we have to go back to the corruption. There's another boss we can fight there
[13011.37s -> 13014.72s]  You wanna do it?
[13014.72s -> 13016.56s]  Can I pee first? Yeah
[13016.56s -> 13020.56s]  Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Why don't you it's been like four hours. Why don't you go on a pee break, too?
[13021.20s -> 13027.92s]  No, i've never peed before. Okay. How how often do you like when you stream how long do you stream usually?
[13028.96s -> 13032.72s]  Like five or six hours lately six hours like maybe five to eight hours something like that
[13033.28s -> 13038.08s]  Yeah, how many times do you go pee in like a seven and a half hours? I don't I don't get up
[13038.32s -> 13040.32s]  You do not get up. I don't
[13041.28s -> 13043.36s]  I've had like 12 hour streams where i've not peed
[13044.08s -> 13045.76s]  Are you drinking water?
[13045.76s -> 13049.76s]  Yes, ever since I was a child. It's one of my you know, one of my past times you go to the toilet
[13050.08s -> 13055.52s]  You have to make sure you remember to count how long you're peeing. I've told you this before. I know I have yeah told everyone
[13056.96s -> 13058.96s]  What's your longest pee?
[13059.04s -> 13061.04s]  my longest pee ever
[13061.36s -> 13064.80s]  Well, it was probably like it was probably like 45 seconds and then it stopped
[13065.36s -> 13069.92s]  And then I thought it was over and then another full like probably 35 seconds
[13071.12s -> 13073.28s]  after stoppage like stopping
[13074.56s -> 13079.48s]  For at least five straight seconds, then it doesn't count. No, it does. It's the same. It's actually continuous
[13080.44s -> 13082.44s]  That's the same session. You don't leave the urinal
[13084.11s -> 13089.63s]  Well, see because the problem then becomes if if you're allowed to stop then a whole bunch of people would be stopped start
[13089.79s -> 13093.63s]  Stop, and then you get like an extended. Well, that doesn't happen all the time. That's only happening like twice
[13093.63s -> 13096.22s]  continuously
[13096.22s -> 13101.58s]  My the longest pee i've ever had it continuously where i've just been looking down going what the fuck is happening
[13102.54s -> 13103.90s]  Whoa
[13103.90s -> 13105.90s]  was
[13106.30s -> 13111.10s]  No, you you have that reaction because where does it go if you pee for 60 straight seconds
[13111.82s -> 13113.98s]  How what where is that shit inside you?
[13115.18s -> 13118.22s]  Your bladder is not that big you're peeing out like a whole body full of pee
[13119.56s -> 13123.40s]  That's like two 32 ounce gatorade bottles like that can't fit in there
[13124.36s -> 13128.24s]  You're right i'm laughing because you're right
[13130.62s -> 13135.42s]  Uh, probably like I don't know 50 60 seconds, maybe tops you can't go for that long
[13136.38s -> 13139.39s]  But uh, all right, whatever i'll be right back
[13140.11s -> 13142.48s]  Give me a second and tell me more
[13143.28s -> 13146.75s]  I'm gonna be muted on my stream, but not on your stream
[13147.31s -> 13149.31s]  Okay, yes, I when we hear the okay
[13149.95s -> 13157.88s]  BRB
[13157.88s -> 13163.26s]  Well, it's just me and you guys
[13164.06s -> 13178.48s]  Okay, okay, I understand I understand okay, I understand it's all clear now
[13355.74s -> 13362.28s]  All right, just out of the way unmute you or prison, uh, dude
[13363.32s -> 13365.63s]  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello
[13366.57s -> 13368.57s]  Hi, hello. Hello. Hello
[13369.13s -> 13372.14s]  Hello
[13372.14s -> 13377.98s]  All right. So what have you got done in the my absence? Oh you made like I made some rooms
[13378.94s -> 13382.06s]  You made a little another section. This is a science section
[13384.16s -> 13386.16s]  indeed
[13386.16s -> 13390.59s]  Okay. All right. You ready?
[13390.59s -> 13393.79s]  I'm gonna head out. I guess yeah, what do you want to do the other boss?
[13394.51s -> 13396.35s]  other boss
[13396.35s -> 13398.35s]  other boss
[13403.84s -> 13406.48s]  What is this one is the jellyfish boss you're talking about
[13407.44s -> 13408.72s]  No
[13408.72s -> 13410.88s]  This boss is the hive mind
[13414.48s -> 13415.36s]  So
[13415.36s -> 13419.69s]  Is it big? Is it cool? Is it scary?
[13421.04s -> 13423.04s]  Uh, it's kind of a blob
[13423.60s -> 13427.28s]  And then you destroy the blob and then there's a phase two and then it's a floating blob
[13429.27s -> 13431.27s]  introduction of uh faces
[13433.48s -> 13435.48s]  I've seen that before
[13435.56s -> 13440.11s]  It's obviously you cannot defeat reddit
[13443.68s -> 13446.80s]  Well, I would agree normally that guess you cannot defeat reddit
[13447.76s -> 13449.76s]  What about hillary's email?
[13455.36s -> 13460.16s]  We had we had we had moved on it was already over we had moved on from that
[13461.12s -> 13464.59s]  Because all right, you do realize that when you say that
[13465.39s -> 13467.39s]  Everyone like laughs like oh
[13468.83s -> 13470.43s]  Yeah
[13470.43s -> 13472.43s]  Yeah, that was but what about them though?
[13474.78s -> 13478.30s]  And then it's just and then it just becomes like a politics chat
[13480.44s -> 13486.28s]  Well, then then you have to look deep within yourself again and figure out if you're more important than the future of america
[13487.16s -> 13489.16s]  And then if you should stifle the conversation
[13491.24s -> 13494.04s]  I guess yes. I apologize for restarting it
[13498.62s -> 13502.43s]  Okay, we're in the corruption. We are looking for remember
[13502.43s -> 13506.91s]  There's that thing on the ground before and you're like, what's this? And I was like don't shoot it. It's a cyst
[13507.39s -> 13509.39s]  It grows on the ground
[13511.31s -> 13513.95s]  And then when we destroy that it summons the boss and I hope we can beat it
[13515.07s -> 13518.43s]  That's kind of how it goes. So would you say would you say it is some kind of?
[13519.47s -> 13521.47s]  sis lord
[13521.63s -> 13525.79s]  I don't get a reference. You've never seen
[13528.72s -> 13531.63s]  Like a sith lord
[13531.63s -> 13533.63s]  Like like a star. Oh, here's one
[13534.59s -> 13535.63s]  Yes
[13535.63s -> 13537.63s]  Like don't die, please
[13538.03s -> 13540.03s]  I'm but I need I need help
[13540.88s -> 13543.36s]  I'm not I don't think i'm capable of doing this on my own make ropes
[13544.00s -> 13546.00s]  I don't think I have any you took them all
[13546.08s -> 13548.60s]  Well, no, no, no
[13548.60s -> 13564.86s]  I'm good. Okay. I don't know. I'm fine. Help me
[13565.82s -> 13567.82s]  Help me climb this hole
[13570.06s -> 13572.24s]  I don't want to hear about those emails
[13572.24s -> 13577.21s]  All right, are you ready? What do you mean? Are we gonna go up go up when it first spawns?
[13577.29s -> 13579.69s]  It's like stationary. I'm just gonna chuck bombs at it
[13582.06s -> 13584.06s]  Just chuck but I have like b bombs
[13589.00s -> 13591.08s]  So are we fighting this in any particular place?
[13592.92s -> 13594.84s]  um
[13594.84s -> 13596.76s]  Just around
[13596.76s -> 13597.98s]  Okay
[13597.98s -> 13599.98s]  And its move set is
[13601.45s -> 13603.45s]  I honestly don't know. It's really
[13604.01s -> 13607.85s]  It's like the lamest move set of any boss and doesn't really do anything
[13608.81s -> 13622.72s]  Whoa, you came out of here you see it's just kind of there now is the second phase
[13622.72s -> 13624.72s]  I think it does what the brain does
[13626.24s -> 13630.88s]  Like teleports around and then comes at you again, but never gets near you
[13632.64s -> 13635.26s]  And it goes
[13636.86s -> 13656.38s]  Ohio I think that's what it's saying which is uh, well, you know why a lot of damage numbers
[13673.84s -> 13675.12s]  Okay
[13675.12s -> 13677.12s]  How would you explain this move set?
[13678.88s -> 13681.36s]  Now that you've seen it you like get like I didn't know what to say
[13682.00s -> 13686.08s]  What the move set? Yeah, like you said once it's move set and I didn't know what to say
[13687.82s -> 13689.82s]  Uh, yeah, it's just kind of
[13690.86s -> 13693.58s]  It just it just kind of exists and moves around the circle
[13694.30s -> 13695.26s]  Yeah
[13695.26s -> 13698.38s]  And then something it turns into another thing that moves around the circle
[13699.26s -> 13700.46s]  Yep
[13700.46s -> 13701.66s]  That's the one
[13701.66s -> 13707.02s]  It gives us a true shadow scales which you can craft with demonite bars and I do not remember what it makes
[13707.66s -> 13709.66s]  It's not at all hive mine
[13711.96s -> 13716.36s]  So did you did you get anything interesting? I didn't really get I got like this. I just got
[13717.24s -> 13719.48s]  I got true shadow scales for crafting and
[13720.20s -> 13721.56s]  throwing weapons
[13721.56s -> 13726.12s]  Place in your inventory for all your projectiles to inflict cursed flames when in the corruption
[13727.24s -> 13732.49s]  the hive mine
[13732.49s -> 13737.29s]  Wait all projectiles in the crump. That's pretty cool. Yeah, as long as you're in this area, so like
[13738.17s -> 13742.97s]  So does that have to be like in my hot bar or just in my backpack in your inventory anywhere? Okay
[13744.09s -> 13747.77s]  So when I shoot somebody with this they get like burnt. Well, that's awesome. Yeah
[13748.97s -> 13750.49s]  That's pretty good
[13750.49s -> 13756.48s]  Are we good? Is this another one? Yeah, let's do one more
[13758.04s -> 13760.76s]  Just in case shadow skills do make something good because I don't remember
[13761.64s -> 13788.89s]  Oh god, i'm stuck down here. It's tim allen noise
[13789.85s -> 13814.48s]  Is it though kind of is I think we need to go
[13815.87s -> 13816.99s]  go
[13816.99s -> 13818.91s]  To the beach
[13818.91s -> 13821.92s]  Did he drop would drop something?
[13821.92s -> 13826.16s]  Uh, he dropped a staff for you. It's pretty decent. Did he here?
[13826.88s -> 13828.88s]  Let me see that thing
[13829.20s -> 13832.88s]  Shadow drop staff. I think that's not what I thought it was actually
[13833.84s -> 13839.02s]  Summons dark or rain from the sky
[13843.40s -> 13845.40s]  Let him get the drops. I I should
[13847.88s -> 13849.08s]  So just
[13849.08s -> 13851.08s]  It's just a rain projectile
[13851.16s -> 13853.16s]  Yeah, all those bullets deal damage
[13853.96s -> 13856.92s]  That's actually that's pretty good. I think i'd rather have this than um
[13860.19s -> 13867.15s]  There's there's one of those that you can make with a hellstone which we can mine down in hell except the projectiles go through the ground
[13868.11s -> 13870.83s]  So because like if you're underground that rain doesn't do anything
[13872.03s -> 13874.03s]  Oh, really?
[13874.35s -> 13877.71s]  Well, it'll come from the top of your screen. It's also kind of hard to see
[13878.67s -> 13880.84s]  I can't really tell like exactly where it's going
[13881.32s -> 13886.57s]  I think it's just because where you are in the background is purple. All right, so we're just porting back, right?
[13887.53s -> 13888.49s]  Yeah
[13888.49s -> 13903.63s]  I love watching derma progress in this game from an insignificant caterpillar to a big beautiful slightly more competent caterpillar
[13905.37s -> 13907.45s]  Okay, i've got the i've got the real deal for you
[13909.28s -> 13911.28s]  Yeah, I guess
[13912.80s -> 13915.36s]  You got the real deal for me
[13915.76s -> 13919.18s]  I gotta hold on
[13919.18s -> 13922.44s]  Uh, did you ever give me that star?
[13922.44s -> 13926.44s]  Nope, I have five of them now I can ask you
[13928.12s -> 13929.80s]  I thought you can't do that
[13929.80s -> 13931.80s]  You can do that with the blue ones. Oh
[13933.05s -> 13937.29s]  All right. What I need to change my hot bar a little bit here. This is kind of a mess
[13940.19s -> 13942.04s]  I fuked up
[13942.04s -> 13944.04s]  You have to crap. These are the demon altar
[13944.96s -> 13946.96s]  I forget that every time
[13947.12s -> 13950.72s]  So should I just be putting my gold in here too in the big box?
[13955.18s -> 13957.18s]  Uh, yes, no reason not to
[13957.26s -> 13963.56s]  I'm gonna make some more torches
[13963.56s -> 13965.08s]  And all right
[13965.08s -> 13967.72s]  I think it's time to make a change here
[13971.31s -> 13973.31s]  I gotta go make you an item. So i'll be back
[13977.90s -> 13979.90s]  This is called I like this b thing
[13981.29s -> 13983.37s]  This can just it's a one use essentially
[13984.73s -> 13992.99s]  Keep the apples over here
[13994.27s -> 13996.51s]  All right, I like that little setup
[13997.15s -> 13999.15s]  If you press the item in an empty space
[14000.43s -> 14002.43s]  So you don't have to put it in the hot bar
[14004.44s -> 14012.54s]  If you believe me like if I just if I click this it'll just use it
[14021.15s -> 14023.74s]  Thank god. He's learning it
[14023.74s -> 14025.74s]  No, click outside of the inventory
[14028.08s -> 14030.08s]  Oh, I see. Okay. I see what you mean
[14031.87s -> 14033.87s]  So if I click on let's say this I just
[14035.63s -> 14037.74s]  No, hello
[14037.74s -> 14041.07s]  To use items like the mirror you don't need to put them in your hot bar instead
[14041.07s -> 14044.43s]  You pick them up from your inventory then left click outside
[14045.23s -> 14047.15s]  Oh cool
[14047.85s -> 14050.33s]  So hold on for instance like a healing potion I just
[14051.13s -> 14053.85s]  All right. I get you. I get you. I get you. I got it. I got you
[14054.65s -> 14056.03s]  This is lady
[14056.03s -> 14066.27s]  I'm gonna make some more rope
[14067.63s -> 14069.63s]  And some more torches
[14070.60s -> 14072.60s]  Did you figure out what you could do with the uh?
[14073.24s -> 14076.60s]  Stuff that we just made i'll be back in a second. I'm making the stuff for you
[14077.64s -> 14079.64s]  Making the stuff for you
[14080.48s -> 14081.60s]  Thanks
[14081.60s -> 14084.09s]  You know how sometimes I have trouble
[14085.52s -> 14087.52s]  You're a real friend here
[14088.00s -> 14090.72s]  Uh, take this it's a new summon. It's not a bird
[14092.30s -> 14094.35s]  and this
[14094.35s -> 14096.91s]  uh
[14096.91s -> 14099.87s]  This and this dank creeper to fight for you and then yeah
[14100.19s -> 14102.19s]  Yeah, get the freaking dank creeper
[14102.35s -> 14107.39s]  So can I have can I use both these to get like together with the bird and the dank you have one minion slot?
[14108.88s -> 14111.05s]  What's better bird or dank?
[14111.05s -> 14113.93s]  Uh dank is better. They their type of summons
[14115.21s -> 14117.21s]  Seeks out enemies a little bit better
[14117.21s -> 14120.17s]  Their AI is better even though their damage is not that different
[14121.05s -> 14123.05s]  so what's the dark wave or
[14124.23s -> 14126.23s]  Shadarian stuff
[14127.45s -> 14130.73s]  Shade rain shade rain. Yeah, come use that outside
[14132.09s -> 14134.09s]  I want to make sure what I think
[14137.96s -> 14142.11s]  okay, yeah, so you have you have one minion slot and
[14143.85s -> 14145.93s]  I think those count as a sentry slot
[14148.48s -> 14150.96s]  Yeah, so you can have two sentries in the clouds count as sentries
[14150.96s -> 14153.12s]  So they just kind of sit there and they they pour rain
[14153.12s -> 14158.96s]  So if like there's a boss just you know, get those clouds above it and does a lot of damage because each drop is a projectile
[14159.04s -> 14160.56s]  So what the hell does it?
[14160.56s -> 14163.36s]  Someone's a dank creeper to fight. Where's my dank creeper?
[14163.44s -> 14168.16s]  You have to go to the top left and unsummon your bird to be able to summon something new. Oh, okay
[14170.96s -> 14173.52s]  And that thing's better just the stuff. Oh, yeah clouds are
[14174.08s -> 14176.00s]  My never mind
[14176.00s -> 14178.30s]  So I'm gonna have two clouds out at the same time
[14179.02s -> 14181.36s]  Yep
[14181.36s -> 14183.60s]  I don't like this this thing moves around too much. She's annoying
[14188.80s -> 14193.36s]  All right. I guess i'll just be place stuff and aoe guy
[14196.76s -> 14198.76s]  And I have the b thing. Okay
[14201.16s -> 14203.16s]  All right. Um, I think i'm good to
[14204.43s -> 14208.75s]  We can fight the slime god, but i'm not sure if we're ready
[14210.49s -> 14212.49s]  Don't know if you're ready to fight the slime god
[14212.73s -> 14215.10s]  What do I have potions?
[14217.66s -> 14222.84s]  Hmm
[14222.84s -> 14232.96s]  That's enough you should place down clouds and switch to your other weapons. Don't need to unequip your other staff
[14234.48s -> 14237.02s]  Yeah, that's true
[14237.02s -> 14239.05s]  That's very true
[14239.05s -> 14241.05s]  So essentially it's my rotation would be
[14242.25s -> 14243.37s]  uh
[14243.37s -> 14246.60s]  like two
[14246.60s -> 14248.60s]  two three four
[14250.70s -> 14252.70s]  Yeah, okay, and then five
[14258.24s -> 14260.24s]  Because this would be a setting up. Hold on. Let me see
[14261.56s -> 14265.80s]  I don't know
[14265.80s -> 14270.44s]  Get the clouds out switch to here throw it out there get it out bang bang bang
[14271.00s -> 14275.32s]  Wait for the overpower to proc get it guaranteed crit switch back inner rage
[14276.44s -> 14279.53s]  Okay, bang bang
[14279.53s -> 14282.11s]  we can
[14282.11s -> 14284.11s]  Prepare to fight the slime god
[14284.19s -> 14286.70s]  It's kind of hard
[14286.70s -> 14290.70s]  Or we can prepare to fight the wall of flesh which will change the whole world into heart
[14291.50s -> 14293.50s]  Which will open up a lot of new things
[14295.72s -> 14301.04s]  or
[14301.04s -> 14303.04s]  Can hold down this button from massive aoe
[14303.84s -> 14310.03s]  Or we can go look for the meteorite. That's how we can get you meteor armor
[14311.80s -> 14314.12s]  And then there's also a boss we can summon with meteorite
[14314.76s -> 14319.96s]  All right. What's the what's the the the progression from here, you know, what's the oh, no
[14319.96s -> 14322.60s]  Don't just like make a well and go to the bottom of hell
[14323.32s -> 14326.64s]  What would you say is? Okay. Here's like the next step
[14327.84s -> 14333.04s]  All of those were very good next steps doing the only thing is the little wall of flesh will
[14334.00s -> 14337.84s]  Turn it into hard mode. It doesn't stop you from doing the bosses, but it's kind of
[14339.44s -> 14344.00s]  If you want to do everything before you change it to hard mode, that would be the last thing you do. Okay
[14344.72s -> 14349.76s]  Well, I would say because you want to be caster guy we need to find where the meteorite landed
[14349.76s -> 14354.24s]  But I have no idea. I think we just have to walk right and I know how much you hate walking, right?
[14358.75s -> 14363.55s]  Eventually you can actually like create minecart tracks and stuff about you torches. I only have 31 torches
[14364.43s -> 14366.35s]  I have seven
[14366.35s -> 14368.35s]  Probably probably should make some
[14370.16s -> 14371.12s]  uh
[14371.12s -> 14373.12s]  Do we have materials in here for this?
[14373.36s -> 14377.39s]  The torch is in here. What is what is it wood?
[14378.19s -> 14380.19s]  uh gel and platforms
[14380.35s -> 14384.76s]  I don't think we have any gel do we
[14384.92s -> 14387.13s]  I'm just gonna make a shit look
[14387.13s -> 14389.63s]  We do. All right. I'm just gonna make a bunch
[14390.97s -> 14397.20s]  Oh my god, i'm gonna buy germa a gift a gift. He's gonna love me
[14398.72s -> 14400.72s]  You know how it's like your birthday right now
[14401.04s -> 14403.84s]  uh
[14404.72s -> 14408.80s]  Am I stupid or something what's going on here wood platform, sir
[14410.27s -> 14413.71s]  Term i'm trying to i'm right next to you. Happy birthday
[14416.68s -> 14419.13s]  Equip that and then press the r
[14423.08s -> 14432.01s]  How long can I stay like this forever forever? What?
[14435.98s -> 14438.54s]  Yes
[14440.54s -> 14443.95s]  Okay, thank you for giving me my first sona
[14445.60s -> 14446.96s]  No problem
[14446.96s -> 14448.96s]  You can see your first sona. Yes it is
[14449.60s -> 14454.40s]  All right, wooden flat not wood wood. Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. I see what you mean
[14455.12s -> 14473.23s]  All right, pause that and then we can go
[14473.79s -> 14482.22s]  I'm ready
[14482.22s -> 14487.21s]  Where'd you go? I'm coming. You went I went to space. Why'd you go space?
[14488.73s -> 14492.22s]  I was waiting. Oh, I need my mirror too
[14501.58s -> 14503.58s]  Sometimes you just go to space
[14503.96s -> 14505.23s]  All right
[14505.23s -> 14506.03s]  so
[14506.03s -> 14508.70s]  What's happening?
[14508.70s -> 14511.98s]  Are we ready for this?
[14511.98s -> 14517.58s]  Uh, what do I say we were doing? We were going really far. You said you go really far right to find the meteor
[14518.22s -> 14524.43s]  Okay, while we're there
[14524.83s -> 14526.83s]  Actually, no, we can't do it on the right
[14527.31s -> 14530.27s]  We'll figure it out. You know, it's a journey together. Yes it is
[14543.42s -> 14546.94s]  Can you eventually get in a fast travel or car or something to go here fast
[14547.18s -> 14553.36s]  I was gonna say you can set up minecart tracks. There's also like redstone like there's in minecraft. You can set up a teleporter
[14554.32s -> 14560.64s]  Uh, there's also boots that make you sprint but we have not found any of them and the cobbler has not arrived because he's an asshole
[14563.33s -> 14565.33s]  It's gonna be nighttime. Is it a bad thing or a good thing?
[14566.05s -> 14568.05s]  It doesn't matter doesn't matter
[14568.77s -> 14571.25s]  also, eventually you get yeah, there's mounts and they're
[14572.13s -> 14574.61s]  Um wings that are pretty fast
[14579.12s -> 14585.09s]  Cool
[14585.09s -> 14587.65s]  So I know when you make when you make a new minecraft seed
[14588.45s -> 14591.49s]  It's oh 30 times the size of earth
[14592.45s -> 14594.45s]  How many times the size of earth?
[14594.85s -> 14598.05s]  is terraria
[14598.05s -> 14600.29s]  Uh, i'm gonna i'm gonna say 600 times
[14606.82s -> 14608.90s]  I'm gonna say actually we should abandon earth
[14609.78s -> 14611.78s]  And just live in terraria
[14611.94s -> 14613.94s]  Upload our brains in here
[14617.20s -> 14619.52s]  He uh, somebody's calling us a dean dingus
[14621.04s -> 14623.84s]  They're saying build more rooms you dean dinguses
[14624.80s -> 14627.76s]  Yeah, now they're right. But building rooms is the most boring part
[14629.62s -> 14633.62s]  Here's the trick here. I want to show you I can't do moves. How do I get out of this?
[14634.18s -> 14637.23s]  Oh, okay trick
[14637.23s -> 14638.03s]  um
[14638.03s -> 14640.03s]  So this this room pre-exists
[14641.47s -> 14643.47s]  Okay, where is there? Uh
[14644.27s -> 14645.55s]  I need a chair
[14645.55s -> 14651.23s]  What you do is you take someone stupid like the painter that you never want to talk and then you force him to live way out here
[14651.71s -> 14653.39s]  Why?
[14653.39s -> 14656.78s]  So that the rooms in your base free up
[14659.55s -> 14661.55s]  But I don't have a chair to place in here
[14662.35s -> 14664.35s]  Painter all the way over here
[14666.61s -> 14668.61s]  But does why would he have an axe?
[14668.61s -> 14669.90s]  I do
[14669.90s -> 14671.98s]  Can you chop down these trees?
[14672.86s -> 14674.14s]  Yeah
[14674.14s -> 14677.62s]  Like I can handle it
[14677.62s -> 14681.39s]  What do you need these chopped down for you need the wood?
[14681.95s -> 14685.15s]  Yeah, so I can I can make a chair and force the painter to live in exile
[14685.95s -> 14687.95s]  Normally, I build them like on the planets
[14691.73s -> 14693.25s]  pet snow owl
[14693.25s -> 14698.06s]  I don't want it
[14698.06s -> 14701.98s]  Painter is a god npc. You're really making a lot of people very sad right now
[14710.35s -> 14723.26s]  Summoner weapon proficiency level up. So what what are you doing?
[14727.39s -> 14729.39s]  Apparently it didn't have a table
[14735.39s -> 14745.65s]  These things are pretty good
[14745.65s -> 14748.05s]  So equipable, what do I equip it though?
[14749.17s -> 14750.54s]  Oh
[14750.54s -> 14752.70s]  Uh, it's in the corruption. It doesn't count as a house
[14755.09s -> 14759.17s]  Never mind is that is it just right there. What does he do just stare at me?
[14761.34s -> 14763.98s]  Oh, yeah, that's just the pet most pets don't do anything
[14767.36s -> 14771.04s]  I have the I have a bee following me. Oh, I was wondering what the bee was
[14775.62s -> 14779.86s]  There's some good pets that like provide light and stuff, but most of them do not
[14780.90s -> 14785.66s]  So we're just walking to the right until we find
[14787.39s -> 14788.03s]  the
[14788.03s -> 14789.47s]  meteor
[14789.47s -> 14790.35s]  Yeah
[14790.35s -> 14793.63s]  But there's no other goal. We just walk right until we see it
[14794.51s -> 14800.45s]  Yep, because on our map we explored left and I didn't see a meteorite on the map. The map always updates automatically
[14801.33s -> 14802.29s]  Oh
[14802.29s -> 14804.29s]  So it should be this way
[14807.12s -> 14810.32s]  Then there's gonna be some sick sick ass meteor heads
[14813.64s -> 14816.84s]  So when we get to the meteor, does the boss just spawn after we touch it or something?
[14817.91s -> 14820.31s]  No, the meteor is uh, you just it's
[14821.11s -> 14823.35s]  A resource just so you get meteorites from it
[14824.15s -> 14826.15s]  What is this?
[14828.69s -> 14833.49s]  Uh kill that kill it kill it kill it i am i am i'm killing it so we need the blighted gel from it
[14840.58s -> 14842.58s]  Oh god, oh god, dude
[14843.46s -> 14846.26s]  I dropped 22 gold in that hole. I'll get it
[14849.96s -> 14853.03s]  We still haven't made hooks
[14853.03s -> 14857.14s]  How far down is that hole?
[14857.14s -> 14858.98s]  So i'm gonna rope down there
[14858.98s -> 14867.75s]  It's not that far. Should I just jump?
[14869.51s -> 14871.51s]  You can see where you're dude
[14871.91s -> 14873.35s]  I believe in you
[14873.35s -> 14888.40s]  Do I have any rope?
[14888.40s -> 14891.36s]  Are you even in the right hole? No, you're not other hole. What do you mean other hole?
[14892.16s -> 14895.80s]  There's another hole right guy. I don't know if it shows for you. Oh, no
[14896.44s -> 14897.72s]  Okay
[14902.96s -> 14904.16s]  So are you
[14904.16s -> 14906.24s]  Stay trying to stay down here or what are you doing? What are you up to?
[14906.40s -> 14908.96s]  I'm coming back up. I'm just making sure I get the gel from that thing
[14909.60s -> 14922.96s]  That's over here
[14922.96s -> 14931.38s]  rotten chunk
[14931.38s -> 14933.70s]  I'm afraid to just walk forward now because of that
[14940.68s -> 14942.28s]  I've got the grab arm
[14942.28s -> 14944.64s]  I'm just gonna hold my torch out
[14949.35s -> 14951.75s]  That's bright. Oh, we still have to do this actually
[14953.51s -> 14956.39s]  I forgot about this guy
[14956.39s -> 14961.96s]  Huh? Hurry we need to build platforms
[14964.44s -> 14966.12s]  Hurry
[14966.12s -> 14968.12s]  We're gonna fight somebody
[14968.44s -> 14972.08s]  And he's a pain in the ass
[14972.79s -> 14974.71s]  Fight pain in the ass guy
[14974.71s -> 14978.87s]  Yeah, you have to uh, you talk to the old man in front of this which is the dungeon
[14979.83s -> 14985.27s]  You can only enter the dungeon after you free him of his curse and his curse is that a giant forearm skeleton lives inside of
[14985.27s -> 14987.27s]  His body and you gotta fight it
[14987.67s -> 14989.67s]  It's a pretty wicked curse
[14989.75s -> 14991.75s]  That is a pretty big curse
[14992.55s -> 15001.32s]  Yeah
[15001.32s -> 15003.32s]  This is a big platform you're making
[15008.44s -> 15014.79s]  He's a piece of shit
[15014.79s -> 15016.79s]  In fact, I worry about us
[15016.79s -> 15018.45s]  Do you?
[15018.45s -> 15022.53s]  Yeah, I do. You ready? I guess eat your food free food
[15023.81s -> 15027.49s]  Okay
[15027.49s -> 15029.49s]  I've free fooded
[15029.49s -> 15036.53s]  Oh, he doesn't have four arms. Is that only the
[15037.39s -> 15041.24s]  Mechanical guy
[15041.24s -> 15043.24s]  I guess we all have a curse
[15045.64s -> 15049.28s]  Oh, he's a chump freaking normal mode
[15053.32s -> 15060.82s]  Oh bees
[15060.82s -> 15062.82s]  There's a certain place we should be aiming
[15062.98s -> 15068.96s]  into his head
[15068.96s -> 15069.92s]  chump
[15069.92s -> 15075.28s]  I thought you said he was really hard
[15075.28s -> 15077.36s]  He can be but I don't usually play on baby mode
[15081.60s -> 15084.48s]  Let's turn the drop. Sorry drop anything. Sorry. I'm the anchor
[15086.28s -> 15088.84s]  No, it's fine. Like really normal mode eventually when we get into the
[15089.72s -> 15092.47s]  Still hard. Okay
[15092.47s -> 15095.60s]  So now we can go in the dungeon
[15096.39s -> 15100.39s]  Uh, yeah, I want to keep looking for the meteor though. Oh right, right, right, right, right, right
[15102.37s -> 15105.25s]  Though the dungeon has a couple of things we could really use
[15112.98s -> 15115.14s]  We are very far away from our home
[15116.85s -> 15118.85s]  Here I got two
[15120.87s -> 15122.31s]  Manicristo
[15122.31s -> 15123.91s]  Yeah, I gave you two
[15123.91s -> 15126.44s]  zombie banner
[15126.44s -> 15131.16s]  Uh, it auto gives that to you when like 50 of something dies and if you hang out at home
[15131.40s -> 15134.12s]  You deal like two times damage for that enemy
[15135.48s -> 15141.20s]  Cool
[15141.20s -> 15144.10s]  It's a neat little game
[15144.10s -> 15146.10s]  So there's no meteor
[15149.59s -> 15151.59s]  And your follow-up to that?
[15152.69s -> 15153.97s]  No
[15153.97s -> 15157.56s]  Uh, I guess I was wrong. Let's go in the dungeon
[15161.17s -> 15163.17s]  Into the dungeon it is
[15166.66s -> 15175.36s]  Ow what these crocodile things geez who the fuck is who's tyler?
[15176.40s -> 15178.40s]  Oh, he's the fishing
[15178.88s -> 15180.16s]  No
[15180.16s -> 15182.16s]  Don't die don't die, dude
[15183.51s -> 15185.19s]  You're gonna die
[15185.19s -> 15187.43s]  You're gonna die. No, i'm trying to avoid being hit
[15188.61s -> 15190.61s]  No, that's oh, that's my stupid
[15190.77s -> 15193.01s]  I thought the owl was coming to get me
[15193.41s -> 15203.43s]  Thank you, dude. I was on a healing streak
[15204.23s -> 15207.62s]  These kids don't even know about me
[15216.56s -> 15218.56s]  I'm out of ammo
[15221.14s -> 15224.10s]  Uh, somebody said the meteor is probably on the sky that's pretty likely
[15225.14s -> 15227.14s]  God sky meteor, I guess
[15228.10s -> 15230.10s]  In this particular seed
[15230.18s -> 15232.18s]  I don't think i've ever seen that
[15237.14s -> 15240.40s]  Thank god i'm so stupid
[15245.54s -> 15247.94s]  Uh rope oh because I have
[15249.86s -> 15251.30s]  A lot of jump
[15251.30s -> 15254.05s]  You could probably turn into a frog and do it
[15254.37s -> 15256.05s]  Would that be better?
[15256.05s -> 15258.05s]  Oh is that do I jump higher?
[15258.61s -> 15261.65s]  The first jump you do is higher. Yeah. Well, I you didn't tell me that
[15262.69s -> 15264.87s]  I thought it was just a cosmetic thing
[15268.95s -> 15275.35s]  Nice automatically update. Isn't that a lie though? Because you can see plantera's bulbs when they become available
[15275.83s -> 15277.83s]  If you've already been in that spot
[15278.31s -> 15284.82s]  It's very dark up here
[15286.84s -> 15288.68s]  Where are you going?
[15288.68s -> 15291.38s]  I'm going to the dungeon
[15291.38s -> 15292.34s]  Oh
[15292.34s -> 15296.44s]  I was just hoping there would be something up there
[15303.14s -> 15304.66s]  Okay
[15304.66s -> 15306.90s]  Into the dungeons. This is this is the dungeon
[15307.94s -> 15311.30s]  This is the oh, yeah. Okay. So what you need to find and make sure you
[15311.94s -> 15313.94s]  see him is uh
[15315.80s -> 15320.92s]  Uh golden keys gold because there's gonna be a bunch of golden chests down here that you need keys to open
[15321.24s -> 15323.24s]  That drop from the enemies
[15323.32s -> 15328.52s]  Okay, so look for golden keys and inside a golden chest the number one thing
[15329.40s -> 15331.40s]  We're looking out for yeah
[15332.20s -> 15334.20s]  Is a uh shadow key
[15335.16s -> 15339.48s]  Shadow key so we need we need a key to get a new key is what that's that's the goal
[15340.12s -> 15344.12s]  That's like best case. Otherwise, there's just like decent stuff in these chests understood
[15348.48s -> 15350.88s]  So how far down does this go?
[15350.88s -> 15352.48s]  Uh, it's pretty big
[15352.48s -> 15362.47s]  It's uh pretty
[15363.41s -> 15365.41s]  Pretty pretty big
[15367.27s -> 15372.09s]  Oh, and we got the uh, the the mechanic who is my terraria waifu
[15373.54s -> 15376.55s]  Just in case you're wondering
[15376.55s -> 15378.55s]  We got wire cutter
[15380.69s -> 15386.13s]  She's the person that lets you set up like the wires to set up teleporters and stuff. Oh, what's this do?
[15388.84s -> 15391.16s]  There's like a switch here. I can't press it
[15395.99s -> 15397.99s]  Waiting for you
[15398.23s -> 15400.23s]  What's the switch do?
[15401.01s -> 15403.97s]  Uh turns on the lights. Oh, so why didn't I turn it?
[15407.48s -> 15410.76s]  It turns on like one small lantern you probably just didn't notice
[15416.26s -> 15417.14s]  chest
[15417.14s -> 15422.79s]  This is the key needs to have one of those golden keys. Yep
[15428.16s -> 15430.96s]  the ultra stream sting i'm a streamer
[15437.38s -> 15439.46s]  There are spikes on the walls and floors that hurt
[15440.82s -> 15445.22s]  That are they are hurt. There's also traps down here. So like dark traps that'll shoot things out
[15445.78s -> 15447.78s]  You step on the pressure plates great
[15450.04s -> 15452.04s]  Really looking forward to that
[15452.76s -> 15454.76s]  And those things that go along the ground
[15457.03s -> 15461.81s]  The heck is that you just like summon a bunch of spots
[15465.60s -> 15467.60s]  So there's the key that we don't have
[15468.48s -> 15470.64s]  What what just hit me?
[15470.64s -> 15472.24s]  uh dart trap
[15472.24s -> 15479.48s]  They're hard to see
[15479.48s -> 15481.60s]  rained on
[15481.60s -> 15484.40s]  Do aggro them up here and they'll get hit by my rain clouds
[15485.67s -> 15494.31s]  all comboed
[15494.39s -> 15498.63s]  And the thing he's standing on are spikes. You don't stand on spikes spikes are bad wand core
[15501.78s -> 15505.06s]  Uh, they craft some really shitty wands that are really complicated to make
[15507.06s -> 15509.06s]  There's like one decent one
[15510.61s -> 15512.61s]  If I remember correctly
[15526.05s -> 15532.20s]  Um, what do I do? Uh, you see i'm attached to the ceiling with a I thought
[15532.76s -> 15535.48s]  The fucking painting was like a platform
[15536.36s -> 15538.36s]  This game is so dark
[15541.24s -> 15548.23s]  Oh
[15548.23s -> 15559.12s]  All right. We're uh, how did you make that hook that you're attached to the ceiling with?
[15560.15s -> 15561.76s]  um
[15561.76s -> 15564.00s]  You can check the box
[15564.00s -> 15568.96s]  You need 15 of a gem so if we have like 15 amethyst or something
[15570.08s -> 15572.16s]  I don't think we have
[15572.16s -> 15576.45s]  enough
[15576.45s -> 15583.64s]  No, well, we're coming back. Uh, I think I didn't have that much money. I don't think but there was some gold down there
[15583.64s -> 15585.16s]  I would go get it
[15585.16s -> 15591.60s]  Put the stuff away
[15591.60s -> 15593.68s]  Our we're we're full
[15595.40s -> 15597.40s]  We're full our box is full
[15600.04s -> 15602.04s]  We can take some shit out
[15610.21s -> 15621.49s]  Cane dust
[15621.49s -> 15624.44s]  Making night owl potion
[15624.44s -> 15627.01s]  Really? Is that gonna help me?
[15627.01s -> 15629.01s]  Not really. Oh, yeah, maybe
[15629.25s -> 15631.97s]  We need there's a potion vendor too and he would sell them for cheap
[15632.93s -> 15636.80s]  Then where was it?
[15636.80s -> 15638.80s]  He is not enjoying this yet
[15639.41s -> 15642.53s]  Can I craft that or did I have here it is increases night vision?
[15644.10s -> 15647.54s]  Uh, give me that please because also I think it's called a shine potion
[15650.37s -> 15653.17s]  What the fuck is going on right now in the house
[15655.52s -> 15657.60s]  What if I die in the house i'm gonna

[15841.68s -> 15844.96s]  Sends out a droplet of water that will create small tidal waves
[15846.48s -> 15848.48s]  Ooh, that's cool

[15889.09s -> 15892.53s]  Oh, all right. Yeah. All right. This is awesome. I thought it was
[15893.09s -> 15895.01s]  Okay

[16006.55s -> 16010.07s]  And then after the first blood moon, there's an npc that'll join you
[16011.43s -> 16016.53s]  How do I just take them?

[16067.78s -> 16081.19s]  See you there
[16081.19s -> 16083.67s]  Is there can we put like a checkpoint flag somewhere over here?
[16087.51s -> 16091.59s]  What is there? We can't put like a checkpoint flag. We have to always have to go all the way over here again
[16092.47s -> 16094.79s]  Mm-hmm unless you want to build a wine cart
[16095.67s -> 16097.67s]  That goes all the way there
[16097.67s -> 16102.13s]  You just make a bed there
[16102.13s -> 16104.13s]  Yeah, but then you won't have this bed
[16104.45s -> 16108.29s]  That's true
[16108.29s -> 16110.29s]  You make a sleeping bag
[16110.29s -> 16113.09s]  Or a tent
[16113.09s -> 16115.09s]  Sounds interesting
[16118.23s -> 16120.23s]  I don't even know what the hell that was but
[16122.48s -> 16128.36s]  Got hurt from it
[16128.36s -> 16131.24s]  I gotta build houses man. Like I don't wanna
[16132.36s -> 16135.92s]  But I gotta

[16149.52s -> 16151.52s]  Oh, that's your spot on
[16152.00s -> 16155.14s]  I mean, it's raining
[16155.14s -> 16169.08s]  This fishing in this game. Yeah, didn't you say that you didn't you didn't really dabble into fishing at all?
[16169.64s -> 16171.64s]  I have never dabbled
[16171.96s -> 16173.41s]  you have
[16173.41s -> 16176.05s]  How many what do you have like six seven eight hundred hours in this game?
[16177.49s -> 16183.44s]  Uh about 200
[16183.76s -> 16186.00s]  Really even after all the other times you played this
[16188.32s -> 16190.32s]  I mean I had I okay I had
[16190.46s -> 16192.90s]  Uh 160
[16195.65s -> 16200.29s]  And I didn't play it that much when it was new. I played like 60 hours and there wasn't that much to do
[16201.83s -> 16203.20s]  um
[16203.20s -> 16207.68s]  Way back when the game first came out that skeleton that we just beat was like the final boss
[16208.16s -> 16211.84s]  Are you serious? I think when terraria was first released there was nothing after that. Wow
[16213.92s -> 16215.92s]  That's so that's so
[16217.36s -> 16218.88s]  Early
[16218.88s -> 16220.88s]  Yeah, and now he's like
[16222.48s -> 16224.48s]  Yeah, there's there's a lot of shit

[16230.50s -> 16232.26s]  Oh cool
[16232.26s -> 16241.22s]  I'm freaking out. I didn't have enough
[16241.62s -> 16249.24s]  Do I have three? No, one more big snowball head
[16256.21s -> 16260.93s]  I don't think i'm gonna be changing weapons for a very long time. This thing is unbelievable
[16262.66s -> 16264.34s]  Does a bunch of damage
[16264.34s -> 16266.90s]  It's got a nice spread on it
[16266.90s -> 16268.90s]  Nice spread doesn't use that much mana
[16271.96s -> 16273.96s]  For the first time in my life
[16274.04s -> 16277.08s]  I feel like i'm truly true. No, I can't do that
[16284.77s -> 16287.40s]  Yeah, and it lights my way
[16287.40s -> 16289.72s]  I don't even need torches anymore. I can just go like this
[16293.89s -> 16295.49s]  I need torches
[16295.49s -> 16297.49s]  Uh, I have 76
[16298.98s -> 16302.42s]  You should definitely make some though. So I because i'm a very unreliable person
[16303.46s -> 16305.46s]  Don't like rely on me for that
[16308.48s -> 16312.00s]  Because you know what's gonna happen torches you're gonna be very disappointed. I
[16315.01s -> 16325.06s]  I need torches
[16325.46s -> 16327.46s]  Am I there where is this place
[16332.34s -> 16334.52s]  Where the hell is this place?
[16334.52s -> 16338.44s]  I'm not even there yet. Yeah, you're not there yet
[16340.71s -> 16342.47s]  I thought you were the guy
[16342.47s -> 16344.47s]  No, i'm not. I have a mini map open
[16354.64s -> 16357.28s]  Okay, I have 1800 torches i'm ready to go
[16358.72s -> 16360.96s]  All right. Well, i'm like almost there
[16360.96s -> 16363.04s]  I'm at where we bought the skeleton guy
[16364.00s -> 16369.46s]  What flavor jawbreaker do you want when I go to the jawbreaker store?
[16371.62s -> 16373.86s]  um
[16373.86s -> 16376.74s]  Uh plain chocolate. No, just plain
[16384.02s -> 16387.54s]  All right. I've made it you can teleport to me whenever you want whenever you feel like it
[16395.33s -> 16403.43s]  Concrete plain the one that is just the white one that has all the other ones inside of it
[16404.23s -> 16406.85s]  Did you know that fish isn't good for you?
[16407.25s -> 16410.05s]  Um
[16412.90s -> 16416.82s]  I don't I don't sure what I I can't even give that a response. It's actually true
[16417.86s -> 16419.62s]  the new reports
[16419.62s -> 16424.08s]  Yeah, I think it's like doctor sign sign wiser
[16424.80s -> 16428.24s]  I'm saying that like you're a dummy a fisher from the ocean and you're not
[16428.80s -> 16430.96s]  Stop eating them
[16430.96s -> 16432.32s]  All right. Well
[16432.32s -> 16436.21s]  I forgot to buy musket balls your mercury
[16437.01s -> 16439.17s]  Not every fish is full of mercury
[16440.13s -> 16447.49s]  And all that mercury and like cod
[16449.62s -> 16451.38s]  That's no joke
[16451.38s -> 16453.38s]  All that it's not
[16455.60s -> 16457.12s]  Yeah, and guess what?
[16457.12s -> 16458.72s]  when you cook
[16458.72s -> 16460.32s]  meat on a grill
[16460.32s -> 16463.22s]  It releases a shitload of carcinogenics
[16464.74s -> 16469.38s]  All that stuff that you like to eat. I like those crispy edges and the little charcoal crispy
[16469.38s -> 16472.82s]  It that's it's awful awful for you, but we do it. Oh, everybody does it
[16473.62s -> 16475.46s]  I don't do it
[16475.46s -> 16480.26s]  You've never had a grilled piece of meat. What am I fucking bumping my head on i'm getting too angry at this game
[16480.34s -> 16490.77s]  I gotta slow down
[16490.93s -> 16493.57s]  Who's who actually has grilled pieces of meat?
[16495.22s -> 16499.25s]  What like your grandfather maybe?
[16500.29s -> 16507.12s]  What is it coming over here? What is that thing? What's this plan destroy that as a trap? Oh, all right, this is kind of
[16507.92s -> 16510.48s]  So is there a boss at the bottom of this?
[16510.72s -> 16515.51s]  No
[16515.51s -> 16518.79s]  Uh later there is a boss here much much much much later
[16519.75s -> 16522.18s]  For now, it's just kind of a pet
[16522.74s -> 16524.74s]  And bones
[16528.26s -> 16540.74s]  All the money down there, but too, uh scared to go over there. Oh my god, what are you doing dying?
[16542.80s -> 16543.84s]  you

[16549.92s -> 16551.92s]  Actually water is bad for you
[16558.68s -> 16561.65s]  It's true
[16561.65s -> 16567.14s]  dungeon heist
[16567.14s -> 16571.54s]  Blue candles spawning more enemies kill the blue candles. Don't kill the blue candles
[16572.42s -> 16575.04s]  But somebody on the internet told me to do that
[16575.76s -> 16580.08s]  But that somebody doesn't know that we really would like more of me so that they have a higher chance of
[16581.12s -> 16584.45s]  That's where I died before
[16584.45s -> 16586.45s]  I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
[16592.82s -> 16594.82s]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah
[16595.30s -> 16603.17s]  All right, so is it not safe to go down there?

[16628.44s -> 16630.36s]  I didn't know what it was
[16630.36s -> 16633.62s]  You're not calling my wife a slot machine
[16634.26s -> 16640.58s]  No, that is not what I said slot machine as in like a question. Is that a slot machine next to you?
[16643.68s -> 16645.68s]  I don't I didn't see it

[16666.07s -> 16669.19s]  Are you do you want to bring these pianos back? You want to make a dungeon room?
[16671.73s -> 16673.46s]  No
[16673.46s -> 16678.18s]  You don't just want to chill out and make like candy rooms and dungeon rooms. No, the candy room would be fun, but
[16679.94s -> 16681.78s]  Everything else is
[16681.78s -> 16683.78s]  Well, that was horrible that hurt
[16689.09s -> 16691.09s]  Hey, holy shit, man
[16693.83s -> 16709.06s]  Sitting up here. Um, how are we doing down there? All right, i'm gonna open this one
[16709.70s -> 16712.07s]  I already opened it. He did
[16716.50s -> 16718.50s]  Mystic magic missile
[16719.46s -> 16721.46s]  Mystic magic missile
[16722.18s -> 16727.38s]  Would you just drop it?
[16727.38s -> 16730.18s]  Yep
[16730.18s -> 16733.14s]  Wait, you're gonna get to use some magic myth
[16734.26s -> 16737.62s]  Did I pick it up?
[16737.62s -> 16742.16s]  Yeah
[16742.16s -> 16747.09s]  Well, i'll look at it later. Look at it now
[16747.65s -> 16753.17s]  Look at it now. I can't we're being fired at from all directions. I'm not just gonna stop and let me look at my items
[16753.73s -> 16755.73s]  It's a new item
[16755.89s -> 16759.11s]  What does it do?
[16759.11s -> 16764.07s]  That's okay. That's a lot of guys. Can we get some uh, I don't have this mystic magic missile
[16765.49s -> 16770.61s]  There's a rod. Oh 31 damage. All right, i'll give it a try. You're gonna see give it a try
[16776.26s -> 16786.85s]  Do you want to know why a magic missile is so good? What does it do? No
[16788.76s -> 16790.39s]  I guess it's
[16790.39s -> 16792.55s]  magic missile
[16792.55s -> 16794.79s]  Very fast very strong nine mana
[16795.73s -> 16800.21s]  It's just like a fast good item just goes like bang bang bang bang bang
[16801.25s -> 16804.45s]  It's like a little solo target. I like it. I don't love it though
[16805.25s -> 16808.07s]  Yeah, I think if you hold you can
[16811.73s -> 16815.81s]  But also your other thing does feel a lot better yeah, the other one's more mana efficient
[16816.93s -> 16822.24s]  Is that what you guys think a meteorite?
[16827.75s -> 16832.69s]  Hold the button
[16832.69s -> 16834.37s]  Oh you can
[16834.37s -> 16836.84s]  Hold on. Can I just like
[16836.84s -> 16839.16s]  Have that sit on somebody?
[16840.79s -> 16842.79s]  Can I sit that on somebody?
[16843.03s -> 16846.82s]  and it
[16846.82s -> 16849.54s]  No, okay. I didn't know if I could just hold it continuously on them
[16857.20s -> 16860.82s]  You got any keys now we need to stay I do we need to stick together
[16864.07s -> 16867.83s]  I'm looking for chests. You're just fighting the same old thing looking at your dumb item
[16868.55s -> 16872.71s]  How come I don't get items? You should check on how that item works. Jeremy
[16873.43s -> 16877.35s]  So you said and I said, okay i'll give it a try I was joking
[16886.37s -> 16891.41s]  How much further are we gonna go deep dungeon, isn't it?
[16892.29s -> 16898.69s]  Is there a golden chest thing?
[16900.15s -> 16901.59s]  right here
[16901.59s -> 16903.75s]  This isn't a locked one though
[16903.75s -> 16904.71s]  unlocked
[16904.71s -> 16907.46s]  It had a gold cannon
[16907.46s -> 16910.16s]  cool
[16910.16s -> 16912.08s]  The skulls they explode. They look like they explode
[16912.88s -> 16914.00s]  Nope
[16914.00s -> 16917.88s]  I'll kill this guy
[16917.88s -> 16922.28s]  Can I have that sword you don't use?
[16922.28s -> 16924.45s]  Uh, it's in the box
[16924.45s -> 16926.05s]  Uh you fucker
[16926.05s -> 16928.21s]  Why would I just carry that around with me if i'm not gonna use it?
[16929.01s -> 16932.45s]  I thought you were using it. I mean I I have too many items
[16934.00s -> 16936.96s]  I have too many cool things to use. I can't carry it around
[16938.93s -> 16941.33s]  You're the melee guy. You're the one that should have had it
[16942.13s -> 16945.17s]  Why did I why am I holding? I didn't want to be a melee guy
[16946.21s -> 16948.21s]  Well, what are you?
[16949.01s -> 16951.01s]  Oh, you didn't want to be melee guy
[16955.73s -> 16958.45s]  I want to play my tuba. How do I get what's going on?
[16959.17s -> 16962.69s]  Why am I stuck in this chest?
[16962.69s -> 16966.79s]  Uh
[16966.79s -> 16969.88s]  Oh happened to me too
[16969.88s -> 16971.12s]  What?
[16971.12s -> 16973.12s]  Yeah, that's uh, that's a bad program
[16975.00s -> 16975.96s]  Do I
[16975.96s -> 16978.66s]  Can I like put something in it?
[16978.66s -> 16981.62s]  I can't teleport. Yeah, it's just broken
[16982.34s -> 16983.70s]  I think we're fucked
[16983.70s -> 16986.82s]  No game over. Did you open it? Why'd you open it too?
[16987.54s -> 16989.54s]  Because I wanted to see what you
[16990.66s -> 16992.18s]  Open it
[16992.18s -> 16996.34s]  I just wanted to see if there was really a problem. I said i'm stuck. What's wrong?
[16996.42s -> 16998.69s]  And then uh
[16998.69s -> 17000.93s]  Are we sure there's nothing that can happen here?
[17003.01s -> 17005.01s]  Uh, you can leave and rejoin
[17005.57s -> 17007.57s]  Well, what would that was it gonna put me?
[17008.13s -> 17010.13s]  Uh back at your bed

[17012.53s -> 17013.49s]  Yeah
[17013.49s -> 17017.97s]  Wait, okay. What if you stay here then the server will go down. Okay. What if you stay I come back and then teleport to you
[17019.06s -> 17021.06s]  Do you have a wormhole potion?
[17021.89s -> 17029.83s]  Uh, I I have them but I can't give them to you because we're both lost
[17031.33s -> 17034.37s]  I'm gonna have to leave too. No, can I I think I can I make
[17035.33s -> 17038.45s]  I think there might be a wormhole potion in the chest. All right. Hold on
[17039.25s -> 17044.53s]  I'll be back. I mean i'm i'm going to have to leave as well because i'm just talking but you own the place
[17045.33s -> 17047.33s]  I own the place
[17048.44s -> 17049.56s]  Fuck
[17049.56s -> 17051.00s]  No
[17051.00s -> 17053.72s]  I got it. Yeah, I saved an exit and got a bigger. Uh
[17055.43s -> 17061.11s]  Oh well, we have been live. Oh, i've been live for seven hours almost eight actually
[17061.99s -> 17063.91s]  So are we gonna keep going?
[17063.91s -> 17064.87s]  um
[17064.87s -> 17068.40s]  you uh do
[17069.49s -> 17071.65s]  You want to just let's get to the bottom of that dungeon
[17074.58s -> 17076.58s]  Okay, will that be like significant?
[17077.48s -> 17079.57s]  More time
[17079.57s -> 17082.71s]  No, not really. All right. Let's do that. It's don't open any chests
[17085.52s -> 17088.16s]  Any chest that isn't a golden chest you can't open anyway, so don't
[17088.80s -> 17090.52s]  Don't touch them
[17090.52s -> 17101.06s]  Okay. All right. So are you going back in?
[17103.65s -> 17111.91s]  Yeah, one second
[17113.12s -> 17119.09s]  You let me know you let me know when you're in there
[17120.88s -> 17122.08s]  I'm in there
[17122.08s -> 17123.04s]  Okay
[17123.04s -> 17130.02s]  I want to join off of you use that character
[17138.07s -> 17140.31s]  Joining in game. Here we go
[17141.27s -> 17144.95s]  Yeah, there are some people here that like do not deserve to live in this house
[17147.11s -> 17149.11s]  Who are all these people?
[17149.59s -> 17152.32s]  Wait, hold on
[17152.32s -> 17154.32s]  Who the fuck are all these people?
[17154.56s -> 17157.89s]  Why did this become a hotel?
[17158.90s -> 17161.30s]  I like this is not even all of them
[17168.04s -> 17170.04s]  Hey paul
[17170.04s -> 17174.36s]  Is why you talk shit about the painter like like if you really need some painting done
[17174.92s -> 17178.20s]  You can go seek him out. All right. So listen what so what happens?
[17179.08s -> 17184.37s]  So these are just npcs that they just wander around if you don't lock them in a cage in your house
[17185.17s -> 17188.77s]  Where do they go? Just they all just scatter around where their home is
[17190.13s -> 17194.05s]  So the strategy is to keep them into little cubicles like it's an office
[17195.17s -> 17196.21s]  Yeah
[17196.21s -> 17200.13s]  And there's different departments. Otherwise they wander around and if you want to talk to one
[17200.29s -> 17204.37s]  They could be like next to someone and you'll like can't talk to them because they're under the other guy
[17205.81s -> 17217.25s]  But okay, okay, let's just say for instance if I threw a bomb in this room right now, uh, please
[17219.17s -> 17221.17s]  I'm just theoretically
[17221.80s -> 17224.31s]  Is it is that bad?
[17224.31s -> 17225.27s]  Yes, okay
[17225.27s -> 17231.75s]  I didn't know if they can be hurt or friendly fire. They can be hurt and more importantly you destroy the room and I you know
[17231.75s -> 17233.11s]  Who's a rebel?
[17233.11s -> 17237.83s]  Yes, i'm aware who's going to rebuild it. All right, let's let's go. Are you already on your way there?
[17238.31s -> 17240.63s]  Hold on. I'm like in the sky and I found three
[17241.51s -> 17242.95s]  planets
[17242.95s -> 17245.57s]  three planets
[17245.57s -> 17247.09s]  I'm just gonna like
[17247.09s -> 17249.09s]  Make people live up here really fast
[17255.09s -> 17257.73s]  I didn't bring like a workbench or wood
[17258.69s -> 17260.69s]  Mining potion flip. Yeah, we don't have any um
[17261.57s -> 17263.57s]  Any wormhole potions anyways?
[17263.57s -> 17270.39s]  I gotta join your team
[17270.39s -> 17272.23s]  Uh, do you want that?
[17272.23s -> 17274.23s]  What sword the cool one?
[17274.63s -> 17275.99s]  Yeah
[17275.99s -> 17277.51s]  All right. I have that
[17277.51s -> 17279.88s]  Is there anything else that I should take out of here?
[17280.52s -> 17282.52s]  That we I mean actually want to have with us
[17284.42s -> 17286.84s]  No
[17286.84s -> 17288.84s]  Rope. Um
[17288.84s -> 17290.84s]  I think I deposited accidentally
[17293.91s -> 17295.91s]  uh, yeah, um
[17296.93s -> 17297.97s]  Rope
[17297.97s -> 17302.77s]  All right, the specimen is gonna live in the sky pyramid because fuck that guy spelunker
[17303.89s -> 17313.32s]  Night owl potion. Okay. All right. I think it's we got we got some daylight here. Let's go
[17314.04s -> 17324.40s]  Time start going time to go
[17325.44s -> 17329.96s]  That's enough for one day
[17329.96s -> 17332.61s]  We will come back another time
[17332.61s -> 17334.64s]  time to go
[17334.64s -> 17336.16s]  Are you following me?
[17336.16s -> 17345.81s]  I'll be there
[17345.81s -> 17347.84s]  All right. I'm going
[17347.84s -> 17349.84s]  Yeah, and i'm gonna make you a grappling hook
[17352.45s -> 17354.45s]  You're gonna make me a grappling hook
[17354.69s -> 17356.69s]  What a swell guy
[17357.03s -> 17361.19s]  What color would you like? How do I skip forward to when you guys are in the dungeon?
[17362.16s -> 17367.28s]  Uh, it's it's there's only one way. I'm really sorry. There's only one way that's possible
[17368.00s -> 17369.44s]  You have to
[17369.44s -> 17371.44s]  exit the stream
[17372.16s -> 17374.74s]  Take a bath
[17374.74s -> 17378.98s]  And take a nice long bath and by the time you get back the stream might not be live
[17380.23s -> 17381.59s]  So then you can
[17381.59s -> 17385.27s]  Load this back up get to this point exactly and then skip like 30 40 minutes ahead
[17387.99s -> 17389.99s]  That's really i'm that's the only way
[17390.47s -> 17392.71s]  If there was any other way, I maybe I can help you out here
[17393.51s -> 17397.86s]  It's not i'm sorry. I wish there was
[17406.37s -> 17408.85s]  Four days and I this is the fourth stream in a row four days in a row
[17408.85s -> 17411.01s]  I haven't done four days in a row in like at least a couple months
[17411.81s -> 17416.00s]  I don't usually do four days in a row. Congratulations. Hey, thank you
[17417.59s -> 17419.33s]  Wow
[17419.33s -> 17420.93s]  That's something
[17420.93s -> 17425.54s]  Throw bombs at the house before the stream's over. No, i'm not gonna like ruin his game
[17427.46s -> 17430.00s]  This is your game
[17430.00s -> 17434.64s]  You're the host as in this your like file dude. I have so many worlds that I wouldn't care

[17441.60s -> 17445.28s]  I don't want to just ruin the entire game. Yeah, just like you wanted to play edf again
[17446.08s -> 17450.56s]  We did play edf like seven or eight times. Yeah, and you said we would definitely play again
[17450.64s -> 17454.40s]  Yes, and then what happened was uh, you were going to sleep
[17454.96s -> 17458.88s]  You were going to sleep at like like 10 pm your time
[17460.85s -> 17464.37s]  Which is six what eight pm seven pm my time
[17465.57s -> 17468.93s]  You were on this schedule where you were waking up at like six o'clock in the morning
[17469.89s -> 17472.58s]  True all right true or false statement
[17472.74s -> 17477.14s]  Were you on a schedule where you were waking up at like five or six am during that time you were playing again?
[17478.40s -> 17481.52s]  Oh me and italics did we're false question me and italics did yes
[17482.40s -> 17483.20s]  Oh, yeah

[17489.20s -> 17493.12s]  Oh my god, you you wake it up at like five and go to bed at like seven
[17493.60s -> 17497.76s]  I don't believe you also you put the most useless shit in this fucking box
[17498.16s -> 17501.73s]  I
[17501.73s -> 17503.89s]  We're gonna need these 40 acorns
[17510.71s -> 17513.43s]  I told you that I didn't know what I needed to do
[17514.31s -> 17517.11s]  Because if okay, let's say I trashed those acorns
[17518.34s -> 17520.34s]  I don't know. There's like a rain hat
[17520.74s -> 17524.82s]  I don't know. What if there's probably like a scenario where you'd be like, hey, dude, uh, whatever the acorns
[17525.70s -> 17530.82s]  Acorns, I threw them away. What dude? Uh, we need to plant. Uh, I don't know. I just put everything
[17530.82s -> 17538.63s]  I don't know what I need to do
[17538.71s -> 17544.61s]  Fuck dude ice blocks worth the money. No
[17545.49s -> 17546.82s]  Okay

[17576.53s -> 17578.53s]  the starting hammer
[17580.36s -> 17582.36s]  This guy's wild
[17583.54s -> 17585.54s]  I don't know
[17589.38s -> 17591.38s]  But you can't just put me on a bike
[17592.26s -> 17596.10s]  With no training wheels and I don't know how to ride the bike and then you go. All right, son
[17596.18s -> 17598.18s]  Come on up here to the top of
[17598.74s -> 17600.74s]  the biggest hill in the town
[17601.97s -> 17605.09s]  Uh dad, I don't I should I am I ready for this? Yeah
[17607.03s -> 17611.75s]  And then just let me go with no training wheels going straight down like 70 miles per hour. We're ready
[17616.10s -> 17618.64s]  I was not ready
[17618.64s -> 17624.64s]  There's an immediate cut after you let go and I i'm flying down screaming going like 75 miles per hour
[17625.28s -> 17627.28s]  Of me in a hospital bed
[17631.48s -> 17633.48s]  In like a full body cast
[17637.09s -> 17642.13s]  It's one of those one of those like comedy scenarios where i'm in like the full body cast and i'm like trying to drink soup
[17642.21s -> 17644.21s]  And it's like I can't drink the soup
[17645.76s -> 17648.08s]  He opens the chest and clicks deposit all
[17648.88s -> 17650.24s]  Oh, man
[17650.24s -> 17652.29s]  what
[17652.29s -> 17658.16s]  They're riding on you. How is it? Who knows? How would they? Oh, yeah, we're in a squad
[17660.98s -> 17665.94s]  This is literally a spongebob episode that happens to squidward. So it's so that's what i'm saying
[17666.74s -> 17669.04s]  All right, teleport to me so we can
[17672.74s -> 17675.06s]  That I did wait does that actually happen?
[17675.78s -> 17682.10s]  Does anyone have a clip of squidward eating the soup? No, that does happen
[17688.24s -> 17699.99s]  I need to see that clip. I forgot to buy musket balls again
[17701.51s -> 17705.19s]  And whose fault is that? He deposits everything in the chest you forgot every time
[17705.99s -> 17711.11s]  So let's try this one more time. What do you think?
[17712.35s -> 17714.21s]  RPG RPG
[17714.21s -> 17717.65s]  Wait, hold on just stay there. Just you just help progress. I need to watch this
[17719.09s -> 17721.09s]  That's a video I need to watch
[17721.92s -> 17723.92s]  Do you tell me am I gonna like die?
[17724.48s -> 17728.66s]  I have to watch this
[17728.66s -> 17733.70s]  Just like just protect me for just one second while I watch this i'm protecting you with all of my heart
[17749.49s -> 17751.49s]  Uh, you're so protective right now
[17769.11s -> 17771.11s]  That's not it doesn't suit
[17776.61s -> 17779.17s]  That's pretty that's close enough. All right. Thank you
[17779.89s -> 17783.94s]  All right, can we play the game lull?
[17784.90s -> 17793.46s]  All right, let's speedrun this
[17793.46s -> 17798.04s]  Okay, but I mean like a jeremy speedrun not a star speedrun
[17799.32s -> 17801.64s]  Okay, so like a normal person's pace
[17804.95s -> 17806.95s]  Oh
[17808.63s -> 17812.74s]  What's that horn that everybody uses them that funny meme horn
[17813.54s -> 17818.53s]  the one that goes
[17818.53s -> 17820.80s]  Defeated what I do
[17820.80s -> 17830.15s]  Not down there. I am hungry, dude
[17831.62s -> 17833.62s]  Like come on, dude
[17834.69s -> 17836.69s]  You're making me play like come on, dude
[17837.49s -> 17839.33s]  Hey you
[17839.33s -> 17845.33s]  Let's just be really really clear about this you invited me to play this you were like hey play terraria with me
[17845.41s -> 17846.93s]  I'm like, okay
[17846.93s -> 17848.45s]  And now you're like
[17848.45s -> 17852.37s]  No, I don't want to do this anymore. Well now i've streamed for eight hours
[17853.25s -> 17855.25s]  And i've streamed for more than
[17855.33s -> 17857.33s]  More than four days in a row
[17857.33s -> 17861.65s]  Have you really?
[17861.65s -> 17862.69s]  Yeah
[17863.01s -> 17866.77s]  Wasn't there like a string of star streams or you only streaming like once a week
[17867.73s -> 17869.89s]  Are you back to like star streams every day now?
[17871.51s -> 17875.43s]  I don't know. I feel like i've streamed for two weeks, but that's definitely not true
[17876.87s -> 17881.20s]  That's the right clip. Uh, I watched it after we beat the dungeon
[17888.10s -> 17891.62s]  I think it's been like 10 000 days actually. Did you throw your schedule away, too?
[17892.74s -> 17896.52s]  My stream schedule. Yeah
[17896.68s -> 17898.68s]  I haven't had one in a very long time
[17899.24s -> 17900.12s]  Yeah
[17900.12s -> 17905.62s]  I like it better
[17905.62s -> 17910.50s]  I have like an estimation of what I think i'm going to do when I think i'm gonna stream
[17911.30s -> 17914.44s]  But no one really knows
[17914.52s -> 17916.52s]  I don't even tell people that
[17916.52s -> 17921.08s]  So what you just like turn it you don't have like a way for people to know when you might stream
[17922.50s -> 17924.18s]  Because that's how I do it here
[17924.18s -> 17926.18s]  It's like oh I I might stream
[17927.06s -> 17931.30s]  Like no, that's not true. Like I have like a day to advance usually a couple days in a row
[17931.86s -> 17937.83s]  I have like I don't know command. I have to ask my chat. Do you guys know what i'm gonna stream?
[17938.79s -> 17942.95s]  Answer. Oh, I know
[17942.95s -> 17946.40s]  Do I you don't have your summons?
[17949.22s -> 17951.22s]  um, but did I
[17951.54s -> 17954.50s]  Deposit my I think I deposited my oh, here you go. Take this
[17956.40s -> 17958.40s]  The room was torn in half by what?
[17960.96s -> 17966.40s]  Oh, I forgot to give you the hook
[17966.72s -> 17968.08s]  Yeah
[17968.08s -> 17971.44s]  Take that equip it and I think it's default. The button is e
[17973.14s -> 17975.33s]  e
[17975.33s -> 17978.61s]  Okay. Yeah, so like if you jump the dot like attached to the spikes
[17979.01s -> 17982.13s]  But if you jump and attach the ceiling it resets your jump
[17983.01s -> 17985.01s]  That's uh, really great
[17985.01s -> 17987.28s]  I wish I had one of these
[17987.28s -> 17989.28s]  You do
[17990.56s -> 17998.05s]  And you said thank you
[18009.43s -> 18013.83s]  Okay, i'm gonna give this to you now because I made this mistake with ashley i'm giving you
[18014.95s -> 18016.95s]  wormhole potion
[18016.95s -> 18018.95s]  What potion wormhole potion?
[18019.35s -> 18020.63s]  When you die
[18020.63s -> 18021.91s]  Thanks
[18021.91s -> 18024.47s]  And I thanks for reminding me i'm going to take the night out potion
[18026.53s -> 18030.53s]  Did that do anything it really doesn't do much
[18035.80s -> 18042.52s]  Why would you make my
[18044.34s -> 18046.74s]  Did you if you drink more than one or two of these does it work better?
[18047.86s -> 18049.54s]  I don't think so
[18049.54s -> 18066.90s]  I love this weapon. Yeah, because it sounds like you when you talk
[18071.52s -> 18077.04s]  Uh, all right, I can I know I know we're getting to that point where you're like done streaming
[18079.04s -> 18080.88s]  Because
[18080.88s -> 18087.28s]  Because every other comment is like stupid. Yeah, I don't you I hate your voice. Yeah, you're ugly
[18088.71s -> 18091.06s]  Ow
[18091.06s -> 18092.98s]  Oh my god
[18092.98s -> 18095.22s]  Did you give me the potions?
[18095.22s -> 18099.59s]  I did also fun fact. You uh, you can pick x those spikes
[18104.79s -> 18110.56s]  I don't think you gave me the potion. I had 100. Yes, you did. Thank god. You are 100 accurate
[18111.57s -> 18116.32s]  Okay, go get my gold
[18116.64s -> 18121.38s]  I can tell you're done because of how bossy you're being right now. Well, that's a huge map
[18124.61s -> 18130.18s]  That's actually a medium map
[18130.26s -> 18136.54s]  I have returned. I'm just like follow references
[18146.69s -> 18149.86s]  Your summons your summons dear
[18150.74s -> 18152.58s]  I know I
[18152.58s -> 18154.50s]  Look, I just got back
[18154.50s -> 18158.26s]  Uh, did you forget to touch the bewitching table dear? I did not there are two
[18161.59s -> 18165.96s]  Are you sure?
[18165.96s -> 18168.26s]  All right, why are you destroying this?
[18168.26s -> 18171.30s]  Because your gold was over there and I didn't want to walk across spikes like you did
[18174.48s -> 18176.96s]  You got hit by you got hit twice too. All right
[18177.60s -> 18179.36s]  And perfect
[18179.36s -> 18181.36s]  Yeah, because you had more hp than I did
[18194.36s -> 18195.32s]  What's
[18195.32s -> 18209.49s]  Can they hit us to the ground?
[18209.49s -> 18212.29s]  Very cool to try and open this box. I'm not gonna touch that box
[18212.93s -> 18217.96s]  All right. We've made it to the point where we last were killed. No, we weren't we didn't
[18218.84s -> 18221.24s]  You're right. We went down. You're absolutely right
[18225.41s -> 18227.41s]  I've actually never been wrong on my stream before
[18230.48s -> 18231.92s]  I don't know if you know that
[18231.92s -> 18238.95s]  We said lol, how are they still in the dungeon and that person that no backseat gaming?
[18239.83s -> 18269.09s]  When was the last time that you were backseat gamed for real? Not just like oh
[18270.05s -> 18271.73s]  not real, um
[18271.73s -> 18275.65s]  Ashley showed me a funny picture the other day. I mean maybe it was this morning
[18276.21s -> 18281.25s]  Where someone like had police surrounding their house and they actually threw like tear gas in their room
[18281.89s -> 18286.21s]  What and the the screenshot of the chat was them all backseating what they should be doing
[18286.85s -> 18290.69s]  Like get milk. It'll make your eyes stop burning from the gas like i'll do this like
[18291.57s -> 18293.57s]  Every single comment was backseat
[18294.77s -> 18297.33s]  The presence of running around their house not even looking at the computer
[18299.67s -> 18305.03s]  So to answer your question, uh, when was the last time I was backseated every day all day
[18306.55s -> 18312.87s]  How how what else is there? What's the other option? I kind of need to respond to how how absolutely fucked up what you just said is
[18313.59s -> 18314.39s]  Yeah
[18314.39s -> 18315.99s]  No, it's pretty fucked
[18315.99s -> 18317.99s]  That's fucking horrible. Um
[18318.47s -> 18319.59s]  but
[18319.59s -> 18321.59s]  Every day you're backseated
[18324.08s -> 18330.82s]  Yeah, but like no i'm not talking about like you you should have pressed your alt in overwatch like faster
[18330.90s -> 18333.22s]  Like somebody was really like trying to teach you how to play a game
[18333.78s -> 18335.78s]  Because you already know how to play overwatch
[18336.39s -> 18338.39s]  A game that you like maybe didn't know
[18338.47s -> 18340.47s]  What like every day?
[18341.51s -> 18344.73s]  I mean, doesn't that make it worse for you saying you already know how to play overwatching
[18344.73s -> 18346.73s]  And
[18347.77s -> 18351.69s]  But that's that's not backseat gaming that's just like somebody being like
[18352.49s -> 18354.49s]  Mean about how bad you played
[18355.13s -> 18359.99s]  Are they one in the same? Not really
[18361.43s -> 18363.43s]  They think I did something wrong, but I didn't
[18367.80s -> 18373.08s]  Like like today when people were telling me that those the houses weren't working because I wasn't making doors
[18373.72s -> 18375.80s]  Is that backseating and then it was today?
[18379.26s -> 18380.86s]  Every day
[18380.94s -> 18382.94s]  There there was today's
[18384.52s -> 18386.52s]  One of see you just
[18386.60s -> 18389.24s]  You don't read your chat enough. It's going too fast. I know
[18390.12s -> 18391.72s]  All the time
[18391.72s -> 18393.72s]  I read my chat all the time
[18394.60s -> 18398.76s]  Why would you type out something he should do? You know, it's a waste of your time
[18401.62s -> 18407.14s]  By the time like he reads like two words like 16 jupiters would have gone by
[18412.46s -> 18416.63s]  Uh
[18416.63s -> 18418.55s]  I paid very much
[18418.55s -> 18422.55s]  One would say the reason why I have so much trouble sometimes in games is because I am
[18423.43s -> 18425.11s]  engaging with the chat
[18425.11s -> 18428.55s]  More than I saw you playing against the pig yesterday
[18429.59s -> 18434.07s]  Or instead of playing the game you were reading the chat talking about how a baseball player would never do that
[18435.35s -> 18436.31s]  Yes
[18436.31s -> 18440.07s]  I was there. You know what you were I didn't know you were there. I would have said what's up
[18443.35s -> 18447.45s]  Every time you've seen me in real life, you've actually spit on me like first interaction
[18449.27s -> 18454.09s]  Now you miss understanding that I I I do I do chewing tobacco
[18455.19s -> 18460.47s]  It's just you might you might do every time you walk up to me. I just might be getting I'd expect it's not
[18461.19s -> 18463.19s]  It's not i'm spitting like at you or anything
[18463.83s -> 18465.83s]  I just show up at a bad time
[18466.79s -> 18469.64s]  What was that stat? Uh you picked it up
[18471.28s -> 18472.74s]  treacherous
[18472.74s -> 18474.44s]  sphere
[18474.44s -> 18476.44s]  Someone's a treacherous spear
[18477.40s -> 18479.00s]  What?
[18479.08s -> 18481.08s]  57 melee damage on this
[18481.80s -> 18483.40s]  really nice
[18483.40s -> 18489.00s]  Good in my small escape of this game would I have knowledge of the last few hours like at this point?
[18489.08s -> 18491.08s]  The highest i'm seeing are like 30s
[18492.36s -> 18494.36s]  But also it's one of the awkward weapons. I don't want to use
[18495.40s -> 18497.96s]  What if it does that much damage? I don't give a shit
[18498.12s -> 18504.68s]  Remember that deleted germa or star video where they met in real life and germa punched him in the face
[18507.03s -> 18510.95s]  And we like we've gotten over that so that's why the video is that's why the video was deleted
[18511.35s -> 18513.35s]  Because we've like kind of gotten over that
[18513.83s -> 18518.28s]  There's a lot of enemies over here. I mean like too many for me to handle
[18519.08s -> 18522.28s]  I'm coming with my 57 godly mace
[18523.24s -> 18525.24s]  That sphere is amazing. Should I give it a try?
[18530.55s -> 18536.22s]  Whoa, it does it shoots the things that I shoot. Wait, what did you get? Oh
[18537.90s -> 18544.54s]  I got double like shooting stars now. Oh, is that your does that count? Hey chat does that count as a sentry?
[18546.38s -> 18548.86s]  That's pretty nice
[18548.86s -> 18550.86s]  That's amazing
[18553.35s -> 18556.63s]  Yeah, there's some equipment later where you'll be able to have like four of those out
[18557.51s -> 18559.69s]  I gotta put this in it. This is like
[18560.17s -> 18562.57s]  It's broken. I don't know what it's doing. It's doing it through the walls
[18569.59s -> 18571.59s]  Wow, you win the internet
[18576.04s -> 18578.04s]  Oh, I hate that
[18578.68s -> 18582.28s]  That's like the worst thing that's the worst thing ever i've got one too
[18583.80s -> 18585.80s]  Oh man, you win the internet. Oh
[18592.38s -> 18594.38s]  But you have one too
[18595.75s -> 18599.83s]  This is fun. I gotta see I told you you should have stayed for an extra like 10 minutes
[18600.79s -> 18602.79s]  Yeah, otherwise we wouldn't have gotten
[18604.58s -> 18608.28s]  The uber gear from the uber dungeon
[18613.45s -> 18616.01s]  Are we farming for anything in particular or are we just kind of sitting around?
[18616.81s -> 18618.97s]  um golden keys so that
[18619.77s -> 18621.77s]  We open one of these chests and get a shadow key
[18623.26s -> 18624.46s]  interesting
[18624.46s -> 18626.46s]  Is what I want
[18626.78s -> 18639.10s]  If you only need one shadow key to open every shadow chest after that and there's a whole bunch of them on the far left
[18639.10s -> 18641.10s]  side of the map
[18641.10s -> 18643.10s]  There's so much shit down here
[18646.39s -> 18648.89s]  Uh, there's a key right there
[18648.89s -> 18653.18s]  Where I got one is this one is this uh chest not open?
[18654.38s -> 18657.74s]  Uh, the chest is locked up. I feel it looks different
[18659.35s -> 18661.35s]  Now i've already opened this one's open already
[18661.91s -> 18664.47s]  midnight oil
[18664.47s -> 18666.79s]  Silver bar magic missile. I already have one of these
[18667.51s -> 18670.55s]  I I don't know where to take it. Maybe we don't take the other magic missile
[18671.91s -> 18675.43s]  Uh, my my inventory is so full. Mine's pretty full, too
[18677.62s -> 18679.62s]  I bet germa has read it open right now
[18680.18s -> 18692.09s]  No, I don't
[18694.65s -> 18708.50s]  Turn on screen capture right now. No, all right. Let's keep going. I think it's still good
[18715.59s -> 18719.11s]  Can you cast it real quick
[18719.11s -> 18724.07s]  I think we can only have one between us, which is doesn't make any sense. That's odd that they
[18726.90s -> 18729.53s]  Seems like a patch
[18729.53s -> 18736.58s]  Like this has been patched
[18736.58s -> 18739.38s]  How much further down are we going? This is really far down
[18740.34s -> 18752.92s]  jump with that thing
[18752.92s -> 18755.00s]  Ancient necro helmet. I didn't know those
[18757.72s -> 18763.72s]  Update my facebook page. I have not logged into that germa 95 facebook in probably five years
[18764.20s -> 18770.63s]  I don't use facebook. Did you just throw that sword away?
[18771.91s -> 18773.11s]  No
[18773.11s -> 18784.39s]  If you follow germa on facebook the cool thing about it is that you get to be one of the germs
[18786.68s -> 18790.84s]  Yeah, no, my favorite part is when I join star's congregation of smashing gents
[18792.28s -> 18799.40s]  My favorite part is when I clearly make the mistake of naming my group that and then you name yours something even worse after me
[18800.84s -> 18802.12s]  uh
[18802.12s -> 18805.50s]  What was yours the inhumane psychopath?
[18808.36s -> 18815.64s]  Fun fact fun fact. Yes fun fact years later. I determined how fucking terrible and awful of a name that is
[18816.68s -> 18820.52s]  That I I tried to delete it, but you can't delete groups
[18821.58s -> 18826.14s]  valve remember we talked about valve has like 2019 paint with the 2005 engine
[18827.26s -> 18829.26s]  You cannot delete a group
[18829.67s -> 18832.47s]  If you make a steam group do it right now and have a hundred people join
[18833.03s -> 18836.07s]  All of them have to leave before you delete it. It can't be deleted
[18844.22s -> 18851.02s]  That's why I support the epic steam store epic steams steam steams steams steam
[18855.02s -> 18857.02s]  All right, I don't want to die down here
[18859.24s -> 18861.75s]  Steam
[18861.75s -> 18863.75s]  Uh, did you open that chest?
[18864.07s -> 18868.71s]  This one over here is not open that I don't have anything in here. I I couldn't even see what isn't being attacked
[18870.87s -> 18873.51s]  That's some stupid staff. It's a it's a shitty stuff
[18875.35s -> 18877.03s]  Uh, but anyways
[18877.03s -> 18878.79s]  Yes, I realized
[18878.79s -> 18884.41s]  Yours was congregation of smashing gents and I was like, oh i'll have mine be the inhumane psychopath
[18888.50s -> 18890.50s]  I can't remember why it was
[18891.80s -> 18894.36s]  Someone started it and was not me. I think it might have been shivvy
[18895.24s -> 18897.48s]  Of just like having really stupid group names
[18898.68s -> 18904.92s]  It's like shivvy's club of awesome. I believe is what it is. If that is correct, I might be wrong, but it might be
[18905.80s -> 18907.80s]  I think it is someone else
[18912.47s -> 18918.95s]  No one has a group name though, I can tell you that i'm sorry, but I I think I was against the uh, the grain there
[18919.91s -> 18922.89s]  with my group name
[18922.89s -> 18925.13s]  Inhumane psychopaths, you're very proud of that
[18925.37s -> 18931.77s]  No, i'm just saying it wasn't like the smashing gents or the the cool group or the cool group of dudes
[18932.41s -> 18934.41s]  Okay
[18934.57s -> 18936.33s]  Good job
[18936.33s -> 18938.49s]  Good job. So I made another group
[18939.45s -> 18941.21s]  Because I was like, I don't like that group that groups
[18941.21s -> 18944.17s]  I don't like that name and I want to like make i'm gonna actually do stuff with this group
[18944.57s -> 18946.57s]  And I changed it to even worse
[18947.05s -> 18949.05s]  What do you think I changed it to?
[18949.90s -> 18953.08s]  I don't remember I went so
[18953.86s -> 18955.00s]  generic
[18955.00s -> 18957.00s]  Just safe name
[18962.01s -> 18964.01s]  Jerma's group. Yes
[18964.26s -> 18966.26s]  Really
[18966.50s -> 18971.62s]  I don't know. I I was I don't know. I I went from one extreme to the other
[18975.48s -> 18980.04s]  I don't think that steam group has a name. I think it's just jerma's group
[18980.76s -> 18987.29s]  Can we even cut through this place?
[18988.28s -> 18990.44s]  Uh, I don't think our pickaxes can do that yet
[18991.40s -> 18993.40s]  Oh, no, I can and then I
[18994.52s -> 18997.72s]  I haven't used that group and I can't remove it people like hey dude
[18997.80s -> 19000.92s]  You're like your steam group's like all fucked up and there's a bunch of like dumb shit
[19001.00s -> 19005.00s]  And it's like all kinds of like crazy like discussions that have to be removed. I wish I could
[19008.66s -> 19011.14s]  Steam does not allow me to delete these groups
[19012.02s -> 19017.62s]  And like having a steam group that can be posted on just means there's going to be like a whole bunch of people speaking
[19017.70s -> 19023.94s]  Russian and saying like weird shit all the time or just like virus links. Yeah virus links and like
[19024.50s -> 19026.71s]  Like
[19026.71s -> 19030.47s]  And then I was like, oh I have moderators a long time ago, by the way
[19030.47s -> 19032.47s]  This is at least five years ago four or five years ago
[19033.35s -> 19037.67s]  Maybe you should have moderators for that and then it would just be impossible to keep up with
[19042.62s -> 19046.14s]  Can we not break through these? I guess we can we can
[19049.99s -> 19054.28s]  We're almost at the bottom of it
[19054.28s -> 19055.72s]  I'm digging down
[19055.72s -> 19062.04s]  Let's go to hell, but let's earn it this time
[19072.12s -> 19074.12s]  Uh, oh, uh, yeah, don't let him in here
[19076.98s -> 19079.14s]  Keep digging. Hold on. I need to like protect us
[19084.42s -> 19086.42s]  Those shadow keys never found one
[19100.31s -> 19102.63s]  We have to earn our hell is what they're saying
[19103.27s -> 19106.57s]  Earn your hell
[19106.57s -> 19108.41s]  What is that?
[19108.41s -> 19110.41s]  Why is it is that helping us mine?
[19111.13s -> 19116.71s]  No
[19116.71s -> 19120.52s]  Oh god
[19120.52s -> 19125.64s]  Do you see that thing below us? Yeah, what about it? If we kill it the wall of flesh will summon. Let's do it
[19126.20s -> 19130.60s]  Let's no preparation wall of flesh right now. Why did you just drop that? What are you doing?
[19131.48s -> 19133.40s]  Why did you do that?
[19133.40s -> 19135.40s]  you just like
[19136.76s -> 19142.84s]  You just like dropped me out and I had like no health you better stay alive so I can teleport to you with the worm
[19143.56s -> 19145.56s]  Oh
[19149.38s -> 19162.46s]  Where did the uh, where'd the voodoo doll go? Also, this is not regular health stone. This is oh my god
[19162.78s -> 19164.78s]  Warn me. Oh my god, dude
[19171.67s -> 19173.67s]  Oh, it's because I have a dangerous sense potion
[19175.82s -> 19179.27s]  Oh
[19180.23s -> 19181.19s]  No
[19181.19s -> 19183.19s]  Are there any more of those in the inventory?
[19184.12s -> 19187.40s]  I don't I don't think so. How do I make one? How do you make them?
[19188.57s -> 19190.89s]  I don't I don't think so. Oh, I got it
[19192.57s -> 19196.09s]  I think this is where we call it. No, how do you make one?
[19197.05s -> 19198.33s]  I don't know
[19198.33s -> 19201.13s]  And we definitely don't have it because we've been deleting everything
[19207.06s -> 19209.06s]  And look, i'm not even there anymore. No
[19209.54s -> 19211.54s]  No, I wanted to see it. Oh
[19212.50s -> 19216.31s]  I didn't summon it
[19216.31s -> 19218.31s]  Oh now that we we earned it
[19218.78s -> 19220.78s]  I didn't I I guess I
[19221.58s -> 19225.82s]  I don't know why my brain just thought me teleporting over there was going to teleport me to a safe place and not just like
[19225.90s -> 19229.10s]  Where you are? I I didn't think of it either, but it was like the moment I was
[19231.05s -> 19231.93s]  Yeah
[19231.93s -> 19240.39s]  What about the cheat hole?
[19240.39s -> 19242.87s]  Cheat hole. Let's go. You can get spirit droplets right now
[19243.67s -> 19257.78s]  cheat hole
[19257.78s -> 19260.74s]  Uh, oh don't tell germa but
[19261.86s -> 19267.86s]  That you can craft the armor now that gives you two minions and the bonus is probably like a third
[19268.90s -> 19270.26s]  Shouldn't have told me
[19270.26s -> 19280.82s]  All right. So where should we be stopping?
[19280.90s -> 19287.06s]  Just right here what we were last time
[19289.06s -> 19291.06s]  Um, wait, what do you mean?
[19291.14s -> 19295.00s]  down the cheat hole
[19295.00s -> 19298.65s]  I think I think we should stop
[19298.65s -> 19302.49s]  Oh, you see because we are very close to you getting okay number one
[19302.49s -> 19308.33s]  It's a 38 damage ghost summon and then you can summon like a whole like ghost necromancer
[19309.69s -> 19311.61s]  Minion set
[19311.61s -> 19313.77s]  There's a whole like we could all go and do that
[19314.33s -> 19318.41s]  But if we do it now, then you're not going to play next week and we can make saturday terraria day
[19319.45s -> 19321.53s]  And you you want to keep saturday terraria night?
[19322.09s -> 19323.53s]  Terraria day day
[19323.53s -> 19325.53s]  Terraria day, okay
[19325.61s -> 19331.85s]  I'm gonna do it
[19331.85s -> 19337.72s]  Ow bill my wife is saying wall in all cap
[19339.16s -> 19341.24s]  No, no, no wall
[19342.52s -> 19344.52s]  Maybe ignore her ignore her
[19346.36s -> 19351.56s]  Das fridays terraria saturdays that's gonna have to change. What is going on over here?
[19352.76s -> 19354.76s]  This leaf shield thing. What is this?
[19355.96s -> 19358.12s]  Uh when enemies are near she does that
[19359.08s -> 19361.08s]  Oh, and it's like a hell for jen
[19362.60s -> 19364.60s]  Yeah, I I will play terraria again
[19365.80s -> 19367.80s]  Definitely interesting enough to do it again
[19368.44s -> 19370.84s]  You haven't even gotten a hard mode yet kid. I know
[19373.74s -> 19377.45s]  fucking kid
[19377.45s -> 19379.45s]  But yeah, um
[19384.95s -> 19386.15s]  That's it, right?
[19386.15s -> 19388.63s]  Yeah, now it's just the only thing left to do is talk political
[19389.91s -> 19391.91s]  Well, the only thing left to do is
[19392.47s -> 19394.63s]  Five and a half hours like five to six hours. That's that's good
[19397.90s -> 19400.86s]  This is a bonus stream for me it's a regular stream for you
[19405.37s -> 19407.37s]  Hold on. There's like get those stars
[19407.99s -> 19409.59s]  so how does
[19409.59s -> 19413.90s]  So if I take this character into my own terraria game, it's going to be just empty, right?
[19414.70s -> 19417.10s]  Yep, this is on your local drive, right?
[19420.86s -> 19425.66s]  If I open a new terraria game, just not multiplayer will I have to be a level zero?
[19426.70s -> 19430.22s]  Shitty you can join with that with this character again
[19430.38s -> 19434.06s]  But everything in that world will need to be done again like how we feed it
[19434.06s -> 19438.94s]  The skeleton gets to go into the dungeon like that hasn't happened in that world. You have to beat him again
[19439.34s -> 19441.34s]  If you want to continue playing
[19441.90s -> 19443.90s]  I can just like leave it open
[19445.26s -> 19449.18s]  Uh, no, I probably i'm just gonna i'm gonna like do some reading
[19450.14s -> 19452.44s]  I'm gonna mana crystal. So
[19453.24s -> 19463.96s]  My max metal if you can't use them. Yeah, then give me the ones you haven't used
[19465.66s -> 19470.22s]  I'm gonna do a little bit of reading so i'm more knowledgeable next time at least like by two percent
[19472.20s -> 19474.04s]  Okay
[19474.04s -> 19478.92s]  And do you do you actually want to do this again like on saturday like next saturday just do no
[19478.92s -> 19481.08s]  I was I was joking. Well, I don't know
[19481.72s -> 19486.68s]  Sometimes you say things and then you you you write like in discord after the streams of it
[19486.68s -> 19488.76s]  You write like you really think that i'm gonna play with you
[19490.76s -> 19492.76s]  That's definitely happened
[19493.48s -> 19497.16s]  And then I have to pretend like oh no something that something came up. I don't know what happened
[19499.10s -> 19501.10s]  All right. Well, i'll i'll just see you later
[19502.63s -> 19505.35s]  Have a well-deserved rest after eight hours stream
[19506.31s -> 19508.31s]  Thank you, honey
[19508.76s -> 19512.84s]  Oh my god, I hear more stars and you didn't give me the mana crystal that you didn't use I just threw out
[19512.92s -> 19514.20s]  Yes, I did
[19514.20s -> 19516.12s]  I just gave it to you
[19516.12s -> 19518.12s]  No, you did I threw it right down
[19519.93s -> 19521.93s]  I want more
[19522.01s -> 19524.01s]  I will see you guys. Um later
[19524.57s -> 19526.09s]  we'll do the
[19526.09s -> 19528.09s]  the end of the stream here, but
[19528.09s -> 19529.53s]  Goodbye star
[19529.53s -> 19531.37s]  Always a pleasure
[19531.37s -> 19533.05s]  We'll see you next time
[19533.05s -> 19535.05s]  for terraria
[19535.13s -> 19539.86s]  He's still on the call. I thought he's gonna do his thing that he does
[19540.26s -> 19542.26s]  No
[19542.26s -> 19543.70s]  I don't do anything
[19543.70s -> 19545.46s]  Where you just you're gone
[19545.54s -> 19550.74s]  I'm going are you actually gonna say goodbye to my stream for the first time in like four streams
[19551.78s -> 19557.14s]  Goodbye germa's stream. I hope that you had I hope you enjoyed the playthrough of terraria
[19557.70s -> 19561.46s]  And I hope you look forward to the continuing episodes that will result from it
[19562.18s -> 19563.62s]  I don't think
[19563.62s -> 19568.66s]  You have ever done that in at least the last like seven streams. You've always just kind of been gone somehow
[19569.94s -> 19571.14s]  There you go
[19571.14s -> 19573.14s]  I think you're wrong. I'm not
[19574.15s -> 19578.95s]  I think I left one time as a joke. No the last three or four times. It's been a joke
[19581.35s -> 19583.59s]  You and you've even turned your stream off
[19584.63s -> 19587.67s]  And like ceased all contact for the rest of the day
[19588.31s -> 19592.54s]  You dedicated i'll give you that
[19593.56s -> 19596.28s]  Uh lang says germa usually mutes me. Oh, okay
[19598.23s -> 19599.19s]  Thank you
[19599.19s -> 19600.97s]  You're not muted now, are you?
[19600.97s -> 19604.65s]  All right. Well, goodbye. I don't do I have to how many times do I have to do it? Are you satisfied?
[19605.37s -> 19611.29s]  One more we'll do it. I think goodbye germa and germa's chat. I hope you enjoyed this. We'll play again
[19611.69s -> 19616.83s]  Goodbye star and stars when I say things it's not a joke and i'm not sarcastic
[19617.69s -> 19620.25s]  Actually mean the thing
[19620.25s -> 19624.01s]  So I 100 mean it when I say what about hillary's emails?
[19631.80s -> 19633.80s]  I'm like just realizing right now that like that
[19634.60s -> 19639.00s]  That that joke that came up like four or five times would have been funny like three years ago
[19643.70s -> 19645.70s]  what we were on that for like
[19646.62s -> 19651.43s]  At least 10 minutes. All right, give me the spongebob soup thing
[19667.82s -> 19669.82s]  There's even a time stick
[19671.50s -> 19674.22s]  This is it i'm so ready for this you have no idea
[19676.62s -> 19678.78s]  I've never been more ready for something in my whole life
[19679.34s -> 19690.39s]  Why is it not showing?
[19691.11s -> 19694.39s]  How about some soup on your best day ever?
[19698.14s -> 19700.14s]  It's a little hot
[19700.54s -> 19704.31s]  Oh
[19707.67s -> 19711.83s]  I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever
[19713.03s -> 19715.03s]  How about some music on your best day ever?
[19716.63s -> 19718.63s]  Music isn't best either
[19718.63s -> 19725.83s]  But what is best is what we save for last the one surefire thing to make your best day ever
[19726.31s -> 19745.88s]  All right, that's enough. I'm gonna get in trouble. That's enough. What a cliffhanger. Just you go watch that episode if you want to see what happens
[19748.04s -> 19750.23s]  But i'll see you guys later
[19750.23s -> 19752.87s]  I will be back in a few days
[19754.86s -> 19756.86s]  I think we're gonna start next week
[19757.50s -> 19758.70s]  with
[19758.70s -> 19762.10s]  The gta casino
[19762.10s -> 19764.26s]  It came out. I kind of have to play that
[19765.37s -> 19767.93s]  How could I not do the gta online casino?
[19785.91s -> 19786.95s]  when
[19786.95s -> 19788.95s]  So this would be let's say saturday
[19789.75s -> 19794.55s]  Sunday monday, but we'll come back on wednesday. We'll do the same thing. We did this last week here
[19795.51s -> 19799.14s]  We'll do a like wednesday
[19799.78s -> 19802.82s]  I don't have a schedule but wednesday to saturday sounds like
[19803.54s -> 19805.78s]  Especially with this new terraria saturday thing
[19806.58s -> 19809.98s]  wednesday thursday friday saturday
[19810.55s -> 19820.06s]  Same thing we did this week saturday whisper dos. Well, we can't we have to change that up
[19820.78s -> 19825.54s]  Why am I gonna say hey star? No, we we're playing uh terraria on fridays now
[19826.42s -> 19828.50s]  Uh, it's it says he he invited me
[19829.30s -> 19831.22s]  You don't switch that around
[19831.22s -> 19836.66s]  You know, you don't go to somebody's house when they invite you to their house and then like change their decorations and move their furniture around
[19847.37s -> 19849.80s]  You if you do
[19849.80s -> 19852.06s]  Don't do that anymore
[19852.06s -> 19854.06s]  But i'll see you guys on wednesday
[19856.07s -> 19857.59s]  Thanks for watching
[19857.59s -> 19860.26s]  Terraria is actually pretty fun
[19860.26s -> 19865.94s]  It's uh, I get to experience this because I never really i've tried to open it up a couple times. I got it on ipad
[19866.50s -> 19868.34s]  weirdly enough
[19868.34s -> 19871.54s]  And maybe put like 30 minutes into it before I realized I needed to
[19872.18s -> 19875.30s]  Put a lot of time into it and I really didn't want to lie in bed
[19876.02s -> 19878.34s]  It's like five six seven straight hours
[19878.90s -> 19884.98s]  Playing it on ipad
[19884.98s -> 19887.22s]  So I was I don't really want to do this and then I never did it
[19887.86s -> 19889.86s]  I never really got into it. I didn't
[19890.18s -> 19893.06s]  Put the time that is necessary to get something out of it
[19898.23s -> 19902.23s]  I don't know. Maybe then maybe we'll see if anybody else wants to along the way jumped in and play it or something
[19912.97s -> 19918.04s]  You know, but we we're gonna do the bits
[19918.68s -> 19920.44s]  Shouldn't take us too long
[19920.82s -> 19922.42s]  Is the stream over? Yeah
[19922.42s -> 19925.38s]  I think that's a pretty good. I don't really have anything that i'd want to start
[19928.07s -> 19929.67s]  Five and a half hours in
[19929.67s -> 19932.76s]  I'd rather just uh start pressure on wednesday
[19935.38s -> 19937.38s]  Why can't I play good games?
[19937.38s -> 19939.78s]  Isn't terraria one of like the most critically acclaimed
[19940.58s -> 19942.58s]  Games like that that exists
[19947.80s -> 19950.10s]  What it is, right?
[19952.07s -> 19957.83s]  Uh, if you would ask somebody is terraria a good game, I would say probably eight or nine out of ten people would probably say yes
[19959.77s -> 19962.17s]  Isn't that as not a good what classifies a good game?
[19967.32s -> 19969.72s]  How many people buy it? How many people review it? How many?
[19970.28s -> 19985.05s]  I don't know
[19985.05s -> 19986.41s]  But let's go back
[19986.41s -> 19990.41s]  I'll see you guys on wednesday. Thanks for watching call to personality. Thanks for the two dollars fifty cents
[19991.75s -> 19996.47s]  I'm playing shadow run with friends. So i'll have to watch the vod wanted to send bits your way anyway
[19997.27s -> 19999.83s]  Enjoy the game with your buds build lots of
[20000.39s -> 20001.51s]  uh
[20001.51s -> 20003.51s]  Call me for you. Call me block
[20004.23s -> 20006.14s]  The calm what does that mean?
[20006.14s -> 20015.77s]  the houses
[20015.77s -> 20021.19s]  oh
[20021.19s -> 20023.19s]  Why why why is that?
[20023.99s -> 20026.79s]  That's just what you that's what you you just put people in like
[20028.90s -> 20033.96s]  the shoe box
[20033.96s -> 20035.96s]  I would just let them roam free
[20040.46s -> 20043.10s]  Hey halios. Thanks for 280. Happy birthday germa
[20044.98s -> 20056.50s]  You're a little a little off, but uh, thank you so much. Appreciate it. We had a lot of money come in earlier. We
[20057.30s -> 20062.42s]  grabbed them all but thank you to uh timmy and chunky baloney for your 50 dollar
[20063.06s -> 20065.06s]  Bit donations that came in a few hours ago
[20065.54s -> 20067.54s]  It's a lot of fucking money. Thank you
[20072.50s -> 20075.94s]  The continued generosity of some of you guys is mind-blowing
[20078.04s -> 20083.48s]  No one's under any obligation to pay this stream any money ever yet. Some people do a lot and
[20084.20s -> 20086.28s]  I just thank you. I wish there was more I could say
[20095.75s -> 20097.75s]  But let's uh do the credits
[20099.85s -> 20104.20s]  Throw them up there. Here they come. Here comes those quick
[20105.34s -> 20109.50s]  Use all the subs and resubs and get the subs that happened during the course of the stream
[20110.46s -> 20111.90s]  Thanks to all of you
[20111.90s -> 20115.78s]  as always
[20115.78s -> 20117.78s]  we have a few more bits to do but
[20117.94s -> 20126.10s]  Get it up there now. All right
[20126.10s -> 20128.50s]  Thank you to freudian weapon for the five dollars
[20129.54s -> 20132.42s]  Gosh darn it. Germa. You're really making me want to pick terraria back up
[20133.30s -> 20139.08s]  But on another note, do you plan on streaming mario maker 2 again? I've got a level in the works. That's sure to knock your socks off
[20142.62s -> 20145.21s]  Yeah, i'll do that next week
[20145.21s -> 20147.85s]  I'll try to do we'll do the gta casino
[20148.89s -> 20152.81s]  We'll do another sam and max episode. We'll do mario maker 2 again
[20155.02s -> 20157.02s]  And then I really want to start to
[20157.59s -> 20158.87s]  over the next
[20158.87s -> 20160.15s]  week or so
[20160.15s -> 20163.03s]  Try to get this dumb highlights magazine stream
[20163.83s -> 20165.83s]  rules and stuff started so
[20166.07s -> 20167.27s]  that'll
[20167.27s -> 20168.86s]  pretty
[20168.86s -> 20169.90s]  Pribbly
[20169.90s -> 20171.90s]  Uh come out shortly
[20172.14s -> 20188.25s]  So that's what you can expect the next week when I come back. I think i've had enough break from mario maker 2 to
[20189.27s -> 20193.02s]  Come back and lose my mind again
[20193.02s -> 20195.74s]  Uh, thank you to you. You follow up
[20196.62s -> 20198.62s]  You follow up for the five dollars
[20198.94s -> 20203.26s]  I say love the stranger, but you always make my day better but something needs to happen
[20204.22s -> 20205.72s]  About the
[20205.72s -> 20212.38s]  Trans slur arguments that happen almost every stream. It really hurts seeing such toxic debates spark from such a generous and fantastic streamer like you
[20213.10s -> 20215.50s]  Uh, love you lots jerma. Sorry about the chat misbehaving today
[20217.85s -> 20219.85s]  Yeah, honestly, I think it's
[20220.01s -> 20226.34s]  Everybody kind of just needs to relax
[20227.38s -> 20229.38s]  and there's really no reason
[20230.47s -> 20232.42s]  to
[20232.42s -> 20234.42s]  Get angry or upset about something like that
[20235.91s -> 20237.19s]  We're here
[20237.19s -> 20238.95s]  To just hang out and have a good time
[20238.95s -> 20241.32s]  We're just here to have fun. We're here to relax
[20243.11s -> 20245.11s]  It there really shouldn't be
[20245.86s -> 20250.18s]  like that kind of fighting like that in the chat and I I I don't really want to
[20250.90s -> 20255.13s]  Press too hard on this
[20255.13s -> 20257.13s]  But we're here for a very specific reason
[20259.10s -> 20260.86s]  i'm not here
[20260.86s -> 20262.06s]  to
[20262.06s -> 20263.10s]  really
[20263.10s -> 20265.42s]  Go over anything else besides us to
[20266.06s -> 20268.06s]  Forget the world around us
[20268.46s -> 20270.62s]  Enjoy a game and hang out together
[20272.65s -> 20281.19s]  Try to be nicer to each other
[20281.19s -> 20285.91s]  Now that doesn't mean well, everything has to be everything's positive everything has to be positive all day every day
[20285.91s -> 20287.91s]  Everything's positive positive positive
[20288.90s -> 20290.98s]  But being like nice to be nice to each other
[20293.27s -> 20294.95s]  We fuck around here a lot
[20294.95s -> 20296.15s]  We really do
[20296.15s -> 20304.01s]  but there's a difference between like fucking around and like being angry with each other and fucking hating each other
[20305.72s -> 20307.72s]  Now I don't think that's necessarily been
[20308.44s -> 20318.60s]  too far down there, but this stream is
[20319.70s -> 20321.70s]  a very very very
[20322.55s -> 20325.35s]  I don't really talk about
[20325.35s -> 20327.35s]  what I believe in
[20327.51s -> 20331.27s]  The things that I care about in politics, maybe the politics joke earlier, right?
[20331.27s -> 20336.23s]  But we like that and this is obviously politics and social issues. I don't really do that
[20345.64s -> 20349.80s]  If there's ever an avenue for us to really start to discuss those things then that's when it'll happen
[20356.31s -> 20361.50s]  But try to be like better to each other and nicer to each other
[20361.98s -> 20364.54s]  We don't have to have these big arguments like that in chat
[20365.18s -> 20368.01s]  and I try to
[20368.01s -> 20370.97s]  Because here's another part right once you start to I don't want to fan
[20371.69s -> 20374.65s]  The flames because you know, obviously putting it in sub only is easy to uh
[20375.29s -> 20377.85s]  To kind of oh, but let's just like cool it down for a little bit
[20378.73s -> 20400.25s]  Yeah, well, that's why I said that's why I separated
[20401.77s -> 20404.89s]  Stuff like politics from like social issues and like
[20405.61s -> 20407.77s]  You mentioned like human rights issues, right?
[20410.18s -> 20412.18s]  You can't like lump everything together
[20413.88s -> 20421.64s]  Because they're they're very different
[20421.64s -> 20425.24s]  And in the rules there are I have rules here
[20425.72s -> 20427.96s]  At the bottom of the stream
[20427.96s -> 20429.96s]  It does very clearly say
[20429.96s -> 20432.76s]  Don't talk about politics. Don't talk about any
[20433.88s -> 20435.16s]  bigot shit
[20435.16s -> 20437.18s]  No racist shit
[20437.18s -> 20439.18s]  I really feel like I don't have to say that
[20442.66s -> 20446.10s]  Just like just relax a little we don't have to do that here
[20453.94s -> 20456.12s]  I can't
[20456.12s -> 20459.21s]  Tell you
[20459.21s -> 20460.73s]  What to think?
[20460.73s -> 20464.01s]  I can't tell you what to believe. I can't tell you how to live your life
[20465.43s -> 20466.23s]  But
[20466.23s -> 20469.35s]  All I can tell you is at least try to respect the people around you
[20469.99s -> 20473.26s]  To a point where everybody that everybody deserves
[20474.14s -> 20476.14s]  Just for being a person in the first place
[20482.86s -> 20484.86s]  That's not the intention of these streams
[20499.85s -> 20503.69s]  I'm not a person of multi-billion dollar corporation. Jeremiah 985
[20505.21s -> 20516.22s]  Are we allowed to hate you?
[20519.67s -> 20522.39s]  Like I said, I can't change somebody's mind. I can't tell you
[20523.19s -> 20525.32s]  to like not
[20525.32s -> 20527.80s]  Be a certain way. I can want that to be the case
[20528.52s -> 20537.30s]  But we all gotta we all gotta exist here
[20539.06s -> 20539.94s]  just
[20539.94s -> 20542.98s]  Respect your peers here. There's no reason for it
[20543.54s -> 20550.31s]  That's not what we're doing here
[20550.31s -> 20551.27s]  anyways
[20551.27s -> 20553.58s]  I feel like i've made a pretty
[20556.22s -> 20560.30s]  Big statement here about I don't really talk. I don't really talk about this kind of stuff
[20561.10s -> 20563.10s]  ever really I mean ever
[20564.31s -> 20569.30s]  And there's a reason for it. I hopefully I could at least make that point somewhat clear
[20579.10s -> 20580.66s]  but
[20580.66s -> 20587.46s]  Regardless of any of this
[20587.46s -> 20596.76s]  Thank you with five dollars appreciate it. You underestimate how addicted he is to gambling
[20602.62s -> 20604.62s]  I'm not that addicted to gambling
[20606.01s -> 20621.38s]  It's fun. Sometimes in a fake video game. He moved to vegas
[20622.55s -> 20625.51s]  Yeah, but that there are casinos here. Guess what there are casinos in
[20626.63s -> 20628.63s]  In the new in new england, too
[20629.51s -> 20637.34s]  They just opened up one boston or yeah boston just brought in one of the biggest casinos
[20638.73s -> 20643.77s]  In new england, I couldn't have gambled there
[20648.31s -> 20649.67s]  You would know
[20649.67s -> 20652.71s]  Yeah, I would know because it was one of the biggest construction and
[20653.67s -> 20655.67s]  projects the state had ever seen
[20655.99s -> 20657.99s]  Wait, what do I live under a rock?
[20659.99s -> 20661.99s]  That was happening before I moved
[20668.82s -> 20680.78s]  Prove you're not addicted and don't play any gambling games for a year
[20684.89s -> 20686.97s]  Playing terraria is a gambling game
[20687.78s -> 20690.18s]  You kill monsters and hope they drop the thing that you want
[20692.01s -> 20694.25s]  Should I never play a loot based game ever again?
[20697.54s -> 20699.54s]  That's that's kind of gamble
[20699.86s -> 20702.26s]  You kill the same boss like 20 times to see if
[20703.72s -> 20707.08s]  You open the hearthstone packs to try to get the stuff in there to get the
[20709.70s -> 20711.70s]  This is the logic that ea used
[20727.75s -> 20736.39s]  Ea used the oh, yeah what he didn't use that logic. I'm good. I got it. It is loot box politics
[20752.14s -> 20754.14s]  It sadly is to an extent
[20759.61s -> 20761.88s]  tf2 is gambling
[20761.88s -> 20763.88s]  Hey easy now
[20763.88s -> 20768.58s]  Easy now
[20768.58s -> 20770.58s]  All right only a couple more we got
[20770.58s -> 20772.58s]  Nick just came in with 50 dollars
[20774.97s -> 20779.37s]  A few minutes ago. We were in the middle of talking about some things, but thank you nick for the
[20780.55s -> 20783.80s]  5,000 bits 50 bucks
[20783.80s -> 20785.80s]  That's a huge amount of money right at the very end
[20786.76s -> 20790.92s]  They said i'm quitting twitch. Just wanted to thank you from one of my favorite streamers of all time
[20793.77s -> 20795.53s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars
[20795.53s -> 20799.22s]  nick hopefully um
[20799.22s -> 20804.86s]  Quitting twitch the thing is
[20806.55s -> 20808.55s]  Let's say that if you know that that's for real
[20809.27s -> 20811.86s]  And sometimes you kind of have to unplug a little you know
[20815.61s -> 20817.67s]  Social media is great
[20817.67s -> 20819.27s]  Streaming stuff is great
[20819.27s -> 20824.49s]  I mean sometimes you gotta do something else, you know pull your brain out a little
[20832.52s -> 20835.48s]  I barely even I barely participate in social media
[20837.11s -> 20839.11s]  Look at my twitter. Look at my facebook
[20842.65s -> 20845.21s]  But regardless of your reasons nick. Thank you so much
[20846.09s -> 20848.44s]  um
[20848.44s -> 20851.32s]  Thank you with the 50 dollars
[20851.32s -> 20856.20s]  And uh, maybe uh, we'll see you again another time if not, then good luck with whatever uh, whatever you do
[20860.34s -> 20862.18s]  uh back in
[20862.18s -> 20864.84s]  Gave two dollars and fifty cents
[20864.84s -> 20869.32s]  I already posted this before on discord and on chat, but I made a germ a tier list tier list
[20870.84s -> 20873.59s]  Oh my god that you could do
[20874.23s -> 20876.34s]  Or not
[20876.34s -> 20878.34s]  Maybe at the very end. I would do one of these
[20878.98s -> 20880.86s]  Why would I?
[20880.86s -> 20882.86s]  Why would I do one of these?
[20885.19s -> 20887.19s]  Thank you for the 250 though
[20887.43s -> 20891.58s]  For audience thanks to the 250. I would uh not be against terraria saturdays
[20901.02s -> 20908.42s]  Neither would I
[20908.42s -> 20911.99s]  That's why i'm doing it
[20911.99s -> 20916.07s]  Yeah, just keep adding them. I'm gonna do like at least another four or five of those over the next like
[20916.47s -> 20932.98s]  Month and with that
