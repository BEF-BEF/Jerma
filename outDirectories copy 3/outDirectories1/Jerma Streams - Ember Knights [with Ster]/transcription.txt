[21.50s -> 49.74s]  Hey, what's up? How's it going? Early. That's right. Yeah. Hello. Are you there? Yeah.
[50.81s -> 60.30s]  Hey, everybody. You hear who that is? It's um. Who is it? What's your name? Like it starts
[60.30s -> 69.21s]  uh, Ster. Oh, it's Ster. Hey, how's it going? And I'm absolutely gonna not be weird anymore.
[69.21s -> 73.53s]  Why? I just figured like I've been being like too weird and I'm like, I'm done.
[74.98s -> 81.14s]  You're turning over a new leaf here. Yeah. Interesting. I sense that like a lot of the times
[82.02s -> 84.50s]  I make you uncomfortable and I'm just going to be super normal today.
[88.87s -> 92.15s]  All right. So what that actually means is that in like 25 minutes,
[93.03s -> 100.01s]  you're going to turn your webcam on and just be naked. What? Why? You're going to turn your
[100.01s -> 102.41s]  webcam on. You're going to be wearing like, I don't know what you're going to be doing.
[103.74s -> 110.92s]  Why can't, why can't you trust me for like one stream? I'm not going to be weird today.
[110.92s -> 117.00s]  Nothing strange is going to happen. Don't, I'm turning over a new leaf. My wife is the same
[117.00s -> 121.72s]  exact way. And I've talked about this before. Whenever I say I'm going to, can I borrow one
[121.72s -> 125.32s]  of your bras and I'm going to, I'm not going to do anything weird with it. She won't let me have it.
[129.96s -> 133.00s]  Well, but why does it have to be prefaced with something weird?
[133.80s -> 139.24s]  Well, it's not, it's, it's not going to be weird. I'm going to be totally normal. I'm going to be
[139.24s -> 143.24s]  incredibly professional and we're going to have a fantastic time playing Ember Nights,
[143.24s -> 147.64s]  my second Ember related game. Yeah. That's another thing we have to bring up. I'm,
[147.64s -> 152.20s]  I'm sorry. I have to apologize to everybody. This is the second Ember game that Stir has wanted us
[152.20s -> 160.79s]  to play. Um, I, am I stream dying? What's going on here? I hope not. It's just so not used to
[160.79s -> 167.82s]  being live that it's like rejecting it. Why does it say it's unstable? It's weird. Stir, please.
[170.66s -> 177.62s]  What? No, you're fine. Relax. All right. So what do you, can you explain what this game is before?
[177.62s -> 181.06s]  And wait before, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are we doing after?
[182.66s -> 189.70s]  We are 100% today doing the Five Nights at Freddy's watch along stream. Yes.
[190.42s -> 195.38s]  He's so excited. I've been waiting for this for like a month, by the way. I've got, I've got threats
[195.38s -> 201.30s]  in the mail from him since the last time we didn't do it. And he thinks I don't know it was him.
[202.55s -> 210.26s]  You promised us. I'll do it. All right. So you, those that don't know, this is Ember Nights.
[210.98s -> 214.50s]  It is a friend game, but you just, I actually don't even know what this is.
[215.38s -> 221.06s]  I just don't know. Um, I, I, I'm not entirely sure. It's generally like a co-op beat em up.
[221.46s -> 230.42s]  What was the old game that you co-op and you beat in a month? Uh, Battletoads? Yeah. Sure.
[231.22s -> 236.63s]  It's Battletoads. It's like Battletoads. It's a roguelike and I don't really know.
[238.15s -> 242.65s]  I've actually heard all jokes aside. I've heard good things. I, that's too. I've heard very good
[242.65s -> 246.33s]  things. I was playing, uh, I was having, you know, a little bit of a roguelike kick again. And I was
[246.33s -> 250.09s]  like, I never tried Ember Nights when it came out and it's got updates. So. Hey, did you tweet?
[251.35s -> 263.77s]  Uh, no, I didn't tweet. I didn't tweet. I usually just copy your tweet. I don't know a single
[263.77s -> 272.66s]  streamer that likes tweeting that they're live. Yeah. I don't know why I still do it. Why do I
[272.66s -> 280.14s]  still do that? Do you do that still? Do what? To tweet out every stream you do. Mine are forgettable.
[280.14s -> 286.55s]  So I don't need to let people know. I feel like I just, I have, that's a thing that has been a thing
[286.63s -> 293.70s]  since like 2012. And I just never stopped doing it. It's the only thing I put on my Twitter.
[293.70s -> 301.59s]  Well, better than nothing. You can set it up to be, have it be automatic. I could do that,
[301.59s -> 306.71s]  but I don't know. I feel like I have to be doing it. Then it has like a really lame, it's like a
[306.71s -> 316.26s]  lame generic default tweet. It doesn't have the extra flair. Why is my character named combo meal?
[316.98s -> 328.23s]  Because I, I felt like it today. All right. Are you, are you good to go? Uh, that depends. Are
[328.23s -> 334.42s]  you good to go? I mean, I am now, by the way, you're only getting face cam for 10 minutes today.
[334.42s -> 347.90s]  I've decided. Oh, why's that? Why? Because I, I had a, I had, look at big side burns and I was
[347.90s -> 353.98s]  going to do like a big side burn joke. Wait, why, why did you do it? I know. Cause I like, I,
[354.94s -> 363.40s]  I had to, I had to leave the house and I was like, I have, okay, if I leave the house,
[363.40s -> 368.52s]  then I'm going to look, I'm going to look fucking weird. Cause it was, I did it deliberately weird.
[369.48s -> 374.60s]  I think it was so, it was so bunched up right here. I'll have to do like the shave joke,
[376.95s -> 384.39s]  have something real weird, but not today. Today is very normal. No, just do wait. Hey, wait,
[384.39s -> 390.06s]  do you want to have the be as gross as possible challenge with me? Uh, what does that? I don't
[390.06s -> 396.49s]  think I need to explain very much more. Be as, as when, is this like a, like a date or is this
[396.49s -> 401.21s]  just now? No, this is just, it's just like, they just don't shave and don't cut your hair for like
[401.21s -> 408.81s]  a year. I, I don't, I'm trying to do the not shave again. My beard's getting pretty, pretty chunky,
[408.81s -> 414.25s]  but I've been trimming it so that it doesn't go in my mouth. I don't even know what would happen
[414.25s -> 424.20s]  to me. Just, and I'm not, when I talk about don't shave, I mean nothing. You don't do any cleanup.
[424.52s -> 430.94s]  You don't do any trims. It's just let it just go and don't do anything. You, you, you have to do
[430.94s -> 436.38s]  you a little bit. Well, for me, my mustache gets long enough that it curls into my mouth.
[437.26s -> 444.70s]  And if I didn't trim that, then it's like, I have, I'm eating my own hair all day. Yeah. I mean,
[444.70s -> 449.91s]  well, the, the one thing that we, the one thing that I would allow is that just trim it. So that
[449.91s -> 455.94s]  doesn't go in your mouth, but everything else has to stay. Okay. I mean, yeah, go for it. Have you
[455.94s -> 461.26s]  ever had a beard? No, I, the same thing happens every single time. I get to the point where I,
[461.26s -> 467.88s]  I get to that exact moment where just let it go for another month and see what it looks like.
[467.88s -> 473.78s]  And I go, no, this is fucked up looking. And I get rid of it. I never crossed that threshold.
[475.74s -> 480.87s]  I got a break for the awkward stage. That's right. And I never do you, you just, just a mustache,
[480.87s -> 485.91s]  I think would be great for you. My head doesn't feel like especially like a little, a little curly
[485.91s -> 491.51s]  mustache on the ends. It feels like that's your vibe. By the way, I took the is stir my type
[491.51s -> 502.76s]  test and the answer is no. Well, no one was my type. That was impossible. Can you air dash?
[503.94s -> 514.78s]  Yeah. Can you eat me whole? No. I put a freebie on there for you. I did. So you probably had more
[514.78s -> 527.30s]  than most. Yeah. It turns out, sorry. Not compatible. Sorry. I mean, if you got like 20%, I could make
[527.30s -> 534.79s]  some, um, will you press a for me, please? Are we playing? I'm waiting for you. Wait,
[534.79s -> 538.39s]  you never explained the grossest part was the grossest possible stream. Just
[539.38s -> 544.34s]  throw your beard out. You can't walk and chew gum at the same time. I don't even know anything
[544.34s -> 547.46s]  about the game. We're going to like, as soon as I click star game, if you're going to say quiet,
[547.46s -> 550.66s]  there's a cinematic. And then you're going to say like, wait, I don't know what these are.
[550.66s -> 554.74s]  Is no cinematic in this game is that that's not going to happen. We're going with this. It's like
[554.82s -> 560.90s]  a roguelike. All right. I just want one question answered. Yeah. Is the grossest possible stream
[561.46s -> 568.38s]  just you growing your beard? Yeah. It's just, it just don't. Yeah. How was that gross? Well,
[568.38s -> 571.82s]  that's not, I mean, I'm just saying like, just, I don't know. Maybe the word is disheveled.
[572.70s -> 579.80s]  What's the right word? So anyone who has a beard is like gross and to show. No, no, I'm saying if
[579.80s -> 584.36s]  you don't do any, don't like trim it, don't do any maintenance, don't, don't do any trimming,
[584.36s -> 590.92s]  just let it just go caveman style. There are plenty of people that that rock beards phenomenally
[590.92s -> 595.93s]  well. I'm talking no maintenance at all. I'm just talking, just let it go caveman style.
[595.93s -> 601.51s]  And I'm talking eyebrows too. And ear hair and the hair that grows in your fucking ear too. Wait,
[601.51s -> 611.91s]  you shave your eyebrows? No, I fuck. You don't, you don't do any maintenance here? No. Come on,
[612.39s -> 618.71s]  I was born this way. Okay. And you don't, you don't pull the gross old man hairs out of your ears?
[620.66s -> 625.38s]  Never. That's not a thing. That's not a thing. I said I wasn't going to be gross today and look
[625.38s -> 632.74s]  at you. You're just trying to fill the void. I've left. I do like that. It points to you.
[633.46s -> 643.54s]  How is it? How is, how is plucking your eyebrows just slightly? So I just, I don't like when hair
[643.54s -> 647.82s]  is in the middle. That's fine. If you don't want a unibrow, but when you're saying like,
[647.82s -> 656.12s]  I pluck my brows, that's a whole no, I'm talking about like here. Come on. And look what you got
[656.12s -> 662.47s]  to do a little bit of maintenance. I think you're ashamed of being a man. I've just told you I wanted
[662.47s -> 668.47s]  to grow all my hair out for like a year. So called it gross and disheveled grow your hair out.
[669.27s -> 674.87s]  You're missing the context. What is this sound effect that you're making right now with your
[674.87s -> 683.99s]  mouth? Am I? This is not you doing this. No, that's just like void waiting for all. We just
[683.99s -> 690.23s]  got to go. We don't have any. No. Enter the tears of the kingdom. Okay. And you skipped the opening
[690.23s -> 694.31s]  cut scene. You fucked up my joke. I didn't because we already saw it before the stream. It didn't
[694.31s -> 702.60s]  exist. What's going on right now? Why is this so weird? What? What is going on? What's happening
[702.60s -> 710.73s]  with this? I don't know. I'm certainly not me because I'm not doing anything weird. Did you,
[710.73s -> 721.64s]  did you do this? I don't even know what you're talking about. Are you ready? Oh, dude,
[721.64s -> 728.28s]  is money in this game? Are you serious? There's seriously money. Um, the dash. We both got the
[728.28s -> 733.70s]  money. We share it. That's good. Oh, yeah. You know, you know, dodge rolls. Yeah, you know,
[733.70s -> 742.18s]  dodge rolls. So do we have any context of what's happening right now? I don't think so. I think
[742.18s -> 745.70s]  the world's ending and we're the only ones who can save it because we're the Ember Knight. Hey,
[745.70s -> 755.40s]  hey, idiot, idiot. Are they high frames? I haven't played this. I'm in a weird mood. I'm sorry.
[758.12s -> 762.42s]  He hasn't streamed in a while and just comes back and is like, I'm going to go super great.
[762.42s -> 765.78s]  I'm going to do something insane that you guys have never seen, but I'm not going to shave.
[768.76s -> 771.80s]  But I mean, it was, it's different to everybody here.
[778.18s -> 783.62s]  Dude, I got, hey, I'm cooking up some wild shit. I'm telling you, I'm not going to shave for two
[783.62s -> 792.10s]  months. Yeah. The German contents got a weird direction. Wait, wait, wait. We have to decide
[792.10s -> 800.42s]  who do we share? I want shield. I want the charge. You didn't even you need. We need to roll for it.
[800.42s -> 805.22s]  Oh, I guess I'm going to be the fire guy. Well, your head looks like fire. You're a fireman.
[805.22s -> 814.57s]  That's kind of your thing. Oh, you have to hit enemies 10 times to get your thing. Okay. Okay.
[814.65s -> 819.72s]  So we just wasted them. That's not like a burp at first. And now it doesn't.
[820.28s -> 828.65s]  Now it does. Annoying. I joke is ruined. Are we going to, are we going to destroy?
[828.65s -> 833.13s]  I was thinking today because I heard that like Diablo four is like closer launch than I thought.
[833.13s -> 836.81s]  And I was like, I should ask Jerma if he wants to like do a co-op Diablo four and it comes out
[837.37s -> 842.57s]  and now he's going to destroy every single barrel. I'm just going to, he's going to read
[842.57s -> 847.53s]  every single item again and I'm going to fucking make the worst content I've ever made in my life.
[849.08s -> 857.45s]  Like it's probably not a good idea. You don't want to play Diablo four. Yeah. I mean, I, I don't,
[857.45s -> 866.68s]  I don't, I don't know what I'm going to do with these ones. I feel like D four is going to be a
[866.68s -> 875.06s]  game that I play just like on the couch. You're damn it. You're the reason they're making these
[875.06s -> 884.92s]  games so shit. No. What are you talking about? Couch Diablo sacrilege. Why? You're almost dead
[884.92s -> 895.21s]  by the way. I am room fine. Yeah. Hey, hey, worry about yourself. I have been and that's why I'm
[895.21s -> 908.42s]  not taking so much damage. All right. What did you just say? Don't just pick up stuff. I want to
[908.42s -> 912.82s]  see what it does. Okay. Read it. Whenever you use a skill, you throw a snowball at a random enemy
[912.82s -> 917.14s]  that damages and freezes them and does fight damage. And this one is, is your first skill
[917.62s -> 922.26s]  deals bonus damage. You don't have, what are you doing? What do you have for a skill right now?
[923.06s -> 932.73s]  Shield charge. Do you want the bonus damage? Yeah. Okay. So now I, I am both fire and ice.
[934.20s -> 939.11s]  You're an anime character. What, what the hell? What was the last sentence that you just said
[939.11s -> 946.17s]  before this? Oh, we just, uh, Diablo four. Oh, you, you talk about, no, no, no. You talk about
[946.17s -> 951.37s]  me playing on the couch. Oh, on the couch. Yeah. Couch. So if I'm connected to a PC
[951.37s -> 955.53s]  and I play Diablo four with a controller in my hand on the couch, I'm on PC by the way.
[956.92s -> 968.46s]  Does that make me a bad person? Yeah. Why? I just want the control scheme of the controller. I don't,
[968.46s -> 973.10s]  that's all I want. I'm not, I just want the controls. I just want the controller control scheme.
[973.10s -> 977.82s]  It's totally valid. And if you want to do that, that's fine. But you're the reason the game's bad.
[978.62s -> 983.74s]  No, no, I'm not. Like if people like you didn't exist, they would have made a much better game.
[984.62s -> 996.50s]  Oh, sorry. I, oh, it was, they were the same thing. Hey, if you, you want to compare ours
[996.50s -> 1003.86s]  and Diablo two, we can do that. You would win by a long shot. I was like, what, what,
[1005.06s -> 1014.79s]  this guy's crazy. I like playing Diablo with a controller. Well, one specific reason
[1016.10s -> 1021.06s]  because left clicking with my hand, my hand can start to hurt after a while. After a long gaming
[1021.06s -> 1024.42s]  session in Diablo, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
[1024.42s -> 1031.50s]  click, click, click. It hurts. I feel that I only want it to be able to press X. That's it. I
[1032.06s -> 1036.70s]  give me the PC. Well, no, no, like I, I, I understand because Victor Fran was like a
[1036.70s -> 1041.58s]  controller action RPG and it's a very good game. So you know what? I'm going to stop being such an
[1041.58s -> 1048.38s]  elitist and I'm going to let you have the W you could sit on your couch and you can play Diablo
[1048.38s -> 1054.30s]  four. Why not? There's no choices being made. There's nothing you need to do. Why shouldn't
[1054.30s -> 1060.31s]  you be able to play it with a controller? It's annoying that I'm going to die before you right
[1060.31s -> 1065.67s]  now. Cause like what you're saying is like, like I have two health and you have 23. And if I die
[1065.67s -> 1070.23s]  first, then everything you're saying is valid. You're playing with a controller right now.
[1071.19s -> 1083.08s]  How are you? Yeah. Yeah. I'm on, I'm on mouse and keyboard. So
[1084.36s -> 1090.12s]  hold on. Point stand. Nope. Hold on a second. I'm going to, I'm defending this to the death.
[1090.68s -> 1098.28s]  Okay. In the menu of the game on the bottom left, it says controller is recommended for the best
[1098.28s -> 1104.04s]  experience. It literally says that I win. Where does it say that? In the menu, right at the bottom
[1104.04s -> 1112.86s]  of the menu. Well, you got me there. You and stir should box. I would drop them. There's no way.
[1113.98s -> 1117.18s]  That's another thing. Like, you know, I was thinking of asking you to play Diablo four and
[1117.18s -> 1122.70s]  I know it would be a bad time and you know, we should definitely box, but like sometimes in my
[1122.70s -> 1126.62s]  chat, people like me and you should play guilty gear together. And I'm like, what's the fun in me
[1126.62s -> 1134.28s]  just like destroying you? Like, like it's funny for like 30 seconds and then we need to do something
[1134.28s -> 1139.32s]  else. Street Fighter, the same thing with boxing. Street Fighter six is, seems like it's going to be
[1139.32s -> 1145.93s]  awesome by the way. Does it? It does. Do you, what do you, how much do you know about Street Fighter
[1145.93s -> 1151.29s]  six? I played the demo. I did the tutorial and the demo and I've been, I know that I want to play
[1151.29s -> 1156.81s]  Maria. She's the big giant Dami mommy. And that's like the one thing that has me like still thinking
[1156.81s -> 1160.65s]  that I might play the game. I don't really play fighting games with the one thing that's pulling
[1160.65s -> 1170.31s]  me there is the go and fight random pedestrians on the street. Oh, oh, oh yeah. That was a character
[1170.31s -> 1176.63s]  creator and you can make some really weird weirdos for sure. There's a part of that tutorial. I got
[1176.63s -> 1181.59s]  the demo. I tried it. There's a part of that game that's just like, oh yeah, by the way, um, welcome
[1181.59s -> 1186.79s]  to the open world. Everybody around you, you can just challenge them to a fight. And it's even like,
[1186.79s -> 1190.07s]  there's just people like on their cell phone, just talking and you can go up and challenge them.
[1190.71s -> 1196.87s]  And you just, was that a demo? Yeah. You just fight like a regular person. I missed all that.
[1196.87s -> 1200.95s]  You missed it. Okay. Well, you got to check that out. I've seen it in the trailers, but you know,
[1200.95s -> 1205.99s]  I missed it. I only did like the demo and then there was only Ryu and Ken. And then I was like,
[1205.99s -> 1211.24s]  okay, where's my Dami mommy? And I closed it. I'm going to go to poison.
[1216.50s -> 1220.90s]  You got one health, dude. I know what we've been talking and shit. There's an inventory.
[1221.54s -> 1230.02s]  I think we have to equip stuff. Or maybe not. I think it being in those slots is what there's
[1230.02s -> 1242.52s]  like a slot limit. Okay. I assume. Okay. Be careful in this next room there, bud. Oh, I see.
[1242.52s -> 1250.87s]  Okay. Holding it. Watch out there, buddy. I didn't get hit. Watch out, pal. Watch your own screen.
[1255.70s -> 1267.43s]  Boss next room, pal. Okay, pal. All right there. This is a mini boss. Looks pretty big to me.
[1268.31s -> 1272.47s]  All right. You fight it. I'll be I'll be over here with a mushroom.
[1273.19s -> 1300.04s]  Snake. That was chicken. Fuck. What's he doing? What's he doing? You have the chicken. We both
[1300.04s -> 1312.71s]  have 11 health. What? I was behind him. He hit me. He cheated. He dashed forward and hit me behind
[1312.71s -> 1320.70s]  him. Cheated. That was fun. The game feels pretty fluid. Yeah, it's pretty crunchy. Pretty cream
[1320.70s -> 1336.47s]  cheesy. I can I can understand that. Finally. Help. Get these loiterers out of here. Wait. Oh,
[1336.47s -> 1353.05s]  God. He's got bugs. What was the thing? I forget. What was the thing? Diablo 4. Diablo 4? You are
[1353.69s -> 1361.00s]  and I'm trying to be nice about this but you probably are the biggest ARPG elitist I've ever
[1361.00s -> 1367.56s]  met in my whole life. And I mean by a long shot by an unbelievable amount. Thank you.
[1368.12s -> 1380.46s]  I appreciate it. How do you actually feel about D4? I feel like. I mean absolutely no disrespect
[1380.46s -> 1386.30s]  by the way. I mean you're very. That is the compliment. I've put a lot of time in being such
[1388.07s -> 1394.07s]  a guy. I feel like it's it's way too simple. There's no choices to making character creation
[1394.63s -> 1397.75s]  and it's going to get real boring real fast when you get to end game and you're just finding
[1398.31s -> 1403.30s]  I oh my unique sword. Oh now I have to find the legendary sword of that exact same sword. Oh now
[1403.30s -> 1407.46s]  I have to find the ancient sword like it's just I feel like it's just going to be the same thing
[1407.46s -> 1420.92s]  over and over again with no actual choices. Okay and I am going to wait until the end game
[1420.92s -> 1431.22s]  is available. I'm going to hold my opinion until then. Well once you have to farm the third variant
[1431.22s -> 1440.82s]  of unique status of your same weapon then you let me know and then and then finally play POE so you
[1440.82s -> 1445.06s]  have something to actually compare it to or Torchlight Infinite. What was the whole rant
[1445.06s -> 1449.22s]  that you went on that you said that like Titanfall hypnotized everybody to pretend that it was a good
[1449.22s -> 1453.78s]  game or something? Titanfall? Didn't you say like Titanfall? Well back when Titanfall came out you
[1453.78s -> 1457.94s]  were like everybody thought it was great and you were like I don't like it and it's not good.
[1457.94s -> 1463.38s]  You said it was like you said it was like I don't think it was Titanfall. You said that Titanfall
[1463.38s -> 1469.35s]  was like an illusion game or something whatever it was. I've definitely said this this was not
[1469.35s -> 1473.19s]  my chat saying they think it was Valorant. I think Titanfall 2 is one of the best
[1473.19s -> 1479.27s]  games like FPS games ever so I doubt I said that. I'm probably thinking of a different game.
[1479.27s -> 1483.43s]  Titanfall was good. I thought Titanfall was good. I've said that about vampire survivors for sure.
[1483.43s -> 1494.70s]  That's maybe what it was so now I'm like this um like what why Titanfall? I don't know where you
[1494.70s -> 1499.18s]  pulled Titanfall out of here. Where did Titanfall come from? It hypnotized yeah it was we're talking
[1499.18s -> 1504.54s]  about vampire survivors it hypnotized everyone there's no no I've also just said this about
[1504.54s -> 1509.42s]  Loop Hero. Absolutely nothing happens in Loop Hero. I swear I'm telling you you said this before.
[1510.14s -> 1516.12s]  Well Loop Hero was a long time ago and I probably said that about that as well. Let me see what I
[1516.12s -> 1525.35s]  just got. So this stuff is level one Loop Hero. I've never played it. You would fucking love Loop
[1525.35s -> 1535.69s]  Hero dude. Would I? If I'm saying it's a game that makes you think it's a game you will love it.
[1535.69s -> 1541.37s]  Can't you just like enjoy shit and can't you just like have fun? I enjoy a lot of shit very
[1541.37s -> 1544.57s]  passionately that's why I'm saying that there's other things better that you can be spending
[1544.57s -> 1551.11s]  your time on other than like vampire survivors. I will not let you sit here and talk about that
[1551.75s -> 1555.43s]  Do you want to play a good game? Do you want to like try a cool game I recommend? Oh like oh Jade
[1555.43s -> 1561.51s]  Cocoon? Want to play POE? Yeah dude Jade Cocoon. Jade Cocoon is one of the rarest video games of
[1561.51s -> 1568.87s]  all time. Is it? You can't find it anywhere. Did you actually look? Yeah dude I looked everywhere.
[1571.45s -> 1576.10s]  That's a shame because everyone's holding on to it because it's such a such a little gem.
[1576.90s -> 1580.23s]  It's a good series.
[1588.07s -> 1594.20s]  I know I know what that reference is. Oh you mean little gem. I thought you meant Jade Cocoon.
[1596.36s -> 1601.80s]  Jade Cocoon 2 was the game that was available and I remember I asked you I said hey dude I can't
[1601.80s -> 1609.96s]  find Jade Cocoon 1. Is Jade Cocoon 2 okay? I believe it was like $400 and you were like
[1609.96s -> 1614.84s]  no dude and that's the wrong one. Yeah I heard I never played it but I heard Jade Cocoon 2 was
[1614.84s -> 1620.30s]  terrible. Can somebody confirm that with me? I it's they're expensive and they're rare.
[1621.18s -> 1627.48s]  All right do you want a gem of wisdom or do you want something else? Uh or or gem gem a
[1627.48s -> 1636.01s]  path let's power up. Wait wait wait hold on. I don't know what this is. Two is better? It's
[1636.01s -> 1645.43s]  $60 on eBay. Two is good. I guess I was it's like 50 bucks. How much is Jade Cocoon 1? Did I just
[1645.43s -> 1671.46s]  make that number up? Nope I didn't. It's a hundred bucks. $75. Okay I start at what point is how much
[1671.46s -> 1676.90s]  percentage over something that's expensive isn't over complete overreaction? Like what percentage
[1676.90s -> 1684.26s]  wise? Like if I said dude it's like 500 bucks and if it was like 200 bucks is that still okay?
[1685.90s -> 1693.90s]  Uh I believe I think that's pretty bad because because you're saying dude it's fine you're saying
[1693.98s -> 1698.46s]  it very confidently and very assertively and very aggressively so it needs to be more accurate the
[1698.46s -> 1703.10s]  more you're like if you're like I think it's like 500 and if it was 200 that'd be okay that's true
[1703.10s -> 1707.34s]  but you you sound like you know what you're talking about you really have no idea yeah that's right
[1707.34s -> 1716.58s]  that's you're right that's bad that's bad that's that's bad dude if I had been like um I I think
[1716.58s -> 1722.58s]  that game is like expensive I don't know I'm not sure but I got angry with you and told you it was
[1722.58s -> 1729.27s]  $400 it's not even correct I got angry and just like guessed higher
[1732.10s -> 1734.66s]  all right do you get to pick a skill here too are we both picking one?
[1738.38s -> 1754.34s]  I think we both pick it's the second yeah yeah okay I pick and then you pick I like that
[1758.07s -> 1761.99s]  well you're literally a little bit of a magician okay let's get the hearts the healing let's get
[1761.99s -> 1767.19s]  the healing fountain I think how do we what is it the middle mouse okay you're on controller
[1767.83s -> 1776.94s]  I don't know what my the recommended way by the way yeah I know so you can dash over there healing
[1776.94s -> 1789.61s]  spring oh oh you're you're taking it all oh whoops okay sorry all right I did not think it was
[1789.61s -> 1794.73s]  gonna do that I we've shared everything in the game so far I figured we both could share
[1794.73s -> 1800.97s]  that together we've both been getting the same drops and that is true no the the shop we can
[1800.97s -> 1819.08s]  only buy like the same core items frozen frozen oh you froze him so let me practice this because
[1819.08s -> 1826.44s]  are you doing perfect uh I don't know what that is okay so when you hold down your ability it's
[1826.44s -> 1830.52s]  gonna fill up that bar you have to wait till it gets completely full and you have to time it
[1830.52s -> 1835.88s]  correctly to let go at the perfect time and then it does more stuff just to let you know well if
[1835.88s -> 1843.30s]  you're like practicing it you're still consuming uses and yeah you'll you'll get it you're much
[1843.30s -> 1855.64s]  more than I am I feel like I had a lot to talk about today like I feel like there was a lot of
[1855.64s -> 1861.35s]  things where I was you know what I want to get his opinion on this like what I don't know you've
[1861.35s -> 1866.95s]  asked me like one question it'll come I have a question yeah um as a reminder not being weird
[1866.95s -> 1873.03s]  today what is your like deepest fantasy and as a fantasy I'm defining as something that
[1873.03s -> 1879.91s]  you know will never happen riding on okay I got it riding on a roller coaster alone alone yeah
[1879.91s -> 1883.51s]  like having a theme park completed by being able to go to like disney world completely alone with
[1883.51s -> 1889.91s]  like the five people I feel like that could happen if you really wanted to have I don't think so
[1890.87s -> 1903.93s]  okay mine is a notebook where I've taken notes in it for a long time and every single page is
[1903.93s -> 1908.89s]  perfectly filled up with the exact like cool thing I wanted to write in it and there's like
[1908.89s -> 1913.05s]  drawings to go along with it like if you look through the notebook when you go along like it's
[1913.05s -> 1919.53s]  it's like a macula perfect handwriting it's like a joy to look at how is that not achievable
[1919.69s -> 1927.37s]  that's simply not it's how could how how could you do that so fire somebody because no every
[1927.37s -> 1932.81s]  time you like go to write a page of notes you start then like you realize like I don't need to
[1932.81s -> 1937.21s]  like I don't need to take notes on this anymore like it's not as in depth as I thought like I'm
[1937.21s -> 1941.21s]  over like you know and then like every page doesn't line up with the page before it like
[1941.21s -> 1947.34s]  you're trying to get like a chronological set of notes you know I'm saying I mean you you could
[1947.66s -> 1951.42s]  compile a bunch of stuff and if somebody helped you put it together and clean it up
[1951.42s -> 1957.30s]  that's just a whole career about people doing that it's like literally like proofreading
[1958.02s -> 1977.18s]  copy reading all kinds of stuff like that watch out final phase oh he shut down
[1977.90s -> 1987.26s]  you were supposed to keep dpsing I didn't die because if you just hit him if you just hit up
[1987.26s -> 2000.89s]  with me I'm fine I didn't die back up you could also rent out an amusement park all right I have
[2000.89s -> 2009.64s]  a feeling that renting out Disney World for a week is probably going to cost you millions of
[2009.64s -> 2015.48s]  dollars yeah it doesn't need to be Disney World yeah I'm just saying like I've I okay well then
[2016.04s -> 2020.36s]  what's an amusement park there's a there's a um there's a water park near where I live
[2020.36s -> 2026.52s]  and they sell like the exclusive pass like skip the line I was there nobody buys it there was a
[2026.52s -> 2033.08s]  line of like 60 people for like a water slide nobody in the premium one and it's like it's
[2033.08s -> 2040.34s]  like ten dollars more expensive oh it was crazy craziest thing I've ever seen in my life so it's
[2040.34s -> 2044.50s]  basically like you're there alone like you just walk you get you get the satisfaction of walking
[2044.50s -> 2055.50s]  past 60 people and just doing it as well did I buy it no I was in line give it to me please
[2055.50s -> 2063.08s]  but if I ever go again give it to me please hey that's because you lived on the bus because
[2063.08s -> 2071.16s]  you didn't know the rules I dodged the most enemy attacks too by the way I also dealt all the damage
[2071.16s -> 2086.20s]  what else did I do oh you ate all the food wow good for you I killed more enemies yeah it's called
[2086.20s -> 2092.66s]  last hitting okay I'm stepping it up oh yeah do you really want to make this like a whole
[2092.66s -> 2101.21s]  like a whole thing oh one of my biggest fantasies just came true right there I beat stir in a video
[2101.21s -> 2113.83s]  game no we both had two stars oh shit now I know that like I have to actually care now because like
[2113.83s -> 2133.13s]  I don't want you to get any wings shit yeah yeah you're playing now too hmm armor is always good
[2133.13s -> 2150.57s]  yeah I'm going armor yeah I'm going with this more skill damage so I do one and then the other
[2150.57s -> 2161.80s]  back to back apparently we got a buff in the horn I hate these sound effects it's like dial up
[2161.80s -> 2175.98s]  yeah I feel like oh so Esper actually summoned you I would have expected him to perish from
[2175.98s -> 2183.02s]  old age before actually making a move cringe this is the first time I've seen an ember knight
[2183.02s -> 2188.30s]  the defenders of the nexus thanks for telling me what I am is that supposed to be a joke a sneeze
[2188.30s -> 2194.78s]  could blow you away oh fuck it's hardly worth the effort but I'll give you something to play with
[2195.58s -> 2206.42s]  cringe and no you know you go ahead oh you do it this is the only minuscule portion of my power
[2206.42s -> 2222.74s]  try not to break too quickly yeah I could do it too yeah you can pretty good oh fuck I died
[2223.06s -> 2237.05s]  I was being a fucking idiot and just I don't know I had fun it doesn't matter oh defeat mini
[2237.05s -> 2251.03s]  boss to revive you that wasn't the mini boss okay well I hope you like watching what I was

[2277.59s -> 2292.57s]  this is a rogue like be careful I'm aware I'm aware you don't want to die on the right side
[2293.29s -> 2302.23s]  right side okay where do I go now uh yeah use uh your one more you're using it not that often
[2302.23s -> 2309.16s]  I'm using I'm using it pretty often uh there was a like doors up here up here using my one
[2320.81s -> 2326.81s]  oh what those things icicles randomly explode yeah the icicles hurt if you touch them the icicles hurt
[2326.81s -> 2330.09s]  you can't dodge through them and the doors over on the left side by the way so you're kind of
[2330.09s -> 2337.88s]  fighting in a weird spot okay good advice it's fine because all the healing items are for me now
[2339.40s -> 2342.20s]  left side right yep there you go there's more than one door
[2353.96s -> 2356.68s]  anybody that comes to stream right now don't even doesn't even know you're here

[2449.21s -> 2454.76s]  motivation to do it again tomorrow just took all the motivation from me I was gonna be a surprise
[2454.76s -> 2464.50s]  to my community um I apologize maybe you'll play a cool game instead I need to have some room in
[2464.50s -> 2474.89s]  between now I think it'd be a lot easier with like another guy yeah it would be you got this
[2474.89s -> 2485.62s]  though you're doing fine there's no dk barrel that you can just pick up and throw and I can jump out
[2485.62s -> 2497.32s]  of it wait I these are locked I have to actually swap something out now wait why is it showing me
[2497.32s -> 2502.20s]  it's showing me stat upgrade for me but it's making me choose from your combo meal body
[2504.34s -> 2510.10s]  I'm confused uh I don't know when I get revived can we do the thing that we that they do in donkey
[2510.42s -> 2528.18s]  country where I go you can you can do whatever you want but personally I love monkeys those
[2528.18s -> 2541.85s]  people that get it you get it those people that don't sorry I don't like these enemies so true I
[2541.85s -> 2587.30s]  agree yeah so true bestie mini boss time you better kill it uh I got no health just chill
[2595.53s -> 2599.29s]  yeah that's like two guys to like help help on the left help on the left
[2599.93s -> 2628.54s]  oh like hey you handle the ads I'll do the boss yeah I got eyes on you're doing fine you got
[2629.42s -> 2663.13s]  I got this nice get up karma nice stand up let's go for it oh spawns are the same health as me nice
[2666.84s -> 2673.61s]  let's go for it now let's like go in the shop and like over gear you you know what I mean do you need
[2673.61s -> 2682.70s]  this I don't think I can use it what do you need this I don't think I can use it hello is that
[2682.70s -> 2691.56s]  even coming through to you no oh never mind what was it I was recording oh all right so here
[2691.56s -> 2704.58s]  hundred and you got a lot more money than I do oh I'll take it I'll take that can you buy something
[2704.58s -> 2712.10s]  for me um I just spent a lot of money I don't have money for these now okay I I unfortunately
[2712.10s -> 2737.24s]  used it on myself watch out these enemies are tough watch out dude dude great work if I come
[2737.24s -> 2743.40s]  back and beat you how could that possibly happen anything is possible I killed the whole mini
[2743.40s -> 2768.14s]  boss by myself you know what I believe in you if anyone can do it it's you I think we're actually
[2768.14s -> 2773.88s]  doing really well I mean this is our first run ever yeah we're at the end of stage two soon
[2773.88s -> 2782.31s]  let's take a step you don't want the healing fountain hmm I mean you yeah let's do that
[2782.95s -> 2788.15s]  you could use it I feel like we probably should have taken the gem because the boss rooms seem
[2788.15s -> 2795.13s]  to also always heal you beforehand I think we can go to full yeah we should have taken the gem
[2795.13s -> 2820.41s]  is there like a a greater of application um I don't know perfect I don't think so all right
[2821.21s -> 2828.89s]  can we just take a quick second to see what do the stats do uh agility is was 10 move speed
[2828.89s -> 2845.48s]  precision is crit chance or something okay so crit chance they're spoiled it so we didn't get
[2845.48s -> 2856.76s]  the announcement oh wait people together people think that was real um what was the announcement
[2856.76s -> 2866.94s]  I didn't hear it that I'm gonna play sorcery oh you've already beat like all of them like six
[2866.94s -> 2875.02s]  times have you ever played sorcery yeah you did right yeah beat the first one you didn't
[2875.02s -> 2879.82s]  do this I I might have done like half of the second one I can't remember second one's the
[2879.82s -> 2889.08s]  best one I feel like stirred now would appreciate that game a lot more what do you think maybe I
[2889.08s -> 2899.10s]  mean I liked it when I played it I honestly can't remember why I stopped not that stir
[2900.06s -> 2906.20s]  back years ago wouldn't know but you like that game is right up your alley in your current
[2906.92s -> 2922.10s]  my current form the current form maybe yeah maybe I try it yeah maybe we play peewee together
[2922.74s -> 2932.17s]  or not together you yeah but you whatever yeah whatever why is so loud very loud maybe you spend
[2932.17s -> 2938.73s]  the five hundred dollars for gate cocoon what is this what's going on we got yeah see it always
[2938.73s -> 2949.59s]  heals and now we like we have like full health already we shouldn't have done it shit are you
[2949.59s -> 2961.75s]  ready person to get hit loses first person to get hit loses okay I knew you were going to just go
[2961.75s -> 2968.95s]  walk and stand in the corner you can play at that game and my character can actually go invisible
[2969.59s -> 2996.28s]  I'm pretty ranged what I'm invisible yes yeah you need like a cheap way to win right now
[2996.28s -> 3036.92s]  because you were dead for the whole stage what watch out for his ice attack watch out for his
[3036.92s -> 3058.22s]  ice watch out he's invincible but let's watch out for the sword dude you just froze the ice king
[3059.96s -> 3082.65s]  that's insane that's true yeah tps time if you're gonna beat me it's now guys I want to see these
[3082.65s -> 3095.42s]  oh shit what shit yourself right I got liquid all of me so you want this
[3096.98s -> 3101.62s]  it's like every time I take a sip out of my drink it's oh it's like way over here
[3101.62s -> 3104.74s]  because I hate it when it's in the way of my other monitor so I have to like
[3105.54s -> 3110.58s]  crouch creep over here drink out of my drink I turned into like a goblin when I go take a sip
[3110.58s -> 3114.97s]  all right what do you want do you want this um you should probably take it
[3115.61s -> 3122.74s]  it's weird that the bosses only give one power up and everything else
[3122.74s -> 3131.53s]  like duplicates it for us you look like luigi luigi's fucking cool luigi is the cooler brother
[3136.84s -> 3158.44s]  okay like being luigi's not cool new outfit wow mario is categorically better who's it gonna be
[3158.44s -> 3168.26s]  oh I hope it's me okay receive the most damage oh god hit too many times looks like
[3168.98s -> 3183.72s]  is it pretty good yeah I was dead the whole entire level that that's pretty good for coming back in
[3183.72s -> 3188.28s]  the first dying in the first room and then coming back in the last room you got the spectator
[3188.28s -> 3193.64s]  badge I've never got that before that's crazy all right this one's now the real one our our
[3193.64s -> 3208.65s]  damage taken is actually one damage apart yeah that's weird yeah that must be a bug this level
[3208.65s -> 3216.60s]  looks cool I think uh when when early access came out this was the end of the game this stage
[3216.60s -> 3221.88s]  so I don't I I'm like vaguely remember seeing someone play it how long has this been in early
[3221.88s -> 3231.13s]  access for I think it's been a year not 100 sure it's pretty it's pretty good an early access game
[3231.13s -> 3241.69s]  that was in early access for like a year good yeah yeah yeah it's pretty good that's pretty good
[3242.65s -> 3253.78s]  it seems like a pretty good turn around what's wrong I got hit yeah we also oh this is me uh
[3254.58s -> 3263.62s]  poisons them aren't you poisoning people uh I am so I should probably take it already I
[3263.62s -> 3274.97s]  apparently you like level one to level two I already have that I like that I also have fire
[3275.61s -> 3284.70s]  I have to replace something though don't I um I don't know I don't know if you get the second
[3284.70s -> 3307.00s]  row you do okay wow we are the ember knights dude you know what game is coming out that I

[3325.74s -> 3332.62s]  as golem yeah you just play you play as golem it's a third person action stealth game I don't know
[3332.62s -> 3343.78s]  who is it made by I fucking died and because I'm talking dude I'm just talking I can't man so

[3351.72s -> 3359.61s]  keep talking now tell me about this game it's a game where you play as golem and it looks kind of
[3360.17s -> 3362.97s]  fucked up it just doesn't yeah I don't know I don't know what to think about it
[3364.41s -> 3370.73s]  I don't even know who made it I just know that it exists and it's just he's crawling around he's
[3370.73s -> 3382.31s]  just like crawling around like this wait wait who is it made by I don't know that's not a real game
[3382.31s -> 3388.55s]  yeah it is it's I'm telling you it's a real game stop talking out your ass no the whole
[3388.55s -> 3397.59s]  trailer for the golem game is a bunch of close-ups of his face going like this like and then it shows
[3397.59s -> 3407.82s]  him like crawling over shit I'm gonna have a lot of fun with that game just you wait yeah every 10
[3407.82s -> 3417.21s]  to 20 seconds in that trailer it goes like this just zooms in on his face I almost got hit like
[3417.29s -> 3420.89s]  trying to look at your stream which I don't even have open to see what the face was
[3430.02s -> 3434.78s]  you're gonna scream at the day it comes out uh well I don't know about that we'll see
[3435.50s -> 3445.96s]  am I gonna be the only no there's no way I'm not the only day one golem lord of the rings scream
[3445.96s -> 3450.12s]  that's not gonna happen that's how many people are gonna play this why wouldn't they it's like a big
[3450.12s -> 3455.88s]  franchise I'm gonna die out here champ well it's a rogue like I don't think we're supposed to beat
[3455.88s -> 3467.16s]  it on the first try yes you are oh right stir is stir is gonna be very upset if we can't stir
[3467.16s -> 3473.34s]  hates progress stir hates resetting and progressing he hates it what are you talking about stir does
[3473.34s -> 3479.82s]  not like when a game forces you to have to start over and progress distinctly I don't like when you
[3479.82s -> 3488.28s]  die and then it gives you 700 bonus damage and then three extra lives this is different I like
[3488.28s -> 3503.91s]  restarting my identity is restarting do I want any of these do a golem cosplay just like like
[3503.91s -> 3508.47s]  grease in my hair and have it come down like this and just like I don't know make myself look old
[3509.11s -> 3539.21s]  hey exactly why I should never have shaved I have no shirt on just eat a raw fish isn't it funny
[3539.21s -> 3543.53s]  that when you know you only have less than 10 health that's when you actually care more than
[3543.53s -> 3549.05s]  anything yeah I don't know how my armor works the 14 armor I have is that just damage reduction
[3549.05s -> 3556.52s]  I was hoping that would be like extra life shop game is saved volume impression the whole time
[3557.62s -> 3565.02s]  no healing whenever you crit heal games over wait what is it whenever I crit I heal
[3565.58s -> 3570.23s]  hmm
[3577.40s -> 3583.29s]  could you just talk like that forever good you just like I don't want drama anymore I want to play
[3583.29s -> 3595.19s]  with golem that was cow from cow and chicken I guess they're one in the same I never never
[3595.19s -> 3615.98s]  thought about it chicken it's me cow it kind of is a little if I really tried I I might be able
[3615.98s -> 3623.08s]  to do it although that that that's Charlie Adler the voice actor one of the most talented human
[3623.08s -> 3633.80s]  beings to ever live did almost every voice on that show if you didn't know I didn't know
[3644.73s -> 3650.25s]  I gained 19 health that room from hitting things I don't think people understand just how much
[3650.25s -> 3660.14s]  influence red guy had on my entire life who's red guy cow and chicken I hated that show so
[3660.70s -> 3666.90s]  I kind of remember him I'm sorry I know like you're telling us about your like formative
[3666.90s -> 3672.02s]  childhood years and like what meant the most to you and I didn't like it and I know that I
[3672.02s -> 3678.25s]  don't like it doesn't like something else but like cow and chicken you don't like anything I
[3678.25s -> 3686.02s]  yeah I didn't like your top cartoons growing up top like give me like a top three I that that's
[3686.02s -> 3699.50s]  like I don't even know if I could do that pop oh okay I think oh god I did a I did a like uh
[3699.50s -> 3705.51s]  cartoon network top shows like quiz thing on stream a while ago so I'm like prepped for this
[3705.51s -> 3711.42s]  okay but it was specifically Cartoon Network though what good shows did Nickelodeon even have
[3711.42s -> 3719.37s]  oh stop what are you talking about Doug you didn't like Doug how does that hit me this game sucks
[3719.37s -> 3726.07s]  fuck that behind him yeah you were saying Doug I didn't like Doug you didn't like Doug
[3726.71s -> 3735.64s]  what about Rugrats Doug Rugrats Ren and Stimpy um this is not a cartoon but salute your shorts
[3735.64s -> 3744.65s]  that show was come on Spongebob you don't like Spongebob Spongebob's okay hey Arnold
[3744.65s -> 3751.37s]  Ren and Stimpy was good Ren and Stimpy should not have been on tv Rocco's modern life did you like
[3751.37s -> 3758.49s]  I didn't like that either I didn't like rock rock I can't believe it I don't know Cartoon Network
[3758.49s -> 3763.77s]  was just better okay top three we got to compare top three is not like what I don't like you're
[3763.77s -> 3766.41s]  going to get because if I do a top three that's the things that I did like then people will be
[3766.97s -> 3771.77s]  bass-pilled and true fact it and if I tell you all the things I don't like then I'm a loser
[3771.77s -> 3794.81s]  shit okay favorite cartoon grown up like open your stream and see what like how deep in thought you
[3794.81s -> 3803.51s]  are that's got to be the Looney Tunes has to be that makes a lot of sense has to be Looney Tunes
[3803.51s -> 3809.80s]  I and that's not even Cart that's completely disconnected I honestly the old Looney Tunes
[3809.80s -> 3815.40s]  routines are some of the most engaging some of the most fun the Roadrunner I think that Wiley
[3815.40s -> 3827.67s]  Coyote and Roadrunner is probably some of my favorite media ever uh Tom and Jerry was I liked
[3827.67s -> 3834.94s]  it but I liked Daffy and Bugs's bullshit that they would do back and forth so your top three
[3834.94s -> 3840.97s]  is Looney Tunes well I just gave you one it's honestly probably Rugrats I loved Rugrats it was
[3840.97s -> 3847.77s]  just such a well Rugrat well I wouldn't put it in top three Rugrat I loved Rug how could you not
[3847.77s -> 3855.77s]  like Rugrats yeah it was a great show top three especially because I'm I'm Ren and Stimpy has to
[3855.77s -> 3861.61s]  be up there too I it has to be Ashley tells me all the time about how Rugrats is the ugliest show
[3861.61s -> 3867.14s]  ever made and her as an artist I hear about it a lot she's not wrong a lot of the old fucking
[3867.14s -> 3874.60s]  disgusting hey you're talking about the the class geek super style come on I like the one episode
[3874.60s -> 3881.91s]  where is it stews having or one of the kids is like having like a fever dream how's about it uh
[3881.91s -> 3889.06s]  class geek super were it was a they had a studio it was a I think it was I'm trying to remember
[3889.06s -> 3897.19s]  correctly you're a dude oh it was it was two names it was certain style that was in it was um
[3897.75s -> 3907.59s]  did class gate super do uh what the hell what the hell what the hell rocket power was class
[3907.59s -> 3915.96s]  geek super they're they're just as ugly stop it I imagine so they did um wild wild thornberries
[3915.96s -> 3925.30s]  was osco well uh was class key super right did you like the wild thornberries no I think like
[3925.30s -> 3930.34s]  Nigel is funny for like a little bit to just hear him talk and that was about it
[3930.34s -> 3941.22s]  okay well all right it's probably all the old looney tunes combined with the x-men cartoon
[3941.22s -> 3949.37s]  I would say that's probably number two or three the old x-men cartoon I know it's still the one
[3949.37s -> 3961.62s]  where Wolverine's looking at the picture in bed is that the one thing that you have from this whole
[3961.70s -> 3967.96s]  entire series because that's that's the one meme it's the meme all right I remember like one other
[3967.96s -> 3972.92s]  episode that got dubbed over with juggernaut that's it the Batman animated series was up there as
[3972.92s -> 3982.26s]  well probably three spongebob first three or four seasons of spongebob first five seasons of spongebob
[3982.26s -> 3993.21s]  get out of here get out of town uh if you want to go even further than that we got some of the
[3993.21s -> 3999.98s]  adult swims up uh aquatine aquatine hunger force that's the first smart thing you've said all day
[3999.98s -> 4014.79s]  oh please aquatine was was awesome venture brothers was good yeah but that's not I they're
[4014.79s -> 4018.92s]  they're not part of this you know what I mean like they're animes that's what that's like if I ask
[4018.92s -> 4027.56s]  I ask you what your favorite cartoon is and you say um like one punch man how is that unfair
[4027.56s -> 4031.59s]  all right what are we are we going back to the main I feel like I feel like we're staying in
[4031.59s -> 4039.38s]  the category of like daytime tv cartoon well but you have and then when you bring in like oh my
[4039.38s -> 4044.50s]  favorite cartoon was one punch man that's that's weird well then you have to give me some parameters
[4044.50s -> 4049.37s]  to work in or we're just working within the parameters of like daytime tv cartoons then
[4049.37s -> 4055.93s]  it's got to be the x-men animated series batman animated animated series rug rats doug rennan
[4055.93s -> 4061.77s]  stimpy um cow and chicken like some of those uh uh like johnny bravo i'm just trying to think of
[4061.77s -> 4072.14s]  that era like i watched looney tunes i watched them all cat dog is another one classic uh invader
[4072.14s -> 4079.99s]  zim i did not really catch or care about until much later so i can't say that on that i'm not
[4079.99s -> 4086.31s]  coping i'm setting the parameters there's no opinion in setting the parameter our real monsters
[4086.31s -> 4102.42s]  was also class geek supo so did you like that one no it was okay but like you know it was just okay
[4102.42s -> 4109.45s]  i just don't think you liked the class geek supo style did you not like the art style that's not
[4109.45s -> 4114.10s]  right it has to be what it is i think our real monsters works a bit because they're all supposed
[4114.10s -> 4122.39s]  to be ugly okay well what is your top five top 10 cartoons that you watched i cared about
[4123.51s -> 4131.43s]  not i can't believe not even brought up at all like ed ed and eddie for real but this guy's hell
[4131.43s -> 4136.23s]  wait a minute i don't even care about ed ed and eddie you think that our real monsters is
[4136.23s -> 4141.67s]  ugly and all those i don't like the ugly art styles and i don't like the weird kind of way
[4142.15s -> 4147.03s]  ed ed and eddie had a wild art style they're almost the same it wasn't ugly it wasn't ugly
[4147.03s -> 4154.12s]  no it's not the same it was very close to that kind of old class geek supo style yes it was
[4154.12s -> 4159.56s]  ed ed and eddie would fit in the same category as class geek supo and it's great i liked it i just
[4159.56s -> 4167.54s]  don't think i'd put it in my top five all right ed ed and eddie let's get another one oh hold on
[4167.54s -> 4172.58s]  we have like items we can still purchase more things here if you didn't from the shrine oh i
[4172.58s -> 4177.70s]  was like reading that we can start with like uh twice the amount of health that we started with
[4177.70s -> 4187.18s]  last time that's pretty good and there's like three different tiers of it so should we unlock
[4187.18s -> 4194.76s]  this i'm unlocking this one we don't share these points right uh no so you like unlock the first
[4194.76s -> 4201.34s]  one and then the other ones purchase three more upgrades to unlock the other stuff and then even
[4201.34s -> 4204.94s]  press e you can respect everything anytime it seems i'm just doing health and money
[4210.73s -> 4214.25s]  yeah see this is why it's a roguelike look now we have look at how much health we have
[4217.80s -> 4231.19s]  okay so at ed and eddie uh grim adventures billy and mandy yep that's that's a good one um i forget
[4231.19s -> 4237.85s]  what was what else was on there oh my god how did i how did i screw this up i can't believe it all
[4237.85s -> 4246.25s]  the uh donald duck all the old disney stuff donald duck you like you like yeah like an hour the old
[4246.25s -> 4254.22s]  donald duck cartoons he i i love the old donald duck cartoons donald duck would just like fucking
[4254.22s -> 4259.34s]  lose his shit he would somebody would just donald duck had a really fucking challenging life
[4261.51s -> 4265.59s]  something bad happened to donald duck every episode i don't understand why everyone's like
[4265.59s -> 4269.83s]  oh wow i can't believe donald duck's got such a temper yeah he gets fucked with every episode
[4269.83s -> 4276.50s]  horrible fucking things happen to him every single day i think i'd be a little upset too
[4279.59s -> 4287.42s]  uh yeah the old disney stuff too donald duck especially flapjack that's a good one
[4289.40s -> 4299.08s]  oh he's in the bow wait a minute maybe oh just stand in the back and use the bow it actually
[4299.08s -> 4309.05s]  does not go that far that's a might be hard to use but i'll try it i believe in you i'm gonna i'm
[4309.05s -> 4316.12s]  gonna say sword guy okay uh all right so is that would you consider that to be an accurate
[4316.12s -> 4324.28s]  complete list i i'm confident in saying eddie and eddie and grim adventures are like top two
[4324.28s -> 4329.42s]  they could even share the same place i don't care okay and then third i i don't i don't really know
[4329.42s -> 4334.62s]  like teen titans was pretty pretty good i liked flapjack i like chowder but i don't feel as
[4334.62s -> 4350.76s]  strongly about them as uh the top two i i remember i teen titans confused me a lot because i didn't
[4350.76s -> 4355.64s]  really pay that much attention to it but i i caught another i caught an episode of it and
[4355.64s -> 4362.54s]  they have a different they have like a different series now it's like team titans go and i i've
[4362.54s -> 4367.83s]  heard is good i haven't seen any of it the episodes that i watched the regular teen titans was was
[4367.83s -> 4374.73s]  good i didn't i don't like not like i have anything against it i thought it was a good show i didn't
[4374.73s -> 4378.65s]  really but i i saw that they came with it i didn't know if it was the same thing or not
[4380.39s -> 4390.57s]  well that's because you you had to be into it you had to be shipping raven and beast boy
[4390.57s -> 4393.13s]  if you weren't doing that then were you really even watching it
[4410.22s -> 4416.26s]  it's like the most controversial thing i've ever said bro is flabbergasted
[4417.78s -> 4428.89s]  sir they're kids they're teams for one and i'm not saying i will oh dude i want it to be in the

[4545.10s -> 4559.30s]  that what this says germa praise what i thought it said germa praise pretend he didn't hear him
[4559.30s -> 4567.29s]  oh pray like you started i was like oh i thought it said that i from rain oh lord i told you i'm not
[4567.29s -> 4575.48s]  even being weird today these are like normal people opinions a lot of people agree uh can you pick
[4575.48s -> 4588.78s]  your item please uh i don't know is there a description of how poison works i feel like
[4588.86s -> 4595.02s]  you're the kind of like coward who would use poison like if i ever die from poison it was probably
[4595.02s -> 4602.70s]  you i'm not taking it you can take some poison shit poison is guaranteed damage when you know
[4602.70s -> 4609.98s]  that you can't be there to do it tick damage is so huge affliction warlock was one of the best
[4609.98s -> 4619.14s]  classes in all of world of warcraft you know why why because the dot damage you just walk away and
[4619.14s -> 4623.14s]  you could just dodge mechanics and not actually focus on like contributing actually that is a
[4623.14s -> 4628.10s]  huge deal because you can pay attention to the encounter and not worry about not worry about you
[4628.10s -> 4631.62s]  know don't stand in the shit as they say right don't stand in the thing you could pay attention
[4631.62s -> 4637.38s]  much easier is that your is your favorite wow build of all time you you identify as a affliction
[4637.38s -> 4647.88s]  warlock looks your warlock was awesome not anymore i don't cookie clicker gameplay yeah sorry let's
[4647.88s -> 4676.09s]  just go okay doesn't work the bow is pretty good it seems uh seems good seems good seems good
[4677.05s -> 4688.73s]  when was the last time you actually played affliction warlock i don't know like like 2000
[4688.73s -> 4708.23s]  whatever year it was i can't relate to this wow talk i'm not a wower really this doesn't do that
[4708.23s -> 4719.30s]  much damage at all are you getting the perfect i think so yeah yeah it doesn't look like it is
[4719.94s -> 4738.36s]  i mean it like pierces targets that seems really good i think if you do perfect in a row it's better
[4739.70s -> 4749.94s]  oh that sounds perfect times five all right i gotta be good is this the stream he said he was
[4749.94s -> 4757.98s]  gonna do where he's gonna ditch stir and play breath of the wild um i didn't have a plan to do
[4757.98s -> 4774.47s]  that precision or power power i can't remember what power did i want to get it watch out watch
[4774.47s -> 4784.97s]  out there pal damage plus three holy what they're just handing those out
[4799.40s -> 4805.88s]  look at us not taking any damage we did all right yeah we did pretty good already at the mini boss
[4807.80s -> 4816.39s]  i mean i take i took a few hits but sorry nah we're very distracted nah dude we're good
[4817.27s -> 4829.26s]  we did this guzzle wound don't worry we got this guzzle wound okay but i'm still mad i died on
[4829.26s -> 4832.78s]  that last one because i was behind the guy shooting the laser i just thought about it again
[4846.65s -> 4862.98s]  that was a plus 15 perfects in a row epic epic yeah eat up why did i fucking laugh at that
[4864.10s -> 4873.38s]  what i don't know it's just like weird how you said it i don't it was i don't know yeah man eat up
[4873.38s -> 4878.60s]  but do you got how do you have more gold than me because i am gaming what are you gonna buy
[4881.77s -> 4892.01s]  oh whenever you crit your skills refresh that seems this one seems kind of insane while you
[4892.01s -> 4899.42s]  have 150 gold or more gain bonus move speed and crit i think i can anybody confirm is the perfect
[4899.42s -> 4908.73s]  a guaranteed crit or no it's probably not yeah press tab and like hover over the bow and read
[4908.73s -> 4925.37s]  it i want to buy stuff though uh this thing sounds kind of good all right now i gotta work on crit
[4926.62s -> 4933.11s]  all right can you please say happy birthday to me otherwise i won't just like the sims
[4933.91s -> 4937.27s]  somebody said they if i don't say happy birthday they won't it won't happen or something was it
[4938.07s -> 4958.49s]  happy birthday whoever you were i didn't uh talk to the top right just top left you good
[4959.29s -> 4970.95s]  i'm good happy birthday whoever that is i really shouldn't have gotten hit by that but i did
[4974.79s -> 4984.90s]  you know it happens to the best of us skills selector yeah you get that second skill you start
[4984.90s -> 5018.06s]  popping off oh it's i you identify just like the third of those we found uh blast bomb or
[5018.06s -> 5022.30s]  oh night night's charges night night's charge nice charge every time nice charge yeah why would i
[5022.30s -> 5029.66s]  have picked up night's charge i'm i'm using a bow because uh you're invulnerable while you do it and
[5029.66s -> 5037.82s]  it stuns everything so you could dash away from things kind of like i'll try this oh that's what
[5037.82s -> 5042.71s]  i've been using pretty good not bad pretty good yeah it seems like you've been having a ball with
[5043.51s -> 5054.04s]  yeah absolute ball when is star going to play five nights at freddy's wait while stir plays
[5054.04s -> 5062.70s]  five nights at freddy's can we watch the emoji movie um no that answers the point is to watch
[5062.70s -> 5068.73s]  the point is to watch me play five nights at freddy's i don't know why that's the point but
[5068.73s -> 5085.51s]  that is what the point is that's what that's what he decided he wanted i can't believe you've never
[5085.51s -> 5092.97s]  played five nights not once ever i feel like that's so i don't know how you avoided that
[5093.05s -> 5098.17s]  being a youtuber back in 2012 how did you even avoid not playing it that's like saying you've
[5098.17s -> 5106.74s]  never played minecraft before minecraft's an actual game yeah but i but but you know what i'm
[5106.74s -> 5114.60s]  saying though how did you avoid it but i just didn't do it i just i just played what i wanted
[5114.60s -> 5137.43s]  to play you know what i mean it's 10 hp dude your your health is getting up there man oh there's a
[5137.43s -> 5141.03s]  game that i i want to stream it looks i don't know why i just got reminded of it looks really
[5141.03s -> 5147.67s]  interesting it came out like a golem game yeah brog this is game coming out did you play as
[5147.67s -> 5152.47s]  golem from lord of the rings and you crawl you don't remember that woman i said that one
[5152.47s -> 5160.65s]  before i said that i remember when you said that uh have you heard him do you hear that that was
[5160.65s -> 5173.13s]  weird did anybody hear that i i didn't hear it did you hear like the no i didn't does anybody
[5173.13s -> 5179.19s]  so when you're talking sometimes do you sometimes and people don't ever kind of
[5179.19s -> 5183.83s]  notice that you do it maybe sometimes people hear you do it but do you ever while you're talking
[5183.83s -> 5189.96s]  game you wanted to play just listen when you talk sometimes do you go like this like blah blah blah
[5190.84s -> 5200.01s]  i know that wasn't the game uh did you do that you fucked me up okay do you ever talk and
[5200.01s -> 5207.02s]  sometimes you just go like like you just like yeah and then uh and and so i have to do
[5208.81s -> 5213.77s]  i feel like that happens to way more of us than will care to admit i what is the question i'm
[5213.77s -> 5218.01s]  confused what's the question do you sometimes have like air squeak come out of your throat
[5218.01s -> 5228.42s]  sometimes while you are talking i guess like have you ever noticed that you go like yeah i
[5228.42s -> 5232.66s]  my voice cracked pretty bad the other day no no not a voice crack this is just like air escaping
[5232.66s -> 5240.94s]  in the middle of your sentence just like i think that's kind of the same no a true voice crack is
[5240.94s -> 5252.07s]  like and i no no no i'm talking about you're like yeah and uh i also went to the store i can't hear
[5252.07s -> 5273.82s]  anything so well the people in my my community can oh congrats dude i'm i'm not gaming oh i am
[5274.54s -> 5283.75s]  yeah because you have the bow he even attacked you one you gotta clear the ads they're coming
[5283.75s -> 5296.34s]  after the they're coming after the caster dude well i'm gonna die i'm gonna die dude
[5330.79s -> 5340.54s]  skill damage plus 20 you better not die with that better not die picking that shit up after
[5340.54s -> 5347.43s]  the boss everyone's telling you to apologize oh wait about what apologize for you said
[5348.39s -> 5371.34s]  hold on oh stop who killed that boss because you you you didn't you refused to eat so therefore
[5374.41s -> 5380.81s]  i didn't need to i i've got potato chip grease all over my controller that's what's going on
[5383.69s -> 5393.32s]  okay oh you said ayaya apologize for saying ayaya that's what they're saying i said what's wrong
[5393.32s -> 5407.14s]  with you i'm i'm just relaying what 500 000 people just said i have a question for you sir
[5407.14s -> 5412.26s]  yeah i have a question yeah it always starts like that i got a question for you hey listen
[5412.26s -> 5417.46s]  man i got a question for you okay and i'm gonna answer this question like it's it's a job interview
[5417.46s -> 5427.43s]  okay how long realistically speaking if you and i both sat here and in a high pitch voice said
[5427.43s -> 5432.97s]  ayaya over and over again how long would it take for us to lose 90 percent of reviewers they're
[5432.97s -> 5442.36s]  here be realistic i think like most people would stay yeah for a while to be like how long
[5443.16s -> 5451.26s]  we probably go it's really happening i think it would go up yeah like at a certain point like
[5451.26s -> 5455.50s]  an hour and someone will make like a post on like twitter like dude they're still doing the ayaya
[5455.50s -> 5462.81s]  and like more people show up true especially if we came up with like a good reason for why we were
[5462.81s -> 5468.49s]  doing it like we're doing this to protest the war in vietnam come send our troops home
[5469.75s -> 5479.70s]  ayaya do ayaya for charity
[5490.79s -> 5497.54s]  it's because there's something wrong with you um what's you're just gonna say dragon ball z
[5497.54s -> 5502.90s]  what's your favorite anime we're talking about cartoons now we're gonna talk about adult animated
[5502.90s -> 5509.06s]  cartoons from japan i can tell you that because i have seen quite a few
[5510.02s -> 5517.78s]  uh it is not what everybody in here thinks it is my favorite okay so let me say
[5521.45s -> 5532.10s]  okay i really do genuinely love the entire concept and i'm a big i'm a big concept guy right oh this
[5532.10s -> 5539.38s]  guy i don't i don't really care about um i just love like just i want to interrupt i love
[5540.50s -> 5543.86s]  that was the first time i've really done it but i asked you a question and then i watched your
[5543.86s -> 5551.50s]  gameplay and i just fucking i loved it how quickly it degraded you were just like charging arrows and
[5551.50s -> 5562.50s]  shooting at like walls i was yeah anyway so back back on track favorite anime this the concept of
[5562.50s -> 5566.66s]  this series and we're talking that this could be uh most
[5577.94s -> 5582.82s]  so good i'm just giving hey do you ever think that if you have like do you ever think that
[5582.82s -> 5587.54s]  you have a dog right yes i don't know why i just thought of this but like do you ever think that
[5587.54s -> 5593.86s]  like your dog is usually if they're over the age of 10 they're like 60 you ever think that it's
[5593.86s -> 5598.02s]  like funny that there's like some 70 year old just 70 year old dude just lying on your couch
[5600.14s -> 5604.46s]  i've never thought of it like that you ever think it's like think do you ever think your
[5604.46s -> 5611.26s]  dog just lying there like ah yeah this is comfortable can i have some food it's just
[5611.26s -> 5619.00s]  like a 70 year old guy just lying on the couch okay i like pick auto up and i'm like oh let's

[5647.11s -> 5654.42s]  better one punch man yeah people keep saying that but um i gotta get i gotta okay the concept of
[5654.42s -> 5662.39s]  one punch man the entire series it's that's a really interesting series is well i don't spoil
[5662.39s -> 5666.55s]  anything but what that that's a concept that i find very interesting because i need to see
[5666.55s -> 5670.63s]  where they're going with it like i need to know where they're going with that because you know
[5670.63s -> 5677.37s]  it's gonna something has to happen right it's an amazing concept uh something something does have
[5677.37s -> 5682.57s]  to happen in the show well but i mean something it makes you think about like wait what's going
[5682.57s -> 5692.26s]  on here what the heck's happening here i feel you music um when when he goes in for a punch
[5692.90s -> 5697.94s]  when satama goes for a punch and they play that fucking song that like
[5706.06s -> 5713.14s]  oh man just like look he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he's gonna do it and you know it's gonna
[5713.14s -> 5719.38s]  happen and you know it's you know what's gonna happen and then he does it and he does it and
[5719.38s -> 5728.42s]  then the thing he won and then there was one punch so i am just i need to know what's going
[5728.42s -> 5737.03s]  on there that's why i like that show but now that you know what's going on there i don't that change
[5737.03s -> 5742.78s]  it i don't i don't i actually don't know what i don't i what do you mean you don't know did you

[5766.42s -> 5771.22s]  don't know how to read i'm pretty sure it's over it's still going i think there's still some more
[5771.22s -> 5778.28s]  left i think it's coming close the mount the manga is coming close to ending isn't it the
[5778.28s -> 5782.60s]  manga is ongoing there's a lot more in the box yeah all right i'm serious you you will get
[5782.60s -> 5787.16s]  brought from this community i don't want to see shit over here mods you know what to do if you see
[5787.16s -> 5803.42s]  the real shit okay okay all right uh if it's not one punch man i mean full metal alchemist is
[5803.42s -> 5808.94s]  a really simple oh yeah you're you're i remember you're you're a full metal alchemist killed it
[5808.94s -> 5816.22s]  was cool i liked it and you're telling me that you don't ship winry with anyone
[5818.86s -> 5839.48s]  i just i enjoyed the show man okay i enjoyed the television show okay somebody said stop him
[5840.12s -> 5848.30s]  what do you mean do you guys know that humans like are romantically intertwined on the regular
[5849.10s -> 5854.70s]  like it's normal for a man and a woman or whoever wants to like kiss whoever is like totally that
[5854.70s -> 5865.19s]  happens all the time i'm seeing all these like cat leaning memes what is this cat like leaning
[5865.19s -> 5893.29s]  thing oh fuck i'm gonna die chat your mom and your dad kissed shut up passionately your mom
[5893.29s -> 5912.26s]  and your dad kissed passionately and some someone's mom could be raven and someone's mom or dad could
[5912.26s -> 5931.32s]  be beast boy what's wrong with that breaking hearts what you ready to fight the boss yeah
[5933.43s -> 5938.10s]  don't die or if you're gonna die it's a good room to do it because you you wake up afterwards
[5939.59s -> 5960.79s]  but you haven't fought this boss before so you're gonna watch out for his ice attacks all right which
[5960.79s -> 5965.91s]  one of the teen titans would you want to be what i want to be like if like oh what what teen titan
[5966.31s -> 5982.46s]  let's just say you took one of those quizzes oh man um i'd want to be raven is it is it
[5982.46s -> 5990.25s]  cliche and lame to say robin kind of i i i was thinking that and i was thinking you were going
[5990.25s -> 5995.77s]  to say that because robin's superpower is having social control over everyone and that seems like
[5995.77s -> 5999.85s]  the thing that you'd be into it's just just like any anyone says some shit you just shut it down
[6000.73s -> 6008.97s]  well i was gonna say because i like nightwing but okay well i guess we'll take that what do you like
[6008.97s -> 6017.13s]  about nightwing what's not that like about nightwing i got big got big shoes to fill you know
[6017.13s -> 6023.69s]  that's a lot of pressure um you know batman's what essentially is this uh you know sidekick right
[6023.69s -> 6029.45s]  and then all of you know wants to be that's a lot of pressure i like the idea of you know he lives
[6029.45s -> 6046.20s]  up to it okay you buying anything he also people saying he's got a huge ass nightwing he i honestly
[6046.20s -> 6050.60s]  have never really thought about it but to like recollect the trailers that had nightwing in it
[6051.16s -> 6060.71s]  he did have a big ass yeah i got something in common with nightwing because it's huge
[6063.56s -> 6077.83s]  yeah yeah you're not wrong the snowball was all right try this are we good what was the
[6077.83s -> 6083.43s]  quote what were we oh what teen titan you would want to be yeah you said x-men was one of your
[6083.43s -> 6095.14s]  favorite shows so which x-men are you um i would say nightcrawler because of the x-men arcade game
[6095.14s -> 6101.70s]  my favorite character yeah i'm like nightcrawler i know if it wasn't nightcrawler then it would
[6101.70s -> 6108.65s]  probably be either cyclops or probably cyclops or gambit oh beast no beast beast is an easy answer
[6109.21s -> 6119.69s]  i like beast what about him i just want to be smart incredibly intelligent he's got brain he's
[6119.69s -> 6130.73s]  got uh he's got physical ability he's he's got a problem solving he's reasonable i think that's
[6130.73s -> 6146.01s]  he's got leadership written all over but i was saying i don't know what i i i don't i just i
[6146.01s -> 6152.02s]  don't know what i wonder what i would why have been hanging out with me way too much i have fun
[6152.02s -> 6162.12s]  i'm getting germ uphill my heart for some reason again is telling me that it would be cool to be
[6162.12s -> 6168.50s]  dark phoenix and just end the world like like if the world's gotta end wouldn't it be cool if
[6168.50s -> 6176.82s]  he's like i did it i mean kind of i mean i look up in the sky and i just see you up there floating
[6176.82s -> 6181.22s]  you know what my like least favorite superhero trope is i've been thinking a lot about lately
[6181.22s -> 6184.42s]  i don't know why it like keeps coming up and i keep thinking about it there's always the one
[6184.42s -> 6191.94s]  hero who has an awesome ability and then does the like it's my burden to have this power i didn't
[6191.94s -> 6196.58s]  ask for this oh my god i don't want to have this strength and they have like the best
[6196.58s -> 6202.42s]  fucking power in the whole show but they're like not happy about it so wasn't it like uh not uh
[6203.22s -> 6210.17s]  the one who touched people was gene gray or just like man i'm so sick of being able to have any
[6210.17s -> 6218.90s]  superpower i want at any time make it go away rogue it was rogue yeah oh okay i was like what's he
[6218.90s -> 6225.30s]  talking about i was like what what what x-men character just touches people yeah rogue i'm not
[6225.30s -> 6233.22s]  just oh no no okay weird you're the one being weird okay no i'm saying i was i'm genuinely
[6233.22s -> 6243.83s]  trying to figure out who like their power is they like they go like this i'm dead unfortunate
[6244.55s -> 6248.47s]  how do you have 70 how we've been talking this whole time how do you have 72 health
[6249.43s -> 6254.07s]  uh because instead of taking the max health perk i took the heal five after every room
[6254.07s -> 6260.87s]  because that sounded really by the way rogues power is not touching people power is absorption
[6262.39s -> 6272.74s]  absorption stupid idiot sorry i'm i'm sorry i got really i feel like i'm sorry no i i got i just got

[6562.26s -> 6569.30s]  that i'm looking at oh no i mean the one the one that helps the one that would have food one
[6570.66s -> 6578.66s]  i don't know my bad wait am i just in my house right then the food one

[6591.45s -> 6596.49s]  have not sat around and been like oh man imagine if i was like a powerful being and i could fly
[6596.49s -> 6602.49s]  and i could like defend everybody like everybody's had that oh yeah i imagine if i imagine if opening
[6602.49s -> 6620.44s]  my eyes only caused destruction fly does not mean defend yeah what i you got me so fucked up here
[6620.44s -> 6630.09s]  this is so funny you try to stir you have never worse have you never stood in the mirror like this
[6632.41s -> 6635.69s]  i gotta see what you're doing you never stood in the mirror like this and been like
[6635.69s -> 6641.88s]  leave everything to me you've never done that before you never start have been like leave
[6641.88s -> 6647.88s]  everything to these citizens you've never done that that's that's the saddest thing you've ever
[6647.88s -> 6654.55s]  said that not only do you do that but you're so shocked another human being wouldn't stand in
[6654.55s -> 6663.56s]  the mirror and do that i do i do it naked in the mirror so i do it naked in the mirror you're
[6663.56s -> 6667.64s]  gonna be mad at me for that too i do it naked in the mirror uh after getting out of the shower
[6667.64s -> 6675.64s]  every morning i said look at the mirror there's nothing wrong with that i mean if you got the
[6675.64s -> 6690.81s]  body for it and honey i know you do okay you haven't played this data before what would your
[6690.81s -> 6697.42s]  power be again mr perfect okay well if i'm the only one in the world that has a power i can't
[6697.42s -> 6705.35s]  pick rogue rogue is the obvious because you just get literally every power um uh i don't know
[6705.35s -> 6710.39s]  wolverine gets like that wolverine's another one he gets to live forever as like the strongest dude
[6710.39s -> 6716.79s]  in the fucking world he's like i'm so i just wish i would die man i'm so bored of being the strongest
[6717.35s -> 6720.87s]  guy who lives forever it doesn't have to worry about disease or anything
[6722.31s -> 6728.54s]  everyone who's strong is fucking they just they hate it you just don't like i don't know wolverine
[6728.54s -> 6735.42s]  or or charles xavier you just gave me shit for saying leave everything to me in the mirror
[6735.90s -> 6742.60s]  but you are psycho analyzing every x-men character i'm just bringing up the trope that i don't like
[6742.60s -> 6747.00s]  where everyone who is strong hates that they are strong and it's a burden on them like everyone
[6747.00s -> 6753.32s]  else doesn't have like real problems wolverine's problem is that he is immune to everything and he
[6753.32s -> 6761.69s]  hates it um that's it's the total opposite of what you're doing where you go in the mirror leave it
[6761.69s -> 6766.49s]  to me citizens wolverine's version of that is going in the mirror and saying i could save i could
[6766.49s -> 6779.54s]  save them but i'm sad about it you've definitely done that in the mirror before i mean like i just
[6779.54s -> 6786.54s]  but hey you added extra context though well wait what was the extra context am i not allowed to
[6786.54s -> 6792.46s]  elaborate and continue the conversation all right so here's my point so when you ask somebody hey
[6792.46s -> 6797.02s]  what would your what would your what would you have for a superpower and the person just goes
[6797.02s -> 6800.22s]  like they're like i don't know they're eating a sandwich like laser eyes i guess i don't know
[6800.78s -> 6804.06s]  monster you're a monster you're a monster you're a monster weird
[6805.74s -> 6813.32s]  the first thing that comes to your mind being laser eyes is weird i thought a superman has a
[6813.32s -> 6819.24s]  cyclops it's just like an easy like i guess i don't know flight laser eyes no flight would be normal
[6819.24s -> 6824.36s]  flight oh everyone wants to fly not everyone wants to and especially specifically cyclops
[6824.36s -> 6830.65s]  right can't control it and just does it he has special glasses do you want to wear special
[6830.65s -> 6834.65s]  glasses the rest of your life and if you ever take them off you like kill all of your loved
[6834.65s -> 6843.29s]  ones you just wake up in the morning and you're just like ah all right it's gonna be a good day
[6843.29s -> 6850.71s]  today you just blow a hole in your ceiling through it yeah oh my oh sorry my glasses came off honey
[6850.71s -> 6860.49s]  are you still there what was your power what was it i forget what it was i was all being it was
[6860.49s -> 6865.37s]  being able to change it was you wanted to change into like other people dude i would take power
[6865.45s -> 6872.89s]  mystique would be good xavier would be good wolverine would be good why wouldn't you xavier
[6875.82s -> 6880.30s]  charles xavier i feel like that would be too much i don't know if i want that just to like
[6880.30s -> 6885.66s]  tap into the room and like nsa anyone in the world and that and what and wait whoa
[6887.26s -> 6895.10s]  me wanting laser eyes is crazy but you wanting to tap into everybody's brain is completely
[6895.10s -> 6901.40s]  normal human behavior very interesting you ever fantasize about like if you had the power to like
[6901.40s -> 6916.68s]  stop time you would just use it to be better at video games yeah yeah i do yeah that's bad
[6917.48s -> 6923.46s]  i would i would just join a speedrun category and just and just have a world record that's
[6923.46s -> 6933.18s]  unbeatable you'd be a fucking track mania player all right let's let's let's gravitate
[6933.18s -> 6944.90s]  it to a more normal conversation do you have one yeah stir one germa zero um at this point
[6944.90s -> 6951.22s]  it's probably like stir 12 germa like eight or so we've been having a lot of conversations
[6951.22s -> 6961.82s]  who's keeping who's keeping track who's scoring our conversation yeah yeah cut that shit up
[6962.62s -> 6973.53s]  score would be funny though what are you guys scoring this what's the score what are you guys
[6973.53s -> 6986.30s]  scoring this right now this is a boxing match which means to us too biased one oh stir like
[6986.30s -> 6992.71s]  they just joined the stream well that's what i'm saying they were like one one bit yeah you're
[6992.71s -> 7007.72s]  both basically dead at this point stir is 15 and you're at a two no way no way who is the guy that
[7007.72s -> 7012.76s]  could run at super speed like the but not the flash the the x-men version quicksilver who does
[7012.84s -> 7019.30s]  nothing in every movie i would be quicksilver but i'd do something in the movie people would
[7019.30s -> 7024.66s]  argue that quicksilver is parts in those movies were the only good parts of those movies exactly
[7024.66s -> 7052.71s]  and i would be those parts oh shit holy shit i didn't even tell you about the game i know
[7053.35s -> 7060.94s]  i tried to get us back on that for a second um and we sort of just we went off on a bit of a

[8330.47s -> 8351.00s]  spongebob that's a good hero choice jim carries the mask that also works except the mask is always on
[8352.52s -> 8369.61s]  it never comes off you'd be captain underpants that's a good hero no i doubt it i doubt it
[8370.41s -> 8389.30s]  i'm seeing a lot of trues for captain underpants i disagree i would be anubis the egyptian god
[8390.36s -> 8411.02s]  of death what i'd be the joker this guy wants laser eyes and to be the the egyptian god of
[8411.02s -> 8418.34s]  death and judge everyone who dies forever that's fucked up and you're missing standing in the mirror
[8420.74s -> 8437.42s]  and monologuing well what if you you go to you go to monologue legendary relic but my hp is never

[8465.06s -> 8472.89s]  it does that's so stupid he really i kind of assumed you were thinking of anubis as well
[8473.69s -> 8477.13s]  because you would want to like shoot your cocoon at someone and then talk to them for 10 minutes
[8477.77s -> 8486.60s]  well let me explain to you baddies what you've done wrong here
[8487.00s -> 8499.34s]  hahaha i don't see i don't see you helping and then once they finally understand that's when you

[8554.22s -> 8563.66s]  be the the in the ninja turtles the reporter girl we just we just talk about what people are doing
[8566.07s -> 8573.59s]  uh now there's no way that i'm not michael angelo i'm sorry i've not i'm gonna have to argue that
[8574.31s -> 8593.80s]  which one's michael angelo like the smart one whoa man if you don't pick up immediately who i'm
[8593.80s -> 8600.18s]  talking about you've never ever ever orange one orange one orange one orange one that guy goes
[8600.18s -> 8610.52s]  that guy goes crazy you know actually why why i find uh nunchucks to be a really real you just
[8610.52s -> 8617.53s]  laugh at me i saw a nunchuck meme like a week ago i totally agree with it just made me think
[8617.53s -> 8625.21s]  about it nunchucks is such a they're they're such an unbelievable it's like a dance it's like a
[8625.69s -> 8635.69s]  dance it takes a ton of skill to use it it's just like so for no benefit i mean i think that
[8636.49s -> 8643.21s]  what would you use the the meme was about how just a stick is better than a nunchuck
[8645.24s -> 8649.88s]  yeah but there's deception with a nunchuck let's understand is is there that's the whole point
[8649.88s -> 8656.92s]  because it's like boom right in the jaw okay but like but you're fighting someone who has like a
[8656.92s -> 8661.64s]  real weapon like a spear they haven't trained for like 10 years to learn how to use the spear
[8661.64s -> 8667.94s]  and they just like poke you once if a spear is overpowered everybody knows that so you're
[8667.94s -> 8674.23s]  you're good enough that you don't need to use a spear but spear is spear is always going to be
[8674.23s -> 8687.21s]  the best weapon throw at history that's accurate right yeah spear does everything okay so we're
[8687.21s -> 8691.05s]  no one's allowed to pick spear it's too strong yeah we're like in the middle of our picking
[8691.05s -> 8697.08s]  ban phase and i banned spear okay cannot bring that to the battle what would make you want to use
[8697.72s -> 8708.25s]  nunchucks over like a flail which is just nunchucks but with a threatening part have you have you seen
[8708.25s -> 8713.72s]  what some people can do with nunchucks you almost can't even see them they're like helicopters
[8715.50s -> 8721.75s]  okay but then like it okay putting myself in i'm in the combat situation you've got your nunchucks
[8721.75s -> 8726.71s]  and you're a master we're just assuming you're a master i've had a flail and i know how to use
[8726.71s -> 8731.54s]  it because i've i just i've never used one but it's like a flail how could you not use it
[8731.54s -> 8736.02s]  i think i win that fight if i just like take the hits and flail you one time
[8736.02s -> 8741.48s]  okay but you're also missing the the potential comedy of that weapon where you do the whoa whoa
[8741.48s -> 8751.72s]  whoa whoa whoa oops i hit myself in the balls you're missing that i i totally forgot that we're
[8751.72s -> 8758.50s]  we're we're using the weapons for comedy you completely forgot that aspect of it we trained
[8758.50s -> 8773.27s]  him wrong as a joke okay i i feel like same conversation let's take it let's take it down
[8773.27s -> 8784.09s]  a small a small notch okay what dinner food are you you're not a super you don't get to be like
[8784.09s -> 8795.00s]  a cool super like what dinner are you for this mind space quiz okay i'm serious a spicy chili
[8797.13s -> 8800.73s]  i don't know something about the i'm serious is like you've thought about this and you know
[8800.73s -> 8805.77s]  i'm a chili i'm definitely a chili just a bunch of shit in a pot and just like it's so like
[8805.77s -> 8810.01s]  get everything good beans in there you got meat in there so you got like sauce put some fucking hot
[8810.01s -> 8815.45s]  sauce in it it's just kind of like sloppy but it's unbelievable gets the job done it's perfect
[8816.46s -> 8828.33s]  i would be a chili i would be a spicy chili and by the way i last a long time whoa all right
[8829.29s -> 8835.99s]  okay i want to pick what you get to pick for me what am i what kind of food am i what dinner meal
[8840.52s -> 8848.02s]  i you know what you're gonna be mad you get i think you're gonna be mad is gonna pick something

[8859.56s -> 8867.18s]  with one smear of mustard on the bottom of the bread on the bottom on the bottom of the bread
[8867.18s -> 8883.90s]  not in the sandwich yeah honestly you're you're you're you're a slice of pizza because everyone
[8883.90s -> 8891.30s]  likes pizza i think is and you could you could put anything on me yeah i think that you'd be
[8891.30s -> 8899.13s]  like a nice slice of pizza thank you that's a lot better than a ham sandwich with mustard on the
[8899.13s -> 8905.59s]  bottom i know i was just being mean for no reason i was just being rude all right well no now you'd
[8905.59s -> 8911.35s]  be mean to me i you wait you want me to be mean to you what food am i i said i was chili what do
[8911.35s -> 8926.62s]  you your turn uh hmm and don't say boogers that doesn't count as food i sometimes sometimes

[8933.59s -> 8939.19s]  spaghetti by the way ham sandwich i said that's not even rude you know how versatile a ham sandwich is
[8940.38s -> 8945.50s]  i do like ham sandwiches do you know ham sandwich can come in in the clutch and really bail your
[8945.50s -> 8953.03s]  ass out big time and the and that hint of mustard is a is a is enough of a kick to keep you going
[8953.98s -> 8962.25s]  i'm i'm happy to know that that's how you feel about me what when has anybody ever
[8963.69s -> 8968.09s]  turned down or complained about a nice ham sandwich with mustard on it i can't think of
[8968.09s -> 8972.81s]  anyone with i i feel like a lot of people would complain about the mustard i don't know i don't
[8972.81s -> 8977.61s]  think so not a lot of people are in the monster i think a ham sandwich is a versatile
[8978.49s -> 8989.35s]  just any occasion it's always a good choice okay all right what dessert am i
[8994.17s -> 9000.65s]  what dessert are you what dessert am i i honest to goodness i don't even know that many desserts

[9337.37s -> 9342.31s]  though uh it does say stack so i would have to assume it's stacked you have to assume that right
[9342.31s -> 9343.35s]  you have to assume it
[9354.09s -> 9359.37s]  if you could pick any element that became alive and could be your friend what would it be any
[9359.37s -> 9369.96s]  element like are you saying like a like an ember fire head element would be your friend i mean like

[9385.66s -> 9393.40s]  i'm sorry i'm pretty confused especially when your example is helium could helium come alive
[9393.40s -> 9400.49s]  and be my friend i feel like that is not even one of the like strangest things we've talked
[9400.49s -> 9406.74s]  about today i think it is it might be but is it you don't want this you want some skill damage
[9407.22s -> 9418.82s]  uh i'll take it uh gold is the most precious of metals oh yeah so you could you could melt

[9485.58s -> 9495.67s]  the first stream that i've caught in a long time and they have a sort of weird i think for both of
[9495.67s -> 9502.97s]  us this is the first stream in a long time i think we're just usually weird i think we're just
[9502.97s -> 9509.53s]  messing around i've been i've been very honest open and vulnerable tonight yeah
[9515.03s -> 9526.60s]  messing around just a little bit of a joke you know you guys are fun to watch hey cool we're glad
[9537.21s -> 9541.05s]  uh i do you want to be faster i feel like i've gotten like three of these

[9549.80s -> 9566.66s]  with these i don't think i need to change them dude that room we just annihilated them we were in
[9566.66s -> 9572.58s]  that room for like 30 milliseconds i was gonna say you know seconds are too long um they didn't
[9572.58s -> 9577.45s]  give me the crit gem i was gonna say can you reroll no there was a there was like a perk for
[9577.45s -> 9585.83s]  that but i don't think i took it what's your guy's favorite chips i actually have the answer to this
[9585.83s -> 9596.95s]  if anybody wants to know it a lot of you already know i've got i've got chip related trauma no
[9596.95s -> 9603.67s]  so there's another story did you did your brother like okay when i was really young again
[9603.67s -> 9610.20s]  when i was really young my brother he's older and his friend they're older i'm the young i'm
[9610.20s -> 9617.16s]  the younger brother he made a son chip baseball and he no he did one of the my brother's friend
[9617.16s -> 9620.92s]  was like man i could really go for some chips right now and i was super into it too and i was
[9620.92s -> 9625.32s]  like yeah i could go for some chips and then i found out like an hour later after this whole
[9625.32s -> 9631.16s]  like chip debacle that they weren't talking about chocolate chips and i felt very foolish
[9633.62s -> 9639.30s]  i mean that and that kind of ruined my life honestly i feel like you were i feel like you
[9639.30s -> 9643.38s]  were implying oh double you're gonna want to focus up for the phalanx throws
[9645.46s -> 9676.44s]  i won my fight we do more damage than i do you've taken all the damage items you've taken all the
[9676.44s -> 9681.56s]  damage gems oh okay now it's my fault that i'm doing more damage can you fucking eat this meat
[9682.62s -> 9692.26s]  uh okay so what is your favorite chip no um dude i don't i'm not really a chip guy at all
[9695.50s -> 9700.87s]  not really i mean it's got to go with something and then at that point it's more about what it's
[9700.87s -> 9706.22s]  going with than the actual chip you know it's like a delivery device and then i really care
[9706.22s -> 9721.43s]  anymore max relics oh shit i have to get rid of this uh can i even get rid of this
[9726.26s -> 9732.44s]  can i drop a relic because i just thought you farted i thought that was a huge fart
[9732.44s -> 9741.50s]  it's like why did you play that over the mic i thought that was the fart reverb sound oh i
[9741.50s -> 9748.74s]  misunderstood this one too i don't really want it shit i just i have i guess i'll take it it's
[9748.74s -> 9758.71s]  weird i if you can use that take it i apparently why couldn't i why couldn't you i fold relic
[9758.71s -> 9771.26s]  slots apparently how i don't know i only have i have two okay i have wait now i have four relics
[9771.26s -> 9777.42s]  i can't go down to the second slot you already have that relic oh like you can't have more than
[9777.42s -> 9791.03s]  one yeah oh i thought you could just kind of stack them so you're not a chip guy are you
[9791.83s -> 9798.31s]  any type of salty snack kind of what does that i mean like i i like chips but like i was thinking
[9798.31s -> 9801.91s]  it has to go with something so it's more about what it goes with like i'll have chips with cottage
[9801.91s -> 9808.31s]  cheese is you know like a consistent thing for me you know if you're in like a like nachos with
[9808.31s -> 9816.58s]  something that sounds cool do you do salt and pepper on cottage cheese no no but you that's
[9817.22s -> 9834.17s]  you would like it oh what are you going to cook for me
[9835.38s -> 9843.77s]  what do you want what do you like cooking what do you want i want what you like cooking salmon
[9843.77s -> 9847.29s]  every time every time someone's like oh i like cooking and i cook this all the time and then i
[9847.29s -> 9852.73s]  see them and i'm like hey you know cooking's cool i'll even help i'm not like asking to be like
[9852.73s -> 9859.82s]  served but like i like to see what people are into and what they're cooking good looking uh i like
[9860.62s -> 9866.38s]  you want the damage too you might as well take it what are you going to cook for me
[9866.94s -> 9872.46s]  i mean that's that's a very broad question i mean what do you what do you feel like today
[9872.46s -> 9880.06s]  i want what i want what you like okay so what what i want to experience you okay it's not about
[9880.70s -> 9888.33s]  so if i were to make food i don't know like pretty good pasta salad right now that's what i would
[9888.33s -> 9892.73s]  probably have like a specialty like oh yeah i cook this i do like a real good job salmon
[9892.73s -> 9895.77s]  egg salad i make a mean egg salad i make a good salmon in the oven
[9896.73s -> 9909.03s]  uh a good cod in the pan i'm a uh i'm a big fan of um do you make an egg salad
[9909.83s -> 9914.39s]  i actually do or is that kind of like making cereal where you just sort of put the milk in
[9914.39s -> 9922.07s]  the cereal together yeah it kind of is but there's some secrets okay oh okay i didn't i didn't know
[9923.03s -> 9933.11s]  all right burgers not not a pasta salad kind of guy pasta salad is a great quick and simple meal
[9933.11s -> 9939.43s]  and i said meal because if you put you know put a bunch of broccoli in pasta salad olives and shit
[9939.43s -> 9948.81s]  like get get everything in there make it a whole thing pasta broccoli olives tuna get it all in
[9949.61s -> 9956.70s]  hey you're but you're you're a salmon person i i do like salmon i kind of feel like anyone
[9956.70s -> 9961.98s]  who likes salmon like your taste buds are just fucked up i i do there's like probably 500
[9961.98s -> 9967.66s]  billion people in the universe and when i'm talking multi around each universe i'm not talking about
[9967.66s -> 9975.26s]  just that just actually gassed when you said that i know i'm aware like when i go to the grocery
[9975.26s -> 9979.26s]  store sometimes i like to buy the like they have like the pre-made like here you go like pre-made
[9979.26s -> 9985.14s]  package like ready to go like ham like the the pork that i left in my backpack yeah other room
[9985.14s -> 9991.86s]  we don't need to heal uh it's always like three dishes of pork and then the rest everything else
[9991.86s -> 9997.54s]  like a hundred options of salmon if i feel like they're just trying to get rid of this shit
[9998.94s -> 10004.14s]  like there's a warehouse somewhere with just like way too much salmon in it i mean it's it's probably
[10004.14s -> 10011.56s]  one of the most popular foods in in the world i would say i mean i don't know what the statistics
[10011.56s -> 10017.64s]  in the united states are salmon is very very very popular it's like a staple of a lot of people's
[10019.16s -> 10029.83s]  diets i think a lot fish uh cod salmon a haddock those are staples i feel like if you if you had to
[10029.83s -> 10042.58s]  have salmon would be like lowest on my list do you like like absolute bottom no no really um i
[10042.58s -> 10051.43s]  feel like i'd rather have tuna but okay what about tuna fish from the can that sounds disgusting
[10051.43s -> 10060.47s]  yeah i'll take the salmon no no no no no no no people just have such a bad opinion of salmon
[10060.47s -> 10067.27s]  out of the can and it's just you just gotta gotta trust me you just gotta hold your nose
[10067.27s -> 10077.29s]  no he's gotta you have to trust me all right everyone will be quiet watch out for his attack
[10077.85s -> 10095.26s]  he's gonna freeze you you're getting hit you're just standing still what do you
[10096.94s -> 10104.58s]  stop making me make jokes that aren't funny i would love it if you made funny jokes
[10105.30s -> 10152.79s]  like this this ain't on me he's just hitting he's landing them on me not you oh you got this
[10162.02s -> 10171.22s]  epic i will i will die on this hill doing a fish out of the can solid like you get get a good solid
[10171.22s -> 10176.82s]  albacore tuna and you're gonna take that you're gonna mix it obviously with mayo
[10178.34s -> 10181.54s]  interrupting your favorite fish though is your favorite fish salmon or tuna
[10182.42s -> 10189.14s]  it realistically is probably tuna it's probably tuna fish like all seafood like even like we're
[10189.14s -> 10197.98s]  talking like crab lobster i like crab i don't like lobster weirdly enough i actually don't really like
[10197.98s -> 10208.57s]  um lobster at all probably probably uh probably weird for this one but i think if i had to have
[10208.57s -> 10215.74s]  any seafood of all things it's calamari see now you lost me big time but yeah i don't know how you
[10215.74s -> 10222.30s]  will think that eating squid is fine but salmon is gross to you how doesn't make any sense it just
[10222.30s -> 10231.26s]  tastes weird how does it make any sense squid and has such a distinct odd flavor i i'm not
[10231.26s -> 10239.16s]  really it does salmon and if you they both seafood right but how do you like calamari but you don't
[10239.16s -> 10247.08s]  you hate salmon it's just it's salmon just tastes weird like sign me up for like almost any other
[10247.08s -> 10257.24s]  fish really that's really i think tuna fish and pretzels i know i've changed at least a few
[10257.24s -> 10266.76s]  people's lives here i just have my life was i was living a shallow existence i was germa streamed
[10266.76s -> 10274.76s]  he said because he said eat what what was it tuna fish so i'm talking canned tuna you take it out
[10274.76s -> 10278.76s]  of the container you mix it up like make a tuna like like as if you were gonna put it in like a
[10278.76s -> 10285.48s]  sandwich i'm talking tuna fish sandwich tuna fish you put mayo mix it up add whatever bullshit you
[10285.48s -> 10289.32s]  want to make it the way you want it but you no actually don't do that just do it normally
[10289.32s -> 10295.85s]  and take pretzel sticks pretzel cylinders wait i'm confused because i just had to throw out the
[10295.85s -> 10301.66s]  first half of the recipe i read the recipe and step five was throw out the first half okay
[10302.38s -> 10308.78s]  it's not drunk food it's not it's not high food it's not drunk food it's just good shit i'm telling
[10308.78s -> 10318.12s]  you a lot of people just write it off and they don't even give it a chance this one's probably
[10318.12s -> 10326.58s]  good something to do with the way the pretzels interact with the tuna fish i don't know what it
[10326.58s -> 10332.18s]  is there's gonna somebody that's in the science community please help someone who knows science
[10332.26s -> 10346.54s]  tell me why i like this food no i'm serious it's weird it changes completely i understand it's so
[10346.54s -> 10381.91s]  good exactly the combination is it's relentlessly good the salt no no it's it can't be it's the
[10381.91s -> 10392.84s]  molecular interaction between the salt the bread and the fish you must just like sodium whoa whoa
[10393.00s -> 10399.19s]  hold on a second check it out scientist in chat the pretzels contain an enzyme called
[10399.19s -> 10404.55s]  forazine that reacts with tuna proteins since they're long chain proteins they tend to spool
[10404.55s -> 10414.18s]  and it creates a stringy what i just didn't read i did i read something fucked up i didn't just
[10414.18s -> 10420.78s]  read something like fucked up right i i i don't know i don't know neither do i if we're gonna
[10420.78s -> 10432.30s]  keep talking about tuna and shit i'm checking out it's so good i know people like i'm a hater
[10432.30s -> 10437.18s]  i'm a hater i hate him but just if you ever have an opportunity and you just like you're if
[10437.18s -> 10440.46s]  you're at like the grocery store and just like you're in the tuna and pretzel aisle it's just
[10440.46s -> 10447.34s]  like the tuna and pretzel aisle i fucking hate that guy but uh you know what fuck him i want
[10447.34s -> 10459.69s]  to prove him wrong buy it prove me wrong tell me i'm wrong and you're gonna you're gonna fucking
[10459.69s -> 10465.54s]  bite into it and it's gonna be like a five gum commercial it's gonna be like

[10484.50s -> 10498.17s]  which x-men would you fuck cutting cutting right to the chase no more dancing around

[10743.16s -> 10747.40s]  and in between like combat they'd pause for like 10 seconds and we'd get to have the anime moment
[10747.40s -> 10751.56s]  where they're like i don't know what to do and i i'm the sword and i'm like you need to look within
[10751.56s -> 10760.52s]  sun and we'd have the whole conversation you need to do a charged attack fucking idiot again do
[10760.52s -> 10768.47s]  another one more one more charged attack with moon veil you know i used moon veil for half that
[10768.55s -> 10779.58s]  playthrough when i my first playthrough it was fun you should get that looking a little low

[10809.48s -> 10813.72s]  said like now we had to be weird oh so you were like okay now that he's like not going to be
[10813.72s -> 10818.36s]  entertaining and carry my stream for me i might have to like pull some weight don't tell anybody

[10823.58s -> 10827.74s]  i'm just gonna get to chill and play some like whatever and then i started by saying nope not
[10827.74s -> 10840.22s]  today i just i don't know i don't know like funnier than you i'm sorry i had to tell a joke
[10843.66s -> 10866.78s]  tell a joke tell a joke right now all right i hate that i hate when someone's like telling
[10866.78s -> 10876.62s]  joke that's the worst thing is there anything worse in the whole universe um i don't know
[10876.62s -> 10883.58s]  maybe ordering pickup at a restaurant i always feel like i fuck up when i second guess everything
[10883.58s -> 10892.54s]  i just say what i feel like i screw up every time it's just like oh hey yeah what what can i
[10892.54s -> 10898.22s]  get you uh and are you wait wait wait wait you know the internet happened right you don't like
[10898.22s -> 10901.26s]  you don't no one orders pickup anymore on the phone what are you talking about
[10902.33s -> 10914.52s]  do you call the place i mean yeah not every single restaurant in the world
[10914.52s -> 10941.78s]  operates on like fucking uber what are you talking about yeah they do boomer yeah that was good this
[10941.78s -> 10947.38s]  is like this this is the equivalent of the airplane food kind of like no one like when
[10947.38s -> 10954.98s]  you call the place to order food who who does that who's relating to this how but do you order
[10954.98s -> 10962.26s]  every single time from like an app or a website i i haven't called a place to order since like
[10965.98s -> 10971.82s]  the 2001 or something i don't but here's the thing about ordering sometimes through those apps
[10972.78s -> 10977.42s]  it can get weird because sometimes get weird because sometimes it's just it's listed fucking
[10977.42s -> 10984.54s]  weirdly and it's like wait that's not that's listed kind of not correctly like it's like wait a minute
[10984.54s -> 10990.54s]  i have to check like five boxes but wait that's not how the thing's listed on the actual restaurant
[10990.54s -> 11000.01s]  it can be weird i i feel like i i i know exactly what i'm getting when i call they can be listed
[11000.01s -> 11004.01s]  bizarrely sometimes you don't even know what meat is in a sandwich for instance just like oh this
[11004.01s -> 11010.09s]  one's like a number three it's like wait what is that what's in it i don't know i need to i need
[11010.09s -> 11019.91s]  to know i need to find out what's in the number three can't you read oh yeah yeah are you gonna
[11019.91s -> 11034.52s]  make an offering yeah giving them 400 gold i actually gave it 250 and he gave me a broken jar
[11035.86s -> 11047.53s]  i got more help he gave me a useless a broken jar for 400 but no honestly though it a lot of
[11047.53s -> 11054.74s]  times i feel like i know exactly like oh so hey what what comes on that by the way oh this this
[11054.74s -> 11060.98s]  this and this okay good what i want uh i'm gonna take the l and just admit that one of my least
[11060.98s -> 11071.88s]  favorite things in life is being on the phone i actually don't mind it but i know what you mean
[11071.88s -> 11081.30s]  though like if i think i was saying not that long ago one of the greatest inventions ever
[11081.30s -> 11085.54s]  or like the greatest modern trends is that everything that you can order food is like
[11085.54s -> 11090.10s]  done through an app and you don't have to talk to someone like i'd give up so much technology
[11091.06s -> 11094.42s]  to never have to talk on the phone about the food i want you should eat this
[11098.86s -> 11104.22s]  i mean you're talking about convenience it's much more convenient for you to not have to do that
[11104.22s -> 11113.85s]  right i get it i feel the same way a lot of times right but i uh i have also used those apps before
[11114.65s -> 11121.21s]  and no fault of of the restaurant or even like the driver doesn't matter right no fault of anybody
[11121.21s -> 11128.33s]  it's just kind of wrong and you stuff doesn't come out right um i i much prefer being able to
[11128.33s -> 11132.81s]  know exactly like by somebody on the phone it's like telling me what i'm gonna be it's a it's
[11132.81s -> 11138.49s]  trust issues it's a trust issue here that you have focus up this is wait is this the guy

[11456.01s -> 11470.34s]  couldn't even fucking hurt him man he still didn't beat my damage no because you picked up almost
[11470.34s -> 11478.15s]  every single damage gem in the game that sounds true that sounds totally true and definitely a
[11478.15s -> 11481.51s]  way to like get yourself out of this but now you're not forgiven for all of your sins
[11482.55s -> 11493.13s]  when you die god's gonna look upon your record look at this moment but i tried that's the part

[11638.36s -> 11646.41s]  i did so all of the attacks can be charged so you can go one two one two three
[11647.05s -> 11655.48s]  again they're all they're all different seems strong i'll try both i think bow looks bad but
[11655.48s -> 11662.60s]  i'm gonna use it i'm gonna i'm gonna be the bow guy i actually probably should use this okay so
[11663.16s -> 11674.55s]  okay like if i'm very realistic i probably should use this okay let's go then i'm hammer guy

[11787.34s -> 11795.93s]  i don't like the bow it takes a lot are you using keyboard and mouse right so that probably would be
[11795.93s -> 11801.69s]  better for you it's it's helpful but i don't like the standing still hammer seems amazing by the
[11801.69s -> 11810.04s]  way it did seem that way wait what do we got frost wall or arcane bolts i'll take bolts
[11811.88s -> 11820.20s]  i like this one okay now i have two things i don't like god you want to start over me again
[11820.20s -> 11835.91s]  no i want to overcome yeah standing still tends to get you shot it's kind of rough
[11836.47s -> 11843.30s]  skills refresh quicker i'll take burn i haven't done burn you did burn it's pretty good
[11844.90s -> 11856.97s]  i guess i'll take it money or ember it's always money man that's what it's all about
[11857.69s -> 11861.69s]  how come that one chatter got a roblox birthday but i haven't gotten a minecraft party

[11897.86s -> 11903.62s]  me frost burn when were the sweepstakes it was me looking over and reading a name and deciding
[11903.62s -> 11923.48s]  that i was gonna do the thing uh that one moment that was so brave of you that's a good move
[11923.48s -> 11938.41s]  by the way you're healing is increased your skills have an additional charge these are all amazing
[11939.05s -> 11952.07s]  the first perfect skill man that's 25 more damage for five seconds for the i mean that that is it
[11952.07s -> 11957.99s]  bad you're gonna you're gonna do a perfect skill so it's objectively bad because the only rooms
[11957.99s -> 11963.67s]  that matter are the boss rooms and then it's only damage one time in a boss room well i mean look
[11963.67s -> 11976.39s]  at this thing right here that's perfect for me love that for me works for my build so you're
[11976.39s -> 11984.66s]  right this is kind of like uh hey the only thing that i haven't seen that much of is the leveling
[11984.66s -> 11991.90s]  up skills but i feel like it's in the game right uh i don't know i know there's like more stuff in
[11991.90s -> 11995.50s]  the hub we haven't unlocked for sure when does hades 2 come out of wherever it is

[12025.19s -> 12043.54s]  okay i do like about the bow that nothing attacks me and you you fight everything it is
[12043.54s -> 12063.27s]  it is kind of nice although it's kind of hard against bosses why very slow no no i'm talking
[12063.27s -> 12112.10s]  about the hammer it's kind of slow charge it up pal that does help whoa nice work there
[12115.72s -> 12133.53s]  thanks you need more max health do i do it gain five armor i feel like i did that a lot

[12301.48s -> 12310.65s]  life you ever just like order something on an app and then like it comes raw and you're like man if

[12439.29s -> 12463.66s]  never played angry bird congrats on the mvp oof sturm i'm sorry it's just some people haven't
[12463.66s -> 12468.86s]  experienced everything in the whole world there's some things that some people just don't have
[12468.86s -> 12476.41s]  experiences with and angry birds sorry is one of them for me i didn't see the movie i know
[12476.41s -> 12482.49s]  that it's a critically acclaimed masterpiece but i i just i just missed out on it you know
[12494.20s -> 12507.98s]  quick there's no way we don't beat that boss now i feel weak whenever you defeat an enemy refresh
[12507.98s -> 12521.30s]  a skill that seems unbelievable it does uh yeah uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm just gonna let you
[12521.30s -> 12525.14s]  kill everything i'll stand in the back and then we're gonna get to the boss and you're gonna have
[12525.14s -> 12546.14s]  700 weapon damage better you got him pal right there buddy just bop me i can't just bop me up
[12546.14s -> 12575.67s]  just bop me bop me give me a little boppy look out for the magicians i'm aware oh boppy you know

[12639.78s -> 12644.74s]  got it we gotta have you look how you look like the hulk it feels appropriate that you have more
[12644.74s -> 12649.14s]  health than me because i'm like hawkeye and you're the hulk yeah but the same shit's gonna happen
[12649.14s -> 12659.02s]  when i was the last one to fight the boss and i had no damage increase that was all my fault
[12659.02s -> 12666.86s]  i shouldn't have died i got hit by like everything you know what i mean like i just made a couple
[12666.86s -> 12672.81s]  crucial mistakes i won't let it happen again we got one of those things
[12673.29s -> 12681.40s]  so that makes me happy i'll learn i'll evolve i'll be better i'll do better
[12694.15s -> 12709.98s]  hammer is good hammer is good you'd like the hammer i believe you look at my last message
[12709.98s -> 12722.28s]  to see the curse i placed on you um money i don't think we need money do you really you want the
[12722.28s -> 12744.33s]  meta yeah we both have over 350 gold some things cost like 300 what does that stuff what does the
[12744.33s -> 12748.87s]  ember do uh that's when we go back to town at the end of the run and upgrade our character
[12750.09s -> 12778.86s]  oh okay you want stats or skills i want a skill i i hate my current skills i hate that i have
[12778.86s -> 12792.60s]  to kill these witches to get it though really start to settle into this character arcane bolts
[12792.60s -> 12799.24s]  is just so good i again i don't like either of these did you get the ability to reroll
[12799.24s -> 12808.95s]  it's part of the ember i didn't can i drop stuff i can reroll something for you did not maybe um
[12809.75s -> 12834.28s]  i don't think you can drop skills um i think i i used the dice i didn't like it very much
[12834.28s -> 12838.92s]  it took like it like you throw it and then it charges up by the time it charges up the
[12838.92s -> 12847.19s]  thing was dead just skip stick chakram dude chakram was good unless you like what you have is good
[12847.83s -> 12856.14s]  the burn thing is really good though i'm gonna keep what i have all right uh
[12856.70s -> 12862.94s]  uh hey i need a little bit of damage feel a little weird like somebody just took that
[12862.94s -> 12870.28s]  item do you need me do you want me to help i'm kidding or am i i don't think you are
[12871.48s -> 12878.62s]  there's no possible way that everything you say is a joke all right like some things you say have
[12878.62s -> 12888.81s]  to be real and true at some point yeah that's true you ready you ready is it a double again
[12888.81s -> 12925.03s]  or just one oh i know this guy he's summoning boys like little snowballs we just destroyed
[12925.03s -> 12936.47s]  that guy yeah i feel like he was alive for a very short amount of time i'll get that meat i want to
[12936.47s -> 12955.08s]  i want to see you eat it come on come on big boy come on big boy nice uh thanks for your continued
[12955.08s -> 12961.90s]  patronage and to maximize our profits to maximize our services you can now reroll items in the shop
[12964.46s -> 12979.02s]  here you might take that one yeah i don't like any of these i like this one how do you do the
[12979.02s -> 12988.82s]  reroll talk to him wait let me see it real quick oh the oh bro i got a broken jar that i paid
[12988.82s -> 12996.65s]  400 dollars for before secret number nine good as new wow it's not worth much to me now that it's
[12996.65s -> 13002.65s]  empty your first skill using each room grants shield for five seconds that stops projectiles
[13002.65s -> 13010.33s]  and prevents damage to all nights inside of it i would say that's really good but it only happens
[13010.33s -> 13022.23s]  once yeah i don't know it's kind of like prevent damage won't you know that's all right uh i think
[13022.23s -> 13028.89s]  you should take impact charm that sounds like a hammer would do good with that does the hammer
[13028.89s -> 13037.70s]  stuns but i mean i guess i wonder what part of the combo is uh is this what you already had every
[13037.70s -> 13050.44s]  four enemies you defeat that thing's pretty good is the um is the stun the second or the i think
[13050.44s -> 13057.90s]  it's the third swing actually hammer applies slow not stun is it's everything applies stun it's like
[13057.90s -> 13063.03s]  everyone has like a stamina bar and if you get the opportunity to get the the shield charge that
[13063.03s -> 13079.98s]  always stuns we said come over andy let me make that actually what it is oh you missed you missed
[13081.02s -> 13093.82s]  silence oh so holly and i were um we watched uh we watched the hunchback of notredame
[13094.86s -> 13101.58s]  and the villain in the hunchback of notredame got us to really think about something if at any point
[13102.46s -> 13114.42s]  you ever utter the words silence you're you're evil right or enough silence that's the only you
[13114.42s -> 13120.02s]  aren't you're evil nobody has ever uttered that word that followed up with being good
[13121.05s -> 13127.03s]  i yeah i'm trying to think of examples uh go against that i i can't think of anything i i
[13127.03s -> 13135.94s]  don't think there is a single example silence unless you're like a kindergarten teacher maybe
[13135.94s -> 13157.08s]  maybe i'm really thinking of outliers what about gandalf gandalf says silence that he goes
[13157.08s -> 13170.36s]  silence silence dumbledore says silence yeah yeah gandalf is evil no he's not like teachers i feel
[13170.36s -> 13190.26s]  like our teachers and parents are the exception here silent gandalf gandalf is basically a parent
[13190.26s -> 13197.54s]  oh no no another thing too if anyone ever says i will see to this insolence insolence is another
[13197.54s -> 13209.86s]  one as well true but villains getting typecast out there they all say the same thing silence
[13210.50s -> 13216.10s]  i have had enough of this insolence that means this guy's fucked up and is doing awful shit
[13216.66s -> 13226.65s]  terrible things yeah well no foolish is i don't think foolish is there
[13231.75s -> 13241.29s]  insolent fools yeah actually maybe if you're right that is bad guy speak isn't it all right such
[13241.29s -> 13252.04s]  arrogance you're saying a lot of you're saying a lot of evil guy stuff at the moment i'm thinking
[13252.76s -> 13272.06s]  oh shit i was frozen i didn't know wake up wake up somebody said finally
[13273.50s -> 13279.99s]  i don't think it's finally i think it's at long last means the same thing but one of them is
[13279.99s -> 13287.00s]  inherently more evil me and you were both the same you're just like me yep that's another one
[13287.96s -> 13299.86s]  good that's a good one like you and i are the same i'll never be you i'll never be just like you
[13299.86s -> 13312.38s]  right yeah that happens a lot they do exist why is that funny right now
[13317.22s -> 13321.22s]  you letting that guy hit you i kind of was i've got too busy thinking of other things
[13322.02s -> 13333.35s]  it's doing like ad libs what would a villain say all right stir yeah i'm gonna say what
[13333.35s -> 13349.26s]  is this from they do exist what it was a good try i have no idea i have no idea what is it
[13349.26s -> 13359.24s]  that is santa from the 1998 television commercial the m&m's meet santa you're right i remember
[13360.12s -> 13369.69s]  yeah you got you got me oh eat up eat up big boy let's fucking go are you ready yeah i'm ready
[13369.69s -> 13375.90s]  this is it right here i'm ready to annihilate this boss within like five seconds we're gonna
[13375.90s -> 13412.79s]  one phase him oh all right hold on my underwear is like glued to my ass right now oh come on
[13412.79s -> 13422.94s]  that was unfair just roll just roll
[13430.76s -> 13464.31s]  that was unfair that's unfair dude isn't it though the only way something could ever
[13465.03s -> 13484.89s]  penetrate my defenses was with some cheap tactic get up late oh that got deleted
[13488.38s -> 13493.72s]  did you love it when you the streamer read the comments i got delete it yeah like oh i wasn't
[13493.72s -> 13503.86s]  supposed to encourage that or something i feel like i do that a lot why are moderators removing
[13503.86s -> 13511.22s]  comments because they break the rules what are the rules you're afraid of like someone saying
[13511.22s -> 13521.64s]  something censorship i feel like i've seen people say like you're dumb and that doesn't get deleted
[13521.64s -> 13528.86s]  but what gets deleted is play five nights at freddy's you're gonna get mvp every time one
[13528.86s -> 13536.10s]  of them is an opinion the other one is a demand i think you should play five nights at freddy's
[13536.10s -> 13542.87s]  that's fine get rid of him that's an opinion well okay but that's i think you should play not
[13542.87s -> 13549.03s]  you need to play exactly okay but you said get rid of me there was still like a knee jerk get rid of
[13549.03s -> 13571.06s]  me silence you insolent cur cur is another one you vile fiend i kissed my ring they gotta do a
[13571.06s -> 13583.75s]  character that does all that says all that but it turns out he's not the bad guy hey my curse
[13583.75s -> 13595.46s]  takes effect this boss fight but there's a curse insulin oh another one is well are you insolent
[13595.46s -> 13612.98s]  well you sussy baka also yeah that's also used a lot oh that's good see that's whenever you use
[13612.98s -> 13629.19s]  a skill gain bonus damage not like once per room i'm not about this once per room can you sing
[13629.19s -> 13633.35s]  happy birthday for my daughter
[13642.70s -> 13646.46s]  it was singing he was singing down here did you know that me me and ashley we have a rule when
[13646.46s -> 13651.10s]  we're watching tv like it's a i think i've maybe even said this before maybe i'm a broken record
[13651.10s -> 13657.14s]  where if someone in a show starts singing we skip you know you like just press forward like once
[13657.14s -> 13661.70s]  so it goes like 10 seconds forward if they're still singing you press it again just get get to
[13661.70s -> 13667.48s]  the end of it i kind of feel you the only way i think that that does not make sense if it's a
[13667.48s -> 13677.37s]  musical yeah well then you're you're obviously want every song like three words where they set
[13677.37s -> 13683.93s]  up the next song like oh yeah like oh and then just yeah it's like next next and here comes it
[13683.93s -> 13692.86s]  now now get rid of this hey uh you want to watch the musical but i i kind of don't want to
[13693.82s -> 13697.34s]  i don't like when people sing you mind i don't like songs
[13699.75s -> 13704.07s]  they want it you know my favorite fast time is i've talked about this a lot but i
[13704.07s -> 13712.71s]  i haven't i have ever talked about it with you uh the whole like hentai thing you pick a movie
[13713.35s -> 13720.79s]  and you watch only like two minutes of the movie and then you go forward how am i supposed to even
[13720.79s -> 13728.07s]  fucking talk after that one you take you take a movie and you watch 10 minutes and then you
[13728.07s -> 13735.67s]  skip like 30 minutes and then watch two minutes have you actually done this it's fucking fun as
[13735.67s -> 13744.90s]  hell why why because you can watch any shitty movie you want and it's only like 16 minutes of
[13744.90s -> 13752.18s]  commitment but you gain nothing no you get the whole movie trust me watch five minutes in the
[13752.18s -> 13760.42s]  beginning skip 20 minutes watch 10 minutes skip 25 minutes watch three minutes skip to the end
[13760.42s -> 13770.70s]  of the movie it's so fun it's so fun trust me i i feel like i might have done that at some point
[13771.34s -> 13775.74s]  it's not like intentionally so deliberate in it but like there's a couple shows where it's like i
[13775.74s -> 13781.18s]  i really need to know how this ends but i'm actually so sick of it and think it's bad you
[13781.26s -> 13788.23s]  just watch like five minutes of every episode oh my god i did that with lucifer i don't know
[13789.19s -> 13795.51s]  lucifer the fucking wait wait wait can we talk about it we had we have to talk about this in
[13795.51s -> 13802.07s]  detail can we yeah okay let's make a very very important point here this is going to be massive
[13802.07s -> 13807.88s]  spoilers for this show let's show lucifer right yeah yeah so this is big spoilers for lucifer
[13807.88s -> 13813.29s]  huge huge massive i want to i want you to talk because i want to see if you and i did the exact
[13813.29s -> 13820.46s]  same thing i enjoyed it for a bit and then i kind of got the formula and thought every episode was
[13820.46s -> 13826.78s]  boring but there's like five minutes of interesting content every episode so i would skip to the middle
[13826.78s -> 13831.96s]  watch two minutes skip to the very end of the episode watch two minutes next episode yeah i
[13831.96s -> 13840.76s]  was a little more egregious um but yes that is exactly what i'm talking about doing i okay this
[13840.76s -> 13845.08s]  is a huge spoiler so massive lucifer spoilers i'm serious i'm gonna write it on the screen
[13847.48s -> 13854.30s]  so i how many episodes are in the first season of lucifer i i i mean who i don't know let's say
[13854.30s -> 13860.60s]  it's like let's assume 10 let's just say it's 10 i hold on actually i feel like it's one of those
[13860.60s -> 13868.10s]  shows that has like 20 episode seasons but the first one might have been like seven i think it
[13868.10s -> 13875.88s]  was more like a season one pilot kind of thing you're looking it up right now no i'm just i'm
[13875.88s -> 13882.81s]  writing that is we're talking about spoilers okay so um i didn't really care about this show at all
[13882.81s -> 13890.39s]  i just saw the thumbnail of the show and it was just him like as lucifer right he's he looks like
[13890.39s -> 13896.46s]  the devil um i opened up episode one and i scrolled through to find when he becomes that like satan
[13896.46s -> 13902.58s]  character it doesn't happen i i went through every single episode scrolling through until he
[13904.58s -> 13910.18s]  first episode no no he doesn't no he doesn't he does no he doesn't he doesn't like at the very end
[13910.18s -> 13920.36s]  of the whole show no i mean no you're saying it's a spoiler that the show named lucifer
[13920.36s -> 13926.18s]  the guy turns into the devil yeah but he doesn't do it until like the one of the last episodes of
[13926.18s -> 13937.11s]  this first season i i think at the end he finally no no i'm telling you i'm telling you no he doesn't
[13937.11s -> 13946.04s]  in episode one he absolutely doesn't in the trailer yes in the like episode one he starts
[13946.04s -> 13951.88s]  by like tormenting some guy then he's like i'm the devil like fucking 10 minutes in he does so my
[13951.88s -> 13959.40s]  skip strategy was was had holes in it it's like a big reveal that other people realize he's that's
[13959.40s -> 13965.85s]  like way further on but i don't think he like shows himself as the devil to like a that's what
[13965.85s -> 13973.90s]  i'm saying it's really not what you're saying it's really not he doesn't like turn into like i'm satan
[13974.06s -> 13978.70s]  i am like i'm like horns and i'm like okay i'm like we're in spoiler mode the show gets so
[13978.70s -> 13983.26s]  fucking weird where he finally reveals after like three seasons to the detective he's working with
[13983.26s -> 13987.98s]  and he's like kind of in love with like hey i'm actually satan and she's like ah i don't know how
[13987.98s -> 13994.76s]  to cope with that and they have this like weird on and off like i have been partners with satan
[13994.76s -> 14000.76s]  for like the last couple years of my life and it's weird where she's like trying to come to terms
[14000.76s -> 14005.67s]  with like him being literal satan but we're talking about the okay let me make sure i got
[14005.67s -> 14014.58s]  the right show in the thumbnail he's like this like right like okay well netflix changes the
[14014.58s -> 14025.78s]  thumbnails a lot it's not always one thumbnail but i imagine yes that right there and he's like
[14025.78s -> 14033.32s]  and he's satan he is satan he does solve crime as satan wait hold on a minute this is now that's
[14033.32s -> 14037.80s]  a series of unfortunate events that's count all off right it's a different show hold on wait
[14038.76s -> 14046.87s]  this is the same thumbnail they used to stand the same exact thumbnail for both shows
[14046.87s -> 14051.42s]  that use they use that a lot but my point still stands he doesn't reveal that he's satan
[14051.42s -> 14057.66s]  until like the last episode no your your point was no spoilers did you know the main guy in lucifer
[14057.66s -> 14062.06s]  is lucifer no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying he doesn't like reveal that he's lucifer
[14062.06s -> 14070.22s]  until like the last episode of the first season no my chat's reminding me that like he has like
[14070.22s -> 14074.54s]  a devil face and he even he even calls it like devil face like a fucking preschooler
[14076.15s -> 14084.62s]  and he doesn't do like devil face to someone for a bit but he's like very obviously satan
[14085.86s -> 14090.98s]  yeah but he doesn't he doesn't have the like he doesn't have that look until like the last
[14090.98s -> 14097.99s]  episode of the first season you might be right about that i'm telling you i i i'm gonna i think
[14097.99s -> 14105.27s]  i'm correct but it's not like they're hiding it no you know it's obviously that guy is lucifer
[14105.27s -> 14109.43s]  i'm just saying they don't do like that thumbnail face until one of the last episodes of the first
[14109.43s -> 14115.96s]  season okay and you you skipped every episode to find the face i just wanted to see a scene of him
[14115.96s -> 14120.82s]  being like oh yes it's me satan i just wanted to find it and i couldn't find it took me to the last
[14120.82s -> 14130.62s]  episode okay you didn't watch it no i didn't i'm telling you i scrubbed through every episode just
[14130.62s -> 14139.03s]  to find the one time but he did it was it worth it he does it every single episode i gotta go back
[14139.03s -> 14144.63s]  and do some he really does we're like he he ends up trying to catch the person before his detective
[14144.63s -> 14148.87s]  buddy does and then he goes devil mode on him to be like you shouldn't have done that by the way
[14148.87s -> 14156.73s]  i'm satan and then he like does some satan stuff in the first episode he definitely it has to be
[14156.73s -> 14169.45s]  in the first episode man he does it every episode yeah that's that's how i'm remembering it
[14170.41s -> 14180.14s]  though i do think like i don't know season one probably has some like melodramatic reveal of
[14180.14s -> 14185.82s]  like his real true satan self i i need to go i'm gonna have to do some homework tonight
[14187.98s -> 14197.38s]  yeah eat this meat buddy hmm chomp on that i want both these gems you take one

[15182.73s -> 15189.29s]  ring uh indoor facility bathroom would you um i'd like to use the most and order it by least
[15189.29s -> 15195.21s]  to most favorite i i want to go to the top of that one spire the giant like tree spire that you know
[15195.21s -> 15218.14s]  you like climb down in the middle of and shit all the way down at the hallock tree um you should
[15218.14s -> 15224.01s]  take this i don't think it was a halogen tree it was just the giant spire
[15228.81s -> 15243.70s]  so which elden ring castle are you okay so oh it's the boss man it's what's the main guy he's not the
[15243.70s -> 15249.46s]  boss but he's saying that things are he doesn't like us and that he's gonna win and he's doing
[15249.46s -> 15256.02s]  the anime akuma turn his back and look at us with the eye flash uh he's saying that we're not useless
[15256.02s -> 15265.18s]  but we are or something he's laughing that's a good one i like that one you really think you
[15265.18s -> 15292.22s]  can stop me then deal with this draws a card from his yu-gi-oh deck oh no it's impossible
[15292.94s -> 15298.86s]  how could they have ever known to hit the crystals that were connecting the robots to the shields
[15298.86s -> 15304.22s]  oh it only takes no way it takes two hits oh how could they have figured that out in time
[15306.63s -> 15315.08s]  two hits really my my damage is not good evil villain tropes are so funny
[15315.80s -> 15322.92s]  she's like and they'll never get away from this i love i loved in diablo 3 when asmodan would
[15322.92s -> 15328.04s]  fucking monologue you every level actual chrono trigger joke yeah that is it is a chrono trigger
[15328.04s -> 15344.54s]  joke have you played chrono trigger no can i pay you to play it i imagine there's a price
[15345.42s -> 15368.04s]  damn it how long is it um it's pretty long it's a solid at least it's at least 20 30 hours at
[15368.04s -> 15390.97s]  least i'd say probably somewhere around 40 you want to do everything i'm saying 20 20 yeah when
[15390.97s -> 15396.98s]  you uh when you beat jade cocoon i'll play it no that's kind of unfair though because
[15397.06s -> 15403.14s]  chrono trigger has had five re-releases on a bunch of different platforms i i i either have to
[15403.14s -> 15408.82s]  emulate this game or i have to buy it randomly from some well you just said you would pay me
[15408.82s -> 15414.34s]  to play chrono trigger and my price is you playing jade cocoon okay i've named my price
[15415.30s -> 15428.02s]  that's just the way it's gonna be if you're you're sitting there like you know like chrono
[15428.02s -> 15432.74s]  trigger is one of the greatest games of all time he hasn't played like chrono he has dude someone
[15432.74s -> 15439.40s]  else besides me has to have played jade cocoon no every time i bring it up everyone's like what
[15439.40s -> 15459.22s]  what's that i've heard it was really good i've heard it was so sick of it oh this is a
[15461.59s -> 15475.27s]  ribbit ribbit frog oh my god why can't we be friends with him i know like he only wasn't just
[15475.27s -> 15492.86s]  such an insolent well damn it maybe we could have oh how much damage are your hits doing
[15492.86s -> 15508.41s]  uh that one did 91 okay 40 to 50 on average my fully charged arrows is like 40 if i get a
[15508.41s -> 15531.43s]  credit that's about 100 and my my non-charged ones are like 20 oh god that was a lot go find
[15532.15s -> 15538.55s]  the nephilim you're referencing things that i don't know about that's not fair that's not fair

[16039.88s -> 16047.69s]  roguelike i i think this whole run would have been better if i didn't use the bow like if we both
[16047.69s -> 16053.61s]  actually did hammer yeah but we could be getting roguelike because i mean i don't think so you
[16053.61s -> 16070.97s]  don't think so this is this is tricky this is hard my camera is being really weird i mean it's
[16070.97s -> 16084.74s]  gonna be very i have faith in you i truly do those ads are a killer though i mean this would be top
[16084.74s -> 16104.49s]  gamer moment of the year if you could pull this up if i wouldn't it's because of the shield dash
[16142.18s -> 16152.18s]  nice damn gamer gamer gamer gamer nice we were supposed to get roguelike there but you didn't

[16160.95s -> 16175.96s]  greats i'm surprised that there's more uh yeah maybe maybe not i think that was the last one
[16176.60s -> 16186.30s]  oh yeah i'm glad you did that because you got to the end i mean i think this is uh the final
[16186.30s -> 16198.62s]  there would be one more area in 1.0 is what i think is how it's going to be congratulations
[16198.62s -> 16205.35s]  don't let your guard down as there's plenty of new content coming yeah i hope you're the mvp
[16205.35s -> 16212.01s]  i think like if you still are and you probably still did more damage than me yep highly possible
[16212.01s -> 16222.33s]  congrats dude you fucking earned it thanks you got a few of those
[16228.47s -> 16242.26s]  i i thought i would at least get rolled the most cool oh this is good this i heavily enjoyed this
[16242.26s -> 16254.42s]  game that was really fun yeah i want to see what was up with the raptor guy it's very very fun i
[16254.42s -> 16265.86s]  wonder when 1.0 comes out did get the final weapon this guy come over up the dino guy
[16266.58s -> 16272.65s]  come up to the dine come up to the dinosaur but we have to identify items we have to talk to dad
[16273.45s -> 16286.10s]  we have things to identify that first one seems great yep all right let's talk to the dino
[16289.99s -> 16294.07s]  this old thing has seen better days hasn't it huh he's gonna fix it oh he's gonna fix it look at
[16294.07s -> 16299.27s]  this look at this look at this look at this look at him fixing it look at it look at that if you
[16299.27s -> 16306.62s]  shit your pants during five minutes as far as you have to tell us okay i wouldn't hide it no
[16306.62s -> 16318.86s]  hiding it either uh we want to know skill convergence and creation device that lets you
[16318.86s -> 16324.14s]  break down skill tablets into their most basic parts like miniscule i mean so small you can't
[16324.14s -> 16330.95s]  even see them dude then it transmute demographize them into new skills so you can wait can you make
[16331.83s -> 16343.50s]  a new mechanic what do we got uh anyway we can convert the skill tablets you find into new
[16343.50s -> 16348.38s]  skills pretty great huh if you find any more be sure to bring them back to me what's the skill
[16348.38s -> 16357.18s]  tablet acquire skill i guess we could never find them before because we never did we didn't have
[16357.18s -> 16370.36s]  him yet oh okay what's the what's the last weapon razor wind there's also another weapon
[16371.08s -> 16377.24s]  oh this is such a this is a stir weapon this is such a stir weapon spectral throw is one
[16377.24s -> 16385.69s]  of my favorite skills you're not wrong actually it's good but it takes a long time to load up a
[16385.69s -> 16392.65s]  perfect yeah but it still has like a quick attack just like the sword does sword doesn't have a
[16392.65s -> 16400.58s]  charge thing right the thing with the sword is has the dash move does the dash attack so you can
[16400.58s -> 16406.66s]  kind of just get it and get up whenever you hit an enemy with your charge attack your chain attacks
[16406.66s -> 16411.30s]  become empowered and deal bonus damage i don't know what chain attack is maybe the lightning
[16411.30s -> 16423.06s]  chains yeah okay i wonder what the last uh there's one more weapon that's not here yet
[16425.86s -> 16432.82s]  truly who knows all right well are you ready to play five nights at freddy's which one should
[16432.82s -> 16442.01s]  he play should you play one or two hey i got them both stirred remember when you said uh uh
[16442.01s -> 16446.25s]  what was it about how you were just gonna be the entertainment on the stream
[16446.73s -> 16455.37s]  uh yeah well hey everybody we're gonna raid stir i'm gonna stay in the call and we're gonna watch
[16455.37s -> 16462.58s]  him play so you what you said was accurate yeah so we figured that would be the best way to do
[16462.58s -> 16467.54s]  it because otherwise it's hard with like stream delays for him to even actually watch yeah so i'm
[16467.54s -> 16472.10s]  just gonna stay in the call i'm gonna raid him and we're gonna watch five nights at freddy's i'm
[16472.10s -> 16479.06s]  gonna be in the call people saying play both let's get a poll all in your chat all in my chat
[16479.70s -> 16485.61s]  could he do one or two because i'm just gonna let's be realistic stir be realistic too you're
[16485.61s -> 16492.10s]  probably gonna play this for like 30 minutes and uninstall both of them i you said beating the game
[16492.10s -> 16500.50s]  was like two hours give or take then if two is the better one maybe we should just do two let's see
[16500.50s -> 16505.46s]  because i feel like if it took that long to like legitimately beat one and move on to two i would
[16505.46s -> 16511.85s]  not want to play too at that point one is way more beginner friendly i'm not a beginner yeah but
[16511.85s -> 16516.97s]  this is a bunch of weird shit the balloon boy and you gotta put a mask on when they come into the
[16516.97s -> 16525.74s]  room and stuff i think i don't know we'll see what does your chat say uh i didn't make a poll
[16526.55s -> 16532.20s]  and there's like one guy that said please play too okay so do you want to go by the one guy in
[16532.20s -> 16536.54s]  your chat or do you want to go by what what's going on over here like you you'll be here to
[16536.54s -> 16540.78s]  tell me like what i need to do with the mass you should definitely you should definitely just okay
[16540.78s -> 16546.86s]  do start with one and then play like a quick one and then jump into two yeah like get get familiar
[16546.86s -> 16550.87s]  with one and then you'll understand too and then we can just jump right into two after like all
[16550.87s -> 16559.16s]  right let's let's get it champ okay uh so hold on let me make sure this is going well all right
