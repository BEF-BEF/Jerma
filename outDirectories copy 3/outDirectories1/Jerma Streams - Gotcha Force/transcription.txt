[102.18s -> 108.90s]  played and what I mean by that is this game was 250 dollars it's the most expensive game I think

[278.34s -> 283.30s]  and this is a rare game and everyone was like holy shit this game's so good this game was so
[283.30s -> 289.94s]  good that they've remade it they've re-released it for gamecube like recently I think like within

[8750.12s -> 8760.22s]  negative well hold on to be fair there was a point in the stream where everyone was just doing it
[8760.22s -> 8765.26s]  to make sure that it was going to be down they like they were doing it on purpose like five
[8765.26s -> 8779.08s]  straight minutes germa is oil stock germa is oil stock germa is oil stock omega low
[8780.04s -> 8809.11s]  wow robot check it out it's high like high attack quaternary missile iron claw iron spin
[8810.07s -> 8816.28s]  a robot type got you board who was created to defend cities protect citizens from invaders
[8816.28s -> 8826.70s]  with his hard metal claws and quaternary missile attacks where do you buy germa stocks you don't
[8826.70s -> 8856.39s]  you only sell them god i don't think i've ever seen anybody buy let's try claw born with germa
[8856.39s -> 8880.04s]  stocks all right i gotta get the team together how many outstanding how many germa stocks exist
[8880.04s -> 8896.02s]  in the world five thousand that's just the number of people that are here that's the first number i
[8896.02s -> 8905.74s]  thought up because i saw that's the first number i looked at holy shit he shoots missiles oh that's
[8905.74s -> 8913.61s]  cool all right let's get in by getting close that's a good escape how did what's his movement like
[8913.61s -> 8922.39s]  anyway it's not bad what the hell is with that camera angle i'm assuming his melee damage is
[8922.39s -> 8956.57s]  better than anything else yes it is it's low though can drop below 400 what well that's just
[8956.57s -> 8966.86s]  manipulation though it's not real follow the fucking germa exchange commission on you guys
[8966.86s -> 8988.50s]  by the way it's me they're all going to jail jex germa exchange commission missiles are all right
[8988.50s -> 9000.25s]  they're kind of boring though i mean i guess if you can spam them like this it works out pretty well
[9001.21s -> 9030.86s]  brush teeth quick the joke tracker wait are you guys let me see this shit what's going on here
[9031.42s -> 9061.26s]  you guys causing a problem oh you guys know that it was a point when i was thinking about having
[9061.26s -> 9068.50s]  an extension made for this channel keep the plus two and minus two out of the chat let's talk about
[9068.50s -> 9083.69s]  this holy shit i just get destroyed and have it be something you could do but you couldn't just
[9083.69s -> 9090.09s]  like spam it i mean it was like it would be like actually like it would be like an indicator
[9090.81s -> 9096.18s]  and every once in a while we would just check on and see how it was but the reason why i didn't
[9096.18s -> 9103.37s]  do it and this is the reason why i probably won't do it it's because um i don't we make
[9103.37s -> 9110.09s]  jokes about like oh minus two and plus two that's like just i don't know if i want to have a like how
[9111.05s -> 9117.45s]  bad is your stream today how not funny were you today oh no today was good but this one oh this
[9117.45s -> 9122.33s]  is a real time indicator this stream is i don't think this this stream sucks i don't think i want
[9122.33s -> 9128.28s]  that information i don't think i would want that because then it would just get in my head
[9129.00s -> 9131.72s]  and every day would just be like let me check that joke indicator and see
[9132.60s -> 9136.92s]  well what do we have plus no no i can do better than that i can do better than that and then i
[9137.00s -> 9141.56s]  have to start trying to like make jokes as hard as i can and then that's going to make it worse
[9142.12s -> 9165.30s]  we just got a spinner girl okay yeah i gotta play with hatchet night best game on the game cube
[9170.22s -> 9181.66s]  very expensive though let's see we got we got three jumps you see that's better than we have

[9275.90s -> 9289.85s]  incredible that's i i don't think that's a debate that's a really weird debate in my opinion

[9400.49s -> 9411.66s]  the nice thing you went the right way and throw the act oh you have to charge it to throw it
[9412.22s -> 9428.98s]  how far does it go that's pretty far actually but it stays out his speed is so bad though
[9435.38s -> 9446.30s]  melee is good in this game but not really i'll be honest you gotta get in close people can move
[9446.30s -> 9475.85s]  around so far i think this guy's too expensive for how kind of shitty he is i mean it's it stays
[9475.85s -> 9479.77s]  out okay that's good that's the one decent thing is it actually keeps spinning around
[9480.41s -> 9496.87s]  really ask our gotcha force expert if they're any good i'm sure they probably were unbeatable
[9496.87s -> 9510.92s]  at one point good for big groups it's a long time to charge yeah it's all right can we turn
[9510.92s -> 9525.53s]  the right way please all right let's see what's see speed uh speed drill oh that's super short

[13005.74s -> 13011.96s]  mistake them for gum they're that chewy to a point where they they bunch up and it's like
[13015.27s -> 13019.27s]  and you think if you bite if you pull your teeth up too hard you're gonna rip all your molars up
[13019.27s -> 13037.54s]  that's how chewy i want them and you just you put a little bit of milk in your mouth so it makes it
[13037.54s -> 13045.62s]  a little softer but still you gotta like i want my jaw to hurt from how hard i have to work to chew

[13145.51s -> 13152.55s]  for you until i got a little bit older she would be making cookies and i would just go over there
[13153.11s -> 13159.51s]  and just the beater would be there and i would just go in there with like a spoon and eat like
[13159.51s -> 13163.59s]  three or four mounds worth of the cookie dough that was in the thing that she was making
[13166.07s -> 13172.60s]  and i years later i found out that you know that's it's not good as bad for you it's actually not

[15053.76s -> 15071.91s]  I feel kind of bad for you right in the back. You're the space marine
[15072.43s -> 15085.02s]  Could be what can I do with the first character?
[15085.94s -> 15098.11s]  Probably not he's got a dodge. You got a dodge, right? I didn't I didn't I fucked it up
[15098.55s -> 15124.37s]  And I could activate this but why I bother why is everybody something that ten years old?
[15124.37s -> 15126.37s]  I think they're supposed to be ten years old
[15126.61s -> 15137.63s]  All right, something good something worth putting in the team permanently
[15138.23s -> 15159.23s]  Permanent upgrade. All right, that's a normal night doesn't sound very exciting short range the
[15159.91s -> 15163.99s]  Broad sword cross-shape slash and then shield slash this gotcha board
[15164.63s -> 15170.35s]  His warrior in the night board corpse. He wields a broadsword and his shield repels any attack
[15171.07s -> 15179.25s]  I'll give it a try
[15180.13s -> 15193.18s]  I feel like my characters suck. I have where all the good unlock where all the good
[15194.70s -> 15196.70s]  Rng is giving me bad ones
[15198.42s -> 15206.10s]  Are the tornado? Oh, I will after this. I'm gonna try the shield guy
[15207.10s -> 15217.15s]  After this we're gonna do the losses
[15220.04s -> 15233.48s]  Let's go support
[15233.68s -> 15239.70s]  All right, so they can't hurt me from the front only. All right. Well, I don't have any moves
[15240.26s -> 15245.31s]  But you you can Captain America
[15251.33s -> 15260.75s]  I'm not gonna lie. I don't hate this character. I mean obviously versus enemies that are not on the ground
[15261.31s -> 15264.58s]  You can get a good slash on here and then you block everything from the front of you
[15265.22s -> 15266.46s]  like that
[15266.46s -> 15268.46s]  Yeah, look at this
[15268.58s -> 15284.38s]  Actually kind of good. I wish it wasn't normal night one. Of course, you like the reddit character
[15286.02s -> 15288.02s]  America's a reddit character now
[15288.18s -> 15291.56s]  May that heal heal
[15292.00s -> 15304.22s]  Yes, so what's a not reddit character? I'm sure it's not Deadpool a positive
[15304.74s -> 15329.29s]  There's that hurt anybody oh fuck it does you gotta be really close for it though
[15329.81s -> 15339.52s]  Just keep people in front of you. I'll tell you if I got a better version of this guy. I'm gonna I'm putting him in
[15340.20s -> 15352.75s]  Every superhero is reddit. That's not fair
[15353.23s -> 15359.63s]  No, but Wolverine that Wolverine's probably from reddit. Um
[15360.27s -> 15361.95s]  What about uh?
[15361.95s -> 15373.22s]  So what the hell is a superhero that what super hero my let me actually rephrase this question. What superhero am I allowed to like?
[15373.78s -> 15403.86s]  The Joker I'm allowed to like the Joker. What about um, what red and Stimpy?
[15404.38s -> 15421.58s]  Bane I can like Bane. That's at least that's good
[15427.54s -> 15431.98s]  Reddit Stimpy you guys hate this place
[15432.82s -> 15436.68s]  You guys fucking hate this place
[15451.43s -> 15468.50s]  Have I seen such powerful anger before let's check. Let's test this theory out. Okay, that's actually pretty great
[15468.62s -> 15477.27s]  You can instantly charge that I'm glad I took that person's advice two and a half hours later
[15477.87s -> 15498.62s]  What about um Hulk another battle girl got so many of these I don't know what to do with them
[15499.30s -> 15519.42s]  I'm gonna keep this team for now for now. I don't I like it
[15519.98s -> 15523.14s]  Try tornado girl and replace a shooter guy

[15535.67s -> 15548.75s]  Hulk used to be based but after endgame like after Infinity War and after like the Avengers saw yeah. Yeah

[15605.44s -> 15616.49s]  Whoa, that's a huge incapacitation
[15617.09s -> 15621.35s]  Holy shit. This is actually kind of good and then you go in
[15621.93s -> 15630.51s]  Well, I mean I wouldn't go in on their main hero. That was pretty dumb. That's pretty dumb. I'm out
[15630.87s -> 15644.69s]  It's kind of a support character. Well sort of working. I

[15878.42s -> 15891.35s]  Why do about this? Maybe this weirdo will be good here angel spam will shred health. That's true
[15897.98s -> 15901.89s]  Mmm, this isn't enough
[15905.73s -> 15916.22s]  Normal night. I got my ass kicked with normal night. I'm gonna put you down here. All right, let's try this

[16137.98s -> 16142.52s]  random slash soul ball and then demon knit poor Ryu
[16143.46s -> 16148.65s]  God report who rose from a samurai grave his bloodthirsty sword grows as it absorbs spirits
[16148.81s -> 16151.97s]  His special random slash move shows unbelievable power
[16152.49s -> 16165.99s]  This guy's fun. I can't even put him on here right now do this and then add
[16166.27s -> 16192.58s]  In Joe right say the game this is like bionicle, uh more so like I
[16193.14s -> 16197.24s]  Don't know what you would you compare this to?
[16197.52s -> 16206.88s]  But just it's the death for his base. Wait, what defeat the Dark Knight?
[16207.48s -> 16211.87s]  Beat the no, I'm already for wait. What about a dragon? There's a dragon here
[16212.71s -> 16218.18s]  Gravity trap battle the cosmic dragon. Who should I fight first?
[16218.94s -> 16239.73s]  By fight one would like cancel out the other like the dragon. Okay, I'm gonna get man. Oh
[16251.66s -> 16255.34s]  Let us vote. I feel like voting for characters is something we could do tomorrow
[16256.02s -> 16282.87s]  Because I'll have enough to actually make it make sense. This dude's cool. I like it. I is it hitting I think it's hitting I
[16283.75s -> 16290.93s]  kind of
[16290.93s -> 16308.26s]  Yeah, I am hitting him seems a little unfair. It's a downside. It's low. Here it comes
[16312.74s -> 16321.19s]  He turned into the dragon. Oh, that's a cosmic dragon over there. That's for sure. I get a burn this guy
[16321.79s -> 16356.29s]  From that shit. Give me that back. Come here. Give it that way. I throw it into the hole
[16357.03s -> 16378.33s]  Alright, don't attack. It's probably gonna shoot it back at us. It's spice over. Watch this. That's
[16379.25s -> 16381.25s]  That's so ridiculous
[16381.37s -> 16384.12s]  He's so good
[16384.16s -> 16400.61s]  It's so broken. Okay, the team look like no I didn't get anything. Was there a chance I could have gotten something?
[16401.05s -> 16415.32s]  Come on, did I really get our NG didn't get anything? Let's go Dark Knight
[16415.52s -> 16419.41s]  What?
[16419.85s -> 16427.16s]  You play something with fucking wicked nasty blood and guts
[16427.16s -> 16430.52s]  I want to see a game where you can fucking rip someone's head off and
[16431.28s -> 16433.28s]  Hold on. I want to read this
[16434.40s -> 16437.00s]  You'd play something with fucking wicked nasty blood and guts
[16437.00s -> 16441.32s]  I want to see a game where you can fucking rip someone's head off and blood sprays out and your character can start licking the
[16441.32s -> 16446.10s]  Blood and the blood splatters on the screen is wicked fucking gory and cool. That would be so cool
[16447.88s -> 16453.84s]  Let's go ally
[16453.96s -> 16466.69s]  Mmm, where's another dragon? I
[16469.12s -> 16471.66s]  Just beat you have to fight you over here, too
[16472.44s -> 16482.60s]  Getting close that reason to be far away for any reason
[16483.12s -> 16487.28s]  Plus this guy's gonna go underneath. Oh
[16490.12s -> 16494.32s]  That hurts. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay
[16495.08s -> 16503.77s]  Alright, let's do it. Oh
[16504.29s -> 16508.58s]  You are fucking slow, aren't you?
[16508.78s -> 16542.85s]  No, that was cocky. He's dead. Don't worry. I'll win. He's slow, but he has huge damage
[16549.45s -> 16558.88s]  He's done. Yeah, I don't I'm gonna win music. It's like super monkey ball. You like that. Where'd it go?
[16559.52s -> 16561.70s]  Well, that's not it
[16561.70s -> 16564.00s]  Dragon was just a normal enemy. He had
[16564.48s -> 16579.12s]  way out. Yep long-range
[16579.68s -> 16587.01s]  Still worth it. That means it's gonna be a oh, there's the real enemy. Oh
[16592.48s -> 16605.02s]  This just got bad fuck. I need that
[16613.74s -> 16618.59s]  Hi
[16627.39s -> 16629.39s]  Who's even attacking who?
[16629.63s -> 16652.31s]  Stay back dude. Who is doing that? Where can I get one of these guys? The purple shield guys are fucking insane. I
[16665.56s -> 16674.69s]  Wonder if this guy wait, he might wait what he did it. Yeah. Hey, he doesn't go to stab him
[16675.33s -> 16688.84s]  Nice job. He just had to go up and stab in the neck. I thought the Dark Knight was a roachies partner
[16689.40s -> 16707.80s]  It is some strange data in the gotcha box. That's the data. They stole from me gotcha red band 2.0
[16708.04s -> 16718.40s]  Neo-g-red my true power has returned
[16718.84s -> 16723.48s]  Of the death force has lost their death base things should remain calm for a little while
[16724.08s -> 16726.84s]  But I know that the Galactic Emperor hasn't given up on this planet
[16727.48s -> 16729.48s]  Actually, I fear that the battle has just begun
[16729.88s -> 16733.86s]  We must continue to grow the force so that we will be ready for the Galactic Emperor when the time comes
[16734.44s -> 16736.44s]  Vito I'm counting on you
[16736.84s -> 16738.84s]  You bet. I'm counting on you, too
[16745.70s -> 16755.88s]  Animated cutscene take a look. Ooh
[16758.68s -> 16765.52s]  He's much better
[16765.52s -> 16778.92s]  Plasma blade beam gatling and G Buster with Neo G crash. Nice. Oh, you're definitely gonna let's try you up
[16779.44s -> 16784.88s]  Too much. She's worth too much now
[16784.92s -> 16787.60s]  500 oh
[16787.60s -> 16805.74s]  Shit, he's worth a lot. I can't hang him. I have enough for 70. I play with
[16810.26s -> 16814.04s]  Law
[16814.52s -> 16815.72s]  Valkyrian
[16815.72s -> 16822.80s]  Sword about yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I can do a ninja. Wait, I can do somebody else, too

[16832.18s -> 16847.15s]  We saw the team. I'm gonna try one more fight and then we're gonna pick it up tomorrow
[16847.67s -> 16853.59s]  It's don't even play this game for six hours straight. Well, it's only been like five
[16854.29s -> 16863.44s]  Right. Yeah, good the new
[16864.76s -> 16867.04s]  G forces
[16869.02s -> 16874.04s]  Booyah turn penis. All right, funny that I laughed you got me
[16874.66s -> 16885.84s]  He's way stronger. That's you looking how much faster that shoots to look at the reload. This is great
[16886.36s -> 16890.55s]  He's hey has to be in every fight. Okay, hold on
[16891.23s -> 16895.72s]  That's so much better. Look at the member. Yeah, I love this. It's great
[16896.32s -> 16918.16s]  What about the charge? It's better. So it's much better too. Yeah. Oh, it's way better. The sword is a thousand times better
[16918.80s -> 16922.84s]  She's in through under the table
[16922.84s -> 16946.64s]  Okay, that's what I'm gonna call it tonight. We're back tomorrow
[16947.28s -> 16950.84s]  But before we go, I do want to bring up some things that we'll be doing

[16958.52s -> 16961.70s]  Wednesday depending on how I mean I I might want to beat the game
[16962.32s -> 16967.84s]  So we're gonna play this until I've had my fill. Let's see what happens tomorrow
[16971.28s -> 16978.06s]  Though tomorrow Wednesday and Thursday is the kind of tentative plan right now
[16978.60s -> 16987.24s]  So we'll see how it happens over the next couple of days. I'm gonna do brownies
[16989.84s -> 16993.36s]  Custom robo. I don't I mean custom robo right after this
[16993.96s -> 16996.70s]  Might need a break from robots toys fighting each other
[16997.60s -> 17005.85s]  At some point I want to play I do want to play the GTA online casino update
[17006.45s -> 17018.82s]  And I came out like a year ago and I haven't done it. We'll do that this week to brownie cooking stream
[17018.82s -> 17024.14s]  Well, I mean the I think the easy bake oven has a brownie. I'm fairly certain of that
[17024.58s -> 17029.05s]  So we'll see you tomorrow. I'm gonna play gotcha force again
[17029.73s -> 17033.80s]  Unlock some more robots
[17033.80s -> 17039.56s]  It's just fun to fight with robots and unlock stuff and keep upgrading it. It's just like a never-ending toy
[17040.44s -> 17048.04s]  Having a lot of fun. It's a great game. So I'll see you tomorrow sticking around. We're gonna do the bits and subs and everything
[17048.48s -> 17055.92s]  We'll see you tomorrow how gotchas work

[17264.13s -> 17266.13s]  There is a pizza if you're wondering there is a pizza
[17266.61s -> 17275.57s]  one thing that's gonna be really really important is I gotta check the expiration dates on this shit because I
[17276.39s -> 17278.31s]  can't I
[17278.31s -> 17281.03s]  if I get these packets in the mail and
[17282.58s -> 17284.70s]  They expired in June of like
[17285.30s -> 17286.50s]  2009
[17286.50s -> 17297.42s]  I'm done. I'm not going to eat them. They're all they're all gonna be expired. I don't think so right I'll try
[17297.42s -> 17301.22s]  I'll take a bite of each one, but that gross it's gonna be it's gonna be gross
[17301.22s -> 17303.51s]  I don't think I want to look well
[17303.51s -> 17311.84s]  It'll be a game time decision a curb umble on top of the ten thousand bits and hundred dollars gives another five
[17312.12s -> 17317.50s]  This one last bit drop because I forgot to mention these you look up the vocal version of the game's theme
[17317.50s -> 17324.14s]  We are gotcha force the Japanese vocals were removed from the localization since that's just how things were in 2003 I guess
[17328.94s -> 17334.17s]  vocals

[17356.68s -> 17390.87s]  Opening full version gotcha force Japanese opening this one is good, but that's not the one I meant wait what it's not the right one
[17391.39s -> 17398.11s]  This is Bella Lagasse. He's the last to ride, but he's singing the song
[17398.71s -> 17440.50s]  Keep playing it wait, so why why do they take this out is the right one?
[17489.61s -> 17499.61s]  It was gonna be a TV show and that he in a line of toys that didn't sell well, so they didn't do any of it
[17527.68s -> 17530.28s]  Use your clout to bring back gotcha force
[17536.06s -> 17538.75s]  Hey Capcom hey

[17565.41s -> 17572.69s]  new games robot fighting I have made a petition and it has been signed

[17582.01s -> 17588.14s]  We would really love it. We would appreciate it me and all the germamites. Well, let me say that again
[17588.34s -> 17594.04s]  Me and all the germamites. I was a little better, please Capcom
[17594.20s -> 17610.39s]  Here are prayers and I will end that I will end this petition with a song Capcom
[17610.79s -> 17615.27s]  We're all waiting for it. You know what to do
[17615.75s -> 17636.45s]  German on eight five and the germamites out also one of the thing if you could somehow could bring back Gino
[17636.77s -> 17639.46s]  It's a great character in the Nintendo franchise
[17639.98s -> 17645.12s]  Super Mario RPG. I mean, let's be honest if we're asking for shit
[17645.12s -> 17656.26s]  It'll never happen. I might as well throw some stuff on top. Let it play us out with a song. We are gotcha force
[17656.26s -> 17662.52s]  That's right. We are 31 of us, you know what to do Capcom
[17663.04s -> 17666.94s]  We we love you
[17676.22s -> 17692.32s]  That got really loud all the sudden sing along I don't I can't
[17697.12s -> 17710.48s]  Lyrics all right. I'm gonna turn on the lyrics to learn Japanese. All right. Well, that was fun
[17710.48s -> 17714.66s]  I'm sorry that I just I just don't think you woke up my mom. Oh
[17717.12s -> 17719.12s]  I don't know the petition
[17719.48s -> 17721.48s]  That'll get us to 32
[17721.56s -> 17733.89s]  Every one of these signatures counts man. Come on. That's a cool franchise. It just was you know
[17733.89s -> 17740.90s]  It was kind of I mean, it's not even like the game was dumpy at all. I mean if the game plays very well
[17740.90s -> 17742.94s]  It's a very polished experience the games fun
[17743.06s -> 17751.17s]  I think it's just kind of released at the wrong time. I was not gonna say I was gonna say dumpy
[17751.17s -> 17762.14s]  You're right, but it's not pretty well-made, but thank you curb humble shit Wembley TTV
[17762.14s -> 17765.02s]  Thanks for the 250 this awful voice actor reminds me of Dynasty Warriors 3
[17765.02s -> 17772.50s]  I do miss the time where Japanese video gaming companies would just get anyone who would speak English and act for the lowest price
[17772.50s -> 17778.54s]  I actually think a lot of them are phonetically reading the lines from what I've understood a
[17779.80s -> 17784.26s]  Lot of the Japanese to English voice acting that you hear is phonetic
[17784.60s -> 17788.84s]  They just they don't even know what they're saying. They just are told the way to say it
[17788.88s -> 17794.83s]  So I mean that's that that's pretty incredible if you think about it
[17795.35s -> 17806.80s]  Shenmue 3 did it on purpose
[17807.04s -> 17816.64s]  Really? Thanks of the 250. Hey the Pablo. Thanks for five dollars. Happy four months from the vaude gang. Hello vaude gang

[17907.88s -> 17913.12s]  And then they saw the gameplay and then I think I said was gonna happen they saw the collectible robots
[17913.12s -> 17929.64s]  They saw the characters and all of a sudden flipped the other way told you was gonna happen. They left
[17929.88s -> 17932.25s]  That's fine. You stayed
[17932.25s -> 17935.32s]  Hey, you stayed
[17935.88s -> 17942.16s]  So we can we can enjoy the game together if people don't want to watch
[17942.44s -> 17948.94s]  They don't have to and that's fine. They left you stayed and we got to see the fucking voices
[17948.94s -> 17952.26s]  we've got to see the cool gameplay and we got to see the collectibles and

[18083.55s -> 18091.37s]  It's it's like between four and like maybe five six drinks max
[18092.09s -> 18095.61s]  Maybe five I that I'm I would never
[18096.37s -> 18103.29s]  Go to a point where I was I don't even drink like that if I'm not streaming anyway, like if I'm just going out somewhere
[18103.33s -> 18104.17s]  I
[18104.17s -> 18107.25s]  Don't like get just shit-faced like that

[18146.85s -> 18161.25s]  That's unfortunate. I'm sorry here that thanks to the five dollars though. Oh, there's a great company
[18161.65s -> 18166.06s]  It's a whole system. Hold on. It's
[18166.98s -> 18182.73s]  This person if I was talking about drinking on the job to what wouldn't this person on thin ice?
[18183.41s -> 18206.06s]  Yeah, they were this is false lore
[18206.78s -> 18212.78s]  well, anyways
[18213.02s -> 18228.62s]  Thanks, Jerma lied about the turkey joke I did that has actually happened those either don't know what that is
[18228.62s -> 18231.84s]  I was supposed to have I supposed to get footage of
[18232.48s -> 18241.40s]  Me or somebody in a big turkey mask walking by my window in my old place in Massachusetts and I bought the mask
[18242.04s -> 18248.54s]  But before I moved to Vegas, I didn't do it and I didn't bring the turkey mask to Vegas
[18248.90s -> 18262.02s]  So it didn't happen. It was gonna be in video. I don't even know that. How do you know that?
[18262.38s -> 18267.71s]  I don't have I don't think I've ever publicly talked about how the turkey joke did I or
[18268.31s -> 18273.87s]  As you think of something else and did I just did you just do the to take you did the detective thing?
[18274.27s -> 18278.15s]  But you were talking about something else completely and I just admit it to all the crimes
[18279.03s -> 18286.79s]  Hey snoozing copter. Thanks for the 250
[18286.79s -> 18291.63s]  You just said you're looking for a game that plays like this and there actually is one but it's only on the 3ds
[18292.03s -> 18298.09s]  It's the kid Icarus uprising multiplayer mode. Really people actually still play it online
[18298.73s -> 18303.69s]  One of the most underrated games it's so good everyone in chat that played it back me up here
[18303.97s -> 18310.10s]  There's a ton of weapon and item variety. It was directed by Masahiro Sakurai himself
[18310.90s -> 18314.46s]  Unfortunately, you can't stream it, but you still enjoy it on your own. It's definitely worth it
[18315.06s -> 18317.94s]  So good. It's so good. So good. Oh
[18318.34s -> 18323.44s]  My god, yes kid Icarus uprising of this shit. It's pretty good
[18325.65s -> 18328.98s]  Get Gino in here
[18329.90s -> 18343.10s]  Get him in here. I would play it I would try it
[18346.10s -> 18350.46s]  I didn't I didn't play any kid Icarus games ever. So give me a nice
[18351.86s -> 18355.38s]  Dunking my toes in the water for that franchise. So maybe I would give it a try
[18355.86s -> 18358.94s]  Hey video games McGee. Thanks for the thousand bits
[18358.94s -> 18362.90s]  Am I the only one who thinks you look and sound like someone who would play JFK in a scary movie spinoff?
[18362.90s -> 18368.98s]  I don't know about that
[18376.10s -> 18378.10s]  scary movie spinoff
[18378.26s -> 18387.34s]  Like a Charlie Sheen scary movie like scary movie for I play JFK somehow. Is that what you mean by that?
[18387.34s -> 18395.55s]  What do you mean? Like a scary movie you have to mean that
[18398.08s -> 18403.89s]  Disaster movie epic movie that type. I don't know. I'm too young
[18403.89s -> 18407.78s]  I would need it another five years or so. Maybe
[18408.42s -> 18414.08s]  Thanks for the thousand bits. Hey one one one two E
[18414.62s -> 18417.50s]  Thanks for the 250. This looks like a game. My dad plays on his iPad
[18417.50s -> 18420.62s]  We I've read this one, but it made me laugh. So I said it earlier
[18421.26s -> 18428.67s]  Thanks for the 250. Hey Das Knight. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey, Jay loved watching you play GF
[18429.23s -> 18433.82s]  Hold on a bit gas a
[18434.14s -> 18435.82s]  Glad chat seemed to like it, too
[18435.82s -> 18440.42s]  I found memories playing the game on GameCube in the early 2000s with a girl at college
[18440.94s -> 18445.74s]  The game a thing we bonded over actually I was an English major and she took film studies
[18445.94s -> 18451.74s]  So we took it in turns to fight Borg while the other person explained recent lecture content sounds boring
[18451.74s -> 18457.94s]  I know but one fact she mentioned that always stuck with me was how Bella Lugosi died before plan 9 began production
[18458.42s -> 18461.74s]  Wow, so what did they do?
[18462.50s -> 18464.50s]  What could they have possibly done?
[18464.62s -> 18471.38s]  Hide that fact in the movie. That's interesting. Thanks for the knowledge
[18474.84s -> 18478.60s]  Yoda 985 gave 250. I said this one out loud, but I want to address it again
[18479.20s -> 18486.94s]  Remember the blood burger sounds like a fake rustling movie. You would say when Ronald McDonald kill somebody in the rumble. Yes. Yes
[18489.47s -> 18493.51s]  Peaceful Haley. Thanks for 250 speaking of when you talked about cheese when I was a kid
[18493.51s -> 18497.67s]  I would always pour shredded cheese in a bowl and just eat it like that all the time
[18497.99s -> 18502.47s]  So I would have bowl issues all the time as a kid because of my consumption of cheese
[18502.79s -> 18511.90s]  So one day my stomach was killing me wait bowl you bowel bowl
[18512.22s -> 18515.50s]  One day my stomach was killing me and I went to the hospital
[18515.50s -> 18520.14s]  he took my blood and etc and the doctor comes in and just shows me a grape and says you heard of these and
[18521.02s -> 18522.78s]  after that I had a
[18522.78s -> 18525.82s]  forced down prune juice and shit. I will never forget that

[18545.39s -> 18547.89s]  Was it all mushy and rotten?
[18548.09s -> 18555.12s]  Was that his pocket grape that he showed to young children to scare them and then make his joke to the parents?

[18637.23s -> 18639.52s]  because about
[18639.52s -> 18644.52s]  An hour ago an hour and a half ago the stream crashed because my VPN died
[18644.84s -> 18650.67s]  So these are the people that have subbed in the last hour and 30 minutes hour and 20 minutes. I
[18656.18s -> 18661.26s]  I can't the chat just what's exploded. It was so fast when I said the word VPN
[18661.26s -> 18665.02s]  I saw like a bunch of omega lows and like VPN omega. Like he was immediate
[18671.30s -> 18675.14s]  But anyways, thanks everybody sorry some you got
[18676.44s -> 18679.19s]  axed from this list
[18679.23s -> 18684.19s]  All right about that. It was the because of the server I picked won't be picking that one again

[18719.53s -> 18722.73s]  I learned on the wiki the original voice actor who voiced the main character
[18723.25s -> 18725.93s]  Ko Shishido was originally going to be
[18726.61s -> 18731.21s]  Hello, Lugosi, but unfortunately he died during production. They had to hire his grandchild to do the lines
[18732.81s -> 18735.62s]  All right, you I
[18736.54s -> 18741.98s]  My eyes rolled a little bit when I saw Bella Lugosi, but then his grandchild coming in he saved it
[18742.62s -> 18744.62s]  Saved it my eyes came back
[18744.62s -> 18754.83s]  That's funny Yoda 985 thanks to the 250 if chat keeps acting up you should spend a week playing Pokemon as punishment
[18755.19s -> 18765.71s]  That would be punishment to me too. So I don't think so. I think that would punish me more than you guys
[18770.60s -> 18772.80s]  Super paradox thanks for five dollars Jerma
[18773.32s -> 18777.88s]  Now you have to do Pokemon streams. I would literally bother you about it every stream. Don't please don't
[18778.40s -> 18783.57s]  Please don't do that. Don't bother me every stream about playing for I'm not gonna play it
[18783.57s -> 18786.49s]  I guess it was like a little hypothetical thing
[18787.17s -> 18793.73s]  I'm not gonna know don't bother me every stream. I'll ban you. I'll just I'll ban you
[18794.13s -> 18806.37s]  Hey, you asked for this. I'll ban you. Oh, don't bother me about this every day. I'll ban you play trapeze simulator
[18806.37s -> 18807.75s]  I'll ban the okay
[18807.75s -> 18814.86s]  But I'm playing that tomorrow if that's a real game and it's not like some stupid thing. That's not even real
[18815.22s -> 18822.25s]  I'll play for like five minutes. It's not even real. It can't be real. Thanks for the five dollars paradox
[18822.81s -> 18830.55s]  Appreciate it. I don't want to ban you moss lion. Thanks for 250 a tip to all the youngins in Chad
[18830.55s -> 18832.55s]  It's never too late to develop a skill or talent
[18832.71s -> 18839.40s]  Even if you're as old as me and Jerma taller than him though, just to be clear lol. What was that for?
[18840.24s -> 18849.34s]  Started off so sweet there. It's a strong now that you said that I feel like you're not taller than me
[18849.34s -> 18853.73s]  I feel like that's about what that's what somebody says when they're not the thing that they just said
[18853.89s -> 18857.27s]  You got to add that in just to make sure people know but I don't think you are
[18857.91s -> 18870.00s]  Thinking face a yoda 985. Thanks for the 250 when it comes to cookie dough
[18870.00s -> 18874.08s]  You got to cut out the middle man. Just put some chocolate chips on vanilla yogurt
[18874.12s -> 18879.56s]  It'd be a little honey and go to the refrigerator grab four raw eggs and eat those instead
[18880.44s -> 18889.06s]  Hey dark soul. Thanks for the 250. I mean, thanks for making me a mod. That's pretty pog
[18889.06s -> 18894.54s]  I use reddit like every day and have positive karma if you eat your veggies and snort your Funko's chat
[18894.54s -> 18901.58s]  You can be like me, too
[18906.40s -> 18911.24s]  Thanks, hey opster narwhal. Thanks for three dollars and 57 cents Jerma
[18911.24s -> 18914.84s]  I just got told I just got told to kill myself while playing overwatch
[18915.24s -> 18918.24s]  So I thought I'd come to be here for a little while some positive energy
[18918.24s -> 18923.60s]  Also, I'm remastering Jerma walk. So that looks like a little cleaner and loops better, too
[18923.68s -> 18926.68s]  Why is everybody to fucking be so mean and hate each other online?
[18927.40s -> 18930.34s]  In like video games and stuff. Why I gave why they were to be like that
[18930.78s -> 18946.09s]  Why is everybody like tell each other that kill themselves? It's online. Yeah
[18947.05s -> 18950.10s]  It's just like it's
[18950.10s -> 18962.29s]  We need to like relax. No, I think that a lot of people would would like do well
[18963.01s -> 18970.61s]  With having some device that if it detects if it detects you do it
[18970.61s -> 18976.17s]  This is something you set up on your own if it detects you saying something fucking crazy. It just plays it back in your ears
[18976.89s -> 18980.15s]  Because believe it or not if you hear yourself
[18980.87s -> 18987.06s]  Say something fucking really bad and really kind of fucked up and crazy. It's actually kind of embarrassing it is
[18987.58s -> 18995.18s]  You know what I mean? If it's like just be like like in your ears, not anybody else's like hey
[18995.18s -> 18997.18s]  Why don't you fucking kill yourself? Oh
[18997.78s -> 19002.66s]  Why don't you fucking kill yourself? No, I didn't why don't you fucking kill yourself? Fuck. That's embarrassing. It's really embarrassing
[19003.18s -> 19008.56s]  Do I sound like that? I sound like that. Oh fuck dude. I'm sorry
[19008.84s -> 19013.36s]  I'm just like just kidding around that decided we'd really angry and fucked up there. I didn't I don't like that
[19013.80s -> 19019.69s]  This is why we clip off
[19019.73s -> 19024.61s]  Don't you know what I'm doing? All right, don't even I'm clearing that one
[19024.73s -> 19031.48s]  But my point is is like sometimes if you hear is something you say
[19032.00s -> 19039.61s]  You know, it's like but nobody else needs to know you just have to hear it and go. Ooh fuck. That was a little much
[19040.29s -> 19042.29s]  Okay, I'm gonna turn it down a little
[19049.13s -> 19052.31s]  Text community nights gonna be something else. God damn it
[19052.93s -> 19059.76s]  No, oh
[19059.76s -> 19061.76s]  It's gonna be everywhere
[19062.04s -> 19065.48s]  It's gonna be everywhere. Don't I know that I'm being recorded
[19065.80s -> 19070.72s]  See it worked now. I'm like I'm embarrassed for saying something like that out fucking rages
[19070.72s -> 19084.79s]  And now it's been recorded and I heard it star used to record people like that and play it back to them
[19088.44s -> 19092.53s]  Anger is a funny thing because once you stop being angry
[19093.01s -> 19098.81s]  You can you kind of look back and go that really wasn't even a big deal at all
[19099.21s -> 19107.33s]  like anger is such an interesting emotion because half the time when you look back it's like
[19107.89s -> 19111.15s]  What the what who cares
[19111.71s -> 19117.61s]  Why would I let that get to me? You're like who cares? It's not even a big deal
[19118.33s -> 19126.69s]  Anger makes you delete your jump King save. No, that's
[19127.61s -> 19139.32s]  Intoxication. I think they're two different things. I'm so
[19140.32s -> 19143.56s]  Long be only fucking thinking about that one of the bath tonight. Oh
[19149.81s -> 19151.13s]  No
[19151.13s -> 19153.77s]  Like is that I was saying it too
[19154.45s -> 19156.45s]  very very strongly and
[19157.13s -> 19161.47s]  That could have been like me in a game holding the voice chat button
[19162.90s -> 19164.62s]  my god
[19164.62s -> 19166.98s]  What have I done? What have I done?
[19167.90s -> 19170.97s]  What have I done?
[19171.29s -> 19180.71s]  Whatever. Anyways, let's keep going. I'm gonna make it my ringtone
[19184.18s -> 19185.38s]  Hey
[19185.38s -> 19187.38s]  Hey, cano canoli
[19187.74s -> 19190.19s]  Was that your name?
[19190.19s -> 19192.58s]  Okay. No, it's
[19193.10s -> 19198.30s]  Only thanks for the 400 bits and watching for a long time now subscribing your passive support
[19199.18s -> 19208.70s]  LGBT folks means a lot. Yeah, I've said this I've said this a bunch of times. Just do you you you know you
[19209.26s -> 19211.55s]  Nobody can tell you
[19211.55s -> 19216.81s]  No one can tell you who you are cuz it's you you know that nobody else knows you you know you and do you
[19217.27s -> 19228.62s]  Other people are gonna do them and you're gonna do you this, you know, you I still don't know you don't who knows me
[19228.66s -> 19235.95s]  You do like I can't tell you who you are
[19237.92s -> 19239.92s]  How the fuck would I know?
[19239.96s -> 19242.06s]  Hey, I
[19242.06s -> 19244.54s]  This is who you are. I know who you are
[19245.10s -> 19261.92s]  You know, I've done I've no idea. So why would I pretend to just kind of this is my theory on it
[19262.40s -> 19268.85s]  Whoever you are, whatever you whatever walk of life or
[19269.65s -> 19272.42s]  however, you
[19272.42s -> 19273.78s]  identify
[19273.78s -> 19279.34s]  It I do I can't what why would I not support somebody individually
[19280.06s -> 19286.75s]  Doing what they want to do with your life. It's your life. It's not mine
[19286.75s -> 19310.30s]  I can't tell you how to run it and I mean that with everything and that there's not much more for me to say I
[19313.30s -> 19315.30s]  Live my life the way that I want to
[19315.74s -> 19321.92s]  At as best as I can as best as I know that I can now how I know myself. I hope you do the same
[19322.32s -> 19336.44s]  That's it it's my money and I need it now that was word soup I
[19341.33s -> 19343.85s]  Mean it wasn't it wasn't word soup
[19343.85s -> 19349.60s]  It was you I guess it kind of was a little soupy wasn't it? But alright, but you get my point though
[19349.76s -> 19365.10s]  That's all that matters. What if I want to sell drugs and kill people? Well, that's illegal
[19365.62s -> 19372.16s]  Like that's we've we've all agreed that that killing people is not. Okay, that's
[19375.12s -> 19377.12s]  almost every living human knows
[19377.48s -> 19380.00s]  That like killing somebody is that's
[19380.64s -> 19386.88s]  Your you are taking over somebody's life. You are taking control of somebody's life by killing them
[19387.24s -> 19391.54s]  You are putting power over somebody else's life
[19392.16s -> 19412.18s]  That's how that works. So come on streamer says up. Wait, I decide when you like no
[19413.50s -> 19415.34s]  I'm moving on
[19415.34s -> 19422.58s]  Long story short, I I can't tell you how to be you only you know that and I'm not gonna tell you how to be you
[19422.62s -> 19424.62s]  Cuz you're the only one that knows
[19424.62s -> 19430.16s]  Fucking soup eat it up. Hey go. Okay. Thanks for the five dollars
[19430.68s -> 19437.32s]  Reddit jokes are all fun and games until they call one of your favorite characters a reddit character. Oh sad face. Oh
[19438.34s -> 19440.96s]  oh
[19441.60s -> 19443.18s]  Oh
[19443.18s -> 19444.46s]  No
[19444.46s -> 19449.38s]  Not my favorite character, but Slimer and
[19450.53s -> 19457.06s]  Qbert he's a fucking dork. He's mocking us. Yes, of course I am
[19457.34s -> 19463.57s]  You know how much shit I got for Slimer back here wait till your characters are reddit character and then we'll see how you feel
[19464.17s -> 19473.10s]  Who cares? It's a fucking news website. All right. Hey dinosaurs Rex. Thanks for the 250
[19473.38s -> 19478.88s]  Hey German for the German rumble
[19478.88s -> 19482.60s]  I know you're already spoiling us with getting us to vote for the characters that will get in but hear me up
[19482.92s -> 19485.28s]  You should try doing a character creation contest
[19485.64s -> 19490.71s]  Each member gets to create one character and the character with the most votes gets put into the rumble
[19490.91s -> 19499.79s]  It could be pretty cool that's an interesting theory the one issue with that is turning it into a popularity contest
[19500.13s -> 19504.52s]  Because let's say for instance somebody makes a character that knows is gonna get up votes
[19505.00s -> 19508.16s]  versus a character that's incredibly well made but
[19508.80s -> 19514.62s]  Isn't part of the like kind of popularity contest in a way, you know
[19514.62s -> 19517.70s]  I I would have to pick them if I was gonna do that
[19517.70s -> 19519.70s]  I would go through and I'd pick the ones that I would want to put in
[19524.73s -> 19535.24s]  Yes, something like you up vote something so if we were to do something like that it would only be for a certain amount of
[19535.24s -> 19543.98s]  Slots like they would be one community character or like I have three community characters or maybe the community characters could be
[19545.06s -> 19549.14s]  part of their own tag team, you know if there was like a three like a six-way tag or like a
[19549.78s -> 19553.52s]  Tornado tag match it could be the community characters versus
[19554.70s -> 19560.34s]  Sam and Max shit. That's one of the fucking matches. That's not kidding
[19561.22s -> 19569.54s]  They'll probably be in it though. It's like a thousand different characters that haven't been made. But now it's a good
[19569.54s -> 19581.79s]  It's a good thought only give it a shot. Yeah, I would just choose because then it would just be like, oh Jerma
[19581.79s -> 19584.49s]  Just picked these he didn't pick mine
[19585.01s -> 19586.37s]  but he
[19586.37s -> 19591.17s]  There was just there was a ton of things to choose from when he picked just ones that he wanted and that would be it
[19591.49s -> 19594.62s]  Hey the the
[19595.10s -> 19596.14s]  uber noob
[19596.14s -> 19598.46s]  the uber
[19598.46s -> 19603.88s]  Noober the uber noob. Thanks for three dollars. Jerma loved playing this game as a child and actually just revisited it
[19604.46s -> 19606.42s]  And found it just as fun as I remembered. Yeah
[19606.42s -> 19607.42s]  It's it holds up pretty well
[19607.42s -> 19612.04s]  Glad to see you're enjoying it and even though chat kind of even chat kind of warms up to it
[19612.04s -> 19619.13s]  Yeah, they did depression has really been kicking my butt as of late and one of the few things I look forward to are your streams
[19619.41s -> 19628.91s]  Thanks for streaming this big part of my childhood much love from the UK at 430. That's late. That's very late
[19629.03s -> 19637.46s]  Well, I'm not sure if I should say good morning or good night. Either way one of those two. Thanks for the three bucks
[19637.62s -> 19646.50s]  Thanks for hanging out. Glad to have you here. Hey a friendly spider
[19646.58s -> 19648.42s]  Thanks for the 550 yo Yerma
[19648.42s -> 19655.03s]  Just want to say even though this is like message number 5,000 that you're a fucking awesome guy who always provides great entertainment
[19655.03s -> 19658.67s]  No matter what please keep doing what makes you happy cheers always
[19658.67s -> 19667.33s]  I will always try to do things that make me happy and make me have fun and especially on this stream
[19667.33s -> 19682.96s]  I'm going for it trying thanks for the $5.50 and thanks for the incredibly nice message a clowers V
[19682.96s -> 19688.66s]  Thanks for 250. I remember back when German refused to play some ads even when chat was begging for it now
[19688.66s -> 19690.82s]  Jerma talks non-stop about fast food chains
[19690.82s -> 19695.64s]  It even makes us watch their adverts and he does it for free Ernie Pog
[19695.80s -> 19700.97s]  Nobody has to pay me to tell you that the McChicken is like one of my favorite things in the world
[19700.97s -> 19703.85s]  I would somebody why would they need to be a transaction there?
[19703.89s -> 19709.20s]  Like that's just a fact from my mouth like the McChicken is my favorite one of my favorite things in the world
[19709.20s -> 19713.76s]  I nobody has to pay me to say that that's just a what it that's just a real fact
[19713.76s -> 19731.06s]  Oh, I had it too and it fucking trumpeted off at the end. Damn it. Whatever. It was close and then it just like
[19731.10s -> 19739.62s]  The hey, hallelujah. Thanks for the 300 bits $3. Hey a German
[19739.62s -> 19745.85s]  I don't know if this is be feasible back when he played rollercoaster tycoon 2 you mentioned needing servers to use the twitch integration

[19824.19s -> 19829.95s]  What and you do the look of me as your trademark and the Japanese audience would collectively lose their shit and cheer for you
[19829.95s -> 19831.13s]  You know what I'm saying?

[19848.70s -> 19852.68s]  Oh, yeah, I would do it. I would do I would go on one of those
[19852.68s -> 19855.63s]  I would go on with those shows and just do like that
[19856.67s -> 19862.23s]  It's like three or four times that would be with like the hands up
[19862.23s -> 19869.22s]  I'll just hit you that would be fun
[19869.22s -> 19872.64s]  And there would be an excuse to be in Japan and visit Japan eventually
[19872.64s -> 19879.12s]  I don't know if anybody has any pretty knows anybody that does do Japanese TV shows
[19879.12s -> 19887.22s]  I don't know how that's probably pretty that's probably not very many people. I don't know that'd be fun a goober juice
[19887.22s -> 19896.00s]  Thanks for 250 if the look of me taunt becomes a TF2 taunt would you play TF2 again? I don't I don't know man
[19897.16s -> 19909.58s]  the look of me taunt the look at look at look at me is just like me pretending that you're talking and

[19936.41s -> 19939.85s]  Well, I don't people don't but people have probably have no idea what it's probably some people here
[19939.85s -> 19943.50s]  They don't even know what you're talking about. But why they say why they saying look at me
[19943.66s -> 19954.29s]  Let's be honest if you're still here, there's no way right like if if yours here right now, you probably know
[19954.37s -> 19960.20s]  Well, somebody said it was the lion taunt. So I had to correct them. No, it's the one where you go

[20029.16s -> 20031.72s]  a good sleep

[20039.32s -> 20041.32s]  Pam band guys. See you. I
[20041.60s -> 20046.49s]  Would play I definitely would play Jackie Chan stunt master before Pokemon. That's a fact
[20047.05s -> 20054.44s]  Moo means moo. Thanks for the $4 bella legosi died in an unfortunate walk-in of an accident. That's unfortunate
[20054.76s -> 20065.00s]  Hey edge. Thanks for three dollars German return on smart click maps. Thank you. No, you're gonna make a dick happens every time
[20066.64s -> 20069.32s]  Maximum watts thanks for $5 a German
[20069.32s -> 20072.56s]  I just want to say I really appreciate your words on the matter of people telling each other that to kill themselves
[20073.08s -> 20079.48s]  Not that anyone cares, but I've seen family members and next-door neighbors take their own lives and it never leaves me as a human being
[20079.48s -> 20082.08s]  I know people are going to joke and laugh and that's okay
[20082.44s -> 20087.64s]  Doesn't dark place today remembering a lost childhood friend interesting how you bring that up today. Thank you
[20088.44s -> 20093.17s]  Let me know I can look nobody wants to
[20093.93s -> 20097.85s]  Feel shitty. You know, I mean nobody wants to feel bad about stuff
[20098.49s -> 20104.17s]  That's why it's I've always thought
[20105.05s -> 20112.04s]  There was some it was something like a level as you just kind of just don't you don't like
[20113.16s -> 20119.20s]  Especially in a setting where you don't know anybody and I guess that's the reason why people do it. It's why people do anything like that
[20120.04s -> 20123.12s]  you could say and wicked just awful shit because
[20124.20s -> 20126.88s]  These pretty people don't know who the fuck I am and who cares
[20127.64s -> 20137.99s]  so it's unfortunate, but that's just kind of the nature of
[20138.79s -> 20142.07s]  The internet where it's just kind of people just kind of say crazy shit
[20142.79s -> 20145.03s]  That's the way it is at this point
[20148.06s -> 20154.22s]  It doesn't mean that it can't affect somebody, you know, I mean if like somebody if you hear that and it's like well that sucks
[20155.46s -> 20160.98s]  Cuz I like know somebody that happened to do that and fuck now you have to think about that
[20161.90s -> 20166.58s]  Where on the other end it's just like somebody just kind of talking shit, right?
[20167.62s -> 20169.86s]  Just the nature of kind of anonymous
[20170.54s -> 20175.10s]  Everybody because the person that's saying it does not know that about you and
[20175.82s -> 20181.60s]  You know that they you don't know anything about them. They don't know anything about you and it's just kind of noise
[20183.16s -> 20187.78s]  It's way that's a way I would call it word soup. Yeah
[20196.24s -> 20205.49s]  Word soup, this is nonsense. This is all nonsense. What?
[20206.09s -> 20209.72s]  Am I like hearing myself talk? Am I like going crazy?
[20220.67s -> 20223.63s]  TL DW too long didn't watch
[20224.59s -> 20229.52s]  Try to relax on the fucking internet
[20230.24s -> 20233.00s]  You know, you just just pump the brakes a little
[20233.72s -> 20248.36s]  Just relax the board and we're cooped up. No, but you don't I mean
[20249.20s -> 20252.78s]  But people like talk shit
[20253.34s -> 20257.96s]  but this talking shit and then his
[20258.64s -> 20272.75s]  Trying to be as like awful as possible. You know what I'm saying? I like jokey shit talking
[20272.75s -> 20274.75s]  I think a lot of people do I do
[20274.83s -> 20283.10s]  It can be fun
[20283.10s -> 20284.38s]  regardless
[20284.96s -> 20289.24s]  Thanks for the $5 and it does affect people as you can see
[20289.76s -> 20296.99s]  Hey app key. Thanks for the $5 derma any plans to play DBZ games. It'd be pretty neat
[20296.99s -> 20300.27s]  I think I don't want to watch the DBZ show before I play the DBZ games
[20300.27s -> 20302.83s]  Which has not happened yet and might never happen
[20303.47s -> 20318.88s]  We'll see a somnus. Thanks for the $5 Jeremy so excited for the League of Legends and Valorant back-to-back stream tomorrow
[20321.14s -> 20325.66s]  Pokemons more likely. I'm gonna have that tier system set up. I got a question though
[20325.66s -> 20331.62s]  Does chat ever overwhelm or exhaust you? I can't imagine being called a fucking weirdo for hours by thousands people without losing my mind
[20332.42s -> 20334.92s]  Um, yeah
[20334.92s -> 20340.20s]  No, I mean if I start to well, that's when I turn streams off, you know, I'd like
[20340.88s -> 20344.30s]  If it's like okay, I've kind of had enough
[20345.00s -> 20351.61s]  Not of chat but just in general like usually I kind of just gauge after four or five six hours if it's like
[20351.61s -> 20354.81s]  I got kind of gonna take a break and kind of get out of here
[20355.33s -> 20360.40s]  So
[20360.40s -> 20363.84s]  No, not necessarily overwhelm or exhaust but I
[20364.68s -> 20369.57s]  kind of just gauge how I currently feel on a really
[20370.45s -> 20372.45s]  almost minute-to-minute basis as
[20372.57s -> 20378.41s]  You see some streams can be and I mean the reason why I'm making streams four to five hours now
[20379.17s -> 20382.81s]  This one will be about six, but it's just because of medical reasons
[20382.81s -> 20387.73s]  I'm just trying to not sit in the same place for more than four or five hours of time and
[20388.69s -> 20391.21s]  It's it's helping so that's the reason for that
[20392.01s -> 20393.81s]  but no
[20393.81s -> 20399.85s]  You'll know I've if I really need like to take a break. I usually just go alright, like I'm out of here. I
[20400.69s -> 20408.29s]  Don't I don't make a big deal out of it. I'm not I oh you guys are so exhausting the absolute fuck out of me
[20408.29s -> 20412.17s]  I can't take it anymore. Goodbye. No, that hasn't really happened
[20412.81s -> 20415.50s]  It doesn't really happen at all
[20415.54s -> 20422.52s]  But yeah, it usually goes pretty smoothly
[20423.99s -> 20431.48s]  Thanks for five dollars. Hey travel boy. Thanks for five dollars. Your take on LGBTQ is the libertarian take on LGBT q
[20431.92s -> 20434.24s]  We finally got a political opinion out of you

[20446.21s -> 20450.16s]  Oh
[20450.16s -> 20453.84s]  How does it wait? How do you go from libertarian to centrist? Oh
[20459.70s -> 20468.92s]  Here we're going down the rabbit hole
[20469.72s -> 20476.95s]  He's a centrist libertarian communist. Yeah, that's whatever. That's whatever. That's fine
[20477.55s -> 20486.74s]  Let's just say that that's all right. I'm gonna just say Bernie Pog. It'll fix it
[20489.90s -> 20498.96s]  You guys already do I I don't
[20499.58s -> 20505.18s]  We don't talk politics, but I give you beliefs and I give you kind of stances on stuff
[20505.18s -> 20509.26s]  I think you could piece together kind of how I feel about the world
[20509.26s -> 20523.88s]  I think it wouldn't be very hard at this point hates the lower class. Oh
[20526.16s -> 20531.86s]  man
