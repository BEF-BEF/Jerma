[4.66s -> 8.34s]  I can't even put into words how upset I am right now.
[8.34s -> 11.70s]  I've missed the wine convention by two hours,
[11.70s -> 16.34s]  and I bought this special red wine suit to prove how much I love wine,
[16.34s -> 18.82s]  and now what am I supposed to do, throw it in the trash?
[18.82s -> 20.34s]  Oh hey Jerm, how the fuck out of here?
[22.31s -> 26.07s]  By the way, can I just say, we both look like fucking idiots.
[28.71s -> 30.31s]  You look like a Dead Rising character.
[31.11s -> 32.55s]  Look at how I'm leaning in.
[32.55s -> 33.59s]  Can I not hear him?
[34.55s -> 35.35s]  What's he saying?
[37.03s -> 38.71s]  Okay, yeah, I got it. I gotta be real close.
[38.71s -> 40.39s]  You know, I don't hear so well no more.
[41.51s -> 43.27s]  I look like I just work in a movie theater.
[45.59s -> 46.63s]  You look like an usher.
[47.51s -> 50.07s]  What's with the Gatorade tattoo you have on your arm?
[51.75s -> 53.51s]  That's supposed to be a slight lightning bolt.
[53.51s -> 55.35s]  That's a fucking Gatorade logo.
[56.63s -> 57.13s]  No.
[61.64s -> 62.60s]  You're doing the hacking job.
[62.60s -> 63.96s]  Okay, so now I'm the hacker. Got it.
[64.52s -> 65.62s]  I'll do the hacking.
[66.84s -> 68.68s]  So on the way there, I gotta hack the system.
[72.78s -> 74.06s]  Not easy.
[77.24s -> 78.84s]  Fucking no, shit.
[80.41s -> 81.53s]  What did we lose the height?
[84.34s -> 85.83s]  Don't make me laugh.
[93.98s -> 96.54s]  Don't sneeze like a fucking dickhead.
[96.54s -> 97.42s]  Give me a second.
[99.58s -> 100.62s]  I can't fail it again.
[101.88s -> 103.00s]  I failed it again.
[103.64s -> 105.56s]  I actually have to blow my nose right now.
[105.56s -> 106.06s]  Let's go.
[107.67s -> 108.71s]  The fucking stick up.
[109.43s -> 113.13s]  Another block.
[114.14s -> 115.02s]  Good idea.
[115.02s -> 115.74s]  Real good idea.
[116.70s -> 118.22s]  That's not so much of a good idea,
[118.22s -> 119.74s]  except I think it might have just worked.
[121.02s -> 123.34s]  Holy shit, how the hell did you pull that off?
[123.34s -> 124.78s]  It was like Dukes of Azeroth.
[125.42s -> 127.66s]  You just did like a Tony Hawk ollie off of a wall.
[128.94s -> 131.22s]  Okay, I gotta admit, that was pretty impressive,
[131.22s -> 132.34s]  but can you do it again?
[135.75s -> 136.95s]  Just like squeezed right there.
[136.95s -> 138.47s]  That was nice, man.
[139.19s -> 140.55s]  I think we're gonna blow up this bridge.
[141.27s -> 141.77s]  What?
[142.23s -> 144.25s]  All right, we're looking at the bridge here.
[145.99s -> 147.11s]  Is there a helicopter there?
[147.11s -> 148.31s]  Do we have to destroy the helicopter?
[148.95s -> 149.91s]  No, that's for us.
[150.55s -> 151.51s]  What do you mean that's for us?
[153.30s -> 155.14s]  It's magnetizing us to it.
[155.14s -> 156.98s]  We're gonna get sucked up by a super magnet?
[161.35s -> 162.55s]  Oh, did you just get out?
[163.90s -> 164.94s]  Did you get out of the car?
[165.90s -> 166.70s]  Oh my gosh.
[176.62s -> 177.34s]  We'll take him down.
[177.34s -> 179.02s]  I want an APB put out of this guy.
[179.02s -> 180.54s]  We're not gonna stop until he's here.
[180.54s -> 181.50s]  Where'd he go?
[181.50s -> 182.06s]  Where is he?
[183.10s -> 184.78s]  I don't remember anything.
[184.78s -> 186.06s]  Can anyone remember anything?
[186.06s -> 186.70s]  I don't remember.
[186.70s -> 189.10s]  There's nine bullets discharged from my gun.
[189.10s -> 190.22s]  Why did I do that?
[190.22s -> 192.22s]  All I remember is I'm the bad cop.
[193.82s -> 195.34s]  I think I'm a bad cop.
[196.14s -> 196.94s]  I'm gonna go home.
[197.74s -> 200.87s]  I'm in the prison bus.
[200.87s -> 201.75s]  I'm just gonna drive.
[202.39s -> 203.11s]  We're all behind you.
[203.83s -> 206.58s]  What is this car doing?
[206.58s -> 208.02s]  This isn't even a cop that just ran me.
[209.78s -> 212.90s]  Man, there's like speed demons on the road for some fucked up reason.
[215.22s -> 217.30s]  Did somebody fly out of the sky?
[217.30s -> 218.42s]  Oh, I don't want to go in here.
[218.42s -> 221.37s]  I actually screwed up.
[221.37s -> 223.14s]  What was that?
[223.14s -> 225.22s]  Why did the guy just fall from the sky?
[226.10s -> 227.30s]  You need to kill this helicopter.
[229.72s -> 230.12s]  Perfect.
[233.10s -> 234.06s]  Very, very nice.
[234.06s -> 235.18s]  I hope we don't blow this up.
[235.18s -> 236.62s]  Oh, there's a helicopter right in front of us.
[237.34s -> 238.86s]  Oh, and this thing's upside down.
[239.74s -> 240.86s]  We're just sliding down.
[241.82s -> 242.46s]  Come on.
[242.46s -> 243.98s]  Actually, oh, wow.
[245.19s -> 246.07s]  Holy shit.
[246.79s -> 250.31s]  Did that seriously just end up working in our favor?
[252.47s -> 254.79s]  That can't be serious right now, right?
[256.52s -> 257.16s]  We're not found.
[258.28s -> 259.64s]  Quiet, quiet, quiet, shut up.
[259.64s -> 260.20s]  Oh, they've had us.
[260.20s -> 260.70s]  Fuck.
[263.10s -> 265.02s]  I mean, in full uniform, but.
[266.76s -> 267.56s]  Shit.
[267.56s -> 268.68s]  Take a right at the street.
[271.37s -> 272.89s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[272.89s -> 273.69s]  Oh, fuck.
[273.69s -> 274.57s]  That's not the street.
[274.57s -> 275.37s]  Just take a right.
[275.37s -> 276.09s]  You're still fine.
[276.09s -> 277.37s]  He's in between.
[277.37s -> 278.25s]  Oh, come on.
[279.93s -> 280.89s]  Hold X to duck.
[282.71s -> 283.43s]  Hold X.
[283.43s -> 283.99s]  Hold X.
[283.99s -> 284.63s]  You're not holding it.
[287.35s -> 289.11s]  We're in some guy's garage.
[289.11s -> 289.67s]  Oh, my gosh.
[289.67s -> 290.15s]  They're coming.
[290.87s -> 292.15s]  They're not going to see us.
[292.15s -> 292.95s]  They're not going to see us.
[292.95s -> 293.99s]  They're coming down the street.
[293.99s -> 295.03s]  We'll hide in a garage.
[295.03s -> 295.75s]  They can't even see.
[295.75s -> 296.63s]  Oh, my gosh.
[296.63s -> 297.13s]  Oh.
[298.78s -> 299.66s]  You're not even in my car.
[300.94s -> 302.22s]  Oh, you're in the back.
[302.22s -> 302.54s]  Hold on.
[302.54s -> 303.34s]  Let me get in there.
[307.82s -> 309.02s]  I'm so glad that worked.
[309.02s -> 310.62s]  He just pulled into his garage.
[310.62s -> 312.54s]  Yeah, we like ran into that guy.
[312.54s -> 313.90s]  That guy could have just called the police.
[313.90s -> 315.02s]  He's on the ground dead.
[315.02s -> 316.06s]  Oh, no, he's not.
[316.70s -> 317.66s]  That guy ran in his house.
[317.66s -> 318.94s]  He probably could have just called the police
[318.94s -> 320.78s]  and been like, oh, you're looking for a guy in a cop car?
[321.74s -> 324.54s]  He just like hit me and is hiding in my garage.
[324.54s -> 328.52s]  There's a car that's going to pull up here in a second.
[329.08s -> 330.04s]  This one right here.
[330.04s -> 331.00s]  Two guys are going to get out.
[332.34s -> 334.34s]  And you have to pick who you want to shoot
[334.34s -> 336.10s]  because we have to shoot them both at the same time.
[336.10s -> 336.90s]  How long do we have?
[337.62s -> 338.18s]  Like now.
[338.18s -> 338.50s]  Ready?
[338.50s -> 339.38s]  I'm going to get the guy on the right.
[339.38s -> 339.94s]  Are you ready?
[339.94s -> 340.50s]  Sure.
[340.50s -> 341.86s]  Three, two, one, shoot.
[342.90s -> 344.66s]  Now go get the we got to get the briefcase.
[354.81s -> 356.25s]  I thought since you did this before,
[356.25s -> 357.77s]  this was the surefire way to do it.
[358.87s -> 360.15s]  Just hold on a second.
[360.15s -> 361.27s]  I have to go get some snacks.
[362.36s -> 365.56s]  Sir, do you have any butterfingers or Eggo waffles here?
[365.56s -> 366.20s]  I'm craving them.
[367.78s -> 368.82s]  Put all the money in the register.
[370.22s -> 370.70s]  Hurry up.
[370.70s -> 371.42s]  Make it snappy.
[371.42s -> 372.46s]  Oh, I thought this was a handgun.
[375.56s -> 376.84s]  Did that really just happen?
[376.84s -> 377.72s]  I'm sorry.
[377.72s -> 378.92s]  I just wanted some snacks.
[380.12s -> 381.32s]  I see the guy in the plane.
[382.12s -> 382.36s]  Yeah.
[382.36s -> 383.08s]  What is his job?
[383.08s -> 384.36s]  Is he just like kind of circling around?
[384.36s -> 385.48s]  I'm not sure what he's supposed to do,
[385.48s -> 386.60s]  but he's supposed to pick us up.
[386.60s -> 387.32s]  He's our getaway.
[389.08s -> 389.48s]  All right.
[389.48s -> 390.44s]  We're about to park.
[391.62s -> 392.82s]  I'm not supposed to get out of the car.
[392.82s -> 393.86s]  You're supposed to pull me out.
[393.86s -> 395.06s]  No, you're my prisoner.
[395.06s -> 395.70s]  I take you out.
[395.70s -> 396.58s]  So you're in handcuffs.
[398.58s -> 400.26s]  Get out of here, you fucking scumbag.
[401.85s -> 402.33s]  Don't worry.
[402.33s -> 402.89s]  I got this.
[402.89s -> 403.85s]  I got this, asshole.
[405.05s -> 405.85s]  So you have to walk.
[406.87s -> 407.83s]  Don't do anything insane.
[413.42s -> 418.98s]  Oh, you idiot.
[418.98s -> 421.80s]  Why did you do that?
[422.52s -> 423.70s]  We can still do it.
[423.70s -> 424.42s]  We can still do it.
[425.14s -> 427.66s]  I mean, this can be the hardest thing in the world,
[427.66s -> 428.46s]  but we can still do it.
[430.25s -> 430.97s]  Hold on.
[430.97s -> 431.61s]  We need to go.
[434.10s -> 434.98s]  A little premature.
[436.90s -> 437.38s]  Holy shit.
[437.38s -> 438.74s]  Did that guy just jump?
[438.74s -> 440.18s]  Fucking kill them both.
[441.40s -> 442.04s]  Oh, my gosh.
[443.61s -> 445.45s]  You just totally screwed us.
[445.45s -> 445.85s]  I know.
[446.49s -> 450.01s]  I can't believe we're actually still alive.
[450.65s -> 451.93s]  I don't even know what we're doing now.
[452.65s -> 453.69s]  You need to start shooting people.
[453.69s -> 455.37s]  I haven't seen you shoot your gun one time.
[455.37s -> 456.65s]  We have to get the prisoner out.
[462.23s -> 464.47s]  There's no markers there.
[465.43s -> 466.15s]  I'll mark it for you.
[468.86s -> 470.46s]  No, it looks like he's flying to us.
[470.46s -> 471.02s]  Airplane.
[471.82s -> 474.90s]  That's a cop helicopter, I think.
[475.70s -> 476.34s]  Is it?
[476.34s -> 478.26s]  We need to get another teammate.
[478.26s -> 480.34s]  I got just destroyed from behind.
[482.28s -> 482.60s]  Hopefully.
[482.60s -> 483.48s]  Oh, Jesus, man.
[483.48s -> 488.26s]  It just spawned me in such a stupid spot.
[488.26s -> 489.38s]  Holy shit.
[489.38s -> 490.10s]  Oh, my God.
[490.74s -> 491.86s]  Oh, dear God, dude.
[493.74s -> 494.86s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[494.86s -> 495.50s]  This is horrible.
[496.22s -> 497.18s]  We might look at we're going to lose.
[498.22s -> 500.22s]  I'm shooting just rockets in like every direction.
[505.13s -> 506.01s]  Okay, why?
[506.89s -> 511.37s]  Why would it spawn me in the middle of the fucking street?
[512.09s -> 516.41s]  With like nine cruisers and four helicopters.
