[5.50s -> 9.48s]  Is it? It is.
[9.48s -> 12.92s]  My dad had over 100 hours in that game, he'll crush you.
[12.92s -> 13.88s]  I'm sure it's fun.
[14.76s -> 18.36s]  The online play probably takes it up a whole another letter grade or two.
[18.36s -> 21.24s]  I would say. At least.
[21.24s -> 24.18s]  Black screen, it is.
[24.18s -> 26.65s]  Yes, it is.
[29.24s -> 30.52s]  Okay, you guys ready?
[30.52s -> 34.42s]  All right, what do we got here? Let's see.
[40.12s -> 41.56s]  I did a couple of these already, as you see.
[41.56s -> 43.40s]  This one's five by five, let's just go for it.
[44.12s -> 44.84s]  It'll be simple.
[45.72s -> 48.20s]  It's just gonna be simple.
[49.08s -> 50.63s]  Use the hint roulette.
[50.63s -> 51.13s]  No.
[52.01s -> 56.67s]  Okay, so how does this work?
[56.67s -> 57.63s]  Well, with the controller.
[58.19s -> 58.99s]  How do I like move?
[61.58s -> 63.18s]  How do you move?
[69.24s -> 79.02s]  Uh, is this the stick?
[79.02s -> 80.94s]  Okay, left stick is select because this is...
[80.94s -> 82.06s]  Okay, that's up?
[82.06s -> 82.56s]  Maybe.
[83.66s -> 84.46s]  Right?
[84.46s -> 84.96s]  No?
[85.74s -> 87.21s]  Touch the screen.
[87.21s -> 90.33s]  It is a screen touch game, but I have a controller, so I wonder how this works.
[91.53s -> 92.25s]  Push in the stick?
[93.05s -> 95.04s]  This is a touch only game.
[96.00s -> 99.04s]  I have to touch the TV.
[100.64s -> 102.08s]  The d-pad does the same thing.
[102.08s -> 102.58s]  Hold on.
[103.28s -> 107.29s]  Oh, here we go.
[110.38s -> 110.88s]  Yes.
[113.37s -> 113.87s]  Uh...
[115.79s -> 116.51s]  How do I do this?
[118.89s -> 120.62s]  Hint roulette.
[120.62s -> 121.18s]  Navigation.
[121.90s -> 123.45s]  Auto-correct mistakes.
[124.09s -> 124.81s]  Also controls.
[124.81s -> 125.45s]  Input mode.
[125.45s -> 126.25s]  Touch.
[126.25s -> 126.49s]  Buttons.
[126.49s -> 126.97s]  There we go.
[127.69s -> 130.06s]  I think that's good.
[130.70s -> 132.52s]  All right, we're good.
[135.55s -> 136.59s]  There we are.
[136.59s -> 137.79s]  All right, very cool, very cool.
[137.79s -> 138.59s]  Okay, so here we go.
[139.23s -> 141.31s]  Those who don't know how to play Picross.
[142.67s -> 143.71s]  Watch and learn.
[143.71s -> 149.21s]  It's about marking stuff down.
[151.10s -> 152.30s]  I actually can't even describe it.
[152.30s -> 153.82s]  My brain's like really slow today.
[154.54s -> 156.38s]  All right, let me explain it.
[156.38s -> 158.46s]  Because these people have no fucking idea what's going on.
[158.46s -> 161.10s]  I know this is like a channel meme, but there's 13,000 people here.
[161.10s -> 162.14s]  Half of them probably never heard of this.
[163.10s -> 163.82s]  Maybe even less.
[164.62s -> 165.26s]  Okay, so.
[166.54s -> 168.86s]  In each one of these, see the number three on the left?
[168.86s -> 171.74s]  That means that there are three squares filled in somewhere here.
[172.38s -> 172.88s]  Right?
[173.50s -> 174.92s]  See this one one?
[174.92s -> 179.40s]  That means there are two ones filled in here.
[179.40s -> 181.96s]  And it's not, oh, that means they can't be together.
[181.96s -> 185.88s]  There has to be at least one space in the middle of those two ones.
[185.88s -> 186.36s]  Has to be.
[187.00s -> 187.64s]  At least one.
[188.36s -> 189.80s]  But that could not be two in a row.
[189.80s -> 192.52s]  It'd have to be like here and here, for instance.
[192.52s -> 194.20s]  So let's give it a go.
[194.20s -> 197.64s]  As you see, one space, three.
[197.64s -> 199.96s]  Therefore, there's only five spaces.
[199.96s -> 201.24s]  One space, three.
[201.88s -> 203.16s]  They have to be here.
[203.16s -> 204.06s]  You understanding?
[204.06s -> 204.70s]  Are you getting it?
[207.18s -> 209.58s]  Okay, so I want to mark this as an X.
[209.58s -> 210.70s]  Because I don't want to mess with that.
[210.70s -> 212.54s]  Because I don't want them to see that.
[213.50s -> 215.31s]  Again, there's only three spaces.
[215.31s -> 216.51s]  So one, two, three.
[216.51s -> 217.31s]  One, two, three.
[217.31s -> 221.79s]  It has to literally be, it can't, it has to be here.
[221.79s -> 222.99s]  This can't be here.
[222.99s -> 223.87s]  I don't know that yet.
[224.43s -> 228.41s]  But this is, I know that.
[228.41s -> 229.13s]  Mark that one.
[229.69s -> 230.65s]  Very, very interesting.
[230.65s -> 232.01s]  By the way, you can do this as well.
[232.01s -> 233.29s]  Because there's obviously not a one there.
[233.29s -> 234.65s]  There's obviously not a one there.
[234.65s -> 236.09s]  There's obviously not a one here as well.
[237.34s -> 240.78s]  So, class, where can this one be?
[240.78s -> 243.82s]  It's only in a couple of places, as you've been able to tell, as you can see.
[245.00s -> 246.36s]  Very, very interesting.
[246.36s -> 268.20s]  What am I doing?
[268.20s -> 268.92s]  So here's the thing.
[269.48s -> 274.94s]  Anytime I play these games on stream, I just, I can't, I just can't do them.
[275.50s -> 281.36s]  It's something about like this, I see colors, but I don't see what to do.
[282.24s -> 283.76s]  Does anybody else get like that?
[286.11s -> 289.55s]  I could lie in bed and do like a 20 by 21 of these.
[289.55s -> 290.91s]  And just sit there and be relaxed.
[291.63s -> 293.15s]  But like, I know I'm on camera.
[293.15s -> 294.59s]  Like, I know I'm on stream.
[294.59s -> 295.71s]  And I know I have to talk to you.
[296.75s -> 297.87s]  Like, I can't do it.
[301.92s -> 305.60s]  Like, the part of my brain that does puzzles is the part of my game,
[305.60s -> 307.44s]  part of my brain that communicates with humans.
[308.16s -> 309.76s]  So like, I can't do them both at the same time.
[310.80s -> 314.12s]  Let's see if it happens if I just stop talking and turn the volume all the way down.
[314.12s -> 347.95s]  This part of your brain communicates with the mothership.
[348.67s -> 353.55s]  All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[353.55s -> 355.80s]  You ready?
[355.80s -> 357.24s]  I don't want the hint roulette.
[357.24s -> 358.28s]  It's 10 by 10.
[358.28s -> 358.84s]  Here we do it.
[358.84s -> 359.24s]  Let's move.
[359.24s -> 359.64s]  Here we go.
[360.36s -> 361.72s]  This is a full row of 10.
[362.60s -> 363.72s]  This is a full row of 10.
[364.28s -> 366.52s]  Just get those, get the ones you know you can do.
[367.32s -> 368.12s]  This is a nine.
[368.12s -> 372.04s]  What that means is it has to be filled in all the way except for the two ends.
[372.04s -> 372.76s]  Get it?
[372.76s -> 387.10s]  Throw this one all the way in.
[387.10s -> 387.58s]  Very cool.
[388.22s -> 390.38s]  One, two, three, space, one.
[390.38s -> 391.42s]  We don't know that yet.
[393.61s -> 396.09s]  We know it's these two because one, two, three, one, two, three.
[397.31s -> 398.11s]  There's your one.
[398.83s -> 399.63s]  There's your two.
[400.27s -> 401.15s]  There's your second two.
[401.15s -> 402.19s]  We don't know where it is though.
[406.81s -> 407.77s]  We play with heat maps.
[407.77s -> 408.01s]  No.
[411.21s -> 411.85s]  There's your two.
[412.41s -> 414.70s]  There's your eight.
[415.26s -> 417.37s]  There's your one.
[417.37s -> 418.65s]  There's your other one.
[418.65s -> 419.45s]  There's your other one.
[420.75s -> 421.63s]  There's your full row.
[422.43s -> 424.33s]  OK.
[424.33s -> 425.05s]  There's your two.
[425.77s -> 428.33s]  There's your one and there's your other one.
[428.33s -> 432.04s]  This row is done too.
[432.04s -> 432.84s]  Where's your other?
[432.84s -> 433.48s]  I don't know yet.
[433.48s -> 433.88s]  Not sure.
[433.88s -> 435.88s]  But actually, I do know because it has to be over here.
[436.68s -> 437.88s]  There's your two.
[437.88s -> 438.68s]  Here's your row.
[440.16s -> 440.96s]  Alright this is your nine.
[440.96s -> 442.16s]  Your nine is complete.
[442.16s -> 442.72s]  There's your two.
[445.16s -> 447.08s]  We don't know where the one is at this moment.
[447.08s -> 447.64s]  There's your two.
[448.78s -> 450.86s]  There's your three.
[450.86s -> 451.40s]  Alright.
[451.40s -> 452.36s]  Where's your three?
[452.36s -> 453.08s]  There's your three.
[453.88s -> 454.60s]  There's your two.
[454.60s -> 458.81s]  There's your other two.
[458.81s -> 469.39s]  Okay, there's your 3, there's your 2, there's your 1, and there's your 1, there's your 1,
[469.39s -> 476.85s]  and there's your 2, there's your 1, there's your 8, and there's your other 1.
[476.85s -> 478.85s]  Hope you were taking notes.
[478.85s -> 487.19s]  The game still says Mario Golf.
[487.19s -> 492.57s]  Oh.
[492.57s -> 495.97s]  You're gonna lose 90% of your viewers.
[495.97s -> 496.97s]  I'm gonna be fine.
[496.97s -> 504.26s]  This game is really chill.
[504.26s -> 505.26s]  It is actually really chill.
[505.26s -> 506.50s]  The best part?
[506.50s -> 507.50s]  Oh, this is the best part.
[508.30s -> 509.30s]  If you get...
[509.30s -> 512.60s]  So, remember, we're filling the whole thing because it's 10.
[512.60s -> 513.60s]  I love this.
[513.60s -> 516.16s]  This feels the best.
[516.16s -> 517.16s]  Because you get...
[517.16s -> 518.16s]  See?
[518.16s -> 519.16s]  Okay, look at the people that are confused.
[519.16s -> 524.56s]  So, because I know that this whole bottom row is filled, so the whole is 10 by 10, it
[524.56s -> 527.26s]  has to be every single one.
[527.26s -> 530.68s]  These are part of these columns, right?
[530.68s -> 535.96s]  So I know, see 1, 6, 1 over here?
[535.96s -> 537.32s]  This is the 1.
[537.32s -> 540.92s]  So, there is no other place for that to be, so you get to mark that.
[541.64s -> 542.64s]  Take a look at that.
[542.64s -> 543.64s]  See the 2 at the bottom?
[543.64s -> 544.64s]  This has to be that 2.
[544.64s -> 546.44s]  There's nothing else it could be.
[546.44s -> 548.54s]  Then you can mark it.
[548.54s -> 550.10s]  Again, 2.
[550.10s -> 551.10s]  Mark it again.
[551.10s -> 553.26s]  See, it has to be that 2 in the column.
[553.26s -> 554.26s]  Because it's already here.
[554.26s -> 555.26s]  2 again.
[555.26s -> 556.26s]  Mark that.
[556.26s -> 557.26s]  Because there has to be a space in between.
[557.26s -> 558.26s]  Make sure you mark it.
[558.26s -> 562.32s]  This is a 1.
[562.32s -> 564.24s]  Nothing else is coming after that because there has to be a space.
[564.24s -> 566.24s]  Make sure you mark it.
[566.24s -> 568.24s]  I tried to mark it, and I got it wrong, apparently.
[568.24s -> 570.24s]  I hit the wrong button.
[570.24s -> 572.19s]  Okay.
[572.19s -> 573.19s]  2.
[573.19s -> 574.19s]  Again.
[574.23s -> 575.23s]  1.
[575.23s -> 576.23s]  Mark it.
[576.23s -> 577.23s]  2.
[577.23s -> 578.23s]  Mark it.
[578.23s -> 579.23s]  Mark it.
[579.23s -> 581.11s]  2.
[581.11s -> 582.28s]  Mark it.
[582.28s -> 583.28s]  See?
[583.28s -> 584.28s]  Now, look what we've deduced as a classroom.
[584.28s -> 585.28s]  This is 4 1s.
[585.28s -> 587.68s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[587.68s -> 589.44s]  Nowhere else they can go, ladies and gentlemen.
[589.44s -> 592.73s]  Please you mark them if you could on your worksheet.
[592.73s -> 595.53s]  Opened up some more interesting stuff, as you can see.
[595.53s -> 598.27s]  Now we have another row to work with, as it seems.
[598.27s -> 600.27s]  So again, this is 1.
[600.27s -> 601.27s]  1!
[601.27s -> 603.66s]  Mark that on your paper, please.
[603.66s -> 606.50s]  There's now only 1 more 1 somewhere here.
[606.50s -> 607.50s]  I don't know that yet.
[609.46s -> 610.46s]  What's this look like?
[610.46s -> 611.46s]  There's another 1.
[611.46s -> 614.88s]  Mark that on your sheet, please.
[614.88s -> 616.31s]  This is a 6.
[616.31s -> 617.31s]  See?
[617.31s -> 618.31s]  1.
[618.31s -> 619.31s]  6 is next in line.
[619.31s -> 622.39s]  It has to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[622.39s -> 624.40s]  And there's your 1.
[624.40s -> 625.40s]  1, 6, 1.
[625.40s -> 626.40s]  Done.
[626.40s -> 627.40s]  2, 1, 2.
[627.40s -> 630.40s]  There's another 1, 6, 1 over here.
[630.40s -> 633.40s]  And I think it's the same thing.
[633.40s -> 638.68s]  Which it is.
[638.68s -> 639.68s]  You get it?
[639.68s -> 642.68s]  Hey, past the snow.
[642.68s -> 644.86s]  Mr. Smith!
[645.38s -> 646.81s]  Oh!
[646.81s -> 648.81s]  You're handing out notes in class, are you?
[648.81s -> 649.81s]  Very interesting.
[649.81s -> 651.37s]  Give me that.
[651.37s -> 652.37s]  Give me that!
[653.37s -> 654.37s]  What's it say?
[658.13s -> 661.13s]  Mr. Albertson is a dickhead.
[666.02s -> 667.02s]  You know?
[667.02s -> 668.84s]  Okay.
[668.84s -> 669.84s]  Yeah.
[669.84s -> 671.27s]  You know what?
[671.27s -> 672.83s]  You know what, Mr. Smith?
[672.83s -> 674.58s]  That shows gumption.
[674.58s -> 676.58s]  You just got yourself a promotion.
[676.58s -> 679.27s]  You just got yourself a promotion.
[679.27s -> 682.64s]  Good luck in the 7th grade.
[682.64s -> 683.64s]  You're going up a whole grade.
[683.64s -> 688.19s]  I'm gonna call the office.
[688.71s -> 689.71s]  Head down.
[689.71s -> 692.27s]  They'll get you your new textbooks and your new classes and everything.
[692.27s -> 694.27s]  That shows management skills.
[694.27s -> 695.27s]  That shows drive.
[695.27s -> 696.27s]  You're going up a whole.
[696.27s -> 703.20s]  You're going up a grade.
[703.20s -> 704.20s]  All right.
[704.20s -> 705.20s]  Stop distracting me.
[705.20s -> 707.72s]  What am I doing?
[707.72s -> 709.28s]  Okay.
[709.28s -> 710.28s]  2.
[710.28s -> 711.28s]  This is...
[711.28s -> 712.65s]  Oh!
[712.65s -> 714.66s]  Oh!
[714.66s -> 715.66s]  Class!
[715.66s -> 716.66s]  Give me one second here.
[716.66s -> 718.60s]  I would like for you to understand.
[718.60s -> 720.23s]  We've got a 5 and a 1.
[720.23s -> 721.23s]  Where's the 5 go?
[721.23s -> 726.69s]  Where do you think that goes?
[726.69s -> 728.44s]  It goes right there.
[728.44s -> 729.44s]  Would you look at that?
[729.44s -> 732.94s]  So you get it.
[732.94s -> 737.16s]  That's 2.
[739.91s -> 740.91s]  Okay.
[740.91s -> 742.34s]  This is done.
[742.34s -> 746.02s]  The reason why you put the X's there is because it's really easy to fuck up and forget where
[746.02s -> 750.05s]  a space needs to be.
[750.05s -> 751.05s]  Very cool.
[751.05s -> 752.05s]  This one is just 5.
[752.05s -> 753.05s]  Fill it in.
[753.05s -> 754.55s]  This one's done too.
[754.55s -> 758.58s]  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[758.58s -> 759.58s]  This is cool.
[759.58s -> 760.58s]  So add those up.
[760.58s -> 762.58s]  2 plus the space 3.
[762.58s -> 765.58s]  4, 5, 6, 7 plus the space 8.
[765.58s -> 770.08s]  9, 10.
[770.08s -> 772.86s]  Get it?
[772.86s -> 773.86s]  No.
[773.86s -> 774.86s]  I didn't want to press that.
[774.86s -> 775.86s]  I wanted to press the...
[775.86s -> 776.86s]  I gotta remember what that is.
[776.86s -> 777.86s]  B is the...
[777.86s -> 778.86s]  I'm gonna screw that up all the time.
[779.66s -> 787.67s]  Okay, so this is done.
[787.67s -> 788.67s]  One has to be there.
[788.67s -> 789.67s]  This is also...
[789.67s -> 793.87s]  This would be done right now.
[793.87s -> 794.87s]  This is probably...
[794.87s -> 795.87s]  This is 3 right here.
[795.87s -> 804.34s]  It's a gum on the bottom of the desk.
[804.34s -> 807.48s]  That shit's disgusting.
[807.48s -> 810.44s]  Looking underneath the desk in a classroom was always just...
[810.44s -> 814.00s]  That's fucking gross.
[814.00s -> 820.32s]  Just wads of gum stuck there.
[820.32s -> 825.50s]  I would never want to put my hand underneath the desk and like push up and touch somebody
[825.50s -> 826.50s]  else's gum potentially.
[826.50s -> 829.28s]  That's...
[829.28s -> 830.58s]  That's awful.
[830.58s -> 831.58s]  Keep going.
[831.58s -> 836.92s]  Ooh, this is gonna be a chunky one.
[836.92s -> 843.28s]  Look at this.
[843.28s -> 844.28s]  That's a chunky one.
[844.28s -> 847.56s]  I always love when you get two rows.
[847.56s -> 849.89s]  When you get a full row removed.
[849.89s -> 850.89s]  That feels good too.
[850.89s -> 851.89s]  How do we make Picross the new stream meta?
[851.89s -> 852.89s]  That's an interesting thought.
[852.89s -> 856.56s]  You're playing easy levels.
[856.56s -> 857.56s]  I'm just getting...
[857.56s -> 867.89s]  I haven't played this in a long time.
[867.89s -> 868.89s]  Picross Tournament.
[868.89s -> 873.40s]  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

[1572.79s -> 1582.40s]  Okay. Okay. Very good. Very good.
[1582.40s -> 1595.46s]  Aha! Ha ha! Spider or pumpkin?
[1595.46s -> 1608.01s]  This one is going to be tricky I think. 6, 7, 8.
[1608.01s -> 1613.38s]  So if there's six it has to be these middle ones and be filled in because obviously you
[1613.38s -> 1619.58s]  go one two three four five six one two three four five six and there's no mathematical
[1619.58s -> 1625.66s]  way that it those cannot be filled in.
[1625.66s -> 1635.07s]  One two three four five six seven eight nine oh it's either here and then forward or starting
[1635.07s -> 1636.07s]  here and then forward.
[1636.07s -> 1637.07s]  I just don't know.
[1637.07s -> 1641.62s]  Don't you wish you were playing Elden Ring?
[1641.62s -> 1644.54s]  I mean I don't need to wish for much longer I'm gonna be playing it soon.
[1645.10s -> 1661.27s]  Or this one's gonna be tricky because look it can be this one one one two three one right
[1661.27s -> 1669.89s]  oh I I didn't mean to do that but I was getting it right okay just like I said you got that
[1669.89s -> 1688.75s]  wrong this is the correct place for it to be although I know it now three two all right
[1688.75s -> 1689.75s]  that helps.
[1689.75s -> 1707.35s]  It's playing a wordle a wordle this is I would assume this is the two it has to be yeah.
[1707.35s -> 1718.28s]  Oh that's a big deal one two three four it helps and we know this can't be part of the
[1718.28s -> 1735.63s]  three because three doesn't fit there that helps too so can't do any more with that.
[1735.63s -> 1740.43s]  No this was this was cool before wordle I'm a hipster I like things that people don't
