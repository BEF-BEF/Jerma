[35.45s -> 53.00s]  Hey, what's up? How's it going? We missed you. I was live yesterday for very long. How's it going?
[53.72s -> 63.77s]  You're quiet? I don't know. Shouldn't nothing change. I mean, I might be talking lower. I'm
[63.77s -> 71.22s]  screaming and yelling like I was yesterday. Yesterday was a wild one. I'm gonna slow it down
[71.22s -> 81.56s]  today. Play some trip hang. Am I saying trip hang 2? Is it trip hang 2? Trip hang 2? Trip hang 2.
[85.38s -> 95.62s]  Is there a trip hang 1? I played the demo a long time ago. Back, what, like 6 months ago? Is there a trip hang 1?
[96.18s -> 106.98s]  The demo was crazy. The demo was a lot of fun. So I said when it came out I was gonna play it and
[107.86s -> 120.76s]  here it is. It's out. Hey, what do you mean that the game is quite violent? Uh, this game is quite
[120.76s -> 129.66s]  violent. That's pretty much all I need to say. Because, uh, I think it's pretty bloody. Violent
[129.66s -> 143.19s]  game. If I remember the demo, the demo was, uh, was, uh, was outrageous. It's like fear. Yeah,
[143.19s -> 150.98s]  I played the demo. How the sunflowers. We're gonna go over a few things. I did say that I wanted to
[150.98s -> 158.26s]  show the sunflowers today, but, sorry, uh, not gonna show them today. I know people were waiting
[158.26s -> 164.17s]  for this. I said Sunday was gonna be the sunflower day, but I want to make sure these photos look
[164.17s -> 168.63s]  really good. Holly and I want to edit them, make them look nice.
[169.67s -> 174.39s]  And I don't just want to throw up a random shit picture. Like, oh, yeah, like, oh, this one and
[174.39s -> 179.91s]  this one. No, we're gonna curate them and make them look really nice. And then we're gonna present
[179.91s -> 191.19s]  them. I'm also gonna go over the house flipper lineup of streamers. Uh, that stream is gonna
[191.19s -> 203.30s]  be really fun. Looking forward to it. Tuesday at one o'clock Pacific. Doing a stream where I get
[204.26s -> 209.14s]  tentatively because still there's maybe one or two people on this list that, um, you know,
[209.14s -> 216.46s]  depending on scheduling stuff, some people have stuff to do, but we'll see. I think it's gonna be
[216.46s -> 234.17s]  probably 10 to 12 people. Can you talk faster? No, I don't know. Tentative Andy. Is stir doing it?
[234.97s -> 240.73s]  Um, I don't know. Stir just might be there and just do one. I don't know. We don't have a formal
[240.73s -> 246.47s]  agreement that stir is actually making a house on Tuesday. He can, he's more than welcome to,
[246.47s -> 254.55s]  right? Like I said yesterday, uh, he's been formally invited and then formally uninvited
[254.55s -> 261.80s]  and then formally invited again. So yeah, if he wants to do it again, do you think that you
[261.80s -> 280.70s]  will take over the world one day? No, no God, no, no, no. If I take over the world, you mean like
[280.70s -> 290.49s]  have my own little farm somewhere and like raised chickens and goats and shit. Then yeah, then yeah,
[291.13s -> 311.05s]  that sounds nice. Like Thanos. Yeah, guys, like Thanos, no other person in any country, in any
[311.05s -> 318.49s]  form of media, no other person has, has had a farm before. Just Thanos, just the guy that snapped out
[318.49s -> 331.85s]  humanity. Only Thanos has done that. Nobody else has ever done that. Why do you, you quote him every
[331.85s -> 343.99s]  five seconds. I need to correct the record here. Maybe back in like 2019 or something, 2020,
[344.87s -> 351.75s]  maybe like 2021 when end game was really relevant, right? Like, oh, whatever. I don't even know what
[351.75s -> 366.89s]  year that movie came out in. So you did. Remember you reference end game for like five years straight.
[367.77s -> 378.50s]  So it was a big piece of media. That movie made like five trillion dollars. Okay. I'm going to
[378.50s -> 394.65s]  reference the popular media that comes out. It's like World of Warcraft. Yeah, I reference World of
[394.65s -> 401.13s]  Warcraft a lot. It was a major, major part of my life and it was like a cultural phenomenon.
[402.73s -> 406.73s]  I'm going to reference it sometime and I can already see the Batchesters and that's fine.
[407.69s -> 414.76s]  That's fine. But anyways, yeah. If you want to go over the list, I'm going to get this out of the
[414.76s -> 418.36s]  way so we can just play and hang out. It's going to be a chill night tonight. I'm going to hang out
[418.36s -> 426.63s]  and play for a little while. Okay. So the tentative list for the House Flipper Invitational. It's just
[426.63s -> 437.90s]  me. Nobody's involved. It's just me. Let's go over how this is going to work. I have to, I have to
[437.90s -> 447.54s]  stall, right? Each one of these people that I'm going to save right now on Tuesday at one o'clock
[448.52s -> 456.20s]  at the same time are all going to start making a house. They're using the same house.
[457.00s -> 464.44s]  It's the same template. They will not know what house it is until Tuesday at one. So there's not
[464.44s -> 467.64s]  going to be a scenario where it's like, oh, it's this house. I'm not going to give them any
[467.64s -> 476.60s]  opportunity. This list is a bunch of friends of people that you've recognized for years.
[477.24s -> 488.04s]  Maybe a couple of new faces you haven't seen on this channel. Maybe friends, friends, friends.
[488.04s -> 502.95s]  Yes, friends. Yeah, I got friends. Okay, here we go. We got Joel, Vinesauce Joel. Looking forward
[502.95s -> 517.96s]  to what Joel is going to come up with. We've got Seadog. Seadog. RT Game. RT. Vinny Vinesauce.
[521.86s -> 540.17s]  Poke. Poke will be joining us. Ludwig. Ludwig. Doug Doug. Italex. Italex is joining us on this
[540.17s -> 549.61s]  stream. And Connor Eats Pants. Those are the, those are the, that's the tentative list.
[550.65s -> 556.89s]  Possible one or two may be added. Still trying to figure it out. But it's going to,
[556.89s -> 579.32s]  it's going to be a hell of a stream. Dream Blunt Rotation. The other thing too is that,
[579.32s -> 583.00s]  so I was thinking about, okay, who, who do I think, who do I know that would actually want to do this?
[583.80s -> 591.00s]  And I asked all my friends, obviously. But the other thing is I don't want it to be too many
[591.00s -> 597.16s]  people because if it gets to be like 15, 20 different people, it's like, oh, we all,
[597.16s -> 602.52s]  you all have to give me tours of your fucking house. We'll be here for like seven hours.
[603.24s -> 609.56s]  But yeah, I think this, there might be another one or two people added.
[610.12s -> 615.14s]  Maybe somebody is like, yo, I can't do it on Tuesday. It's all good. That's the tentative list.
[616.31s -> 627.61s]  Still waiting on one or two confirmations. What is the prize for the winner?
[628.49s -> 644.06s]  Absolutely fucking, absolutely nothing. Absolutely zero. Nothing. But here's the thing.
[644.78s -> 654.60s]  You're going to be graded. It's not just, oh, make a house and whatever. And all these grades are
[654.60s -> 659.08s]  just, the grades are absolute horseshit guys. All right. This is not a real competition.
[659.08s -> 663.96s]  Can I, I got to make that really clear. This is not a real competition. We're just going to
[663.96s -> 669.18s]  fuck around for a few hours. You know, this is not a real competition. But if you want to know what
[669.18s -> 674.71s]  you're going to be graded on, I put a lot of thought into this. Contrary to popular belief,
[675.35s -> 691.16s]  the grading system is loud. Sorry, that was so loud. The grading system is going to be as follows.
[691.16s -> 699.78s]  It's going to be weighted, a 100 point scale from A plus to F. F is always 55 points. You cannot get,
[699.78s -> 707.40s]  you cannot go below 55 points in a certain category. Creativity is worth 35%. Complexity
[707.40s -> 714.55s]  and structure is worth 25%. Cleanliness is worth 15%. And philosophy is worth 15%. Now you're
[714.55s -> 722.63s]  probably wondering, that does not make 100% Jeremy. That's where you come in. Chat's grade
[722.63s -> 728.12s]  is going to be worth 10%. Because I know of like, some of you, like, like Stirr said, the person,
[728.12s -> 732.34s]  the person that makes the auto house, some of you guys are probably going to give an A plus to.
[732.34s -> 741.29s]  But I want to be the one that decides. What are you going to be doing while they're making their
[741.29s -> 750.12s]  houses? That's a great question. I haven't figured that out yet. It's only going to be like 60 to 80
[750.12s -> 754.82s]  minutes. So I don't know. It's possible. Maybe I'll just jump around and look and see what people
[754.82s -> 765.21s]  are doing. I'll do browser games. But yeah, everyone's going to have a slot. So people are
[765.21s -> 770.74s]  going to have about five to 10 minutes to do a tour. And this is where it can get pretty bloated,
[770.74s -> 775.08s]  right? If this is, I'm trying to think of, okay, who, who can I invite? I don't want to just,
[775.08s -> 778.28s]  and I don't want to invite a bunch of people and then have to take it back. Cause it's like,
[778.28s -> 785.19s]  oh shit, actually I invited too many people. And you know me, I don't really fucking know anybody
[785.19s -> 791.11s]  anyways. I know very, I, my circle on, on Twitch and in the kind of content creator world is
[791.11s -> 801.72s]  actually fairly small. So, you know, I try to include as many people as I can, if I can. But
[801.72s -> 816.47s]  yeah, it's going to be a fun day. You're actually lying? Wait, what? What are you lying about? This
[817.51s -> 824.87s]  stream is not happening? No, what? This stream is happening. I've, I got, I got a whole document
[824.87s -> 832.76s]  about this stream. Okay. But anyways, yeah, we're going to grade. Well, I'm going to grade and then
[832.76s -> 838.73s]  you're going to give the ending grade and whoever wins and loses. It doesn't matter. It's all for
[838.73s -> 843.91s]  fun. Anyways, this whole thing is for fun. I made sure to tell everybody like, Hey, this whole thing
[843.91s -> 855.14s]  is just horse shit. Just everybody should know that they're talking about how you promised to
[855.14s -> 863.10s]  finish breath of the wild. Oh, they're talking about something else. You're wasting everybody's
[863.10s -> 868.98s]  time. What? You can't just have fun. Not everything has to, what do you mean? We can't, we can't just
[868.98s -> 884.70s]  have. All right. That's a bait comment. That's a bait comment. You didn't even let me trickle in
[884.70s -> 894.46s]  first. Uh, well, it's been like 15 minutes. Yeah, it should be fun. And again, that list might grow
[894.46s -> 899.82s]  by one or two. It might also reduce by one. Like I said, but that's just a tentative list. I wanted
[899.82s -> 905.82s]  to wait to tell everybody that because give people time to figure out if they can do it or not. Yeah,
[905.82s -> 922.79s]  we'll see. We will see. It's going to be fun. What the fuck are the stream tags? I have not
[922.79s -> 929.27s]  typed in a stream tag ever. So whatever's there, I don't know. I didn't even do it. One of the mods
[929.27s -> 936.57s]  just did it. They're like to fuck with me. You should delete them. I honestly, I don't even care
[936.57s -> 943.03s]  enough to delete them. Is that, you know what I mean? I could go over here right now to the dashboard
[943.03s -> 947.45s]  because on my other monitor, I have my dashboard and I can, I'm hovering over one of the X's for
[947.45s -> 953.98s]  tournament arc. I could click the X right now. I could do it right now. But the effort to click
[953.98s -> 963.14s]  that X is just not enough in here. I mean, I just don't even, you know, I can't do it. I just, I
[963.14s -> 972.70s]  don't care. But of the people that I mentioned there, I'm very curious as to, because there's
[972.70s -> 980.22s]  one of two ways to take that stream on Tuesday and that's going all in and doing house additions and
[980.22s -> 986.26s]  putting up custom wallpaper and shit and doing a full redecoration of the house. And then there's
[986.26s -> 989.62s]  like, I imagine some of them just going to put like a nice couch in a living room and like put
[989.62s -> 994.87s]  a painting up and maybe not even paint the walls and just be like, hey, what do you think? It's
[994.87s -> 1006.97s]  going to ask. I'm very, very excited about this. I think this is going to be really, really fun.
[1006.97s -> 1013.91s]  Last time Ludwig tried. Ludwig, I'm, I don't know if I would, I think Ludwig is going to make a
[1013.91s -> 1025.32s]  pretty good one. Ludwig has experience because if you don't, we did this on Ludwig's bros versus
[1025.32s -> 1034.34s]  bros, bro versus bro. So Ludwig has experience. Conradepants also has experience because he was
[1034.34s -> 1040.66s]  the one that graded it last time. So, and there's also a lot of people on this list have played a
[1040.66s -> 1047.91s]  lot of house flipper. That was part of my decision too, was have they played this before? Hmm. There
[1047.91s -> 1066.70s]  are some house flipper veterans that are on this list. When is this Tuesday at 1 PM Pacific? Are
[1066.70s -> 1071.51s]  you going to make a house? I don't, I don't know. I might just mess around in house flipper for the
[1071.51s -> 1094.79s]  60 to 80 minutes that people make a house. What the fuck is a Tuesday? All right. You guys ready?
[1094.79s -> 1101.46s]  Let's play. Uh, going to be just hanging out playing the game. Yesterday was kind of wild.
[1101.46s -> 1107.50s]  I'm going to dial it back a little today. What about Stirr? Stirr, that's what I mean by this.
[1107.50s -> 1111.50s]  Still a few people that I'm not sure if they're going to do it or not. Stirr is just one of them.
[1111.50s -> 1116.49s]  Stirr might just jump into the discord call and just be like, hey, I made one. And he's like,
[1116.49s -> 1129.06s]  okay, well, I'm going to grade it. You starting at 1 PM on a Tuesday is never going to happen.
[1129.06s -> 1136.01s]  Well, when there's 11 to 14 different streamers that are going to all be there at that time,
[1136.01s -> 1141.29s]  I better fucking be there because it's, it's my event. So if I'm not there, that's a big problem.
[1142.66s -> 1151.00s]  That would be bad. So I have to be there at 1 PM Pacific time. When like 10 to 15, like,
[1151.00s -> 1155.08s]  it's going to be like probably 12, maybe 11. It might be 14 though. It might be like 15. I
[1155.08s -> 1164.70s]  don't know. It's going to be, it's going to be a lot of people going to be late to your own event.
[1164.70s -> 1169.42s]  Yeah. Stirr's house could be the waiting house while you're waiting for other streamers.
[1169.59s -> 1177.99s]  That's actually not a bad idea. Are we going to, am I going to have to send a DM to Stirr to do
[1177.99s -> 1184.36s]  another five nights at Freddy's stream where he just discord shares me him making a house for like
[1184.36s -> 1191.98s]  an hour and he's not even being graded on it. I would just like watch him play the game and then
[1191.98s -> 1195.82s]  he'll just leave. He'll just leave after that. He'd be like, all right, I'm out of here. And
[1195.82s -> 1209.19s]  he'll just leave the call. He doesn't even care to be like a part of the festivities. So you're not
[1209.19s -> 1216.58s]  even streaming the, oh no. Yes, I am. I am. So how it's going to play out is after the hour goes by,
[1216.58s -> 1222.92s]  each person is going to have a, about a seven minute time slot and they're going to share to
[1222.92s -> 1230.09s]  me their screen and we are going to go through a tour. They're going to give me a full tour
[1230.09s -> 1239.26s]  and I'm going to be taking notes stalling. Well, I mean, this is an important stall. This is a,
[1239.26s -> 1245.59s]  this is, this is the big house flipper event I've been talking about the last few weeks.
[1245.59s -> 1253.11s]  I think it's an important stall. This game can be pretty loud even if you lower the volume.
[1253.11s -> 1260.68s]  That is great for me to know because I will drop it even further. Thank you.
[1260.68s -> 1275.32s]  All right, let's go. Trapang 2. Here it is. New game. Uh, I, I'm not picking rage mode.
[1275.32s -> 1281.61s]  Hold on. What is this? Easy? Have some casual fun. We won't judge. Oh. Recommended difficulty
[1281.61s -> 1286.97s]  players who occasionally play FPS games. Recommended for experienced FPS players looking
[1286.97s -> 1293.94s]  for a challenge. What about experienced FPS players that are not looking for a challenge?
[1293.94s -> 1302.42s]  How come there's not a normal plus? Uh, punishingly difficult. You will die a lot.
[1302.50s -> 1307.06s]  Ridiculously difficult. Expert mastery of the game's mechanics and exploits are required to
[1307.06s -> 1311.74s]  play on this difficulty. And then enemies have eyes in the back of their heads.
[1311.74s -> 1318.07s]  Instant reaction times and near perfect accuracy. Only some kind of sick and twisted person could
[1318.07s -> 1335.69s]  enjoy this. I was playing on normal. I don't care. What the hell? All right. Double headphones going
[1335.69s -> 1351.03s]  in. Normal. Omega low. Yeah, that's fine though. I've said this before. When you're over 35,
[1351.03s -> 1355.14s]  you can pick normal. It's fine. You can pick normal even if it doesn't matter how old you are.
[1356.82s -> 1385.53s]  Stop judging people for playing video games the way that they like to. No audio. I'll turn it up.
[1386.17s -> 1402.33s]  This is me. Face cam. We've been good. No, not today. Not today. No face cam. We're in the
[1402.33s -> 1414.78s]  chill zone right now. All right. Well, it actually is kind of loud. Still. Can you do a nose cam?
[1414.78s -> 1428.18s]  No. Did I just get shot in the head? That'd be so funny if it just started like that.
[1429.66s -> 1444.82s]  Audio is fine. I can see it over here. This needs to be changed though. 60% for everything.
[1444.82s -> 1457.83s]  Yeah, this is fine. Maybe turn the effects down. Bring this up. Bring the master volume up. Right?
[1457.83s -> 1470.10s]  Two cheats. I need to play the game first. Producer Andy. Here we go. This needs to be much
[1470.74s -> 1477.50s]  like six maybe. You still have a beard? No, it got way too hot. I had to shave it.
[1480.92s -> 1498.30s]  All right, here we go. Wait, the physics even work when you walk? What do I just do? Can I pick that
[1498.30s -> 1513.93s]  up? Have you seen the giant LED ball in Vegas? That thing is fucking crazy. You know what I'm
[1513.93s -> 1527.35s]  looking forward to? I'm looking forward to when that becomes a giant snow globe in the winter.
[1527.35s -> 1545.22s]  It can be anything. Is there a sprint? That has to change immediately. Input. That needs to be E is
[1546.42s -> 1563.64s]  where is it? Cloak. Okay, we'll do cloak F and then interact as E. Oh, there is no sprint.
[1564.28s -> 1575.77s]  Oh my god. They were moving way faster. It's getting ready. It wants to do it.
[1576.41s -> 1587.18s]  The dot appears in the center of the screen when you were in shadow. Oh, so the dot means that I
[1587.18s -> 1593.88s]  can't be seen. Do they have audio devices? Do they have organic audio devices on the sides of their
[1593.88s -> 1623.21s]  heads? Am I going to get spotted? You can be seen in the darkness. If they let you rent the sphere,
[1623.21s -> 1634.62s]  you should put an image of your face there. Oh yeah, this is your captain speaking. We're landing
[1634.62s -> 1639.58s]  in a nice beautiful sunny Las Vegas. If you look out your left window, you actually hear the strip
[1639.58s -> 1646.55s]  is in view as we're landing here. Take a look at the sphere today is the sus guy. I don't know if
[1646.55s -> 1663.70s]  any of you know who that is. Well, your answer to the question is no, I don't have like an extra
[1663.70s -> 1689.85s]  six million dollars. So no, sorry. Health pack, right? Why not? Is there a flashlight? Here we go.
[1689.85s -> 1709.27s]  Is it too loud? I have a feeling it's going to get very loud here in a second.
[1714.70s -> 1721.94s]  I just looked at the you're tripping. Am I? I feel like it's going to go loud. Just be aware.
[1721.94s -> 1744.78s]  It's probably going to get loud. Locked. He said rage mode has a warning if you click it.
[1753.53s -> 1757.69s]  Rage mode is insanely difficult. Basically anything will kill you instantly. It is not
[1757.69s -> 1762.97s]  recommended unless you have a minimum of 50 hours spent in the game. Our publisher even
[1762.97s -> 1772.94s]  asked us to remove this mode. Are you absolutely sure you want to proceed? Oh my God. That's so
[1772.94s -> 1779.03s]  funny. All right, so I got a gun. Let's do a shoot test to see how loud this is.
[1783.43s -> 1791.02s]  That's it's all right. I might need to drop the sensitivity a little more.
[1796.89s -> 1811.94s]  Maybe five. All right, let's go. Oh my God. Okay, that's going to freak me out. I'm going to keep
[1811.94s -> 1825.70s]  things behind me. It's an autosave. That's good. There's a jump. Cool. Jump and melee to do a
[1825.70s -> 1834.09s]  powerful kick. Oh, that's right. There's a big, there's a big jumping kick. What did I just hit?
[1836.30s -> 1848.90s]  I just broke my leg. Did you really just say there's a jump? Cool. Slide is alt. I think I
[1848.90s -> 1871.24s]  want to change that. What does Q do? I think I want Q is slide. What is Q? Focus. Alt for me is
[1871.24s -> 1876.04s]  weird because I have to take my hands off of, um, my thumb is like in a weird spot. I'll try it.
[1876.04s -> 1883.75s]  Middle mouse is not a bad one either, but I'll try it as it is because I'm going to hit the windows
[1883.75s -> 1888.81s]  key. Yeah, now I'm going to change it. Now I always hit the windows key if alt needs to be pressed a
[1888.81s -> 1895.05s]  lot. So let's change it. Let's make it something else. You press using your thumb. What do you
[1895.13s -> 1910.41s]  mean? Would you use something else besides your thumb? I know what to do. Watch this. Mouse four
[1910.41s -> 1916.66s]  for slide. Sounds pretty good. And then where's grenade? Grenade is going to be mouse. Uh,
[1919.37s -> 1930.46s]  mouse five. Let's try that. Yeah, that's much better. That's great. Pick up Intel site 14
[1930.46s -> 1950.38s]  security message log. Read it. Cool. Well, actually do I need to know this? Cool. All right,
[1950.38s -> 1966.12s]  let's go. This is a stamina bar. This is locked. There is a flashlight. Oh,
[1966.12s -> 1970.58s]  enemies can see the flashlight. This was the demo, wasn't it? I remember playing this in the demo.
[1977.82s -> 1991.70s]  He's so high right now. I'm not. We're just enjoying video game. Is this game like fear?
[1991.70s -> 2023.42s]  It has been compared to fear. Yes. Checking on the tunnel. Who's he shooting at? He just
[2023.42s -> 2060.86s]  shooting at his friend. They know where I am. Got him. Slide. Wait, somebody, somebody over here.
[2065.75s -> 2075.56s]  We're both stupid. We can't even hit each other. Oh yeah, that's right. I forgot.
[2075.56s -> 2107.51s]  I forgot you could do this. Is he dead? Wait, did I come this way? Wait, did I come this way?
[2108.15s -> 2126.25s]  I think I can this way. Okay. Um, this is where I just bought everybody. Where's the goal?
[2128.63s -> 2135.64s]  It's concrete. I don't know where I'm going. Uh, that's a rule on this channel. If, if the,
[2135.96s -> 2151.86s]  the walls are all concrete, I don't know where I'm going. I actually don't know if everything,
[2151.86s -> 2161.83s]  if the walls are gray, I'm not going to know where I'm going ever. If you're wondering why
[2161.83s -> 2166.47s]  game companies made the, for you to go like it hit the side of your head with your finger
[2166.47s -> 2172.87s]  and a line goes on the ground, it's because of me. Blame me. It's all my fault. It's my fault.
[2172.87s -> 2186.65s]  I'm the one that they do that for. Cause I shot and fought people in here. Is there a map? Uh,
[2186.65s -> 2192.44s]  I don't, maybe not yet. I'm sorry. I'm reading chat too. So the, the walls are concrete. I'm
[2192.44s -> 2203.98s]  looking over a chat every 10 seconds. Is this right? Going the yellow doors. Dude, you're going
[2203.98s -> 2243.51s]  backwards. Yellow door and then up. And that wasn't I just up here? Kick the red doors. Okay. I, I
[2243.51s -> 2270.09s]  found it. Oh, she that scared the shit out of me. Oh my God. Wait, that guy's a different gun.
[2274.17s -> 2301.90s]  There's no aim down sights. There, there's the slow down. Cool. I have full health, but on hard.
[2301.90s -> 2309.50s]  I might, I might, I might. Okay. You don't have to be sprinting to the, to the slide. That's,
[2309.50s -> 2350.34s]  that's cool. Shotgun. Ooh. Yeah. I, I always pick the shotgun. Intel. Where are they? Oh my God.
[2358.87s -> 2364.71s]  God, this is violent. This is a violent game by the way. Wow. That was loud. I can't see
[2364.71s -> 2391.29s]  anything. All right. Flashlight off. What's all over my gun? The oil. This is blood. It's blood.
[2393.59s -> 2398.15s]  That looks like a CS go skin. There's so much blood and guts all over it.
[2398.15s -> 2427.13s]  That's like a factory new fucking bloodstained weapon. That guy exploded. My God. What the
[2427.77s -> 2437.02s]  this guy live. What the fuck? That guy was climbing like Spider-Man on the wall.
[2444.81s -> 2462.81s]  Okay. That was crazy. Anything else in here? I'm going to have to get good pretty soon though.
[2462.81s -> 2469.27s]  There's a lot of things you can do with the slide. It seems sprinting costs stamina. Killing enemies
[2469.27s -> 2485.70s]  temporarily boost stamina. Okay. You're playing on baby mode. I might turn it up to hard baby mode
[2485.70s -> 2494.36s]  would be easy though. Actually you're laughing. People are exploding. I mean, it's, it's kind of
[2494.36s -> 2498.20s]  a wild thing going on in the screen that sometimes you don't know how to react to what's happening
[2498.20s -> 2515.67s]  in front of you. Geez. You know, there's a game mode you can turn on where it's confetti instead
[2515.67s -> 2520.57s]  of blood. I must want to turn it on for a little bit. Let's do actually let's do it. I'm curious.
[2520.57s -> 2551.02s]  I want to see what it does. Confetti pyro mode pyro vision. Yeah. I still might need to turn the
[2551.02s -> 2580.28s]  sensitivity down. Are we supposed to recognize this person? Oh, a big token. Can you take the
[2580.28s -> 2605.80s]  sword? I guess you can't take the sword. What the hell was that? They would definitely hear that.
[2605.80s -> 2622.36s]  There's nobody back here. Don't mind that. What just happened to the wall? The wall just,
[2622.36s -> 2643.93s]  that was weird. I got all ammo. Uh, let's go shotgun. What just happened?
[2650.02s -> 2653.70s]  I thought that guy was me for a second. Can I take a second just to understand?
[2654.50s -> 2658.50s]  I thought I pulled out into third person mode somehow and that that was me in the room.
[2667.34s -> 2674.42s]  The confetti is funny. I want to get one more person with the confetti and then we're good.
[2681.18s -> 2731.51s]  Wait. Secrets. No. Keep it on. Okay. I'm going to try to melee kill. Let's go. Turn up the FOV.
[2731.51s -> 2746.82s]  I think it's at 90. Fast movement and nauseous. Uh, is that 90? Should I go higher than 90? 100?
[2746.82s -> 2762.78s]  Go 110. Let's try 110. Oh, that is a little better. Okay. Also, I want to put the, let's
[2762.78s -> 2774.04s]  put this back on. Turn v-sync off. Turn v-sync off. Turn v-sync off. Turn v-sync off. Look sorry
[2774.04s -> 2796.60s]  for me. Oh my God. That guy just tried to do a roundhouse kick to me. That guy just roundhouse
[2796.60s -> 2812.07s]  kicked me in the head. We're going a little bit, we're going a little bit lower on the sensitivity.
[2812.07s -> 2830.87s]  Let's go. I don't have any throwables. No grenades. Did that screen shake? I turned the screen shake
[2830.87s -> 2843.29s]  off. I feel like I'm trying to score like a touchdown. Like, oh, he's got the ball. He's
[2843.29s -> 2880.39s]  jumping over the offensive line. Oh my God. Turn the difficulty up. Let's try it. Watch me die in
[2880.39s -> 2900.63s]  one hit now. Oh, what's up? I thought the chair was a person. Oh, I got grenades now. Grenades
[2900.63s -> 2907.56s]  explode on impact. All right. We're going to have to make this work. Use silenced weapons
[2907.56s -> 2925.19s]  to shoot out lights. Wait, where was there a silenced weapon? Oh, uh, go in complete darkness.
[2925.19s -> 2983.06s]  Get out of here. Oh my God. Who else? Who else? Geez. That guy killed himself too.
[2992.07s -> 2999.80s]  All right. This time, let me not do what I just did because I, I thought whatever. All right. I'm
[2999.80s -> 3017.77s]  got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Any more lights? Forget about all the noise in the moving
[3017.77s -> 3060.95s]  chair and desk over here. What? I'm just staying down. Got him. Oh, all right. I got a cloak too.
[3060.95s -> 3067.42s]  I got to use the cloak more often. I am just breaking everything I touch. Stop. What the
[3067.42s -> 3106.84s]  fuck? How do you miss when you're invisible? Open the fucking door. Open this. Open the door.
[3107.56s -> 3134.10s]  Give me all right. What do you got? All right. I got a good spot here. Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm taking
[3134.10s -> 3166.73s]  this. Give me this thing. Weapon part acquired laser. Ooh, customized weapon. Ah, um, that's kind
[3166.73s -> 3196.09s]  of cool. Enemies can see the laser. I'm ready to take the other part. There's another part.
[3196.09s -> 3222.78s]  I missed a part. Where was this other weapon part? Oh, it's the briefcase. Okay. I thought it was
[3222.78s -> 3240.42s]  ammo. Can I put two suppressors on this? So it's like a big long end of the barrel.
[3240.42s -> 3252.47s]  Bolded stock, higher recoil, but slightly faster reload times. I'll keep that. Can I put the
[3252.47s -> 3260.31s]  suppressor on the shotgun? Why do people compare this to fear? I just got her. I don't notice it.
[3260.31s -> 3264.86s]  I think it's mainly the slowdown mechanic. First person shooter slowdown mechanic.
[3266.55s -> 3287.72s]  Lots of, you know, crazy physics shit happening. How would you even see me? Oh my God. I'm
[3287.72s -> 3317.27s]  invisible. I'm invisible. I'm invisible. Got them. Oh, those aren't lasers aiming down the hallway.
[3318.55s -> 3324.20s]  I thought those were laser sites. That's just my vision doing that. What? It is lasers. What the
[3324.20s -> 3339.56s]  fuck? It is lasers. What? It is lasers. I, I, okay. I promise I haven't taken any fucking edibles
[3339.56s -> 3367.26s]  today. I thought it was just these doing that. Okay. Well, can I get in here? I don't want him
[3367.26s -> 3398.36s]  to see. The fuck is that? Oh, this is a good guy. Subject 106. Accessing user memories.
[3398.36s -> 3406.22s]  Successful uploading. Subject 105 termination. Upload complete. Incoming message. The cycle begins
[3406.22s -> 3426.12s]  again. Capture means you will be forced to complete your original mission. Exiting program. What the
[3426.12s -> 3444.84s]  heck? Where is my health? Just lower right. I remember this room. This is the crazy room from
[3444.84s -> 3471.53s]  the demo. Fuck. Get everything quick. Supermarkets sweep this shit right now. What the fuck?
[3476.41s -> 3482.41s]  I slide tackled that guy's helmet off. I tried to fucking hit melee him. I tried to melee him.
[3483.75s -> 3486.55s]  Oh my God. Okay. I'm going to, I got to run. I'm going to die.
[3503.35s -> 3517.22s]  What's that guy doing? He's still alive. Quick, quick, quick. More, more, more stuff.
[3517.22s -> 3539.90s]  Why did the, why did the grenade take so long to go off?
[3558.39s -> 3566.81s]  What? Is he still alive? Is he still alive? You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[3568.50s -> 3593.58s]  That was fucking crazy. Uh, no, wait. There's another door. Where is this one? All right.
[3593.58s -> 3624.89s]  Fuck face. This game is great by the way. This is wonderful. Wait, can I, hold on.
[3625.53s -> 3670.02s]  I, I need, okay. Here we go. Oh shit. Oh my God. It's right behind me. Oh man.
[3672.12s -> 3690.28s]  How the fuck? Oh my goodness gracious. Can they see me? Hey, stop firing. I got your friend right
[3690.28s -> 3703.02s]  here. Stop firing. Stop firing. I got your buddy right here. Stop firing. Okay. Nevermind.
[3703.02s -> 3735.75s]  Let's go. Okay. Where are they coming out? In there. Fuck you. Like a fucking cockroach.
[3735.75s -> 3739.51s]  I'm just like impossible to get like tilt. It's just like there. Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
[3739.51s -> 3753.34s]  Did it go behind the couch? I don't believe that spider go. I don't know. I'm dead. Okay.
[3760.07s -> 3766.70s]  You play like a rat would play. Yeah. That's what I mean. It's just like,
[3767.66s -> 3786.26s]  I'm like a squirrel that got in the room. What the hell? Why did a fucking bomb just go off?
[3786.26s -> 3798.68s]  How come I can't do my slow down anymore? It's in a queue. Did they take it away from me?
[3820.04s -> 3827.53s]  I have to fucking try to do this. Oh, I have like no ammo. All right. All right. All right.
[3827.53s -> 3830.97s]  All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm having too much fun being a fucking weirdo.
[3855.48s -> 3866.44s]  Oh, fuck. Okay. This is hard. So I said the assault rifle is terrible.
[3866.44s -> 3872.57s]  This is a gug at a game. You shouldn't be standing still. I, yeah, I know, but I need to,
[3872.57s -> 3878.57s]  I don't have any charge. I'm going to turn the brightness up as well too. All right. Hold on.
[3881.43s -> 3896.15s]  Why did I just pick this up? There's too many of them. There's too many of them.
[3896.79s -> 3906.81s]  That guy's covered in our armor. Get away from me with that thing on your back.
[3906.81s -> 3908.97s]  Get away from me with that thing on your back. Get away from me with that thing on your back.
[3909.61s -> 3944.58s]  I ran into fucking bullets. I'm just going this way. Fuck it. No, give me that. Blow up already.
[3944.58s -> 3985.96s]  God damn it. Holy shit, dude. Oh my God. Somebody help me. Oh, no. Give me your gun. Give me your
[3985.96s -> 4055.90s]  gun. Stop floating around. Stop. Oh my God. All right. Here we go. Close the door. What the fuck?
[4055.90s -> 4082.97s]  This guy's going to blow. Okay. I'm good. Was he alive? I thought he blew up. Hold on.
[4082.97s -> 4128.25s]  We get to go up a little bit higher. What the hell just happened? I got ammo. I got ammo.
[4128.25s -> 4152.36s]  What the fuck, dude? Dude, I just made popcorn. I didn't even fucking hurt the guy.
[4159.30s -> 4179.62s]  What the? Oh my. Okay. Can I put it down to normal for a second? Holy shit. This is crazy.
[4180.26s -> 4191.35s]  This is a boss fight. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm just going to sit right here
[4191.35s -> 4255.40s]  and I'm going to grab them when they get over here. Oh, fuck. Got it. Oh shit.
[4260.57s -> 4322.47s]  Okay. Got him. Where'd he go? No, don't die. Oh my God. One left. One left. One left. I got it. I
[4322.47s -> 4340.47s]  got it. I got it. I got it. Got him. Holy shit. That was fucking wild. 106 is approaching the
[4340.47s -> 4354.10s]  hell. I remember this part. I remember this is the demo and then I thought these were enemies.
[4355.22s -> 4361.56s]  I fucking shot this guy. We're going to get you out of here. Don't do that again. I killed this
[4361.56s -> 4373.51s]  guy. I thought they were not. I mean, after that, come on, do it again. Sorry. I did a lot of
[4373.51s -> 4381.56s]  screaming back there. It's time. I got to pull it back. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't. There's
[4381.56s -> 4404.36s]  an achievement. There are consequences. No, I'm not doing it. There was at least four or five voice
[4404.36s -> 4444.31s]  cracks during that as well and I'm very embarrassed by it. It happens to everybody. All right. I bet
[4444.31s -> 4477.43s]  you couldn't even point out where Tripp Hang is on a map. No, I couldn't. Okay.
[4477.51s -> 4493.54s]  So now that that's the kind of tutorial for zone, that's the demo. What do you do from here?
[4494.18s -> 4505.74s]  It's a very pretty game, I will say, and it runs really well. Something I think developers that
[4505.74s -> 4528.18s]  make games like this, it runs very well. It's like, it's pretty smooth. Do you have a 3090? Yeah. Is
[4528.18s -> 4535.66s]  it how is 3090 still considered like good? How much more powerful is the 4090 compared to the 3090?
[4535.66s -> 4551.82s]  Because I usually wait two or three generations. Should I wait till like the 5080 or like the 6090?
[4551.82s -> 4557.54s]  You don't stream in 1080p. Yeah. You know, that's going to change pretty soon here. The one thing
[4557.54s -> 4566.23s]  that sucks about having like a 1080p stream, the one thing I'm worried about is I just turning,
[4566.23s -> 4571.67s]  I would have to turn the bit rate up or I'd have to drop. I mean, maybe I'll just get like a
[4571.67s -> 4587.06s]  streaming PC or something. Which bit rate sucks anyways. Yeah. You have a 4090? No, I have 3090.
[4587.06s -> 4592.25s]  Do you play at 4k or 1080? If you're at 1080, you don't need more than a 3090.
[4592.25s -> 4600.57s]  Yeah, I don't play in. Well, hold on a second here. I do play in, this is, this is 4k, right?
[4600.57s -> 4615.16s]  Technically. Isn't that 4k? No? Wait, what is it? Two? What is it? 2k? That's not even 1440.
[4615.16s -> 4623.14s]  That's not even 1440. That's not even 1080p. Dude, that's better than 1080p. That's better than
[4623.14s -> 4642.42s]  1080p. Wait. Oh, oops. Okay. Now I'm playing in 1440p. Looks pretty good. Damn. Looks nice.
[4642.42s -> 4653.05s]  Yeah. That was a weird resolution. That's the kind of resolution that old, old games,
[4653.05s -> 4659.69s]  I remember like Warcraft 3, seeing some of those weird resolutions that they made for that game
[4659.69s -> 4667.85s]  that you could have for like probably eight people that had that monitor. All right. So
[4667.85s -> 4677.99s]  what do we do here? Cheats. Complete mission on hard. All right. So I have to beat all these
[4677.99s -> 4693.29s]  missions on hard and I get the cheats. Customize appearance. Oh, let's do that. Oh, hell yeah.
[4693.29s -> 4705.50s]  Okay. I mean, I got to go with the fucking red shoes. That's just a fact. Shirt I want to wear.
[4708.09s -> 4731.70s]  Can I see a preview? Whoa. Oh, these get kind of funky. All right. Let's go green. Green, woodland
[4733.27s -> 4750.09s]  and is there a green one here? Green. I got to go with the, we'll stay with the red. Cool. All right.
[4750.09s -> 4763.58s]  This is an awful drip. I'm not, I look there. I don't look somewhere. I'm like crocs. Combat
[4763.58s -> 4785.88s]  simulator. What's that? Should I do this? Oh, I just scared myself. All right. Where's the main
[4785.88s -> 4796.89s]  missionary over here? All right. Door Institute. We lost contact with our undercover agent in this
[4796.89s -> 4804.76s]  orazon. End of orazon. Like say the word correctly. Just do it. Prove that you can read that word.
[4804.76s -> 4832.52s]  Horizon. End of life care facility. Raid the facility and find him. I'm my own worst enemy
[4832.52s -> 4837.00s]  a lot of times because even if sometimes if I'm fucking around, it still doesn't matter.
[4837.00s -> 4855.34s]  Some of you will take away from this. Something's wrong with him. Can I take weapons or something?
[4855.34s -> 4930.18s]  I like this weapon. Tried. Tried what? This was testing the game. All right. Do I have a better
[4930.18s -> 4939.83s]  gun? I have a better gun to shoot that with. Dude, come on. I don't want to wait like another two
[4939.83s -> 4962.31s]  minutes before I can spawn again. All right. I got to disable that. Oh no. Look out. It's the guy
[4962.31s -> 4984.76s]  with the clown shoes. Grab him. Grab him. That guy's head was made out of glass. We shouldn't even
[4984.76s -> 5036.06s]  be fighting. You now. Go. Did he say hurry the fuck up? Where are they coming from? Oh, there he is.
[5036.06s -> 5152.34s]  Okay. Shotgun. Oh shit. Oh shit. Got him. Got him. Where'd he go? Yep. Oh, fucking. High value target.
[5152.34s -> 5172.54s]  Jackal. I almost shot the helicopter. What's in here? Ooh, breach charges. Now do I blow
[5172.54s -> 5228.54s]  the door? Oh, I like this song. It's dead. Oh, look out. Shoot out. Oh, in the room with the bottles.
[5228.54s -> 5278.81s]  Oh, oh, I'm in trouble here. Did he get pulled so fast? What sucked him down? He was magnetized.
[5278.81s -> 5317.66s]  Holy shit. Who else? I think we're clear. Can I go in here? Uh, where do I go from here? I came
[5317.66s -> 5353.54s]  through here. Um, the guy you threw was a, what do you mean? Earlier. I've thrown a lot of people
[5353.54s -> 5373.86s]  so far. Did I, I don't know where I threw that person. Did I throw in the pool? What about him?
[5373.86s -> 5404.65s]  The glass roof. Oh, okay. That was this way. Can I not go? How do I get out here? I don't think you
[5404.65s -> 5409.53s]  do. Wait, did I actually throw the guy? Did I need a key or something from the guy I threw over there?
[5412.07s -> 5425.05s]  That you mean over there? No, no, I don't think so. I think I just got on the wrong way. Wait,
[5425.05s -> 5445.50s]  really? Shoot all the glass? I don't think so. There's a breach charge. Uh, hold on. Keep going
[5445.50s -> 5482.20s]  up this event. Um, can I just? Yeah. Underground. Oh, wait a minute. The walls aren't concrete. You
[5482.20s -> 5487.00s]  don't have a, you don't have an excuse this time. Yep. I may have thrown the guy that had the item
[5487.00s -> 5491.64s]  I needed across the wall that I can't. Is it over there? That's a breach charge right there,
[5491.64s -> 5508.12s]  isn't it? Right there. That's a charge. Okay. Well, I'll just reload. Okay. We're good.
[5525.75s -> 5604.86s]  I'm all right. I'm going to fuck you up. All right. Where's the item? Let me in that room too.
[5604.86s -> 5620.39s]  Let me in that room. Oh, those are my friends. Shit. I'm sorry. Well, the grenade bounced off
[5620.39s -> 5642.92s]  the back of his head, so he's, he'll have a welt. He'll be okay. Ooh, I'll go with that. Any, uh,
[5642.92s -> 5678.26s]  customization options for the other stuff? Fold it up. Let's go. I need more gun parts. Whoa, dude.
[5678.26s -> 5720.60s]  Whoa, hold on. Nice. Ooh, what is that? That's a sniper rifle. You were the only person left, man.
[5725.21s -> 5734.33s]  I'm going to cover me. I got to get a no scope headshot. That's the only way I'll be happy.
[5772.79s -> 5788.33s]  Look at the DPS meters. He ain't doing shit. You all right? All right. We got to go in together
[5788.33s -> 5816.57s]  on with me and on me. One, two, three, go. Who's saying that? Oh, it's the radio.
[5818.06s -> 5822.62s]  I thought it was one of these guys. How's everybody doing tonight? We having fun or what?
[5835.70s -> 5842.82s]  You play video games like my dad, bro. I'm almost 40. All right. This is just the way it is. This is
[5842.82s -> 5847.54s]  how it's going to be going forward. And I'm sorry. This is the way it is.
[5860.23s -> 5909.94s]  He's here. He's trapped. What? No, I was going to stealth. There's one more person in here.
[5909.94s -> 5919.24s]  Yeah, whatever. Wait, this is, this is, somebody said this is Kickstarter.
[5919.24s -> 5940.34s]  Is it? Wait, what do you mean Kickstarter? Was this game a Kickstarter? You'll never beat me.
[5940.98s -> 5962.44s]  He just punched. That guy was jabbing me in the chin. Ooh, weapon parts, the presser.
[5964.95s -> 5976.65s]  What about the sniper rifle? Somebody's still here. Who is it? You? It's not you. Is it, man?
[5977.53s -> 5998.57s]  No way. Shotgun suppressor. I think that's the most counterintuitive,
[5998.57s -> 6005.72s]  counterproductive thing to put on a shotgun. Does this actually do anything? Does it actually
[6005.72s -> 6020.63s]  work? I feel like you can't suppress the sound of a shotgun. It makes it sound cool. This person's
[6020.63s -> 6028.57s]  been looking for me this whole time. Communicating on the radio. OK, let's, we have to examine this
[6028.57s -> 6053.67s]  guy for a little while. I wish there was a cough button. Is he in there? Is he in the what? No,
[6053.67s -> 6080.95s]  grab him. Is he in there? What do you mean mouse five grenade? Be careful here. That doesn't
[6080.95s -> 6092.62s]  consume your grenades, by the way. That's actually kind of crazy. I need more ammo. I'm for the boss
[6092.62s -> 6097.82s]  fight. I'm going to use the sniper rifle only. That's the boss killer weapon for sure. 100%.
[6116.55s -> 6161.38s]  I got one of those too. Yeah. Oh, that doesn't hurt you. It's just you two assholes left.
[6161.38s -> 6189.88s]  God damn it. How do I get rid of these guys? Oh, oh, these guys have got concrete bodies.
[6189.88s -> 6208.92s]  You didn't hear anything. Only they had a weak spot. Yeah, I shot the
[6209.74s -> 6219.53s]  fire extinguishers off their backs and they didn't die. I'm going to do this slow.
[6237.48s -> 6281.16s]  Why is he laughing at me? God blow up, blow up, please blow up, please. Oh, this guy.
[6281.88s -> 6288.33s]  Seriously, dude, the guys got a jet pack on now. Hold on, I got to take a sip of this.
[6288.33s -> 6302.20s]  Can you tackle them? I don't think those guys fall down if you tackle them too heavy.
[6302.20s -> 6339.43s]  All right. I'm just going in. Fuck it. Fuck everybody in this room. Watch out. I'm going to
[6339.43s -> 6345.66s]  hide in here for a sec. Oh my God. They get, they're going to get hit by those. They're going to be
[6345.66s -> 6358.49s]  stupid and they're going to walk into that. Watch this. What am I hitting in the way?
[6359.29s -> 6365.88s]  There ain't nothing in the way. What? You just aggroed more enemies.
[6367.32s -> 6379.78s]  All right. These guys are really hard. I got to kill those guys first. I thought he was going to
[6379.78s -> 6418.22s]  walk in and walk backwards and blow up. Okay. This one, I took that guy's helmet off too.
[6418.22s -> 6470.12s]  All right. We're good. Better. Oh my God. There we go. That's better. Show yourself.
[6470.12s -> 6493.83s]  That guy was just talking. Okay. He's dead. I need this health on them. No, I got,
[6493.83s -> 6501.75s]  I got a full recharge. I'm good. Is there any other ammo I can grab here though?
[6501.75s -> 6518.36s]  I feel like I need it bad. I guess I can just take this and run around. Does this help me?
[6518.36s -> 6528.02s]  Pistol's really good. The pistol does seem really good. Doesn't it? All right. I got enough.
[6528.02s -> 6573.59s]  Now don't die in here. Where's this guy? One more over there.
[6576.22s -> 6604.39s]  There's nowhere to go. Okay. Don't run around like that here. No way. I want to, why can I not?
[6604.39s -> 6619.77s]  I can't grab them. I was trying to grab them. Oh no. Charles. Oh no. What the hell was that?
[6619.77s -> 6638.90s]  Somebody rock across the tripwire. I, I don't know. All right. This is going to be hard now.
[6642.23s -> 6655.48s]  Who's here? Oh, I don't think I made out better than they did.
[6668.46s -> 6683.90s]  He's still alive. Oh my God. I thought that was the doorway. I thought that was the doorway.
[6690.81s -> 6695.13s]  I thought this was a hallway. I thought that was the ground and this was the wall.
[6705.70s -> 6716.47s]  Wiley Coyote bit. Yeah, seriously. Wait, there's still people here. Oh, that's the jackal. All
[6716.47s -> 6726.44s]  right. I got to be ready. Oh shit. They're going to throw grenades in here. I'm in so much trouble.
[6727.80s -> 6735.27s]  Oh God. What the hell does he have for a weapon?
[6752.94s -> 6772.36s]  I'm still sliding. It's not going to hurt me, right? Got him. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6787.72s -> 6791.58s]  All right. I had it last time. I'm good. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. I know
[6791.58s -> 6814.71s]  what I'm doing. You're going to think I'm stupid for this, but it's not stupid. Trust me. All right.
[6814.71s -> 6866.25s]  Now. Oh, this is hard. All right. Get me in the room at least. Oh Lord. I got nothing to do. I,
[6878.26s -> 6891.53s]  holy shit. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to go invisible and I'm going to run behind everybody.
[6891.53s -> 6909.10s]  I wish I didn't throw all three of my grenades like a dummy. There he is. He's dead. Oh,
[6909.10s -> 6934.78s]  that's so many people. Stop, please, please, please, please, please. All right. Stay right here.
[6936.82s -> 6948.30s]  I'm all right for now. Where are they? Are they in the room? I think they're in the far room.
[6951.74s -> 6971.62s]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. I think I killed one.
[6986.38s -> 7002.81s]  Whoa. That guy was just whispering to himself. I got it. There we are. These big rooms with all
[7004.42s -> 7022.66s]  the... Those are fun. Sliding under the flare was dope. Yeah, it's fun. I didn't even pick this up.
[7042.98s -> 7047.14s]  Hey, do that bit again where you get really mad and have a death counter that's really high.
[7047.14s -> 7052.46s]  No, you can only do that so many times. What's going on in here?
[7065.19s -> 7087.35s]  All it costs is a bit of your kindness. The Pandora Institute. I value... Oh wait, we're not done.
[7087.35s -> 7122.66s]  We're not done. Hey, I'm in here. You gonna walk over here? Hey, what the hell? What the
[7122.66s -> 7127.70s]  fuck was that guy in scuba gear? That guy was in a full scuba outfit. What the hell happened?
[7127.70s -> 7140.52s]  That reminded me of... I feel like I queued up a bunch of actions. We all queued up actions at
[7140.52s -> 7145.00s]  the same time and we all did them at the same time. That was like a strategy game. I feel like
[7145.00s -> 7150.54s]  I was playing XCOM for a second. Everyone just does all their moves at the same time. Is that
[7150.54s -> 7187.91s]  how XCOM works? I ain't gonna let you kill me. No way. Stop throwing grenades. How many grenades
[7187.91s -> 7219.21s]  do you guys have? Cease fire. That's right. Let's talk about it. Whoa! I snapped his neck. Are we
[7219.21s -> 7233.46s]  all done here? Is that it now? Can I keep going? Holy shit. Take this. He should have just shot me
[7233.46s -> 7242.33s]  in the head. At some point you don't scream before you're about to do something. Take this is
[7242.33s -> 7252.34s]  probably what you shouldn't be yelling. Take this. And then he goes for a kick. Is this kind of
[7252.34s -> 7276.12s]  fucked up? What happened here? One of those times I'm gonna get roundhouse kicked in the head and
[7276.12s -> 7315.37s]  it's gonna kill me and I'm gonna scream. Whoa. What's going on here? Okay. Now the music's
[7315.37s -> 7331.05s]  getting kind of strange. That was a scoring moment. It really was. You guys are right.
[7331.05s -> 7361.13s]  Instead of jumping off a cliff you can jump into his arms. What? Oh dear. 106.
[7362.01s -> 7369.21s]  Man of the hour. Oh hello. I'll get that elevator unlocked for you. Are you gonna die
[7369.21s -> 7376.30s]  right when this opens? I got it. According to the schematics this elevator is going to take you
[7376.30s -> 7380.94s]  straight to the basement. It's probably flooded with grunts right now but that shouldn't be a
[7380.94s -> 7388.18s]  problem for a super soldier. I gotta get back to my team. Good luck. All right well good luck.
[7388.98s -> 7410.20s]  Thanks for the help. Not dead. Yeah. Still alive. Still going. I'm just waiting.
[7411.00s -> 7415.00s]  Something's gonna. Yeah. Come on. It's an elevator in one of these kinds of games.
[7415.00s -> 7441.45s]  Of course something bad's gonna happen. What was that? Do not use elevators. Well I just used one.
[7441.45s -> 7459.66s]  That's a lot of blood. Don't use elevators. Don't use the elevators. Do not use the elevators. Do
[7459.66s -> 7469.54s]  not use. Take only one. Don't be selfish. What are these? Water? 550 for a water. What the hell
[7469.54s -> 7499.06s]  is going on here? Yeah. Amusement park prices. We're gonna disable this door. Can I grab that?
[7499.06s -> 7547.05s]  Oh. Take the health. Can I get through here? Oh health. Maximum over time. Okay. Wait. Didn't
[7547.05s -> 7557.85s]  tell. Patient exposure. Wait hold on. The effects on a human subject were catastrophic. Upon exposure
[7557.85s -> 7564.41s]  the subject's DNA was rapidly rewritten causing grotesque mutations and physical deformations.
[7565.05s -> 7569.69s]  The subject was immediately transformed. Its skin took on a sickly green hue becoming blistered
[7569.69s -> 7603.10s]  and swollen oozing a thick green liquid. Okay. Okay. Can I open this door? Abandoned move to
[7603.10s -> 7635.77s]  Maxwell. Darwin. Okay. Oh. That was so funny. Thanks. I really was hoping it was gonna.
[7636.81s -> 7655.54s]  Am I the visitor? You know what? I actually do prefer the pistol. Somebody said it. I actually
[7655.54s -> 7665.83s]  do want it instead. To Dr. Clark. Keep this off radio. It's impossible. Sterilization impossible.
[7665.83s -> 7671.75s]  Extraction impossible. We're already compromised. Relay orders to men. Enable lockdown. Procedure
[7671.75s -> 7686.02s]  disabled. Are we gonna get like a Satan face here? I would imagine a Satan face is gonna show up in
[7686.02s -> 7732.30s]  a second. We got one guy here. The one guy that had to come in here. What is that? A giant bat?
[7732.30s -> 7740.30s]  Okay. This just turned into a different game. I love how he's perfectly framed right here too.
[7740.30s -> 7748.26s]  He runs right in. Right center frame. Points at us. I see him. That guy's guaranteed to die.
[7748.26s -> 7765.82s]  Guaranteed. God damn it. All right. This just became a scary game. Conflicted scientist email.
[7765.82s -> 7774.39s]  The reality of our research pushes boundaries of medicine and science. It is essential that we do
[7774.39s -> 7782.66s]  not let personal things get in the way. Developable goals to save lives. Okay. Maybe I shouldn't have
[7782.66s -> 7806.84s]  taken the pistol. I want to go see the thing. I want to slow-mo that thing. Keep out. Does the
[7806.84s -> 7836.54s]  game have photo mode? I don't think it does. I don't think so. Did you just get me? A new special
[7836.54s -> 7862.17s]  infected or something? Okay. I was not gonna stand close to that. No fucking chance. It looked like
[7862.17s -> 7886.07s]  it was coming through the wall at me already. Mountain Dew Overtown. Doing that. Scary. Hmm.
[7886.15s -> 7916.92s]  Are we screaming? Sometimes during my use sound like SpongeBob. That's all right. Oh god. All
[7916.92s -> 7931.94s]  right. This is now infected. Got a mutated alien world or something. Jesus. Oh my god. Okay. This
[7931.94s -> 7962.95s]  is. I love how they bumped into each other though. That was fun. Get out of here. Wait. Can I grab
[7962.95s -> 7999.22s]  the enemy? Oh my god. Am I not killing them? Am I not killing them? I don't think they're dying.
[7999.22s -> 8028.09s]  Way to go. I'm playing Cod Zombies now. Sorry. I play it like Cod Zombies. Fuck you idiot. Why
[8028.09s -> 8055.91s]  are you doing that? Stop. They can't be right next to you. God damn it. Get it together. And
[8055.91s -> 8075.69s]  that works. I got an idea. Ready? That kind of works. Don't do it again. I can't be trusted.
[8091.58s -> 8111.64s]  Okay. I'm good. My accolades. All right. I think this only. They just keep spawning. So
[8119.70s -> 8147.64s]  good bro actually that time. Jesus. I didn't even know I threw it. I didn't even know I threw that.
[8147.64s -> 8159.34s]  There's a lot of enemies. I don't even have enough bullets to kill all these things. All right. All
[8159.34s -> 8168.33s]  right. All right. All right. Okay. Everybody relax. I'm going to take a sip of my pee. I'm not going
[8168.33s -> 8176.55s]  to sound like letting the air out of a balloon really slowly. I'm going to just do it. I'm going
[8176.55s -> 8279.03s]  to get focused and I'm going to do it. Oh my God. I missed. Oh. Somebody said, are those
[8279.03s -> 8305.22s]  trip hangs? Why is this guy just sitting here? What the fuck was that guy doing? I got it. All
[8305.22s -> 8328.55s]  right. What was that? You got to be shitting me. Really? Let me collect. I feel like there's a lot
[8328.55s -> 8339.96s]  of stuff I can get now. Can I do more damage on the handgun? I think those. Yeah. I think those
[8339.96s -> 8356.62s]  were trepang too. Those trepangs. I thought that was a giant laptop. It's you dude. You're the
[8356.62s -> 8407.45s]  trepang. Okay. I think I. Wait. No, I like the shotgun. Somebody was here. Go to the door. Blood
[8407.45s -> 8444.79s]  or no blood? I hear it. It's going to be another huge wave and I have no ammo. Thank God. What's
[8444.79s -> 8469.19s]  that? Oh, it's a shotgun. Is it better to take the regular shotgun or this one? Take the suppressor
[8469.19s -> 8482.76s]  off. Fuck the suppressor. Yeah. Suppressor lowers damage. I don't want to be damaged. It's the same
[8482.76s -> 8495.16s]  gun with layout. I'll take it. My mom wants to know if there's swearing in this game. I'm not
[8495.16s -> 8501.51s]  allowed to watch if there's swearing. I think there's this swearing in the game, but I think
[8501.51s -> 8514.58s]  more importantly, people's heads are exploding. So I think that's also something to keep in mind.
[8514.58s -> 8545.98s]  Jesus. It is a bat. Wait, we're just. There's. It's scary. What? Is it behind me? Is it right
[8545.98s -> 8560.52s]  behind me? There's no way anybody can do that. Oh, what do I go? How do I get out of here?
[8561.16s -> 8591.80s]  I'm sorry. I'm going to, I'm going to keep running. I'm not going to stop. Still alive.
[8591.80s -> 8618.36s]  Ooh. He has another gigantic coin. That's not what she meant. Okay. I thought she said, you know,
[8618.36s -> 8625.45s]  she said, destroy the subject. I'm like, okay, I guess does that mean, all right, where are we
[8625.45s -> 8640.50s]  going to go? You know what? I'm just noticing right now. My mouse is like, look at my mouse.
[8640.50s -> 8652.46s]  That's strange. Isn't it? I didn't even notice that till right now. Can you guys see my mouse
[8652.54s -> 8664.09s]  on the top and left of the screen right now? Or is that only coming up for me? Jesus. I'm
[8664.09s -> 8669.00s]  sorry. I probably scared you, but I scared myself. It is there. Hold on. Maybe I should put it like
[8669.00s -> 8696.28s]  exclusive full screen. It's not doing it anymore. But why did zoomed in over here? Hold on. Huh.
[8699.26s -> 8706.70s]  Wow. Is it doing it still? No, that was really strange. Has it been happening the whole time?
[8706.70s -> 8720.54s]  I think it has been. Not really. I didn't notice. No, it might've been. Okay. Well,
[8720.54s -> 8724.92s]  if you have a mouse show up on your screen, then just go exclusive full screen. It'll fix it.
[8724.92s -> 8735.53s]  All right. Now I have to destroy the subject. Anything else in here?
[8737.38s -> 8745.62s]  No. Wow. That's a lot of stuff. They are preparing me for a gigantic boss fight.
[8745.62s -> 8758.71s]  So let's go ahead and take, I want sniper rifle, sniper rifle, shotgun. This reminds me of that
[8758.71s -> 8767.91s]  VR game that stir and I played where our arms were wicked long and we were able to like put our arms
[8767.91s -> 8775.62s]  like behind our backs and like shoot ourselves in the back. We were like aiming the guns behind
[8775.62s -> 8796.22s]  ourselves. Oh, that was so fun. That game was so fun. That is so funny. Okay. Um, I can hear the
[8796.22s -> 8807.45s]  thing screaming in the other room. What about the sniper? Why would you pick a horror game for a
[8807.45s -> 8819.64s]  chill stream? Well, chill stream in the sense that I'm kind of just playing, just hanging out.
[8819.64s -> 8829.29s]  All right. I'm ready to go. Can you do, can you akimbo shotguns? I, can you, can you do well?
[8829.29s -> 8843.03s]  I don't think you can. Maybe not yet. You can? Not yet. Okay. All right. Uh, I think that does it.
[8843.03s -> 8849.27s]  Maybe is there any more grenades I can grab or no? He's, he's waiting for me to come in the room.
[8849.27s -> 8913.05s]  Okay. Boss area. I think I can hear his wings flapping running around up here. Shit. Anything
[8913.05s -> 8921.66s]  though? His brain. That dude, that's their full brain. Their whole ass brain is out of their head.
[8921.66s -> 8928.73s]  Not even in any more than one piece, their whole brain, the entire brain that was surgically
[8928.73s -> 8953.74s]  removed. That was not exploded or anything. Okay. Let's do it. All right. Cue the music.
[8953.74s -> 8960.62s]  Secure it. You want to read it? Get those laser gates turned on as soon as possible. Just heard
[8960.62s -> 8965.72s]  from the eggheads. Just one of those things get inside a reactor. This whole place is going up
[8965.72s -> 8998.55s]  in flames. Okay. Well, let's do it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Here it comes. Maybe not
[8998.55s -> 9049.34s]  yet. Maybe. Throw them into the reactor. Is that a rocket launcher or something? No. Is it? No.
[9055.82s -> 9098.41s]  Okay. Let's do it. All right. Got one. Okay. Wait, this health over here. Just throw them out the
[9098.41s -> 9126.34s]  window. Did I? Damn it. I think I walked over it accidentally. Nope. Okay. There's like three or
[9126.34s -> 9167.42s]  four more of these. Another one in there? Oh my goodness. Oh, this one up here. All right. Get out.
[9167.42s -> 9199.18s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, oh shit. I have to run. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just had to see.
[9199.99s -> 9204.15s]  It's going to be a checkpoint right there. It doesn't. Oh no, it's not. Don't do that again.
[9206.26s -> 9238.31s]  Don't do that again. That's me shooting the gun. Shut up. Shut up. I didn't throw that guy.
[9238.31s -> 9261.11s]  That guy jumped in on his own. I didn't throw that guy. That guy. Jesus. Get over it. Somebody
[9261.11s -> 9292.15s]  just. Okay. Go. I won't be an idiot this time. I promise. All right. I'm up. Go, go, go, go.
[9296.38s -> 9300.86s]  Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide. You fucking McDonald's shoe motherfucker. Let's go.
[9303.27s -> 9307.91s]  It's right behind me. That was actually terrifying. Where do I go? Where do I go?
[9307.91s -> 9332.52s]  Oh, we're fine. I don't know where to go. Chill stream. Hurry, get it. Fuck you.
[9360.52s -> 9424.50s]  Open, open, open. Where even is it? Man, that was crazy. Geez. Am I good? Did I make it? What's
[9424.50s -> 9453.48s]  the name of the game? Trey Pang 2. I'm alive. I made it. I have a feeling that thing's not dead.
[9453.48s -> 9482.26s]  Raven's on his way now. Maybe I did. Thanks guys. Okay. Let's get it. Don't walk right into it,
[9482.26s -> 9530.36s]  dude. What are you guys doing? What? Where to go? Where to go? Where to go? Goodbye. Where is it
[9530.36s -> 9579.40s]  going? Jesus. Got him. He's staring at me. There you are. There you are. There you are. All right.
[9579.40s -> 9604.06s]  Now I'm going to run this way and here we go. I want to get close as hell. Oh my God. I don't
[9604.06s -> 9651.22s]  have anyone slow down. Chill stream. Chill stream vibes. That's right. What difficulty? This is on
[9651.22s -> 9684.81s]  hard. I'm sorry. It was a good shot though. I have to pee. I'll be right back and we'll keep going.
[9684.81s -> 9699.34s]  I did unlock infinite stamina as a cheat. All progression will be saved on easy difficulty
[9699.34s -> 9981.21s]  regardless of your current difficulty. I'll be right back. See you in a minute. You guys ready
[9981.29s -> 10013.67s]  to go back? Continue. So what? What's next? Music's kind of louder than everybody else.
[10014.23s -> 10030.26s]  I keep thinking it's going to open automatically. It just isn't. I like sniper rifle a lot.
[10030.82s -> 10090.25s]  Okay. Okay. I tried to run. Is this a weapons cache? No. It's like a reactor down here.
[10091.05s -> 10094.86s]  It's fucked up.
[10094.86s -> 10134.44s]  Oh, he's so funny. He even blew up right there. Do the double drop kick wrestling move to it.
[10134.44s -> 10167.53s]  Press the button. Very well protected. I love somebody who just writes stop. Stop it. Stop that.
[10168.17s -> 10200.34s]  Are you even going to do that times 10 speed with the wild stream? Um, it's a good in theory joke,
[10200.34s -> 10222.65s]  but in practice, I'm not sure. It means no. Okay. Listening memories. She's not telling you
[10222.65s -> 10243.62s]  everything. Data package redacted. Upload complete. Not telling you everything. All right. Well,
[10243.62s -> 10249.06s]  interesting. Is this the only thing you're going to play tonight? I wanted to, I was going to do
[10249.06s -> 10257.99s]  browser game stuff, but this game is not very long from what I've heard. I heard this whole
[10257.99s -> 10265.53s]  campaign is somewhere around like four to seven hours long and I'm kind of into it. So I want to
[10265.53s -> 10287.05s]  play it. We'll do browser stuff at the time. Don't worry. What's all that? Main story is about four
[10287.05s -> 10317.30s]  and a half to five main and extra is seven. That makes sense. Hello. I want to get back in there.
[10317.30s -> 10334.95s]  All right. Appearance. This is the simulator. Go to the gun range to get guns. This is going to be
[10334.95s -> 10341.80s]  at least an eight hour stream. Well, how many, what do we have here? We've got one, two, we did
[10341.80s -> 10349.43s]  these two, three, four, but it's probably like five or six main missions. Yeah. See side mission.
[10349.43s -> 10359.14s]  I think we can get this all done in one stream. I'm not going to go as fast as I can. I'm not going
[10359.14s -> 10364.95s]  to just blow through it. It's definitely possible to do the main ones and then maybe one or two of
[10364.95s -> 10379.90s]  the side ones. Hack the servers and steal classified information. Hack servers in Horizon's
[10379.90s -> 10385.90s]  highly secure data center. Covered files from the Pandora Institute show Horizon is collaborating
[10385.90s -> 10393.67s]  with cultists. Cultists investigate the extent of their collaboration and destroy the cult.
[10393.67s -> 10405.37s]  Side missions are wave defense missions mostly. Okay. We'll do the main ones, but I do want to
[10405.93s -> 10429.43s]  I don't think I unlocked very much. Let's just go for it. Is this your favorite game ever? Check
[10429.43s -> 10473.51s]  the gun range. We got rifle, flash bangs. Hey, those are fun. That's why you're the super soldier.
[10473.51s -> 10495.11s]  Who's talking to me? Have some fun. Huh? Oh, thanks. All right. What do I want to bring? I'm
[10495.11s -> 10501.14s]  I like the, can I take the sniper rifle? I want the sniper rifle. It's my favorite gun in game
[10502.18s -> 10523.19s]  and that's why it's too bad I missed. Shotgun's fun, but we'll do SMG as well.
[10524.07s -> 10547.91s]  Resetting the range. It's fine. Folded stock and suppressor. Yeah. What does it sound like?
[10548.55s -> 10564.17s]  That sounds awesome. I love the way this sounds. All right. I'm ready. I guess I can take
[10564.81s -> 10569.29s]  armor and flashbangs. Why not? I get to keep these when I go on the mission, right?
[10569.29s -> 10583.26s]  Sounds like a paint gun. It does a little video. TF2 sniper. Maybe that's why I like it. It sounds
[10583.26s -> 10594.46s]  like that. All right, let's go outside. There's a bunch of fakes. You'll see what I'm talking about.
[10594.46s -> 10601.21s]  Does folding the stock give any advantage in a game like this? It's not like the gun is going
[10601.21s -> 10611.70s]  to bump into shit with the stock out. I think it was what? Recoil shooting, right? Here we go.
[10616.33s -> 10629.14s]  Faster reload. This is an interesting mission. Like a gigantic mansion or something.
[10629.78s -> 10637.43s]  Dwarfic Castle, Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Kill the cultist leader. Kill or capture
[10637.43s -> 10668.90s]  the scientist Dr. Kramer. Interesting. Plenty of ammo. I'm going to turn the light off. Okay.
[10668.90s -> 10681.83s]  Going down. I already have that weapon, right? It's a presser. Maybe I'll put it on the sniper.
[10684.54s -> 10711.83s]  Yeah. What game should I play? There's not much time left. This one. That's a lazy answer.
[10713.62s -> 10721.02s]  Is it though? This is a new game that just came out. It's very good. It's action packed.
[10721.02s -> 10752.50s]  It's not that long. I think that was a perfect answer. Okay. This brain came out. It's full
[10752.50s -> 10789.75s]  brain. His full brain is indestructible. What the hell was that? Eat shit. Oops.
[10809.38s -> 10816.55s]  Where are they? Where are they? What did that guy just do?
[10827.24s -> 10862.78s]  All right. That was pretty sick. I'm not going to lie. You're going to land here. What kind
[10862.78s -> 10877.83s]  of weapons do these guys have? Shotguns. Oh, that one looks different. No, it's not.
[10878.31s -> 10900.98s]  Enforcer 106. Take the brain with you. It's like left for dead gnome mission. Are they here?
[10900.98s -> 10935.29s]  Nobody here? Game looks sick. I would tell you it is sick. Didn't tell. Beware. Like those you
[10935.29s -> 10947.18s]  destroy, you too shall become. I'm having fun with it so far. I think the only real complaint
[10947.18s -> 10954.78s]  that you could have is it's not that long from everything that I've been shown, but they're
[10954.78s -> 10962.95s]  there. This is it right here. Can I get this right now? It's this guy right here. This is the guy.
[10964.02s -> 10995.77s]  That's the guy. Oh, wait. Yeah. Also, I'm also a proponent of length is not determined if a
[10995.77s -> 11003.85s]  game is any good. I would rather have a really fun, really polished, like six to 10 hour game
[11003.85s -> 11027.88s]  than a just junk filled slog of like a 20 plus hour game. Where are they? I didn't aggro the main
[11027.88s -> 11042.70s]  guy. So I guess I can kind of keep sneaking around. Nobody saw me come in here. He hates Elden Ring.
[11042.70s -> 11049.67s]  What? Here's the hold on. Elden Ring is like one of the best video games ever made. Besides millennia
[11049.67s -> 11064.94s]  and we're done. Pre patch. Today marks my first day as an apprentice. I've left my old life behind,
[11064.94s -> 11071.18s]  including my job at Horizon. I made this decision not just for myself, but my wife Martha and our
[11071.18s -> 11079.59s]  unborn child. I believe that the patriarch offers, the patriarch prefers something not that my old
[11079.59s -> 11114.65s]  life could not true. Somebody else can read. All right. They're here somewhere. That guy's still
[11114.65s -> 11127.62s]  alive. I only shot that guy in the groin. I could, that guy threw up in the balcony, did like four
[11127.62s -> 11142.07s]  Tony Hawk pro skater moves. Oh, I fucked him up so bad. He's up there. I don't think he knows what's
[11142.07s -> 11223.69s]  going on. All right. I'm going to keep going. His whole brain again. Got you. You dead? Oh God.
[11225.88s -> 11250.38s]  I'll try it one more time. Printer music? What does a printer music mean? It sounds like, what do you,
[11250.38s -> 11293.06s]  hold on. Listen, listen, listen. Oh shit. I still got it when it's still in the air. I killed that
[11293.06s -> 11310.90s]  guy. Okay. This sound, this you saying is a printer? Like an old printer? I guess maybe a little
[11316.44s -> 11326.33s]  Intel. Resets of 12 reps of pushups using the edge of a table. Resets of 12 reps of pull-ups using
[11326.33s -> 11333.06s]  the edge of a table. Resets of 12 reps of lunges using a stack of books. Resets of 12 reps of
[11333.06s -> 11342.34s]  military press using heavy books. That's how you become Saitama. So you become strong. That's the
[11342.34s -> 11351.35s]  secret. Masks and robes must remain on during PT. We do not stretch or warm up. We train as we fight.
[11354.58s -> 11378.84s]  It actually is bald. All right. Where am I going? I think it's this way. I'm now five days into my
[11378.84s -> 11383.96s]  apprenticeship at the cult hall. And I must say the schedule is quite rigorous. Rising at the crack
[11383.96s -> 11390.20s]  of dawn, praying for four hours, fasting and so on. It takes some getting used to, but I believe
[11390.20s -> 11394.12s]  it is for the greater good. The hall itself is quite impressive, but where are all the women
[11394.12s -> 11399.08s]  and children? Martha's not enjoying herself much here, but I'm sure she will accustom herself in
[11399.08s -> 11419.54s]  due time. I thought this was Thanos. Are you? What the hell? Are you? I'm going to die from this
[11419.54s -> 11428.02s]  motherfucker. He's going to kill me. What the fuck? This guy's super powered. That guy is super human.
[11428.66s -> 11435.70s]  He was literally unrecognizably fucking burnt. That. Okay. That was terrifying.
[11441.05s -> 11468.70s]  Holy shit. That guy almost killed me. What the fuck was that? He's stuck on them.
[11479.16s -> 11492.23s]  That was fucked. That was so loud. That hurt my head. We're just knocking a ton of shit over,
[11492.23s -> 11513.93s]  aren't we? Farewell. Farewell, brother. I once got to get killed by a chair, don't you?
[11514.65s -> 11540.95s]  I love this game. It's great. Okay. Now where was I going?
[11541.67s -> 11564.15s]  Briefcase. Please unfold this for the love of God. I'm fine. It's good. That's fine.
[11564.15s -> 11597.67s]  There it is. All right. What are you doing? The BLT stream? Uh, hold on. I,
[11597.67s -> 11615.40s]  hold on. I gotta pay attention to where I'm going. Uh, shit. Where am I going? I came down this way,
[11616.44s -> 11621.78s]  right? Yeah. Is this right? Yeah, this is right.
[11622.34s -> 11653.43s]  By the patriarchs. They're all still screaming. Hold on. I can get it.
[11685.46s -> 11726.38s]  You alive? This guy's so burnt. All right. I've had enough of that. Oh Jesus. They're spinning.
[11736.28s -> 11742.76s]  Oh, they were in like a carousel. That out of control carousel. Holding on
[11742.76s -> 11747.74s]  for their lives while the thing spun a million miles per hour. They're on a roller coaster.
[11749.56s -> 11787.53s]  Oh, I'm just going all the way. All right. Die. They're still alive. I'm just running up these
[11787.53s -> 11805.40s]  fucking stairs. Get away from me. Get out of here. Stop. That's the guy. That's the fucking boss.
[11806.04s -> 11825.02s]  This is the boss. This is fucking mayhem. All right. I'm just going up there.
[11825.02s -> 11872.36s]  Fuck it. I don't care. Follow me while I care. Come on. Oh Jesus. I have to relax because I'm,
[11872.36s -> 11891.22s]  I'm going to like fucking freak. Okay. Let's go. All right. Now go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[11891.22s -> 11909.94s]  That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. He's right here. Dude. What's your head
[11909.94s -> 11919.48s]  made out of, dude? What is your head made out of? Did I get him? Is he dead? Oh shit. They're all
[11919.48s -> 11936.47s]  still here. I, oh my, wait, go, go, go, go, go. I killed him. I got him. I got him. I got him.
[11937.51s -> 11954.89s]  I don't know. Just go, just go, go, go. Just go. Just go. Just go. I already killed the guy.
[11993.21s -> 12024.71s]  Wait, he's still alive. Where is this guy? But he has magical spells. Whoa. You got a different
[12024.71s -> 12038.33s]  gun and this thing looks crazy. That was fucking insane. That was a lot of fun.
[12038.33s -> 12066.82s]  Man, get your hands up. Did we get him? God damn it. I can't shoot through this.
[12066.82s -> 12075.88s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. You sorry suck of shit. How do I get out of here?
[12075.88s -> 12118.10s]  How do I get out of here? How do I get out of here? Oh, they come to you. I can tell.
[12121.30s -> 12140.20s]  Okay. I got it. Can I do something with this gun? Two smart gun. That's funny. Kind of add
[12140.20s -> 12177.38s]  an ammo for this thing. Swap it. A ham, a full ham thing is still bloody. Can I eat it? Is that
[12177.38s -> 12239.00s]  gas coming in the room? Somebody said to do that. It was kind of funny. Somebody said, get really
[12239.00s -> 12277.99s]  close to a wall and throw them in. Kind of funny. Look at all this literature. Yeah. What are you
[12277.99s -> 12285.14s]  doing? That just didn't feel like shooting the gun because it was going to take too long to rev
[12285.14s -> 12289.75s]  up the gun, which was two or three seconds too long. And I thought I could just jump over it.
[12289.75s -> 12330.41s]  That's a bad place to spawn. There's a fight going on here. Here I come.
[12351.03s -> 12395.90s]  That was some Banjo Kazooie shit there. We're good. Don't do that. You just killed somebody
[12395.90s -> 12434.12s]  on your own team. Why are you playing an FPS? You've changed, bro. Oh shit. Somebody's talking
[12434.12s -> 12462.86s]  next to my head. That was weird. How was that? Did I just bounce back into it? I was going to say,
[12462.86s -> 12485.93s]  please don't. I need ammo. Ages ago, I left my old life as a soldier behind in search of something
[12485.93s -> 12489.82s]  greater. I joined not only because of my beliefs, but also because it gave me a sense of belonging
[12489.82s -> 12531.72s]  and fulfillment. Oh, sorry. I had a drink halfway through that auto fully automatic pistol. I'm
[12531.72s -> 12543.53s]  going to take it because I want to try it. All right. Where's game progress up here?
[12543.53s -> 12646.84s]  Where are you at? Where are you at? Oh, he's in this room. Who? What? What? What's that?
[12650.04s -> 12668.06s]  Like an automatic shotgun. What is this thing? Fresh. What's up?
[12668.22s -> 12705.29s]  Let's go. Who's on my team? Hey, you on my team? Are we up? No, we're not. Who's on my team?
[12706.01s -> 12717.86s]  What was that? That was a grenade. This is a grenade. Sure. All right. I get it. Who's on my team?
[12717.86s -> 12745.13s]  Hey, you're on my team. My precious. I get it now. All right. Give me that grenade launcher.
[12745.61s -> 12758.36s]  That's us. All right. Here we go.
[12765.22s -> 12809.82s]  Oh, look at this. How like orcs or something, but it's slowed down. I feel like playing
[12809.82s -> 12828.12s]  fucking Daisy right now. Just get him going in and kill him. Just like, can I get him?
[12828.12s -> 12838.81s]  He's across the map. Can I hit him? Oh, I'm not very good. This guy's still talking.
[12838.81s -> 12859.86s]  And in my absence. What? Oh, who's with me? I'm bringing one pistol in here.
[12861.64s -> 12869.74s]  Is the neti pot stream after this? What on earth are you talking about? What are you talking about?
[12869.74s -> 12877.22s]  I used a neti pot once when I was sick, like two, three years ago. What on earth are you referring
[12877.22s -> 12902.98s]  to? This is goofy. I like it. This is a goofy weapon now. I like it a lot. This thing's empty.
[12903.70s -> 12929.30s]  You are goofy. Hey, it's fun. What's that beep? I'm not standing on a landmine, right? I need a gun.
[12929.94s -> 12947.93s]  I'm not trying to be an asshole here. I'm sorry. I'm just, you're stuck on me.
[12947.93s -> 12971.72s]  I want to sneak up behind this guy and just, just to whip him in the back of the head once.
[12971.72s -> 12998.30s]  Can I do that? I hope I can. Bro, you had your volume up way too loud. That's like you thought
[12998.30s -> 13025.61s]  you were turning it off, but you turned it all the way up. Ooh. Can I do anything? Incendiary.
[13028.38s -> 13051.98s]  Incendiary what? Shotgun? Let's take a look at the intel. Dr. Kramer. I'm now supervising
[13051.98s -> 13056.14s]  the cult experiments. It's my job to gather data and assess if there's anything usable in
[13056.14s -> 13061.50s]  their insane methods. I report every 30 minutes if I miss one, or if my heart rate monitor goes
[13061.50s -> 13068.33s]  too high, a black ops team will arrive and kill everyone, leaving no traces behind. I must regain.
[13068.97s -> 13074.49s]  I must remain objective. Cultists are fanatical and delusional, but there's a chance that some
[13074.49s -> 13085.46s]  of the methods may prove useful. If your heart rate goes too high. So I can't exercise. I can't
[13085.46s -> 13097.35s]  watch. I can't watch tenant. I can't, um, I mean, there's a lot of things I can't do. It's kind of
[13097.35s -> 13105.94s]  unfortunate. You can't. All right, we're going to move on. Incendiary on shotgun. Oh, I don't
[13105.94s -> 13119.56s]  think I can do it. Can I? Oh my goodness. I can. How did I not see that? Thank you. This might be
[13119.56s -> 13151.64s]  hit. He's dead. Jesus. Uh, shotgun or, I mean, grenade launch. Let's just, whatever. I'm doing
[13151.64s -> 13166.30s]  grenade launcher. Can I pick up these knives? Ooh, cool. I'm beginning to feel skeptical about
[13166.30s -> 13171.58s]  the cult experiments. It's clear that their methods are dangerous and unsound and I've yet to see
[13171.66s -> 13181.58s]  any real progress. Perhaps they were not entirely honest with their promises. I'm kind of concerned.
[13181.58s -> 13235.75s]  I have no bullets, but it's going to make them count. A lot of health here. Okay. I have the
[13235.75s -> 13308.30s]  10 shots. This guy here. No, is it you? How do I get up on the stairs? Check the helmet cam.
[13327.03s -> 13355.14s]  There he is. Not just that. He's also a magician. Really? Where are they approaching from there?
[13355.14s -> 13390.98s]  Okay. What's up? That was a huge first shot. It killed almost everybody. Let's go.
[13405.51s -> 13411.26s]  Any more? Oh, they're across the way. I want a throwing knife. Somebody right in the head.
[13424.20s -> 13431.14s]  Wow. How many grenades are over here? That was like 10. What? Did you see the indicator? That was
[13431.14s -> 13454.04s]  like at least six. Whoa. You got to be kidding me. All right. Let's do it clean this time.
[13463.86s -> 13510.01s]  Where are they? Where are they? It's one guy just sitting in here in the kitchen or something.
[13510.01s -> 13547.16s]  Go back to the helmet. I think I might've broke it. He's right there. I think I broke it. Wait,
[13547.16s -> 13604.62s]  was it that guy? Here we go. Did you think we're good now? Yeah. Oh, right in the head.
[13634.89s -> 13641.45s]  He landed it horizontally with his back. Dude. Oh, I think that was a bug.
[13642.41s -> 13670.17s]  That was a bug. Somebody's still alive. How come your feet are glowing red? Because I got
[13670.17s -> 13677.06s]  the fire flower. That's why I just have a fire on them. It's a nice touch. They added it.
[13691.06s -> 13729.38s]  Where are you? Oh, there you are. Oh, Jesus. Oh, run. I got to bring you all the way around
[13729.38s -> 13738.62s]  the house. You're going to get stuck in here. Watch this. Hey, bro. He has no idea where I am.
[13738.62s -> 13767.14s]  Yes, he does. Don't let him grab you. Damn it. Oh, shit. I thought I was being sneaky.
[13767.14s -> 13781.82s]  I was being sneaky. All right. Well, now knowing that I need a different gun,
[13781.82s -> 13808.66s]  this thing has no bullets. Anything on the ground? I might be in trouble. Well, it's Dragon.
[13808.66s -> 13816.07s]  Gianni is carrying this entire mission. His work is so good. Oh, the voice work. Yeah. Oh,
[13816.07s -> 13850.22s]  you better believe it. How did that miss? It went right through his armpit. Where is he? Oh,
[13856.58s -> 13879.64s]  he's destroying this whole place. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. There's another gun on the
[13879.64s -> 13921.30s]  ground. Shit. Invisibility is so useful here. Where'd he go? Jesus. That's a lot of grenades.
[13935.54s -> 13952.41s]  Don't get stuck on that. Come on, man. Get out of my way, Ben.
[13975.29s -> 13988.50s]  Almost down to the last bullet. Final bullet. Nice. This game is intense.
[13988.90s -> 14003.45s]  I can't imagine doing this on something harder than very hard. If you die instantly in Rage Mode,
[14003.45s -> 14012.65s]  I feel like that's going to be extraordinarily difficult. Extreme was not too hard to do.
[14013.21s -> 14023.88s]  I wonder if Rage Mode is. I wonder what the strategy is to actually do this on Rage Mode.
[14025.42s -> 14047.16s]  What weapon is it? What series of weapons? Is that not the right way? Oh, um, wait though.
[14048.25s -> 14067.00s]  I ran over a weapon and I need. There it is. I already have a shotgun. Is there no other
[14067.00s -> 14077.40s]  weapon on the ground? I really only have one bullet to kill this guy. That's it. I swear.
[14077.40s -> 14098.89s]  I saw another gun. There it is. All right. Creepy. Jesus. So it's true. You really are
[14098.89s -> 14109.30s]  just like me. Question is. Oh, he slowed down time. You slowed time down. I get it. He's doing the
[14109.30s -> 14134.89s]  same powers that I am. That's interesting. It kind of sounds like somebody's listening to like a
[14134.89s -> 14153.37s]  really intense movie in the other room. I'll take this thing. Look at this thing.
[14153.37s -> 14170.82s]  Still doing browser games? Um, probably not. I don't think so. I think it's going to take me
[14170.82s -> 14184.12s]  all the way to the next hour or two to beat this. Dual Weld. I got it. Dual Weld Serum. I love how
[14184.12s -> 14196.86s]  you have to inject yourself to be able to hold two guns. That's funny. H. Find another weapon of the
[14196.86s -> 14214.30s]  same type. Will two at the same time. Boy. Uh, how do you shoot them both? They both just fire.
[14214.30s -> 14232.65s]  I'll try this for now. Two shotguns. How do I switch weapons? Dual Shotgun. I feel like this
[14232.65s -> 14241.62s]  would be great. Yeah. I'm, I'm all right with this. Can I even pick up? I don't think I haven't had
[14241.62s -> 14263.58s]  two shotguns here. I don't have enough ammo for it either. Yeah. I'm good with this. Dual Auto Weapons
[14263.58s -> 14291.21s]  of Insane Recoil. Find out. Don't fall down there. Who's shooting? I just kicked that guy's
[14291.21s -> 14319.53s]  fucking chin off. Come here. Come here. Come here. Holy fuck. Holy fuck. What the hell? Oh,
[14320.09s -> 14332.25s]  I don't even know who did that. I'm not even sure that was supposed to happen, but it did happen.
[14332.97s -> 14366.74s]  I'm not entirely sure what just happened. Got him. Oh my fucking God.
[14375.54s -> 14421.78s]  Okay. Relax for a sec. Don't you dare. Get away. Who's left? Dude, what the hell? Come on.
[14422.58s -> 14435.26s]  I was trying not to hit them. I was trying to have it bounce where their feet were. Somebody
[14435.26s -> 14449.42s]  said this game makes you really feel like a guggada. True. Oh my God. That was brutal.
[14461.98s -> 14468.90s]  I think he said, Oh no. I can't even react, dude. It's fucking too much going on.
[14468.90s -> 14517.54s]  Oh no. Geez. I'm all right. Fiddlesticks. Did he actually say Fiddlesticks? No, he didn't.
[14527.45s -> 14541.80s]  You piece of shit. That was so perfect of a throw. I hate your guts. I'm not even doing that.
[14550.31s -> 14572.58s]  I just did the fucking Luigi from Mario 2. I just pulled off a Yoshi midair. Oh, okay. Go now?
[14572.58s -> 14582.55s]  You want to go now? Wait, let me get all the ammo. I got plenty. I'm good.
[14597.77s -> 14614.12s]  I think those are going to fall down. Somebody's head came down here. Hey,
[14614.68s -> 14650.28s]  watch where you're throwing those. Somebody's arm. Oh no. Oh shit. Nobody else is going to come down
[14650.28s -> 14667.19s]  here, right? It's so dusty. What's going on up there? I think somebody just said, shut the fuck
[14667.27s -> 14693.85s]  up. All right. The dust is. Wait. Oh, two guys right there. Are you guys okay?
[14705.61s -> 14725.74s]  That guy was alive. They're getting too close to the edge. Those are our teammates.
[14725.74s -> 14734.30s]  Okay. All right. I think we can move on. I mean, it's still mayhem up there, but three stooges war.
[14740.09s -> 14747.14s]  What was that? What was that? That was like somebody's thumb. What is that?
[14748.74s -> 14750.42s]  It's somebody's shoe.
[14766.17s -> 14782.23s]  This is crazy. The loafers just got ruined. How much more men do they have? Oh shit. Are you all
[14782.23s -> 14802.82s]  right? I'm kind of hoping somebody lands down here and is alive. All right. They're actually,
[14802.82s -> 14811.91s]  they're starting to get smart. They're starting to get smart. What happens if they run out of ammo?
[14811.91s -> 14841.35s]  Can they run out of ammo? Where's my grenade? Hey, I got to get out of here. I have to move on.
[14842.47s -> 14873.78s]  This is going to keep happening forever. All right. That's fun. Sneaky. That was kind of fun.
[14874.34s -> 14905.21s]  Oh, they're done. Penetrator. Oh, what's that? Oh, no. Definitely keep this. All everything.
[14905.21s -> 14917.16s]  The actor is left. Yeah, that's true. Oh, that was very enjoyable. What the fuck? Somebody burped.
[14921.62s -> 14949.88s]  What the fuck is happening? Oh, those were my guys, were they? What the hell, man? What? I
[14949.88s -> 14987.29s]  didn't know they were my guys. There's the belt again. My game just crashed. What do I do now?
[14987.29s -> 15019.93s]  Hold on. I have to restart the game. This game is very good. I love this game. It's very fun.
[15019.93s -> 15039.48s]  What was that? What the hell was that? Was that the game? What's happening? Are we good?
[15040.20s -> 15080.34s]  Are we good? I think we're good. All right. Let's go. We're going to go all the way up. Whoa.
[15093.02s -> 15115.48s]  Come here. I'm out of ammo. There's so many people over here. What am I doing?
[15116.12s -> 15147.34s]  All right. Let's go. What are you doing? Get away from me.
[15156.30s -> 15159.66s]  Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
[15160.62s -> 15210.68s]  Here we go. Why has my gun forsaken me? It feels like I wasn't into Tom and Jerry, somebody said.
[15223.53s -> 15228.97s]  Dude, I need health so bad. I have no ammo. I have no ammo. I have no ammo. I have no ammo.
[15228.97s -> 15288.36s]  I have no ammo. I have no ammo. Oh, shit. Fuck you. Oh, I didn't get them all. Shit. Sorry.
[15288.36s -> 15297.18s]  Ready? There's way too many. Oh, fuck off. Damn it. All right. I got to get a different gun.
[15297.18s -> 15346.97s]  I'm using too many bullets. I got to conserve bullets. Here we go. Better. Keep going. Go,
[15346.97s -> 15370.34s]  go, go, go, go. We're good so far. I just launched my... Don't go off the edge.
[15391.82s -> 15428.76s]  Oh my God. Better. Okay. Assess. Assess. Get rid of that. There it is. All right. I'm going
[15428.76s -> 15435.59s]  to hold off for that now. Let's just use this thing for now. Autosave here. Okay. Am I going
[15435.59s -> 15487.96s]  down? High level target. Got him. Who's got the smoke? What? Shit. Oh, thank goodness. All right.
[15487.96s -> 15508.95s]  We're fine. Everyone. We're alive. Perfectly cut screen. It was intense and I did not expect it.
[15534.46s -> 15551.72s]  You know what? Oh, I thought those were green. Ah. Sorry. These are fine. You know what? Throw
[15551.72s -> 15604.78s]  these anyways. Get rid of them. What's up? Oh, he's right there. All right. Boss time. I could
[15604.78s -> 15614.17s]  do double shotgun, but there's not enough ammo. So, I'm going to stick with this. My funny this
[15614.17s -> 15633.42s]  ammo. I think I'm good. How far into the game are you? Um, I don't know. I could put a dual
[15633.42s -> 15670.39s]  weld on here. That's exactly what I'm going to do. All right. Let's go. Boss time. Today is a day of
[15670.39s -> 15686.73s]  grieving. You are the second brother I must kill. There's a lot of guns back here.
[15687.29s -> 15704.41s]  Where do you go? All right. We're going to just expel all the weapons. I just unloaded this so
[15704.41s -> 15724.36s]  much. I'm just throw. I'm just whatever I got over here. I'm just throwing. I just went through the
[15724.36s -> 15770.97s]  table. Get out of here. I just threw an axe. Good strat. Oh, it hurts. What the fuck did that guy
[15770.97s -> 15786.28s]  come from? Where did that guy? That is another one. Oh shit. We're right in the middle of this.
[15794.18s -> 15807.08s]  It's too much stimulation. This is way too much stimulation right now. I don't even have any
[15807.08s -> 15833.27s]  ammo. It's too much stimulation. I don't know. Is there enemies? Is that thing still alive?
[15856.23s -> 15858.87s]  Shit. It's all right. We're right here.
[15883.29s -> 15892.71s]  It's too much. There's too much going on. It's just carnage. It's just mayhem. Stop moaning.
[15893.96s -> 15899.32s]  That's not me. That's them. That's them doing that. Is that not me? I don't know. Am I doing
[15899.32s -> 15909.50s]  that? I can't tell. It's intense. All right. I got to do this. This guy's got to die right now.
[15910.14s -> 15932.39s]  Did he jump out the window? He's dead. All right. All right. We're good. I got it. I got it. I'll
[15932.39s -> 15966.04s]  get it now. He's alive. He's alive. Get me the fuck away from him. Freeload the gun.
[15987.50s -> 16017.37s]  Where is he? Yeah. Stop moaning. I'm going to be. You've been breathing.
[16023.27s -> 16028.47s]  You've been breathing so loud. It's an intense game. You have a microphone right next to my mouth
[16029.40s -> 16034.82s]  when you're sitting there gaming, when you're gaming it up real hard. There's no microphone
[16034.82s -> 16038.58s]  sitting right here. Just like, Oh, let's get every fucking breath that comes out of his mouth.
[16038.58s -> 16060.22s]  That was intense. That's one chill stream. I'm chilling out.
[16061.66s -> 16070.38s]  Stuff can be intense and still just be kind of operating at like 70% or so. I'm just hanging out.
[16077.99s -> 16094.94s]  What'd you do? You're screaming. We need to go on the offensive again. Yeah. But I don't know.
[16094.94s -> 16104.54s]  Chill mindset. Chill stream is a mindset. Yeah. It's definitely a mindset. I think when I say
[16104.54s -> 16112.76s]  chill streams, I think what I mean is usually no cam and just whatever happens. I'm just going to
[16112.76s -> 16119.11s]  play and not really paying attention to much else. Looking over chat every now and then.
[16119.11s -> 16132.90s]  The game is intense. That's fine. This means he's naked. I think I'm just going, I go into these
[16132.90s -> 16143.99s]  more when I say chill stream with the intention of being dialed down like 30% or so. And plus it
[16143.99s -> 16149.03s]  is 110 degrees. It's very hot out right now. So yeah, I don't have any upper clothing on.
[16149.03s -> 16172.89s]  Oh wait, I want to see the, I think I can do it from here. This site 83 Russia. So I'm going to assume
[16172.89s -> 16182.71s]  there's probably two missions left. The green from what one guy in chat said is these are wave
[16182.71s -> 16195.54s]  missions. I'm going to imagine another one opens up somewhere around here. Some of them are.
[16200.33s -> 16206.30s]  Let me, I'm going to go pee one more time. Maybe more than once. It's cool. I like these. These are
[16206.30s -> 16212.50s]  a lot like your older streams. That's part of the intention too is just kind of turning something on
[16212.50s -> 16220.22s]  and just hanging out and doing whatever. We do a lot of wacky kind of crazy shit here, but I don't
[16220.22s -> 16233.80s]  want that to be the only thing that anyone can ever anticipate here. If that makes sense. And again,
[16233.80s -> 16242.17s]  the whole off brand stuff kind of splitting up time between having a job and everything. I have
[16242.17s -> 16249.88s]  a job now. Yeah, I'll be right back. We'll keep going. Site 83. As long as you're having fun. Oh
[16249.88s -> 16453.34s]  yeah, for sure. Oh Megalel a job. All right. You're back. I am back. Oh, hold on. I forgot my drink.
[16453.34s -> 16496.94s]  All right. Let's keep going. Site 83 is the next one. Repurpose this former Soviet military base
[16496.94s -> 16502.42s]  into a research facility. Nearby civilians were evacuated earlier today under the cover of a gas
[16502.42s -> 16517.05s]  leak. We're sending you in with a small team. I do want to play around with the weapons for a second.
[16517.05s -> 16555.90s]  Where's that area to do that in? A deadly nerve agent. There it is. All right. Bolt launcher.
[16555.90s -> 16574.97s]  Rat bombs. Some of these you have to actually beat on high difficulty. Bolt launcher. That's what this
[16574.97s -> 16591.34s]  does. I thought this was a shotgun. Okay. It's not a shotgun. What else can you do? Penetrator. More
[16591.34s -> 16602.07s]  accurate and powerful non-explosive bolts. Single fire. How does that work? That was just a very,
[16602.23s -> 16620.26s]  it's like a magnum. It's like a Resident Evil magnum. Pretty good. It doesn't have a lot of
[16620.26s -> 16639.19s]  ammo though. Pretty low. I'll try it. It's a comedy gun. Does that mean I could have two of them?
[16645.06s -> 16659.18s]  You can't use two of them? Okay. I actually like these. Take the suppressor off. Try the two
[16659.18s -> 16700.76s]  shotguns. Yeah. Let's do that. Excuse me. That's an easy way to get them out of the way. I just died
[16700.76s -> 16716.31s]  in a place where you shouldn't, you can't even die. What just happened? I couldn't pick up the
[16716.39s -> 16727.75s]  shotguns on the ground. You saw me try at least a few times. I tried. My theory was I could throw
[16727.75s -> 16741.03s]  a grenade and they would get out of the way. And it was kind of true. We haven't done this in a
[16741.03s -> 16765.86s]  while. Ooh. Moody. Keep the red shoes. Let's do that. All right. Now let's go back to what I was
[16765.86s -> 16801.53s]  going to do. Shotgun. Shotgun again. There it is. So how does this work? Wacky. I kind of don't like
[16801.53s -> 16827.06s]  it though. We'll go bolt launcher and the double SMG. No suppressor, no nothing. But I do want this
[16827.06s -> 16839.22s]  to have the penetrator on. All right. Can you dual snipers? I probably not. Let's say it if I can.
[16839.22s -> 16851.11s]  Dual snipers would be strange. You could fire one of those quicker than just dual welding. Yeah.
[16851.11s -> 16867.94s]  That's what it feels like. All right. Let's go. Is there anything else you can do up here?
[16867.94s -> 16888.41s]  Or is it just these three things? Can I get in this room again? I somehow get this wrong every
[16888.41s -> 16915.61s]  oh there it is. All right. Site 83. Let's do it. I will say I do have a hard out in about an hour.
[16915.61s -> 16920.28s]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat the whole thing in one sitting here. I'm not going to
[16920.28s -> 16950.20s]  rush. It's a hard out. Somewhere around 830 Pacific I have to have to go. I think it's possible. Each
[16950.20s -> 16956.62s]  mission has been about 45 minutes to an hour. Ooh. But I'm not rushing this. I genuinely really like
[16956.62s -> 16961.50s]  this game a lot. So I'm not rushing to the end. I want to stream it again. Let's do it again.
[16962.71s -> 16970.82s]  And do the side missions and stuff. So don't worry. The next stream after House Slipper I
[16970.82s -> 16978.86s]  will finish Trippang. So what does the gas mask do now? This mission is pretty long.
[16982.84s -> 16986.52s]  And browser games. Well that would make a lot of sense wouldn't it?
[16988.49s -> 16991.93s]  Finish up Trippang and then do browser stuff. That makes sense to me.
[16996.71s -> 17007.18s]  Yeah. House Slipper is Tuesday. We're never going to see this game again. No, no way.
[17008.14s -> 17025.37s]  No way to what you said. Are you going to dress fancy? I might.
[17032.95s -> 17044.89s]  This mission is really good. Ooh, nice. They've all been pretty strong so far.
[17069.51s -> 17075.43s]  Sorry. I should be talking. What's going on everybody? Welcome to mission five.
[17076.47s -> 17084.33s]  We are ready. We're going to get in here. We're going to guns blazing. Make sure you follow the
[17084.33s -> 17100.70s]  stream. Intel. Emergency alert. All personnel must don gas masks and CBRN suits immediately.
[17101.26s -> 17106.89s]  Shelter in place and await further orders. Do you experience auditory or visual hallucinations?
[17106.89s -> 17140.17s]  Disarm yourself and report to security immediately. Jesus. Bro, you're watching TV.
[17142.34s -> 17146.98s]  There's no way you can see through that. You're watching YouTube videos through that thing.
[17147.56s -> 17149.72s]  I'm not going to tell on you, but like, come on, turn it off.
[17161.59s -> 17182.49s]  Does the gas mask mean I can't run for that long or is it my breathing different or something?
[17189.94s -> 17190.82s]  That would make sense.
[17200.74s -> 17205.19s]  All right. Who dies first? Phantom one one or Phantom one two?
[17208.26s -> 17215.37s]  Composer or Oracle? Who dies first? Me or me?
[17216.49s -> 17223.91s]  Let's, okay, let's get a vote. Is there a mod right here? Who dies first? Phantom one one.
[17225.46s -> 17237.05s]  This is Oracle. Composer or me? Who dies first? That's actually going to be really hard.
[17244.18s -> 17248.49s]  Bet or a poll? I think it has to be a poll because bet would be between two, right?
[17248.49s -> 17256.92s]  Let's do a poll. Bet? Can you bet with more than, you can add more?
[17257.86s -> 17264.55s]  All right, then make it a bet. Who dies first? Between the three of us.
[17265.03s -> 17271.16s]  Oracle, who is one one, composer is one two, and then me.
[17271.16s -> 17277.08s]  Well, now you got me all fucked up because now I'm gonna, I'm gonna be really concerned now.
[17277.08s -> 17290.87s]  The options are Oracle, who is one one, composer who is one two, and then me.
[17290.87s -> 17300.12s]  What if no one dies? Well, then everyone gets refunded. Yeah, they're doing it now.
[17300.12s -> 17318.90s]  Is it friendly fire? Yes, I believe that's correct. Part of me kind of hopes we open this door and a
[17318.90s -> 17324.58s]  grenade just kills all three of us. Then we're gonna have to go frame by frame and see who
[17324.58s -> 17347.86s]  exploded into guts first. People saying like, oh, what if we, we can just look it up? Yeah.
[17351.67s -> 17361.53s]  I'm in this too. I've died probably 40 or 50 times so far in this game.
[17361.53s -> 17368.10s]  In the, in the gameplay walkthrough, it does not say, hey, and then streamer German985 walks
[17368.10s -> 17387.91s]  down the hallway and gets hit in the head with an axe. All right, good luck. Imagine, imagine betting
[17387.91s -> 17400.17s]  on fucking Oracle. Couldn't even go through the door, right? I thought that just killed me
[17400.17s -> 17439.83s]  for some reason. What was that? Okay, I thought he disappeared. Hey, get out of the way. 31, 33,
[17439.83s -> 17467.90s]  and 36%. Wow. Oh, my fucking heart attack. That 83 was formerly a Soviet military base.
[17467.90s -> 17495.45s]  I still got everybody. Oracle, composer. This door is automated. See if you can find a generator.
[17495.45s -> 17510.41s]  We'll keep this always. I'm not gonna die at the exact same time. These motherfuckers set up flood
[17510.49s -> 17513.45s]  lights, but they don't have the common decency to change a fucking light bulb.
[17513.45s -> 17539.99s]  They're both going to die off camera. They're both going to die off camera. But who screams first?
[17539.99s -> 17545.32s]  Who screams first? It's going to be composed. It's going to be like,
[17548.71s -> 17560.86s]  and then fucking Phantom's going to be like, no, composer. One member of the security team
[17560.86s -> 17575.40s]  is unaccounted for. Here we go. The guy's running faster than an F1 car. That's scary.
[17575.40s -> 17585.82s]  I thought his name was Oracle. What'd I say? Phantom? I don't even have their names right.
[17588.28s -> 17592.22s]  Oh, yeah. Phantom. That's a pretty cool name, though.
[17602.76s -> 17612.10s]  Okay. I almost just lost it for myself. Oh, they're Phantom one. Okay, right. Phantom is
[17612.10s -> 17625.66s]  like the name of the unit. All right. That's what it was. I'm actually really intrigued.
[17627.48s -> 17671.69s]  Who gets grabbed by the monster first? Are we good? Where'd they go? Can we identify them?
[17671.69s -> 17695.54s]  Are they alive? We would have heard them on the radio. That's a lot of blood. All right.
[17695.54s -> 17702.07s]  Get the forensics. Is this Oracle's blood here? Whose blood is this? What time did they die?
[17708.34s -> 17733.54s]  I saw somebody. I saw a body on the ground. Jesus Christ. Don't run. What do you mean don't run?
[17734.18s -> 17772.34s]  Can't kill them. So I'm hallucinating. I think they're blind. Don't run. Move silently. Oh,
[17772.34s -> 17787.88s]  you got to be kidding me. Crystal physically pulling and absorbing several objects within
[17787.88s -> 17793.26s]  close proximity. I'm not sure where they're taken to. There's several cameras inside and
[17793.26s -> 17797.02s]  they continue to transmit from the location at least a thousand miles away. Thousands of miles
[17797.02s -> 17818.58s]  away. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? It's coming down.
[17818.58s -> 17825.43s]  What do I do? Okay. I know what to do. You just said run. That's the one thing it said to not do.
[17826.15s -> 17846.74s]  Oracle's going to go on the radio. I'm so glad I could see you. Phantom over there didn't make it.
[17848.14s -> 17867.40s]  Or whatever. Composer. I don't know. I met the guy yesterday. I don't remember what his name is.
[17883.70s -> 17887.54s]  This is composer. This is composer. I repeat. This is composer taking heavy enemy fire.
[17888.66s -> 17916.01s]  What the fuck did it come on? Did both of them die at once? I don't know. I don't know. We didn't
[17916.01s -> 17950.10s]  even hear a scream. We didn't hear anything. Am I going the right way? Yeah. Usually there's a
[17950.10s -> 17961.54s]  yowl or something. Yeah. There usually is a yowl. Access attempt successful uploading. Data package.
[17962.41s -> 17972.44s]  Upload complete. Incoming transmission. Bunch of swears. User identified. Subject 106.
[17973.24s -> 17983.05s]  Your mission is nearing completion. Will it end on your terms or theirs? Who is sending us these
[17983.05s -> 18034.95s]  things? Yeah. Usually there's a yowl. Can I move this? It was activated somehow. That's not good.
[18034.95s -> 18040.92s]  And it gets worse. PA system said there is some unauthorized activity in the loading bay.
[18041.56s -> 18042.68s]  Think we ought to check it out.
[18042.68s -> 18051.77s]  What the fuck is that? Don't let him near the console.
[18051.77s -> 18069.40s]  Did you say that? Don't. Hey. My last breath. Don't let him near the console. Uh oh. Is he
[18069.40s -> 18084.73s]  going to be okay? Yeah. They're going to be fine. I'm going to get jumpscare grabbed by one of these.
[18086.98s -> 18106.28s]  Wait. Who is that? I. How did you knock it? You know there's monsters around here. You should
[18106.28s -> 18112.14s]  be using suppression things. You're going to attract the monster. You guys are attracting the
[18112.14s -> 18143.88s]  monster. You are attracting the monster. You idiots. Why are you firing so? But okay.
[18145.67s -> 18152.82s]  Are they still alive? We don't know if that was them in the room. Hold on. We need to confirm this.
[18153.82s -> 18168.66s]  You died first. But we're not sure though. We're not sure. How's this for strange activity?
[18180.47s -> 18186.55s]  First confirmed death? No, no, no. That's not how it works. Not yet. Not yet. We need to know if
[18186.55s -> 18218.10s]  they died first. That's not how time works. They may have been dead from the very beginning.
[18218.10s -> 18225.38s]  I think one of them was on the ground. Possibly. We got to confirm it. I hear the whisperings.
[18225.38s -> 18250.63s]  Let's cope. Even if it is cope, we need to confirm it. I agree with you. It very well could be me.
[18251.19s -> 18280.98s]  What if they're MIA forever? I don't know. Is it confirmed? I hate this. Am I even going the right
[18280.98s -> 18322.46s]  way? No. This way? This room is so bright. It's hard to see. Oh, okay. What is that? Something
[18322.46s -> 18339.75s]  sprinting around? If he gets to the end and those two dudes are still alive, then he died first.
[18339.75s -> 18361.75s]  How are we ever going to know? Something is sprinting around out here. Okay. It's just that.
[18361.75s -> 18387.37s]  What the hell is going on? What's wrong with my bitrate? Do I have to do something here?
[18387.37s -> 18421.53s]  What the fuck just happened? Okay. So I'm hallucinating right now. That's what's going on.
[18421.53s -> 18495.10s]  Um, this is back rooms? Actual back rooms? Hold on. Do not enter. I'm going in. Nevermind.
[18495.10s -> 18529.06s]  Uh, what's going in here? I thought that was a really cool Fortnite weapon. These posters again.
[18546.18s -> 18613.59s]  Oh, fuck you. I can't go through this glass. I don't like this. Something is running. Come on.
[18613.59s -> 18638.07s]  What's that? Something's red over there. What is that thing? This actually sucks. This actually
[18638.07s -> 18657.00s]  is very scary. Oh, who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Do we have an ID? We have an ID. You still
[18657.00s -> 18698.28s]  died first. They died after you. Hold on. We don't know that. I don't know who that is. Oh,
[18698.28s -> 18726.26s]  it's just a radio playing scary Halloween CDs. Come on, dude. I'm never betting channel points
[18726.26s -> 18745.56s]  ever again. No, we'll pay it out. It needs to be confirmed. All right. Auto save. Holy shit.
[18745.56s -> 18788.76s]  This dude pogged his pants. Oh, what the fuck? It just knows where I am. I thought if I stop
[18788.76s -> 18847.98s]  doing that. Oh, it's that hand again. Stop doing that. Oh, yeah. All right. Get the intel.
[18847.98s -> 18862.90s]  Take a bath. Just paranoid that if I'm going to run. I've heard the sound effects this whole time.
[18862.90s -> 18877.99s]  Well, very obviously we got here. This is still fine. I like these weapons. I'm going to keep them.
[18877.99s -> 18946.28s]  Find me? The hell does that mean? Somebody just used that. When I find, what do I do? Okay. Where
[18946.28s -> 18979.56s]  am I trying to go? This way. Don't do it. Are you crouching? Uh, no, this is the character's height.
[18979.56s -> 18990.20s]  Phantom 2-1. That's Phantom 2-1. Do we wait? It's 2-1. I wonder if they're going to be down there.
[18990.20s -> 19033.16s]  We need 1-2 and 1-1. I pressed it, right? Is there no power or something? I do. Do you have any idea
[19033.16s -> 19057.91s]  where 1-1 and 1-2 is? I need to confirm if they died. I had a bet. He's got the autopsy report.
[19057.91s -> 19104.39s]  Oh shit. Phantom. Wait, it's not you guys. It was them. If it was them, that would have been so
[19104.39s -> 19115.83s]  fucking funny. That would have been unbelievably funny. I don't think there would have been another
[19115.83s -> 19125.37s]  funnier clip on this channel if I just unloaded and killed them both. Uh, all right. Now what?
[19125.37s -> 19151.34s]  Drop down here? No way, right? I guess so. What was that? There was somebody in there.
[19151.34s -> 19177.56s]  That was weird. Static. The expedition team members and all camera feeds were cut.
[19177.56s -> 19226.26s]  Gas lamps went off. Everyone's waiting to get gas masks. Weird. Oh. Uh, yeah. What can I do for you?
[19226.26s -> 19289.61s]  Boy. Somebody's in here. Erm, what's going on here? I like the erm. All right. I just
[19289.61s -> 19295.35s]  remember playing Call of Duty. Black Ops. And there would be people running around like this.
[19295.35s -> 19304.28s]  And they would be playing the way that this game is actually played. In fast motion. And they would
[19304.28s -> 19338.18s]  kill that many people in a room. Weird carpet. God. I'm thinking about just sprinting. It just
[19338.18s -> 19352.65s]  disappeared. Oh, stop it. What the hell was that? Did you see that? I saw it. I saw it. I saw it.
[19352.65s -> 19403.08s]  All the time. I saw it. You right here. Found you. Oh, let me play Call of Duty for a second.
[19403.42s -> 19413.21s]  Let me play Call of Duty for a second. Make sure I'm like lying down on the ground. Is that a hallway?
[19413.93s -> 19444.98s]  Okay. Did somebody just walk in? I'm here. I'm here. Kill me. I'm here. I'm here. Kill me. Pretty
[19444.98s -> 19470.14s]  good, Arnold. At least a 3 out of 10. I like it the way they are. Don't. That thing just keeps burping
[19470.14s -> 19525.21s]  in my ear and it scares me every time. Oh, I can play Call of Duty. Oh, shit. I got out ammo.
[19525.21s -> 19561.40s]  Our UAV is online. Our UAV is airborne. What's that thing that was in the sky and just went
[19563.05s -> 19574.90s]  baaaaaaam. Why would you throw that grenade over there? Explain it. Explain it to me. Explain it.
[19595.99s -> 19603.32s]  All right. We're gone. You and me. If that thing shows up, I'm feeding it to you.
[19603.32s -> 19613.34s]  I don't know if you're going to want to eat it though, dude. What happened? Well, get out of
[19613.34s -> 19620.17s]  here then. Oh, you're not allowed to come through here. Only the main character gets to do this.
[19620.17s -> 19683.19s]  I need one, two in there. I don't see one, two. All right. What do we got? Okay. Double laser.
[19683.19s -> 19707.98s]  Composer? Oh, it's a different person. One, two, cauliflower. Did I do that? Did I do that?
[19708.54s -> 19737.05s]  It was quite the Steve Urkel. Uh, okay. Subject 83. Let me in.
[19751.10s -> 19832.66s]  Do I have to sneak? Where's subject 83? How did you not get hit by goodbye? Wait, give me that.
[19833.30s -> 19843.85s]  Subject 83. I don't even know where it is. Where is it? Maybe I have to shoot this. Can I control
[19843.85s -> 19877.38s]  that? I don't think so. Something's coming. What the hell is that? Are they all going to turn into
[19877.38s -> 19883.03s]  monsters? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[19884.09s -> 19898.70s]  When they're doing that, I think I have to go press the stuff on the walls, right? Uh, wait,
[19898.70s -> 19932.36s]  can I, I can't just do this. I think that's what I have to do. Um, I don't know. Oh, touch it.
[19932.36s -> 19985.40s]  If I can get them all. There's two more. Oh shit. Oh, die. Oh, right in his head.
[19988.86s -> 20029.85s]  Jesus. We're still firing. All right. I got to turn these off. This game is chaos. It's great.
[20029.85s -> 20038.57s]  What the? We're good. The Jerma die first. Why is the bet still going? Uh, cause it needs to be
[20038.57s -> 20059.30s]  confirmed. We've not confirmed it. It's eight 30. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I got to, I got to
[20059.30s -> 20068.92s]  go, but not, I can, I can finish this. This is probably the boss. Uh, now what? Yeah. Low's almost
[20068.92s -> 20075.91s]  over. I can stick around for like another 20 minutes right here. Where's this electricity?
[20076.47s -> 20092.84s]  There it is. Composer two one is not our guy. Yeah. If I get, if we get to the end of the level and we
[20092.84s -> 20106.90s]  can't confirm it, then then we'll just refund everything. Oh, that's a lot of people in there.
[20107.86s -> 20145.10s]  We still alive. Whoa. Oh shit. In my pants. That guy has a machine gun. What did he say?
[20146.97s -> 20180.02s]  Thanks a lot. All right. Any more ammo and this should be it right here. Right. I'm stuck on the
[20180.02s -> 20205.69s]  stairs. All right. There's one more. I think it was the one that was up here. Yep. The last one.
[20216.44s -> 20228.12s]  Oh God. Damn it. I had way too much confidence running down there without any slow mo. It's okay.
[20228.12s -> 20257.34s]  It saves it right there. Thank you. Right. Oh, all right. Get away, get away, get away, get away.
[20260.81s -> 20281.51s]  That had to have killed him. Oh, quiet. You're so loud. Oh my God. You have a flame thrower of some
[20281.51s -> 20318.55s]  sort. All right. This is it. Perfect sleep stream. Uh, I'm not so sure about that, but we are having
[20318.55s -> 20329.67s]  fun nonetheless. All right. Let me just get everything. Cause this is the last wave where
[20329.67s -> 20334.55s]  this might be the actual fight. Maybe I'm definitely gonna have to shoot it with that. That's
[20335.11s -> 20365.67s]  without a doubt. Any more ammo or anything? Oh, whatever. Just don't die. Let's go. All right.
[20365.67s -> 20399.85s]  They come from over here. Yep. I think I did okay. I need a new gun. Okay. That looks good.
[20400.57s -> 20435.66s]  So now what? There it is. All right. Turn this shit on. Did it make it? Oh,
[20437.11s -> 20458.49s]  shit. I don't think we can confirm who actually died. Pay up. Somebody was lying on the ground
[20460.33s -> 20468.31s]  right at the beginning. I don't think we can confirm who it was. And then I died. Yeah. I
[20468.31s -> 20476.33s]  think we got a refund. Send it all back. There's only one line on the ground. We can't confirm.
[20488.15s -> 20501.45s]  Cool. Crazy shit in your last mission. It's what a Ryzen doesn't understand. Yeah. Just refund.
[20501.45s -> 20527.62s]  It's fine. All right. We got one more mission to do, but it is not going to be tonight.
[20528.18s -> 20535.53s]  I got to get out of here. I've got to do some stuff before it gets to be too late. I'll see
[20535.53s -> 20551.34s]  you guys on Tuesday. Tuesday at 1 PM Pacific. We're doing a big house flipper event somewhere
[20551.34s -> 20558.65s]  between 10 and 14 or so, 11 or 12 different people, different streamers. Everyone's going
[20558.65s -> 20564.17s]  to make a house at the same time. They have about an hour and 10, maybe minutes, hour and 20.
[20564.17s -> 20579.46s]  I'm going to get a tour of each house individually. Then after that, I'm going to be dipping out for
[20579.46s -> 20586.52s]  about four or five days. And you'll see me after Tuesday. I mean, you'll see me probably on the
[20586.52s -> 20594.34s]  weekend. We'll finish this up and we'll do some browser games. But 1 PM Pacific Tuesday, be there
[20594.34s -> 20598.63s]  if you want to see the house flipper stuff. There's going to be a lot of house flipper streams being
[20598.71s -> 20606.60s]  streamed. We're going to take the house flipper category, probably as high as possible, the
[20606.60s -> 20616.46s]  highest. I'm going to try to get it as high as it's ever been. We'll do the sunflowers on Tuesday
[20616.46s -> 20626.74s]  as well. Well, all right. Oh, squeaky voices. We're going to play with these later. Spooky mode.
[20626.74s -> 20632.90s]  Okay. There's some funny stuff here we'll do on this coming weekend. All right, buddy. See you
[20632.90s -> 20642.44s]  soon. See you tomorrow. See you Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out as always.
[20644.62s -> 20651.16s]  Sure, thanks. It was very fun. I highly recommend it. You can make this game as hard or as easy as
[20651.16s -> 20669.05s]  you want. I highly recommend it. BLT? That's right. I do have to eat the BLT still. Maybe soon. Maybe
[20669.05s -> 20682.95s]  later. Never would have thought I'd like it if you didn't show this game. Well, I'm glad you saw it.
[20682.95s -> 20696.98s]  Very fun. See you Tuesday. 1 PM Pacific. Write it down if you have to or not. You don't have to be
[20696.98s -> 20708.15s]  there if you don't want to. You can do whatever you do. Do whatever you're going to do on Tuesday.
[20708.15s -> 20778.86s]  See you soon. Take care. Call your mother. Call your father. See you Tuesday. See you later.
