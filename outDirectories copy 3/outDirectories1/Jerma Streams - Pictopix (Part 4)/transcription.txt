[34.42s -> 49.62s]  How you doing? Good afternoon. I hope you're having a good day today. I hope you had a good last four or five days.
[50.10s -> 59.55s]  I've been pretty good. It's been kind of a wild couple of weeks, wouldn't you say? This is a normal streamer voice.
[61.35s -> 67.05s]  Geode Andy, that's me. Geode Andy.
[70.93s -> 79.78s]  500,000 follower Andy, what'd I do? What did that happen? Where do you see that? That's not- no, no, it's not. No, it's not.
[80.26s -> 83.27s]  I'm at 499.
[84.19s -> 86.88s]  097.
[87.64s -> 88.64s]  499,000.
[88.64s -> 96.80s]  That's not 500. You just made me celebrate for something that's not even real. Is that a lot?
[97.48s -> 99.48s]  That's a lot, right?
[99.64s -> 103.54s]  That's a lot.
[103.54s -> 108.80s]  500,000 followers? How many subs did I have on YouTube? On the main channel?
[111.83s -> 121.27s]  700,000? Well, that's a lot. Yeah, that is a lot. Not even seven figures laughing my ass off.
[122.15s -> 127.30s]  Hey, we're halfway to seven figures. That's what you meant to say.
[128.06s -> 133.26s]  Hey, hey, the glass is half full. Glass is not half. Empty glass is half full.
[133.94s -> 138.45s]  Now give me some more orange juice or I'm gonna complain to the fucking manager.
[139.05s -> 147.39s]  So we just gave 10 subs. Hey, Tangie. Hey, Tang Dynasties. Thanks for the 10 subs.
[147.87s -> 154.54s]  So, um, we have- there's a lot of shit we have to talk about. A lot of things to discuss.
[155.26s -> 162.10s]  I feel like this is like a company update stream. This is like a business update company
[162.82s -> 164.82s]  newsletter stream. That's what this is gonna be.
[165.66s -> 167.57s]  First of all,
[167.57s -> 174.62s]  thank you for the insane support on the last stream. That's a number- we broke over 50,000 concurrent viewers.
[175.22s -> 179.10s]  Which that's fucking insane. That's- I can't even- that's a-
[179.70s -> 188.03s]  That's like double what the highest view count I've ever had was. It's remarkable. I can't even- I can't even believe it.
[189.73s -> 196.89s]  And yes, I had- I know we- we were not prepared for the, uh, the enthusiasm, I guess,
[197.17s -> 198.97s]  for the Grotto Beast stuff.
[198.97s -> 204.51s]  But I know everybody has a ton of questions about Grotto Beast. Like, from every angle, it's like,
[204.51s -> 209.47s]  Hey, hey, tell us more about Grotto Beast. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hit the brakes for a second.
[210.03s -> 212.37s]  There-
[212.37s -> 219.65s]  Just hit the brakes. I know everyone's really excited about it. I can't- we- just give me a few weeks.
[220.17s -> 224.53s]  Please. I- trust me when I say I want to be screaming about the stuff.
[225.13s -> 230.61s]  But I- we can't- we have to just wait a few weeks. Give me a few weeks. We're still-
[231.82s -> 237.38s]  I need like a company policy fucking generic PR statement. Where do I get it from?
[237.86s -> 244.85s]  I need a- I need a generic company PR statement. Let me Google one.
[246.19s -> 248.75s]  Generic PR statement.
[249.39s -> 259.14s]  Okay, let's see. Generic PR statement. We've got to get a good one here, because just- I can't- how do I word this?
[259.70s -> 264.42s]  What you- when you- how to make a statement to the media?
[265.74s -> 271.46s]  Free press release template. This one says talk is cheap.
[273.79s -> 276.90s]  Anyways.
[276.90s -> 284.83s]  Just- just hold off for a little bit. There's tons of projects in the works. There's tons of announcements that I have. Lots of them.
[285.19s -> 290.98s]  There are probably five projects that are in the works, and these are not things you're gonna see a year from now.
[291.10s -> 297.78s]  This stuff is hitting the ground running, and there's gonna be major, major shit to talk about over the next three weeks.
[298.34s -> 300.34s]  Which leads me to the next thing we're about to talk about.
[300.90s -> 308.26s]  So because of the amount of projects that are being worked on, and the amount of stuff that's happening- remember, 2020 got all fucked up here.
[308.94s -> 315.48s]  A ton of projects got moved to 2021. I have to get this medical stuff under control. I have to.
[316.00s -> 323.70s]  It's getting to a point now where there's so many interesting things that are gonna be happening over the next six months.
[323.74s -> 328.00s]  I have to get a procedure done. I have to do it.
[328.52s -> 330.82s]  So,
[330.82s -> 337.08s]  I hate- I hate- I hate- I don't want to say it, but I have to. I have to go on another break.
[337.74s -> 344.94s]  Because I'm gonna be doing a bunch of doctors appointments, and I'm actually gonna try as hard as I can to get a procedure done.
[345.14s -> 352.27s]  I'm probably gonna get injections, whether that's intercostal injections or trigger point injections into my back area, into my chest area.
[352.27s -> 355.39s]  We have to try a real treatment plan here.
[356.63s -> 360.87s]  Because there's too many things going on this year that I have to not be like,
[360.87s -> 364.47s]  Ah! Ah! Ah, hold on. Yeah, give me a minute. Ah!
[365.03s -> 367.03s]  I can't- yeah, I gotta sit down for like an hour.
[367.87s -> 370.51s]  There's too much shit going on. I have to take care of this.
[371.03s -> 376.97s]  So, this is- I'm not gonna go on break for as long as I did last time. Last time was to make sure I didn't have anything
[377.81s -> 379.81s]  really major or horrible
[379.93s -> 383.03s]  going on. I spent like two or three months
[383.99s -> 385.99s]  somewhere in the middle of 2020.
[386.35s -> 389.99s]  That was to rule out everything that could have been really bad, and we did.
[390.59s -> 396.35s]  So, I came back. I changed my kind of streaming policy. It helped a lot.
[397.71s -> 401.83s]  That like four to six hours instead of like seven to eight hours, it really was helpful.
[402.35s -> 408.77s]  But now it's time to actually get a- I need- I need to get something done. I have to get a procedure done.
[409.21s -> 416.86s]  So, the next- I would assume probably three weeks, and this is not- this is not three weeks into two months, I promise.
[417.50s -> 423.31s]  I'm going to go get something done, and I will be back. And I'll be back on-
[424.55s -> 432.67s]  This is not intentional, but you know, I'm- I'm- please, trust me what I say. Me coming back on April 1st is
[432.87s -> 436.66s]  not like a joke stream. I'm coming back on April 1st.
[437.42s -> 438.74s]  So,
[438.74s -> 441.42s]  maybe- maybe I will do something. I don't know. Just keep an eye out.
[441.90s -> 447.38s]  But this whole break is not to have something weird happen on the 1st. Something weird probably just will happen on the 1st.
[448.10s -> 451.52s]  So, I want to make sure that's out there.
[451.52s -> 456.28s]  I have a lot of personal stuff. I have a lot of family stuff, and medical stuff.
[456.84s -> 461.80s]  That- I need- I gotta close the book on this shit. That's TLDR.
[462.32s -> 465.18s]  Now, what this means for you is,
[466.62s -> 468.34s]  when I come back,
[468.34s -> 473.24s]  we're- I probably shouldn't do this on the 1st. I'm gonna have like four announcements.
[473.84s -> 477.68s]  Like major announcements. I don't- I shouldn't do- should I do that on the 1st of April?
[477.68s -> 479.68s]  I feel like people think that was a joke.
[479.72s -> 482.54s]  Maybe I'll do it on the 2nd of April.
[482.74s -> 487.07s]  Okay, so April 2nd, you can expect a bunch of major announcements.
[487.43s -> 495.46s]  So, I'm not gonna do this on the 1st. Save the announcements for after. Do it on the 1st. That'll be funny.
[503.51s -> 510.89s]  It's gonna be wicked funny, but I- let me just- I have to be very clear. I'm
[513.10s -> 517.90s]  overwhelmed by this shit that you guys have been saying. It's- everyone's been so
[518.74s -> 523.02s]  supportive. I've seen so much, like- I think at one point,
[523.62s -> 526.74s]  this stream was trending on Twitter, like number two in the United States.
[527.26s -> 532.55s]  When I was told that, I was like, you're a liar. That didn't happen. It was a joke. You made that up.
[532.95s -> 537.70s]  It's like, no. I was getting like sent screenshots and shit. It's like, what the fuck is going on?
[539.59s -> 541.59s]  And I'm really, really also happy to see that-
[542.15s -> 545.47s]  that Nevada Science Center. A lot of you guys are supporting
[545.99s -> 551.43s]  those guys, and they were so, so nice to do that. They put up with a lot of my bullshit.
[552.59s -> 556.42s]  So, I'm really happy to see you guys are actually supporting them. So, it's really good to see.
[556.98s -> 562.74s]  So,
[562.74s -> 564.06s]  TLDR,
[564.06s -> 568.78s]  tons of major shit that you're gonna hear about on April 2nd. I'll be back on April 1st.
[569.42s -> 574.12s]  I'll see you later. Alright, goodbye. No, I'm just kidding. We're not gonna stop there. We're gonna chill today.
[574.12s -> 578.60s]  I'm gonna play Picross, and I'm gonna not answer any questions at all about anything,
[579.32s -> 583.08s]  because I can't. So, let's just hang out for a while. Just leave already.
[583.76s -> 585.68s]  Just leave.
[585.68s -> 588.32s]  No, I can't leave right now. I'm here. I'm right here.
[588.84s -> 602.59s]  Somebody said that- did somebody say that was a really shitty direct? Can you imagine if that was a direct? Is this-
[603.11s -> 608.19s]  like, Doug Bowser comes on the screen. He's like, alright, so, I mean, I can't really talk about any of this stuff,
[608.19s -> 610.19s]  but like, I mean, like, Mario's cool.
[610.19s -> 615.99s]  We got this Mario guy, and like, I mean, you might see him. Maybe. I don't know. I don't have any fucking idea.
[616.03s -> 618.93s]  Thanks for all the support, guys, on like, Mario 2.
[619.23s -> 624.57s]  It's like a 10-minute thing of him just bumbling around, just not answering questions.
[624.65s -> 635.05s]  He's actually- he's like, somebody Google me a generic PR statement in front of, like, a
[635.69s -> 644.10s]  gray-white background where he's just sitting there, like, green-screened in. You're so handsome. I'm not even on screen.
[644.14s -> 658.31s]  Do you think your surgeon will recognize you as the Among Us guy? I hope so.
[658.93s -> 665.22s]  Although, maybe not. I kind of hope not. Don't you feel like he would, like, deliberately kill me?
[667.74s -> 670.98s]  Oh, you're the Among Us guy. Yeah, that's me. Oh, wow.
[671.46s -> 679.65s]  He's like the, like, the gas and like the, like, the anesthesia's going in. I fucking hate that meme.
[679.91s -> 683.40s]  You're never gonna wake up again. I'm just like,
[685.90s -> 689.26s]  right before- I gotta get my, I gotta get my last thing out right before I die.
[689.34s -> 691.34s]  I'm just right before I go out. I'm like,
[691.42s -> 693.79s]  that was pretty sus.
[694.91s -> 709.14s]  We get a face cam? No. Why did you moan?
[709.98s -> 713.50s]  No, that was like, I'm going under from the anesthesia.
[713.82s -> 720.23s]  Like, nobody- you don't know what sound you make when you're under anesthesia, when you go, like, have surgery.
[720.35s -> 723.91s]  They make you count back for some ten, and then you just wake up in a bed.
[724.11s -> 728.34s]  You don't- who knows what you could be- sound you can make, and it's like,
[728.34s -> 730.34s]  ugh, or, ooh, or, ugh.
[730.90s -> 735.50s]  Those of you that have had anesthesia before, you just, like, you're sitting there.
[736.02s -> 741.10s]  Okay, I'm lying here. I'm ready. I guess I- I guess- I'm- I woke up in a bed. Oh.
[742.43s -> 745.10s]  What happened? Oh, it's done. Oh.
[745.54s -> 747.78s]  All right, weird.
[750.10s -> 759.22s]  Who knows what sound you make? I mean, stop, stop. What? Like, in a hospital.
[769.77s -> 773.25s]  Don't get too excited that I'm not playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[773.25s -> 775.25s]  I'm just playing the soundtrack for you.
[775.61s -> 780.28s]  A lot of people really just got really excited because that's the intro to Heroes of Might and Magic.
[780.28s -> 785.98s]  It's like, no, we're playing Picross. That's one of the nice OST.
[788.92s -> 792.09s]  Oh my god, he's gonna minimize and he's gonna be in the next campaign!
[792.89s -> 802.16s]  So we're gonna play Picross and just chill. I can't wait to talk about some of these things.
[804.65s -> 811.46s]  Play- play Heroes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We'll do that when I- I don't know. I don't know.
[811.46s -> 812.66s]  We'll do it when I come back.
[812.66s -> 820.19s]  Yeah, what's that now? Let me just get back to- let me- let me figure out how to play this game again.
[820.19s -> 822.82s]  I think it's a cloud save file.
[823.69s -> 827.63s]  Let's do this one. Open this one. Can I open this? There we go.
[827.87s -> 833.04s]  So if you don't know how to play Picross, let me show you how it's done. I actually don't- I forget everything.
[833.60s -> 839.14s]  It's gonna- we're gonna take some learning here. It's been years since the last Picross stream.
[839.14s -> 846.50s]  Um, it's been, I don't know, like maybe like six, eight months? He's doing a tuber voice again.
[846.50s -> 851.30s]  What are you talking about? What do you mean? I'm not doing a tuber voice right now.
[851.78s -> 858.04s]  Stop getting in my head. So if you don't know how to play Picross, we'll do a quick TLDR first of all.
[859.02s -> 864.78s]  So these are squares that need to be filled in. So there needs to be 13 squares filled in on this
[866.24s -> 870.93s]  column, right? A row is this way. I don't know where they are. I just know there's 13 of them,
[870.93s -> 879.17s]  but I can deduce with logic, reasoning, and skill that I know where these could be, and it makes a picture.
[879.17s -> 886.54s]  Eventually, it makes a picture. Thanks for the tutorial. Everyone knows how to play Picross.
[886.54s -> 891.18s]  Oh really? Because when I played it a year ago, everyone was like, what is this garbage? Get it off the screen.
[891.18s -> 899.06s]  And then half of you got addicted to it the next day. So let me deduce here. So if this- how many- what is it? 15 by 15?
[899.66s -> 910.52s]  So that means that there has to be- this has to be correct. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[910.52s -> 916.38s]  Therefore, these middle ones have to be here. So now we have- we can- we can do some deduction.
[916.38s -> 922.17s]  Or can we? I'm not sure. So only four in this row. Can I do anything- and by the way,
[922.17s -> 926.01s]  but for those of you that have never played this before, if there is a space between numbers,
[926.01s -> 932.36s]  it means there has to be at least one space in between. Has to be. So for instance, if one was
[932.40s -> 938.46s]  right here, there would have to be a space for the next one. Have to be. That was incorrect.
[938.46s -> 946.66s]  Deduction Andy. Is your mother approved of this game? My mother plays this game, so I'm sure she does.
[946.66s -> 956.78s]  What about color? Color doesn't matter. Is it custom map? Oh yeah, oh yeah. Well, I'm just
[956.78s -> 959.66s]  gonna get back into the swinging things. We'll play the custom ones. We'll go in the workshop.
[959.66s -> 968.27s]  So it's 15. So 8, 9, 10, 11. So that means- hold on, let me see. I always hate when I don't get a
[968.27s -> 975.66s]  bunch of free ones down here. I need the bingo free space down here. 4, 1, 3, 3, 1.
[975.70s -> 985.42s]  This could be the 1. Single 8 means one square in the middle. Yeah, right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[985.98s -> 995.08s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Right, okay. So that has to be where-
[995.08s -> 1004.36s]  one of them has to be here. Has to be. Your mom plays this? This is Jeremy's mom playing.
[1004.36s -> 1010.41s]  It's pre-recorded. Is this too hard? It's not too hard. Trust me when I say it isn't.
[1010.94s -> 1020.82s]  Oh, what have I got? 10 here. 11. 5 and- hmm. The second 8. Oh, where is it? Where is it? Okay, here we go.
[1020.82s -> 1026.88s]  Yeah, because that's 8. Has to be 1 here. Then we got these two. This is part of the 5.
[1026.88s -> 1037.44s]  Has to be right. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I wonder. 3 and the 8. Oh, here we go. Yep.
[1037.44s -> 1044.24s]  Right, right, right. This is the 2. Alright, bingo. So check this out. See what we have just deduced?
[1044.24s -> 1049.54s]  Do you see what we just deduced? This has to be that 2. Block it off. There's your 2.
[1049.79s -> 1059.04s]  Now, 1 is somewhere over here. Are you guys excited about this yet?
[1059.04s -> 1065.84s]  Then that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This has to be right here. So this is part of the 1.
[1065.84s -> 1079.10s]  Check that out. This is one of the 1s. Because it can't be 1 here. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[1079.10s -> 1085.90s]  You got it. You're understanding it. I'm gonna drop a deuce. He-he-he-he-he. Alright, that's funny.
[1085.90s -> 1097.15s]  That's wicked funny. Did you catch the game last night? Did you have any hot fudge sundaes?
[1097.15s -> 1108.08s]  What grade are you in school? The brain hurts. Flap, flap. Let's go, let's go. This is a boomer game.
[1108.08s -> 1112.00s]  Yeah, well, I just told you I wanted to relax today. I wanted to tell you about some of the important
[1112.00s -> 1117.95s]  projects going on and the fact that I'm literally taking a 3-week break. Alright, what do I do?
[1117.95s -> 1121.47s]  Okay, I know I gotta tell them I'm like, I'm like taking like medical leave again. Oh, what?
[1121.47s -> 1128.06s]  Should I, should I play Picross for like a few hours and like tell them I'm leaving? Oh shit,
[1128.06s -> 1135.31s]  hold on. Wait a minute. This is important. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Bingo. Check this out.
[1135.31s -> 1141.81s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's got to be like here. It has to be here. This is part of the
[1141.81s -> 1152.29s]  four. It has to be somewhere in here, the five. Bingo. Tell mom to stream in your absence.
[1153.86s -> 1159.02s]  I would, my mother would take one second on the stream and look over and be like,
[1159.02s -> 1168.18s]  son, why do you do this? Why? Did you see what they were saying? And I'd be like, ma, ma, ma,
[1168.18s -> 1174.98s]  money. It's not, what do you mean money? I didn't raise you like that to care about money.
[1174.98s -> 1182.27s]  Be like, ma, ma, just, just relax. I'm making money. No, no, you're supposed to do it because
[1182.27s -> 1188.30s]  you love it and you love doing it. No, no, no. Oh, remember when you first made your first
[1188.30s -> 1193.33s]  YouTube video, how much you thought that was fun and how you were just doing it for fun.
[1193.33s -> 1203.42s]  Yeah, time to change, ma. No, not the son that I made. Ma, ma, get out of here, ma. You don't get
[1203.42s -> 1212.98s]  it. No, my son. And then I have a really deep realization like in like 45 minutes later in the
[1212.98s -> 1219.60s]  movie and I like understand now and I go back to like, like how I began and I like do it because
[1219.60s -> 1227.38s]  I love it. That's after I throw her in the volcano. By the way, just want to make sure you guys
[1227.38s -> 1239.50s]  understand where we are in the movie. Spoilers. All right, let's keep going. Let's get, we got to,
[1239.50s -> 1245.39s]  we got to deduce this. So this is part of the four. So if, okay, hold on. So this is the part
[1245.39s -> 1249.68s]  of the four. That means it has to be two ones after this. That means it would have to be,
[1249.68s -> 1255.07s]  it'd have to be this, right? This has to be where it is because there's no way this,
[1255.07s -> 1260.03s]  the four will fit. So this has to be the four. There you go. These are done. Pretty cool. Now
[1260.03s -> 1263.71s]  here we go. Perfect deduction. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Oh my God,
[1263.71s -> 1266.11s]  I'm sorry. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me. It's supposed to be a winding down
[1266.11s -> 1273.66s]  hangout stream where I tell you them. All right. So one, two, three, four. It cannot possibly be
[1273.66s -> 1279.78s]  higher than that. And it also cannot possibly be lower than this. Two, three, four. So here you go.
[1279.78s -> 1287.17s]  Ain't nothing over here, but it could be up here. This is also has to be part of the four. Therefore
[1288.93s -> 1295.54s]  one, two, three, four, nothing. It can't be over here. One, two, three, four. It could be
[1295.54s -> 1305.44s]  there, right? Technically. This is where it gets interesting. So this is part of the three,
[1305.44s -> 1313.01s]  the one, two, three, or one, two, three. This has to be the second three because one, two, three,
[1314.70s -> 1319.47s]  even if it was this way. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. It could be that. I don't know that
[1319.47s -> 1327.76s]  for certain. I can't be certain of that. I'm too dumb to understand this. Do the eight column.
[1327.76s -> 1332.94s]  Oh, right. We've got some more info here and here. So this has to be part of the eight.
[1332.94s -> 1337.86s]  I guess it doesn't have, what does it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. It does.
[1337.86s -> 1343.84s]  Okay. Does that give us any more info here? This is either two or the three.
[1343.84s -> 1351.94s]  This is the two. I feel like I'm in a zoom meeting, zoom class.
[1364.75s -> 1372.29s]  You know what? That is the worst insult ever. That's such an insult. Like it just is.
[1372.29s -> 1377.04s]  That's a perfect insult. You didn't say this stream sucks. You didn't say like, oh wow,
[1377.04s -> 1380.80s]  this is kind of boring. You said this is like a zoom meeting, dude. And it's like, that's
[1380.80s -> 1389.68s]  the worst thing where you could have described this at all as the teacher. All right. So let's
[1389.68s -> 1395.36s]  see. One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five could also go down here.
[1395.36s -> 1401.66s]  Yeah. We can do this one down here as well. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Therefore.
[1401.66s -> 1410.53s]  So these are good. One, two, three. Okay. So this is part of the two, which means this is
[1410.53s -> 1417.26s]  probably done. Yeah. That's definitely the two, which therefore this is gone. This has to be the
[1417.26s -> 1423.31s]  two, right? There's no way this is the three. This has to be the two. Look at how much we're
[1423.31s -> 1428.02s]  learning here. No, no, wrong, wrong, wrong. No, no, no. What do you mean? What, what, what?
[1428.02s -> 1435.28s]  Wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about? What's wrong? One, two, three, four, five.
[1436.08s -> 1441.82s]  One, two, three, four, five. Yeah. It could be, it has to be these three. I had it right.
[1443.87s -> 1450.37s]  This could be the five. Oh, wait. You're right. Because this could be like that. I see what you
[1450.37s -> 1457.02s]  mean. Okay. Yeah. Actually, I don't know that info. You're right. This is, this is not, this is the
[1457.10s -> 1462.11s]  three. Because there's no way this is the five. This is definitely part of the three.
[1462.75s -> 1466.88s]  So if it was one, two, three, there you go. Bingo. Okay. I don't know that for certain yet.
[1468.64s -> 1480.85s]  This teacher sucks. There are 12,000 people here. Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm, we're doing a,
[1480.85s -> 1487.25s]  but yeah, welcome everybody. All right. Where else can I go here? Can't do anything in here.
[1488.05s -> 1493.94s]  Or can I? Make a sentry noise so they don't leave. Well, if they're going to leave,
[1493.94s -> 1496.66s]  they're going to leave. I can't, I can't tell them, but they have to stay here.
[1499.20s -> 1504.82s]  You better not leave. Just make that really clear. Better not. What do you mean? Well, what if I
[1504.82s -> 1512.93s]  leave? Well, then you're going to miss something huge in the next 10 minutes. I'm going to play my
[1512.93s -> 1518.18s]  own Picross game so I don't get the urge to yell at you. Yeah. Pull it up, man. Let's go. All right.
[1518.18s -> 1523.66s]  Let's go down over here. So this is part of the five. There's a one over here somewhere.
[1529.25s -> 1532.85s]  Or one, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,
[1536.06s -> 1539.34s]  two. It could be either this way or this way. And it could be these two as well.
[1540.22s -> 1547.41s]  This is one of the threes. It could be either side because this is part of the three or the four.
[1547.41s -> 1554.00s]  Damn it. What about this eight? One. Oh yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1554.00s -> 1558.48s]  Cause we, we made some more room here. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[1558.48s -> 1569.15s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh shit. All right. Look at that.
[1571.30s -> 1580.38s]  We shaved off some space here. This is the five and the other eight as well. Can I do that though?
[1583.14s -> 1587.78s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[1587.78s -> 1593.86s]  seven. I don't have enough info for that. I don't think you dismiss us already. No, you're stuck here.
[1595.14s -> 1603.20s]  Well, I can do this though. So this is the three, which means one, two, three has to be here.
[1603.84s -> 1615.62s]  That's one, two, three, one, one, two, three, or one, two, three. Therefore this has to be one,
[1615.62s -> 1620.16s]  two, three, one, two. I don't know the info on that yet. Nevermind. I don't have the info.
[1621.84s -> 1631.30s]  The bell rang. Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats. All of you have detention now.
[1631.30s -> 1636.38s]  Every single person in the room in the class has detention. All of you. None of you are going
[1636.38s -> 1644.99s]  anywhere. You all have detention. Teacher, I'm hungry. No snacks allowed in my classroom either.
[1644.99s -> 1661.18s]  Bell doesn't dismiss us. Jerma does. I need to go to the bathroom. Well, sorry. The weird key
[1661.18s -> 1668.85s]  attached to the giant wooden plank that has the bathroom key on it is out right now. You're gonna
[1668.85s -> 1681.74s]  have to wait till Jerry comes back. All right. Let me focus. This is part of the five. I need
[1681.74s -> 1694.43s]  the top one here. I'm going to beat Jerry up. Well, now you're suspended. Not only do you have
[1694.43s -> 1700.72s]  detention, now I'm suspending you. Five. All right. Fuck. Pay attention. It's been a while
[1700.72s -> 1711.86s]  since I played Picross. I gotta get this right. Three, two, three, five. I feel like I can do
[1711.86s -> 1722.27s]  something here. One, two, three. Okay. I can do that. Oh, wait. Hold on. Yep. We can do this too.
[1722.91s -> 1729.82s]  Yep. All right. So here we go. Look at that. There's no way it could be eight here.
[1730.54s -> 1734.90s]  There's no way it could be. Yeah. Okay. So let's let's go over here. So we have one, two, three,
[1734.90s -> 1742.67s]  four. One, two, three, four. Fuck. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four,
[1742.67s -> 1757.01s]  five, six. There it is. Six. There it is. Oh, there it is. Genius. The picture sucks. Well,
[1757.01s -> 1762.40s]  you don't even know what it is yet. You can't know that yet. What does that do here? This has to be
[1762.40s -> 1769.18s]  the three. So it needs to be one, two, three, or one, two, three. Well, that's the only thing
[1769.18s -> 1776.45s]  I can deduce from there. Now this is part of the four. So one, two, three, four. Sorry. It ain't
[1776.45s -> 1785.41s]  there. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Okay. Teacher, I have to go. I have to go
[1785.41s -> 1798.48s]  to the bathroom. Look. Do you all have to go to the bathroom? Everybody has to go to the bathroom?
[1800.78s -> 1804.06s]  Well, I don't know how. There's how many stalls and how many urinals are in the bathroom? I don't
[1804.06s -> 1813.94s]  know. Jerry's vaping. I can see. Oh, Jerry's vaping. I can see him out the window. He's out
[1813.94s -> 1821.79s]  there like behind one of the trees outside the school vaping. Oh, no. What's he doing? What's
[1821.79s -> 1825.15s]  he doing? Oh, no. He's spinning around. He's spinning around. He's got the wooden key to the
[1825.15s -> 1832.90s]  bathroom. Oh, he just threw it up on the roof. You little shit. He's running. He's gone. He's
[1832.90s -> 1839.17s]  taken. Someone's going to call his mom. Okay. Um, well, let me, let me come over here and call the
[1839.17s -> 1845.66s]  janitor. Pick up the phone. Pick up the office phone. Yeah. We're going to need the janitor to
[1845.66s -> 1853.28s]  come down here. We need another key to the bathroom. Jerry, you always, you always just making
[1853.28s -> 1863.98s]  trouble. Okay. So where are we? Eight. I do any more here? I think, yeah, I can. The same exact
[1863.98s -> 1874.67s]  thing. Ooh, I did it. That's a three. Four is part of the five. Wiggly. Oh my God. I'm not even
[1874.67s -> 1881.12s]  paying attention. I'm getting so many subs. What the? Don't swear. Stop swearing. Oh my God.
[1885.84s -> 1892.86s]  Imagine, look, people stream themselves doing all kinds of wild shit. Imagine a teacher streaming
[1893.50s -> 1900.91s]  and like thanking subs in the middle of the class. Hey, nuclear waffle. Thanks for the 25 community
[1900.91s -> 1907.97s]  subs. It cutesy. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Lone K five community subs. Tank top typhoon,
[1907.97s -> 1915.65s]  five community subs. AWP five community subs. 25 community subs from Wiggly Joe. 25. Thank you.
[1917.94s -> 1924.85s]  Anyways, Genghis Khan, when he claimed, when he took over China, he was,
[1925.89s -> 1929.81s]  all right, guys, I got some subs. So give me a minute. You would never learn anything in that
[1929.81s -> 1939.44s]  classroom. Nothing. It would just be the teacher shouting out subs. That was a recycled doctor
[1939.44s -> 1945.12s]  joke. There's a bunch of new people here. I can recycle old material like a doctor doing surgery.
[1945.12s -> 1955.62s]  Okay. So the sick, the row of six, take a look at this. This is really interesting. Those of you
[1955.62s -> 1961.39s]  that don't know how to play this game. So I have blocked off places where there's no way it could
[1961.39s -> 1965.95s]  be six. There's not enough space for it. So it has to be down here. Therefore one, two, three, four,
[1965.95s -> 1969.63s]  five, six. You love when that happens, don't you? Don't you just love when that happens?
[1970.43s -> 1976.51s]  The row is done here and now we have more info. So if you understand this, now this has to be
[1976.51s -> 1982.11s]  one of the fours. Take a look at that. Absolutely clean. This is the three over here. So this has
[1982.11s -> 1987.07s]  to be part of the five. Really cool. Really, really cool that we're able to deduce that,
[1987.71s -> 1993.63s]  deduce that. This is part of the four. Therefore one, two, three, four, can't be over here. One,
[1993.63s -> 1998.19s]  two, three, four, can't be over here. What does that do for us here, folks? What does that do for
[1998.19s -> 2008.85s]  us here, class? What are you doing? How long does this bit last? This is not, there's no bit. I'm
[2008.85s -> 2018.14s]  playing pick-ross. You hate Tetris, but love this. Yes, because I have more than three seconds to
[2018.14s -> 2024.06s]  make a decision. I can turn away from the computer screen and talk over here about a
[2025.18s -> 2029.58s]  12-year-old shot putting a bathroom key under the roof and I didn't lose the game.
[2030.30s -> 2042.61s]  What are you talking about? All right, so that's done. No new info here. It probably is. No,
[2042.61s -> 2048.19s]  it's not. Oh, it can't be here. Look at this. Nice. Okay, cool. Cool. All right, now we've got more
[2048.19s -> 2053.23s]  info. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Take a look at that.
[2053.23s -> 2060.88s]  You've got your two. Now you've got your two and this is done because this has to be here.
[2061.60s -> 2074.00s]  That's not done. It doesn't know how to pause Tetris. You can pause Tetris. One, two, three,
[2074.00s -> 2081.33s]  four. One, two, three, four. Okay, can't do anything else here. One, two, three, four. One,
[2081.33s -> 2088.75s]  two, three, four. That's the five, right? There it is. All right, so now one, two, three, four, five.
[2088.75s -> 2093.87s]  One, two, three, four, five. Has to be here or here. Did that give us anything? There's the three
[2093.87s -> 2100.00s]  right there. Bingo. Got it. This is also part of the three. Can't be here. There's your three.
[2101.06s -> 2108.70s]  Done. Got it. Oh, speeding up. He's speeding up. He's getting on the freeway. Four. One, two, three,
[2108.70s -> 2117.17s]  four. Here we go. Take a look at that. I'm on a roll. X more things out. Oh, let me see. What
[2117.17s -> 2129.09s]  can I X out? Can't do this. Three, two, one. This has to be the two, right? Right? Yeah,
[2129.09s -> 2136.22s]  has to be. Get rid of that. Five and two. This could be one, two, three, four, five. Space one,
[2136.22s -> 2154.94s]  two. Can't decide that one yet. 13, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
[2155.90s -> 2168.77s]  13, 13. Okay. What the fuck is this? Isn't it not a stream game title? Why have you asked that?
[2168.77s -> 2174.88s]  Can't you? It's a stream title. It says it's wind down Andy and then it says playing
[2174.88s -> 2186.50s]  PictoPix. He's very sassy today. No, I'm faux sassy. No, it doesn't mean anything. One, two, three,
[2186.50s -> 2194.24s]  four. One, two, three, four. Oh, there's your one. I love when that happens. Joe Biden raid.
[2194.88s -> 2211.17s]  What the heck? Oh my God. Why do you X? I couldn't even read it. I don't even know what he said.
[2214.18s -> 2220.08s]  That's like funny about doing the big stream from like four days ago. Is there people that probably
[2220.08s -> 2223.52s]  that's the first time they'd watch the stream and they're like, whoa, what the heck? That was really,
[2223.52s -> 2227.28s]  that was really cool. I wonder what the next stream is probably going to be something.
[2227.28s -> 2232.00s]  It's pick cross. I'm just sitting here pick cross like yelling at my students in my fake classroom
[2234.94s -> 2242.40s]  and then I leave for three weeks. I got the most follows I think in one day, four days ago,
[2242.40s -> 2248.16s]  and I'll get the most unfollows a week from now when I haven't streamed. But whatever, you know,
[2248.16s -> 2265.81s]  like if you try the lasagna, it's my favorite. Here it is. Thirteen is done. That means I can't
[2265.81s -> 2272.70s]  do that one. Oh, one, two, three, four. One, two. Walk it off. Walk it off. Walk it off.
[2274.11s -> 2286.22s]  Four. One. That's done. Here's your four right here. One, two, three, four. Can't be here. Yeah,
[2286.22s -> 2296.18s]  like ice cream sundaes. One, two, three. Can I do this one? There's three. There's three.
[2297.06s -> 2302.02s]  Okay, let's do some cleanup here. I love this game. It's the most relaxing and fun thing ever.
[2302.82s -> 2308.14s]  Take out these whole rows. I'm going to assume it's probably here.
[2308.14s -> 2314.18s]  All right, that would be clean. We don't know that yet. What even is this picture?
[2314.18s -> 2322.91s]  It's like a swan or something. Don't guess. Four, four. Oh, here's the four.
[2324.67s -> 2330.34s]  What even is this thing? Three, six. Okay, we have our info here. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[2331.38s -> 2344.18s]  One, two, three, four, five, six. Cool. All right, does that do any worse? That's three and one.
[2344.18s -> 2349.89s]  We're looking for a two and a one over here. What about this five? One, two, three, four, five.
[2349.89s -> 2353.73s]  Got that one. This is part of the two. One, two. It has to be one, two here. It can't be up here.
[2355.90s -> 2363.49s]  Does that help us do anything else? Maybe a little. Here's three. Could be here. Could be here.
[2363.49s -> 2377.41s]  Don't guess. Do something funny, sus streamer. There's another one done. Suss. All right,
[2377.41s -> 2381.81s]  what else we got? That's two. Oh, here we go. Lock that off because the two is already done.
[2381.81s -> 2386.75s]  There's your six. There's your one. Done. There's your four. Done. There's your six.
[2388.32s -> 2395.84s]  Okay, there's your three. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. It can't be
[2395.84s -> 2403.09s]  these two. It's that one. There's your one. Now we need a two. It's got to be one there.
[2403.65s -> 2421.76s]  Please pee your pants and piss yourself when you beat the level. Oh, that was weird. Okay,
[2421.76s -> 2424.72s]  we're almost done. I have no idea what this image is, but we're almost done with it.
[2428.24s -> 2433.60s]  One, two, three. One, two, three, eight. All right, this row is done. I didn't even mean to
[2433.60s -> 2446.06s]  do that, but we did it. One, two, three, four, five. One. Nice. Okay, that clears out this row.
[2446.06s -> 2453.10s]  There's four here. It's four down here. Eight. There's one somewhere here. One there.
[2454.14s -> 2465.34s]  Hold on. One, two, three, four, five. What did that do? It gave me something else. It's eight.
[2465.34s -> 2470.53s]  Eight, two. Bingo. There's a two. And there's your eight. I keep saying in there's your.
[2472.14s -> 2475.42s]  Oh, and there's your two. There's your eight. There it is. We got that. There's that one.
[2475.42s -> 2480.24s]  There's your two. There's your six. There's your five. I need something more interesting to say.
[2480.24s -> 2494.18s]  All right. Oh, we're done. Done. This is done. Is that? What picture is this? What is it?
[2495.17s -> 2501.55s]  It's a squirrel. It's a squirrel. It's a squirrel with a big tail. Oh, wow. I thought it was a swan.
[2502.11s -> 2514.32s]  That was cool. You know, I did see people say squirrel. Blue star. Better than one.
[2514.88s -> 2519.52s]  There's your two. There's your three. There's your four. There's your two.
[2521.28s -> 2532.62s]  All right. What about this one? Oh, all right. Well, this one. Oh, that's interesting.
[2533.18s -> 2541.14s]  This one's got some. This is 15. Maybe we can go in here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[2541.14s -> 2548.72s]  eight, nine, ten, eleven, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Cool. So the nine then
[2549.52s -> 2555.33s]  is like in here, right? That's accurate. Seven is right in the middle. Or maybe not. I don't
[2555.33s -> 2564.54s]  know. I don't have that info. Nightgerma, enjoy the break. Thank you. I'm going to try to do as
[2564.54s -> 2569.25s]  much as I can. A lot of stuff going on. And I want to make sure I make this clear again,
[2569.25s -> 2572.45s]  because a lot of new people trickled in from the beginning of the stream about 40 minutes ago.
[2572.93s -> 2580.14s]  Um, let's make this as short as we can. Tons of stuff in the works, stuff I can't talk about.
[2580.86s -> 2585.49s]  I have a lot of major announcements when I come back. Leaving to take care of some personal
[2586.13s -> 2590.21s]  family and medical things once and for all, trying to close the book on that medical shit.
[2590.21s -> 2595.14s]  Going to try to get a procedure as fast as I can in this month. Reason for that is because
[2595.14s -> 2601.81s]  there's so much stuff going on in the next six months that I have to get it under control. So,
[2601.81s -> 2604.38s]  and if I don't, then it's going to be a real pain in the ass for me.
[2604.86s -> 2612.91s]  Well, I'll be back on April 1st. And no, that's not a joke. I will be streaming on April 1st and
[2612.91s -> 2616.67s]  April 2nd. I will give the announcements on April 2nd because I can't do it on the 1st,
[2616.67s -> 2621.50s]  because then people are going to think it was made up and it was a joke. I'll be back on April 1st.
[2621.50s -> 2631.20s]  And hopefully by then I would have had a procedure to deal with this costochondritis
[2632.08s -> 2638.02s]  disc spinal problem. We have no idea. We're still trying to figure out exactly what that is,
[2638.02s -> 2641.14s]  but at least I can get some injections to stop it from happening. Stop the
[2641.14s -> 2649.50s]  pain from showing itself all the time. That's the idea. Early April fool's pick raw stream.
[2649.50s -> 2654.14s]  Oh, I hope so. Okay. Here we go. This is part of the four. This is part of the two.
[2654.14s -> 2657.10s]  This is part of the four. This is part of the 11. This is part of the nine. This is part of the
[2659.17s -> 2670.66s]  part of the, ah, okay. This is part of the, let's do it one at a time. One, two, three, four.
[2671.62s -> 2680.35s]  This is part of the four. Sorry. Seven. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. One,
[2680.35s -> 2689.38s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven. That's some new deduction. Does that give us anything here?
[2689.38s -> 2696.77s]  We've got the one. Um, I don't, this might not be part. I don't know if that's part of the one.
[2696.77s -> 2705.73s]  This could be part of the three. That could be part of the three. The one column. I mean,
[2705.73s -> 2725.62s]  no, the one middle column one. Oh, right. I see what you mean. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
[2726.26s -> 2736.10s]  You're going to do a health updates on Twitter. I will. If there is a procedure I'm going to do,
[2736.10s -> 2741.36s]  I will tell you exactly what it is and exactly what that recovery time will be on it. But
[2741.36s -> 2745.76s]  make no mistake about it. I'm ready to close the book on this. It's been like three years.
[2749.02s -> 2757.79s]  And although I was fine after the geode archaeology stream for like three days plus
[2757.79s -> 2764.27s]  after that, it was tight. It was sore. And I'm just like, I have like, I have to get more.
[2764.27s -> 2777.94s]  We got to do something about this. Like now he has big balls. Um, why? Just, just, just,
[2778.82s -> 2783.14s]  just deny that. Just say, stop. No, why? I'm not talking about this. What the fuck am I doing?
[2784.11s -> 2788.99s]  Listen, who doesn't, what the fuck's happening? Just say that was weird. Don't say that there.
[2788.99s -> 2794.43s]  There you go. That was weird. Don't say that done. I'm done. I don't know. Why do I have to like
[2794.43s -> 2800.24s]  reply to that? Like just, that was weird. Don't say that done. Where are we going? Here we go.
[2800.24s -> 2812.06s]  This is the, what I was trying to do before. I love this. This, this sounds like really scary.
[2813.57s -> 2820.80s]  It could be that way or one, two, three, four, five. Hmm. Okay. You guys taking guesses of what
[2820.80s -> 2826.27s]  this is? I'm going to say it's a boat. I think this is a boat with the eight. Yep. Hold on.
[2827.42s -> 2834.21s]  One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hold on a minute. One,
[2834.21s -> 2839.65s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Damn. Okay.
[2840.69s -> 2850.80s]  What do we got here? It's a toy boat. It could be, yeah, it is a toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[2850.80s -> 2854.16s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[2854.16s -> 2862.86s]  toy boat, toy boat. I, the music playing in my ear distracted me. It's a crab. I don't think it's a
[2862.86s -> 2871.98s]  crab. I think it's a boat. Hmm. Three or the eight. Probably the eight because then this would make
[2871.98s -> 2877.17s]  sense, right? This would be the four. Well, this is a guess. I know you're not supposed to do that
[2877.17s -> 2892.64s]  here, but I'm using enough reasoning to do this. I know you're not supposed to do that. I did it
[2892.64s -> 2904.58s]  anyways. Song is pretty scary. Mad. It's wrong. Okay. All right. All right. We're fine. Um, so
[2904.58s -> 2910.50s]  this is still eight. Any more? This is part of the three, three, five, one, two, three, four, five,
[2910.50s -> 2918.66s]  one, two, three, four, five. I can't do anything else here. Three, four, five, three, three, four,
[2918.74s -> 2928.21s]  five. Can't do anything with these ones either. Um, what about this row? I've been listening to
[2928.21s -> 2932.05s]  the Heroes of Might and Magic three soundtrack because it's one of the best. Oh my God. What
[2932.05s -> 2939.17s]  was it? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh shit. This was done. Oh man. Nice. Okay. Maybe it's not a
[2939.17s -> 2946.06s]  boat. Um, it's got really nice soundtrack and it's one of my favorite old PC games. So that's why
[2946.06s -> 2955.60s]  it's out here, man. Working with uncertain information. Yeah. I know. What does that do?
[2956.40s -> 2964.67s]  Oh, that helps a lot actually. Cause now that brings this in. I can add to this, can't I?
[2969.60s -> 2975.14s]  Okay. Added this, which is part of the five. Very nice.
[2975.86s -> 2980.42s]  With all this, cause there's no five there. Three can't fit in there. The seven can't fit in there,
[2980.42s -> 2984.90s]  but a seven can go up this way for sure. And that one is now done. That takes care of the seven.
[2985.62s -> 3007.12s]  It sounds like mouth sounds. We need mouth sounds. Two can't go here. Oh, hold on. One, two, three,
[3007.12s -> 3013.57s]  four. All right. What do we got here? This is, these could be the, I think these are the two ones,
[3013.57s -> 3019.14s]  or this could be the two, could it? Two, one, one, three. This is, this, this is possible to be the
[3019.14s -> 3041.12s]  two. I don't know that yet. Three, four, five, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Nice. Okay.
[3041.12s -> 3050.54s]  This is one, two, three, four. Everything else is done. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute. One, two,
[3050.54s -> 3060.38s]  three. Whoa. Oh, this is wrong. What happened? Oh shit. What happened? This is wrong. This is wrong.
[3067.47s -> 3076.70s]  Oh, this is all fucked up. Is it because I guessed? No, is it? Wait, hold on. I need to
[3076.70s -> 3092.62s]  backtrack a little bit. What happened here? Seven, four, eight. Let me get this one. Let me,
[3092.62s -> 3102.19s]  let me get this one. So this means, this row is the problem somehow, or this one.
[3102.99s -> 3117.42s]  This is why you don't guess. I can salvage it though. Hold on. I think this is still correct
[3117.42s -> 3124.80s]  though. It kind of has to be. One, two, three, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[3128.16s -> 3138.83s]  Start over. No, what do you mean start over? One, two, one, two, hold on. Relax. One, two, three,
[3138.83s -> 3145.41s]  four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five.
[3146.05s -> 3159.71s]  All right. Five, one, three. Eleven, two, one, one, three. Two, one, one, three.
[3160.75s -> 3169.68s]  It's been 10 minutes. You should be done by now. You're, you're, whatever. You're in detention
[3170.48s -> 3185.84s]  or something. I don't know. That's guessing. No, no, no, no, no, no. What did I just do? One,
[3185.84s -> 3193.36s]  two. Where was it? Over here. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. This is
[3193.36s -> 3215.70s]  right, right? Five, one, three. That was a guess. Column three and four. You can eliminate a lot
[3215.70s -> 3231.18s]  on the second row. Yeah, I can. That's eight. One, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five,
[3231.18s -> 3238.54s]  six, seven, eight. It has to be there, right? And then this is one, two, three, one, two, three,
[3238.54s -> 3250.29s]  four. Let's make, is this, do we got this right? Hey, do, do we got this? There's nine. Hey, do we
[3250.29s -> 3256.03s]  got this? Guys, I think we got this. None of you are clicking on the screen at all. It's me doing
[3256.03s -> 3272.91s]  this. Oh, we're so close. It's just me doing this. I think I fixed it. Okay. I, these, this is very
[3272.91s -> 3302.30s]  right to be wrong. I'll be honest with you. Fuck. Shit. One, two, three, four, five. Oh no, it's all
[3302.30s -> 3335.46s]  wrong. It's a bunny rabbit though. It's not a bunny. Where did this go so wrong? I did, it's this,
[3335.46s -> 3338.98s]  this junk here in the middle is what's good. Everything's good. This is correct over here,
[3338.98s -> 3378.38s]  I think. Shit. Five, one, three, something right here. Ah, no. It's cause I guessed on the one
[3378.38s -> 3388.74s]  educated guess and it fucked up the whole thing. I think it's, it's like one column is wrong.
[3388.74s -> 3394.66s]  I can salvage it. I know I can. Everything needs to be shifted like one square to the right.
[3395.38s -> 3426.77s]  I think this one's wrong. That'd be one. There's one. Okay. One, four, four. Hold on. Hold on. Four,
[3428.40s -> 3436.13s]  five. Oh, I have to fucking restart the whole thing. I have to restart. I've messed, I just
[3436.13s -> 3442.72s]  fucked something up. And when you mess one thing up, the whole project is over. Shit.
[3444.88s -> 3459.41s]  I hate it. I hate it. All right. All right. I still want to, I want to do another one. I just
[3459.41s -> 3474.67s]  fucked the whole thing up. I fucked everything up. Is that nine? One, two, three, four, five,
[3474.67s -> 3478.75s]  six, seven, eight, nine. All right. See if I was lying in my bed doing this shit, I would just like,
[3479.71s -> 3495.66s]  I would just go, oops. And restart it like five times. Four, eight, eight, three, four, five,
[3495.66s -> 3506.86s]  six, seven, eight. Okay. Relax. Two, three, four, five. Two, three, four, five. That looks good.
[3507.58s -> 3511.79s]  You only, you don't, you cheated the, can you explain this more? Sure. I actually will. Because
[3511.79s -> 3516.42s]  then a lot of people were not here the last time I played this. So the whole goal here is to make
[3516.42s -> 3522.72s]  a picture. I'm giving some information. By the way, this game is way cooler than Sudoku.
[3523.60s -> 3529.92s]  So if I'm sorry, but Sudoku is shit in comparison to this. But if you've played Sudoku,
[3529.92s -> 3535.30s]  it's about numbers on the edges that you have to fill squares in. This one, you have to make a
[3535.30s -> 3541.86s]  picture. Each one of these rows and columns has this many squares filled in on this space here.
[3544.16s -> 3552.14s]  So in this row, there is five in a row, one, and three in a row. In between these three numbers,
[3552.14s -> 3561.02s]  there has to be one full unoccupied space. Has to be. And the idea is you have to logically deduce
[3561.02s -> 3567.66s]  where those squares are filled in based on the knowledge they give you. At least one. Yes,
[3567.66s -> 3572.86s]  yes, at least one. It could be one, it could be five spaces. Has to be at least one space.
[3572.86s -> 3581.12s]  Sudoku is sick as fuck. Oh, we have some Sudoku people in here that think that Sudoku is better
[3581.12s -> 3587.97s]  than Picross. Yeah, hey, hey, hey, back to the Sunday newspaper, right, Grandpa?
[3589.57s -> 3596.94s]  Hey, how's that Lady Superstar on a Foxtrot, Grandpa and the Funnies?
[3596.94s -> 3616.42s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I can't deduce that. It was a really weird laugh too.
[3616.42s -> 3621.14s]  I'm sorry about that. Okay, so no more guessing. Get this right. Don't be an idiot.
[3622.40s -> 3639.26s]  You're a boomer for even knowing what Foxtrot is. Why? Six column, the six column,
[3639.26s -> 3648.05s]  six column, the six column. I thought this was, okay, hold on. Three, four, five, six.
[3648.85s -> 3655.30s]  One, two, three, four, five, six. Very cool. All right, so this is where I got screwed up last time.
[3655.30s -> 3661.30s]  This has to be part of the five. One, two, three, four, five. Let's just say it's right here. One,
[3661.30s -> 3670.70s]  two, three, four, five, space one, space one, two, three. This is not part of the three. It's
[3670.70s -> 3682.86s]  part of the five. Tell me I'm wrong here. One, two, three, four, five. This has to be the five.
[3683.42s -> 3696.91s]  That's good to know. That's not a guess. That's not a guess. Okay, let's keep going. Doing that
[3696.91s -> 3710.26s]  allows me to go like this. One, two, three, four, five. That's a correct move. Yeah. You're at 500,000?
[3711.06s -> 3716.18s]  I'm not at 500,000. It might happen this stream, and if it does, then oh my God,
[3716.18s -> 3722.59s]  you're going to hit me celebrate. You're not doing this fast enough to satisfy my satisfaction.
[3725.42s -> 3737.60s]  Wait, did I read that right? Okay. Stop. Stop. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[3738.16s -> 3757.62s]  five, six, seven. Thank you. Correct. Correct. All right, I'm slowly deducing.
[3760.80s -> 3770.74s]  Hmm. Five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All right. Okay. This is where it got
[3770.74s -> 3775.78s]  messed up last time. I'm not at 500,000 yet. I have a monitor right here that shows it.
[3776.67s -> 3785.02s]  We're at 499,576. I have the live real-time data. You're not. No, I'm not. Refresh the page.
[3785.58s -> 3805.39s]  I don't have 500,000 followers. I have 499,576. Debated. That's actually really cool.
[3806.03s -> 3810.51s]  Weren't we just talking about how I passed 200,000 like six months ago or something?
[3810.51s -> 3816.94s]  What's happening? All right. This is where I got messed up last time. I just made it an assumption.
[3816.94s -> 3832.53s]  Three, four, five, space one. It's probably right here, right? I mean, come on. Come on, right? It
[3832.53s -> 3841.10s]  has to be. That's a guess, but that is a really good guess. That's assuming. It has to be there.
[3841.98s -> 3846.40s]  It can't be anything else. That's not an assumption. That is a deduction from logical reasoning.
[3850.22s -> 3867.39s]  No, it has to be there. There's nowhere else it can be. No, I can see a real-time clicker,
[3867.39s -> 3875.23s]  a ticker of what I have for subs right now. No, I mean, for 500,000 subs. Oh, my God.
[3875.95s -> 3888.10s]  It rounds up. No, I'm at 499,600. That would be a billionaire.
[3890.30s -> 3896.62s]  Okay, so that was solved. I got that fixed from last time. One, two, three. One, two, three. There
[3896.62s -> 3903.34s]  you go. Therefore, one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. I got that done.
[3904.91s -> 3913.89s]  Is it crack time yet? I think it's been crack time since the stream started like an hour ago.
[3914.05s -> 3921.62s]  I blew this one too. I blew it. Now we go for it. That was the problem. I knew it was something
[3921.62s -> 3924.42s]  right here in the middle that you have to start over so you can see what the hell is going on.
[3924.98s -> 3937.78s]  Very cool. Now I got this. Okay, now I did this. It can't be there. These are ones that can't be
[3937.78s -> 3947.14s]  played. They can't be done. I just lost 100 followers. I think something you guys don't know.
[3947.94s -> 3956.24s]  I'll tell you right now. There's so many people are coming and going on this stream. It's really
[3956.24s -> 3960.50s]  weird to look at. Would you guys like to know how many people unfollowed the stream?
[3962.50s -> 3969.01s]  Three days ago. Where can I see that info? I know I can see it. Can I?
[3969.57s -> 3985.62s]  It was unfollowed. I know I can see it. I'm unfollowing right now. The music is fitting.
[3986.82s -> 3991.54s]  I don't have the data right in front of me. Just to let you know, hundreds of people potentially
[3991.54s -> 3998.06s]  unfollow a day. I don't even know who they are. I don't know where they came from. I have no idea.
[3998.54s -> 4003.18s]  Well, I don't know. Hundreds of people follow and hundreds of people unfollow every day.
[4003.90s -> 4012.56s]  It's something like that. What's the noise? I don't know. My window's open. There's crickets
[4012.56s -> 4022.74s]  and shit out there. There's also a full band out there too. Pretty nice though. I'm going to keep
[4022.74s -> 4036.29s]  the window open. All right, let's keep going. This is much better. Okay. Now, no guessing.
[4036.93s -> 4048.29s]  It's definitely not there. Three. It can't be there. It could be here and it could be here.
[4048.93s -> 4054.38s]  Four. One, two, three, four. Yeah. Is it there already? Okay. One, two, three, four. Can't be
[4054.38s -> 4061.60s]  there. Three, four. Okay. One, two, three, four. Can't be here. One, two, three, four. Can't be
[4061.60s -> 4068.37s]  there either. Interesting. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Which gave us this. Which
[4068.37s -> 4078.80s]  gave us the seven which means we can do one two three four five six seven one two three four five
[4078.80s -> 4095.86s]  six seven okay no guessing it's the audio this is outside why are you playing a math game

[4247.17s -> 4256.86s]  okay i'm so good i did not guess that's not happened we're good i don't know if this is a
[4256.86s -> 4264.05s]  one or a two this is the three one two three shit okay hold on let me do something here
[4264.05s -> 4284.47s]  here. I'm so nervous now. I don't know why. Why would I be nervous? Okay. Well, that's
[4284.47s -> 4304.50s]  done. This is it. Okay. Cool. What did that do for me? Two? Maybe the one? What did that
[4304.50s -> 4319.86s]  do here? Seven. Where is it? Oh, right. You're right. Thank you. Nice. Nine. Oh, now I, okay.
[4319.86s -> 4328.41s]  Hold on. I can do this now. Two, three, four, five, six, seven. Can't be there. Five, six,
[4328.41s -> 4347.54s]  seven, eight, nine. Five, six, seven. It's a guess. Can't do that. Eleven. Eleven. Good.
[4347.54s -> 4356.82s]  I can't. I can't do that yet. I can't do it. I'm too nervous to do that. Too scared. This is
[4356.82s -> 4366.70s]  five. One, two, three, four, five. Can't be here. One, two, three, four, five. Right? No,
[4366.70s -> 4373.29s]  that's not accurate. One, two, three. It has to be one here though. Right? Three, four, five. Not
[4373.29s -> 4383.72s]  accurate. As I know it is. It's accurate. It's a crab. I don't think it's a crab. And you know
[4383.72s -> 4393.62s]  what? It's probably a fire. Maybe a flame. Three and the eight. Three and the eight. Right. Okay.
[4393.62s -> 4404.24s]  So then this is, I got, I messed this up last time. One, two. This has got to be the eight.
[4408.16s -> 4429.23s]  This has to be like this. Three, four, five. Is it a bird? I think it might be a plane. No,
[4429.23s -> 4438.08s]  of course not. It's Superman. Give me the fucking minus twos. Give them to me. Give me. Give me
[4438.08s -> 4441.92s]  them. I want to see them. I want only the chat to be fucking minus twos. It's all I want to see.
[4441.92s -> 4450.78s]  I better see it. Make me feel fucking horrible. Make me. I deserve it. Okay. This is done. There's
[4450.78s -> 4457.38s]  one. Is it the second one or the first one? Because if this is the second one, then this
[4457.38s -> 4492.51s]  is the three. Okay. I can't, don't guess. I got to put my like singer spin on it. Is that row done?
[4492.59s -> 4500.98s]  Is that row done? Have we talked about this? But like anytime somebody does a song that's very,
[4502.02s -> 4509.06s]  the Mario theme song is very, there's no, it's just dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[4509.06s -> 4514.90s]  It's like the national anthem. Like dun dun dun dun dun dun. But when you get like then the
[4514.90s -> 4520.10s]  singer syndrome, you have to make it your own. You have to make it different. It can't just be like,
[4521.23s -> 4530.42s]  oh, say, can you see? No, it's going to be like, oh, say, can you see? Like they have, you have to
[4530.42s -> 4538.05s]  do your own like, wow, it's going to be, I got to make it different. Nobody just like sings a song
[4538.05s -> 4548.69s]  that's a very old like song that everybody knows. You have to give it your spin. True. Yeah. That's
[4548.69s -> 4559.50s]  always annoying. Well, I mean, I'm just telling you how it is. You did the same joke from the
[4559.50s -> 4566.30s]  Fear 2 stream. All right. Well, let's, hey, how many words have I spoken in the English? Okay.
[4566.30s -> 4571.18s]  Do this for me. I want one of you to do this because we'll see if that's the case. I don't
[4571.18s -> 4577.33s]  know how many words I've spoken on stream. I've said every word in the dictionary,
[4578.74s -> 4584.80s]  like a hundred times each. I've said every fucking possible sentence. Like I've talked
[4585.76s -> 4591.52s]  50 million words. I'm going to backtrack onto one of some of those words sometimes.
[4591.52s -> 4599.28s]  I've said 500 million words on this stream. You said that same joke in the Fear 2 stream
[4599.28s -> 4608.58s]  back in like 2017. You're a liar. All right. Well, this is done.
[4608.58s -> 4671.78s]  I'm so sorry. Hey, remember that? Like how many unfollows am I going to get in a day?
[4672.42s -> 4687.14s]  Oh, we're almost done. Oh, what is it? What's it going to be? It's a bat. It's a bat. Yeah,
[4687.14s -> 4701.39s]  this is a bat for sure. It's a bat. It's a bat. You're embarrassing me. You're getting
[4701.39s -> 4712.85s]  secondhand embarrassment because I'm annoying. Oh, very cool. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah. I haven't
[4712.85s -> 4722.42s]  done this one yet. I remember this one. I love that one. I mean, listen to quake two. Um,
[4723.62s -> 4732.61s]  this one's going to be hard. 15 by 15, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. So there'll be two spaces.
[4732.85s -> 4742.66s]  Um, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I just thought my connect. I just like my connect.
[4742.66s -> 4751.04s]  I thought it was falling down on me. I just freaked out. This one is hard. Yeah, it is six.
[4751.60s -> 4765.63s]  It's 1112. Yeah. What we could do is so let's say it was so two, let's just do this. Like
[4765.63s -> 4771.09s]  let's just say it was this way space this way, right? That's like, that's not accurate,
[4771.09s -> 4777.65s]  but that's like, will give us some space here to work with. So technically this can be blocked
[4777.65s -> 4784.90s]  off like that temporarily. That's guessing. Yes, I know. If I do one, two, three, four, five, six,
[4784.90s -> 4796.10s]  seven, and then one space two, we have this whole quadrant is, oh, that's guessing. I know,
[4796.10s -> 4802.18s]  but technically speaking, I should have this much like room at least deduce that. Yeah, that's
[4802.18s -> 4809.90s]  accurate. Let me do what I'm doing. One, two space one space. So like I have this much room to work
[4809.90s -> 4817.68s]  with for the seven. I was right. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three,
[4817.68s -> 4822.72s]  four, five, six, seven. The seven that has to be like that. It's impossible for it not to be.
[4828.21s -> 4837.81s]  I can hurry up. Timer's going up. Okay. Same deal with the other ones. So there's another group
[4837.81s -> 4845.07s]  that's like that, right? Six and the five. Let's just say it was one, two, three, four, five space
[4845.07s -> 4859.87s]  one, two, three, four, five, six. That means that I have to, I'm getting intense. I think from here
[4859.87s -> 4870.48s]  I can do, I was going to do it. And now ladies and gentlemen here to do for the, before the baseball
[4870.48s -> 4876.61s]  game, the sped up time of hurry up. You've got to get to the end of the Mario level. We've got
[4876.61s -> 4880.64s]  Jeremy Albertson. Hey everybody.
[4889.44s -> 4893.44s]  Yeah.
[4915.60s -> 4926.61s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I don't know what to do on core. Turn on shuffle. Why?
[4926.61s -> 4935.36s]  All right. I need to deduce. Stop distracting me. I think that's my best bet. I really do one, two,
[4935.36s -> 4941.92s]  three, four, one, two, three, four, five space one, two, three, four, five, six. The six has
[4941.92s -> 4950.83s]  got to have one, two, three, four, five, six. Right. It has to be here somewhere. There has to
[4950.83s -> 4961.41s]  be three in a row here. I don't, I, I don't, it's, it's, that's tricky to, that's a, that's a guess,
[4961.41s -> 4975.84s]  but it allows me to do this. Are there 12 K people watching this? Because you, you, you got here too
[4975.84s -> 4985.28s]  late. I just, I just like, you should, you should have been here five minutes ago and my views have
[4985.28s -> 4996.27s]  been going crazy. If you could see what I did right before you got here, I did a handstand.
[4996.27s -> 5003.76s]  Oh, I'm so fucking exhausted. I did a handstand for an hour and we had a timer that was a one
[5003.76s -> 5010.30s]  hour handstand. Like, and you fucking missed it. I'm like exhausted and I had to sing the national
[5010.30s -> 5014.32s]  anthem upside down and drink like milk upside down and shit. It was a big like follower thing
[5014.32s -> 5018.24s]  that we did. I had 500,000 followers today. It's not normally this many, but there's usually like,
[5018.24s -> 5023.86s]  maybe like a thousand people here. I don't know. This is crazy. It's a huge increase. I had to drink
[5023.86s -> 5027.78s]  milk upside down. It was like, and it went on my nose and stuff and everybody's laughing and like,
[5027.78s -> 5033.68s]  the views just kept going. I mean, I, and I was like, I got to relax. That was ridiculous.
[5034.24s -> 5039.90s]  I rode like a horse in here. Like, you don't have, you don't idea what's going to happen the next in
[5039.90s -> 5050.48s]  the 500,000 follower stream. And like, I rode a horse around. Yeah. I'm tired. I just want to
[5050.48s -> 5053.20s]  play fucking Picross. I don't, I didn't just think there's many people going to be here.
[5054.24s -> 5065.57s]  Where should I go now? Rated like 20 times. Yeah. I remember, I remember favorite streamer X said,
[5065.65s -> 5071.09s]  holy shit, this guy's riding around on a horse. He just did a handstand and like drank a glass of
[5071.09s -> 5079.18s]  milk upside down. What's going there? All right, guys, we're going there. They all did it. It was
[5079.18s -> 5093.28s]  weird. It's crazy. Cross out the three row. Yep. That helps a lot. Even if this is a guess,
[5093.28s -> 5097.10s]  but it's, I think it's accurate. It gives us some more stuff to work with here. Okay.
[5098.56s -> 5111.60s]  Anything more than three in a row. Damn it. Oh, that sucks. Called networking. Milk keg stand
[5111.60s -> 5121.90s]  sounds awful. Yeah, it does. What kind of, what, what, why would we be doing milk out of a keg?
[5122.62s -> 5138.24s]  It seems really weird. That's like a prank. Oh man, we got ears. We got, we got bush light in here.
[5140.22s -> 5143.50s]  Let's get them up there. Yeah. Oh yeah. You want to do it? Yeah, I'll do a keg stand. Let's go.
[5143.50s -> 5148.13s]  All right. Take it off. Go ahead. Come on in. Put it in your mouth. All right. Let's jump upside
[5148.53s -> 5158.29s]  down. So tell them. This tastes something about this. Oh, it's milk.
[5161.74s -> 5188.24s]  Freshman drank milk. I do one. First character song. And this song is playing. Oh, fuck it.
[5188.24s -> 5211.73s]  Fuck this place. Drinking milk out of a keg. You lost viewers. All right. What do you want
[5211.73s -> 5216.61s]  me to say? I do. What do you want me to do? Like, whatever. If people are going to leave,
[5216.61s -> 5222.86s]  they're going to leave. All right. You losing viewers. Oh, well, whatever. Who cares?
[5224.22s -> 5230.86s]  There's 12, 15 million people live right now. If you don't want to listen to the Mario fast
[5230.86s -> 5235.26s]  song while I talk about chugging milk out of a keg while I sit here and just don't play the game,
[5235.26s -> 5240.40s]  then you're gone. There's somebody way more interesting you'll find. Is that accurate though?
[5240.40s -> 5252.03s]  Boom. All right. I'm done. Let me skip ahead. I don't want to hear this fucking shit anymore.
[5252.03s -> 5266.30s]  There we go. That's better. So let's just say that's that. Ego. I don't have an ego.
[5266.30s -> 5304.37s]  Say that anymore. Love. Whatever. Why are they all so fast? Go. Okay. There we go. Scary music.
[5312.13s -> 5316.02s]  Can I do this up here though? One, two, three. I can't do it up here.
[5316.66s -> 5327.22s]  Where am I going to find the place to start from? It's not here. I don't know if this is the two or
[5327.22s -> 5334.21s]  the three. I don't know what this could be. I don't know what this is either. You just did 10
[5334.21s -> 5344.83s]  minutes? What? This isn't PictoPix music. This is disarming a bomb music. Five, six column.
[5345.71s -> 5350.11s]  I can't do this though. One, two, three, four, five. I don't have enough. This is just guessing.
[5350.11s -> 5374.05s]  This is a straight up guess. Okay. Yeah. I didn't die. Nope. 499, 789. I think I think I'd rage
[5374.05s -> 5391.63s]  put this one. I don't like this one. Five, six. I can't do the five, six. How could be down? I
[5391.63s -> 5397.26s]  maybe I could just maybe these two in here. Like it would have to be like one of these two, right?
[5398.22s -> 5410.80s]  It has to be that though. It has to be. But that doesn't help me at all. The blue wire. I'm going
[5410.80s -> 5430.56s]  so slow. Yeah, this is a guess, but that doesn't even give me that much info. I mean, technically
[5430.56s -> 5440.26s]  speaking, I could guess and this could be like six could be down here, right? Could be that. And
[5440.26s -> 5450.42s]  then this could be part of the four, one, two, three, four. Then this is done. Do not guess.
[5451.14s -> 5464.02s]  Don't guess. Look behind you. I'm fine. Seven. I can't do anything with the sevens. There's
[5464.02s -> 5476.45s]  nothing more than a four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Remember you suck at this.
[5476.45s -> 5488.40s]  Okay, we're done with Mario. I'm done with this hurry the fuck up music.
[5490.72s -> 5498.48s]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, to sing the Mario Galaxy opening theme song for the entrance of our
[5498.48s -> 5518.38s]  baseball game. German 985. He seems to be frozen. He's clenching the mic very, very tightly in both
[5518.38s -> 5525.52s]  of his hands with his eyes wide open. He's supposed to have been singing by now. Somebody get down
[5525.52s -> 5531.17s]  there. Get down there. He's frozen. He's done. He's clenched completely. Now he can't do it.
[5533.18s -> 5540.48s]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. German 985. Catch him on Twitch. Somebody get him the fuck
[5540.48s -> 5548.42s]  out of here. Get him. Go get him. Just can the music. Go to the interlude shit. Interlude,
[5548.42s -> 5570.58s]  interlude. Thank you. Go get him. Wait, I might be naked in this image. It's like three guys just
[5570.58s -> 5574.58s]  with one arm on my back just like moving me and I'm just slowly walking just clenching the fucking
[5574.58s -> 5581.52s]  microphone. And then it all what an embarrassing fucking last ditch effort. I start to sing.
[5583.55s -> 5590.29s]  Oh, everyone's clapping. He's almost off. He's almost off the field. Get him off. Okay.
[5595.76s -> 5614.24s]  And they cut the mic. They like pull the cord. I'm rage quitting this one. I can't do it.
[5615.78s -> 5619.62s]  For me to do these, I need like the one guaranteed space that I know I can do. And
[5619.62s -> 5636.10s]  there's none of them here. Fuck. Just guess. Try the five by five one. I have to guess.
[5636.98s -> 5652.48s]  I have to guess. I'm guessing. Whatever. Therefore, this is two two. They're all such
[5652.48s -> 5658.67s]  little numbers. Like, what the fuck? This one sucks. That didn't even help me.
[5664.69s -> 5675.65s]  Five, six, seven. I just have to take a wild guess. Whatever. So this is four, maybe the two, three,
[5676.61s -> 5690.24s]  vertical four, two, two. You sing the decay rap. I think I've done that before.
[5691.60s -> 5697.38s]  Too many low numbers. I don't like, I hate that. I like having the little, little numbers.
[5697.38s -> 5708.10s]  Four, two, two. I don't know if that's accurate up here. Three, three, one, two, three, or one, two,
[5708.10s -> 5721.02s]  three. That's all I can do from that. Three row, three, three row, three column. What are you saying?
[5721.10s -> 5727.71s]  You can do the horizontal two, four, two. Okay. Let's just say this is the last two,
[5728.27s -> 5734.03s]  which I might not even be. It could be that. I don't have it. I can't do it. I don't have
[5734.03s -> 5747.87s]  enough info. Where is the fucking info? There's no info for this. I'm guessing. I'm trying not
[5747.87s -> 5756.45s]  to guess. Where's the sure thing? Where is the sure thing on this list? I don't see it.
[5757.41s -> 5765.71s]  Four, two, two. Vertical is a sure thing. One, two, three, four, one, two, space one, two.
[5766.67s -> 5774.24s]  Vertical four, two, two is a sure thing. Where? How? The two, two's could be anywhere. They could be
[5774.24s -> 5779.78s]  here. They could be here, here. It could be two, space two. It could be two, space two. They could
[5779.78s -> 5792.32s]  be anywhere. Fourth row down on that row. One, two, three, four. Make progress. You can do it.
[5792.32s -> 5805.55s]  I believe in you. This is a guess though. I think this one just sucks. Look at all these dumb one,
[5805.55s -> 5809.47s]  two, one, one, two, one, one, two, two, two. It's like, no, get out of here. This one's stupid.
[5816.02s -> 5821.89s]  Four, okay. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Now does it go this way or this way? The two.
[5823.01s -> 5835.06s]  No idea. Vertical seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5835.70s -> 5844.75s]  Okay. This is two, four, two. This, there's the one, one. Is that, but that, if I guessed,
[5844.75s -> 5849.49s]  I took a guess. I have no idea if that's accurate or not. I've done, how am I supposed to know that?
[5855.23s -> 5859.95s]  It's not a guess. It is a guess though. I had to deduce that and I had to make an educated guess
[5859.95s -> 5865.52s]  to get this even in the first place. Okay. Hold on. How are we doing? Now this is two, four.
[5867.68s -> 5872.40s]  There's your two. There's your four. Who knows where the hell the other two could be?
[5872.40s -> 5877.26s]  There's your three. That's done. All right. These are guesses. I don't know. I have no,
[5877.26s -> 5889.97s]  I don't know how to play the game. Two, two. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5890.69s -> 5904.66s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Should we be dancing? Getting there. All right. I need a,
[5905.54s -> 5922.90s]  uh, okay. Hold on. That's going to help a lot. Three, three, one. This is probably the three right
[5922.90s -> 5934.93s]  here. Right? Cause then it'd be two this way. Right? Yes. I think that's correct. No. What?
[5934.93s -> 5956.18s]  So this could be the one. I don't know. All right. Hold on. I feel, I really feel like it's like right
[5956.18s -> 5965.14s]  here. Three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is one. This
[5965.14s -> 5976.43s]  is probably the one. Yeah. It has to be. Three. This is a three here. One, two, three. Not there.
[5976.43s -> 5991.44s]  One, two, three. Can't be there. Okay. I wrote the soundtrack. What? What? Dude, did you seriously?
[5991.92s -> 5999.42s]  Are you serious? Oh my God. Welcome. Welcome. We need to welcome that person. Oh my God.
[6000.30s -> 6022.48s]  Hey, there's another one. Okay. That does do. I feel like this is nothing. They have to be over
[6022.48s -> 6035.58s]  here. Otherwise, what the hell is this connected to? Or right here, I'm assuming. You know where
[6035.58s -> 6051.33s]  to put the one. Do I? Yes, I do. Don't I? Right? Like that, that's pretty, that's pretty, that's
[6051.33s -> 6075.52s]  pretty close. Okay. Could be one too. No evidence. The music is making this worse.
[6079.49s -> 6083.89s]  Like I'll, I keep just seeing Mario running. Okay. So this is the ADHD is just fucking striking.
[6083.89s -> 6089.65s]  It's ugly head here. Like I'm playing this game in front of my screen, but I am seeing in my head
[6090.21s -> 6099.26s]  Mario running around on planets. Like I'm playing two games at the same time. I'm just in that game
[6099.26s -> 6106.34s]  in my head just playing it. And while I'm just here now, like I just collected a coin. I just got
[6106.34s -> 6111.78s]  like two coins. Oh yeah. Oh, I did the thing where you do, you spin around accidentally.
[6111.78s -> 6115.38s]  Cause the wee boat like crossed the plane. You didn't even mean to do it, but you get,
[6115.38s -> 6119.14s]  whoa, whoa. You get really annoyed by it for a second. Cause you're like, oh, I didn't fucking
[6119.14s -> 6137.09s]  want to do that. All right. Where are we here? This is two, four, seven, one. Where's that one?
[6138.03s -> 6149.04s]  Or, oh, okay. Hold on. Good. That's one of the twos. This has to be the four. Okay. So therefore
[6149.04s -> 6158.00s]  one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. That's a risky move right there. Cause this
[6158.00s -> 6161.52s]  has to be the only, that's the only one I could put there. Right? Wait one, two shit. It could be
[6161.52s -> 6174.82s]  here. Yes. I know. Yeah. I know. Stop playing Mario galaxy. I've stopped playing Mario galaxy.
[6174.82s -> 6185.41s]  I'm playing Mario galaxy in my head. Shit. I just did like a super jump from one gravitational
[6185.41s -> 6190.78s]  planet to the other gravitational planet. It was just like pulled me in and I went all the
[6190.86s -> 6207.28s]  way around the planet and went up and then landed. Okay. Hold on. Let me focus. This is,
[6209.25s -> 6212.29s]  if this is the other three right here, I know that's a guess, but one, two, three,
[6213.01s -> 6216.85s]  that means there's the other two. And then I have the four over here. I'm just going to,
[6216.85s -> 6220.93s]  I'm going for it. That's a guess, but I'm going for it. I think that's correct. Isn't this a
[6220.93s -> 6230.29s]  space for one down here somewhere that lets me continue. So therefore one, two, three, get rid
[6230.29s -> 6237.49s]  of that. One, two, three. That gives me the second two. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
[6237.49s -> 6251.18s]  One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Now what? Oh shit. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[6256.02s -> 6262.38s]  There it is. I knew these are going to be closed off. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two,
[6262.38s -> 6269.94s]  three. One, two. It is one, two, three, four. Okay. It could be either one of those. Relax.
[6269.94s -> 6290.58s]  Who's this guy talking? Oh, it's, of course it's a Drupal985. Three. This has to be the three.
[6293.01s -> 6306.54s]  Therefore that's the three. This is the three. One, two, three. Okay. Seven goes down all the way,
[6306.54s -> 6321.62s]  right? Cause that would be four to two. Wait, hold on. Is this the guy that found an ancient
[6321.62s -> 6335.66s]  treasure on stream? I did. This is part of the three. One, two, three. I can, I know I can deduce
[6335.66s -> 6341.46s]  this right now, but my brain just can't do it. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four,
[6341.46s -> 6353.49s]  five. My brain is so small. No, I have a huge brain. It's just, I don't know. I feel like I've
[6353.49s -> 6358.13s]  like sucked like an intelligence vacuum in the back of my head over the last like 10 years.
[6358.85s -> 6381.73s]  Three, four, five, six, seven. Where could this actually be though? I know I can do this. Let me,
[6381.73s -> 6398.67s]  all right. Quiet. Quiet, everybody. Quiet. If I do this one here, what would be,
[6398.67s -> 6404.77s]  this is the second two and that would be the three going this way. I think that's correct.
[6405.57s -> 6420.11s]  And then now I've got three. Seven is now five, six, seven. Five, six, seven. What's this? That's a one,
[6420.35s -> 6438.61s]  two, three, two, space, two, three. Okay. Hold on. Three there. Three, five, seven. One, two, three,
[6438.61s -> 6454.42s]  four, five, six, seven. One, no. I hope this is correct. Now could this be this way? I think
[6454.42s -> 6472.38s]  that's done. Right? Oh, I'm just going. I'm just going. I hope this is correct. Three, two, two,
[6473.26s -> 6489.65s]  one, four. I need four here. One, two, three, four. You guys think it's a gun? Okay. Hold on.
[6491.04s -> 6516.18s]  Second row. Three, two, five. Okay. Good. There's the three. Yes. It only took me
[6516.90s -> 6534.06s]  30 minutes to get here. Now this is one, three, one, two, three. Okay. Now I've got a mess over
[6534.06s -> 6549.63s]  here to deal with. Is it a shark? Yeah, this is a dolphin. It's some type of amphibious fish or
[6549.63s -> 6570.11s]  something. One, two, three, four, one, two. I think you Pat stares at for the raid. Pat stares at.
[6570.59s -> 6578.45s]  Welcome, everybody. We had a good stream, Pat. I'm Jerma. Currently doing. What are we doing? We're
[6578.45s -> 6586.62s]  doing Hick Ross with intense music behind it. Because that's what we do here. Super epic,
[6586.62s -> 6594.38s]  intense streams. X, X, X, X, X. Go with the fucking X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. All done. All
[6594.38s -> 6608.66s]  of them gone. All right. What are we doing? Done. This one's done. Two, three. Oh, it's almost done.
[6608.66s -> 6636.54s]  Our dolphin is almost done. Our dolphin. Oh, oh, that was wrong. What went wrong? What went
[6636.54s -> 6640.22s]  wrong? What did I do wrong? I was like, no, I wasn't paying attention. Two, one, two, two.
[6641.50s -> 6649.39s]  Oh, this is a no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stop. One space, one space. Why is
[6649.39s -> 6686.45s]  this three? What happened here? How did I, what did I do? What happened here? One, one, did I do
[6686.45s -> 6692.93s]  wrong here? You're almost there. I got, yeah. I almost, I just got to fix this somehow. Move
[6692.93s -> 6714.42s]  four. This looks out of place. Start over again. Oh my God. Get out of here. Two, one, three. This is
[6714.42s -> 6736.82s]  two, one, one, one, two. Oh, goodness. This is so almost done. Where is this? Move one from one, one,
[6737.70s -> 6755.87s]  two, one, three. It's like done. It's the eye. Yeah, that's the eye right there. But what is this
[6755.87s -> 6763.09s]  thing? That shouldn't be there. All right. Turn off the fucking, like, we're about to like fly into
[6763.09s -> 6768.66s]  outer space music. I need to concentrate. All I could see was be strapped to an astronaut chair.
[6768.66s -> 6773.14s]  Just like going up into the moon and stuff. Like get that off. I need to pay attention.
[6773.78s -> 6809.66s]  I think it's down here. Um, where's the mistake? Where I, where's the fucking mistake? What is it?
[6809.98s -> 6826.93s]  What is this stupid ass mistake? One, three. This is, this is all fucked up. Move vertical one,
[6826.93s -> 6836.54s]  three, down by one. Move vertical one, three, down by one. Wait, what? Vertical one, three.
[6837.10s -> 6848.30s]  What happened? Fill in the four. This is wrong. Oh my God. What is the fucking wrong here? What
[6848.30s -> 6872.88s]  is the problem? What did I do? Seven, one needs to be over one. Like over here. Oh no. No. Okay.
[6872.88s -> 6886.94s]  Hold on. One, go back more? No, I don't think so. Two, one, two is bad. Two, one, two, bad. Two,
[6886.94s -> 6918.53s]  one, two, bad. Who is back here? Here? Three, four, done, done. Seven, two, two, three.
[6927.42s -> 6935.86s]  One, two oatmeal. I don't know what that means. One, one, two. One, one, two. One, one, two.
[6936.75s -> 6949.92s]  But where is the mistake? Oh God damn it. One, does this need to be moved over? There's so many
[6949.92s -> 6958.27s]  X's and shit on the screen. I have no idea what's going on. The bottom of one, one, two is the
[6958.27s -> 6972.13s]  mistake. You have one, two, one, one, one, like here. And then, so where the hell does this two go?
[6977.74s -> 6987.82s]  One, one, two. And then one. Oh my God. I'm like literally like seeing colors right now. It's like
[6987.82s -> 6998.19s]  everything's just mixing together. Three is two. One, one, two is throwing. Help me. Just help me,
[6998.19s -> 7028.70s]  please. One, three down one block. Then where's the one go? This two is done. Two, one, two,
[7028.78s -> 7043.28s]  two, one, two, two, one. Oh my God. Somebody help me, please. Oh.
[7059.01s -> 7071.57s]  Oh, there's one. Fucking finally. Oh, get out of here. Come on. Okay. Whatever you say, win.
[7072.53s -> 7078.86s]  This is 15. So three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. This is interesting.
[7079.58s -> 7103.41s]  Three, two, two, three, four, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, eight. I can do this one. Let's just say,
[7103.41s -> 7107.34s]  for instance, this is occupied. It looks like one, one. So let's, I guess what I got to work
[7107.34s -> 7112.94s]  with. So we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[7112.94s -> 7123.65s]  seven, eight. Cool. So what does that do for us here? What does that do? I'm so, what the hell
[7123.65s -> 7127.82s]  was I doing? I don't know. I thought that was going to be funny or something. I don't know
[7127.82s -> 7131.82s]  what that was. I thought that was going to be funny. I was like, oh, I'll make like a noise.
[7131.82s -> 7138.38s]  That wasn't even, why would I do that? There's no reason to even do that. Oh, this is the song,
[7138.38s -> 7152.61s]  is the song. Oh, let me make like a loud slurp, snort thing. I don't know. That was not even funny
[7152.61s -> 7161.49s]  at all. Okay. One, five, six, seven, eight, nine spaces. I think I can do this one here.
[7163.78s -> 7180.18s]  Five and five. I don't know if this is the one or the two.
[7181.06s -> 7192.14s]  That did not help me at all. One, two horizontal can make a lot of X on the right.
[7196.05s -> 7200.18s]  Well, here's the problem though. I don't know if this is the one or the two,
[7200.18s -> 7212.70s]  because if this is the one, the two could be anywhere over here. I feel like I can
[7212.70s -> 7226.54s]  get this one somehow. Let's see. One, two, three, one, two, two, three. I mean, it's got a
[7227.34s -> 7235.39s]  Five lets you place one on each side, doesn't it? It's very loud. Let me turn that down a little.
[7237.57s -> 7251.41s]  The fives can do one on each side. I guess this could be one here and then one here.
[7252.29s -> 7264.22s]  Is that possible? One here and one here, right? I think that makes sense. Oh, shit. Nice. Okay.
[7264.22s -> 7268.62s]  Hold on. One, two, one, two. Take a look at this. If that's accurate, which it should be.
[7269.50s -> 7278.18s]  Now this helps here. Not really, but kind of. This doesn't even help at all, actually.
[7278.98s -> 7288.93s]  I don't know if this is the three or the one. It's probably the one.
[7295.09s -> 7300.27s]  Louder? All right. It's a little louder. Relax. Three, two, two is easier now.
[7301.60s -> 7310.13s]  It is. You're right. One, two, three, space, one, two, space, one, two, three. Oh, it doesn't.
[7315.33s -> 7318.74s]  That means it would be, hold on. Oh, this is blocked off.
[7318.74s -> 7326.02s]  We'll do like this then. One, two, three, space, one, two, two, one, two, three. Shit.
[7327.38s -> 7334.14s]  It's not, I can't do it yet though. It could be, this whole thing could be moved over one spot.
[7334.94s -> 7349.97s]  You can play some. I guess I could. Which ones are guaranteed? I would probably say that this
[7349.97s -> 7357.66s]  one's guaranteed. That's the only one that I think is guaranteed, right? I got 500k? Did I?
[7359.58s -> 7367.68s]  Four, nine, nine, 98. No, we're not there. Four. Oh, no, we did. That's 500,000. Holy shit. Cool.
[7367.68s -> 7381.23s]  500,000 followers on Twitch. Wow. Thanks, guys. It's been a lot of fun. Cool. 500k.
[7383.07s -> 7400.86s]  Speech. Rub-a-dub-dub. Thanks for the grub. Part. Why, you little. So this one is accurate, right?
[7401.42s -> 7409.14s]  Because if it's one, two, three, one, two, three, these two can be placed. These, I don't,
[7409.14s -> 7414.74s]  I can't do these ones though. Fuck, I'm unfollowing. What are you talking about?
[7414.74s -> 7432.35s]  So that helps. That helps a lot. Well, that helps a lot. All right. So this changes everything here
[7432.35s -> 7436.77s]  because I might be able to actually do this now. One, two, three, four, five,
[7436.77s -> 7447.25s]  space, one, two, three, four, five. Most of these can be filled in. At least a lot of them can.
[7447.25s -> 7457.23s]  Which then one, two, three, by this whole row. Wait. Wait, what happened? Hold on. Why did I
[7457.23s -> 7464.43s]  just do that? One, two, one, two, three. Okay. Oh, wait. I'm freaking out. 500k song? Omega Low
[7464.43s -> 7479.70s]  under 500k. Well, it's not these ones. Not these ones. Is that incorrect? Wrong. Wrong. This is
[7479.70s -> 7489.60s]  wrong, right? This is one, two, three. I can block that off. This is probably the three.
[7489.60s -> 7502.98s]  That's probably the three. One, two, block this off. All right. Five, five is wrong. One, two,
[7502.98s -> 7512.24s]  one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five.
[7517.50s -> 7541.17s]  It was right. No, I think one, two, one, two. No, that's right. Oh my God. This is a Nancy
[7541.17s -> 7552.43s]  Drew game. Yup. That's not right. Are you sure? I think that's correct. Because then that gets
[7552.43s -> 7558.56s]  rid of that. That is right. Yeah, that's correct. So then it's not, I have to just worry about the
[7558.56s -> 7565.30s]  eight here. Three. Can't be that way. So one, two, three. It's close. I can't do it yet, though.
[7567.18s -> 7582.43s]  Oh, fuck. What do I do? Three, three. No two here yet. Four, four, three. You filthy animal. Oh my
[7582.43s -> 7590.67s]  God. It could be one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three.
[7599.60s -> 7602.24s]  I can't do it. Three, two, row. I can have stuff blocked.
[7604.59s -> 7620.77s]  You messing with me? Are you messing with me? All right. So this would be the three. One, two, three.
[7621.57s -> 7632.02s]  Three. Can't beat any of these. It has to be here. You messing with me? That's done. What about here
[7632.02s -> 7643.30s]  now? So this is definitely the two and the two somehow. Oh, fuck. This is wrong. So it was wrong.
[7643.30s -> 7669.58s]  The five was right. Three, two is the bad one. This one here. Three, two wrong, not five. Oh,
[7669.58s -> 7677.87s]  this one's wrong. What else does this logically go? The X's you put on three, two are wrong.
[7682.88s -> 7702.83s]  This was, if this is two, then this can't exist here. Remove the two. Shit. So if this is, this
[7703.15s -> 7711.60s]  nothing over here can be used. This is correct, right? If this is correct, then I can't do
[7711.60s -> 7725.12s]  anything up there. And with this one. And this one. And this one. Okay. So how, what the hell?
[7726.32s -> 7732.77s]  It has to be, is this the two then? This must be the two. Maybe not. It could be one, two, three.
[7732.77s -> 7746.93s]  This could be three, two. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. What does that do for me over here? It's mate. Four,
[7746.93s -> 7756.56s]  four, three. I can't do the four, four, three yet. Let's see. One, one, two, three, four. One,
[7756.56s -> 7766.16s]  two, three. Let's see what it looks like. Can't do that yet. Oh my God. Relax. Bird row from the
[7766.16s -> 7773.98s]  bottom. Fifth from the left. I can't, I like, you just gave me directions. Wait, wait, wait,
[7773.98s -> 7781.98s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. This is three, five. I mean this one, two, three space. All right.
[7781.98s -> 7792.22s]  The three has to be here. There's your two. There's that. There's three. Cap that. There's the one.
[7794.22s -> 7803.74s]  One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. There's three. Close that off. That's the one.
[7803.74s -> 7810.38s]  This is the two. So one, two, nothing over here. One, two could be over that way. There's the two.
[7810.38s -> 7815.26s]  The first one, of course, there's the four. This row's done. This gives you the three,
[7815.26s -> 7827.58s]  which completes the two. Complete that three. What do we have here? That's the one. What about
[7827.58s -> 7832.94s]  here? One, five. There's a two over here. Which has to be one of these. That's your three. Lock
[7832.94s -> 7847.70s]  that off. Okay. This has to be four. That's done. There's two. Two, two, three. Ooh, this is getting
[7847.70s -> 7857.62s]  exciting. Three. Lock it off. It killed this whole thing. Four, four, three. Oh, that was so
[7857.62s -> 7868.53s]  satisfying. I love that. Three. We need two and then two somewhere over here. Here's the real
[7868.53s -> 7874.40s]  question though. This can't be three. This has to be the three. One, two, three. Oh, I don't know
[7874.40s -> 7886.54s]  that yet. Hold on. Okay. Good. Can any of these be brought from the bottom? This is the one.
[7887.50s -> 7896.94s]  Yep, it is. Also a one. Here's the eight. Cool. Can't be a two here.
[7902.78s -> 7905.98s]  I'm not doing that. People are gonna actually like think that's fucking annoying. Like, I would.
[7907.58s -> 7910.54s]  If it were me in the chat room right now, I would be like, that's annoying. And like,
[7910.54s -> 7918.78s]  just stop doing it. It's not funny. That would like annoy me. That would be actually annoying.
[7919.42s -> 7930.67s]  There's one. There's also a one. All right, now it's all coming together. Can't be here. One, two,
[7930.67s -> 7938.43s]  three, four, five. There's the three. When it all starts coming together, I love it. It looks so
[7938.43s -> 7950.99s]  wonderful. There's your two. Wait. Don't get too crazy about this. That's one, one, two. This is
[7950.99s -> 7965.97s]  the last two. What even is this thing? I have no idea what this is. What is this? What is it?
[7966.69s -> 7976.11s]  Flame? Oh, it's a campfire. Nice. It's peanut butter jelly time. That actually did kind of look
[7976.11s -> 7981.14s]  like that. Nice. Okay, is there any more that I didn't do back here? I did them all back here,
[7981.14s -> 7993.04s]  right? Nice. Look at how many I did. Well, here we go. There's still more to do. I kind of want to
[7993.04s -> 8000.42s]  do a huge one. Where's the first 20? Okay, this is 20 by 20. This is gonna be a mess, by the way.
[8000.42s -> 8010.54s]  Good luck. This actually is good. It's 16. One, two, three, four. Technically, one, two, three,
[8010.54s -> 8017.55s]  four, right? Does it need to have four on either side? All right. Oh, it happened. It actually
[8017.55s -> 8025.39s]  happened. This is the equivalent of getting in breakout the ball stuck on top in the first or
[8025.39s -> 8049.17s]  second shot of the game. You'll see what I mean in a second. Nice. Okay. Oh, 15, 16, 17. Oh, wow.
[8049.73s -> 8057.41s]  Okay. So, this is connected here because it's one by 15. That's one, two, three, four, five, six,
[8057.41s -> 8063.65s]  seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Space one. Well, could this be
[8063.65s -> 8071.09s]  the one? And we go wham. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
[8071.09s -> 8078.37s]  Nope. Has to be connected. This is done already. Holy shit. Cool. Anything else already done? This
[8078.37s -> 8086.58s]  is done. This looks like some kind of, is it like a box? Four. Can't be in the middle there.
[8088.62s -> 8097.60s]  It's a snail. Yeah, it's probably going to be a snail. Okay. Seven. I think it's in the middle.
[8097.60s -> 8112.30s]  Is it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay. Two or two. Don't know yet. It is a snail.
[8112.30s -> 8121.84s]  Yeah. Is it going to be a snail? One, two, two, one. All right. A cat? Will it be like a cathead?
[8122.24s -> 8131.82s]  No, it's not a cat. Four, two. Don't have the info for that. Two could be in there. One, fifteen.
[8134.85s -> 8141.97s]  A lot of shit over here. Let's see. One of these is four. One of these is two. That's the first two.
[8141.97s -> 8151.38s]  Or the second two. That could be the second two. Nope. One, four. One, two, one, two, three, four.
[8152.02s -> 8158.78s]  One, two, three, four. One, two. Wait, I don't have that info, do I? Yeah, I do. One, two, three, four.
[8159.74s -> 8175.95s]  Nine, one. Oh, shit. Cool. All right. And it's four. Nice. Yeah, it's definitely a snail.
[8176.51s -> 8184.22s]  All right. So that means two, one, one. Close that off. There's your two. There's your one.
[8184.22s -> 8199.57s]  The whole thing is gone. Maybe it's a dog. Four. Anything else? One, two, two, two, two, two, two,
[8199.57s -> 8213.90s]  one. What about this one? One, two, two, one, two. Dinosaur? I think you guys got it right. I think
[8213.90s -> 8226.45s]  it is a snail. Four, three, four. One, two, three, four. Okay, so that's two. Block that off. That's
[8226.45s -> 8238.94s]  one. Block it off. Block it off. And fifteen. Take a look at that. Done. Nice. Four. Got it. Two. Close
[8238.94s -> 8252.46s]  it. Two. Close it. Sixteen can, I think, be completed here. Almost. One, two, one. It's a one-up.
[8253.02s -> 8271.07s]  It is a one-up. Oh, shit. Okay. Yeah. Is this like Mario? Wait, this is wrong. One, one, two, three,
[8271.07s -> 8280.99s]  four, five. One, two. How's that wrong? It's a number DMCA. How did I get DMCA'd over this?
[8281.47s -> 8289.04s]  That's right, right? No, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't be an idiot.
[8289.92s -> 8311.28s]  It's done. Two, two, two. One, one. Done. One, two. Shit. One, two, one. Oh, there it is. Nice.
[8312.00s -> 8339.06s]  One-up. Extra life. It really did look like a snail, though. This one is very weird. Okay.
[8341.97s -> 8347.90s]  Uh, I guess let's just start putting it out. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[8351.02s -> 8365.28s]  Seven. One, one, four. One, one, one, one, one. Okay. Ten, seventeen, eighteen. But hold on.
[8366.08s -> 8388.88s]  Let me just do this first. One step at a time. Seven. Okay. All right. Four. There's another
[8388.96s -> 8395.55s]  four in here. Number nineteen is the whole way down. Oh, shit. Okay. Yeah, you're right. It is.
[8399.20s -> 8408.83s]  The bottom is blocked off. You're right. Okay. Oh, my God. I have to do the top now. All right.
[8408.83s -> 8427.50s]  I'm getting overwhelmed if I don't stop. What else do I have that's guaranteed? Somewhere in here.
[8427.50s -> 8448.98s]  One, two, three. These are all ones, so just block it off. Bottom one. Ten, seven. Yep. One,
[8448.98s -> 8455.36s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Now we do the
[8455.36s -> 8466.02s]  bottom. All right. This is done. All the way up. This one is done there. One, one, one, one.
[8466.66s -> 8479.79s]  No, that's four. Four. All row. Nice. Oh, God. This is the most boring game to watch,
[8479.79s -> 8501.14s]  Jerma, please. Go watch one of the other 700 million streams. Just change the look.
[8501.54s -> 8514.99s]  An infomercial is on right now on this channel. Just like, you can flip around. Is this a QR code?
[8514.99s -> 8535.73s]  I don't know. Yo, it's a QR code. No, this is fun. I'm having fun. Can I go this way?
[8537.66s -> 8541.98s]  Picross is like one of my favorite video games ever made. It's right next to Diablo II.
[8541.98s -> 8546.10s]  If this shit was on that 100 best games of all time list, it would have been numbered three.
[8551.81s -> 8558.19s]  One, one, maybe 10. All right. Wait, wait, wait. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[8558.19s -> 8569.22s]  eight, nine, 10. One, two, three, four, five. It's all in here. He loves Picross,
[8569.22s -> 8582.67s]  but he hates Tetris. Yeah, because Tetris is stupid. Fuck you.
[8593.50s -> 8603.62s]  I don't like Tetris. Is that illegal to say? I don't like Tetris. I don't like Tetris.
[8603.70s -> 8613.12s]  It's gonna be the four. Nope. Yeah, it could be. That is illegal. All right. Hold on. Almost done.
[8613.68s -> 8622.85s]  Three, four. So it can't be this one. All right. There's so many ones and fours. I'm gonna lose
[8622.85s -> 8634.45s]  track here. One, one. Next thing is two fours in a row. Is this a maze? I don't know. Well,
[8634.45s -> 8642.11s]  there's another one here, another one here, and then a seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[8642.83s -> 8660.06s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Right? The seven has to be in the middle here. Good. I do
[8660.06s -> 8667.66s]  not like Tetris. Tetris is fun to watch somebody that knows what they're doing, but not for me to
[8667.66s -> 8678.40s]  play it. He said he loved Tetris in an Overwatch stream like four years ago. I'm making it up. I
[8678.40s -> 8685.90s]  don't know. Show me the clip. You show me the clip of me talking about how much I love Tetris.
[8685.90s -> 8702.96s]  You tell me. I want to see it. One, four, one. There's another one here. Find it. Find it.
[8702.96s -> 8714.56s]  I need the fours here. This is one, four, four, one, seven, one, four. Let's just say it's here.
[8715.20s -> 8728.14s]  That means it would be one, two, three, four. I can deduce that. Do I read chat? I've been reading.
[8728.14s -> 8732.72s]  How would I come up with all the things you guys are saying? How would I come up with all the things
[8732.72s -> 8750.48s]  you guys are saying? Okay. That hit a seven writer. Nope. That's a one, seven, one. Shit.
[8750.48s -> 8770.86s]  False comments. I Tetris. No, I get too frustrated when I play Tetris. I can't do it.
[8771.42s -> 8781.70s]  I get omega frustrated. Okay. One, seven. It's going to get harder. I guess I'll get harder.
[8788.85s -> 8795.94s]  Then two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There's another one here. So let's
[8795.94s -> 8803.42s]  just say it's here. That means let's just say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[8803.42s -> 8816.86s]  nine, ten. Does that do anything for me? It does. That actually does a lot. I hope it's right. Okay.
[8818.34s -> 8822.98s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. How are you guys doing? I didn't ask
[8822.98s -> 8830.82s]  that. Did I? Did I ask that? Did I ask how you guys are doing today? I should have. How are you?
[8830.82s -> 8843.97s]  Hard things. You got a test tomorrow? Shit. It's all right. You have to do fine. Remember, don't
[8843.97s -> 8849.14s]  worry. But if you get, as long as you get like a C plus to a B minus is fine. Don't let anybody
[8849.14s -> 8862.38s]  tell you differently. I've got seven here. There's one here. Get this one. I'm going to have to start
[8862.38s -> 8873.73s]  here. So let's see. Two, three, four, five, six. Now it's still the same. Okay. Xbox. Turn off.
[8873.73s -> 8885.87s]  Going kind of sad because I don't like school. Neither did I. Neither did I. I actually really
[8885.87s -> 8892.83s]  didn't like school. I thought it was like boring and annoying and it pissed me off. But I did it.
[8892.83s -> 8905.62s]  I got through it. I was doing enough. I think we put too much pressure on like kids to do really
[8905.62s -> 8912.51s]  well in school. We teach them stuff they have to memorize and then we base how smart they are based
[8912.51s -> 8921.23s]  on how much they remembered. Which I think that's not the correct way to do things. But you know,
[8924.56s -> 8937.52s]  I'm looking for the one that's over here. This is almost done. Here we go. One, one, four. This is
[8937.52s -> 8948.32s]  the four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. I think that's correct. This has to be the
[8948.32s -> 8955.49s]  seven. Oh God. This is a guess, but it's I'm taking an educated guess here. This is a guess,
[8955.49s -> 8983.39s]  but whatever. Guessing Gary. I think that's right. But people learn so differently. I honestly,
[8983.39s -> 8988.75s]  I think our entire education system has been still doing the same things that they did back
[8988.75s -> 8995.09s]  in like the forties. Like there's so much shit that we need to know that we need to learn that
[8995.09s -> 9002.10s]  are important. Like why are we still treating school like it's a 19, like fucking 20? I don't
[9002.10s -> 9006.64s]  understand. I don't know why. We literally have cars that are going to fucking start driving on
[9006.64s -> 9010.40s]  their own. We're still using the same like educational system from like the fucking thirties.
[9010.40s -> 9024.58s]  Why? I don't know. Oh, I was, I thought you guys, okay. I thought you guys were saying 7-Eleven.
[9025.54s -> 9028.98s]  Like 7-Eleven, like go to 7-Eleven. I thought it was like a weird stream joke thing you guys
[9028.98s -> 9037.50s]  are doing. Seven, seven. Okay. Hold on. Oh, right here. Like go to 7-Eleven, 7-Eleven,
[9037.50s -> 9050.83s]  get like a Slurpee. I don't know. I thought you guys are making a weird joke. Oh wow. That
[9050.83s -> 9068.37s]  changed everything. Oh shit. Okay. This one was done. Hungry, hungry hippos. Actually not a bad
[9068.37s -> 9080.91s]  idea. One, one. It's done. What the hell are we looking at here? You know what I mean? Like,
[9080.91s -> 9096.53s]  what is this? Four? Four? Some kind of maze? Hold on. Go back. I think, I think I just didn't
[9096.53s -> 9115.90s]  want to do that. Hold on. Four. What is this? Labyrinth. That's kind of dull. Labyrinth.
[9123.71s -> 9139.44s]  Oh, this one looks cool. This is 20 by 20. Oh no. It's an FTK maze. This is the whole thing.
[9140.08s -> 9148.58s]  Any of the big ones? Seven would be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Two, three, four,
[9148.58s -> 9152.82s]  five, six, seven. I mean, I know I can't deduce that, but I don't care. I'm keeping it there.
[9153.95s -> 9186.77s]  N-eleven, 12, 13, 14. Uh, new ISD. But, um, Hearthstone. No, no, no. Hearthstone. Fine. How
[9186.77s -> 9195.30s]  about The Sims 1? I think that's pretty good. I'll be playing this when I get back. I'm gonna do a
[9195.30s -> 9205.23s]  Sims 1 stream. Multiple streams probably. Okay. Well, very obviously this is connected together.
[9205.87s -> 9216.83s]  There's no way it's not. Eight, nine, ten, eleven. That would be, let's just say one, two, three,
[9216.83s -> 9223.23s]  four, five, six, seven, eight. Space one, two. Or we could do one, two, space. So that would be
[9224.03s -> 9231.02s]  right there. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[9231.10s -> 9239.74s]  seven, eight. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. All right. That looks pretty good to me.
[9241.60s -> 9251.74s]  Fourteen would be how much on each side? It'd be like this, right? Six, one, two, three, four, five,
[9251.74s -> 9263.92s]  six. Yay. Yay. Gabby J. Yay. Yay. I have, I have an actual curiosity for you guys.
[9265.07s -> 9274.18s]  How many times over the last five years on Twitch have I done the super punch out Gabby J. guy?
[9274.18s -> 9279.65s]  It's probably like five to ten times. I've done it a lot. It's been at least three to five times.
[9279.65s -> 9285.63s]  At least probably ten. I don't know why it just pops in and just does it. Okay. Seven. There it is.
[9286.19s -> 9292.80s]  I didn't do it yesterday. I wasn't streaming yesterday. What are you talking about?
[9294.34s -> 9309.95s]  He did it yesterday. Three, four, five, six. Two, three, four. He did it yesterday. Six, seven.
[9312.51s -> 9331.22s]  All right. Getting there. Revoice Andy. Ow. How did you just hurt me? Well, this is interesting.
[9331.22s -> 9336.74s]  Is this the two or the seven? Probably the two. Wait. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[9336.74s -> 9349.38s]  Can't be down here. That's the seven. But then none of these can be correct. Cool. That shaves that
[9349.38s -> 9356.48s]  down. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, space, one, two. All right. So let's just say
[9356.48s -> 9362.74s]  there's one, two. I'm just saying. That doesn't mean it's, I just scratched your, I scratched you
[9362.74s -> 9384.11s]  in the eye. Could it be there? Interesting. Interesting. One, two, three. This whole row
[9384.11s -> 9396.86s]  is done for this one. It's probably the two in here. One, two, three. Oh, this is wrong.
[9396.86s -> 9418.59s]  This is ugly. What happened here? I think it has solved this, which means this is three and this
[9418.59s -> 9435.01s]  is three. One, two, three. Killed out. One, two, three. Killed out. I'd like to solve six, six.
[9435.01s -> 9440.85s]  Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. Get out of here. Get out of here. I like this one. It's
[9440.85s -> 9451.78s]  cool. I like this one. This one's nice. I'd like to spin, please. Oh, right. That's from the
[9451.78s -> 9464.05s]  Little Fortune game. Is it a goose? I don't know. Well, one is this again. This is completely toast
[9464.05s -> 9482.18s]  down here. Nice. Very nice. Very nice. Wait, don't assume. And one, this all goes away. One, two,
[9482.18s -> 9491.71s]  three, four. Block those. Can't be there. Can't be there. How does he read messages the moment
[9491.71s -> 9509.62s]  they come out? The Five Nights at Freddy's guy. I don't know if this is the four or the three.
[9509.62s -> 9516.69s]  It's probably the, it's the four. Okay. So that means this whole thing is done, which means this
[9516.69s -> 9527.87s]  is done too. And so is this. Is it a flamingo? It's probably a flamingo. I think it's a flamingo.
[9535.30s -> 9547.39s]  Three. Okay. Right there. And this is a three. One, two, three, eight. Two and eight. One, two,
[9547.39s -> 9557.57s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight. This is going to be one. Hello, everyone. How's the stream been?
[9557.57s -> 9565.31s]  It's been really comfy and just cozy and hanging out. By the way, reiteration, Andy, because I don't
[9565.31s -> 9572.08s]  know how many people have come and gone. We'll just give the quick TLDR again. TLDR. I just
[9572.08s -> 9578.64s]  pressed F4. Hopefully it didn't do anything weird. Okay. So I am not going to be streaming
[9578.64s -> 9583.36s]  for three weeks. I'll be back on April 1st. There's a ton of projects, huge announcements to make,
[9584.00s -> 9587.52s]  some very exciting stuff. A lot of you guys probably going to really, really be into.
[9587.52s -> 9594.64s]  So keep on the lookout there. TLDR. I need to get my medical shit solved and treated. I need to get
[9594.64s -> 9599.52s]  a treatment and a procedure for it because it's like six huge fucking projects that if I don't
[9599.52s -> 9605.62s]  get it solved, then it's going to be horrible to deal with. So I have to get on top of this
[9605.62s -> 9612.24s]  before we do any of these major, major projects among some other personal things. So there you
[9612.24s -> 9618.70s]  are. Got to get on top of this because I can't let it just sit around. I can't keep just like,
[9618.70s -> 9624.22s]  well, I don't, I did all this stuff six, seven months ago, eight, like a year ago. And I,
[9624.22s -> 9628.62s]  there's nothing really, there's nothing really horribly wrong with me, but there's something
[9628.62s -> 9634.32s]  wrong with me that needs to be treated. Oh, there you go. I have to get on it because it's starting
[9634.32s -> 9652.61s]  to cause problems again. There we go. That's the one, daisy three, one, two, three. All right.
[9652.61s -> 9666.56s]  That's done. What about here? One, two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I can't do it yet.
[9667.20s -> 9680.80s]  I remember this song. This is the four. I don't know. All right. Hold on. Close my one eye.
[9681.52s -> 9691.30s]  Oh, what the hell am I doing? Yeah. All this is nothing. All this is nothing too.
[9691.94s -> 9711.33s]  Okay. Does that help me or three? Okay. Well that's done. Uh, one, two, three, somewhere over there.
[9711.33s -> 9736.22s]  12, one, two oatmeal. I think that's right. One, three, four. It's gotta be a three in here.
[9736.86s -> 9751.07s]  Wait this way. Two, one, two. Oh shit. That's it. That's two, one, two, one. And now that therefore
[9751.07s -> 9768.67s]  this has to be connected here to, it's a flamingo. One, three, four. There's nothing here.
[9770.06s -> 9780.08s]  One, three. Definitely not here. Okay. One, two, three, one, two, three. Third row here. Okay. Good.
[9783.20s -> 9790.58s]  And then here's number four, two, two, two. Why does it have a weird like
[9791.54s -> 9804.30s]  puzzler? What's it called? Four, three, four. Is that the three or the four? I don't know.
[9809.81s -> 9826.06s]  Five, three, five, three. Here. Is it a swan or a stand? It could be like a staff. I don't know.
[9826.06s -> 9843.42s]  Could be something weird. One, three, four. Crane. Yeah. Two, two, 14 going down. Oh shit. Hold on.
[9843.42s -> 9869.20s]  One, two. Well, 13, 14. I think I can deduce that. Yeah, that can be deduced. Four, three, four.
[9872.03s -> 9887.18s]  The leg's kind of bent. Did I do it right? I think that's good. That looks a little weird.
[9887.18s -> 9913.74s]  I think that's correct. Done. Done. Three. This is toast. This is toast. Toast. Two. Three. Three.
[9914.70s -> 9928.43s]  What are we missing here? All right. What is it? A turkey? That's an ostrich. Very cool. All right.
[9928.43s -> 9938.27s]  I'm going to do something else real quick. I want to go to the workshop. I'm very curious about
[9938.27s -> 9941.63s]  something. See, this is what I did. So these are all from the workshop and they're hidden.
[9945.79s -> 9959.04s]  What are these? Because they're hidden. I'm kind of afraid. So this is 78. This is 30 by 30.
[9962.38s -> 9981.58s]  I'm going to play it, I guess. Oh my God. This is so much. 30 by 30. So if it's 20, it means
[9981.58s -> 9990.77s]  it kept one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Two, three, four, five, six,
[9990.77s -> 9997.81s]  seven, eight, nine, 10. These are guaranteed. 23, 24. Oh, hold on. One, two, three, four, five,
[9998.77s -> 10010.64s]  six, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three,
[10012.13s -> 10017.65s]  okay. 26, 27. Don't torture yourself with this. But what does this have to do with
[10017.65s -> 10028.10s]  Jerma? This is the final boss. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. I can get a lot of these right here.
[10029.06s -> 10038.24s]  22. Hold on. Let's see. One, two, space. One, two, space. 22 now. One, two, three, four, five,
[10038.24s -> 10051.38s]  six, seven, eight, two. Okay. So we go like this. It has to be there. Somewhere in there.
[10051.94s -> 10067.28s]  Now check this out. We get a lot of info here. Oh, come on. Give me more data. Give me some more
[10067.28s -> 10080.78s]  data. 20. Is that 20? I don't know. One, two, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 15, 16, 17,
[10080.78s -> 10106.62s]  18, 19, 20. Cool. 15 now. So down to here. 15, 14, 13, 11. Okay. And that's all the data that
[10106.62s -> 10124.86s]  I have right now. It's going to be the J. We'll find out. All right. 22 now. So we can go,
[10124.86s -> 10131.50s]  let's count. So 22 minus eight on either side. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[10132.88s -> 10144.16s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There we go. I'm very curious of what this actually
[10144.16s -> 10156.59s]  is. 21. Holy shit. What are the arrows on the top left for? I think to zoom in. 21. Okay. This is
[10156.59s -> 10167.31s]  all the way across. 21 though. Is that, let's see, five, 10, 15, one, five, 10, 15, 20, 21,
[10168.64s -> 10182.99s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven. I mean, that's, I can do that. Six, five, again, five again,
[10182.99s -> 10197.58s]  four. Cool. Seven, seven, eight. What the hell is it? What is this? Is it just nothing? No,
[10197.58s -> 10209.68s]  it has to be something. It's not just nothing. Well, here's the five and then this is the six
[10209.68s -> 10225.65s]  on two, three, four, five, six, nine. All right. What else can I do up top? Let's add these together.
[10225.65s -> 10235.81s]  Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. That would be 21 across. It's 16. So let's go like this.
[10237.42s -> 10247.86s]  Two space. Now we, so now that's 27. So if it's, wait, yeah, 27. We need 16. So 27
[10249.89s -> 10268.78s]  was, what am I doing? Right. Six, seven, eight, 14, 15, 16. So how many, it's 10,
[10268.78s -> 10288.24s]  11 spaces on either side. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 17. It's one, two, three, four, five, six,
[10288.24s -> 10296.75s]  seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[10298.21s -> 10319.84s]  This is a pain in the ass. Five, 10, 15, 16, 10, nine, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Okay.
[10320.64s -> 10335.50s]  One that's 22, right? 22. That'd be 20. So one space would be 28. So we need to count,
[10336.80s -> 10346.90s]  um, we need to count 28 minus, we need to count six spaces on each side. One, two, three, four,
[10346.90s -> 10359.41s]  five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. That do anything for me? Well, this is
[10359.41s -> 10368.37s]  definitely part of his 13. One, two, three, that'd be four. That's, I have six, 13 here. Is that 13
[10368.37s -> 10385.95s]  the whole way across? Okay. 21, seven. I can't do that here. Uh, this one could be done. That's,
[10385.95s -> 10400.77s]  that's 21, 22, 23. Not yet. Three, 21, 22. Yeah, we can connect this, which would be one. That's
[10401.74s -> 10428.13s]  five. God damn it. Little green lines. I'm 21, 22. Jesus. I'm almost done with that. Okay.
[10428.13s -> 10446.91s]  It's a terraria screenshot. I don't know what it is. 22 across. Why are these here? Why are these
[10446.91s -> 10455.81s]  here? Why do they put these here? These, these don't belong here, right? No, they don't.
[10455.81s -> 10465.42s]  Across to your past self. Well, 19. Let's connect 18. Maybe not. Um, this is eight.
[10466.14s -> 10482.90s]  Now it's actually just eight across, which makes this six. It's going to be among us. I don't have
[10482.90s -> 10489.49s]  any, I don't think that's what this is. Any of the huge numbers I didn't do yet? 23.
[10498.14s -> 10508.78s]  These sell candles that smell like you. Oh my God. You psycho. Four, five, six. One, two, three,
[10508.78s -> 10528.34s]  four, five, six. Oh, 21. What was it? 21, three, 21, one, three. Where's that at? 21, one, three.
[10529.06s -> 10543.30s]  What side is it on? Oh, 21, three. Okay. Oh, nice. We got even more data. Oh, I love when we unlock
[10543.30s -> 10557.09s]  data. Good. This is three, 15. That's done. And that's done. The whole thing's done. Okay. Cool.
[10561.52s -> 10574.70s]  What is the, okay, come on. 26. I feel like I can do this one. 26, one. That's 26, 27, and 28.
[10574.70s -> 10582.22s]  Let's go down here with space. So that would be, I need to count backwards if we're at 28.
[10582.94s -> 10590.93s]  So two, so one, two, and then the rest of these can be filled in. One, two, fill in the rest. Okay.
[10590.93s -> 10600.96s]  Get rid of these. I invested my life savings in bald coin currently filing for bankruptcy.
[10610.37s -> 10616.13s]  Seven, and then this is nine, nine. Is this nine right here? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[10616.13s -> 10625.28s]  eight, nine. Perfect. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. How many are here? 10, 11,
[10625.28s -> 10632.80s]  12. Some three on both sides. One, two, three. Fill those in. Cool. It's going to be 100% your
[10632.80s -> 10646.29s]  dumpy. Well, so this is six and 12. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four,
[10646.29s -> 10653.23s]  five, six. It's definitely this one at least. 100%. Remember, it's just going to get high
[10653.23s -> 10665.68s]  and drink Heal for three weeks. Medical leaf my ass. Well, this is connected. Is there anything
[10665.68s -> 10682.35s]  I can do up here? All right. 20 and three. That's definitely connected. Six, eight, two.
[10684.54s -> 10691.97s]  I can't believe you just read anything someone says. Why not? It's not like that big of a deal.
[10692.53s -> 10699.90s]  It's, they're just, all right. This, what about this 16? Let's get this one. There you go. There's
[10699.90s -> 10710.05s]  your one. So if it's 16, there's 30 spaces. That means 30, 29, 28, 27. So count 11 spaces. One,
[10710.05s -> 10732.02s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. These can be filled in. Mario. Watch it
[10732.02s -> 10753.06s]  just be a Mario like shitting thing. Like the ASCII art. Is he getting paid to play this?
[10753.94s -> 10761.41s]  Yes. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I am getting paid on this stream.
[10762.21s -> 10779.95s]  Not by the company that made this, but by some of you. Some of you have paid me today. Saved.
[10781.95s -> 10790.78s]  287. That'd be eight, seven. This is how many? What is here? 15. Wait, wait, wait. This is probably
[10790.78s -> 10799.38s]  15. Closed up. That's part of the 15. This is definitely part of the 14. Wait, it might not be.
[10799.38s -> 10819.23s]  I don't know that yet. That's a guess. All right. One, two, space. Is this all I could do here?
[10819.23s -> 10849.07s]  Yeah, I already did that. That would be one, two, three, four, five, six. What about these rows here?
[10849.15s -> 10859.46s]  This is nine. Nine, nine, four, five, 11, five, two, three, four, five.
[10860.50s -> 10887.14s]  I connected there. What the hell even is this? Six, 14. I feel like I'm missing a bunch down here.
[10890.88s -> 10897.52s]  18. Let's do this one. 18 and one. Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[10897.52s -> 10907.71s]  nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. It has to be there. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[10909.23s -> 10917.01s]  seven. That has to be blocked. Also seven. That's already blocked. Also six. One, two, three,
[10917.01s -> 10925.07s]  four, five, six. Okay, that's fine. This is also six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two,
[10925.07s -> 10941.78s]  three, four, five, six, five, five, nine, ten. Pot of coffee? Okay, hold on. This one here seems
[10941.78s -> 10962.74s]  like it could be done. 12, seven in a row. Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, three, seven. Damn it.
[10962.74s -> 10982.67s]  You need to start pretending. I don't think so. I'm overwhelming myself. This 17 right here.
[10982.67s -> 10990.99s]  Look at 17. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
[10994.40s -> 11005.78s]  Shit. One, two, four, six, seven, eight, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. I think that's it. I think so.
[11006.66s -> 11019.90s]  Then it's like two. Yeah, that's right. Eight, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three.
[11020.86s -> 11036.24s]  Okay. All right, getting there. You can't assume the bottom two. I can assume. Yes, I can. Six,
[11037.06s -> 11045.39s]  12. This is broken up here. Let's just assume that this is one, two, three, four, five, six,
[11045.39s -> 11058.29s]  right? Right? Let's assume that. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[11059.17s -> 11067.47s]  No, don't assume that. Let's just, we have to assume it. Forum two is in here. Wait a minute.
[11067.47s -> 11078.78s]  One, two, three, four, space two. I think this is going to be one, two, three, four, or one, two,
[11078.78s -> 11090.75s]  three, four, space two. This is so much better than bi-mode one. This is a great song.
[11091.71s -> 11105.33s]  Did we do this? Is this done? One, let's see. Five, 10, 15, 20, 22. No, it's 21. It can either
[11105.33s -> 11115.46s]  go up or down. I don't know why this is freaking me out so much. I think this is connected.
[11116.42s -> 11135.18s]  Okay, this has to be connected. This is part of the 14. 12, 6. This is part of the 12. All right,
[11135.18s -> 11142.16s]  what about up top here? 12, 10, 2. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Here we go. Is this 12 right here?
[11142.16s -> 11152.16s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Nice. This is part of the 10. Three, four, five,
[11152.16s -> 11161.36s]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10. All right, I can't deduce that yet. Is this your face? It could be.
[11162.08s -> 11174.59s]  I don't know. Is it the chin? Is it the thing face? It could be either one of those.
[11175.39s -> 11185.31s]  All right, I got, what about this one? 13, 4, 2. 13, 4. Uh-oh. No, wait, that's one. Okay.
[11185.87s -> 11197.92s]  This could be the two or the four. It's probably the four. One, two, three, five, 10, 12, 13.
[11198.72s -> 11215.04s]  Well, let's deduce it. 10, 11, 12, 13. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 13.
[11215.04s -> 11221.66s]  I'm going to assume this is the four. I don't think that's the two.
[11229.07s -> 11239.20s]  All we have left is fours and threes, so this has to be connected. This could be this way first,
[11239.20s -> 11246.27s]  so this is good. It's not singles. It has to be connected. Not singles. Wait, hold on. Wait,
[11246.83s -> 11259.30s]  I don't know that. That's not for sure. 2, 13. It can't be any of these. Oh, shit. There we go.
[11259.30s -> 11269.09s]  13. Oh, there's your three. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. Definitely not that way.
[11274.88s -> 11286.27s]  We got 16, two. There's, I got one here. Four. One, two, three, four. This has to be one of
[11286.27s -> 11305.07s]  these two, right? Is it the goblin face? It could be anything. It's part of the three. 19, 22, 26.
[11306.27s -> 11323.79s]  I love this song. This is awesome. Piss? Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm going to go piss.
[11324.67s -> 11459.23s]  Be right back. Go pee. See you in a minute. I swear to God. I swear to God. That was an animation.
[11459.23s -> 11478.03s]  That's cool. There's no escape from you guys. That was terrifying. Very, very cool. Let's
[11478.03s -> 11494.08s]  head back to it. That's so cute. What I was going to say is I swear to God, when I drink water,
[11494.56s -> 11499.84s]  you know, when you fill up like a Brita filter and it takes maybe five to 10 minutes, maybe 15
[11499.84s -> 11505.28s]  minutes. But when you pour it at the top, it filters the water down at the bottom. I swear
[11505.28s -> 11512.56s]  to God, that's what my body does. I drink a water and my inner Brita filter just does it. Just takes
[11512.56s -> 11518.43s]  all the impurities and I piss it out within 10 minutes. Why do I pee? I have to pee so much.
[11518.43s -> 11527.55s]  Why do I pee all the time? Why am I constantly peeing? I think I process urine faster than a
[11527.55s -> 11542.40s]  Brita filter does. Anyways, you need to replace your filters. It's your kidneys. I've had my
[11542.40s -> 11547.52s]  kidneys checked. I've had my kidneys ultrasound. I've had blood work from my kidneys. There's
[11547.52s -> 11552.08s]  nothing wrong with them. They're like perfect. But how? They're not. They need to be more efficient.
[11553.50s -> 11566.56s]  Are they too efficient? All right. Anyways, where are we? Your kidneys are fucking jacked.
[11567.92s -> 11578.59s]  All right. Here's the three. Close that up. Over efficient kidneys. We have some info here.
[11579.49s -> 11592.64s]  Three, nine, one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine. You can't do it. You're pregnant.
[11593.44s -> 11606.18s]  Oh, shit. Hold on. So this is the eight or the seven? This is probably the seven.
[11609.23s -> 11616.00s]  Seven, none. Then we have eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[11617.04s -> 11625.42s]  We got how many spaces do we have? Five, 10, 11, nine, eight. That. Perfect. So that's one. We got
[11625.50s -> 11635.73s]  a one and a three, one and a two, one and a two, one and a two, one and a two.
[11638.21s -> 11654.03s]  This is the six. Oh, two and a two, one, two. Oh, yeah. It's definitely the thing,
[11654.03s -> 11666.10s]  face. It for sure is. All right. So what about this? This is seven and the two is
[11666.10s -> 11680.14s]  somewhere over here. Is 12 fit here now? You cannot deduce it. We have to go like this.
[11681.68s -> 11689.46s]  Three. All right. And then six, which is done already. What's left up here? Just a couple of
[11689.46s -> 11707.90s]  ones. Yeah, this is custom made. This is on the workshop. One, two. This is part of the two.
[11710.02s -> 11718.26s]  Therefore, this is part of the 10. That's 12. Yeah. OK. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[11718.34s -> 11739.34s]  10. Hey, wait, I can't be there and can't be there either. Wrong. No, it's not. It's the dump truck.
[11739.34s -> 11749.92s]  No, it's only the thing face. It's a baby elephant sitting on his hind legs. That's an amazing
[11749.92s -> 11757.41s]  imagination you have. OK, cool. This is like looking at a cloud. Everybody sees something
[11757.41s -> 11773.90s]  different. Nineteen. Well, it's obviously not down there. It's a baby dragon. Oh, I could probably
[11774.14s -> 11786.96s]  see that. Wow. Well, this has to be the six because there's no way it has to be filled in.
[11786.96s -> 11804.37s]  What is this one? Wait, one. What did I do? One, two, six, two, six. Wait, where am I?
[11805.70s -> 11816.00s]  One, two, six, two, 11. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, God, this is wrong.
[11816.00s -> 11822.99s]  What happened? This is so many numbers. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, back up, back up, back up.
[11822.99s -> 11840.91s]  What did I take away? God, I need to like zoom in. Jesus, this is painful. Two, six,
[11843.58s -> 11858.96s]  two. No, that's correct. What? Two right here and then 11, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
[11858.96s -> 11877.87s]  eleven, ten, four, two. Okay, is there four in here? Anything else I can do in here in the meantime?
[11877.87s -> 11888.05s]  Three, nine. Okay, that's done. This is 14, three and a bunch of other stuff. This is 15, four,
[11889.09s -> 11903.39s]  a bunch of other stuff. 23, one, one, 17, two, one, 16, one. Oh, yeah, let's just together. Hold on.
[11903.87s -> 11914.29s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, 13, 14, 15. Let's see, so it can't be down here, right?
[11917.18s -> 11931.66s]  15, 16, so it can't be either one of these. That would be 14 this way. Is that correct?
[11935.04s -> 11946.72s]  11, 12, 13, 14. Hell yeah. I was done. One, two. This is nine. Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[11947.52s -> 11974.00s]  And this one is, hold on, slow down. Eight, one, two, six, seven, eight, three, two, three, three.
[11974.00s -> 11998.80s]  All right. 12, two. We're getting there. Almost did his that face. This is two. It'll be that way
[11998.80s -> 12006.48s]  and then it would be one, two, three, four. Jeremy, can you help me with my homework? Yes,
[12006.48s -> 12017.28s]  a multiple choice. Question one through 10. A, C, B, A, C, A, A, A, B, D, A, D, B, A, B, D, C,
[12017.28s -> 12044.78s]  A, C, D, B. Done. A, C, D, C. That was more than 10. Oops, that was like 12, whatever. Who has
[12044.78s -> 12054.00s]  multiple choice for homework? That would be so awesome. Oh my God, that would be incredible,
[12054.00s -> 12059.49s]  wouldn't it? You don't have to get it right. You just have to hand it in. You imagine being in
[12059.49s -> 12067.41s]  homeroom and just writing like B, A, B, B, B, D, C, A, B, B, D, B, B. Done. Hand it in.
[12067.41s -> 12075.73s]  Does everybody have their homework? Yeah, I do. Here it is. Oh, okay. Thank you. Check for the day
[12075.73s -> 12096.16s]  of bringing your homework in. Do the bottom row? No, I can't do the bottom row. Why did you lie to
[12096.16s -> 12130.11s]  me? Bottom left. Five, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22. All right. Give it your best. Mine was better. All
[12130.11s -> 12164.62s]  right. 15, 5, 10, 15, 9, 3, 1, 11, 2. Now it's done. 16 this way. 2, that's done. Okay. Nice.
[12165.18s -> 12201.81s]  Oh shit. What happened here? What happened down here? 22, 16, 2 is busted. Is it?
[12202.61s -> 12228.14s]  Bottom right should not have Xs. Is this 22 though? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
[12228.22s -> 12244.51s]  19, 20. No, that was wrong too because it could know it was right. Then there's a 2 in here.
[12248.80s -> 12273.90s]  Um, there's nothing here. Or here. It can't be. 16 to the right one? 16 to the right one.
[12274.86s -> 12282.72s]  When are you gonna play The Sims 1? Um, when I get back. That's what the first thing will do.
[12283.36s -> 12292.48s]  I'm really looking forward to playing it. This is a pretty lackluster 500k stream. I didn't even
[12292.48s -> 12298.16s]  know I was at 500,000 followers. You told me that an hour ago. I didn't have time,
[12298.16s -> 12305.25s]  didn't really have time to prepare a 500,000 follower stream. Look, the archaeology stream
[12305.25s -> 12316.10s]  was for 500,000 followers. There you go. You're actually at 500. This is wrong somehow down here
[12316.10s -> 12350.40s]  and I don't know what the problem is. 19, can't be any of these. That's 3. Where are these last two?
[12350.40s -> 12369.63s]  The 1, 16 row, please. 1, 16 row. Here. What's wrong with it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13,
[12369.63s -> 12386.66s]  14, 15, 16. What's wrong with it? What's the matter with it? Attach it to the wall.
[12387.62s -> 12401.18s]  You mean like this? Then, oh man, it's starting to get painful to look at. So many numbers.
[12401.98s -> 12411.68s]  Um, so then this would have to go away because that's your two, but then there's not 14 here
[12411.68s -> 12440.83s]  anymore. 11, 12, 13, 14, which 13, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16. Shit! On the right is not the two.
[12442.43s -> 12452.54s]  Look, there's like a hundred numbers on the screen. Bottom right two. This is, this is
[12452.54s -> 12469.55s]  fucked up though. 23 isn't right. God damn it, man. That connects to make 16. This does? Wait.
[12472.06s -> 12479.74s]  This is 16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
[12481.84s -> 12501.36s]  Two. That's over. There's still shit that's wrong. 18. These are connected. 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[12502.00s -> 12543.58s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Uh oh. 9. This is 2, 4, 15. 1, 2, 3, 15, 4.
[12545.41s -> 12554.58s]  And 4, 4, 2. There's a 1 in there. Move 16 on the right down 1.
[12558.80s -> 12589.92s]  Like that. Like that. Do we got it? I don't know. Okay, so now that's 18.
[12591.97s -> 12609.49s]  Two in here somewhere. 5, 10, 6, 12, 8, 6, 1. That's blocked. But this is wrong. Oh wait,
[12610.13s -> 12632.37s]  change that. That's 5 now. This is 9. We believe in you. 2, 2, 2, 2 at 2, 2, 1, and 26, 1. What?
[12633.57s -> 12657.55s]  Somebody just said true? 26, 1, the 1 goes to the very bottom. 26, 1. 1 to the 1 to the 2.
[12658.19s -> 12680.43s]  1, 1 to the 2 to the 1. 2 to the 1 to the 1 to the 2 to the 6. Get out of here.
[12681.15s -> 12687.82s]  All right, so this is 16, 2. That's done. What about this one? This is 1, 2. This is the 3.
[12689.01s -> 12699.98s]  This is the 12. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This is the 3. 1, 2, 3. Can't be here.
[12699.98s -> 12719.57s]  1, 2, 3. Can't be here. 5, 12. That one's done. This whole row is done. 4, 12, 1. Can't be any of
[12719.57s -> 12738.22s]  these. This one now is 1, 3, 5, 6. Is he streaming from his bathroom? Streaming from his bathroom.
[12739.26s -> 12763.89s]  I mean, I guess I'll give you a courtesy flush. Okay, where were we? Is this 12 in here? No,
[12763.89s -> 12773.47s]  I can't. This is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 12. Can't do that. This row's done. Do I have everything
[12773.47s -> 12787.22s]  blocked off that needs to be blocked off? 22, 1. This is it right here, right? Where else would
[12787.22s -> 12812.53s]  that 1 go? Here's the 2. It's with the 3 and then 20. That's done. Nice. Why highlight your message
[12812.53s -> 12827.12s]  when the word toilet will catch his eye? That's a really good point. 18. None of these make any sense.
[12828.08s -> 12844.98s]  I really love Germestreams. Toilet. What community Jake on? I want to talk to him. Well, that's too
[12844.98s -> 12850.72s]  bad. What do you want to talk to him about? Huh? What do you want to talk to him about?
[12853.38s -> 12861.12s]  Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet.
[12861.12s -> 12884.16s]  Toilet. Let me just finish this and stop distracting me. 5, 10, 2. This is 11, 11, 5. All right.
[12885.00s -> 12887.00s]  six twelve
[12887.16s -> 12890.36s]  Okay, well, how many one two?
[12894.66s -> 12905.19s]  Wait nice three. Ah ha
[12907.71s -> 12912.01s]  aha
[12912.01s -> 12919.14s]  Require you you require my assistance. Ah ha ha ha ha ha
[12919.82s -> 12928.38s]  Ha that's not Trump. Why is that Trump?
[12929.98s -> 12934.24s]  Aha, you require my how is that Trump? What are you talking about?
[12934.54s -> 12946.19s]  eight six one two
[12946.39s -> 12954.01s]  three four five six one two
[12954.61s -> 12961.95s]  nine seven that's a four
[12962.59s -> 12967.56s]  this is a
[12967.56s -> 12968.88s]  two
[12968.88s -> 12971.84s]  two six three six
[12972.48s -> 12976.34s]  Show us the real Trump voice. Okay
[12977.88s -> 12980.36s]  Okay, I'm doing anything you want to do
[12981.36s -> 12984.80s]  Yeah, I don't have any other questions, please
[12988.52s -> 13000.62s]  two three four five six nine nine
[13004.23s -> 13007.82s]  eight nine
[13007.82s -> 13008.94s]  four
[13008.94s -> 13016.31s]  four
[13016.31s -> 13020.54s]  politics
[13020.58s -> 13028.31s]  That's my favorite cupcake flavor toilet
[13032.64s -> 13037.93s]  It's probably I'm less of a cupcake guy and more of a muffin guy
[13037.93s -> 13050.69s]  I think muffins are better cupcakes, especially when they're really dense. I like a nice dense blueberry muffin
[13051.05s -> 13058.63s]  That is what I want more wet less dry. I don't like a dry cake like cupcake. It's gonna be moist
[13059.19s -> 13063.07s]  So this is how I give you the my determination for what that would mean by this
[13063.39s -> 13066.49s]  If you take a muffin and you squish a piece of it between your fingers
[13066.71s -> 13073.72s]  If it sticks together and acts like a snowball like it squishes together and is wet. It's slightly damp
[13074.08s -> 13077.86s]  That's how you know, you've got a great muffin like slightly moist
[13081.31s -> 13088.10s]  blueberry moist dense muffin or chocolate chip or coffee cake a coffee cake muffin
[13089.18s -> 13094.13s]  Cupcakes are I think that junk I do because all you do is you just bite the top off and just
[13094.45s -> 13095.73s]  Put the right you don't even eat the rest of it
[13095.73s -> 13101.00s]  The actual cake part of a cupcake is a good part that I don't like to eat
[13101.00s -> 13107.09s]  So why just might as well just take a spoonful of frosting out of the container. That's what I want
[13107.09s -> 13122.89s]  All right, let's connect this. This is five here one, two, three, four five finish that one yet
[13122.89s -> 13132.62s]  I don't know where these go. All right. There's my funny four here one, two, three four one, two, three four
[13133.34s -> 13142.36s]  one of these one three two four one three two four one
[13142.88s -> 13167.37s]  Be six. Oh shit. I can't be anywhere in here. Wait, hold on another two in here. That's actually pretty great
[13167.37s -> 13169.37s]  Yeah, it is. I sure he's passing really good
[13169.73s -> 13184.47s]  It's almost done over to this other side here. Anything be completed here five five eleven five
[13188.39s -> 13217.48s]  Well, this is this the best song in the whole album I love this one it's fantastic or I need to pick a place and just stay
[13217.80s -> 13223.86s]  These are all done. This is done. This is done. This whole everything over here is done. I need to look be looking this way
[13224.66s -> 13235.46s]  13 here we go. All right, one two, four 13
[13236.14s -> 13244.01s]  There we go to wait a minute. This is wrong
[13245.58s -> 13247.82s]  nine
[13254.06s -> 13256.55s]  What happened 13 is too long
[13276.70s -> 13288.55s]  Move 13 up one six one
[13289.31s -> 13290.55s]  two
[13290.55s -> 13311.27s]  I subverted and this would be one three two one three two two
[13312.51s -> 13321.26s]  takes care of that
[13321.62s -> 13332.06s]  nine seven two three
[13332.74s -> 13335.60s]  three six or
[13335.96s -> 13338.15s]  one
[13338.15s -> 13340.15s]  One one here in here
[13340.27s -> 13353.70s]  Someone made this. Yeah, they did. Does it kill him when the clock reaches an hour? I've never seen the song movie before. Oh
[13359.47s -> 13364.04s]  Six one six eight
[13365.04s -> 13369.47s]  It's a three in here too. One two three
[13371.35s -> 13395.49s]  Shit, I don't know. Mmm, the one goes over here. I have no idea. All right, so I'm gonna concentrate
[13396.09s -> 13398.26s]  I'm not I'm just not I'm gonna stop talking
[13398.78s -> 13403.18s]  So I'm just gonna concentrate and stop speaking, but it's okay. You'll still hear things
[13403.70s -> 13406.02s]  Not like any of this commentary has changed at all
[13406.58s -> 13412.89s]  Shit, I don't know
[13412.89s -> 13423.79s]  Mmm, shit. I don't know if the one goes over here
[13424.27s -> 13430.57s]  The one goes over here. I have no idea
[13434.95s -> 13444.62s]  Mmm, the one goes over here. I have no idea shit. I don't know. I have no idea shit. I don't know. Mmm
[13445.18s -> 13454.96s]  The one goes over here. The one goes over here. Mmm. The one goes over here shit. I don't know. I'm done. That's annoying
[13455.96s -> 13460.50s]  do six
[13460.86s -> 13478.90s]  Just solve it. What are you? What do you think? I'm doing it six one two, three, four, five six
[13485.04s -> 13486.24s]  six
[13486.24s -> 13499.43s]  Is it two in here? There's another six in here. Mmm
[13503.67s -> 13505.82s]  Mmm
[13505.82s -> 13510.35s]  Mmm, I think the one goes over here. I think the one goes over here
[13511.18s -> 13518.42s]  Shit, I have no idea. I have no idea. I think the one goes over here. I have no idea. Mmm
[13518.74s -> 13522.95s]  I think the one goes over here. I think the one goes over here. I have no idea shit. I don't know
[13523.87s -> 13534.34s]  eight six one two three four five six
[13535.10s -> 13537.38s]  One wait, did that do something for me? Sixteen one
[13539.26s -> 13541.26s]  Dude, there's a two in here
[13541.70s -> 13543.26s]  There's another four
[13543.26s -> 13545.26s]  There's a three and a three and a four
[13545.66s -> 13577.10s]  Okay, wait, nice. Okay, that one's done. Finally
[13582.81s -> 13583.97s]  18
[13583.97s -> 13598.35s]  Where's the 18?
[13604.85s -> 13616.02s]  Three four seven seven six four four three
[13616.86s -> 13618.86s]  Nice. All right, we're almost done
[13618.86s -> 13621.86s]  Very very close one two
[13622.42s -> 13624.98s]  three four five six seven eight nine
[13625.98s -> 13630.96s]  One two, three, four five six seven eight nine. Oh boy
[13632.06s -> 13672.95s]  Three it's nice jazz. What? Yeah, what? Oh, this is Sims, right? I thought this was Mario Galaxy again
[13672.95s -> 13677.91s]  I feel this is not I don't think I can do the nine yet
[13683.42s -> 13686.02s]  Two three so it has to be here one two three
[13686.66s -> 13688.42s]  one two three
[13688.42s -> 13691.90s]  That would be part of the two. I'm assuming. Let's see. This is
[13692.50s -> 13693.82s]  roses
[13693.82s -> 13694.98s]  one
[13694.98s -> 13697.99s]  one two one
[13698.31s -> 13700.34s]  two
[13700.34s -> 13701.58s]  two
[13701.58s -> 13702.78s]  two
[13702.78s -> 13716.80s]  One there it is. Okay, brings us to the end here
[13717.56s -> 13721.01s]  This is what's wrong with that? What's wrong with the eye?
[13721.85s -> 13725.47s]  or
[13725.47s -> 13733.82s]  I've one two three four five one two three four five one two three four five
[13734.78s -> 13736.78s]  one three
[13736.94s -> 13740.63s]  one two
[13740.67s -> 13743.79s]  This is done
[13743.83s -> 13749.62s]  One what's going what's wrong with his eye?

[13939.90s -> 13943.00s]  X's don't belong on one four four three
[13943.68s -> 13949.82s]  Okay. Um
[13951.21s -> 13955.26s]  This is a really bad stream. Hope you have a great three weeks Jeremy. Good night
[13955.86s -> 13958.81s]  No, you could have just said the second part

[13986.33s -> 13988.33s]  I guess this is where it's name
[13996.47s -> 13998.47s]  Sims 1
[14001.60s -> 14004.06s]  Where I
[14004.06s -> 14009.58s]  Can't even look I don't know. I'm lost completely. I'm like I'm my brains over
[14009.58s -> 14019.16s]  My brains fried is done. I'm so close. But like I can't finish it
[14019.40s -> 14022.40s]  This is like when you study right before the exam and you get to the point
[14022.40s -> 14026.88s]  We're at like the flashcard number 20 like 30 50 500 and you're like, I can't look at this anymore
[14026.88s -> 14030.95s]  If I like went to sleep and woke up and came back, I probably would beat this
[14031.57s -> 14037.95s]  one
[14037.95s -> 14046.18s]  The fact that I have to look all the way down the screen. Okay, two three six four one
[14046.70s -> 14048.70s]  There's two ones in here somewhere
[14065.12s -> 14071.18s]  There's like two in the wrong spot and I'll just never figure it out top of the right eye should be filled in
[14071.18s -> 14074.10s]  Yeah, like in here, but it's like everything's moved around
[14074.90s -> 14082.37s]  Go back to the way it was before hold on like back here before I freaked out
[14082.93s -> 14093.89s]  One four five four row delete the left eye one four five four row
[14094.51s -> 14102.01s]  happened here
[14102.01s -> 14109.50s]  Your other left. Well, yeah, I thought you guys are on my left
[14110.06s -> 14123.14s]  So wait, so there's nothing he there's nothing here
[14123.62s -> 14126.95s]  How could there be nothing there?
[14126.99s -> 14131.92s]  What's wrong with this? I?
[14131.96s -> 14155.67s]  Okay, so there's a one here. I need four
[14156.55s -> 14158.55s]  or three
[14158.63s -> 14160.35s]  one two
[14160.35s -> 14162.35s]  one two
[14162.63s -> 14164.87s]  That right, I think
[14166.99s -> 14178.76s]  Exactly, that's correct. There's another one
[14179.44s -> 14195.83s]  Okay, there's this two one four four three has an incorrect X one four four three
[14196.45s -> 14208.40s]  One four five four still wrong. It's so close. I just had it's it's just pissing me off
[14209.00s -> 14228.74s]  Get rid of the X's in your left. Eye. They're wrong. So race the entire eye
[14236.29s -> 14242.25s]  Six it's just so much fucking info three six six. This is done. Like this is correct
[14244.20s -> 14253.30s]  That's it. There's no more you can't put the sixes anywhere else. This is done, too. It has to be right
[14253.30s -> 14264.02s]  I can't put this over here. The mouth is wrong. What the top row is wrong
[14268.81s -> 14289.06s]  I'm not gonna reset
[14289.06s -> 14295.26s]  I just I'm at that point where there's like five things wrong and really specific place and it requires me moving the whole fucking
[14295.34s -> 14316.40s]  Picture like five pixels to the left fuck Hearthstone get off. All right, I'm gonna start the bottom eight six
[14316.92s -> 14327.01s]  one six three six three five
[14329.02s -> 14331.97s]  two two
[14332.45s -> 14336.22s]  six six three
[14338.37s -> 14342.03s]  Reads a four is this the other four?
[14342.99s -> 14344.91s]  Was it in here?
[14344.91s -> 14347.79s]  That kind of has to be in here
[14348.03s -> 14353.73s]  Get rid of all the X's in one four four three all of them
[14354.49s -> 14368.20s]  Shift the nine on the top row one space to the right
[14369.16s -> 14385.72s]  Okay, now what?
[14385.84s -> 14387.12s]  now
[14387.12s -> 14390.06s]  the left has the left two has to
[14390.62s -> 14395.86s]  re
[14395.86s -> 14399.89s]  These are done. These are done. What was this?
[14400.57s -> 14408.41s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me do I need to go like they inject protein like into my neck
[14408.41s -> 14421.59s]  I I'm my brain can't do it anymore. That's the one that's scary
[14422.59s -> 14437.11s]  Look at the two look at the grip. All right, but they're out like they're like 15 twos here. You're so close
[14437.11s -> 14441.87s]  I know but like it's like one of those things like fucking where's Waldo if you can see Waldo
[14441.87s -> 14445.11s]  I know but I can't see Waldo. I have no idea where Waldo is
[14445.15s -> 14466.67s]  He could be like with a chef's hat on right here flipping pancakes. I can't see him. He's right there
[14467.79s -> 14473.95s]  Sucks when you get this far like you I can't piece it together. I'm turning off chat. I'm minimizing the window
[14473.99s -> 14476.98s]  I have to just fucking sit here and stare at it

[14692.14s -> 14697.92s]  You're fucked. Take a look at this column. You're fucked one
[14698.44s -> 14702.99s]  one three
[14702.99s -> 14705.14s]  four
[14705.14s -> 14706.30s]  one
[14706.30s -> 14721.38s]  Two one there has to be a two in here. Where's the two go here? Where's the two go here then the two two?
[14721.92s -> 14727.90s]  Five take the five six one column and move it three left
[14728.42s -> 14741.82s]  Why can't I finish this? There's no five six one column
[14742.30s -> 14745.12s]  Where's the five six one?
[14747.16s -> 14756.44s]  Two two six six three is wrong toilet two two six six three move the second to right one
[14756.52s -> 14758.52s]  That's what you just told me to do the opposite
[14759.08s -> 14780.53s]  Two two six six three. What was it move the second to right one two two six six three
[14781.63s -> 14800.36s]  Overwrite twice toilet like that two to the one to the one to the three toilet

[14890.59s -> 14897.70s]  Okay, 15. All right, let's get this one done. All right that thank you. That was a lot
[14897.70s -> 14900.02s]  I really appreciate the help because I was stuck and I was locked
[14900.30s -> 14909.13s]  Well 13 so we can do if we deduce that this could happen to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
[14909.53s -> 14917.63s]  It's the whole damn thing. It's been deduced 10 11 12 13 14
[14918.23s -> 14921.35s]  We can deduce that
[14921.55s -> 14934.10s]  Yeah, one is that okay. You're the one in yesterday. I mean, I'm on Pacific time. So all right, what else we got?
[14934.78s -> 14941.63s]  Seven eight you're 15 downs. Therefore. That's fine. Five ten eleven twelve thirteen
[14942.45s -> 14952.65s]  single four
[14952.65s -> 14953.69s]  nine
[14953.69s -> 14961.89s]  So we got one two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen twelve eleven ten nine one two
[14961.89s -> 14971.10s]  Three four filament one two, three four filament secret boop 15 down
[14971.10s -> 14983.62s]  Is there a 15 down? Where do you see 15 down? 10 11 12. So just go like this and we got 10
[14983.62s -> 14988.50s]  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2 on each side
[14989.54s -> 15003.20s]  Left 2 are done. Oh shit. I think we can finish this one 5 10
[15004.32s -> 15007.16s]  11 12 13 we can so that's 5
[15008.04s -> 15010.60s]  1 5
[15010.72s -> 15013.14s]  Cool
[15013.14s -> 15017.40s]  This is probably this looks like fireman bridge the 8 up
[15017.88s -> 15021.66s]  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[15022.54s -> 15032.78s]  Wait, no, hold on. Hold on. This is for one of the fours
[15033.50s -> 15036.72s]  That's probably the first four. Yes, of course it is
[15040.17s -> 15045.01s]  7 1 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 there we go
[15045.81s -> 15048.25s]  to the top row
[15048.25s -> 15051.38s]  Okay, this is the 5
[15051.70s -> 15054.58s]  1 2 3 4 5 can't be these ones. Oh
[15055.22s -> 15063.72s]  We need music. Yeah
[15064.04s -> 15073.16s]  7 1 4 is a free toilet. Okay, 7 1 4 is a free toilet 7 1 7
[15074.31s -> 15082.98s]  1 space or I believe this one is 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
[15083.58s -> 15084.94s]  No, not quite
[15084.94s -> 15088.73s]  Or 1 4 is a free toilet or
[15089.33s -> 15098.32s]  Correct. Okay, so we got 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 4
[15099.08s -> 15105.59s]  Okay
[15106.95s -> 15108.95s]  1 2 3

[17048.67s -> 17052.38s]  Would have been nice if I was using that the whole time
[17052.90s -> 17056.23s]  That was that's too bad. But whatever
[17056.63s -> 17072.68s]  One there's three

[17078.37s -> 17084.71s]  three

[17117.22s -> 17121.58s]  Yeah, I all right
[17121.58s -> 17128.39s]  Let's make sure we reiterate this one more time. You know, I'm like, I'm repeat myself Andy tonight, but I kind of have to
[17128.95s -> 17130.95s]  Only I want to make sure everyone knows what's going on
[17132.76s -> 17135.96s]  If you missed the first part of the stream you missed the middle part of the stream
[17136.40s -> 17146.02s]  Get the credits rolling too. By the way, there was a lot of community subs. Thank you everybody. Let's go over this very quickly
[17146.74s -> 17152.98s]  Let's go. No, why don't I just go I got to talk about this one more time
[17153.54s -> 17158.14s]  So I'm gonna be taking some absence here
[17159.58s -> 17165.02s]  I'm going to finalize and get to the absolute treatment plan of
[17165.74s -> 17172.28s]  This chest and back problem that I've had what's likely to happen is over the next few weeks
[17172.28s -> 17175.96s]  I'm going to try to get either intercostal
[17176.56s -> 17178.99s]  Injections to shut it up
[17179.51s -> 17183.99s]  Probably do it a few places somewhere along the spine
[17185.03s -> 17192.12s]  Trigger points and an intercostal potential intercostal nerve injection. I'm gonna try it. I want to try it
[17192.20s -> 17193.64s]  I want to do it
[17193.64s -> 17196.71s]  Because there's a lot of stuff going on in 2021
[17198.22s -> 17201.74s]  The I'm essentially we're we're hitting the ground running on a lot of projects
[17202.30s -> 17206.70s]  So there are at least four or five more streams
[17207.50s -> 17211.19s]  Like the archaeology stream that you will see within the next six months
[17212.87s -> 17217.19s]  This is not like oh, yeah, there's worse. You know, I get like a year when we do something like that again
[17218.57s -> 17224.46s]  Because of the nature of doing as many of these as we kind of can in 2021. I have to get this under control
[17225.90s -> 17233.00s]  I also have some family stuff and some personal stuff to take care of too. So this is likely to be the final break
[17234.49s -> 17235.69s]  before I
[17235.69s -> 17242.04s]  Hopefully get over this bullshit with my back and chest and everything and if it's not then i'll keep doing it
[17242.04s -> 17246.28s]  But this i'm at least gonna go get the injections. I'm gonna i'm gonna just I talked to my doctor about it
[17246.52s -> 17249.91s]  We're setting up a plan. I'm just gonna be like
[17250.63s -> 17252.97s]  Just stick me just stick them in me
[17254.47s -> 17258.62s]  Because I want to get I need to get a treatment plan. I have to it's been too long with this shit
[17258.70s -> 17264.95s]  It's been three years now, obviously I ruled out all the bad stuff and that's what I was doing the two or three months
[17264.95s -> 17268.47s]  I was gone ruling out everything that could be terrible
[17270.36s -> 17273.10s]  But it's time to take care of it
[17273.10s -> 17278.76s]  So I will see you on april 1st and on april 2nd
[17278.84s -> 17282.04s]  I will have a shitload of announcements some stuff you're probably really going to look forward to
[17282.36s -> 17288.71s]  I know you have a lot of questions about the streams that you may have seen about roto beasts
[17289.50s -> 17294.54s]  Just hold off. I will give you way more details. There'll be a lot of announcements in a few weeks

[17321.10s -> 17324.44s]  I'll be real with you. That's kind of the sad part about this for me is
[17325.88s -> 17330.84s]  The channel is like at peak popularity right now like the last like eight to ten months
[17331.69s -> 17335.96s]  And i'm just like fucking off every three months or so, you know what I mean?
[17336.76s -> 17339.24s]  So that's like kind of sad but at the end of the day
[17341.08s -> 17345.64s]  I never cared about that shit. Anyways, you know this channel could have 5 000 viewers
[17346.36s -> 17348.14s]  2 000 viewers or 20 000 viewers
[17348.22s -> 17352.60s]  I'm still gonna just keep doing the things that I do and if you think it's fun if you're here then

[17371.54s -> 17374.23s]  There was just so much
[17375.08s -> 17380.46s]  It was like an overwhelming amount of things that we were seeing for the stream for the archaeology thing and i'm just so happy that
[17381.11s -> 17384.60s]  um a lot of people involved in that project got like the
[17385.08s -> 17390.31s]  Attention and the recognition that they deserved and i'm really really happy about the nevada science center stuff, too

[17466.41s -> 17468.41s]  Run the simpson stream
[17468.57s -> 17471.29s]  I actually might do that because it's so stupid
