[15.17s -> 21.35s]  First-person free game by the way link is in the description really loud in my ear. It's a first-person pac-man
[22.13s -> 29.72s]  Terrifying adventure. So with that said it's pretty self-explanatory. It's first-person pac-man and here we go
[29.72s -> 35.82s]  I got a mini map in the top right. I should be looking at that. Okay, there's one
[35.90s -> 48.91s]  All right, there's the pac-man Superball I can eat that and all my troubles will be over. Oh, will it?
[48.91s -> 53.02s]  Oh, will it? Oh, will it? Oh, I'm gonna wrap around. We're wrapping around this way
[56.25s -> 58.15s]  That's a double kill

[93.34s -> 97.18s]  There we are
[97.18s -> 101.58s]  I'm gonna be level one. Let's hope I beat this
[106.12s -> 115.38s]  All right, there's a yellow there's a yellow piece of crap. I think I just saw the pink did I I don't know

[165.55s -> 170.86s]  Don't have very I think I only have one more of those balls left. I
[171.50s -> 174.87s]  think I can only put like one more ball in my mouth before I
[175.95s -> 185.27s]  How long is this level is this really this huge of a level or is pac-man really this big?
[185.75s -> 195.47s]  Come on. Come on. I want you all to come over here. Come on. Where are they going?
[195.47s -> 201.08s]  What the hell are you guys doing? Come on. All right

[207.26s -> 211.90s]  This is my last shot right here guys, this is the only last one I can get I gotta get rid of these dudes
[212.66s -> 220.98s]  Gotta kill at least two or three of them. I'll just hopefully I can finish this
[221.70s -> 233.27s]  They're all scattered around the whole damn map. I'm so dead. There's three over here. There's like five over there
[233.79s -> 239.34s]  Damn it. Oh

[252.14s -> 257.79s]  I wish I could hit M and see just how like huge this map really is
[258.31s -> 262.43s]  Because I feel like it's it's pac-man was not this big
[262.95s -> 280.44s]  Could be wrong though. Damn it. Oh, this is it. It was a yellow one. Let's go again one more time
[280.44s -> 287.18s]  This is it. This is the last try you talk about like jump scares
[287.58s -> 292.49s]  This game has like this is like this is like scarier than some of the games I've played
[293.09s -> 299.98s]  All right. I got a piece of candy ready. I got like an orbiting piece of bubblegum. I'm ready to take it
[299.98s -> 308.07s]  Let's go this way first one dude over here. Come on. Go the other way. Go the other way. Go the other way

[371.03s -> 375.55s]  Thank you so much for watching. This has been FPS man link in the description. It's free
[375.55s -> 379.67s]  You can go scare the hell out of yourself and try to beat my high score
[379.67s -> 382.41s]  Which is probably gonna be pretty easy because it was just level one
[382.41s -> 386.11s]  There's probably some of you guys that are at like level 30 and I beat this whole damn game
[386.11s -> 392.39s]  But anyways guys, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it and I'll see y'all next time. Of course, take care everybody
