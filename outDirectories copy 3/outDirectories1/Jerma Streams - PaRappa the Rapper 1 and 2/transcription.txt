[1.14s -> 8.31s]  Good afternoon. How's everybody doing? Welcome, welcome, welcome to another live stream
[10.02s -> 27.86s]  right from my house in my room. Welcome. Today we are going to play fake, instant fake stream.
[35.14s -> 40.66s]  Now today we're going to do the Parappa games. I said when I came back after the few days there
[42.22s -> 48.04s]  that I was going to do the thing, we're going to finish the thing. I just got too far into that.
[48.04s -> 54.31s]  It's like nine and a half hours. There's probably only like 45 minutes to an hour left in the thing.
[55.11s -> 59.11s]  So I figured instead of starting with that, we're going to end with that.
[59.91s -> 64.23s]  Because those of you that want to watch the end of the thing, you'll, I mean, you might be here
[64.23s -> 69.13s]  right now and going, oh yeah, I want to see the end of the thing. So I'd rather put that at the
[69.13s -> 75.11s]  end of the stream. So the beginning of the stream, we're going to do the Parappa games.
[75.67s -> 80.63s]  Parappa the Rapper one, Parappa the Rapper two, back to back. They're like an hour and a half each.
[80.63s -> 91.24s]  They're like I'm Jam and Lambie. So it shouldn't take us too long. Yeah, I rolled those off pretty
[91.24s -> 100.65s]  well. Don't do the Wii game. I'm on the PlayStation 4. There's a Parappa the Rapper remastered and then
[100.65s -> 111.82s]  Parappa the Rapper 2 is just on PS4, on PSN. So this is not the, they made a Wii version of this game?
[116.15s -> 125.18s]  Parappa on the Wii? I don't remember that being a thing. Isn't this a Sony? This is a Sony franchise.
[127.26s -> 144.66s]  The Wii? The only in the US one. Oh, one guy said that. All right. Well, whatever. All right. Give me
[144.66s -> 150.58s]  one second. While I just make sure this is plugged in correctly, we're going to have to do a sync test
[151.14s -> 157.54s]  so people don't think I have no rhythm. Because here's, I got to make this clear, really clear.
[158.18s -> 162.50s]  When you're watching me play a rhythm game, it might not be exactly sync correctly because it
[162.50s -> 171.21s]  takes 600 plus milliseconds for me to travel to you through the capture card. So sometimes it's a
[171.21s -> 175.37s]  little bit, it's a little off. But if I press triangle, when it's like triangles on the screen,
[175.37s -> 179.53s]  it might be like a centimeter off. And people go, wow, he's fucking terrible. He has no idea
[179.53s -> 184.90s]  what he's doing. He has no rhythm. No, it's the, it's the interface. I'm going through an interface.
[185.86s -> 193.74s]  Remember that. The next, the next time I fuck up a level, it's because of the interface I'm on.
[195.40s -> 205.45s]  Not me. He's already making excuses. No, I'm making excuses for you. No, I'm not. No, no excuses.
[205.45s -> 211.66s]  Let's go. Rapper the Rapper, remastered. I'm on the right. Yeah, that's correct, right? Rapper the
[211.66s -> 225.42s]  Rapper. Let's go. Lying through his teeth. This is a classic video game. It's an old one, PlayStation
[225.42s -> 230.33s]  one. I don't know what the remaster, how do you remaster this game? What is there to remaster?
[232.22s -> 243.00s]  It's just songs and button presses. Is it just updated graphics? Is it the music? Like the music's
[243.00s -> 261.59s]  at a CD quality, not this DVD quality. Oh, I remember this. This is freaking me out. I played
[261.59s -> 264.55s]  this when I was like 15. All right, I'll shut up.
[283.94s -> 287.86s]  This is so 2000s. This game is so 2000s.
[298.74s -> 300.90s]  No, that's impossible. Sorry.
[322.95s -> 325.03s]  What are you going to have for rapper?
[332.07s -> 350.49s]  Next, please. Water. Here it is. Oh, yeah, he just gets a water. I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it
[350.49s -> 369.10s]  with him. You gotta do what? I believe. Zinked up. That was my test. Is it good? Perfect. All right,
[369.10s -> 375.90s]  let me just make sure I don't look. One, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three. Should be
[375.90s -> 384.58s]  good, right? What's the menu? I forget. Practice. No, we don't need to do any of this.
[386.18s -> 393.51s]  There's no excuses for messing up now. Oh, I mean, it's a rhythm game. So it's, I mean, this one's,
[394.23s -> 401.03s]  I remember this was not that hard. It was still a fun game, but it was very, it was very basic,
[401.75s -> 410.39s]  at least in the first level or two. Does this get hard? Am I just remembering like 15 year old
[410.39s -> 416.84s]  gamer god me something you guys have to realize everybody that's in their 30s right now was a
[416.84s -> 435.50s]  fucking gamer god back when they were like 15 16 years old. I used to drink an entire case of code
[435.50s -> 440.46s]  red Mountain Dew and top drag every team fortress classic server I went into ever.
[444.70s -> 446.14s]  I haven't let the pups stay.
[448.62s -> 463.29s]  There's no need to fear because Joe chin is here. I have traveled the seven seas. I have crossed
[463.29s -> 467.85s]  every mountain known to man and I know that the mighty powers that I have are enough for jerks
[467.85s -> 473.29s]  like you. I shall put on my magic gloves of glory and shall take you on a cruise to destroy
[473.29s -> 476.89s]  all of you. Now let me pay of this one incident at this coffee shop.
[478.25s -> 486.57s]  Oh, here we go again. Let's go. Bye now. Bye. Oh, he's so annoying. I need to become a hero too.
[491.18s -> 507.80s]  How could I possibly do that? Yeah, here comes the classic song. Welcome
[508.44s -> 515.48s]  to the fruits. I trusted you are here to redeem yourself and to acquire
[515.48s -> 524.52s]  skills that are necessary for your goals. What was the line in? It changes a little.
[536.04s -> 541.24s]  Kick punch. You all remember. All right. This is a remaster. This looks this looks good.
[545.56s -> 550.65s]  Kick. It's all in the mind. If you want to test me until you're finding the things I'll teach
[550.65s -> 567.69s]  you. Let's do it. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick.
[568.09s -> 572.17s]  Oh.

[607.37s -> 608.97s]  It sounds off.
[614.49s -> 616.49s]  Oh
[629.37s -> 631.37s]  You gotta get you gotta change it up
[642.23s -> 644.23s]  That's not moving
[646.71s -> 648.71s]  Oh
[648.71s -> 650.71s]  Oh
[675.75s -> 677.75s]  Nailed it
[680.28s -> 684.04s]  Good job, you can go on to the next stage now. Yeah
[684.68s -> 686.12s]  All right

[688.12s -> 690.42s]  That was an awesome toad. Yahoo
[696.17s -> 698.25s]  The end of my simple introduction
[698.89s -> 705.53s]  Put up your fists you evil crusaders. Let me knock you out this fan made now. This is a re-release
[706.25s -> 708.25s]  You can get this on the ps4 store
[709.37s -> 715.21s]  Right now, please save your play data

[721.35s -> 723.35s]  Next
[724.23s -> 726.71s]  I would like to keep playing the game. Yes, I don't need to take a break
[728.07s -> 729.51s]  Six minutes
[729.51s -> 731.51s]  You guessed that the Wii was bad
[731.75s -> 734.31s]  The playstation one wanted you to take a break every like four and a half minutes
[736.15s -> 747.88s]  Great day today. So what do you guys want to do? Let's go down to the beach
[749.16s -> 751.16s]  Okay, sounds cool
[751.32s -> 755.64s]  Don't we need a car to get anywhere? Oh the driving one. I remember this one
[756.84s -> 758.84s]  Step on the gas step on the brake
[759.80s -> 761.80s]  I remember this
[766.04s -> 773.24s]  Yeah, the maximum speed is tuned up to four hundred sixty three thousand two hundred and final panther seats, too
[777.53s -> 787.24s]  Is this a chad chin whatever his name is? Hi ice
[788.04s -> 789.88s]  Man, it's fat
[790.98s -> 792.18s]  too
[792.18s -> 798.02s]  Not only that it's a convertible and it is capable of leaving tall buildings in a single bound
[798.66s -> 800.74s]  Would you girls like to go to the beach with me?
[801.54s -> 805.30s]  Sure, only if all of us can go of course, of course
[806.02s -> 808.02s]  Come on girls. Sit up top of me
[808.74s -> 810.74s]  You guys can sit in the back
[814.54s -> 816.54s]  Everybody hold on
[816.70s -> 818.70s]  You
[830.22s -> 834.62s]  Cut to like later on tonight when he's sitting in his bedroom with his laptop looking at his credit card statement
[835.02s -> 837.02s]  And he's just fucking sitting there crying
[837.58s -> 839.58s]  He's like
[844.63s -> 849.94s]  There's a flower like me in a car and it could take sunny anywhere
[852.49s -> 857.11s]  1000
[857.11s -> 860.60s]  Yeah, I know
[860.60s -> 866.78s]  Oh, okay. This is it. This is I love this song
[868.07s -> 870.23s]  You want to learn how to drive, huh?
[870.87s -> 876.15s]  It's harder than you think it is. It is you think you can handle it. Try this rap
[877.19s -> 879.35s]  Do you think you know how to drive rap to me?
[880.57s -> 882.09s]  Here's your license
[882.09s -> 884.25s]  You don't even know how to fucking use your turn signal
[885.29s -> 887.29s]  Let's do it
[896.38s -> 898.38s]  I don't want to sound this robotic
[906.04s -> 908.04s]  I always had trouble with this
[928.25s -> 930.25s]  Now turn to now right
[958.97s -> 960.97s]  What
[963.45s -> 967.15s]  That was not bad that was perfect sentence that was a perfect sentence
[976.92s -> 978.92s]  What
[979.64s -> 981.64s]  Now turn to the right
[993.00s -> 995.62s]  Here it is
[1003.54s -> 1007.06s]  That's that's why this game is so difficult actually now that I think about it because
[1008.18s -> 1012.82s]  If you it's like triangle triangle triangle triangle l right? That's easy triangle
[1012.90s -> 1015.22s]  Triangle triangle triangle. Oh, but the way that he talks
[1015.94s -> 1020.74s]  Do I know what we stop the target? It's just uh, it's not doesn't add up for my brain
[1021.54s -> 1036.71s]  So I end up like I I second guess like where the sentence is
[1037.35s -> 1044.26s]  place
[1044.26s -> 1050.25s]  Maybe it is
[1050.25s -> 1051.69s]  Shouldn't be
[1051.69s -> 1058.02s]  Parappa. Hey parappa. Where are you going with my car?
[1063.06s -> 1066.18s]  That shit's fucking illegal by the way
[1067.14s -> 1070.82s]  Everybody knows that you get your permit first and then you get the you can't drive
[1071.70s -> 1078.14s]  You have to have somebody that has a license in the car. Somebody should be like a licensed driver in front seat
[1079.26s -> 1085.88s]  Over 18, do you think parappa the rapper is over 18?
[1087.29s -> 1089.29s]  I thought he was like 14
[1090.09s -> 1100.36s]  He's not like 12
[1100.36s -> 1102.36s]  He's 32
[1103.32s -> 1112.74s]  This is really a lot of fun nice if we could keep driving and go someplace far dog years

[1132.07s -> 1135.99s]  I can I can understand spongebob being 30

[1216.95s -> 1230.81s]  Working in the flea market so early

[1759.86s -> 1766.90s]  Can't stop while we were shifting around all we gotta do is apply the final touches all we gotta do is apply the final touches

[1772.82s -> 1776.34s]  The clam goes there the perch goes here the clam goes here
[1776.34s -> 1781.46s]  The little tiny shrimps just go everywhere the little tiny shrimp just go every every day
[1781.46s -> 1786.02s]  Whatever you like's in the middle fiddle whatever you like's in the middle fiddle
[1786.26s -> 1790.82s]  She food cake comes just like the little seafood cake comes just like a fiddle
[1792.74s -> 1794.74s]  Does somebody say this level is bugged?
[1798.36s -> 1803.32s]  I saw it all cast like a spam. The level's actually fucked what is it?
[1807.22s -> 1809.22s]  So mad she gives birth
[1810.34s -> 1812.34s]  All right, i'm gonna get cool

[1837.37s -> 1839.37s]  Means you gotta try
[1854.63s -> 1861.11s]  I don't remember this level being bugged. It's bugged. You need to press early

[1905.34s -> 1909.82s]  Butter butter butter joins the bowl. Oh, we're making us a cake that you've never seen before
[1910.30s -> 1912.30s]  Making us a cake that you've never seen before
[1915.02s -> 1917.02s]  Heat up the oven now we on a roll
[1917.90s -> 1919.90s]  Wow
[1936.90s -> 1938.90s]  Fuck you
[1946.66s -> 1948.66s]  What the fuck
[1951.86s -> 1957.86s]  Just what we don't have because money and times is what we don't have a chicken in the kitchen is making all the sound
[1958.02s -> 1962.82s]  The cake is done while we were sitting around. All we gotta do is apply the final touches
[1962.98s -> 1969.38s]  All we gotta do is apply the final touches take off the shrimp the clam and the purchase take out the shrimp the clam and the
[1969.54s -> 1974.58s]  Purchase the crates goes here. The clam goes there. The crates goes here. The clam goes here

[2003.11s -> 2006.31s]  Oh shit, I put too much oil in the pan
[2009.98s -> 2012.34s]  So I had to press those like a quarter of a second early
[2013.30s -> 2014.50s]  You're right
[2014.50s -> 2028.09s]  You guys are right. Parappa's losing his fucking mind
[2029.29s -> 2043.50s]  Why does parappa have a three-dimensional room?
[2044.14s -> 2046.63s]  Because it's like 2d on 3d
[2047.43s -> 2049.99s]  They used to love this shit back in like the early 2000
[2050.87s -> 2068.44s]  Oh, yeah, right. I didn't I didn't wash my hands or something, right and I
[2069.24s -> 2072.44s]  Get like diarrhea from the cake

[2107.58s -> 2127.74s]  She's like making me have to go to the bathroom
[2134.55s -> 2136.55s]  I've never seen you look this way before
[2153.37s -> 2162.94s]  Arriving with a big diarrhea coming down. What the fuck are you doing?

[2277.82s -> 2282.22s]  Did you check toilets on the left? Did you check the toilets on the right?
[2282.22s -> 2284.22s]  Did you check the toilet on the right?
[2284.22s -> 2286.22s]  Did you check the toilet on the left?
[2286.22s -> 2288.22s]  Did you check the toilet on the left?
[2288.22s -> 2290.22s]  Did you check the toilet on the left?
[2290.22s -> 2292.22s]  Okay, okay, you win
[2294.97s -> 2296.97s]  Here it is!
[2296.97s -> 2298.97s]  Blast it!
[2298.97s -> 2300.97s]  In the rain or in the snow
[2300.97s -> 2303.28s]  I got the funky, but now
[2303.28s -> 2305.58s]  I really got to go
[2305.58s -> 2307.58s]  In the rain or in the snow
[2307.58s -> 2309.58s]  You got the funk flow, but now you really
[2309.58s -> 2311.58s]  The toilet over there
[2311.58s -> 2313.58s]  Will bring you luck, so give up
[2313.58s -> 2315.58s]  I got no time to spare
[2315.58s -> 2317.58s]  The toilet over there
[2317.58s -> 2319.58s]  Will bring you luck, so give up
[2319.58s -> 2321.58s]  I got no time to spare
[2321.58s -> 2323.58s]  In the rain or in the snow
[2323.58s -> 2325.58s]  I got the funk flow, but now
[2325.58s -> 2327.58s]  I really got to go
[2327.58s -> 2329.58s]  In the rain or in the snow
[2329.58s -> 2331.58s]  You got the funk flow, but now
[2331.58s -> 2333.58s]  You really got it all
[2333.58s -> 2335.58s]  The toilet over there
[2335.58s -> 2337.58s]  Will bring you luck, so give up
[2337.58s -> 2339.58s]  I got no time to spare
[2339.58s -> 2341.76s]  Ah, I'm here losing it
[2341.76s -> 2343.76s]  I'm out of here
[2343.76s -> 2346.25s]  Walk the walk, even if you can't
[2346.25s -> 2348.25s]  Just talk the talk
[2348.25s -> 2350.25s]  I got a call
[2350.25s -> 2352.25s]  I am a chicken from the kitchen
[2352.25s -> 2354.25s]  And I ain't kidding, although nothing is written
[2354.25s -> 2356.25s]  You are a chicken from the kitchen
[2356.25s -> 2358.25s]  And you ain't kidding, nothing is written
[2358.25s -> 2360.25s]  And you and nothing is
[2360.25s -> 2362.25s]  Crack, break, fix the door, you know
[2362.25s -> 2364.25s]  I got to go, so yes, open up, you know
[2364.25s -> 2366.25s]  Crack, crack, break, fix the door, you know
[2366.25s -> 2368.25s]  I got to go, so yes, open up, open
[2368.25s -> 2370.25s]  I got a call
[2370.25s -> 2372.25s]  I am a chicken from the kitchen
[2372.25s -> 2374.25s]  And I ain't kidding, although nothing is written
[2374.25s -> 2376.25s]  You are a chicken from the kitchen
[2376.25s -> 2378.25s]  And you ain't kidding, although nothing is written
[2378.25s -> 2380.25s]  And you and nothing is
[2380.25s -> 2382.25s]  Crack, break, fix the door, you know
[2382.25s -> 2384.25s]  I got to go, so yes, open up, you know
[2384.25s -> 2386.25s]  Crack, crack, break, crack, fix the door
[2386.25s -> 2388.25s]  I got to go, so yes, open up, you know
[2390.25s -> 2392.25s]  It's all yours
[2392.25s -> 2394.25s]  This is life
[2398.56s -> 2403.93s]  Wrap against the toilet
[2405.93s -> 2407.93s]  Sorry to keep you waiting
[2407.93s -> 2410.36s]  I'll drive you home now
[2410.36s -> 2412.36s]  He's the same old Parappa again
[2412.36s -> 2419.85s]  Oh well
[2419.85s -> 2421.85s]  Wrap against the toilet
[2421.85s -> 2423.85s]  How would that make any sense?
[2423.85s -> 2428.84s]  You can't wrap against the toilet
[2428.84s -> 2431.15s]  We're at the end
[2431.15s -> 2433.15s]  But I want to try to get cool on some of these songs
[2433.15s -> 2435.15s]  Then I'm just going to blow through this
[2435.15s -> 2437.15s]  Because then I can freestyle
[2437.15s -> 2441.76s]  I'm going to try the Burger Boy technique
[2441.76s -> 2443.76s]  By the way, I remember when me and Burger Boy were younger
[2443.76s -> 2445.76s]  We played this game
[2445.76s -> 2447.76s]  And I'm going to show you what he did
[2447.76s -> 2449.76s]  I was trying to play the game
[2449.76s -> 2451.76s]  At this level
[2451.76s -> 2453.76s]  And I remember not doing so well
[2453.76s -> 2455.76s]  And I gave him the controller
[2455.76s -> 2457.76s]  And I'm going to show you what he did
[2457.76s -> 2461.08s]  And he got cool instantly
[2461.08s -> 2464.16s]  Show you
[2464.16s -> 2466.16s]  But you can't get cool the first time through
[2466.16s -> 2470.06s]  We can go
[2470.06s -> 2473.52s]  Anywhere
[2473.52s -> 2479.21s]  And then I know
[2479.21s -> 2481.21s]  Oh yes we can fly
[2481.21s -> 2485.44s]  Almost to a special place
[2485.44s -> 2487.44s]  We can find
[2487.44s -> 2489.44s]  Just you and I
[2491.44s -> 2501.36s]  Is it funny? I've never played
[2501.36s -> 2503.79s]  Parappa Rappatube
[2503.79s -> 2505.79s]  Never did it. I don't know why
[2505.79s -> 2509.88s]  I don't think I have
[2509.88s -> 2511.88s]  No, I don't think I have
[2515.85s -> 2518.22s]  That's Dad
[2518.22s -> 2520.22s]  Just how very much
[2520.22s -> 2522.22s]  That I care
[2522.22s -> 2524.22s]  For you
[2524.22s -> 2526.22s]  Everything's fun
[2526.22s -> 2528.52s]  Always worth the see
[2528.52s -> 2530.52s]  It's just you and me
[2530.52s -> 2532.52s]  My friend and me
[2532.52s -> 2535.92s]  You try so hard
[2535.92s -> 2537.92s]  It's good
[2537.92s -> 2543.23s]  And you believe
[2543.23s -> 2548.91s]  This is where we should be
[2548.91s -> 2550.91s]  This is where we should be
[2550.91s -> 2552.91s]  This is where we should be
[2567.63s -> 2569.63s]  This is where we should be
[2571.63s -> 2573.63s]  I'm a Marvel reference
[2573.63s -> 2575.63s]  I have to make three of those a stream
[2575.63s -> 2582.22s]  You can't mind us to a joke you didn't hear
[2582.22s -> 2584.22s]  This is it
[2584.22s -> 2591.44s]  This is it
[2591.44s -> 2594.12s]  I remember this is
[2594.12s -> 2596.12s]  What you're gonna do
[2596.12s -> 2598.12s]  We're gonna put on a show
[2598.12s -> 2601.90s]  Out there for this town
[2601.90s -> 2603.90s]  Somebody say
[2603.90s -> 2607.80s]  Ho ho ho
[2607.80s -> 2609.80s]  Ho ho ho
[2609.80s -> 2611.80s]  What you're gonna do
[2611.80s -> 2625.05s]  What you're gonna do
[2625.05s -> 2628.51s]  When they come
[2628.51s -> 2630.75s]  I gotta be what you're gonna do
[2630.75s -> 2634.46s]  I gotta be what you're gonna do
[2634.46s -> 2636.83s]  When they come
[2636.83s -> 2638.83s]  What you're gonna do
[2638.83s -> 2652.52s]  You gotta do what
[2652.52s -> 2654.52s]  He's running up and down
[2654.52s -> 2656.52s]  Street with the Jews
[2656.52s -> 2658.52s]  Sunny is my life
[2658.52s -> 2660.52s]  She's like a dice
[2660.52s -> 2662.52s]  I can't tell which way she turns
[2662.52s -> 2664.52s]  Till I fight
[2664.52s -> 2667.02s]  Whatever trouble he's in
[2667.02s -> 2669.20s]  He just gets up and begins
[2669.20s -> 2671.20s]  Yeah
[2709.52s -> 2712.56s]  And let's all
[2712.56s -> 2714.56s]  What's the name of the game for me?
[2714.56s -> 2716.56s]  You you you and you
[2730.99s -> 2732.99s]  I can't pay attention
[2741.96s -> 2744.20s]  This is how this is like how you rap with a migrant
[2744.66s -> 2746.28s]  You have a really bad migrant
[2746.28s -> 2748.28s]  You still have to go on stage
[2769.92s -> 2772.60s]  Let's go
[2782.68s -> 2813.02s]  Wait this madness on core on core on core on core on core
[2817.45s -> 2836.32s]  Some of the characters here could really be described as baby's first blender experience
[2836.72s -> 2861.90s]  I did it. I win the game is 30 minutes. Well now I have to get cool on some of these levels
[2863.08s -> 2865.08s]  I'm gonna try the burger boy technique
[2873.68s -> 2876.72s]  Again again. Yeah, i'm gonna do I want to do my favorite levels and try to get cool
[2879.36s -> 2881.78s]  And then crap the wrap the wrap two is right after this
[2894.89s -> 2896.89s]  That's the stream no
[2907.13s -> 2910.43s]  They were really late when they bought the tickets online
[2910.89s -> 2912.89s]  Like three days ago
[2920.36s -> 2927.80s]  PSP wait, hold on a minute. Is this the psp version that they just blew up for the ps4?
[2928.60s -> 2946.36s]  Why aren't these guys trying to make another game? They were gonna do a kickstarter. It didn't work out, right?
[2947.08s -> 2954.76s]  Yeah, it's gonna be like a like project rabbit
[2955.56s -> 2962.24s]  I'm glad i'm that reason but yes. Yeah, that's one but they didn't make enough money
[2963.60s -> 2968.19s]  They got eight percent of what they needed. Well, that's really really really low
[2969.15s -> 2976.38s]  Mighty number nine killed most of these kickstarter games
[2977.90s -> 2981.90s]  What money number nine got like how much did they get like eight million dollars?
[2982.70s -> 2986.54s]  How much money did money number nine get?
[2993.40s -> 2996.49s]  too much
[2996.49s -> 2998.49s]  It was almost four million dollars
[3000.49s -> 3008.67s]  All right
[3008.67s -> 3011.63s]  It's time to do uh, we're gonna play the levels again
[3012.19s -> 3015.95s]  Or not all of them, but maybe some of them. I want to try to get cool on I want to do the burger boy technique
[3017.87s -> 3035.26s]  What are you talking about?
[3035.26s -> 3041.47s]  All right menu stage select
[3042.83s -> 3044.83s]  I'm gonna do the burger boy technique. Are you ready?
[3046.54s -> 3052.86s]  This is I handed him the controller and this is what he did. I'm gonna do everything verbatim exactly
[3052.86s -> 3054.86s]  I remember it like it was yesterday
[3054.94s -> 3076.94s]  The secret trick let's see if it works
[3077.10s -> 3079.98s]  This is not me making a joke. By the way, this is really what happened
[3098.33s -> 3100.89s]  Let's see if it works
[3101.77s -> 3110.41s]  I got
[3138.56s -> 3140.56s]  Almost worked in the beginning
[3141.60s -> 3145.48s]  Is that
[3173.31s -> 3175.31s]  Now take it away
[3176.99s -> 3179.63s]  My
[3254.89s -> 3257.20s]  For me
[3276.94s -> 3278.94s]  I should have done that at the beginning
[3279.10s -> 3284.22s]  For you you you you you you you you you you you you you for the whole song
[3285.42s -> 3295.00s]  I gotta pee I gotta pee
[3298.14s -> 3300.14s]  All right, let's try another one
[3300.38s -> 3301.74s]  everybody
[3301.74s -> 3304.92s]  Don't you you have to remember the burger boy technique?
[3307.84s -> 3309.02s]  works
[3309.02s -> 3310.88s]  sometimes
[3310.88s -> 3319.32s]  A broken clock is right twice a day. I know
[3319.96s -> 3330.94s]  But that's still the clock is still correct. Sometimes when you you know what I mean? It's still correct. All right
[3330.94s -> 3332.94s]  What's what do I want to do?
[3333.02s -> 3336.94s]  Let's do the cooking one. I'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna destroy this one. We're gonna burn boy technique this one
[3338.86s -> 3343.42s]  But it's only correct for a minute and that was probably a minute long that's how long that needed to be right
[3354.96s -> 3359.44s]  Every single day stress comes in every way. I ain't got no time for nobody
[3359.52s -> 3362.48s]  See my style is rich. All right, let's let's blow this out of the water here
[3363.44s -> 3369.05s]  That looks rich crack crack crack the egg into the bowl crack into the bowl
[3369.37s -> 3371.55s]  M i x the flour into the bowl

[4908.79s -> 4909.79s]  Why?
[4910.79s -> 4912.79s]  So, ah, last one
[4921.43s -> 4923.43s]  It's never gonna make it

[4926.43s -> 4929.43s]  Bugged up, bugged ass level
[4931.43s -> 4935.23s]  No, start it over
[4947.94s -> 4952.95s]  My god, it's so off beat when you do it the wrong right way
[4952.95s -> 4959.63s]  Oh my god

[4971.70s -> 4974.00s]  It's the, the song sucks
[4974.00s -> 4976.00s]  It's so distracting
[4985.04s -> 4987.18s]  Just fail
[4991.58s -> 4997.81s]  Fuck that song
[4998.81s -> 5001.84s]  What does feel the beat?
[5002.84s -> 5004.66s]  See the beat
[5005.66s -> 5008.34s]  You tell me I could've done 16 by 9?
[5009.34s -> 5011.34s]  Oh, no, it's already on 16 by 9
[5013.34s -> 5016.48s]  Alright, let's do Parappa the Rapper 2
[5017.48s -> 5022.48s]  The fucking chicken level just tilted me to a point where I wanted to do the other one
[5024.48s -> 5026.48s]  Big bitch just came in right now, hold on
[5027.48s -> 5034.48s]  To Parappa the Rapper 2
[5035.48s -> 5038.62s]  Click the touch pad to use the selected
[5038.62s -> 5040.62s]  Oh, it's cause this is not a remaster
[5040.62s -> 5042.05s]  Right
[5042.05s -> 5044.05s]  This is just a full on
[5045.35s -> 5046.35s]  They just ported it
[5046.35s -> 5048.42s]  I think
[5048.42s -> 5050.50s]  I think
[5050.50s -> 5056.74s]  But somebody just gave, that was Ishanji for the 5000 bits
[5058.49s -> 5060.49s]  50 bucks from Ishanji, thank you so much
[5061.49s -> 5064.49s]  They say cool on cheap cheap level or riot
[5064.49s -> 5066.49s]  Only hit extra buttons on the beat
[5066.49s -> 5067.49s]  Look at where the dots are
[5067.49s -> 5069.49s]  It's usually easiest to do at the end of the lines with this extra
[5069.49s -> 5070.49s]  Oh, fuck that song
[5073.56s -> 5074.56s]  Oh, this is loud
[5078.46s -> 5079.46s]  Much louder than the last one
[5080.46s -> 5086.89s]  But thank you Ishanji
[5086.89s -> 5088.89s]  I'll get cool on some of these
[5089.89s -> 5090.89s]  Ow

[5093.34s -> 5094.34s]  Loud
[5094.34s -> 5096.29s]  Oh
[5096.29s -> 5098.29s]  I gotta turn this down on my end
[5104.70s -> 5105.70s]  What the hell is going on?
[5106.70s -> 5114.70s]  Alright, Parappa the Rapper 2
[5132.52s -> 5134.89s]  First I liked it
[5134.89s -> 5135.89s]  But now
[5135.89s -> 5136.89s]  Donut?
[5136.89s -> 5137.89s]  I don't even wanna look at it
[5137.89s -> 5141.86s]  The only thing that gets me going
[5141.86s -> 5143.86s]  Is the lovely Sunny Funny
[5143.86s -> 5144.86s]  And her sweet smile
[5144.86s -> 5146.86s]  Her name is Sunny Funny?
[5146.86s -> 5147.86s]  I'll do anything for her
[5147.86s -> 5149.86s]  I didn't even know that's what her name was
[5150.86s -> 5162.14s]  Believe
[5162.14s -> 5165.48s]  I can't believe
[5165.48s -> 5168.06s]  You were such a baby
[5168.06s -> 5169.06s]  Hey
[5169.06s -> 5175.17s]  Little did I know
[5175.17s -> 5178.17s]  This was the beginning of a long
[5178.17s -> 5184.22s]  I actually don't know what the hell happened there
[5185.53s -> 5199.42s]  Parappa the Rapper
[5199.42s -> 5208.12s]  Parappa the Rapper
[5208.12s -> 5209.12s]  2002
[5210.12s -> 5211.12s]  Was this on PlayStation 1?
[5212.12s -> 5213.12s]  Oh, PS2
[5213.12s -> 5214.12s]  I don't remember
[5214.12s -> 5215.42s]  I think it was PS1
[5216.42s -> 5217.42s]  Alright
[5217.42s -> 5223.98s]  City Hall
[5223.98s -> 5224.98s]  Load and save
[5225.98s -> 5227.79s]  Or
[5227.79s -> 5228.79s]  Stage 1
[5228.79s -> 5229.79s]  Stage 1
[5229.79s -> 5230.97s]  Single play
[5231.97s -> 5233.14s]  That's what we're doing
[5233.14s -> 5241.44s]  Little 17 year old Jeremy
[5241.44s -> 5242.44s]  I don't
[5242.44s -> 5243.44s]  No, I didn't play this one
[5243.44s -> 5244.44s]  Beard Burgers
[5244.44s -> 5248.47s]  A Parappa Town tradition
[5276.91s -> 5277.91s]  No noodles
[5277.91s -> 5278.91s]  No noodles
[5281.91s -> 5282.91s]  Beard Burgers
[5282.91s -> 5284.91s]  A Parappa Town tradition
[5297.99s -> 5298.99s]  Don't do it
[5298.99s -> 5327.37s]  I know how to do this
[5327.37s -> 5347.66s]  When can I stop this?
[5349.28s -> 5360.66s]  How do I get out of here?
[5360.66s -> 5361.66s]  How do I leave?
[5361.66s -> 5363.73s]  Holy shit
[5363.73s -> 5364.73s]  You have to restart
[5366.22s -> 5367.22s]  Don't freestyle
[5367.22s -> 5368.22s]  I can't help it
[5369.22s -> 5370.40s]  I have to
[5370.40s -> 5371.40s]  You know what I want
[5371.40s -> 5373.70s]  A traditional beard burger
[5373.70s -> 5374.70s]  Me too
[5374.70s -> 5375.70s]  And I want 10 of them
[5376.70s -> 5379.99s]  Noodles again?
[5379.99s -> 5380.99s]  What?
[5380.99s -> 5382.49s]  Traditional burgers
[5383.49s -> 5384.86s]  We're terribly sorry
[5384.86s -> 5385.86s]  For some reason
[5385.86s -> 5388.86s]  All our burgers turned into noodles
[5388.86s -> 5389.86s]  It's really not that bad though
[5389.86s -> 5390.86s]  You should try it
[5390.86s -> 5391.86s]  That's not the point
[5391.86s -> 5393.86s]  I want a hamburger
[5393.86s -> 5394.86s]  I see
[5394.86s -> 5395.86s]  Well, sorry
[5395.86s -> 5397.86s]  But we don't have any right now
[5397.86s -> 5399.86s]  If only our president were alive
[5399.86s -> 5400.86s]  Yeah
[5400.86s -> 5402.86s]  We can't have no baby run in the store
[5402.86s -> 5403.86s]  Baby run in the store
[5403.86s -> 5404.86s]  Baby run in the store
[5404.86s -> 5406.86s]  I appreciate the freestyle there
[5406.86s -> 5407.86s]  Baby?
[5407.86s -> 5410.38s]  Baby?
[5410.38s -> 5411.38s]  You're telling me to stop freestyling
[5411.38s -> 5412.38s]  When the people in the game
[5412.38s -> 5413.38s]  And the cut scenes are doing it too
[5413.38s -> 5414.38s]  I have a name with a real man
[5414.38s -> 5415.38s]  You babies can stay home
[5415.38s -> 5417.38s]  And play with your toys
[5417.38s -> 5428.51s]  I'm going to grow up
[5428.51s -> 5430.51s]  Still a bunch of babies
[5430.51s -> 5433.51s]  I put my whole life into opening this store
[5433.51s -> 5434.51s]  And look what happens
[5434.51s -> 5436.51s]  The moment my son takes charge
[5436.51s -> 5437.51s]  Here
[5437.51s -> 5438.51s]  Let me show you
[5438.51s -> 5440.51s]  How to make a real Parappa Town
[5440.51s -> 5442.51s]  Traditional burger
[5442.51s -> 5443.51s]  Watch
[5443.51s -> 5444.51s]  Listen
[5444.51s -> 5445.51s]  Learn
[5445.51s -> 5447.51s]  And play exactly as I do
[5447.51s -> 5448.51s]  Really?
[5449.51s -> 5450.51s]  Yeah
[5450.51s -> 5451.51s]  I know
[5451.51s -> 5452.51s]  I gotta believe
[5454.39s -> 5458.90s]  Alright
[5458.90s -> 5459.90s]  No freestyling
[5460.90s -> 5462.90s]  That's like saying a fish shouldn't swim
[5462.90s -> 5463.90s]  Come on
[5463.90s -> 5464.90s]  Give me a break
[5464.90s -> 5465.90s]  Ooh
[5465.90s -> 5466.90s]  Ooh
[5471.46s -> 5472.46s]  Ooh
[5485.98s -> 5486.98s]  Meat
[5486.98s -> 5487.98s]  Meat
[5487.98s -> 5488.98s]  And toast
[5488.98s -> 5489.98s]  Toast
[5489.98s -> 5490.98s]  Toast
[5490.98s -> 5493.05s]  You got to
[5493.05s -> 5497.17s]  You know how to
[5497.17s -> 5501.42s]  Eat
[5502.42s -> 5505.83s]  I wanna do
[5505.83s -> 5506.83s]  I have to freestyle
[5507.83s -> 5508.83s]  Toast
[5508.83s -> 5511.54s]  That was plus 52
[5511.54s -> 5512.54s]  Cut
[5512.54s -> 5516.15s]  Is a shake or a friend
[5516.15s -> 5517.15s]  If you're hungry
[5517.15s -> 5518.15s]  Simply line up at the end
[5518.15s -> 5519.15s]  Come on people
[5519.15s -> 5520.15s]  Gather round
[5520.15s -> 5521.15s]  We got everything you want
[5521.15s -> 5522.15s]  From all around
[5522.15s -> 5523.78s]  To lettuce
[5524.78s -> 5525.78s]  Cut
[5525.78s -> 5526.78s]  To lettuce
[5526.78s -> 5527.78s]  You got to
[5527.78s -> 5528.78s]  Heat
[5528.78s -> 5529.78s]  To grill
[5529.78s -> 5530.78s]  Heat

[5536.78s -> 5537.78s]  Cook
[5537.78s -> 5538.78s]  The bun

[5539.78s -> 5540.78s]  It's Spongebob
[5540.78s -> 5547.52s]  Cook the patty
[5547.52s -> 5550.74s]  Is out
[5550.74s -> 5551.74s]  Cook the fries
[5551.74s -> 5552.74s]  What is that
[5552.74s -> 5559.87s]  French the fries
[5559.87s -> 5560.87s]  The mustard
[5560.87s -> 5561.87s]  The salt
[5561.87s -> 5562.87s]  And the pepper
[5562.87s -> 5563.87s]  Put it on
[5563.87s -> 5564.87s]  Right guys
[5564.87s -> 5565.87s]  We got no extra
[5565.87s -> 5566.87s]  You watch the grill
[5566.87s -> 5567.87s]  Control the flame
[5567.87s -> 5568.87s]  Guys
[5568.87s -> 5569.87s]  Follow the rules
[5569.87s -> 5570.87s]  Think of the fries
[5570.87s -> 5573.14s]  And cook those burgers
[5573.14s -> 5574.14s]  Cook those burgers
[5574.14s -> 5577.68s]  Watch them fries

[5581.68s -> 5582.68s]  It sounds like Spongebob
[5582.68s -> 5583.68s]  Better execute
[5583.68s -> 5586.52s]  To the ketchup
[5586.52s -> 5588.53s]  It's spongebob
[5588.53s -> 5589.53s]  Don't forget the cheese
[5589.53s -> 5590.70s]  Bring the mustard
[5590.70s -> 5591.70s]  Bring on the mustard
[5591.70s -> 5592.70s]  And the liquid cheese
[5592.70s -> 5593.70s]  And the liquid cheese
[5593.70s -> 5594.70s]  Burgers
[5594.70s -> 5596.46s]  I'll be having mine
[5596.46s -> 5597.46s]  It cooks the best
[5597.46s -> 5598.46s]  You better get in line
[5598.46s -> 5599.46s]  Now put it on the tray
[5599.46s -> 5600.46s]  Is it for you to go?
[5600.46s -> 5601.46s]  Any which way it tastes good
[5601.46s -> 5602.46s]  You know
[5602.46s -> 5603.46s]  Cook those burgers
[5603.46s -> 5604.46s]  Don't forget the cheese

[5619.46s -> 5620.46s]  Three
[5620.46s -> 5622.85s]  The ketchup
[5622.85s -> 5623.85s]  Yeah
[5623.85s -> 5624.85s]  That's what I'm talking about
[5624.85s -> 5625.85s]  And it's Mr. Krabs
[5625.85s -> 5626.85s]  And I'm going to cook those burgers right now
[5626.85s -> 5627.85s]  All right
[5627.85s -> 5628.85s]  I'm off to a good start
[5628.85s -> 5629.85s]  That was a fun one
[5629.85s -> 5630.85s]  I like that one
[5630.85s -> 5631.85s]  Turn the patio
[5631.85s -> 5633.15s]  Turn the patio
[5633.15s -> 5634.15s]  Okay, save system file
[5634.15s -> 5635.15s]  Checking slot one
[5635.15s -> 5644.58s]  Oh it's just virtual machine
[5644.58s -> 5645.58s]  I get it
[5645.58s -> 5646.58s]  It seems pretty accurate
[5646.58s -> 5647.58s]  Saving system file
[5647.58s -> 5649.53s]  Oh it's just virtual machine
[5649.53s -> 5650.53s]  I get it
[5650.53s -> 5653.62s]  It seems pretty accurate

[5659.62s -> 5663.10s]  It's getting timed up
[5663.10s -> 5666.01s]  We're doing a bit off
[5666.01s -> 5674.93s]  Yeah well you can't
[5674.93s -> 5675.93s]  You can't say it
[5675.93s -> 5676.93s]  This is where the phenomenon known as noodleization is taking place
[5676.93s -> 5677.93s]  All the food being served in this town is turning into noodles
[5677.93s -> 5678.93s]  Even ice cream?
[5678.93s -> 5679.93s]  Whoa
[5679.93s -> 5680.93s]  Hey
[5680.93s -> 5688.70s]  I can't eat this
[5688.70s -> 5689.70s]  We have to stop this noodling thing
[5689.70s -> 5690.70s]  Maybe I do
[5690.70s -> 5691.70s]  Oh
[5691.70s -> 5692.70s]  Oh
[5692.70s -> 5693.70s]  Oh

[9460.62s -> 9464.99s]  I was trying to string together a sentence I couldn't I don't know what the hell was going on
[9464.99s -> 9469.30s]  and so that's the end of this funny adventure
[9469.30s -> 9474.05s]  peace is back in forappetown

[9494.67s -> 9499.04s]  I can eat anything now anything but cheese
[9499.04s -> 9503.04s]  I want another lifetime to buy
[9503.04s -> 9508.35s]  cheese sounds pretty great actually
[9508.35s -> 9524.10s]  just shaking
[9524.10s -> 9542.61s]  yeah this does sound like when you put like a song into
[9542.61s -> 9554.91s]  G minor it just sounds evil that cheese to melt
[9554.91s -> 9575.84s]  G major is the evil one yeah that's what it does
[9575.84s -> 9597.68s]  cheese pizza ending how is this a bad ending
[9597.68s -> 9602.37s]  that is actually kind of gross
[9602.37s -> 9613.76s]  it's gross it's in the shape of
[9613.76s -> 9633.79s]  forappa the wrapper
[9633.79s -> 9637.79s]  forappa the wrapper two okay now
[9637.79s -> 9643.06s]  is there any bonus stuff before we move on to the thing
[9643.06s -> 9652.85s]  I kind of want to see if there's any bonus material
[9652.85s -> 9659.84s]  I'll play three well that's technically um jama-lammy but um jama-lammy is technically two
[9659.84s -> 9663.84s]  so we played it out of order it goes in the
[9663.84s -> 9667.84s]  canon it's forappa the wrapper one um jama-lammy
[9667.84s -> 9673.60s]  we played um jama-lammy already so this is technically three
[9673.60s -> 9681.34s]  checking slot one are you sure you want to
[9681.34s -> 9685.34s]  overwrite saving now save complete
[9685.34s -> 9689.52s]  I'm surprised they didn't do a third game
[9689.52s -> 9693.52s]  even like 2002 nothing after that you would think they would kind of round it
[9693.52s -> 9700.93s]  up with a trilogy all right what we got I can do
[9700.93s -> 9706.94s]  what stage do I want to do this one I like this one this is okay

[10773.62s -> 10775.62s]  Burgers

[10995.14s -> 10997.14s]  Do I have to be like
[11002.70s -> 11012.21s]  You're getting dog hair on the burgers
[11013.29s -> 11033.90s]  All right, that's it. That was per appa. I feel like I want to do like one more. All right
[11033.90s -> 11035.62s]  I'm just gonna fuck this whole thing up
[11035.62s -> 11045.79s]  Do two player. I
[11045.99s -> 11047.99s]  can't
[11049.06s -> 11051.06s]  One controller
[11063.50s -> 11066.06s]  I'm just going for this one. I'm just gonna fuck this whole thing up
[11068.18s -> 11073.35s]  I'm just gonna go just try to do as many fucked up freestyles as I can
[11095.56s -> 11098.36s]  No matter what the deal I crave for this
[11125.56s -> 11127.56s]  Or Jamaica

[11255.56s -> 11257.56s]  Welcome
[11265.72s -> 11271.34s]  You're right for some noodle sushi do it again, I can't
[11281.95s -> 11293.71s]  All right last time you got one cool this whole playthrough that's not true. I didn't like three or four times we talking about
[11293.71s -> 11297.78s]  I don't know on like three or four of the stages
[11346.53s -> 11348.53s]  You can get it in the first two bars
[11355.09s -> 11357.81s]  Comes my direct actions as my followers
[11375.81s -> 11377.81s]  I
[11399.58s -> 11401.58s]  Don't get it in the next like four bars
[11402.02s -> 11411.29s]  Yeah
[11422.42s -> 11430.06s]  It's just so all over the place and you see what I did there, how the fuck did I get any points for that?
[11430.06s -> 11446.32s]  Come on
[11475.74s -> 11478.36s]  That shouldn't have actually that should have been zero
[11502.19s -> 11504.19s]  You understand that the man
[11507.00s -> 11509.00s]  And that one was zero
[11518.92s -> 11520.92s]  I'm not doing it again
[11526.51s -> 11545.39s]  That was a nice trip down memory lane for after the rapper do l on every half beat
[11547.58s -> 11552.19s]  Yeah, somebody else to figure it out. All right, i'm gonna take a quick break. I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna play the thing
[11552.83s -> 11558.40s]  You have one cool in this game the rest were in the first it's not true
[11559.36s -> 11562.56s]  Now that's completely made up. That's complete fabrication
[11564.49s -> 11566.49s]  I got cool on at least three of these levels
[11567.53s -> 11577.15s]  That's the total fabrication
