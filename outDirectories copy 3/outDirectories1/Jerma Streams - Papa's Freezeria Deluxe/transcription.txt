[64.38s -> 76.33s]  What's up? How's it going?
[76.33s -> 80.30s]  What's happening?
[80.30s -> 82.77s]  No fucking way.
[82.77s -> 87.42s]  What do you mean? Like no way that I'm here?
[87.42s -> 90.02s]  No way. No way.
[90.02s -> 94.17s]  What? What's going on here?
[94.17s -> 99.03s]  Are you that shocked that I'm streaming?
[99.03s -> 100.59s]  I can't believe this dude's actually streaming.
[100.59s -> 101.63s]  What the fuck?
[101.63s -> 106.74s]  Who the heck has he been?
[106.74s -> 114.95s]  All right, let me tweet this in one sec.
[114.95s -> 118.62s]  There we go.
[118.62s -> 124.60s]  My Twitter analytics must be absolute dogshit.
[124.60s -> 128.32s]  All of my tweets are either sponsored tweets or they're go live tweets.
[128.36s -> 130.28s]  And then sometimes, like once a year,
[130.28s -> 133.60s]  I'll have a tweet that has like five million views
[133.60s -> 136.32s]  and everything else is just way, way, way under that.
[136.32s -> 139.88s]  My analytics must be awful.
[139.88s -> 146.65s]  Must be like the shittiest analytics of any Twitter account.
[146.65s -> 152.23s]  Whatever. Who cares?
[152.23s -> 154.43s]  Did you tweet something funny?
[154.43s -> 159.58s]  That's, I guess, up to you.
[159.58s -> 162.74s]  Oh, I did have a fake Mario movie tweet that is...
[162.74s -> 165.37s]  I could read a draft or two. Why not?
[165.37s -> 170.14s]  Let's see what this one is.
[170.14s -> 179.60s]  Did I tell... Did I talk about this one?
[179.60s -> 180.48s]  All right, I'll read it.
[180.52s -> 185.61s]  Well, should I wait till people come in?
[185.61s -> 193.62s]  I actually like this one.
[193.62s -> 195.38s]  Chat faked an entire stream.
[195.38s -> 203.57s]  Yeah, I heard about that.
[203.57s -> 205.19s]  We'll get a chill.
[205.19s -> 206.03s]  Yeah, we're going to play...
[206.03s -> 207.03s]  All right, here's the plan.
[207.03s -> 209.23s]  I want to go over the weekend.
[209.23s -> 214.63s]  Yes, the plan is to be live today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
[214.63s -> 218.69s]  Today, we're going to play Papa's Freezeria.
[218.69s -> 220.05s]  Was it Freezeria?
[220.05s -> 221.05s]  Freezeria.
[221.05s -> 222.17s]  What the fuck?
[222.17s -> 224.17s]  I'm just realizing right now.
[224.17s -> 226.23s]  It's Freezeria.
[226.23s -> 228.11s]  Freezeria is what I thought it was.
[228.11s -> 230.39s]  For five, ten years.
[230.39s -> 235.15s]  Ten years ago, I called it Freezeria.
[235.15s -> 236.43s]  Why would I do that?
[236.43s -> 238.03s]  I'm just... Why?
[238.03s -> 238.87s]  That's weird.
[245.46s -> 247.94s]  Anyways, you can't read?
[247.94s -> 249.64s]  I can read.
[249.64s -> 255.74s]  Freezeria isn't a word.
[255.74s -> 257.74s]  Oh, wait, if you look up Freezeria in the dictionary,
[257.74s -> 258.94s]  is Papa's face there?
[258.94s -> 267.43s]  Is it better me?
[267.43s -> 268.75s]  All right, anyways, we're going to play this today.
[268.75s -> 271.03s]  We have Papa's Freezeria.
[271.03s -> 273.75s]  This is the deluxe version.
[273.75s -> 276.43s]  The deluxe version is on Steam now, apparently.
[277.15s -> 278.79s]  I don't know what that means.
[278.79s -> 281.13s]  I'm just going to chill and play it.
[281.13s -> 282.53s]  Tomorrow, we might play something else.
[282.53s -> 287.27s]  It depends on how long this one goes for.
[287.27s -> 291.61s]  Also, tomorrow, the plan is to do 90s ads.
[291.61s -> 294.17s]  Watch some old 90s ads.
[294.17s -> 296.48s]  It'll be fun.
[296.48s -> 301.48s]  And then Sunday, I want to do the House Flipper Farm DLC.
[304.58s -> 310.02s]  Looks like a pretty extensive update to that game.
[310.02s -> 312.67s]  But there's your weekend plan.
[312.67s -> 314.47s]  I think you can build your own house now
[314.47s -> 315.67s]  in House Flipper, right?
[319.43s -> 322.62s]  It looks like you can build a whole house from scratch.
[322.62s -> 323.46s]  I don't know why I made that sound
[323.46s -> 329.60s]  like it was a chocolate pudding recipe.
[329.60s -> 331.44s]  All right, anyways, let's read this tweet,
[331.44s -> 334.05s]  this giraffe-ed tweet.
[334.05s -> 335.33s]  By the way, I want to make it really clear.
[335.33s -> 336.89s]  I have not seen the Mario movie,
[336.89s -> 339.33s]  so I don't even, we're just going to read this.
[339.33s -> 342.15s]  I've not seen the Mario movie.
[342.15s -> 343.55s]  I just watched the Mario movie
[343.55s -> 347.03s]  and was getting really fidgety and visibly annoyed.
[347.03s -> 351.84s]  They took way too long for the first Yahoo.
[351.84s -> 361.22s]  It was all right.
[361.22s -> 365.82s]  Is it great? Send it.
[365.86s -> 367.22s]  I'm just imagining somebody sitting there
[367.22s -> 369.18s]  just fucking pissed, like fidgeting around,
[369.18s -> 371.10s]  like, where is it?
[371.10s -> 371.94s]  Come on.
[372.94s -> 375.01s]  Fucking God damn it.
[375.01s -> 376.57s]  And Holly said something funny.
[376.57s -> 378.77s]  She's like, we haven't seen this movie.
[378.77s -> 383.77s]  What if Mario does a Yahoo in the first like 10 seconds?
[383.81s -> 388.42s]  Like, wow, that really sounds fucked up, doesn't it?
[388.42s -> 391.18s]  Does it happen in the first 10 seconds?
[391.18s -> 394.88s]  Oh, they took way too long for the first Yahoo.
[394.88s -> 397.12s]  And if it happens in the first five minutes of the movie,
[397.36s -> 398.20s]  I don't know.
[398.20s -> 403.04s]  I thought that made it funnier.
[403.04s -> 406.59s]  He literally does.
[406.59s -> 410.88s]  He Yahoo's really quickly.
[410.88s -> 416.20s]  But that's the only reason he went to go to see the movie.
[417.83s -> 420.15s]  It's his first word in the movie?
[422.90s -> 427.10s]  Who cares?
[427.10s -> 429.86s]  It's literally the first word in the movie
[429.86s -> 432.37s]  and it's in the trailer.
[432.37s -> 436.55s]  Oh, they took way too fucking long for the first Yahoo.
[436.55s -> 444.64s]  I was fidgeting and annoyed in my seat.
[444.64s -> 446.36s]  All right.
[446.36s -> 450.82s]  Well, that's, there it is.
[450.86s -> 453.07s]  This movie is fired though.
[453.07s -> 454.67s]  Oh, we're definitely gonna see it.
[454.67s -> 462.21s]  Need to find some time to see it.
[462.21s -> 463.22s]  Okay.
[463.22s -> 467.55s]  So we're gonna play Papa's Freez-Area.
[467.55s -> 471.31s]  I'm a, I don't wanna say I'm a huge fan of the Papa games.
[471.31s -> 475.73s]  I've played them a few times.
[475.73s -> 477.09s]  Relax.
[477.09s -> 478.61s]  Pull up a chair.
[478.61s -> 481.86s]  If you're already sitting, then good.
[481.86s -> 486.90s]  I guess if you're already sitting down.
[486.90s -> 488.70s]  I actually don't even know how you play these.
[488.70s -> 492.17s]  They're kind of like Diner Dash, right?
[492.17s -> 493.01s]  They operate similarly.
[493.01s -> 495.41s]  If they like serve customers and they get mad
[495.41s -> 497.78s]  if you take too long, right?
[497.78s -> 499.76s]  No.
[499.76s -> 500.92s]  Oh, wait.
[500.92s -> 505.18s]  Oh, that is how it is, isn't it?
[505.18s -> 506.02s]  Okay.
[506.02s -> 510.30s]  Well, let's go.
[510.30s -> 514.14s]  Here is Papa's Freez-Area.
[514.14s -> 514.98s]  Hey, there we go.
[514.98s -> 517.06s]  Okay.
[517.06s -> 517.98s]  Let's get started.
[519.98s -> 522.58s]  We'll do this one.
[522.58s -> 523.78s]  Create a custom worker.
[523.78s -> 528.58s]  I mean, we kind of have to do that, don't we?
[528.58s -> 530.52s]  Custom worker?
[530.52s -> 531.96s]  Yeah, this is, this is deluxe.
[531.96s -> 537.58s]  I don't know what the deluxe means.
[537.58s -> 541.73s]  Okay.
[541.73s -> 547.69s]  Wait, you can change the position of your head?
[547.69s -> 549.51s]  Okay.
[549.51s -> 557.42s]  I can't, I'm all right with this.
[557.42s -> 566.81s]  You can do gamer neck or normal.
[566.81s -> 570.50s]  Oh, this is actually a lot.
[570.50s -> 574.23s]  How are there more hair options in Papa's Freez-Area
[574.23s -> 578.39s]  than half of the AAA games I've ever played?
[578.39s -> 585.64s]  Doesn't that kind of make you a little annoyed?
[585.64s -> 590.17s]  And I'm talking way more.
[590.17s -> 592.99s]  Okay, how about that?
[592.99s -> 601.54s]  Is there hair color?
[601.54s -> 602.86s]  It's 2D.
[602.86s -> 605.94s]  It's 2D.
[605.94s -> 609.46s]  Yeah.
[609.46s -> 614.80s]  Yeah, that's true.
[614.80s -> 618.10s]  Let's be fair.
[618.10s -> 624.23s]  We're definitely, we're going with the mustache 100%.
[624.23s -> 629.62s]  I could, hold on.
[629.62s -> 630.62s]  Where's Bald?
[630.62s -> 643.56s]  I kind of want to make the Pringles guy.
[643.56s -> 653.61s]  What does the Pringles guy look like?
[653.61s -> 658.83s]  What does the Pringles guy look like?
[658.83s -> 664.18s]  Can I change the eyes?
[664.18s -> 666.60s]  Okay.
[666.60s -> 667.44s]  What does the Pringles,
[667.44s -> 669.15s]  the Pringles guy doesn't really have a mouth.
[669.15s -> 670.97s]  No, it's not like that.
[670.97s -> 680.37s]  The mustache covers the mouth.
[680.37s -> 681.93s]  The Pringles guy has hair.
[681.93s -> 682.77s]  He does?
[682.77s -> 688.55s]  Oh shit, he does.
[688.55s -> 689.91s]  He does have hair.
[689.91s -> 690.95s]  He has hair.
[690.95s -> 693.83s]  Why do I think he doesn't have hair?
[693.83s -> 694.79s]  I'm telling you right now,
[694.79s -> 697.91s]  the Pringles guy just did not have hair until right now.
[697.91s -> 704.35s]  Until you just all said it.
[704.35s -> 707.07s]  It's a middle part, isn't it?
[707.07s -> 717.89s]  It's like this, right?
[717.89s -> 718.89s]  Oh, let me look this up.
[718.89s -> 720.75s]  Pringles guy.
[721.07s -> 722.15s]  Pringles guy.
[722.15s -> 726.40s]  What does he look like?
[726.40s -> 729.45s]  He does have hair.
[729.45s -> 731.53s]  I'm thinking of the Monopoly man.
[731.53s -> 734.93s]  The Monopoly man has the mustache and is bald.
[734.93s -> 739.30s]  The Pringles guy has a middle part and a mustache.
[739.30s -> 742.81s]  Okay.
[742.81s -> 745.00s]  Well, now I know.
[745.00s -> 748.98s]  It's kind of this mustache as well.
[748.98s -> 750.34s]  Monopoly man has a top hat.
[750.34s -> 761.78s]  Yeah, he's still bald.
[761.78s -> 767.02s]  That looks pretty good.
[767.02s -> 767.86s]  This looks good.
[767.86s -> 774.26s]  I think this is fine.
[774.26s -> 775.22s]  Ooh, eyebrows.
[775.22s -> 778.12s]  Wait, should we get rid of the hair
[778.12s -> 780.61s]  and just do eyebrows for hair?
[780.61s -> 782.64s]  Kind of like that, isn't it?
[782.64s -> 787.09s]  Ah, that's too much work.
[787.09s -> 788.41s]  I don't think the eyebrows can be big enough
[788.41s -> 792.26s]  for that to make sense.
[792.26s -> 793.26s]  What's the biggest eyebrows?
[793.26s -> 797.37s]  These ones?
[797.37s -> 814.00s]  I can't make these bigger.
[814.00s -> 816.06s]  No brows.
[816.06s -> 821.39s]  He has no eyebrows.
[821.39s -> 825.26s]  All right, what was it?
[825.26s -> 833.30s]  It's the middle part or is it right here somewhere?
[833.30s -> 844.91s]  Should we get, no eyebrows he's saying?
[844.91s -> 847.14s]  Okay, I think that's good.
[847.14s -> 853.05s]  What about glasses?
[853.05s -> 859.22s]  This feels like they updated the Pringles guy, right?
[859.22s -> 860.26s]  Doesn't it feel like, oh yeah, no, no,
[860.26s -> 861.50s]  we took the Pringles guy.
[861.50s -> 865.96s]  We wanted to update his look a little.
[865.96s -> 875.38s]  I don't like the updated Pringles guy.
[875.38s -> 878.06s]  Hey, we gave the Pringles guy glasses.
[878.06s -> 884.26s]  Oh, okay.
[884.26s -> 891.56s]  Hipster.
[891.56s -> 900.13s]  I'm gonna keep it like this.
[900.13s -> 901.33s]  What do you mean no?
[902.77s -> 904.49s]  Hey guys, is that, my character's done.
[904.49s -> 905.61s]  No, it's not.
[905.61s -> 906.89s]  Yeah, it is, it's done.
[906.89s -> 911.31s]  I'm done, my character's done.
[911.31s -> 914.52s]  I'm keeping it like this.
[917.04s -> 925.51s]  I love the no.
[925.51s -> 926.43s]  All right, your chef's name.
[926.43s -> 929.39s]  What's my chef's name?
[929.39s -> 931.50s]  I don't know.
[931.50s -> 933.06s]  Oh, is the window too small?
[933.06s -> 934.62s]  No, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[934.62s -> 938.66s]  Oh, wait.
[938.66s -> 942.84s]  Oh, shit, wait.
[942.84s -> 944.00s]  There we go, okay.
[944.00s -> 948.60s]  Name.
[948.60s -> 961.13s]  How about just, Peter Pringle.
[961.13s -> 962.82s]  Melvin?
[962.82s -> 965.34s]  I like Melvin.
[965.34s -> 966.46s]  Melvin's kinda nice.
[966.46s -> 969.19s]  Yeah, I'll do Melvin.
[969.19s -> 970.72s]  Just Melvin.
[970.72s -> 972.96s]  All right, Melvin.
[972.96s -> 975.38s]  I'm ready.
[975.38s -> 977.55s]  Melvin's new job.
[977.55s -> 980.76s]  Let's go.
[980.76s -> 983.98s]  Worker's guide.
[983.98s -> 985.18s]  Calypso Island population.
[985.18s -> 991.41s]  Isn't there like 12 people that live here?
[991.41s -> 995.97s]  12 people on this whole island?
[997.42s -> 998.46s]  All right, hold on.
[998.46s -> 1000.30s]  I was trying to make Papa.
[1000.30s -> 1004.06s]  Why have I combined every one of these characters?
[1004.06s -> 1005.14s]  I just look like a dickhead.
[1005.14s -> 1010.12s]  I look like I'm showing up to work pretending to be him.
[1010.12s -> 1013.66s]  I was trying to make him the whole time.
[1013.66s -> 1019.64s]  All right.
[1020.32s -> 1026.40s]  He really does look like the Pringles guy.
[1026.40s -> 1030.69s]  He can look like that, but I can't.
[1030.69s -> 1033.42s]  Okay, day one.
[1033.42s -> 1035.34s]  Welcome to Papa's Freezeria.
[1035.34s -> 1039.27s]  Let's get started with training, okay.
[1039.27s -> 1040.55s]  You'll copy down each customer's order
[1040.55s -> 1042.57s]  onto an order ticket.
[1042.57s -> 1043.41s]  Garlic on your,
[1043.41s -> 1047.76s]  what kind of person wants garlic on their ice cream?
[1047.76s -> 1048.68s]  Switch to the build station
[1048.68s -> 1053.92s]  and start preparing ice cream and ingredients, okay.
[1053.92s -> 1055.68s]  Watch the meter on the ice cream machine.
[1055.68s -> 1059.70s]  Wait until it's centered, then press the pour button.
[1059.70s -> 1062.26s]  Good.
[1062.26s -> 1064.34s]  All right, and now we need a mixable
[1064.34s -> 1066.12s]  from the mixable machine.
[1066.12s -> 1070.49s]  They want strawberries.
[1071.29s -> 1072.82s]  That was not very good.
[1072.82s -> 1076.96s]  They want strawberry syrup.
[1076.96s -> 1080.85s]  That's a little too many strawberries, don't you think?
[1080.85s -> 1082.17s]  Okay.
[1082.17s -> 1083.85s]  And then drag the cup onto the blender.
[1083.85s -> 1089.54s]  I've always wanted to see how this worked.
[1089.54s -> 1091.06s]  Watch the blend meter on the blender
[1091.06s -> 1094.58s]  and wait till it looks like what they ordered on the ticket.
[1094.58s -> 1099.26s]  Huh?
[1099.26s -> 1104.01s]  How long does this take?
[1104.01s -> 1104.85s]  Okay.
[1104.85s -> 1105.69s]  It's blended.
[1105.69s -> 1108.25s]  Ooh, it looks pretty good.
[1108.25s -> 1112.72s]  Now they want, oh, it's whipped cream.
[1112.72s -> 1113.56s]  Okay.
[1113.56s -> 1115.80s]  Well, I didn't know that when I,
[1115.80s -> 1118.01s]  I thought I had to click it.
[1118.01s -> 1119.53s]  It just goes?
[1119.57s -> 1125.54s]  It just starts going when I let go of the button.
[1125.54s -> 1128.05s]  I didn't press to do that.
[1128.05s -> 1129.73s]  Tap the shakers button.
[1129.73s -> 1132.57s]  What's your type of shakers?
[1132.57s -> 1135.14s]  This is too elaborate.
[1135.14s -> 1141.30s]  Okay.
[1141.30s -> 1143.41s]  Okay, and then drops.
[1143.41s -> 1147.36s]  Free cherries.
[1147.36s -> 1148.20s]  The sundae is finished.
[1148.20s -> 1150.36s]  Drag this over here.
[1150.36s -> 1151.44s]  All right, here you go.
[1151.44s -> 1155.42s]  What do you think?
[1155.42s -> 1156.26s]  It was awful.
[1159.79s -> 1162.82s]  Wait, the whipped cream was next to it.
[1162.82s -> 1164.34s]  Yeah, I thought you ordered it on the side.
[1164.34s -> 1169.07s]  It's like salad dressing.
[1169.07s -> 1171.31s]  All right, you want a medium blended Reese's
[1171.31s -> 1172.99s]  with chocolate, chocolate whipped cream,
[1172.99s -> 1174.27s]  double chocolate Oreos.
[1174.27s -> 1181.59s]  And then, okay.
[1181.59s -> 1185.15s]  I'm gonna do Reese's.
[1185.15s -> 1185.99s]  Reese's in there.
[1185.99s -> 1190.84s]  Chocolate, looks good.
[1190.84s -> 1195.28s]  Blend that up.
[1195.28s -> 1201.70s]  Needs to get to this consistency.
[1201.70s -> 1206.87s]  Medium rare ice cream.
[1206.87s -> 1207.71s]  Good.
[1207.71s -> 1209.02s]  All right, get it over here.
[1209.02s -> 1216.64s]  Next, I need a chocolate, chocolate whipped cream.
[1216.64s -> 1218.16s]  How do I stop it from doing that?
[1218.16s -> 1219.28s]  All right.
[1219.28s -> 1223.22s]  I go middle, I go middle out.
[1223.22s -> 1224.06s]  Do you guys do that?
[1224.06s -> 1224.90s]  How do you guys do it?
[1224.90s -> 1226.54s]  Do you guys go around the rim
[1226.54s -> 1228.38s]  and do a big swirl into the middle?
[1228.38s -> 1230.26s]  Or do you go middle?
[1230.26s -> 1233.50s]  So it goes and fills kind of out.
[1233.50s -> 1234.90s]  I like doing it like that, actually.
[1234.90s -> 1236.42s]  I think you get a good top from doing that.
[1236.42s -> 1240.87s]  You do a swirl.
[1240.87s -> 1246.54s]  All right, let's put some of this on.
[1246.54s -> 1247.38s]  Okay.
[1247.38s -> 1253.96s]  And then you want Oreos like this,
[1253.96s -> 1256.98s]  right in the middle, like this.
[1256.98s -> 1264.19s]  Let's go.
[1264.19s -> 1266.29s]  I gotta stop that from happening.
[1266.29s -> 1274.38s]  $5 tip, nice.
[1274.38s -> 1287.54s]  Not bad, not bad.
[1287.54s -> 1289.42s]  Took you a whole day to do two orders.
[1289.42s -> 1291.02s]  Well, that's because over the course of the whole day,
[1291.02s -> 1293.12s]  only two customers came in.
[1293.12s -> 1295.37s]  Gotcha.
[1295.37s -> 1296.41s]  Mini game show?
[1296.41s -> 1298.77s]  Use the game tickets you earned to play
[1298.77s -> 1302.09s]  in Fudini's daily mini game show.
[1302.09s -> 1305.14s]  What is this?
[1305.14s -> 1306.66s]  10 baddies.
[1306.66s -> 1308.32s]  What the?
[1308.32s -> 1310.78s]  Are these baddies?
[1310.78s -> 1311.62s]  What costume?
[1311.62s -> 1312.46s]  What is a baddie?
[1312.46s -> 1313.58s]  I don't get it.
[1313.58s -> 1320.24s]  Am I winning?
[1320.24s -> 1321.08s]  Okay.
[1321.08s -> 1323.20s]  Ooh, I got a new shirt.
[1323.20s -> 1326.33s]  Let's do it again.
[1326.33s -> 1327.69s]  I've hit 11 baddies.
[1327.69s -> 1332.33s]  Does this keep going up?
[1332.33s -> 1333.57s]  Do I have unlimited ammo?
[1343.15s -> 1353.10s]  Is this the only thing I can do with this?
[1353.10s -> 1354.42s]  I feel like I'm playing the Resident Evil mini game
[1354.42s -> 1359.89s]  all over again.
[1359.89s -> 1362.43s]  Let's go.
[1362.43s -> 1363.55s]  Ooh, I got a table.
[1363.55s -> 1367.11s]  Decoration?
[1367.11s -> 1369.53s]  Okay.
[1369.53s -> 1371.03s]  Cool.
[1371.03s -> 1372.35s]  New clothes?
[1372.35s -> 1378.36s]  Yup.
[1378.36s -> 1379.89s]  What's that mean?
[1379.89s -> 1386.41s]  What's that mean?
[1386.41s -> 1387.53s]  Okay.
[1387.53s -> 1388.37s]  New.
[1388.37s -> 1389.75s]  Ooh, I can decorate my lobby.
[1389.75s -> 1391.39s]  Tap the open button to view and choose items
[1391.39s -> 1392.27s]  you purchased in the shop.
[1392.27s -> 1393.11s]  All right.
[1393.11s -> 1396.64s]  Here's the table.
[1396.64s -> 1398.12s]  First items that can be dragged to the front
[1398.12s -> 1399.12s]  or back areas of the floor.
[1399.12s -> 1401.36s]  Drag furniture to the red x-ray
[1401.36s -> 1406.00s]  to remove from the lobby.
[1406.00s -> 1410.14s]  I think it's fine there.
[1410.14s -> 1418.48s]  Stickers?
[1418.48s -> 1420.41s]  Do I have any stickers?
[1420.41s -> 1423.20s]  I don't think I have any.
[1423.20s -> 1424.24s]  These are achievements.
[1424.24s -> 1425.20s]  Okay, they added achievements.
[1425.20s -> 1426.34s]  What's this?
[1426.34s -> 1429.20s]  Start a parade.
[1429.20s -> 1432.78s]  Does this cost money?
[1432.78s -> 1439.54s]  That cost money?
[1439.54s -> 1441.07s]  I'll do it later.
[1441.07s -> 1441.91s]  All right, let's go.
[1441.91s -> 1443.42s]  I get it.
[1443.42s -> 1446.61s]  New customer.
[1446.61s -> 1447.61s]  Pink lemonade syrup.
[1447.61s -> 1451.31s]  Okay.
[1451.31s -> 1459.86s]  Sugar plum topping.
[1459.86s -> 1460.70s]  All right.
[1460.70s -> 1464.17s]  What do you got?
[1464.17s -> 1465.09s]  Medium.
[1465.09s -> 1465.93s]  Blended.
[1465.93s -> 1467.55s]  Strawberry.
[1467.55s -> 1469.01s]  Lemonade.
[1469.01s -> 1471.46s]  Whipped cream.
[1471.46s -> 1472.70s]  Magical.
[1472.70s -> 1475.15s]  Whatever fruit that is.
[1475.15s -> 1475.99s]  Okay, let's go.
[1475.99s -> 1478.92s]  I got it.
[1478.92s -> 1486.26s]  Let's do this quick.
[1486.26s -> 1487.10s]  Okay.
[1487.10s -> 1487.92s]  Go, blend it.
[1487.92s -> 1490.66s]  Anybody else?
[1490.66s -> 1491.50s]  Just you?
[1491.50s -> 1493.14s]  All right, good.
[1493.14s -> 1496.39s]  Oops.
[1496.39s -> 1498.88s]  Why is this taking so long?
[1498.88s -> 1499.72s]  Why is this taking so long?
[1499.72s -> 1505.62s]  This machine sucks.
[1505.62s -> 1506.46s]  Medium.
[1506.46s -> 1508.05s]  Blend.
[1508.05s -> 1508.87s]  Reese's banana.
[1508.87s -> 1509.88s]  Chocolate.
[1509.88s -> 1510.96s]  Chocolate.
[1510.96s -> 1511.78s]  Banana.
[1511.78s -> 1512.62s]  Banana.
[1512.62s -> 1514.09s]  Banana.
[1514.09s -> 1514.91s]  You got it.
[1514.91s -> 1515.75s]  All right.
[1515.75s -> 1516.59s]  Take us to the line.
[1516.59s -> 1518.86s]  Organize them.
[1518.86s -> 1519.70s]  Okay.
[1519.70s -> 1520.54s]  This thing's still going.
[1520.54s -> 1524.42s]  All right, all right, all right.
[1524.42s -> 1525.26s]  Keep going.
[1525.26s -> 1526.10s]  I want to get a good view of this.
[1526.10s -> 1528.57s]  How do I get a good view of this?
[1528.57s -> 1532.50s]  How do I get a good view of that?
[1532.50s -> 1534.02s]  There it is.
[1534.02s -> 1534.86s]  Okay.
[1534.86s -> 1537.46s]  Is this thing done?
[1537.46s -> 1538.30s]  All right.
[1538.30s -> 1539.32s]  What do you want?
[1539.32s -> 1540.14s]  You want Reese's.
[1540.14s -> 1540.98s]  You want banana.
[1542.95s -> 1544.33s]  And then.
[1544.33s -> 1545.43s]  Okay, good.
[1545.43s -> 1546.27s]  Put that on.
[1546.27s -> 1549.83s]  Take this one off.
[1549.83s -> 1557.35s]  You wanted whipped cream.
[1557.35s -> 1558.19s]  Okay.
[1558.19s -> 1560.84s]  And then you also wanted.
[1560.84s -> 1561.68s]  Is it plum?
[1563.27s -> 1564.11s]  Oops.
[1564.11s -> 1564.93s]  Okay.
[1564.93s -> 1565.77s]  That actually looks pretty good.
[1565.77s -> 1571.74s]  And then you want three cherries.
[1571.74s -> 1572.58s]  All right.
[1572.58s -> 1574.04s]  Let's go.
[1574.04s -> 1582.02s]  Take that.
[1582.02s -> 1583.29s]  All right.
[1583.29s -> 1584.13s]  I got to hurry up.
[1584.13s -> 1584.95s]  Anybody else?
[1584.95s -> 1588.08s]  Oh, shit.
[1588.08s -> 1588.92s]  Okay.
[1588.92s -> 1589.78s]  Is it a brownie?
[1589.78s -> 1590.62s]  Brownie.
[1590.62s -> 1592.42s]  What is that?
[1592.42s -> 1598.12s]  Okay.
[1598.12s -> 1601.03s]  Okay.
[1601.03s -> 1603.18s]  Brownie chunks.
[1603.18s -> 1604.02s]  What is this?
[1604.02s -> 1610.52s]  What is this moon?
[1610.52s -> 1611.36s]  All right.
[1611.36s -> 1612.78s]  You wanted chocolate with cream.
[1614.58s -> 1617.36s]  Coconut.
[1617.36s -> 1618.20s]  Coconut.
[1618.20s -> 1619.04s]  Where is it?
[1621.50s -> 1623.74s]  And then one Oreo.
[1623.74s -> 1624.70s]  Is this the right order?
[1624.70s -> 1625.54s]  Fuck.
[1625.54s -> 1627.82s]  This is the wrong order.
[1627.82s -> 1628.66s]  Oh, shit.
[1628.66s -> 1629.50s]  How do I change this?
[1634.03s -> 1635.03s]  I fucked it up.
[1635.03s -> 1635.95s]  It's okay.
[1635.95s -> 1636.79s]  It's all right.
[1639.08s -> 1639.90s]  I fucked it up.
[1639.90s -> 1640.74s]  It's okay.
[1640.74s -> 1642.54s]  You still liked it.
[1642.54s -> 1644.54s]  You still gave me three dollar tip.
[1644.54s -> 1645.88s]  This one's wrong too then.
[1647.47s -> 1653.38s]  I got to throw this away.
[1653.38s -> 1654.22s]  All right.
[1654.22s -> 1657.97s]  Reese's.
[1657.97s -> 1658.81s]  And then.
[1658.81s -> 1666.97s]  Nana.
[1666.97s -> 1668.07s]  This customer is a closer.
[1668.07s -> 1669.27s]  They're very picky about their food.
[1669.27s -> 1671.55s]  They'll be tougher when grading.
[1672.25s -> 1674.42s]  I can handle it.
[1674.42s -> 1675.26s]  You're going to get fired?
[1675.26s -> 1676.08s]  I am.
[1676.08s -> 1679.40s]  I'm going to be fine.
[1679.40s -> 1680.24s]  All right.
[1680.24s -> 1682.62s]  Really picky about their order.
[1682.62s -> 1686.78s]  How's that not perfect?
[1686.78s -> 1689.13s]  This one's still going.
[1689.13s -> 1690.43s]  Anybody else?
[1690.43s -> 1691.27s]  No, that's it.
[1691.27s -> 1696.62s]  All right.
[1696.62s -> 1697.46s]  So this one's coming off first.
[1697.46s -> 1701.64s]  So don't be stupid about this.
[1701.64s -> 1703.60s]  And this one is chocolate with cream.
[1703.60s -> 1704.94s]  Chocolate rocks.
[1704.94s -> 1706.04s]  And then three bananas.
[1707.38s -> 1708.94s]  Chocolate, chocolate, banana.
[1708.94s -> 1710.74s]  Banana.
[1710.74s -> 1712.04s]  Make one for yourself.
[1713.14s -> 1721.78s]  Cost money?
[1721.78s -> 1727.85s]  Does that cost money though?
[1727.85s -> 1728.69s]  All right.
[1728.69s -> 1730.22s]  Here we go.
[1733.62s -> 1735.20s]  Good.
[1735.20s -> 1736.64s]  They wanted these.
[1736.64s -> 1737.56s]  Chocolate.
[1737.56s -> 1738.40s]  Whatever.
[1738.40s -> 1739.24s]  What are these?
[1739.24s -> 1740.75s]  Chocolate.
[1740.75s -> 1741.59s]  Whatever there.
[1741.59s -> 1742.93s]  And then you wanted bananas.
[1746.71s -> 1747.55s]  Good.
[1747.55s -> 1748.39s]  Go.
[1748.39s -> 1749.21s]  There you are.
[1749.21s -> 1753.75s]  Sorry for the wait.
[1753.75s -> 1756.43s]  Let's get a ticket.
[1756.43s -> 1757.27s]  All right.
[1757.27s -> 1758.80s]  I see.
[1758.80s -> 1759.62s]  Oh shit.
[1759.62s -> 1760.46s]  Take that off.
[1760.46s -> 1761.30s]  All right.
[1761.30s -> 1762.14s]  This person's very picky about this.
[1762.14s -> 1768.38s]  So we want to make this perfect.
[1768.38s -> 1771.33s]  That's, it was close.
[1771.33s -> 1772.17s]  All right.
[1772.17s -> 1778.82s]  Then you want peanuts?
[1778.82s -> 1779.66s]  Shit!
[1779.66s -> 1781.12s]  How do I clean?
[1781.12s -> 1783.93s]  I would hate to hear that.
[1784.57s -> 1786.05s]  I would hate to hear that from the back.
[1786.05s -> 1786.89s]  Shit!
[1786.89s -> 1798.32s]  When they, you know they're working on your order.
[1798.32s -> 1803.43s]  What do you think?
[1803.43s -> 1804.25s]  Not bad.
[1804.25s -> 1814.10s]  All right.
[1814.10s -> 1817.20s]  I mean, we could have done better on the building.
[1817.20s -> 1819.63s]  That's for sure.
[1819.63s -> 1820.47s]  I got money though.
[1820.47s -> 1826.42s]  I'm doing all right.
[1826.42s -> 1838.23s]  Rank two.
[1838.23s -> 1839.27s]  Chili works.
[1839.27s -> 1842.29s]  Okay.
[1842.29s -> 1843.65s]  Yeah.
[1843.65s -> 1844.47s]  Hold on.
[1844.47s -> 1845.31s]  Give me one second.
[1845.31s -> 1846.61s]  I have a very important thing
[1846.61s -> 1849.55s]  that I have to take care of very quickly.
[1849.55s -> 1850.39s]  Give me one second.
[1850.39s -> 1853.38s]  I'll be back in literally two minutes.
[1853.38s -> 1854.89s]  Quick BRB.
[1854.89s -> 2023.94s]  Give me two seconds.
[2023.94s -> 2024.78s]  Okay.
[2025.30s -> 2027.54s]  Sorry.
[2027.54s -> 2030.34s]  Just had to do something very, very quickly.
[2030.34s -> 2032.23s]  We're good.
[2032.23s -> 2033.05s]  I told you I'm right back.
[2033.05s -> 2033.89s]  I'm right back.
[2033.89s -> 2039.07s]  We didn't go anywhere.
[2039.07s -> 2040.60s]  All right.
[2040.60s -> 2041.42s]  Here we go.
[2041.42s -> 2047.57s]  So this is Rico's Chili Works.
[2047.57s -> 2049.83s]  How does this one work?
[2049.83s -> 2050.67s]  Oh, great.
[2050.67s -> 2051.51s]  Okay.
[2051.51s -> 2056.56s]  Just connect everything and then do what?
[2056.56s -> 2057.40s]  Okay.
[2057.40s -> 2061.91s]  I got this.
[2061.91s -> 2062.75s]  Yeah.
[2062.75s -> 2063.79s]  Everyone's going to, oh, know me on this one.
[2063.79s -> 2068.75s]  But I, when they're not that difficult, I can get them.
[2068.75s -> 2069.73s]  Like this is not that bad.
[2069.73s -> 2077.28s]  I can handle this.
[2077.28s -> 2078.12s]  I can handle it.
[2078.12s -> 2088.52s]  Let's see.
[2088.52s -> 2090.11s]  Hold on.
[2090.11s -> 2091.64s]  Hold on.
[2093.34s -> 2094.86s]  Look.
[2094.86s -> 2102.78s]  See?
[2102.78s -> 2104.02s]  Payday in four days.
[2104.02s -> 2105.48s]  I get a hundred bucks.
[2105.48s -> 2110.27s]  Okay.
[2110.27s -> 2112.23s]  I'm just going to put on every new piece of tire
[2112.23s -> 2113.92s]  that comes in.
[2113.92s -> 2116.53s]  Top and trim.
[2116.53s -> 2117.89s]  Countertop and wall trim.
[2117.89s -> 2121.48s]  Okay.
[2121.48s -> 2125.77s]  Oh, that's my counter.
[2125.77s -> 2138.91s]  I need, I need German 985 green.
[2138.91s -> 2146.84s]  There you go.
[2146.84s -> 2154.00s]  That's not green, but I support you.
[2154.00s -> 2154.84s]  What do you mean?
[2154.84s -> 2162.56s]  This is teal, like aqua, kind of green, coral, spearmint.
[2163.26s -> 2166.47s]  I don't know.
[2166.47s -> 2168.89s]  Yeah.
[2168.89s -> 2169.71s]  That's fine.
[2169.71s -> 2170.55s]  Should I do parade?
[2170.55s -> 2173.49s]  No, it probably costs money.
[2173.49s -> 2175.47s]  What is this shop?
[2175.47s -> 2179.09s]  Is that actual money or no?
[2179.09s -> 2182.60s]  New customer.
[2182.60s -> 2185.62s]  It's definitely not green.
[2185.62s -> 2193.26s]  That's definitely green.
[2193.26s -> 2194.08s]  All right.
[2194.08s -> 2200.28s]  Let's go.
[2200.28s -> 2201.34s]  What do you want?
[2201.34s -> 2205.00s]  Medium, blended, blueberry.
[2205.00s -> 2207.99s]  What flavor is this?
[2207.99s -> 2210.67s]  All right.
[2210.67s -> 2214.16s]  What is that flavor?
[2214.16s -> 2215.36s]  Moon flavor.
[2215.36s -> 2216.20s]  Yeah.
[2216.20s -> 2221.36s]  Well, what is moon flavor?
[2221.36s -> 2222.20s]  Wait, don't get me wrong.
[2222.20s -> 2223.02s]  It looks awesome.
[2223.02s -> 2225.83s]  I'd want to try it.
[2225.83s -> 2226.67s]  All right.
[2226.67s -> 2227.73s]  Just you.
[2227.73s -> 2228.57s]  That's good.
[2228.57s -> 2229.91s]  Want me to make one for myself?
[2229.91s -> 2232.23s]  I'll make one for myself.
[2232.23s -> 2233.07s]  All right.
[2233.07s -> 2233.89s]  If it were me right now,
[2233.89s -> 2237.24s]  I'm doing an Oreo cookie
[2237.24s -> 2241.32s]  and I don't know whatever this is.
[2242.81s -> 2250.19s]  I'm going to cream.
[2250.19s -> 2254.20s]  I'm going to get fired.
[2254.20s -> 2256.83s]  All right.
[2256.83s -> 2258.27s]  Oh, yep.
[2258.27s -> 2259.21s]  Special recipe.
[2259.21s -> 2260.59s]  They'll be tougher when grading their order,
[2260.59s -> 2261.93s]  but you can earn a new recipe to serve.
[2261.93s -> 2264.75s]  It's a tough recipe.
[2264.75s -> 2269.43s]  Why is this so tough?
[2269.43s -> 2270.27s]  Okay.
[2270.27s -> 2271.33s]  What do you want?
[2271.33s -> 2272.17s]  Shit.
[2272.17s -> 2272.99s]  Okay.
[2272.99s -> 2273.83s]  It's fine.
[2273.83s -> 2276.00s]  How is this so different?
[2276.00s -> 2278.94s]  Banana?
[2278.94s -> 2280.21s]  Come on.
[2280.21s -> 2281.03s]  That up.
[2281.03s -> 2284.93s]  This went off.
[2284.93s -> 2286.83s]  Perfect.
[2286.83s -> 2287.67s]  All right.
[2288.71s -> 2289.67s]  This looks good.
[2293.23s -> 2294.07s]  Good.
[2294.07s -> 2294.89s]  Okay.
[2294.89s -> 2295.73s]  And you also want,
[2295.73s -> 2297.97s]  you want blueberry sauce?
[2297.97s -> 2299.97s]  Oh, white chocolate.
[2299.97s -> 2301.73s]  Oh, you've ruined everything now.
[2301.73s -> 2303.33s]  This is ruined.
[2303.33s -> 2306.63s]  This is ruined.
[2306.63s -> 2314.56s]  Wait, what is that?
[2314.56s -> 2319.61s]  Okay.
[2320.61s -> 2321.45s]  Why did I make that?
[2321.45s -> 2322.57s]  I don't even want to give that to anybody.
[2322.57s -> 2324.33s]  I just made it for fun.
[2324.33s -> 2325.17s]  All right.
[2325.17s -> 2328.59s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[2328.59s -> 2330.83s]  This one goes in the middle.
[2330.83s -> 2332.31s]  And then two of these.
[2334.66s -> 2340.66s]  Go.
[2340.66s -> 2343.74s]  I like very plain ice cream orders.
[2343.74s -> 2344.58s]  I know that there's a lot of,
[2344.58s -> 2345.40s]  donut places.
[2345.40s -> 2347.94s]  Have you seen the donut places do this too?
[2347.94s -> 2348.78s]  I don't know.
[2348.78s -> 2349.60s]  I'm not in,
[2349.60s -> 2351.97s]  I just want it to be like,
[2351.97s -> 2353.85s]  give me like Oreo cookies in it,
[2353.85s -> 2355.53s]  or give me chocolate,
[2355.53s -> 2356.45s]  give me vanilla,
[2356.45s -> 2358.68s]  give me like banana.
[2358.68s -> 2359.50s]  I don't,
[2359.50s -> 2361.45s]  too many things in each order.
[2361.45s -> 2362.29s]  I like,
[2362.29s -> 2363.13s]  if you give me an ice cream,
[2363.13s -> 2373.48s]  I want it just to be that one thing that I want to taste.
[2373.48s -> 2374.68s]  That's pretty perfect.
[2374.68s -> 2379.36s]  Peanuts?
[2379.36s -> 2381.88s]  I don't like peanuts on anything really either.
[2381.88s -> 2387.93s]  I like eating peanuts by themselves.
[2387.93s -> 2394.84s]  Here you go.
[2394.84s -> 2398.31s]  Strawberry brownie.
[2398.31s -> 2407.25s]  Oh shit.
[2407.25s -> 2408.57s]  Is that an eggplant?
[2408.57s -> 2410.01s]  What is that?
[2410.01s -> 2419.60s]  You can get eggplant on ice cream?
[2419.60s -> 2423.52s]  All right, let's go.
[2423.52s -> 2425.50s]  Hurry up.
[2425.50s -> 2427.84s]  Strawberry.
[2427.84s -> 2430.78s]  Strawberry.
[2430.78s -> 2431.60s]  Get that on there.
[2431.60s -> 2434.28s]  Another one.
[2434.28s -> 2435.50s]  This one is,
[2435.50s -> 2436.48s]  cake and moon.
[2438.49s -> 2439.33s]  And moon.
[2440.17s -> 2441.57s]  Good.
[2441.57s -> 2442.41s]  Line that up.
[2442.41s -> 2444.24s]  Is that it?
[2444.24s -> 2445.08s]  Anybody else?
[2445.08s -> 2445.92s]  Yep.
[2445.92s -> 2446.76s]  All right.
[2446.76s -> 2447.58s]  This is,
[2447.58s -> 2451.41s]  this person's angry.
[2451.41s -> 2452.25s]  And I want sprinkles on it.
[2452.25s -> 2453.29s]  And I want cherries on it.
[2453.29s -> 2454.45s]  And I want cookies on it.
[2455.29s -> 2456.25s]  It's like, all right, come on.
[2456.25s -> 2462.25s]  Relax.
[2462.25s -> 2464.88s]  I don't know how you order this angry.
[2464.88s -> 2465.72s]  Yeah.
[2465.72s -> 2469.64s]  And I'll take a large blended ice cream please.
[2469.64s -> 2470.92s]  And I want strawberry sprinkles on it.
[2470.92s -> 2472.16s]  And I want whipped cream on it.
[2472.16s -> 2472.98s]  And I want that,
[2472.98s -> 2474.24s]  the fancy little cookie thing on it too.
[2474.24s -> 2478.59s]  How do you order that angrily?
[2478.59s -> 2481.39s]  I feel like you can't order that angry.
[2481.39s -> 2482.23s]  All right.
[2482.23s -> 2483.05s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2483.05s -> 2484.55s]  Stop talking and play the game.
[2484.55s -> 2485.75s]  Oh shit.
[2485.75s -> 2486.59s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2486.59s -> 2487.41s]  I got time.
[2487.41s -> 2488.25s]  I got time.
[2488.25s -> 2489.09s]  What do you want?
[2489.09s -> 2492.75s]  Strawberries?
[2492.75s -> 2493.57s]  Shit.
[2493.57s -> 2496.26s]  Okay.
[2496.26s -> 2497.10s]  All right.
[2497.10s -> 2499.18s]  This is this one.
[2499.18s -> 2501.10s]  Uh-oh.
[2501.10s -> 2501.94s]  What do you want?
[2501.94s -> 2502.76s]  What do you want?
[2502.76s -> 2503.60s]  What do you want?
[2503.60s -> 2506.60s]  What do you want?
[2506.60s -> 2512.41s]  Chocolate?
[2512.41s -> 2513.25s]  Hey.
[2514.57s -> 2515.41s]  Quiet.
[2515.41s -> 2526.92s]  Everybody stop talking.
[2526.92s -> 2527.76s]  All right.
[2527.76s -> 2528.58s]  Thank you.
[2528.58s -> 2529.42s]  I appreciate it.
[2529.42s -> 2530.26s]  I gotta go.
[2530.26s -> 2531.08s]  I have to take this one off now.
[2531.08s -> 2531.92s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[2531.92s -> 2533.17s]  I gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[2533.17s -> 2534.01s]  This one's overblended.
[2534.01s -> 2535.76s]  Fuck.
[2535.76s -> 2537.46s]  Overblended.
[2537.46s -> 2539.54s]  Ruined it.
[2539.54s -> 2540.38s]  Okay.
[2540.38s -> 2545.17s]  You want a coconut?
[2550.62s -> 2551.72s]  And then you wanted,
[2551.72s -> 2552.56s]  you want this other,
[2552.56s -> 2553.40s]  what is this?
[2553.40s -> 2561.65s]  Like Lucky Charms or something?
[2561.65s -> 2566.64s]  Go.
[2567.20s -> 2569.04s]  What is that a 60?
[2569.04s -> 2573.20s]  Oh, cause I overblended it.
[2573.20s -> 2574.04s]  All right.
[2574.04s -> 2579.35s]  This one has to be perfect.
[2579.35s -> 2586.38s]  And then this one is sprinkles.
[2586.38s -> 2594.53s]  Nice distribution.
[2594.53s -> 2600.60s]  There you go.
[2600.60s -> 2601.68s]  Overblended a little.
[2601.68s -> 2605.43s]  Oh no.
[2605.43s -> 2606.27s]  Well, I mean,
[2609.83s -> 2610.79s]  what is that purple thing?
[2610.79s -> 2611.63s]  Please help.
[2611.63s -> 2613.50s]  I don't know.
[2613.50s -> 2623.32s]  I thought it was an eggplant.
[2623.32s -> 2627.39s]  You're done.
[2627.39s -> 2628.47s]  Hop us raceway.
[2628.47s -> 2630.38s]  Sure.
[2630.38s -> 2631.20s]  Win the race.
[2631.20s -> 2632.42s]  Collect points to go faster.
[2632.42s -> 2636.20s]  How do you drive?
[2636.20s -> 2637.04s]  How do I drive?
[2642.38s -> 2644.48s]  I thought I was the person,
[2644.48s -> 2646.44s]  I thought I was the person at the bottom.
[2646.44s -> 2647.48s]  I don't know why I was,
[2647.48s -> 2649.84s]  I thought I was the person at the very bottom.
[2649.84s -> 2656.98s]  I would love to restart this.
[2656.98s -> 2657.82s]  All right.
[2657.82s -> 2658.66s]  Let me do that again.
[2658.66s -> 2661.96s]  Also, the frame rate of this game kind of hurts my head.
[2661.96s -> 2665.59s]  I gotta be very honest.
[2665.59s -> 2675.84s]  The road is kind of making my head hurt.
[2675.84s -> 2677.52s]  How am I supposed to collect the coins?
[2677.52s -> 2683.84s]  If they're in the way.
[2683.84s -> 2684.68s]  There we go.
[2684.68s -> 2695.49s]  All right.
[2695.49s -> 2696.31s]  We're good.
[2696.31s -> 2707.57s]  I got new pants.
[2707.57s -> 2708.65s]  That's pretty cool.
[2708.65s -> 2709.47s]  All right.
[2709.47s -> 2718.29s]  Good.
[2718.29s -> 2725.96s]  It's all mine now.
[2725.96s -> 2726.96s]  How was he playing this?
[2727.80s -> 2731.09s]  This is now on Steam.
[2731.09s -> 2735.73s]  This is the deluxe version of the game.
[2735.73s -> 2738.09s]  It's on Steam right now.
[2738.09s -> 2739.77s]  I guess they made some changes to it.
[2739.77s -> 2740.61s]  I don't know what they are.
[2740.61s -> 2741.43s]  I don't know.
[2741.43s -> 2742.27s]  I have no idea.
[2742.27s -> 2743.11s]  I can make a special.
[2743.11s -> 2746.28s]  Ooh, strawberry brownie.
[2746.28s -> 2752.16s]  Look at that.
[2752.16s -> 2753.00s]  Looks elaborate.
[2753.00s -> 2758.04s]  Okay.
[2758.04s -> 2759.04s]  I got some new stuff.
[2759.04s -> 2762.81s]  Did I get some?
[2762.81s -> 2764.61s]  What about shop?
[2764.61s -> 2769.23s]  I got 61 bucks.
[2769.23s -> 2770.31s]  Doorbell.
[2770.31s -> 2772.74s]  You'll hear when new customers enter.
[2772.74s -> 2777.20s]  Oh, that's helpful.
[2777.20s -> 2778.28s]  Customer coupon.
[2778.28s -> 2784.97s]  Send one to a specific customer to get them to visit again.
[2784.97s -> 2789.75s]  Lender booster?
[2790.59s -> 2791.43s]  Really?
[2791.43s -> 2792.27s]  Okay.
[2792.27s -> 2794.82s]  Well, I don't think I need any of these.
[2794.82s -> 2795.66s]  What about some of this?
[2795.66s -> 2800.23s]  I mean, this table is a must have.
[2800.23s -> 2807.32s]  Look at how tacky this is.
[2807.32s -> 2809.24s]  You know how annoying this would be to clean?
[2809.24s -> 2810.08s]  Because all the food,
[2810.08s -> 2811.72s]  all the syrup would just get in the crevices.
[2811.72s -> 2815.82s]  It'd be so annoying.
[2815.82s -> 2816.64s]  Ooh.
[2816.64s -> 2822.20s]  Hold on.
[2822.20s -> 2823.04s]  Get the doorbell.
[2823.04s -> 2828.28s]  The doorbell's way more important.
[2828.28s -> 2833.23s]  I guess it is only $4.
[2833.23s -> 2835.37s]  Thanksgiving.
[2835.37s -> 2837.38s]  Oh, look at this.
[2837.38s -> 2838.66s]  It's got marshmallows on it.
[2838.66s -> 2844.19s]  Midnight freeze.
[2844.19s -> 2847.87s]  Okay.
[2847.87s -> 2854.07s]  How do I do it?
[2854.07s -> 2859.89s]  Oh, that's good.
[2859.89s -> 2870.86s]  This gives me points, right?
[2870.86s -> 2872.78s]  Now, we gotta make sure the kids can see.
[2872.78s -> 2884.56s]  We gotta make sure the kids can see.
[2884.56s -> 2885.90s]  Let's go.
[2885.90s -> 2892.39s]  I got my special selected.
[2892.39s -> 2895.66s]  Marshmallows are now available.
[2895.66s -> 2899.24s]  Mint syrup is now available for one person to order
[2899.24s -> 2903.93s]  every three days or every week.
[2903.93s -> 2912.97s]  Can we hold in that bottle till expiration?
[2912.97s -> 2914.97s]  And I love, I like mint too.
[2914.97s -> 2916.29s]  I like mint chocolate chip.
[2916.29s -> 2917.97s]  I like that flavor.
[2917.97s -> 2926.39s]  I'm just telling you.
[2926.39s -> 2931.15s]  Marshmallow, mint?
[2931.15s -> 2933.56s]  Marshmallow, mint.
[2933.56s -> 2942.88s]  I kind of feel like this is gonna be kind of good.
[2942.88s -> 2948.57s]  That sounds actually awesome.
[2948.57s -> 2951.64s]  Can I help you?
[2951.64s -> 2954.10s]  I want a strawberry brownie.
[2954.10s -> 2956.86s]  Okay.
[2956.86s -> 2959.16s]  What?
[2959.16s -> 2959.98s]  Oh, shit.
[2959.98s -> 2960.96s]  Okay.
[2960.96s -> 2963.88s]  Well, it's ice cream.
[2963.88s -> 2964.72s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2964.72s -> 2965.56s]  Okay, I got time.
[2967.55s -> 2969.04s]  What the hell's in this?
[2969.04s -> 2975.11s]  Chocolate, strawberries.
[2975.11s -> 2976.87s]  And then it's a bunch of other shit later.
[2976.87s -> 2983.26s]  Okay.
[2983.26s -> 2989.20s]  This is where I would just, I would start dancing.
[2989.20s -> 2992.12s]  Just kind of with my hands, moving back and forth,
[2992.12s -> 2994.50s]  smiling.
[2994.50s -> 2995.66s]  And then when they take their phone up,
[2995.66s -> 2998.38s]  no, no, no, no, no, no video or no photography at all.
[2998.38s -> 3006.81s]  Allowed.
[3006.81s -> 3007.65s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[3007.65s -> 3008.49s]  Okay, okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[3008.65s -> 3009.49s]  What am I doing?
[3009.49s -> 3019.38s]  I'm waiting.
[3019.38s -> 3037.35s]  Coconut and a cherry.
[3037.35s -> 3038.19s]  This is still good.
[3038.19s -> 3039.01s]  We're still good.
[3039.01s -> 3045.91s]  We're good, good, good, good, good.
[3045.91s -> 3046.81s]  He's talking about dancing behind
[3046.81s -> 3048.97s]  an imaginary ice cream counter.
[3048.97s -> 3050.07s]  I'm good.
[3050.07s -> 3051.53s]  A little bit overblended, but it's all right.
[3051.53s -> 3053.65s]  It's the special.
[3053.65s -> 3055.41s]  All right, then now we need
[3055.41s -> 3065.51s]  chocolate whipped cream, chocolate sauce.
[3065.51s -> 3072.04s]  Okay, now strawberry sauce.
[3072.04s -> 3073.12s]  Okay.
[3073.12s -> 3080.21s]  And then chocolate chips and cherries.
[3080.21s -> 3081.05s]  How many cherries?
[3081.05s -> 3089.68s]  Three.
[3089.68s -> 3098.38s]  73?
[3098.38s -> 3104.87s]  All right, I gotta do these quick.
[3104.87s -> 3105.91s]  This one's kind of elaborate.
[3105.91s -> 3110.04s]  I'm gonna do this one last.
[3110.04s -> 3112.00s]  Thank you for your patience, by the way.
[3112.00s -> 3121.83s]  We appreciate it.
[3121.83s -> 3124.32s]  What do you want?
[3124.32s -> 3126.76s]  Medium blueberry with whipped cream,
[3126.76s -> 3129.48s]  strawberry sauce, coconut, sprinkles.
[3129.48s -> 3132.32s]  This is kind of, oh, this is like too much.
[3132.32s -> 3134.56s]  That's a little too much.
[3134.56s -> 3136.18s]  I gotta put three of these up.
[3136.18s -> 3142.31s]  Blueberry, strawberry.
[3142.31s -> 3143.63s]  Blend that up.
[3143.63s -> 3145.96s]  Keep going.
[3145.96s -> 3147.12s]  Oh my God, I forget everything.
[3147.12s -> 3149.46s]  I forget everything that everybody ordered.
[3149.46s -> 3152.80s]  Which one have I not done?
[3152.80s -> 3154.08s]  This is blueberry, strawberry.
[3154.08s -> 3155.72s]  This one is blueberry, strawberry.
[3155.72s -> 3156.92s]  I haven't done this one.
[3159.93s -> 3160.77s]  Did I just do this one?
[3160.77s -> 3165.92s]  Did I just do that one?
[3165.92s -> 3169.68s]  I just did that one?
[3169.68s -> 3171.59s]  What's the one I haven't done?
[3171.59s -> 3180.00s]  Blueberry and moon, okay.
[3180.00s -> 3181.48s]  Who's is this?
[3181.48s -> 3183.40s]  Oh shit, who's was that?
[3183.40s -> 3186.74s]  Is this one right?
[3186.74s -> 3187.98s]  Is this one right?
[3187.98s -> 3202.44s]  Yep.
[3202.44s -> 3205.24s]  Plant, cookie, banana.
[3205.24s -> 3209.39s]  Get it out.
[3209.39s -> 3210.71s]  This is a kids' game.
[3210.71s -> 3213.07s]  Papa's games are not kids' games.
[3213.07s -> 3214.47s]  They're incredibly stressful games
[3214.47s -> 3218.07s]  that require a ton of work and time and work and thoughts.
[3219.37s -> 3221.09s]  Oh, this one's just sitting here.
[3221.09s -> 3222.89s]  Which one is this one?
[3222.89s -> 3225.57s]  This one is strawberry and this one, okay.
[3225.57s -> 3230.79s]  Somebody's gonna be pissed, but whatever.
[3230.79s -> 3233.60s]  It's all right, I fucked it up.
[3233.60s -> 3243.33s]  It's all right, I fucked it up.
[3243.33s -> 3247.19s]  I gotta go, this looks like it melted
[3247.19s -> 3249.50s]  for like a half an hour.
[3249.50s -> 3251.82s]  This is why I always wanna eat one of these before,
[3251.82s -> 3254.90s]  you pull over, you park and you eat this.
[3254.90s -> 3258.02s]  Because if you just let it sit in the fucking tray,
[3258.02s -> 3259.58s]  in the cup holder, it turns into this
[3259.58s -> 3263.83s]  by the time you get back.
[3263.83s -> 3267.76s]  You pull over and you park and you eat it.
[3267.76s -> 3268.60s]  Serve it already.
[3268.76s -> 3272.59s]  I'm going as fast as I wanna go.
[3272.59s -> 3280.42s]  But fine, is it?
[3280.42s -> 3285.47s]  Oh, this is actually really long.
[3285.47s -> 3287.17s]  You were here first.
[3287.17s -> 3296.20s]  Oh, fuck.
[3296.20s -> 3299.44s]  What are your thoughts on Horton, Here's a Who?
[3299.44s -> 3305.48s]  I don't think I ever saw that movie.
[3305.48s -> 3309.28s]  Just checking to see if you're still here.
[3309.28s -> 3310.12s]  It's a book.
[3310.12s -> 3317.96s]  Yeah, I know.
[3317.96s -> 3320.28s]  Promise that one is yours.
[3320.28s -> 3321.68s]  You can hear it right now.
[3321.68s -> 3323.16s]  I wanted to make sure it was fresh for you.
[3323.16s -> 3344.42s]  I wanted to make it fresh.
[3344.42s -> 3348.29s]  Working on it right now.
[3348.29s -> 3359.12s]  Hey, I just opened a fresh can of white chocolate for you.
[3359.68s -> 3360.52s]  These sprinkles?
[3360.52s -> 3363.04s]  Oh, these sprinkles, I don't wanna serve these to you.
[3363.04s -> 3376.40s]  Let me open up a new thing of sprinkles for you.
[3376.40s -> 3377.68s]  All right.
[3377.68s -> 3387.06s]  Hey, by the way, thanks.
[3387.06s -> 3396.03s]  That wasn't that bad.
[3396.03s -> 3398.49s]  I will allow one comedy.
[3398.49s -> 3401.08s]  I'm gonna allow one comedy order
[3401.08s -> 3405.83s]  where we just give a person a cup of cherries or something.
[3405.83s -> 3406.67s]  That's fine for me.
[3406.67s -> 3407.51s]  We'll do it.
[3407.51s -> 3408.35s]  Why am I?
[3408.35s -> 3409.35s]  Why am I?
[3409.35s -> 3418.40s]  Okay, I was like, what the hell?
[3418.40s -> 3423.04s]  You guys ever want the actual tactic to do that?
[3423.08s -> 3427.20s]  So always keep your mouse cursor right in the middle
[3427.20s -> 3430.16s]  and don't shoot at any of the discs that come out
[3430.16s -> 3434.38s]  until kind of close to the end.
[3434.38s -> 3435.42s]  Don't do this.
[3435.42s -> 3436.26s]  Stay right here.
[3436.26s -> 3439.38s]  They're gonna cross the middle plane.
[3439.38s -> 3440.58s]  You won't have to move very far from here
[3440.58s -> 3446.31s]  to get most of them.
[3446.31s -> 3453.82s]  You know what I'm saying?
[3453.82s -> 3455.10s]  Why did you instinctively point that?
[3455.10s -> 3455.94s]  I don't know.
[3455.94s -> 3460.93s]  I just was like, shoot this thing.
[3460.93s -> 3462.37s]  Always make sure you come right back to the middle
[3462.37s -> 3465.48s]  after every shot.
[3465.48s -> 3472.24s]  I was distracted by you.
[3472.24s -> 3475.43s]  Ooh, nutty buttercups.
[3475.43s -> 3482.65s]  All right.
[3482.65s -> 3484.12s]  What is this?
[3484.12s -> 3487.52s]  A carnival table?
[3488.32s -> 3489.16s]  Should I make a bunch of obstacles
[3489.16s -> 3492.57s]  so it takes them longer to get to the window?
[3492.57s -> 3494.05s]  See, I think that's a big mistake.
[3494.05s -> 3498.04s]  A lot of businesses that have lines,
[3498.04s -> 3504.42s]  there should be a handful of those mall toy stands
[3504.46s -> 3507.31s]  that have like the back flipping dog and shit.
[3507.31s -> 3510.35s]  Just give people just shit to do.
[3510.35s -> 3513.92s]  And put like kinetic sand samples over here.
[3513.92s -> 3517.07s]  You know what I'm saying?
[3517.07s -> 3527.23s]  And make that part of the line.
[3527.23s -> 3529.60s]  Time to hire some help.
[3529.60s -> 3532.80s]  Customers can now call to place orders for delivery.
[3532.80s -> 3534.40s]  You need to hire a driver to deliver the food.
[3534.40s -> 3572.13s]  All right, they can get delivery.
[3572.17s -> 3576.05s]  Should we give them hair?
[3576.05s -> 3578.01s]  Make Miku.
[3578.01s -> 3579.57s]  Why do you guys want me to put Miku
[3579.57s -> 3581.90s]  in every single video game?
[3581.90s -> 3589.14s]  Do you understand?
[3589.14s -> 3590.58s]  What does Miku's hair look like?
[3590.58s -> 3604.33s]  Why am I even entertaining this?
[3604.33s -> 3611.43s]  Where is it?
[3611.43s -> 3612.64s]  Like that?
[3612.64s -> 3615.62s]  No, it's like that.
[3615.62s -> 3616.58s]  Like that?
[3616.58s -> 3625.08s]  Like that, I don't, like this?
[3625.08s -> 3628.14s]  Like that?
[3628.14s -> 3630.84s]  This one?
[3630.84s -> 3632.67s]  This one.
[3632.67s -> 3639.43s]  Oh, wait.
[3639.43s -> 3644.48s]  What about the front?
[3644.48s -> 3647.14s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[3647.14s -> 3655.72s]  I got it, I got it.
[3655.72s -> 3662.73s]  This is close enough.
[3662.73s -> 3694.78s]  Okay, and we need, okay, I guess.
[3694.78s -> 3703.83s]  Correct, right?
[3703.83s -> 3711.05s]  That looks fine.
[3711.05s -> 3712.09s]  Can you change the eyebrow color?
[3712.09s -> 3714.91s]  I don't think so.
[3714.91s -> 3719.44s]  Different color, different color.
[3719.44s -> 3721.36s]  Like that?
[3721.36s -> 3722.20s]  What is closer?
[3722.20s -> 3723.32s]  It's this one then, isn't it?
[3723.32s -> 3724.16s]  Is it though?
[3724.16s -> 3725.73s]  I feel like it's not.
[3725.73s -> 3728.22s]  I don't, I feel like that's not correct.
[3728.22s -> 3734.74s]  No, that's too green.
[3734.74s -> 3738.68s]  Yeah, that's way too green.
[3738.68s -> 3742.43s]  This one's definitely closer.
[3742.43s -> 3746.35s]  Although maybe, it's between these two.
[3746.35s -> 3747.99s]  This one's too blue and this one's too green,
[3747.99s -> 3751.72s]  but we have to live with one of these.
[3751.72s -> 3759.04s]  I'm gonna keep this one.
[3759.04s -> 3763.57s]  Pull up an image, I got one right here.
[3763.57s -> 3767.25s]  In the mod chat, I got some help.
[3767.25s -> 3771.96s]  Okay, this is fine.
[3771.96s -> 3778.16s]  What about the neck?
[3778.16s -> 3788.16s]  That's not correct either.
[3788.16s -> 3796.13s]  Okay, it looks pretty good.
[3800.66s -> 3807.60s]  Longer neck, longer neck.
[3807.60s -> 3809.28s]  This is fine, this is fine.
[3809.28s -> 3810.28s]  This is fine, this is fine.
[3810.28s -> 3819.47s]  Okay, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[3819.47s -> 3823.19s]  Nevada, okay.
[3823.19s -> 3836.52s]  Strawberry wafer, all right, let's go.
[3836.52s -> 3841.71s]  Medium blended, blueberry, strawberry, strawberry.
[3841.71s -> 3844.67s]  I have to keep, okay, I'm putting these in a line
[3844.71s -> 3847.36s]  so I know that the first thing that I do is this one,
[3847.36s -> 3849.71s]  every time.
[3849.71s -> 3859.14s]  This is one in this descending order, strawberry.
[3859.14s -> 3865.73s]  All right, who's next?
[3865.73s -> 3867.68s]  I'm just gonna get one ready.
[3867.68s -> 3871.21s]  Should I pre-make?
[3871.21s -> 3873.79s]  Oh, hold on, hold on, telephone.
[3873.79s -> 3875.11s]  Your driver will take orders from customers
[3875.11s -> 3875.95s]  who call on the phone.
[3875.95s -> 3878.84s]  They'll also deliver the food to their home when it's ready.
[3878.84s -> 3882.28s]  Okay, you got it?
[3884.06s -> 3891.80s]  Marshmallow mint, go.
[3891.80s -> 3893.68s]  All right, this is the second order.
[3893.68s -> 3894.88s]  Two is in this slot.
[3900.32s -> 3901.64s]  Pico's working really hard.
[3901.64s -> 3906.16s]  Yeah, no, we're good.
[3906.16s -> 3908.64s]  All right, first one, I know I should do it the other way.
[3908.64s -> 3910.52s]  Other way around.
[3910.52s -> 3913.11s]  That's the plan.
[3913.11s -> 3921.21s]  That's way more efficient, that helps way more.
[3921.21s -> 3923.32s]  Let's go.
[3923.32s -> 3928.76s]  All right, we need strawberry whipped cream.
[3928.76s -> 3934.05s]  Coconut syrup.
[3934.05s -> 3941.57s]  These, the strawberry wafers, that.
[3941.57s -> 3954.28s]  This actually looks kind of good, just 100%.
[3954.28s -> 3957.39s]  All right, come on, hurry up.
[3957.39s -> 3959.11s]  I actually would much prefer you just scream this to me
[3959.11s -> 3968.40s]  when I'm in the back.
[3968.40s -> 3969.24s]  Where's Marshmallow's?
[3969.24s -> 3977.85s]  Oh, I got it, I got it.
[3977.85s -> 3982.63s]  Hurry up, I'm gonna get that phone.
[3982.63s -> 3984.81s]  Somebody get that phone.
[3984.81s -> 3987.83s]  Somebody get that phone.
[3987.83s -> 3992.11s]  You want to, okay.
[3992.11s -> 3993.31s]  What the hell are you ordering?
[3993.31s -> 4001.87s]  What was this?
[4001.87s -> 4009.28s]  You just walk in here in the sun?
[4009.28s -> 4014.09s]  All right, I gotta hurry up.
[4014.09s -> 4016.13s]  Get this off the screen, I can't see.
[4016.13s -> 4018.05s]  Stop telling me that I'm playing poorly
[4018.05s -> 4020.28s]  and just get off the screen.
[4020.28s -> 4022.67s]  Get off the screen.
[4022.67s -> 4030.11s]  Get off the screen.
[4030.11s -> 4037.40s]  I don't want the help page.
[4037.40s -> 4043.48s]  Throw this away.
[4043.48s -> 4046.40s]  All right, what, I was in the middle of something.
[4046.40s -> 4047.24s]  It's this one here, okay.
[4047.24s -> 4050.63s]  All right, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[4050.63s -> 4051.77s]  What am I missing?
[4051.77s -> 4065.01s]  Strawberry lemonade bullshit, all right.
[4065.01s -> 4068.08s]  All right, sounds good.
[4068.08s -> 4069.60s]  This one spinning, this one is this one.
[4069.60s -> 4074.98s]  I need the strawberry brownie quickly.
[4074.98s -> 4075.82s]  I don't even know how to make it,
[4075.82s -> 4082.60s]  so I'm gonna do this one first.
[4082.60s -> 4083.44s]  This one here.
[4083.44s -> 4087.82s]  All right, strawberry brownie is brownie.
[4087.82s -> 4091.00s]  No shit.
[4091.00s -> 4094.29s]  Who would have thought?
[4094.29s -> 4100.76s]  And then strawberry, shit, all right.
[4100.76s -> 4108.86s]  All right, we're good.
[4108.86s -> 4118.47s]  This is coming off first.
[4118.47s -> 4126.27s]  Okay, we need this.
[4126.27s -> 4127.67s]  I know people are mad that I didn't give anybody
[4128.23s -> 4137.78s]  the strawberry syrup, but I know.
[4137.78s -> 4143.88s]  Pretty happy.
[4143.88s -> 4145.72s]  This is, which one is this?
[4145.72s -> 4146.68s]  This one?
[4146.68s -> 4148.80s]  All right, go, go, go, go, go, quick.
[4148.80s -> 4151.20s]  I'll get all these out at the same time.
[4151.20s -> 4155.23s]  Peanuts and then a cherry.
[4155.23s -> 4156.27s]  Very easy order.
[4158.08s -> 4163.06s]  Very easy, good.
[4163.06s -> 4169.87s]  Almost perfect.
[4169.87s -> 4173.35s]  All right, now this is chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup.
[4173.35s -> 4175.69s]  Wait, what's going on?
[4175.69s -> 4189.12s]  Yep, good.
[4189.12s -> 4193.64s]  Now the last bits are chocolate chips
[4193.64s -> 4204.31s]  and three cherries, perfectly placed.
[4204.31s -> 4205.39s]  This is so much sugar.
[4205.39s -> 4225.60s]  Yeah, this is like 4,000 calories.
[4225.60s -> 4229.07s]  That's a lot of calories.
[4229.07s -> 4234.91s]  Marshmallow Pro, blender ball.
[4234.91s -> 4235.95s]  There's a lot of these little mini games.
[4235.95s -> 4243.06s]  I like these.
[4243.06s -> 4247.16s]  Am I at max power?
[4247.16s -> 4252.30s]  I just won the game.
[4252.30s -> 4271.77s]  Okay, what?
[4271.77s -> 4279.73s]  Food truck free play.
[4279.73s -> 4291.37s]  Looks good.
[4291.37s -> 4300.37s]  Is that the parade?
[4300.37s -> 4301.29s]  The food truck is the best shit
[4301.29s -> 4304.06s]  in the most recent mobile game.
[4304.06s -> 4320.31s]  I'll check it out.
[4320.31s -> 4323.71s]  I left the parade.
[4323.71s -> 4329.28s]  I got work to do.
[4329.28s -> 4330.24s]  I haven't seen any stickers.
[4330.24s -> 4333.21s]  All right, let's go.
[4333.21s -> 4342.96s]  Oh, I wanted to do the free play.
[4342.96s -> 4346.41s]  Wally.
[4346.41s -> 4348.65s]  I'll take a medium blended blueberry
[4348.65s -> 4349.89s]  with some strawberries,
[4349.89s -> 4352.65s]  some whipped cream with the blue in it
[4352.65s -> 4356.57s]  and then also would like some plum and some peanuts please.
[4356.57s -> 4371.94s]  Thank you.
[4371.94s -> 4380.00s]  That's it?
[4380.00s -> 4382.65s]  I can sit right here.
[4382.65s -> 4386.32s]  I look like I'm in a costume.
[4386.32s -> 4387.92s]  Some days your dining room will be open
[4387.92s -> 4389.76s]  and your driver will take orders from customers
[4389.76s -> 4392.36s]  who are dining instead of delivering orders.
[4392.36s -> 4394.60s]  Oh, they actually come sit down.
[4394.60s -> 4397.50s]  Okay.
[4397.50s -> 4399.34s]  Do you want Oreo cookie?
[4399.38s -> 4400.38s]  All right, Oreos.
[4402.19s -> 4403.03s]  How blended is this?
[4403.03s -> 4404.89s]  I think we're good.
[4404.89s -> 4407.46s]  Chocolate.
[4407.46s -> 4409.47s]  Put that up there.
[4409.47s -> 4411.07s]  How we doing?
[4411.07s -> 4417.72s]  Good.
[4417.72s -> 4418.56s]  That one actually sounds pretty good.
[4418.56s -> 4433.52s]  It does, yeah.
[4433.52s -> 4440.08s]  Yeah, I'm taking it.
[4440.08s -> 4442.42s]  Okay.
[4442.42s -> 4444.02s]  This is still blending.
[4444.02s -> 4444.86s]  Get this out of the way.
[4444.86s -> 4447.68s]  This one is the one I need to be focusing on.
[4447.68s -> 4448.68s]  So we need...
[4450.64s -> 4451.48s]  God damn it.
[4451.48s -> 4455.73s]  Whatever, fine.
[4455.73s -> 4459.17s]  This looks good too.
[4459.17s -> 4461.73s]  I can't remember the last time I actually had
[4461.97s -> 4466.24s]  a wacky, wild-ass ice cream.
[4466.24s -> 4469.69s]  I would consider this to be a wacky-ass ice cream.
[4469.69s -> 4471.41s]  There's a ton of different flavors and toppings
[4471.41s -> 4480.93s]  and it's been a very long time.
[4480.93s -> 4487.91s]  Things are definitely done by now.
[4487.91s -> 4492.38s]  All right, you wanted this.
[4492.38s -> 4496.27s]  Chocolate.
[4496.27s -> 4500.43s]  White chocolate does get a pretty bad rap, doesn't it?
[4500.43s -> 4501.91s]  I think it makes sense in some places,
[4501.91s -> 4505.10s]  but I really just don't like it in a lot of places.
[4505.10s -> 4506.46s]  How did I backtrack that before you guys
[4506.46s -> 4508.22s]  even yelled at me about it?
[4508.22s -> 4509.38s]  That was interesting.
[4516.00s -> 4533.05s]  87% cake.
[4533.05s -> 4534.91s]  All right, the hardest thing to make
[4534.91s -> 4535.75s]  in the whole restaurant.
[4535.75s -> 4538.67s]  Okay, let's go.
[4538.67s -> 4539.51s]  I gotta memorize this.
[4539.51s -> 4542.11s]  And then it's brownie, strawberry.
[4546.65s -> 4547.53s]  Another person just came in.
[4547.53s -> 4549.41s]  All right, it's strawberry.
[4549.41s -> 4550.81s]  All right, all right, all right.
[4550.81s -> 4554.52s]  What do you want?
[4554.52s -> 4557.17s]  White chocolate is usually good for two bites.
[4557.17s -> 4561.76s]  Yeah, it's fine.
[4561.76s -> 4572.12s]  It's fine.
[4572.12s -> 4582.76s]  All right, the system is working.
[4582.76s -> 4584.72s]  Please make a funny drink.
[4584.72s -> 4589.95s]  Okay, I'll make a funny one.
[4589.95s -> 4591.71s]  I wanna at least make enough money.
[4604.12s -> 4607.75s]  Cherry, and we're good.
[4607.75s -> 4615.47s]  Now get out of here.
[4615.47s -> 4617.61s]  Tropical treat?
[4617.61s -> 4619.05s]  Well, you took me too long
[4619.05s -> 4622.47s]  for telling me about my new tropical treat.
[4622.47s -> 4624.33s]  All right, what the hell is on this?
[4624.33s -> 4627.44s]  It's this, too late.
[4635.68s -> 4636.92s]  Then it's three brownie.
[4636.92s -> 4644.40s]  Ah, it's even more bullshit.
[4644.40s -> 4655.80s]  Come on, we're good.
[4655.80s -> 4660.53s]  Take it off.
[4660.53s -> 4662.74s]  Is there really a complaint though?
[4662.74s -> 4665.50s]  My blended ice cream was blended too much.
[4667.70s -> 4668.54s]  Doesn't it hit a point
[4668.54s -> 4672.93s]  where it doesn't blend at all anymore?
[4672.93s -> 4675.37s]  How would you even tell that?
[4675.37s -> 4683.09s]  It's just because it gets soupy?
[4683.09s -> 4686.21s]  31%, you did one really unhappy.
[4686.21s -> 4704.94s]  It's really soupy.
[4704.94s -> 4709.61s]  Don't overmix.
[4709.61s -> 4711.77s]  I like these mini games.
[4711.77s -> 4715.12s]  Slider escape, okay.
[4715.12s -> 4719.68s]  Slide the burger slider towards the goal.
[4719.68s -> 4722.68s]  Oh, it's one of these.
[4722.68s -> 4726.17s]  If only it has to move the whole way into the wall.
[4739.01s -> 4743.36s]  Got it.
[4743.36s -> 4744.82s]  He's not gonna make it?
[4744.82s -> 4760.16s]  Well, I already did.
[4760.16s -> 4764.32s]  I got it.
[4764.32s -> 4766.47s]  All right, I'm rank five.
[4766.47s -> 4767.31s]  New special.
[4767.31s -> 4770.32s]  All right, I wanna do the tropical treat.
[4770.32s -> 4776.08s]  I would probably like this.
[4776.08s -> 4779.89s]  Yeah, just put a bunch of shit everywhere.
[4779.89s -> 4783.51s]  Stickers.
[4783.51s -> 4785.99s]  You can now send your driver out in a food truck
[4785.99s -> 4795.52s]  between work days to make any food you choose, okay?
[4795.52s -> 4797.20s]  Customers won't place any orders at the food truck.
[4797.20s -> 4801.39s]  Just make whatever you like and see who shows up to buy it.
[4801.39s -> 4803.07s]  Oh, all right, let's go.
[4803.07s -> 4804.43s]  I'm gonna make my favorite.
[4804.43s -> 4806.79s]  This is exactly what I would be doing.
[4806.83s -> 4810.72s]  All right, bingo.
[4810.72s -> 4826.86s]  Oreo, moon, not blended at all.
[4826.86s -> 4828.94s]  Look at that, lightly blended.
[4828.94s -> 4834.36s]  Still tons of chunks.
[4834.36s -> 4837.60s]  And if it were me, I'm topping this
[4837.60s -> 4839.32s]  with a little bit of regular whipped cream,
[4839.32s -> 4841.27s]  just a tiny bit.
[4841.27s -> 4845.83s]  Well, nevermind.
[4845.83s -> 4855.68s]  And then a little bit of chocolate at the end
[4855.68s -> 4857.64s]  and really give him something to take a picture of.
[4857.64s -> 4861.31s]  You know what I mean?
[4861.31s -> 4863.19s]  Yeah, I'm the only guy in town
[4863.19s -> 4869.43s]  that gives you a whole sleeve of Oreos as part of it.
[4869.43s -> 4889.66s]  By the way, this shit's only fucking $4.
[4889.70s -> 4896.42s]  Holy shit, it's awesome.
[4896.42s -> 4900.52s]  Okay, hold on.
[4900.52s -> 4904.24s]  Can I change the flavor of ice cream?
[4904.24s -> 4908.03s]  No, how about just plain?
[4908.03s -> 4914.49s]  Oh, can I just do plain soft serve?
[4914.49s -> 4922.15s]  Marshmallow, marshmallow, banana, blend that.
[4922.15s -> 4923.11s]  And you know what?
[4923.11s -> 4924.23s]  Check this out.
[4924.23s -> 4928.52s]  Blend the fuck out of that.
[4928.52s -> 4930.96s]  Oh, my mouth is already salivating.
[4930.96s -> 4944.44s]  My mouth is watering.
[4944.44s -> 4963.28s]  I wouldn't do anything else to this.
[4963.28s -> 4968.91s]  Look at that.
[4968.91s -> 4973.89s]  That was 100%.
[4973.89s -> 4975.49s]  Don't have to make ice cream again.
[4977.74s -> 4981.22s]  That would be amazing.
[4981.22s -> 4982.58s]  All right, we have to make a Miku shake.
[4982.58s -> 4984.97s]  All right, we're gonna do blueberry.
[4984.97s -> 4988.13s]  And then the moon sauce.
[4988.13s -> 4994.58s]  We're gonna go right in the middle here.
[4994.58s -> 5000.68s]  This Miku, whatever, Miku branded, okay.
[5000.76s -> 5015.50s]  And then this, and then this.
[5015.50s -> 5017.40s]  Look at that.
[5017.40s -> 5028.86s]  And that's it.
[5028.86s -> 5031.16s]  That's a full 100.
[5031.16s -> 5033.26s]  Cool.
[5033.26s -> 5042.19s]  Okay, now let's do something dumb.
[5042.19s -> 5055.76s]  Cake, lemonade, lightly blended.
[5055.76s -> 5062.88s]  And then strawberry whipped cream.
[5062.88s -> 5064.80s]  I can't add any more strawberry, wait, I can.
[5064.80s -> 5067.64s]  All right, no, I can't.
[5072.28s -> 5076.11s]  And sprinkles.
[5076.11s -> 5087.36s]  And this has to be a joke how much sprinkles are on it.
[5087.36s -> 5100.96s]  How many can you actually put?
[5100.96s -> 5105.80s]  A lot?
[5105.80s -> 5117.42s]  How much is a lot?
[5117.42s -> 5119.36s]  Skip two hours?
[5119.36s -> 5125.78s]  Vod watchers?
[5125.78s -> 5145.13s]  It's unlimited?
[5145.13s -> 5145.97s]  I don't think this is,
[5145.97s -> 5156.24s]  I think it's replacing them at some point.
[5156.24s -> 5157.08s]  I don't even think it's,
[5157.08s -> 5176.19s]  I think it's just kind of coloring over them.
[5176.19s -> 5181.36s]  What do you think?
[5181.36s -> 5188.04s]  A little too much on the toppings, but that's all right.
[5188.04s -> 5188.88s]  All right, last one.
[5188.88s -> 5203.84s]  This is gonna be called the triple strawberry.
[5203.84s -> 5207.54s]  Oh guys, we're making a triple strawberry.
[5207.54s -> 5245.18s]  Look.
[5245.18s -> 5246.30s]  Okay, I need to,
[5246.30s -> 5251.78s]  there needs to be like ace, king, king, ace, two.
[5251.78s -> 5265.57s]  I want it to be like card themed or something.
[5265.57s -> 5269.66s]  That's fun.
[5269.66s -> 5274.25s]  That would be a goofy ass shake.
[5274.25s -> 5280.17s]  Cool.
[5280.17s -> 5282.07s]  It's payday.
[5282.07s -> 5286.41s]  Go.
[5286.41s -> 5291.68s]  Large cup has been at, oh.
[5291.68s -> 5294.59s]  That's my favorite dessert ever.
[5294.59s -> 5299.17s]  People sleep on s'mores so much and it's infuriating to me.
[5299.17s -> 5301.13s]  Like that is the greatest kind of dessert.
[5301.13s -> 5302.29s]  It is, people just sleep on it.
[5302.29s -> 5310.15s]  It's like so hard to, you know, it's annoying to me.
[5310.15s -> 5314.04s]  Okay, this is a large.
[5314.04s -> 5316.92s]  This is a large s'mores.
[5316.92s -> 5330.22s]  Ooh, that's probably so good.
[5330.22s -> 5333.07s]  S'mores are amazing.
[5333.07s -> 5333.91s]  I mean, I get it.
[5333.91s -> 5336.80s]  S'mores are a pain in the ass to make.
[5336.80s -> 5339.25s]  They're kind of messy and they're kind of annoying,
[5339.25s -> 5341.17s]  but I think they're the best dessert.
[5341.17s -> 5343.36s]  One of the best at least.
[5343.36s -> 5347.37s]  Especially fresh.
[5347.37s -> 5363.50s]  That is a medium.
[5363.50s -> 5368.64s]  I made s'mores in my dorm room with a candle.
[5368.64s -> 5371.12s]  Dude, you gotta be careful, man.
[5371.12s -> 5372.24s]  With a candle?
[5374.57s -> 5375.99s]  Come on.
[5375.99s -> 5377.27s]  Why?
[5377.27s -> 5378.55s]  All right, wait, don't distract me.
[5378.55s -> 5382.12s]  This is important.
[5382.12s -> 5383.00s]  I'll take your order in a second.
[5383.00s -> 5393.80s]  We gotta do this one.
[5393.80s -> 5396.64s]  Peanuts, all right, you lost me with the peanuts.
[5396.64s -> 5414.52s]  Everything else here is perfect.
[5414.52s -> 5415.36s]  S'mores.
[5416.32s -> 5418.48s]  I gotta take an order here in a second,
[5418.48s -> 5420.88s]  but I don't want it to overblend.
[5420.88s -> 5427.05s]  Go ahead and do this.
[5427.05s -> 5430.11s]  No, no, I honestly, peanuts.
[5430.11s -> 5432.19s]  I feel like that's very divided.
[5432.19s -> 5434.91s]  I think a lot of people really don't like
[5434.91s -> 5447.12s]  nuts on their dessert.
[5447.12s -> 5448.12s]  You want a tropical treat.
[5448.16s -> 5449.00s]  You want the hard shit.
[5449.00s -> 5450.24s]  All right, hold on, I gotta,
[5450.24s -> 5451.93s]  and this got all screwed up.
[5451.93s -> 5459.27s]  Why did you move this?
[5459.27s -> 5461.38s]  Blueberries?
[5461.38s -> 5463.48s]  This looks kinda good.
[5463.48s -> 5472.23s]  Blueberry cream is really good.
[5472.23s -> 5474.63s]  Pecans are literally the only S tier ice cream topping.
[5474.63s -> 5487.48s]  I, no, no, I disagree.
[5487.48s -> 5488.88s]  All right, what is this tropical treat?
[5488.88s -> 5491.80s]  It's blueberry lemonade.
[5491.80s -> 5493.32s]  Is this a large or a small?
[5493.32s -> 5495.49s]  Medium.
[5495.49s -> 5502.94s]  Blueberry lemonade.
[5502.94s -> 5504.58s]  That thing up there, this is the tropical,
[5504.58s -> 5509.44s]  I'm gonna separate these.
[5509.44s -> 5517.25s]  Any nuts, really, I don't really like on ice cream.
[5517.25s -> 5521.77s]  All right, this is a medium,
[5521.77s -> 5531.24s]  rubber banana, good combo.
[5531.24s -> 5533.20s]  I kinda did these two close to each other, I think,
[5533.20s -> 5534.44s]  because I'm gonna mess it up.
[5534.44s -> 5541.97s]  But we'll try to get this one fast.
[5541.97s -> 5550.47s]  So I need blue whipped cream, blue sauce,
[5550.47s -> 5553.63s]  blue whipped cream, sauce,
[5553.63s -> 5559.79s]  wait, wrong one, coconut sprinkles.
[5561.81s -> 5567.63s]  Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[5567.63s -> 5579.46s]  So much shit on this one.
[5579.46s -> 5582.81s]  All right, hurry up, hurry up.
[5582.85s -> 5583.93s]  I'm wasting time.
[5586.04s -> 5590.29s]  Uh-oh, um, uh-oh.
[5590.29s -> 5593.92s]  Oh shit, how do I, what just happened?
[5593.92s -> 5595.40s]  Where's the other one?
[5595.40s -> 5597.00s]  Which one is this?
[5597.00s -> 5598.00s]  Okay, I need this.
[5598.00s -> 5602.78s]  Which one is this one?
[5602.78s -> 5609.88s]  What just happened?
[5609.88s -> 5628.85s]  Okay, it's in the queue, all right, good.
[5628.85s -> 5638.53s]  Pretty bad, but it's all right.
[5638.53s -> 5642.86s]  Good, it was an easy one.
[5642.86s -> 5650.36s]  Placement's pretty dog shit on that, but it's all right.
[5650.36s -> 5653.40s]  What's my favorite topping?
[5653.40s -> 5654.52s]  Is it weird that I can't answer that
[5654.52s -> 5656.48s]  because I haven't had an ice cream like this
[5656.48s -> 5658.97s]  in a very long time?
[5658.97s -> 5663.22s]  I forgot what all this tastes like.
[5663.22s -> 5665.60s]  I like blended up Oreo cookie.
[5665.60s -> 5667.40s]  Cookies and cream is one of my favorites,
[5667.40s -> 5673.73s]  but that's not really a topping.
[5673.73s -> 5678.04s]  Customer cravings, I got six tickets.
[5678.04s -> 5679.92s]  What is it?
[5679.92s -> 5684.43s]  I don't know, I think it's this one.
[5684.43s -> 5686.47s]  I have to remember orders.
[5686.47s -> 5692.70s]  Marty Grave.
[5697.46s -> 5699.18s]  I don't know, we haven't even served him.
[5699.18s -> 5706.76s]  This is a new item.
[5706.76s -> 5716.68s]  Oh, I got a new flooring.
[5716.68s -> 5718.70s]  It's Mitch Grave.
[5718.70s -> 5723.25s]  I'm pretty sure it's this one.
[5723.25s -> 5726.61s]  I think Mitch orders the blue whipped cream.
[5731.04s -> 5732.88s]  I believe this is s'mores over here
[5732.88s -> 5736.08s]  and this is Oreo cookie over here.
[5736.08s -> 5744.28s]  I got this, okay.
[5747.91s -> 5750.79s]  Yep, this is you like this and you want this.
[5753.40s -> 5756.90s]  There's usually a ton of stuff on, he's cheating?
[5756.90s -> 5758.70s]  There's not even enough time for you to tell me who did it.
[5758.70s -> 5761.08s]  There's a delay on this to the stream.
[5761.08s -> 5767.59s]  All right, you, it's, wait, who is this one?
[5767.59s -> 5768.67s]  You want one of these.
[5768.67s -> 5770.07s]  I think it's this one here.
[5772.41s -> 5773.57s]  So I missed one.
[5773.57s -> 5812.13s]  Oh no, I got a bunch of new furniture.
[5812.13s -> 5827.15s]  This place fucking sucks.
[5827.15s -> 5849.01s]  I get points for these being here though.
[5849.01s -> 5850.98s]  That's not as horrible.
[5850.98s -> 5852.75s]  This thing is so ugly.
[5852.75s -> 5857.36s]  I don't even know what to do with this.
[5857.36s -> 5859.32s]  Maybe put this in the very beginning.
[5859.32s -> 5861.44s]  It's like, oh look, checkpoint, you've made it into the,
[5861.44s -> 5864.52s]  yeah, I could do some really, yeah.
[5864.52s -> 5866.36s]  Oh, checkpoint, you made it into the restaurant.
[5866.36s -> 5868.12s]  So here you are, you've made it.
[5868.12s -> 5869.40s]  I think that's like a funny little cute thing
[5869.40s -> 5873.77s]  to have at the front door.
[5873.77s -> 5876.80s]  Checkpoint.
[5876.80s -> 5884.36s]  They walk by it and it goes like,
[5884.36s -> 5886.50s]  that should tide them over a little bit
[5886.50s -> 5889.07s]  when they get to like the 50 person line
[5889.07s -> 5891.83s]  and they forget to have looked at the Yelp score
[5891.83s -> 5896.59s]  for this restaurant and it's like a two out of fucking five.
[5896.59s -> 5898.35s]  Bring, bring, look, come on in.
[5913.98s -> 5916.08s]  Why are you so patronizing?
[5916.08s -> 5931.13s]  And why did I just go like this?
[5931.13s -> 5932.53s]  I'm definitely getting older.
[5932.53s -> 5941.35s]  I just, and you know, I can just tell.
[5941.35s -> 5943.35s]  I'm kind of getting old guy voice.
[5943.35s -> 5944.19s]  I'm getting old.
[5944.19s -> 5945.75s]  My voice is turning into an old guy voice.
[5945.75s -> 5947.42s]  It just is.
[5947.42s -> 5948.26s]  And I'm okay with it.
[5948.26s -> 5950.76s]  I don't really don't care.
[5950.76s -> 5963.80s]  Strawberry, where's, nope.
[5963.80s -> 5968.92s]  Got permanent milk voice, kind of.
[5968.92s -> 5970.24s]  Hi, you want medium?
[5980.85s -> 5984.16s]  I am gonna wait to put this up here.
[5984.16s -> 5989.76s]  Actually looks kinda good.
[5989.76s -> 5998.70s]  Okay, now, now I'll put it up.
[5998.70s -> 6001.32s]  Come on in.
[6001.32s -> 6003.84s]  Why are you so patronizing?
[6003.84s -> 6008.80s]  Bring, oh, welcome.
[6008.80s -> 6010.56s]  Patronizing, who?
[6010.56s -> 6012.52s]  There is a, who am I patronizing with that?
[6012.52s -> 6016.84s]  I've never seen a like Mario checkpoint flag
[6016.84s -> 6018.28s]  at the beginning of any restaurant.
[6018.28s -> 6020.24s]  This is not a real place.
[6020.24s -> 6022.28s]  All right, hold on.
[6022.28s -> 6023.12s]  What was it?
[6023.12s -> 6028.07s]  This is large.
[6028.07s -> 6029.81s]  Check the blend.
[6029.81s -> 6031.49s]  This is why I fucking always gotta check
[6031.49s -> 6033.89s]  the goddamn blend first before I do anything.
[6051.91s -> 6054.60s]  Hey, go, go, go, go, go.
[6054.60s -> 6061.68s]  No, that was wrong.
[6061.68s -> 6065.22s]  You need a blend alarm.
[6065.22s -> 6066.54s]  I need to focus.
[6068.41s -> 6072.34s]  I didn't even, why did I just do that?
[6072.34s -> 6076.24s]  Take it off.
[6076.24s -> 6081.43s]  What the hell do you want?
[6081.43s -> 6089.74s]  Okay, and this.
[6089.74s -> 6092.02s]  I gotta start styling it up a little more like that.
[6092.06s -> 6094.86s]  That's like cool.
[6094.86s -> 6097.01s]  Peanuts on the left.
[6097.01s -> 6113.28s]  Dunk, I just blended a little too much.
[6113.28s -> 6119.48s]  All right, this is a large and you wanted Reese's chocolate.
[6120.85s -> 6122.93s]  Get this on a blender.
[6122.93s -> 6124.33s]  We need a tropical treat.
[6124.33s -> 6127.01s]  Tropical treat, I believe is medium, right?
[6127.01s -> 6129.95s]  Yep.
[6129.95s -> 6133.95s]  Food critic has arrived.
[6133.95s -> 6140.53s]  Okay, I don't care about anybody else's order.
[6140.53s -> 6141.37s]  This is a medium.
[6142.93s -> 6147.23s]  No, wait, this is a test.
[6147.23s -> 6152.68s]  Sorry, sir, you're gonna have to wait.
[6152.68s -> 6153.52s]  Oh, he waited.
[6153.52s -> 6154.80s]  He's making me, there's another customer.
[6157.94s -> 6158.78s]  Strawberry.
[6164.44s -> 6167.67s]  Is this the critics?
[6167.67s -> 6168.63s]  I'm gonna wait till this is ready,
[6168.63s -> 6169.91s]  although I'll start to blend on this one.
[6169.91s -> 6173.76s]  It's a medium.
[6173.76s -> 6177.26s]  Cake and chocolate.
[6177.26s -> 6180.20s]  Perfect.
[6180.20s -> 6181.53s]  Perfect.
[6181.53s -> 6184.63s]  Put it up there.
[6184.63s -> 6195.50s]  Good.
[6195.50s -> 6196.90s]  It's cookie, cherry, cookie.
[6207.33s -> 6208.48s]  Good.
[6208.48s -> 6211.80s]  All right.
[6211.80s -> 6213.32s]  All right, we still got plenty of time.
[6213.32s -> 6218.84s]  First up is whipped cream, coconut sauce, sprinkles.
[6218.84s -> 6226.02s]  Whipped cream, coconut sauce, lucky charms.
[6226.02s -> 6228.97s]  Coconut sauce, lucky charms,
[6228.97s -> 6242.80s]  and then there's something else on it.
[6242.80s -> 6243.64s]  Go.
[6243.64s -> 6249.08s]  All right, perfect timing.
[6249.08s -> 6252.40s]  Good, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6252.40s -> 6253.24s]  No!
[6255.96s -> 6260.70s]  Hey, hey, can you come back tomorrow?
[6260.70s -> 6262.94s]  No, honestly, at this point, I'm sorry.
[6262.94s -> 6265.74s]  At this point, I have a stuffed squirrel in the back,
[6265.74s -> 6267.36s]  like a stuffed animal squirrel,
[6267.36s -> 6270.12s]  and I just run out, holding it against my neck,
[6270.12s -> 6273.40s]  like, God, just give me the squirrel,
[6273.40s -> 6275.12s]  and I pump like fucking squirrel,
[6275.12s -> 6279.80s]  like yippee, yippee, the sound effects through the PA.
[6279.80s -> 6284.71s]  I'm sorry, you're gonna come back tomorrow.
[6284.75s -> 6286.51s]  Gym carrier routine.
[6286.51s -> 6288.79s]  Yeah, but I mean, at some point,
[6288.79s -> 6292.97s]  I gotta check the business here.
[6292.97s -> 6293.81s]  Make another one?
[6293.81s -> 6295.13s]  He's been waiting for too long already.
[6295.13s -> 6307.29s]  No, I can't.
[6307.29s -> 6308.13s]  This is fine.
[6308.13s -> 6313.06s]  It's a little blended, but who cares?
[6313.06s -> 6316.40s]  We got the blue ribbon, we're fine.
[6316.40s -> 6318.00s]  But there would be a squirrel in your restaurant.
[6318.00s -> 6323.01s]  Wouldn't that be worse?
[6323.01s -> 6325.33s]  No, dude, you have to plan it.
[6325.33s -> 6327.05s]  So I have to come out to the,
[6327.05s -> 6330.17s]  all right, I've gotta come out to the lobby,
[6330.17s -> 6331.69s]  be like, oh, I'm just checking to make sure
[6331.69s -> 6333.41s]  everyone's doing all right.
[6333.41s -> 6335.69s]  God, it's a little stuffy in here.
[6335.69s -> 6337.97s]  And I open up one of the windows,
[6337.97s -> 6341.32s]  like, and I have somebody throw
[6341.32s -> 6343.16s]  the stuffed animal squirrel through the window,
[6343.16s -> 6345.28s]  and I grab it, holding my neck with it,
[6345.28s -> 6365.55s]  and start running around the circle.
[6365.55s -> 6379.77s]  Oh, let me 100% this real quick.
[6379.77s -> 6381.81s]  That sounds like a Disney Channel sitcom.
[6389.64s -> 6393.00s]  Are we sure that didn't happen on like Sweet Life on Deck?
[6393.00s -> 6395.96s]  That may have, that may have happened.
[6395.96s -> 6409.78s]  That actually might be a plot from that show.
[6409.78s -> 6419.48s]  Shit, God damn, this is hard.
[6419.48s -> 6423.21s]  Ooh, I got a sticker.
[6423.25s -> 6444.47s]  Ooh, did I actually get one?
[6444.47s -> 6446.39s]  All right, chunky alarm.
[6446.39s -> 6453.06s]  Set this alarm for when Sundays are blended to chunky.
[6453.06s -> 6455.94s]  Hold down the booster to blend Sundays faster.
[6455.94s -> 6459.57s]  That's kind of good.
[6459.57s -> 6460.89s]  I feel like it's this one,
[6460.89s -> 6469.14s]  because most of them are coming through like this.
[6469.14s -> 6473.17s]  Okay, and then maybe the first level of this,
[6473.17s -> 6481.43s]  I can speed it up, and then send one
[6481.43s -> 6488.56s]  to a specific customer to get them to visit again.
[6488.56s -> 6496.67s]  Um, I'll get these two, why not?
[6496.67s -> 6503.59s]  So I'm imagining those are just installed, right?
[6503.63s -> 6507.26s]  Now celebrating Starlight Jubilee.
[6507.26s -> 6517.53s]  New customer, boomer, pomegranate, mulberry medley?
[6524.58s -> 6526.06s]  You earned a blue ribbon for the next three days,
[6526.06s -> 6527.38s]  customers will give better tips.
[6527.38s -> 6540.31s]  Ooh, all right, what even is that?
[6540.31s -> 6542.28s]  This is medium.
[6542.28s -> 6552.16s]  That's bad, throw it away quick.
[6552.16s -> 6562.40s]  What if it's this thing?
[6562.40s -> 6571.36s]  Hold down to boost button.
[6571.36s -> 6572.84s]  Oreo cookie, strawberry, chocolate.
[6572.84s -> 6582.28s]  That's, I guess it's not that bad.
[6582.28s -> 6592.67s]  I have the alarm set, right?
[6592.67s -> 6595.41s]  Tap a blend alarm, okay, yeah, there's the alarm.
[6595.41s -> 6611.56s]  Speed this up.
[6611.56s -> 6614.20s]  All right, good.
[6614.20s -> 6621.52s]  What is the max level in this game anyways?
[6621.52s -> 6624.72s]  And then pomegranate shakes?
[6624.72s -> 6626.16s]  Those pomegranate seeds?
[6626.16s -> 6628.32s]  I would, on ice cream?
[6629.88s -> 6642.76s]  I feel like that'd be kind of annoying.
[6642.76s -> 6655.15s]  I can do it quick.
[6655.15s -> 6659.68s]  Okay, you wanted this.
[6659.68s -> 6667.60s]  Syrup on there, this on there.
[6667.60s -> 6673.93s]  Chocolate chips, and then almost good.
[6673.93s -> 6682.10s]  Max level's 100.
[6682.10s -> 6687.10s]  They give extra tips today.
[6687.10s -> 6691.28s]  It's almost 10 bucks.
[6691.28s -> 6692.56s]  Do I have anything blending yet?
[6692.56s -> 6693.40s]  What did you want?
[6693.40s -> 6697.05s]  All right, all right, we got two mediums.
[6697.05s -> 6699.01s]  Get them up there.
[6699.01s -> 6704.19s]  Want these, I don't even know what these are supposed to be.
[6704.19s -> 6715.86s]  Those are supposed to be like Mike and Ikes.
[6715.86s -> 6727.32s]  This is blueberry, strawberry.
[6727.32s -> 6728.60s]  Where's my comedy milkshake?
[6728.60s -> 6737.26s]  Oh, you missed it, I did it in the food truck.
[6737.26s -> 6740.28s]  The wrong syrup.
[6740.28s -> 6759.63s]  What, wrong?
[6759.63s -> 6766.06s]  Yeah, I know, hold on.
[6766.06s -> 6770.18s]  It's lemonade, not strawberry.
[6770.18s -> 6771.78s]  Pink pomegranate, okay, cool.
[6774.02s -> 6778.93s]  A large Reese's chocolate.
[6778.93s -> 6784.92s]  This is not a bad one, this is easy.
[6784.96s -> 6786.72s]  Okay, that's a tropical treat.
[6786.72s -> 6787.56s]  I gotta hurry up with this one.
[6787.56s -> 6795.91s]  So it's, oh, right, I screwed it up, it's fine.
[6795.91s -> 6801.08s]  Again, large.
[6801.08s -> 6802.68s]  It's Reese's, it's Reese's.
[6811.00s -> 6825.17s]  Oh, all right, banana cake.
[6825.17s -> 6830.78s]  Banana cake, strawberry.
[6830.78s -> 6835.96s]  How's that not perfect?
[6835.96s -> 6840.68s]  This is the tropical one, right?
[6840.68s -> 6841.52s]  All right, what is this?
[6841.52s -> 6845.60s]  Okay, it's whipped cream, coconut syrup,
[6845.60s -> 6846.72s]  and then sprinkles.
[6855.00s -> 6858.17s]  Good.
[6858.17s -> 6863.82s]  They had to wait a long time, but it's all right.
[6863.82s -> 6867.23s]  We should be fine.
[6868.50s -> 6888.92s]  Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[6888.92s -> 6894.64s]  Close as this one, all right, just get it off.
[6894.64s -> 6895.48s]  Who's been waiting longer?
[6895.48s -> 6903.09s]  You have, okay, let's go.
[6903.09s -> 6913.16s]  Oreo, carry Oreo.
[6913.16s -> 6916.34s]  That was a tuber reaction?
[6916.34s -> 6927.22s]  Yeah, that's true.
[6927.22s -> 6929.75s]  Nothing but just toppings, all right.
[6929.75s -> 6933.41s]  Toppings, I hate that word.
[6933.41s -> 6938.04s]  Ooh, toppings, something about it.
[6938.04s -> 6939.08s]  I just don't like it.
[6955.32s -> 6963.15s]  Toppings.
[6963.15s -> 6964.35s]  Hey, those of you criticizing
[6964.35s -> 6965.47s]  that I'm not playing the game right,
[6965.47s -> 6969.29s]  I've got a 98% service quality right now.
[6969.81s -> 6990.74s]  I'm doing pretty fine right now.
[6990.74s -> 6993.69s]  What's going on here?
[6993.69s -> 6994.93s]  What's going on here?
[6994.93s -> 6997.47s]  Wait, I don't have to use them all?
[6997.47s -> 6999.54s]  What's going on here?
[6999.54s -> 7015.16s]  I thought I had to use all the pieces.
[7015.16s -> 7016.60s]  What is actually going on right now?
[7016.60s -> 7020.06s]  I'm confused, what does it want me to do?
[7020.06s -> 7034.58s]  I don't understand.
[7034.58s -> 7036.92s]  Wait, really?
[7036.92s -> 7040.98s]  Wait, what's going on right now?
[7040.98s -> 7052.48s]  I have to, what the hell was that?
[7052.48s -> 7053.72s]  Performance IQ.
[7053.72s -> 7055.20s]  No, I didn't know what,
[7056.56s -> 7057.72s]  they don't give you very much time to be like,
[7057.72s -> 7061.54s]  oh, by the way, you have to connect everything.
[7061.54s -> 7067.66s]  Good luck.
[7067.70s -> 7070.56s]  Red clothing that matches the holiday.
[7070.56s -> 7071.64s]  This dude is stoned.
[7071.64s -> 7073.84s]  I am not stoned right now.
[7073.84s -> 7076.89s]  I am fucking fine.
[7076.89s -> 7079.61s]  Oh, fucking, I'm gonna, no more swearing.
[7079.61s -> 7087.80s]  Check this out.
[7087.80s -> 7090.12s]  Oh, there's this popsicle.
[7090.12s -> 7109.08s]  Oh, that's gross.
[7109.08s -> 7110.43s]  Medium.
[7110.43s -> 7112.88s]  Wait, are we wearing the right clothes?
[7112.88s -> 7118.42s]  Can we change?
[7118.42s -> 7128.93s]  I can't change.
[7128.93s -> 7135.65s]  And then go like this.
[7135.65s -> 7143.13s]  There, I just want a smoothie now.
[7143.13s -> 7152.96s]  Yeah, me too.
[7152.96s -> 7158.18s]  This game just makes me want to go to Sonic.
[7158.18s -> 7178.51s]  I feel like that's where you get stuff like this nowadays.
[7179.27s -> 7180.11s]  All right, this one's almost there,
[7180.11s -> 7184.00s]  but I can take one order.
[7184.00s -> 7184.84s]  Come on.
[7184.84s -> 7191.04s]  Second order is wrong.
[7191.04s -> 7191.88s]  What?
[7191.88s -> 7200.84s]  What's wrong with it?
[7200.84s -> 7210.17s]  How did I do that?
[7210.17s -> 7211.01s]  This thing is huge.
[7211.01s -> 7216.46s]  S'mores, strawberry.
[7216.46s -> 7218.44s]  This person's gonna shit their pants.
[7218.44s -> 7220.20s]  I'm not supposed to be swearing.
[7221.60s -> 7222.44s]  Who cares?
[7222.44s -> 7230.54s]  What am I talking about?
[7230.54s -> 7234.05s]  All right, let me get back to this.
[7234.05s -> 7236.53s]  This one is this one.
[7236.53s -> 7239.33s]  This one is, no, this one's this one.
[7239.33s -> 7242.13s]  This one, this one, this one.
[7242.13s -> 7244.84s]  This has to speed up before I put anything else on.
[7244.84s -> 7260.12s]  Ow.
[7260.12s -> 7262.90s]  Okay.
[7262.90s -> 7268.75s]  Blueberry.
[7268.75s -> 7270.82s]  Cookie.
[7270.82s -> 7279.95s]  Ooh.
[7279.95s -> 7280.79s]  Do a poll.
[7280.79s -> 7284.08s]  We should bet to see if you won't square for 30 minutes.
[7284.08s -> 7285.28s]  Um, you can bet if you want.
[7285.28s -> 7286.12s]  I'll try.
[7286.12s -> 7296.10s]  I actually will try.
[7296.10s -> 7297.62s]  All right, should I make sure to tell this guy
[7297.62s -> 7299.28s]  that there's no returns?
[7299.28s -> 7300.64s]  You know what I mean?
[7300.64s -> 7301.72s]  Okay, I want you to want to understand
[7301.72s -> 7302.56s]  you know what you're ordering.
[7302.56s -> 7304.52s]  There are no returns or anything, right, dude?
[7304.52s -> 7317.60s]  Like, just make sure this person's well aware of this.
[7317.60s -> 7319.48s]  Look, this guy doesn't walk back in here in five minutes
[7319.48s -> 7323.31s]  and go, hey, this thing was gross.
[7323.31s -> 7325.86s]  Yeah, I know.
[7331.00s -> 7337.59s]  This person's been waiting.
[7337.59s -> 7341.37s]  Just try to get the worst score ever.
[7341.37s -> 7342.21s]  Hold on.
[7342.21s -> 7349.62s]  I gotta unlock stuff first before I do anything stupid.
[7349.62s -> 7352.78s]  This one is large.
[7352.78s -> 7356.31s]  Oh, throw it away.
[7356.31s -> 7358.54s]  Throw it away.
[7358.54s -> 7373.80s]  Wasting time here.
[7373.80s -> 7375.52s]  Oh, we got a Charborg raid.
[7375.52s -> 7377.44s]  Charborg, thanks for the raid.
[7377.44s -> 7379.83s]  Welcome, everybody.
[7379.83s -> 7383.25s]  Charborg raid.
[7383.25s -> 7384.69s]  Hold on.
[7384.69s -> 7386.45s]  Which one was this one?
[7386.45s -> 7387.37s]  I don't remember.
[7388.56s -> 7389.52s]  This is this one.
[7389.52s -> 7390.64s]  This is this one.
[7390.64s -> 7391.76s]  And then this, I haven't done this one yet.
[7391.76s -> 7399.99s]  All right, hold on, give me a second.
[7399.99s -> 7400.83s]  Hey, hey.
[7400.83s -> 7402.35s]  When Charborg plays this.
[7402.35s -> 7404.35s]  Hey, we'll check and see how they do.
[7404.35s -> 7405.90s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7405.90s -> 7409.15s]  Check and see how he does.
[7409.15s -> 7412.20s]  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
[7412.20s -> 7422.17s]  What is this one?
[7422.17s -> 7426.40s]  Okay, good.
[7426.40s -> 7427.48s]  I didn't swear.
[7427.48s -> 7429.45s]  No, I didn't.
[7429.45s -> 7430.29s]  What's happening?
[7430.29s -> 7431.11s]  Oh my God.
[7431.11s -> 7431.95s]  I thought that was the phone.
[7431.95s -> 7432.79s]  Oh shit.
[7432.79s -> 7436.81s]  All right, I have to pay attention right now.
[7436.81s -> 7439.67s]  I already did that.
[7439.67s -> 7455.20s]  What is it?
[7455.20s -> 7456.04s]  What?
[7456.04s -> 7457.76s]  What did I do?
[7457.76s -> 7459.32s]  Did I say something?
[7459.32s -> 7460.16s]  What?
[7460.16s -> 7463.27s]  What did I say?
[7463.27s -> 7467.09s]  Did I say something?
[7467.09s -> 7468.53s]  What did I say?
[7468.53s -> 7472.10s]  I don't even remember.
[7472.10s -> 7473.50s]  Oops.
[7473.50s -> 7482.44s]  Why would you ever trust me?
[7482.44s -> 7489.05s]  All right, you can trust me now.
[7489.05s -> 7490.50s]  You can trust me.
[7490.50s -> 7494.76s]  As of right now, for 30 minutes, I won't.
[7494.76s -> 7498.49s]  I don't even know what this person ordered.
[7498.49s -> 7509.11s]  How is that not perfect?
[7509.11s -> 7525.57s]  I am hand cranky.
[7525.57s -> 7528.59s]  Oh hey, I'm gonna get the stuffed animal squirrel.
[7528.59s -> 7538.20s]  I might need it in a second.
[7538.20s -> 7552.65s]  Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave.
[7552.65s -> 7554.73s]  I just found that so, all right.
[7554.73s -> 7564.92s]  Wait, wrong.
[7564.92s -> 7567.23s]  Not a bad day.
[7567.23s -> 7571.15s]  All right, timer starts now.
[7571.15s -> 7571.99s]  30 minutes from now.
[7571.99s -> 7574.40s]  I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[7574.40s -> 7577.96s]  There's not very many people that believe in me,
[7577.96s -> 7581.89s]  but we'll just prove them all wrong right now.
[7581.89s -> 7583.93s]  I know that those of you that lost everything
[7583.93s -> 7586.99s]  on shrine bets in Breath of the Wild,
[7586.99s -> 7590.03s]  now is the time for you to make it all back.
[7590.03s -> 7591.87s]  I would have gone all in on yes,
[7591.87s -> 7594.55s]  that I can not swear for 30 minutes.
[7594.55s -> 7597.48s]  I would have gone all in.
[7597.48s -> 7598.72s]  Believe in me this time.
[7605.88s -> 7608.24s]  I have a question with the committee here
[7608.24s -> 7610.76s]  that's gonna be judging this.
[7610.76s -> 7618.36s]  If it's allowed on regular TV, is that allowed?
[7625.55s -> 7626.39s]  No.
[7628.83s -> 7631.67s]  So, okay, where's the line then?
[7631.67s -> 7635.78s]  Where's the line?
[7635.78s -> 7640.32s]  If I were to say, oh, like a children's birthday party?
[7640.32s -> 7641.24s]  Okay.
[7641.24s -> 7642.08s]  So, what?
[7642.08s -> 7643.88s]  Oh, what the heck?
[7643.88s -> 7645.48s]  Oh, dang it.
[7645.48s -> 7651.84s]  That's okay, right?
[7651.84s -> 7654.54s]  Those are okay.
[7654.54s -> 7656.62s]  Okay, so just pretend that I'm at
[7656.62s -> 7658.26s]  a children's birthday party.
[7658.26s -> 7668.37s]  Okay.
[7668.37s -> 7670.29s]  It's almost similar right there.
[7670.73s -> 7683.12s]  Why did you get to be in the front?
[7683.12s -> 7691.21s]  It's dangerous too.
[7691.21s -> 7693.40s]  You have one dollar?
[7693.40s -> 7704.19s]  All right, I'm being it now.
[7704.19s -> 7713.29s]  We all can't collect the same coin.
[7713.29s -> 7714.13s]  Yeah, there it is.
[7714.13s -> 7720.76s]  All right, we're good.
[7720.76s -> 7724.99s]  Finally.
[7724.99s -> 7732.88s]  Ooh, what was that?
[7732.88s -> 7733.72s]  Oh, cool.
[7733.72s -> 7738.75s]  All right, keep that.
[7738.75s -> 7743.13s]  Oh, don't I have to dress up as,
[7743.13s -> 7745.41s]  we have to dress it in a certain outfit, don't we?
[7745.41s -> 7762.09s]  Does that matter?
[7762.09s -> 7767.12s]  I don't think that matters.
[7767.12s -> 7768.12s]  Is this a Facebook game?
[7768.12s -> 7772.54s]  This is a game on Steam.
[7772.58s -> 7774.18s]  You need to be the family-friendly version
[7774.18s -> 7775.98s]  of Die Hard that airs on ABC.
[7778.16s -> 7784.24s]  Okay, I can handle that.
[7784.24s -> 7785.48s]  I mean, we've already talked about it,
[7785.48s -> 7792.37s]  but when they did that joke in Mr. Show,
[7792.37s -> 7793.69s]  Bob Odenkirk and,
[7796.74s -> 7799.52s]  why can I not think of his name?
[7799.52s -> 7801.36s]  They were a comedy duo.
[7801.36s -> 7804.29s]  David Cross, yeah, there it is.
[7804.29s -> 7805.93s]  I'm gonna pause this because it's important.
[7805.93s -> 7808.49s]  They did that bit where it was kind of like
[7808.49s -> 7812.17s]  a Sopranos-like that was airing on regular,
[7812.21s -> 7814.52s]  kind of just cable television.
[7814.52s -> 7817.08s]  And it was, oh, whatever, the Sopranos parody,
[7817.08s -> 7820.32s]  whatever it is, brought to you with lots of,
[7820.32s -> 7827.36s]  what, it's not paused?
[7827.36s -> 7828.36s]  They need to do a bunch of edits,
[7828.36s -> 7830.64s]  so it was edited for television.
[7830.64s -> 7832.69s]  And it's just so funny.
[7832.69s -> 7834.33s]  There's only like two minutes of footage
[7834.33s -> 7837.13s]  in like a 30-minute episode.
[7837.13s -> 7839.09s]  Was it Mr. Show or Mad TV?
[7839.09s -> 7840.17s]  That was Mad TV.
[7840.17s -> 7841.75s]  That was Mr. Show?
[7841.75s -> 7845.56s]  That was Mr. Show as well.
[7845.56s -> 7846.60s]  Mad, it was Mr. Show.
[7846.60s -> 7848.80s]  It was on Mr. Show first.
[7848.80s -> 7854.61s]  Just wanna make sure you understand that.
[7854.61s -> 7856.13s]  Just in case, we just make sure this is really clear.
[7856.13s -> 7857.93s]  It was on Mr. Show first.
[7857.93s -> 7861.12s]  Let's clear the air here.
[7864.08s -> 7866.51s]  Oops.
[7866.51s -> 7867.39s]  They are waiting.
[7867.39s -> 7868.23s]  Cool, dude.
[7868.23s -> 7870.70s]  Whatever, cool story.
[7870.70s -> 7873.02s]  You're trying to get me to say a bad word
[7873.02s -> 7890.64s]  and it's not gonna happen.
[7890.64s -> 7891.80s]  These are both mediums, right?
[7891.80s -> 7899.84s]  This is the large, did I get this right?
[7899.84s -> 7901.80s]  Okay, this is the large.
[7901.80s -> 7905.46s]  We've got two mediums.
[7905.46s -> 7916.93s]  This one is Oreo and strawberry.
[7916.93s -> 7922.08s]  Same as well.
[7922.08s -> 7927.78s]  Holy smokes.
[7927.78s -> 7928.62s]  You're not winning.
[7928.62s -> 7930.06s]  I just wanna make sure you're aware of that.
[7930.06s -> 7937.30s]  You're not going to win.
[7937.30s -> 7938.14s]  I'm gonna make you,
[7938.14s -> 7939.46s]  I'm gonna put you on the edge of your seat
[7939.46s -> 7945.56s]  the whole entire 30 minutes.
[7945.56s -> 7953.06s]  Strawberry, plum, pomegranate, whatever.
[7953.06s -> 7954.22s]  I almost just got angry.
[7954.22s -> 7956.14s]  I just have to not be mad at random stuff
[7956.14s -> 7967.15s]  and I'll be fine.
[7967.15s -> 7969.41s]  Somebody at the counter.
[7969.41s -> 7984.19s]  I got it.
[7984.19s -> 7985.88s]  Do I even have that?
[7985.88s -> 7993.45s]  There's rocket whipped cream now?
[7993.45s -> 7995.85s]  There's rocket whipped cream?
[7995.85s -> 8014.96s]  What does this taste like?
[8014.96s -> 8019.26s]  You got that wrong?
[8019.26s -> 8022.46s]  You put so much stuff in there,
[8022.46s -> 8025.57s]  how would you even tell the difference?
[8025.73s -> 8029.34s]  I would like a tropical treat, please.
[8029.34s -> 8032.50s]  All right, this is medium, medium, medium.
[8032.50s -> 8037.26s]  The three mediums immediately.
[8037.26s -> 8038.74s]  How long have you been listening to the same
[8038.74s -> 8043.50s]  Poppist Freezeria music?
[8043.50s -> 8044.34s]  I mean, what are you?
[8044.34s -> 8046.42s]  Are you telling me to turn this down
[8046.42s -> 8050.54s]  and put on the Twinsons Odyssey soundtrack?
[8050.54s -> 8051.38s]  Is that what you're asking?
[8051.38s -> 8062.64s]  Because that's what it sounds like.
[8062.64s -> 8064.16s]  And then this is strawberry.
[8071.76s -> 8072.92s]  Is that gross?
[8072.92s -> 8074.00s]  That's kind of gross, isn't it?
[8074.00s -> 8083.52s]  I don't care.
[8083.52s -> 8086.91s]  Dude, do you even GAF?
[8086.91s -> 8090.63s]  Do I give, do I give a,
[8090.63s -> 8094.04s]  is that what you're saying?
[8094.04s -> 8096.42s]  The medium.
[8096.42s -> 8097.66s]  And it is,
[8106.98s -> 8108.30s]  this one's not even on here yet.
[8108.30s -> 8109.54s]  I gotta speed this up.
[8109.54s -> 8111.46s]  We'll do this one.
[8111.46s -> 8113.22s]  And okay, this is medium.
[8113.22s -> 8115.22s]  What is in this stuff?
[8115.22s -> 8121.38s]  Oh, which one is this one?
[8121.38s -> 8123.74s]  I'm, I'm, I'm actually,
[8123.74s -> 8126.50s]  I'm actually really messed up right now.
[8126.50s -> 8127.46s]  I gotta slow down.
[8127.46s -> 8131.54s]  Just wait till these are put these in queue.
[8131.54s -> 8133.02s]  Do this one first.
[8133.02s -> 8134.66s]  That's not even right.
[8134.66s -> 8138.45s]  What's even in here?
[8138.45s -> 8139.29s]  Is this this one?
[8140.29s -> 8144.28s]  I don't know which one this is.
[8144.28s -> 8146.17s]  I think this is the right one.
[8146.17s -> 8147.01s]  No, what?
[8147.01s -> 8148.23s]  No, it's this one.
[8148.23s -> 8149.07s]  Whose is this?
[8149.07s -> 8149.91s]  This isn't, this isn't,
[8149.91s -> 8155.30s]  what is this?
[8155.30s -> 8162.55s]  I think it's this one.
[8162.55s -> 8171.80s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[8171.80s -> 8177.32s]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[8177.32s -> 8178.16s]  I just got, look,
[8178.16s -> 8186.04s]  I have to just pay way more attention than I am right now.
[8186.04s -> 8188.64s]  It's this one.
[8188.64s -> 8191.68s]  Somebody's been waiting for that tropical treat
[8191.68s -> 8192.64s]  for a whole day.
[8193.60s -> 8197.44s]  Okay, I got it.
[8198.28s -> 8199.80s]  It's a medium, right?
[8199.80s -> 8200.64s]  Medium.
[8200.64s -> 8213.29s]  I have to get this going.
[8213.29s -> 8218.25s]  Peanuts, chocolate chips.
[8218.25s -> 8220.37s]  There's so much stuff on here.
[8220.37s -> 8224.51s]  You're not even gonna taste half of this.
[8225.43s -> 8226.59s]  And you want a cookie,
[8226.59s -> 8227.71s]  and you want a cookie,
[8227.71s -> 8228.55s]  and you want to,
[8228.55s -> 8236.00s]  you want all cookies.
[8236.00s -> 8244.32s]  You want every cookie we have.
[8244.32s -> 8257.48s]  Strawberry, sprinkles,
[8257.48s -> 8258.32s]  and then,
[8264.76s -> 8271.93s]  all right, I think we're fine.
[8271.93s -> 8272.77s]  Zero tip.
[8272.77s -> 8282.25s]  All right, I apologize.
[8282.25s -> 8286.40s]  And then it's coconut, sprinkles.
[8286.40s -> 8289.53s]  This one looks kind of good.
[8295.77s -> 8298.74s]  It was going so well, too.
[8298.74s -> 8301.14s]  That really annoys me.
[8311.41s -> 8315.21s]  How is that wrong?
[8315.21s -> 8316.05s]  It was wrong?
[8330.32s -> 8337.40s]  Okay, give me a sec.
[8337.40s -> 8343.12s]  Making a quick change here on the soundtrack.
[8343.12s -> 8344.56s]  Get that Twinsons Odyssey up there.
[8344.56s -> 8346.08s]  Why not?
[8346.08s -> 8347.20s]  Let's live a little.
[8355.76s -> 8362.50s]  42.
[8362.50s -> 8363.74s]  What about Doom OST?
[8365.60s -> 8367.52s]  You're gonna have to wait.
[8367.52s -> 8382.27s]  Let me get through this first.
[8382.27s -> 8387.03s]  Fingerless gloves?
[8387.03s -> 8388.79s]  That feels, I don't know,
[8388.79s -> 8393.07s]  fingerless gloves at a restaurant,
[8393.07s -> 8395.46s]  to me would almost be,
[8395.46s -> 8396.30s]  I don't know,
[8396.30s -> 8397.70s]  I saw someone with fingerless gloves.
[8397.70s -> 8398.54s]  They'd be like,
[8398.54s -> 8401.11s]  why are you wearing gloves in the first place?
[8401.11s -> 8406.10s]  Just don't even wear them.
[8406.10s -> 8406.94s]  Right?
[8406.94s -> 8424.03s]  I mean, the lore?
[8424.03s -> 8431.16s]  It's about the look.
[8431.16s -> 8432.32s]  What does this mean?
[8432.32s -> 8436.74s]  You're built like the bottom of a table in Chili's.
[8436.74s -> 8437.78s]  I don't know what that means,
[8437.78s -> 8440.14s]  but I don't know if that was like an insult or,
[8440.14s -> 8441.35s]  could have been.
[8441.35s -> 8447.81s]  But what does that mean?
[8447.81s -> 8449.05s]  Oh my God, he is.
[8449.45s -> 8454.82s]  I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[8454.82s -> 8461.12s]  Oh right, I was gonna do this.
[8461.12s -> 8462.52s]  Get our own music in here.
[8462.52s -> 8468.44s]  Not that the pop is music is bad or anything.
[8468.44s -> 8469.28s]  Let's go.
[8474.12s -> 8482.91s]  Let's go.
[8482.91s -> 8487.71s]  Should I buy something?
[8487.71s -> 8489.11s]  Pizza tower OST?
[8489.11s -> 8489.95s]  We'll do that next.
[8489.95s -> 8496.56s]  That sounds good to me.
[8496.56s -> 8502.32s]  Booster two?
[8502.32s -> 8503.96s]  This is pretty good anti-swear music.
[8503.96s -> 8509.70s]  Yes, it is.
[8509.70s -> 8531.52s]  Why would I swear to this?
[8531.52s -> 8537.72s]  Medium.
[8537.72s -> 8538.96s]  Hey, it's my birthday in a few months.
[8538.96s -> 8541.80s]  Can you swear right now for it?
[8541.80s -> 8546.30s]  You don't ask for a birthday present that far out.
[8546.30s -> 8555.09s]  That's a little too far out, I think.
[8555.09s -> 8578.25s]  I think within 30 days is reasonable though.
[8578.25s -> 8579.09s]  All right.
[8579.09s -> 8580.85s]  No more birthday stuff.
[8580.85s -> 8583.29s]  How much time do I have before I can speak?
[8583.29s -> 8584.13s]  14 minutes?
[8584.13s -> 8587.84s]  Okay.
[8587.84s -> 8588.66s]  I'm running right now.
[8588.66s -> 8589.50s]  All right.
[8589.50s -> 8591.63s]  Let me get this out pretty quickly.
[8591.63s -> 8592.67s]  This is this one.
[8596.95s -> 8614.48s]  Medium fudge brownie moon.
[8614.48s -> 8641.64s]  Ooh, this looks good.
[8641.64s -> 8642.48s]  All right.
[8642.48s -> 8645.61s]  Where's this ice cream that's gone?
[8645.61s -> 8649.03s]  Where's this ice cream?
[8649.03s -> 8650.71s]  What happened to the ice cream?
[8650.71s -> 8659.87s]  Oh, thank you.
[8660.79s -> 8684.59s]  Goodness, it's easy.
[8684.59s -> 8688.04s]  This one's pretty easy.
[8688.04s -> 8689.56s]  Ah, now we slow it down a little bit.
[8689.56s -> 8698.54s]  I like this part.
[8698.54s -> 8702.08s]  You play with such a little urgency, it infuriates me.
[8702.08s -> 8716.30s]  Um, how is this not urgency?
[8716.30s -> 8717.30s]  I'm being very urgent.
[8717.30s -> 8733.33s]  I'm just not effective.
[8733.33s -> 8736.01s]  Calypso Island coconuts.
[8736.01s -> 8746.76s]  What was that?
[8746.76s -> 8751.47s]  That's a medium.
[8751.47s -> 8752.29s]  That's a volume.
[8752.29s -> 8754.20s]  Volume good?
[8754.20s -> 8756.38s]  See if I can do this one by just memory.
[8756.38s -> 8757.22s]  I believe it is.
[8757.22s -> 8758.04s]  I don't know.
[8758.04s -> 8773.84s]  I can't do it.
[8773.84s -> 8774.68s]  Okay.
[8774.68s -> 8781.30s]  Lots of mediums.
[8781.30s -> 8782.12s]  Okay.
[8782.12s -> 8783.20s]  Let's go.
[8783.20s -> 8784.02s]  Medium.
[8784.02s -> 8790.16s]  This is Oreo chocolate.
[8791.00s -> 8792.06s]  Good.
[8792.06s -> 8792.90s]  Get it up there.
[8792.90s -> 8800.70s]  Alarm.
[8800.70s -> 8801.52s]  Good.
[8801.52s -> 8802.36s]  Avoiding speaking is cheating.
[8802.36s -> 8807.36s]  I've been talking this whole time.
[8807.36s -> 8808.20s]  Okay.
[8808.20s -> 8809.56s]  I need that.
[8809.56s -> 8810.40s]  What?
[8810.40s -> 8819.09s]  What's going on?
[8819.09s -> 8827.19s]  Coconut syrup.
[8827.19s -> 8834.10s]  How much time do I have?
[8834.10s -> 8843.74s]  Music is ominous.
[8843.74s -> 8852.18s]  Sorry.
[8852.18s -> 8875.71s]  Uh, um, okay.
[8875.71s -> 8878.68s]  Ooh.
[8878.68s -> 8894.83s]  This one is white chocolate syrup and peanuts and cherry.
[8896.99s -> 8904.32s]  And then get the heck out of here.
[8904.32s -> 8906.32s]  The music is too loud.
[8915.96s -> 8921.11s]  Peanuts.
[8921.11s -> 8921.95s]  I can see this one.
[8921.95s -> 8934.12s]  This one looks pretty good.
[8934.12s -> 8936.51s]  You should play Peglin.
[8936.51s -> 8942.31s]  That's actually been on the list for a long time.
[8942.31s -> 8943.93s]  Peglin's been on the list.
[8943.93s -> 8955.92s]  Just haven't played it.
[8955.92s -> 8956.76s]  Blender ball.
[8956.76s -> 8957.58s]  All right.
[8957.58s -> 8963.14s]  Let me get this one right.
[8963.14s -> 8965.12s]  Is that not high enough?
[8965.12s -> 8967.72s]  No, I got it.
[8967.72s -> 8979.97s]  The shoes.
[8979.97s -> 8980.81s]  Ooh.
[8980.81s -> 8981.63s]  Gold tile.
[8981.63s -> 8989.30s]  Let's check it out.
[8989.30s -> 9000.89s]  I almost just said a bad word.
[9000.89s -> 9007.22s]  Cool.
[9007.22s -> 9011.18s]  I like that.
[9011.18s -> 9017.28s]  Everything's a little too ugly at the moment.
[9017.28s -> 9021.92s]  That looks a lot better.
[9021.92s -> 9027.24s]  Buying some money with replay.
[9027.24s -> 9029.95s]  Oh, let me change this.
[9030.79s -> 9034.56s]  Let me change the special.
[9034.56s -> 9035.40s]  Pink pomegranate.
[9035.40s -> 9038.19s]  Let's try that.
[9038.19s -> 9039.03s]  Oh, what about this one?
[9039.03s -> 9046.89s]  This one's much less complicated.
[9046.89s -> 9054.44s]  Time, six minutes left.
[9054.44s -> 9055.68s]  Star sprinkles.
[9061.57s -> 9063.25s]  What's the next infomercial stream?
[9063.25s -> 9065.25s]  Well, tomorrow we are watching 90s ads.
[9065.25s -> 9075.80s]  So I think that's part of, kind of fills that, doesn't it?
[9075.80s -> 9076.92s]  Large, let's go.
[9079.87s -> 9089.50s]  Strawberry chocolate.
[9089.50s -> 9096.18s]  And then this is whipped cream plum star sprinkles.
[9096.18s -> 9098.08s]  And the auto carrot is well tomorrow.
[9098.12s -> 9106.98s]  That's right.
[9106.98s -> 9109.66s]  It's more strawberry.
[9109.66s -> 9119.16s]  Large.
[9119.16s -> 9121.85s]  No, it's more first, right?
[9121.85s -> 9123.66s]  Doesn't matter.
[9123.66s -> 9135.50s]  It does.
[9135.50s -> 9136.32s]  This is the right one, right?
[9136.32s -> 9146.04s]  Yeah.
[9146.04s -> 9154.72s]  Those are cool.
[9154.72s -> 9155.56s]  Okay.
[9155.56s -> 9156.38s]  How are we doing?
[9156.38s -> 9167.86s]  Did you swear or no, I didn't?
[9167.86s -> 9172.02s]  When?
[9172.02s -> 9176.20s]  You're full of baloney.
[9176.20s -> 9177.76s]  This one goes hard, by the way.
[9177.76s -> 9197.02s]  I didn't say anything bad.
[9197.02s -> 9197.86s]  What?
[9200.22s -> 9209.02s]  When did I say this word?
[9209.02s -> 9215.97s]  You, I said, what?
[9215.97s -> 9216.81s]  We need a clip.
[9216.81s -> 9217.63s]  We need a clip.
[9217.63s -> 9222.52s]  I need a clip.
[9222.52s -> 9224.80s]  You're trying to get me to say that in chat.
[9224.80s -> 9226.84s]  Cause you're trying to make me believe I already said it
[9226.84s -> 9231.77s]  and I already lost.
[9231.81s -> 9233.21s]  Wait, you're confusing me.
[9233.21s -> 9234.37s]  Hold on.
[9234.37s -> 9236.92s]  Maybe two mediums.
[9236.92s -> 9253.06s]  That's large.
[9253.06s -> 9265.47s]  Cake and moon.
[9265.47s -> 9266.29s]  All right.
[9266.29s -> 9271.17s]  So what's happening here?
[9271.17s -> 9272.19s]  90 seconds left.
[9272.19s -> 9273.03s]  Yeah.
[9273.03s -> 9273.93s]  You, you made it up.
[9273.93s -> 9277.44s]  I don't say, hey, I don't see a single clip.
[9277.44s -> 9278.52s]  I have not received the clip.
[9278.52s -> 9281.04s]  I have not received a single confirmation of this.
[9293.30s -> 9294.14s]  Oops.
[9307.19s -> 9308.79s]  Don't replace what I was doing.
[9318.66s -> 9322.34s]  Somebody said, someone do something.
[9322.34s -> 9326.92s]  I told you to believe you didn't want to.
[9326.92s -> 9342.96s]  Someone do something.
[9342.96s -> 9343.80s]  Okay.
[9343.80s -> 9347.00s]  Now where's this clip of me magically saying a bad word?
[9347.00s -> 9349.55s]  Let me see it.
[9349.55s -> 9353.31s]  You got two waters left, huh?
[9353.31s -> 9354.15s]  10 seconds.
[9359.19s -> 9362.47s]  How do I make this?
[9362.47s -> 9363.79s]  This is, is it a medium?
[9363.79s -> 9373.98s]  This is a medium, strawberry and two mediums anyways.
[9373.98s -> 9376.02s]  Well, I, I don't want to, I don't want to lose.
[9376.02s -> 9389.58s]  I can't pause the game.
[9389.58s -> 9390.86s]  Cake and chocolate.
[9390.86s -> 9392.93s]  Let's go.
[9392.93s -> 9393.77s]  All right.
[9393.77s -> 9394.59s]  So what, what is this?
[9394.59s -> 9395.53s]  This is the clip they keep linking,
[9395.53s -> 9396.73s]  but I don't hear anything.
[9396.73s -> 9407.23s]  You only say baloney.
[9407.23s -> 9411.70s]  You're full of baloney.
[9411.70s -> 9414.20s]  This one goes hard by the way.
[9414.20s -> 9416.60s]  I didn't say anything.
[9416.60s -> 9419.14s]  I think you guys are, I think you just a little salty
[9419.14s -> 9424.57s]  that you actually lost.
[9424.57s -> 9425.57s]  Believers win.
[9425.57s -> 9432.98s]  I think there's no hard evidence here.
[9432.98s -> 9433.82s]  Jermis's bad word.
[9433.82s -> 9441.66s]  Jermis's bad word.
[9441.66s -> 9444.62s]  No, there's no spurs.
[9444.62s -> 9449.16s]  We're good.
[9449.16s -> 9451.86s]  Wait, you're doing it again?
[9452.70s -> 9457.82s]  Double or nothing?
[9457.82s -> 9458.78s]  No, I don't want to just,
[9458.78s -> 9466.80s]  I don't want to not be able to say a swear for an hour.
[9466.80s -> 9475.42s]  That's actually annoying.
[9475.42s -> 9480.29s]  And then it's pomegranate.
[9480.29s -> 9483.25s]  This one looks kind of tasty.
[9483.25s -> 9497.10s]  And then it's wafer cherry wafer.
[9497.10s -> 9501.90s]  Cool.
[9501.90s -> 9506.48s]  Right away.
[9506.48s -> 9523.31s]  How come there's no alarm on that one?
[9523.31s -> 9524.75s]  How come you can't swear for an hour?
[9524.75s -> 9528.87s]  Are you five?
[9528.87s -> 9550.74s]  It was just a fucking experiment.
[9550.74s -> 9551.58s]  I was reading chat.
[9551.58s -> 9555.34s]  How did I, whatever.
[9555.34s -> 9560.42s]  You're a paraffin charlatan.
[9560.42s -> 9561.26s]  Delete your Twitch.
[9561.26s -> 9580.17s]  What?
[9580.17s -> 9582.60s]  Here you go.
[9582.60s -> 9592.84s]  What's coming up next on the Twinsons Odyssey soundtrack?
[9592.84s -> 9616.63s]  Oh, good one.
[9616.63s -> 9623.08s]  Almost level nine?
[9623.08s -> 9650.91s]  Oh, yeah.
[9650.91s -> 9652.79s]  No, no, you're supposed to be bad at these.
[9652.79s -> 9680.97s]  You're supposed to be bad at these.
[9680.97s -> 9718.94s]  No, you're supposed to be bad at these.
[9718.94s -> 9745.66s]  Just wear the same outfit.
[9745.66s -> 9746.50s]  What's the music?
[9746.50s -> 9748.10s]  It's Twinsons Odyssey.
[9748.10s -> 9755.45s]  Little Big Adventure 2.
[9755.45s -> 9761.04s]  This is the longest I've ever played a Poppa's game for.
[9761.04s -> 9771.07s]  Without a doubt.
[9771.07s -> 9772.64s]  That looks pretty good.
[9772.64s -> 9793.56s]  Get rid of the toppings and you got a believer out of me.
[9793.56s -> 9800.34s]  Can you play Ghostbusters, like the Ghostbusters music?
[9800.34s -> 9802.82s]  You know what I used to do all the time?
[9802.82s -> 9806.90s]  I used to listen to Ghostbusters theme song remixes.
[9806.90s -> 9807.94s]  It was like one of my favorite things.
[9807.94s -> 9810.93s]  I would just listen to them.
[9810.93s -> 9812.74s]  If there's one thing,
[9812.74s -> 9816.18s]  the Ghostbusters theme song has like thousands
[9816.18s -> 9830.40s]  of unbelievable remixes.
[9830.40s -> 9833.11s]  Oh fuck.
[9833.11s -> 9835.95s]  Good thing nobody cares that I just said that.
[9846.66s -> 9866.50s]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[9866.50s -> 9867.34s]  What did I just do?
[9867.34s -> 9868.61s]  All right, we're fine.
[9868.61s -> 9869.75s]  Oh, should I put one on?
[9869.75s -> 9874.38s]  I think I'm gonna go find one.
[9874.38s -> 9883.87s]  How about Ghostbusters remix?
[9883.87s -> 9885.27s]  This one's probably good.
[9885.27s -> 9895.50s]  Find out.
[9895.50s -> 9903.37s]  Oh, whoa, let's go.
[9903.37s -> 9904.37s]  Did you fly us down?
[9904.37s -> 9919.96s]  What?
[9919.96s -> 9933.58s]  Whoa.
[9933.58s -> 9935.38s]  I'm saying, if there's a DJ doing this on stage,
[9935.38s -> 9937.30s]  I'm trying to take an order.
[9937.30s -> 9939.86s]  If a DJ was doing this on stage, I would be screaming.
[9939.86s -> 9942.94s]  I would be fucking screaming at this guy.
[9942.94s -> 9944.42s]  Like, yeah!
[9944.46s -> 9946.70s]  Yeah, you're the fucking man!
[9946.70s -> 9947.90s]  Yeah!
[9947.90s -> 9949.18s]  Yes!
[9949.18s -> 9950.02s]  Yes!
[9950.02s -> 9958.74s]  I would be so pumped up about this.
[9958.74s -> 9969.15s]  You'd be able to hear me over the entire club.
[9969.15s -> 9971.07s]  This is wrong.
[9971.07s -> 9976.10s]  Good thing you, I don't even care.
[9976.10s -> 9979.70s]  Wait, which one is this?
[9979.70s -> 9993.06s]  Shit, sorry.
[9993.06s -> 9995.38s]  Dude, I'm gonna be dancing.
[9995.38s -> 10007.85s]  This is so bad.
[10007.85s -> 10008.85s]  All right, that was pretty sick.
[10008.85s -> 10010.64s]  All right, so what else we got?
[10010.64s -> 10015.56s]  There's a ton of these.
[10015.56s -> 10020.60s]  What is this one?
[10020.60s -> 10030.46s]  Ooh, sorry, I'm busy.
[10030.46s -> 10037.30s]  You guys need something?
[10037.34s -> 10078.63s]  Maybe don't even go faster.
[10078.63s -> 10079.47s]  Oh, that was cool.
[10079.47s -> 10081.32s]  What about another one?
[10081.32s -> 10082.40s]  Wait, let me finish this.
[10088.54s -> 10089.90s]  This and then that.
[10089.90s -> 10093.06s]  Okay, the medium.
[10093.06s -> 10112.44s]  And pink pomegranate is strawberry and this sauce.
[10112.44s -> 10125.15s]  Shoot, hold on, hold on.
[10125.15s -> 10126.51s]  People are begging for this.
[10126.51s -> 10127.95s]  Please, please, please.
[10127.95s -> 10129.23s]  We're begging, we're begging, we're begging,
[10129.23s -> 10132.54s]  we're begging, we're begging.
[10132.54s -> 10133.46s]  Well, you're gonna have to wait a second
[10133.46s -> 10141.86s]  because we're way overdue on this.
[10141.86s -> 10145.27s]  I'll play it, just wait.
[10145.27s -> 10146.75s]  I can't pause the workday.
[10151.14s -> 10154.56s]  Okay, this one is pink pomegranate.
[10154.56s -> 10156.96s]  This one, wait, what's going on?
[10156.96s -> 10158.28s]  Oh, it's this one.
[10158.28s -> 10164.43s]  Okay, I just wanna smell this stuff.
[10164.43s -> 10175.84s]  I don't even wanna eat it.
[10175.84s -> 10177.48s]  God damn it.
[10177.48s -> 10195.29s]  Okay, okay.
[10195.29s -> 10198.74s]  I'm gonna play this for like a minute.
[10198.74s -> 10210.50s]  This whole stream's gonna get copyright claimed.
[10210.50s -> 10227.32s]  Okay, this is classic.
[10243.51s -> 10249.88s]  Can you please draw a butt with the sauce?
[10249.88s -> 10251.32s]  Oh, you're in a sea of people
[10252.12s -> 10253.12s]  who are, you know what?
[10253.12s -> 10268.52s]  I'm gonna listen to that request.
[10268.52s -> 10312.05s]  This is the last one of the day, right?
[10312.05s -> 10323.04s]  Damn it.
[10323.04s -> 10329.55s]  Oh, there's another layer?
[10329.55s -> 10330.75s]  Oh, I didn't draw a butt.
[10334.86s -> 10338.16s]  How do I do this?
[10338.16s -> 10339.16s]  I can't draw.
[10342.56s -> 10343.96s]  Whatever, they got extra sauce.
[10343.96s -> 10346.04s]  I can't even, you can't draw a butt, guys.
[10352.05s -> 10368.66s]  I can't, let's, all right, let's go.
[10368.66s -> 10374.58s]  How about, oh, how about Just Dance 2014?
[10374.62s -> 10377.14s]  Ghostbusters.
[10377.98s -> 10386.98s]  There's so many versions of this song.
[10386.98s -> 10396.46s]  This isn't Just Dance.
[10396.46s -> 10406.66s]  I think this is, oh, this is just a regular one.
[10406.66s -> 10410.88s]  Here's a dubstep remix.
[10410.88s -> 10423.92s]  This one could be really good.
[10423.92s -> 10437.56s]  I don't remember.
[10437.56s -> 10456.66s]  I think it's this, oops.
[10456.66s -> 10482.16s]  Oh, oh, hell yeah.
[10482.16s -> 10500.52s]  What is he like?
[10500.52s -> 10503.90s]  Awesome.
[10503.90s -> 10510.29s]  How about the epic version?
[10510.29s -> 10514.42s]  Ooh, epic version, like Joel's?
[10514.42s -> 10533.68s]  Okay, after the epic version.
[10533.68s -> 10549.06s]  Dude, these are, they're all so different.
[10549.06s -> 10564.79s]  Here's another one.
[10564.79s -> 10572.00s]  The ghost, I ain't afraid of no ghost.
[10572.00s -> 10582.89s]  He no afraid, I ain't afraid of the ghost.
[10582.89s -> 10590.64s]  There's more?
[10590.64s -> 10593.56s]  This one is pretty, this one fucking slaps.
[10593.56s -> 10606.54s]  There is no main fridge.
[10606.54s -> 10607.90s]  Yeah, that was Joel.
[10607.90s -> 10610.04s]  That was Joel's version.
[10610.04s -> 10614.24s]  There's no milk in my fridge, so I get pissed?
[10614.24s -> 10618.38s]  Ghostbusters.
[10618.38s -> 10633.26s]  What was this one?
[10633.26s -> 10636.01s]  The game's frozen, right?
[10636.01s -> 10637.86s]  That was fucking awesome.
[10637.86s -> 10645.10s]  How about one more Ghostbusters theme remix,
[10645.10s -> 10647.04s]  and I swear, have we done?
[10647.04s -> 10650.47s]  I thought this video had over a billion views.
[10650.47s -> 10653.23s]  I was like, holy shit, I told you this was popular.
[10653.23s -> 10655.91s]  I thought this is over one billion views.
[10655.91s -> 10662.05s]  I was gonna say, some of those are me.
[10662.05s -> 10666.76s]  A billion.
[10666.76s -> 10671.42s]  Luigi's Mansion theme remix?
[10671.42s -> 10695.63s]  Woo, hold on.
[10695.63s -> 10703.39s]  Nice.
[10703.39s -> 10706.09s]  Ooh, new toppings.
[10706.09s -> 10710.10s]  Cupcake, is that like red velvet?
[10710.10s -> 10729.87s]  Oh, you only want a little spin.
[10729.87s -> 10731.15s]  Imagine calling an order here,
[10731.15s -> 10735.24s]  and you're hearing that in the background.
[10735.24s -> 10736.52s]  All right, I need to focus.
[10759.54s -> 10766.38s]  Ghostbusters theme on eight floppy drives.
[10769.86s -> 10784.78s]  Are you kidding me?
[10784.78s -> 10800.76s]  This is actually impressive, this is really impressive.
[10800.76s -> 10802.32s]  Someone explain to me how this person's room
[10802.32s -> 10806.66s]  is not smoking right now.
[10806.66s -> 10808.10s]  This one's large.
[10808.10s -> 10810.78s]  Wait, can I still, I didn't even put this one to order.
[10810.82s -> 10813.70s]  This person's an order.
[10813.70s -> 10814.94s]  Whatever, let's do this.
[10821.18s -> 10822.62s]  You want it regular, okay.
[10822.62s -> 10833.51s]  And what do you want, regular?
[10833.51s -> 10838.11s]  Good, this is, they bolt this way, good, okay.
[10838.11s -> 10843.90s]  What do you want?
[10843.90s -> 10852.52s]  That's pretty cool.
[10852.52s -> 10857.06s]  Okay, I need to remember which one's which.
[10857.06s -> 10858.90s]  This one is this one, this one is that one,
[10858.90s -> 10861.27s]  and this one has not been done yet.
[10861.27s -> 10865.01s]  This one's a medium, let's go ahead and get that started.
[10865.01s -> 10870.41s]  Doesn't matter, it does matter, throw it away.
[10870.41s -> 10879.84s]  They have an envelope, and this one is medium as well.
[10879.84s -> 10886.42s]  All right, let's go.
[10887.26s -> 10890.52s]  Chocolate whipped cream, this game's fun.
[10890.52s -> 10892.44s]  I mean, it's the same kind of stuff over and over again,
[10892.44s -> 10904.86s]  but it's fun.
[10904.86s -> 10908.69s]  Be overblended, not by very much.
[10908.69s -> 10910.15s]  All right, I gotta hurry up.
[10910.15s -> 10912.37s]  This thing's gonna be overblended.
[10912.37s -> 10913.41s]  No, we're good.
[10913.41s -> 10915.81s]  Okay, this one is this one, let's go.
[10919.32s -> 10936.18s]  Good, good, hurry up, hurry up.
[10936.18s -> 10939.18s]  Stop putting this shit in front of my order.
[10939.18s -> 10942.70s]  You idiots, I'm the only person that works here.
[10942.74s -> 10965.84s]  Okay, this is a medium, and this looks good.
[10965.84s -> 10970.88s]  Some pomegranate on there, cool.
[10970.88s -> 10975.81s]  All right, it matters where you put the cookies
[10975.81s -> 10983.89s]  and the fruit, yeah, I know, but I've very, ooh.
[10985.80s -> 10987.59s]  Is that spinning?
[10987.59s -> 10999.43s]  Wait, this is a critic, this has to be good.
[10999.43s -> 11007.54s]  Let's get this one out first, that's right, right?
[11007.54s -> 11013.00s]  Yep, all right, it was a large, good.
[11013.00s -> 11014.44s]  Brownie, everything has to be perfect.
[11014.44s -> 11019.76s]  I'm gonna try as hard as I can on this one, good.
[11019.76s -> 11022.78s]  Throw it away, no, throw it away, it's not good enough.
[11022.82s -> 11024.54s]  Gordon Ramsay is here right now.
[11024.54s -> 11028.04s]  That wasn't perfect, throw it away.
[11028.04s -> 11039.21s]  Why is it not perfect?
[11039.21s -> 11046.49s]  Okay, you wanna blend it all the way?
[11046.49s -> 11057.34s]  Play two trucks, oh my God, hold on, hold on a second.
[11057.34s -> 11072.18s]  Is strawberry whipped cream, strawberry sauce, pomegranate.
[11072.18s -> 11093.22s]  Pomegranate, and then it's wafer, cherry wafer, yep.
[11093.22s -> 11096.54s]  That was a good one.
[11096.54s -> 11101.82s]  This one has to be perfect, remember?
[11101.82s -> 11116.02s]  All right, let's go, that's pretty close to being perfect.
[11116.02s -> 11141.11s]  Fuck, actually, that was really loud, I'm sorry.
[11141.11s -> 11147.25s]  That's good enough.
[11148.21s -> 11151.85s]  Oh yeah, pizza tower.
[11151.85s -> 11153.55s]  Yeah!
[11153.55s -> 11166.36s]  Pizza tower, OST.
[11166.36s -> 11169.64s]  Yeah!
[11169.64s -> 11176.99s]  Two trucks, two trucks, you're good.
[11176.99s -> 11180.61s]  I'll do it after this.
[11180.61s -> 11184.22s]  I've been playing this game for three hours, how?
[11184.22s -> 11217.06s]  I'm just gonna chill in this school, all right.
[11217.06s -> 11223.26s]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[11223.26s -> 11239.11s]  Ooh, lime.
[11239.11s -> 11243.90s]  Yeah!
[11243.90s -> 11260.94s]  Ooh, a cat, can I get them all?
[11260.94s -> 11271.35s]  Yes!
[11271.35s -> 11287.56s]  All right, this outfit's gotta go, okay.
[11287.56s -> 11299.37s]  Jacket or no jacket?
[11299.37s -> 11307.24s]  Gum balls, chocolate syrup balls?
[11307.28s -> 11311.29s]  This matches the holiday, double points, ooh.
[11311.29s -> 11318.77s]  Really?
[11318.77s -> 11320.53s]  You ever gonna P-rank any of these levels?
[11320.53s -> 11322.87s]  No, no way.
[11322.87s -> 11325.99s]  I can just enjoy the fact that I loved this game.
[11325.99s -> 11331.14s]  It was very good, and that's it.
[11331.14s -> 11333.98s]  All right, I get double points.
[11333.98s -> 11339.01s]  Do two trucks, all right, I will, what, two trucks.
[11339.01s -> 11354.50s]  I will play your song, Two Trucks.
[11354.50s -> 11360.15s]  Two Trucks is about two trucks having sex.
[11360.15s -> 11366.31s]  Oh, is it not?
[11366.31s -> 11368.39s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11368.39s -> 11370.15s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11370.15s -> 11370.99s]  It is.
[11370.99s -> 11374.71s]  My muscles, my muscles involuntarily flex.
[11374.71s -> 11376.79s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11376.79s -> 11378.87s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11378.87s -> 11383.11s]  My muscles, my muscles involuntarily flex.
[11383.11s -> 11389.42s]  Two bigger trucks making love.
[11389.42s -> 11404.25s]  I screwed this up, hold on.
[11404.25s -> 11411.14s]  Anybody else?
[11411.14s -> 11418.68s]  That's pretty fucking sick.
[11418.68s -> 11419.64s]  We're back on?
[11419.64s -> 11425.24s]  We're just jumping around, we're shuffling around.
[11425.96s -> 11426.80s]  Two huge trucks.
[11430.16s -> 11431.92s]  Finish that song now.
[11431.92s -> 11439.78s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11439.78s -> 11458.56s]  I'm wasting time, okay.
[11458.56s -> 11469.64s]  Nope, any more?
[11469.64s -> 11470.84s]  Nope, beat this one up.
[11484.06s -> 11499.54s]  This one's very easy, it's a pretty good drizzle.
[11499.54s -> 11508.50s]  Nice.
[11508.50s -> 11510.26s]  Welcome new viewers.
[11510.26s -> 11511.10s]  Yeah, hi.
[11512.86s -> 11513.98s]  Are there new viewers here?
[11513.98s -> 11516.94s]  Two trucks.
[11516.94s -> 11519.06s]  The weird thing is that I'm a new viewer too.
[11519.06s -> 11521.10s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11521.10s -> 11521.94s]  Whatever.
[11521.94s -> 11525.28s]  Two trucks having sex.
[11526.28s -> 11527.36s]  This is a large, right?
[11527.36s -> 11536.89s]  Yeah.
[11536.89s -> 11540.79s]  Peanuts.
[11540.79s -> 11548.32s]  Good drizzle, good drizzle.
[11548.32s -> 11553.53s]  Pretty damn good drizzle.
[11553.53s -> 11554.45s]  That's a perfect.
[11566.71s -> 11568.42s]  Sick, all right.
[11568.42s -> 11572.86s]  That's a funny song.
[11572.86s -> 11577.62s]  It's a classic.
[11577.62s -> 11581.45s]  I want the pizza tower time song.
[11581.45s -> 11593.02s]  Where is it?
[11593.02s -> 11597.43s]  What's it called?
[11597.43s -> 11607.98s]  This is it, right?
[11607.98s -> 11641.53s]  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[11641.53s -> 11645.83s]  This is one of the best soundtracks I think I've ever heard.
[11645.83s -> 11647.27s]  I think it just is.
[11647.27s -> 11648.99s]  I really think this is probably one of the best soundtracks
[11648.99s -> 11651.27s]  in any video game that's ever released.
[11651.27s -> 11652.11s]  That's true.
[11654.12s -> 11656.56s]  Every single song is fantastic.
[11656.56s -> 11663.77s]  I don't think this one's not good.
[11663.77s -> 11665.21s]  I got these flips by the way.
[11691.99s -> 11693.91s]  Is this, this is a different version though.
[11693.91s -> 11696.98s]  Where's the other version?
[11696.98s -> 11707.93s]  Where does it go into that version?
[11707.93s -> 11713.05s]  You got the other one in mod chat?
[11713.05s -> 11714.01s]  Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[11714.01s -> 11715.09s]  This is it, this is it, let's go.
[11715.09s -> 11727.23s]  This is the one.
[11727.23s -> 11737.08s]  All right, we're gonna do this one here.
[11737.08s -> 11740.78s]  Medium.
[11740.78s -> 11748.09s]  Go faster, I'm trying.
[11748.09s -> 11750.05s]  Is this making me need to poop?
[11750.05s -> 11752.96s]  Well, that's, is that a bad thing?
[11752.96s -> 11755.48s]  It might be, it's making you more regular?
[11755.48s -> 11756.32s]  I don't know.
[11756.32s -> 11792.45s]  It's a medium, right?
[11792.45s -> 11806.44s]  Both chunky.
[11806.44s -> 11809.67s]  Go.
[11809.67s -> 11816.42s]  That placement was awful.
[11816.42s -> 11819.66s]  Did I get the order wrong?
[11819.66s -> 11832.87s]  No, I didn't.
[11832.87s -> 11849.97s]  Shoot.
[11849.97s -> 11854.35s]  Uh-oh.
[11854.35s -> 11856.07s]  Go, go, go, hurry up.
[11856.07s -> 11860.60s]  What?
[11860.60s -> 11861.44s]  What is this?
[11861.44s -> 11865.96s]  This is the wrong, why is there another one?
[11865.96s -> 11867.28s]  Who is this?
[11867.28s -> 11880.64s]  I'm going too fast.
[11880.64s -> 11894.22s]  Hurry, hurry before he, I'm going, I'm going.
[11894.22s -> 11932.36s]  Ah!
[11932.36s -> 11951.58s]  Okay.
[11951.58s -> 11957.03s]  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.
[11957.03s -> 11958.62s]  Sorry.
[11960.62s -> 11975.46s]  I'm a fucking porky pig over here.
[11975.46s -> 11978.45s]  But you just don't have to use any of this shit.
[11978.45s -> 11980.91s]  No!
[11980.91s -> 11995.89s]  I don't like these, it's fine.
[11995.89s -> 11999.10s]  Is that gonna do it?
[11999.10s -> 12001.70s]  I had it and it was gone, it was there.
[12001.70s -> 12003.54s]  And I just, I, you know what?
[12003.54s -> 12021.55s]  Let's fucking get funky.
[12021.55s -> 12023.34s]  What's this one?
[12024.34s -> 12027.67s]  That's a good one too.
[12038.31s -> 12043.70s]  That's a good one.
[12043.70s -> 12046.29s]  All right, after this order, after this day,
[12046.29s -> 12049.74s]  I'm gonna take a quick VRB.
[12049.74s -> 12054.32s]  We'll come back and we'll decide what's gonna happen then.
[12054.32s -> 12057.66s]  I'm kind of just enjoying hanging out and playing this.
[12057.66s -> 12064.46s]  I got another game I could move to, but we'll see.
[12064.46s -> 12067.02s]  I will tell you the time tomorrow.
[12067.02s -> 12071.58s]  The 90s commercials stream is going to be tomorrow afternoon.
[12071.58s -> 12074.28s]  It's not gonna be six o'clock.
[12074.28s -> 12078.38s]  I'm gonna start a little bit earlier.
[12078.38s -> 12084.59s]  Cause I know that, okay.
[12084.59s -> 12086.87s]  So do you use a grand charm that adds 11 to defense?
[12086.87s -> 12088.11s]  Oh no, not throw that away.
[12088.11s -> 12090.10s]  Sell that immediately.
[12090.10s -> 12091.30s]  Grand charm, 11 defense?
[12091.30s -> 12099.32s]  That's, no, that's not good.
[12099.32s -> 12102.80s]  You're looking for plus skills or resistance small charms
[12102.80s -> 12106.43s]  or plus a bunch to life small charms?
[12106.43s -> 12113.42s]  Just trying to help somebody out.
[12113.42s -> 12115.41s]  These are both largest, okay.
[12115.41s -> 12118.50s]  And what is in this one?
[12118.50s -> 12119.34s]  That's that one.
[12119.34s -> 12120.70s]  All right, this one is this.
[12135.66s -> 12137.34s]  What time tomorrow?
[12137.34s -> 12140.62s]  Probably around, somewhere around three or four Pacific.
[12140.62s -> 12142.87s]  Not six.
[12142.87s -> 12146.41s]  I'm gonna shoot for 4 p.m. Pacific.
[12146.41s -> 12148.61s]  I forgot everything that was just going on.
[12148.61s -> 12149.85s]  I'm talking.
[12149.85s -> 12151.62s]  I can't be talking.
[12151.62s -> 12158.00s]  I didn't even put the strawberry in this.
[12158.00s -> 12161.26s]  Okay, this is this one here.
[12161.26s -> 12165.82s]  This one is already over here.
[12165.82s -> 12168.72s]  New topping, whatever that is.
[12168.72s -> 12181.43s]  Atoms, electrons, like what the hell is this?
[12181.43s -> 12189.94s]  Nerds, okay.
[12189.94s -> 12192.81s]  Good, okay.
[12192.85s -> 12198.02s]  I need a medium with Mike and Ike's
[12198.02s -> 12203.55s]  and just another, whatever the vanilla I think it is.
[12203.55s -> 12205.22s]  Put that up there.
[12205.22s -> 12207.34s]  Banana butter is a medium.
[12207.34s -> 12219.43s]  Banana and, yep.
[12219.43s -> 12232.92s]  Okay, whipped cream, let's go.
[12232.92s -> 12248.32s]  I feel like I would really like the taste of these sauces.
[12248.32s -> 12250.40s]  I went to a 100 gecks concert and before the show
[12250.40s -> 12252.40s]  someone was playing your breath of the wild stream
[12252.40s -> 12253.24s]  on their phone.
[12253.24s -> 12260.72s]  What?
[12260.72s -> 12262.53s]  I didn't even select this.
[12262.53s -> 12270.70s]  Isn't that what I wanted?
[12270.70s -> 12272.26s]  It's banana and Reese's.
[12282.41s -> 12283.69s]  Invite some streamer friends over
[12283.69s -> 12287.69s]  and make smoothies like this for them.
[12290.38s -> 12291.22s]  What?
[12291.22s -> 12292.06s]  What's happening?
[12292.06s -> 12292.90s]  Okay, what is this?
[12292.90s -> 12294.57s]  This was this one?
[12294.57s -> 12296.00s]  What is this one?
[12296.00s -> 12308.98s]  This one here, okay.
[12308.98s -> 12310.96s]  Go on, hurry please.
[12310.96s -> 12315.50s]  Hurry up.
[12315.50s -> 12321.13s]  There we go.
[12321.13s -> 12325.21s]  That was $294, $22 tip.
[12325.21s -> 12328.72s]  What?
[12328.72s -> 12338.44s]  Okay.
[12338.44s -> 12342.71s]  I was impressed by your ability to not cuss.
[12342.71s -> 12343.55s]  Still in there.
[12351.24s -> 12352.16s]  Pop there.
[12352.16s -> 12354.98s]  Oh boy, that's a lot.
[12354.98s -> 12356.82s]  Okay.
[12356.82s -> 12359.22s]  This is whipped cream, chocolate and nuts.
[12359.22s -> 12366.53s]  What kind of whipped cream are?
[12366.53s -> 12368.18s]  It was nuts, right?
[12368.18s -> 12375.81s]  Yeah, of course, it's peanuts.
[12375.81s -> 12383.60s]  Free bananas.
[12383.60s -> 12385.00s]  Hey, can you play Cod Zombies with me?
[12385.00s -> 12386.56s]  I have to go to bed soon.
[12386.56s -> 12397.22s]  Sorry, I did medium.
[12399.14s -> 12410.68s]  Strawberry and pop.
[12410.68s -> 12416.24s]  Go off.
[12416.24s -> 12417.91s]  Why does this look incorrect?
[12417.91s -> 12430.93s]  Because it is.
[12430.93s -> 12432.14s]  Was it?
[12432.14s -> 12435.47s]  Was that wrong?
[12435.47s -> 12443.98s]  Wait, what's happening?
[12443.98s -> 12448.31s]  Was it correct?
[12448.31s -> 12452.17s]  Hey dude, can you shout out the New York Mets?
[12452.17s -> 12454.30s]  The New York Mets.
[12454.30s -> 12456.98s]  Let's hope that they do a good job this year.
[12456.98s -> 12460.98s]  Let's see some winning games.
[12460.98s -> 12462.38s]  You guys got it in ya.
[12462.38s -> 12484.51s]  Let's go New York Mets.
[12484.51s -> 12485.59s]  That was really sweet.
[12497.21s -> 12499.61s]  92.
[12499.61s -> 12502.09s]  Can you shout out the Yankees for me real quick?
[12503.93s -> 12505.57s]  Nah, that's not happening.
[12506.85s -> 12508.70s]  That's not happening.
[12508.70s -> 12510.42s]  I don't think so.
[12510.42s -> 12511.26s]  I don't think so.
[12511.26s -> 12516.42s]  Ban that guy, actually.
[12516.42s -> 12518.34s]  Nah, nah, sorry.
[12518.34s -> 12537.02s]  That's not happening here.
[12537.02s -> 12547.25s]  Nice.
[12547.25s -> 12548.09s]  What about the Phillies?
[12548.09s -> 12551.14s]  Yeah, let's go Phillies.
[12551.14s -> 12553.66s]  Come on, Phillies.
[12553.66s -> 12560.98s]  Let's have like 10 games over 500 this year.
[12560.98s -> 12562.22s]  Here we go, Phillies.
[12562.22s -> 12564.07s]  Here we go.
[12564.07s -> 12572.19s]  Oh yeah.
[12572.19s -> 12574.11s]  What about the Minnesota Twins?
[12574.11s -> 12577.53s]  Let's go Twins.
[12577.53s -> 12581.10s]  Minnesota Twins.
[12581.10s -> 12582.94s]  All strikes, all strikes.
[12582.94s -> 12585.42s]  Let's go, go, go.
[12585.42s -> 12586.26s]  Strike them out here.
[12586.26s -> 12587.91s]  Strike them out here.
[12587.91s -> 12595.25s]  Nice, let's go Twins.
[12595.25s -> 12598.66s]  What about the Yankees?
[12598.66s -> 12600.18s]  Yeah, okay.
[12601.54s -> 12602.38s]  Yankees.
[12606.38s -> 12607.78s]  Fuck out of here.
[12607.78s -> 12608.62s]  Get out of here.
[12613.47s -> 12614.31s]  What about the Cubs?
[12614.31s -> 12616.96s]  Oh, my Cubs.
[12616.96s -> 12619.04s]  Of course.
[12619.04s -> 12620.44s]  Of course I will.
[12635.51s -> 12637.07s]  Don't ever say that again.
[12655.74s -> 12662.61s]  They're driving crazily, I'm not.
[12662.61s -> 12663.57s]  This person's trying to kill me.
[12663.57s -> 12669.35s]  Hey, don't forget who makes your Sundays.
[12669.35s -> 12670.39s]  Yeah.
[12670.39s -> 12673.11s]  Rick, whatever your name is.
[12673.11s -> 12675.87s]  You come in every day and get a Sunday.
[12675.87s -> 12682.08s]  You take me out, that's not gonna be a good idea.
[12682.12s -> 12698.90s]  Ooh, I like these.
[12698.90s -> 12711.38s]  I need more holiday spirit, right?
[12711.38s -> 12713.10s]  What holiday is this?
[12716.10s -> 12726.80s]  What holiday am I dressing up for?
[12726.80s -> 12727.96s]  It's the Fourth of July?
[12727.96s -> 12729.32s]  Wait, how did we already get back
[12729.32s -> 12735.03s]  to the Fourth of July again?
[12735.03s -> 12739.65s]  It's been a year?
[12739.65s -> 12748.51s]  It's been like 12 days.
[12748.51s -> 12759.51s]  Hell yeah.
[12759.51s -> 12763.71s]  I don't think I've ever had four on it one time,
[12763.71s -> 12773.93s]  but I'm gonna get it.
[12773.93s -> 12776.77s]  It's the other Fourth of July, oh.
[12776.77s -> 12792.61s]  This town is very patriotic.
[12792.61s -> 12795.81s]  All right, I'm gonna take a beer break.
[12795.81s -> 12800.63s]  We'll do a, I'll come back chilling.
[12800.63s -> 12802.30s]  See you guys in a minute.
[12802.30s -> 12803.58s]  I'm gonna go refill this drink.
[12803.58s -> 12805.30s]  I'm gonna go pee.
[12805.30s -> 13213.51s]  I'll be right back.
[13214.51s -> 13219.25s]  Hello.
[13219.25s -> 13227.58s]  How's it going?
[13227.58s -> 13232.15s]  So I think I might just stick with this.
[13232.15s -> 13234.38s]  There was something else that I was gonna play,
[13234.38s -> 13249.40s]  but I'm just, I'm having a good time.
[13249.40s -> 13252.18s]  We got House Flipper this weekend,
[13252.18s -> 13260.53s]  which I'm really looking forward to playing that.
[13260.53s -> 13264.83s]  90s ads tomorrow.
[13264.83s -> 13271.52s]  And I didn't realize I was streaming for four hours already.
[13271.52s -> 13280.73s]  We'll keep going.
[13280.73s -> 13290.33s]  Without music, this is ominous.
[13290.33s -> 13291.82s]  Did I do this?
[13291.82s -> 13298.27s]  No, I have a lot of upgrades now.
[13298.27s -> 13304.90s]  New customer.
[13305.26s -> 13307.06s]  Did I put on Club Penguin?
[13307.06s -> 13309.72s]  Club Penguin like music?
[13309.72s -> 13314.23s]  Did Club Penguin have a good OST?
[13314.23s -> 13320.82s]  I never played Club Penguin at all.
[13320.82s -> 13327.44s]  70 tracks of Club Penguin.
[13327.44s -> 13333.70s]  This is kind of nice.
[13333.70s -> 13338.66s]  Yeah, I've never played this.
[13338.66s -> 13342.60s]  This kind of fits this game too.
[13342.60s -> 13348.43s]  Oh, that's really cool.
[13348.43s -> 13367.18s]  I don't have to forward anymore.
[13367.18s -> 13368.02s]  Hello.
[13376.26s -> 13378.84s]  Okay, what came out first?
[13378.84s -> 13383.81s]  Club Penguin or World of Warcraft?
[13383.81s -> 13390.06s]  What came out first?
[13390.06s -> 13392.25s]  Did WoW come out first?
[13392.25s -> 13399.15s]  Interesting.
[13399.15s -> 13400.23s]  This is medium.
[13400.23s -> 13402.19s]  Do I have time?
[13402.19s -> 13413.70s]  Oh, no, I don't.
[13413.70s -> 13417.15s]  It's just toppings.
[13417.15s -> 13422.76s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[13422.76s -> 13425.70s]  Get it out the door.
[13425.70s -> 13428.34s]  Was it a year before Club Penguin was 2005?
[13428.34s -> 13429.90s]  Yeah, cause WoW was 2004?
[13431.10s -> 13432.06s]  2003?
[13432.06s -> 13437.85s]  When was WoW?
[13437.85s -> 13439.73s]  Wait, there was a very early Club Penguin version
[13439.73s -> 13441.17s]  that might've been first.
[13441.17s -> 13443.09s]  I'm just trying to figure out if it was the...
[13443.09s -> 13446.29s]  I mean, EverQuest was a really popular MMO,
[13446.29s -> 13450.09s]  but was Club Penguin the first popular MMO?
[13450.09s -> 13465.37s]  How much more popular was Club Penguin than EverQuest?
[13465.37s -> 13468.35s]  I need a large.
[13468.35s -> 13470.03s]  Ultima Online was the first one,
[13470.03s -> 13472.59s]  but I mean like really popular.
[13472.59s -> 13474.47s]  World of Warcraft popped off.
[13474.47s -> 13479.74s]  I feel like Club Penguin popped off big time.
[13479.74s -> 13482.70s]  I'm talking to more than a million concurrent players.
[13482.70s -> 13484.46s]  Was EverQuest more than a million concurrent?
[13484.46s -> 13488.95s]  More than five million concurrent?
[13488.95s -> 13489.79s]  Probably RuneScape?
[13489.79s -> 13492.94s]  Oh, probably RuneScape, yeah.
[13492.94s -> 13495.44s]  All right, hold on.
[13495.48s -> 13497.04s]  This is this one.
[13497.04s -> 13518.72s]  I need that large cup, and then I need a medium.
[13518.72s -> 13521.40s]  Okay, beat this up, let's go.
[13521.40s -> 13522.64s]  Somebody at the door, right?
[13522.64s -> 13529.90s]  Okay, good.
[13529.90s -> 13534.63s]  Coconut, come on, hurry up.
[13534.63s -> 13544.01s]  That's good.
[13544.01s -> 13546.85s]  RuneScape always seemed like a really fun game,
[13546.85s -> 13547.69s]  but for some reason,
[13547.69s -> 13552.22s]  I always felt like it was a lot to take in.
[13552.22s -> 13553.54s]  I feel the same way about RuneScape
[13553.54s -> 13557.38s]  that I do about Path of Exile.
[13557.38s -> 13559.66s]  I see clips of it, I see people playing it,
[13559.66s -> 13561.82s]  and I see the UI, and I see all this shit going on.
[13561.86s -> 13564.97s]  I'm like, hey, this looks kind of,
[13564.97s -> 13565.81s]  is this complicated?
[13565.81s -> 13579.59s]  I don't know, I can't tell.
[13579.59s -> 13590.59s]  I know, I know.
[13590.59s -> 13593.21s]  Try to play RuneScape without the nostalgia.
[13593.21s -> 13601.94s]  RuneScape is pretty simple.
[13601.94s -> 13602.94s]  Does it remind you of Diablo?
[13602.94s -> 13606.30s]  That's why you want to play it?
[13606.30s -> 13610.86s]  No, it just always seemed kind of interesting.
[13610.86s -> 13615.24s]  Okay, we're closed.
[13615.24s -> 13626.05s]  Large, this is strawberry chocolate.
[13626.05s -> 13629.54s]  It's pretty scuffed, but it's all right.
[13629.54s -> 13645.18s]  It's medium.
[13645.18s -> 13649.93s]  Dude, do you even like video games?
[13649.93s -> 13663.01s]  I think so.
[13663.01s -> 13664.01s]  Prove that you do.
[13665.30s -> 13672.29s]  Um, hey, I got 150 kills in a row in the mercenary mode.
[13672.29s -> 13676.10s]  What is, that means I kind of like
[13676.10s -> 13682.86s]  playing video games, doesn't it?
[13682.86s -> 13696.66s]  I like some video games.
[13696.66s -> 13697.50s]  Beat Hades?
[13697.50s -> 13716.32s]  Yeah, whipped cream chocolate.
[13716.32s -> 13719.27s]  Play OSU.
[13719.27s -> 13724.08s]  I feel like I'd be really bad at that game.
[13724.08s -> 13727.68s]  I'm, that's a rhythm game, right?
[13727.68s -> 13729.72s]  Rhythm games I do very well,
[13729.72s -> 13745.27s]  but not if I have to go very, very, very fast.
[13745.27s -> 13751.08s]  Didn't even know this person was here.
[13751.08s -> 13752.52s]  Being good or bad is not the point.
[13752.52s -> 13755.99s]  It's about having fun.
[13755.99s -> 13781.43s]  That's right, I agree.
[13781.43s -> 13787.94s]  It's better if you're good.
[13787.94s -> 13793.61s]  Uh, it depends on the game.
[13793.61s -> 13796.46s]  But yeah, if you play Dark Souls
[13796.46s -> 13799.42s]  and you lose to the first four enemies 100 times,
[13799.42s -> 13814.12s]  then it can get kind of frustrating.
[13814.12s -> 13826.06s]  Like you, I did not, you are changing the record.
[13826.06s -> 13849.53s]  I thought I did a pretty good job on stream.
[13849.53s -> 13850.89s]  How many people do you think actually think
[13850.89s -> 13853.23s]  you died to Pinwheel?
[13853.23s -> 13855.69s]  Probably everybody, because why even,
[13855.69s -> 13856.97s]  well, why would you even argue that?
[13856.97s -> 13861.97s]  Why are we dressed exactly the same?
[13861.97s -> 13864.22s]  That's a weird thing to have to argue.
[13864.42s -> 13866.42s]  Oh, hey, dude, he died at Pinwheel.
[13866.42s -> 13867.26s]  He did?
[13867.26s -> 13868.28s]  Yeah.
[13868.28s -> 13870.51s]  Oh, let me research that.
[13870.51s -> 13871.75s]  No, you're probably just gonna go,
[13871.75s -> 13873.15s]  oh, he sucks, that's funny.
[13888.55s -> 13913.13s]  Actually watch the VOD, the collateral, it's propaganda.
[13913.13s -> 13928.88s]  He did actually die to Pinwheel.
[13928.88s -> 13936.74s]  Better get a new t-shirt for that one.
[13936.74s -> 13946.53s]  Nice.
[13946.53s -> 13948.25s]  Banana butter, berry blast.
[13948.25s -> 13961.28s]  Yep.
[13961.28s -> 13962.30s]  I just took a picture of my sandwich
[13962.30s -> 13964.36s]  because it looked so good.
[13964.36s -> 13968.34s]  Oh, that's cool.
[13968.34s -> 13971.90s]  That's cool.
[13971.90s -> 13975.38s]  Hazelnut swizzle?
[13975.38s -> 13976.22s]  Tiramisu?
[13981.74s -> 13991.60s]  I can surf tiramisu now.
[13991.60s -> 13999.18s]  You want a tiramisu in your, wait, what?
[13999.18s -> 14002.07s]  It seems kind of amazing.
[14002.07s -> 14009.30s]  Tiramisu, vanilla paste, whipped cream, and hazelnut.
[14009.30s -> 14011.87s]  That sounds awesome.
[14011.87s -> 14021.66s]  That sounds really good.
[14021.66s -> 14023.46s]  Still gonna do the courthouse stream?
[14023.46s -> 14029.02s]  No, that's a long, long time away from, that's gone.
[14040.86s -> 14041.86s]  Tiramisu?
[14041.86s -> 14046.38s]  That's how you say it, right?
[14046.38s -> 14054.53s]  I'm saying it, right?
[14054.53s -> 14060.26s]  This one's easy.
[14060.26s -> 14061.58s]  Where are you playing these now?
[14061.58s -> 14067.41s]  There is only one available on Steam at the moment.
[14067.41s -> 14070.49s]  This is Poppa's Freezeria Deluxe.
[14070.49s -> 14071.94s]  It's on Steam.
[14071.94s -> 14073.86s]  I don't know what their plans are for the other ones.
[14073.86s -> 14075.54s]  If they do have any plans, I don't know.
[14075.54s -> 14086.90s]  But this one is on Steam.
[14086.90s -> 14093.15s]  Got it perfect, yeah?
[14093.15s -> 14101.48s]  This one's gonna be done in a second.
[14101.48s -> 14109.61s]  All right, let's go.
[14109.61s -> 14112.87s]  Chocolate whipped cream.
[14112.87s -> 14115.18s]  You know what other games really,
[14115.18s -> 14116.98s]  here's another banger of a game.
[14116.98s -> 14122.33s]  Do you guys remember Hand of Fate?
[14122.33s -> 14128.02s]  That game is awesome.
[14128.06s -> 14131.10s]  I forgot how unbelievably good that game was.
[14131.10s -> 14136.99s]  I feel bad I didn't play it way more.
[14136.99s -> 14138.55s]  There's a second one, yeah.
[14138.55s -> 14139.39s]  This too?
[14148.69s -> 14151.05s]  All right, I don't know how to make a berry blast,
[14151.05s -> 14154.82s]  but we're gonna try in a second here.
[14154.82s -> 14161.36s]  Medium and it's blueberry, strawberry.
[14161.36s -> 14162.20s]  It was amazing.
[14162.20s -> 14167.64s]  I think the developers went out of business, really?
[14167.64s -> 14169.82s]  Did they really?
[14169.82s -> 14185.02s]  That's such a unique game.
[14185.02s -> 14195.31s]  That's a cookie, right?
[14195.31s -> 14197.75s]  I'd like to see you do a RuneScape stream one day.
[14197.75s -> 14200.23s]  Is RuneScape the kind of game where I would open it
[14200.95s -> 14202.83s]  and then like 1,000 people would follow me around
[14202.83s -> 14206.10s]  and kill me for like the two logs that I have?
[14206.10s -> 14209.02s]  Is that gonna happen?
[14209.02s -> 14213.47s]  Probably.
[14213.47s -> 14219.31s]  This is a strawberry, right?
[14219.31s -> 14226.25s]  Yep.
[14226.25s -> 14229.88s]  You would be protected.
[14229.88s -> 14241.47s]  They can't kill you, but they will follow you.
[14241.47s -> 14256.26s]  This is, what is this one?
[14256.26s -> 14258.19s]  Oh, okay, we're good.
[14258.19s -> 14259.43s]  That's berry blast.
[14259.43s -> 14269.23s]  This is tiramisu red velvet.
[14269.23s -> 14272.27s]  I made a character on RuneScape named Jerma Walken
[14272.27s -> 14274.19s]  and made it look like you a year ago.
[14281.03s -> 14293.64s]  This is a nice song.
[14293.64s -> 14294.68s]  This one's coming up.
[14298.27s -> 14299.83s]  Which one's easier?
[14299.83s -> 14300.95s]  Probably this one.
[14300.95s -> 14301.79s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[14301.79s -> 14303.57s]  This one's harder because I don't know.
[14303.57s -> 14304.41s]  It's all right.
[14309.13s -> 14311.16s]  Cream, cream, cream.
[14311.16s -> 14312.00s]  What was it?
[14312.00s -> 14318.96s]  Cream, cream, cream, cream.
[14318.96s -> 14320.40s]  Cream, cream, cream, cream.
[14320.40s -> 14330.78s]  And it was just cream, cream.
[14330.78s -> 14337.91s]  And then nerds.
[14337.91s -> 14341.99s]  And then the wafer, cherry wafer.
[14346.46s -> 14350.74s]  It was the wrong cream.
[14358.34s -> 14361.15s]  This one.
[14361.15s -> 14367.25s]  I got it right.
[14367.25s -> 14370.62s]  Peanuts.
[14370.62s -> 14387.58s]  And then a cinnamon stick.
[14387.58s -> 14394.91s]  This is whipped cream, peanuts.
[14394.91s -> 14399.60s]  And then a cinnamon stick.
[14399.60s -> 14410.99s]  And a cherry, a coffee.
[14410.99s -> 14414.12s]  Are you ever gonna play Pirates of the Caribbean online?
[14414.12s -> 14416.75s]  Years ago, we did an MMO night
[14416.75s -> 14419.91s]  where we played a bunch of free MMOs.
[14419.91s -> 14424.18s]  And it was kind of a disaster.
[14424.18s -> 14433.22s]  It was like five years ago, a long time ago.
[14434.06s -> 14435.26s]  This many years later,
[14435.26s -> 14437.70s]  I wanna say that it would be way harder
[14437.70s -> 14444.40s]  to do a free MMO stream or free to play MMO stream.
[14444.40s -> 14446.84s]  I think back like five years ago or so,
[14446.84s -> 14448.44s]  or whatever it was,
[14448.44s -> 14451.44s]  I think there were like two or 3000 concurrent viewers here
[14451.44s -> 14453.66s]  and that it was already hard.
[14453.66s -> 14458.36s]  If I did that right now, I don't know if that would work.
[14458.36s -> 14462.66s]  It might be hard to do that now.
[14462.66s -> 14473.26s]  It was already hard to do that back then.
[14473.26s -> 14475.62s]  Shit.
[14475.62s -> 14482.66s]  Hold fast, hold fast was a lot of fun.
[14482.66s -> 14484.54s]  Sire, we must do something.
[14484.54s -> 14488.43s]  The enemy is playing copyrighted music at us.
[14488.43s -> 14493.02s]  That's a classic.
[14493.02s -> 14505.31s]  Really, how is that not going in?
[14505.31s -> 14511.30s]  Pizzel?
[14511.30s -> 14525.21s]  They're clowns?
[14525.21s -> 14528.54s]  You're gonna play Project Diva again?
[14528.54s -> 14531.14s]  I think I really got most of what I...
[14531.14s -> 14533.05s]  Played the hell out of that.
[14533.05s -> 14548.37s]  I did like every song three times.
[14548.37s -> 14551.41s]  What's your favorite Minecraft Steve copy?
[14551.41s -> 14554.13s]  Oh my God.
[14561.66s -> 14565.67s]  My brain only works in one fucking direction.
[14565.67s -> 14568.19s]  That person asked me what my favorite ice cream flavor
[14568.19s -> 14569.03s]  and topping was,
[14569.03s -> 14571.91s]  and then they did an emote of Minecraft Steve.
[14571.91s -> 14575.07s]  That's the only thing that I could see.
[14575.07s -> 14580.38s]  Whatever.
[14584.58s -> 14593.97s]  Dude, come on.
[14593.97s -> 14596.25s]  Why did I just do this twice?
[14596.25s -> 14597.13s]  Throw it away.
[14597.13s -> 14611.29s]  Throw this in the trash.
[14611.29s -> 14612.88s]  Shit.
[14613.88s -> 14630.06s]  It made me sound so strange.
[14630.06s -> 14631.02s]  Ooh, it's one of those cookies.
[14631.02s -> 14636.10s]  I like these.
[14636.10s -> 14640.26s]  Have you watched the new Resident Evil movie trailer?
[14640.26s -> 14643.58s]  No, because correct me if I'm wrong here,
[14643.58s -> 14647.72s]  but every Resident Evil movie,
[14647.72s -> 14648.96s]  all of them,
[14648.96s -> 14651.32s]  I feel like have been just,
[14651.32s -> 14655.11s]  like they're not even Resident Evil movies.
[14655.11s -> 14657.31s]  It's like an AI came up with the story
[14657.31s -> 14660.01s]  for what a Resident Evil movie might be.
[14660.01s -> 14660.85s]  And I'm not even,
[14660.85s -> 14662.57s]  I'm not talking like chat GPT three or four.
[14662.57s -> 14666.94s]  I'm talking like chat GPT one.
[14666.94s -> 14673.23s]  Whatever that technology was.
[14673.23s -> 14675.67s]  I have not paid attention to Resident Evil's movies
[14675.67s -> 14678.31s]  in at least a decade or two,
[14678.31s -> 14693.80s]  because they're all seem like kind of weird.
[14693.80s -> 14697.27s]  All right, there's people waiting.
[14697.27s -> 14699.05s]  Need a berry blast.
[14699.05s -> 14706.76s]  That's blueberry and strawberry.
[14706.76s -> 14710.74s]  They are fun garbage.
[14710.74s -> 14711.74s]  I just, I haven't even said,
[14711.74s -> 14717.27s]  I haven't had any interest in them at all.
[14717.27s -> 14720.65s]  Should I watch them?
[14720.65s -> 14721.85s]  I don't really have a,
[14721.85s -> 14722.69s]  I don't really,
[14722.69s -> 14724.33s]  there's a lot of movies I think that are gonna come
[14724.33s -> 14726.30s]  in front of that first,
[14726.30s -> 14733.69s]  if I'm honest.
[14733.69s -> 14735.41s]  Watch the CG movies,
[14735.41s -> 14749.69s]  not the live action ones.
[14749.69s -> 14753.07s]  Come on.
[14753.07s -> 14763.38s]  Perfect timing on this one.
[14763.38s -> 14765.02s]  On some of these,
[14765.02s -> 14767.34s]  I've got like a paragraph complaint here.
[14767.34s -> 14768.18s]  Mr. Elberson,
[14768.18s -> 14770.26s]  if you continue to anger the Steve Jackson
[14770.26s -> 14772.42s]  sorcery enjoyers high council,
[14772.42s -> 14776.26s]  your continuing animosity for sorcery angers us.
[14776.26s -> 14777.10s]  Do not comply,
[14777.10s -> 14777.98s]  there will be dire consequences.
[14777.98s -> 14779.34s]  You have two months, Mr. Elberson,
[14779.34s -> 14781.58s]  to do another stream of the hit adaptation
[14781.58s -> 14782.66s]  of the Choose Your Own Adventure book,
[14782.66s -> 14784.38s]  Steve Jackson's Sorcery,
[14784.38s -> 14786.30s]  created by Inkle Studios.
[14786.30s -> 14788.58s]  The consequences will be severe if you do not comply.
[14788.58s -> 14791.38s]  Sincerely, Steve Jackson sorcery enjoyer high council.
[14793.90s -> 14794.82s]  That's enough time.
[14794.82s -> 14809.12s]  I got two months.
[14809.12s -> 14817.66s]  Here.
[14817.66s -> 14819.75s]  It's not berry.
[14820.83s -> 14822.96s]  Oh, it's this one.
[14822.96s -> 14829.88s]  Oh.
[14829.88s -> 14831.44s]  What about Tears of the Kingdom?
[14834.53s -> 14836.81s]  I have to finish Breath of the Wild.
[14836.81s -> 14840.41s]  There's no world where I just start playing Tears
[14840.41s -> 14842.33s]  of the Kingdom when I have one more Guardian
[14842.33s -> 14844.34s]  to beat in Breath of the Wild.
[14844.34s -> 14846.49s]  You guys would never let me do that.
[14846.49s -> 14858.81s]  I would never let me do that.
[14858.81s -> 14862.59s]  Do you don't get to the last hour
[14862.59s -> 14864.98s]  of a movie that you've been watching?
[14864.98s -> 14877.06s]  Turn the movie off and just play the sequel instead.
[14877.10s -> 14890.59s]  Okay, this is pink, blue, red.
[14890.59s -> 14892.79s]  I haven't had a cotton candy flavored thing
[14892.79s -> 14893.71s]  in a very long time.
[14893.71s -> 14895.07s]  And I know exactly what it tastes like,
[14895.07s -> 14901.11s]  but I forget everything about it.
[14901.11s -> 14902.23s]  Anybody else here get like that?
[14902.23s -> 14903.75s]  Where you almost just want to be reminded
[14903.75s -> 14904.87s]  of a very specific flavor,
[14904.87s -> 14906.71s]  because cotton candy flavoring,
[14906.71s -> 14910.90s]  nothing else is like it on earth.
[14910.90s -> 14913.50s]  I don't know what concoction of weird chemicals it is,
[14913.50s -> 14916.58s]  but it is nothing on earth that it tastes like.
[14916.58s -> 14923.31s]  Only cotton candy flavoring.
[14923.31s -> 14933.22s]  Is it wrong?
[14933.22s -> 14934.06s]  Like sugar?
[14934.06s -> 14937.22s]  No, no, I'm talking cotton candy flavoring.
[14937.22s -> 14938.26s]  The fake cotton candy,
[14938.26s -> 14939.66s]  just like how there's fake banana
[14939.66s -> 14952.43s]  and it does not taste like a banana.
[14952.43s -> 14954.74s]  Bubblegum flavor, yep.
[14954.74s -> 14973.71s]  Now you guys get it.
[14973.71s -> 14974.63s]  I do like banana.
[14974.63s -> 14976.07s]  Banana cream pie is my favorite.
[14976.07s -> 14978.27s]  Oh, somebody wanted to ask what my favorite dessert was.
[14978.27s -> 14979.11s]  Did you?
[14979.11s -> 14980.35s]  I don't know, whatever.
[14980.35s -> 14981.67s]  Banana cream pie.
[14981.67s -> 14985.63s]  S'mores are probably one, two, and three.
[14985.63s -> 14990.70s]  What's the third one?
[14990.70s -> 14998.56s]  Banana cream pie.
[14998.56s -> 15002.86s]  I just tasted artificial cotton candy flavoring right now.
[15002.86s -> 15005.51s]  My brain just made me taste it.
[15005.51s -> 15007.25s]  Interesting.
[15007.25s -> 15009.49s]  Yeah, yep, that's exactly what it tastes like.
[15009.49s -> 15013.62s]  I can taste it right now.
[15013.62s -> 15016.30s]  My brain had to go file a bunch of hard drive stuff
[15016.30s -> 15028.86s]  and find it, but I can taste it.
[15028.86s -> 15034.99s]  Weirdly enough, I can taste the slush version.
[15034.99s -> 15038.07s]  Right now I can taste the slush version
[15038.07s -> 15047.82s]  of a cotton candy slush.
[15047.82s -> 15057.27s]  That's gross.
[15057.27s -> 15058.79s]  Why are you still playing this?
[15058.79s -> 15072.23s]  I don't know, we're just hanging out.
[15072.23s -> 15089.94s]  All right, I messed this one up last time.
[15089.98s -> 15091.94s]  Oh, wait, I can't bump into it from here.
[15091.94s -> 15095.71s]  I thought I could.
[15095.71s -> 15160.82s]  Oops, got it.
[15160.82s -> 15161.82s]  I didn't want to do that.
[15161.82s -> 15168.92s]  There you go.
[15168.92s -> 15175.50s]  I believe his lies, don't forget.
[15175.50s -> 15187.07s]  What are you doing?
[15187.07s -> 15190.22s]  I will play, I will play it.
[15190.22s -> 15191.42s]  I'll play sorcery.
[15194.75s -> 15200.99s]  Okay, you want this chunky.
[15200.99s -> 15202.65s]  Little too much chocolate though.
[15202.65s -> 15206.82s]  I need something to break that up.
[15206.82s -> 15217.62s]  Way too much.
[15217.62s -> 15227.14s]  Get this out quick.
[15227.14s -> 15228.50s]  Play Mega Man Legends 2.
[15230.72s -> 15231.88s]  Is this done?
[15231.88s -> 15234.54s]  It's not, what's, okay, why isn't it?
[15234.54s -> 15237.15s]  It is done.
[15237.15s -> 15253.28s]  I wonder why I didn't answer the phone.
[15254.12s -> 15273.74s]  I have not seen the Mario movie,
[15273.74s -> 15291.75s]  although I very much anticipate seeing it.
[15291.75s -> 15319.11s]  Berry Blast, I watched it today, it was epic.
[15319.11s -> 15322.28s]  You could be a bug, which one would you be?
[15326.10s -> 15328.10s]  What bug lives the longest?
[15328.10s -> 15329.34s]  Because any bug you pick is like,
[15329.34s -> 15342.98s]  you're dead in like fucking four days.
[15342.98s -> 15358.15s]  A cockroach that lives for, how long do they live for?
[15358.15s -> 15360.72s]  They live forever.
[15360.72s -> 15374.82s]  I don't think that's true.
[15374.82s -> 15376.18s]  He's so bad at this.
[15376.18s -> 15380.94s]  I have not had a single bad order in maybe three,
[15381.78s -> 15382.99s]  in four and a half hours.
[15382.99s -> 15395.88s]  I've had three bad orders across 200 or 300 orders.
[15396.00s -> 15420.66s]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[15420.66s -> 15430.30s]  Termite queens live 25 to 50 years.
[15430.30s -> 15435.22s]  Beetle grubs live in the ground for like 16 years.
[15435.22s -> 15438.01s]  Splendor beetle, one of the longest living insects
[15438.01s -> 15439.15s]  in the world.
[15439.15s -> 15442.71s]  An impressive lifespan that averages 31 years.
[15442.71s -> 15445.95s]  With the longest recorded lifespan reaching 51 years,
[15445.95s -> 15460.36s]  I would want to be a Splendor beetle.
[15460.36s -> 15462.64s]  Isn't red velvet just a made up flavor?
[15462.64s -> 15474.91s]  It's not actually anything.
[15474.91s -> 15481.57s]  It's just chocolate right now.
[15481.57s -> 15486.95s]  All right, I gotta go place these.
[15486.95s -> 15490.74s]  It's just beets and chocolate.
[15490.74s -> 15493.06s]  It's supposed to be a cake.
[15493.06s -> 15494.50s]  Yeah, all right, this one's large.
[15494.50s -> 15496.78s]  This one's the medium.
[15496.78s -> 15500.42s]  Okay, so now you need medium.
[15500.42s -> 15510.36s]  This is strawberry banana.
[15510.36s -> 15511.20s]  They're all medium.
[15511.20s -> 15514.14s]  All right, let's go.
[15514.14s -> 15529.35s]  Hold this one off.
[15529.35s -> 15536.57s]  Okay, what is that little thing here?
[15536.57s -> 15543.84s]  A mango or something?
[15543.84s -> 15544.68s]  Oh, come on.
[15551.82s -> 15555.39s]  Shit.
[15555.39s -> 15569.26s]  Oh, that was sloppy.
[15569.26s -> 15574.07s]  Everybody here is ordering these like it's a subway.
[15574.07s -> 15575.07s]  All right, what do you want on it?
[15575.07s -> 15577.43s]  I guess I'll take a banana peppers,
[15578.59s -> 15579.99s]  fucking an oregano.
[15579.99s -> 15582.31s]  I'll give him some oil, maybe some vinegar.
[15582.31s -> 15583.79s]  And maybe, you know what?
[15583.79s -> 15585.91s]  Put like extra lettuce on it, a tomato.
[15587.35s -> 15595.48s]  These orders are all fucked up.
[15595.48s -> 15597.65s]  What kind of cheese do you got?
[15597.65s -> 15598.53s]  Oh, no, I don't care.
[15598.53s -> 15600.62s]  Just put all of them on.
[15600.62s -> 15606.90s]  Just do one slice of every cheese.
[15606.90s -> 15607.74s]  What do I got?
[15607.74s -> 15608.56s]  Cherries?
[15608.56s -> 15609.40s]  Yeah, put one on.
[15609.40s -> 15610.78s]  Cookies too?
[15610.78s -> 15611.93s]  Yeah, fucking.
[15611.93s -> 15612.77s]  What are those things?
[15612.77s -> 15628.82s]  Put it on.
[15628.82s -> 15632.77s]  Banana peppers and ice cream.
[15632.77s -> 15634.29s]  I love banana peppers.
[15634.29s -> 15640.63s]  They're so good.
[15640.63s -> 15643.66s]  You thinking of Quiznos?
[15643.66s -> 15644.86s]  Quiznos.
[15644.86s -> 15653.19s]  Man, I heard sad tale about Quiznos.
[15653.19s -> 15656.59s]  Just, it's just unfortunate.
[15656.59s -> 15660.86s]  That place was unbelievably good.
[15660.86s -> 15662.82s]  Unbelievably good.
[15662.82s -> 15665.33s]  What the hell happened?
[15665.33s -> 15667.83s]  They made the best sandwiches.
[15667.83s -> 15669.83s]  No one can even come close.
[15669.83s -> 15673.98s]  Every other chain sub shop that I've ever been to,
[15673.98s -> 15675.74s]  it was so far behind.
[15675.98s -> 15682.34s]  Literally D and Cs to Quiznos' S.
[15682.34s -> 15683.34s]  No one even comes close.
[15683.34s -> 15684.56s]  I don't wanna hear anybody else.
[15684.56s -> 15687.20s]  I don't wanna hear any of the other restaurants.
[15687.20s -> 15690.64s]  Nope, they don't even come close.
[15690.64s -> 15693.36s]  Honey Bacon Club is the single best chain sandwich
[15693.36s -> 15694.96s]  I've ever had in my life.
[15694.96s -> 15699.74s]  And it's S plus and nothing is even on A.
[15699.74s -> 15703.32s]  There's nothing is even on A.
[15703.32s -> 15705.07s]  Some stuff is on B.
[15705.07s -> 15706.71s]  There's a lot of Bs.
[15706.71s -> 15713.18s]  B pluses, maybe some A minuses, but no.
[15713.18s -> 15714.64s]  You are capping out of your mind.
[15714.64s -> 15716.50s]  It was just as bad as Subway.
[15716.50s -> 15718.02s]  No, no, it was not.
[15718.02s -> 15721.94s]  No way, no way.
[15721.94s -> 15728.79s]  Quiznos was so good.
[15728.79s -> 15731.71s]  I'm just guessing.
[15731.71s -> 15733.41s]  It was barely different.
[15733.41s -> 15735.21s]  You didn't, no, no, you didn't even eat it.
[15735.21s -> 15737.44s]  I don't think you ate it.
[15737.44s -> 15739.45s]  You probably saw it being,
[15739.45s -> 15742.50s]  you probably saw like somebody walking around with it,
[15742.50s -> 15743.34s]  eating it.
[15743.34s -> 15744.16s]  You know what I mean?
[15744.16s -> 15745.00s]  Like the big tube.
[15745.00s -> 15745.94s]  You probably saw somebody eating a tube
[15745.94s -> 15747.42s]  and you're like, I don't know about that.
[15747.42s -> 15749.93s]  You didn't eat it.
[15749.93s -> 15750.77s]  Did you eat it?
[15750.77s -> 15752.79s]  I don't think you did.
[15752.79s -> 15760.78s]  Did you eat it?
[15760.78s -> 15761.62s]  Did you eat it?
[15762.68s -> 15764.59s]  I'm serious.
[15764.59s -> 15769.38s]  I feel like I love Quiznos and I don't love Subway.
[15769.38s -> 15776.05s]  They're very, very distinct for me.
[15776.05s -> 15780.70s]  Corporate fucked over all the ingredient providers.
[15780.70s -> 15782.94s]  Come on.
[15782.94s -> 15794.83s]  Really?
[15794.83s -> 15797.59s]  Double points?
[15797.59s -> 15799.23s]  I promise you I ate it.
[15799.23s -> 15800.07s]  Okay, all right.
[15800.07s -> 15802.35s]  I believe you.
[15802.35s -> 15812.20s]  I believe you.
[15812.20s -> 15813.64s]  They jacked up prices and forced stores
[15813.64s -> 15817.01s]  to buy from the suppliers.
[15817.01s -> 15819.25s]  Can't we just have good yummy sandwiches?
[15819.25s -> 15825.59s]  Like, you know what I'm saying?
[15825.59s -> 15842.46s]  Why can't we just have just delicious sandwiches?
[15842.46s -> 15846.55s]  Just buy a toaster oven, make them at home.
[15846.55s -> 15847.67s]  It's different though.
[15847.67s -> 15849.29s]  I am gonna make a statement here
[15849.29s -> 15853.83s]  and I know a lot of people agree with this.
[15853.83s -> 15855.78s]  It does not matter what the food is.
[15855.78s -> 15857.06s]  It doesn't matter how much I spend on it
[15857.06s -> 15859.46s]  and how much time I spend, how quality the,
[15859.46s -> 15863.81s]  I could buy the highest quality ingredients in the world.
[15863.81s -> 15867.85s]  I could go and get, oh, like delicious Wagyu beef.
[15867.85s -> 15872.18s]  Make a Wagyu beef burger on the grill at your house.
[15872.18s -> 15875.68s]  It is never as good as if somebody else makes it for me.
[15875.68s -> 15876.50s]  Always.
[15876.50s -> 15878.66s]  It is never as good.
[15878.66s -> 15882.38s]  I could follow a recipe to a tea, take a bite out of it
[15882.38s -> 15883.99s]  and go, this sucks.
[15883.99s -> 15885.90s]  I did something wrong.
[15885.90s -> 15887.42s]  When somebody else does the same thing
[15887.42s -> 15889.02s]  and makes it for me, right?
[15889.02s -> 15892.49s]  Whether it's a restaurant, it's always better.
[15892.49s -> 15896.30s]  It just always is better than me, way better than me.
[15896.30s -> 15899.47s]  And I've come to accept that.
[15899.47s -> 15900.59s]  Like you're just doing this way.
[15900.59s -> 15904.19s]  You just, you're doing something way better than I am.
[15904.19s -> 15924.22s]  So yeah, let's get this out.
[15924.22s -> 15926.96s]  I think it's because you're afraid of ovens.
[15926.96s -> 15939.68s]  You still cook with an oven.
[15939.68s -> 15943.41s]  I bet you like unsalted butter.
[15943.41s -> 15945.65s]  And it's appropriate places to use it.
[15945.65s -> 15952.11s]  It should be used.
[15952.11s -> 15952.95s]  How's this?
[15952.95s -> 15954.60s]  This is a weird combo.
[15956.56s -> 15977.18s]  All right, I still haven't made this large.
[15977.18s -> 15985.76s]  None of these are, okay, this one's done.
[15985.76s -> 15987.12s]  Is this the right one?
[15987.12s -> 15996.12s]  Oh, shut up.
[15996.12s -> 15999.18s]  We ran out of pink whipped cream.
[15999.18s -> 16011.40s]  Sorry.
[16011.40s -> 16012.68s]  Is there something wrong with unsalted butter?
[16012.68s -> 16016.24s]  I don't know what the hell, what's the deal?
[16016.24s -> 16019.28s]  Uh-oh, I'm starting to lose control here.
[16019.28s -> 16026.86s]  This is this one, I'm losing control.
[16026.86s -> 16028.78s]  Oh my goodness, I've lost control.
[16032.36s -> 16042.06s]  Strawberries, okay, hurry up.
[16042.06s -> 16049.13s]  Okay, hurry up.
[16049.17s -> 16070.61s]  Really not even that bad for having the wrong whipped cream.
[16070.61s -> 16074.51s]  I love food though.
[16074.51s -> 16076.94s]  I could be having a really bad day
[16076.94s -> 16080.46s]  and just a nice delicious meal.
[16080.46s -> 16092.79s]  Just changes everything, it really does.
[16092.79s -> 16093.63s]  Are you a good cook?
[16093.63s -> 16095.86s]  No.
[16095.86s -> 16098.18s]  I know how to make a few things.
[16098.18s -> 16105.90s]  That's it.
[16105.90s -> 16107.70s]  I can make a good fish.
[16107.70s -> 16109.70s]  I can make a good salmon in the oven.
[16109.70s -> 16122.73s]  I can make a good cod in the pan.
[16122.73s -> 16125.02s]  I like fish.
[16125.02s -> 16137.52s]  Fish sandwiches, pretty easy.
[16137.52s -> 16140.72s]  Egg salad, egg salad's not necessarily cooking
[16140.72s -> 16143.16s]  as much as it's putting something together.
[16144.04s -> 16147.04s]  I mean, I guess technically you are cooking something.
[16147.04s -> 16148.82s]  You cook the eggs.
[16148.82s -> 16149.66s]  You know what, I'm gonna own that.
[16149.66s -> 16151.02s]  Yeah, it's good.
[16151.02s -> 16153.17s]  My recipe is phenomenal.
[16153.17s -> 16163.85s]  Yeah, I'm gonna own that because it's good, it's true.
[16163.85s -> 16166.42s]  What is this thing?
[16166.42s -> 16167.58s]  Okay, I need sprinkles.
[16171.22s -> 16178.85s]  There's not been one bad review of that recipe, by the way.
[16178.85s -> 16194.55s]  Coconut, and there's been zero reviews.
[16194.55s -> 16200.05s]  There's been at least five or 10.
[16200.05s -> 16215.18s]  There's been at least five or 10.
[16215.22s -> 16230.82s]  Peanuts and then double stick curry.
[16230.82s -> 16232.95s]  What's wrong with this?
[16232.95s -> 16241.70s]  Blend it too much?
[16241.70s -> 16243.38s]  Oh my God, scared of it.
[16243.38s -> 16245.74s]  What is this one?
[16245.74s -> 16247.69s]  This one doesn't, I don't even know what that,
[16247.69s -> 16263.58s]  okay, let's make two more.
[16263.58s -> 16280.20s]  This is banana.
[16280.20s -> 16284.76s]  Please try.
[16284.76s -> 16286.92s]  Did you get permission to leak the family egg recipe
[16286.92s -> 16290.25s]  or was it a Prometheus?
[16290.25s -> 16294.53s]  What's that reference to?
[16294.53s -> 16309.47s]  I don't know what that means.
[16309.47s -> 16319.68s]  There we go.
[16319.68s -> 16322.87s]  The reference to the Bible.
[16322.91s -> 16327.11s]  Sorry, I have not kept up with my Bible studies.
[16327.11s -> 16336.56s]  What is, it's a Prometheus is stole fire from the gods
[16337.08s -> 16338.88s]  and gave it to man.
[16338.88s -> 16339.80s]  He got punished for it.
[16339.80s -> 16341.24s]  I think he had to have his liver eaten
[16341.24s -> 16342.60s]  by a raven every day.
[16349.62s -> 16355.15s]  Well, that didn't happen.
[16355.15s -> 16357.87s]  Do you mean am I getting a lot of flack
[16357.87s -> 16360.63s]  from my family for leaking the recipe?
[16360.63s -> 16377.30s]  I think that's where you're going with that, right?
[16377.30s -> 16386.56s]  Ooh, that's a good one.
[16386.56s -> 16389.76s]  Hey, you do know that a secret family recipe
[16389.76s -> 16394.14s]  can start at any generation.
[16394.14s -> 16398.69s]  Who's to say it didn't start with me?
[16398.69s -> 16401.77s]  You think there's some great dear old great grandma
[16401.77s -> 16404.67s]  or grandpa that I got that from?
[16404.67s -> 16405.87s]  Who'd be starting here?
[16405.87s -> 16408.61s]  I am the great grandpa.
[16408.61s -> 16417.55s]  I am the secret recipe, you understand?
[16417.55s -> 16425.58s]  Gotta leave something, right?
[16425.58s -> 16430.01s]  I'm gonna take a bunch of pictures of me in chef outfits
[16430.01s -> 16431.61s]  just to make sure that this, you know,
[16431.65s -> 16432.45s]  they can look back and be like,
[16432.45s -> 16435.65s]  oh, great, great, great, great grandpa Jerma.
[16435.65s -> 16438.21s]  I mean, there's a lot of pictures of him in chef hats.
[16438.21s -> 16440.45s]  He must have been a chef of some kind.
[16440.45s -> 16448.74s]  Why would he take photos like this?
[16448.74s -> 16449.74s]  That's hard.
[16449.74s -> 16458.34s]  That one was really, really hard.
[16458.34s -> 16461.53s]  There's a ton of green screen footage of you.
[16461.53s -> 16462.77s]  That's fine.
[16462.77s -> 16465.78s]  That was in my younger years.
[16465.78s -> 16469.75s]  I'm gonna take these photos when I'm like 60.
[16469.75s -> 16481.14s]  Oh my goodness, what a disaster.
[16481.14s -> 16500.48s]  That was a nice song.
[16500.48s -> 16502.80s]  If I walked in and this is all here,
[16502.80s -> 16504.52s]  don't you think that the people that were working here
[16504.52s -> 16508.62s]  were moving?
[16508.62s -> 16515.85s]  They're like, oh, it's like this because they're moving soon.
[16515.85s -> 16517.37s]  This is pretty good Kickstarter music.
[16517.37s -> 16538.55s]  What do you mean?
[16538.55s -> 16540.15s]  Mr. Elberson, this is Steve Jackson's
[16540.15s -> 16541.95s]  Sorcery Enjoyers High Council.
[16541.95s -> 16544.67s]  That thing got removed in a second.
[16544.67s -> 16546.51s]  You can't post that more than once.
[16546.51s -> 16551.92s]  Although that doesn't get posted more than once.
[16551.92s -> 16557.65s]  I'm only gonna read that once.
[16557.65s -> 16558.73s]  It was different?
[16558.73s -> 16568.43s]  No, oh well.
[16568.43s -> 16570.03s]  You've asked this question like 30 times.
[16570.03s -> 16573.63s]  Do I eat sludge?
[16573.63s -> 16576.83s]  Well, that depends on your definition.
[16576.83s -> 16580.17s]  Is oatmeal sludge?
[16580.21s -> 16591.50s]  Let's break this down and talk about this.
[16591.50s -> 16613.47s]  And the answer is yes, then.
[16613.47s -> 16619.01s]  All right, speed this one up.
[16619.01s -> 16619.93s]  What about slop?
[16622.18s -> 16623.54s]  If sludge is oatmeal,
[16623.54s -> 16627.50s]  we're considering that oatmeal is like thicker.
[16627.50s -> 16629.62s]  Sludge to me is a little thicker.
[16629.62s -> 16631.71s]  Slop is runny.
[16631.71s -> 16638.59s]  What would be runny?
[16638.59s -> 16639.43s]  Chili?
[16641.03s -> 16648.24s]  Chili might fall more into the sludge category, I think.
[16648.24s -> 16657.43s]  I need this one.
[16657.43s -> 16658.87s]  And then three cones.
[16658.87s -> 16660.23s]  At least cones are like waffle.
[16660.23s -> 16673.28s]  What is this?
[16674.98s -> 16677.14s]  Chowder is kind of slop.
[16677.14s -> 16679.06s]  I could see that.
[16679.06s -> 16682.09s]  I could see how that, you could see that.
[16682.09s -> 16692.36s]  Cannoli?
[16692.36s -> 16698.54s]  There we are.
[16698.54s -> 16703.22s]  The oatmeal depends on consistency, yeah.
[16703.22s -> 16705.10s]  You know what I haven't had in a long time?
[16705.10s -> 16707.14s]  It's a good fish chowder.
[16707.14s -> 16709.42s]  Clam chowder, F.
[16709.42s -> 16712.18s]  Fish chowder, A+.
[16712.18s -> 16715.67s]  Corn chowder, B.
[16715.67s -> 16717.88s]  Clam chowder is an F for me.
[16717.88s -> 16719.52s]  Fish chowder is an S.
[16719.52s -> 16725.90s]  It's an A+.
[16725.90s -> 16729.32s]  I don't like clams.
[16729.32s -> 16731.04s]  I never was a fan of clams or oysters.
[16731.04s -> 16741.40s]  Anything in the shell, really, besides maybe crab.
[16741.40s -> 16742.80s]  Clams are too rubbery.
[16742.80s -> 16745.36s]  Yeah, I feel like, I don't like it.
[16745.36s -> 16752.55s]  It's too weird.
[16752.55s -> 16754.03s]  Clams are rubbery.
[16754.03s -> 16756.79s]  I don't, no, I don't like squid either, or octopus.
[16756.79s -> 16760.43s]  No, thanks.
[16760.43s -> 16761.79s]  If you're one of those people that goes,
[16761.79s -> 16766.30s]  hey, let's get a calamari for the table.
[16766.30s -> 16767.98s]  I always kind of feel like, fuck,
[16767.98s -> 16769.02s]  I'm not gonna eat any of that.
[16769.02s -> 16770.70s]  And people are gonna be, you're gonna be looking over,
[16770.70s -> 16773.46s]  hey, you want those, you want any pieces?
[16773.46s -> 16775.98s]  There's like five or six pieces of calamari left.
[16775.98s -> 16777.78s]  Like, no, you can eat it.
[16777.78s -> 16779.70s]  Well, I already had like seven or eight pieces.
[16779.70s -> 16783.10s]  I'm not, I wanna leave room for my entree.
[16783.10s -> 16801.12s]  Like, oh, oops.
[16801.12s -> 16803.30s]  I have eaten calamari before.
[16803.30s -> 16806.58s]  That was very, very, very, very good.
[16806.58s -> 16808.26s]  It was perfect.
[16808.26s -> 16810.38s]  But I've also eaten calamari before.
[16810.38s -> 16812.14s]  That made me want to never eat it ever again
[16812.14s -> 16813.38s]  for the rest of my life.
[16813.38s -> 16818.54s]  So I'm sorry, that's too much of a range for me.
[16818.54s -> 16835.58s]  It's just too much of a range.
[16835.58s -> 16836.42s]  Hey, hold on.
[16840.02s -> 16842.22s]  Dude, your stream really is a food podcast.
[16842.22s -> 16846.91s]  I could talk about food all day.
[16846.91s -> 16850.23s]  Don't be surprised if I like fucking retire
[16850.23s -> 16853.91s]  and I have like an old man food podcast.
[16853.91s -> 16857.91s]  Today, where I go and I tried this restaurant today
[16857.91s -> 16862.43s]  and it was called Spaghetti for Two or whatever.
[16862.43s -> 16863.35s]  And it was delicious.
[16863.35s -> 16866.18s]  And let me tell you what I ordered.
[16866.18s -> 16867.42s]  Would you watch that?
[16867.42s -> 16873.00s]  Would you listen to it?
[16873.00s -> 16875.76s]  I will say I was not a huge fan
[16875.80s -> 16877.92s]  of the crust of the bread.
[16877.92s -> 16880.16s]  The crust of the bread to me needs to be brown
[16880.16s -> 16882.52s]  on the underneath, but soft on the top.
[16882.52s -> 16886.12s]  And it was fucking disgusting that they didn't do that.
[16886.12s -> 16889.83s]  And I will never go back to this place ever again.
[16889.83s -> 16892.39s]  The tomato sauce was high quality.
[16893.87s -> 16896.11s]  Server didn't remember my name.
[16896.11s -> 16898.99s]  So they are obviously, I'm gonna have to give minus
[16898.99s -> 16910.39s]  a full star for that one.
[16910.39s -> 16913.90s]  Wait, that's wrong.
[16913.90s -> 16925.81s]  It's done.
[16925.81s -> 16931.85s]  What, it wasn't mixed enough?
[16931.85s -> 16934.81s]  Angry grumpy spoiled old man rants about food
[16934.81s -> 16939.04s]  and dies of a heart attack in the middle of the podcast.
[16939.04s -> 16940.08s]  That's like sad.
[16940.08s -> 16942.48s]  I don't wanna think about that.
[16942.48s -> 16952.66s]  I don't wanna have that thought in my head.
[16952.66s -> 16955.68s]  And when I went there, you don't understand.
[16955.68s -> 16958.90s]  I dropped my napkin on the ground
[16958.90s -> 16962.86s]  and it wasn't replaced within one minute.
[16967.32s -> 16969.04s]  I don't think I wanna live that life, right?
[16969.04s -> 16976.85s]  No, I don't know.
[16976.85s -> 16983.25s]  This person's wanted this Calypso coconut thing.
[16983.29s -> 16984.29s]  Should I go out there and just say,
[16984.29s -> 16985.73s]  hey, listen, I'm sorry.
[16985.73s -> 16988.00s]  I don't know how to make that.
[16988.00s -> 16992.12s]  I know you saw some like TikTok video of the secret menu,
[16992.12s -> 16999.26s]  but I don't know what the fuck this is.
[16999.26s -> 17014.74s]  Okay, I think I do know what it is.
[17014.74s -> 17015.58s]  There we go.
[17026.21s -> 17027.97s]  Remember you use TikTok?
[17027.97s -> 17032.32s]  No, I just pretend to to fit in.
[17032.32s -> 17033.88s]  I have to be like aware of it.
[17033.88s -> 17045.26s]  Come on.
[17045.26s -> 17046.14s]  Anybody else in line?
[17046.14s -> 17048.58s]  No.
[17048.58s -> 17054.54s]  All right, so it's blue coconut, blue sprinkles.
[17054.54s -> 17055.98s]  This thing does look really good though.
[17055.98s -> 17075.74s]  I would eat this one.
[17075.90s -> 17078.06s]  I've been really too timid with that.
[17078.06s -> 17086.36s]  That was almost a perfect four.
[17086.36s -> 17096.70s]  This one looks really good.
[17096.70s -> 17109.74s]  That's my best one yet, I think.
[17109.74s -> 17112.63s]  What about deep dish pizza?
[17112.63s -> 17114.70s]  I like a thinner crust.
[17114.70s -> 17119.94s]  Deep dish pizza to me is a lasagna.
[17119.94s -> 17121.78s]  Lasagna is delicious.
[17121.78s -> 17124.80s]  Deep dish pizza is delicious,
[17124.80s -> 17131.82s]  but I prefer a thinner crust.
[17131.82s -> 17133.86s]  If you could preserve any existing food menu items
[17133.86s -> 17135.30s]  so that it would be available forever,
[17135.30s -> 17136.14s]  what would you pick?
[17136.14s -> 17138.23s]  Cheese agridita crunch from Taco Bell.
[17138.23s -> 17160.54s]  The aliens would have to eat that at some point.
[17160.54s -> 17164.22s]  You know how a lot of times I'm a little bit older
[17164.22s -> 17167.14s]  and maybe some of you are also in this after 30
[17167.18s -> 17169.91s]  or even if you're in your mid to late 20s.
[17169.91s -> 17172.35s]  You know there's that food item that you look back,
[17172.35s -> 17174.67s]  oh my God, all the nostalgia videos of,
[17174.67s -> 17176.72s]  imagine if this was still a thing.
[17176.72s -> 17179.18s]  I am so glad that the cheesy agridita crunch
[17179.18s -> 17182.74s]  from when I was like 13 to all the way to now,
[17182.74s -> 17184.47s]  it's been the exact same.
[17184.47s -> 17185.71s]  I'm so happy that I don't have to think
[17185.71s -> 17189.37s]  about where that went.
[17189.37s -> 17190.57s]  That is one of those items
[17190.57s -> 17192.77s]  that if it was gone 10 years ago,
[17192.77s -> 17194.17s]  I would be desperately talking
[17194.17s -> 17199.19s]  about how much I wish I could eat one,
[17199.19s -> 17200.55s]  but I don't have to think like that
[17200.55s -> 17205.28s]  because it's available and I'm gonna fail this one.
[17205.28s -> 17220.51s]  Good luck, excuse me.
[17220.51s -> 17236.82s]  I almost have it, come on man.
[17236.82s -> 17243.20s]  There's not enough fucking time to do this.
[17243.20s -> 17248.84s]  I got it, okay good.
[17248.84s -> 17251.76s]  Calm down with the come on mans.
[17251.76s -> 17256.58s]  Am I doing that a lot?
[17256.58s -> 17272.52s]  Do I say come on man a lot?
[17272.52s -> 17283.61s]  A and B button.
[17283.61s -> 17286.35s]  Oh, this is all the customers.
[17286.35s -> 17298.18s]  Who have I served the most?
[17298.18s -> 17304.59s]  I feel like I've served way more than this.
[17304.59s -> 17320.32s]  Maybe not, okay.
[17320.32s -> 17329.83s]  I wanna get this hat off.
[17329.83s -> 17333.10s]  Willy Wonka chocolate factory.
[17333.10s -> 17361.69s]  Willy Wonka wear purple.
[17361.69s -> 17364.05s]  The Willy Wonka stream is something else
[17364.05s -> 17366.79s]  I really wish I was able to do at some point.
[17366.79s -> 17384.57s]  It would have been so much fun.
[17384.57s -> 17387.82s]  There's still time.
[17387.86s -> 17391.70s]  Yeah, but I really, you know,
[17391.70s -> 17395.94s]  you're talking like you can't do it now.
[17395.94s -> 17422.71s]  No, but no.
[17422.71s -> 17436.01s]  Did I do this one right?
[17436.01s -> 17439.86s]  What a health and safety nightmare.
[17439.86s -> 17441.26s]  Well, all right, let me,
[17441.26s -> 17443.82s]  okay, let me be realistic.
[17443.82s -> 17446.58s]  A lot of times I'll come up with something that I wanna do
[17446.58s -> 17447.98s]  and then realize to do it right
[17447.98s -> 17452.73s]  will be hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[17452.73s -> 17455.65s]  So I go, oh, okay, that sounds fun.
[17455.65s -> 17457.42s]  How do I do that?
[17457.42s -> 17458.94s]  How do I be able to like afford that
[17458.94s -> 17460.42s]  and not lose everything?
[17474.30s -> 17494.45s]  Oh, and also stuff like that.
[17494.45s -> 17499.28s]  I think the reason why a lot of you like the kind of show
[17499.28s -> 17502.74s]  in quote streams or the event type streams
[17502.74s -> 17505.62s]  is because I'm doing those when I really want to.
[17505.62s -> 17506.90s]  And it's like, I am super excited.
[17506.90s -> 17507.86s]  I'm super passionate about it.
[17507.86s -> 17510.85s]  I wanna go for it as hard as I can.
[17510.85s -> 17512.25s]  I think that's probably why
[17512.25s -> 17514.77s]  is they don't have to happen all the time.
[17514.77s -> 17517.89s]  It's not something, oh, wow, I can't like every 30 days,
[17517.89s -> 17521.24s]  there's gotta be something fucking crazy.
[17521.24s -> 17525.26s]  I wanna steer away from that
[17525.30s -> 17528.22s]  because I feel like over the last year,
[17528.22s -> 17537.72s]  I've really tried to do that.
[17537.72s -> 17541.81s]  And you're watching right now,
[17541.81s -> 17548.72s]  I think part of the stream that I was maybe missing
[17548.72s -> 17572.24s]  for me at least.
[17572.24s -> 17577.13s]  Just make the smoothies, man, it's all right.
[17577.13s -> 17579.05s]  You should do whatever makes you happy.
[17579.05s -> 17585.45s]  This makes me happy right now.
[17585.45s -> 17586.97s]  And who knows, I don't know.
[17586.97s -> 17588.57s]  There are other things that are making me really happy.
[17588.57s -> 17592.49s]  Obviously the Grotto Beast project is a lot of work
[17592.49s -> 17594.09s]  and a lot of time went into that.
[17594.09s -> 17596.05s]  There's a lot of things to still show.
[17597.69s -> 17598.97s]  So that's really exciting.
[17600.50s -> 17607.14s]  But I gotta be all in, I have to be all in.
[17607.14s -> 17614.09s]  And I definitely think it's best to pull back.
[17614.09s -> 17615.41s]  This is correct, right?
[17615.41s -> 17625.44s]  No, it's not, throw it away.
[17625.44s -> 17627.44s]  I didn't even start that, wait, what is this one?
[17627.44s -> 17635.27s]  Oh shit, hold on, this one's easy.
[17635.27s -> 17638.11s]  Really like these no cam chill streams.
[17638.11s -> 17641.20s]  Yeah, so do I.
[17641.20s -> 17649.83s]  So do I.
[17649.83s -> 17654.85s]  We have elementary school dork taste in games.
[17654.85s -> 17657.61s]  This is, isn't this like half of everybody in this chat's
[17657.65s -> 17662.44s]  like favorite, one of like favorite Flash series?
[17662.44s -> 17668.59s]  I thought I was being a pleaser today.
[17668.59s -> 17671.34s]  Okay, is this one?
[17682.26s -> 17685.48s]  This is still Club Penguin, this is great.
[17685.48s -> 17687.56s]  This is very inoffensive music.
[17687.56s -> 17692.92s]  It just feels good to play it.
[17692.92s -> 17699.69s]  Just hanging out in the background.
[17699.69s -> 17703.13s]  All right, I need two mediums.
[17703.13s -> 17710.59s]  Strawberry and then strawberry lemonade.
[17710.59s -> 17714.22s]  This is Wii Sports music, it kind of is.
[17714.22s -> 17724.31s]  All right, it's cake, cake and blue.
[17724.35s -> 17726.97s]  You thought about doing some more small scale stuff?
[17726.97s -> 17731.60s]  Yes, you'll see.
[17731.60s -> 17752.22s]  The answer to that question is yes.
[17752.22s -> 17758.49s]  Cause I gotta be careful.
[17758.49s -> 17760.65s]  I can get really, really into stuff
[17760.65s -> 17764.64s]  and then be like, wow, I just only wanna do that.
[17764.64s -> 17767.78s]  And then I could get myself into a lot of trouble
[17767.78s -> 17774.61s]  if I don't be careful with that.
[17774.61s -> 17783.50s]  There we go.
[17783.50s -> 17786.30s]  But when I say trouble, I mean,
[17786.30s -> 17788.98s]  doing a bunch of streams that are big, big, big, bigger,
[17788.98s -> 17790.50s]  it's gotta be bigger, it's gotta be crazier,
[17790.50s -> 17793.46s]  it's gotta be even more ridiculous.
[17793.46s -> 17797.14s]  I mean, I'll just start blowing money left and right.
[17797.14s -> 17803.98s]  And sponsors can help, but it's never,
[17803.98s -> 17807.06s]  I obviously wanna make sure that,
[17807.06s -> 17808.78s]  is this the, did I do this wrong?
[17808.78s -> 17819.09s]  No, this is correct.
[17819.09s -> 17821.29s]  Have you lost passion over the years for streaming?
[17821.29s -> 17827.30s]  No, I don't think that's true.
[17827.30s -> 17830.38s]  I think, cause I've been doing it for long enough
[17830.38s -> 17835.48s]  that I can kind of cyclically go through different phases
[17835.48s -> 17838.32s]  and keep myself interested.
[17838.32s -> 17840.60s]  So that, I mean, that's really important.
[17840.64s -> 17872.86s]  What, oh, sprinkles, coconut, and then that.
[17872.86s -> 17874.82s]  This dude can't remember a color from more than two seconds.
[17874.82s -> 17893.06s]  No, I can't, it's true.
[17893.06s -> 17897.47s]  Level 13, yes.
[17897.47s -> 17899.12s]  What about Toontown?
[17899.12s -> 17902.99s]  I was gonna play Toontown a while ago, just never did.
[17908.10s -> 17922.62s]  There was a reason why it didn't, I forget what it was.
[17922.62s -> 17935.30s]  No, you would crash Toontown so bad.
[17935.30s -> 17942.90s]  Maybe the end, maybe that is what happened.
[17942.90s -> 17944.46s]  Do you ever get burnt out?
[17944.46s -> 17949.56s]  Um, yeah.
[17949.56s -> 17951.97s]  That's a hard one to answer because I,
[17952.01s -> 17955.11s]  I know the joke here is that I don't stream that often,
[17955.11s -> 17956.63s]  but that's very specifically to make sure
[17956.63s -> 17967.50s]  that does not happen.
[17967.50s -> 17971.83s]  What was that?
[17971.83s -> 17973.35s]  Like I, sometimes I might just disappear
[17973.35s -> 17975.11s]  for like four or five straight days.
[17975.11s -> 17984.83s]  That happens pretty frequently here.
[17984.83s -> 17985.99s]  Get out of the way.
[17985.99s -> 17986.81s]  How is this fair?
[17986.81s -> 17988.91s]  There's been no coins on the bottom or top
[17988.91s -> 18005.18s]  and they've been hogging the middle.
[18005.18s -> 18011.90s]  When are you gonna finally retire?
[18011.90s -> 18015.90s]  I will tell you, retirement on this channel
[18015.90s -> 18017.34s]  is gonna be soft.
[18017.34s -> 18029.75s]  It would be a soft retirement.
[18029.75s -> 18031.35s]  And what does that mean by soft retirement?
[18031.35s -> 18035.55s]  That means I'm not gonna stop.
[18035.55s -> 18042.92s]  I don't think I ever will be able to.
[18042.92s -> 18045.69s]  Cryptic Andy?
[18045.69s -> 18046.55s]  No, I'm just saying like,
[18046.55s -> 18047.97s]  it's not gonna be a case where it's like,
[18047.97s -> 18050.98s]  oh, by the way, I am retired.
[18050.98s -> 18052.30s]  Twitch is deleted, YouTube is deleted,
[18052.30s -> 18054.18s]  and my Twitter's gone and you never hear,
[18054.18s -> 18070.32s]  I literally never, you don't hear from me ever again.
[18070.32s -> 18077.88s]  You should transition to Battletoads.
[18077.88s -> 18078.80s]  Battletoads is sick.
[18078.80s -> 18094.56s]  That's not a bad idea.
[18094.56s -> 18096.97s]  No, I'm such a fucking clown.
[18096.97s -> 18098.93s]  It would be embarrassing
[18098.93s -> 18101.46s]  because I would be like, oh, I'm retired.
[18101.46s -> 18102.54s]  And then like a month later,
[18102.54s -> 18106.34s]  Durba is coming out of retirement to do this.
[18106.34s -> 18121.34s]  No, we'll call it a soft retirement whenever that is.
[18121.34s -> 18123.18s]  I gotta have my food podcast eventually.
[18123.18s -> 18137.54s]  Come on.
[18137.54s -> 18138.62s]  Did I do this one wrong?
[18138.62s -> 18140.24s]  Is it the wrong size?
[18140.24s -> 18147.51s]  No, that's good.
[18147.51s -> 18150.57s]  Will we know when the soft retirement has started?
[18150.57s -> 18153.28s]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[18153.28s -> 18155.16s]  I wouldn't keep you guys completely in the dark over that.
[18155.16s -> 18164.03s]  That'd be weird.
[18164.03s -> 18164.87s]  We got a new ingredient.
[18164.87s -> 18165.71s]  Oh, Pog.
[18169.55s -> 18177.72s]  It's crispy dots, whatever they are.
[18177.72s -> 18179.16s]  Monthly retirement conversation?
[18179.20s -> 18180.44s]  That's not true.
[18180.44s -> 18182.00s]  That's not true.
[18182.00s -> 18182.84s]  We have not talked about this
[18182.84s -> 18185.32s]  in probably at least four to six months.
[18185.32s -> 18201.86s]  That's not true.
[18201.86s -> 18204.02s]  Thoughts on Dippin' Dots ice cream of the future.
[18204.02s -> 18206.50s]  S plus.
[18206.50s -> 18211.26s]  The first time I ate Dippin' Dots, I was a kid,
[18211.26s -> 18214.41s]  and I think my eyes were gonna bug out of my head.
[18214.41s -> 18220.91s]  It was one of the greatest experiences of my entire life.
[18220.91s -> 18225.54s]  If there was a video camera back then,
[18225.54s -> 18226.98s]  and like my mother took,
[18226.98s -> 18228.66s]  or like my parents took a video of me
[18228.66s -> 18230.71s]  eating Dippin' Dots for the first time,
[18230.71s -> 18233.40s]  it probably would be a meme right now.
[18233.72s -> 18237.88s]  A decade, two decades, three decades later.
[18237.88s -> 18238.72s]  It'd be one of those like,
[18238.72s -> 18244.06s]  look at this little kid does something really funny.
[18244.06s -> 18258.32s]  Okay, I need a large and medium.
[18258.32s -> 18261.04s]  Chocolate.
[18261.04s -> 18263.32s]  You lied about watching Mob Psycho 100.
[18263.32s -> 18265.36s]  Oh shit, somebody actually remembered that.
[18267.83s -> 18292.30s]  When's your birthday?
[18292.30s -> 18297.82s]  The Dippin' Dots kid finally plays Papa's Freezeria.
[18297.82s -> 18305.23s]  That's me.
[18305.23s -> 18312.06s]  The Dippin' Dots kid.
[18312.06s -> 18316.62s]  All of my merchandise would have to be like that picture
[18316.62s -> 18324.35s]  or that screenshot of my reaction to eating the Dippin' Dots
[18324.35s -> 18325.19s]  at all the conventions
[18325.19s -> 18328.51s]  that everyone would want me to do the face.
[18328.51s -> 18330.15s]  Like do the brain freeze face.
[18340.86s -> 18343.37s]  Dippin' Dots tier list.
[18343.37s -> 18345.25s]  I don't, can you even buy Dippin' Dots?
[18345.25s -> 18346.50s]  Do they even?
[18346.50s -> 18349.62s]  To me, Dippin' Dots are in a machine in a mall.
[18349.62s -> 18360.21s]  There's no story, where do you get them?
[18360.21s -> 18362.13s]  All right, what do I gotta say?
[18362.13s -> 18366.86s]  What's this?
[18366.86s -> 18370.50s]  This one here.
[18370.50s -> 18374.39s]  Get them online and deliver them?
[18374.39s -> 18377.31s]  How do they, is it packaged in like a freezer?
[18377.31s -> 18378.83s]  How do they make sure it gets there?
[18378.87s -> 18383.86s]  It's still being perfect.
[18383.86s -> 18385.30s]  But yeah, this is not just something you get
[18385.30s -> 18395.93s]  on an amusement park or at a mall.
[18395.93s -> 18398.72s]  They ship with dry ice.
[18398.72s -> 18407.35s]  Really?
[18407.35s -> 18408.19s]  They have a system.
[18408.19s -> 18411.02s]  You think they're amateurs or something?
[18411.02s -> 18412.66s]  I mean, you don't create ice cream like that
[18412.66s -> 18421.20s]  and not know kind of what's going on.
[18421.20s -> 18423.50s]  The Dippin' Dots CEO could run for president.
[18423.50s -> 18424.98s]  And I'd be like, all right.
[18424.98s -> 18426.81s]  All right, I think he understands.
[18426.81s -> 18434.10s]  I think he understands.
[18434.10s -> 18442.05s]  This guy can lead us or whoever they are.
[18442.05s -> 18444.89s]  Dippin' Dots C, weekly Dippin' Dots rant.
[18445.25s -> 18463.78s]  This is the first time I've ever spoke about this.
[18463.78s -> 18465.26s]  You're delusional, dude.
[18471.14s -> 18473.50s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18473.50s -> 18477.06s]  When you tell him to use the gumball machine?
[18477.06s -> 18487.87s]  Oh, fuck, I have to play.
[18487.87s -> 18489.11s]  The best thing about Dippin' Dots
[18489.11s -> 18492.74s]  was being at an amusement park, it was.
[18492.74s -> 18495.92s]  And you could just see the air coming off of it.
[18495.92s -> 18497.80s]  Whatever it was, CO2, nitrogen.
[18497.80s -> 18499.12s]  I don't even know what it is.
[18499.12s -> 18501.88s]  But when they take that shit out of the container,
[18501.88s -> 18503.64s]  they do the big scoop, big scoop,
[18503.64s -> 18504.48s]  and they hand it to you.
[18504.48s -> 18507.83s]  And this thing is smoking.
[18507.83s -> 18511.78s]  Ah, you can't replace that.
[18511.82s -> 18515.69s]  Join me for another amazing afternoon
[18515.69s -> 18521.03s]  called Grandpa Jeremy's Sweets and Treats.
[18521.03s -> 18523.19s]  This episode, we're gonna be talking about ice cream
[18523.19s -> 18524.43s]  and how delicious it is.
[18524.43s -> 18528.86s]  And when I was younger, different experiences I had.
[18528.86s -> 18530.78s]  One time I wanted.
[18530.78s -> 18535.03s]  Yeah, it's gonna happen eventually.
[18535.03s -> 18544.61s]  This is fun.
[18544.61s -> 18545.57s]  You got two orders.
[18545.57s -> 18565.95s]  I know, I'm going.
[18565.95s -> 18570.83s]  And make sure to get my cookbook.
[18570.83s -> 18573.48s]  Eggs and such.
[18573.48s -> 18576.06s]  It's four pages long.
[18576.06s -> 18577.62s]  It's my secret recipe for,
[18580.60s -> 18582.98s]  I don't fucking remember.
[18582.98s -> 18585.66s]  And then there's a big forward by me telling you
[18585.66s -> 18590.03s]  that they're really happy that you downloaded their book.
[18590.03s -> 18596.17s]  And then my favorite songs are on the last one.
[18596.17s -> 18603.80s]  Only two recipes in the book.
[18603.80s -> 18607.00s]  We're gonna try egg flavored Dippin' Dots today.
[18607.00s -> 18612.53s]  And they are fucking disgusting.
[18612.53s -> 18613.37s]  Oh no, I better be careful.
[18613.37s -> 18614.97s]  Then that channel turns into like,
[18614.97s -> 18617.57s]  like cinnamon challenges and stuff.
[18617.57s -> 18619.42s]  Uh oh.
[18619.42s -> 18622.98s]  Today on Food Sweet Treats with Grandpa.
[18622.98s -> 18630.02s]  I'm gonna eat the one chip hot fucking chip challenge today.
[18630.10s -> 18643.37s]  Oh, oh no.
[18643.37s -> 18645.09s]  Somebody said, bro, why are people tipping you
[18645.09s -> 18646.17s]  this much for ice cream?
[18646.17s -> 18648.01s]  I don't know, they're being like generous.
[18648.01s -> 18652.61s]  I don't know.
[18652.61s -> 18653.57s]  How much are they tipping?
[18653.57s -> 18662.77s]  It's like a few bucks, five bucks.
[18662.77s -> 18665.01s]  You're doing body language with the camera off, aren't you?
[18665.01s -> 18666.45s]  I mean, yeah, cause I'm talking
[18666.45s -> 18679.37s]  and people talk and they move their arms.
[18679.37s -> 18684.60s]  $13 tip, that's a pretty, that's a pretty good tip.
[18684.64s -> 18686.27s]  $13 bucks.
[18686.27s -> 18703.87s]  How much are you, what are we selling these for?
[18703.87s -> 18721.75s]  That guy loves ice cream.
[18721.75s -> 18725.30s]  Nice.
[18725.30s -> 18727.33s]  Have you played this for five hours?
[18727.33s -> 18729.47s]  This game's a classic.
[18729.47s -> 18732.31s]  And I don't know, we've just been talking,
[18732.31s -> 18733.31s]  chilling out, talking.
[18733.31s -> 18734.51s]  Well, I've been talking.
[18734.51s -> 18737.14s]  You've been listening.
[18737.14s -> 18739.74s]  Don't ever mistake that.
[18739.74s -> 18749.37s]  Don't ever mistake that.
[18749.37s -> 18750.21s]  Why did I do that?
[18750.21s -> 18767.76s]  I was like aiming over there.
[18767.76s -> 18789.13s]  There's way too much stuff in this restaurant.
[18789.13s -> 18792.26s]  All right, let's do one more night, one more day.
[18792.26s -> 18793.78s]  And then I'll probably call it there.
[18793.78s -> 18795.85s]  I wanna get some food.
[18795.85s -> 18809.06s]  Ooh, new topping.
[18809.06s -> 18810.34s]  I'll be back tomorrow, don't worry.
[18810.34s -> 18825.64s]  We're starting earlier tomorrow anyways.
[18825.64s -> 18833.25s]  It's good.
[18833.25s -> 18834.09s]  What are we doing tomorrow?
[18834.09s -> 18840.69s]  We are watching old 90s commercials.
[18840.69s -> 18844.57s]  And then on Sunday,
[18844.57s -> 18865.90s]  we're gonna play the House Flipper DLC, Farm DLC.
[18865.90s -> 18872.23s]  Very interested.
[18872.23s -> 18883.46s]  Yeah, we got some fun stuff to do.
[18883.46s -> 18901.93s]  Chocolate and cherry.
[18901.93s -> 18904.34s]  Can you see how tall the whipped cream can go?
[18904.34s -> 18907.68s]  Yeah, before I, I'll go and mess around in the other boat.
[18907.68s -> 18918.75s]  I have plenty more ingredients now.
[18918.75s -> 18919.83s]  This is, ready?
[18919.83s -> 18929.34s]  Oh, almost.
[18929.34s -> 18931.88s]  What is this stuff here?
[18931.88s -> 18948.43s]  Cherry sauce or something?
[18948.43s -> 18951.03s]  Blood.
[18951.51s -> 18955.00s]  There's a five-star customer now.
[18955.00s -> 18959.61s]  I've got at least three or four five-star customers.
[18959.61s -> 18960.65s]  Can you do a doy doy doy?
[18960.65s -> 18962.74s]  We've been good, yep.
[18962.74s -> 18965.92s]  Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.
[18965.92s -> 18967.12s]  I can't do it anymore.
[18967.12s -> 18969.12s]  Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.
[18969.12s -> 18986.12s]  I can do it a little bit.
[18986.12s -> 18997.48s]  I used to be disgusting at the doy doy doy.
[18997.48s -> 19000.47s]  Other people have tried to match me doing it,
[19000.47s -> 19022.30s]  but it's just, no one could even come close back in the day.
[19022.30s -> 19029.58s]  That's probably what I'm most known for.
[19029.58s -> 19031.82s]  Oh no, I'm definitely most known for burp puking
[19031.82s -> 19034.08s]  and swallowing it.
[19034.08s -> 19039.48s]  That was like my claim to fame from like five years ago.
[19039.48s -> 19054.49s]  Okay, this shit is not even right.
[19054.49s -> 19070.03s]  Oh, I remember when I got called out so bad.
[19070.03s -> 19073.11s]  There was a point a few years ago where somebody said,
[19073.11s -> 19075.27s]  hey dude, you know you keep doing the like,
[19075.27s -> 19076.87s]  I'm gonna puke and then swallow it thing?
[19076.87s -> 19078.79s]  And I was like, no way.
[19078.79s -> 19080.19s]  I've done it once.
[19080.19s -> 19081.99s]  And I think they came with receipts
[19081.99s -> 19083.75s]  and they were like five different times that I did it
[19083.75s -> 19087.43s]  over the course of like six months.
[19087.43s -> 19097.13s]  It was a thing that I did all the time, apparently.
[19097.17s -> 19111.30s]  Hey, I was pretty good at it.
[19111.30s -> 19127.64s]  Coconut, still another order.
[19127.64s -> 19144.85s]  I was mixed for way too long.
[19144.85s -> 19151.11s]  Hey, how often do you actually puke?
[19151.11s -> 19154.31s]  I haven't, I mean, this is kind of a gross conversation,
[19154.31s -> 19156.16s]  throw that away.
[19157.40s -> 19158.24s]  It's been a pretty long time.
[19158.24s -> 19170.66s]  I actually don't remember.
[19170.66s -> 19171.94s]  Well, that's not true.
[19171.94s -> 19175.48s]  I remember Holly and I went out one night
[19175.48s -> 19178.32s]  and we ate a bunch of pizza.
[19178.32s -> 19182.74s]  This is recent and we got an Uber home.
[19185.92s -> 19187.60s]  It was like, I feel like it was the way
[19187.60s -> 19188.64s]  that the pizza was settled
[19188.64s -> 19190.56s]  and the way the car was being driven.
[19190.56s -> 19191.80s]  And I was like, I don't feel good.
[19191.80s -> 19193.70s]  And I puked.
[19193.70s -> 19202.69s]  Yeah, no, that happened.
[19202.69s -> 19204.21s]  No, no, not in, no, no, no.
[19204.21s -> 19206.37s]  This is like well after like,
[19206.37s -> 19209.63s]  this is well after being out of the car.
[19209.63s -> 19214.37s]  Not in the car, no, well after,
[19214.37s -> 19226.19s]  at least I'd say at least 15 to 20 minutes later.
[19226.19s -> 19228.75s]  It was like the pizza just was sitting so strangely
[19228.75s -> 19232.64s]  and I don't know, something about being,
[19232.64s -> 19236.61s]  maybe I got like a little car sick or something.
[19236.61s -> 19240.19s]  Is that, that can happen to me sometimes
[19240.19s -> 19250.68s]  depending on where I am in the car.
[19250.68s -> 19252.72s]  No, I didn't puke in an Uber.
[19252.72s -> 19256.96s]  Guys, what are you talking about?
[19256.96s -> 19268.64s]  I puked like an hour later after being out of the car.
[19268.64s -> 19276.73s]  Before that, it was probably like 10 to 15 years.
[19276.73s -> 19281.92s]  Dude, what the, I'm not gonna let you tell me.
[19281.92s -> 19283.12s]  Didn't you say 20 minutes?
[19283.12s -> 19285.46s]  I don't know how fucking long it was.
[19285.46s -> 19292.14s]  It was at least 20 minutes.
[19292.14s -> 19293.34s]  Where are the customers?
[19293.46s -> 19298.11s]  Wait, hold on, whose order do I have?
[19298.11s -> 19301.99s]  Whose order is this?
[19301.99s -> 19307.37s]  There ain't nobody here.
[19307.37s -> 19308.97s]  Who am I making this for, me?
[19343.88s -> 19349.19s]  I gotta hurry this up, they've been gone.
[19349.19s -> 19351.79s]  No one wants to eat your moldy ice cream.
[19351.79s -> 19355.26s]  I don't know, I don't know how many times I've puked, okay?
[19355.26s -> 19358.17s]  Hey, probably a few in the last 10 years.
[19358.17s -> 19362.20s]  Maybe like three.
[19362.20s -> 19364.28s]  Hey, how about this, how many times have you puked?
[19364.28s -> 19366.63s]  What was the last time you puked, huh?
[19366.63s -> 19368.95s]  How many times have you puked in the last year?
[19368.95s -> 19372.82s]  Two years, five years.
[19372.86s -> 19376.49s]  I'm gonna flip it on you now.
[19376.49s -> 19377.85s]  Sometimes you just kind of feel like shit,
[19377.85s -> 19388.42s]  and sometimes you puke, whatever.
[19388.42s -> 19390.94s]  Hey, maybe every few years or something.
[19390.94s -> 19409.99s]  Something like that happens that often.
[19409.99s -> 19414.07s]  Couple of months ago I did, I ate a full pizza.
[19414.07s -> 19415.51s]  That's what I'm saying, I had like pizza
[19415.51s -> 19417.43s]  and it was like settling wrong with me.
[19417.43s -> 19434.95s]  Settled wrong.
[19434.95s -> 19442.85s]  Oh shit, well that's 75 points.
[19442.85s -> 19444.49s]  I actually like this comment a lot.
[19444.49s -> 19448.17s]  Imagine throwing up, wait, I gotta read it.
[19448.17s -> 19449.97s]  It was like about like being adult or something,
[19449.97s -> 19451.91s]  hold on, it was funny.
[19451.91s -> 19456.00s]  Where is it?
[19456.00s -> 19459.47s]  Where is it, it was funny.
[19459.47s -> 19470.03s]  Come on, I can't find it.
[19470.03s -> 19472.43s]  I don't know what the message was.
[19472.43s -> 19474.19s]  It was like, oh, imagine you throwing up,
[19474.19s -> 19476.32s]  like being an adult.
[19476.32s -> 19478.52s]  Yeah, imagine throwing up, you're an adult.
[19482.96s -> 19485.00s]  All right, if that's a true statement,
[19485.00s -> 19486.84s]  this is coming from somebody that's probably never had
[19486.84s -> 19488.64s]  one of those 24 hour bugs,
[19488.64s -> 19491.43s]  where you are puking and shitting every 15 minutes.
[19491.43s -> 19494.59s]  And I'm sorry, but I'm actually really happy
[19494.59s -> 19498.04s]  that you've never had to experience that before.
[19498.04s -> 19499.08s]  I'm actually really glad
[19499.08s -> 19500.48s]  that you've never had to deal with that.
[19500.48s -> 19501.92s]  That's actually great.
[19501.92s -> 19504.58s]  I hope you never have to.
[19504.58s -> 19510.63s]  I have had to deal with that before and it is not fun.
[19510.63s -> 19517.00s]  You're an adult, I love that.
[19517.00s -> 19518.96s]  I don't eat poisonous food.
[19523.21s -> 19524.97s]  You don't know what you, what?
[19524.97s -> 19535.60s]  It's not, they're jealous, dude.
[19535.60s -> 19538.16s]  I don't know if you'd be jealous of somebody throwing up
[19538.16s -> 19541.18s]  and like shitting their pants.
[19541.18s -> 19551.63s]  I didn't shit my pants.
[19551.63s -> 19552.75s]  All right, I'll see you guys later.
[19552.75s -> 19560.74s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[19560.74s -> 19562.90s]  So you shit your pants in an Uber.
[19562.94s -> 19571.40s]  You guys, I swear to God.
[19571.40s -> 19572.76s]  Imagine walking into a restaurant
[19572.76s -> 19574.56s]  and the cashier is just straight up rambling
[19574.56s -> 19576.04s]  about all the times he puked.
[19588.22s -> 19592.03s]  I'm gonna shit your pants.
[19592.03s -> 19592.87s]  All right, I feel like we should,
[19592.87s -> 19594.23s]  all right, I feel like you should time that person
[19594.23s -> 19597.73s]  out for five minutes.
[19597.73s -> 19599.57s]  Right, that's like five minutes, right?
[19599.57s -> 19609.07s]  I guess you should be timed up for two minutes.
[19609.07s -> 19612.19s]  You're gonna puke in your Uber.
[19612.19s -> 19620.35s]  Oh my God.
[19620.35s -> 19625.24s]  Hey, how about, don't be an asshole to Uber drivers.
[19625.24s -> 19638.84s]  They gotta deal with enough bullshit as it is.
[19638.88s -> 19640.60s]  Am I the asshole?
[19640.60s -> 19647.81s]  Am I the asshole?
[19647.81s -> 19651.08s]  Please don't shit in my pants.
[19651.08s -> 19663.24s]  All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[19663.24s -> 19664.08s]  This is fun.
[19664.08s -> 19664.92s]  I like this.
[19664.92s -> 19667.24s]  This is a good time.
[19667.24s -> 19670.89s]  I'm gonna watch some ads tomorrow.
[19670.89s -> 19672.93s]  That's the plan.
[19672.93s -> 19675.93s]  Starting somewhere around 4 p.m. Pacific,
[19675.93s -> 19681.93s]  a couple hours earlier.
[19681.93s -> 19685.15s]  Tomorrow, probably not gonna be a long one tomorrow.
[19685.15s -> 19686.80s]  Maybe a few hours.
[19686.80s -> 19687.96s]  I feel like there's only a certain amount
[19687.96s -> 19692.92s]  of those videos that we can handle.
[19692.92s -> 19696.20s]  But Sunday we will do a big meaty one
[19696.20s -> 19703.80s]  because of House Flipper.
[19704.00s -> 19706.23s]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[19706.23s -> 19710.35s]  Take care of yourselves.
[19710.35s -> 19714.66s]  Club Penguin Sound Effects has been going for two hours
[19714.66s -> 19719.12s]  and I'm not even upset about it.
[19719.12s -> 19720.40s]  Is this saved?
[19720.40s -> 19726.09s]  I think so, right?
[19726.09s -> 19728.84s]  Yep.
[19728.84s -> 19731.47s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[19731.47s -> 19732.57s]  See you tomorrow.
[19732.57s -> 19734.49s]  If you're gonna show up tomorrow,
[19734.49s -> 19737.77s]  I would highly suggest you do if you have time.
[19737.77s -> 19740.09s]  I feel like tomorrow will be a really fun stream.
[19740.09s -> 19749.75s]  Those ad streams are really actually some of my favorites.
[19749.75s -> 19750.59s]  What time tomorrow?
[19750.59s -> 19758.03s]  4 p.m. Pacific is when I'm gonna start.
[19758.03s -> 19766.37s]  We'll get some decent compilations going.
[19766.37s -> 19772.36s]  See you soon.
[19772.36s -> 19775.17s]  Can you do a sober stream tomorrow?
[19776.60s -> 19791.41s]  Yes.
[19791.41s -> 19792.94s]  But yeah, take care.
[19792.94s -> 19795.04s]  Call your mother.
[19795.04s -> 19795.88s]  Have a great evening.
[19795.88s -> 19799.17s]  It's really late for a lot of you.
[19799.17s -> 19803.31s]  Late night, Andy.
[19803.31s -> 19808.23s]  See you soon.
[19808.23s -> 19863.96s]  Ta ta.
