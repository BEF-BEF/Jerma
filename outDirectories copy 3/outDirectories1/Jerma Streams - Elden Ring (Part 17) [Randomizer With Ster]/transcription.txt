[1.08s -> 12.04s]  Okay, okay, all right. Did you tweet? I'm about to. Okay, I'm waiting for the retweet potential. It's right there?
[12.16s -> 25.13s]  It's very it's very boring. It's just a basic boring tweet. Yeah, but like I I would have to write my own. All right, so
[25.53s -> 27.21s]  Hey
[27.21s -> 30.41s]  What's up, everybody? How's everybody doing?
[32.12s -> 44.30s]  Welcome to Elden Ring Co-op. Which one of us will become the Elden Lord? Only one of us can. All right
[45.45s -> 52.81s]  Uh, I got everything going. Let's open this up. All right. Are we good? I think we're good
[53.21s -> 59.05s]  All right. So we here are two. I know there's no intro. I know I know I get we were so late
[59.53s -> 64.10s]  I just do that. Well, you need a little bit of intro. All right. Here's a little bit of an intro for you
[64.10s -> 68.10s]  There might be some people that you know, check the bars like I don't even know what this is. What are they doing?
[69.19s -> 75.38s]  Right. Okay. So we have installed your mic is weird. Oh
[76.10s -> 82.15s]  No, it's not one guy. I mean my mic is weird. Who said that?
[83.37s -> 88.50s]  Oh, it's a one. Okay. Why how is it possible that I could read that? All right
[88.50s -> 92.78s]  Anyways, so we have installed right now. We have the seamless co-op mod
[93.18s -> 100.33s]  Which means that we can both be in the game. We don't have to do any signs or soap stone things
[100.41s -> 102.41s]  We're just in the game together permanently
[102.65s -> 107.83s]  We also have randomizer on all the randomized enemies that we don't know what they are
[107.83s -> 111.19s]  We have no idea nice McDonald's voice time that person over a day
[111.27s -> 116.87s]  All of all of the items are randomized and all of the monsters are randomized and I believe even between us
[116.95s -> 119.11s]  We might have different random seeds for items
[119.11s -> 121.35s]  So what you pick up is going to be different than what I pick up
[121.67s -> 126.15s]  And the way the randomizer worked from the last time I used it is like every time you pick up like the basic
[126.31s -> 129.91s]  Roa berry, uh, that item is always a different item
[130.07s -> 133.83s]  It's not a different item every time you pick one of them up like a roa berry could be
[134.47s -> 140.87s]  Sledgehammer really you'll just constantly be picking up sledgehammer. Yeah. Yeah, I'm me strong by the way
[140.95s -> 144.39s]  This is me strong. I told you I promised a me strong playthrough and this is what it is
[144.79s -> 153.91s]  Uh, this is me smart inspired by blanca. If I roll you guys make lightning you do. Oh, all right
[153.91s -> 158.81s]  You guys ready? Are we wait make sure everyone is everybody here. Are you present?
[159.29s -> 163.93s]  There's a couple people missing stirs is it stir is quiet. Hold on. I'll fix it. I'll fix it stir
[163.93s -> 167.64s]  You're a little quiet. Let me turn you up. Okay. I'll talk a little louder
[167.80s -> 171.26s]  You don't have to do it. I got you say can you say you're like your abc's real quick?
[171.90s -> 173.90s]  a b c d e f g
[174.22s -> 176.22s]  h i j k l m n o p
[176.38s -> 179.98s]  I have a friend who can't recite the criken can't recite the alphabet
[181.21s -> 186.46s]  Did you get louder like how are you not louder for me right now? Um, I don't know. This is very bizarre
[189.13s -> 193.67s]  I'm turning you up in discord, but you're not being turned up at all to me. Uh
[195.03s -> 198.28s]  Pump up the volume pump it up pump up the volume
[198.52s -> 202.82s]  Okay, I turned you up as high as I could possibly turn you up. I think it's you you think it's me
[203.30s -> 206.34s]  All right, is that is that better because I don't know what's going on with what's wrong with it
[206.58s -> 214.38s]  Say your abc's one more time a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
[214.70s -> 226.06s]  I don't know what's wrong with you. What's wrong with me if I mess up like better. All right. All right, let's go. Okay
[229.85s -> 232.02s]  My apologies will come later. Oh, that's right
[232.02s -> 234.42s]  You have to go and look at a full apology like dude
[234.42s -> 238.74s]  Do you want to fight the boss or do you want to like I need like full attention to explain the like 10 step
[238.82s -> 242.34s]  Program of how i've ruined your day and like how we're never gonna talk again
[242.98s -> 244.41s]  No, all right
[244.41s -> 252.89s]  Let's let's fight dracula and then we'll talk about it. All right elden ring co-op with randomizers
[253.19s -> 257.43s]  I hope you remember the buttons because we kept drinking elixirs every time we went to go open a door
[259.22s -> 266.74s]  I remember hey, can we be the tutorial? No, you think we can be the tutorial boss. He's taking like no damage
[267.86s -> 280.10s]  Get good first person to die here. Um has to I don't know something funny
[282.89s -> 284.89s]  All right, you're gonna better queue up something funny
[285.69s -> 290.33s]  Get a first person to die something funny they have to do. Oh you have to do something funny
[290.81s -> 295.85s]  I've never been funny ever
[296.73s -> 298.73s]  You're supposed to be high right now
[301.48s -> 305.77s]  You don't know anything
[305.77s -> 307.21s]  I'm kidding. I'm
[307.21s -> 312.78s]  Don't please wait. Is that why you like you left the room before we started you go do like edibles?
[313.18s -> 327.34s]  No weird. No, are you like a delinquent streamer now? Are you like no hell what happened? I'm so concerned
[327.58s -> 333.50s]  What happens fond in the tutorial instantly died and now i'm watching your character with no health float
[334.78s -> 337.02s]  Just float just not moving float
[338.71s -> 344.26s]  Because i'm at a loading screen. Oh, yeah
[346.02s -> 351.54s]  All right. All right. So here's what we're gonna do. Uh, we're just gonna I mean
[352.36s -> 356.36s]  Maybe this is why they wait. No, no, no, this is normal. This is normal. This happens. This is normal
[356.76s -> 363.53s]  We this is this is fine. We just have to read just restart. This is fine. I'm i'm you're gonna touch a shrine or
[364.01s -> 366.01s]  I'm I think we have to restart
[366.25s -> 370.01s]  No, go through the tutorial and rest at one of the bonfires. Yes. Okay. All right. All right. All right
[370.09s -> 376.36s]  We'll just just let everybody just chill out. We're good. Well, everyone just chill up chill out. Everything's fine
[378.68s -> 382.68s]  All right, we're just gonna exit. Okay. Yeah, there is always league of legends to
[383.88s -> 388.12s]  If this doesn't work, i'm not playing league of legends. Okay. All right. So just open the game up
[388.12s -> 390.28s]  That's not there's no problems at all. Like there's not a problem
[390.28s -> 394.74s]  Just the more that we focus on the negativity the more that it's going to cause a problem
[394.74s -> 399.40s]  So just open it back up get to a spot before you're closing the game
[399.96s -> 405.78s]  I I was stuck. Oh, i'm stuck too. Yeah, just I would just restart it get out to that first bonfire
[406.26s -> 409.94s]  The one with um, you know when you see like the big open area just relax
[410.02s -> 415.14s]  Yeah, I I had been told that you you had to get to the first bonfire and now I see why
[415.54s -> 419.58s]  Okay. All right. Just that's all right
[422.02s -> 423.80s]  Okay
[423.80s -> 429.19s]  Everything is good to go. I'm just opening it again. Relax. I know a lot of people are like oh my god
[429.19s -> 436.65s]  Not like this. Everything's everything's going exactly that is not like this right that all that's all over we've all
[437.85s -> 438.17s]  Okay
[438.17s -> 442.89s]  so originally we were going to start when my food got here and I finished eating because we didn't want to get interrupted right and
[442.89s -> 448.55s]  Then my my food delivery man texted me saying hold on. I need to restart my car
[449.51s -> 453.99s]  Uh, because I because he was parked at the food place for like an hour
[457.78s -> 463.62s]  So that that was that's part one of why it was definitely my fault. My food was about an hour and 15 minutes late
[464.12s -> 469.98s]  Okay, and then also I tried to make everything easier for jerma and like tried to set some of this stuff up yesterday
[470.36s -> 472.52s]  And like I I was a little confused
[472.52s -> 474.52s]  I was like i'm gonna send you these files
[474.76s -> 478.52s]  And like everything that I did and everything I told him to do was wrong until at the very end
[478.52s -> 481.80s]  We were just like fine. Let's do it like just go through the steps
[481.88s -> 487.54s]  Just follow these steps and then everything worked but I I tried like three different ways
[488.02s -> 490.78s]  To give him
[490.86s -> 493.98s]  You were trying you were trying to make it so easy
[494.68s -> 501.02s]  Yeah, so easy and it ended up being so difficult. I made everything significantly harder
[501.10s -> 503.40s]  Okay
[503.40s -> 506.22s]  So I think i'm ready
[506.54s -> 513.27s]  I think i'm ready to you at that first like the one before you open the door before the the first bonfire that you can
[513.27s -> 522.55s]  Actually touch right? Yeah, um in the basement at the bonfire with the knife. I'm gonna turn you up a little bit more
[524.36s -> 527.40s]  Because it's people are saying you're still a little quiet
[528.52s -> 535.11s]  I can turn myself up a bit as well. Does that help talk say some stuff a b c d e f g h i j k elemental p
[536.79s -> 543.34s]  Is that better? We're good to go. All right. Is that good? Way better. Perfect. All right. Cool. All right. All right
[544.14s -> 546.44s]  Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah
[548.94s -> 557.48s]  All right, i'm coming in. Are you ready? I'm ready. I hope so you're at that first site of grace. I am turning this on
[558.39s -> 567.08s]  I'm I'm at the first site of grace. Yes. Oh, you can't see i'll turn it on. I'm
[568.04s -> 571.32s]  I can't contain it. I'm so excited. What the fuck was that noise? What?
[572.04s -> 574.92s]  It sounded like someone did a drive-by on you
[575.80s -> 578.76s]  What like I thought I just heard like a machine gun firing
[583.27s -> 585.61s]  No
[585.61s -> 591.27s]  All right. I'm that sounds like a bird in your room. Can you pick up this item? There's an item here
[591.67s -> 595.22s]  What is it? So is something weird? Oh dude
[596.26s -> 599.34s]  Why did I get so much stuff?
[599.42s -> 602.78s]  Sacred relic sword ash of wood. Did you get all these things?
[603.34s -> 609.66s]  I got I got a ripple blade and a smithing stone dude. I got all right
[609.66s -> 614.81s]  Our items are not the same by the way, but I got a lot of cool stuff. I can't even use it
[615.21s -> 618.60s]  Yeah, I can't equip it because we're
[621.46s -> 628.10s]  Well, whatever we have randomized loot does that cares? Yeah, it's gonna be a rough start before we can you know
[628.50s -> 634.01s]  Get something we can actually use that's an end game weapon. That's an end game boss weapon
[634.09s -> 639.93s]  Yeah, all right. The the big kicker is is this thing out here the same for both of us, right?
[641.00s -> 647.16s]  Well, the tutorial guy was already the same. So I think that's settled. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come back here
[648.87s -> 650.86s]  Okay, let's do a bit. No, no, no
[650.86s -> 654.22s]  I'm just saying like it's been a while since I played this remember the first time you opened this door
[654.46s -> 659.42s]  You went like this. Did you do this? I did I was like, holy shit
[660.76s -> 663.08s]  You know what? I the first thing I did is I walked out here
[663.08s -> 668.28s]  I saw the night and I said wow i've seen I haven't seen anything in this game other than a whole bunch of streamers
[668.28s -> 671.08s]  Waste their time fighting this for three hours at the start of their streams
[671.16s -> 673.72s]  I'm not gonna bore you guys with that and i'm gonna walk by it
[674.12s -> 675.40s]  That's what I did
[675.40s -> 680.36s]  David you're the type of player that like opens the wikipedia page the second you install. I don't I didn't no
[680.44s -> 685.16s]  I just that was the only thing I knew is that I didn't want to fight that enemy for like two hours
[685.48s -> 688.84s]  There's always one dark souls enemy in the beginning that it was like oh I can beat it
[689.00s -> 693.00s]  And then they can't fucking beat it and they can't own up to that. They you didn't beat it, right?
[693.08s -> 698.39s]  How long did you fight it? Who is this by the way? Is this still the same character? Uh,
[699.56s -> 707.02s]  Yes, but I think they're what they're wearing is randomized. So they look different. Okay. Did you touch this touch it?
[707.18s -> 709.75s]  Let's take a let's take a little nap
[709.75s -> 714.25s]  All right. So by the way, keep in mind if either one of us sits at a bonfire it resets the whole game
[714.81s -> 721.69s]  So we have to be we have to okay. What's that? That's uh tree spirit, right? Yeah. Okay. So
[722.25s -> 724.92s]  All right. What do you want to do?
[724.92s -> 725.72s]  um
[725.72s -> 732.02s]  Well, I I think I mean I know exactly what we should do but I want to leave it to you
[732.18s -> 739.48s]  So we don't have another terraria moment. I mean the I don't think there is a terraria moment. What's what do you what's this?
[740.70s -> 746.58s]  Ooh, what's it? Oh, that's not that's normal. Yeah. No, that was different for me. I mean we we have to go get the horse, right?
[746.58s -> 754.22s]  Oh something was different. Yeah, so okay the first thing you do you got to run up to the church and rest there
[754.86s -> 757.58s]  Yes, and then you run to the other bonfire and then you get the horse
[759.43s -> 764.60s]  But like I don't I see it like I already feel like i'm dragging you. No, no, no, that's what I would have done
[765.74s -> 770.54s]  Okay, well I need you to say what you're gonna do and then like I want to be like you're the strong one
[770.94s -> 774.30s]  And I trust you so you should do magic then you should be like a magic user
[774.30s -> 780.66s]  I should be like the two-handed weapon user. Yeah, like ideally if I if I can find magic also, uh
[781.22s -> 787.85s]  Everything the merchant sells should also be randomized really. Oh a golden rune. Oh
[790.10s -> 795.54s]  Yeah, finding what's up, uh, like hero runes that you can pop in the early game are pretty funny. Look at that
[796.02s -> 806.31s]  I have a I have a tunic. Damn it. Okay. What do you got? Yeah, this is
[807.35s -> 817.54s]  Shit kindred of wrought ashes. I don't even know what the hell I want to do
[818.10s -> 821.54s]  Yeah, and one of the settings that I had enabled should exist. Um
[822.26s -> 826.58s]  The notes that they sell I think are hints to key items in case we can't find one
[826.58s -> 828.34s]  You can buy the notes from them and they'll be like, hey
[828.42s -> 838.06s]  Did you know that like the great rune is actually here take the giant's flame? I wouldn't screw up your game
[839.83s -> 846.50s]  What where oh you rest it the npc disappeared when you rushed it I was like, oh no
[847.06s -> 850.26s]  I'm super paranoid that like something else. I know but whatever
[851.14s -> 854.34s]  Look, it's it's a bunch of fucking mods. It's there's gonna be problems, right?
[854.50s -> 855.14s]  Okay
[855.14s -> 859.62s]  Well, then we gotta go up the road to the next bonfire so we can get our horse and also
[861.78s -> 864.90s]  Pick up any items we find so it's every single enemy is randomized
[864.90s -> 871.10s]  So that means that the random kind of tarnished that are walking around could just be like millennia. I believe so. Yeah
[871.93s -> 876.81s]  And they should be scary if they're if it is a boss, it's scaled down. This is still just a goat
[876.89s -> 896.50s]  This is the stuff. Wait, there's a hand they are scaled. All right, that's funny great dragonfly head. It's stupid
[898.90s -> 899.22s]  All right
[899.22s -> 902.74s]  I think the goats and stuff might not be randomized because they need to be
[904.14s -> 910.02s]  I don't know. I just all the animals aren't they're like not enemies. I don't know put it on
[910.34s -> 919.88s]  I don't think i've ever even seen that enemy in the game
[920.44s -> 927.74s]  All right, so we need to go wait. I can't open my map
[929.74s -> 935.58s]  Uh, because there's enemies targeting us that that flower is trying to kill us. Are you serious? All right. Well, it's scaled, right?
[936.54s -> 941.85s]  Yeah, they still take a million hits
[948.38s -> 953.58s]  I forgot I forgot. It's all right. Well, we'll we'll get there just stand on the poison. It doesn't matter. Just kill it
[969.40s -> 973.24s]  Are you dead? I thought it killed you in one hit. That scream made me think I was dead
[974.65s -> 976.65s]  Oh stagga stagga
[978.33s -> 980.33s]  I didn't know you could stagger the plants
[981.99s -> 985.62s]  Jesus christ
[985.62s -> 990.09s]  Okay, so what do we get for that?
[990.09s -> 996.81s]  Slumbering egg and an octopus. Oh free. I got trash. Let's get the bonfire in here
[997.21s -> 1003.67s]  Oh, yeah, so we can be unpoisoned and we'll go the other way. Do you think we'll beat the first boss?
[1005.43s -> 1007.43s]  Uh, I mean the first boss
[1007.75s -> 1010.76s]  Could just be like a bandit. That's very true
[1013.27s -> 1019.67s]  Why are you still poisoned? Uh, i'm not you look you to me. You look like you're poisoned as well
[1020.47s -> 1023.19s]  Okay, let's just run we gotta get we gotta go get our dog
[1026.68s -> 1035.16s]  Somebody said we might have to restart the game one more time after this cutscene. Okay, somebody said stinky
[1035.16s -> 1037.16s]  Yeah, you just have like the sims
[1037.56s -> 1047.06s]  Uh, like hygiene is zero right now. Well, it's kind of what it's like. All right, let's see what happens
[1056.09s -> 1062.26s]  Hmm. Are you just gonna skip this? Yeah, I skipped it. You're sitting on the ground stinking for me
[1065.37s -> 1067.37s]  Okay, I'm I'm talking
[1070.76s -> 1074.22s]  except
[1074.46s -> 1078.30s]  Oh, I didn't even I didn't even get to talk to her. Oh you didn't no
[1080.06s -> 1083.18s]  You see me walking around? Yeah, you're just kind of walking around. All right. What happens if you sit down?
[1085.64s -> 1088.68s]  I mean I did I got the cutscene, but I didn't get to talk to her afterwards
[1089.24s -> 1091.40s]  Oh, there is the talk to millennia option
[1092.12s -> 1094.76s]  I'd like to an auto trigger. How do we make it so we don't smell?
[1096.04s -> 1110.31s]  I kind of like the stink. I kind of feel at home. Okay
[1112.89s -> 1120.68s]  I don't want to look at that the whole time. We play I bet you if you die, it'll be gone, baby
[1120.92s -> 1125.32s]  I mean you're stinking for me, but i'm okay with that. I don't mind it's not a big deal
[1125.40s -> 1133.05s]  How do I how do I get to that? There it is. No, don't do that. I wonder okay
[1138.90s -> 1144.92s]  All right commander. What do we do now? All right now open world. We can go anywhere get on your horse
[1145.16s -> 1153.56s]  I forgot how to do that too. I gotta equip it. All right, so we need to like level up
[1154.97s -> 1158.01s]  Let's clear out and we need to find some items. How wait, how do you?
[1158.97s -> 1165.45s]  Jesus how do you bookmark? Okay, so hit start just the regular start menu you go use your d-pad to go all the way to the right
[1166.18s -> 1168.26s]  This is where I put it is over in that pouch menu
[1168.26s -> 1172.90s]  You hit y to switch and then you hold y to get to that sub menu. That's how I do it
[1184.52s -> 1191.69s]  I'm remembering that's the last see I've uh, yeah, we've all played this game, but it was like three years ago
[1192.49s -> 1201.45s]  Let's feel like a while doesn't it? All right. So what's in the box for you? Oh, you don't stink anymore. Oh good
[1202.44s -> 1210.46s]  God's skin peeler got a perfume bottle. Do all this shit just takes I don't that thing's not bad, isn't it?
[1212.68s -> 1214.86s]  That thing's like really good
[1214.94s -> 1217.50s]  I need 17 strength and 22 dexterity
[1217.74s -> 1221.02s]  Oh, we need to establish a rule right now because we're finding different items
[1221.18s -> 1223.26s]  Are we allowed to drop items for the other person?
[1224.47s -> 1228.87s]  Like if I find a two-hander and you're like, oh dude, I want that right. Uh, what do you guys think?
[1229.96s -> 1233.10s]  I would say no unless a lot of essential
[1234.46s -> 1238.94s]  Uh, let's get a pull up. I think because i'm seeing if it's very it's very mixed. It's no. Yes. No, no
[1238.94s -> 1240.78s]  No, yes. Yes. Yes. I don't know. No. No. No. Yeah. Yeah
[1240.78s -> 1253.94s]  In the meantime found items. All right, let's click we have a problem. This person has a bunch of runes
[1254.18s -> 1260.25s]  I thought they're supposed to scale. I thought the enemy's scaled. I mean they do but
[1261.30s -> 1278.22s]  What why is it so much health? What's the ash of war with this thing? Our weapons just suck like i'm on a dagger
[1278.62s -> 1282.33s]  That's true. I'm gonna die
[1282.49s -> 1286.68s]  You know
[1286.68s -> 1289.00s]  Well, I can't believe that I can't believe we're already fighting the first boss
[1289.48s -> 1291.96s]  I mean this this sort of is if you think about it
[1292.60s -> 1299.80s]  It really is
[1299.80s -> 1301.48s]  He's just so fast
[1301.48s -> 1311.98s]  All right. What do you actually want to play as because we need to figure this out. I gotta find something. I I wouldn't play magic
[1311.98s -> 1315.77s]  Skip it around
[1315.77s -> 1318.89s]  This looks so weird. You're kind of like boarding around a little. All right
[1319.61s -> 1323.30s]  We got it
[1323.30s -> 1324.78s]  Ooh
[1324.78s -> 1339.48s]  They didn't drop anything me strong the priest. I feel like you're just you're getting things
[1339.80s -> 1341.88s]  Yeah, my game's really fun. Yours doesn't sound very fun
[1342.60s -> 1350.86s]  My i've started on not fun mode. I have enough to level up. We should probably do that
[1351.34s -> 1353.42s]  Well, you're gonna respawn that fucking boss enemy
[1355.42s -> 1358.46s]  Yeah, but I mean we need to level up. We're let's clear. Let's clear this area
[1358.62s -> 1363.58s]  I think I actually have the stone shard starting item to open up the door and we can try and get random items
[1363.58s -> 1371.43s]  I think this map item is also probably random. Oh, this is okay. I'm gonna pick up this map item
[1372.23s -> 1374.39s]  Okay, it is a map. All right, I got it
[1375.11s -> 1377.48s]  You dead? Oh it dead
[1377.72s -> 1383.67s]  Uh, wait, one of the god skin bosses is right here. So, uh, I don't know what what we need to do
[1384.55s -> 1389.21s]  Should we run or should we fight it? I am still naked with a dagger
[1390.17s -> 1393.53s]  But but I I can take it. I am a cleric
[1394.49s -> 1408.87s]  I have no flasks. I'm the smartest caveman. All right, i'm going back and sitting at the bonfire. Are you coming? Sure
[1409.19s -> 1415.54s]  This is aggroed onto us right now. Well, then do it what happened to you?
[1416.71s -> 1420.49s]  Nothing happened to me, but everything reset. All right. What do we this is important?
[1421.13s -> 1424.84s]  Give him your armor. Well, he has to ask nicely for it. It was the pole
[1425.62s -> 1429.30s]  Uh, overwhelmingly. Yes to share items. Yeah
[1431.37s -> 1445.54s]  That honestly surprises me. I mean I think I have to do strength to make this bearable
[1445.62s -> 1449.80s]  Well, I mean we can also just drop like end game boss weapons
[1451.46s -> 1455.14s]  Okay, do you yeah, do you want your gear here? How do I how do you drop something here? Now follow me?
[1455.30s -> 1460.02s]  Okay, this is my i'm my one directive. Okay, this is just following me. I'm gonna follow on your horse
[1460.42s -> 1471.11s]  Let's go. We ride watch out for the jelly, you know, all the like, uh,
[1471.91s -> 1477.83s]  The graves. Yeah that have a whole bunch of pickable like runes that are like there's like 10 runes on a whole bunch of
[1478.07s -> 1481.99s]  Well market great. We need to market. We gotta play. I'm not I kind of remember how to get there
[1481.99s -> 1489.86s]  But I don't remember where it is on the map. You sound like a dad like oh, yeah. I know I know where it is
[1490.34s -> 1494.58s]  Do you yeah, of course I do. I don't know where it is. But I know like the general here
[1494.58s -> 1498.20s]  I don't want a map. Hey, watch out for this giant rolling ball. You don't want to get you don't
[1498.36s -> 1502.95s]  Get squished by the ball
[1502.95s -> 1507.43s]  I think we should look at the map who needs a map. I don't want him. I I don't know how to look at the
[1508.63s -> 1509.91s]  Watch this
[1509.91s -> 1521.06s]  I do
[1521.06s -> 1524.02s]  I mean i'm in combat. I know you know what they look like on the map. They're like the little
[1524.80s -> 1533.32s]  Rectangles, I mean i'm pretty sure I know where i'm going
[1538.74s -> 1541.96s]  Do you?

[1573.46s -> 1580.23s]  All right. I'm still falling. You seem to know where you're going. I'm lost
[1580.71s -> 1583.75s]  You really are aren't you tell me the truth. No, it's no it's this way
[1585.48s -> 1586.92s]  Tell me the truth
[1586.92s -> 1590.36s]  I'm not lost if I were lost i'd say so because I wouldn't want to like
[1592.06s -> 1595.58s]  Derail any further than I have today. No, okay. You're right. You got it
[1598.44s -> 1601.80s]  No, you had it right. Yeah right here right here. So let's uh, just loot loot up

[1641.96s -> 1651.35s]  Tonic of forgetfulness. Yeah, I didn't I got the anchor if you want it remembrance of the dragon lord. Wait, hold on
[1653.85s -> 1657.53s]  This is oh, this is the remembrance
[1657.69s -> 1659.38s]  Oh
[1659.38s -> 1662.66s]  That's a lot of souls dude, i'm gonna be like level 50 right now
[1662.74s -> 1670.82s]  We're gonna stomp through this game. Do you want did you get any actual armor?
[1671.14s -> 1677.53s]  I don't even know what this item is either actually. Uh, no, I still have no armor. How do I drop something?
[1679.64s -> 1687.38s]  I man, you know, I the poll said yes, but my my heart is still saying no your heart says no, okay. Yeah
[1688.74s -> 1691.30s]  I thought I was naked. I thought this dick was right there
[1692.41s -> 1696.57s]  I was like, oh my god. Oh god. Don't look don't look. Oh, that reminds me of a story
[1696.65s -> 1698.41s]  I was uh, I was getting the mods yesterday
[1698.41s -> 1700.49s]  So I was looking through the elden ring mod nexus
[1701.13s -> 1704.25s]  And I was just scrolling down to see other popular mods if there's anything else we could do
[1704.33s -> 1707.99s]  Oh, no, and then one came up and I was like, that's weird
[1709.22s -> 1715.30s]  Better nude model what objectively makes a nude model better than the other nude model and I clicked to open it
[1715.54s -> 1718.42s]  And then my wife walked in the room behind me and was like, what is that?
[1719.94s -> 1728.58s]  Somebody said don't scroll on nexus mods. Yeah, seriously popular mods you scroll down once and it's like
[1729.22s -> 1730.74s]  Do you want the naked?
[1730.74s -> 1734.02s]  Um doll the purple blue doll girl
[1734.42s -> 1737.78s]  Oh, we can also do that because it's night time if we go back to that bonfire
[1737.78s -> 1740.02s]  I forget how that works. You like rested it and she's like, oh
[1741.02s -> 1745.02s]  Oh, and you need that for the spirit things, but I imagine we're not summoning because we're already two people
[1745.02s -> 1747.66s]  All right. We've gone. Let's let's teleport back to
[1749.45s -> 1752.89s]  that church church of
[1753.45s -> 1759.93s]  Ella, right because then we'll probably get the cutscene we can i'm gonna love love like 30 times
[1761.08s -> 1771.43s]  Oh, it's a vote to warp. Oh, yeah, she was totally nude
[1772.46s -> 1780.23s]  But also she's a doll. It doesn't make sense warping takes forever for the non-host by the way. Okay, that's all right
[1781.22s -> 1789.37s]  Yeah, i'm already talking to her don't forget your helmet
[1791.27s -> 1794.15s]  I think she'll also give you a random item. She gave me a fire of blossoms
[1800.95s -> 1806.46s]  Now it is thine to do as thou wishest. All right. I have the spirit calling bell and a death root
[1806.95s -> 1811.98s]  I she's not even here, but I don't think it really matters. All right. I'm gonna level up like 15 to 30 times
[1814.42s -> 1819.91s]  Okay, i'm going to get one level. I can't level level three

[2053.15s -> 2054.91s]  Hands off. What the fuck?
[2054.91s -> 2059.29s]  We don't have a lantern by the way. Yeah, I know

[2096.68s -> 2100.92s]  All right. Oh, it's actually this actually is actually really bad
[2101.48s -> 2111.31s]  Is that uh, it's actually kind of an inappropriate room
[2114.84s -> 2122.88s]  I gotta remember how this how this fight works. I hope you deal damage because I don't
[2123.52s -> 2143.92s]  You're doing fine. All right, back it up back it up ugly. Look at me. I tried to pull it didn't work
[2160.70s -> 2166.57s]  I don't think we're gonna do this
[2166.57s -> 2171.37s]  I he one shot me he dead. It looked like he was attacking you and he spun all the way around
[2172.48s -> 2174.48s]  All right, are you spectating me?
[2175.02s -> 2177.52s]  Yeah, you got this dude. You're unbeatable
[2178.48s -> 2197.01s]  I've heard you're unbeatable find out what I dodged it
[2201.22s -> 2212.53s]  I feel like you're you're actually doing less damage than I was I am because you haven't gotten a weapon
[2230.69s -> 2231.65s]  Oh
[2231.65s -> 2233.65s]  Fuck fuck
[2233.73s -> 2236.67s]  Fuck
[2236.67s -> 2239.55s]  I thought he was me strong, but he was me weak
[2242.62s -> 2250.08s]  Okay, so what's happening? My somebody said I fucked up the whole my whole character. Do you think we can do it?
[2250.16s -> 2252.66s]  I think we can do it
[2252.66s -> 2259.86s]  Uh, it's it's doable. It's a little rough for me because I i'm level three and I have no vigor or armor
[2262.86s -> 2264.86s]  Let's go we can do it. Okay
[2265.70s -> 2267.30s]  One more try one more try
[2267.30s -> 2276.80s]  Let's just run downstairs because these items are gonna be the same. Oh, that's right
[2277.60s -> 2281.58s]  Well, actually if we kill if we kill people they might be different, right?
[2283.49s -> 2287.86s]  All right, this idiot is over here. I'm just going down. Yes, technically if they drop different stuff
[2288.42s -> 2290.93s]  All right, i'm going in
[2290.93s -> 2292.93s]  What technicality? Okay, i'm coming
[2293.41s -> 2300.38s]  You doomed him by over leveling oh because the creature is scaling to you wait why
[2301.18s -> 2306.62s]  Because because the random enemies do scale. I don't know. I don't know your chat. I think they might just be saying words
[2307.42s -> 2309.86s]  I don't think your character's bricked
[2309.94s -> 2311.06s]  um
[2311.06s -> 2314.02s]  I think you're doing great. Okay. Well just you've
[2315.36s -> 2318.34s]  Let's go
[2318.34s -> 2320.22s]  Hey guys
[2320.22s -> 2322.30s]  Let's game. Yes. That's what i'm saying
[2327.66s -> 2329.34s]  Being extra careful
[2329.34s -> 2335.60s]  Because he might just fucking 180 degree spin and aggro at me
[2337.06s -> 2341.34s]  I'm cutting off his tail, dude
[2341.34s -> 2343.86s]  Oh
[2343.86s -> 2348.06s]  Oh shit
[2348.06s -> 2350.06s]  Oh, come on really doing a row. Yeah
[2352.21s -> 2355.49s]  Yo, he he's just spamming that move. He's new with this
[2356.37s -> 2365.97s]  He's just spamming
[2365.97s -> 2367.41s]  Uh-oh
[2367.41s -> 2371.41s]  Like that lingering hitbox cheater cheater spammer
[2372.29s -> 2379.39s]  Are you gonna do the crawl again?
[2379.39s -> 2384.99s]  Don't get too greedy you just got so greedy and it's making me I try I know I've mistimed my dodge. I'm sorry
[2387.25s -> 2390.80s]  What what did he swing at?
[2390.80s -> 2393.12s]  I don't know. The room is very small for this character
[2396.83s -> 2398.83s]  I'm distracting right now. You just get the hits in
[2401.55s -> 2405.79s]  I'm telling you he's looking at you and I think he's attacking you and he does a full spin on me
[2406.11s -> 2409.07s]  All right. Well, hold on. Let's see if I can do this. I can't take like one hit
[2412.38s -> 2428.90s]  My mimic tears got this
[2442.80s -> 2445.12s]  I dodged that's what i'm saying
[2446.08s -> 2451.57s]  Actually, I remember there being like an actual delay on dodge rolls in this game
[2452.86s -> 2507.58s]  No, that's not the problem, madam
[2507.58s -> 2509.10s]  He's won. He's won
[2509.10s -> 2544.21s]  Does this boss have two phases? I hope not a different one
[2546.11s -> 2548.11s]  Oh, he pulled. Okay
[2548.51s -> 2550.66s]  fucking
[2550.66s -> 2555.94s]  No, I got I got so screwed there. He did the fire thing in a bit too many times. I I had it I had it
[2557.65s -> 2559.65s]  Like what can we go get some items?
[2560.05s -> 2561.17s]  Yeah
[2561.17s -> 2568.91s]  A little bit. I had it too. Okay. I'm following you
[2569.55s -> 2571.55s]  All right, let's get let's do
[2571.63s -> 2576.94s]  Get on the horse
[2576.94s -> 2578.86s]  And let's get to
[2578.86s -> 2580.54s]  Let's go clear
[2580.54s -> 2583.55s]  What the fuck was that? All right
[2583.55s -> 2587.71s]  So we need to get out of here. Let's move like over here. Let's just go down here clear this out
[2588.99s -> 2593.31s]  Isn't there there's a chest down here, isn't there? Yeah, we can get that. Yeah, let's let's just play
[2593.95s -> 2595.95s]  Get it. Let's just play
[2596.99s -> 2598.11s]  All right guys
[2598.11s -> 2604.72s]  Today we're doing our just play of elden ring. Mm-hmm. Uh, here's here's the room
[2605.36s -> 2609.58s]  Watch out. Yeah, watch out. Watch out. We got
[2609.58s -> 2618.37s]  Yeah, I know so funny. This is literally my least favorite item in any from software games. It's like this this frost
[2620.03s -> 2624.83s]  But I don't know what happened to my body. My mind just went somewhere. I don't know what i'm i'm
[2625.87s -> 2629.22s]  What happened to my mind dead body? Oh shit
[2631.30s -> 2636.00s]  He's in the game dude don't die dude don't die i'll take the hits
[2636.96s -> 2643.58s]  I'm shooting at me. All right, we have to pull this thing out. Let's pull this guy out
[2645.07s -> 2646.27s]  You're gonna die
[2646.27s -> 2648.27s]  I got him. Oh nice
[2653.70s -> 2659.18s]  All right, hopefully you get something out of this
[2659.18s -> 2660.94s]  Why is there like another guy here?
[2660.94s -> 2665.42s]  But she fell off the I killed the wolf but not the girl. Is this an npc? Oh, no, no. Okay
[2667.02s -> 2669.02s]  I got some thin beast bones
[2669.42s -> 2673.57s]  Yep. All right, let's go downstairs. This is gonna be a big item
[2676.43s -> 2678.85s]  I hope for your sake. I hope for my sake too
[2679.49s -> 2690.40s]  I'll just leave them. What are you doing? I'm trying to do backstab
[2693.38s -> 2700.83s]  That's what we should be doing man. We should be trading off backstabs. I can't really backstab the wolf
[2702.10s -> 2710.21s]  All right, let's see
[2712.16s -> 2714.72s]  I'm gonna let you open it because I feel like you deserve it
[2719.57s -> 2721.25s]  Golden lune
[2721.25s -> 2725.73s]  Wet stone knife. What is that? Yeah, that's for uh, that was for the upgrading your weapons. You need the
[2726.45s -> 2730.82s]  I think that's always there
[2731.06s -> 2733.38s]  What did you get a golden moon?
[2734.02s -> 2736.66s]  three eight hundred soul point
[2737.62s -> 2739.22s]  important v
[2739.22s -> 2740.91s]  I mean v
[2740.91s -> 2743.79s]  Vv important v important. What's vv?
[2744.43s -> 2750.22s]  Vv important. What are you talking? Who is saying this to you? Somebody said vv important and they tagged me
[2751.87s -> 2756.88s]  Okay. Well, let's get the chest in the back here. I don't know if you want to fight the godskin noble
[2757.28s -> 2761.76s]  He's probably not that tough. I feel like the godskin noble would be harder than the worm
[2763.74s -> 2773.01s]  Yeah, he should be scaled as a normal enemy hp not boss hp. Oh, okay smithing. So I have a lot of smithing stones
[2773.57s -> 2789.46s]  Yeah, just do all right. Let's see if it's let's see if it's scaled. Uh, no
[2790.27s -> 2794.72s]  It is not
[2794.72s -> 2796.26s]  Okay
[2796.26s -> 2800.42s]  Well, we're already doing it. So you want to just run get them. I actually think we can get them
[2800.50s -> 2802.50s]  Okay, well, I don't have any healing left
[2802.66s -> 2805.07s]  Oh
[2805.07s -> 2807.15s]  And if you can still I think we can get them you think so?
[2807.87s -> 2834.61s]  Yeah, i'm dead. I'm not
[2834.61s -> 2840.61s]  This is this would actually be ridiculously easy if one of us did have magic to just stand around and be the asshole
[2841.17s -> 2844.85s]  That throws magic at him god. Oh, oh good luck. You're
[2845.57s -> 2847.57s]  There's no hope for you. I'm alive
[2848.53s -> 2857.76s]  It didn't kill me. I'm alive level fucking 25. Oh god. Damn it. Don't
[2868.00s -> 2874.08s]  Thrust weapons, I hate these things. Yeah, i'll give you i'll give you the anchor
[2875.97s -> 2881.90s]  No, I'll wait
[2881.90s -> 2884.22s]  I can't I can't reach him and you got you
[2889.06s -> 2890.56s]  wrought essence
[2890.56s -> 2894.67s]  hopelessness
[2894.67s -> 2896.96s]  Wait, why did I get that?
[2896.96s -> 2906.03s]  Wait, what's going on? Sometimes an enemy might fall off the map or something. Maybe you just I don't know i'm dead shit
[2907.38s -> 2911.22s]  My actual souls that I need to be one tenth the level of you
[2911.94s -> 2919.12s]  Oh, I also did get an item for dying wrought essence. Wait, this this thing reduces your mind. Can I delete this?
[2924.61s -> 2931.60s]  Reduces maximum health it's part of the mod sit at a grace to delete it
[2933.84s -> 2941.06s]  What? Yeah, I got a weird item that what's the point if it resets because if you die you're out of grace
[2941.95s -> 2947.94s]  Oh, I don't understand bird. It's balancing for seamless co-op
[2950.74s -> 2953.38s]  Oh, I can I get it. So if you die
[2954.19s -> 2956.19s]  And I try to come back to help you
[2956.67s -> 2959.39s]  And it reduces your to make us so we can't just like jeez stuff
[2960.11s -> 2964.83s]  I see well, I don't think we should do that. Anyway, no, we're gonna try to do this as legit as we can
[2965.71s -> 2967.71s]  Okay, I want to go grab my uh
[2967.71s -> 2969.30s]  My runes
[2969.30s -> 2973.78s]  And then we can go and go anywhere just pick a direction and we're going to go off into the sunset
[2974.18s -> 2978.10s]  All right. Well the logical direction is to go just towards um
[2980.22s -> 2984.98s]  Margot yeah market search of the elden ring
[2985.55s -> 2992.96s]  Why is that logical because that's the first area to go to is it though? Yeah
[2993.95s -> 2997.14s]  What about the castle to the south? I mean we could
[2998.13s -> 2999.92s]  Yeah, we could do that
[2999.92s -> 3001.36s]  Okay
[3001.36s -> 3004.19s]  Is that illogical?
[3004.19s -> 3008.51s]  I'm just trying to remember the thing you just said of hey, where are we going is you should pick where we go
[3008.67s -> 3013.63s]  And then now you're like trying to make me decide somewhere else. Let's tell me where let's go. I'm following you
[3013.79s -> 3017.07s]  Okay, you are the commander. I am your
[3017.71s -> 3018.89s]  hairy
[3018.89s -> 3027.74s]  Companion. All right. Um, let's go. Let's go. We'll go so are you sure about that?
[3028.22s -> 3030.22s]  You didn't want to go to a market
[3030.22s -> 3033.66s]  No, I don't think I actually don't think we're ready for that if that's another hard boss before I can't do it
[3033.90s -> 3043.09s]  I'll make sure you get this
[3043.09s -> 3045.46s]  Oh, I see what what's going on?
[3045.46s -> 3048.58s]  I mean is that when you act when you touch the bonfire to get it
[3048.90s -> 3054.16s]  I auto sit at it because you've already touched it. So I think you getting the bonfire gets it for both of us
[3055.41s -> 3060.93s]  Oh, I just realized that I they I get what people mean now by how I just ruined everything for my character by just
[3061.01s -> 3066.66s]  Spamming everything to strength. Um, I need 3200 runes to level up now and that's not going to happen for like an hour
[3070.35s -> 3074.91s]  I see
[3074.91s -> 3077.54s]  NPC. Oh, it's the
[3078.02s -> 3080.22s]  the
[3080.22s -> 3090.19s]  Clothing guy. What's his name walk or something? Where is he? He's right here golden rune eight
[3092.24s -> 3094.24s]  I've got a pretty fat level up there
[3094.32s -> 3104.30s]  I I don't think I ever helped this guy or came here and got him one time ever
[3105.10s -> 3114.42s]  Really? He's cool. He's got a cool story. Let me guess how his story ends. How do you think it ends?
[3115.62s -> 3117.62s]  Oh, well, it's an elden ring npc he dies
[3118.42s -> 3130.03s]  Oh, wait, he just gave me something sick. Wait, what he gave me throwing daggers
[3132.90s -> 3140.02s]  Uh this npc spoiler alert for those that didn't play. Um, he does not die if you you know, he can die
[3141.50s -> 3143.50s]  right like every npc can but
[3144.54s -> 3147.34s]  There's there's a scenario where he doesn't well
[3147.34s -> 3154.62s]  Let's cut his head off because instead of a like a ball bearing he'll drop something else a bell a bell ball
[3154.94s -> 3158.14s]  I think that in elden ring there's very few things that I mean
[3158.22s -> 3163.55s]  This is like the npc that you do not hurt out of all of them. You sure about that? I am like
[3164.27s -> 3170.27s]  As a general elden ring community, I think this guy is protected forever. Like you don't hurt this guy ever, right?
[3174.62s -> 3178.70s]  Okay, where are we going boss? All right
[3178.94s -> 3183.82s]  Okay, I just was making sure you understood that before you uh, i'm not hurting him. I he's i'm not doing anything
[3186.24s -> 3189.12s]  Don't kill him. Please we we can go do his quest if you want
[3192.08s -> 3195.36s]  You never did any of this do what did you just like run through the game as fast as you could?
[3197.14s -> 3201.86s]  He's the guy that gives you the needle right? Yeah, the sewing needle. Yeah. No, I just I think I just
[3202.42s -> 3212.03s]  Happen to miss him. If I break this do you get why does this guy have so much health?
[3213.66s -> 3215.97s]  Are you gonna you get that?
[3215.97s -> 3222.93s]  Yeah, okay, because this is a misbegotten and he's pretty late game
[3224.51s -> 3226.51s]  Not really
[3226.75s -> 3229.47s]  Late-ish right? Isn't this this is the farmazula people, isn't it?
[3230.45s -> 3231.74s]  uh
[3231.74s -> 3233.74s]  No, I thought this was the castle more
[3234.14s -> 3236.70s]  Misbegotten but they might be in both areas
[3237.10s -> 3243.44s]  Huh? No, this is early game drop a staff you coward
[3247.73s -> 3249.66s]  He's more castle
[3249.66s -> 3260.62s]  Uh beast blood. Oh, I thought that was millennia. It's like a shit
[3262.24s -> 3267.04s]  That enemy does suck though. It I they're one of my like least favorite enemies
[3267.20s -> 3274.74s]  Well one on one if you beat this enemy first try i'll give you 100. By the way, you can't take any damage
[3276.02s -> 3278.02s]  Why you just add shit as I run in?
[3288.62s -> 3291.02s]  I I can't even get near the guy. I'll take it
[3296.45s -> 3298.45s]  Oh sneaky. All right, i'll do it now
[3299.90s -> 3301.90s]  Oh now now i'll do it
[3315.15s -> 3319.07s]  I've got the rot
[3319.07s -> 3321.28s]  and now
[3321.28s -> 3332.59s]  Rot i'm actually scarlet rotting and dying. I need to get to a bonfire. Yeah, this item might be something good
[3333.31s -> 3337.98s]  I'm dying dude, dude. I'm dying
[3339.22s -> 3343.54s]  Dude, i'm dying. Well, just go just go to a bonfire. Um, I can hang out dude. I'm dying
[3344.26s -> 3350.32s]  All right, I don't think i'm gonna make it dude. I'm dying dude. I'm not gonna teleport to the bonfire. Why are you running?
[3350.88s -> 3353.50s]  Ah, i'm roleplaying
[3353.66s -> 3355.33s]  you
[3355.33s -> 3359.07s]  Idiot does that mean what happens now?
[3360.00s -> 3366.08s]  Do I have to die too? No, I think I can just rest you rest and then come back. Okay
[3367.33s -> 3377.65s]  Oh, yeah, you did around you. Yeah, you did. Okay. I think it's different though. Maybe not. Oh, no. No. Whoa, I didn't
[3377.73s -> 3382.45s]  Okay, that was weird
[3382.45s -> 3384.45s]  That guy shouldn't respawn though because he's
[3386.50s -> 3388.13s]  Whatever it is
[3388.13s -> 3393.54s]  Whatever you did. I see you going around but you're not on a horse. Okay, let's just run by these guys
[3394.26s -> 3397.94s]  Oh, this is like a crab this reminds me of like the dark souls, too
[3398.10s -> 3401.22s]  Uh, but when they recreate what was it called scholar of the first sin?
[3401.78s -> 3407.46s]  Yeah, like I guess we'll put a crab and um, one of those casters. It doesn't just call it the first sin
[3413.79s -> 3418.91s]  Yeah, you're riding around on nothing too
[3419.63s -> 3421.63s]  That looks so scary. It looks like a horror movie
[3426.24s -> 3431.74s]  What is going on over there? What's happening over here?
[3434.74s -> 3440.82s]  Is this kind of lagging giant fighting somebody or is he trying to fight us? I think he's trying to fight us but can't get out
[3443.94s -> 3445.94s]  There's like giant bugs in here
[3446.26s -> 3459.12s]  Okay, I think that's a bad idea. So we shouldn't go that way unless you think we can cheese this
[3462.19s -> 3465.79s]  I don't think we can I think he's cheesing us by being in there
[3467.31s -> 3469.31s]  Yeah, he's yeah, this is a strategy
[3472.85s -> 3474.85s]  There is the basement down here as well
[3476.19s -> 3481.87s]  What about the loot? All right, get the loot golden. Oh shit. I got good shit. I got good shit
[3482.11s -> 3485.63s]  I got some real good. I got grumble gauntlets. What is the grumble gauntlet? All right
[3487.79s -> 3488.99s]  grumble
[3488.99s -> 3493.79s]  Grumble gauntlets is what it was. All right coming down. I'm down here. This is a boss. This is a boss down here though
[3495.82s -> 3500.50s]  I don't know where you went. He's still chasing me. Did you go down the hole? I went down the hole. Yeah
[3500.98s -> 3504.82s]  Oh i'm coming. We can definitely cheese this by the way. There's no way you can fit down here
[3510.34s -> 3520.03s]  Go in the hole. Hold on. I need a second. I I found like some high level runes and uh a good sword
[3520.35s -> 3522.35s]  I got the fuck golden epitaph
[3522.59s -> 3524.59s]  Was this one of the ones that shoots like magic?
[3525.15s -> 3530.48s]  Or this was the holy one
[3530.48s -> 3535.84s]  Oh crucible gauntlets. I thought it said I don't know why it looked like grumble like crumble a grumble. All right, you ready?
[3537.09s -> 3542.37s]  Uh, oh, I don't want to lose my souls here, but okay. I believe in us. There's no way we're losing
[3542.37s -> 3544.22s]  Just don't even come in then
[3544.22s -> 3550.62s]  I'm coming in. It's a mad soldier dude. We're fine. It's crazy. He's fucking gone nuts. He's gone bad
[3559.38s -> 3561.38s]  All right, good. So what is in here?
[3562.18s -> 3564.18s]  That guy was that guy was fucked up
[3567.84s -> 3575.84s]  That's not bad runes
[3575.84s -> 3577.81s]  Oh, that's right
[3577.81s -> 3580.21s]  Uh, they sell stuff though, right? Because their shop will be random
[3584.86s -> 3589.02s]  I have the lowest amount of intelligence. Yeah, we have the lowest amount of intelligence you could possibly have in the game
[3589.50s -> 3591.26s]  Can you even talk to her?
[3591.26s -> 3595.23s]  Yeah
[3595.39s -> 3600.93s]  Okay, uh, there's still sorceries, but are these different?
[3601.65s -> 3603.68s]  I feel like these are the same
[3603.68s -> 3605.68s]  Nah, she's selling garbage for me
[3607.81s -> 3610.61s]  Here i'm about to level up
[3610.61s -> 3617.94s]  But actually might be able to do it. All right, so uh chat help me out here somebody was saying
[3618.42s -> 3621.30s]  I can't believe you did that. So how do I fix this points and decks, right?
[3628.72s -> 3632.72s]  Uh, the glintstone blades are intelligence scaling stuff, right?
[3633.28s -> 3637.76s]  I don't want to do like full-on caster and cheese enemies, but I I could go like glintstone blade
[3639.23s -> 3640.83s]  and all that stuff
[3640.83s -> 3642.11s]  yeah
[3642.11s -> 3651.54s]  Yeah, glintstone is uh is intelligent. Just do health
[3652.80s -> 3654.80s]  Only until you figure it out
[3655.28s -> 3661.44s]  I've vigor 17 intelligence 16. I mean I have 32 strength. So I just have to figure out the hell i'm doing
[3662.00s -> 3669.47s]  Dude, you are clapped for the rest of the game. We can find the uh, the respect things
[3670.11s -> 3675.04s]  I think I have to live with this
[3675.04s -> 3677.04s]  I just kind of got excited
[3677.04s -> 3683.74s]  And just put every point in it. I think we're out. Look that was that was fun. We're good
[3688.14s -> 3691.90s]  Actually, a faith could be fun and I already found the weapon like a faith weapon. Hmm
[3694.42s -> 3695.94s]  Oh god
[3695.94s -> 3698.18s]  Why is this aggro range so huge?
[3698.18s -> 3702.02s]  I want to see this convoy and all of the random enemies in it walking together
[3702.18s -> 3705.70s]  I want to see the fucking parade of every enemy in elden ring. That's true
[3709.55s -> 3711.55s]  Uh, he's still behind us. I don't
[3712.40s -> 3715.57s]  Yep
[3715.57s -> 3716.93s]  What is this?
[3716.93s -> 3718.93s]  Um a lobster
[3719.76s -> 3721.28s]  Wait, what is that?
[3721.28s -> 3723.46s]  Why is it like a lobster tree?
[3725.02s -> 3727.98s]  I don't know. I'm not messing with a lobster. Yeah, we got way too much stuff following us
[3728.86s -> 3734.78s]  Imagine you get to the final fight and it's like you have to become an elden lord and you go into the arena and it's a lobster
[3735.42s -> 3737.42s]  That would be awesome. No one would have ever beat this game
[3738.67s -> 3741.23s]  Huge hand huge hand and it's very fast
[3745.04s -> 3750.00s]  Look at how fast that is anime in the game. No. Oh my god. We are disagree so much. I hate those things
[3750.00s -> 3754.16s]  Those things are stupid like design wise the type of enemy that they are
[3755.41s -> 3757.79s]  I like the hand
[3757.79s -> 3760.99s]  All right, but design resting design wise
[3761.87s -> 3765.95s]  Playing against it like actually the actual mechanics the thing has fighting it. Not great
[3766.27s -> 3770.46s]  Okay, just saying if you're gonna be like, oh, I love it
[3771.58s -> 3773.74s]  No, I love like it punching me
[3774.54s -> 3777.02s]  Turning into a fist and like ramming me wherever I am
[3778.05s -> 3785.47s]  I didn't over here. Okay, i'm following you smithing stone. All right, so let's take a look
[3785.87s -> 3792.59s]  We're trying to get to this tower over here. So let's just keep going. I wonder those boss, um the jails
[3793.47s -> 3796.51s]  We should try to do those. Um, but we could get some we get some pretty lucky shit here
[3797.73s -> 3800.93s]  Maybe all right. This is just a vr chat lobby
[3801.65s -> 3803.65s]  Like this is not
[3804.13s -> 3806.13s]  Elevator. Oh shit. All right, go go go keep going
[3809.49s -> 3812.37s]  Plus two
[3812.37s -> 3813.73s]  Where are you?
[3813.73s -> 3817.46s]  I'm behind you
[3817.46s -> 3820.42s]  Somebody said they I think that's alexander. Is it really?
[3822.59s -> 3824.03s]  What? Hey
[3824.03s -> 3827.33s]  Stop don't do that
[3827.33s -> 3833.57s]  I killed the dog
[3833.57s -> 3843.04s]  With the holy blade of the emperor. All right, so let's see what's in here
[3846.78s -> 3859.47s]  Who knows dude, it might be mad soldier too. I hope it's mad soldier. All right be on your toes could be anyone. Oh up here
[3861.01s -> 3864.18s]  What is it?
[3864.18s -> 3866.18s]  It's just a regular ass guy
[3866.26s -> 3868.42s]  No, this guy is one of the most fucked up people
[3869.95s -> 3871.97s]  And I got insta comboed
[3871.97s -> 3874.13s]  Because when he jumps up you get like sunlocked
[3877.62s -> 3880.18s]  Should I try should I try to fight him?
[3880.26s -> 3882.74s]  Yeah, what are you gonna do? What else are you gonna do?
[3884.61s -> 3887.01s]  I don't think he's got that much health, but this enemy sucks
[3904.56s -> 3910.70s]  Shit. Oh, I think he just looks weird because the npcs have random items
[3912.32s -> 3916.24s]  I fucking hate i'm gonna go bare hands. I'm gonna use my bare hands. I hate this thing so much
[3916.56s -> 3922.34s]  I hate frost items in all these games. I'm just using my bare hands. I I think
[3923.14s -> 3932.75s]  A steak. Oh, oh, yeah, I can give you a weapon. I think I found some other stuff. You're that desperate. No, i'm just mad
[3933.86s -> 3938.10s]  Okay, he's just mad. I don't want to fight that guy. He doesn't have that much health. We can kill him
[3938.42s -> 3942.64s]  Let me see. Why are you playing this shit again?
[3943.84s -> 3946.72s]  What this is like one of the best games ever like made?
[3948.96s -> 3953.46s]  This game's fun what come on I think we can do it
[3954.74s -> 3956.42s]  Okay. Yeah, I wasn't ready
[3956.42s -> 3965.74s]  He caught me off guard. I wasn't ready. Make sure you get your souls
[3967.54s -> 3970.74s]  You had me. All right. Don't just go right up. He's gonna do the thing. He's gonna kill you in one hit
[3971.14s -> 3980.27s]  It's just just there you go. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. He's gonna turn to you. I'm gonna do the same thing
[3984.18s -> 3993.31s]  Get him turn around you got this guy
[3996.90s -> 4000.22s]  This is so unfair
[4000.22s -> 4004.66s]  back on the ground
[4004.66s -> 4005.78s]  Uh-oh
[4005.78s -> 4007.78s]  Uh-oh, he did a weird move
[4007.78s -> 4013.22s]  I feel like we invaded some poor player
[4013.62s -> 4015.62s]  Just like and we're just fucking with him
[4021.12s -> 4023.12s]  He keeps trying to do that same move
[4023.12s -> 4025.12s]  You can't cast spells man. We're in your face
[4032.43s -> 4035.87s]  He's just if I get it off if I just get it off both these motherfuckers are dead
[4042.13s -> 4044.98s]  Go up. Oh shit. I'm gonna die
[4049.14s -> 4052.40s]  All right. We're good. We got him
[4052.46s -> 4053.84s]  Honestly
[4053.84s -> 4055.84s]  He got outplayed. Yeah, he did
[4058.43s -> 4060.27s]  royal house scroll
[4060.27s -> 4062.27s]  Oh, come on a scroll
[4063.06s -> 4065.06s]  I got a fireproof liver
[4065.22s -> 4069.73s]  I forget what all that stuff even does I assume fire resistance i'm not gonna I don't want to cast spells
[4069.89s -> 4074.62s]  Well, I gave souls. We're still leveling, you know early game. That's true
[4075.10s -> 4084.11s]  All right, so we did that let's mark it on the map so we don't forget
[4089.49s -> 4091.97s]  I'm gonna say uh, the sword is it was completed
[4092.45s -> 4100.06s]  Okay, do you see that or do you have to do it on your own? I don't see it
[4100.54s -> 4109.52s]  All right, we're gonna trust you. You're the wayfinder. Okay, we can keep going down and you want to just keep going down across the bridge
[4111.42s -> 4113.02s]  i'm following you
[4113.47s -> 4116.11s]  Yeah, but i'm gonna be going like roleplay speed on my horse
[4116.75s -> 4118.27s]  We can do roleplay speed
[4118.27s -> 4128.00s]  That's fine. I'm gonna follow you. Yeah. All right. He's getting back to the road
[4128.64s -> 4138.18s]  Kind of looks like you're kind of looks like you're speeding up there. This is this is what you would be going if you were
[4138.34s -> 4140.10s]  When i'm not going full blast
[4140.10s -> 4152.43s]  I don't know about that
[4152.43s -> 4160.24s]  Let's cross the bridge. Oh, hold on item up here. Ooh
[4165.58s -> 4168.14s]  Oh, it looked like a purple item from way back there
[4170.62s -> 4172.62s]  fire grease
[4173.50s -> 4185.04s]  smithing stone
[4185.04s -> 4187.04s]  I hope the next item you find is a spear
[4187.44s -> 4191.87s]  Sorry, but yeah, that'd be kind of that would be humorous. It'd be comical
[4192.75s -> 4195.39s]  All right. Let's go. Yeah, i'm on team comedy
[4196.11s -> 4198.11s]  Yeah, I mean if you're playing randomizer
[4198.75s -> 4200.75s]  You kind of have to be on team comedy
[4202.45s -> 4204.45s]  Uh item here. Ooh
[4204.85s -> 4210.54s]  What is that thing?
[4210.54s -> 4215.92s]  That thing is this thing is like one of the best items in the whole game. I think isn't it dragon crest shield talisman plus two
[4217.79s -> 4221.95s]  That's pretty good nice
[4222.34s -> 4224.42s]  Yeah, I haven't found a article of clothing
[4225.76s -> 4228.78s]  No, you haven't
[4228.78s -> 4230.14s]  Are we going down?
[4230.14s -> 4235.70s]  I was gonna go across the bridge
[4235.70s -> 4241.86s]  This death drop here or no. Yeah, if you jump down through the wind you won't take damage. Oh, it's all right
[4241.94s -> 4245.76s]  You're good. All right, let's go the wind
[4247.90s -> 4250.38s]  Uh, oh that dragonfly ant
[4251.33s -> 4253.57s]  Is arming the ballista?
[4253.57s -> 4255.57s]  Wait, is it really?
[4255.89s -> 4261.49s]  Oh, I thought it was I got a spell I got gravity well, it was a bug well manning the ballista
[4263.46s -> 4269.49s]  E d. Yeah, what the fuck? Oh one of oh god. I'm sorry for aggroing you. Okay, good
[4269.81s -> 4276.64s]  Okay, it was one of the like the bomb birds. These enemies are lazy
[4277.68s -> 4283.78s]  I think they just have a line of sight that we're just breaking. What is on this? What is on her head? What is this?
[4284.86s -> 4289.68s]  Oh, okay. I thought I was like why is what's like on her head? You can't say that
[4291.07s -> 4301.14s]  I thought it was like I think I thought she was a different character actually does look like she's wearing like a flower pot
[4304.02s -> 4307.94s]  Uh, should we kill her to save the trouble of someone else having to do it?
[4310.69s -> 4315.20s]  Um, i'm not gonna make any decisions on npc killings looks like you already did
[4317.81s -> 4326.59s]  You basically you decide it by not deciding. I hope she kills you doesn't deal damage though
[4332.32s -> 4336.24s]  I'm not your father. I got I got a helmet it was worth it. I got her helmet
[4336.64s -> 4338.88s]  She dropped it. I got a mask
[4342.49s -> 4344.05s]  finally
[4344.05s -> 4350.51s]  Cool. It is I sir knight. Somebody said fuck you, sir
[4358.19s -> 4363.23s]  Jerma just watched I can't hit you. I can't stop you. There's no friendly fire
[4363.95s -> 4365.95s]  Yeah, but you didn't tell me to stop. Um
[4366.69s -> 4369.68s]  item
[4369.68s -> 4374.16s]  Yep, that would have been a laugh out loud comedy moment, but I I had to get away from it
[4374.72s -> 4381.23s]  Isn't there an item here? There is oh
[4382.99s -> 4385.47s]  Oh, it's over though. I there's no we don't lose no
[4386.19s -> 4392.93s]  I literally just got rivers of blood right now noise
[4398.50s -> 4401.06s]  Uh nice, uh, like, uh, I don't I just I just got teach
[4402.27s -> 4405.15s]  Are you fighting everything? I just ran up ahead. No, so I think something died
[4405.87s -> 4413.47s]  Yeah, but I can't you
[4413.47s -> 4417.95s]  I can't use rivers of blood right? That's like that's lame. Isn't it? You can use whatever you want
[4419.58s -> 4420.96s]  but
[4420.96s -> 4425.76s]  I mean like I physically can't because I have 32 points in strength because I freaked out and pressed the button
[4426.56s -> 4431.90s]  Yeah, I don't think you can
[4431.90s -> 4434.46s]  All right. So down here we need to find wisdom map fragment down here
[4444.35s -> 4447.79s]  I've got the academy key. This guy's selling the academy key
[4449.55s -> 4451.07s]  So i'm gonna buy that
[4451.07s -> 4461.73s]  Haven't enough to level up. Oh shit, and he's got smithing stone ones, which is very good
[4461.89s -> 4467.18s]  When I finally get an item, so should I put any points? I feel like I need to put points in dexterity
[4467.58s -> 4482.59s]  What if I what did I do? No only vigor. Okay. All right, do not level decks
[4483.33s -> 4485.01s]  under any circumstance
[4485.01s -> 4489.33s]  Okay

[4526.35s -> 4533.04s]  Okay, let's uh, i'm gonna rest did you add a charge to your flask in the very beginning?
[4534.26s -> 4539.17s]  No, well, I would do it because you picked golden seed didn't you I didn't I picked uh
[4540.88s -> 4545.18s]  Stone key, why would you pick stone key over golden seed?
[4546.98s -> 4553.28s]  Uh, just to make you mad to anger you and you feel the wall between your brain and your skull
[4553.92s -> 4564.26s]  No, oh you thought I was asking you that no, I was reading that out loud. I know but i'm still confused
[4564.50s -> 4577.20s]  No matter no matter where that sentence came from. It's confusing. Yeah, it is isn't it so much shit
[4577.20s -> 4584.54s]  I'm like, it's so overwhelming when you there's so many things to see did I not? Yeah, I did. Okay. I'm ready
[4584.54s -> 4591.10s]  I'm gonna start rp'ing. Oh wait. Yeah. No, no, let's wait till night time
[4592.24s -> 4602.99s]  For the cavalry. I'm curious. I assume you like just can do it and it overrides my game find out
[4605.17s -> 4607.92s]  Until nightfall hit it
[4612.80s -> 4618.34s]  Uh, I don't think it did it. I don't think it did it. I'm the host. Maybe I gotta do it
[4618.82s -> 4623.38s]  Uh, you also sit down while i'm doing it. I don't know i'm sitting
[4625.87s -> 4634.75s]  Uh that seemed to have worked. Yeah, uh chat my chat says host can do it. All right, so where's the night cavalry?
[4634.99s -> 4643.54s]  Well, doesn't this area so I have one of those birds that jumps down at night. I think it does
[4643.70s -> 4650.19s]  Oh, wait, it's just it's just the night cavalry. Okay
[4650.51s -> 4657.12s]  Did this get rolled into just being the regular enemy that's supposed to be here different night cavalry?
[4657.12s -> 4672.51s]  I don't know like i'm not doing damage
[4673.90s -> 4680.16s]  Seems to be very tough. Oh, you're not on your horse
[4694.54s -> 4696.94s]  I'm like not hurting him. He's also really I
[4705.41s -> 4712.43s]  We're all right. I think you're hitting his horse
[4721.95s -> 4723.95s]  Yeah, we're you're hurting his horse. Definitely
[4729.38s -> 4755.73s]  Ouch, ah that lock on game. So, uh, do you want to leave so bad?
[4757.33s -> 4761.49s]  Battles, huh? I was just thinking like I don't know if there is an elden ring to the horse battles
[4762.05s -> 4769.66s]  Sticking with this. I mean we kind of we're here and we're already hurting him
[4770.88s -> 4774.24s]  All right, we'll just get off the horses then and let's fight him one on one two v two
[4775.04s -> 4783.39s]  Dude, my camera keeps unlocking him and it's it's rough
[4802.64s -> 4820.77s]  Ow, ow am I dead? I think you're okay. I just hit the jump button instead
[4821.41s -> 4831.86s]  Where is he going? I don't know. He's running. Uh-huh
[4832.74s -> 4841.68s]  I remember the first time I fought one of these and you like feel so proud you get him off the horse and he
[4841.82s -> 4843.92s]  Instantly just summons the horse again. Yeah
[4844.80s -> 4848.46s]  Dude, I want to target him not the horse
[4849.34s -> 4864.62s]  Why can I not target him?
[4864.78s -> 4868.58s]  All right, have you given up?
[4868.58s -> 4873.78s]  I don't want to say yes because I know you're gonna be like see I I wanted to give up a while ago
[4874.02s -> 4878.66s]  There's no see there's like a there's a let's go. All right, get on your horse and let's get out of here
[4879.38s -> 4885.20s]  Jeremy you have to hit him until he dies
[4885.28s -> 4886.40s]  I
[4886.40s -> 4887.68s]  I don't
[4887.68s -> 4894.58s]  I don't think you he's still behind us
[4895.14s -> 4908.78s]  Make sure you get the map fragment. It's my second ancient dragon smithing stone
[4909.42s -> 4913.57s]  There's a bug with the mod. If you fight on horseback, the lock-on will stop working. Oh
[4914.21s -> 4917.01s]  That is what's happening to me. I was wondering why it was so weird
[4924.10s -> 4925.38s]  All right, where are you heading?
[4925.38s -> 4930.88s]  I don't know. I was just looking around. I like forgot. There was this whole beach over here because I think there's nothing on it
[4931.04s -> 4935.68s]  Let's go to the beach
[4935.68s -> 4937.68s]  When are you gonna do a screaming stream?
[4938.24s -> 4940.24s]  I did one like a year or two ago
[4940.24s -> 4943.36s]  I just turned the uh the stream on I just sit there and I just go like
[4945.98s -> 4947.98s]  And and like it's the stream's only like
[4948.46s -> 4950.46s]  15 minutes that I can't really do for that long
[4953.34s -> 4955.66s]  You just screamed
[4955.66s -> 4959.34s]  Yeah, I just kind of scream and then to get a breather take a sip of water scream again
[4959.42s -> 4961.42s]  And then it's like my throat kind of hurts. I have to stop
[4961.90s -> 4966.30s]  That's cool. I like that
[4967.14s -> 4969.62s]  What is the it's like this headless person?
[4981.15s -> 4983.95s]  Oh, there's something really good here. I don't know what it is, but I hope it's
[4984.51s -> 4989.86s]  I'm glad we came down here
[4989.86s -> 4996.59s]  Great ghost glove ward. That's the highest love ward in the game. Isn't it? I don't know. Yeah it is
[4998.64s -> 5007.97s]  Okay
[5007.97s -> 5010.37s]  That was cool. Now, let's let's check out this area
[5010.85s -> 5014.88s]  with a swamp
[5014.88s -> 5019.84s]  What that call wait? I was expecting the giant to be shooting the crossbows out of us, but he's like
[5020.48s -> 5033.23s]  a bumblebee

[5211.49s -> 5213.49s]  Gross messer. Can I use this?
[5213.57s -> 5216.70s]  How can I not put this on?
[5220.42s -> 5223.31s]  Why can I not use this?
[5223.31s -> 5225.31s]  I can't even equip this in two hands
[5233.46s -> 5238.42s]  Oh my god, give me a break. Why are things up? That thing's a gross messer
[5239.22s -> 5245.49s]  Who handing only works for strength?
[5245.81s -> 5254.05s]  Did you do that?
[5254.05s -> 5259.25s]  Yeah, your character's got so much cooler than mine in like 15 minutes. I have I got one sword
[5259.49s -> 5264.05s]  Yeah, and it's uh, that's the bug weapon. That's the one of the coolest swords. I was I was about to use that in my um
[5264.61s -> 5266.27s]  first playthrough
[5266.27s -> 5273.15s]  He's jealous
[5273.15s -> 5276.51s]  Fucking level 30 character over here. Ooh, look at this
[5278.13s -> 5280.13s]  Just mad. He put it all into strength
[5280.45s -> 5285.23s]  I got a bow
[5285.23s -> 5290.29s]  Is there a boss in here? There is isn't there?
[5291.10s -> 5294.70s]  I don't think I don't even remember ever coming up this way. This is um
[5295.50s -> 5300.45s]  Isn't don't know that there's a guy at the top right? He's like me. I am the leader of this place
[5300.45s -> 5307.89s]  Have you seen my daughter? I got a knight rider glaive. I got a glass you want another thrusting weapon
[5321.54s -> 5323.30s]  That guy didn't even move
[5323.30s -> 5326.14s]  He was in prison
[5326.14s -> 5330.27s]  It's got yeah
[5330.27s -> 5331.47s]  I in all of my playthroughs
[5331.47s -> 5334.83s]  I never came up here and was always wondering where this guy was and I always missed this
[5335.39s -> 5340.27s]  You didn't ever come over here. I don't know how there's just it's a big game and some things you miss
[5342.83s -> 5347.20s]  You know that gives me so much confidence that this game really is as good as it is because
[5349.44s -> 5353.62s]  You saying that how many times did you play through the game at least a few times, right?
[5354.34s -> 5358.50s]  A lot. Yeah, so a lot. That's really cool. The fact that you just haven't even seen this place
[5358.58s -> 5361.78s]  Yeah, every time I did a new playthrough. I was like, I never saw this before
[5362.74s -> 5364.74s]  I missed this on my first one. Uh, we have uh
[5367.62s -> 5374.13s]  Over there should be careful. I don't I don't like this situation. This actually is not good
[5376.42s -> 5378.42s]  Why did you aggro everything
[5379.63s -> 5383.15s]  What are you doing? Why did you ever the whole top? This is my fault
[5383.15s -> 5386.99s]  They weren't already walking over to us. We do we could have killed a few of them
[5392.80s -> 5395.28s]  Oh my god. Thank goodness. I can fix this character
[5396.24s -> 5399.60s]  Oh my god, there are enemies stir must have done this
[5400.56s -> 5413.82s]  I think you can only hurt these guys with blunt weapons, by the way
[5417.06s -> 5418.74s]  Oh
[5418.74s -> 5424.77s]  Uh, you can backstab her but yeah, you might need a blunt weapon
[5427.71s -> 5430.91s]  Um, we're gonna die here. We just need to go. Okay, follow me
[5435.66s -> 5438.22s]  Where did you go? I don't follow me. Actually, it's better do
[5439.26s -> 5442.14s]  I followed you and i'm out of hell. No, no, no, no, because they're back. Oh, uh,
[5442.86s -> 5448.14s]  That's a gigantic centipede monster thing over there. Uh, this is bad. They're casting us
[5448.86s -> 5450.86s]  They're casting us
[5455.74s -> 5460.46s]  Oh my god, what the f don't go that way don't go that way this I got caught
[5462.14s -> 5469.62s]  I'm dead
[5471.22s -> 5477.41s]  Like I said, i've never been up there ever well, um stir there's not that's not what's up there
[5478.13s -> 5482.30s]  I know but like I don't even where we're going you ran into a dead end. You should know that's a dead end
[5482.30s -> 5484.30s]  You're a master of this game, right?
[5486.45s -> 5492.62s]  Okay, we're just gonna get back up. Did you rest again to get rid of your whatever they gave you an idea
[5498.50s -> 5502.98s]  Fix your character. All right, hold on. I know i'm not gonna do that yet because I feel like it's gonna scale all the enemies
[5504.35s -> 5507.31s]  How how would you fix it because I have a golden rune plus 10
[5507.71s -> 5511.31s]  And i'm about to level up like five ten more times. Oh, no, i'm pretty sure you can use that
[5511.95s -> 5516.27s]  I think they're still leveled by the zone that they're in. I was I was saying dumb things before
[5517.90s -> 5530.56s]  Oh, I thought this is way more than it is. There's a boss at this castle andy
[5532.70s -> 5541.14s]  Uh, yeah, we saw it. It was astel. I think because uh that was spamming at us. No, that's my sword
[5549.89s -> 5551.89s]  Why are you a dog?
[5555.38s -> 5557.38s]  I thought you hate it when people were wolves
[5557.86s -> 5566.21s]  What? All right. Wait, wait, wait, we need to figure out where where's the progress route to get up to the top
[5566.96s -> 5570.96s]  You go to the other side of this and you go upright. Yeah, okay. All right, let's not not up the pile
[5571.04s -> 5588.30s]  We can just let's kill these uh, somebody said that was so funny. Mine's too. Yeah, if I get poisoned i'm gonna be so mad
[5591.46s -> 5593.46s]  There's so much poison dust
[5594.83s -> 5605.02s]  Did he heal?
[5605.02s -> 5612.32s]  Why is this guy not dying?
[5612.32s -> 5623.18s]  Yeah, then you can just run along the side ignore blob. That's funny. You got the sleeping rock there
[5626.27s -> 5628.27s]  This is normally a sleepy guy there
[5629.17s -> 5630.77s]  smithing stone
[5630.77s -> 5632.45s]  We're getting a lot of those
[5632.45s -> 5638.14s]  Oh, it's a mog like enemy
[5640.11s -> 5642.11s]  These guys are actually horrible. Aren't they?
[5642.74s -> 5644.74s]  Oh, no, no. No, I know. I thought it was a bog like it's not
[5652.62s -> 5654.99s]  Do I hate those guys too with the bow?
[5655.55s -> 5662.78s]  Well, they can shoot you from across the whole game, right? Those things. Yeah, they're so annoying. Don't look up
[5665.15s -> 5669.55s]  Please be respectful. I I can't guys. What is he talking about eyes forward?
[5670.11s -> 5673.71s]  I thought you meant that there was like a something very scary like a monster or something. No
[5674.43s -> 5677.79s]  It was my bare body that cannot find clothing
[5678.51s -> 5683.54s]  All right. We need to be careful here because there is a gigantic giant up here
[5690.78s -> 5692.98s]  Item up here too
[5692.98s -> 5699.63s]  That's so scary. I don't think we're going to be able to get to that part. Uh, they're kind of right in the way
[5700.19s -> 5704.59s]  Oh, I didn't see the gigantic astle in the sky. You didn't see that. That's what was killed
[5704.59s -> 5706.67s]  That's what that's the first time i've noticed it
[5707.47s -> 5710.21s]  What?
[5710.21s -> 5712.69s]  It is shoot. Oh, yeah, that that's what I was saying
[5714.66s -> 5716.66s]  I think this is a run scenario
[5716.90s -> 5719.22s]  Oh god
[5719.22s -> 5725.28s]  Okay, let's uh, let's pull aggro pull him back. Okay, we can kill this giant
[5738.72s -> 5742.56s]  Okay, this is a run angle. Yeah, this is a run now. Why are you why are we fighting this?
[5742.56s -> 5744.72s]  This is a run scenario. It always was
[5745.68s -> 5747.68s]  And you left me with the fucking guy with the battle act
[5748.40s -> 5752.54s]  There's a bar feeder on me
[5752.54s -> 5756.26s]  Is there i'm learning the names?
[5756.26s -> 5758.26s]  All right, hide hide for a second
[5760.56s -> 5764.88s]  This thing is invincible we're in so much trouble, uh, we gotta go down here, right?
[5768.02s -> 5770.02s]  Yeah. All right. Let's reset them
[5773.92s -> 5774.96s]  All right
[5774.96s -> 5776.40s]  Reset
[5776.40s -> 5780.82s]  Okay progress
[5780.82s -> 5784.14s]  All right. Everything's good to go
[5784.38s -> 5790.54s]  Sounds good
[5790.54s -> 5792.94s]  Where are you? I went down the rocks
[5794.51s -> 5798.59s]  Oh, yeah. Oh, there is a boss down at the beach right with the uh, yeah the misbegon
[5801.39s -> 5803.78s]  Whoops. I I really did that
[5804.42s -> 5808.19s]  I really did this I did this to myself and there's a fucking brutal enemy down there
[5810.58s -> 5812.58s]  Uh, there is that there's a mogul like down here
[5813.25s -> 5816.85s]  This is a run angle. Uh, i'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna do it, right?
[5824.53s -> 5825.89s]  That just happened
[5825.89s -> 5832.59s]  Where the hell are you?
[5832.59s -> 5835.98s]  Something in my nose. I went down. I did that I went the right way
[5837.02s -> 5839.33s]  Okay, well i'm further ahead
[5839.33s -> 5841.57s]  The right way isn't this an npc bridge?
[5842.90s -> 5845.94s]  Wait, how come I can't tell this isn't this isn't this the guy?
[5857.68s -> 5859.68s]  Run saved you got a larval tear
[5860.16s -> 5862.98s]  Oh god, okay. Wait
[5863.06s -> 5865.18s]  um
[5865.18s -> 5869.66s]  Where you're all the way down, right? I jumped off the side of the bridge to get on the roof
[5872.02s -> 5874.54s]  Uh
[5874.54s -> 5876.30s]  Oh, okay. You're right there
[5876.30s -> 5878.86s]  Um, I want to go up that ladder and get the item that's up there though
[5879.68s -> 5891.39s]  Okay, I already jumped down you can do that if you want i'll wait. I was in a bit of a panic
[5894.02s -> 5895.54s]  Oh goodness
[5895.54s -> 5899.94s]  I'm rooting for you
[5904.46s -> 5919.54s]  Okay, I thought what he came whatever that ladder is pretty hard to get up do I laugh like a cartoon character
[5920.80s -> 5922.00s]  Do you laugh?
[5922.00s -> 5923.55s]  um
[5923.55s -> 5936.58s]  Sometimes uh, did you respawn? I did
[5937.46s -> 5939.46s]  Oh, you didn't want to spectate me
[5939.62s -> 5943.38s]  No, why would I want to spectate you? I'm i'm coming because I could just go up here and get the bonfire up here
[5943.38s -> 5944.58s]  And then we could have
[5944.58s -> 5952.29s]  I thought it was like an honor system where if one person dies
[5961.92s -> 5966.67s]  That my game just lagged for a second
[5966.67s -> 5974.13s]  Come on, you see you're all the way down, right? I'm resetting the enemies. Yeah
[5974.69s -> 5993.94s]  That's a bear. What?
[5994.02s -> 5996.02s]  Why is it? Well, I thought wait, all right
[5996.42s -> 5999.94s]  Okay, I got a crustacean amulet or something
[6004.24s -> 6013.62s]  I don't think the bear can get out of this door. All right, this is an opportunity for us to kill this
[6021.92s -> 6027.04s]  I nuked him. Nice. That thing is so good. It really is. I should have used it in my playthrough
[6027.84s -> 6031.12s]  Get off my friend
[6031.12s -> 6033.12s]  This is his bear is in the way
[6033.92s -> 6040.83s]  Are you ever gonna play elden ring?
[6041.89s -> 6049.26s]  um, no
[6049.26s -> 6053.18s]  Absolutely not. I was thinking about it the other day during my scream, uh stream
[6054.14s -> 6055.97s]  I was sitting there going
[6055.97s -> 6057.97s]  What the fuck am I doing man? Like why am I doing this?
[6057.97s -> 6061.17s]  I'm like trying so hard to be funny and shit and like I could just be playing elden ring
[6061.81s -> 6067.47s]  Like I think I was like this eighth or ninth scream and i'm just like this is i'm trying way too hard
[6067.63s -> 6069.87s]  Wait, did you really do a scream stream?
[6070.91s -> 6073.26s]  No
[6073.26s -> 6075.90s]  You thought that was real something i'm missing here
[6076.94s -> 6081.46s]  Squad move up. All right, let's go
[6106.80s -> 6108.72s]  dagger
[6108.72s -> 6113.90s]  And a cookbook lame
[6120.02s -> 6122.02s]  Do it like you fucking mean it
[6124.02s -> 6138.58s]  That you ever go back here to the secret cave
[6140.26s -> 6141.46s]  secret cave
[6141.46s -> 6144.10s]  There's just I guess it's not really a cave but back here
[6145.79s -> 6150.91s]  Is there something back here? I think usually there's something there's something relevant back here like a weird sword or something
[6151.63s -> 6153.07s]  really
[6153.07s -> 6154.11s]  Yeah
[6154.11s -> 6162.80s]  I don't think i've ever been back here
[6162.80s -> 6164.40s]  like a
[6164.40s -> 6165.60s]  million
[6165.60s -> 6167.28s]  squid back here
[6167.28s -> 6172.50s]  That's cool. I didn't get anything good, but cool
[6175.81s -> 6177.01s]  All right. I got
[6177.01s -> 6187.92s]  Uh, I think i'm all right. This is the slowest enemy i've ever seen
[6189.28s -> 6191.28s]  And you're waiting. Uh, yeah, but
[6203.01s -> 6206.29s]  I hope the uh, the boat enemies summon like random
[6207.17s -> 6209.17s]  dudes and not just the same skeletons
[6214.46s -> 6217.28s]  I would imagine it's probably
[6217.28s -> 6218.72s]  Something different
[6218.72s -> 6229.39s]  All right. What do you think we're gonna get in here?
[6229.39s -> 6230.51s]  um
[6230.51s -> 6235.57s]  I think we're gonna get a uh
[6236.90s -> 6241.04s]  We call them by the way, I think that you upgrade your elixir with
[6241.52s -> 6243.28s]  oh
[6243.28s -> 6246.88s]  Crystal tears, I can't believe how fucking cool. This is right like I
[6247.76s -> 6250.24s]  I wish this was just in the game normally
[6251.65s -> 6255.33s]  Yeah, this is so much better. This is a million times better
[6256.91s -> 6261.71s]  Did you ever play neo 2 and does anyone know if that actually even has multiplayer because i've been wanting to oh god
[6261.95s -> 6267.63s]  It's an actual boss
[6267.63s -> 6269.63s]  This is a bad place to fight this too
[6270.17s -> 6272.17s]  37 damage. Oh no
[6280.08s -> 6296.40s]  Shit wait, I might just walk off the edge. Is that possible?
[6297.70s -> 6299.15s]  um
[6299.15s -> 6305.54s]  I don't think so
[6305.54s -> 6307.86s]  We really deal no damage to every boss we fought
[6312.48s -> 6314.00s]  Oh my god
[6314.00s -> 6316.80s]  Of course, it's not going to go anywhere else. There's nowhere else for it to teleport to
[6317.52s -> 6330.24s]  I even dodged too
[6330.24s -> 6348.11s]  It's so awkward. All right, it's gonna spawn literally right here
[6350.46s -> 6352.80s]  again one more
[6352.80s -> 6354.08s]  um
[6354.08s -> 6356.08s]  That actually might be a strategy here
[6356.08s -> 6360.61s]  It's way to put the teleport and whale on it. Yeah
[6367.28s -> 6369.44s]  It would be so funny if it just fell in the ocean
[6369.76s -> 6371.76s]  Oh
[6374.21s -> 6380.00s]  Looks like it was possible
[6380.00s -> 6382.80s]  There's so many look at all these fucking random animals
[6388.37s -> 6402.78s]  Jump on you. Oh my god, but oh, please don't kill me
[6403.58s -> 6405.95s]  I'm dead
[6405.95s -> 6419.47s]  This is uh, totally doable if you want to wait, uh an hour. I'm willing to wait as long as it takes me to do it
[6438.93s -> 6445.49s]  Yeah, that's that's all right
[6445.49s -> 6448.85s]  Let him cook. I'm letting him he he has the whole kitchen to himself right now
[6449.25s -> 6451.73s]  I really don't want to be in this kitchen for this long
[6452.85s -> 6454.85s]  Like I should be getting paid overtime
[6455.25s -> 6465.23s]  Yeah, but you'll have the achievement or you know on stream you beat this
[6465.95s -> 6470.35s]  alone
[6470.35s -> 6474.83s]  You know what you should do is go stand at the very edge where the world stops and try to get him to jump
[6474.91s -> 6477.22s]  And land over the edge of the world
[6479.07s -> 6481.23s]  I don't a lot of the bosses will avoid it
[6481.87s -> 6483.87s]  I feel like i'm gonna walk off by accident
[6484.35s -> 6489.20s]  Okay, here it is
[6489.20s -> 6490.00s]  Okay
[6490.00s -> 6500.54s]  This is menacing
[6500.54s -> 6503.41s]  Uh, uh, yeah, he's he's not gonna
[6504.53s -> 6507.25s]  No
[6507.25s -> 6520.37s]  He's gonna slide me off
[6520.37s -> 6522.43s]  Oh, hold on
[6522.43s -> 6525.18s]  Oh, please
[6525.18s -> 6527.18s]  No, he's like clipping. Yeah
[6527.74s -> 6530.90s]  in the air
[6530.90s -> 6533.97s]  Yeah halfway
[6533.97s -> 6535.97s]  You're a medulla line of cheetos
[6538.22s -> 6539.34s]  Please
[6539.34s -> 6542.30s]  If you would if you could do that for me, please. Oh man
[6543.02s -> 6545.02s]  After gamer session
[6545.02s -> 6551.23s]  What's that person even talking about? I what is this what just happened?
[6552.03s -> 6558.35s]  It oh, yeah, it heals it heals what it kills all of the animals in the area and heals off of them
[6561.46s -> 6571.84s]  What the fuck?
[6571.84s -> 6574.96s]  And all of the animals are in a pile. So I think it just hits all of them
[6578.16s -> 6583.60s]  Yeah, every single animal in that actual boss's encounter room are spread out over the course of like a mile
[6583.92s -> 6592.08s]  Okay, so uh, let's vote to i'm gonna like teleport out of here. So all right, we know that's there
[6592.64s -> 6596.42s]  Can we at least get the item that's up there?
[6597.50s -> 6599.74s]  Up where with the mog like enemy is blocking the way
[6600.69s -> 6602.69s]  Uh, we would have to go back a bonfire
[6603.66s -> 6609.10s]  We would oh we would okay, so we gotta go to the that's one behind the castle, right?
[6612.75s -> 6614.43s]  How do I vote?
[6614.43s -> 6616.85s]  You just pick it
[6616.85s -> 6627.54s]  Like pick the same one as you. Yeah, I think we probably both do it like in the same. Yeah
[6629.82s -> 6633.92s]  Go to caitlin
[6633.92s -> 6646.96s]  I feel like we need to get through limb grave before we decide to go to k. Uh caitlin. Are you here?
[6647.52s -> 6648.80s]  Yeah, oh
[6648.80s -> 6651.09s]  Oh, yeah loads longer
[6651.17s -> 6653.17s]  Okay, so we need to
[6653.57s -> 6655.57s]  Is this I think it's a chest up there, right?
[6657.87s -> 6661.23s]  Uh, there's usually a good item up there. It's not guaranteed that there will be
[6661.95s -> 6677.22s]  Oh, let's try
[6677.22s -> 6681.70s]  You know what? I would want to do if I was calling the shots you you absolutely can call a shot if you want
[6683.15s -> 6685.39s]  You know the chest that makes you go to bed and teleport you
[6686.03s -> 6688.03s]  to the crystal mine
[6688.27s -> 6689.89s]  I would go there
[6689.89s -> 6691.09s]  We can do that
[6691.09s -> 6697.28s]  Especially because when you run around the mine you just like smithing stones or something else
[6697.92s -> 6701.52s]  And you can run around the swamp and pick up a whole bunch of items there
[6701.68s -> 6703.68s]  What happened to the mog like enemy that was here?
[6704.40s -> 6707.84s]  I don't know what a mog like is. Is it a new genre of game?
[6708.48s -> 6714.46s]  I mean, I feel like you you know, you know and like you're not like part of our secret club
[6714.54s -> 6716.54s]  So kind of have to figure it out
[6730.62s -> 6737.89s]  All right, you can you can join secret club if you do this secret secret club handshake. Don't look up. Okay, you ready?
[6738.45s -> 6740.62s]  It's put your hand out
[6740.62s -> 6744.94s]  You shake hands you go like this you go like this you part the hair twice
[6745.58s -> 6750.54s]  You nod you nod you nod elbow elbow elbow to elbow elbow to elbow finger finger gun
[6751.10s -> 6753.10s]  Okay, and then kiss
[6754.06s -> 6759.95s]  Okay, a mog this item is worth it for you a mog like enemy is
[6760.85s -> 6762.85s]  It just is I don't know. It's a stupid
[6763.63s -> 6765.63s]  This fire grease. It wasn't worth it
[6765.63s -> 6772.42s]  Um, it's just those big burly guys that kind of look like mog. They're like the blood enemies big ones an omen
[6772.50s -> 6778.43s]  Yeah, a mogan mogman mogman omen an omen enemy
[6779.07s -> 6785.73s]  An omen mogman. They're like the blood omen enemies. They have that we called them mog likes because I thought people
[6786.29s -> 6797.22s]  There's a whole thing. You're gonna have to go read like where we going first step starting. Uh bonfire first step
[6797.38s -> 6798.58s]  Why do you want to go all the way back here?
[6798.58s -> 6807.26s]  You don't want to explore the other stuff on the peninsula. I told you where I wanted to go. Follow me
[6807.82s -> 6822.50s]  Okay, delete your way markers. I'll keep them because I like to remember where I was. All right, follow you
[6823.95s -> 6827.66s]  Oh, we should see where the dragon is
[6828.70s -> 6835.63s]  I wanted to go into down into that area where that's the teleport chest. Okay, lindell soldier
[6837.54s -> 6838.98s]  I'm ignoring him
[6838.98s -> 6841.66s]  So do you want to see who the dragon is?
[6841.82s -> 6845.58s]  It looks like it's a dragon. Uh, it's the way worst dragon
[6846.06s -> 6850.70s]  Isn't that uh surrounded by a whole bunch of like goons in his vr chat lobby as you put it
[6852.13s -> 6854.29s]  But we're not going we're not doing that. I want to go in the hole
[6858.94s -> 6860.94s]  This dude's spawn in with a ballista
[6865.60s -> 6872.77s]  Yeah, it's uh, it's four to sex. Yeah, okay straight down this hole. There's a lot of shitty enemies here. I hope you uh,
[6873.41s -> 6875.09s]  I wish you the best
[6875.09s -> 6880.53s]  I'm down and there's and there's a lot of enemies down here and he's blowing a trumpet
[6884.75s -> 6886.37s]  uh
[6886.37s -> 6887.92s]  They're gonna
[6887.92s -> 6891.44s]  Oh my god. Wait, I need to how do I say I need to sit in the mist. I can't get in there
[6892.00s -> 6894.00s]  All right, I can't get in the mist
[6894.56s -> 6921.92s]  Good luck. Oh my god, please barf trigger. Don't kill me. All right. I made it. What do we got? Is that hold on?
[6922.08s -> 6926.27s]  I may have actually just been
[6926.27s -> 6927.23s]  Shit
[6927.23s -> 6928.83s]  I can't use it
[6928.83s -> 6932.67s]  You ready?
[6932.67s -> 6934.67s]  I'm as ready as i'm ever gonna be
[6942.29s -> 6946.77s]  Yeah, I don't I don't care what enemies generate in this area. There's no way it could be worse than what it actually is
[6947.57s -> 6965.52s]  That's true. That's so true. It actually made the area way easier. Okay. This is the one that has the
[6966.48s -> 6968.80s]  Uh elevator that goes up and down and you can jump off in the middle
[6971.73s -> 6988.10s]  Okay, we're gonna run around the swamp grab some stuff. Oh i'm hitting this first try
[6988.74s -> 6991.62s]  Never mind
[6991.94s -> 6993.94s]  All the invisible thing
[6994.02s -> 6996.75s]  Yeah, this one's annoying
[6996.75s -> 6998.27s]  dung beetles
[6998.27s -> 7014.46s]  Well, you just gotta stand in one spot. I'm not doing it. I'll do it. Yeah, I gotta stand in the right spot right here
[7016.32s -> 7017.36s]  ow
[7017.36s -> 7020.32s]  Um, this is not a place for us to be standing in one spot
[7020.80s -> 7034.40s]  You'll be all right
[7034.40s -> 7036.40s]  And I look forward to being able to let's go
[7037.04s -> 7039.04s]  I want to get this thing
[7039.68s -> 7042.24s]  It's gonna be like a fucking dung. It's gonna be

[7199.20s -> 7201.20s]  There's a stone sword key. What did you get?
[7201.44s -> 7203.92s]  Uh golden rune three. Where did you go?
[7204.64s -> 7211.97s]  I went I went back down because that's a boss arena with a dragon in it. Yeah

[7226.53s -> 7228.45s]  All right. So what is your
[7228.45s -> 7231.81s]  Why are you here? What was your plan here? You want to just run around?
[7232.45s -> 7238.00s]  No, there's like, uh the city over here has a whole bunch of items in it. We just got invaded
[7238.72s -> 7254.78s]  It is one of those ulcerated tree spirits up there. We're not getting up there
[7255.74s -> 7258.05s]  It is no way this is
[7259.81s -> 7265.89s]  This is not happening man. This is worse than I thought it would be because of all the fucking gigantic enemies out here
[7266.21s -> 7270.29s]  It's not like slow swamp enemies anymore. It's everything you don't want. Okay
[7273.23s -> 7275.52s]  I got one of the uh
[7275.52s -> 7280.19s]  I will meet you at the round table hold. Yeah, i'll see you at the round table
[7280.43s -> 7285.66s]  Okay, i'm gonna see if I can grab some shit. Somebody said comic con
[7288.58s -> 7291.38s]  Also all the people you can buy stuff from at the round table
[7292.10s -> 7295.60s]  Gives a lot of item options
[7298.88s -> 7300.88s]  All right, are we going to the round table hold or what?
[7301.60s -> 7303.38s]  Yeah, go
[7303.38s -> 7309.02s]  No, i'm saying like this is taking a while and i'm saying yeah go
[7309.74s -> 7316.61s]  Are you there now? No, but I can join you. I think we have to do the vote teleport, right?
[7320.10s -> 7322.78s]  Um, no, i'm i'm there
[7323.97s -> 7330.27s]  Okay, this was not worth it in my mind. It really is comic con usually running through here
[7330.27s -> 7334.51s]  you can grab a bunch of good stuff, but now it's all like flowers and and useless nothing and
[7335.23s -> 7336.75s]  God to your enemies
[7336.75s -> 7343.15s]  What somebody got hurt who just got hurt? I just heard somebody go like
[7351.20s -> 7353.44s]  Gideon looks fucking ridiculous
[7355.17s -> 7363.70s]  It's a different guy gideon looks like he's playing world of warcraft with a bunch of like level 25 greens
[7365.73s -> 7380.13s]  That's where I came out of right?
[7380.45s -> 7384.77s]  Yeah, I think it would be better to run along inside the mine than come out here
[7385.33s -> 7389.98s]  Okay, i'm just gonna come to you
[7391.50s -> 7393.50s]  This is corin yeah
[7394.38s -> 7400.50s]  He still kind of looks like thematically accurate doesn't he where'd he go?
[7405.41s -> 7418.24s]  Oh you respawn them. I wonder what you sell aspect of the crucible horns
[7418.48s -> 7421.68s]  Oh, oh, yeah, you can't do it from this very one bonfire
[7421.76s -> 7430.35s]  Did you say that you were gonna do magic because bordasaxe's lightning spear is on this guy. Uh, I mean that's that's faith, right?
[7430.91s -> 7436.91s]  It's faith, but this is arguably one of the best. Um, isn't this one of the best weapons in the game?
[7437.07s -> 7443.90s]  This is like one of the best a spells in the game. Isn't it pretty good. I don't want to
[7444.86s -> 7446.86s]  Do shit that cheesy
[7448.30s -> 7452.38s]  I just I don't want the situation where one guy's like taking aggro while i'm throwing projectiles
[7452.38s -> 7464.80s]  I can't wait to see the blacksmith. Wow, what an absolute gigachad and a game full of randomization
[7465.18s -> 7490.02s]  He doesn't give a shit. He's just wearing the same clothes weird
[7490.66s -> 7500.66s]  Wait, you're just wearing corin's outfit with horns on greetings. Great. I am fear circumscript
[7501.06s -> 7510.18s]  Perhaps you might share with me doing so and you do you think it's where I come from that your disdain is but should come pain
[7510.90s -> 7517.62s]  This game is so good
[7517.62s -> 7519.38s]  Are you here?
[7519.38s -> 7522.74s]  Not yet. I had to go to a different bonafire and I haven't gotten the one yet
[7522.74s -> 7525.22s]  I thought there was one where I am and there is not
[7526.67s -> 7528.19s]  it was like
[7528.19s -> 7532.03s]  These like this, uh, uh, this I can't even describe this
[7533.50s -> 7535.66s]  It makes me laugh every time I see it though
[7544.00s -> 7545.23s]  Oh
[7545.23s -> 7550.83s]  Got the middle finger filet. Oh, I caught you not doing the pose
[7551.55s -> 7576.30s]  Oh shit, you missed your acting cue. Can I use any of this? I don't think so
[7580.27s -> 7582.27s]  Insane weapon. What the fuck
[7583.73s -> 7594.99s]  Yeah, but I can't I don't have enough decks to put it on the key
[7600.83s -> 7605.44s]  I mean the key this is
[7608.10s -> 7610.10s]  Did you on purpose make the worst build?
[7610.10s -> 7613.70s]  No, I just freaked out and put every point in strength because I thought it was like holy shit
[7613.86s -> 7615.86s]  Well, look at this academy key
[7616.77s -> 7623.06s]  I already got one. Yeah, I already got one. I just saved money
[7627.66s -> 7629.10s]  I can't touch this
[7629.10s -> 7641.55s]  Oh, okay. You do that every time what put every single point in strength. No, I didn't I played I played like a
[7641.79s -> 7646.67s]  I played like an int dex character warp to the round table to hold
[7647.84s -> 7650.24s]  Um, I guess i'll agree because I think we both have to
[7651.68s -> 7652.80s]  I thought you were already there
[7652.80s -> 7658.08s]  I am but I think I have to like accept it for you to be here too. Maybe because i'm already here
[7661.54s -> 7663.94s]  Now it put you standing next to me and I didn't teleport
[7664.62s -> 7671.57s]  You look at 10 year old at subway who realizes he can ask for unlimited cheese. I probably have to leave
[7672.54s -> 7676.62s]  Yeah, let's uh do teleport back to the first bonfire. Yep first
[7691.31s -> 7693.31s]  Wait, well you can get unlimited cheese
[7695.10s -> 7702.02s]  You know now, okay, so now
[7703.30s -> 7705.78s]  If you say go to the round table hole do we both get to go?
[7706.58s -> 7710.18s]  I already did. Oh you did. Okay. I think it's cute the round table hold. I think is
[7711.46s -> 7713.86s]  fucked up for multiplayer here
[7715.36s -> 7717.36s]  I wonder if we can both do it again
[7717.36s -> 7719.92s]  Okay, i'm gonna do it. I already voted. Okay
[7720.66s -> 7732.05s]  You voted to warp to the round table hold. I guess it does work. Yeah, there you are. Cool
[7732.53s -> 7740.93s]  I am milania blade of mikala. Did you see uh, get in I just got here
[7741.81s -> 7747.33s]  Oh, I thought you said you were already here. No, I haven't been here yet. I gave this guy a death root
[7750.46s -> 7755.26s]  I had found one of those it doesn't have any clothes. Okay, that was weird. I thought I didn't have any pants on
[7755.58s -> 7764.98s]  We got mogue

[7834.37s -> 7838.69s]  The npcs all have different outfits for stir. Oh because the items are randomized. That's right
[7838.93s -> 7857.47s]  Yeah, is this what gideon's face looks like underneath the helmet or is that randomized to bloodhound step?
[7857.79s -> 7868.66s]  They're selling me bloodhound step, but i'm poor so gideon has long white hair interesting
[7877.20s -> 7879.09s]  They have faces
[7879.09s -> 7881.25s]  I've seen the dung. Um the dung eater's face

[8034.93s -> 8036.45s]  She has all the
[8036.45s -> 8050.18s]  Super crazy. All right, let's go kill this motherfucker outplayed. I'm using a big long extra long toothpick right now
[8058.58s -> 8072.21s]  What? Watch out for the dragon

[8082.91s -> 8090.10s]  It was our crush
[8090.10s -> 8091.62s]  ah
[8091.62s -> 8093.62s]  Now you should go talk to the two fingers
[8095.10s -> 8097.10s]  I hope the two fingers is
[8097.87s -> 8100.03s]  Like a I don't know like a rat or something
[8102.51s -> 8104.19s]  The grand rat

[8164.22s -> 8167.50s]  I'm out. I'm out of here the fun. Hey fun fact, dude
[8167.50s -> 8171.34s]  The weapon you have that toothpick weapon is one of the top 10 worst items in the game
[8172.22s -> 8176.78s]  Okay, we're gonna do what you wanted to do from the beginning and see how fate would have gone. We're gonna go up to
[8177.58s -> 8183.54s]  Morgoth no, you want you want this fight rest at the grace?
[8184.34s -> 8186.02s]  Wipe that debuff

[8188.74s -> 8191.46s]  Okay
[8191.46s -> 8197.10s]  Easy. See I was only I was only dying because I had like four debuffs and I don't know how I got them
[8200.14s -> 8204.06s]  You're supposed to be like the gamer and like you're good at stuff. I'm still naked
[8205.30s -> 8207.78s]  You're like 20 levels 30 levels higher than me
[8216.77s -> 8218.88s]  Oh, no
[8218.88s -> 8220.64s]  It's not
[8220.64s -> 8236.27s]  Eat this
[8236.27s -> 8238.58s]  Why are we not doing that this strategy?
[8238.58s -> 8242.08s]  Because he rolls
[8242.08s -> 8245.65s]  Get ready get it get it get it get it
[8245.65s -> 8248.37s]  All the npc fighters in this game. We need to just do that too
[8249.09s -> 8256.06s]  he rolls
[8256.06s -> 8257.50s]  And what happened there?
[8257.50s -> 8295.98s]  Dude, he almost fucking double killed us you I can't get I can't get a solid backstab
[8297.02s -> 8301.06s]  All right, just keep the distraction up
[8301.06s -> 8305.94s]  Yeah, just do just do that. Just do that just run away and cast that spell and then he turns on me and i'm so slow
[8306.58s -> 8316.40s]  How was that not a backstab after I hit him? He turned damn it
[8317.04s -> 8320.62s]  How many estus is uh, is it two or three?
[8321.79s -> 8340.06s]  um
[8340.06s -> 8356.86s]  What was that weird shit? I would have had the backstab. How many of those does this person have?
[8357.42s -> 8361.41s]  That has to be the last one. I don't I think this
[8362.05s -> 8364.05s]  I think the other equipment
[8364.05s -> 8366.05s]  That she has is a
[8367.39s -> 8369.39s]  Like 10 estus flasks
[8376.11s -> 8388.03s]  Nice yeah, don't do it. Don't do it. I'm so scared of the fire
[8388.43s -> 8394.05s]  I
[8395.36s -> 8398.16s]  Okay, all right, you're gonna also die there you got this dude
[8398.24s -> 8403.06s]  All right, but just you should maybe you should be alive. So i'm alive
[8409.26s -> 8417.36s]  They're invisible to me. Oh my god. It's over. We're gonna lose
[8421.58s -> 8425.68s]  I can't see them
[8425.76s -> 8431.28s]  What did you do? What did you do? I respond him. What do you mean you respond? How did you do that?
[8431.28s -> 8434.08s]  I came down here and they're invisible to me and then they invaded again
[8437.09s -> 8439.09s]  Oh my god, dude, are you kidding me?
[8439.97s -> 8445.54s]  It's because you weighed it I
[8447.01s -> 8448.13s]  you
[8448.13s -> 8450.86s]  You hesitate it
[8450.86s -> 8453.34s]  I wanted you to get the item if I die if you die
[8456.05s -> 8468.67s]  Just rest rest of the other round. I'm just gonna die then we're not messing this up again. Okay, we're good
[8471.94s -> 8474.02s]  You got to read chat between attempts big guy
[8474.98s -> 8476.98s]  You sounded like a train whistle
[8479.09s -> 8482.74s]  All right. What do we need?
[8482.74s -> 8484.43s]  Upgrade the shirt
[8484.43s -> 8488.59s]  I don't want to upgrade the toothpick because I don't know if we're gonna get enough smithing stones to even complete anything
[8488.59s -> 8495.18s]  What's going on down there?
[8495.18s -> 8499.54s]  I don't know you seem
[8499.62s -> 8501.62s]  What the fuck just happened?
[8502.90s -> 8508.40s]  She was waiting for us, man. She was waiting for us. I don't see her
[8509.46s -> 8512.42s]  I resummoned her the whole this whole thing might be fucked now
[8512.58s -> 8517.14s]  Do we have to resummon her again you landed on the ground? I didn't even see the fire that killed you
[8518.64s -> 8520.64s]  Are there two of them down there?
[8521.44s -> 8523.44s]  No, but I think it's desync
[8525.50s -> 8530.06s]  Can we leave at least like if you want to fight this we can leave and come back because something is fucked up
[8531.18s -> 8535.22s]  All right, we keep hold on
[8535.22s -> 8537.14s]  I'm gonna die
[8537.14s -> 8539.14s]  Die save i'm dead
[8539.38s -> 8543.14s]  All right, too bad on my screen you jumped off landed on the ground
[8543.14s -> 8551.68s]  There was nothing there and then you just died on fire just traveled to and from the round table
[8552.00s -> 8561.01s]  Okay, let's just all right. You know what? Let's just leave we're gonna leave. I want to fight margott. Okay, let's go
[8561.73s -> 8565.44s]  Gate front and let's just run to margott front and
[8567.89s -> 8569.81s]  Yo, right
[8569.89s -> 8571.89s]  We never you know, we never even did
[8573.33s -> 8588.34s]  The lizard in the cave. We have made no progress. I leveled up 30 times. I have not all right
[8589.22s -> 8590.64s]  Things are good
[8590.64s -> 8592.64s]  Everything should we make sure you don't have that
[8592.96s -> 8594.75s]  debuff still
[8594.75s -> 8600.51s]  Yo, actually hold on rest at the grace because I have two of them hold hold hold i'm about to crack that
[8600.59s -> 8607.98s]  I'm i'm cracking the case. What do you mean? I actually can upgrade to plus five on a weapon. I have the whole
[8608.62s -> 8612.30s]  Chain she's asking me about torrent again
[8613.47s -> 8617.65s]  Now she wants me to go around I was already at round table. He broke it
[8626.80s -> 8630.96s]  Why does he still have this? All right, so we debated if we were gonna trade like trade weapons
[8631.52s -> 8634.64s]  Uh, and we came to the agreement that my game crashed
[8635.12s -> 8642.54s]  Oh, I would imagine something weird has been has been going on because once we went down. Yeah. All right
[8642.62s -> 8652.69s]  Let's just reset it you restart. I um, I crashed so I need to relaunch. All right, let's just reset it reset it
[8653.81s -> 8659.98s]  Just trade weapons. Yeah, but so it's like should we not I think it might be more interesting if we don't we don't trade
[8664.91s -> 8668.51s]  I just that was very weird. I went all the way back here. Oh, you know what?
[8668.51s -> 8672.19s]  I think I got teleported out of the game. I'm just gonna restart the game. It's probably for the best, right?
[8672.51s -> 8679.98s]  Okay. Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna go to round table. I have like a long sword. I can upgrade to five up to you
[8679.98s -> 8681.86s]  Yeah, I think it's more fun this way
[8681.86s -> 8686.02s]  Look if it gets to a point where we can't make any progress then whatever I I don't think that'll happen
[8686.88s -> 8689.12s]  Did you?
[8689.12s -> 8693.84s]  Did you exit the whole game or did you just restart like the my my game crashed? Oh, okay
[8694.59s -> 8699.95s]  I think I don't I think I finally got the millennia go to round table hold and it was like super confused because I'd already been
[8699.95s -> 8704.70s]  There. All right. So should I try to join you? Uh
[8705.50s -> 8710.54s]  Go to a bonfire and see if uh, you can talk to millennia before you rejoin me
[8711.28s -> 8712.80s]  Actually, i'm gonna go to round table
[8712.80s -> 8718.88s]  I cannot and then invite you because my game still feels like it's being a little weird
[8719.84s -> 8724.66s]  I feel like i'm okay
[8724.66s -> 8726.42s]  I go to gate front. Let's see
[8726.42s -> 8733.02s]  Okay, then later I could um, I could just upgrade this weapon to uh,
[8733.34s -> 8736.38s]  Give it a in in ashes of war when I find it if I upgrade a long sword
[8737.58s -> 8744.03s]  I no longer have millennia here. So, okay, give me one minute, sir
[8744.43s -> 8748.35s]  I didn't quit out of the whole game. I just kind of reset this. Okay, sir kind of thing
[8748.35s -> 8763.44s]  So I think we're okay. I don't have any I don't have any runes to do it
[8767.89s -> 8772.88s]  I got a different talisman though. Now. I definitely keep that on
[8775.70s -> 8777.70s]  We also I think it's always in the same spot
[8777.70s -> 8783.41s]  We have to go get the like crystal elixir thing that you get for free at some point at the church
[8785.42s -> 8793.23s]  Did you buy that sacred tear that was on that vendor? I don't think I ever saw one that was you ours are different
[8793.23s -> 8802.82s]  Oh, that's right. It is different. I'm just gonna go grab whatever this uh, are you ready for me to join your game?
[8803.14s -> 8813.31s]  No, i'm upgrading my weapon. You have a plus five long sword. I'm back sniff sniff you died so many times
[8827.07s -> 8834.26s]  Can I put I could put glintstone pebble on it? I'm not doing it bloodhound step long sword
[8842.32s -> 8845.60s]  Yeah, I got a little excited I got like 20 000 runes
[8847.18s -> 8851.23s]  I came into i'm gonna go to the gate house and set up the thing to invite you
[8851.39s -> 8855.84s]  Okay, i'm right there gate front. I brought like five dolls to the casino
[8856.32s -> 8863.09s]  And hit like a 50 000 jackpot and then put 50 000 on red and lost it all like I just freaked out
[8863.09s -> 8866.77s]  I was just like let's go and I put everything into one spot and I just fucked everything up
[8871.42s -> 8878.85s]  My world is open to wanderers. There's level two decks. I'm just gonna put two points in decks. I know everyone's gonna be like
[8880.77s -> 8904.16s]  It's that's gonna be fine. Don't worry. I'm using it. Does your character have a thong on? I don't think so
[8904.85s -> 8915.14s]  Okay, seems to be back to normal. Nice. How's the game audio everybody? Is it audio is good?
[8915.38s -> 8932.61s]  Are we in a good spot? I don't know what that is. But what's happening? Why are you why are you sitting here?
[8933.94s -> 8937.22s]  I'm I took my horse up all the way up the road. Oh you okay
[8937.22s -> 8946.51s]  You were just frozen for me for a sec. I figure we just do stuff up in this direction
[8946.51s -> 8951.26s]  There's a couple of the there's like a jail we can try those aren't dogs
[8951.66s -> 8954.70s]  I love that golden seed was actually a golden seed. Is that not random?
[8956.24s -> 8957.44s]  Um
[8957.44s -> 8967.34s]  It should be it might not be but pretty lucky if that's the case. It's not random
[8967.34s -> 8976.32s]  Yeah, I like actually deal damage now. I'm ready for the real market. I need to all right
[8976.32s -> 8979.62s]  So you want to go beat the you want to go do the worm?
[8981.07s -> 8984.51s]  Oh, we can do that if you feel like that you're confident that we could do. Yeah
[8984.75s -> 8986.75s]  I I feel confident I can kill it
[8986.99s -> 8992.78s]  I mean I can kill it and you can say that we can kill it that we can kill it that we as a team
[8993.42s -> 8996.75s]  okay, just a little bit like you kind of

[9334.05s -> 9352.80s]  It's a faith weapon. Oh, yeah, it's a pretty good sword or axe weapon. It is if I had a 22 faith
[9354.76s -> 9362.95s]  Uh, you need to bonfire. I I won't respawn. I need to bonfire. Yeah, like i'm not respawning
[9362.95s -> 9372.68s]  Oh, i'm just gonna go back to the entrance. Is there anything else in here? Uh, no, what did you get?
[9374.71s -> 9378.76s]  Uh use this wheel the pizza cutter two-hander
[9379.16s -> 9382.12s]  uh
[9382.12s -> 9387.92s]  My game is really freaking out that you teleport it. I rested at the graces that help you
[9388.96s -> 9391.33s]  Uh says you died
[9391.49s -> 9392.29s]  Yeah
[9392.29s -> 9398.42s]  Now i'm respawning there you are. All right, so
[9399.22s -> 9408.20s]  Here so I discard
[9408.20s -> 9413.16s]  Use the wheel. All right. I'm i'm taking all right. We're allowed three trades. I'm taking one of those trades
[9413.16s -> 9415.00s]  I want the wheel
[9415.00s -> 9416.44s]  That's a nice rule
[9416.44s -> 9441.52s]  There you go. Yeah, it's pretty sick
[9441.84s -> 9447.84s]  But I think i'm really like i'm think i'm really feeling the spear right now
[9449.57s -> 9466.37s]  Just feeling i'm feeling the spear for another like at least 20 minutes or I put it on all right
[9466.37s -> 9478.34s]  How much decks do I actually need? All right the next hopefully i'm gonna wish for like a bunch of good runes
[9478.66s -> 9481.16s]  All right. Where are we teleporting to though? Because we?
[9482.00s -> 9484.96s]  Uh up to morgue. Yeah, let's go for it morgue it
[9496.47s -> 9500.58s]  Yeah, i'm gonna be your squire the whole game the way i'm dressed. Did you do the shack?
[9501.72s -> 9513.48s]  Yeah, my game I can't get off the map. I'm like frozen. Did that help? No, i'm stuck on the map and I can hear you walking around
[9513.88s -> 9522.16s]  Yeah, I just sat at the bonfire. It said warp to storm hills. Uh shack bailed. Oh, I I did it again
[9522.24s -> 9537.72s]  I voted again. I think here we go. Okay, good seamless. The axe is just the weapon art for faith. Can I actually use it?
[9542.39s -> 9543.99s]  Um, I have a weapon art
[9543.99s -> 9547.83s]  I can give you as well if you want if you can I don't even think you can change it on that weapon
[9548.31s -> 9550.31s]  I have like earthbreaker
[9551.08s -> 9553.08s]  After war I wonder if this works
[9553.08s -> 9557.28s]  Find out it wouldn't have the x on it though would it?
[9558.16s -> 9560.36s]  I wouldn't
[9560.36s -> 9569.00s]  Uh, yeah, it's the axe. I don't think this is gonna work. Let's try it
[9569.80s -> 9578.37s]  Oh, oh
[9578.45s -> 9579.57s]  Oh
[9579.57s -> 9582.61s]  Actually, no, we're good. We're good. We're good. This actually works
[9583.75s -> 9585.75s]  This is doing this is okay
[9586.23s -> 9590.12s]  Doing more than before my little glint stone pebble on this long sword
[9590.20s -> 9594.20s]  It does the same amount of damage from before if I hit something like 10 times
[9598.23s -> 9600.92s]  All right mount up
[9600.92s -> 9604.84s]  Yeah, I was doing 71 damage before now. I'm doing 91. It has to be something right
[9605.48s -> 9607.91s]  I'm doing like 250
[9607.91s -> 9609.91s]  You got you got to get like the the
[9610.15s -> 9611.99s]  tier one somber stone
[9612.31s -> 9617.67s]  Somebody said no, dude, that sphere is really just that bad. What the hell is behind us? Okay, we're good
[9635.14s -> 9637.94s]  This is our uh, come back arc. I think so
[9638.66s -> 9644.42s]  I think we finally got like the critical mass of items the critical mass
[9645.44s -> 9647.12s]  Oh, do not aggro
[9647.12s -> 9649.68s]  That fucking thing. Oh shit. It's the scion thing
[9651.11s -> 9653.75s]  Oh, it's coming after me. I'm just gonna go up into the tunnel
[9654.55s -> 9656.47s]  Which is going we're just running by
[9656.47s -> 9659.41s]  Yeah, okay kill this guy in one hit
[9668.32s -> 9674.85s]  Yeah

[9678.71s -> 9683.19s]  Homer it's me marge
[9683.19s -> 9687.35s]  Oh, I don't think that we um, we can't afford that bard. Sorry
[9688.07s -> 9689.41s]  Thank you
[9689.41s -> 9701.00s]  He just does it he just he just fucking does it. Okay, let's go fight marge. Is the cutscene gonna be different?
[9701.80s -> 9703.80s]  I hope so. I hope it's like a bug
[9708.98s -> 9712.05s]  If it's the same i'm skipping
[9712.05s -> 9715.97s]  Is it but if a rat it's him is it skip skip?
[9717.70s -> 9721.24s]  Oh, we just fought you what I don't want to fight you again
[9730.00s -> 9737.92s]  Oh my god, hold on i'm dead i'm fat rolling right now because the stupid axe
[9741.83s -> 9742.95s]  what
[9742.95s -> 9744.39s]  What happened to you?
[9744.39s -> 9748.31s]  I jumped over the lava, but it's just it's just doing the walk back and forth
[9749.01s -> 9753.11s]  Mocking us makar the fell omen. Why does it have that title?
[9755.88s -> 9757.88s]  It has the fell omen title
[9761.25s -> 9763.25s]  Oh, good luck. You're gonna take it all day
[9763.97s -> 9770.20s]  Still says the line
[9770.20s -> 9777.94s]  Oh, man
[9777.94s -> 9786.13s]  Back to limb grave
[9786.13s -> 9790.21s]  This is the two-phase version the one that stands up. Oh, this is gonna be awful
[9793.94s -> 9796.74s]  We got this just just fix your fat rolling get naked with me
[9798.47s -> 9800.47s]  Me strong remember me strong
[9800.87s -> 9804.90s]  Okay, let's go that that last one was a test
[9806.77s -> 9811.62s]  How tarnished looks like you may be in search of the elden ring
[9812.34s -> 9839.81s]  Oh, yeah, you can't do that
[9839.81s -> 9841.81s]  This is gonna absolutely screw us
[9847.09s -> 9850.29s]  God damn it. That's why I didn't want to be back. That's why I didn't want to be over there
[9874.24s -> 9884.23s]  Whoa, please don't kill me
[9884.55s -> 9893.72s]  I forget if this is like sakiro and you can jump when he does that attack. Don't don't get the parry. Don't get the parry
[9901.78s -> 9903.78s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, don't go off
[9918.36s -> 9935.86s]  Uh-oh, he's standing up. I don't remember this move said very well
[9936.50s -> 9941.06s]  And i'm out of healing potions. It's a lot of really long wind-ups
[9942.96s -> 9944.96s]  What the fuck is happening?
[9946.02s -> 9955.19s]  Good question
[9955.19s -> 9958.84s]  Oh shit
[9958.84s -> 9960.84s]  Oh the iframes you're right careful
[9967.73s -> 9969.83s]  Sorry, I probably scared you
[9969.83s -> 9980.07s]  I was running away
[9980.07s -> 9986.42s]  What the heck dodge this?
[9987.24s -> 9989.24s]  We gotta get under him again. I shouldn't have run away
[9996.23s -> 10014.87s]  Big swing who wants me but you can have me
[10015.51s -> 10021.51s]  He's coming from me now watch out for the ninja turtle's leg
[10022.55s -> 10031.30s]  I'm trying to get this done
[10031.30s -> 10032.90s]  Oh my god
[10032.90s -> 10045.08s]  There it is kick his ass kick his ass I got the iframes stab at the end
[10047.27s -> 10053.08s]  Okay. All right. All right, back it up. Don't be crazy
[10072.74s -> 10078.66s]  I waited so long for the rule too. I felt like I timed it perfectly what that's fucked up
[10079.38s -> 10080.82s]  What?
[10080.82s -> 10082.82s]  That's fucked up in two ways
[10083.44s -> 10095.99s]  How did he hit his bowl? I was behind I was back where his tail was that's called cheating
[10096.31s -> 10098.31s]  Oh, that sucks. It's all right
[10098.79s -> 10103.96s]  How come you didn't grab your runes? I was focused
[10108.12s -> 10110.20s]  Shit. All right. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it
[10110.20s -> 10118.21s]  We got it. I could feel that coming the whole that whole wind-up. I was like, I can't believe we're about to lose like this
[10119.51s -> 10121.51s]  Boy, I lost the runes. Wait, what?
[10121.83s -> 10123.83s]  Oh, whoops. Sorry. Okay. I'll get him back
[10124.47s -> 10146.47s]  I don't even know what hit me
[10146.47s -> 10156.31s]  Well on him
[10156.31s -> 10158.68s]  stamina
[10158.68s -> 10161.16s]  Careful, I thought you went off the edge for a second
[10161.72s -> 10186.36s]  How did that miss? I can't go over there
[10198.53s -> 10200.05s]  Oh my
[10200.05s -> 10205.33s]  Goodness, dude. No, I died. I I heard the dialogue start and I thought he was gonna phase transition
[10207.25s -> 10209.25s]  But then he did one more attack
[10219.17s -> 10226.10s]  I feel like I should just jump off the edge. I don't think i'm doing this with two health potions
[10264.61s -> 10265.65s]  Uh-oh
[10265.65s -> 10269.54s]  Uh-oh
[10269.54s -> 10278.95s]  Yeah, there's no way I was gonna do that other one. He hates hitting the boss
[10279.35s -> 10284.79s]  This is the one I cannot believe we did not be I gotta get over that
[10285.36s -> 10293.51s]  Okay, if you need a second to rethink your life choices
[10294.53s -> 10297.41s]  Uh
[10298.29s -> 10309.92s]  Yeah, if you need a flower or a rock i've got it by the way
[10313.73s -> 10317.25s]  That was a really weird path that he took. I was so that was
[10319.00s -> 10323.48s]  Okay, and we're stuck in the we're stuck in between that shit. Don't let it get to you
[10327.20s -> 10335.30s]  We go again
[10335.30s -> 10337.80s]  I
[10344.74s -> 10348.42s]  Dude I came in coming in here so confident and it's just weird shit
[10349.14s -> 10351.30s]  I'm dead. No, you're not you're fine. And that doesn't that
[10352.26s -> 10355.94s]  Uh that right of passing skill
[10357.00s -> 10359.56s]  Why have not must truly be in thy veins?
[10360.20s -> 10397.19s]  Somebody said have him drop the anchor for you, but that's two out of three items to trade just do it laughing my ass off
[10398.79s -> 10402.76s]  All right, this is okay focus confidence patience
[10408.61s -> 10421.60s]  Pulling it back chaos is a ladder bro. What are you doing?
[10422.24s -> 10427.36s]  Dude, I don't know. I'm sorry. I just give me the just give me the thing. Give me the fucking weapon
[10427.52s -> 10429.52s]  Do you want me you want me to jump off?
[10429.84s -> 10432.72s]  I just I don't know. I got locked in. I got locked in and I just
[10440.32s -> 10443.84s]  Give me the anchor. I don't have the anchor
[10447.52s -> 10449.33s]  What do you mean?
[10449.33s -> 10461.16s]  I deleted the anchor remember? No when I first tried to drop you the anchor. I discarded it instead of dropped it. Oh
[10461.72s -> 10468.02s]  That's right. Otherwise, I have a knight rider halberd
[10468.66s -> 10470.45s]  I don't think that's it
[10470.45s -> 10474.72s]  Can I use that thing?
[10474.72s -> 10477.12s]  Uh, it's strength and dex how much dex?
[10480.37s -> 10481.73s]  um
[10481.73s -> 10485.28s]  Oh, no zero attributes required put it on the ground
[10490.90s -> 10502.95s]  Shit, how do I do this again?
[10502.95s -> 10504.95s]  Try the pizza cutter. I need more dex for that
[10506.50s -> 10510.18s]  There you go. I'm pretty sure that's a good weapon too. Oh my god. Thank goodness. Let me see
[10510.98s -> 10512.98s]  That's your that's your number two out of three
[10514.18s -> 10518.26s]  Oh, I just threw up. All right, this is the no, this is perfect. Yes. All right, we're good
[10518.98s -> 10545.11s]  Two out of three trades. I know
[10545.11s -> 10547.40s]  Pulling it back pulling it back
[10547.40s -> 10549.40s]  And it hits you with the back swing
[10550.36s -> 10552.68s]  I even was like calling like I know what's going on
[10561.67s -> 10565.40s]  Pulling it back. I dodged through it. I apparently not
[10565.96s -> 10569.84s]  I think you're a little early
[10569.84s -> 10571.84s]  I fucked it that one
[10572.48s -> 10578.52s]  One shot me
[10578.52s -> 10580.52s]  I've been hit by it before
[10580.52s -> 10597.33s]  I just jump off
[10597.33s -> 10599.41s]  Up to you. Okay, it's good. He's got a time
[10600.85s -> 10605.33s]  This game sucks, dude. No, this is not the real game. You probably haven't have you ever seen this before
[10605.41s -> 10614.18s]  This is not how the game is what we're saying. No one's jumping off this time. No escapes back to the war
[10616.95s -> 10621.19s]  Back to the wall. They aren't a war fight strong
[10621.83s -> 10623.43s]  never surrender
[10623.43s -> 10627.70s]  Legolas the inside of my nose is so itchy. Wait, do we have
[10631.12s -> 10634.40s]  No, okay. Somebody said make sure you don't have the debuff that we have to clear. All right, we're good
[10634.88s -> 10638.16s]  No, do you have any like resins you can put on your axe like a lightning resin or something?
[10638.80s -> 10642.16s]  Before you walk in fire grease. Hold on. Let me I'm gonna put some of this shit on my bar
[10642.88s -> 10648.32s]  I'm gonna use every single one of these
[10648.64s -> 10655.38s]  All right. What is it? What is it?
[10655.38s -> 10656.50s]  blood
[10656.50s -> 10657.46s]  rot
[10657.46s -> 10658.87s]  poison

[10704.56s -> 10706.56s]  Come on really doing it again. Yeah
[10710.64s -> 10715.06s]  I dodged into him doing it and that hit me and almost knocked me off the mat. Uh-oh
[10727.91s -> 10730.15s]  I got this dude. Don't just like take a break
[10762.08s -> 10774.08s]  Watch that. Hi. Oh my god, dude. Look at stir. Just doing so good stir soloing the boss

[10794.24s -> 10796.32s]  You're doing you haven't been hit in
[10797.22s -> 10810.45s]  30 straight seconds stir is better than you and stir combined

[10818.77s -> 10820.37s]  It's not funny
[10820.37s -> 10821.73s]  It is though

[10873.81s -> 10880.21s]  He's still in there

[10936.72s -> 10942.20s]  I don't know says I might have to put it down again. You probably do
[10944.68s -> 10946.44s]  I'm in the boss fight though
[10946.44s -> 10948.04s]  Why are you fighting the boss alone?
[10948.04s -> 10953.73s]  Okay, i'm jumping off. I'm gonna put it down. Why are you fighting the boss alone? You're doing your content without me
[10953.81s -> 10959.73s]  I didn't I didn't know how long you were gonna be disconnected. So I was just doing something
[10962.95s -> 10964.07s]  Yeah, i'm ready
[10964.07s -> 10976.58s]  I have used my tiny great pot to allow new wonders to walk into my world
[10977.30s -> 10979.30s]  I am joining
[10979.46s -> 10988.95s]  You are joining another player. I am the chosen one
[10990.04s -> 10992.04s]  I will become elden lord
[10996.42s -> 11002.37s]  I might have to restart my game. Let me reset the game. Okay
[11008.84s -> 11009.72s]  Oh
[11009.72s -> 11014.40s]  That's fine. It's fine. You need it. You need it like a break
[11016.23s -> 11018.23s]  The game was you know, it's getting to your man
[11018.39s -> 11029.35s]  Let's try it. No. Oh you said he you need to use the separation mist
[11029.99s -> 11033.89s]  Do I because it already said you left
[11034.48s -> 11035.44s]  Oh
[11035.44s -> 11039.92s]  Whoa, okay. I am i'm in your world. You're not in a session now. Okay, let's see if that does it
[11042.24s -> 11045.92s]  What am I doing that? Do you put one down right? There's already one down
[11047.32s -> 11050.04s]  There should be yes. Okay. Let's see. I just restarted the game
[11059.83s -> 11063.17s]  No
[11063.17s -> 11065.17s]  Did I reset the game?
[11065.41s -> 11071.25s]  Like should I exit exit exit? Let me see if this works
[11074.31s -> 11081.03s]  Stirr has to restart. Oh, you have to restart. I think he needs to use it. So you have to do the separation mist
[11082.08s -> 11084.82s]  They said just waiting for instructions
[11085.52s -> 11089.60s]  I'm doing i'm finding i'm doing i'm finding i'm finding i'm finding i'm finding i'm finding it. Where is it?
[11091.70s -> 11094.90s]  It's like a big it's like it looks like a moon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[11095.22s -> 11097.30s]  You lost 10 000 viewers. Yeah, it's all right
[11101.83s -> 11106.87s]  A thick mist envelops my world and I am now alone and I look like a pikachu or something
[11107.59s -> 11111.11s]  I don't know why that made my hair weirder way to change the way you looked
[11111.75s -> 11118.64s]  Yeah, my all of my like bodily hair became like paint. Okay, now i'm opening my world
[11118.64s -> 11122.00s]  To watchers once more uh wanderers not watchers
[11123.24s -> 11129.60s]  Okay, and now you're trying to join me joining now
[11142.42s -> 11144.66s]  Yeah, I lost 10 000 fucking viewers
[11146.31s -> 11148.87s]  So happy they're never coming back
[11149.51s -> 11151.11s]  like next stream
[11151.11s -> 11153.43s]  They're they're like, uh, nah, that was it
[11154.15s -> 11156.55s]  So everyone that is coming back
[11157.11s -> 11160.63s]  Yeah, they're not they're gonna miss this shit. That's on them
[11162.76s -> 11165.40s]  I hate when that hits you and you're like dodging it
[11172.40s -> 11174.16s]  I don't want to be in this corner
[11174.16s -> 11183.38s]  Yeah, that's bad
[11183.38s -> 11185.86s]  You're in that corner. You're in that corner
[11186.82s -> 11191.35s]  It'll be fine. Mm. I don't like you being over there. It's too close to the
[11194.37s -> 11196.29s]  What's he gonna do hit me?
[11196.29s -> 11203.08s]  Stir, I don't like this
[11209.49s -> 11211.25s]  I'm farming him dude
[11211.25s -> 11219.73s]  I'm backing up now. You're in the corner now. It's not me
[11224.21s -> 11225.41s]  Oh, yep
[11225.41s -> 11244.44s]  Where am I? Oh you got good backing up. I don't watch out fire behind you
[11246.20s -> 11249.51s]  Thank you for the heads up
[11249.51s -> 11257.67s]  He's gonna pull it back and it has a hitbox the size of the earth
[11258.31s -> 11271.75s]  Gonna stand up in a second. Oh, yeah
[11273.84s -> 11275.84s]  He's been in this corner this entire time
[11279.60s -> 11292.69s]  Oh fucking ninja turtle
[11292.69s -> 11297.56s]  Big swing you've gotten used to that timing after dying twice. Mm-hmm
[11305.70s -> 11312.48s]  No, he got you he fucking stepped on me, dude
[11315.38s -> 11318.24s]  We can't do it dude
[11318.32s -> 11322.56s]  It's like if we miss time that one time we die. I think when we see him go for it
[11322.56s -> 11324.24s]  We need to just run away
[11324.24s -> 11326.24s]  Like not even roll just like walk away
[11330.28s -> 11336.48s]  I'm gonna upgrade my weapon
[11336.48s -> 11343.04s]  Do you have the upgrades for it? I think I have I should hey remember, uh, you only need to use one
[11343.60s -> 11349.52s]  Stone per upgrade. Oh, all right. Let's i'm gonna go upgrade this a couple times
[11353.33s -> 11357.81s]  Wait, what? Oh, that's right. You you you cheated. I forgot I cheated
[11358.29s -> 11364.29s]  Didn't you she said like shouldn't it be like one two then five then ten then ten or something it goes like one three six
[11364.77s -> 11368.69s]  One three six one three six. I'm pretty sure or like one two three four
[11369.01s -> 11369.49s]  Yeah
[11369.49s -> 11370.90s]  but um
[11370.90s -> 11376.74s]  I played randomizer before and like I said, it took me like eight hours of walking around looking for smithing stone threes and it wasn't fun
[11377.64s -> 11379.64s]  oh, it was just like
[11379.64s -> 11381.84s]  extremely tedious
[11381.84s -> 11382.88s]  uh
[11382.88s -> 11393.19s]  Did you go back to the hole? No, did you you're still standing here? I tried to warp to it. I voted to warp there
[11394.42s -> 11400.13s]  Even just one or two times my game crashed
[11400.85s -> 11401.97s]  No
[11401.97s -> 11407.09s]  Yeah, something about round table hold is not great. Maybe we need to go to that other blacksmith and get that waypoint
[11407.25s -> 11421.32s]  Yeah, who's uh not yeah. Oh, yeah in the first church you can blacksmith there. We should do that
[11423.17s -> 11429.48s]  Can you do everything there? Like can you uh, you can just do everything doesn't matter. Yeah, we'll start doing that then
[11429.80s -> 11433.72s]  I think that one has a limit and then you need to find the giant blacksmith
[11433.80s -> 11438.55s]  If you wanted to do everything without going to hold how much is it to upgrade this shit?
[11447.48s -> 11457.09s]  The church has a limit of up only up to plus three. Can I sell?
[11457.65s -> 11459.09s]  Can I sell too?
[11459.09s -> 11464.02s]  You know also if you want to go to that first mine
[11464.93s -> 11466.61s]  I don't think it will be smithing stuff
[11466.61s -> 11472.58s]  But there's still like a ton of items to pick up in those mines the blacksmith can sell
[11472.58s -> 11482.21s]  Oh, I thought it was not the blacksmith but the blacksmith didn't let you do it. I swear. I i'll get it
[11482.21s -> 11484.60s]  Right. It's been a while since I've played elden ring
[11499.39s -> 11508.36s]  690 that's a weird number. Yeah, that's my graphics card. How many what's going on right now?
[11513.91s -> 11517.17s]  All right, so boom i'm gonna upgrade this
[11517.97s -> 11523.81s]  Once because I don't think I can afford anything else. Don't have any just random stupid items. I can just get rid of
[11524.85s -> 11551.33s]  I don't like this
[11551.33s -> 11560.07s]  828 what I can't warp. All right. I this thing is pretty good now
[11560.84s -> 11571.38s]  Okay, I believe in us. I'm gonna put my thing down push your thing down. You sold the rivers of blood your problem
[11571.62s -> 11576.50s]  That's what I should i'm pretty sure also you can sell uh the grave wards for quite a bit
[11576.82s -> 11590.42s]  Which I should do just level this is my first stream. What emotes should I use?
[11591.97s -> 11593.97s]  Uh, you probably should use um, okay. Yes
[11596.44s -> 11598.87s]  I am ready to join you
[11599.51s -> 11601.51s]  Join me do it. It's all on you
[11611.19s -> 11615.11s]  I will say for how crazy and broken and buggy this could really be
[11616.44s -> 11617.76s]  this
[11617.76s -> 11619.94s]  Works pretty smoothly
[11619.94s -> 11625.62s]  This is actually remarkable that we've only had a couple of small bug like crashes in three hours playing this
[11628.00s -> 11639.80s]  All right. This is the one
[11639.80s -> 11644.32s]  That's so much damage
[11644.32s -> 11647.20s]  Come on, bro. I'm dead. I slid all the way off
[11647.92s -> 11653.30s]  I'm supposed to see how much damage I do
[11653.46s -> 11657.06s]  100 that's better
[11657.06s -> 11658.64s]  What was it?
[11658.64s -> 11660.64s]  It was like 90 like 70
[11662.37s -> 11664.68s]  Hey, don't worry. I got this
[11664.68s -> 11667.17s]  Watch this
[11667.17s -> 11671.01s]  Oh, I do germa is so much better than germa and stir. I check this up
[11681.46s -> 11682.66s]  I mean
[11682.66s -> 11686.82s]  I will have to bow to you for all eternity. Really if you beat him right now. Are you serious?
[11687.54s -> 11689.72s]  Yeah
[11689.72s -> 11693.16s]  I even have a fun story if you wanted after this, okay related to that
[11693.88s -> 11718.74s]  Honestly, also, I feel like we would have done this if either of us had like plus one s this
[11730.68s -> 11734.44s]  Sorry, bro. Did your game crash? Mine just did mine did not
[11734.92s -> 11736.44s]  Uh, I crashed
[11736.44s -> 11741.28s]  The ai took over I mean you did say that this wasn't as buggy as it could be a second ago
[11741.68s -> 11743.80s]  So you were asking for it
[11743.80s -> 11747.72s]  Yeah, but kind of like, you know what happens in life or death when somebody drops out of the game like the ai took over
[11747.80s -> 11757.16s]  That's what you were just watching. We doing this or what? We did it first try. Oh, I thought you actually okay
[11757.32s -> 11761.08s]  Yeah, we're doing that we're doing it just first try how what the
[11762.74s -> 11765.22s]  Heck what the why is this health gone?
[11768.44s -> 11770.84s]  Dude, i'm fucking rolling by it
[11782.34s -> 11788.10s]  This the salamander crawl i'll say uh, worst monster move in all dark souls games
[11788.82s -> 11790.66s]  No, it is not
[11790.66s -> 11792.34s]  Not even close
[11792.34s -> 11794.74s]  What's worse than this the bed of chaos?
[11795.70s -> 11798.18s]  The bed of chaos swipe move is worse than this by far
[11799.14s -> 11800.98s]  I don't remember that
[11800.98s -> 11802.98s]  No way. This is not even close
[11809.73s -> 11810.95s]  dude
[11810.95s -> 11814.61s]  Dude, I haven't gotten to participate yet
[11817.78s -> 11825.54s]  And i'm out of flasks
[11825.54s -> 11833.41s]  Fuck but you're out of flasks right now
[11834.29s -> 11837.41s]  Yeah, I i take so much fucking damage
[11847.44s -> 11850.24s]  I I could sense you're tilted right now and it's like fucking up my game
[11851.78s -> 11855.54s]  Well, this whole fight I believed and then you come in and then he walks
[11855.78s -> 11859.94s]  He walks away from you then he walks away from you and then he walks away from you
[11859.94s -> 11863.06s]  And then he does all of your health and damage from walking away from you
[11868.56s -> 11870.82s]  Okay, um
[11870.82s -> 11871.78s]  We should
[11871.78s -> 11873.78s]  One more try and then we'll go explore
[11874.04s -> 11876.47s]  Germa has six flasks
[11876.47s -> 11879.43s]  Yeah, do you yeah, are you for real?
[11880.23s -> 11881.75s]  Where are you?
[11881.75s -> 11890.15s]  I have three flasks. How many mana flasks do you have? I had one because I was actually using glintstone pebble. Why did
[11891.11s -> 11894.56s]  What you using glintstone pebble right now? I was
[11895.52s -> 11900.64s]  I'm gonna take it off. I mean i'll be i'm seeing a lot of omega lows, but we're dying in one hit doesn't matter
[11902.04s -> 11907.96s]  You hey you I have six flasks. That's true, but we're dying in one hit from that move
[11908.60s -> 11912.66s]  skill issue
[11912.66s -> 11916.20s]  silence
[11916.20s -> 11918.36s]  About to go full gamer mode dog. Yo
[11919.40s -> 11921.40s]  Oh want to walk away real quick?
[11921.64s -> 11927.51s]  That's the worst fucking move in any dark so i'm telling you i'm telling you no it is not
[11928.07s -> 11933.99s]  The worst move in all of dark souls. You know, let's just be let's just focus. Okay. You know what I
[11936.37s -> 11938.98s]  Just dodge it dude
[11938.98s -> 11941.78s]  Just dodge it. Why are you not dodging it? You got here in my
[11943.33s -> 11945.33s]  Why why can't you dodge that move?
[11946.13s -> 11948.13s]  If that moves on a problem, why don't you just walk?
[11948.77s -> 11954.69s]  Just spam it three times and put fucking lava on every square inch of the map and push you off with it
[11955.57s -> 11957.33s]  We're fighting this boss
[11957.33s -> 11959.89s]  In the area where he's not supposed to be right now
[11960.45s -> 11965.86s]  That's the issue. All right, relax. We're good. We're good. We're gonna get in there
[11966.93s -> 11969.57s]  We beat him the first try with by the way
[11970.05s -> 11973.89s]  I was using a weapon that was only doing like 60 damage to swing when we beat him last time
[11974.13s -> 11981.25s]  Okay, let's do it again. You finally got six upgraded flasks. It's not the problem. That's not the problem
[11981.57s -> 11985.57s]  That's not the problem. I feel like we would have won if I had fucking six flasks
[11985.81s -> 11989.89s]  I don't think so. You've died in one hit by that move each time
[11996.61s -> 11998.61s]  See look, we're good. Good. Just relax
[11998.85s -> 12003.94s]  No him walking away from you good. You're good. We're not good
[12004.74s -> 12017.81s]  Here he comes again. I'm just gonna like afk because that's that's all
[12018.45s -> 12020.45s]  That's all I got. I'm just gonna afk over here
[12028.05s -> 12031.97s]  You why you're not afking? You're fine. I was while he was running around
[12032.69s -> 12046.79s]  All right. This is a good start
[12046.79s -> 12051.97s]  We're good. Oh my god, dude
[12053.36s -> 12075.09s]  Nice aim not you him. All right, easy
[12075.81s -> 12088.85s]  I the greed was kind of strong there. The greed was a little strong
[12089.49s -> 12091.49s]  the
[12093.41s -> 12095.41s]  You should have ran away from him
[12097.81s -> 12100.13s]  When he faced transitions you can hit him for free
[12100.69s -> 12104.61s]  There was no greed then he just did that one attack and I mistimed it and then I died
[12105.09s -> 12107.09s]  What you did? No, but I'm
[12112.34s -> 12116.26s]  When he says the words and he puts he always puts lava on his sword
[12118.07s -> 12121.35s]  The fuck I'd watched you respawn in you need to rest
[12121.99s -> 12125.67s]  at the bonfire
[12125.67s -> 12127.67s]  You're a coward. We're not cowards. Why?
[12128.31s -> 12141.84s]  That was a good attempt though. This is just how you this is hey, this is randomizer. What's the what's the worst boss moves?
[12142.00s -> 12145.36s]  What's your your least favorite? You were saying some boss. I don't really remember it
[12145.92s -> 12146.80s]  uh
[12146.80s -> 12149.84s]  All of radan's entire move set every single one
[12152.00s -> 12154.00s]  Every single move radan does
[12154.08s -> 12158.24s]  Okay, and and that's that's one through ten and then everything else is like 11 to 12 13
[12159.17s -> 12162.45s]  Yeah, what comes that like we're just gonna pretend that boss doesn't exist. Okay
[12165.83s -> 12167.68s]  um
[12167.68s -> 12170.32s]  I feel like you have to I'd have to like refresh my memory
[12170.56s -> 12174.16s]  But I feel like a lot of stuff in dark souls 2 was unbelievably annoying
[12177.09s -> 12181.17s]  It is what it's usually like the setup of things and not one individual move
[12181.89s -> 12212.80s]  stuck on a fucking tree
[12221.41s -> 12224.05s]  He just hit me with the butt of his thingy
[12224.85s -> 12237.25s]  We're good
[12237.25s -> 12239.01s]  Where did he go?
[12239.01s -> 12240.60s]  Where is he?
[12240.60s -> 12246.00s]  What he deleted me? I thought he was still doing the other side
[12246.64s -> 12260.15s]  You may need to restart the game. Yeah, i'm out of the fight and respawn me. I'm not spectating you
[12264.26s -> 12266.26s]  Okay, so now i'm coming back
[12266.60s -> 12268.84s]  Okay, I want to go let's go through like the first
[12269.72s -> 12272.60s]  And we'll come back. We just need like a 10 minute away from here
[12273.08s -> 12281.76s]  We're gonna go where the dragon is in the beginning go back to the first step. We're gonna go into the fucking the upgrade mine
[12282.95s -> 12284.95s]  Okay, so you want to go to?
[12285.60s -> 12287.60s]  First step the first step
[12291.30s -> 12300.12s]  Okay. Yeah, so we'll we'll come back. We'll be fine
[12300.68s -> 12304.45s]  There's no sense in getting upset by this
[12304.53s -> 12305.81s]  I am
[12305.81s -> 12307.81s]  So happy to be playing games
[12307.81s -> 12312.44s]  My good friend exactly. There's no what's the point of getting upset about this?
[12313.08s -> 12316.29s]  It's a tricky game
[12316.29s -> 12318.95s]  Game's tricky. It's hard
[12319.59s -> 12322.87s]  So you're asking about why I have so many flasks did you not pick up the golden seed at that
[12323.27s -> 12325.19s]  The places where you could we walked by two of them
[12326.13s -> 12330.29s]  Uh, they were not golden seeds. They weren't I thought people said that wait did
[12330.85s -> 12331.97s]  that
[12331.97s -> 12332.93s]  It is
[12332.93s -> 12337.16s]  I don't know. Maybe your seed
[12337.16s -> 12340.68s]  There is a setting so that you can always have those be golden seeds
[12342.04s -> 12344.70s]  And your seed is uh, we're going around
[12347.00s -> 12353.14s]  You don't want to fight this right now, I don't want to I don't want to talk about it. I just want to go
[12353.86s -> 12359.43s]  You know diggy diggy hole
[12360.07s -> 12364.92s]  Or like a shirt of some kind. I would like a plus one to my flask
[12364.92s -> 12368.04s]  So I don't have to use like three flasks every one time I get hit
[12372.72s -> 12380.84s]  Yeah
[12380.84s -> 12404.00s]  All right. People normally suck this bad at this
[12405.28s -> 12410.96s]  Yeah, usually worse. It's usually it this that's that's why people you know, that's why people play these games
[12411.52s -> 12414.29s]  It's because it's usually
[12414.29s -> 12416.29s]  Usually it takes a mugger
[12416.61s -> 12420.85s]  There's fucking fruits growing out of the wall. I was gonna say I picked up like a mushroom
[12451.36s -> 12453.44s]  I miss dark and darker. Did you play that?
[12454.61s -> 12459.25s]  I did a little bit. Is it good? I only played like the first beta and it was actually a lot of fun
[12459.81s -> 12463.73s]  It looks really cool
[12463.73s -> 12467.17s]  Definitely wish it had a little bit more to it, but it was great
[12468.68s -> 12470.68s]  Hopefully when they actually come out in beta
[12471.24s -> 12473.80s]  It will be a lot more right?
[12473.80s -> 12477.46s]  Yeah, like it's still like another like year of development or at least
[12484.56s -> 12505.20s]  Okay, there's a boss down here too. Isn't there should be there's always a boss in the mines. You should do a backflip
[12508.32s -> 12513.76s]  No, i'm good. Watch out pot friend actually is
[12521.19s -> 12522.15s]  ow
[12522.15s -> 12529.96s]  stone sword key
[12530.98s -> 12533.54s]  Wait a minute
[12534.58s -> 12536.02s]  I'm waiting
[12536.02s -> 12538.42s]  I that I think I might that thing actually might be amazing
[12545.35s -> 12547.35s]  great omen killer cleaver
[12550.29s -> 12551.73s]  uh
[12551.73s -> 12559.76s]  Decent I think the axe that you have would do better if you could use it really I believe so
[12565.14s -> 12567.14s]  Uh, where did where are you?
[12567.38s -> 12571.70s]  Uh, we go back to elevator and there's a this one has the jump off point. All right
[12575.20s -> 12581.60s]  Facing forward. Yeah, i'm definitely gonna put at least two three points
[12581.60s -> 12584.80s]  I gotta I gotta put at least like 14 other way other way. What do you want?
[12588.36s -> 12591.80s]  What do you mean other way? Oh, I thought you know because you're facing the other direction
[12609.35s -> 12616.71s]  Okay, so if this is a magma worm in this boss door, i'm going i'm gonna go buy a lottery ticket today
[12617.83s -> 12622.23s]  I I would do the opposite of buy a lottery ticket because i'm fucking sick of him
[12623.19s -> 12641.25s]  Ooh
[12641.25s -> 12643.25s]  Whatever is let him stay there
[12643.81s -> 12661.57s]  Okay
[12661.57s -> 12665.65s]  Okay, can we peek in there? I hope it's another mad soldier
[12668.05s -> 12670.29s]  Love that boss
[12670.29s -> 12671.89s]  Is it a magma worm?
[12671.89s -> 12673.41s]  Oh god
[12673.41s -> 12675.41s]  Oh, this is bad. We're not gonna be able to beat this
[12676.28s -> 12678.68s]  No, we like don't even have a blunt weapon to hit it with
[12680.82s -> 12682.82s]  Let's we can do some damage
[12683.06s -> 12696.00s]  What the fuck what? Okay. What i've been grabbed. I am being grabbed. I am
[12696.96s -> 12700.58s]  Being grabbed
[12700.58s -> 12702.58s]  When he grabbed you my game just froze
[12706.85s -> 12709.41s]  Holy shit, that's fast. I thought it was slower than that
[12715.72s -> 12717.72s]  Oh my god, give me away from the fucking door
[12720.90s -> 12726.68s]  I actually don't know this boss's move set at all. I I never fought it
[12727.16s -> 12730.52s]  I've tried to fight it once. I was like, I don't like this and then I never did it
[12731.72s -> 12737.46s]  I mean you're really kind of supposed to fight this boss with the horse
[12738.42s -> 12758.12s]  Yeah, he's hard to chase down. Oh my god. He just moves around so erratically
[12763.36s -> 12767.04s]  This this is definitely a horse. This is a this is a horse fight. It really is
[12767.60s -> 12782.39s]  I don't know what that is
[12782.55s -> 12788.50s]  It's called it you get on the horse and don't get hit by it
[12794.34s -> 12796.34s]  Every swing you fucking hop
[12796.98s -> 12815.76s]  I he's
[12815.76s -> 12817.76s]  Run run run run run run just sprint trying
[12818.90s -> 12820.92s]  trying
[12820.92s -> 12822.20s]  trying
[12822.20s -> 12824.76s]  But I got like staggered by every single hit
[12825.40s -> 12856.37s]  You got this
[12856.45s -> 12859.48s]  No, I do not he's got this
[12863.92s -> 12867.12s]  Dude every one of his moves. It's like i'm going to the river and then i'm
[12871.81s -> 12874.77s]  Stake of maricop you're supposed to be on the horse for this fight
[12876.31s -> 12878.79s]  No, there there definitely is one of these that is in a mine
[12879.19s -> 12891.14s]  But I don't know if the movesets are the same. I can't remember. We got it. Are we uh sprinting are we fighting?
[12892.66s -> 12905.96s]  Let's go you fight one in the seletano. Really?
[12906.76s -> 12908.74s]  Yeah
[12908.74s -> 12911.62s]  I do think it's like um
[12911.68s -> 12918.46s]  Significantly weaker than the main one
[12919.92s -> 12927.88s]  It's okay. We're ready. We were refreshed on the move set. We're good to go
[12928.44s -> 12933.40s]  Okay, I should get a shield at some point. There were people selling them in the round table the crash hold
[12935.60s -> 12938.96s]  Lower health lesson the horse one has way more magic shit. Yeah
[12960.72s -> 12962.88s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. How did I not?
[12963.76s -> 12974.20s]  Just when did they stop?
[12977.06s -> 12978.34s]  Dude
[12978.34s -> 12980.34s]  Everything he does is just like staggered
[13013.11s -> 13014.07s]  Oh
[13014.07s -> 13016.31s]  That's not good for you
[13016.31s -> 13019.51s]  All right, I hit the thing by accident. I was way off of it. That's all right
[13032.02s -> 13039.12s]  What is it what
[13039.36s -> 13041.36s]  I just keep hearing you scream
[13042.80s -> 13046.32s]  I've been perma combo for like the last minute. All right, we're gonna say sorry. Sorry
[13057.88s -> 13062.15s]  What the fuck just happened?
[13062.15s -> 13064.15s]  Dude, that shit threw me off big time
[13075.70s -> 13088.05s]  Oh, hey, he runs like four times. Okay, you got this man
[13104.80s -> 13110.95s]  What are you talking about?
[13110.95s -> 13115.51s]  Little fucking mr. Six flask over here. Stop it. This is not the time to make this joke
[13135.46s -> 13137.46s]  Stop
[13138.90s -> 13140.90s]  You're gonna make me lose
[13140.90s -> 13144.77s]  Ooh
[13144.77s -> 13158.68s]  I got I got a shield. I got millennia's armor. Cool. Woof. All right
[13158.68s -> 13163.83s]  Well, we got literally no help at all. That does not do anything for either one of us
[13163.99s -> 13169.54s]  We are still at the same exact place we were before fighting the worm. Um, so cool. Well, you got some souls
[13171.27s -> 13180.10s]  That's true. Need you to rest. Oh, okay. Where's the where's the bonfire?
[13180.34s -> 13196.74s]  Is it not just right here? It's at the bottom of the elevator, bro. I almost just walked off to get there, bro
[13209.14s -> 13213.80s]  Let's go to where the uh elixir is good idea
[13217.81s -> 13224.24s]  And then I also gave that guy the the grave root so we can go to uh, talk to beast boy
[13224.56s -> 13233.68s]  I think he gives you an item. You know what I mean? The teleporter that's sitting in the bush. Oh
[13234.08s -> 13236.80s]  That's right next to the where we're going. Anyway, ooh
[13237.97s -> 13245.97s]  Yeah, you like that. Can you just repeat everything you just said? I wasn't listening. Um
[13246.53s -> 13259.83s]  I don't know where the church is where you get the elixir. You remember where it is. I can't find it on the map
[13259.99s -> 13265.99s]  You're talking about you talk about the the the drink where oh you can do like a damage mitigation or you know, explode yourself
[13266.55s -> 13272.31s]  Yeah, where is that? It's not here, right? It's like, uh
[13278.84s -> 13286.93s]  Let's uh teleport to artist shack. I think you have that I was gonna say I think it's over here east of the lake
[13287.83s -> 13295.08s]  East side of limb grave artist. Can you can we vote? Can we vote? I just tried to do it
[13297.30s -> 13311.96s]  I think this would do hit lb. I think that should accept it immediately. Can I not teleport because i'm inside the cave?
[13312.60s -> 13315.72s]  Uh, let's just get out of the yeah, maybe should I get out of the cave?
[13317.17s -> 13323.52s]  I mean I spawned like at the bottom of it. Oh, maybe i'm gonna get out you have to leave
[13347.73s -> 13360.92s]  You think yourself an elden lord you are nothing underneath my boots which boss says that um, what just happened?
[13362.93s -> 13368.82s]  Did you are you teleporting teleporting to the start of the dungeon from the bottom of the dungeon i'm i'm outside right now
[13369.36s -> 13371.36s]  Okay, i'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming
[13373.08s -> 13376.58s]  Or artist shack unless you want to try this dragon
[13378.64s -> 13384.24s]  The big one over here the scary one. Yeah, I mean do you want to just die for a joke?
[13384.56s -> 13391.46s]  Okay, let's go do a joke. I I believe he should have really low health scaling because he's like a loser, right?
[13392.10s -> 13398.52s]  I mean, I maybe it sounds like accurate as long as like we don't get aggro'd by his whole like crew
[13399.41s -> 13404.52s]  I mean, he's sitting on top of it. Well, he's gone. We beat him. It was easy. He's gonna fly in I just
[13413.03s -> 13421.67s]  Yeah, I don't even know where i'm going
[13421.67s -> 13432.50s]  No, yeah, you gotta get off the horse that one shot me there man. I mean, it's definitely doable
[13434.93s -> 13438.64s]  It just you just lay down
[13442.00s -> 13449.16s]  Uh where he's back. All right, are you uh, just respawning or should I just die?
[13449.80s -> 13453.17s]  I just respawn
[13453.17s -> 13455.49s]  Do you want to fight him or do you want to um?
[13456.63s -> 13461.14s]  Something does not look right
[13461.14s -> 13502.60s]  Let's just get out of here gets we go this way he thinks you get the map fragment down here, too
[13503.00s -> 13538.24s]  Okay, you were just flying through the air. Look like you were on a broomstick. So you want to go
[13542.93s -> 13544.93s]  Okay, there's uh
[13547.19s -> 13553.40s]  Yeah, you marked it. Oh, no, I I see it on the map. I'm going to it. Okay, that's just straight this way
[13554.48s -> 13564.07s]  Oh, here's kenneth height. I want to see what he's wearing
[13565.99s -> 13585.83s]  A little bit of a little little fashionista there, huh? He got the latest fall trend. Yeah, she looks all right. He looks all right
[13591.16s -> 13594.04s]  smithing stone one flask of wondrous busy
[13595.68s -> 13597.68s]  Kill him. No
[13600.10s -> 13602.18s]  I'm not wow. You want me to kill kenneth height?
[13603.35s -> 13604.48s]  he's
[13604.48s -> 13609.20s]  One spoiler alert spoiler alert spoilers for this is the spoiler of the entire game
[13610.02s -> 13612.66s]  Kenneth height is one of the only npcs that lives through the whole game
[13613.30s -> 13620.04s]  I mean like pretty he's pretty fucking sick. Don't you think?
[13620.76s -> 13622.12s]  Not in my game
[13622.12s -> 13625.00s]  Because you probably backstabbed him for fun
[13625.24s -> 13630.23s]  Well, didn't his like quest line not finish when the game came out?
[13630.95s -> 13636.15s]  I think that's why he stayed alive because they didn't finish his like whole arc. Oh, well, that's also why I killed him
[13636.71s -> 13643.27s]  You coming down here? Yeah, I didn't want to die a bunch of places to fall. I want to pete real quick
[13644.07s -> 13645.83s]  Uh spoiler is over. Yes
[13645.83s -> 13673.51s]  Okay, stop acting weird. It's not fun
[13686.64s -> 13700.96s]  It is here. You're right for a second. I thought I wasn't gonna be there. Do we even have anything?
[13701.60s -> 13704.29s]  The only thing I have I guess i'll put it on
[13704.53s -> 13712.84s]  Do I have any of the items that should be on this menu here?
[13713.48s -> 13731.33s]  They miss old germa old germa was weirder than this one. What if anything?
[13731.33s -> 13733.65s]  I've dialed back how fucking weird of a person I am
[13734.37s -> 13739.17s]  Wait, what we're dialing back how weird we are. Somebody said stop being weird. I was like, what do you mean?
[13740.40s -> 13742.00s]  we're super normal
[13742.00s -> 13748.72s]  we're going in the
[13748.72s -> 13753.46s]  the stargate
[13754.10s -> 13758.55s]  Kenneth pike
[13758.55s -> 13759.43s]  Oh
[13759.43s -> 13760.63s]  tree
[13760.63s -> 13775.60s]  Grant me sucker
[13775.68s -> 13784.37s]  Oh tree that really is bugleberry. Oh tree the fuck there's a boat here. He's sucker please
[13784.85s -> 13789.08s]  Yeah, it is. You're right. Oh, yeah
[13789.24s -> 13806.13s]  You're giving death root
[13806.45s -> 13809.97s]  Yeah

[13814.74s -> 13819.78s]  Okay, I got like not much. Whoa, what did I get?
[13820.71s -> 13825.75s]  Oh, wow, do you ever got something cool again? I did I got a golden run
[13830.60s -> 13831.96s]  um
[13831.96s -> 13836.90s]  I think the scaling probably makes this boat have a lot of health. Oh, wait the boat's out here
[13838.77s -> 13839.73s]  Yeah
[13839.73s -> 13841.73s]  black blade mariner
[13845.80s -> 13847.96s]  But this guy sucks though, it shouldn't be too bad
[13849.84s -> 13851.84s]  Holy shit. Never mind
[13859.03s -> 13862.23s]  He's gonna aggro some like crazy enemy. That's probably near here
[13872.05s -> 13876.24s]  What the fuck?
[13876.24s -> 13877.76s]  What just happened to you?
[13877.76s -> 13880.36s]  I got crushed
[13880.36s -> 13882.36s]  Weird I didn't see anything hit you. You just died
[13886.48s -> 13888.56s]  It summons the gigantic skeleton hands
[13889.28s -> 13890.16s]  Yeah
[13890.16s -> 13893.65s]  Yeah, so this is the hard one that has way too much health
[13894.21s -> 13902.88s]  I tried to revive you did it work? Yep. Come back
[13903.60s -> 13908.08s]  All right, let's let's go down this road because there's also one of those trees and if you're actually getting golden seeds from them
[13908.95s -> 13911.11s]  Then there should be another golden seed here for you
[13912.69s -> 13916.64s]  um
[13916.64s -> 13919.51s]  Where are you talking about straight down the road?
[13920.98s -> 13922.82s]  Straight down the road
[13922.82s -> 13926.95s]  Where are you? Did you respawn at the where we were just fighting that guy? No
[13928.00s -> 13929.48s]  Oh
[13929.48s -> 13937.12s]  Uh, that was up here, right? He's still yeah, the beast will sanctum. I think you have to vote for it
[13937.76s -> 13939.76s]  How do I do the quick vote?
[13939.76s -> 13941.76s]  Left bumper I think
[13943.88s -> 13947.01s]  It's not it's guard
[13947.17s -> 13953.51s]  Can you do it now?
[13953.51s -> 13963.67s]  No, i'm in combat the viewers are all coming back
[13964.96s -> 13967.14s]  Oh shit, they are. What's up?
[13967.14s -> 13970.02s]  Yo, what up? What up gamers? Uh, let's go somewhere different
[13970.82s -> 13977.01s]  Go somewhere different. Okay. Well, I don't know if you want to go back to fighting market
[13977.89s -> 13980.05s]  I think I think we should
[13981.16s -> 13984.76s]  There's like a million different catacombs we can do but okay. Here's what we're gonna do
[13985.40s -> 13987.40s]  Let's go get the map fragment here
[13987.64s -> 13995.91s]  So let's teleport to the mist wood outskirts right in the middle. Let's get the map fragment
[13996.55s -> 14004.40s]  Okay, get the map fragment
[14005.20s -> 14014.10s]  Take off my runes

[14053.60s -> 14057.28s]  And if I find like a somber stone one, I think I can like fully upgrade a weapon
[14058.79s -> 14060.96s]  You got any somber stone ones?
[14060.96s -> 14063.72s]  I think I actually do
[14063.72s -> 14068.77s]  I have two somber stone ones you can have them. Yo, come here. This is the play
[14069.49s -> 14079.72s]  It's gonna take me a minute because my horse doesn't work. Oh, no, I would only get a plus two
[14080.28s -> 14085.17s]  It's not that important are these random
[14093.70s -> 14094.98s]  so
[14094.98s -> 14098.05s]  You need that stone
[14098.05s -> 14105.62s]  Now let's go down here because there's a bajillion items as you just run along the river, right?
[14106.02s -> 14108.34s]  Oh, wait, this is yeah, this is underground when you go
[14108.98s -> 14114.28s]  Like all the this is where that boss was supposed to be right the uh, the elk or whatever it is
[14115.16s -> 14116.04s]  Yeah

[14121.84s -> 14124.07s]  so um
[14124.07s -> 14126.47s]  Little tail because we're on the long elevator yesterday
[14126.47s -> 14130.39s]  I went out with a bunch of people and we went to a place around here called pinballs
[14130.47s -> 14131.51s]  I don't know if it's a texas thing
[14131.51s -> 14134.79s]  That's like, you know pinball arcade has a whole bunch like the goofy arcade stuff here
[14134.87s -> 14139.59s]  And it had one of those punch machines where like the the punch thing comes down and you punch it
[14139.59s -> 14141.67s]  You get like a score for how hard you hit it. Yeah
[14142.29s -> 14145.49s]  So like everyone in the whole group like 12 people we're all doing it. We're having a good time
[14145.81s -> 14149.49s]  There was like, oh shit like oh you did better. Oh, like I did better and then like this dude comes over
[14149.73s -> 14153.57s]  Super drunk is like yeah, I I do like mma dude like hey guys. What's up?
[14153.57s -> 14154.93s]  This is my name. How's it going?
[14154.93s -> 14157.25s]  And he like did it to like show off in front of everyone
[14158.40s -> 14160.40s]  And apparently like later I saw him all night
[14160.40s -> 14165.36s]  like he was watching people drunk like just sitting in a chair that could have view of that anytime anyone went over there he like
[14165.92s -> 14169.75s]  Asserted himself and like his whole identity was punching this thing
[14171.16s -> 14174.04s]  Uh, it was really weird and then I went and I beat his punch
[14174.52s -> 14176.53s]  Oh, no
[14176.53s -> 14179.97s]  So he came back up to me later and was like, oh, yeah, dude

[14212.29s -> 14215.41s]  I could probably teach you like the right way to do it because I can do probably like nine
[14216.13s -> 14221.80s]  50 or so I notoriously know how to do that very well. I could show you what's the proper technique
[14221.80s -> 14223.80s]  Are you are you being that guy to me right now?

[14579.04s -> 14581.44s]  I still can't use the horse. We're gonna have to reset probably
[14583.04s -> 14586.48s]  Hold on. I think when I get to the bonfire I can we can resolve this
[14601.67s -> 14604.34s]  Okay, I vote it to travel if you can
[14605.40s -> 14607.40s]  Uh, I I don't have that bonfire
[14608.71s -> 14610.95s]  You know, that's why you spawn so far away. You never touched it
[14611.03s -> 14611.43s]  Yeah
[14611.43s -> 14616.87s]  Well, I didn't have the horse and it was irritating me and you started talking about some guy punching stuff and you punching him or something
[14619.08s -> 14620.68s]  You punch the thing
[14620.68s -> 14622.95s]  Yeah punch the thing
[14622.95s -> 14625.43s]  And then the guy came over and told me he can punch things better
[14626.07s -> 14632.48s]  I'm right there
[14632.48s -> 14636.16s]  Wait, you forgot to put the map underground. Oh that wait. Wait. Wait, there is true, right?
[14638.69s -> 14648.72s]  Oh, that is true. Okay, I can I can travel there. I forgot that that existed. Can you um warp with me?
[14648.80s -> 14650.40s]  So I can just get down there
[14650.40s -> 14653.25s]  I want to figure out what this left bumper thing is. It doesn't
[14654.21s -> 14663.70s]  Do anything because you and the horse died simultaneously to the skeleton reset
[14666.68s -> 14668.68s]  Okay, so where's that thing?
[14668.92s -> 14674.36s]  You start with it was like a cool jump to get jump. Okay horse up. I don't have a horse
[14674.84s -> 14677.62s]  Do I need it?
[14677.62s -> 14682.66s]  Why don't you have a horse because it glitched out at me and the horse died at the exact same time in the same frame
[14682.98s -> 14684.84s]  So it broke my game
[14684.84s -> 14686.37s]  one use
[14686.37s -> 14689.16s]  Can I make the jump aside?
[14689.16s -> 14694.26s]  Uh, I actually don't think you can do this without it. Yeah, we'll do something else then we're good. Yeah
[14697.96s -> 14701.16s]  I mean should I
[14701.16s -> 14702.84s]  You're you coming?
[14702.84s -> 14709.81s]  Yeah, it just takes me an extra second
[14709.89s -> 14711.57s]  You look kind of cool now
[14711.57s -> 14713.73s]  Yeah, like i've got like a shirt I can wear
[14719.17s -> 14724.21s]  Man, i'm so fast on this little donkey. How many hours do I spend in a tanning bed a week?
[14726.15s -> 14728.55s]  I I have a story
[14728.55s -> 14729.68s]  so
[14729.68s -> 14731.68s]  before like pax east
[14733.33s -> 14737.70s]  2014 or 2015 or something. There's like almost 10 years ago now. I
[14738.64s -> 14742.16s]  You know as a gamer right and it's like as a gamer
[14742.88s -> 14747.12s]  I didn't really go out that much during the summer at one at this point
[14747.52s -> 14749.84s]  I was like doing youtube videos and all this stuff, right?
[14750.88s -> 14752.88s]  So I was really pale
[14752.88s -> 14757.28s]  And I was like, oh there's gonna be a bunch of youtubers and there's other people there a bunch of people in the industry
[14758.32s -> 14760.72s]  So I I didn't want to be freaking pale
[14761.65s -> 14764.61s]  so I went to a tanning salon
[14765.78s -> 14770.42s]  and I went one time and the people behind the counter were just like
[14771.14s -> 14773.38s]  You know, this is not really gonna do anything and i'm like, yeah
[14773.46s -> 14777.22s]  But like even if it does something at all just a little so I get like a little bit of color
[14778.07s -> 14780.07s]  It didn't do I don't think it really did anything
[14780.55s -> 14786.88s]  I just went into tanning bed for like 30 or 40 minutes do anything if you do it once you have
[14787.04s -> 14789.60s]  Apparently you have to do it like at least a couple of times
[14790.79s -> 14792.79s]  Otherwise, it's like it doesn't it doesn't really do much
[14793.59s -> 14796.79s]  So I went to a tanning salon hound's fang
[14797.68s -> 14799.99s]  Ooh
[14799.99s -> 14802.87s]  You want one of those wanted your third trade?
[14803.67s -> 14805.99s]  Every time an item comes up. No, i'm good
[14807.33s -> 14809.33s]  So I I went to a tanning bed one time
[14809.89s -> 14812.85s]  And it was I don't know. This is weird. I didn't like it. Did you just sit there?
[14812.85s -> 14814.85s]  And it's like and the whole time i'm sitting there thinking
[14816.26s -> 14818.26s]  I don't this is probably like bad
[14819.54s -> 14821.54s]  You're just laying there like real like
[14821.78s -> 14825.46s]  I don't actually need this but I so badly just didn't want to I like I feel like
[14826.18s -> 14831.22s]  I don't know like oh i'm gonna be going in like this like people I may be meeting up with are talking to people
[14831.62s -> 14833.62s]  Oh, wait, what if I do like a meetup?
[14834.02s -> 14838.90s]  I wanted I don't know. I would like oh hey, man, I get a lot of sun. I'm everything's good on this end
[14839.46s -> 14841.46s]  it'd be funnier if like
[14842.56s -> 14844.56s]  it worked too well and you had like the
[14845.04s -> 14846.88s]  I was just like circle art things and
[14847.44s -> 14848.32s]  Yeah
[14848.32s -> 14853.84s]  Like super burnt and like you very obviously you have just you were just in a tanning
[14855.28s -> 14859.99s]  You look weird like I don't I don't get those things. That's that is the whole thing is weird to me
[14860.23s -> 14862.23s]  Why didn't you just go outside?
[14862.31s -> 14865.03s]  Because it was it wasn't I couldn't get sun
[14865.75s -> 14869.03s]  It was like I don't know what pax it was it was like pax east or pax prime
[14869.03s -> 14871.27s]  It was one of them it wasn't in like the summer
[14872.98s -> 14878.10s]  Yeah, pax pax east was always like really shitty weather winter. It was like february march or sunday, right?
[14878.82s -> 14882.58s]  Yeah, it was like may march, but it was still
[14883.46s -> 14886.58s]  We do the weather
[14886.58s -> 14892.34s]  I i'm so jealous of you being able to be on a horse like even with you resting
[14892.34s -> 14897.97s]  You're not getting your horse back. I don't think so. I know where's the bonfire up here. Did we get it?
[14898.21s -> 14905.76s]  Where are you? Why did you want to tan in winter?
[14906.48s -> 14908.48s]  I didn't want to tan. I just wanted to look
[14909.59s -> 14913.75s]  Like oh man, yeah, I go outside. I've i've gotten a little bit of sun
[14914.47s -> 14916.47s]  i'm healthy
[14916.71s -> 14921.09s]  dude
[14921.09s -> 14925.89s]  Trying to show off somebody said I haven't actually rested at a bonfire in like a half an hour really
[14928.00s -> 14931.44s]  Yeah, it's you definitely don't have your horse and you just need to rest at a bonfire
[14932.40s -> 14944.02s]  I thought there was one over here or is it in the next area right here? I think take a seat
[14944.34s -> 14952.24s]  I'm pretty sure I already did this take a seat. I did it already call your horse. Nope
[14954.90s -> 14956.90s]  What is it's like summoning it but not
[14957.84s -> 14963.22s]  I think i'm seeing it and then it disappears. Do you want to load a different zone or something?
[14964.23s -> 14968.31s]  Um, I think it's just bugged. Uh, we could you want to just read?

[15693.27s -> 15706.70s]  Decks, I think I need to do it. I think I have to two decks just do at least two decks
[15708.50s -> 15709.46s]  Okay
[15709.46s -> 15711.46s]  No, you know what? I can fix this right now

[15728.23s -> 15730.23s]  Okay, this is big this fixes it
[15733.00s -> 15735.35s]  i'm thinking
[15735.35s -> 15736.85s]  like
[15736.85s -> 15739.67s]  15 12
[15739.67s -> 15740.97s]  15
[15740.97s -> 15752.17s]  or like 14
[15752.41s -> 15755.61s]  16 12 14
[15755.61s -> 15760.49s]  17
[15760.49s -> 15762.49s]  Like this are we okay? Is this gonna be all right?
[15771.16s -> 15772.52s]  Sure, whatever
[15772.52s -> 15774.28s]  all strength fuck it
[15774.28s -> 15775.91s]  16
[15775.91s -> 15780.97s]  16 12 14
[15780.97s -> 15784.41s]  Is 12 decks enough? I don't think it is. I'm an idiot
[15785.56s -> 15788.44s]  Leave decks at 12 leave decks at 12. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough
[15790.71s -> 15793.30s]  You're an idiot. Why?
[15793.30s -> 15798.98s]  I want to go to round table to upgrade my sword. I thought I couldn't do it as much but I can upgrade it like a lot more
[15799.62s -> 15803.54s]  12 is good, dude, dude 18 decks, please 14. I don't know
[15806.17s -> 15811.30s]  Check the weapons
[15811.30s -> 15814.90s]  Hold on. This is this is really important because i'm gonna be i'm not gonna be able to level up for like another
[15815.38s -> 15818.10s]  Four or five hours stir. I need to get this right
[15819.83s -> 15821.83s]  You're just gonna find like 10 more remembrances
[15822.79s -> 15825.03s]  You say that now but look at what you've had to deal with
[15827.02s -> 15830.57s]  Yeah, but that's me
[15830.57s -> 15834.17s]  I can use this
[15834.17s -> 15836.54s]  I can use this right now
[15836.54s -> 15839.18s]  This needs faith, but that doesn't matter. I can use this
[15839.66s -> 15843.37s]  This thing's pretty beefy
[15843.37s -> 15847.18s]  Use the pizza cutter
[15847.18s -> 15848.78s]  pizza cutter pizza cutter
[15848.78s -> 15852.33s]  18 ducks
[15852.33s -> 15856.33s]  Use the pizza cutter. All right, we need a poll because i'm sorry i'm gonna be like waste a bunch of time here
[15856.89s -> 15860.17s]  Do you want me to put enough points into decks to use the pizza cutter?
[15861.37s -> 15863.53s]  Because this is yeah, this is the decision we have to make
[15864.42s -> 15866.42s]  You're asking me
[15866.42s -> 15868.42s]  I mean you can contribute if you want
[15869.38s -> 15871.38s]  Oh, well, I don't care
[15871.54s -> 15877.56s]  But I wonder if they even shoot if there's
[15880.57s -> 15884.97s]  Pizza cutter sucks. It's dog shit. It's so bad. All right, I
[15887.32s -> 15888.76s]  What a bad idea
[15888.76s -> 15892.17s]  What do you want to do? I'll tell you what I want to do
[15892.89s -> 15896.41s]  Can we go do this at round table? Hold?
[15896.57s -> 15897.45s]  Yes
[15897.45s -> 15913.99s]  Did you say to go?
[15913.99s -> 15917.19s]  I did and then it says you already voted to warp here
[15917.75s -> 15922.07s]  You voted my map is frozen until like the timer runs out
[15922.87s -> 15935.14s]  Okay, it says it failed
[15935.14s -> 15939.90s]  Okay, don't do it again. Okay. I'm not doing it for me to do it might be like a weird host thing
[15940.78s -> 15946.66s]  All right
[15946.66s -> 15948.18s]  That's not
[15948.18s -> 15950.18s]  That's not a big majority
[15950.42s -> 15953.74s]  to vote it
[15953.74s -> 15958.26s]  That's not
[15958.26s -> 15960.74s]  That's 53. That's not that oh shit
[15961.22s -> 15962.34s]  but
[15962.34s -> 15963.99s]  on guard
[15963.99s -> 15968.15s]  Someone's in the round table. What's going on? This looks a little different man. Why does it look so different?
[15968.23s -> 15973.11s]  Actually, I have 40. I don't even have a weapon equipped. I have 40 000 souls right now. Please kill him
[15988.58s -> 16011.27s]  Bro, i'm trying. Thank god. I was about to shit my pants. Can we get a weapon? Can we get something?
[16012.85s -> 16016.20s]  Satisfaction, I thought you got his arm
[16017.98s -> 16021.02s]  Oh, it's over. It's over here. It's over here where he was standing
[16024.60s -> 16028.68s]  Good stuff. No one is standing anywhere where he used to be standing
[16031.58s -> 16037.02s]  No, my round table hold is empty. Oh minus two. The blacksmith is not there. You're not here. No npcs are here
[16037.42s -> 16041.22s]  Yeah, mine is gone, too
[16041.22s -> 16044.42s]  Okay. Now can we like teleport maybe we can do it now?
[16054.76s -> 16056.31s]  Yeah
[16056.31s -> 16057.27s]  this
[16057.27s -> 16059.27s]  Looks yes. I got an item
[16062.39s -> 16071.98s]  I do not nobody's in here. Uh, i'm not there's nobody here. Okay. Well you were just leveling right?
[16072.62s -> 16076.30s]  I just want to I need to blacksmith real quick. Yeah, I you you I
[16076.78s -> 16084.82s]  No blacksmith isn't here weird. Okay, so let's teleport out. Should we try again?
[16096.31s -> 16102.34s]  Uh omen killer is a mog type weapon. I think i'm going omen killer
[16105.05s -> 16113.18s]  I know that it was 53 but you're forgetting about the streamer vote. My vote is worth 5 and i'm going with the mog type weapon
[16118.71s -> 16120.09s]  I think
[16120.09s -> 16122.09s]  Our games are not synced
[16122.65s -> 16127.77s]  Yeah, i'm gonna dismiss i'm gonna like yeah, just use the get out of my world. Yeah, i'll use it right now
[16128.25s -> 16135.99s]  I almost feel like it'd be easier to like
[16136.39s -> 16141.19s]  Dismiss you from the world and then do round table hold we probably yeah, let's do that
[16141.67s -> 16145.11s]  I feel like we spend so much time trying to get there that we could have already just done it
[16146.55s -> 16151.83s]  So just do your thing and then when we're done upgrading then we'll be back up first chance we get we gotta find the uh,
[16151.91s -> 16155.11s]  The other blacksmith that we can use so we can avoid this as well
[16161.83s -> 16165.83s]  Yeah, I am playing as me strong. That's true. I can't go against the me strong
[16166.73s -> 16170.97s]  Uh build what does omen killer use in need?
[16173.48s -> 16175.48s]  Well, you have smithing stone too
[16175.98s -> 16180.07s]  Uh, I probably let's see I do
[16181.98s -> 16183.98s]  I have two smithing stone twos
[16184.60s -> 16188.20s]  Oh, well, you're probably gonna need them unless you're using a somber stone thing. Uh
[16189.24s -> 16195.27s]  What is that? What is the omen killer? Oh, this thing is pretty cool. I like it
[16201.59s -> 16211.24s]  This uses regular smithing stone. So I need it. Okay. Well, this causes blood loss. It does
[16211.64s -> 16226.50s]  Strength infuse it
[16226.50s -> 16233.74s]  Do I have that yet?
[16233.74s -> 16237.42s]  Uh, I don't really have um, I forgot. How do you sell things?
[16238.12s -> 16240.18s]  blacksmith
[16240.18s -> 16242.18s]  Blacksmith has a cell tab
[16242.34s -> 16249.77s]  All right. That being said let's go ahead and do this
[16254.58s -> 16263.02s]  Because I I need it so bad, right? I got i've got dex 12 dexterity. This is good
[16265.80s -> 16267.96s]  I gotta get my my vigor up and my endurance
[16272.81s -> 16273.85s]  Okay
[16273.85s -> 16283.00s]  much better
[16283.48s -> 16285.00s]  So

[16296.90s -> 16305.93s]  When are you gonna when's your guilty gear tournament?
[16307.38s -> 16309.38s]  Don't you they're asking you that?
[16310.12s -> 16314.04s]  Uh, I think they're just saying words directed at you in hopes that you'll read them
[16322.31s -> 16326.15s]  Oh, that's right. You can do that, right? Okay. I forgot you could do that
[16326.85s -> 16329.19s]  150 41 130 61

[16352.23s -> 16357.40s]  Okay, I thought I had more stuff than I thought I had but I didn't have the things I thought I had
[16364.87s -> 16366.87s]  I'm just selling the rune arc. I don't care
[16374.94s -> 16376.54s]  Go ahead and do that
[16376.54s -> 16379.53s]  Why not?
[16379.53s -> 16381.53s]  Actually, I thought there were a thousand not 200
[16390.30s -> 16395.38s]  Okay, where are we gonna meet up?
[16395.38s -> 16401.86s]  Uh, wherever you feel like uh, we can do the rest of the castle that we just unlocked. Let's do that
[16403.37s -> 16406.09s]  Oh, and I need to reinvent you to my world. So i'm gonna go back to
[16406.73s -> 16408.74s]  market
[16408.74s -> 16423.27s]  and invite
[16423.27s -> 16427.35s]  My seal is down. Uh, we could make sure you use the humanity before you try and reconnect
[16427.91s -> 16430.63s]  And i'm standing exactly over here if you can see find my son
[16439.99s -> 16443.43s]  Sell the pizza cutter. I might have sellers remorse if I do that
[16446.50s -> 16450.84s]  I need to make sure
[16450.84s -> 16452.84s]  7800 come on. I'm almost ready

[16463.24s -> 16465.24s]  Peed for like three minutes straight
[16468.02s -> 16471.22s]  Uh, but there are also a lot of items here like at the gate castle
[16471.78s -> 16472.90s]  Yeah
[16472.90s -> 16476.74s]  Uh, and they're all scattered on the floor and you can just open up the main gate because there's no one manning the ballistas
[16477.66s -> 16484.65s]  That's pretty good. All right. I'm gonna take a quick pee break. I will be right back
[16485.38s -> 16491.56s]  Um, give me like two minutes. I might refill this drink to this water. I might get some more water

[16885.96s -> 16908.62s]  Uh, can you use an afigi? Shut the f**k up. Remember just ate a fistful of edibles. I did not
[16909.51s -> 16920.15s]  All right. So I got my new weapon. What is the actual what is that? Oh wait, that's pretty cool
[16920.55s -> 16935.08s]  Looks like a holy buff. Yeah, I have all right attack power with successive attacks. He's fully ready
[16936.10s -> 16940.06s]  All right, let's go. Where are you? Oh, there are so many items here
[16941.18s -> 16954.86s]  Are we going right front door? Yeah
[16954.94s -> 16956.22s]  Did you grab all this shit?
[16956.22s -> 16960.97s]  I don't know if you want to go around and just do the other stuff and pick up items as well
[16961.21s -> 16968.58s]  We can do that. We should probably i'm more used to that route. Yeah, I got golden
[16969.75s -> 16972.30s]  Kill him kill him
[16972.30s -> 16977.03s]  Oh kill him. No, i'm kidding. Don't you should because he steals souls from you. What?
[16989.56s -> 16990.52s]  Yeah
[16990.52s -> 16995.96s]  Did you get his ball bearing?
[16995.96s -> 16997.40s]  Yeah
[16997.40s -> 17001.16s]  Which is good if you take that to the you know, the the shop ladies the maidens
[17001.64s -> 17005.56s]  Then his shop is still randomized at them, but you do miss out on
[17006.12s -> 17008.84s]  The what is it the last smithing stone available?
[17011.45s -> 17013.05s]  I don't know if that was a good idea
[17013.05s -> 17015.82s]  It was a great idea
[17015.82s -> 17021.03s]  What last smithing stone his store has the last like dragon smithing stone in it at the end of the game
[17022.18s -> 17030.33s]  His shit's all randomized. Yeah, but I mean in like the regular playthrough not in this one. Okay
[17030.81s -> 17036.98s]  I'm just saying that's is this a regular playthrough right now? No, i'm gonna saying in jet and regular playthrough. You don't
[17037.70s -> 17045.66s]  He stays around. Well, well actually like for real right now, dude, you're not gonna make it to the end game
[17047.56s -> 17056.02s]  We might not but whatever smithing stone three
[17057.85s -> 17059.85s]  No, demi human mobs
[17063.43s -> 17064.31s]  What?

[17079.03s -> 17093.46s]  Reeves
[17093.46s -> 17099.86s]  Epic that guy was strong. So wait, sorry is this cutscene up here gonna screw everything up?
[17101.88s -> 17103.59s]  um
[17103.59s -> 17105.83s]  Decent odds wait, no, no, no, we killed him
[17107.67s -> 17108.79s]  Yeah
[17108.79s -> 17111.10s]  We also killed him
[17111.26s -> 17113.26s]  He can't close us in the
[17117.18s -> 17128.68s]  He's a mean guy. He'll never become elden lord. I mean if he just ran up there after everything died
[17129.40s -> 17136.87s]  It's like put the crown on or whatever it work. I got explosives
[17146.57s -> 17148.57s]  Yo, I am getting the smithing stones
[17149.38s -> 17151.06s]  This is i'm ramping
[17151.06s -> 17159.82s]  Can you get out of the way?
[17161.58s -> 17163.98s]  I think uh me we might need a
[17165.10s -> 17167.10s]  We might need a full reset soon
[17167.58s -> 17170.46s]  Because every like 30 seconds, you're kind of just teleporting
[17182.68s -> 17184.68s]  oh
[17188.81s -> 17211.90s]  He's strong be strong watch out misbegotten, uh, he's kind of stuck up there
[17212.54s -> 17223.43s]  See what happens watch out watch out

[17234.70s -> 17236.36s]  Yes
[17236.36s -> 17238.76s]  Crystal spear. I kind of like that
[17239.72s -> 17240.76s]  Yo
[17240.76s -> 17242.10s]  actual
[17242.10s -> 17243.80s]  intelligence man
[17243.80s -> 17255.03s]  Yeah, maybe
[17255.03s -> 17257.85s]  Cool. I like my character now what changed?
[17259.62s -> 17260.66s]  uh
[17260.66s -> 17267.46s]  Put on regular just slacks and like a cool cape and a wolf head. Oh, okay. That's all it took
[17268.02s -> 17270.98s]  A nice pair of slacks. We got a raid. Oh, a raid did come in
[17272.31s -> 17274.31s]  from snaps cube
[17274.39s -> 17277.77s]  Welcome everybody playing
[17277.93s -> 17279.54s]  Elden ring
[17279.54s -> 17281.54s]  co-op seamless co-op mod
[17282.74s -> 17286.33s]  I don't know why I just swallowed weird
[17286.33s -> 17295.14s]  Human body is a wonder. It's been pretty good so far. I'll say it's been
[17296.41s -> 17298.41s]  When we first were talking about doing this, I was actually
[17299.05s -> 17304.09s]  Pretty scared that this was going to be every five minutes. We were going to crash or oh I desync
[17304.17s -> 17315.43s]  Oh reset it. This has been pretty great. I'd say he fell except for that right there, but that was it happens sometimes
[17315.51s -> 17319.80s]  It's okay
[17319.80s -> 17322.36s]  You fell is everyone falling just just
[17323.00s -> 17330.63s]  I'm working through something right now. I got oh I can upgrade my sword a lot
[17331.19s -> 17334.06s]  smithing stone two times three
[17335.11s -> 17337.54s]  You're getting a lot of those. I'm not getting any
[17337.62s -> 17348.12s]  Yeah, i'm i'm I think I could hit like plus 15 right now if I go upgrade. Did you just do you know the button?
[17354.41s -> 17355.93s]  Oh god
[17355.93s -> 17357.93s]  Oh god, what is that?
[17358.49s -> 17362.33s]  I forgot. There's an enemy that like jump scares you there and it's a fucking bear
[17362.33s -> 17364.33s]  There
[17364.65s -> 17366.81s]  I pressed it. I swear to god
[17371.24s -> 17372.20s]  I
[17372.20s -> 17375.88s]  I pressed it. I'm why you would not do that three times
[17376.36s -> 17381.69s]  Yeah, gameplay on my stream. No, no, no, no, no, no, I pressed it
[17383.21s -> 17388.46s]  All right, dude
[17391.46s -> 17394.25s]  Where are you?
[17394.25s -> 17396.55s]  Behind you you gotta do another jump
[17401.83s -> 17406.95s]  Ah, you think you're so funny think about it until the very end
[17407.91s -> 17412.39s]  I could I could just I could get them. I could get them real good here. Holy shit a bear is up here
[17412.87s -> 17416.18s]  What the heck?
[17416.18s -> 17418.18s]  Nice reaction. That was a good react
[17420.60s -> 17427.83s]  One of the one of the best all-time reacts. This actually is a pretty hard spot in the regular game. Yeah in the lore the
[17428.95s -> 17440.87s]  Halberd the kind of winged knight that's up there is actually really annoying. I just got some pants for real
[17442.66s -> 17446.30s]  I'm not even joking. I've got pants
[17446.86s -> 17453.90s]  Well, that's a way easier enemy to deal with
[17466.62s -> 17468.79s]  There's a hole there if you wanted
[17469.43s -> 17471.86s]  If you need like a joke, i'm fine
[17487.08s -> 17490.73s]  Yeah, I we we probably I don't know when you want to do it but
[17491.61s -> 17496.33s]  You you are we are have we our connection together is not fantastic right now
[17496.49s -> 17499.85s]  Uh, let's end here and I can go upgrade my sword. I'll kick you out
[17499.93s -> 17505.88s]  Okay, kick me out and like i'm like reset like the game game. You know what I mean reset the game game
[17506.20s -> 17509.66s]  We set the game game
[17509.74s -> 17512.46s]  You look golden and crispy you why do you look deep fried?
[17514.89s -> 17520.14s]  You've been in a tanning booth
[17520.94s -> 17523.77s]  All right, you kicked me out, right?
[17523.77s -> 17525.53s]  Yeah, i'm gonna like
[17525.53s -> 17532.12s]  Quit and reset i'm gonna like actually restart the whole game like to desktop
[17532.84s -> 17534.44s]  I suggest you do it too
[17534.44s -> 17540.14s]  I feel like we haven't had a refresh in a little while you're calling for a full refresh
[17540.54s -> 17561.42s]  I am calling for a full refresh. Okay, i'm back dude
[17561.82s -> 17565.18s]  Um gamer mode was just fucking activated, dude
[17566.63s -> 17568.71s]  My long sword went from five to plus 14
[17570.95s -> 17572.39s]  Official gamer
[17572.39s -> 17574.63s]  Wait, I can still go further. I just don't have the souls
[17577.51s -> 17580.36s]  uh
[17580.36s -> 17581.80s]  We might have a problem
[17581.80s -> 17589.80s]  What's the problem? I can't open the game anymore. What is what is it saying?
[17590.44s -> 17594.47s]  Because I just activated game remote. I don't know if you heard
[17595.11s -> 17600.71s]  um
[17600.71s -> 17603.27s]  Maybe time for a full reset
[17603.43s -> 17604.55s]  Yeah
[17604.55s -> 17613.99s]  Well, let me do this again and make sure this is not going to be a problem. Okay, we're okay
[17616.60s -> 17618.60s]  Oh, thank god. All right for a second
[17619.43s -> 17625.03s]  I got like a hard crash with like the with the red stop sign and the white x in the middle and it was like
[17625.03s -> 17636.71s]  Blah blah blah blah a bunch of bullshit. I was like this is bad. So we're good. Did you do a uh reset?
[17638.62s -> 17639.58s]  Yeah
[17639.58s -> 17648.74s]  He's you're lying. I you know, you didn't okay doing a full reset. I got my I got my sword to plus 16 germo
[17649.62s -> 17651.62s]  I'm very excited to use it
[17651.70s -> 17653.70s]  Um, i'm gonna do a raid with you
[17654.90s -> 17657.30s]  Yeah, like like a wow raid not like a
[17658.10s -> 17661.27s]  twitch raid
[17661.27s -> 17665.48s]  People make fun of me for doing wow references. I hope they do it to you too
[17666.04s -> 17670.84s]  I have I I don't know anything about wow. I was doing that for you. Oh, okay. Thanks
[17673.61s -> 17677.93s]  Uh, I am gonna go back to oh, yeah. Remember you need to launch with the the dot back
[17677.93s -> 17692.87s]  Yeah, that's why you were getting errors. Uh, I think I did it right. So we're going to the rampart tower, right? I am ready
[17693.51s -> 17697.35s]  Hopefully a full reset will fix the teleporting problem because you were kind of just
[17698.06s -> 17703.42s]  I want to say every 30 seconds or so every every enemy and you would freeze and then 10 five seconds later
[17703.42s -> 17716.92s]  It'd be like everything would just kind of catch up. Hope this fixes it. So how are you how you feel?
[17717.48s -> 17719.32s]  Are you good? How do I feel? I feel great
[17719.32s -> 17724.28s]  I feel like i'm like i'm at the top of my class like i'm getting straight a's but I just put down my uh
[17724.60s -> 17728.44s]  My thing you can join i'm talking about like playing this and streaming this you you're good to go
[17728.52s -> 17732.92s]  Keep going right i'm i'm I just got the plus 16. All right, I want to hit some things with my new sword
[17733.00s -> 17739.16s]  I'm i'm i'm down to stay here for a little while too. This was just checking in
[17739.40s -> 17757.02s]  I just want to hit something with my sword. We're good. Let's go. Oh my god
[17757.34s -> 17762.09s]  I think I know about that too. I'm the one that came up with that
[17763.35s -> 17777.16s]  You actually are the originator. You don't think I know that skip. This is a good guy over here
[17778.17s -> 17781.75s]  Hey, hey you isn't this a really scary big like bird enemy?
[17782.47s -> 17784.34s]  Yeah
[17784.34s -> 17806.07s]  The awful like we made this game, but we also didn't want you to enjoy it bird enemy dude. Look at this damage
[17808.44s -> 17810.60s]  What's so is that just a regular? Oh my god
[17811.40s -> 17813.40s]  That actually was a lot
[17813.40s -> 17815.32s]  How much was that?
[17815.32s -> 17817.32s]  Uh, it was 570
[17818.33s -> 17820.10s]  What?
[17820.10s -> 17824.84s]  Oh, I definitely have to put that on
[17824.92s -> 17827.26s]  All right. That's perfect
[17827.26s -> 17833.94s]  Don't worry stand behind me. I've never even seen this. Does this have any attributes on it?
[17838.63s -> 17842.33s]  No, it's goofy
[17843.21s -> 17873.93s]  Insane drip you're looking fresh. I look like i'm belong in a katamari game. Nice line. Nice line
[17874.01s -> 17875.61s]  There's been a lot of bugs
[17875.61s -> 17877.61s]  But you have like an antecedent
[17878.02s -> 17884.42s]  One shot. All right. Now we definitely are going to be able to beat this whole game, right? Like if that's the case
[17884.50s -> 17897.69s]  I ascend it. This is glint stone pebble people you just killed that I hate him
[17906.26s -> 17913.27s]  Watch out dragons ahead
[17913.27s -> 17915.27s]  flag
[17915.59s -> 17918.31s]  In my first playthrough, I was looking at my menu and that
[17919.13s -> 17922.09s]  Swept down like that and I thought it was a dragon tail and I screamed
[17922.57s -> 17925.61s]  That's pretty crazy. I've never noticed it
[17933.74s -> 17939.34s]  Oh shit, we got a bow boy. Keep it down. That actually is one of the harder ones, isn't it?
[17939.82s -> 17949.46s]  Honestly, you should just
[17949.54s -> 17952.62s]  You're doing 600 plus damage. Yeah
[17957.91s -> 17960.71s]  Oh my goodness. I'm so glad I didn't get hit by that
[17961.59s -> 17973.69s]  I thought I had another weapon in my other hand
[17975.22s -> 17977.22s]  Whirl. Oh flame
[17981.91s -> 17984.09s]  Oh, he's too short. He's too short
[17984.09s -> 17990.57s]  You gotta fight him
[17990.57s -> 17992.65s]  All my swings just went over his head. I got him
[17999.67s -> 18004.73s]  Cool. This is a fun game
[18004.73s -> 18009.13s]  Should I play this game normally? I haven't this is the first time i've really played it. Is this like a yeah
[18011.82s -> 18018.55s]  Um, I actually wouldn't really recommend it alone. It's like too hard and like I don't it's not even like fun
[18018.87s -> 18024.63s]  Are there this exhausting are there this many enemies that are spawned in and stuff or is it like are they how does it work normally?
[18025.86s -> 18027.86s]  Uh, this is about the same like really
[18028.50s -> 18030.50s]  It's just the co-op thing. Yeah
[18030.74s -> 18034.74s]  Like a lot of a lot of this you're thinking that but a lot of the spawns in this game don't really make any sense
[18036.94s -> 18042.44s]  Like they put crabs next to like sorcerers and stuff. It's kind of just spam enemies. You should rest
[18043.00s -> 18048.62s]  I'm uh, i'm trying to make you remember when we played terraria together
[18049.10s -> 18051.90s]  I'm I know I remember I brought it up earlier and um
[18054.12s -> 18059.24s]  Again, everyone i'd like to apologize for like making germa play a great game and having a fun time with him
[18059.56s -> 18061.80s]  I'd like to sincerely just say i'm sorry
[18062.44s -> 18066.04s]  There was a lot of minus twos that just didn't even understand what was going on right there
[18066.28s -> 18074.06s]  For those of you that don't know stir and I played terraria together and it was me just watching him play with like a thousand mods
[18074.46s -> 18078.94s]  And i've never played terraria before and I was just like is this game like fun normally and he's like, yeah
[18079.02s -> 18092.33s]  Yeah, but like don't worry. Just come over here. Yeah, take take all these items. Nothing wrong. Just watching
[18092.41s -> 18094.89s]  All you guys are just watching. Hey, I had a good time. It was fun
[18102.50s -> 18108.92s]  I remember
[18108.92s -> 18113.72s]  It really was so funny because I remember it's half the time. I would just be like hey i'd be up in the base
[18114.60s -> 18116.60s]  And you'd be down
[18116.66s -> 18121.00s]  Adventuring somewhere just collecting ore like the one specific ore that you needed
[18122.23s -> 18123.37s]  and
[18123.37s -> 18125.37s]  whoa
[18125.37s -> 18131.29s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think that just both get a great drop. Yeah, I think that's
[18132.09s -> 18137.74s]  I got a fantastic drop doing that. Oh, it's one of those omens. Hold on
[18141.03s -> 18145.77s]  From where though? Is it an omen? No
[18148.20s -> 18152.20s]  All the way up there ignore him. Yeah, yeah that guy we killed earlier, but he respawned
[18152.68s -> 18154.68s]  Let's just get this bonfire
[18154.68s -> 18159.74s]  And then go up the other way
[18159.82s -> 18161.82s]  I think this thing is really really good
[18167.77s -> 18169.69s]  Oh my goodness
[18169.69s -> 18187.93s]  50 strength, I could almost do that. What about the int? I can respec when we do the um
[18189.56s -> 18205.86s]  Academy. Yeah, we already have the key. Yeah good for now. No me strong doesn't have intelligence
[18211.16s -> 18213.16s]  Ooh, I like that
[18213.80s -> 18215.24s]  I like your outfit
[18215.24s -> 18222.98s]  There we go. I was waiting. Okay. Yeah, that's my good drop. You're just missing the default green tunic
[18227.08s -> 18237.67s]  Well, i'm kind of like an epic bar face the glint stone pebbler
[18242.07s -> 18244.07s]  We're we're at godric. Aren't we?
[18244.78s -> 18264.44s]  Yeah, he's like right through here
[18264.44s -> 18266.44s]  magic missile magic missile
[18272.70s -> 18279.14s]  Secure that for you secure that kill but my game keeps lagging
[18284.04s -> 18286.04s]  Are you on are you on the wi-fi?
[18288.49s -> 18295.69s]  Yeah, but it's a good wi-fi router. I have like five to ten megabytes down. No. Oh the oh the giga mat
[18299.11s -> 18300.79s]  the bamco giga mat
[18300.79s -> 18304.87s]  I just don't think that I think this mod does not like um the bigger open areas
[18307.59s -> 18312.23s]  It does uh, like when we load a new zone. Sometimes it freezes and wiggles
[18312.71s -> 18318.98s]  It hasn't been that bad for me
[18319.94s -> 18324.74s]  Cool, but I don't need it
[18326.09s -> 18328.95s]  Oh, what'd you get?
[18328.95s -> 18331.02s]  mushroom arms
[18331.02s -> 18332.66s]  Oh
[18332.66s -> 18334.18s]  Can't really see him
[18334.18s -> 18336.18s]  No, i'm not on the wi-fi
[18336.42s -> 18352.98s]  It's an item over here. What is it? I am going to one shot godric
[18355.78s -> 18357.78s]  I hope you do this
[18359.51s -> 18361.51s]  Well godric is going to be a dog
[18363.26s -> 18366.38s]  Uh, we're aggroing like every single thing here
[18367.02s -> 18369.77s]  It's probably not a good idea
[18373.82s -> 18375.27s]  oh
[18375.27s -> 18390.57s]  I've run out of magics
[18391.74s -> 18393.74s]  Oh these fuckers. He almost got me
[18414.26s -> 18418.25s]  Got a larval tear I have one too. So that's awesome
[18418.97s -> 18422.57s]  Oh, okay. I thought you were looking for one. Yeah, I got one. I actually got one really early
[18423.13s -> 18424.89s]  It was like
[18424.89s -> 18428.09s]  I want to say the first like half hour we were playing first hour
[18428.89s -> 18441.14s]  Okay
[18441.14s -> 18443.94s]  Candle stand i'm getting a lot of random weapons now
[18444.66s -> 18448.17s]  Yeah, I think we're pretty set to just do content
[18458.87s -> 18466.36s]  Oh painting
[18466.36s -> 18471.98s]  Morgan's cursed sword rate mace. Is that should I use that?
[18472.78s -> 18485.22s]  Oh, yeah, some blood weapon. Fuck that. How did I just break that myself?
[18485.86s -> 18489.10s]  I don't know you can power stance then
[18491.22s -> 18501.37s]  This thing gave me three awesome items. I prefer the mace
[18511.40s -> 18512.82s]  another one
[18512.82s -> 18514.44s]  gargoyles greataxe
[18514.44s -> 18517.43s]  Another one that might be better than what I have right now
[18518.55s -> 18530.95s]  Have you have you plus one a single weapon? Yeah, i'm holding right now. You should do a weld
[18531.43s -> 18549.03s]  You want me to do a weld do a weld huge weapons. I think dual welding is
[18549.77s -> 18558.60s]  Definitely dangerous, especially if you don't have a mask for it if you want you do jump attacks. They're really strong
[18563.64s -> 18565.64s]  Oh my god, that seems amazing
[18567.77s -> 18573.08s]  I'm actually gonna do this for a minute. Oh
[18574.17s -> 18576.30s]  Little gross boy
[18576.30s -> 18583.62s]  Didn't even see that until it started moving. Oh, we got one of like I hate these enemies
[18584.10s -> 18587.14s]  Oh, there's been a lot of I hate these enemies thrown out there today
[18588.60s -> 18590.70s]  This is a real
[18590.70s -> 18593.98s]  One takes the cake. Uh, this is bad. This is actually not good
[18594.95s -> 18600.71s]  This is gonna be harder than the boss it probably right now and i'm getting killed by a fucking one singular gargoyle
[18603.40s -> 18605.16s]  Good luck
[18605.16s -> 18607.16s]  I love this slap
[18607.72s -> 18624.06s]  Oh my fucker fucking fucks. What the fuck? What was that? I think it was one of the enemies
[18627.72s -> 18629.50s]  Are you okay?
[18629.50s -> 18638.52s]  Yeah, i'm good. Yeah, watch out. There's like this one gargoyle up there. You're not gonna want to fight that guy
[18639.16s -> 18641.30s]  Okay
[18641.30s -> 18643.86s]  It might have even been this one. He's killing me again
[18644.74s -> 18653.35s]  Oh shit with the dog
[18653.35s -> 18657.03s]  Here a whimper i'm doing all strength and endurance and i'm gonna do dual weld
[18669.64s -> 18674.28s]  This he's sitting up on this stupid fence post thing and I can't hit him fight the other stuff
[18680.73s -> 18684.33s]  Dude, this is a shit show of an uh, and this is this is
[18685.66s -> 18687.66s]  I don't think we can walk by here
[18687.98s -> 18692.94s]  I don't need to you don't run up there. Don't start hitting the things sitting on the spike
[18694.46s -> 18696.73s]  We got a dual weld
[18696.73s -> 18702.70s]  Okay, hold on minus five thousand souls, by the way, what do you mean me or who me?
[18704.20s -> 18708.66s]  I'm still alive still. Okay, kill this girl girl
[18714.34s -> 18715.62s]  one at a time
[18715.62s -> 18720.79s]  Okay, I can magic bolt the the ass sitter
[18721.91s -> 18730.97s]  And I don't know what is shooting that like giant blob of poison. I have no idea
[18733.19s -> 18735.19s]  This other thing the guy with the crown
[18737.05s -> 18739.05s]  I don't think we can fight this
[18739.98s -> 18741.82s]  We can it's just
[18741.82s -> 18747.46s]  We gotta like one v one and not be like perma staggered when he comes out here or two v one
[18747.94s -> 18750.74s]  Because i'm always fighting some other shit while you're fighting it
[18751.30s -> 18768.01s]  Oh, it's him doing that
[18768.17s -> 18772.17s]  Oh my god, look at the surface area. The surface area is insane
[18784.76s -> 18793.67s]  And it made me realize there's a good item back here. Well, uh, I don't want to reset this but i'm poisoned
[18793.67s -> 18796.23s]  Hopefully how long do not we're good
[18807.56s -> 18809.16s]  there
[18809.16s -> 18810.12s]  You are
[18810.20s -> 18835.80s]  Okay, bye
[18835.80s -> 18838.44s]  You good. Oh, you got the finger. I got the finger
[18844.30s -> 18848.39s]  Well, I think I know what?
[18848.71s -> 18857.99s]  Has to happen now, right?
[18857.99s -> 18860.79s]  I I don't know what needs to happen. This is the weapon i'm using
[18862.42s -> 18865.86s]  All right. I mean i'm pretty settled in what I got. I'm i'm comfortable
[18871.11s -> 18874.20s]  Can I do a well, um, it didn't look like I could swing both
[18880.02s -> 18885.38s]  Is it like a joke that how you pronounce that is that like a running gag or is it real? What do you mean?
[18886.12s -> 18890.28s]  Dual weld dual welding dual will do wielding
[18890.84s -> 18900.52s]  do welding
[18900.52s -> 18901.48s]  Bam
[18901.48s -> 18902.84s]  Did I kill it?
[18902.84s -> 18905.08s]  Yeah
[18905.08s -> 18907.24s]  Dual wheel dual wielding
[18910.20s -> 18915.00s]  You almost sound like when you say it that way that you're trying to do like the ubu duo wielding
[18919.02s -> 18921.27s]  This is what it sucks
[18921.27s -> 18924.31s]  The finger this thing's dumb. It didn't even hurt anything
[18925.11s -> 18927.74s]  Actually, it's kind of good. Never mind
[18927.82s -> 18930.30s]  Okay, changed your tune pretty quick there buddy. Do
[18931.74s -> 18933.02s]  Welding
[18933.02s -> 18934.70s]  Duo wounding
[18934.70s -> 18936.15s]  All right. Are we ready?
[18936.15s -> 18941.51s]  Uh, no, let's go up the stairs the other direction and and get those items and just look what's up there
[18941.83s -> 18948.52s]  Do a wee bit of a rest
[18948.52s -> 18953.42s]  Uh, let me put a point into what do you think strength? Of course wait endurance
[18953.74s -> 18967.58s]  I love how this greatly increases your maximum fp and it is
[18968.84s -> 18971.13s]  as much
[18971.13s -> 18973.13s]  I don't think they can even cast one spill
[18973.37s -> 18980.47s]  It's because it's percent based
[18980.47s -> 18996.41s]  Yeah
[18996.89s -> 19000.39s]  It's really not I need to like upgrade it
[19002.65s -> 19005.13s]  Upgrading things is pretty good
[19016.58s -> 19020.42s]  You know, what's really actually good about this is you don't get staggered if you take damage while you do it
[19026.23s -> 19038.06s]  Oh, is it one of those those are really good. It seems pretty good. Okay, where did you go?
[19038.54s -> 19044.38s]  Bro, are you on the wi-fi? I went back down to the bonfire. Oh and I rest it
[19045.10s -> 19053.64s]  oh
[19053.64s -> 19061.37s]  All right
[19061.37s -> 19068.41s]  I don't look funny enough. Can you can you step up your comedy right now?
[19068.57s -> 19074.70s]  I haven't laughed in like an hour. I know like what the fuck dude. I think this is pretty good actually
[19077.24s -> 19080.17s]  I you feel like I like your face
[19081.88s -> 19084.28s]  I miss my face. I only wore this for you
[19084.92s -> 19089.35s]  Do you want it? I'm not going you think i'm gonna try to
[19089.99s -> 19094.63s]  Pretend to be one of the most celebrated people on planet earth. No, there's only one bar
[19094.63s -> 19096.63s]  I'm actually kind of offended that you did that
[19096.87s -> 19098.07s]  Did what?
[19098.07s -> 19102.55s]  You know, nobody can be barf drinker besides barf drinker. Okay. Well, i'm no longer barf drinker
[19102.55s -> 19106.55s]  I apologize. I thought you'd think it was like funny and we'd have like a ha you're barf. Sorry
[19107.29s -> 19109.46s]  I don't I didn't see what it was
[19109.46s -> 19113.54s]  Uh, are we skipping or we uh, we uh story watchers. We are
[19116.70s -> 19119.26s]  Skipping skipping
[19119.26s -> 19127.19s]  Can't skip it. Oh, it's god free the grafted. Oh shit
[19128.46s -> 19131.82s]  This might not be that bad though. This was one of the dumber ones
[19137.78s -> 19140.02s]  Oh my god, dude, just stand there and cast
[19140.66s -> 19142.02s]  glint stone
[19142.02s -> 19143.54s]  glint stone
[19143.54s -> 19145.38s]  glint stone
[19145.38s -> 19147.46s]  glintstone pebble
[19147.46s -> 19150.81s]  i'm out
[19150.81s -> 19153.62s]  Shit
[19153.62s -> 19163.80s]  I'm gonna die
[19167.54s -> 19169.54s]  All right, I gotta stop using the comedy move
[19173.83s -> 19175.62s]  See stop
[19175.62s -> 19178.10s]  What he's actually teleporting that's what i'm saying
[19184.30s -> 19186.70s]  Finger him. Wait, wait, wait. Let me get the last hit
[19187.26s -> 19194.86s]  Finger him. What the fuck dude? What what what?
[19195.42s -> 19199.21s]  What I got four golden seeds
[19201.42s -> 19203.26s]  What are you kidding me?
[19203.26s -> 19206.86s]  What did you get? I got a heater shield and
[19207.96s -> 19211.32s]  I didn't I didn't even care. It was so I didn't even I didn't even
[19211.88s -> 19216.28s]  You got well, at least you got cool stuff
[19216.28s -> 19220.92s]  Yeah, I don't know if I would be betting against us right now. He has an absolutely jacked up
[19221.56s -> 19227.30s]  Glint stone. Why are you doing that much damage? I don't understand. How are you doing that? Um
[19228.10s -> 19230.10s]  Because it is a weapon art
[19230.18s -> 19236.90s]  It's not the actual spell and then the weapon art spells are tied to the upgrade level of your weapon and my weapons plus 16
[19237.54s -> 19239.54s]  magic glint stone pebble sword
[19240.17s -> 19260.01s]  Jesus like if it was an actual glint stone pebble spell it wouldn't be doing that much. Okay
[19260.41s -> 19262.65s]  Let's uh, let's go find some bosses. Hold on
[19263.45s -> 19266.97s]  I can level up one more time
[19267.53s -> 19274.26s]  I got 20 vigor. I I can do um, just dumping the strength now. I think that's the plan
[19278.78s -> 19285.10s]  Plus 10 finger would be sick. Maybe i'll do it. Uh, do you need any smithing stones?
[19285.18s -> 19288.30s]  I I have quite a lot of sombers you'll probably get you up to like a
[19288.86s -> 19292.30s]  Does this use? Uh, yeah, what does this use? Is it somber or is it regular?
[19297.00s -> 19302.55s]  I don't know. This thing's kind of a piece of shit though
[19304.02s -> 19308.34s]  Strength d dex d and 20. I mean 50. I mean this thing kind of sucks
[19308.66s -> 19320.47s]  I know i'm so indecisive. I have to pick something usually again
[19320.63s -> 19327.67s]  I think we actually switch personalities because usually this would be me I picked up a default long sword and was like that's that's the one
[19327.99s -> 19337.59s]  What about this thing though?
[19337.59s -> 19342.71s]  I expected that if we played together you'd be using a whip. So this is uh an upgrade really
[19343.51s -> 19347.61s]  Yeah, okay
[19347.61s -> 19352.25s]  I will keep the finger for a comedy weapon, but i'm going to probably upgrade the ruins great sword
[19352.41s -> 19363.48s]  I think that's the plan. Okay in the meantime, let me put the actual thing that I had. Yeah, it's just for now
[19363.88s -> 19383.46s]  Nobody here sitting sitting that no one's here sitting the chair. Oh my god. Don't don't get out of that chair
[19383.86s -> 19391.24s]  You haven't earned it. I did sit in it. You lagged because you're on a fucking 28k modem. I'm on a 45 180
[19391.78s -> 19419.98s]  Forget where you go here. Okay, you still haven't landed
[19420.70s -> 19423.50s]  He's okay. That was funny. I got my rivers of blood
[19424.38s -> 19430.50s]  But i'm more of a default long sword kind of guy
[19433.99s -> 19437.35s]  It's weird. I mean, I I know I know you pretty well at this point
[19437.75s -> 19443.70s]  But it is kind of interesting that we're playing randomizer and you're like, yeah, i'll take just the regular long sword
[19445.08s -> 19448.79s]  I haven't really found anything else that like made sense
[19448.87s -> 19458.55s]  I did want to be a spellcaster. We haven't found anything. I got a crystal spear, but they kind of suck man
[19458.55s -> 19462.17s]  There is I I didn't want to over complicate it even more
[19462.17s -> 19466.73s]  But I think there's an option in the randomizer that when you find an item it also has like a random ash of war
[19467.13s -> 19468.89s]  and they can be um
[19468.89s -> 19474.57s]  Get like some really weird combination items. This is the guy that
[19475.85s -> 19482.14s]  I I know I have to tell you like you this is that guy, right? I yes it is you say so
[19487.61s -> 19490.81s]  Give me some runes, please donate 10 runes. Sure
[19490.81s -> 19493.11s]  Yes
[19493.99s -> 19506.47s]  Oh ancient death rancor kill him take a path to the graveyard
[19508.81s -> 19510.97s]  I just realized that this is not the outfit he's supposed to have on
[19526.78s -> 19537.96s]  Bubble people I think we can just go straight to uh ray lucaria because we have the keys
[19538.68s -> 19541.75s]  Yeah, we do
[19541.75s -> 19547.08s]  Pretty far away though. No, you like go down this hill and then you're out into the lake
[19561.29s -> 19564.68s]  Hmm. What's on your food?
[19564.92s -> 19566.92s]  Uh radar what what should I get?
[19567.48s -> 19573.46s]  What should I do what's on my food radar for your radar? Yeah, like what what are you thinking?
[19574.90s -> 19576.90s]  What am I thinking that you should eat?
[19577.94s -> 19579.94s]  Not necessarily. Yeah
[19579.94s -> 19581.91s]  now
[19581.91s -> 19583.91s]  Well, if you don't want to hear it
[19584.94s -> 19587.82s]  You I don't know lasagna. I that's that's not
[19588.70s -> 19592.14s]  Oh, hey mcdonald's or like a pizza or like making
[19592.94s -> 19594.94s]  I'm not gonna make a fucking lasagna
[19595.74s -> 19597.93s]  Not right now
[19598.57s -> 19600.71s]  Actually
[19600.71s -> 19603.82s]  That sounds pretty good
[19603.82s -> 19606.25s]  That's a that takes a lot of time
[19606.25s -> 19608.25s]  It does it takes a very long time
[19609.46s -> 19612.26s]  Uh, you're gonna let's just you're gonna keep riding kill this thing
[19612.90s -> 19617.82s]  I'm not killing it
[19617.82s -> 19623.02s]  So were you gonna upgrade that because again like I I might actually have all the way to plus 10 somber smithing stones
[19623.26s -> 19625.26s]  Maybe I haven't decided yet
[19626.28s -> 19628.28s]  But I somebody said you can't drop
[19628.68s -> 19631.02s]  stones
[19631.02s -> 19633.02s]  Really? I don't know if they're lying enough
[19643.48s -> 19647.40s]  You can't apparently you cannot drop, uh smithing stones on the ground
[19647.88s -> 19651.53s]  Although this is not in the right spot now it is
[19656.74s -> 19658.74s]  I'll just keep them for when I find something
[19658.82s -> 19662.90s]  This is my favorite part of the randomizer so far is opening up these merchant loot boxes
[19669.74s -> 19671.90s]  It's got a lantern for me. Thank god. Yeah
[19672.54s -> 19674.14s]  But I can't afford it
[19674.14s -> 19678.49s]  I think stone one i'll take it
[19678.49s -> 19686.20s]  Uh glenstone craftsman's cookbook. Do you want this? Well, the cookbooks I think are also random
[19686.76s -> 19697.53s]  Why is this so expensive?
[19697.53s -> 19704.81s]  Actually, that's something we probably should have been checking. I forget how the cooking even works. Wait a minute
[19704.89s -> 19712.33s]  This is I can buy this is an unlimited amount of these boiled crab. I can buy
[19713.13s -> 19731.00s]  It's about 20 of them. Um, okay. I'm gonna mark this because
[19731.64s -> 19738.20s]  you know the boiled crab boiled crab boiled crab
[19739.08s -> 19740.66s]  is
[19740.66s -> 19743.30s]  Uh greatly boost physical damage negation for a time
[19743.94s -> 19746.82s]  These are apparently really really hard to come by
[19747.38s -> 19751.75s]  And they're 250 and i'm i'm gonna buy like 500 of them. Sounds like cheating
[19753.78s -> 19756.65s]  It is
[19756.65s -> 19766.41s]  I guess I'd take the bell, right? Okay. All right. Um, where to um straight to lucaria
[19767.35s -> 19770.30s]  The pokemon I think that's his name
[19774.12s -> 19782.36s]  Isn't there a uh a map um, um, he's hitting me he's hitting me even stop hitting me. I can't help you
[19783.24s -> 19784.44s]  I'm fine
[19784.44s -> 19787.58s]  I still don't have a plus one to my flask
[19793.72s -> 19797.29s]  What happened? That was really weird. Okay. I'm all right
[19813.70s -> 19816.95s]  The bonfire
[19818.89s -> 19822.49s]  Yeah, this one's fake. This one's actually fake. This one doesn't work. This one's not real
[19822.65s -> 19826.89s]  They should have added mimic graces that yeah, they like attack you and shit
[19829.94s -> 19835.70s]  Isn't um this this portal if you go in here teleports you all the way up to the door. There's a different one
[19837.78s -> 19839.78s]  I don't remember. Oh legendary
[19840.50s -> 19843.35s]  lord armor
[19843.35s -> 19845.35s]  Yeah travel go in there
[19845.59s -> 19846.39s]  Yeah
[19846.39s -> 19866.34s]  Oh god, where are we going? He doesn't even talk to me anymore
[19868.26s -> 19873.46s]  What did you go on the portal? Yep. Okay
[19887.67s -> 19889.67s]  Man i'm getting the good good stuff
[19893.13s -> 19896.52s]  I'm gonna be elden lord
[19896.60s -> 19900.44s]  You probably are and it's annoying because look at how cool you look and how much powerful you are than me
[19900.76s -> 19905.64s]  We kind of match now. How do I not have a key didn't we both? Oh wait, maybe we I can't use it
[19905.64s -> 19907.64s]  Maybe we bought the fake one
[19907.64s -> 19911.10s]  Because there's there's two keys do I need one too
[19912.14s -> 19916.86s]  No, but there's two lucaria keys one that you give to the guy for a quest and one that you use for yourself
[19917.02s -> 19919.18s]  It's the fucking not. Yeah
[19920.22s -> 19921.98s]  It's the one that he gets
[19921.98s -> 19925.34s]  Okay, and maybe uh, maybe we can go where the dragon is and see if that
[19925.90s -> 19928.54s]  Oh that actually might be a much easier boss
[19929.91s -> 19934.54s]  Yeah, we're jumping off. Uh, be careful. I've died here. I died here probably 30 times
[19935.51s -> 19939.35s]  Okay, well i'll watch you go first. Yeah, you're gonna die dude. Holy shit. That's where you do it
[19942.97s -> 19949.22s]  See trust me. Maybe art. I died so many times jumping off of that edge
[19950.20s -> 19956.44s]  Just being ridiculed and laughed at by everybody watching for days. I just had a flashback
[19957.53s -> 19965.00s]  I remember watching your initial elden ring playthrough in the area near here at the castle church where you have to find the three turtles
[19966.78s -> 19972.34s]  It was the closest i've ever come to just ending it all. Where's the dragon?
[19974.57s -> 19984.17s]  But also I agree. I fucking hate that place. Isn't the dragon right here? Uh
[19985.56s -> 19990.90s]  I don't know. I thought the dragon distracted everything looks the same. I think it's up a bit further
[19991.91s -> 20000.80s]  Is it further up? Oh spinning stone?
[20002.14s -> 20007.42s]  Uh, there's there's a something boss enemy out here. Where are you? Oh shit. We lost each other
[20008.14s -> 20010.15s]  We're good
[20010.15s -> 20012.55s]  Yeah, I would avoid the the super slug boss
[20014.22s -> 20016.22s]  What is that? Is that a oh, it's a tree spirit
[20018.52s -> 20022.52s]  Is that just a regular enemy or is that supposed to be the dragon because the the key is behind the dragon?
[20022.92s -> 20024.44s]  That's a regular enemy
[20024.44s -> 20026.44s]  The dragon's in like the alcove
[20031.80s -> 20034.07s]  dude, he is
[20034.07s -> 20036.15s]  Moving his hips in all sorts of ways
[20036.79s -> 20038.79s]  He is just
[20041.64s -> 20045.48s]  He's so he won't leave he won't stop his aggro range is insane
[20046.20s -> 20049.77s]  Do you want to kill him? Let's do it. Let's teach him a lesson
[20066.44s -> 20068.44s]  Okay
[20068.44s -> 20072.79s]  Um, let's find the dragon. We actually demolished him
[20073.43s -> 20078.09s]  Yeah, let me look at the map. Oh, I didn't get wait. I thought I picked up the map
[20079.13s -> 20087.26s]  Come on snail shoot that ballista. That's okay. I love that. I'm gonna shoot his blister and I'm gonna get them
[20088.65s -> 20090.97s]  Oh, no, wait, I don't have any hands. How am I supposed to do this?
[20092.07s -> 20094.95s]  Don't kill him. He's a character. I made he's he's like a I gave him a voice
[20094.95s -> 20100.87s]  That means he's he gets to live you were the one hitting him. I didn't mean to yeah, let's go
[20106.01s -> 20108.01s]  Uh, I think we're on the wrong side
[20110.98s -> 20114.76s]  um
[20114.76s -> 20117.96s]  We're gonna go like up here like this way, right? Yeah, it's up here
[20121.80s -> 20126.18s]  Pfft
[20126.18s -> 20129.06s]  We're gonna soft lock our game if you give one of the bosses a voice
[20130.74s -> 20131.70s]  Uh-oh
[20131.70s -> 20133.94s]  So don't do that. Isn't it right up here?
[20141.34s -> 20143.02s]  Where where is it?
[20143.02s -> 20145.70s]  We need the map in this direction
[20152.06s -> 20154.06s]  Get out of the way. Yeah, it's up here
[20154.62s -> 20163.37s]  All right. What is it? I hope it's
[20164.20s -> 20166.04s]  I hope it's really easy
[20166.04s -> 20168.04s]  Oh, wait, I think I saw
[20168.58s -> 20171.70s]  Oh, it was a dragon. It's a dragon. What?
[20172.50s -> 20180.79s]  But then it wasn't a dragon but now it is a dragon wait, why is it it's a dragon it's a different dragon lame
[20183.51s -> 20184.71s]  Wait, it's not
[20184.71s -> 20186.71s]  It's not a dragon
[20190.79s -> 20194.95s]  That was the fucking scariest thing i've ever seen in my life that was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me
[20195.59s -> 20202.39s]  It was like a 3d movie dude was coming out of the screen my like chest hurts. It actually was a 3d movie. Oh my god
[20205.70s -> 20208.46s]  I guess it was a dragon
[20209.58s -> 20215.24s]  Shit
[20215.24s -> 20217.24s]  Uh, are there two of them now?
[20217.90s -> 20219.58s]  No, I think it's just the one
[20219.58s -> 20239.24s]  Oh, he hurt his ankle
[20239.24s -> 20240.86s]  Watch out
[20240.86s -> 20242.86s]  He's gonna breathe the fire
[20243.90s -> 20252.86s]  This was not a glint stone dragon
[20253.75s -> 20255.75s]  He has a fucking billion health
[20260.44s -> 20263.40s]  I think this is the starting area first dragon you would normally fight
[20266.31s -> 20270.60s]  Why wouldn't gonna despawn?
[20271.08s -> 20274.71s]  No, it's not
[20274.71s -> 20276.71s]  Why you gotta be so negative?
[20283.90s -> 20286.58s]  And why are you not on the horse?
[20286.66s -> 20288.50s]  Are you trying to die?
[20288.50s -> 20290.90s]  I don't like fighting him on the horse
[20290.90s -> 20292.90s]  I get on the horse like when he moves
[20295.10s -> 20306.71s]  Trying to die
[20306.71s -> 20307.75s]  Hey
[20307.75s -> 20309.51s]  ready
[20309.51s -> 20310.71s]  Whack
[20310.71s -> 20326.97s]  He went way shorter than I thought
[20332.57s -> 20334.57s]  What the hell did I do that for?
[20334.81s -> 20339.37s]  It's a good thing we didn't aggro him into that like other boss enemy
[20340.65s -> 20343.37s]  No
[20343.37s -> 20344.49s]  He did
[20344.49s -> 20348.57s]  Does he get his health back? I don't think he does unless the co-op mod broke it
[20350.10s -> 20354.52s]  He does not
[20354.52s -> 20361.72s]  That can just happen
[20361.72s -> 20364.28s]  Oh my you gotta be fucking kidding me
[20364.92s -> 20366.12s]  Good luck
[20366.12s -> 20374.82s]  I've died to that enough times
[20374.82s -> 20376.82s]  Oh, I'm just gonna fly away again
[20390.36s -> 20392.36s]  Are you trying to duck behind them?
[20392.44s -> 20394.44s]  That was so funny
[20394.60s -> 20399.18s]  That should have worked and if it did you would have gotten a stamp of approval
[20400.84s -> 20403.46s]  That's so awesome
[20404.42s -> 20407.54s]  It was actually worth a try. You're right. Come on
[20416.49s -> 20418.49s]  Every cartoon i've ever watched
[20419.13s -> 20423.11s]  Means that should have worked
[20423.11s -> 20438.50s]  That's gonna get me isn't it?
[20438.50s -> 20447.59s]  He needs to stop
[20447.67s -> 20458.44s]  Glintstone dragon agil. Yeah, i'm gonna get hit he took one damage
[20459.16s -> 20461.16s]  I think it's because I was mid jump
[20469.74s -> 20471.10s]  Agil
[20471.10s -> 20471.90s]  Oh
[20471.90s -> 20472.94s]  Agil
[20472.94s -> 20475.16s]  Agil
[20475.16s -> 20476.68s]  Oh my god
[20476.68s -> 20478.68s]  He just just just
[20479.14s -> 20480.68s]  Lacerated your throat
[20480.68s -> 20482.49s]  Who's it?
[20482.49s -> 20486.81s]  Yeah, I would have had the health if this game allowed for rp and I could have hid behind that stump
[20489.74s -> 20495.46s]  That's too bad that that didn't work aim for the head genius. It's i'm not playing
[20495.94s -> 20497.94s]  We were spectating him playing
[20500.42s -> 20502.62s]  That wasn't me
[20502.62s -> 20505.82s]  Wait, are you talking about me? But I am a genius. Thank you
[20509.96s -> 20512.25s]  Okay, so
[20512.25s -> 20515.93s]  The key was behind him and I got more like golden seeds. There's a lot of good items behind him
[20516.57s -> 20518.57s]  Let's do that at least get the key
[20519.30s -> 20520.82s]  Don't hit his legs
[20520.82s -> 20527.05s]  Hey, I play my game the way you you play yours, you know, you play you know what I mean?
[20527.05s -> 20532.55s]  I'll play my game the way I want
[20532.55s -> 20535.03s]  Oh, it is the first dragon. That's why it's doing the intro
[20544.46s -> 20546.63s]  Oh agil
[20547.11s -> 20548.47s]  Agil
[20548.47s -> 20583.51s]  I don't know if people know this but his head's actually up in the air and it's not on the ground at all times. You can't
[20584.31s -> 20586.54s]  Always hit his head
[20586.54s -> 20588.54s]  Because it's raised above the ground
[20591.11s -> 20593.11s]  A lot of the time well, you don't know anything
[20630.73s -> 20667.72s]  What did you just do to my fucking best friend trying to get him right in the face that move sucks that move sucks bad
[20674.14s -> 20675.58s]  uh
[20675.58s -> 20679.02s]  Coward
[20679.02s -> 20682.22s]  Coward before me
[20682.22s -> 20687.08s]  Is that a world of warcraft reference?
[20688.36s -> 20694.04s]  Is that what Illidan says?
[20694.04s -> 20696.36s]  That was not as deep as I wanted it to be
[20697.66s -> 20699.66s]  I let me try that one more time
[20700.73s -> 20705.85s]  Coward before me way better and a thousand times better than the first one
[20707.11s -> 20709.51s]  That is not that was what you were supposed to hear
[20710.15s -> 20712.15s]  But instead you heard something else
[20713.02s -> 20717.02s]  Okay, what is it? What's the reference old timer? I don't know. It was an orc
[20719.99s -> 20721.59s]  But it is world of warcraft
[20721.59s -> 20725.48s]  maybe
[20725.48s -> 20731.62s]  I I don't
[20735.29s -> 20739.05s]  The first one was the first one was cookie monster
[20745.96s -> 20747.96s]  What the hell was that move?
[20748.44s -> 20749.56s]  Oh god
[20749.56s -> 20757.18s]  We're almost got it almost got it almost got it
[20761.11s -> 20763.11s]  There's something in my face
[20769.85s -> 20773.85s]  Don't breathe fire this way don't breathe don't breathe fire this way. That's the slam
[20781.72s -> 20787.91s]  Oh, that was a good hit
[20787.91s -> 20791.75s]  I knew he was I was fucking greedy. I was like i'm just gonna hit him the one time
[20792.39s -> 20794.39s]  And germa's also gonna be dealing damage
[20795.19s -> 20797.19s]  There's no way he's gonna get another attack off
[20797.91s -> 20807.42s]  Hey noticed uh
[20807.42s -> 20812.10s]  You were kind of like looking at me and my buddy over here. I think you like fucking such hot shit
[20814.02s -> 20816.02s]  Thanks for help fighting the dragon
[20817.53s -> 20824.14s]  Dick
[20824.14s -> 20825.50s]  I did nothing
[20825.50s -> 20827.93s]  He's watched
[20827.93s -> 20830.12s]  That that's
[20830.12s -> 20832.14s]  the dragon trainer
[20832.14s -> 20834.39s]  Dude, that was his dragon
[20834.39s -> 20839.03s]  And why wouldn't he be over here going like no, what have you done to my dragon?
[20839.67s -> 20844.52s]  because he's actually
[20844.52s -> 20845.96s]  kind of relieved
[20845.96s -> 20847.96s]  Because his dad was a dragon trainer
[20848.52s -> 20850.52s]  And he didn't really ever want the job
[20851.74s -> 20853.74s]  But there's someone's gotta take care of it
[20855.59s -> 20857.59s]  How many of you guys here like hate my guts?
[20861.05s -> 20863.05s]  Why what?
[20863.45s -> 20866.01s]  I keep doing like these like stupid voices
[20867.77s -> 20872.70s]  All right, where we going i'm dead right now
[20872.70s -> 20878.62s]  So I need a rest you're kind of in control of the whole the whole situation and you're just killing the mana
[20879.34s -> 20882.92s]  dumb beetle
[20882.92s -> 20890.10s]  Do you need more mana? No, we're ready to do it dude. I can't vote i'm fucking dead
[20892.79s -> 20894.79s]  So I have to run all the way back here
[20894.79s -> 20897.03s]  I guess it's so far
[20899.00s -> 20901.32s]  If we're saying there was the lb, there's no lb
[20901.88s -> 20905.80s]  Oh, you have to run all the way over there. Oh, come on guys
[20908.73s -> 20911.13s]  It's not even a good impression of me I would have laughed if it was good
[20912.63s -> 20915.11s]  It wasn't you you think everything's about you
[20915.67s -> 20918.15s]  That way that wasn't you doing what I was just doing
[20918.73s -> 20921.53s]  It was me doing what you were doing, but it wasn't me being you
[20921.85s -> 20926.25s]  Okay, let's go up to lucario now that we have the actual key. I'm very confused of what you just said
[20926.49s -> 20946.31s]  Let's do it. What's this pole?
[20959.05s -> 20961.56s]  I walked in the castle already
[20961.56s -> 20965.24s]  Why would you do that now? I don't even have control of the character. I turned into an npc
[20966.60s -> 20974.02s]  Yeah, I might have fucked things up really think through you stop rushing. What the hell. How big is that hand back there?
[20975.29s -> 20977.29s]  There's a hand that big in this game
[20978.58s -> 20979.94s]  You've never seen that
[20979.94s -> 20981.94s]  No, it's a secret boss
[20982.02s -> 20988.90s]  I actually do mean that it actually is like a secret boss funny thing a tidbit about this actual secret boss in the game. It drops
[20989.46s -> 20995.61s]  Nothing. There's no reason to kill it. It doesn't do anything normally. Um,
[20996.41s -> 20999.53s]  I it's in there's like a some overpass where it's kind of hanging
[20999.77s -> 21004.33s]  It doesn't it's it's like a useless enemy to kill. I forget where it is
[21005.18s -> 21007.02s]  It's like a narrow
[21007.02s -> 21009.34s]  Place and it's like an overpass and it drops down in the mountains
[21009.42s -> 21015.80s]  Yeah, I remember when it when I finding it was like holy shit. Oh my god and then killing it
[21015.80s -> 21026.23s]  It was it didn't not even like a butterfly nothing. It has no loot table. Wow, stand up fix your posture for god's sakes
[21027.59s -> 21042.98s]  I'm tired 19 percent of you are hate watching me right now. Oh shit
[21044.98s -> 21050.68s]  Say something say something that they'll hate. No, I don't want to do that. That's what they're here for
[21050.84s -> 21054.84s]  How could it be only 19? That sounds pretty that sounds pretty low
[21055.48s -> 21059.90s]  Oh god
[21063.99s -> 21075.51s]  This guy has a lot of help I got you I got you. Oh you okay. What?
[21076.60s -> 21080.76s]  I think you're underestimating how strong this guy is. He's pretty strong. I don't see
[21084.01s -> 21091.16s]  He's pretty strong
[21093.93s -> 21099.66s]  Oh, what the fuck I was trying to match it I came like lagged
[21101.03s -> 21116.90s]  Where are you? I died. I'm coming back. Oh, oh you didn't like spectate. No, I just did didn't give me the option to
[21117.30s -> 21119.93s]  Okay. Am I waiting for you?
[21120.81s -> 21127.22s]  You have an e-buff. Oh, whatever. We'll be fine. He has like 700 damage glen stone. We're fine
[21127.78s -> 21136.73s]  It's like a bonfire up here
[21136.73s -> 21140.73s]  Seeing this place for the first time from the outside was awesome. This guy had me huge blood-borne vibes
[21151.99s -> 21156.55s]  Okay, I think I am I am now the decent like are you some weird shit?
[21157.43s -> 21160.57s]  Okay, what's in here seems better now?
[21161.43s -> 21162.71s]  um
[21162.71s -> 21168.23s]  This is a classic run through this room and pretend it doesn't exist. I don't even care what the enemies are. Okay
[21169.96s -> 21185.51s]  and let's rest
[21186.07s -> 21190.68s]  Oh, why do you still have 18 000 viewers? I don't know
[21191.48s -> 21195.40s]  Yeah, I think I think I did leave like 17 000 souls at the dragon boss
[21195.88s -> 21200.12s]  It gave it to me after I died so I thought I would respond with them because the weird co-op stuff
[21200.92s -> 21204.81s]  I think I gotta go back
[21205.59s -> 21209.19s]  Yeah, I got we gotta go. I gotta go pick this. Yeah, they're gonna go pick this up
[21209.51s -> 21213.59s]  Yeah, there were 18 000 souls in the ground. That's you had that that's a lot
[21214.31s -> 21216.47s]  Yeah, it's a lot. So i'm voting
[21217.27s -> 21219.43s]  I'm asking kindly once again if we're
[21220.47s -> 21227.00s]  to the temple quarter, um
[21227.56s -> 21229.56s]  Where is that just south of us?
[21230.04s -> 21238.65s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh I see what you mean. I didn't I I thought for a second
[21238.65s -> 21245.22s]  I thought you're talking about the dragon area. Oh, yeah the dragon area. I don't know why this is called like temple
[21245.30s -> 21266.55s]  There's no temple you got what you needed
[21267.61s -> 21272.09s]  Yeah, let me go back to uh
[21273.74s -> 21295.88s]  Church of the cuckoo. Are you insecure right now? No, i'm just chilling. I'm having fun. Don't worry about me. I'm good
[21296.44s -> 21302.23s]  What do you what would you be insecure about the cookie monster voice that I did like 10 minutes ago? Oh
[21304.54s -> 21309.34s]  You did do a you did do a pretty weird marge like three hours ago as well. That was actually good though
[21309.50s -> 21311.32s]  That's the difference
[21311.32s -> 21313.32s]  I don't care if a voice if a voice sucks
[21313.72s -> 21318.04s]  And it's stupid and it's like cringy that a human would do it in front of like a stadium full of people
[21318.70s -> 21320.70s]  That's fine. As long as it was good
[21321.48s -> 21323.48s]  You cannot go back and tell me wait
[21323.80s -> 21325.00s]  what
[21325.00s -> 21329.48s]  Is it like I don't know by definition if it was cringy then it also wasn't good. No
[21330.44s -> 21333.32s]  It was it was an almost flawless marge simpson
[21334.12s -> 21336.44s]  But that was like kind of cringy to do that. Don't you think?
[21338.22s -> 21339.50s]  Uh, no
[21339.50s -> 21341.50s]  Oh, all right, then there's no argument here
[21342.22s -> 21345.02s]  Yeah, i'm just gonna let that guy we're just gonna like oh it's mambo
[21345.82s -> 21348.38s]  Yeah, mambo number five
[21348.38s -> 21371.75s]  Everybody loves mambo. I thought that was a giant sheep. I'm tanking it. I'm tanking it. I'm tanking it
[21373.34s -> 21374.38s]  um
[21374.38s -> 21377.19s]  Will you one of us is falling off this?
[21377.91s -> 21380.47s]  I'm tanking this i'm tanking that was so sad
[21383.78s -> 21385.78s]  Thank you. I'm tanking it. I'm tanking it
[21386.18s -> 21392.18s]  I'm taking it out mambo
[21399.83s -> 21401.99s]  I hate I don't want to kill mambo, but we kind of have to
[21402.55s -> 21405.50s]  Why is ever why why does every creature have a name?
[21406.76s -> 21408.12s]  uh
[21408.12s -> 21409.56s]  when you played
[21409.56s -> 21411.56s]  Through the first time what did you use for a spirit summon?
[21415.40s -> 21418.46s]  mimic tier
[21418.46s -> 21420.46s]  Yes, I ruined my first playthrough
[21421.18s -> 21423.70s]  that's oh
[21423.70s -> 21427.06s]  Look, it's not that that's not a big deal
[21427.22s -> 21430.26s]  I didn't use the spirit summon all game until I found that and then my chat was like
[21431.06s -> 21432.26s]  I was like what?
[21432.26s -> 21439.54s]  I watched my mimic tier kill morgot without me even playing the game and then I kind of felt like oh, this is not
[21440.63s -> 21444.23s]  I remember do you guys remember that it was like wow morgot. Oh my god
[21444.23s -> 21450.31s]  This is so epic and he just killed him without even playing and it felt really I was like, oh, I didn't even really do anything
[21452.36s -> 21453.24s]  I
[21453.24s -> 21456.60s]  I can't remember there was like one boss that I let my mimic tier fight on their own
[21457.32s -> 21460.76s]  And I was like, I don't even feel bad about that. I didn't feel like fighting this boss
[21461.56s -> 21467.72s]  Well, the reason why I say that is because the snake that enemy we just fought is what is going on
[21467.80s -> 21472.60s]  What is this guy doing? It's super frozen. Do you think i'm getting what you were talking about before?
[21477.13s -> 21482.17s]  Uh, I upgraded that snake that with the fire whip to plus 10. That's what I used the whole game
[21484.28s -> 21486.20s]  His name was mambo
[21486.20s -> 21489.00s]  I also ignored I completely ignored the mechanic
[21491.64s -> 21496.54s]  That's a big bird
[21496.54s -> 21498.54s]  What would you say is uh?
[21501.26s -> 21503.66s]  Did you hate elden beast like everybody else did
[21505.46s -> 21506.42s]  um
[21506.42s -> 21513.46s]  Kind of yeah, I don't know this very many people that oh my god. Okay. Hold on. This thing could kill us both
[21518.92s -> 21521.08s]  Uh, this thing has so much health
[21522.63s -> 21524.63s]  I think we just run. Yeah, we have to run I think
[21527.75s -> 21537.08s]  Don't go over there. What use the you can't move
[21537.96s -> 21539.96s]  Oh my god
[21545.78s -> 21550.50s]  Help i'm just i'm going across the bridge man. I don't want to sing you i'm asking god
[21551.14s -> 21556.39s]  get shit
[21556.39s -> 21558.87s]  I'm telling you just come across the bridge. We don't have to fucking kill this thing
[21559.67s -> 21561.67s]  Oh, okay. All right. All right
[21575.02s -> 21577.40s]  I'm fine
[21577.40s -> 21582.62s]  This is so stressful
[21582.62s -> 21585.74s]  Why is this guy disappearing with magic? Did you see what what?
[21586.38s -> 21587.90s]  I didn't see
[21587.90s -> 21589.90s]  Where did this come from help?
[21611.11s -> 21613.83s]  Are you still alive?
[21613.83s -> 21619.13s]  Yeah, how did you live through that I don't understand I I stood back and watched nothing aggro'd to me
[21623.80s -> 21625.80s]  Uh, but what are you doing?
[21626.84s -> 21631.38s]  Uh, should I rest?
[21631.38s -> 21634.33s]  Wait, where's the bonfire? Oh, do you want me to reset it?
[21636.38s -> 21638.26s]  uh
[21638.26s -> 21642.42s]  Sure, I think we need to do like a legit reset because it's desyncing a lot. I
[21642.98s -> 21648.74s]  Don't close the game yet because my I have 20 000 souls that are on the ground out there
[21649.30s -> 21651.30s]  Oh, okay
[21652.10s -> 21658.26s]  All right, all right this guy this guy is fucking crazy man. Well, just ignore just ignore him. Okay. All right
[21671.83s -> 21676.31s]  Oh, it's the teleporting glintstone guys. Is that what you meant? He actually teleports
[21681.11s -> 21683.51s]  Oh gosh, do I am I gonna get those?
[21684.79s -> 21685.99s]  Here you

[21691.27s -> 21693.59s]  There's still dude. There's still an angry dude down here
[21699.53s -> 21702.41s]  Okay, I am now ready to sever the connection
[21704.09s -> 21706.09s]  We got let's get the next bonfire
[21709.00s -> 21711.00s]  Uh, okay. I'm gonna follow your lead
[21711.48s -> 21716.12s]  Okay
[21716.12s -> 21718.12s]  Yeah, we're desyncing so hard
[21718.70s -> 21720.70s]  Watch it. We're gonna just jump and run
[21739.27s -> 21740.79s]  my god
[21740.79s -> 21746.98s]  Don't drop those souls. I'm not i'm holding them
[21752.82s -> 21754.97s]  Excuse me
[21754.97s -> 21756.97s]  What don't you what's happening? Okay
[21758.76s -> 21765.08s]  Sir, I need you to communicate with me clearly. Why would you am I should I go up there with you? Yeah, that's where my next bonfire is
[21769.00s -> 21789.64s]  Don't follow me. Did you forget everything? No, I I remember but he's just moving so fast. He's moving too quickly
[21790.20s -> 21793.80s]  Oh, sorry. I'll slow down. I'll wear some heavy armor
[21795.02s -> 21804.36s]  All right. So do you want to actually do like a reset? Yeah, I'm gonna do like a quit the main menu and we'll restart
[21804.44s -> 21807.08s]  You know, I don't think we need to restart the whole game. No, I don't think so
[21810.36s -> 21812.36s]  Like I have to banish you
[21813.48s -> 21815.48s]  Yeah, leave us alone
[21816.12s -> 21818.95s]  What is doing that?
[21818.95s -> 21821.74s]  And then I banished you
[21821.74s -> 21823.58s]  I hope you spent your souls
[21823.58s -> 21827.10s]  I did but I um, am I gonna get those back?
[21827.58s -> 21836.17s]  This eighty six hundred they're gonna be right here, right? Yeah. Sure. Yeah, they're okay. We're good
[21836.81s -> 21850.84s]  You look like you're in a painting
[21850.84s -> 21871.14s]  Cool. I am ready whenever you are in fact
[21871.22s -> 21873.78s]  I'm just gonna get out of the way because this thing's gonna keep doing that isn't it?
[21873.86s -> 21878.42s]  Yeah, I put my thing down. I'm gonna try and kill it in the real world, which is my world
[21879.54s -> 21887.35s]  Do something funny. I'm falling asleep
[21888.92s -> 21892.44s]  Did you just not see the the insanity of the last five minutes
[21893.08s -> 21897.64s]  Maybe if you're falling asleep, you should go to sleep and actually get a good tonight. Good night. Good night. Rest
[21898.60s -> 21902.20s]  I feel like I feel like we screamed at least five or six times each
[21907.00s -> 21909.00s]  What why are you asleep?
[21909.32s -> 21924.04s]  I'm really used to the screaming by now. So it's not that big of a deal
[21924.84s -> 21926.84s]  Don't do that though
[21926.84s -> 21928.84s]  Oh, that was the wake-up call
[21928.92s -> 21931.72s]  Get in here. There's a chest back here. You're running away wrong way
[21932.36s -> 21934.60s]  You're kind of just freaking out dude. I'm fine
[21935.80s -> 21942.50s]  Don't you want the sick loot? Sure. I got immutable shield
[21943.99s -> 21948.07s]  A little bit of witchcraft the first stone sword key. I found the whole game pretty cool
[21948.63s -> 21951.16s]  And you get the chest
[21951.16s -> 21955.32s]  This chest right there. Yeah
[21955.32s -> 21956.68s]  golden rune
[21956.68s -> 21977.53s]  Pretty cool. Have a pizza
[21978.33s -> 21980.33s]  party
[21990.06s -> 21994.14s]  Have a piece I could go for a pizza
[21994.94s -> 22000.50s]  Hmm somber ancient dragon smoothing stone. We actually just did that
[22004.30s -> 22008.22s]  There's a lot of hidden walls here well
[22009.45s -> 22011.05s]  now
[22011.05s -> 22019.21s]  The game really begins because I just got horror loser remembrance. This is like a hundred thousand souls. Nice find. That's a good find
[22019.77s -> 22026.52s]  That's a pretty good find. That's also a good find but it's faith, isn't it?
[22027.32s -> 22030.10s]  Stupid bubble thing
[22030.10s -> 22032.10s]  But that's just not good
[22036.42s -> 22038.31s]  Get the axe
[22038.31s -> 22040.89s]  Get the axe get the axe don't do the remembrance
[22047.43s -> 22051.26s]  Is the axe good? I don't remember it. I feel like the weapon art was kind of lame on it
[22052.22s -> 22060.47s]  Maybe it scales really well
[22062.02s -> 22064.10s]  All right, it's this one here, right
[22064.10s -> 22066.10s]  It's the one that has no books, right?
[22070.81s -> 22075.05s]  I don't know. I think this is another one of those things that maybe only ever did one time. Yeah, it's over
[22075.77s -> 22077.21s]  This place is wacky
[22077.21s -> 22080.90s]  It's like three or four ways to go in secret walls
[22084.02s -> 22089.94s]  Ooh, I think that's all right
[22089.94s -> 22096.34s]  Then come over here the items you get from the boss souls are also randomized. Oh, that's all right
[22096.34s -> 22098.66s]  Well, i'm just gonna break it then just put strength true
[22099.14s -> 22108.36s]  Okay, cool. And by the way, um
[22109.54s -> 22112.26s]  Interesting to note nothing up here, but uh jump over here
[22113.29s -> 22117.69s]  Take a look at that
[22117.69s -> 22118.65s]  Mm-hmm
[22118.65s -> 22123.74s]  And I think there's another thing we can do here any secrets in here. Uh, no down another one
[22124.47s -> 22130.38s]  Any secrets in here? Yes. Whoa
[22131.59s -> 22133.59s]  Oh, you were actually fighting something. Mm-hmm
[22137.21s -> 22141.93s]  This is the big thing here and I think this is one of the best scaling staff in the game, right?
[22142.65s -> 22144.65s]  Um, there's one of those witches in here
[22148.58s -> 22152.26s]  This thing actually is gonna this thing hurts a lot from what I remember
[22152.90s -> 22158.95s]  It's got one eight feet
[22158.95s -> 22160.95s]  Yeah, i've never come down here. Really?
[22161.59s -> 22163.03s]  I think I remember
[22163.03s -> 22167.67s]  Trying to find this one. So I don't think I uh, I did the whole floor thing that you just did
[22167.83s -> 22171.91s]  I think I found the first secret door. That's also really good the magma sword
[22172.31s -> 22173.43s]  It's faith
[22173.43s -> 22180.23s]  Sure, maybe I should do faith. I don't know but this thing is the the sword. Yeah
[22181.46s -> 22185.45s]  That thing is really good
[22185.45s -> 22192.90s]  I get to be the magma worm
[22192.90s -> 22196.10s]  I have a lot of souls to lose. So let's beat her first try
[22198.58s -> 22200.58s]  This is going to be a really easy boss
[22204.97s -> 22206.97s]  How is this going to work with the bubble stuff?
[22211.69s -> 22215.53s]  What it's not that's not him this isn't a
[22216.49s -> 22219.61s]  This is an imposter why is he wearing this default?
[22221.83s -> 22223.83s]  He's just he's just a guy
[22224.63s -> 22227.99s]  He's in like a ray of lucaria with like the stone helmet thing
[22229.45s -> 22231.45s]  He's just a normal guy
[22237.69s -> 22241.53s]  Oh, no, this is where this is not. Um, this is the dog
[22245.69s -> 22253.59s]  Usually yeah
[22253.59s -> 22254.79s]  He healed
[22254.79s -> 22255.99s]  He cheated
[22255.99s -> 22258.84s]  Next time him
[22258.84s -> 22267.42s]  Oh be careful my friend
[22267.58s -> 22272.06s]  And nothing left in that flask
[22282.30s -> 22287.64s]  Okay, we got him
[22287.64s -> 22289.90s]  Gideon off near of radigan
[22293.16s -> 22295.16s]  He couldn't pick a character either I don't know
[22297.18s -> 22313.61s]  What everything I guess i'll be sir gideon off near of radigan the brave the wise actually
[22322.07s -> 22331.19s]  Yeah, do I go full on just absolute insane mode here? What is absolute insane mode?
[22331.19s -> 22337.72s]  Could you break that down for people who are unfamiliar? It is me doing the horror loot remembrance and getting like 120 000 souls
[22338.52s -> 22341.56s]  You should go super hard here
[22341.56s -> 22343.16s]  No mercy
[22343.16s -> 22344.81s]  That's it
[22344.81s -> 22351.70s]  Wait, I thought it was way more than that. Isn't that one of the last bosses in the whole game?
[22353.78s -> 22358.01s]  Yeah, I thought it was like 100k. How much how much did you get 30k?
[22360.26s -> 22366.76s]  That might be scaled then is it scaled? Okay. Well because yeah, here should be like 80
[22369.24s -> 22370.68s]  It's 80k
[22370.68s -> 22373.22s]  For elden 30k though. All right, whatever
[22378.41s -> 22383.53s]  What a useless amount of knowledge that i've held in the back of my brain for like a year to be like yeah
[22383.61s -> 22385.94s]  I think horror lose is 80 000
[22386.50s -> 22389.14s]  And apparently be right and I use this
[22389.94s -> 22399.03s]  This thing is crazy
[22399.03s -> 22408.71s]  Oh, you got the fucking sexy girl hat. Yep. Sorry. I have it. She's not even real
[22411.80s -> 22414.92s]  It's starting to look more and more like the character. I actually played the game with
[22415.48s -> 22431.08s]  Oh, is the ball still here? I wonder if the ball is something else. I challenge you to combat. It's an interesting group
[22464.10s -> 22466.10s]  Now i'm now i'm fucking
[22467.26s -> 22469.50s]  Stand back. I've got the new fall season
[22471.19s -> 22481.06s]  um
[22481.06s -> 22483.54s]  Will you this is wait, this is a sheep here
[22485.02s -> 22487.98s]  Yeah, usually I think there's like bunny rabbits, but the the normal
[22488.62s -> 22490.62s]  Enemies are replaced
[22491.83s -> 22496.95s]  You know what i'm saying, you know, you know, like i'm not gonna finish the sentence. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. It's an arm
[22497.51s -> 22503.08s]  troll knight sword
[22503.08s -> 22505.70s]  I like that weapon
[22506.10s -> 22508.10s]  But I probably don't have the strength to use it
[22508.26s -> 22516.97s]  Probably not. So do you want to go walk around and get all the wacky shit here or do you want to just kill?
[22517.45s -> 22519.45s]  Uh ray lucario and get out of here
[22520.34s -> 22522.36s]  um
[22522.36s -> 22524.36s]  This area is so big. I just want to kill
[22524.76s -> 22526.44s]  uh lucario
[22526.44s -> 22534.39s]  Do you want to check back here real quick? It's just a sprint. Why is one of those usually a bunch of items?
[22535.11s -> 22544.78s]  The mosquito is biting me
[22544.78s -> 22546.78s]  Oh shit, I got the sacramental bud
[22548.92s -> 22550.92s]  I got regular club
[22551.00s -> 22554.47s]  Anything else back here?
[22554.47s -> 22556.97s]  Uh, there's one item around the back
[22557.37s -> 22559.93s]  And we got a a tree over here
[22561.62s -> 22565.54s]  stop
[22565.54s -> 22567.54s]  a little bit of a ritual pot
[22583.13s -> 22585.13s]  Oh, I thought there could only be one barf. Oh
[22585.69s -> 22587.13s]  What happened to that?
[22587.13s -> 22589.13s]  I just wanted to see what it looked like
[22589.21s -> 22590.01s]  Okay
[22590.01s -> 22602.17s]  I'm putting on this thing again
[22603.50s -> 22606.78s]  Yeah
[22606.78s -> 22608.30s]  Okay, i'm just going
[22608.30s -> 22610.54s]  You're a fraud
[22610.54s -> 22612.86s]  me
[22612.86s -> 22616.54s]  No, i'm just gonna come out of nowhere and call me a fraud
[22616.94s -> 22618.94s]  You're a fraud. You know that
[22620.33s -> 22622.49s]  Well, i've got an epic loot here. I gotta get that one
[22624.66s -> 22626.66s]  um
[22629.30s -> 22631.06s]  Thank god I wasn't
[22631.06s -> 22639.56s]  Okay, the ball's still here. What does starlight shards even do? I forget which way it goes at the end
[22640.81s -> 22641.85s]  same
[22641.85s -> 22654.06s]  Mm-hmm. I've never gone down that way. I died. Why can I see everything?
[22655.66s -> 22667.53s]  Uh, oh because you reset it. You want to wait for you?
[22668.55s -> 22670.30s]  Yeah
[22670.30s -> 22687.98s]  Be careful
[22687.98s -> 22690.78s]  I I have to go down to the bottom. There's an item dude
[22691.42s -> 22692.94s]  It's a purple
[22692.94s -> 22699.58s]  I thought that was gonna kill you
[22699.58s -> 22701.66s]  me too
[22701.74s -> 22703.74s]  The the guy with the hat
[22713.99s -> 22715.99s]  Where does this teleporter take you? I forget
[22716.82s -> 22723.42s]  Um, I also forget
[22724.06s -> 22728.54s]  What do you mean you forgot? This is it's not like this is like a 200 hour game with
[22729.32s -> 22732.86s]  Thousands of locations and and and potentially millions of different things to see
[22733.90s -> 22737.98s]  It might take you inside volcano near the volcano manor. I think so
[22742.28s -> 22747.48s]  Or I think that one takes you somewhere stupid but there is one in like those locked rooms that takes you to
[22747.88s -> 22750.68s]  There we have like a car we have literally I actually have a comedy guy
[22752.55s -> 22759.55s]  He doesn't have a weapon. He just has the shield the weapon is a shield weapon. No, wait, he's he's got pyromancy
[22762.38s -> 22764.38s]  Killing me with comedy
[22764.70s -> 22773.86s]  Oh my god, that hurt a lot
[22773.86s -> 22782.23s]  Where did this person come from?
[22782.23s -> 22787.13s]  I don't know. Why don't you ask them? I got moon veil
[22788.18s -> 22790.01s]  I used that for a while
[22790.01s -> 22795.71s]  Uh, i've actually never used it. I would be curious to try it. It's really fun because i'm intelligent
[22796.59s -> 22802.03s]  You can uh, let's just make sure we don't get jumped on here. This is one of those awful enemies, isn't it?
[22803.23s -> 22804.11s]  No
[22804.11s -> 22809.04s]  It was one of the sad pathetic losers
[22814.08s -> 22818.64s]  Uh, everybody is gonna hate you for using it because it's like it was like the broken meta weapon
[22818.64s -> 22821.12s]  But it's actually very fun to use the weapon arts are awesome
[22821.76s -> 22828.04s]  I really like do like the crescent moon slash thingy. Yeah, i'm not gonna use it unless I can upgrade it but
[22828.60s -> 22832.81s]  I'll keep it in mind
[22832.81s -> 22837.85s]  I mean hasn't this game have like a whole bunch of balance passes. Is it still like oh you gotta get moon veil
[22839.50s -> 22841.50s]  I think they nerfed it, but
[22841.82s -> 22845.23s]  It doesn't matter
[22845.23s -> 22847.23s]  I'm really low on uh healing
[22847.55s -> 22849.55s]  For this this is a good idea. Should we?
[22850.27s -> 22851.71s]  I mean
[22851.71s -> 22854.27s]  We don't know what boss it even is I keep like we get here and it's like oh, yeah
[22854.27s -> 22856.27s]  You gotta get ready for the I don't uh
[22857.15s -> 22861.26s]  This is where the game we're not gonna be able to beat this. Do you see what's up there?
[22861.96s -> 22865.56s]  No, I didn't you didn't see what was up there. I didn't see I didn't see
[22866.20s -> 22868.20s]  This is actually impossible
[22869.24s -> 22871.24s]  Good luck
[22871.56s -> 22873.56s]  This room is so small
[22876.52s -> 22882.00s]  Doesn't he do a foot?
[22882.00s -> 22884.96s]  Yeah, he fills the whole room dude. This is this is not going to be possible
[22887.26s -> 22889.26s]  This is not completable
[22895.77s -> 22897.77s]  All right, we're gonna have to figure out
[22899.58s -> 22903.66s]  We're just gonna need to scale so much we can kill him like yeah, yes him. Yep
[22907.08s -> 22910.20s]  We actually might be okay as long as it doesn't do that more than like four or five times
[22911.00s -> 22922.49s]  I have no healing so next one i'm dead. Oh boy
[22928.32s -> 22930.00s]  How did you not die?
[22930.00s -> 22935.37s]  I don't know
[22935.37s -> 22939.69s]  Hey
[22939.69s -> 22944.17s]  There's a lot of the optional shit like this where you had to do a lot like go through some weird amount of effort
[22944.25s -> 22947.53s]  To fight this boss. Yeah, I also another one. I never fought him
[22949.16s -> 22953.24s]  I feel like you missed a pretty large amount of the optional stuff in the game
[22956.14s -> 22958.94s]  The game's just that fucking big though. I really didn't
[22960.24s -> 22962.32s]  I keep saying. Oh, yeah, I never seen this but like
[22963.12s -> 22969.92s]  What do you want from me?
[22969.92s -> 22972.03s]  Who what?
[22972.03s -> 22974.03s]  You lagged on my screen
[22974.03s -> 22976.11s]  He like jumped backwards and his hand
[22977.07s -> 22979.07s]  Sliding me backwards hurt me
[22979.23s -> 22981.31s]  interesting thought from somebody in chat though is
[22982.32s -> 22991.08s]  This is phase one. We have to fight a different boss after this. I think i'm pretty sure that's not sure
[22993.95s -> 22999.82s]  There was an option in the randomizer for multi-phase bosses to like switch creatures between phases
[23003.05s -> 23008.01s]  Uh, hey, i'm i'm for it. Do you want to go again? It wasn't that bad. No, it wasn't that bad, but I
[23008.97s -> 23013.69s]  Um, can I can you I need to do more damage that big explosion because we can't avoid it
[23013.69s -> 23015.90s]  but maybe if you get like a
[23015.90s -> 23021.76s]  lightning resist shield I have
[23023.31s -> 23024.51s]  Uh
[23024.51s -> 23028.76s]  I have the crucible shield but it's gonna be so heavy. I don't think this even work
[23029.71s -> 23031.95s]  I can drop a shield for you with 34 lightning is
[23032.51s -> 23039.58s]  Like this thing says more. Okay, then i've i've just got a little baby light shields
[23042.72s -> 23044.24s]  Yeah, we can try that
[23044.24s -> 23047.36s]  He didn't have a lot of health and he doesn't that boss normally like
[23048.24s -> 23050.24s]  Teleport around in the sky
[23050.24s -> 23052.48s]  We might get in trouble there. We'll see
[23053.66s -> 23054.70s]  Uh
[23054.70s -> 23057.90s]  The one issue is I feel like i'm not doing very much damage with this. I need to upgrade it
[23059.85s -> 23066.73s]  Whatever. Fuck it. Let's go. We could uh quickly before we do the boss go to eg
[23067.29s -> 23071.21s]  And unlock that blacksmith like we've been talking about because we can just ride the horse straight up there now
[23071.45s -> 23081.37s]  Let's try it one or two more times. This is uh, this is one of the fun walkbacks. Yes it is
[23082.09s -> 23086.43s]  One of the most one of the most walkbacks of all dark souls
[23088.88s -> 23092.01s]  And we should probably get rid of the the bowl
[23092.73s -> 23101.71s]  I called it a bowl and i'm mad. We should probably get rid of the bowl. Oh the the bowl are you're teleporting around
[23104.03s -> 23106.51s]  Wait, okay. That was not fucking fair
[23107.15s -> 23108.83s]  That was not fair
[23108.83s -> 23135.56s]  That was not fair. I'm gonna die to random enemies. I just reset them. Yeah, forget where you even go to destroy the bowl
[23136.12s -> 23138.24s]  You gotta go up
[23138.32s -> 23146.67s]  Is uh outside this ladder I think it's actually out where that border is
[23147.58s -> 23151.82s]  I also think there's a shortcut on this side so you don't have to go that way, but it's still pretty long
[23159.63s -> 23169.95s]  There go 9 000 souls wonderful. What are you fighting out here?
[23171.34s -> 23172.78s]  little baby
[23172.78s -> 23178.72s]  Yeah, i've used like half of my flasks already. Well, let's we gotta do it then we have to beat it
[23180.38s -> 23192.20s]  I'm down to three
[23192.20s -> 23196.72s]  Okay, more like placid who sucks
[23214.67s -> 23216.67s]  Oh my goodness
[23216.67s -> 23238.67s]  Are you gonna do it? I'm so paranoid
[23249.28s -> 23257.45s]  Is it okay actually was not that bad if you if you tank it with the shield?
[23257.93s -> 23271.64s]  Yeah, that was pretty good. What's wrong with him? Uh, he's staggered. I'm stunning stabbing his face
[23274.09s -> 23280.83s]  face stabbed
[23280.83s -> 23282.43s]  um
[23282.43s -> 23288.49s]  What are you doing to teleport? Yeah, is this where he does the flying thing?
[23295.58s -> 23299.74s]  Oh my god, he's in the walls dude, this is gonna be impossible
[23301.52s -> 23303.52s]  He's in he goes in the walls
[23314.67s -> 23317.95s]  You're still yeah, your damage is really bad. It's terrible
[23318.67s -> 23327.60s]  How upgraded is that weapon plus one man? It's things a piece of fucking shit. This thing's a piece of shit
[23328.99s -> 23330.99s]  Upgrade a weapon
[23331.07s -> 23333.07s]  I am plus 16
[23333.63s -> 23336.88s]  What?
[23336.88s -> 23340.58s]  Hold on saying you what you're plus 16
[23341.76s -> 23346.88s]  Yes, how did you do that? How did you not hear me saying this two hours ago?
[23347.84s -> 23354.56s]  Like four or five times you're a plus 16 on you i'm plus one i'm plus
[23356.08s -> 23358.40s]  How do you have that many things? Wait a minute
[23359.21s -> 23367.85s]  Upgrade it only costs one per upgrade right back
[23368.57s -> 23372.17s]  That's why I wanted to go to the blacksmith. Don't go to the round table
[23373.93s -> 23383.29s]  We teleport to uh
[23383.29s -> 23388.60s]  Temple quarter again, and then we just got to go north for a while. That was shocking
[23389.24s -> 23392.84s]  I'm shocked that you're at plus 16. I don't know why it's shocking
[23393.40s -> 23408.89s]  I am shocked. I'm shocked to learn how little you listen to me. He said it like 50 times
[23409.29s -> 23414.33s]  I thought you were talking about your glint stone thing was like super powerful somehow because of a
[23415.85s -> 23421.05s]  Some reason asked me why it was so strong and I says because my weapon is plus 16
[23421.77s -> 23424.46s]  And it's a weapon art
[23424.46s -> 23426.70s]  Oh, I you only said that once and I didn't listen to you
[23428.11s -> 23430.99s]  You asked who asked
[23432.38s -> 23434.70s]  Hey, hey who asked am I right guys?
[23436.14s -> 23438.14s]  I asked I care
[23438.94s -> 23443.02s]  A plus one weapon a face movie. No controller plugged in
[23447.61s -> 23450.41s]  That's so fucking stupid. I cannot believe that
[23450.97s -> 23454.73s]  I forgot how this works. Do we go underneath the thing like we just keep going under here
[23454.81s -> 23457.32s]  Or do we have to go up to the left for eg?
[23457.72s -> 23463.53s]  The thing is I was like so indecisive that I wouldn't oh, I don't want to upgrade that because I don't know. I'm not sure
[23466.64s -> 23477.95s]  Up up into the left
[23478.35s -> 23483.93s]  up and to the left a little bit of a bonfire here for any bonfire enjoyers coming up on our
[23484.49s -> 23486.65s]  Left-hand side if you look out the passenger side window
[23486.81s -> 23488.65s]  Well, but to be really fair though
[23488.65s -> 23493.85s]  You did go from like doing nothing to like millions of damage like 30 minutes ago 40 minutes
[23493.93s -> 23498.25s]  Yeah, because I got very excited and I told you I went from plus five to plus 16
[23498.49s -> 23501.61s]  So it's not like this has been going on for the last six and a half hours
[23502.01s -> 23508.65s]  This is just you know, like 30 40 minutes ago you got omega juiced up you got absolutely juiced up this happened
[23509.29s -> 23520.17s]  Like shortly after market before we did the castle it is
[23520.99s -> 23525.39s]  Yeah, because after we beat market there was a whole bunch of smithing stones on the floor for me in the front of the castle
[23525.79s -> 23527.79s]  You got absolutely powered up
[23528.11s -> 23530.20s]  Really? Yeah
[23530.20s -> 23531.96s]  Well, it's not that long
[23531.96s -> 23534.68s]  Yeah, I bet you thought it would take longer for me to surpass you kid
[23535.32s -> 23539.00s]  Just wait till I get this thing to plus 16. Oh all of a sudden you're gonna be freaking out
[23539.80s -> 23541.80s]  Okay, where are we going? Because this bear hurts
[23542.81s -> 23544.81s]  Keep running north
[23544.81s -> 23546.99s]  Have you played?
[23546.99s -> 23551.63s]  You didn't know where you didn't know where we were going until chat told you five seconds ago. I knew
[23552.27s -> 23554.27s]  I figured it out. What?
[23554.35s -> 23561.23s]  It's a chest over there. Hey, remember when you want to see that
[23562.11s -> 23563.39s]  every enemy
[23563.39s -> 23565.56s]  every random ass enemy
[23565.64s -> 23571.00s]  When uh when elven ring was new after my first playthrough and there were some mods I used one that was uh, I don't know
[23571.00s -> 23572.83s]  What's hitting me?
[23572.83s -> 23576.91s]  There was one where the enemy aggro range was basically infinite
[23577.63s -> 23582.19s]  So like you'd spawn into a zone and every single enemy that has loaded in would run at you
[23584.16s -> 23585.60s]  Uh good times
[23585.60s -> 23590.62s]  This is pretty good times
[23590.62s -> 23593.98s]  So where exactly are we going from where you are right now?
[23596.94s -> 23599.05s]  um
[23599.05s -> 23600.65s]  Like from where you are currently right now
[23600.65s -> 23605.45s]  I believe you just hold left and then you go through some ruins and then eg's on the left. Okay
[23606.17s -> 23608.17s]  I feel like I already went kind of far though
[23608.41s -> 23610.41s]  You you did you have gone kind of far
[23610.89s -> 23612.89s]  I don't think I passed it though
[23613.47s -> 23616.03s]  No, yeah, I don't think you've been going that far
[23618.44s -> 23621.96s]  I definitely don't think you've passed it. Yeah. No, it's it's right up here. Yeah
[23628.70s -> 23631.07s]  Oh, you made it
[23631.07s -> 23633.76s]  What are you doing?
[23633.76s -> 23635.92s]  um
[23635.92s -> 23639.92s]  You were running in place like 100 feet in the air on my screen that whole time
[23641.34s -> 23646.27s]  I have no idea where you are. I'm just following the marker. No
[23646.83s -> 23648.83s]  Because the marker was pointing me to you in the air
[23652.94s -> 23655.42s]  Hey, there you are
[23655.50s -> 23660.92s]  You know, they took that sound from vega from uh street fighter. He makes that sound they did it first
[23661.16s -> 23662.44s]  um
[23662.44s -> 23664.44s]  I think something's wrong with my game
[23664.91s -> 23666.91s]  Okay. Well, let's just get to this thing
[23667.44s -> 23674.22s]  It's right up here friend
[23674.22s -> 23676.70s]  Can you hear the sound of my voice friend? I all right
[23676.94s -> 23681.02s]  Can you just tell me north east south or west from where we just continue going north?
[23681.26s -> 23688.84s]  This game sucks. This game sucks. This game sucks. This game sucks. Well, how did you die?
[23689.40s -> 23692.96s]  This game sucks. What did you do? What what did he do my my horse?
[23693.04s -> 23696.32s]  He didn't jump it got like stuck on a rock for a second and it didn't jump
[23703.23s -> 23710.22s]  I can't believe that grr rr martin would fucking do that. Like really man
[23711.34s -> 23713.50s]  Okay. Hi. There you are. I can finally see you now
[23716.92s -> 23722.28s]  Oh, I know where to go now. Okay. Now I I remember now you feel like it's an illusory wall. You have to hit this
[23722.36s -> 23723.72s]  Yeah
[23723.72s -> 23725.72s]  Yeah, if you're lame you hit the wall
[23726.12s -> 23731.16s]  You got my ten souls. Yeah, cool kids do it the other way
[23739.21s -> 23740.67s]  Okay
[23740.67s -> 23744.59s]  So I need to make a decision here and the decision is i'm gonna upgrade a bunch of shit
[23750.25s -> 23753.37s]  He's not here. There he is. He's he's loading in
[23758.78s -> 23760.35s]  Okay
[23760.35s -> 23771.55s]  Hi, what do I want?
[23772.01s -> 23774.33s]  Hey, by the way, just a quick question
[23775.29s -> 23776.17s]  Yeah
[23776.17s -> 23779.93s]  On my game, it is not one smithing stone to upgrade something
[23782.33s -> 23785.96s]  It I need not I need I need four
[23786.60s -> 23791.26s]  To keep going. I think you have the like cool cheat game. I don't
[23791.92s -> 23792.72s]  Oh
[23792.72s -> 23798.16s]  It was it was it's part of the randomizer and my thought because I gave you the overall seed and you copied all my stuff
[23798.16s -> 23802.48s]  That you would also have that but I think that makes sense because you actually don't have my seed
[23804.32s -> 23811.40s]  So so something happened. It's all the way wait somber. I think it's somber not regular
[23813.12s -> 23817.58s]  I think somber is always one like in in the normal game
[23817.98s -> 23824.22s]  Somber can't be plus 16. So everyone was making fun of me and it turns out that I I because I was like
[23824.22s -> 23826.38s]  Yeah, yeah somber weapons go up to plus 10
[23827.53s -> 23830.81s]  Yeah, so when I was doing the upgrades it was like, oh I need four more stones
[23830.81s -> 23834.65s]  I'm sitting here going what is people talking about? I had it right. I'm not the idiot. I
[23835.37s -> 23839.52s]  I'm looking at what I got on my screen. It wasn't my fault
[23843.36s -> 23851.29s]  So give me all your stones then wait, you can't so I need a somber weapon because we'll get
[23851.61s -> 23857.00s]  Your weapon and I can upgrade it. Oh, that's right. We can do that. Uh here do this one
[23857.16s -> 23860.62s]  I want to use this for a little while. I don't have a somber one
[23860.70s -> 23865.90s]  So if you have a plus one, I I can take yours all the way to plus seven
[23866.64s -> 23869.07s]  Okay, hold on I can do
[23872.60s -> 23874.60s]  I can take this to plus three
[23875.66s -> 23876.70s]  four
[23876.70s -> 23886.99s]  Okay, I need you can do it from five to seven, right? Yeah. Okay, wait after
[23898.40s -> 23901.20s]  No, please not the joke weapon. Well, hey take two take
[23903.05s -> 23906.89s]  No, it's fine. It's fine. I'm gonna I'll upgrade this one too. We're doing the finger
[23908.06s -> 23916.48s]  You're gonna do the finger. But yeah, i'm gonna do them both. Okay, he's gonna do the finger
[23916.72s -> 23931.53s]  I'm gonna do with them both. Is everybody really gonna be mad at me about this? I've been doing like
[23932.01s -> 23938.33s]  60 damage for the last two hours. It's gonna be better. I deleted it by accident
[23942.44s -> 23945.08s]  I need that back actually so you need to figure that out
[23950.97s -> 23955.85s]  I don't have the souls to upgrade if you have like runes you can drop. It's like a thousand per upgrade
[23956.09s -> 23963.87s]  Just give it back bro. Just give it back bro. Come on, bro
[23964.19s -> 23968.27s]  Yeah, but this is not like diablo 2. I can't drop rune. I can't drop gold on the ground
[23968.59s -> 23979.10s]  You can drop runes what right you can just discard like a stack of runes where wait, can you actually do that though?
[23980.68s -> 23984.24s]  Pretty sure yes, you can how this is like diablo
[23984.40s -> 23988.92s]  You just discard the runes just like you do with the weapon you have to do with your inventory
[23988.92s -> 24000.35s]  Not your equipment. Oh, just not not discard leave do not discard them. I need 1200 rune to get seven
[24003.80s -> 24005.80s]  Where is this?
[24005.80s -> 24015.90s]  Where is it in the item menu? I don't know this item menu was like gigantic golden runes
[24023.47s -> 24030.08s]  Oh, okay. I okay, I don't think this is gonna get you there. I didn't think you could drop those
[24030.24s -> 24033.60s]  I didn't know I didn't think you could drop those. I thought there's like a bound
[24037.76s -> 24044.36s]  That was 400. I don't think I had enough if we could sell stuff here. I could do it, but I don't think he sells
[24045.21s -> 24057.13s]  Oh, yeah, I can't I can't plus seven then that's look i'm gonna be doing
[24057.79s -> 24075.69s]  Like 500 more damage than I was before. It's fine. We're good. Give it to me. Yeah plus six is pretty big for somber
[24075.77s -> 24088.49s]  It's on the ground. It's not did you delete it? No, it's on the ground. I put it put it right here
[24089.69s -> 24094.72s]  I can still pick it up again. Okay. Hold on. Let me sit down. You can't pick it up because you upgraded it
[24095.04s -> 24102.32s]  What what do you mean now? What hold on? It's too high. What does that mean? He's not plus. What does this mean?
[24102.80s -> 24105.28s]  I got a plus one omen killer still
[24106.40s -> 24114.54s]  Fucked. Oh, okay. You can't drop that for me. We were trying to tell you we were warning you
[24114.70s -> 24120.59s]  You've never had a plus six so you can't just try to play this game with my friend
[24121.39s -> 24124.59s]  Fucking miyazaki
[24124.59s -> 24134.01s]  When can I hold this? Can I I can't do you see the item I dropped on the ground? I can see that. Yes
[24135.05s -> 24143.69s]  Okay, that's a that's a plus two. Okay, I need intelligence first. How much do I need? That's a plus three
[24146.40s -> 24155.26s]  That's a plus four. Yep. Well people were telling us we couldn't drop that shit. Wait, I thought we couldn't why is everybody making things up to us?
[24155.42s -> 24157.98s]  The only reason we did it that way
[24158.06s -> 24160.89s]  Wait, what?
[24160.89s -> 24163.20s]  Okay. All right. All right, and so
[24164.09s -> 24168.25s]  Here's a uh, here's a maybe you can't see that one. Maybe that one's too high
[24168.25s -> 24174.17s]  That one's a plus seven. I got that six, but what do I need to upgrade something else that I can actually use
[24174.81s -> 24188.78s]  I need 16 intelligence. So what is somber in my fucking inventory that I can equip dude?
[24188.86s -> 24197.50s]  We're just we're destroying the economy. Wait finger
[24198.06s -> 24200.88s]  He has the finger and I can't get it back room. All right
[24200.88s -> 24207.74s]  I'm just gonna do like the gargoyle axe or something or the omen cleaver gargoyle axe is good
[24207.74s -> 24211.63s]  Well, either those but it's regular smithing stones gargoyle
[24214.24s -> 24230.19s]  Yeah, can I hold this hold what the gargoyle? Okay, but this is not this is regular smithing stone though
[24231.96s -> 24252.04s]  I need four. I mean, please the sword will work. This i'm not sure that it will upgrade the runes great sword
[24252.20s -> 24254.28s]  Yeah, I know but I need intelligence
[24254.28s -> 24259.40s]  I can't this whole thing got fucked up because you took the fucking finger from me and I can't get it back
[24259.88s -> 24262.84s]  What they're saying is is that if you upgrade that sword
[24263.24s -> 24267.64s]  Then I can drop the finger and you'll be able to see it because you have an item that's upgraded to six
[24269.48s -> 24272.36s]  Okay, all right, so upgrade this stupid sword
[24272.84s -> 24277.00s]  What's what I need runes or or I have a bloodhounds fang
[24279.20s -> 24282.64s]  Or rivers of blood that I can give you or that you can do it to the moon veil
[24283.13s -> 24288.57s]  Because I might actually upgrade that anyway. All right, but I I have I I have I need like 15 000 souls
[24289.88s -> 24295.56s]  Okay, that should be enough I I need like 15 000 souls to upgrade this to plus seven
[24296.24s -> 24303.76s]  Oh, it's way too much. And what would you like to go do? I'm freaking out dude, dude
[24304.08s -> 24309.07s]  I I don't know. I don't have a weapon anymore. I think you only need like
[24310.01s -> 24315.16s]  6000 where you just go sell some shit. I don't know. I'm selling literally everything I fucking have
[24315.32s -> 24320.88s]  I thought I thought I just almost killed him. We just run up into that castle and kill lice. All right
[24320.96s -> 24335.63s]  Go that boss go fight this come on keep playing and save up everything. We're fine
[24336.54s -> 24339.53s]  Blame blame the
[24339.53s -> 24349.34s]  The fact that we didn't know that how how are we supposed to know that was going to happen because of the the strict
[24349.82s -> 24355.34s]  Online integrity of the elden ring game where you definitely can't just download a soul level
[24355.56s -> 24358.73s]  200 character and then play online
[24359.77s -> 24367.02s]  We can't drop shit. We didn't know we could probably kill this boss
[24367.26s -> 24377.42s]  I think we can easily demolish this boss and make it look like children. We're supposed to play this game
[24379.34s -> 24387.76s]  I actually don't do terrible damage with this. This area is also
[24388.32s -> 24398.16s]  I it might be lower level. I can't remember. Jesus. Oh carrion regal scepter
[24398.24s -> 24403.21s]  Oh, I thought that was a sword but also a captain staff this guy like extra big
[24403.45s -> 24409.66s]  I feel like they're not normally this big. Oh, you didn't find the secret extra egg boss egg bubble boss
[24409.74s -> 24416.06s]  You didn't find the bubble butt boss. Oh, looks like you don't know that his bubble butt can fucking crush your fucking jaw
[24416.70s -> 24418.70s]  Dude, i'm so fucked up right now
[24418.70s -> 24421.90s]  I'm just like, oh, there's so many emotions doing too much stimulation
[24423.98s -> 24470.19s]  There's way too much stimulation right now. First of all, get this off. So lance. All right. What do you think this? Oh my god
[24476.27s -> 24498.54s]  Nice damage, dude. Maybe you should upgrade your weapon. Oh my goodness
[24501.84s -> 24513.79s]  Oh, that was actually pretty cool. I didn't know that that was cool. All right getting there spam jump. It's heavy swings
[24514.65s -> 24518.41s]  What uh guys, uh, what do you want me to do? I need to get I I get it by any means necessary
[24519.37s -> 24522.97s]  Don't let them get to you they're they're see they're making fun of you for using something
[24522.97s -> 24525.45s]  That's actually good in the game to dissuade you from doing it
[24526.01s -> 24531.37s]  So that they can make fun of you when you do something also less efficient. It's gonna just keep happening
[24533.45s -> 24535.13s]  They're in your head, man
[24535.13s -> 24542.68s]  Sir, I haven't been live this whole time. I don't even know what you're talking about
[24544.28s -> 24548.60s]  Then who have you been talking to who's he talking to? I just i'm just having fun with my friend
[24549.24s -> 24551.92s]  I told you I didn't feel that good and I wasn't streaming today
[24556.78s -> 24560.70s]  That makes me feel worse that you weren't listening to me earlier because I know that's so much worse
[24560.94s -> 24562.94s]  That is like a thousand times worse
[24563.10s -> 24570.54s]  Now, this is what his full attention is where you're going. You're doing role play. You're doing like some some clergy
[24573.12s -> 24575.44s]  Everyone part of it. No, just pick the item that's here
[24577.45s -> 24585.58s]  Oh, wow lightning great bolts
[24585.58s -> 24587.58s]  Oh, wow, like hear ye hear ye
[24591.32s -> 24595.64s]  That but the joke was that i'm not doing a bit. I just wanted you to get the item
[24605.63s -> 24608.64s]  You'll get them you don't belong here now
[24609.28s -> 24618.33s]  Let's just run through all this
[24618.33s -> 24619.61s]  Yeah
[24619.61s -> 24622.73s]  I'm surprised. These are all actually ghost mode. I know it's weird
[24635.21s -> 24639.84s]  What what happened this fucking goblin goon?
[24640.64s -> 24645.88s]  One shot me
[24645.88s -> 24647.88s]  Just some regular dude
[24649.05s -> 24651.05s]  Oh, I think I have uh, I might have um
[24651.77s -> 24653.77s]  Here i'm resetting it. Hello
[24653.77s -> 24658.28s]  I might have had a
[24658.28s -> 24660.44s]  What uh that I might have the debuffs
[24663.02s -> 24665.02s]  Oh my god
[24665.26s -> 24667.26s]  Oh, and you had i'm just running to you
[24668.22s -> 24670.78s]  um
[24670.78s -> 24676.14s]  You just spawned everybody on me too. Yeah, that's fine because you're really powerful and you're capable
[24687.64s -> 24689.64s]  Like I just launched a nuke
[24693.16s -> 24695.16s]  The way we're even supposed to be going
[24695.88s -> 24698.06s]  I think we've dropped down. Don't we?
[24698.06s -> 24705.10s]  Do we just do we go drop down somewhere?
[24706.00s -> 24708.72s]  I don't remember. I thought you like you come out this way
[24708.72s -> 24712.00s]  Then it summons things then you go back and it opens up a different area or
[24712.88s -> 24718.72s]  I don't know. It's been a long. It's been like a year. I don't I think we actually oh, oh, but wait, wait, wait
[24719.92s -> 24724.36s]  Over here
[24724.36s -> 24727.96s]  I think that's different. That's where you get the like the super omega laser beam sword
[24728.60s -> 24733.40s]  I wonder what's here then. Oh my god. What a completely missed. What a jump
[24733.80s -> 24737.96s]  I didn't even jump forward. I did like the tiniest smallest hop i've ever seen
[24738.60s -> 24740.60s]  Yeah, that was a complete whiff
[24740.84s -> 24754.03s]  I think over here. No, I just want to go up to uh
[24755.63s -> 24758.44s]  Lycia what was that dude?
[24759.40s -> 24761.40s]  Oh my god. Okay. This is
[24763.68s -> 24765.68s]  There's a dragon over here a big one
[24768.76s -> 24773.69s]  Not a small dragon
[24773.69s -> 24776.49s]  Yeah, we just went the wrong way. There's a different path up here
[24777.21s -> 24781.96s]  This is where the sword of uh knight and flame is right? Yeah
[24787.29s -> 24789.29s]  You might need to go back to the bonfire
[24789.77s -> 24793.61s]  um, okay
[24793.69s -> 24799.37s]  Are you did you spawn or are you not spawned? I I ran up to where we should have ran already
[24802.36s -> 24803.56s]  Uh
[24803.56s -> 24811.28s]  I think i'm going the right way, aren't I? I think this is the right way. Wait, isn't this I think i'm going the right way
[24811.52s -> 24815.68s]  You're going the right way. I think i'm going the right way. No, this is i'm going the right. No, you're going the wrong way
[24815.68s -> 24817.68s]  No, i'm going the right way
[24818.01s -> 24820.57s]  I'm 100 going the right way. You're going the wrong way
[24821.37s -> 24822.89s]  You're on the wrong way
[24822.89s -> 24824.89s]  I'm in a bonfire right now. Where are you?
[24825.05s -> 24828.97s]  Like a new bonfire you haven't been to but I don't think that I can warp you here because you haven't been here
[24831.02s -> 24832.62s]  Am I not going the right way?
[24832.62s -> 24836.56s]  You're not going the right way. We don't wait because you come up this way and then
[24837.44s -> 24848.59s]  Because we were in here
[24848.59s -> 24850.59s]  And then out here
[24855.44s -> 24859.15s]  Okay, I was going the right way
[24864.83s -> 24866.43s]  Yeah, then over here
[24866.43s -> 24869.71s]  I mean I have
[24869.71s -> 24871.87s]  I was no idea where you are. I was going the right way
[24876.43s -> 24878.11s]  I don't think
[24878.11s -> 24882.68s]  That's true
[24882.68s -> 24885.00s]  Yes, I know. I'm I I promise you i'm going the right way
[24885.48s -> 24891.21s]  Do I have to like look at your stream to see what the oh you aren't you are going the right way and
[24892.41s -> 24895.05s]  I i've been telling you I was going the right way
[24895.93s -> 24899.40s]  It took a long way to get to the right way
[24900.28s -> 24913.18s]  It may have been the long way, but it was a correct way. Is there another bonfire up here? Yeah
[24913.82s -> 24921.02s]  That that fucking bowl's wearing your head down dude. It actually is I need to take it off
[24921.50s -> 24944.17s]  This is how my mom and dad argue on road trips guy showing off with his mom and dad
[24951.50s -> 24956.49s]  Cool, I got I got miniature ronnie and the finger slayer blade
[24957.63s -> 24960.56s]  Really isn't that aren't those both the same quest?
[24962.16s -> 24963.52s]  I think they are
[24963.52s -> 24971.84s]  This weapon is so dumb. It's just like that
[24972.32s -> 24979.02s]  It's like just a wall. It's like a piece of a wall. It's like the chair of a it's a leg of a chair
[24981.02s -> 24983.82s]  This is an expensive chair, which is a big big hand
[24989.68s -> 24991.68s]  Nice swing loser
[24999.29s -> 25002.25s]  Big hand is a big hand is here big hand
[25002.97s -> 25006.57s]  There's an archer big hand is more important than archer, isn't it?
[25006.65s -> 25008.89s]  What if the archer hits you and the big hand's coming for you?
[25008.97s -> 25011.85s]  Big hand is more dangerous than the archer archer. You can easily dodge
[25014.16s -> 25018.56s]  But the archer hits you and stuns you and then you get hit by the big hand. Yeah. Well if you get hit
[25020.60s -> 25022.60s]  Big bear don't go left
[25023.00s -> 25024.68s]  Which way?
[25024.68s -> 25026.68s]  This is a mobile game ad
[25027.15s -> 25031.63s]  Which way do you pick? Oh, I don't know. Maybe i'll go this way. They always pick the shittiest way
[25032.19s -> 25042.62s]  Yeah, oh I got sword dance
[25043.10s -> 25043.98s]  dance

[25049.47s -> 25055.26s]  But okay. No, I know. I think I know but I don't know that's up and the boss is literally right here
[25055.42s -> 25057.74s]  Yeah, I know but I thought there was like a shortcut you open there
[25058.30s -> 25061.64s]  Okay, you ready to fight mad soldier? I'm ready to fight. Uh
[25062.34s -> 25064.34s]  magma worm three

[25078.16s -> 25080.32s]  Oh my god, she's raining people on us
[25083.69s -> 25084.81s]  um
[25084.81s -> 25086.81s]  When do we get to fight her?
[25092.12s -> 25094.28s]  They're beating me by making me run out of stamina
[25095.10s -> 25098.14s]  all right, this actually we gotta be don't be so cocky here because
[25099.02s -> 25101.02s]  They're just dive bombing
[25101.02s -> 25104.11s]  ow
[25104.11s -> 25106.11s]  Hey, you gotta dodge that
[25106.88s -> 25108.88s]  Oh because we have to kill the ones with the
[25109.04s -> 25110.16s]  the oro
[25110.16s -> 25114.99s]  I'm sorry my bloodlust
[25114.99s -> 25120.36s]  Sorry
[25120.36s -> 25125.96s]  I love the dive the design of this fight. This is amazing. This should have been the real fight. This should have been the actual fight
[25132.99s -> 25134.99s]  Watch out for the explosive
[25136.94s -> 25138.94s]  Watch out explosives inbound
[25144.92s -> 25151.04s]  Be it right now. Here's where this gets really wacky. There's not a part two to this, right?
[25151.76s -> 25154.97s]  I have no idea
[25154.97s -> 25158.73s]  I hope not
[25158.73s -> 25160.73s]  Okay, when does she land?
[25166.49s -> 25169.79s]  No, stop it. Stop it anakin. You're killing younglings
[25175.76s -> 25179.04s]  What's going on? I don't know. I was like waiting to see if like
[25180.48s -> 25182.48s]  She's not spawning the ones we need to kill
[25182.72s -> 25184.96s]  I I think oh no, she broke right?
[25185.68s -> 25189.93s]  Yeah, she broke
[25189.93s -> 25200.01s]  There's so much shit in the way
[25200.01s -> 25204.97s]  Oh my goodness. I hope I hope I don't die here. There's no way I die this there's no way I die
[25207.53s -> 25212.84s]  It would be so shameful this book won't stop hitting me
[25215.69s -> 25217.69s]  What a shameful boss
[25218.01s -> 25253.20s]  I think her strategy is just trying to make you feel bad. I think the one we have to kill is up there
[25253.28s -> 25254.88s]  No, all right. We're good
[25254.88s -> 25256.88s]  Pray for no face too. Seriously

[25367.98s -> 25381.16s]  Oh, that's where all the pots are
[25381.16s -> 25385.88s]  Wow
[25385.88s -> 25387.88s]  And not pots this time though
[25388.44s -> 25399.77s]  Oh my god

[25423.39s -> 25424.67s]  baby
[25424.67s -> 25427.26s]  What the fuck?
[25427.26s -> 25429.26s]  sleep tight
[25429.50s -> 25447.07s]  I'm somewhat lost and confused. I thought this was something very different. We we keep going down and then you end up jumping to that thing
[25447.87s -> 25458.32s]  Okay, yeah, would he get away from me? I'm so I don't want to jump with these
[25458.96s -> 25461.18s]  He's gonna attack me
[25461.18s -> 25476.73s]  And keep going. Oh my god. It's the he turned into the boy
[25478.17s -> 25481.37s]  I didn't know I didn't care about that one. I didn't give it a voice. Oh shit. I'm getting out of here
[25481.85s -> 25491.68s]  Is that the meme?
[25491.68s -> 25493.52s]  Has he turned into a titan?
[25493.52s -> 25496.44s]  Is that what I would say if I were like funny?
[25497.08s -> 25500.78s]  What would someone funny say? You need to apologize for that
[25502.22s -> 25504.22s]  No, you need to apologize because that's
[25504.86s -> 25509.34s]  I didn't know he could do that
[25509.34s -> 25511.34s]  We came all the way this way for like one item
[25512.97s -> 25514.41s]  What is that usually?
[25514.41s -> 25516.78s]  I think that is
[25516.84s -> 25518.84s]  Usually it is um
[25519.50s -> 25523.02s]  Okay, i'm i'm i'm gonna die if I go down there so i'm not going to
[25523.58s -> 25527.34s]  Okay, let's um, let's I can't teleport because this fucking titan over here
[25528.14s -> 25532.94s]  Won't stop. Yeah. Well, there's like a chimera fighting me now like we really shouldn't have done that
[25533.10s -> 25535.10s]  I don't know why if all I do should have just left
[25535.58s -> 25543.96s]  I really was hoping we could like go to different areas
[25544.84s -> 25547.16s]  I think we can I think you can just go somewhere else
[25548.12s -> 25551.80s]  I mean whenever we waypoint travel here i'm resetting so we can travel. Yeah
[25552.44s -> 25559.55s]  Where do you want to go? Oh you wanted to go upgrade. Yes, I do
[25560.40s -> 25563.26s]  That would be nice
[25563.26s -> 25566.06s]  Leave aaron in 2021. We need a new meme funeral
[25567.40s -> 25569.08s]  Oh, I forgot about that
[25569.08s -> 25572.76s]  They haven't even finished that show yet. How can the meme be dead before the show is over?
[25573.00s -> 25576.46s]  The problem with the show is they keep doing
[25577.05s -> 25578.59s]  final season
[25578.59s -> 25580.83s]  attack on titan last season part two
[25581.55s -> 25583.47s]  final season
[25583.47s -> 25587.08s]  part three aaron's final moments part one
[25592.80s -> 25597.36s]  All right. I i'm picking this thing. I'm doing this. We're gonna upgrade this thing all the way
[25600.35s -> 25603.95s]  Okay, I need 30. I need one smithing stone five. Do you have one?
[25609.71s -> 25617.87s]  No, I have a four and a seven i'm the weird one i want to make sure everyone knows that
[25620.09s -> 25623.13s]  We've got a four and then a seven and then like an ancient
[25623.69s -> 25624.97s]  dragon one
[25624.97s -> 25627.63s]  That's good enough
[25627.63s -> 25631.15s]  Okay, what what is yours upgraded to can I like drop your finger on the ground for you?
[25631.47s -> 25634.11s]  This is plus five at this point plus four
[25634.67s -> 25641.79s]  You're just making up numbers
[25641.79s -> 25644.91s]  Okay, you want to go back to ray of lucaria with like a wait. We did that right?
[25644.99s -> 25648.35s]  No, we didn't the way to do syrax that's gonna be interesting
[25648.83s -> 25658.52s]  But yes, okay. What do I need to upgrade one more time? I gotta have hold on
[25662.59s -> 25664.59s]  Should I just put points into intelligence or no?
[25665.07s -> 25687.72s]  Level in yeah, I can respect in a minute. Okay, let's go. We need to go to
[25689.24s -> 25691.84s]  Which one is it?
[25691.84s -> 25693.28s]  it is
[25693.28s -> 25700.00s]  Without the map. It's kind of hard to see. All right. Where we going church of the cuckoo or what is uh debate parlor?
[25700.24s -> 25706.99s]  It's worth it for the sword
[25706.99s -> 25714.60s]  Yeah, i'll be able to do a full respect after this. This is perfect. No amount of intelligence will fix your brain
[25714.76s -> 25722.17s]  Actually, I think a lot of intelligence would fix my brain because i'd be smarter stir
[25722.17s -> 25727.13s]  Can we get a la la, please? A lot of people are asking for it a la la. Yes a la la
[25728.00s -> 25739.61s]  Like the guy from uh better call sol. Yes. I don't think I can do that
[25741.29s -> 25745.61s]  I feel like you probably could was it la la or la lo? I think it was la la. I'm dude, dude
[25746.17s -> 25750.83s]  You don't think you could do it. I don't know what you're asking for to do an impression
[25752.16s -> 25755.52s]  Is that what is that what you were actually asking for because I feel like I went way off
[25755.76s -> 25758.56s]  No, I was asking for you to do an impression of love la la
[25760.06s -> 25770.67s]  Can you give an example? Yes, like hold on. I just don't want to get hit
[25781.92s -> 25784.40s]  Just say la la
[25784.40s -> 25786.60s]  No, that's no I
[25786.60s -> 25788.04s]  la la
[25788.04s -> 25789.00s]  I don't know
[25789.00s -> 25791.28s]  What am I a part of right now?
[25791.28s -> 25793.71s]  Never mind
[25793.71s -> 25795.71s]  Why is it never mind now?
[25796.27s -> 25813.50s]  I've I was busy doing something. There's a secret down there. It's not from
[25814.46s -> 25816.46s]  Breaking bad
[25820.06s -> 25822.54s]  Okay, I thought you guys were linking I was asking you for lines
[25823.58s -> 25825.58s]  That this character says
[25825.58s -> 25827.58s]  I can't remember
[25827.58s -> 25835.39s]  Can you just tell a joke already la la
[25837.26s -> 25839.21s]  there
[25839.21s -> 25841.50s]  Okay, and what is that?
[25841.50s -> 25843.74s]  I don't really even know dude like
[25869.71s -> 25871.87s]  there comes
[25871.87s -> 25874.27s]  Block it tank it block block it tanking
[25887.64s -> 25889.88s]  You can't even see where his body is
[25891.16s -> 25894.68s]  And he can't it seems like he can't see us either because he doesn't really actually attack you
[25895.24s -> 25897.82s]  No, not really
[25897.82s -> 25899.02s]  dude
[25899.02s -> 25906.32s]  What the fuck
[25906.32s -> 25909.12s]  I can't believe placidusex is the queen of the full moon
[25912.09s -> 25914.09s]  I still have not got an estus upgrade
[25915.66s -> 25919.82s]  Okay, I sure hope he's aggro'd to you because i'm just rolling
[25920.62s -> 25922.62s]  at random intervals
[25925.04s -> 25926.88s]  I think he's on you
[25926.88s -> 25928.16s]  He is
[25928.16s -> 25931.55s]  He does not like you
[25932.03s -> 25934.03s]  He just wants to kill you so bad
[25934.51s -> 25943.58s]  I have no more healing
[25943.58s -> 25945.58s]  This is fucking terrible
[25948.96s -> 25950.96s]  There's nothing I could do there
[25951.28s -> 25954.16s]  I didn't even realize he was I I don't know you're you're naked
[25957.92s -> 25971.15s]  ow
[25971.15s -> 25973.15s]  Dude, his ass is so big. I
[25973.63s -> 25984.76s]  Okay. Well, at least you didn't have to do with the infinite flicker strike teleportation. I'm inside the wall
[25985.38s -> 25986.68s]  ability
[25986.68s -> 25989.61s]  There's no way I beat this
[25989.61s -> 25990.73s]  Here we go
[25990.73s -> 25991.85s]  dodge it
[25991.85s -> 25994.73s]  I just did
[25994.73s -> 25999.13s]  I don't know that you dodged it or that he spawned in a situation where he couldn't swing at you
[25999.13s -> 26001.13s]  I just dodged it right there
[26001.13s -> 26004.14s]  Just dodged it right there again
[26004.14s -> 26008.16s]  Yeah, I don't know about that
[26010.48s -> 26017.07s]  I think this he has a second phase
[26017.77s -> 26020.49s]  Just like rinala. I don't think the random enemies
[26021.29s -> 26023.29s]  properly trigger second phases
[26024.91s -> 26026.35s]  Where is he?
[26026.35s -> 26028.68s]  He's coming
[26028.68s -> 26031.98s]  Or not. I think he's stuck in the wall
[26041.66s -> 26044.86s]  Die come on die die die die die. He fell out of the world. Come on die
[26046.67s -> 26048.67s]  He literally fell all the way down
[26049.31s -> 26055.37s]  Come on really
[26055.37s -> 26058.01s]  Yo, I can't imagine fighting like radon in this room
[26058.57s -> 26062.30s]  No
[26062.30s -> 26064.86s]  Like what if he actually got to do his meteor?
[26065.66s -> 26069.13s]  Where would you go?
[26069.13s -> 26079.98s]  dead
[26079.98s -> 26081.98s]  Use your magical potion
[26102.59s -> 26106.60s]  So what's the plan you want to go for it again? Um, I think if I can
[26107.64s -> 26110.68s]  Survive the teleportation phase it could be better
[26112.44s -> 26114.44s]  Can you drop golden seeds?
[26115.72s -> 26117.72s]  because if you can can I just
[26118.12s -> 26119.32s]  I had you
[26119.32s -> 26120.76s]  No, you can't
[26120.76s -> 26122.51s]  Wait, can you?
[26122.51s -> 26124.51s]  Hmm. I think I can
[26124.99s -> 26128.88s]  No, I need the what is the flask upgrade one?
[26129.68s -> 26131.20s]  sacred tear like
[26131.20s -> 26132.56s]  That's what I need
[26132.56s -> 26134.56s]  Yeah, I only have one of those
[26134.56s -> 26138.00s]  It's actually really bad when you need to drink twice to feel your health. Yeah, it's yeah
[26138.00s -> 26140.00s]  I'm drinking like three or four times right now
[26158.84s -> 26160.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
[26175.56s -> 26177.56s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[26178.89s -> 26180.88s]  Take 10 of these
[26180.88s -> 26188.49s]  Put it on your bar
[26188.49s -> 26193.68s]  Okay, that negates like a ton of damage like almost all physical damage or something
[26194.32s -> 26197.04s]  How do how long they last? I don't know but you have 10 of them
[26198.96s -> 26205.63s]  And if we need more I know where they are. It only blocks physical damage, but that's a big deal
[26219.08s -> 26221.08s]  All right. So before we go in the store
[26221.16s -> 26223.16s]  Fucking snap into a slim gym, right?
[26250.54s -> 26252.14s]  Oh my god
[26252.14s -> 26288.72s]  I what I rolled
[26288.72s -> 26293.05s]  Here it is again. Really? That's unfair. Can you jump over this?
[26293.53s -> 26313.08s]  I doubt it. Nope. He's cheesing us this time. We're actually not in a terrible position
[26313.64s -> 26323.15s]  Okay, i'm eating another
[26323.15s -> 26325.31s]  Where is he? All right. He's in this chandelier
[26325.95s -> 26329.15s]  The chandelier he's a bookcase now
[26329.31s -> 26335.50s]  Oh shit
[26335.50s -> 26341.10s]  No, not no, dude. Come on. What was that? That was horseshit. That actually was stupid
[26354.40s -> 26356.40s]  That same that yeah
[26356.48s -> 26360.72s]  You're not in a bad spot. You're all right. You know, do you still?
[26361.68s -> 26363.68s]  I have no more healing
[26366.89s -> 26372.14s]  Better than last time
[26372.14s -> 26376.99s]  You can hear him
[26379.15s -> 26382.11s]  That's what yeah, it happened to me last time I thought he died that would have been awesome
[26385.52s -> 26387.52s]  Hey, it's still winnable. Yeah, it's true
[26387.84s -> 26410.32s]  I don't know what he's doing. Uh, no you're dead
[26413.82s -> 26416.28s]  No, you're all right
[26416.28s -> 26418.12s]  I thought he was doing the thing in the ground
[26418.12s -> 26422.04s]  Yeah, I was trying to like look up to see what movie was even doing. I think I waste a lot of time doing it
[26425.53s -> 26432.04s]  I think we can do it. Yeah, I think you got like you shouldn't have died that early
[26432.12s -> 26432.92s]  Yeah, sorry there bud
[26432.92s -> 26438.04s]  But like like I think you shouldn't have died there if you watch the vaude he I got hit by a swipe
[26438.20s -> 26444.04s]  And then he started doing the breath immediately directly pinpointing my exact location that I was standing right there and hit me directly
[26444.12s -> 26450.86s]  Right before I even iframes to kick down. Yeah, but like I feel like I feel like you shouldn't have died there
[26451.18s -> 26458.97s]  I really you shouldn't have died there either. You still did. Yeah. Well, I feel like you should have been there to help
[26459.74s -> 26461.10s]  I was died
[26461.10s -> 26465.71s]  Dermott's a good point. Hey
[26465.95s -> 26484.80s]  Hey, I got a feeling this is the one I had that feeling too
[26484.88s -> 26487.28s]  but I don't know we've been married for a while now and
[26489.44s -> 26490.72s]  We can um
[26490.72s -> 26500.49s]  I'm trying to think is it where's the ball? I'm at the elevator
[26503.05s -> 26522.49s]  weird
[26522.49s -> 26524.49s]  All right. Let's focus on surviving
[26525.05s -> 26526.81s]  and focus on
[26526.81s -> 26528.81s]  thriving being
[26529.26s -> 26533.50s]  Good. All right. Okay surviving and being good is our strat
[26534.97s -> 26538.99s]  Eat your thing. Hey, don't forget who got those by the way
[26539.55s -> 26542.60s]  I'm not completely useless
[26542.60s -> 26545.48s]  The trade merchant. All right, no more fucking around. Let's go
[26546.20s -> 26547.64s]  This is the real one
[26547.64s -> 26562.76s]  Stop fucking around. I didn't even see where he swung dude
[26563.58s -> 26580.64s]  There's no way to see it
[26580.64s -> 26590.62s]  That's unfortunate. We're good. He's doing it again. He is
[26591.34s -> 26604.52s]  Who knows what he's doing?
[26604.68s -> 26606.68s]  Can't see his body
[26616.40s -> 26620.16s]  What was I supposed to do there was nothing I could do there
[26620.96s -> 26631.58s]  I've got four flasks this time
[26642.08s -> 26645.45s]  What i'll be honest, I don't even know what hit you
[26646.84s -> 26649.48s]  Like the attack was over and I did like so much damage
[26650.57s -> 26652.73s]  He's just he just fills the whole arena
[26656.57s -> 26658.33s]  I mean to be fair
[26658.33s -> 26660.97s]  This is one of the last bosses of elden ring
[26662.27s -> 26663.64s]  so
[26663.64s -> 26665.64s]  Is there anywhere else we can go?
[26665.64s -> 26667.64s]  There's tons of places we can go
[26685.12s -> 26693.63s]  Is just he just fills the whole arena with that yellow shit. Honestly, you could do this. I think we could
[26694.43s -> 26698.91s]  Just the problem is just that yellow flame if you're in the wrong spot you're dead
[26699.71s -> 26704.24s]  I think i'm just gonna let him kill me here and we give it one more try one more college try
[26705.34s -> 26708.06s]  It's hard to know what is the wrong spot too because he's so big
[26720.20s -> 26722.68s]  I think with your like it if you were just here
[26724.06s -> 26730.78s]  The extra amount of dps he'd be dead. Yeah, I i'm telling you I got I got completely screwed over twice in a row
[26731.42s -> 26736.92s]  Let's go. Let's fucking get this boy
[26737.32s -> 26739.82s]  We can do it. Okay
[26740.22s -> 26743.15s]  So
[26745.29s -> 26756.97s]  It is winnable it's very winnable what if you were good at the game
[26759.44s -> 26768.60s]  Um, I don't know
[26768.60s -> 26773.45s]  No, i'm not going on another i'm not no i'm not going on. No
[26774.17s -> 26777.77s]  We're not no i'm having this we're just i'm just walked off the edge
[26803.42s -> 26805.42s]  This time I hope I do not get
[26805.82s -> 26806.94s]  double
[26806.94s -> 26811.77s]  Double hit by that yellow flame. That's what happened last time
[26812.57s -> 26816.73s]  It's like it's it was still a little faint whisper of that shit that hit me twice
[26817.21s -> 26821.05s]  No, I don't get hit but at once if you fall on the ground from flame
[26821.21s -> 26826.33s]  I don't know if you know, but don't start rolling just like lay on the ground. Thank you. Thank you that
[26827.29s -> 26830.65s]  I don't it really is that sarcastic? No, no, no, i'm dead serious
[26830.65s -> 26833.13s]  I did I actually did not think about that. That's true
[26833.21s -> 26835.53s]  You you get a lot more eye frames if you lay on the ground
[26835.93s -> 26839.93s]  A lot of dragons will like put you on the ground if you panic and get up it it hits you instantly again
[26840.09s -> 26842.09s]  I you know, i'm not even kidding. I did not know that
[26843.37s -> 26848.03s]  Okay, let's go
[26848.27s -> 26851.95s]  I'm so not sure no, I I swear I promise I promise
[26852.67s -> 26869.50s]  My game lagged like yeah, like okay my game froze
[26870.14s -> 26876.54s]  And then I fell on the ground from the fire. Yeah, and it like it kept a buffered roll and I stood up into the fire again
[26877.18s -> 26879.18s]  Uh, I probably should just die here shouldn't I?
[26880.40s -> 26882.40s]  We were doing really good. We were doing all right
[26882.96s -> 26890.64s]  I got through his health pretty quickly
[26890.80s -> 26898.88s]  Yeah, you actually do a lot of damage compared to what i've been doing. I mean i don't
[26899.92s -> 26903.50s]  I think you could beat him
[26915.71s -> 26920.41s]  Does he know about the dodge button? He's trying to get me to growl at you and i'm not gonna do it
[26922.17s -> 26924.33s]  He did it he's mad more mad than I am
[26925.77s -> 26932.11s]  Stop. Oh, do you not like that? Does that make you like uncomfortable? Can auto hear me is auto uncomfortable?
[26936.57s -> 26938.57s]  Are you just like not like?
[26938.97s -> 26940.97s]  People
[26942.17s -> 26951.40s]  Let's go. Yeah, this one's winnable. Is your monitor turned on? Oh my god
[26952.36s -> 26953.98s]  What the fuck?
[26953.98s -> 26955.98s]  Your mom was turned on last night
[26956.46s -> 26958.52s]  chatter
[26958.52s -> 26966.94s]  because of me
[26966.94s -> 26976.03s]  I yeah, what the heck stop
[26976.91s -> 26979.20s]  rude
[26979.20s -> 26982.19s]  All right. So here's the deal
[26982.19s -> 26985.07s]  If we don't beat him this time, we're gonna go fight another couple of bosses
[26987.16s -> 26988.12s]  Okay
[26988.12s -> 26991.96s]  Okay. Yeah, there's like a million catacombs we can go down into there's tons of stuff
[26992.04s -> 26997.88s]  We don't have to fight like the last like top three top five last bosses in the whole game
[26998.52s -> 27000.52s]  We we we can come back
[27003.10s -> 27025.76s]  Eat your slim jim
[27036.36s -> 27038.76s]  What the fuck are you doing a game?
[27039.72s -> 27047.68s]  Probably fine
[27047.68s -> 27054.91s]  Fucking slay queen
[27054.99s -> 27058.25s]  I'm gonna slay this queen
[27058.25s -> 27060.25s]  Here comes the thingy
[27063.85s -> 27067.21s]  Yeah, we can be hitting him during that we got time. I am terrified of that
[27067.85s -> 27073.74s]  I'll be honest
[27073.74s -> 27075.74s]  Watch out. He's doing that spraying that shit over here
[27076.56s -> 27080.56s]  What the fuck are you talking? Okay, stop being a weirdo
[27082.33s -> 27084.33s]  Yeah, i've gone through a lot of flasks this place
[27087.64s -> 27092.28s]  I prefer phase two at this point. I don't know. We're not we're doing okay. Everything's fine
[27093.56s -> 27095.56s]  That was a quick transition though from
[27100.17s -> 27103.05s]  What I think he hit the wall?
[27116.27s -> 27119.07s]  Oh, you're in trouble. He's doing that stupid shit over there. I'm good
[27121.15s -> 27123.87s]  You're in trouble. Um, no, no, i'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine
[27129.64s -> 27131.64s]  Playing it safe. Yeah me too
[27142.51s -> 27144.51s]  And until he like just hops
[27144.67s -> 27147.39s]  Changes his angle and lights the whole room on fire
[27148.35s -> 27165.00s]  He can do it
[27165.00s -> 27167.00s]  Where the fuck were they?
[27181.07s -> 27200.43s]  Maybe all right. Where do you want to go? The guy's in the wall. I can't see where the fuck he is
[27202.17s -> 27208.49s]  Do you want to go again? You want to prove the haters wrong?
[27209.45s -> 27216.99s]  No, I don't you want to tell them this is a ridiculous boss fight in this tiny supper one more
[27220.20s -> 27225.00s]  All right one more and actually I think it might be better. I have like
[27225.64s -> 27231.64s]  Somebody's lightning liver. Somebody's got it right. I want to just respec and if we beat him that means I get to respec
[27232.46s -> 27236.59s]  Yeah, I just want that that sweet spot
[27237.31s -> 27241.69s]  I think i'm gonna go on like uh
[27241.69s -> 27244.81s]  Use left trigger. I don't think I I don't have enough intelligence to do it
[27245.53s -> 27250.04s]  I don't think I can even do that move
[27250.04s -> 27261.34s]  Don't you need it? Hold on. Oh, I don't like what do you mean? You're too dumb to press left trigger. That's true
[27265.66s -> 27267.34s]  Do a fully charged heavy
[27267.34s -> 27273.15s]  I think it's not gonna do that much more damage
[27273.15s -> 27277.90s]  All right, let's go
[27277.90s -> 27282.22s]  It'll do extra damage, but I have to hold it much longer. I'll try it. See
[27282.86s -> 27331.28s]  Watch out for that fire. You might do it usually does it like right now comes this bullshit
[27340.57s -> 27342.57s]  Yeah, i'm like basically out of flasks
[27342.73s -> 27348.19s]  already
[27348.19s -> 27354.68s]  Jesus
[27354.68s -> 27356.68s]  It's just so hard to see what his body's doing
[27362.10s -> 27373.34s]  Jesus it's like i'm it's like i'm hitting a mountain
[27374.62s -> 27375.82s]  All right
[27375.82s -> 27377.82s]  Pull up swings. Pull up. Pull up
[27378.30s -> 27384.96s]  He's going to second phase. All right, weird weird eat another one of your uh, uh, uh, you know my goober berries. Yes
[27387.02s -> 27391.37s]  spread out too
[27391.45s -> 27393.93s]  Okay, we're good. We're good different. Just just have everybody chill out
[27396.00s -> 27404.32s]  Oh, no
[27404.32s -> 27414.99s]  You gotta be shitting me. I dodged right through it. This was the one
[27418.38s -> 27420.01s]  Yeah
[27420.01s -> 27422.73s]  What that was weird? I don't know what just happened, but he's over here
[27427.64s -> 27430.33s]  Bro, what?
[27430.33s -> 27432.33s]  Are you doing over here man?
[27434.04s -> 27438.97s]  What?
[27438.97s -> 27439.93s]  What?
[27439.93s -> 27445.50s]  Dude, you got so much surface area here. Look at this. So he's gonna pick the same three spots
[27456.99s -> 27470.28s]  I'm so lucky that didn't hit me. All right, here comes the area of back bullshit
[27471.00s -> 27473.90s]  Where'd he go?
[27473.90s -> 27476.16s]  He's gonna drop it on me
[27476.16s -> 27478.00s]  I hope where did he go?
[27478.00s -> 27481.56s]  Oh, he's teleporting
[27481.56s -> 27483.56s]  Yeah, the claw into the flame
[27485.88s -> 27489.24s]  What the fuck is he doing right now, man? He's doing laser beam. He hit him
[27525.74s -> 27529.32s]  Fucking clown box
[27531.60s -> 27532.73s]  I
[27532.73s -> 27541.98s]  I thought you would have had him there too if that didn't hit you but like who can tell what?
[27542.22s -> 27546.52s]  Oh, you need to rest at the bonfire. I'm still in the fight
[27547.92s -> 27550.54s]  What that was so unfair?
[27552.04s -> 27554.20s]  What happened? What did he just what did he do?
[27555.00s -> 27557.92s]  What did he just?
[27557.92s -> 27561.02s]  Happened
[27561.02s -> 27563.98s]  Uh, what happened? He's not playing fair
[27564.86s -> 27570.49s]  He's a weapon you have stats for
[27571.10s -> 27573.98s]  Uh, I had it a store currently owns it. He
[27574.78s -> 27576.78s]  The store has it in his inventory
[27578.89s -> 27582.65s]  The issue is not the damage you're doing more damage than me
[27584.32s -> 27586.00s]  the issue is
[27586.00s -> 27591.52s]  Sometimes uses flame attacks. So what why did I then you die? Okay, so he did a flame attack
[27592.94s -> 27596.22s]  And then it was over and then I died. Was that the laser?
[27596.94s -> 27602.22s]  That's the one where he goes super psycho mode and does lasers in like 400 million directions. Oh my god
[27602.38s -> 27606.09s]  We both got yeah
[27606.09s -> 27610.68s]  Oh, can we do a warming stone?
[27610.68s -> 27615.00s]  Somebody said two hand the shield. That's not a bad idea. That might actually work
[27615.95s -> 27626.09s]  I wonder no don't potion why because we can put a warming stone down before we go in
[27627.69s -> 27631.24s]  All right, we can just chill out we can talk about
[27632.62s -> 27635.98s]  I can't I I thought he was dead too. I thought his move was over
[27636.06s -> 27657.79s]  I don't even know what I got hit by don't go in he was near a pillar his laser explodes on contact with ground
[27657.79s -> 27659.39s]  You stood near his head
[27659.39s -> 27661.55s]  Which was near the pillar and the
[27663.92s -> 27667.52s]  The laser beam exploded the pillar. Oh, that's so sad
[27668.24s -> 27670.08s]  That's so sad
[27670.08s -> 27672.08s]  Shots four and five clearly missed
[27679.23s -> 27682.59s]  I'm gonna drop a warming stone during like the phase transition as well
[27686.91s -> 27689.71s]  I didn't mean to do that. I'm just so shooken up right now
[27691.77s -> 27710.81s]  Sorry, we'll get a writer
[27710.81s -> 27712.81s]  You gotta seriously dude
[27713.80s -> 27717.72s]  I'm dead
[27717.72s -> 27723.32s]  I got trapped
[27723.32s -> 27725.56s]  I got trapped. He did it twice in the same area
[27726.20s -> 27731.76s]  I need you to focus up, dude
[27731.76s -> 27733.76s]  The guild needs this
[27736.51s -> 27740.27s]  Okay, you have no idea how hard I was just holding it not just getting wicked pissed
[27741.53s -> 27747.36s]  Okay, we're good. I'm so glad you said that because that was really funny and it just like
[27752.06s -> 27761.26s]  The fact that the guild needs me right now is that's so funny I was about to be like the fuck do you know
[27762.78s -> 27766.62s]  You're gonna do like a noise like that. No one's gonna know what it means. But like you would know
[27773.74s -> 27805.56s]  Okay, it's a combination of being in the right place
[27806.12s -> 27807.93s]  Not being too greedy
[27807.93s -> 27813.53s]  Uh getting good rng on the moves. I mean the area is tiny. There's not a whole lot of wiggle room
[27814.01s -> 27817.53s]  I forget how you even double hand your your shield on your offhand
[27819.40s -> 27822.92s]  Uh, I can but uh, I was just told that that does not help
[27823.64s -> 27825.00s]  Oh, okay
[27825.00s -> 27831.00s]  From what I was told could be wrong. Let's try it again
[27831.64s -> 27835.96s]  I'm only gonna use the clam powder the clam chowder in the second phase
[27836.68s -> 27840.65s]  I used all mine
[27840.89s -> 27842.81s]  Oh, I felt like six
[27842.81s -> 27843.93s]  Really?
[27843.93s -> 27880.25s]  Yeah
[27880.25s -> 27882.25s]  That's the claw fire
[27882.81s -> 27884.01s]  And
[27884.01s -> 27893.80s]  There's nowhere to go
[27893.80s -> 27894.76s]  No
[27894.76s -> 27899.55s]  No, no
[27899.55s -> 27921.58s]  No
[27921.58s -> 27923.58s]  Nice nice. He's staggered. Ooh
[27929.85s -> 27966.11s]  All right, dropping a warming stone in the center. Yep. He's going up easy easy careful
[27968.92s -> 27986.16s]  All right smelling warming stone in the center. I had no idea where he was. He says all right fire incoming
[28016.32s -> 28017.44s]  you
[28017.44s -> 28021.77s]  Can't be serious. All right. It's all right. Sorry you got he killed me instantly with the laser
[28022.41s -> 28063.10s]  Yeah, I like saw you die in one shot. You got it. You got it. Come on for the guild. Where the fuck is he?
[28072.32s -> 28075.93s]  Okay, I couldn't even hit him
[28076.65s -> 28105.77s]  I thought he was doing the fire after the swings. I started trying to run. I know there was like a return swing
[28106.60s -> 28113.45s]  Okay, so the lightning once he's in when he's in phase two do not be in front of him for any reason
[28114.60s -> 28117.08s]  He does that laser light show and it instantly kills you
[28118.16s -> 28121.20s]  That's what killed you the other time and it goes on for a really long time
[28122.80s -> 28127.04s]  That's unfortunate. I'm out of warming stones, too. I think they helped a lot. I don't know if you have any
[28127.36s -> 28132.68s]  Uh, let me check. I don't think I do though. We could that was so close. I think we can do it warming stones
[28134.27s -> 28138.28s]  I don't think I have any
[28138.28s -> 28140.28s]  No, I don't think so
[28140.28s -> 28144.56s]  I might have I mean buff on
[28144.56s -> 28150.19s]  Shit, I don't know how I would check we could take rune arcs. Couldn't we I do have a debuff on?
[28150.67s -> 28153.15s]  Fuck I had a reduced attack debuff
[28156.54s -> 28160.14s]  Apparently the warming stones heal the bots. Oh do they?
[28160.78s -> 28162.14s]  That's so funny
[28162.14s -> 28170.03s]  Oh, all right. I mean that was that was pretty good. That was pretty good. This is tough. This is not easy
[28170.59s -> 28172.16s]  This is tricky
[28172.16s -> 28182.46s]  Your weapon is a stagger do jump attacks
[28183.02s -> 28186.06s]  I mean I do it just it's hard to get in there, but I I do
[28187.82s -> 28189.82s]  Oh my god. Okay. I am
[28192.65s -> 28197.29s]  I want to see if we can I forget if there's a shortcut over here because I need to rest the bonfire get rid of my
[28197.29s -> 28200.60s]  debuff
[28200.60s -> 28202.52s]  What you have a debuff right now or no, you didn't yeah
[28202.92s -> 28206.68s]  I think during that fight I had a reduced attack debuff the whole time really
[28206.92s -> 28209.72s]  Well, let's just let's do this. Let's go up and take care of this shit
[28210.68s -> 28217.15s]  What is going on?
[28217.96s -> 28222.20s]  Because of the weird way that like last time I died and you had to reset it and then I resp I don't know
[28222.60s -> 28225.88s]  Uh, what's gonna happen or how long I had it. Let's turn the stupid ball off
[28229.44s -> 28231.68s]  Well, we can just do this shortcut for now on
[28232.24s -> 28240.80s]  I'm getting rid of that ball. Well, I'm saying the shortcut ignores the ball. Oh, never mind. There's a giant dog up here
[28240.80s -> 28242.80s]  I don't care about that anymore
[28242.80s -> 28251.29s]  I'm gonna go rest. I'll be back
[28251.37s -> 28253.37s]  Shortcut is literally going to be worse. Apparently why?
[28254.67s -> 28257.87s]  Uh, it seems a lot better because of the random enemies that are there
[28258.03s -> 28266.51s]  They're not like super threatening the way they normally are. Where did you go all the way back? Yeah, I rested
[28272.59s -> 28274.59s]  It's usually worse
[28274.99s -> 28278.43s]  Yeah, because they usually spam like homing magic at you. But right now it's like
[28280.18s -> 28284.28s]  Undead that are just like kind of looking at me. I just ran right by everyone. There's no problem
[28285.24s -> 28286.68s]  It's way easier
[28286.68s -> 28290.12s]  Uh, and then we then we don't need to deal with the ball. Let me actually
[28290.92s -> 28293.96s]  I I have six flasks. I need to get my field back up
[28294.84s -> 28296.84s]  Okay, I should
[28296.92s -> 28299.40s]  Man, I forgot but I should take my mana flask off
[28300.52s -> 28306.38s]  Because i'm not really casting mat. Jesus. Fuck that was longer ranged. I thought i'm just I don't I'm just going
[28306.38s -> 28308.38s]  I don't even care. I'm just gonna go back
[28308.62s -> 28312.59s]  I could beat this boss by myself
[28314.54s -> 28316.54s]  Are you you respawned at the bonfire, right?
[28317.74s -> 28320.70s]  I'm i'm killing myself and i'm gonna i'm gonna come back with you
[28321.34s -> 28324.70s]  So that I can reset my flask like one extra flask would help a lot. Yeah
[28325.26s -> 28326.46s]  um
[28326.46s -> 28328.78s]  We've gotten him two or three times down to like
[28329.72s -> 28331.24s]  less than five percent
[28331.24s -> 28337.80s]  When are you gonna play the great ace attorney games?
[28337.80s -> 28340.92s]  My uncle doesn't care because he doesn't know who you are, but I do
[28342.84s -> 28350.51s]  Uh, what does your uncle have to do with any of that? That's
[28351.39s -> 28359.55s]  I don't I don't expect your uncle to know who I am. I'll play it
[28366.48s -> 28368.48s]  Yeah, but he's gonna play jade cocoon first
[28369.04s -> 28371.04s]  I actually need to find that game
[28371.68s -> 28395.32s]  Are you guys just hoping that the second boss is gonna be easier when you kill this one?
[28398.30s -> 28400.30s]  I don't think there is one
[28400.30s -> 28402.30s]  There wasn't a phase two for rayo lucario
[28402.86s -> 28407.69s]  Would it be a phase two for this? Well, I mean that boss doesn't usually have phase two the base boss
[28407.77s -> 28412.25s]  But I still don't do like it doesn't matter. We're gonna win right now. I don't want to hear anyone say
[28414.01s -> 28419.53s]  It does nothing matters. We're about to win right now. So like doesn't even matter what you're saying, you know, that's a good point
[28420.17s -> 28424.33s]  Because we are the hey bod watchers. This is the one skip to here
[28425.61s -> 28436.49s]  Because it does just a bad start like I just got screwed
[28442.65s -> 28447.53s]  Again again just really poor really just bad fucking start overall bad
[28449.28s -> 28453.92s]  It was just a bad start overall. It was a bad start overall. I could feel it the second we walked through the door
[28454.48s -> 28455.52s]  Okay
[28455.52s -> 28459.60s]  The vibe was off. It was the vibe was so wrong. It was off completely
[28460.64s -> 28466.51s]  It's just like I would I would do a move and he would time it perfectly to put something on the ground that
[28467.31s -> 28470.59s]  You know what? I mean? It was just the vibe was just the vibes were off on that
[28470.67s -> 28473.79s]  The fight always starts off three lightnings
[28475.29s -> 28478.91s]  Be aware be aware. I know but the just do the vibe
[28480.03s -> 28488.91s]  I'm not disagreeing with you. The vibe was off dude
[28489.07s -> 28495.79s]  If I just had like glint stone omega kamehameha and then I could fucking kamehameha him and then hit the gritty
[28499.08s -> 28500.60s]  Hit the gritty
[28500.60s -> 28502.00s]  Yeah
[28502.00s -> 28505.04s]  Okay, come on. He doesn't know we can do it
[28505.60s -> 28510.62s]  We have been playing for eight hours. I mean that doesn't have it might be hitting game or fatigue. It's possible
[28511.34s -> 28514.43s]  Yeah for like old people
[28514.43s -> 28518.81s]  Well, I I we could be hitting game or fatigue
[28519.53s -> 28521.63s]  For old people
[28521.63s -> 28524.57s]  You didn't even eat
[28524.57s -> 28526.94s]  Do I need to yeah
[28526.94s -> 28533.66s]  No fasting it keeps your mind present like i'm i'm on the hunt for some food and that food is pasadousis axes
[28536.70s -> 28539.52s]  What is this character's name?
[28539.52s -> 28544.40s]  Me strong. No, no, no the boss we're fighting get it right and spell it correctly and i'll give you 100 dollars
[28546.17s -> 28548.41s]  pass
[28548.41s -> 28554.56s]  Placid do sex. Okay. Now now now do it for me do what for you? I don't know either
[28555.82s -> 28557.82s]  It's like placid oxics
[28557.82s -> 28561.58s]  I think I could have done it if we took a moment, but I want to fucking fight this thing
[28561.58s -> 28564.38s]  Can you be like focused you like dodge a little red lightning that's about to come down?
[28566.04s -> 28570.76s]  Not take any like greed swings and like die in the first fucking phase. I didn't
[28573.76s -> 28575.76s]  You show me what your made up for the guild
[28580.14s -> 28584.70s]  You got double hit by the fire guy, but I did I didn't know but you don't understand. I didn't jump
[28585.02s -> 28587.02s]  I didn't get up. I did what you said
[28588.51s -> 28590.51s]  Seems like I only got hit once
[28590.91s -> 28606.78s]  What even just I hit my head on the fucking treasure box. I'm just relaxed
[28608.27s -> 28614.76s]  guild needs you
[28614.76s -> 28617.56s]  Fucking only fighter that's online at this time
[28620.20s -> 28622.20s]  You don't understand. I got so screwed
[28630.88s -> 28633.50s]  I mean like just run away
[28634.12s -> 28639.24s]  If you're worried you're gonna get hit you can also always like you you actually can't go anywhere when he does that. Oh my god
[28640.12s -> 28642.09s]  Did I do it?
[28642.09s -> 28643.05s]  Yeah
[28643.05s -> 28645.69s]  I didn't
[28645.93s -> 28647.93s]  I thought you're gonna yell at me and say don't do it
[28647.93s -> 28652.17s]  So I tried to predict I was on the ground the whole time. I tried. No, no, we're good. We're good. Everything's fine
[28652.65s -> 28654.65s]  We're good. We did a lot of damage
[28655.05s -> 28658.33s]  Everyone's screaming at me. You don't understand the last few times. It's like we're good
[28661.47s -> 28663.44s]  Oh dodged
[28663.44s -> 28665.44s]  like a mouse
[28673.52s -> 28675.52s]  Okay focus
[28678.24s -> 28680.24s]  You gotta focus
[28681.20s -> 28683.20s]  That was so stupid
[28689.69s -> 28694.91s]  Bringing it back
[28694.91s -> 28698.51s]  You can't even see when the rocks come out. It's such what's manure
[28699.39s -> 28703.61s]  Oh my i'm just getting infinite combo
[28706.84s -> 28707.88s]  beam
[28707.88s -> 28720.36s]  It's a good thing. I'd use three flasks for that
[28724.19s -> 28732.62s]  Okay, it's getting close to beam health like don't don't get beamed. I'm gonna try as hard as I can to not get beamed
[28733.50s -> 28740.83s]  Do we even know do we even know?
[28742.20s -> 28744.89s]  Do we even know
[28744.89s -> 28746.89s]  What lies beyond in the infinite void?
[28747.45s -> 28749.61s]  He's beaming into the wall. Now's our opportunity
[28754.83s -> 28760.03s]  That was such a huge rng player right there. Come on. Come on. Come on. Kill him. Kill him. Come on like a boss, man
[28760.75s -> 28762.75s]  Like a fucking boss
[28763.39s -> 28766.03s]  Oh, thank all right. No phase two. No phase two. No phase two
[28774.25s -> 28780.32s]  Oh, I skipped I don't
[28782.84s -> 28784.84s]  All right, we got it we got it we got it
[28785.48s -> 28808.94s]  Sucks it's the easiest boss of the fucking whole game. Just relax. Just take your time. Look at that damage. Look at that
[28862.54s -> 28864.54s]  Stop don't laugh. Don't laugh
[28866.04s -> 28868.04s]  What you're gonna get me going don't
[28868.04s -> 28896.59s]  Are you i'm alive stay alive stay alive, dude, if you have to just warming stone back there do it
[28897.16s -> 28905.39s]  I don't have any I was my low hp every once in a while
[28905.39s -> 28928.25s]  I'm gonna hit one time and then run away to take out girl fucker
[28928.89s -> 28984.78s]  That one didn't count
[28987.05s -> 28989.29s]  Oh, this weapon is fucking slow as shit
[28990.70s -> 28999.07s]  With my sword alone. I was having a hard time getting a single hit in well that was um, that was interesting
[28999.31s -> 29008.72s]  This is easy like a boss
[29012.99s -> 29017.39s]  Oh, I feel like I could have done that too. It's just it's been so long since seeing that second phase
[29017.63s -> 29019.63s]  I got fucking one shot by the bow
[29019.71s -> 29022.99s]  That thing is always so hard for me to dodge like in the beginning of radon's fight
[29023.15s -> 29026.27s]  And he's like i'm gonna shoot one really slow missile at you across the map
[29026.35s -> 29030.83s]  I always miss time it the bow my weakness you gotta go forward. You gotta dodge forward
[29031.63s -> 29037.79s]  Only go forward. So you like make sense only dodge forward if you dodge back left or right you'll get hit by it every time
[29038.60s -> 29040.12s]  especially
[29040.12s -> 29044.22s]  okay, so um
[29044.22s -> 29048.72s]  Respawn and then go up the shortcut. I don't know why we went ball away. I don't know
[29049.52s -> 29055.69s]  I think I didn't remove my buff either. I don't know if I have one nice bald spot where
[29056.33s -> 29064.59s]  Where shouldn't have one because we both like did actual real dying. So I have a question is that always going to be uh,
[29066.73s -> 29076.16s]  Yeah
[29076.16s -> 29078.08s]  Do I have grease my check you still i'm gonna use grease
[29078.08s -> 29083.60s]  But uh, actually chat i'm using an intellect sword and it scales with arcane magic and you can't put grease on magic swords
[29084.00s -> 29088.24s]  Your vibes are off bro. When's the last time you guys hit the no. No, no someone's saying your vibes are off man
[29088.24s -> 29098.22s]  When was the last time you hit the splinky? You know, that's true. I feel better. I feel a lot better
[29098.78s -> 29100.94s]  We crushed placid axe
[29101.82s -> 29112.03s]  Flaccid man, I feel actually I feel pretty good now. What's your what's that thing's weapon art that you said you can't use
[29112.59s -> 29115.15s]  I think it's a big like earthquake. It's a big like purple earthquake
[29119.42s -> 29121.92s]  All right. Let's try it again
[29127.44s -> 29130.72s]  All right vibes are better. I feel pretty good vibes have been returned
[29132.67s -> 29134.67s]  Yo, we're just chilling
[29135.39s -> 29137.39s]  We are super
[29137.63s -> 29140.11s]  duper gamers
[29140.11s -> 29141.63s]  Just vibing out
[29141.71s -> 29146.49s]  I hurt a little bit
[29146.49s -> 29158.59s]  And no stamp you've just a bad start just a bad. No, it really was though. Like I was fine
[29158.67s -> 29161.71s]  It's just I ran out of fucking stamina and then he hit me like with his elbow
[29162.83s -> 29165.79s]  Bro hit me with his fucking elbow. Like I was fine
[29167.60s -> 29169.96s]  wrong vibe
[29169.96s -> 29172.52s]  Like I don't know. He he like he turned
[29173.24s -> 29177.64s]  and
[29177.64s -> 29199.44s]  Can we get a priest for the rez crouch into r1?
[29203.02s -> 29205.02s]  What the hell is this move?
[29206.09s -> 29208.09s]  What is this weird ass move?
[29209.40s -> 29220.86s]  Yeah, that's what cheaters use
[29220.94s -> 29225.04s]  It's so good
[29225.04s -> 29228.40s]  All right for a second. I thought this was you they they did nerf it at some point
[29228.48s -> 29233.28s]  so I don't uh the door this this fucking asshole piece of
[29234.22s -> 29237.20s]  Scum was blocking the door. I couldn't go through
[29248.80s -> 29251.76s]  The vibe was off. Make sure you rest the debuff
[29252.40s -> 29255.55s]  The vibes are fine. It's just just blocking the door
[29259.93s -> 29263.66s]  Peter griffin here. I wish you luck with the boss fight
[29264.30s -> 29281.40s]  Thanks peter
[29281.40s -> 29282.84s]  you forgot um
[29282.92s -> 29284.92s]  Family guy is sponsored in pot by
[29286.54s -> 29288.94s]  That means you're not the real peter griffin. That's how I know
[29298.40s -> 29301.60s]  All right. I'm gonna i'm gonna let's give this one more try and then
[29302.64s -> 29306.64s]  We're double bossing and I have like a plus five weapon that I can't even equip correctly
[29307.36s -> 29309.68s]  It's plus four
[29309.68s -> 29311.68s]  We are double bossing right now
[29312.48s -> 29313.77s]  That's true
[29313.77s -> 29318.73s]  Vibe check vibe check don't get locked in the corner. Be careful. Hold on. Take your time run away from the lightning
[29318.89s -> 29322.97s]  I'm not quite sure about that vibe here right now. Let me see give me a minute
[29326.97s -> 29329.29s]  Like in you're like in the fight vibes are on
[29334.28s -> 29338.12s]  Already vibes are off
[29338.12s -> 29353.04s]  Already i'm getting out of the corner
[29363.85s -> 29368.83s]  No
[29368.83s -> 29371.71s]  There's nowhere to go. You just die
[29371.71s -> 29377.87s]  Vibes were off that one. All right, if you get hit by that fire, you just die. I got hit by it
[29378.59s -> 29380.59s]  How come I got up slower than you?
[29386.09s -> 29388.01s]  The vibes were fucking terrible
[29388.01s -> 29391.10s]  kill me
[29391.10s -> 29392.86s]  I walked into it
[29392.86s -> 29397.50s]  Dude, but I can't even see what this motherfucker is doing for a move. It's like
[29402.01s -> 29404.01s]  That's been this entire fight. All right
[29405.05s -> 29412.35s]  Relax relax relax
[29412.35s -> 29414.65s]  And vibes is just killing me right?
[29421.98s -> 29425.15s]  kill me
[29425.15s -> 29427.15s]  How are you alive and you're trying to die?
[29429.36s -> 29431.52s]  I was trying a bit. I thought it was funny
[29433.88s -> 29436.44s]  I just like shook. I just shook my whole room
[29438.28s -> 29440.78s]  All right. I am doing a veto
[29441.24s -> 29443.24s]  Vibe stamp right now
[29444.00s -> 29447.92s]  Can we please do one where you don't die in like the first 10 seconds? No, the vibes are off
[29448.00s -> 29453.20s]  Okay, I legitimately think we have it if you can just like just here's what we're gonna do. Here's the strat
[29453.20s -> 29456.72s]  We're gonna run in we're gonna go up for the first 20 seconds of the boss fight
[29457.92s -> 29461.60s]  I don't want you to hit hit the boss more than one time and then just like walk away
[29461.76s -> 29468.57s]  Yeah, but I got the fucking strike twice in a row. Yeah, like do like a jump attack. Did I like shrink?
[29468.65s -> 29470.33s]  Why is this like so huge?
[29470.33s -> 29502.52s]  I'm gonna try that strategy the crouch into swing
[29503.24s -> 29507.61s]  See if it works
[29507.61s -> 29510.04s]  Is that the the heavy poke?
[29510.04s -> 29511.40s]  Yeah, like this thing
[29511.40s -> 29529.18s]  I wonder if it's behind you behind you behind you behind you he's dead. Yeah first playthrough. No spoilers, please never seen this boss
[29571.98s -> 29578.32s]  What turning animation did like a full s this worth of damage?
[29579.20s -> 29640.70s]  Okay, here we go
[29640.70s -> 29642.70s]  What the fuck is that bullshit?
[29645.02s -> 29650.06s]  I I was like so bright. Oh, wow. What a clean dodge. Oh totally boom. You're dead
[29650.78s -> 29652.78s]  Like a fucking hour later
[29652.94s -> 29655.76s]  We're gonna beat this whole thing right now watch
[29656.24s -> 29671.47s]  Not even a fucking scratch. I'm fine
[29671.47s -> 29681.55s]  Okay
[29681.55s -> 29685.63s]  That this is uh, this is way too hard for what we have right now. Let's go
[29686.03s -> 29688.27s]  I think it'll be really funny. Let's like do like a catacombs
[29688.35s -> 29692.11s]  We're gonna get to the end boss and it's gonna be like so just a guy named like charles
[29692.51s -> 29697.36s]  And we could feel good about that. I need you to rest. I'm like locked in the boss room
[29697.52s -> 29703.60s]  I need to get enough intelligence to use this weapon correctly or take the finger out of your inventory
[29704.56s -> 29711.04s]  I can't do that for you. I need to do it. I need you to do that. I need to take my finger out of your
[29712.00s -> 29714.56s]  You know, I need that it's a plus seven
[29716.14s -> 29717.18s]  Yeah
[29717.18s -> 29723.58s]  Yeah, it is it is it is like okay, like a 30 probably damage increase definitely know what?
[29724.88s -> 29725.92s]  um
[29725.92s -> 29734.03s]  So let's go to it. Let's go to one of the catacombs. Where's a good one something quick something easy
[29734.43s -> 29741.05s]  I forget where they are. I mean probably go to the artist shack and there's one around there
[29741.05s -> 29764.83s]  I forget exactly where the starting I think there is one like down here like over here. Hey, can you freak out?
[29765.23s -> 29773.04s]  No, I could also just go to that urn tree
[29774.96s -> 29779.92s]  Like like anywhere we can we can go anywhere and do anything this whole wide open world is open to us
[29780.24s -> 29784.72s]  Somebody said why do you get redder every time you die? I wonder why that is
[29786.92s -> 29790.52s]  Why would somebody get red? I just keep getting redder apparently
[29791.08s -> 29794.03s]  I know you're changing the hue on your camera
[29795.71s -> 29802.33s]  Okay, we're gonna relax going up let's just go do a dungeon go clear a boss go get me
[29803.37s -> 29807.29s]  You know another few smithing stones and all that stuff and we'll be good to go
[29807.93s -> 29811.69s]  Okay, where exactly?
[29811.77s -> 29812.65s]  I
[29812.65s -> 29817.69s]  I think there's one there's one here right like in the middle of the lake or like at the end of the lake
[29818.17s -> 29820.73s]  There's one here. Uh
[29820.73s -> 29822.73s]  Come this way
[29822.99s -> 29825.63s]  And I also down there is the the first boater
[29827.36s -> 29835.84s]  Mariner I think is relic right here. I haven't been looking at the mod chat at all. I'm sorry
[29836.48s -> 29846.81s]  I don't know. Is there anything important in here?
[29846.81s -> 29848.81s]  Lol. Yeah, we realized
[29848.81s -> 29864.52s]  I thought I did
[29864.52s -> 29866.28s]  Uh, did you go down?
[29866.28s -> 29871.95s]  Yeah, this is the pat. No, there's like a big bear in this cave. Usually
[29872.67s -> 29885.36s]  Smith and stone seven. I could probably actually upgrade my weapon quite a bit too
[29886.32s -> 29890.09s]  Like already with the stuff that I have
[29890.73s -> 29893.04s]  I just need ruins and I just need
[29893.36s -> 29895.79s]  another somber stone
[29895.95s -> 29898.03s]  I wish I could
[29898.03s -> 29899.77s]  this whole thing
[29899.77s -> 29902.59s]  Just got so twisted up
[29902.67s -> 29906.11s]  Because I put 30 points in strength because I had a fucking meltdown
[29907.23s -> 29908.43s]  I was
[29908.43s -> 29915.07s]  So excited to get that and I just used it all and it was just it was really fun. It was really exciting
[29916.84s -> 29920.32s]  I mean
[29920.32s -> 29922.08s]  It was very exciting
[29922.08s -> 29924.08s]  A lot of people would have done the same
[29924.16s -> 29931.20s]  Right now this is up to kayla dude. I'm so lost. I forget all the beginning like many areas
[29933.02s -> 29938.28s]  Um there we could also go back to castle more and fight that boss. We could probably kill it easily now
[29939.56s -> 29940.99s]  Come over here
[29940.99s -> 29943.47s]  It was the the deer. Where are you?
[29945.29s -> 29947.02s]  Uh, are you?
[29947.02s -> 29952.88s]  And there's some water village. There's a place to go down. I think this is just a boss right in here
[29957.16s -> 29963.74s]  Just uh, oh, yeah, this is where the mariner would be and then I think there also is a basement
[29964.68s -> 29969.29s]  There's a there's the gargoyle out here. I wish we could like ping
[29970.41s -> 29974.33s]  You're like I I see him. Okay, let's go get him by the gargoyle. All right
[29974.33s -> 29981.96s]  Let's go for it. It's dangerous. Get out of here tibia kindred
[29995.96s -> 29998.44s]  Uh, oh, uh, we have a bird
[29999.16s -> 30004.78s]  Oh my god, dude
[30005.02s -> 30007.34s]  Let's hear this fucking giant crow
[30009.44s -> 30012.48s]  I'm gonna pull the crow back here. He just got in the bus
[30017.96s -> 30021.08s]  You don't you dare kill me. Don't you dare kill me?
[30026.38s -> 30027.82s]  Okay, he's dead
[30027.82s -> 30036.92s]  Am I playing co-op right now? I had dude one of those giant crows came over
[30037.00s -> 30039.64s]  I that would have been the end of this whole run if I didn't kill that
[30062.51s -> 30064.51s]  Wow, he he led the target
[30074.40s -> 30076.40s]  Why can't we just kill him?
[30076.72s -> 30084.43s]  Okay
[30084.43s -> 30086.92s]  Epic, okay
[30086.92s -> 30097.04s]  Now let's go down and see what's in there. Where is it over here? Right?
[30102.89s -> 30106.33s]  I forget. I am for random items. Yeah
[30107.05s -> 30109.58s]  I think it's over here
[30109.58s -> 30114.11s]  On the other side, I think you forgot already
[30115.24s -> 30119.24s]  Yeah, I don't mean like this whole place. Look, I'm right here identical. The whole thing looks identical
[30119.80s -> 30130.96s]  Why you'd really diss the elden ring art team like that?
[30133.69s -> 30143.34s]  And it's like a little like a sugar cube on the ground to go in you thought it was coming
[30144.22s -> 30150.01s]  Getting cookbooks
[30150.01s -> 30152.76s]  Yeah, that was kind of not worth it
[30152.76s -> 30156.43s]  Well, it was content complete it progress
[30157.31s -> 30160.11s]  I didn't want to even kill that deer, but I had to
[30165.23s -> 30167.23s]  Let's go all the way down castle moore
[30167.79s -> 30178.76s]  Yeah, I need a sacred tier yesterday. I really do that would be like the number one
[30179.98s -> 30182.94s]  Best thing did you uh teleport castle mooring, right?
[30183.82s -> 30186.22s]  Um beside the rampart goal all the way at the bottom
[30187.02s -> 30188.86s]  Oh, right, right, right
[30188.86s -> 30190.65s]  um
[30190.65s -> 30194.25s]  Yeah, people thought I was gonna growl. That's why I did them. I'm gonna growl
[30194.81s -> 30210.19s]  Do you like beans and hot dogs? Yeah, that sounds amazing, dude that
[30212.43s -> 30213.95s]  It actually is really good
[30213.95s -> 30217.60s]  Okay, I haven't had one in a while. I think I got some some
[30218.48s -> 30224.16s]  Something like that. This is gonna kill me. Did you ever get that lasagna?
[30224.96s -> 30227.47s]  Uh, you're gonna get a lasagna earlier. No, no, no
[30228.75s -> 30233.93s]  No beans and hot dogs is great
[30235.87s -> 30239.26s]  Perfect. All right. We should definitely be able to do this now
[30266.04s -> 30269.79s]  Oh, come on. Really?
[30269.79s -> 30271.79s]  You're being quinge
[30272.03s -> 30274.11s]  Don't do it. Oh, he respawns here
[30275.63s -> 30276.83s]  Or not
[30276.83s -> 30277.95s]  Uh-oh
[30277.95s -> 30282.03s]  Uh, is that actual I think he's gonna actual spawn. Is he gonna suck them all up or what?
[30284.32s -> 30285.20s]  No
[30285.20s -> 30296.72s]  All right. He sucked them all up. Do they respawn? I don't think so, right?
[30297.52s -> 30299.52s]  He might have a move that spawns them
[30301.40s -> 30303.40s]  Yeah, they spawned again
[30303.40s -> 30331.45s]  I thought you died right there as I go shit. Oh my goodness. Where's the edge?

[30425.42s -> 30428.86s]  Catacombs urd tree and all the shit out there. It's just always annoying because there's like one bridge
[30429.50s -> 30431.50s]  But we can go up to
[30431.66s -> 30433.82s]  Castlemore and rampart and go west
[30436.72s -> 30439.50s]  um
[30439.50s -> 30442.24s]  I'm

[30447.23s -> 30449.23s]  Yeah, so there's a lot of shit we haven't done
[30450.04s -> 30455.40s]  Instead we're in fucking ray lucario fighting placidusax. Let's do the urd tree over here. Let's see what you said
[30462.24s -> 30466.86s]  And then are you how are you feeling are you all right? I feel like I should probably honestly I was up
[30467.26s -> 30471.74s]  Until five a.m. Last night. So like i'm i'm a little bit goofed
[30472.46s -> 30475.77s]  um

[30482.41s -> 30484.41s]  But like who cares?
[30484.89s -> 30486.27s]  Am I right?
[30486.27s -> 30493.90s]  I mean am I right we can always just like I don't take a day take a day or two and come back on like monday
[30493.90s -> 30496.32s]  Or it's a tuesday or something
[30496.32s -> 30497.84s]  And I thought we're gonna play tomorrow
[30497.84s -> 30500.08s]  Yeah, but if it's like you're up too late and you want to go to the gym and stuff
[30500.96s -> 30504.96s]  I like have to go early no matter what. Oh, it's not it's not a it's not a whole thing. Okay
[30509.66s -> 30512.38s]  I rescheduled the gymming already
[30518.91s -> 30520.91s]  Uh, I definitely want to eat food though
[30521.39s -> 30527.63s]  So whatever like a boss or two. Yeah, I don't know set like a milestone and then we'll stop and we can play tomorrow
[30527.71s -> 30529.31s]  Let's fight a boss
[30529.31s -> 30531.44s]  get some
[30531.44s -> 30533.28s]  You know ruins
[30533.28s -> 30536.96s]  Because it has been eight and a half hours and i'm hungry. This is uh
[30537.52s -> 30540.88s]  The demi god, I don't know if you count that is that does this count? Yeah
[30542.35s -> 30543.55s]  this counts
[30543.55s -> 30560.99s]  What time do you want to start tomorrow?
[30560.99s -> 30562.67s]  What is this counts?
[30562.67s -> 30565.31s]  Um, are you sure it's kind of like five bosses in here
[30565.87s -> 30568.22s]  No, man
[30568.22s -> 30576.24s]  Actually, I guess because bosses can I was thinking that it would be an actual a boss but it doesn't necessarily have to be a boss
[30576.72s -> 30580.64s]  All right, the the it's the bear. Yeah, the rune bear is a boss shit down
[30582.46s -> 30585.18s]  Is it I think the rune bear is technically a boss, right?
[30587.55s -> 30591.07s]  I didn't think so
[30591.07s -> 30595.24s]  That's i'm a human. I'm playing with you. I was trying to hit you
[30599.92s -> 30602.97s]  Okay, what's the deal?

[30617.50s -> 30619.50s]  All right, fine. There's not even a fog gate
[30625.56s -> 30627.32s]  It's patchwork a boss
[30627.32s -> 30631.60s]  Does that count?
[30631.60s -> 30633.42s]  I mean
[30633.42s -> 30637.84s]  Now isn't there a way to go down here though?
[30640.80s -> 30644.00s]  Yeah, no, there's like a chest but it's in a weird like hidden spot
[30646.49s -> 30648.49s]  There's actually wait, hold on
[30650.73s -> 30654.57s]  There's like we're surrounded by caves right now there's like a lot we can do
[30657.08s -> 30658.38s]  not

[30685.47s -> 30689.69s]  You won't just pull the plug now and just come back. No, there's one there's a cave around here, dude
[30689.69s -> 30690.73s]  I know it

[30818.99s -> 30821.07s]  My flask actually now will be pretty good. I think

[30859.52s -> 30862.75s]  Okay

[30972.83s -> 30975.52s]  He's in the volcano
[30975.52s -> 30979.76s]  So I can't imagine the volcano. Oh spinning around like that. I think he is in the volcano
[30991.69s -> 30993.69s]  I haven't been able to get over near him
[31014.12s -> 31016.12s]  He also has phase two
[31019.68s -> 31027.92s]  Done still like a fucking monster hunter like we're just like hunt the same monster all stream
[31029.92s -> 31035.12s]  Oh, I come on dude, like i'm so close to my like dragon plate armor. We're doing like one more magma worm
[31041.28s -> 31046.73s]  All right. Nice
[31046.73s -> 31048.73s]  Only 3,600 but whatever
[31049.92s -> 31052.40s]  Letter to patches and ronin's armor
[31054.99s -> 31058.99s]  Okay, let's teleport back to the church. I want to see one thing and then it's done
[31059.55s -> 31061.66s]  the church
[31061.66s -> 31064.30s]  Yeah, that we just came from church of pilgrimage right above us
[31068.70s -> 31070.08s]  All right
[31070.08s -> 31071.52s]  so we'll do
[31071.52s -> 31073.52s]  What one o'clock two two o'clock tomorrow pacific?
[31074.24s -> 31075.92s]  One or two i'll be around just message me
[31076.00s -> 31079.52s]  I don't know if you want to make like a solid schedule so people know but like well
[31079.52s -> 31082.88s]  We don't we're not gonna we're not gonna run into the technical bullshit. So let's start at one
[31083.90s -> 31085.90s]  Okay, I will be back probably by
[31086.46s -> 31091.63s]  Let me think i'll be back two hours before that. That's fine
[31096.84s -> 31099.24s]  Yeah, I um
[31099.24s -> 31102.68s]  Yeah, we started one that we can it won't be too late if we go a long time
[31107.55s -> 31110.09s]  Cool
[31110.09s -> 31113.29s]  I forgot how you use the cookbooks was the thing I wanted to look at
[31113.85s -> 31117.77s]  I thought you did that at I think I think you just have them now
[31118.80s -> 31120.80s]  If you because it's crafting shit
[31120.96s -> 31126.32s]  So we never got the crafting thing to do any crafting. Oh, yeah, you need an item to craft. Yeah
[31127.04s -> 31131.36s]  Okay. Well, yeah, because I think the crafting things that you craft are also randomized
[31131.36s -> 31138.68s]  You would like spend a whole bunch of weird stuff to get weird thing and i've got a lot of weird stuff
[31139.16s -> 31144.44s]  Anyway, yeah, that was good. Good fun. Good night. I think we'll I mean, I don't know if we'll beat it tomorrow
[31144.44s -> 31152.83s]  But I think we'll probably get the least past very lucaria and it threw um, we made some pretty good progress
[31152.83s -> 31158.24s]  Look at we look at how long look at this. We did pretty good. I banish you
[31165.26s -> 31166.54s]  Yeah, we'll start at one
[31166.54s -> 31173.13s]  The hardest part is always an elden ring like gearing up in the beginning. Well, I mean randomizer doesn't make it any easier
[31173.90s -> 31177.34s]  Yeah, I mean there's like the tricks you could do where you go kill the giant dragon and you know
[31177.34s -> 31183.61s]  Wow, I got all those souls and everyone like claps. Yeah, I'd rather that i'd rather just suck
[31184.09s -> 31186.09s]  absolute asshole at the game and
[31186.97s -> 31192.44s]  Mess up two or three builds in a row and I think it's more fun that way. That's what i'm saying
[31192.52s -> 31200.08s]  Anyway, i'll see you i'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye stir. Bye and
[31200.64s -> 31207.20s]  Goodbye to all of you kind of a meaty one today. I don't know if we're gonna do
[31208.86s -> 31213.50s]  A I can't tell you this is gonna be a nine-hour stream tomorrow, but we'll play it
[31213.50s -> 31219.42s]  We'll go for a little while as long as we can. Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you tomorrow
[31219.66s -> 31224.40s]  I'm very very hungry and i'm very tired. I'm kind of kind of uh
[31224.96s -> 31232.28s]  Zonked out right now, but that was a lot of fun. I was scared that it wasn't gonna work that well
[31234.78s -> 31252.72s]  But it actually works very very well. Appreciate you hanging out very very late for a lot of you. I am going to
[31254.54s -> 31262.09s]  Eat food and go right to bed
[31262.09s -> 31262.33s]  All right
[31262.33s -> 31268.20s]  First order of business tomorrow when the stream starts is I have to do I need to find a smithing stone five
[31269.69s -> 31283.61s]  And I gotta put points into intelligence. That's what we're doing. You needed a typing test. Oh, that's right
[31284.01s -> 31293.26s]  I'll bring it up tomorrow to him. Elden Ring is always a blast even though it's kind of a frustrating mess sometimes
[31293.26s -> 31296.20s]  But it's always fun
[31296.20s -> 31300.84s]  There was two or three potential growl attempts and I stopped them and you saw my face
[31300.84s -> 31316.97s]  I looked over and I put a stop to it. Nah, I'll uh, i'll see you tomorrow. Good night everybody. Take care of yourselves drink a
[31318.09s -> 31327.28s]  I can't even talk. It's just a glass of water. Call your mother. You know the deal. See you guys later
