[7.42s -> 34.39s]  Hello. Let me quit this game. I need to change the title to Last Hero of Nostalgia.
[34.39s -> 65.59s]  So I do nostalgia and then like comma bat chest. Is that good? Is that, is that, nah.
[65.59s -> 79.86s]  Last Hero of Nostalgia. How about, no, I don't want to encourage bat chests unless I say it.
[80.60s -> 91.62s]  How about nostalgia? Let's game. Whatever, I don't care. Nostalgia. Let's game. Who gives a shit.
[91.62s -> 115.05s]  That's arguably worse than the bat chest title. Okay, just give me two seconds. Yeah, sponsor's
[115.05s -> 146.66s]  over. I'm probably going to keep playing that game. That was really fun. All right. What was
[146.66s -> 183.67s]  the last thing I did here? Hold on. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[183.67s -> 209.86s]  There it is. There you go. You can have it for a little longer. Just for a little bit longer.
[209.86s -> 218.22s]  All right. Now I have to do the fun thing called it. The buttons are completely different in this
[218.22s -> 228.07s]  game. So it's not X, Y. It's R1, R2. This is going to mess me up. If I lose in the first 10 minutes,
[228.07s -> 237.80s]  it doesn't count. Yeah, you can take the timer off for the sponsor. Oh, I should probably take
[237.80s -> 247.62s]  up though. Let me do this real quick too. Hold on. Let me just take the panel out. Give me one
[247.62s -> 261.24s]  second. I'm glad I'm doing this now because the last time I did a sponsor, I believe, I wonder,
[261.24s -> 266.76s]  I think it was Gotham Knights. I left the panel there I think for like three weeks. It was kind
[266.76s -> 290.33s]  of ridiculous. All right. There we go. It should be good to go. Yep. Let's begin. Base came in the
[290.33s -> 299.59s]  bottom right. Probably a good idea. All right. Let's keep going. If you don't know what this
[299.59s -> 307.69s]  game is, this game is Last Hero Nostalgia. It's like a parody Dark Souls game. It's very good.
[307.69s -> 322.20s]  It's very good. Almost surprisingly so. We're all really into it. Watch this. All right. What
[322.28s -> 333.67s]  was the last thing? I was going to go up, right? There's like two ways to go. I forget where I was
[333.67s -> 348.46s]  going. And remember, I know it was literally yesterday, but you know what I mean? Like it's
[349.02s -> 368.07s]  processing info can be difficult sometimes. Wasn't it? Was it a big theater room? I feel
[368.07s -> 385.10s]  like it's this way. I think this is right. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah. I got to get used to
[385.10s -> 393.13s]  the controls. I told you that one didn't count. I pressed it. I pressed X. That one doesn't count.
[393.21s -> 397.77s]  That one doesn't count. I have to read. I'm not throwing for content. I've got to learn.
[398.81s -> 416.25s]  It's R1, R2. You understand? Tell that to the judge. I'm documented here. I'm documented.
[416.25s -> 433.91s]  Okay. Let me just run around for a sec. I think it's this. Yep. Okay. This is where I want to go,
[433.91s -> 454.31s]  I think. Is it? I genuinely don't remember. No. Like in my brain right now is Wild Hearts. And
[454.31s -> 457.67s]  I'm like, oh, that area with the coral. It's like, this is a, this is a, this is, this game
[457.67s -> 470.98s]  is not in my brain right now. Like where the hell am I? Never happened to you guys when you just
[470.98s -> 475.06s]  play a game and you just like leave it and you leave it in a spot. You know, here's the problem.
[475.06s -> 479.93s]  I left it in a spot that wasn't like right at a boss door. So like I'm still in this area,
[479.93s -> 490.12s]  but I like to have no idea where I am. Anybody else happen to happen to you? Like if I was in
[490.12s -> 507.70s]  front of a boss door, it's like, oh, okay. Right. Here we are. Once I get it, I'll get it. So many
[507.70s -> 519.19s]  things to burn into memory because it's down here. I remember this because this is where the
[519.19s -> 529.82s]  wizard guy was. And then through here and then through here, I remember finding the pot head
[529.82s -> 551.35s]  person. And I think that was where it ended. I think because then this leads, I don't know.
[551.35s -> 560.39s]  No, this guy, this goes back down to that other area. What about over here? I don't think I've
[560.39s -> 584.71s]  gone. No, I have not gone this way. All right. Perfect. Let's go. Welcome to the stream. Oh,
[585.51s -> 595.34s]  this is, this really is like the whole game is connected. Okay. So now I can be here. Any
[595.34s -> 608.50s]  memories? All right. So that's a shortcut to get back here. I swear to God, there was a place I
[608.50s -> 643.91s]  could go up. Stivity row. There's a boss here and I need help in there. Like, should I go up all the
[643.91s -> 660.73s]  way? Cause that's the, let me go up. You look mad. No, it's a little confused. I don't want to say
[660.73s -> 677.21s]  I'm angry. I just don't remember this one door that I, I remember I walked by it like five times
[677.21s -> 713.91s]  before here. No, does anybody like remember? No, no. Top of the tower. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[713.91s -> 721.08s]  It's here. It's right here. It's right here. All right. So I go down here. Yep. I got it.
[721.08s -> 729.83s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Cause then I go down here and I can walk
[729.83s -> 747.14s]  up another side. Don't even please. I'll never get back here again. Please do not kill me.
[747.14s -> 761.22s]  All right. Here it is. Right. And then it was right out the fucking door. All right. Everybody
[761.22s -> 770.17s]  relax. Everybody just chill. It was literally right next to us. It was right next to us the
[770.17s -> 780.90s]  whole time. I come, I forgot I opened this door. Everybody just chill out. Everything's good.
[782.30s -> 797.26s]  Now we just sit down. I'm doing a luck build. If you didn't know. All right. There we go. Right,
[797.26s -> 816.54s]  right, right, right. And then this goes down here. We don't touch this. We come out this way.
[819.78s -> 844.36s]  And we look over here and then we turn around and we go back down and then we go up and then
[844.36s -> 871.11s]  we go up. No, I didn't press it again. Whatever. Give me some fucking water. And then we go down
[871.11s -> 888.09s]  and then we go up. Here it is. It just took a few minutes to get back into the swing of things.
[888.09s -> 906.34s]  Yeah. And then we go down the elevator. Evil. What do you want? You want, get away from me.
[906.34s -> 948.58s]  Get away from me. Get away from me. Big hit. Me crit. Dude, you healed this BM. Don't you know?
[952.22s -> 967.62s]  Okay. What did that do? This dude's spamming projectiles. Hey, I'm playing to win. And now
[967.62s -> 999.69s]  we go down the elevator. I actually think we don't. Where do I actually go? I thought that
[999.69s -> 1014.97s]  was the progress route. It's not maybe this way. I don't know. Yeah. Cause this is back here.
[1014.97s -> 1025.86s]  I've been here before. Watch the VOD. I mean, I thought going up there was progress. It's not
[1025.86s -> 1048.76s]  through the bucket headway. You went into the staff rooms last time. Um, so that was,
[1048.76s -> 1062.55s]  wasn't that behind the wizard room with the old man? I was just in there though. I gotta go back
[1062.55s -> 1075.06s]  into the... I just wish I wasn't so fucking confused right now. I could go down here.
[1075.06s -> 1088.89s]  I don't think that helps though. It is a very big map. It actually is. Where is game progress
[1088.89s -> 1102.54s]  though? And how do I get there quickly? Just jump it. Now that, that's like the two zones ago.
[1102.54s -> 1107.42s]  Cause going down past the wizard guy was where that pothead was. And I went through there and
[1107.42s -> 1115.37s]  that just is a shortcut back to one of the first areas. I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.
[1115.37s -> 1136.82s]  There was a flickering door in the very first area. I don't know. I would imagine it would have
[1136.82s -> 1145.53s]  been here. Maybe back in the... God, I don't know. It was the boss that you said you'd save later.
[1145.53s -> 1148.26s]  Yeah. That's what I thought we were doing. I thought, oh, I'm going to go up these stairs.
[1148.26s -> 1151.38s]  There's the boss. And then we keep going. But that was not what happened. Now I don't know
[1151.38s -> 1186.12s]  what to do. It's going to start over. Cause like, this is the shortcut to go down here,
[1186.12s -> 1210.25s]  which I was already here. Maybe, maybe it is this way. I don't know. That's where I came in.
[1210.33s -> 1222.25s]  Say please and I'll tell you please. In here, I went down there. That's just a shortcut. Can
[1222.25s -> 1225.29s]  I go anywhere else behind? I know I'm just monologuing the entire thing I'm doing,
[1225.29s -> 1235.75s]  but I'm trying to process where the hell I am. Okay. This is where the wizard was. This just
[1235.75s -> 1262.52s]  goes back to the second area. Where the hell am I? That left door? The left door is a shortcut.
[1262.52s -> 1275.29s]  This goes back down to that, isn't it? Cause this comes up here. We were up here before.
[1275.93s -> 1303.59s]  This is the quest reward place. I don't think this is right. I remember this. This is it. How
[1303.59s -> 1307.59s]  did I get so turned around then? Didn't I leave, didn't I leave this area that goes down to the
[1307.59s -> 1333.64s]  depths? Oh, hello. Wow. These vaults once held rewards for our heroes. Having restored our good
[1333.64s -> 1341.80s]  king, a hero returned to a procession and, uh, and play honoring their deeds. We would give them our
[1342.44s -> 1350.68s]  most beautiful crafts, not for fighting, just tokens of our adoration, our veneration. Of course,
[1350.68s -> 1356.04s]  their story wasn't yet over then. There was still the kidnapping during the festivities. Oh,
[1356.04s -> 1361.64s]  good times. Still don't master Smith. Right there. Hit him. But I might be able to try some more
[1361.64s -> 1369.98s]  complex enhancements. More complex enhancements. All right. Am I, am I doing the cane? Yes or no?
[1369.98s -> 1395.40s]  Cane? Yes or no? Is that stupid? I don't have any other weapons to really try.
[1395.96s -> 1414.81s]  I'm all right for now. Whoa. What does this do? Two, one, 99 to plus 182.
[1415.53s -> 1431.32s]  648. What is this doing? This is fucking crazy. Is it scaling with decks more? I mean, I feel like
[1431.32s -> 1441.75s]  I'm just going to have to do this. I'm doing it. I can't see anything. Thank you for giving me a
[1441.75s -> 1460.31s]  purpose. Is it worse? I don't know. I think that's better. 281. It was not 281 before. All right.
[1460.31s -> 1474.73s]  Cool. Thank you. I remember this. Let's fight this. Let's see how much more damage. That's
[1474.73s -> 1478.73s]  fucking ridiculous. That is ridiculous. That's like, I just cut him for almost this entire health
[1478.73s -> 1544.20s]  pool. That was epic. Goodbye. Clean it up. Yep. There's the fridge. Oh, no. Attack him from behind.
[1544.20s -> 1553.91s]  Hurry up. That's a lot of fucking people. My computer just almost crashed. I killed them
[1553.91s -> 1565.35s]  so bad that my computer almost broke. Yeah. Oh, yep. Yep. All right. All right. All right. All
[1565.35s -> 1571.32s]  right. All right. I remember this then through here. This is where I stopped streaming. Okay.
[1572.14s -> 1577.26s]  All right. Nice. Yes. Everything is good to go. This is exactly. I remember stopping. I'm going to
[1577.26s -> 1595.56s]  stop right here. Always stop before a boss. Don't ever stop in the middle of a fight. Pull it up.
[1595.56s -> 1635.94s]  Oh my God. I got stuck. You guys are on the same team. Oh, fuck. This is bad. Hello? Coward strat.
[1635.94s -> 1651.56s]  It just has to work. It just has to work. Look, if you and I did the same thing and you died there
[1651.56s -> 1672.25s]  and I won, I continue to play. You have to start over. I hope it's worth it. Crucible.
[1676.12s -> 1693.08s]  And I can remember it. I just want to look at it. Strength, unfortunately. So that's not going to
[1693.08s -> 1711.96s]  work. But I am going to. Should I just remember everything? Why not? Right. It's 3000. That's 3k.
[1711.96s -> 1725.16s]  It's not worth it. No, it's not worth it. I'm not going to use it. So this thing is really cool,
[1725.16s -> 1746.28s]  though. Finally, progress. NPC city. Leisure Lake. Can't get in there. Stivity row. No. Kitchen.
[1746.28s -> 1754.17s]  Who's your favorite Ice Age character? I'm personally quite partial to Scrat. Um,
[1754.87s -> 1779.10s]  what's the tiger's name? Not that one. What's the mammoth's name? Manny. This is kind of creepy.
[1779.10s -> 1800.34s]  The kitchen. Wait. OK, there we go. Uh, I can level up. Am I just, am I actually just going
[1800.34s -> 1808.92s]  full on just luck build? Is that stupid? Well, definitely get that. What's the new ability?
[1808.92s -> 1832.31s]  Stamina recovery when low. Keep memory on death is kind of hysterical. Not bad. Oh,
[1832.31s -> 1836.55s]  it is worth remembering because you, the more that you remember, the more shit you unlock. Yeah,
[1836.55s -> 1845.13s]  that's worth doing. No matter. Yeah, it is actually. Yeah, you get, uh, the upgrades.
[1845.13s -> 1859.18s]  It's cool. You can unlock the lore. Yeah. The one guy in chat that said it's worth doing.
[1859.18s -> 1881.86s]  We need to listen to that person more often. Irrelevant appendage. Another strength weapon.
[1881.86s -> 1894.49s]  Just an arm. OK, continue. So just a TLDR. Those that weren't here last night. The game has a
[1894.49s -> 1899.61s]  feature where you have to go to the place that the weapon remembers somewhere in the world or the
[1899.61s -> 1905.53s]  armor armor too. And you need to be aware of it. You should be checking it pretty frequently. Um,
[1906.41s -> 1913.37s]  the way the game is on, uh, PC is on Steam. The narrator had taken to scathing others in his
[1913.37s -> 1928.34s]  duress. Sudden forget it. What? Don't poop a pixel. I think that's kind of a bad thing.
[1935.34s -> 1946.52s]  Player housing. Approach the banquet table. Surely there was no hope. That's a crazy looking
[1946.52s -> 1963.29s]  castle. Curiosity, but void. Wow. Interesting. Damn, bro. That's crazy. Oh, it's our friend.
[1965.13s -> 1971.75s]  We've been doing this person's quest since we started, so I'm very curious. Hello. Together,
[1971.75s -> 1989.35s]  my friend, we shall mean that thing. What if he dies? Wait, um, yes, let's do it. Yes. Yes.
[1989.99s -> 2001.62s]  Let me get this item first and then we'll go. That's another trinket. All right. This is
[2001.62s -> 2020.79s]  definitely a boss. How many heels do I have? I got four. Four. Are you coming? Come and help me.
[2029.94s -> 2077.32s]  Wait, follow. Let's go. What's this deal? Statue this guy out in the first area.
[2077.32s -> 2108.58s]  Nom. Oh my goodness. That's a big combo. Give me a crit. All right. Back it up. Back it up. Back
[2108.58s -> 2130.46s]  it up. Don't be stupid. Oh, that. Ow. Oh my God. This guy is goofy. I'm dead. That was goofy. That
[2130.46s -> 2142.30s]  was really goofy. Just like them. I like this boss. What's your opinion on tums? Uh, don't
[2142.30s -> 2152.55s]  overdo it. Tums are a temporary solution to a potential deeper problem. And why am I? What am
[2152.55s -> 2163.72s]  I doing? Yeah, don't, don't abuse it. If you're having acid reflux, if you're having lots of like
[2163.72s -> 2169.50s]  GERD problems, uh, you definitely should probably look into it and not just like pop tums, tums,
[2169.50s -> 2177.74s]  tums, tums, tums every day. There's some medication that can help that stuff. There's also
[2177.74s -> 2182.44s]  lifestyle changes. Like it might be some food that you're eating. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a
[2182.44s -> 2193.77s]  doctor. So I don't know. If we talked to a doctor, they would probably be better than me. All right.
[2193.77s -> 2209.26s]  Let's go together. My friend has, I thought he was a doctor. Oh shit. That's why I'm here.
[2210.14s -> 2246.25s]  All right. This, this guy's hard. Oh, all right. He's going to go dance. Free hits, free hits,
[2270.33s -> 2287.22s]  dance, dancing, dancing. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, is a clone.
[2338.70s -> 2371.85s]  This music is fucking crazy. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2371.85s -> 2397.02s]  bro. I ain't even looking anymore. See you later. Nice fight. Tom's dancing pole. And what else?
[2397.02s -> 2410.84s]  That was something else. You're wicked lame. I completed the encounter. Did you see that?
[2410.84s -> 2417.32s]  Did you see that? I went swoosh slash stab at a stab at a stab.
[2419.40s -> 2419.88s]  Echo.
[2419.88s -> 2423.48s]  I am the greatest. We are.
[2423.48s -> 2425.40s]  Nice job.
[2425.40s -> 2429.32s]  We're awesome. We're awesome.
[2430.12s -> 2442.89s]  Thanks for the help. Okay. I got a couple of things I want to look at. Oh, strength. I forgot
[2442.89s -> 2471.11s]  to blink. Decreases stamina usage. What did I pick up? It was like a red annoying enemy ahead,
[2471.11s -> 2503.66s]  but try quick attacks. I went the wrong way. That was the boss room. Warning. Classic David.
[2503.66s -> 2507.91s]  Oh, David. Come on, David. Get it together.
[2508.47s -> 2524.66s]  The narrator felt nostalgia cascaded over the narrator.
[2524.66s -> 2542.90s]  Oh, that was kind of funny. Oh, it's a I can another blast. Any memories?
[2542.90s -> 2546.58s]  Path of the Good Monarch. You carry one relic that can be remembered ahead.
[2546.58s -> 2563.56s]  I like this zone. This lady just attacked me. What's your deal?
[2563.56s -> 2566.07s]  Put down my art, please.
[2567.16s -> 2570.73s]  R1, R1, R1, R1.
[2570.73s -> 2573.85s]  You might have taken this as an opportunity to dispatch me.
[2573.85s -> 2574.25s]  True.
[2574.25s -> 2580.57s]  Perhaps I misjudged you originally. I am. Well, you may call me.
[2583.37s -> 2588.57s]  My name has no meaning. Call me Vengeance.
[2588.57s -> 2593.37s]  I watched you approach the consumer's banquet. You read Nostalgair of his gluttony.
[2593.93s -> 2597.13s]  By chance, our paths are aligned.
[2598.09s -> 2601.77s]  Across this canyon lies the keep of the stolen crown.
[2601.77s -> 2604.33s]  A great one has usurped its throne.
[2604.33s -> 2607.21s]  I will purge this kingdom of all that strangle it.
[2608.25s -> 2610.14s]  Can I have your weapon?
[2610.86s -> 2615.75s]  Though I do not recognize your story, I do know your make.
[2615.75s -> 2621.50s]  You were one of them, yet also somehow less than them.
[2621.50s -> 2625.34s]  And I suspect in some way even less than me.
[2625.98s -> 2627.26s]  You all thought I was going to do it?
[2627.26s -> 2629.10s]  I mean, none of this is an insult.
[2629.10s -> 2632.38s]  Your peculiarity may be the thing that saves you from their fate.
[2633.58s -> 2635.58s]  Hey, dude. Little Caesar's pretzel crust is back.
[2636.46s -> 2638.38s]  Are you kidding me, dude?
[2638.38s -> 2641.98s]  I wish you well on your quest, so long as it is true.
[2641.98s -> 2642.86s]  Should you falter?
[2642.86s -> 2643.74s]  I will kill you.
[2644.86s -> 2646.78s]  Not before I kill you first.
[2649.48s -> 2653.56s]  We already had an encounter, and I distinctly remember winning that one.
[2654.20s -> 2659.54s]  I will kill you while you stand,
[2659.54s -> 2664.58s]  except you kicked the ever-living shit out of me 10 minutes ago.
[2664.58s -> 2665.78s]  It wasn't even a contest.
[2665.78s -> 2667.78s]  You kicked the shit out of me.
[2667.78s -> 2671.30s]  But I will kill you if you screw this up at all.
[2671.30s -> 2672.02s]  I'm watching you.
[2674.71s -> 2675.75s]  Is there anything else I can do over there?
[2681.83s -> 2682.39s]  Nope.
[2682.39s -> 2684.95s]  All right, goodbye.
[2684.95s -> 2695.00s]  Why did he add, hey, dude, to that random pizza crust message?
[2695.56s -> 2700.22s]  I don't know, because I...
[2701.34s -> 2702.46s]  All right.
[2702.46s -> 2706.54s]  I read it, and then I process it, and then the chat is moving so fast sometimes.
[2706.78s -> 2710.82s]  That I have to repurpose it, and it's kind of...
[2710.82s -> 2712.74s]  It's like, hey, it's gone.
[2713.30s -> 2717.62s]  Okay, let me repurpose it and get the gist of what that person was saying.
[2717.62s -> 2723.94s]  Suddenly, and for no reason at all, and without implying any third-party emotional investment,
[2723.94s -> 2726.02s]  hope bridged the divide.
[2733.69s -> 2736.62s]  Wait, that was a clue.
[2736.62s -> 2737.42s]  It was a clue.
[2744.78s -> 2745.66s]  The blue shell.
[2746.22s -> 2754.73s]  A carapace from a road-crossing beast that could knock a carriage off its course.
[2754.73s -> 2759.98s]  The narrator was the most exuberant cheerleader in all of Nastal Gaia.
[2759.98s -> 2763.26s]  His belief in the institution of heroism was unwavering.
[2763.26s -> 2765.82s]  To conduct the hero's journey and articulate its wonder,
[2765.82s -> 2768.70s]  the narrator wielded his immense power over Source.
[2768.70s -> 2773.75s]  Nobody thought much about Source back then, where it came from or what it was.
[2773.75s -> 2777.11s]  Magic was simply accepted as part of the code of existence.
[2777.11s -> 2779.19s]  After the degradation began,
[2779.67s -> 2783.99s]  some who were never meant to access Source began harnessing it through unconventional means.
[2783.99s -> 2788.46s]  At first, the narrator tried to believe that this was...
[2788.46s -> 2790.98s]  This too was part of a greater plan.
[2790.98s -> 2792.47s]  This forbidden use...
[2793.51s -> 2796.71s]  Everything is fucked up, and it was called a glitch.
[2796.71s -> 2801.77s]  But how good is it?
[2801.77s -> 2807.02s]  I'm about to just put that in my main hand.
[2807.02s -> 2811.56s]  No, I can't.
[2811.56s -> 2812.44s]  70%?
[2812.44s -> 2812.84s]  32?
[2812.84s -> 2815.64s]  Oh, it's a magic defense shield.
[2815.64s -> 2819.77s]  Might need it later.
[2819.77s -> 2824.38s]  You look like Freddy Fazbear.
[2825.50s -> 2830.50s]  What are you gonna say now?
[2837.98s -> 2839.66s]  Warlock's Wilds.
[2839.66s -> 2851.08s]  I need a bonfire.
[2851.08s -> 2851.56s]  Nope.
[2851.56s -> 2852.12s]  It's this guy.
[2872.44s -> 2874.28s]  I don't think I want to unburden anything.
[2874.28s -> 2876.14s]  I could unburden the...
[2878.10s -> 2878.82s]  That's not worth it.
[2878.82s -> 2879.30s]  I don't care.
[2886.33s -> 2886.97s]  Stop.
[2886.97s -> 2887.93s]  Stop, Jerma.
[2887.93s -> 2888.25s]  Stop.
[2889.83s -> 2890.55s]  Right?
[2890.55s -> 2891.35s]  There it is.
[2891.35s -> 2892.73s]  Yep.
[2892.73s -> 2893.29s]  I...
[2893.29s -> 2893.61s]  Yep.
[2893.61s -> 2894.25s]  There it is.
[2894.25s -> 2895.61s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[2904.63s -> 2907.54s]  Keep the non an NPC.
[2911.13s -> 2912.25s]  Smile while they hit you.
[2912.81s -> 2913.48s]  All right.
[2913.48s -> 2913.72s]  Hold on.
[2913.72s -> 2914.44s]  Was it her?
[2914.44s -> 2926.98s]  It's probably another shortcut.
[2927.54s -> 2936.55s]  Oh, it's...
[2936.55s -> 2936.95s]  No.
[2936.95s -> 2937.19s]  Okay.
[2937.19s -> 2937.83s]  I thought I pulled it.
[2938.47s -> 2939.53s]  I looked over at chat.
[2952.98s -> 2953.30s]  God.
[2953.94s -> 2955.22s]  I don't want to die down here.
[2955.22s -> 2971.03s]  I was in another area.
[2971.03s -> 2977.69s]  Blade the Bold's withered icon.
[2977.69s -> 2978.17s]  Oh, shit.
[2978.17s -> 2979.69s]  That's another flask.
[2979.69s -> 2996.74s]  Somebody asked a long time ago if I recommend this game.
[2996.74s -> 2998.78s]  The answer is absolutely yes.
[2998.78s -> 3000.62s]  Good game design ahead.
[3000.62s -> 3001.26s]  Let's find out.
[3022.23s -> 3022.55s]  Okay.
[3022.55s -> 3023.83s]  So it's through this gate.
[3023.83s -> 3024.82s]  Nice.
[3024.82s -> 3033.66s]  This game seems way more fleshed out than it needs to be.
[3035.66s -> 3037.02s]  It's really surprising.
[3037.02s -> 3037.58s]  I thought this...
[3037.58s -> 3039.42s]  I honestly thought this was going to split it like a joke.
[3039.42s -> 3048.44s]  I mean, the game is a parody kind of gaming and Dark Souls and whatever, right?
[3048.44s -> 3061.51s]  But on its own, it's very, very fun.
[3061.51s -> 3062.47s]  20 health, probably?
[3062.47s -> 3062.95s]  Yeah.
[3062.95s -> 3072.54s]  I have a lot of crunchies that I have not used, don't I?
[3072.54s -> 3073.42s]  I do.
[3073.42s -> 3087.24s]  I don't think this is going to get me there.
[3087.24s -> 3093.42s]  What do I need?
[3093.42s -> 3094.79s]  8,000?
[3094.79s -> 3098.33s]  9,000?
[3098.33s -> 3098.73s]  Six.
[3098.73s -> 3099.05s]  Okay.
[3104.70s -> 3105.02s]  Yeah.
[3105.02s -> 3107.26s]  Get health to 20 and then I'm going to move on.
[3107.26s -> 3110.78s]  But are you made of breadsticks?
[3110.78s -> 3117.85s]  Have I got any new gear?
[3117.85s -> 3120.57s]  I think it's time for some change of clothes.
[3120.57s -> 3129.30s]  This is 1710.
[3129.30s -> 3137.72s]  I like that bat roll.
[3137.72s -> 3140.57s]  Never mind.
[3140.57s -> 3144.50s]  Bat roll.
[3153.64s -> 3154.76s]  The shiny is fine.
[3154.76s -> 3156.54s]  I'd like to upgrade it.
[3156.54s -> 3158.46s]  I'd like to find the remembrance, whatever it is.
[3158.46s -> 3160.22s]  All right.
[3160.22s -> 3160.78s]  Let's move.
[3160.78s -> 3172.78s]  Somebody said, what was more painful, Jump King or Millennia?
[3172.78s -> 3176.87s]  I...
[3176.87s -> 3180.84s]  Jump King was sustained horror.
[3180.84s -> 3185.74s]  Millennia was bursts of horror.
[3185.74s -> 3186.46s]  I don't know.
[3186.46s -> 3194.07s]  Because one is extreme, vast, awful horror.
[3194.07s -> 3199.72s]  And the other one is just like a slow drip of just pain and suffering.
[3199.72s -> 3202.66s]  One happens really quickly and the other one is...
[3202.66s -> 3203.14s]  I don't know.
[3203.14s -> 3204.02s]  They're both bad.
[3204.02s -> 3208.76s]  But goddamn, they're fun.
[3208.76s -> 3210.78s]  I will never play the Jump King DLC.
[3210.78s -> 3211.96s]  No.
[3211.96s -> 3212.28s]  Never.
[3212.28s -> 3212.76s]  Ever.
[3212.76s -> 3217.77s]  That is one thing I can guarantee you I would never do.
[3217.77s -> 3225.24s]  It's never going to happen.
[3225.24s -> 3229.64s]  I watched the pain and suffering of people playing through the DLC.
[3229.64s -> 3233.02s]  Just like, no.
[3233.02s -> 3252.50s]  New tether.
[3252.50s -> 3256.33s]  Nothing glowing.
[3256.33s -> 3263.59s]  Stick to the path.
[3263.59s -> 3264.63s]  Danger ahead.
[3264.63s -> 3266.94s]  Step carefully.
[3266.94s -> 3269.05s]  Tell me what the fuck to do.
[3269.05s -> 3287.38s]  Tale of Luck.
[3287.38s -> 3289.30s]  What's that?
[3289.30s -> 3293.30s]  It's a different weapon upgrade.
[3293.30s -> 3295.69s]  There's a lot of weapon upgrade material.
[3295.69s -> 3297.98s]  I feel like there's only three types of weapons.
[3297.98s -> 3301.69s]  And we've seen like more than three upgrade materials.
[3301.69s -> 3302.73s]  Oh shit.
[3302.73s -> 3318.68s]  Why did that...
[3318.68s -> 3319.24s]  I...
[3319.24s -> 3321.08s]  I scared the shit out of me.
[3321.08s -> 3332.39s]  I guess I wasn't expecting the light to light his face up.
[3332.39s -> 3378.42s]  What had come over the sensible narrator?
[3378.42s -> 3384.74s]  Rather than chronicle the protagonist, more and more he talked of himself.
[3384.74s -> 3388.22s]  It's a little secret.
[3388.94s -> 3394.31s]  Britney Clarkson.
[3394.31s -> 3397.14s]  Britney Clarkson.
[3397.14s -> 3398.50s]  Britney Clarkson?
[3399.38s -> 3400.98s]  Who is Britney Clarkson?
[3402.50s -> 3420.33s]  Am I fat rolling?
[3420.33s -> 3435.58s]  What happened?
[3435.58s -> 3447.64s]  Britney Clarkson.
[3447.64s -> 3450.12s]  Anti-hero finger wagglers?
[3450.12s -> 3456.17s]  These are oven mitts.
[3456.17s -> 3463.30s]  All right, the drip is getting kind of good.
[3463.30s -> 3479.77s]  The narrator's fate was tied to Nostalgia's.
[3479.77s -> 3483.53s]  Or perhaps, even were he himself unstrung,
[3484.25s -> 3488.73s]  his affection for Nostalgia could never be severed.
[3489.69s -> 3490.97s]  Why am I here in footsteps?
[3499.90s -> 3500.62s]  Running away.
[3502.14s -> 3503.02s]  Shut up.
[3503.02s -> 3513.96s]  All right, well that was annoying.
[3519.69s -> 3522.01s]  You know, I didn't know if they were going to put a poison swamp in the game,
[3522.01s -> 3523.53s]  but of course they would.
[3523.53s -> 3530.20s]  It has to be authentic.
[3530.20s -> 3531.16s]  You just fucking...
[3531.16s -> 3531.64s]  You just...
[3531.64s -> 3533.00s]  You just snuck up on me.
[3534.02s -> 3534.98s]  You're just running away?
[3538.26s -> 3541.24s]  Bro, they're in the cardboard.
[3541.24s -> 3554.89s]  I don't have any healing.
[3554.89s -> 3565.42s]  That rabbit is going to jump out.
[3570.36s -> 3571.40s]  You little fucker.
[3577.13s -> 3577.85s]  Are you real?
[3577.85s -> 3578.41s]  What is that?
[3601.61s -> 3616.70s]  I hate this.
[3616.70s -> 3617.18s]  I'm...
[3617.18s -> 3619.18s]  This is fucking scary as hell.
[3619.18s -> 3628.89s]  It's 1030 Pacific.
[3628.89s -> 3634.70s]  I can't be screaming like this.
[3634.70s -> 3642.50s]  It's way too late to be screaming like this.
[3642.50s -> 3648.58s]  So I went a weird way though.
[3648.58s -> 3650.50s]  Maybe I'm going to go right down.
[3650.50s -> 3671.24s]  All right, let me check.
[3671.24s -> 3675.53s]  This whole area is a Zelda reference.
[3675.53s -> 3687.56s]  Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[3687.56s -> 3696.04s]  I wonder what being a caster like is in the game.
[3696.04s -> 3699.56s]  I wonder what being a caster is like in this game.
[3699.56s -> 3702.68s]  I said that's weird.
[3702.68s -> 3723.82s]  So what if service?
[3724.38s -> 3729.72s]  This is Dex Source.
[3729.72s -> 3730.28s]  This is the...
[3731.48s -> 3739.43s]  That's the Zelda sword, right?
[3739.43s -> 3740.23s]  It probably goes...
[3740.23s -> 3744.84s]  It probably has a projectile.
[3744.84s -> 3746.84s]  Well, it's not the character I'm making.
[3746.84s -> 3750.70s]  Broken of a youthful operation.
[3750.70s -> 3760.74s]  I think I just have to use it.
[3760.74s -> 3771.93s]  Okay.
[3771.93s -> 3772.89s]  But will you get...
[3773.53s -> 3775.19s]  Get out of here.
[3775.19s -> 3777.69s]  What did you all...
[3777.69s -> 3779.26s]  Oh my god.
[3779.26s -> 3779.82s]  Stop.
[3779.82s -> 3794.55s]  Oh, that's lucky.
[3794.55s -> 3796.34s]  Full stamina.
[3796.34s -> 3802.78s]  Will you stop this?
[3802.78s -> 3807.50s]  Will you just fight me?
[3807.50s -> 3808.78s]  Get over here.
[3808.78s -> 3812.78s]  So what did that do for me?
[3812.78s -> 3819.88s]  Okay, so it's lit up.
[3819.96s -> 3824.07s]  Do I have to light three of them probably?
[3824.07s -> 3829.46s]  I bet you I have to light three.
[3829.46s -> 3831.14s]  Although this is lit up a little better.
[3831.14s -> 3850.50s]  Is it gonna hurt?
[3850.50s -> 3857.61s]  Checking.
[3857.61s -> 3858.41s]  Just checking.
[3858.41s -> 3870.78s]  A lot of money.
[3870.78s -> 3871.90s]  My first stream in a long time,
[3871.90s -> 3873.18s]  I usually watch VODs.
[3873.18s -> 3894.01s]  Welcome to the stream.
[3894.01s -> 3894.57s]  Hey, what's up?
[3900.84s -> 3902.84s]  We have a lot of respect for the VOD watchers here.
[3902.84s -> 3909.96s]  The YouTube video watchers.
[3909.96s -> 3912.04s]  I know that not everybody can watch every stream,
[3912.04s -> 3916.57s]  which you never expected to either.
[3916.57s -> 3917.93s]  Whenever you catch one, you catch one.
[3917.93s -> 3925.26s]  That's it.
[3925.26s -> 3927.02s]  All right, this time I went over there and it was bad,
[3927.02s -> 3929.18s]  but I have to get the aggro.
[3929.18s -> 3930.55s]  Which one is it?
[3930.55s -> 3945.02s]  It's you.
[3945.02s -> 3945.58s]  All right, yeah.
[3945.58s -> 3947.66s]  So you got to turn on the beacon
[3947.66s -> 3949.18s]  and that gets rid of the poison.
[3949.18s -> 3953.48s]  It's a good mechanic.
[3953.48s -> 3954.52s]  Don't you even...
[3954.52s -> 3963.99s]  Did you turn to the tree?
[3963.99s -> 3967.40s]  Thank you.
[3980.86s -> 3981.58s]  No.
[3981.58s -> 3986.86s]  This weapon stinks.
[3986.86s -> 3998.28s]  Although it isn't upgraded at all, is it?
[3998.28s -> 3999.80s]  Save me mask?
[3999.80s -> 4029.42s]  All right, that's creepy, but whatever.
[4029.42s -> 4030.14s]  Keep it.
[4030.14s -> 4031.83s]  I don't...
[4031.83s -> 4033.03s]  There's no memory on this.
[4033.03s -> 4038.20s]  So I don't think I can unburden the memory.
[4038.20s -> 4049.85s]  Nothing.
[4049.85s -> 4057.05s]  This is where I died.
[4057.05s -> 4064.54s]  I forgot about you.
[4064.54s -> 4081.21s]  Honestly, the luck actually is working out pretty well.
[4081.21s -> 4083.64s]  Those crits are awesome.
[4083.64s -> 4085.83s]  There's the Zelda shield.
[4085.83s -> 4089.27s]  Oh, it's a hold.
[4089.27s -> 4090.71s]  Oh, I can just walk through it.
[4090.71s -> 4099.72s]  I feel like this would have a memory here.
[4099.72s -> 4107.62s]  Don't you think so?
[4107.62s -> 4114.34s]  Let's see.
[4114.34s -> 4116.02s]  Memory's location is known by a relic
[4116.02s -> 4118.74s]  whose memory lingers in Warlock's wild.
[4118.74s -> 4119.86s]  So that's where we are.
[4119.86s -> 4132.39s]  Nothing yet.
[4132.39s -> 4143.29s]  Maybe where you get the sword.
[4143.29s -> 4154.34s]  This is where I started.
[4154.34s -> 4164.94s]  What's the point of going all the way back?
[4164.94s -> 4171.82s]  Shortcut for what, though?
[4171.82s -> 4172.30s]  I guess...
[4172.30s -> 4174.09s]  No, that's not...
[4174.09s -> 4175.29s]  Really not that far.
[4175.29s -> 4178.34s]  Very close.
[4178.34s -> 4184.90s]  I guess I could sit down and level up
[4184.90s -> 4186.66s]  and get some flasks.
[4186.66s -> 4196.94s]  Can you please explain why you hit the pink guy every time?
[4196.94s -> 4197.50s]  I don't know.
[4198.78s -> 4201.42s]  Can you please address the Botox allegations?
[4201.42s -> 4202.84s]  I don't...
[4202.84s -> 4226.97s]  No, I refuse.
[4226.97s -> 4227.45s]  All right.
[4227.45s -> 4228.81s]  I've got enough.
[4228.81s -> 4230.17s]  Why do you hit the pink guy every time?
[4230.17s -> 4230.89s]  Why do you do that?
[4230.89s -> 4231.37s]  I don't...
[4231.37s -> 4232.73s]  Stop hitting the pink guy.
[4232.73s -> 4261.14s]  Here we go.
[4261.14s -> 4261.46s]  All right.
[4261.46s -> 4265.05s]  So where the heck am I supposed to go?
[4265.05s -> 4267.42s]  Oh, fuck.
[4267.42s -> 4268.70s]  I forgot you were respawned.
[4268.70s -> 4273.66s]  Oh, up here.
[4273.66s -> 4274.06s]  Two.
[4274.06s -> 4275.18s]  Oh, my goodness.
[4275.18s -> 4275.58s]  All right.
[4276.54s -> 4298.62s]  Is that all coming up here?
[4298.62s -> 4299.18s]  All right.
[4299.18s -> 4308.94s]  I think there's one more.
[4308.94s -> 4351.22s]  Ooh, not up here.
[4351.22s -> 4352.66s]  You know, I would deal with it,
[4352.66s -> 4357.06s]  but I don't give a rat's behind.
[4357.06s -> 4358.74s]  I don't give a rat's behind about that.
[4359.70s -> 4385.46s]  About fighting that person.
[4385.46s -> 4386.74s]  Oh, no, Chris.
[4386.74s -> 4388.18s]  Game is broken.
[4388.18s -> 4399.51s]  I got a lot.
[4399.51s -> 4411.80s]  Wait, another upgrade material?
[4411.80s -> 4413.08s]  I don't give a rat's behind.
[4413.08s -> 4414.22s]  And I know people are going to be like,
[4414.22s -> 4416.06s]  I can't believe you're saying this right now.
[4416.06s -> 4418.30s]  But I don't give a gosh darn.
[4418.30s -> 4418.86s]  OK?
[4418.86s -> 4424.65s]  Everybody knows me as the...
[4424.65s -> 4426.49s]  I don't say anything bad or anything.
[4426.49s -> 4439.75s]  But you know, I don't give a rat's behind.
[4439.75s -> 4440.47s]  Calm down.
[4440.47s -> 4443.30s]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[4443.30s -> 4451.03s]  Let me let loose.
[4451.03s -> 4473.43s]  Let me let loose sometimes.
[4473.43s -> 4474.15s]  Low state.
[4474.15s -> 4481.19s]  I actually like this area.
[4481.19s -> 4493.53s]  It's fun.
[4493.53s -> 4494.89s]  I have the other coin.
[4494.89s -> 4496.09s]  Ooh, what's that?
[4496.09s -> 4511.24s]  Another shortcut?
[4511.24s -> 4527.18s]  OK, wait, let me unlock this first.
[4527.18s -> 4536.33s]  You make pigeon noises in your sleep.
[4536.33s -> 4536.89s]  Oh.
[4536.89s -> 4542.39s]  What are you talking about?
[4542.39s -> 4561.77s]  Like, oh, look at that.
[4561.77s -> 4562.49s]  Level up.
[4562.49s -> 4571.50s]  There's the 20 vitality.
[4571.50s -> 4598.26s]  Now I'm going to go dex and luck and nothing else.
[4598.26s -> 4607.40s]  Get luck to 40.
[4607.40s -> 4610.68s]  My mom said my friend on the screen has to apologize.
[4614.55s -> 4615.75s]  I don't really know you.
[4615.75s -> 4618.86s]  Don't lie to your mother.
[4618.86s -> 4620.98s]  Don't lie to your mother like that.
[4620.98s -> 4624.73s]  You need to tell your mother the truth.
[4624.81s -> 4628.23s]  You're watching a television show and it shouldn't be.
[4628.23s -> 4629.35s]  Did he get up tomorrow?
[4629.35s -> 4637.96s]  He said you have to.
[4638.52s -> 4644.41s]  Yeah, it's Saturday tomorrow.
[4644.41s -> 4645.85s]  Wait, is it like 4 AM for you?
[4653.94s -> 4662.46s]  I tried to double it.
[4662.46s -> 4662.78s]  Ooh.
[4664.42s -> 4666.34s]  All right, I want to go this way.
[4666.34s -> 4682.23s]  Are we going to get poisoned?
[4682.23s -> 4684.33s]  Fire.
[4684.33s -> 4686.65s]  Oh, yeah.
[4686.65s -> 4694.92s]  I am on fire.
[4694.92s -> 4696.12s]  I look forward.
[4698.55s -> 4698.95s]  Hold on.
[4698.95s -> 4705.40s]  We can't talk yet.
[4705.40s -> 4711.35s]  Stop it.
[4711.35s -> 4713.59s]  Ooh, that thing looks cool.
[4713.59s -> 4714.47s]  What is that thing?
[4714.47s -> 4715.11s]  Because I want it.
[4715.11s -> 4720.09s]  I hope it's not a strength.
[4720.09s -> 4721.21s]  It's a cake pop.
[4721.21s -> 4724.97s]  And I can't use it.
[4724.97s -> 4726.89s]  I can't use the cake pop.
[4726.89s -> 4730.54s]  That makes me sad.
[4735.45s -> 4740.92s]  The TF2 update thing.
[4740.92s -> 4746.57s]  That was kind of out of nowhere, wasn't it?
[4746.57s -> 4749.45s]  I wonder if they're actually going to go through
[4749.45s -> 4751.53s]  with making an actual update.
[4751.53s -> 4767.50s]  Are you a doubter?
[4767.50s -> 4769.90s]  I don't know if the word is doubter.
[4770.70s -> 4774.52s]  It's just the game's been out for so long.
[4774.52s -> 4776.20s]  It would actually be really surprising if they were like,
[4776.20s -> 4779.70s]  you know, let's start the dev engine back up again
[4779.70s -> 4782.25s]  and make a bunch of new stuff.
[4782.41s -> 4783.61s]  It would be kind of...
[4783.61s -> 4785.91s]  They edited the post,
[4785.91s -> 4787.99s]  and it's now a holiday-sized update.
[4787.99s -> 4789.26s]  They had to clarify it.
[4790.84s -> 4791.64s]  It's a holiday size.
[4791.64s -> 4792.44s]  It's over, man.
[4794.20s -> 4794.84s]  Well, I don't know.
[4794.84s -> 4795.88s]  Hold on, though.
[4795.88s -> 4798.62s]  Just we'll see.
[4799.26s -> 4800.54s]  The reason why I didn't bring it up
[4800.54s -> 4807.77s]  is I didn't want to get excited about it.
[4807.77s -> 4808.65s]  We don't know.
[4808.65s -> 4810.55s]  It might be good.
[4810.55s -> 4811.75s]  It might be crap.
[4811.75s -> 4813.62s]  It's got to let them cook.
[4837.42s -> 4838.46s]  Oh, fuck.
[4838.46s -> 4838.94s]  I did this.
[4838.94s -> 4839.58s]  This is bad.
[4840.22s -> 4840.70s]  I'm dead.
[4841.34s -> 4844.14s]  I thought I could make it up or something.
[4847.48s -> 4848.36s]  Quit trying to fit in.
[4882.20s -> 4882.92s]  I don't even care.
[4884.81s -> 4891.90s]  We all die at some point.
[4891.90s -> 4904.79s]  Where's the elevator?
[4904.79s -> 4911.58s]  They go 6,000 souls.
[4911.58s -> 4913.66s]  Bring back the cool Jerma.
[4913.66s -> 4930.57s]  Bring back cool Jerma.
[4930.57s -> 4931.77s]  Fall asleep on stream.
[4931.77s -> 4945.46s]  No, I don't think so.
[4945.46s -> 4946.74s]  What was your favorite arc?
[4946.74s -> 4950.94s]  Somebody said.
[4950.94s -> 4954.70s]  You know, I thought about this recently.
[4954.70s -> 4956.86s]  The amount of time that I've been kind of on
[4956.86s -> 4958.46s]  like YouTube and Twitch and everything.
[4958.46s -> 4962.98s]  I don't think I could tell you.
[4962.98s -> 4967.69s]  I think I have fond memories of the whole time I've been here.
[4967.69s -> 4970.04s]  So I don't think I could really tell you.
[4970.04s -> 4982.92s]  I don't have a favorite arc.
[4982.92s -> 4993.30s]  So many shortcuts.
[4993.30s -> 4995.14s]  What is going on here?
[4995.14s -> 4997.11s]  What the hell is this?
[4997.11s -> 5000.87s]  What is going on here?
[5004.34s -> 5012.81s]  My face.
[5012.81s -> 5014.89s]  How did I hit my mouth on that wood?
[5014.89s -> 5023.62s]  I hit like my two front teeth on that.
[5023.62s -> 5034.71s]  Avoid down.
[5034.71s -> 5037.91s]  Yeah, but you never know when people are just talking shit.
[5037.91s -> 5039.40s]  Could be made up.
[5039.40s -> 5046.74s]  Is game actually good?
[5046.74s -> 5047.70s]  It is actually good.
[5047.70s -> 5049.30s]  I'm promising you it is.
[5065.21s -> 5069.30s]  All right, so let's keep going the right way.
[5069.30s -> 5075.66s]  Somebody relics here that I can identify.
[5075.66s -> 5076.54s]  Nothing.
[5076.54s -> 5077.82s]  Wait, this is new.
[5077.82s -> 5086.70s]  Oh, I want to put that on.
[5086.70s -> 5088.38s]  Oh, scarecrow.
[5088.38s -> 5096.34s]  All right, keep going.
[5096.34s -> 5096.98s]  Please.
[5096.98s -> 5106.90s]  I'm just getting greedy now.
[5106.90s -> 5119.18s]  Are you real?
[5119.18s -> 5119.74s]  Yes.
[5119.74s -> 5135.69s]  Don't even.
[5136.25s -> 5144.52s]  I actually need more stamina.
[5144.52s -> 5164.81s]  I'm running out a lot more frequently now.
[5164.81s -> 5165.45s]  Yep.
[5165.45s -> 5167.00s]  Bullshit.
[5167.00s -> 5185.34s]  Girl, why do you look like that?
[5185.34s -> 5189.98s]  You know, you're the probably 700 millionth person to say that.
[5189.98s -> 5192.94s]  How dare you?
[5192.94s -> 5201.35s]  How dare you?
[5201.35s -> 5208.60s]  Man, but you answer all those times.
[5208.60s -> 5209.96s]  How dare you say that?
[5209.96s -> 5212.95s]  Bringing up how I answer that question.
[5212.95s -> 5214.63s]  How dare you ban that person?
[5214.63s -> 5223.64s]  How dare they?
[5223.64s -> 5228.46s]  How dare you step into a conversation that I was just having with somebody
[5228.46s -> 5230.78s]  and say how dare you for me?
[5230.78s -> 5233.18s]  How dare you ban that person for five to ten minutes?
[5233.18s -> 5244.76s]  I think this is a maze.
[5244.76s -> 5254.78s]  It's a maze.
[5254.78s -> 5256.22s]  Is it a maze or am I just dumb?
[5256.22s -> 5272.92s]  I think I'm just going backwards.
[5272.92s -> 5275.59s]  Yep.
[5275.59s -> 5278.95s]  I probably have to drop the coins right and know where I've been.
[5278.95s -> 5279.27s]  All right.
[5279.27s -> 5280.87s]  Yeah, we're doing that right now.
[5280.87s -> 5282.23s]  I'm using these coins.
[5282.23s -> 5283.59s]  I got 34 of them.
[5283.59s -> 5283.99s]  Here we go.
[5283.99s -> 5285.43s]  Let's go.
[5285.43s -> 5287.27s]  I'm making sure I don't get lost.
[5287.27s -> 5292.07s]  For instance, I've been here.
[5292.07s -> 5294.14s]  I've been here.
[5294.14s -> 5298.04s]  I've been here.
[5298.04s -> 5314.14s]  This is not the right way.
[5314.14s -> 5319.62s]  I've been here.
[5323.29s -> 5324.25s]  I came up like a tunnel.
[5324.25s -> 5325.45s]  Where the hell did I even go?
[5325.45s -> 5327.10s]  Is this way?
[5327.10s -> 5327.82s]  I've been here.
[5327.82s -> 5338.73s]  Oh, you little dorks.
[5355.78s -> 5378.74s]  Who's doing this weird shit?
[5378.74s -> 5379.30s]  Stop.
[5379.30s -> 5387.43s]  I thought I had these.
[5387.43s -> 5390.94s]  Okay.
[5390.94s -> 5391.90s]  It's hard.
[5391.90s -> 5415.06s]  Keep going.
[5415.06s -> 5415.78s]  Blood.
[5415.78s -> 5416.58s]  All right.
[5416.58s -> 5417.38s]  I've been here.
[5417.38s -> 5424.22s]  I've been here.
[5424.22s -> 5426.14s]  This is where I've been here.
[5426.14s -> 5427.82s]  I'm not going down there again.
[5427.82s -> 5429.13s]  In there.
[5429.13s -> 5431.05s]  I've now been up here.
[5431.05s -> 5435.69s]  I've been right here.
[5435.69s -> 5438.46s]  I haven't been here.
[5438.46s -> 5439.18s]  I've been here.
[5439.18s -> 5460.20s]  I've been here.
[5460.20s -> 5476.12s]  Kind of cool.
[5481.50s -> 5483.10s]  Anything else scale with decks?
[5483.10s -> 5487.22s]  No, that's the only one I have.
[5487.22s -> 5492.39s]  You made my little brother cry
[5492.39s -> 5493.83s]  when you said rats behind.
[5493.83s -> 5498.52s]  Yeah, this is the new Jerma.
[5498.52s -> 5515.93s]  It's the new me.
[5518.14s -> 5518.86s]  Problem.
[5518.86s -> 5530.02s]  Dark Jerma.
[5530.02s -> 5533.54s]  Oh, look, it's our friend.
[5533.54s -> 5535.00s]  Hello.
[5551.61s -> 5552.89s]  I thought that was him still talking.
[5555.61s -> 5556.41s]  What?
[5556.41s -> 5557.05s]  No.
[5557.05s -> 5558.09s]  Well, yes.
[5558.09s -> 5560.57s]  I mean, it's yet to be proven.
[5562.70s -> 5563.26s]  Come now.
[5565.45s -> 5566.49s]  I thought that was you.
[5571.69s -> 5574.25s]  How dare you say how dare you in this game?
[5575.29s -> 5576.25s]  I'm fucking quitting this game
[5576.25s -> 5576.89s]  and uninstalling it.
[5590.94s -> 5591.74s]  They know each other.
[5593.90s -> 5597.58s]  My friend's heart to love a thing so much
[5598.30s -> 5601.10s]  to hold responsibility for that thing
[5601.10s -> 5604.06s]  and it'd be twisted beyond the tenderness
[5604.06s -> 5604.94s]  of your stewardship.
[5606.38s -> 5607.42s]  That's the goodness.
[5607.42s -> 5609.18s]  How dare you in due course,
[5609.18s -> 5612.46s]  you will confront the greatest of the great ones.
[5612.46s -> 5613.82s]  Someone has to.
[5614.94s -> 5615.50s]  Yes.
[5615.50s -> 5618.78s]  Well, I suppose I do like riddles.
[5618.78s -> 5622.22s]  A well spun riddle positions its maker
[5622.30s -> 5624.70s]  in the perfect position for what may come
[5625.26s -> 5628.30s]  obtuse enough to not be held liable
[5628.30s -> 5630.38s]  for the ensuing shenanigans,
[5630.38s -> 5635.66s]  but cryptic enough to suggest unquestionable wisdom.
[5635.66s -> 5638.70s]  More importantly, a riddle does not violate
[5638.70s -> 5640.46s]  the listener's own discovery.
[5642.18s -> 5643.62s]  Back to your quest.
[5643.62s -> 5644.50s]  Back to your quest.
[5645.38s -> 5647.22s]  Friends are rare in nostalgia.
[5649.54s -> 5651.54s]  I actually did not really mean to do that.
[5653.08s -> 5653.58s]  Whoops.
[5658.62s -> 5659.10s]  Okay.
[5659.10s -> 5659.90s]  So that's that.
[5660.62s -> 5663.16s]  I've been here.
[5663.16s -> 5667.99s]  I've been here.
[5670.73s -> 5671.37s]  And I've been here.
[5680.82s -> 5682.18s]  That thing is going to be,
[5682.18s -> 5682.74s]  you know what I mean?
[5692.20s -> 5693.74s]  I love this weapon.
[5693.74s -> 5704.34s]  The offhand sword just hits so hard.
[5706.90s -> 5707.62s]  Tale of luck.
[5722.89s -> 5748.18s]  Nothing is vibrating.
[5748.18s -> 5749.54s]  Oh, new bonfire.
[5749.54s -> 5752.81s]  How do I get over there?
[5752.81s -> 5773.61s]  Oh, nice.
[5773.61s -> 5786.55s]  Memory of a valiant hero.
[5786.55s -> 5791.21s]  Home of source, blank parchment.
[5791.21s -> 5796.17s]  I hear a anvil.
[5796.17s -> 5797.53s]  What's your taco bell order?
[5797.53s -> 5799.13s]  I need to know as soon as possible
[5799.13s -> 5800.17s]  or I'm fucked.
[5807.40s -> 5809.16s]  You're in the drive-through right now?
[5810.71s -> 5811.75s]  Shit, come on, man.
[5812.31s -> 5813.35s]  Can I help you?
[5813.35s -> 5818.04s]  Oh, um, hurry up.
[5818.04s -> 5822.06s]  Can I get two cheese or gordita crunches
[5822.06s -> 5827.10s]  and a large Baja blast
[5827.10s -> 5832.15s]  and one Doritos Locos taco?
[5832.15s -> 5839.45s]  There you go.
[5839.45s -> 5849.42s]  Saved.
[5849.42s -> 5855.59s]  Can I not open this door?
[5855.59s -> 5857.19s]  We have the same fucking order.
[5857.19s -> 5860.86s]  I think that's the only order at Taco Bell.
[5860.86s -> 5864.47s]  I don't, I think everything else is not worth ordering.
[5864.47s -> 5865.99s]  We're all going to have a very similar order
[5865.99s -> 5875.77s]  because that's the order.
[5875.77s -> 5877.61s]  Such a ridiculous gate.
[5877.61s -> 5881.53s]  Was there a humility implicit in its frame?
[5881.53s -> 5885.05s]  A humility so long ago forsaken.
[5887.21s -> 5887.77s]  Here it is.
[5889.62s -> 5890.90s]  I don't have a coin.
[5891.70s -> 5892.26s]  What?
[5892.90s -> 5895.62s]  What about a crunch wrap?
[5898.50s -> 5899.78s]  The issue with Taco Bell is...
[5900.60s -> 5901.64s]  All right, let's go over this.
[5902.84s -> 5906.20s]  During my tier list, I brought this up.
[5906.20s -> 5909.51s]  Taco Bell has 20 items on the menu.
[5910.23s -> 5911.59s]  They're all B minus.
[5912.97s -> 5916.73s]  They have one thing on the menu that is an S plus.
[5919.10s -> 5919.98s]  I don't...
[5919.98s -> 5922.46s]  If you have something on the menu that is S plus,
[5922.46s -> 5925.66s]  it's so hard for me to order the B minus items.
[5925.66s -> 5927.02s]  Even though they're okay, they're good.
[5927.02s -> 5927.66s]  They're not bad.
[5927.66s -> 5929.85s]  I enjoy them.
[5929.85s -> 5931.37s]  But the cheesy gordita crunch is...
[5932.79s -> 5934.47s]  If I'm going to go to Taco Bell,
[5934.47s -> 5936.81s]  I'm going to get cheesy gordita crunches.
[5936.81s -> 5940.33s]  Everything else is like two or three rungs down for me.
[5940.33s -> 5942.25s]  So it's like, oh man, I'm going to go to Taco Bell.
[5942.25s -> 5942.81s]  Oh, you know what?
[5942.81s -> 5944.09s]  Let me try one of the...
[5944.09s -> 5944.73s]  No, fuck that.
[5944.73s -> 5946.01s]  Cheesy gordita crunch, S plus.
[5946.57s -> 5947.29s]  No, what else?
[5948.09s -> 5949.29s]  It's hard to do that.
[5949.29s -> 5951.37s]  Because I don't go to Taco Bell.
[5951.37s -> 5953.53s]  Holly and I don't go to Taco Bell that often.
[5953.53s -> 5955.29s]  So when we do, it's like...
[5957.54s -> 5959.94s]  Should I get the chalupa?
[5959.94s -> 5964.22s]  No, no, no, of course not.
[5964.22s -> 5965.10s]  All right, let's go.
[5965.10s -> 5973.03s]  No dialogue?
[5973.67s -> 5977.51s]  You just did almost 400 plus damage.
[5977.51s -> 5980.70s]  I'm going to be a cheese ball.
[5984.65s -> 5986.09s]  I like the other stuff at Taco Bell.
[5986.09s -> 5988.57s]  It's just I didn't sit down at the bonfire.
[5988.57s -> 5989.53s]  Oh my God, help me.
[6006.94s -> 6019.22s]  God, maybe I should do stamina.
[6019.22s -> 6020.98s]  No, let's keep dex.
[6020.98s -> 6023.26s]  Let's get to like 25 dex.
[6023.26s -> 6042.60s]  What's the worst fast food restaurant?
[6044.36s -> 6044.92s]  I don't know.
[6045.48s -> 6046.97s]  I'm trying to think.
[6046.97s -> 6049.38s]  What is the worst fast food restaurant?
[6049.38s -> 6049.62s]  Huh?
[6049.62s -> 6051.70s]  There ain't supposed to be an anvil in the wilds.
[6051.70s -> 6056.18s]  Disguarded amidst so many tools of field and forge.
[6056.18s -> 6056.50s]  Who would do this?
[6056.50s -> 6057.30s]  My fingernails.
[6057.30s -> 6057.86s]  My fingernails are long.
[6057.86s -> 6059.70s]  Even those who hate your kind still got to work.
[6060.58s -> 6062.98s]  This wasn't just discarding some traditions.
[6063.94s -> 6066.10s]  It was a discarding of tradition itself.
[6066.10s -> 6066.42s]  BK.
[6066.42s -> 6068.90s]  I wonder what this anvil has helped forge.
[6068.90s -> 6070.58s]  Maybe I can replicate the feats.
[6071.62s -> 6071.94s]  Oops.
[6073.64s -> 6078.25s]  Yeah, I mean, I kind of gauge how much I like a restaurant based on how many.
[6078.25s -> 6081.21s]  Look, everyone goes, oh man, that fast food restaurant sucks.
[6081.77s -> 6087.91s]  But I gauge how high up on the list it is for me based on how often I go.
[6087.91s -> 6095.69s]  And I have not been to a Burger King in I think the last time I actually went to.
[6095.69s -> 6099.67s]  But before doing that Whopper thing that everybody seems to like,
[6100.39s -> 6113.02s]  um, before doing that, it was all the time that I ate two cheeseburgers.
[6113.58s -> 6117.11s]  Because I was getting a blood test and I was freaking out because I didn't eat all day.
[6117.11s -> 6120.87s]  And I ate two fucking, did I tell this story before?
[6122.84s -> 6123.96s]  I've told this story before.
[6127.86s -> 6129.06s]  No, I think I have.
[6129.06s -> 6129.70s]  I definitely have.
[6132.97s -> 6134.73s]  I haven't, I swear I have.
[6134.73s -> 6135.85s]  Whatever, I'll tell it real quick.
[6136.73s -> 6141.06s]  So, um, one time, this is, I mean, probably five years ago,
[6141.06s -> 6142.90s]  at least at least three or four years ago, something like that.
[6143.78s -> 6146.50s]  I had a doctor's appointment to go get blood work.
[6147.06s -> 6149.03s]  And I didn't eat all day.
[6149.03s -> 6150.47s]  And you know when you get your blood taken?
[6151.69s -> 6155.22s]  It's, I don't, I'm not afraid of needles or anything.
[6155.22s -> 6158.50s]  I'm not afraid of going to the doctor and like, oh, no, no, no, don't like, don't do that.
[6159.54s -> 6165.78s]  But if I haven't eaten at all, I like to be well fed because you can get a little,
[6166.42s -> 6169.30s]  I don't know, you can get kind of lightheaded sometimes if you don't for some reason.
[6170.02s -> 6174.02s]  Um, yeah, fasting before blood work and yeah, I'm not, I don't know.
[6174.02s -> 6177.48s]  But still, I get a little lightheaded sometimes.
[6177.48s -> 6181.69s]  But so I'm, I didn't eat all day.
[6181.69s -> 6185.30s]  And I was like, fuck, I, I gotta go, I'm going to the doctor's appointment.
[6185.30s -> 6186.58s]  I need to eat something.
[6186.58s -> 6189.14s]  I don't want to get like, they're taking all my blood out.
[6189.14s -> 6192.10s]  And then I'm like, oh, I'm like, I feel woozy or whatever.
[6192.10s -> 6194.02s]  You know, I feel a little weird.
[6194.02s -> 6195.86s]  So how long did you fast?
[6195.86s -> 6197.61s]  I just hadn't eaten.
[6197.61s -> 6199.29s]  I didn't, I don't think I had to fast for this blood work.
[6199.29s -> 6201.45s]  You don't have to, you don't have to fast for all of your blood work.
[6201.45s -> 6202.49s]  Only certain blood work you do.
[6203.13s -> 6206.09s]  So I didn't have to fast, but I was like, okay, I want to eat something.
[6206.09s -> 6208.49s]  So I went to Burger King was the only thing I could think of.
[6208.49s -> 6212.18s]  I was like, fuck what's like here right now.
[6212.18s -> 6214.82s]  And I just driving, driving, driving like, I, there's a Burger King right here.
[6215.38s -> 6216.34s]  Burger King.
[6216.34s -> 6218.74s]  It's like, I don't want Burger King, but whatever, I have to do this.
[6218.74s -> 6221.78s]  But my appointment was in like 20 minutes.
[6221.78s -> 6222.90s]  It was in like 15 minutes.
[6223.46s -> 6225.46s]  So I'm just like, fuck, all right, go to the drive-through.
[6225.46s -> 6227.14s]  I'm just going to get something small, nothing big.
[6227.14s -> 6228.34s]  And I want to like, overdo it.
[6228.34s -> 6234.58s]  I got two regular cheeseburgers, just two plain cheeseburgers from Burger King.
[6234.58s -> 6236.42s]  And I just ate them really fast.
[6237.35s -> 6239.43s]  And then I kept going to the doctor.
[6240.42s -> 6243.06s]  I got my blood taken.
[6243.06s -> 6245.45s]  I know I didn't eat that much.
[6245.45s -> 6246.49s]  So I got my blood taken.
[6246.49s -> 6247.37s]  I was like, everything's fine.
[6247.37s -> 6247.85s]  I feel good.
[6247.85s -> 6248.41s]  I feel all right.
[6248.97s -> 6252.73s]  And I hear back from the doctor, you know, like a week later.
[6252.73s -> 6257.05s]  Hey, I just want to talk to you really quickly about your cholesterol is a little high.
[6260.28s -> 6261.80s]  And I was like, oh shit.
[6261.80s -> 6265.30s]  And I'm sitting there thinking, is it the cheeseburgers?
[6265.30s -> 6269.62s]  Because I ate two cheeseburgers like 15 minutes before getting my blood taken.
[6269.62s -> 6270.50s]  So I said that.
[6271.14s -> 6276.68s]  I was like, oh, I had like two cheeseburgers like right before the blood test.
[6276.68s -> 6277.88s]  That's probably what it was, right?
[6277.88s -> 6283.45s]  And the doctor was just like, no, that's not what happened.
[6283.45s -> 6288.52s]  I thought that I had like cheeseburger blood before I went to get that blood test.
[6288.52s -> 6292.73s]  And I'm sitting there going, no fucking way.
[6292.73s -> 6296.25s]  I'm telling you, if I went to go take that test again, and I ate like spinach,
[6296.81s -> 6299.77s]  salmon, and a bunch of broccoli, it would have been lower.
[6299.77s -> 6302.60s]  That's what I really felt.
[6303.16s -> 6305.24s]  And there's the story.
[6305.24s -> 6308.31s]  I thought I had cheeseburger blood.
[6310.84s -> 6312.68s]  Oh, your cholesterol is a little bit high.
[6312.68s -> 6313.32s]  It's not too bad.
[6313.32s -> 6315.80s]  But you know, we really should probably try to get that brought down.
[6315.80s -> 6318.92s]  Oh, well, see, I ate two cheeseburgers.
[6318.92s -> 6320.68s]  So it's like, you fucking idiot.
[6328.82s -> 6330.02s]  I want to upgrade.
[6330.02s -> 6331.62s]  Ah, I need one more.
[6331.62s -> 6333.35s]  Shoot.
[6344.65s -> 6348.22s]  I got to find another weapon I like.
[6357.64s -> 6359.48s]  Now address the grilled cheese off the floor.
[6360.28s -> 6361.16s]  That's not real.
[6361.16s -> 6363.64s]  I made that up like 10 minutes before the stream.
[6368.26s -> 6371.46s]  I don't even remember the context of what we're talking about.
[6371.46s -> 6372.50s]  I don't even remember.
[6373.06s -> 6377.70s]  I was in pre-stream chat today and I said, oh, yeah, I ate a grilled cheese off the floor.
[6378.34s -> 6379.06s]  I don't know.
[6379.06s -> 6380.58s]  I thought it was funny for five seconds.
[6384.65s -> 6385.93s]  Guys, I'm almost 40.
[6387.58s -> 6391.82s]  As an almost 40-year-old man, you don't eat grilled cheese off the floor.
[6393.13s -> 6394.73s]  That just doesn't happen anymore.
[6396.74s -> 6402.28s]  I mean, maybe when I was like 10, maybe I dropped a grilled cheese on the ground.
[6403.98s -> 6405.02s]  He's almost 40.
[6406.39s -> 6407.67s]  Yeah, bro.
[6408.50s -> 6408.90s]  All right.
[6408.90s -> 6410.58s]  I need to play my video game now, please.
[6412.73s -> 6414.73s]  What age are you allowed to eat grilled cheese?
[6414.73s -> 6417.21s]  There's no, I'm just saying like if you're like a 10-year-old and you're like, oops,
[6417.21s -> 6418.17s]  I dropped my thing.
[6418.17s -> 6419.05s]  I don't care.
[6420.25s -> 6423.82s]  As a 40-year-old man, somebody has the log.
[6426.39s -> 6431.51s]  It's me and hey, dude, I heard you ate a grilled cheese once that fell on the floor.
[6431.51s -> 6432.55s]  Is this true?
[6432.55s -> 6434.71s]  And then I said, bro, fucking leave me alone.
[6438.82s -> 6442.62s]  That's what I said.
[6443.58s -> 6448.57s]  I feel like I should have an FAQ, but it would be 30 pages long.
[6448.57s -> 6451.93s]  There are too many questions, some not even based in reality.
[6451.93s -> 6454.25s]  Hey, dude, I heard you ate a grilled cheese once off the floor.
[6454.25s -> 6454.81s]  Is this true?
[6454.81s -> 6456.09s]  Bro, fucking leave me alone.
[6456.09s -> 6457.21s]  Of course it is true.
[6457.21s -> 6458.97s]  But I don't want to say it all the time.
[6458.97s -> 6465.90s]  But that was a joke reference or whatever.
[6466.62s -> 6467.42s]  You get it.
[6485.45s -> 6492.26s]  Somebody said, dude, you keep pretending that you're some normal
[6492.34s -> 6499.93s]  40-year-old, but you just talked about a story how you thought you had cheeseburger blood.
[6499.93s -> 6503.05s]  But that's like a funny story.
[6504.33s -> 6506.89s]  By the way, that was also like years ago.
[6506.89s -> 6508.73s]  That was not like yesterday.
[6508.73s -> 6514.90s]  I promise I am a functioning adult.
[6514.90s -> 6516.30s]  It was like three years.
[6516.30s -> 6517.50s]  It's years ago.
[6517.50s -> 6524.39s]  I didn't think.
[6524.39s -> 6526.79s]  I just like was a thought that crossed my mind.
[6531.90s -> 6541.43s]  You're concerned about cheeseburger blood as a 37-year-old.
[6541.43s -> 6543.91s]  Oh, we just have fun conversations sometimes.
[6547.29s -> 6549.21s]  It's not that deep.
[6549.21s -> 6561.08s]  I've been here.
[6561.08s -> 6563.80s]  You also told a story about drinking espresso on the toilet.
[6566.46s -> 6569.50s]  Yeah, but so what?
[6570.30s -> 6571.34s]  So what?
[6571.34s -> 6573.34s]  I'm living life a little, all right?
[6573.34s -> 6573.82s]  So what?
[6573.82s -> 6574.94s]  I'm living life a little.
[6576.60s -> 6578.52s]  We can't do that, apparently.
[6578.52s -> 6581.00s]  No, you can't drink an espresso on the toilet.
[6581.00s -> 6582.84s]  I'm living my life, all right?
[6582.84s -> 6584.94s]  You can live yours however you want.
[6584.94s -> 6587.10s]  I'm living my life.
[6587.10s -> 6599.93s]  Where am I going?
[6599.93s -> 6600.89s]  Why is this over here?
[6600.89s -> 6603.83s]  It's a dead end for no reason.
[6611.61s -> 6613.61s]  Yeah, I'm just I'm living my life.
[6613.61s -> 6617.75s]  Okay, this is this is progress here.
[6636.98s -> 6639.78s]  Yeah, I just I felt I sometimes I just feel like doing stuff.
[6642.81s -> 6647.26s]  I saw that you prop hunt mother butthead.
[6659.34s -> 6666.01s]  Where are you?
[6666.01s -> 6671.06s]  Yeah, I got hey, we got a motto on this channel called you do you.
[6672.97s -> 6676.25s]  If I want to drink an espresso on the toilet, I'm doing it.
[6677.05s -> 6678.09s]  And you know what?
[6678.09s -> 6679.69s]  I'm doing it tomorrow morning.
[6679.69s -> 6681.90s]  I'm doing it tomorrow morning.
[6681.90s -> 6683.10s]  That sounds like a great idea.
[6683.58s -> 6712.09s]  You poured orange juice into a purse.
[6720.01s -> 6721.29s]  Yeah, I fuck around a lot.
[6728.89s -> 6732.22s]  I remember that.
[6732.22s -> 6733.34s]  Oh, demonic.
[6733.34s -> 6735.02s]  Look at this demonic shit.
[6735.02s -> 6739.88s]  And let me correct the record on this.
[6739.88s -> 6741.08s]  It was banana milk.
[6741.08s -> 6753.58s]  What are they sacrificing this?
[6753.58s -> 6756.22s]  Is that a kid?
[6756.22s -> 6760.12s]  Why am I killing this?
[6760.12s -> 6761.16s]  Why did I just kill that kid?
[6765.75s -> 6767.08s]  Oh, wait.
[6767.08s -> 6767.56s]  Interesting.
[6767.56s -> 6775.58s]  Hold on.
[6775.58s -> 6776.14s]  Really?
[6776.14s -> 6776.70s]  Come on.
[6776.70s -> 6777.02s]  Really?
[6778.66s -> 6779.38s]  Damn.
[6779.38s -> 6802.60s]  What I figured it would have been here.
[6802.60s -> 6808.84s]  You ever had vanilla ice cream with soy sauce?
[6808.84s -> 6812.62s]  No, I don't think I probably ever would probably.
[6813.42s -> 6814.78s]  I don't really like soy sauce that much.
[6814.78s -> 6815.74s]  I'm not a soy sauce fan.
[6817.32s -> 6822.04s]  I like soy sauce very, very rarely with sushi.
[6822.04s -> 6823.16s]  And that's pretty much it.
[6823.16s -> 6833.72s]  I like to dip the sushi into the soy sauce.
[6833.72s -> 6835.88s]  Take a tiny little bit of wasabi right on top.
[6837.14s -> 6837.54s]  Done.
[6837.54s -> 6838.26s]  Easy.
[6838.26s -> 6843.16s]  Spicy tuna roll like salmon roll or even like a good.
[6843.16s -> 6843.56s]  Yeah.
[6843.56s -> 6844.20s]  Oh, yeah.
[6844.20s -> 6847.74s]  It's probably the only way I eat sushi.
[6852.50s -> 6853.70s]  I love wasabi.
[6855.02s -> 6859.45s]  I love nasal heat, nasal heat.
[6859.45s -> 6862.63s]  It's what I like more than mouth heat.
[6863.27s -> 6865.77s]  I find mouth heat to be.
[6865.77s -> 6866.89s]  Did I get a coin?
[6866.89s -> 6878.12s]  I didn't get a coin yet.
[6878.12s -> 6886.47s]  Shit.
[6886.47s -> 6888.89s]  No, no, I did.
[6888.89s -> 6889.45s]  No, I did.
[6890.01s -> 6896.66s]  Do you miss Boston area Chinese food?
[6896.66s -> 6898.66s]  I miss a lot of Boston area food.
[6899.22s -> 6907.00s]  I guess not with Vinny.
[6908.20s -> 6910.12s]  Vegas food is phenomenal.
[6910.12s -> 6923.24s]  Some of the best sit down restaurants I've ever been to.
[6923.24s -> 6928.68s]  But a lot of those East Coast delis, sub shops, pizza places, Chinese food.
[6929.32s -> 6932.79s]  There's a lot of really, really, really good ones.
[6933.35s -> 6935.98s]  I miss the snow too.
[6940.82s -> 6941.62s]  I love Vegas.
[6943.35s -> 6947.59s]  It's kind of like both sort of completely different climates.
[6949.19s -> 6952.23s]  I love the sun shining.
[6953.85s -> 6954.57s]  It's super nice.
[6954.57s -> 6958.84s]  It's just it's always sunny outside.
[6958.84s -> 6960.02s]  Always.
[6960.02s -> 6963.22s]  It's just every time you wake up in Las Vegas, especially from.
[6963.22s -> 6967.62s]  I want to say it gets cold here.
[6967.62s -> 6968.42s]  It does get cold.
[6968.42s -> 6974.39s]  It gets to be somewhere in the mid 30s Fahrenheit.
[6974.39s -> 6982.54s]  But besides like a month or two of the winter, it is beautiful every single day.
[6982.54s -> 6987.27s]  Every day.
[6987.27s -> 6991.05s]  Because that's one of the things that I had an issue with in on the East Coast.
[6991.77s -> 6993.85s]  It felt like there were more rainy days.
[6993.85s -> 6997.69s]  There were more kind of just dreary days than there were sunny days.
[6997.69s -> 7002.90s]  And I felt like I really wanted to get in a different environment like that.
[7002.90s -> 7008.02s]  That was more sunshine.
[7008.02s -> 7012.94s]  And a lot of people don't like the heat out here because it can get to be in the Fahrenheit.
[7012.94s -> 7022.94s]  It does get to be somewhere in the 110 to 115, 120 Fahrenheit sometimes.
[7022.94s -> 7024.58s]  But I kind of like it.
[7024.58s -> 7025.30s]  I don't know why.
[7025.30s -> 7030.26s]  It's just so it's so ridiculous.
[7030.26s -> 7032.50s]  It's just so it's like an oven outside.
[7032.50s -> 7034.98s]  It's it's so something about it.
[7034.98s -> 7035.38s]  I don't know.
[7035.38s -> 7036.02s]  I like it.
[7036.02s -> 7042.74s]  It's just so much more different than anything I've ever experienced.
[7042.74s -> 7044.74s]  And it's not sweaty because it's a dry heat.
[7045.70s -> 7048.50s]  You got to be careful though because it's dry heat.
[7048.50s -> 7053.94s]  There is not very much humidity in Vegas or the whole state of Nevada.
[7053.94s -> 7056.66s]  So you don't sweat.
[7056.66s -> 7061.90s]  It's just hot.
[7061.90s -> 7067.18s]  I have been in really hot days in the Boston area.
[7067.18s -> 7072.30s]  85, 90, 95 degrees in the Boston area is awful.
[7072.30s -> 7074.25s]  I'm like soaking wet.
[7074.25s -> 7076.17s]  It's it's just humidity.
[7078.25s -> 7081.61s]  85 in Boston is not as bad.
[7081.61s -> 7082.17s]  That's not true.
[7082.17s -> 7084.97s]  90 in Boston is not as bad as 115 in Vegas.
[7084.97s -> 7106.84s]  I'm telling you this isn't.
[7106.84s -> 7108.20s]  Oh, stay with them.
[7108.20s -> 7118.22s]  Are we talking about humidity right now?
[7120.23s -> 7126.79s]  Now I humidity is Boston was kind of really got everything.
[7126.79s -> 7128.42s]  It got a bunch of snow.
[7128.42s -> 7129.62s]  It got a bunch of heat.
[7129.62s -> 7131.38s]  It got a bunch of fall weather.
[7131.38s -> 7134.73s]  Actually fall in Boston is like my favorite thing.
[7134.73s -> 7139.30s]  I think fall in Massachusetts is almost not comparable.
[7139.30s -> 7140.26s]  What's with this thing?
[7140.26s -> 7145.67s]  Is it weird?
[7145.67s -> 7152.04s]  Are you doing that?
[7152.04s -> 7154.71s]  I isn't going to poison me, isn't it?
[7158.84s -> 7160.36s]  I can't wait.
[7160.36s -> 7161.88s]  I'm out of coins.
[7165.83s -> 7166.55s]  Actual lizard.
[7166.55s -> 7169.19s]  You're the type to spend your day laying on a rock.
[7169.19s -> 7175.98s]  Hey, do not dog wizards.
[7175.98s -> 7179.34s]  I'm not wizards.
[7179.34s -> 7181.10s]  Don't talk about wizards like that.
[7181.10s -> 7197.10s]  Should I just tank it and run?
[7197.10s -> 7198.84s]  Or is that stupid?
[7205.53s -> 7207.54s]  Dude, is it stupid?
[7207.54s -> 7208.58s]  Should I tank it and just run?
[7209.14s -> 7213.66s]  How much further do I have to possibly go?
[7230.26s -> 7231.86s]  Dude, get off of.
[7231.86s -> 7249.70s]  No, I want to say yes.
[7255.05s -> 7303.30s]  Again, I bring the camera back.
[7303.30s -> 7319.94s]  Somebody.
[7319.94s -> 7324.50s]  Wait, somebody said they had a chicken sandwich because of me and they're pissed or something.
[7324.50s -> 7326.26s]  What happened?
[7326.26s -> 7330.58s]  How could I serve?
[7330.58s -> 7334.46s]  Why are you mad at me?
[7334.46s -> 7339.05s]  Let's go again.
[7339.05s -> 7344.25s]  Plus three.
[7344.25s -> 7345.77s]  This thing is deadly now.
[7347.30s -> 7349.62s]  It's deadly.
[7349.62s -> 7358.31s]  All right.
[7358.31s -> 7360.23s]  This is tower number three.
[7360.23s -> 7362.14s]  I need to find another coin.
[7362.14s -> 7373.22s]  I think the kids have the coin.
[7373.22s -> 7376.06s]  Oh, I'm still mad.
[7376.06s -> 7378.62s]  I got an original chicken sandwich because of you and it wasn't very good.
[7378.62s -> 7379.82s]  You have one from Burger King?
[7394.89s -> 7396.09s]  Long chicken sandwich.
[7396.09s -> 7400.06s]  Oh, I mean, it's that really my fault.
[7400.06s -> 7405.00s]  I don't the last time I really went to Burger King for real, real, for real.
[7406.82s -> 7407.46s]  I don't know.
[7407.46s -> 7410.34s]  It's probably 10, 15, I don't know, 10 years ago.
[7410.34s -> 7413.14s]  And I got a long chicken sandwich and I was like, yeah, that was all right.
[7413.14s -> 7441.86s]  A lot of here.
[7441.86s -> 7445.54s]  You know, Burger King could probably be really, really good.
[7445.54s -> 7446.34s]  And I would never know.
[7451.11s -> 7451.67s]  What is that?
[7454.54s -> 7455.98s]  Has anybody been there recently?
[7464.58s -> 7464.90s]  Okay.
[7464.90s -> 7465.93s]  Yeah.
[7465.93s -> 7468.86s]  How is it?
[7468.86s -> 7469.74s]  Is it fine?
[7469.74s -> 7470.30s]  Is it all right?
[7472.38s -> 7473.34s]  It's mid.
[7473.34s -> 7478.81s]  They have good French toast.
[7478.81s -> 7484.46s]  I don't know if I read that wrong, but that kind of makes me want to go.
[7484.46s -> 7485.26s]  Is that real?
[7495.78s -> 7496.42s]  French toast.
[7496.98s -> 7498.66s]  Burger King has French toast.
[7498.66s -> 7501.27s]  What dimension am I in?
[7501.27s -> 7502.55s]  How have I never heard of this?
[7502.55s -> 7522.09s]  I'm eating a double whopper right now and give us a rating out of 10.
[7522.09s -> 7532.86s]  How is it?
[7532.86s -> 7533.26s]  Two?
[7533.26s -> 7534.30s]  I don't think that's the same person.
[7539.19s -> 7542.15s]  That's dead space.
[7542.15s -> 7542.87s]  Hold on.
[7542.87s -> 7543.99s]  I need to look at that.
[7543.99s -> 7549.18s]  Seven out of 10.
[7549.18s -> 7563.08s]  I can put on the dead space gear.
[7563.08s -> 7565.86s]  That's funny.
[7565.86s -> 7567.74s]  It's fat rolling.
[7567.74s -> 7569.10s]  Unfortunately, this is strength.
[7569.10s -> 7580.28s]  But I feel like something is vibrating.
[7580.28s -> 7585.91s]  No, I could probably keep the helmet.
[7585.91s -> 7591.93s]  Chesapeake's probably too much.
[7591.93s -> 7592.89s]  Still fat rolling.
[7592.89s -> 7600.84s]  70% right?
[7600.84s -> 7601.48s]  71.
[7602.04s -> 7610.74s]  That works.
[7610.74s -> 7620.76s]  Oh, yep.
[7620.76s -> 7621.32s]  Token.
[7621.32s -> 7622.65s]  Okay.
[7622.65s -> 7624.25s]  Now where's tower four?
[7629.51s -> 7631.03s]  They gave it an eight out of 10.
[7631.03s -> 7635.86s]  The bacon double cheese XL is a 10 out of 10 is what they said.
[7635.86s -> 7636.90s]  Delicious.
[7636.90s -> 7640.62s]  We got a delicious.
[7640.62s -> 7645.91s]  Okay.
[7645.91s -> 7649.37s]  Bacon double cheese burger?
[7649.37s -> 7650.49s]  XL though.
[7650.49s -> 7654.62s]  That's a big ass burger.
[7656.47s -> 7657.51s]  How much bigger is the...
[7657.51s -> 7659.51s]  Why does it have like t-shirt sizes?
[7659.51s -> 7660.15s]  When did...
[7660.15s -> 7663.03s]  Is there like a small, medium, large XL, triple XL?
[7663.03s -> 7678.50s]  Why is it like a shirt?
[7678.50s -> 7680.10s]  That's a man-sized viewer.
[7691.35s -> 7691.75s]  All right.
[7691.75s -> 7694.55s]  Time to try to find where that fourth tower is.
[7694.55s -> 7703.27s]  I used to get the rodeo burger in mod chat.
[7703.27s -> 7703.91s]  VR Josh.
[7703.91s -> 7704.15s]  Yeah.
[7704.15s -> 7706.47s]  The rodeo burger was actually fantastic.
[7706.47s -> 7713.70s]  If you don't know, the rodeo burger at BK was a tie-in with small soldiers.
[7714.26s -> 7714.98s]  It was a movie.
[7717.45s -> 7718.41s]  That movie came out.
[7719.05s -> 7724.25s]  And that burger was attached to it.
[7724.25s -> 7726.49s]  It was probably the single best item they ever came up with.
[7732.47s -> 7733.75s]  It never left?
[7733.75s -> 7735.80s]  Why do I feel like it did?
[7738.04s -> 7739.88s]  It definitely did for a while.
[7739.88s -> 7742.12s]  I know it did because I remember it wasn't there.
[7742.12s -> 7753.21s]  Is this tower four?
[7753.21s -> 7757.08s]  No, it's tower three.
[7757.08s -> 7757.72s]  Well, I'm going to...
[7758.52s -> 7763.99s]  All right.
[7763.99s -> 7765.67s]  Pause this conversation for five seconds.
[7766.47s -> 7767.91s]  I need to find the right route.
[7767.91s -> 7769.67s]  I need to look and not look at chat.
[7769.67s -> 7770.55s]  Give me a minute.
[7770.55s -> 7776.17s]  I don't think it's this one.
[7776.17s -> 7783.64s]  Shit, I went down here already.
[7783.64s -> 7784.44s]  Where's my coins?
[7801.21s -> 7802.81s]  Game did that thing again where it minimized.
[7803.37s -> 7806.28s]  That was weird.
[7806.28s -> 7807.18s]  All right.
[7807.18s -> 7807.82s]  He's not looking.
[7807.82s -> 7808.70s]  Tell him he sucks.
[7812.17s -> 7812.97s]  I used them all.
[7818.31s -> 7820.71s]  Rodeo burger is definitely still around and it smacks.
[7820.71s -> 7835.83s]  I like it.
[7835.83s -> 7850.65s]  The reason the rodeo burger is great
[7850.65s -> 7855.48s]  kind of reminds me of my five guys order, which is...
[7856.89s -> 7857.69s]  Let me see if I get this right.
[7857.69s -> 7864.54s]  Rodeo burger is barbecue sauce, onion rings, and something else.
[7864.54s -> 7866.70s]  Barbecue sauce, onion rings, single patty.
[7866.70s -> 7870.09s]  What else is on it?
[7873.00s -> 7874.12s]  Is it bacon on it too?
[7874.12s -> 7874.52s]  No way.
[7875.78s -> 7877.86s]  It was tower three that you need to activate.
[7878.97s -> 7879.53s]  Oh, thank you.
[7880.09s -> 7882.66s]  I thought it was four.
[7883.46s -> 7885.06s]  Wait, the coins are numbered.
[7885.06s -> 7885.46s]  That's right.
[7885.46s -> 7885.78s]  I thought...
[7885.78s -> 7886.82s]  Yeah, I thought it didn't matter.
[7895.21s -> 7896.81s]  There's no cheese on it, right?
[7896.81s -> 7911.61s]  Please try the spicy honey chicken sandwich
[7911.61s -> 7913.85s]  with fried pickle chips from Wendy's.
[7913.85s -> 7915.37s]  Sounds like a lot, but I promise it's amazing.
[7917.53s -> 7920.01s]  I haven't been to Wendy's in a very long time.
[7930.33s -> 7932.97s]  Our meaning is gone.
[7932.97s -> 7938.41s]  Time arrived when you confront the final great one.
[7940.14s -> 7941.58s]  Could help you.
[7941.58s -> 7942.46s]  Oh, let's kill this person.
[7942.46s -> 7947.10s]  If first you could restore what has been lost.
[7947.10s -> 7950.94s]  Perhaps the spindles could prove a hero.
[7950.94s -> 7959.08s]  The narrator watched.
[7959.08s -> 7960.68s]  There's probably a remembrance thing here.
[7961.85s -> 7963.37s]  You hit so hard.
[7963.37s -> 7965.69s]  It's unbelievable how strong that was.
[7966.33s -> 7974.41s]  I'll get crit.
[7974.41s -> 7983.22s]  What do you got?
[7983.22s -> 7984.42s]  Translucent map.
[7988.82s -> 7989.32s]  Yeah.
[7989.86s -> 7990.74s]  Okay, there's...
[7990.74s -> 7991.70s]  Is it the...
[7991.70s -> 7992.58s]  No, not the shield.
[7992.58s -> 7993.62s]  Just the sword.
[7993.62s -> 8014.55s]  I want to put it on.
[8016.82s -> 8017.32s]  Damn it.
[8017.78s -> 8022.63s]  You're going to address the KFC mashed potato.
[8022.63s -> 8026.02s]  What are you talking about?
[8026.02s -> 8027.94s]  I love KFC, but I never go.
[8027.94s -> 8029.46s]  I have 21,000 souls.
[8029.46s -> 8029.94s]  Hold on.
[8056.57s -> 8057.45s]  KFC is good.
[8058.09s -> 8061.05s]  KFC falls into that same category for me, though,
[8061.05s -> 8063.21s]  of I never choose to go there,
[8063.21s -> 8065.93s]  but I will eat it and love it if you present it to me.
[8083.00s -> 8083.72s]  Like raisins.
[8084.28s -> 8087.86s]  Yeah, that's also pretty true.
[8091.00s -> 8091.72s]  Yeah.
[8092.34s -> 8094.26s]  I would eat a whole box of raisins right now
[8094.26s -> 8095.22s]  if it appeared in front of me.
[8095.78s -> 8096.82s]  Just boop.
[8096.82s -> 8098.01s]  They're right there.
[8098.01s -> 8099.29s]  I would eat the whole box,
[8099.29s -> 8101.30s]  but I'm never going to buy them.
[8101.30s -> 8102.58s]  I'll never purchase them.
[8102.58s -> 8112.58s]  All right, let's see what the boss is here.
[8124.84s -> 8125.64s]  Raisins are nice.
[8125.64s -> 8126.04s]  They're fine.
[8129.54s -> 8131.98s]  How do I get back down?
[8131.98s -> 8132.54s]  Let's drop.
[8133.10s -> 8148.54s]  I had some famous Elbertson egg salad for lunch.
[8148.54s -> 8152.23s]  Ooh, that's a good choice.
[8152.23s -> 8163.10s]  How do I get where I need to go?
[8163.10s -> 8191.13s]  This way?
[8191.13s -> 8191.77s]  Whoa.
[8191.77s -> 8201.54s]  I've only been able to use this one spell.
[8201.54s -> 8205.03s]  I wonder how the other ones are.
[8205.03s -> 8207.35s]  Oh, but I didn't even answer the question.
[8207.35s -> 8209.11s]  Somebody said, what's the worst fast food restaurant?
[8209.11s -> 8210.60s]  I don't, I don't think,
[8210.60s -> 8213.16s]  honestly, every bad fast food place in quotes,
[8215.48s -> 8217.08s]  there's a reason to eat there.
[8217.08s -> 8218.76s]  I know a lot of people,
[8218.76s -> 8222.14s]  oh, what about Jack in the Box?
[8222.14s -> 8224.22s]  Jack in the Box has these little tacos
[8225.08s -> 8226.12s]  and they are crack.
[8231.16s -> 8232.12s]  So it's probably, no,
[8232.12s -> 8234.68s]  but Sonic, the food is awful.
[8234.68s -> 8236.89s]  The food at Sonic is awful,
[8238.66s -> 8241.06s]  but all their drinks are so good
[8241.06s -> 8242.58s]  that I can't say that it sucks.
[8242.58s -> 8244.18s]  That would be not right.
[8251.06s -> 8252.82s]  I've eaten at Jack in the Box and gone,
[8252.82s -> 8255.90s]  that was pretty good with their little tacos.
[8274.17s -> 8278.20s]  I don't, I thought this was going to be
[8278.20s -> 8279.88s]  much simpler than I thought.
[8280.44s -> 8282.10s]  How do I get out of here?
[8282.10s -> 8285.22s]  What about White Castle?
[8286.25s -> 8290.01s]  I have never eaten at White Castle, truly.
[8291.99s -> 8295.27s]  I don't know if I've ever truly eaten that one.
[8296.36s -> 8297.80s]  Arby's, I've only eaten at Arby's
[8297.80s -> 8298.84s]  I think once in my life
[8298.84s -> 8299.72s]  and I didn't really like it.
[8299.72s -> 8301.32s]  So I haven't really given it that much of a chance.
[8303.50s -> 8304.06s]  I'm lost.
[8315.70s -> 8316.98s]  Ronald McDonald or the King?
[8316.98s -> 8317.94s]  Be honest, please.
[8317.94s -> 8318.82s]  It's not about the food.
[8318.82s -> 8320.34s]  Who's the better, oh, Ronald McDonald all day.
[8321.42s -> 8322.62s]  Ronald McDonald all day.
[8329.06s -> 8331.30s]  I don't even need to see who Ronald McDonald is fighting.
[8331.86s -> 8332.98s]  He wins every time.
[8348.14s -> 8349.90s]  Ronald McDonald versus God.
[8355.19s -> 8356.07s]  Aren't they the same thing?
[8369.51s -> 8370.23s]  Amen.
[8371.91s -> 8373.27s]  All right, where am I going?
[8373.27s -> 8375.27s]  I don't know how to get to this place.
[8381.00s -> 8381.96s]  I saw it from a distance,
[8381.96s -> 8393.02s]  but I don't know how to get over there.
[8393.02s -> 8395.26s]  Dude, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[8395.26s -> 8402.76s]  I need to go look from above again.
[8402.76s -> 8406.17s]  Why do I feel like this is a different area?
[8406.17s -> 8414.12s]  I feel like I'm stuck here.
[8414.36s -> 8416.14s]  How do I get out of here?
[8416.14s -> 8426.84s]  This is why I dropped the coins
[8426.84s -> 8427.80s]  and the coins are gone
[8427.80s -> 8429.32s]  because I reloaded the area.
[8429.32s -> 8446.79s]  I found it.
[8446.79s -> 8473.80s]  I think I got it.
[8473.80s -> 8486.36s]  Yeah, Grimace was cool, too.
[8486.36s -> 8487.82s]  They were all cool.
[8487.82s -> 8491.64s]  All right, is it that way?
[8491.64s -> 8493.16s]  It's that way.
[8493.16s -> 8495.00s]  All right, so I got to go down that way.
[8495.00s -> 8500.57s]  Grimace was the man.
[8500.57s -> 8501.13s]  You know what I mean?
[8501.13s -> 8502.01s]  Grimace was awesome.
[8505.78s -> 8507.38s]  One of my favorite Grimace lines.
[8507.38s -> 8509.51s]  I'll never forget it.
[8509.51s -> 8511.03s]  God, remember what you remember?
[8511.03s -> 8511.90s]  Hey, Ronald.
[8513.34s -> 8517.45s]  Fucking legendary saying.
[8517.45s -> 8522.26s]  Just sends chills up and down my spine.
[8522.34s -> 8532.73s]  I'm just like, God, Grimace is a fucking man.
[8532.73s -> 8534.49s]  Remember what he used to say?
[8535.45s -> 8537.85s]  Ronald, I love classic shakes.
[8539.37s -> 8541.18s]  Just God damn, man.
[8541.18s -> 8544.22s]  He's such a cool motherfucker.
[8544.22s -> 8545.34s]  Where am I going?
[8545.34s -> 8546.30s]  I'm sorry.
[8546.30s -> 8547.58s]  Where am I going?
[8550.09s -> 8551.53s]  I need to go that way.
[8555.42s -> 8563.96s]  Don't kill me.
[8563.96s -> 8564.92s]  Down here.
[8566.60s -> 8570.46s]  Okay, I need to get there.
[8570.46s -> 8573.98s]  How do I even get over?
[8573.98s -> 8579.32s]  Down here, down there, straight through there.
[8579.32s -> 8581.83s]  And up there.
[8581.83s -> 8582.55s]  Let's go.
[8585.62s -> 8589.06s]  No one, and I mean, no one knows what you're talking about.
[8589.06s -> 8591.85s]  Somebody does.
[8591.85s -> 8595.06s]  You don't remember the classic Grimace lines?
[8595.06s -> 8628.63s]  Is this right?
[8638.66s -> 8641.98s]  No, I already lost.
[8641.98s -> 8645.82s]  Yeah, it's the fucking Zelda forest.
[8645.82s -> 8649.16s]  What are you linking me?
[8649.16s -> 8649.80s]  What is this?
[8649.80s -> 8665.62s]  Hold on.
[8665.62s -> 8666.58s]  Bony fingers.
[8666.58s -> 8670.65s]  What is this?
[8670.65s -> 8671.85s]  I don't know how you do it.
[8672.41s -> 8675.45s]  I put together some really impressive deals.
[8675.45s -> 8678.17s]  But this thing you've pulled off, it's amazing.
[8678.97s -> 8681.13s]  A big and tasty for just a dollar.
[8681.13s -> 8681.85s]  How do you do it?
[8681.85s -> 8682.65s]  What's your secret?
[8686.98s -> 8688.34s]  He didn't even say anything.
[8688.34s -> 8690.10s]  He didn't even say anything.
[8690.10s -> 8692.10s]  No, that's not the classic Grimace line.
[8702.82s -> 8703.86s]  We could own this town.
[8704.98s -> 8705.70s]  Of course we will.
[8706.42s -> 8708.41s]  He didn't even say anything in this commercial.
[8708.41s -> 8709.37s]  He doesn't even talk.
[8709.37s -> 8711.37s]  Why did you link this to me?
[8717.40s -> 8718.20s]  You know Grimace.
[8720.94s -> 8723.16s]  What the fuck?
[8723.16s -> 8724.60s]  He never spoke?
[8724.60s -> 8725.56s]  Yes, he did.
[8725.56s -> 8726.84s]  Grimace had a voice.
[8729.67s -> 8730.71s]  Grimace had a voice.
[8730.71s -> 8746.84s]  And I know it.
[8746.84s -> 8748.36s]  Did Grimace walk this way?
[8748.36s -> 8749.72s]  No, he walked this way.
[8749.72s -> 8750.28s]  There it is.
[8767.11s -> 8768.79s]  I knew you liked happy endings.
[8797.06s -> 8797.94s]  What the hell?
[8797.94s -> 8803.64s]  I got to get out of here.
[8803.64s -> 8806.63s]  Barney rubble.
[8806.63s -> 8807.27s]  All right.
[8807.27s -> 8809.94s]  Where is this place?
[8809.94s -> 8811.38s]  I hate getting lost.
[8811.38s -> 8815.18s]  I was too busy laughing at Grimace.
[8815.18s -> 8854.89s]  And I don't remember where I am.
[8854.89s -> 8855.77s]  Am I going the right way?
[8870.01s -> 8883.75s]  I'm out of stamina.
[8886.89s -> 8888.09s]  Get off me, Donnie.
[8888.09s -> 8892.74s]  If I die right now, I'm going to do a huge Grimace.
[8892.74s -> 8902.71s]  It's going to be the biggest Grimace you've ever heard.
[8902.71s -> 8903.51s]  Oh my god.
[8903.51s -> 8903.91s]  I don't want to.
[8903.91s -> 8904.87s]  I actually don't want to do it.
[8904.87s -> 8906.39s]  I just said that to be an idiot.
[8906.39s -> 8907.75s]  It was just me making a dumb joke.
[8907.75s -> 8909.67s]  I actually don't want to do a Grimace voice.
[8909.67s -> 8911.85s]  Just get away from me.
[8911.85s -> 8912.73s]  Get away from me.
[8912.73s -> 8917.88s]  Hey, boys and girls.
[8917.88s -> 8919.48s]  Everybody loves a McDonald's.
[8920.36s -> 8921.32s]  Free me shakes.
[8933.59s -> 8934.87s]  I don't know where to go now.
[8934.87s -> 8938.15s]  I got chills from that, dude.
[8948.78s -> 8950.62s]  Get the hell away from me.
[8950.62s -> 8963.43s]  Fuck, I forgot where to go.
[8964.23s -> 8966.15s]  Oh no, I hate this place.
[8966.15s -> 8967.67s]  I was right there.
[8967.67s -> 8969.00s]  It's I have to go.
[8969.00s -> 8969.40s]  No, no, no, no.
[8969.40s -> 8970.04s]  I know.
[8970.04s -> 8974.66s]  I got to go to where I fought the lady with the wings.
[8974.66s -> 8975.22s]  Where?
[8975.22s -> 8979.43s]  Fuck if I remember where that is.
[8979.43s -> 8982.79s]  Where is somewhere like in the midsection here, right?
[8982.79s -> 8983.75s]  It's above.
[8983.75s -> 8989.48s]  It's like over.
[8989.48s -> 8990.36s]  Where is it?
[8990.36s -> 8991.00s]  I don't remember.
[8991.00s -> 8992.36s]  Everything's green and foggy.
[8992.36s -> 8994.36s]  I can't see anything.
[8994.36s -> 8996.12s]  Everything is green and foggy.
[8996.12s -> 8997.80s]  I where's my visibility?
[8997.80s -> 8998.60s]  I have no visibility.
[8998.60s -> 9000.26s]  I don't know where I'm going.
[9000.26s -> 9002.02s]  Where is that place where I fought that lady?
[9004.49s -> 9006.33s]  You've played this game for like 10 hours.
[9006.33s -> 9010.25s]  I haven't played in the Zelda forest for 10 hours.
[9014.89s -> 9017.93s]  Everything's foggy and everything's disconnected.
[9018.49s -> 9019.45s]  I know I have to go down.
[9020.89s -> 9021.77s]  Where is that?
[9021.77s -> 9022.57s]  Where do I fight that lady?
[9025.72s -> 9037.50s]  That way.
[9037.50s -> 9041.75s]  Has there ever been a rogue's gallery like McDonald's?
[9041.75s -> 9043.96s]  No.
[9043.96s -> 9044.44s]  Who comes?
[9044.44s -> 9045.32s]  Nobody even comes close.
[9073.94s -> 9075.06s]  Those of you that are wondering what happened,
[9075.06s -> 9090.34s]  I was reading chat and walked in a complete circle.
[9090.34s -> 9091.78s]  All right, let's try this shit again.
[9091.78s -> 9092.74s]  No more messing around.
[9092.74s -> 9096.25s]  No more grimace bullshit.
[9096.25s -> 9108.23s]  Just get me over there.
[9108.31s -> 9109.35s]  Is grimace in hell?
[9110.94s -> 9112.70s]  I think grimace is still alive.
[9114.52s -> 9115.32s]  So no.
[9115.32s -> 9123.64s]  And then it's this way, right?
[9123.64s -> 9137.56s]  Oh my god.
[9137.56s -> 9138.84s]  I have to do this.
[9138.84s -> 9166.92s]  Didn't even get hit.
[9166.92s -> 9167.64s]  Do a poll.
[9167.64s -> 9168.12s]  Do a poll.
[9168.12s -> 9168.84s]  All right, do a poll.
[9168.84s -> 9194.47s]  Is grimace in hell?
[9194.47s -> 9195.27s]  Don't.
[9195.27s -> 9196.39s]  Seriously, dude.
[9196.39s -> 9199.22s]  I just want to get out of here.
[9199.22s -> 9205.51s]  Grimace is not.
[9205.51s -> 9207.51s]  And the fact that you would say that grimace is,
[9209.14s -> 9210.10s]  it just saddens me.
[9210.10s -> 9214.46s]  It just disappoints me.
[9214.46s -> 9218.38s]  Like just it just it you saying that grimace is in hell
[9218.38s -> 9219.58s]  is disappointing to me.
[9235.05s -> 9236.33s]  Yeah, what did he even do?
[9238.06s -> 9239.66s]  What did why is grimace in hell?
[9239.66s -> 9240.62s]  What did grimace do?
[9245.32s -> 9247.56s]  He's a capitalist mascot.
[9247.56s -> 9255.96s]  Grimace is a nice is a nice character.
[9255.96s -> 9258.20s]  Grimace is not in hell.
[9258.76s -> 9260.82s]  I this is a long poll.
[9280.07s -> 9283.26s]  Okay, here we go.
[9283.26s -> 9288.70s]  Who is grimace?
[9289.34s -> 9297.19s]  The big purple guy from McDonald's.
[9297.19s -> 9302.79s]  If you're curious, he sounds like this.
[9302.79s -> 9303.27s]  Gotcha.
[9303.27s -> 9306.70s]  I know a lot of you just muted the stream.
[9306.70s -> 9307.90s]  Well, did it for no reason.
[9308.54s -> 9317.66s]  Watch out for bad game design.
[9317.66s -> 9319.10s]  Avoid curiosity.
[9319.10s -> 9326.87s]  Is the squirrel?
[9326.87s -> 9340.68s]  All right.
[9340.68s -> 9341.40s]  What is it?
[9341.40s -> 9349.74s]  What's the verdict?
[9349.74s -> 9352.46s]  63% of you think that you know what?
[9352.46s -> 9358.20s]  At least I'm happy that there's like almost 40% of you
[9358.20s -> 9359.58s]  have not lost your minds.
[9360.98s -> 9362.98s]  Something amazing has spawned.
[9364.26s -> 9366.26s]  No, you silly.
[9366.26s -> 9368.58s]  Though you sure are swell.
[9368.58s -> 9370.18s]  When your cycle started,
[9370.18s -> 9373.70s]  an innocent, uncorrupted NPC also appeared.
[9373.78s -> 9376.66s]  That hasn't happened for ages.
[9377.70s -> 9380.10s]  Hey, I have a fun idea.
[9380.10s -> 9382.10s]  How about you find them
[9382.10s -> 9385.06s]  and bring them a little gift from me?
[9385.06s -> 9385.86s]  This guy's weird.
[9385.86s -> 9387.54s]  An innocent wouldn't be able to stay
[9387.54s -> 9390.42s]  innocent long in this messed up world.
[9392.26s -> 9395.29s]  What the hell is that?
[9395.85s -> 9405.43s]  Is this Dex?
[9405.99s -> 9406.23s]  No.
[9407.03s -> 9418.98s]  What is this?
[9418.98s -> 9431.54s]  Give it to an innocent?
[9435.90s -> 9439.69s]  What so many cycles had crumbled.
[9439.69s -> 9442.09s]  Might it yet be restored?
[9442.09s -> 9444.87s]  Dare the narrator hope.
[9444.87s -> 9445.35s]  Oh, shit.
[9449.80s -> 9451.48s]  Keep of the Stolen Crown.
[9455.61s -> 9456.73s]  Very interesting.
[9458.94s -> 9461.72s]  Very interesting.
[9461.72s -> 9463.24s]  So interesting, in fact,
[9463.24s -> 9465.96s]  that we're gonna have to finish this another time.
[9465.96s -> 9475.56s]  I like this area.
[9475.56s -> 9489.27s]  Good fast food stream.
[9489.27s -> 9493.50s]  They're all fast food streams.
[9493.50s -> 9494.86s]  I just hide the fact that they're not.
[9503.93s -> 9505.29s]  But yeah, thanks for watching.
[9505.29s -> 9511.66s]  That was a really, really fun day.
[9511.66s -> 9514.50s]  Wild Hearts seems pretty fun.
[9514.50s -> 9515.78s]  I might play some more of it.
[9515.78s -> 9517.90s]  I don't know if I'll play it on stream,
[9517.90s -> 9520.46s]  but it's definitely something I think I'm interested enough
[9520.46s -> 9521.74s]  to get through some of it.
[9523.99s -> 9526.47s]  Not that it matters, but thanks again to EA
[9526.47s -> 9528.87s]  and the developers of that game
[9528.87s -> 9535.58s]  and for sponsoring that part of the stream a few hours ago.
[9535.58s -> 9536.62s]  And thanks for watching
[9536.62s -> 9538.46s]  and thanks for sticking around during that.
[9540.68s -> 9541.32s]  Thank you.
[9541.32s -> 9544.36s]  And then this was fun, too.
[9544.36s -> 9546.54s]  A lot of nice time tonight.
[9546.54s -> 9550.94s]  I had a great time.
[9550.94s -> 9554.46s]  So the next time you see me is going to be...
[9556.31s -> 9557.99s]  I want to finish this game.
[9557.99s -> 9561.74s]  We probably only have like a couple hours left.
[9561.74s -> 9570.98s]  Let's say Monday.
[9570.98s -> 9572.41s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9572.41s -> 9574.66s]  No, I got that wrong.
[9574.66s -> 9578.12s]  Sunday is technically...
[9578.12s -> 9579.00s]  Wait, no, no, no.
[9579.00s -> 9584.90s]  Tomorrow would technically be Sunday, right?
[9584.90s -> 9585.70s]  Technically.
[9585.70s -> 9590.71s]  So yeah, we'll finish it up Sunday.
[9590.71s -> 9597.82s]  And after we finish this, we'll pivot to something else.
[9597.82s -> 9598.30s]  We'll see.
[9598.30s -> 9608.34s]  Have a great evening.
[9608.34s -> 9611.69s]  See you all soon.
[9611.69s -> 9614.36s]  Let me just make sure I save the game.
[9614.36s -> 9617.18s]  I think it saves automatically.
[9617.18s -> 9622.68s]  Yes, it does.
[9622.68s -> 9629.24s]  Same time.
[9629.24s -> 9630.84s]  Big huge shout out to Vinny.
[9633.48s -> 9636.52s]  Vinny made that way, way, way more fun and way more interesting for me.
[9636.52s -> 9639.27s]  So thanks, Vinny.
[9639.27s -> 9648.28s]  Take care of yourselves.
[9648.28s -> 9652.02s]  Get some sleep or good morning, whatever one it is.
[9652.02s -> 9653.30s]  I'm going to go get some food.
[9653.30s -> 9666.14s]  Call your mother?
[9666.14s -> 9668.98s]  Well, I mean, maybe not right now.
[9668.98s -> 9670.71s]  Might be late.
[9670.71s -> 9677.86s]  We'll see you Sunday.
[9677.86s -> 9681.40s]  Goodbye.
[9681.40s -> 9682.44s]  See you later.
[9682.44s -> 9742.58s]  Take care.
[9742.58s -> 9743.46s]  Yeah, that was a little late.
[9744.26s -> 9744.76s]  Whoops.
[9747.50s -> 9748.00s]  See you tomorrow.
[9756.01s -> 9768.60s]  Tomorrow as in Sunday.
[9769.24s -> 9771.64s]  It's technically Saturday night right now.
[9771.64s -> 9775.80s]  So like in a day and a half, a day, a day and a half, two days.
[9776.68s -> 9778.71s]  See you later.
