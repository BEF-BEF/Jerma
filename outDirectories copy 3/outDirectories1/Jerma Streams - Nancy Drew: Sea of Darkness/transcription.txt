[1.66s -> 32.31s]  Oh, shit. There we go. Hi. What's happening? How are the cheese toasties? They were
[33.27s -> 41.61s]  absolutely delicious. Before we get started today, with uh, you know, Drew Crew.
[42.89s -> 50.78s]  That's not even a phrase I coined. I saw that in chat yesterday. I was like, that's pretty good.
[50.78s -> 61.91s]  Drew Crew. I like it. And to solve some mysteries. I've been told this one's actually good. Now,
[61.91s -> 67.61s]  I don't know where that stands on the Nancy Drew tier list. Oh, fuck. I just gave it away. Well,
[67.61s -> 73.37s]  you can see, you can see the title. What do you, what else would be Drew Crew? Oh yeah. We're
[73.37s -> 81.34s]  doing Drew Crew. What else could that be? We, are we playing uh, Price is Right? What else could it
[81.34s -> 90.55s]  be? Uh, this apparently is a good one. I'm going to hold all judgment until we play it, you know.
[94.52s -> 110.04s]  50% of the stream's income should go to that guy. 50%. That's, that's not gonna happen. Anyways,
[119.67s -> 123.99s]  one thing before we go. Not go. I mean, like, go as in like step on the gas, not hit the brakes.
[124.79s -> 131.19s]  I have just opened a channel in the Discord. Two channels, actually. One of them doesn't work yet.
[132.74s -> 139.54s]  They are at the New Year's Eve, worst streams, worst of the year awards. We're gonna do that
[139.54s -> 146.39s]  again this year. The categories are up. If you want to see what you can possibly nominate,
[147.11s -> 156.10s]  the list of what they are are there. That channel is open for discussion. There's a separate,
[156.10s -> 162.38s]  just submit a nomination, which the rules aren't there yet. Uh, I kind of want to give like a day
[162.38s -> 169.34s]  or so or like just for people to discuss and collect some of the data. There's a category
[169.34s -> 174.30s]  on there that's not really a category, but it's something that I want to do. Um, if it's possible,
[175.10s -> 182.54s]  I would like for whoever wants to embarrass me, go for it. Find all the times or specific times
[182.54s -> 187.42s]  where I have told a lie. Because I'd like to see, I'd like to, you have to look in the mirror
[187.42s -> 191.82s]  sometimes. I want a full compilation of every time I've ever lied on this stream.
[196.15s -> 201.99s]  Just play a 15 straight minute video of every clip every time I've said something that was,
[201.99s -> 214.30s]  wasn't true. The video is going to be too long. Well, we can condense it. I'd like to try. 15
[214.30s -> 221.35s]  minutes. Yeah, you can shrink that down. You can shrink 150 hours down to 15 minutes. You just need
[221.35s -> 230.47s]  like two words, three, one sentence. You know, like I will play ace attorney. That's not even
[230.47s -> 235.45s]  two seconds. You think I've lied more than 150 times on this string. I don't think so.
[246.42s -> 253.90s]  He's probably lying right now. I said Drew crew first. Don't let this man's greed fool you.
[254.62s -> 262.87s]  Speaking of Drew crew. Yeah. Yes. We're, we're playing Nancy Drew in the sea of darkness.
[264.89s -> 273.86s]  I, this is what people want. It's just, this is what they want me to do. I, I was all right
[273.86s -> 281.30s]  with maybe just doing one, but I did buy like seven. This probably isn't even a Nancy Drew
[281.30s -> 288.02s]  stream. Well, what do you think this is? A screenshot? Here we go. Get ready for Nancy
[288.02s -> 297.43s]  Drew, a sea of darkness. I'm going amateur. Uh, can this be changed on the fly? Because the last
[297.43s -> 303.77s]  time I got really stuck, I just, I, it doesn't matter. I'll just cheat more challenging. No
[303.77s -> 309.56s]  hints. Basic task list. Yeah. I'll just, it doesn't matter. I'll just look up the answer if I can't
[309.56s -> 333.11s]  get it. Uh, why are we all cheering? What, what is what happened? What just happened? Everyone was
[333.11s -> 348.46s]  like, yeah, here it comes. Oh, it's getting close. Uh, I got Ford. I got you contacting him through
[348.46s -> 356.22s]  a friend of mine. I think you did some good sleuthing work with her in Scotland. Not too
[356.22s -> 361.58s]  long ago. First some background. Yours truly. You could officially call me a locator of fine goods
[361.58s -> 366.94s]  per se. Can either condense this down. This is too much. This is too huge of a letter. Nobody can
[366.94s -> 372.46s]  write this small and this legible. You guys ever tried to write a letter and not on lined paper,
[372.46s -> 381.45s]  by the way? Yeah. Right. Yeah. You can write like that. I actually do though. You cannot
[381.45s -> 389.69s]  write that perfect on paper. That's not lined paper. No way. No one writes letters anymore.
[389.69s -> 399.34s]  Yeah. They just write emails, but still I literally can. No, you can't go back for the boots.
[399.66s -> 404.46s]  Yeah. Anyways, here's some background on yours. Truly. Yeah. Yeah. I'm currently I'm in Iceland
[405.02s -> 412.62s]  in a small town called skip brought when I first arrived the, the here. Well, okay. I don't know.
[413.99s -> 420.09s]  KO legacy just gave 10 community subs. Thank you. KO legacy. Appreciate that. Thanks for the 10 drop.
[420.89s -> 438.39s]  German just has bad handwriting. No, we haven't even started yet. I was about to go get paper
[438.39s -> 444.31s]  and show you. No, I can't. No, we have, I, what's the, okay. I helped to restore the ship. All right.
[444.31s -> 451.06s]  Who cares about any of this? Wait, long staying rumor about a treasure concealed somewhere.
[452.47s -> 454.79s]  You want to try? I'm going to try to do this. I'm going to try to do this letter.
[455.75s -> 522.31s]  All right. I'll be right back. All right. Hold on. I got the camera on the tripod now.
[523.35s -> 529.08s]  Do I even have a pen in here? I'm supposed to be playing Nancy Drew. That's not what I'm doing.
[529.08s -> 555.70s]  I think all my room is clean. I need a pen though. Maybe I got a pen and this is on
[555.70s -> 572.50s]  perfect computer paper, by the way. You got one? Open the Xbox. I just need this much room.
[572.50s -> 585.10s]  All right. I'm ready. Uh, computer paper right here. I just need to be able to see what I'm
[585.10s -> 593.08s]  looking at. Missed bits. Hold on. I'll get it. Okay. Okay. Now, um, I need a fucking pen. How
[593.08s -> 648.86s]  do I have an office with no pens in it? We're fucking running around. Okay. I got it. Wait.
[652.62s -> 669.11s]  You guys get it. I'm going to have to use the webcam mic. Is it plugged in? All right. Hold
[669.11s -> 688.71s]  on. I'm, I'm almost ready. Do it on an overhead projector. I don't, I don't have an overhead
[688.71s -> 704.60s]  projector. I have to get this right. You're a loser. What? Get my coffee out of the way.
[706.82s -> 713.94s]  All right. There's no bank statements here, right? I have to pick up the stack of computer
[713.94s -> 730.62s]  paper and here's my bank statement. All right. Are we ready? Can you see it? Can you guys not see
[730.62s -> 764.14s]  this? Uh, it's not, uh, what is that? I can't even see. What is that? An image up? What the
[764.14s -> 773.43s]  fuck is this? What is this aiming at? Why is this so blown up? That's not the, no, it's not the
[773.43s -> 784.06s]  chair leg. Oh, it's up there. Why is it up there? Why is my hand so big? Why do I have a monster
[784.06s -> 803.99s]  hand? Why do I have such a big hand? Hey. Oh, look at those bones. Oh, what is that? Okay. My hand,
[803.99s -> 809.62s]  you know, you know, when you go to the Halloween store and you see like the look at the spooky hand
[809.62s -> 820.71s]  with real animatronics inside. That's what this is. Um, okay. Hold on. This has to be over here.
[820.71s -> 855.14s]  Oh, I thought found the computer paper. Found it. What? Xbox is on. Okay. I can see it. Move this
[855.14s -> 864.55s]  over here. Shrink it a little and then we got to turn it like this. No, I have to do this the way
[864.55s -> 877.13s]  that I know it. I can't see what this says. Pale hands. There's no white balance on this camera.
[877.85s -> 897.32s]  Don't you understand? I don't have any fucking white balance on it. Can you see? Okay, good.
[897.32s -> 908.66s]  Let's go. Let me get myself a little reminder. Do laundry later. Okay. Good. I got your contact
[909.30s -> 917.75s]  with St. Nancy. I need fucking, I need writing music. Okay. Best music for writing.
[918.55s -> 929.38s]  He's jacked. By the way, can we just talk about this fucking walnut desk? Immaculate.
[930.39s -> 939.75s]  Except for the couple places where I hit my hand with the VR controllers. Best music for writing.
[940.39s -> 951.37s]  Two hours of amazing writing and study playlist. What does that sound like? That sounds good.
[954.76s -> 970.78s]  All right. Let me see if I can get this. I need to make this bigger. Thank dear. Okay. Nancy,
[977.21s -> 987.05s]  Nancy, I got your contact info. Get out of there. I'm going to try my hardest
[993.14s -> 996.82s]  and don't make fun of the way that I hold a pencil. I know I got shit for this since I was
[996.82s -> 1003.14s]  like the sixth grade. Okay. This is how I hold a pencil. I don't go like this. Oh, look at me.
[1003.30s -> 1022.26s]  Hold a pencil like that. You got to put on the other microphone. Can you guys hear me? I don't
[1022.26s -> 1036.01s]  know why nobody can hear me. No, you can't. Hold on. You're not alone. What? Add audio device.
[1042.39s -> 1064.90s]  Audio output. What was that? What was that? No, audio input is what I need. What was that?
[1064.90s -> 1071.54s]  What? I don't even know what that was. Was that the music? I haven't even started writing. Hold on.
[1071.54s -> 1091.46s]  God damn it. Hold on. Audio input. Audio input capture. There we go. Hello? Choose your
[1091.46s -> 1095.80s]  input. Dude, this shit. I can't even capture the fucking microphone. Why?
[1097.00s -> 1108.02s]  I can't. I can't. Why can I not capture the microphone? All right. I'm writing. I'm going
[1108.02s -> 1123.30s]  for it. Who cares? Fuck it. Ready? Here we go. Nancy, right? I drank like a large coffee.
[1123.30s -> 1138.41s]  Wait. This is going to be... Nancy, you can't even see. Look at... You can't even see it. I
[1138.41s -> 1154.60s]  got to zoom in it. It's so out of focus. I can't even read it. Enhance. I'm going to try to enhance
[1154.60s -> 1185.66s]  it. Hold on. Hold on. I need to enhance it. This camera sucks. Who cares? This camera sucks.
[1186.22s -> 1189.50s]  It doesn't matter. Nancy, I got... Okay. Let me see if I can get this correct. I got your
[1189.50s -> 1220.87s]  contact info through a friend of mine. I got your contact info through a friend. Friend of mine,
[1220.87s -> 1244.18s]  Mara... Mara Chisholm. Is that right? So far? I got your contact info through a friend of mine,
[1244.18s -> 1272.68s]  Mara Chisholm. I think you did some good sleuthing work with her in Scotland not too long ago.
[1272.68s -> 1285.90s]  Okay. Am I actually going to write this? Why don't I just take a script? I'm not going to
[1285.90s -> 1300.34s]  write this whole letter. I'm not writing the whole letter. Who the fuck wants me to do this?
[1301.53s -> 1308.79s]  Nobody wants me to do this. Nobody wants me to write the entire letter. You want me to write the
[1308.79s -> 1334.17s]  entire letter? Where's some background on yours for a moment? Where's your background on yours truly?
[1334.89s -> 1353.80s]  You can officially call me a locator fucker. A locator of fine goods. All right, now here's
[1353.80s -> 1361.00s]  the real... What if I just drop this into somebody's mailbox? Be like, what the fuck is this person
[1361.00s -> 1373.03s]  talking about? Send this to a friend of mine with no return address? Send this to Burger Boy. He's
[1373.03s -> 1385.32s]  going to be like, what in the name of fucking God is happening? Per se. Nice things get lost.
[1394.01s -> 1405.19s]  You would think this person was insane. If I write this whole letter, I have to give it to somebody.
[1412.82s -> 1416.74s]  I have to finish the letter. All right, once I finish the letter, we can do something else.
[1417.54s -> 1425.80s]  I didn't even... I didn't even get one second into the game too. All right, I gotta hurry up.
[1425.80s -> 1431.96s]  I'm on two sentences. Get lost. Nice things get lost. Nice things stay buried for a while.
[1432.92s -> 1451.59s]  Nice things get... For a while. I find the nice things. I get a piece of the... What? The pea?
[1451.59s -> 1455.67s]  The pie? The piece of the pie? I get it. I get the nice things. I get a piece of the pie.
[1470.68s -> 1476.28s]  Okay, I get the nice things. I get a piece of the pie. In other words, I'm a treasure hunter.
[1477.00s -> 1498.66s]  Is that a new paragraph? In other words, that's so much space. God damn it. In other words,
[1498.66s -> 1507.46s]  I'm a treasure hunter. I have so much more to do. I have so much more to do.

[2025.13s -> 2027.13s]  This is how they had to do it.
[2034.96s -> 2038.93s]  There's no other way to do that.
[2038.93s -> 2043.28s]  Should I do more than one?
[2043.28s -> 2065.79s]  A bunch of kool-aid.

[2141.91s -> 2146.22s]  I didn't even know what I looked like until right now.
[2153.68s -> 2156.98s]  That's from smooshing my mouth.
[2156.98s -> 2158.98s]  You're a joker.
[2158.98s -> 2166.66s]  Nancy fucking Drew.
[2166.66s -> 2171.21s]  I haven't even played a minute of it.
[2171.21s -> 2183.24s]  You don't know what you look like.
[2183.24s -> 2187.24s]  I just, I ran in and grabbed one of Kim's lipsticks.
[2187.24s -> 2192.17s]  Look, look, look, look.
[2198.74s -> 2200.74s]  That's a little kid.

[2207.74s -> 2221.31s]  It's, how was I eating it?
[2221.31s -> 2223.31s]  No, that's, it was on kind of normally
[2223.31s -> 2226.31s]  and then I smooshed my face into the desk.
[2226.31s -> 2228.31s]  Is it still, yeah, it's still there.
[2228.31s -> 2230.31s]  What do you think, it disappeared?
[2230.31s -> 2233.81s]  You got it in mommy's lipstick drawer.
[2233.81s -> 2247.93s]  Uh, okay, I, um,
[2247.93s -> 2249.93s]  What do I wanna do? I can't leave again.
[2249.93s -> 2251.93s]  I've left like six times.
[2251.93s -> 2255.42s]  I've left so many times.
[2257.42s -> 2259.42s]  It's music.
[2259.42s -> 2262.42s]  Okay, I need to compose myself here.
[2262.42s -> 2266.50s]  Oh my God, why did you give that many subs?
[2266.50s -> 2272.98s]  Jerma sucks just gave 61 subs?
[2272.98s -> 2278.14s]  Holy shit, dude.
[2278.14s -> 2280.90s]  What are you doing?
[2280.90s -> 2288.81s]  That's a lot, thank you for the huge sub drop.
[2288.81s -> 2290.81s]  That's a lot of money, thank you.
[2290.81s -> 2293.37s]  Dude, go gaming.
[2295.31s -> 2299.31s]  Crackdota five community subs, ten actually.
[2299.31s -> 2302.31s]  Kazzy five community subs, thank you, all of you.
[2312.03s -> 2315.03s]  Thank you Jerma sucks, seriously, Jesus.
[2315.03s -> 2319.03s]  Raphrod, ten community subs from Raphrod, thank you Raphrod.
[2329.03s -> 2332.03s]  Am I gonna just stream like this?
[2332.03s -> 2335.03s]  When I take a break, I'll get it on.
[2341.70s -> 2350.09s]  I, I'll just wait, I'll take a, I just, let me in one minute.
[2350.09s -> 2353.09s]  What do people in town think of the dis, I don't even know what's going on.
[2353.09s -> 2355.09s]  We shall,
[2355.09s -> 2358.09s]  What's with the, why's the audio so low?
[2362.09s -> 2365.09s]  Leave it on, no, I can't.
[2366.09s -> 2370.09s]  Without a body, you're still convinced he faked his death?
[2370.09s -> 2373.09s]  Yep, which apparently doesn't take a lot of work in Iceland.
[2373.09s -> 2376.26s]  I do have it all over my hands.
[2376.26s -> 2380.26s]  Oh my god, what the hell, what's going on, what, oh my gosh, Coke, are you serious?
[2380.26s -> 2384.32s]  Okay.
[2384.32s -> 2385.32s]  I'll let you go.
[2385.32s -> 2387.88s]  Stay warm.
[2387.88s -> 2390.88s]  Okay, so, explore the town, search the ship.
[2390.88s -> 2396.37s]  How do you walk?
[2396.37s -> 2398.37s]  Alright, explore the town, I wanna go check out the ship.
[2398.37s -> 2404.66s]  Spamming it in channel points, oh yeah, I have to do channel points, I forgot.
[2404.66s -> 2409.12s]  What about the rope?
[2409.12s -> 2411.12s]  The gangway is missing, there's no way on board.
[2411.12s -> 2413.12s]  I need a new gangway?
[2413.12s -> 2414.36s]  What?
[2414.36s -> 2416.98s]  Oh my god, what is this, what is this, oh my god, are you serious?
[2416.98s -> 2417.98s]  Coke gaming.
[2417.98s -> 2427.82s]  So I, I need a, I need a, I need a new one.
[2427.82s -> 2432.23s]  Alright, I, I have to go.
[2432.23s -> 2438.23s]  I have to like, not like leave, I have to like, this is like, I feel like, I don't know why, I feel like this is like seeping, I feel like this is seeping into my bloodstream.
[2438.23s -> 2440.23s]  I really do.
[2440.23s -> 2442.23s]  I really feel like this is like seeping into my bloodstream.
[2442.23s -> 2443.23s]  Alright, I'll be back.
[2443.23s -> 2577.42s]  Give me the...
[2580.11s -> 2583.11s]  It's not, it's not working.
[2583.11s -> 2588.11s]  It's not working, I just like ate, like I just ate like a person.
[2588.11s -> 2591.11s]  What did I eat right here?
[2591.11s -> 2592.11s]  Get off!
[2592.11s -> 2598.51s]  I just went hunting.
[2598.51s -> 2606.50s]  Like in a pack.
[2606.50s -> 2610.38s]  Flaming hot Cheetos.
[2610.38s -> 2616.38s]  If anybody asks, I really like flaming hot Cheetos to the fact that I'm permanently stained.
[2616.38s -> 2628.68s]  I'm willing to do this because like, fuck it, who cares, ready?
[2628.68s -> 2635.07s]  I'm just gonna pretend like I'm shit-faced on like really, really heavy red wine.
[2635.07s -> 2657.41s]  What, what, what does this mean?
[2657.41s -> 2659.84s]  What does this mean?
[2659.84s -> 2671.40s]  Why, oh that's from, okay.
[2671.40s -> 2728.58s]  Uh, yeah, so if you guys, I'd stick on.
[2728.58s -> 2730.58s]  I drank three of them.
[2730.58s -> 2739.93s]  Is someone on my camera?
[2739.93s -> 2743.28s]  Hey, thanks.
[2743.28s -> 2745.65s]  Thanks a lot, Coke gaming.
[2745.65s -> 2755.85s]  Let's go.
[2755.85s -> 2760.84s]  So what do you guys want to do?
[2760.84s -> 2763.27s]  I can barely do anything.
[2763.27s -> 2769.27s]  I really don't want to lie to you guys, but I seriously fucking can't do shit right now.
[2769.27s -> 2785.33s]  I, we were gonna play Nancy Drew, but I don't even, I don't even remember what the first part of it was.
[2785.33s -> 2795.31s]  TF2, play TF2.
[2795.31s -> 2797.31s]  I'm not playing TF2.
[2797.31s -> 2801.02s]  Why would I play TF2 right now?
[2801.02s -> 2803.02s]  It's not fucking gonna happen.
[2803.02s -> 2824.97s]  Uh, I think we'll, um, I think we'll probably have to call it today here, I think.
[2824.97s -> 2832.65s]  I think we'll, uh, drink more.
[2832.65s -> 2836.14s]  Somebody's been that person.
[2836.14s -> 2855.92s]  You didn't go off camera.
[2855.92s -> 2858.35s]  Shut the fuck up.
[2858.35s -> 2860.35s]  You fucking idiot.
[2860.35s -> 2862.35s]  Shut the fuck up.
[2862.35s -> 2869.97s]  Go to sleep.
[2869.97s -> 2872.66s]  I don't, I don't have to go to sleep.
[2872.66s -> 2873.66s]  I don't have to go to sleep.
[2873.66s -> 2875.66s]  I'm an adult.
[2875.66s -> 2880.14s]  I'm an adult.
[2880.14s -> 2891.46s]  Okay, I'm getting off the camera.
[2891.46s -> 2904.86s]  But seriously though, um, I, I can't get this off.
[2904.86s -> 2915.83s]  I'm just making it worse.
[2915.83s -> 2920.71s]  I'm just getting, hold on, let me fix my like disgusting hair.
[2920.71s -> 2922.71s]  I'm just getting like red face.
[2922.71s -> 2924.71s]  You know, it's like spreading.
[2924.71s -> 2925.71s]  I need toothpaste.
[2925.71s -> 2926.71s]  I need a special tissue.
[2926.71s -> 2928.71s]  I, Kim has this stuff.
[2928.71s -> 2938.80s]  I've just, I'm just gonna be wine mouthed.
[2938.80s -> 2939.80s]  All right, let's go.
[2939.80s -> 2941.80s]  Let's play Nancy Drew.
[2941.80s -> 2947.86s]  Uh, this, what?
[2947.86s -> 2955.65s]  Dude, this, the stream has been going for an hour.
[2955.65s -> 2961.73s]  Holy shit.
[2961.73s -> 2962.73s]  Wow.
[2962.73s -> 2965.48s]  All right, Nancy Drew, let's go.
[2965.48s -> 2973.43s]  Seriously though, on my next pee break, I'm gonna have to put like vinegar all over my mouth.
[2973.43s -> 2975.50s]  I don't know what to do.
[2975.50s -> 2977.50s]  All right, let's explore the town.
[2977.50s -> 2987.04s]  Uh, meat?
[2987.04s -> 2988.04s]  Is this meat?
[2988.04s -> 2992.24s]  Chaos at Skip Brock commerce meeting.
[2992.24s -> 2997.62s]  What's the, what the fuck was that?
[2997.62s -> 2998.62s]  What's the lipstick brand?
[2998.62s -> 3001.62s]  I don't know.
[3001.62s -> 3002.92s]  Kim's.
[3002.92s -> 3004.92s]  Kim's lipstick.
[3004.92s -> 3009.10s]  The color, um, big red.
[3009.10s -> 3010.10s]  I don't know.
[3010.10s -> 3011.10s]  It's Kim's.
[3011.10s -> 3012.10s]  Okay.
[3012.10s -> 3016.36s]  Town hall meeting this week erupted into discord when a local fisherman caused a scene of what
[3016.36s -> 3019.36s]  he calls a threat to score Icelandic values.
[3019.36s -> 3024.36s]  Skip Brock citizen Gunnar Tonneson brought a written petition to the meeting, hoping to
[3025.36s -> 3029.36s]  interrupt the board's vote on fiscal allocation for the annual ancestors festival.
[3029.36s -> 3031.36s]  A lot of reading.
[3031.36s -> 3034.62s]  Ooh, it's a hook.
[3034.62s -> 3035.62s]  A meat hook.
[3035.62s -> 3043.30s]  A discord town hall meeting.
[3043.30s -> 3046.63s]  All right, I got a meat hook.
[3046.63s -> 3052.56s]  This is a measty skip.
[3052.56s -> 3054.99s]  The measty skip.
[3054.99s -> 3058.77s]  Measty skip.
[3058.77s -> 3062.48s]  Sleep near.
[3062.48s -> 3078.38s]  That's Star Wars.
[3078.38s -> 3080.77s]  Okay.
[3080.77s -> 3081.77s]  I was wondering what the hell that was.
[3081.77s -> 3086.91s]  All right.
[3086.91s -> 3087.91s]  Is this a menu?
[3087.91s -> 3088.91s]  This is a dining room.
[3088.91s -> 3089.91s]  Good day.
[3089.91s -> 3090.91s]  Good day.
[3090.91s -> 3091.91s]  Hi there.
[3091.91s -> 3092.91s]  I'm investigating a recent disappearance.
[3092.91s -> 3093.91s]  My name's Nancy Drew.
[3093.91s -> 3094.91s]  Speak up, girl.
[3094.91s -> 3095.91s]  My name's Nancy Drew.
[3095.91s -> 3096.91s]  Louder.
[3096.91s -> 3097.91s]  I said my name's Nancy Drew.
[3097.91s -> 3098.91s]  Mind your ship flag and temper.
[3098.91s -> 3099.91s]  Looks like we have a real angry one here.
[3099.91s -> 3100.91s]  Uh.
[3100.91s -> 3101.91s]  Name's Gunnar.
[3101.91s -> 3102.91s]  What you can call me, Gunnar.
[3102.91s -> 3103.91s]  Gunnar.
[3103.91s -> 3104.91s]  The skip is my home.
[3104.91s -> 3105.91s]  Oh.
[3105.91s -> 3106.91s]  What?
[3107.91s -> 3108.91s]  Louder.
[3108.91s -> 3109.91s]  Louder.
[3109.91s -> 3110.91s]  Are you a sailor?
[3110.91s -> 3111.91s]  Are you a sailor?
[3111.91s -> 3112.91s]  Was.
[3112.91s -> 3113.91s]  Long ago.
[3113.91s -> 3114.91s]  I gave up the sea for good.
[3114.91s -> 3115.91s]  And I'll never sail again.
[3115.91s -> 3116.91s]  You still look like a sailor to me.
[3116.91s -> 3117.91s]  Whoa.
[3117.91s -> 3118.91s]  What does a sailor look like?
[3118.91s -> 3119.91s]  It's a certain quality.
[3119.91s -> 3120.91s]  I can't quite place it.
[3120.91s -> 3121.91s]  Worn?
[3121.91s -> 3122.91s]  Broken?
[3122.91s -> 3123.91s]  Bitter?
[3123.91s -> 3124.91s]  I don't know.
[3124.91s -> 3125.91s]  I don't know.
[3125.91s -> 3126.91s]  I don't know.
[3126.91s -> 3127.91s]  I don't know.
[3127.91s -> 3128.91s]  I don't know.
[3128.91s -> 3129.91s]  I don't know.
[3129.91s -> 3130.91s]  I don't know.
[3130.91s -> 3131.91s]  I don't know.
[3131.91s -> 3132.91s]  I don't know.
[3132.91s -> 3133.91s]  I don't know.
[3133.91s -> 3134.91s]  I don't know.
[3134.91s -> 3135.91s]  Broken?
[3135.91s -> 3136.91s]  Bitter?
[3136.91s -> 3141.91s]  The sea chewed me up and spat me back out, and I lost everything in her waves.
[3141.91s -> 3143.91s]  If you can do a convincing Scottish accent...
[3143.91s -> 3147.91s]  I bet you'd not last one minute against some of the gays I've sailed.
[3147.91s -> 3149.91s]  You will always have voice work.
[3149.91s -> 3151.91s]  I'm so surprisingly hard to kill.
[3151.91s -> 3155.91s]  Well, we'll see about that, detective, won't we?
[3155.91s -> 3161.24s]  Someone's always looking for the Scottish accent.
[3161.24s -> 3163.24s]  No matter what, it doesn't matter.
[3163.24s -> 3169.47s]  What are you talking about?
[3169.47s -> 3170.47s]  What are you talking about?
[3170.47s -> 3171.47s]  This is not Scottish.
[3171.47s -> 3172.47s]  What is this?
[3172.47s -> 3173.47s]  What is it?
[3173.47s -> 3180.13s]  It's not Icelandic?
[3180.13s -> 3185.12s]  Did you know, Magnus?
[3185.12s -> 3186.12s]  What?
[3186.12s -> 3187.12s]  Sure did.
[3187.12s -> 3188.12s]  Never liked him.
[3188.12s -> 3192.45s]  Did something happen between you two?
[3192.45s -> 3194.45s]  No, I don't like anyone.
[3194.45s -> 3196.45s]  I don't think I like you.
[3196.45s -> 3198.45s]  I'm still going it over.
[3198.45s -> 3199.45s]  Norwegian chat.
[3199.45s -> 3201.45s]  Icelandic is nothing like this.
[3201.45s -> 3202.45s]  Thank you!
[3203.45s -> 3209.33s]  So you were wrong, too.
[3209.33s -> 3211.33s]  I was wrong and you were wrong.
[3211.33s -> 3213.33s]  We both get to be equally wrong.
[3213.33s -> 3214.33s]  It's good.
[3214.33s -> 3216.33s]  What about your fingers?
[3216.33s -> 3218.33s]  So, about your fingers...
[3218.33s -> 3219.33s]  My lucky three?
[3219.33s -> 3221.33s]  Is that what you call them?
[3221.33s -> 3222.33s]  Sure is.
[3222.33s -> 3223.33s]  It's a long story.
[3223.33s -> 3225.33s]  Now, there I was.
[3225.33s -> 3231.33s]  Out in the peach black of night, with no sign of shore and only my fishing spear.
[3232.33s -> 3234.33s]  Then suddenly, I saw a shadow.
[3234.33s -> 3237.33s]  It was a mighty squid, the greatest hunter of them all.
[3237.33s -> 3238.33s]  That's a lie.
[3238.33s -> 3241.33s]  Few men have had to sit and tell the tale.
[3241.33s -> 3244.33s]  So I pulled out my spear just a little too fast, mind you.
[3244.33s -> 3247.33s]  And that's how you lost your fingers?
[3247.33s -> 3250.59s]  Of course not!
[3250.59s -> 3254.59s]  I drew the spear right overboard and I hauled that fellow into my net.
[3254.59s -> 3257.59s]  Took all my weight, used to keep him from wriggling free.
[3257.59s -> 3260.59s]  But his strength proved too much for me.
[3260.59s -> 3264.59s]  He gnashed his giant beak and, well, I was done for.
[3264.59s -> 3266.59s]  So the squid took your fingers?
[3266.59s -> 3267.59s]  No, no, no, no!
[3267.59s -> 3273.59s]  Right as I thought I was dead, a massive shark leapt out of the waves and ate the squid.
[3273.59s -> 3274.59s]  It was the sleeper shark.
[3274.59s -> 3278.59s]  It stalled six meters long with four rows of teeth.
[3278.59s -> 3282.59s]  He bit my arm and pulled me under as I gasped for my last breath.
[3282.59s -> 3284.59s]  So it was a shark then?
[3284.59s -> 3285.59s]  No!
[3285.59s -> 3288.59s]  I managed to punch him in the nose!
[3288.59s -> 3290.59s]  Did you ever fight a shark?
[3290.59s -> 3292.59s]  You know how to punch him in the nose?
[3292.59s -> 3296.59s]  He let me go, I swam like a merman and made it back to shore.
[3296.59s -> 3299.59s]  Three months later, I was in a wood shop accident.
[3299.59s -> 3301.59s]  Right, that's what it is then.
[3301.59s -> 3303.59s]  That's what I knew it would be.
[3303.59s -> 3306.59s]  At least it makes for a great story.
[3306.59s -> 3309.79s]  Yeah, I mean that's...
[3309.79s -> 3313.95s]  That's a...
[3313.95s -> 3316.83s]  Have you met Dagny?
[3316.83s -> 3317.83s]  Who?
[3317.83s -> 3319.83s]  This guy is based.
[3319.83s -> 3321.83s]  The Republic High's restoration.
[3321.83s -> 3323.83s]  Brown hair about Yehai?
[3323.83s -> 3327.83s]  Ah, a tough little mink of a woman.
[3327.83s -> 3328.83s]  Not bad in my book.
[3328.83s -> 3331.83s]  Did you see her the day of the ship crash?
[3331.83s -> 3336.20s]  Yeah, she was there, but I paid no attention to the mink.
[3336.20s -> 3338.38s]  Okay, um...
[3338.38s -> 3340.38s]  I heard you had problems with the festival the last couple of years.
[3340.38s -> 3344.38s]  I heard you've had problems with the festival the last couple of years.
[3344.38s -> 3346.38s]  Care to talk about that?
[3346.38s -> 3349.38s]  The festival is not what it once was.
[3349.38s -> 3354.38s]  I turn things to the old ways no matter how many buckets of hot tar I have to dump.
[3354.38s -> 3356.38s]  Why are you dumping hot tar?
[3356.38s -> 3358.38s]  Some of the harbor boats still have holes in their bottoms.
[3358.38s -> 3362.38s]  I see. Did you have a plan like that for this year too?
[3362.38s -> 3366.38s]  Elisabeth said no more trouble or she kicks me out of the skip.

[3949.97s -> 3950.97s]  I know these words now.
[3950.97s -> 3952.97s]  These have a pop up ever again.
[3952.97s -> 3956.68s]  You're addicted to Icelandic.
[3956.68s -> 3958.98s]  No, I'm addicted to making $5,000.
[3958.98s -> 3960.98s]  So I never have to make money again.
[3960.98s -> 3963.98s]  So I just walk around with a huge purse full of money.
[3963.98s -> 3967.14s]  Okay.

[3979.38s -> 3985.93s]  A friend is, teacher is, I fucked it up.
[3985.93s -> 3986.93s]  Don't matter.
[3986.93s -> 3987.93s]  Father.

[3998.33s -> 3999.33s]  All right.
[3999.33s -> 4000.33s]  I got exactly 2,000.
[4000.33s -> 4001.33s]  That's why I messed those ones up.
[4001.33s -> 4002.33s]  I'm done.
[4002.33s -> 4004.53s]  All right.

[4096.22s -> 4097.22s]  This is so neat.
[4097.22s -> 4099.22s]  I wish I could play these.
[4099.22s -> 4101.97s]  You can just do it.

[4381.97s -> 4386.10s]  I feel like this is my live stream.
[4386.10s -> 4389.10s]  When you know you haven't spoken, you haven't said anything in about like 30 seconds.
[4389.10s -> 4392.10s]  So you're like, fuck, I have to say something.
[4392.10s -> 4393.10s]  Hmm.
[4393.10s -> 4396.25s]  Hmm.
[4396.25s -> 4397.25s]  I got nothing.
[4397.25s -> 4398.25s]  I have nothing to say right now.
[4398.25s -> 4400.25s]  And like, there are people that are watching this stream.
[4400.25s -> 4401.25s]  Uh.
[4401.25s -> 4403.45s]  Okay.
[4403.45s -> 4404.45s]  That works.
[4404.45s -> 4407.61s]  Good.
[4407.61s -> 4408.61s]  He's inactive.
[4408.61s -> 4409.61s]  All right.
[4409.61s -> 4410.61s]  I need to go to the inn.
[4410.61s -> 4413.81s]  Can I, is it like a, can I go to sleep?
[4413.81s -> 4420.30s]  Culture center?
[4420.30s -> 4422.75s]  This person's scary.
[4422.75s -> 4424.99s]  I don't know what it is about.
[4424.99s -> 4431.62s]  It's the fact that they're the two different styles of, you're like lit improperly.
[4431.62s -> 4435.33s]  Like you're a hologram.
[4435.33s -> 4438.33s]  This just looks, just seems, this is freaking me out.
[4438.33s -> 4455.95s]  Oh, simulate your fear.
[4455.95s -> 4461.76s]  You got me.
[4461.76s -> 4463.32s]  You got me.
[4463.32s -> 4466.16s]  All right.
[4466.16s -> 4467.16s]  Well, that's cool.
[4467.16s -> 4469.16s]  Learn to speak like a sailor aboard a tall ship.
[4469.16s -> 4470.16s]  Touch to begin.
[4470.16s -> 4472.16s]  You need to match each sail to its name.
[4472.16s -> 4473.16s]  What?
[4473.16s -> 4476.06s]  Is this Iceland?
[4476.06s -> 4477.06s]  Is this Icelandic?
[4477.06s -> 4482.02s]  Jib.
[4482.02s -> 4483.02s]  I don't know.
[4483.02s -> 4484.02s]  I don't know.
[4484.02s -> 4486.15s]  Okay.
[4486.15s -> 4487.39s]  This is, what do I?
[4487.39s -> 4488.39s]  Boat.
[4488.39s -> 4490.27s]  The main top mast stay sail.
[4490.27s -> 4492.11s]  The missing top galant sail.
[4492.11s -> 4493.11s]  Okay.
[4493.11s -> 4494.99s]  This is, what's a jib?
[4494.99s -> 4499.94s]  I have no idea what any of this stuff is.
[4499.94s -> 4501.58s]  There's this much shit on a boat.
[4501.58s -> 4507.96s]  I thought it was a big bed sheet, like two big bed sheets on two large poles.
[4507.96s -> 4508.96s]  I don't know.
[4508.96s -> 4512.70s]  There was this many segments.
[4512.70s -> 4513.70s]  I don't even know.
[4513.70s -> 4515.77s]  What's a jib?
[4515.77s -> 4525.98s]  The, uh, the four top sail, main top sail.
[4525.98s -> 4530.10s]  You need to find the treasures learning about the ship.
[4530.10s -> 4532.74s]  Where's the jib?
[4532.74s -> 4533.74s]  All right.
[4533.74s -> 4534.74s]  Um, I don't care.
[4534.74s -> 4535.74s]  Parts of a ship sail.
[4535.74s -> 4536.74s]  Oh, here we go.
[4536.74s -> 4538.37s]  Here's like a, this will help us.
[4538.37s -> 4542.30s]  All right.
[4542.30s -> 4543.30s]  I got it.
[4543.30s -> 4544.30s]  Cheating.
[4544.30s -> 4549.06s]  Um, how is learning cheating?
[4549.06s -> 4551.90s]  How would I, why would I ever know this information?
[4551.90s -> 4553.52s]  You want me to walk down the path and find what all these are named?
[4553.52s -> 4554.52s]  This is just learning.
[4554.52s -> 4555.52s]  This is learning what these are and then clicking on them.
[4555.52s -> 4557.34s]  Uh, where's the flying?
[4557.34s -> 4558.34s]  There's the flying.
[4558.34s -> 4559.34s]  There's the flying.
[4559.34s -> 4561.22s]  There's the flying.
[4561.22s -> 4562.22s]  There's the flying.
[4562.22s -> 4563.22s]  There's the flying.
[4563.22s -> 4564.22s]  There's the flying.
[4564.22s -> 4565.22s]  There's the flying.
[4565.82s -> 4568.58s]  This is learning what these are and then clicking on them.
[4568.58s -> 4574.88s]  Uh, where's the flying?
[4574.88s -> 4575.88s]  There's the flying jib.
[4575.88s -> 4579.49s]  It's not even on here.
[4579.49s -> 4586.42s]  What about the one underneath?
[4586.42s -> 4589.50s]  The four moon sail is this one.
[4589.50s -> 4596.14s]  Do they have different names for everything?
[4596.14s -> 4600.13s]  This is supposed to be the four moon sail.
[4600.13s -> 4607.60s]  Four stay sail.
[4607.60s -> 4610.55s]  This is the wrong sheet.
[4610.55s -> 4614.00s]  This thing's called the spanker.
[4614.00s -> 4617.32s]  Uh, incorrect apparently.
[4617.32s -> 4618.32s]  Parts of a ship.
[4618.36s -> 4625.34s]  What about this one?
[4625.34s -> 4627.30s]  The main mast is the one in the middle.
[4627.30s -> 4629.44s]  Okay.
[4629.44s -> 4647.16s]  So this is main mast, main top sail, uh, main top galant stay sail, main royal sail, main
[4647.16s -> 4648.16s]  sail.
[4648.16s -> 4653.30s]  Okay.
[4653.30s -> 4660.38s]  The four mast is the one, so this is the, there's too many parts here.
[4660.38s -> 4663.06s]  He doesn't know.
[4663.06s -> 4669.94s]  Even with a, I have a cheat sheet right next to me and it's still confusing me.
[4669.94s -> 4671.98s]  Because people call these different things.
[4671.98s -> 4674.88s]  Somebody said this is the beak.
[4674.88s -> 4676.48s]  This is the spanker on one list.
[4676.48s -> 4684.18s]  All right.
[4684.18s -> 4685.18s]  Here we go.
[4685.18s -> 4690.07s]  He looks, this looks like a good one.
[4690.07s -> 4691.07s]  Main mat crows now.
[4691.07s -> 4692.07s]  Okay.
[4692.07s -> 4694.66s]  Shrouds of the officers.
[4694.66s -> 4702.70s]  No, this is like the four top galant sail.
[4702.70s -> 4710.00s]  This is too many sails.
[4710.00s -> 4711.80s]  Why there's too many?
[4711.80s -> 4712.80s]  What is this thing?
[4712.80s -> 4718.94s]  This is, they're just floating.
[4718.94s -> 4724.56s]  Uh, I can't even cheat.
[4724.56s -> 4730.50s]  I can't cheat because these are all these images of like different from each other.
[4730.50s -> 4734.50s]  Every single one of these is different to the next one because some of them only have
[4734.50s -> 4738.10s]  one or two masts.
[4738.10s -> 4739.10s]  I can't cheat.
[4739.10s -> 4740.91s]  Holy fuck.
[4740.91s -> 4741.91s]  Wait a minute.
[4741.91s -> 4748.15s]  Is this actually, is this from the game?
[4748.15s -> 4750.80s]  I think this is from the game.
[4750.80s -> 4762.01s]  I just typed in like parts of a ship.
[4762.01s -> 4766.26s]  I'm going to type in force for sale for sale.
[4766.26s -> 4770.71s]  Um, I, do you think I'm going to sit there and look at all that shit?
[4770.71s -> 4774.58s]  They're all so different.
[4774.58s -> 4779.37s]  For Royal, the eggplant sale?
[4779.37s -> 4780.37s]  What?
[4780.37s -> 4781.37s]  I'm putting this on screen.
[4781.37s -> 4797.86s]  This thing, seafaring, captains and shit have different names for everything.
[4797.86s -> 4798.86s]  Let's go over this.
[4798.86s -> 4799.86s]  Help me.
[4799.86s -> 4822.92s]  What, what, what, what, what am I looking at here?
[4822.92s -> 4823.92s]  Okay.
[4823.92s -> 4831.26s]  So see that that's the four moon sail.
[4831.26s -> 4838.70s]  The mizzen is the back mizzen moon sail.
[4838.70s -> 4843.11s]  There's the stay sale.
[4843.11s -> 4846.47s]  He's don't even mizzen top sale.
[4846.47s -> 4847.47s]  There's only two.
[4847.47s -> 4869.06s]  No, I can't even read this mizzen.
[4869.06s -> 4870.06s]  Click my link.
[4870.06s -> 4875.65s]  What the fuck is that?
[4875.65s -> 4879.50s]  That's a lot of, but mizzen Royal's not even on here.
[4879.50s -> 4880.50s]  Mizzen sky sale.
[4880.50s -> 4886.48s]  All right.
[4886.48s -> 4888.92s]  The ones that mizzen are in the back.
[4888.92s -> 4889.92s]  Okay.
[4889.92s -> 4890.92s]  Okay.
[4890.92s -> 4891.92s]  Mizzen top sale.
[4891.92s -> 4892.92s]  I don't know this one.
[4892.92s -> 4893.92s]  Mizzen stay sale.
[4893.92s -> 4895.74s]  This one.
[4895.74s -> 4902.08s]  Top glance sale.
[4902.08s -> 4907.28s]  Use this one.
[4907.28s -> 4908.28s]  I'm trying to click it.
[4908.28s -> 4909.28s]  It's going too fast.
[4909.28s -> 4913.85s]  That's not, that's not even what this is.
[4913.85s -> 4914.85s]  Game boomers.
[4914.85s -> 4915.85s]  What is game boomers?
[4915.85s -> 4916.85s]  All right.
[4916.85s -> 4922.46s]  Did you just give me the actual solution?
[4922.46s -> 4923.46s]  Is this the solution?
[4923.46s -> 4947.71s]  A, E, K, B, A, E, K, I had K, correct, K, B, H, O, F, N, D, J.
[4948.71s -> 4964.14s]  Uh, M, C, I, M, C, I, well, hold on.
[4964.14s -> 4967.54s]  I'm not spelling out something fucked up, right?
[4967.54s -> 4968.54s]  Okay.
[4968.54s -> 4969.54s]  I'm not.
[4969.54s -> 4972.10s]  I just, somebody just linked me like an, like an imgur link of, or I don't, I don't know
[4972.10s -> 4975.22s]  why I just figured maybe they would like making me spell something fucking crazy.
[4975.22s -> 4976.22s]  Okay.
[4976.22s -> 4986.49s]  And the last two are L, G. Learn to speak like a sailor.
[4987.49s -> 4996.44s]  Rear or towards the stern, front or towards the bow, port, parts of the average ship's
[4996.44s -> 5002.60s]  bow spirit to David, forecastle gaff.
[5002.60s -> 5006.68s]  Didn't like a boat crash into a wall and aren't we, is it, wasn't it like a murder
[5006.68s -> 5007.68s]  or something?
[5007.68s -> 5013.59s]  Why do we have to do this?
[5013.59s -> 5014.59s]  That's all this was for.
[5014.59s -> 5018.78s]  That's it.
[5018.78s -> 5023.09s]  Maybe later.
[5023.09s -> 5026.47s]  Complimentary gift wrap available.
[5026.47s -> 5027.47s]  Gift wrap on gasoline.
[5027.47s -> 5028.47s]  All right.
[5028.47s -> 5029.47s]  Let's talk.
[5029.47s -> 5030.47s]  Hi there.
[5030.47s -> 5031.47s]  My name is Soren.
[5031.47s -> 5032.71s]  You must be Nancy.
[5032.71s -> 5035.55s]  I'm Soren, the organizer of the Ancestors Festival.
[5035.55s -> 5038.03s]  I run the culture center here in Skiprock.
[5038.03s -> 5039.03s]  Nice to meet you.
[5039.03s -> 5040.03s]  Can you help me get onto the ship?
[5040.03s -> 5041.03s]  Ah, you're in the laundry room?
[5041.03s -> 5042.03s]  Is Elizabeth not manning the gangway?
[5042.03s -> 5043.03s]  The gangway is missing, unfortunately.
[5043.03s -> 5044.03s]  Oh dear.
[5044.03s -> 5045.03s]  Well, that's highly unusual.
[5045.03s -> 5046.03s]  I'll take care of it straight away for you.
[5046.03s -> 5047.03s]  No accent?
[5047.03s -> 5048.03s]  Rose, truly.
[5048.03s -> 5049.03s]  But she does have thorns.
[5049.03s -> 5050.03s]  Hey, what do you think happened to Magnus?
[5050.03s -> 5051.03s]  What do you think happened to Magnus?
[5051.03s -> 5064.13s]  I admit I haven't the faintest idea.
[5064.13s -> 5068.93s]  That man's mind is a hive of mysteries, an enigma, an impenetrable den.
[5068.93s -> 5070.93s]  So you two never really talked?
[5070.93s -> 5071.93s]  This dude's sweater.
[5071.93s -> 5072.93s]  An understatement.
[5072.93s -> 5073.93s]  I want a nice hot coffee right now.
[5073.93s -> 5076.93s]  The man hardly spoke 10 words to me the entire time I knew him.
[5076.93s -> 5077.93s]  I do hope he's all right.
[5077.93s -> 5078.93s]  I don't know why.
[5078.93s -> 5079.93s]  It's getting an automatic response from me.
[5080.65s -> 5083.65s]  I want like a nice hot latte.
[5083.65s -> 5084.65s]  I don't...
[5084.65s -> 5085.65s]  I just want it.
[5085.65s -> 5086.65s]  I'm already disliked.
[5086.65s -> 5090.27s]  And it would only show the others how easy it is to make someone disappear.
[5090.27s -> 5092.27s]  What is this place?
[5092.27s -> 5094.35s]  This is my battle station.
[5094.35s -> 5098.83s]  The place where I endeavor to fight my way through the thickest mysteries of Icelandic
[5098.83s -> 5099.83s]  history.
[5099.83s -> 5104.95s]  Here, confusing ancient shipwrecks and obscure writings from millennia past are converted
[5104.95s -> 5105.95s]  into knowledge and truths.
[5105.95s -> 5106.95s]  This is my battle station.
[5106.95s -> 5107.95s]  Also, I have swords.
[5108.35s -> 5111.35s]  Take a look at how many monitors I have over here.
[5111.35s -> 5116.95s]  So, you're a historian, archaeologist, a bit of both?
[5116.95s -> 5117.95s]  I dabble.
[5117.95s -> 5122.07s]  I spent some years at Harvard pursuing my doctorate in Viking history before returning
[5122.07s -> 5123.71s]  to Skipporad for research.
[5123.71s -> 5126.55s]  I'm one of the only few to ever travel in this town.
[5126.55s -> 5128.11s]  Everyone here should try it sometime.
[5128.11s -> 5130.43s]  Really shakes up the old bag of prejudices.
[5130.43s -> 5132.55s]  I guess that explains why you don't have much of an accent.
[5132.55s -> 5134.95s]  Check out my washing machine collection.
[5137.02s -> 5139.82s]  You know, there's people that collect everything.
[5139.82s -> 5145.56s]  If you don't think that somebody has a basement full of washing machines and dryers, there
[5145.56s -> 5146.56s]  definitely is.
[5146.56s -> 5151.00s]  In fact, if there's somebody that collects it, that means that there's probably a convention
[5151.00s -> 5152.81s]  for that too.
[5152.81s -> 5154.51s]  I guarantee it.
[5154.51s -> 5160.15s]  If you typed in vintage washing machine convention, you'll find something.
[5160.15s -> 5166.17s]  Alright, what are you researching?
[5173.17s -> 5175.17s]  Wash-con.
[5187.17s -> 5189.17s]  Did you do it?
[5197.17s -> 5199.17s]  Oh, you lost me.
[5199.17s -> 5201.17s]  You lost me real quick.
[5202.17s -> 5203.17s]  Cool.
[5203.17s -> 5204.17s]  Cool swords.
[5204.17s -> 5205.17s]  Bye.
[5205.17s -> 5210.67s]  What do you think about this sword?
[5210.67s -> 5212.67s]  I could use a little space, Nancy.
[5212.67s -> 5216.22s]  Alright.
[5216.22s -> 5223.82s]  Uh, nothing over here.
[5223.82s -> 5225.82s]  Wait, what's this?
[5225.82s -> 5229.40s]  Uh, the sextant.
[5229.40s -> 5234.40s]  Navigational instrument which allowed sailors to determine latitude, the astrolabe, the
[5234.40s -> 5237.40s]  sunstone, the fishing reel, the cargo lantern.
[5237.40s -> 5238.40s]  There's a lot about boats.
[5238.40s -> 5240.40s]  There's a lot of things about boats here.
[5240.40s -> 5242.98s]  Do I have a...
[5242.98s -> 5246.82s]  Oh, my cell phone!
[5246.82s -> 5248.96s]  Settings.
[5252.42s -> 5254.85s]  Why would you want this as your background?
[5254.85s -> 5256.85s]  Is it bear traps and meat hook and shit?
[5256.85s -> 5258.85s]  That's kind of creepy.
[5261.02s -> 5263.02s]  Oh, I like the crystals.
[5263.02s -> 5264.02s]  Ringtone.
[5266.26s -> 5271.98s]  What?
[5278.90s -> 5279.90s]  What's comedy?
[5280.90s -> 5285.00s]  That's a comedy.
[5285.00s -> 5287.00s]  I don't know.
[5287.00s -> 5289.56s]  That's pretty funny.
[5293.68s -> 5295.68s]  Alright, I'm going to do the Yoshi sound.
[5298.14s -> 5299.14s]  Ringtone.
[5299.14s -> 5305.79s]  Oh, that one's real.
[5305.79s -> 5308.93s]  Why is it called Oregon?
[5308.93s -> 5316.35s]  Should I do the burps?
[5316.35s -> 5319.94s]  Alright, that's pretty good.
[5320.94s -> 5322.94s]  Definitely the scratch one, okay.
[5322.94s -> 5324.82s]  What about my photos?
[5324.82s -> 5327.18s]  View galleries.
[5327.18s -> 5330.96s]  No photos?
[5330.96s -> 5335.48s]  Okay, what about, um, my diary?
[5335.48s -> 5337.48s]  I'm not writing it down.
[5337.48s -> 5338.48s]  Phone.
[5338.48s -> 5340.48s]  Oh, it's Ned!
[5340.48s -> 5342.48s]  I can call Ned with this.
[5351.21s -> 5353.21s]  One, because this number doesn't exist.
[5353.21s -> 5355.21s]  For everyone else, leave a message.
[5362.14s -> 5364.77s]  I just really pissed that person off.
[5364.77s -> 5366.71s]  Because they just got...
[5366.71s -> 5367.71s]  Yo, you have a new voicemail!
[5367.71s -> 5371.30s]  Oh, let me listen.
[5371.30s -> 5372.30s]  I wonder what it is.
[5372.30s -> 5374.30s]  Why is it only four and a half seconds long?
[5374.30s -> 5375.98s]  Oh, it's just this.
[5375.98s -> 5377.98s]  It's like swishing pants.
[5377.98s -> 5378.98s]  And the hang up noise.
[5378.98s -> 5379.98s]  Okay, cool.
[5379.98s -> 5390.66s]  Alright, get this down.
[5391.66s -> 5393.66s]  The game wanted me to go to sleep.
[5393.66s -> 5395.66s]  What was this?
[5395.66s -> 5396.66s]  One, two, three?
[5396.66s -> 5400.80s]  Could you finish setting up the knots display?
[5400.80s -> 5404.80s]  You just need to match the images to the knot they create.
[5404.80s -> 5407.80s]  I do it myself, but I don't have the time.
[5407.80s -> 5408.80s]  I don't...
[5408.80s -> 5410.80s]  I have no idea what you're asking me to do.
[5410.80s -> 5414.80s]  Put the knots next to the knots that they create?
[5414.80s -> 5422.84s]  Put the knots next to the knots they make?
[5422.84s -> 5427.37s]  Uh, this is...
[5427.37s -> 5428.37s]  Is that...
[5428.37s -> 5430.37s]  Is this correct, right?
[5430.37s -> 5434.95s]  Wait, there's five steps for each knot.
[5434.95s -> 5439.30s]  Oh my god.
[5439.30s -> 5441.30s]  I don't know how to do these.
[5441.30s -> 5444.93s]  I don't know any of this stuff.
[5444.93s -> 5450.43s]  I don't know how to do this.
[5450.43s -> 5452.43s]  It's not this one.
[5452.43s -> 5460.46s]  So we got, okay, one big loop.
[5460.46s -> 5461.46s]  And then...
[5461.46s -> 5464.91s]  I mean, that's like, this is done.
[5464.91s -> 5466.09s]  No, it's not.
[5466.09s -> 5469.76s]  What?
[5469.76s -> 5470.76s]  I gotta get...
[5470.76s -> 5474.82s]  I gotta spread them out a little.
[5474.82s -> 5478.34s]  Go get string and do it.
[5478.34s -> 5479.34s]  Am I dumb?
[5479.34s -> 5480.34s]  No, I...
[5480.34s -> 5483.37s]  Alright.
[5483.37s -> 5484.37s]  Chat.
[5484.37s -> 5485.37s]  Chat.
[5485.37s -> 5486.37s]  Excuse me.
[5486.37s -> 5494.13s]  When was the last time any of you made this knot?
[5494.13s -> 5496.13s]  If you ever made that knot.
[5496.13s -> 5497.69s]  Ever.
[5497.69s -> 5499.69s]  And I'm talking for any reason.
[5499.69s -> 5502.38s]  Nobody has made these knots.
[5502.38s -> 5504.38s]  Maybe one of you have done this.
[5504.38s -> 5512.10s]  I can't believe you just know how to make a...
[5512.10s -> 5514.10s]  I can't even give you a fake name
[5514.10s -> 5516.10s]  because I don't even know what these could be called.
[5516.10s -> 5517.10s]  The pretzel knot.
[5517.10s -> 5518.10s]  I don't know.
[5518.10s -> 5521.58s]  This isn't even a knot.
[5521.58s -> 5524.58s]  This is just what happens to my fucking earpods.
[5524.58s -> 5525.58s]  That's your...
[5525.58s -> 5526.58s]  That's a headphone.
[5526.58s -> 5529.14s]  That's a headphone every day.
[5529.14s -> 5530.14s]  Is that done?
[5530.14s -> 5539.06s]  Did I do it?
[5539.06s -> 5542.98s]  No, this one goes up here.
[5542.98s -> 5544.98s]  I think this one goes down here.
[5544.98s -> 5547.86s]  I gotta get them all out so I can look at them.
[5547.86s -> 5551.28s]  Are there any baits?
[5551.28s -> 5553.28s]  Okay, there are no baits.
[5553.28s -> 5560.15s]  Alright, we need to get the two big ones.
[5560.15s -> 5561.15s]  There you go.
[5561.15s -> 5563.22s]  Okay.
[5563.22s -> 5564.22s]  Looking good.
[5564.22s -> 5570.24s]  Alright, looking good.
[5570.24s -> 5578.71s]  This one's done.
[5578.71s -> 5582.74s]  We're gonna need a game boomer here.
[5582.74s -> 5586.62s]  Now, this one, this is the fat loop.
[5586.62s -> 5589.12s]  So this requires a big loop.
[5589.12s -> 5591.12s]  This one has a small loop.
[5591.12s -> 5593.12s]  This one can come down here.
[5593.12s -> 5594.12s]  I think we're gonna be good here.
[5594.12s -> 5596.12s]  I need to have the finishing product.
[5596.12s -> 5599.12s]  This is the finished product of this one.
[5599.12s -> 5605.56s]  This looks like a pretty...
[5605.56s -> 5606.56s]  Um...
[5606.56s -> 5609.70s]  Literally no.
[5609.70s -> 5613.02s]  I kinda wanna make one of these.
[5613.02s -> 5616.25s]  Yo.
[5616.25s -> 5617.25s]  Fuck it.
[5617.25s -> 5618.25s]  I'll be right back.
[5618.25s -> 5730.66s]  Alright, let's give it a try.
[5730.66s -> 5732.96s]  See if I can do this.
[5732.96s -> 5737.91s]  So, we've got...
[5737.91s -> 5742.20s]  Let me see if I can do the middle one.
[5742.20s -> 5745.85s]  Yeah, I don't know if these are shoelaces
[5745.85s -> 5749.85s]  or if these are strings that go inside of hoodies or pants.
[5749.85s -> 5751.98s]  I found them.
[5751.98s -> 5755.57s]  Alright, let's get the cam on.
[5755.57s -> 5771.23s]  Is this drawstring?
[5771.23s -> 5773.23s]  Yeah, I think it is just drawstrings.
[5773.23s -> 5776.37s]  It's just pants.
[5776.37s -> 5782.00s]  Why does this keep happening?
[5782.00s -> 5788.72s]  I keep having it so shrunken.
[5788.72s -> 5791.60s]  No, it's gotta be this way.
[5791.60s -> 5794.42s]  There's the Xbox.
[5794.42s -> 5798.41s]  There we go.
[5798.41s -> 5799.41s]  Okay, right there.
[5799.41s -> 5804.27s]  See if I can do it.
[5804.27s -> 5811.85s]  So, we're looking...
[5811.85s -> 5812.85s]  So, we got...
[5812.85s -> 5814.85s]  Here's our string.
[5814.85s -> 5817.09s]  You need two strings, right?
[5817.09s -> 5826.75s]  So, you take the two ends like this.
[5826.75s -> 5837.89s]  How far up does this need to be?
[5837.89s -> 5847.78s]  Just needs to go wrap around like how many times?
[5847.78s -> 5851.90s]  Twice?
[5851.90s -> 5852.90s]  So, like...
[5852.90s -> 5854.21s]  Hold on a minute.
[5854.21s -> 5855.21s]  This is...
[5855.21s -> 5860.33s]  You go over and...
[5860.33s -> 5861.33s]  Hold on.
[5861.33s -> 5863.33s]  Am I supposed to be doing it like this?
[5863.33s -> 5867.26s]  Over?
[5867.26s -> 5873.59s]  Like that again?
[5873.59s -> 5877.62s]  Okay, like that.
[5877.62s -> 5882.92s]  Then, you...
[5882.92s -> 5892.16s]  These are too...
[5892.16s -> 5894.16s]  Look at how long these are!
[5894.16s -> 5896.16s]  These are so long!
[5896.16s -> 5912.44s]  I need like three people to do this.
[5912.44s -> 5919.16s]  Over, under, like that.
[5919.16s -> 5921.16s]  Okay, that part's done.
[5921.16s -> 5923.16s]  And then we go like this.
[5923.16s -> 5926.16s]  I need like a person to hold on to this shit.
[5926.16s -> 5928.55s]  Like this.
[5928.55s -> 5936.30s]  And then, from here, I go...
[5936.30s -> 5938.56s]  What the fuck do you want me to do here?
[5938.56s -> 5939.56s]  Again?
[5939.56s -> 5941.56s]  Over, under, again?
[5941.56s -> 5943.63s]  Like that?
[5943.63s -> 5945.83s]  Oh, dude!
[5945.83s -> 5946.83s]  Pogchamp!
[5946.83s -> 5947.83s]  I got it.
[5947.83s -> 5954.09s]  What the fuck, dude?
[5954.09s -> 5955.09s]  Are you serious?
[5955.09s -> 5964.01s]  How am I gonna do...
[5964.01s -> 5965.01s]  Oh, God.
[5965.01s -> 5967.01s]  I'm not gonna be able to do these next ones.
[5967.01s -> 5968.63s]  This next one is just...
[5968.63s -> 5969.63s]  Okay.
[5969.63s -> 5970.63s]  Now, I don't need the second one.
[5970.63s -> 5971.63s]  What does this say?
[5971.63s -> 5972.63s]  Do what?
[5972.63s -> 5974.90s]  Do...
[5974.90s -> 5975.90s]  Do...
[5975.90s -> 5976.90s]  Do laundry.
[5976.90s -> 5978.58s]  Okay, I gotta remember that.
[5978.58s -> 5979.58s]  All right, these...
[5979.58s -> 5983.26s]  I gotta fix these ones.
[5983.26s -> 5985.26s]  I didn't want to do it afterwards.
[5985.26s -> 5986.26s]  Okay.
[5986.26s -> 5989.03s]  All right, so...
[5989.03s -> 5990.03s]  I...
[5990.03s -> 5991.03s]  How does this one even work?
[5991.03s -> 5995.73s]  How does this one even work?
[5995.73s -> 5996.73s]  Is there something wrong?
[5996.73s -> 5997.73s]  I don't know.
[5997.73s -> 6003.98s]  Around, and then through that loop, so that's correct.
[6003.98s -> 6011.41s]  And then, once you get to up here, you go around, underneath, and then through, and
[6011.41s -> 6012.41s]  then that's it.
[6012.41s -> 6013.71s]  Is that right?
[6013.71s -> 6018.28s]  No.
[6018.28s -> 6019.28s]  This is...
[6019.28s -> 6020.28s]  This is for the one up there.
[6020.28s -> 6022.28s]  This is for the one up.
[6022.28s -> 6028.18s]  That starts there, and then it goes up, around, and then...
[6028.18s -> 6029.18s]  Let me do it.
[6029.18s -> 6030.18s]  Let me do it.
[6030.18s -> 6032.45s]  Let me do it.
[6032.45s -> 6033.45s]  Switch top, left, and bottom left.
[6034.45s -> 6043.47s]  No, that's not correct, because this has to go up through that hoop.
[6043.47s -> 6047.02s]  Uh...
[6047.02s -> 6052.41s]  From there, you go under, and then you wrap around, and then you...
[6052.41s -> 6055.70s]  Like that?
[6055.70s -> 6056.70s]  Yeah, like that.
[6056.70s -> 6058.00s]  But that's...
[6058.00s -> 6059.00s]  That's the...
[6059.00s -> 6060.00s]  That's this one.
[6060.00s -> 6065.91s]  Got it.
[6065.91s -> 6070.42s]  Okay.
[6070.42s -> 6071.42s]  Now, let's try...
[6071.42s -> 6072.42s]  Let's try that one.
[6072.42s -> 6073.42s]  This actually...
[6073.42s -> 6074.42s]  Kind of fun.
[6074.42s -> 6076.55s]  I like this.
[6076.55s -> 6077.55s]  All right, so then we start.
[6077.55s -> 6079.82s]  Uh, this is too long.
[6079.82s -> 6080.82s]  It's too long.
[6080.82s -> 6081.82s]  I can't do it.
[6081.82s -> 6082.82s]  I can't do it.
[6082.82s -> 6085.02s]  It's too long.
[6088.37s -> 6096.50s]  And then this has to go...
[6096.50s -> 6102.90s]  Make like a circle around and under.
[6102.90s -> 6103.90s]  Like that.
[6103.90s -> 6107.64s]  Right?
[6107.64s -> 6108.64s]  Get...
[6108.64s -> 6111.86s]  Okay.
[6111.86s -> 6116.90s]  It's too long.
[6116.90s -> 6117.90s]  This is way too long.
[6117.90s -> 6120.59s]  And then this one goes...
[6120.59s -> 6121.59s]  Uh...
[6121.59s -> 6125.66s]  Through the hoop here, over.
[6125.66s -> 6126.66s]  Like that.
[6126.66s -> 6131.55s]  And then under, and then over.
[6131.55s -> 6134.55s]  This one needs to be much smaller, but this one's going to be a little bigger.
[6134.55s -> 6136.11s]  Uh...
[6136.11s -> 6137.11s]  Wait.
[6137.11s -> 6142.45s]  Hold on.
[6142.45s -> 6143.45s]  Fuck.
[6143.45s -> 6145.07s]  No, that's okay.
[6145.07s -> 6148.07s]  So then this one goes underneath this one.
[6148.07s -> 6152.40s]  And then it wraps back down through...
[6152.40s -> 6155.83s]  Over there, through here, under.
[6155.83s -> 6156.83s]  And then you pull it.
[6156.83s -> 6167.86s]  Did I get it?
[6167.86s -> 6170.26s]  I got it.
[6170.26s -> 6176.10s]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[6176.10s -> 6182.72s]  Doesn't feel very secure, though.
[6182.72s -> 6183.72s]  Nice.
[6183.72s -> 6196.16s]  I can't...
[6196.16s -> 6197.16s]  There we go.
[6197.16s -> 6198.16s]  There we go.
[6198.16s -> 6199.16s]  All right.
[6199.16s -> 6200.16s]  What's the last one?
[6200.16s -> 6202.16s]  I've got to get it right.
[6202.16s -> 6204.16s]  Last one is...
[6204.16s -> 6205.16s]  Start there.
[6205.16s -> 6208.53s]  I want to just do this.
[6208.53s -> 6211.15s]  I want to just make nuts.
[6211.15s -> 6212.15s]  Is that fucking stupid?
[6212.15s -> 6215.10s]  I wanted to do this.
[6215.10s -> 6217.10s]  Okay, so then wrap it around there.
[6217.10s -> 6218.10s]  Then that...
[6218.10s -> 6219.10s]  Oh, shit.
[6219.10s -> 6220.10s]  No, no, no.
[6220.10s -> 6221.10s]  Don't leave the screen.
[6221.10s -> 6222.10s]  Don't leave the screen.
[6222.10s -> 6223.10s]  Don't leave the screen.
[6223.10s -> 6230.03s]  I want to see that.
[6230.03s -> 6233.06s]  Oh, god damn it.
[6233.06s -> 6234.06s]  I can't see.
[6234.06s -> 6235.06s]  Shit.
[6235.06s -> 6236.06s]  Uh...
[6236.06s -> 6237.06s]  It's all right.
[6237.06s -> 6240.86s]  I can kind of see it.
[6240.86s -> 6241.86s]  Click on it again?
[6241.86s -> 6242.86s]  I can't.
[6242.86s -> 6244.74s]  I can see it.
[6244.74s -> 6246.74s]  You just simply wrap it around like that.
[6246.74s -> 6249.39s]  Like that.
[6249.39s -> 6250.39s]  Okay.
[6250.39s -> 6252.14s]  And then this...
[6252.14s -> 6253.14s]  What does it do?
[6253.14s -> 6262.30s]  It goes under and then over, like, right there, immediately.
[6262.30s -> 6265.06s]  And then I can't see.
[6265.06s -> 6274.90s]  And then I can't see.
[6274.90s -> 6278.16s]  Let me make it bigger so I can see it.
[6278.16s -> 6284.88s]  This is insanely important to me, so I can't click on it anymore.
[6284.88s -> 6294.20s]  So let me do this again.
[6294.20s -> 6295.20s]  Reset.
[6295.20s -> 6299.90s]  It's just...
[6299.90s -> 6300.90s]  This one has to be longer.
[6300.90s -> 6302.33s]  So like that.
[6302.33s -> 6305.82s]  And then it wraps back around.
[6305.82s -> 6318.92s]  So under, under, and then over, immediately right here, like that.
[6318.92s -> 6333.46s]  And then you go back under and through the loop, like this, and then out across to here.
[6333.46s -> 6342.50s]  And then that shit goes all the way around and then under itself.
[6342.50s -> 6343.50s]  Like that.
[6343.50s -> 6345.45s]  And then tighten it.
[6345.45s -> 6349.44s]  Did I do it?
[6349.44s -> 6358.36s]  Did I get it?
[6358.36s -> 6362.80s]  Okay.
[6362.80s -> 6368.71s]  No, I got it.
[6368.71s -> 6369.71s]  That was correct.
[6369.71s -> 6373.51s]  Nice.
[6373.51s -> 6375.14s]  Somebody give me, give me, give me another knot to do.
[6375.14s -> 6376.14s]  I want to do another knot.
[6376.14s -> 6378.34s]  Anybody have one more I can do?
[6378.34s -> 6379.34s]  You're a serial killer.
[6379.34s -> 6380.34s]  What?
[6380.34s -> 6385.48s]  Fun knots to do.
[6385.48s -> 6390.11s]  Ooh, essential knots.
[6390.11s -> 6391.11s]  How to tie 20 knots.
[6391.11s -> 6392.11s]  Why is doing knots a serial killer?
[6392.11s -> 6393.48s]  Okay, cool.
[6393.48s -> 6394.72s]  We did the square knot.
[6394.72s -> 6395.72s]  Okay, what about the bow?
[6395.72s -> 6398.75s]  We did the bow line.
[6398.75s -> 6421.45s]  The figure 8, the street, the sheet bend, two half hitches, taut hitch line, fisherman's
[6421.45s -> 6422.45s]  knot.
[6422.45s -> 6423.45s]  Look at this one.
[6423.45s -> 6424.94s]  Let me try this one just by hand.
[6424.94s -> 6425.94s]  Check this one out.
[6425.94s -> 6431.98s]  This one's fucked up.
[6431.98s -> 6432.98s]  Look at how crazy this one is.
[6432.98s -> 6440.01s]  See if I can do it.
[6440.01s -> 6442.01s]  Let's not be in the gem watch.
[6442.01s -> 6449.14s]  Look at this thing.
[6449.14s -> 6451.66s]  Cool.
[6451.66s -> 6459.55s]  Let me try it.
[6459.55s -> 6460.55s]  Okay, let's get some music here.
[6460.55s -> 6470.62s]  Let's try it.
[6470.62s -> 6476.22s]  So it looks like it's a small circle here.
[6476.22s -> 6477.71s]  Cool.
[6477.71s -> 6478.71s]  Like that.
[6478.71s -> 6479.71s]  And then it goes underneath itself like this.
[6479.71s -> 6480.71s]  Actually underneath like three or four times.
[6480.71s -> 6482.38s]  Make it a little bit bigger though.
[6482.38s -> 6483.38s]  Ow, ow.
[6483.38s -> 6484.38s]  Um.
[6484.38s -> 6486.07s]  Um.
[6486.07s -> 6487.38s]  Okay.
[6487.38s -> 6488.38s]  This is breaking my finger.
[6488.38s -> 6489.38s]  It's breaking my finger.
[6489.38s -> 6500.09s]  Oh, I hate this.
[6500.09s -> 6501.09s]  I hate this.
[6501.09s -> 6503.35s]  I hate this.

[6558.38s -> 6563.20s]  I hate this.
[6563.20s -> 6564.20s]  I hate this.
[6564.20s -> 6565.20s]  I hate this.
[6565.20s -> 6567.46s]  I hate this.
[6567.46s -> 6568.46s]  I hate this.
[6568.46s -> 6569.46s]  I hate this.
[6569.46s -> 6570.46s]  Hold on.
[6570.46s -> 6571.46s]  Hold on.
[6571.46s -> 6572.46s]  Hold on.
[6572.46s -> 6573.64s]  Hold on.
[6573.64s -> 6575.90s]  I gotta.
[6575.90s -> 6576.90s]  How do you escape?
[6576.90s -> 6577.90s]  How to escape a knot.
[6577.90s -> 6582.96s]  How to escape from?
[6582.96s -> 6589.32s]  Please.
[6589.32s -> 6590.32s]  How do I get out of this?
[6590.32s -> 6596.04s]  How do I get out of this?
[6596.04s -> 6597.04s]  How do I get out of this?

[6632.89s -> 6635.72s]  That when I breathe oh
[6635.72s -> 6647.17s]  Oh, I just had to let go with my right hand. I was holding it. That was weird. Okay, that'll heal
[6647.17s -> 6650.09s]  I think okay, that'll heal nicely in the next six months
[6650.77s -> 6677.49s]  Okay. Um, that's good. What's that sound? Oh, it's this
[6679.01s -> 6681.66s]  Sound

[6720.29s -> 6724.17s]  $2,000 too. Oh shit. This stuff is still on screen. I'm sorry
[6724.81s -> 6729.29s]  Alright, let's get some slippers
[6729.85s -> 6739.77s]  2,700 bucks some money first. That's too much. This stuff is also expensive. I just fucking I just bought it
[6739.77s -> 6742.05s]  I just bought it. I don't have any money left. I bought one
[6742.57s -> 6751.94s]  Looks like you're out of cash. I'll need to earn some money first
[6752.58s -> 6758.38s]  You'll need more money for that. Damn it. I hope I need that item soon
[6759.00s -> 6763.82s]  Back to the learn Icelandic game
[6764.42s -> 6771.87s]  No, I have to go to bed. I hasn't even one evening in this game
[6781.54s -> 6785.58s]  All right, where do I where do I go to sleep you again
[6786.06s -> 6792.13s]  What do you think of Gunnar in terms of the treasure?
[6792.45s -> 6796.89s]  He tried to sabotage the festival last year and any though before that are you certain?
[6796.89s -> 6799.19s]  I wouldn't be surprised if this is a stunt of his
[6800.21s -> 6802.50s]  Bye. Bye
[6802.50s -> 6804.10s]  See you drew
[6804.14s -> 6806.11s]  Where's the bed?
[6806.11s -> 6814.58s]  Explore the town search the ship explore the misty skip. I can't explore the thing because I can't get up there. Wait a minute
[6815.14s -> 6816.90s]  This wasn't here before
[6816.90s -> 6823.76s]  Who let you on board if you're here for the festival? It's canceled. I didn't mean to intrude
[6823.76s -> 6829.64s]  I just like to have a look around if that's okay. My name is Nancy Drew. I'm a visitor. I
[6830.32s -> 6832.32s]  Know you're a tourist
[6832.56s -> 6833.56s]  Oh
[6833.56s -> 6835.76s]  Storm and boat a tourist. I'm here to investigate
[6836.52s -> 6840.84s]  Thanks for setting up that gangway for me, by the way, the gangway was meant for sorry
[6840.84s -> 6845.52s]  I didn't know he planned to let strangers on board. Are you with that snake of a woman?
[6846.12s -> 6848.30s]  Hey
[6848.34s -> 6855.02s]  Yes, Dagny, yes, I'm working with her if you're after just the gold I want nothing to do with you leave
[6856.26s -> 6860.62s]  Wait, I'm not after any treasure. I just want to help find Magnus
[6861.62s -> 6863.50s]  Magnus
[6863.50s -> 6869.34s]  Look, I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot. Maybe I should start over. My name's Nancy
[6869.66s -> 6876.46s]  It's really nice different voice actress. I'm Elizabeth. I run the misty skip club in town. What do you want with Magnus?
[6876.46s -> 6880.62s]  Oh good. So you know him. Hmm. That's a question
[6881.26s -> 6888.35s]  Is it I thought I knew him maybe I was wrong. He's a pretty mysterious guy sounds like quite the mysterious guy
[6888.59s -> 6892.95s]  It doesn't matter I want nothing to do with him now or you
[6893.79s -> 6897.89s]  It's in the bag
[6897.89s -> 6899.89s]  Ma'am, can I take a look at that bag, please?
[6900.25s -> 6906.42s]  Hey, Elizabeth, may I borrow a snowmobile key?
[6907.14s -> 6909.14s]  Depends are you going to steal it?
[6909.46s -> 6914.42s]  Not this time. I think I'd have trouble fitting it into my carry-on luggage. It is a different person
[6914.42s -> 6918.08s]  Here's the key. We have tourists take them every year. I'm watching you
[6919.06s -> 6925.28s]  Always use the provided seat belt snow looks soft until you land headfirst
[6925.76s -> 6927.76s]  She stole it last time
[6927.96s -> 6930.96s]  What do you think happened to Magnus? The current rumor is that he fell overboard
[6930.96s -> 6936.48s]  Do you think happened to Magnus the current rumor is that he fell overboard? Do I think he is drowned?
[6936.48s -> 6938.48s]  Is that what you're asking?
[6938.88s -> 6945.78s]  He might have I didn't mean that I didn't mean it that way. I certainly hope so
[6946.42s -> 6950.22s]  Some people think he ran off with some old treasure. It may be a coincidence
[6951.14s -> 6954.54s]  It may not Danny doesn't think it was a coincidence at all
[6955.18s -> 6957.18s]  So I do like
[6957.74s -> 6963.82s]  Just a bit here and there even I've really really want to go shop at Old Navy now
[6964.06s -> 6966.86s]  Because everyone that we've seen so far was in an Old Navy
[6968.34s -> 6970.86s]  Too lofty to concern himself with human affairs
[6971.86s -> 6979.10s]  Do not go to Old Navy
[6979.66s -> 6987.29s]  Old Navy gaming what did Gunnar do anything unusual leading up to the festival?
[6987.45s -> 6992.73s]  Well, if you include the two festivals before this one, they look like mannequins he ruined them single-handedly
[6993.21s -> 6996.85s]  Aside from that only the usual threat. Oh, thank you. Oh, Navy game
[6997.37s -> 6999.37s]  And sent him out to sea
[7000.93s -> 7002.93s]  Bye bye
[7006.53s -> 7013.65s]  We really got it getting we got to get in that that twitch culture, you know, I mean we got to get in there
[7014.29s -> 7019.35s]  What are you doing using your key? Hey, what are you doing? Oh, that doesn't fit
[7020.07s -> 7032.60s]  Crows nest. Let's go up
[7032.64s -> 7036.14s]  Jesus
[7036.14s -> 7038.98s]  86
[7038.98s -> 7065.21s]  80 what does 86 mean? Is that I don't know. This is a currency thing
[7065.73s -> 7070.45s]  Is this some kind of currency thing? All right, let's get down. How do I get down?
[7070.89s -> 7073.78s]  I'd be careful up here though. At any moment I could like I
[7075.10s -> 7083.07s]  Think I'm I could I could slip. Oh, oh shit up. Oh, I
[7083.87s -> 7106.58s]  Lost the game capture
[7109.57s -> 7112.53s]  80s it was some kind of currency thing 86 is that a currency? Oh
[7113.81s -> 7119.59s]  Wow, the Aurora boiling house. Thank you right now, right? It's absolutely beautiful
[7120.59s -> 7140.90s]  Something like that. Why did you do that? Why do you sound like me? What?
[7143.21s -> 7148.16s]  Why do you sound like me? All right, let's take this
[7170.03s -> 7177.06s]  Pretty good song
[7177.18s -> 7182.83s]  Captain's log
[7182.83s -> 7187.44s]  Thank you. Hank cheesecake for the five community sets are really appreciate that
[7190.34s -> 7192.97s]  Here it is one more time for you
[7193.53s -> 7201.37s]  Masts from tallest to shortest. We already did this. We just cheated for this one. That's fine
[7201.89s -> 7211.76s]  My pretend to steer the boat. All right, Nancy put it down. Wow, I can
[7212.34s -> 7230.96s]  Can I honk the horn? I don't think I can honk the horn. I let me um, let me go to the snowmobile
[7231.60s -> 7235.57s]  What is this?
[7235.77s -> 7246.38s]  What we need a gas for Oh the book for the snowmobile
[7250.25s -> 7267.21s]  That makes sense. I kind of want to take a look back here though. Can I know just leave just leave leave
[7268.01s -> 7271.36s]  What looks like this day is in good shape?
[7279.70s -> 7295.78s]  All right to the snowmobile let's go hello. Hello. Oh, that's my ring tone
[7296.66s -> 7302.35s]  No, I'm already getting closer all the time. I thought that was my swishy
[7302.95s -> 7304.79s]  outdoor winter pants
[7304.79s -> 7308.26s]  It's hard to get people to talk though
[7309.38s -> 7317.40s]  Yes, I've managed to narrow down that the treasure is related to the ship somehow, but beyond that I haven't figured out the specifics
[7322.41s -> 7325.67s]  Of course, then will you take any other photos of yourself
[7328.57s -> 7330.57s]  Sunday it's our anniversary
[7332.05s -> 7346.14s]  We had reservations for dinner remember Ned dot dot dot
[7347.54s -> 7352.08s]  So am I under the impression that
[7352.86s -> 7356.46s]  She forgot about their anniversary when they had a reservation planned
[7356.78s -> 7368.71s]  But instead she got on a plane to Iceland or is he here too? And why does
[7369.19s -> 7371.11s]  What does he not know this?
[7371.11s -> 7379.56s]  Sorry, Ned. I forgot about our anniversary. It's not like I'm in traffic on the way home. Oh, that's right. Shit our anniversary
[7379.64s -> 7384.64s]  I'm coming right home. No, I mean Ned. I'm in Iceland and I'll see you in two weeks
[7384.80s -> 7391.28s]  I'm so so so sorry. I completely forgot
[7400.66s -> 7409.55s]  This case is really important
[7419.35s -> 7431.90s]  Do you like gasoline? All right gasoline. All right, let's go
[7434.14s -> 7436.14s]  Yeah, no shit
[7442.93s -> 7444.93s]  Let's go
[7447.06s -> 7451.67s]  I'm on the
[7452.11s -> 7468.77s]  Why is there a magic cave not a big fan of exploring caves in the dark. I'll need a light source
[7469.77s -> 7471.29s]  Use your phone
[7471.29s -> 7482.54s]  You kidding me. I'm not a big fan of it. I came all the way out here for no reason. I'll need a light source
[7483.26s -> 7493.46s]  Here do I think this is um, I don't know
[7494.48s -> 7496.48s]  somewhere post 2010
[7497.00s -> 7500.61s]  That this isn't supposed to be like the early 2000
[7512.16s -> 7517.26s]  Drive to Ned's house
[7517.26s -> 7520.86s]  This takes place in like 2014 or something
[7521.46s -> 7524.02s]  All right. I need a flashlight. I mean, what is this sketch piece?
[7524.62s -> 7532.30s]  The number 86 was carved into the mast
[7533.30s -> 7536.94s]  learning about the ship
[7537.94s -> 7544.66s]  He could have gone left there. I thought somebody was just making a joke because like the cave on the left thing
[7544.66s -> 7548.28s]  I actually do have a name, you know, it's Nancy
[7548.66s -> 7550.66s]  This is the 30-second Nancy Drew game
[7550.66s -> 7554.66s]  Get your little lady bones into the prep area and get some Torremotor orders ready
[7554.66s -> 7558.66s]  It's all hands-on back for the lunch rush. Wait, cooking segment?
[7559.06s -> 7564.50s]  I'm a sleuth not a chef. Are you sure you want me back there handling the sharp stuff?
[7564.86s -> 7569.38s]  You're eating a lot in here for free. Why does every Nancy Drew game have cooking food in it?
[7569.38s -> 7574.06s]  So it's only fair to get some good work out of you. Well might as well take a stab at it
[7578.01s -> 7581.84s]  Oh my god, this is not cooking
[7582.52s -> 7587.94s]  Fill the Torremotor tray according to the order where they eat penguins
[7588.58s -> 7590.88s]  they eat penguins and
[7591.04s -> 7597.84s]  All requests must be filled though. Some compartments may be empty orders can be filled in one of two ways across a row
[7598.52s -> 7602.68s]  And in a Z shape within a color tiny group
[7603.36s -> 7607.64s]  When checking whether an order is complete empty spaces don't count. I don't know what this is telling me
[7608.20s -> 7612.55s]  All requests must be filled though some can some compartments can be empty
[7613.15s -> 7620.13s]  They can do they can go in a Z shape
[7620.57s -> 7624.22s]  When checking whether an order is complete empty spaces don't count
[7624.94s -> 7633.41s]  Remember that each row and each color tray group counts as one order and must contain no extra items
[7633.41s -> 7638.53s]  The row below has an extra Lundy so it doesn't meet the order requirements when all orders are filled
[7638.53s -> 7641.45s]  You receive any remaining tips choose to make a new order
[7641.97s -> 7649.28s]  What I mean, that's not a penguin is it like molded up ice cream to look like a penguin I don't understand
[7649.28s -> 7650.44s]  What are you talking about?
[7650.44s -> 7655.91s]  fill them

[7692.12s -> 7699.11s]  Alright new water get it out ship it out of here. Did I do it faster? Oh
[7703.38s -> 7706.22s]  I know and I can't do it faster than that. It's just too confusing
[7707.02s -> 7709.02s]  Just doing Z's only Z's. I don't care
[7717.34s -> 7718.86s]  And then then
[7718.86s -> 7727.18s]  And then sheep and then sheep down here and then fish and then that no, no, no fucked it up. What's happening?

[7784.90s -> 7797.51s]  No, get in there. What are you? I have no idea what he's doing. Neither do I have no idea what's going on
[7797.51s -> 7801.85s]  I thought I was gonna be flipping pancakes
[7806.38s -> 7809.02s]  Why would you put me back here, I don't know what any
[7809.66s -> 7818.50s]  That one looked really easy wait, hold on wait, wait, wait, wait, wait shit. Wait, wait. Okay. This one. No, this one looks easy
[7819.18s -> 7843.44s]  shit
[7843.44s -> 7869.20s]  How do I fix this? I need two and then one I'm confused
[7870.52s -> 7873.78s]  it can be in a Z or
[7874.38s -> 7879.18s]  Cross or a cross has to be I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it

[7943.01s -> 7948.21s]  You motherfucker. Why does it I'm trying to pick this one up?
[7948.21s -> 7950.21s]  Why is it giving me like a ton of them?
[7950.53s -> 7995.80s]  It's the same fucking thing. All right, if I flip these I would love to flip these so we got to do
[7996.58s -> 8007.74s]  Sheep on left. What do you mean on left put a bad review on Yelp?

[8073.60s -> 8076.20s]  Friendship that's friendship to you. What are you on about?
[8077.60s -> 8079.60s]  It still seems a little strange
[8080.52s -> 8082.52s]  spoken by a woman with no friends
[8083.04s -> 8089.05s]  Hey, I have friends and I have boyfriend who I am ditching to be here talking to you

[8173.20s -> 8179.44s]  Gold ever since that sword took over the festival running. It's been straight to the bottom with it
[8180.44s -> 8186.61s]  Did Magnus ever say anything about a treasure chest that you may have found
[8187.25s -> 8195.56s]  Did Magnus ever say anything about the treasure a lazy purple? Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody

[8285.24s -> 8287.24s]  needing to know what
[8287.76s -> 8296.43s]  Masts and sails on boats are is not a puzzle. That's information. I want a puzzle not info

[8375.53s -> 8377.53s]  What's the what are you talking about?
[8378.05s -> 8382.05s]  So we're gonna do this middle management style. That is what I'm where am I and I?
[8382.61s -> 8387.65s]  Supervise each of those circuit pieces will attach anywhere on this mine sweeper special numbers
[8387.65s -> 8392.17s]  You've got to watch out for covered numbers add together to give that piece a total value
[8392.17s -> 8397.21s]  If you can use all five pieces to hit all five target values the heater will be fixed
[8397.85s -> 8406.25s]  You know, I made this like that's how electricity works. Oh, yeah. Okay. Where'd you get your PhD in electricity again?
[8407.33s -> 8409.33s]  Are you sure I don't have to?

[8641.39s -> 8647.24s]  It's disgusting to me. That's somebody said that I could do the battery
[8647.64s -> 8665.62s]  Wait, turn around. Can I go in any of these rooms go on this one? Alright, this is the captain's room
[8666.14s -> 8671.86s]  Each row column contains exactly two of each toy
[8673.95s -> 8679.47s]  No, not one of these both puffins are to the right of both dogs. No adjacent toys of the same kind
[8679.95s -> 8682.11s]  No ponies in the left half of the cupboard
[8682.99s -> 8687.55s]  Both dogs are somewhere to the left of both puffins. The puffins are between the ponies. The dogs are adjacent
[8688.27s -> 8696.51s]  Who was that a locator?
[8696.51s -> 8698.51s]  Here's your puzzle. This is not a puzzle
[8699.15s -> 8702.67s]  Wow an antique desk and it's in pristine condition
[8703.95s -> 8709.52s]  Time to break it open. I need to figure out the rules being used in each row here
[8711.65s -> 8715.17s]  Fill in the three squares to complete the sequence using each of the rows
[8730.67s -> 8732.11s]  one two
[8732.11s -> 8734.11s]  Let's I don't know three
[8734.51s -> 8738.43s]  Three two one three two plus three is five. I don't know three and
[8739.95s -> 8741.23s]  one and then
[8741.23s -> 8743.23s]  Uh, two two is four
[8743.23s -> 8751.98s]  Yeah, they they add
[8752.30s -> 8758.51s]  What about this? Does the color mean anything?
[8760.77s -> 8762.77s]  One to the two to the two to the three
[8766.11s -> 8777.87s]  That's just one two three
[8777.87s -> 8780.83s]  No, it's two to the one to the one to the three
[8781.71s -> 8789.02s]  What is somebody going to what does that sound is somebody in the bathroom?
[8789.58s -> 8797.57s]  That was weird
[8797.57s -> 8799.65s]  What's the solution? I don't care
[8799.65s -> 8801.65s]  This is not even puzzles
[8802.13s -> 8804.53s]  These are all right. I'm gonna say it and I don't like even
[8805.25s -> 8807.25s]  I don't know. I don't like saying this
[8807.33s -> 8809.33s]  I don't like saying this. I don't i'm gonna say it though
[8809.65s -> 8811.52s]  I'm gonna say this is
[8811.52s -> 8814.88s]  This is like this is boomer puzzle because this is like the shit that they do in a newspaper
[8815.20s -> 8816.80s]  This is a newspaper puzzle
[8816.80s -> 8821.36s]  This is not find who the murderer is or unravel the mystery. This is open up
[8822.32s -> 8824.32s]  page 16 of a newspaper
[8824.64s -> 8827.10s]  There's a this is
[8827.10s -> 8832.66s]  Come on, you should be good at it. Then read the newspaper
[8833.90s -> 8836.46s]  I don't like the way that it feels it. I don't like how it feels my hands
[8836.46s -> 8840.86s]  It's like weird and like sandy and crusty and it may it dry. I don't like it. I hate it
[8841.58s -> 8850.29s]  When I okay, those of you that don't get it next time you have a newspaper
[8851.01s -> 8852.96s]  on your person
[8852.96s -> 8857.44s]  Just like open it and like take and grab and like slide your fingers up and down it and touch it
[8858.08s -> 8864.56s]  Grab it. It's dry and gross and fucking I hate the way it feels. I fucking hate it. I hate it so much
[8865.28s -> 8870.88s]  Thinking about holding and turning and sliding and grabbing a newspaper makes me want to do. Ah, it's the worst
[8871.52s -> 8876.53s]  It's like nails on a chalkboard. Um, uh, just give me the solution. What is it?
[8879.95s -> 8883.95s]  All rows add up for five six seven eight nine all rows add up to nine. Thanks for that. Appreciate it
[8884.27s -> 8887.79s]  Five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven
[8888.59s -> 8889.87s]  eight nine
[8889.87s -> 8892.75s]  Uh, what two four five six seven eight nine?
[8893.71s -> 8895.71s]  so it actually was two to the three to the
[8897.31s -> 8899.31s]  six seven eight nine
[8899.63s -> 8901.63s]  Yeah, it was two to the three to the one
[8903.30s -> 8905.30s]  six seven eight nine
[8905.62s -> 8910.18s]  Three four five six seven eight nine five six seven eight nine. Wait one
[8913.28s -> 8915.28s]  Five six seven eight nine
[8916.77s -> 8922.29s]  One two, three six seven eight nine six seven eight nine. What do you that's not working?
[8923.17s -> 8938.91s]  Does this row meet? Hold on. Wait six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty fourteen
[8939.55s -> 8941.33s]  three
[8941.33s -> 8942.77s]  colors at the top
[8942.77s -> 8946.80s]  And what the hell does that matter does it have to be three in each row?
[8948.67s -> 8950.67s]  So five six seven eight nine
[8952.80s -> 8955.28s]  Two four five six seven eight nine
[8955.84s -> 8966.02s]  It has to be four red and three yellow. Okay, so that's one that's six seven eight nine

[10463.23s -> 10468.36s]  Okay, I got I got the egg. What does that do? Yeah that that that deserves quite a few
[10469.16s -> 10470.28s]  of the
[10470.28s -> 10475.64s]  That thing that people say when something crazy happens and scary and I don't know what the fuck
[10477.53s -> 10479.21s]  Dude
[10479.21s -> 10481.71s]  I'm concerned about it
[10482.11s -> 10486.17s]  bed
[10486.17s -> 10488.65s]  Put egg in bed hatch egg on bed
[10489.29s -> 10494.03s]  What this what's this here for?
[10494.03s -> 10501.71s]  Pro bar
[10501.71s -> 10503.71s]  More clues haven't done that
[10504.43s -> 10506.43s]  What else is in here? Oh a suitcase
[10507.92s -> 10510.48s]  Can you pet dog in nancy drew?
[10511.84s -> 10513.84s]  Shadow on the ocean. Yes
[10514.32s -> 10536.56s]  They look who is this still to find clues for this shit. I better find some pins first. Wait
[10537.69s -> 10541.12s]  This is um
[10541.12s -> 10542.64s]  Isn't this it?
[10542.64s -> 10543.68s]  No
[10543.68s -> 10550.59s]  Hold up a piece of paper pins
[10551.23s -> 10559.00s]  What do I get pins?
[10559.00s -> 10561.00s]  Those cities are one-letter names
[10567.21s -> 10569.21s]  Yeah, I can't wait to go to gee
[10569.61s -> 10573.61s]  I wonder if that's why she called me instead of going to the police about magnus
[10574.41s -> 10579.53s]  Have you been running your mouth hope you realize it's going to take a lot of dough to make this disappear
[10580.01s -> 10583.47s]  Iceland government reports big treasure to be found
[10591.50s -> 10592.86s]  All right, where the pins?
[10592.86s -> 10611.69s]  I'm apparently still not done in this office. I guess not
[10612.33s -> 10629.93s]  Let's go talk shit. She's not here anymore. I got a lot of stuff
[10630.65s -> 10634.11s]  Jeremy, can you pass the cereal box? No
[10635.68s -> 10637.68s]  You guys remember when I was gonna do the stream?
[10638.24s -> 10639.20s]  where
[10639.28s -> 10644.96s]  I bought a shitload of cereal boxes and we did all the activities on just put the camera on
[10649.82s -> 10652.06s]  And then I had I realized
[10653.52s -> 10654.96s]  that you
[10654.96s -> 10656.48s]  That would be so
[10656.48s -> 10661.10s]  horrible
[10661.10s -> 10663.10s]  Because what I would what I actually would end up doing
[10664.38s -> 10665.90s]  I would have
[10665.90s -> 10668.54s]  20 30 plus cereal boxes in this room
[10670.35s -> 10672.00s]  and I would
[10672.00s -> 10676.56s]  Be drawn on them and shit and then i'm thinking what am I going to do with this much cereal?
[10677.85s -> 10679.93s]  Uh
[10679.93s -> 10684.17s]  And I could I could only donate it to like a food like a food pantry
[10685.13s -> 10688.41s]  Then that's makes sense. But then all the boxes would be wicked fucked up
[10688.97s -> 10691.92s]  And that's like maybe I could take the bags out
[10692.48s -> 10696.40s]  Right, like take the bags out and just keep the boxes and then recycle the boxes
[10697.56s -> 10699.56s]  And then donate the bags
[10699.88s -> 10702.03s]  Would that make sense?
[10702.03s -> 10705.93s]  Does it put labels on the bags?
[10706.09s -> 10711.82s]  Do you think they would care if you did the puzzles on the box?
[10713.87s -> 10715.87s]  Well, no, but I mean, I I don't know
[10716.67s -> 10718.99s]  It's am I I don't know. It might be like messy
[10719.87s -> 10721.47s]  what if I like
[10721.47s -> 10726.51s]  Mess up and I get angry and I like oh god, I like stabbed the box a bunch of times
[10726.59s -> 10728.99s]  He's fucking bad. I didn't think everyone laughs
[10729.71s -> 10737.84s]  You know what i'm saying?
[10737.84s -> 10740.08s]  I I need batteries for my flashlight
[10742.36s -> 10746.60s]  Wait, let's go check on a couple things here. Let's go talk to you. I got some shit to tell you
[10748.08s -> 10750.08s]  Uh, I need to know some things
[10750.16s -> 10758.56s]  Who was present at the time of the festival raging at a cereal box? Who else did you see only gunner elizabeth and soren were thoroughly mia
[10758.88s -> 10763.68s]  Although half of iceland is probably related to itself. So people kind of look alike could have missed something
[10764.72s -> 10773.85s]  How'd you meet magnus? I heard about the rumor of the treasure through my connections then I approached him
[10774.49s -> 10778.09s]  He's a hard guy to pin down that blind up all the cereal and glue it to your hair
[10779.37s -> 10782.65s]  I just happened to come in at an opportune moment
[10783.98s -> 10789.02s]  Magnus do with a treasure. Why would I do that desperately wants to buy his own ship true? Not true
[10789.82s -> 10791.98s]  That makes no sense. Ship guys are like that
[10792.94s -> 10797.98s]  So the ship he helped rebuild isn't his we funded it, but it's town property
[10800.67s -> 10803.55s]  Uh, how long were you working on that ship project?
[10804.83s -> 10810.11s]  About two years on and off of it magnus supervised the rebuilds. I provided the cash
[10810.75s -> 10815.39s]  That's a long time to hang around in iceland. Have you been in skip rot all that time?
[10816.67s -> 10820.03s]  No, I think the locals would have offed me by now if that were the case
[10820.27s -> 10823.63s]  I don't like to stay in one place for too long. She's not quite 30 fps
[10823.79s -> 10830.43s]  If you stay in one place people start to need you and feel things about you and all that icky weird stuff
[10830.83s -> 10836.03s]  I'm not really the having friends type. I'd like to think you and I are on friendly terms
[10836.51s -> 10842.59s]  What is this are we gonna hold hands and sing campfire songs now, I don't want to do it but find my gold
[10843.31s -> 10845.31s]  Later, I want to do it
[10845.55s -> 10847.39s]  I wonder like every
[10847.39s -> 10852.43s]  I can't say this because if people want me to do it and they're just gonna annoy the fuck out of like half the people here
[10853.31s -> 10856.11s]  They really will people will be as if it was just leave and shit
[10857.31s -> 10859.31s]  Like whatever
[10860.67s -> 10865.95s]  I want to just like play like we can loud party music and put an echo in my voice every five minutes and like be like
[10866.11s -> 10868.11s]  Where's the drew crew?
[10868.51s -> 10871.56s]  Just to make sure you guys are still watching but of course you are
[10876.14s -> 10880.14s]  Like where's the drew crew at the club like we're at the club. I don't know
[10883.64s -> 10886.20s]  Do you have any batteries in here? Hi
[10890.59s -> 10893.95s]  Do you have anything which might help with my investigation?
[10894.99s -> 10900.03s]  If i'm not in town, i'm always locked up in here. I do have some very nice pamphlets though
[10900.35s -> 10905.71s]  The pamphlet lovers journal rated them a nine star out of ten. I put them together myself
[10906.51s -> 10908.51s]  Here's one for your troubles
[10909.31s -> 10914.19s]  Give me it's hard to turn down an award-winning pamphlet. I'll see if I can make use of this
[10914.99s -> 10916.35s]  Oh, okay
[10916.35s -> 10922.91s]  Ding dingies. Hey sailors. Did you know every year in iceland roughly 0.8 out of every 100,000 citizens die of drowning?
[10925.45s -> 10929.61s]  How does 80% of you drown? What one per I don't get that
[10930.57s -> 10932.57s]  or approximately 2.6
[10932.57s -> 10935.37s]  Wait, what?
[10935.37s -> 10939.13s]  Because modern science has not made it possible to save six-tenths of a person from drowning
[10939.85s -> 10943.69s]  Caution while out on the seas can be the most important factor in saving a life. It's an average
[10944.57s -> 10948.03s]  Oh
[10948.03s -> 10951.71s]  Know your motor proper voltage must be flowing to jump start a broken motor
[10952.35s -> 10955.79s]  As a handy guy remember these standard recommended voltages 16.9
[10957.45s -> 10959.71s]  1913
[10959.71s -> 10960.59s]  Ooh
[10960.59s -> 10965.15s]  Until utila hooks scraping barnacles easy pancake flipping
[10965.77s -> 10967.77s]  threatening political dissenters
[10968.09s -> 10971.45s]  Thanks, soren
[10971.45s -> 10976.82s]  You're kind of a psycho. All right
[10976.98s -> 10981.22s]  Uh, I sent some bad blood between you and gunner blood between you and gunner
[10982.26s -> 10984.66s]  It's more like gunner dumping bad blood onto me
[10985.44s -> 10988.90s]  Repeatedly while laughing. I try to be patient given his
[10989.70s -> 10995.94s]  History, but what a nanderthal that one. I can't reason with a man who only speaks fist
[10997.46s -> 11001.78s]  Between you and me he's never been the same since that terrible crash years ago
[11002.26s -> 11004.26s]  Didn't within the boat just crash
[11004.66s -> 11006.34s]  Don't know that it's my place to speak of it
[11006.42s -> 11012.26s]  But his boat sank to the bottom of the bay and he hasn't sailed since now. He stays locked up in that pub of his
[11015.26s -> 11017.42s]  So you attended the festival, right?
[11018.30s -> 11020.78s]  present and accounted for naturally
[11021.72s -> 11028.38s]  Interesting dagny says you weren't there. Why would she lie about that up in old stulka manning the controls for our audio
[11028.86s -> 11034.70s]  That's the tower right outside this center mind if I take a look very rarely look up I found which is a shame
[11035.26s -> 11037.26s]  Lots of nifty things in that direction
[11039.91s -> 11041.91s]  Mind if I take a look later?
[11042.15s -> 11043.53s]  Bye now
[11043.53s -> 11048.57s]  The bitcoin crash. Hey soren, can I use some of this gift wrap? Yes
[11049.29s -> 11052.97s]  Great now how about a magic egg? That would be fun to get
[11054.33s -> 11055.29s]  Oh
[11055.29s -> 11057.29s]  I guess it's gonna all right. It's the
[11057.29s -> 11059.03s]  That
[11059.03s -> 11061.59s]  Okay, I hope somebody wants this I need batteries
[11066.42s -> 11068.42s]  I'll need to earn some money first
[11068.82s -> 11070.82s]  I'll need to earn some money first
[11071.14s -> 11074.90s]  Do I actually have to go do the language things the only way to make money?
[11076.65s -> 11078.28s]  batteries
[11078.28s -> 11080.04s]  I can afford that
[11080.04s -> 11081.72s]  Get him in the get him in
[11081.72s -> 11084.79s]  All right. I got a flashlight. Let's go to the cave
[11087.94s -> 11090.26s]  Buy the sword. I don't have any money to buy the sword. Not yet
[11099.62s -> 11104.89s]  Sort of riot you don't have to riot. That'd be fine. That's where it gets scary
[11105.61s -> 11115.08s]  It's a glove
[11115.08s -> 11118.04s]  Wonder who it belongs to it belongs to the icebreaker
[11125.38s -> 11128.42s]  The local town in iceland's favorite professional wrestler
[11129.14s -> 11151.48s]  somebody in the ice
[11151.48s -> 11156.79s]  What's in the ice?
[11156.79s -> 11159.75s]  Dean dingus. No, I don't know why okay
[11160.39s -> 11167.32s]  What's in there?
[11167.32s -> 11169.32s]  I'm gonna need to melt this eventually
[11169.56s -> 11180.75s]  There's nothing here. What about this looks suspicious
[11184.47s -> 11191.54s]  These rocks. No, what was the point of even coming in here? I have to go back to the captain's quarters. Apparently I missed something
[11192.98s -> 11199.18s]  I got this toy bullshit the locator
[11200.06s -> 11202.42s]  I did get the radio key. Let me go up there
[11202.90s -> 11206.62s]  This is this is oh, she's back
[11208.06s -> 11210.06s]  Hey, yo, what's up? Can I help?
[11210.38s -> 11211.26s]  Yep
[11211.26s -> 11216.60s]  What's behind the door? So what's behind the mystery door?
[11218.92s -> 11221.16s]  Just an old broom closet. Can I see?
[11222.12s -> 11223.00s]  No
[11223.00s -> 11225.30s]  Not even a hint go away
[11228.79s -> 11230.23s]  Hey nancy
[11230.23s -> 11235.32s]  I spent a lot of time out here. Don't you have somewhere else to be?
[11236.28s -> 11239.32s]  Can you tell me about the festival sound system?
[11239.64s -> 11243.96s]  It's been broken for a week soren told me he was manning the sound system on the morning
[11243.96s -> 11247.64s]  The hierlich hide crashed what but that's not possible
[11248.20s -> 11254.36s]  There was no sound that day sounds like we've got an alibi that doesn't quite match either you're lying or he is
[11254.76s -> 11256.76s]  And i'll find out
[11257.08s -> 11260.76s]  Is there anything more you haven't told me about magnus? No
[11261.56s -> 11263.16s]  Guess you'll have to leave now
[11263.16s -> 11265.00s]  No sound
[11265.70s -> 11269.06s]  You know i'm better than anyone. I don't believe that for an instant
[11269.62s -> 11273.38s]  You know him better than anyone. Wait, what? I don't know him an instant
[11279.16s -> 11283.51s]  Didn't she didn't respond to that
[11283.51s -> 11287.35s]  I need your help elizabeth. I need to know what you know better than anyone
[11289.43s -> 11291.80s]  He is quiet
[11293.67s -> 11295.67s]  Keep me obsessive
[11295.83s -> 11297.59s]  first over his dog
[11297.59s -> 11300.15s]  Then over his writing then over me
[11301.03s -> 11306.71s]  Then over the ship why would someone like him be hiding for gold in the first place he has certain
[11308.39s -> 11312.31s]  He just wants treasure which we go mega lull maniac
[11313.03s -> 11319.19s]  He desperately wants to leave town leave island. I thought he was a captain already. Oh, he is
[11319.75s -> 11321.35s]  but for wealthy people
[11321.35s -> 11327.59s]  Private clients never his own boat never his own destination. He dreams of living like the old captains
[11327.99s -> 11333.35s]  Sailing wherever the wind takes the treasure not real. I see so the treasure would allow him to fulfill that dream
[11333.43s -> 11339.59s]  It's gonna be an old wooden leg and mongus left some guys dentures after we broke up. He called me looking for it
[11340.23s -> 11343.67s]  Secret map it looks like it might be the key to open some kind of box
[11344.31s -> 11348.71s]  But i've never seen any box like that before. I don't know why I kept it for myself
[11349.77s -> 11352.89s]  Maybe I wanted to see whatever it was. He saw it. Yeah, dude
[11356.04s -> 11358.12s]  Lines continue across the gap interesting
[11358.68s -> 11362.76s]  Numbers appear to show the number of touching sections which have been filled
[11363.48s -> 11367.88s]  Must find all five pieces to reveal these two by five. Okay
[11369.00s -> 11373.08s]  Uh intricate moving. Thanks elizabeth. I'm going to get to the bottom of this mess
[11374.04s -> 11376.04s]  We're gonna get to the bottom of this mess
[11376.60s -> 11381.90s]  but first
[11381.90s -> 11387.16s]  Just want to just give a quick little check to see to make sure we have uh
[11389.30s -> 11393.59s]  Those of you that are here with us
[11393.59s -> 11395.59s]  That are part of a very specific crew
[11395.83s -> 11409.94s]  I want you I want you to put oh I give up on that one. I'm not doing that
[11416.06s -> 11418.54s]  That was like a yeah, nah not into it
[11419.90s -> 11422.62s]  Has anyone checked magnus's cabin? No
[11423.34s -> 11424.30s]  I
[11424.30s -> 11428.57s]  Wanted to but you didn't or can't
[11429.29s -> 11432.81s]  Soren wants to do it. I had to get really high energy there and I'd
[11434.33s -> 11436.33s]  Can you help me find a way in?
[11436.65s -> 11438.65s]  No, this town takes care of its own
[11439.53s -> 11441.69s]  Our problems are ours. No one else is
[11445.16s -> 11450.01s]  Goodbye. Bye now. I was dancing. Wow. He's low energy
[11451.69s -> 11453.69s]  I'm getting in this fucking door
[11454.65s -> 11458.41s]  All right, where's the radio?
[11458.41s -> 11460.01s]  up here, right
[11460.01s -> 11468.26s]  All right. Here's the key to the radio
[11475.18s -> 11482.50s]  That's a radio, right? Where's this radio high energy low iq?
[11483.46s -> 11488.55s]  Where's the radio?
[11488.55s -> 11494.94s]  Where's this radio?
[11494.94s -> 11497.82s]  There it is. All right radio key
[11498.70s -> 11499.82s]  Turn it
[11499.82s -> 11503.03s]  Hello. Hello. Hmm. No one's there
[11505.67s -> 11523.27s]  Guess again. Oh, who is this? Wait? I'm not sure. Why are you you're under investigation now for the murder of
[11526.09s -> 11532.01s]  His name ken. Why don't I say ken operator alex lintrong speaking. Hi alex. I'm nancy
[11535.00s -> 11539.40s]  Hi, i'm nancy. I'm a detective trying to find out more. No, no, no, no, no, you don't go you don't i'm
[11540.28s -> 11542.28s]  Like don't I legally have to say i'm a cop?
[11543.35s -> 11548.07s]  Well, you have to be like before I say anything have to be like, oh that's great. By the way, i'm a detective with
[11548.79s -> 11558.58s]  You know, I do have to say that
[11558.66s -> 11564.10s]  You you legally have to you know, you legally have to say i'm a police officer. By the way, here's the rest of my sentence
[11564.98s -> 11566.98s]  That's in that's just movie shit
[11572.36s -> 11576.84s]  Why why am I saying that like cops are like what like a vampire if they're like a lot like wait
[11576.84s -> 11582.04s]  I know that wait. Hold on a minute. If if the cop comes to your door
[11583.18s -> 11585.18s]  Do you and they say can we come in?
[11585.96s -> 11588.14s]  If you invite them in
[11588.14s -> 11590.14s]  Hold on. I mean, I don't know these laws
[11592.38s -> 11594.54s]  All I know about police is through television
[11596.14s -> 11600.94s]  Does a cop have to announce they are a cop to you?
[11601.74s -> 11606.81s]  Does it does that have to happen?
[11606.81s -> 11608.97s]  Do cops have to tell you that they are a cop?
[11611.53s -> 11614.42s]  No, this is perfectly legal in most jurisdictions
[11614.82s -> 11620.50s]  Your question repeats one that is often asked as people for some reason assume that dishonesty by a police officer should always lead
[11620.82s -> 11628.10s]  To a dismissal it is only police tactics that could deprive you of some constitutional right that would lead to suppression of evidence in a subsequent dismissal
[11629.26s -> 11633.93s]  It's not entrapment
[11633.93s -> 11636.97s]  Entrapment does not simply mean that you were tricked into getting caught
[11637.37s -> 11642.97s]  Entrapment means that the police persuaded you to commit a crime. You had no intention of committing at the outset
[11643.53s -> 11649.45s]  In your case you intended to buy drugs all along you didn't just intend to get caught. There's no way what?
[11654.30s -> 11656.68s]  You aren't a police officer
[11656.68s -> 11662.82s]  Why i'm a detective
[11663.22s -> 11665.22s]  I'm a vampire. You shouldn't have done that
[11665.86s -> 11667.86s]  Well, like you know, like okay
[11668.18s -> 11670.18s]  I am a person outside your door
[11670.78s -> 11673.34s]  Yes, who is it?
[11673.34s -> 11675.42s]  I'm a cop. I'm a vampire
[11676.14s -> 11677.91s]  Can we come in?
[11677.91s -> 11679.91s]  Um, no, thank you
[11682.30s -> 11689.11s]  how does it
[11689.11s -> 11691.11s]  vampire cop
[11691.98s -> 11694.54s]  I'm a detective trying to find out more about magnus
[11698.87s -> 11700.87s]  Come back with a warrant vampire
[11705.02s -> 11708.14s]  I don't know if I can tell you why not vampire is just like
[11709.02s -> 11712.46s]  Can I come in? I just want to take a look around but you gotta invite me in first
[11713.82s -> 11715.82s]  Come back with a warrant. Okay
[11718.95s -> 11724.71s]  I'll come back with a warrant
[11725.11s -> 11731.91s]  Slow down and stay calm. I need your help. If what you're saying is true magnus might be in serious danger
[11769.50s -> 11777.24s]  Why would you write that?
[11789.18s -> 11792.49s]  All right, i'm back i'm back with up with my with my warrant
[11793.05s -> 11821.13s]  I'm back. Can I come in fuck? I put more on
[11846.14s -> 11848.14s]  That's been notarized
[11848.38s -> 11851.90s]  Can you imagine that's how you had to notarize documents?
[11852.70s -> 11855.66s]  This is the way that you notarized documents
[11857.32s -> 11861.48s]  Yeah, I need to get I need to get this bank statement notarized. Oh just one moment, sir
[11862.20s -> 11864.20s]  Okay, there you are
[11878.54s -> 11880.54s]  That's just the official
[11883.34s -> 11885.98s]  Let's go, but you don't have to handle this alone
[11903.08s -> 11907.00s]  I heard a voice on board. I mean he went to go check it out left the radio on
[11908.44s -> 11911.56s]  I'm not using that much lipstick. This is expensive lipstick
[11912.36s -> 11918.04s]  That's not what it is. I think this investigation just went from missing persons to abduction
[11918.44s -> 11920.76s]  It's dark out there and the water's cold
[11928.39s -> 11930.39s]  What brand is it? I don't know
[11932.09s -> 11934.66s]  um
[11934.66s -> 11936.74s]  Okay, this
[11936.74s -> 11939.70s]  This lipstick is called the the countess
[11943.33s -> 11944.71s]  countess
[11944.71s -> 11950.73s]  This vampire lipstick
[11955.78s -> 11957.78s]  this 20 bucks
[11957.94s -> 11962.26s]  pretty good
[11962.26s -> 11967.54s]  Could you hear anything magnus said something about the ship? That's all I got. I I was too scared
[11970.66s -> 11973.54s]  Who are you by the way? Just a lowly undergrad
[11973.62s -> 11980.15s]  A cubicle a pair of headphones and a computer. I'm here on an internship for my maritime psychology degree
[11980.71s -> 11982.71s]  My parents said I'd never find a paying job
[11983.11s -> 11989.35s]  Shows them me and magnus we were kind of buddies. I mean, we never met or anything
[11989.51s -> 11991.51s]  You guys don't know what the what the color is
[11994.47s -> 11995.75s]  All right, are you?
[11995.75s -> 11998.31s]  You don't sound Icelandic though. Nope
[11999.25s -> 12001.67s]  Massachusetts, so what are you doing here?
[12002.23s -> 12004.63s]  No, no, no, no those of you that are saying, oh wow
[12005.59s -> 12007.75s]  Really? I'm gonna laugh pink red
[12008.95s -> 12010.95s]  No
[12011.11s -> 12013.11s]  No, you don't understand
[12015.11s -> 12018.39s]  There are like four or five thousand different
[12019.11s -> 12020.71s]  red shades
[12020.71s -> 12022.71s]  Of lipstick that have different names
[12024.07s -> 12026.07s]  It's it's like willy wonka guys

[12120.23s -> 12123.35s]  Calling who am I calling?
[12123.43s -> 12129.59s]  What on earth is a maritime psychology degree? I have a 30 page thesis answering exactly that question
[12130.18s -> 12132.18s]  It can all be boiled down to two words
[12134.30s -> 12137.18s]  Interesting
[12137.26s -> 12139.37s]  Is he eating it?

[12155.21s -> 12161.29s]  There are some lipsticks and glosses that smell like candy and cakes and and pudding and stuff
[12162.52s -> 12164.52s]  And I have come very very close
[12165.08s -> 12167.08s]  To this one in particular that

[12240.33s -> 12242.49s]  Wax clay, whatever. Here it is
[12244.81s -> 12246.81s]  uh, it's made from
[12251.02s -> 12253.00s]  Here. Okay
[12253.00s -> 12255.00s]  It's made from like fruit pigments
[12255.24s -> 12257.26s]  fruit pigment
[12257.26s -> 12261.02s]  Strawberries are first juiced and then dehydrated into a powder. That's pretty cool
[12261.34s -> 12268.92s]  the powder is then soaked in oil to extract pigments and blended into a mixture of shea and cocoa butter done and then
[12269.80s -> 12273.48s]  Rice starch provides opacity giving the lipstick long-wearing coverage
[12274.20s -> 12276.20s]  right, and then
[12276.20s -> 12283.24s]  Uh candle candelilla wax from the candelilla plant allows the lipstick to hold its shape and then there it is
[12286.36s -> 12289.48s]  Yeah, it's made of the clay
[12289.48s -> 12292.20s]  Then they add the whale vomit. Okay. Well, what does it say that?
[12293.26s -> 12293.98s]  Oh wait, sorry

[12876.60s -> 12878.60s]  Sounds like her
[12879.80s -> 12885.11s]  I've always tried to get information about magnus's flight apart. I'm not showing that on stream. It's gonna scare people. I'm so disorganized
[12885.19s -> 12888.55s]  I can't match my thought colors, let alone keep records of magnus's charting
[12888.71s -> 12894.47s]  She always wanted to know when he'd be gone. I never told her obviously. What was she trying to do in his absence?
[12894.87s -> 12901.77s]  No clue, but I imagine how fucked up we've gotten as a society
[12903.26s -> 12907.98s]  Imagine how that explains why she's been hanging around. We have become
[12910.01s -> 12912.23s]  Were you as a person?
[12912.23s -> 12917.59s]  Are sitting somewhere and you need to look up if there is bat shit in your food
[12923.10s -> 12925.10s]  How did we get here?
[12932.39s -> 12934.31s]  I just was curious today
[12934.31s -> 12936.31s]  Am I eating animal shit?
[12937.06s -> 12948.14s]  I might be that's why i'm concerned to look what did you mean by daily logs earlier?
[12948.38s -> 12955.18s]  There are these logs i'm supposed to fill out whenever a vessel passes through us. So are they filled out kind of I turn
[12964.78s -> 12967.34s]  It's better than the old days when you ate bat shit
[12967.82s -> 12971.74s]  Versus guessing if it might be trace amounts in your food. I
[12977.42s -> 12980.86s]  That is kind of true. How cool are we talking?
[12988.46s -> 12991.40s]  What do you mean my thumbnail
[13004.30s -> 13008.82s]  What do you know about soren that guy who runs the festival yes

[13314.07s -> 13318.15s]  I paid 450 channel points for this and there are no refunds
[13320.10s -> 13323.38s]  Can I hear another ship fact? How about this before?
[13323.46s -> 13328.18s]  1865 captains sometimes had difficulty finding people interested in joining their crew
[13328.58s -> 13330.10s]  So they just started kidnapping them
[13330.10s -> 13332.66s]  They pay a big guy to go around a popular harbor
[13332.90s -> 13338.26s]  Not young men unconscious and not wake them up until they were far out that shit facts another shit fact
[13339.06s -> 13345.30s]  One particularly evil press gang or even threw himself a fake birthday party specifically to attract kidnapping victims
[13345.70s -> 13350.66s]  Of course justice was served when he himself was press ganged a few years later. I have a crush on this intern
[13350.66s -> 13352.66s]  What are you talking about? I'm out of here
[13355.11s -> 13359.03s]  No, i'm not putting the image of the scary one up i'm not putting the scary image up
[13360.50s -> 13364.34s]  No, you'll have to find that one. Baud watcher is good luck. Find that one. It's scary
[13367.78s -> 13369.78s]  Not quite. No, no, where's the blogging?
[13370.34s -> 13372.34s]  I'm gonna go to the lighthouse
[13373.48s -> 13375.48s]  Lighthouse lighthouse. I got it. I got it. I got it
[13378.49s -> 13380.49s]  All right, where's how do I get to the lighthouse?
[13384.26s -> 13386.26s]  Where's the light
[13386.42s -> 13390.90s]  It looks like the original hell someone made off with some of the decorations though
[13392.87s -> 13398.18s]  Uh an egg
[13398.18s -> 13409.24s]  I don't know
[13409.24s -> 13411.24s]  All the elements and a gun
[13416.82s -> 13417.94s]  turn
[13417.94s -> 13420.86s]  turn
[13420.86s -> 13425.34s]  Show image now show I wouldn't even have suckered puzzles. I haven't even done one in like 40 minutes
[13425.34s -> 13427.34s]  We've been too busy looking up bat facts
[13427.98s -> 13429.98s]  All right, I need to get to the lighthouse
[13430.06s -> 13435.11s]  How do I get to the lighthouse from here?
[13437.64s -> 13438.76s]  fuck
[13438.76s -> 13442.52s]  Prepare the lighthouse find and return the helms missing decorations
[13443.16s -> 13450.84s]  Figure out the sounding depth numbers search for clues. Check out the cabin outside of town find a light to use in the ice caves
[13452.17s -> 13453.93s]  Oh, I still have to do that
[13453.93s -> 13460.09s]  That's done. Can't check that off yet. Get in. Okay, can't check that off yet. Still have to do that. What?
[13467.54s -> 13470.42s]  What the how do I do anything?
[13471.22s -> 13475.62s]  If this section of the original ship was removed then maybe others were too
[13480.39s -> 13486.38s]  That was pointless
[13486.38s -> 13487.74s]  dude, I
[13487.74s -> 13489.82s]  I seriously I can't where am I supposed to go?
[13490.78s -> 13494.25s]  Go to the lighthouse
[13494.25s -> 13498.65s]  That image is fucked up. I know why do you think I don't want to show it because it's actually terrifying
[13504.49s -> 13506.42s]  Yeah
[13506.42s -> 13508.58s]  Elizabeth seems like she's withholding information
[13509.46s -> 13515.14s]  She still seems pretty intense about magnus as far as I can tell and she thinks the treasure belongs to her
[13515.62s -> 13517.62s]  I've seen some exes do some German
[13518.50s -> 13525.54s]  Looks like the other mother from core line. That's why when I end a relationship, I just move to a different continent and change
[13526.74s -> 13529.22s]  What?
[13529.22s -> 13531.22s]  Uh-oh
[13541.59s -> 13547.80s]  Fuck yeah. Yep
[13554.74s -> 13555.94s]  Yeah
[13555.94s -> 13559.78s]  My phone number so much easier than doing the whole breakup thing
[13560.42s -> 13562.82s]  That must be exhausting just quit the fucking game
[13563.62s -> 13567.70s]  I can't really do mailing addresses anymore quit the game. I'm
[13570.42s -> 13574.10s]  Make the game larger the game is it's from I can't
[13574.90s -> 13576.90s]  I can't okay. How do I?
[13577.78s -> 13579.62s]  I want solutions
[13579.62s -> 13581.70s]  I want solutions to problems
[13582.50s -> 13588.98s]  What do I do the egg?
[13588.98s -> 13591.30s]  The drew crew is just getting started. That's right
[13593.22s -> 13595.06s]  Don't don't let any
[13595.06s -> 13597.22s]  Drew crew naysayers tell you
[13598.10s -> 13602.82s]  That with the way that we're done playing nancy drew are streaming on upset
[13612.09s -> 13614.17s]  Two games done 30 to go. That's right
[13615.06s -> 13616.95s]  He's crying
[13616.95s -> 13618.95s]  No, i'm not
[13619.77s -> 13621.77s]  Oh, this looks like a door
[13621.77s -> 13623.94s]  lighthouse

[13646.04s -> 13648.28s]  Well, I need to go to sleep
[13648.44s -> 13650.68s]  I have to go to bed
[13650.68s -> 13653.72s]  Right, remember she was like, oh, yeah, you got I gotta go to sleep now
[13672.89s -> 13677.50s]  How do you sleep in this game
[13677.50s -> 13680.52s]  It was doom
[13680.52s -> 13682.60s]  Can I go to bed speak up now?
[13684.70s -> 13686.70s]  Soren told me about your boat crash
[13687.10s -> 13689.10s]  He will pay for a wagon
[13690.22s -> 13692.22s]  Seinfeld
[13695.90s -> 13698.78s]  Do we still have do we still have drew supporters in the chat right here
[13699.34s -> 13703.18s]  Is i'm gonna need to see a one miles away and he's a stranger forever
[13703.74s -> 13705.74s]  Well, that seems unfair to soren
[13706.06s -> 13713.42s]  Unfair means nothing you think because a culture is unfair. It will change for you. That is not the world
[13714.14s -> 13716.62s]  That is not skip bro. Later
[13717.98s -> 13719.98s]  Later would you like eggs?

[14291.30s -> 14293.38s]  Skip, okay. What does this mean?
[14294.18s -> 14297.59s]  What do I do with this info? I don't know
[14299.51s -> 14301.51s]  You're addicted to enancy true
[14302.23s -> 14305.75s]  I just want to see the end. No, I don't I just want to see like halfway through
[14306.94s -> 14312.31s]  Yeah, it's mostly halfway through
[14312.31s -> 14314.31s]  Then you got this guy getting new info
[14314.63s -> 14323.02s]  What's your relationship like with elizabeth presently quite poor? She won't allow certain
[14324.33s -> 14329.85s]  Members of the restoration team to access their work you mean dagny. Yes, but
[14330.41s -> 14335.53s]  Overall, she's quite a peach that one the only one who's ever shown me kindness
[14336.09s -> 14338.09s]  And the other half is happening tomorrow
[14338.89s -> 14341.13s]  I don't I I don't think we're doing too
[14342.57s -> 14346.57s]  Rocked the local mountains to their very core. I wonder if he's checked his voicemail since
[14347.45s -> 14349.53s]  Play ai dungeon now. I was planning on it
[14350.49s -> 14354.65s]  Did you lock magnus's cabin yes
[14355.21s -> 14360.97s]  No one should be going in there until the authorities search everything. Why not call the police believe me?
[14360.97s -> 14365.21s]  I want to but I live life one step away from an angry mob on my doorstep
[14365.29s -> 14367.85s]  Why do you think I stay in the culture center don't do tomorrow?
[14369.42s -> 14371.82s]  Ai dungeon tomorrow. Yeah, I guess sure
[14373.10s -> 14377.77s]  Well, you guess you could lie about it. You said two drew streams after jump night
[14378.73s -> 14380.73s]  That's that's correct still
[14385.35s -> 14391.35s]  So you're afraid to contact the police and no one else will it's less that i'm terrified and more than
[14392.39s -> 14397.91s]  Actually, yes, i'm terrified in these parts vigilante efforts are very much the norm
[14398.39s -> 14404.55s]  Even if the nancy drew dungeon, no one would talk. I hate to admit it, but it's up to us to crack this case. That sounds fun
[14407.21s -> 14408.33s]  Bye-bye
[14408.33s -> 14411.69s]  All right. I gotta let me let me go back to the uh, let me go back to the instruments
[14412.57s -> 14414.57s]  I gotta get that seinfeld theme, correct?
[14433.21s -> 14441.06s]  Where i'm looking for a uh, hold on a minute here. I'm just trying to take a look around the musical instruments
[14441.70s -> 14445.93s]  Just want to check something out real quick
[14446.33s -> 14459.70s]  Just want to quickly
[14460.58s -> 14466.98s]  Uh, I need to how do I open this I think I can open this
[14476.79s -> 14499.56s]  It should open why is it not opening why would it because i'm cheating and it says I can open it
[14500.62s -> 14502.62s]  That's a lang spill, right?
[14504.49s -> 14509.61s]  Open the lang spill
[14509.69s -> 14512.06s]  I can't open it
[14514.02s -> 14534.49s]  Yeah, what about it
[14534.49s -> 14538.89s]  Open the round case on the lang spill and see different pattern on each side of the decoration
[14538.97s -> 14541.13s]  This is the boomer strategy. The boomer guy doesn't work
[14542.78s -> 14545.78s]  Nancy doesn't know you can open it
[14545.78s -> 14546.74s]  What?
[14546.74s -> 14565.27s]  What do you mean nancy doesn't know you can open it. She doesn't know I have to know that I have to go get the
[14566.38s -> 14574.78s]  I did everything out of order from the guide. I haven't triggered that yet
[14575.42s -> 14577.98s]  I need to find a note
[14577.98s -> 14582.52s]  Where's this guy's note?
[14582.52s -> 14584.28s]  Okay, get the hook
[14584.28s -> 14587.64s]  I'm not done. No, i'm not done. This is not end of the stream voice. Don't even think about it
[14589.40s -> 14592.20s]  Vibe and chat vibe and chat here. I got it. I got you. I got you. I got you
[14598.02s -> 14600.02s]  I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you
[14602.31s -> 14604.31s]  Here go ahead. You guys can like vibe
[14611.48s -> 14617.11s]  All right, um, let's ship
[14617.43s -> 14621.02s]  Let's see. I got tools and I need to find a note
[14632.82s -> 14634.02s]  Get the key
[14634.02s -> 14637.46s]  Okay. Yeah sketch pieces crow's nest already did it
[14641.30s -> 14643.30s]  Go inside the wheelhouse. What the hell is that?
[14645.67s -> 14673.93s]  What's the wheelhouse?
[14673.93s -> 14676.09s]  All right, read the letters inside the box
[14677.46s -> 14685.59s]  Examine the box nancy says all the wooden sections should be pressed down inside that box there and there's letters in there
[14686.31s -> 14691.21s]  Let's go. Let's go read them
[14691.21s -> 14692.89s]  You guys vibing here?
[14692.89s -> 14715.37s]  Better be where's that dumbass box? I'm not vibing
[14716.65s -> 14719.91s]  Are you kidding? Are you serious?
[14719.91s -> 14721.59s]  Hey nancy
[14721.59s -> 14724.15s]  What are you talking about? You're not vibing
[14725.90s -> 14727.35s]  I
[14727.35s -> 14729.91s]  You spend a lot of time. You're really fucking with my vibe here
[14731.03s -> 14733.03s]  If you're not vibing
[14733.43s -> 14736.47s]  In case of a ship emergency i'm responsible. You don't know what that means
[14738.07s -> 14739.67s]  No, you're right. I don't
[14739.67s -> 14740.87s]  What does it mean?
[14740.87s -> 14743.75s]  I actually don't know what the actual doesn't do
[14746.15s -> 14750.07s]  Two people are vibing is to say that they're enjoying each other's company and converse easily
[14751.82s -> 14754.94s]  I was saying it wrong. I thought like vibing means like you just like hanging out and chilling
[14756.70s -> 14760.14s]  Things break suddenly and it's hard to hear the alarm from the harbor
[14760.54s -> 14762.14s]  I see
[14762.14s -> 14764.14s]  interesting
[14765.70s -> 14767.70s]  Goodbye, I need to get in that bag too
[14773.16s -> 14775.16s]  I'm not vibing right now
[14777.66s -> 14780.22s]  I need to get I need to read the stupid letters in here
[14787.45s -> 14788.57s]  Get me the
[14788.57s -> 14795.67s]  Okay, where's this dumbass thing?
[14797.56s -> 14800.04s]  Where's the box? What was that stupid box?
[14802.01s -> 14804.01s]  Why does everybody hide all this shit?
[14805.26s -> 14817.58s]  You like hiding hiding a picture of you and your dog. What are you doing? Is this where is it?
[14819.27s -> 14823.86s]  Where is it?
[14823.86s -> 14826.68s]  No, I already did this
[14826.68s -> 14828.68s]  I already did this I have to do this again
[14829.08s -> 14847.78s]  They've all got to be they've all got to be depressed down. All right open give me these damn
[14850.26s -> 14852.18s]  I wrote this

[14875.35s -> 14876.47s]  Love you
[14876.47s -> 14883.72s]  Well, dude, if you did you you put them in a box behind a weird puzzle
[14887.40s -> 14891.64s]  Like if I want kim to look at in the lang spill i'm gonna just set texture and say hey honey
[14891.72s -> 14893.72s]  Look in the lang spill
[14899.48s -> 14901.56s]  It's like when me and kim want to go to dominoes
[14902.66s -> 14905.06s]  I don't just it's not like oh, hey kim, uh, by the way
[14905.30s -> 14909.78s]  I'd like for you to figure out here to open up my sphere of puzzles to see what I want you to do today
[14920.07s -> 14922.07s]  Cursed cursed cursed. You're welcome
[14924.76s -> 14928.86s]  What is this a new image? This link gives me a virus

[14945.18s -> 14947.18s]  close close
[14954.47s -> 14957.75s]  Here we go. We got progress now. Thank you boomer gamers
[14958.55s -> 14968.63s]  There it is. It's subtle, but I see some differences in the halves of this pattern
[14970.34s -> 14972.34s]  Find the differences between the two mirrored sides
[14975.03s -> 14977.03s]  Now there's a lot. Okay, let's start at the bottom
[14981.88s -> 14987.10s]  Uh, there's three fingers
[14987.10s -> 14992.31s]  There is this one says no, okay. That's that one
[14993.56s -> 14995.56s]  um
[14996.12s -> 15048.18s]  There's no more
[15048.18s -> 15062.25s]  Cool a carved star. What am I supposed to do with that now? Oh, hey. Hey, Clarissa
[15068.44s -> 15082.66s]  Um, so what's this what's this? What was this one? What would I do now?
[15083.94s -> 15091.22s]  I'm just experiencing a walkthrough. No, nobody said that but I said that it's not what's going on. It's not what's going on
[15096.54s -> 15101.59s]  Let's go fix the dinghy motor
[15101.59s -> 15104.90s]  Somebody said boomer humor
[15104.90s -> 15108.90s]  You know boomer humor would be if I gave you like a quote from I love Lucy
[15110.18s -> 15112.18s]  Not Clarissa explains at all
[15115.03s -> 15121.62s]  What?
[15121.62s -> 15123.98s]  Let's fix this thing, huh?
[15123.98s -> 15129.93s]  Open it up
[15129.93s -> 15132.33s]  Okay. All right translate these first
[15138.42s -> 15140.42s]  Let's see. Where's that cool note?
[15143.10s -> 15148.79s]  Where's that cool note?
[15148.79s -> 15150.79s]  It's okay. I have it over here in the walkthrough
[15155.30s -> 15157.30s]  All right, so we need the voltage to be
[15157.70s -> 15163.34s]  um
[15166.66s -> 15180.36s]  What are you talking about do I
[15186.73s -> 15191.80s]  There it is I got the thing to translate voltage total
[15193.74s -> 15195.18s]  so there's my
[15195.18s -> 15198.22s]  My dinghy 16 9 19 13
[15199.10s -> 15202.17s]  I don't have any spark plugs
[15202.41s -> 15215.98s]  Will I open that thing?
[15215.98s -> 15220.36s]  I know what I have to do
[15220.36s -> 15226.87s]  Hello
[15226.87s -> 15228.87s]  Not quite yet need your help
[15229.83s -> 15236.30s]  What not quite yet
[15236.94s -> 15239.86s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[15272.09s -> 15280.07s]  Where do you get this where the spark plugs guys find on page spark plugs
[15280.55s -> 15293.74s]  I don't I don't care about this. I know that I got a guy in the dru crew saying like I don't care
[15294.76s -> 15296.84s]  I mean, what I what do you want me to tell you?
[15298.06s -> 15300.06s]  You think i'm gonna walk around in circles to try to find?
[15301.58s -> 15303.98s]  The one place where this is
[15304.46s -> 15305.98s]  That
[15305.98s -> 15307.98s]  Who the fuck wow, what are you talking about?
[15308.54s -> 15317.82s]  What are they just in there?
[15317.82s -> 15319.66s]  Vote him out of the dru crew
[15319.66s -> 15323.90s]  That's fine. That's fine. I I you can get you can you can fire me from president of the dru crew
[15324.86s -> 15327.48s]  Whatever. I still get to show up
[15328.12s -> 15334.18s]  Are they just in here?
[15341.24s -> 15345.08s]  I have it right here. What are you talking about? These are the spark plugs use them
[15346.04s -> 15354.54s]  Nancy
[15357.83s -> 15363.14s]  What do you want me to do
[15366.97s -> 15368.89s]  It's right in front of me
[15368.89s -> 15377.29s]  The language barrier solved the puzzle. I apparently can't speak icelandish
[15378.47s -> 15389.80s]  So I can't do it open the motor place the spark plugs and connectors in their location. I can't even touch it
[15393.24s -> 15395.24s]  I can't touch this. It won't let me
[15400.60s -> 15403.08s]  I have to play the translate game. I'm serious
[15411.32s -> 15413.32s]  I have to go play the translate game
[15414.81s -> 15424.02s]  No, I don't
[15424.02s -> 15426.02s]  You need the guide from the gift shop
[15426.18s -> 15435.64s]  What the fuck is this?
[15435.64s -> 15437.72s]  Maybe if I save a little more
[15444.71s -> 15446.82s]  Why
[15446.82s -> 15448.82s]  in seven hells

[15450.58s -> 15452.58s]  a make money
[15452.74s -> 15454.92s]  mini game in the game
[15454.92s -> 15457.64s]  but the only place for you to make money is to do
[15459.14s -> 15460.18s]  a
[15460.18s -> 15472.97s]  Minigame on a translator screen you guys want me to get the sword for seven thousand dollars. I have to sit here for like two hours
[15473.85s -> 15480.89s]  Cook food
[15480.89s -> 15488.22s]  I ain't doing that shit
[15488.22s -> 15500.10s]  mobile
[15500.10s -> 15503.22s]  So it's pretty much a 20 chance to get it right 25
[15505.22s -> 15533.19s]  All right, how much money do I need 1500 you could just learn
[15533.99s -> 15537.27s]  I'm not gonna i'm not gonna learn an entire language

[17412.38s -> 17414.81s]  That's not even accurate
[17414.81s -> 17417.61s]  I I expect the dru crew to get behind me on this one
[17437.68s -> 17439.68s]  Okay, I have to beat this

[19441.36s -> 19446.08s]  Uh four plus three, but I can't move 13. This has to act somebody said small numbers at the bottom
[19446.72s -> 19449.12s]  It's not true because I need to make 13
[19456.01s -> 19457.69s]  I had it correct
[19457.69s -> 19459.21s]  It's eight
[19459.21s -> 19460.57s]  it was
[19460.57s -> 19461.85s]  six and
[19461.85s -> 19463.18s]  and
[19463.18s -> 19466.81s]  Eight no six and eight and fuck

[19473.05s -> 19475.05s]  Uh four because I have a four
[19475.61s -> 19477.61s]  There's a four here, but I can't
[19477.77s -> 19483.29s]  Start at the top
[19483.29s -> 19485.29s]  Why would I start at the top 36 and
[19486.94s -> 19488.22s]  36
[19488.22s -> 19490.22s]  63 36 and
[19490.94s -> 19492.94s]  27 is
[19496.30s -> 19515.84s]  Hey, they're gonna get one of the chapter nancy drew
[19517.92s -> 19528.51s]  Drew I
[19528.51s -> 19532.03s]  She said she said that's the the big number at the top the big number
[19533.12s -> 19535.84s]  All right 20 36 46 56
[19536.64s -> 19538.00s]  That's not correct
[19538.00s -> 19540.00s]  There's 36 46 56
[19540.72s -> 19544.96s]  57 58 59 60 61 62 63. I need 27
[19545.84s -> 19547.84s]  27 so 13
[19548.16s -> 19550.32s]  Plus what is 27 13 24?
[19550.48s -> 19551.68s]  24
[19551.68s -> 19558.96s]  13 13, so i'm gonna have line around here somewhere 13 plus 14 is right there. All right 14 plus 14
[19559.52s -> 19561.52s]  24 24 22
[19562.08s -> 19564.80s]  We have 13 plus 13 23 9
[19565.92s -> 19568.96s]  And then we have 9 10 11 12 13 14 is 5
[19570.08s -> 19575.55s]  Oh 9 10 11 12 13 14 is 5. There's no 5
[19578.88s -> 19582.00s]  14 is 11 and uh
[19582.96s -> 19584.96s]  11 and 3
[19585.92s -> 19587.92s]  Okay, so now we got um
[19588.40s -> 19592.03s]  two and one
[19592.03s -> 19594.03s]  I'm blind to the top one
[19594.27s -> 19595.23s]  five and
[19595.23s -> 19596.51s]  I'm blind
[19596.51s -> 19599.95s]  Am I what was it again four 14 five?
[19600.59s -> 19604.51s]  What what am I doing? Uh, it was 12. No 11
[19605.31s -> 19608.35s]  What was it six and no seven?
[19608.91s -> 19611.79s]  Seven seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty. No, that's not correct. So eight
[19612.75s -> 19614.75s]  Nine was nine nine
[19615.55s -> 19617.79s]  Nine ten eleven twelve. That's thirteen. All right
[19618.99s -> 19622.67s]  Thirteen eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty. We need four. I got a four right here
[19623.31s -> 19627.63s]  Now we got five that doesn't equal that that doesn't make any sense. That's not correct. This is incorrect
[19627.71s -> 19629.71s]  I need the two over here. No, this is wrong
[19630.51s -> 19631.79s]  nine
[19631.79s -> 19636.16s]  fourteen, um
[19636.16s -> 19638.16s]  five and four is
[19640.54s -> 19641.82s]  Is there a zero?
[19641.82s -> 19644.75s]  replace 22
[19644.75s -> 19646.75s]  13 and five don't make 22
[19647.45s -> 19650.65s]  No, that's correct. So not 13 9 10 1 2 13 14
[19651.69s -> 19654.64s]  uh 7 and
[19654.64s -> 19656.64s]  9 4 2 3 4 9 4
[19657.44s -> 19659.44s]  9 4 2 3 5 9
[19659.68s -> 19661.76s]  4 2
[19661.76s -> 19663.82s]  3 5
[19663.82s -> 19665.82s]  4 5 6 is 6
[19665.82s -> 19667.82s]  5 and then 3 5 6 7 8
[19670.91s -> 19675.64s]  Something's wrong here
[19675.64s -> 19677.64s]  4 5 6 6 6 5 is not
[19680.25s -> 19684.73s]  One person did that one person get the logs and fucking type that in

[19725.20s -> 19727.20s]  Just give me a clip. I see a clip
[19734.09s -> 19737.02s]  Yeah, good image
[19737.02s -> 19741.44s]  It's basic matte. I don't care
[19741.44s -> 19743.60s]  It was wrong. Don't use it. It was wrong
[19747.12s -> 19749.00s]  What?
[19749.00s -> 19751.31s]  You guys got it wrong too, then
[19752.84s -> 19754.84s]  All right, 63 26. Okay, let's go
[19756.73s -> 19758.33s]  22 14
[19758.33s -> 19762.22s]  Uh, nine five eight
[19766.62s -> 19768.94s]  Six seven two three five six
[19770.46s -> 19776.38s]  Seven two three five. There it is. It was correct. Don't tell me it was wrong. It was right
[19780.35s -> 19783.87s]  Show this to future germo. Okay, what is it?
[19785.72s -> 19787.72s]  All right, you got it. I think i'm gonna go
[19787.88s -> 19793.48s]  All right, you got it. I think i'm gonna go get that coin. Can I like fucking scoop slam him and take over his place?

[19847.16s -> 19849.96s]  Most people think all pirates were men, but that's not true at all
[19850.20s -> 19855.00s]  In fact, there were dozens of famous lady pirates in the 16th and 17th centuries fix the game
[19866.89s -> 19872.57s]  After her mother died and her father was killed she became one of the most feared pirates in the caribbean at one point
[19872.65s -> 19874.65s]  She faked her own death during a battle
[19874.65s -> 19879.69s]  She went undercover and pretended to be a man for years when she finally revealed her true identity
[19880.01s -> 19886.01s]  Other pirates gave her the nickname back from the dead red because of her bright red hair bad feces facts
[19886.49s -> 19887.61s]  later
[19887.61s -> 19890.01s]  Talk to you later. Bye. What do I do now?
[19890.97s -> 19894.56s]  Okay, I had to turn this on so somebody could

[19906.04s -> 19910.51s]  Back to the ship. All right, right, right, and then I got a call
[19915.23s -> 19917.23s]  Back to the back to the radio room
[19919.56s -> 19937.61s]  You got it. Goodbye. Do you remember more? I'm not gonna say that because I don't get it. All right, uh, now what?
[19938.65s -> 19944.44s]  Who wanted me to turn the lighthouse on in the first place? Didn't she want to do that?

[19976.83s -> 19981.23s]  This must be the key to mangas's cabin. I'll just be borrowing this
[19981.87s -> 19985.52s]  Elizabeth never opened her gift
[19986.08s -> 19988.08s]  I don't remember one notes
[19994.68s -> 19998.92s]  All right. I got the key to the cabin. It's that door right there. Right the one that she was like don't go in there
[19999.72s -> 20013.52s]  Where's this in here? Open it. That's not the
[20015.16s -> 20017.31s]  That's not a cabin
[20017.31s -> 20021.72s]  This is not a cabin
[20023.84s -> 20031.36s]  How is that not a cabin the cabin is in
[20034.17s -> 20037.95s]  log cabin
[20038.59s -> 20046.46s]  Figure out what the lock in the cupboard opens. Why does it want me to still do this? Check that off yet. I don't understand
[20047.18s -> 20050.59s]  What the oh
[20050.59s -> 20094.11s]  Right. Wait one. There's only four numbers. I know there's probably more
[20095.26s -> 20098.94s]  All right, find it and return the helm's missing decorations. What the hell does that mean?
[20099.42s -> 20112.11s]  All right, let me I gotta find this cabin. Let's address the cheating see what it says
[20128.30s -> 20135.04s]  Okay

[20169.56s -> 20175.31s]  I could go this way
[20179.63s -> 20191.15s]  I thought I could before the cave there was a place to go left. Where is it left on the road?
[20192.51s -> 20196.60s]  Oh, that's no sign
[20205.05s -> 20218.27s]  Just a little why oh no checking in something's wrong tell me

[20278.88s -> 20280.88s]  Nancy, why am I on the cover of this?
[20280.88s -> 20285.87s]  Am I in my own universe? I don't understand
[20286.51s -> 20289.13s]  I got some edits. I want you to do
[20289.53s -> 20291.93s]  ooh buttons

[20329.36s -> 20331.36s]  Okay, I can't open this it's making a weird noise
[20334.44s -> 20341.96s]  These must belong with that reference. I saw earlier four of each color down and across no three together in a line four
[20348.76s -> 20350.76s]  Are you what is going on?
[20351.31s -> 20353.31s]  four of each color
[20353.71s -> 20360.59s]  You know in range of crystals according to the note about crystals four colors of each crystal in a row and column

[20414.89s -> 20417.37s]  Chat just do it. There's no way a human could do it
[20421.48s -> 20425.64s]  No true dru crew member would yawn at a nancy dru game
[20426.68s -> 20429.98s]  Why do I hate nancy dru? I don't
[20431.95s -> 20433.55s]  Why I don't
[20433.55s -> 20437.10s]  Let me see if I can figure this out
[20437.10s -> 20442.22s]  Four have to go across
[20442.46s -> 20449.92s]  If I go to these two down here, wait, hold on you need four of each in
[20450.32s -> 20457.40s]  So that means like they give me you don't have to be in a row. I could do wait. Hold on
[20458.04s -> 20469.80s]  Yeah, they don't have to be in a row
[20479.82s -> 20493.64s]  Yep, four. Okay, make them all blue then work backwards. I'm kind of i'm feeling it

[20832.16s -> 20834.16s]  only accumulate
[20837.12s -> 20838.64s]  Crow's nest
[20838.64s -> 20842.08s]  This is this is it solution is to divide into groups of six
[20842.64s -> 20846.64s]  No group touching another attempt after the festival crowds die down
[20847.60s -> 20855.82s]  a dog bed

[22550.48s -> 22553.68s]  Haven't done that that's done still have haven't done that
[22554.56s -> 22557.71s]  What is a gun whale?
[22557.71s -> 22566.57s]  So I have the locator now figure out the importance of the contents of the foot locker
[22567.37s -> 22570.00s]  Figure out what the lock in the cupboard it opens
[22570.96s -> 22575.12s]  Right. I still don't understand that one figure out the sounding depth numbers yet
[22578.96s -> 22580.96s]  No idea. What's the luggage?
[22581.36s -> 22584.30s]  There's luggage in somebody's room

[22656.70s -> 22661.42s]  I've got to figure like we've got new dialogue to have with people and why do I have this weird egg still?
[22663.00s -> 22666.04s]  Hey you you got anything new to tell me? Oh, hello there

[22673.48s -> 22677.40s]  I just saw someone take a sweater from the gift shop. Those are free, right?
[22678.28s -> 22681.64s]  No, all right. What am I eating tonight? You might want to look into that then
[22682.28s -> 22683.40s]  stop

[22712.75s -> 22716.24s]  There he was
[22716.24s -> 22718.24s]  Create volcanic winter
[22718.48s -> 22722.94s]  All right, buddy slow down
[22722.94s -> 22726.52s]  relax
[22726.52s -> 22728.76s]  Uh, what else over here?
[22729.23s -> 22734.99s]  Soren's desk note mentioned volcanic winter. Do these elements link up to that somehow earth?
[22736.11s -> 22742.11s]  And water equals glacier. I played this this is doodle god fire and air makes energy
[22742.83s -> 22746.03s]  energy and steam makes a geyser a glacier
[22747.07s -> 22750.44s]  a geyser
[22750.44s -> 22751.80s]  and steam
[22751.80s -> 22757.74s]  Okay, so now we need water
[22758.48s -> 22760.72s]  We need glacier and and um
[22761.36s -> 22765.02s]  Get this shit out of here
[22765.02s -> 22768.32s]  glacier and
[22768.32s -> 22769.68s]  energy
[22769.68s -> 22772.43s]  Is an erosion
[22772.51s -> 22776.62s]  A maelstrom
[22776.62s -> 22779.26s]  So I need to do uh, let's do fire water
[22780.06s -> 22782.06s]  earth glacier and energy
[22785.44s -> 22787.80s]  How about air and glacier?
[22792.48s -> 22794.48s]  Glacier and energy is erosion
[22795.04s -> 22797.04s]  steam and glacier is flood
[22797.98s -> 22801.58s]  Flood and geyser is a maelstrom flood and erosion is a maelstrom
[22802.38s -> 22804.38s]  flood and fire is is
[22805.18s -> 22808.35s]  Okay, cool
[22808.35s -> 22816.33s]  Let's get i'm gonna get these off
[22816.33s -> 22818.59s]  Let's do
[22818.59s -> 22823.31s]  Water and earth is glacier water and air is cyclone
[22824.28s -> 22825.88s]  water and fire
[22825.88s -> 22832.33s]  Steam water earth is glacier earth and air is desert
[22833.61s -> 22837.29s]  Earth and fire is lava and we've got them all in that category
[22838.17s -> 22839.92s]  lava
[22839.92s -> 22841.92s]  And energy is eruption
[22843.18s -> 22845.82s]  lava and steam is a geyser
[22846.46s -> 22848.46s]  Lava and desert is a rock
[22848.78s -> 22850.94s]  Lava and cyclone is rock
[22851.66s -> 22853.42s]  energy and lava
[22853.42s -> 22855.42s]  Energy and cyclone is flood
[22855.90s -> 22857.90s]  Desert and energy is dust cloud
[22858.46s -> 22860.94s]  Dust cloud and flood is a maelstrom
[22861.90s -> 22867.82s]  Eruption and dust cloud is volcanic winter. I will take it winter guest records
[22883.05s -> 22888.94s]  Why elizabeth haven't done that?
[22889.50s -> 22891.50s]  All right, somebody should probably read that
[22893.84s -> 22895.84s]  Hmm. Here's the luggage
[22896.32s -> 22900.78s]  Get that shit open. What do you got in here drew through take a quick look. Oh, yeah
[22902.06s -> 22903.10s]  Oh, yeah
[22903.10s -> 22905.10s]  Here is a landed sea
[22905.58s -> 22908.96s]  I'll probably need that at some point. Somebody will remember us. I'm gonna read that shit
[22909.92s -> 22912.08s]  All right, i'm ready
[22912.08s -> 22922.91s]  He's been gone for a really long time. What happened here?
[22923.55s -> 22925.96s]  Looks like there's been a struggle
[22926.44s -> 22934.14s]  It's dagny's phone, but where's dagny blood?
[22934.94s -> 22936.94s]  His password protected
[22944.19s -> 22972.03s]  Maybe note about this
[22972.19s -> 22979.44s]  The password is not true crew. Okay
[22980.16s -> 22983.02s]  I would know i'm in it
[22983.02s -> 23003.56s]  Does that work? I don't know what the phone is. I got bigger fish to fry here
[23004.52s -> 23016.96s]  Yes, guys, don't don't worry. I passed the fourth grade. I know it's not resident sleep or
[23017.76s -> 23028.40s]  Nancy. Hi, it's good to hear your voice
[23034.67s -> 23036.67s]  Why are you panicking? What?
[23039.39s -> 23041.39s]  Yeah, you gotta fuck off
[23042.19s -> 23047.85s]  It's kind of a sort of an intangible concept really when a guy like me begins ruminating
[23048.09s -> 23051.45s]  Let me tell you it can get pretty crazy up in the old noggin
[23052.17s -> 23054.25s]  Looking back on all the times we spent together
[23054.65s -> 23057.05s]  All those times you almost got seriously hurt
[23057.61s -> 23062.97s]  Like that one time you almost burned to death or that time when you almost got killed by that giant falling blade
[23063.69s -> 23065.69s]  Or on that raft in new zealand
[23066.09s -> 23071.13s]  Or that one thing with that mansion on fire. Jeez, what happened then? That's so non-sense
[23072.96s -> 23079.20s]  Well, oh maybe that one time that you almost burned to death, you know, I get lucky a lot and I kind of
[23079.68s -> 23083.60s]  Fall into things. Oh shit. Those are spoilers for other games that we're gonna play in the true crew
[23084.08s -> 23086.08s]  Future streams
[23103.26s -> 23108.14s]  Remember that time that you froze to death over fourth grade math twice. Yeah
[23109.02s -> 23113.18s]  Yeah, that's kind of funny that is funny that person said that's funny
[23117.90s -> 23135.85s]  Oh, i'm not sure how I feel ned i miss you okay i'll see you
[23138.81s -> 23144.32s]  Oh, I need to go to the cabin fucking yikes
[23148.04s -> 23151.32s]  Does net ever make an appearance in any of the games does he just die on the telephone
[23163.47s -> 23167.15s]  Why are they why are there two pieces of this? Why are there two pieces of this?
[23168.19s -> 23172.54s]  What is this two pieces of this for?
[23188.35s -> 23193.34s]  Oh, okay. I'm just gonna say why is this two pieces of this?
[23194.14s -> 23205.12s]  All right, this goes over here somewhere right there
[23206.80s -> 23208.80s]  Flower goes
[23225.28s -> 23230.78s]  It's over here somewhere it's over
[23230.78s -> 23232.78s]  Over here
[23240.40s -> 23242.57s]  Still missing pieces
[23242.65s -> 23244.65s]  stupid haven't done that
[23245.61s -> 23247.77s]  Haven't done that. All right, we're gonna find dagny
[23249.04s -> 23252.00s]  I still don't get what this thing is for. What is this for? We know
[23253.76s -> 23260.33s]  What do we do with the music box? I can't move metal pieces
[23261.13s -> 23262.73s]  They can't be touched
[23262.73s -> 23266.57s]  It's a puzzle dumbass
[23267.53s -> 23280.72s]  Well, some of you guys could do with some nice training some of you guys could do with a little bit of of nice training
[23292.01s -> 23299.18s]  You know what I mean? I know it's a puzzle
[23299.98s -> 23306.89s]  Don't you mean decency training?
[23309.00s -> 23311.00s]  Stupid fucking dumb fucking idiot
[23311.40s -> 23321.90s]  Idiot dumb fucking idiot
[23321.90s -> 23323.92s]  Okay
[23323.92s -> 23325.12s]  Let's go
[23325.12s -> 23334.09s]  What else is here?
[23334.09s -> 23338.65s]  Hello fiskeri. Do you have anything? How do you know elizabeth? How do you know elizabeth?
[23339.13s -> 23342.89s]  I've known her since she was a negative pre glimmer in her puppy's eye
[23343.29s -> 23350.33s]  Always had the local boys terrified. That was a new voice after again. She knows what she wants and heads put straight as an arrow
[23350.89s -> 23353.05s]  young men
[23353.05s -> 23355.05s]  Not so good with a woman like that
[23355.61s -> 23357.21s]  She's scary
[23357.21s -> 23360.65s]  I'm hungry. Oh, yeah, right. What what what what you guys think?
[23363.61s -> 23367.05s]  Still she lets me sleep on the official that's worth something
[23367.53s -> 23369.85s]  Did you know about her and magnus? No
[23370.97s -> 23372.97s]  We all did my fiskeri
[23373.61s -> 23376.17s]  She's toasties now. Not really unfortunately
[23376.81s -> 23378.81s]  No, this is good with waves. Not a bad idea
[23380.41s -> 23385.77s]  No skills to speak of he is. Um, how do you say it there? A runner he runs
[23386.33s -> 23390.17s]  Ouch. I'm glad he's not here. Let's vote on whether we should disband the drew crew
[23391.05s -> 23396.01s]  Now I can only speak the truth. This is the second time we've ever met. That was a side effect of shark bites
[23396.49s -> 23399.37s]  It is a curse. I bet that's not i'm not what?
[23402.03s -> 23408.27s]  I saw you taking a dinghy out fishing trip. You told me you gave up being on the water for good
[23408.75s -> 23414.19s]  It wasn't me. That sounded pretty good. My brother. Yeah, the other gunnar he um
[23415.39s -> 23416.43s]  gunner
[23416.43s -> 23419.00s]  Oh first that shark bite. I was
[23420.57s -> 23424.01s]  Looking for the treasure, but so far only empty hands
[23424.81s -> 23429.21s]  I think there's more to this story. Don't check me now girl the bull
[23431.18s -> 23432.38s]  Go
[23432.38s -> 23435.90s]  Not now
[23435.90s -> 23437.18s]  Not now
[23437.18s -> 23441.02s]  And fuck you. I have the treasure finder idiot
[23441.82s -> 23455.13s]  You're the dumb one
[23455.13s -> 23465.16s]  Uh, what do we do now?
[23465.72s -> 23475.21s]  Pete
[23475.21s -> 23480.16s]  What about you? Let's talk to you
[23480.16s -> 23483.10s]  Hey nancy
[23483.10s -> 23486.30s]  Uh, so you and soren work together you and soren work together
[23486.94s -> 23491.74s]  Yes, we both run the festival remove channel points I can't now i've already given to them
[23492.30s -> 23495.42s]  They dislike him. I'm definitely sensing some of that
[23496.30s -> 23498.30s]  Why not one of us?
[23498.38s -> 23500.94s]  He doesn't know our stories no shared memories
[23501.90s -> 23503.90s]  He mentioned that you've been kind to him
[23505.50s -> 23510.70s]  Being his friend has yeah, i'm gonna up the prices. Don't worry. You're either outside or inside in skip road
[23511.34s -> 23513.90s]  You cannot stand in the doorway. You will be driven out
[23514.46s -> 23518.70s]  We are not like great pick like a big city sounds like people are trying to get rid of him
[23519.26s -> 23524.22s]  Ruining the festival would be a great way to do that. Wouldn't it your words not mine?
[23525.56s -> 23530.94s]  Regardless, he is welcome in my home and that's my pub. I spent 5 000 points on a reverse tube
[23531.58s -> 23533.98s]  But I can offer a warm meal and a listening ear
[23535.66s -> 23540.86s]  Heard about the debt about the town's debt issues, I don't know what you're talking about
[23541.02s -> 23545.88s]  I have found some information in the culture center. So you
[23546.68s -> 23548.20s]  You want to gloat?
[23548.20s -> 23552.36s]  To chastise you can't you know these channel points to highlight an imger link of my mouth
[23553.24s -> 23555.42s]  Is that what you did?
[23555.42s -> 23557.42s]  Of course, it's joker
[23557.74s -> 23559.98s]  Yes, that's my fault
[23560.30s -> 23564.46s]  I won't sit here and defend myself. Why does every channel have points now twitch just put it through
[23565.02s -> 23566.38s]  And I was going to fix it
[23566.38s -> 23570.06s]  It is a new twitch feature that they have unlocked for I think a lot of people now
[23570.70s -> 23574.62s]  It just by default turns on and we gotta figure out what the hell to do with it
[23575.50s -> 23579.47s]  I'm really sorry to hear about year and magnus's breakup
[23580.35s -> 23586.43s]  It hardly matters anymore. I don't want to pry but if you want to talk about it, i'm here
[23587.23s -> 23591.07s]  Here's one for your case file. I've known magnus all my life
[23591.63s -> 23593.39s]  We dated four years
[23593.39s -> 23595.39s]  The winters are long and dark
[23595.87s -> 23601.15s]  We found each other in that darkness, but then he went through hard times
[23601.79s -> 23604.91s]  He became obsessed over the ship for a long time his world narrowed
[23605.39s -> 23606.67s]  Yeah
[23606.67s -> 23609.95s]  There was no room left for me. That's the end of it. Goodbye
[23610.67s -> 23611.87s]  Bye now
[23611.87s -> 23613.55s]  Bye
[23613.55s -> 23618.12s]  All right, get me
[23618.12s -> 23620.84s]  Where am I going? I don't know. What am I doing? I don't know
[23621.80s -> 23627.56s]  I don't know figure out the numbers figure out the numbers and go let me go back up
[23629.00s -> 23643.34s]  Am I gonna buy amd calls?
[23646.40s -> 23648.40s]  No, I don't fuck with the stock market anymore
[23657.80s -> 23660.48s]  Nothing's beyond me
[23660.48s -> 23666.16s]  Not since I was like it's there's no fucking way. It's gonna be that expensive
[23666.88s -> 23670.40s]  No way. It's so overvalued. It's not worth shit
[23672.06s -> 23673.66s]  And I was wrong
[23673.66s -> 23689.60s]  I want to get up to the crow's nest
[23691.04s -> 23692.88s]  Where's the crow's nest?
[23692.88s -> 23694.88s]  How do I get up to the crow's nest? Anybody know?
[23695.88s -> 23697.64s]  How do I get up there?
[23697.64s -> 23699.64s]  I want to get up on the crow's nest
[23699.64s -> 23704.00s]  Go back to the captain's cabin
[23717.36s -> 23721.39s]  I
[23721.39s -> 23725.08s]  Seriously
[23725.08s -> 23728.52s]  Just go down here. That's not where i'm trying to go, man
[23746.09s -> 23749.61s]  Fucking christ. Okay. What am I doing in here?
[23750.33s -> 23766.67s]  What is this thing? Do I still have fucked up lips? I don't know. Let's find out
[23768.06s -> 23770.88s]  probably
[23770.88s -> 23772.16s]  It looks okay
[23772.16s -> 23780.96s]  I've absorbed most of it. Not as bad. No, not as bad
[23798.64s -> 23803.37s]  Why do I have lopsided ears
[23803.45s -> 23808.49s]  I don't know because i'm a human and my genetic dna has made me look different than everybody else
[23809.29s -> 23813.45s]  And yeah, some of us have like a longer finger a bigger earlobe
[23814.25s -> 23819.93s]  A slightly elongated nose a big toe that is as big as three big toes put together some of it
[23820.25s -> 23822.57s]  That's i'm a human being i'm just a person here

[23848.76s -> 23859.28s]  So I would not have it any other way. That's the doggy kennel in magnus's note
[23860.24s -> 23863.93s]  What are you talking about
[23863.93s -> 23864.81s]  What?
[23864.81s -> 23868.09s]  Why does there a doggy key? What's the doggy key for?
[23873.16s -> 23878.52s]  Why do I have a doggy key for a fake member of the dru crew?
[23879.24s -> 23884.75s]  I bet you half the dru crew does not like this game. That doesn't mean we have to make fun of it
[23886.03s -> 23893.08s]  Is that for the music box? The dog key is for the music box
[23894.08s -> 23895.36s]  You shouldn't be

[24107.28s -> 24113.74s]  26
[24113.74s -> 24116.94s]  Cheating in the game for six-year-olds. I would love to meet the six-year-old that knew how to do that

[24601.10s -> 24603.10s]  best one guy moment
[24605.48s -> 24609.80s]  A moment where one person potentially changed the course of an entire stream
[24611.52s -> 24615.92s]  Best moment best one guy moment if you got a lot of them, then i'm sure there'll be plenty of nominees
[24623.55s -> 24625.98s]  worst gamer moment
[24625.98s -> 24630.54s]  Something that was just unbelievable that I I did it. It was so bad that you can't even
[24631.18s -> 24633.18s]  describe to anybody
[24633.64s -> 24639.88s]  Just how shitty that was whether I fell off a cliff in it or I did something like worst. It's terrible gaming video gaming

[24656.72s -> 24660.48s]  But I it is gonna ask it goes through the academy after the nomination process
[24662.22s -> 24666.97s]  Uh, and also best gaming moment something that I did something you never thought I was ever gonna do
[24667.69s -> 24670.16s]  something that was
[24670.16s -> 24673.28s]  You kind of cock your head to the side and go how did he just do that?
[24678.16s -> 24683.76s]  So worst gamer moment and best gamer moment also making a new appearance. Oh, not a new prince but coming back
[24684.72s -> 24687.12s]  Worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up
[24687.76s -> 24694.88s]  And best joke taking more than five minutes to set up. I think I don't have to explain what those what that means
[24698.32s -> 24703.93s]  guys every single one of these is you can't just say today there's been like
[24705.35s -> 24709.29s]  250 streams or something this year is you it's just fresh in your memory

[24717.84s -> 24720.40s]  What do you think? What's the worst stream of the whole year?
[24722.12s -> 24724.12s]  Of this one get out of here
[24725.76s -> 24729.98s]  Making a new appearance this year because it's very important. I'm
[24730.62s -> 24733.44s]  This one. I don't know how this is gonna play out
[24734.62s -> 24737.90s]  Because there's been a lot. I don't know what the nominees for
[24738.78s -> 24740.78s]  worst joke of the decade
[24741.10s -> 24743.10s]  Will be that also includes youtube
[24746.36s -> 24750.04s]  Because we are at 2020 and I have been doing this for almost 10 years
[24756.19s -> 24758.43s]  I've been on youtube and on twitch for
[24759.15s -> 24760.19s]  just
[24760.19s -> 24762.19s]  Barely under 10 full years
[24762.84s -> 24767.84s]  Worst joke of the whole decade
[24767.84s -> 24772.41s]  Best joke of the whole decade. What do you think is the best thing i've ever done like joke was
[24778.86s -> 24782.86s]  Best joke of the decade. Good luck with your nominations. And then one final thing
[24786.03s -> 24788.03s]  This is a this is just fun
[24789.55s -> 24790.99s]  I could do it on my own
[24790.99s -> 24793.39s]  I maybe I was going to think of maybe surprising people about this
[24793.39s -> 24797.71s]  But even I and a few other people that I would bring on to try to do this wouldn't know all these
[24799.00s -> 24801.00s]  We're going to do a compilation
[24801.58s -> 24803.74s]  For all the times i've lied on this stream
[24804.64s -> 24810.51s]  or on youtube
[24810.51s -> 24812.68s]  so if you if you have
[24812.76s -> 24815.08s]  uh
[24815.08s -> 24816.76s]  if you have
[24816.76s -> 24819.80s]  Something that you would like to nominate for a time that I have lied
[24820.52s -> 24822.36s]  And you can give proof
[24822.36s -> 24824.04s]  You can show it
[24824.04s -> 24828.68s]  I'm going to make a large compilation video of every single time i've lied
[24831.60s -> 24833.60s]  Ever or just this year ever?
[24838.57s -> 24840.57s]  All lies of the decade
[24848.78s -> 24850.78s]  That would give us 20
[24851.48s -> 24853.48s]  Well 19 categories
[24856.12s -> 24858.41s]  does anybody
[24858.41s -> 24859.45s]  have
[24859.45s -> 24861.20s]  a category
[24861.20s -> 24863.12s]  They would like it for a viewer's choice
[24871.02s -> 24872.62s]  19 categories
[24872.62s -> 24874.62s]  I'd like to make it a clean 20
[24876.30s -> 24882.38s]  Best category worst category. I removed the me me shitty ones like best ice cream worst category best category
[24882.38s -> 24884.62s]  They would just fill her dog shit. They're not in it this year
[24889.80s -> 24895.32s]  Best and worst face worst face is on there. I'm not sure you can have a best face and worst face
[24895.40s -> 24897.40s]  What would a best face be?
[24897.40s -> 24899.96s]  What would what would a best face be?
[24901.16s -> 24904.70s]  Loudest vroom. I mean that's not even
[24905.10s -> 24907.10s]  I know that's not even nominations
[24908.19s -> 24910.99s]  That's just what was the loudest car go? Okay. All right
[24911.15s -> 24915.79s]  We have to have we have to find it somebody's we got to find the loudest rooms of the year
[24920.49s -> 24922.89s]  Let me add this let me add this that's so stupid
[24924.32s -> 24926.32s]  loudest fucking rooms
[24927.61s -> 24931.95s]  Oh shit, hold on
[24931.95s -> 24933.95s]  Why is this I don't want to do that
[24935.05s -> 24938.56s]  Jump king is not gonna win
[24938.56s -> 24940.86s]  I would be shocked
[24940.86s -> 24944.78s]  Best ignore stream moment. How's anyone gonna find that? That's a good question
[24945.58s -> 24949.10s]  That's a really good question
[24949.10s -> 24950.86s]  Hey, any nancy droop
[24950.86s -> 24958.65s]  Now, where's my writing music?
[24958.79s -> 24960.43s]  writing
[24960.43s -> 24963.07s]  Music, where is it? I like that stuff. It was good. Here it is
[24967.87s -> 24973.87s]  Okay, so uh anything else besides uh, the loudest of rooms of the year
[24979.74s -> 24981.42s]  loudest of rumors
[24985.26s -> 24988.88s]  Anything else
[24988.88s -> 24991.60s]  Best beatbox moment. I don't know if that works
[24992.64s -> 24996.09s]  loudest rumors of the year
[24998.75s -> 25000.75s]  best chat image
[25003.44s -> 25007.02s]  best
[25007.02s -> 25011.34s]  Best comment germa has read that's kind of a one guy. That's that could be filled in the one guy moment
[25015.68s -> 25017.85s]  best clip
[25017.85s -> 25019.29s]  Best clip of the year
[25019.29s -> 25024.81s]  I feel like it's tough to do best clip of the year because the best clips of the year might actually be in a bunch
[25024.81s -> 25037.39s]  of these categories
[25037.39s -> 25040.51s]  Isn't that just one of the most yeah, that would be like the most viewed ones wouldn't it? Yeah
[25044.49s -> 25046.49s]  Worst excuse of the year
[25047.13s -> 25049.13s]  Best qrs
[25049.69s -> 25055.20s]  Well, it would just be the original one that happened that happened this year, right? I feel like that's gonna get nominated for something
[25062.86s -> 25069.05s]  best singing moment
[25069.05s -> 25072.17s]  That was this. Yeah, that was like in January February. I think
[25072.89s -> 25076.35s]  How about best singing?
[25079.15s -> 25085.79s]  I feel like they can only be five or six nominations for best singing only because i've probably only done singing like that
[25086.35s -> 25088.35s]  Four or five times this whole year
[25096.04s -> 25098.36s]  Do I do that a lot? I sing a lot
[25101.90s -> 25105.50s]  It could that be a worst singing and best singing of the year
[25106.22s -> 25111.72s]  I don't think that it could happen
[25112.36s -> 25114.36s]  It's gonna be hard to find
[25119.56s -> 25120.68s]  All right. I'm gonna put it on here
[25120.68s -> 25123.80s]  But remember keep in mind some of these categories might get removed
[25124.88s -> 25128.06s]  If they have two nominations, you know
[25128.94s -> 25138.03s]  I'm not gonna do a full thing for that. All right, let's do that. What best and worst singing of the year
[25138.59s -> 25147.40s]  Let's put it right here
[25147.40s -> 25149.40s]  worst singing
[25150.60s -> 25152.60s]  and best singing
[25155.36s -> 25158.00s]  I already know what's gonna be nominated here like thousand times
[25161.56s -> 25175.98s]  Also, I don't want to go too far and have 30 categories. Why not something about the community like best community created content
[25176.54s -> 25179.26s]  Oh, I don't I don't want I don't really want to do that
[25180.16s -> 25184.32s]  Because I don't want to make community content a contest that will show up at the end of the year
[25188.20s -> 25192.28s]  Kim and auto best kim or best auto moment
[25193.72s -> 25197.24s]  I can name you four or five times or he just kind of kim opened the
[25199.60s -> 25201.60s]  All right. That's a joke
[25201.60s -> 25203.60s]  that's a joke category because
[25204.40s -> 25206.64s]  It's going to be the same clip five times in a row
[25207.36s -> 25210.16s]  it's going to be kim opening the door behind me and
[25210.64s -> 25212.80s]  auto in her arms
[25212.80s -> 25217.18s]  Four or five times in a row. It's not even
[25221.28s -> 25229.15s]  Just auto moment. All right, best auto moment. I'll allow it. That's just that's stupid enough for me to think it's funny
[25229.55s -> 25231.55s]  All right, best auto moment
[25242.59s -> 25245.15s]  Okay, I think that's good
[25245.95s -> 25250.60s]  Worst hair new character face beater chat experience
[25251.48s -> 25259.36s]  Best auto moment best and worst singing best and worst noise best and worst impression worst meltdown
[25259.92s -> 25262.64s]  Best one guy moment best and worst gaming moment
[25263.20s -> 25268.96s]  Best and worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up best and worst stream of the year best and worst joke of the decade
[25269.44s -> 25279.80s]  Times i've lied and loudest rumors of the year. Peter is a year-old meme. I know it goes. I'm good
[25280.68s -> 25284.84s]  I want it there. I want it there because I know i've said it a few times this whole year
[25285.16s -> 25287.16s]  Who the fuck's even going to find it though?
[25290.88s -> 25292.88s]  It's time to retire Peter
[25292.96s -> 25294.48s]  No, it's not
[25294.48s -> 25298.32s]  No, it's not not in nest. I okay i'll retire it after this
[25299.36s -> 25302.40s]  But the people that aren't here right now that are going to watch that stream
[25303.24s -> 25305.96s]  I want them to see that category and roll their eyes
[25306.68s -> 25318.24s]  All the way to the back of their head. That's the only reason why it's on here worst
[25319.20s -> 25321.37s]  cat puke
[25321.37s -> 25324.49s]  If you think that that's a bad noise or a best noise go ahead and nominate it. We'll see
[25333.15s -> 25338.44s]  Best scared moment. It's gonna get bloated. It's gonna get bloated
[25343.18s -> 25346.14s]  It's it's gonna start with I gotta put the can on it
[25350.68s -> 25359.74s]  Biggest all right. How about just instead of just biggest scare or best scare best scared moment. Okay, that that works. That's good
[25364.20s -> 25369.64s]  All right, and that's it. That's i'm capping it here. I'm capping it here. Best scared best scare moment. There you go
[25378.75s -> 25380.27s]  So, let's see. We got
[25380.27s -> 25383.39s]  One two, three, four, five six, seven, eight nine ten
[25384.27s -> 25392.54s]  Twenty twenty one two twenty three that's twenty three categories. I don't like that. That's like a scary like fucking horror movie number
[25392.94s -> 25394.54s]  Uh, so we need one more
[25394.54s -> 25409.82s]  Or i'm deleting one best jubate moment
[25410.70s -> 25412.94s]  No, not best not quietest of room

[25530.17s -> 25532.17s]  So you can see and you can read the rules there
[25532.41s -> 25534.41s]  basically we want
[25534.79s -> 25536.43s]  category

[25570.00s -> 25572.00s]  All right. That's it

[26342.94s -> 26345.18s]  It's a cult and I'll have nothing to do with it
[26345.90s -> 26350.03s]  It's not a cult
[26350.03s -> 26355.71s]  it's a group of people that come together that are not part of any type of religion or any we just get together and we
[26356.67s -> 26358.67s]  Play the same game together
[26358.83s -> 26364.54s]  What is the definition of a cult?
[26364.54s -> 26368.70s]  What's the actual debt a system of religious? Yeah. We're not a religion. Sorry

[26457.23s -> 26461.82s]  I flew off the handle during the that like red light green light
[26462.70s -> 26468.30s]  Light up the white light segment. I didn't I say that there was like the 27 of these games were worthless or something
[26468.30s -> 26470.30s]  I was really mean
[26470.30s -> 26475.44s]  I'm supposed to be the leader of the of the drew crew and I said like every one of their games is terrible or something
[26476.00s -> 26478.86s]  This is why nobody talks to me
[26478.86s -> 26483.98s]  Because I can't like oh dude. I wonder if like germa talks to any game companies. No, no, they don't they don't nobody
[26484.06s -> 26488.40s]  They don't they won't talk to me
[26488.40s -> 26496.28s]  I that'll never happen. Dude. Does germa have like any sponsorship opportunities with a couple of companies though?
[26496.28s -> 26501.88s]  They probably watched the xbox 360 red dead rant and they probably are like, holy fuck don't close that window
[26511.63s -> 26516.91s]  old navy gaming

[26531.66s -> 26535.93s]  It's true though proof. He hates games. Let's see
[26537.34s -> 26539.34s]  Now I know this one. This is when I say that
[26541.18s -> 26545.15s]  I thought that was edited for a second not edited
[26545.79s -> 26547.79s]  somehow
[26548.51s -> 26551.00s]  Listen to that part right there
[26552.68s -> 26561.20s]  Is that is that impossible for human to do that? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
[26565.92s -> 26567.92s]  Maybe it is
[26570.03s -> 26576.43s]  Video games suck video games suck video games suck video games suck all video games none of them were fun
[26577.39s -> 26579.95s]  That's not even a meltdown. That's just me speaking facts
[26579.95s -> 26583.34s]  Hey
[26585.10s -> 26587.10s]  Sick kilos
[26588.62s -> 26591.58s]  Uh sec kilos thanks for the 500 bits germa
[26591.66s -> 26596.14s]  I recently bought red dead on xbox with backwards compatibility, but it says I don't have a card on file
[26596.22s -> 26600.62s]  Do you have any experience with this issue? I know you played it on stream and like 20
[26601.10s -> 26603.10s]  Did I didn't even read this one?
[26603.42s -> 26605.10s]  until right now
[26605.10s -> 26607.10s]  This is from two hours ago, by the way
[26607.50s -> 26616.25s]  I didn't this is I just saw this right now a card on file. Why would you have to have a card on file?
[26616.25s -> 26619.12s]  I don't I still don't get that
[26619.12s -> 26621.12s]  I want to buy something from your store
[26621.92s -> 26625.28s]  Okay, please, uh keep put a card in so we can store it and then buy it
[26626.44s -> 26628.44s]  Just let me buy it
[26628.52s -> 26630.52s]  You sure you don't want to store the card and then buy it
[26633.64s -> 26637.58s]  Here we go again
[26637.58s -> 26640.62s]  Uh, we had 120 community subs come in in
[26641.26s -> 26643.02s]  30 seconds of each other
[26643.02s -> 26644.86s]  Anonymous gave 100
[26644.86s -> 26650.62s]  Whoever you are. Thank you for your insane contribution and then nat kitty gave 20 right after it
[26654.94s -> 26657.85s]  Thanks guys
[26657.85s -> 26660.49s]  And why don't we take a look at how fast is it going to fly by?
[26661.13s -> 26663.13s]  Because they were a shitload of community subs
[26663.37s -> 26665.68s]  Let's just bump you here quick. Sorry about that
[26666.38s -> 26667.82s]  Uh, let's run them
[26667.82s -> 26671.95s]  Good luck reading those
[26671.95s -> 26674.62s]  It's hundreds of people
[26674.62s -> 26676.06s]  Thank you guys
[26676.06s -> 26678.33s]  And thanks to the people that
[26678.33s -> 26681.77s]  For some reason drop huge huge amounts of money on this stream
[26682.75s -> 26685.44s]  Much love to you. Thank you
[26685.44s -> 26689.12s]  Thanks for continuing to allow me to do the things that I do the things that I want to do
[26689.52s -> 26690.32s]  So
[26690.32s -> 26692.96s]  Am I ever gonna watch joel's movie and maybe a few years?
[26693.68s -> 26702.72s]  Uh, it's not done yet. I heard
[26702.72s -> 26704.00s]  But seriously
[26704.00s -> 26706.24s]  It's a lot of people. Thank you guys
[26706.80s -> 26710.17s]  We still have a few more bits to do. We have future gamer for 250
[26710.81s -> 26712.89s]  Uh insane cannibal caught on stream
[26717.55s -> 26729.23s]  It's actually kind of scary look at this scary image
[26730.03s -> 26737.93s]  Not that one
[26737.93s -> 26740.49s]  Not that one. It's a different one. I mean, that's also pretty scary
[26741.37s -> 26756.09s]  There you see him
[26756.09s -> 26757.37s]  You see
[26757.37s -> 26758.72s]  Where is it?
[26764.16s -> 26768.12s]  I see him
[26768.12s -> 26770.12s]  Enhance it. I will I just i'm gonna cover up this up
[26775.39s -> 26779.07s]  Wow before we do that
[26779.07s -> 26783.63s]  That was this future gamer's image. We also have 250 from butt squire who has a couple of images
[26784.27s -> 26786.27s]  There's me as the joker
[26787.07s -> 26794.36s]  I do I feel like you did. Did you enhance this?
[26794.92s -> 26798.60s]  Here find me find me. Okay. So where is he? I think I see him
[26799.32s -> 26814.64s]  Here's another one to look at
[26814.64s -> 26818.28s]  Yep
[26818.28s -> 26822.33s]  Yep
[26822.33s -> 26826.33s]  Okay, that was from butt squire. Thank you butt squire. Uh, very nice
[26826.33s -> 26830.01s]  Thanks for the thousand bits. I dreamed that I was sitting on a public toilet
[26830.41s -> 26835.05s]  And I heard you talking in the adjacent stall about how global warming is killing elephants
[26835.61s -> 26838.73s]  I was surprised to say the least also any thoughts on doing twitch sings
[26840.65s -> 26842.73s]  I will do twitch sings after new years
[26843.45s -> 26847.69s]  because I just put a category for best and worst singing on stream
[26848.65s -> 26853.61s]  And I feel like if I do that stream before the new years that'll take up every single slot
[26855.24s -> 26861.56s]  Maybe but thank you for the thousand bits ten bucks from very nice. Thank you
[26862.20s -> 26866.03s]  Appreciate that
[26866.03s -> 26870.19s]  Uh snooze and copter. Thanks for the 250. I was curious if you can imagine the taste this would have
[26870.91s -> 26872.91s]  Because for the weirdest reason I do
[26873.79s -> 26878.43s]  Everyone that had one of those old tvs probably can try it. Can I taste this?
[26879.79s -> 26885.23s]  Let's see. Can I taste this?
[26894.09s -> 26899.04s]  all right, uh
[26899.04s -> 26902.32s]  Taste this. Mm. So I can smell this
[26903.12s -> 26907.60s]  It smells like electricity. Do you guys know that kind of heavy
[26908.70s -> 26913.20s]  Electricity almost metallic smell that electricity smell
[26916.62s -> 26918.62s]  I know that there's people that can't
[26920.06s -> 26922.06s]  I think some people can't sense that right
[26922.70s -> 26927.90s]  You're like ozone. It's like that ozone smell that ozone in your nostrils and in the back of your throat
[26931.02s -> 26933.07s]  Yeah, I can taste this image
[26933.07s -> 26935.71s]  Yep
[26935.71s -> 26938.19s]  Any chance you're also going to revisit the sims with new mods
[26939.47s -> 26942.83s]  Maybe one of the older sims games too because they have other wacky mods
[26945.44s -> 26947.04s]  um
[26947.04s -> 26951.28s]  I feel like I did the sequel and I did the sims 4 and then I did the sims the sims 4 sequel
[26951.68s -> 26956.00s]  I feel like if I want to do that again, I would probably go back to one of the older ones and do something ridiculous
[26956.80s -> 26962.78s]  Because I've never really played the sims 2 or the sims 3 on stream
[26963.50s -> 26967.00s]  But yeah, I thought about it. That's what I was asking
[26968.28s -> 26970.12s]  Oh, yeah. Yes
[26970.12s -> 26971.69s]  Yes
[26971.69s -> 26977.69s]  Hey 25 dr. Pepper over 25 flavors in dr. Pepper. Thanks to the 250 worst impression goes to ed stark
[26977.69s -> 26980.09s]  You're not going to do it. I don't think that was this year
[26980.89s -> 26982.89s]  I think that may have been two years ago
[26983.29s -> 26993.29s]  Two more bits to do and then we're going to take off and see tomorrow for ai dungeon and maybe some more nancy drew crew
[26998.14s -> 27002.80s]  Esparta escalada thanks for the 250. Hey germa. I had an awful christmas celebration with my family today
[27003.44s -> 27006.24s]  And his dreams always cheer me up when I feel bad. Just want to say thanks
[27006.96s -> 27012.91s]  I'm really sorry to hear that
[27012.91s -> 27015.07s]  Nobody deserves to have a shitty christmas
[27016.32s -> 27020.43s]  I'm sorry to hear that
[27020.43s -> 27023.87s]  Regardless of however you celebrate it. I know people some people do a few days early
[27023.87s -> 27026.75s]  Some people do a few days after family travels. I understand. I get it
[27028.92s -> 27030.68s]  I'm sorry to hear that but
[27030.68s -> 27034.64s]  If this stream can cheer you up
[27034.64s -> 27040.99s]  I'm happy it can
[27040.99s -> 27042.91s]  very happy
[27042.91s -> 27051.00s]  Can we get one more germa wink before you leave? No, i've i've removed my shirt. It's off. I had to take it off
[27051.00s -> 27053.00s]  It's like I got lipstick all over it
[27056.33s -> 27058.33s]  But thank you esparta escalada
[27058.81s -> 27066.09s]  Anything else show official thanks for the 500 of bits not encouraging your nancy drew here's some stuff that is not encouraging your nancy drew stream
[27067.05s -> 27069.69s]  Also, just posted some images and projects in the discord for you
[27073.64s -> 27075.64s]  What on earth is going on here?
[27076.20s -> 27078.20s]  All right. This is uh
[27079.72s -> 27082.09s]  I like this one
[27082.09s -> 27084.09s]  This one is also a scary image
[27088.54s -> 27090.54s]  We got fucking scary images
[27092.89s -> 27095.77s]  This one is this is the scary one. We'll just do that one now
[27096.49s -> 27102.57s]  It's very large this is in blunder so you probably can guess what this is going to be
[27111.16s -> 27120.17s]  Jesus christ, what's wrong with my eyes?
[27124.23s -> 27136.49s]  Confirmed bald the more I look at it the more I feel like it's staring into me. I have to get it off the screen
[27138.25s -> 27150.40s]  Here's the other one
[27156.81s -> 27159.44s]  God damn it. Oh
[27164.54s -> 27166.54s]  And we also had from tingy
[27168.70s -> 27170.14s]  Thank you tingy
[27170.14s -> 27173.92s]  for the 250
[27174.00s -> 27181.31s]  And they say listen tingy say i'm still hoping you can get that rollercoaster tycoon 2 mod working where we're the guests in the park
[27182.67s -> 27186.35s]  I don't think you can
[27186.35s -> 27188.59s]  because
[27188.59s -> 27190.59s]  From what I understand
[27190.59s -> 27194.43s]  It's just not it just doesn't work anymore. Just not on anymore
[27195.15s -> 27198.83s]  The server is turned off and I would have to make my own server to host it or something
[27199.63s -> 27209.96s]  I think that was what we came to the conclusion of I can host it. I can host it. I can host it
[27211.55s -> 27215.71s]  There was a lot more to it and it took it was going to take probably another few days to figure that out
[27217.31s -> 27221.29s]  But i'm looking forward to tomorrow. We're going to do ai dungeon
[27223.42s -> 27225.82s]  This was this stream was very strange
[27227.05s -> 27229.29s]  Uh, I feel like this was like six streams
[27230.01s -> 27233.47s]  Because i'm thinking about the activities that were done and the things that happened on this stream
[27233.95s -> 27236.35s]  And I feel like that was over the course of the last like four days
[27237.31s -> 27240.06s]  That was a lot of different streams together
[27240.62s -> 27242.86s]  I was like changing channels in my brain
[27245.95s -> 27250.30s]  All right
[27250.30s -> 27253.58s]  Good night guys. I'll see you tomorrow ai dungeon may be finishing up nancy drew
[27254.30s -> 27256.49s]  for the drew crew
[27256.49s -> 27277.47s]  Good night. See you tomorrow
