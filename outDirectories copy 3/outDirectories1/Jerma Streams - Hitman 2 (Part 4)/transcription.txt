[1.08s -> 13.82s]  Hey, pay no attention to all the drop frames right now. Don't worry about that. It's because
[14.62s -> 21.96s]  I had to re-download all of the DLC again. Remember I came in here and I was like,
[21.96s -> 24.84s]  hey no, it looks like that wasn't the problem. I was too embarrassed to come back and tell you
[24.84s -> 32.95s]  that that's what was happening. So I had to re-download the DLC. And I was like,
[32.95s -> 40.20s]  no, it's all good. I didn't have to do that. I restarted Steam and the download started again.
[40.20s -> 46.18s]  So we have about two minutes before I can open Hitman 2. I was like, should I come in there?
[46.18s -> 52.07s]  Are people going to laugh at me when I tell them this? Probably. Why am I using so much CPU right
[52.07s -> 65.69s]  now? Hitman's not even open. Why am I dropping so many? What? Hold on. What's going on with my
[65.69s -> 82.86s]  computer? I'm at 50% CPU. I'm not doing anything. Hold on a second. Oh, this is not... Watch me
[82.86s -> 89.14s]  burn out my CPU. No, and now I'm going to have Hitman open when I'm already at 50%.
[90.42s -> 95.91s]  Is it... Am I installing a Windows update? Oh, it's because it's installing Hitman. That takes CPU?
[97.74s -> 105.38s]  No, it doesn't. That uses HDD. That uses hard disk drive. That doesn't use that much CPU, does it?
[111.69s -> 121.19s]  HDD in 2019. You think I got any moving parts in this thing? I got all SD. That's how you know
[121.19s -> 130.55s]  that was a funny lie. HDD. But I'll give you... I'm going to refill this. I'm going to get some
[131.19s -> 136.46s]  good stalling content here. You know, I got to refill this water. So, you know, let me just stall
[136.46s -> 141.02s]  for like another 45 seconds. All right. I've got to tweet it too. Didn't tweet. We're going to do
[141.02s -> 145.94s]  the Hitman 2 DLC. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk for a minute before I go do that.
[146.92s -> 153.16s]  So today is the day before TwitchCon. And some might say that TwitchCon actually starts today.
[154.04s -> 161.00s]  So this is the last stream you're going to see from me until I am back from TwitchCon. A lot
[161.00s -> 168.20s]  of moving around here the last week, the last two weeks of September. So this stream is only going
[168.20s -> 173.00s]  to be a few hours long. We're going to do the Hitman 2 DLC campaigns. I have not done the last
[173.00s -> 179.64s]  one. So we'll see how long that takes. After that, I got to go. There's still a few things
[179.64s -> 186.62s]  that I have to take care of before getting on another plane and leaving for four days.
[186.62s -> 192.78s]  Technically three, right? Whatever it is. But give me one second. I'm going to fill this drink up
[193.42s -> 269.32s]  and then we'll play Hitman 2. Be right back. And I'm going to tweet that. See you in a minute.
[269.32s -> 276.89s]  Yeah, yes, I've seen the new Twitch. I made this reference earlier, but I'm going to make it again.
[276.89s -> 289.58s]  It is the World of Warcraft chat. Especially when you go into all caps. I don't know what
[289.58s -> 297.67s]  the wow chat is. Whatever. I'm of the opinion. Why on earth would you ever under any circumstance?
[297.67s -> 301.11s]  And I'm not talking about Twitch. I'm just saying ever in general. Why are there so many fonts?
[303.75s -> 311.43s]  12 to 14 point Helvetica is the only thing there should be. Why would there ever be another font?
[313.86s -> 320.26s]  Do we need 16, 17, 1800? How many fonts are there? 1800? How many fonts exist?
[322.28s -> 337.35s]  It's probably thousands of them. What's the point? There are millions of fonts. Why is it?
[337.35s -> 345.80s]  There are only three fonts that should exist. Reading things clearly. Birthday card.
[346.60s -> 355.93s]  You can be fun with that one. Birthday card. That's it. I can't think of another reason to
[355.93s -> 364.33s]  ever have another font. There's no other reason for other fonts besides those two.
[367.40s -> 373.30s]  Alright, rip Times New Roman. No, that one doesn't even have to exist either.
[379.54s -> 386.28s]  This should not be more fonts than there are serial brands. Something about that is not correct.
[388.63s -> 393.51s]  They can't even figure out how to make cornflakes fucking 500 times. They've only made it like 30
[393.51s -> 402.31s]  times. How can you? How do you make the letter H look six million times different than the last
[402.31s -> 413.69s]  time you made it? You can't. It's just three lines. It's one, two, three lines. Anyways,
[413.69s -> 419.69s]  before I get all worked up, I'm going to play Hitman now. I have the audio muted so you
[419.69s -> 431.40s]  shouldn't be able to hear it. It shouldn't hurt your ears. Make my own font. It would just be,
[431.48s -> 437.06s]  it would be just a few lines. Wait, you shouldn't be able to hear this.
[437.70s -> 449.18s]  Hold on, not yet. Hold on. Not yet. Now I have to do this fun thing where, oh god, where's my mouse?
[449.74s -> 455.90s]  Why is the window staying open? Close that, please. Don't turn off my computer. Okay, we'll go
[455.90s -> 464.73s]  starting, starting strong here. Okay, here we go. Get that off. Just give me one moment. Nice
[464.73s -> 476.33s]  transition there. I have to get this captured. Let's get it. Do not capture Goose Game. I want
[476.33s -> 484.04s]  Hitman 2 done. There we are. You thought it was going to take me longer. It may have.
[484.92s -> 490.44s]  All right, I got the DLC installed. Hopefully it works. Otherwise, I'm going to be very sad.
[495.14s -> 503.13s]  Stop sweating and turn on face cam. Though, cut my nails though. I did do that. Those of you that
[503.13s -> 511.62s]  were yelling at me last night at the end of that stream, I appreciate it. So this two DLC
[511.62s -> 522.81s]  campaigns, those two missions that I haven't done, right? Campaign, Hitman 2. I did all these
[522.81s -> 535.59s]  already. So golden handshake and the last resort. All right. Remember to shave? Already did. You
[535.59s -> 543.18s]  don't think I was already on top of that? I had to shave to the minute that the Twitch party is
[543.18s -> 549.77s]  going to start on Saturday. I shaved at exactly 7 30 p.m. last night. That's a lie because I was
[549.85s -> 556.23s]  still live. When did the stream end? Like 8 30 p.m. Pacific? That's when the Twitch party starts.
[556.23s -> 562.06s]  It's going to grow out. When I'm in like the Uber to get there, it is going to be perfectly
[562.06s -> 571.45s]  grown out. The last second when I step out of that cab, perfectly grown. So this one is brand new.
[571.45s -> 578.33s]  This one is not. This one is probably like a few months old. By the way, those of you that are
[578.33s -> 585.74s]  going to laugh at me for this, I have not played Hitman since the last time I streamed it. I don't
[585.74s -> 602.82s]  even remember how to play. So that's going to be a thing. Bad, bad. I haven't played it in like a
[602.82s -> 628.98s]  year. I forget what happened. This is a whole game here.
[633.54s -> 634.74s]  Yeah, I'll turn the volume up in a second.
[640.66s -> 642.42s]  I have to pay attention to this, though.
[651.80s -> 656.06s]  That's Troy Baker. That's Troy Baker, right?
[663.40s -> 667.64s]  You can always tell when it's Troy Baker because he elongates words.
[676.65s -> 679.37s]  I'm not nearly as talented as Troy Baker. I'm just telling you.
[683.35s -> 684.07s]  All right, let's go.
[692.79s -> 696.07s]  You don't need to tell us. I'm just telling you.
[696.55s -> 715.59s]  I'm going to pay. Look, I got to pay attention. I can go through the basement, right?
[715.59s -> 726.55s]  Right. So I've got to get three flash drives.
[728.79s -> 733.91s]  And then they combine. I'm going into the basement.
[733.91s -> 750.06s]  Okay, give it to me clear. Break into the vault, get the hard drive rack, and get rid of the director.
[756.14s -> 763.93s]  Okay, break into the hard drive, steal the bank, break into the... All right, break the director,
[764.57s -> 777.80s]  steal the bank, eliminate Athena Savalas. Mission is now active. How do you swing?
[778.52s -> 785.85s]  I think it's a Q. Sound is too low. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hold on.
[795.02s -> 803.53s]  QRS. Okay, objective. Target Athena Savalas, retrieve the data, and exit the bank.
[804.17s -> 812.84s]  I got to get the data. Difficulty professional. That has to change. Wait, no,
[812.84s -> 816.20s]  that's what I played on before, right? Okay, I'm going to be the New Yorker.
[816.20s -> 833.10s]  Don't I have any DLC suits? Why is this taking so long? Should I just go for... All right,
[833.10s -> 839.40s]  I'm going to go into the winter sports suit, I think. I won't look out of place at all.
[840.04s -> 849.61s]  Okay, coin. That's good. My concealed weapon is my ICA-19. That looks all right. Starting location
[849.61s -> 856.34s]  bank entrance. I think I'm ready to go. Pray for my CPU, because the last time I played this game,
[856.34s -> 860.70s]  it was all fucked up. Difficulty master. No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[860.70s -> 865.58s]  Professional. Okay, here we go. And I'm going to turn it up a little bit louder.
[866.30s -> 888.92s]  That should do it. Hey, now you can hear. Let's go. I forget. What's the plan?
[889.96s -> 895.72s]  Welcome to New York, 47. I'll get it again. Milton Fitzpatrick Bank is open for business,
[895.72s -> 900.76s]  but it seems there's some sort of investigation underway. Expect increased security.
[902.41s -> 907.13s]  Your target, Director Athena Savalas, can be found in her top floor office,
[907.13s -> 910.33s]  overlooking the iconic... Stop chugging. What are you talking about?
[910.33s -> 915.61s]  Head of security, Mateo Perez, is roaming between the vault area and the teller hall.
[915.61s -> 920.49s]  What are you talking about? What? And head of accounts, Fabian Mann,
[920.49s -> 924.41s]  can be found on the investment banker floor... What, am I dropping a shitload of frames?
[924.41s -> 926.81s]  ...driving the internal investigation. That shouldn't be happening.
[927.53s -> 930.73s]  Remember, we need to secure the data from the bank's reinforced vault.
[930.73s -> 934.89s]  This is a lie. Or, alternatively, acquire three hard drives...
[934.89s -> 938.65s]  I'm supposed to pay attention to this. ...and two lieutenants, Mann and Perez.
[938.65s -> 940.81s]  Now I lost everything. Good luck, 47.
[941.69s -> 961.14s]  Hold on. Are you guys actually fucking with me? Oh no. Oh no. You weren't. Were you?
[961.94s -> 968.65s]  I have to keep this out. They didn't see this. Oh shit. All right. God damn it.
[969.45s -> 980.60s]  Why does my computer have to suck so bad? All right. What do I... Let me save it.
[984.46s -> 987.96s]  Manual save slot. How about... None of these matter. This one right here.
[990.30s -> 1000.02s]  Okay. Eliminate Athena Savalas and obtain the data. You got it. I need to... I don't remember how to
[1000.02s -> 1019.08s]  play. That's Q. Retrieve vault data core. Three of them. Okay.
[1019.08s -> 1030.97s]  Those of you that are wondering why I did this, I'm making sure my CPU can handle it.
[1031.77s -> 1051.11s]  Okay. I can handle it. Maybe... No, it can't. It can't handle it? It wasn't silky smooth?
[1054.76s -> 1074.90s]  Wait. That wasn't silky smooth? What? God damn it. No! I have to...
[1076.63s -> 1080.63s]  Hold on. Hold on a second. I might have to restart the stream.
[1087.61s -> 1103.06s]  Can I do that during the stream? Hold on a minute. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Damn it. No.
[1104.34s -> 1109.38s]  It's because... I have to restart the stream. All right. I'll be right... I'll be right back.
[1109.38s -> 1119.14s]  It's because when I... Last time I played a console game, I turned my CPU preset down and shit. I'll
[1119.14s -> 1131.46s]  be right back. Like in 10 seconds. All right. We're good. We're good, right? I think we're good.
[1132.54s -> 1149.98s]  Hey. How's everybody doing? Did it work? Confirm with me that this worked. Yes, it did it. Yeah.
[1149.98s -> 1155.90s]  I have my CPU preset so fucking high. So low, I mean. All right. Okay. Hopefully not a thousand
[1155.90s -> 1167.99s]  of you left. You probably did. But now we're silky smooth. We should be. I left. All right.
[1167.99s -> 1172.07s]  Hold on. I got to do this too. Like, I'm sorry guys, but like this is... My computer sucks.
[1173.19s -> 1177.51s]  It really shouldn't suck this much. Do I have to take tech... All right. I'm going to take this
[1177.51s -> 1186.02s]  down to two. I just got this computer. I got a 1080 in here. That's not good anymore, is it?
[1186.02s -> 1194.62s]  Shit. That's not good anymore. That's like not good at all anymore. I have a 4770K. That's good,
[1194.62s -> 1200.14s]  right? No, I don't. What do I have? Somebody do hash... Somebody turn on exclamation point.
[1201.26s -> 1205.34s]  Whatever the... Hold on. The 60... I know what it is. Quiet!
[1219.45s -> 1228.95s]  I'm sorry. Why is this stuttering so much? Have a good day. Okay. Hold on a minute here. Ruby Red,
[1228.95s -> 1234.55s]  famous month-breaking investigative journalist, is in the bank. Known for her fierce skills at
[1234.55s -> 1239.27s]  digging up dirt and her excellent nose for scandal. She's definitely up to something.
[1239.27s -> 1244.55s]  She's up to something. Might be worth following her around the bank, 47. Okay. Let's see where she
[1244.55s -> 1255.64s]  goes. Investigate Ruby Red. All right. Why is that happening now? Teddy, it's me. I'm at the bank now.
[1255.64s -> 1262.66s]  This game fucking hates my computer. Somebody called it too. Don't you dare dump this story,
[1262.66s -> 1269.66s]  Ted. I will find that report. Oh, she's listening. I'm sorry. I'm not interrupting your phone call.
[1269.66s -> 1288.49s]  I'm testing my stream settings. Don't you dare dump this story, Ted. I'm the story of the year.
[1288.49s -> 1294.36s]  Director Ceballos has been at extreme recklessness and the public deserve to know that. My informant
[1294.36s -> 1297.96s]  will come through. Just make sure... I look like such a fucking idiot right now.
[1298.76s -> 1300.44s]  I'm doing v-sync. That's right.
[1304.31s -> 1307.91s]  Okay. Stocks are gonna plummet. They actually fixed everything.
[1315.56s -> 1319.56s]  I'm so out of place. All right. Email the documents. Investigate. I gotta investigate
[1319.56s -> 1321.64s]  the whistleblower. Wait, was that the person she was on the phone with?
[1325.66s -> 1333.56s]  Why were you talking on the phone? I can't get in there. All right. Hold on. I gotta get a suit.
[1333.56s -> 1336.04s]  Yeah, I can't let you pass. I'm sorry, sir. All right. Let me...
[1337.00s -> 1343.99s]  All right. You got a good cop, bad cop routine going. Appreciate it. Wait, I don't want to get on
[1343.99s -> 1357.61s]  camera. All right. Let me see the map. We got a bathroom. Lost and found. All right. Let me...
[1358.65s -> 1364.33s]  I don't know what to do with the bat. I don't know what to do. I need a new... I can't be a guy in...
[1364.33s -> 1375.29s]  I got the corner of my foot touched that. What? Oh, because I picked this up. I picked up...
[1375.29s -> 1383.45s]  How do I put it down? I didn't do that. I had nothing to do with that.
[1385.13s -> 1392.33s]  Look, it's obviously a wet floor. I didn't kill anybody. How do I put this down?
[1399.05s -> 1403.50s]  Hold on. Wait. I can go over here now. This is the security check. I just got it.
[1404.46s -> 1413.99s]  Let's go. Wait. Do I have the door lock on? Unlocker. All right. There's another cop up there,
[1413.99s -> 1447.22s]  though. I got to get the janitor. I got to find somebody. Somebody over there. Where am I? Okay.
[1458.62s -> 1470.68s]  Why do I care more about this in the game? Wait. How do I get to my...
[1471.40s -> 1481.67s]  How do I get to my... I don't know how to get to my inventory. How do I get to the inventory?
[1485.43s -> 1494.49s]  What the fuck was that? Did somebody puke? Who just puked? There's a Q. It's not Q. You want me
[1494.49s -> 1505.11s]  to punch somebody. Which mouse button is it? E. Space. Middle mouse. No, that's gun. R. S.
[1509.29s -> 1525.32s]  I. No, but how do I get the fast one? Tab? V. It's not V. Scroll wheel. It's not scroll wheel.
[1525.88s -> 1540.58s]  Hold on. Mouse and keyboard. Key bindings. Interact. Agility actions. Pick up. Use items G.
[1541.91s -> 1548.87s]  Aim. Shoot. Reload. Instinct. Camera. Shoulder. Crouch. Holster. Precision aim. Zoom in. Zoom out.
[1549.43s -> 1560.38s]  Holster. Inventory. I. Isn't there a spinner? Font change. Am I thinking of a different hitman?
[1566.62s -> 1571.67s]  Okay. So, all right. That's a different hitman. All right. I need to go investigate. I need a
[1571.67s -> 1584.31s]  different clothes. How long does it take for a janitor to come in here? You? Thank you. No.
[1584.31s -> 1614.01s]  It's I too. All right. Just investigating distraction. Who is? I forgot. How stupid this
[1614.01s -> 1627.21s]  game is. Okay. I need to investigate the whistle. I need somebody's outfit. Can I put my back against
[1627.21s -> 1631.69s]  the wall and do like the knock knock solid snake thing? All right. Hold on. Wait. I got an idea.
[1631.69s -> 1643.75s]  Somebody just get the fuck in here. See? I told you. Janitor. Janitor. Janitor. Janitor. Janitor.
[1644.31s -> 1671.40s]  Good to go. Damn. Janitor. Okay. Fresh disguise. What else you got? Coin. Come here. Can I fit
[1671.40s -> 1682.49s]  two people in here? Yeah. We got a raid? Tyler Vic Vicker. Thanks for the raid. Welcome guys.
[1683.21s -> 1687.85s]  Playing Hitman. DLC. I'm trying to relearn how to play the game because I don't know how to play it.
[1688.89s -> 1692.41s]  I do this thing where I don't ever put me on a bicycle because you know like oh once you
[1692.41s -> 1696.09s]  learn how to ride a bike you'll know how to do it forever. No, I won't. If I got on a bike right
[1696.09s -> 1700.33s]  now I learned how to ride a bike when I was like 10. If I got on a bike right now I would fall over.
[1701.05s -> 1712.10s]  All right. So I'm good. I'm the janitor. So now I have to end. What's going on?
[1713.27s -> 1732.30s]  Why is it illegal for the janitor to be up here? God damn it. Why is it? What's wrong with this guy?
[1732.30s -> 1736.46s]  Why does he hate me so much? All right. Wait. There's something else going on.
[1739.74s -> 1740.46s]  What's this story?
[1748.62s -> 1751.18s]  Nerves maybe? Oh wait. Hold on. So the job interview.
[1752.71s -> 1756.86s]  Final applicant was seen going into the bathroom. Yeah. Okay. Where is it?
[1757.74s -> 1770.58s]  Thanks. I want to do that instead. Wait. Can I blend in with a mop? What's this thing?
[1771.38s -> 1790.95s]  There's earphones on this desk. Save. Save it. Save it right here. Manual save. Hey stop this
[1790.95s -> 1801.48s]  ridiculous behavior at once. I'm sorry. I just want the earphones. I got them. Free earphones.
[1801.48s -> 1803.64s]  All right. Let's go back to the guy that's thrown up here.
[1812.15s -> 1822.68s]  Where is this? Wait. He was in here? Oh I have to. The door is locked. Oh I get it. Okay.
[1824.04s -> 1843.51s]  How do I knock on the door? Is he going to come out? I got to be ready for him when he comes out.
[1846.97s -> 1855.80s]  When he comes out. Should I? Is this the exit? How do I get in there?
[1859.70s -> 1861.94s]  Oh this is still flooding. Is there a way to? Wait.
[1872.89s -> 1875.93s]  I need to get in this bathroom. Oh this is bad. I don't want to do that.
[1879.93s -> 1888.41s]  I'm fucking ruining this bathroom. Is anybody in here? Knock knock.
[1889.05s -> 1897.11s]  I need to unlock this door. Doesn't the janitor have every single key?
[1897.75s -> 1906.97s]  I thought that was the thing. Shoot him through the door and then I would never get in.
[1906.97s -> 1922.74s]  No. I need a I need a key. Like a security. I need a security key. I'm kind of just collecting
[1922.74s -> 1930.55s]  stuff. All right. Wait. Hold on. Soda can. Nice. Okay. This is not Skyrim. I don't know why I'm
[1930.55s -> 1933.59s]  picking up all this useless shit. Could I take this guy's coffee when he puts it down?
[1934.39s -> 1946.38s]  I'm waiting. All right. I need that guy right there. I need a new outfit. I have to get in that
[1946.38s -> 1978.79s]  room. Can I open the door with the crowbar? I'll try it. Don't you dare.
[1981.45s -> 1985.82s]  I have too much stuff. I got to disguise as the applicant. Does he have a key card?
[1986.46s -> 1999.13s]  I'm gonna get um. Is there enough room in here? Put his face in the toilet. You guys are fucked
[1999.13s -> 2017.75s]  up. Look at the toilet. T.O.S. I'm just gonna turn this off. I don't need it anymore.
[2018.31s -> 2030.46s]  All right. I now approach the reception. I'm the applicant for the work for the job.
[2032.57s -> 2043.53s]  That's the target up there. I'm like to the interview. Feeling better I hope.
[2043.53s -> 2050.49s]  Should I let HR know you're ready for the final interview? Yes. I feel like a new man. I'm ready.
[2050.49s -> 2059.32s]  Wonderful. Follow me please. It's right down here. Best of luck in your interview 47.
[2059.40s -> 2069.13s]  I thought that was her. All right. Follow you. I hate when they do this shit in MMOs.
[2070.09s -> 2073.37s]  I don't want to walk faster than the NPC. I want to walk with the NPC.
[2075.45s -> 2080.04s]  Like why is there no match speed? This is the interview.
[2088.73s -> 2095.96s]  I bring my lucky wrench to interviews apparently. Mr. Thomas. Okay. Let's sit down.
[2101.24s -> 2101.56s]  Cool.
[2113.80s -> 2116.44s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can we do the interview still?
[2118.89s -> 2129.05s]  Did I get the job? Did I get the job? Oh shit. Okay. Oh my god.
[2129.05s -> 2156.41s]  I'm just doing my job. That's all. How is somebody not figuring this out?
[2156.97s -> 2190.01s]  Wait. Let's go. Like you'll ever get me. These games are fucking so funny.
[2190.01s -> 2194.33s]  Best of luck in your interview 47. Let's see where this will lead you to.
[2194.33s -> 2202.47s]  All right. I'm going to get stuck here I think. I don't want to get seen by the camera.
[2207.00s -> 2216.09s]  Shh. God damn it. I got seen. Press alt. Why? Alt?
[2221.80s -> 2223.00s]  Okay. I'm ready for the interview.
[2229.48s -> 2229.80s]  Oh.
[2238.84s -> 2239.80s]  Personality test.
[2240.36s -> 2244.12s]  Kick this off. Okay. I'm ready. Okay. So this is a very simple test.
[2244.68s -> 2247.88s]  All you do is pick a card and tell us what you see there.
[2247.88s -> 2250.92s]  Now it's important to point out that there are no right or wrong answers.
[2250.92s -> 2255.32s]  Clearly me. It's just to give us a better impression of who you are on a psychological level.
[2255.96s -> 2258.28s]  Does that make sense? Why would they be doing this?
[2258.28s -> 2263.08s]  All right. Mr. Thomas. Did you see my resume? If you will please pick the card.
[2263.08s -> 2267.40s]  I want the brown university. God damn it. Opportunity. Opportunity.
[2269.75s -> 2277.14s]  Now here's the fucking 500 IQ play. You know, the Forbes magazine over there.
[2277.86s -> 2281.10s]  They're going to be like, wait a minute. That wasn't part of the plan.
[2283.50s -> 2291.59s]  Oh, I understand. He went completely out of the box. Opportunity. I don't know. This one.
[2292.15s -> 2297.93s]  No, this one. This one. All right. Now look at it closely. Take a few moments.
[2298.65s -> 2306.01s]  Then tell me, do you see an animal or an object? It's clearly a bird. I see. What kind of animal? An eagle bird.
[2306.73s -> 2313.66s]  An eagle perhaps. Eagle. Very interesting. A forceful animal. Anything else? It's
[2314.70s -> 2322.70s]  feeding on something. Feeding on what? A carcass. The scene is reflected in a pool of blood
[2322.70s -> 2328.14s]  flowing from the body. Okay. It's a vulture feeding on someone else's kill.
[2328.30s -> 2336.68s]  This is for a bank clerk job? Mr. Thomas. Yes. Brutal even. Right. Very interesting observation,
[2336.68s -> 2343.24s]  Mr. Thomas. Not what we expected, but that's perfectly fine. Let's take the next one, shall
[2343.24s -> 2348.84s]  we? The next one. Pick any of the remaining cards that make you think of execution, please.
[2349.56s -> 2354.68s]  I mean, it obviously is going to be the one with the Hitman 47 with his two pistols,
[2354.84s -> 2360.30s]  but this could also be one. I'm not going to go for the easy one.
[2360.30s -> 2367.72s]  Oh, very good. This is an interesting one. What do you see here? Take in the whole image, please.
[2367.72s -> 2373.96s]  And in as much detail as possible. It's a river. It's a river with rocks all around it. Or it's
[2373.96s -> 2381.19s]  a stone head. I see a big pile of money earned performing questionable actions.
[2381.19s -> 2385.75s]  And how do you feel about that? I'm trying to just completely bomb this interview.
[2386.47s -> 2392.55s]  Very good, Mr. Thomas. Well, that's a very creative interpretation, Mr. Thomas.
[2393.19s -> 2396.79s]  I think we've just got time for the last card. Please proceed.
[2397.51s -> 2401.03s]  This last card should hopefully make you think of prosperity.
[2405.19s -> 2410.78s]  So my experience in the banking world, I was a teller at Bank of America for four years.
[2411.42s -> 2415.67s]  I've handled money for a lot. You don't care about that?
[2415.75s -> 2422.68s]  Whenever you're ready. Okay, sure. I'll pick the card. I'll pick this one.
[2422.68s -> 2426.28s]  Good choice. Tell me, what is the first thing you've seen?
[2426.28s -> 2434.04s]  I've also been I've handled gold before and figure in a large coat. Perspective skewed
[2434.04s -> 2442.23s]  as if I'm looking at him from the ground. He's got something in his hands. I go on. He's on
[2442.23s -> 2449.35s]  dual firearms, large caliber pistols. I see. What else do you see? He's just finished a job
[2449.35s -> 2456.95s]  perfectly executed. And who is this man? It's me. Very, very interesting, Mr. Thomas.
[2456.95s -> 2463.51s]  Well, that was certainly unexpected. I think the results are pretty clear. Did I get it?
[2463.51s -> 2469.75s]  We don't have the perfect match for the investment banker position. However, you're just the man we
[2469.75s -> 2474.55s]  need for our accounting department. I have to agree with Kevin here. We need someone a little
[2474.55s -> 2481.51s]  more cutthroat for the top tier here. This is when they lean in and wink. It's really dive into
[2481.51s -> 2487.99s]  character as it were. But on a positive note, I want you to wink wink. I want you to beat the
[2487.99s -> 2492.95s]  shit out of people I don't like. Great point, Melissa. There's no need to turn this little
[2492.95s -> 2498.15s]  setback into a complete failure. Someone with your particular set of skills would be perfect.
[2498.15s -> 2501.91s]  I'll take it. When do I start? Well, aren't you an eager beaver?
[2502.63s -> 2506.23s]  Well, we expect you to come in tomorrow at eight. Welcome on board, Mr. Thomas.
[2507.51s -> 2523.85s]  Oh, I got it. Oh, I did it all correct. I didn't even mean to. I did it. Now what? They're both
[2523.85s -> 2535.06s]  just leaving their office? Okay, bye. Time to rifle through your desk. Okay, cool. Close this
[2535.06s -> 2540.94s]  shit. Turn the lights off too. Let's make it atmospheric. No, close. Okay, quickly. What do
[2540.94s -> 2547.02s]  I got? Coffee. We got something in your desk. Your computer. Hack his computer. Take his pen.
[2547.02s -> 2553.37s]  What should I do here? What should I do? It's a bust of his head, I think. Okay.
[2554.82s -> 2562.87s]  Nothing else. Well, I got the job. What are you talking about? I got the job.
[2563.51s -> 2577.29s]  Restart. What? I got the... Didn't I get the job? They gave me the wrong job. That's a win, man.
[2578.09s -> 2594.15s]  It was me. It was me.
[2602.95s -> 2605.27s]  Wait, hold on. Are they... I thought they were going to...
[2623.59s -> 2633.77s]  All right, so I did it wrong? That's too... That's too... I saved over it. No? Okay, right here.
[2634.33s -> 2649.29s]  There's an auto save that saved me. Tell me what this reminds you of.
[2649.29s -> 2664.68s]  Okay. No, wait. I can't... I screwed it up, guys. I saved over. I thought I got the job. I thought
[2664.68s -> 2681.82s]  I got a job. I thought I got a job. I didn't get the job. I got a job. Go further back? But then I
[2681.82s -> 2692.23s]  look at how far back this is. I'm gonna get distracted. All right, I'll try. I'll try. I'm
[2692.23s -> 2703.94s]  gonna try it. I'm gonna go very... I'm gonna go very, very fast. Oh, god. I need another... Okay,
[2703.94s -> 2710.86s]  I need the bathroom. I need crowbar. I need bathroom. I don't even... I don't remember... I
[2710.86s -> 2721.70s]  don't remember how I got in there. I gotta watch out, though. All right. Well, let's go down here.
[2724.14s -> 2739.72s]  Make the guy fall again. I can't just relive the whole thing. What is this? No. I'm too stressed.
[2740.60s -> 2763.69s]  I'm not stressed. What are you talking about? These guys have guns. I'm getting inside my own...
[2763.69s -> 2777.03s]  Where's the bathroom here? All right. This guy right here. Bathroom. You're not allowed to go
[2777.03s -> 2796.22s]  in there, right? You're allowed to go... Is this like public space? No. Okay. What? It's a zoo?
[2796.78s -> 2800.94s]  All right. This way. I need to find the... There we go. Wet floor sign. This is the part I remember.
[2805.77s -> 2817.26s]  It's gonna happen. Here it comes. She absorbed all the water. She absorbed the water.
[2823.11s -> 2829.61s]  She must be so... She's just like... She's soaking.
[2830.90s -> 2833.86s]  Not why they're looking for me. I told you this wasn't gonna work.
[2834.66s -> 2847.80s]  Create a water leak. All right. What about over here?
[2853.54s -> 2861.90s]  There's the janitor. Money out of the ATM? Hold on. Is this like free money?
[2862.70s -> 2876.74s]  Why is it a slot machine? You just gotta know what you're doing. That's all.
[2877.30s -> 2895.93s]  Yes. That guy said yes. It is a slot machine. Okay. Here we go. What's up? Shit. Get out of here.
[2897.88s -> 2902.97s]  It's in the house. Come on. I need this guy's costume.
[2904.90s -> 2923.99s]  If she's here, we are all in big trouble. You sink? I mean... No. No. You.
[2927.03s -> 2965.59s]  I peeked out. That was me. All right. Janitor key. Holy shit. I got the janitor key.
[2966.31s -> 2974.18s]  All right. I'm good. That guy left. Have a great day.
[2974.82s -> 2996.65s]  Okay. I need to save the game here. No. Didn't wash hands. Okay. So now
[2997.29s -> 3010.73s]  I'm going up here. That guy can see. Can I walk into this? I have the janitor key. This is fine.
[3011.94s -> 3020.20s]  No, it's not. I'm not allowed in there. I'm a security guard. Why would I not be allowed
[3020.20s -> 3038.92s]  over there? All right. Hold on. There's like a wardrobe this way. I'm going a completely
[3038.92s -> 3046.25s]  different way than I went last time. All right. Hold on. What is that? I want that. Whatever it
[3046.25s -> 3056.15s]  is. Give it to me. Propane flask. I don't want this actually. No. I have to put this down.
[3056.71s -> 3065.22s]  I just showed it to him. I just showed it to him.
[3077.30s -> 3078.50s]  All right. I have to reload.
[3084.74s -> 3104.66s]  That activates it? Wait. What? I forgot how much fun this game was.
[3109.48s -> 3118.14s]  All right. Let's go. I got to go this way. Up the stairs. Just avoid the random police
[3118.14s -> 3128.44s]  officers that are going to be staring at me. Just run by. Made it. Kind of. What's with this cube?
[3129.24s -> 3140.09s]  Hold on. What's the cube? I need to know what's in the cube. What? Okay. All right. I'm not going
[3140.09s -> 3155.53s]  to fail the interview this time. Wait. This is something new. Wait. This is the whistleblower.
[3158.65s -> 3168.17s]  I hit a bit of an obstacle here. No. Nobody's discovered anything, but for some reason,
[3168.17s -> 3174.33s]  the security is super high. So that's why he's fired? I don't think I can get to the documents
[3174.33s -> 3182.20s]  safely. There's some sort of investigation going on. We kind of want to be left alone.
[3182.20s -> 3190.84s]  Okay. Fine. Do you mind? Fine. He's discovered anything, but for some reason, the security is
[3190.84s -> 3199.29s]  super high today. I don't think I can get to the documents safely. There's some sort of investigation
[3199.29s -> 3208.94s]  going on, and they're specifically looking for the file. I hit the file in a safety deposit box in
[3208.94s -> 3219.10s]  the basement. Keys were on the desk. This whistleblowing thing sounds great on paper,
[3219.10s -> 3230.94s]  but I am telling you, it's pretty damn terrifying. Let me save it here. Locate the deposit box key.
[3232.81s -> 3250.76s]  All right. Where is that? That way. All right. Can I scan my ass? I'm sorry. Don't mind me.
[3258.74s -> 3286.22s]  Do you have anything on you? Nothing? Apple. All right. I got to go to... Wait. Rat poison. Get it.
[3289.13s -> 3306.14s]  All right. Locate the safety deposit box key, which is this way. I'm not allowed in there though.
[3307.61s -> 3312.97s]  Hmm. That's the head of security here. Mateo Perez. Who? He'll be holding one of the three
[3312.97s -> 3327.90s]  backup data disks. Who? This guy right here? This person right here? That's the only person
[3327.90s -> 3365.82s]  that's here. That's the first backup data disk secured. Two more to locate. Shit.
[3379.88s -> 3388.36s]  Somebody has to come help. I have to make my escape. My fingerprints are all over that, right?
[3389.24s -> 3392.84s]  Yeah. Look at it. I don't even wear gloves. My fingerprints are... Oh, no. I don't even
[3392.84s -> 3399.88s]  not have fingerprints. Nobody comes over here, right? Okay. I'm good. Let's go. Can I get the
[3399.88s -> 3408.07s]  knife? Oh, that's disgusting. Okay. Give me the apple. I was never here. Wait. Can I dress as
[3408.07s -> 3412.47s]  this person? Nope. Okay. Hold on. I got the safety deposit box key. I got to go
[3413.11s -> 3429.83s]  up here. I'm freaking out. Okay. Save the game in a different spot. Okay. Wait. I have bloody
[3429.83s -> 3448.50s]  footprints? No, I don't. Who is looking at me? What is this? Turn on frosted glass?
[3450.42s -> 3457.26s]  Oh, nice. This is a little safe area. All right. I gotta keep that. I gotta remind myself to come
[3457.26s -> 3471.16s]  in here. So, I gotta get in there and get the key. I'm allowed in here. There's only one person's
[3471.16s -> 3501.66s]  person at the desk over there. I can get it. Shit. Is anybody else in here? No. Don't poison the
[3501.66s -> 3516.02s]  water bottle. What am I doing? Okay. The key is... Where is it? Nothing. All right. Looking for the
[3516.02s -> 3549.46s]  desk. Looking for the key. Wait. Is it in there? It's not one of these desks. Got it. Holding
[3549.46s -> 3571.64s]  ear pods. I'm gonna save it here. No. A new one. Can I take a bite out of this? All right. Time to
[3571.64s -> 3577.40s]  go to the... I gotta go down to the basement. Now, how am I gonna get down to the basement?
[3577.40s -> 3587.98s]  I have to go all the way down here, I think. But will these guys try to stop me? No one's found
[3587.98s -> 3597.40s]  this yet. That's good. I gotta get down here. These guys will let me through, right? Good afternoon,
[3597.40s -> 3611.77s]  sir. All right. It's in there. This is the vault, 47. The data core should be behind that large
[3611.77s -> 3618.63s]  steel door. Looking for the data core. All right. Incriminating evidence. Well, at least it's not as
[3618.63s -> 3625.83s]  bad as that time in Queens. Remember that? The 6,000 semi-incinerated files we had to tape together?
[3625.83s -> 3633.03s]  Don't remind me. I'm just saying, maybe this isn't so terrible after all. There are always worse
[3633.03s -> 3641.11s]  cases out there. I guess I mostly... Got it. ...to staff or ask around if people have seen a folder
[3641.11s -> 3648.23s]  full of secrets. We could be here weeks and not find anything. Any money in here? You don't have
[3648.23s -> 3666.23s]  to love it. Yeah, I guess you're right. Oh, shit. There is money. There's a money key. All right. I
[3666.23s -> 3693.75s]  got the money key. Now I have to fuck with this guy for a minute. He was gonna call something in,
[3693.75s -> 3697.83s]  but he just got embarrassed. I think he thought he fell off the chair. Hey, this is... Oh, wait a
[3697.83s -> 3716.30s]  minute. I was just sleeping. Never mind. Everything's fine. Right before he dozes off. All right. He's
[3716.30s -> 3729.64s]  just dozed off. There it is. You know when you're right about to fall asleep, you get ripped out of
[3730.20s -> 3733.62s]  it. He's gonna go back to bed in front of these guys.
[3738.92s -> 3752.97s]  How could you go back to sleep? Ready? He hit his head pretty hard. I got plenty of shit to throw at
[3752.97s -> 3778.36s]  you. Wait, I think the net... No. Whatevs. If his mouth opens, can I get it right in his mouth?
[3786.63s -> 3810.52s]  Ah, there we go. Now he wants to investigate. What did he just take? Ready? One, two, three.
[3811.72s -> 3819.91s]  Aha. Okay. This is where we end up. There's some kind of fracas down here. I'm having a look around.
[3819.91s -> 3863.10s]  This is gonna be so horrible. Hey. Right when he goes to bed. Oh. He's up. Let's put him up.
[3863.10s -> 3881.02s]  Okay. Hold on. Will he remember this? I'm trying to sit him back in the chair. This is not even
[3881.02s -> 3885.38s]  that bad. Everybody knows this guy sleeps on the job anyways. All right. I need to pick up all the
[3885.38s -> 3898.58s]  things I threw. Okay. That's everything I had, right? Unconscious witness. I'm gonna be an
[3898.58s -> 3912.17s]  unconscious witness. Wait. He saw my face. I can't, like, dump rat poison down his throat.
[3912.81s -> 3916.17s]  All right. That's fucked up. I can't. I just said that out loud. All right. He'll be fine.
[3916.73s -> 3930.62s]  I was trying to, like, plant the ear pods on him. All right. Whatever. He'll be up for a while.
[3931.26s -> 3956.30s]  I gotta go to Ruby Red. How has nobody found you yet? Reload. Oh, that's right. I did. I saved it
[3956.30s -> 3969.72s]  right before I did all that. You're right. The blood has been cleaned up. All right. Let's go.
[3978.18s -> 3982.42s]  Should I be actually working with Ruby Red? I'm gonna get double crossed here. That's what
[3982.42s -> 3989.45s]  happens in these games. Now the blood is there this time. All right. I got files. What are you?
[3989.45s -> 3999.72s]  What's in it for me? How are you? Hmm. It is.
[4013.51s -> 4019.27s]  Sounds like Miss Red has quite a scoop on her hands. Yeah. My guess is this will cause a major
[4019.27s -> 4034.42s]  market upset. No, no, no. No photos of me. All right. We need the other data disks. Got it.
[4036.78s -> 4042.89s]  Data disk objective is there's one down here. There's a data core. All right. Let me go down
[4042.89s -> 4050.26s]  here. What was the other thing that I had? I had some more intel. No, it was objectives.
[4050.98s -> 4059.02s]  No, it was intel, wasn't it? I already got this one. The whistleblower got that one.
[4061.67s -> 4064.87s]  Okay. I got, I need one more. There's another one down this way. Let's go here.
[4067.00s -> 4073.30s]  I need to get the job. All right. I'll get the job. Where's the guy that's puking?
[4075.80s -> 4095.64s]  Insider trading. What? Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4095.64s -> 4100.28s]  No, drop, drop, drop, drop down, drop down, drop down. How do I drop down? How do I drop?
[4101.08s -> 4126.28s]  How do you drop down? I can't just let go. Stock is crashing. Wait, what? Where? I need to,
[4126.28s -> 4145.14s]  where's the stock? Where are the stocks crashing? Where's the puke? Where's the guy that's throwing
[4145.14s -> 4163.11s]  up in the bathroom? I don't see him anywhere. Wasn't he supposed to be in here? Oh, the other
[4163.11s -> 4188.62s]  side. Oh, fuck. Second floor. Right. Oh, God damn it. The guy with the machine gun. All right. All
[4188.62s -> 4196.92s]  right. I'm surrendering. I'm surrendering. You gotta be kidding. Just a little bit closer.
[4199.26s -> 4218.71s]  What? It's not, it's not a wet floor. Somebody. All right. Well, what was it over here? Second
[4218.71s -> 4232.97s]  floor in the second bathroom. Kind of, I gotta be a gamer. I can handle it. Don't worry. I can
[4232.97s -> 4242.18s]  handle it. I didn't save after this, but it's all right. I'm just going to run up there.
[4245.75s -> 4255.86s]  Straight, left, right, up, skip. Don't step in the blood and get it all over me.
[4259.98s -> 4266.65s]  There you go. I got something for you. Is that, is that what I think it is? Uh-huh. Yes.
[4267.45s -> 4275.27s]  Just make sure the information will be put to good use. Oh, you can bank on that for you. What's
[4275.27s -> 4281.19s]  your role in this? I'm not important. Good luck. It sounds like Miss Red has quite a scoop on her
[4281.19s -> 4287.11s]  hands. My guess is this will cause a major market upset, which is sure to bring the director out
[4287.11s -> 4290.31s]  from her fortified office. Oh, it's as if she comes out. All right. Here we go.
[4291.35s -> 4295.56s]  Going through bathroom time. Look if a guy in the bathroom.
[4299.05s -> 4311.78s]  Save game. Go get, go play the stock market before everything crashes. All right. So then where was
[4311.78s -> 4317.18s]  the bathroom? Am I in the wrong fucking place? I thought I was supposed to go up and then right.
[4317.82s -> 4338.41s]  Isn't that like where I am? Go by. I'm up, I think I'm up way too high. All right. I gotta be careful
[4338.41s -> 4358.98s]  here. He's not in here. It's the other side. Oh, fuck. What? What are you up to? Who are you?
[4363.06s -> 4377.02s]  You, you're starting to piss me off. Hey, I know you can hear me. I'm talking. Who the fuck is this
[4377.02s -> 4391.18s]  guy? Oh man. No, no, no, no, not the gun. Um, fuck. Jesus. Thank Christ. How did you get up?
[4392.06s -> 4428.18s]  God, come on. It's a fucking three stooges episode. Oh, it was the other side. Shit. All right. I'm
[4428.18s -> 4450.39s]  back. Everybody has the little dollop on their head here. It's not this bathroom this way. Wait a
[4450.39s -> 4460.12s]  minute. I don't have a crowbar. Whatever. All right. I'm gonna save right here. You very clearly don't
[4460.12s -> 4472.89s]  work here. Oh, this is the stock area. Trespassing. Get a note. I'm trespassing. It's okay. I got the
[4472.89s -> 4477.66s]  note. What is it? Intel. Notice from the bank's head of security mentions that recent issues with
[4477.66s -> 4483.18s]  the building's wireless internet have gotten director Sal Vallas so high strung that fixing
[4483.18s -> 4489.26s]  the wifi in her office always takes priority. If the wifi in the director's office breaks down,
[4489.26s -> 4495.70s]  IT is allowed full and immediate access to the area. No questions asked. Okay. I gotta get,
[4495.70s -> 4518.15s]  I gotta be an IT guy. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me. Is this an IT guy?
[4518.79s -> 4522.68s]  I don't know. Don't they, they wait to highs and shit, right? Investment banker.
[4522.68s -> 4541.34s]  You have anything else? Holy shit. Wait a minute. The guy's doing coke. Wait, what? Hold on a second.
[4550.02s -> 4554.02s]  I want him to wake up and then do coke naked and die.
[4563.43s -> 4565.51s]  Can you, how do you wake somebody up?
[4565.51s -> 4572.98s]  Get up. If I make a loud noise, will he get up? Can I give his clothes back?
[4588.41s -> 4602.42s]  The guards wake him up. Okay. Reload and poison coke. How am I going to do that? He's just going
[4602.42s -> 4617.99s]  to be staring at me. Hold on. Just dump poison on it while he smokes. Okay. It's this way.
[4618.71s -> 4625.13s]  He comes into this bathroom. Is it just here? He just, who just has coke just sitting here?
[4625.85s -> 4645.40s]  What? This is just community coke. Hey, uh, who are you? I'm sorry. It's all yours.
[4647.99s -> 4666.15s]  Answer me when I'm talking to you. Identify yourself. Oh, the veins are popping. Some
[4666.15s -> 4672.78s]  psycho's trying to kill people. He's got his hands around someone's neck. Hey, please, I need help.
[4673.58s -> 4698.73s]  I was behind the door. How would you see that? All right. I gotta go faster. Okay. Then I'm
[4698.73s -> 4725.45s]  going to go in behind him. Wait, can I hide in this? Yes. God damn it. I just want to watch you do
[4725.45s -> 4778.36s]  coke and die. What happened? He didn't do anything. Is he just sick because he's sick? He's still sick
[4778.36s -> 4809.08s]  though. He's ready to fight. Jesus Christ. That guy was the problem. I thought it was me. That
[4809.08s -> 4829.72s]  guy was the problem. That's so funny. I'm sitting here so concerned that they're chasing me.
[4830.68s -> 4834.20s]  Okay. I'm only doing this one more time and then I have to, I have to do something else.
[4848.01s -> 4856.50s]  Can you do the coke? No. You got to get him sick and then high and then him running around outside.
[4857.06s -> 4883.16s]  Right. Okay. I'll go for it. I don't feel so good. Where are the bathrooms?
[4891.54s -> 4893.86s]  He doesn't know where the bathroom is.
[4900.28s -> 4901.72s]  Why would you puke in there?
[4902.44s -> 4912.87s]  Wait, wait, wait. Give me that wristwatch. Don't mind me. I'm just going to turn on the water.
[4912.87s -> 4921.03s]  Help me out a little bit. Wait, hold on. He's not going to slip in that, is he?
[4921.03s -> 4940.63s]  I'm just making it worse. All right. Here. Now. I just broke his watch.
[4940.63s -> 4972.28s]  Give me the watch back. I have to bring people over here. What? What was he doing?
[4973.70s -> 4979.70s]  Is he wiping? Is he washing his hands in the water on the ground? This guy is fucking high.
[5021.98s -> 5057.03s]  Look at this guy. He's doing something wrong. He's not. He's not going to go back. No, is he?
[5057.03s -> 5074.98s]  It's high. All right. I've had my fun. Is he the only one that comes in here? I have to get him
[5074.98s -> 5087.30s]  high and then hit him with muffins. Give me that watch. All right. Time for objective. I don't. Oh
[5087.30s -> 5098.25s]  God. Here he comes again. Oh shit. Don't turn. Is it still poisoned? He's not going to do it again,
[5098.25s -> 5122.49s]  right? He just did it. All right. Muffin time. And then I'm going to fucking just let him run out.
[5122.49s -> 5172.60s]  Okay. Get out there. Run out there and cause a problem. Oh my God. He doesn't. I don't know you.
[5194.17s -> 5229.18s]  Is this real or are you just high? Imagine opening the door and the security guy would
[5229.82s -> 5234.94s]  fucking apples at a guy who is lying on the ground. Holy shit. He's looking at the blood.
[5235.50s -> 5284.73s]  This is bad. This is really bad. Holy shit, man. Okay. I'm ready. I still got the tie in the same
[5284.73s -> 5291.35s]  spot that he had his tie. Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait
[5291.35s -> 5302.38s]  a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, they're above. I have the Coke tie on right now. Okay. So I'm safe. I'm
[5302.38s -> 5320.15s]  going to save it by the way. Right here. I got to get to the IT room. Key card. Do I have, can I do
[5323.05s -> 5331.08s]  card reader? Okay. I don't know. I don't know where I'm going. I've got, I'm going up restricted
[5331.08s -> 5360.57s]  area, unauthorized accesses. Okay. So I'm guessing going up. I'm going up here. Okay. I love that.
[5360.57s -> 5370.78s]  You can, you can save scum in this game. It's so wonderful. Milton Fitzpatrick,
[5373.38s -> 5403.54s]  IT. Oh, I'm supposed to be up here. Right. I'm an investment banker. Ooh, coffee. I don't have any
[5403.54s -> 5417.22s]  poison in the office in plain sight. I'm sorry. There's a guy that can see through my disguise
[5417.22s -> 5425.82s]  here. Mr. Man, we've been reviewing for just a few hours. It's not quite enough to get through
[5425.82s -> 5430.94s]  the substantial amount of documentation here. You're supposed to be the best. I was told
[5432.90s -> 5438.26s]  Mr. Man Kruger and Schultz has won best internal auditing awards. Nine years in a row. We are the
[5438.26s -> 5444.42s]  best, but we cannot buy low, sell high. I'll put my hand down now. Don't worry. You're pretty
[5444.42s -> 5461.21s]  little head of shit. This guy's got a disc. I'm feeling pretty salty here, lady. Pizza. All right.
[5465.16s -> 5469.96s]  I swear those people in IT need to get off their asses. You used all the right software on my laptop.
[5469.96s -> 5480.78s]  All right. Where's IT? Oh, that is Athena Savalas, billionaire banker,
[5480.78s -> 5511.77s]  Providence Herald, and Bane of the middle class. Push her out the window quick. Get her out the
[5511.77s -> 5545.34s]  window. Do it. I died with an apple in my hand. I need that guy's disc. He's got like, he's a,
[5545.34s -> 5551.90s]  he used to go do like a colonic. No, I'm sorry. She can't take any calls right now. I suggest
[5551.90s -> 5572.92s]  you call back later. Sir, are you with the... What the fuck is this? An iron, I guess.
[5617.35s -> 5660.95s]  I gotta, I gotta stick with it. I haven't killed anybody. Last ditch. Where is she going?
[5663.30s -> 5675.96s]  What the fuck was that? Oh, she's got, she's, she's got like a bunch of like
[5676.52s -> 5682.81s]  people watching the stream. She's got four pocket medics. Take the principal to the safe location.
[5684.10s -> 5716.22s]  No! Close the door on me. All right. I'm getting in there. No more fucking around. Distract guy at
[5716.22s -> 5734.90s]  desk. Easy. Stay here and try not to get in my way. Okay, but be careful. No, you need to both be
[5734.90s -> 5777.34s]  over there. Oh, come on. The alarm. Say what? Don't have a fuck with Coke tie. What's this? Oh, I need
[5777.34s -> 5783.48s]  that. Apple we got. Okay. So now I gotta get in there. I gotta get to IT.
[5784.28s -> 5793.22s]  Do they labeled? Conference room, director's office. I need IT. Level two, level one,
[5795.16s -> 5809.38s]  level zero, teller hall, level minus one. Where's the IT office? Security hub, interview, VIP,
[5809.38s -> 5818.73s]  waiting lounge. Where's, there's no IT. Deposit boxes all the way down in the basement.
[5820.55s -> 5828.62s]  All right. I got a, I got all the way up here though. I have the key. I need to get a different
[5828.62s -> 5845.32s]  disguise. This is going to beep and all right. This is good. This shit in here that I can do.
[5845.32s -> 5854.22s]  All right. Apricot. That's a smaller, more dense, compact apple. So that's good. That's good for me.
[5854.86s -> 5886.82s]  Create water leak now. Clothes, iron. It's like a net gear. Does she just come and try to unplug it
[5886.82s -> 5899.11s]  and plug it back in? Nope. She's going to figure it out. What'd she do though? She demands an IT
[5899.11s -> 5933.46s]  person. Where'd he go? Somebody get IT up. Yeah. All right. Where's the IT guy? Get IT. We need Tim,
[5933.46s -> 5961.45s]  the IT guy. All right. I gotta get the hell out of here. Tim, the IT guy. Gotta go down. Have you
[5961.45s -> 5968.66s]  tried turning it on and turning it off again? She's asked for her assistant to get someone from IT
[5968.66s -> 5971.22s]  to come up and look at it. This would be an excellent way to get close to the director.
[5972.10s -> 5979.86s]  I have to get down to IT and get a costume. Where am I now? Down. I gotta go down from here.
[5980.66s -> 6013.59s]  Is he already up there? A guy on a computer up there. So which way does he have to go? No,
[6013.59s -> 6021.38s]  that's not a guy on a computer. Is he gonna come up these stairs? He has to come up these stairs.
[6021.38s -> 6054.50s]  All right. So where is he? Fix the router. Let's go. It's gonna take a while to get up here.
[6054.50s -> 6074.49s]  Are you guys sure somebody's gonna come up into this room? I think they were on the way up and
[6074.49s -> 6078.09s]  I think they just found the body. That's the IT guy that's on the way up.
[6086.79s -> 6094.33s]  I have to get back down there. Oh no, the IT guy found him. That's great. Oh my god.
[6100.46s -> 6103.58s]  Why is the IT guy? It's always the IT department. They just do everything.
[6104.44s -> 6118.36s]  They figure everything out. They don't get enough credit. I wonder how long I have to sit here for
[6118.36s -> 6128.58s]  though. At what point does unplugging and plugging back in the router take precedence over dead guy
[6128.58s -> 6147.83s]  with knife and head on the stairs? I don't know. We're gonna find out. Still searching. What is
[6147.83s -> 6170.39s]  that down there? I have to go meet him down there. I do. Where did I save at last? I think I have to
[6170.39s -> 6174.87s]  just run down to where that guy's dead and intercept him and leave two dead bodies there.
[6176.95s -> 6196.58s]  You know what I'm saying? That's the play. Okay. I've got to get down to where that is.
[6197.54s -> 6219.35s]  All right. Get down there quick. Where is it? Where is it? Oh shit. Where is it? Is that?
[6219.99s -> 6240.01s]  Get out of my way. Fuck. God damn it. It's that guy. No, I can't. You gotta get ready. What a
[6240.01s -> 6262.78s]  fucking idiot. Where is he? All right. Out into the right. Down the stairs. Go. Go. Okay. Okay.
[6262.78s -> 6265.10s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Down here.
[6266.23s -> 6283.80s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. IT guy. Where is he? That's him I think. Right there.
[6298.55s -> 6312.55s]  Who? What? What? Who found it? Oh, fuck. There he is. I gotta save right now. Over,
[6312.55s -> 6320.81s]  over here. It's Ruby Red. Get out of here. Ruby Red. We're on the same team.
[6325.11s -> 6337.13s]  Ruby Red. Get out of the way. Ruby. I'm sorry. No, Ruby. God damn it. I'm sorry. I have to.
[6340.81s -> 6363.19s]  Ruby's gonna have to get hit in the head with an apple. She'll be fine. No, no. Why are you
[6363.19s -> 6377.03s]  not knocked out? No. I'm like a fucking clown. I don't have anything else to throw.
[6381.62s -> 6392.22s]  All right. We're on the same team. We're not on the same team. Don't make me do it. Don't. Don't.
[6394.44s -> 6425.91s]  Shit. Why? Okay. I need to sit here for a second. Ruby, I'm sorry.
[6440.46s -> 6445.42s]  Over here. I need some assistance. What the? You didn't even fucking. We need help, please.
[6447.02s -> 6453.10s]  Why would you come investigate? He investigated last time. All right. No fucking around. They're
[6453.10s -> 6472.95s]  both going down instantly. I have to. Here's the play. Person now. Oh, she just. She did a
[6472.95s -> 6505.03s]  lemmings move. It's too gruesome to get my head around. Okay. She comes down. Go investigate.
[6505.99s -> 6512.07s]  Both of you do it. I got to make this very clean. We're doing iron. They both are going to come up.
[6512.07s -> 6520.38s]  Don't hit me, buddy. Watch this. Here we go. Someone help me.
[6539.30s -> 6557.45s]  Okay. New plan. New plan. I have to get it. You have to go down now. Okay. You don't look.
[6558.41s -> 6590.36s]  Hello. Got it. What are you firing? All right. I. We have to. I have to do something else. I have to.
[6590.36s -> 6596.70s]  I have to throw. This is going to be hard. Okay. This is the one. I'm going to try it this time.
[6596.70s -> 6600.22s]  This is going to be the one right now. Promise. Check this out. Ready? Without even a second
[6600.22s -> 6612.68s]  thought, it's going to be hit her. Get body. Iron. Wait. He's going to come up. What a shock.
[6612.68s -> 6616.36s]  Come on up. Take a look. Get a closer look. I need some help over here. No, you don't.
[6616.36s -> 6619.96s]  You need to take care of this. Oh my God. I'm trying to put the bodies higher.
[6621.24s -> 6629.64s]  Fucking God. All right. I got to move on. I have to. This is the last time I'm going to try this.
[6629.64s -> 6669.78s]  Guys, I need some backup. Nothing at my position.
[6676.52s -> 6701.98s]  Yeah. Still looking. Please. Why? Why did I do that? Oh, I'm so mad at myself. Why? I thought I
[6701.98s -> 6710.07s]  could drop down all the way. All right. That's the play. Here's the play. Oh, okay. This is the play.
[6724.38s -> 6741.54s]  So far. No. Okay. I have to run. I'm just going to hide in the box.
[6743.53s -> 6753.67s]  Hide in the box. Turn on the panic room. Quick. Turn it on. Turn it. Go, go, go, turn it on.
[6763.18s -> 6786.79s]  It's done. Ruby saw your face. It doesn't matter. Don't clap for that. Okay. So IT guy.
[6787.59s -> 6827.46s]  IT guy is dead, right? Ruby can get up. That's fine. Compromised. No, that ain't going to work.
[6827.46s -> 6843.67s]  Okay. I'm not going to be like, I can't leave my panic room. I have to get somebody to come in here.
[6843.67s -> 6849.88s]  Okay. I got coins. Who's around that I can get to come in here?
[6849.88s -> 6869.22s]  I need like a security guard, another outfit, something. Here we go. Right there. Get in here.
[6869.22s -> 6881.26s]  Get in here. Come on into the wall. Are you serious? They're bringing the body up. They're
[6881.26s -> 6886.14s]  bringing the body up. They're taking the body out. They're taking the guy out. Not good. Very bad.
[6886.70s -> 6902.12s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. I need that body. I need that body.
[6934.78s -> 6953.37s]  No. Hold on. Oh, I need this. I need. Look at this. I can't play. I need this body.
[6954.01s -> 6968.65s]  Oh my god. They take the body up. No, this is bad. All right. I know what to do.
[6968.65s -> 6990.95s]  Did we see it? Who saw it? Okay. I have to sneak. She's going to see me every time. This is horrible.
[6990.95s -> 7004.46s]  I've soft locked myself. Why do I need the body? Because I need his outfit. Who's around here?
[7005.18s -> 7011.86s]  You're right there. You're back there. Is there? I got to get to the bathroom. All right. I'm
[7011.86s -> 7020.97s]  sneaking to the bathroom. Nobody is going to see. There it is. No, Ruby. No. He's got the body right
[7020.97s -> 7027.46s]  there. All right. I need to. I need a coin right here or an apricot. Doesn't matter what it is.
[7028.02s -> 7048.97s]  You got to be fucking kidding me. They frisk you. They frisk you. How do I throw everything away?
[7048.97s -> 7051.77s]  What's the what's the drop button? How do you drop? How do you drop? How do you drop? How do I drop?
[7051.77s -> 7064.92s]  G? How do I drop? F? How do you drop something? What the fucked up shit do I have in here? Illegal.
[7072.07s -> 7080.20s]  Okay. I'm good. If you want to come through this way, I'm going to have to do it.
[7084.98s -> 7094.25s]  I got to pat you down. Sorry about that. Okay. You're all fine. Off you go. How are you today,
[7094.25s -> 7166.55s]  sir? I'm doing well. Thank you. What? What are you talking about? Okay. I think I did it. No,
[7166.55s -> 7180.79s]  they're going to see me do this. All right. Save. Throw apple. Okay. Throw apple through doors. I
[7180.79s -> 7187.00s]  could you know what I could do. I got three apples. Check it out. Let's see if I can get this done.
[7191.32s -> 7212.60s]  Distracted him. He's in the sky. Throw the apple up. I wonder if I can do this without anybody
[7212.60s -> 7229.66s]  caring. Wait, what? Oh, it's right here. As long as I don't do anything. I mean, that is weird to
[7229.66s -> 7235.19s]  take somebody's clothes out of a body bag. That is that's weird. But how weird is it? Is it weird
[7235.19s -> 7245.64s]  enough for me to get seen? Yes, it is apparently. What the fuck am I going to do about this?
[7252.57s -> 7300.50s]  I'm going to have to throw a coin down the hall somehow. What's going on in here? Unlock. No,
[7300.50s -> 7319.18s]  they're going to take that body out if I'm not. I got to let's see. You go. No, go look for it.
[7319.18s -> 7354.06s]  You got a problem, sir? You move around like somebody just kicked your ass real bad.
[7355.02s -> 7389.82s]  You motherfucker. This is fucking way louder. What do you think that noise was? Go have a look.
[7389.82s -> 7449.48s]  You go look too. Both of you. I got the key, right? I did. Let's go. No illegal items, right? Sir,
[7449.48s -> 7455.94s]  if you want to come through, I'm going to have to pat you down. That's fine. Okay. Thank you, sir.
[7457.22s -> 7462.92s]  This will be over in no time. Who says apples don't come in handy? That's right. That is exactly
[7462.92s -> 7467.64s]  what I said. Good job, sir. Thank you. That was verbatim what I said. Always carry a few apples
[7467.64s -> 7473.61s]  with you. You never know when you're going to need to throw it against a wall. Don't get on the camera
[7473.61s -> 7495.80s]  or whatever. Okay. Up. We got to go up one more. I'm supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be here.
[7502.79s -> 7519.53s]  Save it. It's time. All right. I heard you had a problem with your computer.
[7522.82s -> 7530.94s]  Good problem solving skills. I'm known to be the best. Let's take a look. All right. I'm going to
[7530.94s -> 7552.14s]  put like rat poison coke on her computer. Make the most of it. All right. I'm in. I'm in. Move
[7552.14s -> 7559.54s]  meeting. All right. I moved scanning through director's daily calendar. It became clear that
[7559.54s -> 7564.50s]  she has a meeting planned with Fabian Mann and Mateo Perez. It's scheduled around end of business,
[7564.50s -> 7589.53s]  but should be possible to advance it if needed. Okay. What's this? Newspaper? Is the meeting going
[7589.53s -> 7620.20s]  to be in here? Sabotage the clock. Yeah. Not playing anything. Commemorative token. Oh, nice.
[7620.76s -> 7631.77s]  What else is in here? She's right in there too. All right. Wait. Oh, wait a minute. There's poison.
[7631.77s -> 7671.77s]  Poison. Poisonable shit in here. Okay. Now? When's that meeting? I'm going to go in here.
[7671.77s -> 7685.54s]  Private chambers discovered. It's a hostile area. Okay. I'm not supposed to be in here.
[7685.54s -> 7693.40s]  All right. Wait. I got to wait for that meeting to happen. I got to tamper with the clock too.
[7694.12s -> 7699.96s]  How do I get you guys out of here? Come on. There's got to be something I can throw.
[7700.52s -> 7704.15s]  There we go. Perfect. Just like throw it over here.
[7715.05s -> 7722.22s]  And then you come investigate an apple. Go see what that was.
[7734.41s -> 7754.87s]  Got it. Always carry around a few apples. All right. So now I got to fix the computer. I got
[7754.87s -> 7761.38s]  to fix the internet and then they're going to have a meeting and someone's going to fall out the window.
[7770.31s -> 7792.30s]  I don't know how to fix the router apparently. I don't know how to fix a router. I'm not a real
[7792.30s -> 7813.78s]  IT guy. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Can I even do this? Wait, hold on. Looks like she's
[7813.78s -> 7831.85s]  coming out. Shoot it. No, that'll alert everybody. What else do I got here? Okay. I advanced the
[7831.85s -> 7841.51s]  meeting. Is there anything else I can do to advance this? Because I can't, the internet is not fixable
[7841.51s -> 7851.58s]  now. It was here a minute ago. There she is. Okay. Investigating distraction. What do you mean?
[7851.58s -> 7885.85s]  What distraction? Oh fucking God. What distraction? Where is she going? Oh God, no. Go to the meeting.
[7890.38s -> 7910.22s]  Meeting.
[7934.01s -> 7949.00s]  You're on your own. Run. If your bodyguard or security guard ever says you're on your own, run.
[7950.44s -> 7968.18s]  Okay. Go to the meeting. How do I get them to go to the meeting?
[7977.45s -> 7983.48s]  There aren't anything else I have to do. I have the gramophone. There's no meaning because I killed
[7983.48s -> 8004.18s]  him. Oh, I killed the person that she's talking about. How did I do that? Wait. That's me.
[8004.50s -> 8010.82s]  Now listen to me, Ken. Yeah. I don't want to hear any excuses or answer any questions.
[8011.54s -> 8021.11s]  Just fix my computer and get out. All right. I already did. Everything's good to go.
[8021.83s -> 8083.56s]  I'm going to body block her so she can't leave. Ben, come here. Get up. You did it.
[8086.38s -> 8092.57s]  I'm going to take you. Somebody fucking help me. I got the other key card.
[8099.56s -> 8103.98s]  My computer sucks. So she has one. Who has the other one?
[8103.98s -> 8122.79s]  How are these idiots ever going to find anything?
[8122.79s -> 8129.13s]  You know what? I think it's time. It's time just to make this happen.
[8152.02s -> 8172.20s]  Director Savalas eliminated. Good work, 47. Second backup data disk is secured.
[8172.20s -> 8206.10s]  Just one to go, 47. What is this? Credit card? Oh, wow. I disabled surveillance systems.
[8206.10s -> 8233.93s]  Can they hear me through the glass? Is it going to break? What was that?
[8234.65s -> 8258.95s]  What was that explosion? I'm firing through the glass somehow.
[8269.18s -> 8283.40s]  I need to get the last data disk, but I have no idea where that is.
[8283.40s -> 8296.87s]  The mirror is shooting at you. Okay. Can I store this? I can. Can I take this? I can.
[8298.07s -> 8307.14s]  All right. I'm ready. I need one more data disk. It's out here. Wait, I have to get rid of you.
[8311.58s -> 8332.87s]  This guy's as the agent. Oh, yeah. High security guard. Good to go. Last.
[8333.43s -> 8341.61s]  I think I can see right through me. All right. Let's get out of here.
[8344.95s -> 8356.74s]  Straight out this way. The IT guy was way more secure than this. Everybody can see through this.
[8357.62s -> 8375.10s]  Go fix the router. That's unfixable. I broke it. All right. Down. We have to go into the bank vault.
[8375.10s -> 8383.74s]  Oh, my God. Everybody can see through this. Except for you. Shit. This is a horrible disguise.
[8384.38s -> 8407.90s]  Okay. Down one more level. I'm going to go get all my weapons. They should still be over here.
[8408.70s -> 8432.94s]  Save it. Down one more time. So I should be a high security officer. I'm the bodyguard
[8434.98s -> 8443.29s]  of the objective of the game. Don't get restless. Nothing to report. Yeah, me neither.
[8446.38s -> 8455.38s]  These are perfectly good apples. How could you let these go to waste? I can unlock this.
[8458.97s -> 8464.46s]  I think I have the key card. Yep. I don't even need it. Let's just go into the vault.
[8475.21s -> 8490.65s]  Break open. Security lock enabled. All right. I got to go find the security room.
[8491.94s -> 8499.90s]  I thought the doors were closed. Area discovered. Wait a minute. Hold on.
[8503.22s -> 8511.10s]  Poison. I can put poison into the vents? Car battery?
[8546.36s -> 8558.33s]  I'm trying to shock him. I don't like that. I'm going to get less points for that.
[8558.89s -> 8572.02s]  I have to live with it though. I have no save. Yes, I do. I'm not losing points.
[8575.03s -> 8583.86s]  You already killed four non-targets. So? I'm an assassin. Sometimes you have to do dirty work
[8583.86s -> 8590.25s]  with the bad guys. Turn on the air conditioner. Okay. What about this? Unlock the cabinet.
[8591.05s -> 8599.78s]  What is in here? A chloroform? Okay. I'm allowed in here.
[8615.35s -> 8637.11s]  Okay. Where's the device? Where is it? It's not in here? You're doing easy mode.
[8637.11s -> 8652.73s]  The more people you kill, the more frames drop.
[8657.32s -> 8666.50s]  So what do I need in here? I got to poison this, but they're going to kill them anyways.
[8667.14s -> 8688.62s]  Let's turn this on. So this guy comes out here. And then what? This guy's pissed off. We choke
[8688.62s -> 8694.82s]  him out. I take his outfit because he's... I'm already wearing this disguise. Well,
[8694.82s -> 8726.79s]  that didn't do anything. Okay. What do you mean distraction? They all just want to turn the AC
[8726.79s -> 8747.18s]  off? That's so stupid. I got the key card. They all come out to try to turn the AC off. What about
[8747.18s -> 8783.80s]  you? Yup. I taught him here. Oh my God. I had to let him have a victory here. I got what I needed.
[8783.80s -> 8804.14s]  There's nobody else even down here. Wait, there's another AC person? Oh no, not good. Did he get it
[8804.14s -> 8844.97s]  off? He got his radio. I don't think that mattered. Missing key card. I picked up like four of them.
[8844.97s -> 8862.38s]  None of those were it. Oh shit. Really? All right. Well, it looks like I'm going over here.
[8862.38s -> 8875.45s]  I wonder if I should go up. Where does this lead out? I need a key card to get in there.
[8876.01s -> 8906.07s]  Apparently when I don't have. Are we dropping frames? Oh, that sucks. I wonder why this is
[8906.07s -> 8915.66s]  happening. It's been pretty good for a while, but it doesn't matter. Cox always sucks. Well,
[8915.66s -> 8926.02s]  I have rat poison though. He's just figuring this out now. God damn it. Really? All right. I don't
[8926.02s -> 8939.53s]  want to mess this up. Did I drop one of the other cards? Come on, stop dropping frames. What the
[8939.53s -> 8954.70s]  fuck? What's your deal, Cox? What's your deal? Sorry, I don't. Do I have to open it with something
[8954.70s -> 8979.72s]  else? There's got to be something in this room, right? Got it. Bingo. Let's go. Vault security
[8979.72s -> 8993.48s]  system has been unlocked. Let's do it. And then I beat the level. Should I push the big red button?
[8994.04s -> 9013.34s]  That's a deal. What's in the vault? Trespassing. What do you mean trespassing?
[9017.62s -> 9021.69s]  Uh, I'm going to save it here. That's not good.
[9061.66s -> 9075.26s]  Let's go. What's with the frames? Give me more frames. What the hell? This is horseshit. Oh,
[9075.26s -> 9082.31s]  I'm so glad this is going to be over real soon. I'm going to be on fiber in less than two or three
[9082.31s -> 9101.34s]  months. It's going to be fantastic. I got it. The expose. A lot of things to do, apparently.
[9101.34s -> 9114.65s]  Did he say fiber? No fiber, like fiber optic internet. Fiber to the house. So it's not going
[9114.65s -> 9132.17s]  to be through cable internet, which sucks ass. Oh, am I dead? Stream it. Stream dead. All right.
[9132.17s -> 9162.60s]  Are we good? Oh, this is bad. This just started right now too. It's struggling. One star though.
[9162.60s -> 9179.67s]  How would I get the points? 30,000? Uh, I wonder if I should change. Um, I wonder if I should do
[9179.67s -> 9191.30s]  this. This would probably kill the stream though. No, that's not going to work. Let's see if it'll
[9191.30s -> 9197.62s]  ride itself out. Damn it. Come on. I was having fun too. I knew this was going to be a short
[9197.62s -> 9205.67s]  stream today, but not this short. Uh, I'm going to go take a break. I'm just going to pee. Come
[9205.67s -> 9216.14s]  back, see if we can ride it out. I will be right back. Let's see if this actually, uh, stays live.
[9216.14s -> 9386.23s]  We'll find out. How are we doing? Have we, has it been bad since I left? It's been bad. Shit.
[9388.63s -> 9397.00s]  Even the BRB is getting fucked up. No, I don't want this. I didn't want this to be the last
[9397.00s -> 9400.92s]  thing I do before TwitchCon. Come on. I wanted to go for at least like three, four, five hours.
[9401.32s -> 9422.79s]  Ah, just do a comb stream. I really wanted to get these two DLCs done today though,
[9423.35s -> 9435.98s]  but I obviously don't want to stream if it's going to be shitty. Um, yeah, I don't want to stream
[9435.98s -> 9443.16s]  this. I did say that I was only going to stream for like three hours or so, three to four today,
[9443.72s -> 9447.19s]  because I have to get ready to go and put TwitchCon, but I'm not going to leave yet.
[9447.19s -> 9453.19s]  Well, um, we'll just hang out for a little bit. See if I'm going to, I'm hoping now it's still
[9453.19s -> 9463.24s]  dropping. Damn it. You might get a random vlog from TwitchCon, just like an hour long stream.
[9464.04s -> 9468.38s]  I don't know if I'm going to do that though. So don't hold me to that. I might not have an
[9468.38s -> 9474.81s]  opportunity to, cause I'm not going to be there for very long, but, uh, I don't want to continue
[9474.81s -> 9480.26s]  to do this if it's going to be unwatchable for people. So those of you that are just going to
[9480.26s -> 9486.62s]  take off, uh, I guess you can consider this like the end of the stream. I will see you guys later.
[9486.62s -> 9491.45s]  If you're going to TwitchCon, make sure you say hello. I'm going to have a toothpick in my mouth,
[9492.31s -> 9504.70s]  find the guy with the toothpick. That's me. But for the next like hour or so,
[9505.26s -> 9513.50s]  we're just going to painfully deal with this until I, uh, take off. So you'll see me again.
[9516.02s -> 9529.38s]  I'm so salty about this right now. Damn it. It's going to zero and shit. Ah, day before fucking
[9529.38s -> 9532.90s]  Twitch. Whatever. It's all right. I can't, I'm not going to sit here and be, uh, pissed off by this.
[9532.90s -> 9538.57s]  Uh, I'm going to go like this. At least we got to go through one full hitman mission.
[9539.13s -> 9545.30s]  I would like to do both of them. Sometimes you can't do what you want, I guess.
[9547.77s -> 9554.04s]  Do talk to transformer. Uh, we'll see. I'll show you guys my, let's just get out of this,
[9559.62s -> 9567.37s]  but thanks for watching. Regardless, a nice, a nice quick two hour and 22 minutes stream.
[9567.37s -> 9572.47s]  It's like the old days. This reminds me of back when I first started on Twitch,
[9572.47s -> 9577.69s]  I would stream for like two to three hours. Remember when I did that? Yeah. Just remember this,
[9577.69s -> 9592.41s]  pretend like this dream happened like six years ago. This over here, this should switch over to
[9592.41s -> 9606.46s]  here again. We can hang out and do the bits too. Just chill again. If you're going to Twitch con,
[9606.46s -> 9628.07s]  please say hello. Hopefully we even stay up long enough to do this. Ouch. All right. Change the
[9628.07s -> 9645.13s]  category. Yeah. I've been looking, I'm looking at my stream health on the, on my dashboard.
[9645.13s -> 9655.14s]  It's just zero up, zero up, zero up, not healthy stream. Apparently I know Twitch I'm trying.
[9655.70s -> 9668.73s]  All right. Let's head over here. Uh, let's turn on. Let's move. I wonder if this is going to work.
[9672.60s -> 9680.31s]  Is this still taking it from yesterday? I think this is taking it from yesterday.
[9680.31s -> 9692.10s]  Why is it not working? See you later. I didn't take a stream. It was the same, same people. Yeah.
[9692.74s -> 9699.82s]  I'll be back on Tuesday, most likely. And I'll probably just end up starting with Hitman 2,
[9699.82s -> 9705.16s]  just to try to finish that. And then we'll move on to something else. Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
[9705.16s -> 9713.67s]  This is not the way that I wanted this to end. You got to do what you got to do. Uh, I'm going to put
[9713.67s -> 9725.83s]  on the wonderful music. I still don't, I don't know why this shit is. I got to figure this out
[9725.83s -> 9735.64s]  when I come back, but let's do the bits. Let me put the camera on. We'll just sit here and talk.
[9739.99s -> 9748.50s]  Let's do that. How do I, where is it? Oh, it's this one here. Let's see. I'll prove to you guys that
[9748.50s -> 9762.28s]  I shaved. If you want to see, is that going to work? Wrong one. This one's cool too though.
[9762.84s -> 9780.46s]  Where's my, where's the camera? Oh, there's the camera. It just buttoned on. Oh,
[9780.46s -> 9794.28s]  that's what I wanted to do. I shaved, see? Hey, there we go. I got a shaved face. I can actually
[9794.28s -> 9806.97s]  make this smaller. All right. Streamlabs OBS. I kind of don't like you at all because it's hard
[9806.97s -> 9813.40s]  to move shit around in the scenes. You know what I'm talking about? It's like it locks shit around.
[9813.40s -> 9820.58s]  I haven't figured out how to turn it off. It's like, it's like almost harder to use.
[9828.49s -> 9838.89s]  All right, there we go. Let's move this over here. So if you're at TwitchCon, say hello. If you're
[9838.89s -> 9846.01s]  not at TwitchCon, then whatever, maybe we'll see you on Tuesday. Check the nails too. Did those look
[9846.01s -> 9858.76s]  cut to you? Told you. Told you I was going to do it. All right, now I got to go over here.
[9858.76s -> 9869.88s]  So I should do this. The music's getting louder, I know. Let's do the bits. It shouldn't take us
[9869.88s -> 9878.76s]  very long. We had, I'm not going to yell over it. Zake, thanks for the 250, Zake. You're going to
[9878.76s -> 9884.97s]  do a nail painting stream. I don't think, I don't think so. But thank you Zake for the 250. So I
[9884.97s -> 9889.53s]  translated the Minecraft copy pasta through every other language in Google Translate and back to
[9889.53s -> 9896.54s]  English. And this is what came out. In the game, it's awesome. Yes, there are peas, peanuts, beans,
[9896.54s -> 9903.61s]  and various products. We hope you enjoy the place. Black sauce, pour it back. But drinking
[9903.61s -> 9914.55s]  apple pie might not be so good. So that is the, that's the intro to the, to Minecraft.
[9914.55s -> 9928.30s]  Well, that's, that's good, I guess. Actually sounds pretty fun. Sounds like a fun game.
[9930.97s -> 9934.97s]  Drinking apple pie. That, yeah, that's called half the items at Starbucks.
[9936.47s -> 9940.07s]  I wouldn't order them if I were you. You come up, I would get, get like an ice coffee. Don't
[9940.07s -> 9948.18s]  get anything else. Uh, OC, oh, OcRolo, thanks for the thousand bits. Please use these measly pennies
[9948.18s -> 9952.89s]  to buy an eighth of a gigabyte of RAM. You need it. I need it. I'm probably going to get a new
[9952.89s -> 9958.26s]  computer. It's been about like three or four years, so I'm probably going to do new PC soon.
[9959.46s -> 9969.64s]  Within 12 months. I got, I want to get like a new RTX 2080. Get a new, um, right, 2090. Is
[9969.64s -> 9977.78s]  that coming out soon? I know there's one coming out. Should I do AMD? Should I do AMD instead?
[9977.78s -> 9987.11s]  Don't need fully new. Yeah, but I have, I have a 6800 or think, uh, CPU. I could do for, I could
[9987.11s -> 9996.26s]  do for an upgrade. I want to do like a supercomputer. What's the equivalent of the latest Intel
[9996.26s -> 10010.30s]  processors? Are they good? AMD CPU, Nvidia GPU. That's what I was thinking. AMD CPU. I, you know,
[10010.30s -> 10017.30s]  I actually heard that AMD really is starting to sincerely give Intel a run for their money.
[10017.30s -> 10021.22s]  Just like their processors are just better now. It used to be the complete opposite.
[10022.33s -> 10028.33s]  AMD was always like, oh, you have AMD. I've got Intel, Intel inside. And it was always like,
[10028.33s -> 10032.78s]  okay, yeah, that's, yeah, that's right. Intel's way better. They're kind of flipping, aren't they?
[10033.34s -> 10040.60s]  They're caught. Yeah. They, they, they're way cheaper too. AMD has gotten considered a bit. Yeah,
[10040.60s -> 10043.40s]  you know, I probably will. I'll probably do like one of those, what, thread rippers,
[10044.04s -> 10049.16s]  just get something crazy and water cool it. But then you can't bring it anywhere. That's the thing.
[10049.16s -> 10054.52s]  All right. The thing about having a huge, insane supercomputer PC is yeah, man, this thing's got
[10054.52s -> 10060.84s]  like liquified, hydrogenized oil that's cooled to negative five degrees Celsius. It goes through
[10060.84s -> 10065.40s]  all these tubes. The tubes are made out of glass, by the way. So never move this computer.
[10065.88s -> 10068.68s]  Don't ever pick it up. Don't even fucking pick it up and put it somewhere else.
[10068.68s -> 10074.79s]  When you put that 112 pound machine somewhere, that's a full tower. You ain't moving it ever
[10074.79s -> 10081.70s]  again. I would be so scared to, to like bring that computer anywhere to ever move. I would
[10081.70s -> 10087.53s]  think I would break everything, everything. All the hydrogenized oil would come out. It'd be
[10087.53s -> 10093.82s]  terrifying. Yeah. Even with this one now, it was scary. It's kind of heavy and I feel like I'm
[10093.82s -> 10099.45s]  going to drop it. I'm just going to hire somebody to take care of it. It's like having somebody
[10099.45s -> 10104.41s]  watch your dog, you know, like, Oh, I'm going away for the week. Somebody watch my dog for me. I'm
[10104.41s -> 10111.69s]  going away for the week. Somebody watch my computer, please. And make them and let them out,
[10111.69s -> 10117.46s]  let them out a few times and like open up the thing at the bottom. And it like pisses out stream
[10117.46s -> 10125.77s]  you building it. I would, I would never build a PC like that. That's so much money that I would
[10125.77s -> 10131.83s]  literally just be deleting because I would break something. Having like the GPU have the tubes on
[10131.83s -> 10138.15s]  it that you have to take off the GPU fan case, put on the your own heat sink. No, no, no. Somebody
[10138.15s -> 10147.37s]  else has to do that for me. I can put memory into a slot and I can put video card into slot.
[10147.37s -> 10153.80s]  That's about all I'm comfortable doing. I used to be a PC computer doctor, but I lost a lot of
[10153.80s -> 10160.20s]  business. I had like 1.4 stars on Yelp because I did a stream and I did a thing where I was like
[10160.20s -> 10164.92s]  showing people how to build and I got a lot of flack for it. So I was at like a 3.8 and then
[10164.92s -> 10170.33s]  it went down to 1.4. So I decided I was going to kind of just give it up. I guess it's what I was
[10170.33s -> 10177.82s]  doing for a long time. So, and the thing is, most of my customers were old ladies. So I don't know
[10177.82s -> 10181.90s]  how it was weird how that happened, but they'd come in and I would give them the computer back.
[10181.90s -> 10186.71s]  I would fix it. I'd do everything I needed to. I'd build them a computer and I never, they never,
[10186.71s -> 10192.52s]  I never got like a call. I never got like a mean phone call or anything. They seemed pretty happy
[10192.52s -> 10205.06s]  about it. But anyways, thank you. Thank you to, that's, that was oh, Acrolo, Acrolo. Mini clips,
[10205.06s -> 10209.27s]  thanks with thousand bits. Here's some bits for a new computer. Keep having a good stream.
[10209.35s -> 10215.77s]  It was until I started to drop a bunch of frames and it was happening for long enough where I
[10215.77s -> 10222.55s]  decided I was just going to call it. So you'll see Hitman again. And right when I start talking
[10222.55s -> 10229.45s]  about it, there it goes. It's almost like it can fucking hear me. It can fucking hear me talking.
[10229.45s -> 10237.45s]  It can hear me. I said that and then it turned off. What the fuck is happening? Who was listening
[10237.45s -> 10242.81s]  to this shit and doing this? Somebody just sitting there with like a dial from zero to 10 and they're
[10242.81s -> 10249.02s]  just turning it. We even had a problem with this in like at least three or four weeks either.
[10249.02s -> 10255.64s]  It's been like a month or so since it was a real issue kind of like this. Oh well, I'll make a call
[10255.64s -> 10263.72s]  see if they can do something about it when I'm gone for TwitchCon. So we'll see. But thank you.
[10263.72s -> 10269.67s]  Mini clips for the thousand bits. Appreciate it. Acrolo again gave 500 bits. Wait, never mind.
[10269.67s -> 10274.36s]  You'll just spend it on a clown costume. Clown costumes are way more expensive than you think.
[10274.36s -> 10279.96s]  It's, it's like 80 to a hundred dollars plus for a nice, maybe even like $200 for a nice clown
[10279.96s -> 10287.10s]  costume. We're not talking just like a t-shirt. No, no, we're talking a silk, fully complete
[10287.10s -> 10293.03s]  overalls. It's way more expensive. I'll be in one for during the entirety of TwitchCon. That's how
[10293.03s -> 10300.18s]  you'll find me. I'll be the clown with the toothpick. But thank you for the 10 bucks. Appreciate it.
[10300.18s -> 10307.19s]  We also had sad Vega gave $2.50 a belated birthday to you, Jerma. How's it feel to be 34?
[10307.19s -> 10312.02s]  Feels, it doesn't feel that bad actually. It feels okay. It doesn't, I don't, it's all right.
[10312.02s -> 10318.44s]  It doesn't bother me. When I turned 31, it bothered me. When I turned 32, it didn't.
[10318.44s -> 10323.85s]  So I hope that answers your question. But thank you for the $2.50. Thank you fat
[10324.41s -> 10331.37s]  Sanic for the 500 bits. No message. They just say, uh, cheer 500. Thank you, uh, fat Sonic.
[10331.37s -> 10337.21s]  I really appreciate it. Also thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50. Is this a stealth game week or
[10337.21s -> 10346.52s]  something? First the goose game, now Hitman. Then Jerma tries not to be seen at TwitchCon.
[10346.52s -> 10353.94s]  I mean it, it, it is whatever you want to call it. What if I really just tried to just not have
[10353.94s -> 10359.72s]  anybody see me? I should tweet out a place that I am and I'm just not there at all. Hey, I gotta
[10359.72s -> 10363.56s]  be standing in front of this statue of the guy from Borderlands. And I just, I'm not there.
[10363.56s -> 10369.58s]  And I'm just sitting somewhere else within distance, within like visual line of sight
[10369.58s -> 10382.04s]  distance of that place and just like counting who comes over. Three, two hours, four. Okay.
[10382.04s -> 10388.09s]  I got four fans. I got four people that like me here. And then the next day I know I got four
[10388.09s -> 10392.62s]  people. So I'm just like, Hey, uh, the four of you. And people are like, wait, okay, so how did he
[10392.62s -> 10404.98s]  know that? Come visit me at the coffee station. I'll be there. It's Saturday morning is when I'm
[10404.98s -> 10409.86s]  going to be there the most time. Saturday morning into Saturday early afternoon. That's the window
[10409.86s -> 10416.42s]  that I'm going to be at TwitchCon. And then I will probably show up at that party for a little while
[10416.42s -> 10421.14s]  because I gotta, you know, be the toothpick guy. And, uh, I try to wink with this eye, but I can't,
[10421.14s -> 10428.73s]  I can't, I can't wink with my left eye. It's too hard for me to do. I can only go like this and I
[10428.73s -> 10432.65s]  have to turn my whole face upside down when I do it. I can't wink with my other eye. It pulls my
[10432.65s -> 10438.41s]  mouth over. It's weird. Uh, it's like there's a fishing line here attached to this eye tight
[10439.05s -> 10449.06s]  to here. It's odd, but, uh, thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. Also to, uh,
[10449.06s -> 10458.60s]  Final Fantasy 12 Penelo. FF12 Penelo. I don't know why I just said Final Fantasy. Botox.
[10460.12s -> 10465.96s]  Not getting Botox. Once you get Botox, that's what you admit that you're old. That's my opinion. The
[10465.96s -> 10472.49s]  second that you get Botox injected somewhere, I am admitting that I am old. Maybe that'll happen
[10472.49s -> 10479.08s]  when I'm 45. I don't know. Maybe it'll never happen. Maybe I'll never feel old. Maybe I,
[10479.08s -> 10483.32s]  and then you, and then if you do it too much, you end up looking, it looks too much. You know,
[10483.40s -> 10490.10s]  it looks like you did it too much. No, not gonna happen. Just try to age. I'm gonna try to age
[10490.10s -> 10497.72s]  like a nice red blend. Should be all right. What do you think about the shave job? See you in two
[10497.72s -> 10505.75s]  days when it looks real good. But we only got a few more. We got, uh, that was, uh, FF12 Penelo.
[10505.75s -> 10510.47s]  They said, I turned your stream on at work, promptly forgot I did. So when I put my headphones back in,
[10510.47s -> 10516.33s]  I was like, who the fuck is talking and realized. Anyways, genuinely thanks for what you do for
[10516.33s -> 10523.05s]  real. It always cheers me up when I need it. I think I would probably be, I was, and that's weird,
[10523.05s -> 10528.95s]  audio to hear too. Playing Hitman and talking about like strangling people and poisoning people.
[10529.51s -> 10533.48s]  I don't understand. Like I poisoned him. Why is he getting up? I poisoned that guy.
[10534.12s -> 10539.64s]  Oh my God. What the fuck, dude? Why is he waking up? I'm gonna throw an apple in his head. You'd be
[10539.64s -> 10554.12s]  like, I need to get like a new computer. Oh my God. Mugga ass. But, uh, if you can let me be on
[10554.12s -> 10559.40s]  at work, hopefully you have it in a situation where it's okay. And it's not going to be bad
[10559.40s -> 10563.88s]  that if you accidentally unplug your headphones and all of a sudden you, your boss hears me saying
[10563.88s -> 10567.72s]  fuck. Uh, they're not going to think you said it and then you're going to get in trouble.
[10567.72s -> 10571.64s]  So hopefully you got a situation there where it's okay. You got to like a system. You always have to
[10571.64s -> 10576.68s]  have like a good system. Uh, and make, and, and make sure you get your work done too. As I don't
[10576.68s -> 10580.04s]  want to just burn all your time there. Cause then they're going to blame me. And what if I get the
[10580.04s -> 10587.35s]  call from HR? What if my stream gets banned from your company? That's at least like six or seven
[10587.35s -> 10604.04s]  followers that I'm going to lose. I can't, I can't have that six or 7,000. No, but thank you. Uh,
[10604.04s -> 10613.16s]  thank you to not, not Hugsy. Uh, they said fix your internet. It's sad because I've fixed,
[10613.16s -> 10621.21s]  I've fixed this internet probably 15 to 16 times and it'll all be done soon. It's all going to be
[10621.21s -> 10629.69s]  over soon. Fiber to the home. I'm going to be on a direct thousand thousand connection,
[10630.33s -> 10635.77s]  true fiber. And then we can fucking forget that any of this shit ever happened.
[10638.46s -> 10641.58s]  I'm going to have like the best internet you can possibly purchase.
[10643.08s -> 10650.68s]  That is consumer grade internet at least I'm going on the fiber diet. That's right.
[10652.36s -> 10657.48s]  I can't wait. I can't wait to boot it up and have it be worse than this, which is that's not
[10657.48s -> 10662.92s]  possible. If you got direct fiber to the house, no fucking way. All these issues are because coax
[10662.92s -> 10673.85s]  sucks ass. Coax cable sucks total asshole. It is a fiber optic line. So all the dropping the frames,
[10673.85s -> 10680.01s]  the packet loss, the fucking dropouts, that's all because the cable companies suck and they have
[10680.01s -> 10685.90s]  laid this fucking groundwork that's been there for like 40 years and they're all dog shit.
[10685.90s -> 10691.90s]  All these lines of trash. So now that fiber is being laid out and they have to have it now,
[10692.70s -> 10696.86s]  you have, you, you'll be on a, if you can get on an actual to the home fiber,
[10697.74s -> 10702.70s]  all these issues disappear. They don't exist anymore. There's no noise. There's no like
[10702.70s -> 10707.98s]  ingress noise and packet problems when you're dealing with a fiber, a true fiber to the home.
[10708.70s -> 10715.34s]  You can have internet problems, but not like you do with coax. I fucking hate coax. Coax sucks.
[10715.34s -> 10719.67s]  I don't even want it plugged into the back of my fucking TV anymore. I'm going saddle.
[10719.67s -> 10734.25s]  Oops. Oops. Looks like somebody may have cut the bike. By the way, I just realized that there's
[10734.25s -> 10738.84s]  stuff going on in the background here. Is that an I? Is that a G? Is that a J? What is that?
[10738.84s -> 10745.26s]  It says there's like a monster on the left. I didn't even see that. Coax has less latency.
[10745.90s -> 10749.02s]  I would rather have stability than care about a few milliseconds of latency.
[10749.74s -> 10755.02s]  Coax has so many fucking problems. It doesn't matter where I am. I've, I've used three or four
[10755.02s -> 10762.12s]  different coax lines and they would just dog shit. So we'll see. Maybe I'll have my, maybe
[10762.12s -> 10767.40s]  fiber is worse, but there's no way it is. I've been told by every person that works in like
[10767.40s -> 10771.88s]  internet infrastructure that if you can get on fiber, get on it because it's a thousand times
[10771.88s -> 10777.88s]  more stable and better and more consistent than coax. So I'm like, thanks. I appreciate that.
[10778.60s -> 10786.30s]  And I'm going to be on it in a couple of months, but I think it's time to see if I set this up
[10786.30s -> 10792.70s]  correctly. If fiber is worse, what are you going to do? Um, shit my pants because at that point,
[10792.70s -> 10796.46s]  what the fuck am I going to do? I'm going to make my own. I'm going to have to like make my own
[10796.46s -> 10804.25s]  internet. Uh, let's see if this works. I want to see, can it work? I just need to know. Never
[10804.25s -> 10813.58s]  mind. It's not going to work. Oh, he blew it. He really blew it. I think. Yeah, he did. It's all
[10813.58s -> 10823.46s]  right. I didn't, I didn't set up correctly, but thank you to Mark Alter, Mark Alter. Thanks for
[10823.46s -> 10829.38s]  the $3. Enjoyed the stream. Good luck with the internet. And I, oh, I hit you in the eye. Now
[10829.38s -> 10833.86s]  you can't see. Sorry. Yeah. I'm going to, I'll make a few calls and see what's going on. Hopefully
[10833.86s -> 10837.78s]  they can get somebody out here and just turn the nozzle. Like apparently they do every time. And
[10837.78s -> 10841.78s]  then it's fine for like a month and a half. I don't understand, but, uh, I will see everybody
[10841.78s -> 10848.47s]  at TwitchCon, whoever's going. If you go into the show floor, I'll be there on Saturday. If not,
[10848.47s -> 10852.55s]  if you go into the party, if you make it there, I'll be there somewhere dancing with a toothpick.
[10855.62s -> 10861.24s]  Thank you guys. Here come the credits. Uh, door cube though, two 50 from door cube. I knew you
[10861.24s -> 10864.76s]  were going to shave your face in preparation to TwitchCon. That's what I told you guys that last
[10864.76s -> 10868.84s]  night, but I didn't realize you were going to get a haircut too, but I guess you needed one since you
[10868.84s -> 10879.83s]  played cosplaying as Daniel clamp from gremlins two. Is that the guy, the tie guy? That's the guy
[10879.83s -> 10890.14s]  with the tire, right? Oh, I know. Here come the credits by the way. Thank you everybody. Whoever
[10890.14s -> 10894.94s]  subbed in this kind of what did less than two hour period. It's still a lot of people leaving those
[10894.94s -> 10900.82s]  streams are going to only be a two or three hours long. Hope you enjoyed hitman for how, as long as
[10900.82s -> 10909.02s]  we got to play it before I had to stop. When I come back on Tuesday, we will do the second hitman
[10909.02s -> 10915.08s]  mission, clean it up, do the DLC, finish it up and move on from there. I thought there was something
[10915.08s -> 10918.84s]  wrong, but that's a person's username. I was like something, the spacing is incorrect on that.
[10918.84s -> 10929.13s]  This is really slow compared to yesterday. Yeah. Well, well yesterday was also eight hours and that
[10929.13s -> 10934.74s]  was also the first time I'd really come back, um, at my desk in about eight or nine days.
[10935.88s -> 10940.92s]  This is still a lot of people do not get me wrong there. This is still a shitload of people that
[10940.92s -> 10950.73s]  will sub in the two hours. Hey, cut tack. Thanks for the 500 bits stream extension. Oh, I see what
[10950.73s -> 10956.50s]  you know. Right. Yeah. Okay. Zake. Thanks for the 250. You are in the Minecraft copy pasta again for
[10956.50s -> 10962.82s]  Google translate. This time all languages. He is the creator of the first chapter of creation.
[10962.82s -> 10977.88s]  All other games are important games. You can have a cup of tea. I want to be a magician. At least I
[10977.88s -> 10987.37s]  got the last part right. Oh, this last one, this is a Siroc. Thank you Siroc for the 250. They say
[10987.37s -> 10992.34s]  goat hog champ German Venus. It's them watching the stream with a goat. Are they at the anti-mark
[10992.34s -> 11006.46s]  goats still available? Can we confirm? I don't think there's probably a very many left. Let's see.
[11006.46s -> 11014.39s]  Got one. You got one. Is it over? It is over. I had to stop because of the internet, but it's okay
[11014.39s -> 11020.26s]  though, because I do have a lot of shit that I still need to take care of before leaving stuff
[11020.26s -> 11025.62s]  that is not even Twitch con related stuff. That is my real life related that I have not been able
[11025.62s -> 11031.26s]  to do because I've not been here for four or five straight days after I got back. So I will see you
[11031.26s -> 11037.05s]  guys soon. Take care. So you have to Twitch con. I might turn the stream on at Twitch con. I don't
[11037.05s -> 11041.37s]  know why I would though. Maybe like eating spaghetti for like 30 minutes. It's only going to be like a
[11041.37s -> 11050.70s]  20 minute stream. If I do at least show this to you guys because it's funny. Take a look at that
[11050.70s -> 11058.82s]  link, get your anti-mark goat. If they're still available, which I don't think they are. Thanks
[11058.82s -> 11066.10s]  for hanging out everybody. See you real soon. Take care of yourselves and have a great weekend,
[11066.10s -> 11078.98s]  regardless if you're going to be a Twitch con or not. See you soon guys. Now there's no audio on
[11078.98s -> 11087.11s]  this. I broke something. I broke something. I don't, you know, it's just a lot of technical
[11087.11s -> 11094.39s]  things going on today. But before I leave, BorealBeast gave a thousand bits. Hey German,
[11094.39s -> 11098.07s]  this is my first time cheering. It's my birthday today and I wanted to give you something back to
[11098.07s -> 11102.70s]  one of my absolute favorite people as well. Love you and your content. Thank you so much for always
[11102.70s -> 11107.66s]  making me laugh and get me through tough times. I know you hear this a lot, but I really mean it.
[11107.66s -> 11115.51s]  Happy fucking birthday. Hope you have a great one. That was BorealBeast. Anytime I hear about the
[11115.51s -> 11119.59s]  stream people like and people have a great time here, it makes me, don't, don't worry if you,
[11119.59s -> 11124.25s]  you know, I know you hear this a lot kind of scenario. Every time somebody says that,
[11124.25s -> 11128.82s]  it doesn't matter how many times I hear it. It makes me happy every single time. Thank you.
[11128.82s -> 11134.36s]  And thanks for the thousand bits. And then HeatLegend thanks for 250. While I can't attend
[11134.36s -> 11138.04s]  TwitchCon, I hope you have a great time in San Diego. It rained for the first time today in
[11138.04s -> 11142.10s]  over a month, so I hope the weather isn't shitty for you when you get here. This would be the first
[11142.10s -> 11149.48s]  time I've been to San Diego as well. Well, not as well. You live there, I think, as it sounds.
[11149.56s -> 11157.45s]  But yeah, this is the first time being there. I will see you guys later. Take care. Good night.
[11157.45s -> 11159.74s]  I gotta go get ready. See you soon.
