[3.19s -> 10.25s]  Hey, very dark in here. I know. Play with chopsticks for an hour? I'm not gonna do that.
[10.25s -> 15.45s]  I want to make sure this is not loud. Let's turn it down for you because I don't blow your ears out.
[19.43s -> 22.87s]  Okay, I have to install it. Okay, the bitrate's gonna drop like a shitload because it's gonna
[22.87s -> 39.48s]  take over all my internet, so I don't have it downloaded. Okay. Revolt? Animal Revolt Battle
[39.48s -> 46.55s]  Simulator. Is this gonna be funny? I don't know, we'll find out. I'm gonna get it. Well, I already
[46.55s -> 60.07s]  have it. That's a lie. Use coconut oil? Alright, internet's gonna go- the stream's gonna like die
[60.07s -> 74.84s]  for a second. Alright, done. Downloaded. Yeah, that was literally- do you understand the power
[74.84s -> 80.55s]  of fiber optics? That was- that was a 1.1 gigabyte game and it downloaded in three seconds.
[80.55s -> 87.88s]  Just the power of fucking absolute gigabyte. Alright, let's go. I need to update the title
[87.88s -> 99.38s]  too because the title makes no sense. What's this game called? Animal Revolt Battle Simulator. Okay.
[107.00s -> 114.46s]  Loud. Good thing I turned it down. Alright, yeah. Early access. Wait, you can do dinosaurs versus
[114.46s -> 140.98s]  like- hold on a minute. This might be cool. This could be pretty cool. Why can't- I can't
[140.98s -> 150.97s]  capture the game for some reason. Come on, capture the game. It's right here. Capture.
[154.55s -> 171.29s]  Psycho energy? Yeah. Let me try capturing it again. Oh, there it is. Alright, good. Alright,
[171.29s -> 182.87s]  so this game- should I do campaign? Tutorial? Big announcement? Alright. This game looks like dog
[182.87s -> 187.83s]  shit but it's fun. Alright, well you- I was kind of rude right off the bat. Can I do the tutorial?
[188.71s -> 195.83s]  Sandbox basics. Welcome to the sandbox basics tutorial. Sandbox basics. Click on the unit
[195.83s -> 202.22s]  groups button to open the unit groups menu. Okay. Select units here. You can choose different groups
[202.22s -> 209.34s]  of animals, weapons, buildings, and landscape items. You can even create weaponized animals
[209.34s -> 216.52s]  by attaching various weapons, armor, and gear on them. Okay. Once you have selected a unit group,
[217.40s -> 220.68s]  the icons for the units belong to that group will appear in the bottom panel.
[221.40s -> 229.08s]  Alright. Click on one of the unit icons and start placing units on the map. You can change
[229.08s -> 235.90s]  the initial rotation of the unit using the mouse scroll. Okay. Eight bucks. Modify various proportions
[235.90s -> 244.73s]  of the animals like detection distance, HP, multiplier, etc. Click on the J key to see the
[244.73s -> 252.09s]  properties of the animals. Click on H to see the animal health bars. Units we have created so far
[252.09s -> 257.53s]  belong to team one which is your team. You can see the total cost of your army is 16 dollars.
[258.25s -> 264.68s]  Okay. Place units for other teams. Click on the team button and select another team number. You
[264.68s -> 270.38s]  can also use the number keys on your keyboard blah blah blah. Clear buttons allow you to clear all
[270.38s -> 277.54s]  the units. We are placing units for team two now. Note team two units are marked by red circles.
[278.18s -> 282.10s]  Click on the start button to begin the battle. You can end the battle at any point by clicking
[282.10s -> 287.29s]  the escape button. Okay. Click on the options menu to set the map properties. You can change
[287.29s -> 291.61s]  the landscape, time of day, etc. Click on the question mark to access the tutorial. Yeah, yeah,
[291.61s -> 296.49s]  yeah. Edit stuff. If you make a mistake when the building, yeah, yeah, yeah. Click undo. Control Z
[296.49s -> 300.17s]  works too. You can save all your maps for later use there. Sounds cool. This concludes the tutorial.
[300.17s -> 312.47s]  You're ready to start playing around. Alright. Alright. We do just campaign. Let's start with
[312.47s -> 333.74s]  the campaign. First person shooter maps. Alright. Tutorial. Okay. Double click to make the gorilla
[333.74s -> 357.27s]  run. Click on the escape key to exit the battle. Okay. Select animals. Go begin. Oh, okay. Okay,
[357.27s -> 371.83s]  that was stupid. You can make your own creations. Okay. Well, we're gonna give me a second. Select
[371.83s -> 376.15s]  all those fine looking men by holding the left mouse button. Drag. Okay. This is a good RTS.
[376.89s -> 380.01s]  One man will struggle to move past a heavy wood plank, but together they should be able to make
[380.01s -> 409.40s]  their way to the flag. Can I get a better view? Alright. I got it. It's Warcraft 3. All those
[409.40s -> 412.92s]  poor dinosaurs are blind and immobile. Select all your archers and right click on the dinosaurs
[412.92s -> 434.49s]  to shoot them down. Hold the middle mouse button to activate slow mode. Oh shit. Okay. So this is how
[434.49s -> 458.30s]  you fight. I want to zoom in. Okay. Cool. How do I move the camera? Q-W-E-A-S-M-D to move the camera
[458.30s -> 473.16s]  around. Alright. Camera rotation. Oh shit. Alright. I get it. Tab rotates. There's a cute little pig
[473.16s -> 485.72s]  hiding around here somewhere. Where is it? Where are you? Inside of one of these things?
[492.92s -> 496.36s]  Last. Really? Okay. God damn it. Alright. Pig in there. Got it.
[496.36s -> 523.51s]  Instruct your rocket man to destroy it. That's kind of sad. Why? Okay. I don't like this.
[525.43s -> 536.36s]  Okay. Create animals with a budget of a thousand dollars and an animal count of 25. Okay.
[537.26s -> 572.95s]  Animals. Ancient humans. About, uh, a knight? Okay. That was kind of unfair. That was really
[572.95s -> 587.54s]  unfair. Okay. This white character is your FPS avatar. Left mouse click on it and press F to
[587.54s -> 613.13s]  take control. What? Are you serious? Why can I do this? Okay. That's actually pretty cool.
[614.22s -> 641.34s]  That's funny. Defoe letter grade? Almost. There's a car. You got it. Okay. Reach the goal. Okay.
[641.90s -> 651.67s]  Almost done. Take control of FPS. I can reach one of them. You can destroy the tower with a grenade
[651.67s -> 669.43s]  launcher. Whoa. Are you serious? I actually get to use this stuff? Alright. I got it. It's tabs,
[669.43s -> 678.98s]  but FPS. Mom, I want to play tabs. We have tabs at home. Alright. Stop. Take control of the FPS
[678.98s -> 690.89s]  avatar and then go to the enemy spawner to disable it. Okay. Let's go. Let's move. Wait. Why are the
[690.89s -> 710.17s]  enemies pigs? Alright. Destroy the enemy spawner. How do I destroy the spawner? I feel like I'm
[710.17s -> 725.45s]  playing Dusk. Alright. Tutorial is almost over and then I can play. Final tutorial.
[725.45s -> 733.18s]  This poor little hippo has no chance against a bunch of angry humans with baseball bats. Attach
[733.18s -> 757.46s]  some weapons to the hippo. Missile launcher? Okay. Oh, a limit one. Shit. Okay. Well, that's fine.
[763.02s -> 778.92s]  Okay. Why does it not hurt the hippo? Okay. This game actually can be really fun. Alright. Tutorial
[778.92s -> 795.35s]  done. Let's go. Human salvation. Okay. This is humans. Remember that you can control the movement
[795.35s -> 801.06s]  of your units using your mouse. Alright. So I have to be, I have to win. What do you got? You've got
[802.74s -> 809.56s]  people with axes and shields and shit. Okay. Ancient humans. I'm going to go with Archie the
[809.56s -> 817.88s]  archer. It's 10 bucks. I'm going to put concentrated in one spot so that it's like one
[817.88s -> 824.79s]  giant arrow landing down on their heads. I'm going to put them in what I call a bowling formation.
[824.79s -> 843.88s]  This should be good. Okay. Bowling formation done. Any pins? Alright. I think we're ready.
[845.21s -> 859.64s]  Start. Oh, they have shields. This didn't work the way that I thought it was going to work.
[866.47s -> 885.88s]  Absolutely obliterated. Is there anybody left? You guys suck. Use the RTS commands. Wait, I can?
[887.88s -> 895.14s]  Oh shit. I can. Alright. Did I win? I almost won. Oh god damn it. Okay. I forgot about that.
[896.66s -> 900.66s]  Let us gamble. That's not a bad idea. But let me get the swing of the things first.
[900.66s -> 908.28s]  Let me get the swing of things first before you lose all your money. How much am I? 15?
[908.28s -> 922.87s]  Cost them a 250. Alright. Alright. Okay. Okay. This one will work. I'm going to control these
[922.87s -> 931.30s]  guys. Alright. Here we go. And three. Don't get, what a bad camera angle. Alright. Lock it in.
[931.30s -> 945.53s]  Start. Shoot that one person. Good. That's guy right here. Good. This guy right here.
[946.09s -> 963.64s]  Again. In the head. Again. Okay. Good. Again. Again. Nice job. Alright. Round two is these
[963.64s -> 971.46s]  animals. I can't wait to make my own shit. This is going to be awesome. I'm going to do a dinosaur
[971.46s -> 976.68s]  fight like you've never seen before. Alright. It's versus, how many of us, what is it? Elephants,
[976.68s -> 986.49s]  hippos, giraffes. I kind of feel like the night would be well good here. Or just a shitload of
[986.49s -> 1019.74s]  these guys with the axes. 400 limit. Or just like 40 archers. Okay. Let's see what happens.
[1019.82s -> 1034.49s]  And three. Two. One. Go. Okay. Shoot. That way. Wait. What? Alright. Stop breaking up formation.
[1034.49s -> 1046.68s]  Get over here. How the fuck are you supposed to do this? This is impossible for humans to beat this.
[1047.78s -> 1065.91s]  This is actually impossible. Can I do weapons? Alright. I'm going to scatter around. We're going
[1065.91s -> 1078.30s]  to do the knights. We'll do like, okay, knights. One. Two. Like some over here. We'll do some
[1078.30s -> 1092.41s]  Spartan warriors over here. Right at the front. Okay. Archers are going to go back here. And then
[1092.41s -> 1097.14s]  I'm going to get some of these guys just to be right here. Just to get attacked. Okay. Let's try
[1097.14s -> 1129.26s]  that. It's kind of working. Fucking hippo. What happened to the hippo? This is so stupid. Okay.
[1129.26s -> 1144.42s]  That was dumb. But I got it. This one is aliens. Why did I say that so weird? Aliens? Bugs. Alright.
[1144.42s -> 1164.33s]  We're just going to load up a shitload of these. Watch out for these mutants. The mutant like
[1164.33s -> 1186.23s]  sucker things. Get them. Mom, we have tabs at home. I like this. This is cool. I think we're
[1186.23s -> 1207.27s]  going to do a phalanx or riot. Alright. I'll do a phalanx. There are dinosaurs. Alright. You know
[1207.27s -> 1226.22s]  what? You know what? I'm ready. I'm ready. Where should we go? Is it just green? Just small green.
[1226.22s -> 1236.36s]  Grassland. Time of day. It's going to be noon. Looks good. Victory condition is death match.
[1239.66s -> 1251.51s]  Uh, player army limits. Holy shit, dude. That's a lot. Pathfinding. Animals will move in a straight
[1251.51s -> 1266.07s]  line. Yeah, we'll do gambling. You guys can gamble on these. Wind effect. Amuro. Animal weapons and
[1266.07s -> 1277.58s]  armor. Alright. Alright. Let's go for it. This is the battle. Okay. Animal base. Holy shit, dude.
[1277.58s -> 1295.62s]  This just got so much more interesting. Alright. Unicreator. Let's do animal base. How about a
[1295.62s -> 1303.82s]  modern mammal? Alright. A rhinosaur. A rhinosaur body. What side are they on, by the way? Team one.
[1303.82s -> 1315.16s]  Okay. I want, I want it to be big. How do I make it big? AI mode. Detection distance multiplier. How
[1315.16s -> 1339.74s]  do I make it bigger? Can I make this thing bigger? Can I scale it up? How do I make it bigger?
[1339.74s -> 1352.54s]  Robotic base. Okay. A head. Wheel. It's the wheel. Wheel for scale. It doesn't work. Wheel? Wheel
[1352.54s -> 1369.69s]  just spins. Alt scroll wheel for scale. There we go. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Wonderful. Okay.
[1369.69s -> 1388.25s]  Now let's go back to body. Uh, how do I just select this guy? Or so. No, I don't need to
[1388.25s -> 1411.75s]  torso limbs. Alright. How about arms? These are huge. These are way too big. Okay. Shit, it's
[1411.75s -> 1426.90s]  backwards. Okay. Well, it's backwards, but whatever. Weapons. Decorations. Armor. Gear. Okay. That looks
[1426.90s -> 1444.79s]  alright. And this one looks good. Okay. That's team one. Now I want team two. Team two is going
[1444.79s -> 1453.24s]  to be animal base. This weird like frog thing. Animal scaling not recommended. Don't tell me what
[1453.24s -> 1514.25s]  to do. It's a giant alligator. Okay. And you need a head. Uh, okay. Head. Just messing around. Okay.
[1514.25s -> 1527.26s]  Plasma beam T-Rex. Okay. So that's, those are the two captains. So this, you're, on the right side,
[1527.26s -> 1556.49s]  we're going to have two brontosaurus and three tiny triceratops. That's team captain right there.
[1556.49s -> 1572.86s]  So now over here, let's do spiders and shit. Yeah. Alright. Two huge scorpions. It's got to be fair.
[1578.09s -> 1596.26s]  And then three polar bears. No. One moderately sized polar bear. I think that's good for now.
[1598.47s -> 1612.71s]  Alright. So you guys ready? Here's the first fight I want to do. See what happens. Team one or team
[1612.71s -> 1632.65s]  two. Give the big guys more HP. Oh, that's a good idea. That's true. How do I do that? Can I select
[1632.65s -> 1654.18s]  a unit? How do I select? Oh, let me just select the unit. Where are the bugs? Where are the bugs?
[1654.18s -> 1668.46s]  Okay. Emperor scorpion. Okay. So, but how do I, is this going to do it for the whole team?
[1668.46s -> 1679.88s]  Cancel bet. Why? What? AI mode default. HP multiplier. I don't think I can do anything
[1679.88s -> 1688.97s]  about it. It's before you place it. Oh, okay. So we'll do HP multiplier five for the big ones.
[1688.97s -> 1703.37s]  Okay. HP multiplier five, attack multiplier three. The big guys. I, I'm not, I'm not remaking these
[1703.37s -> 1714.79s]  guys. So that's too bad. We're just going to make a polar bear. HP multiplier five. All right.
[1714.79s -> 1721.06s]  Modern mammals. Okay. Polar bear. All right. It was a moderately size. It was, what was it? 1.1,
[1721.06s -> 1739.19s]  right? Doing two. It was 1.1. It was 1.1. What was it? 1.1 or 1.2? It was 1.1. That's fine.
[1740.70s -> 1760.42s]  All right. Now let's go over here. Let's change these guys. Five, three. Okay. Now I need the
[1760.42s -> 1782.26s]  three little triceratopsis. What were they? 0.3? 0.2 or 0.3? And these guys are going to be two
[1782.26s -> 1791.40s]  with attack multiplier one. Cause there's more of them. That's fair. It was 0.3. Okay. Oh,
[1791.40s -> 1801.46s]  fuck. This is the wrong team. Okay. Who will win? No refunds. You know what I'm doing. I'll get it
[1801.46s -> 1809.59s]  right. Team two. Team, I got team two. All right. Team two, team two, team two, team two. Five,
[1809.59s -> 1828.78s]  three. All right. Are you ready? All right. Team one. I want to show, I want to see team one.
[1828.78s -> 1854.89s]  Team two, team one. All right. Are you guys ready? In three, two, one. Action. Team one kind of
[1854.89s -> 1869.78s]  got, wait, hold on a minute. It's still a fight. Shit. This is so stupid. The polar bear died
[1869.78s -> 1876.81s]  instantly. Why? Oh wait, it's anybody's game right now. It's the scorpions versus the broncos
[1876.81s -> 1899.14s]  versus. Oh, team two wins. It wasn't even close. All right. How about this one? A tetrazyrus,
[1900.02s -> 1909.48s]  a gigantic tetrazyrus with attack multiplier of 10 and health multiplier of 10 versus
[1912.36s -> 1949.85s]  fucking 5,000 snakes. It's going to do one stomp. I don't think it's going to be one stomp.
[1949.85s -> 1965.14s]  Can I actually even fit 5,000 snakes on here? All right. It's starting to lag. Oh man. It's lagging.
[1965.22s -> 1980.98s]  3090 omega low. Oh fuck. I can't do anymore. We'll say three. I can't do that much more.
[1980.98s -> 2001.61s]  How about, how does 300 sound? I'm going to overheat the 3090. Okay. 300 snakes is enough.
[2001.61s -> 2009.72s]  Okay. I got to get the camera somewhere where I don't have to move it because I'm not going
[2009.72s -> 2027.27s]  to be able to. Okay. Here we go. Are you ready? Up there attack so it's fair. No, up there attack.
[2027.27s -> 2044.66s]  Why? One, two, three. Where are they going? Is he just stepping on them?
[2049.03s -> 2073.67s]  I can't tell who's winning. Are these all snake bodies? Some snakes are dead. I can't tell.
[2073.67s -> 2087.78s]  They're just like a plate of ramen. A potato computer. No, I don't have a potato computer.
[2088.50s -> 2105.75s]  My CPU. Oh God. My poor CPU. I see blood. He's too big for them to hit.
[2110.79s -> 2117.37s]  Oh, what an epic battle. Listen to this big drop incoming. I think he killed them.
[2121.48s -> 2125.32s]  I don't think this is going to, this is going to, yeah, this is going to take a long time.
[2128.14s -> 2151.77s]  He's not even attacking anything. Is nothing dying? Is there a fast forward? I smell smoke.
[2153.21s -> 2161.99s]  That's funny. They're pushing it towards the edge. Wait, no, they're running away.
[2162.63s -> 2172.06s]  I don't know what to do about this. Should we just call this one a draw?
[2180.55s -> 2193.69s]  No? What do you mean no? It's obviously not a draw. Yeah, well, no one's really winning either.
[2194.49s -> 2210.14s]  Although there is a big mess of snakes over there. They all died in the same spot.
[2210.14s -> 2231.64s]  But there's a shitload of movement though. Are those dead or alive? I think those are dead.
[2232.20s -> 2248.28s]  It's just a mat of hair from like the barber shop. Press H. H for health. Oh my fucking God.
[2248.28s -> 2258.33s]  This is going to take forever. They can't even like, it can't even hurt each other guys.
[2259.77s -> 2274.89s]  Refund. Refund. They can't even hurt each other. They can't hurt each other. It's refund. Refunded.
[2274.89s -> 2289.46s]  I can't end the battle. There we go. Okay. Good. Holy shit. All right. Delete all this crap.
[2289.46s -> 2306.44s]  Clear it. Clear it all. Okay. Wow. All right. That's better. Okay. Let's do another one.
[2306.44s -> 2314.15s]  How about, let's do something easy, right? Something simple. I'm thinking saltwater
[2314.15s -> 2325.05s]  crocodile. A little bit bigger than that. One, let's do 2.0 scale. HP, crocodile would have a
[2325.05s -> 2332.71s]  little bit more HP, I think. Let's go with five and then attack multiplier two. Slow. Versus Komodo
[2332.71s -> 2348.06s]  dragon. Komodo dragon would be a little bit less HP. I think it would hurt a little bit. Then we
[2348.06s -> 2366.98s]  hit a little harder. Okay. Who wins? Komodo dragon or alligator? You didn't apply the multipliers?
[2366.98s -> 2383.13s]  I thought I did. Didn't I? I didn't change the alligator. Alligator was five HP, but two attack.
[2383.13s -> 2400.54s]  2.0. Yeah. All right. Which one is which? Team two is the Komodo dragon. Rock one was one attack.
[2400.54s -> 2408.71s]  All right. Here we go. Three, two. Let's get a good view of this. I want like a fucking
[2408.71s -> 2433.85s]  national geographic view. Three, two, one. Go. Oh shit. Oh, the Komodo dragon's done for.
[2436.78s -> 2468.86s]  What? He won. Damn. Okay. All right. All right. Let's do, how about this? All right. How about,
[2468.86s -> 2478.14s]  okay. I'm going to make two different animals. Let's do humanoid. Okay. I want like human legs.
[2478.78s -> 2485.75s]  By the way, HP multiplier of three, attack multiplier of five. No, HP multiplier of 10.
[2485.75s -> 2502.22s]  Is it going to be kind of a human character? Big legs, strong, very quick, fast moving. Then
[2502.22s -> 2514.12s]  we need some torsos here. All right. Humanoid, humanoid torso. It's like plate armor. All right.
[2514.12s -> 2527.88s]  Carnivore plate armor. Okay. Uh, limbs. Let's go with wings. Yeah. Like these like big ass bat
[2527.88s -> 2555.30s]  wings. Okay. Oh, attack multiplier of one, three. Okay. Now let's do a tail. Tail's a little bit
[2555.30s -> 2571.53s]  weak. Attack multiplier of one is fine. Okay. Now let's do, uh, arms. Limbs. Let's do like a sword
[2571.53s -> 2594.97s]  hand. This one. Attack multiplier, by the way, this attack multiplier of five. And then I need
[2594.97s -> 2609.37s]  a shield hand. All right. Fine. I'll just take a little random like weird claw. Attack multiplier,
[2609.37s -> 2630.18s]  by the way, of zero. How are we going? Weapons. Isn't there a handgun? FPS weapons. Okay. Is it
[2630.18s -> 2641.99s]  going to be a handgun? Oh, a shotgun. That's, that's available over here, by the way. Two
[2641.99s -> 2662.84s]  shotguns are available to use. Fix the wings? What's wrong with the wings? Okay. This is,
[2662.84s -> 2680.73s]  okay. This is literally one of the monsters from Power Rangers. Big head. No, I don't want it to be
[2680.73s -> 2689.50s]  too big. Attack multiplier for the head is going to be two because there's going to be a bite. All
[2689.50s -> 2700.52s]  right. You're kind of a skexy. That's all right. I think this one's ready to go. Any other accessories
[2700.52s -> 2719.45s]  or armor? Oh my, can I put this on your head? No, I don't think I can. All right. I can give you this.
[2720.73s -> 2739.54s]  I have a trash can and you can have little knee pads too. Okay. Not bad. You look good. How about
[2739.54s -> 2777.34s]  gear? Decorations? Absolutely. Sunglasses? I don't think these are going to stay on. Okay.
[2777.34s -> 2792.34s]  What about hats? This is like a teen dinosaur and like a kid's cartoon. All right. That's it
[2792.34s -> 2803.40s]  for you. Good luck. I wish you the best of luck. Now we're going to go over here. Team two. Animal
[2803.40s -> 2820.44s]  base. Arnivorous dinosaur. Okay. Spin neuron. I'm going to do, I'm going to say two of these,
[2820.44s -> 2835.11s]  which then we'll give a torso. Okay. Let's do humanoid torso. Does this count as two people?
[2835.11s -> 2855.88s]  Or can I fuse them together? Okay. I can't, I can't fuse them together. All right. Hold on. Weapons
[2855.88s -> 2879.21s]  one. Okay. Better idea. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stand back up. Stand up. Oh God. All right. I'm
[2879.21s -> 2890.66s]  going to redo it. I just want a torso with like a thousand like murder tentacles. Animal base. All
[2890.66s -> 2908.33s]  right. Here we go. This is what I want. Okay. Good. Now we want torso. Humanoid. Back multiplier
[2908.33s -> 2932.02s]  of one. Okay. That looks good. Don't fall over. Is it going to fall over? Back multiplier of four
[2932.02s -> 2989.69s]  for these. Okay. This is fucking deranged. Why? Okay. All right. The head's going to be like a two.
[2995.64s -> 3005.61s]  That looks, it does not look good. That does not look okay. I definitely can't put the head here.
[3005.61s -> 3011.21s]  That's for sure. Cause I was thinking about that too. That was the place I was going to put it.
[3017.43s -> 3028.28s]  You can't do a snake. Okay. That's fine. I was the, is the elephant going to look just as bad?
[3031.83s -> 3041.83s]  You're so immature. I didn't do it. I just stated it was possible. That's fine. Okay. Now what about
[3041.83s -> 3069.93s]  weapons and shit? Decorations? Sparkles? We just have LEDs. Okay. God damn it. I'm fine. This got
[3069.93s -> 3100.04s]  so mad for no reason. Now he's going to go in the back. Are you ready to place your bets? Let's
[3100.04s -> 3110.60s]  remind everybody what team everybody's on. Team one is, I don't remember. I actually don't remember.
[3112.14s -> 3120.81s]  Team two is the cool radical dinosaur, I think. I don't remember. Nice third grade arts and crafts
[3120.81s -> 3130.26s]  project. Team one is left. Are you sure? That's wrong. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Team one is
[3130.26s -> 3142.46s]  the rad dino. Let me just make sure. All right. Yeah. Team one is rad dino. Team two is a serious
[3142.46s -> 3159.08s]  Sam torso guy. They both pretty evenly matched, I think. Team one is over here. Team two is over
[3159.08s -> 3181.46s]  here. All right. Are you guys ready? Get a good view. Pull it back a little. In three, two, one.
[3181.46s -> 3196.47s]  Let's go. Oh Jesus Christ. Oh, he got him down. He got him down. He got him down. He got him down.
[3198.02s -> 3208.38s]  He's got him down. Him on his back is bad. That's real bad. He's just stabbing him in the chest.
[3210.60s -> 3229.69s]  Oh no. One. Team two is the winner. That's close. Nobody picked up the shotguns. I mean he did get
[3229.69s -> 3237.90s]  stabbed with every spear tentacle in the head. Every single one landed in his head. It was over
[3237.90s -> 3252.49s]  from the very beginning. Okay. So you know how this works, right? Team two moves on. Team one is
[3252.49s -> 3267.94s]  eliminated. Now we bring in a new character. All right. How do you guys feel about... Let's
[3267.94s -> 3276.79s]  just see if we can... How about lava golem? What do you think? You think he's got what it takes
[3276.79s -> 3283.30s]  versus a fucking giant lava golem? What do you think? How confident are you in this?
[3283.30s -> 3304.46s]  HP at 10, attack multiplier five. That works. I wonder. He deserves upgrades if he wins? No,
[3304.46s -> 3321.24s]  I don't think so. Upgrade the winner. I don't think that's fair. That's J. Starting HP 20,000.
[3321.24s -> 3332.36s]  Holy shit. That's a lot. Okay. His HP multiplier has to be like eight. That's unfair. Okay. HP
[3332.36s -> 3346.14s]  multiplier of six, five. All right. It's a little bit of a challenge. What do you think?
[3346.14s -> 3359.67s]  Give the lava monster a gun. I would love to. I can't hand it to him. I can just put it in front
[3359.67s -> 3371.27s]  of him. The lava monster with a gun? All right. So you got team one. Lava monster with a weapon
[3371.27s -> 3386.34s]  available. Or you've got the one that won last time. Patch it? I don't think I can. Oh, they're
[3386.34s -> 3398.10s]  only for your FPS character. Yeah, we'll have the health bars on this whole time. Lava monster needs
[3398.10s -> 3436.25s]  a hat. That's true. Okay. All right. Good luck. In three. Hold on. Let me get a good view. I'm
[3436.25s -> 3447.82s]  going to keep the health bars on so it's not a mystery. Three, two, one, action. Oh shit. Not
[3447.82s -> 3456.44s]  looking good. He's got him up in the air though. Oh, he's on the ground. Bad. Oh, he tripped. He
[3456.44s -> 3459.72s]  tripped over him. He tripped over him. He's got him by the leg. He's got him by his leg. He's going
[3459.72s -> 3466.15s]  to get him up just because of the leg only. He's stuck in his foot. Oh shit. He's going to win.
[3466.79s -> 3475.82s]  That's going to be close. Oh, he actually beat him. No way. That was close. He got the tendril
[3475.82s -> 3491.72s]  stuck in his foot. I did not think he was going to win that. You're eliminated. You're out. Okay.
[3492.28s -> 3517.14s]  How about the knockout artist? Okay. How about King? King Kung? Okay. King? King? Uh, we know
[3517.14s -> 3529.94s]  we need an attack multiplier of HP multiplier of seven, attack multiplier of six. Okay. He needs
[3529.94s -> 3564.71s]  upgrades. The winner gets the loser's hat. That's a great idea. Add weapons. I can't for these guys.
[3564.71s -> 3590.98s]  No, I want sunglasses. I want a different hat too. Give me a crown. I like the Santa hat.
[3600.94s -> 3609.51s]  You already have a Santa hat. What a crown for the king. After this, if he wins three in a row,
[3609.51s -> 3619.37s]  he gets the crown. All right. It's time. You guys ready? Team one is the gorilla. Team two is uh,
[3619.93s -> 3632.66s]  I don't know. What do we name them? Guns and unit creator weapons too. Can they use these? Oh man.
[3632.66s -> 3646.62s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, not for this one. I'm not going to throw a flame throw on the chest right
[3646.62s -> 3663.72s]  now. No, not happening. Okay. You ready? Three, two, one, go. Well, that's a bad start. He can't
[3663.72s -> 3673.35s]  even walk. Holy shit. Oh no, he's going to drop him out of the arena. Wait a minute. Does that
[3673.35s -> 3681.46s]  count as a tie? Oh, I don't know who wins. Who won? Who won? Does that count as a tie?
[3684.82s -> 3696.50s]  It says I lost. So technically that's team two wins. It's a ring out. Oh God. Team one lost.
[3696.50s -> 3710.66s]  Yeah, it's a ring out. The monkey fell out first. That's uh, that we watched. It's a rematch.
[3710.66s -> 3718.20s]  All right, we'll do a rematch and I'll give it to you this way. Ready? This is what we'll do.
[3725.56s -> 3736.76s]  We'll prevent that from happening again. How confident are you now still
[3737.32s -> 3748.52s]  that the gorilla can take him on? Do you have confidence still? I'm not, I don't know. I'm
[3748.52s -> 3763.51s]  not so sure. You think these walls can hold them? Yeah, I do. What does it look like so far?
[3766.30s -> 3777.03s]  This is very skewed to team two. Do a cage match. We'll leave this for now. I'll do a cage match
[3777.03s -> 3795.45s]  later. Who will win? It's insanely skewed. This, look at the, look at how you, no confidence in
[3795.45s -> 3806.55s]  the gorilla at all. Even with the wall back there. This is, some of you guys have a chance to win
[3806.55s -> 3812.34s]  big right now and I mean big. Like really big. Because if this happens, holy shit,
[3812.34s -> 3819.53s]  some of you guys are going to get a major payout. Let's go. Three, two, wait, hold on,
[3819.53s -> 3830.22s]  it's still going. The gorilla sucks. I don't know. All it takes is one big punch to the face and
[3830.22s -> 3850.36s]  it's over. One, two, um. No, it's gonna happen again. He's gonna, no, he's gonna just fall out.
[3851.24s -> 3866.02s]  He's still in, he's still in. He's still in it. Oh my god, he sucks. Holy shit, he's bad.
[3866.58s -> 3874.66s]  He was really bad. Why is he, why can he not walk? Why does he have so much trouble moving? He was
[3874.66s -> 3882.87s]  trying to go for this double axe handle move and he couldn't even do it to anything. All right,
[3882.87s -> 3898.94s]  goodbye. He moves on again and this time he gets glasses. I don't know if anyone's gonna be able
[3898.94s -> 3918.74s]  to beat him. He seems like, it seems too good. I can't put these on. This looks like I'm at the
[3918.74s -> 3924.60s]  beach with my grandpa. They're just lying back in the lounge chair. We got here 10 minutes ago.
[3925.48s -> 3939.53s]  Just asleep already. And they wake up when it's time to leave. Those are team one glasses? Oh,
[3939.53s -> 3953.00s]  okay. Does that matter? All right, it's time for another, all right, this time I'm gonna create
[3953.00s -> 3956.60s]  something. We gotta, we have to rival this because he can't stick around this whole time.
[3956.60s -> 3991.86s]  This one's gonna have a weapon, but I'm gonna make it fair. How's, I don't know how this works.
[3991.86s -> 4030.81s]  Wrong team? Oh shit, okay. Attack multiplier, machine gun, attack power two, okay. Oh shit,
[4030.81s -> 4086.42s]  I needed to, whoops. Oh fuck it, it's gonna be just static on the ground. Anything else I wanna do?
[4086.42s -> 4109.38s]  Limbs? Okay, maybe he can fly. This can fly motherfucker, here let's go. So it doesn't do
[4109.38s -> 4125.91s]  that much damage but has a huge advantage. It can't walk, important to know. Press J.
[4127.32s -> 4135.56s]  Some attached weapons have attack multiplier not set to one. That's fine. Only a thousand starting
[4135.56s -> 4146.41s]  HP though? Oh, this is really, okay. Okay, so this thing has a thousand health, but will it just blow
[4146.41s -> 4161.83s]  this guy away in five seconds? Raises HP. I, can I even at this point? I don't know, I don't know.
[4161.83s -> 4171.59s]  I can't, it's too late. I already bet, that's where we're already in. Look, he, okay, this is
[4171.59s -> 4176.31s]  one of those scenarios where he's gonna surprise you and he's gonna die immediately. Or he has a
[4176.31s -> 4178.95s]  thousand health, he's gonna shoot in and miss like five times and he's gonna stab in the head
[4178.95s -> 4209.50s]  and die. Here we go, ready? Three, two, one, let's get a good view. Action. Oh my god! Wow,
[4210.30s -> 4220.86s]  did the Tesla coil even do anything? Look at the wings. He's gone and he gets to have his,
[4222.34s -> 4248.78s]  he had a funny hat on. Damn, I didn't, okay. All right, so he gets his hat. More guns?
[4248.78s -> 4258.58s]  All right, we need to, we need to, oh, that's team one, god damn it. Okay, how about,
[4260.02s -> 4267.16s]  we have to dethrone this guy. All right, animal base, liven. We're gonna do attack,
[4267.16s -> 4271.93s]  let's see, what is the attack multiplier? Starting HP 2000. Okay, we're gonna do,
[4271.93s -> 4282.49s]  this is gonna be tricky. HP multiplier, so he's gonna have, he's got 7,000 HP. Okay, no, you know
[4282.49s -> 4287.40s]  what? We'll have him have more HP. 8,000. Well, hold on, don't, who will win? You don't even know
[4287.40s -> 4306.87s]  who it is yet. Oh, wait, team two, okay. Why you, you don't even know who it is? Why are you voting?
[4306.87s -> 4314.38s]  Okay, wyvern body, we're gonna do with the intelligence of a fucking man. And I mean,
[4314.38s -> 4332.09s]  this is tricky, this is where it gets weird for you guys. This is gonna have human intelligence.
[4332.09s -> 4363.16s]  Take that off, it's too heavy. Okay, I don't know about this guy. Okay, oh, and what's that? Two
[4363.16s -> 4379.05s]  plasma beam T-Rexes on his, on his front that do two attack multiplier times two. And he's got a
[4379.05s -> 4386.52s]  flamethrower on his forehead. This thing, by the way, this shit does fucking 10 attack multiplier,
[4386.52s -> 4395.51s]  but it is really small. You gotta get in real fucking close for that one. And then we're gonna
[4395.51s -> 4436.06s]  give him, that's it, that's it. Team one is wyvern, team two is our champion. Tail? No, no tail.
[4441.66s -> 4445.10s]  I think you guys seriously underestimate the fact that he has a flamethrower on his head.
[4445.10s -> 4474.54s]  That is a times 10 attack multiplier. If he gets in close, it's over. Where's his hat? I can't put
[4474.54s -> 4480.63s]  that on him. Okay, that's the flamethrower. Yeah, that is the flamethrower. That's a good call. All
[4480.63s -> 4505.64s]  right, we ready? Good view. See all the action. Let's do it. Three, two, one, go. Okay, those are
[4505.64s -> 4511.40s]  strong. Those are really strong. Those are very strong. I don't even know where he's flying.
[4511.40s -> 4531.75s]  It's a victory lap. Okay, well, that was, here's your new hero. Down goes the giraffe. All right,
[4531.75s -> 4540.57s]  let's get another contender. Say goodbye. All right, team two. Let's see if he can handle one
[4540.57s -> 4557.78s]  of the, one of these. For instance, how about like gore hammer? Gore hammer. Attack HP multiplier of
[4557.78s -> 4574.84s]  10, attack multiplier of five. You think you can handle gore hammer? Team two is gore hammer,
[4574.84s -> 4591.16s]  team one. Let's take a look. That's pretty evenly matched. Gore hammer does not look that sturdy.
[4591.16s -> 4603.38s]  I will make sure that everybody watching is aware of this. Gore hammer may not actually be able to
[4603.38s -> 4620.87s]  move. Okay, gore needs ranged weapons, but we don't, you don't know that. I'm taking the odds
[4620.87s -> 4628.12s]  on this one. Good luck. Look, I hope he runs in there and just hits the hammer down and just kills
[4628.12s -> 4634.44s]  him with a headshot. All right, here we go. Actually, a lot of people are voting for it.
[4636.28s -> 4646.15s]  Not really though. All right, remember team two is the gorilla. Oh, that's the previous one. Oh,
[4646.15s -> 4662.74s]  okay. Ready? Three, two, one, go. He can only shoot those once. All he has to do is get the
[4662.74s -> 4678.87s]  hammer over there and hit him one time. He's flying away. He's flying away. I have to nerf this guy.
[4678.87s -> 4697.14s]  All right, well, it's not over yet. Okay, that was fucking pathetic. That was pathetic. That was
[4697.14s -> 4700.58s]  pathetic, but here we go. I'm going to do, I'm going to do you, uh, I'm going to, this is going
[4700.58s -> 4704.33s]  to make this really hard for you guys because I don't know what's going to happen. So I'm going
[4704.33s -> 4720.58s]  to make it really hard for you. Team two, HP multiplier of 10, attack multiplier of 10, two,
[4720.58s -> 4743.66s]  two 3.0 for the hammer with 10, 10 times 10. What do you think? If they can walk, it's going to be
[4743.66s -> 4765.53s]  very interesting. The two, the hammer brothers make a 1.0 hammer so he can actually move. I think
[4765.53s -> 4780.01s]  they'll be able to move 3.0. They were like 5.0 before. That's asking for a lot. We'll see. I
[4780.01s -> 4785.80s]  don't know what's going to happen if they can actually walk around this tall or this small.
[4785.80s -> 4794.66s]  And yeah, Wyvern has a problem. They're already shaking. I'm not telling you how to bet. I didn't
[4794.66s -> 4800.82s]  tell you what to bet on. I'm just here. I'm just them seeing this. I didn't tell you what was going
[4800.82s -> 4810.98s]  to happen. Imagine voting gorilla. I mean, if it ends up happening, somebody's going to, you guys
[4810.98s -> 4820.68s]  are going to, you're going to get a huge payday. Those are, those are more than 10 to one odds.
[4827.75s -> 4842.86s]  All right. Here we go. Good luck. 20 to one, three, two, one, go. He can fucking walk.
[4842.86s -> 4854.18s]  Interesting. Interesting. Oh my God. It's over. He literally fell down. Wow.
[4861.51s -> 4876.98s]  Wow. That's a payout. Team two wins. It took two hammer hits. 8.2 million versus 1.3 million.
[4876.98s -> 4888.52s]  All right. So this is going to be, uh, now we're going to do, so the two, these two are champions
[4888.52s -> 4894.89s]  with 10, 10 at 3.0. We know that, right? But let's make it a little harder. Let's do an actual like
[4894.89s -> 4904.39s]  battle sequence, right? We're going to do, uh, what's the, what's the default for these guys?
[4904.39s -> 4919.24s]  Just one, right? Werewolves. Let's do, what's this? What are the stats on you? Six 50, one, one. Okay.
[4919.24s -> 4937.42s]  Let's go like this. Werewolves. Let's do one, two, three. Actually, you know what? Let's do HP
[4937.42s -> 4965.03s]  multiplier times 10. 10 werewolves versus, oh shit, look at that. 10 werewolves, werewolves versus
[4965.77s -> 4979.30s]  most dangerous fucking animal in the world. Hippopotamus. What's their scaling? Okay. Look at
[4979.30s -> 5006.41s]  that. Versus five hippopotamus. Five hippopotamus versus 10 werewolves. Make it six. Five is too
[5006.41s -> 5022.58s]  much? I don't know, man. I don't think so. I think five is fair. Do three team to make it wacky. I
[5022.58s -> 5030.81s]  don't think you can do channel points that way. Do one horse sized duck versus one duck sized horse.
[5030.81s -> 5037.21s]  Isn't it a hundred duck sized horses? Team one is a werewolves. Team two is hippopotamus.
[5037.21s -> 5054.33s]  You just do a poll. Yeah, but people, there's no stakes. Okay. That was a quick vote. Here we go.
[5054.33s -> 5066.98s]  One, two, three. Oh shit. Oh, he took two with them though. They're dumping them. They're just
[5066.98s -> 5075.98s]  dumping off the edge. These werewolves, they're, they're smart. They're intelligent. Oh God.
[5076.62s -> 5084.87s]  Got a fight going on over there. No, they just dumped them. This is going to be close. This is
[5084.87s -> 5093.50s]  going to be close. He's taking three V1 and one V1 over there. What the fuck is he doing?
[5096.60s -> 5102.74s]  He just jumped off the cliff on his own. What a fucking moron. All right. Well, he's gone.
[5104.74s -> 5114.71s]  These two have to beat this hippo. Okay. Oh no. Fighting for his life on the edge.
[5116.74s -> 5119.62s]  One mistake though, when the hippo goes off. This is going to be anybody's game.
[5124.17s -> 5134.20s]  No, don't do it. Don't do it. Nice lunge. Oh, could the tables turn? Is he too heavy? I think he's
[5134.20s -> 5146.90s]  too heavy. I think the werewolves are doing more damage. Oh, so long King Bowser. Okay. This is
[5146.90s -> 5162.07s]  bad news for the werewolves. Oh no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't get cocky. Don't get cocky
[5162.07s -> 5173.53s]  hippos. Bad move. Get away from the edge. I'm telling you, he does more damage. They have to
[5173.61s -> 5177.05s]  throw him off. That was why they were doing that. The AI was like, we can't win. We got to throw
[5177.05s -> 5186.41s]  him off. He's just clinging, holding onto his leg and just biting his arm. Oh shit. This is bad.
[5190.22s -> 5205.98s]  Shit. Oh, he's going off. Yeah. He's getting gnawed on both arms and legs. It's over. It's not. He
[5205.98s -> 5224.90s]  can't come back from this. It's over. Wait, we've got some friendly fire here. Friendly fire. This
[5224.90s -> 5245.27s]  is so stupid. Last ditch effort. Oh, he's gone. Hippos win. Yeah. If the wolves did not just jump
[5245.27s -> 5257.06s]  off the edge for no reason, this would have ended a lot differently. Hippos win. All right. We need
[5257.06s -> 5263.70s]  to do, we got to put them in a, like we got to block, we got to lock them in. Okay. We got to
[5263.70s -> 5290.36s]  lock them in. Fences. Wait, I can make houses? I can make a castle? Wait, what? I put a hippo in a
[5290.36s -> 5323.00s]  castle and then have like a bunch of people try to conquer it? Oh, that's not going to work.
[5323.00s -> 5337.24s]  I think the team's tiny. Actually, I could probably do it. Do a tower. Okay. Yeah. So,
[5337.24s -> 5341.45s]  okay. We're going to put a hippo up here. All right. Hippo is going to go up here.
[5341.45s -> 5370.70s]  Okay. One single hippo. Oh yeah. Easy. Easy. Two hippos versus, how about like, I don't know, like
[5371.74s -> 5386.90s]  humans? Commando bow. Okay. Versus a bunch of commandos. There's a bunch of tiny commandos.
[5386.90s -> 5425.69s]  How about like 500 little tiny commandos? What about your CPU? I'll be all right. Okay. Nevermind.
[5425.69s -> 5465.34s]  Two, 250 tiny commandos. Okay. Just kidding. 200 tiny commandos. Okay. Around 200 tiny commandos.
[5465.34s -> 5472.18s]  Okay. They have 1500 HP. Their attack multiplier is one. All right. They have to storm the castle.
[5472.18s -> 5501.16s]  Good luck. PowerPoint Andy. Give the castle a mortar. No, no. I don't think so. Teams are
[5501.16s -> 5517.32s]  backwards. Oh shit. Team one is, oh shit. Team two of the commandos, by the way. Yeah. Team two of
[5517.32s -> 5545.99s]  commandos. Team one of hippos. Give the hippos crowns. Absolutely. Okay. And then I want my FPS
[5545.99s -> 5563.98s]  avatar up here too. No, actually that's not going to work because I have to die. All right. Let's
[5563.98s -> 5602.55s]  do it. Are we ready? Are we good? Are we ready? All right. Three, two, one. The commandos,
[5602.63s -> 5613.06s]  it's, it wasn't attached. They're not going to be able to get in here.
[5621.80s -> 5636.86s]  They alive? They're in there. Yeah. They're stuck in here. They're slowly getting in. They're slowly
[5636.86s -> 5653.26s]  getting out. They're getting out. They're getting out. They're getting out. Oh my god. Well, that
[5653.26s -> 5661.30s]  didn't work. Commandos win. Okay. Well, I think I screwed that up a little bit, but whatever.
[5661.30s -> 5688.79s]  Now I got to clear this whole thing. Clear it. Clear it. How do I clear this? Clear it. Set wind.
[5688.79s -> 5701.72s]  Hold on. New landscape. Okay. Yeah. All right. Coward coal. Can 10 coward coals beat one angry
[5701.72s -> 5727.03s]  Joe? We're doing defaults. Team one. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[5727.03s -> 5753.70s]  Just one single angry Joe on team two. What do you think? Four hours? Four hours. What do you mean
[5753.70s -> 5773.34s]  four hours? Oh, and by the way, did I mention angry Joe has a fucking helmet on? Um, never mind.
[5773.34s -> 5810.22s]  All right. It worked. Angry Joe versus 10 cowards. I don't think the cowards even fight, if I'm honest.
[5810.22s -> 5820.52s]  Cowards have a shield wall though. That's, you're right. They do. Yes. Left team. The coward is team
[5820.52s -> 5833.94s]  one. Joe with the bad is team two. They could push him off. That's true. He's in a really
[5833.94s -> 5849.06s]  vulnerable position. All right. Here we go. Three, two, one, go. Uh, the cowards don't even fight.
[5856.65s -> 5890.78s]  Although, very important, he might walk him off the cliff. He fucking fell. You're really
[5890.78s -> 5903.10s]  hoping for. He falls off the edge here. Uh, it's still possible. Uh oh. Big trip incoming.
[5905.46s -> 5925.13s]  He has to do this 10 times. I know. Oh shit. No, not enough. It wasn't enough. One slip up though
[5925.13s -> 5948.34s]  and that's it. Nobody can, they can't even attack with their umbrellas. This is an easy win. Hold on.
[5948.34s -> 5966.95s]  Don't just say that. It's still time. It's still time for a monumental mistake. This is a real
[5966.95s -> 5983.38s]  tragedy for the coward crew. Hold on. No, it's over. This is just slaughter. This is just
[5983.38s -> 6002.89s]  slaughter. What was the point of this fight? Uh, it was to see if 10 people could fight this guy and
[6002.89s -> 6012.65s]  win, but they don't even fight. And I can't stop it because money is on the line. Channel point money
[6012.65s -> 6017.29s]  is on the line. And if there was even a 1% chance that he trips and falls over the edge, I can't
[6017.29s -> 6043.00s]  stop it. Oh, nope. There was your, that's the last opportunity. Go wins. All right, new fight.
[6043.00s -> 6068.76s]  This time let's do, let's do another hard one. We're going to do berserker gorillas. How about,
[6068.76s -> 6080.20s]  you know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight berserkers, 1.5 scaled knockout
[6080.20s -> 6095.02s]  artist gorillas. Two of them. 2.0, Wolver, Wolver, Wolverilla, and Goro the Giant. By the way, at,
[6095.02s -> 6114.92s]  at 3.0. Can you not stand up? Okay. Wait. And you're going to be 10, you're going to be 5 HP,
[6115.72s -> 6130.15s]  two multiplier. Holy shit. He is fucking insane. Nevermind. That's too much. Okay. That's better.
[6132.95s -> 6145.02s]  Uh, we lost Wolverilla was 2.0, right? At default 2.0 Wolverilla. You stand over here. All right.
[6145.02s -> 6156.14s]  That's team gorilla, team one. So team two. Um, I'm going to throw you a curve ball here.
[6160.58s -> 6176.07s]  Bugs versus a bunch of bugs. Way more bugs. Giant praying mantis and a shitload of spiders.
[6176.07s -> 6187.78s]  Okay. Praying mantis at 2.0. I'm going to have to give you more multiplier there. Let's go to
[6187.78s -> 6195.96s]  one more. Let's do three. The two attack multiplier. And yeah, we'll do, no, no, no.
[6195.96s -> 6208.50s]  You know what? Fuck that. How about one, five, five, giant enemy spider. No, 20. Good luck.
[6208.50s -> 6224.82s]  And then a shitload of little praying mantises at default. Two, three, four, five, six.
[6224.82s -> 6231.26s]  Why are they moving? Why are you moving? Stop moving. What are they moving for?
[6231.26s -> 6245.27s]  Why are they moving? Stop moving. Okay. Well, whatever. Six praying mantises and are they
[6245.27s -> 6258.15s]  attacking? And then a bunch of little ants. I don't know why they, why are they attacking?
[6258.15s -> 6268.49s]  Are they, they're too small? Oh, okay. Hold on. Let me fix this. All right. One medium size
[6268.49s -> 6300.84s]  giant praying mantis and then wrong team. Shit. Did I say one? I meant two. And then a shitload
[6300.84s -> 6313.64s]  of ants. Tiny. We're talking like 0.2. We're talking like 50 of them. 30 is fine. All right.
[6313.64s -> 6322.34s]  The spider is insane. No, they're on the right team. Although look at this guy though. I don't
[6322.34s -> 6349.26s]  know. And one worm all the way back. The one giant worm, two giant worms and an extra gorilla. Get
[6349.26s -> 6365.11s]  ready. I'm excited for this one. I don't know. I don't want to influence the vote, but I have
[6365.11s -> 6379.45s]  what I would pick. I think we have to stay high up for this one. I don't think I can do very much
[6379.45s -> 6392.46s]  camera work on this. Wow. All right. I was going to say gorilla because we don't know if he throws
[6392.46s -> 6399.48s]  things or not. He might like throw rocks. I don't know. Three, two, one, begin.
[6404.94s -> 6416.10s]  What the fuck are you doing? What was he attacking that guy? All right. I don't understand.
[6417.62s -> 6422.98s]  They're too big. I think the spiders won, but what happened? Was he on the wrong team?
[6423.62s -> 6434.89s]  Was he on the wrong team? No, he's on the right team. He just started swinging at him and slashing
[6434.89s -> 6454.46s]  at him. Scimitar guy pulled an ant up. Oh, okay. All right. We're going to try this again with a
[6454.46s -> 6468.22s]  more dialed back gorilla or the giant. 2.0. 2.0. Giant enemy, giant enemy spider is going to go to
[6468.22s -> 6494.36s]  also to 2.0. No huge shit. It's impossible. No, 3.0. I can do 3.5. 4.0. 3.5. Wait, wait, wait,
[6494.52s -> 6516.26s]  wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Good. That means I got a team. God damn one. 2.0. Spin him around
[6516.26s -> 6526.89s]  and I want him 10, 10. No, he's got 42 fucking thousand HP. No, let's do four, four. Still way
[6526.89s -> 6535.83s]  too much. Two, 84. Okay. Two attack multiplier of two. All right. Now we can actually do it for real
[6535.83s -> 6554.47s]  this time. Ready? You guys ready to vote? Show stats. I think it's pretty evenly matched considering
[6554.47s -> 6564.01s]  that the bugs do more damage, but the giant enemy spider is way less powerful than Goro.
[6564.01s -> 6586.55s]  Let's see. The answer on the right team. Look at the circles. Three, two, one, action.
[6589.19s -> 6597.06s]  It is a pull. Okay. Now I understand what happened. All right. Looking good. Just the little bugs.
[6597.06s -> 6604.07s]  Don't walk off the edge. Giant enemy spider is currently attacking two gorillas. We still,
[6604.07s -> 6612.71s]  look, it's still plenty of game left. Scimitar is still alive. So is Goro the giant. I, this is
[6612.71s -> 6619.62s]  Goro's game to win right here, I think. No, they instantly killed him. The bugs win. Fuck. That
[6619.62s -> 6624.28s]  wasn't even close. Oh, he's doing like the Peter Griffin family guy thing when a family guy character
[6624.28s -> 6635.67s]  falls down. Okay. That was, that was embarrassing how bad that was. They lost very, very, very, very
[6635.67s -> 6672.55s]  badly. Can you last versus two? 10, 10. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How's that?
[6673.11s -> 6690.17s]  Good luck. Two, 10, 10. They're Resinosaurus. 12,000? Yeah. It says 12,000, doesn't it?
[6690.17s -> 6700.73s]  I don't know if the bird sounds. I, I can't, oh, I just realized what you're talking about.
[6700.73s -> 6725.18s]  Oh, and by the way, did you notice? It's really fucking windy out. It's rigged. All right. Wait,
[6725.18s -> 6728.54s]  wait, wait. I'll turn, all right. Not, not for this one. For the next one. You're right. That's,
[6728.54s -> 6733.67s]  that's just like, you're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, oh,
[6733.67s -> 6766.25s]  not yet. I can't turn the bird sounds off. One, two, two and a half. And you guys were concerned
[6766.25s -> 6792.44s]  about that. One of them's already dead. Okay. Bugs win. I would be shocked if they won again.
[6792.44s -> 6847.32s]  I'm just going to be very clear. And 250 angry Joes, which by the way, by the way, one of them,
[6847.32s -> 6853.24s]  captain, he's covered in fucking armor, surrounded with armor and he's going to have guns and weapons
[6853.24s -> 6881.75s]  all over him. He's getting into the hockey pads. It was like, he can play with like his big brother.
[6882.23s -> 6945.30s]  The Legion of angry Joes with one angry Joe dialed up to a thousand or a couple of bugs.
[6945.30s -> 6957.27s]  Oh, we are the gal here in friend tree. We're the ones that stomp on those bugs and camaraderie.
[6957.27s -> 7007.16s]  Captain needs a hat. We're ready. That's in three, two, one. Oh shit. One of them went flying.
[7007.16s -> 7031.38s]  Holy shit. What? I don't even know what they're attacking. One of them is getting shot with the
[7031.38s -> 7038.39s]  machine gun multiple fucking times. He's lighting up. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.
[7039.11s -> 7075.08s]  It's a fucking rave. What are they fighting? There's nothing even fighting each other.
[7075.08s -> 7095.98s]  Are they trying to hit the bugs on the ground? Oh shit. They're going to make it. Oh fuck. Here
[7095.98s -> 7105.61s]  they come. All right. This is there. There's a guy right now going like this, like way in the back.
[7106.33s -> 7129.70s]  There's a guy. She's like fucking freaking out over there. Wait, what happened? They won. There's
[7129.70s -> 7133.70s]  something. The doors like bending down too. You know, like it's always just like, it's like
[7138.30s -> 7149.99s]  their hair is like going fucking crazy. That person's having a good time. A really good time.
[7149.99s -> 7160.82s]  Fire the cameraman. All right. Here we go. All right. We'll do.
[7161.54s -> 7187.43s]  You got instantly overcrowded. This is too many. All right. Let's get rid of the dance guy angry
[7187.43s -> 7192.44s]  Joe's versus commandos. All right. Oh yeah. That's a good, that's a good one. Or how about
[7192.44s -> 7217.05s]  like just a, okay. 15 commandos versus 250 Joe's. Wrong team. God damn it.
[7239.61s -> 7267.27s]  Okay. And we'll give them a, like a fence or something to hide behind. Attic. Wait,
[7267.27s -> 7279.96s]  are these turnstiles? Hold on. I can make them have to go through turnstiles? No. Wind on.
[7279.96s -> 7309.98s]  Enough of this one. Hold on. It's fucking good enough. Whatever. Okay. Now we're going to put
[7309.98s -> 7322.63s]  mines where the mines missile launcher. Are there mines? Yeah. Then land mines. Okay.
[7334.73s -> 7338.09s]  This is quite a bet I would be making. I don't know if I don't know if I would make any of these
[7338.09s -> 7346.54s]  bets. I would, I'm going to say right now that I don't, I would not vote for the angry Joe's.
[7346.54s -> 7369.14s]  Okay. I'll make it a little better. Okay. There I would not vote for the angry Joe's. This is a
[7369.14s -> 7378.82s]  tough one. Let me make it easier for you. Let me make it harder. Actually. Now it's actually a hard
[7378.82s -> 7391.77s]  decision and we're going to remove this wall here. Go easy. All right. Let's see. Put your money where
[7391.77s -> 7414.09s]  your mouth is then. Team two is commando. Team one is angry Joe. There's way too many Joe's.
[7414.09s -> 7421.29s]  I don't know, man. We've seen countless things so far. We've seen things that looked impossible to
[7421.29s -> 7433.62s]  fight die instantly. This is a toss up for me. I don't know. On one hand, are they going to get
[7433.62s -> 7438.26s]  overwhelmed by the Joe's or on the second hand are all the mines going to blow up and kill everybody
[7438.26s -> 7441.46s]  and there's going to be one commando left just sniping all the Joe's running around.
[7449.14s -> 7470.38s]  In three, two, one, go. Oh no. They're going to hit the other one. The bodies are in the way.
[7470.38s -> 7476.94s]  This is fucking heinous. They can't move because there's too many bodies. Holy shit.
[7488.68s -> 7502.89s]  What's with the gas? That was fucking horrible. They just started turning into cement. Human cement.
[7504.98s -> 7512.09s]  Oh yeah. Okay. Well, there were too many Joe's. If they weren't that many Joe's, it probably would
[7512.09s -> 7527.18s]  have been a little bit closer. Wall of flesh. All right. We're going to get rid of the fucking
[7527.18s -> 7532.28s]  landmines are not fair. Let's just be real. We're going to get rid of the landmines. We're going to
[7532.28s -> 7539.08s]  keep one landmine right here. We're going to get rid of a bunch of the Joe's and we're going to make
[7539.08s -> 7569.51s]  one big Joe. One large Joe who has a two and a two. You ready? No, he needs way more help than that.
[7569.51s -> 7579.16s]  Times 20 fucking health multiplier. Times 50 health multiplier. Let's put him far away though.
[7579.16s -> 7588.22s]  All right. He's got 10 fucking thousand health. All right. Let's go. Team one is Joe's. Team two
[7588.22s -> 7601.82s]  are the commandos. This is too easy now. Well, we'll find out. I have removed a bunch of the Joe's.
[7604.73s -> 7630.97s]  Team one Joe, team two commandos. I believe in big Joe. I believe in mega Joe. All right. Here we go.
[7630.97s -> 7643.77s]  What happens? Three, two, one. Lock the camera. Go. Well, he slipped. There's an extra mine over
[7643.77s -> 7657.91s]  there, but it's okay. It wasn't that bad. Oh, they're reloading. What's with the gas? What the fuck
[7657.91s -> 7675.75s]  just happened? What? Wait, what? What happened? What was the gas? They can't get through. Dude,
[7675.75s -> 7679.99s]  I'm telling you, if that angry Joe gets over here, it's over. Are they even hitting anybody?
[7680.79s -> 7698.97s]  How did they get out? Do not spread out. Are you stupid? Oh, gosh. They're all stuck.
[7699.61s -> 7703.37s]  There's too many Joe's again. There's too many dead bodies. He is flopping over here
[7703.37s -> 7713.74s]  very slowly. He gets over here, man. It's going to be trouble. Well, they're all dead. Okay. Well,
[7713.74s -> 7734.01s]  whatever. Sorry for all the Joe believers. There was an extra landmine. I'm going to delete that
[7734.01s -> 7750.26s]  one and delete that one. And we're going to get rid of the fence there. But to make up for it,
[7750.26s -> 7835.75s]  they get one of these. That's not going to work. Let's make it fair. Wrong team. It's going to
[7835.75s -> 7848.86s]  disaster. They're very vulnerable, but they have a ton of firepower. And we're also going to,
[7848.86s -> 7859.70s]  I'm going to remove another like 10 to 20 of them. They stopped getting all bunched up. All right.
[7859.70s -> 7865.22s]  Begin the vote. Team two versus team one. You've seen how it plays out. I think we're ready to go.
[7865.86s -> 7882.89s]  There's no way that big Joe is going to be able to move. I think he can.
[7882.89s -> 7901.13s]  Does it look like pretty even actually. If I had a vote right now, I'm putting it on the commandos.
[7901.13s -> 7908.41s]  I'm just going to give you honesty here. They have machine guns and they have blisters on their head.
[7908.41s -> 7939.34s]  Three, two, one, go. Uh-oh. Oh, shit. Oh, the gas. The flamethrower instantly killed them.
[7939.42s -> 8003.32s]  Damn. I would have lost. Fire is OP. Yeah. I was sleeping. I think the commandos just do the gas.
[8019.74s -> 8046.78s]  Oh shit. Big Joe, big Joe almost out. Stupid as shit ever. All right. One, I'll do one more.
[8046.78s -> 8051.02s]  One duck sized Joe versus one horse sized, a hundred horse sized ducks, whatever it is.
[8053.93s -> 8063.38s]  One duck sized tiger versus a hundred horse sized. I don't know. Get this turned off.
[8072.07s -> 8093.62s]  Okay. One duck sized, one horse sized boar versus a hundred duck sized buffalo.
[8136.78s -> 8147.16s]  Worst noise runner up. That's fine. I was trying to do a 56K modem. That's what it
[8147.16s -> 8150.52s]  started. That sounded like that for a couple of seconds and I was like, well,
[8150.52s -> 8158.26s]  fuck it. I'm just going to just really commit to this. All right. Here we go.
[8158.26s -> 8196.41s]  Can they wait? Can they walk? Okay. Well, that was fun. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'll see you
[8196.41s -> 8202.26s]  guys tomorrow. We're going to play the pawn shop game tomorrow. We're going to play, uh,
[8202.26s -> 8209.32s]  no umbrellas allowed. It's a game where you have to like haggle, sell things, buy things.
[8209.32s -> 8235.18s]  It looks really fun. I'll do one more. One more climactic one. Sure. This is going to be the final
[8235.18s -> 8280.76s]  time for you to bet as well. Drop sticks. I know. I'll get them. Wrong fucking team. No, it's not.
[8280.76s -> 8329.78s]  Right team. Okay. Who do you think went to increase their health? Oh, whatever. Hippo is
[8329.78s -> 8354.47s]  two OP. I'll change that. Here we go. Yeah. One more vote. I'm sitting there like, all right,
[8354.47s -> 8375.66s]  let's go. It's just a sci-fi channel original. But what if, what if the polar bear had a missile
[8375.66s -> 8390.81s]  launcher? It's like, uh, like Pixar movies from like 2001. But what if we made the claws of the
[8390.81s -> 8406.07s]  polar bear three inches longer? Then it would kill the hippo. Yeah. Isn't that weird? Not really.
[8406.07s -> 8429.37s]  Three, two, one, go. It's not even a contest. Oh my God. Sci-fi channel original.
[8437.54s -> 8450.94s]  Oh, that was my biggest bet of the night. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm going to go. Okay. That's it.
[8450.94s -> 8458.76s]  I'm done. But what if we do this? But what if we give the same exact machine gun that we gave the
[8458.76s -> 8467.40s]  hippo to the polar bear? Would the polar bear's aerodynamic way of moving prevent the hippo's
[8467.40s -> 8475.18s]  slow and coordinated movement from being shot? Let's put it inside of our simulator.
[8480.34s -> 8486.84s]  Stay tuned for Kathy Mitchell's copper pan infomercial because this is absolutely airing
[8487.72s -> 8504.23s]  at 3 a.m. Are we betting on this one? Keep stalling. I got to get more points.
[8508.55s -> 8518.95s]  Don't call Aaron at 3 a.m. No, it would be, we don't call Armin at 3 a.m. That's Armin saying
[8518.95s -> 8524.81s]  Aaron. So like it would be you call Armin and Armin thinks it's Aaron calling and it gets it
[8524.81s -> 8546.31s]  like really concerned. You've got that bit wrong. All right. Three, two, one, go. It's not even
[8546.31s -> 8553.88s]  fucking close. It was close. It was actually kind of close. All right. I'm out of here. Goodbye.
[8553.88s -> 8560.20s]  I'm going to get chopsticks in a second. I mean, what the fuck? Wait, why did he win that one?
[8560.20s -> 8567.34s]  Why did he win that one? What? Holy shit. He's winning them now. I didn't do anything different.
[8567.34s -> 8576.60s]  I just pressed the button. No, no, there's no more betting. There's no more. Maybe too late.
[8576.60s -> 8605.21s]  What? No, we're not betting anymore. Too late. Already did it. Already bet. What? I'm leaving.
[8605.21s -> 8616.98s]  I'm done. You guys were betting? No, no more betting. No, refund, refund, refund, refund.
[8616.98s -> 8624.15s]  I'm not even playing. All right. I'm going to beer up. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to get
[8624.15s -> 8631.56s]  the chopsticks, prove that I can use them, give them times 5,000 HP. I can't even do that right
[8631.56s -> 8640.78s]  now. We're going to make this fair. We're going to make this absolutely completely fair. We are
[8640.78s -> 8647.24s]  going to do hippopotamus. This is the last bet of the night. I make it fucking count. We're going
[8647.24s -> 8660.34s]  to do a 4.0 hippopotamus at times 100 multiplier health, more times a thousand multiplier health,
[8660.34s -> 8670.89s]  which would give this 900,000 health. And then our polar bear is also going to be the same size.
[8672.20s -> 8681.45s]  Was it 4.0? Same distance. Exactly. Different team. Let me redo this because people are going
[8681.45s -> 8692.02s]  to get confused. 4.0 polar bear. 500,000 HP. We have to do a little bit more than that.
[8693.54s -> 8710.39s]  So he has a million health in the hippopotamus. Team two, 4.0. Although that's not fair. 3.5.
[8710.39s -> 8716.82s]  Same distance. Separate team. You've got 1.8 million health. That's not fair. We're going to do
[8716.82s -> 8725.98s]  1100. Now they both have just about, there's a small disadvantage. They're just about a million
[8725.98s -> 8795.96s]  health each. Plasma. We're going to do missile launchers. You like that strategy? Okay. So that's
[8797.90s -> 8806.71s]  mega, mega, mega. That's mega. Mega what? I don't think that's just so powerful just yet.
[8806.71s -> 8899.38s]  Fence him in. It's a good boy. Barnacles. Team fucking one for the love of God. Okay. And then
[8900.86s -> 8976.54s]  rockets. A ton of them. I gotta redo it. Shit. The hippo looks actually stronger.
[8976.54s -> 8989.78s]  Okay. Fence. I need fences. So our mechanical gigantic monster fight. Let's do with a fence.
[8989.78s -> 9034.33s]  Okay. Fence. Static. Can't be moved. It has to be fucking huge. Okay. Team one. You know who it is.
[9034.33s -> 9042.74s]  Polar bear. More missile and plasma oriented. Team two is the hippo. Heavy machine gun fire
[9042.74s -> 9063.06s]  and light cruise missiles. Get a good view. I think right here looks about good. Right about
[9063.06s -> 9088.25s]  there. Looks good to me. So this is it. Hippo is two. Right. Hippo is two. Polar bear is one.
[9088.25s -> 9123.10s]  And three, two, one. He didn't fall out. He's still in. Oh my God. He's done. It's over.
[9123.74s -> 9145.70s]  He's done. He's not getting out of that. They didn't even scratch each other. Oh my God. Well,
[9145.70s -> 9154.57s]  that was insane. That was crazy. I'm gonna go get chopsticks. That's the end of the stream pretty
[9154.57s -> 9160.66s]  much. I will close the stream out. We'll see you tomorrow for the pawn shop game. Seems like a chill
[9160.66s -> 9166.47s]  fun game to experience. So see you tomorrow. Same time. 2 p.m. Pacific. I'll be right back.
[9266.62s -> 9294.46s]  I've got my bowl. By the way, this is going to be difficult because I got little carrots that are
[9294.46s -> 9302.92s]  wet and slippery. So if I can pick these up, then you know I know what I'm doing. Let me just exit
[9302.92s -> 9317.40s]  the game and quit the game. They're little baby carrots and they're wet and they're very slippery.
[9317.40s -> 9339.13s]  So let me come back. I'm gonna turn the exposure up. Okay, there we go. Okay, hi. Let's move you
[9339.13s -> 9347.05s]  over here. So just wanted to show everybody I've got a bowl with carrots in it and I've got
[9347.05s -> 9355.32s]  chopsticks. So as you can see, let's just go ahead and get one of these carrots. It's very simple.
[9355.32s -> 9367.27s]  It's very easy as you see. And these are slip. Oh, there's probably hair on it. There's probably
[9367.27s -> 9383.38s]  hair on it. They're slippery. There's probably hair on that because like I have like Otto has hair.
[9383.38s -> 9391.82s]  They're really slippery. But you get the idea. If this was a piece of sushi, I'd be fine.
[9391.82s -> 9416.07s]  I win. What do you mean fraud? What are you talking about? See you tomorrow. Off camera
[9416.07s -> 9424.33s]  chopstick double. I told you I could use them. What do you think I am? These are good. They were
[9424.33s -> 9435.05s]  a shitload of subs today and I missed a bunch of them. I missed almost all of them. Carrots are
[9435.05s -> 9445.11s]  really hard to eat. They take forever. But pawn shop game tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Next week,
[9445.11s -> 9450.60s]  we're going to do Sims 3 Mod Hell and Delta Rune. I'm not going to play it tomorrow. I'm going to
[9450.60s -> 9455.96s]  play chapter one on my own time to refresh my brain. But we'll see you tomorrow maybe.
[9455.96s -> 9472.50s]  Carrots take, oh no, carrots take so fucking long to eat. There we go. I got through them.
[9477.93s -> 9483.64s]  Yeah. I want to, how long is it? Okay. So now that it's out, I have a question. So now that
[9483.64s -> 9489.86s]  Delta Rune is out, it came out like three or four hours ago. Has anybody beaten it? How long is it?
[9489.86s -> 9495.58s]  Do we know? Like have people completed it? I know it just came out like three or four hours ago. But
[9495.58s -> 9507.56s]  I'm just kind of, I'm trying to figure out how long the chapter is. Is it less than six hours?
[9507.56s -> 9535.72s]  I have not yet. I'm not sure. Probably like four hours based off the last one. Okay. Four to five
[9535.72s -> 9549.50s]  hours. Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah. Let's raid somebody. Let's throw a raid out there. I haven't
[9549.50s -> 9557.98s]  raided somebody in like three weeks. So let's raid. Who's live? Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[9559.26s -> 9565.80s]  Vinny playing Cyberpunk 2077. Do people still play that game? Vinny, Vinny, Vinny. Let's go
[9565.80s -> 9589.06s]  say hi to Vinny. What, people still play Cyberpunk? Did they update it? I played Cyberpunk today.
[9589.06s -> 9600.23s]  I did not play Cyberpunk today. All right. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Go say hi to Vinny.
[9600.23s -> 9667.35s]  Take care of yourselves. Goodbye. Good night. See you later.
