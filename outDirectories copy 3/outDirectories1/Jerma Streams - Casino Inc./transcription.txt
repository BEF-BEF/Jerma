[636.67s -> 642.11s]  Your ultimate aim is to dominate the gambling and entertainment markets and to put two of the three major competitor casinos out of business
[642.43s -> 647.55s]  In addition to building an efficient business empire, you will need to use cheats troublemakers and hitmen
[648.33s -> 660.51s]  Exclusively extensively to harm your opponents. This is why they like command points the challenge in fortune falls shouldn't be underestimated

[900.94s -> 908.22s]  Carrying advertising for delights found elsewhere in the city. However, we believe this quieter establishment could wasteland

[916.91s -> 920.03s]  why
[920.03s -> 925.05s]  The crypt to the south of this casino. These are all the ones you were gonna pick

[13221.96s -> 13223.16s]  cheaters
[13223.16s -> 13225.16s]  This bouncer I think I believe has been pretty good
[13225.88s -> 13230.30s]  There's only two there's three bouncers
[13230.70s -> 13232.38s]  This one's got to go
[13232.38s -> 13238.78s]  All the servers where are you located?
[13240.49s -> 13242.33s]  I think it's time
[13242.33s -> 13245.05s]  Yeah, we it's time to liquidate these nobody. You know, nobody cares
[13247.69s -> 13250.89s]  Look at the profit on these
[13250.89s -> 13256.81s]  These have made a i've been i've been streaming for three and a half hours these went up at least two guys some loot
[13257.45s -> 13264.83s]  These went up probably two and a half hours ago. They've made a hundred dollars. They've made less than three hundred four hundred dollars total
[13266.89s -> 13268.25s]  It's time for them to go
[13268.25s -> 13277.71s]  Let's see
[13277.71s -> 13287.69s]  Where's the food?
[13287.69s -> 13289.56s]  food kiosks
[13289.56s -> 13292.52s]  Six fucking dollars these things made four dollars
[13294.30s -> 13298.20s]  Or six. Yeah, goodbye
[13298.20s -> 13300.20s]  Make the prop the price is reasonable
[13300.76s -> 13304.76s]  I've been always buying them
[13304.76s -> 13306.76s]  This shit is five bucks
[13306.92s -> 13308.92s]  For a good quality hamburger
[13310.04s -> 13312.04s]  Fire at the cheetah casino again
[13314.36s -> 13316.36s]  I'm getting rid of them. I'm gonna put more slots in here
[13316.76s -> 13319.24s]  Foods upstairs. Oh, yeah, you just bought one good
[13319.96s -> 13330.22s]  Yeah, that's it. We gotta get rid of them. Just make a crappy one, but i'll make one this no nobody
[13330.22s -> 13333.18s]  It's ice cream. It's the ice cream. It's the problem. It's the ice cream. It's gone
[13334.46s -> 13336.46s]  Sell for a hundred bucks
[13336.78s -> 13339.74s]  How much did I put this down for this thing is sucks?
[13344.78s -> 13347.58s]  Yeah, but it's not about the profit it's about no one is buying them
[13348.81s -> 13350.81s]  This shit is incredibly reasonable
[13352.16s -> 13355.52s]  Even if I did like four dollars, I mean no one's purchasing these
[13357.74s -> 13360.70s]  And when I put the low quality everyone started throwing up everywhere
[13372.12s -> 13377.72s]  I just watched five people. Yeah, five people just bought for the burger. Do you see do you see the numbers? This is the book
[13383.36s -> 13385.36s]  Look, let's just do food only
[13387.00s -> 13391.20s]  Look the food kiosks, they don't they don't do shit
[13391.76s -> 13393.76s]  They make 20 bucks a day
[13394.86s -> 13398.14s]  We're checking the numbers right now as opposed to for instance
[13398.70s -> 13402.54s]  Like the movie theater the porn theater makes three to six hundred plus dollars a day
[13404.33s -> 13406.73s]  The back of that table loses a thousand dollars
[13407.69s -> 13410.41s]  Uh, well, there's one day somebody probably cheated and I didn't kick them off the table
[13410.89s -> 13413.37s]  Uh slot machine didn't do very well. Yes, but it's fine. Whatever
[13417.72s -> 13419.80s]  No food porn
[13419.80s -> 13421.80s]  It brings people in that's how business works
[13422.12s -> 13426.60s]  I don't try to don't try to lecture me on fucking business. Okay, I try to like to be on business
[13429.32s -> 13434.60s]  I'm the guy that decided to make the expensive drinks only three dollars more than my profit margin. That's business
[13434.60s -> 13436.60s]  The convention is now finished
[13437.80s -> 13464.43s]  Ah, she's gone
[13464.43s -> 13474.80s]  I won

[13478.30s -> 13480.30s]  They're actually getting the they're actually
[13480.30s -> 13482.30s]  Ordering drinks. I should probably get another bartender
[13484.28s -> 13487.56s]  Another bar another bartender. I'm making money slowly
[13488.44s -> 13494.12s]  What about another ring? Uh another row slot machines slots slots right here. That's what i'm doing
[13494.92s -> 13496.92s]  The low ones the small ones the low bet ones
[13501.95s -> 13505.23s]  Why does this casino look like a tf2 trade server map?
[13512.52s -> 13514.52s]  I don't I don't know why
[13515.42s -> 13517.42s]  Oh wait, that's the wrong way
[13543.18s -> 13549.29s]  People love these things. God damn it. They just they they okay. I'm filling the fucking casino with these

[13609.72s -> 13611.24s]  maximum 75
[13611.24s -> 13623.44s]  A dealer doesn't play poker
[13623.44s -> 13625.04s]  Right, whatever
[13625.04s -> 13627.04s]  It's just the man. It's a video game

[20566.22s -> 20569.04s]  Okay, a group therapy stream
[20569.04s -> 20572.16s]  Would just be the family dinner stream again
[20576.91s -> 20580.19s]  You know, that's what it would be. The only difference would be it would just it would be
[20581.07s -> 20583.36s]  Somebody would be there
[20583.36s -> 20586.85s]  Sitting there pretending to be a therapist
[20588.77s -> 20590.45s]  I'm for part two

[20651.84s -> 20656.53s]  Thanks again. Hey snooze. Thanks for the 1500 bits. Hey jerma
[20656.53s -> 20659.89s]  Thanks for the great content you make and hope you and your loved ones are well during this time
[20660.45s -> 20662.37s]  Not to get into anything personal
[20662.37s -> 20666.69s]  But I was wanting to ask your opinion on how couples who don't have much in common make things work
[20667.74s -> 20671.12s]  You and kim seem like almost opposites in terms of personality
[20671.76s -> 20674.48s]  I might be wrong, but it just comes off that way. I wanted to see your thoughts on it
[20674.48s -> 20679.59s]  Thanks again for all that you do opposites attract
[20681.00s -> 20692.15s]  Isn't there isn't there like a whole thing about that? They hate each other
[20693.11s -> 20699.28s]  You guys have magnets
[20699.28s -> 20700.32s]  um
[20700.32s -> 20702.32s]  How do you hold on? Let me let me think about this
[20703.73s -> 20705.01s]  How do you
[20705.01s -> 20707.01s]  Couples don't have much in common
[20707.09s -> 20709.33s]  Well things that me and kim have in common you guys don't see
[20710.66s -> 20712.52s]  That you don't hear about
[20712.52s -> 20718.36s]  Like kim doesn't really play very many video games or doesn't really she's not really into this whole space here
[20719.00s -> 20722.84s]  She's not really into twitch or youtube or like gaming really but that's
[20723.56s -> 20725.96s]  We have a lot of other stuff in common that you guys don't even see
[20732.24s -> 20734.32s]  but
[20734.32s -> 20736.32s]  in terms of how
[20736.72s -> 20738.40s]  How would you have?
[20738.40s -> 20740.90s]  How would you make it work if you didn't have anything in common?
[20742.93s -> 20747.09s]  I don't know. I really do. I really can't answer that question. Unfortunately. I can't really give you a good answer
[20747.73s -> 20756.36s]  Because i'm trying to think of of if i've ever been in a scenario that was like that
[20758.29s -> 20762.85s]  But all the relationships that i've had there's been there's been at least a few things that were really
[20763.49s -> 20767.83s]  That we really clicked on
[20767.83s -> 20773.16s]  So I really can't give you too much advice on this or I can't give you my thoughts on it because I don't really
[20773.56s -> 20775.56s]  I don't really have an experience with it
[20777.60s -> 20779.44s]  Like what what do you have in common?
[20779.44s -> 20781.11s]  We both knit
[20781.11s -> 20789.89s]  We both sew
[20789.89s -> 20796.05s]  We both like we both love wine. We both like wine. We were very very passionate about wine
[20796.93s -> 20798.53s]  We both love food
[20798.53s -> 20800.53s]  We both love animals
[20801.25s -> 20806.13s]  A majority of our conversations are about animals are about dogs specifically auto
[20807.25s -> 20810.34s]  um
[20810.34s -> 20813.22s]  We both live in north las vegas, you know, right?
[20814.56s -> 20817.52s]  or henderson or summerlin or
[20819.09s -> 20829.01s]  Enterprise or i don't live on the strip. Yeah, nobody can live on the strip. It doesn't work that way
[20829.57s -> 20841.89s]  Nobody nobody like lives in like the belagio guys. That's not how it works. So that pretty much confirms the strip
[20849.41s -> 20850.87s]  Stop
[20850.87s -> 20859.17s]  Stop that now we got him. Nobody got me. Nobody got me
[20860.93s -> 20869.89s]  Uh, no, but we have we have plenty things in common. I don't know anything about knitting at all. I made that up
[20870.45s -> 20873.12s]  To make us seem cute
[20873.12s -> 20876.28s]  Shit, how do you have so much energy?
[20877.52s -> 20884.07s]  uh, it bottles up to a point where I can't contain it anymore and it has to come out either with a loud expletive noise
[20884.79s -> 20886.47s]  or
[20886.47s -> 20899.38s]  This has to come out has to but thank you snooze for the 15 dollars. Appreciate it. Miami hotlines again 250
[20899.38s -> 20903.06s]  Wow king you're so bad at this game. That's really epic and sexy of you. That's funny
[20903.46s -> 20906.74s]  That actually is kind of a funny comment the end of it. It's funny, too
[20907.38s -> 20911.06s]  Uh, thanks for the 250. Thanks the fax machine for the five community subs
[20912.39s -> 20914.95s]  Appreciate that
[20914.95s -> 20920.79s]  50 from goiki goiki. Thanks for the 5000 bits clown convention waiting room. I know and we didn't get to see it
[20920.87s -> 20923.14s]  We didn't get to even see it
[20923.14s -> 20927.68s]  Thanks for the 5000 bits
[20927.68s -> 20933.89s]  50 fucking dollars, dude
[20933.97s -> 20937.97s]  It was a little while ago, but sorry. I missed it. It's a lot of money
[20941.17s -> 20945.81s]  Hey geo love. Thanks with three dollars germa. Go see the clowns. I didn't I know I
[20946.61s -> 20949.01s]  Shit went off the rails there at the end
[20949.81s -> 20951.81s]  We'll come back to it tomorrow. We'll figure it out
[20952.84s -> 20954.76s]  Fix related cabbage. Thanks for 250 germa
[20954.76s -> 20959.00s]  I saw that you played super mario rpg last year and I was wondering if you would ever play paper mario
[20959.56s -> 20963.02s]  Maybe around august for the first game's 20th anniversary
[20964.12s -> 20973.94s]  Um, I mean august is long enough away where I could lie to you and say yes and then forget
[20974.66s -> 20977.67s]  But i'm not gonna do that I feel like I do that quite often
[20978.31s -> 20983.40s]  um
[20983.40s -> 20987.00s]  I'm gonna say maybe maybe for the 20th anniversary. Maybe
[20987.72s -> 20990.34s]  I know people love that game
[20990.34s -> 20993.48s]  Worth a shot. Hey skinny peter
[20993.96s -> 20996.92s]  Thanks for the thousand bits germa if we're going to get an easy bake oven stream
[20996.92s -> 20999.32s]  Could we also get a creepy crawly bug maker stream?
[21002.21s -> 21006.04s]  Part of the plan not only is it going to be an easy bake oven stream
[21006.04s -> 21009.32s]  But i'm also getting a bunch of other of those toy food item game things
[21010.56s -> 21011.68s]  And that's going to be one of them
[21011.68s -> 21016.00s]  Although I might refuse to eat them because they creepy crawler bug maker shit
[21016.72s -> 21018.72s]  Released in like 1998
[21019.12s -> 21022.40s]  And this stuff probably is not edible anymore. We'll find out if there's any new ones
[21024.42s -> 21026.84s]  Thanks for the thousand bits though
[21026.84s -> 21031.96s]  Our alecran thanks for the 250 germa. It's so nice to have found a conservative trump supporting streamer. I know I knew
[21032.52s -> 21035.08s]  As soon as you refuse to support bernie by rating him
[21050.50s -> 21052.50s]  political bernie pog
[21053.14s -> 21058.52s]  God you guys
[21058.52s -> 21060.52s]  You guys are on point tonight
[21062.00s -> 21064.29s]  Find his address
[21064.29s -> 21065.17s]  and
[21065.17s -> 21067.17s]  What political party does he follow?
[21067.49s -> 21069.49s]  Because you guys are fucking on fire tonight
[21078.48s -> 21080.72s]  He's actually northeast vegas
[21081.26s -> 21083.60s]  Northeast vegas left leaning
[21095.54s -> 21097.54s]  You guys are fucking nuts
[21100.08s -> 21102.26s]  Northeast vegas left. All right
[21104.71s -> 21111.75s]  We've had so many conversations on this stream about random shit. You could probably fucking piece together
[21112.39s -> 21115.27s]  The type of kind of political leanings that I have
[21115.83s -> 21120.47s]  Do it's not you know what I mean? Like do I really do you really what do you think?
[21127.41s -> 21129.97s]  He's a fucking liberal. He's a liberal
[21131.38s -> 21135.38s]  He must be he's got to be he's got to be and that's big that fires me up
[21135.86s -> 21142.56s]  No, he's probably he's one of those fucking right winners
[21143.81s -> 21146.37s]  God, I hate those mother fuckers
[21147.01s -> 21150.85s]  You understand how like he there's no winning here
[21156.34s -> 21161.70s]  What if what if I say one of these out loud half of you hate me for the rest of my life
[21162.42s -> 21164.42s]  You understand how this works?
[21166.10s -> 21172.18s]  Even if I do fall politically in one of these categories saying it out loud is a like
[21172.66s -> 21183.83s]  A third of you no longer want to hear me talk anymore. We don't already god damn it
[21187.99s -> 21189.27s]  At the east
[21189.27s -> 21191.27s]  Left leaning god damn it
[21192.02s -> 21196.58s]  All right. All right enough enough enough enough. We're moving on we're moving on from this
[21197.22s -> 21202.18s]  I don't like that. I don't like this joke. We're moving on from it. It's too. All right, we're too much. Let's go
[21206.44s -> 21210.12s]  No more no more of this. No more of this. No more. There's no more. No more. No more. No more. No more
[21212.58s -> 21218.92s]  here, okay, I live in a giant shoe in the middle of space and
[21219.80s -> 21225.08s]  I'm not even from your fucking planet. So how am I supposed to know where I've leaned politically on your planet?
[21225.08s -> 21230.20s]  I don't even know who what this is. I don't even know what the democrat republican left serve. I don't know if that is
[21231.36s -> 21233.36s]  I've got my own system up here
[21240.98s -> 21247.00s]  There you go. This is your answer for all your questions. Thanks. Goobery juice with the five dollars
[21248.07s -> 21254.55s]  Hey, oh, no ludo. Nine eight five. These are some memes and chat that you missed. Why don't we have like a me a chat meme?
[21256.30s -> 21261.64s]  Recap I thought I should start donating these so that the creators of these memes can get your reaction
[21263.62s -> 21265.54s]  Also last stream you implied
[21265.54s -> 21271.65s]  That something was going to happen to bugleberry in the future. No
[21272.37s -> 21274.45s]  Like no, that's not what i'm talking about
[21279.16s -> 21281.16s]  Bugleberry's gonna be fine. Don't worry
[21284.56s -> 21285.44s]  uh
[21285.44s -> 21291.40s]  But for the for the meme reactions, here's what's gonna happen. This is what's gonna happen here
[21293.28s -> 21296.32s]  I don't know how this is gonna be done, but this is how it's gonna be done
[21296.96s -> 21300.40s]  There's a lot of images that come on this stream tons of people give
[21301.12s -> 21304.80s]  Images there's links and links and hey, I want to see this. I want to see that. Hey check this out
[21304.88s -> 21306.64s]  Look at this. There's a photoshop
[21306.64s -> 21308.64s]  What's gonna happen is i'm gonna have
[21309.12s -> 21312.08s]  a window browser source that is capturing
[21312.72s -> 21314.96s]  a website that website will be
[21316.48s -> 21321.09s]  I'm not going to tell you what website this is
[21322.31s -> 21325.11s]  Because I don't fuck who cares. It's reddit. There's going to be a reddit
[21325.51s -> 21327.51s]  That's specifically going to be for image uploads
[21331.33s -> 21336.13s]  And I can capture it and over the course of the stream. I can just cap it and we can go through like three or four of them
[21336.69s -> 21340.44s]  They'll just be right there
[21340.44s -> 21345.64s]  And if there's images that come through the stream like they always is like at least five six seven of them come out of each stream
[21346.12s -> 21348.12s]  It'll already be captured and we can already just do it
[21350.71s -> 21352.71s]  And they can be you know
[21353.57s -> 21357.73s]  If we have a good enough non shit posting kind of yeah guy
[21357.97s -> 21372.21s]  I'm just gonna spam the reddit. We'll have people check them before I click so there'll be ways for me to check
[21372.77s -> 21374.90s]  That'll work out
[21374.90s -> 21382.80s]  So then it keeps image links out of the chat room so people can chat
[21383.44s -> 21386.00s]  Or yell their favorite video game at me once a day
[21386.72s -> 21391.54s]  And we can have that in a separate place that it's easy for me to get to
[21398.71s -> 21400.71s]  Crash bandicoot 2 that's your favorite game
[21401.35s -> 21403.43s]  Well, we should probably talk about that
[21404.15s -> 21410.85s]  But that's where they're gonna be and I and by the way, i'm making the reddit
[21411.49s -> 21416.85s]  So it's like well, okay. I I have two already. No, no, no, no. No, it's i'm gonna own this shit
[21419.03s -> 21422.79s]  And you will not know what it is until it is ready and it's only gonna come from my mouth
[21426.45s -> 21434.07s]  That's where it's gonna go. How'd you call me out like that?
[21434.63s -> 21440.40s]  I've won. I said we have to talk about that. Why not crash bandicoot 3?
[21441.28s -> 21443.28s]  Racing team racing. Why two?
[21443.76s -> 21448.88s]  I thought three was a better one three had more characters three had more tracks and it was graphically superior
[21449.60s -> 21462.05s]  I'm just I that's just my opinion. That's what I think
[21462.93s -> 21464.93s]  Is there a crash team racing three?
[21465.40s -> 21470.40s]  Is there one?
[21470.40s -> 21477.92s]  No, okay. Never mind. Uh in the meantime
[21479.36s -> 21480.64s]  we're
[21480.64s -> 21482.32s]  we're gonna have to
[21482.32s -> 21484.34s]  abstain from
[21484.34s -> 21489.38s]  Clicking on images and till I get that shit going i'm gonna try to get that going over the next few days
[21490.10s -> 21495.24s]  Probably like next week or in like probably two months because that's like a real time frame from my fucking
[21496.44s -> 21500.60s]  High koala brain
[21500.60s -> 21502.20s]  Uh, let's see. What do you got?
[21502.20s -> 21510.44s]  What do you got? What do you got?
[21517.57s -> 21519.57s]  And there's a bunch of videos on here
[21526.79s -> 21532.47s]  I'd save them save them save them. There's there's like eight. There's like three videos and eight like seven images on here
[21534.12s -> 21536.12s]  Those three images in four videos
[21541.00s -> 21546.76s]  And I save them for community content night. Oh, but we never see those because he never fucking does those either
[21552.12s -> 21556.68s]  Yeah, I know. I know. I know give it to me. Let me hear it. Let me hear it. I know let me hear it
[21559.46s -> 21561.46s]  At least click the last image
[21567.49s -> 21570.29s]  Hold on. Let me load some of these up. Oh my fucking god
[21575.04s -> 21577.04s]  I this is not even my
[21580.60s -> 21586.55s]  Okay, i'll show off the images and let's hold on a second. Oh, this is fucking terrifying
[21587.91s -> 21590.47s]  Why do all these have to be besides the bernie pogg one?
[21591.03s -> 21613.09s]  Let's take a look at this one pretty good. All right, that one's good
[21614.95s -> 21617.27s]  This is an ed ed and eddy picture of ed
[21619.16s -> 21621.16s]  I believe that is him eating a shoe
[21624.04s -> 21630.84s]  It is okay
[21630.84s -> 21632.84s]  and then here is
[21632.92s -> 21636.87s]  bernie pogg
[21636.87s -> 21642.76s]  Where is it?
[21642.84s -> 21665.00s]  Okay. Well, I didn't mean to stretch that what is this one? I can't make that an emo. That's not my face
[21679.28s -> 21682.87s]  Watch that if you want
[21690.00s -> 21703.92s]  Here look it's like a ton of noise and a bunch of kids like
[21706.16s -> 21708.96s]  Oh look at that you just walk in and you just go like
[21717.78s -> 21719.78s]  All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow
[21720.45s -> 21721.81s]  That's the end
[21721.81s -> 21723.81s]  That's where it ends
[21723.81s -> 21727.01s]  except
[21727.01s -> 21730.61s]  Uh squimps gave ten dollars and fifty cents ten fifty

[21735.59s -> 21739.84s]  I'm a college student who got kicked out of the dorms by the whole covet situation
[21740.48s -> 21742.48s]  Those streams have really helped me get through everything
[21742.64s -> 21745.68s]  I've been in quarantine with my dad and we watch your streams together pretty much every day
[21746.50s -> 21748.50s]  Anyways, it's his birthday tomorrow
[21748.50s -> 21750.50s]  You can wish him a happy birthday. That would be pretty cool
[21751.33s -> 21753.33s]  All right, you don't have to of course I will
[21754.44s -> 21757.46s]  Hey lewis, happy birthday lewis
[21758.10s -> 21762.29s]  Take care of each other. Hope you have a great one
[21763.01s -> 21767.08s]  Not sure how old you are, but
[21767.08s -> 21769.97s]  Hey

[21777.08s -> 21788.96s]  38 with a college. I'm not that that's that's like a
[21789.52s -> 21793.52s]  Like a hey you look 38 and if you're like 40 or 55 or something like that
[21793.60s -> 21797.44s]  Oh, if you're like in your 40s or 50s like oh what i'm 30. I look 38. That's good
[21797.84s -> 21802.96s]  That's like a good thing like hey 38 never looks so good, right? You look like you're 38. You could be like 50
[21803.65s -> 21808.07s]  That's good. That's why I said that
[21808.55s -> 21810.23s]  That's a boomer joke
[21810.23s -> 21814.15s]  Yeah, okay sweat out. What are you? I'm not no i'm not mocking anybody
[21814.87s -> 21817.92s]  So it doesn't look 38. No, i'm saying like
[21818.56s -> 21823.44s]  Let's say for instance, let's just say for instance that somebody's like 50 years old or 45 years old
[21823.68s -> 21835.30s]  Hey, dude, like hey 38 never looks so good, right? Like, oh 38. Yeah. Okay, you're fun. Stop we get it

[21842.52s -> 21844.80s]  And that's very clear
[21844.80s -> 21846.80s]  By the way that you are acting
[21847.20s -> 21859.08s]  See you tomorrow wait
[21859.08s -> 21860.04s]  I

[21862.12s -> 21863.24s]  bits
[21863.24s -> 21865.24s]  from dumpus rumpus
[21865.40s -> 21869.80s]  Dumpus rumpus. Thanks for five dollars. Jeremy long time viewer first time donator. Thanks dumpus
[21870.52s -> 21873.24s]  Thanks for being my favorite entertainer for the last like eight fucking years
[21874.04s -> 21877.11s]  I can't believe you still think i'm interesting eight years later
[21878.31s -> 21880.63s]  We've talked about this before
[21882.23s -> 21883.67s]  But
[21883.67s -> 21885.67s]  um watching tv shows
[21886.31s -> 21892.61s]  After season seven or eight usually people just don't fucking care anymore. That's shocking to me
[21892.61s -> 21894.85s]  I'm like, I can't believe people still like this
[21895.65s -> 21897.89s]  Well, thanks
[21898.05s -> 21906.32s]  Appreciate it. No, we're not raiding it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[21907.28s -> 21910.72s]  No
[21910.72s -> 21912.80s]  I gotta get them under control. I've got to get them under control
[21914.50s -> 21916.82s]  That's gonna it's gonna take a double to get them under control
[21917.46s -> 21920.50s]  We're gonna have to take double. I think yep it is
[21925.06s -> 21925.94s]  Stop
[21925.94s -> 21934.61s]  Okay, good
[21934.61s -> 21939.17s]  Hey, juby. Thanks for the five dollars. This has been a god tier stream. You ever played evil genius
[21939.81s -> 21943.97s]  If you like this game, I think that'd make a great stream too. It's actually on the list. It is on the list
[21944.69s -> 21949.84s]  Get rid of me, please
[21949.84s -> 21951.84s]  You're gonna say my name spell it correctly
[21961.17s -> 21963.33s]  Be a lot. I see it misspelled quite frequently actually
[21967.20s -> 21969.20s]  All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night guys
[21970.02s -> 21976.87s]  Take care. Have a great rest of your night. Yep. We're gonna play more casino ink tomorrow afternoon and then from there
[21977.67s -> 21981.83s]  From there we will go
[21981.83s -> 21983.83s]  to potentially watch a movie
