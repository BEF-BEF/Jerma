[5.05s -> 11.05s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Fistful of Frags on a gameplay commentary.
[11.61s -> 16.07s]  I screwed that one up. It's actually a gameplay commentary on Fistful of Frags.
[16.63s -> 21.19s]  I screw I went backwards on it. I haven't had my coffee this morning. So forgive me. But hi, how are you guys?
[21.27s -> 27.59s]  Welcome to this video. It's been a little while since I made a just talking to the microphone video like you're watching right now.
[27.99s -> 31.83s]  Where I just discuss something that's on my mind or something that's sort of relevant to
[32.39s -> 37.67s]  The gaming world or even just my life in general. This is just gonna be kind of an update one of those update-y
[38.15s -> 43.75s]  I ramble and rant for like five to ten minutes and that's it. So Fistful of Frags in the background
[44.07s -> 46.07s]  This is my game of the year for 2014
[46.23s -> 49.43s]  If you were curious at what my game of the years are for 2014
[49.67s -> 52.79s]  We're gonna get those out of the way because I haven't really talked about it
[52.79s -> 57.03s]  I talked about it like once in star stream a week or so ago, but here you go
[57.03s -> 61.10s]  Here are my games of the year for 2014 in no particular order
[61.18s -> 68.82s]  Okay, Fistful of Frags, Finding of Isaac Rebirth, Shadow of Mordor, Smite, and Lethal League.
[69.32s -> 74.44s]  So there you go. Those are my top five games that came out in 2014 and technically Fistful of Frags
[75.35s -> 81.67s]  Was a mod from a long time ago, but it released on steam in 2014
[82.07s -> 84.39s]  So if you don't want to count Fistful of Frags
[84.87s -> 91.51s]  Then it's Tactical Intervention again because Tactical Intervention is game of the year every fucking year no matter what year it is
[91.51s -> 96.07s]  Okay, so just you can replace that wherever you want and now that that's out of the way
[96.31s -> 98.31s]  We're gonna actually talk about
[98.31s -> 101.19s]  One of them in particular the one that you're watching right now Fistful of Frags
[101.75s -> 110.22s]  and how I really wish there were more games like this because I'm just I I need fresh ideas
[110.87s -> 114.15s]  And I'm not saying that as like oh, I'm so smart. I'm so intelligent
[114.31s -> 120.07s]  I need something that can fill my brain with all kinds of wonderful knowledge. No, no, it's I need something. That's just interesting
[120.47s -> 126.81s]  If something doesn't interest me, I can't do it. I can't play it the same thing with this youtube channel guys
[127.37s -> 132.23s]  If something doesn't interest me enough to make a video, I'm not gonna make a video
[132.63s -> 138.95s]  I'm not gonna press a button to record and force myself to upload a video because I have to be interested in something
[138.95s -> 139.99s]  It has to be something that I go
[139.99s -> 145.30s]  You know what? Okay that I want to do that and if you take a look at some of the recent first-person shooters
[145.96s -> 150.52s]  That you know when I say recent I mean the last 10 years or five years. That's not recent at all
[151.91s -> 157.91s]  Sorry, if you take a look at the most recent first-person shooters in the last fucking decade, that's a stupid thing to say
[158.39s -> 163.77s]  But in my recent memory of gaming I gravitate towards games that have interesting ideas
[164.47s -> 169.59s]  Strange stuff crazy weird mechanics style. I don't like to play
[170.44s -> 177.40s]  The kind of run-of-the-mill shooters i'm not saying they're bad games. I just have trouble. I have such attention deficit hyperactivity disorder guys
[177.40s -> 184.25s]  I have adhd if I don't immediately like get hold on a second. There's a squirrel at my window
[196.12s -> 200.44s]  If I don't get locked into something within the first hour or so of playing the game
[200.84s -> 204.36s]  I'm not really going to put that much time into it. It has to be pretty colors
[204.52s -> 209.58s]  It has to be interesting gameplay. It's got to be something to make my brain click and that doesn't happen that frequently
[210.28s -> 213.48s]  And that's my transition to talking about overwatch
[214.39s -> 217.51s]  Overwatch is the new blizzard game that's coming out in the next
[218.23s -> 222.07s]  Maybe within the next year or so there'll be a beta. I think eventually coming up here soon
[222.07s -> 224.02s]  I don't know
[224.02s -> 228.18s]  I don't want to get so hyped up about overwatch for one very specific reason
[229.51s -> 233.93s]  It might not be that fun. I'm not going to say it isn't going to be fun
[234.33s -> 236.33s]  I'm just saying that there's a possibility
[236.73s -> 241.53s]  With the track record of the last five years or so from all these triple a companies releasing games
[241.77s -> 243.77s]  And a lot of them being not that great
[244.82s -> 247.14s]  I don't I just don't want to get hyped up about a game anymore
[247.96s -> 253.72s]  Now this is not a shot at blizzard because this game might be fantastic overwatch might be a fantastic game
[254.04s -> 257.96s]  Which I will dump a ton of time into but I just don't know that yet
[258.12s -> 262.36s]  And I really wish the overwatch team the absolute best of luck
[262.76s -> 265.24s]  And I hope you guys come up with something great
[265.48s -> 269.56s]  I hope it's interesting and I hope it's really fun because I really want to enjoy it
[270.30s -> 274.70s]  and hopefully the name of the game is still overwatch by the time you're watching this video because
[275.10s -> 277.10s]  They just got like a trademark problem
[277.18s -> 279.82s]  So the game the name of the game could be like fusion core
[280.06s -> 280.38s]  All right
[280.38s -> 284.63s]  So when fusion core comes out in whatever beta it's going to come out in
[285.53s -> 287.85s]  I'll take a look at it and we'll talk again there
[288.09s -> 294.44s]  But I need to be very very careful and I can't stress this enough at how careful I need to be
[294.84s -> 299.40s]  When overwatch comes into beta because beta means it's a beta
[299.88s -> 303.48s]  And the same exact scenario I do not want to have play out
[303.80s -> 311.18s]  What happened to me when I played smite one of my other 2014 games of the year when smite was in very very early closed beta
[311.72s -> 316.92s]  I played a shitload of it. I was so into it. I was making videos on it
[316.92s -> 318.68s]  It was I go this game is so much fun
[318.68s -> 320.44s]  This is such an awesome game
[320.44s -> 324.68s]  But it was so early in the game's development and it wasn't even close to being ready yet
[324.92s -> 326.76s]  There was a lot of unbalanced gods
[326.76s -> 332.60s]  There was a lot of broken stuff in the game and it was frustrating and I really burnt myself out
[332.76s -> 338.28s]  In that year or so that I put into that closed beta because it was such a fun idea
[338.28s -> 341.98s]  It was such a great fun concept and it wasn't done
[342.22s -> 346.54s]  It just wasn't done and I put all my energy into it when it wasn't done
[347.18s -> 350.94s]  So I don't want to do the same thing with overwatch. I'm looking into a crystal ball right now
[351.34s -> 355.90s]  And i'm seeing the same scenario play out. It's a game that looks really fun
[356.38s -> 357.90s]  Really interesting
[357.90s -> 360.78s]  And i'm gonna put time into it when it's not done
[361.18s -> 364.22s]  So I again want to stress to myself and to you guys out there
[364.71s -> 367.91s]  When you're playing a new game that you're hyped up for and this is like hype in general
[368.81s -> 370.73s]  Just let it play out a little bit
[370.81s -> 375.93s]  Don't just dump all your eggs in one basket and like and spend a huge amount of time in something
[376.49s -> 380.18s]  Knowing that when you're done putting all the time into it
[380.58s -> 386.26s]  You might not care anymore when it's actually a finished product and potentially a way better product
[386.58s -> 388.82s]  Than the one that you put all the time in two years ago
[389.22s -> 392.26s]  So that's gonna wrap up this video guys. That's all I really wanted to say
[392.66s -> 397.94s]  Um the wrap one more thing my book i'm still working on the book books are hard. Uh, don't expect it's gonna suck
[398.42s -> 400.41s]  um and
[400.41s -> 404.57s]  Eat your vegetables because there's all kinds of calcium and there's all kinds
[404.65s -> 407.61s]  You know, there's vitamin k in that broccoli there. There's vitamin k in that broccoli
[407.61s -> 408.57s]  You want to eat that broccoli?
[408.57s -> 414.17s]  Make sure you're taking a little bit of protein too because protein is the building block of all cells and that's it
[414.41s -> 416.78s]  That's the end of the video
