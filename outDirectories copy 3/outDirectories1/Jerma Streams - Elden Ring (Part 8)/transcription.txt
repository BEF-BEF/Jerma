[3.06s -> 18.39s]  I am back. How are you? I missed it by one minute. One minute. I'm here. Make an Elden Ring open
[18.39s -> 34.58s]  and ready. All right, that was nice. I had some food, had a little bit more water, played with
[34.58s -> 44.76s]  Otto, hung out with Holly for a little bit. Let me just stir my drink because I can't close it
[44.76s -> 54.33s]  because I have too much ice in it. Just say what you did. I didn't do the thing you're describing,
[55.98s -> 67.70s]  but you know, I do need to plug this in. I don't know what happened to my GoXLR, but the audio jack
[67.70s -> 75.48s]  where you plug in a pair of headphones is broken. I didn't really do anything. I don't get it.
[81.43s -> 92.62s]  Okay, Elden Ring. Let's open it. You guys cannot see anything, can you? No, you cannot yet.
[93.26s -> 103.32s]  What's in my pocket? All right, so I gotta remember what the hell I was doing because it's been a
[103.32s -> 111.77s]  few days. I think I want to go north east. I believe that's where I'm heading.
[121.21s -> 133.74s]  Oh, I gotta change the category because we're in Elden Ring now, not Big Brain Academy. All right,
[133.74s -> 144.04s]  put a heart rate monitor on. I don't have access to a heart rate monitor at the moment. I'm sorry.
[144.76s -> 171.78s]  Dude, you should put a heart rate monitor on. Maybe another time? Very cool. I need to change
[171.78s -> 194.02s]  that. Oh, why is it getting louder? I am fresh. I've returned. I know the audio is not in sync.
[194.02s -> 227.43s]  Give me one second while I fix it. It'll be good. There we go. There. Hi. Let's go. Elden Ring.
[232.38s -> 238.76s]  This motherfucker looks like he drinks aloe vera juice. Well, I can assure you I don't.
[238.76s -> 260.71s]  I don't drink aloe vera juice. Why? Whatever. Okay, so I came over here because it was a few
[260.71s -> 268.14s]  things I didn't do this way. If you're wondering the character, yeah, baby rattle. I'll give you
[268.14s -> 271.90s]  just some people that are jumping in that are like, well, what's your gear, bro? What's your
[271.90s -> 280.34s]  loadout, bro? Imp cat head, godskin noble robe, godskin apostle bracers, godskin trousers,
[282.76s -> 287.00s]  plus nine bastard stars and a plus four glint stone as your glint stone. Staff,
[287.72s -> 297.43s]  did you bring your notes? I did. I did bring my notes. They're not showing. I did bring them.
[298.07s -> 306.06s]  They're there. All right. Door next to spawn is blocked shut. Who cares? Looking for Lanya.
[306.06s -> 311.62s]  Haven't found them yet. That prawn guy says piss off. I don't know what to do with that person.
[313.62s -> 318.74s]  The- I did- I did the elevator, didn't I? The sea offer elevator. I think I did that already.
[321.05s -> 333.14s]  Didn't I put it in? I got this. I remember getting the complete coin. And I think I did that. I did.
[333.70s -> 346.34s]  So we don't have very much here as of right now, but let's go. Go kill the prawn guy.
[347.61s -> 360.07s]  Uh, I want to go over here. There's this urn tree that I have not done.
[360.71s -> 371.24s]  There's a bunch of random shit over here. Like that. Like this. Like that. So we're going to
[371.24s -> 378.09s]  make our way this way. Why do we still look like this? Oh, we still look like this because
[378.09s -> 391.50s]  something's wrong with my audio. Get this for a second. Only coming through one ear.
[392.38s -> 403.82s]  That's better. Okay. I can hear. All right, let's go to five first. Yeah, we're still doing like
[403.82s -> 424.52s]  the cat baby thing. So this is area I've not been in. I think this is a church, right? Okay,
[424.52s -> 448.09s]  this trebuchet's launching. Please. Thank you. That was a bird. Okay. I saw a shadow of a bird
[448.09s -> 461.19s]  and I freaked out. I don't think they can launch over here. Shit mean anything? Why do you have
[461.19s -> 469.14s]  a toddler on a horse? Just go see the last vaude. I, it's hard to explain.
[469.94s -> 485.58s]  Hey, I learned this from Reddit. Are you behind me? Holy shit. You're behind me.
[486.14s -> 507.78s]  That didn't hit him. Oh boy. This is bad. Christ. Oh my God. What's happening? What have I done?
[524.34s -> 551.37s]  No, don't block that shit. Where is it? I'm trying to get it to kill him. Sucker. Sucker.
[579.26s -> 581.58s]  That hits. I didn't know that hit that many times in a row.
[582.38s -> 608.42s]  I got to kill the guy behind that guy. What area is this? This area is. Hold on. I can't really
[608.42s -> 617.38s]  stop. Give me one sec. Damn. This weapon's actually really, really good. We talked a lot of shit.
[619.22s -> 628.81s]  Okay. This area is this sort of Northern Lurnia is this church right here.
[629.53s -> 633.48s]  Is this ever jail? I know, I know how to say it correct now.
[634.42s -> 637.06s]  I don't want to go this way though. I want to go to my marker over here.
[640.47s -> 646.57s]  Popium. So many fucking markers. All right. We'll get rid of this guy.
[653.46s -> 672.30s]  I'm actually destroying people in this zone. I'm annihilating people in this zone. I must be high
[672.30s -> 679.38s]  for this place. I must be very leveled for this area. At least this exact spot here.
[680.10s -> 694.15s]  Yeah, I definitely am. Did you avoid most spoilers? Great mace. Um, yes. The only thing that was ever
[694.15s -> 702.14s]  spoiled for me was the witch quest because I had it on a second monitor over here. And I've,
[702.14s -> 708.86s]  I apologized for that. I already apologized for it. So we're not doing, I got no more guides.
[709.42s -> 725.14s]  Okay. Up there. Can I even get up there? That seems far away. There might be a dungeon over
[725.14s -> 741.14s]  here too. Ooh, cookie bug. He definitely smoked on that 20 minute break. No, I can't. I can't.
[742.71s -> 747.03s]  I got way too much shit to do over the next like two or three straight days. I can't like,
[747.03s -> 780.28s]  I can't get like, no, that's not happening. Not right now. Dungeon? Why are they here? How have I
[780.28s -> 786.09s]  not come up to this kind of Northern Lurnia? Where have I been this whole time? Doing the
[786.09s -> 794.36s]  witch quest right? That took almost a whole stream. Yellow ember. Nothing over here though.
[801.08s -> 816.76s]  All right. There we go. I'm watching you. Hey, how are you? What's that sound? What's going on?
[816.76s -> 819.64s]  What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?
[819.64s -> 825.26s]  What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?
[825.26s -> 848.52s]  What was that? I need a bonfire. It's the, it's the bloodborne shit. That's bloodborne shit. That's
[849.16s -> 853.96s]  what they call, they would call like the winter lanterns and they'd walk around and if you saw
[853.96s -> 868.18s]  them it would fill and you went, you died. Okay. Is it just a line of sight thing? If it's a line of
[868.18s -> 879.94s]  sight thing, I may be all right. Is it line of sight? Okay. It's character line of sight. Jesus.
[880.50s -> 915.85s]  I can't see it. All right. Let me get up there and kill whoever's doing that. What the fuck?
[919.96s -> 946.95s]  Is that a machine? Oh, fuck you. All right. Cool. It's not going to affect me when I'm right here,
[946.95s -> 979.64s]  right? Five G. Howl of Shiburi. Spell? Shrieks building up madness in nearby foes. 33 faith.
[979.64s -> 984.50s]  At least it's a maddening shriek that causes madness build up in foes nearby.
[985.46s -> 1002.97s]  And it's a taunt. That's kind of cool. So what happens if I go up here? What's the, am I going
[1002.97s -> 1020.60s]  to get madnessed? Oh, your person is so ugly. No, don't say that. Why am I still getting it?
[1021.24s -> 1032.74s]  Alleviate's build up of frost. Alleviate's build up of sleep. Scarlet rot, blood loss, frost,
[1032.74s -> 1052.76s]  sleep. I don't have any madness ones. Do I? Light, sleep? No. All right. Here's the plan.
[1052.76s -> 1056.92s]  I'm going to go up there. If I die, I die. I'm going to start the process right now. Go.
[1057.64s -> 1079.24s]  What the fuck is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? Throw a grenade up there.
[1079.88s -> 1107.83s]  That it? That's it? All right. I did it. So that means I can walk around here without a problem.
[1107.83s -> 1112.17s]  It was just them doing that. Okay. Well, that's weird. No chest or anything.
[1117.13s -> 1124.84s]  But that means I can walk around here without hiding. All right. The actual place I want to
[1124.84s -> 1135.62s]  go is five. I got the chest. Yeah, that's right. You're right. I got it. That just lets you,
[1135.62s -> 1149.14s]  hopefully it doesn't respawn there. This is ruins here too. Remember you look like a Renaissance
[1149.14s -> 1168.12s]  painting. Now I do frenzied flame village. There's gonna be another one of those things
[1168.12s -> 1180.39s]  here in there. I have not found a bonfire, so I really have to be careful. Even though,
[1182.49s -> 1188.57s]  even though I might be a tad overleveled for this exact spot, died from less.
[1204.33s -> 1224.41s]  Pretty clean. Clean. What is it? Is this a mask? It's not. What was that?
[1224.97s -> 1242.73s]  Isn't it a spell? An item? It's talisman. Constantly attracts enemy aggression.
[1242.73s -> 1248.94s]  Okay. Somebody explain this to me, right? In the souls games, they have items like this.
[1250.97s -> 1257.14s]  What's the point of this item? Why would you put this on? Why would you ever want to wear this?
[1259.40s -> 1264.84s]  Make co-op easier. Co-op. It's tanking in a summon for hard mode farming items.
[1265.48s -> 1279.32s]  Co-op to tank. Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. You're right. What else is in here?
[1279.32s -> 1315.64s]  How do I hear something weird? Note the lord of frenzied flame. Boss? Okay. Beneath Lindell,
[1315.64s -> 1320.44s]  at the very bottom lies our lord. Lord of the frenzied. The three fingers who holds us in thrall.
[1321.00s -> 1332.86s]  Beneath Lindell. Where's Lindell? Lindell? Lindell? Three fingers. What happened to
[1332.86s -> 1345.05s]  two fingers? Have I been to Lindell? What are the notes? That's not. Yeah, that's true. What does it
[1345.05s -> 1370.87s]  say? Beneath Lindell. The very bottom. At the very bottom of Lindell. Frenzied flame lord. Okay.
[1370.87s -> 1388.41s]  Good to know. I don't think I've come across Lindell yet. Is there anything else here? I feel
[1388.41s -> 1395.16s]  like there would be, right? A lot of these places have little dungeons to go in, so I'm not fucking
[1395.16s -> 1414.74s]  missing it. Maybe not. Maybe it's just a village. I think it's just a village. I think it's a lore
[1414.74s -> 1435.05s]  village. Something keeps making, I keep hearing sounds. Like loud sounds. I don't know if it's
[1435.05s -> 1441.70s]  just the atmosphere or what. Well, I don't know. That's cool. Closer to my actual goal, which is
[1442.58s -> 1445.62s]  no, I'm going the wrong way. But I did want to go to the urtree. Let's go fight the avatar.
[1446.42s -> 1479.70s]  I need a bonfire now. Really? That's, that's too many. Challenge though. Let's do it.
[1483.66s -> 1486.94s]  Okay. Nevermind. I nevermind. I don't want to do it anymore. I was kidding.
[1487.66s -> 1529.14s]  Nevermind. Nevermind. Goodbye. Stop it. You might, I might get something for this. I don't know.
[1530.02s -> 1562.73s]  Let me do my stupid fucking move. All right. Is there any reason for me to do that? Grave violet.
[1562.73s -> 1571.82s]  Okay. That nothing, nobody dropped anything cool. Nobody had anything. Ooh. What's that way? Market.
[1572.38s -> 1585.00s]  What is that? All right. Pay attention. I need, I need a bonfire. It's gotta be one down here,
[1585.00s -> 1662.25s]  right? He's going to kill me. Oh, it's a giant. It's one of the fucking bear. Does he care? I
[1662.25s -> 1741.56s]  don't think he knows. Get off. Oh, got him. 3000 damage. Yeah. I may be a little, a little,
[1741.56s -> 1752.33s]  a little leveled up with this guy. It's very possible that I'm a little leveled up,
[1752.33s -> 1757.56s]  although I have not seen anything in this area. So, you know, I'm not going to just not do it,
[1757.56s -> 1770.65s]  right? It's definitely a dungeon down here without a doubt. Like a million percent dungeon,
[1770.89s -> 1814.23s]  100 million percent. Come on. Hey, how did you miss? You literally saw the entrance. I did.
[1814.95s -> 1838.68s]  I did. No, I didn't. Tomically large arrows. Where's the entrance? Oh, it was a liar. Okay.
[1838.68s -> 1847.58s]  Oh, it was a liar. Okay. Somebody that's lying. All right. There's somebody with a bone arrow
[1847.58s -> 1855.16s]  down there. Whatever. Where the fuck am I? All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1855.16s -> 1858.76s]  I'm biting off way more than I should. Back up to what I wanted to do. I'm getting too distracted.
[1858.76s -> 1864.97s]  This is literally the distract yourself video game. You'll see something far away. You'll go,
[1864.97s -> 1869.05s]  oh, I'm going to go to that thing. You'll trot like 15 feet in front of you and go,
[1869.05s -> 1873.29s]  what's that? And turn left and just you lost. And then you do something else for like four hours.
[1875.18s -> 1892.54s]  So focus on the task that is at hand right now. Go to the tree, which I need to get up.
[1892.54s -> 1910.15s]  Can I get up from here? Who's that? Who the fuck is this guy? Why do you look so special?
[1910.15s -> 1946.74s]  Doesn't he look special? He's, he's a little special. All right. He was a little special.
[1946.74s -> 1958.74s]  Oh shit. I found a spark. Cool. Elum highway, black knife catacombs. Somebody said this dungeon
[1958.74s -> 1981.16s]  sucks. Beast eye quivers. The beast eye quivers. Beast eye quivers. I have a beast. Is that to
[1981.16s -> 1991.21s]  tremble when close to death route? Oh, okay. That just means there's an undead. Okay. Cool.
[1992.90s -> 2001.18s]  Maybe I can. Yeah. I'm probably pretty level for this place. So I'm not scared.
[2001.18s -> 2013.74s]  This does not scare me. Yeah. That's the guy that eats the, uh, that eats them, right?
[2013.74s -> 2016.38s]  Although who knows? I could be just totaled full of shit right now.
[2016.94s -> 2042.12s]  I know I could just be full of shit and I lose immediately to this guy. Oh,
[2043.16s -> 2064.09s]  there's a stone sword key thingy. Um, why won't they die? What? I want to go in here.
[2064.09s -> 2076.47s]  Do they not die? These are like the bones people from Mario and I'm not killed. Okay. You can't
[2076.47s -> 2093.77s]  kill them. Those guys don't die dry bones. Yeah. That's the character I'm thinking of.
[2099.51s -> 2102.71s]  All right. Just, I, I gotta, I can't kill them. So just, I gotta get my souls. It's going to go
[2102.71s -> 2116.01s]  in the stone sword key room because that I want to get in there. All right. So what, what's in here?
[2117.74s -> 2128.01s]  Oh, what is that thing? Oh, this is acts. Is there anything else? I need you guys to fuck off for
[2128.01s -> 2146.90s]  one second. Nothing else in here. Okay. Oh, that guy's bringing them to life. Okay. So you just
[2146.90s -> 2156.15s]  have to kill that guy. Sounds easy enough. I want to see. Why is this guy coming back?
[2158.65s -> 2165.14s]  That guy was different. I want to see the acts. This is an int scaling acts.
[2167.69s -> 2172.57s]  Roses who shows the path to the catacombs or the lands between is depicted on the virtual acts
[2176.17s -> 2194.44s]  summon. Really? Whoa. That's a pretty bad ass move. That's pretty bad ass.
[2194.60s -> 2206.66s]  What is it? It scales with strength and int. Oh, only 18 strength. Don't think I want to change it
[2206.66s -> 2212.54s]  over the baby rattle at this point in the game. Maybe rattle too good. That's it. That's really
[2212.54s -> 2221.34s]  cool. All right. No more stalling. Let's go. I have to go through this bullshit. I thought I
[2221.34s -> 2227.34s]  got hit by it. I was like, how the fuck is that possible? I was about to start freaking out and
[2227.34s -> 2231.10s]  talking shit about from software. I was going to be like, there's no way it's impossible for that
[2231.10s -> 2255.70s]  to happen. Stop, stop it. All right. Now I'm fucking mad at this guy. Sorry. I forgot the buttons for
[2256.58s -> 2271.26s]  a second. It's been like a week yet. These guys are connected to a sorcerer.
[2271.82s -> 2294.38s]  Why fight them? There's no reason to. Okay. I can go down. Let's go down.
[2296.60s -> 2318.98s]  Now you get it. The crab is like dirt crabs. Are they hostile? I don't think they are.
[2319.62s -> 2343.94s]  I think that I'm just unnecessary. Kill it before I can do anything. Rune arc.
[2343.94s -> 2358.94s]  Ray. Really? The whole point was I didn't want you to come near me, but you did anyways.
[2359.58s -> 2403.05s]  So this is obviously not correct. Obviously. I didn't get up there. I can't kill these guys.
[2403.93s -> 2425.88s]  Stop for one second. I can't even fucking look. Wait, do you? I don't think I'm supposed to do
[2425.88s -> 2441.77s]  that. Is that how you do it? That is how you do it. What a gigabrain. I didn't look at any,
[2441.77s -> 2446.47s]  nobody in chat said that. I go back and look at the logs and literally nobody when I looked over,
[2446.47s -> 2450.55s]  like the precise moment I looked over, nobody said ride them up. Nobody did.
[2451.43s -> 2454.55s]  Oh, like, I mean, that's, you know, well accomplished.
[2456.92s -> 2469.96s]  Yeah. All right. There's another. Thank God.
[2472.01s -> 2487.88s]  Scimitar. He did it all by himself. No guide. Don't you guys understand? The only way you can
[2487.88s -> 2493.32s]  play a From Software game truly by yourself is if you play within the first like two days
[2493.32s -> 2509.74s]  the game comes up. That means offline. Okay. Offline. So no blood stains, no messages,
[2509.74s -> 2516.17s]  right? The person that gets there first, that puts the message down. Yeah, they did it by themselves.
[2523.48s -> 2530.84s]  I didn't do that by myself. See, I looked over and somebody said invis wall. So I just deduced
[2531.48s -> 2535.08s]  where the best possible scenario with the best possible place that would be.
[2536.86s -> 2544.71s]  And I figured it would be here. Am I going to, I feel like I'm pretty overleveled though,
[2544.71s -> 2555.66s]  but this is really far in. I have a lot of souls. I don't have any heels though.
[2561.34s -> 2564.22s]  I am going to err on the side of caution, but I need to figure out because there was a lever
[2564.22s -> 2574.76s]  I could pull. Is this going to kill me if I go down here? Just do it. No heels. Just do it.
[2575.40s -> 2584.22s]  This boss is easy. Just do it. It's easy. Coward. This boss is actually easy. Fine. Black knife
[2584.22s -> 2620.74s]  assassin. Oh shit. Okay. Well, if I had a fucking flask, maybe I'm doing a shitload of damage to
[2620.74s -> 2630.60s]  him. Attack him. I do it. I'm walking the boss room for the first time. I'm not just going to
[2630.60s -> 2635.24s]  start pressing R1. I'm not just, all right, you know what? I guess I walked in the boss door.
[2635.24s -> 2639.64s]  Let's just fucking go ahead and start doing this. I mean, I'm going to die in one second. I don't
[2639.64s -> 2659.45s]  even know what he does. How do I get back there? There's another boss here. There's a second door.
[2660.01s -> 2669.24s]  You fought this guy already. Did I? I don't know. The Elden Ring is like eight games in one game,
[2669.24s -> 2697.85s]  so it's hard to remember what I did. Oh shit. Am I going to get hurt? Yeah. I mean, I may have
[2697.85s -> 2708.79s]  fought this enemy type 36 or 38 bosses ago, but I don't, I mean, it's been a while. Maybe those
[2708.79s -> 2745.14s]  souls don't hurt me. See if I can catch him in this. Ooh. Oh man. That's bad for him. All right.
[2745.14s -> 2760.50s]  Don't be a fucking idiot. Okay. He's good. You're way overleveled. I did. I'm just exploring the
[2760.50s -> 2782.46s]  areas I didn't do yet. I can miss every fucking swing. What? Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm overleveled for
[2782.46s -> 2789.72s]  this area, but it's, I haven't, I haven't been here yet. And I'm not just going to run by it.
[2797.38s -> 2802.18s]  You got, he, that guy got more hits in than the boss did. Yeah. But he was also very surprising.
[2802.82s -> 2809.37s]  Okay. That's not it though. Cause this, another not hidden boss. And what was that?
[2814.46s -> 2822.10s]  Two things that he dropped. What was it? Black knife print. Mark of the night of the
[2822.10s -> 2830.23s]  black knives ritual. On the night of the black knives, someone stole a fragment of death from
[2831.11s -> 2835.19s]  Milliketh, the black blade and imbued his power onto the assassin's dagger.
[2835.67s -> 2845.45s]  Okay. That's an item. There was another one. There was another item. So it was in one of these
[2846.66s -> 2856.60s]  was critical hits, restore FP. It doesn't seem that useful for this particular build. All right.
[2856.60s -> 2865.38s]  I can, I'm going to try this. Let's see if I die. Nope. I'm alive. Very cool. But there's a second
[2865.38s -> 2883.98s]  boss in here. I wonder if I'm going to one shot that one too. Two shot. Yeah. I was waiting for
[2883.98s -> 2894.55s]  somebody to say that. I was waiting for you to say that. It's a fun fact. George R. R. Martin wrote
[2894.55s -> 2916.78s]  every single message you see on the ground. Really? That's kind of cool. Don't kill me.
[2919.16s -> 2936.07s]  Don't kill me. That's cool. Game fact. All right. So this is this, this is just a boss. All right.
[2938.14s -> 2941.90s]  So let me actually level up first in case I embarrass myself and die to a boss. I'm probably
[2941.90s -> 2947.53s]  10 to 20 levels higher than and everyone will omega LL and make fun of me. And I'll have to
[2948.09s -> 2953.13s]  look over here and freak out and explain exactly why I died. Something about the button, the D pad,
[2953.13s -> 2958.28s]  I hit the D pad the wrong way or something. Something about the D pad. It's always about
[2958.28s -> 2968.55s]  the D pad. So all right. I can't level up. It's probably not that bad. It's probably fine.
[2968.55s -> 2996.23s]  Let's get in there and do it. Cemetery shade. Okay. All right. All right. Have you heard of
[2996.23s -> 3006.30s]  jumping R2? Oh my God. What the fuck? I didn't even mean to kill him. Am I like 100 levels too
[3006.30s -> 3017.29s]  high for this? What the fuck was that? All right. All right. But wait, but hold on.
[3017.93s -> 3026.97s]  I'm only level 89. It's not like I'm that high. And this is all right. So my game progress route,
[3027.90s -> 3039.42s]  I went like this way and then this way and then this way and this way. So let me ask you something.
[3039.42s -> 3045.10s]  It's doing the rainy witch quest line that took me like, it took me like eight to 10 hours.
[3047.51s -> 3053.59s]  Did that? Was I like, was I like under leveled for that stuff, but over leveled for this stuff?
[3053.59s -> 3066.26s]  I did Caleb too early. Really? Well, that's interesting. That's really interesting.
[3066.26s -> 3074.49s]  This stuff is like during the academy. Really? Holy shit. Well, that's cool. All right. Well,
[3074.49s -> 3084.71s]  that's still fun though. It's just a dungeon. Whatever. 100% Radan was very, way, way, way,
[3084.71s -> 3093.24s]  way, way too early. Well, that's really cool. That was sick. I like that. Let's kill this guy
[3093.24s -> 3115.93s]  in fucking two hits too. Why not? I like being really powerful. Oh, this is actually really good.
[3115.93s -> 3135.10s]  No more skin suit. No, I mean, this is fantastic. New armor. Oh no. What about the baby armor?
[3135.10s -> 3148.18s]  It's okay. That's not even where I wanted to go. I wanted to go up there. I used to have a bonfire.
[3148.18s -> 3152.58s]  Okay. I need to go down this road and bang a right. That's what we're doing because I can't,
[3152.58s -> 3164.90s]  I'm not going to be able to figure it out. Dude, you're distracting me from my Mario Kart game.
[3170.42s -> 3175.02s]  Dude, don't worry. Just get in last place and hold the blue shell until the last 10 seconds of the
[3175.02s -> 3192.78s]  game. I think you'll be all right. All right. Here we go. Is there an bird tree avatar over here?
[3193.42s -> 3204.73s]  It's a bear again. I don't want to fight the bear again. I want to get up here.
[3205.94s -> 3230.15s]  The hat. Is this thing alive? Is there like a gesture in front of it? Go get the bell, Pog.
[3233.90s -> 3248.66s]  All right. Okay. So I mean, I figured you were going to do that.
[3262.65s -> 3293.75s]  Um, again, the barnacle. Barnacles. Oh, these things. Oh, really? I feel like this stuff,
[3293.75s -> 3328.79s]  are you making that up? I'm really glad you told me that because that would have taken an hour for
[3328.79s -> 3354.92s]  me to figure out what the fuck, what the fuck is going on. Okay. So it's a building. With the
[3354.92s -> 3361.11s]  remembrance duplication menu, you can duplicate remembrances you've previously acquired. This
[3361.11s -> 3366.79s]  includes remembrances from which you've already drawn out power. Duplication can only perform
[3366.79s -> 3384.57s]  once per mausoleum. So this is boss soul stuff. So I get to have another boss soul. You can get
[3384.57s -> 3393.62s]  both boss soul items. Could I just take one of these and break it? You could do dual baby rattles.
[3394.34s -> 3400.18s]  I can just take, does this cost anything? Or you can, I can only just do it once.
[3400.90s -> 3414.42s]  So it's only one time. So where are the other ones? I killed way more than these two. Where's, um,
[3414.42s -> 3425.03s]  like Godric and Margit and stuff around the map. There are other mausoleums, different mausoleums,
[3425.03s -> 3431.35s]  different turtle. Oh, so I mean, is it worth me just breaking this and getting a hundred thousand
[3431.35s -> 3438.44s]  souls and leveling up like three times? You can't do two of the same reward. You can only do the
[3438.44s -> 3455.10s]  other one that you didn't pick. Okay. I can't do dual baby rattles. If you don't want the other
[3455.10s -> 3466.36s]  weapon. Yeah. Which I don't remember what they were in a while. There's only two of like 10
[3466.36s -> 3470.44s]  potential bosses that are here. Yeah. I probably, um, I don't think I'm going to do this yet.
[3471.32s -> 3485.66s]  That's cool though. It's really cool. What you can do dual rattles. I feel like that would be kind
[3485.66s -> 3489.10s]  of funny. And then I would be like, wow, that was 10,000 souls. And I'm going to go back to my
[3489.10s -> 3496.49s]  catalyst now, whatever this thing is, staff, whatever. There's another one right there.
[3497.13s -> 3506.10s]  All right. I need to, so that's what's in this pond. Let me mark this. I'm going to mark this as,
[3506.18s -> 3514.10s]  uh, like a jewel because I don't, I need to go to this tree. Go up to one. I need to get up to
[3514.10s -> 3533.27s]  the tree. Where's the road? Okay. I've got to go this way. Jump up the clip. Oh my goodness.
[3533.27s -> 3546.98s]  Are we okay? I think I'm okay. Yeah. I'm so paranoid about those jumps. All right. Here we go.
[3549.46s -> 3552.90s]  Now we're going to wrap around here and go this way. We're going to go to the tree.
[3553.62s -> 3567.26s]  I don't want to fight any of you. We go. I could see, I could open that too,
[3569.32s -> 3579.06s]  but bonfire bonfire somewhere. Thank you. And it's not like in a dungeon on the ground somewhere.
[3579.06s -> 3598.52s]  Thank God. All right. I need to level up. Oops. Is that a magic flail? That is a magic flail.
[3598.52s -> 3618.89s]  I still can't 47. Oh shit. Okay. Well, whatever. All right. Bird tree this way. Oh my, okay. How
[3618.89s -> 3621.93s]  do I get over there? I gotta go all the way around. There's probably a dungeon over there.
[3629.66s -> 3644.90s]  All right. Do I clean this one of the barnacles too? Not as well. Oh God. Oh God. What just
[3644.90s -> 3684.36s]  happened? Somebody threw something at me. Is it that leg? Yeah. Yep. Did I do it? What's happening?
[3685.16s -> 3708.54s]  Okay. I did it. So I'm assuming this is the same thing. I'm just going to say it is. It is. Okay.
[3708.62s -> 3711.50s]  That's really cool. So I don't need to make that decision now.
[3712.30s -> 3729.74s]  All right. Bird tree time. Let's go. Dungeon. I would have put one right here if I was a game
[3729.74s -> 3753.54s]  dev. I just want to kill the avatar here. There we go. All right. Let's kill the avatar.
[3754.26s -> 3757.38s]  Give me the shit I'm looking for. I want more of those flask things.
[3760.14s -> 3768.25s]  It shouldn't be too hard considering it's just an avatar. Spoilers for those that have not seen
[3768.25s -> 3776.01s]  one of the avatars yet. They all fall the same exact formula. They are still fun though.
[3776.57s -> 3802.76s]  Okay. Let's kill this in three hits. I mistimed that. Okay. I don't want to fuck this up
[3802.76s -> 3808.28s]  because considering I'm... I thought I was the body on the ground. I was like, why is this taking
[3808.28s -> 3815.22s]  me fucking forever to get up? I thought I was the guy on the ground. That was another body.
[3834.17s -> 3874.97s]  I'm getting so greedy. Oh fuck. I'm gonna die. Really? Fuck you. What is this reach?
[3876.34s -> 3904.39s]  Your reach is too high. I'm out of heals. Oh my god. What am I doing? I'm dead. I'm just like...
[3906.55s -> 3910.47s]  I'm like so leveled for this area that I'm just like, I don't care. Whatever. Just hit me.
[3913.74s -> 3918.82s]  Like I have to... I can't just like run into the guy and just swing at him. I'm just like,
[3918.82s -> 3923.38s]  yeah, whatever. I'm fucking way higher than you. I'm just gonna fucking walk into you.
[3973.88s -> 3978.20s]  Will you get the fuck out of here? Like seriously, like get away from me.
[3981.43s -> 3984.71s]  I was... That guy just made... That guy just pissed me off the way he was looking at me.
[3985.27s -> 4016.44s]  Good again. Come on. Okay. I didn't like the way the guy was looking at me. What do I get for this?
[4019.38s -> 4023.86s]  Magic Shrouding Crack Tear. Lightning Shrouding Crack Tear. Holy Shrouding. All right.
[4023.86s -> 4047.42s]  One of those actually might be really good. Where is it? Oh, right here. Okay. What is it?
[4048.06s -> 4059.35s]  Boost Magic Attacks? I kind of want to try it. Fire Attack, Lightning Attack, Magic Attack.
[4059.83s -> 4076.07s]  Does that work for this? Might be pretty good. How is it? We're good. I'm good on time.
[4079.37s -> 4090.30s]  That's the Erd Tree. That's good. Imagine that on a weapon. That would be... I wonder how much
[4090.30s -> 4107.24s]  it increases it because that would be good for my L2. All right. So that was the Erd Tree.
[4108.42s -> 4113.82s]  I went here. I still want to go here. And now I'm actually... Okay. I can actually get over there
[4113.82s -> 4125.11s]  now. Go to five first. Fuck, it's still higher. Wait, this way. The physical effects are strong.
[4125.75s -> 4151.96s]  How do I get up here? Over here? Maybe I have to go all the way around?
[4166.90s -> 4184.12s]  From the Flame Village, really? It looks like I can go this way. All the way around here or from here?
[4185.00s -> 4201.19s]  How high up is this fucking thing? I can see it, but I can't get to it. All the way around?
[4214.25s -> 4248.89s]  Fuck. I missed it. I really want to get up there. Maybe it is from the Flame Village. You're right.
[4249.53s -> 4258.52s]  You have to go in from the north. Let's try that. Because that's probably a sacred tier.
[4258.52s -> 4295.06s]  It's probably a church. All the way around? Oh my lord. Go over the tree? Oh, do you mean
[4295.06s -> 4297.86s]  physically go over the tree? Or do you mean like, you know, go over the tree. Like,
[4298.58s -> 4305.53s]  examine the tree. I thought you meant go over the tree. Like, you got to examine the tree.
[4305.53s -> 4314.15s]  I don't think that's right. You were just being like a weirdo saying to like go on the tree.
[4314.15s -> 4328.07s]  Okay, I'm just going to keep going all the way. All right. So dude, how fucking much rock is
[4328.07s -> 4352.89s]  around this place? How do I get out of here? Cross examine the tree. I, dude, I don't even know how to
[4352.89s -> 4362.22s]  how to physically get up there again. You know what I'm saying? Like, how did I even, what was it?
[4362.22s -> 4369.98s]  Go to the village? I think I'm, I came, the village is up here. I can't, I don't think I can even go
[4369.98s -> 4374.94s]  there anymore. Unless there's like a specific random way that I have to go. It's all blocked
[4374.94s -> 4388.50s]  off by a giant wall. Like this is like, I can't go around this. How do I do it? Maybe I have to go
[4388.50s -> 4399.37s]  all the way from here. I go from here. I'm gonna go over here because I think I actually went down
[4399.37s -> 4405.27s]  and this, I don't think it's a way to get back up. Now if I wrap around, how do I get, let's see.
[4411.98s -> 4419.74s]  How do I approach this? I go up here. So I guess I'm going to go up. What's the number? Is that
[4420.22s -> 4455.51s]  three? Okay. So I got, this is a million feet in the air. This is way higher than I thought it
[4455.51s -> 4466.26s]  was going to be. That's, that's a million. That's, that's at least a hundred thousand feet in the air.
[4468.79s -> 4493.93s]  No. Holy shit. And then I got to bang a right up here. I hope there's a bonfire up there. All right.
[4493.93s -> 4517.13s]  There's that. There's Jesus. It's the back of the town lore. It's in the back of the lore town.
[4521.05s -> 4526.58s]  I haven't seen this, whatever this is. This is new, whatever it is.
[4527.38s -> 4552.12s]  Well, this is, oh no, this is the lore town. Okay. So I'd go this way. I'm trying to just
[4552.12s -> 4565.29s]  take a look and see what, do I have to jump on that and walk around and jump off there?
[4566.01s -> 4572.38s]  I think that's what, that's what I have to do. I have to go through the town.
[4573.10s -> 4593.86s]  Holy shit. There's one fucking specific way to get here. Okay. I'm in the town. I want to go
[4594.82s -> 4612.84s]  this way. Like up here. This looks correct. That is okay. All right. Holy my God.
[4613.56s -> 4626.66s]  That was a pain in the ass. Lord Vike, it seems that you were no Lord after all. Then where is
[4626.66s -> 4632.30s]  he? Our true Lord, our Lord frenzied flame. We beg of you, incinerate all the divides and
[4632.30s -> 4637.14s]  distinguishes. May chaos take the world. All right. I'm looking for that guy too.
[4637.86s -> 4648.66s]  This is a brainless German woman. Look at the map. There's one way to get here. You
[4648.66s -> 4654.50s]  can't get here from any other fucking direction. Not a single other direction, but right here.
[4655.22s -> 4682.15s]  That's it. That's it. You drinking piece of shit. Don't you know how leveled I am?
[4693.77s -> 4715.83s]  Fingerprint grape and a war spear. This is a faith weapon. So I see it. Ooh.
[4721.02s -> 4731.35s]  Can't do the ability, unfortunately. That's a cool weapon though. All right. Give me the church.
[4731.35s -> 4739.18s]  For those of you that haven't been watching Elden Ring streams and were tricked by the
[4739.18s -> 4743.18s]  Mario tennis stream. German doesn't read chat. He just threatens to put people in meat grinders
[4743.18s -> 4755.00s]  every few hours and rubs his eyes because he plays the game for too long. I love how you were
[4755.00s -> 4760.39s]  tricked by Mario tennis. Yeah. That's what I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to get,
[4760.39s -> 4767.75s]  I'm going to funnel them all in. With Mario, by the way, golf, it wasn't tennis.
[4768.55s -> 4773.13s]  I'm going to bait and switch them into Elden Ring where I go like this for the next four hours.
[4781.51s -> 4800.90s]  Fuck you. Fuck you. You got fucking baited. Ooh. Nothing special on this. Just looks interesting.
[4808.44s -> 4834.82s]  Finger maiden robe. Okay. Yes. Let's get to 40 vigor. All right. That was worth coming all
[4834.82s -> 4841.94s]  the way up here. Although I mean, this map doesn't really help to explain that there's only one way
[4841.94s -> 4850.95s]  to get here and everywhere else is a gigantic mountain cliff. But I digress. I want to go over
[4850.95s -> 4864.41s]  here or do I want to, you know, you know what? No, no, no. I want to go across this bridge.
[4865.05s -> 4880.33s]  All right. Use the tier. That's smart. And I'm going to do the flask as well.
[4881.13s -> 4895.90s]  I have any more of these? Hey. All right. I think I want to do the magic one and see how good it is
[4895.90s -> 4905.50s]  and the heel or the damage negation. Yeah. You can't go wrong with that. I'm very curious how,
[4905.50s -> 4919.14s]  how good this is. I don't be that stupid. Okay. So I want to go on the main road. We're going to do
[4919.14s -> 4930.34s]  main progress. Main progress. Although I think I went the wrong way. Wait, there's a merchant here.
[4940.71s -> 4953.69s]  You got kind of a dog shit inventory. Yeah. Your inventory kind of sucks. All right. Is there a
[4953.69s -> 4977.13s]  better way I can go through the church? We're going right through the gate. Okay. I just,
[4977.13s -> 4982.52s]  somebody said, Jerma, if I was in school with you, I would be, I would bully you. Oh yeah.
[4983.40s -> 4993.02s]  Oh, you think so, huh? Oh, you think so. Did you, you weren't here when you talked about how,
[4993.02s -> 5001.53s]  when I told you how fast I was. Oh, give me your lunch money. Dodge. Come here, you little bastard.
[5001.53s -> 5025.82s]  Dodge. Get behind you. Wedge. Where's my weapon? This looks cool. Holy shit. I want to take this in.
[5025.82s -> 5059.30s]  Don't rush me. Oh, what's this place? Greece. This is a big castle. Have I been here before?
[5059.30s -> 5078.26s]  I think I was at the back part of this, right? He's finally here. He finally made it. Uh,
[5078.26s -> 5085.48s]  I don't think this is the end of the game considering, um, all this. So no, I, I doubt
[5085.48s -> 5095.91s]  this is the very end of the game. I could be wrong. Is there somewhere, another path leading back to
[5095.91s -> 5115.37s]  the foot of the urn tree? An ancient tunnel. Huh? I'm about 70%. That's what I figured.
[5116.25s -> 5144.97s]  Ran. Boys and girls, I came prepared. I came incredibly prepared. I got both halves of these
[5144.97s -> 5184.90s]  medallions. The whole thing's going up. You didn't take the tunnel? Well, I mean, there's two ways to
[5184.90s -> 5193.78s]  go, I guess. I collected the two halves of this medallion across the world, so I get to do the
[5193.78s -> 5200.17s]  skip. I get my Disney Fastpass. You got to sit in line at Space Mountain for like fucking four hours.
[5215.70s -> 5229.74s]  Damn. Where the hell am I? These, those guys are out, out his plateau. All right.
[5232.65s -> 5239.54s]  When everyone has a Fastpass, no one will have one. Yeah, I mean, they do times now, right?
[5241.66s -> 5245.50s]  Didn't it used to be if you had a Fastpass, you just walked into the line. There was a Fastpass
[5245.50s -> 5253.96s]  lane. You just walked in it. That didn't last very long, did it? See, now it's like, when do you want
[5253.96s -> 5260.38s]  to ride the Millennium Falcon ride? Uh, how does like 415 sound? And you come back at 415 and you're
[5260.38s -> 5270.46s]  getting another line, right? But it's like faster. This is really, really pretty. Sometimes the
[5270.46s -> 5274.94s]  Fastpass is just as long. Are I going to kill these guys? Or am I going to get, am I going to get
[5274.94s -> 5290.30s]  a shit on here? Let's find out about how much trouble these guys were giving me like 12 hours
[5290.30s -> 5298.33s]  ago, 20 hours ago in game. I tried to fight one of these guys. Overleveled Andy. Um, look, I did,
[5298.33s -> 5304.41s]  I explored the world of the Elden Ring, okay? Just because I might be a little overleveled.
[5304.65s -> 5313.62s]  It was exploring the world of the Lands Between. I got every tourist attraction hat.
[5314.42s -> 5322.52s]  I got every mug from every part of Disney World. I would love to get over there.
[5336.33s -> 5350.66s]  Overleveled. Giants are not aggressive. I have like four of those. A map fragment would be
[5350.66s -> 5370.17s]  Pog right now. Looks like Fall here. Map fragment. Not on this map. Damn, okay, well, just keep on.
[5370.17s -> 5374.09s]  Overleveled, underscaled. Actually, I've been doing pretty well in this game so far.
[5374.97s -> 5396.57s]  You can go see the VODs. You can read the logs. What's this? Oh my god, an alien! Did he just
[5396.57s -> 5402.50s]  shoot himself in the head with his arrow? What did he just do? I think he just shot himself in the
[5402.50s -> 5428.52s]  head with his bow and arrow. I didn't hit him. Oh, I did. Am I a bit overleveled? I don't think so.
[5429.48s -> 5444.57s]  But I've been exploring the Lands of Elden Ring. I spent two days in Limgrave. It was a lot of fun.
[5445.29s -> 5466.95s]  Oh, I want to try this thing. The cheese overpowered Andy. This is the first time I've
[5466.95s -> 5473.32s]  ever seen this place. I'll tell you, it was a witch quest. I got so obsessed with it and it
[5473.32s -> 5479.08s]  ended up taking like, it took like a full 10-hour day to beat the witch quest. I leveled up like
[5479.08s -> 5489.38s]  20 times doing the witch quest. I'm not, you're not, I'm not overleveled. All right. Yeah, I'm
[5489.38s -> 5500.52s]  not overleveled. I'm fine. I just have a really strong weapon. I'll take a map fragment, please.
[5501.08s -> 5510.70s]  Yeah, I slingshot myself. I did the witch quest way too early and it was really difficult. And I
[5510.70s -> 5515.42s]  like went to Radan wicked early and way, way too early. And then I got a shitload of souls from
[5515.42s -> 5533.11s]  doing that. Wham. And I launched myself into the stratosphere. This is great though. Is that a map
[5533.11s -> 5538.63s]  thingy right there? Yes. There's one here and there's one here. Let's get them both.
[5539.27s -> 5558.07s]  You were overleveled for Radan. And now I know that's bait bullshit. Now I know that that's
[5558.07s -> 5586.04s]  bait bullshit. Old Fang? Okay. Nobody is overleveled for Radan. That's true.
[5586.76s -> 5593.43s]  Oh, urd tree. Great urd tree. The golden order itself unwavering stretched to the sky.
[5594.07s -> 5598.71s]  Confer your guidance to our Elden Lord to put this weary world to rights.
[5599.35s -> 5616.94s]  We're getting close to this thing. Is Radan still your least favorite boss? Yeah, without a doubt.
[5616.94s -> 5633.69s]  One of the game's hardest bosses. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I, it was a cool idea,
[5634.49s -> 5637.61s]  but I don't know. I'd rather just fight the guy instead of just running around like a dickhead
[5637.61s -> 5648.66s]  with like a thousand summons. Anyway, I guess you can, but it'd be hard. All right. Urd tree in the
[5648.66s -> 5660.87s]  middle. Dungeon here. Thing here. Urd tree. Oh my god, I'm gonna throw up on stream. And then
[5660.87s -> 5690.28s]  whatever this is. All right, let's begin. Ooh. Ooh, what's that? Is that one of those tortoise
[5690.28s -> 5701.77s]  missions? I don't, I don't want to do a tortoise mission right now. What's going on there?
[5711.74s -> 5738.86s]  Do you fucking die? What is this big banner? Ah, hello. Do you take your fingers and go like that?
[5738.86s -> 5762.79s]  Like here? What? What? Moons of gold. I don't know. I'm just imagining like, let me read them.
[5765.50s -> 5787.80s]  Ah, yes. To the west of that, right? All right. So what you're saying is getting that cast on
[5787.80s -> 5802.79s]  slay the goddamn demon. You can do that. All right. We have some things to look at here first.
[5803.51s -> 5822.18s]  I hear a merchant. Merchant? I heard like the, ah, there you are.
[5832.86s -> 5845.11s]  You got way better stuff. Breezer coat, frosty tower shield, scorpion kite shield.
[5848.46s -> 5865.82s]  Damn. Did I get some of this cookbook stuff? Imp shades, unseen assassins, ancient dragon's
[5865.82s -> 5877.58s]  apostle cookbook. That sounds important. You got great stuff. What are you talking about?
[5877.58s -> 5884.33s]  You got some of the best stuff I've seen so far. All right. Where's this going to take me?
[5884.89s -> 5910.60s]  What did that unlock? Anything cool? Not really. Hmm. That's actually a really good tip.
[5910.60s -> 5948.18s]  Somebody said I can hit X on it and it'll show me. That's kind of where I wanted to go. East
[5948.18s -> 5976.10s]  windmill pastor. Can I dance too? Ah, I didn't even do anything. What the? Why are you mad at me?
[5976.10s -> 5997.85s]  I actually didn't do anything. Fuck the whole goddamn group then. Oops. That's not a heal
[5997.85s -> 6019.29s]  anymore. Okay, cool. That was weird. What were you playing with? Wind, night swords. What's that?
[6021.64s -> 6034.50s]  Wind, night swords, strength scaling. Oh, it's a, it's a Darth Maul dual handed spinning attacks.
[6040.38s -> 6054.50s]  Yep. I always wanted to use one of these in these souls games, like the Albert's or like the spinners
[6054.82s -> 6067.91s]  things you hold in two hands and spin around like poles. You should respect not this late
[6067.91s -> 6075.02s]  into the game. I've got the thing going on here. That was really cool. All right. So what's the
[6075.02s -> 6086.50s]  point with the windmill? I've got to jump on it, right? Well, like attack it. I'm going to jump on
[6086.50s -> 6109.88s]  it. You definitely get on it. I'll be shocked if you didn't actually get on this somehow. I guess
[6109.88s -> 6130.65s]  not. No way in what's the significance of this thing? I don't know. Oh, there's just a ton of
[6130.65s -> 6142.73s]  these. Nevermind. Nevermind. I'm going to go, we're going to go to the urd tree and we're going
[6142.73s -> 6154.38s]  that way. I got cool clothes. Yeah. I'll take, I'll look at them in a minute. Let me go get this
[6154.38s -> 6177.72s]  avatar. It's one of those golden bugs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't go away. Protection of
[6177.72s -> 6187.19s]  the urd tree. That's a faith spell. Bro, look at the new clothes. I will just wait. What's this?
[6187.19s -> 6213.56s]  What's on the door? Okay. What'd I get? Increase his mind. How many is here? Yeah. That is a mana
[6213.56s -> 6219.64s]  hood. Although I don't think, I think having the intellect from the cat helmet is better.
[6220.92s -> 6237.10s]  All right, urd tree. Let's go. Did you find the Elden Ring? Uh, I did. It's this. It's just,
[6237.10s -> 6241.82s]  this is a big circle and the Elden Ring is going to be the lands that the Elden Lords used to occupy.
[6242.62s -> 6247.72s]  And it's going to be a huge thing at the end of the game when there's no thing for you to take.
[6247.72s -> 6253.24s]  It's not like, oh, the Elden Ring. No, no, bro. Nothing's, it's not all about material shit.
[6254.57s -> 6261.32s]  That's the message they're going to give us. It's the Elden Ring of the lands. It's the land.
[6262.55s -> 6266.55s]  Not the, oh, it's a big shiny thing you put on your finger. Nope. It's the land.
[6271.67s -> 6287.46s]  Oh, I want to go to the tree. That's cool. Whatever that is. Ooh, ruins. That means there's a dungeon.
[6288.18s -> 6298.54s]  It's just an onion ring. That's a fucking person. I thought that was a decoration.
[6302.25s -> 6313.42s]  Death blighted? Dude, look, I just want to get this bug, but I'm dead. What, he didn't kill me.
[6335.30s -> 6365.19s]  What the fuck is that? That's not an avatar. That's not an urd tree avatar. Is it? Get over here.
[6365.19s -> 6395.70s]  What's this laggy glitch shit? Golden Slam. Okay. I guess these guys freak me out. I don't like these
[6395.70s -> 6408.04s]  guys. I'm going to, they don't like the sounds they make either. These guys make terrible sounds.
[6408.92s -> 6428.33s]  Well, there's definitely a dungeon, so let's find it. I hate that thing. Where is there?
[6431.05s -> 6473.94s]  There has to be, right? There's got to be a way down. Are they on top of it? Here. Where's this guy
[6473.94s -> 6484.28s]  going? No, dude. Dude, don't go over here. You don't want to go over here. Is he alive? Follow him.
[6484.28s -> 6503.96s]  He's walking into a bunch of minions. I don't want to go over this way. They're not happy. Just go,
[6503.96s -> 6513.64s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Where are you going? Dude, we've got company behind this. I don't,
[6513.64s -> 6519.00s]  you know what? Don't look behind you. I'll handle everything. Just walk like normally. Don't worry.
[6519.00s -> 6534.65s]  Nothing's wrong. What? Oh, that's an instant kill. It's an instant kill move. I forgot. I mean,
[6534.65s -> 6540.17s]  the bar is gray, so it kind of, it blends into there. He's freaking mad at video games and he
[6540.17s -> 6549.16s]  sucks. I don't like him. You know what I mean though? Why am I this far away? Where did this
[6549.16s -> 6583.80s]  just put me? Wait, item down here. Oh, golden arrows. That's probably good. Use the teleporter.
[6583.80s -> 6589.74s]  I kind of wanted to see what was down here. All right. How scared are these guys should I actually
[6591.35s -> 6596.95s]  be? And by the way, I'm going to watch this guy from afar. I'm not going to follow behind him.
[6597.67s -> 6617.48s]  I'll watch this guy who's fucking binoculars. Okay. Where was it? Why is it so magical looking
[6617.48s -> 6627.70s]  right here? Why is that so magical looking? It's just very magical. Why is it so magical looking?
[6637.88s -> 6647.96s]  All right. Where was that? That was back here. Touch that thing and I'm going to literally just
[6647.96s -> 6668.20s]  watch him from afar. All right. Go ahead. Go do your thing. Okay. He walks through these people.
[6669.00s -> 6696.39s]  Oh, I think this might be the Elden Lord. Now where are you going? This would be actually really
[6696.39s -> 6702.52s]  funny. I followed this guy for like five minutes and he goes behind a tree and takes a piss and
[6702.52s -> 6759.85s]  then just vanishes. Okay. Well, get where you're going, man. What is this guy doing? Dude,
[6760.17s -> 6794.33s]  we're walking to like the edge of the earth. Okay. He turned. We're going right here, aren't we?
[6794.33s -> 6802.04s]  We're literally going over there, aren't we? It was already marked on my map. I didn't even need
[6802.04s -> 6817.30s]  this guy. He's leading you. It's a dungeon. He's literally going to walk into it and he's going to
[6817.30s -> 6836.12s]  point. I was going to come here anyways. Well, we're here. Might as well pay him, not paying him.
[6842.07s -> 6869.14s]  Pay him. That's kind of cool though. Can I go down? Altus tunnel. What have we got? Dungeon.
[6869.14s -> 6872.73s]  This looks like another smithing stone tunnel.
[6879.16s -> 6880.74s]  Overleveled Andy coming through.
[6885.14s -> 6887.46s]  I should take a rune arc too, just to add insult to injury.
[6888.34s -> 6895.48s]  Just walk around here with a rune arc and just be unbeatable. Unstoppable.
[6913.00s -> 6932.55s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is this thing? I think I've seen a version of those.
[6933.75s -> 6941.54s]  Crystals, crystals, crystals, crystals, crystals. All right. What about, can I get up here?
[6943.56s -> 6970.09s]  It's going to be those shrimp things here, right? I actually do need these. So this is
[6970.09s -> 6985.11s]  bad. This is not bad. This is great. Do you get the urge to play Luigi's Mansion from this game?
[6985.11s -> 6997.53s]  Not really. Imagine if I still use the katana. I would kill these guys all in one hit.
[6998.33s -> 7012.57s]  All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't be an idiot. I don't know what that was behind me,
[7012.57s -> 7027.06s]  but something happened. What is it making? Is it you? Oh Jesus. It's one of those things.
[7047.88s -> 7055.03s]  Walk through the wall for like five straight seconds. Okay. Let me go this way.
[7057.19s -> 7077.37s]  He's a smithing stone. Five nerds rope strikes again. Yeah. I don't want to miss anything.
[7077.37s -> 7083.67s]  See my problem with games like this, especially like Elden Ring. This one in particular
[7085.40s -> 7089.32s]  is I, I want to see all the cool stuff and I know that I can play another character
[7090.68s -> 7094.68s]  and just go the ways that I didn't go, but I just, I want everything. I want all the items.
[7094.68s -> 7097.96s]  I want all the stuff. I want all the gear. I, even if it's not for me,
[7099.43s -> 7103.59s]  I want the strength ring. I want the strength talisman. I just want it. Give it to me.
[7104.15s -> 7114.34s]  What about a new game? Yeah. I mean, but I want it now and you've skipped half the stuff already.
[7114.34s -> 7119.45s]  Isn't that interesting? It's how you know that there's so much to do in this game
[7120.09s -> 7123.27s]  that you could play through this probably five times. These are alive.
[7124.39s -> 7151.51s]  All right. Well, let's kill this boss. Make it quick. It is. Oh no, it's one of those
[7153.75s -> 7173.93s]  things. I need to parry this. Do I have a shield equipped? I don't. Maybe not. It depends on how
[7173.93s -> 7221.03s]  much damage I'm doing. Hmm. I'd still like to pay like this. Not worth it. I need to parry this.
[7221.03s -> 7242.25s]  I need a shield equipped. Ooh, excuse me. Holy shit. I killed them. I instantly killed them.
[7265.77s -> 7280.81s]  Somber stone miners, bell bearing. They take a ton from crits. Seems like it. Cool. Don't want
[7280.81s -> 7294.86s]  the katana? No, I like the baby rattle. I think it's really good. God, I hate one hit moves. Hey,
[7294.86s -> 7305.08s]  it's only fair that I get them too. Only on one or two enemies. I think. Was that it? I can imagine
[7305.08s -> 7321.64s]  my frustration if I was here 10 levels ago, but just get fucking absolutely stomped. This weapon
[7321.64s -> 7335.94s]  is called the bastard's stars. That's a cool dungeon. So now let's go here. So this is pointing
[7335.94s -> 7351.08s]  me this way. I wonder if it's this area here. Up here. We're going to go there eventually. All
[7351.08s -> 7365.11s]  right. Let's let me check this place out first because I'm right here. There's also these ruins,
[7365.11s -> 7376.36s]  but I want to see what this is. Oh, a fucking gigantic brick wall. Never mind. Do the urtree
[7376.36s -> 7402.62s]  boss. I am right here. I'll try it. I only have two. I didn't sit down. Shit. I already got it.
[7408.87s -> 7431.99s]  Is this the boss or is this the boss? Worm is actually his name's worm face. Oh, I hate this
[7431.99s -> 7470.86s]  guy. Oh my God. I did so much fucking damage. I got distracted. I got distracted. I did do
[7470.86s -> 7505.11s]  so much damage. You just did more. All right. Kill them before you do a move. I'm going,
[7505.11s -> 7545.83s]  I gotta stay away. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't grab me. You're almost dead.
[7546.31s -> 7574.54s]  Okay. Really nice. Very good. Cool. He used magic. Pogchamp. That was cool. Oh, I can go in here
[7574.54s -> 7583.53s]  though. Wait, I could have always gone in there. Yes. All right. I've been here. All right. Let's
[7583.53s -> 7593.59s]  keep going. I want to look at those tiers, but I want to go the direction of, I want to go up.
[7594.23s -> 7608.42s]  I want to go this way towards five. Why is the stream quality weird? You didn't change it from
[7608.42s -> 7627.48s]  1080p from Mario. What do you mean? It was 864. It was always 864. All right. I think I can jump
[7627.48s -> 7657.08s]  up this. All right. Okay. That looks, that's where I want to go. That's going to take me to. All
[7657.08s -> 7665.14s]  right. That's what this bullshit is from. That's the urn tree. That's the big urn tree. I actually,
[7665.14s -> 7670.79s]  I really want to see this. I want to know what that's, what the secret is. I want to know what
[7670.79s -> 7677.32s]  it is. I guarantee you, I guarantee you we're going to get down there. I'm going to beat the
[7677.32s -> 7696.01s]  game and shit. And you're going to come out the birth canal. I'm telling you. Okay. Don't be a
[7696.01s -> 7701.19s]  fucking idiot. You might be overleveled weirdo. What am I kidding? Who cares? These guys can't hurt
[7702.71s -> 7713.34s]  me. But if they work together, they can blast. They're working together. Alone, I could destroy
[7713.34s -> 7734.14s]  them all, but together they're strong. Villain arc. That's literally a villain's speech. I mean,
[7734.70s -> 7751.85s]  I'm just speaking factual information. Ooh, that's good. Where is this on the map? Well,
[7751.85s -> 7762.31s]  I'm going the way. I'm, I don't want to go this way. Do I? Yeah, I do. I just want to see it.
[7769.30s -> 7796.42s]  Capital outskirts. What's the point of this game? Um, this is one of those ever jails right there.
[7806.78s -> 7817.18s]  He's back. Wait, why is he back? I don't want to fight this dickhead again.
[7818.06s -> 7825.29s]  Oh, tarnished. I'm back as a regular enemy because you're going to kick the shit out of
[7825.29s -> 7848.25s]  me and probably four swings. Nope. No, I'm not going to kill him in four swings. I got to remember
[7848.81s -> 7853.93s]  how to fight against Margaret, which it's been like, it's been like two weeks.
[7876.22s -> 7942.81s]  No, that was so much. It was so greedy to do that. Let's get funky and get funky. Get funky.
[7950.02s -> 7953.46s]  Ooh, 905 damage. That was a lot. See you later, Margaret.
[7954.42s -> 7980.65s]  Now what? Viridian Amber Medallion plus one. What's that? Greatly raises maximum stamina.
[7980.65s -> 7993.93s]  That's kind of a big deal. 13. Was it 13%? He's probably going to come back again.
[7994.87s -> 8005.02s]  Maybe. That was cool though. I want that map fragment before I do anything else.
[8014.55s -> 8031.02s]  I think I have enough in the map. I'm going to the. Yes, I am. You missed the guy on the ground.
[8047.48s -> 8090.02s]  Jesus, that was a, that was a elaborate move. Open your game facts window. Hit him.
[8090.74s -> 8167.03s]  What is this hitbox? Yeah. Dude, his hitbox is so weird. It's like, I feel like I'm like swing,
[8167.03s -> 8185.08s]  like just like his body that threw his fucking loincloth. Oh my God. What the fuck did you just
[8185.08s -> 8197.46s]  put me? Explain the birth canal comment. The birth canal comment was very simple.
[8198.18s -> 8204.92s]  Like you're a baby waking up. One of these days I'm going to be right about the baby waking up
[8204.92s -> 8211.96s]  comment and you, I'm going to scream when you know it. It's going to be like, oh, this is,
[8211.96s -> 8218.34s]  we have, we, we're alive now. We're the baby waking up. I think I'm in trouble here. Can I
[8218.34s -> 8244.36s]  get down here from there? Uh-uh. Maybe I can go backwards. Can I go from here? This is a lip. I
[8244.36s -> 8273.90s]  can't operate it yet. I jump on this dragon thing yet. Oh, I'm right here too. Really? Oh,
[8314.23s -> 8323.96s]  it even did the, just you die no matter what. Oh my God. This is a fucking disaster.
[8362.04s -> 8372.14s]  Can I walk there from here? Turn the fucking camera off. I'm being a
[8372.14s -> 8395.29s]  weirdo with camera on the camera. I don't want it on. Wait at the bottom of Len Dell,
[8395.29s -> 8408.49s]  frenzied flame Lord. That's where it just was. So this is Len Dell underneath Len Dell.
[8409.13s -> 8421.13s]  That's kind of cool. All right, let's start the trek all the fucking way back.
[8423.45s -> 8447.98s]  Number two on big wall. Um, I think I have to go all the way around. It doesn't matter. I have
[8447.98s -> 8513.56s]  to go from that bonfire. Okay. Down this road, just follow the road. I'm not going off the road. No
[8513.56s -> 8519.90s]  matter what, just follow the road. No matter what, I'm not going off the road unless for a grace.
[8519.90s -> 8551.06s]  No matter what, only for a grace. If I see one on the road, so far so good. I'm very happy with this
[8551.06s -> 8582.01s]  outcome. Okay. Good. Things are going good. Watch out for the, they throw shit at you now. Where
[8582.01s -> 8592.44s]  did that come from? I got to go fight that guy. I want to go kill that thing. I do need to find a
[8592.44s -> 8597.51s]  bonfire through here though. I want to fight that winged guy. I didn't want to kill it this time.
[8597.51s -> 8602.90s]  And I got pretty close. It's just, I got all screwed up. I was a cool fight. I want to fight
[8602.90s -> 8612.87s]  that thing again. How did I not touch this? How is it possible that I missed this? Was I just so
[8612.87s -> 8626.54s]  just dumbstruck by how cool this world was? How did I miss this? That's impossible. Okay. That makes
[8626.54s -> 8635.35s]  this a million times easier. This wants me to go over here, but I'm not doing that yet. I need that
[8635.35s -> 8641.22s]  map fragment. I lost 50,000 souls, whatever it is. It's fine. I'm going to fight this thing.
[8646.73s -> 8682.86s]  This guy back here. I'm going to get him. You'll see. Let's go. Where is he? Where is he? Only R1s.
[8683.66s -> 8732.02s]  Oh, come on. Not this shit again. God, man. Fucking relax.
[8814.70s -> 8817.90s]  All right. What'd you drop? What do you got? Gargoyles great axe.
[8818.62s -> 8836.58s]  There's only three 2500 souls. That's it. That's it. Is that another seed? Seed, seed, seed, seed,
[8838.15s -> 8845.00s]  seed. There's another one right here. Then two. Why they just, they give, they give me these way
[8845.00s -> 8876.54s]  like candy right now. Oh shit. I missed one up here, but I missed one touch the grace.
[8877.10s -> 8888.15s]  It's all the way back up. Oh, okay. So is this the last area or no, there's more here. There's
[8888.15s -> 8903.08s]  something else right here. Oh, there's a lot more. Wow. This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous.
[8904.04s -> 8918.79s]  There's a ton more underground too. I had two flasks. I had eight golden seeds. Are you shitting
[8918.79s -> 8936.79s]  me? I didn't know that. Ten and two. That sounds good. All right. I'm very curious. Look at this.
[8936.79s -> 8955.24s]  Okay. Is this shit down here? All right. I think I want to find the way to connect this just to have
[8955.24s -> 8963.88s]  the bonfire and connect it. So I'm going to keep going through here because I, I want to find
[8963.88s -> 8975.42s]  the connection here. I'm assuming I'm going to be going this way. Not this way. Um, wait, this way.
[8975.42s -> 9000.26s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, through the doors. I'm already going this way. All right. So if I go
[9000.26s -> 9013.03s]  up here, because I already have a bonfire, that's all the way up. Is this what you're saying? I
[9013.03s -> 9043.61s]  missed one. I did miss one. That's crazy. Okay. This way. All right. Let's go. What the hell are
[9043.61s -> 9062.97s]  you guys even doing here anymore? Damn it. They're just chilling. What? Why they just get out of
[9062.97s -> 9098.54s]  here. Okay. Can I open the front door? Lost ashes of war. I definitely cannot go in this way. So
[9098.54s -> 9104.47s]  there's two ways I can go down to the lake or up and around by the tree. And we're going to go to
[9104.47s -> 9108.95s]  the tree anyways, because I want to get the, I want more of the flash shit we're going to wrap
[9108.95s -> 9121.77s]  around here. I'm going to check out what's going on in this little thing here. Oh, I'm fine.
[9126.28s -> 9173.46s]  Let's go. How's the radish garden going? Um, it's not, it's going pretty good.
[9174.26s -> 9185.35s]  That's holding a box. That guy was holding a 12 golden rune. That guy had just a treasure chest.
[9218.36s -> 9249.03s]  Hey, we're trying to stun them. Use the nebula, bro. Be one with the stars.
[9253.30s -> 9261.51s]  All right. You too. Do use the nebula, bro. Be one with the stars. That's my favorite part
[9262.15s -> 9288.79s]  of what you just said. Okay. Up. Ah, I can go up here. Nebula is only good when I'm very
[9288.79s -> 9294.30s]  confident that I can get its utilization down. Can't just do it just nilly nilly.
[9304.74s -> 9319.86s]  What the fuck is that? Stop. All right. What's up here? I'm weird. Something interesting.
[9320.42s -> 9329.14s]  I'm probably right in the middle.
[9338.92s -> 9368.39s]  The skulls are alive. I guarantee if I come back here at midnight,
[9368.39s -> 9374.30s]  it's going to be a giant skull boss thing here. This is a, you fight something here.
[9374.30s -> 9403.90s]  There's no way you don't guide Andy. Nope. I'm just telling you. That's what I think happens.
[9404.82s -> 9425.06s]  It might not happen, but that's what I think. Ooh, that's not even from a nerd tree. Okay.
[9425.78s -> 9430.68s]  Let's I got to, I got to investigate that shit. What's going on down there.
[9431.32s -> 9442.31s]  It's like a little congregation down there. I'm going, let's go. Is that the urtree boss?
[9442.31s -> 9444.95s]  I don't know what that is, but I want to go. Come on, come on, come on. I want to go now.
[9444.95s -> 9462.06s]  I want to go now. I don't want to wait. Okay. Here we go. What's going on down here.
[9462.70s -> 9510.18s]  It is an urtree boss. What was that? What the fuck? Not too much trouble. What do we got?
[9510.18s -> 9525.26s]  That's it? Okay. Easy. Yep. Golden sunflower. Oh, that's not the item.
[9526.28s -> 9539.94s]  Twiggy cracked tier. Crimson crystal tier. Dungeon. No, I got to look at what these,
[9539.94s -> 9548.15s]  some of these are. This guy's cracked out. I'm getting a little tired, but I wouldn't say I'm,
[9548.15s -> 9553.75s]  I think I'm the reverse of cracked out right now. I think I cracked out all my potential crack
[9554.55s -> 9560.25s]  during the rain age portion of the stream, which was sapped me of all my brain cells.
[9560.89s -> 9567.00s]  Oh, okay. That's giant. Very cool. There's definitely a dungeon down here.
[9575.61s -> 9591.42s]  Absolutely a dungeon over here somewhere on the edge somewhere. Come on.
[9591.42s -> 9598.26s]  It's gotta be one. Come on. Dungeon finding Daniel. Yeah. It's one of the coolest parts
[9598.26s -> 9601.78s]  of the whole game. It is in fact, probably the coolest part of the whole game.
[9609.77s -> 9639.83s]  All right. Well, you have to stop that now. Oh, he's shooting now where he is. All of you stop.
[9640.71s -> 9695.59s]  Oh, please. 1875 damage. Now let's kill this guy. These legs are blocked. We have to play this
[9695.59s -> 9706.17s]  smartly. Free hit. We've already fought one of these guys before. Lots of experience.
[9707.13s -> 9762.49s]  I forgot about that one. Get over there and hit his hands, please. Gotta be on his left.
[9782.66s -> 9825.34s]  Hands down. Come on. Thank you. Yes. He has a hundred trillion health. I know his legs can break.
[9825.98s -> 9846.18s]  Did I try that already? He actually hit me with it. Are you full of shit? Are you full of shit or
[9846.18s -> 9864.52s]  what? You throw me off my game. I'm just going to fight him the way I know how to fight him.
[9864.52s -> 9899.64s]  All right. Now he's dead. No, I want an item. I wanted the item. What did he drop?
[9901.03s -> 9927.16s]  Oh my fucking God. What did he have? He just, you just get the axe. Really? That's it?
[9927.16s -> 9934.33s]  I swear those guys have a chance to drop something better. Their helmet or something.
[9934.33s -> 9946.49s]  Like their armor. No, don't even say it. Don't tell me. Cause now I'm like realizing like,
[9947.21s -> 9950.87s]  that doesn't make any sense. How would I wear that? It would be huge.
[9964.44s -> 9990.74s]  I want a bonfire before I go over there. Ooh, there isn't one. Really?
[10010.47s -> 10016.92s]  That looked like you could land on that. That looked not that far away.
[10017.64s -> 10034.31s]  And he's like, go all, get straight down. You and I just died at the exact same time.
[10034.31s -> 10040.84s]  Was that the same place? That would be funny. Okay. Well, I'm going to go fight this thing,
[10040.84s -> 10054.55s]  whatever it is. You can drop a crystal. What was it? You can drop rainbow stone to see if you'll die
[10054.55s -> 10063.50s]  from a drop. I can't believe I didn't know that. That's such amazing info. I can drop a stone off
[10063.50s -> 10072.01s]  and if the stone shatters, then I die. What? Okay. Well, thanks for the tip.
[10072.89s -> 10086.81s]  VR Josh tried to share this info before. Fuck. All right. Let's go fight this guy up here.
[10086.81s -> 10094.36s]  I should be able to do it. Let's go. You tell me there's not another bonfire like right here
[10094.36s -> 10109.56s]  or somewhere sitting right here. Not a bonfire. Has to be one. Has to be. Right? Maybe not.
[10120.33s -> 10128.84s]  Ah, okay. I didn't, what? I didn't see it. How did I not see it? I walked right over here.
[10130.78s -> 10140.62s]  All right. Tree sentinel version two. Let's go. Draconic tree sentinel actually is.
[10141.34s -> 10226.52s]  We got new moves. I'll be foolish. It's not hard. My God. Can I outrun it? If I just keep
[10226.52s -> 10242.06s]  running in a direction. Oh, it feels good when you get the fucking fully charged one. Do it again.
[10242.94s -> 10301.45s]  Oh, fuck. All right. Run, run, run. Holy fucking moly. That does a lot of damage.
[10305.34s -> 10344.36s]  Run, run. Oh, come on. I figured maybe I tried off the horse, but it's way harder off the horse.
[10344.92s -> 10363.19s]  It's not that bad. I got it done. I love how colorful the game is. The game is beautiful.
[10364.07s -> 10382.86s]  Eternal darkness. Does that do anything? Well, that catches his crazy beam thing.
[10383.50s -> 10395.05s]  I have one. Thank God for getting it out of the way. We're going with the other strat.
[10395.69s -> 10453.99s]  All the kill him strat. Take them all down. I didn't get away. Why make that a confirmation?
[10454.95s -> 10460.15s]  Okay. From software. Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully from software. Very carefully.
[10461.43s -> 10467.75s]  If I am going to select, if I'm going to select that item and hit and hit X,
[10469.98s -> 10472.94s]  why are you giving me a confirmation where I have to press it on the button to do it?
[10473.66s -> 10486.25s]  Why? Why? I have to select it on my inventory menu. Why can I not just do it? Why do I have
[10486.25s -> 10528.92s]  to confirm that I want to do it and hit left on the fucking D pad? It's the guy from The Simpsons.
[10530.25s -> 10583.24s]  Who's the professor from The Simpsons? Come on, quick. Fucking, it's so huge.
[10584.04s -> 10618.55s]  Fuck you, dude. It's too big. That splash damage is fucking outrageous. Three times in a row.
[10619.51s -> 10656.97s]  The fucking same boulder. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. I'm not ready to die. I'm not ready to die.
[10656.97s -> 10662.81s]  I've walked into the same boulder three fucking times. I've ran into that fucking boulder.
[10663.45s -> 10666.41s]  Come on. I'm not ready to die. I'm not ready to die yet.
[10681.72s -> 10711.53s]  Oh, he lost his magical juice. All right. I got to kill him. No. You cannot run it. You cannot run
[10711.53s -> 10767.98s]  it. I was frozen in fear. Use magic. It takes so long to cast. I'm off my horse. I could have
[10767.98s -> 10771.50s]  like switched to the thing, but like I was so afraid to cast because I thought he was going
[10771.50s -> 10779.48s]  to do that move where he fucking shoots the lighting at me. Why do I have it? All right.
[10781.38s -> 10789.18s]  This is, this is an, okay, listen. This is an int scaling weapon. I'm doing int and dex.
[10789.74s -> 10798.23s]  You understand? You understand? This is, this is, this weapon. People, okay, people think that I'm
[10798.23s -> 10823.38s]  just like swinging with no stats. I'll get it. I'll get it. I just frozen fucking fear
[10824.63s -> 10830.63s]  and hitting, holding Y and pressing R1 and then cycling through my spells to cast and stand still
[10830.63s -> 10835.03s]  for two seconds. It's not something I was prepared to do. Falling off the horse with no flasks and
[10835.03s -> 10880.01s]  he's got the lightning shit. Okay. I wasn't prepared for it. Okay. You actually can't get
[10880.01s -> 10893.46s]  away from that. You have to go forward. You might have to go forward. I wonder maybe to run forward.
[10901.51s -> 10909.02s]  Act. Nope. How do you get away from that? Do I just have to fight him off the horse in this phase?
[10911.40s -> 10917.24s]  Probably what I have to do. Cause that's like almost seems bad to be on the horse.
[10925.83s -> 10940.50s]  Can you jump? I don't know. They come from the sky. Just jump off the horse when it happens
[10940.50s -> 10963.14s]  and jump back on. That's going to get me killed though. That's right. Really? That took so fucking
[10963.14s -> 10976.02s]  long. Horse has eye frames. Getting back on the horse. Yeah. I'll get off the horse and get on
[10976.02s -> 10984.63s]  the horse when he casts it. Right? I feel like I'm, I'm doing the horse dash right when it happens
[10984.63s -> 10990.07s]  and it still hits me. Like the horse dash only lasts as long to dodge like the first two because
[10990.07s -> 10998.87s]  he goes like one, two, three, four, getting off. Yeah. I'll get off and get on. See if that works.
[10999.59s -> 11089.06s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, this is, I have, did I do it? I think it worked. No shit. It's just
[11089.06s -> 11096.30s]  so hard to be able to, that's weird though. It's hard to cycle through that much. It's hard to know
[11096.30s -> 11127.88s]  when he's going to do it. Okay. Here we go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do the thing. Wait,
[11127.88s -> 11133.38s]  there was no eye frame. What? When did the, when did the eye frame start? When did the eye frame
[11133.38s -> 11155.83s]  start? Do you honestly think I don't know the horse has a dodge 65 hours into the game? You've
[11155.83s -> 11174.52s]  seen me do it like a hundred times. You can't dodge them all. He's turning. Oh shit. He's turning.
[11174.52s -> 11193.38s]  He just growled at us. He just turned and growled. Okay. I need to get my bearings.
[11194.66s -> 11228.10s]  Okay. We're good. Okay. Okay. I'm going to beat him. I can't laugh too hard. Of course I know
[11228.10s -> 11236.26s]  the horse has a dodge. I've, I've pressed it probably 5,000 times in the course of the last
[11236.26s -> 11289.29s]  two weeks. I'm going to die. So that was really funny. I would like to continue to play the game.
[11289.93s -> 11299.94s]  That would be swell. Why would it just do this? This fucking guy can't even hurt me.
[11301.16s -> 11305.00s]  What's happening? Why am I, why can I kill him like this? He didn't hit me once.
[11305.96s -> 11362.66s]  All right. Look dodge. He's full of blood. Yeah. Cause I'm laughing my ass off. Don't listen to
[11362.66s -> 11375.66s]  what anybody on the internet says. Just stay at his butt and you won't get hit once. Just literally
[11375.66s -> 11409.19s]  don't, you know, just stay up with, just stay up his ass the whole game. It's so finicky. Do you see
[11409.19s -> 11418.74s]  how finicky it is? From software. I wonder from software. What I want to do is from software. Do
[11418.74s -> 11510.42s]  I want to get on the horse? That's fun. What do you say? And I said, please for the love of God.
[11511.14s -> 11533.32s]  Please for the love of God use glintstone pebbles. They've been an upbeat dragon that
[11533.32s -> 11560.26s]  lands on this bridge from everyone. You growled at us. I need to see it. I have to see it. I need
[11560.26s -> 11576.33s]  to see it. Is this it? Hold on. We need to watch this. I need to examine this. Cause I, I don't
[11576.33s -> 11592.41s]  know what the fuck. I don't know what the fuck happened. Oh my fucking God. I look like a weirdo.
[11593.21s -> 11600.33s]  Oh my God, dude.
[11605.64s -> 11614.79s]  What? Why does it sound so weird? What is it sound so weird? What's wrong with this?
[11615.77s -> 11618.01s]  Why do I sound like a, is that what I sound like?
[11624.41s -> 11638.52s]  Why do I sound like a fucking cave troll? Oh, it haven't. It doesn't sound much better.
[11643.51s -> 11648.23s]  He's like, he's turning. Oh shit. He's turning. He just growled at us.
[11651.93s -> 11676.68s]  Oh my fucking God, dude. Somebody said Tim the tool man. But honestly, man, when somebody asks
[11676.68s -> 11681.56s]  you, when somebody says, Hey dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game? It's like, bro.
[11683.72s -> 11714.02s]  Yes. Fundamental part of the whole game. Oh, all right. That was, that was very funny.
[11714.66s -> 11724.87s]  That was a very fun time. Let's take a second here. Let's take a second and relax. That was
[11724.87s -> 11737.29s]  very fun. That's so fucking funny though. You know, it's funny. Like you pick up, let me give
[11737.29s -> 11746.86s]  you some, let me, here's some streamer insight. Okay. When the streamers mad, like very mad and
[11746.86s -> 11753.42s]  the streamer looks over and sees just picks out the one comment. That's just like, Hey yo, bro.
[11753.42s -> 11759.90s]  Like maybe you should go back to fucking Mario tennis. It's just like, Oh, you fucker. You
[11759.90s -> 11765.26s]  motherfucker. Don't say that to me right now. I'm in the middle. I'm getting my ass kicked.
[11765.98s -> 11793.00s]  You're the only person that does that. No, no way. That was fucking wild. Okay. That was fun.
[11793.00s -> 11799.32s]  I'm glad you all enjoyed that. That was a good time. I want to see what's in this room.
[11799.48s -> 11837.82s]  35 Vigor. I'm not the most unhinged Elden Ring streamer, right? Like I'm not. I can't be.
[11837.82s -> 11844.33s]  There's like, there's thousands of streamers that are like crazy, right? I'm not crazy. I'm,
[11844.33s -> 11852.54s]  it can't, I can't be the craziest guy. Everybody growls at their audience, right? And then like
[11852.54s -> 11858.62s]  it turns purple and I turned, I turned purple. Has any streamer played Elden Ring and turns purple?
[11859.10s -> 11870.47s]  Uh, maybe I should stop playing. Maybe I should stop playing Elden Ring. Like yo dude, um,
[11870.47s -> 11875.91s]  that's probably not healthy to turn like a dark purple while you're sitting in your chair.
[11876.71s -> 11889.35s]  You know, they probably got, you're probably right. All right. I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[11889.83s -> 11914.49s]  Okay. You're turning into Grimace. So was there anything else in this room? I'm in the castle
[11915.05s -> 11924.81s]  now, which is cool, bro. Oh, my stomach hurts from laughing. I can't believe I actually growled at
[11924.81s -> 11936.25s]  you. I like, I like growled at you. That was like animalistic. Like what was that? Oh my God.
[11936.89s -> 11959.02s]  What a fucking weirdo. You growled at like 10 to 12,000 people. Sky Live? I kind of feel,
[11959.02s -> 11969.46s]  I feel bad for doing that. How come you're so shiny? Dude, if that's your, if that's your
[11969.46s -> 11974.82s]  actual question, if that's your question as to why I'm shiny, maybe it's the beads of sweat
[11974.82s -> 11980.39s]  going down the crack of my ass right now. It could have something to do with that.
[11984.66s -> 11999.24s]  I'm sure it has something to do with it. Another bonfire. All right. We haven't heard from her in
[11999.24s -> 12020.18s]  a while. This is the base of the Erd Tree. Wait, so we had to bring her to the tree?
[12026.87s -> 12032.68s]  Why couldn't she just walk here? Why couldn't you just come here? Isn't this,
[12032.68s -> 12055.45s]  I'm about to be maidenless. Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks for, thanks for everything. I want to read
[12055.45s -> 12066.87s]  this. Okay. Equipment load. What's the utilization on this? Rank that to get temp equipment load.
[12066.87s -> 12076.92s]  Why would you, it seems weird. Rank that and then put on a great axe or something. Briefly stop
[12076.92s -> 12090.23s]  rune loss on death. What? Really? That seems insane. So if you know you're going to die,
[12090.23s -> 12100.81s]  you just chug that and you don't lose your souls. That's like an oh shit button. I wonder how long
[12100.81s -> 12119.53s]  it lasts. Enhanced charged attacks for a time. That's pretty good. It's 10 seconds. I wonder what
[12119.53s -> 12127.62s]  it would pair with because you don't want to, you really want to do it with, that's like the,
[12127.62s -> 12153.00s]  I'm going to die button. I don't know. Maybe just the heal, just in case. It's three minutes. Well,
[12153.00s -> 12157.90s]  that changes everything. Okay. So why would, yeah, just drink that right before you get into a boss
[12157.90s -> 12172.73s]  room. Yeah. I'm going to keep it like this. Very cool. So she's like, oh, I'm going to leave you
[12172.73s -> 12184.81s]  now. Cause now we're at the base of the urn tree. She's over here. Lynn, Lindell, royal capital.
[12184.81s -> 12236.86s]  All right. This is cool. Very cool. It's kind of creepy. These guys are terrible. I mean,
[12236.86s -> 12246.78s]  you're really cool looking. They're actually, I like these enemies a lot, but what the fuck are
[12246.78s -> 12281.19s]  you doing, man? They like crabs, white flesh. Whoa. Oh my God. Good move for here. Good move
[12281.19s -> 12300.12s]  for here. Yeah. Oh, check the ax out. Yeah. Where is it? Gargoyle's great ax. No, where is it?
[12302.25s -> 12318.86s]  Dragon claw, dragon, great claw. Like a turkey bone. Wreath with lightning. Can I check it out?
[12319.50s -> 12341.86s]  It's not faith weapon. It's just a strength weapon. That's pretty cool. Oh, I got a shield too.
[12341.86s -> 12356.12s]  You're right. Dragon. This is a lightning shield imbued with lightning. Damn. Very cool.
[12357.88s -> 12388.01s]  Exceptionally cool. I don't know what that thing is, but I'm not going close to this guy.
[12397.74s -> 12413.03s]  I have a lot of runes. Maybe when you growled at us. I remember, trust me, I love inside of here.
[12413.67s -> 12429.13s]  7k is not a lot. No, I mean these are what I'm talking about. I have quite a few of those.
[12429.77s -> 12457.11s]  I want to check this out. Invoiced horn. You can actually use one of these horns?
[12461.14s -> 12472.54s]  Is this sorcery? No, it's a faith weapon. Oh, you can blow the bubbles too. That's so awesome.
[12473.10s -> 12490.62s]  It doesn't work. No, stop. You're getting spit all in it. No, you're doing it wrong.
[12491.58s -> 12537.75s]  Give me back. Take over here. Yeah. Really? Don't do it. Don't do it. Please don't do it.
[12537.75s -> 12565.83s]  I am begging you. Don't do it. I'm trying. I'm just trying. What's the chest piece? This chest
[12565.83s -> 12575.94s]  piece is the mausoleum knight armor. It's pretty cool. It's pretty good. Been very good so far.
[12585.85s -> 12592.52s]  I do love these internal areas though. They're awesome. Very pretty. Very cool. I like the kind
[12592.52s -> 12603.13s]  of overgrowth. Looks interesting. All right, so that wrapped all the way around. I guess we're
[12603.13s -> 12644.55s]  just going to go that way. The growl. The growl incident. It went that way. There we go. Okay.
[12645.66s -> 12674.20s]  I'm going to say let's go this way first. Somebody's behind me. Did you block that too?
[12683.98s -> 12708.89s]  Yeah, that was greedy. Where's the nearest bonfire? Right here. Okay.
[12708.89s -> 12753.21s]  Are you going to do nintendogs? I do like the flail. It's starting to show that it's very good.
[12753.21s -> 12777.22s]  I'm going to get it to plus 10. You bet your ass. There's a lever. The weapon art is amazing.
[12780.22s -> 12796.71s]  All right, let's try that again. What? Is there something in the front door? These guys are alive
[12796.71s -> 12837.35s]  so let's change that. Okay, remind me that there's a ladder in this room, please.
[12837.35s -> 12874.49s]  Hmm. I like this area a lot. Let me just check and see what's up here.
[12874.49s -> 12888.95s]  Ooh, that was a pretty good hiding spot for this. Fume bottle. I have like two or three of these.
[12888.95s -> 12896.25s]  This place looks like a dream for people that like to jump around and parkour in random places.
[12897.85s -> 12937.30s]  I can already see a dozen different ways to go. I'm going to get a bubble on them. All right,
[12937.30s -> 12940.02s]  I'll get my souls. I'm just going to. There might be something right here.
[12952.38s -> 12970.30s]  Shit. Is the ladder in that room? I just went up it. Make me growl. Don't make me growl again.
[12972.23s -> 12984.14s]  Upper class robe. Right green robe worn by noble children.
[12984.14s -> 12988.54s]  Donning such a robe is traditionally the child's first show of burgeoning independence.
[12990.26s -> 13008.63s]  There's a lot of magic details. Why does this fit? I feel like that shouldn't fit.
[13010.49s -> 13018.14s]  Ooh, wait a minute. Okay, what's this? Ah, that's this is where I was.
[13018.14s -> 13028.09s]  This is where I fought that guy. Down here. Down there. Okay, let's not make the same mistake twice.
[13028.89s -> 13054.63s]  Good opener. Oh, what an opener. So fucking good. Who cares about Katana who? Katana who, huh?
[13055.35s -> 13077.77s]  Katana who? So what's in here? It's not a door. That looks like a door.
[13081.14s -> 13105.59s]  Jesus. Don't get greedy. Look at this space. What the fuck am I doing?
[13108.94s -> 13113.58s]  What's the range? What's the range, man? How far can I do that?
[13118.39s -> 13130.18s]  He was far. I thought he couldn't go that far with that old bullshit. It's just wherever you are.
[13130.18s -> 13134.46s]  All right. Well, let me get back out there. God damn it's a far run.
[13135.66s -> 13160.87s]  Like I'm close to a bonfire there. How late am I going? Uh, probably another hour.
[13160.87s -> 13163.91s]  And you just distracted me, which is going to cost me all my souls.
[13164.63s -> 13171.30s]  I want that person timed out. Yep. I'm fucking screamer again.
[13171.30s -> 13192.74s]  I can just jump into there. All right. I just jump. Is it safe for me just to jump to this
[13192.74s -> 13238.28s]  and fall? I don't have to wait for the elevator. Stop fucking this up. Beautiful. Okay. There's
[13238.28s -> 13247.03s]  nothing else over here. There's a guy right here. Wondering why I killed that guy in case I have to
[13247.03s -> 13300.65s]  kite this guy out. I don't want to bump into that guy. Oh shit. Damn. Damn. What the fuck?
[13300.65s -> 13313.78s]  Hey, those guys are horrible. Those guys are nuts. Why do people keep saying better gamer
[13313.78s -> 13318.36s]  chair? What's that mean? Better gamer chair, better gamer chair. Why are you saying that?
[13325.40s -> 13395.86s]  What does it mean? Where is this? This is down in this weird lobby. It's, it's he kills me or I
[13395.86s -> 13404.66s]  kill him. Sorry guys. I know it was a beautiful flute song, but the beautiful flute song turns
[13404.66s -> 13409.78s]  into a little fucking like shoe knife that he's like and sticks it in my neck.
[13417.62s -> 13421.64s]  Not these guys breaking through the wall. Somebody come through the wall.
[13422.52s -> 13464.17s]  2500 damage. What burst burst damage. Damn man. How much somebody else alive down here?
[13464.17s -> 13477.56s]  Where are they? Yep. So what do you got? What do you hide in here? What's in here?
[13477.56s -> 13504.49s]  Forming stone and ruin or the down. There's a, okay. There's a night standing there.
[13505.13s -> 13513.59s]  How many little corridors to go in? I don't know which one is the right one. There's somebody to do.
[13514.47s -> 13531.26s]  I killed him already. There's so much cool shit over here. Wait, this is just back out here.
[13531.82s -> 13540.97s]  Remember, did you eat? I took a 20 minute, 25 minute break or so in the middle of this stream
[13540.97s -> 13564.60s]  and I had food. I ate and it was good. I'm good to go till the end of the stream. All right. This
[13564.60s -> 13571.32s]  guy's going to be a pain in the ass. Does he see me already or no? Can I get behind him?
[13584.60s -> 13616.74s]  Is it open from this side? What? Oh well. All right. We're going right down main street here.
[13616.74s -> 13626.55s]  I don't like this without a bonfire. I don't like this without some kind of bonfire to get to.
[13627.19s -> 13637.02s]  That one's going to jump down here. Dude, I don't, I don't like this. I need a bonfire.
[13637.02s -> 13667.86s]  I'm going back this way. Come on right here. Is this a shortcut? Wait, this is the front door.
[13668.58s -> 13697.74s]  I think this is the front door to get in. No, it's not. Why the fuck would I think that? Is
[13697.74s -> 13706.33s]  there a bonfire? I just need a bonfire. That's all I need. Turn around, turn around, turn around,
[13706.33s -> 13723.94s]  turn around. I will. I will. I'll turn around. Don't worry. I thought that was a tank. I was
[13723.94s -> 13731.90s]  like, why is that? This is weird. Why would there be a like a like world war two tank? That was
[13731.90s -> 13741.59s]  kind of weird looking. All right. So this is, this is not the right way then. But,
[13744.42s -> 13751.94s]  uh, so I got to go this way, but there's no bonfire. This, this dragon is going to come
[13751.94s -> 13756.18s]  to life. It's going to break out of the stone and jump down and have two twin blades. And it's going
[13756.18s -> 13762.34s]  to be awful. I could try going this way, which is, that's precisely what I'm going to do.
[13762.98s -> 13850.30s]  I'm going to go the other way. This goes up, goes down. Uh, um, okay. Oh, can't make that jump.
[13855.59s -> 13881.34s]  Fuck. There's a guy up there. I am begging you. I don't know. Uh, I don't know what you're begging
[13881.34s -> 13924.38s]  me. I missed it. I didn't see what you said. Begging you. Ooh, nice. What's that? What's that?
[13924.38s -> 13938.04s]  Okay. Nothing. Nothing to be concerned with. That linger is such a long time too. That move is so
[13938.04s -> 13977.30s]  goddamn good. All right. I can go down. I think this is the boss. Uh, no, no, no, I'm not ready.
[13977.30s -> 13981.24s]  I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not
[13981.24s -> 13991.88s]  ready. Come here. In here. In here. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Oh shit. There's one of these guys.
[13995.54s -> 14008.38s]  Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Don't do it. You fuck. The timings. I just was, he, I did not expect him
[14008.38s -> 14015.11s]  to be in this room. He goes bang, bang, bang, bang. I didn't think he's going to do more than twice
[14015.11s -> 14027.02s]  or three times. He did four times in a row. I have no idea where the fuck that is. Good luck finding
[14027.02s -> 14035.69s]  that shit. It's in this labyrinth down here. Uh, I think I just jumped on the roof.
[14037.86s -> 14102.18s]  We begged you. Uh, what are you begging me? Please. Oh, did you do that? Fine. Fine. Fine.
[14102.18s -> 14125.66s]  Fuck you. What is it? What? What is that? What? He was going to just keep, he was going to chase
[14125.66s -> 14144.62s]  me through the whole goddamn labyrinth and I, I just, just, I did, I stopped running because
[14144.62s -> 14148.94s]  it was like this guy's not going to stop. He has a lightning move that if he has line of sight,
[14148.94s -> 14153.90s]  he can just ping me with it if my back is turned and I'm going to get hit by it and I'm just going
[14153.90s -> 14165.00s]  to be fucking infuriating. And then we got this random dickhead over here. Is this death? No.
[14165.00s -> 14214.60s]  Okay. That's how you do it. Stop. Okay. So now where am I at now? There's more shit over here.
[14214.60s -> 14225.21s]  Okay. This is that kind of just main road. I went over there. That guy scared the shit out of me.
[14225.21s -> 14229.30s]  I'm going to go back over there and I'm going to fight him after I get these items.
[14229.94s -> 14268.98s]  These are worth getting, man. This is like 10, 20,000 ruins each. Each. Easy. A thousand
[14268.98s -> 14283.78s]  damage almost fully charged. All right. So that's that way. I'm going to just gently drop down here.
[14283.78s -> 14291.27s]  Just check over here. Yeah, of course. There could be something down here. There is. There's a
[14291.27s -> 14347.34s]  mushroom. What's up, boys? No, no, no lightning. Thank God. He's stuck in the tree. What the fuck,
[14347.34s -> 14390.42s]  dude? Wow. Are you a leaf? Killed that guy already. I'm just making sure, you know,
[14390.42s -> 14402.58s]  lose your area. Well, I should have drank this thing. I keep forgetting. I have it.
[14411.59s -> 14447.14s]  Imped faith is too faith for putting it on. That's pretty cool. All right. Now let me go
[14448.57s -> 14461.46s]  to where that scary night was. He was down here. Okay. All right. Here we go. Let's see if I can
[14461.46s -> 14554.49s]  beat him. Can't backstab him. Holy shit. Damn you. Damn you pile of a damn that. Wait, did I do a
[14554.49s -> 14574.18s]  Stewie? Heroes rune five. That was fucking nuts. Okay. I have enough to level up probably three or
[14574.18s -> 14597.53s]  four times. Is there anything else down here? What's this? Still going? Uh, yeah. I'm in it
[14597.53s -> 14611.94s]  for a little while longer. Or cut please. Oh my God. There's a door here. Oh wow. Thank goodness.
[14611.94s -> 14622.26s]  Just like the old days of dark souls. A skip that goes across the whole thing. Thank God. All right.
[14622.26s -> 14635.74s]  It's time to do some, uh, rune smashing. Abundance of runes. 35,000 souls. Damn.
[14636.30s -> 14651.83s]  We're going to be a level up probably twice. I need like a hundred and something thousand to
[14651.83s -> 14674.86s]  level up two times. That should do it. What do we need? Okay. Uh, I think the play is just to get to,
[14678.94s -> 14700.36s]  I think it's just to get to 40 vigor, get to the soft cap and a couple into endurance. I think. Uh,
[14700.84s -> 14722.09s]  okay. I'll just kill a few things. The off cap is 60. It is. I thought it was 40, 50 something
[14722.09s -> 14761.08s]  thousand. Remember it is. Come here. Stop moving around so much. 51, four, seven, eight. I got
[14761.08s -> 14781.34s]  enough. Let's go. Thank God I got that door. I didn't even know that existed either. Okay. Let's go
[14782.46s -> 14791.10s]  37 vigor. I want to get this to 40 and then I'll cap it. 50 intelligence.
[14791.66s -> 14806.10s]  What does soft cap mean? Soft cap means that for every point you put it into,
[14806.10s -> 14811.38s]  into it after the soft cap, you get less than you normally did all the way through 40 to 60,
[14811.38s -> 14819.38s]  whatever it is. So the soft cap is 60. That means after 60 at 61, you're getting a reduced amount
[14820.10s -> 14830.90s]  per point you put in. So they always tell you, you know, guides, Reddit, gamers,
[14831.70s -> 14835.22s]  is to try to get to the soft cap and then get something else up and then,
[14835.94s -> 14844.52s]  you know, pound out something past the soft cap into the hard cap or gaps in 99. Right. All right.
[14844.52s -> 14860.01s]  I'm going straight down here. I want to fight that oratory avatar. It's right here. It just appears
[14860.01s -> 14959.10s]  out of nowhere. Oh, my souls. Oh, magic Mario Odyssey build. What used to gain an enormous
[14959.10s -> 14970.86s]  abundance of ruins. Is that a hundred thousand? It's probably 50. Oh yeah. 50 K right there.
[14970.86s -> 14999.22s]  Hell yeah. I want that item. I'm still, I don't think I don't see you over there.
[15005.67s -> 15012.49s]  All right. Okay. What happened here? Spitting stone and then I want to get this.
[15016.65s -> 15031.08s]  Holy grease. Please do your best Mario Yahoo. Now I've been streaming for 10 hours, man. I'm,
[15031.16s -> 15038.76s]  I ain't going to get a Yahoo out of me right now. I'm sorry. I haven't had my chapstick.
[15038.76s -> 15060.92s]  I've been licking my lips all day. Would you please make a sound effect
[15061.56s -> 15098.09s]  so we know that you're all right? Yeah. Oh, all right. Don't be greedy here. Just
[15098.09s -> 15103.77s]  I can grab it and run, grab it and run, grab it and run. In fact, why not use sorcery?
[15148.89s -> 15152.57s]  Ones of ruins here. They really want you to level up. Don't they? Holy shit.
[15152.57s -> 15166.14s]  Can you run here from the beginning of the game? Can you, can you just get here? Sort of. What if
[15166.14s -> 15170.46s]  you just ran around and just didn't fight anything and just picked up like 300,000 souls worth of
[15170.46s -> 15177.13s]  ruins and then leveled up like 30 times and just wet the floor with the whole game. Oh, you have to
[15177.13s -> 15186.82s]  beat the horse guy. Yeah. Nevermind. That's not going to happen. That's true. All right. Was that
[15186.82s -> 15212.54s]  all that was up here? Yes, it was. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
[15212.54s -> 15221.05s]  Where am I? What happened? Where'd I go? Where did I just go? I went back to like the beginning.
[15223.06s -> 15273.64s]  Oh, don't do it. Oh, oh. Oh, he de-aggroed. Hell yeah. Fuck you. That's a bad, that's bad.
[15273.64s -> 15341.45s]  That's very bad. Let me get it off. Oh, stop it. Ah, somebody's shooting a bow and arrow like a dick.
[15341.45s -> 15381.43s]  Look at you in there. You're so fucking good. Weasley coward. I see. All right. We're doing
[15381.43s -> 15436.89s]  like the sewer. Kick the ladder down. Oh, dear God. Uh, fuck it. Still hurts. Wasn't as scary as he
[15436.89s -> 15450.71s]  looked. Omen smirk mask? What was that? Whoa. Mask with long hideously twisted horns worn by the
[15450.71s -> 15473.14s]  Omen killers increases strength. That is pretty ugly. I don't need strength. All right. So what
[15473.14s -> 15485.62s]  was that for? Oh, nice. All right. I can level up again. Lionel's helm. Lionel's armor.
[15486.42s -> 15506.71s]  Who's Lionel? Death bed dress. Who's Lionel? Worn by Lionel the Lionhearted. Wait, he was part,
[15506.71s -> 15536.73s]  he was at the Redan fight. But heavy load. Still heavy. I don't think I can, I don't have enough
[15536.73s -> 15552.36s]  endurance to put any of this on. It's cool though. I could put the gloves on. Sure, why not? I cannot
[15552.36s -> 15570.79s]  put the gloves on. Never mind. Too heavy. Still fat rolling. What? What did I put on? Oh, it was
[15570.79s -> 15586.06s]  the Godric soldier grooves. Okay, there we go. Did you go to sleep? Uh, I have a feeling there's
[15586.06s -> 15590.22s]  probably something right down here. I'll give it a 10th or two and then we'll probably call it.
[15590.22s -> 15610.94s]  Let's crush this. Damn. So many. I'm telling you a figure to 40. I think I can get there.
[15611.58s -> 15629.62s]  Let's be 20, 30, 30,000. Almost there. All right. Whatever. Okay. I rested here. That was pretty
[15629.62s -> 15649.99s]  cool. Sewer. This guy's back. He's just a regular enemy. He's not scary. You're done. Dude, you're
[15649.99s -> 15660.84s]  put on the dress. Um, I could look at it. I didn't even see what it did. That was a missed click.
[15661.64s -> 15666.52s]  Are you in here? Really? Get out of here. You couldn't even fit through the fucking door.
[15667.56s -> 15725.30s]  Don't even aggro him. Just go. What are you hiding in here? I think you just cashed out
[15725.30s -> 15743.74s]  all the ruins. I know it was stupid. Okay, here we go. Whatever it is. Wait, we're already, we're
[15743.82s -> 15797.18s]  Oh, it's this thing. It's this thing. Right. Okay. Let's go. This is the rot one. Oh,
[15798.30s -> 15862.62s]  oh, he's in the fucking wall. No, that's a different move. Oh, he got me. He got me in his mouth.
[15862.62s -> 15927.66s]  No, survive it. Survive it. Prove me wrong. Jesus. Fuck you with this weird bendy neck.
[15946.26s -> 15986.26s]  Hey, yes. Okay. Golden seed. That boss looks like beyond meat. Did you say that or did he make that
[15986.26s -> 15998.02s]  up? Somebody actually say that? All right. So he dropped a golden seed. They're just throwing.
[15998.02s -> 16005.94s]  This is just like the boss. Enemies are enemies that are regular enemies here. What's that?
[16005.94s -> 16020.01s]  Pulsarated worm. Yeah. I have fought that thing a couple of times before. All right. So that's all
[16020.01s -> 16046.01s]  that's over here. Listen, missing something, right? Anything else that he was guarding? Well,
[16046.01s -> 16070.70s]  I'm going to level up. Put the dress on. What do you want? Where is it? Slowly replenishes
[16070.70s -> 16101.66s]  the HP of nearby allies. It heals. That's pretty cool. All right. Now, now where? Can't level up
[16101.66s -> 16117.72s]  yet. Should I keep going down the street? Go down the main street. Okay. Uh, where the hell was that?
[16117.72s -> 16142.10s]  I went down to the sewer. My Lord. Not over fucking here. How did I get there? What's this?
[16143.06s -> 16157.78s]  Oh, right. There's a bonfire. Let me just go sit at the bonfire and then come out and walk down the
[16157.78s -> 16164.65s]  street. Do you feel okay? I feel all right. I'm definitely, it's definitely getting close to,
[16164.65s -> 16174.01s]  I'm probably going to call it soon here. It looks so red. Yeah, I know. Let me just go back.
[16174.89s -> 16186.95s]  Why am I running? Do I have aggro? Why do I have aggro? Okay. So what bonfire is the best one?
[16187.77s -> 16205.34s]  This one here. Yeah, I'm, I'm very red, very sweaty, a little tired and a half hours. That's not,
[16205.34s -> 16215.19s]  it's not too, I mean, that's long. Okay. I'm going to go right down the main street.
[16216.23s -> 16219.03s]  I would imagine that within the next 20 minutes, we're probably going to stop.
[16221.74s -> 16229.13s]  Look dead. Yeah, I'll stop soon. Don't worry. I'm fine. Trust me. I'm fine. I would tell you if I
[16229.13s -> 16245.53s]  wasn't, it's just an intense gamer session. Plus I have a light here. This is like an orange light.
[16245.53s -> 16252.26s]  So it's making me look a little more red. Okay. So you're saying go all the way down here,
[16252.82s -> 16271.70s]  straight through into the store. Yeah, I remember this. Okay. See what we can do. I can go in there.
[16272.74s -> 16288.52s]  Wait, I was going to say, is that a bonfire? It is. This would be handy if I knew what this was.
[16289.24s -> 16322.74s]  So is there something down here? It's a dick move. Oh, that's a dick move. And they got a guy back
[16322.74s -> 16341.74s]  there shooting arrows. Of course they do. Both of you. I don't care. Ash of War Thunderbolt.
[16342.38s -> 16365.56s]  Okay, this is a new place. This is a new zone almost. Is he looking this way? I think he is.
[16365.56s -> 16384.23s]  Yeah, he's not. Get the items. And if there's anything else down here, I'll take it.
[16384.95s -> 16412.57s]  Oh my. Whoops. All right, we're going down here. All right, I'm almost close to a level.
[16418.63s -> 16445.02s]  And daggers. Birdsteel dagger. That's new. What does this go into? Broken colossal weapon damage
[16445.02s -> 16466.15s]  on that? Oh, I just snuck behind everything. Whoa. Whoa. Jesus. I guess I'm going to do this.
[16476.62s -> 16499.14s]  This is massive material. Gravelstone? Somebody's shooting at me and I know from where
[16508.17s -> 16535.72s]  I make that. I can land here. Yeah. Lunark. Shit. Okay. Okay. Be careful. I don't want to lose.
[16536.73s -> 16548.42s]  I don't want to lose these, so I'm going to drink this. Take them off the edge.
[16549.14s -> 16587.78s]  Gravelstone? Lindell Knight armor. Wow. Jeez. Whoa. This place is massive. This is huge. Wow.
[16589.22s -> 16598.74s]  I'll take that. I can go down that way. But let's take it. All right. There's another bonfire.
[16599.30s -> 16614.49s]  Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. I need to literally sneeze on one thing. Do I have any?
[16615.21s -> 16629.27s]  I don't want to use that. All right. Well, that guy's scary, so we're going to go over here first.
[16630.23s -> 16647.77s]  Cane sword. Love sword of an aged knight whose last quest was long behind him.
[16648.41s -> 16671.46s]  Repurposed into a walking stick. Cool. Looks like... I'm curious. How does it swing? It looks like a
[16671.46s -> 16687.48s]  Minecraft sword. This looks like it wouldn't hurt very much. Like a fire poker. This doesn't really
[16687.48s -> 16705.10s]  look that dangerous. It's cool though. All right. This looks interesting. Whatever it is. Okay. This
[16705.10s -> 16714.97s]  is actually perfect. I'm going to level up. I'm going to see if there's a boss right here.
[16715.77s -> 16720.25s]  If there is no boss right here within 30 seconds of this bonfire, I'm going to call it.
[16720.81s -> 16749.61s]  Is this a lever? Did that open this door? Did that open the gate underneath me? Oh,
[16749.61s -> 16754.15s]  shit. That's definitely a boss. Yeah. Without a doubt. Let's go see who it is.
[16754.79s -> 16784.97s]  I'm going to level up first. Let's just see if it is. I'm going to check right now.
[16784.97s -> 16796.44s]  I'm going to hopefully don't kill me. All right. So what's down here?
[16796.92s -> 16816.62s]  Dude, this is a boss. This is a boss, dude. Who the hell am I?
[16822.07s -> 16839.74s]  Ooh. Al. Albarich's pointed hat. How do these people die? Strengthens thorn sorcery.
[16843.22s -> 16857.11s]  The robe looks awesome. Where is it? Yeah. Look at this. That looks cool. That looks cool,
[16857.11s -> 16867.42s]  but not for me. At least not right now. This is the guy from the round table,
[16867.42s -> 16875.70s]  the basement of the round table. Oh, is this the round table?
[16876.34s -> 16892.39s]  This looks like the round table. Wait, but if this is the round table, then
[16892.39s -> 16911.29s]  where the hell have we been teleporting to? Painting table of lost grace. I don't get it.
[16911.29s -> 16934.39s]  Like the hunter's dream. Interesting. It's the real one. All right. I'm out of gas.
[16934.95s -> 16945.50s]  This is a whole nother. There's a whole nother like ton of explanation.
[16947.32s -> 16952.58s]  Explanation exploration is what I meant to say, but I will get the items because they're right here.
[16954.17s -> 16962.18s]  The two fingers prayer book. I scared the shit out of myself. I heard something skittering around.
[16962.82s -> 16987.45s]  Oh yeah, this is the round table. That's cool. All right. As much as I want to keep going,
[16988.62s -> 16996.02s]  after turning purple at that upgraded tree sentinel, I think it's time to stop.
[16996.02s -> 17007.90s]  That was really cool. Is there a boss that's like right here that I can see?
[17010.90s -> 17017.06s]  Like right here? I feel like I'm really close. I just want to see it. I just want to see it.
[17022.17s -> 17069.53s]  Right here is a dog. Keep going. And this is fucking crazy. I'll explore this better next time.
[17076.78s -> 17106.38s]  All the way. How am I? Stupid. All right. I'm going to explore this later. I just want to see
[17106.38s -> 17130.28s]  the boss. There's a bonfire like right here. It probably is odd free. The first Elden Lord.
[17130.28s -> 17192.30s]  Why is he a shade? You got some fucking moves. Don't you? God. Oh my God. He's so susceptible
[17192.30s -> 17231.13s]  to that move. Wow. That's an 1100 fucking damage. Jesus Christ. I'm burning through all my shit.
[17248.10s -> 17270.90s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm going to beat him. I'm going to beat him. I'm going to beat him.
[17271.99s -> 17275.03s]  He's not, his timing's not that hard. I got it. I got it. I got it right here.
[17281.70s -> 17290.39s]  I got it. I got it. Don't worry. I got it. I got it. I'm going to get him. What? Oh, okay. Right.
[17293.16s -> 17296.20s]  All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I got it. I got it. I got it. Just dodge. That's it. Just
[17296.20s -> 17398.46s]  dodge him. Blocked it. Fuck you. I'll do it and I'll do it again. That was a mistake.
[17421.21s -> 17439.74s]  The baby rattles the best weapon in the game. 80 fucking thousand ruins. Holy shit.
[17440.70s -> 17465.66s]  Do the next boss. This one right here. Are you serious? New talisman slot, dude. Oh my God.
[17465.66s -> 17473.58s]  That's actually, this is going to take me a while to figure that out. All right. I got,
[17474.30s -> 17477.50s]  I'll just see what the, I'll just look at the boss. I'm just going to look at the boss.
[17478.14s -> 17503.34s]  I don't know what you want to do. Maybe just like the FP. I'll put it on for now. All right. So you're
[17503.34s -> 17512.65s]  saying that there's another boss on the HP one. I, I don't want to lose these ruins though.
[17512.65s -> 17528.02s]  This is a lot of ruins to lose. Do I need to level up these six? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,
[17528.02s -> 17534.76s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm almost there. Just, oh, I can use the flask. That's right. Okay.
[17535.32s -> 17540.54s]  I forgot about the flask. All right. So just wait, just check out the boss.
[17541.42s -> 17551.03s]  We rest here and you're saying there's just another one right here. This is actually it
[17551.03s -> 17553.75s]  though. Like I'm just going to literally walk in and just fight it for five seconds.
[17554.39s -> 17575.51s]  Just up the branch, up those stairs. Wait, let go up that branch. Wait, there's an item over here.
[17587.90s -> 17590.78s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. So you're saying there's a boss up here.
[17592.22s -> 17613.50s]  That's pretty crazy that this back to back boss is, where's he at? Just here. Okay. Yeah,
[17613.50s -> 17658.30s]  this definitely is boss. All right. I'm going to drink the thing. Oh, we both have the same idea.
[17666.68s -> 17691.06s]  Is that it? More? That's a pre-boss. What about my flask? Is my flask still active?
[17691.06s -> 17696.14s]  How was the, that was a pre-boss. Is it, is it actually a boss? Are you guys fucking with me?
[17696.14s -> 17712.46s]  I was thinking of the urn tree. Damn. Oh, that actually is. Okay. All right. So that was a
[17712.46s -> 17727.99s]  pre-boss. All right. Drink the flask. What's in here? This is the base of the fucking urn tree.
[17727.99s -> 17751.82s]  Is it Margit again? Margit for a third time. This is, he's like Kael'thas at this point.
[17751.82s -> 17777.19s]  All right. It clones.
[17785.02s -> 17786.87s]  We haven't seen half of these people yet.
[17792.49s -> 17808.74s]  Is my drink running out by the way in this cutscene? I hope not. Margit.
[17809.46s -> 17827.00s]  Oh, now it's actually. What's this guy's problem?
[17834.15s -> 18007.64s]  What's his name? Morgoth? No, fuck you. It's going to hurt. Oh man. Oh fuck. I thought I had it.
[18007.64s -> 18014.90s]  I'm just too tired. Oh, I'm just too tired. When we got down to like the last 40%, I just was like,
[18014.90s -> 18026.86s]  fuck man. It was like colors. Oh, damn it. Oh, if I had 11 more matcha powder in my vape.
[18028.73s -> 18042.66s]  One more try. One more try. I thought I had it too. Damn it. Oh, oh, I'm too tired.
[18044.26s -> 18073.85s]  Why can't it be like hour number three instead of hour number 11? Oh, thought I dodged it.
[18074.57s -> 18084.04s]  Oh, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. Damn. Oh, I was so close on the first try.
[18084.04s -> 18089.66s]  I almost did it. I was going to be such a fucking gamer. I was going to be such a gamer.
[18090.86s -> 18104.41s]  I was going to be best gamer moment 2022. All right. Actual final try. I promise. If I don't,
[18104.41s -> 18113.05s]  it doesn't matter. Actual final try. I promise. Use your summons. Oh, I don't have anything.
[18113.05s -> 18153.88s]  I was so close. I thought I did it. I didn't do it, mom. Sorry. All right. Let's get him. Oh,
[18153.88s -> 18193.85s]  double. Oh my God. We're kicking the shit out of him. Oh my God. Beat his ass. What the fuck? Oh
[18193.85s -> 18216.54s]  my God. Why wouldn't I do this the first time? Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Jump him. Not
[18216.54s -> 18226.52s]  yet. Not yet. Not yet. Get him. Oh my God. That was so easy. That was so easy with the summon.
[18228.36s -> 18239.34s]  What? That was so fucking simple with the summon. We just beat the shit out of him. We just comboed
[18239.34s -> 18257.40s]  him. The mimic got the last hit. What the fuck? That was so intense and so hard and so ridiculous.
[18257.40s -> 18262.12s]  I just rang a bell and a guy came and fucking kicked the shit out of him.
[18270.60s -> 18281.82s]  Okay. All right. That was really cool. Mimic is fucking unbelievable. Are you fucking kidding me?
[18282.62s -> 18295.50s]  That was insane. All right. Well, I almost beat him first try. Oh, and then I rang the bell and
[18295.50s -> 18299.70s]  somebody else came in and beat him for me. All right. That's actually the end of the fucking
[18299.70s -> 18340.98s]  scream. I'm done. That was nuts. All right. So you tried to be Elden Lord and didn't work.
[18341.78s -> 18348.74s]  Oh, he's dead. All right. So you tried to be Elden Lord. That didn't do anything.
[18349.38s -> 18356.30s]  There's another boss behind the door. Check it out. No, I don't know. I'm out of here. I can't
[18356.30s -> 18376.60s]  leave. Why can't I leave? This is not okay. This is not a boss back behind you, right?
[18377.32s -> 18384.52s]  Impenetrable thorns refuse all. None may enter the urd tree.
[18385.40s -> 18405.99s]  Can't go on the urd tree. Why not? I'll level up. All right. That was crazy. I'm so glad I had a
[18407.35s -> 18417.32s]  mirror of myself to come in and fucking help. What are you doing here?
[18417.32s -> 18434.18s]  Converse with you. You were unable to enter the tree prevented by the mantle of the thorns
[18434.18s -> 18442.90s]  are impenetrable a husk of the trees being that spurns all that exists without the only way to
[18442.90s -> 18450.55s]  stand before the Elden ring. I'm telling you right now, the Elden Lord is having trouble with this
[18450.55s -> 18462.39s]  game. I'll get the mimic. So I'd like you to undertake a new journey with me to the flame of
[18462.39s -> 18473.69s]  ruin far above the cloud upon the snowy mountain tops of the giants. Then I can set the tree a
[18473.69s -> 18480.15s]  flame. Burn the urd tree down the path. I don't trust a word. I don't trust anything this lady's
[18480.15s -> 18497.53s]  saying. A red mark was made on the map. Okay. So now we're going to do 50 intelligence.
[18500.28s -> 18516.07s]  That's what I want. Oh, where is it on the map? I'm curious. So it is another area. All right.
[18516.07s -> 18521.45s]  That's it. That's it. I'm going to bed. But honest to God, if you're having a lot of trouble with
[18521.45s -> 18526.39s]  this game and you're like, dude, I can't fucking do it. I just can't do it. If you're been,
[18526.39s -> 18530.95s]  if you've been hitting your head against a wall, just going, I keep losing this guy 100 times. I
[18530.95s -> 18537.26s]  actually can't play the game. I actually can't do it. That mimic really made that fight very,
[18537.26s -> 18543.46s]  very manageable and not, I wouldn't say the word is like the words, not easy, but like manageable.
[18546.71s -> 18550.95s]  I am going to try to beat most of the encounters in this game without that because I feel like that
[18550.95s -> 18559.11s]  was, uh, I did not think it was going to do that much damage. I really did not think that was going
[18559.11s -> 18568.42s]  to be that ridiculous. That's the first time I've used that item. I leveled it up like five or six
[18568.42s -> 18574.84s]  times or seven times. Maybe I, that's the first time I've used it as a boss and just watched him
[18574.84s -> 18584.87s]  kill the boss. That was ridiculous. Mimic is really OP. It makes every single boss that easy. Really
[18584.87s -> 18589.83s]  damn. But I mean, but seriously though, like if you, if you're having like a lot of trouble
[18591.43s -> 18594.71s]  and you just kind of, you really want to be able to progress and you really want to go level up,
[18594.71s -> 18601.90s]  go get the mimic, that'll help you. They will. Um, I probably won't be using it for the remainder
[18601.90s -> 18607.40s]  of the time that I play the game. Not that I, not that I'm looking down on it or anything. I just,
[18607.40s -> 18615.14s]  I, I thought I, I almost beat that guy first try. Uh, so I'm only going to use it if I really need
[18615.14s -> 18625.98s]  it. Really, really, really need it. Not every boss. Some are fucking insane. Yeah. Again,
[18625.98s -> 18632.06s]  I'm not looking down on using the item. I, uh, if I can do it without it, I'm going to try to do it
[18632.06s -> 18646.60s]  without it. You'll be using it on commander Neil. Okay. Well, good to know. Uh, all right. Same with
[18646.60s -> 18652.60s]  the Katana. No, I mean, like everything is viable. You don't, you don't, don't let anybody tell you,
[18652.60s -> 18656.68s]  you can't use a certain item. If you, if you haven't fun and you're playing through the game,
[18656.68s -> 18662.28s]  then use it. There's no reason not to, right? Uh, I think the most fun I've had in the game so far,
[18662.28s -> 18667.74s]  I think I can give this an assessment, a real review, like of sorts. The most fun I've had in
[18667.74s -> 18675.18s]  the game has not been at the boss fights, like the main story fights. It's been exploring the world.
[18675.18s -> 18679.58s]  It's been finding a dungeon. It's been getting killed somewhere in a spot that you're like,
[18679.58s -> 18686.06s]  holy shit, where even am I? I love the areas. I love the actual huge open world as hard as it is
[18686.06s -> 18692.10s]  and as crazy as it's been, right? Um, I actually liked that more than the actual boss fights.
[18692.10s -> 18696.52s]  So, but yeah, I'm going to try to beat step on my own. I'm going to try to beat it without
[18696.52s -> 18705.83s]  using too many of the, uh, powerful summons or anything. We'll see if I can do it. But yeah,
[18706.39s -> 18712.54s]  that was ridiculous. I'm glad I at least got to kill it and I will see you guys. The next stream
[18712.54s -> 18718.84s]  is going to be, well, interestingly enough, uh, it will be Saturday, although I will not be
[18718.84s -> 18724.62s]  streaming. I am going to be at the streamer awards. So you're probably going to see me.
[18724.62s -> 18729.08s]  I'm going to be presenting one of the awards. Hopefully I look okay in a suit. Hopefully I
[18729.08s -> 18737.05s]  look all right. Uh, uh, it's going to be fun. Looking forward to it. Jano's nominated for two
[18737.05s -> 18744.52s]  awards. We'll see what happens. I mean, I, that'd be cool, but there's tons of great nominees. So
[18744.52s -> 18749.45s]  it's, it's very, very competitive from what I would, uh, what I would assume.
[18749.45s -> 18763.50s]  Very good nominees. You're handsome. Hey, yeah, I'm going to do all the side stuff too,
[18763.50s -> 18770.74s]  or at least a lot of it. So I will be back on my channel on the 14th or the 15th. Even I and the
[18770.74s -> 18776.89s]  sus either that Monday or Tuesday trying to figure out when I will actually be around the stream.
[18776.89s -> 18789.00s]  Sorry for turning out purple, although that was probably very funny. I hope you got a laugh.
[18789.00s -> 18797.70s]  Don't growl again. I won't. I promise. All right. I, uh, I'm going to let the credits play out.
[18797.70s -> 18801.50s]  Oh, that's right. I put that in there. I'm going to save the game. I'm going to be right here.
[18801.50s -> 18805.74s]  Thanks so much for watching guys. This was a long one. I planned for it to be long cause I knew that
[18805.74s -> 18809.93s]  I wasn't going to be around for like six days probably. And I've been trying to stream this
[18809.93s -> 18815.80s]  game a lot cause I think it's great. I think it's amazing, but I will see you guys later.
[18815.80s -> 18819.08s]  If you're going to watch streamer awards, go ahead and watch it. It'll be on cutie Cinderella's
[18819.08s -> 18825.72s]  channel. I have a fantastic evening, of course, rest of your night. I'm going to get some sleep.
[18825.72s -> 18833.70s]  I got a lot to do tomorrow. Yeah. And I'm going to let this play out.
[18844.50s -> 18853.64s]  I didn't mean for that to play us out, but it did. Is this the longest stream? No,
[18853.64s -> 18873.45s]  my longest stream. I think was 14 hours is Lord of the rings. Uh, the two towers
[18873.45s -> 18874.81s]  mauled of the rings.
[18883.83s -> 18895.80s]  Simpsons was close. Simpsons. I think was 12, 12 and a half, 13. All right. I'll see you guys later.
[18895.80s -> 18900.01s]  Thanks for all the subs everybody. I haven't really been paying too much attention to anything
[18900.01s -> 18911.48s]  that's coming through a brain's been focused pretty much the whole time. So what is,
[18911.48s -> 18918.58s]  let me ask you this. Those of you that has to finish the game, what remains if, okay,
[18918.58s -> 18924.02s]  let's say I were to walk down the main story campaign hallway and you just go down the main
[18924.02s -> 18939.05s]  story campaign, how much is left? What'd you say? I'll be around somewhere on 80% done. Okay.
[18939.05s -> 18945.48s]  Maybe like two or three streams. There's a, there's another map. There's another. Yeah.
[18947.86s -> 18958.63s]  God, this game is so big. I'll be about 15 to 20 hours. Okay. So I'll do it. I'll come. I'll
[18958.63s -> 18973.69s]  finish it on stream. At least I'll try to still about the still four main bosses remaining.
[18973.69s -> 18986.57s]  Really? I was thinking two. All right. Good night guys. I'll see you later. Catch me on
[18986.57s -> 18993.03s]  the streamer awards. Have a great evening. Have a great weekend. Take care of yourselves. Good night.
