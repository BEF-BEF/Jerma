[1.72s -> 6.70s]  You guys, how are you? What's up? How are you doing?
[6.70s -> 9.69s]  Hi. Yeah, sorry I'm late. Yeah, yeah I know.
[9.69s -> 16.31s]  For those of you that were not in the pre-stream chat, and the reason why I am late,
[16.95s -> 22.97s]  I got an emergency phone call. Uh, nothing weird happened.
[22.97s -> 26.65s]  Nothing out of the ordinary. I had an emergency call.
[30.20s -> 35.40s]  I had to take it. And it was, uh, you know, I just had to make sure I took the call.
[35.40s -> 38.20s]  And it was important about, um, financial stuff.
[38.20s -> 40.20s]  And I went to make sure I got my financial stuff in order.
[40.92s -> 44.28s]  And, um, a few things about, like, a recipe that I needed for my mother.
[45.24s -> 48.92s]  Um, said nothing weird happened or anything, but sorry about that.
[49.72s -> 55.43s]  Yeah, I mean, it's like tax season and shit.
[55.43s -> 57.51s]  Like, I'm just trying to make sure I, like, I, you know,
[57.51s -> 60.15s]  cross all my t's and dot on my i's. You know what I'm saying?
[62.87s -> 67.03s]  I absolutely did not do something incredibly disgusting and embarrassing.
[67.03s -> 69.35s]  Well, yuck. Why would that happen?
[69.35s -> 73.51s]  Like, clog your toilet with your massive pastrami sandwich shit you had yesterday.
[73.51s -> 75.83s]  No way. Not, that didn't happen at all.
[76.55s -> 78.39s]  But frankly, it's revolting that you're saying it.
[83.74s -> 86.62s]  Like, why would that happen? Like, you guys are disgusting.
[86.62s -> 87.74s]  Do you see what people are writing?
[90.46s -> 93.26s]  Look, those are the that joined us after pre-stream chat.
[94.22s -> 96.78s]  Look at, look at how fucked up this community is.
[97.66s -> 99.82s]  I didn't, what is, what are they talking about?
[100.70s -> 103.34s]  Oh, look, Jerma the serial killer. Here we go again, right?
[103.34s -> 107.56s]  I'm so sick of this. Whatever.
[112.14s -> 114.23s]  Oh, how you doing?
[114.23s -> 116.71s]  Hope you had a good Christmas. Merry Christmas if I didn't see you.
[117.35s -> 119.43s]  I did see you, though. The day before Christmas.
[123.18s -> 125.34s]  Uh, I, I had a great Christmas. It was good.
[126.06s -> 130.63s]  I got a new wallet. It's nice.
[132.02s -> 135.22s]  I got some bath stuff because I'm a big bath guy, you know me.
[135.86s -> 143.56s]  Hey, thank you, Santa, for the five community subs.
[144.12s -> 149.54s]  Wham, wham, wham, deal with it, entertainer.
[149.54s -> 155.85s]  This is a boring title. What the hell?
[160.22s -> 161.82s]  We peeped the toilet. No, you can't.
[164.82s -> 167.46s]  Boring title. I don't even know what the game is.
[167.46s -> 169.30s]  I just, everyone told me to play it.
[169.30s -> 172.79s]  It looks cool. It's got buying and trading.
[172.79s -> 173.83s]  So, you know, I'm going to like it.
[174.39s -> 177.80s]  It was, it was Satan. Oh, thank you, Satan.
[183.86s -> 188.02s]  Yeah, this is, this is called Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.
[189.16s -> 191.16s]  It's a game where you fly around the galaxy
[191.80s -> 195.08s]  and you buy and sell organs of aliens.
[197.50s -> 200.06s]  I, it was recommended a bunch of times.
[200.06s -> 201.58s]  Like I said, I am ready.
[202.38s -> 203.66s]  I am ready to give it a try.
[205.66s -> 206.46s]  Question is, are you?
[209.46s -> 218.94s]  All right, so let me turn this up just a tad with my microphone here.
[228.10s -> 229.38s]  You ever played Rimworld?
[229.38s -> 230.82s]  No, it's too complicated for me.
[235.00s -> 237.00s]  Looks like a fun game. Too complicated for my brain.
[240.22s -> 242.38s]  Is that better? Can you guys hear me better now?
[242.94s -> 244.46s]  All right, I'm going to do some tests for you.
[245.02s -> 247.18s]  So you tell me if this is too much or too little.
[247.18s -> 254.60s]  Ready?
[255.40s -> 256.60s]  Too loud? You want more?
[265.43s -> 269.37s]  Better? How's this? Is this better?
[269.93s -> 274.17s]  Is this one good? What if I scream though?
[274.17s -> 275.53s]  Like, okay, I'm going to turn it down.
[279.22s -> 283.99s]  Better? Trying to get my audio settings better.
[287.45s -> 289.13s]  More? Is that better? Perfect.
[290.30s -> 292.79s]  All right, let's see. Let's just go.
[295.54s -> 296.34s]  Sounds good. Okay.
[296.98s -> 298.62s]  Maybe do a little more. We'll see.
[299.26s -> 304.76s]  Well, this is organ trader simulator.
[308.02s -> 308.90s]  I'm very curious.
[314.17s -> 315.13s]  Was my FPS weird?
[320.54s -> 323.58s]  Wait, what? What do you mean 23 Hertz?
[324.38s -> 328.30s]  Is this a fucking CRT TV on an iMac from like 1995?
[329.10s -> 330.14s]  Why does it look like this?
[330.86s -> 332.39s]  What's happening? Hold on.
[332.39s -> 341.10s]  This is weird. How can you even do 23 Hertz?
[341.10s -> 342.86s]  That's crazy. It's because it's cinematic.
[343.82s -> 349.91s]  Oh, I see. All right.
[349.91s -> 352.31s]  144 Hertz at 1440p.
[355.14s -> 356.50s]  I actually hate selecting this.
[357.06s -> 360.90s]  I am one of those old boomer people that really does.
[360.90s -> 363.86s]  I like 1080p. I don't want any.
[363.86s -> 367.86s]  I don't want 1440p. I don't want 2560.
[367.86s -> 368.50s]  It's too high.
[371.86s -> 372.90s]  Text effect? Wiggle?
[373.70s -> 375.22s]  No, I don't make the Alpuc.
[376.58s -> 377.30s]  Music's all right.
[377.94s -> 378.74s]  All right, I'm going to apply.
[378.74s -> 379.94s]  Hopefully the stream isn't crashed.
[380.82s -> 382.97s]  Oh, look at how much better that is.
[383.61s -> 388.04s]  No wiggle? No, no, no wiggling.
[388.04s -> 389.72s]  No, I don't like when shit moves around.
[390.28s -> 391.58s]  Was this full screen?
[392.65s -> 393.37s]  Okay, that's fine.
[393.93s -> 395.05s]  Are you ready?
[396.44s -> 397.64s]  I'm not turning the wiggle on.
[398.28s -> 400.06s]  The wiggle's not going on.
[400.06s -> 403.29s]  Set the stream to 1080.
[408.66s -> 409.22s]  We're going to go.
[410.02s -> 414.14s]  I'm very curious about this game for you guys.
[414.14s -> 414.54s]  There you are.
[416.97s -> 417.53s]  Uh, thank you.
[417.53s -> 420.17s]  Thanks to usually Zane MysticQuests
[420.17s -> 423.53s]  and anonymousgifter for the five, five, ten, five community subs.
[424.09s -> 425.32s]  All right, I'm ready. Let's go.
[426.04s -> 428.73s]  Great new game.
[429.37s -> 430.41s]  Who are you?
[430.41s -> 431.53s]  Dog. No.
[432.33s -> 433.21s]  Dog with a hat on.
[433.93s -> 439.14s]  Wait, what the fuck?
[441.75s -> 445.51s]  All right, a, uh, the mage from Final Fantasy.
[447.21s -> 447.53s]  Sus.
[448.25s -> 449.66s]  Frog.
[450.38s -> 450.70s]  Frog.
[451.26s -> 455.50s]  The guy from that Netflix show with like the super powered people.
[455.50s -> 456.54s]  They live in a mansion together.
[456.86s -> 459.29s]  Explosion guy.
[460.84s -> 461.32s]  Double Knight.
[462.94s -> 465.26s]  The new ice cube thing that people do on Twitch right now.
[468.25s -> 468.81s]  Spider-Man.
[469.37s -> 471.24s]  Peter Parker.
[471.24s -> 473.90s]  This guy.
[473.90s -> 483.58s]  I don't think you understand your position.
[483.58s -> 485.02s]  I cannot touch you.
[485.66s -> 490.04s]  You are an organ trader, a supplier of meaty demand
[490.04s -> 495.02s]  with a moral flexibility ranging in the parsecs.
[495.02s -> 500.07s]  You buy organs, you sell organs, you take on client requests
[500.07s -> 504.15s]  and fulfill them and use their money to fuel your future.
[504.15s -> 504.63s]  Why is it?
[504.63s -> 505.83s]  This person's talking like me.
[505.83s -> 507.19s]  I type like this.
[507.19s -> 512.07s]  This is how I talk in chat.
[512.07s -> 516.55s]  You buy, you fulfill them and use their money to fuel your future.
[517.72s -> 518.28s]  I don't know.
[518.28s -> 519.96s]  I like emphasizing words.
[519.96s -> 527.13s]  You will not lose money fulfilling a request unless you want to.
[527.77s -> 530.90s]  You cannot be held accountable for your actions.
[530.90s -> 532.10s]  Everyone has organs.
[532.74s -> 535.86s]  Everyone wants organs and everyone needs organs.
[536.12s -> 538.12s]  Which means they need you.
[538.12s -> 541.38s]  This is an angry YouTube comment.
[545.00s -> 545.80s]  They need us.
[549.80s -> 551.32s]  So congratulations.
[551.32s -> 554.98s]  The universe is your fleshy parasitic playground.
[554.98s -> 557.94s]  Everyone else just lives in it.
[557.94s -> 558.58s]  Can you stall?
[559.46s -> 560.50s]  What do you mean can I stall?
[560.50s -> 562.44s]  It's 4 30.
[562.44s -> 564.60s]  I was supposed to start a half an hour ago.
[564.60s -> 567.24s]  Don't worry.
[567.24s -> 568.92s]  You can, you don't have to turn laundry over.
[568.92s -> 572.84s]  You can leave the laundry in the washing machine for at least like 30 to 40 minutes.
[573.40s -> 575.32s]  Anything over an hour or two, that's bad.
[575.32s -> 576.52s]  You're going to have to rewash.
[576.52s -> 577.00s]  Just saying.
[581.14s -> 582.66s]  Scroll and then left and right.
[583.88s -> 584.12s]  Okay.
[585.40s -> 586.63s]  Oh, shit.
[586.63s -> 586.95s]  Okay.
[586.95s -> 587.27s]  How much?
[587.27s -> 588.71s]  I have 2,300 bucks.
[589.99s -> 591.27s]  Type, size, trade.
[592.31s -> 593.80s]  So I got this.
[594.76s -> 596.04s]  Cargo and holds.
[597.58s -> 598.06s]  Personal.
[599.06s -> 599.38s]  Holds.
[599.38s -> 600.02s]  I like to click.
[600.02s -> 600.50s]  I'm slow.
[601.22s -> 601.72s]  Okay.
[601.72s -> 602.36s]  Q and E.
[602.36s -> 602.76s]  I don't like it.
[602.76s -> 603.16s]  It's too fast.
[603.16s -> 604.12s]  I feel like I'm playing StarCraft.
[605.42s -> 605.66s]  Okay.
[605.66s -> 606.38s]  So holds.
[606.38s -> 607.18s]  Where am I?
[607.18s -> 608.14s]  What's my favorite organ?
[608.86s -> 611.24s]  The spleen.
[611.96s -> 614.98s]  So day zero.
[614.98s -> 615.46s]  Personal.
[616.55s -> 617.11s]  Title.
[617.11s -> 617.99s]  Scum.
[617.99s -> 618.71s]  Current face.
[618.71s -> 619.35s]  This.
[619.35s -> 620.23s]  2,300 credits.
[620.79s -> 622.09s]  Reputation progression.
[622.09s -> 623.13s]  Reputation credits.
[623.13s -> 624.01s]  Stock portfolio.
[624.01s -> 626.14s]  So you trade stocks.
[626.14s -> 627.50s]  Organs touched.
[627.50s -> 629.80s]  Intestines owned in meters.
[631.43s -> 632.39s]  Breaths taken.
[632.39s -> 633.59s]  What the fuck is this?
[634.65s -> 635.45s]  All right.
[635.45s -> 639.53s]  So this is just like my personal little card here.
[639.53s -> 642.94s]  So this is what I'm hold, holds.
[644.22s -> 644.86s]  Refer.
[644.86s -> 645.34s]  Oh, okay.
[645.34s -> 646.38s]  So I can upgrade my shit.
[647.10s -> 650.33s]  Close decay of all organs by 25%.
[650.33s -> 651.61s]  Oh, I'm going to be into this game.
[651.61s -> 651.93s]  Let's see.
[651.93s -> 652.17s]  Wait.
[653.11s -> 653.83s]  A cargo.
[656.25s -> 656.49s]  Okay.
[656.49s -> 658.52s]  I only have what?
[658.52s -> 659.16s]  Five slots?
[659.16s -> 659.72s]  Six slots?
[660.70s -> 662.30s]  Don't breathe for two minutes and see what happens.
[662.30s -> 664.46s]  Don't ever fucking don't breathe for two minutes.
[664.46s -> 664.86s]  Breathe.
[665.42s -> 667.80s]  Don't play these dumb games.
[667.80s -> 668.04s]  No.
[669.48s -> 669.72s]  Refill.
[672.34s -> 673.46s]  Audio log?
[673.46s -> 674.34s]  Is this a guitar?
[674.34s -> 678.94s]  What does a guitar want with an organ?
[678.94s -> 683.10s]  Or is this just the annoying guy that I call that plays this first and then says hello?
[683.66s -> 689.77s]  Okay.
[689.77s -> 690.41s]  Here we go.
[690.41s -> 690.89s]  Refill.
[690.89s -> 691.13s]  All right.
[691.13s -> 691.93s]  What about trade?
[691.93s -> 692.65s]  Can I trade?
[692.65s -> 693.69s]  How do I know what people want?
[694.25s -> 696.07s]  Can I go trade?
[696.07s -> 696.63s]  Trade.
[696.63s -> 697.51s]  The market is open.
[697.51s -> 698.07s]  What?
[698.07s -> 699.35s]  What do you mean the market's open?
[699.35s -> 699.59s]  Buy?
[700.55s -> 701.40s]  What is this?
[702.12s -> 703.54s]  This is a liver.
[703.54s -> 704.34s]  It's a large liver.
[704.34s -> 706.10s]  It's in a 46 blood type B+.
[706.10s -> 706.66s]  What do people...
[706.66s -> 706.98s]  Wait, wait.
[706.98s -> 707.46s]  Request.
[708.34s -> 709.14s]  Hello, scum.
[711.85s -> 712.41s]  Hello.
[712.41s -> 713.45s]  Right now you're nothing.
[713.45s -> 716.01s]  They wouldn't trust you to trade shoes and we're going to fix that.
[716.01s -> 717.77s]  Get me a stomach and make something in yourself.
[718.65s -> 719.61s]  I only have two minutes.
[719.61s -> 719.77s]  All right.
[719.77s -> 720.49s]  I'll get your stomach.
[721.21s -> 722.87s]  I a stomach.
[723.59s -> 725.18s]  This is a heart.
[726.07s -> 726.39s]  Liver.
[727.27s -> 727.77s]  Heart.
[728.57s -> 728.81s]  Heart.
[729.37s -> 730.01s]  Liver.
[730.01s -> 730.97s]  There are no stomachs.
[733.27s -> 733.83s]  Stomach.
[733.83s -> 734.07s]  All right.
[734.07s -> 734.87s]  Blood type AB.

[736.63s -> 737.91s]  Natural, neutral flesh.
[737.91s -> 738.87s]  No special traits.
[739.43s -> 741.69s]  Can I filter stomachs?
[742.41s -> 744.78s]  This one's cheap.
[746.42s -> 747.62s]  Rarity rough.
[747.62s -> 748.82s]  Rarity rare.
[748.82s -> 749.46s]  150.
[750.02s -> 751.11s]  I'm going to buy this.
[751.67s -> 752.49s]  Okay.
[752.49s -> 752.89s]  Request.
[755.10s -> 755.50s]  Where are you?
[755.50s -> 755.82s]  Fulfill.
[756.46s -> 757.70s]  Hey, I got you.
[757.70s -> 758.10s]  I got it.
[758.66s -> 759.78s]  Reputation descended.
[759.78s -> 760.10s]  Trash.
[760.74s -> 762.02s]  What do you mean?
[762.02s -> 762.50s]  What?
[762.50s -> 763.46s]  New organs on log.
[763.46s -> 763.86s]  What did I do?
[765.06s -> 765.86s]  Breaking the...
[765.86s -> 766.02s]  Wait.
[766.02s -> 766.42s]  What do you want?
[766.42s -> 767.70s]  This guy's got $5,000.
[769.80s -> 771.40s]  Want cold companions.
[772.12s -> 773.72s]  In high gravity on cold nights,
[773.72s -> 775.96s]  I like to clutch a warm lung between my fingers.
[775.96s -> 777.32s]  I need another one for a friend.
[777.32s -> 777.56s]  All right.
[777.56s -> 778.84s]  You want a warm lung?
[778.84s -> 779.32s]  What do you want?
[779.88s -> 781.32s]  I need an eyeball.
[782.33s -> 782.81s]  Okay.
[782.81s -> 784.01s]  Lung and eyeball.
[784.01s -> 785.45s]  There's too many people that want stuff.
[786.25s -> 786.49s]  All right.
[787.13s -> 788.01s]  Can I filter?
[788.57s -> 790.55s]  This is $4,300.
[791.35s -> 793.82s]  I don't have that kind of money.
[794.54s -> 795.88s]  I know I've done that.
[799.45s -> 800.73s]  $4,300 eyeball right here.
[801.29s -> 802.09s]  This one's common.
[802.09s -> 802.89s]  Buy it.
[802.89s -> 805.26s]  I don't have enough to buy.
[807.02s -> 808.76s]  Oh, right here, right here.
[808.76s -> 809.80s]  B plus rarity rough.
[810.44s -> 811.32s]  Just buy it.
[811.32s -> 815.03s]  How much are you going to give me for this?
[817.02s -> 817.66s]  Oh my God.
[817.66s -> 818.46s]  It was a lot of money.
[818.46s -> 818.70s]  Okay.
[818.70s -> 818.94s]  Yeah.
[818.94s -> 819.90s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[819.90s -> 820.46s]  Fulfill, fulfill.
[820.46s -> 820.94s]  Holy shit.
[820.94s -> 821.10s]  Yeah.
[821.10s -> 821.42s]  I got it.
[821.42s -> 821.74s]  I get it.
[822.46s -> 823.50s]  That's how much they want to give you.
[823.50s -> 823.82s]  All right.
[828.62s -> 829.34s]  Uh, what do you want?
[829.90s -> 832.84s]  Three more.
[832.84s -> 833.56s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[833.56s -> 834.12s]  I want a heart.
[834.12s -> 835.64s]  Now give me a heart above 74.
[835.64s -> 836.36s]  I got 10 seconds.
[843.74s -> 845.10s]  Oh, I got it.
[845.10s -> 845.34s]  What?
[845.98s -> 850.81s]  What the hell?
[851.45s -> 852.26s]  I got scammed?
[852.90s -> 855.21s]  You got to go quick.
[855.77s -> 857.62s]  Okay.
[857.62s -> 858.10s]  What about...
[858.74s -> 860.66s]  This is day one.
[860.66s -> 863.14s]  Do I have any?
[863.14s -> 863.86s]  Oh, I don't have to.
[863.86s -> 864.98s]  I don't have to sell it immediately.
[864.98s -> 865.70s]  I can just buy it.
[865.70s -> 866.74s]  The condition was wrong.
[870.89s -> 871.45s]  Oh, okay.
[871.45s -> 873.93s]  So my reputation enabled eternal war effort.
[873.93s -> 874.09s]  What?
[874.89s -> 878.42s]  It was 90 though.
[878.42s -> 878.82s]  Yeah.
[878.82s -> 879.46s]  I thought it was high.
[880.18s -> 881.30s]  You scammed them.
[886.36s -> 886.76s]  I did?
[887.48s -> 889.08s]  My reputation is going kind of high.
[890.23s -> 890.55s]  All right.
[890.55s -> 892.07s]  Listen, this is kind of cool.
[892.07s -> 893.67s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[893.67s -> 896.39s]  So can I do anything else with money?
[896.39s -> 897.59s]  I just have to buy a bunch of shit.
[897.59s -> 901.59s]  Can I, can I filter or do I have to actually scroll?
[902.23s -> 903.45s]  It was...
[903.45s -> 905.98s]  Oh, you only got two minutes of too much pressure.
[906.54s -> 911.37s]  High reputation, you trash.
[911.37s -> 912.01s]  It won't be for long.
[912.57s -> 914.31s]  You just have to scroll.
[914.31s -> 914.63s]  All right.
[915.27s -> 918.90s]  25 gram.
[918.90s -> 919.94s]  What does this get me?
[919.94s -> 923.11s]  A refrigeration unit welded onto the space.
[923.67s -> 926.07s]  A cargo hold should occupy and miraculously it works.
[926.71s -> 928.55s]  You don't have to do requests.
[928.55s -> 930.41s]  Really?
[930.41s -> 932.41s]  I'm gonna go for it again.
[932.41s -> 932.81s]  Let's go.
[933.45s -> 933.77s]  Rating.
[934.92s -> 935.40s]  Argo.
[936.12s -> 936.44s]  Bye.
[939.05s -> 939.37s]  All right.
[939.37s -> 939.85s]  What's...
[939.85s -> 940.41s]  How can I see the...
[942.17s -> 944.65s]  Warlord Orbis always wants to greet new traders.
[945.45s -> 946.25s]  With a gift.
[946.25s -> 948.17s]  Says it helps grease the wheels for everyone.
[948.17s -> 950.09s]  Would a mythic heart be useful?
[952.07s -> 954.97s]  Uh, yeah.
[959.66s -> 960.22s]  Can I sell it?
[963.14s -> 963.46s]  All right.
[964.02s -> 966.50s]  Small, condition 68, blood type zero.
[967.06s -> 967.46s]  Mythic.
[968.90s -> 971.30s]  I can sell this for 2,500 bucks right now.
[971.30s -> 972.26s]  No, I'm holding it.
[972.82s -> 973.86s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[973.86s -> 974.50s]  What do people want?
[975.54s -> 975.94s]  What do you want?
[976.97s -> 977.93s]  You want a...
[977.93s -> 978.57s]  I want a stomach.
[978.57s -> 980.49s]  I don't think about the thunder of the war harvesters or the...
[980.49s -> 981.13s]  I just want a stomach.
[981.13s -> 981.85s]  All right, you want a stomach?
[981.85s -> 982.73s]  I'll get you a cheap stomach.
[984.06s -> 984.46s]  Stomach.
[985.10s -> 986.95s]  It's a liver.
[986.95s -> 987.35s]  Stomach.
[987.99s -> 989.19s]  How much was he going to pay me?
[989.19s -> 989.75s]  I don't remember.
[990.55s -> 993.88s]  Stomach.
[994.52s -> 995.48s]  How much was he going to get?
[995.48s -> 996.12s]  Is this a bad idea?
[998.36s -> 998.92s]  Yeah, okay.
[998.92s -> 999.32s]  Got it.
[999.88s -> 1003.74s]  Wait, what?
[1004.46s -> 1004.86s]  What happened?
[1004.86s -> 1005.42s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1005.42s -> 1005.98s]  Oh, fulfill.
[1005.98s -> 1006.22s]  Shit.
[1007.02s -> 1008.54s]  Wait, what do you want?
[1008.54s -> 1010.26s]  I need an eyeball.
[1010.90s -> 1011.46s]  Filled that.
[1013.78s -> 1014.34s]  I'm holding this.
[1014.98s -> 1016.42s]  I'm not selling this yet.
[1017.22s -> 1018.50s]  Uh, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[1018.50s -> 1019.62s]  You're going to be a thousand bucks for...
[1020.50s -> 1022.18s]  That's a warm heart.
[1022.18s -> 1022.82s]  I want a heart.
[1022.90s -> 1024.10s]  You're not getting the one that's in here.
[1024.10s -> 1024.90s]  So I got to buy something cheap.
[1024.90s -> 1025.46s]  Warm heart.
[1026.50s -> 1026.98s]  No.
[1029.67s -> 1030.15s]  No, eyeball.
[1032.39s -> 1033.11s]  What the fuck?
[1033.11s -> 1036.07s]  These are so expensive.
[1036.79s -> 1037.59s]  This one's not bad.
[1037.59s -> 1039.08s]  All right, bye.
[1039.80s -> 1040.76s]  This is going to be a thousand bucks.
[1042.98s -> 1044.02s]  I made a hundred dollars on that.
[1044.66s -> 1045.70s]  Made a couple hundred dollars on that.
[1046.74s -> 1050.38s]  Can I see the chart on this?
[1051.10s -> 1052.06s]  I want to see the chart.
[1053.58s -> 1055.90s]  Maybe do I unlock a chart?
[1055.90s -> 1056.94s]  The dev is in the chat.
[1057.82s -> 1058.46s]  Going on, dev.
[1059.72s -> 1060.60s]  I can do another quest.
[1060.60s -> 1064.71s]  200, do you want me to give a...
[1064.71s -> 1065.75s]  200, do you want me to give a...
[1067.59s -> 1068.79s]  You need to give me a stomach.
[1068.79s -> 1070.39s]  For 200 bucks, bro.
[1073.11s -> 1074.87s]  No, I need a cheap stomach.
[1074.87s -> 1075.37s]  There we go.
[1079.77s -> 1080.81s]  Oh, I got...
[1080.81s -> 1081.45s]  I ascended.
[1081.45s -> 1082.09s]  I'm dubious.
[1083.13s -> 1084.65s]  New organs unlocked.
[1084.65s -> 1087.58s]  The dev in chat said you have to put a face cam on.
[1087.58s -> 1088.78s]  I don't have any clothes on, so I can't.
[1089.66s -> 1090.62s]  Maybe I should just buy something.
[1092.26s -> 1094.18s]  Rarity, rough, rarity, common, condition.
[1094.18s -> 1095.38s]  This is in such bad condition.
[1095.38s -> 1096.10s]  Should I buy something?
[1098.34s -> 1098.84s]  Um...
[1100.18s -> 1100.68s]  Ooh.
[1103.51s -> 1104.01s]  All right.
[1105.11s -> 1106.30s]  What's wrong?
[1106.70s -> 1111.50s]  All right, where will my car go?
[1112.14s -> 1114.57s]  This thing was worth...
[1114.57s -> 1115.93s]  I lost a little bit on this.
[1115.93s -> 1116.89s]  Why is that an excuse?
[1117.53s -> 1118.81s]  I don't have clothes on.
[1119.61s -> 1120.89s]  I'm not going to stream naked.
[1125.18s -> 1125.90s]  All right, I leveled up.
[1127.20s -> 1129.04s]  Now I know why it's Q and E.
[1129.92s -> 1132.32s]  Because this is a game where you have to go very fast.
[1132.32s -> 1134.32s]  Oh god, this is going to be fucking horrible.
[1135.36s -> 1139.13s]  We won't tell Twitch.
[1141.24s -> 1141.74s]  No.
[1142.20s -> 1144.94s]  By the way, I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[1146.43s -> 1149.15s]  The New Year's Eve voting is open.
[1149.79s -> 1150.97s]  I'm going to give you a link.
[1155.61s -> 1158.17s]  You can now go vote if you haven't already.
[1158.81s -> 1161.52s]  I'm going to paste it.
[1161.52s -> 1163.52s]  Actually, I think some of the mods probably have it already, but...
[1164.62s -> 1165.12s]  Let's see.
[1165.66s -> 1168.00s]  It is.
[1168.86s -> 1169.58s]  I'll get it to you.
[1171.18s -> 1174.22s]  This is going to take you a while, potentially, just to let you know.
[1174.94s -> 1183.52s]  There are 26 categories this year.
[1184.08s -> 1189.12s]  Now make sure you take a lot of time to understand and figure out which one of your favorite errands
[1189.92s -> 1190.89s]  of the year it was.
[1191.85s -> 1194.17s]  There were so many best and worst noises.
[1196.22s -> 1196.72s]  We...
[1197.10s -> 1198.06s]  You guys don't understand.
[1199.02s -> 1202.22s]  The noise categories had to get split up into four plus.
[1202.22s -> 1203.74s]  I think three or four of different categories.
[1205.00s -> 1206.28s]  And then they had to get whittled down.
[1206.28s -> 1210.92s]  There were like hundreds of best and worst noise nominees.
[1210.92s -> 1211.42s]  Hundreds.
[1213.52s -> 1214.02s]  Too many.
[1216.80s -> 1218.64s]  Yeah, there is worst beater as well.
[1218.64s -> 1219.92s]  I don't know. I just felt like putting it there.
[1219.92s -> 1221.36s]  I didn't think anyone was going to nominate anything.
[1221.36s -> 1222.08s]  I thought it would be funny.
[1224.25s -> 1225.05s]  Oh yeah.
[1225.05s -> 1226.49s]  That's going to close in a few days.
[1226.49s -> 1228.01s]  You only have like four days to do that.
[1229.08s -> 1230.20s]  You do want to participate.
[1230.20s -> 1233.24s]  That's only going to be open until probably the 30th at midnight, I would assume.
[1234.89s -> 1235.85s]  Are you naked?
[1235.85s -> 1236.81s]  I am comfortable.
[1239.07s -> 1240.11s]  You say naked.
[1240.11s -> 1240.99s]  I say comfortable.
[1241.85s -> 1242.49s]  Is there a problem?
[1243.29s -> 1245.56s]  All right, let's go.
[1251.29s -> 1253.13s]  I feel like I'm getting the hang of this.
[1253.13s -> 1253.63s]  Traders.
[1255.04s -> 1257.04s]  BribeMate has been installed.
[1257.04s -> 1260.64s]  You can now buy, favor, and earn reputation from fellow traders,
[1260.64s -> 1263.04s]  as well as pay them to stop trading for a day.
[1263.04s -> 1263.54s]  What?
[1264.32s -> 1267.69s]  I can pay other traders to stop trading?
[1268.41s -> 1269.92s]  What's this?
[1273.69s -> 1274.97s]  Name the quartermaster.
[1276.01s -> 1277.93s]  Goal brains, hearts, and lungs.
[1279.72s -> 1281.64s]  Resupplies the scant human colonies.
[1281.64s -> 1283.48s]  Focuses on the bare essentials, just in case.
[1284.36s -> 1287.13s]  So this guy's buying all the brains, hearts, and lungs.
[1287.13s -> 1288.17s]  So I can get rid of this guy.
[1294.52s -> 1295.08s]  Favor.
[1295.08s -> 1295.48s]  So what?
[1295.48s -> 1297.00s]  I get reputation with this guy.
[1297.72s -> 1301.07s]  Or I can just say don't trade tomorrow.
[1303.34s -> 1304.78s]  I'm not comfortable with that yet.
[1305.50s -> 1310.16s]  I don't have enough money to make these like weird moves.
[1311.04s -> 1314.60s]  All right.
[1314.60s -> 1315.10s]  What do I got?
[1315.80s -> 1316.97s]  I still got this.
[1317.69s -> 1319.84s]  Do I have any orders to fulfill?
[1319.84s -> 1320.16s]  I don't.
[1320.16s -> 1320.64s]  All right. I'm ready.
[1320.64s -> 1321.14s]  Let's go.
[1322.88s -> 1323.38s]  Turn it on.
[1327.07s -> 1327.47s]  Yo.
[1327.47s -> 1327.97s]  What?
[1328.35s -> 1328.85s]  What?
[1330.19s -> 1330.59s]  All right.
[1330.59s -> 1331.09s]  What do you got?
[1331.55s -> 1332.03s]  Holy shit.
[1332.03s -> 1332.53s]  What do you need?
[1333.07s -> 1334.68s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1334.68s -> 1335.18s]  You know this.
[1335.96s -> 1337.16s]  Lung replacement.
[1337.16s -> 1338.52s]  See, could you get a lungs?
[1339.24s -> 1349.85s]  I need a good lung and eyeball, lung, and eyeball.
[1349.85s -> 1351.93s]  Two eyes and lungs.
[1352.65s -> 1353.64s]  What's this thing?
[1354.28s -> 1355.98s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[1356.54s -> 1357.50s]  Oh, he's buying shit.
[1357.50s -> 1357.74s]  All right.
[1357.74s -> 1358.94s]  I need lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs.
[1358.94s -> 1359.34s]  What is this?
[1359.34s -> 1359.84s]  Antlers?
[1360.62s -> 1362.13s]  Eyeball?
[1362.59s -> 1365.02s]  This guy's taking all my shit.
[1365.66s -> 1366.16s]  Lungs.
[1366.70s -> 1368.27s]  3,000.
[1368.27s -> 1368.67s]  No, no, no.
[1368.67s -> 1369.17s]  2,100.
[1369.87s -> 1371.82s]  No, no, no.
[1371.82s -> 1372.36s]  I need the eyeball.
[1372.36s -> 1372.86s]  Eyeball.
[1373.32s -> 1375.15s]  This is an eye?
[1375.77s -> 1376.57s]  It's a soul?
[1376.57s -> 1377.69s]  What? You can trade souls?
[1378.25s -> 1380.99s]  I need another eyeball.
[1384.43s -> 1384.93s]  Nice.
[1386.72s -> 1388.32s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[1389.90s -> 1391.26s]  Oh, my God.
[1391.26s -> 1392.70s]  This is rare and it's worth a lot of money.
[1393.42s -> 1393.92s]  I got it.
[1394.46s -> 1397.70s]  We got.
[1398.16s -> 1398.64s]  Holy shit.
[1398.64s -> 1399.28s]  I don't even know.
[1399.28s -> 1400.16s]  I don't even know what they want.
[1400.16s -> 1401.36s]  Just take it before the other guy does.
[1402.08s -> 1402.58s]  What do you want?
[1404.09s -> 1404.97s]  A new soul.
[1407.23s -> 1409.20s]  You want lungs?
[1410.36s -> 1412.68s]  Soul, lung, lung.
[1413.32s -> 1414.60s]  Soul, lung, lung.
[1414.60s -> 1415.64s]  Soul, lung, lung.
[1416.20s -> 1416.70s]  Soul?
[1419.23s -> 1419.73s]  Soul?
[1425.76s -> 1426.26s]  Soul?
[1426.96s -> 1427.52s]  You dick.
[1428.08s -> 1430.92s]  This is too expensive.
[1431.56s -> 1431.96s]  I'm buying.
[1431.96s -> 1432.44s]  This is cheap.
[1432.44s -> 1432.94s]  I don't care.
[1434.92s -> 1438.04s]  Soul, lung, lung.
[1438.04s -> 1438.68s]  Make a mint.
[1439.40s -> 1442.27s]  Learn the secrets of the galaxy's top organ trainers.
[1442.27s -> 1443.63s]  Read organ barcodes.
[1443.63s -> 1445.87s]  All for the low, low price of $730.
[1447.76s -> 1449.04s]  Read organ barcodes?
[1449.92s -> 1455.20s]  What does it do?
[1457.79s -> 1458.43s]  Soul.
[1458.43s -> 1458.93s]  Got it.
[1459.15s -> 1459.95s]  I need two lungs.
[1460.51s -> 1460.83s]  Cheap.
[1460.83s -> 1461.71s]  I need cheap lungs.
[1461.71s -> 1462.67s]  How expensive?
[1462.67s -> 1463.17s]  Cheap.
[1463.55s -> 1469.64s]  That one's good.
[1469.64s -> 1469.96s]  That one's good.
[1469.96s -> 1470.52s]  That one's fine, fine, fine.
[1470.52s -> 1471.48s]  Get that one.
[1471.48s -> 1476.03s]  Oh, bingo.
[1476.03s -> 1476.83s]  Look at this.
[1476.83s -> 1477.33s]  Hell yeah.
[1478.03s -> 1480.35s]  $4,300 for what?
[1480.35s -> 1481.87s]  $4,400 for what?
[1481.87s -> 1482.91s]  I only have 10 seconds.
[1482.91s -> 1483.63s]  I don't even know what he wants.
[1488.28s -> 1488.60s]  Delete it.
[1488.60s -> 1489.16s]  I don't want it.
[1489.16s -> 1489.96s]  Before they get mad at me.
[1490.60s -> 1491.50s]  All right.
[1491.50s -> 1492.06s]  That was a good day.
[1492.78s -> 1498.11s]  Buy cheap balls.
[1498.11s -> 1506.64s]  Your heart's worthless?
[1506.64s -> 1509.42s]  Okay, what?
[1509.42s -> 1510.46s]  It's mythic though.
[1511.96s -> 1513.32s]  Exemplary flesh.
[1513.32s -> 1514.12s]  Inspirational.
[1514.12s -> 1515.96s]  Improves condition of nearby...
[1515.96s -> 1519.93s]  Wait a minute.
[1519.93s -> 1520.43s]  What?
[1521.95s -> 1524.51s]  Improves condition of nearby organs.
[1524.51s -> 1529.08s]  It does?
[1529.08s -> 1531.74s]  Blood type condition 49.
[1531.74s -> 1535.29s]  The heart will...
[1535.29s -> 1535.93s]  Sell the heart.
[1535.93s -> 1537.37s]  The condition gets worse over time.
[1537.37s -> 1537.93s]  Oh, shit.
[1537.93s -> 1538.43s]  Okay.
[1540.81s -> 1542.17s]  So these just drop in...
[1542.17s -> 1542.49s]  All right.
[1542.49s -> 1543.93s]  I bought this for 70 bucks.
[1543.93s -> 1546.80s]  I like this.
[1546.80s -> 1548.81s]  This is fun.
[1551.76s -> 1552.40s]  Mark it.
[1552.40s -> 1552.90s]  Oh.
[1553.68s -> 1554.80s]  Oh, boy.
[1554.80s -> 1555.30s]  Oh, boy.
[1556.25s -> 1556.75s]  Okay.
[1557.37s -> 1559.45s]  The heart index?
[1565.24s -> 1567.08s]  Mark it in for X-Cormix.
[1567.80s -> 1568.52s]  Liver index.
[1570.49s -> 1570.89s]  Lungs.
[1570.89s -> 1572.01s]  The brain index is pretty...
[1572.01s -> 1573.53s]  The brains are doing pretty good.
[1573.53s -> 1574.57s]  Expensive.
[1574.57s -> 1579.85s]  Wait, I can...
[1579.85s -> 1580.92s]  Wait.
[1580.92s -> 1581.64s]  Hold on a minute.
[1581.64s -> 1582.36s]  I can buy...
[1583.00s -> 1584.60s]  These are like ETFs.
[1584.60s -> 1587.98s]  These are organ ETFs.
[1587.98s -> 1593.02s]  So I can just buy essentially a weighted index of the hearts.
[1593.58s -> 1599.56s]  I don't have to buy hearts.
[1599.56s -> 1600.06s]  Okay.
[1600.68s -> 1601.72s]  Because I can buy stock.
[1604.00s -> 1605.12s]  Yes, this is an ETF.
[1605.68s -> 1607.23s]  All right.
[1607.23s -> 1608.03s]  What's cheap right now?
[1610.12s -> 1610.62s]  Eyeballs.
[1616.27s -> 1616.91s]  Uh, okay.
[1616.91s -> 1617.23s]  Hold on.
[1617.23s -> 1617.47s]  Let me...
[1618.11s -> 1619.31s]  This is a lot.
[1619.31s -> 1619.79s]  All right.
[1619.79s -> 1621.15s]  Nothing looks like it's down or anything.
[1622.29s -> 1622.69s]  Yeah.
[1622.69s -> 1623.73s]  I'm not going to buy any of this shit.
[1624.29s -> 1626.59s]  What do you got?
[1626.59s -> 1627.15s]  What's wrong with you?
[1630.43s -> 1630.59s]  Okay.
[1630.59s -> 1630.67s]  Yeah.
[1630.67s -> 1631.87s]  If you don't know what an ETF is.
[1631.87s -> 1633.07s]  So an ETF is...
[1633.63s -> 1635.79s]  And it's called an exchange traded fund.
[1635.79s -> 1641.98s]  What an ETF is, it's essentially like a big kind of colony of stocks in one ticker.
[1641.98s -> 1647.82s]  So it rises and falls based on the performance of the stuff that the ETF owns.
[1647.82s -> 1650.24s]  So let's say you talk about the S&P 500, right?
[1650.24s -> 1650.88s]  The SPY.
[1651.76s -> 1658.32s]  That's the weighted index of the top 500 companies in the United States by market value.
[1659.84s -> 1660.48s]  I'm smart.
[1660.48s -> 1661.12s]  I'm smart.
[1661.12s -> 1661.68s]  I'm smart.
[1661.68s -> 1662.64s]  I know what I'm talking about.
[1663.28s -> 1663.52s]  Okay.
[1664.32s -> 1672.50s]  So what that's saying is it's just like...
[1672.50s -> 1674.66s]  It's taking the average of all the hearts, essentially.
[1674.66s -> 1675.30s]  You are wrong.
[1675.30s -> 1675.94s]  I'm smart.
[1675.94s -> 1676.58s]  You're wrong.
[1676.58s -> 1677.14s]  I'm smart.
[1677.14s -> 1677.70s]  You're wrong.
[1680.62s -> 1681.26s]  Excuse me.
[1683.26s -> 1686.86s]  This guy right here lost a substantial amount of money
[1686.86s -> 1688.78s]  betting against Beyond Meat a few years ago.
[1689.34s -> 1690.86s]  I mean, I think I know what I'm talking about.
[1696.74s -> 1704.86s]  Anyways, I don't like Jerma when he talks about smart stuff.
[1704.86s -> 1707.82s]  No, I'm supposed to be just an idiot, right?
[1707.82s -> 1708.78s]  I'm just a dumb guy.
[1708.78s -> 1709.90s]  I didn't know anything.
[1709.90s -> 1710.94s]  I don't even know how to drive.
[1711.66s -> 1716.03s]  I don't even know what state I'm in.
[1716.75s -> 1717.95s]  I'm dumb idiot guy.
[1718.59s -> 1723.01s]  I did clog the toilet today, though.
[1723.57s -> 1724.69s]  And that was embarrassing.
[1725.41s -> 1727.90s]  And he's like, I did too, whatever.
[1731.73s -> 1732.93s]  I am pretty dumb, don't worry.
[1733.49s -> 1736.51s]  And I'm smart where it counts.
[1737.15s -> 1738.37s]  Okay.
[1738.37s -> 1740.96s]  You go ahead and read your books.
[1740.96s -> 1744.48s]  And you go ahead and read your books and get your A pluses.
[1744.48s -> 1745.36s]  I don't care.
[1745.36s -> 1746.32s]  I'm smart where it counts.
[1747.04s -> 1750.35s]  I haven't read a book in 10 years.
[1750.35s -> 1751.63s]  That's how you know I'm smart.
[1751.63s -> 1752.67s]  Okay, I'm fucking done.
[1753.23s -> 1753.79s]  Let's go.
[1761.73s -> 1762.69s]  Market open request.
[1764.61s -> 1765.89s]  Nerve clusters.
[1765.89s -> 1767.86s]  Okay, nerve clusters.
[1767.86s -> 1768.74s]  I don't care how...
[1768.74s -> 1769.24s]  All right.
[1770.42s -> 1771.70s]  This is dog shit.
[1771.70s -> 1772.10s]  I'm not...
[1772.10s -> 1773.62s]  They're on 9,300.
[1773.62s -> 1774.12s]  What do you want?
[1775.94s -> 1776.34s]  What is it?
[1776.34s -> 1777.62s]  I need something for an old trick of the trade.
[1777.62s -> 1780.42s]  If you run out of disinfectant, you can drip rock...
[1780.50s -> 1782.18s]  Rot cane juice into a wound?
[1782.90s -> 1784.03s]  What does he want?
[1785.09s -> 1786.29s]  I don't really want to know what you want.
[1786.29s -> 1787.01s]  What do you want?
[1787.01s -> 1788.45s]  This is x6 bladder.
[1790.16s -> 1790.80s]  How do I do it?
[1790.80s -> 1793.22s]  Bladder and liver.
[1793.22s -> 1794.02s]  Bladder and liver.
[1794.02s -> 1796.56s]  You dick.
[1796.56s -> 1797.20s]  Bladder and liver.
[1797.20s -> 1798.00s]  Got it.
[1798.00s -> 1800.05s]  Does a bladder look like?
[1800.05s -> 1804.29s]  This is x6 shit right here.
[1804.93s -> 1806.24s]  Is it not?
[1806.24s -> 1807.12s]  Does it say x6?
[1808.38s -> 1808.86s]  Is it not?
[1811.26s -> 1811.98s]  What does he want?
[1811.98s -> 1813.98s]  Two nerve clusters.
[1814.62s -> 1817.82s]  Do I have enough?
[1817.82s -> 1820.43s]  I need one more.
[1824.82s -> 1826.26s]  9,300 bucks.
[1826.26s -> 1827.30s]  What is this?
[1827.30s -> 1828.26s]  I don't understand this rot...
[1828.26s -> 1829.38s]  It means you have six days.
[1829.38s -> 1830.74s]  Oh, I thought it was x6.
[1834.50s -> 1836.18s]  Run out of disinfectant.
[1836.18s -> 1837.06s]  Cut and solder.
[1837.94s -> 1839.87s]  I don't even know what this is.
[1843.66s -> 1844.46s]  Rare lungs.
[1846.51s -> 1847.39s]  Rot cane?
[1847.39s -> 1848.43s]  Is it something I have to buy?
[1849.23s -> 1855.04s]  Okay, you want a liver.
[1855.04s -> 1855.68s]  I don't think I...
[1855.68s -> 1856.64s]  No, fuck that.
[1857.73s -> 1860.05s]  He wants the juice from what though?
[1864.16s -> 1866.08s]  What does rot cane juice come from?
[1872.22s -> 1873.18s]  Get rot cane.
[1874.77s -> 1877.81s]  Pipe, eyeball, size, common, soul.
[1878.53s -> 1880.13s]  It's the rot cane.
[1880.13s -> 1881.57s]  What is a rot cane?
[1881.57s -> 1882.93s]  I feel like you guys are making up a word
[1882.93s -> 1886.61s]  and I'm going to say like I like balls or something, right?
[1886.61s -> 1887.49s]  Like lick my balls.
[1888.93s -> 1890.56s]  It's the DNA logo?
[1891.12s -> 1894.05s]  I'm buying this bladder.
[1894.05s -> 1895.22s]  I'm going to hold it tomorrow.
[1895.86s -> 1901.12s]  I don't understand where it is.
[1901.12s -> 1901.92s]  I don't see anything.
[1902.48s -> 1912.69s]  Oh, it's closed.
[1912.69s -> 1914.66s]  Rot cane is a fluid found in...
[1916.90s -> 1918.02s]  Watch out for eyes.
[1918.90s -> 1922.14s]  It's the organ next to the heart.
[1922.14s -> 1923.58s]  I've never heard of a rot cane.
[1929.25s -> 1930.05s]  How's everything doing?
[1932.54s -> 1933.26s]  Rot cane.
[1933.26s -> 1933.58s]  All right.
[1933.58s -> 1934.78s]  Is there a rot cane index?
[1935.58s -> 1938.29s]  I should...
[1938.29s -> 1938.85s]  Holy shit, dude.
[1938.85s -> 1939.17s]  Look at this.
[1939.17s -> 1939.89s]  This is only $4?
[1940.69s -> 1942.18s]  This is cheapest shit.
[1942.74s -> 1945.94s]  I wonder about 100 of these.
[1945.94s -> 1948.82s]  That'd be 500?
[1949.54s -> 1949.78s]  Yeah.
[1951.26s -> 1951.74s]  Just watch.
[1952.38s -> 1953.58s]  This shit's going to go to like $1,000.
[1954.46s -> 1957.25s]  This is XCormix index.
[1957.89s -> 1960.32s]  We've got $2,000 in XCormix.
[1960.32s -> 1963.12s]  Just wait 10x in like five or six weeks.
[1963.12s -> 1964.61s]  This is really cheap.
[1965.17s -> 1967.70s]  Dude, this is too expensive.
[1974.14s -> 1974.94s]  Damn.
[1974.94s -> 1975.66s]  Buzzwimble.
[1976.38s -> 1977.26s]  Rot cane.
[1977.26s -> 1977.58s]  All right.
[1977.58s -> 1978.78s]  Well, what the fuck?
[1978.78s -> 1979.66s]  I can't even buy it.
[1984.72s -> 1985.04s]  All right.
[1985.60s -> 1986.32s]  Argo.
[1987.20s -> 1988.00s]  I have this bladder.
[1990.27s -> 1990.51s]  All right.
[1990.51s -> 1990.83s]  Let's go.
[1991.55s -> 1991.87s]  Bill.
[1992.51s -> 1994.13s]  I'm ready.
[1994.13s -> 1994.98s]  Let's go.
[1998.59s -> 1999.87s]  Give me a heart, please.
[1999.87s -> 2000.19s]  Heart.
[2001.23s -> 2002.11s]  You want...
[2002.11s -> 2003.47s]  This rot cane guy again.
[2003.47s -> 2004.19s]  But I don't...
[2004.19s -> 2005.15s]  It's not showing up anywhere.
[2006.24s -> 2006.64s]  Eyeball.
[2007.36s -> 2008.37s]  Fine.
[2008.37s -> 2009.49s]  I'll fulfill your dumb request.
[2010.21s -> 2012.02s]  Oh, I have too many.
[2012.74s -> 2013.62s]  All right.
[2013.62s -> 2014.34s]  You want eyeball.
[2015.31s -> 2015.79s]  And you want...
[2018.34s -> 2019.86s]  Heart, eyeball, rot cane.
[2021.81s -> 2022.05s]  Oh!
[2022.69s -> 2023.01s]  Got it.
[2024.93s -> 2025.33s]  And go.
[2028.19s -> 2030.35s]  Heart, rot cane, eyeball.
[2030.35s -> 2031.39s]  I need an eyeball.
[2031.39s -> 2034.18s]  What's with this market?
[2034.18s -> 2035.14s]  What's with this market?
[2035.14s -> 2035.78s]  There's nothing on here.
[2035.78s -> 2036.66s]  What's with this market?
[2036.66s -> 2037.14s]  I just bought...
[2037.14s -> 2038.10s]  I just didn't even want to buy that.
[2038.66s -> 2048.69s]  Okay.
[2048.69s -> 2049.33s]  Heart.
[2049.33s -> 2052.42s]  There's nothing for sale.
[2052.42s -> 2053.22s]  What's with this market?
[2054.88s -> 2055.20s]  All right.
[2057.30s -> 2058.18s]  Now I get why this...
[2058.18s -> 2059.70s]  You're supposed to do Q and E and shit.
[2060.74s -> 2062.48s]  Another rot cane?
[2063.36s -> 2064.99s]  Right here.
[2064.99s -> 2066.03s]  That's too expensive, though.
[2066.03s -> 2066.83s]  I want a cheaper one.
[2067.55s -> 2071.28s]  Give me a cheaper rot cane.
[2071.28s -> 2071.92s]  That's...
[2071.92s -> 2072.56s]  What the fuck?
[2072.56s -> 2073.60s]  $7,500?
[2074.48s -> 2077.25s]  That's way too much.
[2077.81s -> 2079.73s]  $7,500.
[2079.73s -> 2080.29s]  Get out of here.
[2081.01s -> 2083.49s]  I get $4,000.
[2083.49s -> 2083.65s]  No.
[2084.77s -> 2085.73s]  Dogshit return.
[2085.73s -> 2085.97s]  I won't...
[2085.97s -> 2086.37s]  There we go.
[2087.25s -> 2088.61s]  Remember the guy that just told me to wait?
[2088.61s -> 2090.05s]  Remember the guy that told me just to do it?
[2090.05s -> 2090.37s]  Yeah.
[2090.37s -> 2091.49s]  That's a 10x return now.
[2092.29s -> 2095.97s]  I'm gonna buy...
[2097.09s -> 2097.41s]  Okay.
[2097.41s -> 2098.21s]  All right.
[2098.21s -> 2101.79s]  I wonder if I should get something else, too.
[2102.59s -> 2105.54s]  If I see a rot cane for under $2,000, I'm getting it.
[2106.18s -> 2106.83s]  There it is.
[2107.39s -> 2111.15s]  I'm buying up all the rot canes.
[2111.79s -> 2114.11s]  Another one.
[2114.11s -> 2114.51s]  Give me it.
[2115.07s -> 2117.39s]  Another one.
[2117.39s -> 2117.71s]  Give me it.
[2118.27s -> 2120.06s]  Give me it.
[2120.62s -> 2121.73s]  Oh, what...
[2122.21s -> 2124.78s]  What's going on here?
[2124.78s -> 2127.60s]  Why is this blocked out?
[2127.60s -> 2128.16s]  Repair?
[2131.20s -> 2133.60s]  I could have just bought that fucking $1,000.
[2134.78s -> 2135.42s]  Wait, does that mean...
[2137.17s -> 2137.65s]  No.
[2137.65s -> 2138.29s]  Okay.
[2138.29s -> 2144.02s]  $800.
[2144.58s -> 2151.58s]  Oh, mark is over.
[2151.58s -> 2151.90s]  All right.
[2151.90s -> 2152.30s]  Not bad.
[2152.94s -> 2153.82s]  My portfolio...
[2153.82s -> 2154.86s]  Oh, what's this?
[2155.92s -> 2156.56s]  What's this?
[2157.82s -> 2158.62s]  Excuse me?
[2160.58s -> 2161.14s]  Where is it?
[2168.96s -> 2169.84s]  Um...
[2169.84s -> 2170.56s]  Excuse me?
[2173.20s -> 2173.76s]  Oh.
[2173.76s -> 2176.94s]  It didn't move.
[2176.94s -> 2177.66s]  Well, look at...
[2177.66s -> 2178.46s]  It says my thing.
[2178.46s -> 2179.74s]  My portfolio went up a good high.
[2180.96s -> 2182.16s]  Rot cane is bad for you.
[2182.16s -> 2182.48s]  Hull.
[2184.13s -> 2184.45s]  It is?
[2186.86s -> 2189.02s]  Corrosive destroys unprotected hulls.
[2191.04s -> 2191.68s]  Oh, shit.
[2192.24s -> 2197.15s]  Wait, what about this?
[2201.15s -> 2202.27s]  Man, this is sick.
[2202.27s -> 2202.75s]  Okay, there's...
[2202.75s -> 2202.99s]  All right.
[2202.99s -> 2203.63s]  There's upgrades.
[2206.26s -> 2208.18s]  Slows to the K of all organs by 25%.
[2209.46s -> 2209.94s]  I don't...
[2209.94s -> 2210.90s]  I don't want to go broke.
[2210.90s -> 2211.78s]  I'll do it tomorrow.
[2215.55s -> 2215.79s]  Oh.
[2216.35s -> 2219.50s]  What do you want?
[2220.77s -> 2221.17s]  Zero?
[2221.81s -> 2222.85s]  I'll talk.
[2222.85s -> 2223.81s]  I'll burn your life down.
[2223.81s -> 2225.57s]  So you owe me a mythic lung.
[2225.57s -> 2226.85s]  And I'm not paying shit.
[2228.74s -> 2231.22s]  I knew who you are before the fancy office.
[2231.22s -> 2231.38s]  What?
[2232.02s -> 2234.53s]  Did I just tell him to fuck off?
[2235.17s -> 2240.40s]  You exist on my mercy.
[2240.40s -> 2240.64s]  What...
[2241.68s -> 2241.92s]  Okay.
[2243.20s -> 2245.04s]  Urgent opportunity.
[2245.04s -> 2246.24s]  Everyone deserves to have organs,
[2246.24s -> 2247.92s]  but the powers that be benefit fighting each other.
[2248.48s -> 2249.20s]  I want a liver.
[2250.16s -> 2250.40s]  No.
[2252.90s -> 2253.14s]  All right.
[2253.14s -> 2253.62s]  I want...
[2256.62s -> 2258.06s]  First segment of the organ barcode
[2258.06s -> 2259.66s]  is the organ's market number.
[2259.66s -> 2259.98s]  Wait.
[2261.49s -> 2263.09s]  Heart is zero zero.
[2263.97s -> 2265.81s]  Know the number and you know the item.
[2268.18s -> 2269.78s]  Oh, so I don't have to...
[2269.78s -> 2270.10s]  Okay.
[2272.27s -> 2273.87s]  Heart is zero zero.
[2274.51s -> 2275.55s]  I can just memorize these.
[2276.19s -> 2277.39s]  So double zero is heart.
[2279.81s -> 2280.05s]  All right.
[2282.05s -> 2282.77s]  I need eyeball.
[2284.13s -> 2285.89s]  Eyeball heart.
[2287.50s -> 2289.10s]  No, this is all too cheap.
[2289.10s -> 2290.70s]  Do I fulfill this like this guy?
[2291.34s -> 2291.98s]  Trade already.
[2291.98s -> 2292.86s]  I'm going for it.
[2294.22s -> 2294.78s]  Oh, okay.
[2294.78s -> 2295.42s]  That's heart.
[2295.42s -> 2296.38s]  I see what they're doing.
[2297.10s -> 2299.17s]  So I can know exactly...
[2299.17s -> 2300.21s]  I don't even look at the icon.
[2303.02s -> 2303.26s]  Wait.
[2303.90s -> 2308.61s]  I gotta get rid of this shit.
[2309.17s -> 2310.86s]  I'll keep one.
[2311.42s -> 2314.03s]  Okay.
[2314.03s -> 2314.59s]  Hold on.
[2314.59s -> 2315.87s]  Does anybody want a rock cane?
[2320.42s -> 2321.22s]  What do you want?
[2321.22s -> 2321.54s]  Fuck.
[2321.54s -> 2323.30s]  I'm getting distracted.
[2323.30s -> 2323.78s]  What do you want?
[2325.01s -> 2325.33s]  You want...
[2327.01s -> 2328.21s]  Heart and eyeball.
[2328.77s -> 2330.86s]  How much you want to pay?
[2330.86s -> 2331.82s]  That's too stressful.
[2331.82s -> 2332.54s]  All right.
[2332.54s -> 2333.58s]  Heart for under a thousand.
[2335.87s -> 2336.27s]  Eyeball.
[2336.27s -> 2338.02s]  Buy it.
[2338.02s -> 2340.10s]  Heart for under a thousand.
[2340.10s -> 2341.86s]  Double zero, double zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[2341.86s -> 2342.58s]  Right here.
[2342.58s -> 2342.90s]  Got it.
[2343.46s -> 2350.66s]  Anybody else have a request?
[2352.02s -> 2352.42s]  Stomach.
[2353.06s -> 2353.54s]  You got it.
[2354.02s -> 2357.09s]  Stomach for how much?
[2357.65s -> 2358.90s]  168.
[2358.90s -> 2359.94s]  Get out of here.
[2359.94s -> 2363.20s]  Stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach for under a hundred.
[2363.92s -> 2364.72s]  Stomach for under a hundred.
[2365.36s -> 2368.43s]  Stomach for under a hundred.
[2369.07s -> 2371.47s]  Rock cane.
[2372.48s -> 2373.12s]  No.
[2373.12s -> 2373.44s]  Get it.
[2373.44s -> 2373.68s]  Sell it.
[2373.68s -> 2374.16s]  I don't want it.
[2374.64s -> 2377.47s]  Stomach for under a hundred.
[2378.11s -> 2380.30s]  Stomach for under a hundred.
[2382.74s -> 2383.62s]  Dude, I'm sorry.
[2383.62s -> 2384.66s]  I can't fulfill your request.
[2385.22s -> 2387.22s]  What does this guy want?
[2388.37s -> 2389.17s]  Mythic lung.
[2389.17s -> 2389.41s]  All right.
[2389.41s -> 2390.05s]  Well, I didn't do it.
[2391.62s -> 2392.82s]  Explain calls and puts.
[2393.86s -> 2394.50s]  No.
[2394.50s -> 2395.30s]  No, I don't think so.
[2403.14s -> 2404.50s]  This person is going to burn my life down.
[2404.50s -> 2405.22s]  Why?
[2405.22s -> 2408.56s]  How does this game work?
[2408.56s -> 2409.60s]  I'm walking my dog.
[2409.60s -> 2410.00s]  It's fun.
[2413.26s -> 2413.58s]  All right.
[2414.14s -> 2418.06s]  All right.
[2418.06s -> 2418.62s]  30 grand.
[2421.58s -> 2423.34s]  Oh, we have some more competition here.
[2423.90s -> 2425.68s]  Woohoo Charlie.
[2427.49s -> 2428.77s]  Liver, bladders, and kidneys.
[2429.41s -> 2434.14s]  Disgraced prince from a distant star.
[2435.07s -> 2438.83s]  Topping up on delightful necessities to keep the party going.
[2438.83s -> 2442.83s]  White emperor gold star.
[2442.83s -> 2445.55s]  Wants rare organs and mythical organs.
[2445.55s -> 2448.37s]  And I have it daddy personified.
[2448.37s -> 2449.65s]  The answer is always yes.
[2449.65s -> 2450.53s]  Just the worst.
[2453.01s -> 2458.96s]  If they're going to buy the expensive stuff though,
[2458.96s -> 2464.90s]  should I get favor with the rich emperor kid?
[2464.90s -> 2469.58s]  I feel like I might get some gifts.
[2469.58s -> 2475.58s]  So favor is...
[2475.58s -> 2476.86s]  Okay, I got money.
[2476.86s -> 2481.84s]  You're still brains, hearts, and lungs and you want rare stuff.
[2481.92s -> 2487.63s]  Yellow requests are unique.
[2487.63s -> 2488.27s]  Really?
[2488.27s -> 2490.26s]  So woohoo Charlie is cool?
[2490.26s -> 2494.62s]  Wants livers, bladders, and kidneys.
[2494.62s -> 2499.89s]  I mean, should I get a bunch of favor?
[2499.89s -> 2504.22s]  I'm going to try it.
[2504.22s -> 2504.94s]  I got money.
[2504.94s -> 2506.50s]  See what happens.
[2506.50s -> 2510.10s]  The requests, not the traders.
[2510.10s -> 2513.39s]  Oh, okay.
[2513.39s -> 2513.87s]  I'm going to pay.
[2513.87s -> 2514.35s]  I'm going to...
[2514.35s -> 2515.23s]  Okay, here we go.
[2515.23s -> 2521.41s]  What does that do?
[2521.41s -> 2530.00s]  Did I just give the rich kid 10 grand for no reason?
[2530.00s -> 2536.70s]  Why did I do that?
[2536.70s -> 2538.46s]  Do the yellow requests.
[2538.46s -> 2539.18s]  Okay.
[2539.18s -> 2550.26s]  He's a top 100 streamer like you.
[2553.89s -> 2557.46s]  Scammed yourself.
[2557.46s -> 2558.98s]  You gave them gift subs.
[2562.34s -> 2562.74s]  All right.
[2562.74s -> 2564.26s]  What should I do with this?
[2564.26s -> 2566.98s]  I bought it for $216,000 and I lost money on it.
[2566.98s -> 2568.58s]  But market, market, market.
[2568.58s -> 2570.94s]  This didn't move.
[2571.58s -> 2573.98s]  You know what?
[2573.98s -> 2575.58s]  We're doubling down then.
[2575.58s -> 2579.58s]  I'm doubling down on the XCormix.
[2579.58s -> 2584.77s]  We're tripling down on the XCormix.
[2584.77s -> 2588.88s]  I want 10 grand in XCormix.
[2588.88s -> 2589.36s]  Just wait.
[2589.36s -> 2589.76s]  It's going to be...
[2589.76s -> 2591.20s]  This could be a shortage or something.
[2591.20s -> 2592.00s]  Trust me.
[2592.00s -> 2594.34s]  All right.
[2594.34s -> 2595.30s]  I still have this guy thing.
[2595.30s -> 2596.10s]  I have to fulfill this.
[2596.10s -> 2596.98s]  Let's go.
[2596.98s -> 2600.69s]  This person's still here.
[2601.33s -> 2601.57s]  All right.
[2601.57s -> 2601.97s]  If I...
[2601.97s -> 2606.11s]  No, I have five days to do this one.
[2606.11s -> 2608.40s]  Need another eyeball.
[2608.40s -> 2609.44s]  Six days to get an eyeball.
[2610.77s -> 2615.81s]  Bladder, eye, bladder, eye, bladder, liver.
[2615.81s -> 2618.83s]  Eye, bladder, liver for cheap.
[2618.83s -> 2622.93s]  Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.
[2622.93s -> 2624.53s]  Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.
[2624.53s -> 2626.29s]  Eye, bladder, liver, stomach.
[2626.29s -> 2627.62s]  I already have one.
[2628.67s -> 2628.99s]  I don't.
[2628.99s -> 2629.39s]  Yeah, I do.
[2629.39s -> 2629.89s]  Here.
[2630.59s -> 2633.39s]  Eye, bladder, stomach eye.
[2633.39s -> 2635.71s]  Stomach eye for less than 200.
[2635.71s -> 2636.98s]  Stomach eye.
[2636.98s -> 2637.30s]  Bingo.
[2637.30s -> 2637.94s]  Got it.
[2637.94s -> 2639.46s]  Did I get it?
[2639.46s -> 2642.56s]  Oh, that piece of shit.
[2642.56s -> 2643.36s]  Bladder.
[2643.36s -> 2643.86s]  Got it.
[2644.24s -> 2644.56s]  Fuck.
[2644.56s -> 2644.96s]  I have to...
[2644.96s -> 2645.20s]  I can't...
[2645.20s -> 2646.08s]  I'm too slow.
[2646.08s -> 2649.15s]  I'm never gonna make the raid.
[2649.15s -> 2650.51s]  My DPS is gonna be too low
[2650.51s -> 2652.27s]  because I'm in competition with these idiots.
[2652.27s -> 2653.73s]  Did I get it?
[2653.73s -> 2654.13s]  I didn't...
[2654.13s -> 2654.77s]  What did I buy?
[2655.41s -> 2655.97s]  What do you want?
[2661.20s -> 2664.32s]  You want eyeball and a stomach.
[2667.22s -> 2667.46s]  No.
[2668.02s -> 2668.42s]  Stop it.
[2668.42s -> 2668.90s]  Give me that.
[2669.62s -> 2671.10s]  Eyeball.
[2676.42s -> 2676.98s]  There we go.
[2676.98s -> 2677.54s]  Oh my god.
[2677.54s -> 2678.82s]  I have to compete with these idiots.
[2679.38s -> 2683.70s]  This one's valuable.
[2684.26s -> 2687.09s]  My DPS is too low.
[2687.73s -> 2689.71s]  The second segment of an organ barcode
[2689.71s -> 2690.83s]  is the organ size.
[2691.63s -> 2693.06s]  D is tiny.
[2693.06s -> 2693.94s]  C is small.
[2693.94s -> 2694.66s]  B is average.
[2694.66s -> 2695.38s]  A is large.
[2695.38s -> 2696.34s]  S is gigantic.
[2696.34s -> 2697.78s]  Oh god damn it.
[2697.78s -> 2698.10s]  Okay.
[2699.22s -> 2701.70s]  So zero A is a huge heart.
[2702.34s -> 2704.02s]  Zero S is a gigantic...
[2704.02s -> 2704.42s]  No.
[2704.42s -> 2705.06s]  Zero zero.
[2706.46s -> 2709.02s]  Zero zero S is big.
[2709.02s -> 2709.66s]  Zero zero.
[2709.66s -> 2709.82s]  Okay.
[2709.82s -> 2710.94s]  So it's just grades.
[2711.50s -> 2713.89s]  This is the size of the organ.
[2714.61s -> 2717.84s]  So for instance, if we go to the hearts,
[2717.84s -> 2719.20s]  this is zero zero D.
[2719.20s -> 2720.24s]  Zero zero heart.
[2721.65s -> 2722.53s]  It's very small.
[2722.53s -> 2723.89s]  This is a huge heart right here.
[2723.89s -> 2724.77s]  You know what I mean?
[2724.77s -> 2726.66s]  I think I need to drink a little
[2726.66s -> 2727.78s]  fucking cup of coffee for this one.
[2728.42s -> 2735.04s]  There's a B.
[2735.04s -> 2735.36s]  Got it.
[2736.08s -> 2737.20s]  That one was a pretty good one.
[2738.19s -> 2739.07s]  There's a B.
[2739.07s -> 2739.47s]  I guess.
[2739.47s -> 2739.87s]  I don't know.
[2739.87s -> 2740.35s]  Should I have it?
[2740.91s -> 2742.03s]  What do you want?
[2742.67s -> 2743.55s]  Liver.
[2743.55s -> 2745.95s]  What does a liver look like?
[2751.38s -> 2751.70s]  Kidney?
[2754.37s -> 2754.93s]  Stomach?
[2754.93s -> 2755.57s]  What is a liver?
[2758.50s -> 2759.54s]  Devs tweeted about you.
[2760.66s -> 2763.01s]  Oh, look at me.
[2763.01s -> 2763.65s]  What is a liver?
[2764.29s -> 2768.26s]  You guys know how big your liver actually is.
[2768.90s -> 2770.61s]  How much are you going to pay me?
[2770.61s -> 2771.49s]  I don't think that's worth it.
[2772.13s -> 2775.89s]  Oh.
[2775.89s -> 2776.29s]  All right.
[2779.79s -> 2781.47s]  Oh, 20%.
[2782.91s -> 2786.67s]  There it is.
[2786.67s -> 2787.79s]  Two grand in the bank.
[2787.79s -> 2788.83s]  I'm not selling it.
[2788.83s -> 2789.79s]  I'm not selling it to at least,
[2789.79s -> 2791.15s]  it's at least a thousand.
[2791.15s -> 2796.62s]  All right.
[2796.62s -> 2797.58s]  These are pretty valuable.
[2797.58s -> 2799.42s]  Common, common mythic.
[2799.42s -> 2800.14s]  I have a mythic eye.
[2801.02s -> 2804.30s]  Zero two is liver.
[2804.30s -> 2804.94s]  Okay.
[2804.94s -> 2808.03s]  Oh, I'm going to have to memorize this.
[2808.03s -> 2809.47s]  Aren't I going to be this thing
[2809.47s -> 2810.35s]  turned to papers, please.
[2810.35s -> 2810.67s]  Isn't it?
[2813.50s -> 2814.38s]  Stop losing value.
[2815.02s -> 2819.33s]  I buy some more.
[2820.05s -> 2821.17s]  Anything else like crash?
[2827.28s -> 2827.68s]  Nothing.
[2827.68s -> 2829.12s]  Everything seems doing okay.
[2829.12s -> 2835.89s]  Yeah, my stock went up.
[2835.89s -> 2836.61s]  Oh, yeah.
[2836.61s -> 2839.30s]  I'm not selling it.
[2843.41s -> 2845.01s]  You still need a liver.
[2845.01s -> 2845.89s]  Liver is zero two.
[2845.89s -> 2846.37s]  You said, okay.
[2846.37s -> 2847.17s]  Let's go.
[2847.17s -> 2850.18s]  This guy's back again.
[2851.78s -> 2857.87s]  Dude, like, oh, soul.
[2859.39s -> 2860.03s]  And I'm tired.
[2860.03s -> 2861.63s]  You want just, I want a soul.
[2862.67s -> 2865.06s]  Soul, nerve cluster.
[2867.25s -> 2869.97s]  Soul, nerve cluster, and heart.
[2871.65s -> 2873.57s]  Soul, nerve cluster, and heart.
[2873.57s -> 2875.49s]  Soul, nerve cluster, heart.
[2875.49s -> 2876.77s]  Soul, nerve, soul.
[2876.77s -> 2879.42s]  That's two, got it.
[2879.42s -> 2880.62s]  Fuck off, buddy.
[2880.62s -> 2881.02s]  Liver.
[2881.92s -> 2882.40s]  Wait, what?
[2883.20s -> 2883.92s]  What is all this shit?
[2883.92s -> 2885.04s]  Why do I have all these bladders?
[2885.76s -> 2889.86s]  I snipe that guy so bad.
[2890.74s -> 2892.51s]  All right.
[2893.39s -> 2895.31s]  Liver and I got new organs.
[2898.56s -> 2904.03s]  Liver and liver and wait.
[2904.03s -> 2907.17s]  The third segment of an organ barcode
[2907.17s -> 2908.29s]  is the organ's condition.
[2908.29s -> 2911.65s]  If the barcode is the condition is 60.
[2912.53s -> 2913.98s]  God.
[2915.10s -> 2920.77s]  So it goes organ type, size, condition.
[2922.67s -> 2925.94s]  Organ type, size, condition.
[2927.98s -> 2930.30s]  This is too much for my fucking pea brain.
[2931.10s -> 2932.62s]  Oh, this 9100.
[2933.26s -> 2934.30s]  Rot cane, got it.
[2935.82s -> 2936.62s]  Not a scam.
[2937.26s -> 2938.14s]  This is a scam.
[2938.14s -> 2938.62s]  I lie.
[2938.62s -> 2939.82s]  Do not send me a heart.
[2939.82s -> 2942.30s]  I cannot make amends for this failure of conscience.
[2942.30s -> 2943.18s]  But I am so sorry.
[2943.18s -> 2944.46s]  I deserve nothing in this world.
[2944.46s -> 2944.78s]  Goodbye.
[2944.78s -> 2945.34s]  I'll get it for you.
[2946.06s -> 2946.62s]  You want a heart?
[2947.42s -> 2950.16s]  Here.
[2951.28s -> 2954.30s]  Okay.
[2954.30s -> 2958.64s]  Now I need rot cane, nerve, liver.
[2959.28s -> 2960.94s]  No way.
[2961.58s -> 2962.86s]  Rot cane, nerve, liver, nerve.
[2963.58s -> 2967.18s]  Rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane.
[2967.18s -> 2967.66s]  Nerve.
[2967.66s -> 2968.22s]  That's too much.
[2968.94s -> 2971.65s]  Come on.
[2972.21s -> 2974.45s]  I'll buy that stomach and I'll buy that eye.
[2976.11s -> 2977.23s]  All bladder.
[2977.23s -> 2978.26s]  Okay.
[2978.26s -> 2978.66s]  Nerve.
[2979.30s -> 2980.74s]  I need a nerve.
[2981.46s -> 2982.34s]  Rot cane, nerve.
[2983.81s -> 2984.85s]  Stop buying shit.
[2984.85s -> 2986.53s]  We need more stuff on the market.
[2987.17s -> 2988.05s]  You idiot.
[2988.05s -> 2988.61s]  I'll buy that.
[2988.61s -> 2989.25s]  I'll buy that too.
[2989.97s -> 2992.75s]  How much are you gonna give me for the nerve?
[2995.20s -> 2995.92s]  Oh, buy it.
[3000.00s -> 3000.48s]  Eat shit.
[3000.48s -> 3006.08s]  I got it.
[3006.08s -> 3007.20s]  Oh my God.
[3007.20s -> 3009.36s]  Why do I have so many of these?
[3010.24s -> 3014.61s]  What do you guys need?
[3014.61s -> 3014.93s]  All right.
[3014.93s -> 3016.93s]  You want a nerve cluster for $3,200.
[3019.01s -> 3019.33s]  Oh.
[3025.65s -> 3026.29s]  All right.
[3026.29s -> 3026.93s]  That was a good day.
[3027.49s -> 3030.48s]  Still, I got 12 grand over here still.
[3030.48s -> 3031.36s]  I'm fine.
[3031.36s -> 3037.73s]  Maybe I should upgrade my, um...
[3038.37s -> 3039.55s]  Should I sell some stock?
[3040.19s -> 3040.75s]  Nah.
[3040.75s -> 3041.47s]  No.
[3041.47s -> 3045.57s]  Hey, a real-life Devon chat here.
[3045.57s -> 3047.97s]  I hacked Kinect support into this game before it launched.
[3047.97s -> 3050.21s]  This is not a bit, though it is objectively funny.
[3050.21s -> 3052.93s]  If you plug in a Kinect on PC and step in front of it, it'll work.
[3053.97s -> 3054.29s]  What?
[3055.62s -> 3056.42s]  What are you talking?
[3056.42s -> 3056.74s]  Why?
[3059.30s -> 3060.50s]  Why would you do that?
[3063.63s -> 3064.91s]  I don't think that makes any sense.
[3065.79s -> 3068.59s]  I need to get the Kinect drivers for the computer.
[3068.59s -> 3069.63s]  I don't think that makes any sense.
[3070.51s -> 3072.83s]  It's because it was funny.
[3075.73s -> 3076.53s]  I don't...
[3076.53s -> 3077.89s]  I don't even know where my Kinect is.
[3078.85s -> 3082.38s]  I don't know.
[3082.38s -> 3084.70s]  I have a feeling I'm gonna plug that in and the Kinect's gonna turn on.
[3084.70s -> 3086.46s]  It's gonna take a bunch of pictures of me sitting here naked.
[3087.02s -> 3088.06s]  I don't know if I want to do that.
[3094.46s -> 3095.10s]  Don't find it.
[3095.66s -> 3096.30s]  Maybe later.
[3096.86s -> 3097.92s]  I'm trading.
[3097.92s -> 3098.40s]  I'm trading.
[3098.40s -> 3099.44s]  I'm wheeling and dealing here.
[3099.44s -> 3099.92s]  Give me a minute.
[3101.36s -> 3102.24s]  Just do it.
[3102.24s -> 3104.14s]  I feel...
[3104.78s -> 3106.14s]  What if it crashes my stream?
[3108.67s -> 3108.91s]  All right.
[3108.91s -> 3109.31s]  Hold on.
[3109.55s -> 3110.11s]  Let me...
[3110.75s -> 3113.31s]  I have to put clothes on.
[3114.19s -> 3115.23s]  Does it take pictures of you?
[3116.03s -> 3118.27s]  I'm so concerned about this for no reason.
[3118.27s -> 3119.58s]  All right.
[3119.58s -> 3121.26s]  This guy's Messy Marcus.
[3121.26s -> 3122.14s]  He doesn't have any goals.
[3122.70s -> 3125.18s]  A panicking, anxious, desperate wreck.
[3125.18s -> 3126.78s]  If they could escape themselves, they would.
[3127.50s -> 3129.09s]  Here.
[3129.09s -> 3130.53s]  Take $86 and fuck off.
[3133.70s -> 3135.54s]  Ipe Emperor Gold Star.
[3135.54s -> 3136.61s]  No.
[3136.61s -> 3143.38s]  Get dressed.
[3145.14s -> 3148.58s]  What if it crashed my stream with like the Spongebob text
[3148.58s -> 3150.42s]  leaning down doing like the Spongebob stance?
[3153.60s -> 3154.16s]  I'm trying...
[3154.16s -> 3155.44s]  Let me just get used to the game first.
[3155.44s -> 3156.80s]  It hasn't even been like 40 minutes.
[3160.67s -> 3162.11s]  It actually works.
[3162.11s -> 3164.19s]  I promise I will plug in my Kinect.
[3164.19s -> 3164.75s]  But not yet.
[3168.03s -> 3169.31s]  Is the Kinect USB?
[3169.31s -> 3170.03s]  God damn it.
[3176.00s -> 3176.32s]  All right.
[3177.04s -> 3177.92s]  I'm not holding anything.
[3177.92s -> 3179.36s]  Let's do trading day start.
[3179.36s -> 3179.76s]  Let's go.
[3183.36s -> 3183.52s]  Okay.
[3183.52s -> 3184.48s]  I like this guy.
[3184.48s -> 3186.94s]  Fratera Open Market sent me a heart.
[3186.94s -> 3190.34s]  I will compensate you over 20 times after it arrives.
[3190.34s -> 3190.98s]  Oh my God.
[3190.98s -> 3191.22s]  Okay.
[3191.22s -> 3191.46s]  Heart.
[3192.26s -> 3194.06s]  Eyeball.
[3194.94s -> 3198.11s]  Ah, naughty creature.
[3198.11s -> 3198.91s]  I know what you did.
[3198.91s -> 3199.79s]  If you do not want...
[3200.51s -> 3203.39s]  If you do not want everyone to know your big secret,
[3203.39s -> 3205.23s]  you'll send me a stomach via private...
[3205.23s -> 3205.71s]  All right.
[3205.71s -> 3206.03s]  Whatever.
[3207.15s -> 3209.36s]  What do we need here?
[3209.36s -> 3210.72s]  This guy is fucking weird.
[3211.44s -> 3211.92s]  Heart.
[3211.92s -> 3212.40s]  Eyeball.
[3213.20s -> 3213.52s]  Heart.
[3215.41s -> 3215.73s]  Nerve.
[3216.45s -> 3216.93s]  Eyeball.
[3216.93s -> 3217.25s]  Heart.
[3217.25s -> 3217.57s]  Nerve.
[3218.21s -> 3218.53s]  Liver.
[3219.62s -> 3220.42s]  Eyebar.
[3220.42s -> 3220.90s]  Eyeheart.
[3221.54s -> 3221.94s]  Eyeho...
[3225.94s -> 3226.90s]  Eyeheart radio.
[3228.34s -> 3229.22s]  What do I need?
[3229.22s -> 3229.94s]  An eyeball.
[3230.98s -> 3233.26s]  Eyeball.
[3233.26s -> 3233.58s]  Heart.
[3234.88s -> 3235.52s]  Eyeball.
[3235.52s -> 3236.16s]  I'm fucking...
[3236.16s -> 3236.96s]  I'm messed up.
[3236.96s -> 3237.36s]  Eyeball.
[3237.36s -> 3237.68s]  Heart.
[3238.40s -> 3241.18s]  Just one at a time.
[3241.18s -> 3241.58s]  I can't...
[3241.58s -> 3242.06s]  Too slow.
[3242.06s -> 3242.78s]  I'm too slow.
[3245.58s -> 3245.90s]  Nerve.
[3247.54s -> 3248.10s]  Nerve.
[3248.10s -> 3248.66s]  Eyeball.
[3249.22s -> 3249.54s]  Liver.
[3251.94s -> 3253.30s]  Why do I keep buying stomachs?
[3254.10s -> 3254.50s]  Eyeball.
[3255.38s -> 3255.70s]  Liver.
[3257.49s -> 3258.21s]  Liver.
[3258.21s -> 3258.77s]  Zero.
[3258.77s -> 3259.01s]  Two.
[3261.14s -> 3261.54s]  Zero.
[3262.10s -> 3262.58s]  Eyeball.
[3263.52s -> 3264.80s]  I don't need two.
[3264.80s -> 3265.36s]  Liver.
[3265.36s -> 3265.60s]  Step...
[3265.60s -> 3266.08s]  What do I need?
[3266.64s -> 3270.02s]  Okay.
[3270.02s -> 3273.01s]  Um, I made money on that shit.
[3274.54s -> 3276.22s]  Nerve cluster and liver.
[3276.78s -> 3280.02s]  Got it.
[3280.02s -> 3280.82s]  Liver.
[3280.82s -> 3283.57s]  What's that?
[3284.38s -> 3285.10s]  Shift walks.
[3285.74s -> 3286.80s]  I don't know what the hell that...
[3287.36s -> 3291.09s]  How is that not a liver?
[3291.65s -> 3293.47s]  It's a liver.
[3293.47s -> 3293.95s]  What do you want?
[3294.59s -> 3297.47s]  I just want...
[3297.47s -> 3297.95s]  Okay.
[3297.95s -> 3298.27s]  Request.
[3298.27s -> 3298.83s]  Who wants what?
[3298.83s -> 3299.39s]  Who wants what?
[3300.11s -> 3301.12s]  I got...
[3301.12s -> 3302.64s]  Give me a liver above 54.
[3302.64s -> 3303.04s]  You got it.
[3303.92s -> 3305.04s]  Uh, give me a stomach.
[3305.04s -> 3307.82s]  Sure.
[3307.82s -> 3308.38s]  Um, okay.
[3309.26s -> 3309.58s]  Liver.
[3310.30s -> 3312.14s]  This is liver.
[3313.30s -> 3314.82s]  54 liver.
[3314.82s -> 3315.54s]  Any liver.
[3315.54s -> 3317.06s]  54 liver, stomach, liver.
[3317.06s -> 3318.82s]  54 liver, stomach, liver.
[3318.82s -> 3320.66s]  54 liver, stomach, liver.

[3541.58s -> 3545.36s]  What is happening?
[3546.24s -> 3546.80s]  It's fun.

[3568.50s -> 3569.30s]  I need livers.
[3569.30s -> 3571.14s]  I have to get rid of the people that are buying livers.
[3587.22s -> 3592.38s]  Okay, apologize to the quartermaster now.
[3592.38s -> 3594.54s]  No, we're all rotten scumbags, okay?
[3595.26s -> 3596.06s]  Look what we're doing.
[3596.78s -> 3601.12s]  Such a weird image too.
[3601.12s -> 3603.36s]  Okay, so let me get this right.
[3604.00s -> 3604.96s]  I need a bunch of livers.
[3604.96s -> 3610.30s]  I think I need three livers and a kidney and one has to be above 54.

[3627.41s -> 3632.35s]  I need livers and one kidney.
[3632.99s -> 3634.59s]  This is way too much money.
[3638.78s -> 3640.70s]  No one's buying it so I can just sit there and depreciate.
[3640.70s -> 3641.10s]  I don't care.
[3644.13s -> 3645.09s]  There's one liver.
[3645.81s -> 3647.90s]  All right.
[3648.54s -> 3651.55s]  I need more than that.
[3652.19s -> 3654.88s]  Come on, man.
[3657.90s -> 3660.03s]  In the meantime, heart.

[3686.61s -> 3687.73s]  That's so expensive.
[3688.77s -> 3689.97s]  I'm going to lose money on this.
[3691.01s -> 3693.94s]  All right, take that.
[3694.98s -> 3697.38s]  Now we need a heart, liver, and a kidney.
[3698.18s -> 3699.97s]  Give me this.

[3710.40s -> 3712.35s]  There's a cloning lab.
[3712.35s -> 3714.59s]  They figured out how to make organs but they need materials.
[3714.59s -> 3717.79s]  I don't have much but please help me help the rest of us.
[3717.79s -> 3719.15s]  One average lung, please.

[5875.20s -> 5876.04s]  The devs tweet.
[5876.04s -> 5877.90s]  What's the Twitter?
[5877.90s -> 5885.92s]  I need to see it.
[5885.92s -> 5890.48s]  Time to see it.
[5890.48s -> 5896.72s]  What are they saying?
[5896.72s -> 5900.08s]  Come on.
[5900.08s -> 5901.24s]  The fact that this is too late
[5901.24s -> 5903.28s]  for Jerma's yearly award show is criminal.
[5903.28s -> 5905.40s]  This entire Kinect bit is usually best joke
[5905.40s -> 5907.36s]  that took over five minutes.
[5907.36s -> 5909.00s]  You've given this man a mental breakdown.
[5909.00s -> 5911.24s]  Is there actually no such thing
[5911.24s -> 5912.80s]  as Kinect support for this game?
[5912.80s -> 5917.39s]  Was that like a 20 minute, I just got had?
[5917.39s -> 5926.04s]  He found his Kinect.
[5926.04s -> 5928.56s]  It can't be real.
[5928.60s -> 5930.36s]  54 liver, stomach, liver.
[5930.36s -> 5932.00s]  I can't believe you've now made Jerma worry
[5932.00s -> 5934.16s]  about the Kinect taking pictures of him nude.
[5934.16s -> 5944.16s]  Ah, this is funny.
[5944.16s -> 5945.00s]  It's not real.
[5945.00s -> 5945.92s]  I don't believe it's real.
[5945.92s -> 5947.64s]  It can't be.
[5947.64s -> 5951.57s]  I can't plug that shit into my computer.
[5951.57s -> 5955.25s]  Kinect FAQ.
[5955.25s -> 5958.88s]  Wait, okay.
[5958.88s -> 5960.84s]  FAQ, yes, we support Kinect.
[5960.84s -> 5961.80s]  Does this game support Kinect?
[5961.80s -> 5963.44s]  Yes, on PC only.
[5963.44s -> 5965.20s]  If you plug in a Kinect 2.0 to your computer
[5965.20s -> 5966.04s]  while the game is open,
[5966.04s -> 5967.28s]  you can play through the entirety of the game
[5967.28s -> 5968.56s]  using Kinect controls.
[5968.56s -> 5970.24s]  Grab meat with your meat hands.
[5970.24s -> 5971.24s]  Your body is to control it.
[5971.24s -> 5972.08s]  We live in the future.
[5972.08s -> 5975.32s]  Good luck.
[5975.32s -> 5980.29s]  I guess I have the original like dog shit Kinect.
[5980.29s -> 5988.11s]  Thing that uses like an orange display port.
[5988.11s -> 5992.53s]  What are you linking me with?
[5992.53s -> 5995.61s]  Oh, it's somebody using it with the Kinect.
[5995.61s -> 5997.79s]  Are you kidding me?
[5997.79s -> 6000.73s]  Ah, this is fun.
[6000.73s -> 6001.57s]  This game's fun.
[6001.57s -> 6002.41s]  I like this game.
[6002.41s -> 6003.25s]  All right, let's go.
[6012.41s -> 6014.34s]  All right, let's move.
[6014.34s -> 6015.18s]  What do you want?
[6015.18s -> 6019.59s]  Heart, bladder.
[6019.59s -> 6020.67s]  I need a heart and a bladder.
[6020.67s -> 6022.55s]  So we have a heart and now we need a bladder.
[6022.75s -> 6026.72s]  Heart is more expensive than what he wants.
[6026.72s -> 6028.12s]  Okay, just need a bladder.
[6028.12s -> 6031.63s]  These are going up in value.
[6031.63s -> 6036.01s]  Again, what do I need?
[6036.01s -> 6037.93s]  Heart, I need a bladder.
[6037.93s -> 6039.29s]  No, not a gall bladder.
[6039.29s -> 6042.04s]  The dev is debating me.
[6042.04s -> 6042.88s]  What the fuck?
[6042.88s -> 6044.32s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6044.32s -> 6045.16s]  What the fuck?
[6045.16s -> 6047.08s]  I hit E instead of W.
[6047.08s -> 6048.76s]  No, heart is $180.
[6048.76s -> 6049.60s]  Are you kidding me?
[6049.60s -> 6052.32s]  That's cheap.
[6052.32s -> 6053.20s]  I gotta chill out.
[6053.20s -> 6056.25s]  Relax.
[6056.25s -> 6059.84s]  I need a bladder.
[6059.84s -> 6060.96s]  Get some more of these.
[6060.96s -> 6065.86s]  No, focus.
[6065.86s -> 6067.30s]  What the hell do you guys want?
[6067.34s -> 6069.10s]  Stomach in five days.
[6069.10s -> 6072.68s]  I want a heart and I want a nerve cluster.
[6072.68s -> 6073.92s]  Yeah, I got five days to do these.
[6073.92s -> 6075.96s]  Nerve cluster and stomach.
[6075.96s -> 6079.83s]  Stomach and shift works.
[6079.83s -> 6081.19s]  Oh my God, you idiot.
[6081.19s -> 6084.12s]  Just get rid of these stupid kidneys.
[6084.12s -> 6085.48s]  No, this one.
[6085.48s -> 6088.48s]  No, I wanted to find, no, dude.
[6088.48s -> 6090.99s]  What the hell?
[6090.99s -> 6093.55s]  Here.
[6093.55s -> 6095.88s]  I need a heart and a bladder.
[6095.88s -> 6107.42s]  I need a bladder now.
[6107.42s -> 6111.43s]  Bladder, now.
[6111.43s -> 6113.67s]  Oh my God, that was cheap.
[6114.39s -> 6115.51s]  Did you see this thing?
[6115.51s -> 6119.59s]  93 quality, small, blood type AB, mythic quality, $200.
[6119.59s -> 6122.70s]  This thing's worth at least a thousand.
[6122.70s -> 6125.78s]  All right, stop being like a fucking comedy guy.
[6125.78s -> 6132.00s]  Need a bladder, bladder.
[6132.00s -> 6132.96s]  I know I missed a bladder.
[6132.96s -> 6134.12s]  It's because people are faster than me
[6134.12s -> 6136.66s]  and I accidentally hit E instead of W.
[6136.66s -> 6140.49s]  Oh my goodness.
[6140.49s -> 6143.25s]  You want a fancy, what do you want?
[6143.25s -> 6146.74s]  All right, nerve cluster.
[6146.74s -> 6149.80s]  Ooh, bingo.
[6149.80s -> 6151.04s]  Two eyeballs for the price of one,
[6151.04s -> 6153.97s]  thanks to my last hunting trip, 400.
[6154.13s -> 6156.41s]  Get out of here, fuck off.
[6156.41s -> 6157.81s]  Little squirrely fella thought
[6157.81s -> 6159.81s]  they could hide their pancreas from me.
[6159.81s -> 6161.25s]  Made sure it's real high condition.
[6161.25s -> 6165.79s]  600 bucks, yeah, I'll take it.
[6165.79s -> 6166.63s]  That's pretty good.
[6166.63s -> 6168.15s]  That's pretty good quality, too.
[6168.15s -> 6171.97s]  Oh my freaking God.
[6171.97s -> 6173.09s]  Did I hold it?
[6173.09s -> 6179.00s]  No, sell it now.
[6179.00s -> 6183.17s]  Stomach and a shift wux.
[6183.17s -> 6184.13s]  I think I already have the stomach.
[6184.13s -> 6193.12s]  I do and I need a shift wux.
[6193.12s -> 6201.96s]  Shift wux, aw.
[6201.96s -> 6207.40s]  This is going up in value.
[6207.40s -> 6210.16s]  I just paid two grand on that trade.
[6210.16s -> 6211.56s]  Remember to please show your piss bottle.
[6211.56s -> 6218.75s]  I pee in the toilet like a human.
[6218.75s -> 6220.91s]  I have, okay.
[6220.91s -> 6224.47s]  What am I fulfilling here?
[6224.47s -> 6227.34s]  Let me do this one.
[6227.34s -> 6228.38s]  Mythic lung.
[6228.38s -> 6236.37s]  I need mythic lung and I need a shift wux.
[6236.37s -> 6237.29s]  Is that a shift wux?
[6237.29s -> 6240.64s]  Mythic, oh my God, I can't even read.
[6240.64s -> 6242.52s]  Mythic lung and a shift wux.
[6242.52s -> 6243.84s]  Got it, okay.
[6245.64s -> 6247.15s]  Thank you.
[6247.15s -> 6248.19s]  I need a mythic lung.
[6248.19s -> 6251.01s]  Let's take some more requests.
[6251.01s -> 6253.23s]  What's this one?
[6253.23s -> 6255.87s]  Rarity doesn't matter, get me a shard now.
[6255.87s -> 6260.68s]  Okay, you guys have terrible deals.
[6260.68s -> 6263.78s]  Need, what am I doing here?
[6263.78s -> 6268.14s]  Okay, shard, soul.
[6268.14s -> 6271.92s]  Shard, soul, mythic lung.
[6271.92s -> 6273.76s]  Shard, soul, mythic lung.
[6273.76s -> 6276.09s]  That's too expensive.
[6276.09s -> 6278.42s]  God, oh.
[6278.42s -> 6282.06s]  Mythic, the organ barge approaches.
[6282.06s -> 6283.62s]  Tomorrow ports across the galaxy
[6283.62s -> 6285.74s]  will drown in nerve clusters.
[6285.74s -> 6290.70s]  The market begins to whip itself into a frenzy.
[6290.70s -> 6295.20s]  Huh?
[6295.20s -> 6296.24s]  Huh?
[6296.24s -> 6302.94s]  Mythic lung.
[6302.94s -> 6307.29s]  Give me a lung, come on.
[6307.29s -> 6312.06s]  Mythic lung, mythic lung, what is this?
[6312.06s -> 6317.88s]  Mythic, nope.
[6317.88s -> 6319.31s]  I missed it?
[6319.31s -> 6320.15s]  No, I didn't.
[6320.15s -> 6323.27s]  This is rough.
[6323.27s -> 6328.84s]  It's a spleen, spleen, come on, where is it?
[6328.84s -> 6337.68s]  Lung, common, common, common, rough.
[6337.88s -> 6339.74s]  No one's buying today.
[6339.74s -> 6346.80s]  Sell nerve clusters, I don't have any.
[6346.80s -> 6352.82s]  I'm looking for a mythic lung.
[6352.82s -> 6355.50s]  Damn.
[6355.50s -> 6357.42s]  Why would there be $3200 for a common lung?
[6357.42s -> 6361.97s]  Give me a break.
[6361.97s -> 6364.46s]  I don't think I'm gonna get it today.
[6365.30s -> 6368.52s]  This spleen is gonna plummet, sell it.
[6368.52s -> 6378.58s]  I don't have, why?
[6378.58s -> 6379.42s]  Mythic.
[6379.42s -> 6380.26s]  Oh!
[6384.29s -> 6390.34s]  That was so much money.
[6390.34s -> 6394.60s]  Oh, fuck these guys.
[6394.60s -> 6402.48s]  Ha, naughty creature, I don't care.
[6402.48s -> 6410.68s]  This is, I'm telling you, this isn't gonna play out.
[6410.68s -> 6411.76s]  My stock portfolio,
[6411.76s -> 6416.32s]  maybe I should buy some more securities.
[6416.32s -> 6420.44s]  You have to influence the stock market.
[6420.44s -> 6423.60s]  Yeah, but I mean, what do you wanna do?
[6423.60s -> 6424.92s]  Wait a minute.
[6424.92s -> 6426.16s]  Didn't they say that
[6426.20s -> 6429.24s]  something was gonna crash today, right?
[6429.24s -> 6432.08s]  What was it?
[6432.08s -> 6432.92s]  Something was gonna,
[6432.92s -> 6437.06s]  they said something was gonna crash today.
[6437.06s -> 6441.00s]  Nerves, okay, where's the nerves?
[6441.00s -> 6442.56s]  Nerve clusters are gonna crash today.
[6442.56s -> 6444.96s]  All right, so when the nerve clusters clash,
[6444.96s -> 6451.80s]  I'm gonna buy a shitload of stock on the UTF.
[6451.80s -> 6458.14s]  Why would people buy this?
[6458.14s -> 6460.26s]  So tomorrow, remind me to come back here
[6460.26s -> 6461.34s]  because we're buying,
[6462.76s -> 6465.59s]  buying the dip.
[6465.59s -> 6469.22s]  All right, let's go.
[6469.22s -> 6470.89s]  Aim it up front.
[6470.89s -> 6471.81s]  Enter, I'm entering.
[6471.81s -> 6473.85s]  The guy with all the TV ads, he's a bit visible,
[6473.85s -> 6475.33s]  but sure, I can take him out.
[6475.33s -> 6478.21s]  Just need my large rot cane up front.
[6478.21s -> 6481.18s]  Okay, large rot cane.
[6481.18s -> 6483.22s]  Soul, a new soul,
[6483.22s -> 6489.47s]  rot cane, soul, and a lung.
[6489.47s -> 6493.97s]  Large rot cane.
[6493.97s -> 6497.09s]  Warlord Artigan declares a temporary truce
[6497.09s -> 6498.89s]  in all territories occupied by his armies.
[6498.89s -> 6502.00s]  Organ traders react in outrage.
[6502.00s -> 6503.36s]  Oh my goodness gracious,
[6503.36s -> 6504.48s]  the market just fucking tanked
[6504.48s -> 6507.35s]  and I can just get a bunch of cheap shit here.
[6507.35s -> 6508.19s]  I think I'm gonna,
[6508.19s -> 6509.79s]  so I just bought, all right.
[6509.79s -> 6515.99s]  All right, I'm gonna buy a bunch of cheap nerve clusters.
[6516.83s -> 6521.17s]  And this lung.
[6521.17s -> 6522.57s]  I need more space in my inventory.
[6522.57s -> 6523.41s]  What is this?
[6523.41s -> 6528.96s]  Get rid of it.
[6528.96s -> 6530.12s]  Liver, I already have that.
[6530.12s -> 6533.52s]  Here you go.
[6533.52s -> 6542.08s]  You want a soul.
[6542.08s -> 6545.08s]  I'm buying low.
[6545.08s -> 6548.88s]  I need a soul though.
[6548.88s -> 6553.96s]  Oh man, that was a good one.
[6553.96s -> 6555.92s]  These are, look at this, valuable.
[6555.92s -> 6558.36s]  B plus 68 quality, 53, 45.
[6558.36s -> 6559.20s]  I mean, they're not great,
[6559.20s -> 6560.02s]  but like these will be,
[6560.02s -> 6564.55s]  this will go way higher tomorrow.
[6564.55s -> 6569.95s]  I need a soul.
[6569.95s -> 6576.42s]  Dude, somebody sell a soul to me, please.
[6576.42s -> 6581.38s]  I'll take that.
[6581.38s -> 6582.46s]  I know you're trying to make a profit,
[6582.46s -> 6583.74s]  but if you help me and some friends
[6583.78s -> 6586.38s]  undercut the price of nerve clusters,
[6586.38s -> 6592.11s]  it would let me treat a lot of people.
[6592.11s -> 6593.79s]  Sorry, I just bought like four of them.
[6593.79s -> 6597.93s]  I'm sorry.
[6597.93s -> 6606.72s]  Soul, soul.
[6606.72s -> 6610.20s]  Come on.
[6610.20s -> 6616.79s]  Shard, shards.
[6616.79s -> 6625.02s]  Maybe I should buy a shard and hold onto it.
[6625.02s -> 6626.68s]  Nobody's selling anything.
[6626.68s -> 6628.64s]  What is this?
[6628.64s -> 6631.30s]  I mean, see if I can get a heart,
[6631.30s -> 6633.92s]  heart or a soul.
[6633.92s -> 6634.74s]  I'll take it.
[6634.74s -> 6636.48s]  I didn't make it at this point.
[6636.48s -> 6640.85s]  No, no, all right.
[6640.85s -> 6642.49s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[6642.49s -> 6646.17s]  Look at this shit.
[6646.17s -> 6652.28s]  What about my, oh, oh no.
[6652.28s -> 6657.80s]  No, oh no.
[6657.80s -> 6660.32s]  Ooh, ooh, that hurts.
[6660.32s -> 6668.19s]  That really hurts.
[6668.19s -> 6669.53s]  I'm gonna get my cost down.
[6669.53s -> 6680.27s]  I'm gonna get my cost average down.
[6680.27s -> 6681.11s]  I can look at all this.
[6681.11s -> 6689.84s]  I got all this cash coming up here.
[6689.84s -> 6690.68s]  What?
[6690.68s -> 6692.08s]  No, I wanted to start the trading day.
[6692.08s -> 6692.92s]  What?
[6692.92s -> 6694.04s]  I was just so confused.
[6694.04s -> 6696.36s]  I just sat there silently for five seconds.
[6696.36s -> 6703.45s]  What did I just do?
[6703.45s -> 6710.35s]  Jard, jard, heart.
[6710.35s -> 6711.19s]  Oh Jesus.
[6711.19s -> 6712.83s]  Okay, how much?
[6712.83s -> 6720.44s]  I need a soul, a shard and a heart.
[6725.68s -> 6727.54s]  Soul and a shard.
[6727.54s -> 6729.86s]  Ah, I can't afford it.
[6729.86s -> 6732.28s]  What?
[6732.28s -> 6734.48s]  That's a soul, I got it, I got it.
[6734.48s -> 6736.36s]  Oh my God, that's a huge return.
[6736.36s -> 6737.84s]  Thank God.
[6737.84s -> 6738.68s]  Jard.
[6744.38s -> 6745.72s]  What do you want?
[6745.72s -> 6749.16s]  I want large rot cane.
[6749.16s -> 6750.24s]  I gotta get rid of this.
[6750.24s -> 6751.16s]  Large rot cane.
[6751.16s -> 6753.51s]  What else do you guys want?
[6753.51s -> 6756.77s]  Heart.
[6756.77s -> 6762.46s]  Heart and a large rot cane.
[6762.46s -> 6765.10s]  That's the heart.
[6765.10s -> 6766.02s]  Need a rot cane.
[6769.00s -> 6770.80s]  Large rot cane, rot cane, rot cane, rot cane.
[6770.80s -> 6772.32s]  Any more requests?
[6772.32s -> 6773.90s]  Eyeball.
[6773.90s -> 6778.47s]  And you, fuck, outta here.
[6778.47s -> 6779.65s]  Eyeball.
[6779.65s -> 6780.49s]  Rot cane?
[6780.49s -> 6781.31s]  Is it large?
[6781.31s -> 6787.81s]  It's tiny.
[6787.81s -> 6789.01s]  Shipment of gallbladders arrives.
[6789.01s -> 6793.94s]  A regulator shudder at the market impacts to come.
[6793.94s -> 6795.10s]  Fuck you.
[6795.10s -> 6797.34s]  Oh no, they're so cheap.
[6797.34s -> 6800.20s]  I want them all.
[6800.20s -> 6801.80s]  I just bought the worst ones.
[6801.80s -> 6804.04s]  I bought the actually worst ones.
[6804.04s -> 6805.48s]  Sell them, sell them back.
[6806.69s -> 6808.33s]  Almond, mythic, mythic.
[6808.33s -> 6809.89s]  That one's a good quality.
[6809.89s -> 6816.42s]  Rare, large and rare.
[6816.42s -> 6818.93s]  Large, rare and large.
[6818.93s -> 6821.32s]  Mythic, but bad quality.
[6821.32s -> 6824.70s]  Rough, rough, rough, rough, rough,
[6824.70s -> 6825.90s]  rough, rough, rough, rough, rough.
[6825.90s -> 6829.01s]  I want mythic.
[6829.01s -> 6831.64s]  No, don't just flood myself.
[6831.64s -> 6833.08s]  I need to upgrade my cargo space
[6833.08s -> 6837.98s]  instead of putting $40,000 under the fucking stock market.
[6837.98s -> 6838.82s]  It's all right.
[6838.82s -> 6840.81s]  It's okay, we'll be fine.
[6840.81s -> 6842.99s]  I need a rot cane.
[6842.99s -> 6846.38s]  No, too big.
[6846.38s -> 6852.94s]  Average rot cane.
[6852.94s -> 6856.46s]  Are these gonna go up in value?
[6856.46s -> 6859.47s]  Oh no.
[6859.47s -> 6861.15s]  Average price paid, three.
[6861.15s -> 6869.89s]  See, I'm fine.
[6869.89s -> 6874.16s]  But look at this, I could buy some of this.
[6874.16s -> 6886.26s]  Oh, I want it so bad.
[6886.26s -> 6889.11s]  I want it so bad.
[6889.11s -> 6889.95s]  Is this live?
[6889.95s -> 6893.24s]  Yeah, this is twitch.tv, man.
[6893.24s -> 6894.24s]  I need cargo space.
[6894.24s -> 6896.76s]  All right, I'm gonna just make money.
[6896.76s -> 6898.20s]  I'm not gonna look at anything, just make money.
[6898.20s -> 6901.68s]  Oh my fucking God, I'm trying to start the trading day.
[6901.68s -> 6902.80s]  Not sell something.
[6903.80s -> 6906.08s]  $600 less than what I bought it for.
[6911.88s -> 6917.35s]  Kidney, kidneys.
[6917.35s -> 6924.25s]  Okay, kidneys, kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6924.25s -> 6925.09s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6925.09s -> 6925.93s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6925.93s -> 6926.77s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6926.77s -> 6929.03s]  Kidney, kidney, kidney.
[6929.03s -> 6929.87s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6929.87s -> 6930.71s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6930.71s -> 6931.55s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6931.55s -> 6933.97s]  Kidney, kidney, stomach, eyeball.
[6933.97s -> 6950.74s]  Ooh, you need kidney, kidneys.
[6950.74s -> 6953.69s]  This is not large, kidney.
[6953.69s -> 6954.53s]  I need that.
[6954.53s -> 6958.09s]  Don't buy that, you fucking stupid, you goddamn mutt.
[6958.13s -> 6969.55s]  I don't want, eyeball.
[6969.55s -> 6987.02s]  Don't buy that, you dumb dog.
[6987.02s -> 6988.62s]  I need a, okay, let's fill this mug.
[6988.62s -> 6994.24s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
[6994.24s -> 6997.69s]  Stupid dog, you make me look bad.
[6997.69s -> 6999.74s]  Bugga, buga, buga, buga, buga.
[6999.74s -> 7000.98s]  In two days, ports across the galaxy
[7000.98s -> 7008.88s]  will be flooded with lungs.
[7008.88s -> 7012.72s]  Okay, eyeballs, all right.
[7012.72s -> 7016.07s]  Oh boy, what the hell is going on here?
[7016.07s -> 7021.80s]  What, oh, can I have one of these?
[7021.80s -> 7022.70s]  All right, what do I need?
[7022.70s -> 7027.00s]  I have 45 seconds.
[7027.00s -> 7033.50s]  Shard, heart, heart, heart, heart, stomach, eyeball.
[7037.01s -> 7047.20s]  Oh my God, shut up.
[7047.20s -> 7052.34s]  God, God, God, God.
[7052.34s -> 7054.62s]  Drop the shift books that'll shrink organs
[7054.62s -> 7057.12s]  instead of growing them.
[7057.12s -> 7062.96s]  I don't have $4,000, dude.
[7062.96s -> 7077.22s]  Shard, liver, shard, I need a shard and a liver.
[7077.22s -> 7078.66s]  Oh, no, you don't want a liver?
[7078.66s -> 7080.06s]  I thought lives depend on it.
[7080.06s -> 7087.30s]  I thought I said liver depends on it.
[7087.30s -> 7103.72s]  Dude, I need to buy this.
[7103.72s -> 7108.79s]  No more bullshit, how much, is this recovering yet?
[7108.79s -> 7115.26s]  I bought these for $2,1400, $800, oh, this is bad.
[7115.26s -> 7119.08s]  I still need a, I need a bladder and I need a shard.
[7119.08s -> 7126.53s]  Let's go, oh, I got it.
[7126.53s -> 7129.13s]  Bladder, I need to buy another bladder and a shard.
[7129.13s -> 7135.57s]  Fulfill this shit, shard, come on.
[7135.57s -> 7139.33s]  Laura, what do you want?
[7139.33s -> 7151.12s]  Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, liver, heart, heart,
[7151.28s -> 7156.09s]  liver, shard, heart, heart, liver, shard, rot cane.
[7156.09s -> 7163.16s]  Heart, liver, shard, heart, heart, heart, liver, shard.
[7163.16s -> 7178.50s]  Oh, I can't fucking, come on, dude.
[7178.50s -> 7184.14s]  Oh, thank you, all right.
[7184.14s -> 7185.58s]  Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart,
[7185.58s -> 7188.88s]  heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, liver, shard.
[7188.88s -> 7201.20s]  Relax, what am I doing?
[7201.20s -> 7205.66s]  How have I not had any, heart, heart, liver, shard?
[7205.66s -> 7207.22s]  You piece of shit, I needed that.
[7207.22s -> 7209.75s]  That was a large rot cane.
[7209.75s -> 7211.72s]  That's too much money.
[7211.72s -> 7214.32s]  I'm not spending $11,000 on this, come on, man.
[7214.32s -> 7218.87s]  Get out of here.
[7218.87s -> 7224.82s]  $16,000, what are you talking about?
[7224.82s -> 7229.74s]  Heart, heart, liver, shard, heart, heart, heart.
[7229.74s -> 7235.80s]  No, no, I need a shard.
[7235.80s -> 7239.30s]  I'm not leaving here till I get one.
[7239.30s -> 7245.44s]  Okay, that sucked, but it was at least I got it.
[7245.44s -> 7248.16s]  Now you need a liver.
[7248.16s -> 7258.72s]  Wait, now I need a heart.
[7258.72s -> 7266.79s]  Heart, come on, heart, come on, heart, come on,
[7266.79s -> 7268.75s]  heart, come on, oh.
[7269.27s -> 7272.43s]  I'm doing, I'm doing all right.
[7272.43s -> 7275.95s]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[7280.40s -> 7282.92s]  My average price, that's why you double down.
[7282.92s -> 7287.30s]  And now it's a $60,000, man, that's 100% profit.
[7287.30s -> 7289.65s]  I average this shit down.
[7289.65s -> 7293.38s]  After these, I bought it three.
[7293.38s -> 7297.32s]  Sell, I'll tell you what I'll do.
[7297.32s -> 7299.84s]  I'm gonna sell some, I'm not selling all.
[7299.84s -> 7311.37s]  I'm not cashing out, no, not the whole thing.
[7311.37s -> 7314.03s]  I'm leaving what I put in.
[7314.03s -> 7318.78s]  I got 30 grand in here, I just took it, look at that.
[7318.78s -> 7322.09s]  Now let's go for it, bingo.
[7322.09s -> 7324.33s]  More spaces, more capacity.
[7324.33s -> 7326.97s]  25% slower decaying of the units
[7326.97s -> 7329.88s]  that are inside the refrigerator.
[7329.88s -> 7339.90s]  Nice, put it on, oh yeah, two more slots.
[7339.90s -> 7344.11s]  This is 40 grand, this is 10 slots.
[7344.11s -> 7352.55s]  Ooh, okay, so if I do this, then I can hold onto some stuff.
[7352.55s -> 7354.39s]  You hit the cap, they can't go higher.
[7354.39s -> 7358.06s]  What do you mean cap?
[7358.06s -> 7360.66s]  Sell all, price is at the max, dude.
[7360.66s -> 7364.36s]  What are you talking about?
[7364.36s -> 7373.79s]  Oh, I did not understand what I was looking at.
[7373.79s -> 7379.13s]  This is the maximum it can possibly be?
[7379.13s -> 7385.58s]  I thought this was just the range that it's in right now.
[7385.58s -> 7387.18s]  That is the maximum.
[7389.17s -> 7391.29s]  I thought this was just a sort of range
[7391.29s -> 7397.20s]  that this is currently in.
[7397.20s -> 7399.44s]  I thought I saw nine, yeah, I think,
[7399.44s -> 7402.02s]  wait, you guys, I don't think you guys are right.
[7402.02s -> 7404.02s]  It was seven before, they're bullshitting you.
[7404.02s -> 7406.56s]  Yeah, yeah, guys, you don't know what you're talking about.
[7406.56s -> 7409.82s]  Yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about.
[7409.86s -> 7411.22s]  One guy, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7411.22s -> 7414.33s]  Well, you know, you didn't know what you're talking about.
[7414.33s -> 7417.00s]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[7417.00s -> 7418.48s]  I could come back then.
[7418.48s -> 7419.48s]  Why would you come back then?
[7419.48s -> 7422.33s]  We'll be closed.
[7422.33s -> 7429.73s]  All right, let's go.
[7430.81s -> 7435.93s]  I don't care, shard, kidney, liver.
[7435.93s -> 7437.61s]  Okay, let's fulfill this shit.
[7437.61s -> 7438.59s]  Okay, shard, liver.
[7438.59s -> 7440.63s]  Oh, God damn it, all these lungs.
[7444.12s -> 7449.03s]  They're too expensive.
[7449.03s -> 7452.08s]  That's your lucky liver.
[7452.08s -> 7453.48s]  That's like the best fucking character.
[7453.48s -> 7455.72s]  That's the best movie ever made, I think.
[7455.72s -> 7458.53s]  Fine Ghostbusters.
[7458.53s -> 7459.81s]  I don't wanna buy any of these.
[7459.81s -> 7463.41s]  Maybe they're all rough, common, common, rough.
[7463.41s -> 7465.67s]  This one's rare, but too expensive.
[7465.67s -> 7471.55s]  No, this would be somebody else's problem.
[7471.55s -> 7474.45s]  Stomach, I need a shard.
[7474.45s -> 7475.53s]  This is large raw cane.
[7475.53s -> 7478.31s]  I'm not gonna spend that much money.
[7478.31s -> 7481.08s]  What do you guys all want?
[7481.08s -> 7485.31s]  Kidneys, shards, kidney, shard, heart, liver.
[7485.31s -> 7487.51s]  Kidneys, shard, heart, liver.
[7487.51s -> 7495.53s]  Kidney, ugh, fine, no.
[7495.53s -> 7506.50s]  Kidneys, shard, heart, liver.
[7506.54s -> 7507.90s]  That's a few of them, at least.
[7507.90s -> 7510.14s]  1,200, I'll take it.
[7510.14s -> 7514.48s]  I need a heart and a liver.
[7514.48s -> 7517.80s]  Heart, I need hearts, man.
[7517.80s -> 7521.28s]  And go, all right, got it.
[7521.28s -> 7522.95s]  What?
[7522.95s -> 7524.79s]  I heart, a liver, oh, and a stomach.
[7524.79s -> 7530.69s]  I didn't read the second part.
[7530.69s -> 7534.11s]  I bought the wrong one.
[7534.11s -> 7538.53s]  I'm now a professional, all right.
[7538.53s -> 7539.53s]  Holy shit, eight grand?
[7539.53s -> 7541.11s]  I have emotions and they suck.
[7541.11s -> 7545.37s]  Get me a new brain.
[7545.37s -> 7547.37s]  I started screaming and I did not stop
[7547.37s -> 7548.77s]  and now we're crying, new lungs.
[7548.77s -> 7551.55s]  This is relatable, all right.
[7551.55s -> 7552.39s]  All right, all right, all right, all right,
[7552.55s -> 7556.61s]  right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,
[7556.61s -> 7558.20s]  right, right, right, right.
[7558.20s -> 7566.07s]  Do I need, okay, I need, I'll do it tomorrow.
[7566.07s -> 7572.31s]  I can't do it, my brain's too slow right now.
[7573.27s -> 7576.76s]  Who are you?
[7576.76s -> 7582.68s]  I'll do it tomorrow.
[7582.68s -> 7584.96s]  This is why I wanted to buy into that nerve index.
[7584.96s -> 7594.68s]  Look at this, that's a 100% increase.
[7594.68s -> 7605.64s]  And it's not even a bad time to buy it, I don't think.
[7605.64s -> 7611.96s]  Liver, bladder, and kidney, okay.
[7611.96s -> 7620.14s]  Don't FOMO, the valve nerve index
[7620.14s -> 7625.54s]  is what you're gonna play Half-Life 3 on.
[7626.02s -> 7627.62s]  I need good lungs.
[7627.62s -> 7628.86s]  Let me fulfill these ones first
[7628.86s -> 7630.90s]  because I'm gonna get so caught up here.
[7634.03s -> 7641.92s]  Lungs, lung, brain, lung, brain, shard,
[7642.08s -> 7645.08s]  rot cane, lung, brain, shard.
[7645.08s -> 7650.76s]  Whoa, lung, brain, shard.
[7650.76s -> 7654.66s]  Brains are gonna be cheap.
[7654.66s -> 7656.64s]  Lung, brain, shard, I got the shard.
[7656.64s -> 7662.45s]  Lung, brain, lung, that's, that, lungs are awful.
[7662.85s -> 7669.54s]  Lung, brain, lymph, lung, brain.
[7670.42s -> 7681.40s]  Oh, my eyes, okay, I'm buying that.
[7681.40s -> 7685.52s]  I need to buy a brain, what is that?
[7685.52s -> 7694.24s]  Shard, wait, I didn't even need that.
[7694.24s -> 7698.72s]  Okay, all right, I need a brain and lungs.
[7698.72s -> 7703.05s]  Brain, lungs, give me some lungs.
[7703.05s -> 7706.00s]  That's a brain right there, dude.
[7706.00s -> 7714.89s]  I bought the fucking expensive one, idiot.
[7714.89s -> 7724.33s]  Give me a shitty pair of lungs, shitty lungs.
[7724.33s -> 7727.93s]  You need to diversify, you're too focused in biotech.
[7728.09s -> 7738.38s]  I need, any lungs will do, please.
[7738.38s -> 7742.84s]  Any lungs will do.
[7742.84s -> 7744.60s]  Ooh, I got it, how would you,
[7744.60s -> 7749.44s]  oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, how would you pay for this?
[7749.44s -> 7754.16s]  Oh, oh, oh, I thought it was 1,300, no, no.
[7754.16s -> 7762.20s]  Tell it back immediately, I'll buy a cheaper one.
[7762.20s -> 7763.44s]  I thought that was way cheaper.
[7763.44s -> 7765.88s]  A lung about, okay, I need lungs.
[7765.88s -> 7769.44s]  No, you stupid game, it's a great game.
[7769.44s -> 7772.88s]  Lungs, I hit E instead of W, it's my own fault.
[7788.88s -> 7794.08s]  Need to buy nerve agent.
[7794.08s -> 7797.29s]  I need to get rid of all this junk.
[7797.29s -> 7798.21s]  How much did I buy this for?
[7798.21s -> 7804.59s]  All right, I'm just like, I made money on it.
[7804.59s -> 7807.97s]  This is expensive, I'm losing a little bit on here.
[7807.97s -> 7811.92s]  People need this shit though, it comes in all the time.
[7811.92s -> 7815.44s]  Let's go.
[7815.44s -> 7819.79s]  All right, lungs, lungs and a large rock cane.
[7819.79s -> 7823.79s]  Good lungs that are over 54.
[7823.79s -> 7827.33s]  That brain is cheap and I'm afraid to pull the trigger on it.
[7827.33s -> 7829.65s]  Spleens will, the market price plummets
[7829.65s -> 7830.85s]  in response to Spleens.
[7832.32s -> 7840.94s]  Got it, I didn't even see what it was.
[7840.94s -> 7845.16s]  It wasn't good enough.
[7845.16s -> 7847.69s]  Can I just buy up all the Spleens?
[7847.69s -> 7851.39s]  At least the expensive ones.
[7851.39s -> 7854.33s]  All right, I'm out of space.
[7854.33s -> 7858.88s]  This thing's a piece of shit, get rid of it.
[7858.88s -> 7872.36s]  Lung above 54, didn't I just have one?
[7872.36s -> 7877.67s]  I'm just buying up all the Spleens, fuck it.
[7877.67s -> 7883.79s]  Never degrades, increases condition of nearby organs.
[7883.79s -> 7887.42s]  Are you serious?
[7887.42s -> 7894.44s]  Can I move it around?
[7894.44s -> 7895.80s]  All right, I'm getting overwhelmed.
[7895.80s -> 7897.16s]  Lung above 54.
[7899.20s -> 7905.96s]  Ah, brain above 68 and large rock cane.
[7909.20s -> 7919.03s]  Okay, brain above 68, no.
[7919.03s -> 7919.91s]  Spleens are about to be cheap.
[7919.91s -> 7922.39s]  Oh, they just did, they are cheap now.
[7922.39s -> 7926.62s]  I bought a bunch of them.
[7926.62s -> 7933.01s]  I'm running out of time.
[7933.01s -> 7937.05s]  Brain, no.
[7937.05s -> 7939.65s]  Lung 79, do I need that?
[7939.65s -> 7941.75s]  What?
[7941.75s -> 7942.79s]  Yeah, I need that.
[7942.79s -> 7943.99s]  Yeah, I need that.
[7943.99s -> 7948.60s]  Yeah, I need that.
[7948.60s -> 7949.96s]  Oh, come on.
[7949.96s -> 7951.52s]  Okay, good, good, good, good, good, got it.
[7951.52s -> 7953.64s]  Nice, hell yeah.
[7953.64s -> 7956.43s]  All right, let's get some more requests in here.
[7956.43s -> 7959.96s]  Liver under 26.
[7959.96s -> 7964.85s]  I need a heart and a pancreas.
[7964.85s -> 7971.10s]  I might actually have some of that already, I do.
[7971.10s -> 7972.93s]  All right, market.
[7972.93s -> 7976.57s]  Get up there.
[7976.57s -> 7977.77s]  Am I in my prime yet?
[7977.77s -> 7983.95s]  I don't think so.
[7983.95s -> 7987.00s]  When is the human skin market gonna open?
[7987.00s -> 7992.98s]  I don't know.
[7992.98s -> 7996.33s]  We can almost do this one.
[7996.33s -> 7999.85s]  All right, so Spleens are cheap as hell right now.
[7999.85s -> 8000.89s]  And this increases the quality
[8000.89s -> 8002.53s]  of everything around it, right?
[8002.53s -> 8005.21s]  Now this does.
[8005.21s -> 8006.09s]  How far does that reach?
[8006.09s -> 8009.08s]  I feel like this is a good idea.
[8009.16s -> 8011.23s]  Nice kidney here.
[8011.23s -> 8017.74s]  Got some valuable Spleens.
[8017.74s -> 8019.10s]  Buy Spleens stock.
[8019.10s -> 8031.17s]  Now that's cooking with gas.
[8031.17s -> 8045.20s]  Oh, I almost just tried to buy $32,000 worth.
[8045.20s -> 8047.34s]  All right, 10 grand, I'll do 10.
[8047.34s -> 8056.40s]  I'm not going all in.
[8056.40s -> 8058.73s]  Nerve cluster, all right.
[8058.73s -> 8059.93s]  I gotta get rid of these two.
[8059.93s -> 8067.16s]  Now, brain over 68 and a large rot cane.
[8067.16s -> 8069.16s]  Oh, shit.
[8069.16s -> 8072.26s]  Brain over 68.
[8072.26s -> 8074.86s]  Brain over 68, cheap too, come on.
[8076.29s -> 8077.97s]  Brain over 68, that's, no.
[8085.56s -> 8087.48s]  Large rot cane, yeah.
[8090.92s -> 8103.69s]  Now I need another rot cane.
[8103.69s -> 8107.07s]  Come on, what about my shit here?
[8107.07s -> 8109.48s]  They're going up in value.
[8109.48s -> 8111.96s]  This is pretty good.
[8111.96s -> 8115.48s]  Still need a rot cane.
[8115.48s -> 8122.25s]  Rough quality, no thanks.
[8122.25s -> 8128.58s]  Rot cane, valuable but terrible condition.
[8128.58s -> 8131.24s]  Terrible condition, just terrible.
[8131.24s -> 8137.88s]  Awful, these are all such junk.
[8137.92s -> 8140.93s]  Terrible, sell low, buy high.
[8140.93s -> 8148.52s]  Just awful, just terrible condition.
[8148.52s -> 8151.14s]  It's common, just awful.
[8151.14s -> 8155.77s]  Ooh, aw.
[8155.77s -> 8160.44s]  All right, I need some, anybody want a brain?
[8160.44s -> 8163.40s]  I still need rot canes and I need a pancreas.
[8163.40s -> 8169.61s]  Rot cane, pancreas and a liver under 36.
[8169.61s -> 8173.14s]  Can I just see a pancreas?
[8173.14s -> 8184.27s]  Pancreas, dick, come on.
[8184.27s -> 8192.92s]  Rot cane, 80 but, okay, that's a return.
[8192.92s -> 8194.43s]  That's a return.
[8194.43s -> 8195.51s]  I mean, it's a terrible return
[8196.07s -> 8203.11s]  No, it's not worth it.
[8203.11s -> 8206.89s]  I'll hold.
[8206.89s -> 8208.29s]  Here we go.
[8208.29s -> 8213.44s]  Of 21% today.
[8213.44s -> 8222.00s]  Damn it.
[8222.00s -> 8223.12s]  What's this person say?
[8223.12s -> 8225.46s]  Hey Jerma, I like to watch your streams
[8225.46s -> 8227.02s]  while I run and lift at the gym.
[8227.02s -> 8228.50s]  The games are pretty engaging
[8228.50s -> 8230.94s]  and your recycled jokes always get me pumped up.
[8232.38s -> 8241.60s]  Please play Doki, I'm never gonna play that game.
[8241.60s -> 8244.16s]  All right, do I sell the spleen stock?
[8244.16s -> 8246.24s]  Just take the return here, the 20%.
[8246.24s -> 8248.64s]  Just let it ride and just sell it 600.
[8248.64s -> 8256.85s]  Speed, oh my God.
[8256.85s -> 8259.61s]  The phantom buyer, legend of the trading community.
[8259.61s -> 8262.05s]  Hailing from urgent, origins unknown.
[8262.05s -> 8263.77s]  Browses fast and buys faster.
[8263.77s -> 8265.56s]  They're a menace.
[8265.56s -> 8267.48s]  I'm not gonna pay $8,000.
[8267.48s -> 8271.64s]  That's too much.
[8271.64s -> 8274.80s]  Shit.
[8274.80s -> 8277.32s]  The brain stock because of the market overload.
[8277.32s -> 8278.16s]  Not a bad idea.
[8291.57s -> 8299.53s]  I don't have enough money.
[8299.53s -> 8304.14s]  Pancreas and rot cane, let's go.
[8304.14s -> 8308.72s]  Market quakes if you're a large shipment of lungs.
[8308.72s -> 8310.48s]  I like need them.
[8310.48s -> 8312.00s]  You always need these.
[8312.00s -> 8314.45s]  I'm gonna buy the cheap ones.
[8315.29s -> 8316.53s]  Just scavenged like a little vulture
[8316.53s -> 8323.27s]  and just buy the crappy, cheap, terrible ones.
[8323.27s -> 8332.00s]  Yeah, 1,500, 1,600, just junk.
[8332.00s -> 8333.20s]  The shard is pretty good.
[8333.20s -> 8334.48s]  I think I'm gonna get rid of the spleens.
[8334.48s -> 8341.07s]  I have a return on all of them.
[8341.07s -> 8348.36s]  Oh, heart, heart, lung.
[8348.36s -> 8349.20s]  Ooh, hurry.
[8354.88s -> 8357.29s]  I have the shard.
[8357.29s -> 8358.89s]  I don't have the lung.
[8358.89s -> 8362.44s]  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[8362.44s -> 8364.80s]  Oh yeah.
[8364.80s -> 8368.96s]  Heart, a heart and a pancreas.
[8368.96s -> 8377.20s]  Oh, look at me just flooding the market.
[8378.12s -> 8385.87s]  Somebody needs that.
[8385.87s -> 8388.56s]  And let me read the heart, two hearts.
[8388.56s -> 8390.76s]  Heart, heart, pancreas.
[8390.76s -> 8392.48s]  Heart, heart, rot cane, pancreas.
[8392.48s -> 8395.72s]  Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8395.72s -> 8398.72s]  Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8398.72s -> 8401.24s]  Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8403.00s -> 8405.16s]  Heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8406.48s -> 8409.08s]  Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8411.23s -> 8415.64s]  Pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8415.64s -> 8418.92s]  Pancreas, rot cane.
[8418.92s -> 8420.56s]  Pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8423.00s -> 8425.20s]  Heart, heart, pancreas, pancreas, rot cane.
[8428.98s -> 8434.57s]  Heart, wha!
[8434.57s -> 8435.77s]  Pancreas, pancreas.
[8435.77s -> 8437.16s]  Do I get it?
[8437.16s -> 8438.00s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[8438.00s -> 8440.24s]  Look at that money flying.
[8447.96s -> 8456.26s]  Ooh, shard, brain, shard and brain.
[8456.26s -> 8458.04s]  Oh, fuck.
[8458.04s -> 8464.56s]  Sorry.
[8464.56s -> 8465.96s]  I think I'm gonna get, yeah.
[8465.96s -> 8473.06s]  I'm scared about this bottoming out again.
[8473.06s -> 8476.89s]  Why won't this move?
[8476.89s -> 8479.40s]  Yeah, I'm selling.
[8479.40s -> 8483.74s]  I'm selling everything.
[8483.78s -> 8485.86s]  I'm just completely cleaning out here.
[8485.86s -> 8491.42s]  I need the money.
[8491.42s -> 8502.60s]  Remember, you used to be cool.
[8502.60s -> 8504.08s]  I need that, listen to me.
[8504.08s -> 8504.92s]  Do you hear that?
[8504.92s -> 8505.88s]  It was always, it was getting there.
[8505.88s -> 8509.65s]  I was trying to make it happen.
[8509.65s -> 8515.48s]  I need $40,000 to get the upgrade.
[8515.48s -> 8516.36s]  There was nothing in that cup.
[8516.36s -> 8520.20s]  You just pretended to drink.
[8520.20s -> 8521.68s]  I'm an entertainer.
[8521.68s -> 8523.88s]  So I need to, like, if I'm gonna have to pretend
[8523.88s -> 8525.32s]  to do stuff to entertain you,
[8525.32s -> 8526.56s]  like I pretended to drink.
[8526.56s -> 8527.68s]  Yeah, I did.
[8527.68s -> 8530.64s]  But I'm an entertainer.
[8530.64s -> 8533.10s]  It's my job, right?
[8533.10s -> 8535.10s]  I'm gonna pretend to like slurp drinks and stuff
[8535.10s -> 8543.64s]  and people think it's funny.
[8543.64s -> 8544.72s]  What a theater kid.
[8547.55s -> 8553.01s]  Okay, let me, there's a lot of money here on the line.
[8553.01s -> 8559.34s]  Brain, shard, pancreas.
[8559.34s -> 8565.01s]  Brain, shard, pancreas, bad liver.
[8565.01s -> 8569.94s]  Brain, shard, pancreas, bad liver, got it?
[8569.94s -> 8571.54s]  Brain, shard, pancreas.
[8571.54s -> 8574.16s]  Oh, that was expensive.
[8574.16s -> 8575.72s]  Oh, that was expensive.
[8575.72s -> 8577.56s]  Brain, shard, pancreas, liver.
[8577.56s -> 8586.82s]  Brain, I need a brain.
[8586.82s -> 8591.86s]  Lung, kidney.
[8591.86s -> 8594.66s]  I slept on my side yesterday and now my kidney hurts.
[8594.82s -> 8596.85s]  Dying.
[8596.85s -> 8598.25s]  Oh boy, rot cane.
[8598.25s -> 8602.11s]  All right, let's take a look.
[8602.11s -> 8602.95s]  Here we go.
[8602.95s -> 8605.09s]  I gotta do these like nursery rhymes.
[8605.09s -> 8610.74s]  Rot cane, rot cane, kidney.
[8610.74s -> 8614.92s]  Kidney, kidney, rot cane.
[8614.92s -> 8616.28s]  Kidney, kidney, rot cane.
[8616.28s -> 8620.16s]  Lung, brain.
[8620.16s -> 8623.08s]  Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.
[8623.08s -> 8625.44s]  Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.
[8625.44s -> 8627.95s]  Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.
[8627.95s -> 8630.43s]  Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.
[8630.43s -> 8632.63s]  Kidney, kidney, rot, cane, brain.
[8632.63s -> 8633.79s]  Rot, cane, brain.
[8633.79s -> 8635.03s]  Rot, cane, brain.
[8635.03s -> 8639.83s]  Rot, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain,
[8639.83s -> 8641.99s]  brain, brain, brain, brain.
[8641.99s -> 8642.83s]  That's all I need.
[8647.24s -> 8648.52s]  Now what?
[8648.52s -> 8651.44s]  18,000.
[8651.44s -> 8654.40s]  I think I can learn them out with four souls
[8654.40s -> 8656.64s]  at wholesale prices, my treat.
[8656.64s -> 8659.04s]  Four souls.
[8659.04s -> 8662.94s]  I'll give you 200 dollars for that liver, shard.
[8662.94s -> 8667.07s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8667.07s -> 8671.51s]  I need a new rhyme.
[8671.51s -> 8680.05s]  Lungs, lung, shard, lip.
[8680.05s -> 8681.77s]  Universe-wide strike for better labor conditions.
[8681.77s -> 8684.70s]  Organ barges halt mid-delivery.
[8684.70s -> 8686.87s]  Huh?
[8686.87s -> 8689.04s]  I'm trying to make a song up.
[8689.04s -> 8697.05s]  Lung, lung, shard, lung, shard, liver.
[8697.05s -> 8702.14s]  Lung, shard, liver, four souls.
[8702.14s -> 8706.06s]  Lung, shard, liver, four souls with a brain.
[8706.06s -> 8710.08s]  Lung, shard, liver, four souls with a brain.
[8710.08s -> 8712.84s]  Lung, shard, liver, four souls.
[8712.84s -> 8724.92s]  Lung, shard, liver, so.
[8724.92s -> 8725.96s]  I got a lot of money.
[8726.96s -> 8734.94s]  I would hate to be behind this guy in the grocery store.
[8741.38s -> 8743.22s]  Just walking around like,
[8743.22s -> 8748.96s]  milk, eggs, butter, peanut butter.
[8748.96s -> 8753.16s]  Almonds, Doritos, milk, butter, peanut butter.
[8753.16s -> 8760.12s]  I would be like, this guy's fucking crazy.
[8760.12s -> 8766.12s]  Toilet paper, toilet paper, paper towels, paper plates.
[8766.12s -> 8774.80s]  Milk, eggs, butter, peanut butter.
[8774.80s -> 8779.93s]  Oh, yay, yay.
[8779.93s -> 8781.13s]  Oh, great commentary.
[8784.69s -> 8789.59s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[8789.59s -> 8790.59s]  I don't think I'd want to do that
[8790.59s -> 8797.73s]  because sometimes my grocery list is kind of gross.
[8797.73s -> 8800.29s]  Ground beef, dog treats.
[8800.29s -> 8801.85s]  Ground beef, dog treats.
[8801.85s -> 8804.43s]  Ground beef, dog treats.
[8804.43s -> 8812.96s]  You're like, what is this guy making?
[8812.96s -> 8818.14s]  Cottage cheese, ground beef, raw chicken, dog treats.
[8818.14s -> 8824.30s]  Ugh.
[8824.30s -> 8827.86s]  I can afford the new upgrade.
[8827.86s -> 8842.04s]  Should have held, should have held it.
[8842.04s -> 8843.52s]  It's gonna die, hey, hey.
[8843.52s -> 8849.75s]  It's gonna double bottom right here.
[8849.75s -> 8851.07s]  Buying this one.
[8851.07s -> 8852.92s]  All right, bang.
[8852.92s -> 8855.00s]  This is 10 capacity
[8855.00s -> 8857.97s]  and no longer nothing corrodes in here anymore.
[8857.97s -> 8866.27s]  Oh yeah.
[8866.27s -> 8867.47s]  I should probably buy, hold on.
[8867.47s -> 8868.63s]  Something else tanked.
[8868.63s -> 8869.59s]  What tanked?
[8869.59s -> 8872.32s]  Everything.
[8872.32s -> 8873.80s]  What tanked the most?
[8873.80s -> 8882.48s]  Kendixes?
[8882.48s -> 8884.60s]  Oh, the mark is just dumped.
[8884.60s -> 8886.11s]  It's all right.
[8886.11s -> 8887.11s]  Strike tanked everything.
[8887.11s -> 8894.15s]  All right, okay, okay, okay.
[8894.15s -> 8899.24s]  Changes surrounding organs in the process.
[8899.24s -> 8901.73s]  I have, I need four souls.
[8901.73s -> 8904.29s]  That's a lot.
[8904.29s -> 8907.42s]  What's this one?
[8907.42s -> 8908.86s]  Loaning lab may have been lying to me.
[8908.86s -> 8910.74s]  I think they want to own the organ trade.
[8910.74s -> 8912.26s]  Send me a shard.
[8912.26s -> 8914.76s]  All right, four souls and a shard.
[8914.76s -> 8920.89s]  Go.
[8920.89s -> 8924.66s]  Soul, I gotta stop taking the ones that are souls.
[8924.66s -> 8925.54s]  Looked through my hunting traps
[8925.54s -> 8927.62s]  and found a prime nerve cluster 2400.
[8927.62s -> 8928.46s]  Sure, I'll take it.
[8928.46s -> 8932.18s]  What does it look like?
[8932.18s -> 8933.70s]  Ooh, I can already, 3500?
[8933.70s -> 8934.54s]  I'll take it.
[8934.54s -> 8936.77s]  Thank you.
[8936.77s -> 8938.65s]  All right, I need some more.
[8938.65s -> 8944.85s]  All right.
[8944.85s -> 8945.69s]  Do I already have any of these?
[8945.69s -> 8947.56s]  I got this one already.
[8947.60s -> 8948.76s]  Here's your soul.
[8948.76s -> 8953.08s]  Thanks for the 4000 bucks.
[8953.08s -> 8954.36s]  Okay.
[8955.24s -> 8956.24s]  Go.
[8956.24s -> 8957.24s]  I'll take that one too.
[8957.24s -> 8962.24s]  And I'll take that one.
[8962.24s -> 8966.65s]  Eye, bad liver.
[8966.65s -> 8968.61s]  Eye, bladder, bad liver.
[8968.61s -> 8971.43s]  Eye, bladder, bad liver shard.
[8971.43s -> 8972.67s]  Eye, bladder.
[8972.67s -> 8973.87s]  That's a cheap brain.
[8973.87s -> 8978.87s]  Eye, bladder, bad liver shard.
[8978.87s -> 8992.36s]  Bladder, bad liver.
[8992.36s -> 8993.20s]  Got it.
[8995.59s -> 8997.27s]  A lung in five days.
[8997.27s -> 8998.71s]  Look at how much money this is.
[8998.71s -> 9000.15s]  Eyeball and roctane.
[9001.88s -> 9005.18s]  Lungs.
[9005.18s -> 9006.02s]  What do you want for here?
[9006.02s -> 9007.58s]  You want bladder?
[9007.58s -> 9009.93s]  Fuck out of here.
[9009.93s -> 9012.62s]  This is worth so much more money.
[9012.62s -> 9014.14s]  All right, now let's get a song here.
[9014.14s -> 9017.95s]  Release something in my brain I can remember what to do.
[9017.95s -> 9019.35s]  Okay, stomach.
[9019.35s -> 9021.71s]  Stomach, soul.
[9021.71s -> 9024.27s]  Stomach, soul, eyeball, roctane.
[9024.27s -> 9027.11s]  Stomach, soul, eyeball, roctane, lungs.
[9027.11s -> 9029.87s]  Stomach, soul, eyeball, octane.
[9029.87s -> 9031.63s]  Stomach, soul, octane.
[9031.63s -> 9032.83s]  I forget it.
[9032.83s -> 9034.75s]  Stomach, soul.
[9034.79s -> 9036.99s]  Stomach, soul, roctane, eyeball.
[9036.99s -> 9038.99s]  Stomach, soul, roctane, eyeball.
[9038.99s -> 9040.91s]  Stomach, soul, roctane, eyeball.
[9040.91s -> 9043.35s]  Stomach, soul, roctane.
[9043.35s -> 9045.07s]  Stomach, soul.
[9045.07s -> 9046.23s]  Stomach, soul.
[9048.86s -> 9049.88s]  Stomach.
[9049.88s -> 9052.48s]  Soul, I need soul.
[9052.48s -> 9054.78s]  Pain.
[9054.78s -> 9055.90s]  Eyeball.
[9055.90s -> 9056.74s]  Stomach.
[9056.74s -> 9058.87s]  Okay, got this one.
[9058.87s -> 9062.16s]  Got that one.
[9062.16s -> 9063.24s]  Stomach, soul.
[9063.24s -> 9064.40s]  Stomach?
[9064.40s -> 9065.24s]  All right, I have stomach.
[9065.24s -> 9066.16s]  Stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach.
[9066.16s -> 9069.11s]  What is this?
[9069.11s -> 9070.44s]  All right.
[9070.56s -> 9083.75s]  Ooh, I'm too slow.
[9083.75s -> 9087.00s]  This brain is, you need to pair them up.
[9087.00s -> 9088.52s]  Yeah, I'm doing the song wrong.
[9088.52s -> 9089.56s]  You're right.
[9089.56s -> 9092.16s]  Hey, thank you, ToastyBro, for the 10 community subs.
[9092.16s -> 9095.60s]  Thank you, Flybot for the 15 community subs.
[9095.60s -> 9097.72s]  Then we had an anonymous gifter with five community subs.
[9097.72s -> 9102.19s]  Thank you.
[9102.19s -> 9105.66s]  Somebody just got fucking banned, I think.
[9105.66s -> 9108.26s]  I looked over and saw, hey man, first time chatter.
[9108.26s -> 9109.70s]  I've been a long time viewer.
[9109.70s -> 9111.50s]  I was wondering if you're ever gonna play Among,
[9111.50s -> 9113.14s]  and then I saw them get deleted.
[9115.82s -> 9120.82s]  I don't know what you did, but apparently you're out of here.
[9125.07s -> 9127.43s]  To answer your question, no, I'm never gonna play Among Us
[9127.43s -> 9129.95s]  unless it's Among Us VR and I'm gonna play for 10 minutes.
[9129.95s -> 9137.01s]  And then I gotta smash my VR with a hammer.
[9137.01s -> 9143.00s]  All right, 60,000.
[9143.00s -> 9146.11s]  Hey, rovo, thanks for the 16 community subs.
[9146.11s -> 9147.47s]  Why'd I say 16?
[9147.47s -> 9149.62s]  You gave 10.
[9149.62s -> 9151.64s]  Where did that number come from?
[9151.64s -> 9154.64s]  I really don't know, I'm serious.
[9154.64s -> 9157.28s]  All right, let me see what I have to do.
[9157.28s -> 9159.87s]  Lungs.
[9159.87s -> 9160.83s]  Stomach, soul.
[9161.75s -> 9164.48s]  Lung, lung, stomach, soul.
[9164.48s -> 9167.03s]  Lung, lung, stomach, soul, liver.
[9167.03s -> 9169.43s]  Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.
[9169.43s -> 9172.04s]  Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.
[9172.04s -> 9174.56s]  Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.
[9174.56s -> 9176.92s]  Lung, lung, stomach, soul, bad liver.
[9176.92s -> 9178.12s]  Lung, lung, stomach.
[9178.12s -> 9179.36s]  Lung, lung, stomach.
[9179.36s -> 9181.47s]  Lung, lung, stomach.
[9181.47s -> 9184.99s]  Lung, lung, stomach.
[9184.99s -> 9186.15s]  Lung, lung.
[9186.15s -> 9187.43s]  Lung, lung.
[9187.43s -> 9188.71s]  Lung, lung.
[9188.71s -> 9194.91s]  Lung, lung.
[9194.91s -> 9201.21s]  Lung, lung.
[9201.21s -> 9205.26s]  Lung, lung.
[9205.26s -> 9206.22s]  No lungs today.
[9206.22s -> 9209.08s]  This is bad.
[9209.08s -> 9212.11s]  Liver and soul.
[9212.11s -> 9213.55s]  Nerve cluster.
[9213.55s -> 9219.02s]  Brain.
[9219.02s -> 9222.23s]  I need a new song.
[9222.23s -> 9223.44s]  What do I have?
[9223.44s -> 9225.54s]  I don't even know what these are.
[9225.54s -> 9227.50s]  I have kidneys, stomach, I have stomach.
[9227.50s -> 9229.22s]  I have a brain.
[9229.22s -> 9231.37s]  I have a brain right now.
[9231.37s -> 9233.19s]  I need to get rid of something.
[9233.19s -> 9235.49s]  All right, shit, I got a minute.
[9235.49s -> 9241.67s]  Nerve cluster, nerve, nerve, liver, soul.
[9241.67s -> 9244.84s]  Okay, nerve, liver, nerve, liver, soul.
[9244.84s -> 9247.26s]  Nerve, liver, soul.
[9247.26s -> 9249.48s]  Fuck.
[9249.48s -> 9253.88s]  Market rejoices, because he's murdering planets.
[9253.88s -> 9261.36s]  Holy shit.
[9261.36s -> 9268.12s]  All right, what do I need?
[9268.12s -> 9271.88s]  Nerve, liver, soul.
[9271.88s -> 9273.20s]  A mythic brain.
[9273.20s -> 9276.23s]  Give it to me.
[9276.23s -> 9284.68s]  Oh, 22,000.
[9284.68s -> 9287.20s]  That guy just, I'm glad I did that quest,
[9287.20s -> 9291.12s]  whatever that was.
[9291.12s -> 9297.72s]  Nerve cluster, nerve, liver, soul, lung.
[9297.72s -> 9307.15s]  Nerve, liver, soul, lung, lung.
[9307.15s -> 9314.52s]  Nerve, brain, rock cane.
[9314.52s -> 9322.48s]  It's expensive though.
[9322.48s -> 9323.76s]  Oh, fuck.
[9323.76s -> 9326.56s]  You, I know you want a brain, and I have it right now.
[9328.75s -> 9331.49s]  Oh, okay.
[9331.49s -> 9332.33s]  No longer broke?
[9332.33s -> 9333.17s]  No, not anymore.
[9333.17s -> 9335.17s]  Now I can invest a bunch of money into the stock market.
[9335.17s -> 9336.49s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[9336.49s -> 9338.73s]  Oh, oh, oh, look at that, oh, oh, oh.
[9338.73s -> 9340.13s]  It's capped at six, Jerma.
[9340.13s -> 9342.44s]  Oh yeah?
[9342.44s -> 9343.88s]  Time to cash out.
[9343.88s -> 9344.72s]  Hell yeah.
[9344.72s -> 9355.50s]  It's 45,000 more dollars.
[9355.50s -> 9359.66s]  I got almost 100 ring.
[9359.66s -> 9362.73s]  It doesn't cap at six.
[9362.73s -> 9363.57s]  Oh, that's huge.
[9363.61s -> 9370.36s]  I just had two big things happen there.
[9370.36s -> 9371.40s]  Oh man.
[9371.40s -> 9373.08s]  Everything is all the way up here.
[9373.08s -> 9374.00s]  I gotta wait for it.
[9374.00s -> 9378.95s]  This is gonna be a pullback here.
[9378.95s -> 9380.47s]  Will I just get the better one,
[9380.47s -> 9384.60s]  or do I hold onto the money and invest?
[9384.60s -> 9393.27s]  What do you think?
[9393.27s -> 9398.64s]  Cause this will give me 14 spaces.
[9398.64s -> 9402.24s]  Yeah, if I got the money, I'm gonna use it.
[9402.24s -> 9404.52s]  Okay, so what, allow you to carry more cargo,
[9404.52s -> 9406.72s]  but leave a precious thin shell between your organs
[9406.72s -> 9410.40s]  and the horrors of space increases the organ decay rate.
[9413.25s -> 9419.88s]  Okay, that's all right.
[9420.76s -> 9421.60s]  What do I have in my cargo?
[9421.60s -> 9423.87s]  I've got two livers.
[9423.87s -> 9427.62s]  Nobody wants a shitty liver.
[9427.62s -> 9433.20s]  I need lungs, lungs, soul, nerve cluster.
[9433.20s -> 9440.84s]  Lungs, soul, nerve cluster, let's go.
[9440.84s -> 9446.36s]  Here it is, lungs.
[9446.36s -> 9448.76s]  Ah, it was expensive, but it's okay.
[9448.76s -> 9450.91s]  I'll get another one.
[9450.91s -> 9456.64s]  I got money.
[9456.64s -> 9458.82s]  Nerve.
[9458.82s -> 9466.44s]  I'll get another one.
[9466.44s -> 9471.56s]  I need four souls.
[9471.56s -> 9475.41s]  I'll get another one.
[9475.41s -> 9480.59s]  I'll get another one.
[9480.59s -> 9486.00s]  Lungs, do I still need lungs?
[9486.00s -> 9488.24s]  Nerve cluster and I need, okay.
[9488.28s -> 9491.88s]  Boom.
[9491.88s -> 9492.80s]  Hell yeah.
[9492.80s -> 9494.57s]  I got new organs.
[9494.57s -> 9498.68s]  11,000 bucks, are you kidding me?
[9498.68s -> 9501.44s]  Oh, I said that if you mix a large shard into the soul,
[9501.44s -> 9503.28s]  you'll, it would make them crop.
[9503.28s -> 9504.44s]  Oh, a shard?
[9504.44s -> 9507.92s]  You got it.
[9507.92s -> 9509.44s]  Shard, two shards.
[9509.44s -> 9512.92s]  Oh boy, look at this money.
[9512.92s -> 9519.91s]  Two shards, lungs, heart, two shards.
[9519.91s -> 9521.43s]  I need a song.
[9521.43s -> 9524.04s]  Let's get it, let's get a good song here.
[9524.04s -> 9534.18s]  Heart, lung, heart, lung, shard, shard, nerve.
[9534.18s -> 9535.58s]  Heart, lung, shard, shard, nerve.
[9535.58s -> 9537.98s]  Heart, heart, heart, heart, shard.
[9537.98s -> 9540.75s]  I don't know what's wrong with my brain.
[9540.75s -> 9542.44s]  I forgot the whole thing.
[9542.44s -> 9550.53s]  Heart, heart, lung, lung, lung, shard.
[9552.55s -> 9554.89s]  Lung, shard, shard, heart.
[9554.89s -> 9562.04s]  Lung, shard, shard, heart, nerve.
[9562.04s -> 9566.18s]  Let's do it again.
[9566.18s -> 9571.29s]  Shard, shard, heart, nerve.
[9571.29s -> 9574.44s]  Take a half of it already, here we go.
[9574.44s -> 9578.32s]  One of these was done, this one.
[9578.32s -> 9579.16s]  This one too.
[9580.93s -> 9584.86s]  I have, I got two hearts.
[9584.86s -> 9590.76s]  Oh shit, I'm so slow.
[9590.76s -> 9602.40s]  Market's still going crazy.
[9602.40s -> 9607.13s]  Still at nine, okay.
[9607.13s -> 9608.41s]  Are you an organ donor?
[9608.41s -> 9614.01s]  I'm an organ trader.
[9614.01s -> 9618.58s]  I have to get rid of this, it's been here for too long.
[9618.58s -> 9621.17s]  Hearts are really useful though.
[9621.17s -> 9623.89s]  If you get a new stock, everything is just way too high.
[9623.89s -> 9624.97s]  Look at the market, it's crazy.
[9624.97s -> 9629.63s]  I need to wait like another few days.
[9629.63s -> 9634.81s]  Everything's going wild.
[9634.81s -> 9640.68s]  I need lungs and I need shards.
[9640.68s -> 9643.00s]  Lung, shard, lung and two shards
[9643.00s -> 9649.68s]  and that's a shitload of money.
[9649.68s -> 9652.88s]  Three shards.
[9652.88s -> 9655.60s]  You're buying organs from a hunter of flesh cryptids
[9655.60s -> 9656.56s]  and the organs are normal?
[9656.56s -> 9658.52s]  That's an unlicensed harvester, idiot.
[9658.52s -> 9659.76s]  He's hunting people.
[9663.93s -> 9667.01s]  I literally have no idea what you just told me.
[9667.01s -> 9668.57s]  All right, I need a bunch of shards.
[9668.57s -> 9670.73s]  Gotta get them cheap.
[9670.73s -> 9673.56s]  That lung is way too high.
[9673.56s -> 9676.96s]  Dude, is this, oh my God, look at the heart increase.
[9676.96s -> 9681.00s]  Let's go.
[9681.00s -> 9687.97s]  All right, shards.
[9687.97s -> 9693.54s]  I'm not seeing shards right now.
[9693.58s -> 9700.74s]  Shards, lungs, shards, lungs.
[9700.74s -> 9707.76s]  Oh man, come on.
[9707.76s -> 9709.88s]  Finally, that's just 4,300 bucks.
[9709.88s -> 9711.08s]  It better be worth it.
[9711.08s -> 9714.00s]  It is.
[9714.00s -> 9722.28s]  Soul, I'm gonna buy it because it's cheap.
[9722.28s -> 9726.87s]  Shards, I get common, no.
[9726.87s -> 9728.19s]  Remember, buy a penis.
[9732.71s -> 9734.43s]  I just realized I've been like leaning forward
[9734.43s -> 9738.28s]  this whole time.
[9738.28s -> 9742.76s]  All right, anybody else need anything that I can get?
[9742.76s -> 9745.36s]  What lungs?
[9745.36s -> 9746.96s]  I'm so sorry.
[9746.96s -> 9747.96s]  They found me.
[9747.96s -> 9749.52s]  There's too much money in organs
[9749.56s -> 9750.96s]  and they hurt me.
[9750.96s -> 9753.80s]  Oh God, I told them about the lab.
[9753.80s -> 9756.44s]  Only send a gallbladder if I'm worth saving.
[9756.44s -> 9759.45s]  Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow.
[9762.42s -> 9764.51s]  I need shards.
[9764.51s -> 9773.52s]  I got that lung.
[9773.52s -> 9781.12s]  All right, send a gallbladder.
[9781.12s -> 9781.96s]  Just saw one.
[9781.96s -> 9784.72s]  All right, here, take the gallbladder.
[9784.72s -> 9790.68s]  Be saved.
[9790.68s -> 9793.06s]  Mutual fabrication.
[9793.06s -> 9795.02s]  You asked for something exceptional
[9795.02s -> 9797.18s]  and I think I know of a way to deliver.
[9797.18s -> 9799.46s]  Send over an average shard when you get a chance.
[9799.46s -> 9801.34s]  I've got some cutting to do.
[9801.34s -> 9804.18s]  All right.
[9804.18s -> 9808.60s]  Oh shit.
[9808.60s -> 9817.72s]  Market's still at all time high, come on.
[9817.72s -> 9821.92s]  Still have the soul.
[9821.92s -> 9823.60s]  This thing is, look at how good this is.
[9823.60s -> 9825.96s]  It's a gigantic valuable liver
[9825.96s -> 9831.11s]  and it's pretty decent condition.
[9831.11s -> 9835.84s]  I gotta lean forward here.
[9835.84s -> 9836.68s]  They found me.
[9836.68s -> 9838.64s]  Send your credit card if I'm worth saving.
[9843.48s -> 9847.57s]  I have money to spend, but I don't wanna use it.
[9847.57s -> 9849.48s]  All right.
[9849.48s -> 9850.92s]  Average, we need shard.
[9850.92s -> 9854.85s]  I just need a bunch of shards.
[9855.09s -> 9862.72s]  Big leech lymph and just shards, shards, shards, shards.
[9862.72s -> 9863.96s]  Shards, large shard.
[9863.96s -> 9872.37s]  I just said, give me shards.
[9872.37s -> 9874.73s]  No, shards, they're so valuable.
[9874.73s -> 9876.69s]  Come on, soul.
[9876.69s -> 9879.75s]  I'm gonna hold onto the souls though.
[9879.75s -> 9885.12s]  Like, okay, I do some organ harvesting.
[9885.12s -> 9886.92s]  I'm meeting a demand of the marketplace.
[9886.92s -> 9888.08s]  I take care of my family.
[9888.08s -> 9890.52s]  Don't judge me.
[9890.52s -> 9892.32s]  Whatever.
[9892.32s -> 9893.16s]  I'm gonna get a bladder too.
[9893.16s -> 9894.00s]  This always come up.
[9894.00s -> 9895.86s]  Shard.
[9895.86s -> 9905.75s]  Just bought, insta-buy any shard I see, no matter what.
[9906.03s -> 9907.23s]  He just wanted any shard, right?
[9907.23s -> 9912.20s]  That's 11 grand.
[9912.20s -> 9915.00s]  Shot.
[9915.00s -> 9921.85s]  He's pissed.
[9921.85s -> 9926.64s]  Ooh.
[9926.64s -> 9927.60s]  Okay, here we go.
[9927.60s -> 9929.88s]  Send an average shard when you get a chance.
[9929.88s -> 9931.75s]  Is that what I got?
[9931.75s -> 9933.35s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[9933.35s -> 9934.39s]  7,500 bucks.
[9934.39s -> 9935.99s]  Look at the reputation I'm gonna get for this.
[9935.99s -> 9939.10s]  You kidding me?
[9939.10s -> 9952.79s]  Holy, what'd I do?
[9952.79s -> 9954.55s]  Unwrapping the package from Breckridge,
[9954.55s -> 9959.40s]  a pale ichor clings to your fingers.
[9959.40s -> 9962.80s]  It's a painted canvas, wet to the touch.
[9962.80s -> 9965.00s]  And in its muscular pulse,
[9965.04s -> 9971.64s]  you recognize the form of Mentor Minter is really the power.
[9971.64s -> 9973.88s]  Mentor was dangerous.
[9973.88s -> 9977.08s]  He was conniving and brilliant and petty
[9977.08s -> 9979.36s]  and eternally striving for goals
[9979.36s -> 9985.95s]  he would never allow himself to reach.
[9985.95s -> 9989.54s]  He hoped you assumed his best qualities
[9989.54s -> 9995.20s]  and avoided his worst ones.
[9995.20s -> 9996.86s]  It's no matter now.
[9996.86s -> 10000.26s]  You hang Mentor's stylish refurbished remains
[10000.26s -> 10006.33s]  on the wall of your office.
[10006.33s -> 10008.25s]  Mentor Minter is dead.
[10008.25s -> 10010.96s]  His threats die with him.
[10010.96s -> 10014.72s]  And if there's anything else you need to learn,
[10014.72s -> 10022.05s]  well, he's always around.
[10022.05s -> 10024.40s]  What?
[10024.40s -> 10026.60s]  Wait, did I just win?
[10026.60s -> 10031.65s]  Wait, what just happened?
[10031.65s -> 10039.12s]  Did I just lose?
[10039.12s -> 10042.88s]  I peeped the horror and died.
[10042.88s -> 10044.60s]  I peeped the horror and lost.
[10044.60s -> 10047.92s]  I think that's a bad end.
[10047.92s -> 10055.68s]  Holy shit, what?
[10055.68s -> 10060.97s]  Wow.
[10060.97s -> 10062.69s]  So there are endings?
[10062.69s -> 10071.94s]  How many endings are in the game, I wonder?
[10071.94s -> 10075.92s]  I concluded one of the storylines.
[10075.92s -> 10078.36s]  Reputation points, organs touched, request fulfilled,
[10078.36s -> 10081.94s]  your organs value.
[10081.94s -> 10083.98s]  Okay.
[10083.98s -> 10088.02s]  More endings await.
[10088.02s -> 10089.50s]  Oh, okay.
[10089.50s -> 10093.14s]  So that's one of the endings.
[10093.14s -> 10098.37s]  Shit.
[10098.37s -> 10103.98s]  Wait, I can just keep...
[10103.98s -> 10106.86s]  Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[10106.86s -> 10108.70s]  You had a conclusive impact on this universe.
[10108.70s -> 10114.16s]  Returning will permanently reverse that outcome.
[10114.16s -> 10118.41s]  I kind of want to keep going.
[10118.41s -> 10125.86s]  I don't think I want to start over.
[10125.86s -> 10130.08s]  Yeah, let's go.
[10130.08s -> 10131.32s]  I will lose that ending.
[10131.32s -> 10135.72s]  Well, that's all right.
[10135.72s -> 10138.54s]  What about the coin game update?
[10138.54s -> 10139.94s]  Oh, wait, there was a, what do you mean?
[10139.94s -> 10140.78s]  You mean for real?
[10140.78s -> 10147.55s]  There was a coin game update and it was real?
[10147.59s -> 10150.52s]  Did they add a bunch of stuff?
[10150.52s -> 10152.04s]  No, I'm going to keep going.
[10152.04s -> 10153.92s]  This game's awesome.
[10153.92s -> 10154.84s]  Yeah, I'm keeping going.
[10154.84s -> 10156.68s]  This is fun.
[10156.68s -> 10161.20s]  I'm not done with this yet.
[10161.20s -> 10162.36s]  Market fucking tanked as well.
[10162.36s -> 10163.20s]  Perfect.
[10163.20s -> 10171.12s]  Wait, no, it didn't.
[10171.12s -> 10173.03s]  Where did I leave off?
[10173.03s -> 10175.11s]  30, what was the last thing that happened?
[10175.11s -> 10178.16s]  Okay, so this is just like kind of the next day.
[10178.16s -> 10182.76s]  Yeah, I'm having fun.
[10182.76s -> 10185.20s]  Was a holiday update to coin game?
[10185.20s -> 10186.04s]  Well, we'll see.
[10186.04s -> 10187.04s]  I kind of want to play for a little bit longer.
[10187.04s -> 10190.35s]  This game is actually really fun.
[10190.35s -> 10191.47s]  This game is really good.
[10191.47s -> 10194.36s]  Highly recommend.
[10194.36s -> 10195.76s]  I want to like keep buying stuff.
[10195.76s -> 10197.52s]  It's just scratching itches in my brain.
[10197.52s -> 10200.32s]  All right, I got souls.
[10200.32s -> 10203.12s]  I need to, what do I have to fulfill here?
[10203.12s -> 10207.39s]  I need that gigantic leech.
[10207.39s -> 10220.70s]  I need shard, large shard.
[10220.70s -> 10221.74s]  This is not the one I just did, right?
[10221.74s -> 10223.06s]  No, I'm dying.
[10223.06s -> 10223.98s]  I need a brain, right?
[10223.98s -> 10227.64s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[10227.64s -> 10231.79s]  What do I need, need, need, need, need, need, need, need?
[10231.79s -> 10236.17s]  Lung, lung?
[10236.17s -> 10237.09s]  Now we may speak privately.
[10237.09s -> 10239.81s]  The dark emperor, Zimforth, has slept for far too long
[10239.81s -> 10241.41s]  to breathe life back into this corpse.
[10241.41s -> 10244.98s]  Gigantic lungs, lungs, lungs.
[10245.02s -> 10251.58s]  Leech length, shards, shards.
[10251.58s -> 10262.92s]  I need big lungs, shards.
[10262.92s -> 10270.00s]  Leech, I think I can fulfill one, yeah, there you go.
[10270.00s -> 10271.20s]  Hell yeah.
[10271.20s -> 10275.07s]  All right, I need a large, large shard.
[10275.07s -> 10281.40s]  Gigantic lungs, lungs.
[10281.40s -> 10283.84s]  Oh, damn it, I don't know what I bought.
[10286.15s -> 10291.21s]  Large shard, fuck, what do I have?
[10291.21s -> 10294.72s]  Soul, I need a gigantic soul.
[10294.72s -> 10297.80s]  Average lungs, I need big, wait, let me get this right.
[10297.80s -> 10299.51s]  Got that one already.
[10299.51s -> 10311.52s]  Gigantic lungs, gigantic leech, large shard.
[10311.52s -> 10321.44s]  No, gimme that, gimme that, I don't even know what it was.
[10321.44s -> 10322.40s]  Why are these so expensive?
[10322.40s -> 10329.40s]  Oh, because they're mythic, okay.
[10329.40s -> 10333.08s]  You are a servant, play coin game.
[10333.08s -> 10335.24s]  I will play coin game today.
[10335.24s -> 10343.19s]  Just sit back and relax.
[10343.19s -> 10344.80s]  That's a good buy.
[10344.80s -> 10361.36s]  19,000, what are you talking about?
[10361.36s -> 10366.96s]  I need gigantic stuff, who are you?
[10366.96s -> 10370.16s]  I think it's time to buy some stocks.
[10370.16s -> 10372.96s]  I'm gonna buy stocks in, not stomach.
[10374.04s -> 10388.28s]  Something expensive, platter, earworms,
[10388.28s -> 10396.40s]  eye-roids, little Joey's heart.
[10396.40s -> 10407.07s]  I just bought one, is that a good idea?
[10407.07s -> 10410.93s]  I could sell a lot of this right now and make some money.
[10410.93s -> 10420.04s]  But I'm gonna hold them.
[10420.04s -> 10425.17s]  All right, let's go, I've got shard, bingo.
[10425.17s -> 10427.81s]  You need big, all these weird specific shit things,
[10427.81s -> 10431.60s]  you know what I mean, large shard.
[10431.60s -> 10438.93s]  Large shard, gigantic leech, gigantic lungs, hearts.
[10440.48s -> 10445.93s]  No, got it.
[10445.93s -> 10456.19s]  Okay, that's the quest.
[10456.19s -> 10461.70s]  I'm gonna get a couple more of these.
[10461.70s -> 10463.34s]  All right, let's get something going here.
[10463.34s -> 10465.56s]  Old little Joey's heart, I will.
[10465.56s -> 10466.52s]  Good platter.
[10469.25s -> 10471.42s]  What?
[10471.42s -> 10472.98s]  I can stop coming around if you want.
[10472.98s -> 10474.62s]  I know what I do ain't kind.
[10474.62s -> 10478.33s]  Sign this release and you won't see my hide ever again.
[10478.33s -> 10481.17s]  No, you gave me a brain that was worth $20,000.
[10481.17s -> 10484.58s]  Keep coming back.
[10484.58s -> 10486.30s]  All right, heart, I need hearts.
[10486.30s -> 10490.93s]  Large hearts, large shit, whatever it was.
[10494.96s -> 10496.68s]  Gigantic shard, right?
[10496.68s -> 10502.72s]  I don't remember, fuck me.
[10502.72s -> 10509.93s]  Large shard, gigantic leech, gigantic lung,
[10509.93s -> 10514.37s]  large shard, gigantic leech.
[10514.37s -> 10518.95s]  What does the leech even look like?
[10518.95s -> 10527.66s]  What does it look like?
[10527.66s -> 10533.53s]  Large shard, gigantic leech, too expensive.
[10533.53s -> 10540.12s]  I'll buy the stomach though, it's cheap and horrible.
[10540.12s -> 10553.30s]  Dude, these are expensive, just start selling them now.
[10553.30s -> 10554.50s]  Free up the space.
[10554.50s -> 10557.89s]  I gotta do something, I gotta get this out going here.
[10557.89s -> 10560.98s]  Leech is 20.
[10560.98s -> 10563.34s]  Oh, here it is, okay, okay, I need gigantic leech.
[10567.78s -> 10570.54s]  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[10570.54s -> 10576.12s]  Large shard, hell yeah, who wanted that?
[10576.12s -> 10581.37s]  You did, that's 11 grand, hell yeah.
[10581.37s -> 10585.66s]  Dude, little Joey's heart.
[10585.66s -> 10586.98s]  Yeah, if you wanna vote,
[10586.98s -> 10589.30s]  the end of the year awards are currently available
[10589.30s -> 10593.57s]  to vote on, the link right now in the chat.
[10593.57s -> 10597.88s]  Go click it, it's 26 categories.
[10597.88s -> 10601.60s]  This, by the way, this stream will be on New Year's Eve,
[10601.60s -> 10608.01s]  not New Year's Day, still planning on doing that.
[10608.05s -> 10610.54s]  So there will be the rumble
[10610.54s -> 10614.32s]  and the awards on New Year's Eve.
[10614.32s -> 10616.20s]  I'm probably gonna start later in the evening
[10616.20s -> 10621.20s]  so I can hit New Year's at least on Eastern time,
[10621.20s -> 10624.36s]  because I know that New Year's on Pacific time
[10624.36s -> 10626.88s]  is way too late for a lot of people.
[10626.88s -> 10630.04s]  So we're going to count down the New Year Eastern time,
[10630.04s -> 10634.24s]  like we do every year anyways.
[10634.24s -> 10637.13s]  So the stream will probably start,
[10637.13s -> 10639.41s]  I'd like to at least go for an hour or two probably
[10639.41s -> 10642.99s]  before the New Year.
[10642.99s -> 10646.92s]  So I imagine you can expect that stream to start
[10646.92s -> 10652.13s]  at maybe seven o'clock, 730 Pacific,
[10652.13s -> 10655.38s]  starting somewhere around like 10, 1030 Eastern.
[10655.38s -> 10656.94s]  Then we'll be able to go for an hour or two,
[10656.94s -> 10659.58s]  say, oh look, happy New Year, we hit the New Year.
[10659.58s -> 10662.57s]  And then go for like another hour or two,
[10662.57s -> 10665.88s]  just like we did last time.
[10665.88s -> 10670.53s]  But let's keep going.
[10670.53s -> 10679.32s]  Good bladder, I did a large shard,
[10679.32s -> 10683.90s]  gigantic leech, just a lung,
[10683.90s -> 10692.14s]  gigantic leech, lung, good bladder.
[10692.14s -> 10695.67s]  Yo, got it.
[10695.71s -> 10702.13s]  Good bladder, gigantic leech, that's too expensive.
[10702.13s -> 10705.83s]  Thank you.
[10705.83s -> 10707.75s]  Whoa, I know I'm just an organ harvester
[10707.75s -> 10709.07s]  and you're a big old organ trader,
[10709.07s -> 10712.87s]  but are we friends, is that what we are?
[10712.87s -> 10717.33s]  I don't know what to say to this guy.
[10717.33s -> 10719.76s]  Did I say no?
[10719.76s -> 10725.29s]  I feel like I have to say yes, sure.
[10725.29s -> 10727.41s]  Okay, already I see a dark blush of life flooding
[10727.41s -> 10728.61s]  into Zimforth's cheeks,
[10728.61s -> 10730.93s]  give him the large eyes he deserves.
[10730.93s -> 10733.66s]  Are we building a person?
[10733.66s -> 10737.65s]  Okay, large eyes, we're making a person.
[10744.67s -> 10747.11s]  All right, let's see what I want.
[10747.11s -> 10753.48s]  Cormix, Cormix, nerve, big eyes,
[10753.48s -> 10767.41s]  Cormix, nerve, big eyes, Cormix, shit.
[10767.41s -> 10770.12s]  You're building a demon?
[10770.12s -> 10777.84s]  Jesus, anybody else want anything?
[10777.84s -> 10783.85s]  Ladder, lung, just any lung?
[10783.85s -> 10786.32s]  Wait, what does it have to be big?
[10786.32s -> 10794.10s]  No, just lungs, buy that soul.
[10794.10s -> 10802.85s]  Cormix, running out of time, there we go.
[10808.12s -> 10814.10s]  Hey guys, these are gigantic, does that matter?
[10814.10s -> 10816.86s]  No, they have to be large eyes, okay.
[10816.86s -> 10829.16s]  What, I didn't need to eat Cormix.
[10829.16s -> 10838.90s]  Tiny eyes, I should have bought that, idiot.
[10838.90s -> 10849.66s]  I'm buying the mythic shard, who wanted that?
[10849.66s -> 10860.89s]  Oh, I just, that was a bad trade, that's a bad trade.
[10860.89s -> 10864.81s]  Yeah, why would I ever sell this to this guy for 3,000?
[10864.81s -> 10878.59s]  That's a bad trade, I'm gonna hold this stuff.
[10878.59s -> 10884.15s]  Oh shit, nice, I'm up 30% on this shit.
[10889.47s -> 10897.79s]  Hey for the funny eyeball man, big eyes.
[10897.79s -> 10904.40s]  Let's just keep going, hurry up.
[10904.40s -> 10907.60s]  All right, my ADHD is freaking out right now.
[10907.60s -> 10913.73s]  I need a Cormix, Cormix, nerve, large eyes, ladder.
[10915.49s -> 10918.57s]  Cormix, nerve, large eyes, nope,
[10918.57s -> 10922.75s]  Cormix, nerve, large eyes, ladder.
[10922.75s -> 10926.77s]  Is it above or below, I don't remember.
[10926.77s -> 10933.96s]  Organ barges are again operational, does that mean?
[10933.96s -> 10937.32s]  Large eyes, yep, here you go, go make the guy.
[10943.54s -> 10953.75s]  Brain, Cormix, gallbladder, casino has been
[10953.75s -> 10955.35s]  approved for the harvest, leech limb.
[10955.35s -> 10957.49s]  All right, let's do these.
[10957.49s -> 10961.39s]  Can I have one of these?
[10961.39s -> 10967.02s]  Okay, liver, gallbladder, double E, Cormix.
[10967.02s -> 10969.90s]  Liver, gallbladder, double E, Cormix, brain.
[10969.90s -> 10971.46s]  Thanks for the fucking 10 grand.
[10974.84s -> 10984.64s]  Liver, gallbladder, double E, Cormix.
[10984.92s -> 10997.50s]  One of these, forget, how much does this thing worth?
[10997.50s -> 11007.28s]  This is kind of depreciating.
[11007.28s -> 11015.05s]  All right, I need E-Cormixes immediately.
[11015.05s -> 11017.09s]  Hi chat, the dev said your money will transfer
[11017.09s -> 11020.77s]  from this game to coin game with a new update.
[11025.50s -> 11034.42s]  That was pretty good, that was really good.
[11034.42s -> 11039.36s]  No E-Cormixes, this sucks.
[11039.36s -> 11051.16s]  Oh, I think these are all E-Cormixes and a nerve cluster.
[11054.44s -> 11059.52s]  I think I'm gonna sell Joey's heart, 25%.
[11059.52s -> 11066.24s]  That's a lot of money, I don't wanna lose it.
[11066.24s -> 11071.65s]  I got this, I hope this appreciates too.
[11071.65s -> 11073.33s]  Ain't just surrounding organs in the,
[11073.33s -> 11075.60s]  okay, wait, wait, I wanna do this.
[11075.60s -> 11081.96s]  Increase the condition, this thing kind of freaks me out.
[11081.96s -> 11086.48s]  What about the Cormix stocks?
[11086.48s -> 11092.62s]  How are they doing right now?
[11092.62s -> 11099.84s]  Dude, this is way too expensive.
[11099.84s -> 11101.20s]  We're almost done with this, there's an ooze
[11101.20s -> 11103.48s]  trickling from the corpse of our mutual master.
[11103.48s -> 11111.42s]  Bring me the best valuable kidney you can find.
