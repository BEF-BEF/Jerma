[1.14s -> 11.64s]  VOD Watchers, I'm so glad I caught you this early. At one minute and- I'll shut up. What's
[11.64s -> 19.35s]  going on everybody? How you doing? Good morning. I'm not doing it again. No, I was- I- that was for
[19.35s -> 36.22s]  you guys to get really annoyed with. What if you have not finished the other VOD? Well, just save
[36.22s -> 46.84s]  them. Just save them for a rainy day. Why am I live right now? I'm like a- I'm a couple hours
[46.84s -> 62.65s]  early than typical, than usual. There are some new emotes. Some that I ripped from better uh,
[62.65s -> 78.86s]  Twitch TV. And some that are new. Hey, remember that emote that I said was going to be here?
[78.86s -> 87.08s]  Just about a year and two months ago? Well, I- there it is. Dermathing. Remember when I played
[87.08s -> 91.72s]  the thing last weekend? Wasn't that a really funny stream? It was- we had a bunch of fun.
[96.62s -> 117.32s]  Why are people getting banned? Too early. Too early. Leave. No, I'm- I'm not leaving. I remember
[117.32s -> 136.22s]  that like it was yesterday. Uh, dude. Okay, it was- uh, yes, it was yesterday. Are you all right?
[136.22s -> 141.37s]  Yeah, there's a look of me. There's also- I don't know why I enabled it, but there's also me ripping
[141.37s -> 150.98s]  a t-shirt off. Somebody's linked it and said, hey dude, enable this! Okay. When you guys get me
[151.54s -> 157.59s]  in one of those days where I'm incredibly impressionable, I'll just- I'll do anything.
[159.67s -> 162.87s]  I activated like five new emotes yesterday just because it was like, yeah, okay,
[162.95s -> 177.35s]  people told me to- yeah, I'll turn this one on. We're going to do more. Battle for Bikini Bottom
[177.35s -> 185.16s]  Rehydrated. And speaking of being hydrated, okay, let's do the complete opposite and drink a coffee.
[185.72s -> 194.07s]  Let's shrivel up. It's early though. It's like, oh, it's not even 10 o'clock in the morning.
[199.99s -> 207.67s]  Yeah, hydrate bot. Where's- where's shrivel bot? Where's the thing that says, hey, you haven't
[207.67s -> 217.13s]  drank water in over four hours? Don't do it! Turn to dust. What's today's sponsor? I don't
[217.13s -> 229.72s]  have sponsors. What are you talking about? I've been trying to drink more water. Trying to stay
[229.72s -> 238.18s]  more hydrated. You know, for a while I had an app on my phone that told me when to drink water.
[240.15s -> 247.43s]  I'm not kidding. I downloaded an app that told me when to drink water. It was a notification when
[247.43s -> 252.87s]  ding! Actually, that's a lie. It went like bloop! They made like this cool water sound. Like,
[253.75s -> 260.95s]  it's like, hey, it's time to drink! And the thing just got annoying because, you know,
[260.95s -> 270.04s]  you're supposed to drink like eight to ten glasses of water a day. Getting 10 notifications
[270.04s -> 279.72s]  a day is too much for me. Getting three notifications a day on my phone is too much for me.
[279.72s -> 293.26s]  Drink a pool. How many times have you guys had an app that gave you notifications that within
[293.26s -> 298.14s]  one time of it happening you went, nah, I'm fucking deleting this. I don't want this.
[298.70s -> 303.42s]  Because you were like in the middle of like- you were in the middle of like reading a newspaper
[303.42s -> 306.70s]  or something or you were in the middle of like a game or something like that and it just annoyed
[306.70s -> 312.34s]  you. No, whatever that is, turn it off. I never want to hear it again. It's like, well, I did that.
[312.34s -> 322.15s]  I wanted that. Oh, yeah. Notification. Yeah, that'd be cool. It'll notify me of something important.
[323.53s -> 327.29s]  Don't fucking do that ever again. Give me the phone. Give the fucking thing to me.
[327.29s -> 330.81s]  Where's the- there it is. Don't ever do that again, motherfucker.
[331.61s -> 348.07s]  What's wrong with humans? Why are we like this? The term of punching. I feel like that's going to
[348.07s -> 359.94s]  be used in a good way. Term of punching is a thing. Yeah, better Twitch TV. I got a hundred
[359.94s -> 370.06s]  dollars from KXZ. Thank you KXZ for the fucking hundred bucks. It's good to be back. Thank you.
[372.34s -> 382.62s]  That's 100 bucks. Derma Wild 2. Yeah, Derma Wild 2 is there. I didn't enable one or three. I just
[382.62s -> 401.61s]  did two. It's scary. Why not Derma Psycho? I don't know. Why do I have two? Wait, hold on a minute.
[404.73s -> 412.07s]  Why is there a save file here with 30 spatulas at 5 PM? And why is there one at 6 PM? Why is there
[412.07s -> 428.95s]  one a full hour later? This is an autosave. Did I- how long was this open? Which one's the real one?
[428.95s -> 439.88s]  I should do the one that was later, right? Wait, did I end the stream and just leave it at this
[439.88s -> 444.70s]  screen and just go like fuck off and eat? And then come back in an hour and go, oh,
[445.82s -> 453.14s]  this is definitely what happened. Well, welcome back to Bikini Bottom, guys. I'm your host.
[453.14s -> 460.33s]  All right. I won't do that this early. It's too early for that. It's too early to be a dickhead.
[460.33s -> 465.26s]  You know what I mean? Somebody knows what I mean. It's too early for like the- yeah, it is. All
[465.26s -> 469.18s]  right. What was the- where was I? Oh, Gula Good. Somebody said to go here because they said this
[469.18s -> 494.62s]  is a cool park. Sorry. Oh, this does look cool. I love the beach. It's the only thing I miss in
[494.62s -> 506.17s]  Vegas. No beach. You can use the bubble bash to move things. Okay. It's just- it's not the same.
[506.17s -> 522.58s]  There's no beach. What about Lake Mead? I'm not going to Lake Mead? What do you mean Lake Mead?
[526.17s -> 530.57s]  Lake Mead is like- there's like- isn't there like stores? Isn't there like a bunch of fucking dead
[530.57s -> 544.09s]  animals and like dead bodies in there and stuff? I don't want to go in there. It's true. I don't
[544.09s -> 552.98s]  know what the hell- I don't want to go into Lake Mead. The game's quiet. I'll turn it up.
[552.98s -> 564.31s]  This robot is called Monsoon. Watch out for his lightning attack. Can I kill him? One hit. One hit.
[564.95s -> 573.77s]  That was a farting and screaming compilation. What happened? What happened? What? What happened?
[575.19s -> 596.49s]  Wait, that's goo. Oh, okay. You can't even touch it? I mean, I understand if it goes above the waste,
[596.49s -> 603.77s]  right? But I can't even touch this shit. Oh, hey Larry. Do you look burned?
[619.11s -> 622.31s]  What's that mean in French? Oh my god, right? Oh my gosh.
[624.52s -> 629.64s]  Exactly. You can't spend a day at the beach without sunscreen. That sun is way too hot.
[629.64s -> 634.76s]  That means eat my ass in French. No, it doesn't. That robot is out on the island.
[634.76s -> 644.12s]  Nobody can get to him. What? Isn't there a song? Oh, eat my ass. What is this? How on earth could I
[644.12s -> 650.12s]  have missed such a sweet little succulent crab? What are you talking about? That would not be in
[650.12s -> 660.07s]  that Joe movie. SpongeBob, maybe you can use those sun reflectors to point the sun rays on that
[660.07s -> 668.86s]  robot. All right, let me pay attention. I need to pay attention to the game. If you can use the sun
[668.86s -> 674.81s]  reflectors. If you hit one of the buttons on the side of a lifeguard tower, the reflector will turn.
[675.61s -> 680.17s]  Connect all the towers and the light will shoot right out of the big reflector on the island.
[680.17s -> 684.81s]  This is pretty cool. Then all you have to do is swim out to the island and turn the big reflector
[685.37s -> 692.33s]  onto the real and live. Yeah, this is yeah, I'll stay here and protect the babes, but I can't swim.
[693.37s -> 698.23s]  Yes, how am I supposed to do this? And any of the character can like sandy swim.
[699.83s -> 717.14s]  All right, where's the first beam? All right, right here. First beam going. Push, push, push,
[717.14s -> 738.92s]  push, push. What are you talking about? Push, push. Who am I pushing? No, that's that's wrong.
[738.92s -> 747.86s]  It's gotta go this way. Like push the button. Yeah. Oh, I thought you meant. I thought you were like
[747.86s -> 751.94s]  push the thing out of the way, like move it, like turn it. Come on. I can't make that jump.
[757.58s -> 772.50s]  Yes, I can. Just jump better. I am jumping fine. I made it. All right. So what what side do I need
[772.50s -> 789.58s]  to press this one? No, no, no, no, no. Wrong. Okay, we got one, two, and then we got to go
[789.58s -> 797.08s]  from over there. Oh, there's a big cookie monster over there I can jump on. All right, cool.
[799.54s -> 818.84s]  He did it. Wrong. Cross the way. There we go. Okay. But now we go to that one and we got to
[818.84s -> 827.42s]  move it to over here. Imagine if you were at the beach and some pasty dude jumped on your fat belly.
[831.42s -> 836.22s]  All right. This problem. All right. It's probably a guy that has like one of those like bad
[836.22s -> 841.58s]  experiences with like a little kid at the beach where somebody like jumps to dive
[842.14s -> 854.06s]  to pick up like a ball and they just land right on your stomach. All right. Which one's missing?
[854.06s -> 868.30s]  Am I doing this right? What the fuck? No, I'm doing it wrong. I don't know. Aren't they all lit up?
[869.02s -> 889.45s]  Which one is currently being touched? This one to here. Wait, what does this thing say? Why is
[889.45s -> 896.04s]  there a sign here? You can get to the oh from the pier on the other side of the sea caves.
[897.38s -> 914.44s]  Well, shit. In this reach. I just woke up. Hey, good morning. All right. You can get to the pier
[914.44s -> 919.29s]  from the other side of the sea caves or something. Whatever. All right. Let's go. There's one that's
[919.29s -> 924.15s]  going to be lit across the goo lagoon. You won't be able to access it. Well, I got those accessed.
[924.15s -> 931.35s]  I'm ready to move. Somebody screamed because they were just like, dude, he keeps hitting the fucking
[931.35s -> 941.98s]  lightning tombs, whatever they're called. How many spats are just too early to say that word?
[942.62s -> 953.37s]  How many spatulas? That should be. I got to be Patrick for this. Is there a bus stop? I didn't
[953.37s -> 966.20s]  see one. Are you? Are you? No, I'm not even going to answer that. That's like so stupid. No. Just
[966.20s -> 971.08s]  who cares what character I am from Family Guy. I don't care. I'm not going to answer that.
[973.48s -> 979.40s]  Yeah. Hey, dude, I just want to know, are you a Peter or a Chris from Family Guy? Like who cares?
[987.24s -> 990.60s]  Who are you? What are you? That's what I want to know. Who are you?
[991.48s -> 1001.58s]  Mrs. Pops. The children's balloons are carrying the children out of control.
[1001.58s -> 1008.79s]  I don't know, Mrs. Pops. It looks like they're having a lot of fun. Yes, too much fun if you ask me.
[1009.83s -> 1013.27s]  You can save the children by bubble bashing each of the balloons.
[1013.27s -> 1020.49s]  Okay, we're going to save the kids. All right. How many? What are they? Three?
[1022.46s -> 1029.64s]  Five. All right. Let's just look up. One, two, three over here. This game is fun. I like this game.
[1030.36s -> 1038.71s]  You know, I thought this was a racing game since it came out on like the PlayStation 2. I didn't
[1038.71s -> 1048.90s]  know this was this kind of game. I didn't even care to look. You know why? Because most all
[1048.90s -> 1059.83s]  cartoon licensed video games are car racing games. Why is this moving around? So it's like a
[1059.83s -> 1065.03s]  Spongebob battle for Bikini Bottom. It's like a combat cartoon Mario Kart racer. I don't want to
[1065.03s -> 1079.18s]  play it. I don't know why I didn't give it a chance. I hate that you weren't. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How
[1079.18s -> 1084.34s]  wrong you were. Yeah, I know. I didn't know this was like a Banjo Kazooie, but with Spongebob
[1084.34s -> 1091.96s]  characters. That's fucking awesome. Why didn't any of you guys tell me this? Dude, check it out.
[1091.96s -> 1095.32s]  Check out Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom. You'll love it. It's a sick racer. It's an awesome
[1095.32s -> 1102.55s]  racing game. And I'm like, I don't want to play that. What the hell? Oh shit. I didn't know that
[1102.55s -> 1124.17s]  one fell. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. No. Stop obstructing
[1124.17s -> 1134.14s]  my view. All right. Where are the other two? I'm not going to punch it. I promise.
[1139.08s -> 1155.06s]  Local viewer has 3000 viewers screaming. What did I scream? Oh, dirty sock. How many do I have? Nine.
[1155.06s -> 1168.14s]  One more dirty sock. Oh, there's a balloon kid over there. Uh, hold on. Wait, is the chat in
[1168.14s -> 1178.89s]  E mode only? No, it's not. Shit. The chat's not in E mode only mode. Oh no. It's just my chat.
[1179.61s -> 1190.47s]  They're not speaking to each other anymore. They're just communicating in symbols and images.
[1191.03s -> 1203.46s]  All right. Where is he? There's the last two. All right. Bounce up here.
[1208.82s -> 1229.14s]  Oh, I got it. Everybody. That's why it's so loud. Oh, by the way, I saw something the other day
[1229.70s -> 1236.10s]  and it was killing me. I want to play this and I don't know. Am I like a weird narcissist? A weird
[1236.10s -> 1241.94s]  like sicko egomaniac for wanting to play this? I'll show you the video. Hold on. Let me just get a
[1241.94s -> 1256.60s]  spatula. I was fucking laughing. I was like, why is this exist? Somebody made a mod for, uh,
[1257.56s -> 1263.56s]  Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It's my face on the orcs and it's a bunch of random lines from me.
[1266.60s -> 1282.39s]  I was just like, why is this a thing? Hold on here. Look, let's watch this. Play it now. I'm
[1282.39s -> 1291.34s]  gonna, I'm gonna. It's the stupidest fucking thing ever. Like, where did you even get all these sound
[1291.34s -> 1305.93s]  files? Hold on. I gotta scroll down and get it. Sometimes I, yeah, sometimes I peruse the
[1306.01s -> 1309.69s]  gerber reddit and I just check out things that are going on every few weeks or something.
[1310.33s -> 1319.64s]  All right. Here it is. Let's watch this together. This video only has 700 views. What? How?
[1319.64s -> 1414.47s]  Unbelievable. This guy over here. Trash. I'm a fucking monster. Fuck out of here. Fuck you.
[1414.47s -> 1442.63s]  Oh my God, a human. Oh, sorry. This is fucked. Oh, I'm a fucking, I'm a fucking monster.
[1443.35s -> 1450.15s]  Play it, play it. I'll play it. I will. I promise I will at least run around for 20 minutes in this
[1450.15s -> 1466.86s]  mod. Play it now. Oh, I can't play it right now. All right. I got a spatula and then that wouldn't
[1466.86s -> 1474.79s]  even what I was trying to do. No, I want to play SpongeBob right now. I will do that really soon.
[1474.79s -> 1480.97s]  I promise. Beat the game with that mod. I already beat, I already beat that whole game and it was a
[1480.97s -> 1488.39s]  fucking joy. I wish I could just delete that from my brain and like play the whole thing again.
[1489.19s -> 1507.16s]  There's a human over there. Oh my God, a human. Somebody throws ice when I put ice on the ground.
[1507.16s -> 1512.84s]  Oh, so many puked. Well, I didn't do that. That wasn't my gameplay. Why am I saying that was me?
[1514.47s -> 1524.15s]  They didn't go in and edit the video of me playing it. What am I talking about? Can I make it from
[1524.15s -> 1536.89s]  here? She already puked. Okay, I want to go that way. Is that like a little, can I make this jump?
[1537.53s -> 1552.28s]  Shit, I don't think I can. No, what have I done? God damn it. What have I done? You've already been
[1552.28s -> 1560.81s]  there. I want to go across. How do I go across? Is there no way I can go from here to there? Is
[1560.81s -> 1567.59s]  it like a secret way for me to get to the other side of the lagoon over there? Or just go to the
[1567.59s -> 1583.69s]  right? Oh, I'll go that way. Okay. Call Sandy. Yeah, where's that? I need a bus stop. Oh, there's a
[1583.69s -> 1595.82s]  cookie monster. Holy shit. This is a classic Super Mario technique. Hey, look at that. There we go.
[1600.26s -> 1616.86s]  Oh, wait a minute. Get those. Call Sandy. Any opportunity I have to play with Sandy,
[1616.86s -> 1622.55s]  I'm just going to only be Sandy. But not yet. Let's see what a bubble friend says.
[1627.19s -> 1633.67s]  Have you seen one? Why? Yes, we were having a sandcastle contest and somebody put a golden
[1633.67s -> 1640.31s]  spatula on the top. All Sandy she's crying. I'm going to name it Fort Patty town the third
[1640.31s -> 1644.39s]  and Fort Patty town the third would have a big bake sale. Oh, can we talk about the secret
[1644.39s -> 1650.30s]  patty recipe by the way for a quick minute? Why is it so hard to figure out this plankton not know
[1650.30s -> 1658.30s]  what a fucking tomato is? I don't get it. Hey, I don't know. What's the secret formula?
[1659.26s -> 1663.42s]  It's a tomato and onion and some mayonnaise on it. You have you never been to a grocery store
[1663.42s -> 1676.65s]  plankton? Oh, okay. Should I not talk about this? The golden spatula. That should be easy to reach.
[1677.53s -> 1684.01s]  And then it's a crab patty. Perhaps you should see for yourself. Wait, it's a crabby patty. It's
[1684.01s -> 1689.13s]  actually made out of crab. So you tell me this motherfucker Mr. Krabs is running a restaurant
[1689.13s -> 1694.49s]  where he's grinding up his own fucking people and putting them in between hamburger buns.
[1696.57s -> 1708.15s]  Oh, that's kind of weird. Am I really late to this joke? I feel like I am right. I feel
[1708.15s -> 1711.75s]  like there's somebody made like a really funny like, Oh, Mr. Krabs. Can you believe that he's
[1711.75s -> 1717.59s]  makes us out of crabs. I'm like probably 1015 years late to this joke. Yeah, I'm a little
[1717.59s -> 1736.39s]  and the water is rising. Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, it's still going.
[1737.27s -> 1762.31s]  Oh shit. Classic Super Mario technique. Watch it. Oh, very cool checkpoint.
[1764.07s -> 1769.62s]  Cross there. Can I just walk up here and get it?
[1774.04s -> 1776.52s]  They thought about it. They thought about it. You can't do it.
