[309.45s -> 317.64s]  i was just doing oh man you the momentum is so fast this is like walking your grandmother across
[317.64s -> 322.68s]  a fucking road and then now you have to fly an airplane by the way walking your grandmother

[4235.06s -> 4243.54s]  costochondritis which essentially is your rib bones it's just like your rib cage just hurts
[4244.18s -> 4253.06s]  which is that's pretty much what it is that's pretty much it this testicle goes up into your
[4253.38s -> 4263.30s]  stomach uh you need you need to read a few medicine books that's not what that is by the way
[4263.30s -> 4283.54s]  what the fuck am i going i remember i pressed a button here where am i going i don't think i've

[4298.30s -> 4321.24s]  do i just keep moving fast i think probably all right i did it i gotta switch this is the best
[4321.24s -> 4332.97s]  weapon in the game it kills them instantly one hit on these guys and they're dead 120 120 130
[4332.97s -> 4349.82s]  130 140 140 120 120 all right i'm gonna i got 20 of these shots what's next under the button
[4349.82s -> 4367.72s]  oh no uh another elevator tumeric yeah i've kind of been on that train tumeric tease depending on
[4367.72s -> 4375.18s]  if that's really what's going on i might have to go get like an injection i've looked up a bunch
[4375.18s -> 4381.66s]  of stuff that trust me in the last three or four days has been pretty much only me looking up what
[4381.66s -> 4405.96s]  the fuck any of this stuff even means rejection not necessarily no no oh my god who's left
[4407.70s -> 4430.74s]  sequence complete all right wait don't leave anything behind here oh that was it 50 of the
[4430.74s -> 4442.89s]  secrets completed is the bitrate suffering this is the way that the game is encoded into this into
[4442.89s -> 4456.62s]  twitch let me see what's what's it going on right now yeah i'm at six six thousand up i think it
[4456.62s -> 4474.50s]  just looks like that yeah it just looks like that this game is 3d yeah i know it's pretty good
[4477.62s -> 4489.61s]  thanks a lot Jeremy now i have boomer eyes if we are right trust me do you even trust me
[4490.49s -> 4500.09s]  does anybody in this chat actually trust me do you trust me all right so if we if we were
[4500.09s -> 4504.09s]  doing an experiment where i stood behind you and you had to close your eyes and put your hands
[4504.09s -> 4506.97s]  across your chest and fall backwards and i catch you do you think i would catch you
[4524.47s -> 4534.30s]  well i would okay think about it and then i would make a decision how do i get this to go down
[4546.31s -> 4571.61s]  oh shit chaos begets destruction sure did i get him got him too all right i'm gonna go up
[4572.17s -> 4580.78s]  right i'm gonna have to jump around nice dog safer to fall forward yeah but that's not the whole
[4580.78s -> 4584.22s]  point of the test is to see if you trust me that i will catch you if you fall backwards
[4586.30s -> 4589.66s]  why would it actually be safer if you fell forward what if you didn't get caught you'd
[4589.66s -> 4601.40s]  smash your fucking mouth on the ground it's either lose all your teeth or
[4602.12s -> 4617.72s]  smash the back of your head what's worse please just hit me oh fuck i'm gonna die
[4617.72s -> 4624.49s]  no no no no no no no no no no not fall damage i'm fine i need help oh fuck you
[4624.49s -> 4641.98s]  you there's two of these motherfuckers help please thank you i can't reach this
[4641.98s -> 4660.98s]  oh please yes i can all right we're good for now through through through through you
[4662.50s -> 4671.77s]  what are your dicks i bet you have a severe case of gamer neck right now
[4672.65s -> 4679.51s]  no i have to be aware of my gamer neck oh boy what do i do here what do i do here
[4680.23s -> 4690.20s]  i'm gonna use fuck i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead oh no when was last time i saved i don't know
[4690.20s -> 4709.85s]  i have no idea it's been a while i think you know i actually i really do have to be aware of my
[4710.97s -> 4719.18s]  foster and stuff because the more strain i put on my rib cage the worse this can get
[4719.82s -> 4745.27s]  i'm so scared these guys they don't have very much health save it here but i'll tell you it's been a
[4745.27s -> 4752.44s]  real pain in the ass so hopefully over the next few weeks or a couple months or so
[4752.44s -> 4760.68s]  i'll start to figure out ways to alleviate it because damn is really irritating just having
[4760.68s -> 4766.44s]  like a painful all of your ribs just hurt every day like that sucks that's not cool
[4782.17s -> 4785.61s]  originally we thought it was something to do with my intestinal problems but no
[4786.57s -> 4819.80s]  apparently not easy okay one more one more where where where where where is that good
[4820.36s -> 4828.62s]  i think so all right save it somebody fill me on him when he's talking about
[4828.62s -> 4832.38s]  uh all right we'll go we'll break it down a little here all right so like a year ago
[4833.72s -> 4840.04s]  i started to get this weird like back pain it was on the right side of my back and it was kind of
[4840.04s -> 4846.42s]  flanking around the right side of my abdomen what's wrong obviously he went to the doctor
[4847.46s -> 4852.74s]  well i don't know and then my like stomach started to hurt my chest started to hurt too
[4852.74s -> 4857.38s]  like my sternum so my whole abdomen and wrapping around the right side of my back
[4858.26s -> 4862.18s]  just fucking just was hurting all the time i couldn't do anything about it i never turned off
[4862.74s -> 4867.46s]  it never got worse and it never got better so we did colonoscopy maybe it's something to do with
[4867.46s -> 4872.74s]  your uh colitis you have like you've had a irritable bowel disease for pretty much the last 12 years
[4873.46s -> 4879.70s]  maybe it's that nope that's doing just fine well as fine as that can be doing right all right well
[4879.70s -> 4883.22s]  let's try this is test for this test for that test test test test test test test test test
[4883.86s -> 4890.42s]  and then i had a this is three days ago i had an upper endoscopy done with a look at my stomach
[4890.42s -> 4894.58s]  and everything and they said i you have a hernia so it's number one that might be causing it and
[4894.58s -> 4899.38s]  then number two um i think you have this i think it's rib cage i'm like all right you think it's
[4899.38s -> 4904.58s]  my rib cage you sure give me some evidence and he said i don't i don't have any i'm not a doctor
[4905.46s -> 4906.66s]  we're in my garage right now
[4908.81s -> 4929.98s]  and i went oh right right right you're larry kate the hernia is gonna fuck you up pretty bad
[4929.98s -> 4936.46s]  hopefully the rib fucks are false alarm yeah so that just sucks because the if you have a high
[4936.46s -> 4945.58s]  over you your mind's apparently not that bad but it doesn't go away event you just have to like keep
[4945.58s -> 4949.42s]  manage it and keep an eye on it and like change your lifestyle a little bit health more healthy
[4949.42s -> 4955.10s]  eating don't eat before bed and you have to have surgery you have to have like laryngoscopic
[4955.10s -> 4966.02s]  surgery like the damn thing so it's annoying but the it's apparently it's not that serious
[4967.06s -> 4987.03s]  it's just kind of pretty much it i feel like the i know they did it you had a hernia before and
[4987.03s -> 4997.13s]  they were fucking painful yeah it's just how do i get that but i'm not certain about i mean i'm
[4997.13s -> 5001.13s]  certain obviously they did an endoscopy you have a hernia it's like that's the clearest thing
[5003.64s -> 5013.53s]  and the rib cage thing would make sense it just would it just would oh whatever i'm just gonna
[5013.53s -> 5018.89s]  just keep doing keep whatever keep going figure it out is manage it what do i need to do let's
[5018.89s -> 5049.67s]  do that fine all right they feel like it sometimes give me the key creek as you breathe
[5050.87s -> 5055.99s]  like if i lean back and i put my fingers like on my sternum and i like kind of lean back and
[5055.99s -> 5064.81s]  pull all this i'm just kind of following me it's just like oh and i have said to random
[5064.81s -> 5070.65s]  doctors before you know if i just like could pull pick up my rib cage and like pull it apart by like
[5070.65s -> 5078.18s]  10 i feel like my whole problem would go away i've said that out loud before so it i don't know
[5078.18s -> 5085.08s]  maybe it's pressure and inflammation in the rib cage i don't know i'm not a doctor i have the key
[5085.08s -> 5094.49s]  now silver key was back here it was down or was it i remember seeing it i remember looking at it
[5095.21s -> 5102.73s]  and the doctor goes well no no jeremy that's not that's not a good idea
[5103.29s -> 5124.41s]  can you spawn in place i'd like to not use where are you who where the fuck are you
[5136.02s -> 5153.05s]  that's what i want to do that oh it's so precise but oh it's so got it i remember initially this
[5153.05s -> 5157.21s]  this is the okay a lot of you guys can probably relate to this i'm sure i'm sure most people can
[5157.21s -> 5167.29s]  relate to this but when this all started it's like you know when you're like certain of something
[5168.25s -> 5175.05s]  and you like this has to like i thought i thought i thought i had lime to be completely up front
[5176.25s -> 5180.97s]  which is like i read a you know test me for lime you don't have lime fuck well what is wrong with
[5180.97s -> 5189.53s]  me then i think i might have a bacterial infection check it nope you don't fuck what do you think i
[5189.53s -> 5194.73s]  have we can test for this too maybe you have uh this uh inflammatory arthritis disease all right
[5194.81s -> 5219.21s]  do it please is this it nope what the fuck is going on it turns out my stomach is pushing up
[5219.21s -> 5226.02s]  into my diaphragm in my uh hyoidal esophageal area that's problem number one unfortunately
[5226.02s -> 5230.50s]  this surgery is the only way to get rid of it and it's mine's apparently not bad enough to have
[5230.50s -> 5247.58s]  surgery on so fuck so now what now what do you do you just have to i don't know you just have to
[5247.58s -> 5250.78s]  keep doing whatever you're doing to try to figure out what the fuck is wrong with you
[5251.74s -> 5271.06s]  i need health that's most important the human body sucks yeah one of you is going to replace
[5271.06s -> 5279.77s]  all of my like our parts i want to go to a car mechanic for me to get like a new rib cage
[5280.73s -> 5286.54s]  just let me lie on my back put me on one of those things that lift you all the way up into the air
[5287.26s -> 5297.27s]  at the car mechanic and just look under there and open up my back because there'll be a panel back
[5297.27s -> 5314.87s]  there and power me down and then just start replacing stuff it's gonna open here that he's
[5314.87s -> 5332.79s]  a new engine imagine we ran imagine we ran on gasoline you just chug gasoline you went to the
[5332.79s -> 5345.53s]  tank instead of your car you just like put your mouth in the nozzle and just like we run on food
[5345.53s -> 5352.31s]  yeah but i mean if you had like an engine in your body you need to pull your cord like five times
[5352.31s -> 5366.58s]  to like start again how loud would the world be i'm talking like
[5372.20s -> 5379.80s]  it would be horrible that's all you'd be it would be like a swarm of bees everywhere in every single
[5379.80s -> 5392.73s]  neighborhood in every single spot gold key for this everything would stink yeah it would everything
[5392.73s -> 5400.46s]  would be it would smell like gasoline everywhere you'd have to yeah you mute on your ear yeah you
[5400.54s -> 5404.22s]  no not mute on your ears your ears are still your ears you're just running gas
[5415.82s -> 5421.14s]  you wouldn't be able to ever have a phone call but we wouldn't even need phone calls because
[5421.14s -> 5426.18s]  at that point you'd just be communicating through your brain i don't know like whatever facebook is

[6052.65s -> 6059.19s]  fucking just never stream again thank god you stopped playing the hand game that was a long
[6059.19s -> 6076.82s]  time ago that was at least like an hour and 40 minutes ago hand simulator but remember
[6076.82s -> 6083.99s]  this is an extra stream this week this doesn't count this is not an actual spring this is a
[6083.99s -> 6105.96s]  fake stream because tomorrow joel and i are gonna play halo reach and then after that
[6106.76s -> 6125.38s]  it's gonna be another co-op experience this is like the week of co-op and hand simulator i had to
[6125.38s -> 6133.53s]  look i know a lot of people are gonna say do what i said but i had to play that month i had to
[6134.41s -> 6141.54s]  i do you know how long i've had hand simulator for in my steam inventory since 2016
[6144.31s -> 6158.30s]  i had to play it and i'm not playing that by myself you didn't have to at all nobody forced
[6158.30s -> 6165.18s]  you to play it i did i forced myself to play it once because i needed to know there's so
[6165.18s -> 6171.02s]  many talks so much talk about how fucking fun it is and how funny and cool it is i had to try it
[6171.02s -> 6177.10s]  and there was my one opportunity the secret stream that's not a stream is the perfect opportunity
[6177.10s -> 6196.60s]  for that you think i'm gonna use a real stream for that game come on come on more more more more
[6196.60s -> 6211.19s]  more where are they there's another full one here what's the other co-op game uh we're gonna try
[6212.07s -> 6219.90s]  to play the game called tools up just came out today it's local only but we're gonna try to
[6219.90s -> 6232.92s]  use that steam remote play thing we're gonna test and see if that thing works it's the plan
[6245.93s -> 6261.83s]  i want to use let's try this okay that's pretty cool but i feel like i'm wasting it anybody have
[6261.83s -> 6268.36s]  any experience with the uh the steam remote play does it actually work it works but it could be a
[6268.36s -> 6280.98s]  little weird no okay how so it's all right won't you get horrendous ping um i don't think so because
[6280.98s -> 6291.94s]  it's gonna be me star and then probably talus and talus and i have the same so i don't think it'll
[6291.94s -> 6310.02s]  be an issue a game called tools up okay uh it's like star was telling me earlier and this is i
[6310.02s -> 6315.62s]  don't know he's a he's a salty bastard isn't he look at how salty this is he said it reminds

[6340.15s -> 6347.99s]  you know what i'm saying like he hated it he just didn't like it is that impossible is it possible
[6347.99s -> 6354.38s]  to not like this for cleanup detail i feel like that's saying super mario sucks
