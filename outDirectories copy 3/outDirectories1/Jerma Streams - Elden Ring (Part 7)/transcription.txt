[5.11s -> 13.94s]  Hello. Yes, I'm currently- I'm currently late, but it's okay. It's a very good reason to be late,
[13.94s -> 17.22s]  and I'll show you the reason. Well, he's running out. He ran out of the room. Never mind.
[18.10s -> 28.92s]  He ran out. He was- he was here. Arto. Hold on. Ready? Arto, look. Arto, come over here.
[29.96s -> 33.06s]  Go! Go over there. Quick, I need to show you on stream.
[33.78s -> 44.62s]  Arto, what's this? Arto, what's over there? Arto! Hey, Arto! Arto! Arto!
[44.62s -> 51.51s]  You saw his tail. I- all right, whatever. I was trying to get him to, like, be, like, on camera.
[51.51s -> 55.83s]  And just, like, bed. It don't matter. All right, go back to the intro. You saw his tail.
[55.83s -> 75.02s]  See? There he is. Maybe he'll show back up. Arto! What's that? A fishkin? A fishkin!
[75.02s -> 78.76s]  All right, I'll get out of the way. All right. All right, all right, all right.
[79.32s -> 91.78s]  Back to the intro. Is Arto a tortoise? Um, he's kind of as fat as a tortoise.
[92.42s -> 103.96s]  Best in time to see Arto. Yeah, he chased- he chased a little, uh, a little, like, milk boat in here.
[106.74s -> 116.25s]  Arto is a wise beast, yeah. All right, yeah. We're gonna play more Elden Ring. Hello? Let me just
[116.25s -> 122.92s]  tweet this. I just did want to show that because people were asking, where is Arto? There- there's
[122.92s -> 197.22s]  Arto. Now, let's let the intro play out for a minute. Hold on. Okay, I'm back. Okay, so you're
[197.22s -> 204.54s]  also probably noticing something very important. It's very, very important. Um, there's no drop
[204.54s -> 215.05s]  frames, and there shouldn't be. I have absolutely no idea why that's been happening, but I think
[215.05s -> 223.42s]  I've got- I've fixed it. I did, uh, a bunch of stream tests on a bunch of different servers,
[224.73s -> 229.93s]  and I found a server. I found one of the Twitch servers, a server that is working well.
[231.51s -> 238.44s]  I've streamed to the same server for, like, two years, and I can't stream to it anymore, I guess.
[238.44s -> 251.11s]  I don't know why. I have no idea. Nothing changed on my end. It's just, I don't know if the traffic
[251.11s -> 257.11s]  has started getting routed in a different way, but it gets across your fingers because I think
[257.11s -> 265.64s]  this is gonna be fine. Please stop playing Elden Ring. Is this your retirement special? What,
[265.64s -> 273.48s]  like, I'm just going hard and then never coming back? Okay, okay, listen. Games like these only
[273.48s -> 280.42s]  come around, like, once every half a decade. So, no, look, I'm not gonna go play, like,
[280.42s -> 286.42s]  fucking bathtub simulator right now. Elden Ring comes along once every fucking half decade,
[286.42s -> 293.34s]  right? Maybe once every decade. We'll, I promise, we'll go back to, like,
[294.06s -> 297.90s]  we'll go back to fucking screwdriver simulator in, like, a week, all right?
[303.24s -> 307.64s]  Well, you play as a screwdriver and you have to, like, roll around and get to checkpoints
[307.64s -> 311.96s]  only using your body to roll. Like, we'll go back to those. Just give me, just give me some time.
[312.52s -> 325.51s]  Heart simulator. I actually, it's funny because I, we actually might play Mario Golf,
[325.51s -> 330.52s]  like, in a couple days or something. That's a, that's a pretty good way to break up Elden Ring,
[330.52s -> 336.12s]  right? That one person that said you should play Mario Golf, and I was like, no, that sounds like
[336.12s -> 344.49s]  a dumb idea. Well, I'm just gonna play Mario Golf. So, maybe the next stream after this will
[344.49s -> 350.22s]  be Mario Golf, and then we'll go back to Elden Ring. But currently very into it, at least into
[350.22s -> 355.93s]  it enough to keep streaming it. We'll see. I don't, this game is massive, so I don't know
[355.93s -> 360.66s]  how far I'm gonna get. All I know is right now I'm super interested, so let's go. Guys, ready?
[361.38s -> 367.66s]  Etterby. Make sure I'm in a good spot. Make sure that the camera's in a good spot.
[370.33s -> 378.74s]  And, I mean, are we, are we good? We should be. He's still hanging out. He's still hanging out. I
[378.74s -> 383.70s]  can't promise he'll be here the whole time. He'll probably start running around. He like, he's an
[383.70s -> 393.74s]  explorer. He, Otto does not have one particular place that he likes. I've had to get like three
[393.74s -> 399.58s]  different little dog beds because he, I want to be in this room. No, no, no. I want to be in this
[399.58s -> 405.94s]  room. He'll go down into, he'll go into another room and lie on a pile of clothes. And it's like,
[405.94s -> 413.06s]  what are you doing in here? I, I could get you a bed. And then a bed, I'll get a little bed in
[413.06s -> 417.66s]  that same spot where the clothes were. And he sits in that bed all the time. It's like, it's one of
[417.66s -> 428.02s]  his like bonfires. Otto has literally bonfires all around every place they've ever been in.
[428.02s -> 438.38s]  And some of them, I got him a really expensive bed and he doesn't like it. I wasn't calling Otto
[438.38s -> 445.56s]  fat. Is it, no, well you can call Otto fat because he is a little fat. All right. You guys ready?
[447.58s -> 452.39s]  I'm very happy that the internet seems to be good. I seem to have found the server that works.
[452.39s -> 459.29s]  So let's hope that continues. You're probably wondering why I have 20,000 souls when I'd had
[459.29s -> 466.06s]  like two last stream. That's very important. It's because I was testing the internet. So I was just
[466.06s -> 472.57s]  running around doing like a stream test and just trying to replicate the problem. And the problem
[472.57s -> 480.50s]  has not been replicated. So yeah, whatever. And I may, I may have like, I may have like fucking,
[482.33s -> 490.55s]  I may have read a few things. I may have like read a lot. What level am I right now? I am level 73.
[490.55s -> 504.76s]  Let's take a look. Let's do, let's, you know, let's do this first because we do this every stream.
[504.76s -> 509.98s]  Let's take a look at what we can, what we can do here. Some of the stuff needs to be updated.
[509.98s -> 515.78s]  For instance, light fires and knock around that we already did that.
[515.78s -> 522.98s]  Renes is closed for now. It is no longer closed. We've, we got to it. This is still accurate. This
[522.98s -> 532.55s]  is still accurate. This is still accurate. And can I, can I get rid of this? Door next to spawn
[532.55s -> 542.62s]  is blocked shut. Should I just remove that? I feel like that's completely irrelevant. All right,
[542.62s -> 548.94s]  whatever. So the last thing that I did, I was about to go down here. We're currently doing
[548.94s -> 557.72s]  Renes quest, which is going to lead us apparently down here. No audio. Let me fix that immediately.
[558.20s -> 568.95s]  Let's go. Oh, well I already see a huge problem. Face cam is not even in the right spot. It's
[568.95s -> 585.21s]  already a big problem. That's better. Is it better? It is. Kind of. All right, let's go.
[588.65s -> 590.89s]  You're wondering the kind of character I'm playing. I'm playing a little bit of intelligence,
[590.89s -> 596.63s]  a little bit of dexterity, a little bit of int. I think I'm probably about to run into something
[596.63s -> 601.83s]  that I'm not prepared for right now, but whatever. It's elven ring, baby. You just fucking got to go.
[602.47s -> 617.03s]  Are you doing a bimbo build? Um, I don't, I don't know. I actually was laughing my ass off.
[617.59s -> 624.25s]  I was, I was, okay. So before I fell asleep last night, I was laughing. I couldn't stop laughing
[624.25s -> 632.54s]  because I was thinking about the me strong. Like, no, you have to do one stream as me strong,
[632.54s -> 638.79s]  but you have to be high on THC. And I just, I don't know. I started laughing so hard about it
[638.79s -> 645.91s]  because like, imagine this, this fucking, this guy, this caveman, like a loincloth and a big
[645.91s -> 651.96s]  turkey leg club, just like ate a bunch of berries he found and he's just like fucking fucked up and
[651.96s -> 658.46s]  high. And he's the guy that can like, he can like kill Margaret. No, they would, that guy would die
[658.46s -> 664.17s]  instantly. That guy would die without even anyone attacking him. I'm just imagining this like, just
[664.17s -> 669.85s]  completely hallucinogenic high caveman, just walking around and killing stuff. And it's just
[669.85s -> 677.22s]  like, why are you in this universe? You should not be in this universe. And like, that's what
[677.22s -> 684.34s]  would be happening. It would just be, I would be inebriated, I guess in quotes, and I would be
[684.34s -> 690.06s]  just role playing as this weird caveman. That's how the ancestors did it. Yeah. That's like kind
[690.06s -> 696.38s]  of fucking weird that that's exactly what happened. If you're this Bush, colorful Bush,
[700.02s -> 707.08s]  oh, you, I kill you. Like, no, no, no, don't kill me. What are you talking about? Don't hurt me.
[707.72s -> 719.86s]  I, it was fucking nonsense back then. That's what got me on that is you want to talk about
[719.86s -> 726.30s]  bimbo gameplay? That's not how weed works. I'm not saying weed, I'm saying like back in like the
[726.30s -> 731.66s]  fucking, before the prehistoric medieval times, where like cavemen were eating like random
[731.66s -> 735.58s]  hallucinogenic berries and fucking killing each other. What, of course, that's not what happens
[735.58s -> 743.86s]  when you, if you have like, what are you talking about? All right, I actually think I can level up.
[744.34s -> 765.32s]  Let's go. Ooh, that's, that's a clean 10k. That's a clean 10k. 31. Okay. Why is that a clip on
[765.32s -> 780.92s]  command? I didn't see it. What was it? All right. I, I, I, I think I, I, I, I can't see. I can't see.
[780.92s -> 785.00s]  He can't see. I can't see. Why am I doing so many mad, mad, mad, mad world references? Maybe it's
[785.00s -> 791.91s]  because I like watched it recently. All right. I'm going to say, do we just dump intelligence and
[791.91s -> 799.27s]  try to get it to 50 or do I need to seriously put more points in endurance? I don't, endurance is
[799.27s -> 806.78s]  not an issue in this game. It really isn't something that's changed in this game. I don't
[806.78s -> 810.54s]  know what they did or what kind of math or calculations they've been making and Elden ring.
[811.26s -> 816.82s]  I don't even feel like endurance is the bar. It feels like it's very, very forgiving to a
[816.82s -> 824.12s]  point where like, you don't even need to put points into it unless you're doing like a heavy
[824.12s -> 829.40s]  character. Yeah. But it used to be, you would need to put endurance points in because the stamina
[829.40s -> 838.89s]  bar was hard to manage. All right. How do I get down here? Is it, can I jump from here?
[839.61s -> 855.88s]  I have to jump. Are you kidding me? I'm going to die if I fall down here. No, I can't do that.
[855.88s -> 874.26s]  So where do I go? There's a, there's a lip right here. Oh shit. Okay. Old and centipede sick. How
[874.26s -> 881.93s]  do you like your eggs? I want to know. Uh, over medium. I don't think eggs should be eaten over
[881.93s -> 887.69s]  easy or sunny side up unless the yolk is, uh, is not, I like a jammy yolk. I do not like a runny
[887.69s -> 894.94s]  yolk. I find that to be, it gets everywhere. It gets all over everything. A jammy yolk is able,
[894.94s -> 898.70s]  you get the benefits of having it be a little bit runny, but it doesn't get all over your whole
[898.70s -> 904.70s]  plate. And you don't need like five napkins to go like this and shit. And I sometimes, I don't know
[904.70s -> 914.36s]  where, whenever I have a runny egg, it gets all over me. I don't know why I don't, I, I, I don't,
[914.36s -> 919.26s]  I don't understand how, but it just does like, it'll get like here or something. And then it's
[919.26s -> 923.42s]  like here and then it's like on a napkin and then it like starts solidifying. No, no running,
[923.42s -> 931.24s]  no runny yolk. It gets all over everything. Hey, do you want eggs, this, this, and this?
[932.12s -> 936.76s]  Oh, sorry. What you meant to say was put egg all over all the stuff that I have. I want,
[936.76s -> 941.80s]  I want egg yolk all over everything that I have on my plate. Now separate it. I like having it with,
[941.80s -> 945.98s]  I like a jammy yolk because it's still a little runny, but it doesn't get everywhere.
[950.49s -> 953.45s]  I don't, I don't think that's such a weird take. You eat like a two-year-old.
[954.17s -> 959.05s]  Enjoying jammy yolks is not a two-year-old thing. A two-year-old would be mommy, I want them
[959.05s -> 968.63s]  scrambled. So no, I don't think that, I don't think your take is accurate. Oh, I hate these
[968.63s -> 984.49s]  guys. Geez, your attack patterns are fucking weird. 718 damage. Why would I even normally swing?
[988.20s -> 991.24s]  Why would I, why would I even swing the Katana if I'm doing that much damage?
[994.12s -> 1000.92s]  Pests. All right, hold on. I can't look at that yet. You're making a mess when you shouldn't.
[1000.92s -> 1008.01s]  I mean, honest to God, this is the best. Is this, I don't know how this is scaling with my
[1008.01s -> 1013.77s]  intelligence. That magic ability is unbelievably good. It's like, I'm like, I'm actually concerned
[1013.77s -> 1028.18s]  they're going to nerf it. It's that good. 700 fucking damage versus like two or three hundred
[1028.18s -> 1033.21s]  damage a swing, 300 damage a swing. And then the range is unbelievable. That's getting nerfed.
[1041.91s -> 1055.06s]  Sword of the night and fire is better. It's 2000 damage. Really? Holy shit. Well, let's go.
[1061.21s -> 1064.41s]  He's, he's such a weirdo. I don't like this guy because he's, you know what I mean?
[1065.77s -> 1072.46s]  Sometimes he'll go down, but he doesn't swing. Late game is stupid. So it makes sense.
[1073.56s -> 1078.76s]  Uh, okay. That's a good to know. So wait, that's like not crazy. I feel like it is though.
[1084.55s -> 1090.90s]  Late game is nutty. Oh, all right. Well, I want these items and I don't care if I die because I,
[1090.90s -> 1095.30s]  I'm item run Andy. So I, I don't, I know like some people you've probably seen play this game. Just
[1095.30s -> 1115.10s]  look over here and go, I don't give a fuck. Hello. What is this thing? What? Oh my God,
[1115.10s -> 1132.25s]  get out of here. Okay. Well, this is like a rot dragon. It really is just that guy that I,
[1132.25s -> 1137.29s]  how much health does he have? All right. Well, I can't literally going to die from the rot.
[1141.48s -> 1144.68s]  Damn. All right. Well, that's a kind of weird mini boss over there.
[1149.91s -> 1158.98s]  Uh, but look at how wise this guy is. He's got a white beard speckles. They just,
[1158.98s -> 1165.98s]  there aren't many bosses now. They're just normal mobs. Well, that's kind of nuts.
[1170.57s -> 1191.29s]  I got the items. So I'm wrong. What's going on? What's going on here? Come on. Fucking game
[1191.29s -> 1205.59s]  crashed. The game just literally crashed. I hope that's not. No, my, it should be fine.
[1205.59s -> 1221.46s]  Are we getting Fs? Well, we're getting, that was a hardware F because that almost just
[1221.46s -> 1234.09s]  crashed my whole computer. That was not an internet F. Yeah. That was a, that was a hardware F.
[1234.81s -> 1254.79s]  And this is like not running well either. This is like bad. All right. Well, whatever. Yeah,
[1254.79s -> 1272.47s]  I know, I know, I know. Whatever. Laugh my ass off. Elden Ring sucks. I think so. I just,
[1276.17s -> 1291.61s]  where the hell, where am I? Why am I over here? Why did he put me over here? What? My souls are
[1291.61s -> 1304.42s]  over there. Yeah. My souls are down here. What level am I? 74. Yeah. I think the game like put
[1304.42s -> 1311.21s]  me in a different place because I died. I, I, this is exactly where I died. The game like
[1311.21s -> 1326.17s]  crashed and like dumped me in another location. Oh well. All right. Let's go. Yeah. I mean, there
[1326.17s -> 1331.86s]  are, there are some technical issues sometimes with the game, but whatever. Not going to stop
[1331.86s -> 1338.17s]  me from fucking playing. I don't even care about these souls really either. Was it like 5,000,
[1338.81s -> 1346.30s]  2,000? Would you say that you loved it? Oh, it's actually 10,000. Nevermind.
[1346.94s -> 1351.85s]  Uh, would you say that you love this game? Um, I don't think I'd be playing it as much as I am
[1351.85s -> 1369.10s]  if I didn't really, really easy for you guys to know that considering, uh, considering, um,
[1369.10s -> 1378.95s]  how much I play games on this screen, me playing a video game for more than four hours and going,
[1379.59s -> 1386.63s]  yeah, I'll play that tomorrow. Oh my God. Not paying attention. I played this game for more
[1386.63s -> 1389.43s]  than two screens in a row, which means it's like the best game that's ever been made.
[1389.99s -> 1399.80s]  There you go. Don't fucking crash again. Yeah. No, we're good. All right. No, okay. Come on.
[1399.80s -> 1409.45s]  These guys hurt a lot. What does it, what's the damage they're doing? They thrust. If German
[1409.45s -> 1415.29s]  nine eight five, that's me, is going to play your game for more than 10 hours on stream,
[1416.44s -> 1424.15s]  you've got something really special, real special. And that does not hold on. Let me make,
[1424.15s -> 1428.79s]  I got to be clear to you guys. That does not mean that I have some incredibly high standard
[1429.35s -> 1436.31s]  like, wow, you impressing me. Wow. What a feat that is. No, I'm saying that it's so difficult
[1436.31s -> 1443.83s]  to hold my attention on anything that you holding my attention is ridiculous. Like is
[1443.83s -> 1449.45s]  really actually impressive because I stuff does not hold my attention that well. And it's not
[1449.45s -> 1453.13s]  because it doesn't matter how good or bad something is. I usually move on very quickly
[1453.13s -> 1468.14s]  to the next thing. These guys, I don't like these fucking things. What are the ego? No,
[1468.14s -> 1488.66s]  I'm saying, I'm telling you, it's not an ego thing. Okay. These guys do this. How many souls
[1488.66s -> 1504.26s]  each? Jesus. That's a lot. You assert you refer to yourself in the third person. Yeah. I'm not,
[1504.26s -> 1515.24s]  as a joke, I don't actually do that. That's, that was a huge burp. And if I opened my mouth,
[1515.24s -> 1529.88s]  I would have threw up. What a bad attention span. I do have had. I've had attention issues
[1529.88s -> 1536.70s]  my whole life, man. Even going into my forties, it's going to be, I'm not, I'm not 40 yet,
[1536.70s -> 1540.86s]  but you know what I mean? It's going to get even. I don't know. You know, I'm really concerned.
[1541.50s -> 1545.34s]  You wonder what my major concerns are kind of growing up and getting a lot older, older.
[1546.22s -> 1551.58s]  So I have really bad attention problems. I had my whole life. I've taken medication for it
[1551.58s -> 1558.73s]  decades ago, right? I've always had, I had issues that way. When you get older, you slow down. So
[1558.73s -> 1565.21s]  when I'm into my like mid forties into my like mid fifties, as my brain starts to slow down,
[1567.19s -> 1570.63s]  am I going to be able to like to do it? Am I, am I going to be able to think about anything?
[1572.06s -> 1575.82s]  Like I'm going to have like bad ADHD and like dementia at the same time.
[1577.14s -> 1582.10s]  Like as everybody kind of slowly goes to that, like kind of like degrading brain into the like
[1582.10s -> 1587.08s]  your fifties and sixties, that's going to be really strange. I'm going to, I'm going to make
[1587.08s -> 1589.96s]  sure I drink. I'm going to take a ton of vitamin E. Like I'm going to make sure I'm going to eat
[1589.96s -> 1605.00s]  fish like every day. Like seriously, take care of yourselves. What am I doing? I just aggroed the
[1605.00s -> 1624.95s]  whole camp. What am I thinking? I'm good. Attention deficit, hyperactivity, dementia.
[1626.31s -> 1638.30s]  I mean, I'll be honest. That seems like fuck. Like I don't know. I'm going to make sure I'm
[1638.30s -> 1673.02s]  going to take, like, I'm going to make sure I'm like eating right. Jesus. What the fuck? I thought
[1673.02s -> 1675.50s]  he was behind the, I thought he was behind the pillar. I actually thought he was behind the
[1675.50s -> 1683.29s]  pillar. I changed that by the way. Made that to heal over time instead of the stamina because
[1683.29s -> 1707.53s]  stamina is not a problem. You shouldn't be eating four McChickens. Guys. Okay. It's time for defense
[1707.53s -> 1714.57s]  mode Andy. Just because my McDonald's order is a little elaborate is a little excessive.
[1716.18s -> 1728.02s]  That's what's going on. I thought that was an item. What's this? I don't order it every day.
[1728.82s -> 1750.76s]  No, I'm not. I don't want to go down the fucking river. That'd be so. Okay. Huge missed opportunity
[1750.76s -> 1760.36s]  from FromSoftware. If you died, just showed up on screen right now. Just. Oh, that would be so funny.
[1760.36s -> 1773.22s]  What a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, I actually didn't want to go in there.
[1773.78s -> 1792.63s]  You eat McDonald's every day. Now what? He eats more than my whole family of five.
[1794.18s -> 1801.80s]  I am not eating that much McDonald's. Where the fuck am I? This is going to be like a boss.
[1802.68s -> 1811.80s]  Please give me a bonfire so I can at least level up before I lose all these souls.
[1823.98s -> 1827.82s]  Look, I love McDonald's. It's McDonald's is the absolute best.
[1829.13s -> 1837.16s]  Nothing will ever compare. You know, it's kind of weird. I've been, I've been to five-star restaurants.
[1837.80s -> 1845.43s]  I've eaten five-star meals, but the way that my brain reacts to eating, like if I'm hungry,
[1845.43s -> 1853.67s]  a double cheeseburger from McDonald's, nothing compares. Like that, if I'm really hungry,
[1853.67s -> 1860.71s]  double cheeseburger from McDonald's. Bam. That four seconds. One, two, three, four. Nothing
[1860.71s -> 1866.39s]  compares to that. And like, Oh, what's this? What's this? Oh, parsley dusted, um, chicken thigh,
[1866.87s -> 1876.01s]  uh, I don't know. Whatever it is. And like, Oh, interesting. Interesting flavors.
[1877.29s -> 1894.10s]  Into the napkin. What do you have? Fuck. I don't, there's no bonfire.
[1894.82s -> 1903.50s]  There's a statue, but I'm going to lose 35,000 souls. No, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.
[1904.06s -> 1916.33s]  I'm not doing it. I have a, I have a level. What would I throw a level away?
[1916.97s -> 1928.60s]  That's an extra point in intelligence. Now I'm just going to run past everybody.
[1929.16s -> 1945.40s]  Do you have matcha today? Of course I do. Like there's, I would assume at this point,
[1945.40s -> 1951.10s]  there's more matcha powder fragments than red blood cells in my body. The last like two weeks.
[1951.90s -> 1965.08s]  Look, I'm in a public school bathroom. What are you talking about? Like right now? I don't know
[1965.16s -> 1975.75s]  many public school bathrooms that have like shelves with like video games on them, dude.
[1975.75s -> 1994.33s]  Okay. Does this actually kill you? I need to see because if it doesn't, then I'm just going to do
[1994.33s -> 1999.58s]  it. I'm just, no, it's going to kill me. Heat seeking missiles. Yeah. Then they shoot a thousand
[1999.58s -> 2018.62s]  of them. They're talking about where the game is right now. Oh, that seems what public school
[2018.62s -> 2053.51s]  bathroom. I swear to God, if that kills me again, crap, it was a chest here.
[2053.51s -> 2064.86s]  Scorpion stinger. Oh, that looks cool. Whatever that is. It's definitely not intelligence,
[2064.86s -> 2068.06s]  but it's probably so cool. I got to remember this for a future playthrough because that probably
[2068.06s -> 2080.31s]  would really like this. It's a, it's a dagger. Also Scarlet rot buildup. Oh, and it's got,
[2080.31s -> 2099.42s]  and it's got fuzz. This thing's hairy. This is awesome. And it does like, it's like stinger
[2099.42s -> 2117.93s]  flash. Oh, I like, want to use this. That's so cool. Scorpion. Very cool. Unfortunately,
[2118.97s -> 2124.55s]  that's the kind of character I'm playing. That's where it is. If you're wondering
[2125.19s -> 2134.57s]  the grand cloister, it's the weapon info. Weapon info is fashion from a great scorpions tail
[2134.57s -> 2139.85s]  glistening with Scarlet rot, a ceremonial tool used by heretics crafted from the
[2139.85s -> 2151.74s]  relic of a sealed outer God. Okay. So that's all I need to do there. Now I hope the flask
[2151.74s -> 2157.90s]  allocation is good because this looks like a boss. So we're just going to go, I don't care about
[2157.90s -> 2171.77s]  those souls. Who cares? Go get in the coffin. It's literally like a thousand shares. It's
[2171.77s -> 2176.89s]  literally just a thousand shares. It doesn't matter. How many shares of that do I own of this?
[2176.89s -> 2191.08s]  What do I mean shares? Stock Stanley. Okay. Here we go. Double headphones going in. Time for me
[2191.08s -> 2195.24s]  to pay attention. I appreciate everybody's help. I appreciate everybody's, you know,
[2195.24s -> 2199.16s]  Hey dude, you're doing pretty good. Hey dude, you're doing awful, but I'm going to have them
[2199.16s -> 2207.59s]  tuning you out for the next two or three straight minutes. There's a statue here so I can come back.
[2207.59s -> 2211.91s]  I have two, eight and two. I want, hopefully it's enough. I don't know.
[2213.30s -> 2224.74s]  Uh, in the astell natural born of the void. Why does everybody have one of those?
[2225.38s -> 2232.50s]  Can I, can I complain? Why does every boss have that move? Have they all have it?
[2233.14s -> 2247.10s]  They're like, welcome to the arena. Boom. This thing is great. It's like a whole solar system.
[2257.45s -> 2265.02s]  A lot of big explosive AOE. You have to jump and hit. Yeah. You're going to jump.
[2265.74s -> 2287.40s]  You're so big. I can't even. Oh my God. Okay. So that does one, two, three. Jesus. Okay.
[2289.06s -> 2296.47s]  You have so many moves. Do you have that too? Okay. That's not magic. That's not magical at all.
[2297.43s -> 2312.01s]  That's not magical at all. That was not magical at all. This is crazy looking boss though. Okay.
[2312.73s -> 2321.58s]  Well, very interesting. This is probably one of the cooler looking bosses. I think that they've
[2321.58s -> 2330.62s]  made, there was a tier list for interesting boss look like design a lot longer than that.
[2330.62s -> 2340.33s]  I think this guy would be up pretty high. That's oh man. That's hard. It does like it comes down,
[2340.33s -> 2369.70s]  but it doesn't hit Jesus. Okay. He goes like before he does it. Fuck. I was at a stamina.
[2370.42s -> 2388.97s]  Oh, maybe, maybe I shouldn't hit him in the face. Maybe I should hit him like inside. Oh my God. He
[2388.97s -> 2409.46s]  doesn't like that. Oh, okay. He's got like, like 15 move, 20 plus moves and counting.
[2410.10s -> 2423.90s]  This is going to be fun. He's just a nerd's rope. Oh yeah. Wicked coal dude. He's a nerd's rope with
[2423.90s -> 2443.08s]  like fangs. I think you can outrun it. Let me see if you can outrun it. Nerd's rope. Maybe like in
[2443.08s -> 2450.28s]  his back legs. I think, I think facing him head on is way too dangerous. Maybe I can like break one
[2450.28s -> 2455.64s]  of his little, he's got these like little crab legs. I should be able to break them. Maybe I can
[2455.64s -> 2465.16s]  stun him. How are you supposed to get the fuck away from that? That's an instant kill. Of course,
[2465.72s -> 2470.68s]  of course this is Elden Ring. Every major boss has an instant kill move. Forgot. I forgot what
[2470.68s -> 2483.80s]  video game I was playing. Okay. I wonder, can I dodge that when he does it? Like right before
[2483.80s -> 2496.39s]  he does it. Maybe. I cannot use the horse here. Unfortunately, I'm still going to go for the legs.
[2496.39s -> 2500.41s]  I think the back legs, he's got these little tiny little like lobster legs. I think I can probably
[2500.41s -> 2523.50s]  like hurt them or break them. I don't think so. Maybe not. It's definitely his head. It's absolutely
[2523.50s -> 2561.62s]  his head that hurts the most. That little right in his cracked skull. Jesus. Fuck. Couldn't see
[2561.62s -> 2573.03s]  where his arm was. I wonder how much, how much magic damage I'll do. Let's try it. Oh baby.
[2574.20s -> 2676.09s]  That's a lot. Shit. Fuck. We're going now? Hey. All right. All right. All right. Where?
[2683.62s -> 2702.14s]  What the fuck? Hey, yeah. That move sucks. I have that too. It's terrible. Shit. What the fuck is
[2702.14s -> 2758.81s]  that thing? Oh, fuck you. Oh shit. In my pants. Oh my God. It did it fucking three times. Oh my God.
[2758.81s -> 2765.77s]  It does it three times again. Get out. Get out. Don't, don't be over here. Get away from him.
[2765.77s -> 2797.10s]  There's no reason to be there. Okay. That's what I was talking about. We're fine. Holy shit. What?
[2798.06s -> 2801.18s]  Don't die from that. Don't die from that. I got enough. I got, I don't have enough.
[2803.26s -> 2812.25s]  He appeared fucking behind. I didn't know where he was going. All right. Well, I, here's the thing.
[2813.21s -> 2830.50s]  Here's the thing. I can get him. I should have brought an extra. I'll get him. I thought I,
[2830.50s -> 2836.92s]  I thought I had him. All right. I'm getting it, but that sucks. It's too fast. All right. Let's go.
[2842.33s -> 2851.37s]  I might, if I don't beat him in the next couple of tries, may. Dude, what the fuck are you doing,
[2851.37s -> 2954.04s]  man? Oh, fuck. Oh, those explode. Breathe. That shit took up the whole script.
[3032.60s -> 3039.16s]  Oh, fuck you, dude. It's so hard to know. I don't think I'm dead. I'm alive. Oh my God. Fuck that
[3039.16s -> 3046.20s]  move, dude. Like he just, he appears fucking somewhere behind you and it's like you lose
[3046.20s -> 3058.01s]  lock on and he's just right in your fucking face. That move is so stupid. Like, come on.
[3061.32s -> 3069.53s]  That's fucking dumb. That's stupid. Cause like where the fuck even is he going to be? He's
[3069.53s -> 3074.81s]  behind you. You lose lock on and then he's just right on your ass. Like, dude, I just,
[3074.81s -> 3080.73s]  did I just spam dodge? He'll, he'll, he'll catch me. It's such fucking horse shit.
[3080.73s -> 3128.44s]  I don't care. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. It's just going to come down to like,
[3128.44s -> 3134.01s]  when he does that shit, I guess just no matter where he is, just like instantly dodge.
[3134.81s -> 3160.62s]  I don't, I, I don't, I have no idea. Oh fuck. I did that twice in a row. Oh, I'm just tilting.
[3160.62s -> 3169.62s]  It's over. Yeah, I'm just tilting. I'm just full tilt because that fucking dumb grab move.
[3170.42s -> 3201.72s]  The gravity. No, the gravity move is not instant kill. It's just like an 80%.
[3202.36s -> 3210.22s]  The grab move might actually be instant kill or at least like 95% or something. I don't want to have
[3210.22s -> 3317.13s]  30 vitality. That was the one too. It's just so fucking frustrating. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[3319.64s -> 3324.28s]  Oh, I didn't even look and I fucking got there. Where are they?
[3324.28s -> 3476.09s]  Hey, where'd he go? What the fuck is that thing? Trying to bait out the face.
[3496.47s -> 3570.89s]  Fuck. Where the fuck am I? Oh, bro. I'm alive. I'm going to be alive. I'm going to be alive.
[3570.89s -> 3595.35s]  I'm going to be alive. What's happening? I'm against the fucking goddamn skybox wall.
[3595.35s -> 3648.98s]  I'm against this. I'm against the wall. This is wall. Oh, fuck you game. No.
[3737.38s -> 3760.58s]  Oh, the game's fucking easy. It's not even a hard game. Instant kill moves are stupid. Delete them.
[3760.58s -> 3763.30s]  Patch them out of the game. Instant kill moves are fucking deleted from the game. Instant kill
[3763.30s -> 3766.18s]  moves. You should never have put those in the game. They're fucking stupid. Nobody likes them.
[3766.18s -> 3777.42s]  Nobody, not one person likes them. You remember when Jay Leno used to walk around on the street
[3777.42s -> 3781.42s]  and be like, oh, hey, so what do you think about like this? Hey, what do you think about like Chevy?
[3781.42s -> 3784.62s]  Right? No, no, no. If it was like, oh, hey, I got a question for you. What do you,
[3785.34s -> 3788.22s]  in a video game, if something could kill you in one hit instantly,
[3789.18s -> 3794.38s]  do you like it? No, no, and I don't know. No, Jay, Jay Leno, I don't like it. Oh, well,
[3794.38s -> 3797.66s]  we got another person here. What do you think about instant kill moves in games?
[3797.66s -> 3801.42s]  I fucking hate them. They should never be in a video game. Oh, yeah, we're getting
[3803.26s -> 3819.42s]  interesting responses. I hate them. It's like one little move and it's like dad, dad, dad, dad,
[3819.42s -> 3827.91s]  dad. Even if it's not, I know that it is though. It is. Your health is just too low. He doesn't
[3827.91s -> 3835.29s]  have any instant kill moves. Okay, if I chop you up in a meat grinder and the only thing that
[3835.29s -> 3843.03s]  comes out and that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead. You're probably going to,
[3843.59s -> 3848.63s]  not you, I'm just saying, like if somebody were to like push you into a meat grinder
[3849.59s -> 3853.59s]  and like one of your finger bones is still intact, they're not going to pick it up and go,
[3853.59s -> 3858.71s]  well, see, yeah, it wasn't an instant kill move. You still got like this part of your
[3858.71s -> 3868.07s]  finger left. No, I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder. I'm not going to put you into a
[3868.07s -> 3877.38s]  meat grinder. No, I'm making a reference to the fact that like if I, like if I were to get like
[3877.38s -> 3889.78s]  fucking killed, I don't know. You know what I'm saying? If, okay, if you were to, okay,
[3889.78s -> 3898.92s]  we're going to take humans out of this. If alien glob glob glob go one fucking shoots a disintegrating
[3898.92s -> 3907.38s]  ray at alien glob glow two, if there's only fucking teeth left, it's, it's fucking, you're dead.
[3907.38s -> 3922.28s]  You're dead. If I were to put you in a meat grinder. God damn it. That's so fucked up.
[3930.52s -> 3933.96s]  You understand what I'm saying though. I'm not actually saying I'm going to put somebody in a
[3933.96s -> 3958.71s]  meat grinder. God damn it. Let's go. What's the context? The context is if he does 95% of your
[3958.71s -> 3965.59s]  health in one move, it's, it's still the same because who I want you to find, you all do me a
[3965.59s -> 3972.25s]  favor. Find somebody that plays this game that has a hundred percent HP. No one's at 100% HP,
[3972.25s -> 3978.81s]  100% HP. Usually people are at like 80 or like 90 or like 85 or nobody. You can never get it right.
[3980.95s -> 3985.35s]  A 90 plus percent damage move is, is effectively killing you. It's you're dead.
[3986.15s -> 3996.38s]  MonkaS, I agree. I fucking, I had to use the meat grinder analogy, but it works.
[4001.94s -> 4018.54s]  Still not an instant kill. All right. Well, that was fun. I wonder if I should start doing this.
[4020.28s -> 4032.55s]  40. Let's play. Don't grind me up. No, whenever, okay. Whenever I say you, I mean like
[4033.43s -> 4037.27s]  collectively, like a thing, right? Like you don't like, let me tell you something. You know,
[4037.27s -> 4041.83s]  like I say, you know, like, you know, I don't actually, I don't actually know if you know,
[4041.83s -> 4047.67s]  I'm just saying you like, yeah, like, you know, you collectively, you know, you like if you,
[4047.67s -> 4052.15s]  you know, if you did, you know, if you trust me, no one's going to be cracked. I promise.
[4053.03s -> 4091.70s]  Now what do I do? He means you specifically. I can go, I can go back. So what did I get? This
[4091.70s -> 4101.40s]  is part of the quest or, oh, there's a place I can go. You're going to play the new destiny too.
[4102.04s -> 4106.28s]  That joke was like three months in the making and it already happened. So I'm sorry. You're
[4106.28s -> 4135.37s]  never going to see that ever again. Hey dude, like, um, it's actually not an instant kill move.
[4136.01s -> 4138.01s]  If I want to put you in a meat grinder.
[4146.82s -> 4151.70s]  Sorry. I didn't, I was just talking. I was like, I was speaking collectively, like just
[4151.70s -> 4167.98s]  like a thing that happens. Oh man. God damn it. I, I'm going to take this to the grave though.
[4167.98s -> 4176.82s]  Like 95, sorry, like 95 plus percent damage moves. I gotta move on. I gotta, I gotta,
[4176.82s -> 4180.18s]  I'm sorry. I gotta move on right now. I have to, I'm going to move on right now.
[4180.74s -> 4184.50s]  So we're going to continue to play. We're going to just keep playing. Elden ring,
[4184.50s -> 4189.54s]  Elden ring, no meat grinders. Nobody's going into meat grinder. Like I beat the boss. It was hard.
[4189.54s -> 4194.26s]  He was crazy. I got a little tilted in the middle there, but no, there's no meat grinders anymore.
[4194.26s -> 4208.57s]  Look at all these pigs. They're actually interesting. Stop it. Stop it. Okay. This is,
[4208.57s -> 4212.17s]  I actually wanted to explore this area. Why don't we explore? Let's take a quick look around.
[4212.90s -> 4216.82s]  Oh, look at this thing over here. We're going to mark some stuff on the map because that's what
[4216.82s -> 4223.02s]  we do in Elden ring. Let's check out some stuff. A new zone. There's a few places I think look kind
[4223.02s -> 4228.44s]  of interesting here. Uh, there's a farm over there too, but guys, I think we're going to check this
[4228.44s -> 4236.62s]  out first. I'm going to check that out first just to see what's over here. We'll start with, uh,
[4236.62s -> 4251.02s]  this one. I think this is a church. Potentially get a sacred flask. What the fuck? I'm not,
[4251.02s -> 4256.38s]  I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight a glint stone dragon right now.
[4258.94s -> 4275.80s]  I just had a boss fight. Who did you just kill? Was that an NPC? I hope that wasn't an NPC. Oh my
[4275.80s -> 4288.68s]  God. Oh my God. That's a glint stone dragon. Of course, magic's not going to do well against a
[4288.68s -> 4305.53s]  glint stone dragon. What was I thinking? This is a really bad place to fight a dragon.
[4306.81s -> 4336.36s]  Actually, I don't know what's going to happen here, but okay. That hurt. Am I fighting this
[4336.36s -> 4342.36s]  thing? I'm still shook up from the last one. I do need my souls though. I want to see what's in
[4342.36s -> 4355.94s]  there. Put them in the meek rider. It's going to take a while for, uh, I think this community
[4355.94s -> 4374.68s]  to get over that one. Oh, it is a cathedral. Starlight shards. Starlight shards. Starlight
[4374.68s -> 4388.09s]  shards. Starlight shards. These are everywhere. These, these are rare. They're purple lights.
[4388.73s -> 4417.80s]  That means it's rare. Meat grinder apology. Okay, so let's get all these. Why not?
[4424.98s -> 4429.54s]  These are a pretty rare resource. Starlight shards. I'm going to look it up in a minute,
[4429.54s -> 4435.46s]  but let's get this. I already, dude, I wouldn't mean to apologize. I spent the last like 20
[4435.46s -> 4441.70s]  straight minutes apologizing. We're talking about me grinding people, but my point still stood
[4441.70s -> 4467.26s]  very solid, I think. Very cool. That was what was here. Ooh, wait a minute.
[4468.79s -> 4481.27s]  There are ruins under here? There is. What? Am I dead? Am I going here?
[4484.66s -> 4489.78s]  There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge. There's a ledge.
[4490.74s -> 4522.79s]  And I have Starlight. I'm going to put that on. Okay, let's do it. What just keeps dying here?
[4523.35s -> 4554.14s]  Oh, thank God for Starlight. What is this thing? It's a hand. It's one of those fingers.
[4555.50s -> 4576.38s]  Clear ring. This guy, all that's left of this guy is his fucking hand.
[4577.02s -> 4582.38s]  All that a kill move? Is that an instant kill move? Or does his hand still exist?
[4582.38s -> 4588.42s]  All right, I'm moving on. No more talking about this. I'm kind of afraid of this. Should I put
[4588.42s -> 4595.51s]  the ring on? I don't want to put the ring on. All the ring rates will come get me. I feel like this
[4595.51s -> 4625.98s]  is bad. Wait, that's Rena. Oh, I thought I was going to take that ring that she had on and take
[4625.98s -> 4641.56s]  it off and put it on me. And look, this is so out of place. I look like I belong in like a fucking
[4641.56s -> 4661.59s]  Saturday morning funnies page in the paper. I don't belong in this scene. Oh, so Rena's back.
[4675.75s -> 4680.57s]  To the night sky. It is there. I shall find mine order.
[4680.57s -> 4688.39s]  Is this it? Travel the path of the Lord. And once all is done, we shall see each other
[4689.11s -> 4703.22s]  once more. All right, very cool. Where's my reward? Here it is. Dark moon great sword.
[4703.46s -> 4722.97s]  Dude, this is so but 16 strength. What is this? It's this. It's the from software weapon.
[4723.69s -> 4732.87s]  This is how you get the moonlight great sword. It's the from software weapon. We found the
[4732.87s -> 4746.50s]  from software weapon. OK, let's take a look at it. It's very pretty, isn't it? It is.
[4752.66s -> 4753.70s]  It is very pretty.
[4754.42s -> 4766.97s]  That does not use manna, by the way. How long does it last? Oh, looks really cool here.
[4768.17s -> 4789.11s]  I don't think you have an option here. I mean, I think I do have an option considering I need 16
[4789.11s -> 4803.51s]  strength, which I'm going to have the intelligence for it is the intelligence weapon. Yeah, but
[4804.47s -> 4811.34s]  intelligence weapon. Yeah, but but this is too. You can just two handed.
[4813.45s -> 4816.73s]  Yeah, but then I'm essentially obliterating all my sorcerers.
[4817.93s -> 4828.49s]  But on the strength talisman, this actually lasts a while. All right,
[4828.49s -> 4838.31s]  so what happens if it's just it's just a normal 200? OK, I have some decisions to
[4838.31s -> 4843.59s]  make because this is a big deal. I'm going to give you one reason why I'm not too keen on
[4843.59s -> 4853.10s]  using this item because for the entire video game, I have been I have these swinging patterns
[4853.10s -> 4862.28s]  down with the one handed and even two handed. It's a lot faster. I don't know. I'm going to
[4862.28s -> 4875.69s]  have to get used to this all new swing timing for the big two hander. It's very cool. I don't know.
[4875.69s -> 4886.25s]  I don't know. I don't know. It's a slow swinger. Yeah, I don't know. Well, let me finish this up.
[4886.97s -> 4892.70s]  Let me just continue to do what I was doing here. That also is that going to make me heavy?
[4893.58s -> 4906.31s]  This is important. Guys, I unless I don't have anything in my offhand, this is heavy. It's a heavy
[4906.31s -> 4916.54s]  load. I'd have to start putting points in endurance. I can't have an offhand unless I respect. I don't
[4916.54s -> 4927.90s]  think this is happening. I am more inclined to go into this than I am to that. This thing is pretty
[4927.90s -> 4948.10s]  cool as well. It does this thing. This thing's awesome, but I don't know because that's strength
[4948.10s -> 4956.10s]  into not decks in, but it does. It does skill with decks. It does. And it's frost. All right.
[4956.10s -> 4959.62s]  Well, we're going to have to do a lot of soul searching here. I think. Yeah, it's going to
[4959.62s -> 4964.18s]  take some because this is what I'm going to take into the end game. Whatever I'm taking to the
[4964.18s -> 4971.27s]  second half of this game is what I'm going to be using for the whole game. So this is going to be
[4971.27s -> 4983.75s]  interesting because I actually don't know what to do here. But in the meantime, let's do this.
[4986.42s -> 5003.08s]  Anything else down here? That was really cool. Quest line. In the meantime, I can go further.
[5003.80s -> 5012.52s]  I can go further down. Can I? I can. Wait, didn't I come from down? I think I came from this way.
[5013.24s -> 5026.34s]  Yeah, okay. I did. What if I go back to Ren's rise? That's a good idea. You're going to get
[5026.34s -> 5032.58s]  plenty of materials to spec several weapons really high. Yeah, but if this is like the other
[5032.58s -> 5038.97s]  from software games, and I'm imagining it is because instant kill move, if it's like the other
[5038.97s -> 5047.72s]  from software games, there's probably only like three or four of like the plus 10 or plus 20,
[5047.72s -> 5054.90s]  whatever item. So I'm imagining there's probably less than five or less than maybe even it was.
[5054.90s -> 5061.16s]  There was two in each playthrough of Bloodborne. I remember like the super gigantic plus 10 item.
[5061.16s -> 5070.12s]  I imagine there's probably two or three. There are more than four is four. Okay,
[5070.12s -> 5073.75s]  so it's not like the other ones. Because I remember the other ones. It was like,
[5073.75s -> 5079.90s]  you're going to find maybe two of like the super Titanite mega slabs. And that was it.
[5080.70s -> 5084.78s]  Okay, so there's enough. All right, well, then it then it's not and I'm not worried about it,
[5084.78s -> 5097.83s]  then. I want to keep exploring this area though. And that I didn't. Yeah, I want to check out some
[5097.83s -> 5100.95s]  of this other stuff. Because I'm probably not coming back to this island ever again.
[5107.50s -> 5112.30s]  But if you're wondering how to get the moonlight great sword, like you don't feel like looking at
[5112.30s -> 5126.36s]  a guide. It's Ren's quest line. That was a long winded journey. Get us to a spot that I'm not
[5126.36s -> 5145.66s]  entirely sure. I don't know if I wanted to use it. Okay, well, all right. Oh, golden. Oh,
[5146.78s -> 5167.80s]  is this one single person? It's one single person. Holy shit. Yeah, I did not take that seriously
[5167.80s -> 5176.92s]  enough. Why did I start freaking out? Where's this going to take me? I just like Don Shalani
[5176.92s -> 5182.71s]  just was doing that. Okay. Um, where's this going to take me? Should I do it? Was there a statue?
[5183.19s -> 5201.70s]  Or is this going to take me back way before? I don't know. I don't remember. Okay. Yeah,
[5201.70s -> 5210.17s]  it's here. Well, all right. No, do not do not just nonchalantly walk through that area. I want to,
[5210.17s -> 5224.81s]  I want to be in there. Ooh, that's pretty nice. All right. All right. I want to go underground.
[5224.81s -> 5229.67s]  There's definitely a dungeon here that I'm going to do. And after I do this island, I'm going to go
[5229.67s -> 5238.81s]  do a main story place, which I'm going to go to Caleb, I think, and go up from Caleb. That's my
[5238.81s -> 5247.96s]  plan. You don't like my plan and don't care. All right, let's take this more seriously.
[5255.98s -> 5278.18s]  Oh, my. Okay. I got stuck in the wall. Okay. You can't even be in the game. He's just like
[5278.18s -> 5285.43s]  fucking out and freaking out. Okay. Damn. All right. Well, let's try this again.
[5286.15s -> 5293.85s]  Let me get off the horse. I feel like maybe that's far better. Or is it though?
[5294.49s -> 5310.01s]  So many people spawn here. All right, let's go. Here's all right. Here's behind you.
[5315.98s -> 5338.39s]  Jesus. Oh, he's making the bird sounds by the way. He's making the from software bird reverse
[5338.39s -> 5355.42s]  suck in breathing sound. Holy shit. Dude, I don't even know when I should attack him.
[5356.14s -> 5389.90s]  Strobe into a fucking telephone pole. Fuck man. Where is he? I'm alive. But no, Jesus. Okay.
[5400.76s -> 5407.66s]  I want to kill this guy just because he's fucking irritating. Get off the horse. Oh, I think that
[5407.66s -> 5413.16s]  is guaranteed death. You see how fast this guy moves around and he like teleports. No way you
[5413.16s -> 5431.00s]  fight this guy off the horse. I'll dodge roll once and get killed. Dude. Oh, my God. This is
[5431.00s -> 5444.38s]  harder than some of the bosses. I'm parry him. I don't think there's anything to parry. Look,
[5444.94s -> 5450.22s]  get off the horse, please. I'm telling you right now. I'm going to die in literally one second.
[5451.18s -> 5480.47s]  If I get off the horse, but I'll do it. I can't even fucking take a second to drink.
[5482.06s -> 5502.84s]  I can't even take a sip of my fucking flask. I wish I could summon a friend here.
[5503.56s -> 5511.62s]  All right. We're going to stay on the horse because there's no way I'm going to reliably
[5511.62s -> 5517.06s]  and he'll teleport behind me and kill me and you'll have a complaint and I don't think you
[5517.06s -> 5534.14s]  want to hear me complain. He literally blended into the ground. I can't even get up. What the
[5537.34s -> 5551.05s]  how did he get over that? How did he get over the wall? All right. I'm, I'm thinking I'm taking
[5551.05s -> 5562.71s]  out my, I'm thinking my, my boy, my boy, all legs coming out here. No, you know what?
[5562.71s -> 5597.53s]  Let's bring out the boys. We can be annoying too. Oh shit. Where is he? Where is he? Oh my God.
[5609.18s -> 5629.50s]  Ah, I can't, which enemy is he? No, get away from me. There's so much fucking shit in the way too.
[5629.50s -> 5662.31s]  Like seriously, like how am I supposed to this enemy? Wait, can he get, can he get up here?
[5662.31s -> 5715.29s]  Yeah, he can. Yeah. Mother fucker. When can I even attack him? Fuck off. What an asshole.
[5715.93s -> 5725.67s]  What an asshole of an enemy. Oh, good thing I got the ghost glove or no, no, no, please.
[5741.16s -> 5748.55s]  Ooh, there's a, uh, one of those things. Wash your hands. I, what do you want me to do?
[5749.19s -> 5757.85s]  Okay. I'll wash my, I'll wash up in a minute. What? I'm, I'm, I'm sitting here.
[5761.34s -> 5763.18s]  Wait, you guys want me to go wash my hands?
[5766.74s -> 5775.43s]  Should I go wash my hands? I'm only, no one's touching this besides me and I'm going to clean
[5775.43s -> 5784.44s]  it with alcohol wipes after this. Don't worry. You must, should I go wash my hands?
[5785.16s -> 5789.32s]  What if I, what? No, this is where this is, this is where this goes wrong. If I go wash my hands
[5789.32s -> 5795.99s]  right now, I've grabbed onto this. I need to wash the controller. Did you get it? I have to
[5795.99s -> 5803.14s]  wash the controller too. I'm going to do that afterwards. My monitor is not covered. It's just,
[5803.14s -> 5830.94s]  it looks fine. All right. I want to do this. I don't know why this is here. What? What was that
[5830.94s -> 5863.10s]  for? What was that for? That took a long time. Why did that take so long? All right. Something
[5863.10s -> 5882.23s]  cool. Let's go. It's really an Amber medallion plus two. Holy shit. That's a hundred percent
[5882.23s -> 5929.22s]  more mana vastly raises maximum FP. Wait. Oh, 10. Why is this even in the game? This is the plus
[5929.22s -> 5941.90s]  two version of this. How many levels is 11 FP? So it's 10%. I mean, that's maybe one point,
[5941.90s -> 5962.22s]  maybe two points. Maybe I don't, I wouldn't consider that fast. About two levels.
[5966.33s -> 5972.95s]  That's three or four. It's three or four points. That's, that's really not a big debt, but how
[5972.95s -> 5976.55s]  good some of the other talismans are in the game, there's no reason to put that on ever.
[5978.82s -> 5983.70s]  I could see how that would maybe be okay if you were putting like more than 20, 30 plus points
[5983.70s -> 5990.97s]  in mind, but why would you ever do that? I can't think of a reason why you'd have more than like
[5990.97s -> 6008.78s]  40 points in mind. It's fine. I used to, I used to key for that. You said this fake wall is there.
[6012.47s -> 6032.46s]  Are you fucking with me? Yeah, you're fucking with me. Please. Can you do a quick
[6033.34s -> 6041.88s]  Seinfeld routine about the word vast? What even is vast? What's that supposed to mean? Vast.
[6042.60s -> 6050.20s]  Just say big, just say large, say big. Why do we need names for so why do we have so many names
[6050.20s -> 6085.53s]  to describe what is effectively big? Just say big. Oh my god, it's bear. That was horrible.
[6086.92s -> 6091.90s]  He screamed at me. All right, what was it? There was a couple other places I'm going to go. I'm
[6091.90s -> 6112.63s]  going to go here to, uh, he vastly underperformed. He didn't perform well. He largely underperformed
[6113.27s -> 6119.75s]  the vast ocean. It's a big ocean. The ocean's big. That's a good one. It really is.
[6120.55s -> 6125.94s]  As you know, he would like stay that way. He would move his hand, move his hand like this.
[6126.50s -> 6136.22s]  I don't want to fight this thing. I was going to look at the rooms. Is there something under here
[6136.22s -> 6157.53s]  that has to be, there has to be something here. That's not just look at. Yeah, of course.
[6158.33s -> 6169.74s]  There's something here underneath, under the ground, up above something. Oh, we already.
[6169.74s -> 6177.29s]  Yep. Yep. Nevermind. I already did this. I would do this. Oops. Sorry about that. All right,
[6177.29s -> 6194.81s]  we need to go here and here and okay. Yeah. One and four. Let's go. Oh, yuck. That's going to,
[6194.81s -> 6211.38s]  I'm going to die if I do that. Don't be stupid. I'll go to one and do it. It's Donald and it's
[6211.38s -> 6226.22s]  going to be. Is your shirt drenched? I don't think so. It probably isn't. I haven't been
[6226.22s -> 6239.02s]  playing for that long. Just de-aggro please. My shirt is not drenched. It's fucking fine. See.
[6250.39s -> 6260.22s]  What? Is this a different dragon? Why is he here now? What? Why are there two? Why are there two
[6260.22s -> 6270.41s]  of them? Is this a different person? Well, that, you're not fighting me. Is it a different dragon?
[6270.41s -> 6276.15s]  This one doesn't have a health bar thing. Okay. That's just an enemy, but what?
[6276.87s -> 6286.36s]  That one doesn't have. Oh my God. It is a different dragon. They're everywhere. What?
[6287.77s -> 6302.60s]  I'm sorry, but excuse me. Holy shit. Don't die from that. I'm fine. The island of dragons.
[6304.46s -> 6318.58s]  All right. Now we go this way. Not these guys again. No, you know what? Fuck off.
[6321.32s -> 6325.10s]  No, I'm not fighting any of these people. I do like the
[6328.94s -> 6345.85s]  they make a really cool sound. What are you doing here? This is the island of mini bosses. Okay. I'm
[6346.73s -> 6370.68s]  smithing stone. I'm safe right here. Oh, he's coming in. He's getting in. He's getting in.
[6385.29s -> 6390.78s]  Oh fuck. He got in. He got in. Okay. Now we can't get out. This is perfect.
[6413.64s -> 6441.74s]  What the fuck? This island might be too hard for you. No, that was not that sound. That was
[6441.74s -> 6447.56s]  a different one. There's got to be a better way I can get down here. I don't want to go all the
[6447.56s -> 6460.33s]  way around. That was not the dude. That was the crystal people. The guy with the spear that goes
[6460.33s -> 6472.20s]  wham, wham, wham. That's what he does. It's a different character. Grow up. Okay. Now I'm
[6472.20s -> 6489.27s]  going to wrap around. I'm going to be telling us to grow up. It should be you that grows up.
[6489.27s -> 6497.38s]  I'm already grown up. I'm a grown up. You're not a grown up. I'm a grown up. I'm just a
[6497.38s -> 6516.38s]  spell off the edge. I've got to go all the way around. There's no safe way. And what? Be old
[6516.38s -> 6522.78s]  like you? I'm not even old. You can say that in five years. Because then, you know, I'll be into
[6522.78s -> 6542.55s]  my early 40s. But I'm not old right now. I'm a young man. I'm into skateboarding. Okay, I don't
[6542.55s -> 6549.96s]  want to get killed here. That's 20,000 souls. I got to go get it. God, I can't just leave it.
[6551.56s -> 6562.68s]  That'd be such a, but like what a like fucking idiot that would be. Motherfucking idiot. That
[6562.68s -> 6581.66s]  would be if I didn't go get these souls. What level is the character? 74? 25? Why are my souls
[6581.66s -> 6602.33s]  over here? Didn't I die like way the other way? Oh, I forgot to get eye drops. There's other items
[6602.33s -> 6616.02s]  that I got to get there too. Remember, you're stuck in your ways. Um, I don't think so.
[6621.64s -> 6631.27s]  I thought he just jumped off the cliff. He did. Can they not jump off the cliff? Will he not fall
[6631.27s -> 6649.16s]  off? They like programmed that in. Don't fuck with me. I just want the stones. He's just right behind
[6649.16s -> 6657.10s]  me. Okay, now we go down to the church because there's definitely something there. I'm not
[6657.10s -> 6672.30s]  fighting this guy. Are you actually going to follow me down here? What's the Elden Ring? Does it let
[6672.30s -> 6677.00s]  you fly? I don't think you can fly when you put on the Elden Ring. I'm not even sure what the
[6677.00s -> 6685.08s]  Elden Ring is. The Elden Ring might just be a like theory or something like a myth. It probably is
[6685.08s -> 6708.95s]  no Elden Ring. How could something like that powerful be able to exist? Okay, I believe so
[6708.95s -> 6721.40s]  here we are. What is this? We have a Bobby Hill impression. I'll try. Yeah. Hey dad, I'm sorry.
[6721.40s -> 6729.69s]  I can't, but I tried. Seek three great wise turtles. Seek three wise turtles.
[6729.69s -> 6743.32s]  I hate having to face game one. Could they be anywhere on the whole island?
[6744.50s -> 6752.65s]  Because if that's the case, then I'm just going, I'm just going to fucking... Does this count? No,
[6752.65s -> 6758.44s]  this is not, this is not a magical turtle. It could be anywhere on the whole island. Are you kidding me?
[6759.40s -> 6768.78s]  They are everywhere. They can be anywhere on the whole island. Dude, there's not a chance I'm going
[6768.78s -> 6800.57s]  to do this. Three. Okay, I need to find three. Oh my goodness, I found one. What am I supposed to do
[6800.57s -> 6828.18s]  about it? I can't target it. I can't target it. That's so sad. Oh, there's one. If they're that big,
[6828.18s -> 6830.98s]  then they have to be around there then. All right, I'm just going to go around the perimeter.
[6832.63s -> 6844.25s]  What a pain in the ass. I also need to do this too. People are going to think I'm nuts, but I don't
[6844.25s -> 6876.14s]  care. There was one here. I'm going to just mark where I've been because I will just walk in circles.
[6876.14s -> 6893.64s]  There's nothing here. All right, where's this on the map? All right, there's nothing here or there.
[6903.13s -> 6933.50s]  Okay, nothing here. I don't see anything over all the way over here.
[6944.12s -> 6968.98s]  Yeah, that's nothing, man. You're stressing me out, dude. And this should be not stressing you
[6968.98s -> 6984.87s]  out because I'm actually marking where I've actually seen. Look at the other towers down
[6984.87s -> 6994.01s]  here. So why are you assuming that they're all on the edge? I don't know because they're huge
[6994.81s -> 7001.72s]  and that's really I can't think of any other place to hide them. It's one of these things.
[7015.99s -> 7025.03s]  Okay. Okay, so take a look at this. I can see this whole line. I don't see anything on this edge.
[7025.59s -> 7033.14s]  Nothing here. Oh my god. Fuck this. This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[7034.02s -> 7046.97s]  I removed this. I don't want to individually. It's gonna be such a huge pain in the ass to
[7046.97s -> 7053.77s]  individually remove all these. I don't want to remove all markers. I have stuff marked that I
[7053.77s -> 7084.84s]  don't want removed. Okay, we're gonna go over there. But this thing is here. Let's go. What's
[7084.84s -> 7110.76s]  this? It's a boss, right? Electro black knife ring leader. Holy shit, dude. Jesus. Okay. Well,
[7110.76s -> 7120.54s]  that was interesting. Okay, didn't feel like didn't feel like he wanted to stop attacking.
[7120.54s -> 7132.79s]  I feel like this is a backstab encounter. Maybe like a backstab. 18k souls gone. They're right
[7132.79s -> 7151.48s]  here. They're right there. All right, this guy's got some moves. We'll try the we'll try some of
[7151.48s -> 7167.03s]  the intelligence explosions. It's pretty that's pretty good. I think I can get a backstab. But
[7167.11s -> 7179.72s]  holy fucking moly. Holy shit. All right. So when he jumps in the air like that, that's when you go
[7179.72s -> 7210.65s]  around. That's when you get the backstab. You dodge through it. And then wham. Dude,
[7215.03s -> 7218.15s]  he's a cool dad. This is cool. This is kind of like, oh, hey, look, this is a boss right here.
[7230.49s -> 7249.94s]  Well, I didn't get it. I don't think I was close enough. We're done. Wow, that that lasts a long
[7249.94s -> 7267.82s]  time. That lasts a lot longer than I thought it did. Dude, fucking stop swinging at me.
[7271.19s -> 7313.91s]  No, I got it wrong. No, I went for it. All right, I'll get it done. Yeah, you can't.
[7315.10s -> 7319.50s]  You cannot get the amount of iframes needed to dodge that attack. So you have to run.
[7320.62s -> 7345.74s]  Summon somebody. Not until I understand what this guy's all about. They don't seem to give
[7345.74s -> 7352.74s]  you very many opportunities to attack this guy. I can't summon. Oh, I think this is going to be
[7352.74s -> 7381.50s]  one of those fights where I just run away. Damn, but I had it. Jesus, what the fuck?
[7382.22s -> 7400.44s]  That's huge. That's a massive area. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna try parrying a little parry shield.
[7410.36s -> 7428.46s]  What shield is the best parry? I'm not sure it matters. You need a buckler. Don't go there
[7428.46s -> 7437.27s]  without touching that. I'll try him one or two more times. Try parry him. He just he's very
[7437.27s -> 7442.46s]  elaborate with his moves. He does a lot of just regular swings. I wonder how effective it'll be.
[7442.46s -> 7464.12s]  Let's find out. That was weird. Cute. Time to do that. Jesus, man. He's just it's just almost no
[7464.12s -> 7488.57s]  opportunity to attack him. If I could get the parry is just whatever. I just want to get a
[7488.57s -> 7495.32s]  successful parry so I can know if I can do it later. You should just shoot him. Oh, yeah, I like
[7496.28s -> 7506.60s]  Elden Ring added like machine guns and like like handguns. Got that wrong.
[7513.37s -> 7522.41s]  Swing timings are so all over the place. It's like it's hard to even understand when to do this.
[7523.05s -> 7533.88s]  I could try the guard. No, the guard parry would be horrible because if I did I'm just he just
[7533.88s -> 7546.34s]  attacked me and kill me. I just want to parry him once and that will be my victory and then I'll
[7546.34s -> 7554.71s]  leave. I just need to parry him one time. That's how I win this encounter. That's a victory for me.
[7555.35s -> 7565.46s]  I thought I was gonna die. I thought he was gonna dash forward. No fucking way, dude. This guy's
[7565.46s -> 7587.08s]  unbearable. No way. Five more attempts. That's it. I just want to parry him. Five attempts to
[7587.08s -> 7605.14s]  parry him. That's not what you're betting on, I don't think. Just one parry. All right, get over
[7605.14s -> 7616.81s]  here. It looks like a parry once. That looks pretty good. That looks pretty good. Didn't it,
[7616.81s -> 7625.64s]  though? I don't understand. I don't know how you get away from that. I really don't get it.
[7625.64s -> 7649.72s]  What do you do? Good fucking luck. I didn't mean to press the button twice. I just did.
[7650.60s -> 7660.94s]  No fucking way. Okay, if you if you can parry this guy like three or four times in a row and
[7660.94s -> 7666.14s]  like not get hit, you're from a different planet. You have to be. I would actually like start to
[7666.14s -> 7673.59s]  contemplate like what potential alien species you could be. Now I'd be like I have fucking super
[7673.59s -> 7691.42s]  human intelligence. I must be from a different planet. I have to be. Yes, but what is your
[7691.42s -> 7698.10s]  reasoning for trying to join the Mensa Academy? The streamer said he was going to meet around a
[7698.10s -> 7703.22s]  bunch of people told me that I had a super genius IQ because I could parry this boss and Elden wing
[7703.22s -> 7713.14s]  three times in a row. Any mathematics or any English or any medical background? No. I just
[7713.14s -> 7717.22s]  got shit faced one night and was able to parry this guy three times and this streamer told me
[7717.22s -> 7739.67s]  who's the streamer? What are you talking about? I don't think you can. I don't think you can.
[7740.47s -> 7750.82s]  Can you parry him? Like, I mean, at some point you just like guess at some point. Jesus.
[7751.54s -> 7761.26s]  At some point just guess. I'm not even trying to fight the boss. Those are the bit what's he doing?
[7762.54s -> 7766.06s]  I'm just trying to parry. That's the only thing I'm doing and I'm leaving when I get
[7766.70s -> 7774.12s]  one. People people come to the stream and they see a guy like I don't understand what's happening.
[7774.12s -> 7777.00s]  It's like that's what happens. You give your friend the control. You're like hey play Elden
[7777.00s -> 7784.26s]  ring. They're going to be like what's uh what do I do man? What should I go? I'm telling you I'm
[7784.26s -> 7811.43s]  just practicing parrying. This guy's fucking moves are impossible to predict. What? I mean honestly
[7811.43s -> 7832.02s]  though like holy shit man it's fucking crazy. I'm gonna I'm not leaving until I get a parry once.
[7832.90s -> 7841.90s]  I'm not leaving this area until I like get it. I just want and then I'm going to alt f for the
[7841.90s -> 7882.09s]  game and then come back right with one eye. It'll be easier. Fine. I looked like I hit it.
[7884.31s -> 7913.51s]  That second one I think I hit it. I don't think I can parry him. He's a smaller shield. Okay.
[7913.99s -> 7945.03s]  Last try. Last try. That's it and I'm not coming back. No. Fuck you. No I'm going out. I'm going
[7945.03s -> 7987.80s]  out on my own terms. Hey wait where does it say my souls are? Wait why am I all the way over here?
[7987.80s -> 8004.81s]  I oh I chose the bonfire. Fuck. Oh well that's it. I'm not going back. I'm not going back to that
[8004.81s -> 8023.11s]  guy ever again. Jumping by past the stake. Oh that sucks. I still where just tell me what the
[8023.11s -> 8027.34s]  turtles are. I don't even care. I'm not gonna sit around for four hours looking around this
[8027.34s -> 8030.38s]  whole island for the turtles. Where are the other two turtles? Tell me. I just tell me where they
[8030.38s -> 8046.25s]  are. I don't want I don't care. No I want four hours of suffering. Just tell I just where are
[8046.25s -> 8050.33s]  the turtles? Where are they? Somebody said one of them's flying. That would be really funny but I
[8050.33s -> 8060.46s]  don't I don't think I believe you. Why are they throwing frisbees at me? Stop. One is literally
[8060.46s -> 8075.78s]  flying. No it's not. What is this? Is that gonna kill me? Okay I was supposed to be so upset.
[8076.42s -> 8102.39s]  What is that one? What's that for? Wait could I where was that? Why is it gone? What the fuck
[8102.39s -> 8127.91s]  is it for? Mark that. Where is it? Fortnite bounce pad dude. I just need to get down there.
[8127.91s -> 8142.86s]  I just need to get down there. Get down there. I just walked up the edge. I just want to go down.
[8144.02s -> 8163.99s]  Thank you. All right where's the turtle? Where is he? Tell me now. There's a shitload of turtles
[8163.99s -> 8185.82s]  right here. Why are there so many turtles here? Seal on the rise opened. What? What's the rise?
[8195.14s -> 8225.88s]  I did it? I did it. I did? Aren't there three? You broke the encounter. Oh all right what did I do?
[8226.76s -> 8232.63s]  It was no it was three. It was three turtles. It says find three wise beasts. One big or it's three
[8232.63s -> 8239.08s]  small turtles or one big turtle. Where was the big turtle? Wasn't the big turtle on the cliff?
[8240.12s -> 8254.10s]  I'm very confused how I'm allowed in here right now. It was in the air.
[8254.10s -> 8269.35s]  I didn't see it. This is kind of a spooky place. They were in the sky. Oh it's on my head.
[8270.52s -> 8297.26s]  Um a bug or something. I wonder what this was all for. It's gonna be for
[8297.26s -> 8319.90s]  or something. That's gold and he's dark moon. 68 intelligence at 45.
[8320.62s -> 8331.21s]  Uses the caster as oh it's the thing where you go into the moon. That um that caster boss.
[8332.09s -> 8343.69s]  I wonder how good that is. All right I think I've pretty much fully explored this island.
[8344.50s -> 8348.50s]  There's like three dragons here but I don't care. I'm not gonna fight them right now
[8349.46s -> 8363.46s]  or ever. So time to make a decision. Up from Kaleid or kind of up right from the uh manor.
[8363.46s -> 8376.54s]  Carry manor. I have two choices here. Up from Kaleid or right. You know I don't I actually
[8376.54s -> 8385.82s]  don't even really care. I would do either one of these. I'm gonna take a quick quick pee break.
[8386.38s -> 8397.98s]  Let me get a poll in chat. Right from manor. Up from Kaleid. Right from manor which is this way
[8397.98s -> 8405.32s]  or up from Kaleid. Get a poll going. I'll take a quick BRB. Gonna pee. Gonna refill my drink.
[8405.32s -> 8823.29s]  And I'll see you guys in a bit. See you in like two minutes. I got 50 subs an hour ago. Rock Lee.
[8823.29s -> 8833.22s]  Thank you. That's a lot. I still owe subs which maybe I'll try that again. Hopefully I got that
[8833.22s -> 8844.06s]  sorted too but we'll see. So where are we going? What are the uh what was the general consensus?
[8846.09s -> 8868.98s]  63% said up from Kaleid. Okay. Okay. Sounds like plan. 27% said uh hard to do do.
[8869.62s -> 8892.14s]  That wasn't an option so sorry. Right. Sound effects on. And we go. So up from Kaleid.
[8892.14s -> 8902.84s]  That sounds like plan. Very cool. Very interested. Also according to the notes,
[8905.78s -> 8909.78s]  the dragon no we're already we're there. That's just that's not gonna happen.
[8910.94s -> 8918.46s]  That's way later. Kaleid's not dragon barrel. I really hope this bowling pin isn't gonna be your
[8918.46s -> 8923.50s]  hat always. I don't know. I don't know. It's by far the best intelligence hat that I found so far
[8923.50s -> 8931.54s]  because specifically it does not reduce my stamina like the other ones do. All right let's go. I'm
[8931.54s -> 8955.42s]  just gonna go up from here. So this way which would be actually this way. All right. Okay let's
[8955.42s -> 8972.63s]  go. Swamp of Aeonia. Yeah really can I go this way? This is rot. This is another rot area. Okay
[8972.63s -> 8985.45s]  it's not. Oh I remember these guys. Yeah I was freaking out about these guys before.
[9002.12s -> 9046.70s]  He's dropping gold. Uh-huh. Okay. Come here. Mm-hmm. It's just like the rabbit from Mario 64.
[9046.70s -> 9051.66s]  What? Fuck. Oh scarlet rot. Wait. Stand over here. Where is he? What's this pattern?
[9061.37s -> 9091.51s]  Where this pattern is? So wait. Hold on. Am I stupid? What? Am I stupid? I'm going up here
[9091.51s -> 9106.06s]  is what I can actually see. I mean obviously right like come on. What the fuck happened?
[9107.00s -> 9129.13s]  What? Oh I had scarlet rot. I'm so locked in. Stop by the shack at the southern gate.
[9129.77s -> 9164.42s]  Okay. What if I like block? Where are you going? Where are you going? What? You don't go this way
[9164.42s -> 9248.26s]  anymore? Fuck you. What? I don't get it. Come here you little shit. Got him. Poison armament.
[9248.26s -> 9265.53s]  Uh-oh. Fellas. Hold on. Poison armament. Oh all right. I gotta go up that way I think right.
[9265.53s -> 9277.50s]  It's useless. Is it? It's useless? All right. I'm going kind of the right way but I almost
[9277.50s -> 9287.70s]  want to go that way. I want to follow the uh golden thing. Celia tower of sorcery.
[9288.26s -> 9300.65s]  What's wrong here? I can't go this way. I guess not. So this is like I guess progression but
[9300.97s -> 9327.11s]  I can't go in there. Why not? Why not? Shit. I can't go in here.
[9329.74s -> 9346.94s]  Are you firing at me? You can go up there. All right. I'm gonna do some rooftop jumping here.
[9346.94s -> 9425.18s]  Is that a hole? Oh yes. Hi. I'm Sigurd. All up there. My god. All right. Stop. Stop. All right.
[9440.07s -> 9485.40s]  Oh fuck. Get the fuck out of here dude. Stop. I just want to get up here. What's in here? Another
[9485.40s -> 9505.00s]  entrance I can't get in. You are such a shitty little enemy too and like I get out of here with
[9505.00s -> 9519.61s]  this bullshit and you disappeared too. I gotta get back on the roof. I want to go get those items.
[9519.61s -> 9562.44s]  Item Andy. Item Andy. Item Andy. I know. Okay back to the tree. Fuck. I think I can do it from here.
[9563.08s -> 9575.21s]  If I didn't have somebody up my ass I would be able to do it. I didn't have somebody constantly
[9575.21s -> 9592.04s]  up my ass I'd be able to do it. I can't stop. My god. I didn't fall off the fucking roof to
[9592.04s -> 9599.43s]  begin with. If the horse didn't have to make a gigantic 10 meter circle if he wanted to turn
[9599.43s -> 9633.59s]  around. Pain in the ass. I fucking hate these guys. I just want to get on the fucking roof.
[9633.59s -> 9637.59s]  I just get me on the roof. I'm just gonna go all the way back to where I was before
[9637.67s -> 9642.47s]  and just get up there. Like it's just I'm getting out of this foggy bullshit and I'm
[9642.47s -> 9653.50s]  just gonna go from here. Oh my god. Fuck all of you. Look you're a dumb ass little whatever.
[9653.50s -> 9674.94s]  I can't get up there. So I'm gonna don't even fucking think about it. Don't even think about it.
[9691.18s -> 9695.82s]  Hit him. Get off. Oh no no no. Thank you. I appreciate that you actually helped me. That
[9695.82s -> 9705.27s]  actually helped. That would have been very mad. Okay there's a ladder right there. I don't give a
[9705.27s -> 9709.83s]  shit about it. Never mind. Fuck the items. Nope. How dare you say fuck the items. Item Andy.
[9710.63s -> 9732.01s]  That guy's gonna fuck this whole thing up because he's gonna throw a grenade or whatever.
[9737.96s -> 9756.65s]  Oh nice. Worth it. Worth. It's worth it. Worth it. What's this? Oh light a fire.
[9757.53s -> 9766.25s]  Seal was broken in town. Ah. So that's how you do it. Okay so there's another one over there.
[9766.81s -> 9793.91s]  So I have to destroy the magical seal. I'm so impatient. Fuck it right? Okay. That's hard to
[9793.91s -> 9834.07s]  get up through. What's that? Red main painting. Oh shit. All right. Holy shit. What the? I'm gonna
[9834.07s -> 9837.91s]  just spawn a hundred times. It's you. Good. Now you get to die and you get to die too.
[9838.55s -> 9860.26s]  He's alive? All right. All right. All right. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave.
[9861.30s -> 9948.06s]  I can get that. I'm certain of it. Hey. Well we're going that way. He's not enjoying this game at
[9948.06s -> 9958.95s]  all. You can tell. No actually I that's completely opposite. He's not enjoying the game at all.
[9960.09s -> 9964.73s]  Like he's just he's just desperately trying to fucking hold it together before like freaking out
[9964.73s -> 9971.90s]  on stream one day. As you can tell he's just holding it in. He wants to so badly fucking talk
[9971.90s -> 9978.22s]  about how he hates this. Hates what he's doing. He hates streaming this game. He fucking hates the
[9978.22s -> 9987.86s]  game. It looks like there's a lot of these so I don't know how many of these I'm supposed to be
[9987.86s -> 10020.39s]  doing. I have two. Oh I got it. Double slash. Seal's broken up there. There's one more that
[10020.39s -> 10033.40s]  I'm gonna go get which is over here and then I'm just gonna go in the front door. Easy snipe. Easy
[10033.40s -> 10049.16s]  snipe. Hell yeah. I'm not sure I can get this one from here. Holy shit that's a that's a face.
[10050.86s -> 10072.28s]  Holy crap. Um well a little awkward. A little awkward but whatever. I'm just gonna go in the
[10072.28s -> 10083.05s]  front door. Holy crap dude. Yeah holy crap. Would you guys rather I say holy crap or like say like
[10083.77s -> 10097.16s]  fuck. Which one's like you think more appropriate. I'm just gonna go in the front door. I don't want
[10097.16s -> 10104.44s]  to just be like swear guy you know what I mean. I'm gonna start saying like holy shoot. Oh my god.
[10104.44s -> 10113.48s]  Oh my goodness. Holy what the oh crap. Um there's a chest just sitting here.
[10118.41s -> 10127.72s]  Night comet. Holy crap. That was a genuine holy crap. That one was genuine I can promise you.
[10129.08s -> 10143.96s]  That was a genuine holy crap. Holy crap a night comet. All right well let's do this. I got this
[10143.96s -> 10150.55s]  one open. I got another one open too. Should I do the one that's lower? This one down uh downtown.
[10150.55s -> 10157.86s]  Why am I saying downtown. You know what I mean. I do need a map fragment which is
[10158.58s -> 10174.01s]  here. Why is my point pointing that way. Um excuse me. Go up this way now go that way.
[10177.08s -> 10193.10s]  What are you talking about. Please do your best Australian action accent. Uh no no I'm not gonna
[10193.90s -> 10226.20s]  no no. It's so funny accents like people just get so rage filled if like someone's doing an
[10226.20s -> 10235.16s]  accent and they don't sound like their neighbor. You know what I mean. Wait is he doing an Australian
[10235.16s -> 10242.58s]  accent. Oh he doesn't sound like my fucking neighbor mate. Get him. But it's just an accent.
[10242.58s -> 10269.77s]  It's just an accent. It's just an impression. What the hell. Okay pay attention. I'm getting
[10269.77s -> 10300.15s]  double attacked. Don't let him put himself back together. Did you do Jack Sparrow.
[10302.63s -> 10328.25s]  I'm done. Oh my career is over. I'm ending my career. It's over today. Listen I have two
[10328.25s -> 10333.58s]  headphones in. All right let me explain. The reason why I never have two headphones in is because I
[10333.58s -> 10340.25s]  can't hear myself talk. When there are two headphones in I can't hear myself speak and
[10340.25s -> 10346.01s]  it kind of speech jams me and messes up pretty much everything. So I don't I don't know how I
[10346.01s -> 10352.01s]  sounded right there but I know it sounded. I imagine a walrus with like a big mustache that
[10352.01s -> 10359.54s]  goes like this. Like when he's talking. Does that make sense? That's like all I heard and that's all
[10359.54s -> 10371.43s]  I saw. That's the only thing I could think of. Okay I can get on top of the building.
[10392.42s -> 10404.76s]  No. Yo grace from the last you grace. God he sucks. She's quiet. He sucks. I'm like
[10404.76s -> 10412.01s]  I'm trying to jump across the building. No I actually I don't suck. Excuse you.
[10412.97s -> 10445.05s]  What the fuck just happened? Okay I can't you can't make that jump. It looks like you can.
[10445.05s -> 10451.78s]  It actually looks like you can make the jump. What the fuck I didn't want to go to the statue.
[10452.34s -> 10467.13s]  It's probably another way around. I thought it was possible to make the jump if you did it like
[10467.13s -> 10475.50s]  perfectly or something. So there's another way to get up there which is probably I actually don't
[10475.50s -> 10499.64s]  know. You can't go from here. Maybe you can. Okay whatever. All right let's keep going. So
[10502.79s -> 10520.02s]  I need to go where do I go from here? That way? This way up around? All right let's continue our
[10520.02s -> 10537.54s]  trek through Elden Ring. Items though hold on. Maybe probably that way but let's just go. He
[10537.54s -> 10543.14s]  was dying in such comically avoidable ways. Well but I mean if you're okay but I'm exploring.
[10543.94s -> 10551.83s]  I am exploring the game. So of course I'm gonna fall down somewhere if I'm like if I've ever been
[10551.83s -> 10555.91s]  there and I'm gonna try to jump up there or something. Like what? I'm a huge Breath of the
[10555.91s -> 10560.07s]  Wild fan. One of the cool things about Breath of the Wild was like you could actually go wherever
[10560.07s -> 10565.27s]  you wanted. It wasn't like oh you have to go here you have to go there. That's why this game I'm
[10565.27s -> 10572.52s]  like comparing it to B-O-T-W. But um you can just kind of explore and that's what I like about this
[10572.52s -> 10608.06s]  game. So that's how I'm gonna play it. Okay what? That was very odd. Is it still there?
[10609.29s -> 10618.42s]  Why do I feel like it's still up there? Don't you feel like it's still up there and it's gonna
[10618.42s -> 10658.30s]  reappear? El Balo. I can't wait till it's actually a boss. If El Balo is really a boss with a health
[10658.30s -> 10682.87s]  bar and it plays like that. El Balo. Will you officiate? I'm not officiating any weddings.
[10683.59s -> 10703.03s]  Is it? Oh yes. One second. Oh my gosh. One second. I'm looking at something. Oh safe safe safe safe
[10703.03s -> 10715.06s]  safe safe safe. There's a person here. Okay hold on. Let me look. Let me see. What have we got? What
[10715.06s -> 10721.34s]  have we got? What have we got? What have we got? Hey hey I'm trying to hold on. I'm looking at like
[10721.34s -> 10746.01s]  what's I'm looking at food. Stop. No I have to just touch that thing. Okay all right. Oh the oh the
[10746.01s -> 10750.25s]  old girlfriend wants to ask what you want for food to get you killed in Elden Ring shtick.
[10750.89s -> 10759.93s]  Honey it didn't work. All right hold on. Give me one second. I want to actually look at this.
[10759.93s -> 10798.09s]  Yeah okay of course. Of course my usual order. Usual order. Five McChickens. Extra blue cheese.
[10806.54s -> 10808.79s]  All right there's somebody here.
[10830.28s -> 10840.63s]  He's pretending he has a girlfriend. Hold on guys. I gotta check. I gotta check in with the
[10840.63s -> 10849.08s]  girlfriend instead of making it up. Why am I just making that up? That's so fucking. That would be
[10849.08s -> 10863.40s]  weird. Okay so this person. Is there like a cure I can give this person? Oh what's this?
[10864.04s -> 10887.72s]  Okay well I don't think there's nothing else here. Is the mic audio fucked up today?
[10887.72s -> 10896.86s]  It shouldn't be. I don't know. I don't think so. All right that's good. Did I actually get enough
[10896.86s -> 10908.09s]  to do this? Four golden seeds. Damn it. Okay so you're infected with scarlet rot. I've actually
[10908.09s -> 10927.77s]  made my way to a road which is pretty pog. Oh spells right. Like I got. Oh no no no. I need 68
[10928.33s -> 10943.62s]  intelligence to use it. How close am I to actual 52 though? Would I rank Elden Ring? You mean like
[10943.62s -> 10950.58s]  on the the. What are we gonna call these now? Right? Before it was like Dark Souls. Souls like
[10950.58s -> 10958.07s]  or Souls game. Then Bloodborne came out and it became a Souls born game. Sekiro came out which
[10958.71s -> 10966.95s]  wasn't really a kind of Souls kind of game. It was close. But this one is. Are we gonna call these like
[10967.91s -> 10975.43s]  Souls brings? Souls Soulsbrings? All right what do I rank this on the Soulsbring
[10975.43s -> 10987.27s]  franchises? Soldenbring. Solden. Soldenbringborn. Soldenbrorn. Soldenbringer.
[10987.27s -> 11004.01s]  Ringborner. Soldenbring. I don't know. So soft. Souls. Souls. Soul. Soulbringborn. I like. Okay.
[11004.01s -> 11012.62s]  Soulbringborn is good. I don't know. Probably like one or two. I want to pass the time because I'm
[11012.62s -> 11029.30s]  curious if she dies. Still all right? Well you seem to be fine. Perfectly fine from this morning. So
[11030.02s -> 11040.65s]  you need to go to the shack. Oh all right well I don't know where the shack is.
[11040.65s -> 11053.85s]  Is it on the map? Find the shack. Oh that's a grave. What's that? Is that a shack?
[11054.57s -> 11087.35s]  Don't fucking die please. Oh not fighting you. I think there's an NPC here. South of the town.
[11100.10s -> 11103.98s]  You're screaming because you're gonna get hit by that. That's like what I do.
[11116.86s -> 11142.31s]  So there's an NPC here. That's not an NPC. Whatever. What do you got? There's something weird over
[11142.31s -> 11172.89s]  there though. What's that? Look at this game. This game's Drawstring Poison Grease. That was a fully
[11172.89s -> 11193.08s]  charged art too. Feels good when you hit that shit. What is? Oh that's. Oh okay. That's where the
[11193.08s -> 11199.67s]  festival was and then we fought down there. Okay I get it. This game's fucking. Never mind. I don't
[11199.67s -> 11209.21s]  want to be an idiot. I don't know what's going on here but there's butterflies. Your thinking face
[11209.21s -> 11220.73s]  looks dumb. Let's see your thinking face. I don't know why that got me. That got me. That got me.
[11220.73s -> 11226.74s]  Like I don't know. I don't know why that got me. That got me angry. I don't understand why but like
[11226.74s -> 11230.74s]  it did and it tilted me to a point where I got killed in the middle of that. For those guys dying
[11230.74s -> 11258.52s]  one hit. I don't know what's safe and what's not safe to fall. All right let's go. There's a clown
[11258.52s -> 11281.77s]  on the top right of your screen. Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where do we go? Where do we go?
[11287.86s -> 11330.98s]  Big guy. Oh big guy. No problem. Why is nobody spamming that? You guys get over that in one day?
[11331.62s -> 11344.78s]  You guys you guys got over that in literally 24 hours. Oh Omega Love. What an old meme that is.
[11344.78s -> 11362.73s]  That was yesterday. Something up here. I don't think so. This is bringing me just back to where
[11362.73s -> 11377.10s]  all the the dog man farming fighting is. Look okay that looks like a shack.
[11378.94s -> 11386.52s]  What else looks like a shack here? This could be a shack. I mean maybe one of these something
[11386.52s -> 11396.82s]  over here could look maybe be a shack. Something right here could be a shack. I don't see anything
[11396.82s -> 11410.54s]  here that's shack like. This could be it's a it's a shack like over here. Oh my goodness we're fine.
[11411.02s -> 11416.50s]  All right so you mean like right here? Like over this way? That looks like shack right there.
[11417.54s -> 11423.00s]  I think that's a shack. I think we found the shack. I think we found it.
[11424.84s -> 11448.66s]  I did everything. You didn't do anything. I found it. Not we. Me. I did. There are two of you?
[11449.62s -> 11467.16s]  That's weird. Oh you're invisible. Oh another goal. I gotta I can definitely level up again.
[11467.80s -> 11476.95s]  You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of um a neverhood. Stuff like that.
[11477.59s -> 11487.21s]  Those big bulb almost like clay like trees. Okay so I gotta go up here and apparently the
[11487.21s -> 11506.55s]  shack is right there. I mean this looks like a shack. It might not be. Okay that that I thought
[11506.55s -> 11530.28s]  I looked like it could be an NPC. Who's not an NPC? I have no mana. We don't need it. Swamp
[11530.28s -> 11546.84s]  lookout tower. Eternal darkness. Oh that's right I did get the I got the uh the knight comment
[11548.38s -> 11561.86s]  and uh okay cool. What does eternal darkness do? Can I do anything else with this? Maybe I can. Hold
[11561.86s -> 11572.09s]  on. This might be kind of a weird thing to try but whatever. Like it looks like I can get in there.
[11574.97s -> 11584.74s]  Yeah look see on the tree. Can I climb the tree and jump from the top or does it just look cool?
[11590.86s -> 11606.94s]  All right that's not the shack. It's a cool tower. This I guess this is a good vantage point.
[11610.78s -> 11626.10s]  That a shack right there. That could look it'll be like a shack.
[11630.47s -> 11674.62s]  Just south of town it's in the canyon. But like here? Shack? Shack probably down here.
[11674.62s -> 11697.21s]  All right shack. Back. Stop by the shack. Is it even on the map? It's not. I mean it kind of is.
[11697.21s -> 11702.18s]  Sort of blends in. Wait how am I supposed to stop by the shack? You have a big dog.
[11702.74s -> 11743.08s]  Okay back time. What do you got? What's here? A pleasure to see you. A pleasure indeed.
[11743.80s -> 11753.62s]  I am Gary a great sage in my day anyway. I'd hoped to ask a favor when one of your ilk came along.
[11753.62s -> 11760.12s]  A strapping young tarnished able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia. Don't fret.
[11760.76s -> 11772.73s]  Should you accept? We'll teach you the secret of Selya, the town you see there. Secret? What do you got?
[11772.73s -> 11778.79s]  Then you are willing to lend a hand are you? I need your help to heal a certain young girl.
[11778.79s -> 11781.67s]  I know where she is. Her name is Millicent.
[11782.31s -> 11788.25s]  The life I sent? No way. Resting at the church atop the cliff.
[11789.22s -> 11798.49s]  Stricken by the rotting sickness. Okay what about her? Rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent
[11798.49s -> 11805.70s]  has no cure. When the earth tree flourished even the demigods could not stave off its effects
[11805.70s -> 11813.03s]  despite their nigh godhood. Millicent's suffering can be eliminated. I have these like pink boogers.
[11813.11s -> 11821.67s]  You are to find a certain needle. Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia outside Selya's hands.
[11821.67s -> 11826.63s]  The needle made from unalloyed gold is lost somewhere. Don't I have it?
[11827.51s -> 11849.62s]  I actually think I have it. Bro I already own it. Here it is. Gold needle. First you must find
[11849.62s -> 11856.86s]  the unalloyed. It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp. Then I will tell you as the secret
[11857.74s -> 11868.68s]  okay that's not the right one so it's in the deep swamp swamp of somewhere deep in the swampy area
[11869.72s -> 11890.86s]  okay cool let's keep going um i think i want to just pour it back here just go up add that to
[11890.86s -> 11915.64s]  the notes yeah deep in the what was it called what he said he said a bunch of words deep in the swamp
[11915.64s -> 11933.32s]  with the scarlet swamp of a whatever he said we all know we get it if you are wise you will my
[11933.32s -> 11942.18s]  flesh bride just rub these pink and purple boogers all over you and you feel fine i think i even have
[11942.18s -> 11972.50s]  one i will go into the mouth crazy these guys don't care crazy looking oh oh that looks cool
[11972.50s -> 11985.74s]  from far away almost that was close if i had spent even one more second caring about that view
[11987.70s -> 11995.42s]  nice try though very nice try all right i definitely can get to there from here can't i
[12001.93s -> 12008.57s]  another one just dropped and i missed it that's where i came from is there a way to go keep going
[12008.57s -> 12018.41s]  up i guess i have to go that way who's rolling the balls i don't know it's a magical ball roller
[12019.21s -> 12031.43s]  but this road there's no more road here oh there's a jumpy all right going this way

[12060.68s -> 12064.04s]  more starlight shards but what am i going to use these for i didn't even look what they did
[12065.35s -> 12072.01s]  the game really wants me to do like a funny little go down here thing look at these platforms
[12072.57s -> 12078.44s]  or is it just one platform and my brain is stupid i think that's what it is no
[12080.33s -> 12102.15s]  why is this here you see i mean like what's the point of these i didn't gatekeeper for those
[12102.15s -> 12117.08s]  returning to the roots what i just do gamer statue what did these do what is that showing

[12466.22s -> 12487.58s]  way touch grass there we go all right you can also level up probably once or twice perfect so
[12487.58s -> 12492.70s]  where dragon barrow far to the east for the other half of that resident evil coin thing
[12493.42s -> 12501.58s]  well it was called it was a fort it's like oh seek fort something right
[12505.90s -> 12512.04s]  fort fort fort for roth fort far off yeah all right that's where we're going i'm gonna find
[12512.04s -> 12531.50s]  that fortune i think i can level up twice because this might be 10 000 we'll find out
[12531.50s -> 12570.07s]  okay i might be a little short yeah i'm a little short okay although let me okay that's definitely
[12570.07s -> 12579.29s]  not a fort this could be that could be okay let me clear the all the shit i have out
[12581.93s -> 12592.98s]  this could be a fort this i don't think that's a fort this looks like it that's probably it right
[12592.98s -> 12599.30s]  there i'm gonna guess it's one of those two i'm also gonna mark this because i want to go to it
[12601.46s -> 12604.98s]  yeah it's definitely two there's no way it's not two but i'm closer to four
[12605.70s -> 12614.17s]  let's just mark all this stuff because i'm gonna be experimenting four is closer so that's where
[12614.17s -> 12636.02s]  i'm gonna go just to see what it is be careful there are dogs among us like a little chat wait

[12743.54s -> 12756.23s]  note gateway port gale in caitlin houses a gateway that leads to red main castle okay there is a
[12756.23s -> 12765.32s]  hidden cave in the town of celia look beyond the graveyard at the precipice okay this painter is
[12765.32s -> 12769.72s]  said to have captured the landscape seen during the last moments of those welcomed into death's
[12769.72s -> 12775.24s]  embrace so the painter and the messages of the dead's last moments can be discovered by visiting
[12775.24s -> 12785.59s]  the location depicted even now these are cool because you have to go find this spot and find
[12785.59s -> 12795.50s]  this exact place find that exact view and it's probably like look down and hit a i think that's
[12795.50s -> 12812.74s]  close that seems close i'll look at it later didn't breath of the wild do this yeah i know b o t w b o
[12812.74s -> 12827.13s]  t w is one of the best games all right so that's that let's go uh i'm gonna go probably not add
[12827.13s -> 12840.14s]  let's go whatever this is lazy but i don't care any chapstick thank you for reminding me appreciate
[12840.14s -> 12862.28s]  that ow all right so now i'm gonna go this way we're just knocking out all the markers just
[12862.28s -> 12889.35s]  because i feel like it that's what we're doing that's what we're going really you got a lot of
[12889.35s -> 12936.74s]  health so what's this thing all right be careful oh he's so scary all the way up divine tower
[12936.74s -> 12943.46s]  there's epic loot tations in there and it activates a great room that's cool what you're saying is
[12943.46s -> 12955.27s]  let's go get up there why does this seem like the bird like the worst and best okay you're supposed
[12956.07s -> 12982.54s]  only shit i oh okay i just like dark souls i pressed the spring button geez this is so
[12982.54s -> 13007.03s]  fucking stressful okay it's gonna get in the way so get rid of it birthday what the 4000th birthday
[13012.15s -> 13028.89s]  where's lanya i've been looking for them the whole game right that is a one of these
[13029.61s -> 13032.97s]  is divine tower of caitlin
[13035.69s -> 13066.26s]  very very very very nice what's in the tower is the question oh let's do this door here oops
[13079.67s -> 13097.42s]  yeah this is going on yeah that's a that activates the great room that's intriguing
[13097.42s -> 13124.82s]  that's intriguing that's intriguing that's intriguing see it you see it i can jump halfway
[13124.82s -> 13133.43s]  into the thing how much longer till you finish the game a very very very long way
[13134.47s -> 13152.34s]  an exceptionally long way store the power of great dan's great ruin what does that one do
[13158.98s -> 13175.67s]  raises maximum hp fp and stamina um okay so this one is okay godric's gives you plus five to all
[13175.67s -> 13187.00s]  stats for dan's gives you increased hp fp and stamina but his five vitality better than the
[13187.00s -> 13194.79s]  max hp you get from this you know what i mean i feel like you get more from this unless this is
[13194.79s -> 13206.89s]  a lot because this is effectively bigger uh mind and endurance whereas this is all of them i wonder
[13206.89s -> 13214.15s]  how wonder how much it actually is to me that would have to be very significant to not use
[13214.15s -> 13231.58s]  the other one that's cool all right so the fort is definitely right there very cool hp is probably
[13231.58s -> 13241.00s]  higher dan is only good once you've hit the soft cap of stats oh that makes sense if you get to
[13241.00s -> 13249.59s]  40 vitality right 40 vigor that makes sense that would be better than not that useful maybe now
[13250.23s -> 13257.99s]  what about the rest of the tower oh there was another way to go you're right i even like
[13257.99s -> 13267.58s]  freaked out about it um let me do this part i mean i'm gonna do this first this has got me this has
[13267.58s -> 13274.04s]  got me hooked this part here there's also the huge dragon here too all right i'm gonna go kill the
[13274.04s -> 13286.01s]  huge dragon i'm gonna go stab the dragon in the face i wonder how much damage it does is this like
[13286.01s -> 13294.25s]  just gary am i gonna die here he he summons a shit load of dragons i'm just gonna die
[13295.21s -> 13321.10s]  so you sneak up in the face jump on top i don't know what to do um can i actually climb on top
[13322.44s -> 13360.02s]  oh that was that was another dragon why they just let me i'm stuck here i think i got the strat
[13360.74s -> 13416.92s]  get away from me oh this is 13 000 damage how believe so i mean i had a kind of a cheese
[13416.92s -> 13426.41s]  ball scrap right there but i wonder if it's maybe i should try how big is he
[13452.55s -> 13459.46s]  all right maybe i should go along his body he'd probably i guarantee it they probably got like a
[13459.46s -> 13474.09s]  big bulbous pimple on their back and i can just whack right it's probably a huge pimple let's go
[13474.25s -> 13501.85s]  find out why is he just why is he all head and neck he's just a huge neck with wings
[13504.20s -> 13539.96s]  where is his body i'm gonna go further up the mountain he's all head and neck his legs are
[13539.96s -> 13556.63s]  gonna be this big and he's gonna have like tiny little feet okay okay there's his head
[13557.51s -> 13571.82s]  he's lying down theoretically his tail should be this way where are my souls i need my souls
[13572.70s -> 13606.34s]  you're just sitting on top of them that's so dumb whatever okay i kind of feel i don't like
[13606.34s -> 13642.90s]  doing this i feel bad this actually makes me sad this makes me sad it's a lot of ruins
[13643.78s -> 13662.25s]  stop it i love it in the middle of stop it stop it dude what the fuck come on stop
[13662.25s -> 13682.12s]  literally ruining the game is come to brazil i'm not gonna stop i this is actually stupid should
[13682.12s -> 13690.10s]  i not be doing this for like storyline reasons is there actually a reason why i shouldn't be
[13690.10s -> 13733.58s]  doing this it's a story npc 14 000 damage on a bleed we're getting tired my guy's like all right
[13734.54s -> 13741.69s]  okay my god i feel like i've been chopping wood all day use the rune boost you're right
[13741.69s -> 13781.43s]  holy shit it's gonna be so much more how about both item discovery and rune boost just die
[13782.23s -> 13817.13s]  oh my god i feel like bad that was so sad 64 000 souls a new power is available though
[13819.59s -> 13826.52s]  all right i'm sorry i wouldn't be able to do this it would smell like rotten eggs right here
[13827.24s -> 13832.20s]  it would just smell like just rotting eggs this thing was lying down for probably like a century
[13832.92s -> 13841.00s]  this would kill you like the the power of the smell right here would kill you all right turn
[13841.00s -> 13859.19s]  around port right there unless is it was he lying on top of something right item or something
[13859.75s -> 13869.56s]  doesn't look like it i was seeing if there's an item here new power is available i wonder what
[13869.56s -> 13881.91s]  that is and here's the port all right now we're gonna be able to combine that coin once i get
[13881.91s -> 13889.13s]  it whatever's here or you can go kill stuff with that buff activated you know what you're
[13889.13s -> 13896.14s]  absolutely right but yeah you're right you're absolutely right let's go hold it still a minute
[13896.94s -> 13928.02s]  port harov yeah absolutely kill stuff hurry up this whole room is filled with fucking
[13928.02s -> 13970.25s]  dirt what is going on that's a beefy guy all right we're off i'm not gonna lose the souls

[14043.00s -> 14067.34s]  no reason not to so i can just see what's going on in this freaking room i'm dirty my eyes
[14068.14s -> 14093.61s]  god fucker how come i can't there's no critical there i feel like they should be there's no crit
[14101.46s -> 14132.76s]  he's gonna grab fucking soap soap i think the soap is bait i don't think it actually does anything
[14132.76s -> 14137.72s]  they'll oh look there'll be an enemy in the game that eats the soap there'll be a random person
[14137.72s -> 14144.78s]  that eats the soap and oh bring me soaps bring me 50 soaps that's the only reason why it exists
[14157.88s -> 14176.54s]  gamer doesn't know what to do with soap why is there a drop down here oh here we go
[14177.10s -> 14185.83s]  it's gonna be the coin nectis medallion right and now that i have them both what do i do with it
[14186.55s -> 14198.57s]  what do i do with it i wonder oh well there might be something over there
[14207.22s -> 14232.18s]  we craft them together yeah um left half is said to reside yeah right half of a split medallion
[14232.98s -> 14237.93s]  left half of a split medallion do you have to bring it to somebody
[14239.29s -> 14262.97s]  yep okay be the blacksmith that's what i'm thinking too maybe maybe the blacksmith will
[14262.97s -> 14292.14s]  say something about it now i'll go ask interesting i'm gonna go down oh we don't care i don't fight
[14292.14s -> 14326.49s]  you guys going down here read the middle part of the item description branching the medallion
[14326.49s -> 14334.57s]  with both halves conjoined will activate the grand lift of dektis connecting the atlas plateau
[14334.57s -> 14357.10s]  to larunia grand lift of dektis grand lift 12 that's i thought they stopped at 10 but where's
[14357.10s -> 14389.69s]  the grand lift of dektis i already got to the atlas plateau yeah grand lift an extra area you can
[14389.69s -> 14422.89s]  jump to i wasn't gonna just run away where over here in the rafters don't let a regular enemy
[14422.89s -> 14444.22s]  kill you okay so i go up here again it's chito off the dirty floor this floor is very clean
[14444.86s -> 14453.75s]  was vacuumed always it's been that put soap carpet soap on it okay so from here
[14455.46s -> 14479.83s]  i jump from here to there what do i just go around this way somehow save chito other ladder
[14480.39s -> 14519.72s]  there's an item right there it's so clean lick the floor then all right back in that rafter area
[14520.44s -> 14542.68s]  down here oh fuck okay let me get hold on wait wait wait i fucking fell down this guy's respawning
[14545.85s -> 14548.57s]  why are they respawning they shouldn't be this is not how this game works
[14552.31s -> 14564.36s]  eat spaghetti off the floor even if it was a clean carpet imagine eating spaghetti off a carpet
[14565.32s -> 14582.25s]  i was just like you know what i'm gonna try to jump to that because there might be something
[14582.25s -> 14585.61s]  there like an item on the edge and it looked like i really could get to it and i didn't think it
[14585.61s -> 14607.24s]  was gonna go that far down it's right here whatever hey there's a gold item in there
[14623.22s -> 14649.80s]  that's the one oh nice very nice the other one right okay so how do i drop down from there
[14649.80s -> 14680.50s]  there that was tough right over there it's over there oh shit i know don't make this joke anymore
[14690.76s -> 14707.16s]  all right so it's underneath me right now so i can just jump from here to there
[14707.80s -> 14725.06s]  i'm gonna get hit by bat in there no i need my starlight a lot of fucking health don't you
[14733.38s -> 14756.30s]  oh fuck all right so that was crazy i'm glad i had the light but what's this
[14756.38s -> 14772.62s]  this adagon's sore seal oh greatly increases attributes but also increases damage taken
[14773.50s -> 14782.07s]  that's a lot that's plus five to how come not intelligence oh because i'm looking at the
[14782.07s -> 14796.50s]  intelligence one right no int it's plus five to everything but not plus five to intelligence why
[14796.50s -> 14815.18s]  not no or mind i wonder what increases damage taken this legendary talisman is an eye engraved
[14815.18s -> 14822.38s]  with an elden rune said to be the seal of king consort radagon greatly raises vigor endurance
[14822.38s -> 14828.20s]  strength and dexterity but also increases damage taken by a similar measure solemn duty weighs upon
[14828.20s -> 14835.90s]  the one who beholden not unlike a gnawing curse i wonder what the damage increases because it's
[14835.90s -> 14841.51s]  a separate one for magic no i guess that makes sense but that was cool all right i cleaned up
[14841.51s -> 14847.94s]  this area a little bit there's a couple things i probably still do where is this pointing me down
[14847.94s -> 14871.82s]  here so i wonder celia deep swamp aeonia or do i try to activate that lift so the world ends here
[14872.46s -> 14887.96s]  so there's no more way to go up this way it's probably a place to go here this is a really
[14887.96s -> 14902.39s]  weird map look at how weird this map is so there's an area here and an area here nothing in the middle
[14902.39s -> 14914.78s]  nothing it's like a big giant like circle it looks like this land right here here right though it's a
[14914.78s -> 14924.22s]  big giant circle it's a ring it's a giant elden ring the the ring is the land it's not a material
[14924.22s -> 14931.10s]  thing it's the elden ring is the the world is really old it's the ring the world is the elden
[14931.10s -> 14959.45s]  ring all right uh like somebody say go back in the tower we did it we beat the game i do want to
[14959.45s -> 14978.06s]  level up one more time though almost there right 39 000 i need a couple how much does this give
[14978.06s -> 14993.78s]  thousand can't go wrong with vitality i just can't i'm gonna take soap off the bar because
[14993.78s -> 15001.30s]  it's kind of fucking me up and this thing is also fucking me up too okay so there's more in here
[15001.30s -> 15013.40s]  somebody said they were like dude go check i was like all right because there's another ladder
[15013.40s -> 15053.14s]  that way let's i'm just gonna go down there who cares because i can't it's gonna be tricky but
[15053.14s -> 15085.34s]  i'll try newman's ruin newman used to gain a multitude of ruins the newman are said to have
[15085.34s -> 15094.07s]  come from outside the lands between in fact of the same stock as queen marika 10 000 20 000
[15094.95s -> 15119.93s]  yeah how much is a multitude i wonder probably 20k or 10 all right well let's go down here what
[15119.93s -> 15135.34s]  what huh i can't walk across that but i could walk across it it looked like a lip i could cross
[15135.34s -> 15169.48s]  hold on i don't buy it i don't actually don't buy it i don't buy it okay what would why would
[15169.48s -> 15176.49s]  this ladder be here if you can't cross that there's no this ladder makes no sense unless
[15176.49s -> 15215.16s]  you keep continuing this way yeah what what did i do wrong now what now what what the hell
[15215.16s -> 15235.50s]  trick disappointing what's the hell what why is this ladder here that ladder doesn't even need
[15235.50s -> 15253.48s]  to be here there's nothing i can do here i drop down i'm gonna just i don't know i don't know i
[15253.48s -> 15285.42s]  think i'm dead if i drop the gap on the other side okay well i went that way last time right
[15285.42s -> 15297.27s]  let's go this way probably in inside the tower is it a room down here that i didn't that i ran
[15297.27s -> 15319.03s]  through or something i ran by okay it is right here i don't go off the fucking edge
[15320.79s -> 15332.94s]  oh fucking how much can you help you both to be copying each other's moves you're not original
[15333.74s -> 15359.48s]  oh so what is this oh shit i can jump around this but wait investigate does not open from this side
[15359.48s -> 15419.40s]  of course it doesn't from here this is such a far way down oh my god okay um now what a golden
[15419.40s -> 15432.50s]  rune i don't have to jump on that right i actually have to land on that thing i've got a jump onto
[15432.50s -> 15445.06s]  that little thing oh that was way off that was way off oh there's a bonfire down here
[15446.02s -> 15452.10s]  it's a bonfire okay at least i know i know there's a bonfire where there's a bonfire
[15452.10s -> 15459.16s]  that is so far by the way do you see how far that is it's gonna take me an hour it's gonna
[15459.16s -> 15469.75s]  take an hour to get down there what the hell i free fell i sky dove down this whole thing
[15472.84s -> 15483.85s]  that was very far they don't fall with me do they yes they do well then they're not gonna make it
[15483.85s -> 15499.38s]  oh my god what do i this way i panicked because he was following me and i forgot which way it was
[15499.38s -> 15505.94s]  here comes the big yeah this is that dumb tree area in dark souls one when we just fall down
[15505.94s -> 15521.54s]  the whole what's it called the route and like it was still only 2k rooms it's fine patience
[15551.43s -> 15586.78s]  it weren't even close oh don't move fuck maybe just a single roll just one singular roll
[15587.50s -> 15612.63s]  just and that's it just a single a single roll what about walk i'm gonna go for the one just
[15612.63s -> 15658.57s]  didn't i was waiting for someone to go right by the screen all right all right it was just walk
[15658.57s -> 15687.56s]  it was just walk oh my god that one was kind of hard and then this one is i don't think i
[15687.56s -> 15735.78s]  can make that one i'm not fucking with this guy i don't care how cheeseball this is
[15735.78s -> 15742.54s]  okay this dude lives on a ledge yeah what what is the point why is that guy here
[15753.83s -> 15773.46s]  it was longer i thought it was a lot i thought it was longer i've been trying i've been walking
[15773.46s -> 15794.14s]  off on all these all right let's freaking go oh shit i forgot i forgot it's uh it's this way
[15794.14s -> 15801.02s]  oh fuck oh fuck how do i get away from these guys god damn it i forgot it's not all the way

[15812.81s -> 15884.41s]  i forgot to kill that guy oh don't he's too stupid to walk over here he died somebody fell off
[15884.41s -> 15928.81s]  there's a lot of items you're not gonna put an item over here from software yes you are why
[15928.81s -> 15934.54s]  wouldn't there be one in the corner right there right there it should be why don't even let me
[15934.54s -> 15939.82s]  go over here unless you're gonna put what a waste of wasting my time absolutely wasting my time

[16100.90s -> 16120.86s]  of course you were hiding an item of course you were and it was disappointing why can i do this
[16120.86s -> 16184.60s]  it doesn't make any sense i want to go up the ladder though i want to go up the ladder i don't
[16184.60s -> 16203.26s]  think i can get that from here i think i'm stuck down here i don't get to swing that many times
[16205.34s -> 16303.72s]  oh somebody got stuttered it's a boss see what it is god skin apostle fuck you i was healing

[16724.15s -> 16738.57s]  this is horrible oh it's so awful like it just looks i hate every second of that
[16739.13s -> 16760.34s]  let me back my fucking dunce comedy outfit wait maybe i'll keep the oh actually that actually
[16760.34s -> 16769.85s]  matches the helmet okay i like the pants they match the head i got a hundred thousand souls
[16769.85s -> 16777.69s]  and i gotta be careful here human skin versus comedy outfit there's a chest in here too
[16778.41s -> 16793.77s]  is this a joke chest why would there be a chest here don't put that in here god slayers great
[16793.77s -> 16809.05s]  sword what sacred sword of the dusk-eyed queen who controlled the godskin apostles
[16809.05s -> 16816.65s]  before her defeat at the hands of maleketh black flames wielded by the apostles are channeled
[16816.65s -> 16823.70s]  from this sword unique skill the queen's black flame set the set the blade ablaze with the
[16823.70s -> 16828.74s]  god-slaying black flame before delivering a sweeping slash additional input allows for a
[16828.74s -> 16838.25s]  follow-up attack black flames will continue to wear down hp for a while what this thing
[16838.25s -> 16849.21s]  is insane looking look at this thing wow that's probably the coolest weapon in the game like in
[16849.21s -> 16867.21s]  regards to how it looks i don't have mana to do it that's so cool looking i can't i don't have
[16867.21s -> 16875.11s]  any mana to do the thing but it still looks awesome this is one of the best weapons in the game you
[16875.11s -> 16881.42s]  should use the flame i imagine it's pretty similar to what these guys are doing to me up here
[16886.34s -> 16891.85s]  okay but that's not that only thing that's down i i like ran away i'll check that out in a minute
[16891.85s -> 16898.50s]  look at how many cool weapons are in this game you know i will say elden ring versus all the other
[16898.50s -> 16906.42s]  souls games there's a lot less at least maybe my brain is remembering this wrong i feel like
[16906.42s -> 16916.42s]  there's a lot of really cool items it's not just like short sword long sword a zweander claymore
[16916.42s -> 16925.69s]  right i feel like there's a ton of these unique weapons a lot more ninety percent of them are
[16925.69s -> 16930.89s]  suck though yeah but i don't think that matters i think it's fun to take decide on a playthrough
[16930.89s -> 16940.60s]  where you're gonna use you know what like i'm i'm using the raduvia in this playthrough i think
[16940.60s -> 16949.03s]  about that's very like actually interesting like the dismounter i'm gonna use this all right so
[16949.03s -> 16954.97s]  that was cool actually i don't i don't want to lose these souls so i gotta be really careful here
[16955.93s -> 16984.23s]  uh we're not gonna do this i can now put the staff on oh i need one more shit i got this thing too
[16984.95s -> 16991.86s]  i gotta go back to the town i got a lot of shit to look through hold on all right all right all
[16991.86s -> 16997.51s]  right all right here's what we're gonna do i'm going back to town i gotta go find it because
[16997.51s -> 17015.88s]  that's a boss soul weapon that is a boss soul weapon the cool int weapon or it's just another
[17015.88s -> 17036.73s]  level which i'll take either one all right what's what is this bastard stars what is this thing
[17038.15s -> 17054.41s]  what is this thing it's a flail it's a magic flail what oh my goodness it's a solar system flail
[17054.41s -> 17089.45s]  ash of war waves of darkness the big d and c scaling it's a flail it's dex int youtube reaction
[17089.45s -> 17097.34s]  for the youtube video look it needs 22 decks as well like this is this is this is an annoying
[17097.34s -> 17103.91s]  weird weapon to get right because you have to put like 10 to 50 you gotta put like at least 10 points
[17103.91s -> 17112.30s]  in decks to have this item and nobody's gonna do that like that's i don't i mean at least not
[17112.30s -> 17139.13s]  too late late game probably right it's expensive and i got it i just want to look at it what the
[17139.21s -> 17154.20s]  hell it's so weird it's actually a solar system i want to see what the i want to see what the power
[17154.20s -> 17163.37s]  does we're just gonna go to like land grave or something it's a baby rattle
[17167.98s -> 17173.74s]  it's a baby rattle all right i need to take the helmet off take the shirt off put a diaper on
[17173.74s -> 17177.90s]  okay does anything look like a diaper in the game because i will use the baby i will be baby character
[17178.46s -> 17216.17s]  okay let's see let's test it out on some sheep that does a lot of damage just like
[17216.73s -> 17228.63s]  in general it's not even leveled up that was 256 damage from the swing and it has not even
[17228.63s -> 17241.48s]  zero plus zero but it's but i have so many cool fucking weapons though that's the problem
[17244.54s -> 17267.19s]  does it have an l2 combo to try and try again l2 l2 i mean you're very vulnerable right here
[17267.19s -> 17280.68s]  because it's like one two three four it's about four full seconds all right it's decision time
[17280.68s -> 17285.40s]  this is a big decision i want all of you this is gonna we're gonna do this democratically
[17286.36s -> 17296.73s]  we're gonna do this we're gonna do this democratically now it's gonna work
[17297.45s -> 17321.62s]  where's the where is it okay are you guys ready we're gonna devote this one out of four items here
[17324.02s -> 17342.87s]  l2 r2 all right baby flail ab flail i want you to get a good look at it i'm gonna see
[17345.91s -> 17351.43s]  no okay people are gonna vote for this because of that people everyone's gonna click on this
[17351.43s -> 17355.19s]  because of what they're looking on the screen right now i need to put a pair of pants on so
[17355.19s -> 17361.77s]  people don't fucking automatically pick this because okay that made it worse that made it
[17361.77s -> 17367.53s]  way worse that made it way worse something that doesn't look like a fucking baby diaper okay
[17370.68s -> 17377.16s]  okay here we go baby rattle cool animation it's got the big explosion thing
[17377.96s -> 17386.38s]  it's pretty cool it's pretty sick pretty cool weapon i let's take a look at that again
[17387.34s -> 17398.44s]  without bang boom pretty cool we also have bug arm bug leaf so this thing is is like a scimitar
[17398.44s -> 17406.57s]  got a pretty good swing also has does not take intelligence to do this it has a big
[17407.21s -> 17416.94s]  intelligence scaling magic weapon also it's got its own version of the baby rattle although this
[17416.94s -> 17422.47s]  one is better i that happens faster it might not do as much damage we're not sure
[17424.65s -> 17440.09s]  bug wing that does not take intelligence pretty sick we also have moon veil now if you don't know
[17440.09s -> 17444.25s]  what moon veil is moon veil is the thing that has been uh carrying us through the entire mid game
[17445.72s -> 17452.50s]  i'll go we'll call this styrofoam sword if you want to get a good look it's styrofoam so styrofoam
[17452.50s -> 17460.74s]  sword boom take a look at this wham those thousand damage whoosh big intelligence move
[17460.74s -> 17466.10s]  unbelievably beautiful everyone's not going to vote for this because the katana and all katanas
[17466.10s -> 17473.14s]  are shitty loser weapons in these games from what i've been told so but it's incredible finally
[17474.34s -> 17477.21s]  we've got this
[17483.69s -> 17493.51s]  finally we've got the moonlit greatsword staple in from software and a weapon that is
[17493.51s -> 17499.85s]  in every single one of these games it can turn into a big bright night light which then has this
[17499.85s -> 17505.29s]  awesome beauty it's frost damage shoots out these cool projectiles also does not take
[17505.29s -> 17527.29s]  mana to do that very cool so what do we have ab rattle uh styrofoam katana bug wing moonlit
[17527.29s -> 17543.74s]  sword oh you want to see the other one yeah let me show you that one too somebody fucking weapons
[17544.38s -> 17551.75s]  there's so many weapons where is it right all right what is current i can't even look yet
[17552.55s -> 17567.30s]  i don't think i have enough ability to i can't turn it on the game won't let me turn the
[17567.30s -> 17579.66s]  cool thing on all right is it baby rattle or bug wing okay baby rattle is currently winning
[17579.66s -> 17589.18s]  bug wing is really close i can't even activate the power because i'm not
[17589.18s -> 17601.58s]  cool enough unfortunately you're gonna have to do a redo all right baby rattle one i'm thinking
[17602.22s -> 17630.87s]  this weapon better be fucking good the baby i don't think i actually i don't know if i want
[17630.87s -> 17639.02s]  to play as the baby should i not play as baby okay we're gonna do a vote between baby rattle
[17639.02s -> 17644.76s]  and bug wing because those are the two that ones and now everybody gets a choice baby rattle and
[17644.76s -> 17655.82s]  bug wing are now you get the real choice of real choices here pretty damn cool but what about this
[17655.82s -> 17666.47s]  one have you seen this one have you taken a look at what this one can do it's sick really cool
[17668.57s -> 17685.11s]  every time i take it up what about dual wielding them i need a staff in my other hand okay baby
[17685.11s -> 17701.03s]  rattle let's go all right this is gonna be close this is gonna be close i need something in my off
[17701.03s -> 17716.97s]  hand i need i need something small like a little like baby rattle it's like a little frisbee
[17718.73s -> 17727.42s]  okay baby oh what about the bug wing it's a pacifier
[17739.34s -> 17752.20s]  i have to get out of the frame but have you seen but have you seen buckling
[17793.98s -> 17812.38s]  redesign your character to look like a baby okay i'll be honest people are like saying oh no he's
[17812.38s -> 17817.10s]  doing a meme now and he was doing so well this apparently is one of the best intelligence weapons
[17817.10s -> 17836.65s]  in the game so how do i not have a regular somber smithing stone doesn't seem impossible
[17844.18s -> 17852.62s]  all right i know what i'm doing but i can't do it yet i can almost put this on which is going to be
[17852.62s -> 17876.71s]  a huge deal i can go back to actually casting sorceries again this is these better kind of
[17876.71s -> 17890.87s]  are yeah they just are i know boo boo boo i know it's no i'm not ready yet we're not ready yet
[17891.59s -> 17912.90s]  i need a regular somber smithing stone i'm using this thing neumann's rune 12 000 runes holy shit
[17925.21s -> 17937.67s]  this blacksmith sells those stones does he can't buy them the fat guy on the bridge has a literal
[17937.67s -> 17959.74s]  diaper are you being serious plus eight mimic by the way oleg's next there's gonna be two babies
[17959.74s -> 17973.35s]  running around the giant blacksmith all right where's the giant blacksmith he's over here
[17973.35s -> 17982.41s]  somewhere right he's like this way isn't he he's like don't go over to the manor you'd be foolish
[17992.74s -> 18011.21s]  all right what do you got name the teething ring and become the baby lord it would not have been
[18011.21s -> 18022.82s]  impossible without as lady rani's war counselor a childhood why express my deepest gratitude
[18031.35s -> 18067.99s]  talk or talk no talk or talk d scaling coming up we need a somber smithing stone four got them
[18067.99s -> 18079.08s]  what is that what is this what lowers fp consumed by skills i didn't see that the skill technically
[18079.96s -> 18089.51s]  okay i need 6000 souls shouldn't have upgraded that fucking all right let's just go get some souls
[18090.23s -> 18098.39s]  uh was the quickest place for me to get souls right now
[18100.82s -> 18106.55s]  i could go i could go fight the baby diaper lady where was that it was like here somewhere right
[18106.55s -> 18134.07s]  yeah oh get the diaper i'll try i will honest to god try uh not here wrong bridge where was it
[18134.55s -> 18147.06s]  well this is the right bridge right oh it's not this one isn't it i think it's this one
[18157.11s -> 18165.03s]  oh lady ron all right let's do it i'm a lot more leveled up now this should be a pretty
[18165.67s -> 18174.76s]  decent encounter it shouldn't be too hard the bug is way cooler it's too bad chat voted
[18175.32s -> 18180.98s]  thing is there's enough materials i could use in both let's kill but i'm gonna lean into this
[18180.98s -> 18224.12s]  for just a few moments let's go it's going way better it still hurts stop rolling
[18244.57s -> 18292.22s]  wow even with the bubble on that fucking hurt what the fuck Jesus man fuck off with this nonsense
[18324.36s -> 18343.61s]  swing no fucking stamina remaining in my inventory old skin noblehood noble robe
[18344.33s -> 18359.66s]  noble bracelets noble trousers what there's more of this shit hostile noble
[18369.58s -> 18416.20s]  no it has a bib let me look at this because i it actually the defense is really not that bad
[18419.59s -> 18431.72s]  defense is okay actually i'm not against it it's like baby birth it's like birthday boy
[18432.44s -> 18449.56s]  it's my birthday okay i need pants though dude i can't just run around like a fucking idiot
[18455.42s -> 18479.03s]  no no pants we're on the commoners trousers you can well you can see my ass wait you can see
[18479.03s -> 18494.44s]  that much he's naked you can see so much what the fuck that's fucking ridiculous why
[18495.40s -> 18505.64s]  but hold on what does that actually look like i feel like there's less when i have this on
[18514.15s -> 18523.70s]  is it like is it is it like he's an ass no i'm not ass inspecting i'm not i'm just i that was
[18523.70s -> 18564.41s]  weird to see okay i'm going back to the blacksmith where the fuck am i where is he i thought he was
[18564.41s -> 18583.85s]  a rock i don't think i have enough to level up doing all right this actually i'm not even
[18583.85s -> 18591.77s]  kidding around is probably gonna end up doing a ton of damage i need another thousand souls
[18592.33s -> 18622.18s]  we're gonna get a thousand so we're gonna get like 5 000 souls quick like very quick dogs down here
[18622.18s -> 18631.40s]  i guess i could just go but no they're only giving like 200 they sell some weapons and armor people
[18631.40s -> 18635.64s]  got mad at me when i did that last time i'm just gonna go to where i kind of like this area here
[18635.64s -> 18644.84s]  there's a bunch of random shit i can kill so did i is that it for caleb i don't think i did this
[18645.56s -> 18663.77s]  yeah let me let me investigate some of this stuff here because there was this thing here where is
[18663.77s -> 18671.99s]  this because this is like along this road all right i'm gonna go here i'll go do that dungeon
[18672.55s -> 18682.06s]  this is not upgraded all the way and this is not final but i'm curious how much damage this does
[18682.06s -> 18697.24s]  at like a plus four or plus five i mean for having a bunch of enemies you get surrounded by enemies
[18697.24s -> 18722.81s]  that's like a absolute oh shit button let's try it to be interrupted it's doing a decent amount
[18723.69s -> 18746.82s]  once it's leveled up it'll be better staggers it's really pretty it sucks stop it does
[18748.73s -> 18751.77s]  i wasted no i didn't i'm gonna i'm gonna wait until i level up a little more
[18752.65s -> 18783.35s]  it's not even leveled up wait till it's leveled up another super time look at that it staggers big
[18783.35s -> 18828.41s]  time the baby sucks it's not fair to it's not fair to talk about it yet i have no i'm not giving up
[18828.41s -> 18839.96s]  on it yet it seems like it's but it's this we're going up this is not leveled for the enemies i'm
[18839.96s -> 18854.07s]  fighting that's stupid i don't care instant kill moves are dumb instant kill moves are dumb
[18857.02s -> 18887.94s]  let me say it again instant kill moves are stupid all right you're not fully armored i know ratio
[18887.94s -> 18916.17s]  don't ratio me actually is getting a lot better 157 plus 148 it's starting to get actually pretty
[18916.17s -> 18945.91s]  good what's the katana right now katana is plus eight it's 187 plus 148 one seven plus one 168
[18945.91s -> 18965.56s]  plus 166 katana is so much better by by like an insane order of magnitude you want to try it with
[18965.56s -> 18975.38s]  the boss and give up after 30 minutes and rant about how much it sucks for 30 minutes yeah no
[18975.94s -> 18980.74s]  what the hell did you hear my voice yeah what was that fucking weird thing that i just did
[18996.30s -> 19025.40s]  all right let me take a look 157 plus 148 187 plus 148 is plus seven this is plus eight
[19037.27s -> 19043.59s]  i'll try it for a while i do need uh some more souls to get it to the same place
[19045.19s -> 19053.06s]  okay so i i how many plus nine smithing stones do i have i only have one plus nine smithing stone
[19053.06s -> 19064.20s]  right now and i am absolutely not going to use it on the baby rattle and until stars have
[19064.20s -> 19080.14s]  higher int scaling all right because i can get this i am willing to get this to plus eight
[19080.94s -> 19087.74s]  and try it but i need i need some more souls i'm gonna sell a couple of things that's
[19087.74s -> 19098.41s]  something easy i can't let's talk talk you get so many somber stones yeah i know
[19100.84s -> 19101.72s]  wait blight
[19128.01s -> 19128.97s]  hey what about blade

[19144.17s -> 19159.43s]  i already did that man i need 1575 so let me just go get like a thousand souls like in two seconds
[19162.84s -> 19177.58s]  if you kill one boss with a baby weapon then it deserves a plus nine why did i come here this is
[19177.58s -> 19219.67s]  my least favorite area in the whole game i've been able to swing why did i come here this place sucks
[19220.15s -> 19236.95s]  why would i why did i come to this area no it's not the weapon the baby rattle is it's gonna be
[19236.95s -> 19253.06s]  sick trust me it's gonna work out it's gonna work out it's gonna be good just out of spite i need

[19375.67s -> 19385.46s]  plus 166 that's in that's in this becomes c scaling here by the way xc int b this is doing
[19385.46s -> 19392.12s]  a lot of damage now i'm not willing to do plus nine on this i don't know what i want to do plus
[19392.12s -> 19402.58s]  nine now we're gonna actually play the game i've got some good shit i'm ready i'm all geared up
[19403.22s -> 19414.84s]  i'm ready i wanted to go check out this down here how do i get here let's start from here
[19416.09s -> 19431.54s]  no wrong this is wrong right yes this is wrong
[19444.82s -> 19452.34s]  so where is this dungeon i'm assuming probably on the road and go down from the road maybe
[19453.14s -> 19464.06s]  if i were to go get this way maybe i don't know what boss has been the scariest so far um
[19465.02s -> 19473.78s]  scary as in design or scary as in god i don't want to do that fight ever again which one yes
[19473.78s -> 19485.80s]  i need to go up here oh uh well i never want to do that fight ever again it's probably done
[19486.44s -> 19492.58s]  i just found that fight to be just a monster gimmick that it was just like a frustrating
[19492.58s -> 19500.12s]  gimmick fight that i hated i'd say that one if you're talking about like scary and creepy
[19500.92s -> 19505.96s]  and just designed really really it probably the big uh the thing where i got the baby rattle from
[19506.76s -> 19525.86s]  big astral like centipede bug praying mantis thing yeah the nerds were up astral yeah the nerds
[19525.86s -> 19531.29s]  were up possible that was just crazy looking had the whole solar system on its tail it was really
[19531.29s -> 19553.27s]  cool all right so now the idea is can i go where's this road that's not a road it's not a road what
[19553.27s -> 19570.44s]  is it so where's the dungeon down to the boss area so what do i have to go up this way from
[19570.44s -> 19587.29s]  the boss area because i can't get down there from here yes so interesting okay so it's this way
[19589.48s -> 19596.54s]  let's go big baby we're gonna go find it we're gonna go prove to everybody that this was not
[19596.54s -> 19627.75s]  a stupid idea to waste a bunch of somber smithing stones it's the painting it is the painting
[19628.39s -> 19669.43s]  is it is this just a painting dungeon so the painter so that's up though that's right there
[19670.15s -> 19700.17s]  is that up on a cliff but it kind of looks like it's right here maybe a little bit higher
[19718.54s -> 19727.26s]  it's like up there where am i right now yeah it's right here okay i'm gonna mark this like with an
[19727.26s -> 19763.19s]  actual marker called um yeah it's definitely right there dude much further down it is this
[19763.19s -> 19794.78s]  dungeon holy shit there it is look like such a fucking jackass i want the ones that match
[19795.74s -> 19823.08s]  that's right the ones that matched i think it was these ones yeah this matches war dead catacombs
[19823.08s -> 19886.97s]  let's try it this is very hard well great opportunity to try the baby rattle who just
[19886.97s -> 19954.94s]  hit me that you standing here like an idiot where'd he go where's the big guy i mean i'm
[19954.94s -> 19965.48s]  gonna die from the rot so what's the point just run around for a minute well there you are just
[19965.48s -> 19993.40s]  right there bro oh come on collapsing stars i got it i'll be able to put some of these new
[19993.40s -> 20007.66s]  insane sorcery moves on soon i got at least three or four that uh i need at least 50 which i'm
[20007.66s -> 20014.09s]  getting there i'm i think i need one more point intelligence i need one more point in intelligence
[20014.09s -> 20032.44s]  and we can get started with that sorcery shit okay don't think it's even worth fighting a lot
[20032.44s -> 20041.26s]  of these guys i got the chest there's probably something else down here maybe another time
[20054.10s -> 20065.94s]  oh grave bluff war if they're just gonna fight each other then they're just gonna fight each
[20065.94s -> 20085.30s]  other so who cares huh you shot me through a wall i didn't know the timing's on it but i
[20085.30s -> 20102.70s]  could hit through a wall hit me through a wall it was dumb oh it wasn't for yes it was nobody
[20102.70s -> 20112.09s]  argues with the giant baby i'm playing the perfect i'm playing the perfect streamer character this is
[20112.09s -> 20233.91s]  my punishment be like the big whiny baby character baby rage i can go that way but not yet holy shit
[20233.91s -> 20273.26s]  got a lot of help damn man get out of my way 155 damage omega lull it's not bad i just need
[20273.26s -> 20314.30s]  it needs a little getting used to okay you're getting used to sucking oh good thing i fucking
[20314.30s -> 20335.88s]  dodged that accidentally holy shit they should be able to get hit more than once with that
[20337.69s -> 20341.69s]  baby rattle would be a lot better if i if they could get hit by more than one of those
[20343.85s -> 20350.90s]  that would be actually awesome instead it gives them invulnerability you know the dead word
[20351.62s -> 20399.61s]  you got a spear i hate spears holy shit he's got a teleporter i thought i had time he's
[20420.54s -> 20452.95s]  punk actual punk can we get out of the fucking corridor get out of the corridor
[20468.07s -> 20519.56s]  oh fuck baby needs his i'm not gonna say that out loud it was just what there was just fucking
[20519.56s -> 20528.42s]  flowers in here that's why i fought all the way through that flowers i did that for a flower
[20528.42s -> 20574.49s]  those live those are alive hey oh through the window yep thanks yeah right through the window
[20575.82s -> 20595.98s]  oh shit i have no mana left i'm gonna pull them i'm down here fighting over here coward
[20596.70s -> 20601.18s]  coward come over here coward oh come over here coward come on that guy flipped me off
[20614.52s -> 20647.54s]  hey never leave your post somebody else can fucking deal with you man
[20651.02s -> 20654.70s]  oh don't forget about the glove ward of course that's why i came all the way down here
[20655.34s -> 20692.73s]  did i do everything there's probably a boss down here did i i feel like i didn't see everything
[20692.73s -> 20714.76s]  all right back to it so wait which way did i not go oh straight through i didn't go straight
[20714.76s -> 20751.03s]  through here walked by a contraption oh great fuck this game walk by a contraption
[20756.90s -> 20799.00s]  and they take so long it's like one two three then he lets go this game i'm not dodging i don't care
[20813.75s -> 20821.56s]  okay what the heck's happening here i see stuff does it matter what do i need to do
[20822.58s -> 20826.26s]  holy shit i didn't know he was fucking i thought he was shooting the bow and arrow
[20826.26s -> 20863.37s]  what why did he come over here what the fuck i hate you i don't know um oh we're going this way
[20868.50s -> 20902.02s]  uh i had that backstab i don't want to fight him anyways fucking don't care i don't want to fight
[20902.02s -> 20958.65s]  that guy so i don't care there it is no i'm farming for souls that i want to die at the boss the boss
[20958.65s -> 20986.30s]  are gonna be hard yeah well it's open but there's no boss bog hey there is okay all right this is
[20986.30s -> 21002.81s]  gonna be fun ah this is gonna be fun i'm just trying to throw a tantrum i mean it does a lot
[21002.81s -> 21024.86s]  of damage it just takes a long time to happen and it's cool when it hits it's really cool
[21030.89s -> 21052.25s]  i mean it's awesome it's really cool the move is amazing when it hits five that does like 900
[21052.25s -> 21070.30s]  damage if it actually lands 550 i mean it's good i mean look at that 600 that's a 1200 damage if it
[21070.30s -> 21102.12s]  hits i think i have enough was it 40 000 42 000 kill one more if it hits yes that's free
[21103.16s -> 21125.22s]  not fighting that guy try the katana again um i mean i love the katana 42 of course it is
[21125.30s -> 21135.46s]  i just walked off the weapon this weapons driving me insane why is this weapon why is it driving
[21135.46s -> 21184.39s]  you insane it's a cool weapon it's bad yeah it doesn't mean you can't have fun with a bad weapon
[21184.95s -> 21208.73s]  it's not even a bad weapon it's really not just got bad range yeah you know why the katana really
[21208.73s -> 21212.89s]  is better and why the katana is like one of the best weapons in the whole game because it has
[21212.89s -> 21223.88s]  bleed all right we just unlocked a very important milestone i have 52 intelligence which means
[21224.60s -> 21250.15s]  boys and girls got it you can actually use this thing actually use it look at the speed look at
[21250.15s -> 21261.99s]  the speed how much is the lung that does happen way faster if you don't know why i've been putting
[21261.99s -> 21271.53s]  points into intelligence not just for the scaling also because this thing makes all of my sorceries
[21272.49s -> 21278.49s]  cast speed way higher and new spells too that's right but we will play with those very shortly
[21279.21s -> 21284.20s]  what i want to do right now is just go get my ass kicked from a boss that's in this room
[21287.10s -> 21290.14s]  i don't care i'm not trying to i'm just trying to see what the boss's
[21290.14s -> 21297.42s]  moves are i don't really give a shit about beating it first time it's going to be really fun when i
[21297.42s -> 21304.78s]  start actively actively complaining about how bad this weapon is after losing to the first what
[21304.78s -> 21309.78s]  boss is going to do two moves and hurt me and kill me uh putrid tree it's another one of these
[21311.22s -> 21441.13s]  still hit me fuck wrong bus shit it's a little longer fuck wasn't bad okay wasn't bad it actually
[21441.13s -> 21456.31s]  did some pretty decent damage we're gonna do a test see let's see how this is the bit is over
[21456.31s -> 21473.22s]  go back to the real weapon i think it's actually doable because that was doing about 1200 damage
[21473.78s -> 21488.74s]  it just takes a long time let's see how much this does in comparison i know it's not even
[21488.74s -> 21561.94s]  fucking like that's not even a contest happens so much faster that and the stagger and grady
[21562.74s -> 21643.70s]  things fucking this weapon's unbelievable goodbye first try with the fucking katana
[21644.90s -> 21660.97s]  fucking fuck the katana is insane the katana is insane katana is staggering like a two-handed
[21660.97s -> 21678.60s]  hammer damn i think we're just spoiled by how good the katana really is and that's a new name
[21678.60s -> 21688.57s]  spirit too all right so here's the play here here's your here's your play i i want to play
[21688.57s -> 21692.65s]  with the baby rattle i'm very actually do want to play with it i don't think we gave it enough
[21692.65s -> 21705.16s]  chance by the way it's time to upgrade sorcery shit i got a flask upgrade i want to go back to
[21705.16s -> 21722.68s]  using sorcery so this is how we do it i got a bunch of new sorceries i can do and look if a
[21722.68s -> 21727.08s]  boss is giving me too much trouble then whip out the fucking katana and just let his head off
[21734.74s -> 21747.67s]  okay so i got a lot of souls it's time to leave i got a bunch of uh ashes too right there's a
[21747.67s -> 21759.43s]  casting speed talisman wow where is this right here a lid this edge here i mean that boss was
[21759.43s -> 21767.03s]  like kind of all right the reason why so that boss remember the first time i fought that boss
[21767.67s -> 21775.26s]  it was like 10 levels under level for it we've seen that same snake lizard monster enemy like
[21775.26s -> 21781.38s]  three times now so i kind of already knew the move set so i was pretty prepared for that
[21783.80s -> 21787.16s]  say that it was the same exact move set the only difference was it was
[21787.16s -> 21808.82s]  rot instead of lightning so there's a there's quite a few of those let's level up all right
[21808.82s -> 21814.31s]  uh it's time to examine some spells that i can now use this is a shit load now that i want to try
[21814.95s -> 21819.91s]  especially with this new incredibly better scaled and i'm going to go upgrade it again so here we go
[21821.83s -> 21831.00s]  first slot swift glint stone is is good it's good just kind of like oh i got comet now
[21831.96s -> 21858.20s]  that takes a whole fucking mana bar that takes so much mana i wonder how much damage that actually
[21858.20s -> 21866.92s]  does all right but anyways i think swift glint stone shard is good for just agro it's good for
[21867.48s -> 21882.87s]  chip damage i'll do comet after that and where are the other ones okay there's eternal darkness
[21885.61s -> 21890.76s]  forbidden sorcery creates a space of darkness that draws in sorceries and incantations the
[21890.76s -> 21899.14s]  sorcery can be cast while in motion okay i got another one too where is it there it is night
[21899.14s -> 21910.65s]  comet fires a semi-invisible magic comet the sorcerer can recast repeatedly okay collapsing
[21910.65s -> 21923.32s]  stars was another one and then what else magic downpour no crystal release crystal release
[21923.88s -> 21958.78s]  okay let's check these out right that's awful i can't move during this that's you have to
[21958.78s -> 21969.85s]  stand completely still okay what about i gotta know eternal darkness whoa what does this do
[21969.85s -> 21983.08s]  you only have one active wait this sucks up sorceries so i could literally just sit here and
[21983.08s -> 21995.22s]  cast okay that's actually good to have on the bar night comet what's the difference between that
[21995.22s -> 22016.38s]  and regular comet that looks good i like the way that one looks stealthier i don't have seeds
[22017.34s -> 22030.07s]  it absorbs spells it's harder to see in pvp this thing actually looks pretty insane
[22030.07s -> 22036.65s]  i wonder how much damage that does we get it tested on somebody that one looks good
[22041.82s -> 22046.62s]  omit with plus 60 with 60 plus intelligence and you never would have to melee anything again
[22047.42s -> 22057.45s]  yeah but the problem with that is i need way more mana it's tested on this person never you
[22057.45s -> 22065.22s]  i don't know if that was me hurting them or if he fell and he literally did that little damage
[22066.66s -> 22091.42s]  well that's fucking dog shit did i just stagger him though upgraded this is more than the other
[22091.42s -> 22110.55s]  one is hold on it's probably this enemy type yeah run on some normal guys yeah it's really
[22110.55s -> 22115.74s]  cheap to cast i want to see how much comet does not on these guys because these guys are obviously
[22115.74s -> 22131.70s]  beefy bulky bozos but i'm still gonna do it that's in actually insane for how much
[22132.50s -> 22149.10s]  you know what i mean 466 damage these guys are insanely resistant that's big all right
[22151.06s -> 22157.37s]  oh what else do i got this thing's cool this is cool but i don't think i want it
[22157.93s -> 22166.49s]  i think i keep on loretta's great bow it's been tried and true this thing is stupid so it's coming
[22166.49s -> 22177.54s]  off we're still barrage i remember this this thing was we laughed at this we made fun of this
[22178.26s -> 22201.27s]  i wonder if this is better with more scaling all right i need to go upgrade big time and i have to
[22201.27s -> 22206.76s]  go check out the dragon stuff too time is it how long have i been streaming for
[22219.86s -> 22227.67s]  what am i missing i probably need some more yeah i need smithing stone five for this i don't think
[22227.67s -> 22235.85s]  the giant sells five i have to go get them find them somewhere this goes to s scaling after this
[22236.65s -> 22250.30s]  i mean that's a huge fucking deal s scaling uh i'm gonna pee i'll be back we'll figure this out
[22250.94s -> 22579.48s]  drb three minutes i'm gonna get some water okay how are you how you doing good you're going
[22581.35s -> 22594.26s]  uh i need to figure out where to get somber smithing stone five i didn't have any music shit
[22594.26s -> 22616.84s]  oops did you beat the big boss in the desert are you talking about radan because i did it was
[22616.84s -> 22642.95s]  horrible all right let's come back now i think we're gonna have to i think we're gonna have to
[22643.83s -> 22664.34s]  i don't know i need smithing stones i could also probably do with another sacred tier or two
[22667.80s -> 22672.79s]  and another flask and that seems that's all right but
[22672.79s -> 22679.98s]  i have no more love warts
[22687.99s -> 22698.94s]  so what are we doing i got the coin to where where is that grand lift that's what i want to do now
[22699.50s -> 22710.28s]  no i don't i want to see what this is we're gonna do that north leonia i want to see what that does
[22710.28s -> 22726.97s]  spend all the time getting it first of all we're going that way that swamp outside uh cilia yep
[22727.69s -> 22748.84s]  let me do this first though this thing's really world shaking yeah in there oh but that's a
[22748.84s -> 22758.31s]  gigantic pot that pot's in fact as big as a building so you guys must be thrilled right now
[22758.95s -> 22808.39s]  sky shot uh i gotta go around haven't been here excuse me i gotta go all the way around dude
[22808.39s -> 22816.10s]  come on really this is gonna kill me isn't it oh come on look at all that's not that far
[22838.79s -> 22848.98s]  where's the fastest fucking way to get over there i don't from here that was so far no it's not
[22848.98s -> 22865.98s]  it's not that far it's not it's not far i don't want to hear it what if you fell from that far
[22865.98s -> 22873.53s]  i'm not a magical baby okay if i was a magical baby i don't think i would die if i fell from
[22873.53s -> 22907.03s]  that far no i'm not sorry contrary to popular belief i'm not a magical baby now we go this way
[22910.73s -> 22918.10s]  and from here i have to keep this in mind because i gotta go around but where's a safe place i can
[22918.10s -> 22934.73s]  go around that way no it's the best way to get over there from here it's a magical baby
[22935.61s -> 22953.05s]  it would have been bad all right i see a dungeon down there and i want to go look at it
[22953.05s -> 22969.45s]  oh i'm gonna take more machine things this is just a boss uh no no i want a bonfire what happened
[22969.45s -> 22987.19s]  here i want a bonfire what the fuck why am i like a rodent get what the hold on
[23003.10s -> 23037.74s]  all right oh my god press the right button for once in your life 700 fucking damage
[23039.90s -> 23052.90s]  that was crazy all right comet is good very good comet is very very good i need a bonfire here
[23053.46s -> 23085.69s]  there's got to be one right here somewhere there's one that one anything looks good compared to
[23085.69s -> 23091.43s]  crystal barrage i mean i think comet really is just a fantastic move though always has been
[23093.88s -> 23100.44s]  i want to go in that dungeon but probably you need to level up one more time but see if i can do it
[23100.44s -> 23138.52s]  but we'll explore a little bit let's check and see i do want to buy i do want to level up one more
[23138.52s -> 23181.91s]  time what the fuck what was that oh it's these guys shut up all right it's time for the baby
[23181.91s -> 23208.02s]  rattles to really show us why i got it in the first place that's it for here that's sick yeah
[23208.02s -> 23221.00s]  no it is that's some sick shit you're right it's very cool it's a really good ambush weapon
[23226.34s -> 23257.32s]  oh look what the internet taught me 31 000 damage the guide told him that no i saw i saw a gif
[23258.04s -> 23266.04s]  i've been avoiding everything elden ring but i saw this gift i was like that was fucking cool
[23266.60s -> 23277.13s]  that was a pretty sick gift it wasn't a gif in the guide there's no guide it's fun to do that
[23277.13s -> 23289.08s]  though all right it's cool to do this you all know it like that spin and i think that pretty
[23289.08s -> 23301.88s]  much wraps it up although i need myself i'll go down and it's probably something cool down there
[23310.36s -> 23328.68s]  oh there's so many of them i'm only getting 25 souls for each one of these idiots it's not
[23328.68s -> 23346.30s]  even worth doing that was that was like 30 people that i just killed all right i need to find a
[23346.30s -> 23361.54s]  little space to level up dungeon here uh was it just a boss though it looked like just a boss door
[23362.82s -> 23368.39s]  or am i stupid and misremembering the thing that i just looked at it looked like a boss door
[23380.04s -> 23384.38s]  not a hard boss so what you're saying is i should just get in here and kill this thing
[23384.38s -> 23388.94s]  and this shouldn't be a big problem and i i it's a probably pretty easy boss
[23389.82s -> 23397.38s]  all right so i gotta prove myself here then what are you saying i got 35 000 uh souls on the line
[23398.34s -> 23402.34s]  and i gotta prove that i don't i'm not just like a katana
[23403.14s -> 23410.95s]  roch andy is what you're saying okay i get it i could i could see how you could be you could
[23410.95s -> 23424.73s]  think that yeah i could see that i could understand that uh criticism all right fine
[23425.29s -> 23480.70s]  i'll go do it right now okay i'll go do it right now let's go what an opener oh that was like the
[23480.70s -> 23489.11s]  fight to you this is like the baby rattle fight that was actually the baby rattle fight there's
[23489.43s -> 23517.26s]  that was like the item to bring here oh my god some bronze shield depicting the face of a fire
[23517.26s -> 23535.22s]  giant several tongues leap from its open mouth tongues of fire really holy shit this thing is
[23535.22s -> 23565.75s]  big this thing is irritatingly large it's a dud this thing's a dud i'm too weak oh that's a crazy
[23565.75s -> 23586.73s]  item that's what i use that's the best parry shield in the game yeah and i two-handed try
[23586.73s -> 23607.67s]  it still doesn't work imagine how shit you could have a place root b if i mean like i know it's
[23607.67s -> 23625.48s]  like funny and shit but wow how unbearable would this be that i can't use it i know people do it
[23625.48s -> 23632.15s]  though people do shield they upgrade the fuck out of the shield and i mean it doesn't i mean that's
[23632.23s -> 23642.46s]  bad but it probably scales okay see the people running around with two shields
[23643.67s -> 23659.90s]  like this i remember this strat people used to do this shit he's like okay buddy you having a good
[23659.90s -> 23672.49s]  time it looks like i'm trying to make myself a makeshift 1910 flying machine that's what this
[23672.49s -> 23681.91s]  looks like i've got like the big puffy airbag i've got aerodynamic head i've got weird shit on my
[23681.91s -> 23687.59s]  back like a sail and wings this is this is the 1910 we have to get somebody in a personal flying
[23687.59s -> 23707.98s]  machine okay that's very cool that was cool all right now i just need to level up a little bit
[23707.98s -> 23728.33s]  let's get the comet out what do you say the 1910 cotton candy build it's got splash damage on it
[23728.33s -> 23761.46s]  too it's crazy what is that thing get it away from me rattle can't be good i can't believe it
[23761.46s -> 23771.10s]  is fucked well you better believe it because it's not it's actually not a bad item all right
[23771.10s -> 23777.02s]  what was the goal the goal was to get to this building up here right i'm i gotta i gotta focus
[23777.02s -> 23790.15s]  i have to level up but still i gotta focus on what the hell i was doing are you oh my god oh my god
[23790.15s -> 23797.90s]  oh my god i'm dead i saw that come from a mile away and i didn't do anything about it i just
[23798.46s -> 23805.93s]  i stood there i was just sitting there looking at him in my mind it was there's no way he's
[23805.93s -> 23813.30s]  gonna come this far there's no way he's gonna come all the way over here he just kept his head down
[23814.42s -> 23838.74s]  like this and just dragged it on the ground across what seemed to be the entire game that makes such
[23838.74s -> 23846.58s]  a funny sound all right stop fucking around and just leave i don't even need to be he just hit
[23846.58s -> 23902.02s]  his friend do i have enough to level up yet i'm sick of you why is it fire everywhere who's shooting
[23902.02s -> 23912.68s]  the fire dude you can double it up did you see that so you can go charge it wham wham and that's
[23912.68s -> 23920.49s]  13 1400 damage at least it's actually insane okay cool i need more intelligence and i need to get
[23920.49s -> 23930.28s]  this thing leveled up so it scales better it it looked like scrappy do in the scooby-doo movie
[23930.28s -> 23936.09s]  where they get all fucked up from the souls i don't know that's very specific i don't think i know
[23936.09s -> 23965.42s]  what you mean i don't know what that means okay one with mr bean you know what we're doing we're
[23965.42s -> 23972.52s]  doing sorcery again doing intelligence again i'm getting this shit to 50 intelligence before i do
[23972.52s -> 23983.37s]  anything else all right now the plan was i was gonna go there so that's what i'm gonna do
[23984.25s -> 23991.32s]  i need mind all right the next time i get like two or three points it's a lot of it's going into
[23991.32s -> 24022.74s]  mine there's really another one right here mine gets better as you level it up i think basically
[24022.74s -> 24035.40s]  the opposite of all the other stats really there is one of these trees over here too
[24036.28s -> 24087.45s]  usually aren't they usually like a weird tree boss well shut up get stop it just get out of here
[24092.66s -> 24112.84s]  i was doing something great sword just a regular great sword yeah i mean they it's got it got it
[24112.84s -> 24124.04s]  has to be in the game right so i have a question for all of you souls fanatics is there a reason
[24124.94s -> 24132.55s]  to use a great sword like that when all these other wacky fucking items in the game exist
[24133.35s -> 24155.82s]  horse iron lip of ultra great sword oh this is the gut sword yeah because i mean like but if you
[24157.02s -> 24164.07s]  i mean it's cool but if i feel like there's somebody there's tons of interesting weapons
[24166.23s -> 24172.98s]  it's almost hard to justify using just a regular weapon like for instance is any is anybody just
[24172.98s -> 24184.89s]  using a long sword just like this like who who's using like the dagger i'm just yeah i'm using
[24184.89s -> 24192.15s]  the just dagger it's the regular dagger so many cool things it's hard to justify you and they're
[24192.15s -> 24198.23s]  probably fine they probably scaled really well it's like holy shit the scorpion stinger the
[24198.23s -> 24207.32s]  redo via the mr record day like there's so much cool shit oh i'm gonna use the stock are you
[24208.36s -> 24217.32s]  because like there's so much other crazy shit in the game you can swap out blade arts on normal
[24217.32s -> 24225.86s]  weapons okay so that's a big deal that's a big deal that justifies a lot of reasons to use it
[24225.86s -> 24230.92s]  because you can put whatever you want on it okay all right that makes sense that's okay i get it
[24235.75s -> 24241.43s]  blade art plus infusion that's true yep okay yep you're right i stand completely corrected
[24241.43s -> 24254.36s]  you're right but there's gonna be one of those bosses here right isn't there always one of those
[24254.36s -> 24292.33s]  weird uh tree uh like death root or something i think there is yeah go find out hmm of a dungeon
[24293.21s -> 24307.50s]  point me into the direction of the dungeon there's a dungeon down i gotta go down that way anyways so
[24307.50s -> 24349.26s]  let's go and that's how you get down there is that a church is that an npc all right let's go
[24354.44s -> 24366.14s]  that is a church all right i'll get a tear from this this place looks so weird
[24369.30s -> 24385.02s]  it's moldering church there's cookbook another cookbook there's no sacred tear here usually
[24385.02s -> 24416.81s]  there's a tear right where's the tear no tear what kind of church is this what kind of church is
[24417.53s -> 24444.73s]  there's no tear didn't i already look at this the the guts right invaded by anesthesia tarnished
[24444.73s -> 24481.96s]  eater where are they oh would you look at you oh that hurts you a lot doesn't it easy sacred
[24481.96s -> 24491.82s]  scorpion charm godfrey at last at the end of his campaign his golden armies unvanquished and
[24491.82s -> 24506.79s]  unbowed it finds grace lost tattered and faded talisman raises holy attack ah that's not me
[24509.90s -> 24516.14s]  that's not me but i'm surprised there's no um there's no sacred tear in there
[24516.94s -> 24536.50s]  yes we need to go down that tree you just beat that poor man's ass yes i did yes i did very much
[24536.50s -> 24553.59s]  so where was the way to get down there this way there's only a couple exceptions usually
[24553.59s -> 24565.48s]  they're in the churches of marika okay well there's a boss i'm not gonna fight that while
[24566.28s -> 24567.00s]  surrounding me
[24570.09s -> 24578.22s]  fucking surrounded by idiots all right it's you know what i'm doing you know what at the time
[24596.38s -> 24601.75s]  what the fuck do you guys keep coming from stage left and stage right where do you people keep
[24601.75s -> 24617.02s]  coming from there's somebody just constantly behind me stop all right what do you got who's this
[24617.74s -> 24709.45s]  her tree appetite bad be better way better hello fuck i didn't know that they that that she was
[24709.45s -> 24740.95s]  i look they just blew up the fucking round you know what fuck the horse baby time what are you
[24740.95s -> 24756.02s]  doing why is it so much rot everywhere what's all the shit everywhere why am i running what
[24756.82s -> 24774.44s]  okay holy damage and rot damage okay please i mean that way i've got that that's this i'm
[24774.44s -> 24814.17s]  gonna destroy this thing get the fuck over here get this fucking puke off me it's a pot it broke
[24814.17s -> 24817.69s]  the pot it broke the pot okay it breaks the pot i didn't know it's gonna break the pot
[24818.57s -> 24843.98s]  maybe rattle is not bad it's really not talk a lot of shit about it but it actually is pretty good
[24844.94s -> 24859.34s]  that move is the only reason to have it on it's pretty easy to predict oh so okay it's one two
[24859.98s -> 24866.06s]  three it takes a while but if you get an opportunity okay if it didn't have the first
[24866.06s -> 24878.86s]  hit this weapon literally throw it into the ocean right the first hit makes this worth having it's
[24878.86s -> 24887.69s]  slow but it's good yeah if it didn't have that first hit it'd be terrible okay cool may have
[24887.69s -> 24893.99s]  been a little over leveled for this one but i have never i haven't been here i'm very curious
[24893.99s -> 24902.04s]  about what that is this flask i didn't even know i existed till fucking halfway through the goddamn
[24902.04s -> 24912.66s]  game where where is that flask shit okay barely boost stamina recovery speed barely blue stamina
[24912.66s -> 24920.92s]  so stamina or stamina recovery speed was fire attack i gotta go to all these trees because i'm
[24921.24s -> 24923.96s]  i guarantee it is like an intelligence one or like a magic one
[24931.56s -> 24946.86s]  ariel keeps pointing this way still there it is okay so here's the dungeon i'll get off my
[24946.86s -> 24965.06s]  horse we'll do this minor urtree catacombs it's one that gives you unlimited fp that would be
[24965.06s -> 24978.02s]  insane i have to imagine i could probably just come in here and clean up because although i mean
[24978.02s -> 24982.58s]  this is not this is seem this is pretty early okay if i if i would have it from limb grave
[24983.88s -> 24990.92s]  go up you know like three days ago i may have come across this area so i'm probably a little
[24990.92s -> 25013.26s]  over leveled for this stuff but it's free shit and i want it this is brought
[25014.14s -> 25054.62s]  it is oh those things are rot on the ground hey we're gonna do boys and girls very good
[25055.42s -> 25059.98s]  okay so why is it still building what's why is it still building i'm not even standing in it what
[25059.98s -> 25072.09s]  was that huh i'm not why is it building why is it building i'm not standing over here
[25072.73s -> 25107.05s]  how do i go up from here how do i go up can i go up soap doesn't do anything i don't see
[25107.05s -> 25117.40s]  anywhere to go up am i insane no there's no i got and maybe back up the elevator
[25118.28s -> 25133.90s]  there's nowhere to go here i'm going to all the way down the elevator for what for that
[25134.70s -> 25171.06s]  oh no right here don't i can't die in here that would be embarrassing even if you're
[25171.06s -> 25185.03s]  over leveled for an area imp cat head whoa this thing's awesome holds trace amount of intelligence
[25186.68s -> 25208.04s]  wait i lose one intelligence but that's so much more defense cat baby is that worth taking off
[25208.04s -> 25215.90s]  the intelligence i mean i'm so much more immunity robustness maybe it's worth just putting on keep
[25215.90s -> 25230.02s]  it on this is the worst outfit like i came out of the trash it looked like like dumpster melted
[25230.02s -> 25242.15s]  action figure baby like this is an action figure that you melted and threw it away just dumpster
[25243.98s -> 25259.62s]  dumpster action figure forked greatsword this is an action league now character
[25260.42s -> 25278.44s]  this is a rick and morty joke or or okay the costume for every horror movie villain from like
[25279.61s -> 25304.94s]  2002 forward every like scary person outfit heavy door is open i kind of like it though
[25304.94s -> 25315.70s]  it's a little too dirty i think i'm going to alter this and take the the bib off and i think i've got
[25315.70s -> 25338.81s]  my character a heavy door opened it's like burnt yucky skin dude what did you expect um where was
[25338.81s -> 25363.69s]  the heavy door after a heavy door no is there a heavy door down there let me i'm gonna alter
[25363.69s -> 25376.74s]  this let me see what it looks like oh i can't take the weird gross skin off of really i have to keep
[25376.74s -> 25426.47s]  the gross skin on i don't want to go through this do i have any more of those anti-rot things
[25427.11s -> 25437.18s]  okay okay first time crafting ever time to make some scarlet rot make seven of them okay i have
[25437.18s -> 25475.48s]  seven so there's a way to go this way this character makes so much noise now with this
[25475.48s -> 25539.86s]  baby rattle oh no grabs oh shit what do i i just i what's up here you're not real excuse me what
[25540.34s -> 25552.95s]  i could be a wolf head this is endurance endurance and okay so you can do endurance
[25552.95s -> 25560.94s]  or intelligence this is more kind of it's kind of more like an alligator than it is a wolf
[25560.94s -> 25580.98s]  i think i'd be a wolf sacramental bud this place is kind of big it's a ton more down there
[25581.70s -> 25592.90s]  uh that's just the beginning of the dungeon right yeah right i think so
[25594.54s -> 25605.45s]  i think of the jungle it looks like alf it did kind of look like alf
[25621.67s -> 25626.55s]  i don't know i better keep the cat away from me i'll eat the cat that guy fucking ate cats
[25627.54s -> 25632.10s]  right like that's kind of weird now thinking about that like 25 years later
[25633.42s -> 25638.14s]  oh i'm gonna eat your cat like you know you're gonna eat the cat at the household like our pet
[25638.78s -> 25647.90s]  he was always talking about like eating their cat like alf fuck off you live here for free you
[25647.90s -> 25653.90s]  stay in it for free if we feed you you don't have to do anything you run like a weird like ham radio
[25653.90s -> 25670.26s]  fucking station out of the basement you're not eating mr fluffy it's not gonna happen boomer show
[25670.26s -> 25682.89s]  can't relate plus old and maybe one day you'll binge it on netflix if it ever goes there the
[25682.89s -> 25701.22s]  dated reference all his references are dated yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry i'm 36 sorry i'm 36
[25703.74s -> 25738.30s]  i remember alf your boss down here or what there is and that's a long run so i better be able to
[25738.30s -> 25743.18s]  one-shot andy i better be able to one-shot andy this it's probably very easy encounter
[25743.18s -> 25746.38s]  don't say that because if you lose you're gonna look like an idiot it's two of those cats
[25747.34s -> 25767.22s]  oh shit oh my god i did so much damage hey let's watch what do you guys say you want to watch
[25767.94s -> 25800.02s]  let's watch all right don't okay let's watch go get him come on baby he's plus eight he better be
[25800.02s -> 25829.94s]  good just do something he's drinking a potion okay is he all right he might do it no you can do it
[25830.02s -> 25834.79s]  come on drink another potion drink another potion another potion you got you got another
[25834.79s -> 25842.10s]  one drink drink drink drink drink drink drink what is he doing that's the worst move in the game
[25842.10s -> 25919.24s]  that's the worst move in the game fuck off mad pumpkin head ashes okay that's kind of cool
[25920.04s -> 25932.70s]  mimic has your genes i'm sorry i would not cast collapsing star at this enemy he was just sitting
[25932.70s -> 25939.22s]  there getting pummeled his brain couldn't figure out what to do this charge r2 does so much damage
[25939.22s -> 25946.07s]  yeah this thing is actually good we just been we gave this way too much shit because the katana
[25946.07s -> 25949.51s]  is just like a broken unbelievable weapon it's the best weapon probably in the whole game
[25949.51s -> 25953.59s]  so everything else by comparisons like wow that thing sucks but no this thing's actually really
[25953.59s -> 25967.00s]  good if you can get this down especially during boss encounters it's like 1200 plus 1500 damage
[25967.00s -> 25975.53s]  when you do it this thing's really cool like eight out of 10 pvpers are using that katana
[25980.38s -> 25987.06s]  yeah i mean that holy shit i like it i think it's actually really cool i think it's it's fun it's
[25987.06s -> 25997.58s]  really cool looking all right so now that i did that let's head back to the entrance striking
[25997.58s -> 26007.02s]  damage yeah that's what i'm saying if you can get both if you hit the cat part and the explosion
[26007.02s -> 26025.27s]  will just is an extra especially when i and you know what all right all right decision has been
[26025.27s -> 26073.06s]  made let's go plus 10 plus nine i think this thing this is going to carry us steak i don't
[26073.06s -> 26084.25s]  think so because i honestly think that that left trigger is arguably arguably better than the
[26084.89s -> 26091.69s]  katana's l2 for one reason because it gives you more than one opportunity to hit it
[26094.14s -> 26104.52s]  this is a one trick andy weapon that's fine this is going to scale well with int it's already
[26104.52s -> 26112.81s]  doing as much damage right now as the katana i'm going to stick with my decision to get the
[26112.81s -> 26131.30s]  baby rattle to plus 10 let's do a little bit of an examination here 179 189 we're at
[26132.26s -> 26148.74s]  what we're going to see this okay 553 545 this has bleed it does which makes it ridiculous
[26148.74s -> 26158.38s]  but this is starting to fall off with magic scaling if both b and c this would be like 5
[26158.38s -> 26179.00s]  like 80 maybe with plus 9 you can compare it okay here we go so why is it lower what b
[26179.72s -> 26187.91s]  is it a lower b is like a b minus this is a plus 10 no it's plus 9 uh plus 9 versus plus 8
[26188.47s -> 26197.27s]  oh it's because of yeah right i mean this is a this is obviously a better weapon right let's be
[26197.27s -> 26214.23s]  obvious but i think this thing is gonna really shine somewhere okay what time is it let's get
[26214.23s -> 26224.81s]  we're getting close uh we're getting close to the end of the stream not quite yet i want to do a
[26224.81s -> 26233.99s]  couple more things i didn't even go to the area that i wanted to go to why is this marked no i
[26233.99s -> 26246.22s]  wanted to do this yeah i want to go to this urn tree because i want to do that painting thing
[26246.94s -> 26276.20s]  so i need to go i need to go this way just mark it i want to see the painting and there's a there's
[26276.20s -> 26285.88s]  probably there's an urn tree avatar that i didn't do here you don't die if you do this right i
[26285.88s -> 26291.42s]  thought you didn't you jumped into those things i thought you didn't if you jump into the wind thing
[26291.98s -> 26319.35s]  like if you jump down into it really i missed i wasn't close enough oh well i made it what is
[26319.35s -> 26330.87s]  what the what's with all the pots there's so many of them but that's accurate though right if i land
[26330.87s -> 26347.40s]  in that i don't get that's accurate right okay yeah i just thought i was losing my mind for a
