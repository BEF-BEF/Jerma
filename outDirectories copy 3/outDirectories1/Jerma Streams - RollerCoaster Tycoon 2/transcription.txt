[1.21s -> 12.28s]  I am back. Let's change the game and the title of the stream to roller coaster. How about um
[16.04s -> 21.13s]  coast? I'm just kind of chill and play roller coaster. What's what's a good title?
[27.02s -> 40.94s]  Roller boffin? How about just rct2? Just roller coaster tycoon 2. Twitch integration? Unfortunately
[40.94s -> 47.98s]  twitch integration no longer exists. The server that was hosting it is no longer online. So the
[47.98s -> 52.86s]  only way you can do twitch integration unfortunately is I would have to open and run my own server on
[52.86s -> 60.76s]  my own computer with the uh it's no longer operational anymore. I have to make my own server
[61.80s -> 65.64s]  and that was going to take longer. I mean I was I wanted to start streaming so
[65.64s -> 75.83s]  so let me move over here yeah and there was other reasons why I didn't really want to do that
[75.83s -> 80.15s]  immediately. Like I'll just turn it on and run like a java server on my own computer.
[80.15s -> 83.83s]  I feel like there's some security holes there that I would need to make sure weren't there.
[87.67s -> 102.36s]  All right uh hold on I'm just gonna write roller coaster tycoon 2 on sale now. No
[103.24s -> 115.27s]  whatever it doesn't matter. Roller coaster tycoon 2 with germa.
[125.34s -> 129.77s]  That would be so bad. I can fix it later. We'll come up with a better
[129.77s -> 133.43s]  we'll we'll come up with a better one. All right let me get it open.
[133.43s -> 141.94s]  I mean we're talking like a true nostalgia factor right here. Don't ask me why it was
[141.94s -> 147.70s]  today was the day we were going to play this. But it is. Can you hear it? I bet you so badly
[147.70s -> 153.54s]  you guys want me to change the screen right now and listen to that. You remember that?
[164.71s -> 174.39s]  All right start a new park. Roller coaster tycoon 2. Nope never mind.
[175.03s -> 188.74s]  There it is. All right so what do I want to start with? My own park or should I gotta like
[188.74s -> 205.93s]  kind of remember how to play? How about crazy castle? Yeah this is open rct. Build your own
[205.93s -> 213.27s]  six flags adventure. Build your own six flags. Okay I okay you gotta I remember this stuff.
[215.05s -> 218.89s]  Build your own design a six flags park to build rides and other six flags parks are designed
[218.89s -> 224.17s]  and build your own. You have to have 1500 quests in your park at the end of October year four with
[224.17s -> 229.21s]  a park rating of at least 600. All right so there are some things that I remember that I played
[229.21s -> 235.91s]  this game a lot when I was younger. I played roller coaster tycoon 3. I think even on this stream or
[235.91s -> 243.66s]  on a video before. Admission price. What I typically do is I make the we I do it just like they do at
[243.66s -> 249.74s]  every six flags you've ever been to. The park admission is like 30 or 40 bucks. Like 20 bucks.
[251.93s -> 259.98s]  All the rides are free and then you just you just drain them at the concession stand. I'm not going
[259.98s -> 265.90s]  to charge for toilets. That would make me a monster. But we need stuff here first. Let's pause it.
[266.95s -> 272.68s]  How much money do I have? Okay remember I can remember the controls. You can you can spin it
[272.68s -> 278.89s]  around too can't you? So let's hold right click. Zoom in. Zoom out. I like the zoom in. It's fine.
[278.89s -> 288.73s]  Okay so we need this is I gotta name the park. What is it called? Where's my where's my name
[288.73s -> 298.86s]  the park thing here? I think I have to open it first. So I got a big open land. Let's do
[298.86s -> 308.73s]  let's just get everything laid out. Let's do like just dirt. Let's go dirt. Well it's already kind
[308.73s -> 322.30s]  of this the stone right? I mean I can't do it when the game is paused. Why not? Let's go up here. I'm
[322.30s -> 328.38s]  thinking a little little line this way. How much money do I have? Where's my total money? 9,700.
[329.02s -> 339.48s]  You got to start very slow. So I'm thinking hamburger stand hamburger stand ferris wheel
[339.48s -> 346.76s]  and then that's it and open it. Where are my rides? Where's my ride development? I know I have that
[346.76s -> 356.49s]  somewhere. His rides. I'm thinking the choo choo train. Slow. No no no no no no. Just hear me out.
[356.49s -> 365.66s]  I'm thinking the monorail around the entire park. Is it R to switch? No no no no stop.
[365.66s -> 369.29s]  You know what I mean? Have the monorail go all the way around the whole thing.
[370.49s -> 377.78s]  You'll get on this ride. It'll take like three hours. You can see everything. So let's go ahead
[377.78s -> 387.30s]  and get this made. I want to flip it this way. So to know actually it should be like this because
[387.30s -> 404.86s]  then I can have it be going all the way around. Let's go like this. Forward. Okay all right that
[404.86s -> 415.99s]  looks all right. Now let's go ahead and start building the track. Oh shit. I have to do the
[416.63s -> 422.76s]  doesn't this cost a lot of money? This is insanely expensive from what I remember.
[422.76s -> 437.03s]  How much is it gonna cost? 90 bucks? Oh for the love of god that's way too much money.
[438.42s -> 458.26s]  I'm just gonna cut it this way. I'm gonna use this as the edge here. All right can I cut it now?
[458.82s -> 471.14s]  Let's see. Let's go forward one right here. Okay let's see. Can I cut it? I think so.
[473.48s -> 489.06s]  Yep all right we're good. All right how much is this? 157 dollars per? No keep going up a
[489.06s -> 505.11s]  little more. No back it up. What's the point of a monorail? I don't think there is one.
[505.11s -> 516.39s]  No go back. Back up. I have to back this up. I turned it a little. No I didn't. That's all right.
[516.95s -> 551.66s]  All right it doesn't need to be exact. Just like it has to be close enough. This is a big park.
[551.66s -> 566.89s]  I don't think this is. I'm gonna run out of money before I do this. Okay uh let's go. Let's close it.
[568.66s -> 572.98s]  This is not a roller coaster. This is a road. This is just a you can ride around and view the park.
[572.98s -> 579.70s]  How many miles is this? Take out the loans? No no no all right. Well this will we'll keep this here.
[581.37s -> 587.85s]  I'm gonna build out this way first. This is a huge park. Big big big big park. It's okay.
[588.57s -> 608.26s]  This will work out. This is actually this is not bad because this will be my area to build.
[608.26s -> 671.10s]  I just need to go up. Oh yeah the monorail is sitting on the ground.
[675.50s -> 680.20s]  Yeah that's right. It is just on the ground. How are you gonna see everything?
[680.20s -> 685.80s]  This is the slow moving car on a track. It's all right. People will like it. The kids. This is for
[685.80s -> 718.34s]  the kids. The kids will love this shit. I was good. I was always so bad at trying to do this shit
[721.08s -> 789.19s]  because you got to match it up. Oh I can do better anyways.
[827.67s -> 842.89s]  All right so I'm gonna go like this. That's a good start. No monorail. I'm not doing the monorail.
[842.89s -> 849.05s]  It's like we're gonna start easy. We're gonna start with like the haunted the ferris wheel.
[849.05s -> 857.42s]  You start with the ferris wheel every time. Oh the maze. This one's fun. No no no. I need like an
[857.42s -> 865.99s]  information center first. Okay we've got funnel cakes, hot dog stall. Where's like the info center
[865.99s -> 873.86s]  and balloons? Yeah bathroom. Not yet. Let's put ATMs. These are important here. ATM here.
[877.02s -> 891.00s]  Go ahead and open it. Okay let's get another ATM. Let's go ahead and open it. Is it already open?
[891.96s -> 903.64s]  They both opened. Good. All right. It's off center. It's fine. I can. It doesn't matter. It's
[903.64s -> 906.84s]  un- why? Why is there no music? Yeah this is supposed to be music in this game.
[907.48s -> 924.02s]  What's going on? Guess can't get to the entrance of cash machine one. Yeah the park's not open.
[924.66s -> 940.46s]  I don't understand. What are they? What are they? How do you move shit around?
[941.26s -> 955.02s]  Can I not pick it up? Spin it this way. It's because the thing the lip wasn't there. All right.
[955.98s -> 960.25s]  All right so let's open them up. To uh now we're gonna have a small ride here.
[963.42s -> 972.54s]  I want and um should I do food? Yeah let's do burgers. Burger food right at the entrance.
[973.18s -> 979.78s]  No I'm not gonna rebuild the monorail. I turned that turned into a disaster.
[981.42s -> 985.18s]  Food right at the entrance. I bought anytime that I go to a place like a Six Flags. I always want
[985.18s -> 994.50s]  food right at the front door. We're going here. Right at the front door. Burger price. Make it
[994.50s -> 1000.01s]  same throughout the park. Profit per item. It's gonna be a dollar sixty. Remember this is like
[1000.01s -> 1004.33s]  1994 prices. So you're probably like what the fuck dude? What are you talking about man? It's
[1004.33s -> 1011.78s]  like should be six. No dollar sixty. This is like back in like the fucking 30s. Let's get uh now
[1011.78s -> 1020.26s]  we let's get two burgers. No we got a variety. Put on the Animal Crossing OST. You got it.
[1020.90s -> 1037.90s]  How do I like pause this? Animal Crossing soundtrack collection. Complete edition.
[1039.08s -> 1046.95s]  All right get comfortable because this is going to be a real snooze. That's not a way you should
[1046.95s -> 1059.93s]  describe your live stream. There we are. Just sit in the background. Get under the covers you know.
[1061.85s -> 1074.12s]  Wait isn't it like four o'clock in the afternoon? All right go to bed if you're like 78. Okay here
[1074.12s -> 1084.63s]  we go. So we got the burger stand. Let's go with a french fries right next to it. What do you say?
[1085.27s -> 1094.01s]  The game's paused. How much are the french fries? Same price throughout the park. Let's make them
[1094.01s -> 1105.78s]  uh let's make them a dollar forty. Make them a little cheaper. So we got burgers fries. What
[1105.78s -> 1108.90s]  the hell else are we gonna do here? How about a pretzels stall? Yeah that's a good snack.
[1109.86s -> 1115.94s]  Pretzels would be a little cheaper. A lot of people. We got a lot of foot traffic here.
[1118.20s -> 1127.46s]  Make them 90 cents. Okay let's uh I think we need drinks too. How could we forget lemonade?
[1127.46s -> 1144.79s]  Uh lemonade price. Dollar 20. Make it the same throughout the park. Dollar 40. What I should do
[1144.79s -> 1150.47s]  is I should make I should have no drinks and to scream on a big intercom. Hold a cup outside.
[1151.35s -> 1168.07s]  It's free. We'll do a soda as well. Is this spongebob music or is this?
[1170.14s -> 1173.34s]  No no that's too clustered too clustered. I don't want to do that. We need a ride.
[1174.06s -> 1180.01s]  We're doing a nice relaxing easy ride. We're doing an intro ferris wheel right here.
[1180.81s -> 1188.65s]  The line doesn't have to be very long although these ones always have a ton of people that
[1188.65s -> 1200.44s]  care about them for some dumb reason. This is the entrance right and here's the exit. All right
[1201.40s -> 1210.62s]  so uh ferris wheel. Okay no forward rotation. Number of rotations. One. Reliability. Inspection
[1210.62s -> 1220.60s]  time. Every 30 minutes is fine. I want it to be uh we got to be a central theme here. Ice. No.
[1221.62s -> 1230.18s]  Space. No. Plane. What's wrong with one rotation? It goes around once. It takes like 25 minutes.
[1230.74s -> 1241.78s]  The theme should be pretzel. I don't think I can do a pretzel theme. Gravy? No that's castle. How
[1241.78s -> 1248.10s]  am I going to do pretzel themed? I mean the log cabin should all right let's we're doing this is
[1248.10s -> 1260.70s]  a pretzel park. Log cabin. That's all right that's fine. It's really it's very ugly but it's okay.
[1261.26s -> 1274.36s]  Okay admission price it's free or should it be like five cents? No. Okay that's fine. It is now
[1274.36s -> 1281.50s]  ready to test. I need to get a queue in there. Just go with the standard queue. That's fine.
[1285.18s -> 1289.58s]  And then I don't I'm one of those people that doesn't like to have the queue be I like having
[1289.58s -> 1298.76s]  a clean exit not the queue exit. Am I charging? Only am. Charge for admission. All right so far

[1341.85s -> 1353.19s]  else. Just stay at the front door. Thank you. That's his path. I'm walking around. All right
[1353.19s -> 1361.14s]  I need to now should I open the park with one ride? I have to start making money. We have an
[1361.14s -> 1370.50s]  astronaut, a ferris wheel, and food. Okay should I make the park like a dollar? This is not even
[1370.50s -> 1382.76s]  worth going to. Five dollars. No it's no no no not yet. No no no no it's not. I gotta make two more

[1579.05s -> 1610.87s]  all spooky in here. Why is this so slow? This is too slow. There's no draw. That's supposed to be
[1610.87s -> 1626.28s]  a drop. Sports car. Vintage car. No make it cats. Continuous circuit. Wait for a full load. Don't

[1638.89s -> 1648.41s]  let's make this like... I don't like the red. That's not bad. Oh it's gonna be pretzel related
[1648.41s -> 1670.25s]  right? I'm gonna step in and say I'm not doing that. I'll be able to just say different colors

[1733.06s -> 1749.93s]  Can I make it faster? I can't make it faster. All right so that's ready. Why is my park for babies?
[1750.65s -> 1761.62s]  Do you see how much space I have here? I need money before I I only have 5,400 bucks. You have
[1761.62s -> 1770.12s]  the cheap cheesy rides at the front and then like the real daredevils have to go around back here.
[1770.12s -> 1774.28s]  You don't want to have your kids walking all around if you got them in like strollers and stuff. No
[1774.28s -> 1783.26s]  you have all this stuff really close to the food to the the atm's and the bathrooms. Don't you
[1783.26s -> 1796.26s]  understand? All right so that one's good. Let's get a cue on it. Okay that's that. Get that fresh
[1796.26s -> 1826.71s]  cobblestone. All right I need some decorations because I hate this. What are those trees?

[1994.34s -> 2007.56s]  around in my fucking helicopter. That's for me. Actually let me get some seating here. Seating
[2007.56s -> 2015.48s]  in front of the ATM. You gotta have seats and trash cans too. Next to all the food stalls. I
[2015.48s -> 2020.44s]  remember that was very important in this video game. Trash. Trash. Trash. Have a place to throw
[2020.44s -> 2028.76s]  you trash. All right. It's coming together pretty well. I think. This is a fun little ride. I got
[2028.76s -> 2036.12s]  my little secret like garden area. Let's get a tree over here. I don't like a couple of trees.
[2036.92s -> 2051.83s]  No I don't like those. I need some. I want bushes. Little ones. No don't like that either.
[2052.63s -> 2062.31s]  Don't need. I don't need anything over there. No I can put stores and stuff. Don't need it.
[2062.95s -> 2068.60s]  All right. So I got two rides. Here comes a good. Here comes a wild ride. All right. We're gonna do
[2068.60s -> 2084.41s]  something fun. I'm thinking the go-karts. Castle carts. I mean this one's cool. Yeah.
[2085.27s -> 2099.14s]  Automobile antics. Vehicle design unavailable. What do you mean unavailable? Do these go fast?
[2100.78s -> 2103.42s]  No. I already have a cart right there. I'm not doing another cart ride.
[2104.38s -> 2111.43s]  We'll do the pirate ship. Everybody hates this. Give us the monorail. I don't have enough money
[2111.43s -> 2119.90s]  to make that. What am I spending money on? Money's being deleted. This is. I'll put this right here.
[2126.06s -> 2170.18s]  Yeah. You want to talk about park design? Oh shit. It's the wrong way. How do I flip it? How do I
[2170.18s -> 2187.53s]  flip? I can't. I can get up there right? Usually can't you just put your cursor and it does it
[2187.53s -> 2220.74s]  right in front? It's an oil drill. Oh okay. There we go. Damn it. It's okay. It's all right. I remember
[2220.74s -> 2231.34s]  everyone was saying this is uneven. Now I can be fixed. Uneven German. Uneven German. Right. That's
[2231.34s -> 2242.31s]  what I'm saying. So now I can fix this. Okay. So that's done. Let's go up from here. It's this
[2242.31s -> 2252.46s]  little one here. Bang. Bang. Bingo. Now that's going to be cool. Now I'm into that. All right.
[2252.46s -> 2259.86s]  So that's that. Let's spin it back around. Let's take a look at pirate ships. Swinging inverted
[2259.86s -> 2267.98s]  ship. That's all I can do. Number of swings. Swing mode. All right. Number of swings.
[2270.90s -> 2283.42s]  Two. One. Eight. Let's increase our productivity by like 10,000 percent. Durability. All right. I want
[2283.42s -> 2291.22s]  to do. Let's do. It's kind of part of this ride in a way. Let me see what this looks like.
[2291.22s -> 2332.10s]  No. We got to do some like some actual color coordination here. This is cool. And then these
[2332.10s -> 2335.62s]  people drive down and they'll see it. And it'll be like whoa. It's like going over your head.
[2342.36s -> 2349.94s]  I need one more ride and then I'm going to open the park. Has this guy got any water? It's been
[2349.94s -> 2359.75s]  like four days. Okay. Let's go over here. Final ride that I'm going to make is going to be a
[2359.75s -> 2363.43s]  coaster. And it's got to be a little shitty one because I don't have enough money.
[2364.41s -> 2373.48s]  See like from 2500. Spiral. How much does this one cost? Seven thousand. Seventy two. Eleven
[2373.48s -> 2378.36s]  thousand. Why didn't I get one of these? Look at how awesome that is. I don't have enough money.
[2384.60s -> 2390.42s]  Now I need to make money first then. I'm ready to open the park. I need a. How's research doing?
[2391.56s -> 2405.11s]  Take out a loan? No. That's not how you win. I need a bathroom. Let's put bathrooms. I wish I
[2405.11s -> 2431.46s]  could do it here. In fact let's do this. Let's fix this. There we go. Is that one? One more. Nice.
[2431.46s -> 2445.90s]  All right. It is time to open the park. Welcome. Except wait. Give me a janitor and an engineer.
[2447.14s -> 2459.78s]  Okay. Come on in everybody. It's only eight dollars. Welcome to Six Flags. Six Flags. How
[2459.78s -> 2508.79s]  do I change the name? Why isn't it over here? Here we go. First customer. Carl S. Oh Carl S.
[2512.34s -> 2542.73s]  Welcome to the Big Top. I don't know. The Big Top Circus and Resort. Got it. What do you mean boo?
[2542.73s -> 2555.32s]  What's wrong with the Big Top? All right. Where are they going? People getting in line? What's
[2555.32s -> 2559.99s]  wrong? Recent thoughts. Where are you going? Somebody. Look at they're going. Already going
[2559.99s -> 2566.04s]  to the garden. They love it. Is this person leaving? I don't want to go on something more.
[2566.04s -> 2569.80s]  I want to go on something more thrilling than the ferris wheel. We'll get on the this one.
[2570.52s -> 2580.07s]  That's what this is for. Is everybody on these rides? No they're not. They're not testing.
[2580.07s -> 2602.33s]  They're all open. Oh the pressure is starting to mount here. I'm not hungry. The in-game music.
[2602.89s -> 2628.22s]  All right. I'll turn it off. There we go. I need to name this something. The the oopsie daisy. This
[2628.22s -> 2652.36s]  one is just ferris wheel. F wheel. This one's called. This one's called Bumperda Bumper. And
[2652.36s -> 2664.31s]  I think that's it. They're getting in line. Look. They're already riding the car. There they are.
[2664.31s -> 2675.86s]  They're so happy to be here. How much money do I have? 33,000. Nobody's in there. No thoughts on
[2675.86s -> 2689.11s]  the funnel cakes. Where are people going? I'm not thirsty. I'm not hungry. I'm tired. What would
[2689.11s -> 2693.11s]  mean I'm tired? Why are you here? I want to go something more thrilling than Bumperda Bumper.
[2693.11s -> 2696.23s]  I want to go on something more thrilling than F wheel. I'm not thirsty. I'm tired.
[2697.19s -> 2727.24s]  These are easy. Motion simulator. Film. Avenging aviators. Thrill riders.
[2728.84s -> 2737.00s]  Okay. That's fine. No music. All right. Let's go. Open it up. Open. I don't need to test it.
[2737.94s -> 2753.35s]  Open. Let's get it over there. That's thrilling. What are they saying? I'm not hungry. I'm not
[2753.35s -> 2770.30s]  hungry. We'll get in line. This is VR. Okay. They're just walking around and not finally.
[2770.30s -> 2778.70s]  There's people getting in line for this. New vehicle available for Steel Twister. Floorless
[2778.70s -> 2789.75s]  Twister train. I need more money. It's like 50 bucks. Oh, they line it up. They actually like
[2789.75s -> 2796.41s]  this one. Look at it. It's the first line that actually has a line. Uh-oh. Oh, shit. I have to
[2796.41s -> 2809.27s]  make this longer. I'm going to charge more money. 12 bucks to get them. Oh, there we go. People
[2809.27s -> 2821.03s]  starting to fill in here. 81 people here. I told you this was going to be a good idea.
[2822.01s -> 2832.12s]  This is not that cool though. Has anybody been buying these? Zero per hour. Burger sold zero.
[2835.75s -> 2844.17s]  Why? Is there a reason why? Too expensive? $1.40. $1.20. I mean, people have to start buying these.
[2845.58s -> 2857.46s]  90 cents. It's fine. $1.20. What are you doing? All right. What's popular right now? I've got
[2857.46s -> 2866.46s]  2,800 bucks. Don't they usually say, oh, this park is a big value? The park is really clean.
[2867.34s -> 2876.94s]  I want something more thrilling. On Oopsy-Daisy, queuing for VR sim, walking, queuing for Oopsy-Daisy.
[2876.94s -> 2882.14s]  People really love the Oopsy-Daisy. I should make two of these. Yeah, I'm just going to make two
[2882.14s -> 2933.48s]  of them back to back. Making sense portraits. Turn this way maybe. I think I can still do it. If I
[2933.48s -> 2945.54s]  go like this and then like that and then can I turn it this way? Damn it. I can't just go that
[2945.54s -> 2954.06s]  way with this. Wait, I can go that way. That's not going to do it. I don't think that's going to work
[2954.06s -> 2985.19s]  though. Pulse there. Okay, hold on. Done. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2985.19s -> 3004.78s]  Hold on. Now this is actually kind of damn cool. I will say for myself. Now just hold on a minute
[3004.78s -> 3013.74s]  here. Look at this. Look at what I've done. Look at what I'm capable of, mom. Now check this out.
[3014.38s -> 3025.14s]  Now we've got to connect this in a very, very convincing way. So I'm going to say we can go
[3026.10s -> 3032.25s]  we gotta go around here and this is going to take us to the next part of the park.
[3044.87s -> 3058.86s]  Yep, nothing goes upside down. Okay, now just open it. Test it and open it. Try to make a third one.
[3058.86s -> 3062.38s]  Should I make four of these just back to back to back right here? They can't hit each other,
[3062.38s -> 3071.75s]  right? This one's going to swing for less time. Okay, let's do the same color scheme.
[3071.75s -> 3091.05s]  Looking good. So open it. That's fine. There it is. What was this called? Oopsie daisy.
[3091.77s -> 3096.79s]  Oopsie daisy. They gotta have a similar name because they're right next to each other.
[3096.79s -> 3111.24s]  Um whoopsie daisy and whoops uh whoopsie did whoopsie oopsie daisy and whoopsie daisy.
[3112.04s -> 3118.28s]  Whatever. All right, that's done. Now that's kind of cool.
[3121.21s -> 3127.11s]  That's an attraction if I've ever seen one before and this one can hold way more people than this
[3127.11s -> 3132.39s]  one. See this is what they don't understand. This ride is faster than this one. This one's
[3132.39s -> 3142.07s]  longer with a shorter line. This one's faster with a longer line. Now I got 2,300 bucks.
[3142.71s -> 3159.37s]  What do I want to do now with this? I want to go out here. I got 191 people here. I need to
[3159.37s -> 3171.42s]  charge more money because I'm not making anything. 15. Turn down the crowd volume. Is it too loud?
[3172.22s -> 3178.92s]  This is really starting to fill up. Everyone's realizing what's going on here. All right.
[3178.92s -> 3186.04s]  Uh do I have enough to do anything? I need like a coaster or uh I don't have enough money. I need
[3186.04s -> 3196.09s]  like a little one. Mini roller coaster. Here we go. Crazy crabs. 5,000. What if I do I need to
[3196.09s -> 3200.01s]  save this because I'm going to try to just do one that goes up down really hard and then rips around
[3200.01s -> 3212.81s]  his ends. Uh let's save it as auto save. I guess it's just auto saving. That's all right.
[3214.49s -> 3225.42s]  All right it's auto saving. Look at how fucking huge this line is. All right here's the diabolical
[3225.42s -> 3236.95s]  plan. Are you ready? Number of swings. Oh I was gonna make it like five. Oh the the crowd's
[3236.95s -> 3257.34s]  getting is drowning out the actual music. I see what you're saying. I'm starting to get a profit now.
[3257.98s -> 3273.29s]  Is the burger stand closed? Yeah. It's one of the fry stalls. Whatever. It's okay. I want to make a
[3273.29s -> 3282.39s]  roller coaster. I can do it. Here we go. Mini coaster. I'm gonna do my own and it's gonna be
[3282.39s -> 3290.84s]  over here. Back here it's gonna start. It's gonna be a small one but it's gonna be crazy. That's
[3290.84s -> 3301.90s]  enough to go up and then down right? What if I just do one car? I can delete this. I can sell it later.
[3316.70s -> 3324.68s]  No I need one now. Three. All right. Okay here we go. Here we go. That's that's fine.
[3325.48s -> 3341.70s]  I'm gonna go up with the chain. I'm watching my money closely here. Does this have a chain on it?
[3343.83s -> 3356.25s]  No it doesn't. Back it up. Back it up. Wait back it up. Okay that's it. That's it. That's it. No more.
[3357.05s -> 3371.22s]  Let's turn. A big turn. How much money? 1,900. I gotta close it now. All right then straight down.
[3384.31s -> 3402.52s]  1,500. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm just making Mario's circuit from Mario Kart Super Nintendo
[3402.52s -> 3422.57s]  Edition. Got it. Done. Okay I got that. Now this is gonna be good. What would I just get? Oh shit.
[3422.57s -> 3428.25s]  I need. Wait wait wait. Quick. How do I make umbrellas? Umbrellas umbrellas umbrellas. Umbrellas.
[3428.25s -> 3471.30s]  Where do I get them? Hat stall. Umbrellas. Buy one. It's not open. What is obscene? I'm not sure.
[3471.30s -> 3509.11s]  What's obscene? 10 bucks. I'm making it all back. Can you imagine going to a park and it starts to
[3509.11s -> 3515.99s]  rain and you're walking by a stall which there's a little ticker but by the second the price of the
[3515.99s -> 3525.00s]  of the umbrella is increasing. All right let's go back down. Back down. Back down. It's fine.
[3525.80s -> 3532.97s]  Hi. The person in front of you. Hi I'd like to buy an umbrella. That'll be 14 dollars please.
[3533.05s -> 3538.65s]  No it's my turn. I'd like to buy an umbrella. That'll be 18 dollars please. Get out of here.
[3539.37s -> 3548.74s]  All right I just made a shitload of money. Let's go back to like six. Seven. Six fifty. It is now.
[3548.74s -> 3556.63s]  This is a better park. Let's increase the price to about 25. Hell yeah. All right let's go up here
[3556.63s -> 3570.50s]  and test this coaster. Test it. What's it look like? What's it like? It's just a little one.
[3570.50s -> 3575.56s]  It's just a little guy with three. See how much how crazy this is.
[3576.76s -> 3604.36s]  Lift hill chain speed faster than that. Let's take a look. Why is it not showing? That's pretty cool.
[3609.02s -> 3627.13s]  10 miles per hour. Is it talking this one right now? I don't understand. How fast does it go?
[3627.85s -> 3640.49s]  I mean this thing goes 45 miles per hour. This thing almost goes 50. All right that's fine. Wait.
[3641.45s -> 3645.42s]  Excitement rating medium. Intensity medium. Medium. You don't want it to be too crazy.
[3646.22s -> 3655.70s]  Okay leave maximum wait time 10 seconds. I think it's free. What about the car? I want to change
[3655.70s -> 3687.77s]  the colors here. Can I? Yeah. That's ugly. Hold on. That's very ugly. There we go. Now I'm ready to
[3687.77s -> 3695.98s]  open it. Let's go. I feel like there's going to be a line for this one. So we're going to do a little
[3695.98s -> 3728.12s]  bit of an interesting squiggle here. Welcome to the ride. I'm going to call this one whatever the
[3728.12s -> 3742.20s]  name of that level is. Look at that. They're already flooding in. This is perfect. They're already
[3742.20s -> 3759.10s]  just getting in there piling in. I told you this had to be done like this. This is going to fill
[3759.10s -> 3775.93s]  up real quick. Look at them going to the ATM. 35 bucks to get in. Let's take a look. How are we
[3775.93s -> 3782.22s]  doing? I'm not hungry. This park is really clean. I want to go something more thrilling though. I
[3782.22s -> 3790.04s]  just got that. More thrilling. It's already here. I feel sick. Why? Where is this person?
[3796.07s -> 3805.67s]  I feel sick. Heading to bumper to bumper. This thing is so popular. Luigi's Circuit was great.
[3805.67s -> 3826.31s]  Yes it was. Wasn't it? Why is that me hungry? I have a general. Are these selling? Okay it's yeah
[3827.03s -> 3846.33s]  five burgers have been sold. Why? Let's go this way with the park. What's wrong with you?
[3849.32s -> 3853.80s]  This is going to be an impossible ride to fill up. All right what have I got?
[3853.80s -> 3865.51s]  4,000. I'm turning a profit. I'm going to say we should do something else like a little
[3866.79s -> 3875.48s]  what's the word for research? Vertical shuttle cars. No I don't want to do that. I want to focus on
[3876.44s -> 3884.76s]  no shops and sceneries. No water rides. No gentle rides. Thrill rides and roller coasters and shops.
[3886.12s -> 3898.23s]  Marketing campaign. We're going to do a marketing campaign for a ride. I need another one of these.
[3898.23s -> 3927.26s]  They're getting too full. Is this going to work? This is going to crash into each other.
[3944.84s -> 3950.38s]  Give the people what they want. You know I agree. Which way do you have to be facing?
[3968.47s -> 3974.15s]  All right this is look if they want to ride it. Look at how big of a line this is. It's ridiculous.
[3975.19s -> 4058.15s]  All right I need this. VR sim. What's wrong with it? No. There's like puke all over the place.
[4060.47s -> 4063.75s]  78 people are in this line and you guys didn't want me to do this?
[4064.63s -> 4083.45s]  All right let's go. I need to connect it. I'll put some benches in it. Maybe a store right here.
[4084.41s -> 4129.14s]  Fire chip. Seven. Let's get it the right color scheme. Who's trapped? All right I need another
[4129.14s -> 4137.58s]  janitor. 4,400 bucks. I'm doing great. Who's trapped? Who's trapped? Where? I want to go home.
[4138.22s -> 4152.12s]  Who? You can find your way out of here. Look at uh people. I can't keep these lines empty.
[4153.00s -> 4170.70s]  It's because I separated the roads. Yeah they're. Wait a minute. Is this fucked up? Hold on. Wait
[4170.70s -> 4214.36s]  wait. I didn't want it like this. There we go. Everyone's fine. Where is it? Where is it? All
[4214.36s -> 4223.11s]  right. I need a janitor. I need a new janitor. Another janitor. Somewhere. We're gonna. I'm
[4223.11s -> 4229.96s]  gonna have to have you patrol over here because it's dirty. It's fucking dirty over here. You need
[4229.96s -> 4246.55s]  to be like around here. This area. That's where you go. Still raining. I need more barrels too.
[4249.05s -> 4254.01s]  Just keep it at 20. What if somebody wants to buy one though? Like randomly just to buy one.
[4254.81s -> 4263.91s]  They're not going to confirm buy one unless there's a reason. 10,000 dollars an hour.
[4264.63s -> 4282.17s]  Wouldn't that be nice? Look at how popular this one is. What's wrong with this? Why is
[4282.17s -> 4294.55s]  nobody on the line for this one? What's going on here? What's wrong? Nobody want to ride this one?
[4294.55s -> 4300.63s]  I'm not going on pirate ship one while it's raining. Okay I get my pirate ship one. Excuse me.
[4311.35s -> 4326.42s]  Luigi's circuit has broken down. How? Wait. Are the people still on it? What? I need an engineer.
[4327.06s -> 4339.38s]  Why are the people still riding this? There he comes. All right good. I need one more uh one more
[4339.38s -> 4358.89s]  engineer and a security guard. Okay and barrels and more shops. Yeah I need more shops. I need
[4358.89s -> 4370.65s]  more benches. Let's get some more stores. I need I want a fountain. A giant ice cube. Uh yeah like
[4370.65s -> 4381.14s]  right here. Look cool. That's kind of cool. That's cool just to look at. Um wait a minute.
[4381.78s -> 4423.94s]  This is too this is too cramped. I don't like it. I don't like it. It's too cramped. I don't
[4423.94s -> 4433.14s]  can I get rid of it? I don't think I can get rid of it. Does it cost money to look at the ice cube?
[4434.10s -> 4448.54s]  You have to crap my pants at the amusement park. Okay there it goes. I now have enough money to
[4448.54s -> 4454.73s]  make another coaster and the next coaster is going to cross across this one. You know what I'm saying?
[4455.37s -> 4477.14s]  This one's going to be fucked. Reverse freefall coaster. Check this out. Yep. How much is this?
[4477.94s -> 4491.93s]  4,000? 3,900? Now this is going to be that's pretty. Poster inside of the coaster.
[4492.73s -> 4540.79s]  That doesn't crash right? Okay yeah it's fine. All right we gotta change the what's with the
[4540.79s -> 4555.53s]  red platform. Okay reverse freefall car. Full load. All right you can't do anything else.
[4555.53s -> 4576.01s]  That looks good. I wish I could change the color of that. Can I? Let's give it a test. Nice. All right.
[4576.73s -> 4592.34s]  Put more speed on it. I don't think I can. No it's already very intense. This thing goes up to 70
[4592.34s -> 4627.27s]  miles per hour. Make it taller. That's too high. That's way too high. Is that too much? That's like
[4627.27s -> 4640.95s]  a test of strength. It doesn't even go up halfway. How do I make it go faster? I need to increase the
[4640.95s -> 4669.29s]  power? How do I do that? Close it. Like this thing back here? It gains speed from the straight track
[4669.29s -> 4677.69s]  pieces. It's the gear tab of the ride. Yeah but I was just. No it's not. No I can't do that.
[4680.50s -> 4694.06s]  Do you want to refurbish horse mine? No. That's not there. The other gear? Yeah is it in here?
[4694.94s -> 4713.88s]  I think I have to make more of these sections. So I need to go like this then. I should have
[4713.88s -> 4773.53s]  just made this myself. What a waste of money. Better? Let's try it. No. It's gonna have to do.
[4774.25s -> 4797.22s]  Let me take it down one two three. Now that's a real scary ride. I want it to be like you're
[4797.22s -> 4803.70s]  just about to go over it and like fly off the ride. Just barely one more. Make it like
[4804.50s -> 4812.01s]  holy shit it's going over the thing. Yeah I think that's a good idea. Let's see if it works. The
[4812.01s -> 4839.77s]  name of this ride is going to be called just barely. Oh just barely. Just barely. Any more
[4839.77s -> 4847.70s]  force and you're off. Bumper to bumper broke down? What is it? What even is bumper to bumper? Oh the
[4847.70s -> 4859.66s]  thing underneath this mess. How does this break down? Now this thing's ready to go. Okay let's get
[4859.66s -> 4870.38s]  that car. Cool. The color scheme's gotta be different. This is gonna be orange. Orange
[4870.38s -> 4877.38s]  cars to make a match with this. This track is wrong. That's better. Actually I kind of like
[4877.38s -> 4895.13s]  the orange. I like the orange. Yeah it works with this. Cool. What's the intensity by the way? Good
[4895.13s -> 4904.92s]  for rating. Very high. Yeah good luck on that one. You want intense? I'll give you intense.
[4905.72s -> 4928.07s]  All right I think I need to. That's better. This is getting a little loud. I think it's ready to
[4928.07s -> 4941.37s]  open as we make the kiosks. Wait how the hell do you get up and down and out of here?
[4956.66s -> 4972.20s]  Make stairs go on to here? The path in the back. Oh okay I see. This one. Ah it's the face of the
[4972.20s -> 4984.12s]  bumper. Because you go in here and go that's the line. All right so then I fucked this up it's okay.
[4984.12s -> 5009.35s]  Okay now I'm going to connect this. The VR sim has broken down like three times.
[5010.55s -> 5015.03s]  This needs to be connected over here so we're going to build out. I think I want to go
[5016.07s -> 5031.66s]  from here. Yeah let's build out from there. I'm gonna make this a double sidewalk. Triple sidewalk
[5031.66s -> 5042.30s]  because this is ugly. This is very very very ugly. What have I just done? What'd I do? What'd I do?
[5042.30s -> 5055.03s]  What'd I do? What'd I do? Oh okay well please replace that. All right so that's ugly. Let's
[5055.03s -> 5062.01s]  go up this way with it. I know everyone's gonna freak out. I got it. One two three four five six
[5062.01s -> 5068.01s]  seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen. Therefore seven. One two three four
[5068.01s -> 5077.61s]  five six. Seven is the middle. One two three four five six seven. One two three four five six seven.
[5079.77s -> 5086.65s]  One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen. One two
[5086.65s -> 5122.17s]  three four five six seven. One two three four five six seven. Got it. I'm gonna have like a big display
[5122.17s -> 5144.09s]  here. That's gonna be another section of the park over this way and over here. You can find it. Get back
[5144.09s -> 5162.82s]  over here. You know what are you doing? You can't be that stupid. Open it. There we go. I gotta put
[5162.82s -> 5171.06s]  some distraction. How much money do I have? Make this more expensive. Forty dollars to get in this
[5171.06s -> 5181.29s]  fucking park. We have to see what they think. Already getting loaded up. Is it too intense?
[5181.29s -> 5196.17s]  No people are getting on. I caught that sneeze. Just barely. It's too intense. Just looking at
[5196.17s -> 5215.54s]  just barely makes me feel sick. People are getting on. Here we go. Whoa that was intense.
[5219.32s -> 5243.67s]  I need the bark bags out here. Click on the main gates. What about it? Park rating. Look at this
[5243.67s -> 5259.74s]  park rating. People love this place. All right looking good. Now I need to get some money. I
[5259.74s -> 5275.18s]  have to make money. Let's increase some scenery over here because this looks terrible. Fences.
[5275.98s -> 5285.72s]  Let's get a fence. Let's do this fence. This is a big fence. Looks good to me.
[5287.40s -> 5304.20s]  And then I'm gonna put. Let's close off this area. Roto drop is now available. Let's go. Let's make
[5304.20s -> 5328.49s]  like a little nice garden for people to puke on. Put on the new leaf soundtrack in due time.
[5332.70s -> 5336.54s]  Okay that looks all right. Now let's get some bushes and trees and bushes.
[5337.90s -> 5351.83s]  Maybe let's just do flowers. I'm just gonna do purple. Yeah watch this. Groups of three. One two three.
[5352.79s -> 5363.21s]  And then I'm gonna do space space. Yes space space and then three spaces. Yellow I guess.
[5363.85s -> 5399.08s]  I'm gonna do the same thing. Space space and then space right there. We're gonna go. All right now
[5399.16s -> 5412.50s]  I'm gonna do. Um how do these look? These are like evil. I don't want those. Uh how about
[5413.62s -> 5423.69s]  how about these? No bushes. There we are. That's what I want. I want these fluffy ones.
[5434.86s -> 5442.46s]  No I want like a tree. There we go. These. That's what I'm that's what I was looking for.
[5443.42s -> 5464.76s]  Okay now I'm gonna do the same thing over here. I'm gonna add a couple things in here though.
[5465.40s -> 5485.54s]  I fucked it up. Wrong. What do you mean wrong? I fucked it up. Wrong wrong wrong. How is it wrong?
[5492.78s -> 5497.18s]  Space space. Oh right. Okay hold on. Let me. I'm gonna change it up though. Let's change it up.
[5497.18s -> 5506.95s]  Let's do red and let's do pink and um let's do pink and red. Let's do pink over here. I don't know.
[5517.06s -> 5520.90s]  Keep it symmetrical. Didn't people scream in my face when I did symmetrical?
[5520.98s -> 5535.88s]  Just barely broke down. Lined up to do this. What do you mean it broke down? Where? I had people
[5535.88s -> 5540.04s]  screaming in my face because I was doing a symmetrical garden and now all of a sudden
[5540.04s -> 5559.51s]  you want a symmetrical garden? One two three one two. What is this? Is that a corona trigger?
[5560.31s -> 5596.44s]  Space space space. Nice. That's. See now I did it. I don't like the way this looks though.
[5597.16s -> 5618.87s]  What's going on here? What happened? Why? This looks completely wrong.
[5619.67s -> 5639.94s]  Oh it's because they're in the middle. They're in the middle. Okay. Now we're gonna do a little
[5640.82s -> 5675.99s]  thing in the middle I think is what I want to do. Just a little thing. Small. A duck in one of them?
[5675.99s -> 5696.58s]  Yeah. The duck at the end. Two ducks. Double no. Double duck through the whole thing. That looks
[5696.66s -> 5711.24s]  great. I like it. All right. That makes it look a little better I think. Maybe we should have like
[5711.24s -> 5723.78s]  a statue or something. Double wall. Is this Abe Lincoln? Who's this? What is that? Oh it's Egyptian.
[5724.74s -> 5730.92s]  Bump it a bump. It broke down. All right. Do I have enough money? I only have $522. How did
[5730.92s -> 5757.85s]  that happen? Where did my money go? New benches. People can enjoy sitting around here and that's
[5757.85s -> 5769.48s]  we're gonna put some soda machine over here. I think that works. Ice cold drinks. Ice cold
[5769.48s -> 5775.69s]  pretzels. What are you doing? If they take a double water fountain I'll just sell these and
[5775.69s -> 5782.31s]  put them over here. Now I need like a I need ice cold first aid. There's my information center.
[5782.31s -> 5797.46s]  How much are these? All right. Where's this? This is the drinks. Hot dog. Chicken. There it is.
[5798.10s -> 5801.78s]  The park has received an award for being the safest park in the country.
[5805.93s -> 5807.93s]  Oh it's it's slider.
[5820.73s -> 5827.13s]  You know KK Slaughter to me is what I would think it would sound like if a bug sang.
[5828.49s -> 5831.85s]  Imagine you just heard this muffled through the wall and you went in there was like a
[5831.85s -> 5845.64s]  beetle just swaying back and forth. That's what I picture. Drinks and we'll do food over here.
[5847.72s -> 5851.08s]  Hot dogs. Yeah hot dogs and just a couple of drinks.
[5863.66s -> 5899.18s]  KK Slaughter's been the most modern pop music. Oh shit a bug. So uh chicken too. I'm gonna go
[5900.14s -> 5919.00s]  let me I need a first aid room. I really do. Should I put it though? I don't I don't like
[5919.00s -> 5924.22s]  this the symmetry over here. First aid should probably be on the in front of the rides of the
[5924.22s -> 5945.03s]  most dangerous. What do you guys think? Yeah let's put it over here. First is first aid free? I guess
[5945.03s -> 5955.86s]  yeah. It's just available in case somebody pukes. Imagine going to a roller coaster and right outside
[5955.86s -> 5968.01s]  the entrance is a medical tent. Yeah that's actually pretty scary. F wheels broken down.
[5968.01s -> 5973.78s]  Uh oh. Is it time to liquidate this thing? This is not even the right color scheme.
[5974.50s -> 6002.52s]  What am I thinking? All right I wanted the fountains over here. Can I get it? Can I pick it up?
[6003.56s -> 6016.26s]  No it's just it's in a weird spot. Why did I put these here? Got it all right. Can I get the other
[6016.26s -> 6026.09s]  one? I'm pretty slick. People really like the ice cube. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[6026.09s -> 6032.41s]  wait. Put more benches here. What an attraction. Everybody was supposed to sit in front of the ice
[6032.41s -> 6044.33s]  cube. All right look it. You got at least two, four, five, six people here. Should I do a second cube?
[6050.44s -> 6062.84s]  Why not? That's 25 bucks. All right I wanted to put fountains here. Here and here maybe.
[6063.64s -> 6073.86s]  The tornado is a little distracting. Oh I like that. That's nice. What could this go?
[6135.18s -> 6137.66s]  That's actually I kind of I like it.
[6142.22s -> 6176.22s]  Didn't go all the way. Oops. No my garden. No that's fine. What's this bug?
[6177.10s -> 6184.06s]  Volcano? We're gonna have some cool. We have to have things that they go by, right? What are these?
[6184.06s -> 6230.89s]  Are these fireworks? Okay. I need to stop spending money. Put on some music. Okay.
[6231.53s -> 6245.64s]  Which I put on. I need some rain. I know. Come on. When's it gonna rain? Mario 3D world.
[6256.52s -> 6269.77s]  3D world. Don't I hate this game? Which is the one that I don't like? Mario. Super Mario 3D world LST.
[6270.33s -> 6288.14s]  Oh this is bopping. Okay so how are we doing? Let's take a look at the. Let's get a good view
[6288.14s -> 6295.58s]  of what's going on here. I've been queuing for Luigi's Circuit for ages. I need more cars.
[6296.38s -> 6304.02s]  I gotta. I need more cars. I gotta close this down because people look. Look at this. Everyone hates
[6304.02s -> 6320.79s]  this. I need to go to the bathroom. What do you mean? This bathroom? That's 10 cents right? I have
[6320.79s -> 6334.01s]  to go to the bathroom. I have to go to the bathroom. Uh I guess I'm gonna make some more bathrooms.
[6334.01s -> 6357.54s]  Are they just standing in line? That's their problem? I'm not hungry. I've already got a cuddly toy.
[6358.34s -> 6368.97s]  This park is really clean. I'm not thirsty. Whoops daisy. Whoops daisy was great.
[6369.93s -> 6378.41s]  Okay so Luigi's Circuit is taking too long. I'm gonna make the. I'm sorry. I have to do this.
[6378.41s -> 6383.45s]  It's gonna be bad but I have to do it. Ladies and gentlemen Luigi's Circuit is now closed
[6385.69s -> 6464.68s]  for maintenance. I'm gonna add a couple of cars here. Bingo. Six cars. How long is the ride?
[6467.21s -> 6474.57s]  Max leave if another train arrives at the station. Wait for. Okay I think we're good. We've got more
[6474.57s -> 6487.62s]  cars. I think that's good. I think it's good to go. Open it up. It's back open. We've got three
[6487.62s -> 6520.01s]  extra cars. What do you mean music? This is uh guys this is. What song is this? I don't know.
[6520.57s -> 6532.12s]  This isn't even closed. What? I don't know what this is. This is called Super Mario World OST Extended.
[6532.92s -> 6554.10s]  How about Beat Block Skyway? That's next in line. It's the same song. Hold on. Wait what's wrong?
[6554.10s -> 6561.46s]  Why people not going on the ride? Is this going faster? What's going on? People don't want to
[6561.46s -> 6573.58s]  get on this ride anymore. Why not? I don't. Why you guys think I know what like a porn song is?
[6573.58s -> 6590.06s]  It's Mario 3D World. What are you talking about? Okay um what's what is a what's a what's a
[6590.06s -> 6649.70s]  relaxing one? Stardew? How about Dune? That sounds pretty good. Okay uh I want to build another
[6649.70s -> 6659.70s]  coaster but I don't have any money. Should I make a fourth one of these? No. No one's even riding it.
[6663.27s -> 6674.30s]  There we go. Now let people in line. Take out a loan. I hate doing that. I really hate taking out
[6674.30s -> 6703.70s]  loans. Um I'm actually I'm in I'm not in the red loan. I can't. I gotta wait. This is freaking
[6703.70s -> 6721.91s]  me out. I don't want something. I'm putting on fucking Mario RPG. There we go. Guests are
[6721.91s -> 6733.43s]  complaining about the disgusting state of the park. What are you talking about? Where? I don't know
[6733.43s -> 6743.80s]  what you mean by that. Okay now I want to put the game sounds back up a little because I like to
[6743.80s -> 6759.58s]  hear like a little. That's a nice level. People are not shitting. All right there's plenty of
[6759.58s -> 6770.15s]  bathrooms. I need another janitor. Oh it's this. All right what did not there's a janitor that's
[6770.15s -> 6788.89s]  doing this isn't there? Where are you? Who's the one that has the path? It's you. What's your path?
[6789.77s -> 6792.17s]  Oh well add this to your path.
[6792.17s -> 6824.18s]  This game is so good. If the guy doesn't have a path. Yeah he can just wander. All right you take
[6824.18s -> 6833.69s]  care of that like the front end here. Are you still just what does that egg mean? Walking to egg?
[6833.69s -> 6840.73s]  Oh no no no he's an astronaut. Right okay. I think it's time to change to a panda.
[6841.69s -> 6858.52s]  It looks good. There we go. Clean it up. Make it look nicer. Would I ever stream it? I've
[6858.52s -> 6864.15s]  I've beat this game probably like 40 times. I don't know if I'd be able to add very much
[6865.11s -> 6873.75s]  but I have we've talked about before. Who cares? Just kind of do it. All right. All right well hold
[6873.75s -> 6881.16s]  on. I need to do it. I need some. I got 2400 bucks. Can I fast forward time? You can do this?
[6881.96s -> 6894.01s]  Try to just do this really fast and until I can build a new coaster? Because I want to build a
[6894.01s -> 6902.26s]  giant one. It's time for the monorail. I think it's time. Can you imagine? I was going to go
[6902.26s -> 6912.70s]  around this whole thing with the monorail. It's time. Monorail. Or how about a choo-choo train?
[6913.34s -> 6933.77s]  Elevator? It's got to be back. The path. There's going to be a path that leads down here
[6935.13s -> 6943.21s]  to somewhere over here. And we go around this whole thing. I don't have to finish the whole
[6943.21s -> 6958.78s]  thing right now. Yeah this is the best soundtrack for any Mario game. Well I will hold that up.
[6958.78s -> 6969.67s]  Track to track to any Mario game you've ever played. All right let's go back here. Now let's
[6969.67s -> 6983.40s]  go up. Up, up, up, up, up. Up, up, up, up. Good. Wait. Okay. So they get a good view.
[6985.08s -> 7008.89s]  No that's not necessary. Just go around the whole thing. Here's the intro. Go around. I'm
[7008.89s -> 7029.83s]  almost out of money. I don't have to finish it yet. I can wait. It's just this is like I'm
[7029.83s -> 7048.55s]  making like a prison. Fuck negative 44. What do I do? Delete? No I'm gonna wait. Just wait.
[7049.35s -> 7089.77s]  There we go. Okay positive again. This is gonna be cool. Ready? Watch this.
[7090.49s -> 7123.24s]  Don't pack it up. Really? Come on. I thought I could do this. I gotta go back. It's gotta go
[7123.24s -> 7144.23s]  across this way. Is that too low? That's not too low right? Is that too low? That's not too low?
[7145.72s -> 7148.28s]  Oh it's if you stand up.
[7151.69s -> 7161.45s]  Okay it's fine. It's not too low. We're good. Straight ahead. I might have to change that a
[7161.45s -> 7205.56s]  little. No. Ugly. Ugly. Is it where Toad explains you how to play the game? Tutorial Toad comes in.
[7229.77s -> 7265.50s]  Damn it. Do a Toad impression. Got it. Monorail is done. Retro style. Yeah. No that's ugly. Four
[7265.50s -> 7272.58s]  trains. Five cars per train. What does that mean? Continuous shuttle mode? What a shuttle mode.
[7275.99s -> 7280.39s]  Reliability. All right. This is we gotta change this. This is gonna be orange. We got too much
[7280.39s -> 7303.43s]  blue. Like orange. We're gonna make this like a little like a gray. No. That's better. Less
[7303.43s -> 7312.46s]  assuming. Station style wood. No. Something something new. Something something daring.
[7312.46s -> 7318.54s]  There we go. Pretzels. All vehicles of the same color. We're gonna make these orange and

[10536.94s -> 10571.21s]  fuck is happening i mean i can see you guys typing to charge my internet card oh shit uh it says i'm
[10571.21s -> 10589.00s]  still this is freaking me out yeah you guys can just hear me uh uh yeah can you see my mouse
[10589.00s -> 10603.86s]  moving you can hear but not see yeah i'm looking over here it's like going all over the place
[10603.86s -> 10616.92s]  guys strange yeah i paused again mouse is moving what's the this is really weird hold on time for
[10616.92s -> 10627.99s]  a telephone stream uh no it's not the game it's the something going on with i don't it's not even
[10627.99s -> 10637.14s]  like my internet it's weird it looks like it's my internet but it's not my internet let me do
[10637.14s -> 10651.90s]  something here yeah the game is paused but that doesn't matter one sec this is fucked up because
[10651.90s -> 10661.91s]  over on my obs i'm like red like completely in the red so don't ask me why this is happening
[10668.10s -> 10672.95s]  well i'm definitely still dropping frames because here like if i'm positive it'll probably happen
[10674.15s -> 10688.26s]  yeah see let me it's very stuttery yeah it's all looks like it's all screwed up
[10689.14s -> 10696.34s]  give me one second let me i'm gonna try something give me one second the stream might die but it
[10696.34s -> 10780.02s]  might come right hello are we still are we still bad uh yeah this is weird this shouldn't be
[10780.02s -> 10795.61s]  happening they just fixed it they just fixed it and the same thing is happening again yeah this
[10795.61s -> 10801.05s]  this is legit the same problem from three days ago i'm dropping like 70 percent of all frame
[10801.77s -> 10812.31s]  this is this is just fucking bananas people the people on like the engineering team actually even
[10812.31s -> 10819.99s]  like fix it in the back end something really fucked up is going on somebody is killing this
[10819.99s -> 10827.32s]  node i have no idea what's going on but like like this is how fucked up this is right this is the
[10827.32s -> 10836.76s]  last three days shit's been almost perfect we that's i think i dropped like 100 frames last
[10836.76s -> 10843.03s]  night in like eight hours and it was perfect it was perfect we got perfect for five hours straight
[10843.67s -> 10847.11s]  so what the hell's going on you know i'm saying like somebody's fucking dumping us
[10847.91s -> 10870.44s]  i'm gonna i'm gonna wait i'm gonna sit here for like a minute or two i just want to build my mouse
[10870.44s -> 10892.90s]  roller coaster are we good are we here is this is it fine what the hell is going on what the fuck
[10892.90s -> 10902.78s]  it's back to normal now for now is somebody like pissing on like the electrical outlet next to the
[10902.78s -> 10913.70s]  node that's a bit what i like to make no sense what in the name of god it's it's fixed it's back
[10913.70s -> 10919.46s]  to normal that was just like four straight minutes of just dead internet what in the name of god
[10919.46s -> 10930.54s]  all right well whatever let's keep what i need to test this all right okay welcome back everybody
[10930.54s -> 10936.39s]  hopefully uh hopefully we're still good here for a while all right so what was it okay i was
[10936.39s -> 10943.90s]  testing this again my mouse my my new mouse coaster where is it close it and open it back up
[10945.70s -> 10964.58s]  test why can i not test it why can i not test the coaster is it because it crashed can i never open
[10964.58s -> 10976.25s]  this ever again no i don't want to open it i want to test it nobody's in the cube yeah i know
[10978.36s -> 10988.84s]  it's because it crashed you need to repair it let me go through and find out where it would
[10988.84s -> 10995.43s]  uh crash again let's see so it looks like here it goes i fixed that one so it's gonna go down
[10995.43s -> 11003.19s]  wrap around then go up i think it'll make it up that down catch up caught i think it'll be fine
[11003.19s -> 11030.01s]  though okay let's try it again here we go all right come on work work work work work work
[11030.89s -> 11045.72s]  there we go first drop passes by over here chain added all right we haven't seen this before
[11046.52s -> 11066.46s]  it goes around down and around come on keep going delete delete delete delete delete delete
[11066.46s -> 11071.74s]  delete delete delete delete delete it stop stop stop stop stop okay so right here i need a chain
[11071.74s -> 11089.19s]  here like right here so like right here needs to be a chain right i think that makes sense
[11097.14s -> 11116.71s]  that simulate the ride oh that's helpful i didn't even know that was possible delete delete delete
[11116.71s -> 11127.50s]  delete delete delete so it'll get caught there slowly fall over here and then that should be it
[11128.22s -> 11151.86s]  there it goes and around no it's got to be this one here damn it this is bad i'm gonna have to
[11151.86s -> 11166.25s]  change this whole thing here it's got to be straight like this on the chain on the chain
[11169.24s -> 11183.16s]  chain turn it turn it hard turn it hard and that's it right there oh what how was that
[11183.16s -> 11192.14s]  possible what did i do i screwed that up bad that's not it right there damn it look at that
[11192.14s -> 11242.65s]  looks perfect i think i have to do it from here straighten it out chain on straight bang a no
[11242.65s -> 11251.29s]  straight again turn turn straight and then here i need to get over here
[11252.25s -> 11263.21s]  i need to get rid of this how do i get on the other side i want to like get over this way but
[11263.21s -> 11281.37s]  i can't get over there i really have to go all the way around all right that should help
[11282.17s -> 11347.67s]  shit did it no i need to turn the camera what the hell okay no it needs to be down and over
[11347.67s -> 11385.35s]  i just want to see what it looked like oh you son of a gun look at the poles go back it up then
[11385.99s -> 11415.88s]  not quite a little bit over i can't even see it damn it i had it done where even is this
[11422.68s -> 11451.99s]  shit i'm gonna fucking puke on camera is that not it what oh my god
[11454.23s -> 11489.85s]  shit no it's too much going on here it's impossible to see this is in the way change this color okay
[11489.85s -> 11510.34s]  um i'm just going up and we're gonna meet in the middle it's got a half thing on it okay meet me in

[11926.78s -> 11954.44s]  whole way and then turn it like right here i don't i don't even know what's going on
[11956.04s -> 12041.19s]  okay i need to slow down but why is this pre-recorded pre-recorded how it took him
[12041.19s -> 12051.16s]  that long what do you i need to see this with different set eyes because this shit is fucked up
[12053.56s -> 12071.69s]  guess they're complaining about the amount of trash i'm not sure which way to look at this place
[12072.65s -> 12083.32s]  he's pretending to be bad well no i actually this was going pretty smoothly until uh i built
[12083.32s -> 12088.52s]  the second one of these that's when it went off and then i just tried to see how many things i
[12088.52s -> 12092.28s]  could get in the same spot actually you know i'll be honest i think i did a pretty good job
[12093.64s -> 12104.01s]  let's put another one i mean nobody said that pathway exit to luigi's
[12104.81s -> 12127.69s]  uh wait did he just did he just pick up throw up this guy right here
[12132.44s -> 12138.12s]  and throwing up this ride's not even that intense this ride's stupid
[12150.89s -> 12157.50s]  there's so much throw up there which one of these is closed it's broken down where are my mechanics
[12159.88s -> 12175.43s]  get another one there are almost a thousand people in this park just looking at the big
[12175.43s -> 12201.38s]  tree makes me feel sick no one's getting in the big tree line anymore i know what to do cut the
[12201.38s -> 12221.61s]  tree down no now i just wait and make money and i'm yes i'm looking over here because it hurts my
[12221.61s -> 12231.40s]  eyes to see the other stuff you're right okay so now we're gonna go uh i steal wild mouse one needs
[12231.40s -> 12253.24s]  a new name the weeds so yeah into the weeds the big tree these need to be changed no there
[12253.24s -> 12293.30s]  shouldn't be blue anymore doesn't fit the theme gosh your slushy broke down it's all right i want
[12293.30s -> 12303.86s]  a cool water ride now i'm sick of looking at this i can't even click in here what's going on over

[12364.20s -> 12369.16s]  because they see somebody playing roller coaster tycoon 2 and this is what they see and they just
[12370.97s -> 12382.47s]  shake their head a few times and then ask how did he even manage to do this well you're gonna
[12382.47s -> 12393.70s]  have more questions because there's another one coming in this way you'll have way more questions
[12393.70s -> 12400.17s]  just gotta wait till i get a few more dollars i'm making money though i could just relax i'm
[12400.17s -> 12409.91s]  gonna increase the price 45 bucks what do i need a thousand guests i want a water ride too though
[12410.55s -> 12418.42s]  all right i'm gonna do a uh do i have log flume dini slide log flume all right yeah i do that's
[12418.42s -> 12428.14s]  already what it's what i have over there splash boats that's what this is log flume that's really
[12428.14s -> 12445.46s]  cool how does this tree relate suspended swinging coaster a giga coaster they can go up to 300 feet

[12510.84s -> 12534.17s]  this is gonna be the end i can already tell you how do i turn off the emote only all right i have
[12534.17s -> 12569.48s]  36 000 giga coaster i can't can i actually put it right here no i can't this thing is gonna be
[12569.48s -> 12693.64s]  fucking insane slow down i'm fine hit the brakes hit the brakes oh my god that shouldn't even be
[12693.64s -> 12766.66s]  real i don't even money this is seriously like have i just given up completely on this
[12769.42s -> 12876.39s]  you're not gonna be able to tell what the fuck is going on what's up oh right hi i yeah i forgot
[12876.39s -> 12886.18s]  i forgot i was live it happens that was the best of us yeah i'm streaming you're right yeah yeah hey
[12886.18s -> 12902.92s]  i how many i forgot like four times now i just spaced the fuck out yeah i did i really did it was
[12902.92s -> 12909.34s]  like a hard space too i need uh entrance the entrance look at these i don't have to do anything
[12909.34s -> 12912.06s]  crazy for the entrance and exit here all right let's see will this do it what is this gonna do
[12913.10s -> 12958.49s]  where is it what is it doing what is it doing up here this is not this is not the brake part
[12958.49s -> 12989.58s]  the game was not paused yoshi yoshi commits tax fraud ost all right what happened what's going
[12989.58s -> 13002.18s]  on here are these not let me see here hold on it's the chain right so chain chain the chain is still
[13002.18s -> 13010.39s]  on we're gonna we're gonna turn and then close it so what happened there what's the problem
[13011.19s -> 13038.63s]  i don't understand what are you doing why is it stuck chain adds act as a block brake i thought
[13038.71s -> 13053.45s]  the chain pulls it up the isn't the chain supposed to pull it up you need block brake when you have
[13053.45s -> 13075.98s]  two trains there's a train stuck further along wait hold on the way this is what you're talking
[13075.98s -> 13106.17s]  about okay so i have to go over here and take these brakes out here the boosters aren't fat
[13106.25s -> 13112.46s]  they're 170 miles per hour what do you mean they're not fast enough okay here's boost
[13114.47s -> 13123.38s]  so right here is where it needs to go out so let's go like this i need to get rid of these
[13123.38s -> 13135.69s]  i think these are all brakes right boost boost boost boost boost boost done faster i can't go
[13135.69s -> 13143.02s]  faster that's not gonna happen all right turn it on we're good all right we're good let's try it
[13143.02s -> 13203.06s]  again multiple weeks this is like taking a trip to the moon it took weeks to get and it takes
[13203.06s -> 13232.15s]  weeks to get down oh my god that would be horrible holy shit i can't believe it didn't crash
[13232.95s -> 13247.34s]  these people yeah these people would be liquefied max speed 120 miles per hour
[13256.23s -> 13270.06s]  let's see the let's see the g's vertical g's like skull cracks let's see
[13291.19s -> 13295.67s]  your stomach goes into the fucking back of your throat
[13295.67s -> 13336.63s]  oh my god all right it works open for business i wonder if anyone will get on this i love how
[13336.63s -> 13350.98s]  this is parallel to the monorail this thing's gonna go by so fast this is gonna blow other
[13350.98s -> 13366.52s]  stuff over no one's gonna ride this i still i got 13 grams still all right it's still
[13367.40s -> 13376.84s]  3d cinema has done what it's all right so what about a scenario where i change this
[13378.50s -> 13388.23s]  and i make it go all the way down here slow drops slow drops and just make a gigantic snake
[13391.00s -> 13396.46s]  and you actually are on the ride for like two or three months what's my park rating
[13396.46s -> 13406.15s]  people are left people left sorry yeah i got too concentrated over here i this was starting to be
[13406.15s -> 13423.91s]  all right and then i just just this happened and i i lost control completely hold on let me do
[13423.91s -> 13427.99s]  something over here let me at least spread this out a little bit so it's not like concentrated
[13428.63s -> 13433.67s]  nonsense all right how about i want to do an actual cool roller coaster one that i actually
[13433.67s -> 13441.70s]  would be proud of bobsled coaster that's pretty cool that's really cool i want to i want to make
[13441.70s -> 13461.45s]  one a bobsled coaster all right let's make this for real let's say what can i do on ride photo
[13461.45s -> 13476.81s]  okay let's go up let's go let's get let's go up this way they're already 20 bucks
[13481.45s -> 13494.34s]  just gently go up like that okay not too anything nothing too ridiculous at first
[13494.34s -> 13505.58s]  let's just go up a little bit like this drop that bend it to the maybe maybe give it a nice turn
[13505.58s -> 13534.34s]  here i want a big cup all right interesting charge higher for umbrellas i can't there
[13535.22s -> 13543.74s]  and then i want it to go up again so that's it this is the first little bit of an oops
[13543.74s -> 13551.58s]  you know like up bend it this way check this out ready so make it a little bit of a of a
[13551.58s -> 13580.58s]  tilt scenario like this come on you can do it come on okay bend it again a little
[13583.32s -> 13589.24s]  now we're going to go on part two here part two is chain i think that's enough speed it might not
[13589.24s -> 13603.50s]  move i hope it is up up again higher that's all right right there's fine it looks good now let's
[13603.50s -> 13636.73s]  really bend that twist it down i ran out of money that's good enough and then bring it down
[13637.69s -> 13648.49s]  let's bend it over this way i think i can go up can i go up and over yeah i should be able to turn
[13648.49s -> 13660.49s]  it one more time i got five grand still those things are so expensive bank it again straighten
[13660.49s -> 13675.30s]  it out down we're going to wrap it back this way one more time slow it up come in for the close
[13676.02s -> 13694.10s]  go down with it this way harder right there drop it at the very end connected all right
[13697.02s -> 13698.94s]  and i'm putting i'm putting like a statue up here
[13709.77s -> 13732.33s]  test it how does it work i like the little pretzel here
[13733.69s -> 13750.01s]  how are you guys getting a dick out of this this if this is a dick then i don't that would be
[13750.09s -> 13760.66s]  uh an issue i think i would that were never mind all right it made it around the first pretzel
[13761.38s -> 13811.30s]  come on what kind of dick this listen that is not a dick it's if anything oh
[13813.53s -> 13821.29s]  all right so i had trouble i need to make this a little smaller let's go this way with it
[13822.33s -> 13830.81s]  i'm gonna say um i'm gonna say um so over here this needs to be straightened out
[13831.53s -> 13845.53s]  so we're gonna go forward with it wait i think i can go like this
[13846.41s -> 13861.75s]  it should do it all right get over that first hump just then i can go up this chain here there's
[13861.75s -> 13870.94s]  no way it's gonna go up this this has to be a chain as well no way not gonna happen you know
[13871.02s -> 13895.54s]  i mean you know what i'm saying you know what i mean this has to be a chain this whole thing
[13895.54s -> 13920.07s]  is just gonna go away and then down what's the size on this guy 40 feet 40 feet i got it right
[13920.07s -> 13930.68s]  there tighter 40 feet 40 feet straight ahead how's that 40 feet that's not even 40 feet what are you
[13930.68s -> 13940.62s]  talking about it's not 40 feet that's not 40 feet how's that 40 feet that's not 40 feet what's
[13940.62s -> 13972.73s]  going on there that's not 40 feet that's bullshit double click what does that do
[13973.45s -> 13993.45s]  damn money is that it is it going in there all right does that does that work does that help me
[13993.45s -> 14093.22s]  out there i think it does ladies and gentlemen tested i'm sorry i forgot i was streaming is that
[14093.22s -> 14116.14s]  but from this angle it's also incorrect did i just get it what is happening 50 50 feet just go
[14116.14s -> 14124.63s]  forward 50 50 straight ahead you've done it you've done it now you can play the game now son
[14125.98s -> 14164.54s]  thanks dad please cost end this unholy stream why would you ever want that to happen what happened
[14164.54s -> 14177.22s]  you you've failed your objective oh whatever i don't care look at how slow this is it's not
[14177.22s -> 14181.22s]  going to be enough this has to be a chain or something this is so slow it's not going to
[14181.22s -> 14190.52s]  happen i gotta just delete these makings chain is this little oomph gonna be enough
[14191.24s -> 14263.80s]  open it i don't care come on now people are gonna be fine there's no there's nothing there's no
[14263.80s -> 14272.50s]  enclosed thing that's good can i define momentum when you go uh when you're going forward at a
[14272.50s -> 14281.38s]  certain speed and when you're the way to slow yourself down you're going your weight is pushing
[14281.38s -> 14292.38s]  forward so there's you have that extra you know um i can't talk right now it's forward motion
[14293.18s -> 14298.38s]  and the momentum is like your weight combined with how fast you're moving forward and then if
[14298.38s -> 14301.98s]  there's no more engine running you turn the engine off and you're still going forward you're still
[14301.98s -> 14322.44s]  going to move forward because you have momentum oh he's leaving us in the realm i just wanted to
[14322.44s -> 14332.92s]  work uh this is my fifth year running this place this has been a nostalgia trip though it really
[14332.92s -> 14349.03s]  has i'm doing this same exact shit is anybody even riding this see this is fun you go around
[14349.03s -> 14358.09s]  one two then you go to the drop yeah this is a fun coaster this is not like broken or bad i
[14358.09s -> 14364.14s]  screwed up or anything i mean people people have you all you know you killed somebody no i didn't
[14392.49s -> 14398.71s]  this person's still in line do you really want to go on this
[14401.29s -> 14406.42s]  you sure that you want to go on this ride you really i just want to make sure you're aware
[14406.42s -> 14434.20s]  of what happens when you're on this i can't even whatever at the very very very end
[14452.87s -> 14472.94s]  why would it explode here of all the places here look how slow this goes too much wiggle at the end
[14513.46s -> 14518.18s]  no i got it wrong make more of the dinosaur statues you know that's not a bad idea
[14575.56s -> 14580.36s]  okay i have so much trouble with this i've roller coaster tycoon 3 you just hit the auto
[14580.36s -> 14583.40s]  button and it does it i didn't i didn't play this one as much as i played three
[14625.61s -> 14647.50s]  i'm gonna fucking lose my mind this is like doing a three-point turn in like a parking lot
[14648.14s -> 14753.00s]  it's like parallel parking a car end of sanity no i'm fine although i'm probably gonna stop
[14753.00s -> 14767.13s]  streaming soon though it's getting late all right somebody get on it it's safe i promise
[14767.93s -> 14792.36s]  what's the problem why does nobody want to ride it what's the issue you made it around good up
[14793.22s -> 14798.18s]  around goes all the way around comes over here and that's it is the engineer gonna ride it
[14810.36s -> 14822.09s]  it goes slower than the people are walking temporarily ride sucks lol true did you just
[14823.05s -> 14825.13s]  do two comments answering your own thing
[14838.36s -> 14846.31s]  here we go cool bends on the bobsled somebody waiting in line it is safe plenty of time for
[14846.31s -> 14862.60s]  this to slow down around a little bend done it's safe to ride get on welcome oh ride sucks yeah
[14862.60s -> 14884.63s]  true true oh my god this thing this is off this is right off
[14902.33s -> 14909.66s]  all right it's been fun i think i'm done streaming for today why does your theme park
[14910.46s -> 14918.25s]  why does your theme park look like the cables behind my tv well that's a great question viewer
[14919.54s -> 14934.17s]  the answer is not so simple nobody riding the tree either why is it closed no
[14934.49s -> 14938.57s]  there's a ride back here that's been closed the whole time where are my rides where's my ride
[14938.57s -> 14957.22s]  overlay now the duality of chat i'm hungry i'm not hungry it's not closed it's just unpopular no
[14957.22s -> 14969.48s]  it's closed where is my list where's my list broken down the big tree i just saw it move up
[14969.48s -> 15001.66s]  and down what are you talking about how is it broken down all right it's open people like this
[15001.66s -> 15009.82s]  one and you guys said this is a shitty coaster look at how wrong that was we already got a line
[15009.82s -> 15032.86s]  out the door this is like one of the biggest coasters in the park that's fun i need to do go
[15032.86s -> 15045.94s]  carts all right that's the last thing i'm gonna do i'm at my maximum there's go carts there it is
[15045.94s -> 15197.51s]  go carts let's go and let's seal it up is this the where is it it's like where's waldo i have no idea
[15197.51s -> 15224.20s]  where it is uh never have any idea next to the ferris wheel no no i'm saying where's the thing
[15224.20s -> 15235.26s]  to end it it's like over here right i can't even see it that far so it's over here right in there
[15236.14s -> 15255.85s]  right there i'm gonna run out of money yeah this this is my official who gives a shit
[15256.81s -> 15275.11s]  i had a lot of fun though this game's a blast it always is all right almost out of money and then

[15545.27s -> 15550.39s]  lot of fun i had i actually had a really good time this was a fun game up until uh the last
[15550.39s -> 15559.02s]  probably 45 minutes to an hour when i just uh i just lost my mind why is my rating so bad
[15559.02s -> 15564.14s]  because i started to do this and i also just like 10 people just drowned
[15574.92s -> 15583.37s]  oh this is so funny what a fun game but that's gonna be it for me we're gonna do the bits

[15636.54s -> 15645.35s]  twitch integration to work but sadly they shut it down like last year so i'm gonna look into
[15645.35s -> 15653.91s]  having a server because what happens is people in chat are people in the game every single person
[15653.91s -> 15660.06s]  in here is somebody from chat is how that integration works that would be really fun
[15660.86s -> 15672.01s]  and i would play this again if i could get that to work but i do need to set up my own server
[15672.01s -> 15685.85s]  which i kind of have to figure that out but uh in the meantime i'm gonna call it here we're
[15685.85s -> 15695.59s]  gonna do the bits and i will see you guys in a couple days today is wednesday i will see you guys

[15714.39s -> 15727.10s]  it anyways we're gonna do connect i have just under 30 40 connect games ranging from ones that
[15727.10s -> 15733.03s]  are probably fun to ones that are probably be played for about eight minutes and then

[15746.78s -> 15756.68s]  idea of a game i i have it i went through meticulously and purchased every single connect
[15756.68s -> 15762.44s]  game that i thought would be even remotely interesting on stream there's 40 of them
[15764.76s -> 15774.95s]  almost every single one we are going to do that for saturday and sunday i don't know how long
[15774.95s -> 15782.30s]  that's going to take us i don't know exactly how far we'll get through them we may need to add

[16167.40s -> 16173.42s]  250 hey germa i worked a teenage job this past summer in an ice cream shop which means i've
[16173.42s -> 16178.06s]  earned enough to tell you how much i appreciate your streams vodz highlights in you i know it's
[16178.06s -> 16183.18s]  hard to appreciate your viewers due to their incomprehensible scale but i want you to know
[16183.18s -> 16187.82s]  you make one 16-year-old rhode islanders life a lot better with your work good luck to you for
[16187.82s -> 16194.60s]  your first full year in vegas and good luck to me for junior year in high school good luck to you
[16199.69s -> 16215.27s]  new england i miss it all the time but good luck thank you amazing sponge for the 250
[16219.32s -> 16227.06s]  and as the channel grows i do i never want to lose that aspect of
[16228.60s -> 16236.22s]  people just becoming numbers it can be hard sometimes to essentially let's say you do this
[16236.22s -> 16245.58s]  in this you know two three four five thousand people here it's hard to individualize everybody
[16245.58s -> 16253.13s]  but i don't really i don't want to have that scenario where people adjust numbers it just i
[16253.13s -> 16271.51s]  don't know it freaks me out a little but then on the other hand right it's it's sometimes it can
[16271.51s -> 16278.78s]  kind of be overwhelming sometimes if you think about it not this kind of thing but just trying
[16278.78s -> 16289.80s]  to go over in my head the just how many people might may or may not be here but over the years
[16289.80s -> 16295.32s]  i've it if there's five thousand ten thousand five hundred thousand people here i would be
[16295.32s -> 16301.48s]  i would act the same i wouldn't really change anything i feel like i haven't really done i
[16301.48s -> 16306.84s]  haven't really changed who i am as a person i don't think since starting this i think i've
[16306.84s -> 16323.85s]  been pretty much the same as i was from 100 views on a youtube video to people watching this maybe
[16323.85s -> 16329.67s]  i have maybe a little not that i've been able to see and look in the mirror and go you've changed
[16330.23s -> 16334.31s]  i don't know maybe that's the talk of the villain that is changing i don't
[16337.02s -> 16342.73s]  but thank you gnarly for the 250 you playing super mario rpg ost makes me want to see you
[16342.73s -> 16349.69s]  play another mario rpg like paper mario or the mario and luigi series those are some of my
[16349.69s -> 16357.72s]  favorite games ever the mario and luigi series believe it or not is made by some of the same
[16357.72s -> 16363.96s]  people that made super mario rpg same director right there's a alpha dream maybe the developers
[16363.96s -> 16376.10s]  that released back when they were doing that i think that's accurate i have played superstar
[16382.55s -> 16385.99s]  and i've not played the other ones though i would probably like them
[16386.55s -> 16400.14s]  but yeah i wasn't that big of a fan of paper mario not really i respect paper mario but i
[16400.14s -> 16413.88s]  don't really enjoy playing paper mario i respect it but i don't really it didn't grab me like the
[16413.88s -> 16421.90s]  other ones did that may have changed since i've grown older maybe i will appreciate it now than
[16421.90s -> 16437.98s]  i did maybe 10 15 years ago i don't know but that was uh gnarly smelly boy thanks for the 250
[16437.98s -> 16441.98s]  smelly boy germa you're insane if you don't think we'd all watch you do a playthrough of super mario
[16441.98s -> 16448.62s]  rpg seriously what you did for sorcery and played uh seriously do what you did for sorcery and play
[16448.62s -> 16454.54s]  it over the course of a couple weeks like every other stream it would be great uh mario rpg is
[16454.54s -> 16462.55s]  not that long of a game it's you could probably get through the whole thing especially if you know
[16462.55s -> 16467.51s]  what you're doing and where you're going in seven to ten hours i don't think it would take that
[16467.51s -> 16481.80s]  long maybe maybe a little bit longer 12 hours maybe should i should i just do it should i
[16482.44s -> 16497.38s]  what do you think should i do it should i stream super mario rpg yeah i mean yeah of course i'll
[16497.38s -> 16501.38s]  love it i haven't i'd be you know when you find that game that you love and it's like one of your
[16501.38s -> 16508.02s]  favorite games ever made and somehow you stumble into it and end up playing it again every few
[16508.02s -> 16517.02s]  years i have played super mario rpg and beaten it probably yeah like more than 20 30 times
[16517.02s -> 16525.54s]  i play through it probably once every couple years yeah let's do it that would be a chill just
[16525.54s -> 16537.75s]  stream or two yeah let's do it why not we'll do that after connect yeah fuck yeah let's do it
[16537.75s -> 16543.83s]  let's do it i'm ready that music too just made me want to play i want to go down the the river
[16543.91s -> 16553.98s]  again and collect the coins yeah after the connect weekend we'll settle down and i'll play through
[16553.98s -> 16563.30s]  mario rpg still gonna do the gta online casino i still am looking for people to play it there's
[16563.30s -> 16567.78s]  like three or four other streamers that i'm through a line out to and i'm trying to see if we can set
[16567.78s -> 16572.42s]  something up i think that's more fun with other people like streamers or youtubers whatever not
[16572.42s -> 16591.77s]  youtubers we don't i mean she got ghosted it's real money don't they give you like a fake currency
[16591.77s -> 16599.11s]  to use for a little while don't forget sam and max the thing about sam and max is the last couple
[16599.11s -> 16607.21s]  times i was thinking of doing it i was on a poll and people nobody voted for it that's why i'm kind
[16607.21s -> 16614.04s]  i'm kind of waiting i think we hit sam and max exhaustion because i played through both the first
[16614.04s -> 16619.88s]  two seasons pretty close to each other i think we may have seen some sam and max exhaustion
[16620.60s -> 16637.64s]  so i'm just gonna keep it in the pocket for a little while we'll go back to it we will i'm
[16637.64s -> 16641.72s]  not just gonna start it and not finish it especially the fact that it's the third season
[16641.72s -> 16653.69s]  and i did the first two full seasons thank you lemon pudding for the 250 germa apologize publicly
[16653.69s -> 16660.41s]  to fortnight jimmy 2010 for what you did yesterday or i'm gonna tell grill master barbecue about it
[16660.41s -> 16672.55s]  and this time he will ruin your career grill master bbq i don't think it's streamed in like
[16672.55s -> 16689.88s]  seven or eight months so i mean okay he turned it on once he winked at the camera like 15 times
[16690.76s -> 16696.12s]  over the course of about 14 minutes he sat there for about 15 minutes he winked like three four five
[16696.12s -> 16703.02s]  six times few minutes went by he winked and then he turned the stream off i didn't know what he
[16703.02s -> 16707.82s]  was but i think he was part of his he did this thing whereas he did a big arg on his channel
[16708.70s -> 16713.51s]  and he really got way over his head with it he had the hours and hours of arg footage on his
[16713.51s -> 16717.99s]  channel and he was he was doing something with the twitch thing i think it got too much for him
[16717.99s -> 16728.92s]  and he didn't want to do it anymore so he decided not to do it anymore i guess i was keeping up a
[16728.92s -> 16742.49s]  little bit hey thank you raddest raccoon for the 250 hey germa germa chomp just want to tell you
