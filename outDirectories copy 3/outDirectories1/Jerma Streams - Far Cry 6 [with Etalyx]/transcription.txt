[5.50s -> 12.78s]  Hello, how are you? Good to see you.
[12.78s -> 15.58s]  Uh, you know, I was supposed to be live like 10 minutes ago, but I, uh,
[15.58s -> 20.54s]  all like the Twitch stuff, I lost all my connections with all the stuff that I had connected.
[21.70s -> 26.42s]  So my like streaming service stuff that I use, I had to like re-log in.
[26.42s -> 28.34s]  So fuck! How you doing?
[29.30s -> 39.05s]  Oh, here he is. First stream since the leaks. We have to hear what he has to say.
[41.62s -> 45.86s]  Well, first of all, I'll tell you, I was, I was just as surprised as probably maybe a lot of you were.
[46.50s -> 50.30s]  I did not think that I was in that category. I just really didn't.
[51.10s -> 56.22s]  When I saw that list, I was like, holy shit, wow, look at these top 100 fucking streamers.
[56.22s -> 59.74s]  And they make a shitload of money. I wonder where I am. I'm 98. What?
[60.54s -> 64.18s]  Wait, how? What? How? I was very surprised.
[65.14s -> 71.74s]  He's a billionaire. No, no, no. I'm not gonna, look, I'm not gonna touch too much upon this.
[72.54s -> 77.18s]  Uh, you guys, I try to be transparent with money with you guys.
[77.18s -> 78.06s]  Hopefully I have been.
[80.30s -> 84.46s]  Now you know exactly the amount of money that I have taken in from twitch.tv
[84.46s -> 85.82s]  in the last like two plus years.
[86.70s -> 91.96s]  And whatever, I'm just gonna keep using it. That's all there is to it.
[94.66s -> 101.58s]  Number 98. Pay back your debt. The debt's like billions. I only have whatever it was.
[101.58s -> 106.87s]  I don't even have that by the way. That's over the last two, two years and one month, two months.
[107.51s -> 113.19s]  I've been using it. I don't even have it. I don't even have any money.
[114.15s -> 120.04s]  No, I'm gonna make a really just clear before italics is waiting, but let me make a really
[120.04s -> 126.97s]  clear statement on this. Um, don't ever give this channel money unless like you absolutely
[126.97s -> 133.24s]  can afford to. There's literally no reason for you to give this channel more than a sub ever.
[133.80s -> 137.16s]  I just want to make that really clear. I hope that people don't think they have to give this
[137.16s -> 143.38s]  channel money. Hopefully I've been clear on that the last five years or so. Um, and I know I don't
[143.38s -> 146.10s]  want to even, I don't want to talk about this too much because I know anytime you talk about like
[146.10s -> 151.13s]  money, you're coming like a bunch of primes. I don't want, that's not what this is for.
[151.13s -> 156.31s]  I'm not even going to address them, but I'm just going to keep trying to do what I can and
[157.11s -> 161.56s]  use it on the stream. Use it on me too, right? Like I want to make sure that,
[162.44s -> 169.16s]  because there's another thing that's really worth bringing up too, is I mean, I don't know how long
[169.16s -> 174.68s]  this is going to last. I don't think anybody does. So I want to make sure that if I'm going to make
[174.68s -> 179.82s]  this kind of money, I want to have like investments and put it into like accounts that are going to
[179.82s -> 186.63s]  like be okay in five to 10 years. Cause I have no idea how long this is going to last. But there
[186.63s -> 193.29s]  are far other people on this platform that are not in the top 100, top 200 that you should probably
[193.29s -> 203.37s]  be giving your sub to every month. It's probably not me anymore. Let's be honest, right? But we,
[203.37s -> 213.83s]  I could talk about this for like another four hours. Invest in a proper e-clown car. First,
[213.83s -> 217.19s]  second, I thought you said proper e-clown. All right. It's Alex is waiting. Let me say hello.
[219.72s -> 225.88s]  Hey, sorry. I forgot that I haven't addressed the leak since I streamed last. And that happened like
[225.88s -> 238.95s]  in the middle of the week. Yeah. The leak, the leak, what being like a top 30,000 streamer,
[238.95s -> 243.67s]  just making a casual average minimum wage on Twitch. What's there to reveal.
[244.07s -> 255.82s]  All right. We're playing Far Cry 6 today. It's Alex. You don't know who he is. How could you not
[255.82s -> 261.11s]  at this point? Everybody knows who I am because they're real viewers and gamers.
[263.43s -> 269.88s]  I think we're already in the game, right? Yeah, we are in the game. I have to run ads. No,
[269.88s -> 274.36s]  I'm not going to run ads. Like what, you don't understand though. Do you guys get it? Why like,
[274.36s -> 280.20s]  Oh, maybe he should start running ads. Oh, give us ads, Jerma. What? Are you serious? Why would I,
[280.20s -> 284.76s]  why would I do that? There's a bunch of people in your chat saying who right now.
[284.76s -> 288.20s]  Are they? Did you tell them to wear their name tags to the stream today?
[288.84s -> 294.70s]  I, well, you have your name tag on. Sometimes I feel like I have to wear a name tag.
[295.26s -> 305.19s]  I feel like they don't know who I am. All right, let's go. Did I even tweet this? Okay. I'm just
[305.19s -> 312.94s]  going to retweet yours because I'm incredibly lazy. There, that's it. There we go. See? I was
[312.94s -> 317.02s]  talking about how professional we were like doing the whole tutorial before the stream even started.
[317.10s -> 319.90s]  Yeah. But I mean, that's something you have to do in, in these games. And by the way,
[319.90s -> 324.46s]  people are quite curious about the title. I've never sat through an entire Far Cry game. I walk
[324.46s -> 328.94s]  out of the movie in the first act and I keep seeing the sequels. Don't, I don't know why we
[328.94s -> 335.10s]  keep doing this. We go to the Far Cry movie. We don't, we get up and leave the movie and you like
[335.10s -> 340.14s]  effectively showed up late. And I don't mean that as a stream joke. I mean, like you, you,
[340.14s -> 343.82s]  you got into the seat, you crawled over, the lights are already off. You skipped all the cut
[343.82s -> 349.02s]  scenes to get here. I got to like explain the plot. Yeah. I actually truly have no fucking idea
[349.02s -> 355.10s]  what's going on because he did the tutorial last night and I was unaware that, well, he told me,
[355.10s -> 360.70s]  but I just didn't do it because I'm busy. So he did the tutorial last night. It's about an hour
[361.26s -> 366.50s]  and he's like, Hey, did you do, did you do the tutorial yet? And I'm like, no, it's like,
[366.50s -> 368.98s]  can I get through it in like an hour? And he's like, yeah, there's a bunch of cut scenes though.
[369.62s -> 374.58s]  So I'm not kidding. I wish I had it recorded. I sprinted through every single thing. I
[374.58s -> 379.22s]  mashed space bar to skip every single cut scene. I don't even know how to crouch. I have no idea.
[379.22s -> 385.02s]  I just had, I held shift the whole time. But anyways, this is the first segment is like a
[385.02s -> 392.49s]  stealth section too. I just sprint. I ran right through it. I just ran through it. Somebody said,
[392.49s -> 399.46s]  I thought you were done playing Ubisoft games. Uh, this isn't an Ubisoft game. This is Far Cry.
[401.27s -> 406.47s]  It's the same game every time we already played Far Cry four and five. So you can rest assured
[406.55s -> 411.43s]  this is no different. Yeah. But why do we keep going to the movie? This is like you, okay.
[411.43s -> 416.07s]  So again, let's say if Far Cry was a movie and you and I went to the movie together
[416.89s -> 421.77s]  and after like 30 minutes of that movie, we were like, I'm leaving. This movie sucks. Right. And
[421.77s -> 427.35s]  we leave the movie. Why do we keep going to the sequels? Oh, Hey dude, Hey, Far Cry five just
[427.35s -> 430.79s]  came out. Oh, we like, didn't really care that much. And we just kind of goofed around for like
[430.79s -> 436.07s]  three hours in the first. Why do we keep going to the monstrous sequels and leaving boss baby?
[436.07s -> 440.95s]  You don't, you don't watch the whole movie boss, baby. You watch like 30 seconds and then you skip
[440.95s -> 444.63s]  like 10 minutes and then you watch like 30 more seconds. This is what we're doing with all the
[444.63s -> 448.71s]  these movies, trying to see what happens. Oh, you go, you talk about the, uh, the, the skip to the
[448.71s -> 456.70s]  movie thing. Yeah. I love doing that. I think you have to talk to this person. We need to talk.
[456.70s -> 463.19s]  Cause this is your, this is your game, not mine. I accept. Hit that slave camp hard.
[464.47s -> 467.27s]  Okay. I thought she was, she put the gun out. I thought she was going to shoot you.
[468.23s -> 473.72s]  She was like aiming it at you for a second. Okay. Where do we go? I don't, I have no idea
[473.72s -> 476.04s]  what's going on, dude. I have absolutely no idea what's happening. I don't know who that person is.
[476.84s -> 483.16s]  The very first like thing anybody hears in the game is go hit that slave camp hard. That,
[483.16s -> 487.40s]  you know, that's exactly what we're going to do. I don't even know. I don't even know where we are.
[488.44s -> 500.34s]  All right, let's go. You could probably like just, I honestly, wait, we haven't,
[500.34s -> 505.43s]  we have an alligator. Remember that we do. Yes. We have two alligators and you can,
[505.43s -> 512.15s]  you can press E on the alligator. Isn't that so cute? You feed alligator. I already did this.
[513.03s -> 520.73s]  They drop like, you drop like a ham sandwich in his mouth. Come here. I want to do that to mine too.
[521.45s -> 533.98s]  Holy, what the fuck happened? I was just trying to cook the steak. What the hell are you doing?
[534.94s -> 540.07s]  It was just going to be like a cooked steak joke. I don't know. I thought, I don't know. All right,
[540.07s -> 543.51s]  let's go. Let's give me do a mission. We start the game even though I already did. I don't know
[543.51s -> 552.54s]  what's going on. But yeah, welcome guys. This is Far Cry 6. How come you run faster than me?
[553.74s -> 561.72s]  Hold on. First bug. First bug? First bug. Oh, I thought you said like a beetle or something.
[561.72s -> 568.46s]  No, do you see this person? I don't see anybody. She is flying like a T-posing Jesus in my game.
[570.30s -> 578.33s]  I don't see that. I see a gun just sitting here. It's just a floating gun. Can you get on the horse?
[579.13s -> 587.16s]  Don't please put it away. Can you get it? No, I don't. Look, we have to at least get on the road.
[587.96s -> 597.40s]  Okay, you need your own horse. Just get a little further downhill. I could jump on that.
[597.40s -> 599.66s]  Wait, what if you get on the zip line and then land on me?
[599.66s -> 610.79s]  Easy. I can't. Hold on. That's stupid. Run his ass off. Holy shit. Oh my god, that was horrible.
[610.79s -> 617.13s]  Are you all right? Yeah, I'm good. All right. So we're going to go in this way.
[619.29s -> 623.93s]  So there's horses in this game. Why does this feel like it's like 10 FOV? It's going to make
[623.93s -> 630.31s]  me want to puke. I already changed it. You're probably going to get like leashed back to me.
[630.31s -> 635.24s]  You can only be so far from me. I have to like keep the like, you know, the backpack
[635.24s -> 650.49s]  with the child. Are you really that far away? Okay, I got to turn the FOV up. It's like 95.
[650.49s -> 660.01s]  I have it so high already. It's at 95. Should I put it like 110? I think it's just like small
[660.01s -> 665.69s]  on the horse. I think when you get on the horse, it just zooms in to like a nauseating level.
[665.69s -> 673.88s]  Maybe it does. Okay. All right. So we need to go meet Julio. Driving FOV is forced FOV. Okay. I see.
[673.88s -> 683.74s]  I need to find, we need to find like a vehicle. Otherwise we're going to have to walk everywhere.
[683.82s -> 690.46s]  Oh, I'm already there. Oh, I'm coming. Characters like get tired in this park, right?
[694.90s -> 702.07s]  Random. I can't talk to this person though. This is your game. Yes. You're just passing through
[702.07s -> 716.82s]  and the alligator attack him. I got here way before you did. Yeah. Cause I had to walk the whole way.
[716.82s -> 725.30s]  All right. I'm coming. Wait, what? Hold. I had it on toggle. What is this bullshit? I did. I swear
[725.30s -> 739.85s]  to God. What the fuck? Where is it? Okay. There's so many options in this game. How long did it take
[739.85s -> 745.22s]  you to actually sit here and go through each one of these? Um, I didn't. I just turned off motion
[745.22s -> 752.57s]  blur. What are you, what are you changing right now? I don't like to hold, uh, aim down sights.
[752.57s -> 758.01s]  Really? You toggled? Yeah. Toggle gamer? Cause I don't, the pressure with my, uh, Tony. Yes.
[758.01s -> 762.17s]  The pressure on my middle finger hurts. What do you use middle finger? Middle finger is,
[763.06s -> 766.18s]  that's right. Click is for middle mouse button. I'm just kidding. I don't use that either. I was
[766.18s -> 767.78s]  going to say, what are you talking about? All right. Will you talk to this guy?
[768.50s -> 777.72s]  Finally, I'm not going to bullshit you. I wanted to do this alone, but Clara give me an order.
[777.72s -> 784.84s]  I can handle myself. Is there a punch? So he should be here right now, but instead I get you.
[784.84s -> 790.36s]  And I'm supposed to be a Miami, but instead his health bar. I'm stuck here with you.
[790.36s -> 798.31s]  He can't die. Can he? Enough talk. Step one, we hit the tobacco. Step two, we destroy their
[798.31s -> 804.07s]  poison supply. Step three, we get the fuck out of there. And Castillo gets a nice pretty
[804.07s -> 816.63s]  message from you. He uses toggle. Yes, I do. No, I get the horse. That's all right. He's like
[816.63s -> 821.19s]  running after you. He's like, what are you doing? Wait, would you just teleport it over here? Wait,
[821.19s -> 832.49s]  what happened? Why is he choking? What's he choking on? What did he eat? All right, let's go. Leave
[832.49s -> 838.41s]  the horse. We're just doing all the same jokes from the last one. We're watching the same movie.
[839.77s -> 843.93s]  It's okay to do the same jokes because we're watching the same movie. He's waiting for me.
[843.93s -> 848.65s]  I don't know. Where's the farm? I don't know. You killed him. You screwed everything up,
[848.65s -> 854.82s]  I think. He'll protect you from fire. And more importantly, Castillo's fucking poison.
[854.82s -> 860.18s]  Okay, here we go. So what do we have to do? He gave me some gloves. He gave me oven mitts.
[860.18s -> 867.62s]  All right, suit up with that gear. All right. Pretty sick. All right, what we got? We need
[867.62s -> 886.62s]  different gloves. How does this even work? Hazmat? I think I got it on. There it is. What? All right,
[886.62s -> 891.80s]  did you do the how to change gear tutorial? No, yeah, I did it already. Oh, here it is. You're
[891.80s -> 897.18s]  not wearing the gloves. Let's put them on. There you go. That's the first time I've seen the inside
[897.18s -> 902.73s]  of the fucking menu. What is that there for? All right. Are you ready? Let's go get like a car or
[902.73s -> 908.97s]  something. I don't want to walk 700 miles. Let's go. That's a good horse. Wait, he's going too?
[909.85s -> 913.37s]  Are we going to the blue? What's the blue mark? It says follow him. So I think you go walk near
[913.37s -> 926.87s]  him. Oh, okay. But don't run him over though. Is this the walk and talk? It probably is.
[927.67s -> 934.33s]  We actually do get a flamethrower. That's pretty crazy. If I could change anything,
[934.33s -> 939.77s]  it would be me dying on that horse. Okay, the horse is just. I wish I had one. And if she
[939.77s -> 953.90s]  loved you, well, then you could do this. Oh my God. Okay, need to know or challenge complete
[953.90s -> 962.14s]  Ubisoft Connect XP earning. That's way too huge of a notification. He's almost dead. Did I do that?
[962.14s -> 967.82s]  Yes. Get it on your skin. It can make you go fucking crazy or sit like deep down. What happens
[967.82s -> 972.30s]  if he dies though? We probably have to restart it. So let's let's actually try to just get through
[972.30s -> 978.14s]  the first co-op mission. It's a quarter of the screen. Jeremy's going to shoot and kill the
[978.14s -> 983.82s]  NPC. No, I'm not. He is. He is proven already that he's the one doing that this spring.
[985.10s -> 989.42s]  I haven't killed anybody yet. He's still alive. You killed him. I had to revive him. He was just
[989.42s -> 995.74s]  down. That wasn't dead. That's why he still got half health. Right behind you. Oh, yeah.
[995.74s -> 1002.12s]  Don't we have like cell phone cameras? I actually can't fit the horse through here.
[1002.92s -> 1014.92s]  Get over here. All right. Horse is getting abandoned. Okay, so we need to follow him up
[1014.92s -> 1020.25s]  to the top. Yeah, but like what happens if you shoot him while he's on the ladder? He's probably
[1020.25s -> 1027.16s]  gonna fall off. I don't want to craft anything by the way. I don't even like. Oh, there's
[1027.16s -> 1033.54s]  hang on. There's crafting in this game. Of course there is. See the tobacco and the yellow poison
[1033.54s -> 1040.15s]  tanks. Okay, so we have to scout. Punch holes in the tanks to let the poison out into the air.
[1040.15s -> 1044.15s]  By the way, what kind of iPhone is this where they can get this clear of an image
[1044.15s -> 1050.63s]  zooming in this much? It's the kind like, okay, so for context, your side character dies
[1051.67s -> 1057.03s]  when a boat gets shot full of holes and they drown. Oh, okay. But on the beach,
[1057.03s -> 1061.67s]  the first thing they do is say give me my phone and it's still working even though they just like
[1061.67s -> 1071.19s]  washed up on the shore. The phone's like. It's like a super phone. Are you scanning right now?
[1071.83s -> 1077.03s]  I'm just I'm looking around at stuff. I don't know how to do that. Oh, hit X. How do I know
[1077.03s -> 1086.38s]  that you don't? Oh, because I pushed like the other phone. There's no way you get that kind
[1086.38s -> 1091.96s]  of image from this month. Let's make some chaos. Are you fucking kidding me? When I like zoom in
[1091.96s -> 1097.16s]  to take a picture of a bee at one foot away, it's still kind of blurry. Are you kidding me? All
[1097.16s -> 1106.87s]  right. Well, whatever. He just he went down already, man. It's a video game. No, it's not.
[1106.87s -> 1113.00s]  It's real life. Listen, just give iPhone another like seven iterations. They'll have them out in
[1113.00s -> 1117.08s]  the next two years and they'll have camera quality like that. They're purposely holding
[1117.08s -> 1123.00s]  back camera quality so they have another iPhone to release next year. So I can destroy the yellow
[1123.00s -> 1128.82s]  poison tank. What the fuck is the alligator doing? How do you be stealthy with an alligator?
[1128.82s -> 1139.86s]  See what I'm talking about? Like what? How is this a stealth game? By the way, did you turn off bars?
[1140.10s -> 1144.66s]  Well, what would I do? I shot somebody I wasn't supposed to. I think you just shot a civilian.
[1144.66s -> 1162.18s]  What is going on? Destroy the tanks. They've got like poison guns. We have to sabotage. It is so
[1162.18s -> 1170.62s]  loud. I can't even get through the door. You're not even listening to this when your compound's
[1170.62s -> 1176.70s]  getting like raided by two special agents. How do I get through the door? What's happening?
[1176.70s -> 1183.91s]  Who's this guy? I got an enemy. Oops. Oh shit. Hold on. Are we doing the Ubisoft play? All right.
[1183.91s -> 1187.59s]  Coming up on your right here. I'm going to need some support. All right. Sure. Calling it an
[1187.59s -> 1195.86s]  airdrop airdrop. What do you want it? Where should I put it? Hey, there's a guy shooting at us over
[1195.86s -> 1202.01s]  here. Why is it on fire? I got one. I cannot move. I can't fucking move. I can't move the cursor.
[1202.73s -> 1205.77s]  I'm giving you some cover fire. Is that going to be right on top of us? Oh, fuck.
[1208.06s -> 1219.43s]  No shit. I can right click. Where is this? What am I looking at? You're on your own for a second.
[1219.43s -> 1225.69s]  I have to turn this down. It is so loud. How do I get? I can't get off of this. Okay. Wait,
[1231.59s -> 1235.67s]  you just say a Spanish swear word. I don't know why some of the gun sounds so much louder than
[1235.67s -> 1245.18s]  other ones. Eel. It's because one of them has a silencer on it. Okay. We only did 17%. Oh,
[1245.18s -> 1258.50s]  we're going to get this car. Where's the music coming from? Um, how do I drive this? W I get,
[1258.50s -> 1265.46s]  why can't I go to the front seat? Oh, are you kidding me? Yeah. Um, I'm taking this thing.
[1266.18s -> 1277.18s]  Oh, okay. To sabotage the plantation. Here we go. Yeah. We've only destroyed 20%. I think we
[1277.18s -> 1284.22s]  have to like, hang on. Wait a second. Are they doing the like, beginning of the game is the
[1284.22s -> 1294.84s]  first question. Sorry. That was scared the shit out of me. I don't know why. What was that? Oh
[1294.84s -> 1304.57s]  shit. This guy, like I just exploded into blood. Oh no, it wasn't. I thought he just like turned
[1304.57s -> 1319.69s]  into blood mist. It's this guy. Oh my God. All right. Get me out of here. Oh shit. This is bad.
[1319.69s -> 1331.46s]  All right. Alligator is okay. Oh my God. What the fuck? He won't let me in.
[1334.97s -> 1342.58s]  Okay. Burn the red tobacco plants with my, with my toadster USB stick. All right. We got to burn
[1342.58s -> 1356.57s]  these plants and do it. Where's my plan? There. All right. Here we go. Oh shit. It burns.
[1358.97s -> 1372.47s]  You think Spanish songs are still DMC able? I think everything is. Wait, collect gasoline.
[1373.27s -> 1387.77s]  What do I do with this? Watch out, get out of there. How are you supposed to safely do this without
[1387.77s -> 1393.29s]  getting burned? I'm just saying it, but you know, if the DMC people can't understand the lyrics,
[1393.29s -> 1403.10s]  then maybe it's an algorithm, man. It's an algorithm. Okay. Where are you right now?
[1403.10s -> 1406.86s]  And why are you not helping me burn all this? I, I'm over here burning other farms.
[1408.14s -> 1413.10s]  This is co-op. It's cooperative. I don't burn the same farm you're burning. That's redundant.
[1414.70s -> 1428.70s]  Oh, back to front. All right. We're at 50%. This was not a stealth mission anyway. No,
[1428.70s -> 1434.52s]  this is like a, you destroy everything. 3d movie jumpscare.
[1443.50s -> 1449.98s]  Okay. All right. I don't have any more gasoline. It picks them up from a barrel. I have been
[1450.94s -> 1461.64s]  even made one weed joke. No, I mean, that's so easy. There are no weed jokes. Can I like,
[1461.72s -> 1477.10s]  I can't just like cut this down. I changed my weapon. Does that work? He's just on fire
[1477.10s -> 1485.94s]  running through all this. Now I'm on fire. There's still some over here. Do you have any gas left?
[1487.62s -> 1493.94s]  I'm trying to shoot the plants to get rid of them. Really? I'm just saying you can destroy
[1493.94s -> 1501.70s]  the yellow barrels. Wait, that's where the music's coming from. That's it. Okay. You just get the
[1501.70s -> 1507.86s]  shit out of me. I've got a blue friendly icon over my head. This is where the music's coming from.
[1508.26s -> 1513.14s]  So you couldn't tell it was me. This is what I see the volume indicator. That's what the music's
[1513.14s -> 1523.98s]  coming from. What? I don't know what just happened. Yeah, that was a, oh, that's a good guy.
[1526.78s -> 1537.38s]  Okay. Oh shit. What? I have great. Okay. What? Oh, that was, that was my like three and overwatch.
[1537.38s -> 1548.42s]  I don't even know what the fuck I just did. First of all, overwatch joke in 2021.
[1548.42s -> 1551.86s]  Second of all, it's the only watchers in smite. That's the only, the only two moments.
[1552.42s -> 1561.21s]  Well, we did it. We did it. We can, we can go back on my way. Yeah, I think we're good. We can keep
[1561.21s -> 1570.06s]  on. We'll both head back to large stone tower. All right. We did it. Make sure you get your,
[1570.06s -> 1579.13s]  your, where is this music coming from? I think it's just thematic. It's just there to like,
[1579.69s -> 1585.19s]  get you all jazzed up, dude. But I don't, there's no context to where it will be coming from though.
[1588.30s -> 1592.54s]  I don't know. We're apparently sticking it to the government by destroying the drugs,
[1592.54s -> 1599.86s]  which seems counterintuitive. All right, songs over. But I think they're laced with poison.
[1599.86s -> 1603.22s]  Fake raid. Somebody said fake. I don't see a raid, but fake raid.
[1605.70s -> 1614.50s]  Vinny just tried to raid you, but accidentally raided a fake germa. What? Hold on. That, that,
[1614.50s -> 1628.07s]  is that what happened? Well, hi everybody. That I guess not here. He forgot the nine eight five.
[1628.07s -> 1633.75s]  Oh shit. Well, thanks anyways. It's appreciate it. Is this not the large stone tower?
[1634.63s -> 1642.86s]  This looks like it. He's over there though. Wait, he's coming this way. He's pathing.
[1645.30s -> 1655.51s]  Oops. You're okay. Yeah. He was just walking through like the brush. Oops. Yeah. But thanks
[1655.51s -> 1661.51s]  Vinny. If you're watching, that's actually fucking hilarious. Fake germa got a raid.
[1661.99s -> 1670.55s]  Uh, but hey guys, welcome playing Far Cry 6 with it's Alex. Are you, is he good? I think he's good.
[1671.59s -> 1676.09s]  Shit. You really can hold your own. I don't want to say I told you. Did you do your super move?
[1676.09s -> 1681.85s]  Don't fuck around. Don't do that. Stop. What are you throwing at him? This is just the beginning.
[1681.85s -> 1690.33s]  What is those? What do you, how do you do that? How do I do that? Stop. Oh yeah. You're telling
[1690.33s -> 1697.61s]  me to stop. You're like interrupting the NPC cut scene. How do I do it? Okay. It's a
[1698.49s -> 1706.09s]  middle mouse. Yeah. I thought you said it was middle mouse. It is. You have to hit Q
[1706.73s -> 1710.81s]  and then mouse over the, uh, the holster and then mouse wheel.
[1710.81s -> 1743.50s]  Oh my God. I don't know who it is. Is it him? I'm trying to cut the screams off.
[1746.44s -> 1752.17s]  It's then now he's screaming in my game though. All right. If we bring him back,
[1752.25s -> 1760.86s]  let's do the screaming stuff. Okay. Holy shit, dude. That was insane. It was just like,
[1760.86s -> 1771.05s]  somebody was screaming in my ear. I swear to God. Oh, head back to the tower. All right. You want
[1771.05s -> 1776.01s]  to grab a horse? Uh, yeah, we got two horses here. Are you good? Is this streaming? Yeah. I,
[1776.01s -> 1781.13s]  apparently it's, apparently we're fine. I still got to talk to him. Hold on. I can't believe you
[1781.13s -> 1785.61s]  weren't hearing that. It was like a loud human scream in my ear. And they're going to see the
[1785.61s -> 1791.13s]  smoke. We work well together. See, listen, if you were good with it, you did good. Sorry,
[1791.13s -> 1797.59s]  I doubted you. See you back at camp. Okay. Now we're good. That was a quick turn. All right.
[1798.79s -> 1811.70s]  Oh, nice. Now we both have horses. Awesome. Um, do you want to leave or should I?
[1814.18s -> 1822.07s]  Do we have a mission? We should find a car. I mean, this car is back in the, in the drug lab.
[1823.16s -> 1837.37s]  Can you do that? What? Apparently not. Oh yeah. There you go. Nice. My horse wasn't professionally
[1837.37s -> 1842.62s]  trained. Oh, we're on the phone. I hope you can see the smoke from where you are.
[1843.98s -> 1851.99s]  Stop hurting my horse. He's hurting, but okay. I think Lita would be smiling right now.
[1852.15s -> 1856.87s]  Danny, there's someone I want you to meet. Oh, new quest. He's a local fisherman,
[1857.59s -> 1861.67s]  which means votes for Lieberkant. He lives on the east side of Casas Cove.
[1861.67s -> 1866.47s]  Always got nobody's in here. Oh, come on. Really? That would have been really funny.
[1870.42s -> 1874.82s]  So I've been following the story so far and basically here's how it works. Literally any
[1874.82s -> 1879.38s]  person who has speaking lines gets shot in the head at some point. It happens about five times
[1879.38s -> 1886.10s]  in the prologue. Really? Yeah. So, um, basically just violence is the answer, I think.
[1887.30s -> 1891.70s]  I mean, I will say the game is, it's, it's very pretty. It's like the, really the graphics are
[1891.70s -> 1894.66s]  wild. It's only been, uh, we only have been playing for 20 minutes. You're already making
[1894.66s -> 1901.14s]  justifications for your future six out of 10. Okay. Um, I'm, I do. We really, every one of these
[1901.14s -> 1905.06s]  is a six out of 10 locked in. It's grayed out. You can't even, you can't even scroll your mouse
[1905.06s -> 1921.88s]  over it. It's grayed out. It's locked in six out of 10. Dude, why would you swerve to my right?
[1930.28s -> 1939.00s]  Oh, fuck. Oh no. Is he all right? Oh shit. It was random. Is he okay? He's fine. He's all right.
[1940.02s -> 1946.79s]  He's all right. He's still moving around. Get out of here. What the fuck? No, I didn't want
[1946.79s -> 1967.96s]  that to happen. Hey, don't give me that. I can't. What's that? I can't get off of him.
[1974.58s -> 1989.61s]  This guy. I don't know, man. I don't know why I'm riding this guy's ass. You're going too far away
[1989.61s -> 1993.45s]  from your partner. Oh shit. I'm going to lose you. You ran over my horse. I'm like running towards
[1993.45s -> 2003.08s]  you. Wait, where are you? I'm about to hijack a car. Okay. Good. Good. You have to come to me.
[2006.74s -> 2015.43s]  Okay. Is that you? Wait, are you on my? I'm so confused right now. I have no idea what's going
[2015.43s -> 2023.72s]  on. Is that, that's you. It's me. Yeah. Can we get the truck? Yeah. Oh, you just knocked the tree
[2023.72s -> 2031.03s]  down on top of it, but he's fine. Okay. Let's go. Where are we going? Uh, you're, you're the pilot.
[2031.03s -> 2051.29s]  Okay. I'm the pilot. What the fuck did you throw that? That guy say, I know I heard something.
[2052.90s -> 2056.42s]  Yeah. There's a, there's a bad guys are in red. That's how you know they're bad.
[2056.98s -> 2060.90s]  And the good guys are in there. That's how you know they're good. The ex gorilla at his shipyard. Can
[2060.90s -> 2066.50s]  you, um, can you give like a waypoint for us? Oh, it's over here. What the fuck was that?
[2067.14s -> 2075.21s]  Just dogs. They just spawned out of nowhere. They live here. Why are you chasing them? I'm going to
[2075.21s -> 2085.98s]  the marker. See it's the star thing. My character is bored with you driving. So he's just humming to
[2085.98s -> 2098.47s]  himself. You are humming. Are we the questers? I think these are, these are questers. Is this a
[2098.47s -> 2109.62s]  fishing? Might be. There was a joke attempt, but you need a little bit more distance.
[2112.42s -> 2117.14s]  The best part is he's looking over there because the explosions happened over there.
[2117.54s -> 2123.75s]  You're in the big leagues now. It's just the, the sound is what made him us afraid. Not the visual.
[2123.75s -> 2132.07s]  Good. Well, you don't have any friends. One just shut up and call for a car. Oh, a car. Okay.
[2132.07s -> 2138.46s]  And you don't want to craft. Okay. I actually probably a good idea. I don't. Can we even
[2138.46s -> 2145.64s]  craft anything? I think so. Okay. I'm going to do, I'm going to do standard rounds in this
[2146.28s -> 2158.15s]  way. No soft target. They stand around the fine, right? I mean, sure. Charms. Oh, this is a
[2158.15s -> 2171.00s]  cosmetic. Oh, I have skins. Dude, did you get the ultimate edition with like cyberpunk skins?
[2171.00s -> 2177.13s]  Absolutely not. Um, I did all your ride using Q. Okay. Your ride will be delivered to you.
[2179.56s -> 2189.11s]  Okay. Is we actually going to get DMCA for these? I don't, I, I don't know. It was maybe,
[2189.91s -> 2195.66s]  um, hold on. Are we, are we ghostbusters? This, you can throw fucking baseballs. People,
[2195.66s -> 2199.34s]  this game just went, it went a full letter grade. That's what I was doing earlier.
[2199.34s -> 2202.14s]  I was doing that 30 minutes ago when you asked me what I was doing. Oh my God. Oh my God. This
[2202.14s -> 2204.46s]  got a full letter grade. I thought you were throwing, I thought you were throwing knives
[2204.46s -> 2218.22s]  at somebody. I mean, I can do that too. Oh, all right. No stops. So now we have to call our ride.
[2219.02s -> 2229.48s]  I don't have that option. You just put, you hold Q. That was a bad guy.
[2230.44s -> 2237.00s]  It was a bad guy. Yeah, it was a bad guy. Oh, but you can carry bodies.
[2237.72s -> 2245.98s]  Hey, do you, I think, do you have to call a ride? See if you can give you access to a ride.
[2249.83s -> 2269.91s]  You're psycho rides on the way. All right. No, don't, you just got this. It's so,
[2269.91s -> 2277.11s]  it's so hard to like judge the range. All right. You drive. I'll be the, I'll be the guy that goes
[2277.27s -> 2283.59s]  gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk. Let's see. Oh no, I was wrong. Okay.
[2290.89s -> 2292.09s]  Where are we going? I don't know.
[2296.12s -> 2302.82s]  Look, anti aircraft cannons. Okay. Secure drives to the right for no reason.
[2303.46s -> 2312.07s]  You got all of them, like what the, you, those are bad guys, right? I don't think two of them were.
[2312.07s -> 2315.75s]  I think they were just like, just going to desynchronize me. Like assassin's creed.
[2316.55s -> 2328.35s]  They were wearing red you can't wear red out here my games lagging. Oh, there we go. I'll switch. Where you going?
[2328.35s -> 2333.69s]  I'm trying to drive in a straight line, but unironically it's pulling to the right. He's actually the gas station go
[2334.47s -> 2336.90s]  Why is it making the aim over there?
[2337.46s -> 2341.61s]  What I think auto-aim just took that over?
[2342.13s -> 2352.12s]  All right, let's go. Are you okay? You sold the car. I mean I was
[2353.10s -> 2364.77s]  Are you what I'm trying to assess the situation here get
[2366.82s -> 2372.49s]  Ghost bus this car. I know what the fuck
[2379.34s -> 2399.42s]  Are you hooked on to that car? Yes, are we going? Oh, no, here comes the ghost buster. Oh
[2401.72s -> 2413.91s]  Am I kind of scared of what's coming down the road here? How do you turn the radio off? Uh, left slash
[2414.71s -> 2416.20s]  Why?
[2416.20s -> 2423.43s]  We're all just waiting to see what you do

[2425.67s -> 2430.94s]  What what you're in the little car, right? I mean I'm attached to the little car
[2431.54s -> 2435.80s]  I'm not gonna ram into you at full speed because that's too easy. No, it was
[2436.28s -> 2439.72s]  Minus two. No, that would be a plus two. That'd be a minus two
[2440.36s -> 2446.76s]  See I am a person of refined taste and I was just waiting on a better option to arrive
[2447.12s -> 2449.86s]  But that that's a better option watch out for the alligator
[2450.52s -> 2454.81s]  Well, they can chat loves easy jokes. Somebody just said yeah
[2455.57s -> 2464.21s]  I'm the one that died

[2523.59s -> 2535.51s]  Water's very clean. How the hell did you get from the car to there? I just swam
[2536.37s -> 2539.43s]  Okay. Yeah, but you like actually teleported from underwater
[2540.85s -> 2547.97s]  Yeah, this only said that took ten seconds for you to do that, but it also keep in mind I
[2548.65s -> 2550.65s]  Saved us probably two or three minutes
[2551.49s -> 2555.78s]  driving that way, um
[2556.18s -> 2560.14s]  Something over on this other side here
[2560.34s -> 2569.41s]  Yeah, how do you get up there? Oh, I was just trying to make us that it's screaming
[2569.93s -> 2574.22s]  So this is gonna save us time
[2574.22s -> 2587.54s]  It's your ass. It is. Yep. Thank you
[2587.98s -> 2604.55s]  Why have you done this? You know what?
[2605.15s -> 2618.23s]  All right, I'll activate it. Will you just teleport to me and you teleport to me?
[2619.11s -> 2630.60s]  Probably oh, it's right here. Okay, you can't ride wild horses. You really can
[2631.28s -> 2639.38s]  No, I mean, there's this tame and there's wild horses. I'd be my alligator gonna hang out
[2639.94s -> 2655.80s]  Turn on friendly fire. It's already on be careful. Don't go that don't fall. Oh, there you are
[2656.32s -> 2660.57s]  Over here where the I'm ready for the mission. Okay, you ready?
[2661.27s -> 2672.33s]  Which we're trespassing currently? I think pretty much everything we do in this frame is illegal. Oh
[2673.25s -> 2674.45s]  boat
[2674.45s -> 2680.07s]  That boats really far and probably not drivable. Oh, is it just an asset?
[2680.07s -> 2684.21s]  Is it just like a faraway like JP like whatever the image thing?
[2684.93s -> 2692.44s]  There are tanks we can ride too. Okay, so this is what is this?
[2693.04s -> 2694.99s]  Well, I think we've just
[2694.99s -> 2698.71s]  Who is who somebody talking to me? I think we're supposed to blow this tank up
[2701.62s -> 2710.79s]  What happened blue tank up? Oh you fired at me? Okay. All right. There was a tank. Hold on. How do I get you up?
[2715.24s -> 2716.44s]  repair

[2719.61s -> 2724.03s]  Get her
[2724.03s -> 2731.20s]  She's getting in the tank. She's getting in the tank. I'm just making you aware. She's in the tank now
[2731.44s -> 2733.44s]  She's driving the tank
[2733.44s -> 2735.44s]  She's just taking the first
[2738.00s -> 2741.97s]  Listen, why does it say repair the tank if they're gonna drive the tank?
[2741.97s -> 2746.66s]  Oh, why did you mortar me when I was standing next to it said destroy? I didn't listen
[2746.66s -> 2752.36s]  It said blow up the tank. It's fine. We're right here. We're fine. Let's go
[2756.92s -> 2759.48s]  Taking care of a commandant a problem for Benito
[2766.52s -> 2770.12s]  Find some high ground do some scouting before you alright, I'm stealth
[2770.84s -> 2778.24s]  I'm stealth. We're invisible. I'm inside of a flower patch. Oh fuck. I just looked at me. What the fuck off not stuff anymore
[2782.92s -> 2789.96s]  Like that guy's running to get in the tank by the way, he definitely is
[2794.80s -> 2800.28s]  Okay, he's getting inside the tank he's inside nobody else
[2801.12s -> 2803.36s]  somebody else in this tank
[2804.88s -> 2810.88s]  What the fuck are you dead somebody's just named the tank of my face oh he was in it
[2812.32s -> 2817.48s]  Fire I thought that's the tank you were talking about you were like hiding behind that tank
[2817.48s -> 2821.72s]  It was like dude. Look somebody's running to take no now. They're getting in
[2821.72s -> 2822.32s]  Oh my god
[2822.32s -> 2825.52s]  They saw me and they're running in the tank and I thought you were like setting up for a joke
[2825.52s -> 2829.76s]  I mean, I when he turned really slowly to look at me. I kind of wanted him to shoot me point-blank range
[2829.80s -> 2833.52s]  I'll be honest. I'll be honest with my voice just do it there. That was weird
[2834.76s -> 2836.28s]  popping it
[2836.28s -> 2839.16s]  All right, let's just let's get in here
[2849.81s -> 2851.81s]  Parachute is still on
[2851.93s -> 2854.75s]  Get your parachute off, bro
[2854.95s -> 2856.95s]  That's why they can see us
[2857.35s -> 2863.68s]  That is so stupid
[2864.16s -> 2873.22s]  Get in there and fight him on in there. It's your you're the birthday boy right now
[2873.70s -> 2879.41s]  Just to make sure everybody knows who the birthday boy is. Oh my god the tank
[2880.29s -> 2882.29s]  Put the phone down you idiot
[2882.57s -> 2897.13s]  Hell, what do you mean help? I go. Let's actually for
[2899.65s -> 2901.41s]  Your
[2901.41s -> 2907.29s]  When they get in the tank, they just got the parachute does fucking the parachute just swept the whole thing up
[2907.29s -> 2909.29s]  Okay, it was a major distraction
[2909.29s -> 2915.09s]  I killed like eight people. Okay, we have to like go in there and just like sabotage the tanks with mortars and shit
[2915.13s -> 2922.96s]  We're gonna okay. All right, look
[2923.96s -> 2929.87s]  First of all, what let's just make sure what mission even is this go to the depot and free up the fuel so we can
[2929.87s -> 2935.53s]  Survive and kill the commandant. So they think twice about trying again. Okay, this is a major mission. We're about to do
[2935.71s -> 2942.76s]  This is rank four. Look, I bet I bet I could do this in stealth by myself. You think so? Yeah, okay
[2942.76s -> 2944.76s]  Let's find out. I'll be watching
[2944.80s -> 2946.80s]  Okay. Hang on. I'm gonna leave Guapo here. I
[2959.71s -> 2961.71s]  Mark them for you. Yeah
[2962.11s -> 2973.76s]  Is that actually working? I got this
[2975.95s -> 2985.09s]  Birthday boy assassination mission. Nice. Very very nice. Very nice. I think one person's running to me
[2985.93s -> 2987.93s]  You've got one person in front of you
[2988.17s -> 2990.61s]  We isn't on the mountain directly under you
[2991.21s -> 2998.66s]  Yep, they're coming in. I don't think they know of your presence yet. Somebody actually underneath me too. There's two people
[3001.20s -> 3004.84s]  Guy you're gonna be right in front of you. Careful. He's aiming his gun down towards the
[3005.84s -> 3007.44s]  the outside area
[3007.48s -> 3013.54s]  You see him? Okay, are they facing me or away from me? He is facing you and you are
[3014.02s -> 3017.62s]  He's like above that lip. If you go if you jump up, he's gonna be right there looking at you
[3018.14s -> 3022.94s]  They're actually all coming up there right now. They're like climbing up there. Yes, that guy's climbing the ladder in front of you
[3022.94s -> 3024.94s]  What? That guy's climbing up there
[3025.14s -> 3027.56s]  There's a guy up here
[3027.56s -> 3032.33s]  You're chasing him right now. This guy knows you're chasing him. He's running away from you
[3032.77s -> 3042.96s]  Okay, now they're going up that ladder. Why are they all up there? I don't know. I think they heard you
[3043.08s -> 3051.91s]  I haven't been spotted yet. They're coming down sliding back down. They're both down. Oh
[3055.99s -> 3064.73s]  Oh, you got you got two different people here. Oh here is the commander?
[3065.17s -> 3067.65s]  Yeah, the commander's here and there's three people on the other side
[3068.29s -> 3071.30s]  Listen, I need some Ubisoft call-outs
[3072.10s -> 3074.10s]  sure
[3074.94s -> 3084.68s]  Well, watch out on your three three o'clock no nice nice three o'clock
[3085.52s -> 3087.24s]  Awesome, dude. Good job
[3087.24s -> 3089.72s]  Straight ahead
[3089.72s -> 3095.68s]  Watch out watch out
[3095.68s -> 3104.07s]  He's this guy's angry. This guy's angry up on your left side. You can see him right there right in front of him
[3104.55s -> 3113.75s]  Come on. Give him the booyah. There it is. Nice job. Nice job booyah. They're suspicious
[3113.75s -> 3122.32s]  I don't know if you can really get these two
[3122.92s -> 3124.44s]  They see the body
[3124.44s -> 3128.16s]  The one on the far side is the one
[3128.24s -> 3131.79s]  No, it's really hard to not just get out of this binoculars and press V
[3131.79s -> 3135.78s]  I tell you how hard it is for me not to do that right now. This guy sees
[3136.34s -> 3140.15s]  Uh-oh, you're not two people see oh, they all see now you're in trouble
[3140.67s -> 3145.63s]  That guy's true. That guy just threw ice bottle. I got a through like a way. What do you just do? He's really a firework
[3146.23s -> 3152.76s]  What the fuck is this guy doing? I got a shot of the layer in the
[3154.78s -> 3157.74s]  I just used my best stealth maneuver. Let me help you. Oh
[3163.40s -> 3171.06s]  Fuck oh wait, I killed him. Was that you? I just killed that guy. Is there a mortar? Yeah. Wait, hang on
[3171.94s -> 3178.62s]  You shot that was me. I shot it from here. You did yours and then I did mine and we did we doubled them
[3178.82s -> 3183.78s]  There was not a guy like you just mortared me. That was the only guy left
[3184.38s -> 3191.93s]  After that I got a sniper rifle
[3195.65s -> 3198.08s]  Okay, so that was cool. Let's get a tank
[3198.56s -> 3208.65s]  We actually drive this one enter as driver. Okay, can we both get why did it did it not let us drive?
[3209.65s -> 3211.21s]  During the mission
[3211.21s -> 3212.45s]  apparently not
[3212.45s -> 3217.62s]  If I don't get in this tank, I'm no I'm not going to I
[3218.06s -> 3223.58s]  Actually want to roll into the next mission with two tanks and scare the absolute shit out of the like four guards
[3223.58s -> 3231.79s]  We have to take down because this is mission number two of the game. Don't do it. No, we have to let's make it work
[3231.79s -> 3237.35s]  I I'd literally just looked I have to look where I'm going. The turret just happens to point where I'm looking
[3237.35s -> 3241.15s]  Okay, I'm not gonna like always that really we just won the mission. I
[3241.71s -> 3243.71s]  I just won the mission
[3243.79s -> 3249.61s]  We are so far away from this one. I don't better get going
[3250.80s -> 3252.80s]  Which way we have a mission?
[3253.00s -> 3264.54s]  It's the other way. It's like behind you. It's it's as far away from the possibly could be map seems kind of small
[3264.54s -> 3266.54s]  I wonder if I'm if it opens up later
[3266.94s -> 3271.98s]  This is one of the islands. I think there might be more than one. Yeah
[3272.54s -> 3278.19s]  This thing actually fucking moves for a tank. Holy shit
[3278.71s -> 3281.41s]  This looks driving way too fast for a tank
[3282.09s -> 3284.03s]  tanks
[3284.03s -> 3291.60s]  Maybe the sense of speed is warped. We're just so used to walking everywhere. They didn't just tell this guy's
[3296.54s -> 3298.54s]  1800 this is gonna take so long
[3299.38s -> 3306.58s]  Are you shooting the machine? Oh, that's a machine gun
[3307.36s -> 3314.58s]  No, don't shoot that tanks are deceptively fast
[3314.58s -> 3318.18s]  I think the only reason why is because there any time you see a tank in like a movie or a TV show
[3318.18s -> 3320.18s]  it's just going like
[3321.06s -> 3325.69s]  Like two miles per hour for some reason you never see tanks moving fast
[3333.25s -> 3339.09s]  I I did not know there was a person there. Wait, you you moved the thing you hit him with the stick
[3342.50s -> 3346.54s]  You turn you turn and aim you're gonna hit sliding the head
[3348.71s -> 3362.98s]  She ducked she actually ducked underneath it. No, don't I think you hit a stick sandwich
[3365.82s -> 3380.12s]  It's not you don't run into the road get out of here get out of here get out get out move
[3380.64s -> 3388.84s]  this is like when you spawn in the tank in GTA like
[3389.84s -> 3391.84s]  like battlefield now, I
[3392.44s -> 3399.14s]  Wouldn't surprise if you'd like turned around. It was like just for like green like player number like usernames
[3411.53s -> 3417.35s]  You heard a drive
[3417.35s -> 3418.75s]  every time
[3418.79s -> 3427.25s]  Now they're gonna just back off into a ravine you you killed that guy that was you that did that
[3429.11s -> 3432.55s]  Everything is so loud
[3432.67s -> 3434.39s]  Would I kill?
[3434.39s -> 3440.31s]  Your killing them. I why am I getting dude? You're you're doing dishonorable kills while we're in the same party
[3440.31s -> 3442.31s]  I'm getting negative points because of that
[3442.31s -> 3448.47s]  We're here to liberate the island. Okay, we use some unconventional means. We're trying to free the people
[3449.84s -> 3452.06s]  What
[3452.06s -> 3454.94s]  Necessary sacrifice. This is so loud. I
[3455.46s -> 3465.75s]  Can't hear anything besides tank sounds. Did they try to spike strip us didn't work
[3466.19s -> 3476.26s]  I'm trying to do the thing that I used to do in TF2 or I would just load into like bad water
[3476.86s -> 3478.86s]  come out of the spawn and just
[3479.18s -> 3484.30s]  Aim the huntsman and just shoot it into the air and hope to God that I hit somebody in the head
[3484.30s -> 3486.30s]  I think every single person
[3486.82s -> 3488.38s]  Cod like
[3488.38s -> 3490.26s]  Throwing nice beginning of match. Yeah
[3490.26s -> 3496.40s]  And the thing is it sucks because in like 10 plus years that I played TF2 the hundreds of hours
[3496.40s -> 3500.20s]  I probably played Huntsman sniper it never happened. It was that's just disappointing
[3500.20s -> 3503.16s]  You think that maybe once in like 5,000 10,000 chances it would work
[3504.16s -> 3507.60s]  I mean, that's that's why it took so long to record the videos
[3510.40s -> 3519.77s]  All right, so what are we doing here secure gasoline two poles glamour to be we got to secure the gasoline
[3520.37s -> 3528.31s]  Really? This is gonna stop a tank a
[3528.96s -> 3530.96s]  fucking parking garage
[3531.00s -> 3533.69s]  little strip
[3534.49s -> 3536.49s]  I
[3539.24s -> 3543.48s]  Told you this is we're way over prepared for the second mission of the game. Oh
[3544.24s -> 3547.36s]  I think it's both the gas station. I think it's blue gas station
[3548.00s -> 3550.30s]  I'm just letting you go first
[3550.34s -> 3552.34s]  Alright, don't blow up those tanks
[3552.46s -> 3557.83s]  To cure fuel. Alright, we need to secure this bill. I'm gonna get out
[3558.47s -> 3560.02s]  Pardon me
[3560.02s -> 3564.68s]  That wasn't me that that I haven't done a thing
[3565.20s -> 3573.55s]  You just got killed on by the actual regular guys after after getting up on a soapbox and saying how over prepared we were
[3573.97s -> 3578.57s]  Hold on. I'm gonna come save him. I would be careful. I'm probably gonna spawn in but in your car
[3581.65s -> 3588.11s]  Yeah, I don't think you can get me nice. All right
[3593.18s -> 3596.32s]  So security the gas
[3596.64s -> 3608.04s]  I said one slow motion. Right? Yeah, did you go slow mo? Um, I just killed that guy. I know
[3608.04s -> 3615.60s]  Oh, it was the last it was the last guy. Nice. We got it job
[3620.24s -> 3621.44s]  Excuse me
[3621.44s -> 3627.40s]  No, excuse me. No alarms sounded like how the radio every single time is like, okay
[3627.40s -> 3632.28s]  So what you're gonna want to do is get up on a like high place use your camera spot as many enemies as you can
[3632.28s -> 3636.30s]  I'm trying to stay in stealth. I was coming to tanks
[3637.10s -> 3642.04s]  Yeah, it said we've didn't sound an alarm we were the alarm
[3648.50s -> 3651.57s]  Okay, overcome the regime to become stronger
[3652.17s -> 3656.83s]  Stay in the tanks for the whole game. That's kind of no, that's kind of boring. I want to fly around like helicopters on
[3659.38s -> 3666.92s]  I'm ready for my new toy. Excuse me developers
[3670.36s -> 3672.36s]  Look at how spoiled we really are
[3672.64s -> 3678.68s]  The tank was fun to drive around a tank and shoot stuff, but I want something else done with this thing. I'm done with it
[3679.36s -> 3685.65s]  Yeah, I want I want I want a helicopter that can go on the water
[3686.29s -> 3691.20s]  That shoots missiles out the front and I want to be able to flat fast travel with it
[3691.20s -> 3696.24s]  I want to fly and I wanted to go into ground to how come there's no subterranean shit in Far Cry. I'm bored
[3696.64s -> 3702.28s]  I'm bored
[3703.28s -> 3708.63s]  I see what you're doing. I saw that
[3710.45s -> 3719.00s]  That guy is now yeah, you fired you fired guns of his doing on the motorcycle now he's going very fast to get away from you
[3729.37s -> 3744.49s]  I'm kind of wedged. Oh nice. Thank you. Why would you drive directly into this? Don't you think it hit the brakes? Oh my god
[3745.09s -> 3749.68s]  Did you do that? You did? Yes, you did
[3750.68s -> 3756.36s]  Okay, the alligators are cool and shit like them, but what what the hell what are they doing here?
[3756.72s -> 3760.68s]  Why are they here? This is like no reason for them to be out here right now. I don't know everybody
[3760.68s -> 3766.56s]  Let's stay home. They've run. They don't they don't get in the car. They just run behind us
[3767.20s -> 3773.58s]  That seems just so strange. It shouldn't happen. What the hell's going on here?
[3774.10s -> 3783.74s]  Who is that? It's like it's like a random event. Okay, I think we need to save this guy
[3783.74s -> 3786.68s]  I
[3789.74s -> 3796.18s]  Don't I know what you get that I'll get that away. I see what you were doing. I'm not doing any
[3796.18s -> 3802.14s]  I'm just yes, you are yeah observing with a with your gun. Okay, look at the clouds. Oh, they're so beautiful
[3802.86s -> 3808.01s]  What's he doing? Oh, he's taking the gun. All right night. Can we hang out? Let me hang out this good
[3808.01s -> 3810.01s]  I see you what?
[3811.65s -> 3822.94s]  Bad guy, this is bad guy. That was a bad. I mean, he's a good guy. I
[3824.57s -> 3829.07s]  See you I kind of I want to can this guy be getting the tank with us
[3829.67s -> 3834.48s]  See if you can like can you recruit people in like park ride 5? It looks like he's kind of with us
[3834.48s -> 3837.32s]  Maybe it was because he picked up a gun if he follows you
[3837.92s -> 3843.86s]  Here I go, oh
[3844.74s -> 3849.34s]  Did you wait that was you I have I okay is it if you hit right?
[3849.34s -> 3851.18s]  I said I know it's one HP
[3851.18s -> 3854.74s]  But if you hit right-click does it fire the machine gun till you hit right-click again?
[3854.74s -> 3858.13s]  All right. No, you just hold the button down. Let's I
[3859.33s -> 3863.01s]  It's toggle because right-click is toggle for me that includes this
[3863.65s -> 3869.75s]  Apparently for some reasons is aimed on sites. It's the same thing. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not this is firing
[3869.75s -> 3872.43s]  It's not but in the game it is. All right, does he follow us?
[3873.31s -> 3878.31s]  You killed him. I didn't I didn't he's alive. Why did you assume he's dead? I don't know cuz I saw an explosion
[3878.91s -> 3888.70s]  That guy is a bad guy. I don't know. They just rammed into me with a horse at night
[3888.70s -> 3894.30s]  I don't think that's a bad guy. I don't know what he's did he say. Sorry
[3895.02s -> 3906.86s]  Where's he going? I feel like we kind of need to see these this guy's story how it plays out
[3907.50s -> 3909.50s]  He's gonna have a real short one
[3909.66s -> 3920.59s]  All right, where is he? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? He just run him over
[3921.33s -> 3923.83s]  No, he's right here. That's not him
[3926.03s -> 3929.19s]  Who's this guy? That's not him. That's the that's a different guy. Oh
[3931.07s -> 3934.22s]  That's a different guy. Where'd I friend go?
[3934.90s -> 3942.28s]  He D. No, he's right here. All right, let's walk. I want to see what this guy goes. We have to see how this plays up
[3942.82s -> 3955.75s]  What's he doing? I don't know. Maybe we can't maybe he's not gonna do anything. Why is he down here? I don't know
[3956.35s -> 3967.50s]  Guapos in the way. Yeah, I'm trying to move him. Wait. He's found a thing. Do you play it found a place to go?
[3967.82s -> 3979.47s]  No, I think I think we've lost this guy's not gonna do anything
[3979.63s -> 3982.65s]  Wait, so we expect way too much from this guy. I mean we kind of do
[3983.19s -> 3989.42s]  Can you like I don't think we can like tell him to come with us. I almost killed him. I saw the knife
[3989.42s -> 4002.22s]  Yeah, that was scary. I don't know. Maybe if we just give him some space he'll wander back to the road. No, I
[4002.98s -> 4011.39s]  Wait, he sees something. He does. Yeah, something sees us
[4011.91s -> 4030.04s]  Move your guapo. Are you going up? I don't see anything so far. Oh, there's a guy over there
[4035.34s -> 4048.73s]  Wait, I hear something that you all right is you okay. All right good
[4057.41s -> 4071.10s]  I'm just making sure the road was clear. I can't kill him. He's
[4072.61s -> 4074.61s]  Yeah, you can't kill anybody with baseballs
[4074.93s -> 4088.50s]  Excuse me. All right, he'll be fine. Let's go. I'm trying so hard not to snipe him with the tank. Oh do it
[4088.92s -> 4094.13s]  He might show up later your play resonate before it's like a telltale moment
[4094.13s -> 4098.45s]  and when you like rescue the you rescue the dog and they're like in the first 10 minutes of the game and
[4098.97s -> 4102.29s]  Then spoil this for as an evil for whatever who cares games like 15 years old
[4102.29s -> 4110.72s]  Why did you cuz I want to get in? Oh, I don't think I can I can repair him
[4111.04s -> 4113.20s]  There's a there's a gunner seat. Is there I?

[4146.97s -> 4149.29s]  I try to figure out what you're doing. What are you doing?
[4151.89s -> 4156.53s]  In this work. I was the next mission returned if we got to go back to the camp. Is it marked?
[4156.53s -> 4161.09s]  I think it's just down the road. All right, let's go
[4166.94s -> 4171.18s]  Good. Yeah, I'm good. What? Okay. You're just oddly quiet
[4171.90s -> 4191.03s]  Something is very loud. It's okay. We're friends. We just have a quiet road trip. I said, what are you gonna be for Halloween?
[4191.75s -> 4195.19s]  The Dark Knight Joker that's what I am every single fucking year
[4195.19s -> 4199.47s]  I go I do I go to Halloween every year as the as the Dark Knight Joker
[4200.11s -> 4204.53s]  And I like go up to people I go, you know how I got these scars like I just won't drop it

[4232.51s -> 4235.84s]  I'm a I am in a tank
[4238.08s -> 4240.08s]  True that's true. Is this guy see me?
[4246.30s -> 4248.67s]  I can't move
[4249.07s -> 4254.18s]  Why was he about it looked like he was about to be like a ranger? Oh
[4254.90s -> 4259.30s]  Yeah, I'll be eating you if I didn't anymore he's about to do like the nemesis system thing
[4259.30s -> 4261.30s]  He just like everything froze and it just looked at him
[4264.56s -> 4270.06s]  You got it. Oh shit. All right, we're gonna get a gun
[4278.21s -> 4292.01s]  Crisis of birth. Oh, you know, at least it's well gotta be crap. That's it. Whoa. All right. Let's get a Jeep tanks
[4292.01s -> 4294.49s]  It's not boring. I want a boring new car
[4295.49s -> 4296.53s]  dude
[4296.53s -> 4298.53s]  Can we get the person we just rescued in here?
[4299.25s -> 4305.09s]  Game's not fun unless there's always a nemesis guy to come up with like we've had
[4305.97s -> 4308.53s]  free stinking dies
[4309.81s -> 4313.33s]  Am I right? Yeah, it's only it's only funny when you get
[4314.94s -> 4318.59s]  What's happening?
[4325.05s -> 4328.85s]  That guy's blew his tires why he blows tires
[4331.01s -> 4339.74s]  And she I don't want to hit her I can't move can she get in hey
[4340.58s -> 4348.56s]  I see them. Well, how do I hunt the horn? It's G
[4349.14s -> 4356.51s]  Can we get their crocs in the back seat? Oh, I guess I guess they don't they can't jump in the back. That's kind of weird
[4361.82s -> 4366.43s]  Are you going turning around?
[4366.83s -> 4372.42s]  Okay. Oh my god. What is what is this?
[4373.42s -> 4376.66s]  It's an anti-tank is it underwater fucking landmine
[4377.30s -> 4379.30s]  What the hell why oh my god?
[4379.82s -> 4384.22s]  But it is D day in case in case somebody tries to invade this little beach inlet
[4384.86s -> 4395.11s]  They better not be another one right here. All right heading up this way
[4395.75s -> 4397.55s]  We might have to get out and climb
[4397.55s -> 4404.15s]  Why would we it's a fact like it's right here. I with I can't I can't drive up there. I don't think
[4413.31s -> 4416.63s]  It's it's Claris. Oh, yeah, we're going back to the camp
[4417.15s -> 4427.33s]  Maybe they'll give us a toy. I hope so if they don't I'm going to cry in the middle of the toy aisle
[4427.33s -> 4431.70s]  Oh, I thought that was an animal. No, just a bag
[4432.24s -> 4439.47s]  They use Zonk right now. No
[4441.10s -> 4442.82s]  Why should I be?
[4442.82s -> 4454.23s]  Here we go. So
[4454.23s -> 4459.46s]  We skipping the cutscene or are we gonna watch because I don't know I will try to skip it
[4459.46s -> 4481.02s]  How do you skip it? Um, I don't think we can it's just a black screen. Yeah, this is black screen the fire
[4481.02s -> 4484.65s]  Oh, there we go
[4485.37s -> 4487.37s]  Cinematic with partner, okay
[4489.61s -> 4497.16s]  We are the worst like we really are what's the point of like what what's the point of us playing this I mean
[4497.16s -> 4502.06s]  We get to the gameplay. Okay, I just drive around cinematic trailers. Okay get to
[4502.34s -> 4508.78s]  Gameplay, am I right gamers? I mean, we're just just driving and running people over the cars and I throw grenades and stuff
[4509.12s -> 4516.02s]  I guess that's fun, right? It's fun. Just kind of ride around and just drive around and ride around and drive around
[4516.98s -> 4523.79s]  Whatever I was saying. All right, let's go. No, we have to get a mission. Oh shit. We probably shouldn't have skipped that
[4528.41s -> 4533.61s]  New toy they heard you the developers are listening
[4535.57s -> 4545.19s]  I'll make sure my fiery corpse comes down on you. Okay, I'm gonna put on like different clothes because I feel like I should be doing
[4545.19s -> 4549.77s]  That right. Do we have different clothes? I think so. Yeah, you have gear. We've gotten some stuff
[4550.19s -> 4558.25s]  We've like new weapons. Don't we I have a watch. I have a sniper rifle. I'm putting this thing on
[4558.73s -> 4579.82s]  Okay, how's the sniper if I want air support? I'll have to blow it up. All right, we need to uh, there we go
[4579.82s -> 4587.62s]  Hmm look like oh shit. Okay, I zoom in
[4591.55s -> 4594.62s]  Really was it what's the point of having a scope?
[4595.38s -> 4600.17s]  Yes, you saw it too. It's basically just
[4600.69s -> 4605.06s]  it's like when it's like when people play shooters that don't have cross airs and
[4605.63s -> 4612.07s]  You just tape where the center of the screen is like on the middle of your monitor so that you know
[4612.51s -> 4614.51s]  Where to hit fire?
[4615.47s -> 4620.07s]  New photos, what are they? Okay, cool. So we have to destroy the
[4620.59s -> 4629.28s]  Sam site there are a bunch of horses here
[4629.28s -> 4635.28s]  We say we can't ride these if they got a saddle on them you can yeah, these are not wild
[4635.28s -> 4638.48s]  That's how you tell the difference from this with a tame horse in a wild horse
[4638.48s -> 4646.38s]  I don't know if you knew this but if you see like horses in nature, they don't come prepped with leather saddles
[4646.38s -> 4652.64s]  Um, I don't other equipment. I don't have I don't have the ability to go on. Hey, can you climb it?
[4652.64s -> 4655.14s]  Why can I not do that? I don't worry
[4655.34s -> 4658.98s]  I'm a friend. All right, so we're gonna get that on the map. Where is it over there?
[4659.26s -> 4670.76s]  We have to go destroy this shit just like okay, when did far cry become just cause when they made six of them
[4670.88s -> 4675.12s]  Hey, we got to go over here and like blow this up. Hold on. We gotta go over there and blow that up
[4675.84s -> 4690.20s]  New mission. What are we? What are you blowing up? So is there a difference between I mean, it's like not really
[4690.86s -> 4692.58s]  This horse is in this one
[4692.58s -> 4699.52s]  Let's go
[4699.52s -> 4707.80s]  Do you think that the reason why they keep making far cry games because all the far cry games are independent of each other, right?
[4708.12s -> 4713.73s]  You think the reason is because they don't if they came out with this game and it was called like
[4714.93s -> 4720.41s]  Into the abyss or something right and it was not a fire crap far cry game people would be like this is just a far cry game
[4720.41s -> 4724.65s]  What the fuck are you doing? Like what is this game them numbering these far cry games?
[4724.65s -> 4728.49s]  I think gives them some leeway where it's just hey, it's just another far cry game. Don't worry
[4728.93s -> 4732.94s]  They don't have to explain like why it's so similar. How do you fish?
[4733.50s -> 4741.30s]  We have fishing rod as a reward. It's a known brand. Yeah, they can't make this another game
[4741.86s -> 4750.95s]  Be nice horse. How do you fish? I don't know. We got a fishing rod. Yeah
[4751.43s -> 4760.35s]  Well, there's like a spot right here on the weapon wheel. Oh shit. Oh, nice. There it is
[4760.87s -> 4770.83s]  Okay, look for fishing spots each has opened the tackle box to equip the right fishing gear the right fish and then cast the line
[4770.83s -> 4788.12s]  I would toy the tackle box. I didn't get the horse with that, right? Okay. All right tackle box
[4788.12s -> 4790.62s]  What are we looking for? We're looking for fish
[4791.10s -> 4795.82s]  Okay, let's put on a um, I don't think you actually have to change anything cuz we don't have anything
[4796.14s -> 4813.18s]  Yeah, we don't have anything. I'm gonna have to have one. I don't I don't want to catch the alligator
[4813.78s -> 4817.25s]  Cast it like okay. See there's a fish right there
[4817.95s -> 4826.27s]  All right
[4827.47s -> 4832.68s]  Okay, I got one take it out
[4833.68s -> 4839.16s]  Do you yeah, you have to actually catch it though. Hang on. I'm gonna catch yours. No get out of here
[4839.84s -> 4845.32s]  Doesn't look like you have one to me. I do it's just like I don't know. I'm trying to reel it in
[4845.32s -> 4853.65s]  I'm holding right right trigger. I know it's it's right click. Whatever. Come on. Get over here. Hey
[4854.39s -> 4856.39s]  You snap the line fuck
[4858.21s -> 4874.97s]  Fish I got one. Wait, is it toggled? Is that the problem? Is that all right, please don't tell me that's it's not the problem
[4875.25s -> 4877.49s]  Is it cuz I have a toggled?
[4877.49s -> 4889.25s]  He's holding right click permanently. You might be no no way, right? Yep. That's what's happening toggle fishing
[4893.12s -> 4897.44s]  It's freaking me out because like it's such a far. How far can you cast the line?
[4898.32s -> 4902.48s]  No way. Nobody's gonna do it that far
[4904.00s -> 4915.95s]  How do you okay? Like I got another one, but I got I see that see the lightning. Yeah, I saw the lightning
[4916.39s -> 4920.85s]  How do you get them to actually bite? You got to like lure him in you got to like kind of wait
[4920.85s -> 4922.85s]  They'll come over you'll see a little bit of water
[4923.29s -> 4927.49s]  Yeah, and then can we get okay? I'm done. This is I fucking hate. This is stupid
[4927.65s -> 4931.29s]  I'm fucking done with this stupid ass god damn minigame. It sucks. Put it away. I'm done
[4933.57s -> 4935.57s]  I'm done. I don't do this. Oh
[4939.72s -> 4947.14s]  What a flop
[4947.14s -> 4949.14s]  He struck my lightning speech you give I
[4950.26s -> 4955.42s]  Can't put the fishing pole away. I know yeah, I think you have to go into your like actual inventory and like it holds queue
[4955.90s -> 4959.92s]  Like me once we blasted through Castillo's blockade
[4961.86s -> 4967.58s]  Well neat neither of us catch the fear no, but it's all right you have to um, however the level of skill up
[4968.10s -> 4972.71s]  What are they gonna make like gamer mouse that has rumble? Oh
[4973.31s -> 4976.14s]  That would be awful
[4976.14s -> 4980.75s]  Do you hold desk would vibrate?
[4981.27s -> 4983.27s]  It would just be like I
[4983.55s -> 4988.64s]  Would shake into your arm and it would shake all through your desk and your monitors
[4988.64s -> 4992.40s]  That's why I can't tell when I caught a fish because it was like I couldn't tell the difference between a nibble and bike
[4993.16s -> 5002.20s]  Hey, I need rumble on my mouse. We have to blow this stuff up. I still legitimately don't know how to put this fishing route away
[5002.96s -> 5008.82s]  Yeah, here we go you hold Q. All right, so we have to be careful because we're we're about to um, I
[5009.34s -> 5016.51s]  Don't know if that person sees us or I don't I think that person is hot. Is this hot? No, this is our car. Oh
[5017.57s -> 5019.57s]  I was wondering what the hell they were doing
[5022.09s -> 5025.01s]  They just like they just like drop the car
[5025.01s -> 5027.01s]  In front
[5029.21s -> 5030.97s]  Okay, this was a
[5030.97s -> 5037.24s]  Do you have anything this guy just has a hat and like a t-shirt and like boots
[5037.72s -> 5041.12s]  We need to get this guy like a weapon. He's in the middle of like a car. All right, where are you going?
[5041.56s -> 5054.40s]  That's my chance. I need uh, I need help. I need a hero
[5062.67s -> 5074.28s]  Dude, thanks work. All right, let's go. We have to destroy that with explosives. You see this guy. I heard that guy
[5074.96s -> 5082.01s]  You look I'm gonna lean out and snipe. It's out of here
[5083.64s -> 5088.04s]  What's the what are we even supposed to do to destroy the um, like the big auntie? Uh, oh
[5088.56s -> 5098.70s]  I shot that guy to another dimension, dude. I had to throw that guy in his right ear. So hard. There's pull them
[5098.70s -> 5104.12s]  Okay, we got one. Oh my god
[5108.05s -> 5110.05s]  Put out fire what's five
[5116.79s -> 5118.96s]  This guy is yours
[5121.28s -> 5123.28s]  I got to revive the croc
[5123.64s -> 5127.60s]  What do you imagine you get burnt and you're like, oh should I know duct tape that'll do it?
[5129.24s -> 5131.24s]  Have you ever seen duct tape burn before?
[5134.32s -> 5143.81s]  All right, so I that happened way too quickly you just drove into that exploded and now we have to do another one
[5144.45s -> 5146.63s]  Yeah, get the loot though
[5147.11s -> 5149.60s]  Could be a toy in here. That's right. There's loot
[5150.20s -> 5160.62s]  Edison's if you do you does it like share between us? I don't know. It's a good question
[5161.30s -> 5168.14s]  Probably, okay 500 meters that way. How about
[5169.10s -> 5184.52s]  We need a boat. I feel like if we swim I'm gonna get you down there. You doomed what?
[5189.19s -> 5190.35s]  Sorry

[5198.13s -> 5211.21s]  Wait, try a little bit closer until you're left. Where what's the plan here? What are you? What are you doing? I'm
[5212.25s -> 5217.18s]  What's wrong with me? You just water deeper. This is water toxic. What's going on?
[5218.50s -> 5220.50s]  What's wrong with me? Can you see me?
[5221.14s -> 5223.90s]  Yeah, what am I doing? Why I'm like, why am I can't breathe?
[5224.58s -> 5229.26s]  Hold on. I'm not drowning them up my heads above water. I think I think it's a good time to try the minigame
[5229.90s -> 5247.69s]  Yeah, I can stand up here. Why would I be drowning? I can stand here. Nice. All right, that just scared the shit out of me
[5247.69s -> 5249.57s]  I thought that was a fucking monster

[5472.11s -> 5487.23s]  Could they okay Guapo this little pound the bag. Did you say we should shoot the light out?
[5487.79s -> 5497.79s]  Yeah, shoot the light out of life. I can't tell this drop on bullets. I saw it done in one of the trailers
[5497.79s -> 5501.41s]  Just keep shooting. He's ready. Should I actually do there?
[5510.91s -> 5513.15s]  I'm close to Castillo ships
[5519.27s -> 5521.27s]  I want to hear
[5522.11s -> 5524.11s]  the ships
[5526.43s -> 5528.99s]  Like the thon
[5540.02s -> 5542.02s]  Okay, I love this comment
[5542.54s -> 5543.98s]  What he said
[5543.98s -> 5546.42s]  It's the house from the gamma
[5546.78s -> 5551.66s]  Correction screen and I know exactly what you're talking about
[5551.94s -> 5558.92s]  You know, you know what you get that right like adjust the brightness until you can see this but you can't see that
[5558.92s -> 5566.20s]  Yeah, it is the gamma correction screen. Why would you even catch that? What how much perceptive are you? It's crazy
[5567.12s -> 5574.14s]  There's a death. I
[5574.18s -> 5579.59s]  Shoot somebody from here. All right, we got to go up to the top of the lighthouse thing
[5587.84s -> 5594.44s]  Wait a second, but I love that like Far Cry became so famous for jumping puzzles
[5594.56s -> 5600.24s]  For tall things that they're like, yeah, fuck it. Let's just have them climb a rope to the top like
[5601.04s -> 5603.68s]  Just skip everything. No more climbing just pull
[5608.25s -> 5610.25s]  We don't have time for these puzzles anymore
[5616.27s -> 5623.78s]  Okay, I thought this is a bad guy look before you leap all right clear the ship of both clear both ships
[5624.50s -> 5634.90s]  If Lita was here, I'd kick her ass for keeping your secret. We have to parachute over
[5635.38s -> 5637.30s]  We I was gonna just snipe them
[5637.30s -> 5643.26s]  You want me to try to give you support over to watch?
[5643.62s -> 5648.90s]  I already I already did a stealth mission you it's your turn. You want me to do the stealth mission part. I
[5649.66s -> 5652.14s]  Mean dude, whatever. However, you want to do it? Okay, I'll try
[5652.82s -> 5661.06s]  You have a sniper rifle. I've got um, okay. Okay, I can like mark waypoints for you. Okay, so
[5661.78s -> 5664.94s]  Yeah, I'm gonna try to stealth over there. So we have to clear both ships
[5666.86s -> 5670.54s]  Yeah, just do one though. You don't have to do both. I'll come over after you to the closest one
[5671.02s -> 5679.08s]  I don't think this I don't think this is enough
[5682.34s -> 5684.71s]  Are you hoping W yes
[5691.24s -> 5695.56s]  Like I think it's okay because it's a thing to get up over here
[5701.03s -> 5709.07s]  Poggle parachute if I'm not gonna attack my shark, that's all I care about. I didn't see anybody on the first boat
[5709.59s -> 5712.39s]  There's a camera. There's a guy right here
[5713.19s -> 5725.10s]  Ladder I wouldn't go in you. Oh, you found the second ladder. I'm on board
[5727.40s -> 5731.28s]  And don't be afraid of using their own weapons against them. That's what I was about to do
[5733.16s -> 5740.20s]  Okay, you got a good view
[5740.20s -> 5743.69s]  Can you see my waypoints?

[5776.82s -> 5782.94s]  Three guys in this little boat courtyard trying to dump the person over the edge. They're coming back
[5784.50s -> 5791.50s]  I'm trying to throw the guy over the edge. The sun's getting in my eyes. Oh somebody somebody's up top

[5971.02s -> 5974.14s]  I mean, it's not like it really matters. I think doesn't really go that far
[5974.70s -> 5981.78s]  This is seriously what a place like it was just like pub G
[5982.30s -> 5995.21s]  Two people just fucking shooting and missing over and over again. What happened like okay us sitting here sniping is like a shitty prices
[5995.57s -> 5998.49s]  Sequel, okay. Somebody is hitting us from somewhere. I don't know
[5999.49s -> 6004.88s]  One dude's shooting RPGs from the lighthouse
[6007.42s -> 6009.42s]  He's hitting us
[6009.46s -> 6019.54s]  Fuck you Danny. He's talking to be talking about us. No, there's still people on this one
[6020.06s -> 6023.39s]  Did we clear it yet? I
[6029.61s -> 6036.03s]  Think we can parachute out. This is not clear though. It's still somebody on here. Oh, he's over here. I've got a half a power shirt
[6038.28s -> 6040.28s]  They forgot to mention that there's about
[6040.96s -> 6043.48s]  staff of 150 people per boat
[6046.44s -> 6048.68s]  There's too many people
[6050.61s -> 6052.98s]  They brought a helicopter
[6062.68s -> 6088.46s]  They got him oh my god, how many did you shoot the hell that's our helicopter
[6090.66s -> 6092.66s]  It is yeah, I

[6234.98s -> 6250.28s]  I'm looking at you
[6251.16s -> 6253.16s]  Break your legs
[6253.52s -> 6257.48s]  Like a shattering sound that was so loud. I
[6259.36s -> 6262.48s]  Love how it was like at 14 frames a second. Oh
[6263.00s -> 6265.59s]  Hey, wait, here's the bad guy. Here's the bad guy. This guy we have to kill
[6266.19s -> 6269.90s]  I'm gonna fucking move this guy

[6283.66s -> 6287.75s]  He's dead. Good job
[6288.07s -> 6296.44s]  Alright, there can't be that many more. We've probably taken out most of the Navy
[6298.34s -> 6303.38s]  What about these guys? Yeah
[6312.75s -> 6322.98s]  Hey come a little earlier next time just like the cavalry
[6324.00s -> 6326.00s]  Showing up late and claiming all the credit
[6326.60s -> 6339.32s]  my game crashed
[6339.48s -> 6344.76s]  Did it what's happening? What the fuck is one of the two there's got to be like one guy left
[6345.52s -> 6347.60s]  That was okay. That was weird
[6348.24s -> 6359.70s]  I'm bored
[6360.66s -> 6366.21s]  Okay, it's okay. Where is this last person? I did it just get it
[6366.81s -> 6379.84s]  Yeah, we did it both ships clear to soldiers gorilla boats can now escape. Okay, and
[6381.48s -> 6383.91s]  Maybe we'll get picked up
[6388.71s -> 6391.14s]  Now you gotta wait for the cool down
[6401.82s -> 6403.06s]  Oh
[6403.06s -> 6413.85s]  I'm alive. Don't worry. What's the joke? How do we get off of this?
[6418.31s -> 6430.91s]  Reach Clara's boat. Oh, she's coming. We made it
[6435.75s -> 6443.50s]  You know one of these times we're gonna do that in the main characters bodies is gonna be lying on the ground. Oh shit
[6445.46s -> 6446.86s]  boat sequence
[6446.86s -> 6457.72s]  Holy shit. We just made it out of there to give you credit Clara fucking did it. We did it, Danny
[6457.90s -> 6461.62s]  That was the difference. What's your plan? What did she do? She didn't do shit
[6462.14s -> 6465.02s]  He came to rescue us for the boat jobs until we could scrape up some money
[6465.42s -> 6473.26s]  Open a body shop if the Yankee blockade taught us anything. It's how to keep things running when you got nothing. That's the dream
[6474.30s -> 6479.18s]  Sure, the Yankees might pay you to park their cars or pick their fruit, but you'll never be one of them
[6479.86s -> 6484.42s]  The American dream doesn't come in our color. Okay, if we're shitting on dreams
[6484.82s -> 6488.14s]  What are you going to do if you win? Who are the people in the boats back here?
[6488.62s -> 6491.54s]  The next president won't last six months before they are assassinated
[6492.22s -> 6497.22s]  Were they on the boat? They're in they're in fisher boats. You ever see Dunkirk? Whoa. Whoa
[6497.22s -> 6500.02s]  It's a vision Danny, but I'm not as naive look up
[6500.58s -> 6506.08s]  This revolution will free yada, but won't fix it when we take the capital yada will be burning
[6506.54s -> 6510.92s]  Will be civil war factions warlords born back in the sky birds
[6510.92s -> 6516.10s]  You just wait till birds get smart enough to do this shit and shape into like a like a middle finger or something
[6516.10s -> 6518.10s]  Just wait until they get that kind of sentience
[6522.98s -> 6528.38s]  That's why we're making drones they're just like birds but you have to do this more control
[6529.30s -> 6531.48s]  No one would choose this. No, Danny
[6532.34s -> 6539.94s]  Everyone who follows me who joins Libertad chooses this but you know, there's aren't real birds are drones
[6542.58s -> 6545.89s]  Fuck you
[6548.01s -> 6551.59s]  Maybe a fancy apron leave me out of your fantasies Clara. I
[6553.28s -> 6555.28s]  Want to look forward I don't like looking this way
[6556.04s -> 6563.34s]  You don't think that was like the camera where like we're doing like the joke where we're gonna crash and would not looking
[6564.54s -> 6575.89s]  I like that one. I know but like I don't I want to be in control of that not her. I think we got imprisoned
[6579.04s -> 6582.05s]  Oh
[6587.73s -> 6589.73s]  This one
[6594.78s -> 6602.37s]  Let's watch this one, oh man and a fake it can be hard to see I haven't even seen this actor on screen yet
[6602.37s -> 6603.97s]  So I kind of want to
[6603.97s -> 6612.02s]  Understands that loyalty country is key to his survival. Not justice not love not even family
[6612.66s -> 6616.98s]  loyalty vision that look on themselves
[6619.58s -> 6621.94s]  Fake yarn is love to be the outcasts
[6622.46s -> 6624.83s]  They are addicted to their surface perversions
[6625.39s -> 6632.91s]  Chaos lies like wild dogs, but what dogs can be broken. What's the subtitle? What's going on the subtitle and if
[6633.79s -> 6635.43s]  dog
[6635.43s -> 6639.03s]  Refuses like the last line goes to the top just in case you read really slow
[6643.62s -> 6649.99s]  It's not on the screen right now, it's a lot of words for that sentence
[6651.23s -> 6654.67s]  You imagine if you didn't like if you would on a different language
[6654.67s -> 6664.47s]  You didn't understand it and you thought this is all they said you would think like, oh wow, that's all they said here. Okay, let's see
[6669.62s -> 6671.80s]  Somebody's still saying
[6678.12s -> 6684.07s]  And if a dog refuses to break they will be no more steps and if a dog refuses to break
[6684.51s -> 6686.51s]  That's how each one of these is starting
[6686.51s -> 6693.90s]  Yeah, like the last words of the last sentence start the next line and if a dog refuses to break
[6707.57s -> 6712.42s]  That person's dead, you know what I mean? Like they always do that in movies and TV shows
[6712.42s -> 6716.90s]  Oh, I'm gonna have the butter the the pistol or the rifle and hit you in the head like 12 times
[6716.90s -> 6720.03s]  The person is a club if they're gonna like do that
[6735.68s -> 6739.40s]  After I keep my promises Danny you wanted a boat you got a book
[6739.64s -> 6747.08s]  It's a beautiful. This is the one subterranean missile launching the helicopter boat. Is it really you two are just gonna let me leave
[6747.68s -> 6752.12s]  Bullshit, you could have sold us out a long time ago. All right, so we get we kind of get what happens
[6761.93s -> 6763.93s]  I'm driving the book from back here
[6764.25s -> 6767.94s]  Yeah, where the engine block is are you trying?
[6768.58s -> 6774.17s]  Wait, are you fucking me? Are you actually driving? Are you driving? You're driving. I am you
[6778.45s -> 6792.01s]  Military presence increased your horn. I don't think there's a horn. Okay. Well, this was fun, but we'd have to go over here
[6793.81s -> 6796.85s]  Don't be okay
[6796.85s -> 6799.89s]  We're gonna get some you can respawn it a thousand times. It's
[6801.65s -> 6808.17s]  Cars respawn. Don't worry, man. They really cut the budget for this far crime. All right, I mean look at this boat
[6820.02s -> 6824.18s]  Wait, where is this? Yeah, he's just dig
[6825.18s -> 6832.65s]  Whatever. Wait, let's go over here. Like I swear to God that person is so if I put my mouth to the ground and went like
[6833.77s -> 6836.26s]  They'd probably hear us and I could be like
[6837.06s -> 6842.90s]  I could put my ear on the ground. They could yell it. I mean, that's how they communicated before cell phones. Oh
[6843.66s -> 6854.80s]  See, it's why this concrete nevermind. All right, let's work
[6858.52s -> 6860.36s]  All right, let's work
[6860.36s -> 6865.62s]  What's the what's the job?
[6865.62s -> 6870.80s]  Can you hear this? I don't hear anything. He's only giving the quest to me. Oh
[6875.52s -> 6892.18s]  I'm just gonna start taking stuff. Whatever. He said before we can do the next mission
[6892.18s -> 6901.30s]  We need to have the achievements for beating Far Cry 5. I'm a weapon too. All right. Look I'll get a new gun here
[6901.30s -> 6902.66s]  Let's put it on
[6902.66s -> 6903.58s]  attachments
[6903.58s -> 6911.96s]  Yeah, it looks good. I want to use this thing. It's what slot is it in?
[6912.16s -> 6916.04s]  He also said he needs both of us to do the Voss
[6916.88s -> 6920.59s]  definition of insanity line
[6920.99s -> 6922.99s]  This is the definition of insanity
[6923.51s -> 6931.86s]  Sorry, was that like the Shakespearean interpretation? It was me just saying it to move on and go
[6931.86s -> 6942.93s]  Oh, these if we get different supreme. Whoa, what are these weapons EMP pulse to knock over enemies?
[6944.00s -> 6951.33s]  Chaos by launching poison gas. I don't need to need to hear anything else. That's not that one. What is this one?
[6951.97s -> 6957.94s]  Resolve real quick Britain. I don't know what this thing is. I got the gas one
[6959.89s -> 6966.74s]  Which is a gas coffee? Yeah poison gas. Oh poison gas. Okay
[6967.06s -> 6976.57s]  Does that just equip no?
[6976.57s -> 6981.32s]  Resolver I'm like I want to go look out and see what this thing does which which I'll pick a different one
[6981.32s -> 6983.32s]  Which one did you get? I got the one that looks like a wrench
[6983.56s -> 6988.88s]  number two
[6988.88s -> 6990.88s]  Okay, without was it
[6991.04s -> 6996.55s]  Flamethrower. All right. That's the thing. I just got so what's this resolver of weapon? How do we use it?
[7005.48s -> 7009.80s]  You probably have to like go into the inventory and equip it in the armory
[7011.00s -> 7012.04s]  armory
[7012.04s -> 7014.21s]  Have to equip it. Oh
[7014.29s -> 7015.57s]  Arsenal
[7015.57s -> 7020.14s]  Like in your actual arsenal. Okay. Yeah, I see
[7022.52s -> 7030.79s]  What's the other thing do I don't I don't want the flamethrower anymore put this thing on it's a cross
[7030.79s -> 7035.72s]  I'm done with you. This might be kind of fun
[7036.93s -> 7040.31s]  Sounds like the Ubisoft people playing with the ad, you know what? Whatever
[7041.54s -> 7044.82s]  I'm gonna be wicked low fucking energy for the rest of stream. You ready? Okay. Ah
[7045.54s -> 7058.03s]  All right, dude, you ready? Let's go. I don't know you sure. Yeah, you really okay. Let's um, I got this cool thing here
[7058.03s -> 7059.11s]  So where we gonna go?
[7059.11s -> 7065.63s]  Yeah, actually I'm gonna take a shit for like 30 minutes and then I'm gonna go make some dinner
[7065.63s -> 7069.59s]  Then I'm gonna take my dog out and then I'm gonna run some errands and then I'll then I'll play co-op with you again
[7069.59s -> 7075.68s]  I promise. No, I'm good. I'm good. Um, I'll talk to you later, though
[7075.68s -> 7085.65s]  Like I'll talk to you like at some point. Thanks for playing. All right, we're gonna go over here
[7092.68s -> 7094.24s]  My was my chat. I can't see anything
[7094.24s -> 7098.02s]  Is there any that you can relate to more than?
[7098.32s -> 7103.56s]  Getting a co-op game with your friend and you guys play at one time and that you never play it again ever
[7104.64s -> 7106.64s]  Once you're back, it's every experience ever
[7107.48s -> 7116.95s]  Ammo new believers because you were surprised. Let's keep it that way. We need to know this. This is important
[7116.95s -> 7123.99s]  I still controls all of yada with soldados. I like that. They're all scrapbookers. The capital is a stronghold
[7123.99s -> 7128.91s]  It's good to have some hobbies. We free you can do when you're waiting for your friends to log on
[7128.91s -> 7133.47s]  So they'll play co-op with you again hit military targets like FND bases and checkpoints
[7133.75s -> 7135.75s]  This does look like a
[7140.03s -> 7145.40s]  Operations that will unite the revolution and make Libertad stronger to do that
[7145.40s -> 7150.92s]  I need you to recruit three groups in yada to fight with Libertad each is waging war across
[7154.08s -> 7156.08s]  What are these subtitles I should turn these off
[7164.98s -> 7169.58s]  Poison lifeline you guys get this game. I hope you enjoy these islands
[7171.30s -> 7173.30s]  Other places
[7175.54s -> 7180.82s]  This is the demo we're giving you the demo of the game so you can decide if you want to buy it or not
[7180.82s -> 7182.82s]  Because you're not gonna see any of these places
[7185.46s -> 7187.46s]  Are we going here right now
[7190.10s -> 7192.10s]  There's like a leader in each zone
[7194.40s -> 7200.16s]  Counter-propaganda campaign and for some reason be like HQ of the resistance is right in the
[7206.72s -> 7208.72s]  Was saying this is really confusing
[7209.32s -> 7213.32s]  Well, we're not making this any easier. We're skipping every cutscene and run
[7213.84s -> 7215.84s]  We're not making it really easy for you to pay attention
[7217.40s -> 7222.98s]  But the Montero family is waging war against Jose they hate visitors
[7222.98s -> 7228.26s]  But I even tell on a mechanic who has a workshop in Costa del Mar his name is Philly Barca
[7228.26s -> 7233.30s]  And he's their gatekeeper. Okay, can we get a helicopter and just fly to the leaders?
[7241.30s -> 7246.68s]  I'll be here actioning targeted Libertad strikes against Castillo throughout yada
[7247.08s -> 7251.81s]  Hang on. I'm going to get all these groups to sign up to Libertad by myself
[7252.45s -> 7259.43s]  How simple you help we're gonna get a change dot org petition going there's a lot of people we have to go get
[7259.47s -> 7266.18s]  We're gonna get a lot of these. There's a lot of people here. I send a squad to these groups
[7266.18s -> 7269.58s]  I'm an invader. I send a scout then I'm not serious with you
[7269.66s -> 7276.22s]  They get my best career without politics and bullshit just help Libertad takes the capital we slid and on throat
[7276.22s -> 7291.40s]  We got a pretty good idea. Oh, I try to walk. I tried to skip earlier. Oh, we have a real boat. Oh
[7291.56s -> 7295.11s]  Oh
[7295.11s -> 7299.63s]  Okay, now we're talking now. We're actually are talking meet the legends, okay
[7300.23s -> 7308.48s]  Meet the Monteros. Oh god. This did just open up. All right. We won't go first
[7308.48s -> 7314.84s]  Uh, yeah, I think I think we can go wherever extra content now available
[7315.36s -> 7334.18s]  You can go up down. What do you think? Hold on. I have a new friend Pete the Elbertson's
[7335.02s -> 7345.32s]  Where's my new friend? What do you mean new friend? I have a new buddy somewhere
[7345.32s -> 7356.13s]  Oh, we can call for our boats now. Oh, yeah. Okay
[7357.47s -> 7361.91s]  Do you want to get in the boat? Just let's go this way. Yeah, what do I have? Okay, hold on
[7361.91s -> 7366.83s]  I did you buy this game because I didn't buy it. I did the like Ubisoft
[7367.83s -> 7369.91s]  subscription thing for like one month I
[7371.03s -> 7373.12s]  What is that?
[7373.12s -> 7375.12s]  they you know, like like
[7375.48s -> 7379.16s]  EA play yeah, and apparently it
[7380.00s -> 7386.56s]  Unlocks like every premium thing so hold on but to show you how ridiculous this shit is what hold on
[7386.60s -> 7390.07s]  I'm about to do like a sea of thieves cosmetic
[7390.75s -> 7396.89s]  You have like a Kano I hold on it hasn't I haven't even finished yet
[7396.89s -> 7404.51s]  How much do you hold on I need you to while you're doing that?
[7404.51s -> 7408.45s]  I need you to explain to me very slowly so I can keep up and understand you
[7408.77s -> 7415.13s]  You're paying a monthly subscription to Ubisoft to play like three games that come out. No, no, no, you must understand
[7416.13s -> 7419.95s]  Dollars so I could play this for one stream and then I'm just gonna unsubscribe
[7420.53s -> 7426.01s]  Before the next month charges me. Okay, but but is that what the service is?
[7426.21s -> 7434.44s]  It's to like play Ubisoft games like as a subscription. Yeah, that's that seem that's it. That's impossible
[7434.44s -> 7438.23s]  I don't believe you. That's what I mean. They gave me the super look at my look at my hand
[7438.23s -> 7440.85s]  I have a robot hand. Hold on. Hold on
[7442.05s -> 7451.79s]  What is it doing? No, no behind you what?
[7452.35s -> 7457.31s]  It has a QR code around its collar really
[7467.10s -> 7473.20s]  So it's $15 a month and you get to play any Ubisoft game you want I guess yeah
[7473.20s -> 7477.88s]  why are you saying it like we're doing a sponsored segment because I'm trying to understand because
[7478.44s -> 7486.15s]  You can get every Ubisoft game that probably ever came out on like sales. Oh, I also apparently unlock like
[7487.15s -> 7491.37s]  New weapons. How many new weapons did I get?
[7495.14s -> 7497.26s]  This really is like use my cheat code
[7497.26s -> 7502.38s]  I'm the guy standing behind the person cooking the food in the infomercial going now. Hold on a second Kathy
[7502.38s -> 7508.22s]  You're hold on you're telling me that this can cook rice and can cook chicken at the same time. Explain that to me
[7508.22s -> 7510.22s]  I don't understand
[7510.54s -> 7518.79s]  What the okay this game sucks, this is stupid. I hate this. I don't like it anymore. I don't like this game anymore
[7518.79s -> 7520.71s]  I got a Winchester
[7520.71s -> 7524.97s]  Get out of here get it with you or with your Ubisoft subscription character
[7526.35s -> 7528.35s]  It's not this stupid not fair. I
[7529.15s -> 7536.92s]  Paid $60 for this game. How much did you pay for it again? Explain it again plated scorpion. This was $15
[7536.92s -> 7542.00s]  Yeah, I guess I paid three top four times as much as you did for this game
[7542.72s -> 7551.58s]  Okay, but I mean nothing stopping you from getting premium currency and just going ahead and buying it to adding these cosmetic items to your game
[7552.38s -> 7558.36s]  What the hell that's you could just pay you could just pay more and then you could unlock them permanently
[7565.28s -> 7569.68s]  You were supposed to buy the $200 edition. I am so confused. I didn't think that was a thing
[7569.68s -> 7574.84s]  Is that why they made their own launcher? Is that why they really like leaned into the like the you play connect thing?
[7576.24s -> 7582.60s]  That's probably just because steam takes like 20% of the profit on everything but but didn't we did I bought this?
[7582.60s -> 7584.60s]  Oh my god, what happened?
[7585.76s -> 7595.22s]  Okay, there are two objects in the ocean that could possibly be hit
[7596.22s -> 7598.78s]  Yes, and you have hit both of them
[7599.94s -> 7607.50s]  Statistic statistically if you use the whole service area, it's like a zero point zero zero zero one percent chance to hit those boats. I
[7608.02s -> 7614.23s]  Am still so fucking I'm floored by this whole Ubisoft thing. I'm sorry. I just am I
[7614.67s -> 7620.76s]  Mean you could you could probably access the the you play shop in the game. I bet because you couldn't Assassin's Creed
[7622.16s -> 7626.35s]  How many games does Ubisoft think they're gonna release I
[7628.40s -> 7639.23s]  Don't I don't know that wasn't even my only costume. I have three how many games is Ubisoft release a year?
[7641.18s -> 7643.18s]  three four maybe
[7659.72s -> 7663.56s]  The cyberpunk one was pretty this one's gonna make you mad too, but for a different reason
[7669.00s -> 7671.30s]  What are you doing more crazy things now
[7672.56s -> 7679.66s]  What you get like a cool I?
[7679.74s -> 7686.84s]  Get I you get like laser cannons and cool costumes and I get like a fucking crossbow that was made out of a toaster
[7687.32s -> 7691.92s]  Okay, let's go
[7691.92s -> 7700.56s]  We need a car
[7700.56s -> 7706.04s]  Listen, okay. Well, I just want to be clear. We're trying to usurp the government
[7706.64s -> 7713.28s]  While also taking part in beautiful capitalism. I don't listen. Look at these look at these beautiful shoes in my watch
[7713.92s -> 7715.92s]  Solid gold
[7716.36s -> 7720.24s]  Let's go
[7720.56s -> 7728.62s]  Listen only the capital is gonna come up with this laser gun with magnetic reload. I just put the magazine
[7731.02s -> 7733.02s]  Also that guy doesn't get mad
[7734.66s -> 7737.43s]  Hey, why don't you use your like cool new gun on this guy?
[7739.07s -> 7744.37s]  That's so I did you is it $15 to get loud I just met this lady
[7748.93s -> 7752.27s]  Why do I have the option what is happening?
[7759.23s -> 7766.10s]  Why okay, I was so confused your gun is too loud, I don't care how much it cost
[7771.02s -> 7773.02s]  Get this lady out here
[7775.18s -> 7782.96s]  Get we gotta get with this lady's a fucking menace we gotta get over this wrong person
[7785.96s -> 7794.75s]  That's the quest what the hell you're don't I don't like they're too loud
[7794.75s -> 7799.98s]  If you paid more money to be louder than me, nobody's louder than me
[7799.98s -> 7802.86s]  I'm one of the loudest most annoying streamers on Twitch. Don't you get it?
[7802.86s -> 7806.48s]  You know, I don't be able to be badly be a little louder than me. Oh, what does this do?
[7829.07s -> 7833.39s]  I don't know. Maybe this is the fact that there was an explosion that happened five feet away from me
[7833.91s -> 7837.68s]  We have to make contact with Philly
[7839.09s -> 7841.09s]  Shit
[7841.17s -> 7844.82s]  Okay, I'll use pay-to-win Robo dog
[7848.06s -> 7867.64s]  Okay, are you ready? I just like gassed everybody
[7869.28s -> 7873.08s]  I don't know. I don't have a I don't have a horse somehow and that may him
[7873.08s -> 7875.76s]  Yeah, I want you want to go get a robot one from the fucking store
[7876.72s -> 7879.11s]  It probably is one rockets on its back
[7881.15s -> 7883.40s]  Hold on did I get a super rocket too? I
[7884.40s -> 7891.00s]  Think we can probably I think we can take this over
[7891.28s -> 7899.42s]  There's a helicopter here dude, we have to take this place out. Let's do this slowly and actually methodically. Let's actually do it
[7899.42s -> 7901.42s]  Okay, really? There's a helicopter right here
[7902.56s -> 7908.22s]  Actually sneak and do this correctly. Okay, I'll uh, I'll do some spying
[7919.86s -> 7921.86s]  Sure
[7921.86s -> 7932.70s]  That's quite a climb for and claim this is there anybody up on this tower
[7935.08s -> 7941.20s]  I don't know. There are a couple people it looks pretty open. There's just guy on the roof
[7941.70s -> 7943.22s]  Is there a guy but there's a guy on the roof?
[7943.22s -> 7946.74s]  How do I get up on that's not none of the not of that building. There's a guy on the roof
[7947.10s -> 7949.18s]  To your right. Let me get up there. Oh
[7950.91s -> 7956.18s]  Okay. Yeah, I don't know that that guy just I don't know this guy's doing but
[7956.74s -> 7962.58s]  You're asking you about shooting somebody on a ladder. Well, that guy wasn't technically on a ladder
[7962.98s -> 7985.61s]  All right, I'm just gonna go over here. I think this they see you getting in the helicopter. I'm gonna try to cover you
[7986.25s -> 7989.24s]  It said anti aircraft covers the skies
[7990.06s -> 7998.19s]  I'll go up. Oh shit. Don't take a picture with you fucking good. What?
[7998.97s -> 8008.60s]  Good doesn't look like it. Oh

[8067.77s -> 8068.89s]  I
[8068.89s -> 8075.53s]  Think this is just a random outpost. I think we can actually do something here, right like turn off. Okay, hold on interact
[8076.13s -> 8078.31s]  Here we go. All right access chopper. I
[8079.48s -> 8084.80s]  literally pressed Q W P O Q L P O P O Q W 1 2 0 0 5
[8085.32s -> 8088.24s]  That's what I pressed. I didn't I don't even know what in buttons
[8088.24s -> 8091.72s]  I just pressed random ones about my password in chat after giving up everything that's happened recently
[8093.12s -> 8096.23s]  It's connecting
[8096.23s -> 8105.16s]  Okay connecting
[8105.16s -> 8115.74s]  Alright, is it still connecting? Where's the mouse? Yeah, where's the mouse?
[8116.34s -> 8118.42s]  How long is it to connect?
[8118.42s -> 8131.89s]  Nobody's coughing in here. All right, let's go through glass. Oh, that's not good. There's a helicopter. I know this is a helicopter
[8131.89s -> 8136.24s]  I've been trying to shoot the pilot out. I like hacked this thing, but I don't know if it's doing anything
[8136.80s -> 8139.04s]  It says connected. Oh
[8139.28s -> 8145.78s]  What's down here? I'm gonna blow up the helicopter before I kill this guy
[8146.42s -> 8149.23s]  Um, I just went underground
[8149.63s -> 8154.11s]  Wait, where's my pay-to-win sniper?
[8154.19s -> 8167.89s]  It's just things I feel like I'm watching the intro of a TV show. So much shit is on the top left of my screen
[8168.65s -> 8175.30s]  It's as if it's telling me who like made the game and shit. What it looked like. Are you dead? I went like down. I
[8177.10s -> 8179.10s]  Like come collecting like military
[8179.62s -> 8186.22s]  Ingredients, I don't know whatever it is. I went down. There's a little building can go in and I went down into the basement

[8229.19s -> 8230.59s]  Wouldn't be surprised
[8230.59s -> 8233.99s]  Bunker key card. Come on. They got me something cool here
[8234.95s -> 8236.95s]  There's about six people on my corpse
[8237.03s -> 8245.02s]  What the fuck I I'm just coming up. I have no idea. There's a seven people on my body
[8247.29s -> 8262.82s]  Okay, I got a key card. Oh, you're dead. Okay, I'm helping. Oh my god. All right, you're any missiles or anything heavy
[8270.88s -> 8279.36s]  Hey, hey, what happened? Are you okay?

[8286.62s -> 8291.52s]  Shit, we're in trouble. There are two helicopters
[8291.98s -> 8294.80s]  Wow
[8294.80s -> 8298.54s]  I don't have any heels left either
[8298.54s -> 8308.11s]  What the fuck what ammo? I'm dead. Are you still alive?
[8308.67s -> 8311.42s]  moment momentarily
[8313.14s -> 8315.14s]  There's a nice slide
[8316.75s -> 8328.30s]  Yep. All right. I just smoked a cigar and put it out on my hand to kill myself. Oh
[8332.43s -> 8342.38s]  I did it. What's happening? Just shut the pilot finally. Oh, you got you got pilot. Nice. I
[8349.76s -> 8351.76s]  Knocked the helmet off
[8352.35s -> 8356.69s]  No, not Robo dog. All right, I got Robo dog
[8370.98s -> 8378.89s]  All right, but what always what are we doing here? I got like a key card. Did we haven't liberated the place?
[8380.81s -> 8382.81s]  Objective telling you where to go
[8383.25s -> 8403.36s]  Nagging you. Oh, you have to just kill everybody. So where's the anti-air that like shoots the helicopters down?
[8403.64s -> 8407.83s]  I think we just claimed it. Maybe when this cycles back, we'll get access to the helicopter
[8410.85s -> 8411.85s]  helicopter
[8411.85s -> 8413.57s]  Come on, please. Oh
[8413.57s -> 8417.47s]  Yeah, we got it. What do we we did? Oh
[8419.10s -> 8423.38s]  Helicopter inbound. Oh
[8423.38s -> 8425.38s]  Hell yeah, finally
[8427.82s -> 8431.02s]  The guilt finally caught up with me you buying more
[8433.08s -> 8436.28s]  No, I've just been using
[8436.64s -> 8439.50s]  I've just been using the ones that I already had
[8441.46s -> 8444.18s]  This is restricted airspace, so we have to get the hell out of here fast
[8444.82s -> 8449.70s]  It's we just captured it. It's ours. Apparently it's not a bear. I guess not
[8450.34s -> 8454.01s]  Wait, can you are you over here? Can you get in here? Yeah, one sec
[8454.53s -> 8468.30s]  Nice. All right, where someone's noticing us. How do you fly?
[8469.06s -> 8470.86s]  We've been seen by
[8470.86s -> 8471.94s]  Nope
[8471.94s -> 8487.90s]  Just trying to get out of the airspace. All right. Hell. Yeah, that's kind of sad that our
[8488.66s -> 8490.22s]  guapos are
[8490.22s -> 8493.48s]  They'll catch up running
[8493.72s -> 8497.24s]  All right, let me get the controls here
[8499.30s -> 8502.78s]  So it's just forward back left right and then it's space control
[8503.42s -> 8511.48s]  Kate 9000 just died. So I guess they weren't fine. How do I turn? Oh, I have to actually be okay
[8511.48s -> 8529.39s]  I'm gonna get a free look. All right, let's go. Let's fly to the mission. Let's try not to break this
[8529.79s -> 8537.23s]  You look you just went to a rave. I do you look like you just went to like Burning Man. I
[8538.11s -> 8553.01s]  Don't know why I thought that said e exit vehicle slash freak out I'm gonna try to do this very carefully
[8553.61s -> 8556.29s]  What kind of person works in a place like this? Oh
[8562.85s -> 8568.98s]  I didn't get it landed. Where's he just a fucking lose it
[8571.84s -> 8576.51s]  Exactly what I would have done. I like this character
[8587.54s -> 8593.76s]  Really said she was seen at the tobacco plantation. All right, let's go. What what happened to the chopper? I don't know
[8594.20s -> 8599.34s]  It's apparently gone. It's not to make do with this
[8600.28s -> 8608.79s]  If you bring this vehicle to a pickup point, you can call it in whenever you want. I can use can you slash DMCA?
[8614.83s -> 8617.96s]  The plane
[8619.72s -> 8629.64s]  Or on to the next toy, that's all we care about. Oh wow a toy we both get in this
[8630.32s -> 8635.24s]  This is back. You're in the back. You're yeah, you're the pie. I'm facing backwards
[8635.72s -> 8642.82s]  Okay, how do I fly it?
[8642.82s -> 8645.30s]  restricted airspace is on your radar
[8646.60s -> 8653.28s]  Accelerate the accelerate. Yeah, and then pitch. Um, I don't know what that does
[8653.88s -> 8658.44s]  Holy fucking smokes, dude. Are you kidding me?
[8659.44s -> 8661.16s]  We actually just do that
[8661.16s -> 8663.16s]  from a takeoff
[8663.28s -> 8665.28s]  This is a vertical takeoff and landing
[8666.96s -> 8671.32s]  Itch and yaw, what's this? I'm trying
[8681.49s -> 8683.49s]  Now is a plantation
[8686.05s -> 8700.95s]  Press E to shoot who is she after? Oh fuck we're gonna get fired. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry
[8712.02s -> 8716.30s]  I'm sorry. That was it. That was a full-on painful. Yeah, that was a big one
[8731.46s -> 8735.37s]  Yes, I do I am I am Iron Man one. Oh
[8738.56s -> 8743.59s]  My god, that's all it does. Oh, what is that? Oh
[8751.74s -> 8753.74s]  Whose plane is this?
[8763.93s -> 8769.00s]  Okay, I'm out of ammo. We got him. No. Oh
[8770.35s -> 8771.87s]  They're coming back
[8771.87s -> 8779.97s]  What was that?
[8779.97s -> 8782.45s]  Hold on. I've got like booby traps
[8783.09s -> 8791.68s]  Plane is just freaking out up there. This plane is freaking me out. I
[8793.56s -> 8795.24s]  Out or something
[8795.24s -> 8805.41s]  Well plane is gone
[8805.93s -> 8810.56s]  Plane just did a flip. Okay, we'll get another one planes actually upside down. Well done
[8810.56s -> 8819.83s]  There's a supply drop whoever is in that plane right now is and puked their guts out like five times
[8820.31s -> 8837.15s]  It's no way you're gonna keep doing that. So what is this another outpost or just like I think this is another outpost
[8837.61s -> 8843.92s]  This is a good person. I'm pretty sure the laser. Oh
[8845.27s -> 8851.33s]  Okay, I don't know. I thought that was a friendly. It's like a bunker
[8851.57s -> 8857.91s]  No, this is like a little bunker like we probably claim it though. Do we have to destroy stuff?
[8857.91s -> 8859.95s]  didn't the thing said destroy things and you'll I
[8862.11s -> 8865.95s]  Swear to god. I was like destroy. I'll try to machete the likes
[8868.11s -> 8873.14s]  That's a good question just break shit
[8874.18s -> 8880.84s]  Clearly looks like we can take this it does but I don't think there's anything here. Oh
[8885.00s -> 8898.74s]  That was a UFO. I wasn't even playing guided missile. All right. Well, I guess we have to go over here
[8904.74s -> 8907.24s]  Oh lower it
[8912.95s -> 8922.51s]  I'm pulling like glass out of my body. Lower your crock lower your crocodile now
[8924.91s -> 8935.98s]  No guapo
[8935.98s -> 8943.17s]  Are we back in the in the like tobacco field? I gotta get guapo. Yeah, we're back in the tobacco places
[8943.57s -> 8947.16s]  Come on guapo. Wait, who are you?
[8947.52s -> 8964.06s]  This person have five hundred thousand help maybe a little overkill
[8964.46s -> 8976.54s]  Yeah, you get over here I'm okay
[8977.50s -> 8994.48s]  Well, I was all right. All right guapo. You're good. Where are my other gadgets? There's a really weird sound that just came out of your dog
[8995.80s -> 9003.69s]  It's some like grease in his joints. I bet you he gets struck by lightning
[9005.48s -> 9017.19s]  Nope another helicopter person. I cannot kill. Okay, like I'm in dress pants doing this like
[9019.81s -> 9022.88s]  It's like a thousand dollar suit and you just slide around
[9025.59s -> 9037.18s]  Hey, is there like a player three in here because these guys are all already dead
[9037.18s -> 9042.27s]  I feel like we did this already like when we are thanks for burning me with your cool
[9043.03s -> 9047.11s]  Jetpack that will never happen. By the way, there will never be a jetpack
[9047.99s -> 9055.50s]  Ever never gonna happen. Oh, I get to do boosts and you leave a wake of fire behind you that's hurting us
[9055.94s -> 9068.80s]  We talked about like Oh flying cars jetpacks. Nope. No when you add the other axis
[9069.52s -> 9076.68s]  Not just left and right but up and down and for you know, they understand how insane that would be if they were flying cars
[9080.09s -> 9087.01s]  People would be able to use the Y & Z axis to pass you on the road, which is in the air
[9089.59s -> 9096.03s]  There'd be a car there would be a flying car accident every like there'd be 50,000 flying car accidents every one second
[9096.47s -> 9106.02s]  If you think that that like dick behind you that is just riding your ass while you're going the speed limit on the highway
[9106.24s -> 9108.60s]  If you don't think that the fat guy has a Y & Z axis
[9108.60s -> 9113.28s]  He's not gonna fucking crash with this first time he drives that car you get twice as many lanes though
[9113.44s -> 9118.08s]  Instead of just horizontal you get vertical lanes. So they got more space. They have more room
[9118.64s -> 9121.90s]  When there's 50,000 cars on the road think of how many cars are in the highway?
[9122.52s -> 9126.77s]  Yeah, but it's like are there more people in this timeline or the same amount of people
[9126.85s -> 9131.01s]  This same amount of people think about when you drive down the road how many cars you are around?
[9131.09s -> 9133.09s]  Imagine if they could just be anywhere in the sky
[9138.36s -> 9142.16s]  Listen to me that sounds like you're stifling progress people said that about cars to it
[9142.16s -> 9145.40s]  They're like, you know, there's so many horses. What if a lot of people added like cars to this?
[9145.40s -> 9147.40s]  They're gonna run over the horses
[9147.40s -> 9151.36s]  We're all still on the same axis though. You're not adding an axis by having a horse to a car
[9151.96s -> 9158.55s]  Hey, they wouldn't they share the same plane
[9164.66s -> 9167.22s]  Skip that skip it now
[9180.17s -> 9183.05s]  Sounds like James Gunn worked hard on this
[9184.57s -> 9186.57s]  Rehired and that's the best he could do
[9187.01s -> 9189.01s]  Circumstances with all the mental anguish. Oh
[9190.47s -> 9191.87s]  Here we go
[9191.87s -> 9194.24s]  fight fight
[9208.87s -> 9217.45s]  Well run does
[9224.06s -> 9225.78s]  They're all
[9225.78s -> 9233.58s]  Is the game too loud? I feel like they was excruciatingly loud. It's louder now. I feel like right now. Yeah, it definitely got louder
[9234.86s -> 9249.14s]  I can't aim this gun that far. Why are they attacking this?
[9250.90s -> 9255.49s]  What did you see that?
[9255.93s -> 9261.33s]  No, I was too busy spinning gas over there. What happened? I just traveled like 15 feet for that knife kill like
[9263.09s -> 9273.40s]  Take out the soldiers. All right, there's only I think there's only one more. I think it's still getting loud
[9273.80s -> 9285.35s]  It's that definitely is getting louder. Where's this last person? Oh, here comes a helicopter, of course
[9291.65s -> 9293.65s]  Helicopter coming in
[9294.09s -> 9298.53s]  I'm gonna throw an explosive barrel at the helicopter and you shoot it in nevermind
[9300.01s -> 9306.07s]  Oh, I just put gas out here this guy's taking off. He's like I'm out of here
[9310.26s -> 9318.12s]  Did you do that? Yeah, why did the car 15 times? I don't know
[9318.80s -> 9324.63s]  Watch out
[9324.63s -> 9329.92s]  Come on. Let me snipe him. Come on
[9330.44s -> 9339.89s]  Is it bulletproof? I was thinking earlier. I think it is
[9340.35s -> 9344.00s]  Yeah, this shit's bulletproof. I can't hear
[9361.76s -> 9378.00s]  You're gonna land I feel like he's going to land I was he hovering like
[9378.78s -> 9401.95s]  What about the mounted guns? Can you aim mount a gun that high? Yes. Whoa. He had more health than the helicopter
[9410.41s -> 9412.41s]  Just lying on the ground
[9422.98s -> 9424.98s]  Shield
[9425.10s -> 9430.48s]  What is this game? Okay, this one's actually not fatal it doesn't work
[9432.55s -> 9436.90s]  I shot right through it. It's a piece of cardboard
[9438.34s -> 9450.49s]  Hold that shield up. I want to see so hold on. Hold on. It doesn't actually work. It does it actually works
[9450.81s -> 9455.97s]  Listen, these are the same developers that made rainbow six, you know all the clips you see on Twitter
[9456.45s -> 9462.09s]  It's always the shield guy. He just walks into a room holds the shield up for 30 straight seconds. Everybody laughs
[9463.13s -> 9465.13s]  Josh you feet though
[9465.67s -> 9469.15s]  Hey, remember when like I played rainbow six season. I thought I was gonna like it
[9470.98s -> 9479.19s]  No, I was that might have been like the the game that I would hate the most. I remember rainbow siege
[9480.03s -> 9483.67s]  Rainbow six siege. Why are we saying rainbow siege rainbow six siege in
[9484.55s -> 9488.47s]  Alpha had forced open mic lobbies. Oh, yeah
[9489.07s -> 9494.19s]  That's so bad. You're okay. So everyone who was streaming it you just go into a lobby
[9494.19s -> 9498.15s]  It was like alright, they've got a guy in the next room. Yep. I'm gonna go ahead and put up my shield
[9498.15s -> 9500.15s]  Hey, hey, can we get some grenades in there?
[9500.51s -> 9501.71s]  Ah
[9501.71s -> 9506.57s]  It was actually the Ubisoft trailers. It really was the Ubisoft trailers people just talking
[9507.11s -> 9520.38s]  Yeah, people don't talk when they play co-op games. Usually I don't want people to hear me unrecorded
[9520.90s -> 9524.57s]  I've listened like but back when I would like used to make YouTube videos, right?
[9524.85s -> 9528.01s]  you did you'd record a bunch of stuff for like hours and hours at a time and
[9528.53s -> 9530.61s]  I don't know why I do this shit
[9530.61s -> 9535.33s]  But I just go like this when I know when no one's in the room and I'm just alone and like I'm not even aware
[9535.33s -> 9537.33s]  of it, I just go like this like
[9539.43s -> 9541.39s]  I just like sniff
[9541.39s -> 9543.91s]  every like two to three minutes, I'll just do like a
[9544.95s -> 9548.81s]  I don't I don't get it. I don't know why it just happens
[9550.88s -> 9557.34s]  I will listen to whole parts of recordings that were like 20 minutes of silence and beginning like gameplay and you just hear like
[9559.99s -> 9562.95s]  I feel like I'm now I'm sniffing right?
[9564.23s -> 9568.75s]  Yeah, see you just like it you were now on manual sniffing. I
[9569.75s -> 9572.95s]  Don't know what it is. It's like maybe it's like breathing in to like get up to
[9573.67s -> 9577.07s]  Stable my breath to shoot it something. I don't know. It's like weird
[9582.85s -> 9585.45s]  Yeah, I gotta go in and then it comes out
[9589.53s -> 9595.37s]  No, it's not like an irritation or like I have allergies or something in the room is bothering me or at my stuffy nose
[9595.37s -> 9597.37s]  No, it's just I just make a loud
[9597.77s -> 9599.77s]  Inhale noise every like few minutes
[9601.41s -> 9604.06s]  I
[9604.06s -> 9606.58s]  Think is kind of like an echo location for humans
[9607.50s -> 9612.66s]  It's like hey, I'm in this room. I was in your chat right now. I would be doing triple question marks in the chat
[9615.22s -> 9622.26s]  I think everybody's already used to it. It's like it's not it's actually not
[9625.24s -> 9627.52s]  Echolocation sniffing really loud to like
[9628.44s -> 9630.44s]  Yeah, so I let someone know you're coming
[9630.48s -> 9636.24s]  So if you're like walking down the hall and you think someone may not know that you're coming it's like, you know, like hey
[9636.24s -> 9637.88s]  I'm I'm on my way
[9637.88s -> 9639.88s]  Whatever you're doing in here better not be weird
[9640.28s -> 9642.56s]  Better not be weird embarrassing cuz here I come
[9643.76s -> 9647.80s]  That's so funny cuz like that's like I have no idea what you're talking
[9650.78s -> 9655.06s]  That was I actually he's right. Yeah true. Oh
[9657.10s -> 9658.70s]  That's so funny
[9658.70s -> 9664.66s]  But I can you know part of you probably is that is probably correct is you hear people kind of like
[9664.82s -> 9667.94s]  Mouth breathing and stuff when they're walking or you'll hear like
[9671.82s -> 9678.65s]  So that makes sense, yeah
[9683.62s -> 9689.36s]  Just not coming around that Dachshund I saw a doctor there is a doctor in this game with
[9691.74s -> 9712.45s]  Third we are in third person. I'm trying to capitalize on third person. This is a really weird build camp facilities
[9713.05s -> 9721.76s]  Okay, just like they can follow up for frame rates like worse than third person
[9721.76s -> 9726.95s]  I really don't think we're supposed to be in third person. I made contact with the motoros
[9728.47s -> 9734.15s]  Well Carlos wants nothing to do with me, but I get along with his daughter. I think she's my way in
[9734.35s -> 9736.35s]  You need to understand them
[9738.23s -> 9740.23s]  First step is understanding this camp
[9741.79s -> 9744.31s]  You need to become one of them
[9745.59s -> 9750.07s]  Yes, sorry coming here with my $4,000 suit try not to get my shoes dirty
[9750.07s -> 9755.19s]  Could you guys put me in the right direction to overthrow the revolution? I want the I want the Dachshund pet
[9758.78s -> 9760.58s]  I
[9760.58s -> 9765.18s]  Feel like this would be a really you would have an alligator right here next to like a Dachshund
[9765.18s -> 9767.18s]  This is like seems really bad
[9767.34s -> 9771.92s]  He's he's got a quest. It says who's a good boy. I can't even touch him
[9772.72s -> 9777.49s]  Philly's furry friend fancies a fantastic feast. Look at this perfect little sausage
[9777.49s -> 9784.09s]  I've got to find him a yummy treat a meal fit for a puppy prince on his special day reward a hundred XP
[9784.93s -> 9786.93s]  You shoot me in the head. I
[9789.09s -> 9795.08s]  Stuck I don't speak bark amigo. I'm stuck in third person
[9795.44s -> 9799.28s]  Yeah, I'm stuck in third person too. Oh, you still are because I can't interact with anything
[9801.10s -> 9803.42s]  This is my world. You're just passing through no
[9813.34s -> 9820.55s]  Only in the camp, okay, I love this little thing little wheels
[9822.74s -> 9831.77s]  All right, I guess we're gonna um build a gorilla camp I think you have to do that
[9832.25s -> 9835.61s]  Would you rather have access to a wingsuit and
[9837.01s -> 9842.33s]  Hide out locations for fast travel. Mm-hmm, or
[9843.21s -> 9846.61s]  No, the other one sucks. What is it? You can't just say but you know, yeah
[9846.61s -> 9849.45s]  What if I want that one's a fishing hut and we've already tried that
[9851.06s -> 9857.26s]  Didn't go so well. Mm-hmm, and then visit a cantina and trade animal and fish meat for
[9858.10s -> 9866.31s]  Meals that grant temporary buffs like in that one Capcom game that everybody likes. You're the new face
[9866.51s -> 9870.79s]  Yeah, that's cool. Well, we'll do the um, the wingsuit one. Why would you pick the other one on stream?
[9870.91s -> 9873.28s]  That's like the streamer one. You have to pick that one. Oh
[9884.46s -> 9892.58s]  There are lots of big crocs search for a park west end of Cortina River has a great hunting spot a
[9892.98s -> 9897.57s]  Lot of quests now. Yeah
[9898.05s -> 9914.50s]  There's that's we don't even have the main quest or the side quest. I said mustard here. I don't have mustard on my back
[9915.80s -> 9918.17s]  water
[9919.34s -> 9924.26s]  It's a vacuum cleaner that I've turned into a put on reverse and put in your reason to connect into that into a tank
[9924.58s -> 9928.14s]  Which then it goes a little thing that goes into my mouth from the top of that and it's water
[9928.14s -> 9930.82s]  I turn the vacuum on reverse and I can drink it
[9936.42s -> 9938.59s]  I have a leader and recruits
[9939.55s -> 9944.62s]  I'm assigning. Wait a second. Are these passive missions? I think I was what did you do?
[9944.62s -> 9946.62s]  I just walked over here and put us on a cutscene
[9946.94s -> 9952.99s]  Lost tourist listen Carlos, I mean kind of was
[9956.79s -> 9964.31s]  She sent and I don't blame you have no history here again, I we just don't ever
[9966.38s -> 9969.78s]  Any way that we can get right to the fly the plane around is
[9973.90s -> 9976.38s]  What we are doing right now
[9976.38s -> 9978.38s]  In the beginning we talked about like the movie
[9978.42s -> 9982.54s]  We keep watching the far cry movie and leaving in the first act and why do we keep watching the movies?
[9982.74s -> 9987.18s]  It's got it's gotten even worse. We are not only leaving in the first act of every far cry movie
[9987.26s -> 9992.72s]  We are looking up the Wikipedia page of the movie and just reading the spoilers. We don't even care
[9992.74s -> 9998.86s]  This is how like IGN always has a walkthrough guide every single time a game launches
[9998.86s -> 10006.02s]  It's probably just like one guy who skips every single cutscene and rushes through the missions to be the first person to have like the
[10006.42s -> 10008.42s]  Google search engine optimization
[10009.10s -> 10011.10s]  like walkthrough page up
[10013.54s -> 10016.91s]  You and I are just sitting in the movie theater right now we both have our phones up
[10017.43s -> 10023.35s]  Ten minutes in the movie has gone by we're both on the Wikipedia page for that movie and we're like nudging each other
[10023.35s -> 10028.11s]  Oh, hey, man. Hey and like in like an hour or two, I guess I guess like this main character like dies
[10028.11s -> 10030.48s]  Oh, yeah, it's crazy
[10030.88s -> 10033.44s]  And we believe
[10034.00s -> 10041.97s]  Then there's the reverse the person who doesn't care about any gameplay and just watches the like cutscene YouTube compilation
[10042.85s -> 10046.76s]  Just to skip through the Lord. Oh, you can do that afterwards
[10047.40s -> 10052.16s]  You're saying it's super loud. So everyone's hearing you
[10052.98s -> 10063.67s]  Yeah, we're broadcasting it. We are broadcasting us sitting in
[10065.11s -> 10067.11s]  Okay, all right
[10067.11s -> 10073.58s]  We're broadcasting us sitting in the theater reading the Wikipedia page really loudly and we leave after an hour of the movie
[10089.74s -> 10091.86s]  The horse is too smart won't do it
[10092.46s -> 10094.46s]  You shoot
[10097.90s -> 10118.82s]  Compound over here. How did I miss that? It's impossible. I can't do this fov. It is too low
[10119.96s -> 10127.74s]  Why would you drive a gas truck here?
[10133.12s -> 10135.12s]  I guess oh shit. Oh shit. I'm done
[10137.53s -> 10139.29s]  3,000 IQ like
[10139.29s -> 10142.69s]  Suicide bomb play I guess they like island would be rid of us
[10142.81s -> 10151.32s]  Just sacrificing two people in a gas tank. That's not smoke the cigar
[10152.04s -> 10155.50s]  Anytime a character in a game smokes a cigar
[10156.38s -> 10159.18s]  Doesn't matter what game it is. You want one? No
[10163.03s -> 10167.22s]  What I was going to say is I did
[10169.58s -> 10171.58s]  It's over. I can't say it
[10171.70s -> 10173.10s]  you
[10173.10s -> 10176.08s]  Okay, you know a metal gear solid when you smoke the cigar and you hear the
[10176.96s -> 10183.82s]  I can't I'm not gonna try the bomb there
[10190.69s -> 10197.60s]  Who dropped the smoke made where's what is where's that? Yeah
[10203.69s -> 10209.22s]  Holy shit, but that was what that was a civilian
[10210.82s -> 10214.42s]  They're a combat now, I mean that was very very fine
[10232.15s -> 10236.68s]  Destroy the poison
[10236.68s -> 10245.24s]  It's a tank. There's a tank where I need help. He knows Hank. He knows. Where's our tank? Oh
[10248.77s -> 10252.68s]  That's a tank
[10258.32s -> 10265.78s]  Eat shit mother fucker. I get him. I don't think so
[10266.44s -> 10274.92s]  Now you now you're doing the same thing. I was doing. All right. Well, he's very clearly he's it right now
[10274.92s -> 10278.92s]  He's like, oh fuck. I can't do anything. You can't can you hijack these? I don't think so
[10278.92s -> 10281.04s]  I think this guy homemade with the tank. Yeah
[10282.16s -> 10284.00s]  If I stand up will he shoot me in the head?
[10284.00s -> 10289.56s]  Yep, well, they shoot me with I want to get shot with this thing though. No, don't blame
[10291.91s -> 10296.22s]  Like Burnham and do shit press V
[10306.99s -> 10308.99s]  Strategy was not to play
[10313.46s -> 10319.66s]  Fell on me he knew he's like, you know, I last I sit here long enough these two fucking dickheads
[10319.66s -> 10324.40s]  They're gonna just die. I heard on the radio what they've been doing
[10329.44s -> 10334.11s]  I'm completely safe here. How do you do wingsuit and you
[10335.76s -> 10336.88s]  shift
[10336.88s -> 10338.08s]  shift
[10338.08s -> 10357.13s]  Doesn't do anything
[10358.25s -> 10360.25s]  That's how you go
[10360.65s -> 10366.32s]  We're like doing all this really important. We're like liberating all these places. We're doing all this stuff
[10366.32s -> 10370.92s]  We're like and you just hit your head on a wall from the wingsuit. Like why would we even use these?
[10371.56s -> 10374.12s]  What a fucking stupid idea
[10375.28s -> 10377.72s]  frying pan Joe
[10378.32s -> 10382.86s]  I can't deploy a wingsuit. Are you the only one that has it?
[10383.90s -> 10388.90s]  Maybe you can't there's no like shift button. I can't do it. I think you're the only one that has it
[10389.34s -> 10392.80s]  You might be able to pick it up at the camp
[10394.84s -> 10398.16s]  Well, I try to fly into somebody
[10400.44s -> 10407.00s]  If you can fly directly into somebody and just like Superman superhero tackle them I see you engineer
[10407.60s -> 10418.16s]  Where'd the people go? There's nobody here. Oh
[10420.69s -> 10424.69s]  Yeah, you gotta you gotta slide tackle you gotta tackle lieutenant Alfonso
[10424.69s -> 10432.19s]  I gotta walk all the way up the hills just to reset the joke. This feels like a YouTube video. Oh
[10434.94s -> 10440.53s]  We've been spotted I do with that information that you need to we've been spotted
[10447.99s -> 10451.99s]  That you freaked that guy out that guy is backing away he's terrified
[10452.71s -> 10459.36s]  He can't believe what you did. I need them to be like standing still
[10460.44s -> 10462.04s]  The 10th
[10462.04s -> 10471.99s]  Okay, this guy your dog is killing the guy we have to kill. He just completed the mission for us. Where are you?
[10475.99s -> 10479.25s]  It's good because I miss it's not there's no way
[10480.89s -> 10482.89s]  Perfectly still
[10483.97s -> 10486.25s]  This is a guy there's a guy said fuck
[10487.09s -> 10495.27s]  There's a friendly civilian in there fighting for us. What? Yeah, the guy with the blue dot
[10496.11s -> 10498.27s]  Well
[10498.27s -> 10500.38s]  He's dead now
[10500.38s -> 10505.55s]  What did you just throw?
[10505.79s -> 10517.24s]  All right, I need stuff like watching the video and play the actual game here. We did
[10527.36s -> 10532.87s]  I'll be with like one of these mounted guns
[10534.23s -> 10536.23s]  He actually is trying to run you over
[10536.51s -> 10538.60s]  Rosie
[10538.60s -> 10540.60s]  I'm distracting him. I
[10540.84s -> 10542.84s]  Mean smoke right now. I can't see anything. I
[10544.81s -> 10546.29s]  Need some backup
[10546.29s -> 10566.50s]  No, he's getting closer
[10567.82s -> 10584.92s]  Hey, hey luckily. He forgot he has a forward mounted like explosive their motors somewhere over here if they fight like they have to me
[10584.92s -> 10589.90s]  I think we're supposed to hang out. Hang on. Can we just like hot-swap the backpack to Rockets?
[10591.08s -> 10593.08s]  Can you hot like just swap it out? Oh
[10593.48s -> 10601.79s]  Yeah, I have to make him dizzy fucker. What are you talking about?
[10602.43s -> 10616.10s]  Get away from me done. How'd you do that? I just changed back to rocket pack
[10617.27s -> 10621.53s]  Okay, to be careful. My jetpack wasn't doing anything
[10622.11s -> 10624.14s]  Your dog needs help
[10624.14s -> 10626.36s]  Okay
[10626.36s -> 10631.53s]  He's fine. He's good. Okay
[10635.24s -> 10649.06s]  Whatever. Oh, yeah, don't shoot the horses. Don't shoot the horses. Why do they just keep walking down this hill?
[10649.06s -> 10651.06s]  I think the alarm raised
[10651.06s -> 10658.24s]  The horses bark. Okay, this is like they've got they've got horses mobility
[10659.00s -> 10661.30s]  Long-range guns. This is like in John Wick
[10662.02s -> 10666.50s]  When all of the enemies are the bad guys for some reason enter like gun food
[10666.50s -> 10669.46s]  Right so that he can disarm them and like throw them to the ground
[10670.22s -> 10672.65s]  And you forgot about the music that place
[10673.25s -> 10675.25s]  that like
[10680.41s -> 10685.70s]  We're gonna move
[10698.86s -> 10702.38s]  We have to destroy the poison containers that's a mission we're on right now
[10705.90s -> 10709.46s]  Forget oh my god such an opportunity such an opportunity
[10713.18s -> 10718.48s]  Dropping in oh you shooting it. I've sniped him like five times. What the fuck?
[10719.42s -> 10721.42s]  Like I can't be alive
[10722.10s -> 10728.09s]  Why do they always get the fun helicopters? What's my dog on fire? Oh
[10732.06s -> 10740.10s]  War crime Andy what what are you talking about? Hey, I'm dying helping
[10740.80s -> 10744.51s]  What me too? Oh
[10744.75s -> 10763.15s]  The helicopter did it it's cuz you were shooting the guy parachuting that's it. Oh, oh shit. Oh shit
[10763.15s -> 10767.67s]  Okay, right. You know what if they didn't want to get shot, then they should have teardrop somewhere else
[10768.51s -> 10769.95s]  before crime
[10769.95s -> 10775.51s]  Well, I they're poisoning people. I have no defense. I have no defense
[10776.03s -> 10784.58s]  Well, why are we here? I don't know they put us all the way back here
[10785.34s -> 10791.78s]  Were we just at one of the two objectives? Yeah, but we died
[10792.50s -> 10799.31s]  Let's say let's take a look at the map for a second because we I feel like we're just running around like morons
[10799.67s -> 10806.55s]  Clear the air. So now the pole now we have to poison his troops. No, wait
[10806.55s -> 10810.39s]  Now he's poisoning his troops is killing us take out the crow
[10810.39s -> 10818.02s]  Yeah, crop dusters yellow tankers fumigators as what we're doing if we take out the anti-air gun, then we can fly which is
[10818.78s -> 10826.90s]  Here right next to the oh, I got an idea which one you want to do first
[10827.34s -> 10836.19s]  My idea is driving away wait coming back
[10836.59s -> 10852.97s]  This is the poison trucks. What the fuck? Holy shit. Oh my god
[10853.89s -> 10868.49s]  Okay. Well, we got it. Is this what you wanted? Yeah, are you in the car? No, I'm coming. Alright, so what was your plan?
[10868.49s -> 10875.41s]  I don't it's like put c4 on this and it's like driving in the middle of thing and then go full speed and dive out and blow it
[10875.41s -> 10876.33s]  up
[10876.33s -> 10880.04s]  Do we have c4?
[10881.91s -> 10885.31s]  Not really, but I mean if we could just shoot it fast enough afterward
[10885.95s -> 10892.11s]  Be fine. Oh, couldn't we also just shoot the car and it would explode and do the same thing. That's what I just said
[10892.11s -> 10894.11s]  Yeah, yeah, but we're not when forget about the c4
[10894.75s -> 10898.99s]  Yeah, that's what I that's what I said. Oh, you just said that we have c4 and I just said yeah
[10898.99s -> 10901.89s]  We could just dive out and if we can shoot the car fast enough, then it'll explode
[10901.89s -> 10907.13s]  Oh, I thought you said oh what if we just shoot the car and skip the c4 like it was your own idea
[10907.13s -> 10913.09s]  No, I was I was corroborating your idea because I thought you said that we could get c4 and shoot the c4
[10914.09s -> 10920.91s]  German never listens to the plan. Yeah, that's why they call me the wild car
[10921.91s -> 10923.91s]  That's you crazy stuff like this
[10924.35s -> 10927.93s]  In my friend group, I'm the wild one
[10940.98s -> 10944.63s]  Are you dead? Oh fuck
[10953.39s -> 10959.34s]  Hey, thanks. Oh, that's a spill-in
[10959.98s -> 10968.26s]  Hey

[10972.86s -> 10981.62s]  We have to take out the crop duster thingies up there
[10991.62s -> 10994.88s]  How are we supposed to actually get rid of that?
[10995.28s -> 11015.31s]  We need our own helicopter. This guy just has such an advantage. I give rockets or something
[11015.31s -> 11017.31s]  I don't have any rockets or anything. No
[11017.59s -> 11028.10s]  We just have to shoot the pilot. I mean you make that sound like that's a simple thing to do. I have this thing
[11028.74s -> 11050.06s]  Damnit going up top. I just popped an entire bottle of pills. Oh
[11055.26s -> 11061.92s]  What happened the crash into me did the plane crash into me
[11064.92s -> 11069.24s]  Did you get a good view of that? Oh, I hope so cuz I want to see that later
[11071.35s -> 11072.99s]  What the fuck?
[11072.99s -> 11077.75s]  I'm coming. Oh my god
[11078.39s -> 11088.34s]  But yeah, it would straight it. Okay. Hang on. Hang on. Stay up here

[11119.33s -> 11122.57s]  Opportunity we're gonna sit here all day until you do this. I don't care how long it takes
[11124.17s -> 11130.85s]  I don't care how long it takes you this wingsuit. You get back up here this instant and and we do this
[11130.85s -> 11137.87s]  I

[11142.43s -> 11148.13s]  Like my body's right next to her. How did that not hit? I guess it didn't hit
[11151.61s -> 11156.22s]  she's
[11156.22s -> 11160.12s]  Deceptively like you gotta like drop. All right. This is this is the one
[11161.06s -> 11163.06s]  Training will be complete. Oh

[11185.54s -> 11190.78s]  And she's still alive still alive. Yeah, she killed me. She killed you
[11192.26s -> 11194.26s]  That's so stupid. Oh

[11226.21s -> 11239.32s]  What are you doing? Somebody said everything is funnier when it's far away. You know what? That's actually true
[11239.32s -> 11256.33s]  I think you're missing you just I'm just a core challenge. You just did an achievement
[11257.05s -> 11259.05s]  Okay, that was just

[11281.38s -> 11283.38s]  Man, that was actually pretty fun
[11283.46s -> 11286.26s]  Okay, now say it enough times. It'll be true
[11288.35s -> 11296.82s]  Wait, here's the people feel POV of the plane. I need to see this. Come on. We have to watch this

[11312.31s -> 11316.88s]  Okay, let's take a look this is your POV
[11317.56s -> 11318.94s]  Yes
[11318.94s -> 11331.41s]  All right. That was awesome. I'll see without you shooting it. It looked like he was gonna just drive into it
[11331.95s -> 11338.00s]  It was going to be pretty close. Yeah, it may have actually rammed into you possibly you just made sure it was gonna happen
[11338.18s -> 11343.53s]  Yeah, that was actually awesome. All right back to it. What were we doing?
[11344.55s -> 11351.21s]  New gun. Did you get that gun? Yeah, do you have to loot everything that I lose? I think you know, I got the gun
[11351.61s -> 11368.46s]  There's no that there's still point is it poison inside so there's still shit to do. Yeah the hell
[11369.10s -> 11372.02s]  Just I was just giving you a moment to regroup. Okay
[11372.94s -> 11374.94s]  Let's go

[11381.18s -> 11394.91s]  Will this looks like poison container over here. This looks pretty poisonous doesn't it? Yeah, you can't just walking in the poison
[11395.51s -> 11403.11s]  What's the origin of it? It's a guy in the watchtower. He's climbing down to come to us
[11409.60s -> 11415.48s]  It was the last thing he's ever saw he ever saw I fucked it up a bad one-liner
[11416.06s -> 11424.92s]  Okay, so it's just everywhere over here
[11425.78s -> 11428.28s]  That's so goddamn loud

[13039.92s -> 13054.12s]  That uh go differently in your head. Yeah, are you drowning?
[13055.76s -> 13058.32s]  But your head just went up all above the water. That's not fair
[13059.36s -> 13061.36s]  Hold on you get air
[13066.86s -> 13069.04s]  I'm gonna live that's not fair
[13069.68s -> 13071.52s]  That's unfair
[13071.52s -> 13083.29s]  the best laid jokes
[13083.29s -> 13085.61s]  Why am I i'm sinking further than I think I should be
[13086.64s -> 13089.44s]  This is this deep
[13089.44s -> 13093.04s]  Uh, how deep is this? This is deep fucking water. What's going on?
[13094.28s -> 13099.32s]  Let that be a lesson kids. Okay, don't try and cross real rivers just because it looks shallow
[13099.64s -> 13102.52s]  This river is like 700 feet deep
[13103.08s -> 13107.08s]  Probably died on the oregon trail and in the crusades
[13111.10s -> 13116.20s]  Where are you? I am 5 000 feet underneath this water. Okay that
[13117.40s -> 13119.40s]  Actually, you're right. Let that be a lesson
[13120.25s -> 13129.39s]  You are uh, you just gotta watch dogs. I think that's what happened. Oh deep is this actually
[13129.95s -> 13131.63s]  Okay, so you were under the map
[13131.63s -> 13135.23s]  Yeah, okay. This is literally like five six feet deep. Not even like four feet deep
[13136.03s -> 13138.75s]  That was really weird unless there's this one like giant sinkhole thing
[13141.40s -> 13144.12s]  I think I think what happened was I was still on the back of the buggy
[13144.76s -> 13149.00s]  And you spawned on me, but since I was like facing up behind me was like under
[13150.20s -> 13151.56s]  the soil
[13151.56s -> 13153.00s]  Oh, I see
[13153.00s -> 13163.20s]  Oh, this is nice
[13163.20s -> 13166.00s]  Don't you dare i'll be very mad at you if you shoot that thing

[13528.68s -> 13531.64s]  It was 56 car accidents in 15 seconds
[13532.28s -> 13536.28s]  Who's at fault? Did you have the right away? I have no idea. You're all just going to jail
[13536.28s -> 13538.92s]  I guess I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do with this
[13552.41s -> 13554.59s]  No

[13561.34s -> 13570.59s]  He doesn't know oh that hit us. That was a direct hit
[13575.16s -> 13577.32s]  I don't think that was him. Was it him?
[13578.40s -> 13580.40s]  Why is he still driving down the road?
[13580.56s -> 13591.56s]  I gotta get this on camera

[13639.69s -> 13641.84s]  Okay
[13641.84s -> 13644.72s]  Oh, i'm just thinking of like this judge looking at this video
[13647.23s -> 13650.99s]  Oh, by the way, I i'm not even sure those cats are legal to own
[13651.87s -> 13653.47s]  Whose cat is that?

[13702.70s -> 13704.70s]  I think we can do whatever we want
[13705.48s -> 13707.56s]  We could just look at the map to go somewhere
[13708.44s -> 13710.59s]  um
[13710.59s -> 13712.59s]  We could just keep fighting in the middle of this

[13737.20s -> 13740.24s]  It's raining though. No, nothing turns them when the windshield wipers are on
[13741.04s -> 13745.87s]  You hit the rain button apparently so
[13753.07s -> 13755.07s]  We could do the good boy mission
[13755.15s -> 13757.15s]  Let's think. Oh, okay
[13757.23s -> 13759.53s]  Let's just get back there and see what we can even do
[13763.68s -> 13765.68s]  Uh, let's do

[13795.16s -> 13797.16s]  Does paper boy usually drive a truck?
[13798.16s -> 13799.45s]  I don't know
[13799.45s -> 13805.44s]  Yeah
[13805.44s -> 13807.44s]  Nobody knows what paper boy is
[13807.77s -> 13810.73s]  Yes, they do. Come on. That's like that's what's saying. You don't know what pac-man is
[13812.78s -> 13816.54s]  I mean paper boy isn't a isn't a smash bros character. So should have been
[13828.30s -> 13831.76s]  Still going this way
[13831.76s -> 13836.64s]  I still think I don't think i'm holy fuck. I must flip that person. Uh, yeah, it's actually behind us now
[13839.76s -> 13841.76s]  Actually, you could just take this road again. Okay
[13842.78s -> 13844.30s]  to the left

[13878.25s -> 13883.53s]  Did she just scream really loud? I i'm wondering if the cat
[13884.51s -> 13885.39s]  No
[13885.39s -> 13894.27s]  Oh, no, she's like, yeah, she's like saying yes, dude, just fast travel. I got the bird
[13894.91s -> 13897.71s]  We can uh, we can press f in the mini map or on the big map
[13903.95s -> 13908.36s]  Where'd the bird go?
[13908.36s -> 13914.73s]  Hey, uh hit up the map fast travel to the big blue. There we go. Much faster
[13925.85s -> 13929.21s]  Oh, do you have a solid state drive? Yeah, I do
[13930.51s -> 13932.49s]  Am I still loading?
[13932.49s -> 13933.68s]  Yeah
[13933.68s -> 13936.81s]  39 to you omegalo
[13936.81s -> 13938.84s]  uh
[13938.84s -> 13941.15s]  That doesn't compute data
[13941.63s -> 13948.17s]  But you know keep flexing. Yeah
[13949.12s -> 13952.24s]  What a sellout, but I bought no it's called I got scammed
[13954.00s -> 13956.32s]  I'm one of the people that built their computer like
[13957.40s -> 13964.84s]  Seven months ago eight months ago and graphics cards. You couldn't get them. It was so hard to get I have some bad news for you
[13965.00s -> 13967.63s]  but you still can't
[13969.47s -> 13975.23s]  Oh really? Oh shit, but I I ended up like I needed a graphics card
[13975.55s -> 13980.06s]  I've waited and waited and waited and waited and we tried over and over again to get something that wasn't a 30 90
[13980.06s -> 13982.06s]  And it was like all right. Well, I need to get a graphics card
[13982.54s -> 13993.24s]  I don't even care you paid 50 000 for 30 90. No, I did not this is taking a very long time
[13993.32s -> 13998.57s]  I will say though. Yeah, I think it's uh, i'm gonna say game probably crashed in the loading screen
[13999.64s -> 14006.70s]  30 90 but no 1080p stream metallics. I would let you take this one. Would you like to explain that? Um, sure
[14007.48s -> 14014.44s]  See you have to get approved by twitch to have more than six megabit per second up for 1080p to look good
[14015.53s -> 14019.61s]  Why does 1080p not look good at 6 000 up? Could you explain that for the audience, please?
[14020.09s -> 14022.09s]  because bitrate
[14022.09s -> 14024.09s]  sucks and uh
[14024.17s -> 14028.49s]  cox cox the internet but also
[14033.69s -> 14035.69s]  I got error coded. Oh, no
[14037.23s -> 14043.32s]  All right. Well, we have to wait. Hopefully this is script the whole game. Is that gonna mess the game up?
[14043.56s -> 14051.02s]  Oh shit, you host it though, right? So we should do your game
[14052.48s -> 14055.52s]  I am trying to load back in I will never fast travel ever again
[14055.68s -> 14061.36s]  That was the problem, you know, you know how every single video game always says never close your game during like a loading screen
[14063.80s -> 14068.57s]  And our game just crashed during a loading screen. That's a lot of bullshit
[14070.04s -> 14074.44s]  And i'm I press continue to like continue my game and i'm in another loading screen
[14075.20s -> 14086.00s]  I'm just gonna force quit the game. I'm in the process of force quitting. Oh, i'm right. Wait, you got in i'm not
[14087.08s -> 14094.78s]  Yeah, because you have to join me, but i'm still stuck in the loading screen. Oh, yeah, you've got to force quit then
[14094.94s -> 14099.20s]  I'm still hearing the game's audio and the game is force quit
[14101.79s -> 14111.13s]  I'm very upset right now. Why is this the game three people?
[14111.45s -> 14120.73s]  Yeah, there is no ubisoft game open right now and i'm still I still hear the music of the loading menu
[14122.12s -> 14126.92s]  Why does it is it just me or does it sound like i'm like witcher music you still have them?
[14127.16s -> 14137.96s]  This is weird. I've closed everything it says farcar6 is running right now. What? Okay. I need to like give me a sec
[14140.91s -> 14142.91s]  Force quit the application, but it's already closed
[14150.33s -> 14154.19s]  2021 triple a release. Oh megalo. You know what I mean?
[14156.44s -> 14168.76s]  Come back in triple a doesn't exist anymore. What's your favorite game of all time?

[14211.12s -> 14212.64s]  I gauge how much
[14212.64s -> 14216.36s]  I like a game based on how much time I put into a game. So
[14217.00s -> 14218.92s]  I've put the most time
[14218.92s -> 14221.56s]  Into like team fortress into like world of warcraft
[14221.88s -> 14225.80s]  Although I would say world of warcraft should be on that list up until like wrath of the lich king
[14226.36s -> 14230.68s]  That's it. Wow doesn't exist in my brain really
[14231.16s -> 14238.03s]  Until after wrath of the lich king. All right. I'm ready for an invite if you can

[14342.86s -> 14347.98s]  Don't be mean. It's all right. It's not really mean. It's like it's like appeals to the chat at the expense of you
[14348.06s -> 14352.17s]  Oh, yeah, sure. Go on. Let's hear it. Oh worst stream of 2021
[14352.57s -> 14359.50s]  Uh number 10 out of 10. Is that what you're saying? He said there's been 10 bad streams this year
[14360.00s -> 14362.48s]  No, there's been 10 streams this year. Oh
[14366.67s -> 14368.84s]  That's not true
[14368.84s -> 14388.86s]  That's not true. All right, let's do that. We're doing crocodile meat. These can't be trusted. Okay me
[14389.18s -> 14395.82s]  Yeah, you just fired at that guy. Why did you just just what did you shoot turkey? What is that?
[14396.14s -> 14410.43s]  He was a pelican by the way, he'll be soft. What is going on here? Really? What's wrong with you? My
[14410.99s -> 14418.09s]  Controls got reset. Okay. Well now I have to do this. I have to like disable this again
[14418.91s -> 14430.99s]  You feel like sending me messages. Hold on. Let me turn off notifications
[14433.74s -> 14443.15s]  Oh this fuck. Oh who fucking has that? It was me. Did you leak me? Did you leak me?
[14443.31s -> 14449.31s]  You got listen, oh you leaked me I got some bad news 120 gigabytes of my computer have leaked
[14449.71s -> 14451.77s]  onto the bit torrent
[14451.77s -> 14454.89s]  No, you don't no. No, I don't know. No, no more leaks
[14460.30s -> 14471.92s]  All right. I'm ready, but no when I try to invite you from the in-game menu it popped up
[14472.64s -> 14474.67s]  Oh, I don't care
[14474.67s -> 14488.62s]  Uh, I don't care. It's it's my epic games launcher account. I'm not i'm not concerned about it. Fuck you, bro
[14492.33s -> 14494.89s]  Listen, I think we can all just blame ubisoft
[14496.81s -> 14502.96s]  Can see their shitty overlay inside games well you can you can actually blame ubisoft for
[14504.40s -> 14507.85s]  Having ubisoft connect in the first place
[14507.85s -> 14508.09s]  All right
[14508.09s -> 14511.13s]  So we don't fast travel but we have to go all the way down here
[14513.23s -> 14526.14s]  I haven't mocked so like getting in the car and like turning the radio off
[14526.70s -> 14528.06s]  feels like
[14528.06s -> 14533.42s]  Getting an uber on quiet mode like they're like jamming out in the car. But then since you asked for like silence
[14534.22s -> 14536.22s]  They pick you up and they turn it off
[14549.92s -> 14551.92s]  That's an option yeah
[14553.95s -> 14555.15s]  although
[14555.15s -> 14559.23s]  Sometimes you will pick that option and they probably just don't even like
[14561.39s -> 14575.05s]  Okay. Um, just trying to did you get out? No, I mean i'm here. I'm just watching. Who's the blip on the map?
[14578.54s -> 14579.74s]  um
[14579.74s -> 14581.74s]  I mean you ran over a guy
[14585.00s -> 14587.00s]  Yeah, i've picked quiet ride before
[14587.48s -> 14590.11s]  He's like, all right, let's have a quiet ride
[14591.16s -> 14596.76s]  And you get picked up and the person just like hey arty. How are you? How you doing stranger? It's just like oh shit
[14597.80s -> 14608.49s]  So what are you up to in town?
[14608.49s -> 14612.68s]  I'm just like, oh wait, I guess you didn't look at the thing that I clicked
[14613.32s -> 14619.92s]  And I wonder if sometimes do you
[14620.88s -> 14624.88s]  It's alex do you think do you think that people look at that after they get picked up like if you get picked up
[14624.88s -> 14626.88s]  And you know that you were talking
[14627.36s -> 14630.80s]  Do you think you get really pissed off at yourself after seeing that afterwards?
[14631.44s -> 14633.04s]  Are you like, oh
[14633.04s -> 14637.60s]  Oh my god, that person wanted me to shut the fuck up and I talked for for 30 straight minutes
[14639.29s -> 14642.81s]  See, that's what I that's what I did when I got in here, but I just didn't want to say anything
[14646.56s -> 14651.36s]  I feel like that's a really really scary moment where you're just like, all right. See you later. Have a wonderful trip
[14651.44s -> 14656.08s]  It's been a great time having you in the car. You look over and you see like in the settings they picked quiet ride
[14658.41s -> 14662.89s]  That's what I that's what I said, I picked quiet ride, but anyway, thank thank you. Thank you. It's been fun
[14663.29s -> 14665.29s]  Um, i'll be sure to leave a five-star review
[14666.59s -> 14669.23s]  And i'm changing my tip right now. No
[14672.17s -> 14674.01s]  That's what you were doing
[14674.01s -> 14690.08s]  All right. So we have we have this quest, but what does he want us to go? Is that the meat one?
[14691.55s -> 14693.55s]  uh, this is a
[14694.44s -> 14696.76s]  main quest the meat one is
[14698.49s -> 14700.01s]  We have to find
[14700.01s -> 14703.29s]  Crocodiles also are we gonna are we gonna do the meme?
[14703.85s -> 14709.55s]  What's the meme?
[14709.55s -> 14711.55s]  This is the meme. What do you do?
[14715.13s -> 14718.01s]  Well, if uh, if the menu didn't come up this would have done it
[14718.09s -> 14723.88s]  So it was going to happen regardless because you're also on this screen. I don't understand
[14724.44s -> 14727.96s]  Uh, you have to you have to press you have to talk to this guy and press ready
[14733.10s -> 14740.70s]  Do we play can you like speak to this dude? I can't talk to this guy. Um, how come i'm ready and you're not
[14742.32s -> 14744.32s]  Oh, what the fuck this guy
[14744.56s -> 14749.47s]  You're gonna jump in the ring yourself go check out that box next to the arena
[14749.47s -> 14752.59s]  It's not even my name. That's somebody else's never did anything for you. That's a fake name
[14752.67s -> 14760.20s]  Somebody would have you need to find and pick at least one rooster. Oh, we don't have a we don't have one
[14760.44s -> 14776.76s]  Uh, there's one in a box like around I picked one up. I don't get it roosters. It's a rooster
[14780.72s -> 14782.72s]  Uh, there was one inside of like a crate
[14782.88s -> 14791.32s]  Do I have a two I think because you picked it up you uh, maybe maybe since I picked it up both of us got it
[14791.95s -> 14793.95s]  I guess some new faces
[14794.03s -> 14800.12s]  Muy bien, just as i'm ready. This sport is not for the faint of heart. What is this? Well, who am I inviting?
[14802.03s -> 14804.03s]  Are we in a game?
[14804.11s -> 14812.28s]  Yeah, I don't how do you start this? How do you start this here? Let me okay. There we go. Choose your fight. Wait, oh
[14814.89s -> 14827.42s]  What the fuck is this bet? Why is there a character select screen for this?
[14830.36s -> 14840.51s]  You know italics has the secret dlc box. I actually aren't any dlc cups. What the fuck
[14841.39s -> 14843.39s]  Wait, we're actually gonna do this
[14850.19s -> 14852.19s]  It's like street fighter
[14854.83s -> 14856.91s]  Uh, how do you I don't know how to do this
[14858.35s -> 14859.55s]  What?
[14859.55s -> 14861.55s]  How do you fight? I don't know
[14863.29s -> 14866.43s]  What's the let's see attack buttons?
[14866.51s -> 14867.55s]  e
[14867.55s -> 14876.25s]  I'm pressing like every button
[14876.25s -> 14878.73s]  I can't there's no like attack. Yeah, there is no
[14879.13s -> 14885.29s]  This is like every new fighting game. Wait, wait back up back up. I'm just gonna practice some combos over here in the quarter
[14886.80s -> 14888.83s]  mouse one
[14888.83s -> 14890.83s]  Yeah, yeah, don't fight me yet
[14892.54s -> 14894.46s]  jkl
[14894.46s -> 14896.89s]  Shit
[14896.89s -> 14906.99s]  Oh
[14906.99s -> 14908.99s]  This is kind of fucked up don't you think?
[14911.34s -> 14913.42s]  like before before after we um
[14914.14s -> 14917.53s]  murdered all the civilians
[14917.61s -> 14918.97s]  Yeah
[14918.97s -> 14926.59s]  You have to build meter
[14928.76s -> 14931.40s]  This is it. There was okay. First of all, there's like
[14932.10s -> 14934.10s]  25 characters in this
[14935.95s -> 14937.79s]  Okay, how do you block?
[14937.79s -> 14943.68s]  I don't think there is a block
[14943.68s -> 14946.64s]  There is meter. Yeah, there's meter left control
[14947.52s -> 14955.23s]  Did you do super what the fuck how do you just it was left control
[14961.61s -> 14967.80s]  Come on
[14967.80s -> 14970.12s]  They spent like way too much time on this
[14972.03s -> 14980.70s]  This is i'm like i'm like getting sweaty right now
[14984.70s -> 14986.70s]  And then flap right over your head
[14996.48s -> 15001.68s]  What dude we're like holding it like oh good a good job like petting the the the chicken
[15003.21s -> 15004.73s]  What?
[15004.73s -> 15008.92s]  the fuck
[15008.92s -> 15010.92s]  Oh, dude
[15011.64s -> 15016.12s]  What
[15016.20s -> 15021.48s]  All right. Well that that you can unlock uh, 25 different chickens that you can um, you can fight with them
[15022.12s -> 15026.25s]  You can yeah
[15026.25s -> 15028.57s]  now let's go back to playing the other game that I think is
[15029.43s -> 15033.93s]  Significantly more tasteful where my attack dog can rip the throat out of the people that I have trained it to
[15034.73s -> 15040.01s]  And then go back to running over civilians with tractors and shooting people mindlessly in the head
[15040.09s -> 15042.09s]  I think that's a little bit more tasteful guys
[15044.64s -> 15046.32s]  All right, let's go
[15046.32s -> 15056.67s]  Do we have to go to the road?
[15056.67s -> 15058.35s]  good point
[15058.35s -> 15065.26s]  So where's this? Where's this? Do you have it something map? I don't have this on my map
[15065.90s -> 15068.27s]  That I saw them down at the road
[15070.99s -> 15072.19s]  in
[15072.19s -> 15075.63s]  Here we go. Uh, well we have options. Oh, okay, we can do this
[15077.68s -> 15079.36s]  we can do
[15079.36s -> 15081.98s]  Whatever this purple quest is
[15091.15s -> 15094.67s]  Why don't you give us a give us something cool to do while I spawn a plane?
[15095.31s -> 15103.36s]  The biggest map is actually pretty large
[15106.60s -> 15111.42s]  Uh, we'd like just got to the main island. Yeah, but if it's anything like any of the other ubisoft games
[15112.28s -> 15116.68s]  Um, it's probably just a copy and paste of this five times
[15121.08s -> 15123.80s]  Assassin's creed valhalla was actually too big
[15125.58s -> 15127.74s]  It was unplayed. It was like no there's no way to finish
[15130.03s -> 15131.23s]  Yeah
[15131.23s -> 15134.11s]  As we go into the next generation of video games
[15136.27s -> 15141.47s]  I don't a settling point for a game is not how big a map is right? I feel like that people are still on that
[15142.70s -> 15148.06s]  Yeah, there's no reason to make a game like a like a adventure action game like 300 hours
[15148.06s -> 15153.90s]  Well, all you do is pop in and out of cover to shoot your enemies and listen to cutscenes. Sorry red dead
[15155.42s -> 15157.42s]  Just wait, you just talked shit about red dead
[15158.22s -> 15160.46s]  Yeah, it was a baiting switch. You thought I was talking about ubisoft game
[15160.54s -> 15162.54s]  Really? I was talking about red dead too you
[15163.42s -> 15166.22s]  Oh, I I just fucking threw up for a second. You just what'd you say?
[15166.22s -> 15169.66s]  But what'd you say about red dead being you don't like it? What'd you say that again?
[15171.02s -> 15174.06s]  I just said it was like too long. How could you possibly finish it?
[15174.94s -> 15186.91s]  Is I love that game it's alexis based no, I am i'm based i'm the base one stop saying that
[15193.88s -> 15195.88s]  No, you're cringe
[15197.50s -> 15207.47s]  It's true. Okay odds of you turning abruptly and ramming this directly into the mountain zero
[15212.24s -> 15216.20s]  I have to move
[15222.64s -> 15229.93s]  I freaked out
[15230.73s -> 15233.77s]  I could just feel it coming on. Yeah, I didn't do that on purpose
[15233.85s -> 15238.81s]  I think that was self-fulfilling prophecy level of destiny where like I created the scenario
[15241.45s -> 15246.28s]  I think so
[15246.28s -> 15248.36s]  Well, the thing just starts beeping in my ear and it's like
[15249.88s -> 15253.64s]  It's the person says a missile is gonna hit us. I'm gonna try to freak out
[15254.60s -> 15256.60s]  Okay, we can hang on. Let me pick a different mission
[15259.39s -> 15262.78s]  We can um
[15262.78s -> 15264.94s]  steal some spurs
[15264.94s -> 15266.38s]  we can
[15266.38s -> 15269.02s]  Steal a military truck. We need to do the
[15269.58s -> 15273.84s]  Don't meet a guy
[15273.84s -> 15278.50s]  Both of our chats are not going to be happy if we don't do the dachshund quest. We both have dachshunds
[15280.01s -> 15282.20s]  carrizo charrizo
[15282.20s -> 15286.20s]  charrizo the dachshund
[15286.20s -> 15290.04s]  All right helicopter you drive at this. I'm not I don't want you know, what's gonna happen if I do
[15290.84s -> 15292.84s]  Says there are lots of crocs
[15293.00s -> 15298.25s]  Try searching serpentino park. Where's serpentino park?
[15299.45s -> 15308.32s]  Uh serpentino park, okay, I see a spot is it in the same area we are in that's pretty close
[15308.88s -> 15313.66s]  It's like almost walking distance. Do you do you not have a wingsuit still?
[15314.14s -> 15322.44s]  No, unless it's like in my inventory and I have to equip it or something. Did you have to equip it?
[15323.39s -> 15334.48s]  Uh, no, I just built a like camp building come talk to this foreman and see maybe I'll just give it to me
[15335.45s -> 15341.31s]  Uh, maybe
[15341.31s -> 15350.81s]  The crocodiles are down there. Did you mark them? Yeah, only player one gets the wingsuit. Oh
[15351.61s -> 15356.40s]  Really really you have to play single player in order to unlock it because you're you're the co-op partner
[15358.68s -> 15363.00s]  Oh, so your character doesn't like so wait. Do I not exist? Is this one of those games?
[15364.17s -> 15368.01s]  Yeah, I think it's I think it's one of those uh, anything that happens only happens in my game
[15369.64s -> 15373.00s]  You know, it's really really really annoying about all that if that's true
[15374.16s -> 15381.42s]  They push the fact that this whole campaign can be played in co-op if you're gonna make that a huge part
[15381.90s -> 15387.34s]  Of your selling point for the game and again the whole campaign is playable in co-op grab a friend
[15388.75s -> 15390.75s]  But don't let him leave drop out
[15390.75s -> 15399.74s]  Don't let your fucking friend leave at least give me like the major like plot points or something
[15399.74s -> 15408.48s]  So I don't have to do the whole thing
[15408.48s -> 15410.48s]  Because like I could definitely do this
[15411.47s -> 15429.05s]  You get to have the fun. Bye. I think I got you at once didn't I you hit me once
[15430.17s -> 15446.84s]  Well, she could be as cool as me with all my premium guns my suit skin
[15446.92s -> 15450.68s]  Hold on while i'm waiting for you to come i'm gonna equip one of my new premium skins
[15453.96s -> 15460.25s]  All right. Let's see how much I care about this. Is it on?
[15464.43s -> 15467.23s]  Well, I just saw the curtain pull back from the game that just spawned in
[15470.43s -> 15473.53s]  I have cowboy boots
[15473.53s -> 15474.89s]  And a hat
[15474.89s -> 15477.42s]  It's not gonna shoot us, right?
[15477.42s -> 15479.85s]  Put your gun away put your gun away
[15479.85s -> 15483.69s]  Yeah, nice
[15483.69s -> 15486.25s]  They can't they can't see through your disguise you
[15487.50s -> 15489.71s]  budget-tier
[15489.71s -> 15492.59s]  Pyro cosplay, I guess they're unhappy
[15493.55s -> 15496.11s]  I think they've noticed that we
[15497.28s -> 15499.28s]  Look extremely suspicious
[15499.52s -> 15507.50s]  Oh my arm, how are you supposed to deal with tanks?
[15508.14s -> 15512.46s]  I think you're just supposed to avoid them
[15512.46s -> 15516.35s]  All right, get in the car
[15516.35s -> 15524.99s]  I have no heels
[15524.99s -> 15531.39s]  Who is that standing in the what who is somebody standing in the middle of the road? Who is this person?
[15533.56s -> 15539.68s]  Oh
[15539.68s -> 15542.97s]  I'm down
[15542.97s -> 15547.77s]  That escalates very quickly. You just had you got we can't avoid the tanks. We stood there for too long
[15548.09s -> 15558.25s]  Has jerma ever played a video game back in like the late 80s? I played mario 1 and 2 and stuff
[15559.84s -> 15562.16s]  I haven't played since anything since probably like mario 3
[15562.80s -> 15574.41s]  Uh, we played pong recently. All right, we're gonna stay on the road. We're not gonna stop for anything
[15574.41s -> 15577.93s]  We're not gonna shoot anybody. I'm just gonna drive on the road. We're gonna go where we're supposed to go
[15580.76s -> 15584.59s]  Are you in loading screen? Yes, I am. We're currently stuck in here again
[15585.80s -> 15602.57s]  Uh-oh, when are you gonna stream cubert? What are they gonna give bomb moms their own game?
[15608.59s -> 15612.92s]  Like how come toad gets one?
[15612.92s -> 15617.79s]  How come games made by like one person?
[15621.45s -> 15624.89s]  Like don't have you like get disconnected their loading screen
[15628.96s -> 15632.96s]  They spent a lot of money on this loading screen. This was a high tier commission
[15637.79s -> 15641.95s]  Like there are games right now that were made by like three people and they run like flawlessly
[15648.57s -> 15652.11s]  Uh, I just got booted
[15654.67s -> 15657.55s]  out of the game
[15657.55s -> 15659.55s]  He hates the game. No
[15660.20s -> 15664.20s]  I actually think it's fun. These games are all fun. They're all six out of tens, but they're fun to play
[15664.68s -> 15671.02s]  Maybe more fun if uh, we didn't have to reload in because the game crashes on a loading screen. Yeah
[15671.66s -> 15681.34s]  Yeah, i'm just gonna uh hard restart how long we've been streaming for I feel like it's been a while i'm flies when you're having fun
[15684.20s -> 15686.83s]  All right, i'm gonna force quit the game again
[15688.28s -> 15693.00s]  Hey, he hates the game. I don't hate the game. How long we've been streaming for i'm just
[15696.54s -> 15714.92s]  No, it's different. It's not what you think. Okay force quit again. It's still it's not even all my
[15716.89s -> 15723.95s]  Six out of ten. Is that the number of times that the game loads back in after you die?
[15724.51s -> 15735.40s]  I I okay. Thank god. I thought I was gonna have to restart my computer. All right strike three strike three and you're up
[15735.56s -> 15745.24s]  Ubisoft i'm telling you right now strike three and you're up coming back. Just don't die forehead
[15745.40s -> 15749.56s]  Which is yeah, we we just have to like not die and just run to where we need to go
[15749.88s -> 15761.58s]  And hey we did me and it's alex talked about playing this and we even said what did we say?
[15762.44s -> 15765.00s]  Let's wait like a week or so
[15765.08s -> 15769.00s]  So like the maybe they'll iron out the connection problem stuff, right?
[15769.72s -> 15772.68s]  You think there will be a patch in the first week? No, I don't know
[15776.91s -> 15779.71s]  It's been it was running fine for like four hours. That's what I don't understand
[15782.64s -> 15786.00s]  Maybe I should have done a full hard reset of my game too. It's only been three days
[15786.89s -> 15788.89s]  Has it really how that's been like five
[15789.29s -> 15798.36s]  Uh, can you just join off me or do I need to invite you? Uh, let me say I can join you
[15798.60s -> 15806.81s]  This is another one of those games that has like 12 splash screens before you get to the game
[15811.26s -> 15813.58s]  All right, can I join off of you? Let's find out
[15818.51s -> 15821.20s]  When the game is working
[15821.20s -> 15824.48s]  There's actually probably fewer bugs than far cry 5 had
[15826.84s -> 15833.56s]  Uh, i'm apparently i'm offline somehow. Let me see if I can just join you
[15837.77s -> 15846.25s]  but also I was basically playing with um with training weights because i've been playing the battlefield beta and uh come like
[15847.05s -> 15851.77s]  I have a total misconception of what constitutes like a buggy game after playing that because
[15853.02s -> 15857.18s]  All right, um, I I can go my friends list and I have I have three icons
[15857.26s -> 15860.78s]  One of them is a controller one of them is a chat bubble and one of them is the three dots
[15860.86s -> 15863.50s]  I don't know what any of them do i'm gonna try to press them
[15864.57s -> 15873.20s]  I think I can invite you but I can't join you. I think you're gonna have to invite me again
[15873.36s -> 15884.46s]  Resident sleeper. Yeah, I would be too. I I am right now actually that I am resident sleeper right now
[15887.12s -> 15900.24s]  Launcher on your desktop. It says you're offline for me. I don't know why you get that
[15900.40s -> 15903.85s]  I got that but I don't know why it says you're offline. All right, here we go
[15904.49s -> 15909.87s]  As i'm online i'm mine rack your knuckles. Let's go
[15911.50s -> 15913.48s]  Okay
[15913.48s -> 15921.79s]  Okay, cool. We're back. I'm in a plane. Are you in the plane?
[15922.03s -> 15926.03s]  I guess i'm just I don't think this is a good idea because how we gotta we gotta come we gotta like just
[15926.81s -> 15931.69s]  Abandon the plane before we both crash. No, no, no, he's gonna reset the game get in the plane
[15931.85s -> 15935.21s]  I'm gonna fly we're gonna jump out of our parachutes and get out
[15939.26s -> 15941.26s]  Good idea. I like that idea. Okay
[15942.14s -> 15953.45s]  The plane bit no, this is not gonna wait i'm not even driving you are just get us close enough
[15953.85s -> 15956.97s]  Once we're in the red area with the red zone. We're gonna jump out and just float
[15964.49s -> 15965.53s]  nice
[15965.53s -> 15971.60s]  Very nice. Very nice. How do you turn like the view angle?
[15972.40s -> 15977.10s]  I don't think so
[15977.10s -> 15979.10s]  How low do you think I could fly without?
[15979.26s -> 15984.33s]  Okay, and it's time for us to get out. I'm up
[15984.97s -> 15990.14s]  Did you get out?
[15990.14s -> 15997.20s]  No, let me know i'm still in the plane where you're going too far from your partner
[16000.64s -> 16005.52s]  Wait, why did you put me back in the plane? I don't want to be in the plane. I want to get out of the plane
[16005.92s -> 16007.92s]  Don't get out of the plane. No
[16012.88s -> 16014.96s]  Okay
[16014.96s -> 16017.52s]  No, don't pull me back in the plane. It's gonna pull me back in the plane
[16018.80s -> 16022.97s]  You're too far
[16022.97s -> 16029.37s]  I want one of us to survive so we don't have to have the how are you? Wait, you're alive. You're fine. Yeah, everything's chill
[16030.41s -> 16033.69s]  I'm not sure why you're in such a panic because we were in the red zone
[16034.72s -> 16036.72s]  Yeah, but there's an actual pilot
[16036.72s -> 16038.96s]  Right this time who doesn't just crash
[16039.68s -> 16044.80s]  Into the mountain at the first beep in his ear. I'm here some composure. This is what we have and uh, get respect safety
[16045.04s -> 16047.50s]  We have to go here
[16047.50s -> 16049.50s]  You got us to our destination. You did a good job
[16059.47s -> 16060.75s]  You all right
[16060.75s -> 16062.73s]  Yeah, i'm here
[16062.73s -> 16064.49s]  In fact, i'm here first
[16064.49s -> 16068.65s]  Oh, yeah
[16068.65s -> 16073.21s]  You're welcome. See imagine if we both bailed out the first time we'd be in the jungle lost
[16074.25s -> 16076.25s]  And uh, we'd have to walk like 500 meters
[16077.13s -> 16079.13s]  So I just saved the stream like, uh
[16079.21s -> 16083.85s]  12 minutes of of aimlessly wandering while we're trying to scramble for something entertaining to say
[16084.01s -> 16087.53s]  That's true to try to get a laugh in order to distract the resident sleepers in chat. That's true
[16088.17s -> 16090.49s]  Yeah, that's right. You got it. You know what you're talking about
[16091.60s -> 16098.88s]  All right. Here we go
[16098.88s -> 16100.88s]  to steal favorite spurs
[16104.14s -> 16108.94s]  Would be stealthed. I don't know why this quest is
[16113.90s -> 16116.06s]  Yeah, why are we I thought we're doing the dachshund quest
[16119.05s -> 16121.69s]  They're supposed to be crocodiles like in the area above
[16122.57s -> 16125.71s]  No, I think he's or alligators
[16126.49s -> 16128.67s]  Well, we can do both. What's the difference?
[16129.31s -> 16131.65s]  I actually don't know which ones are native to america
[16134.01s -> 16136.01s]  Lots of stuff to collect
[16141.40s -> 16143.64s]  Getting hurt that was a new rooster fighter
[16144.44s -> 16146.44s]  What's hurting us? I keep oh
[16146.84s -> 16149.08s]  Something's bumping into us or hurting us
[16153.80s -> 16155.55s]  No
[16155.55s -> 16157.55s]  My character's making sounds like I was getting hurt
[16162.75s -> 16164.75s]  Fine
[16169.85s -> 16174.09s]  Where's all the like throw the weapons from far cry five if roosters start coming out of the walls
[16176.17s -> 16182.73s]  They took out they took out throw weapons and they took out the car with the back doors that could open and trap helicopters in them
[16183.37s -> 16185.61s]  Why is windows telling me to switch my language?
[16186.33s -> 16189.34s]  I just changed my input language
[16190.44s -> 16191.32s]  what
[16191.32s -> 16207.45s]  Smith's something going on down here
[16215.13s -> 16218.89s]  Is this like a turkey over here? There's a there's like a big rooster turkey chicken over here
[16219.69s -> 16222.57s]  Oh, good luck king rooster
[16222.73s -> 16227.84s]  Do we have to fight it?
[16227.84s -> 16229.84s]  The animals are angry
[16229.92s -> 16235.74s]  I'm trying to get this a good cinematic angle
[16237.96s -> 16240.52s]  oh what was
[16240.52s -> 16242.52s]  That was uh, anticlimactic
[16243.00s -> 16245.20s]  oh
[16245.20s -> 16248.16s]  My cat just kind of unceremoniously wait
[16252.24s -> 16254.19s]  um
[16254.19s -> 16256.19s]  Escape the bunker. Yeah, there was a bunch of them
[16270.36s -> 16272.36s]  My familiar has taken this quest
[16273.54s -> 16276.44s]  Objectives you've got to pay to win cat. That's not fair
[16281.13s -> 16283.32s]  I think this is supposed to be
[16283.32s -> 16285.88s]  Intense. No, I think this is supposed to be a horror
[16286.52s -> 16289.04s]  hallway parody
[16289.04s -> 16291.04s]  Yeah, that was kind of funny. Let's go
[16296.01s -> 16304.00s]  Dps press v. No, not in here
[16304.64s -> 16314.22s]  It smells like shit get out get out get out get out man get out
[16333.58s -> 16335.58s]  Okay, I think um
[16336.06s -> 16345.04s]  Don't leave me in here
[16345.04s -> 16346.64s]  Dude, get him. Watch out
[16346.64s -> 16348.33s]  All right, we did it
[16348.33s -> 16349.53s]  nice work
[16349.53s -> 16359.32s]  Let's head back to very very dramatic music
[16360.12s -> 16365.10s]  Okay objective complete
[16367.71s -> 16369.15s]  Place
[16369.15s -> 16371.15s]  shit birds everywhere
[16371.79s -> 16374.59s]  This must be crocodiles here though a chicken put a bullet in me
[16381.04s -> 16383.04s]  That's 2 000 meters away. Oh my god
[16384.22s -> 16385.66s]  That's not
[16385.66s -> 16387.42s]  That's just the turning
[16387.42s -> 16390.36s]  So where's the the alligators are right here somewhere, right?
[16391.71s -> 16393.47s]  Like it. Yeah
[16393.47s -> 16400.01s]  I found chorizo's recipe. They should be well try and make it for him. No, they're down here
[16405.95s -> 16412.51s]  Uh, i'm not insignificant distance away that's very far that's further than oh my god, it's so far
[16412.51s -> 16419.47s]  I don't know how this I feel like i'm driving the car. Okay, uh
[16420.27s -> 16422.27s]  Your mark my worst ass
[16423.95s -> 16425.31s]  Oh, sorry
[16425.31s -> 16430.01s]  that better
[16430.01s -> 16432.88s]  Careful with your
[16432.88s -> 16452.03s]  I'm good. I think they're gonna spike strip us. I think so
[16453.07s -> 16455.07s]  Oh
[16455.39s -> 16459.48s]  It worked
[16459.48s -> 16468.25s]  emerging gameplay
[16468.57s -> 16471.45s]  Pick up the goddamn purse. What the hell? All right
[16472.25s -> 16481.64s]  I am guarding the alarm. I think we're okay now
[16482.57s -> 16485.07s]  The alarm should be broken now, right?
[16485.23s -> 16486.91s]  Uh, I think so
[16486.91s -> 16495.34s]  Is it like one more guy?
[16495.34s -> 16497.26s]  I think that's it
[16497.26s -> 16499.34s]  I think if we kill all the guys we control the checkpoint
[16503.92s -> 16509.85s]  Oh something in here
[16509.85s -> 16511.50s]  We got
[16511.50s -> 16514.14s]  Gun powder. I think gunpowder lets you make guns
[16514.78s -> 16517.42s]  Oh, all right. It's probably just like crafting the tank again
[16518.46s -> 16519.82s]  I'm just hiding
[16519.82s -> 16523.26s]  He's hiding here
[16523.26s -> 16525.98s]  Let's just do the left for dead strategy where everyone goes in the bathroom
[16528.35s -> 16530.51s]  And everyone aims out the door with auto shotguns
[16531.15s -> 16537.98s]  I don't think he knows
[16537.98s -> 16544.28s]  Is he leaving he's investigating sort of and also crashing
[16546.30s -> 16551.16s]  Maybe becoming stuck
[16551.16s -> 16553.16s]  Looks like he's stuck. I think we can go
[16556.19s -> 16558.19s]  Yeah, he's stuck. All right, let's get out of here
[16561.93s -> 16572.40s]  I mean I can steal the horse, but let's get the car. I missed whatever
[16575.85s -> 16581.23s]  Take this one. Oh
[16581.79s -> 16583.79s]  Don't just keep driving
[16585.18s -> 16587.18s]  I don't just keep driving
[16593.68s -> 16606.41s]  You're just rolling up
[16606.41s -> 16608.41s]  This thing doesn't do shit
[16609.50s -> 16613.82s]  All right movie, uh, you you can jump on the roof of mine. I gotta get the shot. Come on
[16626.76s -> 16629.00s]  All right. I agree a movie scene has to play out here
[16629.72s -> 16632.51s]  A movie scene you're expecting a lot
[16634.11s -> 16637.55s]  Hey, let's go to do a movie scene in front of the camera. Hey, uh
[16638.67s -> 16646.04s]  Do something funny
[16646.04s -> 16676.08s]  Oh, that's a great shot great angle actually perfect shot right here. Okay. I got an idea nice and tight right there
[16679.05s -> 16684.00s]  That actually scared the shit out of me that startled me. I thought he crashed into like a wall
[16692.24s -> 16695.32s]  Cut yeah, good shot. Good scene
[16698.08s -> 16702.80s]  On to the crocodile meat
[16702.80s -> 16709.23s]  You drive. Okay. Thank you italics. Now we don't have to do that for an hour
[16710.19s -> 16713.71s]  X is gun. Oh cool
[16715.04s -> 16717.04s]  Uh, you kind of put this in a ditch here
[16717.69s -> 16720.41s]  I mean I dove out of the car. It just went where it was going to go
[16721.76s -> 16724.80s]  I think we may need a new one. No, we're okay
[16729.50s -> 16734.14s]  The scooper on front is supposed to flip cars, but it doesn't seem to work
[16735.02s -> 16739.50s]  I don't this happened. You just came to a complete stop. Why?
[16741.34s -> 16744.14s]  Instantly the engine just fell out of the car
[16747.10s -> 16749.34s]  I think i'm hitting you
[16749.34s -> 16755.50s]  I think i'm running into you my power as host is simply too great. It might be your shield
[16756.54s -> 16758.54s]  Wait, I didn't want to hit all those chickens
[16758.54s -> 16762.83s]  That's actually a good idea. What if I what if you run to me at full speed while I have a shield equipped?
[16763.87s -> 16765.47s]  You block it
[16765.47s -> 16770.91s]  I don't know. That's what I wanted to find out your uh legs are doing lots of interesting things
[16771.71s -> 16782.68s]  You want to try it?
[16782.68s -> 16785.48s]  Now you get all the hold your shield up and put it right in front of the car
[16786.12s -> 16800.41s]  It works
[16800.41s -> 16802.41s]  Are you serious? Are you kidding me?
[16803.37s -> 16805.69s]  No, it does not hang on. I wonder if it works with the tank
[16811.93s -> 16814.41s]  This i'm fine
[16814.41s -> 16826.49s]  That shouldn't work
[16827.84s -> 16831.04s]  You dodged the horse good job. I did I don't want to hit the horse
[16840.46s -> 16842.46s]  This marvel movie is whack
[16843.18s -> 16845.18s]  parried a truck
[16858.00s -> 16859.84s]  Uh, we gotta try like a
[16859.84s -> 16861.12s]  airplane
[16861.12s -> 16863.12s]  I I know but it blocks explosions
[16863.84s -> 16866.96s]  Oh if I flew into you with an airplane, would you block it? That's a good idea
[16867.60s -> 16869.44s]  It's a really good idea
[16869.44s -> 16872.24s]  Let's try that in a little bit
[16872.24s -> 16878.96s]  What happens if I hit v while you're driving?
[16879.60s -> 16882.96s]  It'll probably blow the car up and we'll have to get to a loading screen and be mad at the area
[16883.52s -> 16888.57s]  I can
[16888.65s -> 16890.65s]  You got hit by a barrel
[16892.54s -> 16894.54s]  All right, uh go fast or
[16895.10s -> 16897.23s]  Yeah, we gotta go this way
[16897.23s -> 16900.14s]  All right, go fast
[16900.14s -> 16902.14s]  Yeah, i'm just gonna hit v
[16903.04s -> 16905.69s]  going fast
[16905.69s -> 16907.69s]  You're still on the car. It works
[16911.24s -> 16917.48s]  Uh newton's law of physics says that a perpetual motion something will be in motion until it is out of motion
[16917.80s -> 16921.96s]  When I was a young boy and what I played with trains, I sure did love them
[16923.52s -> 16929.44s]  My sister was a very interesting person. That's the first 15 seconds of young sheldon. Thank you very much
[16934.88s -> 16938.00s]  It was literally the first like 30 seconds of young sheldon episode 1 pilot
[16938.32s -> 16943.94s]  Yeah, but it sounded like the right man in the wrong place can make all the different
[16944.88s -> 16947.72s]  stuff
[16947.72s -> 16950.92s]  They're just dropping like paratroopers down here. Are they firing at us?
[16956.54s -> 16959.10s]  I'm very confused who they're shooting at. Yeah, they're shooting at us. Why what happened?
[16959.82s -> 16961.82s]  We're just here. We exist
[16961.82s -> 16966.38s]  They don't need a reason
[16966.38s -> 16967.82s]  Well, what the heck?
[16967.82s -> 16969.82s]  I have a shield. Why don't you get one?
[16969.82s -> 16978.70s]  Come on. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal
[16979.87s -> 16988.06s]  heal
[16988.06s -> 16993.18s]  Got him get the helicopter get the helicopter might be able to fly that out
[16993.82s -> 17000.43s]  Give me this fucking thing right now. Come on. Does it let you jump in? No
[17001.39s -> 17009.87s]  What if we get a what if we get a boat and push it?
[17009.95s -> 17012.11s]  Why is it so hard to get a helicopter in this game?
[17012.67s -> 17017.84s]  I mean the way we have access to them is just yeah, they're in weird places shitty one. This is the big one
[17018.16s -> 17020.16s]  So we're looking for um
[17020.24s -> 17022.59s]  crocodiles here
[17022.59s -> 17023.63s]  This one
[17023.63s -> 17027.20s]  Do we are we supposed to kill them?
[17027.20s -> 17044.03s]  What's this look like to you?
[17044.03s -> 17048.03s]  Um, I was I don't know. I was videoing it. I was hoping he was gonna kill you
[17048.91s -> 17053.39s]  I was hoping he was gonna kill you and I was gonna have like a picture of you getting eaten by a crocodile
[17053.39s -> 17086.57s]  But that didn't happen. I got you. Who's this? Oh, dude, there's rats. They're rats
[17087.45s -> 17090.41s]  No, it's not. This is a gopher. Oh shit. Can you can they be friends?
[17092.46s -> 17094.70s]  What is this? How do we uh, can we like press e or anything?
[17095.34s -> 17101.42s]  Like a beaver. I don't think that's like a beaver
[17105.77s -> 17107.77s]  All right. So now we're gonna bring the treat back to auto
[17109.05s -> 17111.23s]  Or midas either one
[17111.23s -> 17113.63s]  Hang on both. Hang on. I just got the option to feed
[17114.35s -> 17115.55s]  Really?
[17115.55s -> 17117.63s]  Yeah, but I can't see it again because they're like scared
[17118.49s -> 17127.95s]  Holy shit
[17127.95s -> 17129.98s]  Damn it
[17129.98s -> 17131.68s]  Maybe we need to sneak up
[17131.68s -> 17133.68s]  I don't know. It definitely said feed
[17133.76s -> 17144.12s]  There's more up ahead. See if you can get the ones, uh, that haven't been like spooked yet. Yeah
[17144.84s -> 17154.33s]  All right. Let's let's let's creep up. Okay. That's a jack rabbits. Why are we like we're like hurting them?
[17154.99s -> 17161.63s]  No, I don't think so. We're trying to feed them. No like h e hard like uh, oh I see like protecting them
[17161.95s -> 17165.02s]  I really hope this doesn't lead to a street
[17165.02s -> 17180.33s]  Pretty game. They're just so squeaky. Oh, here we go. Here's uh, oh, it's a that's a rabbit. Damn it

[17213.02s -> 17222.28s]  pellets
[17222.28s -> 17228.91s]  Uh-oh, we have a there's a predator over there. Oh, there is a wolf just walking around
[17229.23s -> 17239.72s]  Can you feed the wolf if you just like walk up? Can you be hand out? Don't try to feed wolves
[17242.92s -> 17244.92s]  Help help. I don't know what to do
[17246.27s -> 17250.56s]  Run to the water into the water run to the water. He's got my arm. Let's get in the water
[17255.45s -> 17259.37s]  Shooting a gun into the water. He won't go in the water
[17262.62s -> 17263.90s]  Okay
[17263.90s -> 17268.89s]  Yeah, I guess you're right
[17270.25s -> 17274.96s]  Okay, uh new toy we have a new toy there is a new toy

[17298.43s -> 17299.55s]  uh
[17299.55s -> 17302.17s]  Where are we gonna go?
[17302.17s -> 17306.83s]  That's a great question, but we're gonna go somewhere. We'll go somewhere
[17307.39s -> 17327.50s]  Yeah, fuck that dock. Who cares? How do I get out of here? He's all dead ends. I think they're all dead ends
[17329.85s -> 17332.08s]  Give me a marker
[17332.08s -> 17334.08s]  You're just vlogging
[17334.08s -> 17338.27s]  All right. Yeah, all right. I'll give you a marker. Um, we have to go this way
[17341.24s -> 17343.82s]  Hold on
[17343.82s -> 17345.82s]  honeymoon video
[17348.48s -> 17350.49s]  And i'll be honest with you
[17350.49s -> 17355.69s]  Put the phone down right like okay. Oh brothers. We're having so much fun. I'm gonna record this
[17356.65s -> 17358.81s]  No, don't just like enjoy the vacation right here
[17359.61s -> 17366.92s]  Where's the marker? There are designated things to take pictures of don't bring your phone into the water. What is that? Oh, it's an alligator
[17370.88s -> 17373.39s]  Uh, we should just be able to go backwards
[17374.46s -> 17375.82s]  Oh shit
[17375.82s -> 17378.62s]  What's wrong? The alligators. Oh, whoa
[17379.58s -> 17389.64s]  I kind of like want to see what it'll do. Honey. They're getting so close
[17391.71s -> 17392.75s]  Wow
[17392.75s -> 17395.87s]  The wildlife are here is really interesting. I love being in nature
[17396.75s -> 17398.91s]  I want to be out. I want to be outside all the time
[17399.71s -> 17403.61s]  I want to be camping. I want to be hiking
[17403.93s -> 17406.52s]  I want to just sunbathe. I want to go swimming
[17407.40s -> 17416.75s]  My camera's like broken. Oh, what's this over here? What this is?
[17418.99s -> 17420.99s]  Uh, I don't know
[17425.61s -> 17427.61s]  Let's go to like a safe
[17427.69s -> 17431.85s]  distance right here
[17432.41s -> 17435.05s]  I don't think they even care. They're stuck. Do you want to go help them?
[17447.20s -> 17452.80s]  Can you get on their boat and will they even care I well depends on if they notice me, I guess
[17453.12s -> 17460.99s]  Try to stealth up there. I think you can stealth up there and take the guy out with
[17462.11s -> 17465.47s]  See if you can wait see if you can go on the boat and like just sit on with them
[17466.19s -> 17472.11s]  What if I can do one of the like swimming machete animations where you like there's got to be one to pull a guy off the boat
[17472.11s -> 17474.11s]  Right. I would hope so
[17482.20s -> 17486.62s]  He's aiming the gun around the boat at you he doesn't want to get off
[17487.82s -> 17493.64s]  I see that
[17494.20s -> 17496.49s]  You're having your camera
[17496.49s -> 17501.45s]  Yeah, come over to this side around this thing. See if you can get him to like point around his left shoulder
[17508.28s -> 17509.88s]  Like they're just grooving
[17509.88s -> 17514.68s]  I feel like i'm taking a picture of you like filming a movie or doing like a photo shoot
[17515.08s -> 17517.52s]  Okay, they see me when I get like
[17517.60s -> 17523.28s]  There if I go if I go up there they can see too. So I can't will he fire the gun?
[17523.84s -> 17526.89s]  It's actually a good question
[17526.89s -> 17530.97s]  If you were to stand up like around the left side of the boat. All right about to get detected. Let's find out
[17531.37s -> 17535.10s]  I can't jump
[17535.10s -> 17546.28s]  Too i'm too puny. He can definitely fire if he wanted to right now go stand right next to him
[17546.60s -> 17552.80s]  I can't even like get up here. All right. Give me one sec to reset my uh
[17553.88s -> 17562.12s]  Stealth meter. Okay, i'm filming you i'm filming you
[17564.73s -> 17566.73s]  Okay, you're up there. Nice
[17566.97s -> 17576.00s]  very cool
[17583.02s -> 17585.02s]  That didn't do anything
[17586.14s -> 17588.14s]  Nothing killed me. What the fuck?
[17589.48s -> 17607.68s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What happened? I did like a backflip off the I hope this loads please load. Come on. We're not done yet
[17608.32s -> 17615.64s]  Yes
[17615.64s -> 17621.26s]  You're going you're going on facebook. Can we like eat these?
[17626.43s -> 17630.51s]  I don't think so. All right, let's go feed the uh, feed the dog. Let's actually finish that
[17631.15s -> 17638.92s]  Like you said I said then yep. I'm gonna call in a car
[17639.63s -> 17644.46s]  That would probably be useful when do I get to like call in other cars?
[17646.46s -> 17653.40s]  You probably have to set it find in a warehouse at the fnd storage facility complete any grand
[17654.02s -> 17669.08s]  Premio race or go to a chop shop. Okay. Oh my gosh. Look at this. Oh, I thought he's biting this whatever it was
[17671.29s -> 17675.10s]  Hey, thanks. All right, you want to drive?
[17676.72s -> 17685.05s]  Uh, do you okay? Yeah, you can drive. I've been driving a lot. Why is he pissed?
[17686.86s -> 17690.68s]  Is he yeah, he didn't he just brought the car to us and he was mad because he has to walk
[17691.32s -> 17695.00s]  This is unfair. Why can't oh, why can't that guy just not be in the car with us and you drop him off?
[17695.63s -> 17700.11s]  I don't know what happened. Yeah, there's no like other no familiar people in this game like we you can like
[17701.47s -> 17705.02s]  Get followers. It seems really unfair
[17720.20s -> 17721.64s]  What?
[17721.64s -> 17724.44s]  Why would you run her or she could have gotten in the car? I thought she was bad
[17725.24s -> 17727.74s]  She's not bad. Is this guy bad?
[17731.45s -> 17733.31s]  Yeah, he's bad
[17733.31s -> 17735.55s]  All right, pick up pick her up and let her get in the car
[17745.77s -> 17747.05s]  All right, let's go
[17747.05s -> 17749.63s]  this way
[17749.63s -> 17753.31s]  In the cop
[17753.31s -> 17755.79s]  Point your phone out the window like a hipster vlog
[17756.43s -> 17760.00s]  She's not getting in the car
[17760.00s -> 17770.32s]  Can I lean out?
[17770.32s -> 17782.41s]  Okay, let's just go take you out
[17783.05s -> 17788.48s]  Good. Excellent
[17788.48s -> 17790.48s]  Can you do a selfie? I don't think so
[17792.00s -> 17794.08s]  put away zoom toggle ui
[17795.04s -> 17796.40s]  No, you can't
[17796.40s -> 17808.48s]  What happened there?
[17808.48s -> 17810.48s]  Why is there a skull flying around in the sky?
[17811.04s -> 17814.46s]  There's a skull in the sky. I think that means there's like a
[17815.18s -> 17818.38s]  It's not a new sea of thieves event. I don't know. I never played it
[17819.26s -> 17822.60s]  Probably where jack black is
[17822.60s -> 17827.13s]  I said, I wouldn't be surprised if this is just the last game flipped upside down
[17828.32s -> 17831.60s]  Well, they just like flip horizontally every asset
[17835.79s -> 17837.79s]  They broke my tires
[17840.96s -> 17857.72s]  Where's the other guy I don't see anybody where are they anybody marked?
[17859.00s -> 17861.08s]  No, I don't we're not are we marking people
[17866.68s -> 17872.28s]  They got planes do if we we just gotta leave because they got the alarm run run run out. There's gonna be more people
[17874.27s -> 17879.63s]  It's only gonna get exacerbated. I'm good. It is explosives back here. Just be aware of that be careful. I have almost zero health
[17880.43s -> 17883.74s]  I'm dead
[17883.74s -> 17889.21s]  I can't get out of the fucking back seat of this car
[17890.09s -> 17905.05s]  I'm just running. I'm sorry. You'll spawn on me. All right, i'm out. Oh, there's a spectator bug
[17905.53s -> 17912.89s]  All right, I got away
[17912.89s -> 17915.05s]  I wonder if when you do you you probably just spawn right on me
[17919.80s -> 17921.80s]  And we're
[17922.62s -> 17925.68s]  Back. Yeah, that's a much better idea
[17926.40s -> 17928.96s]  What the fuck is this thing?
[17928.96s -> 17930.08s]  ferret
[17930.08s -> 17933.00s]  Why is it mad?
[17933.00s -> 17935.20s]  What did I do?
[17935.20s -> 17938.34s]  Because humans have corrupted their natural environments
[17939.12s -> 17942.65s]  There's a mongoose
[17942.65s -> 17951.02s]  What are you shooting at?
[17951.34s -> 17954.99s]  What's even down there? I'm just gonna get a car
[17956.76s -> 17959.88s]  Found one hold on this guy have a quest
[17962.97s -> 17968.12s]  Holy shit
[17968.12s -> 17973.31s]  No, don't shoot me
[17973.31s -> 17982.27s]  All right, I get it. I'm in. All right, let's head. We're just trying to feed the goddamn dachshund. Okay
[17983.23s -> 18000.30s]  Helicopter you turn it around of course a tank
[18002.62s -> 18003.82s]  He's aiming
[18003.82s -> 18006.57s]  He ain't gonna hit him. He's not he's aiming
[18008.73s -> 18011.77s]  I'd be surprised he literally just disappeared off the map. We're good
[18013.44s -> 18027.84s]  They tend to do that
[18027.84s -> 18029.84s]  Are you yet? No, I
[18030.81s -> 18031.69s]  Oh
[18031.69s -> 18033.85s]  I just I did the waypoints wrong
[18038.99s -> 18042.35s]  I was trying to cut through here because the waypoint is taking us somewhere else
[18045.56s -> 18049.26s]  Look at the this is the wrong way. We need to put the waypoint waypoint
[18051.34s -> 18055.74s]  Okay, i'll give you some waypoints because i'm driving towards this waypoint here. You see my waypoint
[18057.80s -> 18058.92s]  Yeah, it's it
[18058.92s -> 18066.38s]  So now we have to go this way
[18066.38s -> 18075.85s]  All right, the moment that everyone's been waiting for
[18076.01s -> 18079.07s]  It's finally among us
[18079.07s -> 18081.21s]  Why why?
[18081.21s -> 18084.01s]  I can't say two words that are very common together
[18084.73s -> 18086.78s]  without it being
[18086.78s -> 18090.06s]  A video game everybody likes. I don't think it contextually even made sense
[18101.74s -> 18106.88s]  You know, you're probably right
[18106.88s -> 18109.18s]  What am I doing?
[18109.18s -> 18110.78s]  Excuse me
[18110.78s -> 18118.97s]  Why did this happen?
[18118.97s -> 18120.97s]  Okay. Well, let's go feed the dog
[18127.88s -> 18132.68s]  I am so ready for this
[18132.76s -> 18134.04s]  feeding the dog
[18134.04s -> 18136.14s]  Crocodile steak
[18136.14s -> 18139.02s]  Are you okay? Are you gonna be able to see it? I think so
[18139.74s -> 18141.74s]  As long as i'm close probably, right?
[18146.54s -> 18149.16s]  So hard for my god
[18150.04s -> 18160.33s]  Should be enough to make us amigos, right? We did it. He's so hungry
[18165.28s -> 18167.28s]  He's no you have to eat the rest of the food
[18168.16s -> 18170.56s]  I he doesn't want to buy you the good stuff. You have to eat the rest of it
[18171.20s -> 18172.32s]  but
[18172.32s -> 18174.32s]  Not hungry. It's okay

[18226.65s -> 18230.17s]  Dogs been stealing shit through the whole community and like burying it in corners
[18240.30s -> 18245.04s]  Even more well that wasn't really hidden
[18246.68s -> 18248.68s]  It was just on the counter serious key
[18258.52s -> 18261.56s]  Okay, but like what if he was one of the attack companions?
[18262.36s -> 18266.36s]  He's so funny

[18286.56s -> 18288.00s]  Now he's not
[18288.00s -> 18291.45s]  He probably helped you steal this shit
[18293.05s -> 18296.65s]  I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. He's got a name tag
[18297.21s -> 18299.44s]  Really?
[18299.44s -> 18301.52s]  Yeah, so you can equip his name tag
[18302.08s -> 18305.85s]  That way you remember him anywhere you go
[18307.36s -> 18310.16s]  Just put like a cute dachshund in your game and everyone won't care about

[18358.75s -> 18363.23s]  Pepe laugh co-op. Are you kidding me?
[18363.87s -> 18369.50s]  Oh, it's on cooldown. I can't even get the dog
[18371.85s -> 18377.21s]  I'm just like trapped. I'm trapped like in a mirror or something. Like I know here's what it is. Um
[18377.85s -> 18381.61s]  You're holding the controller that's not plugged
[18384.00s -> 18387.04s]  And pretending like you're playing while i'm playing
[18390.00s -> 18391.36s]  What the fuck?
[18391.36s -> 18402.48s]  All right, let's keep going. How are you doing? You're you doing good. You're right. I'm good
[18402.56s -> 18405.68s]  I just I just got our our little friend who actually exists
[18407.52s -> 18411.18s]  Here he is. Oh my goodness. I can't believe it
[18413.26s -> 18415.26s]  I can't believe you can actually you but but
[18415.82s -> 18417.66s]  what if he gets like
[18417.66s -> 18423.02s]  Attacked he's gonna get like a you're gonna throw a grenade and it's gonna be bad. Just go to sleep in the puddle
[18425.47s -> 18428.59s]  He's sleeping inside of the mud puddle. We have to protect
[18429.23s -> 18430.83s]  This dog at all costs
[18430.83s -> 18440.62s]  All right, bring the spurs back. All right, where's the crafting bench? Let's make some new toys. We'll complete this first
[18441.18s -> 18442.94s]  because we we've had this
[18442.94s -> 18444.94s]  Pretty much completed for like an hour
[18458.04s -> 18460.80s]  I just can't stand the idea
[18467.90s -> 18474.65s]  Now you did us a favor and I trust you but if you say anything to anyone
[18475.37s -> 18482.03s]  I'll fuck you up a challenger approaches

[18486.19s -> 18488.25s]  Give my quest reward
[18488.25s -> 18490.25s]  You think I did that the goodest of my heart?
[18491.74s -> 18493.82s]  We got it right there. Look gonna be rank four
[18497.37s -> 18500.65s]  Okay, new weapons and gear at arms daily, let's go look at some new weapons
[18504.06s -> 18506.06s]  Uh, we should be able to craft some shit
[18507.72s -> 18510.76s]  Well, you should be able to craft some shit in your cool game that you have
[18511.24s -> 18516.28s]  No, you can't anybody can craft stuff. We just gotta find the crafting table. No, I can't I know I can't I can't I can't
[18518.35s -> 18522.11s]  I can't I don't even want to look mentally. No, I can't I don't even want to look it's stupid. I can't do it
[18533.36s -> 18535.36s]  I actually don't think I can
[18537.47s -> 18539.47s]  I can go I can can I talk to this guy?
[18540.81s -> 18544.57s]  Listen i'll just I could throw one of my weapons on the ground and you can pick it up
[18545.37s -> 18548.17s]  Uh, it's all right, man. I just uh, that's fine. It's cool
[18549.05s -> 18551.93s]  As I can't do it. I genuinely don't even know where the crafting bench is
[18553.48s -> 18557.24s]  Yeah, just make a bunch of like shit. Whatever. It's fine. I don't care. Yeah, you know what? Um
[18558.04s -> 18559.08s]  um
[18559.08s -> 18561.24s]  It is it is more fun with my 15 game
[18563.52s -> 18567.92s]  All right, that means fucking it's like low low price of 15 dollars, you know, it's pretty good deal
[18570.30s -> 18572.30s]  Sorry, just make something fucking whatever
[18576.16s -> 18585.04s]  Yeah
[18585.04s -> 18588.43s]  Oh fucking probably uh
[18589.16s -> 18595.48s]  I'm building my i'm building my base. Yeah. Hang on. I gotta wait for your approval though. You said no
[18596.68s -> 18600.60s]  You need uh, you need my approval. Okay, let me um, let me deliberate on this
[18606.14s -> 18623.77s]  Oh, this is I thought this was gonna sell weapons. They sell clothes clothes
[18628.99s -> 18630.59s]  I'll give you one sec
[18630.59s -> 18633.87s]  Got a raid from uh chibli. Thanks for the raid chibli
[18636.28s -> 18638.28s]  What's going on everybody? Thanks for joining
[18638.68s -> 18646.65s]  Playing far cry six my buddy italics. How are you guys doing?
[18649.55s -> 18659.21s]  I have italics muted in deafens and he probably doesn't know what's going on. But thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. So um,
[18660.97s -> 18663.39s]  Where do you want to go from here? What would you like to do?
[18665.20s -> 18667.68s]  uh
[18667.68s -> 18671.92s]  I'll let you choose because I feel like um, you know, my my game's kind of better than yours
[18671.92s -> 18677.77s]  I've got the the dachshund dog pet. Um, I got a premium weapons. I've got the
[18678.97s -> 18683.37s]  Awesome clothes. Yeah, I mean it's it's a better game mary guy. It's a cooler game
[18683.45s -> 18688.57s]  But I think like we can do what you kind of feel like because you're the one that has to be the quarterback here
[18691.88s -> 18696.44s]  Yeah, you do have a point. I mean anything we do really doesn't impact your save at all
[18697.47s -> 18701.63s]  Um, even though you own the game and uh, I technically i'm renting it. So
[18703.07s -> 18706.11s]  No, let's go do uh, let's go. I want to fly a plane. I want to be in a plane
[18706.35s -> 18708.83s]  Somebody just somebody just throw a glass at the dog
[18709.87s -> 18717.40s]  Who the fuck just did that who did that? All right, let's go fly a plane spawn a plane and I want to fly it
[18718.22s -> 18720.25s]  Okay
[18720.25s -> 18724.64s]  just
[18724.64s -> 18726.64s]  What's this controller icon?
[18731.76s -> 18734.76s]  I don't wait. What is it? Yeah indirect. Oh
[18735.32s -> 18742.27s]  It's uh their dlc aren't these just characters from the other games?
[18742.83s -> 18747.79s]  Yeah, I think that for some reason is somehow the also you okay if you don't move
[18747.87s -> 18754.27s]  I literally can't finish the game like if you went afk right here. Yeah, I am 100% boxed in
[18755.23s -> 18757.23s]  Really
[18757.39s -> 18763.72s]  There's no jumping in this mug you just stuck you just you just put me in a minecraft like dirt
[18764.46s -> 18769.76s]  Dark hut while I was uh using the bathroom. Oh, all right. Let's get in the plane
[18770.08s -> 18784.43s]  What time is right now? When do we start too? I got like another 40 minutes in me. Let's get let's get some new vehicles and weapons
[18784.67s -> 18789.98s]  We gotta get new toys. I'm I like I can't there's a crafting bench in there somewhere
[18789.98s -> 18790.94s]  I don't know where it is
[18790.94s -> 18799.79s]  There's a helicopter now or there was then but there is now too and we have two can we have two different vehicles
[18800.36s -> 18802.52s]  Okay, so uh you you want the plane?
[18803.00s -> 18807.32s]  Why don't we know I want the helicopter? Okay, well pick pick one. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[18807.64s -> 18813.26s]  Let's try the shield thing. That's a good idea. How are we gonna do this?
[18813.74s -> 18815.74s]  Where are you gonna be? I'm just gonna go to the end of the runway
[18821.88s -> 18828.84s]  I have to like pitch this down then all right. The plane is currently moving so I can't really stop it
[18829.00s -> 18831.23s]  All right, just accelerate. All right. Here we go
[18839.96s -> 18844.57s]  Not bad time didn't save me that time. I'm all right
[18847.90s -> 18849.90s]  Spawn in here. Yeah
[18851.55s -> 18856.99s]  Like round you up. All right, where to can't you like a grapple onto stuff?
[18858.54s -> 18860.78s]  That's the grapple still in the game. That's just cause
[18861.66s -> 18868.22s]  No, no, no, that's far cry five was we were doing like a grapple onto the helicopter. Remember we were trying to like um
[18869.90s -> 18871.42s]  Do the physics bounce?
[18871.42s -> 18874.70s]  Oh, I don't know. Maybe if the helicopter blades probably have to unlock it
[18875.26s -> 18881.31s]  So i'm going to a waypoint right now. What's this waypoint for?
[18890.84s -> 18896.86s]  I don't I don't know what to do. I'm panicking. I actually don't I like forgot how to drive the fucking plane. I don't know what to do
[18898.65s -> 18901.05s]  Why can't I not move my mouth? I can't move my mouth
[18901.69s -> 18903.69s]  Just get out just get out just get out
[18904.57s -> 18914.81s]  You're good
[18914.81s -> 18920.52s]  Yes
[18920.52s -> 18926.32s]  Did you shoot at me? How are you so much higher than me? All right, try and shoot this
[18933.12s -> 18934.91s]  I can't look down
[18934.91s -> 18939.32s]  There you are. I'm gonna try to i'm gonna try and make a cool landing in front of you. Okay?
[18940.25s -> 18957.56s]  Okay, just stay still we get this on camera, right? Like pull out your camera. All right, here we come
[18959.74s -> 18970.20s]  That's it. It doesn't look like you're going towards me. I am I never vibe me. That was fun
[18970.60s -> 18981.77s]  I was gonna try to land on your camera lens, but that would have been really really probably impossible to do
[18982.01s -> 18984.01s]  I I didn't even have the camera out
[18984.94s -> 18986.84s]  And what happened there?
[18986.84s -> 18989.08s]  He just walked right into my trap
[18989.08s -> 18993.96s]  I set that up like I was waiting for you to like land there so I could blow you up when you when you landed
[18994.04s -> 18996.04s]  But since you didn't land there
[18996.28s -> 19001.23s]  I had to leave the trap out so that then you just ran right over it. I couldn't pass up the opportunity
[19001.95s -> 19004.27s]  Yeah
[19004.27s -> 19016.80s]  I had to salvage it. It's okay. I made sure chorizo was oh my the explosion. I got blood
[19016.88s -> 19022.94s]  Oh, no, that's disgusting. I've got the blood all over my hands. That's gross. He's healing the wounds
[19026.70s -> 19030.38s]  All right. What do you want to do for the last like 30 40 minutes to an hour or something? Uh,
[19033.60s -> 19037.68s]  Let's take a look. We're gonna we're gonna give ourselves an objective. I don't think we even have one
[19040.86s -> 19041.50s]  How do okay?
[19041.50s -> 19047.50s]  We need to figure out how to build the gorilla garrison because like everything fun is locked behind the gorilla garrison
[19048.70s -> 19050.94s]  There's we got there's rocket launchers
[19052.00s -> 19053.84s]  There's bows
[19053.84s -> 19059.44s]  There's like seven shotguns four sniper rifles like every single thing is tied to that
[19059.68s -> 19064.44s]  Okay, but do we have any indicator where to go for that?
[19068.16s -> 19075.16s]  Uh, I think it's supposed to be in the camp, but I probably already like I don't know what's down here
[19076.57s -> 19079.53s]  You can find them in military out installations, too
[19079.85s -> 19086.22s]  Because there's this cortina weather station military target vehicle pickup points
[19088.73s -> 19098.49s]  There is this one over here, which is the tobacco factory military target there's a town over here
[19102.46s -> 19107.26s]  You can't turn the stream off until you get on an airplane and try to just fly to the bad guy's hq to kill him
[19110.33s -> 19117.40s]  Um, we'll try that alex you up for a challenge to like just fly
[19117.80s -> 19122.88s]  Across to the to rank eight and try to kill the guy with like a sniper headshot in the head fly to rank eight
[19124.09s -> 19129.39s]  Yeah, just fly across. Okay. Sure. Where's the guy? All right, so hit go to your map. Uh-huh
[19130.03s -> 19135.87s]  Uh, oh like the top. Yeah, just go fly to his like compound. Um
[19136.43s -> 19146.08s]  El presidente we'll just get in a plane. You're gonna drive because you're much better than I am. Okay fly across this
[19146.64s -> 19155.53s]  This is gonna be like day z level travel time. I mean we could try it
[19155.53s -> 19159.45s]  Maybe we can maybe if we fly like out of bounds or something we can fly around and land
[19159.69s -> 19173.05s]  Okay, try it. I didn't mean to click that. All right. Well, how do we get how do we get a plane?
[19174.97s -> 19176.17s]  Yeah, that's restricted airspace
[19176.17s -> 19179.37s]  But can we like avoid the restricted airspace by flying like around the ocean or something?
[19187.61s -> 19192.75s]  I think we probably need to fast travel. What about like a um, what about like a jet ski? That might work
[19196.38s -> 19199.60s]  Yeah, maybe a jet ski might do it if we go to the dock here
[19202.72s -> 19205.68s]  You actually might be onto something seriously if we go around the entire map here
[19206.08s -> 19213.13s]  Okay, let's go west to that marker. I'll call in just like a regular car
[19218.62s -> 19221.10s]  And then the marker there's like a dock there could be a boat
[19226.73s -> 19232.73s]  Okay, this is kind of stupid turn around run down this hill and slide like down down the slope and just hold
[19233.85s -> 19237.07s]  Well, that's fun
[19237.07s -> 19243.20s]  You can almost do the entire go. Okay. Let's go
[19243.92s -> 19248.01s]  You guys are gonna stop the whole war
[19250.40s -> 19254.48s]  I mean, we're gonna see what happens. It's worth a shot a few good minutes
[19255.04s -> 19265.16s]  Why does it always end up like this?
[19265.16s -> 19273.45s]  It always ends up like this
[19273.45s -> 19279.85s]  okay, and
[19280.17s -> 19285.29s]  I'm kind of just hoping that there is a boat of some kind right? Yeah spike strips
[19294.04s -> 19296.04s]  This car is not doing very well
[19297.40s -> 19299.88s]  But nice job dodges. I just dodged the spike strips
[19300.76s -> 19303.08s]  Smoking a little bit though for some did we get shot?
[19303.88s -> 19305.40s]  I think we may have
[19305.40s -> 19316.64s]  Is there a third person view? I don't think so only in the camp
[19321.55s -> 19323.55s]  That guy spawned and you killed him
[19325.76s -> 19331.44s]  Okay, it just occurred to me that little chorizo I spoke turn little chorizo is like following us
[19332.00s -> 19335.58s]  Yeah, just running on the road
[19335.58s -> 19338.38s]  If you can like do a wheelie on the slopes
[19349.60s -> 19351.71s]  Very nice
[19351.71s -> 19353.45s]  That's a cowl
[19353.45s -> 19355.45s]  I thought that was a routine bison
[19363.50s -> 19365.90s]  Those windshield wipers are sure helping us right now
[19367.05s -> 19368.65s]  Keeping the smoke down
[19368.65s -> 19371.48s]  Just to flip
[19371.48s -> 19375.24s]  I was okay. I didn't realize there was a ditch. I was just trying to cut across the grass
[19386.62s -> 19389.58s]  All right, we're almost at water. We're almost there. Oh
[19390.14s -> 19392.76s]  We just to make it to the water
[19393.00s -> 19395.00s]  And oh jesus
[19395.71s -> 19397.39s]  Uh-oh
[19397.39s -> 19399.63s]  Uh, hey come come look at me. All right
[19400.51s -> 19405.28s]  All right. Here's your this is your opportunity go go to the rank eight area and die
[19412.14s -> 19414.30s]  Your body is gone, but your arms are still there
[19415.10s -> 19417.10s]  And you if you swim this way
[19420.36s -> 19421.88s]  You're gonna drown
[19421.88s -> 19424.12s]  No, I my head's above water right now. Is it?
[19424.68s -> 19425.56s]  Yeah
[19425.56s -> 19429.80s]  I could I could be here as long as actually there may not be a way out except drowning
[19430.44s -> 19433.31s]  I'm gonna help you under water though. But if I go under water
[19434.11s -> 19440.11s]  It's a boat over here
[19440.51s -> 19455.98s]  Hang on. I might be able to there's a boat right here. Hold on
[19458.24s -> 19464.09s]  What happened? I'm swimming back up. Are you dying?
[19465.13s -> 19466.75s]  I got a boat. I'm
[19468.03s -> 19470.03s]  Uh-oh now i'm gonna drown
[19470.03s -> 19472.43s]  All right, it's fine. You uh, we're gonna repair this shit
[19472.99s -> 19474.99s]  I'm just under the world
[19476.55s -> 19481.05s]  Grasping for air like a horror movie like I can see reality fourth dimensional
[19481.61s -> 19486.81s]  Through the bookcases and I can see you in the boat having fun and i'm like struggling to get to you
[19487.85s -> 19489.85s]  Alex this boat has a machine gun
[19491.10s -> 19493.10s]  Really? We need to be very aware of that
[19493.34s -> 19497.50s]  Whoa, I think we're gonna be able to get out. I think I think this is the one. It's actually a good boat
[19497.74s -> 19500.56s]  It's really good boat
[19500.64s -> 19507.02s]  And we got to go
[19507.02s -> 19509.07s]  I'm right i'm here
[19509.07s -> 19510.75s]  Okay, we're gonna
[19510.75s -> 19512.11s]  I hate you
[19512.11s -> 19515.23s]  So you're gonna go right we're gonna hit an invisible wall
[19515.79s -> 19517.39s]  Follow the coastline
[19517.39s -> 19519.39s]  We're gonna hit an invisible wall. I think
[19519.39s -> 19524.62s]  Am I going straight here self-defense you go right outside the this little opening
[19529.74s -> 19534.14s]  Somebody just had a sailboat out here. I don't think that's a sailboat. I think they're like coming to get us
[19534.54s -> 19535.66s]  Are they?
[19535.66s -> 19537.82s]  The guy on the left is the guy on the left is
[19539.02s -> 19541.02s]  Hey, you gotta you got a gun
[19541.26s -> 19542.62s]  I do
[19542.62s -> 19544.70s]  You gotta go you gotta drive. I'm going
[19545.50s -> 19556.96s]  There's too much smoke. Oh shit. There's a lot of machine gun boats out here
[19557.52s -> 19560.72s]  There are yeah, this is their way to make it so you don't come over here
[19561.52s -> 19569.72s]  So how far do we need to go?
[19569.72s -> 19571.72s]  Oh, I mean you just keep going
[19573.05s -> 19575.69s]  There's almost no end in sight. I can't look at my map. All right
[19578.27s -> 19580.27s]  Oh, Jesus. Okay
[19580.35s -> 19583.61s]  I'll set a marker for
[19583.61s -> 19586.65s]  I actually can't set markers. I don't think you can no no
[19589.96s -> 19591.96s]  It's like this is an illegal zone
[19593.31s -> 19598.75s]  We're we're beyond the veil at this point as long as we can just trace the outside. I think we'd be fine
[19599.63s -> 19610.68s]  I hope they've run into a destroyer and get vaporized. Hey
[19611.48s -> 19621.28s]  We're doing the uh, what's that rpg where you can win the game?
[19622.65s -> 19624.57s]  like in the in the opening segments like
[19625.37s -> 19627.45s]  Gothic or something. Yeah, something like that
[19628.41s -> 19631.87s]  Whether you just like sprint as fast you can to this one town and like kill the guy
[19639.31s -> 19641.39s]  All right, if we can actually kill the
[19642.51s -> 19644.04s]  Boss
[19644.04s -> 19646.04s]  I don't think he'll even be on the map
[19647.66s -> 19652.86s]  Do even like because we know what region he's in but do we know like we know what his house is. Yeah
[19656.41s -> 19659.61s]  It's probably gonna be a big building it's probably gonna be very clear
[19660.49s -> 19665.80s]  What do you think the odds are that they um?
[19667.32s -> 19670.68s]  Have something that's even better than tanks and choppers probably pretty high right?
[19670.68s -> 19676.92s]  You're about to drive a into an island and b into the bad guys into an island. I got plenty of room
[19677.72s -> 19683.66s]  I got plenty of room. I'm fine
[19683.74s -> 19688.06s]  Just confirm with me that i'm going the right way. I mean they'll look the ai beached their boat
[19688.14s -> 19690.14s]  I'm just saying anything's possible. Okay
[19692.49s -> 19693.84s]  What?
[19693.84s -> 19697.42s]  What what?
[19697.42s -> 19699.66s]  What are you talking about? No get out and push what?
[19700.54s -> 19718.09s]  Just push it. We'll be fine. We can push a little bit more. I think that's okay
[19718.65s -> 19723.29s]  I think we're good
[19723.37s -> 19725.61s]  How did you board this from the edges?
[19731.26s -> 19737.04s]  Where are we? We are actually way closer than I thought we were gonna be we're almost there
[19738.89s -> 19741.15s]  We're like halfway there. Yeah
[19741.15s -> 19744.83s]  Are you gonna are you gonna take the right and go through a little inlet like the little um?
[19746.38s -> 19750.54s]  Oh god, no, we're going that way. Yeah, go around go around tall side. Can you move?
[19751.18s -> 19753.66s]  Yeah, okay, because you're
[19754.86s -> 19760.24s]  An asshole kill him kill him kill him kill this guy
[19761.12s -> 19764.51s]  I
[19765.39s -> 19767.39s]  Beeped at him and he fucking whatever
[19768.35s -> 19773.64s]  He'll just got to kill that guy
[19773.64s -> 19775.64s]  Nice good good work
[19781.96s -> 19786.68s]  Okay, but like boating accidents actually happen like that
[19788.27s -> 19791.95s]  Wow like this you have so much space you go anywhere
[19792.67s -> 19794.67s]  And you're the only other
[19795.58s -> 19801.66s]  Like oil tanker spills
[19801.66s -> 19804.60s]  All right, we're almost there
[19804.60s -> 19807.64s]  Look, we have to we have to be really tactical. We have to be really stealthy too
[19808.20s -> 19812.68s]  No bullshit. No like flying laugh out loud helicopters into the walls or whatever
[19812.68s -> 19815.08s]  No, we're gonna get there and we're gonna sneak to this guy's compound and
[19815.80s -> 19817.80s]  One of us is gonna snipe rival in the head
[19818.04s -> 19821.77s]  All right. I'm gonna I see like a haze on the horizon
[19821.77s -> 19825.45s]  You should probably like veer right a little bit so we don't hit some like water wall
[19826.33s -> 19832.27s]  Do they know dude that guy's got a better gun. That's a better boat
[19833.64s -> 19837.72s]  Far away or is it the same one? Is this same boat or almost sir? I was gonna go. It's just right away
[19838.44s -> 19840.12s]  All right, just keep going
[19840.12s -> 19847.13s]  All right. So you guide me a little bit here because I don't know exactly where i'm going. Okay, you're gonna go. Um
[19850.27s -> 19852.04s]  just kind of
[19852.04s -> 19853.74s]  turn
[19853.74s -> 19859.58s]  To the right side of that island and just kind of follow like this way. Yeah, just follow that
[19860.30s -> 19864.48s]  It's gonna be an lol laughing about a moment
[19866.28s -> 19875.23s]  I know
[19875.23s -> 19877.23s]  So, okay rank is just
[19878.60s -> 19882.20s]  How hard it is relative to your equipment? I believe so
[19883.24s -> 19885.96s]  They they kind of like turned to far cry into an rpg
[19886.92s -> 19889.24s]  Weirdly, we're not supposed to be in this zone
[19889.88s -> 19892.20s]  Yeah, like you have to have okay you have to have the right like
[19893.64s -> 19896.52s]  Level up guns like health bars and all that shit
[19901.12s -> 19902.80s]  All right. So this looks like
[19902.80s -> 19904.88s]  this zone on the right here, I think is
[19905.92s -> 19907.20s]  Zone
[19907.20s -> 19910.32s]  You think it's just that tall building that like kind of cathedral looking building right there
[19912.97s -> 19915.69s]  It actually probably is. Yeah, I assume right
[19921.55s -> 19923.71s]  One of them is a is like a huge hotel
[19925.84s -> 19928.08s]  Okay, so you watch like the first big few
[19931.23s -> 19935.04s]  push
[19935.04s -> 19937.04s]  It's it's the only
[19937.52s -> 19939.52s]  Piece of land here. Of course it is
[19939.68s -> 19942.11s]  There are sharks everywhere. So just be
[19942.59s -> 19946.51s]  Oh my god, we'll go push it. Push it a lot push it. Push it. Push it. Push it. This is bad
[19950.76s -> 19956.67s]  Is this drivable yet? Oh not yet
[19957.47s -> 19972.67s]  Can you drive it? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I can't get him
[19975.40s -> 19980.52s]  I can't get in
[19980.52s -> 19985.08s]  Take their boat take their boat take their I mean i've already shot the hell it's sinking. No, it's not like me
[19986.04s -> 19987.32s]  You can repair it
[19987.32s -> 19994.62s]  There's those sharks are are everywhere. This I mean, I think this one will drive
[19995.42s -> 20000.40s]  You can repair this one
[20000.40s -> 20013.69s]  This is a sure thing. This is absolutely a sure thing. Do I hear a dog a dog?
[20017.24s -> 20019.24s]  Uh, they're like raw
[20019.58s -> 20026.38s]  Why is a baby dog in the waters paddle doing the doggy paddle? He's just in the water. Yeah, he's just in the water
[20032.11s -> 20035.88s]  Ammo
[20035.88s -> 20046.46s]  Get this thing out of here. All right, come to my boat. It's in a good spot. I will protect you
[20046.46s -> 20048.46s]  I'll make sure I shoot the sharks that come near you
[20054.97s -> 20057.45s]  Okay, i'm on your boat. Very good. All right
[20058.17s -> 20062.14s]  Be careful. We don't want to hit the same piece of land
[20064.25s -> 20066.62s]  Very nice. All right. Good. What was that?
[20067.26s -> 20069.26s]  Uh, apparently there is a vehicle weapon
[20069.74s -> 20079.32s]  so much smoke
[20079.80s -> 20086.38s]  Left are we smoking? Hold on. I have to repair this
[20088.12s -> 20097.52s]  Uh boat dealt with I can't get back on the gunner's seat
[20102.59s -> 20105.87s]  The sharks are gonna eat me the sharks are gonna eat me go back
[20110.11s -> 20112.11s]  Don't kill me don't kill me
[20113.80s -> 20115.80s]  Okay, holy shit
[20115.80s -> 20118.84s]  Wait, wait, wait slow down slow down. I need to I need to sit down
[20120.70s -> 20122.70s]  You good? Okay. I'm good
[20123.10s -> 20125.10s]  I just road killed a shark
[20126.35s -> 20130.03s]  And we got the meat for it. He's definitely in that big tower over there
[20130.75s -> 20140.17s]  Okay, so
[20140.17s -> 20142.17s]  Uh, once we get in here
[20142.25s -> 20145.68s]  Because they're like the highest level enemies in the entire game
[20146.72s -> 20150.64s]  If they don't one shot us, we're just gonna no fighting like only run
[20150.88s -> 20153.92s]  Yeah, just just try to get where just try to get what we're trying to get to
[20155.44s -> 20162.52s]  That guy's the guy was on our team. How was I supposed to know that? I'm just look every everything's a threat right now
[20162.52s -> 20164.52s]  We're trying to get to the guy the last guy in the game
[20168.73s -> 20175.44s]  Kind of yeah, no, it's just a seawall. Uh
[20176.32s -> 20177.92s]  boat explosion
[20177.92s -> 20180.35s]  Watch out for the buoy watch out for the buoy
[20180.75s -> 20182.19s]  That wasn't mine
[20182.19s -> 20184.52s]  What do you mean abandoned ship?
[20184.52s -> 20189.08s]  Oh, fuck. No, we're okay. Hold on. How do you uh, those are those are mines?
[20199.07s -> 20200.92s]  No
[20200.92s -> 20203.08s]  What happened you ran into a mine?
[20203.88s -> 20210.12s]  Yeah, but like uh, we were stationary. I didn't expect it to explode twice. Where's this gonna put us? Oh, no
[20211.28s -> 20219.40s]  Shit, I I should have I should have jumped. I was trying to get the other boat the people off the other boat
[20219.72s -> 20225.34s]  Okay, what if we get on a plane and we take that same route around that'll be faster, right?
[20227.13s -> 20233.08s]  We need like okay, uh, we need to get a plane that has a gun. I think the game crashed
[20234.03s -> 20239.63s]  Um, I think we're just so far away from anywhere that it wants to spawn us that it's loading in the game again for the first
[20239.63s -> 20246.96s]  Time but also it it may also bug. Yeah, but
[20249.96s -> 20257.77s]  Oh
[20257.77s -> 20263.66s]  I don't what what exploded the second time?
[20264.30s -> 20269.98s]  I don't think it was a mine. I think they like fired an explosive round. I think the boat was on fire
[20270.94s -> 20273.50s]  From the boat my piloting has a grenade launcher
[20273.98s -> 20278.22s]  So if they had one of those like aimed at us, they could just shoot a grenade launcher. Oh, we were so close
[20279.95s -> 20285.61s]  We were so close
[20285.61s -> 20289.93s]  And also it may have crashed. I think we're I think we're dead in the water here
[20290.81s -> 20293.02s]  Yeah
[20293.02s -> 20297.23s]  Yeah, i'll give it till it completes the circle, but that's it
[20298.57s -> 20299.93s]  And we're out
[20299.93s -> 20303.40s]  Oh
[20303.40s -> 20305.40s]  It got disconnected
[20307.98s -> 20309.98s]  Is far cry six good? No
[20311.92s -> 20316.11s]  Is far cry six worth playing? Yes. Hope that answers your question
[20320.31s -> 20323.53s]  15 for the premium edition on you play
[20329.12s -> 20331.28s]  Far cry six playing it like we are right now
[20332.16s -> 20334.16s]  Is a absolute blast
[20334.56s -> 20343.24s]  Does a six out of ten rating still stand? Yeah, it's not a bad game. It's just
[20344.04s -> 20346.68s]  More exactly what you've played probably three or four times now
[20349.23s -> 20351.47s]  Yeah, it's fun. I seem to remember, uh
[20352.11s -> 20357.26s]  I feel like there's maybe more stuff in this game, but there's more like locked stuff
[20357.74s -> 20362.89s]  Far cry five. I remember we streamed it twice because there was like more stuff to do
[20364.54s -> 20366.86s]  Yeah, I mean granted we are we are not
[20367.98s -> 20373.98s]  Playing the game the way that it may have been intended to be played to be clear. I'm at like stream shit
[20374.06s -> 20377.34s]  Yeah, yeah
[20377.34s -> 20382.32s]  All right. Do you want to try the plane strategy once see if it works? Yeah. Um, um, it's up to you
[20382.64s -> 20397.39s]  Yeah, let's let's try playing strat one time worth a shot. I'm loading back in here. It's definitely fun
[20398.96s -> 20400.96s]  Like not every game that comes out has to be
[20401.44s -> 20404.00s]  like a masterpiece
[20404.94s -> 20409.34s]  It's just fun to play. It's not I mean, it's just good. I guess kind of
[20411.77s -> 20414.88s]  Really pretty looking game seems to be well acted
[20416.16s -> 20419.84s]  But you kind of it would just we you're just playing the same game
[20419.84s -> 20426.72s]  You've already played just kind of more stuff to do since but since like far cry four, right?
[20427.20s -> 20433.55s]  It's sort of every far cry has been like a dlc for far cry four. Is that accurate? Yeah, pretty much
[20437.79s -> 20441.07s]  There's only so much new stuff you can add once you've got like yeah
[20441.93s -> 20443.93s]  helicopters planes
[20444.03s -> 20452.84s]  Uh jet skis boats with guns on them boats with the grenade launchers on them. You got a black screen. Yeah, it's it's loading
[20454.54s -> 20466.32s]  What is this warm up pso cash thing? I've never seen that before all right
[20466.32s -> 20480.41s]  We're gonna play try to plane strat see what happens. What was the one you you play? Uh, what far cry primal?
[20481.93s -> 20486.57s]  yeah, that was like the um, uh, that was that was the
[20487.68s -> 20493.00s]  One with the dinosaurs and the mammoths. I wonder if that one's fun. I never played it
[20493.82s -> 20503.47s]  All right. I'm ready for an invite. Okay. I'm currently connecting to the far cry servers
[20504.27s -> 20509.31s]  Please wait
[20509.31s -> 20511.87s]  How do you feel about sorb being in smash? What are your thoughts?
[20513.76s -> 20515.92s]  Uh, what are my thoughts on sora being in smash?
[20519.79s -> 20521.80s]  well
[20521.80s -> 20524.92s]  Where to begin first I need to go ahead and show you guys the prologue
[20525.00s -> 20527.00s]  This is the lore for kingdom hearts one
[20527.32s -> 20532.84s]  And i'm trying to figure out how to canonically connect the sora in smash brothers with the other 17 kingdom hearts games
[20533.08s -> 20536.20s]  So if you guys would all just uh, go ahead and sit down get a snack pay attention
[20536.20s -> 20540.36s]  We're gonna watch all the lore videos for all the kingdom hearts games back to back in order to understand
[20541.00s -> 20547.64s]  Why sakurai decided to do this and go ahead and extend the kingdom hearts lore into the smash universe thereby
[20548.43s -> 20553.85s]  Putting every single smash character potentially in the next kingdom hearts game you say can I have an invite?
[20555.50s -> 20563.44s]  Yeah, I already sent you one. Let's see. What the heck that was pretty good. Uh explainer
[20563.68s -> 20569.04s]  It says I don't have one from you. It said I don't have a I don't have one. I sent another one
[20569.52s -> 20576.16s]  got it, um,
[20576.16s -> 20578.32s]  one of the things that I heard or that I was looking at is that
[20579.20s -> 20583.42s]  Sora has been they wanted to put him in the game like a year or two ago, right?
[20583.82s -> 20584.78s]  but like
[20584.78s -> 20590.54s]  It took like three years of like lawyers all yelling at each other before they finally agreed to put him in the game or something
[20591.10s -> 20594.33s]  Because I was confused. Okay, if you're gonna have banjo kazooie
[20594.65s -> 20597.13s]  Don't you think you want banjo kazooie to be to be the last character?
[20598.20s -> 20602.12s]  And then so why wouldn't sora have come out during when kingdom hearts three was relevant?
[20602.12s -> 20604.76s]  you want to know the real reason the real reason is because
[20605.32s -> 20607.55s]  Uh, coincidentally
[20607.55s -> 20612.99s]  Sora is announced for smash at the same time that the kingdom hearts games are announced to be coming to nintendo platforms
[20613.87s -> 20617.29s]  And there it is. He's got it. There it is. You got you found the smoke and gun
[20619.29s -> 20622.89s]  It's just a brand deal like nintendo doesn't give a shit to the last character
[20622.97s -> 20626.65s]  They were just like what major uh franchise can we bring to switch because people are complaining
[20626.65s -> 20629.29s]  There's not enough third party games on our platform and they're just they're just playing
[20629.45s -> 20633.13s]  Uh pokemon snap for like 30 minutes and then putting the switch down like I don't understand
[20633.45s -> 20634.01s]  There it is
[20634.01s -> 20638.41s]  He's got to get some long ass games that will take 150 hours for gamers to complete and sell it in a big bundle
[20638.41s -> 20642.41s]  So they can buy the bundle and I guess we'll get a new character and smash at the same time. There it is
[20643.45s -> 20649.71s]  Nailing it there it is. Um
[20650.56s -> 20652.56s]  Okay, let's go to the plane joke
[20652.96s -> 20670.86s]  Where is the plane joke from here?
[20670.94s -> 20676.20s]  Uh, I was looking for the oh they're looking for the craft image. There it is. There it is
[20676.92s -> 20678.20s]  Okay, I got an idea
[20678.20s -> 20683.82s]  What if we both take a plane that way if one of us crashes the other one's alive? That's that's brilliant
[20684.38s -> 20688.44s]  I wonder if we can summon two at once which i'll say i'll have to say close
[20688.60s -> 20692.52s]  So you don't like yeah, because i'm gonna port into yours and then my plane's gonna explode
[20693.00s -> 20695.32s]  Okay, so you just drive like a few feet down the runway
[20698.70s -> 20701.07s]  Yeah, you go first
[20701.07s -> 20704.59s]  I'm just gonna be honest. I i need to follow you not the other way around
[20705.85s -> 20711.23s]  Trust me on this one. Okay. I'm just gonna set like a marker a helicopter is probably better right now
[20711.23s -> 20718.59s]  But plane but it's slow. It is slow. You're right. Okay, what happens if you call for two planes?
[20721.66s -> 20725.18s]  Just says ride cannot be delivered. Let's see if we can even spawn two planes in
[20725.98s -> 20731.26s]  Well, how about this you just go i'll try to spawn one. It's gonna teleport me into your plane anyways
[20731.90s -> 20740.51s]  So that should be fine
[20740.51s -> 20747.58s]  Vehicle currently in use so no just go so just me just you are you in if you fly?
[20747.58s -> 20754.24s]  I'll just be teleported to the backseat
[20754.56s -> 20758.80s]  Why are things exploding on the side you ran over? Oh, I got 15 trees. Oh what?
[20759.84s -> 20761.84s]  I got you with that. No, I didn't
[20762.16s -> 20768.12s]  I did not hit you with that. Did I no way
[20772.46s -> 20782.08s]  What the fuck I can't believe that hit you. Okay. Um, just fly away fly to are you
[20783.28s -> 20793.68s]  In or not? No, not yet. I'm just I can still see you now. I'm in okay
[20794.24s -> 20800.17s]  So theoretically here if you go to the ocean, maybe the right should we go fly to the ocean?
[20801.85s -> 20807.04s]  If you fly straight ahead from here, just fly straight. Oh, hang on. Oh wait
[20807.04s -> 20810.40s]  I'm looking at the wrong person here. Yeah, you gotta turn around fly towards the ocean
[20811.18s -> 20817.47s]  You will not hit any other room here. We're about to be in some very heavily restricted airspace
[20817.47s -> 20830.16s]  I'm gonna fly with this mountain. There are places where we can fly. It's just the entire zone that he's in we cannot you like your
[20831.50s -> 20834.75s]  Oh flying north
[20834.75s -> 20836.80s]  Are we upside down?
[20836.80s -> 20839.20s]  Uh to try to get out of restricted airspace
[20843.48s -> 20848.52s]  I am okay. I need to go west or what which direction I need to go. So you need to go north
[20849.92s -> 20853.31s]  fly north and
[20853.39s -> 20857.80s]  North is the restricted airspace though, is it I don't know
[20857.80s -> 20862.36s]  Okay, both of our curses are on top of each other and I can't tell who's pointing who
[20862.84s -> 20867.00s]  Okay, no turn right turn right if you pull right and just kind of i'm already committed
[20867.40s -> 20871.85s]  What are you talking about? You're already committed. I'm already in what are you doing? No, don't be in
[20872.57s -> 20874.57s]  What are you doing? Don't be in
[20877.87s -> 20886.36s]  We're going down just pressed e
[20890.59s -> 20906.03s]  What just hit you i'm still alive. All right, it didn't work. Whatever. They're you sniping at me?
[20906.67s -> 20913.79s]  Different man for himself now
[20913.79s -> 20915.79s]  I keep pushing this button
[20915.95s -> 20924.60s]  Okay, look, it's fine. We actually are
[20925.48s -> 20928.36s]  Almost halfway there. No, we're we get where I
[20932.16s -> 20939.45s]  We're almost halfway there. Hold on. I got an idea. This helicopter is just chasing me
[20940.09s -> 20944.70s]  It's okay. You're gonna come to me. I'm trying to come to you without being killed
[20945.90s -> 20947.90s]  The helicopter i'm coming
[20948.54s -> 20950.62s]  You will
[20950.62s -> 20953.82s]  Spawn me into your car. Okay, i'm coming
[20956.24s -> 20960.16s]  I don't think are you just gonna try to just drive there on the road a gta strat
[20960.24s -> 20962.80s]  We're gonna go to uh, we're gonna go to the airfield
[20963.60s -> 20965.60s]  And then steal a vehicle from the airfield
[20972.22s -> 20974.22s]  It's where it is right there
[20975.56s -> 20979.16s]  I told you we're not we're really not that far. Oh, we're really not
[20981.55s -> 20983.55s]  Like god, I hope I just throw a grenade in his room
[20984.83s -> 20986.83s]  Oh that didn't work out
[20994.75s -> 20999.74s]  Gotta go around the spikes
[20999.90s -> 21001.02s]  All right
[21001.02s -> 21005.34s]  We're in rank seven
[21005.34s -> 21009.18s]  Why do we have people behind us? Hey, it's all right. What rank are we we're gonna get like triple experience
[21009.90s -> 21014.81s]  Oh double xp weekend and far cry six pretty much what we're doing
[21016.76s -> 21019.48s]  Right click on italics his head then left click. Oh, I wonder what that does
[21020.20s -> 21030.88s]  Okay before we dive do you actually is there a plane available?
[21031.52s -> 21033.52s]  In this the senate
[21033.52s -> 21037.98s]  Um, I didn't mean to shoot. I don't know. That's very good question. You just alerted every
[21038.70s -> 21040.70s]  I alerted the pig zona
[21040.78s -> 21042.78s]  Oh
[21048.97s -> 21051.93s]  I mean if there's going to be a plane there it's this one right there
[21052.96s -> 21054.80s]  There is in fact a plane here
[21054.80s -> 21060.72s]  straight ahead
[21060.72s -> 21076.01s]  Move. Oh guard. Hang on. I can take him out. Let's go. This one has a machine gun on it. Why wasn't he dying?
[21083.28s -> 21085.28s]  Oh, there is a machine gun on this one
[21086.65s -> 21091.77s]  Okay, yup, you be I mean I did crash the last plane so I can't really talk. Hey, fly plane quick. Tell me
[21092.49s -> 21094.49s]  How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly?
[21095.29s -> 21097.29s]  How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? Okay
[21097.29s -> 21103.92s]  We have nothing else. Just head to the ocean ocean fast
[21104.96s -> 21112.95s]  We're about to get
[21113.23s -> 21116.12s]  No, sorry get a boat get a boat get a boat get a boat
[21118.40s -> 21123.96s]  I'm still alive. You are I'm alive. I have one HP. Okay. Wait say hello. I'm gonna spawn on you in a second
[21123.96s -> 21129.17s]  I'm on you. All right, we need a boat. It's right there, dude
[21129.77s -> 21137.09s]  We have to overwhelm the fuck out of somebody over here boat. Oh, we gotta go to the same boat
[21137.13s -> 21144.97s]  We have to overwhelm whoever's on it because they're gonna be people with machine guns and stuff on fire. I think so
[21146.21s -> 21148.45s]  God oh
[21149.25s -> 21158.01s]  Shit they get to the boat really hard. I will take I'm just bait right now
[21158.53s -> 21165.67s]  I have two of them three of them on me right there's more. I can't heal in here. Just stay alive
[21165.67s -> 21170.89s]  I'm gonna try to bait all of them. Okay. I'm gonna get to this boat. I just got killed. They're on you
[21170.93s -> 21181.04s]  I made it to the fiery boat. Excellent currently repairing excellent. Oh excellent
[21184.94s -> 21186.94s]  No dinner today, huh
[21191.78s -> 21205.70s]  Okay, okay repaired I'm gonna drive we gotta go guy in the water I think there is fuck him look here's
[21206.22s -> 21210.32s]  All right
[21210.32s -> 21214.40s]  Perfect. This is exactly where we were last time. We just have to get over here
[21215.36s -> 21217.36s]  Can you stop for a sec so I can get in the gunner?
[21217.52s -> 21231.18s]  All right, you go. All right. There are mines here. We have to be aware of going for that building over there here
[21231.34s -> 21233.34s]  Did they don't want us out here?
[21233.90s -> 21238.74s]  So I'm thinking once I get in here, I'm gonna take a right
[21239.30s -> 21250.40s]  Let's see. We could we could like you should be able to see him. They're like
[21251.04s -> 21253.89s]  Floating in the water. So should I bang?
[21253.89s -> 21257.69s]  Should I go right just bang it right here and just we'll go in there or should I wrap around further?
[21257.69s -> 21261.21s]  Cuz I feel like it's right there. That's his like big hideout or something, right? Yeah
[21261.21s -> 21264.61s]  Like we exploded just in front of his head towards the seawall to the right
[21265.25s -> 21270.24s]  All right. I see the mines. Oh, there you go. Yeah, the big big red bubbles
[21270.84s -> 21275.05s]  Can I shoot him? I?
[21275.05s -> 21277.09s]  Would you're alerting people to our presence?
[21277.69s -> 21280.57s]  Okay, so if we get up here
[21280.77s -> 21284.03s]  See this spot right here
[21284.27s -> 21297.33s]  Right where the wall is clear in a path. The question is do I get how far in is this place?
[21299.03s -> 21301.03s]  From where we are right now
[21301.19s -> 21304.72s]  Should we jump over here and just kind of start a sneak into the house
[21305.08s -> 21308.02s]  We're gonna have to go through the whole city
[21308.10s -> 21311.85s]  What about is there a better place of me extremely restrictive you have to fly into it
[21311.85s -> 21314.53s]  You'll be shot down to die immediately, but we're not flying it
[21315.05s -> 21318.81s]  What are we going for this building? Like I would say the big one. Yeah
[21319.33s -> 21321.95s]  Like the one with the red the red light at the top
[21321.95s -> 21331.69s]  Yeah, I feel like that's a big isn't that the hotel or is that his like actual hideout? Well, he's got we got
[21333.10s -> 21334.18s]  square
[21334.18s -> 21339.29s]  Park or a del Leon
[21339.73s -> 21349.22s]  Where the where the spoilers in chat? Well, we have to get out of here. Anyways, so let's just get out
[21350.33s -> 21356.19s]  We can't take the boat over here. It's a mansion
[21356.63s -> 21368.11s]  Okay, this is probably the good time to like actually change to usable guns poor daily own is the hideout. So we need to go
[21368.67s -> 21384.03s]  There was that okay, we have toro did alone dating on the law. Yeah, whatever. It's marked. We have to be very careful
[21384.43s -> 21408.89s]  Okay, I'm just changing load out. There's a car right here. Looks like there's nobody around that is that
[21409.77s -> 21413.19s]  Is that gonna be should we put all our eggs?
[21413.19s -> 21419.82s]  I feel like we should do not split out to be in this. Yeah, like not split up but like he separated
[21419.82s -> 21421.82s]  I said the respawn points are too valuable
[21422.42s -> 21431.27s]  Well, I'm gonna slowly just kind of start moving around void this all the all the red gas shit. That's the enemy side
[21431.71s -> 21437.98s]  Yeah, there's a lot of Emmys down there. Honestly, I would just get in the car for now because there's no enemies down
[21438.58s -> 21446.25s]  Almost away from their suspicion. There we go. Okay. Yeah, I would just get in the car right now
[21446.29s -> 21452.16s]  Until we find a new car is in the event that you could you get detected? I we can just get out of here
[21452.52s -> 21464.77s]  All right, let's do it. I'm just avoiding all the red circles dead ahead
[21469.14s -> 21471.14s]  And the houses too
[21472.81s -> 21475.97s]  Why does this feel like dying light? Oh wait for the car to pass
[21484.61s -> 21488.09s]  Just like running over shit, okay, this is we can go this way now
[21488.65s -> 21498.54s]  It's a roadblock up ahead. There is but there's nobody here. I think they're in the guard tower. Oh fuck
[21499.10s -> 21506.58s]  Are we gonna get through this? Uh, I think it's very purpose-built to not allow this
[21506.58s -> 21508.58s]  I think we're gonna have to go on foot to be honest
[21508.98s -> 21516.38s]  All right, let's sneak just put this holster your gun. Maybe it'll buy us more time. Yeah, go for stealth stab kills
[21516.90s -> 21524.62s]  Where are you going?
[21527.29s -> 21529.29s]  Restricted areas
[21530.25s -> 21532.89s]  Blue marker, no, no the the white one
[21533.77s -> 21538.83s]  Make it again
[21538.83s -> 21545.25s]  Yeah, the one I'm looking at is this one here or Deleon is where he is. Oh, it's blue for me. Okay
[21545.67s -> 21553.90s]  What is that as a stork? I feed the stork. I
[21557.94s -> 21559.94s]  Thought the stork made that noise
[21561.58s -> 21564.58s]  It's like the period just ended in like a hockey game
[21569.48s -> 21574.65s]  Pelican. All right, let's go this way. Hang on. Hang on
[21574.89s -> 21578.77s]  We have a silenced gun, but it probably does no damage to like level eight
[21578.93s -> 21582.09s]  No, the only I would only gonna be able to stealth kill these guys
[21582.85s -> 21591.02s]  It says one there's a guy scary guy there. No, that's a dog
[21591.54s -> 21602.94s]  It's a dog and a scary guy about this way an idea. That's a slow take it easy
[21603.46s -> 21605.58s]  We're not in a rush
[21605.58s -> 21618.41s]  Yeah, we if we are literally dead on site now
[21618.71s -> 21624.96s]  This is actually this gameplay right here is is kind of what Deathloop is sort of
[21626.46s -> 21628.38s]  Oh
[21628.38s -> 21630.38s]  Alright
[21630.54s -> 21635.77s]  Nobody's here. Are we good? Can we yeah. Yeah, we're good. Does it hurt? Oh
[21640.46s -> 21656.23s]  There's a crafting table here, I think those are good guys on the right are they a new fast travel open location. Oh
[21657.88s -> 21664.52s]  Dude, oh dude. There's no way the dude is here. Oh, he's here. Oh, he wasn't my voice to hear that
[21664.52s -> 21677.05s]  I want to be able to shoot him in the head once and kill him
[21680.69s -> 21687.42s]  That's definitely not gonna happen. I want sir slightly reduced
[21688.06s -> 21690.40s]  weapon noise
[21690.40s -> 21701.39s]  No, that's it. That's getting rid of no. No, I don't want range. I don't want to do that. Maybe I do
[21704.10s -> 21712.30s]  Optical socket. Okay, I want I haven't unlocked any others armor piercing. I've got a I've got a decent weapon with a silencer now
[21712.30s -> 21733.21s]  I do armor piercing without no I can't it's locked item missing. All right, what are the weapons? Can we do here?
[21733.53s -> 21741.84s]  Sniper I mean there's also the theory that mean if we can just run on his front door and just hold the fucking fire
[21741.84s -> 21744.84s]  Dang down. They just don't just wm1 pyro his house
[21745.40s -> 21748.86s]  It's possible. Yeah, you could do you could go
[21749.50s -> 21754.30s]  Flamethrower just if you're gonna do flamethrower put the like fire gloves on see don't burn yourself
[21754.30s -> 21764.47s]  I'm gonna put flamethrower on I'm gonna put this new
[21766.79s -> 21772.69s]  How do you unlock new utility like throwables cuz there's like grenades and stuff that's a great question
[21773.21s -> 21792.22s]  Okay, I've got level three Captain America shield what you're seeing is democracy
[21792.84s -> 21799.22s]  Absolute. Oh, that's a good headlock there, sir. You know your judo. Well
[21799.92s -> 21803.75s]  Get your hand off of my penis
[21807.49s -> 21808.49s]  classic
[21808.49s -> 21813.56s]  Okay, they're they're on this road
[21814.16s -> 21819.22s]  His voice is getting louder
[21819.54s -> 21822.49s]  He's on the mic right now. Yes
[21823.23s -> 21829.15s]  Okay, what about if we go down this alley this way over here?
[21832.86s -> 21838.02s]  What is the charm a meal a succulent Chinese meal
[21840.98s -> 21851.28s]  Ta-ta and farewell you can use the grapple to on
[21851.84s -> 21856.56s]  Is there is there a grapple point? I mean it probably is. Oh, there is a grapple point
[21857.12s -> 21860.34s]  Can't see it from here
[21860.34s -> 21862.22s]  Damn it. I keep thinking that
[21862.22s -> 21865.86s]  Like they've seen us. Yeah, that's like a you've been spotted
[21866.02s -> 21879.60s]  Why why be careful be careful be careful why oh, it's to the grapple from below, okay?
[21882.08s -> 21888.17s]  It's fine, there's nobody down here. All right, well, there's like a perfectly cut scream clip possibly
[21892.41s -> 21896.67s]  Right, there's the child there's people to the left here
[21897.95s -> 21904.42s]  I'm thinking down this yeah down this alleyway
[21908.10s -> 21910.10s]  What happened what happened to you all right?
[21915.88s -> 21927.64s]  All right, we're gonna make it through here. I thought there was a guy's head and closer all right easy

[21934.54s -> 21944.28s]  Where do we go this way? Oh shit? Oh wait. We just got so laying people out
[21944.28s -> 21949.46s]  I think I think we that's probably a better way to go though. Don't you think?
[21949.46s -> 21951.46s]  That person is an RPG
[21953.66s -> 21960.77s]  Which can run to his house run to his house they do have an RPG
[21961.49s -> 21968.71s]  Holy shit, he's in the face of the RPG. Oh

[21979.46s -> 21990.60s]  All right, I got mine taken care of there's like three this down that hallway straight in front of you down that alleyway
[21990.60s -> 21992.36s]  There's two people with rocket launchers
[21992.36s -> 22005.41s]  Alright, I'm gonna avoid them and my heel back. I don't think they could possibly know where I am
[22005.41s -> 22013.55s]  I wonder can I get the rocket launcher from that guy if I kill him? I wonder if I can get him
[22013.91s -> 22025.50s]  You shooting yep. Oh you need help. Here's it. Oh my god
[22029.94s -> 22033.56s]  I'm sorry dog. I'm so sorry I

[22047.82s -> 22052.51s]  We've got to shoot in the head that's very important watch out guys. I don't know what that guy
[22053.19s -> 22065.66s]  All right helicopter. We gotta like hide from the chopper. Where's it? Oh shit. Oh more guards. Really? Yep
[22065.66s -> 22072.89s]  I'm gonna retreat back turn back dead. Oh the chopper is what scares me
[22073.85s -> 22082.40s]  Check watch it. Watch it dead. Is he dead? All right, let's go
[22087.39s -> 22089.39s]  oceans minus two oh
[22093.86s -> 22095.86s]  Shit, we're getting close man. Uh
[22096.75s -> 22100.07s]  We are getting close what's gonna happen when we get there, I don't know
[22100.71s -> 22102.71s]  I'm gonna run over the flame throw and hold it down
[22103.19s -> 22118.31s]  As long as look just me and you are the last people there's two other people that are left in pub G
[22118.31s -> 22125.45s]  It's you and me just play like your life depends on it. Okay, they're across the street someone someone's over there that can see us
[22125.93s -> 22127.93s]  Okay, let me I can I snipe them
[22128.45s -> 22131.13s]  Very important playing pub GPC or mobile
[22132.85s -> 22134.97s]  Yeah, there's a guy right there I think I can get him
[22137.61s -> 22141.32s]  Dead roof. I shot him in the head
[22141.72s -> 22155.13s]  Keep it. Um, there's a lot of people on this street. All right, just left for dead time left left for dead
[22155.93s -> 22176.21s]  Bathroom until they leave us long. This guy just ziplined. I guess not. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck
[22176.57s -> 22188.78s]  Why not hitting this guy?
[22188.98s -> 22200.43s]  I'm gonna stealth kill the mortar guy
[22203.98s -> 22211.23s]  Wow, I can't help you I have zero health this one guy down here
[22212.89s -> 22219.61s]  All right, you just stay alive because I have zero HP. Okay, I'm healing. I don't know who can see me
[22220.15s -> 22228.85s]  Somebody can see me. All right. I got I got my health back my heel back. See if I can pop this guy
[22228.85s -> 22232.73s]  I have no bullets in this gun. What am I? What the hell are you doing? Jeremy? Oh
[22236.19s -> 22238.19s]  Shit, we need ammo
[22238.57s -> 22244.71s]  He's focusing on you
[22246.75s -> 22253.54s]  I'm alive down here. If you need to die, go for it. All right. All right. I'm gonna come and cover. I'm sorry doggy
[22253.94s -> 22265.95s]  I'm sorry. I have to get ammo. I guess I'm like a pistol ammo. You should give me a break
[22266.51s -> 22277.91s]  Hey, I think we have to run. This is totally walled off over here. Is this
[22278.67s -> 22281.68s]  Shit, what about down this way? Oh
[22284.26s -> 22297.47s]  I'm down that hurt. I'm just gonna die so I can spawn on top with you. Okay, just stay in a safe place
[22297.47s -> 22312.75s]  I feel pretty safe here. I gotta switch weapons about to spawn on you in like 10 seconds
[22313.03s -> 22325.43s]  Okay rank up to stand up to stronger soldiers. That's fine. I'm coming on you. Here we are
[22325.43s -> 22331.87s]  I need to change weapons. Don't stand up by the way, if you stand on the guy
[22332.63s -> 22338.92s]  To the north he made they may have seen but I don't know if they can get up here
[22343.02s -> 22346.08s]  Somebody can see us when we stand. Yeah
[22346.60s -> 22357.31s]  That 352 this way. All right, we just gonna keep going this way. Yeah, but that that way's a super wall
[22357.31s -> 22362.53s]  Is it super walls completely? What if we go to the light might be able to parachute over it? You think so?
[22363.17s -> 22365.05s]  Like getting on top of this
[22365.05s -> 22369.41s]  There's a bad place for yeah, we definitely gonna get over there from here on the roof. We gotta move
[22369.41s -> 22371.05s]  We gotta move. We gotta move. Gotta move
[22371.05s -> 22378.71s]  Fuck the parachute didn't go off. Don't jump. Don't don't wait. What do we both die?
[22380.35s -> 22389.88s]  It wasn't high enough to deploy the parachute. Oh, come on
[22396.23s -> 22401.71s]  That was a classic fall joke. Oh, all right now that we got a fast travel point though, didn't we?
[22401.71s -> 22402.99s]  Let's see if it works
[22402.99s -> 22418.01s]  It it yeah, apparently I can't believe we both didn't get the parachutes up
[22418.01s -> 22424.45s]  I think it was just too hot too high, but too low too high to live too low to parachute
[22426.05s -> 22434.70s]  All right, let's go I didn't even see Teresa the entire time somebody said you might be able to wing suit
[22435.34s -> 22439.94s]  We have to go to like a real well, I might be able to and then pull you pull you in
[22439.94s -> 22442.18s]  Yeah, dude, what if we just okay, hold on hear me out here
[22442.78s -> 22446.64s]  Let's go all the way up to the top of this building and then you just wing suit and fly over there
[22446.96s -> 22453.10s]  Everybody sees us here
[22456.83s -> 22470.73s]  Okay, I can't hurt these guys at all. We need armor piercing bolts. Oh shit. Oh, I have soft ammo on
[22476.22s -> 22490.68s]  Soft ammo I need the other gun, but I can't I don't have time to switch to it. Oh, that was you shit
[22491.28s -> 22495.58s]  That was me. I can't even
[22497.26s -> 22499.26s]  Know
[22500.54s -> 22502.54s]  Bird motherfucker, how dare you
[22504.06s -> 22507.01s]  Oh
[22514.09s -> 22528.46s]  Okay, I need let me do hold on let me change my ammo dude if it is a bench this thing sucks
[22528.78s -> 22534.86s]  Me like give me this thing and I won't change the ammo on it
[22537.61s -> 22544.32s]  Armor piercings on it. That's good. I gotta put armor piercing on this thing, too
[22544.80s -> 22556.77s]  It's no ammo on this thing. I think you unlock more at the workbench. Is that you?
[22557.57s -> 22566.76s]  What this is I'm at the workbench. Oh, there we go. There's a guy. Okay, just put armor piercing on every gun
[22567.12s -> 22577.64s]  Yeah, you don't have to be the workman's you can do it anyway. Yeah, you can do it anywhere. Okay
[22578.24s -> 22595.60s]  One mod available to install it workbench. Oh, come on. Okay. Here we go. You put armor piercing on your flamethrower
[22596.32s -> 22597.60s]  I
[22597.60s -> 22601.52s]  Can't switch it out. I don't think I have it. Yeah, you have to be at a workbench
[22605.37s -> 22606.57s]  Oh
[22606.57s -> 22608.57s]  What the fuck why?
[22608.81s -> 22611.31s]  All right. So hey look
[22611.71s -> 22618.90s]  See that grapple point over there. We need to get on top of this building. That's high enough for you to wingsuit across the town
[22619.42s -> 22624.41s]  Uh-huh, but you can't die though. Like is there a way can you safely land the wingsuit somehow?
[22625.29s -> 22627.09s]  parachute
[22627.09s -> 22641.40s]  We have to get we have to get higher. Yeah, we actually do need to get higher. Hold on. I got an idea
[22641.80s -> 22654.36s]  There's a workbench right there. Yeah, I know it's too late though. Are you gonna try to like worms?
[22655.08s -> 22657.08s]  Ninja rope up to another platform
[22657.76s -> 22664.87s]  Yeah, but I can't I can't like any more anymore slack. You're gonna hit the wall
[22666.37s -> 22673.99s]  Slow it down. I see you're gonna try to go up here
[22677.60s -> 22681.54s]  You actually might be able to do this if you can grab on top of where that moss is
[22681.98s -> 22690.32s]  This is difficult and it's not going anywhere
[22691.00s -> 22692.80s]  Any more space
[22692.80s -> 22709.10s]  Okay, except this person throwing grenades up here. We got to get across to it. Let's go across three
[22709.70s -> 22720.34s]  Okay, you first tell us you don't have parachutes. That's why that's what's going on. We don't have parachutes. It's grayed out
[22720.70s -> 22725.74s]  It's not that we're not deploying them fast enough where it's too low or too high. We don't have them
[22726.30s -> 22743.87s]  Maybe I don't have a wingsuit either. Okay, so there's another tall building. Yep that we can climb
[22744.47s -> 22752.53s]  You you lead you're the one that has the suit. Hopefully you still have it. Do I have the suit?
[22753.33s -> 22760.16s]  Find out. Oh
[22760.16s -> 22762.24s]  Back turn around. No
[22762.24s -> 22763.59s]  Add
[22763.59s -> 22765.59s]  Wait, are you alive? Yeah. Oh, yeah
[22765.59s -> 22774.06s]  Who's this then except my dog all the way back there? I think so
[22774.74s -> 22780.48s]  Yeah, there's like there's like four or five guards on the street. Okay
[22785.99s -> 22795.51s]  Hmm. All right. I see. Yep. We gotta take these guys out
[22796.43s -> 22799.88s]  All right, you stay up there then
[22800.28s -> 22813.59s]  That guy's got a lot of armor. Do you think a human body can block a rocket behind you behind you behind you behind you?
[22814.15s -> 22819.25s]  Why are you behind you behind you? I'm trying to shoot him. I'm
[22821.69s -> 22823.69s]  Okay, is that it I
[22827.12s -> 22829.64s]  Think that's it on this street helicopter coming in
[22833.10s -> 22838.35s]  Chopper is here. Oh
[22838.47s -> 22846.72s]  We got impacts wax. I feel like this is probably good. There's like high-level gear. Where are you over here?
[22847.08s -> 22848.00s]  in the building
[22848.00s -> 22869.06s]  Helicopters here now tension coming this way. Yeah, there is. All right. What if we go? I'm really sorry. I'm sorry
[22869.06s -> 22871.06s]  We have we need clear road
[22873.57s -> 22875.83s]  Does the chopper know where we are? I don't know
[22876.57s -> 22883.80s]  Probably. Okay, so I'm just gonna go for this alley dead ahead. Um, is this person on the ladder? Oh
[22884.32s -> 22888.73s]  It's not that person off the ladder
[22896.91s -> 22907.48s]  They're freaking out down there. All right, we have to move. Oh shit. Yeah, we're gonna move. Where are we going from here?
[22909.96s -> 22914.90s]  I need to get to the top of a really tall building to see if I can ring suit
[22915.34s -> 22937.73s]  There's too many fucking people there. This is the street from last time. Is that a friendly dog? Oh, thank God
[22938.21s -> 22940.45s]  Okay, so we know how this ends
[22940.73s -> 22947.07s]  The chopper is just chasing me, but I'm behind you
[22947.59s -> 22953.86s]  He the chopper is gonna be overhead in a second. It's here. Oh
[22960.35s -> 22972.06s]  What happened that hurt?
[22972.38s -> 22978.86s]  Sucks, what about that alley straight ahead to your right? Oh
[22980.60s -> 22982.60s]  Fuck bad. Very bad
[22983.36s -> 22999.56s]  Hiding I'm just hiding that somehow. I am technically still alive. I'm gonna reload guns
[23000.08s -> 23012.36s]  Who sees me who sees me who sees me who sees me who sees me?
[23019.92s -> 23025.66s]  Just hang over there I'll hang over here. I can't hang over. I can't hang over there anymore. I got an idea
[23026.18s -> 23031.66s]  I'm almost I'm out of ammo for a lot of whips. Oh
[23034.02s -> 23036.20s]  This is bad. Okay. I'm gonna go for something here
[23042.06s -> 23062.55s]  Okay, fixing my broken ow, I kind of went around to the right side
[23062.55s -> 23064.47s]  I'm gonna see if there's anything over here we can do
[23064.47s -> 23067.74s]  Have they sounded the alarm already? I
[23068.38s -> 23072.14s]  Think so like on the roof
[23072.78s -> 23081.16s]  Damn it. They really don't want you to go over there. Yeah
[23081.76s -> 23092.44s]  Like e1 is super off-limits manhole manhole. There's a manhole
[23092.88s -> 23102.34s]  Where is it dude come to me? Holy shit. This is the way in
[23104.35s -> 23111.98s]  Actually the way in where are you? I would just throw yourself off a building. I have no idea how I got here
[23112.22s -> 23115.94s]  There is no wingsuit. Yeah, no wingsuit
[23116.46s -> 23136.80s]  Not permitted at this location. All right, I'm dead. So don't die. It's gonna hide. I gotta switch guns to these armor
[23138.14s -> 23150.70s]  25% damn it. What does he like the metal gear solid death sound?
[23151.06s -> 23155.43s]  I'm here. Okay, take a look at this
[23157.38s -> 23159.81s]  interesting, huh, oh
[23160.17s -> 23162.37s]  God don't do what I did. Don't do what I did. Don't do what I did
[23163.41s -> 23177.13s]  Nice and slow. Oh, we got flash game flashlights and everything. Isn't this the tutorial sewer?
[23177.97s -> 23179.13s]  Yeah
[23179.13s -> 23182.79s]  There are alligators down here. You're gonna turn into one
[23183.31s -> 23190.13s]  They've hostile. Let's not find out
[23193.37s -> 23207.40s]  Are we gonna like a pop-up in his bathroom like in his toilet? There's a I mean at that
[23207.74s -> 23214.77s]  We could but we would just be copying. All right. I'm not gonna go out yet because George are Martin
[23214.93s -> 23219.53s]  You might put your head out and die. Is it safe? There's a tank out here. Okay
[23219.53s -> 23222.37s]  There's a hang on if we stay safe crouched completely hidden
[23222.85s -> 23228.13s]  There's a chance we might if they're not in the tank already. We might be able to get the tank. Oh
[23228.77s -> 23235.10s]  Bro, okay. That sounds like a great idea ready. I don't have a silencer
[23235.10s -> 23238.86s]  There's a guy right to your left right to your left literally right next to us. You'll see that
[23239.42s -> 23241.99s]  Okay, I'm taking a shot. What about the guy right here?
[23247.50s -> 23250.83s]  Take care of the alarm. I will shoot the alarm
[23253.37s -> 23254.82s]  Did you get it?
[23254.82s -> 23259.90s]  No, he got it. Oh, yes. Oh, no, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
[23259.90s -> 23262.14s]  I don't know what to do. I'm freezing in panic. I'm gonna go this way
[23262.74s -> 23266.54s]  I'm gonna go. I don't know what to do. Where do I go? I'm gonna go this way. I think I'm running over here. Oh
[23269.30s -> 23276.04s]  Just run just run just run just run run run run run back in the sewer. Hey, can you get back?
[23276.74s -> 23278.74s]  Oh
[23280.58s -> 23284.49s]  He went into the tank
[23284.89s -> 23288.57s]  Yeah, like he okay. It's like his animation started
[23289.33s -> 23292.29s]  Or I could like shoot him to get out of it. Damn it. Oh
[23298.08s -> 23301.92s]  He wouldn't he just started speeding I freaked I don't know where to go
[23301.92s -> 23305.40s]  I didn't know if I was gonna run into a bunch of enemies. All right, last try one more try. Let's go for it
[23305.40s -> 23310.28s]  Hey last try. Let's try. Let's try going different route. I'm gonna put armor piercing on every single weapon you have
[23314.17s -> 23326.24s]  Let's try taking a different path. I don't know that for sure that if I was allowed to take the tank
[23326.24s -> 23331.66s]  I there was no prompt. Yeah, can you how do you craft ammo? Can you craft ammo?
[23332.80s -> 23335.42s]  some guns you
[23335.54s -> 23341.15s]  Pick like primary weapon, whatever then the gun. It should be the first attachment mod
[23341.15s -> 23348.60s]  I really don't have enough to do armor piercing for um, it's annoying
[23348.88s -> 23359.74s]  You have to EMP a tank to steal it. You actually can have an EMP really to disable vehicles
[23359.98s -> 23366.06s]  But I don't know how to get it now you up you change your backpack. Oh, they're here. What do you mean?
[23366.06s -> 23376.31s]  They're here stun grenade smoke grenades
[23376.99s -> 23385.10s]  Dynamite I don't have we don't have EMPs. I don't think there's a perception grenade. I don't know what that is
[23388.00s -> 23396.74s]  EMP sticky EMP grenade blast grenade EMP acquire Supremo from Juan's office or his arms dealers

[23510.09s -> 23513.55s]  They were all just about to collapse on us
[23515.44s -> 23517.78s]  Luckily, I put armor piercing rounds on my

[24138.68s -> 24140.54s]  Okay
[24140.54s -> 24144.78s]  We're good. Somebody said go right in the sewer and it gets to the compound
[24144.78s -> 24148.60s]  I was like 80 meters away from whatever the objective was
[24149.44s -> 24150.52s]  Really?
[24150.52s -> 24152.76s]  But I may have set the objective marker way too close
[24154.16s -> 24157.88s]  There you are, okay
[24163.08s -> 24165.60s]  I'm running out of ammo, but I'm here. Yeah me too

[24188.73s -> 24190.73s]  This person alive
[24195.84s -> 24197.48s]  They're dead now
[24197.48s -> 24204.39s]  Okay, guapos back combat's over. Actually is it okay? Are you gonna go?
[24204.39s -> 24209.54s]  We get a clean clean slate. Are you just gonna check and see if you can just walk into the compound?
[24209.66s -> 24212.10s]  I'm just gonna go back. Remember that we ran to the um
[24212.78s -> 24217.97s]  The tank yeah, I feel like that's kind of where we're going right think so
[24218.61s -> 24222.44s]  Wait, did we come from this way or are we going?
[24223.12s -> 24225.66s]  We are going kind of that way
[24243.36s -> 24247.26s]  Hang on are you back there? How'd you go? I'm in the sewer man. I'm not leaving the sewer
[24247.84s -> 24250.80s]  I'm like on the street level
[24250.80s -> 24261.04s]  You're gonna have to catch up to me though, right? I mean should I just go from the city you can go this way
[24261.62s -> 24264.96s]  You can go up to me at least you want to come up to you
[24264.96s -> 24268.68s]  Are you sure you won't I sure I'm gonna cuz we're gonna get we're gonna I could I could just keep going until
[24268.68s -> 24271.00s]  I teleport you I guess that's true. I
[24274.06s -> 24275.78s]  We certain that you'll be able to
[24275.78s -> 24281.24s]  That means people saying stay in the sewer people saying so we're sewer sewer you have to do the sewer sewer is the only
[24281.24s -> 24291.28s]  Way apparently people saying sewer is the only way. Oh, okay. Well, then maybe I'm just going in a circle then
[24295.51s -> 24298.67s]  Or maybe chat just really wants you to stay in a sewer just to see how long you'll do it
[24298.71s -> 24308.28s]  That's fine. You go you got to tank through the sewer stay in the sewer
[24317.49s -> 24325.07s]  What are you doing down here? There's somebody down here. Okay, I'm gonna die so I can respawn on you in the sewer
[24325.07s -> 24351.73s]  Yeah, who killed Guapo? What am I doing down here? He was the protagonist of a different story. You better not die
[24351.73s -> 24355.15s]  Don't do anything stupid. I am standing still. I'm not going anywhere
[24355.79s -> 24371.46s]  Don't get surprised by a crocodile. I won't there's no crocodiles down here. There's a pretty good side character POV
[24371.86s -> 24383.65s]  That's fine. I just want to make sure we are we are alive. Okay, here we go. I'm here
[24383.65s -> 24387.78s]  All right, so people are saying to go straight and then go right
[24388.18s -> 24403.93s]  You say that we got we got bad guys in the rear. I think we can outpace them. They'll go, right?
[24403.93s -> 24405.93s]  So I'm assuming this means right
[24406.61s -> 24414.16s]  How do we die down here the first time?
[24416.44s -> 24418.24s]  Jump or something
[24418.24s -> 24420.98s]  This goes out of the sewer. I'm I'm staying here
[24421.58s -> 24428.79s]  This is a tank again, yeah, this is other way wrong way other way other way apparently it's the other side
[24429.31s -> 24440.55s]  Yeah, we're on I'm on the wrong side here. He said there were people down here, right? Yep. They're right here
[24440.83s -> 24458.30s]  They said hug, right? It's crocodiles here now, too. I guess still shooting me and you were right in front of him
[24458.58s -> 24461.38s]  Yeah, I have a shield. Would you shoot the shield guy?
[24461.98s -> 24465.78s]  so left
[24465.78s -> 24468.28s]  instead of right I
[24468.40s -> 24471.00s]  Guess it's a secret. It's just a secret back here
[24471.72s -> 24474.28s]  It's wrong secret helmet
[24474.32s -> 24489.24s]  We have to go here. We have to get here. Okay. Well, well, I guess we've just go through where the tank is
[24489.68s -> 24496.31s]  Yeah, what the heck? Well, you guys are helping us
[24496.89s -> 24505.98s]  The shotgun is like god-tier powerful the pistol shotgun shield combo
[24506.64s -> 24511.77s]  Okay. Well, we're gonna try watch over the dog this dog right next to you
[24512.57s -> 24525.96s]  And a mean one it is. Yeah, why is he not attacking you? How safe is it if I come up?
[24527.92s -> 24544.26s]  20% he knows they like kind of know I'm here. Yeah, they know I'm here now. Sorry dog. Okay, you
[24545.02s -> 24551.21s]  Walk was down. I'm going for tank. All right, you'd go for tank. Do you want me to help suppressing fire?
[24551.93s -> 24557.66s]  I'm in you're in the tank. I'm in the tank. Oh hell. Yeah. All right
[24558.30s -> 24570.56s]  But they have RPGs and shit. This is gonna be a short-lived adventure. Do you think so?
[24574.12s -> 24577.92s]  Both I don't think you should get in on the mounted turret. That's for sure
[24583.74s -> 24590.85s]  I'm just gonna try moving but we need to go like that way kind of like right. Can we go right from here?
[24591.61s -> 24596.73s]  Can you repair me if you come back down if you come this way? Yeah, I don't want to go too far out
[24596.73s -> 24598.73s]  Hang on. Hang on. I'm just gonna hop out and try to repair
[24598.77s -> 24614.38s]  Where is this person that keeps seeing me? I don't know where they are. You're right there. Okay full help
[24615.02s -> 24619.06s]  Like I just tried to shoot a rocket on me at me. I think he's still looking at me
[24619.66s -> 24625.71s]  Press V. No, I know what V does
[24626.95s -> 24635.87s]  I don't want to do it right now. I don't I can't get in your tank though. You can but then we'll just both die
[24635.87s -> 24644.02s]  That's true. There is there there is a gunner seat though. I don't know who keeps seeing me. There's somebody right across the way
[24647.79s -> 24650.22s]  I don't like I'm on fire
[24650.46s -> 24657.34s]  Alright, what about can we go down that can that road that's right next to you? Can you go down that this really doesn't take that much?
[24657.34s -> 24674.58s]  Oh shit, I shouldn't have gotten out. Did you pop up? Yeah fight or run. What the fuck?
[24674.62s -> 24678.56s]  I think special forces are about to arrive
[24681.08s -> 24682.24s]  Wanted
[24682.24s -> 24689.24s]  We have to move. I'm moving if we go down. Can we go right? Can we go down this way?
[24689.96s -> 24695.43s]  I'm stuck. I wonder this way we can go
[24695.99s -> 24705.36s]  Back in the sewer because this is blocked off. We have to go left
[24705.36s -> 24707.80s]  But we can't we have to go eventually we are we supposed to go that way
[24708.32s -> 24726.92s]  So we're chat. How do they keep getting up like on the roof?
[24727.50s -> 24730.98s]  Alright, there's a space. There's a place we can go down here. It's a little alleyway
[24740.94s -> 24757.37s]  Okay, is there anywhere? I don't think we can go anywhere. I can't this thing doesn't turn like a tank should follow the blue line
[24757.37s -> 24762.05s]  Yeah, I'm trying to see where it even we go. We have to go that way, but
[24762.69s -> 24765.33s]  What if we jumped on your tank to jump over the wall?
[24765.89s -> 24769.16s]  that work
[24769.16s -> 24772.10s]  Watch out. I'm trying to repair you
[24772.62s -> 24789.50s]  Looking good. Oh, why are you going to circle because everything's blocked off
[24789.50s -> 24792.10s]  We're trying to find a place that we can like get over one of the walls
[24792.98s -> 24804.29s]  Somebody behind us. I only see guapo and my poor pup is just lying on the ground riding
[24804.81s -> 24807.77s]  We can't go this way kill my dog
[24808.49s -> 24810.66s]  Like how do we?
[24810.82s -> 24820.50s]  Maybe through here. I can't shoot
[24821.02s -> 24831.44s]  All right, Guapo. Help me out. Is there a grapple?
[24832.12s -> 24840.38s]  It's a grapple up here
[24840.38s -> 24841.62s]  Chirijo
[24841.62s -> 24846.82s]  You know Jeremy, maybe the area isn't available to you actually reach the point in this story
[24847.98s -> 24851.93s]  What is up here? Is that an explosive?
[24856.45s -> 24869.29s]  I guess not. What is it? It's like a beacon on top of this place. Oh shit crackle and pop machine gun
[24870.57s -> 24878.24s]  LMG what happened by machine gun might actually be good here. I just may be very good
[24878.98s -> 24880.66s]  um oh
[24880.66s -> 24887.46s]  This is where we tried to jump over. Hey, can you come to me? Oh, you're really far away
[24887.98s -> 24894.10s]  It's no grapple hook all clear
[24894.62s -> 24903.43s]  Where is it? I have a door stuck situation. You've got a door stuck scenario. Yeah
[24903.91s -> 24910.58s]  Oh, I might actually be stuck here. I feel like I can make it
[24911.18s -> 24923.46s]  Fight or run there now. Yeah, we know that I'm coming back to you. Oh
[24923.98s -> 24928.01s]  You're very far away
[24928.01s -> 24931.97s]  Cuz I'm kind of just going in a circle cuz we don't know how to get into the center cuz I don't know
[24931.97s -> 24940.77s]  I don't think we can get in there's one way. There's still one way. What is it if I can actually okay?
[24940.77s -> 24946.97s]  I wonder if you start wingsuiting from just outside of the city limits if it'll kill your wingsuit when you get in
[24949.53s -> 24955.47s]  Probably you can but this I think the sewer is south of the tower area. Oh
[24958.67s -> 24965.39s]  Dude we've been in the wrong place the whole time we need to wait we need to be like here
[24965.83s -> 24977.46s]  We've been running around in the sewers up here. We need to be down here. Let's see these blue tunnels
[24981.54s -> 24982.62s]  shit
[24982.62s -> 24989.66s]  Yeah, I'm just heading towards the new marker
[24998.98s -> 25001.60s]  Finger so
[25002.36s -> 25004.20s]  How have we
[25004.20s -> 25007.20s]  If you look at the map, we've just been really far northwest
[25007.20s -> 25012.84s]  We we're supposed to be down south of that area to see the blue lines. I think that's the sewers
[25013.40s -> 25018.69s]  We were getting like sewer directions for the wrong sewers
[25019.31s -> 25021.89s]  Yeah
[25021.89s -> 25029.04s]  Whatever. It's okay. I have a car or we'll have a car
[25030.04s -> 25033.30s]  Teresa those guys
[25034.14s -> 25038.70s]  Oh
[25038.70s -> 25051.84s]  Why did they all run towards it? Yeah. Thank you chopper chopper gameplay
[25052.36s -> 25059.58s]  Hold on gotta get closer
[25064.15s -> 25068.07s]  Nice
[25068.07s -> 25069.94s]  What a shot
[25069.94s -> 25082.36s]  Almost there. Okay. Oh
[25087.00s -> 25101.86s]  I was this car still here. This thing's insane. By the way, what this car?
[25102.46s -> 25104.46s]  Now the car that I
[25104.82s -> 25119.44s]  Alright get us to that sewer. We gotta find the manhole that's down here. I think this guy knows it
[25124.22s -> 25128.50s]  I'm going to your marker. I know go to that one. That's where we have to go
[25129.14s -> 25133.62s]  He knows we're doing this. Yeah, we should get out
[25134.10s -> 25145.82s]  What is right here? There's a sewer right here. This is the sewer that we need to get it to get into the compound
[25146.22s -> 25151.58s]  This is the secret sewer we got the all clear
[25152.18s -> 25171.67s]  Don't do what I did. That kills you. Be very careful. Good fault joke. All right, so now we have to just go from here
[25172.23s -> 25176.68s]  This sure ways
[25176.68s -> 25180.92s]  We gotta go we gotta go left. Yeah, go left. This will take us through
[25181.80s -> 25189.20s]  Yep, this way. I don't know about this
[25189.84s -> 25199.39s]  Sewer looks awfully similar thing on this. It's just free stuff. Oh, I get it all even if you if I don't pick it up
[25199.75s -> 25203.65s]  Yeah, we're about to be in his compound
[25211.73s -> 25216.46s]  This is the do or die right here. It's either we do it or we don't so
[25217.16s -> 25224.97s]  We're in like another just kind of tell now he did straight ahead that building is his tower
[25232.51s -> 25237.63s]  There any people think these are civilians. Yeah, we just holster. No, we're not supposed to be here
[25237.63s -> 25249.57s]  We're gonna kill on site the sleepy alien people are just standing outside yawning your front door
[25249.67s -> 25253.12s]  This is like it is like in the movie when the bad guy
[25254.08s -> 25257.40s]  Tricks the good guy into thinking it was easy to get to this point
[25257.40s -> 25262.98s]  You know and then like the lights come on and they were expecting them to break in the entire time
[25263.14s -> 25293.91s]  Yeah, I don't can we go in here. This looks totally blocked. Yes. Okay. Okay, we're in. All right
[25293.91s -> 25295.91s]  We're in we're in that guy was
[25296.79s -> 25298.79s]  Extremely surprised. All right
[25299.27s -> 25303.47s]  No panicking. No panicking. We're gonna get through this. We're gonna go up all the way up the stairs
[25303.95s -> 25307.73s]  We need to play this together cover each other
[25312.18s -> 25315.89s]  There's no guards yet, okay
[25317.37s -> 25323.21s]  New shotgun wait, hold on. Let me look let me equip that cover me cover you we got where are you?
[25323.21s -> 25330.88s]  Oh, there you are. We had dogs in coming. I'm getting a shotgun equipped. Okay shotguns equipped
[25331.40s -> 25346.22s]  Nice and easy. Can you go that way? No
[25353.64s -> 25357.20s]  Hopefully there's this anyway to go. Can we not go anyway?
[25357.88s -> 25362.50s]  Cuz I'm looking at the enemy dog that's trying to get us in it. They're just like pathing around. I
[25363.02s -> 25365.63s]  would assume
[25365.63s -> 25375.51s]  He's not open. There's a I see a grapple point, but it's like kind of outside
[25376.23s -> 25378.23s]  We can't go up
[25379.27s -> 25382.34s]  Here somebody's Oh
[25384.30s -> 25389.75s]  Grapple on roof in big room shit
[25395.37s -> 25402.82s]  Hmm like I see that I see that too is that maybe that's outside
[25408.44s -> 25412.32s]  Definitely not available from here. Oh my god
[25413.80s -> 25420.01s]  Come on here
[25420.01s -> 25431.58s]  The grapple looks like it was on this side. It was definitely like inside but also
[25432.50s -> 25434.67s]  Not on the first floor
[25434.67s -> 25437.72s]  Yeah, it's like it's like right there shit
[25440.87s -> 25447.49s]  They've protected it. I don't think we can get in there an impenetrable locked door
[25448.21s -> 25459.14s]  Damnit, we can't get up there. I don't think um
[25459.62s -> 25467.88s]  I don't think you can fly anything here. No, you know, it's probably it's probably like it loads the area. Probably
[25468.56s -> 25475.26s]  It's probably story locked
[25478.26s -> 25482.86s]  Dogs like attacking me while I'm like smoking a cigar. I'm sorry dog, but I'm gonna die
[25482.86s -> 25490.77s]  I don't think there's any other place we can go. Hi. Is there is there a helicopter around here?
[25490.77s -> 25497.70s]  I mean we could look if there is I don't know where it would be
[25498.34s -> 25508.01s]  Wait, that's a good dog. Oh
[25509.21s -> 25517.87s]  I think the dog barking at us and attacking. That's not a good dog
[25518.47s -> 25530.50s]  You can't slight tackle them. They're running into the building. Um, I don't I don't think there's a I don't think I think I think
[25530.50s -> 25531.90s]  We're screwed. I
[25531.90s -> 25533.86s]  Think we're probably screwed too
[25533.86s -> 25540.79s]  Hang out wait for him to leave and go to a restaurant or something
[25542.43s -> 25546.39s]  But I cleared the street
[25546.39s -> 25552.72s]  Use the vent
[25552.72s -> 25556.38s]  German vent German vent German vent. This is an among us thing
[25561.06s -> 25564.40s]  Probably come out and face us
[25564.94s -> 25574.53s]  Alright. Well, that was fun. I don't think we're getting in here. At least we made it in here. We did make it here though
[25580.26s -> 25586.10s]  What I'm getting hit markers someone someone has held up there
[25587.58s -> 25589.58s]  Oh, that was me dying. Oops
[25589.98s -> 25593.60s]  All right. Oh, that's it
[25593.60s -> 25601.29s]  Yeah, I'm just giving it one last look see I would assume that this area changes when you're supposed to come here
[25601.75s -> 25616.17s]  I'm it probably does. Where are you? Oh, you're in that building
[25616.63s -> 25620.34s]  I was just saying if there's a way to like
[25620.70s -> 25626.58s]  Like that it's not it's not really like a jet pack. This thing only has like a little boost
[25627.10s -> 25629.41s]  We would need like a helicopter or plane or something
[25648.60s -> 25658.96s]  Okay, well played. So maybe I could like
[25665.89s -> 25679.14s]  Yeah, it's alright that was fun though, yeah climb up his leg like a kitten
[25680.94s -> 25685.97s]  Hey, so we just find where the helicopter spawns are
[25688.50s -> 25695.90s]  This is a long stream. Um, it's long. I mean look we're having fun
[25696.54s -> 25715.21s]  All right the shotgun. All right turns people to stone help. I'm bleeding here. I'm my body's on fire
[25715.97s -> 25720.28s]  Are you loving in games when the shotgun shoots and it like rips to the right like this?
[25721.02s -> 25725.70s]  Yeah, what's up with that recoil? Oh
[25727.57s -> 25729.57s]  See the recoil on this look at this
[25730.21s -> 25739.82s]  It's a lot. This little pistols really
[25740.80s -> 25743.30s]  Powerful Jesus
[25744.58s -> 25746.76s]  Is your shotgun do that
[25749.93s -> 25752.69s]  Look at decent do you see how the how crazy the recoil is though, right?
[25761.65s -> 25771.39s]  I can barely even like aim it on my screen. It's like this guy sucks. It's uh, the L Ruby. Yeah
[25795.56s -> 25797.20s]  There's fun
[25797.20s -> 25802.28s]  Everybody this was far cry 6. This is italics. Let me shoot this guy. Let me let me get the kill
[25803.00s -> 25806.50s]  That's fun
[25806.50s -> 25811.72s]  If you don't know italics, this is Alex and he screams got a good scream
[25813.42s -> 25815.42s]  Yeah, it was fun
[25817.16s -> 25821.24s]  Make an objective make objectives for yourself. It's fun
[25822.48s -> 25824.20s]  Okay, so hey
[25824.20s -> 25831.91s]  The first part of the movies over we know what we did is we went actually up to the projector room and we
[25832.59s -> 25837.05s]  Fast-forwarded the movie with everyone still in there just being like what the fuck is going on
[25837.05s -> 25845.57s]  Why we fast-forwarding like the end, you know, you might be able to do that for the other guys
[25846.91s -> 25853.14s]  Maybe not, but that'd be pretty cool. All right. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for playing. Yeah
[25853.98s -> 25857.18s]  Somebody said I'll see you next year. Oh
[25857.54s -> 25863.24s]  Interesting you'll see me next year. How about um, are we are we doing the other thing the man of a damn?

[25868.88s -> 25876.64s]  That's like that's like in two weeks. Oh shit. Look at that. I gotta play man of a damn with it's Alex
[25876.64s -> 25878.64s]  That's how it works. Can't get rid of me that easy
[25878.68s -> 25880.28s]  Thought I wish I could
[25880.28s -> 25883.86s]  Got to try harder
[25884.38s -> 25890.67s]  Yeah, well, we'll see it talks again in a couple weeks or a man of a damn that's not the name of the game
[25890.67s -> 25892.67s]  That's just what the only one I could remember
[25895.80s -> 25900.37s]  All right, I'll tell you soon dude. I don't know if you're still streaming or not
[25900.37s -> 25905.49s]  But if not, no and I'll talk to you soon. I'm done. But thanks for playing. Yeah, it was
[25906.01s -> 25910.96s]  very enjoyable in in of itself just being shitty but also

[25989.82s -> 25993.06s]  My computer just crashed. I lost the access to my other monitor
[25993.66s -> 25997.46s]  Everything went on to my main screen. Everything was black for like 10 straight seconds. I have no audio
[25999.71s -> 26010.34s]  Say 50 in the chat if you can hear me. I need to know. Okay. All right, good
[26010.34s -> 26020.36s]  That was really weird. I have my left monitor is like dead. I think my graphics card crashed when I exited the game. All right
[26021.54s -> 26028.02s]  Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you again. Probably some point in the middle of the week. I'm probably gonna stream on

[26045.09s -> 26051.50s]  And you're probably asking what are we gonna play? I you know, I have no idea
[26051.50s -> 26058.87s]  I was thinking about maybe yeah, what are people saying in the chat smite smite smite one place smite smite smite
[26058.87s -> 26061.15s]  I mean, that's a fun one. That's all right
[26061.15s -> 26068.78s]  Oh, I mean a lot of people in the chat are saying it a lot of people are saying it. That's interesting
[26068.82s -> 26086.38s]  Yeah, well, maybe we'll play smite. We said fuck you. Come on. Just relax man. There's no need for that kind of vulgarity
[26086.52s -> 26091.18s]  What about the Nickelodeon all-star bra? Oh that did come out. That's not a bad idea
[26091.54s -> 26094.84s]  We'll figure out something some of the look just keep an eye on the sauce

[26125.04s -> 26127.46s]  Money on this stream it sees a lot
[26128.20s -> 26132.06s]  Tried to be pretty transparent about how much money this stream takes in
[26132.58s -> 26136.97s]  There's no you don't need to like give this stream a shitload of money. Please don't
[26141.63s -> 26146.79s]  If you give this channel five dollars a month, it's more than enough way more than enough
[26147.27s -> 26155.18s]  It realistically should nobody should really be ever giving this channel more than that amount per month. I
[26156.86s -> 26159.34s]  can't like stop people from doing that but I
[26160.75s -> 26164.95s]  You know, you guys know how much good guy 98

[26176.82s -> 26179.62s]  Because I'm not I just hope people know that I don't
[26180.90s -> 26182.90s]  Don't think so much as I need to say
[26183.26s -> 26186.71s]  I'm just trying to do trying to do what I'm doing
