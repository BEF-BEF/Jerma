[409.85s -> 412.73s]  It's high
[413.37s -> 414.25s]  What's his rank? Okay
[414.25s -> 418.57s]  I'm gonna make i'm gonna lose and win the amount of games it takes to be at that exact number
[418.65s -> 423.61s]  And I know he plays every night pst before bed. I'm gonna find this motherfucker and i'm gonna troll him
[424.09s -> 429.96s]  Uh, this is the die dallas encounter as you can see in the top left
[429.96s -> 432.20s]  This is the first thing i'm gonna play this 3do night. Welcome everybody
[433.77s -> 435.77s]  Uh, this is like a five cd

[447.13s -> 450.33s]  Last time we played 3do
[450.33s -> 453.69s]  Pause the stream. I have to make tortellini. We don't have like 12 minutes for you to do that
[454.25s -> 456.73s]  If you said microwave tortellini, sure
[457.82s -> 460.15s]  That's like a minute
[460.15s -> 465.53s]  Make tortellini. That's too long
[465.61s -> 467.61s]  pause pause pause
[468.71s -> 472.39s]  No, I don't want to rush them because if you rush tortellini, you're gonna screw it all up
[474.74s -> 476.74s]  There's al dente and then there's no
[477.06s -> 480.26s]  Six minutes five minutes. He's gonna rush it and it's gonna be chewy and he's gonna be pissed at us

[562.63s -> 564.15s]  That's a really good way
[564.15s -> 568.23s]  I know but no i'm not all right. Are you ready to play? Let's go to die dallas and encounter

[610.62s -> 612.47s]  six
[612.47s -> 614.47s]  final days of the first
[615.17s -> 623.24s]  interstellar war
[623.26s -> 625.26s]  Oh, it's kind of like star wars
[629.32s -> 631.32s]  Casey anything on the scanners?
[636.04s -> 638.28s]  Are they setting up a couch?

[653.48s -> 659.75s]  Why do they look like burger king employees?
[669.86s -> 671.86s]  He's got a burger king hat on
[671.86s -> 689.54s]  Can we get out omega l got him?
[692.36s -> 695.08s]  McDonald's versus burger king interstellar war
[697.80s -> 702.36s]  He got hit pretty bad but the med techs are trying to fix you up with life support and artificial senses
[703.32s -> 708.52s]  You just hang in there case. Okay, and when conglomerates get that big and mcdonald's owns planets
[709.56s -> 711.56s]  It wouldn't be two months later
[711.64s -> 717.37s]  Audio link is activated cutting in visual in three two one
[720.86s -> 727.06s]  Wait, am I the ship?
[727.06s -> 741.24s]  Casey it's airy. I'm the ship your mind has been placed in a cerebral support mechanism device
[742.04s -> 746.04s]  That when she's trying to say you're a brain in a box case asmr
[746.44s -> 758.76s]  You are a air. I can't even fucking say it. You know what i'm saying. Look at yourself
[761.05s -> 764.33s]  Now you may not look the same on the outside, but I know it's you on the inside
[766.09s -> 772.17s]  And we need to know if you can respond use the virtual interface in front of the transmitter. Yes
[774.07s -> 777.35s]  Don't be now, please don't be shoot me with a gun. You have a gun
[777.99s -> 782.22s]  Shoot me with a gun, please
[782.70s -> 792.23s]  Wait what interface help use the yes no buttons to communicate perform analysis on certain objects
[793.10s -> 800.58s]  Use to send stored analysis data use to acquire loose objects activates a general purpose flood light
[801.58s -> 813.48s]  Activates your multi-light transmitter initiates the probe system perform system diagnostics launches your onboard probe boost casey's onboard thruster. Oh shit. Okay
[814.20s -> 816.20s]  activate virtual interfaces are
[816.68s -> 824.42s]  Select and navigate is that activate navigation control? I can I can fly around. Oh this
[824.90s -> 834.97s]  This just got way more interesting. Okay, go and help. Oh, here we go. I can say yes and no
[835.13s -> 837.66s]  All right. Should I say no?
[837.66s -> 843.45s]  What did I just do?
[843.45s -> 846.18s]  You didn't give me no, don't shut me off
[846.98s -> 853.94s]  Shut it down
[853.94s -> 858.42s]  Did I just get the one of the endings of the game by accidentally not doing anything? Shut them down?
[861.16s -> 863.16s]  How long did it take to build that thing?
[863.32s -> 878.23s]  And we need to know if you can respond if you can use the virtual interface in front of you transmit a no
[885.54s -> 890.82s]  Yes, you probably haven't heard but uh the war is over we flame their butts at exeter three
[891.14s -> 892.98s]  Baccar lost a third of their fleet
[892.98s -> 898.98s]  They went running with their tails between their legs straight to the taladarans practically begged them to negotiate a peace treaty
[899.30s -> 900.74s]  We won
[900.74s -> 904.58s]  You know, of course that put us out of a job, but you know, hey war is hell, right?
[905.46s -> 909.62s]  So right now you're aboard the artemis finest salvage vessel in the sector
[910.10s -> 913.70s]  Zach and I cobbled her together from a couple of surplus alliance transports
[914.26s -> 919.30s]  Oh, not to mention the engines that we sort of borrow stall stall
[920.50s -> 924.25s]  May not look like much stolen engine detected self-destruct
[924.87s -> 929.85s]  We thought we'd help salvage some of the vicar ships. We helped disable. It's the very least we could do
[930.49s -> 935.69s]  We see it. There's a lot of uh, very tasty salvage just floating around out there
[937.13s -> 939.13s]  All right. Now let's get really really personal
[942.84s -> 945.59s]  We liberated you from the lab
[945.99s -> 948.31s]  Zach wired your interface. Are you two together?
[949.19s -> 950.23s]  Are you dating?
[950.23s -> 960.90s]  I'll be back casey. Are you two dating? What do you say guys? Let's do some hunting. Oh, I can't do anything
[961.38s -> 968.66s]  It's reverse c man. Yeah, i'm the one that responds the draillac system
[969.38s -> 971.22s]  50 hours later
[971.22s -> 975.88s]  So we're why can't you just say like
[975.88s -> 978.95s]  Two days three days
[978.95s -> 980.31s]  50 hours
[980.31s -> 997.88s]  What's the point of this? What are we what are we supposed to be doing around the sector for two days now?
[998.20s -> 1000.60s]  Maybe we finally got something activating view screens
[1000.76s -> 1006.49s]  Okay, we've we got something we have to go out there and clear this
[1006.89s -> 1009.45s]  Hey case, what do you say you want to take your uh new equipment for a test?
[1009.53s -> 1013.37s]  Yeah, let's go. Why don't you go ahead and activate your remote control probe casey
[1013.45s -> 1015.45s]  See if you can get us a better look at this derelict
[1018.01s -> 1020.44s]  Probe where's the probe? All right
[1024.58s -> 1026.58s]  Which was the probe data?
[1026.58s -> 1033.94s]  Is this like oxygen? All right. Did I just turn it into hydrogen? Okay, start up all subsystems now
[1034.66s -> 1044.42s]  Oh shit start up subs. Wait, wait, I need the help launches your onboard probe
[1045.67s -> 1049.13s]  Okay, here we go. The probe is down here
[1049.13s -> 1055.42s]  No probe data and analyze. Yes on
[1059.11s -> 1061.99s]  Okay, grapple arm system
[1063.72s -> 1067.22s]  um launch
[1067.22s -> 1080.33s]  Probe, what am I doing? All analysis system. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Did I do it?
[1086.38s -> 1088.94s]  What's happening? You didn't give me very good instructions
[1089.96s -> 1100.60s]  Analysis, what's the analysis one? All right analysis. All right, put the probe on run your diagnostics run your diagnostics
[1101.53s -> 1107.45s]  Launches you perform system diagnostics on the probe. Oh, it's this one. All right
[1107.99s -> 1114.25s]  Diagnostics thing what we got. All right launch probe
[1118.10s -> 1126.81s]  Diagnosing what does it what it would look like? Okay at this point you could have done it yourself
[1127.13s -> 1139.37s]  Why are you trying to get the toaster to do these very complicated tasks? Okay, deploy the probe casey deploy the probe
[1141.29s -> 1143.29s]  Opening probe bay doors
[1143.37s -> 1153.45s]  Now it's me
[1153.45s -> 1155.45s]  Is that the dallas?
[1162.04s -> 1167.24s]  I miss these old cg cutscenes. They look so strange and almost terrifying in a way
[1169.63s -> 1171.15s]  Casey I gotta ask you
[1171.15s -> 1175.39s]  What does it feel like having your eyes and ears floating around in a little ball while the rest of you is back here with us?
[1176.43s -> 1179.95s]  It's fucking horrible. It feels like shit. It's not even funny to joke about
[1180.27s -> 1185.55s]  Your guidance system is pretty much automatic so you can concentrate on the job. Most other functions are up to you
[1187.63s -> 1191.07s]  Yes, oh wait what close call there buddy
[1192.03s -> 1197.71s]  Collision avoidance seems to be working grab. What do I do? All right, let's try your computer link. See how it works
[1198.27s -> 1199.23s]  Why don't you run?
[1199.23s -> 1202.91s]  Uh an id check on this pile of junk see if you can get the name of the ship
[1203.55s -> 1207.71s]  Id check what the cargo might have been am I pulling them over id check?
[1208.76s -> 1213.31s]  Which one is that?
[1216.65s -> 1217.85s]  It's a
[1217.85s -> 1219.85s]  I can't read that. It's so blurry
[1219.93s -> 1223.77s]  What is it? You're pulling them over
[1226.56s -> 1228.56s]  You know how fast you were going?
[1228.64s -> 1239.52s]  14 light years per day this is a 12 light year per day zone using your laser torch upper right hand switch
[1240.24s -> 1244.64s]  Should pump enough juice into the system pop that door wide open. Be careful casey
[1244.72s -> 1248.40s]  Vakar have been known to booby trap their hulks. Come on. Give me that one
[1249.28s -> 1250.78s]  Wait, wait, wait
[1250.78s -> 1253.66s]  I missed all of that. It said wait. Can you
[1258.57s -> 1260.57s]  They booby trap the hulls
[1265.45s -> 1269.45s]  Casey I warned you about traps. You just blew our only pro
[1270.09s -> 1272.97s]  Now we have to go back and start all over again. Thank you

[1292.51s -> 1294.51s]  Collect use the floodlight
[1295.15s -> 1297.47s]  Put the thrusters up launch the probe
[1303.52s -> 1305.48s]  What?
[1305.48s -> 1312.52s]  Casey I warned you about traps. You just blew our only probe. I'm like a dog that gets the paper towel roll
[1314.80s -> 1316.16s]  Put that down
[1316.16s -> 1320.52s]  No, i'm not gonna put it down. Give me that and then you get it back and then somehow he gets it again

[1492.43s -> 1499.76s]  Wait, let me see. What was analysis on it? Wait, wait, hold on analysis
[1501.63s -> 1503.44s]  No

[1608.96s -> 1611.12s]  Step two is to probe and then diagnostics
[1611.92s -> 1615.32s]  Step three analysis of the ship blow the hatch
[1615.48s -> 1621.56s]  You'll need to use your laser torch to open the cargo door when your laser arms itself aimed on the upper left door controls
[1621.64s -> 1623.40s]  Why is this just a guide?
[1623.40s -> 1627.13s]  This is just a guide how to do every fucking puzzle in the game
[1627.85s -> 1638.88s]  Who is the laser torch?
[1638.88s -> 1644.88s]  I don't have a laser torch. What the hell is that talking about?

[1676.72s -> 1681.84s]  Oh scary actually did kind of scare me. I always thought you found aliens quite
[1682.92s -> 1684.22s]  attractive

[1717.66s -> 1724.22s]  I don't see anything
[1724.22s -> 1726.48s]  analyze
[1726.48s -> 1729.45s]  Analyze the current environment launch the probe
[1735.00s -> 1745.15s]  All right analyzing the ship fucking blows
[1747.69s -> 1753.07s]  Yeah, this actually sucks. It's just a giant hallway. Where's the
[1754.12s -> 1755.16s]  Kitchen
[1755.16s -> 1762.89s]  There's a sleeping quarters. You just float around in here. Where do you go to the bathroom?

[1773.74s -> 1775.74s]  Get this fucking wrong every time don't they?
[1776.76s -> 1780.76s]  Anytime there's an alien spacecraft or an unknown encounter, right?
[1781.56s -> 1782.92s]  It's always like this
[1782.92s -> 1785.24s]  It's never like a kitchen. They never show like this like the cook
[1786.75s -> 1791.33s]  There's never a kitchen. There's never a living room. It's always just weird and oh abnormal
[1795.02s -> 1798.64s]  There's no bedrooms
[1798.64s -> 1800.64s]  Scary ship is just scary ship

[1811.06s -> 1826.80s]  All right analyzing at least we got a nice souvenir. It's gonna be some kind of magical power
[1831.87s -> 1834.03s]  As well come on in case he's just not our day
[1834.75s -> 1842.18s]  Wait, I just throw it down the hallway
[1842.18s -> 1845.92s]  Didn't she just say that that belongs with the dead?
[1846.56s -> 1848.56s]  I'm just gonna toss it down the hall
[1852.19s -> 1854.19s]  It's kind of disrespectful
[1859.02s -> 1862.06s]  This whole sector's why not like put it with this body
[1862.38s -> 1866.29s]  I agree a Magellan cluster
[1867.01s -> 1872.91s]  Why just frisbee it down the hall lv 426. Oh, not there what I was thinking about
[1873.07s -> 1876.51s]  What time we surprised the hell out of that wing of the car cruiser just leaving the wheel?

[1885.79s -> 1888.91s]  Not only my third wheel in this current friend group
[1889.63s -> 1893.65s]  They turned me into a fucking like task robot
[1899.82s -> 1901.82s]  That's extra third wheel

[1983.12s -> 1985.10s]  What?
[1985.10s -> 1989.60s]  Yeah, instead of like zirking off. You probably should have been watching the out your windshield
[1998.56s -> 2001.78s]  Oh no, uh analyze the situation
[2006.22s -> 2009.50s]  Oh god, damn it. Give me a fucking break. What?
[2010.14s -> 2015.34s]  No, why why why are you in this? I don't want you in here. I don't want you to do this
[2015.42s -> 2017.31s]  I don't want to do this game
[2017.31s -> 2020.30s]  I don't want to do this one
[2020.30s -> 2022.30s]  Why is this here? It better not be timed
[2022.70s -> 2025.39s]  Okay, what do I what? Okay power
[2026.18s -> 2030.40s]  power grid
[2030.40s -> 2032.30s]  All right
[2032.30s -> 2035.66s]  They've all just turned wwe into the turnbuckle move
[2037.50s -> 2049.14s]  Hurry save the ship. Is this what it wants?
[2049.86s -> 2053.60s]  power
[2053.60s -> 2056.46s]  Okay, power one power two
[2057.10s -> 2058.62s]  Power three
[2058.62s -> 2063.14s]  Did I do it connect multiple systems failure? Where's the other one?
[2065.94s -> 2068.42s]  Is this one this one up here I can't is that one up there
[2069.06s -> 2076.00s]  Is that is that is it? I do it. Is that it? I think that's it
[2076.64s -> 2079.36s]  all four sides
[2079.36s -> 2082.43s]  Well, shit. Okay. Hold on
[2082.67s -> 2091.95s]  Damn it. All right. So this has to go
[2092.19s -> 2096.69s]  Fucking can't believe this shit is in here right now
[2097.41s -> 2100.48s]  No, that was right. But then how do I get this one?
[2122.35s -> 2125.63s]  I fucking hate these things. I hate these
[2126.19s -> 2129.15s]  Why of all the things does it have to be a light puzzle?
[2129.79s -> 2136.78s]  What happened?
[2136.78s -> 2138.46s]  I why
[2138.46s -> 2151.78s]  I hate these things
[2151.78s -> 2155.78s]  If you told me that I was gonna have to do light puzzles like turn the pipe shit again
[2156.61s -> 2186.16s]  I would have shit my pants on camera instead. It's not too late to do that. No, it is too late. No
[2189.46s -> 2191.46s]  No, no, no, no, no, no
[2202.69s -> 2204.69s]  I fucking hate this shit
[2224.56s -> 2243.10s]  No
[2243.10s -> 2249.18s]  God damn it. It has to connect to this one, but I can't get that one to do what I want it to do
[2258.27s -> 2263.71s]  Work backwards work backwards hurry before the time runs out up this way down. Oh my fucking god
[2263.71s -> 2276.05s]  I hate this more than anything calm down and concentrate. I'm gonna but I
[2276.69s -> 2282.77s]  Calm down or concentrate or drop kick 3do through my hallway. Fuck which one of those bolts sound pretty good to me right now
[2329.82s -> 2333.01s]  That's not it. Okay, uh analyze say no
[2333.81s -> 2335.33s]  No
[2335.33s -> 2336.85s]  No, no
[2336.85s -> 2342.48s]  no
[2343.49s -> 2350.75s]  I can't wait for one to turn to the camera and there's one small scratch on the forehead with a tiny bit of blood
[2357.58s -> 2359.58s]  I'm gonna blame me
[2369.02s -> 2372.46s]  They were asleep they didn't even crash and get hurt
[2372.46s -> 2392.91s]  We're dead in the news bad news first, what are you crazy bad has taken us with it there's no way to get clear without our thrusters
[2393.71s -> 2397.92s]  We can do it. Do we still have short-range communications? That's me
[2398.48s -> 2400.53s]  Send a distress call
[2400.53s -> 2406.05s]  To who what you think this thing is a ship zack. I don't know but maybe whoever or whatever's on board can help us
[2406.93s -> 2409.81s]  Yeah, they're not too torqued at you for bashing. See they don't know but
[2410.29s -> 2413.33s]  I mean this argument's going up to the amazon cloud and they don't even know
[2423.60s -> 2435.81s]  Id check seems to be of some type of composite material surprise unknown any response to a distress call
[2439.68s -> 2444.08s]  So either we figure out how to alter our course we're toast
[2446.64s -> 2449.07s]  I hope that we eat first
[2449.47s -> 2459.09s]  Casey there activate your probe. Let's see what we're dealing with out there. Okay
[2459.97s -> 2467.22s]  Oh, that's not the probe. All right probe on
[2468.94s -> 2472.67s]  Get ready to launch probe
[2472.67s -> 2477.10s]  launching probe
[2477.10s -> 2478.62s]  Keep voice
[2478.62s -> 2481.89s]  I will but when I need it propulsion systems activated
[2482.61s -> 2491.14s]  Analysis system activated launch probe probe ready
[2491.86s -> 2501.70s]  analyzing data
[2501.70s -> 2506.11s]  sending probe now in three two one
[2508.34s -> 2510.34s]  zero
[2510.90s -> 2514.18s]  I just said that stop trying to overstep me
[2514.82s -> 2519.62s]  Always needing to one-up me. There's no way to continue further our relationship
[2530.83s -> 2538.37s]  Careful out there a better robot voice. Is it not good? I can't I don't know what it is. I can't tell
[2539.01s -> 2544.06s]  It was stuck in it. There's a big black hole here
[2546.56s -> 2550.64s]  Do a fart with the robot filter. All right, this better be worth like five million from that one guy
[2551.52s -> 2566.43s]  I don't even know what it sounds like
[2566.43s -> 2568.67s]  This looks like a cake. Is this even a ship?
[2570.08s -> 2572.00s]  This is a fucking calzone
[2572.00s -> 2573.36s]  What is this?
[2573.36s -> 2588.93s]  Harry never seen anything like this. Yeah
[2590.05s -> 2592.05s]  Either of I some kind of composite
[2592.69s -> 2597.25s]  Alloy or secreted material, I mean did they they build this stuff or grow it
[2599.78s -> 2601.78s]  Right. This is a complete unknown
[2604.74s -> 2608.30s]  Wait, did you say galaxy is full of unknowns my young son
[2610.22s -> 2612.22s]  Is that what you said?
[2612.22s -> 2621.14s]  Yeah, and her sunk a shaft right into the main colony practically wiped out the whole race before the exolinguist established communications
[2621.22s -> 2626.10s]  Yeah, well, let's be careful because you're no exolinguist. Hey, I happen to speak 27 languages
[2626.26s -> 2630.90s]  Yeah, three phrases more beer. Where's the head and if you want to come by
[2631.38s -> 2632.74s]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah
[2632.74s -> 2638.50s]  Reorder I have placed a pack of beer on your episode. How are you here? No, no, dude
[2638.58s -> 2643.86s]  What the fuck alexa hold your position casey zack and I are joining you what what we are
[2644.50s -> 2646.10s]  You got a better idea
[2646.10s -> 2650.58s]  I guess we don't have much of a choice. All right, let's suit up. I'm going in
[2651.78s -> 2656.19s]  Wait, they're going in
[2666.90s -> 2669.86s]  They've been computer generated those aren't even real faces anymore
[2670.66s -> 2683.90s]  That's not video footage. That's actually 3d in the game spy kids
[2684.86s -> 2695.49s]  It's like it's 3d
[2706.02s -> 2709.70s]  Be careful if you if you trust too much you'll just incinerate the person behind you
[2710.78s -> 2714.94s]  Uh, that's just uh, where's the gravity field? Where is this gravity field?
[2719.68s -> 2721.68s]  They're gonna go soaring into space
[2732.22s -> 2734.22s]  Oh, but don't forget me
[2734.46s -> 2744.58s]  That's definitely a ship take off can I shine my light in there?
[2754.50s -> 2755.54s]  Okay
[2755.54s -> 2762.58s]  I will I will do the one or two buttons. I've been able to press this entire game. What do you say?
[2763.14s -> 2777.02s]  This looks actually pretty scary in here. It's fluid on the wall. What is that?
[2777.66s -> 2779.23s]  See that
[2779.23s -> 2781.23s]  What's that? It's like a tail
[2792.02s -> 2793.38s]  the ship
[2793.38s -> 2814.08s]  It's gonna be face huggers. I feel so
[2814.80s -> 2821.36s]  Like not needed
[2821.36s -> 2826.58s]  Why am I just the peter dinklage ghost that they've re-recorded all his lines. What's his name?
[2827.22s -> 2831.90s]  I just come up with tutorial messages every like five hours
[2841.71s -> 2846.14s]  Actual side character. I can't even say yes and no
[2846.78s -> 2859.68s]  This is a pretty good dvd menu game
[2862.21s -> 2864.21s]  It's a dvd menu
[2864.37s -> 2875.70s]  It's a dvd. This is just the special features on prometheus. All right, what does it want me to do grab it analyze?
[2879.42s -> 2881.42s]  That is basically the 3d. Oh, yeah
[2883.89s -> 2897.33s]  Something in there is an egg in there the egg in there. There's an egg. Please insert disc two
[2898.05s -> 2902.67s]  Oh shit, this is disc four right here
[2910.27s -> 2912.27s]  All right. Hold on. It's not gonna break, right?
[2915.02s -> 2918.34s]  DVD game
[2918.34s -> 2920.93s]  All right disc two in
[2920.93s -> 2922.75s]  What did I just press?
[2922.75s -> 2924.75s]  I did like a code blue
[2925.07s -> 2935.28s]  What is that?
[2935.28s -> 2936.40s]  Okay
[2936.40s -> 2947.66s]  So now what? I'll just say now insert disc one just needed to load the video into cache. I did it
[2948.22s -> 2963.10s]  There's a brain in here. Oh wait
[2967.70s -> 2973.68s]  Oh, that's not even me put your face in there
[2981.90s -> 2983.90s]  I wonder what this is
[2984.14s -> 2997.38s]  Take the helmet off and sticks her head in it. Take it off
[2997.94s -> 3005.87s]  Wait, they're actually gonna take these up. It does not seem like a very firm seal
[3006.27s -> 3010.35s]  The disc tray on the fucking 3do is more firm seal than that
[3026.99s -> 3031.63s]  Retired they didn't feel like animating that anymore too much 3d work
[3043.38s -> 3045.38s]  Why is she still 3d
[3046.59s -> 3050.45s]  She's still oh, no, no, no. Okay now they're not anymore
[3063.46s -> 3065.46s]  I don't think it knows what a gun is
[3067.47s -> 3069.47s]  Why would you touch this what are you doing?
[3070.11s -> 3074.91s]  This doesn't know what a gun is what you this is not the triceratops from jurassic park
[3079.23s -> 3082.30s]  That's the reason for the hole in the other room
[3082.86s -> 3084.69s]  what
[3084.69s -> 3090.29s]  Ship's been invaded by crin cringe. Oh what you just said was so cringe kind of like piranhas
[3090.85s -> 3092.85s]  It could be thousands of them in here
[3093.60s -> 3095.60s]  Thousands of piranhas great
[3098.75s -> 3102.03s]  Something in the head built-in flashlight. No, it's gonna explode
[3103.39s -> 3105.47s]  Maybe it's one of the ways they communicate it's gonna explode
[3106.43s -> 3112.80s]  It's dead
[3112.80s -> 3117.12s]  See that was a last ditch communication like tell my wife. I love her
[3117.76s -> 3121.44s]  Stuff is harder than a drill sergeant's head crin can do this
[3122.08s -> 3123.52s]  We have no idea
[3123.52s -> 3127.68s]  That could have been the password that could have been like the password to the laptop that has all the btc on it from like
[3127.76s -> 3130.00s]  fucking 2004
[3130.00s -> 3140.19s]  We'll never know
[3140.19s -> 3143.95s]  I don't think this thing's dead
[3143.95s -> 3146.83s]  No, it's not it's good. It's wagging its tail
[3147.55s -> 3153.04s]  We just get duped
[3156.16s -> 3163.62s]  Well wick always said the most terrifying thing he ever saw was a full-scale crin attack
[3164.82s -> 3166.82s]  Old man hard wick actually talked to you
[3168.24s -> 3170.24s]  Actually, we got along quite well
[3173.06s -> 3175.06s]  This just really is what it's like to be a side character
[3175.62s -> 3178.66s]  Like a party member that gives advice sometimes that doesn't do any of the game playing
[3179.30s -> 3181.54s]  You just kind of walk around and look at walls and stuff
[3185.65s -> 3191.46s]  Yeah, i'd say so let's try opening this thing careful
[3193.44s -> 3196.08s]  Yeah, I have my list of tutorial messages I can show up
[3199.04s -> 3201.04s]  uh
[3201.12s -> 3204.40s]  Did you know that if you press tab you can get to the map?
[3208.27s -> 3211.94s]  Wait a minute that casey can make it through me me me
[3213.62s -> 3215.62s]  Go ahead casey see if you can make it through
[3216.10s -> 3228.72s]  Come on go squeeze in there. I found the heart
[3229.44s -> 3233.28s]  There's gonna be some kind of jewel in here. We're gonna take the jewel in indiana jones style. The whole thing's gonna collapse
[3235.44s -> 3237.44s]  Pods, this is where they burrow their larva
[3250.11s -> 3259.81s]  Alexa I was just gonna yell like alexa order this but I
[3260.45s -> 3263.57s]  It was a joke like as if it's here, but it's not here and I can say that out loud
[3263.97s -> 3266.21s]  But I don't want to say that out loud because some of you might actually have it
[3267.07s -> 3271.71s]  And you might i'm up on your tv speakers. I can't do that either
[3274.13s -> 3276.29s]  Alexa order of jewel pods
[3279.95s -> 3297.06s]  What's that jewel pods there's a crab in there what casey
[3298.02s -> 3301.78s]  Casey what happened right there? Yeah, did you see anything that looked like navigational controls?
[3309.17s -> 3310.69s]  Oh, uh
[3310.69s -> 3312.69s]  Yeah, um, um, no
[3313.33s -> 3315.33s]  Guess we better try another one of these doors
[3316.69s -> 3319.02s]  Yeah
[3319.02s -> 3321.02s]  Hey casey, let's try this one
[3326.77s -> 3328.85s]  slow robot
[3328.85s -> 3331.81s]  Come on. Give me a break. They built me with parts that they had lying around
[3333.09s -> 3337.65s]  How many like random graphics cards do you still have in your closet? I thought casey was the only one that could open these
[3338.61s -> 3342.61s]  Guys I held on to a gtx 270 for like six fucking years
[3345.60s -> 3347.92s]  Sorry, I don't have the latest hardware built into this guy
[3355.02s -> 3362.24s]  Why I don't know because just in case I needed it for something. I don't have it anymore. It's gone now
[3365.71s -> 3368.75s]  I hold on to a lot of computer hardware like you're supposed to hold on to your tax returns
[3369.63s -> 3371.15s]  seven years
[3371.15s -> 3375.54s]  And then and I get rid of it. Oh my god. Why are you drinking like the random acid?
[3378.82s -> 3380.50s]  what
[3380.50s -> 3382.50s]  What the fuck?
[3385.92s -> 3388.67s]  You always didn't know how to make me laugh
[3388.67s -> 3390.67s]  Why don't you walk up to a random?
[3392.51s -> 3395.14s]  What the hell are you looking at cyclops?
[3398.53s -> 3402.66s]  What is happening really what is happening in this game
[3406.43s -> 3411.47s]  You don't know what's so damn funny, right? That was an honest mistake. Oh, trust me for my angle. It was hilarious
[3412.83s -> 3414.83s]  Can can we just go now?
[3415.15s -> 3418.51s]  This is turning into an snl skin first now that you're all refreshed
[3419.87s -> 3426.90s]  Hey
[3427.94s -> 3430.43s]  Well, all of a sudden i'm r2 d2
[3433.17s -> 3437.41s]  So let me okay. I gotta break this down. Let me get this straight guy walks into room in an alien spacecraft
[3437.65s -> 3439.65s]  And it's all this weird shit around it
[3439.71s -> 3441.73s]  Immediately drinks out of the first liquid
[3442.78s -> 3445.42s]  That you find the first thing that's holding liquid you just start drinking it
[3447.76s -> 3449.76s]  Is this a dnd campaign?
[3449.84s -> 3451.84s]  with new players
[3452.72s -> 3459.44s]  There's no sign of any weapons whatsoever
[3459.84s -> 3463.81s]  I didn't even put up a fight. Maybe they didn't have any weapons
[3464.37s -> 3469.22s]  They built a spaceship you enter a room with a strange fountain
[3469.86s -> 3473.14s]  And inside I drink out of the fountain. I'm saying maybe it shows not
[3475.38s -> 3477.38s]  Okay, roll I guess um
[3477.62s -> 3497.52s]  But this one is different roll for hydration
[3498.56s -> 3504.00s]  Oh, here we go. This is the real this is the room now. Oh, we really did it now people are porting into here
[3506.70s -> 3508.22s]  Get the weapons ready
[3508.22s -> 3512.37s]  What do I have? I have robot fork penis. I'm ready
[3513.17s -> 3515.17s]  Looks like some kind of central hub
[3516.51s -> 3519.39s]  Seems heavily reinforced you think this would uh, keep those crayon out
[3520.11s -> 3521.79s]  I don't know maybe
[3521.79s -> 3523.79s]  But we're not staying here to find out
[3524.35s -> 3526.67s]  Gotta steer this thing away from the star. Remember?
[3527.31s -> 3529.57s]  Yeah
[3529.57s -> 3531.97s]  These symbols over the doors might tell us what's on the other side
[3533.25s -> 3536.90s]  Oh, they're not porting in what are they doing?
[3537.06s -> 3541.17s]  Why am I so interested in this game still I kind of am don't you want to know what's happening?
[3541.25s -> 3542.85s]  I kind of want to know the story
[3542.85s -> 3544.61s]  I'm I want to know
[3544.61s -> 3562.34s]  I'm getting a little invested. Yeah, me too
[3569.09s -> 3571.09s]  So this must be the died alice
[3571.17s -> 3578.62s]  Should I say something? Hey casey, we can't come up with anything here. All these doors are sealed
[3579.02s -> 3583.34s]  We need your help to open them. Let's start with the one to the left of the door. We came in
[3584.22s -> 3588.02s]  That one
[3588.02s -> 3591.57s]  Oh no, it's gonna be a puzzle
[3592.45s -> 3594.10s]  Okay
[3594.10s -> 3596.10s]  w o i
[3598.43s -> 3601.33s]  bulk
[3601.33s -> 3604.91s]  bolt
[3604.91s -> 3615.84s]  Analyze the door. Okay. It looks like there is a dial in there. It's gonna be a puzzle something maybe
[3617.34s -> 3618.94s]  alien pattern found
[3618.94s -> 3621.79s]  chroma symbols
[3621.79s -> 3623.15s]  Take a look at this
[3623.15s -> 3628.74s]  possible language
[3628.74s -> 3633.22s]  Take a look at that data. Okay. Can I open it? What else can we do?
[3633.86s -> 3643.52s]  Enhance it the playstation language
[3646.78s -> 3648.54s]  Yeah, it is
[3648.54s -> 3656.22s]  Okay, I have the data so now I go back
[3657.95s -> 3660.43s]  I've got hey, yes, I found something
[3663.76s -> 3665.76s]  Okay, so this is what's this look like?
[3666.08s -> 3670.24s]  So now how can I move this around?
[3671.44s -> 3672.96s]  Analyze it again
[3672.96s -> 3675.79s]  Press the button. I can't press anything
[3676.35s -> 3678.91s]  Press no, I have this
[3679.23s -> 3683.95s]  This is a color scheme and an alien language, but can I go back and say hey, I found something
[3684.83s -> 3686.19s]  Use your fork
[3686.19s -> 3688.27s]  Use the rainbow

[3707.94s -> 3719.26s]  What is it doing? I have to make what do I have to make?
[3726.62s -> 3731.10s]  One of those symbols, but I don't know what symbol is supposed to make just complete the whole thing
[3738.26s -> 3740.69s]  Uh
[3742.86s -> 3747.34s]  Like that

[3759.95s -> 3761.95s]  Okay, hold on
[3762.91s -> 3771.72s]  All right, thank you not this shit i'm missing the top right

[3854.44s -> 3857.84s]  Okay, then which one of these can go to the bottom right, um
[3864.21s -> 3871.92s]  Wait, hold on now that stays there I need one to go across
[3875.16s -> 3878.24s]  That and then I need this one to go this way and then I need

[4153.46s -> 4160.02s]  I don't know. I'm just cheating so i'm cheating. I don't care. This is stupid
[4160.74s -> 4163.54s]  I'm not doing this like saturday morning sunday morning paper
[4164.42s -> 4166.42s]  Bullshit puzzle. It's stupid
[4166.66s -> 4179.38s]  That doesn't tell you how to beat it. No, it just tells you that it exists
[4180.10s -> 4184.29s]  It's simple
[4184.29s -> 4187.57s]  It's not simple. It's stupid. It's I hate it
[4189.33s -> 4197.52s]  Wait, maybe it is simple. Hold on
[4226.39s -> 4229.76s]  Oh

[4247.43s -> 4250.31s]  Just relax relax
[4258.80s -> 4260.40s]  This walkthrough doesn't work
[4260.40s -> 4263.92s]  Come on the walkthrough king. He's gonna get me
[4268.79s -> 4271.27s]  Purple door. What this isn't even
[4276.15s -> 4279.03s]  What the fuck? None of these these are all doesn't make any sense
[4279.83s -> 4290.24s]  They're all this one's not even a paragraph long. I beat this puzzle when I was four
[4290.24s -> 4296.66s]  You didn't even own a 3do. None of you did this radio like sold 400 copies. You're not one of them. It's randomized
[4297.14s -> 4302.05s]  No, it's not
[4302.05s -> 4317.01s]  Wait, oh, here we go. There's a play. There's a hold on this walkthrough. I don't know
[4318.29s -> 4320.05s]  I hate it
[4320.05s -> 4325.73s]  Where's the just it's just not even a puzzle
[4330.05s -> 4332.37s]  All right, the didalus encounter walkthrough part two
[4339.46s -> 4341.46s]  dude all these
[4341.46s -> 4358.08s]  Where is this part of the fucking game? Oh, it's on part four. Okay match each one
[4358.40s -> 4362.64s]  I know I know it's probably easy but like I i'd rather fucking eat the disc than do this
[4367.65s -> 4373.16s]  All right. Got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Here we go
[4375.11s -> 4379.11s]  Wait, what this is?
[4379.11s -> 4381.43s]  No, I just skipped to the next video. Why is
[4381.97s -> 4385.03s]  YouTube fuck youtube. Why is next video?
[4385.83s -> 4390.47s]  Two pixels away from the play button fucking move that shit your website sucks
[4399.78s -> 4403.06s]  This walkthrough doesn't even have this part because it's on easy this
[4404.34s -> 4407.06s]  Walkthrough i'm watching is on easy. So it only has the first part
[4412.88s -> 4415.54s]  The only reason why we have part two is because the game's on medium
[4418.44s -> 4420.44s]  Hey
[4427.16s -> 4430.60s]  God damn it. Not even the walkthrough could help me because the walkthrough is on easy
[4432.61s -> 4434.61s]  You had it move the bottom left one
[4441.94s -> 4445.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, what do you know what happened top left the top left one
[4447.96s -> 4449.96s]  Oh
[4452.44s -> 4454.44s]  I don't want to do it again
[4461.06s -> 4469.83s]  That one wasn't even hard

[4488.82s -> 4490.50s]  I do outrank you
[4490.50s -> 4494.98s]  You did outrank me and the only reason you did was because you were a lot better at kissing ass than I was
[4496.50s -> 4501.70s]  Everything I got I earned the hard way just because you kept getting busted for insubordination. Oh, hey, hey
[4501.78s -> 4504.10s]  I know what you're talking about. Okay, you know, that wasn't my fault
[4504.26s -> 4509.38s]  Oh the hell it wasn't you went out of your way to disobey the orders. You never could accept ranking authority
[4509.86s -> 4511.86s]  Let me explain something to you. Okay?
[4513.14s -> 4516.66s]  If I take an order from you, it's because I choose to got it
[4516.66s -> 4523.83s]  Okay
[4524.07s -> 4526.31s]  Where the hell are you going pissed at you too?

[4608.16s -> 4612.58s]  It's great, that's just terrific
[4613.06s -> 4617.46s]  It's a little too close for comfort for me. I agree. Let's get out of here right in front of you
[4619.86s -> 4622.10s]  I really hope there's a fight, please give us a fight
[4628.13s -> 4631.46s]  All right, we're fine
[4632.58s -> 4639.41s]  Don't forget they're hurtling they're going towards the sun. Oh, that's true. Yeah
[4644.52s -> 4646.52s]  Not enough for a budget fight
[4646.60s -> 4650.87s]  Hey, are you getting a weird feeling like the hair on the back of your neck wants to stand on it?
[4651.67s -> 4652.79s]  Yeah
[4652.79s -> 4656.61s]  Kind of like we just walked into an intense electromagnetic feel

[4677.10s -> 4679.82s]  You know, you don't have to act so surprised I am
[4681.26s -> 4684.38s]  Okay, let's split up and look around Nintendo. Okay, so you take the left corridor
[4685.42s -> 4689.62s]  That's what I thought she said too, but I figured I was gonna get minus two if I said that
[4690.18s -> 4711.76s]  All right, what are we looking for? Minus two for thinking
[4712.64s -> 4720.83s]  Come on
[4720.83s -> 4722.83s]  This is an early movie game
[4723.49s -> 4724.45s]  Yeah
[4724.45s -> 4727.30s]  This is what all your favorite movie games
[4728.10s -> 4730.72s]  Are sort of based on
[4730.80s -> 4733.46s]  actor in the golden age of the 3do
[4736.58s -> 4738.58s]  early pc game
[4741.46s -> 4746.58s]  They made these all the time because graphics weren't that good the real life looked great
[4749.46s -> 4751.46s]  That's why there was a shitload of fmv games
[4754.74s -> 4756.74s]  Oh
[4761.49s -> 4768.08s]  What did she get this
[4768.08s -> 4770.32s]  What what happened to him? He didn't even touch him
[4771.94s -> 4773.94s]  And why is she about to like crack his back?
[4777.12s -> 4779.12s]  Did he pass out from fear?
[4783.90s -> 4788.78s]  Oh, he cringed so hard at that last joke, but he just he couldn't go on he passed out
[4791.39s -> 4797.01s]  One of those little flying things made an r2 d2 noise and he cringed to fucking death
[4803.07s -> 4811.65s]  Just wrap why why can't I help don't forget about me?
[4815.65s -> 4831.06s]  Oh, that's yes it is
[4834.48s -> 4840.96s]  Um, you're like you're like 25 in this video. I believe you're like less than 30 in this
[4854.91s -> 4858.24s]  38 really

[4874.88s -> 4876.40s]  You never changed
[4876.40s -> 4880.32s]  Is this like the the monologue where she describes to be the villain of the story?
[4880.96s -> 4883.82s]  Always there for us
[4883.82s -> 4890.11s]  Straight and steady and now you've changed too

[4908.02s -> 4911.02s]  It would be nice to hear your voice again
[4911.26s -> 4918.42s]  I think the med techs were working on a speech interpolation system when we pulled you from the lab. I'm sorry
[4918.42s -> 4920.42s]  We weren't such a hurry pull me from the lab
[4921.22s -> 4924.00s]  I don't know who i'm supposed to be
[4924.00s -> 4927.04s]  You know when we get out of this thing, i'm gonna find you somebody that can
[4928.86s -> 4930.86s]  Somebody that can build your voice
[4931.26s -> 4934.08s]  That's a promise
[4934.16s -> 4936.80s]  You're okay was I wait was I a robot the whole time?
[4939.60s -> 4941.60s]  I was another passenger on the ship
[4946.03s -> 4949.15s]  Oh, yeah, I was on I was another crew member, right?
[4954.82s -> 4956.82s]  Long elevator
[4968.43s -> 4978.45s]  Does that mean fourth floor ladies lingerie
[4982.93s -> 4984.93s]  Mall joke
[5001.82s -> 5003.82s]  Casey why don't you see if you can figure this thing out
[5009.98s -> 5013.02s]  See if I can figure it out. All right. Oh, no, I can't wait to not
[5013.18s -> 5020.27s]  I can't wait to get very angry in about 45 seconds. Let's analyze it. It's gonna be another ship
[5020.91s -> 5024.59s]  It's gonna be another robot communication thing and we're gonna communicate with each other
[5025.71s -> 5026.75s]  right
[5026.75s -> 5028.75s]  That would be a pretty cool twist
[5028.91s -> 5034.03s]  If I end up talking to the robot in here and I get like the story and it's not bad
[5034.43s -> 5043.01s]  The robot's just doing you know what the rope this robot's doing and i'm owned by these people whatever that'd be kind of cool
[5043.09s -> 5053.74s]  All right, I just pressed. I don't know what I just did. I got it. I opened it
[5054.46s -> 5061.10s]  It's beautiful. Yeah
[5065.10s -> 5077.63s]  Maybe some kind of sundial sure sun harry
[5079.47s -> 5083.23s]  If you're through fantasizing about me, i'd like to find a way out of here. You want to keep looking around
[5083.23s -> 5086.03s]  Why did she just nod like goes off controls?
[5086.83s -> 5093.87s]  Uh casey, why don't you keep working on this it might help it was weird
[5098.42s -> 5100.69s]  Oh shit. Okay
[5100.69s -> 5102.51s]  analyze this
[5102.51s -> 5104.59s]  um, okay press this
[5105.55s -> 5107.70s]  Okay, red
[5107.70s -> 5109.10s]  red
[5109.10s -> 5110.46s]  red
[5110.46s -> 5115.01s]  Red activate
[5117.60s -> 5120.40s]  I have to match the colors if they're in
[5122.45s -> 5126.45s]  They all have to be the same color blue everything has to be blue. No, everything has to be blue blue blue blue blue
[5127.17s -> 5132.29s]  Turn to blue everything has to be red red red red red everything has to be orange orange
[5133.89s -> 5137.22s]  Red everything wait
[5147.90s -> 5151.82s]  I have to just put the colors in the right spots, but there's no green
[5154.40s -> 5160.08s]  What color am I supposed to make this?
[5167.04s -> 5171.34s]  I don't get it either red purple make you make it purple
[5177.17s -> 5185.68s]  It's blue blue. Oh, it's all purple. I got it. Everything's purple did I win?
[5209.38s -> 5212.45s]  I don't I don't know what it wants me to do
[5212.93s -> 5214.93s]  Oh
[5218.62s -> 5224.21s]  So this is this the outside is has colors and then the inside has colors I
[5224.61s -> 5232.21s]  Okay, I get it. We need to combine whatever is in so this like, you know, for instance yellow and green makes
[5232.85s -> 5243.02s]  Blue no yellow and blue makes green right? So this is green going into here. What does
[5243.66s -> 5249.81s]  Red and yellow makes orange. Okay, so we have blue
[5250.53s -> 5255.25s]  Or I don't understand. I have no idea what this wants me to do. You're overthinking this like crazy
[5255.49s -> 5257.49s]  I don't know. I don't get it. What does it want to do?
[5270.05s -> 5275.17s]  Just match the colors to the outside. I can't do that. There's no green. There's no green
[5284.46s -> 5289.71s]  There's no green and there's no blue
[5291.57s -> 5293.57s]  And match the other ones
[5295.01s -> 5296.91s]  All right, so I did
[5296.91s -> 5298.91s]  They already are done. There's no orange
[5300.03s -> 5302.83s]  This is I already did it. I've matched it. What about the manual?
[5308.45s -> 5310.93s]  clicking on the outer ring of the hemisphere
[5315.02s -> 5318.26s]  Oh, never mind. I thought I had it clicking on the
[5319.06s -> 5321.06s]  outer ring of the
[5321.22s -> 5328.69s]  Clicking on the outer ring of the hemispheres causes two of them to change colors
[5329.01s -> 5335.33s]  The goal is to change all of the hemispheres to yellow. Okay, great that I would never have known that I had to make them all yellow
[5336.77s -> 5340.35s]  I made them all purple
[5355.30s -> 5362.80s]  Like how was I supposed to know that all of them had to be yellow I made them all purple
[5372.24s -> 5377.82s]  We have to drive this thing. Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here. Don't you?
[5378.80s -> 5382.14s]  Yeah, okay. Let's meet up and move out. Yeah
[5384.06s -> 5385.02s]  Yeah
[5388.16s -> 5391.98s]  Wait, wait, wait, you hear that it's in there
[5395.07s -> 5400.18s]  It's the cringe yep
[5421.54s -> 5423.54s]  You killed him
[5427.89s -> 5429.89s]  Oh, no
[5430.45s -> 5433.73s]  I don't think that's the first time they've given me an opportunity to shoot anything
[5435.26s -> 5437.74s]  All right. I need to shoot her shoot her next
[5440.00s -> 5440.96s]  Ah
[5440.96s -> 5443.52s]  Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here. Don't you?
[5444.48s -> 5446.34s]  Yeah
[5446.34s -> 5450.66s]  Look, do you really expect the robot that takes 40 minutes to complete a children's
[5451.30s -> 5454.58s]  Match puzzle to be able to aim a weapon correctly
[5458.86s -> 5462.06s]  You killed him. That was more funny to me than anything else
[5463.38s -> 5466.50s]  Look right in the camera right in my eyes. You killed him
[5476.18s -> 5478.18s]  He's shooting he tried he's killed me
[5479.36s -> 5484.64s]  His last ditch effort was i'm gonna kill this motherfucker. He got it. He got his final thing his final wish
[5486.82s -> 5491.54s]  What a way to end that I kill her he gets stabbed through the throat and then kills me
[5492.42s -> 5494.42s]  This is this is a tarantino movie
[5495.06s -> 5505.47s]  Listen, I think we've done enough. Don't you?
[5506.13s -> 5509.10s]  Yeah, okay. Let's meet up and move out
[5510.24s -> 5512.00s]  You killed him
[5512.00s -> 5521.66s]  Wait, wait, wait, you hear that coming from the bodies
[5522.14s -> 5524.14s]  So I have to shoot the aliens that come out
[5524.78s -> 5530.80s]  Here we go
[5530.80s -> 5541.34s]  This is so lame. This is what you look like when you play vr
[5544.83s -> 5546.19s]  They're everywhere
[5546.19s -> 5556.29s]  I got one. What was he doing?
[5557.01s -> 5560.45s]  Oh, wait, what is he doing? He shoots behind his head like three times
[5564.46s -> 5566.46s]  He's aiming at the ground
[5567.74s -> 5571.33s]  So
[5601.70s -> 5606.74s]  You know what you can't blame them for that either though like these actors they're in front of a green screen
[5606.74s -> 5608.18s]  They have no idea
[5608.18s -> 5610.18s]  There's somebody right there going and
[5611.14s -> 5615.22s]  Action shoot all around you shoot shoot shoot look out behind you behind you behind you get that one
[5615.22s -> 5619.70s]  Get one duck duck duck duck. They're everywhere. They're everywhere. They're on the ground. They're everywhere
[5619.78s -> 5621.38s]  There's one crawling on you
[5621.38s -> 5626.34s]  And then the effects artist has to take all this thing that the director told them to do and be like I
[5626.66s -> 5629.07s]  What am I supposed to do with this shit?
[5629.07s -> 5631.63s]  They're supposed to be flying around the ship. They're not supposed to be on the ground
[5637.25s -> 5639.89s]  You can't blame the actress they're doing they're doing their best
[5640.53s -> 5651.86s]  For all things considered they are
[5651.86s -> 5656.54s]  Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here. Don't you they're doing their best for porn actors
[5657.90s -> 5659.90s]  Tia what's her name?
[5661.34s -> 5662.54s]  Tia
[5662.54s -> 5663.92s]  What's her name?
[5663.92s -> 5665.92s]  She was famous actress
[5667.34s -> 5669.34s]  Tia carrera tia carrera

[5682.00s -> 5684.00s]  Shit, oh shit
[5685.44s -> 5688.64s]  What does this game have for a rating?
[5692.78s -> 5698.10s]  Shit you say shit the t game
[5698.90s -> 5702.67s]  Did you just grab one off her shoulder?
[5710.56s -> 5722.58s]  All right, there's how many how many what do we have to do? How long is this?
[5727.95s -> 5729.95s]  I want one of them to stub their toe on something
[5730.27s -> 5735.07s]  Just look at somebody that's been in front of a green screen doing this exact thing this exact thing
[5735.79s -> 5737.79s]  It's fucking tiring and it's painful
[5742.46s -> 5744.46s]  In fact, I hope somebody puts me in this scene
[5749.86s -> 5751.86s]  Now they are they are they syrup?
[5752.58s -> 5756.70s]  What am I doing? What do I do?
[5758.94s -> 5765.92s]  I have to save one of them
[5765.92s -> 5767.44s]  Extend the hand
[5767.44s -> 5768.80s]  Turn the thrusters off
[5768.80s -> 5770.72s]  analyze
[5770.72s -> 5773.47s]  data
[5773.47s -> 5786.08s]  Wait, did I just hit my head?
[5786.08s -> 5790.40s]  In a panic I ran around and scoopy do shaggy somehow
[5790.88s -> 5792.16s]  Saved the day
[5792.16s -> 5808.18s]  What do you want me to do analyze the damage? Jesus christ. What is this?
[5808.66s -> 5815.36s]  Okay, this connects
[5815.44s -> 5819.09s]  Connect them connect all of them
[5828.75s -> 5833.94s]  Shit, okay. They have their color coded. This is yellow when I press the okay
[5834.34s -> 5839.57s]  So that yellow is gonna make all the ones that are yellow move red is gonna make the ones that are red move
[5841.44s -> 5854.59s]  Blue is gonna make all the ones that are blue move. I just did it. Damn it. I didn't hold on. I did it
[5854.59s -> 5861.84s]  That's it. No, what that's not what that is
[5865.52s -> 5874.11s]  But some have two colors. Yeah. Yeah, but okay when I press this yellow one ready watch
[5874.51s -> 5882.75s]  You would assume that all the ones that have a yellow square are the ones that open or close, right? Okay, so then
[5883.47s -> 5889.87s]  With this theory it's done. These are the only two yellows, right?
[5890.98s -> 5897.44s]  For this one here. Okay. Now we need to do this one and then we have to have one that's ripped to do a red
[5898.42s -> 5905.79s]  Now it's it's done. I did it. Wait. No, I didn't. Hold on. Wait. Hold on
[5906.35s -> 5918.45s]  Shit, but we'll open. Okay. This will open. I need to okay
[5919.41s -> 5949.82s]  Open the yellows and then close all the blues and yellows shit red or blue. God damn it
[5950.06s -> 5956.67s]  I think that's it. Did I do it? No
[5957.71s -> 5964.94s]  Stupid blue the stupid blue one. I had to press this one
[5976.62s -> 5978.06s]  Now that's it
[5978.06s -> 5989.28s]  Right. Hold on. I need to do so red red will this will close all the reds and the yellows. This is open
[5989.52s -> 6021.60s]  Why why does this one have to be open? All right, wait, wait, wait blue and yellow you stupid motherfucker
[6026.46s -> 6028.46s]  It doesn't help that it's wicked ugly, too
[6028.54s -> 6049.25s]  It's this the ones that the doubles the doubles would just fuck everything up blue and red blue blue and red
[6050.40s -> 6063.92s]  That's it. No, it's not god damn it press the one red one and then the yellow blue one
[6076.85s -> 6079.73s]  This is the kind of ipad game that I download sometimes
[6080.13s -> 6084.93s]  I play the first three levels and I go nope and I hold my thumb on the icon and I delete the app
[6085.25s -> 6098.80s]  So why even have the greens here? They don't do anything. It's all this yellow blue red shit
[6099.97s -> 6105.15s]  Now if I do this one, it'll close all the yellow ones. I don't want to do that. I want to
[6106.03s -> 6111.70s]  do um, um a
[6112.18s -> 6135.02s]  uh, and then um, I don't even I don't even care a puzzle. I don't do puzzles. I've run wicked fast
[6135.26s -> 6144.00s]  You know what I mean? Like that's that's not what I do. I don't care. Hit the blue one. No. Oh I did
[6165.22s -> 6168.26s]  You gave up at the finish line looks like everything's up and running again
[6168.82s -> 6171.62s]  It's a good thing too because we need you to open another door
[6173.26s -> 6174.70s]  Go to it case
[6174.70s -> 6176.72s]  What?
[6176.72s -> 6180.80s]  I've repaired myself for them to make me open a new door with another puzzle
[6183.31s -> 6185.31s]  Is that all i'm worth to you guys?
[6185.39s -> 6199.33s]  I just saved both of your lives twice. Remember when you got sucked out of the window and I had to come to your rescue
[6200.05s -> 6201.50s]  remember when
[6201.50s -> 6205.98s]  You were being swarmed by aliens and I shot all of them. Not one of you
[6207.42s -> 6208.94s]  Got one kill
[6208.94s -> 6228.08s]  Okay, so put it up. Please insert disc three
[6229.12s -> 6231.12s]  This one is gonna be hell. I can already tell
[6232.96s -> 6237.28s]  We're already at disc three. We're this we're gonna beat this game. I think I think we're actually gonna beat this game
[6245.94s -> 6248.18s]  And for all for all the the naysayers in here
[6248.74s -> 6250.66s]  um
[6250.66s -> 6255.06s]  If I have a sort of a gauge of how I gauge if i'm going to complete a video game or not
[6255.38s -> 6257.38s]  If you get to disc three out of four
[6258.78s -> 6260.82s]  Just do the whole thing
[6260.82s -> 6273.06s]  It's probably like another 40 minutes in this damn game. That's not sunk cost. That's I want to see the end
[6281.44s -> 6291.79s]  Virgin interactive. What about it? All right. What am I trying to make here?
[6296.88s -> 6299.28s]  Uh, am I supposed to fill the whole thing in a certain color?
[6300.85s -> 6307.95s]  What does the manual say manual says?
[6308.51s -> 6316.93s]  Well, this would be the uh, the blue door, right? Okay
[6317.17s -> 6322.53s]  When you rotate the outer hexagons by clicking on them, the corresponding shape is also rotated in the center hexagon
[6323.01s -> 6328.13s]  If any of the colored shapes intersect in the center hexagon the overlapping triangles turn gray
[6328.53s -> 6333.09s]  The goal is to rotate the shapes so that there are no gray triangles in the center
[6335.34s -> 6364.80s]  Easy, this is not going to be easy. All right, that one fits up there. Wait, that one fits in there. That's right there
[6365.12s -> 6368.38s]  All right. We got something wrong here
[6368.38s -> 6372.80s]  Something wrong here. It's this guy
[6374.53s -> 6386.45s]  Get it. I what there's more. Oh dear. No, no, no, no, no, no, there's gonna be three of these. Yeah
[6387.57s -> 6404.26s]  No, I don't want to do this. Okay, there's everyone. Where can I fit you? Wait, wait, okay, that's good
[6407.90s -> 6416.11s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, is it the green go to this orange?
[6418.32s -> 6420.80s]  Orange you gotta go this way
[6420.80s -> 6428.94s]  No, no
[6428.94s -> 6429.74s]  No
[6429.74s -> 6443.01s]  No, it's wrong. Yellow absolutely goes right here. Red is absolutely right there pink. Oh pink is absolutely not over there
[6444.56s -> 6451.81s]  Or is it it might be? Oh, yeah pink is absolutely over there. Okay. What about over here? Wait, absolutely
[6460.88s -> 6472.61s]  What goes here though? Nothing fits in that spot right there. Does anything go there?
[6474.83s -> 6488.13s]  That does but what else can go there? Okay. Wait, that is I think that's the only solution there yellow you moron
[6488.77s -> 6491.94s]  All right. Hey the next time you're doing like a sudoku
[6491.94s -> 6496.74s]  I'm gonna stand over your shoulder and when you when you do one wrong and you like erase it with your pencil
[6496.74s -> 6502.18s]  I'm gonna go like you idiot. You're stupid and you're gonna go fucking around with my puzzle man
[6502.18s -> 6506.83s]  Leave me alone then i'm gonna drink the rest of the coffee that's on the pot
[6507.66s -> 6513.26s]  And fucking walk like upstairs and then you're gonna go for a coffee like around two second coffee. I'm gonna be fucking furious
[6513.26s -> 6560.08s]  That's enough left. I did it. I drank it. All right. Hold on. What's this? No, this is right. That's okay
[6561.46s -> 6563.38s]  What should red be down here?
[6563.38s -> 6568.40s]  No, red's right
[6568.40s -> 6571.12s]  Blue is not right
[6571.12s -> 6572.72s]  Yellow's not right either
[6572.80s -> 6584.51s]  Hold on. I don't know orange and green orange and green orange and green orange and green
[6585.15s -> 6587.71s]  Yeah, that makes sense
[6587.71s -> 6591.97s]  That makes sense. But what's taking up this spot over here?
[6593.26s -> 6595.26s]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[6597.31s -> 6599.65s]  That's
[6599.65s -> 6601.81s]  I didn't fill one in
[6601.81s -> 6606.56s]  What's that little space right there? I didn't fill in I was trying to fill that in
[6608.70s -> 6612.83s]  Casey
[6612.83s -> 6618.11s]  I guess you need to leave one spot. This is amazing. Look at the size of it
[6619.23s -> 6621.23s]  Harry can't even see the bottom here
[6624.58s -> 6626.58s]  More monkey noises now. All right fine
[6637.09s -> 6648.74s]  Did you just try to grab his gun
[6651.86s -> 6655.06s]  You both almost died twice this is not a place to fuck around
[6656.58s -> 6657.86s]  like
[6657.86s -> 6659.78s]  He's spitting on me
[6659.78s -> 6671.31s]  But am I not allowed to hang out on the platform with them?
[6671.95s -> 6685.57s]  Die now let's encounter
[6686.93s -> 6689.87s]  The bones
[6701.30s -> 6704.51s]  50 chat message trying to help the stream and all he does is call us morons
[6704.51s -> 6709.31s]  All he struggles finish the simpleton puzzle. You know, the streamer is the moron. He's being mean to us. I'm not seven
[6710.83s -> 6713.14s]  Give me back this ship isn't that big
[6713.70s -> 6716.45s]  It's gotta be a projection
[6716.45s -> 6718.74s]  Or an illusion
[6718.74s -> 6720.74s]  Hey, hey, wait, maybe that
[6720.74s -> 6723.70s]  Yeah, see you tomorrow feel we went through before somehow, you know
[6724.56s -> 6726.56s]  Transported us to the home world
[6727.44s -> 6728.74s]  Transported
[6728.74s -> 6729.94s]  Yeah
[6730.88s -> 6736.10s]  Why can we breathe out here star trek reruns what happened to the space suits
[6742.05s -> 6744.13s]  Fresh air there's even a breeze
[6744.85s -> 6748.75s]  This is an illusion. It's pretty damn convincing
[6749.23s -> 6752.75s]  It's actually kind of funny if they found a little door over here and they opened it and it was like a big set
[6753.71s -> 6755.71s]  Cameras and stuff and they were like, oh shit
[6756.19s -> 6758.27s]  Closed it is real. Yeah, I guess we are all right here
[6765.79s -> 6767.79s]  It wasn't real it was a mirage
[6768.67s -> 6770.67s]  It was fake
[6772.53s -> 6774.53s]  Don't put your face that close
[6794.05s -> 6797.97s]  You had to do make like the jokes and make the condescending remarks and now he's dead
[6810.86s -> 6826.37s]  What I let go of him when did I let go of him I didn't press anything I didn't I I didn't
[6827.01s -> 6829.01s]  Jesus christ, I didn't press anything
[6829.57s -> 6836.62s]  He grasped me. He says, oh, thank god. I love you. And then I what do I do? He didn't give me a prompter
[6841.18s -> 6842.78s]  thrusters
[6842.78s -> 6852.38s]  All right thruster press. Yes
[6858.14s -> 6859.57s]  No
[6859.57s -> 6861.57s]  What is this is thruster, right?
[6863.52s -> 6865.52s]  This is thruster right here, right?
[6869.06s -> 6872.90s]  This is thruster. Let's go
[6873.22s -> 6879.86s]  Well, look this has like the lines on it. That's the thrust line
[6880.86s -> 6883.26s]  What should I do something and have to dodge anything?
[6892.18s -> 6898.64s]  Uh, I think we're just going
[6915.34s -> 6922.35s]  Wouldn't he have fallen? Oh, okay. No. Yeah, he would have he would have just fallen right through isn't the ground here
[6933.10s -> 6935.34s]  Child a child
[6960.24s -> 6961.76s]  Is this the
[6962.32s -> 6969.36s]  You rented like the 45 minute hour like that. It's not even an hour and 30 minutes. It's like 48 minute long porn movie
[6971.04s -> 6975.44s]  And they just do this the entire movie until the last 12 minutes
[6981.89s -> 6986.23s]  And all of you just fast forward to the last 12 minutes
[6999.09s -> 7001.09s]  You're speaking from experience
[7004.72s -> 7007.52s]  Yes
[7007.52s -> 7010.48s]  No, i've never seen a pornographic film in my entire life
[7012.53s -> 7018.85s]  That's disgusting to me what you just said, how dare you ever even assume that i've seen one of these just disgusting
[7018.99s -> 7020.99s]  revolting pornographic films
[7022.78s -> 7028.83s]  Oh, I drink water and I do my uh chores, you know, are there anything else?
[7029.47s -> 7044.30s]  I'm glad that let's take a look around. Yeah. Yeah, I can manage that remember this time. I know I know I know be careful
[7045.02s -> 7047.02s]  Doesn't do taxes. He just admitted it
[7048.27s -> 7050.27s]  What how do you where do you get that from?
[7060.00s -> 7062.00s]  Chores is watch porn
[7067.20s -> 7076.19s]  Sometimes it feels like that. Don't it? What is this?
[7089.34s -> 7090.38s]  like
[7090.38s -> 7095.18s]  All right, what's today? Today's uh, thursday. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I did I got the mail
[7096.14s -> 7101.44s]  That's yeah, I did I didn't work I just got back from work, I guess yeah, I got the mail I washed the windows
[7103.52s -> 7105.52s]  I jumped I guess time to do this
[7114.22s -> 7116.22s]  I'm not tired yet. What time is it?
[7116.70s -> 7118.70s]  Oh, it's like it's like 8 30
[7119.42s -> 7122.37s]  I'm not gonna fall asleep for like another six hours or so probably
[7123.25s -> 7125.25s]  Wow, thank you. I mean, I mean I guess
[7136.53s -> 7140.21s]  I
[7140.21s -> 7142.21s]  Stop talking
[7143.41s -> 7149.25s]  I can't wait. I can joke and make fuck around about like everything else but not about like be careful
[7149.57s -> 7151.17s]  Don't talk about this
[7151.17s -> 7156.86s]  it's the one thing that's off limits besides politics and that's even bullshit because you've heard me do like
[7157.50s -> 7172.03s]  Every politician's voice you've heard on this stream. Yeah. All right. This is a crystal puzzle. I know this one
[7174.58s -> 7177.71s]  Your son is watching
[7177.79s -> 7182.75s]  Is do you know this is a you had to click the yes, I mature audience filter it's on
[7183.74s -> 7188.77s]  You had to press that button
[7188.77s -> 7192.96s]  Uh, am I doing I think i'm doing this right somehow accidentally
[7198.05s -> 7218.77s]  Let's do it. Um
[7220.42s -> 7226.62s]  Solve this puzzle. You must freeze the objects in pairs of matching silhouettes causing them to become highlighted
[7227.02s -> 7238.98s]  When all the objects are highlighted the lock will open in pairs of matching silhouettes feel like triangle triangle
[7242.69s -> 7256.99s]  diamond diamond
[7256.99s -> 7264.35s]  Uh, please need to stop watching it's been an issue for quite a while
[7264.35s -> 7267.87s]  We're aware of it, but you keep watching this sort of material on stream. I'm gonna have no choice
[7267.87s -> 7271.15s]  But to unsubscribe what what you what why am I watching this on stream?
[7278.86s -> 7280.70s]  All right, is it pac-man?
[7280.70s -> 7296.19s]  No, it's not pac-man. What is it then circle you to match the silhouette. It's the shape
[7296.91s -> 7305.18s]  Yeah, okay. Hold on. Can I get a little tab in the middle there? Is that even I think this even does that
[7306.83s -> 7316.91s]  Moon little half moon. Not really. Oh, it's not just shape not color
[7318.51s -> 7320.51s]  Ah
[7320.83s -> 7330.29s]  Okay, i'm gonna find the star
[7330.37s -> 7345.39s]  Where's there a star or not a star maybe something else maybe a cube. I got this one right here. Check it out
[7350.80s -> 7355.57s]  Yep. Oh, what about this cube?
[7356.35s -> 7368.62s]  Oh, that's a star. It could also be a cube. It could also be a star. No, I can't
[7369.76s -> 7379.15s]  No
[7379.15s -> 7381.15s]  Wait, that's the only one that's been matched so far
[7381.95s -> 7387.84s]  shit
[7387.84s -> 7390.70s]  No
[7390.70s -> 7392.61s]  No, dude
[7392.61s -> 7404.72s]  I can't get it right. How is that not the same? It has to be the exact same thing
[7407.46s -> 7414.94s]  Oh god same deal with this one. Okay
[7416.70s -> 7420.05s]  Whack and then
[7420.05s -> 7429.84s]  Whack did I win? Oh, you don't have to you only have to do it for three of them. No, dude
[7434.16s -> 7443.57s]  Was that an alien talking or did they have to record somebody that was in the sound room and not the actor
[7443.89s -> 7448.58s]  Because they needed something there. Yeah, that's what it was
[7448.82s -> 7452.50s]  I think maybe on these guys, uh planet one of the audio engineers had to do that
[7462.18s -> 7464.18s]  About eating these aliens
[7468.06s -> 7473.41s]  Have some respect why because they're dead this guy is a genuine asshole
[7488.74s -> 7492.90s]  We don't have a song
[7493.54s -> 7497.90s]  If there is a nav console and all this stuff we'd have to tear this place apart to find it
[7498.38s -> 7500.38s]  Assuming we'll even know it when we see it
[7501.18s -> 7503.90s]  I think we shouldn't take a look around. I think you should die dallas
[7506.56s -> 7508.88s]  Let us know if you spot anything casey. I will
[7509.76s -> 7512.21s]  Thanks for including me by the way
[7512.21s -> 7515.90s]  I know you don't have to
[7515.90s -> 7519.36s]  Well, unless you're having better luck than I am. I think we should keep going didn't even
[7521.54s -> 7530.06s]  I didn't get one second. That's all the time you're gonna give me here
[7530.54s -> 7535.22s]  I'll say one thing about those crin. He sure as hell do a thorough job
[7535.62s -> 7541.38s]  That room must have been I think we'll ever find any of these guys like a 10 by 10 cube. I sure hope so
[7542.34s -> 7544.10s]  You know, it's times like this
[7544.10s -> 7547.30s]  I wish I just stayed home and went to business school just like mama wanted
[7547.94s -> 7554.26s]  This looks the same in 160 that doesn't 1080. I'm sure it does. Well, it just so happens
[7554.26s -> 7556.74s]  I have a pretty good head for figures. I can't add
[7557.54s -> 7560.02s]  Uh information for the bitrate to take
[7565.86s -> 7569.31s]  Puzzle door
[7569.31s -> 7571.31s]  All I can do is upscale this
[7571.55s -> 7574.51s]  I can't add data to what's being presented
[7580.26s -> 7581.79s]  orange red
[7581.79s -> 7583.79s]  green blue
[7583.87s -> 7587.52s]  Does this even count as a video game?
[7588.83s -> 7590.83s]  Well, I mean it depends
[7591.28s -> 7593.28s]  Does the back of your cereal box?
[7595.04s -> 7604.90s]  Consider itself to be a video game. I mean, it's a game
[7605.54s -> 7608.61s]  But I mean it is this is on video
[7610.29s -> 7613.09s]  So yes, it is technically let's take a look where this one is
[7616.80s -> 7618.77s]  Okay
[7618.77s -> 7623.73s]  The objective is to route a colored light so that it reaches the flashing point of the same color
[7624.59s -> 7628.90s]  Okay, you can deflect the path of light by clicking in the cells
[7630.37s -> 7636.99s]  It is all right for the colors to mix at the position where they hit the flashing points from blue to blue
[7637.63s -> 7644.82s]  That's not cheating. This is how it's what I've known what to do. Wait, what's this like goo? I'm putting on it
[7651.71s -> 7654.08s]  Oh, no, that's a mirrors
[7654.08s -> 7663.25s]  Oh, dear. These are mirrors. Oh fucking Jesus. This is gonna be hell. This is gonna be horrible
[7666.43s -> 7673.55s]  Uh, take this off. It's gotta be here. These all get to get all these mirrors off
[7674.11s -> 7684.53s]  Take all these mirrors off. All right, we're gonna go this way take that mirror off. Get this one off this way
[7685.25s -> 7700.02s]  We're gonna bounce it from here to here get that mirror off. That one's done. Now. We need green green
[7700.26s -> 7707.62s]  Where's green as a oh, okay green so green is gonna go
[7708.56s -> 7718.74s]  Down here. We need to have a touch down here. No, how do I erase?
[7719.30s -> 7731.39s]  Erase erase erase erase erase erase erase. Okay down and then right here. We're gonna bend it this way
[7733.44s -> 7749.62s]  I don't know. I don't know. Oh jesus. Okay. No, it's got wait odd watchers. Do your taxes
[7753.07s -> 7773.17s]  I mean you could if you wanted to this goes this way. We need to bounce it to here. There it is
[7774.02s -> 7787.30s]  Okay, so that's that now. We just need red shit. Yeah
[7788.34s -> 7793.41s]  We do it again red to red blue to blue
[7795.02s -> 7813.14s]  Uh blue is already blue is already there one so I have to hit green has to wait. What the hell's going on green is
[7813.86s -> 7821.90s]  Already there red and then red and then red and then red
[7822.46s -> 7826.11s]  It red and then uh
[7830.88s -> 7841.38s]  Shit, this is gonna get ugly. This is gonna get really gonna get this is gonna get ugly
[7848.78s -> 7851.26s]  Okay, blue is already blue
[7859.14s -> 7868.35s]  Shit shit. I'm blue watching this
[7869.15s -> 7871.23s]  ha ha ha
[7871.23s -> 7875.31s]  Flashlight in the top right. Oh, that's not what you said
[7875.95s -> 7888.45s]  You said something else. All right blue blue now. We need green to green green green
[7889.23s -> 7907.33s]  That's it. That's it. I gotta gotta see red right here. Shit. It's so close. That's it. How's that? No, it is
[7908.05s -> 7936.19s]  Blue needs to go up here. This is very bad
[7967.23s -> 7970.99s]  Delete everything delete delete delete delete delete it all delete it all delete delete delete delete delete delete get it
[7971.07s -> 7982.90s]  I this this too many fucking mirrors. There's mirrors everywhere. Okay, I did it. All right. That was there's another one cool
[7983.14s -> 7988.00s]  um not cool, um
[7988.00s -> 8006.93s]  Blue is blue blue's gotta go over here blue going up and no I don't want to do this one
[8007.17s -> 8010.30s]  I don't want to do this one. I really don't want to do this one
[8010.54s -> 8028.34s]  I I have to you said you would finish the game of who said I was gonna stop playing the game
[8030.11s -> 8040.48s]  I was just gonna go to the walkthrough and wait the walkthrough is on easy like dallas encounter walkthrough medium
[8046.46s -> 8055.66s]  All right. I'm almost there almost at the almost at the end of the game. All right, here we go
[8055.90s -> 8073.10s]  This is the one i'm on right now. I'm just gonna follow it word for word. Okay. Hold on. Hold on
[8073.34s -> 8076.64s]  I'm just gonna follow word. Wait, this is not right blue green
[8077.28s -> 8090.00s]  Right. This one's not right. Why is this different than mine blue on the left blue on the top?
[8090.00s -> 8107.04s]  This is different than mine. God fucking damn it. I I can't change the difficulty and I it's randomized
[8111.15s -> 8114.27s]  Why do you have to have to be randomized? All right, I have to that means I have to just do it
[8114.35s -> 8126.82s]  That means I have to do it. Here we go step by step. That's one one is done green green is gonna go
[8127.30s -> 8133.81s]  From here to here and then from here to here. Nope one more down one more down
[8135.15s -> 8144.22s]  Green is done. No, it's not now. It will be this is not good. Wait, hold on
[8151.52s -> 8157.20s]  69 69 viewers watching. Okay
[8157.92s -> 8162.40s]  That's kind of cool. I guess they have to I gotta go down here for this one, too
[8162.88s -> 8166.56s]  Why did I make this medium? Why didn't I just put it on easy? Who cares?
[8170.94s -> 8181.36s]  It's my own damn fault. Oh Jesus. I i'm just gonna try
[8182.34s -> 8191.06s]  It's gonna be really sloppy, but it might work green blue needs to go
[8192.32s -> 8198.98s]  Wait, why is this this is red now? What the fuck happened? That one's done. There's any there's another red right here
[8199.54s -> 8211.57s]  Get rid of everything. We're doing red first. Okay green
[8214.48s -> 8225.41s]  There's only one green on the right so we go bounce bounce bounce done. Okay, red is done
[8225.98s -> 8248.43s]  There is no more red except for down here. Okay, red is done. It's now time to move on to green green
[8248.83s -> 8253.60s]  Where's the other green over here?
[8253.76s -> 8274.58s]  Oh shit what how am I supposed to get that how am I supposed to get that one colors can mix at the ends
[8275.94s -> 8284.19s]  Uh, this has to be
[8284.43s -> 8291.60s]  Blue somehow need to go back to the fourth grade
[8292.16s -> 8292.96s]  No
[8292.96s -> 8297.84s]  This put this is fucking like difficult and annoying. All right, i'm not gonna sit here and take that
[8298.48s -> 8323.41s]  This is like an annoying shit puzzle blue blue. Oh, hold on almost there. I got it. I'm gonna get it right now ready
[8325.36s -> 8332.53s]  Oh, hold on. Yes
[8333.95s -> 8348.14s]  Does that count does it count this is a mess. No, it doesn't I thought you said I could complete I could combine them
[8361.22s -> 8363.52s]  Such a fucking mess
[8363.52s -> 8380.18s]  There has to be a medium walkthrough. Okay, but I found one. Oh, this is only the first 20 minutes of the game
[8380.50s -> 8386.51s]  You can do this. I believe in you. I don't think I can I I think i'm too impatient to even spend 10 minutes on this
[8387.14s -> 8398.29s]  I can't do click map. See look at how many spaces there are. What did I what did I go wrong? I did
[8398.69s -> 8405.06s]  I did I have no idea play something else. I'm almost on disc four. I can't all right
[8405.06s -> 8422.38s]  What if I can I change it to easy sunk cost?
[8423.41s -> 8425.41s]  It's like so stupid
[8426.83s -> 8427.79s]  Oh
[8427.79s -> 8429.79s]  I'm so pissed
[8432.93s -> 8446.29s]  Get me out. What happened?
[8446.37s -> 8448.37s]  Medium no, no
[8455.17s -> 8458.56s]  No
[8458.56s -> 8460.88s]  Jump to scene 24 on easy
[8467.54s -> 8470.16s]  It's too mean
[8470.48s -> 8471.76s]  Easy
[8471.76s -> 8473.76s]  scene 24
[8474.32s -> 8478.27s]  Let's go
[8478.27s -> 8482.83s]  No, I don't want to change the game. I want to see what happens in the end. I'm i'm on disc of four
[8483.31s -> 8499.65s]  Wait, I still have to actually do this. It's supposed to be easy
[8500.21s -> 8521.38s]  Hold on. I think this person was playing on easy. Yeah, they were all right. This person was playing on easy
[8521.38s -> 8550.77s]  I got it. Okay, so then it goes like this. Okay, there's this blue blue blue blue blue blue red red
[8551.54s -> 8563.95s]  Green green red red like it's it's hard to even tell where the mirrors are because this thing is at like fucking 200p
[8564.27s -> 8580.72s]  We don't have to do anymore. We're done. That's it
[8593.15s -> 8597.79s]  Thing what what were you thinking about? I was deciding what to call the ship when I read it up in the log
[8598.11s -> 8600.27s]  Man, what's that? Hellhive crin motel?
[8600.91s -> 8602.91s]  Deadless what?
[8602.91s -> 8607.63s]  Ancient great mythology to escape from the labyrinth deadless made wings out of feathers and wax
[8608.11s -> 8610.83s]  And then you fly too close to the sun and squirt his ass
[8611.79s -> 8613.79s]  Marlon brando
[8616.43s -> 8618.96s]  It kind of is
[8618.96s -> 8621.25s]  Yeah, the dead listen kind of
[8621.25s -> 8623.73s]  Hey to find a way out of here, i'ma leave
[8625.09s -> 8631.98s]  In plant life, I guess
[8632.06s -> 8633.66s]  Yeah, but for what?
[8633.66s -> 8638.54s]  food supply oxygen supply frump and marlon brando are yes, they are one step away from each other
[8642.61s -> 8645.68s]  Fogs
[8650.50s -> 8655.62s]  It's like no don't shoot me she shot it around this thing maybe you can figure out a way to open it from the other side
[8657.01s -> 8659.33s]  The hell was that with the gun pulling thing?
[8659.57s -> 8661.57s]  I'm sorry
[8661.65s -> 8663.65s]  Dude, she's sus
[8667.46s -> 8671.30s]  Don't you love on my stream when is he streaming command is not ruined forever
[8671.94s -> 8694.67s]  That's supposed to be sense danger in sorcery. And now it's like hey i'm sus as to when he's streaming found something
[8695.07s -> 8700.56s]  Here comes a puzzle. I can't wait to do it very very quickly
[8701.28s -> 8716.61s]  It's all an easy
[8716.61s -> 8720.90s]  Me like what was it in in?
[8721.14s -> 8725.78s]  Well, isn't sus short for like suspect like you suspect somebody
[8732.22s -> 8735.49s]  Yeah, it's I mean in
[8735.73s -> 8742.48s]  Sorcery the spell was sense danger not like you are suspicious
[8743.04s -> 8757.26s]  Sort of the same. It's a little it's a little the same not completely the same though
[8764.80s -> 8775.87s]  Um, how deep does this go at what point do I lose walkie talkie frequency?
[8777.09s -> 8783.86s]  Uh, look down should look down there's something down here. Oh, no, it's a maze
[8785.58s -> 8793.62s]  Of course it is
[8793.62s -> 8798.64s]  Okay. So now we're gonna go
[8799.36s -> 8811.49s]  Maybe should I maybe analyze should I analyze the area analyze?
[8812.29s -> 8818.42s]  Data analyze thrusters. No, I just have to get it right
[8818.98s -> 8829.20s]  I just have to guess this is your colonoscopy. Yeah, pretty similar
[8833.58s -> 8847.78s]  Except it'd be kind of weird to have multiple ways to go in your intestines found it lucky there. Wait, I didn't really
[8848.02s -> 8857.81s]  This is no good. This is no good
[8860.13s -> 8865.14s]  I got to start keeping track of where i've been but I have no idea where i've been every hallway is the same
[8865.46s -> 8874.94s]  Can't go up or down, right? I need a pen and paper
[8875.50s -> 8881.06s]  That's not a bad idea wall
[8881.14s -> 8904.96s]  All right, should I get out the pen and paper? I can't look up and I can't look down just use microsoft paint
[8905.28s -> 8907.28s]  So what i'm back? Okay. Wait, wait, wait
[8907.36s -> 8912.64s]  Okay, i'm gonna do paint. It's probably helpful. So that's a wall
[8913.28s -> 8923.97s]  There's paint shit. It's on the monitor behind me. God damn it. I can't even click it
[8923.97s -> 8931.76s]  It's on the monitor behind me like behind the like i'm on a different source right now
[8932.32s -> 8938.00s]  Not behind me. I mean like behind the game. I'm on a different source about hdmi. I'm not on dvi because i'm capping it
[8950.08s -> 8952.08s]  Shh follow the right wall
[8952.64s -> 8956.08s]  I just tried to all right jeff. I'm gonna follow the right wall
[8962.24s -> 8966.38s]  Follow right wall. Okay, i'm going
[8968.70s -> 8995.04s]  Wait wouldn't going right again put me in a circle. Okay, right again s video scaler hdmi. That's the one I have a retro tink
[8995.82s -> 8997.82s]  so it's s video into the retro tink and then
[8998.54s -> 9006.98s]  hdmi from the retro tink into an el gato and then el gato into the tv or the monitor i'm hugging the right wall
[9010.18s -> 9012.18s]  By the way, the retro tink is incredible
[9012.18s -> 9015.30s]  If you have an old console, it's the best one i've used so far
[9017.97s -> 9030.59s]  Without a doubt. I'm gonna try going this way the maze has pillars. You're fucked with the right wall
[9031.62s -> 9048.05s]  I didn't how does it even end up there? I'd rather watch you clean the bathroom than this
[9050.53s -> 9053.89s]  Just wait a minute. I'm i'm interested. I need to play
[9054.69s -> 9058.37s]  This game sucks. All right, I know you don't think I know I need i'm
[9059.54s -> 9062.42s]  I'm enjoying it. I'm wonderful. I gotta get to disc four
[9062.50s -> 9071.89s]  I can't just not see disc four. Otherwise, that's so bad for me. All right. Hold on. Does this guy have the walkthrough of this?
[9072.45s -> 9092.82s]  Where is it? Come on. Show me. All right. Here he is. Okay, so he goes
[9094.21s -> 9097.41s]  straight
[9097.41s -> 9105.06s]  Straight, how would you even figure this out straight right ends up going down somehow actually physically down
[9105.22s -> 9117.49s]  How much of this game add to the germ of debt take no. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. I went down
[9117.49s -> 9122.32s]  I went down. I went down. I just went down. So wait when he goes down
[9122.40s -> 9127.89s]  I want to see what he did what happens. I want to get to the point where he goes down
[9130.18s -> 9133.10s]  Okay, he just went down now. Where does he go?
[9137.94s -> 9149.71s]  Every resident sleeper removes the debt by five million. Okay, and he goes left. Okay. He goes left and then
[9153.10s -> 9155.10s]  After he goes left he goes
[9157.33s -> 9162.22s]  Straight he goes after going straight
[9163.49s -> 9169.10s]  Imagine being 12 and trying to do this on your own. Okay after going straight he goes
[9169.82s -> 9179.01s]  Straight again, and then it's a dead end for me. It's
[9180.19s -> 9194.53s]  Not a dead end for him. Why?
[9197.26s -> 9198.38s]  No
[9198.38s -> 9203.18s]  What the wait dead end behind me dead end to the left?
[9204.99s -> 9210.59s]  So I can go straight then so right is a dead end behind me to dead end this left this way right straight ahead
[9210.99s -> 9223.73s]  Straight ahead. This is it. This has to be it forward. Come on. Come on. Okay, so
[9225.30s -> 9226.58s]  No, what?
[9226.58s -> 9233.47s]  Where do I go?
[9235.62s -> 9237.62s]  Left or right
[9237.62s -> 9253.49s]  Left try right. Okay. I'll try right. Oh my god
[9254.45s -> 9260.05s]  Okay, so then if we go straight straight would have been left so we're gonna go straight or right right
[9260.05s -> 9261.73s]  We're gonna go right from here
[9261.73s -> 9266.59s]  Right. No, we're gonna left. I don't know straight right from here
[9267.07s -> 9271.57s]  It's straight from when we first came down straight from here is left when we first came down
[9276.00s -> 9289.18s]  Yeah, let's go right. No, I was wrong. That was wrong. Go back back back. Go back that way. That was wrong
[9289.50s -> 9301.65s]  So now we're gonna go left. Well, this is not even the right. This is not even correct
[9302.13s -> 9329.78s]  This wasn't underneath this before what I was just here. Okay, we're like from here straight
[9330.10s -> 9352.83s]  That was the worst noise. No, it was me clearing my I don't know left
[9353.39s -> 9359.89s]  Left from here. I'm gonna get a fucking t-shirt for completing this game
[9361.47s -> 9374.43s]  That's dead end man. You got that wrong. Not left. Your brain is made for bug snacks
[9374.43s -> 9388.75s]  Okay, we're playing bug snacks tomorrow when he said left again, dude. This is
[9389.47s -> 9391.47s]  How is this
[9392.19s -> 9396.45s]  Even like 30 years ago, how why is this fun? I understand like little puzzles
[9397.46s -> 9403.62s]  But the like guess which way you're going maze first person thing like this not like this. Not even fun
[9404.18s -> 9421.78s]  How many people gave up at this maze? I even followed the walkthrough and it wasn't even right
[9429.58s -> 9432.54s]  You made us do three mazes. Yeah, but that was different though
[9432.62s -> 9436.38s]  Because there was like a thousand of there was like 500 of you that could find it
[9436.78s -> 9448.18s]  It's only one of me here if 500 other people were doing this somebody would find it, okay now
[9448.82s -> 9462.38s]  We get out of here
[9462.70s -> 9465.82s]  Get us out of here, but not yet. Hold on. I gotta get to that fourth disc
[9466.22s -> 9470.22s]  We're like fucking 20 minutes away from the end of the goddamn game. I want to see it so bad
[9470.22s -> 9473.26s]  Don't you know none of you do but I know you might you maybe you do
[9474.54s -> 9483.15s]  This is a screensaver once if we go down then we're on the right track
[9483.71s -> 9495.58s]  That's not down. Fuck watch it on youtube. I did and I followed the exact instructions
[9501.26s -> 9503.26s]  Stop turning. I just went straight twice
[9503.74s -> 9506.11s]  I just went straight twice
[9519.82s -> 9522.14s]  Go to the menu and start the maze with the walkthrough
[9528.88s -> 9531.20s]  Okay, I will I will but one second. Hold on
[9533.14s -> 9543.52s]  The game fax has a full map. It does
[9545.90s -> 9547.50s]  walkthrough
[9547.50s -> 9549.34s]  by anonymous
[9549.34s -> 9555.79s]  Okay. Yes. Okay. All right. All right. Where is it green? Okay click
[9556.35s -> 9564.91s]  Next time into the hole and click the floodlight. This is the maze. Okay. Holy shit. This thing sucks
[9564.99s -> 9566.99s]  Are you kidding me? This is horrible
[9567.15s -> 9573.74s]  Okay, so where where do you start?
[9577.87s -> 9581.79s]  Hold on again
[9581.79s -> 9583.79s]  Okay, I can't paste it in here
[9589.52s -> 9595.71s]  Joe on screen. Hold on a second. Can I do it in a text box?
[9595.79s -> 9602.93s]  That would be actually pretty funny if I could hold on. I hope I can yeah, I can this is so funny
[9606.56s -> 9608.56s]  There you go. Here's the here's the maze
[9610.06s -> 9612.06s]  That's why that's what I have to look at
[9612.06s -> 9626.21s]  Hold on. No, it's not quite correct the spacing, right?
[9630.93s -> 9648.37s]  Wrong font. What font is this? What the fuck is this? This is the map that's on the game fax
[9649.01s -> 9662.10s]  This is him, right? No, the spacing's wrong. The spacing's wrong. Hold on. Let me just take a screenshot of this
[9664.05s -> 9666.05s]  Hold on. Wait a sec
[9667.74s -> 9671.42s]  I gotta check. You know what? I'm gonna take a piss. I'll be right back and i'm gonna get this on screen
[9671.42s -> 9673.42s]  I'll be right back pee time go pee
[9809.15s -> 9811.15s]  Okay, i'm back and i'm ready
[9811.87s -> 9820.90s]  I'm back and i'm ready at the map. I'm ready to rock and roll
[9821.86s -> 9824.18s]  This is what it's supposed to look like not like that
[9825.30s -> 9831.68s]  It's supposed to look like this
[9831.68s -> 9833.84s]  So I have to i'm gonna restart the chapter
[9834.48s -> 9838.59s]  What is farm?
[9838.59s -> 9842.72s]  That's even worse. This is the maze
[9843.36s -> 9852.11s]  There's a map of the maze
[9852.11s -> 9855.62s]  Okay
[9855.62s -> 9857.62s]  What do you where do you start?
[9858.18s -> 9865.98s]  This doesn't make any sense. Um, no, I don't think it does but maybe it might
[9866.46s -> 9871.70s]  What do you mean who made this? Somebody like 20 years ago. Thank god they did
[9871.70s -> 9875.46s]  Otherwise, we'd be here forever and i'd have to turn the video. I'd have to turn it off and I don't want to turn it off
[9876.10s -> 9877.22s]  All right, let's go
[9877.22s -> 9880.37s]  Thank god. They did
[9880.37s -> 9889.14s]  Okay, so let's restart go to the menu
[9889.78s -> 9891.78s]  And restart and what is farm?
[9896.93s -> 9898.93s]  Taking ascii is true dedication
[9900.56s -> 9902.72s]  And this is scene 26. That's what we want. Let's go
[9906.85s -> 9907.89s]  All right
[9907.89s -> 9909.98s]  so where
[9909.98s -> 9911.98s]  This is where are we now farm?
[9914.94s -> 9922.43s]  This has to be farm, right?
[9922.43s -> 9923.81s]  All right, we're in
[9923.81s -> 9925.57s]  Turn on the flood light
[9925.57s -> 9926.53s]  Here we are
[9926.53s -> 9927.57s]  Okay
[9927.57s -> 9939.44s]  So if we go straight we can only go straight the straight puts us if that's cube
[9941.18s -> 9943.98s]  Where are we trying to go?
[9943.98s -> 9946.46s]  I have no idea. I yeah, where does this go?
[9947.18s -> 9949.26s]  bottom right
[9949.26s -> 9951.55s]  Okay, straight
[9951.55s -> 9953.39s]  Then right right?
[9953.39s -> 9959.68s]  We're trying to go to the corridor. We need to go straight all the way and then left so we have to go straight again
[9960.24s -> 9964.56s]  And then straight again and then straight again
[9968.46s -> 9975.71s]  No, what right now we are on cube. I don't know where we are. We're on. No, I know I know
[9976.43s -> 9979.63s]  Right now we are cube two above farm straight up
[9980.67s -> 9984.35s]  so if we go
[9984.35s -> 9988.38s]  Up we go straight again then left and then straight
[9993.14s -> 9996.18s]  Straight again puts us to the third square above farm
[10002.70s -> 10005.02s]  This is where we're in square three above farm
[10005.74s -> 10007.62s]  We're going to go left
[10007.62s -> 10020.08s]  Left will take us to that next one here. I need to be like marking this. I don't think I can though
[10022.18s -> 10025.22s]  Now we are on the one right before the long hallway up top
[10027.28s -> 10032.32s]  And now but wait, hold on. Does this is this direction? Does this take into account direction you're facing?
[10032.96s -> 10036.06s]  So is this technically straight on this one or is that left?
[10036.94s -> 10043.01s]  No, it's straight, right?
[10043.01s -> 10045.65s]  Straight takes us across the pond, correct?
[10046.21s -> 10055.01s]  We're gonna go across the pond here. We're gonna go across and around and down and through and that's not right
[10057.65s -> 10067.82s]  What I don't know where I am. Okay. Now I'm I don't know the way i'm facing started over
[10067.82s -> 10070.22s]  I don't know which way i'm facing. I don't know idea
[10073.54s -> 10076.76s]  Okay, so the idea is you go straight and then left immediately
[10077.30s -> 10083.63s]  That's why we were walking in circles guys because look at the look at the four cubes that are above farm
[10084.48s -> 10086.48s]  How are you ever supposed to figure that out?
[10087.04s -> 10097.26s]  Okay, here we go. I am going to go
[10098.61s -> 10100.08s]  left
[10100.08s -> 10113.14s]  Immediately that puts us right here. We're gonna go straight straight here
[10113.62s -> 10120.10s]  That should take us across but that the line on the left
[10121.30s -> 10127.65s]  No, all right. We're going here we go. We're going down. Okay, we've made it now. I need to go
[10129.18s -> 10136.16s]  Um, I don't I don't understand if if if positional direction is it makes any sense straight again
[10136.72s -> 10142.51s]  No, it would have to be right because that's we came in that way, right? It would have to be right
[10145.84s -> 10147.84s]  And then we go straight
[10152.34s -> 10154.34s]  Okay, so now straight
[10156.62s -> 10163.20s]  Not right into the trash then we go straight again
[10166.56s -> 10172.00s]  Look at the chutes and ladders bullshit if up here if I take a right it takes me all the way back down
[10172.48s -> 10193.84s]  Straight again and then right and we go right. Okay, I forget I forget where we are
[10195.39s -> 10197.79s]  No, okay when we go I forget I don't know where I am. Can we go right?
[10197.79s -> 10199.39s]  I don't I have no idea where I am
[10199.39s -> 10205.15s]  We go right which puts us to the one right before the the the candy cane touches the top of it, right?
[10209.20s -> 10211.20s]  Right and then we bang a left
[10213.94s -> 10215.94s]  And then that should be into the top of the candy cane
[10219.02s -> 10228.72s]  The left should go into the candy cane and then we go down through the candy cane
[10229.44s -> 10232.72s]  And we end up right next to the corridor
[10239.44s -> 10241.12s]  Now we go
[10241.12s -> 10243.55s]  That's not right
[10243.55s -> 10246.43s]  Oh, I don't know. I don't know straight. I think it's straight from here now, right?
[10247.94s -> 10251.54s]  It's going don't say right if if you're agreeing with me say yes
[10252.10s -> 10254.66s]  Straight is the correct way now, right?
[10255.38s -> 10258.90s]  No, don't say right straight is the correct right way. Yes
[10260.51s -> 10263.79s]  No, don't say right straight is the correct way. Yes
[10264.43s -> 10272.64s]  No, are you saying are you saying right lesson to go right? I don't know where I don't know which way i'm facing on this map
[10273.12s -> 10277.39s]  Okay, so if I go straight here, I don't know. I have no idea where I am
[10277.95s -> 10280.45s]  If I go right i'm gonna end up
[10280.53s -> 10282.53s]  Stupid go straight
[10283.54s -> 10286.72s]  straight will
[10286.72s -> 10288.16s]  um
[10288.16s -> 10295.63s]  No, it's not straight. Is it it's straight it is and then now we bang a left
[10296.77s -> 10301.89s]  We go left from here
[10301.89s -> 10309.09s]  Right and now left
[10309.09s -> 10315.46s]  And then straight and that will take us through the corridor
[10317.54s -> 10319.23s]  So technically
[10319.23s -> 10321.23s]  We are okay now straight
[10324.88s -> 10332.43s]  Straight this is it
[10332.43s -> 10337.23s]  Yes
[10337.23s -> 10344.77s]  Wow, that was awful. That was terrible
[10347.20s -> 10358.34s]  Screen so messed up. What the fuck? All right case you did it
[10361.39s -> 10363.39s]  They keep saying I love you
[10363.39s -> 10369.87s]  Does another dead end come on zack we've been in bad before remember that time on tacos 7 when we were pinned down by
[10369.87s -> 10371.87s]  Two back our squads
[10379.07s -> 10385.47s]  Insert disc four such thing as a hopeless situation rigs the engine to create a plasma burst and boom took them all out
[10386.19s -> 10391.01s]  Yeah, all right. Maybe you're right turn off r9k. All right, this is got to be close
[10391.57s -> 10393.28s]  What's this one?
[10393.28s -> 10399.81s]  Open this door
[10399.81s -> 10401.49s]  All right, this one
[10401.49s -> 10404.77s]  Yep, I knew it. We're so we're getting to the end. We're so close
[10404.77s -> 10408.77s]  I'm so glad i'm gonna be i'm gonna be the only person on twitch to have ever completed the died alice encounter
[10410.59s -> 10414.27s]  No one else has beat this game on stream and I will put any amount of money on that like
[10414.51s -> 10416.59s]  But i'm not gonna bet any money because it could be wrong
[10417.23s -> 10421.20s]  This is not a bet. This is me. Just stating a statement that could be real
[10422.50s -> 10433.41s]  It's four going on
[10433.41s -> 10443.46s]  Let's go disc four
[10444.53s -> 10445.95s]  Yes
[10445.95s -> 10448.45s]  Why am I so excited about this?
[10448.45s -> 10450.45s]  This is called the purple door
[10450.69s -> 10453.57s]  Clicking on one of the black lines causes it to turn blue
[10454.21s -> 10459.92s]  The lock responds by turning one of the red lines red. Um, you know what just give me the walkthrough. I don't care
[10460.48s -> 10471.04s]  Okay, uh
[10471.04s -> 10473.76s]  Like uh, this is really this is a really a game
[10473.76s -> 10481.01s]  You must form a closed path of four or longer before the computer does it's very difficult. What did I spoil the game?
[10482.24s -> 10504.96s]  Wait, i'm just gonna watch the video. I don't care. I just read a spoiler
[10505.52s -> 10508.40s]  For like the end of the game. I think on that walkthrough
[10512.03s -> 10514.03s]  All right, let's get it. Here we go
[10514.35s -> 10522.14s]  I just want to get to the end. I love it. I love it. Okay. So how do I do this puzzle?
[10525.89s -> 10532.53s]  Oh shit, it has been three hours. Why do I feel like it's been like 10 minutes. It's been three hours
[10532.85s -> 10544.40s]  Okay, i'm just gonna just go i'm gonna follow word for word the video or stream 2020 no way
[10544.48s -> 10552.13s]  I disagree a thousand percent. No way i'm just gonna follow step by step in the video

[10573.71s -> 10579.46s]  I just I what just happened. This is like tic-tac-toe
[10585.81s -> 10596.30s]  What this is really a game you must form a closed path of four or longer before the computer does
[10600.29s -> 10606.18s]  What the fuck it's like tic-tac-toe, but not
[10611.55s -> 10613.31s]  shit
[10613.31s -> 10648.54s]  Uh, oh my god, give it to me. Give it to me. What don't do it. Don't you dare don't

[10668.69s -> 10672.53s]  Fuck you. No
[10672.53s -> 10674.53s]  What's the connect for the guy say?
[10674.69s -> 10676.93s]  Get off my back. It's something weird like that, right?
[10697.57s -> 10712.45s]  Shit. All right. I'm trying to get this way over here. Fuck man. Yeah, did I win?
[10712.61s -> 10729.92s]  This is gonna be close ready. You dick. Wait, this is it right there go for the bottom go for the top

[10758.18s -> 10763.30s]  Not that one of the connect four has an eyes mouth and legs and stuff and it talks it says something
[10764.66s -> 10765.86s]  Casey
[10765.86s -> 10767.78s]  See if you can figure out what these panels are for
[10775.38s -> 10776.58s]  He's high
[10776.58s -> 10780.40s]  Hold that thought
[10781.28s -> 10787.30s]  I'm about to prove all of you
[10787.62s -> 10789.52s]  connect for
[10789.52s -> 10790.72s]  commercial
[10790.72s -> 10794.83s]  Everyone's about to be like oh fuck. I'm so wrong. You're so right
[10795.55s -> 10809.95s]  Okay, here it comes. I'll take a that shaves at the very least
[10811.01s -> 10813.01s]  100 million dollars off the debt
[10813.17s -> 10815.17s]  100 million has to
[10824.38s -> 10830.30s]  Because I was so wrong. I was on drugs. I was high. I was fucked up. He's imagining worlds again. Nope
[10831.02s -> 10842.40s]  All right, I gotta find a panel. Is it gonna be like a painting on one of these walls?
[10844.54s -> 10849.41s]  Analyze
[10852.10s -> 10862.66s]  Slug found slug amorphous polysilicate comp auto reactive substrata
[10865.57s -> 10869.54s]  Okay, open it up
[10869.62s -> 10874.94s]  ooh
[10874.94s -> 10896.50s]  Blue I get it green. Oh yellow blue
[10899.36s -> 10906.82s]  green
[10906.82s -> 10913.74s]  Analyze we've had a good plus two streak in an hour. I haven't tried to have a plus two streak, dude
[10914.22s -> 10920.61s]  I'm trying to get a streak
[10920.61s -> 10921.81s]  All right blue
[10921.81s -> 10922.61s]  red
[10922.69s -> 10932.56s]  Green did I analyze this the like the big penis?
[10947.26s -> 10956.38s]  Pattern data saved. All right. What do we got? I think those are the only two on this panel
[10958.21s -> 10974.74s]  Or this one green. Oh scan that del swim is streaming samurai jack on youtube right now
[10974.74s -> 10984.19s]  If you guys want to head over there right now, no, don't go there stay here. Okay now orange
[10984.98s -> 10995.60s]  Oh scan that
[10995.60s -> 11004.88s]  Okay anymore just lost a bunch of people. No, i'm fine
[11008.46s -> 11019.65s]  They ain't going anywhere. Okay, they ain't going anywhere then no one's leaving. Oh cope cope. It's not cope
[11019.65s -> 11030.83s]  No one's going anywhere. I kind of don't understand what this wants me to do though
[11031.63s -> 11045.49s]  All right. Um now what data I have like all these pictures in my data
[11050.64s -> 11054.00s]  Dude, that's a weed leaf. That's I know. Yeah, that's a good one
[11058.08s -> 11067.04s]  How many more pictures are there
[11067.12s -> 11069.68s]  Everyone left but you and me that would be so funny
[11071.34s -> 11073.34s]  It's just me and you
[11073.50s -> 11075.50s]  Nobody else just us
[11075.66s -> 11098.27s]  Okay, that was orange. That's it. There's only two pictures per panel. I think that's it. Oh, there's one more panel here
[11103.04s -> 11116.69s]  Oh another panel. You can't even say hello to his only viewer. I'll be honest with you
[11116.69s -> 11125.10s]  I don't remember what their name was. Okay, what's the walkthrough say?
[11126.21s -> 11127.81s]  Each panel will show you two pictures
[11127.81s -> 11134.13s]  You have to click various colors to make the pictures appear click analyze on each picture and translate each using the numeric code
[11134.21s -> 11136.21s]  We've been using with the doors
[11136.29s -> 11142.48s]  What do you mean translate?
[11149.81s -> 11150.37s]  uh
[11150.37s -> 11158.80s]  What do you mean translate x?
[11163.52s -> 11169.41s]  You missed one. I did
[11169.41s -> 11184.37s]  No, I don't want to why do you hate us so much? I don't am I gonna play something else?
[11184.53s -> 11186.69s]  Yeah, once I get to the end of this we're putting in blade force
[11187.09s -> 11196.83s]  Take a round for that one. Uh, I don't even I don't understand. Okay. I'm just telling you guys right now
[11196.91s -> 11201.15s]  Uh right after this next sentence in the walkthrough. I see the words finale
[11203.50s -> 11204.30s]  so
[11204.30s -> 11207.84s]  We just have to uh, literally watch the video of how the person doing this
[11218.13s -> 11226.85s]  Yeah, well the finale is right after this whatever it is. All right. What the fuck does this even want me to do?
[11232.10s -> 11238.78s]  All right, so you go you you go to each panel you scan each picture and then I think I leave
[11239.42s -> 11245.47s]  How do I just leave? How do I get away? I can't leave
[11248.40s -> 11265.09s]  Leave how do I fucking leave? What is this game called? Actually? It's called the die dallas encounter
[11268.08s -> 11269.28s]  I got them all
[11269.28s -> 11273.49s]  This is horrible. Yes. I know this game is
[11274.03s -> 11278.93s]  Absolute utter dog shit. I know but i'm at disc four and i'm gonna i'm gonna win
[11279.49s -> 11296.38s]  Is there one that I didn't scan? Did I not scan this one? Did you get it?
[11304.48s -> 11306.40s]  At this this just
[11306.40s -> 11308.40s]  This no like what?
[11308.88s -> 11311.36s]  What how would you even know what to do here?
[11318.70s -> 11321.16s]  How like what?
[11321.16s -> 11322.38s]  Translate
[11322.38s -> 11331.57s]  What do you mean translate? What am I supposed to be translating?
[11336.51s -> 11337.71s]  I wish I could just
[11337.71s -> 11345.07s]  Fucking get a save state and skip this because this is this is just why would you ever know what to do here?
[11345.47s -> 11350.48s]  This is stupid
[11350.48s -> 11352.88s]  On their video that this is easy too
[11353.60s -> 11361.33s]  And they have like a weird interface I don't have like a pc interface data. How do I like even do this?
[11363.25s -> 11364.85s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[11364.85s -> 11372.69s]  Okay, green blue yellow. Yeah, sure. What the fuck do you want me to do?
[11373.25s -> 11400.05s]  Huh grandpa hit the enter key
[11401.97s -> 11406.03s]  If we scan this one
[11406.03s -> 11409.07s]  Maybe you have to scan them all. I don't remember the guy leaning over the sphere
[11410.03s -> 11412.98s]  German this is painful unplug it
[11417.15s -> 11418.29s]  Yeah
[11418.29s -> 11430.48s]  Symbol pull the plug pull the plug. Is it weird that I I I can't because I have to spite finish this game
[11430.88s -> 11433.38s]  I definitely didn't see this one
[11433.38s -> 11442.08s]  Okay. Now I got that I got it
[11445.52s -> 11447.52s]  sunk cost
[11447.52s -> 11466.74s]  Well, it's not sunk cost if you eventually get to the end somewhere somewhere in the world that somebody really embarrassed this game exists
[11468.72s -> 11472.08s]  Like they they like fucking designed and programmed this game shit faced every day
[11472.48s -> 11488.93s]  They probably don't even remember that they made this they hotboxed the office
[11489.89s -> 11496.38s]  I can't dude. This doesn't even make any fucking sense
[11499.01s -> 11501.01s]  Even the walkthrough doesn't make any sense
[11503.89s -> 11508.37s]  Patterns saved. Yeah, I mean, I know I have like these patterns in this but what am I supposed to do with them?
[11509.17s -> 11531.22s]  I can't even leave the slabs enhance it. I have like I have this data ship, but I can't even interact with it
[11536.99s -> 11541.39s]  All right. I'm getting close. I'm getting close to ripping it out. You're right. I'm getting really close. Is it gonna happen?
[11541.95s -> 11550.32s]  I'm getting close to ripping it out

[11747.95s -> 11749.95s]  Did they forget to program it into the 3DO?
[11757.86s -> 11762.04s]  I don't think I think they forgot to program that into the 3DO version of the game
[11766.18s -> 11768.36s]  I'm not even going to go over here. I'm not going to click on any of this shit

[11872.66s -> 11874.66s]  Okay. So now
[11874.74s -> 11880.43s]  I've got the data
[11880.43s -> 11883.92s]  forgot it all

[11891.09s -> 11894.66s]  It's better not be like a screamer puzzle tutorial. Hold on
[11895.30s -> 11926.42s]  Nobody has a link to the puzzle. Hey guys, we're gonna do a quick, uh puzzle tutorial on the like dallas's

[12013.25s -> 12025.65s]  Data data. Wait, hold on all the one of the tutorial
[12026.80s -> 12031.60s]  I can't because he just he he goes by and scans everything and then he leaves. I can't leave
[12031.84s -> 12039.50s]  I dallas encounter give me another walkthrough
[12040.67s -> 12051.04s]  The game facts one doesn't help at all. There's another one
[12054.34s -> 12060.19s]  No, i've already seen that one. I'm one for the 3do. If I could even if it even exists
[12060.75s -> 12065.84s]  You found one
[12065.84s -> 12069.30s]  All right. I'm not i'm gonna find it myself

[12917.89s -> 12919.89s]  Just always assume it simon says
[12920.13s -> 12929.66s]  Okay, so just match the color of whatever is on the screen if this is wrong
[12930.46s -> 12933.34s]  And it's your fault if we have to watch her go across the balance beam again
[12933.90s -> 12946.32s]  Fuck you. I'm gonna go watch a furry movie

[12989.92s -> 12991.44s]  I can't do anything
[12991.44s -> 12996.90s]  I clicked the fork probably 30 or 40 times

[13024.32s -> 13026.40s]  While we watch the cutscene for like a fifth time
[13026.96s -> 13037.07s]  What's happening here i'm gonna watch that guy's walkthrough again
[13039.28s -> 13041.28s]  We linked to that guy's speeder
[13051.70s -> 13054.74s]  This guy has no idea that he's like saving this stream
[13058.02s -> 13060.22s]  All right. So what happens?
[13060.22s -> 13070.18s]  It's so close

[13131.38s -> 13132.74s]  I don't have that

[13156.62s -> 13164.56s]  I don't have it watch the speed run again. He just has it open
[13166.10s -> 13168.10s]  It has pink green orange
[13169.31s -> 13219.73s]  Pink green orange is what he has for like a thing for data up and then it just completes it. I'm so mad

[13422.58s -> 13426.78s]  I'm soft locked the solution was right in front of your eyes
[13427.10s -> 13433.47s]  It's not your fault. You have to go back and scan the purple door. What?
[13433.87s -> 13441.42s]  What do you mean scan the fucking purple door? What are you talking about? Go to the previous scene?

[13992.99s -> 13999.26s]  I don't I have no idea where I am in this map. You finished what you fucking started
[14009.81s -> 14011.81s]  Here is a map with the starting location
[14012.45s -> 14015.52s]  If this is a picture of my ass, i'm gonna be mad
[14020.45s -> 14022.45s]  You made this bed now lying in it
[14022.53s -> 14027.41s]  No, I didn't I got to the end of a game that was made 25 years ago when they forgot how
[14028.21s -> 14029.17s]  Whatever
[14029.17s -> 14041.28s]  This is like the stone age of making video games. They were hitting they were they were bashing their computers with fucking stone tools
[14041.60s -> 14044.03s]  That's how old and shitty this is
[14054.10s -> 14056.10s]  Go into the maze and turn on the floodlight
[14057.49s -> 14060.45s]  This is so much easier than a fucking map
[14070.40s -> 14080.50s]  Go into the maze turn on the floodlight forward forward left forward left left left right forward. You're out of there. Thank you forward
[14082.06s -> 14091.73s]  forward

[14123.90s -> 14125.90s]  Two hops this time
[14127.54s -> 14129.54s]  Freestyle
[14130.18s -> 14142.83s]  I forgot where I am left three times double dream hand put your hand over there left left

[14161.70s -> 14163.70s]  How many left is that there's one more left, right?
[14167.84s -> 14173.04s]  That's it left and then a right and then forward so they go right and then forward
[14177.28s -> 14182.34s]  Okay, right and then well, let's just relax. You know, let's just chill

[14216.05s -> 14218.05s]  Scan this door. I get the cube
[14220.06s -> 14222.06s]  I will not forget the door. Not this time
[14234.54s -> 14236.54s]  Are you in someone's intestines
[14238.38s -> 14240.38s]  Our squads
[14245.90s -> 14247.90s]  Chat is so divided
[14250.38s -> 14255.74s]  That's like please I hate this you'll have chats like you sleep in the bed that you made
[14258.19s -> 14262.66s]  Scan
[14262.66s -> 14266.42s]  That's actually what I had. You've got to be kidding me. I can't believe that this is like what I had to do
[14267.22s -> 14269.90s]  I just didn't scan the door
[14270.14s -> 14278.11s]  I'm sad
[14278.11s -> 14280.11s]  Possible language detected
[14280.78s -> 14282.78s]  It's some kind of alien language
[14284.59s -> 14286.35s]  And there it is
[14286.35s -> 14288.35s]  That's the I have the three. Oh
[14305.02s -> 14306.86s]  It's all right. This is it

[14309.36s -> 14310.64s]  it's time
[14310.64s -> 14314.27s]  for this end
[14314.59s -> 14331.14s]  I think I just put in just two
[14331.14s -> 14335.62s]  Thank god. Okay. Now I know what to do. I've got everything settled and ready to go
[14336.18s -> 14342.77s]  Turn the music off. Oh shit. Okay, sorry

[14405.89s -> 14412.56s]  My feet are starting to hurt airy. How did they put in moving walkways?
[14413.57s -> 14418.13s]  Tell me zack. Do you complain just to make conversation or do you honestly enjoy it?
[14418.77s -> 14424.85s]  Geez airy, my dogs are aching. Okay. Have you no sympathy? I'm saving my sympathy for you when you'll really need it
[14425.65s -> 14429.81s]  When you run out of things to scan that that one and then we're good casey
[14430.45s -> 14435.33s]  See if you can figure out what these panels are for. I will I will yes. Yes me me me me me me pick me

[14440.93s -> 14444.45s]  Pick me pick me pick me pick me. All right, uh
[14445.66s -> 14446.54s]  Oh
[14446.54s -> 14453.39s]  Do I have everything scanned? I think I already have all this shit. Yeah, I think I already have all this stuff
[14453.39s -> 14462.67s]  Don't I it was the important one right here, right? Yeah, I have I already have it all
[14463.23s -> 14478.94s]  Just go left three times
[14478.94s -> 14480.62s]  Shit, okay. Hold on
[14480.62s -> 14502.85s]  I already scanned these though. I've already scanned these I have to do it all I have to scan them all again
[14502.85s -> 14504.77s]  But it's they're already in my database
[14504.77s -> 14518.19s]  Praise yeah, the shit's all in the database already just activate them
[14518.19s -> 14526.74s]  Yeah, I just I think I just have to have seen them and then we can finally move on to the end of the game
[14527.14s -> 14540.51s]  But okay, we've seen it seen these
[14540.83s -> 14544.90s]  I don't have disk five
[14544.90s -> 14561.70s]  That doesn't exist and it yell at that person everyone yell at that person. Okay, good. We got that one now
[14562.42s -> 14575.92s]  Look at this one. All right. What are you doing? Everybody yell. All right, there it is
[14576.48s -> 14578.05s]  All right, we're good
[14578.05s -> 14593.36s]  Okay, see if you can figure out what's going on here. Okay, what look they're starting to read
[14595.01s -> 14598.56s]  Stop reading don't read in my face ever again
[14607.76s -> 14617.38s]  Okay scan this one. Thank you scan scan scan scan if we go left then we go left then we go left and it's over
[14624.61s -> 14637.97s]  Wait, I have to look at these
[14637.97s -> 14642.82s]  Okay, we're done. That's it
[14642.82s -> 14657.41s]  left left left left left left left left
[14667.98s -> 14681.41s]  The mca what what happened? He's already scanned. I already scanned them all. They're already in my database
[14681.73s -> 14701.73s]  You have to left. Okay, i'm gonna do exactly what I did last time
[14702.45s -> 14719.78s]  I scanned that one and then I just went left three times. This has been quite a journey. He's still here
[14719.94s -> 14722.42s]  No, um, this game sucks asshole
[14723.06s -> 14727.46s]  So if you do not do a very specific thing of sequences you cannot finish the game
[14727.94s -> 14730.82s]  So let's just get that really clear for that person that just showed up
[14737.20s -> 14739.20s]  Where's the one that I have to do exactly?
[14740.77s -> 14744.05s]  Game sucks. Gotta finish it. Well now it's kind of like remember um, remember clock tower
[14744.69s -> 14746.13s]  and we got like
[14746.13s -> 14749.33s]  Two-thirds of the way through clock tower and I was like, I hate this but I was like, oh, this is kind of fun
[14749.33s -> 14763.41s]  At the same time though. So I've had I had to finish it. Where is that stupid panel?
[14763.89s -> 14768.05s]  With the symbol that I have to scan this and then go left three times
[14770.69s -> 14786.03s]  You're having fun yet. Okay. Here we go. Ready scan this and then move left three times. That's what I did last time
[14786.83s -> 14800.88s]  Here patterns say left left left left
[14801.20s -> 14820.83s]  You didn't scan the blank object this all these things have already been scanned. I'm like replaying it
[14821.15s -> 14825.86s]  What's wrong with the mic quality? Oh, apparently things fucked up. I guess
[14830.08s -> 14836.02s]  Okay, so last time I did this I went left three times and then it just went to the cutscene
[14836.82s -> 14843.79s]  Now I did left three times and didn't do anything. I just went left twice or three like
[14846.54s -> 14851.09s]  Don't go into the menu
[14851.33s -> 14854.14s]  What do you mean go to the menu?
[14856.11s -> 14857.71s]  Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second
[14857.71s -> 14862.91s]  Are you telling me that you think that I now that I have this in the in the computer system that I can just skip
[14862.91s -> 14867.89s]  To the next scene
[14867.89s -> 14870.74s]  Wait a minute
[14870.74s -> 14873.40s]  Oh shit, I think we may have just found a loophole
[14891.50s -> 14896.06s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go you guys fucking how you just pumped
[14896.70s -> 14924.61s]  Purple, what was that demon noise? Somebody's my mic was messed up
[14925.25s -> 14936.06s]  It sucks fucking get out of this game. Um, we will
[14936.70s -> 14939.30s]  We're so close to the end
[14939.30s -> 14941.30s]  Worst noise from the worst stream
[14941.30s -> 14946.82s]  That's not even accurate. Can't you guys not you can't just say every stream is the worst screen
[14947.54s -> 14950.28s]  It's not how that works. You're all in big trouble
[14967.18s -> 14969.18s]  This one actually is omega low
[14974.34s -> 14976.34s]  All right, here we go
[14977.38s -> 14979.44s]  Thank you
[14979.44s -> 14980.96s]  I did it
[14980.96s -> 14988.03s]  Let's see the end
[14988.03s -> 14992.80s]  Quick. Well, i'm taking her gun and putting it in a bag
[14995.82s -> 14997.82s]  They're gonna fall out of that bag
[14998.53s -> 15000.53s]  That's what happens when you put the milk
[15002.46s -> 15003.50s]  and like
[15003.50s -> 15005.70s]  Oh
[15005.70s -> 15009.54s]  That's a bad grocery backpacking. So if you put like your your milk
[15010.58s -> 15012.26s]  Inside of a bag like that
[15012.26s -> 15015.14s]  And you don't have anything else to put the weight on the other side. You're gonna fuck yourself up
[15030.06s -> 15039.34s]  Now full thrust you guys thought this was porn week, this is torture with I torture you on screen
[15046.53s -> 15050.43s]  Same thing
[15053.06s -> 15058.93s]  I can't wait for bug snacks tomorrow. I still i've got a lot of 3do games to play. Well, maybe we'll go back to 3do on sunday
[15069.95s -> 15073.09s]  I'm playing bug snacks tomorrow
[15080.46s -> 15089.89s]  Some of that bacon wine you like so much hell tuba. What is he even saying? Tell me you could pass up
[15096.02s -> 15098.02s]  He's talking about bug snacks
[15109.71s -> 15111.89s]  Oh, he hates bug snacks
[15111.89s -> 15113.89s]  I don't know what you guys are talking about. He hates it
[15119.76s -> 15123.01s]  Okay now
[15123.01s -> 15131.15s]  Where are we going now? Why are we going so slow?
[15139.09s -> 15140.61s]  It's very
[15140.61s -> 15142.61s]  When there's no sense of urgency at all
[15152.02s -> 15159.71s]  Uh, are we gonna get a final boss reveal here?
[15160.51s -> 15176.27s]  I guess that just about does in case you haven't noticed eric. We've done all six doors
[15176.67s -> 15181.87s]  We're fresh out of options. No more options. No, we can backtrack and find the things we missed the first time around
[15181.87s -> 15186.35s]  What we don't have time to go through this entire ship again get close to that sun. Remember?
[15188.66s -> 15195.87s]  Um, I don't do that might as well face it area. This floating mausoleum is taking a plunge
[15196.67s -> 15200.67s]  And we're going along for the ride. No, i'm not doing without a fight zack
[15201.39s -> 15207.22s]  You know your problem is eric you've never known when the fight is over
[15218.69s -> 15225.28s]  Why are they giving up
[15225.28s -> 15232.30s]  You're actually once
[15236.77s -> 15242.50s]  What I always hoped I'd die in better company. Oh, yes. No. Yes. Yeah, I mean too
[15248.51s -> 15250.51s]  Squeaky clothes have you figured that out?
[15257.18s -> 15266.78s]  What uh, okay, wait yellow
[15267.58s -> 15268.94s]  blue
[15268.94s -> 15270.78s]  yellow red
[15270.78s -> 15278.86s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[15278.86s -> 15288.98s]  red green
[15288.98s -> 15297.12s]  Red, all right, we're gonna go to red scan that
[15301.20s -> 15312.70s]  All right. I have red
[15312.70s -> 15314.70s]  alien pattern chroma symbols
[15314.94s -> 15320.54s]  Why is it not over?
[15320.54s -> 15324.51s]  Uh, I I think it is
[15324.51s -> 15336.38s]  Oh, thank god. I scanned this fucking door. That would have been horrible if I didn't. All right. Um, what are you doing?
[15338.91s -> 15340.91s]  This is the we're at the end. This is disc four, man
[15341.23s -> 15344.51s]  I warn you jeremy beat this game and one billion is added to that. I don't agree with that
[15348.88s -> 15353.63s]  I don't agree with that. What are you talking about? I was just telling me to insert disc two
[15360.40s -> 15368.26s]  What what do you mean disc two?
[15368.26s -> 15369.38s]  I don't understand
[15369.38s -> 15377.82s]  Why do I have to this game's not 40 hours long. We're on the final disc
[15381.63s -> 15385.39s]  Wait, this is you can skip the red door if you already have the orb from the crew quarters
[15385.79s -> 15401.46s]  Did I get the orb from the crew quarters? I got a orb fuck if I know
[15404.30s -> 15411.52s]  No, what the hell is this?
[15411.52s -> 15417.90s]  Is I didn't I never went in here. Oh, i'm really good at these. I'm really good at these i'll do fine
[15418.56s -> 15421.20s]  I already know what it wants me to do
[15445.02s -> 15447.02s]  This is a little bit harder than I thought it was gonna be but it's all right
[15454.21s -> 15465.41s]  All right, I have to make everything on I got it then um
[15468.85s -> 15475.76s]  What is it what does it want to do?
[15475.76s -> 15488.40s]  Oh, this actually is the fine guys. This is the final puzzle of the game. Wait, what the fuck I have to do that
[15491.57s -> 15495.60s]  I have to do this
[15504.10s -> 15506.58s]  Holy it's yours top right no shit

[15527.94s -> 15529.94s]  It's close
[15534.13s -> 15536.13s]  Can I fuck it up?
[15537.58s -> 15540.70s]  Hold on wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[15545.26s -> 15561.74s]  Oh, I did it no
[15570.51s -> 15573.84s]  And then
[15578.48s -> 15580.48s]  It's the final puzzle of the game I got it
[15585.63s -> 15589.28s]  Hmm
[15591.04s -> 15594.11s]  None of you got shit on me
[15594.11s -> 15595.95s]  None of you got shit on me
[15595.95s -> 15598.50s]  None of you got shit on me
[15598.50s -> 15602.42s]  Ain't nobody got shit on me. Ain't nobody got shit on me
[15603.14s -> 15614.59s]  Now what?
[15614.59s -> 15626.98s]  Uh, congrats. You beat it on easy. Who cares?
[15627.78s -> 15631.23s]  Eat the bug. I don't think I can eat the bug
[15646.90s -> 15658.75s]  Uh, what am I supposed to be doing bug? Wait. No, I was already in here. What happened? Did I get an orb?
[15659.23s -> 15678.21s]  Did I get an orb? I don't remember getting an up an orb in here. Snap the disc. No, there's no
[15678.85s -> 15689.62s]  Does anybody remember if I got an orb in here? Can I tell if I have one? How many do I have?
[15690.26s -> 15698.85s]  I can't even I don't have that info. Is an orb an egg?
[15699.57s -> 15704.77s]  I'm so fucking close. I've got to just get I have to end this. I'm so close
[15706.05s -> 15716.16s]  It's something in this room. Is this the room where you paid no attention?
[15718.32s -> 15745.82s]  Absolutely, this is open. All right. This one doesn't open. Does this one open the whole game? You mean have I been in here?
[15746.69s -> 15756.53s]  I don't think i've been in here. Is it an orb? I can't select it
[15757.25s -> 15769.98s]  Orb orb orb. I can't get it. No, I can't get anything in here an orb in here
[15776.58s -> 15778.42s]  I don't I didn't there's not one in there
[15778.42s -> 15784.82s]  Is what happens when poop wine gets in your veins somebody you didn't say that. I just said that for you
[15791.02s -> 15793.18s]  Do I already have the thing?
[15793.18s -> 15796.06s]  You can skip the red door if you already have the orb from the crew quarters
[15796.14s -> 15800.78s]  But you're assuming this walked was assuming that I paid attention to anything that happened like four hours ago
[15801.26s -> 15824.48s]  I have this sneaking suspicion. He's nowhere near the end. No, this is the finale what they said's
[15824.94s -> 15830.44s]  Backtrack you added a backtrack section to the finale you assholes
[15843.26s -> 15844.40s]  Okay
[15844.40s -> 15848.72s]  This says go to the crew quarters kill the alien and get the orb
[15851.09s -> 15866.62s]  Uh, this is what is I don't see an alien. Didn't this alien die already?
[15867.10s -> 15871.52s]  Did we pull an orb out of this alien?
[15874.67s -> 15878.75s]  It didn't it was like oh there was something glowing. We pulled an orb out of the alien's head
[15879.23s -> 15883.84s]  Remember the alien that came down and died and the thing glue was glowing on his head
[15883.84s -> 15888.35s]  Didn't we pull it out of him? We pulled an orb out of his head. Didn't we I don't remember
[15888.43s -> 15898.45s]  It felt like it was like two weeks ago. No, you did not do that. Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[15899.09s -> 15908.00s]  Glowed but I didn't interact with it. This is obviously the crew quarters
[15908.64s -> 15940.38s]  That's obviously an orb up there. Here we go. Here we go. Let's go. I have to look in each one of these holes
[15942.38s -> 15945.33s]  No way
[15955.65s -> 15960.83s]  I see something in there
[15962.32s -> 15963.68s]  No
[15963.68s -> 15965.68s]  No, I don't wanna
[15968.94s -> 15971.34s]  No, I have to look at all the holes
[15971.82s -> 15997.74s]  I'm gonna get jump scared turn on the light. I can't just be ready to kill the bug. I'm ready
[15999.09s -> 16012.38s]  I'm gonna laser this fucking thing the second it shows up. Oh Jesus
[16015.73s -> 16017.97s]  I'm gonna absolutely laser the fuck out of this thing
[16033.52s -> 16036.72s]  I try to think of the logic when you make a game like this, right? Like, okay
[16036.80s -> 16040.80s]  Let's have like 40 holes that you look in and each hole takes
[16042.00s -> 16048.75s]  Like six or seven seconds to look in I try to imagine the the the functionality here
[16064.21s -> 16066.21s]  Is it is it in is it in?
[16066.85s -> 16077.22s]  Turn the light on. I don't I have no light you have to activate night vision. There's nothing in the holes. What?
[16080.06s -> 16097.17s]  Bullshit, why would they have you do this top row top row top row top row?
[16106.99s -> 16116.93s]  You're doing it. Please need to check all the holes twice. No, you don't
[16117.57s -> 16132.18s]  The best part about this is the walkthrough just says go to the crew quarters kill the alien get the orb
[16132.42s -> 16137.98s]  They didn't they left out the part where you have to look in 100 holes. Is there another walkthrough?
[16146.56s -> 16147.94s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait
[16147.94s -> 16152.34s]  Enter through the partially open door into the crew quarters and cross over to the far side come back to the door side
[16152.66s -> 16157.06s]  Swing right to the second column of triads click on the lower triad than the upper right hole
[16158.18s -> 16160.26s]  Can you say can you say that to me like in english?
[16161.86s -> 16165.86s]  Like come back to the door side swing right to the second column of triads click on the lower triad than upper
[16167.20s -> 16175.84s]  I can't I like I I can't understand what that's saying partially open door come back to the door side
[16176.32s -> 16180.16s]  Swing right to the second column of triads click on the lower
[16183.41s -> 16186.30s]  What?
[16186.30s -> 16188.30s]  Wait, go back towards the door
[16196.16s -> 16200.38s]  Okay, swing right
[16200.38s -> 16202.14s]  second column
[16202.14s -> 16204.30s]  lower ones top right
[16225.81s -> 16228.98s]  I can't believe this is in the game. I can't
[16229.62s -> 16249.36s]  I can't believe it. This is the guy that actively tortured his viewers
[16249.44s -> 16252.08s]  Yes, because what I want this should be a lesson and that you all right
[16252.08s -> 16255.44s]  Those you guys that are like teaching game design in college or whatever some of your professors here
[16256.08s -> 16264.05s]  Download just get this whole game and then make your class play it and say don't fucking do that. Don't do this ever
[16264.45s -> 16280.24s]  This is educational purposes at this point professor professor elbison. Why did you make us do this?
[16280.32s -> 16282.08s]  We had to look through all these holes
[16282.08s -> 16282.96s]  Yeah
[16282.96s -> 16284.32s]  Sucked didn't it?
[16284.32s -> 16286.88s]  Yeah, it was horrible and like the the part of the game we had like
[16288.00s -> 16289.60s]  scan the the
[16289.60s -> 16292.48s]  Scan the wall and stuff. Yeah, that part was bad too. Wasn't it?
[16293.12s -> 16295.20s]  Why did you make us do that?
[16295.20s -> 16298.72s]  And then I take my glasses off and put my fucking feet on the desk
[16301.68s -> 16303.68s]  Why don't you tell me?
[16304.43s -> 16308.94s]  You'll be the teacher and I have the teacher student cup. No, not bare feet
[16311.82s -> 16313.34s]  All right, where?
[16313.34s -> 16318.90s]  I'm told i'm getting tortured too. You know that right like i'm but I have to finish it
[16319.30s -> 16325.52s]  This is one of those torture streams where I torture the fuck out of myself for educational purposes only
[16329.22s -> 16330.50s]  I missed one
[16330.50s -> 16332.74s]  Okay, this is towards the door swing, right?
[16333.14s -> 16344.74s]  Was spam that coffee pasta again, please watch the speed run it was fake
[16351.42s -> 16354.94s]  Back it back to uh back to the channel that speed running it
[16355.90s -> 16360.10s]  Okay, let's see
[16360.10s -> 16366.74s]  he comes in
[16366.74s -> 16374.48s]  Torture, this is the definition of sunk cost fallacy. Yeah, but eventually okay
[16374.48s -> 16381.42s]  So you go towards the back and then bang of right?
[16381.42s -> 16384.46s]  It's almost over and I can't wait for it to be over and by the way, we're not done
[16384.54s -> 16386.46s]  Like i'm not done streaming after this
[16388.00s -> 16390.40s]  So it's the you go to the second one and then
[16392.51s -> 16394.50s]  I didn't already do that
[16394.50s -> 16413.38s]  Top left one. Oh my little one. I didn't look in I can't imagine sitting here and doing this not having like a walk
[16414.58s -> 16416.74s]  Okay, attack it. That was really scary
[16417.70s -> 16423.57s]  Shoot him. That was scary
[16430.54s -> 16431.34s]  You know
[16431.34s -> 16432.54s]  Give me the orb
[16432.54s -> 16434.85s]  Let me open give me the fuck out of here
[16434.85s -> 16441.10s]  Give me the orb
[16445.77s -> 16449.95s]  BDSM stream show us your webcam and yeah, you're gonna get a bds
[16452.03s -> 16455.87s]  I turn on the webcam. I'm in like a bunch of bdsm gear. Now that would have been funny
[16457.57s -> 16460.77s]  That would have been really funny. It would have been worth the four and a half hours of torture
[16461.25s -> 16466.05s]  Okay, can I get the can I get the orb that fell out of his head?
[16466.69s -> 16490.37s]  Okay, I got it. We're done. Let's go you guys getting pumped. Here we go. We're out
[16490.93s -> 16507.65s]  Now we have to go to the yellow door. We're done. Watch out for the revved up heavy
[16520.30s -> 16522.30s]  That was
[16523.10s -> 16525.79s]  That was really good
[16526.27s -> 16529.62s]  Very very funny
[16529.62s -> 16552.35s]  Okay, yellow door. That's a brass beast. Not just any minigun. Oh natasha. You're right. No wrong. That's wrong
[16563.15s -> 16565.15s]  Why does that take my favorite thing of the day?
[16573.15s -> 16575.95s]  Just around one of these corridors it's just a heavy
[16578.58s -> 16581.06s]  That person made it all worth it. They really did
[16588.98s -> 16592.61s]  Here we go
[16592.61s -> 16596.93s]  Let's go. Let's go yellow door yellow door yellow door. Look what I found guys
[16609.47s -> 16611.47s]  The game fax walkthrough

[16621.66s -> 16623.92s]  Isn't this fun?
[16623.92s -> 16625.92s]  All right, uh go to the yellow door
[16635.65s -> 16638.45s]  yellow door
[16638.45s -> 16655.63s]  Yep, scan it. All right. They don't already have this
[16656.35s -> 16662.06s]  I already have the yellow door
[16662.06s -> 16667.79s]  Yeah, I already have this door. They did the puzzle already. Yeah, this shit just opens man
[16673.47s -> 16681.07s]  This this says go through the to go through the next door and then turn left
[16694.54s -> 16714.85s]  Okay, go through this door and there's apparently an orb in here and then just to the left of this door
[16716.34s -> 16739.30s]  There is an orb dispenser right here. Oh the other left. Oh, hi
[16739.30s -> 16742.78s]  Hi, all right
[16742.78s -> 16763.22s]  Uh, this is right. I can't really interact with anything even with the guide because it's like go
[16763.78s -> 16765.70s]  Okay, i'm gonna read the seal out
[16765.70s -> 16770.34s]  Click yellow to open it go through the next door turn left go through the door and turn around just to the left of
[16770.34s -> 16784.34s]  The door I was right. All right, then it says send it yellow
[16788.26s -> 16798.62s]  sent
[16798.62s -> 16805.94s]  Grab it. Nice orb number three
[16806.50s -> 16812.90s]  Pick it up. Everybody. Just pick your hands up
[16813.54s -> 16815.30s]  How did you stand up?

[16829.38s -> 16837.39s]  What everybody just put your hands up everybody everybody you could just stand up
[16838.03s -> 16845.01s]  If you put your hands up, everybody just stand up

[16847.87s -> 16851.84s]  Everybody to stand up
[16851.84s -> 16856.00s]  Now we go back to the hub and we have all three orbs and then we can finally end this
[16856.00s -> 16858.00s]  I
[16858.78s -> 16860.82s]  Don't even know which one of these doors goes back to the hub
[16860.82s -> 16864.92s]  We're gonna click on random ones and if we find the way back to the hub, I have no idea. I'm crying. I'm crying
[16864.92s -> 16866.38s]  I'm crying. I'm crying
[16866.38s -> 16876.87s]  Well, what happened? I'm not gonna that's like a sexual thing. I'm not gonna put that on screen. This is not the right way
[16876.87s -> 16887.07s]  Is it I'm lost wait? No, I'm lost. How do I go? What do I get out of here?
[16887.07s -> 16907.00s]  I don't know. I'm actually lost you can sit down here. This is the wrong way. Yeah backtrack
[16908.25s -> 16920.69s]  Absolute bullshit. I fall off here and I swear I'm gonna be so upset. What the fuck are we doing here? What is this?
[16922.75s -> 16936.27s]  How did I get a hair why am I here go back get me the hell out of there I'm rage finishing the game
[16938.12s -> 16946.35s]  This is a case study. This is an educational stream some reason they decided to put us upside down
[16962.83s -> 16978.88s]  Actually like this one you can't add any debt unless I agree to it I have to agree to it
[16978.96s -> 16998.87s]  Is there even a door here isn't this the way that I just came oh go to go that go to that blurry direction
[16999.07s -> 17009.07s]  Wait, this is not you see the link yet. Is it it's the wrong way again
[17010.31s -> 17014.80s]  It's just
[17014.80s -> 17016.80s]  unclear fucking anything
[17020.86s -> 17025.60s]  Just reload the last chapter from the menu, I hope this works
[17026.30s -> 17031.27s]  Wait, does that it's gonna work. Is this actually gonna work? I don't know man
[17032.03s -> 17034.00s]  Should I've not have done that?
[17034.04s -> 17042.70s]  Don't know I don't know if I should have done that. Oh my god. Should I not have done that? Oh my god
[17042.70s -> 17047.68s]  Oh my god, what do I do? What have I done? What the fuck did I do?
[17048.28s -> 17054.74s]  Please don't tell me I fucked this whole thing up. I'm not I'm telling you right now
[17054.74s -> 17058.26s]  I'm not going back and doing this shit again. I would rather eat my own hand
[17058.26s -> 17062.42s]  I'd rather you cut my fucking hand off and put it in the oven and cook it like 350 for two hours
[17062.42s -> 17068.40s]  And I eat it on stream. I'd rather do that then go back and do the like last 45 minutes
[17068.44s -> 17075.55s]  I know I said I'm gonna shit my pants like shit all over me and then before I just gonna go on back and beat it
[17075.55s -> 17085.62s]  I'd rather eat myself. I'd rather fucking pull it myself. Right. I've said this like three times. Do I have the orbs?
[17087.36s -> 17091.76s]  Please tell me I have I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back. I can't go back
[17091.76s -> 17098.91s]  I can't go back. Is there with me to check? Oh my please god. I hope I don't have to go back
[17098.91s -> 17105.94s]  I hope I don't have to if I I please I have all the orbs, right?
[17105.94s -> 17111.02s]  I got them all and I just went I just did different scenes
[17121.61s -> 17123.97s]  Definitely keeps it stored in the cache. I know it does
[17124.57s -> 17134.84s]  Stored in the cache because the other ones were stored and we jumped around to different sections of the game. It's ready
[17134.84s -> 17141.29s]  It's here comes the three orbs. We have them. Oh, wow. You found them. Wow, you got all the orbs put the orbs in here
[17141.57s -> 17148.81s]  You did a great job Casey. Excellent work. We all love you and you're all very you're smart. You're very smart
[17149.49s -> 17154.18s]  We don't did it and here are your three orbs
[17154.88s -> 17157.31s]  Here are the orbs
[17157.55s -> 17159.55s]  Hey
[17175.18s -> 17177.18s]  No, it's not even
[17178.54s -> 17179.94s]  Why
[17179.94s -> 17184.08s]  Why why why why why?
[17187.86s -> 17197.76s]  Why I know it I know what they all are. I'm gonna eat my fucking hand
[17198.20s -> 17204.35s]  Add this to worst meltdown of the year. I don't care. This job. I have to I'm gonna eat my fucking hand put it in the oven
[17205.07s -> 17218.80s]  Open this fucking door right now. I know where they all are. I know where they are. You're building the guillotine
[17218.80s -> 17220.80s]  I'll put my head in that thing
[17226.70s -> 17229.42s]  Open the fucking door. What are you doing?
[17230.02s -> 17237.60s]  What? Oh
[17237.60s -> 17262.52s]  Man, this this game probably costs like 30 million dollars to make crack each disc in half when you're done
[17262.68s -> 17267.40s]  Why I don't even know why I listen somebody said hey skip but it was perfect in perfect reason though
[17267.40s -> 17273.52s]  It was very reasonable thing to say like go to the menu and skip all this and then you were right
[17273.52s -> 17287.95s]  You were so right that would that made perfect sense. You're a monster. I know that's okay. I'll wear that
[17287.95s -> 17289.07s]  I'll wear that today
[17289.07s -> 17295.23s]  But we're like of one cutscene away from beating this game and I cannot I can't get to the end of this shit
[17295.23s -> 17304.32s]  And then give the fuck up. This is perseverance. I know exactly where it is. Just get it
[17304.32s -> 17311.04s]  I know the other one is just get it and then just keep track of where you are. I bet this left not that way
[17311.16s -> 17314.91s]  Okay
[17314.91s -> 17317.07s]  Okay, so when I come out I take a left and leave
[17317.63s -> 17335.93s]  Done shoot the alien in the head. This game sucks though. What the hell I know I know and I knew it
[17336.27s -> 17341.39s]  Okay, after our number two, I knew it sucked but it kept me here. It
[17342.15s -> 17346.23s]  It's forcing me to beat it with like radiation rays
[17346.23s -> 17348.41s]  I don't know what this thing's emitting but it's making me want to do it
[17348.51s -> 17367.07s]  See this look at how much fashion this was this time. We're good done. I already got one. Why is he dead?
[17367.47s -> 17375.68s]  What are you talking about? So I have wait I have this one. I have this I have it
[17376.08s -> 17412.54s]  Why do I you need to go yellow instead? But now hold on I didn't turn I'm not softlocked with the exit over here
[17415.94s -> 17423.66s]  Default return scene. No, no, it's because the yellow one. I didn't turn it in it remembers that I turned in this one
[17423.66s -> 17431.98s]  I didn't give the yellow one yet. That's true. Okay. All right, makes sense. I have to change fucking discs again
[17432.26s -> 17436.50s]  There is no God I know this now
[17436.50s -> 17445.19s]  this is the evidence of it imagine if you're one of the game developers and you happen to stumble upon this stream and
[17445.23s -> 17448.07s]  this guy watching it and seeing how much everyone hates this and
[17448.63s -> 17454.75s]  Then you hear somebody you you read somebody in the chat that says there is no God because of this game in this frame
[17454.87s -> 17459.22s]  Like you gotta click the X and just like kind of go like take a shower
[17459.84s -> 17463.74s]  like you can't
[17463.74s -> 17470.42s]  Somebody's playing the tidalis encounter. I like was a game designer on that. There is no God because of this game
[17470.50s -> 17472.46s]  Oh
[17472.46s -> 17476.79s]  What the fuck? Holy shit shuttle down
[17477.49s -> 17485.76s]  What's wrong with you guys? You don't understand. We were working on computers that had like 56k motive
[17488.46s -> 17493.54s]  And loading up one of these FMVs into our program took three days
[17494.10s -> 17499.60s]  Fuck all of you assholes. How dare you this game was like
[17500.14s -> 17516.77s]  Gold back 30 years ago. We're gonna let this asshole talk shit about it. I mean, they're right there. You know, they're right there
[17532.50s -> 17545.14s]  All right, let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's get it
[17545.50s -> 17555.81s]  And the left the orb. All right, bang a left and when we come up with being in a right remember that
[17556.13s -> 17564.64s]  Let's get lost Omega Loaf
[17565.80s -> 17575.41s]  There it is
[17575.41s -> 17598.16s]  Excuse me. Give me that orb. I'll take it who tis grab that shit. There's no skipping cutscenes
[17598.56s -> 17605.86s]  I wish I could add up. All right out of here bang a right straight through that door
[17605.86s -> 17615.42s]  Get me the fuck out of here and the game and it you're aging your chat by playing this look
[17615.42s -> 17618.35s]  It's only been like, okay
[17618.35s -> 17625.74s]  I have probably like six thousand hours on stream four or five of these are day Dallas encounter
[17625.78s -> 17629.66s]  That's like zero point zero zero zero one percent of all the streams I've done
[17629.66s -> 17635.34s]  That's not so that means a ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of all streams were fucking incredible games
[17635.94s -> 17639.98s]  Well besides half of them that we're not very good. So I'd say like
[17640.62s -> 17645.49s]  Forty nine point nine nine nine percent are very good games
[17645.49s -> 17663.34s]  All right, he keeps doing he keeps playing trash games over and over again, but they're the most charming except for this one fuck this
[17663.34s -> 17666.70s]  I'm gonna stream I'm doing a spite stream. All right, whatever fine
[17666.70s -> 17670.94s]  Well, you're gonna you can upload pictures of me like then talk shit to me on my own new stream
[17670.94s -> 17672.94s]  You're gonna talk you're gonna do like a shit talking stream
[17676.57s -> 17680.07s]  He's gonna restream my stream and then talk a bunch of shit about me
[17681.90s -> 17686.58s]  Yeah, yeah, you're gonna be a big trouble if you do that one
[17696.16s -> 17719.08s]  Now what what that's all the orbs go to the orange door. He didn't know
[17735.25s -> 17742.34s]  New offer, please stop. Oh my fucking god, please stop stop make it stop
[17743.34s -> 17756.58s]  Why do I look like that what's wrong with my eyes? All right, let's go. This is the final door. I know it
[17756.58s -> 17758.50s]  This is the last door. I know it for a fact
[17758.50s -> 17778.39s]  It's free after you end the game on disc three. That's kind of weird that an hour ago
[17778.83s -> 17781.76s]  I'm just going by what the we're in the finale
[17782.32s -> 17800.75s]  The finale was two hours ago. Yeah, it's a long finale

[17859.49s -> 17881.59s]  Was this I didn't I didn't scan the orange door
[17903.40s -> 17909.96s]  There's only like five sentences left in the walkthrough guys. Don't worry. We're gonna get through this together
[17910.20s -> 17924.28s]  We're gonna get through this. I know I'm like talking like this a zombie apocalypse right now
[17924.32s -> 17939.95s]  We're gonna get through this just stay together. Oh, fuck you. Oh, please end the game
[17939.95s -> 17957.60s]  I'm done going as fast as I can. I'm going as fast as I can Nevada stream

[18011.31s -> 18014.03s]  7,000 people were tortured today in a freak streaming accident
[18014.75s -> 18025.74s]  How would it be a freak streaming accident if I'm deliberately torturing you? There it is. Okay, go on in
[18034.20s -> 18036.88s]  Or a freak streaming accident where a guy
[18037.72s -> 18040.76s]  Tortured seven thousand people for five hours
[18041.24s -> 18045.74s]  No, I didn't like leave the stove on
[18046.18s -> 18082.56s]  You're the Joker. I'm not the Joker. I'm the Riddler now anybody that says they're the Riddler is actually the Joker
[18083.08s -> 18114.95s]  Anybody that says they're the Joker is actually the penguin that recycled joke. Well, maybe okay. Wait, what's this?
[18114.95s -> 18119.73s]  I touch anything else in here before I end, you know, we're in the last two sentences of
[18120.77s -> 18121.77s]  the
[18121.77s -> 18134.14s]  Game, you know what I mean guys, you know, I mean, I actually played penguin in the show Gotham. You're pretty talented actor

[18190.44s -> 18207.02s]  You need six. I mean six. It's not six orbs. There are six doors. Therefore. There are six orbs. No, no, no
[18207.02s -> 18221.82s]  No, that's not accurate. That's not accurate. It's not true. That's not I have the I have the guide right in front of me
[18221.82s -> 18256.90s]  The guide is right here across the guide Pepe left. Yeah, why wouldn't I first stage?
[18256.90s -> 18261.01s]  I thought you said first disk of grief, which would have been much funnier
[18276.42s -> 18278.42s]  Just you guys
[18280.72s -> 18295.91s]  The five discs of grief wait, what do you mean? No, I don't I don't know there's no more discs
[18295.91s -> 18297.39s]  What do you mean? I have to get well, I don't know where they are
[18297.39s -> 18320.54s]  The guy didn't say to get these these spheres the guy did not say to get the spheres. Where is these other spheres? What?
[18320.70s -> 18337.14s]  Ah
[18337.14s -> 18342.06s]  Ain't worth it. It's been five hours
[18344.02s -> 18351.65s]  Six orbs who is this for you hate playing and we hate watching

[18363.62s -> 18367.22s]  I can't even tell you I wish I could say it's for me. It's not
[18367.74s -> 18382.60s]  What what's this for? It's just it's to complete it. It's just playing itself turn it off
[18382.64s -> 18384.88s]  Stop then. Uh, but what I
[18385.64s -> 18393.26s]  But I'm busy much time in here, but there's so much time in here. Well, wait, let me just see how quickly this could be
[18393.26s -> 18395.38s]  I'm already at four out of six stones
[18396.10s -> 18398.05s]  stones
[18398.05s -> 18414.34s]  Guys, my go XLR is broken. I can't even mess with any of the settings. Does it sound like this the whole time?
[18414.54s -> 18427.09s]  All right, what we where are the last two cubes? There are five orbs. All right, there's only five
[18427.43s -> 18432.43s]  Where's the last one? Where's that last one blue hole?
[18432.83s -> 18445.45s]  Was that last one guys? They're not seven orbs. This is five blue hall. Hold on
[18445.73s -> 18458.61s]  Okay, I'm facing the statue click blue and see the orbit. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[18458.61s -> 18463.33s]  We go go go go go go go go go go go go go. This is green, but fuck. It's okay
[18463.33s -> 18483.28s]  Go back. We're gonna go through the blue door. I got the I know where the blue one is blue door
[18483.42s -> 18487.70s]  Let's go. I saw the blue
[18487.94s -> 18496.66s]  Orb up top. I already have the blue door scanned. I got it. Okay, so we go through here. Just go in
[18504.94s -> 18510.75s]  I'm trying to hit blue. There's three you got it quick. Now. I know exactly what I'm doing
[18512.26s -> 18514.62s]  There's so many fingerprints on the bottom of that disk. I don't care
[18515.10s -> 18526.05s]  Okay, so when we're facing the statue click blue and see the orbit puzzle
[18526.21s -> 18546.23s]  There's a statue in this room. Look for that statue and then the orb is in the statue
[18546.31s -> 18569.40s]  This is very is huge room. The orb is inside of Casey. Well, you just fucking ruin the game
[18569.64s -> 18577.87s]  Okay, there's an orb inside of this. Here we go. Use blue
[18588.46s -> 18611.91s]  How do I use blue trying to use blue when facing the statue click blue and see the orbit puzzle
[18612.21s -> 18633.44s]  Shit. All right, we go. Now what?
[18641.24s -> 18660.34s]  What did I just do?
[18660.34s -> 18664.94s]  Okay, what four of the planets are directly movable call them a B C and D
[18665.14s -> 18675.54s]  Okay, or the planets are movable. They're ordered in the bottom right selection window
[18675.54s -> 18687.48s]  You must move the fifth planet over the Sun move a to 11 o'clock
[18687.72s -> 18697.30s]  Which one is a move a to wait analog move a to 11 o'clock. I need the analog clock
[18700.73s -> 18704.95s]  Hold on move a to 11 o'clock
[18706.34s -> 18723.94s]  I don't even understand what the fuck you're talking about. Am I move am I moving the planet right now? Okay
[18723.94s -> 18735.98s]  Well, here's like 11. I can't like directly touch them. Okay, so this is this one's here a at 11 o'clock
[18736.54s -> 18742.34s]  be at
[18742.34s -> 18744.34s]  C to 430
[18746.22s -> 18748.65s]  C to
[18750.55s -> 18755.34s]  12 1 2 3
[18756.90s -> 18768.87s]  430 what the fuck are you talking about put it in 120? What? I?
[18774.79s -> 18793.41s]  Don't like understand what where's this fifth planet? Look at the bottom left. Yeah, but this am I how I
[18793.69s -> 18803.08s]  Don't even know what I'm looking at here. This is the planet in the middle, but I'm not moving this planet
[18803.12s -> 18815.17s]  How do I do how do I move the actual planets instead of just but why does it put a to like 1130?
[18815.17s -> 18817.60s]  Like what is even talking about?
[18817.64s -> 18820.65s]  ragget like
[18822.81s -> 18824.81s]  Jesus what the hell is this?
[18825.93s -> 18833.80s]  Okay, put a to 11
[18834.56s -> 18836.66s]  Alright a at 11
[18836.66s -> 18840.50s]  C 430
[18840.50s -> 18869.85s]  See it's like that's like kind of 430 right B to 120. Where is it? It's kind of 120
[18876.78s -> 18881.01s]  It's like 11 right up here
[18881.77s -> 18894.13s]  Now what move to face the statue and click send that's for what?
[18894.81s -> 18921.61s]  Isn't this the one I'm moving up here? No, look at the yellow dot. What planet am I actually trying to get to?
[18921.85s -> 18924.01s]  This is too fucking much
[18926.37s -> 18943.30s]  This is just this is just bizarrely set up. This is put this to 11 o'clock. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa
[18944.22s -> 18958.33s]  Wait like this like put that there. Let's see 430
[18961.00s -> 18963.68s]  Wasn't I I was already doing that. All right, this is like 430
[18965.46s -> 18970.38s]  D 120 it's already there
[18971.66s -> 18992.06s]  Wow, what this is C C is that 120 a at 11 C at 430 D at 120
[18992.06s -> 18996.35s]  Oh
[18997.11s -> 19003.33s]  I'm too drunk for this. I feel like a microwave
[19003.93s -> 19011.68s]  Then send it. Well, no, this this has to be doesn't have to be I have to be over the this right
[19012.08s -> 19014.64s]  It doesn't say anything about B
[19015.29s -> 19019.57s]  Solution move a to 11 C to 430 D to 120 you might need some minor adjustments
[19019.57s -> 19021.77s]  But you do not have to move C at all
[19022.21s -> 19034.04s]  What B is they it's wrong. It's a typo C to 430 a B to 430
[19034.80s -> 19042.13s]  C you don't have to move C at all. So where was C in the beginning?
[19042.33s -> 19057.75s]  It literally says solution move a to 11 C to 430 D to 120. You don't have to move C at all
[19069.48s -> 19079.27s]  They meant B at the end well, how is it a to 4 a to 11 a to 11?
[19080.58s -> 19083.46s]  C to 430
[19084.02s -> 19095.57s]  E to
[19095.73s -> 19096.81s]  120
[19096.81s -> 19109.26s]  They're already so you don't have to move B at all. What what what is that it?
[19109.90s -> 19125.90s]  All right, send it. Oh, it's wrong. B was good. So the so the so the guide was wrong make minor adjustments
[19126.72s -> 19152.12s]  That's not 120
[19152.68s -> 19155.84s]  12 what this is 120 right here
[19157.28s -> 19165.25s]  By the way, there is no minute hand. So what are you talking about? He's been looking at the wrong guide
[19165.69s -> 19176.60s]  Give me give me another guide. This one's fucking wrong. There's no minute hand
[19177.00s -> 19179.00s]  Omega lol stacum's brain
[19179.52s -> 19192.32s]  Somebody just had it planet 1 to 430 planet 2 3 planet 3 3 planet 4 of 330
[19192.52s -> 19194.36s]  That's completely
[19194.36s -> 19210.78s]  Inaccurate from the guide that I'm looking at right now. I think you might have a case of a CD
[19211.44s -> 19216.65s]  Remember chat left an hour ago. You're talking to nobody. This is on easy
[19217.96s -> 19232.90s]  Reset the puzzle. Hold on that reset. What is it? What this is? I don't think I can even reset
[19232.90s -> 19236.14s]  I don't I don't think I can reset this. I literally can't reset it
[19241.74s -> 19246.90s]  I have to turn the console off or restart the chapter. I'm not doing that. I'm gonna do it for him
[19247.34s -> 19254.03s]  Read this and it's a paste bin. I don't know what the fuck that is
[19257.75s -> 19263.24s]  Why does this have to suck? I can't stop
[19263.88s -> 19275.92s]  No, the guides were written like 25 years ago. So, of course, they're gonna be fucking inaccurate and messed up
[19276.44s -> 19288.84s]  There's only one walkthrough of this game that exists on game fax. It is one person on PC
[19289.48s -> 19305.84s]  Alright, what's that guy? Give me that guy again. There we go. Let's go. Let's go. Here it is
[19307.31s -> 19313.33s]  What does he got? What's he got? Let's see how fucking wrong this was. Okay, the one is completely wrong, by the way
[19313.75s -> 19329.20s]  So a is down here. See is fuck
[19332.56s -> 19339.94s]  Okay, a is actually right here a is literally right here it was completely fucking wrong
[19340.36s -> 19344.32s]  B is also right there
[19344.88s -> 19349.74s]  The guide was
[19349.78s -> 19351.34s]  1000% wrong
[19351.34s -> 19360.62s]  C is down at around 6 o'clock
[19361.22s -> 19371.80s]  Where is D? D is top left D
[19374.49s -> 19408.46s]  There it is. Count
[19408.86s -> 19440.81s]  This counts, right? I'm watching his stream. He's having trouble with it, too. Almost there. What happens when he gets it?
[19440.81s -> 19452.07s]  He's having trouble, too. Yeah, this like sucks. He's having trouble. I'm getting it too. I'm right there with you man
[19452.07s -> 19462.60s]  Oh, is that not it? That's not it
[19463.32s -> 19495.40s]  Yep, bunch of you guys had it wrong. Okay. What the fuck is this doing? What's this? What does he do? Quick, tell me what you do
[19495.96s -> 19522.40s]  What do you do? Use the blue code. It's the infinity stones. I
[19523.16s -> 19533.54s]  Can't believe I'm fucking still here doing this. What am I doing? Am I what's happening? Am I doing this?
[19533.80s -> 19540.93s]  Hey, this is it. I need one more after this is the green door
[19541.61s -> 19553.71s]  That green door man
[19553.79s -> 19575.08s]  Well, I need green hall. Okay. Okay. I know what to do. Oh, would you what would you rate this game so far?
[19575.52s -> 19582.20s]  What would you rate punching yourself in the stomach as hard as you can?
[19582.20s -> 19598.60s]  We're like a zero ain't I'd read it higher than this. Yeah, we lost like a thousand viewers. It's alright
[19598.60s -> 19603.38s]  It don't matter. They'll see you tomorrow for bugs next. I am need to spite-feet this game
[19603.64s -> 19620.65s]  This is the worst game you've ever played it might be but at least I can say I finished it
[19620.65s -> 19635.96s]  I'll be able to wear that on my sleeve forever. We have one more door to go into you haven't finished it yet
[19635.96s -> 19647.28s]  I'm about to the worse than saw to a thousand times worse saw to is would be at the game Awards ahead of this
[19647.32s -> 19659.34s]  All right green door turn around when you get to the black opening there's an orb dispenser
[19661.58s -> 19666.64s]  It's the worst than watchdogs Legion that stuff
[19671.26s -> 19702.67s]  You know why because I'm still playing this screen was fun, it's just awful in every way
[19704.03s -> 19705.87s]  That's so
[19705.87s -> 19718.52s]  It's chaotic neutral. I have green right now. I don't I don't know. I don't have a green door
[19718.80s -> 19720.00s]  I
[19720.00s -> 19732.97s]  Pair budgets with a current Ubisoft game
[19734.09s -> 19744.79s]  Friday the 13th. Oh, it is Friday the 13th. Maybe that's why I'm so fucked up. Is that why I'm so fucked up right now
[19744.79s -> 19747.95s]  I want to do this and like did they torture myself? Is this why it might be?
[19750.08s -> 19758.92s]  Actually really might be why yeah, this is like a scary screen screen. You're right
[19759.48s -> 19771.40s]  Well tomorrow's a Friday the Saturday 18th. Okay, I'm concerned now because of what I just said
[19772.00s -> 19777.84s]  Tomorrow's Friday the Saturday 18th tomorrow's Friday the Saturday
[19777.84s -> 19787.13s]  I think I'm concerned now what I tried to say was tomorrow was Saturday tomorrow was Saturday
[19787.83s -> 19791.96s]  For it. I don't know what I was trying to say there. What was I doing? I don't know
[19793.00s -> 19809.87s]  How often does a Friday the 13th come by the way is it once a year once every like few years once every few years
[19810.27s -> 19831.12s]  Does that happen every year happens yearly? His brain is rotting
[19836.02s -> 19838.02s]  Someone should check on you
[19838.02s -> 19849.77s]  Okay, so here is why this game is dumb. This is where you get the orb
[19850.41s -> 19869.59s]  These my children are crying German. I don't want to see this anymore
[19871.31s -> 19874.67s]  This shouldn't be here anyways, this should be studying or something
[19875.39s -> 19878.97s]  be
[19878.97s -> 19888.68s]  playing
[19888.68s -> 19894.56s]  Friday yeah, they should be playing should be making like a fort in the house of
[19895.68s -> 19897.69s]  pillows
[19897.69s -> 19899.45s]  mattress toppers
[19899.45s -> 19911.76s]  Cardboard. All right, let's get out. How do I get out of here?
[19915.20s -> 19924.34s]  I flew in this way. You don't I don't have to go through the maze again, right?
[19924.46s -> 19949.81s]  No, I can't probably just walk forward from here. I don't know why everyone hates the stream. I'm literally. Yep. Thanks
[19949.81s -> 19960.57s]  I have to go through I actually have to go through this. It's alright. I think I still have the

[19995.34s -> 19998.66s]  Thanks to the stream. I have a really bad toothache and watching you suffer helps
[19999.10s -> 20017.78s]  Well, I'm sorry about your teeth. Hope that feels better soon. Let me go left three times
[20018.62s -> 20043.22s]  Left again. I just fed my cat and took a shower. I thought we were on disc for we were
[20045.18s -> 20067.17s]  Originally one more and then we go right and forward build a Ford on stream
[20067.63s -> 20076.32s]  That should be kind of fun. Can you hurry up? My sister's giving birth and I kind of want to be there
[20076.32s -> 20079.92s]  Oh, don't worry. You're not missing much. It kind of looks like this. I
[20088.84s -> 20107.86s]  Made it. All right. I'm out of there now. We're gonna go back to the chamber is this way. It's for let's go
[20107.86s -> 20129.04s]  I got all the spheres. It's time to end this the dead

[20149.18s -> 20161.00s]  All right, put them in the device and let's turn on the ship and leave who dare summit me
[20161.72s -> 20175.69s]  Well, that was I thought it was gonna be much bigger and scarier it's a Furby it's Elmo
[20177.15s -> 20180.28s]  Did you summon me mr. Noor?
[20181.54s -> 20187.75s]  What are you summoning me for?
[20188.03s -> 20190.03s]  Hold on a little while
[20196.45s -> 20198.45s]  Put them into my sphere
[20198.45s -> 20201.41s]  The goals you see you're a genius
[20215.29s -> 20217.45s]  I'm getting a little it's getting that's turning into Eddie
[20220.10s -> 20225.73s]  Yeah, dude, let me try I don't have a human hand. Oh, all right, it's not me
[20243.30s -> 20250.55s]  Guys guys you're accidentally bowling under my name
[20254.23s -> 20258.88s]  My can I get to
[20259.04s -> 20261.04s]  slot on this thing
[20267.97s -> 20277.72s]  Let me do it thanks, I think Casey do it I'm the one that got them all I
[20278.20s -> 20284.04s]  Can't even do one. I'm the one that actually wouldn't make them all up
[20286.76s -> 20341.62s]  Now what I don't know go to orange door the guide says I have to get like an alien hand. I
[20341.74s -> 20355.68s]  Have to go get an alien hand didn't get the alien hand who will activate the final device burn
[20356.12s -> 20363.47s]  Yes, it was the whole thing was like a paragraph. Look, this is what it says
[20363.95s -> 20381.16s]  This is the end after that. This is causing me mental harm
[20381.68s -> 20388.85s]  But what what look why don't you just mute the stream for a minute and just go open up another tab
[20389.57s -> 20392.37s]  just go to like
[20392.37s -> 20394.61s]  relaxing puzzles or
[20395.09s -> 20397.91s]  relaxing music and
[20398.59s -> 20406.46s]  We're gonna sneeze go to Pornhub. Look, I cannot tell you what you can and can't do on your own computer
[20407.06s -> 20411.99s]  Some of you guys write this is the weird thing. So you might be on Pornhub right now on another tab
[20411.99s -> 20413.43s]  I don't know
[20413.43s -> 20416.02s]  You really might be there and you might be listening to me talk
[20416.02s -> 20419.52s]  Which is kind of weird turn me off turn me the fuck up turn me off right now
[20419.52s -> 20423.26s]  I don't do that X out of my window and just did go out of here
[20423.48s -> 20436.28s]  What does it want to do do not have me on turn me off with that?
[20436.60s -> 20466.22s]  I want you to do that like red then blue what click red then click
[20466.72s -> 20487.36s]  Red then blue then are what I mean click up left up high is a control device

[20602.87s -> 20606.97s]  I thought I said the same thing about you and now you said that and I don't know how I feel about you know
[20607.07s -> 20641.78s]  Okay. Now I have this hand. Okay now I go back with the hand eat the hand. All right

[20659.78s -> 20666.68s]  I've been losing viewers for the last like three hours. I don't think I'm aware of this. I mean, all right
[20666.68s -> 20690.22s]  I know here's the career ending stream. Sorry. It's fun. It's fun. We're outlasted
[20701.74s -> 20705.01s]  What did I fart oh
[20705.01s -> 20708.78s]  Right, right
[20710.02s -> 20718.94s]  As I said, you both blamed it on me it's one of you two wait, that's not what I had to do
[20719.30s -> 20722.95s]  No, what the fuck?
[20723.11s -> 20756.75s]  What was the hand? Where is it? Look up you fucking idiot? I'm not looking up because you told me to insert disk one
[20769.63s -> 20791.91s]  Why are we doing earthworm Jim where did that come from I'm bashing my head against the wall auto-tune
[20791.91s -> 20802.36s]  I thought I thought I'd sit on this is it. This is the end. We've made it to the end of final cutscene on disk one
[20803.93s -> 20805.05s]  alien hand
[20805.09s -> 20808.90s]  Why did I play this for six hours?
[20808.90s -> 20814.92s]  This was supposed to be like a 3DO grab bag stream not die Dallas encounter full play through
[20849.79s -> 20860.27s]  Job let's go Casey
[20867.61s -> 20869.61s]  We just got going into this thing's mouth

[20893.00s -> 20895.00s]  It's gotta be 85 in here and rising
[20895.32s -> 20900.63s]  He was disguised all along
[20901.63s -> 20912.96s]  Yes, I have one case check them out Harry. You see that. What was he disguised as a navigational console this guy?
[20912.96s -> 20916.64s]  I don't mind if we hijack his ship see what Casey comes up with. I shoot him
[20917.16s -> 20919.16s]  Looks like he's studying some kind of readout
[20919.72s -> 20922.34s]  Why he's adjusting those light beams?
[20924.45s -> 20932.11s]  What's that thing in the center? I don't know things are starting to heat up around here. Look we gotta do something we can do something now

[21290.47s -> 21292.47s]  Sacrifice your friends. I did that twice
[21292.79s -> 21301.25s]  Okay, here we go. They all fly away. We go into this room
[21316.52s -> 21321.96s]  It's really not that hot there is talk to it

[21387.70s -> 21389.90s]  Chrysalis this is fantastic
[21391.30s -> 21393.86s]  We must be the first humans ever to witness this
[21394.90s -> 21396.90s]  Hope we don't look like appetizers
[21397.66s -> 21399.66s]  It's different from the other creatures. We've seen
[21400.38s -> 21403.57s]  Look, the other one is bowing
[21404.33s -> 21406.33s]  Maybe this is the new queen
[21411.49s -> 21413.49s]  Uncut gems music. Oh
[21416.07s -> 21431.52s]  I miss log the force field created by the creatures which called themselves study
[21432.32s -> 21434.36s]  Protected us and the ship from the intense heat
[21435.16s -> 21442.18s]  The cranny there fled or were destroyed when we passed through the stars Corona the newly born Queen possesses
[21442.44s -> 21445.72s]  race memory and incredible psychokinetic abilities
[21446.64s -> 21450.80s]  She improved Casey's translation abilities and then answered many of our questions
[21450.80s -> 21457.55s]  Why is she talking like Cartman?
[21457.55s -> 21467.72s]  Say void, friends. May our paths cross again. Farewell.
[21486.72s -> 21501.68s]  Here comes like the rock song.
[21501.68s -> 21507.84s]  For a second I thought Tia Carrera was a developer in the game.
[21507.84s -> 21513.54s]  I was like, are you serious?
[21513.54s -> 21532.77s]  Sorry, sorry, can you hear me now? Sorry, sorry, I'm trying to get you out.
[21532.77s -> 21537.99s]  Wait through the credits. You should feel ashamed of yourself for doing this.
[21537.99s -> 21544.23s]  Look, I feel fine. I feel great. I just feel, I just kind of have a headache now.
[21544.23s -> 21570.02s]  Best boy.
[21570.02s -> 21589.89s]  Troubles are far too greedy.
[21589.89s -> 21609.69s]  Cheers.
[21609.69s -> 21638.98s]  Time for Windows 2.0. That's very old.
[21638.98s -> 21650.90s]  There you think you are. Get to those consoles.
[21650.90s -> 21677.99s]  Did I shoot her accidentally? That's not what I wanted to do. No, that was wrong.
[21677.99s -> 21681.99s]  There you think you are. Get to those consoles.
[21681.99s -> 21718.69s]  Okay, I turned it off. I just turned it off. I turned it off. I got out.
[21718.69s -> 21724.30s]  Wait, the camera's on and I got no clothes on.
[21724.30s -> 21736.93s]  I think that's kind of where I have to end this stream. It's been six hours. I gotta go.
[21736.93s -> 21742.37s]  Alright, we're gonna go back to 3DO on probably Sunday.
[21742.37s -> 21748.51s]  One game, Andy. 3DO was your greatest mistake.
[21748.51s -> 21755.22s]  No, I'm playing 3DO. I love this console. I just don't, I'm playing 3DO later this weekend. I'm gonna do it.
[21755.22s -> 21760.53s]  We're playing Bugsnax tomorrow, and then maybe Bugsnax on Sunday. Maybe 3DO next weekend.
[21760.53s -> 21764.53s]  I don't know if that, there's still like, well, there's like 20 games on 3DO.
[21764.53s -> 21768.28s]  I just made everybody, I just tortured everybody.
[21768.28s -> 21772.28s]  You literally, you literally made a stream of Die Dallas Electric Boogaloo.
[21772.28s -> 21779.03s]  Okay. Yeah, Bugsnax is tomorrow. Yeah, I've played Demon's Souls. I don't have a PlayStation 5. I forgot it came out.
[21779.03s -> 21783.87s]  I didn't pre-order one. I didn't even know it came out.
[21783.87s -> 21787.11s]  Italics told me that it came out. I didn't even know it came out.
[21787.11s -> 21798.12s]  I forgot it even existed, which is fine. Don't worry, I'll get one eventually.
[21798.12s -> 21807.33s]  I will get one eventually, and I'll play the games on it.
[21807.33s -> 21813.87s]  There's only like three games on it anyways, and the first generation, the first generation of new games on a new console
[21813.87s -> 21818.87s]  is always, always just games that were already in development for the old console
[21818.87s -> 21821.87s]  that they ended up just pushing forward to the new one anyways.
[21821.87s -> 21827.67s]  So I'm fine for like another six months. Don't worry.
[21827.67s -> 21835.58s]  There's a few games that were made specifically for the PS5, but besides that, I mean, whatever.
[21835.58s -> 21843.10s]  I'll get it like in a few months. That's COPE. Yeah, it is.
[21843.10s -> 21847.10s]  All right, I'm going to send you guys to, I'm going to send you guys to Joel actually,
[21847.10s -> 21851.77s]  because you know what Joel is playing tonight. Joel is playing Half-Life Alyx.
[21851.77s -> 21857.89s]  So that's pretty pog. That's a huge pog.
[21857.89s -> 21863.99s]  So I'm going to send you guys to Joel. It's actually a good streamer.
[21863.99s -> 21868.17s]  All right, you're banned for life. I'm, I'm, no, you know what, let's go.
[21868.17s -> 21870.17s]  Let's go. Where's that comment? Where is it?
[21870.17s -> 21872.17s]  You're getting banned for life. I'm going to do it myself.
[21872.17s -> 21875.17s]  You're going to be the screenshot German out of five banned you for life.
[21875.17s -> 21884.81s]  Good ending or right? I already got the good ending. We just did it.
[21884.81s -> 21890.71s]  They like solved all the world's problems and we got all their like devices.
[21890.71s -> 21893.71s]  Let's actually, let's go make sure I didn't miss any money or anything.
[21893.71s -> 21897.92s]  Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.
[21897.92s -> 21904.60s]  Tomorrow is Bugsnax. Playing that for a little bit.
[21904.60s -> 21908.60s]  Give a very special shout out and thank you to Sharfers, the streamer.
[21908.60s -> 21916.08s]  Speedruns Die Dallas encounter. The only reason why I was able to even complete the game is because he exists.
[21916.08s -> 21928.62s]  It's the only reason why. Without that we would have to rely on 20 year old game facts write ups.
[21928.62s -> 21940.05s]  The MVP. Let me minimize this though.
[21940.05s -> 21945.48s]  Let me minimize that. I think I X'd out of a ton of things. Hold on.
[21945.48s -> 21955.40s]  Yeah, I did. Just want to see if I didn't want to miss any, if there was any large bit drops or donations or anything.
[21955.40s -> 21960.05s]  There was. There was a shitload of community subs too.
[21960.05s -> 21967.22s]  We had 10 from Putrefreshen. We had 10 from Niershu. We had 10 from Anonymous.
[21967.22s -> 21972.40s]  We had 10 from TheWheelOfRime and then 5 from Illusiary.
[21972.40s -> 21979.85s]  Thanks guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for your community subs.
[21979.85s -> 21988.21s]  And then there was 50 bucks. There was 5,000 bits from Scrumpleton.
[21988.21s -> 21995.30s]  Thanks for the 50 bucks. A gigantic bit drop.
[22001.30s -> 22016.34s]  He wasted his ego stream on this. Yeah, I did. I did. It was in a panic. It was in a rage.
[22016.34s -> 22026.74s]  I need to look at this. Why is it Peter?
[22026.74s -> 22038.13s]  Don't go to twitch.tv slash German 985 on November 13th, 2020.
[22038.13s -> 22041.62s]  Worst mistake of my entire life, Lois.
[22046.50s -> 22057.62s]  It wasn't the worst mistake of your life. Eating the McChicken that you put in the fridge.
[22057.62s -> 22061.98s]  That's been an uncountable, unrememberable amount of days.
[22061.98s -> 22068.13s]  But you hope it was less than 5. And you eat it.
[22068.13s -> 22072.30s]  Was the worst mistake of your life. So don't even be cute with me.
[22072.30s -> 22080.28s]  Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Go say hello to Joel.
[22080.28s -> 22084.29s]  I played through that game. I beat Half-Life Alex. Let's see how Joel does.
[22084.29s -> 22091.76s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Good night, goodbye.
[22091.76s -> 22096.76s]  And thank you for joining me on a stream that a lot of people were very, very happy with.
[22096.76s -> 22099.94s]  I can't even fucking talk.
[22099.94s -> 22103.94s]  Alright, I'll see you tomorrow for Bugsnax. Eat em up.
[22103.94s -> 22107.26s]  Good night, guys. I'll see you tomorrow.
