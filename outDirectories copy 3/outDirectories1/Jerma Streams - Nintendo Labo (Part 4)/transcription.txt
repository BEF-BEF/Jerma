[2.04s -> 18.49s]  Hey, how are you? Vod, yeah, well, I mean, this is the start of the Vod, you're right. How are you
[18.49s -> 43.54s]  doing? Give me one second. Did the tweet go through? Let me check. Yeah, it did. Good afternoon,
[43.54s -> 51.38s]  everybody, or good evening. Show us the green. Today is not the green screen stream. The green
[51.38s -> 64.73s]  screen stream is scheduled for Thursday, so Thursday will get you a solid time. What's
[64.73s -> 70.25s]  happening today? Well, I figured we'd just hang out for a little bit, chat and talk about,
[71.86s -> 74.90s]  you know, about my taxes. And maybe you guys can help me with them.
[75.78s -> 79.78s]  Trying to figure out what is and was it is in an expense, you know, it's hard stuff.
[80.50s -> 88.60s]  Now, we're probably gonna play LA Noire and Red Dead 2. And then maybe a little bit of
[89.16s -> 98.79s]  of the new, what was that new? Not Binding of Isaac, whatever it was. Both games? No,
[98.79s -> 109.29s]  I think we're good. Oh, there I am. Oh, hi. Hi, the webcam works. Delta, oh,
[109.29s -> 112.33s]  that Delta rune. That's what it was. Binding of Isaac. Why did I think of Binding of Isaac?
[112.97s -> 118.09s]  Strange. Anyways, we'll just take a minute here. I can turn off the intro.
[119.21s -> 122.25s]  Oh, no, maybe the intro should stay on for a little longer. What do you think?
[123.21s -> 131.46s]  I'm weird about my intros, man. I believe my normal streamers, right? If you're a normal
[131.46s -> 143.66s]  streamer, how long do you have your intro on for? More than five minutes? One minute?
[145.67s -> 155.78s]  30 minutes? 30 minutes? Oh, it's been three minutes. Should I give it five minutes? I don't
[155.78s -> 174.39s]  have any time frame here. 30 seconds. Well, regardless, 10 minutes is good. Five minutes
[174.39s -> 182.94s]  is all right for me, I think. So, I mean, we're at four minutes now. You're always talking
[182.94s -> 186.62s]  before I get the alert and come in. Well, all right, so I need to learn how to do this
[186.62s -> 192.63s]  thing. I need to learn how to stream. So, I hit the start streaming button. But I want
[192.63s -> 199.00s]  people to know that I didn't accidentally press start streaming, you know? We could turn it
[199.00s -> 202.12s]  off. Let's just get to what I want to do. I want to hang out for a little bit.
[205.22s -> 209.78s]  I don't know what this is. This is different. This is like vertical video on a cell phone.
[211.85s -> 216.97s]  And no, there's no green screen back here. Take a look. See, it's not like, oh,
[216.97s -> 224.02s]  he's going to fall through it. This is just, see? This is a wall. This is really a wall.
[224.66s -> 228.92s]  How weird would it be if I was inside of a box inside of a green screen?
[231.80s -> 238.47s]  Well, whatever. I like your Nightwing shirt. I did too. So, today, I just figured we just,
[238.47s -> 244.68s]  we wouldn't really do much. Probably sit around and do it wider. I don't feel like doing it.
[244.68s -> 255.45s]  It's too far away for me. Chill stream. We're just going to hang out, talk, relax.
[256.25s -> 260.95s]  Do you feel a little lazy, you know? Feel a little bit lazy today. That's kind of what
[260.95s -> 269.72s]  we're doing. But LA Noire is on the list. So is Red Dead 2. But we haven't had an opportunity
[269.72s -> 277.99s]  to do this, just to sit here, you know? It hasn't been a very much of an opportunity for
[277.99s -> 290.34s]  us to just kind of hang out here because, I mean, sorry, I've got a little bit of wine
[290.34s -> 300.34s]  here. Don't mind me. This is wine, you know? I only drink wine during one particular type
[300.34s -> 309.75s]  of stream. I'm not sure. That's nice. That's fruity. That's got some notes to it. That's
[309.75s -> 316.58s]  got some blueberry in an oak cask. But, you know, the only time that I ever drink wine
[316.58s -> 326.07s]  on stream is when I'm doing something very particular on camera. Why am I not? Why is
[326.07s -> 334.60s]  it not in a cup? It isn't a cup. But let's speed it up here because I think a lot of
[334.60s -> 338.36s]  people are probably really curious as to what the deal is. I'm going to go ahead and switch
[338.36s -> 342.20s]  it over to LA Noire because that's exactly what we're doing. And we're definitely not
[342.20s -> 367.61s]  doing the Nintendo Labo vehicle kit. Yeah, that's right. We're doing the Labo today.
[369.96s -> 377.86s]  Anytime. Anytime I put wine in a glass. Let's go ahead and put me down here. Down
[377.86s -> 383.54s]  here where I belong in the corner here. Oh, what's that out here? Do you guys
[383.54s -> 397.35s]  hear that? You guys hear that? Oh, okay. Where is it though? It should be here.
[401.78s -> 404.50s]  The best part of both is I was supposed to do this
[405.54s -> 411.94s]  yesterday. You understand? I was supposed to be in the middle of LA Noire and just
[411.94s -> 417.22s]  open this box and start doing it. So you didn't really work out because I
[417.22s -> 422.82s]  there's a couple of problems there. But who gives a shit? Like we're here now and we're
[422.82s -> 428.10s]  going to do it now. I'm excited for it. I know like 60% of the audience is like,
[428.10s -> 444.46s]  I can't believe I'm doing this again. But let's go ahead and open it. I need to move
[444.46s -> 453.85s]  this forward. Whoops. Oh boy, this is a little I don't know how I'm going to like
[453.85s -> 466.01s]  do this. I don't have enough room for this. This is so you guys understand this is like
[466.01s -> 472.39s]  I don't have anything. I can't move. I'm stuck here. You understand like this is locking me
[472.39s -> 486.14s]  in. And the camera's right here. That's good wine too, by the way. Oh, what kind of expensive
[486.14s -> 495.78s]  wine are you drinking tonight? Well, you know, the finest fucking box wine. I gotta
[495.78s -> 502.70s]  be careful with that though. Because like, if that shit like I can't spill any of that.
[503.42s -> 507.02s]  So say goodbye. Honestly, do you think there's gonna be like a spill the fucking wine
[507.02s -> 512.90s]  joke tonight? No, no, no, no, I'm not I know that's not gonna happen. I can't afford that.
[514.02s -> 519.88s]  Anyways, we're gonna just get this fucking thing out of here. Let's do make because
[520.52s -> 530.22s]  I'm ready to go. Am I having problems? Please take a picture of this QR code. There we go.
[530.22s -> 536.06s]  Okay, so I don't know what pieces I need. This is gonna be apparently from all the reviews
[536.06s -> 540.86s]  I read. This is apparently way way more fun. It has the games are actually like three or four
[540.86s -> 545.02s]  times better than I don't know why three or four is the number of new here. Apparently,
[545.02s -> 549.34s]  it's like three times better game wise than the other labos. This is apparently the other
[549.34s -> 555.58s]  labos with dog shit in comparison. So we'll find out. I got my I got my controllers here.
[556.86s -> 563.70s]  Okay, I'm ready. Let's go ahead and make. First, we'll practice. I don't need to practice.
[563.70s -> 566.34s]  I already know how to make the fucking popcorn holder. I don't need to do this.
[567.14s -> 572.86s]  I'm gonna change this from like the from just chatting to Nintendo labo vehicle kit.
[576.41s -> 594.41s]  Vehicle kit. Let lab go. Let's just have a vehicle. Fuck is that person running?
[595.29s -> 603.05s]  How about a making car automobile factory? Well, it's not just cars, vehicle factory.
[604.39s -> 610.68s]  Vehicle factory one worker, right? Because I mean, that would be kind of fucked up. But that's
[610.68s -> 625.72s]  that's reality here. I gotta make them all. Okay, labo. Okay, that's done. I'm ready.
[627.74s -> 632.38s]  This is actually kind of good. This is a red blend California red blend from black box
[632.38s -> 642.81s]  premium box wine. My plan is, you know, to stall. No, don't stall this. This shit
[642.81s -> 647.85s]  takes like eight hours to build. Don't stop stalling. It's gonna be like a nine and a
[647.85s -> 653.61s]  half hour stream. Look at how good I look right now. I look fresh. I look well rested. Fast
[653.61s -> 658.81s]  forward seven and a half hours from now. I bet you my hair is greasy. My face is watery.
[658.81s -> 666.98s]  And like I got stains under my armpits. $50 just came in. Baked flakes. Thank you for
[666.98s -> 674.74s]  the 50 fucking dollars. And he says, italics says you have small cups. How dare you force
[674.74s -> 686.23s]  germicides cups onto your housemates. Eat these bits on stream. This is this is eight ounces.
[687.03s -> 692.15s]  This is a this is what a human being is supposed to consume for a serving. Six to eight ounces.
[693.34s -> 698.86s]  Just stop going to Burger King and getting the large like 38 ounce fucking beverage. It's
[698.86s -> 704.09s]  gonna kill you one day. This is the amount of ounces a waffle one serving. You know,
[704.09s -> 707.85s]  you drink those bottles of water, those are 16.9 fluid ounces. That's two servings.
[708.81s -> 724.68s]  Call a doctor and ask him. Call a doctor. Call a doctor and ask. I don't even think
[724.68s -> 731.74s]  he can hear me. But thanks for the $50 man so much. Seriously. I don't need practice. Thank
[731.74s -> 740.98s]  you baked flakes. It's a lot of money. We already know this part. Okay, that was weird.
[740.98s -> 749.90s]  Go. Go. I already know this part. Is there a way to skip the baby shit? I think we have to
[749.90s -> 759.53s]  do this. Yeah, if you hold this, I don't even need this baby shit. Yeah, hold these and go
[759.53s -> 767.26s]  back and forth. Or baby shit. It's a game for little kids. Actually, one of the reviewers said
[767.26s -> 774.04s]  that it took him and his son a very long time to make it. He said that, you know, it was
[774.04s -> 778.84s]  really hard for me. My son was there too, but I thought it was pretty difficult at points.
[778.84s -> 789.72s]  And I'm like, okay, well, all right. Stop making things up. I swear to God, that's a
[789.72s -> 795.24s]  review for this labo. Just type in labo review me and my son or something and you'll just find
[795.24s -> 805.13s]  it. Do like how people find anything on the internet. You're the father. Congrats.
[809.08s -> 820.44s]  Shave your scruff. Listen, anytime that I shave, I only have to shave like once a week
[820.44s -> 825.00s]  because my face should be grow so slow and so radically thick. And I have sensitive skin,
[825.00s -> 829.96s]  right? I have sensitive teeth. So I need special toothpaste and any special shaving cream
[829.96s -> 835.24s]  because if I shave, I get red and itchy and it's bad. So I have to use sensitive toothpaste
[835.24s -> 840.36s]  for my sensitive teeth and then sensitive soap for my sensitive face. I don't want to shave
[840.36s -> 847.48s]  every day. All right, so we're going to make a petal. 60 to 90 minutes. We're going to be
[847.48s -> 867.27s]  here all day. This is going to take a long fucking time. 90 minutes for just a fucking
[867.27s -> 873.21s]  petal. This is a mistake. This is like, this is a 10 minute joke that I wanted to make
[873.21s -> 880.98s]  and now it's a nine hour stream. Do you have chest? I don't have any chest here.
[881.70s -> 889.14s]  I guess unanimously people, okay. So there's, there's like the before and after labo streams,
[889.14s -> 895.94s]  right? Before labo and during labo, it was okay. But like after labo, it was like,
[895.94s -> 901.86s]  don't ever do that again. So like now, now we're just, now we're going to put on like a
[901.86s -> 911.42s]  high heel. I'm ready. Four steps. You need a complete base petal frame joy con. I've had
[911.42s -> 916.14s]  some practice. I'll be able to get this good. What do I need? And turn this fucking shitty
[916.14s -> 927.03s]  music down, Nintendo. There. Perfect. What was this? This is the best kit. That's what
[927.03s -> 931.19s]  I've been told by the guy that had the sun. The guy that had the sun. I told you.
[933.06s -> 940.18s]  Okay. We need the big, uh, Yoshi face, the big spitter from Jurassic park. That's what that is.
[940.18s -> 951.53s]  That's the, just that look at it. The spitter from Jurassic park. I don't care what anybody
[951.53s -> 955.53s]  says. That's the image that's on the screen. I would, I would have passed like the Rorschach
[955.53s -> 964.07s]  test or where is it a pedal a and it's the, it's the Rorschach, uh, Yoshi face.
[964.95s -> 969.18s]  This is the, looks like the one right here. Now I also need to move some stuff because I
[969.58s -> 976.39s]  can't trash this room. This is not a funny break stuff room because I just bought it.
[976.39s -> 979.54s]  You think I'm going to break it? I'm going to move this
[980.79s -> 988.38s]  sidewards. You know, let's move this, let's move this sidewards. Okay, I guess fine.
[988.38s -> 992.62s]  I want this trash bag. You know, make sure to put the trash bag in the table,
[992.62s -> 999.08s]  like underneath the legs and just drop it under the table. No, that's too much work.
[1000.04s -> 1005.37s]  All right. So I need to punch out, don't ruin these two pieces from sheet A. Don't forget
[1005.37s -> 1009.61s]  the tiny piece on the bottom. So this little thing right here. So how, how does that look?
[1009.61s -> 1014.39s]  Does this need to be adjusted? Let me adjust this camera because it is, it's, uh,
[1014.39s -> 1038.17s]  lights are changing in here. Shit. BenQ, why do you have to have these fucking touch pad
[1038.17s -> 1056.55s]  things? Just put buttons on like a regular fucking company. Okay. Where is it? Is there
[1056.63s -> 1060.49s]  a reason why I can't configure this? What the fuck is going on here?
[1064.33s -> 1069.56s]  Yes, I'd like to configure that video, please. Why the fuck is going on here?
[1070.28s -> 1089.35s]  Why can I not configure? Configure! I just did it. Do I seriously, are you going to piss me off
[1089.35s -> 1094.04s]  this much? I don't even have it on my task bar or anything. I just can't even open the
[1094.04s -> 1102.46s]  fucking Logitech software. What the fuck was that? What the hell was that? My camera just
[1102.46s -> 1116.74s]  got struck by lightning. Configure. Thank you. Jesus. Who runs these companies? All right.
[1116.74s -> 1123.22s]  It looks good. And how's that? That's better, right? You can actually see what's going on here.
[1131.34s -> 1142.09s]  Looks good. Okay. Let's go ahead and do it. That's that camera. That's that one. Move
[1142.09s -> 1151.96s]  this back so I can see it again. All right. BenQ. I have an idea for a great company
[1151.96s -> 1161.80s]  innovation. Instead of buttons, make really finicky touch buttons instead and waste electricity.
[1161.80s -> 1173.51s]  There goes that sponsorship. Hey, okay. Now I can see. Get it out of there.
[1176.87s -> 1186.01s]  60 to 90 minutes and it's already, we've already wasted 20. Is this good? Piece here and then
[1186.01s -> 1194.63s]  the little guy right there, a little dumbbell. Excellent. Make sure to put this in the,
[1194.63s -> 1198.95s]  do it. Don't be lazy about it. Put it in the trash. Well, recycle it because this is
[1198.95s -> 1204.46s]  going to go in the recycling. I don't need anything else from this, right? It comes more
[1204.46s -> 1211.82s]  like length. We have to like fold this shit and like pack it away neatly. Put it in the trash.
[1211.82s -> 1217.99s]  No, this is going into the recycling. Come on, guys. Come on. All right. We got the
[1217.99s -> 1234.74s]  first piece out. Just get like the first few pieces. All right. So we need this one from B.
[1236.95s -> 1249.86s]  So that top one B with the here. So which one is it? B. Is this not the right thing?
[1249.86s -> 1260.33s]  Looks like it is. Why does this look wrong? Oh, it's like a giant treasure map. Okay.
[1262.50s -> 1273.08s]  This one. All right. That's good. Save that for now and let's start the assembling process.
[1274.04s -> 1279.24s]  Kids, don't forget if you have any trouble, you can use the back button. I know how it
[1279.24s -> 1286.10s]  works. So let's get started on this. Oh, the pedal. First up is the big piece here. Make sure
[1287.06s -> 1291.22s]  that you read Family Circus because that's the mother from Family Circus, which no longer is
[1291.22s -> 1294.74s]  even in print anymore. I don't think I think it was discontinued back like two or three years
[1294.74s -> 1299.46s]  ago. But man, it was it was a that was that was a that was in the funnies. All right. Make
[1299.46s -> 1303.78s]  sure you have plenty of space when working on big pieces. It might help to put away tiny
[1303.78s -> 1309.43s]  pieces you don't need. I know how to don't I know how to work this. Thank God that
[1309.43s -> 1320.65s]  comic sucked. Yeah, that comic really? Seriously, like I hate this. I hate to like continue the
[1320.65s -> 1325.69s]  stall here. But I don't even need to stall. But seriously, that comic was just you guys think
[1325.69s -> 1331.21s]  Garfield was bad. Was it Family Circus? Like three panels and it was like boy is out playing.
[1331.93s -> 1338.84s]  Mother calls boy in for dinner. Boy comes in for dinner. That was it. There was no comedy.
[1339.56s -> 1345.74s]  All right, let's go. So we're gonna go this way. Nice increased. All these folds have to
[1345.74s -> 1355.62s]  happen. All of my this is not my first time, man. I just I can't it's too far. I'm just gonna
[1355.62s -> 1364.25s]  put it here for now. We have to vacuum this room. Come in for dinner. Okay. And he comes
[1364.25s -> 1368.49s]  in and he's like chocolate all over his mouth. Did you eat chocolate before coming in for dinner?
[1369.21s -> 1394.82s]  Yeah. The kid looked like Bobby Hill. Like shrunk. Family Circus. Okay, dad. But that
[1394.82s -> 1399.70s]  trope is only happens when you're one or two years old, by the way. No, no, four or five,
[1399.70s -> 1404.18s]  six year old is getting like the giant mouth of chocolate all over their face.
[1404.82s -> 1414.78s]  It doesn't happen. You ready for that satisfying satisfaction? It's been a while since we've
[1414.78s -> 1429.75s]  heard that noise. How about the next one? What is wrong with me? I'm like embarrassed
[1429.75s -> 1436.36s]  right now because I saw the screen. I'm turning red. I saw the webcam. You can't hear it.
[1437.00s -> 1442.71s]  Look at the fucking dickhead in the car. That guy is probably a nice,
[1442.71s -> 1456.55s]  wonderful person. Who cares? So we got one, two, three. Same thing on the other side.
[1462.98s -> 1469.82s]  Is he drunk? I've had the equivalent of drinking like a glass of Welch's grape juice, guys.
[1470.86s -> 1495.59s]  That's not how it works. It's wine. That's not my walnut desk. Shit. Okay, that's all
[1495.59s -> 1503.48s]  right for now. Fuck you. All right, let's go. I got them all folded. Do we get these little
[1503.48s -> 1510.47s]  knobs here? All the little ones too or no? Yeah, I gotta go with the small ones. And then
[1511.51s -> 1522.92s]  bring in the big guy. Here we go. Wicked. Turmoil is never the same after moving to Vegas.
[1526.47s -> 1534.09s]  The Labo stream was like three or four months ago. The first one. So it came with me.
[1534.73s -> 1539.93s]  And the best part is I don't have to like destroy these. I can put these on, I'm gonna put them on
[1539.93s -> 1545.37s]  a shelf when I get like some of these, the pedal done. This is, this like size eight shoe
[1545.37s -> 1549.69s]  is going up on a shelf up here. I don't have to get rid of it. I don't have to like recycle it.
[1551.13s -> 1557.45s]  I recycle, yeah. Fucking problem with that. All right, over here. These have to punch out.
[1562.65s -> 1565.21s]  I'm just gonna say fuck it in a vacuum later. That's just the way it is.
[1566.01s -> 1580.36s]  Can we have a joke please? All right. Like you mean like a knock-knock type joke? What do you
[1580.36s -> 1584.52s]  mean like a story? Look at, look at how funny this story was. What? Did you, you didn't see
[1584.52s -> 1606.98s]  that part coming in the middle? Which kind? Anything. Okay. How about knock-knock is there.
[1609.78s -> 1625.69s]  It's, it's the police. Police who? Open up. You are, you killed somebody. Now you're under
[1625.69s -> 1637.16s]  arrest. We know the body's in the fridge. All right. So wait, wait, wait. Let me get this
[1637.16s -> 1646.81s]  right. Like that, right? Okay. And this part comes down, snaps into place, and then this one
[1646.81s -> 1651.29s]  folds. Okay, that's what this little one's for. Let's, let's go. Oh, I'm sorry little one.
[1654.74s -> 1665.94s]  Connect from here to here. Right. And good. Make sure it's snug. Oh, this is way better
[1665.94s -> 1672.62s]  than, this is way better than the other two. This is way better. Sorry. This one folds,
[1672.62s -> 1681.32s]  right? Where's that? Over here. This sticks into the, it's going to go in that slot right
[1681.32s -> 1688.87s]  there. Guarantee. I fucking guarantee it. Watch this. In she goes. Right in here.
[1689.85s -> 1696.63s]  Sunny side up. Can you guys see? I'm going to make sure the class, you guys are following
[1696.63s -> 1702.50s]  along, right? See the thing is, one of you guys got this for your birthday like a month ago
[1702.50s -> 1704.74s]  and you were like, holy shit, I'm never going to use that. But you're like, oh,
[1704.74s -> 1709.54s]  thanks grandma. It's been rotting in your closet for like two or three months.
[1710.34s -> 1714.34s]  And, but then you saw this stream turned on and you fucking sprinted as fast as you could to go
[1714.34s -> 1719.78s]  to the closet and grab it and like do it with me. Three of you did that. Okay. Beautiful.
[1719.78s -> 1724.54s]  Let's put these connected pieces to one side for a moment. Why would I need to take a break?
[1726.73s -> 1732.95s]  Take a break. All right. Well, there it is. Put, put two things together. What's,
[1732.95s -> 1738.39s]  what is Nintendo's obsession with breaks? Look, if I want to drink a box of wine
[1738.39s -> 1743.59s]  and play with a children's toy, I'm going to, I'm going to do that. Okay. Don't worry about me.
[1743.59s -> 1748.74s]  I'm going to be just fine. Like it's like Wii sports all over again. Are you sure there's
[1748.74s -> 1753.38s]  enough room? No, I'm not sure. I'm going to ruin my house. I'm going to start smashing stuff.
[1753.38s -> 1756.34s]  I'm going to break the vases and I'm going to break a couple of windows. I wasn't sure.
[1756.34s -> 1763.13s]  Thanks for reminding me. Okay. So you did these from C. Did they do that because they think
[1763.13s -> 1768.10s]  someone's going to sue them? You got to say, Hey, make sure you don't break any windows in
[1768.10s -> 1775.13s]  your house with the wii mode. Well, people would sort of actually do that. Can you imagine
[1775.13s -> 1783.11s]  if you like threw your wii mode into your TV and you were like, Nintendo did that?
[1783.11s -> 1790.57s]  What the fuck, Nintendo? Why'd you do that? You're going to waste the energy to call
[1790.57s -> 1794.82s]  and like get a lawyer. You're going to get a lawyer. Imagine explaining that to the lawyer.
[1795.62s -> 1801.06s]  Oh, yes. This is a PD Richards and sons. How can I help you? Hey,
[1801.06s -> 1807.38s]  I whipped a fucking heavy object into my TV and broke it and the company that sold me the thing.
[1808.02s -> 1832.52s]  I want to sue them. Hello. These two. All right. Is that all we need? Just,
[1832.52s -> 1836.84s]  just these one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four. Sorry. And this counted.
[1838.31s -> 1841.98s]  That's it, right? Thing is I don't want to get rid of these just yet because I need,
[1841.98s -> 1846.14s]  I need to track them down later. I had so much fun. God, I miss this.
[1847.02s -> 1850.78s]  You will need the rest of the pieces and see later. Is the music too loud? I'm turning it down.
[1855.14s -> 1865.58s]  Sort of like a pair of spoons, aren't they? I mean, no. Spoon. These are spoons.
[1869.90s -> 1878.66s]  Sort of like a pair of spoons. Okay. I'll flip them over to the other backs. Have you got
[1878.66s -> 1882.74s]  them facing the right way? I don't know. You just said they were spoons. How can I trust you
[1882.74s -> 1896.44s]  ever again? Okay. So now they're facing the right way. Fold them up. Wait, I gotta take,
[1896.44s -> 1904.39s]  I gotta take care of this. I love the people that are trickling into the stream right now.
[1905.19s -> 1921.42s]  I just looked over at the chat and I saw not this again. Oh yeah. Make sure you, hey,
[1921.42s -> 1926.54s]  make sure you grab yourself a box wine. If you're at least the age of drinking in your
[1926.54s -> 1931.42s]  particular region or time zone. Drinking is by time zone. Specific time is allowed to start
[1931.42s -> 1938.14s]  drinking at five, four, five PM. Eastern time is not allowed to start drinking until
[1938.14s -> 1945.46s]  like five PM Eastern, which is, you know, it's by time zone. It's three 30 in the afternoon,
[1945.46s -> 1967.88s]  his Pacific. Oh yeah, it is. You know, like tons of information is racing through my brain
[1967.88s -> 1974.18s]  right now. Literally everything I've ever done is like racing through my mind. I just like,
[1974.18s -> 1978.18s]  I just had a vision of me doing this and being like, holy shit, what a weirdo.
[1985.66s -> 1993.53s]  He's having, I'm having a crisis right now. It's happening. I'm too self-aware. I need to like
[1993.53s -> 1998.57s]  install like the 2013 German emulator and like run it in a virtual machine in my brain
[1998.57s -> 2010.81s]  because I'm like, I'm, what the fuck is happening right now? Old age. All right.
[2010.81s -> 2022.97s]  Wait, hold, hold this. I'm not breaking it. Was it a break? It's designed to be folded.
[2023.53s -> 2035.62s]  Half a glass of wine and already drunk. Listen, buddy, that ain't how it works.
[2037.67s -> 2044.15s]  Back in my heyday, I could drink this whole box and puke and be sick. And it was awful.
[2044.15s -> 2049.35s]  And it was never fun. It sucked every time. Don't fucking do it. It's not cool to drink too
[2049.35s -> 2053.27s]  much to the point where you fucking black out and get sick. Don't, it's not fucking fun.
[2053.27s -> 2066.58s]  Don't do it. All right. I need to, this could take like all day. I had this vision
[2066.58s -> 2070.18s]  in my brain that this was not going to take this long. Where's that piece?
[2071.14s -> 2083.34s]  He's at the fold up like that. Okay. Same thing with the other one. This is hard to do.
[2083.34s -> 2093.06s]  I'm sure I'm just seeing things. No, just don't, just, just be, just know your limits.
[2093.62s -> 2098.17s]  If your, if your limit is a box of wine, know it, know what it is.
[2104.57s -> 2110.09s]  Violent boomer destroys Nintendo Labo. Ah, I don't see anything destroyed at the moment. I
[2110.09s -> 2119.27s]  see a lot of, um, well-crafted, nice, very taking my time boomer playing with the Nintendo Labo.
[2123.45s -> 2125.93s]  So then these go through here. This is going to turn into like a little grill.
[2130.18s -> 2142.95s]  These fold, fold both of them. One is elf bowling. Just, you're going to have to get
[2142.95s -> 2153.42s]  the emulator for that one. Remember they're going to destroy this one like the piano.
[2153.42s -> 2157.66s]  No, I destroyed the piano because I didn't like the piano. Okay.
[2161.05s -> 2167.56s]  I like this one. Time to start putting everything together. Stand up with a bit like this.
[2170.17s -> 2173.05s]  What if you don't like that? I'm going to like this one. I already read the reviews.
[2175.13s -> 2180.97s]  Will you let me pay attention? So this one has to go. I like, this is cool. So this one
[2180.97s -> 2189.58s]  sticks in there like this, like that. That feels actually really nice. What a piece of shit.
[2194.26s -> 2202.18s]  All right. Looks good. Flip it around. It is all the, it is satisfying. It is.
[2202.98s -> 2208.33s]  Flip the whole thing over and we've got someone looks like to be at the twin.
[2208.33s -> 2215.77s]  It goes in here like this, right? Did somebody? No. Somebody gave money though.
[2217.45s -> 2229.59s]  $10 just came in from Shpee. Shpee shawl. Thank you for the 10 bucks, man. That's cool.
[2230.15s -> 2248.58s]  We need to, I need some more light. Don't you just see my information?
[2259.66s -> 2274.60s]  That's too much. And you will rise with the sun. No, that's, you can't see anything.
[2274.60s -> 2280.79s]  I just needed to point this way for a second. That's that one. All right. That looks okay.
[2283.93s -> 2290.28s]  That was a, that was not what I wanted to do. Like there. What is this? What is this? What is
[2290.28s -> 2305.02s]  this for? What is this for? What, what is this for? I don't know what this is for.
[2305.58s -> 2309.38s]  What do you do with this thing? It just sits there and looks nice for a second.
[2319.11s -> 2328.06s]  The box line is in the way. That's the problem. I'm like at a campfire.
[2328.94s -> 2333.74s]  Oh, forget it. It looks, it's fine. Crack this open a little bit. Just give me a second
[2333.74s -> 2364.30s]  because it's like, it's too dark right here. There. Incoming joke. Nope. Incoming more light
[2364.30s -> 2367.98s]  so you can see. But I need to turn that off. I don't, I don't know what Phillips, you need to,
[2367.98s -> 2372.02s]  I need to ask somebody at Phillips a question. You've got a great product here.
[2373.27s -> 2386.22s]  Why am I so concerned about this? Like don't look at my password. Like what are you hiding?
[2386.78s -> 2398.86s]  Okay. That's better. All right. Back to it. Where's this going to go? Right here. That's
[2398.86s -> 2407.77s]  fine. Needed more light. All right. Those are both on. Let's check everything's properly
[2407.77s -> 2412.25s]  in place. Are your pieces neatly lined up like this? Yes, they are. Now we need from sheet B.
[2413.21s -> 2422.57s]  Wherever the hell, wherever the hell that is. This is sheet B. Show you taxes.
[2426.31s -> 2433.85s]  So I don't think, I don't think so. So we need the little M's. So we need one, two, three.
[2442.58s -> 2452.26s]  Build me a waifu. Well, this is a pedal. I don't, I don't think that's what you're asking
[2452.26s -> 2461.98s]  for. I'm sorry. Let's go. It's a fan blade triplets labeled one, two, three, and they're
[2461.98s -> 2468.25s]  eager to join our slot party. Good thing we've got some more slots along the big pieces. Okay.
[2468.25s -> 2472.17s]  So I'm assuming we're going to go one, two, three. I know how to do this. It's going to go
[2472.17s -> 2496.09s]  bang, bang, bang. Look at that. Beautiful. So bang, two, bang. Yeah. Look at that.
[2496.09s -> 2522.47s]  Look at that. Okay. Gift subs. Oh shit. Pocket Pondling has gifted five community subs. Cheers
[2522.47s -> 2529.46s]  to that, man. Thank you. Thanks to the five gifted community subs. You're the man.
[2529.46s -> 2539.19s]  Congratulations to those five lucky contestants. Finally bring back the pieces we started off
[2539.19s -> 2545.78s]  with. This thing. Get that over here. And this is going to be the guts. This is going
[2545.78s -> 2560.58s]  to be the real guts. Oh, this is popping out. Oh, fuck. Somebody. Okay. Matters of
[2560.58s -> 2565.18s]  Darkness. Thanks for the five community subs. We've got 10 gifted subs here from
[2565.18s -> 2573.69s]  Pocket Pondling and Matters of Darkness. Thank you both. Big subs coming in. Thank
[2573.69s -> 2581.82s]  you guys a lot. More gifts. You can't. Come on. They're gifts. All right. So lay them
[2581.82s -> 2585.98s]  out flat and place our slotty structure on top. It's a little tab. Should fit right into
[2585.98s -> 2598.71s]  the middle holes. What the hell are you talking about? Right here. Okay. That sticks just in.
[2599.83s -> 2623.91s]  Does it though? This tab is poking out. Those are in. As in as they can be. Okay. Looks just
[2623.91s -> 2630.18s]  like the on the box on the picture. Now fold it all up. This is the part that I love.
[2630.98s -> 2635.62s]  This is why you are all watching. To see this right here. This the skeleton closing
[2635.62s -> 2662.76s]  it over the muscles. The bone marrow, I mean. There you go. You ready? How many people would
[2662.76s -> 2669.00s]  have just left if I did that? You think? That was very satisfying. Okay. So then there's the
[2669.00s -> 2676.38s]  base pedal. Beginning to look like a proper base. Now grab this piece. The little hand glider
[2677.46s -> 2700.14s]  from B. This one. Ah, okay. There it is. See the labo writing on it. So that one,
[2700.14s -> 2708.33s]  let's punch that out. Okay. Okay. That was inherently satisfying. It was.
[2708.89s -> 2715.66s]  Here's a pro tip. Skip. All of it is going to fall. Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold. Up,
[2715.66s -> 2718.30s]  up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. And then it's going to go in.
[2719.26s -> 2727.99s]  How does it go in? This is the part where he fucks it up. No, I got to get the camera
[2727.99s -> 2736.07s]  in a good spot after this because this is like, we're making a car. You better believe
[2736.07s -> 2745.70s]  I'm going to bring this to the green screen stream as a wheel and like a pedal. I'm gonna
[2745.70s -> 2752.66s]  gonna have a wheel in my hands. Okay, so that's that. This is a bird. This is
[2752.66s -> 2764.71s]  gonna be a petal at the moment. Alright, where does it go? So this part turns
[2764.71s -> 2768.95s]  this way so you can see inside, and then flip the whole cover piece and we're
[2768.95s -> 2776.29s]  ready to get constructing. Like that. And then that goes, first is up with the
[2776.29s -> 2782.02s]  two tabs. The tops lie them both in at once. Like that. Okay, let me get
[2782.02s -> 2799.79s]  this folded. What about back here though? They all fold up. Okay, this is the part
[2799.79s -> 2806.70s]  where he fucks it up. Not quite. Not yet at least. Okay, then the bottom tab goes
[2806.70s -> 2820.01s]  in. Slide it. Snap. And then side to side. Easy enough. Okay. Wait for the
[2820.01s -> 2825.64s]  crunch. Wait for the crunch. Oh, that was a little too much of a crunch.
[2825.64s -> 2840.88s]  Alright. Done. Ruined. I didn't ruin it. What are you talking about? It's perfect. Lo and
[2840.88s -> 2846.35s]  behold, we've completed the base of the petal. Alright, thanks everybody for
[2846.35s -> 2849.71s]  watching. That's gonna be the end of the labo segment of the stream. Now we're
[2849.71s -> 2859.55s]  gonna go on to part two. Oh, make sure you got your dongle bag. I gotta get the
[2859.55s -> 2868.29s]  dongle bag up here. So wait, what do I need? What pieces? Part two of 183.
[2868.29s -> 2871.65s]  Okay, making the actual petal. Make sure you've got the special dongle part
[2871.65s -> 2875.17s]  bag. You don't have to open it yet. Just know where it is. Okay, that's
[2875.17s -> 2878.85s]  fine. I know where it is. Remove this one piece. This is a big one.
[2879.41s -> 2893.12s]  Almost there. By the way, this is a game in itself. If I spill wine on the ground
[2893.12s -> 2898.32s]  tier, I lost a lot of money. So, like, just keep... That's a game,
[2898.32s -> 2917.41s]  essentially. What the... Pocket Polly just gave 10 community subs. Pocket
[2917.41s -> 2927.89s]  Polly coming in with 10. Holy shit. That's a lot of money. Well,
[2927.89s -> 2931.49s]  congratulations to the 10 people that got this massive amount of community
[2931.49s -> 2934.77s]  subs given away by Pocket Polly and others in Matters of Darkness as well.
[2937.02s -> 2946.18s]  That's a lot. Thank you, dude. So what is the... Is there any criteria to get
[2946.18s -> 2952.83s]  the random sub? Or is it just... You just get it randomly. Someone in the
[2952.83s -> 2961.58s]  chat does. It just happens. Damn. You just can't be subbed. Okay.
[2963.86s -> 2969.87s]  That's pretty cool. I didn't really know how it worked. You probably have
[2969.87s -> 2973.31s]  to be following. I mean, I don't have any settings set up like that if
[2973.31s -> 2978.51s]  they exist. Whatever they are, they're a default. But thank you, dude. Thanks
[2978.51s -> 2984.48s]  so much for your massive amount of subs that you've just gifted. So we got
[2984.48s -> 2995.44s]  this piece. I'm going to give 10 more. Hold on. What are you doing? Oh my
[2995.44s -> 3003.78s]  God. There's another 10. There it is. 10. That's 20 community subs from
[3003.78s -> 3011.15s]  Pocket Polly. Holy shit. I'm going to put this out of the way for now
[3011.15s -> 3013.23s]  because we've got another piece here that we need to work with. But damn
[3013.23s -> 3020.34s]  Pocket Polly. At the end of the day, thank you, man. Like, that's
[3021.06s -> 3030.72s]  that's a lot. Is it 26 now? Well, congratulations to the lucky
[3031.52s -> 3042.78s]  double dozen here. Oh, he bought the actual labo this time. I had the
[3042.78s -> 3048.82s]  other labos before. I just did... I did the pizza thing because it
[3048.82s -> 3053.98s]  worked. That'll be good. Well, there's a couple more little tabs.
[3055.82s -> 3061.10s]  You know what? I have one complaint about the labo. Can you pre-tab it?
[3061.34s -> 3065.58s]  Can you pre-punch tabs? I mean, I know it's a bit cheeky and oh no,
[3065.58s -> 3069.50s]  but it's fun to like punch out the little tabs. It just makes a mess.
[3069.50s -> 3071.90s]  I already got enough for cycling. Now I got to find all these little
[3071.90s -> 3077.66s]  bits and pieces. Oh my Lord.
[3084.77s -> 3094.19s]  Ragharnoi. Ragharnoi just gave out 10 community subs. 10 from
[3095.15s -> 3104.61s]  Ragharnoi. Thank you so much, dude. Oh dear. That's like 40 subs in.
[3104.61s -> 3109.01s]  That's like 50 subs almost in like fucking 10 minutes. I better make
[3109.01s -> 3123.97s]  like a good stream. Jesus, man. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[3127.66s -> 3133.55s]  That's a lot of money and a lot of people. You guys are fucking awesome.
[3133.55s -> 3136.53s]  Thanks. Hopefully you're having a good time.
[3139.50s -> 3142.30s]  Let's head back into this. Then I'm already getting like greasy.
[3143.26s -> 3146.14s]  All right. Folds. All of them. I know they're everywhere.
[3146.14s -> 3151.15s]  All right. So fold everything. Oh my God.
[3153.97s -> 3158.99s]  Are you guys having a gift sub fight? That's 10 from Multi Trip.
[3164.08s -> 3170.38s]  Holy shit. I don't know what to do about this.
[3170.38s -> 3173.10s]  Like Rampaging Scrub, five. Multi Trip, 10.
[3173.82s -> 3176.61s]  Rampaging Scrub, five. Time for slime, five.
[3181.36s -> 3187.90s]  Five, five, five. This is madness.
[3189.31s -> 3190.67s]  Madness, darkness, another five.
[3198.37s -> 3204.05s]  Oh, whoa. All right. Hold on a second. Hold on a second.
[3204.05s -> 3207.57s]  That was just 20. I saw 20 from Kairatobi.
[3207.57s -> 3212.42s]  Kairatobi just gave 20 community subs. Madness, darkness just gave another five.
[3213.06s -> 3229.98s]  Oh, like dude, it's like drink. Okay. Thank you all for so much.
[3229.98s -> 3235.09s]  I thank you. I hope you think it's worth it.
[3236.77s -> 3238.29s]  That was like fucking almost 100 people.
[3255.49s -> 3261.06s]  InstaGator just gave out five. Thank you InstaGator for your five.
[3261.14s -> 3266.50s]  Kairatobi, 20. Thank you so much, everybody.
[3268.72s -> 3271.68s]  Such concludes the gifted sub portion.
[3279.34s -> 3281.98s]  It blows my mind all the time, guys. Like seriously.
[3292.13s -> 3299.09s]  That's five from Jamie. Jamie2803. Throwing the hat into the party here.
[3300.90s -> 3306.78s]  Five more from Jamie. Speech, speech.
[3307.97s -> 3313.20s]  I don't have a speech. I just hope that the next year that you watch
[3314.16s -> 3319.34s]  you think is worth the money. I hope the next month, the next 30 days you watch
[3319.34s -> 3322.70s]  you think is worth it because obviously it's every 30 days.
[3322.70s -> 3326.22s]  And if you don't think it's fun anymore after 30 days,
[3327.65s -> 3330.56s]  then you should not pay me money. You know what I mean?
[3334.99s -> 3342.48s]  I can't, I just can't believe that people, that's 10 from Visual Warlock.
[3342.48s -> 3350.82s]  Thank you for the 10 community subs. Thank you so much, dude.
[3351.62s -> 3360.69s]  Thank you, all of you. 10 fucking subs, 5 subs, 20 subs, 10 subs, 10 subs.
[3360.69s -> 3365.20s]  That's a lot of money. I think sometimes it gets like lost.
[3365.20s -> 3368.77s]  You know what I mean? Like just how much of money that is to give to somebody.
[3369.81s -> 3371.73s]  Ramshackle gave out, giving out five here.
[3375.25s -> 3378.77s]  Thank you so much, dude. Thank you Ramshackle for your five community subs.
[3383.55s -> 3387.23s]  Thank you, everybody. Like I'm essentially speechless at the moment
[3387.23s -> 3394.64s]  because every time something like this happens, it's like, it's a weird feeling.
[3397.66s -> 3402.61s]  Another five from, from Vertibral Giant.
[3405.50s -> 3407.50s]  We're getting, this is, this is definitely over 100.
[3410.37s -> 3412.69s]  Am I doing this right? Am I doing the level correct?
[3415.94s -> 3418.26s]  I just saw somebody was angry because of this.
[3419.06s -> 3421.90s]  I'm sorry. I, I don't want you to be angry.
[3422.62s -> 3425.10s]  I want you to have fun.
[3427.86s -> 3429.94s]  You guys are fucking, this is like ridiculous.
[3435.66s -> 3437.90s]  Oh, the gifted subs are stalling.
[3442.86s -> 3445.42s]  Oh no. Oh my God.
[3454.88s -> 3456.96s]  Pocket Pauling just give a hundred dollars right now.
[3456.96s -> 3458.88s]  A hundred bucks. One hundred dollars.
[3458.88s -> 3459.92s]  You'll see it in a second.
[3459.92s -> 3462.64s]  There's so many subs coming through Streamlabs.
[3462.64s -> 3463.92s]  They can't even like keep up, I don't think.
[3465.74s -> 3466.38s]  Holy shit.
[3469.30s -> 3473.46s]  Well, Pocket Pauling, that's, you've, you've dumped at least two to plus three
[3473.46s -> 3474.66s]  hundred dollars right now.
[3476.74s -> 3477.86s]  Thank you for the hundred dollars here.
[3477.86s -> 3481.30s]  Hey, Jeremy, it was my birthday yesterday and I got cash.
[3481.30s -> 3485.70s]  So I thought I would be cash money of me to gift subs with the money I got.
[3486.34s -> 3487.38s]  Thank you for being a positive force.
[3487.38s -> 3489.38s]  And also thank you for drinking box wine on stream.
[3489.38s -> 3490.18s]  It's validation.
[3491.22s -> 3492.66s]  And, and I support you.
[3497.79s -> 3498.91s]  Cheers, man. Happy birthday.
[3501.20s -> 3502.16s]  I hope you had a good one.
[3504.16s -> 3509.86s]  I, I'm shocked and honored and I don't, I, every kind of emotion that you
[3509.86s -> 3511.78s]  would want to give me your blank birthday money, dude.
[3511.78s -> 3513.38s]  Like I, thank you.
[3514.48s -> 3515.60s]  I, I hope you had a good time.
[3515.60s -> 3517.36s]  I hope you were taken care of and I hope you took care of yourself.
[3522.64s -> 3523.28s]  Much love to you.
[3525.30s -> 3526.42s]  Because that's a lot of fucking money.
[3526.82s -> 3533.47s]  Um, and don't ever forget that because like I was about to say, it gets lost
[3533.47s -> 3538.03s]  sometimes like, oh, like 10 bucks, 20 bucks, like two dollars, one dollar,
[3538.03s -> 3539.87s]  one dollar, 20 bucks, a hundred bucks, a hundred bucks, a hundred bucks.
[3540.75s -> 3545.66s]  It gets lost in like a river and in a lot of cases.
[3545.66s -> 3547.34s]  And I really don't want that to ever be the case.
[3548.30s -> 3551.28s]  So I hope you never feel that that's the case.
[3552.16s -> 3558.14s]  But it, you throw your money in a river.
[3559.10s -> 3560.70s]  No, I hope you know what I mean by that.
[3561.50s -> 3565.10s]  But happy fucking birthday to you, pocket polling.
[3565.74s -> 3568.13s]  I hope it was a great one.
[3571.68s -> 3582.05s]  But anyways, thank you for, thank you for just like giving me a guy on the internet.
[3582.69s -> 3585.89s]  Like right now, like four or $500 probably right there, whatever that was.
[3586.61s -> 3588.08s]  I will put it to good use.
[3588.08s -> 3588.56s]  I promise.
[3590.42s -> 3590.98s]  I promise.
[3591.94s -> 3595.23s]  So, uh, why, where were we here?
[3602.18s -> 3604.26s]  Going, we'll go into more box wine.
[3604.26s -> 3605.14s]  That's, that's correct.
[3605.86s -> 3608.26s]  So we've got all these pieces, all these things.
[3610.99s -> 3612.19s]  Everything needs to be folded.
[3612.19s -> 3612.67s]  I got those.
[3612.67s -> 3613.15s]  I got this.
[3613.15s -> 3613.87s]  I got this one.
[3614.83s -> 3618.11s]  So then where does this go in the grand scheme of things here?
[3618.11s -> 3618.75s]  Did I get that?
[3618.75s -> 3619.15s]  I did.
[3619.95s -> 3622.51s]  Hey, remove the five piece from sheet B.
[3623.39s -> 3625.71s]  So sheet B only has one more piece after this.
[3625.71s -> 3629.39s]  And it's the weird like toaster looking thing in the bottom right.
[3630.90s -> 3632.02s]  Celebratory dab.
[3635.30s -> 3635.86s]  Fine.
[3635.86s -> 3643.55s]  That initiated notes for a second.
[3643.55s -> 3659.95s]  The madman.
[3660.67s -> 3662.19s]  He's gone crazy.
[3662.99s -> 3665.33s]  Wow.
[3665.33s -> 3666.21s]  You stopped drinking.
[3666.21s -> 3667.17s]  What a lightweight.
[3667.17s -> 3670.53s]  I just filled it like not even 10 minutes, five minutes ago.
[3671.41s -> 3675.74s]  Do you know how many, how many glasses of wine are in this fucking box of wine?
[3677.38s -> 3678.10s]  29.
[3678.66s -> 3679.22s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3679.22s -> 3682.42s]  That's 29 wine enthusiasts say this is their best buy award.
[3683.30s -> 3686.00s]  There's three liters in here.
[3686.64s -> 3689.78s]  Nintendo Davo.
[3690.50s -> 3694.61s]  Jesus.
[3695.33s -> 3696.14s]  All right.
[3696.14s -> 3697.34s]  Got these five pieces.
[3697.34s -> 3698.14s]  Flip it over.
[3698.14s -> 3702.51s]  Of course, rip all these little knobs out.
[3706.72s -> 3708.00s]  Compact liters.
[3708.88s -> 3709.76s]  Three liters.
[3710.72s -> 3712.24s]  Derma has a strong neck.
[3715.26s -> 3717.26s]  I don't, my neck always hurts.
[3717.26s -> 3718.06s]  Is that what that means?
[3721.23s -> 3722.83s]  The $400 dab.
[3723.79s -> 3727.55s]  Three liters is two glasses.
[3727.55s -> 3730.27s]  Three liters is like 20 glasses of wine.
[3730.27s -> 3731.39s]  Like at least 15.
[3732.35s -> 3733.76s]  So then this folds in half.
[3734.48s -> 3736.40s]  And then all these stick in the middle here.
[3736.40s -> 3736.72s]  Okay.
[3736.80s -> 3749.02s]  So pocketpalling just gave another $50.
[3753.68s -> 3757.28s]  Thank you for the $50 on top of all the other huge amount of money
[3757.28s -> 3757.92s]  that you've given today.
[3757.92s -> 3758.96s]  Pocketpalling.
[3758.96s -> 3759.44s]  50 bucks.
[3759.44s -> 3760.64s]  Thanks for the birthday wishes, everyone.
[3760.64s -> 3762.24s]  Also, Derma, please don't make yourself sick.
[3762.24s -> 3765.68s]  I'm drinking box wine right now, but that doesn't mean you should.
[3765.68s -> 3767.04s]  Sorry for giving more money.
[3770.58s -> 3772.18s]  Don't, you don't, don't apologize.
[3772.18s -> 3773.86s]  Just, I appreciate it.
[3773.86s -> 3774.34s]  I really do.
[3775.14s -> 3779.52s]  I hope you know that he's, he's drunk.
[3779.52s -> 3782.88s]  He's drunk and donating two things you never want to do.
[3782.88s -> 3783.84s]  Drunk and donate.
[3786.16s -> 3786.96s]  Oh my God.
[3786.96s -> 3789.12s]  People are like giving money now saying like, sorry.
[3792.69s -> 3793.81s]  Somebody stop him.
[3794.94s -> 3795.44s]  No.
[3799.26s -> 3802.90s]  That's okay.
[3802.90s -> 3803.86s]  Just I'm drinking.
[3803.86s -> 3805.14s]  We're drinking box wine together.
[3806.18s -> 3807.78s]  It's a box wine kind of day.
[3807.78s -> 3810.66s]  It's always a, this is like, guys, this is so cheap too.
[3810.66s -> 3812.98s]  You don't have to go buy the most expensive bullshit.
[3812.98s -> 3814.74s]  People go, but here, cheap doesn't mean bad.
[3815.46s -> 3819.97s]  You could go buy Fireball and that's bad, right?
[3819.97s -> 3821.09s]  We all agree on that.
[3821.17s -> 3827.25s]  But like a box of wine, it's like, this is like $17, but like six days worth of alcohol.
[3827.97s -> 3829.28s]  All right.
[3829.28s -> 3830.16s]  What do I do with these?
[3830.88s -> 3835.86s]  This is, this tastes good.
[3835.86s -> 3837.06s]  This is, this is, this is good.
[3837.70s -> 3839.46s]  I'll give it a stamp.
[3839.46s -> 3841.62s]  Black box premium wines, the red blend.
[3842.86s -> 3843.66s]  That's, it's good.
[3844.30s -> 3846.80s]  If you, if they're watching right now, why would they be?
[3846.80s -> 3848.96s]  It's not like a, this is not a video game.
[3848.96s -> 3850.56s]  This is not like a game.
[3850.56s -> 3852.32s]  Oh, the dev is watching right now.
[3852.32s -> 3854.96s]  Why am I that much of a fucking ego maniac?
[3854.96s -> 3857.84s]  Like, oh yeah, you know, black box is probably watching right now.
[3858.40s -> 3858.64s]  What?
[3858.64s -> 3861.68s]  This is like 2,900, but there's like 50 trillion people on earth.
[3861.68s -> 3866.56s]  You think like the black box fucking wine smeller is watching this right now?
[3866.56s -> 3869.79s]  But yeah, red blends are always the best.
[3869.79s -> 3870.75s]  Always buy a red blend.
[3870.75s -> 3872.59s]  If you don't like red, you'll probably like a red blend.
[3878.08s -> 3879.52s]  Wait, what?
[3879.52s -> 3884.51s]  This is just a money stream for, okay.
[3887.07s -> 3898.16s]  First of all, Boston, Boston game gave $55 and 50 cents, $55.
[3898.88s -> 3902.50s]  They just say, sorry, don't say sorry.
[3902.50s -> 3903.06s]  Thank you.
[3903.06s -> 3904.74s]  Boston game for the huge amount of fucking money.
[3905.38s -> 3909.54s]  And then RT, RT game crowd came in with a hundred bucks.
[3914.74s -> 3915.14s]  Thank you.
[3915.14s -> 3921.55s]  RT game crowd, a hundred bucks just to make sure you don't recover emotionally.
[3922.35s -> 3924.43s]  But for real, thanks for the years of content, man.
[3924.43s -> 3928.35s]  You're my all time favorite creator and a massive influence on my own content
[3928.35s -> 3930.75s]  and wanting to drop a hundred on you for ages.
[3930.75s -> 3932.51s]  Go get yourself some more wine and cardboard.
[3937.02s -> 3939.90s]  Thank you, RT.
[3940.94s -> 3942.38s]  That's insane to hear that.
[3946.40s -> 3947.76s]  You're doing a great fucking job, dude.
[3949.04s -> 3950.32s]  Like, you really are.
[3951.55s -> 3954.75s]  Those of you that don't know who RT is, he's fucking killing it.
[3954.75s -> 3955.55s]  You're doing great, man.
[3956.80s -> 3958.16s]  I'm more than happy for you, for real.
[3961.70s -> 3965.23s]  But is Jerma okay?
[3965.31s -> 3965.87s]  I'm fine.
[3965.87s -> 3967.79s]  I'm like, I'm very happy right now.
[3968.91s -> 3970.59s]  How could I be not happy right now?
[3973.74s -> 3975.10s]  But thank you so much.
[3977.52s -> 3979.65s]  That's amazing to hear.
[3982.05s -> 3985.73s]  I just got like $700 in 25 minutes.
[3986.37s -> 3989.04s]  I'm kind of like, I don't really know what to do.
[3991.71s -> 4000.32s]  I hope you guys, look, I say it a lot, but this here, this,
[4001.46s -> 4004.90s]  no, this is, this is, this, this is number one.
[4005.62s -> 4008.58s]  Nothing else takes place of number one, except for my dog.
[4010.16s -> 4011.84s]  And like, I don't know, like my mother.
[4014.88s -> 4019.04s]  And like, I don't know, maybe like my girlfriends up there, like number one.
[4022.59s -> 4023.55s]  My health.
[4023.55s -> 4024.91s]  So maybe not number one.
[4024.91s -> 4029.07s]  You're probably like number like four, but you're like in the top five, right?
[4029.07s -> 4029.55s]  Under mom.
[4029.55s -> 4030.91s]  You guys are under mom, right?
[4030.91s -> 4031.71s]  That's a pretty big deal.
[4036.16s -> 4041.31s]  We're number four in the top five.
[4044.70s -> 4049.44s]  But all jokes aside, the only thing I care about with this stream
[4049.44s -> 4050.80s]  is making sure that people have fun.
[4050.80s -> 4052.64s]  And if you don't, then I hope you tell me.
[4053.44s -> 4056.10s]  Like right now, like I'm sure people are like,
[4056.10s -> 4058.34s]  this probably leads to a thousand people here that are going like,
[4059.22s -> 4061.26s]  you're going to build the fucking thing, dude?
[4061.26s -> 4062.30s]  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, just wait.
[4062.30s -> 4063.18s]  I'm going, I'm trying.
[4064.43s -> 4069.01s]  But for real, you guys mean a lot to me.
[4069.01s -> 4071.84s]  The stream does the whole thing does.
[4071.84s -> 4074.96s]  So I've never thought differently and I never will.
[4074.96s -> 4080.11s]  So, okay, much love to you.
[4080.67s -> 4083.49s]  Are you going to build that fucking thing, stupid?
[4084.75s -> 4085.39s]  It's hard.
[4085.39s -> 4086.59s]  It's cardboard for kids.
[4087.71s -> 4090.27s]  Boston game, Boston game, give another $50.
[4092.21s -> 4093.65s]  Sorry about the sorry, but in all seriousness,
[4093.65s -> 4096.13s]  I've enjoyed your content for years and this is the least I can do
[4096.13s -> 4098.21s]  to repay all the joy and entertainment you've given me.
[4098.93s -> 4104.58s]  I mean, what about my repayment to you?
[4104.58s -> 4106.58s]  You don't even like, look at where I am right now.
[4108.38s -> 4112.54s]  I moved to Las Vegas and I'm like working with a studio
[4112.54s -> 4113.90s]  and I'm going to be doing a bunch of shit on like,
[4114.70s -> 4117.02s]  who like, who made that happen?
[4117.02s -> 4117.50s]  You know what I mean?
[4118.06s -> 4120.54s]  Sure, I run the stream and like I make the stuff,
[4120.54s -> 4122.06s]  but if there weren't people here,
[4123.81s -> 4125.57s]  supporting the stream and giving the fucking money
[4125.57s -> 4126.85s]  and then if there weren't people here,
[4126.85s -> 4127.81s]  then I wouldn't be able to do it.
[4129.01s -> 4129.81s]  Don't forget that.
[4130.53s -> 4131.17s]  It's important.
[4133.84s -> 4139.31s]  But I've been on the same step for 40 minutes.
[4139.31s -> 4142.03s]  Well, but there were like some extenuating circumstances.
[4142.11s -> 4143.87s]  Like a thousand dollars came in
[4144.43s -> 4146.59s]  and I'm going to give it the attention that I believe it deserves.
[4146.59s -> 4147.47s]  So I'm sorry.
[4148.35s -> 4158.32s]  There's so many subscribers.
[4158.32s -> 4160.16s]  That subscription noise is going to happen
[4160.16s -> 4161.76s]  for like the next 20 or 30 straight minutes.
[4166.75s -> 4168.59s]  I created, I made this.
[4168.59s -> 4169.71s]  Oh my goodness.
[4170.51s -> 4173.63s]  That's, that's from, that, that's how many notifications,
[4173.63s -> 4174.67s]  pick up all the notifications.
[4176.08s -> 4177.76s]  That's from probably like 20 minutes ago
[4182.59s -> 4184.35s]  and five more subs from bet three.
[4185.97s -> 4190.08s]  Cheers everybody for real.
[4190.08s -> 4196.56s]  Smoke if you got them.
[4197.38s -> 4199.30s]  If you don't want that smoke, smoking is bad for you.
[4199.30s -> 4199.80s]  All right.
[4200.34s -> 4201.38s]  So these all need to go.
[4204.32s -> 4206.08s]  The, am I doing this the right way?
[4206.08s -> 4207.12s]  I think I am, right?
[4207.12s -> 4208.00s]  Because, right?
[4208.00s -> 4208.88s]  That's the correct way, right?
[4209.52s -> 4212.54s]  The piece is the wrong, wrong way.
[4215.70s -> 4242.08s]  That's not, well, you match it up with the, like, okay.
[4242.08s -> 4242.72s]  No, that's okay.
[4242.72s -> 4243.44s]  They were right there.
[4243.44s -> 4243.68s]  You're right.
[4243.68s -> 4244.00s]  You're right.
[4244.00s -> 4244.08s]  Right.
[4244.08s -> 4244.48s]  You're right.
[4244.48s -> 4244.80s]  You're right.
[4244.80s -> 4245.36s]  You're right.
[4245.36s -> 4245.86s]  You're right.
[4246.64s -> 4252.03s]  And when you're right, you're right.
[4252.03s -> 4256.38s]  You just are.
[4256.38s -> 4258.06s]  Why is he taking an hour to do this?
[4259.34s -> 4261.90s]  If you just jumped in or if you were here like an hour ago.
[4261.90s -> 4262.06s]  Okay.
[4262.06s -> 4262.62s]  So that's it.
[4262.62s -> 4263.50s]  I got to, I got to explain.
[4263.50s -> 4268.06s]  But the people that, I should have just been staring at this.
[4268.06s -> 4272.66s]  Like, I don't understand how this, how does this work?
[4273.70s -> 4274.58s]  Like, all right.
[4274.58s -> 4277.78s]  Well, I started this and then there was, there was a lot of money came in.
[4278.50s -> 4281.46s]  So I, I had to stop for like a while.
[4281.46s -> 4281.94s]  I'm sorry.
[4283.15s -> 4284.35s]  I'm sorry.
[4284.35s -> 4284.67s]  Okay.
[4284.67s -> 4285.31s]  Check your work.
[4285.31s -> 4286.03s]  Work looks good.
[4289.87s -> 4291.87s]  Everything up on the side looks all right.
[4291.87s -> 4292.43s]  You tell me.
[4295.39s -> 4296.27s]  That's bad.
[4296.27s -> 4297.15s]  That was a bad view.
[4298.18s -> 4299.70s]  Time to join up to the big fat guy.
[4300.56s -> 4301.76s]  Fold up this edge.
[4301.76s -> 4302.80s]  Maybe we're the right way.
[4302.80s -> 4303.92s]  No, we're not the right way.
[4304.48s -> 4305.73s]  So that goes up.
[4306.29s -> 4307.09s]  This goes through.
[4309.86s -> 4310.90s]  Streamer sucks.
[4311.46s -> 4315.10s]  Don't be so mean to me.
[4315.10s -> 4315.42s]  All right.
[4315.42s -> 4316.38s]  So then this part.
[4317.74s -> 4323.34s]  I changed my mind.
[4323.34s -> 4326.30s]  Can I please have my $700 donation back, please?
[4328.82s -> 4330.02s]  All sales are final.
[4331.28s -> 4331.78s]  Whoa.
[4333.23s -> 4333.73s]  Whoa.
[4334.37s -> 4335.25s]  Hold on a second here.
[4345.42s -> 4346.94s]  There's RT's money.
[4351.74s -> 4353.18s]  Big money is getting to him.
[4353.74s -> 4355.42s]  No, I don't even want that to happen.
[4356.06s -> 4359.17s]  I need to continuously proud myself.
[4361.09s -> 4361.65s]  I can't.
[4362.29s -> 4362.85s]  I won't.
[4363.49s -> 4365.06s]  Okay.
[4365.06s -> 4365.94s]  There we go.
[4365.94s -> 4367.55s]  So that's not sitting still though.
[4373.52s -> 4374.32s]  Why is this not flat?
[4374.88s -> 4377.22s]  This is not flat.
[4377.22s -> 4378.02s]  Mine's not flat.
[4378.02s -> 4378.52s]  Why?
[4385.49s -> 4387.57s]  That's the Vegas gambling stream money.
[4388.29s -> 4390.48s]  This is freaking me out, man.
[4390.48s -> 4392.24s]  This like popsicle stand looking shit here.
[4392.24s -> 4392.40s]  Okay.
[4392.40s -> 4393.12s]  This goes up.
[4394.00s -> 4394.96s]  I want you guys to be able to see.
[4396.00s -> 4398.34s]  So that goes up like this.
[4399.30s -> 4402.35s]  Like that.
[4403.15s -> 4407.39s]  And then it folds all the way.
[4408.35s -> 4413.76s]  I never did this one.
[4414.16s -> 4415.20s]  Fuck, I never did this one.
[4416.00s -> 4419.74s]  There it is.
[4419.74s -> 4419.98s]  Okay.
[4419.98s -> 4420.30s]  Hold on.
[4420.30s -> 4421.18s]  I need to make sure that's tight.
[4421.74s -> 4423.02s]  Should I get the little flaps here?
[4423.82s -> 4426.37s]  Can you get a casino stream?
[4426.37s -> 4427.65s]  I would probably do something like that for fun,
[4427.65s -> 4429.57s]  but you cannot film in a casino in Vegas.
[4430.53s -> 4431.97s]  You will get slapped in the face.
[4433.73s -> 4434.93s]  If you, if I was just sitting there like,
[4434.93s -> 4437.57s]  oh, hey guys, should I hit on black, I got blackjack.
[4437.57s -> 4440.14s]  It would be like, it would be bad.
[4440.86s -> 4444.86s]  Hold the side.
[4444.86s -> 4447.10s]  You rolled up with one hand like that.
[4447.10s -> 4448.22s]  Like an ice cream sandwich.
[4448.78s -> 4449.58s]  Flip this one up.
[4452.64s -> 4453.60s]  Use a hidden camera.
[4457.31s -> 4459.63s]  I'm not going to jail for our stream.
[4459.63s -> 4467.98s]  All right.
[4467.98s -> 4469.10s]  Well, I need to pay attention.
[4469.10s -> 4469.74s]  This comes up.
[4470.38s -> 4473.89s]  Do it for views.
[4474.61s -> 4477.14s]  Look at that.
[4477.14s -> 4478.34s]  This is going to sound so nice.
[4481.71s -> 4486.37s]  That goes in there, right?
[4486.37s -> 4486.77s]  Come on.
[4486.77s -> 4487.41s]  Tell me it does.
[4487.41s -> 4488.05s]  I know it does.
[4488.05s -> 4489.09s]  I've seen this movie.
[4491.66s -> 4492.54s]  For content.
[4493.26s -> 4498.37s]  That's not a hidden camera in a casino is not.
[4499.01s -> 4501.31s]  How is that like content?
[4503.74s -> 4505.10s]  Just go watch cops.
[4505.10s -> 4510.45s]  You'll see the same material from the side.
[4510.45s -> 4511.41s]  All the taps come up.
[4512.13s -> 4513.66s]  I don't think I folded these yet.
[4517.33s -> 4518.93s]  Build a labo in the casino.
[4519.57s -> 4522.30s]  I'll tell you what I was actually going to do.
[4522.30s -> 4523.18s]  What I thought would be funny.
[4524.62s -> 4525.98s]  I'm sorry that I'm going to spoil this
[4525.98s -> 4527.74s]  because it was a really, really good idea.
[4527.74s -> 4531.26s]  I was going to, there are a lot of mountains around here.
[4531.90s -> 4533.74s]  There's like two that way.
[4533.74s -> 4535.66s]  There's like three that way.
[4535.66s -> 4537.58s]  Vegas is surrounded by mountains.
[4538.14s -> 4539.02s]  And I thought it would be funny.
[4539.02s -> 4539.90s]  This is not going to spoil it.
[4539.90s -> 4540.30s]  Don't worry.
[4540.86s -> 4542.46s]  I thought it'd be funny if I built the labo
[4542.46s -> 4544.70s]  like on the top of like the summit of one of the mountains.
[4545.90s -> 4551.57s]  Like, oh, we're doing a labo today.
[4551.57s -> 4551.97s]  Labo.
[4551.97s -> 4553.41s]  And then it's just me like wind gusting
[4553.41s -> 4555.25s]  and like trying to build a labo on the summit of a mountain.
[4558.30s -> 4562.78s]  Like Las Vegas just has so many mountains everywhere.
[4563.50s -> 4568.80s]  So in every direction do it.
[4568.80s -> 4570.48s]  I there wasn't enough time.
[4571.28s -> 4574.08s]  I'd have to like, that's a huge project.
[4574.08s -> 4575.92s]  Way more than I think anybody realizes.
[4577.30s -> 4579.30s]  I don't think I would even be able to have internet up there.
[4579.30s -> 4582.10s]  That was a huge problem with the hot air balloon stuff too is
[4583.14s -> 4584.58s]  you just don't fucking have internet.
[4585.14s -> 4588.18s]  Like it's just not possible to like get it
[4588.18s -> 4590.66s]  actually like the way that I really,
[4590.66s -> 4591.86s]  really, really would want it to happen.
[4596.64s -> 4598.72s]  Try to climb Everest so you can build a labo.
[4599.44s -> 4602.02s]  Please come in.
[4603.74s -> 4606.13s]  Oh, oh no.
[4606.13s -> 4606.37s]  Okay.
[4607.17s -> 4607.97s]  Is that supposed to happen?
[4609.31s -> 4609.63s]  It is.
[4610.35s -> 4614.29s]  Just use a really long cable.
[4615.01s -> 4617.41s]  This is why people give you money.
[4619.41s -> 4621.49s]  Well, it's kind of, it's a cycle that
[4623.33s -> 4625.01s]  you know, I use the money.
[4625.97s -> 4628.37s]  So if somebody, like for instance, this money right here,
[4628.37s -> 4629.81s]  this is probably going to go directly.
[4629.81s -> 4633.01s]  Oh, the way that I get paid from Twitch
[4634.45s -> 4638.13s]  is like every month I want to like,
[4638.13s -> 4640.93s]  you know, do something that something different
[4640.93s -> 4644.37s]  or that costs money or that's where the money goes.
[4645.17s -> 4646.29s]  If you're curious as to where like,
[4646.29s -> 4648.05s]  oh, where do I, where does my sub money go?
[4648.05s -> 4649.41s]  Where does my like bit money go?
[4650.37s -> 4652.77s]  I mean, I'm going in front of a green screen in like five days
[4653.65s -> 4655.01s]  and I have a shitload of props
[4655.01s -> 4657.01s]  and we're doing like a whole green screen community event.
[4657.81s -> 4659.97s]  That's kind of like, that's kind of where it goes.
[4662.21s -> 4664.29s]  Every like 30 to 45 days I try to
[4665.49s -> 4666.77s]  think of something to do, you know,
[4666.77s -> 4668.37s]  and why can I not do this?
[4674.96s -> 4676.08s]  Am I doing this wrong?
[4681.02s -> 4681.82s]  This comes up.
[4681.82s -> 4682.30s]  Okay.
[4682.30s -> 4683.82s]  I was like, what the fuck am I doing wrong?
[4690.72s -> 4698.35s]  There we go.
[4698.35s -> 4700.99s]  Yeah, now look, I'll be completely and totally
[4701.87s -> 4704.59s]  see-through about this and I'll be transparent about it.
[4704.59s -> 4708.75s]  Of course, the money also goes to me living out here
[4708.75s -> 4712.35s]  and me living and expenses and eating and food and groceries
[4712.35s -> 4716.51s]  like, but a huge amount of it goes to the fuck
[4716.51s -> 4721.60s]  right to this room, right to immediately back
[4728.53s -> 4730.85s]  because I always told myself years ago
[4730.85s -> 4732.37s]  if I was ever in a position to be able to
[4733.25s -> 4734.53s]  do something like this,
[4735.09s -> 4736.69s]  but I was going to try to do it, right?
[4736.69s -> 4738.21s]  And I wanted to do the things that I wanted to do.
[4741.55s -> 4742.91s]  What the fuck is in there?
[4746.42s -> 4747.14s]  Can you see that?
[4748.27s -> 4748.75s]  Oh, you can.
[4748.75s -> 4748.99s]  Okay.
[4748.99s -> 4760.66s]  So it's this these come up because it okay.
[4760.66s -> 4767.76s]  So that folds in and that one goes in like that, right?
[4770.56s -> 4772.24s]  So wasp in your labo.
[4773.12s -> 4775.38s]  Put it out.
[4775.38s -> 4775.78s]  Put it out.
[4775.78s -> 4776.10s]  Put it in.
[4776.10s -> 4776.58s]  Put it out.
[4778.69s -> 4780.37s]  Show finances on stream.
[4781.09s -> 4785.10s]  Let me get a refill.
[4786.64s -> 4788.72s]  If you want, if you want like money information,
[4788.72s -> 4790.24s]  the green screen stream will probably be about
[4791.76s -> 4800.11s]  in total probably 1200 bucks to just to get it done.
[4805.33s -> 4808.05s]  And that's that's really reasonable considering all
[4808.05s -> 4808.93s]  the shit that I'm going to be doing.
[4816.83s -> 4823.78s]  I'm going to stop donating.
[4823.78s -> 4825.38s]  He's getting too powerful.
[4827.38s -> 4828.70s]  Was that a hundred bucks?
[4829.66s -> 4833.65s]  Add that to the green screen list.
[4833.65s -> 4834.45s]  By the way, I have to do that.
[4836.51s -> 4837.95s]  Pocket Pauling given to the hundred dollars.
[4847.84s -> 4848.32s]  Thank you, dude.
[4848.88s -> 4851.98s]  Jeremy, did you know I'm running out of things to say to be honest.
[4851.98s -> 4853.58s]  Thank you for being my favorite YouTuber
[4853.58s -> 4855.18s]  and you deserve every single cent.
[4855.74s -> 4856.78s]  You deserve the world.
[4856.78s -> 4859.18s]  Also shout out to blue 2018
[4859.18s -> 4862.06s]  and also my pronouns are they and them
[4862.06s -> 4863.90s]  for future reference, transgender pride.
[4865.25s -> 4865.73s]  Absolutely.
[4867.02s -> 4867.98s]  Thank you so much.
[4867.98s -> 4868.62s]  Pocket Pauling.
[4870.78s -> 4872.46s]  I don't know.
[4872.46s -> 4873.50s]  I don't think I deserve the world.
[4873.50s -> 4874.06s]  I really don't.
[4875.02s -> 4876.94s]  I just try to do my best,
[4877.82s -> 4879.26s]  which I think is something that
[4879.90s -> 4881.66s]  that's all I care about.
[4881.66s -> 4882.62s]  I just want to do my best.
[4882.62s -> 4884.30s]  And if my best is good enough, then it is.
[4884.30s -> 4885.18s]  If it isn't, then it's not.
[4885.90s -> 4890.78s]  But for the future, I will keep that in mind for sure.
[4893.81s -> 4898.72s]  And yeah, you give it a fucking shitload of money.
[4900.53s -> 4901.81s]  I don't want to take over the world.
[4902.53s -> 4903.41s]  I wouldn't want that.
[4904.21s -> 4907.01s]  I feel like I don't think it would.
[4907.01s -> 4907.89s]  I don't think it would go well.
[4909.89s -> 4911.33s]  I would replace every M&M.
[4911.97s -> 4913.25s]  You know, that'd be the first thing I would do.
[4914.05s -> 4915.41s]  Oh, what's the first order of business?
[4915.41s -> 4916.77s]  Oh, well, you know, we got health care.
[4916.77s -> 4918.85s]  We've got, we've got like taxes.
[4918.85s -> 4920.53s]  No, I'm going to replace every M&M,
[4920.53s -> 4922.37s]  which is with with green M&Ms.
[4923.52s -> 4924.32s]  That's it.
[4924.32s -> 4924.88s]  I like that.
[4924.88s -> 4926.16s]  That's gonna take a long fucking time.
[4926.16s -> 4927.04s]  It's gonna take a lot of work.
[4927.84s -> 4928.64s]  A lot of work.
[4929.28s -> 4934.22s]  All right.
[4934.22s -> 4935.10s]  What piece am I on?
[4944.24s -> 4945.68s]  Why would you do the green M&Ms?
[4945.68s -> 4948.08s]  Because those have the best candy coating flavor.
[4948.72s -> 4952.40s]  That's it.
[4952.40s -> 4952.90s]  Done.
[4953.36s -> 4955.46s]  I'm done.
[4955.46s -> 4956.61s]  I did it.
[4956.61s -> 4958.29s]  Why am I trying to yell to him?
[4958.29s -> 4958.79s]  All right.
[4959.65s -> 4960.69s]  First flip the...
[4960.69s -> 4961.41s]  We got two now.
[4963.26s -> 4963.76s]  One, two.
[4966.61s -> 4967.17s]  Yeah.
[4967.17s -> 4970.61s]  Jerma, everything you know is a lie with that attitude.
[4971.33s -> 4977.92s]  Now we have to lick it shut.
[4977.92s -> 4978.88s]  It's like an envelope.
[4991.97s -> 4993.17s]  Which piece is this one?
[4993.17s -> 4995.55s]  This one.
[4995.55s -> 4996.59s]  So wait a minute.
[4996.59s -> 4997.63s]  Shut up, Nintendo.
[5000.05s -> 5006.83s]  Oh, stomp on it.
[5006.83s -> 5007.39s]  I'm not gonna...
[5007.39s -> 5008.83s]  Why would I stomp on this?
[5009.97s -> 5011.89s]  I can't fuck this place up.
[5011.89s -> 5012.39s]  Okay.
[5015.25s -> 5016.69s]  So then this now...
[5016.69s -> 5018.29s]  Now lay the base on top of the pedal.
[5018.29s -> 5019.65s]  I'm sure it can handle the weight.
[5036.43s -> 5036.93s]  Okay.
[5042.51s -> 5043.95s]  Roll the whole thing over on its side.
[5043.95s -> 5045.87s]  That bottom flap should tuck neatly under.
[5046.75s -> 5050.22s]  I am going to break this.
[5050.22s -> 5051.10s]  It probably will happen.
[5052.46s -> 5053.82s]  So roll on its side.
[5055.36s -> 5056.00s]  Like that.
[5056.80s -> 5058.26s]  I don't know what...
[5058.26s -> 5059.38s]  It wasn't the absolute heck fire.
[5059.38s -> 5060.10s]  Do you want me to do here?
[5061.14s -> 5062.34s]  Lock the pedal and base together.
[5062.98s -> 5069.23s]  So this folds down that.
[5070.62s -> 5077.36s]  And then this goes in like that.
[5077.36s -> 5088.61s]  Okay.
[5088.61s -> 5096.30s]  So they're right.
[5096.30s -> 5097.10s]  Am I doing that right?
[5097.10s -> 5097.66s]  Is that correct?
[5102.64s -> 5103.12s]  Yeah.
[5103.12s -> 5103.84s]  Oh yeah.
[5103.84s -> 5104.32s]  That's right.
[5107.39s -> 5108.67s]  Everything looks nice and secure.
[5108.67s -> 5110.75s]  Make sure it matches on what's on screen.
[5110.75s -> 5111.25s]  It does.
[5111.87s -> 5115.58s]  Flip it over.
[5115.58s -> 5121.79s]  That one goes down and this one goes...
[5121.79s -> 5122.29s]  Oh!
[5126.22s -> 5126.70s]  Uh-oh.
[5126.70s -> 5127.66s]  Is it lined up correct?
[5127.66s -> 5128.62s]  It might not be lined up right.
[5129.97s -> 5130.47s]  Yeah, it is.
[5131.09s -> 5140.64s]  That's in.
[5140.64s -> 5141.60s]  That's in.
[5141.60s -> 5142.24s]  Looks nice, secure.
[5142.24s -> 5143.60s]  I hope it matches what's on screen.
[5143.60s -> 5144.10s]  It does.
[5144.80s -> 5146.24s]  It does, Nintendo.
[5146.88s -> 5149.34s]  Turn the whole thing over so you get the eyes.
[5150.14s -> 5152.14s]  And this is the part.
[5152.14s -> 5153.10s]  I didn't fold this part.
[5154.14s -> 5154.64s]  Yeah, it did.
[5156.59s -> 5158.51s]  Down, in, in, up, secure.
[5158.51s -> 5159.07s]  You got it.
[5169.52s -> 5172.43s]  Up, in, in.
[5173.23s -> 5174.32s]  Pedal is done.
[5175.20s -> 5175.68s]  Done.
[5175.68s -> 5176.18s]  Here it is.
[5176.72s -> 5182.32s]  Hey, am I making a shoe box?
[5182.32s -> 5183.28s]  No, this is a...
[5183.28s -> 5184.16s]  This is a...
[5184.16s -> 5192.80s]  I was gonna say United States Postal Service pedal.
[5192.80s -> 5193.30s]  What?
[5195.50s -> 5196.00s]  Okay.
[5196.00s -> 5196.46s]  Final check.
[5196.46s -> 5197.42s]  Get everything in the right place.
[5198.22s -> 5199.66s]  Pedal is getting tired of supporting the base,
[5199.66s -> 5200.86s]  so let's flip them right way up.
[5202.78s -> 5204.85s]  That's it.
[5204.85s -> 5205.73s]  All that for this.
[5206.45s -> 5208.19s]  And that's our base and pedal all joined up.
[5208.19s -> 5209.79s]  Here's to a long and happy relationship.
[5211.02s -> 5213.90s]  Now we're gonna need some rubber bands.
[5213.90s -> 5214.30s]  Okay.
[5214.30s -> 5216.46s]  There are two types to make sure you got the big ones.
[5217.18s -> 5222.02s]  Okay.
[5222.72s -> 5223.36s]  Crack it open.
[5223.92s -> 5225.94s]  That was the slowest pedal.
[5225.94s -> 5226.44s]  I'm...
[5227.14s -> 5227.78s]  I'm sorry.
[5228.42s -> 5230.50s]  It's been an hour and 25 minutes.
[5231.38s -> 5232.10s]  I gotta...
[5232.10s -> 5233.22s]  Come on, we're gonna get snappy here.
[5233.22s -> 5233.72s]  Don't worry.
[5235.04s -> 5236.08s]  Where are the big ones?
[5236.08s -> 5236.64s]  There's only a few.
[5236.64s -> 5237.28s]  How many do I need?
[5239.89s -> 5241.73s]  Oh, there are worms in here!
[5241.73s -> 5242.23s]  Oh!
[5243.97s -> 5244.61s]  That's not funny.
[5244.61s -> 5245.09s]  Don't do that.
[5245.65s -> 5250.69s]  I mean, there are three big ones?
[5257.25s -> 5258.21s]  There's only three big ones.
[5258.21s -> 5259.25s]  Hopefully they gave me enough.
[5259.25s -> 5260.21s]  Do I have a defect?
[5261.41s -> 5262.93s]  Fucking defect, Nintendo?
[5266.12s -> 5267.16s]  All right, so we got three.
[5268.44s -> 5270.20s]  First, flip the whole pedal wide open.
[5270.20s -> 5271.16s]  Wow, so flexible.
[5271.72s -> 5272.68s]  Whoa, easy there.
[5273.40s -> 5274.76s]  Can mine do that?
[5275.56s -> 5277.38s]  What if mine can't do that?
[5277.38s -> 5283.92s]  I can't go that far.
[5283.92s -> 5284.42s]  Ah!
[5285.43s -> 5285.93s]  Ow!
[5287.09s -> 5287.97s]  I can't go the...
[5287.97s -> 5288.47s]  Ah!
[5289.01s -> 5289.51s]  It hurts.
[5290.37s -> 5291.75s]  I have 50 more dollars.
[5293.76s -> 5294.26s]  Ugh!
[5294.80s -> 5298.95s]  I can't believe these people
[5298.95s -> 5299.99s]  are still giving me this much money.
[5299.99s -> 5301.03s]  You guys are fucking incredible.
[5302.13s -> 5304.21s]  DivUSP gave 52 dollars.
[5304.77s -> 5307.09s]  Hey, Jerma, since this is basically a money stream...
[5309.86s -> 5311.94s]  I just want to donate, like, fuck it.
[5311.94s -> 5312.44s]  LOL.
[5313.06s -> 5314.02s]  But seriously though,
[5314.02s -> 5315.14s]  wanted to thank you for everything.
[5315.14s -> 5316.98s]  These past few months have been really bad.
[5316.98s -> 5318.82s]  Just depressing, stressful, and painful as hell.
[5319.56s -> 5320.28s]  But as of recent,
[5320.28s -> 5321.40s]  things have been getting slightly better.
[5321.80s -> 5323.64s]  Finally getting a job, building opportunities.
[5324.36s -> 5326.20s]  And even though I don't want to get my hopes up,
[5326.20s -> 5327.96s]  I feel like things are slowly improving.
[5327.96s -> 5330.04s]  I want to say thanks since your stream helped me out a lot.
[5332.48s -> 5336.85s]  First of all, I'm ecstatic
[5336.85s -> 5340.20s]  that you're starting to see some opportunities
[5340.20s -> 5341.96s]  and that things are starting to look up a little bit here.
[5345.60s -> 5346.96s]  I'm shocked every day, man,
[5346.96s -> 5347.46s]  that people...
[5351.54s -> 5353.46s]  I can help you, honestly.
[5354.61s -> 5358.74s]  I'm more than humbled and more than happy to do it.
[5360.02s -> 5361.06s]  I really hope you do well.
[5363.62s -> 5365.46s]  As a 33-year-old man, let me tell you,
[5366.42s -> 5367.70s]  it takes a long time.
[5367.70s -> 5368.74s]  It takes more than you think.
[5369.38s -> 5370.71s]  I remember 10 years ago,
[5370.71s -> 5372.87s]  when I was in my early 20s,
[5372.87s -> 5374.47s]  I was like, holy shit, what's happening?
[5374.47s -> 5375.27s]  What am I doing?
[5375.27s -> 5376.15s]  What do I have to do with my life?
[5376.15s -> 5376.71s]  What am I doing?
[5376.71s -> 5377.75s]  I need to get a job, right?
[5377.75s -> 5378.87s]  I'm just in a college.
[5379.51s -> 5380.71s]  I had a fucking illness, right?
[5380.71s -> 5382.92s]  And you figure it out.
[5382.92s -> 5384.20s]  You just, you kind of do.
[5385.80s -> 5387.56s]  But thank you so much.
[5389.09s -> 5390.13s]  I hope you're on the right path.
[5390.13s -> 5394.13s]  I hope you are on the path that you want to be on, right?
[5395.01s -> 5397.78s]  Take care of yourself.
[5398.60s -> 5400.04s]  You're the most important person in the world,
[5401.64s -> 5403.00s]  especially up here.
[5403.00s -> 5404.93s]  So take care.
[5404.93s -> 5406.37s]  Thank you so much for even being here, man.
[5407.09s -> 5410.07s]  That's advice that I needed.
[5411.35s -> 5412.55s]  It's advice that I needed, too.
[5413.19s -> 5416.66s]  When I was 25, 26, 24,
[5418.79s -> 5420.87s]  as somebody that's, you know, a little older,
[5422.23s -> 5423.35s]  you kind of figure it out.
[5423.99s -> 5431.54s]  It took me like seven years straight.
[5432.82s -> 5438.07s]  I'm just like skipping the movie here.
[5438.07s -> 5438.71s]  Okay, hold on.
[5438.71s -> 5440.07s]  But thank you so much, dude.
[5440.07s -> 5441.27s]  I wish you the best, for real.
[5442.95s -> 5443.99s]  You don't look 33.
[5443.99s -> 5445.67s]  That's great, because when I'm 40, I'll look 30.
[5446.39s -> 5447.52s]  But I'm losing my hair,
[5447.52s -> 5449.36s]  so that's another problem entirely.
[5449.36s -> 5451.36s]  All right, so we're going to do our stretch here.
[5452.16s -> 5453.70s]  So those of you guys that stretch,
[5453.70s -> 5454.50s]  how far can you go?
[5454.50s -> 5455.46s]  I can't, like, this is my,
[5455.46s -> 5456.10s]  I'm lying on my back,
[5456.10s -> 5457.30s]  and these are my legs straight in the air.
[5458.02s -> 5460.18s]  So like, I can't do this.
[5461.60s -> 5463.36s]  Like, that hurts, right?
[5464.00s -> 5468.96s]  I could do that, but like, this hurts a lot.
[5469.84s -> 5471.36s]  Okay, so where's the rubber band?
[5472.08s -> 5473.81s]  This goes through here,
[5474.53s -> 5478.72s]  through the little rubber band slots.
[5478.72s -> 5480.08s]  I'm assuming that's what those are.
[5480.08s -> 5480.88s]  Make sure it's perfect.
[5480.88s -> 5481.68s]  Make sure it's perfect.
[5484.95s -> 5487.19s]  I tried stretching and accidentally broke my mother's neck.
[5487.83s -> 5491.03s]  Be more, be careful.
[5491.03s -> 5491.53s]  What?
[5494.98s -> 5495.86s]  That goes in there?
[5496.50s -> 5499.03s]  Am I wearing a toupee?
[5503.51s -> 5504.79s]  No, it's real!
[5505.67s -> 5507.43s]  Not a toupee.
[5508.07s -> 5510.63s]  I actually, I had a huge confidence boost.
[5510.63s -> 5511.59s]  Wait a minute.
[5511.59s -> 5512.87s]  I had a huge confidence boost.
[5512.87s -> 5514.07s]  I want to get my hair cut, right?
[5514.71s -> 5515.67s]  So I got a haircut,
[5515.67s -> 5516.55s]  those of you that didn't notice.
[5517.27s -> 5518.39s]  Didn't even notice my haircut.
[5519.03s -> 5520.79s]  So, in the haircut place,
[5521.35s -> 5522.47s]  as I'm getting my haircut,
[5523.36s -> 5526.08s]  haircut lady says to me,
[5526.08s -> 5527.52s]  to my face into the mirror, right?
[5527.52s -> 5528.16s]  Because I'm looking in the mirror,
[5528.16s -> 5529.04s]  looking at her face through the mirror,
[5529.04s -> 5529.92s]  she's looking at me through the mirror.
[5530.80s -> 5532.56s]  Wow, you have really nice hair.
[5532.56s -> 5533.20s]  How old are you?
[5536.76s -> 5537.80s]  What'd you say?
[5537.80s -> 5539.03s]  33.
[5539.91s -> 5540.84s]  It was great.
[5541.48s -> 5546.69s]  And then I walked out of there like,
[5547.73s -> 5549.41s]  like I was a fucking maniac,
[5549.41s -> 5549.89s]  you know what I mean?
[5549.89s -> 5550.61s]  On top of the world.
[5551.41s -> 5553.44s]  My mouse is not there.
[5554.08s -> 5555.04s]  Those of you guys that caught that,
[5555.04s -> 5555.68s]  I'm sorry.
[5555.68s -> 5557.20s]  And now my mouse doesn't do this.
[5557.20s -> 5557.68s]  This does.
[5558.56s -> 5559.76s]  All right, lift the pedal all the way up.
[5560.96s -> 5562.08s]  The rubber band's not twisted.
[5565.68s -> 5567.52s]  No, that looks fine, right?
[5573.12s -> 5573.76s]  It's perfect.
[5576.16s -> 5577.36s]  Now let's close the pedal back down.
[5577.36s -> 5578.08s]  That's much better.
[5578.64s -> 5580.60s]  The pedal and base are complete.
[5583.41s -> 5583.89s]  Time check!
[5585.06s -> 5585.94s]  60 to 90 minutes?
[5586.66s -> 5590.80s]  It's been, it's been 90 minutes.
[5591.52s -> 5594.36s]  They say that to everybody.
[5594.36s -> 5595.32s]  They're like, don't know what they say.
[5595.96s -> 5598.48s]  I mean, I gave her a good tip.
[5599.44s -> 5600.08s]  Is that what she was,
[5600.08s -> 5600.88s]  is she wanted the tip?
[5601.44s -> 5602.16s]  Did I get like,
[5602.16s -> 5603.52s]  did I get like tip scammed?
[5610.26s -> 5610.90s]  No, I was like,
[5613.68s -> 5614.64s]  hold on, how much you want?
[5616.72s -> 5617.44s]  Hey, take that.
[5620.79s -> 5621.19s]  Whatever.
[5621.99s -> 5623.19s]  She still said it.
[5623.19s -> 5624.47s]  So part three, this needs to get,
[5624.47s -> 5625.11s]  we make the frame.
[5625.11s -> 5626.07s]  Let's get this out of the way.
[5626.95s -> 5627.84s]  We need D.
[5628.96s -> 5629.84s]  This can move as well.
[5630.56s -> 5631.48s]  We need D.
[5636.02s -> 5636.34s]  D!
[5636.90s -> 5647.84s]  Oh, it smells like gasoline.
[5651.41s -> 5651.81s]  Why?
[5652.53s -> 5656.58s]  Oh my God.
[5657.54s -> 5661.84s]  Pocket Pauling.
[5663.68s -> 5668.02s]  Jess gave another $50.
[5678.40s -> 5679.36s]  Pocket Pauling says,
[5680.00s -> 5681.84s]  if there's one thing I actually want from you,
[5681.84s -> 5683.12s]  from my B day actually,
[5683.12s -> 5684.72s]  it'd be for you to tell us one thing.
[5684.72s -> 5686.64s]  Just say this one thing.
[5686.64s -> 5687.52s]  It's very important.
[5688.16s -> 5705.76s]  He's a no life nerd who's never gotten something,
[5707.56s -> 5709.00s]  a cat before in their,
[5709.88s -> 5714.45s]  a cat before in their entire life.
[5726.66s -> 5727.46s]  The full, okay.
[5727.86s -> 5728.50s]  What is a cat?
[5728.50s -> 5729.62s]  Cat is a cat.
[5729.62s -> 5729.94s]  Okay.
[5730.98s -> 5731.38s]  Cat.
[5731.38s -> 5735.94s]  What is a thesaurus for a cat?
[5737.80s -> 5738.20s]  Kitten.
[5738.76s -> 5739.08s]  Cat.
[5742.18s -> 5742.74s]  Feline.
[5750.68s -> 5751.24s]  Garfield.
[5752.12s -> 5753.17s]  Pussycat.
[5763.11s -> 5763.59s]  Ding ding.
[5766.36s -> 5766.76s]  Said it.
[5768.42s -> 5770.66s]  Wiser words have never been spoken before or since.
[5771.30s -> 5772.93s]  No, I'm sure they have.
[5776.00s -> 5777.28s]  Just edit it.
[5777.28s -> 5779.84s]  Just do the fucking sentence mixing.
[5780.48s -> 5783.00s]  Try to run from my past.
[5795.09s -> 5796.29s]  He's socially awkward.
[5796.29s -> 5797.57s]  I am not socially awkward.
[5797.57s -> 5798.45s]  You ever meet me in public?
[5799.17s -> 5800.71s]  Hey, fine.
[5800.71s -> 5801.99s]  You want to talk socially awkward?
[5801.99s -> 5802.71s]  Those are your eyes.
[5803.51s -> 5807.88s]  Like walking down the street here.
[5807.88s -> 5808.36s]  Danny.
[5808.36s -> 5809.56s]  Danny, what's up, man?
[5809.56s -> 5810.60s]  Danny, how you been?
[5810.60s -> 5811.80s]  It's good to see you again.
[5811.80s -> 5814.84s]  Are you, yeah, both shake your hand for sure.
[5814.84s -> 5816.04s]  I got a good grip like you do.
[5816.04s -> 5816.84s]  We both have good grips.
[5816.84s -> 5818.20s]  Both not socially awkward at all.
[5819.00s -> 5822.36s]  So you still at the printing company?
[5823.62s -> 5824.10s]  Nice, dude.
[5824.10s -> 5824.42s]  Nice.
[5824.42s -> 5824.66s]  Awesome.
[5824.66s -> 5825.06s]  Awesome.
[5826.42s -> 5826.82s]  Me, no.
[5827.70s -> 5829.70s]  I do online media.
[5829.70s -> 5837.67s]  It's like a thing where you, it's online presence.
[5837.67s -> 5838.63s]  An online presence.
[5838.63s -> 5839.03s]  Online.
[5840.37s -> 5841.49s]  How's the printing company going?
[5843.70s -> 5844.18s]  See?
[5844.18s -> 5846.74s]  That's how every conversation I have with people goes.
[5846.74s -> 5848.02s]  Not socially awkward at all.
[5858.07s -> 5858.79s]  Nice job.
[5860.37s -> 5862.29s]  But pocket polling, thank you so much.
[5864.63s -> 5868.37s]  You've gone above and beyond at this point monetarily.
[5869.25s -> 5871.56s]  I took them both out and I wasn't supposed to.
[5871.56s -> 5872.44s]  I fucked it up.
[5872.44s -> 5872.76s]  Whatever.
[5872.76s -> 5873.24s]  We'll save it.
[5874.12s -> 5874.92s]  Just need these two.
[5881.06s -> 5882.02s]  You missed my donation?
[5884.24s -> 5886.96s]  Those of you that are, almost hit the mic.
[5886.96s -> 5888.80s]  That was the right one, right?
[5888.80s -> 5889.68s]  Yeah.
[5889.68s -> 5891.92s]  Those of you that are somewhat new to the channel potentially,
[5891.92s -> 5894.16s]  I don't read anything really during the stream unless it's,
[5896.79s -> 5899.59s]  obviously, if it's $50, like 20 subs.
[5899.59s -> 5903.83s]  Those are, they're huge amounts that I want to obviously address immediately.
[5904.55s -> 5908.39s]  But we do a hangout after the stream where I go over all the bits,
[5908.39s -> 5909.59s]  all the bit messages and everything.
[5909.59s -> 5911.99s]  So I just don't do it during the stream.
[5912.87s -> 5914.79s]  He only reads huge donations.
[5915.91s -> 5918.96s]  It's not untrue.
[5918.96s -> 5921.36s]  So I can't be like, no, it's not untrue.
[5922.24s -> 5927.73s]  Fix the Discord integration.
[5929.04s -> 5930.16s]  Well, I'm a moron.
[5930.16s -> 5931.60s]  So, but I haven't done that yet.
[5932.55s -> 5934.07s]  I will someday.
[5935.49s -> 5937.01s]  All right, I'm ready.
[5937.01s -> 5939.33s]  This goes like this, like this.
[5939.33s -> 5940.05s]  Good.
[5940.05s -> 5945.75s]  Let's fold it all up.
[5945.83s -> 5946.63s]  I know how to do that.
[5946.63s -> 5950.39s]  You guys can still, you might need to turn the brightness up a little bit here
[5950.39s -> 5952.07s]  just because it is getting a little dark.
[5952.07s -> 5955.89s]  It is 440.
[5955.89s -> 5959.51s]  It's, why is time, I'm time traveling right now.
[5965.49s -> 5966.85s]  Oh, what happened to Lego Island?
[5966.85s -> 5968.93s]  Okay, so let me explain this while I have them in it here.
[5976.07s -> 5977.99s]  So everyone wants me to play Lego Island.
[5978.63s -> 5997.46s]  And I bought some, I got a raspberry pea.
[5998.26s -> 6004.61s]  I got a raspberry pea.
[6005.49s -> 6009.68s]  I was going to do a thing where I built a raspberry pea computer
[6009.68s -> 6011.68s]  and install Lego Island on it and play.
[6011.68s -> 6012.64s]  And that was going to be the shtick.
[6013.60s -> 6016.00s]  Make sure you do your research before you buy anything.
[6016.00s -> 6017.60s]  This is, it can't run Windows on here.
[6017.60s -> 6018.32s]  You can't install it.
[6018.32s -> 6018.96s]  You have to go through.
[6019.84s -> 6020.85s]  And there he goes.
[6022.05s -> 6024.93s]  You can't install Windows on your pea.
[6025.57s -> 6032.04s]  So now I just have a pea.
[6032.84s -> 6035.22s]  What am I supposed to do with my pea pea now?
[6035.22s -> 6036.36s]  That I don't know.
[6037.32s -> 6043.76s]  Somebody wanted me to prove it and it was there.
[6045.60s -> 6048.80s]  I can run Linux, but Lego Island does not run on Linux.
[6048.80s -> 6049.60s]  It runs on Windows.
[6050.24s -> 6053.20s]  So I would have to get Linux installed on my pea.
[6054.16s -> 6060.08s]  And then install a virtual machine on Linux for Windows 98 on the pea.
[6061.12s -> 6063.52s]  Which is already slow enough.
[6063.52s -> 6066.24s]  It would be like 0.02 frames a second.
[6069.36s -> 6072.08s]  But that does not mean that I will not use that for something.
[6072.08s -> 6074.56s]  I'm going to build a dumb computer at some point.
[6074.56s -> 6075.60s]  I have all the peripherals.
[6076.56s -> 6078.16s]  I'm going to build a fucking computer with that thing.
[6078.16s -> 6079.36s]  And we're going to do something with it.
[6079.36s -> 6080.16s]  I don't know what we're going to do.
[6081.52s -> 6083.24s]  He's saying it wrong.
[6083.24s -> 6084.04s]  I'm sorry.
[6085.16s -> 6088.12s]  Oh, italics told me last night to make sure I didn't say pea.
[6088.92s -> 6093.22s]  I said it.
[6093.86s -> 6094.10s]  All right.
[6094.10s -> 6099.72s]  Let's fold the Raspberry Pi.
[6101.64s -> 6102.04s]  Whatever.
[6102.68s -> 6105.60s]  I can't even fucking run Lego Island.
[6105.60s -> 6106.16s]  What's it worth?
[6106.88s -> 6129.76s]  But it actually came with a, so the original original plan was
[6130.72s -> 6133.22s]  that's like a Google voice recognition box.
[6134.10s -> 6135.54s]  And I was going to make that on stream.
[6135.54s -> 6138.02s]  We were going to make a robot that I could talk to on stream.
[6138.82s -> 6140.84s]  And it uses a Raspberry guy.
[6142.16s -> 6143.44s]  And oh my God.
[6144.72s -> 6146.00s]  It's a 100.
[6146.64s -> 6148.96s]  The instructions are 100 steps long.
[6149.68s -> 6155.20s]  There was no way I was going to, there was just no way.
[6156.00s -> 6160.29s]  And it needed my IP address.
[6160.29s -> 6162.77s]  And like, I'm not going to show my IP address on stream.
[6163.73s -> 6165.32s]  That's like a death sentence.
[6167.57s -> 6168.93s]  Oh, by the way, here's my IP.
[6170.39s -> 6171.27s]  See ya.
[6171.27s -> 6176.26s]  Like you needed to, it has to like link up to your internet and show it.
[6176.82s -> 6177.56s]  All right.
[6177.56s -> 6178.28s]  So that's all folded.
[6187.30s -> 6187.62s]  It's fine.
[6187.62s -> 6188.90s]  It needs an internal IP.
[6188.90s -> 6189.94s]  Oh, that's yeah, that's fine.
[6189.94s -> 6191.06s]  It would just connect to like a router.
[6191.06s -> 6196.87s]  But I, I don't, I, we just got our internet fixed.
[6199.41s -> 6200.45s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6200.45s -> 6201.33s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6201.33s -> 6201.57s]  All right.
[6201.57s -> 6203.57s]  So make pizza, make pizza.
[6219.84s -> 6221.52s]  Oh, I didn't do it.
[6221.52s -> 6222.93s]  I thought it was in the slot.
[6224.15s -> 6230.16s]  Oh, got it.
[6230.16s -> 6238.00s]  What if somebody guessed your IP address?
[6242.18s -> 6245.96s]  There's, I don't, that's not even like a fucking reality.
[6246.60s -> 6251.62s]  That's like somebody trying to guess cryptocurrency wallets.
[6252.34s -> 6254.18s]  I'll get it one day.
[6254.90s -> 6258.88s]  Looks good.
[6259.44s -> 6267.92s]  What is that?
[6272.36s -> 6273.88s]  When is the poll for the green screen stream?
[6274.98s -> 6276.18s]  That is a great question.
[6277.24s -> 6278.20s]  And you will get it.
[6278.92s -> 6280.60s]  I will tell you at the end of the stream.
[6281.16s -> 6284.12s]  I forgot to do it.
[6284.68s -> 6294.23s]  What do I need?
[6296.68s -> 6304.36s]  The big one.
[6304.36s -> 6305.32s]  There's only one, right?
[6305.32s -> 6306.12s]  This is the only one.
[6308.02s -> 6308.42s]  I guess.
[6309.14s -> 6315.17s]  You guys can narrow it.
[6315.17s -> 6317.41s]  I don't, what, just relax, man.
[6317.41s -> 6323.19s]  Like, come on, relax.
[6323.19s -> 6324.07s]  There's no need for this.
[6324.79s -> 6325.27s]  All right.
[6325.27s -> 6328.63s]  So now we're going to need the grip stickers from the bag.
[6328.63s -> 6330.95s]  Their rough surface will help our pedal from sliding around.
[6330.95s -> 6331.45s]  Okay.
[6332.07s -> 6338.23s]  What is the purpose of the handles on the table serve?
[6351.04s -> 6353.04s]  So a grip sticker.
[6354.39s -> 6356.55s]  If you have trouble spotting the gas between the stickers,
[6356.55s -> 6358.31s]  try gently bending them a bit.
[6358.31s -> 6358.55s]  Okay.
[6358.55s -> 6358.87s]  I do.
[6358.87s -> 6359.35s]  I see them.
[6361.99s -> 6362.55s]  Kind of.
[6362.55s -> 6363.99s]  We've got to get some brightness in here, I think.
[6365.25s -> 6365.73s]  Not yet.
[6366.45s -> 6371.48s]  Relax.
[6371.48s -> 6373.32s]  So how many would just do one strip?
[6373.32s -> 6375.59s]  Let's take a look at where the sticker is going to go.
[6375.59s -> 6376.71s]  It's going to go in the pizza.
[6377.43s -> 6379.11s]  Just don't say food items.
[6379.11s -> 6379.59s]  I'm hungry.
[6381.17s -> 6383.89s]  So one, two there, and then one all the way in the back.
[6384.45s -> 6384.95s]  There.
[6389.97s -> 6391.41s]  Move a long sticker from the sheet.
[6391.41s -> 6393.09s]  Careful you don't get it stuck on anything.
[6395.16s -> 6397.75s]  Where does it go so I can prepare it?
[6399.33s -> 6402.53s]  One into the sticker there, and then it's going to wrap around
[6404.55s -> 6407.32s]  all the way around and then there.
[6408.12s -> 6408.85s]  You got it.
[6411.57s -> 6412.37s]  You got it, man.
[6412.93s -> 6418.53s]  How'd you like that?
[6419.41s -> 6420.61s]  Oh, okay.
[6420.61s -> 6423.01s]  So let's go thumb side first.
[6424.53s -> 6425.25s]  Right here.
[6425.97s -> 6437.56s]  Flip it around and then this goes along the edge.
[6440.23s -> 6449.01s]  That, that, and like that.
[6450.12s -> 6450.52s]  Sweet!
[6451.40s -> 6451.80s]  Sweet!
[6456.98s -> 6460.02s]  Okay, big bits.
[6461.43s -> 6465.19s]  We got, we did, we did have, we had $10 from a free iPod.
[6465.99s -> 6469.19s]  What the fuck do I do with my life?
[6469.19s -> 6469.91s]  I'm stuck.
[6470.47s -> 6470.79s]  Boat.
[6471.35s -> 6473.91s]  And hearing you say that figuring shit out takes time really helps.
[6474.07s -> 6475.83s]  With the anxiety that comes with those thoughts.
[6477.03s -> 6479.03s]  Wish I could join in on the big bits, but I'm broke,
[6479.03s -> 6481.35s]  so just take the rest of my bits that I have lying around.
[6481.91s -> 6483.11s]  Thanks for making the best content.
[6483.83s -> 6486.29s]  Thanks to the free iPod, first of all, and the $10.
[6489.81s -> 6493.01s]  Yeah, as somebody that did not even understand the position
[6494.13s -> 6495.65s]  that I could even possibly be in,
[6496.95s -> 6499.67s]  five to ten years ago, I was just up in the air.
[6499.67s -> 6501.19s]  I just had no idea what was going on.
[6501.83s -> 6504.36s]  I didn't know where I was or where I was going,
[6504.36s -> 6506.44s]  and you just kind of figure something out.
[6507.96s -> 6508.84s]  It just kind of happens.
[6509.40s -> 6510.84s]  And it might be something you don't even know.
[6510.84s -> 6512.04s]  If you, it's like, oh, I'm going to do this,
[6512.04s -> 6513.16s]  and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this.
[6513.88s -> 6514.92s]  That's probably not true.
[6514.92s -> 6516.60s]  It might be something else entirely.
[6516.60s -> 6520.61s]  So thank you so much for your iPod.
[6523.48s -> 6525.00s]  How did I sustain myself before Twitch?
[6525.00s -> 6526.04s]  I had all kinds of odd jobs.
[6526.04s -> 6527.16s]  I did videography.
[6527.16s -> 6528.28s]  I was a substitute teacher.
[6529.24s -> 6533.38s]  I, it was mostly videography.
[6533.38s -> 6534.18s]  I filmed weddings.
[6534.98s -> 6535.70s]  Just freelance.
[6537.57s -> 6538.53s]  I did that for a long time.
[6539.25s -> 6543.41s]  I did, I worked at, I was like an aide.
[6543.41s -> 6545.41s]  I was a teacher's aide for a long time as well.
[6546.29s -> 6550.87s]  But subject, I didn't teach a certain subject.
[6550.87s -> 6553.67s]  I just was a substitute teacher for a school district, so.
[6554.55s -> 6560.13s]  But you just kind of do whatever
[6560.13s -> 6561.41s]  until you find out what you're going to do.
[6562.13s -> 6565.01s]  And sometimes it is, it kind of comes out of left field.
[6565.73s -> 6574.90s]  I had to teach math once, right?
[6575.54s -> 6576.98s]  Yeah, I've had to teach math a couple of times,
[6576.98s -> 6579.06s]  and it was just, I had no idea what the fuck to do.
[6579.78s -> 6580.34s]  It was bad.
[6580.90s -> 6585.40s]  And it always sucks because when you know that
[6586.44s -> 6590.20s]  the students know way more than you, and it's very clear,
[6591.08s -> 6593.56s]  it's just embarrassing.
[6596.12s -> 6597.72s]  It really is fucking embarrassing.
[6598.36s -> 6602.00s]  I remember a kid shit himself in class.
[6603.36s -> 6611.12s]  I, why would, no, first of all, I did not,
[6616.15s -> 6618.55s]  I need to fold this like that.
[6619.19s -> 6624.47s]  You teach freshman driver's ed and it's hell.
[6625.27s -> 6627.48s]  I could probably teach driver's ed.
[6628.58s -> 6630.66s]  I'm a very good real life driver.
[6630.66s -> 6636.18s]  This goes right in the middle, right?
[6636.18s -> 6640.24s]  Like this, all the way through.
[6641.04s -> 6644.10s]  It's a tight fit, but you can do it.
[6644.10s -> 6645.46s]  And then all the way through.
[6645.46s -> 6654.21s]  I feel like I'm in candlelight right now.
[6654.85s -> 6659.27s]  One side and the other.
[6659.27s -> 6660.95s]  There it is, nice and snug.
[6662.15s -> 6663.25s]  Oh, I gotta pee.
[6663.97s -> 6664.77s]  Don't go anywhere.
[6664.77s -> 6665.73s]  Don't go anywhere, I gotta pee.
[6666.45s -> 6668.05s]  How do I turn the BRB screen on?
[6668.69s -> 6671.16s]  What the hell is that?
[6674.23s -> 6675.35s]  Oh, that's the wine.
[6677.73s -> 6679.73s]  This is the wine, this is the wine spigot.
[6680.45s -> 6688.07s]  Hold on, hold on, I got it.
[6688.07s -> 6689.03s]  All right, be right back.
[6791.48s -> 6793.72s]  All right, be right back.
[6856.52s -> 6867.65s]  I'm back.
[6867.65s -> 6881.40s]  It's like I never left.
[6882.04s -> 6883.86s]  Oh yeah, you think this is cool?
[6883.86s -> 6884.26s]  Watch this.
[6885.30s -> 6888.85s]  This chair was way too expensive.
[6888.85s -> 6889.49s]  It's not even good.
[6890.05s -> 6891.65s]  All right, now it's time for the lock.
[6891.65s -> 6892.77s]  The left frame on the pedal base.
[6892.77s -> 6894.13s]  Get over here, pedal base.
[6894.13s -> 6894.45s]  What?
[6895.01s -> 6903.83s]  The ones of this over here now.
[6903.83s -> 6909.22s]  We spent three hours on the part that says it'll be one.
[6909.46s -> 6914.15s]  Um, it's only been an hour and 55 minutes.
[6914.95s -> 6918.39s]  And about 30 of that was the huge amount of money that came in.
[6918.39s -> 6919.19s]  30 minutes or so.
[6919.19s -> 6922.15s]  So really only been about an hour and 30 minutes on this part.
[6922.71s -> 6923.67s]  What are you getting three?
[6924.23s -> 6925.11s]  What are you getting three?
[6926.07s -> 6934.34s]  Blame the donators.
[6934.98s -> 6939.89s]  Turn up the volume.
[6939.89s -> 6941.01s]  No, sure.
[6942.61s -> 6943.81s]  Don't listen to them.
[6943.81s -> 6944.69s]  Do what you want to do.
[6944.69s -> 6945.57s]  But what if they leave?
[6946.13s -> 6947.09s]  I don't fucking care.
[6947.65s -> 6949.17s]  Do what you want to do.
[6955.27s -> 6956.07s]  All right.
[6957.16s -> 6958.92s]  So left is this one over here.
[6964.31s -> 6966.72s]  Like this.
[6966.72s -> 6970.13s]  What the fuck does it do this?
[6972.10s -> 6973.46s]  Stand with the frame and base piece.
[6973.46s -> 6974.50s]  So stand this up.
[6978.58s -> 6980.10s]  That's standing this way.
[6980.82s -> 6991.60s]  And then I got a tab here.
[6991.60s -> 6992.88s]  So it's got to go like this.
[6993.92s -> 6994.72s]  We need brightness.
[6995.36s -> 6995.68s]  All right.
[6995.68s -> 6996.80s]  I'm going to say, do I need brightness?
[6996.80s -> 6999.28s]  And then I want everyone in the chat to say yes or no.
[6999.28s -> 7000.32s]  Do I need brightness?
[7006.07s -> 7006.55s]  Okay.
[7006.55s -> 7013.30s]  That's all I needed to hear.
[7019.60s -> 7021.20s]  Well, that's too much.
[7021.20s -> 7023.22s]  That's fine.
[7023.22s -> 7028.63s]  Make sure we don't get a little ghosting.
[7028.63s -> 7029.11s]  You know what I mean?
[7029.75s -> 7036.52s]  And turn the lights up probably a little bit higher.
[7036.52s -> 7040.92s]  That's good, right?
[7042.39s -> 7043.35s]  Not 15 FPS.
[7043.35s -> 7044.31s]  I don't want to keep it like that.
[7044.31s -> 7044.87s]  That looks fine.
[7045.43s -> 7047.67s]  Let me do the other one here.
[7048.31s -> 7053.94s]  This is what happens when you start streaming in the light
[7053.94s -> 7055.30s]  and it turns into dark.
[7056.02s -> 7062.15s]  Just kind of does this.
[7062.87s -> 7069.92s]  It's not 60 FPS.
[7070.56s -> 7071.92s]  I can't handle 60 FPS.
[7071.92s -> 7074.40s]  You can't even see faster than the human eye 24.
[7074.40s -> 7076.71s]  Let me break.
[7076.71s -> 7077.68s]  All right.
[7077.68s -> 7078.64s]  Where's the level?
[7079.20s -> 7081.88s]  Right there.
[7081.88s -> 7082.60s]  Okay.
[7082.60s -> 7088.39s]  Nice shirt.
[7088.39s -> 7089.27s]  Thanks, man.
[7089.27s -> 7089.59s]  All right.
[7089.59s -> 7091.03s]  So this goes in like that.
[7091.03s -> 7091.75s]  Stick it in.
[7091.75s -> 7093.03s]  And then the tab closes.
[7093.03s -> 7094.39s]  So this has to go in like this.
[7095.43s -> 7098.76s]  You can't see 4K.
[7101.83s -> 7103.11s]  Then you can see 4K.
[7103.99s -> 7107.72s]  And you can't see 4K, but your TV can.
[7109.08s -> 7110.04s]  Ooh, that fell.
[7110.04s -> 7110.60s]  That went in.
[7110.60s -> 7111.56s]  Hopefully that's the right way.
[7115.41s -> 7118.02s]  Yes.
[7118.90s -> 7125.16s]  Is that a Mani shirt?
[7126.72s -> 7127.04s]  No.
[7127.04s -> 7130.16s]  It's like a $12 bargain bin Nightwing shirt.
[7130.80s -> 7134.84s]  That's it.
[7139.44s -> 7140.72s]  And Rage Grandpa just gave $10.
[7141.52s -> 7144.21s]  Thank you.
[7144.21s -> 7144.69s]  No message.
[7148.82s -> 7149.54s]  No, it's Nightwing.
[7150.10s -> 7153.86s]  I was going to be Nightwing for Halloween this year,
[7153.86s -> 7155.38s]  but I was too fat to be in the suit.
[7155.94s -> 7156.58s]  I looked ugly.
[7156.58s -> 7157.22s]  It looked shitty.
[7157.22s -> 7159.06s]  It was like my stomach hung out and it didn't look good.
[7159.06s -> 7160.34s]  And if you go out, if you're going to go out
[7160.34s -> 7161.94s]  and you're going to wear like a Nightwing shirt
[7161.94s -> 7163.14s]  or you're going to be like Nightwing.
[7163.70s -> 7166.02s]  Oh boy, you bet you got to, you can't just,
[7166.02s -> 7167.22s]  you can't have like fat stomach.
[7169.14s -> 7172.39s]  It was like, and like, wow, look at, I'm like,
[7172.39s -> 7175.99s]  look at how sexy I can look in my fucking Nightwing spandex.
[7175.99s -> 7176.39s]  No way.
[7179.84s -> 7182.16s]  Like if I shook my stomach, you'd hear fucking liquid.
[7187.59s -> 7188.87s]  Nightwing was a loser.
[7198.55s -> 7199.19s]  All right.
[7199.19s -> 7199.67s]  Whoa.
[7199.67s -> 7200.55s]  Let's keep going here.
[7201.19s -> 7203.97s]  Oh, you read that one.
[7205.17s -> 7205.49s]  Yep.
[7205.49s -> 7205.89s]  I did.
[7207.44s -> 7207.68s]  Yep.
[7208.24s -> 7209.12s]  I read them all, guys.
[7210.74s -> 7212.42s]  German, does German pay attention to chat?
[7212.42s -> 7213.38s]  I read them all.
[7214.76s -> 7223.14s]  All of them, all of them, all of them.
[7223.14s -> 7224.18s]  That one, even this one, this one.
[7224.18s -> 7224.98s]  Yep.
[7224.98s -> 7225.70s]  He won't read this.
[7225.70s -> 7226.18s]  Yes, he will.
[7226.82s -> 7229.65s]  All right, let's do the,
[7229.65s -> 7232.21s]  let's get this one hour and 60 minute piece done.
[7232.21s -> 7232.93s]  Okay, there's this one.
[7233.49s -> 7234.29s]  I'm going to need another one.
[7234.29s -> 7235.57s]  Okay, I know this one.
[7235.57s -> 7236.21s]  I can do it quick.
[7236.77s -> 7238.98s]  Let's move this out of the way.
[7238.98s -> 7239.78s]  We don't need it for now.
[7240.50s -> 7245.16s]  Fold, fold, fold, fold.
[7245.96s -> 7249.41s]  If you read this one, scream Inspector Gadget.
[7249.41s -> 7250.13s]  I'm not going to scream.
[7250.13s -> 7252.13s]  I just said Inspector Gadget, which proves that I read it.
[7253.09s -> 7256.87s]  All right, the whole thing folds up.
[7256.87s -> 7258.31s]  Just fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.
[7258.31s -> 7259.43s]  This is the other side of the pedal.
[7260.15s -> 7262.39s]  How am I going to get the camera set up so you can see everything?
[7262.39s -> 7264.23s]  That's going to be weird, isn't it?
[7265.03s -> 7268.63s]  One hour and 50 minutes.
[7268.63s -> 7269.51s]  Don't you mean two hours?
[7269.51s -> 7274.63s]  No, two hours would be one hour and then 60 minutes go by and that's two hours.
[7274.63s -> 7275.99s]  So it has not been two hours.
[7275.99s -> 7277.91s]  It's been one hour and 50 minutes.
[7278.87s -> 7280.55s]  Well, it's been two hours and two minutes.
[7281.27s -> 7285.32s]  So that's wrong.
[7285.32s -> 7291.60s]  You said 60.
[7291.60s -> 7295.52s]  I know one hour and 60 minutes have to go by for an hour to be counted.
[7296.64s -> 7300.40s]  Somebody said two hours, one hour and 50 minutes, but that's not it.
[7300.40s -> 7301.76s]  There's an extra 10 minutes there, man.
[7302.56s -> 7306.12s]  So an hour passed.
[7306.12s -> 7310.36s]  No, I'm making the point that somebody said that it had been two hours
[7310.36s -> 7311.88s]  and it was an hour and 50 minutes.
[7313.40s -> 7326.92s]  One hour, 59 minutes, and 60 seconds.
[7326.92s -> 7327.40s]  That's correct.
[7328.20s -> 7329.80s]  God, I'm glad somebody gets it.
[7330.44s -> 7340.80s]  Eat the cardboard.
[7340.80s -> 7342.29s]  I don't think I will.
[7343.01s -> 7351.38s]  All right.
[7351.38s -> 7355.62s]  So I always see you guys have to give me some info here.
[7355.62s -> 7358.82s]  I always see people say like, oh, eat that.
[7358.82s -> 7359.62s]  Eat cardboard.
[7360.80s -> 7361.60s]  Eat Weibo.
[7362.40s -> 7364.00s]  Chew on glass, right?
[7364.00s -> 7368.24s]  Are there streamers that you go in their chat and you say like, oh, eat pants.
[7368.24s -> 7369.04s]  And they're like, okay.
[7369.76s -> 7372.10s]  And they just talk.
[7372.10s -> 7372.98s]  Do they do that?
[7372.98s -> 7374.02s]  Is that like a thing?
[7374.66s -> 7379.40s]  Do you guys convince people to eat shit they're not supposed to eat?
[7379.40s -> 7380.44s]  Is that like a Twitch thing?
[7386.12s -> 7387.56s]  Vinny did it one time.
[7387.56s -> 7389.72s]  Oh, and Vinny ate his pants on stream.
[7390.93s -> 7391.17s]  Did?
[7391.73s -> 7400.39s]  He did.
[7403.51s -> 7403.91s]  Why?
[7403.91s -> 7404.71s]  Why did he do that?
[7405.75s -> 7406.79s]  I need more context.
[7409.35s -> 7410.47s]  Now I have to do it.
[7410.47s -> 7411.27s]  Why would I?
[7411.27s -> 7411.75s]  What?
[7411.75s -> 7412.07s]  Why?
[7412.79s -> 7414.23s]  I don't have to do it.
[7414.23s -> 7419.57s]  Is that?
[7419.57s -> 7419.81s]  Okay.
[7419.81s -> 7420.93s]  Make sure I did that right.
[7420.93s -> 7421.17s]  Did.
[7423.43s -> 7423.99s]  It was crazy.
[7423.99s -> 7424.95s]  He's a real mad man.
[7428.20s -> 7435.03s]  Open your window and scream out of it.
[7435.03s -> 7435.75s]  Okay.
[7435.75s -> 7438.28s]  I will.
[7438.28s -> 7446.82s]  I'm not going to.
[7446.82s -> 7447.30s]  I'm kidding.
[7448.44s -> 7449.48s]  Same thing with this.
[7449.48s -> 7450.12s]  Goes right there.
[7451.60s -> 7456.00s]  We're almost done with 5% of the whole labo.
[7456.00s -> 7458.08s]  Are you guys prepared?
[7459.04s -> 7460.90s]  Are you prepared?
[7461.70s -> 7477.46s]  Fix your posture.
[7477.46s -> 7479.70s]  My posture is flawless.
[7492.31s -> 7492.71s]  Okay.
[7492.71s -> 7497.12s]  We're fine.
[7497.12s -> 7497.52s]  Posture.
[7497.52s -> 7497.76s]  Look.
[7498.96s -> 7501.96s]  Anytime somebody says, oh, fix your posture.
[7501.96s -> 7503.08s]  You guys just go like, okay.
[7503.88s -> 7506.63s]  People don't sit like this.
[7513.28s -> 7514.00s]  Lick the cardboard.
[7514.00s -> 7514.56s]  I paid you.
[7515.65s -> 7519.09s]  Like talk to bottom or like how do you want me to do it?
[7524.52s -> 7525.48s]  Have I been gnomed today?
[7525.48s -> 7526.52s]  I haven't been gnomed in like a week.
[7527.08s -> 7527.56s]  Two weeks.
[7528.12s -> 7529.48s]  All right.
[7529.48s -> 7530.04s]  We did this part.
[7530.04s -> 7530.44s]  We're good.
[7536.45s -> 7537.97s]  Shave your beard on stream.
[7537.97s -> 7538.53s]  I already did that.
[7538.53s -> 7541.04s]  I already showed my fucking skills.
[7541.76s -> 7544.96s]  Where's that piece?
[7557.78s -> 7558.26s]  Read a book.
[7558.90s -> 7560.58s]  No, I'm playing the labo, man.
[7560.58s -> 7562.76s]  This is the only other time I'm ever going to get to do this.
[7562.76s -> 7564.60s]  You guys, you realize that, right?
[7565.56s -> 7565.88s]  This.
[7566.44s -> 7567.32s]  Hey, look.
[7567.32s -> 7568.36s]  I'm playing labo.
[7569.16s -> 7569.80s]  Gotcha.
[7569.88s -> 7571.16s]  Like I can't do this ever again.
[7571.16s -> 7572.28s]  So just let me have this.
[7573.32s -> 7579.73s]  What's it like getting the senior discount?
[7579.73s -> 7581.33s]  It's fucking awesome, actually.
[7581.33s -> 7583.81s]  You get like 20% off literally everywhere you go.
[7584.53s -> 7587.25s]  Well, what's it like saving money everywhere you go?
[7587.25s -> 7587.97s]  That's great, man.
[7587.97s -> 7588.69s]  It's great.
[7588.69s -> 7589.81s]  We want to say it sucks.
[7590.37s -> 7591.41s]  Well, that sucks.
[7591.41s -> 7592.77s]  I hate saving money everywhere.
[7601.92s -> 7603.68s]  Status quo on the green screen Thursday.
[7603.68s -> 7605.44s]  It's locked in with the studio I'm working with.
[7605.44s -> 7609.68s]  Thursday is the green screen stream Thursday afternoon Eastern time.
[7618.24s -> 7619.60s]  I'm going to get a haircut next week.
[7619.60s -> 7621.44s]  If I want the same as yours, what should I tell her?
[7622.08s -> 7625.52s]  Tell her you want the single piece swoop.
[7626.08s -> 7631.60s]  And she'll have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
[7631.60s -> 7640.04s]  So this goes in like that, right here.
[7650.45s -> 7652.45s]  The default Fortnite dance has to happen.
[7652.45s -> 7653.33s]  It's not negotiable.
[7654.13s -> 7656.29s]  I'm not doing a Fortnite dance on a green screen.
[7657.84s -> 7661.12s]  I will be dead in 100 years, right?
[7661.84s -> 7663.20s]  Well, probably way sooner than that.
[7663.76s -> 7667.68s]  But I don't want a keyable Fortnite dance
[7667.68s -> 7669.04s]  that you can just anybody into.
[7669.04s -> 7670.64s]  We're talking like 80 years in the future.
[7671.20s -> 7673.12s]  I don't want that to be available for anybody to have.
[7674.23s -> 7680.82s]  No, why would I want that to be available for anyone
[7681.46s -> 7682.58s]  in like a thousand years?
[7683.30s -> 7686.15s]  All right, here comes the next piece.
[7687.49s -> 7689.25s]  So this comes down here
[7689.25s -> 7690.85s]  and we're going to do the same thing on this side
[7691.57s -> 7692.85s]  that we did on that one.
[7692.85s -> 7698.02s]  Stick it in here, right?
[7698.02s -> 7698.90s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7698.90s -> 7700.58s]  Blue or blue facing in?
[7701.22s -> 7701.86s]  Nope, okay.
[7701.86s -> 7703.06s]  Yeah, I can't do that anyway.
[7705.06s -> 7707.14s]  Shove it in.
[7707.14s -> 7707.78s]  Shove it in there.
[7708.64s -> 7709.12s]  You got it.
[7712.45s -> 7713.17s]  Hope it was right.
[7719.46s -> 7721.94s]  Oh, I don't want to do it so bad
[7721.94s -> 7725.06s]  but people will cringe at me and shit.
[7725.06s -> 7726.26s]  But that's the point.
[7740.93s -> 7742.13s]  Take me to your leader.
[7742.69s -> 7754.48s]  You know what's going to happen.
[7754.48s -> 7755.20s]  Everyone's going to say it.
[7755.20s -> 7757.68s]  Everyone's going to go, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[7758.40s -> 7761.06s]  I knew it was going to happen.
[7761.06s -> 7761.62s]  You didn't even.
[7766.08s -> 7767.36s]  Now it's all the only thing in the chat.
[7767.36s -> 7768.88s]  It's the only thing there.
[7768.88s -> 7770.64s]  It's the only thing in the chat right now.
[7770.64s -> 7771.36s]  You did this.
[7771.36s -> 7771.84s]  You did it.
[7772.40s -> 7774.85s]  Looks good.
[7781.49s -> 7782.29s]  This got it.
[7782.29s -> 7783.25s]  This got sick, dude.
[7786.93s -> 7787.17s]  All right.
[7787.17s -> 7788.61s]  Your pedal's been standing up for straight.
[7788.61s -> 7790.13s]  Why don't you lay it on its back?
[7792.88s -> 7793.68s]  This seems off.
[7794.88s -> 7800.61s]  Is it?
[7800.61s -> 7801.09s]  All right.
[7801.09s -> 7802.13s]  If you need time to take a rest,
[7802.13s -> 7804.69s]  now's my time to honka-chukka, honka-chukka.
[7821.89s -> 7824.20s]  Like, at the spell out.
[7824.20s -> 7825.40s]  Look, let me show you.
[7826.60s -> 7827.64s]  If somebody was snoring,
[7828.36s -> 7831.78s]  like, that's spelled out like this.
[7840.37s -> 7845.11s]  Like, I just said it as a word.
[7855.14s -> 7856.74s]  That's my favorite Pokemon, too.
[7865.56s -> 7867.56s]  Can't see the computer screen.
[7867.56s -> 7870.00s]  It's right here.
[7870.00s -> 7871.12s]  What are you talking about, man?
[7871.12s -> 7871.84s]  What are you talking about?
[7872.48s -> 7873.16s]  All right.
[7873.16s -> 7873.72s]  Let's fold it up.
[7874.44s -> 7883.12s]  Fold the tip.
[7883.12s -> 7884.08s]  I'm doing it.
[7884.08s -> 7887.14s]  I'm really doing it.
[7887.14s -> 7887.64s]  Okay.
[7893.35s -> 7893.99s]  Fold the tip.
[7894.71s -> 7895.35s]  I already did it.
[7896.07s -> 7900.20s]  Get a wax figurine of myself.
[7900.20s -> 7900.60s]  For what?
[7901.48s -> 7903.24s]  Yeah, that'll be like 25 grand.
[7904.04s -> 7914.32s]  You're folding it wrong.
[7915.92s -> 7917.28s]  I'm not folding it wrong.
[7918.08s -> 7918.48s]  You are.
[7919.89s -> 7920.53s]  No, you.
[7922.92s -> 7927.46s]  I'm not folding it wrong.
[7927.46s -> 7927.86s]  No, you.
[7931.78s -> 7938.36s]  All right.
[7938.36s -> 7939.16s]  That comes up.
[7939.16s -> 7939.96s]  Both of them come up.
[7949.65s -> 7950.37s]  This fold.
[7950.37s -> 7951.33s]  I got it the wrong way.
[7952.77s -> 7954.56s]  This has to fold up.
[7955.52s -> 7956.02s]  Fuck.
[7957.36s -> 7957.84s]  Fuck.
[7957.84s -> 7958.34s]  Okay.
[7958.80s -> 7960.68s]  And this folds in.
[7960.68s -> 7961.18s]  Fuck.
[7961.64s -> 7963.49s]  Hold on.
[7963.49s -> 7964.37s]  I need this to be tighter.
[7968.60s -> 7969.40s]  Fuck, dude.
[7969.40s -> 7970.12s]  Okay.
[7970.12s -> 7970.84s]  This comes in.
[7973.54s -> 7974.04s]  Fuck.
[7974.50s -> 7984.68s]  Okay.
[7984.68s -> 7985.56s]  It goes all the way around.
[7986.20s -> 7987.40s]  And then it closes down.
[7987.40s -> 7987.90s]  There.
[7989.11s -> 7992.23s]  Folds down around and that sticks in there.
[7992.23s -> 7994.07s]  What ingenuity.
[7995.11s -> 7996.31s]  Same thing on this one.
[7996.95s -> 7997.43s]  Check it.
[7997.43s -> 7998.07s]  Look at it.
[7998.07s -> 7998.57s]  Check it.
[7999.64s -> 8000.12s]  There you go.
[8000.12s -> 8001.56s]  There's your fucking shitty park bench.
[8002.44s -> 8005.62s]  Go easy on the wine.
[8009.48s -> 8010.04s]  We're good, man.
[8011.25s -> 8011.97s]  I have.
[8011.97s -> 8013.65s]  I'm having so much fun.
[8013.65s -> 8014.15s]  You know?
[8018.88s -> 8023.01s]  That's it for that.
[8023.01s -> 8025.65s]  Fold in the tip or refund all donations.
[8025.65s -> 8026.77s]  What are you talking about?
[8027.65s -> 8030.21s]  What are you talking about?
[8031.12s -> 8031.92s]  It's perfect.
[8032.48s -> 8033.75s]  What do you mean?
[8035.28s -> 8035.76s]  The top.
[8036.82s -> 8037.62s]  Fold the top.
[8038.34s -> 8039.64s]  The top is folded.
[8042.26s -> 8043.06s]  Fold the top.
[8056.28s -> 8057.00s]  That's not the top.
[8057.00s -> 8057.64s]  That's an arm.
[8059.27s -> 8061.91s]  Fold the left arm is what you should have been saying.
[8062.55s -> 8063.91s]  Not fold the top.
[8063.91s -> 8064.63s]  This is the top.
[8065.43s -> 8065.99s]  That's the top.
[8065.99s -> 8067.11s]  This is the left arm.
[8067.75s -> 8075.08s]  Somebody just read.
[8077.65s -> 8081.12s]  Really?
[8081.12s -> 8083.04s]  I have way too much fun when I do this.
[8083.04s -> 8083.52s]  I really do.
[8083.52s -> 8084.08s]  I'm not even kidding.
[8084.08s -> 8085.36s]  I'm having like a fucking great time.
[8089.41s -> 8091.01s]  This is like I love this.
[8092.90s -> 8093.46s]  Okay.
[8093.46s -> 8095.70s]  So this goes like that.
[8101.24s -> 8104.98s]  This Nintendo Labo signature watermark goes down.
[8105.62s -> 8108.92s]  And that sticks in up here.
[8108.92s -> 8109.72s]  Weird, though.
[8109.72s -> 8110.12s]  Weird.
[8114.32s -> 8114.88s]  Weird, though.
[8115.44s -> 8115.92s]  Like that?
[8118.55s -> 8119.11s]  Strange.
[8121.06s -> 8121.86s]  Interesting.
[8121.86s -> 8122.42s]  Weird, though.
[8123.14s -> 8123.38s]  How?
[8124.58s -> 8125.62s]  Slide into the slots in the frame.
[8125.62s -> 8127.30s]  You can do it one side at a time.
[8128.42s -> 8140.31s]  Okay.
[8140.31s -> 8140.95s]  Boom.
[8140.95s -> 8146.05s]  All right.
[8146.05s -> 8146.85s]  Earthquake test.
[8148.77s -> 8149.75s]  That's good.
[8150.31s -> 8156.84s]  We're good.
[8157.64s -> 8163.67s]  I'm not going to break it.
[8164.39s -> 8165.08s]  All right.
[8165.08s -> 8165.72s]  Logos down.
[8168.07s -> 8169.99s]  Attach the bridge to our rubber band from before.
[8169.99s -> 8171.03s]  Turn the whole pedal around.
[8178.26s -> 8180.02s]  Stretch the rubber band out.
[8180.02s -> 8181.14s]  Hook it over the bridge.
[8182.18s -> 8183.22s]  Now you're getting weird here.
[8183.22s -> 8183.38s]  All right.
[8183.38s -> 8185.94s]  So this has come up and then has to go through those slots.
[8186.82s -> 8188.15s]  Turn the pedal around.
[8188.15s -> 8188.95s]  So wait a minute.
[8189.67s -> 8196.63s]  One side.
[8206.79s -> 8208.79s]  Get out.
[8208.79s -> 8209.03s]  No.
[8209.03s -> 8209.91s]  Now it's twisted off.
[8210.55s -> 8233.83s]  Turn the pedal around.
[8233.83s -> 8236.56s]  And can this take this?
[8237.68s -> 8239.36s]  Stretch it out and around underneath.
[8240.32s -> 8242.47s]  This just feels...
[8242.47s -> 8243.27s]  This feels taut.
[8247.12s -> 8248.40s]  Ah, this is gonna break.
[8261.97s -> 8263.81s]  You'll control the toy compatible with your foot.
[8263.81s -> 8265.33s]  Try stepping on it to check how it feels.
[8266.05s -> 8277.09s]  Let's try it out.
[8277.09s -> 8282.85s]  That actually feels pretty good.
[8287.81s -> 8288.05s]  See?
[8288.61s -> 8295.25s]  That works, right?
[8295.25s -> 8301.19s]  I think it's done.
[8308.64s -> 8308.88s]  That's...
[8308.88s -> 8310.00s]  That's it, right?
[8310.00s -> 8313.17s]  Do you feel the tension?
[8313.17s -> 8313.73s]  I do.
[8313.73s -> 8315.01s]  I do feel the tension.
[8315.01s -> 8316.05s]  So we're good.
[8317.09s -> 8319.12s]  What have I done?
[8326.58s -> 8328.16s]  Get out of here.
[8328.16s -> 8328.48s]  All right.
[8328.48s -> 8328.88s]  Let's go.
[8329.84s -> 8333.04s]  Come...
[8333.04s -> 8334.64s]  The pedal is complete.
[8334.64s -> 8335.44s]  The whole pedal.
[8336.16s -> 8338.00s]  Two hours and 19 minutes.
[8338.56s -> 8344.69s]  Now we're gonna put the Joy-Con in.
[8344.69s -> 8346.05s]  It's time to take a quick little pedal.
[8346.05s -> 8346.45s]  Joy-Con.
[8346.45s -> 8347.01s]  Get the Joy-Con.
[8347.01s -> 8348.13s]  Get the blue one.
[8348.13s -> 8348.77s]  This one.
[8348.77s -> 8350.13s]  For those of you keeping track at home.
[8350.85s -> 8351.65s]  Those of you at home.
[8352.45s -> 8364.44s]  Shut up, Nightwing.
[8365.40s -> 8366.20s]  Wow.
[8366.20s -> 8368.34s]  I guess this comes all the way down.
[8368.34s -> 8371.54s]  Push the pedal all the way down with one hand and hold it there.
[8372.26s -> 8374.32s]  And it goes in like this.
[8374.96s -> 8387.52s]  That's gonna break, man.
[8388.32s -> 8393.25s]  Slide the Joy-Con into the hole with the minus button sticking out.
[8393.25s -> 8393.89s]  Make sure it's in.
[8395.01s -> 8399.49s]  How far in does it have to go?
[8402.58s -> 8403.38s]  All the way.
[8403.38s -> 8404.34s]  All the way.
[8404.34s -> 8405.06s]  That's what it said.
[8405.06s -> 8405.46s]  That's what...
[8409.88s -> 8410.36s]  I can see.
[8411.08s -> 8411.96s]  What the fuck?
[8411.96s -> 8413.32s]  You just got rid of the blockage.
[8413.32s -> 8413.56s]  All right.
[8413.56s -> 8413.80s]  Good.
[8415.16s -> 8424.71s]  A little wonky but it's all right.
[8424.71s -> 8437.33s]  Why am I doing that?
[8437.33s -> 8438.02s]  All right.
[8438.02s -> 8438.66s]  Step on...
[8438.66s -> 8439.78s]  Step on me all you like.
[8440.58s -> 8444.44s]  Play now.
[8444.44s -> 8447.99s]  There's a game to play?
[8449.43s -> 8449.67s]  Hold on.
[8449.67s -> 8449.83s]  Wait.
[8449.83s -> 8450.31s]  There's a game?
[8450.31s -> 8451.35s]  What about Game Right Play?
[8452.07s -> 8455.20s]  We get to play a game already?
[8474.47s -> 8474.87s]  Yeah.
[8499.19s -> 8501.99s]  Come on.
[8501.99s -> 8502.55s]  Come on.
[8503.11s -> 8505.56s]  I did it.
[8505.56s -> 8506.84s]  I got first place.
[8506.84s -> 8556.24s]  Ow.
[8556.24s -> 8556.80s]  It's just...
[8556.80s -> 8557.20s]  Okay.
[8557.20s -> 8558.80s]  It's that game with the little...
[8558.80s -> 8561.28s]  You have the trigger and the hold of your...
[8561.28s -> 8561.84s]  You know what I mean.
[8561.84s -> 8562.24s]  You got...
[8562.24s -> 8563.52s]  That's a weird foot.
[8563.52s -> 8563.76s]  Hold on.
[8563.76s -> 8564.48s]  Let me get...
[8564.48s -> 8564.72s]  Hold on.
[8564.72s -> 8565.52s]  Let me get my foot up there.
[8575.97s -> 8579.54s]  I can see my hands.
[8584.36s -> 8585.08s]  It's okay.
[8585.08s -> 8586.28s]  You can see me.
[8586.28s -> 8586.84s]  Never mind.
[8588.10s -> 8588.34s]  All right.
[8588.34s -> 8588.98s]  That was fun.
[8588.98s -> 8590.66s]  I want to build the rest before people scream.
[8592.50s -> 8593.54s]  No, I didn't want to exit.
[8594.18s -> 8594.98s]  Titan Quest?
[8595.78s -> 8611.36s]  All right.
[8611.36s -> 8611.92s]  It works.
[8611.92s -> 8612.72s]  So let's get back.
[8613.44s -> 8626.23s]  You can have more than one person play this.
[8626.23s -> 8627.11s]  Slot cards.
[8627.67s -> 8628.15s]  Circuit.
[8629.27s -> 8631.59s]  Pedal key and spray can.
[8632.63s -> 8634.40s]  What does this mean?
[8635.60s -> 8636.40s]  Meet the team.
[8637.20s -> 8638.64s]  Oh, there you are, Jeremy.
[8638.64s -> 8639.52s]  That's how it's my name.
[8640.32s -> 8643.67s]  I've been watching you through your webcam.
[8644.63s -> 8648.32s]  Are you spying on me?
[8648.40s -> 8649.44s]  You'll never take me alive.
[8651.12s -> 8667.14s]  I'm a little busy.
[8669.72s -> 8671.48s]  No, I wanted to make the rest.
[8672.44s -> 8673.00s]  Sounds great.
[8673.00s -> 8673.72s]  No, no.
[8673.72s -> 8674.04s]  Sorry.
[8676.85s -> 8678.77s]  No, but I can sense your enthusiasm.
[8678.77s -> 8681.65s]  From this day on, you are officially the fourth member of the Toy-Con development team.
[8689.28s -> 8689.60s]  Okay.
[8693.11s -> 8694.07s]  Technology wizard.
[8694.71s -> 8696.76s]  Just knows all kinds of things.
[8696.76s -> 8700.68s]  Oh, now let's introduce fucking Phineas.
[8700.68s -> 8701.72s]  From Phineas and Ferb.
[8703.00s -> 8704.44s]  They're all from the same fucking show.
[8705.08s -> 8705.58s]  Okay.
[8727.28s -> 8728.80s]  Am I locked in a basement?
[8728.80s -> 8730.24s]  I'm just like, I don't want to do it.
[8730.24s -> 8731.28s]  No, no thanks.
[8731.28s -> 8736.64s]  I don't know where you're doing it.
[8736.64s -> 8738.24s]  No, this is a spoiler.
[8738.24s -> 8738.88s]  Is that my hand?
[8748.12s -> 8749.40s]  No, this is a spoiler.
[8749.40s -> 8750.20s]  This is a spoiler.
[8750.20s -> 8751.32s]  I don't want to see the spoilers.
[8752.12s -> 8753.08s]  This is a spoiler.
[8772.53s -> 8773.41s]  B doesn't do anything.
[8775.32s -> 8776.92s]  I have to press let's get started.
[8789.64s -> 8790.36s]  All right.
[8790.36s -> 8793.33s]  Back, back.
[8795.73s -> 8798.21s]  Now, this one is only going to take 15 minutes.
[8798.93s -> 8800.39s]  This is the easy one.
[8801.03s -> 8807.99s]  Wait till I elbow drop that before the stream is over.
[8815.83s -> 8817.19s]  No, time me on this one.
[8817.19s -> 8818.15s]  I'm going to put a timer on it.
[8818.15s -> 8819.11s]  No, yeah.
[8819.11s -> 8820.47s]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen for this one.
[8822.04s -> 8825.16s]  I want a fucking 15 minute timer on the screen.
[8825.96s -> 8828.15s]  How do I add one?
[8831.43s -> 8832.47s]  Let's give me 20 minutes.
[8837.12s -> 8838.80s]  I have to get like a plugin or something, I think.
[8839.36s -> 8849.67s]  I don't think I can do it from just an OBS.
[8850.55s -> 8852.63s]  Just recount for you.
[8852.63s -> 8853.13s]  Okay.
[8854.72s -> 8855.60s]  Yeah, use your phone.
[8855.60s -> 8856.56s]  Use your phone.
[8858.07s -> 8858.57s]  Damn it.
[8859.11s -> 8868.45s]  I almost just locked my phone out for like three days.
[8876.82s -> 8877.32s]  Okay.
[8877.70s -> 8878.20s]  You ready?
[8878.98s -> 8880.95s]  Wait, hold on.
[8881.67s -> 8886.04s]  Two steps, key and Joy-Con.
[8886.04s -> 8887.08s]  I'm going to move this out of the way.
[8887.72s -> 8891.80s]  So it starts when I grab the paper.
[8892.44s -> 8894.48s]  So I need C.
[8895.44s -> 8902.90s]  This one is C, right?
[8903.46s -> 8905.97s]  Okay, so I grabbed it.
[8906.61s -> 8911.70s]  Okay, go.
[8912.32s -> 8916.77s]  Can you see it?
[8918.87s -> 8919.59s]  That's such a bad...
[8919.59s -> 8920.39s]  It's going to turn off.
[8921.35s -> 8922.71s]  That's going to turn off.
[8922.71s -> 8924.23s]  Like it's going to go to like my home screen.
[8925.27s -> 8925.83s]  I can see it.
[8925.83s -> 8926.47s]  Okay, let's go.
[8928.76s -> 8952.87s]  What do I need?
[8952.87s -> 8953.59s]  Empty, right?
[8953.59s -> 8957.38s]  Empty.
[8957.38s -> 8958.42s]  Okay, all right.
[8958.42s -> 8959.22s]  All right, let's go.
[8959.86s -> 8961.30s]  I'm almost one minute.
[8961.86s -> 8963.48s]  Let's start with the key.
[8963.48s -> 8963.96s]  This key.
[8963.96s -> 8964.52s]  This is the key.
[8964.52s -> 8965.24s]  This one here.
[8965.24s -> 8965.80s]  That's a key.
[8966.52s -> 8967.33s]  Make sure the piece...
[8968.77s -> 8969.25s]  Printing on it.
[8969.25s -> 8969.75s]  Flip it.
[8970.21s -> 8973.62s]  There's so many folds here.
[8973.62s -> 8975.54s]  It's going to take 20 minutes to do these folds.
[8985.30s -> 8985.80s]  Two.
[8986.10s -> 8987.35s]  Three.
[8988.53s -> 8989.03s]  Four.
[8989.64s -> 8990.14s]  Five.
[8992.02s -> 8992.52s]  Six.
[8994.07s -> 8994.57s]  Seven.
[8995.68s -> 8996.18s]  Eight.
[8996.80s -> 8997.74s]  Nine.
[8997.74s -> 8998.24s]  Time!
[8998.24s -> 8999.84s]  One minute and 30 seconds.
[9000.88s -> 9001.38s]  Seven.
[9002.19s -> 9002.69s]  Eight.
[9003.84s -> 9004.34s]  Nine.
[9005.92s -> 9006.42s]  Two.
[9006.42s -> 9006.92s]  Three.
[9007.84s -> 9008.56s]  All folded.
[9008.56s -> 9009.06s]  All done.
[9009.06s -> 9009.56s]  Go!
[9009.56s -> 9010.08s]  What's next?
[9010.08s -> 9010.58s]  What's next?
[9011.36s -> 9035.66s]  Stop doing like a bad posture thing.
[9035.66s -> 9036.38s]  Like I'm doing like...
[9036.38s -> 9038.14s]  I'm trying to get you guys to go bad posture.
[9038.14s -> 9039.02s]  I don't know why.
[9039.02s -> 9041.39s]  This comes up.
[9041.39s -> 9042.27s]  Slides through.
[9042.83s -> 9044.60s]  Like that.
[9044.60s -> 9047.97s]  Then in.
[9049.93s -> 9051.21s]  Nice and snug.
[9053.52s -> 9054.02s]  That knee.
[9062.24s -> 9062.74s]  This.
[9063.12s -> 9064.57s]  Same thing on the other side.
[9064.57s -> 9066.09s]  It goes down and around.
[9066.09s -> 9071.07s]  Makes a little cube.
[9071.87s -> 9073.38s]  Like that.
[9075.70s -> 9077.70s]  Use a locking piece to hold everything in place.
[9077.70s -> 9078.98s]  Flip a piece over and fold it in half.
[9083.66s -> 9084.16s]  Three minutes.
[9084.78s -> 9086.70s]  Three minutes.
[9087.50s -> 9088.30s]  That's not going to...
[9088.30s -> 9089.26s]  I'm not going to be close.
[9090.06s -> 9092.58s]  So it goes like that.
[9092.58s -> 9093.86s]  This one popped out a little bit.
[9094.34s -> 9096.90s]  Okay.
[9096.90s -> 9099.30s]  So then it goes in here like this.
[9102.46s -> 9103.26s]  So that's locked.
[9103.82s -> 9104.77s]  Spray through.
[9106.70s -> 9107.26s]  Just a moment.
[9107.26s -> 9109.42s]  Take a check that yours looks like this.
[9109.42s -> 9109.92s]  It does.
[9110.38s -> 9112.30s]  The two knobby bits poking up from one side.
[9112.30s -> 9112.78s]  It's in.
[9112.78s -> 9113.66s]  It looks like that.
[9113.66s -> 9114.54s]  It looks beautiful.
[9115.50s -> 9116.94s]  Looks better than your picture.
[9116.94s -> 9117.44s]  Dickhead.
[9118.14s -> 9118.46s]  All right.
[9118.46s -> 9118.78s]  No.
[9118.78s -> 9119.58s]  That was mean.
[9119.58s -> 9121.02s]  Now this piece may be small but it's tough.
[9121.02s -> 9123.02s]  Be sure to fold it cleanly and firmly.
[9123.02s -> 9124.78s]  These long thin bits are a bit tricky.
[9124.78s -> 9125.66s]  Use both hands.
[9127.36s -> 9139.39s]  I can feel the bass drum in my brain.
[9140.27s -> 9144.21s]  Is it loud?
[9144.21s -> 9145.17s]  Should I turn it down?
[9150.32s -> 9152.24s]  I don't know what the music sounds like because I can't hear it.
[9154.48s -> 9155.28s]  Somebody said that.
[9155.28s -> 9156.00s]  I didn't say that.
[9158.58s -> 9159.14s]  Four minutes.
[9166.83s -> 9167.47s]  No one said...
[9167.47s -> 9168.03s]  Yes they did.
[9168.91s -> 9170.19s]  Yes they did.
[9170.19s -> 9171.23s]  I can hear the...
[9171.23s -> 9171.71s]  Scroll up.
[9171.71s -> 9172.51s]  You'll see it.
[9172.51s -> 9173.87s]  I want the guy that said it.
[9173.95s -> 9174.59s]  Come clean here.
[9175.23s -> 9184.61s]  This piece just won't come out.
[9186.32s -> 9187.84s]  Just perforate it already.
[9187.84s -> 9188.72s]  Why do I have to do this?
[9191.49s -> 9195.79s]  All right.
[9195.79s -> 9196.83s]  Fold it back.
[9197.39s -> 9197.63s]  Back.
[9201.39s -> 9202.19s]  Like this.
[9202.19s -> 9202.99s]  Oh this is...
[9202.99s -> 9204.75s]  I gotta be careful here for real because this will rip.
[9205.31s -> 9206.90s]  This one comes back.
[9207.78s -> 9209.10s]  This one comes back.
[9211.98s -> 9212.54s]  Oh man.
[9212.54s -> 9214.30s]  There's so many little tiny pieces here.
[9215.02s -> 9220.70s]  Okay.
[9221.42s -> 9222.06s]  Just fold them all.
[9224.75s -> 9228.93s]  What's that thing from Roblox?
[9249.54s -> 9250.98s]  Wash your hands.
[9250.98s -> 9251.70s]  Wash your hair.
[9252.42s -> 9254.40s]  What are you talking about?
[9254.40s -> 9255.20s]  My hair is clean.
[9255.84s -> 9259.38s]  I take a shower every day.
[9260.34s -> 9261.46s]  Every single day.
[9263.04s -> 9264.24s]  Every single day.
[9272.98s -> 9274.58s]  Every tiny little piece needed.
[9274.58s -> 9276.02s]  15 minutes my ass.
[9277.06s -> 9279.70s]  This even...
[9279.70s -> 9282.58s]  This little folding bit alone is going to take 15 minutes.
[9283.38s -> 9288.34s]  You don't take a shower three times a day.
[9288.34s -> 9289.86s]  Who takes a shower three times a day?
[9290.42s -> 9294.08s]  Do you work in like the mud pits?
[9294.08s -> 9294.64s]  Like I don't...
[9294.64s -> 9296.08s]  Like do you work in like the mud?
[9297.12s -> 9300.02s]  You know what I mean?
[9300.02s -> 9300.58s]  Like you got that...
[9301.14s -> 9301.54s]  You got...
[9301.54s -> 9302.02s]  That's like...
[9302.82s -> 9309.23s]  I can understand if you worked like in like a place where you need to do it.
[9309.95s -> 9312.94s]  All right.
[9312.94s -> 9313.42s]  That's done.
[9314.51s -> 9315.23s]  Now where does it go?
[9316.03s -> 9317.31s]  Wine should not be on the table.
[9317.31s -> 9318.59s]  Nice fucking walnut desk.
[9319.39s -> 9357.12s]  I can't even put it on this.
[9359.23s -> 9359.87s]  Seven minutes.
[9368.80s -> 9370.00s]  Am I doing this right?
[9370.00s -> 9370.56s]  Yes I am.
[9371.20s -> 9387.79s]  That piece sticks in there.
[9388.59s -> 9394.69s]  Right?
[9394.69s -> 9394.93s]  Okay.
[9395.57s -> 9401.79s]  Fold, fold, up.
[9401.79s -> 9405.18s]  Fold, fold, up, in.
[9405.82s -> 9407.58s]  And then what the hell does this thing do?
[9407.58s -> 9408.46s]  In and then down?
[9409.26s -> 9411.54s]  It's in.
[9411.54s -> 9412.34s]  Okay.
[9412.34s -> 9412.66s]  Look.
[9413.38s -> 9414.26s]  Examine my work.
[9416.74s -> 9416.98s]  Okay.
[9418.82s -> 9419.62s]  Now check the other side.
[9419.62s -> 9421.62s]  You should see the tip through the opening.
[9421.62s -> 9425.33s]  Do I?
[9428.19s -> 9428.59s]  Kind of.
[9429.63s -> 9430.27s]  Yeah, I do.
[9430.99s -> 9435.22s]  The main part of the key is complete.
[9435.22s -> 9439.02s]  Mine's not even kind of fucked up.
[9439.02s -> 9440.22s]  847.
[9440.22s -> 9444.77s]  Some sort of many armed alien.
[9450.11s -> 9452.03s]  This piece requires extra clean folds.
[9452.03s -> 9453.47s]  Be sure to crease carefully along the fold line.
[9453.47s -> 9454.19s]  It's just like on screen.
[9454.19s -> 9455.39s]  The end result might surprise you.
[9464.08s -> 9465.12s]  Extra clean folds.
[9465.84s -> 9468.66s]  Can you think of anything else that has four arms
[9468.66s -> 9469.22s]  and two heads?
[9469.22s -> 9469.62s]  I can't.
[9469.62s -> 9471.22s]  Are we dealing with a new life form here?
[9473.25s -> 9474.13s]  If I had wine in my mouth,
[9474.13s -> 9475.41s]  I would have spit it into the camera.
[9475.97s -> 9477.30s]  All right, hold on.
[9480.67s -> 9482.91s]  Three showers per fold.
[9490.45s -> 9491.49s]  Extra careful.
[9492.93s -> 9494.13s]  Wine drunk.
[9494.13s -> 9495.95s]  Wine is great.
[9497.33s -> 9499.17s]  You want to talk crap about wine?
[9499.17s -> 9500.77s]  You ever have a red blend before?
[9502.67s -> 9503.23s]  No.
[9503.23s -> 9508.88s]  I want to have a fucking vodka Cosmo drink.
[9509.52s -> 9510.40s]  Oh, please.
[9510.40s -> 9512.24s]  Drink a red blend, for Christ sakes.
[9517.50s -> 9517.98s]  Oh, yeah.
[9517.98s -> 9521.50s]  Do you guys make a sex on the beach?
[9522.14s -> 9524.38s]  Get fucking red blend for once in your life.
[9535.25s -> 9536.37s]  He's a mean drunk.
[9539.26s -> 9540.14s]  I'm telling you.
[9540.14s -> 9541.46s]  You'll drink cheap.
[9542.02s -> 9544.27s]  So this now goes in here.
[9544.91s -> 9547.36s]  Which way?
[9547.36s -> 9549.76s]  So the prongs out that way, like that.
[9550.32s -> 9552.78s]  And it's going to shove in 10 minutes.
[9553.58s -> 9558.32s]  See, there are two different tabs on the button.
[9558.32s -> 9560.40s]  One with a notch, one without.
[9560.40s -> 9562.16s]  Look carefully at the screen when putting it in.
[9562.96s -> 9565.07s]  I know what I'm doing.
[9565.07s -> 9567.97s]  So right through here.
[9568.69s -> 9572.58s]  I mean, it can't really go anywhere.
[9573.14s -> 9575.06s]  It just sits here like that.
[9581.90s -> 9583.50s]  Unidentified life form approaching.
[9583.50s -> 9584.30s]  Red alert.
[9584.30s -> 9584.94s]  Red blend.
[9586.82s -> 9588.18s]  Place it right over the button.
[9588.18s -> 9589.94s]  It looks right at home there, don't you think?
[9590.66s -> 9601.04s]  I mean, kind of, I guess.
[9608.75s -> 9609.63s]  That's in there.
[9609.63s -> 9610.67s]  It's not really secure, though.
[9612.58s -> 9615.70s]  Fold both of these top arms down so the tabs fit tightly into the openings.
[9615.70s -> 9617.46s]  We're starting to get this alien out of control.
[9618.42s -> 9621.97s]  Okay.
[9622.67s -> 9629.12s]  Come on, Nintendo.
[9629.84s -> 9630.88s]  You can do better than this.
[9640.58s -> 9640.90s]  Okay.
[9641.70s -> 9642.42s]  That's fine.
[9642.42s -> 9643.54s]  So that's in.
[9643.54s -> 9644.10s]  Both in.
[9644.74s -> 9646.74s]  He's riding on whatever this is.
[9650.51s -> 9651.87s]  Now, just to be sure it won't escape,
[9651.87s -> 9653.71s]  let's fold its head down between its arms.
[9654.99s -> 9657.84s]  I didn't fold these.
[9658.56s -> 9660.00s]  I don't think I do, though.
[9660.00s -> 9661.42s]  Look at that.
[9664.88s -> 9665.12s]  Ooh.
[9665.84s -> 9666.56s]  That fits nice.
[9669.25s -> 9670.93s]  Eat dinner on stream or it's pre-recorded.
[9671.89s -> 9674.43s]  I'm not going to eat fucking dinner on stream.
[9675.31s -> 9678.19s]  Fold the arms down, same thing.
[9678.19s -> 9679.47s]  We're going to do the same thing on the other side.
[9680.43s -> 9683.46s]  Eat dinner.
[9686.94s -> 9688.38s]  Why would I do something like that?
[9689.02s -> 9696.30s]  Okay.
[9696.86s -> 9698.93s]  This is kind of loose.
[9699.57s -> 9702.22s]  It's supposed to be like that.
[9707.55s -> 9712.64s]  Keep 13 minutes and 19 minutes.
[9713.44s -> 9714.24s]  Stop.
[9714.24s -> 9715.04s]  Thank you.
[9715.04s -> 9716.72s]  15 to 30 minutes, huh?
[9719.25s -> 9721.17s]  I fucking owned that.
[9721.17s -> 9727.52s]  How do I put this in?
[9728.08s -> 9734.18s]  Get the Joy-Con arm ready.
[9734.18s -> 9735.54s]  It's the one with the plus button.
[9735.54s -> 9736.82s]  Yes, I know which one it is.
[9737.70s -> 9741.81s]  I can hear the baits in my brain.
[9747.15s -> 9754.34s]  So open this slot and it looks like a Pez dispenser.
[9755.22s -> 9762.82s]  And then this goes in.
[9763.78s -> 9770.69s]  Close it and put the key in like that.
[9771.65s -> 9776.85s]  That's in.
[9778.35s -> 9783.86s]  And then close this and fold it back and stick it in there.
[9785.22s -> 9788.35s]  Done.
[9788.35s -> 9791.38s]  I win.
[9792.02s -> 9795.71s]  I win.
[9795.71s -> 9796.83s]  Try pushing the button and the key.
[9796.83s -> 9799.15s]  If it pops back out after you push it, we're good to go.
[9799.87s -> 9817.52s]  Is that?
[9817.52s -> 9818.88s]  I don't think that's good to go.
[9823.86s -> 9824.42s]  Maybe it is.
[9824.42s -> 9824.90s]  No, it is.
[9824.90s -> 9825.38s]  It is.
[9825.38s -> 9825.86s]  It is.
[9825.86s -> 9826.58s]  It's fine.
[9826.58s -> 9826.98s]  It's fine.
[9826.98s -> 9827.54s]  It's going to be fine.
[9828.34s -> 9831.10s]  Toy key is complete.
[9831.10s -> 9831.50s]  We got the key.
[9831.50s -> 9832.06s]  We got the pedal.
[9832.86s -> 9835.18s]  I'm ready to start fucking losing it.
[9835.98s -> 9836.30s]  All right.
[9836.30s -> 9837.42s]  Time to make the car.
[9840.54s -> 9841.90s]  Welcome to the next four hours.
[9842.86s -> 9861.25s]  150 to 210 minutes.
[9862.05s -> 9868.27s]  See you guys in the next 10 hours.
[9869.31s -> 9870.03s]  I'm doing it all.
[9870.67s -> 9871.60s]  You know what I mean?
[9872.70s -> 9874.30s]  I don't care how long this takes.
[9875.10s -> 9885.14s]  I'll be here in one spring.
[9885.95s -> 9887.23s]  This is not turning off until it's done.
[9887.87s -> 9891.65s]  I'm fucking ready.
[9920.54s -> 9920.94s]  Let's go.
[9921.98s -> 9922.54s]  Wheel.
[9922.54s -> 9923.34s]  Wheel base.
[9923.34s -> 9923.90s]  Wheel.
[9923.90s -> 9924.62s]  Seven steps.
[9925.34s -> 9926.30s]  Make the steering wheel.
[9927.10s -> 9929.31s]  Remove this one piece from sheet A.
[9929.31s -> 9931.23s]  It'll form the steering wheel for your car.
[9934.58s -> 9937.22s]  For some reason, my changer sucks.
[9937.22s -> 9938.98s]  I can't like, gotta do it the right way.
[9940.24s -> 9940.88s]  There we go.
[9940.88s -> 9943.14s]  I got it.
[9943.14s -> 9944.66s]  I need to like figure this out.
[9944.66s -> 9944.90s]  All right.
[9944.90s -> 9947.38s]  Don't forget if you have a fucking problem, call somebody.
[9948.02s -> 9955.78s]  You'll be able to play Adventure as soon as you finish building the Toy-Con car.
[9956.83s -> 9957.47s]  Adventure.
[9958.03s -> 9958.67s]  What does that mean?
[9962.21s -> 9963.09s]  Family circus.
[9964.56s -> 9966.88s]  I can't, guys, here's the fucking problem.
[9966.88s -> 9968.32s]  I can't skip.
[9968.32s -> 9974.94s]  I can't go fast because the key is in here.
[9974.94s -> 9975.82s]  What piece do I need?
[9979.25s -> 9980.61s]  Oh, he did a funny noise.
[9980.61s -> 9983.81s]  Now I'm making a call back to the fucking dumb family circus thing I said like
[9983.81s -> 9984.61s]  four hours ago.
[9988.19s -> 9990.83s]  So I need the whole entire enterprise here.
[9992.00s -> 10007.22s]  The whole thing is huge.
[10008.02s -> 10013.09s]  I gotta get the whole pizza.
[10016.30s -> 10017.18s]  He just elbowed me.
[10018.38s -> 10021.28s]  Come on.
[10021.28s -> 10022.00s]  No.
[10022.00s -> 10027.98s]  That's it for this piece.
[10027.98s -> 10029.02s]  There's nothing else in here.
[10031.30s -> 10032.66s]  Just a spike trap now.
[10034.32s -> 10034.64s]  Okay.
[10035.60s -> 10036.16s]  There it is.
[10036.88s -> 10039.94s]  I hate that it's in here.
[10039.94s -> 10040.66s]  Get it out of here.
[10040.66s -> 10041.46s]  I'll put it in later.
[10042.18s -> 10044.91s]  Fuck off for an hour.
[10045.63s -> 10046.38s]  All right.
[10046.38s -> 10047.34s]  Here's the steering wheel.
[10047.34s -> 10048.30s]  Let's put it together.
[10048.30s -> 10050.62s]  Don't forget if you have any trouble, you can use the back and forward buttons.
[10050.62s -> 10050.86s]  Sure.
[10050.86s -> 10052.46s]  You'll be able to punch these out.
[10053.50s -> 10058.11s]  Pizza box, Labo, all over again.
[10062.66s -> 10063.38s]  Why is everybody freaking out?
[10063.38s -> 10063.88s]  What happened?
[10065.71s -> 10067.39s]  Like, why is everybody, what's wrong?
[10067.39s -> 10068.19s]  Why is everybody freaking out?
[10068.99s -> 10075.89s]  There's so many random pieces to pull out of here.
[10076.53s -> 10077.81s]  I was rude.
[10077.81s -> 10079.09s]  Wait, what did I, what did I do?
[10079.09s -> 10079.65s]  What did I say?
[10080.53s -> 10082.53s]  What did I, what did I say?
[10082.53s -> 10083.09s]  I was mean?
[10083.09s -> 10083.73s]  How was I mean?
[10083.73s -> 10084.21s]  What did I say?
[10089.28s -> 10090.40s]  I yelled at the key.
[10094.16s -> 10095.68s]  Oh, I'm sorry, key.
[10097.04s -> 10098.48s]  I'm so rude to you.
[10099.12s -> 10102.38s]  I just ripped it.
[10103.10s -> 10108.26s]  Fuck off for an hour.
[10108.26s -> 10110.98s]  I was talking, I was talking to the key and not, what?
[10110.98s -> 10113.66s]  There's so many little pieces.
[10114.62s -> 10116.78s]  I'm gonna have a field day fucking cleaning this up.
[10116.78s -> 10118.54s]  And I said I didn't want to mess this room up.
[10120.06s -> 10122.06s]  And here we are, messing the room up.
[10123.04s -> 10123.68s]  What do you know?
[10124.56s -> 10125.44s]  What else is new?
[10127.26s -> 10129.18s]  Different states, same bullshit.
[10131.58s -> 10132.86s]  Still ruining rooms.
[10133.82s -> 10134.46s]  2018.
[10135.58s -> 10144.82s]  Is that it?
[10144.82s -> 10146.93s]  This middle thing has to come out somehow.
[10150.10s -> 10151.46s]  Can the middle thing even come out?
[10152.18s -> 10156.86s]  Okay.
[10156.86s -> 10160.18s]  I mean, it's getting close.
[10161.06s -> 10164.50s]  Oh, all the HDMI ports have to come out.
[10172.32s -> 10174.00s]  All the HDMI ports have to come out.
[10174.00s -> 10174.50s]  2018.
[10175.28s -> 10190.74s]  Looking closer, right?
[10190.74s -> 10192.42s]  One, two, three, and all the pieces.
[10192.42s -> 10193.38s]  Just these corners.
[10194.02s -> 10195.30s]  These corners come out too.
[10200.08s -> 10200.96s]  Are you stoned?
[10202.38s -> 10203.18s]  I don't think so.
[10203.98s -> 10207.09s]  I don't believe I am.
[10207.09s -> 10207.73s]  I don't think so.
[10212.13s -> 10212.53s]  Fuck it.
[10212.53s -> 10212.85s]  Whatever.
[10212.85s -> 10213.73s]  That's fine.
[10213.73s -> 10232.16s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[10232.16s -> 10234.56s]  You missed an HDMI?
[10234.56s -> 10234.88s]  Fuck it.
[10234.88s -> 10235.44s]  We'll be fine.
[10238.13s -> 10238.85s]  Okay, let's go.
[10242.51s -> 10245.23s]  Before we turn the piece off, we'll want to crease
[10246.35s -> 10248.03s]  the four lines on these four tabs.
[10248.03s -> 10249.23s]  Boop, boop, boop, boopity boop.
[10249.23s -> 10250.03s]  That's all four.
[10250.03s -> 10250.53s]  Okay.
[10251.07s -> 10263.82s]  That wasn't a funny voice.
[10264.99s -> 10266.43s]  Guys, I wouldn't be doing this.
[10266.43s -> 10268.27s]  I would be doing this if I was alone too.
[10268.27s -> 10269.79s]  I would be saying Thanos lines.
[10270.59s -> 10273.71s]  It's done.
[10273.71s -> 10275.25s]  Flip the whole thing around.
[10275.81s -> 10281.74s]  Just gives us this.
[10287.36s -> 10289.52s]  Got any more brain busters, Nintendo?
[10290.16s -> 10293.26s]  Oh, whoops.
[10300.61s -> 10303.10s]  We got five more gifted subs.
[10304.05s -> 10306.45s]  Five gifted subs from Bet3.
[10306.45s -> 10307.33s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[10313.55s -> 10316.35s]  Even more subs on top of the ones that were from before.
[10316.35s -> 10317.15s]  Thank you guys so much.
[10317.15s -> 10318.75s]  You guys are fucking amazing.
[10318.75s -> 10319.07s]  Thank you.
[10321.39s -> 10321.89s]  Bet3.
[10323.10s -> 10324.38s]  Fold every single one of these.
[10325.02s -> 10325.52s]  God.
[10326.22s -> 10329.26s]  Can I put this in a machine and have it do it for me?
[10340.42s -> 10341.38s]  Buy it pre-made.
[10344.02s -> 10344.82s]  One skit.
[10344.82s -> 10346.26s]  I gotta go all the way around.
[10346.26s -> 10347.22s]  It's gotta do it, you know?
[10347.22s -> 10348.18s]  You gotta put your pants on.
[10348.18s -> 10348.66s]  You gotta do it.
[10349.70s -> 10353.04s]  It does sound really nice when you do it each time, though.
[10355.86s -> 10357.46s]  So I have a question for everybody that's here.
[10358.10s -> 10361.23s]  Am I the only person on Twitch that's done this?
[10361.79s -> 10363.23s]  On stream like the whole thing?
[10363.23s -> 10363.73s]  All of them?
[10368.91s -> 10369.63s]  No.
[10369.63s -> 10372.77s]  I want to meet that person.
[10375.74s -> 10377.98s]  Matters of Darkness came in with five community subs.
[10377.98s -> 10378.70s]  Thank you so much.
[10382.58s -> 10384.58s]  You are literally the only person to ever do it.
[10386.32s -> 10389.68s]  That's big, big community subs coming in from Matters of Darkness.
[10389.68s -> 10391.12s]  On top of the ones from earlier.
[10391.12s -> 10392.00s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[10392.80s -> 10393.52s]  I don't want to-
[10393.52s -> 10394.80s]  I really don't know what to say at this point.
[10394.80s -> 10396.40s]  You guys are fucking too much for me.
[10399.46s -> 10401.22s]  You're not the first, but you're definitely the slowest.
[10402.02s -> 10425.94s]  How many total community subs tonight?
[10425.94s -> 10427.22s]  Probably 150.
[10428.10s -> 10428.82s]  Something crazy.
[10430.62s -> 10432.06s]  Go around the inner circle.
[10436.03s -> 10436.51s]  And the-
[10436.51s -> 10436.99s]  In the-
[10436.99s -> 10437.95s]  In the core, too?
[10437.95s -> 10438.99s]  We gotta go in the core!
[10439.95s -> 10465.50s]  Look how patronizing he's being when this wheel is trying its best.
[10466.62s -> 10471.65s]  That's one of my favorite comment of the whole night.
[10472.37s -> 10473.01s]  That was great.
[10473.65s -> 10474.37s]  All right, let's go.
[10475.57s -> 10480.29s]  Each individual piece has to come up.
[10481.01s -> 10485.28s]  I'm gonna feel so satisfied
[10486.00s -> 10489.60s]  when I smash this with the sledgehammer that's back there in the closet.
[10490.40s -> 10490.88s]  You didn't know?
[10490.88s -> 10492.56s]  That's the big joke at the end of the stream.
[10493.20s -> 10494.08s]  Sludgehammer?
[10495.20s -> 10496.72s]  He bought a sledgehammer for this?
[10497.44s -> 10498.72s]  Yeah, he sure did.
[10499.84s -> 10501.44s]  And boy, is it gonna be messy.
[10512.50s -> 10513.30s]  Whoa, cool.
[10513.30s -> 10516.26s]  Whoa, holy shit, he sledgehammered the labo.
[10516.26s -> 10517.30s]  What the-
[10517.30s -> 10519.06s]  He still has it in his hand.
[10519.06s -> 10520.58s]  The adrenaline's like getting to him.
[10520.58s -> 10521.06s]  Wait, hold on.
[10521.06s -> 10522.74s]  He's sledgehammering his computer.
[10523.62s -> 10524.58s]  What the fuck?
[10524.58s -> 10525.14s]  What face?
[10525.94s -> 10528.35s]  Did I break it?
[10528.35s -> 10528.91s]  No.
[10528.91s -> 10530.66s]  Did I?
[10530.66s -> 10532.58s]  Dude, he sledgehammered his computer?
[10532.58s -> 10534.10s]  Dude, he's sledgehammering his walls.
[10534.98s -> 10536.34s]  What the fuck face?
[10542.06s -> 10543.34s]  Everything has to happen.
[10543.34s -> 10549.90s]  Dude, he ran off camera
[10549.90s -> 10551.82s]  and I still hear crashing and smashing.
[10552.38s -> 10591.17s]  Whoa!
[10591.17s -> 10592.69s]  There's that HDMI port I missed.
[10592.69s -> 10594.98s]  I should just do these at the same time.
[10594.98s -> 10596.90s]  This is gonna feel really cool putting it together though
[10596.90s -> 10598.74s]  because all these slots have a home.
[10602.98s -> 10604.34s]  Every single slot has a home.
[10605.66s -> 10606.46s]  They-
[10606.46s -> 10608.46s]  Slots go this way and they go into their home.
[10612.80s -> 10613.52s]  One of my fucking-
[10614.32s -> 10615.20s]  Can I show you something?
[10617.04s -> 10618.16s]  I can't.
[10618.16s -> 10618.88s]  Almost all-
[10618.88s -> 10621.28s]  Half of my fucking wall paneling is falling down.
[10624.54s -> 10625.98s]  Command strips, don't do shit.
[10629.73s -> 10630.77s]  Another one just fell down.
[10633.66s -> 10635.66s]  Okay, we are done.
[10636.46s -> 10637.74s]  It's time to put it all together.
[10639.81s -> 10644.59s]  Here's the 130 minute stream that they were describing.
[10645.65s -> 10649.33s]  They weren't kidding around when they said it was gonna take 130 stream minutes.
[10650.05s -> 10652.13s]  Put it all together, right?
[10653.78s -> 10654.66s]  Or wrong?
[10654.66s -> 10660.74s]  Good red blend.
[10664.45s -> 10664.77s]  Wrong.
[10665.33s -> 10676.19s]  Okay, this comes up and then these go down.
[10685.54s -> 10685.86s]  That.
[10689.50s -> 10691.82s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10691.82s -> 10692.78s]  It's the second one.
[10693.58s -> 10696.34s]  So this is, you know, in the middle.
[10697.22s -> 10698.90s]  I feel like I'm gonna get cut.
[10698.90s -> 10700.02s]  This is like a saw blade.
[10701.58s -> 10715.34s]  That comes down and then these pieces here fold like that.
[10715.34s -> 10717.42s]  And then in.
[10717.42s -> 10717.92s]  Oy.
[10718.70s -> 10719.64s]  Oy.
[10720.78s -> 10721.28s]  In.
[10722.72s -> 10723.22s]  In.
[10723.84s -> 10729.98s]  There's so many tabs to put in.
[10734.78s -> 10737.90s]  Nintendo Labo like katana saw blade.
[10742.18s -> 10743.30s]  Fatality.
[10743.30s -> 10746.74s]  Just do them all.
[10749.10s -> 10751.58s]  Did I, did it flip over?
[10752.14s -> 10762.91s]  Why did, did I do this wrong?
[10768.03s -> 10772.70s]  No.
[10772.70s -> 10773.18s]  Friendship.
[10773.74s -> 10774.30s]  Friendship.
[10774.86s -> 10775.36s]  Again.
[10785.34s -> 10786.22s]  Blind streamer.
[10786.22s -> 10786.62s]  Blind.
[10786.62s -> 10787.34s]  Blind streamer.
[10787.34s -> 10787.82s]  He's blind.
[10787.82s -> 10788.38s]  He's blind.
[10788.38s -> 10788.78s]  Blind.
[10788.78s -> 10789.82s]  He's blind.
[10789.82s -> 10792.59s]  That's an unknown reference.
[10792.59s -> 10795.39s]  Go play Mortal Kombat 3, you fucking idiot.
[10796.03s -> 10801.63s]  You know, I'm kidding.
[10801.63s -> 10802.27s]  That was a joke.
[10807.55s -> 10808.91s]  I'm, that was, I'm kidding.
[10808.91s -> 10809.55s]  I'm kidding.
[10809.55s -> 10811.04s]  I'm kidding.
[10813.36s -> 10814.40s]  He's getting toxic.
[10815.04s -> 10818.19s]  The more wine he drinks, he becomes more toxic.
[10823.04s -> 10825.04s]  No, that's in Mortal Kombat 3.
[10825.04s -> 10828.96s]  I was just kidding.
[10828.96s -> 10830.08s]  Look, hey, come on.
[10835.47s -> 10836.91s]  Rewind to yesterday.
[10838.72s -> 10840.56s]  Oh, sleepy.
[10844.24s -> 10847.92s]  Everybody calls me an idiot when I'm like walking around in Red Dead.
[10848.88s -> 10850.32s]  Oh wow, you're an idiot.
[10850.88s -> 10853.39s]  Why is that okay?
[10854.03s -> 10864.43s]  He sounds so, I'm kidding.
[10868.30s -> 10874.05s]  Stop ignoring my question.
[10874.05s -> 10875.41s]  Tell us your sub count.
[10875.41s -> 10876.77s]  I don't, I don't know.
[10876.77s -> 10877.25s]  What is it?
[10878.91s -> 10879.95s]  65,000.
[10883.81s -> 10885.73s]  Like, I'm not ignoring your, what?
[10885.73s -> 10886.93s]  Stop ignoring my question.
[10886.93s -> 10888.53s]  How much money is in your bank account?
[10889.09s -> 10894.69s]  I'm probably gonna have to do all these, right?
[10902.88s -> 10904.56s]  Yeah, I've got to do every single one.
[10910.32s -> 10911.44s]  That's more than everybody here.
[10911.44s -> 10913.28s]  Yeah, there's like 3,000 people there.
[10913.28s -> 10922.13s]  That's correct, right?
[10923.39s -> 10923.95s]  I think so.
[10926.03s -> 10926.59s]  Yep, right.
[10926.59s -> 10927.87s]  You knew it was gonna have to happen, right?
[10933.25s -> 10933.97s]  Tax returns.
[10944.59s -> 10945.47s]  Look out.
[10945.47s -> 10947.31s]  Oh, a plane went by?
[10947.31s -> 10947.81s]  Yeah.
[10948.53s -> 10949.17s]  Vegas, man.
[10950.53s -> 10952.05s]  People all over the place.
[10952.77s -> 10958.54s]  I heard a cat outside yesterday.
[10960.19s -> 10962.75s]  That, I thought it was like a weird like high-pitched voice.
[10962.75s -> 10963.39s]  And I was like, what the fuck?
[10963.39s -> 10965.84s]  It was like, give me all your money.
[10965.84s -> 10966.96s]  And I was like, what the fuck is this?
[10967.60s -> 10968.88s]  It was high-pitched.
[10968.88s -> 10970.96s]  And I went and said it was a cat holding somebody up on the street.
[10971.76s -> 10973.25s]  It made no sense.
[10973.25s -> 10974.05s]  And he had an eye patch.
[10974.69s -> 10979.55s]  I was like, holy shit, we're in Vegas, man.
[10982.29s -> 10982.79s]  Done.
[10986.64s -> 10987.36s]  In an iPad.
[10988.32s -> 10989.12s]  All right, that's it.
[10989.92s -> 10995.71s]  That was just a Jay Leno joke.
[10997.82s -> 10998.78s]  Yeah, it was.
[10999.42s -> 11019.46s]  He probably made that already.
[11025.18s -> 11025.82s]  Don't look at me.
[11026.38s -> 11027.50s]  I'm not here.
[11027.50s -> 11028.59s]  I got a cup though.
[11028.59s -> 11029.63s]  You see that cup?
[11029.63s -> 11032.38s]  Pretty deep.
[11032.38s -> 11034.78s]  All right, we're on step two of already step two.
[11034.78s -> 11035.42s]  We're getting there.
[11044.05s -> 11045.57s]  A place to put these when they're done.
[11046.21s -> 11048.00s]  That could go right down there.
[11048.00s -> 11049.28s]  I need B and C.
[11051.71s -> 11059.63s]  Why does Jerma always over-emote?
[11061.89s -> 11062.29s]  What?
[11062.29s -> 11062.93s]  Over-emote?
[11062.93s -> 11070.74s]  What do you mean over-emote?
[11070.74s -> 11071.38s]  Over-act?
[11071.94s -> 11072.50s]  Over-emote?
[11072.50s -> 11074.02s]  I don't know what you mean over-emote.
[11074.02s -> 11081.65s]  Empty.
[11081.65s -> 11088.58s]  And this laundry dryer washer thing.
[11090.70s -> 11092.38s]  Stop over-emoting.
[11095.89s -> 11097.73s]  I haven't typed anything in the chat at all.
[11098.29s -> 11101.60s]  I've been talking to you guys, but you know.
[11102.32s -> 11107.76s]  So this is, I'm going to assume, is part of the base of the wheel.
[11107.76s -> 11108.00s]  Right?
[11111.76s -> 11114.24s]  Emo-streamer wants to be Nightwing, but he's too fat.
[11114.96s -> 11126.40s]  All right, flipping around.
[11126.40s -> 11128.96s]  All the folds, every single one, all the HDMI's have to come out.
[11129.92s -> 11139.18s]  When is my collab with Critical?
[11144.13s -> 11145.01s]  Right now.
[11145.01s -> 11148.05s]  Welcome into the chat, guys.
[11148.05s -> 11149.65s]  I have him on Discord here.
[11149.65s -> 11150.77s]  Critical, say hello.
[11151.33s -> 11167.39s]  Critical.
[11167.39s -> 11172.80s]  You hear him, man?
[11172.80s -> 11174.64s]  Ah, I must have had a scheduling conflict with him.
[11174.64s -> 11176.00s]  I must have had a scheduling conflict with him.
[11176.64s -> 11177.66s]  Shit, hello.
[11193.94s -> 11195.22s]  No, I was going to hit him up, actually.
[11195.94s -> 11198.10s]  I was going to hit him up very soon.
[11198.90s -> 11209.55s]  When am I going to stream with Logic, Rick Morty, and Ninja?
[11211.71s -> 11220.70s]  That's all I got to say about that, is just, oi.
[11224.35s -> 11224.99s]  All right.
[11224.99s -> 11227.47s]  So, make sure I'm doing all this right.
[11227.47s -> 11233.63s]  This tab has to come up.
[11235.63s -> 11241.68s]  When are you going to collab with Jerma?
[11242.56s -> 11244.13s]  No, that guy over emotes.
[11244.13s -> 11246.37s]  I don't think I want to be in the same stream as him.
[11247.09s -> 11249.39s]  He has a really commanding presence.
[11249.39s -> 11251.47s]  He over talks and talks over everybody.
[11252.67s -> 11254.88s]  I don't follow his humor that really at all.
[11263.92s -> 11264.56s]  I like Jerma.
[11264.56s -> 11268.67s]  Jerma's not bad, but like, it gets to a point, man.
[11269.31s -> 11273.22s]  You have anything else besides, like, I'll try to do the voice.
[11273.22s -> 11274.50s]  Like, don't have any cards, I guess.
[11274.50s -> 11275.54s]  Like, he does it all the time.
[11275.54s -> 11277.30s]  It's like, you have any other tricks up your sleeve, dude?
[11278.34s -> 11281.90s]  That is not meant to be like mean to him or anything.
[11281.90s -> 11282.94s]  I think he's like, cool.
[11282.94s -> 11283.58s]  I think he's funny.
[11285.50s -> 11290.56s]  I saw his Castle Griffith Steed video.
[11290.56s -> 11291.44s]  I mean, that was pretty cool.
[11292.16s -> 11297.63s]  I heard he pays for bots to view his channel.
[11303.54s -> 11304.74s]  I'm going to go down that road.
[11305.30s -> 11306.02s]  All right, let's go.
[11306.82s -> 11313.55s]  Unsubbing, because you hate him.
[11314.50s -> 11315.22s]  No, I don't hate him.
[11315.22s -> 11316.26s]  He's like, cool, I like him.
[11321.15s -> 11325.94s]  Am I going to play Smash with Vinny?
[11326.98s -> 11328.18s]  Fuck yeah, if he wants to.
[11328.82s -> 11331.36s]  When Smash comes out, I'll play it with anybody.
[11331.36s -> 11332.16s]  Because they're actually going to have,
[11333.28s -> 11334.64s]  they'll have regional matchmaking,
[11334.64s -> 11336.40s]  which is something that they've like never done before.
[11336.40s -> 11337.28s]  So that's huge.
[11338.16s -> 11347.52s]  Plus, you ever spend more than a couple days
[11347.52s -> 11348.64s]  in somebody's dryer before?
[11350.40s -> 11350.88s]  Not fun.
[11351.68s -> 11354.74s]  I mean, I spelt real clean when I came up.
[11354.74s -> 11355.78s]  I'll be honest with you.
[11356.34s -> 11358.13s]  Every so often, he would, it was weird,
[11358.13s -> 11359.33s]  because he would turn the dryer on.
[11360.13s -> 11362.69s]  I was in there for probably 12 hours at a time.
[11363.49s -> 11365.57s]  And he would turn the dryer on.
[11365.57s -> 11367.25s]  And I'd be fucking flipping around and shit.
[11367.25s -> 11368.53s]  He would throw a couple sheets in there.
[11369.09s -> 11371.57s]  And he'd be like, you smell pretty fresh, don't you?
[11371.57s -> 11373.65s]  And I'd be like, fuck, I guess I do.
[11373.65s -> 11375.01s]  He'd throw hamburger meat in there,
[11375.01s -> 11376.21s]  and the heat from the,
[11377.57s -> 11379.65s]  the heat from the dryer would actually cook it.
[11379.65s -> 11382.37s]  So I would have to wait probably maybe 20 or 30 minutes
[11382.37s -> 11384.29s]  for the raw hamburger meat to spin around with me
[11384.29s -> 11385.49s]  until it was cooked enough where I could eat it.
[11385.49s -> 11386.53s]  So I mean, he was nice enough.
[11387.25s -> 11388.53s]  He like helped me out a little bit there.
[11397.34s -> 11398.38s]  Both sides there, yeah.
[11399.76s -> 11401.04s]  Same, oh, I didn't, whoops.
[11401.92s -> 11419.25s]  Fucked that up down here.
[11420.53s -> 11423.31s]  Who's my smash man?
[11423.31s -> 11423.87s]  It's Pac-Man.
[11424.51s -> 11432.42s]  I mean, I was going to say Gino, but whatever.
[11433.06s -> 11436.46s]  Life sucks, apparently, for Gino.
[11437.18s -> 11441.49s]  There we go.
[11442.13s -> 11444.91s]  This comes down.
[11445.71s -> 11448.48s]  Yeah, I was one of those people
[11448.48s -> 11450.48s]  that thought the Grinch leak was real.
[11451.36s -> 11453.49s]  And I was like, oh my god,
[11453.49s -> 11454.93s]  this is going to be the best game ever made.
[11454.93s -> 11456.13s]  And then you got to remember, it's,
[11457.41s -> 11458.69s]  everyone I was just trying to fuck with you
[11458.69s -> 11459.65s]  before a game comes out.
[11460.29s -> 11460.93s]  Of course you did.
[11460.93s -> 11463.41s]  Well, I mean, it looked really, it looked so real.
[11463.97s -> 11465.41s]  There was so much backstory.
[11465.97s -> 11468.21s]  So much time went into somebody making that leak
[11468.21s -> 11470.69s]  that it was just like impossible for it to be fake.
[11471.57s -> 11472.45s]  And here we are.
[11480.91s -> 11485.07s]  Did I, same thing on this side too.
[11492.06s -> 11493.10s]  Smash characters.
[11493.98s -> 11497.42s]  Uh, no, but I mean, Pac-Man, it's always Pac-Man, right?
[11497.42s -> 11499.26s]  Pac-Man is just always cool.
[11501.98s -> 11503.74s]  A couple of other characters look interesting.
[11504.38s -> 11506.16s]  I don't have to give spoilers or anything,
[11506.16s -> 11508.96s]  but there's a certain plant-based hero
[11508.96s -> 11510.64s]  that looks really stupid.
[11511.52s -> 11512.48s]  Kind of right up my alley.
[11513.36s -> 11521.63s]  Uh, okay, check the six little tabs
[11521.63s -> 11522.67s]  we popped into the openings.
[11522.67s -> 11523.87s]  If they haven't all popped into place,
[11523.87s -> 11524.67s]  go back and fix them.
[11525.71s -> 11527.07s]  I mean, these, this looks right.
[11529.22s -> 11529.94s]  Just going to go like this.
[11529.94s -> 11535.23s]  And then we're going to get this piece.
[11536.43s -> 11541.28s]  Uh, it's going to be a shit character.
[11542.00s -> 11547.07s]  Well, we'll see what they do for DLC.
[11548.50s -> 11550.74s]  Because apparently, they already have a plan for DLC.
[11550.74s -> 11557.62s]  I guess still, who else is left to put in that game?
[11557.62s -> 11558.18s]  You know what I mean?
[11559.14s -> 11563.25s]  They have every single Nintendo character ever.
[11563.25s -> 11566.29s]  Has spirits and trophies and characters.
[11566.29s -> 11567.41s]  Like, what the fuck?
[11567.41s -> 11569.25s]  There's five more characters they want to put in.
[11570.05s -> 11578.86s]  Third party?
[11580.19s -> 11582.67s]  Yeah, I mean, I'd be nice if one of those
[11582.67s -> 11588.53s]  third party characters was, you know, Gino.
[11589.95s -> 11591.15s]  Technically third party character.
[11591.79s -> 11597.84s]  Let's see here.
[11597.84s -> 11598.80s]  Carl Griffinstein.
[11600.38s -> 11601.82s]  If Nintendo ever hit me up to like,
[11601.82s -> 11603.50s]  pay for the rights of Carl Griffinstein.
[11604.32s -> 11605.92s]  Oh, excuse me, Mr. Albertson.
[11605.92s -> 11609.60s]  Yes, I'm writing this email to offer you a lump sum.
[11609.60s -> 11612.56s]  I have a reply to the email as fast as I could.
[11612.56s -> 11613.76s]  I don't even care what the amount was.
[11613.76s -> 11615.44s]  And I'd be like, yes, yes, yes.
[11616.16s -> 11619.36s]  They'd be like, take it, take it now, take it.
[11620.00s -> 11621.57s]  How many bits is that?
[11621.57s -> 11622.45s]  How much is that in bits?
[11631.42s -> 11633.84s]  One dollar would be worth it.
[11633.84s -> 11640.99s]  Am I putting this in the right way?
[11640.99s -> 11644.96s]  It's got a snap in there.
[11650.90s -> 11652.10s]  Paid you in potato chips.
[11652.10s -> 11652.66s]  It'd be worth it.
[11652.66s -> 11686.34s]  I never have to buy them ever again.
[11686.34s -> 11687.06s]  Easy.
[11687.06s -> 11691.82s]  You should do a rumble of all the Smash characters.
[11693.10s -> 11693.98s]  That's a lot.
[11693.98s -> 11694.86s]  That's a lot of characters.
[11698.06s -> 11699.10s]  Steering wheel has a seat.
[11700.93s -> 11703.41s]  So we need to move that down here because that's done.
[11705.20s -> 11705.92s]  C and D again.
[11711.01s -> 11712.85s]  Everything else from all of it, the whole thing.
[11713.41s -> 11720.43s]  I lose it.
[11720.43s -> 11721.15s]  Where did it just go?
[11722.13s -> 11722.77s]  Where did that go?
[11723.87s -> 11725.07s]  Oh, it's all the way down there.
[11725.95s -> 11743.23s]  And the two pieces down here.
[11744.11s -> 11747.52s]  How's the elaborate pie box going?
[11747.52s -> 11748.88s]  Actually, it's going pretty well.
[11749.68s -> 11750.72s]  I think it's going pretty well.
[11751.36s -> 11752.08s]  What do you guys think?
[11754.22s -> 11756.06s]  You guys think it's going well so far?
[11760.54s -> 11762.14s]  A Labo stream without alcohol.
[11762.14s -> 11762.62s]  What kind?
[11763.26s -> 11763.90s]  Excuse me.
[11764.62s -> 11814.42s]  You were saying something.
[11816.26s -> 11824.86s]  Show the box.
[11824.86s -> 11825.74s]  I showed the box earlier.
[11825.74s -> 11826.54s]  It's black box.
[11828.42s -> 11829.54s]  That's pretty good.
[11829.54s -> 11832.35s]  Is that sangria?
[11832.35s -> 11833.39s]  No, it's a red blend.
[11833.39s -> 11835.15s]  It's California red blend from black box.
[11835.95s -> 11838.03s]  Cheap, affordable, tastes great.
[11838.91s -> 11845.62s]  Why am I turning them all over?
[11845.62s -> 11846.18s]  What are you doing?
[11848.80s -> 11849.76s]  And then we need something from D.
[11850.48s -> 11855.82s]  The whole thing?
[11855.82s -> 11857.34s]  No, just this left part.
[11866.91s -> 11872.18s]  Oh, put a sponsor warning in the title.
[11872.18s -> 11873.62s]  I'm not sponsored by black box.
[11873.62s -> 11874.90s]  I just bought it and like it.
[11875.78s -> 11876.26s]  That's it.
[11876.98s -> 11885.66s]  Do you really even have to like it?
[11889.52s -> 11890.56s]  Chill, chill.
[11891.36s -> 11895.60s]  What, like you guys don't drink wine
[11895.60s -> 11897.52s]  if you're above the age of 21.
[11898.24s -> 11901.02s]  You never had wine before in your life
[11901.02s -> 11902.54s]  and you want a decent alternative
[11902.54s -> 11905.42s]  to buying like a $50 bottle of wine
[11905.42s -> 11907.18s]  and it is three liters in here.
[11908.38s -> 11910.22s]  And it's quality wine.
[11910.94s -> 11921.49s]  A funny story here.
[11922.13s -> 11924.22s]  The guy that helps produce
[11924.22s -> 11925.50s]  a lot of the video stuff
[11925.50s -> 11926.70s]  and the guy that helped me make
[11926.70s -> 11927.90s]  almost the whole rumble.
[11929.58s -> 11931.50s]  We bought this and we wrote
[11931.50s -> 11933.02s]  the whole rumble drink
[11933.02s -> 11934.54s]  in the whole box of black box wine.
[11935.58s -> 11941.28s]  We also wrote four other skits
[11941.28s -> 11945.84s]  and ideas completely drinking this one.
[11946.64s -> 11947.68s]  So it's kind of like a little,
[11948.48s -> 11950.48s]  it's my heart somewhere, you know.
[11950.48s -> 11961.73s]  It's funny juice.
[11961.73s -> 11962.37s]  Buy it up.
[11963.92s -> 11965.52s]  The bits circled in the picture below
[11965.52s -> 11966.72s]  shouldn't be folded.
[11966.72s -> 11968.16s]  There's a reason they don't have fold lines.
[11968.88s -> 11969.84s]  All right.
[11969.84s -> 11970.56s]  I didn't fold them.
[11971.28s -> 11972.00s]  Maybe I did.
[11972.00s -> 11972.48s]  What, what?
[11973.20s -> 11975.92s]  Okay.
[11975.92s -> 11977.36s]  Well, I got apparently I do fold.
[11988.18s -> 11989.38s]  I once, honey chain says
[11989.38s -> 11991.30s]  I once drank an entire bottle of wine
[11991.30s -> 11992.58s]  and puked all over my friend's porch
[11992.58s -> 11994.34s]  and then he power bombed me through the sink.
[11995.79s -> 11996.99s]  Well, I believe the first half
[11996.99s -> 11998.35s]  but the second half was sensationalized
[11998.35s -> 11999.39s]  to make it seem like it was like,
[11999.39s -> 12000.91s]  wow, it's crazy.
[12000.91s -> 12002.03s]  I don't think the second part happened.
[12002.03s -> 12003.47s]  Yeah, I think you puked on your friend's sink in you.
[12004.43s -> 12008.35s]  Um, you know, you're trying to sensationalize
[12008.35s -> 12021.82s]  a little bit because you called him out.
[12021.82s -> 12025.73s]  I believe him.
[12025.73s -> 12027.57s]  You're the only one that's allowed to make things up.
[12027.57s -> 12028.45s]  I'm the only one that's allowed
[12028.45s -> 12030.45s]  to lie and make things up here.
[12030.45s -> 12031.25s]  Don't you understand?
[12040.00s -> 12045.02s]  One dollar.
[12045.02s -> 12046.62s]  You sound presidential.
[12048.22s -> 12048.94s]  Oh, fuck.
[12050.35s -> 12051.15s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[12053.95s -> 12054.93s]  Move on.
[12055.49s -> 12064.45s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[12064.45s -> 12066.72s]  Thank you.
[12066.72s -> 12070.21s]  Hey, hey, okay.
[12070.21s -> 12070.69s]  We're good.
[12070.69s -> 12077.82s]  Let's fold it down.
[12077.82s -> 12078.14s]  I did.
[12078.70s -> 12079.42s]  This one too.
[12079.42s -> 12079.92s]  I did.
[12085.76s -> 12087.04s]  I just heard my dog bark at me.
[12087.60s -> 12089.78s]  Otto just said like, hey, shut the fuck up.
[12089.78s -> 12090.82s]  He's like downstairs.
[12092.37s -> 12094.29s]  These both, these all come down.
[12094.29s -> 12095.33s]  Those come all the way down.
[12095.33s -> 12096.21s]  Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[12096.21s -> 12097.01s]  These tabs come up.
[12097.97s -> 12110.37s]  Like this, like that, like that.
[12112.02s -> 12112.52s]  Sick.
[12115.30s -> 12116.74s]  That square is not going anywhere.
[12116.74s -> 12118.18s]  Next, roll up the first loopy,
[12118.18s -> 12119.54s]  rectangular bit so that the tab
[12119.54s -> 12120.90s]  comes down to the rest of the room.
[12134.58s -> 12136.10s]  It's not in there really securely though.
[12136.74s -> 12137.86s]  You know what I mean?
[12137.86s -> 12138.36s]  Like, fuck.
[12139.94s -> 12140.82s]  You demand a ho-ho.
[12141.70s -> 12142.98s]  So eat a ho-ho.
[12142.98s -> 12143.86s]  Go to a convenience store
[12143.86s -> 12145.94s]  and get a fucking, get a Yahoo,
[12145.94s -> 12146.58s]  whatever they're called.
[12148.30s -> 12149.42s]  The tab's poking out.
[12150.46s -> 12152.30s]  This one is not, but that one is.
[12152.86s -> 12153.74s]  Okay, they both now.
[12161.73s -> 12162.37s]  No, that's fine.
[12165.65s -> 12166.45s]  Folds over.
[12167.57s -> 12170.21s]  So they back up again.
[12170.21s -> 12171.33s]  And all this flipping making me dizzy.
[12171.33s -> 12172.61s]  Now roll the piece up from left
[12172.61s -> 12173.57s]  until it looks like this.
[12174.45s -> 12177.78s]  So that comes up and then that comes over.
[12179.31s -> 12180.91s]  And then the whole, that comes down.
[12188.50s -> 12189.00s]  Shit.
[12190.71s -> 12192.87s]  That, this, this way.
[12193.91s -> 12196.79s]  And then this tab comes down into there.
[12198.39s -> 12202.16s]  Oh, you little punk.
[12202.16s -> 12202.66s]  Come on.
[12210.13s -> 12212.80s]  Done.
[12212.80s -> 12215.28s]  Remember, the bits weren't supposed to fold.
[12215.28s -> 12216.16s]  Check that all four of them
[12216.16s -> 12217.36s]  are still nice and straight.
[12217.36s -> 12217.86s]  They are.
[12218.48s -> 12220.04s]  They are.
[12220.04s -> 12220.60s]  They are.
[12220.60s -> 12221.56s]  They are.
[12221.56s -> 12229.12s]  They are.
[12229.12s -> 12229.68s]  Yeah, that's right.
[12231.68s -> 12233.20s]  This one's a little fucked up.
[12233.20s -> 12236.05s]  No, that's fine.
[12237.41s -> 12237.91s]  Okay.
[12238.69s -> 12240.13s]  Uvey the steering column.
[12240.77s -> 12242.79s]  Next, we'll attach the steering wheel
[12242.79s -> 12243.43s]  to the steering column.
[12243.43s -> 12244.87s]  Make sure you've got the wheel close.
[12245.59s -> 12246.09s]  I do.
[12247.25s -> 12247.57s]  I do.
[12247.57s -> 12248.13s]  It's right here.
[12255.14s -> 12256.90s]  Fold the two colored flaps
[12256.90s -> 12258.58s]  in the middle of the steering wheel down
[12258.58s -> 12259.30s]  and out of the way.
[12259.94s -> 12262.12s]  We'll be inserting the steering wheel
[12262.12s -> 12262.84s]  column from above.
[12268.08s -> 12269.12s]  Here comes the column.
[12269.92s -> 12271.04s]  Straight down like this.
[12271.84s -> 12278.04s]  Before you insert the steering wheel column,
[12278.04s -> 12279.16s]  make sure it's facing the same way
[12279.16s -> 12279.88s]  as on the screen.
[12279.88s -> 12281.96s]  The printed bits on each side should match up.
[12282.60s -> 12283.99s]  Good deal.
[12283.99s -> 12285.65s]  All the way down.
[12286.37s -> 12302.02s]  We did it.
[12302.02s -> 12302.66s]  All right.
[12302.66s -> 12305.03s]  Steering wheel and steering column are done.
[12305.03s -> 12305.43s]  Beautiful.
[12305.43s -> 12305.83s]  It's done.
[12305.83s -> 12306.63s]  The steering wheel is done.
[12308.56s -> 12310.16s]  Now, fit these two parts together.
[12316.07s -> 12317.75s]  So, lift the steering wheel part up
[12317.75s -> 12318.79s]  and insert down to the base.
[12319.59s -> 12322.61s]  Well, it just sits down in there.
[12322.61s -> 12323.17s]  And that's it.
[12323.81s -> 12325.03s]  What have you done?
[12325.75s -> 12326.31s]  Okay.
[12326.31s -> 12329.57s]  So, just go down like that.
[12337.33s -> 12337.65s]  There.
[12338.21s -> 12339.17s]  That almost felt like winning
[12339.17s -> 12340.53s]  the crane game at an arcade.
[12340.53s -> 12341.97s]  Where's our stuffed animal prize?
[12345.04s -> 12346.40s]  Now, we're going to turn
[12346.40s -> 12347.52s]  the whole thing over.
[12348.48s -> 12350.85s]  The bits aren't all fixed together yet,
[12350.85s -> 12352.13s]  so hold everything carefully
[12352.13s -> 12353.01s]  to keep it in place.
[12356.07s -> 12357.03s]  Turn it upside down.
[12361.04s -> 12361.84s]  Here.
[12361.84s -> 12362.16s]  Okay.
[12365.03s -> 12367.59s]  This here piece is called Captain Crunch.
[12367.59s -> 12368.71s]  Captain Captain.
[12369.35s -> 12370.93s]  He caps the steering column,
[12370.93s -> 12373.97s]  then turns to keep it securely in place.
[12378.53s -> 12379.49s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[12387.73s -> 12387.97s]  All right.
[12387.97s -> 12388.69s]  Then that goes.
[12389.41s -> 12394.24s]  Spin the captain around
[12394.24s -> 12395.36s]  so that his two dents are facing
[12395.36s -> 12396.08s]  as shown on screen.
[12396.08s -> 12397.28s]  Then slide him down
[12397.28s -> 12398.48s]  on the end of the steering column.
[12399.84s -> 12401.20s]  So, like this.
[12402.00s -> 12415.08s]  Ahoy there, land lovers.
[12415.08s -> 12416.12s]  This is the captain speaking.
[12416.12s -> 12417.32s]  You'll want to hold...
[12417.40s -> 12418.28s]  Why is this Garfield?
[12419.08s -> 12420.37s]  Anybody feel like this is
[12420.37s -> 12421.33s]  like Garfield's bits?
[12422.60s -> 12423.64s]  I feel like we're hitting it
[12423.64s -> 12424.84s]  at Garfield's bits.
[12425.48s -> 12426.52s]  Ahoy there, land lovers.
[12426.52s -> 12427.72s]  This is the captain speaking.
[12427.72s -> 12429.40s]  You'll want to hold that wheel
[12429.40s -> 12431.64s]  nice and steady when you turn me around.
[12431.64s -> 12437.89s]  What do you want?
[12437.89s -> 12440.37s]  Around I go till the cross lines up.
[12441.09s -> 12450.52s]  Like this.
[12451.32s -> 12459.97s]  Like that.
[12460.53s -> 12464.55s]  That's it, right?
[12465.11s -> 12472.37s]  They don't call me captain for nothing.
[12472.37s -> 12473.33s]  You know, I wish I was part
[12473.33s -> 12474.45s]  of the Toy-Con submarine,
[12474.45s -> 12475.97s]  but a cardboard can dream.
[12475.97s -> 12476.45s]  This is...
[12476.45s -> 12477.49s]  Scarfield wrote all this.
[12478.29s -> 12479.01s]  I'm convinced.
[12485.30s -> 12487.30s]  Captain Capturn has four mates on deck.
[12487.30s -> 12490.10s]  They're called quadruple lock quadruplets.
[12490.10s -> 12491.70s]  They help keep the captain in his place.
[12492.66s -> 12494.42s]  So, flip them all around
[12494.42s -> 12495.30s]  and fold them all in half.
[12495.94s -> 12510.34s]  The one time Garfield's not here.
[12510.34s -> 12511.30s]  That's unfortunate.
[12511.94s -> 12513.36s]  Everybody loves Garfield.
[12514.08s -> 12515.76s]  All right, so stick them in half.
[12515.76s -> 12516.48s]  Flip them in there
[12516.48s -> 12517.44s]  and stick them in the slots.
[12518.24s -> 12527.17s]  First mate reporting for duty.
[12527.17s -> 12528.13s]  My siblings and I were destined
[12528.13s -> 12529.25s]  to do everything together.
[12529.25s -> 12530.21s]  Quadruplet power!
[12530.93s -> 12534.29s]  Slide the first mate down from above
[12534.29s -> 12535.17s]  and lock her in.
[12535.17s -> 12536.29s]  That's the first lock down.
[12537.09s -> 12550.10s]  That's it.
[12550.10s -> 12552.42s]  Do that to all four sides.
[12552.42s -> 12553.14s]  Right?
[12553.14s -> 12553.94s]  Yeah.
[12553.94s -> 12554.98s]  I'm not reading this.
[12556.34s -> 12557.14s]  Nice messages.
[12557.78s -> 12558.58s]  Uh, fourth mate.
[12558.58s -> 12559.62s]  They may spell, but they're together.
[12559.62s -> 12561.06s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12561.06s -> 12561.78s]  Okay.
[12561.78s -> 12569.65s]  Just that one.
[12569.65s -> 12575.80s]  Okay, one more.
[12580.48s -> 12581.92s]  So that is locked in.
[12582.64s -> 12585.96s]  You're missing out on labo lore?
[12585.96s -> 12588.12s]  Do you really care about labo lore?
[12588.12s -> 12589.00s]  You want me to go back?
[12589.80s -> 12590.82s]  I ain't going back.
[12591.76s -> 12594.80s]  Get ready to use these two stubby
[12594.80s -> 12595.68s]  T-shaped pieces.
[12595.68s -> 12596.96s]  They look a bit like sweaters.
[12597.68s -> 12598.40s]  I only have one.
[12598.96s -> 12600.93s]  Why do I only have one?
[12600.93s -> 12603.65s]  No, I don't.
[12603.65s -> 12603.89s]  Why?
[12604.45s -> 12605.14s]  All right.
[12605.14s -> 12606.10s]  Flip them up.
[12606.10s -> 12606.74s]  Spin them around.
[12607.38s -> 12619.14s]  Okay.
[12621.30s -> 12623.06s]  Uh, let's attach the first sweater.
[12623.06s -> 12624.18s]  Fold the arms so that they're ready
[12624.18s -> 12625.62s]  for a hug and then slide them into
[12625.62s -> 12626.90s]  the openings in the steering wheel.
[12627.78s -> 12634.23s]  That goes back around.
[12634.23s -> 12640.36s]  You fucking idiot.
[12640.36s -> 12640.92s]  All right.
[12640.92s -> 12641.32s]  Right there.
[12642.04s -> 12650.31s]  Like this.
[12651.03s -> 12651.35s]  Yes.
[12651.91s -> 12659.06s]  This is, you need like little hands
[12659.06s -> 12659.86s]  for this.
[12659.86s -> 12663.99s]  It's in.
[12666.88s -> 12667.36s]  Right?
[12667.36s -> 12667.84s]  Looks good.
[12668.48s -> 12676.16s]  Time for a second sweater.
[12676.16s -> 12676.96s]  It gives the steering wheel
[12676.96s -> 12677.92s]  a hug from the other side.
[12677.92s -> 12679.12s]  It's a steering wheel sandwich
[12679.12s -> 12680.16s]  on a sweater bread.
[12680.16s -> 12680.72s]  Garfield.
[12682.26s -> 12682.74s]  Excuse me?
[12683.78s -> 12684.66s]  Did you hear the dog?
[12685.22s -> 12685.94s]  I'll go get him.
[12686.74s -> 12692.55s]  I'm gonna go get my dog
[12693.27s -> 12694.31s]  because he's probably being
[12694.31s -> 12695.43s]  really annoying.
[12695.43s -> 12696.95s]  He's probably being super annoying.
[12697.91s -> 12700.53s]  Wait, how does this get in there?
[12712.68s -> 12713.72s]  Auto is never annoying.
[12713.72s -> 12714.36s]  No, I'm just kidding.
[12715.08s -> 12716.82s]  He's my special little boy.
[12717.54s -> 12718.18s]  So that's done.
[12718.90s -> 12721.46s]  It's in.
[12721.46s -> 12722.02s]  Secure.
[12722.98s -> 12723.86s]  The steering part is now
[12723.86s -> 12726.26s]  completely secured to the base.
[12726.26s -> 12727.14s]  Let's check to make sure
[12727.14s -> 12728.42s]  that everything moves like it should.
[12729.14s -> 12732.12s]  This is where the Toy-Con key comes in.
[12732.92s -> 12734.16s]  Oh, what do we have here?
[12734.16s -> 12734.72s]  There's a hole.
[12734.72s -> 12735.52s]  That's the perfect size
[12735.52s -> 12736.40s]  for the Toy-Con key
[12736.40s -> 12737.52s]  to slide right through.
[12741.19s -> 12743.19s]  I'm not gonna need the mode
[12743.19s -> 12743.83s]  in there right now.
[12744.39s -> 12756.60s]  So this goes like this.
[12762.40s -> 12762.72s]  Perfect.
[12763.97s -> 12764.53s]  Yes, it does.
[12765.33s -> 12769.36s]  Try spinning the steering wheel
[12769.36s -> 12769.76s]  around slowly.
[12769.76s -> 12770.64s]  Does it go all the way around
[12770.64s -> 12771.76s]  without stopping or catching?
[12779.28s -> 12779.84s]  Yes, it does.
[12780.48s -> 12786.07s]  Once you're done checking
[12786.07s -> 12786.87s]  the steering wheel,
[12787.59s -> 12790.21s]  remove the Toy-Con key for now.
[12790.21s -> 12791.73s]  It might get caught a bit the first time.
[12791.73s -> 12793.57s]  So make sure you remove it carefully.
[12793.57s -> 12794.05s]  I got it.
[12795.65s -> 12796.61s]  Somebody said other way.
[12797.49s -> 12799.19s]  Yeah, that's good.
[12799.91s -> 12800.82s]  It works.
[12801.46s -> 12803.51s]  All right, on to the next step.
[12803.51s -> 12805.03s]  The steering wheel base is finished.
[12805.03s -> 12806.15s]  The steering wheel is complete.
[12807.03s -> 12808.92s]  This would be a great time for a break.
[12809.48s -> 12810.52s]  They don't take breaks.
[12810.52s -> 12812.77s]  Here, three of seven.
[12812.77s -> 12814.21s]  Making the engine compartment.
[12819.16s -> 12820.60s]  I need to move this out of the way.
[12820.60s -> 12821.64s]  Don't take any more breaks.
[12821.64s -> 12822.44s]  Tell you this.
[12823.40s -> 12838.93s]  Auto, one second.
[12842.50s -> 12874.52s]  You have to be somewhere
[12874.52s -> 12875.64s]  that's not right in the way.
[12877.96s -> 12878.20s]  Okay.
[12879.08s -> 12882.61s]  See, he just want to be in here.
[12882.61s -> 12883.01s]  He's good.
[12884.36s -> 12886.36s]  He's currently like back there
[12886.36s -> 12887.08s]  where the door is.
[12887.88s -> 12892.21s]  All right, so we got this.
[12892.21s -> 12893.17s]  I have it already.
[12893.17s -> 12893.57s]  We're good.
[12894.53s -> 12897.51s]  Make sure you get the special parts.
[12898.31s -> 12899.48s]  All right, I'm going to eat.
[12901.48s -> 12905.25s]  I thought we were going to lie in the blanket.
[12905.25s -> 12906.13s]  What a good dog.
[12910.56s -> 12911.52s]  Huge piece.
[12911.52s -> 12912.40s]  Do I need the whole thing?
[12913.68s -> 12914.48s]  Almost the whole thing.
[12917.44s -> 12918.72s]  Jesus, this is huge.
[12919.76s -> 12922.95s]  This looks like somebody's rib cage.
[12923.91s -> 12925.67s]  It's like a Minecraft breastplate.
[12926.55s -> 12931.12s]  Should I wear this?
[12932.96s -> 12933.76s]  I'm going to need this later.
[12933.76s -> 12938.04s]  So, okay.
[12939.57s -> 12940.37s]  Show auto.
[12942.64s -> 12945.12s]  The cameras are like set in such specific.
[12945.84s -> 12947.28s]  Can you see him?
[12948.00s -> 12948.72s]  He's right there.
[12949.36s -> 12951.19s]  See, right here.
[12951.19s -> 12951.69s]  Auto.
[12952.23s -> 12953.59s]  Hello, Auto.
[12954.15s -> 12956.23s]  Hello, Mr. Auto.
[12961.03s -> 12961.91s]  There, he's right there.
[12962.87s -> 12964.88s]  All right, so let me take out
[12964.88s -> 12966.80s]  the little pieces that I need to punch out.
[12967.36s -> 12971.27s]  We'll continue on our vehicle quest.
[12972.15s -> 12973.96s]  I ripped it a little bit.
[12973.96s -> 12974.44s]  You know what?
[12975.16s -> 12975.64s]  Who cares?
[12976.20s -> 12979.04s]  Uh, that's it.
[12979.04s -> 12979.60s]  No, up here.
[12980.32s -> 12984.71s]  Pet him.
[12986.15s -> 12987.04s]  Where is he going?
[12996.24s -> 13000.53s]  He's under the blanket.
[13000.53s -> 13001.25s]  There's a little blade.
[13001.25s -> 13003.01s]  He just like stuffed his body underneath it.
[13003.81s -> 13007.20s]  Mr. Auto.
[13007.76s -> 13011.59s]  He's such a good dog.
[13012.07s -> 13013.35s]  He's the best dog ever.
[13013.35s -> 13015.51s]  All right, so let's do this.
[13015.67s -> 13016.23s]  Out of the way.
[13017.84s -> 13020.32s]  Uh, six, seven, eight, nine.
[13020.32s -> 13022.32s]  It's like 10 o'clock Eastern.
[13022.32s -> 13023.04s]  What day is it?
[13027.76s -> 13028.16s]  Saturday.
[13028.16s -> 13028.88s]  It's Saturday night.
[13029.68s -> 13030.24s]  We're good.
[13030.24s -> 13031.12s]  It's not even 10 o'clock.
[13032.63s -> 13036.23s]  All right, so get it out there.
[13036.87s -> 13038.39s]  The engine compartment comes from it.
[13039.11s -> 13039.84s]  What's wrong with me?
[13041.62s -> 13043.22s]  Okay, it doesn't really have an engine on it,
[13043.22s -> 13044.10s]  but it's fun to pretend.
[13048.02s -> 13048.42s]  Folds.
[13053.78s -> 13055.06s]  Pretty much all of them.
[13055.06s -> 13058.76s]  All the ones in the top.
[13058.76s -> 13059.56s]  All the ones in the middle.
[13060.44s -> 13061.56s]  Every single little piece.
[13061.56s -> 13062.52s]  All of it has to be folded.
[13066.02s -> 13066.82s]  Every single piece.
[13067.70s -> 13069.76s]  Okay, let's begin.
[13070.72s -> 13078.26s]  What kind of dog is Auto?
[13078.26s -> 13079.38s]  He's a Dachshund mix.
[13080.50s -> 13083.30s]  I don't know what he's mixed with,
[13084.48s -> 13086.56s]  but there's been plenty of guesses over the years.
[13087.60s -> 13090.08s]  Chihuahua, Beagle, Rottweiler,
[13090.08s -> 13091.20s]  Jack Russell Terrier.
[13092.08s -> 13093.44s]  Don't know because he's a rescue,
[13093.44s -> 13094.40s]  so I don't really know.
[13094.40s -> 13095.04s]  I have no idea.
[13096.16s -> 13097.12s]  There's been plenty of guesses.
[13101.19s -> 13102.15s]  He's a tiny boy.
[13102.79s -> 13104.23s]  He's actually kind of big
[13104.23s -> 13105.11s]  for a Dachshund,
[13105.75s -> 13110.31s]  but he is a very good dog.
[13110.87s -> 13115.33s]  It's an old classic German question.
[13116.74s -> 13117.78s]  What kind of dog do you have?
[13119.17s -> 13121.57s]  Yeah, I mean he's, I don't know.
[13121.57s -> 13123.57s]  Thought about doing one of those doggie DNA tests,
[13123.57s -> 13125.57s]  but I've read a lot of things
[13125.57s -> 13127.33s]  about how those things are bullshit
[13127.33s -> 13130.13s]  and they just send you back a random DNA test
[13130.13s -> 13131.33s]  that doesn't even mean anything.
[13131.97s -> 13133.09s]  I don't know how true that is.
[13137.41s -> 13137.97s]  Might be true.
[13137.97s -> 13138.61s]  It might not be.
[13144.77s -> 13145.65s]  Ooh, that felt good.
[13150.44s -> 13151.72s]  Do your own DNA test.
[13159.22s -> 13163.04s]  What?
[13163.04s -> 13164.40s]  12% ferret.
[13165.57s -> 13166.77s]  You might have some ferret in them.
[13172.39s -> 13174.55s]  Old, bold, right in the middle.
[13177.52s -> 13180.88s]  We got one, I think I see two here.
[13182.40s -> 13189.41s]  One, two, one, two.
[13192.28s -> 13194.28s]  Your dog is a purebred rat.
[13195.64s -> 13197.32s]  Well, then I'm sorry to tell you this,
[13197.32s -> 13198.60s]  but he's not a dog.
[13200.04s -> 13201.48s]  Your dog is a rat.
[13202.68s -> 13203.64s]  It's not a dog.
[13204.12s -> 13212.52s]  That's good.
[13212.68s -> 13220.60s]  Mess over here.
[13222.66s -> 13226.96s]  All right, so done, done.
[13227.68s -> 13228.48s]  One more piece.
[13228.48s -> 13231.52s]  So many little pieces in this big boy here.
[13237.44s -> 13238.64s]  Ever thought of getting a pet rat?
[13238.64s -> 13239.52s]  I have over the years.
[13240.32s -> 13242.37s]  My one issue with the pet rat is
[13243.81s -> 13244.53s]  they're wonderful,
[13244.53s -> 13245.41s]  they're really intelligent,
[13245.41s -> 13246.13s]  they're super sweet,
[13246.13s -> 13246.93s]  they're really fun,
[13246.93s -> 13247.65s]  they're really smart,
[13249.32s -> 13252.77s]  but man, they really only live like a year.
[13252.77s -> 13253.81s]  They live like two years.
[13255.01s -> 13257.01s]  I get so attached to any animal
[13257.01s -> 13257.73s]  that I ever have.
[13258.37s -> 13259.49s]  They used to have hamsters
[13259.49s -> 13260.85s]  and gerbils and all that shit,
[13260.85s -> 13263.81s]  and it was so tough after fucking a year.
[13267.86s -> 13268.98s]  A year and a half would go by,
[13268.98s -> 13269.70s]  and it was like right
[13269.70s -> 13271.30s]  when you're beginning to start a relationship
[13271.30s -> 13274.34s]  and like, oh, this is my animal, my pet.
[13275.06s -> 13275.94s]  It just sucks,
[13276.90s -> 13278.10s]  but they are really good pets.
[13278.10s -> 13279.46s]  They're really fun to be around.
[13279.46s -> 13281.22s]  They're really energetic.
[13281.22s -> 13281.94s]  They're really funny,
[13282.74s -> 13286.56s]  but just unfortunately they don't live very long.
[13287.84s -> 13290.39s]  Didn't get this piece.
[13292.32s -> 13293.12s]  So all the way up.
[13294.29s -> 13295.01s]  All the way up.
[13295.01s -> 13295.49s]  There we go.
[13299.03s -> 13300.47s]  So pull this in.
[13300.47s -> 13302.47s]  This big piece comes up and goes in here.
[13303.27s -> 13304.36s]  I can handle it.
[13305.08s -> 13332.36s]  God damn it,
[13332.36s -> 13334.68s]  he actually jebaited the labo stream.
[13337.14s -> 13338.18s]  Yes, I did.
[13338.18s -> 13338.82s]  I did.
[13338.82s -> 13340.50s]  You're right.
[13340.50s -> 13341.22s]  I did do that.
[13345.32s -> 13345.88s]  All right, we need,
[13348.31s -> 13349.83s]  it's time to introduce the eyelet.
[13349.83s -> 13350.79s]  It's got two parts.
[13350.79s -> 13352.07s]  The bit on the left is the grubbit
[13352.07s -> 13352.63s]  and the washer.
[13352.63s -> 13354.15s]  So how many of these do we have?
[13354.15s -> 13355.03s]  Do we need one or two?
[13355.03s -> 13355.67s]  How many do we need?
[13356.71s -> 13358.55s]  Take one of the gray eyelets from the bag.
[13368.79s -> 13369.35s]  Get over.
[13369.35s -> 13369.83s]  Get over.
[13369.83s -> 13370.31s]  Get over.
[13370.31s -> 13370.79s]  Get over.
[13370.79s -> 13371.19s]  Get over.
[13371.99s -> 13379.32s]  I don't want to take everything out.
[13379.32s -> 13381.16s]  Give me a grommet.
[13381.16s -> 13383.80s]  Give me a grommet.
[13383.80s -> 13385.68s]  Give me a grommet.
[13385.68s -> 13396.39s]  We forgot the crackers.
[13397.19s -> 13400.42s]  What do you mean?
[13400.42s -> 13401.14s]  What crackers?
[13401.70s -> 13403.48s]  What the heck do you mean, man?
[13404.12s -> 13405.25s]  What the fuck do you mean?
[13405.89s -> 13406.29s]  All right.
[13406.29s -> 13407.49s]  Oh, take the grommet
[13407.49s -> 13409.17s]  and push it into the hole from the outside.
[13410.21s -> 13412.77s]  So on the back of our easy bake oven,
[13412.77s -> 13413.49s]  this thing here.
[13414.05s -> 13415.25s]  So it goes through here.
[13416.13s -> 13428.45s]  So this snaps on through here.
[13429.09s -> 13430.55s]  Yes, it does.
[13431.75s -> 13432.79s]  That's the way it goes, right?
[13439.04s -> 13440.88s]  Snap the washer onto the grommet from the inside
[13440.88s -> 13441.76s]  and it'll make a snap.
[13442.96s -> 13446.48s]  Tell me if you hear it.
[13447.20s -> 13466.20s]  Nice.
[13466.20s -> 13466.60s]  Okay, good.
[13470.58s -> 13471.54s]  We need an adult.
[13472.18s -> 13475.30s]  What's the point of that?
[13475.30s -> 13487.76s]  Okay.
[13491.92s -> 13492.40s]  Sheet F.
[13493.28s -> 13503.67s]  Just as good as the first set.
[13511.81s -> 13513.25s]  All of it except for the bottom part.
[13514.05s -> 13515.84s]  You guys having a good time?
[13515.84s -> 13516.40s]  You having fun?
[13517.68s -> 13520.21s]  You guys having fun?
[13520.21s -> 13529.56s]  I'm seeing some nose here.
[13530.12s -> 13533.62s]  I'm seeing some nose here.
[13533.62s -> 13535.38s]  I'm gonna have to eat paint on stream.
[13535.38s -> 13535.94s]  You know what I mean?
[13535.94s -> 13536.90s]  Like I'm seeing some nose.
[13537.86s -> 13544.79s]  What do I do with this?
[13544.79s -> 13547.27s]  What do I do with my fucking airline puke box?
[13547.99s -> 13551.41s]  I'm running out of space.
[13552.13s -> 13555.99s]  Don't turn this piece.
[13555.99s -> 13557.35s]  Don't, don't, don't, don't do it.
[13558.07s -> 13561.68s]  Fold these flops first.
[13562.40s -> 13574.40s]  Go say hello to italics.
[13574.40s -> 13576.47s]  Just tell me if you can hear this on his stream.
[13612.40s -> 13617.75s]  Did you hear me?
[13624.00s -> 13625.60s]  He has like the sweetest face right now.
[13625.60s -> 13626.32s]  I have to show him.
[13640.93s -> 13641.97s]  You see here or no you can't?
[13642.61s -> 13648.93s]  Move camera.
[13648.93s -> 13650.13s]  I can't move the camera.
[13650.13s -> 13651.81s]  It's like in the worst possible one.
[13651.81s -> 13652.45s]  Maybe I can.
[13656.88s -> 13667.46s]  Hey, what are you doing?
[13676.12s -> 13677.00s]  He's so cute.
[13685.76s -> 13687.04s]  He's my special boy.
[13690.58s -> 13691.78s]  You guys couldn't hear me?
[13691.78s -> 13693.14s]  I made like a bird noise.
[13693.14s -> 13693.62s]  Oh well.
[13693.62s -> 13695.86s]  I mean that means that we have good sound dampening.
[13695.86s -> 13696.26s]  That's good.
[13697.14s -> 13705.52s]  Is this in a good spot?
[13706.16s -> 13713.16s]  I hear is good right there.
[13713.16s -> 13713.72s]  That's all right.
[13717.12s -> 13720.28s]  We might have heard you.
[13720.28s -> 13721.24s]  We thought it was auto.
[13721.24s -> 13728.00s]  No, I went like pretty loud out there.
[13728.64s -> 13731.80s]  You're supposed to watch italics's stream
[13731.80s -> 13732.68s]  and see if you heard it.
[13733.24s -> 13737.36s]  All right.
[13737.36s -> 13738.88s]  So wait, don't fold these yet.
[13738.88s -> 13739.52s]  Fold them back.
[13751.88s -> 13754.20s]  Now the fact when you're freezing the big fold,
[13754.20s -> 13756.92s]  be careful not to fold this little mushroomy part.
[13758.28s -> 13759.49s]  All right.
[13760.37s -> 13762.21s]  Don't fold the mushroomy part.
[13776.16s -> 13783.19s]  Fold it all up.
[13787.76s -> 13789.68s]  Left, right, up, down.
[13789.68s -> 13790.40s]  Fold it in here.
[13794.96s -> 13795.84s]  Thumbs up.
[13796.16s -> 13796.96s]  Careful.
[13796.96s -> 13801.67s]  It's a weird swing that that does all the way across.
[13802.47s -> 13805.99s]  And that folds up and then goes into the little tab
[13805.99s -> 13806.71s]  that's down there.
[13806.71s -> 13807.51s]  Do you see it?
[13807.51s -> 13808.47s]  Do you see it, folks?
[13813.51s -> 13813.83s]  That?
[13816.39s -> 13817.19s]  No, I don't.
[13817.83s -> 13822.47s]  Something on this side.
[13823.27s -> 13832.58s]  Back up with a little mushroom.
[13833.30s -> 13838.63s]  I did such a good job.
[13839.27s -> 13854.04s]  Okay.
[13854.76s -> 13856.12s]  Now turn the whole piece to its front
[13856.12s -> 13857.96s]  and check to make sure that the ends of both tabs
[13857.96s -> 13859.00s]  are sticking to the other side.
[13859.96s -> 13861.78s]  They are.
[13861.78s -> 13862.34s]  They are.
[13863.06s -> 13863.54s]  Okay.
[13863.54s -> 13864.02s]  They are.
[13864.58s -> 13868.69s]  Although this one's a little torn.
[13868.69s -> 13869.65s]  No, they are.
[13869.65s -> 13870.71s]  Looks fine.
[13871.43s -> 13875.62s]  Congratulatory wine chug.
[13877.40s -> 13878.12s]  I agree to that.
[13891.80s -> 13892.52s]  That piece is done for now.
[13892.52s -> 13893.24s]  We'll eat it again soon.
[13893.24s -> 13893.80s]  What soon?
[13894.36s -> 13895.08s]  Isn't soon enough.
[13895.81s -> 13896.37s]  Be patient.
[13907.60s -> 13908.32s]  Oh, this piece.
[13909.83s -> 13911.35s]  That was the weakest chug in the world.
[13914.20s -> 13914.52s]  Okay.
[13932.88s -> 13933.84s]  I can't spit this out.
[13938.16s -> 13938.40s]  Okay.
[13951.01s -> 13953.08s]  Never mind.
[13966.23s -> 13966.87s]  Hey, great job.
[13976.48s -> 13977.52s]  It's a new emo.
[13990.10s -> 13992.55s]  Now, do I fold those?
[13992.55s -> 13993.03s]  I don't know.
[13993.03s -> 13995.09s]  I didn't let the video game tell me.
[13995.09s -> 13995.89s]  Watch out.
[13995.89s -> 13999.20s]  This piece has a bit in the middle
[13999.20s -> 14000.32s]  that you definitely shouldn't fold.
[14000.32s -> 14001.04s]  Try to keep that in mind
[14001.04s -> 14002.08s]  when you're folding the other bits.
[14002.72s -> 14006.32s]  I won't.
[14006.32s -> 14011.49s]  All right.
[14011.49s -> 14013.01s]  Fold this like that.
[14013.01s -> 14015.09s]  Looks good.
[14016.76s -> 14018.04s]  Armpit sweat.
[14018.04s -> 14027.91s]  Give me a break.
[14027.91s -> 14030.77s]  It's been four hours.
[14030.77s -> 14031.57s]  It's four hours.
[14031.57s -> 14038.21s]  But drinking wine, it could be much worse.
[14038.85s -> 14039.57s]  Let me tell you.
[14040.13s -> 14043.64s]  I'm fine.
[14043.64s -> 14045.00s]  It's just perspiration.
[14045.00s -> 14046.52s]  I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt.
[14046.52s -> 14048.04s]  I'm in Las Vegas.
[14048.12s -> 14049.48s]  You know how hot it is here?
[14049.48s -> 14051.08s]  It's like 42 degrees out right now.
[14051.08s -> 14051.96s]  It gets cold in the winter.
[14052.85s -> 14053.17s]  All right.
[14053.17s -> 14054.53s]  Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it,
[14054.53s -> 14055.49s]  fold it, fold it, fold it.
[14065.75s -> 14066.95s]  It's fucking cold out right now.
[14067.83s -> 14069.43s]  Vegas is fucking chilly.
[14070.66s -> 14073.06s]  As like the kids say, as fuck.
[14073.06s -> 14073.54s]  You know what I mean?
[14074.18s -> 14080.53s]  Do I fold this?
[14080.53s -> 14081.41s]  Hold on.
[14081.41s -> 14092.32s]  Oh, I got to...
[14093.36s -> 14094.48s]  Chugging wine is like...
[14095.97s -> 14097.81s]  Nobody did that besides Bacchus.
[14100.10s -> 14102.58s]  Nobody chugs wine except for Bacchus.
[14102.58s -> 14104.34s]  It's the only person in history to ever do it.
[14106.84s -> 14107.48s]  All right.
[14107.48s -> 14109.32s]  Do I fold this one down?
[14109.96s -> 14115.88s]  I don't think I fold that one.
[14115.88s -> 14117.40s]  I don't think I did the top one down.
[14118.12s -> 14125.38s]  So this goes...
[14125.38s -> 14125.94s]  Oh, man.
[14143.36s -> 14144.80s]  That's a hard blink.
[14146.48s -> 14147.60s]  Why don't you do webcam?
[14148.40s -> 14151.59s]  Why don't you do webcam?
[14151.59s -> 14152.95s]  How come you never do face cam?
[14153.51s -> 14155.22s]  That was a hard blink.
[14168.64s -> 14169.36s]  Soft blink is...
[14169.36s -> 14170.72s]  A hard blink is like...
[14170.72s -> 14171.76s]  I'm lost.
[14174.71s -> 14181.78s]  I didn't do it.
[14181.78s -> 14182.34s]  It's fine.
[14182.98s -> 14187.28s]  What if I faint on stream?
[14187.28s -> 14187.84s]  I'm not gonna...
[14187.84s -> 14189.12s]  Why would I faint on stream?
[14189.76s -> 14194.02s]  Did I miss a tab?
[14198.44s -> 14199.24s]  No, that's correct.
[14199.24s -> 14199.48s]  Right?
[14199.48s -> 14199.88s]  I got it.
[14201.67s -> 14203.91s]  We'll insert it into the part we finished just before this one.
[14203.91s -> 14205.99s]  Fold the flap at the bottom of the long gap here.
[14205.99s -> 14207.43s]  Down and out of the way.
[14208.23s -> 14211.51s]  What does it want me to do?
[14211.51s -> 14213.03s]  Fold the gap out of the way.
[14213.03s -> 14213.35s]  You said...
[14213.35s -> 14214.07s]  You just said it.
[14214.07s -> 14214.31s]  What is...
[14214.31s -> 14214.71s]  Where is it?
[14215.67s -> 14222.92s]  That goes down.
[14223.56s -> 14225.11s]  Look every at the screen.
[14225.11s -> 14226.79s]  Make sure that the part is facing the right direction.
[14226.79s -> 14227.99s]  Then insert as far as it will go.
[14228.55s -> 14235.70s]  It kind of goes in like this first.
[14235.70s -> 14237.62s]  It's like a D battery.
[14238.66s -> 14243.25s]  I didn't even fucking need the tutorial.
[14246.39s -> 14246.79s]  That's fine.
[14246.79s -> 14247.11s]  That works.
[14247.75s -> 14251.76s]  Now the sun stand will probably stand the piece up.
[14251.76s -> 14254.40s]  Hey, it doesn't look a bit like a koala's face.
[14255.36s -> 14264.16s]  I mean, it does.
[14268.66s -> 14269.30s]  Okay.
[14269.30s -> 14270.98s]  Is the piece facing the same way as on screen?
[14270.98s -> 14273.06s]  It'll be tricky to fix later if you get it wrong.
[14273.06s -> 14273.70s]  Double check.
[14274.34s -> 14285.36s]  I got it, right?
[14285.36s -> 14286.00s]  Yeah.
[14286.00s -> 14291.30s]  Everything looks good.
[14291.30s -> 14293.06s]  Let's lock it securely in the place of this piece here.
[14293.06s -> 14294.74s]  A long lost cousin of the quadruple.
[14294.74s -> 14296.18s]  I don't want to hear the fucking whole thing.
[14296.98s -> 14298.02s]  Turn it over and fold it in two.
[14298.02s -> 14299.30s]  Now it's ready to be locked.
[14299.30s -> 14300.02s]  Lock, lock, lock.
[14300.02s -> 14300.74s]  Lock, lock it.
[14300.74s -> 14301.46s]  Here's a lock.
[14301.46s -> 14302.18s]  Lock the thing.
[14302.18s -> 14302.74s]  Okay, great.
[14303.70s -> 14306.47s]  How did I chug that fucking line?
[14306.47s -> 14307.43s]  I was just going slow.
[14308.55s -> 14316.12s]  Shit.
[14316.12s -> 14321.60s]  I did it.
[14321.60s -> 14322.00s]  I think.
[14322.72s -> 14326.61s]  Hold on.
[14326.61s -> 14328.69s]  I gave it a BRB for one second.
[14391.51s -> 14391.83s]  Shit.
[14401.92s -> 14404.40s]  That was deer in headlights.
[14404.40s -> 14406.16s]  I fucking hate face cams.
[14406.16s -> 14412.77s]  I wasn't ready for it and I pressed it.
[14412.77s -> 14422.63s]  I get embarrassed real easily.
[14422.63s -> 14423.17s]  All right.
[14423.17s -> 14423.97s]  Here we go.
[14423.97s -> 14435.14s]  All right.
[14435.14s -> 14435.62s]  Here, look.
[14435.62s -> 14436.74s]  It's a koala.
[14436.74s -> 14437.62s]  Right, Nintendo?
[14439.73s -> 14441.30s]  Ta-da.
[14441.30s -> 14442.26s]  It's all done.
[14442.26s -> 14442.74s]  I did it.
[14442.74s -> 14444.10s]  I finished the whole thing on stream.
[14444.10s -> 14444.74s]  It's over.
[14444.74s -> 14455.38s]  Where's that?
[14455.46s -> 14455.94s]  All right.
[14455.94s -> 14456.66s]  Get in there.
[14457.46s -> 14460.04s]  Stop it.
[14460.04s -> 14464.95s]  Okay.
[14464.95s -> 14468.42s]  So here we go.
[14468.42s -> 14473.75s]  Fold it up and get it in there like this.
[14474.63s -> 14479.36s]  Why is that off?
[14479.36s -> 14480.24s]  Why is this turned off?
[14496.08s -> 14523.76s]  Battery's dead.
[14523.76s -> 14524.96s]  Don't throw your phone behind me.
[14525.97s -> 14526.45s]  Okay.
[14526.45s -> 14527.09s]  What are we doing?
[14527.09s -> 14527.65s]  Here.
[14527.65s -> 14531.46s]  I was, it was, it was fucking dark in here.
[14531.46s -> 14532.02s]  I was like, what the hell?
[14533.09s -> 14533.89s]  I was like, what the hell?
[14534.53s -> 14536.82s]  Okay, so that matches up with here.
[14537.38s -> 14538.76s]  So you guys can see.
[14542.63s -> 14543.43s]  See what I'm talking about?
[14543.99s -> 14553.81s]  All right.
[14553.81s -> 14556.13s]  So the tabs need to, this comes down.
[14562.32s -> 14562.88s]  Whoa.
[14562.88s -> 14565.20s]  That, I get the other one quick.
[14565.20s -> 14565.76s]  Was it right?
[14565.76s -> 14566.24s]  Is that correct?
[14566.24s -> 14566.96s]  I hope it's correct.
[14567.76s -> 14568.08s]  It is.
[14571.30s -> 14572.34s]  The engine is complete.
[14578.92s -> 14579.64s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[14580.84s -> 14604.63s]  What'd I tell you?
[14636.72s -> 14638.56s]  I got stains under my armpit.
[14638.56s -> 14640.00s]  Look at how good I look right now.
[14640.00s -> 14641.04s]  I look fresh.
[14641.04s -> 14642.16s]  I look well rested.
[14642.80s -> 14643.52s]  Fast forward.
[14644.56s -> 14645.84s]  Seven and a half hours from now.
[14645.84s -> 14647.04s]  I bet you my hair's greasy.
[14647.04s -> 14648.32s]  My face is watery.
[14648.32s -> 14650.56s]  And like I got stains under my armpit.
[14650.56s -> 14652.08s]  Look at how good I look right now.
[14652.08s -> 14653.12s]  I look fresh.
[14653.12s -> 14654.24s]  I look well rested.
[14654.88s -> 14655.60s]  Fast forward.
[14656.64s -> 14657.92s]  Seven and a half hours from now.
[14657.92s -> 14659.12s]  I bet you my hair's greasy.
[14659.12s -> 14660.40s]  My face is watery.
[14660.40s -> 14662.72s]  And like I got stains under my armpit.
[14662.72s -> 14664.16s]  Look at how good I look right now.
[14664.16s -> 14665.20s]  I look fresh.
[14665.20s -> 14666.96s]  I look well rested.
[14666.96s -> 14667.68s]  Fast forward.
[14668.72s -> 14670.00s]  Seven and a half hours from now.
[14670.00s -> 14671.20s]  I bet you my hair's greasy.
[14671.20s -> 14672.48s]  My face is watery.
[14672.48s -> 14674.72s]  And like I got stains under my armpit.
[14674.72s -> 14676.24s]  Look at how good I look right now.
[14676.24s -> 14677.28s]  I look fresh.
[14677.28s -> 14679.04s]  I look well rested.
[14679.04s -> 14679.76s]  Fast forward.
[14689.52s -> 14690.24s]  Fuck that guy.
[14690.96s -> 14691.76s]  He doesn't know shit.
[14701.54s -> 14702.42s]  Oh, I lost it.
[14702.42s -> 14703.94s]  Wait, where did it go?
[14703.94s -> 14704.58s]  Where did it go?
[14704.58s -> 14705.06s]  It's gone.
[14707.24s -> 14707.56s]  I don't know.
[14707.56s -> 14708.68s]  I can't get it back.
[14708.68s -> 14709.96s]  Where's the other cam?
[14709.96s -> 14711.48s]  Where did the other camera go?
[14716.79s -> 14717.91s]  I actually fucking lost it.
[14725.86s -> 14740.84s]  Hey, hey.
[14741.94s -> 14743.30s]  Let me tell you guys something.
[14743.30s -> 14744.58s]  Fast forward right now.
[14745.46s -> 14747.22s]  Three or four hours from now.
[14747.22s -> 14749.70s]  I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.
[14749.70s -> 14751.06s]  My face is going to be greasy.
[14751.06s -> 14752.82s]  I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.
[14752.82s -> 14754.58s]  I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.
[14754.58s -> 14756.58s]  Water's going to be pouring down my shirt.
[14756.58s -> 14757.78s]  It's going to look really bad.
[14757.78s -> 14758.82s]  Just remember this.
[14758.82s -> 14760.34s]  Like three or four hours from now, okay?
[14762.02s -> 14762.66s]  Remember this.
[14784.87s -> 14786.47s]  Making the levers and lever holders.
[14786.47s -> 14787.43s]  That's my favorite part.
[14788.15s -> 14790.21s]  Get down there.
[14790.21s -> 14792.04s]  All right, forward.
[14792.04s -> 14793.00s]  I said we're almost done.
[14793.72s -> 14807.48s]  Okay, levers and holders.
[14809.33s -> 14810.18s]  D and G.
[14811.30s -> 14821.84s]  Okay, I'd eat D.
[14824.50s -> 14827.60s]  Last part from D.
[14827.60s -> 14828.72s]  This is D, right?
[14828.72s -> 14829.84s]  Oh, shit.
[14830.48s -> 14840.77s]  This one's F.
[14845.38s -> 14850.47s]  D, you got it.
[14850.47s -> 14853.03s]  Okay, D and then all that shit up there.
[14853.59s -> 14854.39s]  I don't know what that's for,
[14854.39s -> 14855.27s]  but it's for something later.
[14856.15s -> 14866.72s]  Watch out.
[14873.62s -> 14876.42s]  Oh, you know, you just want to like stuff your face
[14876.42s -> 14879.70s]  and your dog's body and just smell his dog's smell.
[14880.74s -> 14882.26s]  I want to do that so bad right now.
[14892.05s -> 14893.65s]  People writing question marks right now.
[14894.69s -> 14895.57s]  Excuse me.
[14895.57s -> 14896.13s]  Give me a break.
[14901.78s -> 14903.30s]  The savory dog smell.
[14904.02s -> 14905.38s]  Am I fucking out of my mind?
[14905.38s -> 14906.10s]  What are you talking about?
[14913.33s -> 14914.93s]  You guys know what I'm talking about.
[14914.93s -> 14916.77s]  Do I really need to talk about that?
[14916.77s -> 14917.57s]  What are you talking about?
[14925.43s -> 14928.07s]  I don't understand the people that are writing question marks here.
[14928.07s -> 14929.03s]  I really don't understand it.
[14929.59s -> 14936.10s]  Oh, I'm seeing 50-50 here.
[14936.74s -> 14937.78s]  You're a psycho.
[14937.78s -> 14938.02s]  What?
[14940.10s -> 14943.46s]  It's the dog, like the Frito's dog smell.
[14943.46s -> 14944.42s]  What are you talking about?
[14945.70s -> 14950.37s]  You guys not have a dog?
[14951.01s -> 14961.14s]  I'm being fucking annihilated right now in chat.
[14961.14s -> 14961.54s]  For what?
[14962.18s -> 14970.24s]  I can't believe it.
[14970.88s -> 14971.84s]  I can't believe it.
[14972.95s -> 14974.87s]  I'm being annihilated in my own chat.
[14976.45s -> 14977.57s]  Chat, I'm being annihilated.
[14977.57s -> 14979.41s]  Why am I, like I'm in an opera?
[14979.41s -> 14980.05s]  All right, let's go.
[14981.81s -> 14982.85s]  I'm surprised.
[14983.57s -> 14992.88s]  The levers of the secret sauce for the McDonald's number one
[14992.88s -> 14995.36s]  is the best item of any menu on any menu.
[14996.00s -> 14997.04s]  You find it in the play section.
[14997.04s -> 14998.32s]  Whatever, fuck off.
[14998.32s -> 14998.96s]  All right, let's go.
[15000.08s -> 15002.12s]  Oh, fold the lines with both hands.
[15002.12s -> 15004.12s]  It'll make sure that the McDonald's number one
[15004.12s -> 15005.40s]  Big Mac is the best menu item.
[15006.28s -> 15015.73s]  Okay, like that.
[15019.11s -> 15021.19s]  Savoring dog sauce.
[15023.06s -> 15023.54s]  What was this?
[15024.18s -> 15024.58s]  I don't know.
[15025.38s -> 15040.12s]  Okay, don't fold this part.
[15043.08s -> 15043.72s]  Take the pole.
[15044.68s -> 15045.00s]  Okay.
[15049.80s -> 15050.84s]  Dog smell.
[15050.84s -> 15052.04s]  Yes, shove your face in it.
[15052.04s -> 15052.76s]  No, you're drunk.
[15054.68s -> 15055.80s]  Yes, shove your face in it.
[15056.74s -> 15059.67s]  And by the way, I mean,
[15059.67s -> 15061.75s]  when you get bailed out from your own community,
[15062.79s -> 15064.39s]  60% of the vote.
[15064.39s -> 15065.51s]  Yes, shove your face in it.
[15072.47s -> 15073.03s]  60%.
[15074.31s -> 15080.76s]  You still don't understand.
[15085.38s -> 15088.58s]  61% now agrees.
[15090.00s -> 15092.32s]  39%, that's not even like,
[15092.96s -> 15098.92s]  that's a vocal minority.
[15098.92s -> 15101.24s]  No, that is a voting majority.
[15101.96s -> 15104.20s]  I'm sorry, but that's a majority.
[15104.84s -> 15106.26s]  Don't even need to look at it anymore.
[15106.26s -> 15108.77s]  I voted.
[15108.77s -> 15109.33s]  I voted.
[15109.33s -> 15118.47s]  What am I making now?
[15121.94s -> 15123.36s]  Two guys going like this.
[15124.16s -> 15131.25s]  Dog breath is gross.
[15131.25s -> 15132.45s]  It's not dog breath.
[15132.45s -> 15135.09s]  It's the savory sleepy dog smell.
[15135.09s -> 15135.59s]  What?
[15136.47s -> 15137.91s]  How do you not know what this is?
[15139.59s -> 15142.15s]  If you have a dog and the dog is sleeping
[15142.79s -> 15145.92s]  and you walk over to your dog that is asleep
[15146.56s -> 15148.16s]  and you pet the dog's back
[15148.16s -> 15149.60s]  and the dog wakes up for a second.
[15150.16s -> 15152.24s]  Whoa, savory, sleepy dog smell.
[15154.79s -> 15157.51s]  I don't understand how you don't get that.
[15159.40s -> 15161.08s]  No idea what I'm talking about.
[15161.08s -> 15161.88s]  No idea.
[15161.88s -> 15163.96s]  People have no idea what I mean by this.
[15168.28s -> 15170.28s]  I don't, I don't, how is this possible?
[15170.84s -> 15183.30s]  I don't, I don't get it.
[15191.35s -> 15191.83s]  You're weird.
[15191.83s -> 15192.79s]  I'm not weird.
[15192.79s -> 15193.75s]  What the fuck?
[15193.75s -> 15194.47s]  This is real.
[15198.42s -> 15200.42s]  You're making this up for views.
[15201.14s -> 15205.17s]  I don't do that shit.
[15205.89s -> 15214.45s]  I feel like I'm being attacked.
[15226.15s -> 15229.75s]  Dog sniffer own facts and logic.
[15230.55s -> 15231.05s]  Okay.
[15231.75s -> 15233.08s]  Believe me.
[15233.08s -> 15233.56s]  Here we go.
[15243.43s -> 15244.87s]  I thought everybody knew what that was.
[15245.75s -> 15248.10s]  I thought I was going to be like,
[15248.10s -> 15249.14s]  oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
[15249.14s -> 15250.82s]  but I'm like the weirdo apparently.
[15251.46s -> 15252.90s]  Kim talks about this shit too.
[15260.47s -> 15262.63s]  I want to take this to the fucking supreme court.
[15263.43s -> 15268.60s]  Does the dog smelly dog sleepy smell exist?
[15270.98s -> 15271.86s]  I don't know.
[15271.86s -> 15272.50s]  I'm not sure.
[15273.30s -> 15283.03s]  This is not going to even leave your district.
[15283.03s -> 15283.91s]  Oh, okay.
[15285.41s -> 15286.29s]  See you in court.
[15288.42s -> 15290.10s]  Guy that won't show up.
[15290.10s -> 15293.22s]  That's some kind of fucking currency thing.
[15295.72s -> 15296.76s]  Is my hair purple?
[15297.40s -> 15300.93s]  My hair is like a dirty blonde.
[15300.93s -> 15301.43s]  Brown.
[15306.08s -> 15308.16s]  I don't smell my dog like a lunatic.
[15319.88s -> 15321.64s]  Reddit slash dog lovers.
[15325.51s -> 15327.51s]  Reddit slash pet owners.
[15328.82s -> 15330.34s]  Reddit slash pet owners.
[15356.08s -> 15375.16s]  Thank you dad hunter for the $20.
[15376.64s -> 15377.52s]  Hydrate.
[15377.52s -> 15378.98s]  I did downstairs.
[15378.98s -> 15379.54s]  Don't worry.
[15379.54s -> 15387.89s]  Don't make me fucking get in it.
[15387.89s -> 15389.25s]  Don't make me get a variable in here.
[15389.81s -> 15391.28s]  I'll go get him.
[15391.92s -> 15395.40s]  I'm gonna go stop his stream to bring him in here.
[15397.01s -> 15398.53s]  I'll say your stream is over right now.
[15398.53s -> 15399.97s]  You're coming in here and fucking talking.
[15400.61s -> 15405.28s]  We'll get to the bottom of this real quick.
[15406.00s -> 15412.37s]  Is he still streaming?
[15443.12s -> 15443.84s]  Lock your door.
[15444.40s -> 15444.98s]  Don't worry.
[15444.98s -> 15445.70s]  Minus will bark.
[15445.70s -> 15446.82s]  He'll let me know what's going on.
[15451.67s -> 15452.55s]  Lock your door.
[15454.50s -> 15456.82s]  There's no locks on the doors in this house.
[15462.66s -> 15463.38s]  Excuse me.
[15463.38s -> 15465.12s]  Excuse me, doctor.
[15529.32s -> 15530.04s]  God damn.
[15546.52s -> 15549.40s]  Dogs have a savory, sleepy smell.
[15549.40s -> 15572.29s]  I'll call her.
[15572.29s -> 15573.17s]  I'll call her.
[15573.17s -> 15574.34s]  Call her right now.
[15574.34s -> 15575.38s]  No, she's working.
[15575.38s -> 15579.27s]  That's not smart.
[15579.27s -> 15579.91s]  I'm stuck.
[15590.64s -> 15591.76s]  Dogs have a savory.
[15591.76s -> 15594.44s]  Ah, he can't hear me.
[15594.44s -> 15595.16s]  Okay, hey.
[15595.16s -> 15599.06s]  So, uh, Nintendo Switch.
[15599.06s -> 15622.92s]  Okay, so folding lines and it's real.
[15622.92s -> 15623.64s]  Somebody get it.
[15624.82s -> 15625.30s]  What's a poll?
[15625.30s -> 15625.94s]  Where's that poll?
[15625.94s -> 15627.14s]  Somebody link the poll right now.
[15627.78s -> 15631.67s]  Critical has a dog?
[15632.74s -> 15633.62s]  He fucking gets it.
[15634.26s -> 15634.90s]  Guaranteed.
[15634.90s -> 15636.34s]  I guarantee he gets it.
[15637.60s -> 15639.36s]  Ask Critical next time he streams.
[15639.36s -> 15641.60s]  Does a dog have a savory, sleepy smell?
[15641.60s -> 15644.16s]  Like the savory dog smell?
[15644.16s -> 15645.54s]  He'll fucking get it.
[15645.54s -> 15646.18s]  I know he will.
[15654.60s -> 15655.72s]  I don't have his phone number.
[15656.52s -> 15657.08s]  Call him.
[15657.08s -> 15657.32s]  Call.
[15657.32s -> 15658.92s]  I don't have his fucking telephone number.
[15659.48s -> 15660.60s]  Is Jermuff weird?
[15662.37s -> 15663.73s]  This is two votes.
[15665.33s -> 15674.96s]  We're gonna read it.
[15674.96s -> 15675.44s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[15675.44s -> 15676.48s]  We got a Reddit thread here.
[15679.96s -> 15681.24s]  Is it weird to smell your dog?
[15681.24s -> 15682.68s]  I made a poll and got some responses.
[15683.32s -> 15685.00s]  Spelling the dog full face style.
[15685.00s -> 15685.80s]  What are your opinions?
[15687.43s -> 15688.55s]  Okay, let's see what Reddit says.
[15689.49s -> 15691.17s]  Is this some kind of currency?
[15691.17s -> 15693.09s]  I like dogs sniff the savory dog.
[15693.99s -> 15694.55s]  That helps.
[15696.15s -> 15697.03s]  That helps a lot.
[15697.03s -> 15697.99s]  Look, fresh.
[15697.99s -> 15699.11s]  I look well rested.
[15700.55s -> 15701.67s]  Wrong, wrong thing.
[15707.30s -> 15708.18s]  Call Critical.
[15708.18s -> 15710.98s]  I don't have his telephone identification number.
[15713.14s -> 15714.58s]  How did my dog get outside?
[15719.11s -> 15728.61s]  He's like, hey, let me in.
[15756.66s -> 15757.38s]  I got it.
[15757.38s -> 15758.26s]  I got it.
[15758.26s -> 15763.44s]  I know I'm right.
[15767.43s -> 15770.07s]  We ask who's streaming now.
[15773.76s -> 15778.68s]  Okay, looks good.
[15782.60s -> 15784.36s]  Pull the flap down like this.
[15788.39s -> 15789.11s]  I can't go in.
[15791.08s -> 15792.20s]  First lever is done.
[15800.88s -> 15801.76s]  Ask Discord.
[15801.76s -> 15805.44s]  I know, I know what I know, okay?
[15818.05s -> 15819.49s]  Ask UberHackZeroNova.
[15821.70s -> 15822.50s]  He would know too.
[15823.30s -> 15842.12s]  I'm not sniffing my dog's ass.
[15842.76s -> 15844.88s]  I'm not sniffing my dog's ass.
[15845.84s -> 15862.80s]  Okay, first of all, I just did the Adam Sandler gibberish thing from Billy Madison.
[15863.36s -> 15868.69s]  I'm sorry.
[15869.41s -> 15874.92s]  Critical said you're sick.
[15875.64s -> 15876.88s]  Get him in here.
[15876.88s -> 15877.52s]  Get him in here.
[15877.52s -> 15878.00s]  Get him in here.
[15878.00s -> 15878.48s]  Where is he?
[15879.04s -> 15880.26s]  Where is he?
[15880.26s -> 15880.58s]  Right now.
[15880.58s -> 15881.86s]  I'll talk to him right now.
[15881.86s -> 15882.74s]  I'll talk to him right now.
[15883.38s -> 15885.09s]  I'll talk to him right now.
[15885.73s -> 15886.29s]  Where is he?
[15886.85s -> 15888.16s]  This is a PlayStation.
[15888.16s -> 15889.52s]  That's PlayStation.
[15889.52s -> 15892.55s]  What did I draw?
[15892.55s -> 15892.87s]  Get it?
[15892.87s -> 15893.35s]  Where is he?
[15894.15s -> 15895.43s]  Oh, don't hit the escape button.
[15895.43s -> 15901.44s]  Don't stop streaming.
[15901.44s -> 15903.36s]  Critical said smell my asshole.
[15906.04s -> 15906.60s]  Really?
[15906.60s -> 15941.30s]  This fucking Reese's commercial.
[15941.30s -> 15952.42s]  He's playing RuneScape right now.
[15952.42s -> 15955.96s]  Try this in Tob.
[15967.00s -> 15969.00s]  Let's check out this fucking Twisted Bone, Tob.
[15969.00s -> 15969.88s]  Any other games tonight?
[15982.48s -> 15984.32s]  You made Buzz and Soul Calibur.
[15984.32s -> 15985.28s]  I'm excited to see them.
[15992.00s -> 16004.45s]  I can't get anybody.
[16004.45s -> 16006.77s]  I can't get a goddamn person on my side.
[16007.49s -> 16010.72s]  Oh, that was Critical.
[16010.72s -> 16012.24s]  He's a fucking swell boy.
[16014.87s -> 16015.67s]  What am I doing?
[16016.39s -> 16040.29s]  Jerma is on a mildly drunken tirade
[16040.29s -> 16042.05s]  to tell people, to show people
[16042.05s -> 16044.61s]  that dogs have a different smell when they sleep.
[16044.61s -> 16046.39s]  All right, you can tell him
[16046.39s -> 16048.79s]  that he can smell my asshole.
[16048.79s -> 16063.62s]  So we're almost done with the engine.
[16063.62s -> 16066.87s]  Getting close.
[16068.48s -> 16070.48s]  Getting close to the engine being done.
[16070.48s -> 16073.28s]  It's a...
[16074.48s -> 16076.00s]  No, hey, we're not over the engine.
[16076.00s -> 16077.12s]  Oh, we're part of the engine too.
[16078.24s -> 16079.52s]  I'm doing more Adam Sandler.
[16079.52s -> 16080.80s]  I can't get...
[16080.80s -> 16087.43s]  What does Star have to say?
[16087.43s -> 16088.31s]  Where's Star?
[16088.31s -> 16089.19s]  Star's streaming?
[16089.19s -> 16091.17s]  I can get him.
[16091.17s -> 16107.60s]  He's off one.
[16107.60s -> 16108.40s]  Get him.
[16108.40s -> 16108.80s]  Get him.
[16109.67s -> 16110.31s]  Get him.
[16110.31s -> 16111.19s]  Like, no, no, no, no.
[16111.19s -> 16114.69s]  I mean, like, I'm the engine of the Nintendo.
[16136.88s -> 16139.04s]  Charlie just called me thin skin.
[16139.04s -> 16146.82s]  That shit to me.
[16146.82s -> 16155.86s]  Well, tell him I'm fucking busy building a lab ball.
[16155.86s -> 16160.61s]  I missed it.
[16160.61s -> 16163.83s]  Streamer battle?
[16163.83s -> 16168.93s]  Fine.
[16168.93s -> 16170.55s]  Ask him if he can do that.
[16170.55s -> 16171.75s]  Can Charlie do that?
[16171.75s -> 16174.90s]  Can Charlie do this?
[16174.90s -> 16181.19s]  Didn't think so.
[16181.19s -> 16197.03s]  Careful of dying.
[16198.07s -> 16198.95s]  I'm not dying.
[16198.95s -> 16199.59s]  I'm fine.
[16199.59s -> 16203.99s]  I can't even get a streamer to back me up.
[16203.99s -> 16205.19s]  Where's RT?
[16205.19s -> 16208.68s]  I don't need the headphones.
[16208.68s -> 16210.87s]  Is RT still here?
[16210.87s -> 16212.23s]  RT game proud?
[16212.23s -> 16235.56s]  He's down for the challenge.
[16235.56s -> 16236.92s]  Critical is down for the challenge.
[16236.92s -> 16238.12s]  There's no challenge.
[16238.12s -> 16239.40s]  I'm not challenging anybody.
[16239.40s -> 16240.36s]  I was just going like this.
[16247.67s -> 16248.31s]  End quotes.
[16248.95s -> 16249.99s]  You better watch out for this.
[16251.51s -> 16255.73s]  He's destroying me.
[16255.73s -> 16256.37s]  No, he's not.
[16256.37s -> 16257.65s]  Get that fuck out of here.
[16258.37s -> 16259.33s]  Give me those headphones.
[16259.97s -> 16262.93s]  He threw cards at me?
[16262.93s -> 16263.97s]  Cards?
[16263.97s -> 16268.20s]  What's he saying?
[16268.76s -> 16269.49s]  Give me a clip.
[16272.20s -> 16275.24s]  I know people that dogs have a different smell when they sleep.
[16276.04s -> 16276.66s]  All right.
[16276.66s -> 16279.06s]  You can tell him that he can smell my ass.
[16279.06s -> 16280.02s]  That's the same one.
[16280.02s -> 16283.06s]  What am I getting challenged to?
[16283.86s -> 16287.22s]  Jerma wants to know if I can karate chop my hand.
[16287.22s -> 16287.54s]  Like what?
[16287.54s -> 16291.62s]  Some type of fucking outraged child going through an episode?
[16291.62s -> 16293.46s]  I can do something so much better, Jerma.
[16293.46s -> 16293.70s]  Here.
[16293.70s -> 16294.90s]  You tell Jerma this.
[16294.90s -> 16299.52s]  If he wants to throw down, I'll fucking hit him with these playing cards.
[16300.08s -> 16300.88s]  Gambit style.
[16302.08s -> 16302.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[16302.96s -> 16303.28s]  I don't know.
[16303.28s -> 16304.72s]  I'm a fucking fearsome fighter.
[16305.36s -> 16307.92s]  I fucking fucking get after it.
[16307.92s -> 16308.80s]  You see this, Jerma?
[16309.84s -> 16310.16s]  Huh?
[16313.78s -> 16316.10s]  I'm not dealing with an amateur here.
[16316.10s -> 16323.86s]  I thought I was dealing with an amateur for a second.
[16323.86s -> 16327.35s]  It's fine, Charlie.
[16327.99s -> 16329.92s]  I'll get you to do this.
[16344.21s -> 16345.73s]  You couldn't even tell how fast that was.
[16383.12s -> 16383.84s]  That was so fast.
[16383.84s -> 16384.64s]  I couldn't even tell.
[16385.80s -> 16388.76s]  That kick may have been 2,000 miles per hour.
[16388.76s -> 16389.56s]  I would just be careful.
[16391.64s -> 16392.84s]  I gotta be careful every time I do that.
[16412.02s -> 16456.87s]  I have no allies.
[16456.87s -> 16457.99s]  I don't need allies.
[16459.00s -> 16465.25s]  You see the kind of fucking man I am?
[16465.25s -> 16465.97s]  Oh, I lost.
[16465.97s -> 16466.37s]  Hold on.
[16466.37s -> 16468.45s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16470.69s -> 16475.80s]  Don't need allies.
[16477.54s -> 16479.22s]  Stronger than all of them combined.
[16485.08s -> 16486.68s]  What more needs to be said?
[16487.72s -> 16488.20s]  Nothing.
[16489.80s -> 16490.52s]  You know what I mean?
[16492.36s -> 16492.92s]  It's it.
[16493.64s -> 16496.00s]  What more needs to be said?
[16504.37s -> 16505.01s]  Call Joel.
[16508.63s -> 16510.07s]  Joel, like, Vinesauce Joel?
[16511.76s -> 16513.04s]  I feel like he'd be on my side.
[16513.60s -> 16518.55s]  I mean, like, he's a fucking talented, funny man.
[16518.55s -> 16520.31s]  I feel like he'd be on my side on this.
[16520.31s -> 16521.19s]  Of course he would.
[16532.79s -> 16534.71s]  Look, I'm just trying to fucking build a labo.
[16541.70s -> 16542.82s]  Joel is streaming.
[16542.82s -> 16544.58s]  I'm sure he's streaming something fucking fun
[16545.22s -> 16546.34s]  for all of you to enjoy.
[16548.04s -> 16549.24s]  I'm gonna leave.
[16552.10s -> 16553.94s]  Stop invading streamers.
[16554.90s -> 16555.70s]  I didn't.
[16555.70s -> 16556.90s]  I didn't invade anybody.
[16557.86s -> 16558.98s]  I didn't invade anybody.
[16560.29s -> 16561.17s]  I was told...
[16564.80s -> 16566.56s]  I didn't invade anyone.
[16566.56s -> 16568.92s]  You want me to invade?
[16569.64s -> 16571.16s]  I'm giving you fucking invade.
[16571.96s -> 16577.97s]  Excuse me, Otto.
[16577.97s -> 16580.08s]  Can you move just one second?
[16580.08s -> 16582.40s]  Just move right here, Otto.
[16582.40s -> 16584.18s]  Otto, you need to move out of the way.
[16601.40s -> 16648.28s]  He's being a good keeper.
[16650.95s -> 16713.59s]  Better not be coming in here.
[16713.59s -> 16716.23s]  I told him my office was off limits.
[16716.79s -> 16719.57s]  He better not fucking come in here.
[16719.57s -> 16724.55s]  You know what I mean?
[16724.55s -> 16726.87s]  You better not fucking come in here.
[16727.51s -> 16736.71s]  See?
[16749.65s -> 16751.25s]  Can I finish the fucking steering wheel?
[16768.18s -> 16768.98s]  Piss my pants.
[16770.34s -> 16774.31s]  Where's the other piece?
[16775.11s -> 16776.07s]  I found it.
[16776.07s -> 16777.11s]  Relax, Charlie.
[16777.99s -> 16782.39s]  Yeah, I was on your podcast.
[16783.11s -> 16784.88s]  It was fun.
[16784.88s -> 16788.24s]  It was like a lot of fun.
[16789.11s -> 16791.27s]  You're like fucking cool and shit.
[16795.80s -> 16796.76s]  You're like nice.
[16796.76s -> 16797.72s]  You're like really nice.
[16798.60s -> 16800.12s]  You're like a wicked nice fucking guy.
[16800.84s -> 16804.04s]  This is a lot of fun.
[16805.22s -> 16811.99s]  Okay, so let's go.
[16815.33s -> 16823.62s]  We're in.
[16823.62s -> 16825.86s]  The little sticky outy bit on each side
[16825.86s -> 16826.82s]  pops into the gap here.
[16826.82s -> 16828.10s]  That's why it was so important
[16828.10s -> 16829.54s]  for this bit to stay unfolded.
[16831.60s -> 16832.32s]  Charlie, let me...
[16843.30s -> 16845.22s]  Ah, fucking rubber bands.
[16845.22s -> 16849.68s]  I'm muted?
[16850.50s -> 16851.22s]  No, I'm fine.
[16851.78s -> 16852.74s]  Oh, I'm fine.
[16853.54s -> 16854.50s]  Can't wait to do this,
[16854.50s -> 16855.86s]  bullshit Nintendo.
[16855.86s -> 16857.86s]  Great fucking in feature you got there.
[16858.66s -> 16862.74s]  What is this?
[16862.74s -> 16863.22s]  What is this?
[16869.96s -> 16870.84s]  Yes, a visitor.
[16873.80s -> 16876.72s]  Okay.
[16877.28s -> 16881.25s]  I was getting a drink,
[16881.25s -> 16883.09s]  but I've been stopped at the door.
[16885.19s -> 16886.55s]  Did you come in here for a reason?
[16887.75s -> 16914.34s]  Small rubber bands.
[16921.41s -> 16923.33s]  Why am I sending people to other streams?
[16923.33s -> 16924.37s]  I don't give a shit.
[16925.49s -> 16926.93s]  Ah, I just dropped one.
[16927.81s -> 16932.53s]  I broke my fucking desk.
[16948.79s -> 16950.07s]  Look, if you want to watch somebody,
[16950.07s -> 16953.75s]  I love that you want to support other streamers.
[16955.81s -> 16956.53s]  Watch Charlie.
[16956.53s -> 16957.57s]  He's good.
[16958.21s -> 16959.33s]  Italic's good.
[16960.13s -> 16960.61s]  Star.
[16962.07s -> 16963.11s]  Don't watch him.
[16964.07s -> 16965.35s]  Not that good.
[16965.35s -> 16966.23s]  It's pretty bad.
[16967.75s -> 16968.79s]  It's not good.
[16971.03s -> 16971.83s]  Vinny.
[16971.83s -> 16972.15s]  Yes.
[16973.19s -> 16974.87s]  Vinny's a fucking talented guy.
[16976.45s -> 16976.93s]  Star.
[16980.42s -> 16995.75s]  To be completely,
[16995.75s -> 16997.67s]  all complete honesty though,
[16999.80s -> 17000.68s]  Star's a great guy.
[17001.84s -> 17004.16s]  Don't think otherwise ever for any reason for real.
[17004.80s -> 17009.09s]  Okay, let's go right in the middle here.
[17009.89s -> 17010.29s]  Right here.
[17012.71s -> 17014.07s]  Natalix is not talking shit.
[17014.71s -> 17026.24s]  That's in.
[17026.80s -> 17036.76s]  I told you I had a drink to play these games.
[17036.76s -> 17037.80s]  Labo especially.
[17040.28s -> 17041.88s]  What the fuck did he say?
[17042.76s -> 17043.24s]  Wait, wait.
[17043.24s -> 17044.44s]  This is important.
[17044.44s -> 17045.64s]  I will go off.
[17046.28s -> 17049.62s]  I don't know where the fucking headphones are.
[17049.62s -> 17050.34s]  What is this clip?
[17052.95s -> 17053.67s]  Where are my headphones?
[17054.31s -> 17055.86s]  Where are my headphones?
[17059.75s -> 17060.79s]  Oh shit.
[17060.79s -> 17061.99s]  That's an Xbox controller.
[17061.99s -> 17062.31s]  Fuck it.
[17062.31s -> 17062.71s]  I'm curious.
[17062.71s -> 17063.43s]  Xbox sucks.
[17064.31s -> 17068.68s]  What is this clip?
[17087.81s -> 17089.57s]  Look at this tiny table.
[17089.57s -> 17093.25s]  That's like the little wood table from the living room.
[17093.25s -> 17096.71s]  Is that what he's trying to build the Labo on?
[17099.78s -> 17100.10s]  Yes.
[17103.46s -> 17104.26s]  Yes.
[17104.26s -> 17104.90s]  Yes, I am.
[17105.46s -> 17113.80s]  Whatever.
[17114.60s -> 17115.32s]  It's so small.
[17117.64s -> 17119.24s]  We talked about it before I started streaming.
[17119.24s -> 17119.88s]  It was like, I don't know.
[17119.88s -> 17121.24s]  Where the fuck am I going to build this?
[17123.70s -> 17134.58s]  This is what Joel said?
[17134.58s -> 17135.86s]  What did Joel say?
[17136.58s -> 17140.42s]  Another incredibly talented fucking live streamer.
[17149.01s -> 17150.05s]  Thanks for letting me know.
[17150.05s -> 17152.61s]  I really appreciate hearing about Germa, but could you chill out?
[17154.44s -> 17154.84s]  Thank you.
[17169.04s -> 17170.16s]  Joel got like mad.
[17170.96s -> 17173.84s]  Don't fuck with people if they don't want it.
[17174.87s -> 17177.91s]  He's a fucking funny like really good streamer.
[17177.91s -> 17180.07s]  Don't like make him pissed off.
[17184.05s -> 17186.29s]  Like don't like harass other people.
[17187.49s -> 17189.57s]  If they're like Charlie's into it.
[17189.57s -> 17190.85s]  It's Alex is into it.
[17190.85s -> 17192.53s]  Like if they're not just leave him alone.
[17194.20s -> 17196.68s]  He's he doesn't know the fuck is going on.
[17200.21s -> 17201.17s]  Joel's angry.
[17203.32s -> 17204.20s]  No, he sees it.
[17204.20s -> 17204.60s]  It's fine.
[17204.60s -> 17205.00s]  He's fine.
[17207.41s -> 17209.89s]  But don't just spam other people.
[17210.53s -> 17211.35s]  Please.
[17213.52s -> 17215.76s]  Oh, the the the me and Charlie and me and italics.
[17215.76s -> 17218.00s]  Yeah, that's definitely like for fun and everything.
[17218.00s -> 17222.88s]  But if Joel is trying to run a stream, don't like don't fuck with him.
[17222.88s -> 17224.00s]  It doesn't deserve it.
[17224.56s -> 17225.92s]  He's fucking a great guy.
[17225.92s -> 17228.24s]  So yes, they probably know what's going on.
[17234.21s -> 17237.49s]  But I have no idea what's going on here.
[17243.54s -> 17245.78s]  So Charlie and italics aren't great guys.
[17245.78s -> 17246.58s]  That's not what I said.
[17247.22s -> 17251.60s]  Just don't go after some random person.
[17252.32s -> 17254.58s]  We haven't we haven't I'm having fun.
[17254.58s -> 17255.22s]  You're having fun.
[17256.18s -> 17257.62s]  Charlie's having a lot of fun.
[17257.62s -> 17260.42s]  Charlie's having a lot of fun.
[17260.42s -> 17263.30s]  But like Joel had nothing to do with this at all.
[17263.30s -> 17266.26s]  Like he's just trying to run his broadcast.
[17266.26s -> 17268.10s]  Like don't don't like fuck with him.
[17268.10s -> 17268.50s]  You know what I mean?
[17272.85s -> 17273.57s]  Where are we here?
[17282.34s -> 17284.10s]  No, I have a lot of respect for Joel.
[17284.10s -> 17286.02s]  Like please don't get me wrong here.
[17286.90s -> 17289.54s]  I think he's one of the better streamers on Twitch.
[17290.18s -> 17292.18s]  There you go.
[17294.79s -> 17296.71s]  Uh rubber band two.
[17296.71s -> 17297.43s]  Sure.
[17297.43s -> 17305.27s]  I did that one.
[17305.27s -> 17306.23s]  Do how many?
[17306.23s -> 17307.19s]  What do I do?
[17307.19s -> 17311.01s]  Both sides.
[17315.27s -> 17317.11s]  Is RT game gonna get a shout out?
[17317.11s -> 17318.31s]  RT game is fucking awesome.
[17319.96s -> 17322.92s]  Literally the dude's blowing the fuck up like crazy.
[17323.72s -> 17325.84s]  Good for you, man.
[17325.84s -> 17326.72s]  For real.
[17326.72s -> 17329.75s]  I hope you're having a great fucking time.
[17329.75s -> 17333.00s]  It's a good fucking dude.
[17334.63s -> 17334.87s]  All right.
[17334.87s -> 17335.43s]  What do we got?
[17338.96s -> 17340.80s]  Same deal around the sides here.
[17340.80s -> 17342.16s]  Okay, okay.
[17350.04s -> 17350.52s]  I did it.
[17355.22s -> 17356.42s]  I finally did it.
[17363.81s -> 17365.81s]  We've been talking about dog smell.
[17365.81s -> 17366.45s]  We have not.
[17366.45s -> 17368.05s]  We invaded people's dreams.
[17372.79s -> 17378.18s]  Let's roll down.
[17378.18s -> 17379.54s]  This one is too, right?
[17379.54s -> 17380.18s]  Get it in there.
[17380.82s -> 17382.47s]  That doesn't want to stay.
[17389.68s -> 17393.04s]  A grown man has done something a child could do in 20 minutes.
[17393.76s -> 17396.00s]  He also invaded fucking critical.
[17396.00s -> 17398.28s]  What's he saying now?
[17398.92s -> 17400.60s]  No, don't.
[17400.60s -> 17402.36s]  He's, everything's, he's fine.
[17409.89s -> 17411.89s]  Joel, is Joel actually mad?
[17411.89s -> 17412.69s]  I hope he's not.
[17412.69s -> 17413.41s]  I really hope not.
[17414.05s -> 17422.34s]  I fucking hope not.
[17422.34s -> 17423.14s]  Is he actually?
[17425.62s -> 17426.98s]  No, don't fucking say that.
[17428.24s -> 17429.36s]  He seems mad.
[17429.36s -> 17430.40s]  Fucking goddammit.
[17430.40s -> 17431.36s]  Don't do that.
[17434.61s -> 17435.17s]  Yeah, he is.
[17435.73s -> 17440.64s]  I hope not.
[17440.64s -> 17442.93s]  Like, support his stream.
[17442.93s -> 17443.97s]  Don't fuck with it.
[17443.97s -> 17444.53s]  You know what I mean?
[17444.53s -> 17445.49s]  Like, please, guys.
[17445.49s -> 17445.89s]  For real.
[17457.67s -> 17458.95s]  He's having tech, okay.
[17458.95s -> 17460.23s]  Well, that's a different story then.
[17460.87s -> 17463.73s]  He seemed mad about stuff beforehand.
[17464.45s -> 17466.20s]  Chats just trolling.
[17466.20s -> 17467.08s]  Don't, please.
[17467.08s -> 17467.72s]  Come on, guys.
[17467.72s -> 17472.56s]  Like, he's, he's actually a really fucking good streamer.
[17472.56s -> 17475.92s]  Don't like, don't put this bullshit on him.
[17475.92s -> 17476.32s]  You know what I mean?
[17477.28s -> 17482.40s]  He thought chat spam was malicious.
[17482.40s -> 17483.52s]  I hope, I hope he doesn't think that.
[17483.52s -> 17483.92s]  For real.
[17487.81s -> 17489.57s]  Well, Joel, if you see this clip,
[17490.21s -> 17491.41s]  I hope you don't think that.
[17491.41s -> 17493.81s]  Because we were just having a good time.
[17493.81s -> 17494.85s]  I'm sorry, man.
[17494.85s -> 17496.61s]  I'm actually really sorry about that.
[17497.33s -> 17501.32s]  He knows.
[17502.42s -> 17502.74s]  Okay.
[17517.51s -> 17517.83s]  Okay.
[17518.55s -> 17520.71s]  So he's having like actual technical issues.
[17520.71s -> 17521.03s]  All right.
[17522.85s -> 17523.97s]  I don't want to piss people off.
[17524.93s -> 17526.93s]  I like, respect everything he does.
[17526.93s -> 17528.77s]  So like, I really hope that's not the case.
[17529.81s -> 17530.21s]  All right.
[17530.21s -> 17531.25s]  Pinch these two together.
[17531.25s -> 17532.37s]  Get off of that and get on this.
[17541.14s -> 17542.02s]  The levers are done.
[17547.59s -> 17547.83s]  All right.
[17547.83s -> 17548.55s]  We need E.
[17550.85s -> 17551.09s]  E.
[17551.65s -> 17556.74s]  Oh, what have we got for E?
[17562.92s -> 17563.40s]  I don't know.
[17565.43s -> 17565.91s]  E.
[17565.91s -> 17567.59s]  Get, why do I have these in my ears?
[17567.59s -> 17568.55s]  I'm not listening to anything.
[17572.21s -> 17572.93s]  F.
[17572.93s -> 17573.81s]  This is E.
[17575.17s -> 17585.75s]  Where the fuck is E?
[17589.30s -> 17589.62s]  I.
[17590.50s -> 17590.74s]  J.
[17598.26s -> 17598.50s]  E.
[17600.32s -> 17600.56s]  C.
[17605.49s -> 17605.73s]  A.
[17606.69s -> 17610.47s]  Oh shit.
[17610.47s -> 17611.03s]  Is this E?
[17615.43s -> 17616.95s]  This looks like, yeah.
[17616.95s -> 17617.67s]  This is part of it.
[17623.30s -> 17624.18s]  But we had our fun.
[17626.76s -> 17629.72s]  Uh, I would reiterate this one more time.
[17629.72s -> 17632.28s]  Our fun does not need to bleed into somebody else's stream.
[17634.37s -> 17636.13s]  Let them do what they want to do.
[17636.13s -> 17636.37s]  Right?
[17641.28s -> 17642.56s]  Where's the other half?
[17642.56s -> 17651.89s]  There it is.
[17651.89s -> 17655.57s]  Can you re-
[17655.57s -> 17656.21s]  I didn't have any fun.
[17656.21s -> 17657.01s]  Can you rewind?
[17657.57s -> 17671.84s]  That's it, right?
[17671.84s -> 17672.08s]  Okay.
[17675.09s -> 17675.41s]  All right.
[17675.97s -> 17681.41s]  Uh, this is done.
[17681.41s -> 17682.37s]  This moves over here.
[17686.71s -> 17687.75s]  Internet sucks.
[17688.47s -> 17691.03s]  It's been pretty stable, I think, for a while now, at least.
[17691.75s -> 17696.12s]  Let's go.
[17697.38s -> 17709.83s]  Ah, I'm going to piss my pants, though, for real.
[17710.47s -> 17711.60s]  I'm going to go pee.
[17712.72s -> 17715.20s]  Uh, I'll be back in like two minutes.
[17732.26s -> 17833.88s]  Hello?
[17833.88s -> 17838.96s]  That needs to come back.
[17842.72s -> 17842.96s]  Okay.
[17845.97s -> 17846.69s]  All right.
[17846.69s -> 17848.53s]  So I've got these pieces now.
[17849.17s -> 17859.36s]  It was actually two minutes.
[17859.36s -> 17859.92s]  I know, right?
[17861.22s -> 17861.70s]  Pretty good.
[17865.00s -> 17866.28s]  I got to get all this shit out of here.
[17866.28s -> 17867.40s]  There's some of these little knobs.
[17876.20s -> 17878.20s]  Get the fucking vacuum in here.
[17879.00s -> 17899.17s]  Why won't you come out?
[17900.12s -> 17901.40s]  What are you doing?
[17901.40s -> 17901.88s]  Why?
[17901.88s -> 17902.60s]  It's broken.
[17906.02s -> 17906.26s]  All right.
[17906.26s -> 17907.14s]  Relax, Jeremy.
[17907.14s -> 17907.54s]  You're fine.
[17909.83s -> 17913.43s]  I'm so fucking goddamn invested in this labo.
[17913.43s -> 17913.91s]  Me too.
[17914.71s -> 17916.31s]  It was 80 bucks.
[17916.31s -> 17927.60s]  So I better be so expensive.
[17927.60s -> 17937.43s]  80 bucks for cardboard.
[17937.43s -> 17944.26s]  All right.
[17944.26s -> 17944.58s]  We've got-
[17947.27s -> 17954.68s]  No, they're good.
[17957.16s -> 17958.28s]  Scuffed labo.
[17959.00s -> 17973.19s]  All right.
[17973.19s -> 17974.87s]  So this rolls over.
[17978.39s -> 17979.99s]  So roll, roll.
[17979.99s -> 17983.03s]  And then this comes down and these pieces go in.
[17985.19s -> 17985.67s]  Damn.
[17986.88s -> 17987.60s]  This is tight.
[17998.88s -> 18000.16s]  I spent money on this?
[18001.04s -> 18001.28s]  Yeah.
[18002.90s -> 18004.10s]  Fucking labo, dude.
[18004.10s -> 18004.66s]  Give me a break.
[18011.44s -> 18012.40s]  Where does this go?
[18012.40s -> 18012.64s]  What?
[18013.20s -> 18018.74s]  This goes across.
[18020.10s -> 18020.74s]  Like that?
[18021.88s -> 18022.76s]  Like that's it.
[18023.40s -> 18023.72s]  Okay.
[18029.51s -> 18030.07s]  I folded this.
[18030.07s -> 18031.35s]  That was a mistake, apparently.
[18033.20s -> 18033.68s]  That's okay.
[18033.68s -> 18034.16s]  It looks fine.
[18038.92s -> 18041.24s]  You spent 80 and made a thousand.
[18041.72s -> 18050.18s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[18051.38s -> 18052.50s]  People are so generous.
[18052.50s -> 18053.86s]  I don't even understand.
[18054.66s -> 18057.59s]  Just go to the green screen stream.
[18057.59s -> 18059.19s]  Maybe that'll be worth money.
[18059.19s -> 18065.24s]  All right.
[18065.24s -> 18066.68s]  Don't fold these.
[18066.68s -> 18067.24s]  Fold this.
[18068.74s -> 18069.14s]  Damn.
[18069.70s -> 18081.40s]  This part down.
[18081.40s -> 18082.92s]  Oh, it kind of crunches.
[18088.96s -> 18091.28s]  You know, I can sound like a broken record all I want,
[18091.28s -> 18097.09s]  but if you don't think this stream is worth paying for,
[18097.09s -> 18098.13s]  don't pay for it.
[18100.71s -> 18101.43s]  If you're like,
[18101.43s -> 18103.51s]  no, this ain't worth fucking $5 a month.
[18104.32s -> 18104.88s]  Don't do it.
[18105.44s -> 18106.80s]  I respect it.
[18109.00s -> 18109.48s]  Let's go.
[18120.48s -> 18123.89s]  How do you pirate the stream?
[18126.13s -> 18127.51s]  You just open it.
[18132.13s -> 18132.85s]  Same deal.
[18132.85s -> 18133.41s]  Fold it up.
[18134.13s -> 18135.01s]  Put it together.
[18136.05s -> 18137.01s]  Slot into slot.
[18140.05s -> 18142.37s]  I will never have a sub goal for you guys.
[18142.37s -> 18143.65s]  I'll never have a bit goal.
[18143.65s -> 18145.33s]  I never tell you guys you need to pay money.
[18145.33s -> 18147.17s]  I'll never tell you guys I need you to pay me.
[18148.53s -> 18150.29s]  If you think it was worth it,
[18150.29s -> 18151.81s]  that's a decision that you need to make.
[18152.69s -> 18154.04s]  I'm not going to make it for you.
[18154.52s -> 18155.72s]  I'm not going to make it for you.
[18155.72s -> 18174.80s]  You wouldn't pirate a stream.
[18175.60s -> 18180.36s]  This thing needs to flip around.
[18181.00s -> 18184.42s]  More merchandise.
[18184.42s -> 18185.22s]  I talked about it before.
[18185.22s -> 18187.22s]  There'll be two t-shirts that will be available
[18187.22s -> 18189.70s]  to purchase for the first time since 2014.
[18191.06s -> 18192.66s]  The glue man shirt will be coming back
[18193.84s -> 18195.84s]  as well as a planet shirt.
[18197.11s -> 18199.83s]  A solar system shirt will be available as well.
[18199.83s -> 18200.63s]  It'll be a new shirt.
[18202.31s -> 18204.39s]  If you want it, it'll be 20 bucks.
[18204.39s -> 18205.91s]  It'll never be more than that ever.
[18206.71s -> 18209.19s]  I will never charge more than $20 for a shirt
[18209.19s -> 18212.23s]  for any fucking circumstance literally ever.
[18214.45s -> 18215.81s]  And that's the way it is.
[18215.81s -> 18217.41s]  It'll be there probably in December.
[18217.41s -> 18218.77s]  Probably around Christmas time.
[18219.49s -> 18224.69s]  What about inflation?
[18225.25s -> 18235.01s]  Whatever.
[18235.01s -> 18236.37s]  That's a little nub.
[18237.17s -> 18237.67s]  Damn.
[18238.45s -> 18240.40s]  What about tax?
[18241.84s -> 18243.60s]  That's why I want to make it $20 only.
[18244.24s -> 18245.52s]  Flip it around.
[18245.52s -> 18246.48s]  Flip it all up.
[18246.48s -> 18247.12s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18247.12s -> 18247.76s]  It looks good.
[18254.66s -> 18256.82s]  It'll be on Teespring if you're curious.
[18259.84s -> 18262.00s]  I got business marks releasing during Christmas.
[18262.00s -> 18262.88s]  Well, I figured it's a...
[18263.92s -> 18266.16s]  I did it like three years ago at the same time.
[18266.16s -> 18273.11s]  So can I pay you in cardboard?
[18273.11s -> 18274.39s]  No, unfortunately, no.
[18275.03s -> 18278.58s]  Get the first straw ready to go.
[18278.58s -> 18279.62s]  Big old robot hug.
[18279.62s -> 18281.54s]  The straw line should face like you see on the screen.
[18281.54s -> 18282.10s]  Like this.
[18283.30s -> 18284.50s]  Look at that.
[18286.87s -> 18287.43s]  Not down.
[18294.04s -> 18297.96s]  So does it go straight through this slot here?
[18299.16s -> 18300.04s]  Okay.
[18300.04s -> 18300.44s]  Then what?
[18305.97s -> 18306.53s]  All the way?
[18306.53s -> 18307.03s]  Okay.
[18308.79s -> 18309.27s]  Okay.
[18309.27s -> 18310.15s]  You told me to do it.
[18310.79s -> 18314.85s]  Put the shirts on the EU site as well.
[18315.89s -> 18317.97s]  That's why I will never have a shirt more than $20.
[18319.49s -> 18323.57s]  Because it's crazy to ship internationally.
[18324.82s -> 18326.82s]  So if a shirt is like 30 bucks,
[18328.45s -> 18331.41s]  you're getting fucking screwed during the shipping process.
[18331.41s -> 18333.97s]  So those of you that are at EU,
[18333.97s -> 18335.65s]  a shirt will never be more than $20.
[18335.65s -> 18337.81s]  So if you get fucked in shipping,
[18337.81s -> 18340.53s]  it's not going to be, you know, super, super terrible.
[18341.33s -> 18345.01s]  Okay.
[18345.01s -> 18345.81s]  It's in the right spot.
[18345.81s -> 18346.29s]  Here it is.
[18348.84s -> 18349.72s]  So this has to...
[18349.72s -> 18350.44s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18350.44s -> 18353.24s]  This comes up and around like this.
[18354.20s -> 18358.40s]  This goes down and in?
[18358.96s -> 18359.36s]  Damn.
[18360.16s -> 18360.66s]  Okay.
[18361.86s -> 18370.24s]  Dreadful diapers?
[18371.44s -> 18372.88s]  I don't think this would sell very well.
[18373.60s -> 18376.85s]  Cross them down.
[18376.85s -> 18377.73s]  Mine looks fucked up.
[18385.09s -> 18387.49s]  No, I have the opinion of
[18387.49s -> 18389.57s]  if you were to go to any store
[18389.57s -> 18391.41s]  and buy like a Star Wars shirt,
[18392.37s -> 18393.41s]  which is arguably...
[18394.45s -> 18396.53s]  And arguably this is just for real.
[18398.37s -> 18399.01s]  That shit is...
[18399.65s -> 18402.93s]  That franchise is worth like hundreds of millions of dollars.
[18404.95s -> 18406.79s]  And those t-shirts are like 15 bucks.
[18408.77s -> 18411.97s]  Me selling a German 985 shirt for like $32?
[18415.00s -> 18415.48s]  No.
[18415.48s -> 18416.20s]  No fucking way.
[18416.92s -> 18421.01s]  Not even close.
[18424.29s -> 18424.85s]  That looks good.
[18425.65s -> 18429.06s]  All right.
[18429.06s -> 18430.18s]  You'd buy it for $40.
[18430.74s -> 18431.94s]  Even if you would, it doesn't...
[18431.94s -> 18432.50s]  I don't care.
[18432.50s -> 18434.82s]  I'm not selling a shirt for more than fucking 20 bucks ever.
[18435.38s -> 18438.31s]  That's a huge amount of money.
[18438.31s -> 18440.07s]  $50 from Swiggity Swanky.
[18442.36s -> 18444.12s]  I just got back from a long day at work
[18444.12s -> 18446.84s]  and had to walk an extra three miles
[18447.80s -> 18449.48s]  home after my car died.
[18450.04s -> 18452.55s]  And now I find you doing this.
[18453.89s -> 18455.25s]  You're my favorite streamer on Twitch.
[18456.55s -> 18458.31s]  I hope you got your car situation taken care of
[18458.31s -> 18459.03s]  because that sucks.
[18460.56s -> 18461.60s]  Holy shit, dude.
[18461.60s -> 18463.76s]  Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the 50 fucking dollars, man.
[18464.48s -> 18467.81s]  It's a lot of money.
[18469.52s -> 18469.84s]  Thank you.
[18471.25s -> 18472.69s]  Hopefully your car is all right.
[18474.40s -> 18476.16s]  Hey, we're building a car right now.
[18476.80s -> 18477.94s]  Maybe you can use it.
[18481.86s -> 18483.22s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[18483.22s -> 18485.54s]  50 fucking bucks and you're having like car trouble.
[18485.54s -> 18487.22s]  Please help me take care of yourself first
[18488.34s -> 18490.00s]  because that's a lot of money.
[18492.16s -> 18499.27s]  But yeah, I don't just do merch for no reason.
[18501.94s -> 18504.82s]  If it's fun, if it makes sense, sure.
[18511.75s -> 18511.99s]  All right.
[18511.99s -> 18513.11s]  You thought you were done.
[18513.11s -> 18513.83s]  Flip this piece over.
[18514.79s -> 18515.27s]  Which one?
[18523.17s -> 18524.61s]  But multi-billion dollar companies
[18524.61s -> 18526.21s]  have an advantage of market penetration
[18526.21s -> 18527.25s]  and worth and width.
[18528.05s -> 18531.65s]  Economic status quo does not equate with real
[18531.65s -> 18534.29s]  or perceived value and any economist
[18535.17s -> 18536.69s]  that tells you otherwise can't see that.
[18537.41s -> 18538.61s]  You're blowing my brain here.
[18554.20s -> 18556.76s]  No, I think 20, 25 dollars is asking a lot.
[18557.40s -> 18558.12s]  It's a lot of money.
[18560.16s -> 18561.60s]  25 bucks for a t-shirt.
[18562.56s -> 18564.56s]  That's the kind of money you spend on
[18568.88s -> 18569.92s]  like a band t-shirt.
[18569.92s -> 18571.84s]  Am I like as popular as a band?
[18573.49s -> 18575.41s]  No, I mean, I don't think so.
[18577.81s -> 18578.77s]  On drugs.
[18579.41s -> 18580.96s]  That's good.
[18581.60s -> 18586.29s]  This piece has to fold this way.
[18587.01s -> 18592.77s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18592.77s -> 18595.09s]  Spin it so the hole is up this way.
[18598.40s -> 18599.60s]  Why is it telling me to do that now?
[18600.32s -> 18605.80s]  This is gonna break.
[18609.16s -> 18609.40s]  What?
[18609.96s -> 18610.88s]  All right.
[18610.88s -> 18611.68s]  That's it.
[18611.68s -> 18620.21s]  That's good.
[18626.21s -> 18626.69s]  Locked in.
[18628.05s -> 18630.53s]  The first straw has been powered up.
[18630.53s -> 18631.09s]  Good.
[18631.09s -> 18632.05s]  That's great.
[18632.05s -> 18638.34s]  Am I making Thor's hammer?
[18638.34s -> 18638.82s]  I wish.
[18644.77s -> 18647.09s]  You have more subs than Matt Keefe
[18647.09s -> 18649.25s]  from the band Trivium who's also a streamer.
[18649.89s -> 18652.95s]  Yeah, but why if that was the case
[18652.95s -> 18654.95s]  then why would I want to tell people
[18654.95s -> 18656.39s]  to spend a shitload of money on me?
[18656.95s -> 18657.43s]  You know what I mean?
[18658.69s -> 18660.05s]  If there are people that are spending
[18660.05s -> 18661.89s]  five dollars a month on this stream already.
[18663.11s -> 18664.55s]  Hey, oh, I got a t-shirt.
[18664.55s -> 18665.59s]  It's 32 bucks.
[18666.23s -> 18667.78s]  Bullshit.
[18668.96s -> 18681.27s]  I don't believe it.
[18681.27s -> 18683.03s]  Why did you pay more for German expensive?
[18683.75s -> 18693.19s]  Yeah, they all get folded.
[18693.19s -> 18693.83s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18694.47s -> 18698.90s]  $20 is good for a t-shirt.
[18698.90s -> 18700.50s]  I agree and it'll never change.
[18701.92s -> 18704.48s]  If you ever see a t-shirt on this channel
[18704.48s -> 18708.82s]  that's more than $20, link this clip
[18711.09s -> 18712.45s]  and tell me to go fuck myself.
[18713.09s -> 18718.71s]  For real.
[18718.71s -> 18724.40s]  All right.
[18724.40s -> 18726.18s]  Does that include shipping?
[18726.18s -> 18727.14s]  It does not.
[18727.14s -> 18728.18s]  Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
[18736.92s -> 18737.48s]  Same deal.
[18737.48s -> 18738.52s]  This goes like this.
[18744.20s -> 18745.64s]  Rapid inflation.
[18745.64s -> 18747.16s]  It's not that rapid.
[18747.80s -> 18749.56s]  Very true.
[18750.44s -> 18754.72s]  Did he comment on it at all?
[18755.28s -> 18755.92s]  Comment on what?
[18759.09s -> 18760.13s]  Did I comment on what?
[18760.13s -> 18760.77s]  What are you asking?
[18761.41s -> 18769.68s]  Did I comment on what?
[18787.80s -> 18789.16s]  Hyperinflation.
[18789.16s -> 18789.88s]  Whatever.
[18789.88s -> 18797.60s]  Wait, do I have this right?
[18797.60s -> 18800.29s]  I do.
[18800.29s -> 18803.27s]  Comes in like this, like that.
[18803.27s -> 18803.51s]  Okay.
[18810.82s -> 18812.74s]  Death Grips is an anime podcast.
[18813.62s -> 18815.88s]  Well, that would have got me maybe like a year ago
[18815.88s -> 18817.24s]  but I know what Death Grips is.
[18818.12s -> 18820.04s]  Although I don't really listen to their music.
[18820.04s -> 18822.28s]  I haven't really listened very much.
[18823.24s -> 18831.20s]  That's good.
[18831.76s -> 18843.16s]  Up and around and we are closed.
[18843.16s -> 18843.66s]  Done.
[18845.14s -> 18846.74s]  So why is this one different than this one?
[18861.57s -> 18864.13s]  But the shirt that you are talking about
[18865.68s -> 18867.20s]  is a planet shirt.
[18867.84s -> 18869.44s]  It'll be like right here.
[18872.68s -> 18874.36s]  All the planets or at least most of them
[18874.36s -> 18878.55s]  most of the ones people care about should be fine.
[18889.25s -> 18890.53s]  A limited number.
[18890.53s -> 18892.05s]  No, there's no limited number of shirts.
[18892.69s -> 18894.76s]  It'll be available for about a month.
[18895.48s -> 18896.42s]  Oh shit.
[18899.91s -> 18900.41s]  Uh-oh.
[18900.89s -> 18906.33s]  Uh, this is a real...
[18906.33s -> 18906.83s]  Uh-oh.
[18917.16s -> 18917.96s]  I don't know what that is.
[18968.15s -> 18968.87s]  Got it!
[18968.87s -> 18972.01s]  Italics, I got it!
[18972.01s -> 18978.82s]  So this is fold one.
[18978.82s -> 18982.44s]  It was in here.
[18983.00s -> 18987.62s]  Fuck off, dickhead.
[18987.62s -> 18996.98s]  All right.
[18996.98s -> 18998.66s]  Uh, looks good to go to me.
[19001.27s -> 19001.91s]  Oh shit.
[19002.55s -> 19003.51s]  No, that's not good.
[19005.02s -> 19005.66s]  That's not good.
[19012.10s -> 19014.66s]  It needs to be like this but shit.
[19021.90s -> 19022.22s]  That.
[19022.22s -> 19023.10s]  Okay, that's good.
[19026.22s -> 19028.94s]  The white blip needs to be up.
[19028.94s -> 19029.44s]  Got it.
[19033.85s -> 19035.29s]  Uh, favorite band is Gorillaz?
[19035.29s -> 19037.02s]  Yes, it is.
[19037.02s -> 19038.06s]  That is for sure.
[19041.58s -> 19052.18s]  I need them sticker sheets and things.
[19052.18s -> 19061.82s]  I dropped.
[19061.82s -> 19064.14s]  All right, I need, I need, I need some water.
[19064.14s -> 19090.89s]  What are we doing here?
[19090.89s -> 19106.28s]  This is not right.
[19123.40s -> 19124.12s]  Yeah, it is.
[19124.12s -> 19128.76s]  Okay.
[19139.32s -> 19146.82s]  Oh, I got two.
[19146.82s -> 19151.48s]  Okay, I got one here.
[19151.48s -> 19156.98s]  You want me to go above it?
[19156.98s -> 19159.05s]  What the fuck do you want?
[19159.05s -> 19160.44s]  What are you talking about?
[19184.10s -> 19184.60s]  Yes!
[19235.74s -> 19236.24s]  Yes!
[19295.64s -> 19296.76s]  I'm so good.
[19296.76s -> 19298.44s]  I'm so good at what I do.
[19298.68s -> 19388.33s]  Close it all up.
[19388.33s -> 19432.25s]  I'm, I can't talk.
[19432.25s -> 19432.97s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[19432.97s -> 19488.87s]  This is too much.
[19488.87s -> 19489.43s]  Yes!
[19489.43s -> 19534.60s]  I'm sorry.
[19534.60s -> 19535.24s]  Yes!
[19535.24s -> 19552.97s]  Can you not?
[19552.97s -> 19553.93s]  I'm sorry.
[19553.93s -> 19589.62s]  Stick it in.
[19589.62s -> 19590.90s]  Uh, which way does it go?
[19590.90s -> 19599.05s]  I'm so sorry, everybody.
[19599.05s -> 19602.78s]  I thought it was funny for five seconds.
[19602.78s -> 19616.41s]  That's it, right?
[19616.97s -> 19617.53s]  Looks good.
[19623.80s -> 19624.44s]  Cheat!
[19624.44s -> 19632.74s]  Fucking idiot.
[19632.74s -> 19648.31s]  Tiny table.
[19660.92s -> 19663.48s]  Jesus, there's a lot of fold lines here, Nintendo.
[19677.05s -> 19680.60s]  Somebody said italics is drunk?
[19680.60s -> 19681.80s]  Not my stream.
[19681.80s -> 19685.14s]  Good luck.
[19685.14s -> 19690.22s]  Nothing to do with me.
[19691.99s -> 19693.19s]  Somebody else's stream.
[19693.19s -> 19693.99s]  Not me.
[19693.99s -> 19708.23s]  If I had a pet rat, what would I name it?
[19709.99s -> 19713.13s]  Um, Grento.
[19713.13s -> 19723.50s]  What the fuck is this?
[19733.14s -> 19733.70s]  Stubbier?
[19736.94s -> 19740.81s]  Stick it into here.
[19740.81s -> 19741.93s]  Fuck off, Nintendo.
[19742.57s -> 19743.21s]  Be a break.
[19745.29s -> 19759.48s]  What?
[19759.48s -> 19759.96s]  I give up.
[19759.96s -> 19760.76s]  I'm going to bed.
[19760.76s -> 19762.12s]  I'm going, I'm going to bed.
[19762.12s -> 19762.76s]  Good night.
[19762.76s -> 19786.76s]  I lost viewers.
[19786.76s -> 19787.48s]  No, I did not.
[19787.48s -> 19788.36s]  Don't say that.
[19788.36s -> 19789.77s]  No, I did.
[19789.77s -> 19808.17s]  Getting late.
[19808.17s -> 19816.23s]  It's like fucking 9, 10.
[19816.23s -> 19818.47s]  It's 1130 Eastern, guys.
[19818.47s -> 19819.62s]  I get it.
[19819.62s -> 19820.66s]  You want to go to bed.
[19820.66s -> 19821.78s]  Don't worry about it.
[19821.78s -> 19824.73s]  I'm not going to bed till this is done.
[19825.13s -> 19829.75s]  Fuck you.
[19834.90s -> 19845.02s]  It's supposed to look like that.
[19847.61s -> 19848.97s]  I don't think it's supposed to look like that.
[19851.10s -> 19851.98s]  No, I guess it is.
[19863.13s -> 19863.61s]  No, it is.
[19864.25s -> 19865.21s]  It looks like that.
[19868.28s -> 19870.04s]  It's 830 in Vegas.
[19870.04s -> 19870.60s]  Yes, it is.
[19871.16s -> 19873.16s]  But it's like fucking midnight Eastern.
[19873.16s -> 19875.24s]  That's a lot of people go on Eastern time, man.
[19878.70s -> 19881.26s]  Eastern is the time people go on.
[19881.26s -> 19887.86s]  It's a fucking red blend, man.
[19888.58s -> 19902.09s]  Lost of viewers.
[19902.97s -> 19903.77s]  It's all right, though.
[19903.77s -> 19904.25s]  I get it.
[19905.61s -> 19906.25s]  I get it.
[19906.25s -> 19906.57s]  I do.
[19907.29s -> 19908.63s]  Don't worry about it.
[19909.27s -> 19911.93s]  It's not about the viewer count.
[19912.89s -> 19914.89s]  It's about how much fun you guys are having.
[19916.31s -> 19916.87s]  It's all good.
[19919.58s -> 19921.10s]  If you're not having fun and you leave,
[19921.98s -> 19923.50s]  I'll see you next time.
[19923.50s -> 19924.22s]  I'll try better.
[19924.86s -> 19925.74s]  I'll try harder.
[19927.42s -> 19927.74s]  All right.
[19930.07s -> 19930.39s]  Done.
[19938.01s -> 19938.89s]  Using money.
[19939.45s -> 19942.58s]  That looks okay.
[19943.14s -> 19949.56s]  That doesn't look right.
[19950.20s -> 19965.45s]  Yeah, it does.
[19968.95s -> 19969.51s]  Yeah, it does.
[19971.77s -> 19972.33s]  Right.
[19972.33s -> 19984.02s]  That's correct.
[19984.58s -> 19990.78s]  All right.
[19990.78s -> 19992.23s]  Put it in the engine.
[19992.23s -> 19992.55s]  Whoa.
[19993.19s -> 20002.41s]  Put it into a V.
[20002.41s -> 20010.10s]  And then what the fuck?
[20010.10s -> 20010.98s]  I can't.
[20010.98s -> 20011.70s]  I'm going to bed.
[20011.70s -> 20012.50s]  Good night.
[20012.50s -> 20014.76s]  No, I'm just kidding.
[20014.76s -> 20016.78s]  We're going till we're done.
[20036.65s -> 20055.86s]  That's it?
[20067.77s -> 20068.01s]  G.
[20068.73s -> 20078.09s]  I need a G.
[20078.09s -> 20078.65s]  G.
[20078.65s -> 20085.62s]  Got it.
[20086.18s -> 20087.06s]  Relax.
[20087.06s -> 20107.59s]  All right.
[20107.59s -> 20111.00s]  Let's go.
[20111.00s -> 20111.88s]  Losing viewers.
[20112.44s -> 20113.08s]  Oh, well.
[20113.08s -> 20115.61s]  We tried.
[20115.61s -> 20116.01s]  All right.
[20116.01s -> 20119.72s]  Here we go.
[20119.72s -> 20123.40s]  Apparently, it tells the Toy-Con key which Toy-Con it's inside.
[20132.41s -> 20133.45s]  Viewers went up a bit.
[20134.17s -> 20138.98s]  I hope you guys are having fun.
[20138.98s -> 20145.66s]  Oh, what is this bullshit?
[20145.66s -> 20145.98s]  What?
[20145.98s -> 20146.46s]  Where is the?
[20146.46s -> 20148.54s]  I don't know what that is.
[20148.54s -> 20150.14s]  That's the fucking tar stuff.
[20150.14s -> 20150.62s]  Where's the?
[20154.18s -> 20155.54s]  Ow, my face.
[20156.18s -> 20158.57s]  The big square.
[20166.70s -> 20167.18s]  All right.
[20167.18s -> 20167.82s]  I can't.
[20167.82s -> 20169.27s]  I can't do it.
[20169.27s -> 20169.75s]  I can't.
[20169.75s -> 20171.03s]  I don't think I can do it.
[20171.03s -> 20171.43s]  Okay.
[20171.43s -> 20171.99s]  Right here?
[20171.99s -> 20184.79s]  I think Jerm is drunk.
[20184.79s -> 20186.47s]  I think Jerm might be too drunk to do it.
[20186.47s -> 20189.27s]  I think Jerm might be too drunk to do a perfect fucking square.
[20189.27s -> 20191.51s]  I think Jerm is too drunk to do a perfect fucking square.
[20209.78s -> 20210.50s]  I can?
[20210.50s -> 20217.40s]  Where does this dumb thing go?
[20220.52s -> 20221.32s]  Let him have it.
[20228.44s -> 20229.32s]  This is cool.
[20229.88s -> 20234.28s]  You better not fucking come in.
[20234.28s -> 20248.50s]  This goes down around here.
[20248.50s -> 20256.18s]  Cool.
[20256.18s -> 20256.90s]  Now you lost me.
[20259.62s -> 20264.42s]  Stretch the rubber band on the right-hand lever up and over the tabs and it sits in the notch.
[20265.14s -> 20267.35s]  Fucking shut up.
[20270.39s -> 20272.63s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[20272.63s -> 20272.95s]  Okay.
[20272.95s -> 20277.29s]  So like this over here.
[20278.82s -> 20281.06s]  I'm so good at everything.
[20281.06s -> 20282.82s]  I'm so good at everything.
[20282.82s -> 20288.46s]  Same thing on the other side.
[20288.46s -> 20292.22s]  Can I get it?
[20295.50s -> 20299.26s]  Fucking everything he does is perfect.
[20299.26s -> 20301.21s]  There it is.
[20301.21s -> 20329.35s]  Just look in there and tell me I fucking couldn't do this shit on my own.
[20329.35s -> 20335.46s]  Now we're good.
[20336.18s -> 20336.98s]  All right.
[20336.98s -> 20351.91s]  Check the right rubber band.
[20352.47s -> 20359.24s]  That's why you guys are the number one community on Twitch.
[20360.36s -> 20361.56s]  Somebody caught that.
[20362.20s -> 20363.32s]  I don't know how you did.
[20372.70s -> 20372.94s]  All right.
[20372.94s -> 20373.58s]  We're almost done.
[20384.60s -> 20385.72s]  Only three more steps.
[20392.89s -> 20393.45s]  G and H.
[20394.09s -> 20401.59s]  That's it.
[20403.85s -> 20404.09s]  H.
[20406.86s -> 20408.14s]  Uh, left side here.
[20408.86s -> 20417.24s]  Got it.
[20417.80s -> 20422.17s]  He's not coming in here.
[20422.17s -> 20426.17s]  Let me get all the nubs out.
[20431.38s -> 20446.58s]  Let me get the nubs out there.
[20446.58s -> 20446.82s]  Okay.
[20447.70s -> 20449.06s]  Looks good.
[20449.78s -> 20450.42s]  Okay.
[20455.13s -> 20455.37s]  Okay.
[20461.38s -> 20462.10s]  Now let me go.
[20473.53s -> 20474.25s]  I'm gonna go over here.
[20479.38s -> 20482.02s]  Uh, three nubs, four nubs, five nubs are out.
[20482.90s -> 20489.02s]  Okay.
[20489.02s -> 20489.50s]  Looks good.
[20493.02s -> 20494.62s]  Uh, have you dropped frames?
[20494.70s -> 20497.82s]  Uh, like a couple thousand right now, I guess.
[20497.82s -> 20498.78s]  So I'm sorry about that.
[20508.92s -> 20510.68s]  Why did that increase your viewers?
[20511.72s -> 20512.60s]  I don't know.
[20512.60s -> 20514.20s]  I don't, I don't have an answer for you.
[20514.20s -> 20515.16s]  I'm sorry.
[20515.16s -> 20525.99s]  Okay.
[20525.99s -> 20526.79s]  We're good.
[20526.79s -> 20529.50s]  Oh, okay.
[20529.50s -> 20529.98s]  We're fine.
[20531.69s -> 20533.13s]  Just check, just checking the vitals, you know.
[20533.13s -> 20534.49s]  I gotta check my vitals sometimes.
[20535.77s -> 20540.41s]  The vitals need to be checked.
[20540.41s -> 20557.22s]  All right.
[20557.22s -> 20567.69s]  What are we doing?
[20567.69s -> 20569.61s]  Don't let him re-watch this when he's sober.
[20570.89s -> 20574.09s]  Do you think it's any different than when I'm fucking not drinking?
[20576.63s -> 20577.51s]  I have nothing to hide.
[20578.15s -> 20581.13s]  Do you think I got something to hide?
[20581.93s -> 20588.81s]  Oh, wow.
[20588.81s -> 20591.45s]  I really was weird on Twitch last night.
[20591.45s -> 20591.85s]  Whatever.
[20592.49s -> 20606.38s]  Maybe I shouldn't have done that weird stuff on Twitch.
[20610.47s -> 20614.68s]  All right.
[20614.68s -> 20616.20s]  So that's good there.
[20616.92s -> 20622.57s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20622.57s -> 20622.89s]  Okay.
[20622.89s -> 20629.03s]  So Twitch fails.
[20629.99s -> 20631.27s]  What have I done that was a fail?
[20631.27s -> 20631.99s]  I didn't do anything.
[20632.87s -> 20634.89s]  I did a fake clown horn.
[20635.69s -> 20643.35s]  Perfect.
[20643.35s -> 20650.55s]  Bring this over here and fold it up.
[20651.19s -> 20653.43s]  Where does that go?
[20654.47s -> 20655.11s]  Right in the middle.
[20662.01s -> 20663.61s]  Top live stream fail.
[20664.49s -> 20667.02s]  I didn't do anything.
[20667.74s -> 20671.56s]  Looks good.
[20671.56s -> 20673.85s]  All right.
[20673.85s -> 20674.65s]  Next up is this piece.
[20674.65s -> 20675.05s]  Let's see it.
[20675.77s -> 20684.20s]  I did fail.
[20685.80s -> 20687.19s]  How?
[20687.19s -> 20689.61s]  How did I fail?
[20692.89s -> 20693.61s]  What are you talking about?
[20694.49s -> 20701.27s]  No, I get it now.
[20701.99s -> 20709.06s]  I get it.
[20709.06s -> 20709.38s]  Sorry.
[20717.42s -> 20717.98s]  Sorry.
[20717.98s -> 20726.58s]  I feel grilled.
[20728.47s -> 20729.91s]  I'm sorry you feel that way.
[20730.55s -> 20741.18s]  Is this correct?
[20741.82s -> 20745.66s]  Yeah, it is.
[20746.30s -> 20747.43s]  What the fuck?
[20747.43s -> 20748.07s]  What are these for?
[20748.71s -> 20825.75s]  That looks good.
[20825.75s -> 20826.31s]  Part H.
[20828.79s -> 20830.89s]  The last little bits here.
[20830.89s -> 20835.11s]  And then two.
[20835.11s -> 20837.40s]  What'd you miss?
[20837.96s -> 20840.34s]  You're gonna fight with Charlie.
[20840.34s -> 20845.29s]  That's pretty much it.
[20845.29s -> 20852.02s]  Looks good.
[20856.17s -> 20856.81s]  And lost.
[20860.41s -> 20861.53s]  It's funny that you think that.
[20862.33s -> 20862.65s]  Whoa.
[20863.77s -> 20864.09s]  Wee.
[20864.89s -> 20865.93s]  Wee, I'm on a swing.
[20865.93s -> 20866.97s]  Mom, push me more.
[20866.97s -> 20868.33s]  Push me a little bit higher.
[20868.33s -> 20868.81s]  That's you.
[20896.66s -> 20898.74s]  No, that was me doing that to Charlie.
[20898.74s -> 20899.46s]  Not to you.
[20899.46s -> 20901.35s]  What are you talking about?
[20901.35s -> 20902.87s]  Don't put words in my hands.
[20903.75s -> 20911.91s]  That's not right.
[20911.91s -> 20923.67s]  How many figures am I holding up?
[20923.67s -> 20924.63s]  Um, whatever.
[20924.63s -> 20925.99s]  Best of live stream fail.
[20925.99s -> 20926.87s]  What the fuck is this?
[20927.59s -> 20929.05s]  Better not fuck with me here.
[20929.05s -> 20929.93s]  Don't fuck with me.
[20932.18s -> 20933.46s]  Your friend is dying on camera?
[20934.18s -> 20936.82s]  I guess I'll have to watch that later on live stream fail.
[20937.62s -> 20940.74s]  It'll probably be the top like best of live stream fail.
[20941.70s -> 20942.58s]  Don't do that.
[20942.58s -> 20947.08s]  Hey, Shadowlight, what's up?
[20947.08s -> 20954.41s]  But yeah, I'll look at that later.
[20954.41s -> 20955.37s]  I don't care about that.
[20955.37s -> 20957.21s]  All I care about is this colony.
[20957.21s -> 20958.17s]  I have an undying.
[20960.34s -> 20960.98s]  Don't fucking.
[20960.98s -> 20962.10s]  I don't belong on there.
[20962.10s -> 20963.30s]  I didn't do anything weird today.
[20967.43s -> 20971.66s]  I didn't do anything to belong on there.
[20971.66s -> 20973.58s]  Nice people on there sometimes, you know?
[20973.58s -> 20977.27s]  But whatever.
[20977.27s -> 20979.16s]  I didn't do anything.
[20979.16s -> 20980.20s]  I didn't do anything.
[20980.20s -> 20983.90s]  So I didn't do anything weird today.
[20984.54s -> 20987.30s]  How much is the rent in Las Vegas?
[20987.30s -> 20989.30s]  $20,000 a month.
[20989.30s -> 20991.94s]  That was weird, but that's not like live stream fails weird.
[20991.94s -> 21021.61s]  I'm not weird.
[21021.61s -> 21022.94s]  I'm not.
[21022.94s -> 21024.22s]  I'm just fucking around.
[21024.22s -> 21025.02s]  I'm not weird.
[21025.02s -> 21030.39s]  What is this clip?
[21030.39s -> 21032.23s]  Nice people on there sometimes, you know?
[21032.23s -> 21036.62s]  But I didn't do anything.
[21037.18s -> 21038.84s]  I didn't do anything.
[21038.84s -> 21042.50s]  So I didn't do anything weird today.
[21043.14s -> 21045.98s]  How much is the rent in Las Vegas?
[21045.98s -> 21047.58s]  $20,000 a month.
[21048.22s -> 21049.18s]  That's not weird.
[21049.18s -> 21050.22s]  That's not weird.
[21050.22s -> 21051.46s]  That's me stating.
[21061.45s -> 21064.18s]  Hey, let me tell you guys something.
[21064.18s -> 21065.46s]  Fast forward right now.
[21066.39s -> 21068.07s]  Three or four hours from now,
[21068.07s -> 21070.55s]  I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.
[21070.55s -> 21071.99s]  My face is going to be greasy.
[21071.99s -> 21073.67s]  I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.
[21073.67s -> 21075.43s]  I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.
[21075.43s -> 21077.43s]  Water is going to be pouring down my shirt.
[21077.43s -> 21078.63s]  It's going to look really bad.
[21079.51s -> 21087.48s]  Oh yeah?
[21087.48s -> 21090.17s]  You think so, Jeremy?
[21090.17s -> 21091.42s]  Has it been two hours?
[21091.98s -> 21093.50s]  Hour and a half?
[21093.50s -> 21095.45s]  Let's take a look.
[21101.32s -> 21104.06s]  Hey, let me tell you guys something.
[21104.06s -> 21105.34s]  Fast forward right now.
[21106.22s -> 21107.98s]  Three or four hours from now,
[21107.98s -> 21110.30s]  I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.
[21110.30s -> 21110.78s]  Do I though?
[21110.78s -> 21111.90s]  My face is going to be greasy.
[21111.90s -> 21113.58s]  I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.
[21113.58s -> 21115.34s]  I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.
[21115.34s -> 21117.34s]  Water is going to be pouring down my shirt.
[21117.34s -> 21118.54s]  It's going to look really bad.
[21118.54s -> 21119.58s]  Just remember this.
[21119.58s -> 21121.10s]  Like three or four hours from now, okay?
[21122.79s -> 21123.43s]  Remember this.
[21127.42s -> 21128.54s]  Hey, say it again.
[21128.54s -> 21130.14s]  Let me tell you guys something.
[21130.14s -> 21131.42s]  Fast forward right now.
[21132.30s -> 21134.06s]  Three or four hours from now,
[21134.06s -> 21136.54s]  I'm going to look fucking way worse than I do now.
[21136.54s -> 21137.98s]  My face is going to be greasy.
[21137.98s -> 21139.66s]  I'm going to be way more drunk than I am now.
[21139.66s -> 21141.42s]  I'm going to have like a fucked up hair.
[21141.42s -> 21143.42s]  Water is going to be pouring down my shirt.
[21143.42s -> 21144.62s]  It's going to look really bad.
[21144.62s -> 21145.66s]  Just remember this.
[21145.66s -> 21147.34s]  Like three or four hours from now, okay?
[21147.34s -> 21147.90s]  Get out of here.
[21148.86s -> 21159.85s]  He's wrong.
[21159.85s -> 21160.49s]  I look the same.
[21162.46s -> 21164.30s]  All right, grub comes up.
[21164.30s -> 21165.26s]  Snap comes down.
[21165.66s -> 21166.14s]  Looks good.
[21171.38s -> 21171.94s]  All right.
[21171.94s -> 21172.74s]  Looks all right.
[21173.38s -> 21186.78s]  Has your box magically formed a nice little roof like this?
[21186.78s -> 21189.13s]  If it hasn't, go back and check.
[21190.17s -> 21192.65s]  I got a nice little roof like that.
[21192.65s -> 21202.25s]  Why am I wearing?
[21203.05s -> 21204.25s]  I'm not wearing any headphones.
[21207.96s -> 21211.18s]  Looks like Mr. Rootbox has got a hole in his forehead.
[21211.18s -> 21212.38s]  We're going to cover that up for him.
[21212.94s -> 21213.90s]  Where are those?
[21213.90s -> 21223.53s]  It's right over the lid there.
[21223.53s -> 21238.66s]  Nothing goes in there.
[21239.94s -> 21241.30s]  So it just goes up like that.
[21241.30s -> 21241.86s]  Nothing goes in there.
[21246.62s -> 21248.14s]  So it just goes over the whole thing.
[21248.14s -> 21248.46s]  Okay.
[21250.09s -> 21251.29s]  Don't fuck with me, dude.
[21251.29s -> 21252.41s]  Don't fuck with me here, man.
[21258.06s -> 21259.66s]  Oh, Jeremy's too drunk to do it.
[21260.22s -> 21263.32s]  All right.
[21263.32s -> 21265.32s]  Natalix is fucking shit faced.
[21265.32s -> 21271.67s]  Rubber band.
[21271.67s -> 21272.47s]  One of the little ones.
[21275.62s -> 21276.74s]  Small rubber band.
[21279.06s -> 21279.62s]  Two holes.
[21301.96s -> 21302.68s]  Well, it's been fun.
[21303.40s -> 21304.20s]  See you guys never.
[21304.20s -> 21306.12s]  I'm deleting my Twitch channel, my YouTube.
[21307.80s -> 21311.75s]  I'm deleting my Instagram, my Twitter.
[21311.75s -> 21312.63s]  It's all getting deleted.
[21313.88s -> 21319.45s]  Sorry.
[21319.45s -> 21320.49s]  Somebody said good.
[21321.59s -> 21322.31s]  Fuck, dude.
[21325.11s -> 21325.35s]  Good.
[21329.93s -> 21331.61s]  Damn, that makes me like sad.
[21332.41s -> 21334.12s]  Fuck.
[21334.12s -> 21340.97s]  So that's in there.
[21347.21s -> 21347.69s]  That's it.
[21350.10s -> 21350.90s]  Wait, why is it?
[21353.77s -> 21355.85s]  So that's the way it looks.
[21355.85s -> 21356.17s]  Okay.
[21359.05s -> 21359.61s]  String.
[21362.38s -> 21363.34s]  Oh, worms.
[21364.63s -> 21365.59s]  What the fuck?
[21365.59s -> 21366.31s]  It's a worm?
[21366.95s -> 21388.82s]  It's gone.
[21388.82s -> 21389.78s]  Oh, I needed that.
[21389.78s -> 21390.58s]  I need that.
[21390.58s -> 21391.54s]  I need that thing.
[21400.07s -> 21400.55s]  Okay.
[21400.55s -> 21409.38s]  I got it back like this.
[21409.38s -> 21411.54s]  Like that.
[21411.54s -> 21418.14s]  Like this.
[21419.43s -> 21422.39s]  Who just gave a hundred fucking dollars to this terrible stream?
[21431.74s -> 21436.94s]  Thank you, Deuce the Gamer for the $100.
[21440.58s -> 21443.70s]  I demand you do the submarine next.
[21443.70s -> 21444.95s]  Germa expensive.
[21445.59s -> 21453.27s]  Let's see.
[21457.54s -> 21458.98s]  Thank you for the hundred bucks though, man.
[21458.98s -> 21459.54s]  Holy shit.
[21460.10s -> 21467.51s]  That's a lot of fucking money.
[21468.07s -> 21468.47s]  We'll see.
[21470.41s -> 21471.05s]  Submarine.
[21471.05s -> 21471.61s]  You got it.
[21472.33s -> 21476.23s]  What do I do with this?
[21480.82s -> 21482.74s]  Not the end of the spring just as shown.
[21486.65s -> 21491.72s]  Oh, pretzel.
[21491.72s -> 21492.52s]  Pretzel.
[21492.52s -> 21495.32s]  That didn't work.
[21495.32s -> 21518.14s]  A hundred bucks from Kyra Toby.
[21518.14s -> 21520.31s]  Hey, Germa, I like your hair.
[21520.31s -> 21527.53s]  So much money.
[21528.41s -> 21529.37s]  So much money.
[21529.37s -> 21530.73s]  Do you like my magic trick?
[21536.74s -> 21537.22s]  Jesus.
[21539.77s -> 21543.50s]  Thank you.
[21543.50s -> 21546.78s]  Two hundred dollars for eating and regurgitating string.
[21549.59s -> 21550.39s]  Thank you, Kyra.
[21550.39s -> 21551.43s]  Thank you, Kyra Toby.
[21551.43s -> 21554.07s]  And to Deuce the Gamer, both of you guys, for real.
[21554.71s -> 21556.26s]  They liked your hair.
[21556.82s -> 21558.07s]  Thanks, man.
[21561.38s -> 21562.66s]  I still got a hairline.
[21562.66s -> 21563.22s]  Still there.
[21563.86s -> 21565.34s]  I'm thirty-three.
[21565.34s -> 21566.22s]  Thirty-three.
[21569.45s -> 21571.37s]  I'm fucking good for thirty-three.
[21571.37s -> 21572.09s]  You know what I mean?
[21572.09s -> 21583.72s]  Look, let me tie a fucking knot.
[21583.72s -> 21584.12s]  Please.
[21597.54s -> 21598.26s]  How do I do this?
[21605.42s -> 21607.34s]  I did it.
[21607.34s -> 21615.00s]  In case you're having trouble, here are some step-by-step images.
[21615.56s -> 21616.84s]  Have you made a proper knot?
[21616.84s -> 21617.08s]  I have.
[21635.21s -> 21635.77s]  What happened?
[21647.37s -> 21649.85s]  Deuce the Gamer gave a hundred dollars.
[21651.06s -> 21652.74s]  Also, the helicopter, too.
[21657.45s -> 21665.42s]  Thank you, Deuce the Gamer, for the hundred fucking bucks.
[21668.70s -> 21670.70s]  And the helicopter.
[21670.70s -> 21672.14s]  Yeah, fuck yeah, dude.
[21672.14s -> 21673.90s]  I'm not turning the stream off till it's done.
[21678.86s -> 21683.48s]  Bebraham gave twenty community subs.
[21685.96s -> 21686.84s]  Twenty of them.
[21686.84s -> 21687.24s]  Twenty.
[21691.13s -> 21692.01s]  Holy fuck.
[21692.01s -> 21692.51s]  Okay.
[21697.10s -> 21698.14s]  Thank you, Bebraham.
[21698.14s -> 21699.66s]  That's a fucking lot of subs.
[21699.66s -> 21700.54s]  And thank you for the hundred.
[21702.86s -> 21703.26s]  Two.
[21703.26s -> 21704.70s]  Three hundred dollars.
[21709.50s -> 21710.78s]  Deuce the Gamer, Karatobi.
[21710.78s -> 21711.50s]  Deuce the Gamer again.
[21723.43s -> 21732.97s]  That's a lot of fucking money.
[21741.02s -> 21741.52s]  Thank you.
[21752.15s -> 21754.31s]  No messages, really, or anything, but...
[21756.63s -> 21759.83s]  Besides, to make the helicopter and make the submachine.
[21761.03s -> 21761.53s]  Gun.
[21767.59s -> 21771.54s]  He's gonna wake up tomorrow and not know what those stacks of money are from.
[21781.40s -> 21782.12s]  Thanks.
[21782.12s -> 21785.03s]  Cry.
[21785.03s -> 21785.83s]  Cry.
[21785.83s -> 21786.71s]  Cry.
[21786.71s -> 21787.21s]  Cry.
[21789.51s -> 21799.06s]  I'm not gonna cry.
[21800.50s -> 21804.73s]  But cry, you baby.
[21804.73s -> 21805.05s]  What?
[21805.05s -> 21806.25s]  I didn't do anything.
[21806.25s -> 21807.93s]  I just didn't cry.
[21817.05s -> 21817.61s]  For real, though.
[21822.82s -> 21833.13s]  Where's the puke string?
[21839.59s -> 21840.39s]  Where's the string?
[21847.00s -> 21847.50s]  There it is.
[21850.25s -> 21851.13s]  Kidding, I'm not gonna do it again.
[21854.17s -> 21855.61s]  You guys are too fucking kind.
[21855.61s -> 21856.11s]  Seriously.
[21857.83s -> 21861.19s]  Thank you for the massive, obscene amounts of money.
[21862.25s -> 21863.21s]  Obscene.
[21863.21s -> 21865.21s]  Obscene amounts of fucking money.
[21871.74s -> 21872.24s]  Thank you.
[21881.54s -> 21882.42s]  How does this go through?
[21891.53s -> 21893.05s]  If you were rich, you'd buy me a car.
[21893.69s -> 21894.97s]  You don't have to buy me a car, man.
[21898.07s -> 21902.23s]  So many people gave so much money to this fucking stream that, you know, don't worry about it.
[21905.46s -> 21906.98s]  It's fucking hard to believe sometimes.
[21906.98s -> 21907.48s]  For real.
[21909.21s -> 21909.71s]  No jokes.
[21910.65s -> 21916.74s]  Where does this go?
[21923.70s -> 21925.70s]  This smells like the inside of my mouth.
[21941.19s -> 21941.59s]  Right.
[21941.59s -> 21942.39s]  I got it right.
[21944.86s -> 21945.50s]  Done.

[21987.48s -> 21989.40s]  Jeremy, I've been watching your streams on your YouTube for a while.
[21989.40s -> 21991.08s]  I figured I might as well join in on the meme.
[21991.64s -> 21995.64s]  Wish you the very best, as you always stay true to being a down-to-earth dude.
[21997.00s -> 21999.88s]  I can't pretend to be anybody else, so thank you.
[21999.88s -> 22001.27s]  I'm glad you think that way.
[22001.27s -> 22001.99s]  Thanks so much, man.

[22034.38s -> 22035.82s]  All right, that looks good, right?
[22036.86s -> 22037.58s]  That looks correct.
[22052.90s -> 22061.85s]  What are you doing?
[22065.24s -> 22065.96s]  Fifty.
[22065.96s -> 22066.76s]  Five zero.

[22098.14s -> 22102.71s]  I can't even fucking comprehend this right now.
[22120.20s -> 22123.93s]  Show us your dick.
[22124.81s -> 22125.85s]  I read that.
[22125.85s -> 22126.81s]  I read that out loud.
[22127.45s -> 22128.01s]  Uh, no.
[22130.10s -> 22136.82s]  Uh, Tora, Tora, that's an insane amount of fucking gifted subs.
[22139.83s -> 22143.11s]  That's an in-fucking-sane amount of people to give subs to.
[22145.94s -> 22153.67s]  Uh, don't make it a competition.
[22153.67s -> 22154.87s]  I hope it's not.
[22154.87s -> 22156.71s]  Don't treat this like a competition, guys.
[22160.38s -> 22161.82s]  Uh, it's not.
[22161.82s -> 22168.78s]  So, uh, that's like, that's $250 somebody just spent right now.
[22168.78s -> 22169.26s]  Tora T.
[22170.06s -> 22177.40s]  So don't, don't let me get away with this.
[22177.40s -> 22177.96s]  You know what I mean?
[22178.92s -> 22181.51s]  And here's what I mean by that.
[22183.37s -> 22188.89s]  Uh, there's like 10 different, like, huge streams I want to do.
[22190.46s -> 22195.18s]  Uh, don't let me just like, oh, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[22195.18s -> 22196.30s]  Oh, I just didn't do it.
[22197.18s -> 22202.94s]  It's a lot of fucking money for someone to have.
[22204.07s -> 22205.11s]  And I want to use it.
[22213.34s -> 22215.58s]  Don't, don't let me just fucking take your money and like rung.
[22216.54s -> 22224.65s]  Because you deserve, uh, you deserve to have something to show for it.
[22224.65s -> 22228.65s]  I can't fucking imagine spending two, three, four hundred fucking dollars on somebody.
[22237.56s -> 22239.08s]  I hope it's worth your while.
[22239.08s -> 22239.56s]  I'll try.
[22240.52s -> 22240.92s]  Thank you.
[22242.68s -> 22245.80s]  Uh, Tora T for the fucking insane amount of subscriptions.

[22252.12s -> 22253.40s]  You guys are all fucking insane.
[22253.40s -> 22254.36s]  You guys are all incredible.
[22255.08s -> 22256.44s]  Do we have a date for the green screen?
[22256.44s -> 22257.16s]  Yes, Thursday.
[22257.16s -> 22258.52s]  Thursday is the green screen.
[22263.22s -> 22265.02s]  There is a date.
[22265.66s -> 22270.94s]  All right.
[22270.94s -> 22271.58s]  We need the engine.
[22276.78s -> 22278.14s]  I don't take this shit for granted.
[22278.14s -> 22279.26s]  I try not to.
[22279.26s -> 22280.22s]  I really don't want to.
[22281.02s -> 22284.02s]  It's a lot of fucking money.
[22285.98s -> 22287.26s]  Somebody has to fucking make that money.
[22287.26s -> 22288.30s]  Somebody has to work for that money.
[22288.30s -> 22289.66s]  Somebody has to make that fucking money.
[22289.66s -> 22290.14s]  You know what I mean?
[22291.18s -> 22296.25s]  That money comes from somewhere, you know, for free.
[22297.29s -> 22300.41s]  I hope you realize I don't fucking take that for granted at all.
[22306.97s -> 22312.55s]  Drugs, drugs.
[22313.59s -> 22318.63s]  This is, this is me working for that money.
[22319.43s -> 22322.76s]  If you say so.
[22322.76s -> 22326.18s]  I just, we've talked about a thousand times.
[22329.19s -> 22336.26s]  Let me at least try to make it fucking worth you being here.
[22338.79s -> 22339.51s]  I'll break it.
[22345.38s -> 22346.18s]  That's correct, right?
[22350.41s -> 22352.09s]  Oh, even more subscription.
[22352.09s -> 22354.33s]  Nat Kitty gives five community subs.
[22355.91s -> 22356.31s]  Thank you.
[22357.03s -> 22359.83s]  It's never ending, Tim Allen.
[22359.83s -> 22361.27s]  It's not going to stop for a long time.
[22365.80s -> 22368.36s]  Don't underestimate the power of entertaining someone.
[22369.91s -> 22373.03s]  Yeah, but money, it's a lot of fucking money, man.
[22375.34s -> 22377.50s]  Some of you guys pay 10 bucks a month for Netflix.
[22380.26s -> 22381.70s]  I got to at least try.
[22381.70s -> 22382.66s]  You know what I'm saying?
[22382.66s -> 22384.82s]  Like, I got to fucking at least try.
[22399.13s -> 22401.21s]  You're more entertaining than Netflix, to be honest.
[22402.09s -> 22403.94s]  If you say so, I hope so.
[22406.10s -> 22406.42s]  Thank you.
[22411.59s -> 22414.39s]  Well, you do what you do without a salary.
[22416.50s -> 22418.50s]  You guys pay my fucking salary.
[22418.50s -> 22419.94s]  So that's what this shit is all about.
[22421.69s -> 22423.05s]  Just look at the last 20 minutes.
[22428.22s -> 22431.26s]  You guys pay my fucking salary.
[22433.40s -> 22435.40s]  It had better be worth it.
[22449.32s -> 22450.44s]  So where are you, boss?
[22451.40s -> 22453.48s]  In a sense, kind of, yeah.
[22457.99s -> 22459.83s]  Novi came in with five community subs.
[22460.47s -> 22461.75s]  Five community subs of Novi.
[22463.88s -> 22465.24s]  This year, cry.
[22465.24s -> 22466.36s]  I'm not going to cry.
[22469.56s -> 22471.64s]  I'm not going to cry, okay?
[22475.70s -> 22478.82s]  Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.
[22493.03s -> 22504.42s]  Bebraham gave 20 more, so thank you, Bebraham.
[22511.26s -> 22516.02s]  I just want you guys to leave each stream and say that was fun.
[22516.02s -> 22518.56s]  That's it.
[22518.56s -> 22528.78s]  I'm going to cry.
[22529.66s -> 22531.29s]  I'm not going to fucking cry.
[22532.41s -> 22539.68s]  Whoa, am I still on this?
[22539.68s -> 22541.04s]  People are giving a lot of money.
[22544.22s -> 22545.42s]  Somebody said wimp.
[22546.70s -> 22548.54s]  I didn't, that was a pretend.
[22548.54s -> 22549.74s]  All right, what do I do with this thing?
[22550.97s -> 22553.37s]  Thank you for the 20 fucking community subs, dude.
[22554.72s -> 22555.22s]  Jesus.
[22558.28s -> 22560.36s]  Just wait till the green screen stream.
[22561.00s -> 22562.12s]  That's going to be a ton of fun.
[22564.38s -> 22567.02s]  Week or two later, we're going to have a fucking movie night.
[22568.14s -> 22570.22s]  Then like two weeks later, there's going to be something else.
[22571.10s -> 22578.30s]  Christ.
[22592.68s -> 22594.92s]  Thank you, Kairatobi for the 20 subs.
[22596.51s -> 22598.43s]  20 community subs from Kairatobi.
[22604.88s -> 22606.72s]  A lot of fucking people and a lot of subs.
[22606.72s -> 22608.80s]  20 people even is a lot of people.
[22613.84s -> 22616.00s]  Proud pleb forever.
[22617.44s -> 22620.08s]  And I'm, I, that's fine.
[22621.44s -> 22622.48s]  That's fine, man.
[22622.48s -> 22625.53s]  Like it's, it's fine.
[22625.53s -> 22627.21s]  Like I don't, you don't have to subscribe.
[22628.89s -> 22632.20s]  Did you have any fun?
[22632.20s -> 22634.04s]  If the answer was yes, then that's fucking fine.
[22638.73s -> 22641.13s]  You've made $250 an hour this stream.
[22641.85s -> 22644.06s]  That's more money than a fucking doctor.
[22646.78s -> 22647.50s]  Do you understand?
[22649.50s -> 22651.10s]  Sometimes people, why, why do you feel this way?
[22651.10s -> 22652.06s]  Why do you act like that?
[22652.06s -> 22653.10s]  And people are just giving you money.
[22653.10s -> 22654.78s]  That's like more money than a fucking surgeon.
[22655.98s -> 22662.27s]  So sorry that sometimes I can be like, I hope it's fucking worth it.
[22662.91s -> 22665.07s]  Cause I really believe that.
[22668.49s -> 22672.78s]  All right.
[22672.78s -> 22674.22s]  Thread the ring.
[22676.32s -> 22678.16s]  It's way more than $250 an hour.
[22679.69s -> 22681.13s]  I can't even fucking comprehend it.
[22692.20s -> 22694.20s]  Earning more than a mosquito doctor.
[22694.20s -> 22696.20s]  Way more than a mosquito doctor, dude.
[22696.84s -> 22697.96s]  A thousand times more.
[22713.98s -> 22715.74s]  $900 over six hours.
[22720.40s -> 22721.76s]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[22733.71s -> 22738.75s]  Right, right.
[22738.75s -> 22739.87s]  You make me sick.
[22739.87s -> 22740.51s]  L-U-L.
[22745.26s -> 22749.56s]  I'm sorry you feel that way.
[22749.56s -> 22753.29s]  I'm trying.
[22755.10s -> 22757.58s]  This year, 2019 especially.
[22768.03s -> 22768.91s]  He's close.
[22769.79s -> 22770.91s]  I'm not going to cry.
[22774.60s -> 22775.16s]  Cry.
[22779.28s -> 22780.16s]  How do you make a knot?
[22783.39s -> 22784.19s]  Yes, you are.
[22784.19s -> 22785.63s]  I'm not close to crying.
[22806.33s -> 22808.25s]  Tie it off completely.
[22815.80s -> 22817.80s]  This is what the real thing should look like.
[22817.80s -> 22819.00s]  Does your knot look the same?
[22820.27s -> 22823.31s]  It's a little long, but it will get the job done.
[22823.95s -> 22827.16s]  Cry or pre-record it.
[22827.96s -> 22837.32s]  Crying will make you feel better.
[22837.32s -> 22848.52s]  Put a round.
[22857.39s -> 22860.88s]  All right, leave it.
[22860.88s -> 22861.84s]  I'll get the hiccups now.
[22865.68s -> 22867.20s]  Oh, I got the fucking hiccups.
[22867.76s -> 22879.26s]  This goes through here, there.
[22880.86s -> 22883.02s]  All right, so that is situated.
[22883.02s -> 22883.50s]  It's done.
[22884.22s -> 22886.78s]  He's trying to hold back the tears.
[22891.79s -> 22894.03s]  Seven years ago when I made my first YouTube video.
[22896.33s -> 22902.86s]  Never in a million fucking years did I think I'd be sitting down in Las Vegas
[22904.62s -> 22906.14s]  with a ton of fucking supporters.
[22907.55s -> 22910.17s]  Just giving me fucking money.
[22912.09s -> 22913.05s]  Never in a million years.
[22919.42s -> 22920.14s]  Ever.
[22920.14s -> 22931.48s]  He's getting reversed cyberbullying.
[22935.66s -> 22937.58s]  I got a free vibe this video.
[22942.51s -> 22945.87s]  Well, if you never think it's worth doing, don't up your subscription.
[22945.87s -> 22947.23s]  I've said that before and I'll say it again.
[22949.69s -> 22955.53s]  If you watch and over time, over months or six months, two months, three months,
[22955.53s -> 22957.77s]  one month and you're like, I don't care anymore.
[22957.77s -> 22959.05s]  This is not fucking fun anymore.
[22960.17s -> 22963.69s]  Do not pay me any more money because I wouldn't deserve it at that point.
[22964.65s -> 22966.48s]  Hi.
[22979.18s -> 22987.68s]  That's it, right?
[22989.50s -> 22990.14s]  What's next?
[22990.94s -> 22999.55s]  I got two of these, right?
[22999.55s -> 23000.91s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23005.69s -> 23007.69s]  Thank you butterdurk for the $15.
[23007.69s -> 23009.53s]  Jerma, I don't leave your stream saying that was fun.
[23009.53s -> 23011.61s]  I leave your stream saying no, please don't leave.
[23012.41s -> 23013.77s]  It's a unique feeling.
[23013.77s -> 23016.33s]  Nothing else has ever replicated.
[23027.39s -> 23027.79s]  Thank you.
[23028.51s -> 23031.95s]  Uh, also, uh, nksaur says, I like that you hold,
[23031.95s -> 23035.63s]  you like that you must hold you accountable for making quality content.
[23036.35s -> 23038.08s]  Well, what else are you paying for?
[23039.87s -> 23040.35s]  You know what I mean?
[23042.41s -> 23043.69s]  Think, like really think about that.
[23043.69s -> 23044.33s]  Like think about it.
[23045.69s -> 23047.24s]  Like, oh, thanks for the sub.
[23047.24s -> 23048.12s]  Thanks for the sub.
[23048.12s -> 23049.08s]  Thanks for the sub, man.
[23049.64s -> 23050.81s]  Like, what are you paying for?
[23059.48s -> 23067.07s]  You have actively decided on your own free will to continuously,
[23068.03s -> 23076.80s]  continuously for a lot of people, pay to my bank account a monthly payment.
[23081.05s -> 23085.20s]  At some point, you have to think about like, what, what am I paying for?
[23085.84s -> 23089.58s]  Just, oh, I want to give you money because I'd like you.
[23089.58s -> 23090.08s]  Okay.
[23091.02s -> 23092.46s]  Thank you so much.
[23092.46s -> 23094.72s]  But what are you paying for?
[23101.45s -> 23103.85s]  That's something that I fucking think about all the time.
[23110.19s -> 23111.07s]  Which is why?
[23111.07s -> 23112.16s]  Oh, do this.
[23112.16s -> 23112.72s]  I want to try that.
[23112.72s -> 23113.28s]  I want to try this.
[23113.28s -> 23114.24s]  I want to try something like that.
[23114.24s -> 23115.12s]  I want to do something new.
[23115.12s -> 23116.16s]  I want to bring something new.
[23116.16s -> 23117.20s]  I want to let's, let's do a skit.
[23117.20s -> 23118.48s]  Let's do a fucking community event.
[23119.20s -> 23120.89s]  That's why I want to do that shit.
[23144.32s -> 23153.71s]  That's $500 from Deuce the Gamer.
[23162.11s -> 23162.59s]  What you've
[23170.17s -> 23174.76s]  five, that's some, I think that's the most amount of money I've ever seen in one bit.
[23176.01s -> 23177.61s]  That's fucking ridiculous, man.
[23179.92s -> 23181.36s]  That's ridiculous.
[23182.16s -> 23186.00s]  That is like a month of fucking like a part-time income.
[23187.21s -> 23188.25s]  Like two or three weeks.
[23193.68s -> 23203.76s]  Uh, and Deuce the Gamer says, uh, oh yeah, before I go, please do a Fortnite dance.
[23204.40s -> 23207.37s]  I told you my favorite for entire.
[23207.37s -> 23212.38s]  Uh, yeah, this one, the one with the fucking kid with the backpack on this one.
[23224.24s -> 23229.87s]  There's a lot coming.
[23230.75s -> 23236.67s]  Uh, and a ton of you people have paid for it.
[23238.28s -> 23243.15s]  Already like a ton of you guys have paid for it.
[23245.32s -> 23248.52s]  I hope the things that you will see in the next couple of months.
[23249.32s -> 23251.08s]  Do you think of fun?
[23251.08s -> 23252.84s]  That's all I can say.
[23257.36s -> 23265.45s]  The power of Christ compels you.
[23268.03s -> 23270.27s]  Streamer does anything for money.
[23271.95s -> 23274.27s]  It's five fucking hundred dollars.
[23284.00s -> 23287.20s]  I can't, I still can't fucking believe it whenever it happens, man.
[23287.84s -> 23290.88s]  That's the most I think I've ever seen in my life.
[23290.88s -> 23300.80s]  Show your dick.
[23302.24s -> 23307.28s]  Why would I show my dick now of all the times to ask for that?
[23308.67s -> 23310.91s]  Why would that happen now?
[23311.79s -> 23314.97s]  I can't even pay attention to this.
[23334.84s -> 23335.08s]  All right.
[23335.08s -> 23335.80s]  Where did these go?
[23344.59s -> 23345.63s]  Make his dick cry.
[23363.77s -> 23365.69s]  I need, uh, I need the engine thing back.
[23366.65s -> 23372.78s]  Where does this go?
[23374.09s -> 23376.09s]  Circle through here.
[23377.77s -> 23388.49s]  I'm just glad you find happiness in this stream.
[23390.33s -> 23391.61s]  I don't have much else to say.
[23392.33s -> 23396.32s]  I could go off on like a tangent about it.
[23396.32s -> 23397.76s]  I've done it a couple times already.
[23415.07s -> 23420.17s]  There are some streams that when I end them, I'm lying in bed
[23421.13s -> 23425.85s]  and I look at the ceiling and I just say to myself,
[23425.93s -> 23427.85s]  holy fucking shit dude.
[23429.92s -> 23432.08s]  How, what happened?
[23432.96s -> 23434.24s]  How was that even possible?
[23434.96s -> 23436.94s]  This is gonna be one of them.
[23449.31s -> 23450.67s]  What, what happened?
[23461.24s -> 23462.68s]  Why are you not crying yet?
[23463.88s -> 23465.32s]  Because there's no reason to cry.
[23466.12s -> 23469.32s]  There's no, I don't have a reason to cry.
[23470.36s -> 23471.64s]  I have a reason to be very happy.
[23473.56s -> 23475.88s]  And incredibly importantly,
[23476.60s -> 23480.38s]  I have a lot of reasons to be very, very, very happy.
[23481.48s -> 23485.16s]  And a ton of the messages that I read from people are about,
[23486.20s -> 23489.00s]  hey dude, uh, my life like sucks.
[23502.54s -> 23503.58s]  He's getting close.
[23508.49s -> 23509.93s]  And it's like, fuck man.
[23512.36s -> 23514.12s]  Like, oh, like I've had such a hard time.
[23514.12s -> 23516.52s]  Like this stream is so much fun.
[23516.52s -> 23519.95s]  And you don't think that I think about that?
[23519.95s -> 23520.91s]  Like all the fucking time?
[23520.91s -> 23521.47s]  You know what I mean?
[23521.47s -> 23540.84s]  And then I see like huge, fucking huge amounts of money
[23540.84s -> 23541.56s]  coming to the stream.
[23541.56s -> 23544.30s]  It's like, god damn.
[23548.11s -> 23549.71s]  It better be fucking worth it.
[23550.27s -> 23551.15s]  It better be.
[23553.20s -> 23555.12s]  I'm just happy to fucking hang out and be here, man.
[23558.89s -> 23560.57s]  You're trying to get it.
[23560.57s -> 23561.85s]  You almost got it.
[23561.85s -> 23562.41s]  It was close.
[23563.13s -> 23564.09s]  It was real close.
[23568.25s -> 23569.93s]  You made yourselves cry.
[23572.99s -> 23573.79s]  But that's for real.
[23576.36s -> 23582.97s]  I actually, I saw a clip of Creparian who mentioned something similar.
[23584.11s -> 23587.23s]  And I have a lot of respect for Creparian.
[23587.23s -> 23589.23s]  He's kind of an OG in this space, right?
[23590.60s -> 23595.45s]  But it's like, whenever I hear something like that,
[23596.48s -> 23598.32s]  I start to internalize it, you know?
[23598.32s -> 23601.12s]  And I try to think about, you know,
[23601.12s -> 23602.40s]  I want to make sure that person's all right.
[23602.40s -> 23603.68s]  I mean, the person's having fun.
[23603.68s -> 23604.40s]  The person's okay.
[23604.40s -> 23604.88s]  You know what I mean?
[23605.76s -> 23609.60s]  It's something that you think about a lot.
[23613.77s -> 23616.25s]  It just got to that donation now.
[23616.25s -> 23617.53s]  Yeah, there it is.
[23618.17s -> 23619.21s]  Five fucking hundred.
[23624.06s -> 23627.29s]  But yeah, if you think of that,
[23627.29s -> 23629.45s]  that's something that I'm not the only one, you know?
[23629.45s -> 23632.17s]  There's plenty of other streamers and content creators
[23632.17s -> 23635.07s]  that take a lot of, you know, pride
[23635.07s -> 23639.95s]  and a lot of, they're like, wow,
[23639.95s -> 23641.47s]  I'm actually helping somebody.
[23641.47s -> 23643.55s]  Like, it means a lot to hear that.
[23645.31s -> 23646.75s]  I heard Crip say that the other day
[23646.75s -> 23647.95s]  and I was like, holy shit.
[23647.95s -> 23649.79s]  I'm like, all right, well, respect for you.
[23649.79s -> 23652.19s]  Just increased by fucking a thousand percent.
[23652.19s -> 23652.67s]  You know what I mean?
[23657.02s -> 23659.36s]  But Crip is Crip.
[23659.36s -> 23660.80s]  You know, everybody knows who that is.
[23661.68s -> 23666.27s]  He's going to retire.
[23667.39s -> 23668.27s]  Not in the plans at all.
[23671.18s -> 23672.54s]  Who is preparing it?
[23672.54s -> 23673.58s]  You don't, Crip?
[23673.58s -> 23674.46s]  You don't know who Crip is?
[23674.46s -> 23674.94s]  Come on.
[23677.23s -> 23678.11s]  You don't know who Crip.
[23678.11s -> 23679.55s]  He's like Hearthstone, Diablo,
[23680.27s -> 23681.15s]  Path of Exile.
[23681.95s -> 23686.89s]  I've never heard of that person in my life.
[23686.89s -> 23690.64s]  Crip is a salty baby who cries over children's card games.
[23690.64s -> 23697.20s]  Well, excuse me.
[23698.08s -> 23700.24s]  What am I doing right now?
[23701.44s -> 23702.96s]  What is this?
[23703.76s -> 23705.92s]  This is, this is an adult game.
[23707.84s -> 23713.16s]  But for real, you guys are fucking awesome.
[23713.16s -> 23714.20s]  Don't ever think differently.
[23715.63s -> 23718.33s]  There's so many different kinds of people.
[23718.33s -> 23721.16s]  So many different points of views.
[23721.16s -> 23722.92s]  So many different fucking people here.
[23722.92s -> 23724.60s]  I don't even know who Crip is.
[23724.92s -> 23726.04s]  So many different points of views.
[23726.04s -> 23727.56s]  So many different fucking people here.
[23729.21s -> 23732.73s]  This channel is, over the last three years,
[23735.72s -> 23736.76s]  has grown a lot.
[23736.76s -> 23739.08s]  And it's gotten to a point where there's so many people here.
[23740.04s -> 23741.16s]  Just happy you're fucking here.
[23742.44s -> 23742.92s]  And that's it.
[23744.88s -> 23746.12s]  Let's finish the car.
[23750.91s -> 23752.19s]  I am a people.
[23753.87s -> 23755.71s]  Cry, cry, cry, cry.
[23758.64s -> 23758.88s]  All right.
[23760.08s -> 23761.12s]  What is this even here for?
[23761.12s -> 23761.84s]  Get this out of here.
[23762.48s -> 23768.08s]  And there's so many streamers and so many people
[23768.08s -> 23769.44s]  that are doing the same things.
[23769.44s -> 23770.56s]  So many people to support.
[23770.56s -> 23772.56s]  So many people that are worth your time.
[23772.56s -> 23776.00s]  It's just remarkable that a lot of you are here right now.
[23776.96s -> 23778.00s]  This late as well.
[23783.52s -> 23784.72s]  Through and down.
[23789.42s -> 23790.78s]  We only liked your hairstyle.
[23796.44s -> 23798.12s]  We almost made it, you almost, almost.
[23798.12s -> 23799.16s]  It got real close.
[23799.88s -> 23803.48s]  I could feel like the, I could feel the fucking chest pain.
[23803.48s -> 23808.35s]  Where it was like, hey, I'm good.
[23808.35s -> 23820.97s]  But it's something I think about a lot.
[23822.67s -> 23824.59s]  And if you think that's just a joke,
[23825.31s -> 23827.39s]  I'm sorry, but that's not part of the routine.
[23831.29s -> 23837.63s]  I found out you were streaming and I've been here since.
[23837.63s -> 23839.39s]  I can't, I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.
[23840.11s -> 23842.43s]  Thank you, Butterdirt, for real.
[23842.43s -> 23847.64s]  As long as we're all having fun, right?
[23848.36s -> 23852.59s]  That goes in, that goes forward, I hope.
[23854.40s -> 23855.12s]  Does that look right?
[23859.39s -> 23860.49s]  That looks wrong.
[23868.35s -> 23868.91s]  No, that's right.
[23868.91s -> 23869.39s]  That's right.
[23869.39s -> 23869.79s]  That's right.
[23869.79s -> 23870.27s]  I got it.
[23870.27s -> 23870.83s]  That's right.
[23876.97s -> 23879.37s]  Can't wait till you, we're here till 6 a.m.
[23879.37s -> 23881.13s]  Well, for however long we're here, we're here.
[23883.24s -> 23883.80s]  All right, hold on.
[23883.80s -> 23884.68s]  I gotta look at this.
[23884.68s -> 23885.96s]  I need this thing back.
[23888.43s -> 23890.99s]  I need the little fat one.
[23897.15s -> 23897.95s]  And there it is.
[23901.90s -> 23911.37s]  A little bump right across the bump.
[23912.17s -> 23914.28s]  Close enough, I would say.
[23917.76s -> 23920.48s]  Jerma, here's a dollar for your crippling chicken nugget addiction.
[23921.12s -> 23922.32s]  It's fucking crazy, dude.
[23922.32s -> 23923.04s]  I'm sorry, I know.
[23923.60s -> 23928.73s]  The roof still goes up.
[23928.73s -> 23929.13s]  It does.
[23933.88s -> 23935.72s]  All right, we don't need these anymore.
[23936.36s -> 23940.51s]  So where the hell does this go?
[23941.07s -> 23953.50s]  This goes in here with the, oh, this is not right.
[23962.06s -> 23962.54s]  Yeah, it is.
[23963.74s -> 23966.60s]  Ah, that was a loud noise.
[23969.31s -> 23969.63s]  Don't!
[23973.84s -> 23976.64s]  Uh, Tiny, thank you, Tiny840 for the 10 bucks.
[23976.64s -> 23979.04s]  I can't give nearly as much as some people have here.
[23979.92s -> 23982.64s]  But I just want to show my appreciation for what you do for all of us.
[23982.64s -> 23983.04s]  Keep it up.
[23985.56s -> 23989.16s]  You never expected Tiny to give a fucking huge amount of money.
[23990.36s -> 23990.68s]  Ever.
[23992.03s -> 23994.75s]  Don't ever feel obligated to pay the stream money.
[23994.75s -> 23996.43s]  Just, if you're here, you're here.
[23999.32s -> 24000.04s]  Thank you.
[24000.04s -> 24000.76s]  That means a lot.
[24001.85s -> 24003.69s]  Two dollars, one dollar, a hundred dollars.
[24003.69s -> 24005.45s]  Like, it's all the same.
[24006.01s -> 24009.05s]  Somebody decided to give money to me today.
[24009.85s -> 24015.87s]  Because I think about me, right?
[24016.43s -> 24020.03s]  If I was in a stream and giving somebody a hundred fucking dollars.
[24029.29s -> 24030.70s]  You know how it is.
[24032.17s -> 24032.57s]  Thank you.
[24034.04s -> 24034.36s]  Cry.
[24036.44s -> 24038.52s]  It almost, it almost happened.
[24038.52s -> 24040.28s]  It was really fucking close.
[24040.28s -> 24041.80s]  It was so close.
[24041.80s -> 24043.88s]  You don't have any idea how close that was.
[24043.88s -> 24044.44s]  That was like...
[24047.80s -> 24051.76s]  Here we go.
[24051.76s -> 24054.73s]  Lock it in.
[24055.29s -> 24060.46s]  Push him over the edge.
[24063.56s -> 24066.12s]  Somebody give a thousand dollars.
[24067.24s -> 24069.31s]  Don't do that.
[24073.08s -> 24076.68s]  Do not give me a thousand dollars.
[24077.48s -> 24078.60s]  For any reason.
[24079.40s -> 24080.12s]  I mean, ever.
[24080.92s -> 24083.48s]  All right.
[24083.48s -> 24087.05s]  So I can turn this.
[24087.77s -> 24090.30s]  Okay, it's turned.
[24090.94s -> 24094.52s]  This goes in there.
[24097.39s -> 24099.55s]  Somebody give him a thousand dollars.
[24099.55s -> 24100.91s]  Get him over the edge.
[24105.53s -> 24108.09s]  Maybe two rubber bands.
[24108.81s -> 24113.00s]  One, two.
[24117.39s -> 24119.55s]  One dollar equals one tier.
[24120.83s -> 24122.65s]  Two of them together.
[24122.65s -> 24123.95s]  Okay.
[24123.95s -> 24124.51s]  Double thick.
[24134.04s -> 24135.48s]  So these go over this.
[24136.44s -> 24139.05s]  Okay.
[24139.77s -> 24148.01s]  Around there.
[24152.25s -> 24158.59s]  Good.
[24158.59s -> 24159.31s]  Yeah, it's still there.
[24160.03s -> 24164.49s]  Try pulling the reverse lever of the rubber band.
[24164.49s -> 24165.37s]  Snaps it back.
[24165.37s -> 24166.17s]  It's a retrofixer.
[24176.78s -> 24183.76s]  Want to see the internal guts?
[24185.79s -> 24187.63s]  Oh, yeah.
[24187.63s -> 24190.09s]  It's good.
[24190.09s -> 24194.60s]  Try pulling this pull cord, too.
[24194.60s -> 24196.04s]  It should snap back as well.
[24214.94s -> 24215.58s]  Fifty bucks.
[24216.40s -> 24218.00s]  From Visual Warlock.
[24221.98s -> 24225.82s]  Jerma, I found your Jerma Rumble videos on YouTube and instantly became a fan.
[24226.78s -> 24228.62s]  You're one of the genuinely funny people on Twitch.
[24229.34s -> 24231.74s]  And I want to say thanks for making me laugh every time on stream.
[24233.96s -> 24235.00s]  Thank you, Visual Warlock.
[24237.74s -> 24239.18s]  Thank you, the power of the rubber bands.
[24243.28s -> 24245.12s]  I'm glad you found them and I'm glad you like them.
[24245.68s -> 24250.06s]  They're a lot of love when it's at those videos.
[24250.94s -> 24255.63s]  So I hold a really deep place in my heart.
[24255.63s -> 24256.35s]  So thank you.
[24257.15s -> 24258.25s]  Glad you enjoy them.
[24263.48s -> 24264.84s]  The gadgets are complete.
[24268.76s -> 24269.88s]  Cry incoming.
[24271.80s -> 24272.36s]  All right.
[24272.36s -> 24273.24s]  Almost done with the car.
[24274.36s -> 24276.36s]  Main base is time.
[24277.00s -> 24278.76s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[24281.64s -> 24282.52s]  J and I.
[24284.81s -> 24287.05s]  I, we need the middle pieces here.
[24291.77s -> 24292.89s]  Incoming cry.
[24297.53s -> 24299.37s]  I'll give all my bits if he cries.
[24300.09s -> 24306.52s]  Why do you want me to cry?
[24306.52s -> 24308.04s]  Oh, when is he gonna cry?
[24309.16s -> 24310.97s]  I'm not going to cry.
[24323.55s -> 24324.51s]  I know it's getting late.
[24325.31s -> 24326.11s]  10, 11, 12.
[24326.11s -> 24327.71s]  It's almost 1 a.m. Eastern.
[24327.71s -> 24328.83s]  I'm sorry it's getting late.
[24329.63s -> 24332.27s]  Let's try to get this done quick.
[24332.99s -> 24334.81s]  Give me the next two hours.
[24346.09s -> 24348.49s]  No cry, no topless, no dick.
[24348.49s -> 24349.37s]  Fails bad man.
[24359.85s -> 24386.00s]  By the way, that is a thousand dollars from Deuce the Gamer.
[24386.00s -> 24386.64s]  Thousand bucks.
[24387.68s -> 24388.48s]  A thousand.
[24389.36s -> 24390.08s]  Not a hundred.
[24391.04s -> 24392.40s]  Not a five hundred.
[24393.04s -> 24393.90s]  A thousand.
[24397.18s -> 24399.82s]  One thousand fucking dollars.
[24409.24s -> 24410.36s]  Fucking grand.
[24410.92s -> 24412.04s]  A grand.
[24415.87s -> 24416.99s]  Deuce the Gamer says,
[24419.21s -> 24421.21s]  Here's a few more to round it out.
[24421.21s -> 24422.09s]  Thanks for everything.
[24422.09s -> 24423.05s]  You're my expensive.
[24427.39s -> 24428.43s]  Holy shit.
[24429.23s -> 24439.79s]  Are you kidding me?
[24442.03s -> 24444.27s]  A thousand fucking dollars.
[24444.91s -> 24446.11s]  A thousand.
[24446.75s -> 24453.98s]  Deuce the Gamer, thank you so much, man.
[24456.32s -> 24458.96s]  Rounding out his one thousand fucking dollars.
[24470.60s -> 24471.32s]  Jesus.
[24472.28s -> 24478.48s]  A hundred thousand fucking bits, man.
[24478.48s -> 24479.60s]  I've never seen that before.
[24480.16s -> 24486.83s]  He already left the chat?
[24496.44s -> 24497.88s]  Jesus Christ.
[24515.66s -> 24517.50s]  I've never seen yellow before.
[24518.14s -> 24520.56s]  For a hundred thousand fucking bits in one day.
[24524.72s -> 24526.08s]  A thousand fucking dollars.
[24528.40s -> 24529.52s]  You up, you paid,
[24529.52s -> 24532.48s]  you alone paid for the fucking green screen stream, dude.
[24533.20s -> 24535.58s]  Honestly, God, that's not even a joke.
[24538.78s -> 24539.66s]  That's gold.
[24552.92s -> 24553.64s]  Deuce, that's...
[24554.60s -> 24557.82s]  Do you think you can buy them?
[24558.54s -> 24561.80s]  Buy like a bed for a thousand dollars.
[24562.68s -> 24565.44s]  That's like a car payment.
[24569.76s -> 24573.92s]  You can buy like so many things at a thousand dollars.
[24573.92s -> 24575.20s]  You can buy like a Vive.
[24584.80s -> 24586.08s]  That's so much money.
[24592.38s -> 24594.06s]  Deuce the Gamer, I'm not sure that
[24595.84s -> 24599.60s]  your amount will ever be fucking surpassed in one day.
[24612.52s -> 24628.99s]  MultiTrip just gave fifty bucks.
[24631.42s -> 24632.46s]  Yeah, Jeremy, you're funny.
[24632.46s -> 24633.18s]  Funny looking.
[24633.82s -> 24636.30s]  As long as it makes me happy, dude.
[24636.30s -> 24639.42s]  I'm fucking glad to take your fifty fucking dollars.
[24641.55s -> 24642.11s]  Jesus.
[24642.99s -> 24644.64s]  Thank you, MultiTrip.
[24645.76s -> 24660.54s]  Waiting for the cry.
[24660.54s -> 24662.19s]  I'm not gonna...
[24662.83s -> 24664.06s]  I'm just...
[24664.06s -> 24669.36s]  I'm just happy and kind of floored.
[24670.08s -> 24679.90s]  There's people in this world that deem this stream worth a thousand dollars.
[24680.46s -> 24685.92s]  I'm speeding off into the fucking sunset.
[24691.23s -> 24692.59s]  I'm gonna fold this down.
[24694.80s -> 24695.04s]  In.
[24698.19s -> 24700.99s]  He's challenging his audience to beat a thousand dollars.
[24700.99s -> 24703.07s]  No, God, that's so much money.
[24704.11s -> 24705.79s]  I'm not challenging anybody.
[24708.59s -> 24709.07s]  Show them.
[24709.07s -> 24710.19s]  Show them how cool you are.
[24712.44s -> 24713.32s]  Come on, harder.
[24713.88s -> 24714.28s]  Do it.
[24714.84s -> 24721.71s]  It's done.
[24722.43s -> 24732.33s]  This goes in the front here, right in the front door.
[24735.80s -> 24736.44s]  Right?
[24736.44s -> 24738.19s]  Of course.
[24741.42s -> 24742.70s]  Now we can flip the piece over,
[24742.70s -> 24745.74s]  make sure the lock doesn't fall out of the slot when you do.
[24745.74s -> 24746.38s]  I did.
[24746.94s -> 24762.51s]  As this piece folds together, I fall asleep on stream.
[24763.48s -> 24765.32s]  God, I'm gonna probably die.
[24767.42s -> 24779.77s]  So this needs to go up here.
[24782.83s -> 24784.35s]  I can still hear that car.
[24785.95s -> 24786.83s]  Yeah, me too.
[24786.83s -> 24788.03s]  I can still hear the car too.
[24789.52s -> 24789.92s]  I don't know.
[24789.92s -> 24791.12s]  I don't know what he's doing.
[24791.12s -> 24792.56s]  He's just like speeding around.
[24793.36s -> 24794.40s]  I'm a psycho.
[24794.40s -> 24795.04s]  What do you have to be?
[24795.84s -> 24801.23s]  Okay.
[24801.23s -> 24802.83s]  Does it match?
[24804.73s -> 24805.93s]  One piece from sheet.
[24805.93s -> 24812.09s]  I got it.
[24812.09s -> 24822.36s]  Throw it all up.
[24839.68s -> 24843.52s]  If everyone donates 50 bits, we can surpass the record.
[24846.12s -> 24847.08s]  My Lord.
[24848.88s -> 24849.52s]  I'm impressed.
[24849.52s -> 24850.32s]  Yes, I am.
[24850.32s -> 24852.32s]  I'm in Pacific Standard Time.
[24852.88s -> 24856.81s]  All right.
[24856.81s -> 24872.46s]  So this comes across here, here, that, there.
[24873.26s -> 24875.61s]  Should be good to go.
[24876.33s -> 24882.99s]  Lay the triangle flat once it's connected.
[24885.02s -> 24886.62s]  And then bring this up.
[24890.49s -> 24891.45s]  Fold it down.
[24891.45s -> 24892.41s]  Fold this down.
[24894.96s -> 24895.60s]  And in.
[24898.57s -> 24899.93s]  Inside.
[24904.51s -> 24905.15s]  Looks good.
[24910.81s -> 24911.77s]  The other piece.
[24916.62s -> 24917.10s]  Sorry.
[24917.10s -> 24918.30s]  I feel like even 50 bits.
[24919.18s -> 24926.44s]  You guys are too much for me, man.
[24927.16s -> 24932.08s]  I gave mine really early.
[24932.08s -> 24934.40s]  I think I'm going to go make like a tuna fucking sandwich.
[24935.20s -> 24938.65s]  Like a tuna tortilla.
[24939.37s -> 24943.34s]  Let's get those bits.
[24948.91s -> 24949.31s]  You know what?
[24949.31s -> 24949.95s]  Tuna what?
[24954.81s -> 24955.53s]  I didn't fold it.
[24955.53s -> 24956.01s]  That's okay.
[24959.79s -> 24961.79s]  So this goes in here.
[24962.51s -> 24965.18s]  Just like that.
[24967.98s -> 24969.74s]  Ah, you fucking idiot.
[24989.53s -> 24995.26s]  Uh, Amnestic OW gave 20 subs.
[24996.80s -> 24998.16s]  Oh, we got another one.
[24998.16s -> 24999.28s]  Amnestic OW.
[25004.14s -> 25005.66s]  Amnestic Overwatch.
[25006.80s -> 25008.64s]  Amnestic OWO.
[25011.29s -> 25013.05s]  Made me 20 fucking community subs.
[25013.61s -> 25014.01s]  Jesus.
[25014.65s -> 25015.13s]  Criminic.
[25018.57s -> 25019.29s]  Turn it around.
[25022.09s -> 25022.89s]  Thank you, Amnestic.
[25023.53s -> 25025.93s]  For your huge fucking contribution.
[25025.93s -> 25026.57s]  My God.
[25027.37s -> 25029.63s]  How many more for new emotes?
[25030.76s -> 25034.04s]  Um, oh my God.
[25049.53s -> 25050.57s]  Five, four, three, two.
[25051.21s -> 25054.25s]  There were like 500 subs.
[25057.61s -> 25060.80s]  Five tonight.
[25060.80s -> 25063.84s]  Just tonight.
[25079.05s -> 25079.61s]  My God.
[25086.94s -> 25087.98s]  What the fuck?
[25090.54s -> 25092.86s]  I'm going to get a tuna sandwich, man.
[25092.86s -> 25094.70s]  I'm going to go eat some tuna fish.
[25094.70s -> 25096.38s]  Kyra Toby just gave a hundred dollars.
[25097.34s -> 25099.42s]  Kyra Toby has given two hundred dollars tonight.
[25100.14s -> 25101.50s]  How high can we go?
[25102.30s -> 25103.10s]  That's not up to me.
[25103.66s -> 25106.46s]  I thank you for the fucking hundred bucks.
[25106.46s -> 25107.74s]  I'm going to go get a tuna sandwich.
[25108.54s -> 25109.44s]  I'll be right back.
[25111.20s -> 25115.72s]  Thank you for the fucking hundred bucks, Kyra Toby.
[25120.96s -> 25121.60s]  I'll be right back.
[25122.24s -> 25123.28s]  I need some tuna fish.
[25125.56s -> 25126.60s]  Oh my God.
[25128.56s -> 25131.20s]  20 subs from Amnestic and a hundred dollars.
[25131.68s -> 25135.44s]  I don't know what to do because I eat tuna fish.
[25136.00s -> 25138.72s]  I'll see you guys in five minutes.
[25138.72s -> 25176.38s]  Not even.
[25321.10s -> 25358.12s]  All right.
[25358.12s -> 25358.44s]  I'm good.
[25370.32s -> 25372.28s]  Okay.
[25372.28s -> 25379.92s]  Okay.
[25379.92s -> 25380.96s]  He was crying.
[25413.64s -> 25414.36s]  I can't.
[25414.36s -> 25422.04s]  How did the tears in your sandwich taste?
[25425.63s -> 25426.35s]  Moisture.
[25426.35s -> 25431.37s]  That's a tortilla.
[25431.37s -> 25431.85s]  Yeah, it is.
[25431.85s -> 25435.63s]  It's a corn tortilla because I'm trying not to eat bread
[25436.35s -> 25440.43s]  because every time I eat bread for some reason, I feel like shit.
[25442.99s -> 25443.55s]  I don't know.
[25443.55s -> 25444.43s]  The base is complete.
[25444.43s -> 25444.67s]  Okay.
[25444.67s -> 25445.07s]  That's it.
[25450.49s -> 25451.93s]  Last four pieces from I.
[25458.81s -> 25460.25s]  Turning into an old fucking man.
[25462.65s -> 25463.53s]  I am.
[25463.53s -> 25464.01s]  You're right.
[25464.57s -> 25472.51s]  Okay.
[25475.84s -> 25476.96s]  Seven fucking hours.
[25476.96s -> 25477.76s]  Holy shit.
[25489.24s -> 25490.52s]  Your dad's gluten intolerant.
[25490.52s -> 25491.88s]  He clipped all wheat and grain.
[25491.88s -> 25492.52s]  He feels great.
[25493.79s -> 25494.11s]  Yeah.
[25494.11s -> 25495.31s]  I mean, that's kind of the idea.
[25496.03s -> 25498.91s]  Seeing how I feel every time I eat bread.
[25498.91s -> 25500.99s]  It just I feel like shit.
[25500.99s -> 25502.99s]  I don't know why I haven't been able to figure it out.
[25504.88s -> 25505.60s]  Where is that?
[25509.44s -> 25509.84s]  Christ.
[25510.64s -> 25512.04s]  Where the fuck is that?
[25515.69s -> 25518.68s]  All right.
[25518.68s -> 25521.00s]  Oh, you're triple spotting the gas and stickers.
[25521.00s -> 25521.80s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25521.80s -> 25525.56s]  So over here, the big one.
[25560.49s -> 25561.77s]  You ate that like a child.
[25576.44s -> 25577.24s]  Right here.
[25577.24s -> 25592.65s]  All the way around.
[25592.65s -> 25593.77s]  Beautiful.
[25593.77s -> 25595.32s]  Looks good.
[25605.07s -> 25608.35s]  Same thing with the more than once, apparently.
[25615.36s -> 25616.32s]  No cry.
[25616.32s -> 25617.20s]  No topless.
[25617.84s -> 25618.96s]  I ain't getting topless.
[25618.96s -> 25631.77s]  I'll tell you that you already.
[25631.77s -> 25632.81s]  Oh, my goodness.
[25640.04s -> 25642.04s]  A wizard just gave a hundred fucking dollars here.
[25649.15s -> 25652.27s]  Hundred fucking bucks from a wizard.
[25654.68s -> 25657.72s]  Jerma, you congratulations on being the best streamer on Twitch
[25657.72s -> 25659.56s]  and building such a fantastic fan base.
[25660.92s -> 25664.28s]  You demonstrated exceptional creativity and individuality
[25666.17s -> 25670.09s]  in an environment that demands mediocrity and mold fitting creators.
[25673.00s -> 25676.68s]  I consider you a pioneer of new era of comedy and entertainment.
[25676.68s -> 25679.40s]  Here's a dollar for every time you maybe cry laughing
[25680.12s -> 25682.27s]  or help improve a bad day week or month.
[25682.99s -> 25689.13s]  Thank you.
[25691.26s -> 25691.82s]  A wizard.
[25693.79s -> 25695.95s]  Master of comedies channel is a different channel,
[25695.95s -> 25698.03s]  but I will gladly take his reign.
[25699.45s -> 25700.25s]  Thank you so much.
[25704.04s -> 25705.85s]  That means a fucking lot.
[25705.85s -> 25706.17s]  Thank you.
[25706.89s -> 25709.21s]  For the one hundred dollars.
[25709.77s -> 25715.87s]  I wonder if I'm gonna have to do this to all four of them.
[25721.18s -> 25722.84s]  Somebody give a thousand dollars?
[25722.84s -> 25723.40s]  Yeah, they did.
[25724.96s -> 25727.60s]  Yeah, they gave a thousand fucking dollars earlier.
[25729.08s -> 25729.72s]  Yes, they did.
[25732.04s -> 25736.04s]  Oh, boy, it was a fucking insane amount of money.
[25737.53s -> 25738.97s]  Cry so I can leave.
[25739.69s -> 25743.64s]  I'm gonna cry.
[25743.64s -> 25745.88s]  I got a little choked.
[25745.96s -> 25755.26s]  But I cry.
[25755.26s -> 25756.38s]  You almost did.
[25756.38s -> 25757.82s]  I got a little choked.
[25759.23s -> 25760.59s]  I got a little choked.
[25761.15s -> 25762.51s]  I didn't cry.
[25767.02s -> 25768.62s]  Cry so I can croak.
[25769.66s -> 25771.58s]  Fuck.
[25771.58s -> 25775.24s]  What are you talking?
[25780.49s -> 25782.09s]  Cry so I can croak.
[25785.76s -> 25788.40s]  I forgot to sleep last night, so it's late.
[25789.29s -> 25791.85s]  It's one plus in the morning.
[25791.85s -> 25792.97s]  Easter night, I understand.
[25793.77s -> 25794.57s]  Have a great night.
[25795.13s -> 25796.49s]  Thanks for sticking around as long as you did.
[25802.72s -> 25804.32s]  Don't need this with a fucking cat.
[25807.07s -> 25807.57s]  Yeah.
[25808.99s -> 25809.49s]  All right.
[25813.00s -> 25813.72s]  Attach the...
[25813.72s -> 25814.92s]  These long tabs should feed by...
[25817.60s -> 25818.10s]  Okay.
[25821.42s -> 25825.10s]  Like this.
[25826.75s -> 25828.83s]  Okay, get the fuck away from me.
[25829.63s -> 25831.92s]  Pull the tabs up.
[25835.71s -> 25837.07s]  Little circles in the way.
[25837.07s -> 25838.51s]  They're staying there for good.
[25839.39s -> 25846.22s]  This is where the...
[25846.22s -> 25847.02s]  I'm gonna puke.
[25847.02s -> 25848.14s]  This is where the switch goes.
[25850.62s -> 25851.34s]  Okay.
[25851.34s -> 25854.06s]  Okay, good.
[25854.78s -> 25881.39s]  At least we'll see him puke.
[25883.31s -> 25885.07s]  That was a joke also.
[25885.07s -> 25886.11s]  I'm not going to puke.
[25886.91s -> 25889.44s]  Although I did just eat...
[25889.44s -> 25892.24s]  I did just drink like half a fucking box of wine
[25893.04s -> 25894.24s]  and eat tuna fish.
[25894.24s -> 25894.74s]  So...
[25896.51s -> 25898.19s]  All bets are off at this point.
[25898.91s -> 25907.33s]  Okay.
[25911.47s -> 25912.03s]  That is a...
[25912.03s -> 25913.95s]  That is such a puke combo.
[25913.95s -> 25914.45s]  You're right.
[25916.88s -> 25919.20s]  That is the ultimate puke combo.
[25921.47s -> 25923.23s]  Oh, I drank a bunch of wine.
[25923.23s -> 25925.39s]  Hey, and a tuna fish in the fridge.
[25926.11s -> 25928.35s]  Let me eat as much as I possibly can.
[25947.15s -> 25947.65s]  Good.
[25948.43s -> 25951.39s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[25952.91s -> 25957.82s]  Looking good.
[25957.82s -> 25958.86s]  What? Eat ice cream?
[25958.86s -> 25960.30s]  Why would I eat ice cream?
[25960.30s -> 25961.64s]  All right, we're done.
[25961.64s -> 25962.60s]  We are almost done.
[25963.48s -> 25971.64s]  How did I make this?
[25971.64s -> 25979.71s]  Something fell off.
[26027.32s -> 26027.82s]  In.
[26027.82s -> 26035.82s]  These two side tabs...
[26035.82s -> 26037.10s]  The bottom should be sticking on.
[26037.74s -> 26039.05s]  Are they gonna look okay?
[26042.25s -> 26042.81s]  Yeah.
[26042.81s -> 26051.15s]  The whole thing over.
[26052.60s -> 26053.24s]  Like this.
[26054.44s -> 26055.84s]  And it falls down.
[26056.48s -> 26060.99s]  And stick the side tabs into here.
[26074.96s -> 26075.46s]  Shit.
[26075.84s -> 26082.56s]  Okay, that's in.
[26083.28s -> 26091.47s]  That's in too.
[26092.03s -> 26098.25s]  So it goes all the way in, right?
[26098.25s -> 26099.93s]  And then it comes around the sides
[26099.93s -> 26101.13s]  and goes into the holes, okay?
[26103.93s -> 26113.87s]  Got it.
[26113.87s -> 26120.72s]  And then like that.
[26120.72s -> 26124.11s]  The Toy-Con car's body is complete.
[26128.70s -> 26129.20s]  The f...
[26129.50s -> 26132.03s]  This is it.
[26132.57s -> 26135.98s]  This is the end.
[26135.98s -> 26139.34s]  We made it.
[26139.96s -> 26146.40s]  We did it.
[26147.02s -> 26148.40s]  Boys and girls.
[26148.40s -> 26167.07s]  Looks good.
[26167.07s -> 26180.30s]  All right.
[26180.38s -> 26181.26s]  Bring the wheel in.
[26182.44s -> 26183.80s]  Lower from above.
[26183.80s -> 26186.72s]  Okay.
[26186.72s -> 26187.58s]  Get it.
[26187.58s -> 26188.38s]  Correct.
[26188.38s -> 26198.40s]  Line up R and L.
[26200.09s -> 26200.81s]  That's correct.
[26200.81s -> 26201.45s]  Right here.
[26201.45s -> 26280.75s]  Nav it in, right?
[26280.75s -> 26292.14s]  Okay, that's up all the way.
[26292.14s -> 26302.27s]  I'm so good at this.
[26302.27s -> 26303.87s]  Looks good.
[26303.87s -> 26317.23s]  Add the Joy-Con.
[26317.23s -> 26318.27s]  Get the key.
[26318.27s -> 26320.89s]  We're done.
[26320.89s -> 26340.24s]  It's done.
[26340.24s -> 26344.19s]  Done.
[26344.19s -> 26346.83s]  Well, I made a baby car wheel.
[26346.83s -> 26352.59s]  This goes like this straight in.
[26352.59s -> 26360.59s]  What an emotional moment.
[26360.59s -> 26361.85s]  Done.
[26361.85s -> 26362.65s]  I can do that too.
[26380.88s -> 26382.92s]  It works.
[26382.92s -> 26384.52s]  Next up, let's prepare the pedal.
[26386.19s -> 26387.63s]  I got that right here.
[26387.63s -> 26418.06s]  All right.
[26418.06s -> 26419.18s]  You can see, right?
[26419.18s -> 26424.17s]  It's already in.
[26424.17s -> 26437.48s]  Size 8.
[26437.48s -> 26440.52s]  I'd recommend using the TV for your first outing in the car.
[26440.52s -> 26441.48s]  Are you ready to play?
[26441.48s -> 26441.96s]  I'm...
[26441.96s -> 26442.52s]  It's done.
[26442.52s -> 26447.02s]  I did it.
[26447.02s -> 26448.62s]  50 bucks from Golden Cricket.
[26449.82s -> 26453.82s]  I was bludgeoning the beef stick earlier and I heard you choked up a bit.
[26453.82s -> 26454.78s]  I didn't...
[26454.78s -> 26455.50s]  So here you go.
[26455.50s -> 26455.98s]  Did you talk...
[26455.98s -> 26456.22s]  Wait.
[26456.22s -> 26456.86s]  What are you talking about?
[26460.22s -> 26462.33s]  All right.
[26462.33s -> 26463.45s]  I got my pedal.
[26463.45s -> 26464.17s]  It's right here.
[26464.97s -> 26466.01s]  Oh, I'm fucking ready.
[26466.01s -> 26466.73s]  Put the key in.
[26468.78s -> 26470.78s]  Thank you Golden Cricket for your 50 bucks.
[26471.66s -> 26472.46s]  Let's go.
[26472.46s -> 26473.02s]  Key is in.
[26473.58s -> 26475.02s]  I'm ready to fucking drive a car.
[26480.97s -> 26482.65s]  This is what you came here for.
[26490.36s -> 26493.08s]  Head to the nearby fuel station and fill your tank.
[26509.04s -> 26509.76s]  Gas station.
[26509.76s -> 26510.32s]  Here it comes.
[26511.37s -> 26513.13s]  Open world adventure game.
[26516.28s -> 26516.84s]  How do you...
[26516.84s -> 26517.72s]  I don't have a brake.
[26518.44s -> 26525.93s]  I don't have brake.
[26525.93s -> 26526.73s]  There's no brake.
[26543.55s -> 26544.99s]  Hold on the reverse lever.
[26545.63s -> 26548.00s]  What's the reverse lever?
[26548.00s -> 26548.32s]  This?
[26549.64s -> 26551.08s]  Oh, shit.
[26552.04s -> 26564.86s]  One of the side levers you can use the hose to fuel up.
[26565.66s -> 26602.59s]  Got it.
[26602.59s -> 26603.31s]  Got it.
[26603.31s -> 26611.50s]  Make the game huge.
[26612.62s -> 26623.64s]  Wait, you can't see the wheel.
[26625.18s -> 26625.90s]  There.
[26625.90s -> 26637.80s]  Fill the tank up.
[26638.44s -> 26644.94s]  Get rid of face cam.
[26645.82s -> 26646.62s]  Okay.
[26646.62s -> 26657.16s]  Okay, here we go.
[26657.96s -> 26659.58s]  Now what?
[26660.22s -> 26669.58s]  Build a car wash.
[26669.58s -> 26671.50s]  Where do you build a car wash?
[26672.30s -> 26681.64s]  Complete all the missions.
[26682.20s -> 26684.24s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[26706.08s -> 26707.04s]  Get on the road.
[26707.84s -> 26708.80s]  Get on the road.
[26718.54s -> 26721.18s]  Hey, so we made it to the road here.
[26722.06s -> 26722.86s]  Let's get up here.
[26724.30s -> 26726.03s]  Can I help you?
[26726.67s -> 26731.28s]  Can I help you?
[26731.28s -> 26732.00s]  What are you doing?
[26732.80s -> 26741.76s]  Are you going to say something or what?
[26742.84s -> 26744.84s]  Can anybody even see me in here?
[26745.56s -> 26748.04s]  No, I got my camera set up perfectly.
[26753.85s -> 26755.37s]  What the fuck was that?
[26756.33s -> 26776.25s]  Hey, breath of the wild.
[26776.25s -> 26779.56s]  You can go to the hole in one, bro.
[26780.28s -> 26800.12s]  All right, so where do I go from here?
[26801.08s -> 26806.67s]  What does this do?
[26807.23s -> 26810.12s]  Should I go inside?
[26810.12s -> 26811.72s]  Very generous traction.
[26812.60s -> 26814.20s]  Where do I go?
[26814.92s -> 26819.88s]  All right, we're going to go this way.
[26820.68s -> 26830.40s]  There's so much latency.
[26836.03s -> 26839.64s]  Make the game bigger.
[26839.64s -> 26840.52s]  What do you want to do?
[26841.56s -> 26843.53s]  There you go.
[26844.25s -> 26858.60s]  There.
[26859.64s -> 26860.92s]  Are we having fun?
[26860.92s -> 26862.04s]  Are we having fun yet?
[26862.92s -> 26871.15s]  All right, let's go this way.
[26872.59s -> 26873.95s]  Let's explore the open world.
[26874.67s -> 26881.00s]  Okay.
[26882.64s -> 26884.56s]  Desert area 0 of 8.
[26897.61s -> 26898.49s]  This is kind of fun.
[26902.60s -> 26903.72s]  This is kind of fun.
[26914.20s -> 26914.92s]  Pull the lever.
[26917.80s -> 26918.44s]  Tornado.
[26919.16s -> 26920.68s]  Tornado, pub champ.
[26921.24s -> 26922.20s]  Pub champ.
[26932.49s -> 26933.37s]  That's so delayed.
[26937.96s -> 26938.84s]  Find the flag.
[26949.44s -> 26950.72s]  Drive up the pyramid.
[26950.72s -> 26951.20s]  You got it.
[26952.16s -> 26959.47s]  Just don't want to fucking gas.
[26960.91s -> 26961.63s]  Hold the cord.
[26970.64s -> 26971.28s]  Give me the flag.
[26971.28s -> 26971.92s]  Give me the flag.
[26973.53s -> 26974.41s]  I win.
[26975.21s -> 26989.79s]  You got to move.
[26989.79s -> 26991.23s]  Okay, that was fun.
[27003.58s -> 27004.86s]  Go in the pyramid.
[27023.64s -> 27024.28s]  Inside.
[27024.28s -> 27024.76s]  There it is.
[27028.22s -> 27029.26s]  Oh, I broke it.
[27029.26s -> 27030.14s]  Did I break it?
[27030.14s -> 27030.70s]  No, it's fine.
[27039.64s -> 27041.32s]  Get in the pyramid, please.
[27042.20s -> 27048.32s]  Oh, there's a fucking boulder in the way.
[27057.08s -> 27058.04s]  Holy shit.
[27058.60s -> 27065.88s]  I just got a treasure chest.
[27066.60s -> 27071.10s]  We're an official treasure hunter now.
[27071.90s -> 27078.86s]  So where do I go from here?
[27079.66s -> 27089.68s]  Why has it stopped going so fast?
[27093.29s -> 27093.61s]  Okay.
[27110.57s -> 27114.19s]  Gas.
[27114.19s -> 27115.15s]  We did it.
[27115.15s -> 27127.36s]  I've been holding the wheelie for at least 60 seconds.
[27129.56s -> 27130.52s]  Oh, dice.
[27131.24s -> 27134.41s]  Try to roll die until it adds up to 10.
[27135.21s -> 27146.06s]  That's 6, 12.
[27146.06s -> 27146.94s]  That's not right.
[27147.82s -> 27152.36s]  That's 6, 12.
[27152.36s -> 27153.24s]  That's not correct.
[27154.04s -> 27165.63s]  Ay, yi, yi.
[27165.63s -> 27166.27s]  Gas.
[27166.83s -> 27172.01s]  I need another...
[27181.90s -> 27182.94s]  Jesus Christ.
[27194.96s -> 27195.44s]  What is it?
[27198.32s -> 27200.56s]  6, 5, 6, 7.
[27203.40s -> 27209.18s]  6, 5, I need a 3.
[27210.22s -> 27212.92s]  3, please.
[27212.92s -> 27213.24s]  Come on.
[27217.07s -> 27218.59s]  6, 7.
[27220.81s -> 27222.41s]  6, 7.
[27235.15s -> 27235.95s]  A 10 for ever?
[27235.95s -> 27236.67s]  A 10 for style?
[27236.67s -> 27304.79s]  Chop down five palm trees. Let's give it a go. One. I wish there was a weight. What?
[27304.79s -> 27339.78s]  Climb the snowy mountain? You got it. Let's go. Listen to that. Listen to that.
[27339.78s -> 27368.32s]  Let's get up there, come on. Come on, get up there. Break it. Give me the flag.
[27368.32s -> 27376.81s]  Get the flag in the mountain area. There's one more thing up here. What is it?
[27376.81s -> 27415.47s]  How many lilies do I have? What's this? Oh, there's a little place to go.
[27415.47s -> 27457.41s]  Oh my god. Smash it. I'm not gonna smash it. The pedal is giving me some resistance now though.
[27457.41s -> 27487.75s]  Did I fuck it up? I think it's okay. It didn't do anything. Does it know that I don't have a foot on it?
[27487.75s -> 27498.22s]  What? Apparently. Alright, as fast as I fucking can go downhill, go.
[27498.22s -> 27534.51s]  Dropping on two wheels. Turn signal. Oh, you're dead.
[27534.51s -> 27548.91s]  I'm almost there. This looks kind of fun, not gonna lie. Actually, it's kind of fun. Out of fuel.
[27548.91s -> 27573.27s]  Oh. There's now something called car. Introducing the car.
[27573.27s -> 27601.58s]  Hey Jeremy. Have you tried?
[27601.58s -> 27607.16s]  This thing is really nice looking though. He's skipping the lower. Yes, I am.
[27607.16s -> 27630.44s]  Take a test. Oh, it's like 2 a.m. Eastern. Jesus.
[27630.44s -> 27637.50s]  There's still like 24, 2,500 people still here. Thanks for staying up with me, guys.
[27637.50s -> 27655.29s]  We get it. We made it. I'm here Mr. Receiving. Tell me a little bullshit, please.
[27655.29s -> 27683.94s]  Now break it. I can't move. How do I like, how do I go back? Get this fucking key out of here.
[27683.94s -> 27694.60s]  First of all, I got the key. We're not going anywhere.
[27694.60s -> 27714.05s]  Change vehicle. The submarine and the plane. I didn't make those yet though, dude.
[27714.05s -> 27729.20s]  I don't have the submarine. It's like four more hours from now.
[27729.20s -> 27738.86s]  I can't, are they talking? Because I can't hear them.
[27738.86s -> 27763.26s]  DLC. All right. Bye. Oh, we don't have the submarine at all.
[27763.26s -> 27775.48s]  60 to 120 minutes. Four hours. I don't think I can make it.
[27775.48s -> 27782.71s]  Yeah. It's like, it's been eight hours. I need to get more food.
[27782.71s -> 27794.20s]  I knew he was a liar. Get some sleep. Yeah, I think it's time for bed.
[27794.20s -> 27803.82s]  I'm going to wind down. I will finish the labo. Probably never.
[27803.82s -> 27812.60s]  Oh, be careful. No wine on the table. Oh, that's good.
[27812.60s -> 27816.04s]  I'm going to put this on my shelf back here. Got it.
[27816.04s -> 27824.91s]  Don't, I'm not going to, this is, this is like actually nice.
[27824.91s -> 27828.91s]  This is a very nice looking piece of equipment. I'm not going to break it.
[27828.91s -> 27833.91s]  Plus you can use this as Mario Kart. I will school so many noobs.
[27833.91s -> 27847.76s]  I'm going to use this as Mario Kart 8. Anyways, that's it.
[27847.76s -> 27856.43s]  There was an absurd amount of support tonight. Thank you everybody.
[27856.43s -> 27861.97s]  Let's get this turned on. Let's move this out of the way.
[27861.97s -> 27868.62s]  Oh, move the pedal, move the car, move this shit out of the way.
[27868.62s -> 27873.52s]  You guys are un fucking believable.
[27873.52s -> 27876.89s]  When the credits roll, there's going to be hundreds of fucking names.
[27876.89s -> 27881.13s]  I'll never be able to keep up. I'm breaking things as I move.
[27881.13s -> 27890.94s]  Come on, man. Okay. Let's do the bits.
[27890.94s -> 27904.63s]  Let's go back before here. Back to, oh, why the, this is fucked up.
[27904.63s -> 27915.87s]  Well, my bit readings are screwed up. I need that website because this shit is fucked up.
[27915.87s -> 27922.03s]  No, never mind. I got it. I got it.
[27922.03s -> 27939.37s]  So let's go back here to quite a while ago.
[27939.37s -> 27946.06s]  This is seven hours ago now. Damn. That's a long fucking time ago.
[27946.06s -> 27954.36s]  Thank you too. By the way, if you take it off, I know it's late.
[27954.36s -> 27959.36s]  See you soon. I will see you guys on tomorrow, Sunday, Monday.
[27959.36s -> 27961.79s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[27961.79s -> 27964.79s]  Tuesday, we will talk more about the green screen.
[27964.79s -> 27966.79s]  There's a lot to talk about.
[27966.79s -> 27974.24s]  I will give the poll on Tuesday because that's pretty much what a majority of the stream will be discussed on.
[27974.24s -> 27981.53s]  So let's get this labo shit out of here and let's go with an outro. There we go.
[27981.53s -> 28000.17s]  So, uh, seven hours ago, we had tons of gifted subs and we also had bits from, let me move this out of the way so I can get closer here.
[28000.17s -> 28008.88s]  Decozerski for the one dollar. Chat cast a dud. All of the money is fake. Thank you.
[28008.88s -> 28016.18s]  Pocket Pauling gave an absolute fucking shitload of money.
[28016.18s -> 28022.43s]  They gave so much fucking money tonight. I can't even comprehend.
[28022.43s -> 28032.72s]  Rentacat gave five dollars. They said sorry. I'm not sure why you're apologizing, but thank you, Rentacat.
[28033.72s -> 28043.10s]  Derek, thank you. DerekX3 for the five dollars. Sorry. I don't know why people are apologizing.

[28106.88s -> 28113.52s]  Abserviday, thank you Abserviday for the money.
[28113.52s -> 28120.80s]  If you don't let this pocket-palling person name your first child by now, I don't know what to think.
[28120.80s -> 28123.74s]  I hope you name it Greg.

[28134.07s -> 28137.46s]  Thank you Spegar for the two bucks.
[28137.46s -> 28141.72s]  Germo cries on stream. Let me say, I didn't cry.
[28141.72s -> 28146.95s]  And I'm so glad we finally get to see it on stream.
[28146.95s -> 28149.95s]  You know what I mean? Fucking Minecraft is so...
[28149.95s -> 28151.95s]  It's a revolutionary game.
[28151.95s -> 28153.95s]  Ayayay.
[28153.95s -> 28158.02s]  Minecraft, what a revolutionary video game.
[28158.02s -> 28160.02s]  Fucking Minecraft.
[28160.02s -> 28166.36s]  Oh my...
[28166.36s -> 28174.93s]  Oh god.

[28204.01s -> 28209.30s]  I think this is a pretty great community.
[28209.30s -> 28215.42s]  I think we're pretty open and accepting to anyone.
[28215.42s -> 28219.35s]  Anyone. So. At least I think that way.
[28219.35s -> 28223.65s]  We can be a little fucking goofy. We can talk a little shit. But you know.
[28223.65s -> 28230.59s]  It's only good fun. But thank you Mad 47.
[28230.59s -> 28234.59s]  Thank you to Silker. SilkerGN for the one dollar.
[28234.59s -> 28240.36s]  Hey Germo95, would you join my Minecraft server on the Switch?
[28240.36s -> 28243.63s]  I made the game by the way.
[28243.63s -> 28249.04s]  I don't play Minecraft. It's a revolutionary game but I don't play it. Thank you.
[28249.04s -> 28254.82s]  PugNinja thanks for the one dollar. Love you Germo. Keep up the good.
[28254.82s -> 28258.68s]  I said goofs. I said goofs.
[28258.68s -> 28263.51s]  Keep up the goofs. I will try.
[28263.51s -> 28268.08s]  Thank you PugNinja for the one dollar.
[28268.08s -> 28274.08s]  David Cage official Twitch. Got a feeling that's not the real official David Cage on Twitch.

[28278.32s -> 28283.32s]  Hey Germo missed you while you were gone. Ever plan on playing Fallout 76 or maybe RimWorld?
[28283.32s -> 28286.84s]  Any who have a nice night.
[28286.84s -> 28293.72s]  Fallout 76 I might play. Just to fuck around for a little while.
[28293.72s -> 28303.19s]  I can't imagine I'll put that much time into Fallout 76 but maybe. We'll see.
[28303.19s -> 28308.56s]  And RimWorld maybe I'll ask Italics for some info. On some fun things to do.
[28308.56s -> 28314.42s]  Fallout 76 is trash. Yeah but it's alright.
[28314.42s -> 28327.95s]  Rick and Morty already played it.
[28327.95s -> 28329.95s]  Thank you Carrot7 for the one dollar.
[28329.95s -> 28337.94s]  I'm a university student so I don't have much time to spare but there's not a chance that I'm going to miss out on the money train.
[28337.94s -> 28342.12s]  Keep being you Germo. You're an inspiration.
[28342.12s -> 28346.36s]  Thank you all as well for inspiring me.

[28352.44s -> 28354.44s]  Thank you Jake Sunshine for the one dollar.
[28354.44s -> 28360.44s]  Germo is one of the only tubers I've been able to watch for years that hasn't said something racist.
[28360.44s -> 28366.74s]  Why would I do that? What the fuck would I do that for?
[28366.74s -> 28373.87s]  Thank you Jake Sunshine. Thanks for the one dollar.
[28373.87s -> 28380.36s]  Thank you Ixion Games for the dollar 80 turning 25. I need to hear that.
[28380.36s -> 28390.15s]  Talking about being 33. It's an age. You get older.
[28390.15s -> 28395.63s]  You'll figure it out. But thank you Ixion Games for the two dollars nearly.
[28395.63s -> 28399.63s]  Cal Darby thanks for the one dollar. I tried stretching and accidentally broke my mum's neck.
[28399.63s -> 28402.63s]  We've read that one already but that got me already.
[28402.63s -> 28408.34s]  Thank you Zan Man for the one dollar.
[28408.34s -> 28414.34s]  My 20th birthday is on the 12th and it would mean the world to me if you wished me a happy birthday.
[28414.34s -> 28418.58s]  I've been watching your stuff for years and I wish I could afford to give you more.
[28418.58s -> 28426.72s]  Happy birthday Zan Man. 1998. Have a great one on the 12th.

[28433.06s -> 28440.13s]  MandragoraRoot thanks for the one dollar.
[28440.13s -> 28445.68s]  It's really cool that you can be the single most funny person on the internet but be super real.
[28445.68s -> 28450.68s]  Thanks for being the one, the only, German 985.
[28450.68s -> 28460.21s]  I only know how to be one person. I don't know how to be anybody else. Thank you.
[28460.21s -> 28464.16s]  Funniest person ever confirmed by the way.
[28464.16s -> 28471.84s]  I'm not sure that that's the case but I'm glad you have fun.
[28471.84s -> 28477.16s]  Darkstar, 700,000 games thanks for the one dollar Darkstar.
[28477.16s -> 28483.98s]  It's funny you should mention getting a haircut. I've recently visited my mother and she and I were going back and forth.
[28483.98s -> 28488.98s]  She said my hair was too long and I was saying I like the length my hair is at.
[28488.98s -> 28491.16s]  Dot dot dot dot.
[28491.16s -> 28494.16s]  And then my mother looked at something off to the distance behind me.
[28494.16s -> 28500.16s]  Remember I'm facing her and she's looking towards me and she opens her mouth slowly and says oh my god.
[28500.16s -> 28504.78s]  I look behind me and there's this 25 foot spider on the wall.
[28504.78s -> 28511.86s]  Thank you Cal Darby for the one dollar. Fail RP you're ruining my immersion.
[28511.86s -> 28516.25s]  Sorry about that dude. Sorry about that fucking bro.
[28516.25s -> 28520.00s]  Ritter Rittington thanks for the one dollar.

[28525.88s -> 28531.06s]  I just wanted to say that you're a fantastically funny guy and deserve all the damn money coming your way.
[28531.06s -> 28536.78s]  Have a dollar you scruffy hobo. Thank you.
[28536.78s -> 28540.35s]  Thank you Ritter.
[28540.35s -> 28542.65s]  That means a lot.

[28548.13s -> 28551.13s]  Thank you Voyeuristic Vol for the five dollars.
[28551.13s -> 28558.02s]  Some may call me a no life nerd who's never sexually done stuff.
[28558.02s -> 28561.02s]  Jim Davis Garfield before in his entire life.
[28561.02s -> 28566.39s]  What? But as long as I can watch your streams I feel like I can tolerate this state of affairs all the best.
[28566.39s -> 28572.96s]  What are you talking about? What happened?
[28572.96s -> 28574.96s]  Thank you.
[28574.96s -> 28577.96s]  Thank you Paradox Potato for the two dollars.
[28577.96s -> 28583.48s]  If you think you can drive well you can teach Forsen how to drive.
[28583.48s -> 28588.13s]  I don't really give lessons but good luck to you Forsen.
[28588.13s -> 28593.96s]  Hopefully you can figure it out too. It's tough.
[28593.96s -> 28595.96s]  Digit Guy thanks for the two bucks.

[28603.44s -> 28606.93s]  About a half a year ago I started...
[28606.93s -> 28612.49s]  About a half a year ago I started writing Lego Island in chat every stream.
[28612.49s -> 28616.49s]  I watched and brainwashed the community to make you play this masterpiece of a game.
[28616.49s -> 28619.92s]  In the end it didn't work out but thanks for trying.
[28619.92s -> 28630.18s]  The journey was fun but I will now go into Lego Island retirement.
[28630.18s -> 28633.42s]  Thank you Werewed Forty for the two dollars total here.
[28633.42s -> 28635.42s]  What about Lego Island Two?

[28658.36s -> 28661.36s]  I'm sorry I said you took three hours when it was actually two.
[28661.36s -> 28664.36s]  I was watching another stream before so I forgot.
[28664.36s -> 28668.27s]  Please take my money as an apology.
[28668.27s -> 28670.51s]  Apology accepted. Apology accepted.
[28670.51s -> 28674.78s]  Thank you.
[28674.78s -> 28677.78s]  Enraged Grandpa thanks for the five dollars Enraged Grandpa.
[28677.78s -> 28680.21s]  Don't spend it all in one place honey.
[28680.21s -> 28681.77s]  I won't.
[28681.77s -> 28687.14s]  I'll spend two dollars on a coffee, two dollars on a sandwich and one dollar on the casino.
[28687.14s -> 28689.14s]  On the one cent slots.
[28689.14s -> 28691.70s]  Thank you so much man.

[28697.96s -> 28702.04s]  My mother just walked in who knew nothing about Twitch.
[28702.04s -> 28708.04s]  And I had to explain to her that I was watching a 33 year old guy playing with a children's toy while drinking wine.
[28708.04s -> 28720.92s]  Thank you for the ten bucks and hopefully you talked to her about online media.
[28720.92s -> 28723.41s]  Just say online media.
[28723.41s -> 28726.16s]  What are you watching in there Dave?
[28726.16s -> 28729.47s]  I'm watching an online media guy.

[28747.98s -> 28754.46s]  I feel the need to kick some bits towards the money stream.
[28754.46s -> 28759.96s]  You're an amazing entertaining person and you deserve every cent you get.
[28759.96s -> 28762.74s]  Much love.
[28762.74s -> 28764.88s]  That means a lot.
[28764.88s -> 28770.46s]  One dollar or a hundred means a lot that you would even think about it in the first place.
[28770.46s -> 28771.46s]  So thank you so much.
[28771.46s -> 28774.79s]  Thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar.
[28774.79s -> 28784.72s]  You say everyone called you an idiot last stream but here is what actually happened.
[28784.72s -> 28788.72s]  You're all idiots.
[28788.72s -> 28791.60s]  No I'm not saying that.
[28791.60s -> 28798.08s]  I'm saying what somebody said.
[28798.08s -> 28800.08s]  I was saying what somebody said.
[28800.08s -> 28802.08s]  I was quoting what somebody else said.
[28802.08s -> 28803.08s]  I was quoting what somebody else said.
[28803.08s -> 28804.71s]  See?
[28804.71s -> 28805.71s]  Gentlemen.
[28805.71s -> 28807.95s]  Okay.
[28807.95s -> 28812.49s]  I'm glad you left the whole clip.

[28838.51s -> 28840.51s]  I hope these bits find you well.
[28840.51s -> 28844.09s]  I will put them to good use.
[28844.09s -> 28845.40s]  I will try.

[28853.70s -> 28855.70s]  Then he powerbombed me through the sink.
[28855.70s -> 28859.70s]  We already came to the conclusion that WTF mate.
[28859.70s -> 28860.70s]  You know what I mean?
[28860.70s -> 28862.90s]  What the heck was that?
[28862.90s -> 28866.72s]  Thank you Bet3 for your two bucks here.
[28866.72s -> 28868.72s]  Give Otto my regards.

[28905.53s -> 28908.16s]  You truly are an amazing person.
[28908.16s -> 28909.16s]  Raise love.
[28909.16s -> 28911.16s]  Would you mind flexing on Cam?
[28911.16s -> 28913.72s]  We need to see those muscles man.
[28913.72s -> 28915.72s]  No worries though if you don't want to.
[28915.72s -> 28924.25s]  Thank you.
[28924.25s -> 28927.64s]  It's time for Slime.
[28927.64s -> 28930.14s]  Thanks for the two bucks time for Slime.
[28930.14s -> 28934.14s]  I too was inspired to crack some wine during this stream and I'm already a mess.
[28934.14s -> 28937.14s]  I have no idea how you're still as composed as you are.
[28937.14s -> 28941.30s]  Bravo.
[28941.30s -> 28944.95s]  I thought the red chair was your ass.
[28944.95s -> 28946.95s]  No it's...

[28981.06s -> 28983.36s]  Jermbo the smell does in fact exist.
[28983.36s -> 28986.36s]  My dog smells like Fritos in old books.
[28986.36s -> 28990.36s]  But I wouldn't consider it a savory smell.
[28990.36s -> 28997.62s]  Come on buddy we're taking you to rehab.
[28997.62s -> 28999.62s]  You guys know it's a savory...
[28999.62s -> 29000.92s]  Whatever.
[29000.92s -> 29002.92s]  David Cage thanks for the one dollar.
[29002.92s -> 29006.76s]  Why didn't you tell us Otto was ten?
[29006.76s -> 29009.32s]  Jermbo he's going to die.
[29009.32s -> 29010.32s]  Thanks.
[29010.32s -> 29012.32s]  Make me love a dog who would die.
[29012.32s -> 29013.32s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[29013.32s -> 29015.32s]  Otto was like seven.
[29015.32s -> 29016.32s]  What?
[29016.32s -> 29019.59s]  Otto was seven years old.
[29019.59s -> 29020.59s]  He's not ten.
[29020.59s -> 29021.59s]  Where did you get that info from?
[29021.59s -> 29022.59s]  I didn't say that.
[29022.59s -> 29025.08s]  Come on man.
[29025.08s -> 29028.44s]  Come on.
[29028.44s -> 29036.29s]  That's fake.
[29036.29s -> 29038.29s]  Thank you Darkstar again for the one dollar.

[29060.31s -> 29062.31s]  E-Dragon thanks for the 250.
[29062.31s -> 29066.15s]  I really think you should start seeing a therapist.
[29066.15s -> 29070.15s]  These drunk fits of rage are really concerning.
[29070.15s -> 29076.46s]  And I don't think Otto should have to put up with them.
[29076.46s -> 29077.46s]  Otto's downstairs with Kim.
[29077.46s -> 29081.68s]  What are you talking about?

[29091.11s -> 29093.11s]  I didn't fucking prank anybody.
[29093.11s -> 29095.48s]  I walked in his room.
[29095.48s -> 29096.48s]  Please.
[29096.48s -> 29097.48s]  Hey.
[29097.48s -> 29098.48s]  Alright.
[29098.48s -> 29100.48s]  Thank you Apepperoni for the one dollar.
[29100.48s -> 29106.16s]  This stream was a mess and I don't regret at all supporting it.
[29106.16s -> 29109.71s]  Jermamoon.
[29109.71s -> 29110.71s]  I had a lot of fun.
[29110.71s -> 29113.14s]  This was a ton of fun.
[29113.14s -> 29115.14s]  What a great fun time I had.
[29115.14s -> 29116.14s]  I hope you guys had fun too.

[29119.14s -> 29121.14s]  Please make a Jupiter shirt.
[29121.14s -> 29125.14s]  Jupiter will be on the shirt that is being sold around Christmastime this year.
[29125.14s -> 29128.20s]  Along with the Glooman shirt.
[29128.20s -> 29129.20s]  Which will make a return.
[29129.20s -> 29132.27s]  Look for that somewhere in December.
[29132.27s -> 29138.07s]  Thank you Bet3 again for the ten dollars.
[29138.07s -> 29143.25s]  I'm thinking about getting some pet rats.
[29143.25s -> 29145.25s]  What are some good old.
[29145.25s -> 29147.43s]  What are some good names for two rats?
[29147.43s -> 29151.56s]  Wrinkle and Dinkle.
[29151.56s -> 29152.56s]  There you go.
[29152.56s -> 29153.56s]  Wrinkle and Dinkle.
[29153.56s -> 29156.60s]  Those are the two rat names.

[29191.71s -> 29193.14s]  I don't know.
[29193.14s -> 29194.14s]  Asshole.
[29194.14s -> 29201.63s]  Why am I an asshole?

[29407.58s -> 29409.58s]  I mean it's not too bad right.
[29409.58s -> 29412.16s]  Thank you tiny cactus.
[29412.16s -> 29416.52s]  Take a look at the bit leaderboards.
[29416.52s -> 29419.01s]  It's fucking crazy.
[29419.01s -> 29424.71s]  That truly is insane.
[29424.71s -> 29427.28s]  Look at that.
[29427.28s -> 29428.28s]  A thousand three hundred two hundred.
[29428.28s -> 29430.28s]  A hundred hundred hundred hundred.

[29463.98s -> 29464.98s]  Hello everybody.
[29464.98s -> 29465.98s]  Let me introduce myself.
[29465.98s -> 29466.98s]  My name is Jerma.
[29466.98s -> 29468.98s]  I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[29468.98s -> 29470.98s]  Some of you people might already know me from playing in servers.
[29470.98s -> 29473.16s]  But some of you probably don't.
[29473.16s -> 29474.16s]  This is my introduction to you guys.
[29474.16s -> 29476.16s]  I'm going to just do Team Fortress commentaries.
[29476.16s -> 29477.16s]  But I'm going to do other stuff.
[29477.16s -> 29479.16s]  Most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff.
[29479.16s -> 29480.40s]  Because I love the game.
[29480.40s -> 29482.40s]  And it's my absolute favorite game in the world right now.
[29482.40s -> 29483.40s]  It has been...
[29483.40s -> 29486.22s]  What is that?
[29486.22s -> 29487.22s]  That's my first video?
[29487.22s -> 29490.38s]  What does that part mean?
[29490.38s -> 29492.38s]  You might know me from servers.
[29492.38s -> 29496.22s]  Like you might know me from a server.
[29496.22s -> 29498.97s]  Who the fuck was that?
[29498.97s -> 29499.97s]  Who the hell was I talking to?
[29499.97s -> 29517.34s]  That's not my video.
[29517.34s -> 29526.60s]  I didn't make the...
[29526.60s -> 29531.28s]  Did I actually say that in this video?
[29531.28s -> 29532.28s]  I didn't do this.
[29532.28s -> 29533.28s]  This is not me.
[29533.28s -> 29534.28s]  Get it off.
[29539.01s -> 29547.70s]  Hello everybody.
[29547.70s -> 29549.64s]  Introduce myself.
[29549.64s -> 29550.64s]  Right here.
[29550.64s -> 29551.64s]  My name is Jerma.
[29551.64s -> 29554.46s]  I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[29554.46s -> 29557.46s]  Some people might already know me from playing in servers.
[29557.46s -> 29558.46s]  What?
[29558.46s -> 29559.46s]  Some of you probably don't.
[29559.46s -> 29560.46s]  And this is my introduction to you guys.
[29560.46s -> 29562.46s]  What are you talking about?
[29562.46s -> 29564.46s]  I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.
[29564.46s -> 29565.46s]  I'm going to do other stuff.
[29567.46s -> 29568.46s]  Hello everybody.
[29568.46s -> 29570.46s]  Who would know me from servers?
[29570.46s -> 29573.46s]  My name is Jerma.
[29573.46s -> 29575.89s]  I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[29575.89s -> 29578.89s]  Some people might already know me from playing in servers.
[29578.89s -> 29580.89s]  Some of you probably don't.
[29580.89s -> 29582.89s]  And this is my introduction to you guys.
[29582.89s -> 29585.89s]  I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.
[29585.89s -> 29586.89s]  I'm going to do other stuff.
[29586.89s -> 29589.89s]  I'm going to be able to do the Labos drunk on stream.
[29589.89s -> 29592.26s]  But most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff.
[29592.26s -> 29593.26s]  Because I love the game.
[29593.26s -> 29595.26s]  It's my absolute favorite game.
[29595.26s -> 29597.26s]  In the world right now.
[29597.26s -> 29599.26s]  It has been for a while.
[29599.26s -> 29601.26s]  I've been playing Team Fortress since beta.
[29601.26s -> 29602.26s]  How good was I?
[29602.26s -> 29604.26s]  And before that I played Team Fortress Classic.
[29604.26s -> 29605.26s]  How good was I?
[29605.26s -> 29606.26s]  Let's see.
[29613.26s -> 29614.26s]  I still have that problem.
[29631.26s -> 29632.26s]  Three fucking stabs.
[29632.26s -> 29633.26s]  Beautiful.
[29634.26s -> 29635.26s]  Letron J.
[29635.26s -> 29636.26s]  Idiot.
[29644.26s -> 29646.91s]  Getting right to the point.
[29646.91s -> 29647.91s]  I agree.
[29664.91s -> 29678.91s]  This is a big problem.
[29678.91s -> 29682.91s]  Tuber Voice?
[29682.91s -> 29684.91s]  This is me just talking.
[29684.91s -> 29687.91s]  I didn't bring the Tuber Voice out until like a year or two later.
[29695.91s -> 29696.91s]  I don't understand why that happened.
[29696.91s -> 29699.91s]  That there was something going on in the video editing process.
[29699.91s -> 29700.91s]  Kill that Heavy.
[29700.91s -> 29703.91s]  I think that Medic was about to charge an Uber or something.
[29703.91s -> 29705.91s]  But he jumps to his death.
[29705.91s -> 29707.91s]  And I don't know why I did that to tell you the truth.
[29707.91s -> 29709.91s]  He could have just ran backwards.
[29709.91s -> 29711.91s]  So I'm still on fire.
[29711.91s -> 29712.91s]  Let me pick this health kit up again.
[29712.91s -> 29714.91s]  Still on fire.
[29714.91s -> 29716.91s]  I'm not sure if it's bugged like I said.
[29716.91s -> 29718.34s]  I love Dead Ringer.
[29718.34s -> 29719.34s]  I love the Spy.
[29719.34s -> 29720.34s]  It's my most played class.
[29720.34s -> 29721.34s]  It is.
[29721.34s -> 29724.34s]  Next to that I think it's Engineer.
[29724.34s -> 29725.34s]  It is?
[29725.34s -> 29726.34s]  Still.
[29726.34s -> 29728.34s]  It's five years later.
[29738.34s -> 29740.34s]  Well that's 2012.
[29740.34s -> 29742.34s]  Well that's maybe okay.
[29755.34s -> 29757.34s]  This Sniper.
[29757.34s -> 29759.34s]  I get him as well with the Revolver.
[29759.34s -> 29762.34s]  Which this Revolver is hard to kill people with because you have to shoot them.
[29762.34s -> 29767.34s]  I think it's at least three or four times if you have 125 health or 150 health.
[29767.34s -> 29769.34s]  Like some of the classes do.
[29769.34s -> 29771.34s]  But this Scout, I think he's a Spy.
[29771.34s -> 29772.34s]  He thinks I'm a Spy.
[29772.34s -> 29774.34s]  We both go, haha.
[29774.34s -> 29781.79s]  Now watch this part right here.
[29781.79s -> 29782.79s]  I don't understand this part.
[29782.79s -> 29784.79s]  And you'll get a laugh out of this.
[29784.79s -> 29785.79s]  This is a Spy.
[29785.79s -> 29787.79s]  And we both know it.
[29787.79s -> 29790.79s]  But he just keeps on walking.
[29790.79s -> 29794.79s]  Apparently he didn't care that I bumped into him.
[29794.79s -> 29796.79s]  Or that I was a Spy.
[29796.79s -> 29797.79s]  I don't even know.
[29797.79s -> 29798.79s]  I was wrong.
[29798.79s -> 29799.79s]  I'm fucking stupid.
[29799.79s -> 29801.79s]  I was like a child.
[29801.79s -> 29802.79s]  What an idiot.
[29802.79s -> 29804.79s]  I think it was a Bot at first.
[29804.79s -> 29807.79s]  I guess there were a couple Bots on both teams but I still think he was a player.
[29807.79s -> 29810.79s]  I found out that he wasn't.
[29810.79s -> 29813.79s]  So if that was you, shame on you.
[29813.79s -> 29816.79s]  And maybe you'll get better by practicing.
[29817.79s -> 29820.79s]  So right now I'm just kind of trying to lure somebody out here.
[29820.79s -> 29822.79s]  The Soldier, I get him.
[29822.79s -> 29824.79s]  And that's what it's all about with the Spy.
[29824.79s -> 29826.79s]  Just trying to mess with people's heads.
[29826.79s -> 29830.79s]  And as you notice, I walk sideways and I walk backwards a lot.
[29830.79s -> 29835.79s]  Because if you walk right at people, as a lot of you know, you're a definite guaranteed Spy.
[29835.79s -> 29838.79s]  So I'm trying to pretend like this Scout is my enemy.
[29838.79s -> 29841.79s]  And I fool this Spy.
[29841.79s -> 29843.79s]  But it doesn't matter because I miss anyways.
[29843.79s -> 29845.79s]  And nothing happens from it though.
[29845.79s -> 29847.79s]  He didn't really come after me.
[29847.79s -> 29850.79s]  I think that's the same Spy who killed his Engineer.
[29850.79s -> 29851.79s]  I believe that's...
[29851.79s -> 29853.79s]  What was that?
[29853.79s -> 29854.79s]  Beep beep beep?
[29854.79s -> 29856.79s]  What was beep beep beep?
[29856.79s -> 29861.18s]  I think that's the same Spy who killed his Engineer.
[29861.18s -> 29863.18s]  Nothing happens from it though.
[29863.18s -> 29865.18s]  He didn't really come after me.
[29865.18s -> 29868.18s]  I think that's the same Spy who killed his Engineer.
[29868.18s -> 29873.18s]  I believe that's the same Spy that when he heard me on Cloak, he didn't really come after me.
[29873.18s -> 29876.18s]  He just kind of shot in random directions and that was it.
[29876.18s -> 29878.18s]  So I get this Medic and I get the Soldier.
[29878.18s -> 29880.18s]  I have ruined their days.
[29880.18s -> 29884.18s]  And this is, like I said, the last part of...
[29884.18s -> 29889.18s]  Keep in mind, gotta keep in mind, this is seven years ago.
[29889.18s -> 29891.18s]  Gold Rush, I started a little late.
[29891.18s -> 29893.18s]  The first video I've ever made. Ever.
[29893.18s -> 29896.18s]  But it's okay because this is a pretty good run.
[29896.18s -> 29899.18s]  And I'm still on fire.
[29899.18s -> 29902.18s]  Nice little jumping, little side-stab on that Medic.
[29902.18s -> 29907.18s]  And yeah, I had to bring up the Dead Ringer because there's no way I would have survived that at all.
[29907.18s -> 29909.18s]  And you were 25.
[29909.18s -> 29911.18s]  That doesn't, but whatever.
[29911.18s -> 29913.61s]  It doesn't matter how old you are.
[29913.61s -> 29919.61s]  Which is the best part about the Dead Ringer because if you had a regular invisibility watch, half of these situations you'd be dead.
[29919.61s -> 29921.61s]  I'd say probably more than half.
[29921.61s -> 29927.61s]  So I try to tele-frag this Engineer and it doesn't really go so well because he's obviously not in the way.
[29927.61s -> 29931.61s]  He actually hits me with his wrench and he doesn't kill me.
[29931.61s -> 29935.61s]  I think I was over you. I think he critted me, actually, to tell you the truth.
[29935.61s -> 29939.61s]  Somebody wrote, I wasn't even alive seven years ago.
[29939.61s -> 29947.11s]  See, right now I'm in no man's land because there's just so many people around and this Heavy knows it, so I'm gonna go down.
[29947.11s -> 29951.41s]  And everyone doesn't really hear it, but I just kind of freak out.
[29951.41s -> 29954.41s]  There's too many people for me to even really do anything significant.
[29954.41s -> 29957.41s]  But hey, I tried and that's when I died.
[29957.41s -> 29959.78s]  So look, I'm still on fire.
[29959.78s -> 29960.78s]  I can't get over it.
[29960.78s -> 29963.78s]  I'm still on fire. I've yet to be put out.
[29963.78s -> 29966.78s]  And it wasn't like this when I was playing, by the way.
[29966.78s -> 29970.78s]  Only when I saved the video.
[29970.78s -> 29976.96s]  So I guess this is some kind of bug with demo files where it does this.
[29976.96s -> 29980.96s]  And it really is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.
[29980.96s -> 29984.96s]  If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips.
[29984.96s -> 29985.96s]  If you guys do?
[29987.96s -> 29990.58s]  Hold on, I'm asking for tips.
[29990.58s -> 29992.58s]  On how to make commentaries.
[29992.58s -> 29994.58s]  Nobody was doing them.
[29994.58s -> 29997.58s]  There's like nine people making these.
[29997.58s -> 30002.58s]  Where it does this and it really is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.
[30002.58s -> 30010.58s]  If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here.
[30010.58s -> 30016.58s]  There was probably seven other Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentators in 2011.
[30016.58s -> 30020.42s]  Yeah, but not gonna let it ruin my day.
[30020.42s -> 30022.42s]  It actually subsides right here.
[30022.42s -> 30024.42s]  I had to cut.
[30024.42s -> 30026.42s]  I think something crashed.
[30026.42s -> 30028.42s]  But yeah, it's gone now.
[30028.42s -> 30030.42s]  Wait, hold on. What do I have to do?
[30030.42s -> 30032.42s]  I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.
[30032.42s -> 30034.42s]  If you guys can give me some tips.
[30034.42s -> 30037.11s]  I cut because it crashed?
[30037.11s -> 30039.11s]  What exactly could be going on here, I have no idea.
[30039.11s -> 30041.11s]  I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.
[30041.11s -> 30043.11s]  It actually subsides right here.
[30043.11s -> 30045.11s]  I had to cut.
[30045.11s -> 30047.11s]  Why did I cut?
[30047.11s -> 30050.10s]  I think something crashed.
[30050.10s -> 30052.10s]  That's a lie. What do you mean a cut?
[30052.10s -> 30054.53s]  I had to cut.
[30054.53s -> 30058.37s]  Where?
[30058.37s -> 30062.87s]  Do commentaries if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here.
[30062.87s -> 30064.87s]  I have no idea.
[30064.87s -> 30068.00s]  I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.
[30068.00s -> 30070.00s]  It actually subsides right here.
[30070.00s -> 30072.00s]  I had to cut.
[30072.00s -> 30074.00s]  I think something crashed.
[30074.00s -> 30076.00s]  Something crashed?
[30076.00s -> 30078.00s]  Yeah, it's gone now.
[30078.00s -> 30080.00s]  This is still the same life.
[30080.00s -> 30082.00s]  It's still the same life, I guess.
[30082.00s -> 30086.00s]  So I take the hit from the heavy, bring out the dead ringer, go back to the little spot here.
[30086.00s -> 30088.00s]  This is a great place to go.
[30088.00s -> 30090.00s]  If you don't go here, you should go here every time.
[30090.00s -> 30092.00s]  Go there every time.
[30092.00s -> 30094.00s]  But that other soldier is not gonna have any of that.
[30094.00s -> 30098.00s]  If you're using the dead ringer, that's a really good place to go.
[30098.00s -> 30100.00s]  Because nobody...
[30100.00s -> 30102.00s]  You can see my steam overlay.
[30102.00s -> 30106.00s]  Behind all the sound of the deep look of the dead ringer is very silent.
[30106.00s -> 30108.00s]  So where are the last 10 seconds?
[30108.00s -> 30110.00s]  This person is logging into steam.
[30110.00s -> 30116.44s]  We are winning this, and obviously I come out here to demoralize the other team.
[30116.44s -> 30118.80s]  And it was a pretty good run.
[30118.80s -> 30120.80s]  That was pretty good.
[30120.80s -> 30122.80s]  If you did, let me know.
[30122.80s -> 30124.80s]  Look at that, look at that.
[30124.80s -> 30126.98s]  Who's number one right there?
[30126.98s -> 30129.22s]  That's Jerma.
[30129.22s -> 30131.22s]  Give me a comment, let me know if you want to see something else.
[30131.22s -> 30133.22s]  Or if you guys want to see more.
[30133.22s -> 30137.22s]  I plan on doing it at least a little bit to try and, you know, try and get into it.
[30137.22s -> 30139.22s]  But thanks for watching, and hopefully you guys enjoyed.
[30139.22s -> 30141.22s]  I'll see you later.
[30141.22s -> 30143.22s]  That was the first video I've ever made.
[30143.22s -> 30148.34s]  See you all in the next video.
[30148.34s -> 30151.73s]  I don't even know where we were.
[30151.73s -> 30156.47s]  That video sucked.
[30156.47s -> 30159.16s]  How many viewers did Jerma get in his first stream?
[30159.16s -> 30164.87s]  Um, like Twitch or YouTube?
[30164.87s -> 30172.64s]  When I started, I had an established group of people when I first streamed on Twitch.
[30172.64s -> 30177.78s]  I think my first ever stream was a birthday stream.
[30177.78s -> 30182.21s]  It was like 215 people.
[30182.21s -> 30186.21s]  And it was like, holy shit, I have like an audience that's coming over to Twitch!
[30186.21s -> 30188.21s]  I think it was like 207 people.
[30188.21s -> 30190.96s]  And it was a big deal.
[30190.96s -> 30193.40s]  It was.
[30193.40s -> 30195.40s]  It was like a birthday stream.
[30195.40s -> 30198.60s]  That's still really good.
[30198.60s -> 30200.60s]  Yeah, no, it was great.
[30200.60s -> 30205.01s]  200 fucking people are a lot of people.
[30205.01s -> 30212.64s]  So, 2-3, 400 people, like that's what I was starting with.
[30212.64s -> 30214.95s]  That's still a lot of people.
[30214.95s -> 30223.72s]  If you put 200 people in a room, you've got a giant party.
[30223.72s -> 30226.28s]  So, yeah, no.
[30226.28s -> 30228.28s]  It's been great. I love it.
[30228.28s -> 30231.52s]  Let's get back to what we were doing.
[30231.52s -> 30233.52s]  Now I have more than 5 times that.
[30233.52s -> 30235.83s]  I don't look at it that way though.
[30235.83s -> 30243.59s]  200, 5,000, 10,400, doesn't matter.
[30243.59s -> 30246.34s]  I'm gonna still do the things that I'm gonna do.
[30246.34s -> 30255.36s]  But, yeah, whoever linked that, thank you.
[30255.36s -> 30257.36s]  We are getting closer to the end here.
[30257.36s -> 30264.16s]  Thank you so much to Matters of Darkness, 15 bucks.
[30286.55s -> 30292.04s]  Thank you.
[30292.04s -> 30294.04s]  Somebody wrote, Jerma's an inspiration.
[30294.04s -> 30299.36s]  I don't know if you get inspiration from the stuff that I do and the stuff that you see here.
[30299.36s -> 30302.37s]  Good, I'm glad.
[30302.37s -> 30305.00s]  I'm glad you can do something from it.
[30305.00s -> 30307.00s]  Have fun.
[30307.00s -> 30309.00s]  Glad you can make something from it.
[30309.00s -> 30312.07s]  Cry, cry, cry, cry.
[30312.07s -> 30318.47s]  But for real, thank you for the huge amount of money tonight, dude.
[30318.47s -> 30320.47s]  Thank you so much.
[30320.47s -> 30322.71s]  Green Templar, thanks for the 4 dollars.
[30322.71s -> 30324.71s]  No message, thank you.
[30324.71s -> 30326.71s]  Shirt, thanks for the dollar and 10 cents.
[30326.71s -> 30330.68s]  Shirt 113.
[30330.68s -> 30333.43s]  Manfun, thanks for the one dollar.
[30333.43s -> 30335.86s]  Appreciate it.
[30335.86s -> 30339.25s]  SaintMP, thanks for the one dollar.
[30339.25s -> 30342.26s]  Littlesmoop, thanks for the one dollar.
[30342.26s -> 30348.26s]  No messages here, just people kind of throwing money into the pot here and it's very much appreciated.
[30348.26s -> 30351.40s]  Thank you, guys.
[30351.40s -> 30353.40s]  Butterderp, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[30353.40s -> 30355.40s]  Jeremy, I don't leave your stream saying that was fun.
[30355.40s -> 30357.40s]  I leave your stream saying no, please don't leave.
[30357.40s -> 30359.70s]  We touched upon this earlier.
[30359.70s -> 30362.84s]  But again, Butterderp, thank you so much.
[30362.84s -> 30366.80s]  I'm glad you can have a good fucking time.
[30368.80s -> 30375.20s]  AmnesiaStreamer.
[30383.00s -> 30385.00s]  Should have recommended that I cry on the green screen.
[30385.00s -> 30388.13s]  I probably will.
[30388.13s -> 30390.44s]  Jerma, are you a US citizen?
[30390.44s -> 30392.74s]  Yeah, yes.
[30392.74s -> 30394.74s]  I think, I think so.
[30394.74s -> 30400.76s]  Thank you, though.
[30400.76s -> 30405.88s]  Thank you to Koalav3Jance.
[30405.88s -> 30411.46s]  KoalavGance.
[30411.46s -> 30413.46s]  I'm saying your name so wrong, I'm sorry, but thank you.
[30413.46s -> 30416.28s]  Thanks for the bits there, dude.
[30416.28s -> 30418.28s]  Thank you, DeuceTheGamer.
[30418.28s -> 30420.84s]  Again, we gotta touch upon this.
[30420.84s -> 30424.84s]  This is the most amount of money that anyone has ever given me during one stream.
[30424.84s -> 30427.78s]  A thousand fucking dollars.
[30427.78s -> 30431.78s]  Absolutely fucking insane amount of money.
[30431.78s -> 30437.27s]  Thank you.
[30437.27s -> 30440.85s]  DeuceTheGamer, that means a lot.
[30440.85s -> 30442.85s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[30442.85s -> 30445.48s]  That's the most fucking money ever.
[30445.48s -> 30451.49s]  Watch your language, I'm sorry.
[30451.49s -> 30454.05s]  Thank you Carrot for the five dollars.
[30454.05s -> 30458.05s]  There's a stream where we bullied Jerma by throwing money at him until he cried.
[30458.05s -> 30466.64s]  Well worth it for the greatest funny man on Twitch.
[30466.64s -> 30468.64s]  I know we all appreciate how hard you worked, so please.
[30468.64s -> 30472.64s]  To please us, greedy gremlins sitting at home.
[30472.64s -> 30476.29s]  Much love.
[30476.29s -> 30478.29s]  Thank you, Carrot.
[30478.29s -> 30485.52s]  I don't think you guys are greedy at all.
[30485.52s -> 30487.89s]  GarfieldTheMondayKillit, there's Garfield.
[30487.89s -> 30489.89s]  Thank you, Garfield, for the one dollar.
[30489.89s -> 30491.89s]  Ahoy there, landlubbers.
[30491.89s -> 30493.89s]  Ahoy in that. Come on, Jerma, burn that fat.
[30493.89s -> 30496.89s]  I'm glad you found out I'm interning at Nintendo.
[30496.89s -> 30500.89s]  They wanted to use my writing skills for Garfographs in their game.
[30500.89s -> 30503.89s]  Unfortunately, the Labo branch of the company was closed down.
[30503.89s -> 30506.89s]  I'm emptying out my office as we speak.
[30506.89s -> 30508.89s]  Yeah, they gave an office to an intern.
[30508.89s -> 30512.89s]  Hey, Jerma, when you lie in bed and think how the stream was possible,
[30512.89s -> 30518.73s]  imagine Garfield fishing for trout in Alaska and donating trout bits.
[30518.73s -> 30522.06s]  Thank you.
[30522.06s -> 30524.06s]  Thank you, Garfield.
[30524.06s -> 30527.06s]  Hopefully Nintendo brings you back.
[30527.06s -> 30532.73s]  Thank you, WinzRind, for the five dollars.
[30532.73s -> 30535.10s]  Hey, Jerma, I have this relevant image.
[30535.10s -> 30540.94s]  Okay, why did you send a check for ten thousand dollars to Jerma985?
[30540.94s -> 30542.94s]  I like their product.
[30542.94s -> 30545.94s]  I wanted them to have a little walking around money.
[30545.94s -> 30549.84s]  Here is the image.
[30549.84s -> 30552.17s]  Thank you.
[30552.17s -> 30555.37s]  Thank you, WinzRind.
[30555.37s -> 30557.85s]  Walking around money.
[30557.85s -> 30558.85s]  But thanks to the five bucks, dude.
[30558.85s -> 30563.03s]  Thank you, Tantyrotenna, for the one dollar.
[30563.03s -> 30566.29s]  Sniff update, please.
[30566.29s -> 30567.29s]  Sniff update.
[30567.29s -> 30570.41s]  What does that mean?
[30570.41s -> 30574.64s]  Sniff update?
[30574.64s -> 30575.64s]  I don't understand.
[30575.64s -> 30576.64s]  Oh, the dog smell.
[30576.64s -> 30579.60s]  Yeah, whatever.
[30579.60s -> 30580.60s]  Thank you.
[30580.60s -> 30583.10s]  Funny and relatable username for the one dollar.
[30583.10s -> 30586.60s]  Hey, Jerma, here's a dollar to fuel your crippling chicken nugget addiction.
[30586.60s -> 30590.16s]  We touched upon it earlier, but thank you.
[30590.16s -> 30592.16s]  Devakitty, thanks for the one dollar, Devakitty.
[30592.16s -> 30594.72s]  Just add this to the money pile, Jerma.
[30594.72s -> 30600.72s]  On another note, I've been feeling awful about how long it has taken for me to get HRT.
[30600.72s -> 30604.96s]  But one of my last appointments with my clinician is in early December,
[30604.96s -> 30608.13s]  and you helped me hold myself from falling apart in the last eight years.
[30608.13s -> 30612.13s]  I've had to endure dysphoria, and for that I am sincerely grateful.
[30612.13s -> 30616.37s]  So wish me luck in getting myself some tit-tax.
[30616.37s -> 30618.37s]  We all love you, Jerma, transgender pride.
[30618.37s -> 30621.76s]  Thank you so much, Devakitty.
[30621.76s -> 30627.24s]  I will tell you, like I've said this before a thousand times,
[30627.24s -> 30633.64s]  be the person that you are the most comfortable being.
[30633.64s -> 30637.48s]  Whatever you're the most comfortable being, whoever you are,
[30637.48s -> 30638.48s]  much love to you, for real.
[30638.48s -> 30646.40s]  Whoever, wherever, whenever.
[30646.40s -> 30648.40s]  I've said it before, but I will reiterate it again.
[30648.40s -> 30654.34s]  Thank you so much.
[30654.34s -> 30661.79s]  Best of luck to you.
[30661.79s -> 30663.79s]  And we move on to Tiny.
[30663.79s -> 30665.79s]  Thank you, Tiny, 840 for the 10 bucks.
[30665.79s -> 30668.16s]  I can't give nearly as much as some people here.
[30668.16s -> 30670.59s]  We touched upon this before.
[30670.59s -> 30673.60s]  Show my appreciation for what you do for all of us.
[30673.60s -> 30674.60s]  Thank you.
[30674.60s -> 30675.90s]  Thank you, Tiny.
[30675.90s -> 30678.42s]  Thank you for everything.
[30678.42s -> 30681.88s]  Dubski, dude, thanks for the one dollar.
[30681.88s -> 30684.88s]  Jerma, you are the worst influence on my life.
[30684.88s -> 30685.88s]  Holy shit.
[30685.88s -> 30686.88s]  This got different.
[30686.88s -> 30687.88s]  This got like a little weird.
[30687.88s -> 30690.88s]  I thought it was going to be like, oh, thanks.
[30690.88s -> 30691.88s]  Nope.
[30691.88s -> 30692.88s]  Not this one.
[30692.88s -> 30695.88s]  Jerma, you're the worst influence on my life.
[30695.88s -> 30699.88s]  Your stream has made me extremely paranoid of people who just want to steal my expensive rifle.
[30699.88s -> 30702.88s]  And you convinced me to hijack a train and fill it with corpses.
[30702.88s -> 30705.88s]  Worst of all, I said ha ha pee pee poo poo to my own mother.
[30705.88s -> 30706.88s]  Arrest this person.
[30706.88s -> 30707.88s]  Arrest this streamer.
[30707.88s -> 30713.38s]  There's so many like, nice.
[30713.38s -> 30714.38s]  Oh, thank you so much.
[30714.38s -> 30716.38s]  And then, oh, you're the worst.
[30716.38s -> 30721.91s]  Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[30721.91s -> 30722.91s]  Thank you, Dubski.
[30722.91s -> 30723.91s]  Sorry to hear about that.
[30723.91s -> 30727.21s]  ACDC, freak, thanks for the bits.
[30727.21s -> 30729.64s]  It's not much, but you're my favorite person on Twitch.
[30729.64s -> 30732.10s]  Thank you.
[30732.10s -> 30735.04s]  Devakitty, thanks for the one dollar.
[30735.04s -> 30736.04s]  Again, thank you, Devakitty.
[30736.04s -> 30740.04s]  Oh yeah, I also just finished a marathon-length domination-only game of Civilization V,
[30740.04s -> 30742.04s]  so just call me a regular fucking pro gamer.
[30742.04s -> 30744.44s]  How long is that?
[30744.44s -> 30748.28s]  How long does that take?
[30748.28s -> 30749.84s]  That's a long time.
[30749.84s -> 30757.86s]  A marathon-length domination-only game.
[30757.86s -> 30761.68s]  Is that like, that's actually so long.
[30761.68s -> 30763.75s]  How long?
[30764.75s -> 30765.75s]  That's a lot.
[30765.75s -> 30768.05s]  Maybe like 50 hours?
[30768.05s -> 30769.05s]  Holy shit.
[30769.05s -> 30771.64s]  At least an hour.
[30771.64s -> 30774.52s]  Well, congratulations on that.
[30774.52s -> 30777.27s]  Civ 5.
[30777.27s -> 30778.27s]  Never played it.
[30778.27s -> 30781.00s]  I respect it, though.
[30781.00s -> 30784.00s]  Rocketfinger, thanks for the six dollars and 50 cents.
[30784.00s -> 30785.00s]  Jerma Hart, no message.
[30785.00s -> 30787.00s]  Thank you, but just Jerma Hart.
[30787.00s -> 30789.56s]  Right back at you.
[30789.56s -> 30793.56s]  Thank you, JupaCross, for the 95 cents.
[30793.56s -> 30794.56s]  One dollar, round it up there.
[30794.56s -> 30795.56s]  Jerma, we all love you.
[30795.56s -> 30796.56s]  You lack in height.
[30796.56s -> 30797.56s]  You make up with personality.
[30797.56s -> 30801.56s]  You're an inspiration, proving that even short men can get a girlfriend.
[30801.56s -> 30804.56s]  And I rounded you 95 cents up to a dollar.
[30804.56s -> 30806.12s]  And that's what I said.
[30806.12s -> 30807.12s]  And that's what you said.
[30807.12s -> 30810.12s]  All right, great.
[30810.12s -> 30812.12s]  Should have just rounded it down.
[30812.12s -> 30814.12s]  Thanks for the 95 cents.
[30814.12s -> 30816.30s]  Appreciate it, JupaCross.
[30816.30s -> 30817.48s]  Appreciate that, dude.
[30817.48s -> 30818.48s]  Thank you.
[30818.48s -> 30819.48s]  And yes, it's true.
[30819.48s -> 30820.48s]  It doesn't matter.
[30820.48s -> 30821.48s]  Everyone will find somebody.
[30821.48s -> 30822.48s]  You are correct.
[30822.48s -> 30824.48s]  Thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the two dollars and 76 cents.
[30824.48s -> 30827.65s]  Here's your thousand dollars of Zimbabwe dollars.
[30827.65s -> 30828.65s]  Thank you, Sticks.
[30828.65s -> 30829.65s]  Welcome back.
[30829.65s -> 30831.15s]  Much love to you, dude.
[30831.15s -> 30838.68s]  Round it down like it's height.
[30838.68s -> 30840.68s]  Busy Work, thanks for the three bucks, Busy Work.
[30840.68s -> 30842.86s]  Grab that auto, owes you money.
[30842.86s -> 30846.57s]  Thanks for the three bucks, Busy Work.
[30846.57s -> 30847.57s]  Appreciate that.
[30847.57s -> 30852.24s]  Dot Shaft, thanks for the 10 bucks, Dot Shaft.
[30852.24s -> 30854.24s]  Just cry so we can go to bed.
[30854.24s -> 30855.80s]  It was close.
[30855.80s -> 30856.80s]  Almost got me.
[30856.80s -> 30859.56s]  But I did start thinking about it.
[30859.56s -> 30862.56s]  And it was making me really, really emotional.
[30862.56s -> 30863.56s]  But I was good.
[30863.56s -> 30866.56s]  I had a couple more glasses of wine, and I was all set.
[30866.56s -> 30870.92s]  Thank you, though, Dot Shaft, for the 10, 10 dollars.
[30870.92s -> 30874.06s]  Flying Sombrero, thanks for the one dollar.
[30874.06s -> 30876.06s]  Everyone has given bits tonight, so here's my contribution.
[30876.06s -> 30880.43s]  I'm hoping you do a germa ultimate rumble when the new Smash Brothers comes out.
[30880.43s -> 30882.43s]  Thanks for the streams.
[30882.43s -> 30884.80s]  You'll always be our favorite tiny man.
[30884.80s -> 30887.25s]  Five eight.
[30887.25s -> 30890.63s]  I mean, who's counting, right?
[30890.63s -> 30891.63s]  Five eight.
[30891.63s -> 30892.63s]  Five foot eight.
[30892.63s -> 30895.51s]  Five foot eight inches.
[30895.51s -> 30899.56s]  Five feet, and then eight inches after five feet.
[30899.56s -> 30900.93s]  Five eight.
[30900.93s -> 30904.20s]  Five seven, but five eight with shoes on.
[30904.20s -> 30907.51s]  Let me correct that.
[30907.51s -> 30908.51s]  Thank you.
[30908.51s -> 30910.51s]  Thank you, Onyx Blaze, for the three bucks.
[30910.51s -> 30911.51s]  Pogchamp, Pogchamp.
[30911.51s -> 30912.51s]  Thank you, Pogchamp.
[30912.51s -> 30915.51s]  Well, thank you, Onyx Blaze, for your Pogchamps, for the three bucks.
[30915.51s -> 30918.71s]  Onyx Blaze again, for the two dollars.
[30918.71s -> 30919.71s]  Thanos car.
[30919.71s -> 30922.14s]  Some meme, I guess.
[30922.14s -> 30925.21s]  Digit Guy, thanks for the one dollar.
[30925.21s -> 30926.21s]  I found this in my couch cushions.
[30926.21s -> 30927.21s]  Am I cool yet?
[30927.21s -> 30929.45s]  Also, chug that.
[30929.45s -> 30930.82s]  I believe I did.
[30930.82s -> 30932.76s]  Thank you.
[30932.76s -> 30934.76s]  For another dollar, Digit Guy, I'm the guy in the car.
[30934.76s -> 30940.61s]  I don't know what that means.
[30940.61s -> 30941.61s]  I don't know what that means.
[30941.61s -> 30942.61s]  I'm the guy in the car.
[30942.61s -> 30946.16s]  Thanks.
[30946.16s -> 30949.16s]  Sieg's Corner, thanks for the one dollar.
[30949.16s -> 30951.16s]  I'm the guy next to the guy in the car.
[30951.16s -> 30955.80s]  We both drive.
[30955.80s -> 30956.80s]  All right.
[30956.80s -> 30960.23s]  Thank you, Sieg's Corner and Digit Guy.
[30960.23s -> 30963.23s]  Creepy Ghost Sales, thanks for one dollar.
[30963.23s -> 30965.98s]  I need to get in on this.
[30965.98s -> 30967.73s]  Oh, the loud car that drove by.
[30967.73s -> 30968.73s]  Right, okay.
[30968.73s -> 30969.73s]  That makes sense.
[30969.73s -> 30971.04s]  Thank you, Creepy Ghost Sales.
[30971.04s -> 30976.94s]  Thank you to a ton of people who gave 50 cents.
[30976.94s -> 30979.08s]  A bunch of you in a row.
[30979.08s -> 30983.36s]  Thank you, all of you.
[30983.36s -> 30986.36s]  Swiggity Dank, thanks for the 15 bucks, Swiggity Dank.
[30986.36s -> 30987.36s]  Let's get those bits.
[30987.36s -> 30989.31s]  Okay.
[30989.31s -> 30993.89s]  YouTuber for five years have video from seven years ago.
[30993.89s -> 31002.24s]  Well, I haven't updated my biography on Twitch in two years, so that makes sense.
[31002.24s -> 31004.24s]  Swiggity Dank, thanks for 15 dollars, dude.
[31004.24s -> 31005.48s]  Let's get those bits.
[31005.48s -> 31010.04s]  Well, you brought a bunch of them, so thank you.
[31010.04s -> 31012.04s]  Shimmy Sham, thanks for two bucks.
[31012.04s -> 31015.41s]  I want to see Italics's face.
[31015.41s -> 31017.41s]  Sorry, you can't see his face.
[31017.41s -> 31020.79s]  He is faceless tonight.
[31020.79s -> 31022.79s]  More, a bunch of 50 cents coming in from a ton of people.
[31022.79s -> 31023.79s]  Thank you guys so much.
[31023.79s -> 31026.35s]  Ton of gifted fucking subs.
[31026.35s -> 31029.48s]  Thank you, Trotter, for the one dollar.
[31029.48s -> 31031.48s]  Get that bread, my gamer.
[31031.48s -> 31032.48s]  And Germanose, wipe German heart.
[31032.48s -> 31038.35s]  Your Twitch bio is when you only had five emotes.
[31038.35s -> 31040.35s]  Yeah, but those are like the five good ones.
[31040.35s -> 31045.00s]  Actually, there's like at least 10 more that I would say are good.
[31045.00s -> 31048.52s]  Good ones.
[31048.52s -> 31052.84s]  I have like 15 great emotes now.
[31052.84s -> 31057.60s]  Thank you, Trotter, though.
[31057.60s -> 31058.60s]  The one dollar.
[31058.60s -> 31059.60s]  Get that bread.
[31059.60s -> 31060.60s]  I won't for now.
[31060.60s -> 31061.84s]  Star Wolf Ken.

[31065.84s -> 31066.84s]  Thank you, German heart.
[31066.84s -> 31068.85s]  No message.
[31068.85s -> 31070.09s]  Thank you.
[31070.09s -> 31071.09s]  No comment.
[31071.09s -> 31074.19s]  34 gave one dollar.
[31074.19s -> 31075.19s]  I suck.
[31075.19s -> 31080.08s]  I'm bored when I do that.
[31080.08s -> 31082.00s]  Kappa.
[31082.00s -> 31084.24s]  You suck on Tootsie Rolls.
[31084.24s -> 31086.68s]  Thank you for that.
[31086.68s -> 31087.68s]  No comment.
[31087.68s -> 31088.68s]  34.
[31088.68s -> 31089.68s]  Thank you.
[31089.68s -> 31090.92s]  It is Kat.
[31090.92s -> 31092.73s]  Thanks for the bits.
[31092.73s -> 31093.73s]  Thank you, Star Wolf Ken, for the one dollar.
[31093.73s -> 31095.73s]  Is this a streamer who cried on stream?
[31095.73s -> 31096.73s]  I didn't.
[31096.73s -> 31098.87s]  I did not.
[31098.87s -> 31102.17s]  Thank you, FussyFuck, for the one dollar.
[31102.17s -> 31112.64s]  Thank you, WinzRyant, for the three bucks.
[31112.64s -> 31118.59s]  Your streams are getting me through fall classes while I have a chronic sinus infection,
[31118.59s -> 31120.21s]  so you're priceless.
[31120.21s -> 31121.21s]  Keep up the good times.
[31121.21s -> 31123.96s]  Thank you, WinzRyant, for the three bucks.
[31123.96s -> 31125.46s]  Good luck on your fall classes.
[31125.46s -> 31128.46s]  Hopefully you get an A- on all of them.
[31128.46s -> 31129.96s]  Thank you.
[31129.96s -> 31132.28s]  The long egg.
[31132.28s -> 31133.28s]  Thanks for one dollar.
[31133.28s -> 31134.28s]  Very emotional stream.
[31134.28s -> 31136.28s]  I almost cried myself.
[31136.28s -> 31139.28s]  Maybe it's from painkillers from my surgery, but you demand.
[31139.28s -> 31140.46s]  Hopefully your surgery went well.
[31140.46s -> 31147.76s]  Hopefully you're recovering, and hopefully you get stronger every day.
[31147.76s -> 31148.76s]  Thank you so much.
[31148.76s -> 31152.11s]  The long egg.
[31152.11s -> 31154.11s]  He used to play the A- thing before B+.
[31154.11s -> 31158.40s]  You got to wish everybody for a B+.
[31158.40s -> 31159.89s]  Double 11.
[31159.89s -> 31160.89s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[31160.89s -> 31161.89s]  Double D. Double 11.
[31161.89s -> 31163.52s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[31163.52s -> 31166.52s]  Welcome to episode one of Dermacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[31166.52s -> 31167.52s]  This is going to be a single player.
[31167.52s -> 31170.52s]  I said what you wanted me to do.
[31170.52s -> 31173.69s]  DivUSP, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[31173.69s -> 31175.69s]  I'm running out of ad bits, but fuck it.
[31175.69s -> 31176.69s]  Laughing my ass off.
[31176.69s -> 31180.69s]  Thank you, DivUSP, for your multiple contributions.
[31180.69s -> 31182.70s]  10 bucks.
[31182.70s -> 31184.96s]  10 bucks here.
[31184.96s -> 31188.96s]  Tons of money over the course of the last at least few months.
[31188.96s -> 31189.96s]  Thanks a lot, man.
[31189.96s -> 31193.90s]  Zareth, thanks for five dollars, Zareth.
[31193.90s -> 31198.16s]  I've been following you for a few years, and you never failed to make my days better.
[31198.16s -> 31199.16s]  Thank you for all you've done.
[31199.16s -> 31203.81s]  Thank you for the five dollars, and thanks for being here.
[31203.81s -> 31205.88s]  Ten dollars out of ads.
[31205.88s -> 31206.88s]  That is a lot.
[31206.88s -> 31211.47s]  TwoBit, thank you TwoBit for the three bucks.
[31211.47s -> 31212.47s]  Jerma, you deserve every bit you get.
[31212.47s -> 31217.64s]  I wish I could give more because of every year since I found you on YouTube seven years ago.
[31217.64s -> 31219.88s]  Thank you, and here's to many more.
[31219.88s -> 31223.56s]  I'm going to go as long as I can.
[31223.56s -> 31227.37s]  Thank you, TwoBit for the three bucks.
[31227.37s -> 31230.74s]  Truna, thank you Truna for the ten dollars.
[31230.74s -> 31231.74s]  Ten bucks from Truna.
[31231.74s -> 31235.24s]  Hey dude, I don't really know how Twitch works as I always watch you on YouTube,
[31235.24s -> 31238.24s]  but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what you do.
[31238.24s -> 31240.54s]  You make me cry laughing more times than I can count,
[31240.54s -> 31242.54s]  and you never fail to cheer me up.
[31242.54s -> 31243.91s]  Love you, dude.
[31243.91s -> 31245.79s]  Thank you, Truna.
[31250.23s -> 31259.32s]  Add yourself to the list of people that have just given such immense support over the years,
[31259.32s -> 31263.07s]  and thank you so much for watching on YouTube.
[31263.07s -> 31267.57s]  It means a lot.
[31267.57s -> 31268.57s]  That's fucking incredible.
[31268.57s -> 31270.20s]  Thank you.
[31270.20s -> 31271.20s]  I'm glad you enjoy it.
[31271.20s -> 31272.20s]  I'm glad you're having fun.
[31272.20s -> 31278.17s]  Welcome to Twitch, by the way.
[31278.17s -> 31281.17s]  If you're not a Twitch viewer, welcome to Twitch.
[31281.17s -> 31283.12s]  No comment.
[31283.12s -> 31284.12s]  Thanks for the one dollar, no comment.
[31284.12s -> 31286.68s]  One dollar and nine cents.
[31286.68s -> 31291.68s]  They say this is just all my money, and well actually it's two dollars and ten cents.
[31291.68s -> 31295.36s]  They say I'm gay, and this is all my money.
[31295.36s -> 31301.14s]  Pride one ten, or pride two ten, actually.
[31301.14s -> 31304.28s]  Thank you so much, no comment.
[31304.28s -> 31305.28s]  Thanks for the two bucks.
[31305.28s -> 31314.26s]  Appreciate that.
[31314.26s -> 31318.76s]  Wish you the best.
[31318.76s -> 31320.76s]  Thank you, pop them tarts.
[31320.76s -> 31323.52s]  I'd give so much more if I could.
[31323.52s -> 31325.52s]  You're generally a nice guy, and you deserve the world.
[31325.52s -> 31328.84s]  Maybe a small piece of the world.
[31328.84s -> 31329.84s]  Not all of it, though.
[31329.84s -> 31330.84s]  It's too much.
[31330.84s -> 31332.84s]  Nobody wants that much.
[31332.84s -> 31334.72s]  It's too much world.
[31334.72s -> 31336.72s]  That's too much world to have, you know what I mean?
[31338.73s -> 31340.73s]  Sapping my bin yacht.
[31340.73s -> 31341.73s]  Thanks for the 95 cents.
[31341.73s -> 31342.73s]  Rounding it up to a dollar.
[31342.73s -> 31343.73s]  What we're doing tonight here.
[31343.73s -> 31345.48s]  That's what we're doing.
[31345.48s -> 31346.48s]  Hey, Jerma, thanks for streaming.
[31346.48s -> 31352.79s]  Ever since I found you a while ago through a certain droney, you've brightened up my days.
[31352.79s -> 31355.79s]  Here's a hundred bits for every time you've made me laugh and smile.
[31355.79s -> 31360.91s]  Here's a hundred bits for every time you've made me laugh.
[31360.91s -> 31361.91s]  This is 95.
[31361.91s -> 31363.66s]  How many?
[31363.66s -> 31366.22s]  So I've only made you smile once.
[31369.10s -> 31370.10s]  Oh, not even.
[31370.10s -> 31373.39s]  95.
[31374.39s -> 31376.91s]  Oh, man.
[31376.91s -> 31377.91s]  That's good.
[31377.91s -> 31380.21s]  Well, Vinny is a great fucking guy.
[31380.21s -> 31384.60s]  So I'm happy you even came over here from Vinny's channel.
[31384.60s -> 31386.60s]  He's a fucking fantastic streamer.
[31386.60s -> 31389.36s]  And he is a friend.
[31389.36s -> 31392.11s]  So it's great, dude.
[31392.11s -> 31399.98s]  Thank you to Brand The Mans for the one dollar.
[31399.98s -> 31403.98s]  Hey, Jerma, the work you do here on Twitch is truly amazing, and your streams are worth every penny.
[31403.98s -> 31405.98s]  Don't ever doubt yourself of the value of the streams.
[31405.98s -> 31406.98s]  We love you.
[31406.98s -> 31411.27s]  Thank you, Brand The Man.
[31411.27s -> 31415.71s]  Really appreciate that.
[31415.71s -> 31416.71s]  Thanks for the kind words.
[31417.71s -> 31420.20s]  I am a Ribbit.
[31420.20s -> 31421.20s]  Thanks for one dollar.
[31421.20s -> 31422.20s]  No message.
[31422.20s -> 31423.44s]  Elizabeth.
[31423.44s -> 31424.44s]  Thanks for one dollar.
[31424.44s -> 31426.44s]  Did you see Vinny talking about how you landed in Vegas?
[31426.44s -> 31427.44s]  Yeah.
[31427.44s -> 31428.81s]  I was in his dryer.
[31428.81s -> 31431.81s]  We talked about his dryer and how, you know, he puts some raw meat in there.
[31431.81s -> 31434.05s]  It's in the vod somewhere.
[31434.05s -> 31437.05s]  He was good to me for a little while.
[31437.05s -> 31440.05s]  I screamed a lot, but he would be like, stop screaming.
[31440.05s -> 31442.05s]  And I'd be like, OK, jeez.
[31442.05s -> 31443.05s]  It hurts.
[31443.05s -> 31447.43s]  You turn the dryer on.
[31447.43s -> 31449.43s]  But thank you, Zazasoft, for the one dollar.
[31449.43s -> 31451.43s]  I don't have big bits or good joke to contribute.
[31451.43s -> 31453.43s]  I'm just looking forward to the future of the stream.
[31453.43s -> 31456.37s]  Don't worry about giving me huge amounts of money.
[31456.37s -> 31459.56s]  Your viewership is enough.
[31459.56s -> 31461.50s]  And I truly mean that.
[31461.50s -> 31464.50s]  So thank you, Zazasoft, for the one dollar.
[31464.50s -> 31468.25s]  And your body, your eyes here, right?
[31468.25s -> 31469.25s]  Like you're sitting there.
[31469.25s -> 31470.25s]  You're watching.
[31470.25s -> 31472.13s]  That's incredibly important.
[31472.13s -> 31473.82s]  It means a lot.
[31473.82s -> 31478.56s]  He was worried about the jokes.
[31478.56s -> 31479.56s]  Wait, what?
[31479.56s -> 31483.87s]  No, no.
[31483.87s -> 31484.87s]  Not your body.
[31484.87s -> 31485.87s]  No.
[31485.87s -> 31487.87s]  I mean like you sitting down.
[31487.87s -> 31491.09s]  Hey, Darkstar.
[31491.09s -> 31492.09s]  Thanks for the one dollar, Darkstar.
[31492.09s -> 31496.09s]  My siblings and I have a tradition of making silly short films every Christmas.
[31496.09s -> 31498.09s]  And this year we're planning on making a western.
[31498.09s -> 31505.09s]  This may seem random, but what would a good kryptonite for an army of a hundred grizzly bears be?
[31505.09s -> 31509.02s]  A steak.
[31509.02s -> 31512.96s]  Just like a pound of ground beef.
[31512.96s -> 31517.32s]  They would just go after it.
[31517.32s -> 31519.84s]  Honey?
[31519.84s -> 31520.84s]  No, honey.
[31520.84s -> 31521.84s]  That's Winnie the Pooh.
[31521.84s -> 31526.55s]  One pound of ground beef, and it'll be a fucking nightmare.
[31526.55s -> 31529.68s]  Rat poison?
[31529.68s -> 31531.95s]  Holy shit.
[31531.95s -> 31533.95s]  Thank you High Fire Spirit for the one dollar.
[31533.95s -> 31534.95s]  Neat.
[31534.95s -> 31537.02s]  I'm a sub now.
[31537.02s -> 31538.02s]  Welcome to the sub team.
[31538.02s -> 31542.20s]  We don't really have a team or anything, but welcome.
[31542.20s -> 31543.20s]  Regardless.
[31543.20s -> 31549.09s]  Where are we at here?
[31549.09s -> 31558.29s]  Getting to the end here.
[31558.29s -> 31560.29s]  Somebody said, carrot seven.
[31560.29s -> 31561.29s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[31561.29s -> 31562.29s]  Shut up and watch.
[31562.29s -> 31563.29s]  This is your origin story.
[31563.29s -> 31573.07s]  What the hell is this?
[31573.07s -> 31574.07s]  I can't click it.
[31574.07s -> 31579.15s]  There we go.
[31579.15s -> 31582.15s]  Please join a movement of six million Americans to impeach Donald Trump.
[31582.15s -> 31584.15s]  This is not my origin story.
[31584.15s -> 31587.52s]  This is the most corrupt president.
[31587.52s -> 31589.52s]  This is not my origin story.
[31589.52s -> 31590.52s]  This is an ad.
[31590.52s -> 31592.52s]  Hold on.
[31592.52s -> 31595.52s]  Hello, everybody.
[31595.52s -> 31598.52s]  My name is Hill Joe Golem.
[31598.52s -> 31603.52s]  I'm Jeremy's grandfather.
[31603.52s -> 31607.52s]  And today we're going to play Insane Aquarium.
[31607.52s -> 31613.52s]  It's the best game you can ever buy.
[31613.52s -> 31616.52s]  This is my origin story.
[31616.52s -> 31618.52s]  I don't really play.
[31618.52s -> 31620.52s]  I just like bumped the keyboard.
[31620.52s -> 31623.52s]  Hello, everybody.
[31623.52s -> 31627.69s]  My name is your origin story.
[31627.69s -> 31628.69s]  Oh, like it.
[31628.69s -> 31629.69s]  Here's the link.
[31629.69s -> 31631.69s]  This is the fucking first grandpa video.
[31631.69s -> 31638.37s]  There you go.
[31638.37s -> 31640.37s]  Oh, my God.
[31640.37s -> 31653.19s]  My fucking head is in the video.
[31653.19s -> 31657.45s]  Hello, everybody.
[31657.45s -> 31658.45s]  Let's watch it.
[31658.45s -> 31659.45s]  Fine.
[31659.45s -> 31660.45s]  Fuck it.
[31660.45s -> 31663.45s]  Oh, we need to work together to impeach.
[31663.45s -> 31665.76s]  Hey, Jeremy, here's your origin story.
[31665.76s -> 31672.98s]  Oh, what in the name of God is this person talking about?
[31672.98s -> 31676.20s]  All right.
[31676.20s -> 31679.49s]  Let's watch it.
[31679.49s -> 31681.49s]  Hello, everybody.
[31681.49s -> 31685.92s]  My name is Hill Joe Golem.
[31685.92s -> 31689.92s]  I'm Jeremy's grandfather.
[31689.92s -> 31694.29s]  And today we're going to play Insane Aquarium.
[31694.29s -> 31696.29s]  The deluxe mode.
[31696.29s -> 31699.29s]  It's the best game you can ever buy.
[31699.29s -> 31701.66s]  And it's loading it right now.
[31701.66s -> 31704.66s]  Why are we picking up my first three videos I've ever made?
[31704.66s -> 31705.66s]  I don't really play video games.
[31705.66s -> 31707.66s]  They hurt my brain.
[31707.66s -> 31709.66s]  And I wish this noise.
[31709.66s -> 31711.66s]  We got to click here to play.
[31711.66s -> 31716.41s]  I play casual games because I'm an idiot.
[31716.41s -> 31719.41s]  I'm just.
[31719.41s -> 31722.41s]  OK, what am I doing here?
[31722.41s -> 31729.41s]  I want to do challenge mode because I know I want a new game.
[31729.41s -> 31730.41s]  New fucking game.
[31730.41s -> 31735.41s]  OK, let's try take number three because I still can't beat it.
[31735.41s -> 31739.41s]  I like to use the crab and I like to use the other crab.
[31739.41s -> 31741.41s]  And I like to use the floating crab.
[31741.41s -> 31745.41s]  Well, you know, to get the money in the beginning, you know.
[31745.41s -> 31747.41s]  OK, so it starts.
[31747.41s -> 31750.41s]  You click to feed these little fish face fucks.
[31750.41s -> 31754.41s]  And then, you know, they drop the dog shit.
[31754.41s -> 31756.41s]  And you click and you get money.
[31756.41s -> 31757.41s]  Two frames a second.
[31757.41s -> 31760.41s]  And you click again and you get more money.
[31760.41s -> 31765.41s]  And then my game is lagging really badly right now.
[31765.41s -> 31768.41s]  Click that money right there.
[31768.41s -> 31773.41s]  The whole point of this, by the way, folks, is you want to try and get as much money.
[31773.41s -> 31776.41s]  You can pay for your daughter's wedding.
[31776.41s -> 31780.41s]  At least that's what I pretend it is.
[31780.41s -> 31782.41s]  OK, so we got four fishes here.
[31782.41s -> 31785.41s]  Do you think people are going to watch it?
[31785.41s -> 31788.41s]  And I got my little friend Steve over here.
[31788.41s -> 31790.41s]  I think that's his name.
[31790.41s -> 31795.41s]  So the whole point is you want to give these guys delicious worm cakes.
[31795.41s -> 31797.41s]  And hold on a minute.
[31797.41s -> 31800.41s]  I have to diarrhea.
[31800.41s -> 31803.78s]  What?
[31803.78s -> 31804.78s]  OK.
[31804.78s -> 31805.78s]  OK.
[31805.78s -> 31808.78s]  I'm back from diarrhea.
[31808.78s -> 31814.78s]  I got a big fishy in diarrhea.
[31814.78s -> 31817.78s]  Oh, fuck.
[31817.78s -> 31819.78s]  Somebody fucking died.
[31819.78s -> 31820.78s]  And I got an alien.
[31820.78s -> 31821.78s]  Oh, this is bad.
[31821.78s -> 31824.78s]  You're going to shoot these fucking aliens.
[31824.78s -> 31827.04s]  Oh, my God.
[31827.04s -> 31830.04s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[31830.04s -> 31831.04s]  Don't worry, everybody.
[31831.04s -> 31834.04s]  I got a fucking diamond.
[31834.04s -> 31837.28s]  That means we can buy extra food.
[31837.28s -> 31840.28s]  $315.
[31840.28s -> 31841.28s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[31841.28s -> 31843.28s]  $318 for food?
[31843.28s -> 31844.28s]  Do I lose?
[31844.28s -> 31848.29s]  Oh, you got to be shitting me.
[31848.29s -> 31850.29s]  Can you hear my dog?
[31850.29s -> 31852.29s]  So I'm doing pretty well here.
[31852.29s -> 31855.29s]  I got a big fish here.
[31855.29s -> 31856.29s]  Like I told you.
[31856.29s -> 31860.29s]  Like I told you before, I'm making lots of cash.
[31860.29s -> 31863.29s]  I'm going to upgrade my food quality.
[31863.29s -> 31864.29s]  Oh, shit.
[31864.29s -> 31865.29s]  Got to pick that up.
[31865.29s -> 31866.29s]  And the silver ones, too.
[31866.29s -> 31869.29s]  Remember, silver's worth something to him.
[31869.29s -> 31872.29s]  I don't know what this fucking face is for.
[31872.29s -> 31873.29s]  I don't know who the guppy is.
[31873.29s -> 31874.29s]  Guppy cruncher.
[31874.29s -> 31875.29s]  Oh, God.
[31875.29s -> 31879.29s]  Why did you think this was a good idea to upload?
[31879.29s -> 31880.29s]  I don't know.
[31880.29s -> 31883.90s]  What the fuck?
[31883.90s -> 31884.90s]  Just a second.
[31884.90s -> 31886.52s]  What is this?
[31886.52s -> 31891.02s]  This game is a bunch of bullshit.
[31891.02s -> 31892.84s]  Oh, my.
[31893.84s -> 31894.84s]  You got it.
[31894.84s -> 31895.84s]  Whatever.
[31895.84s -> 31898.84s]  You know, I'm returning this game.
[31898.84s -> 31901.84s]  I'm going to return this game today.
[31901.84s -> 31906.14s]  And oh, hello there, Suzy.
[31906.14s -> 31908.14s]  What's your name?
[31908.14s -> 31909.14s]  Never seen you.
[31909.14s -> 31912.14s]  What was I just saying about?
[31912.14s -> 31913.14s]  Oh, yeah.
[31913.14s -> 31919.14s]  I think I was saying I was going to play challenge mode.
[31919.14s -> 31925.14s]  And I need you to beat tank three, because I didn't beat tank three yet, OK?
[31925.14s -> 31930.14s]  I need to pick crab and other crab and this crab.
[31930.14s -> 31932.14s]  Do I do it again?
[31932.14s -> 31938.14s]  The point of this game is you want to feed these fishes and they collect the dog food.
[31938.14s -> 31940.14s]  Do I do the whole video again?
[31940.14s -> 31943.14s]  The whole point is you want to try and feed them.
[31943.14s -> 31948.14s]  And like I do, you've got to be careful because aliens come up.
[31949.64s -> 31952.20s]  What is it?
[31952.20s -> 31956.78s]  I'm playing a fucking video game.
[31956.78s -> 31959.56s]  I don't care.
[31959.56s -> 31961.56s]  You can go to hell.
[31961.56s -> 31964.97s]  OK.
[31964.97s -> 31966.97s]  I'll be up for dinner in a minute.
[31966.97s -> 31967.97s]  OK.
[31971.60s -> 31972.60s]  OK.
[31972.60s -> 31980.55s]  Like I was saying, oops, all of your fish have died.
[31980.55s -> 31990.60s]  Is that it?
[31991.60s -> 31995.60s]  You can hear the microphone.
[31995.60s -> 32002.28s]  You can hear the microphone get bumped.
[32002.28s -> 32003.28s]  What a shit video.
[32003.28s -> 32005.28s]  That was my third video I ever made.
[32005.28s -> 32007.28s]  I think I was testing.
[32007.28s -> 32010.72s]  Here's the story behind that video.
[32010.72s -> 32014.28s]  I was testing to see if fraps.
[32014.28s -> 32016.28s]  Remember the not DX story, not OBS.
[32016.28s -> 32021.19s]  Fraps could capture a game like that.
[32021.19s -> 32025.84s]  So just test.
[32025.84s -> 32030.92s]  Anyways, where were we here?
[32030.92s -> 32037.00s]  We were.
[32037.00s -> 32039.00s]  We reached me and beached.
[32039.00s -> 32042.24s]  That fucking, I really thought that's what you linked me.
[32042.24s -> 32043.24s]  And I was like, what?
[32043.24s -> 32044.24s]  Oh, my God.
[32044.24s -> 32046.24s]  That's so fucking funny.
[32046.24s -> 32047.61s]  Star killer.
[32047.61s -> 32049.61s]  Thank you, star killer, for the $1.
[32049.61s -> 32053.56s]  I made this video the night you left and people said to show it to you.
[32053.56s -> 32059.98s]  Let's see.
[32059.98s -> 32073.71s]  I'll stand in my way.
[32073.71s -> 32074.71s]  Here we go.
[32074.71s -> 32077.68s]  Let us see.
[32077.68s -> 32078.68s]  I'm holding away.
[32078.68s -> 32082.07s]  I've got to get it.
[32082.07s -> 32093.08s]  Is near.
[32093.08s -> 32098.84s]  And so I face hurting.
[32098.84s -> 32101.40s]  My friend.
[32101.40s -> 32103.89s]  I'll say it clear.
[32103.89s -> 32106.26s]  I'll state my case.
[32106.26s -> 32108.26s]  It's a lot of money.
[32108.26s -> 32110.26s]  Of which I'm certain.
[32110.26s -> 32116.04s]  I've lived it's full.
[32116.04s -> 32122.04s]  I've traveled each and every highway.
[32122.04s -> 32125.18s]  But more.
[32125.18s -> 32127.42s]  Much more than this.
[32127.42s -> 32137.21s]  I missed that keyboard.
[32137.21s -> 32143.55s]  It was a great keyboard.
[32143.55s -> 32145.55s]  Too few to mention.
[32145.55s -> 32151.18s]  What I had to do.
[32151.18s -> 32153.55s]  And saw it through.
[32153.55s -> 32157.92s]  Without exception.
[32157.92s -> 32162.84s]  Each charted course.
[32162.84s -> 32164.84s]  Each careful step.
[32164.84s -> 32166.84s]  Belong.
[32166.84s -> 32172.86s]  What the fuck was I doing?
[32172.86s -> 32177.52s]  This is my.
[32177.52s -> 32187.79s]  As they'll show you.
[32187.79s -> 32189.79s]  When I beat off.
[32189.79s -> 32193.87s]  Kachoo.
[32193.87s -> 32195.87s]  Alright this is the video's end here.
[32195.87s -> 32199.26s]  Because that was.
[32199.26s -> 32210.20s]  Oh I got it.
[32210.20s -> 32212.20s]  Hahaha.
[32212.20s -> 32269.10s]  That was great.
[32269.10s -> 32272.11s]  Thank you Starkiller2010.
[32272.11s -> 32274.60s]  For that wonderful video.
[32274.60s -> 32280.41s]  Thank you.
[32280.41s -> 32282.65s]  Goodbye old house.
[32282.65s -> 32285.92s]  Goodbye old Massachusetts.
[32285.92s -> 32293.72s]  Welcome to Las Vegas.
[32293.72s -> 32295.72s]  Oh is your twitch just frozen?
[32295.72s -> 32298.48s]  It shouldn't be.
[32298.48s -> 32303.15s]  Give us a link.
[32303.15s -> 32305.15s]  Here is the link to that video.
[32305.15s -> 32307.64s]  I'm leaving Las Vegas.
[32307.64s -> 32309.64s]  That's true.
[32309.64s -> 32311.64s]  Thank you to Darkstar for the $1.
[32311.64s -> 32313.64s]  I think it's time to put your best baby voice.
[32313.64s -> 32315.64s]  And do an AFV style stream for your old YouTube videos.
[32315.64s -> 32317.64s]  Not for a while.
[32317.64s -> 32319.64s]  Maybe someday.
[32319.64s -> 32321.64s]  Butterderp thanks to the $1 for your information.
[32321.64s -> 32324.12s]  I wanted to make sure that it was me.
[32324.12s -> 32326.12s]  Who recommended you play The Sims 4.
[32326.12s -> 32328.12s]  Should I play The Sims? It was me.
[32328.12s -> 32332.91s]  Me. Me.
[32332.91s -> 32334.91s]  Well thank you Butterderp. That was a lot of fun.
[32334.91s -> 32336.91s]  The streams were great.
[32336.91s -> 32339.08s]  Tora T. Tora T. Thanks for the $1. They say seems good.
[32339.08s -> 32341.08s]  Tora gave an absolute
[32341.08s -> 32343.71s]  shitload of community subs.
[32343.71s -> 32347.16s]  Thank you so much Tora.
[32347.16s -> 32349.85s]  You gave a huge amount.
[32349.85s -> 32354.70s]  So thank you.
[32354.70s -> 32358.35s]  It was a crazy, crazy, crazy fucking amount.
[32358.35s -> 32361.10s]  Thank you. So much.
[32361.10s -> 32364.24s]  Dr. Clay thank you for the $1.
[32364.24s -> 32366.24s]  Do you think every time you pick up auto you're playing
[32366.24s -> 32368.41s]  grab that auto.
[32368.41s -> 32370.41s]  Well grab that auto not grab that auto.
[32370.41s -> 32372.65s]  Different words. Different scenarios.
[32372.65s -> 32374.65s]  Wrong screen bud.
[32374.65s -> 32376.65s]  Wrong screen bud.
[32376.65s -> 32384.25s]  There it is.
[32384.25s -> 32386.25s]  Thank you bet3 for the $10.
[32386.25s -> 32389.45s]  Thanks for everything Jerma. We all appreciate you so much.
[32389.45s -> 32391.45s]  Thank you bet3 for your massive contributions.
[32391.45s -> 32395.53s]  Thank you guys.
[32395.53s -> 32397.84s]  Deva Kitty thanks for the $1.
[32397.84s -> 32399.84s]  I just remembered you made a Nidhogg video
[32399.84s -> 32402.20s]  years ago where you played the game
[32402.20s -> 32404.20s]  and me and my girlfriend have had a lot of
[32404.20s -> 32406.20s]  frantic fun playing the sequel.
[32406.20s -> 32408.20s]  So I can very much recommend you play it
[32408.20s -> 32410.20s]  with someone like Italics
[32410.20s -> 32412.20s]  or indeed in the spirit of
[32412.20s -> 32414.20s]  Lethal League reunion with Star.
[32414.20s -> 32416.83s]  Me and Star did play Lethal League and
[32416.83s -> 32419.52s]  Nidhogg 2 does exist.
[32419.52s -> 32423.02s]  It's true. Give it a look.
[32423.02s -> 32426.33s]  Thank you. Thank you
[32426.33s -> 32428.33s]  Synthesis Pandabot
[32428.33s -> 32430.33s]  for the $1. I just remembered you made a Nidhogg
[32430.33s -> 32432.33s]  video. Wrong.
[32432.33s -> 32434.33s]  Wrong. Hey Jerma
[32434.33s -> 32436.33s]  what's going on? It's me Garfield's brother
[32436.33s -> 32438.33s]  Habba Dabba Dabba Dabba

[32490.73s -> 32492.73s]  I'm fine. Just had a small incident when I tripped
[32492.73s -> 32494.73s]  and I fell into my walk-in oven
[32494.73s -> 32496.73s]  and got locked in for an undetermined

[32520.11s -> 32522.11s]  had to write that so it was you. It had
[32522.11s -> 32524.11s]  to have been. Who else could it have been?
