[14.71s -> 19.75s]  Hey, remember me? I'm that guy that's supposed to be live right now for the last two hours.
[19.75s -> 26.20s]  How are you? And look at what it looks like now. Look at how it looks fucking fine. It's fixed.
[27.32s -> 32.36s]  Here's the... Okay, listen, hear me out. I've got to tell you something right now. It's very,
[32.36s -> 42.33s]  very important. You need to hear this. So, plugged in right now is a webcam and there's a USB 3.0 and
[42.33s -> 48.65s]  a USB 2.0. I don't think data was going fast enough into the... I had to put it in 3.0.
[50.36s -> 59.14s]  The same exact thing happened last time. Fuck! God damn it. All right, we're here. Hey,
[59.86s -> 63.06s]  let's turn it off. Let's turn it off with a good look at me. What do you think about that?
[63.06s -> 68.02s]  You can use that one somewhere in your fucking school project. Oh my god, I'm so fucking annoyed
[68.02s -> 74.74s]  and so annoyed right now. And I've moved everything. I've moved everything.
[75.70s -> 84.76s]  There's nothing... Hold on. Let me get this shit the way that it was supposed to be.
[101.82s -> 125.03s]  Dude, you don't know how sad I just was. Do you have any idea of the absolute just sadness?
[125.91s -> 155.70s]  Why is everything shaking? That was weird. How are we? I'm coming for you. You're the one I'm
[155.70s -> 179.69s]  going to get. Bad. Okay, welcome. Dude, I looked over here this way and I see all these costumes
[179.69s -> 187.21s]  and all these devices and all these things to play with. And it's a fucking mess over here.
[187.21s -> 192.73s]  There's like 75 items over here. And then I'm looking over here. There's a door right there
[192.73s -> 201.38s]  and there's a big exit sign. And I'm just looking back and forth like... Oh, fuck me. I am
[201.38s -> 206.74s]  fucked if I can't do this right now. It was like car, bring it back and forth in the car,
[206.74s -> 220.42s]  back and forth. My goodness. All right, here we go. I am going to fix the angle.
[221.22s -> 228.49s]  This is the way it's going to be. I think it's the way this is cut. If you noticed, it's a little...
[230.09s -> 242.81s]  Plus as long as I can stay inside of here. All right, give me my list. Where's my list? Okay.
[242.81s -> 264.01s]  Did I get lower? It's tested. I want to get all tested to make sure everything works good.
[264.65s -> 272.44s]  We got a shadow behind me, but it's kind of... Not much I can do about it. I tried as hard as
[272.44s -> 278.86s]  I could. I got two lights over here. It should be fine. I'm going to go a little bit lower. Let's
[278.86s -> 292.23s]  go a little bit lower. Well, thank you for sticking with me here. Thanks for sticking around.
[293.11s -> 300.76s]  I've just been like... I've just been like mashing my hands together. I almost... I almost... And I
[300.76s -> 310.17s]  don't do this ever. I almost smashed right on the laptop's keyboard. I was like, I'm smashing it,
[310.17s -> 316.09s]  but I was like, no, I don't want to be a baby. That's what babies do. I never do that shit,
[316.09s -> 322.49s]  but I got close. I got close to just healing the thing right on the fucking ground. All right,
[322.49s -> 349.24s]  that looks good. Is it a little too low now? The fuck? Oh, God. Here we go. Hold on, bitch.
[349.40s -> 353.69s]  Remember that joke I said about Bugs Bunny? What does it look like, guys? Let me see. Remember
[353.69s -> 358.33s]  where I did that two hours ago? By the way, did you guys see? I went live accidentally
[358.97s -> 364.54s]  for like 12 seconds. I've been recording and going, but I can't fucking believe I did this
[364.54s -> 376.36s]  last time. You know how it's like... Did you see it? Could you actually see it? Yeah. I think I
[376.36s -> 379.96s]  turned it on and I thought I was trying to record, but I hit the stream button and I think I went
[379.96s -> 387.22s]  like... I was testing the FPS and then I think I said, fuck, and I had a mad face and I turned it
[387.22s -> 406.84s]  off. It's crooked? No, it's not because it's the way that this comes down. I don't think it's exact.
[406.84s -> 422.92s]  I don't think it's perfect because this is... Might as well get started. Yeah. I'm really
[422.92s -> 442.49s]  enjoying the school dance. Should I come a little closer? So do you have any math homework that you
[442.49s -> 460.41s]  have to do tomorrow? Yeah. I have Mr. Stevenson. She's the worst. Yeah. Don't people get... Don't
[460.41s -> 465.53s]  people... I probably shouldn't do that. I probably shouldn't do that. That's probably what not to do
[465.53s -> 470.97s]  because people do that. They record themselves pretending to like... I don't know, hang out with
[470.97s -> 476.17s]  you and talk like ASMR like I'm at the dance with you. All right. ASMR, I'm at the dance with you.
[476.17s -> 487.94s]  I got a list over here. I'm so excited. I'm so happy. First things first. One of the things
[487.94s -> 494.74s]  that people were asking for was a good close-up of my face from every angle. I guess we didn't
[494.74s -> 563.98s]  do it last time. I never realized how fucking ugly you are until you get close. Oh, all right.
[565.13s -> 576.78s]  All right. That's my face from all angles. Look straight. Hey. Hey, how are you? Hey, it's me.
[577.58s -> 580.30s]  Good thing I caught you. Good thing I got you right at the beginning of the video.
[580.94s -> 596.25s]  You're going to want to skip this one because this one sucks. What do you want? What do you want?
[597.35s -> 609.45s]  Good? You got me looking like a nerd neck? Should we do... Wait, how about... Wait, I got one. Guys,
[609.45s -> 616.68s]  I'm going to be here all night. Do you understand how long I'm going to be here for? I actually
[616.68s -> 621.00s]  have to probably make a phone call to the person that runs the studio because I have to say that I
[621.00s -> 627.72s]  am a fucking moron and I have the IQ of a six-year-old and I might be in the DB for a couple hours.
[628.52s -> 637.59s]  All right. What's that? Yeah, they go like this. So this is like a before and after, right? You
[637.59s -> 662.92s]  guys could inflate me. What's next? We're going to do a lot of walking and running routines.
[664.20s -> 693.80s]  Okay, here we go. I forget how to walk. Hold on. What am I doing? Wait, do that again. I'm not
[693.80s -> 724.36s]  listening to music. This is how all ladies fucking... They have the two weights. Give me two weights.
[724.44s -> 746.86s]  Give me two weights. I want this. Here's every old lady during the fucking spring and summertime.
[746.86s -> 788.60s]  Too real? Well, they should be... Okay, got that one. Is he wearing underwear? Wait, did anybody
[788.60s -> 794.04s]  even say that? Did I just make that up? Is he wearing underwear? I think I just made that up,
[794.04s -> 831.14s]  but yes, I am. All right. What's next? Oh, running, running. Okay. Last time I tired myself out before
[831.14s -> 861.88s]  the fucking 20-minute bar. Fucking animal. I don't know. Somebody wanted an animal run.
[862.52s -> 905.61s]  How the fuck do animals do that? How do animals move? Let's solve this. Let's solve this. Oh, dude.
[908.09s -> 915.06s]  Dude, you know those movies? Ever see a movie? When it fucking pops up from the top,
[915.06s -> 946.82s]  it's a boom microphone. Isn't that funny? It's going to be loud. There. Now I got way more room.
[946.82s -> 960.62s]  Okay. What's next? That fly is going to go on. Okay, do the mashed potato. Do the mashed potato?
[963.91s -> 977.46s]  How do you do that? That's this thing, right? Where you go like, bump this song.
[980.79s -> 997.10s]  Mashed potato. You can do the potato. You can do... Shit. Screams over. Do the runescape dances. All
[997.10s -> 1016.18s]  right. Here comes a runescape dance. Runescape dance six. That's for you. Okay. What's next?
[1020.49s -> 1039.08s]  Oh, hiding. Hiding in various places and doing monkey ass. I was spooked.
[1040.36s -> 1045.08s]  I was spooked. I almost did. Thank God I didn't. That would have been embarrassing.
[1053.70s -> 1062.74s]  Oh, the green screen right here. Oh, my God. All my career is over. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What career?
[1062.82s -> 1091.03s]  That's what you're going to... Monkey ass. Monkey ass. Oh, monkey ass. Monkey ass.
[1092.39s -> 1125.00s]  That's bright. Monkey ass. That's the one. Is it hips? What's wrong with my hips? Oh, okay. I like
[1125.00s -> 1212.54s]  this one. Look around like you're speaking telepathically. No, I'm talking telepathically.
[1213.10s -> 1224.74s]  Do you? Hey, this guy's a fucking idiot. This guy's so... Hey, he can't hear me because I'm
[1224.74s -> 1230.57s]  talking telepathically to him so I can talk out loud. I can say whatever I want about this
[1230.57s -> 1243.70s]  fucking asshole. I think he might eat his own shit. I really think he... Oh, hey. Didn't know I was on
[1243.70s -> 1256.82s]  the subway with more than 30 people. I'll make my exit now if you could. Look at me. Somebody
[1256.82s -> 1304.86s]  wants more of these? Sure thing. Oh, excuse me. Those were huge. Laying down from all angles,
[1304.86s -> 1323.51s]  okay. Like just on the ground? Oh, that feels good. Wait, should I put my arms on my sides?
[1331.22s -> 1358.87s]  No, not yet, not yet. Am I supposed to be dead? Oh, fuck you. I was doing something.
[1362.57s -> 1395.24s]  What the fuck? I was doing a pretend butt thing. I don't think any of you knew that I could do this.
[1398.30s -> 1417.86s]  Didn't think I could do that, did you? By the way, I'm so glad that I took a bunch of extra
[1417.86s -> 1455.32s]  strength Tylenol because I'm gonna feel it tomorrow morning. Pretending to shoot a bow. Okay. Wait,
[1455.32s -> 1490.14s]  wait, wait. I gotta hold it. Almost got him. You stay right there, punk. Oops. Ooh, right between
[1490.14s -> 1512.49s]  the eyes. What about you? Got him. Stay there. Stay there. Oh, shoot. It was a boomerang. It was
[1512.49s -> 1557.40s]  a boomerang bow. Don't use that one. Delete that one. It's gotta be from. Yes. What is $12? That's
[1557.40s -> 1576.89s]  right. Those don't cost. That costs way, way less than that. I have 10 of those. Celebration. Look
[1576.89s -> 1586.06s]  at you. Wow. You won. You did it. You get to go up there. God, that looks like fun. That looks like
[1586.06s -> 1613.91s]  a lot of fun. I wish I could get up there. You son of a bitch. Bob, what is $3,200? Wait, wait,
[1613.91s -> 1623.21s]  me? Wait, me? I get it. I get to go up. No way. No way. Right here, man. Ah, fuck you. You're not
[1623.21s -> 1630.17s]  getting a high five from me. Maybe I'll give you one of these. No. No? All right. Really? No way.
[1630.89s -> 1658.82s]  Oh, yes. I'm such a fan. All right. All right. Right. Okay. So I spin the wheel and then I. Okay.
[1659.62s -> 1665.37s]  I just want to say I'm a huge fan of yours. Can I say, can I. Well, okay. You know, I'm really
[1665.37s -> 1670.26s]  sweating right now. So I'm sorry. All right. I'll just. Okay. I'll spin the wheel. I'll spin the
[1670.26s -> 1707.93s]  wheel. You look. Okay. I get to do a hit, right? I lost. I know I can't say that for on TV. Thank
[1708.01s -> 1720.14s]  you. It was a pleasure hanging out with you. Oh, it's broken. Can you just even look at it? It's
[1720.14s -> 1749.26s]  broken. Your shoe is undone. Okay. Moving on. I don't really want to do this one, but I will.
[1750.98s -> 1785.98s]  Should I do this one? This one is pick nose and eat it. Skip it? Should I skip this one? No. Yeah,
[1785.98s -> 1800.87s]  you're right. Nevermind. I bet that's too gross. Okay. Naruto hand signs. From what I know about
[1800.87s -> 1813.72s]  Naruto hand signs. It's this thing, right? Where you go like, boom. I've never seen the show. It's
[1813.72s -> 1828.46s]  like, right? You go like that. Perfect. All right. Let's get some better angles. You catch up to him.
[1828.46s -> 1836.78s]  Oh, wait. I'll catch up to him. I mean, you catch up to him. You catch up to him. I'll take care of
[1836.78s -> 1849.64s]  some stuff. I'll give us a barrier shield. You're all the way over there. Hold on. I got to turn
[1849.64s -> 1860.95s]  this off. No, no, no. I think I just killed an animal over there. Hold on. I'll get you in a
[1860.95s -> 1896.26s]  minute. It's raining. This shoe. Why does it keep... The other shoe. What the fuck? Hug the camera
[1897.14s -> 1915.82s]  and say, hey, chin up, kid. How does that work? Hey. Bring it in. Come on. Come here. Keep your chin
[1915.82s -> 1926.95s]  up, kid. Hey. Bring it in. You and me. I know you. We're going to do it. We knew you were going to
[1926.95s -> 1940.30s]  do this. Yeah. Okay. Fucking. Ooh. Ooh. Hey. Hey, you. Nice work. Awesome. Hey, by the way, tie your
[1940.30s -> 1961.40s]  shoes. I haven't even got the costumes yet. Hey. Why am I addressing with hey? Like, hey. Just do
[1961.40s -> 1970.39s]  it normally. Just come for a hug. How do you... I don't know. How do you give hugs? I don't know
[1970.39s -> 1974.95s]  how you get... How do you give a hug? You people just kind of do that. You just go like, hey, like,
[1974.95s -> 1981.82s]  hi. Nobody comes like this. Like I'm a giant, like Venus flytrap. Fuck, like squish you.
[1983.26s -> 1993.38s]  All right. Let's try one more time. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Hey, you too. Give me.
[1994.50s -> 2005.32s]  Mm-hmm. Ooh. A little tight. Okay. Okay. See you. See you tomorrow. How can I forget you? George.
[2006.20s -> 2016.23s]  George. Yep. Mm-hmm. That was a fun party. That was a really fun party. Next time,
[2017.03s -> 2032.14s]  I'll bring drinks. Delete that one too. What is going on? They said they wanted me to hug people.
[2032.14s -> 2047.75s]  Okay. Transform into a transformer. But you're just a guy. Okay. Omega Tron. We've got
[2047.75s -> 2053.11s]  Decepticons coming at us from two angles. One. Two. I'll make sure to change into my super flying
[2053.11s -> 2092.42s]  jet monster. Jet monster activate. What's his name? Oh, what's his name? Prime. Optimus Prime. Okay,
[2092.42s -> 2106.26s]  that's what it was. Thanks for the wine. Now, this is too many of them. Shell. You go that way.
[2107.06s -> 2129.99s]  Boomstick. Out that way. I'll handle this. I'm the only one that can fly. That was a JoJo.
[2131.58s -> 2149.91s]  All right. How about this one? Time to change. Transformers. Transform into object of flight.
[2151.85s -> 2166.02s]  Ow! Ow! Ow! My fucking bones! Ow! Ah! Oh, it hurts every time. Just like Wolverine.
[2172.66s -> 2202.81s]  Eat this. Decepticons? That's a family guy. This one requires a chair.
[2204.95s -> 2207.67s]  This is play a slot machine from all angles.
[2212.30s -> 2256.38s]  I don't even care if I win. This is the rush of the colors.
[2257.10s -> 2283.03s]  We got any cigarettes, by the way? Yeah, I'll take it back. There we go. Bonus. Come on.
[2283.75s -> 2317.98s]  Come on. Fuck. Thank you. I can bring it over. No, I don't think I know how to smoke a cigarette.
[2317.98s -> 2345.90s]  I'm exhaling while I put, okay. I can't get this. Hope I'm a big winner. Let me put my feet up.
[2349.27s -> 2381.10s]  Ah. That's a pretty good, that's a pretty good view. I don't know what this is. I'm just going
[2381.10s -> 2385.90s]  with it. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I'm a baby in a car scene.
[2385.90s -> 2415.46s]  Perfect. Wow, look. It's a tree. Two trees. Hey, mom. Hey, mom. Mom. Mom. Did you see a tree?
[2418.33s -> 2425.02s]  Hey, mom. Hey, mom. Hey, mom. Where are we going to go to Wendy's? Mom, where are we going to go to
[2425.02s -> 2451.94s]  Wendy's, bitch? Hey. Okay. Hey, dad. Hey, dad. Hey, dad. Control. Why am I a big baby?
[2459.94s -> 2471.16s]  Use the chair like what? There he sits. Fall out of the chair.
[2476.42s -> 2502.94s]  I want to go to McDonald's. Mom, I want to go to McDonald's. Okay. But can we go to
[2502.94s -> 2531.48s]  McDonald's now? Jesus. Slow down. There's a sale on Wendy's. Oh, mom. Mom, you didn't put my seatbelt
[2531.48s -> 2558.87s]  on. In fact, I don't think you've ever put my seatbelt on. Hey, it's me, the Joker. This is a
[2558.95s -> 2583.30s]  fucking terrible one-man show, by the way. The chair? Hey, when we get older, we think.
[2584.44s -> 2595.32s]  Our brains develop, and they reach into us, into ourselves. The great philosopher Galileo once said,
[2596.98s -> 2609.59s]  if I can't see it, then it must not exist. I was 18. I found myself in the high school dance,
[2611.22s -> 2624.86s]  nervous for all of us, except on this particular day. Huh? Okay. We have a guy back here.
[2625.50s -> 2633.21s]  What's that, sir? I'm kind of in the middle of doing something here. No, that's disgusting.
[2633.85s -> 2642.54s]  Can we get security to take care of this guy? Okay. You could be funnier than I am.
[2642.54s -> 2669.14s]  I highly doubt that, though. What are you? Get out of here! Wait, what? Oh, I blocked it.
[2684.63s -> 2703.08s]  It's crazy, people. No, no, no. That's all right. It's all right. So I leaned in,
[2704.31s -> 2708.55s]  and I was going to go. I was thinking about douching. It was my first kiss,
[2709.35s -> 2721.75s]  and it didn't happen. It's okay. I was really in love. I knew it. Just give me a minute. I'm
[2721.83s -> 2728.78s]  kind of winded. You can probably imagine. I'm going to get some water. I'll be back.
[2738.10s -> 2744.54s]  Ace Attorney? Wait, at what point in Ace Attorney does a guy start fighting people with a chair?
[2745.26s -> 2755.03s]  Does that happen in Ace Attorney? I'm going to get some water. I'm going to refill. I'll be right
[2755.03s -> 2811.67s]  back. You never notice how hot hot is until you have lights at every direction pointing at you.
[2812.63s -> 2844.15s]  Moving on. What's next? Oh, yes. Exactly. Yes. I've wanted to do this for a very long time.
[2844.15s -> 2849.88s]  This is the I'm at your birthday party. You can put me wherever the fuck you want.
[2849.88s -> 2860.50s]  I'm going to be at your party. Ready? Actually, I might need this. We'll keep it over here for now.
[2860.50s -> 2878.57s]  Wow. Two years old. They grow up so fast. Wow. Three years old. They grow up so fast. Four,
[2878.57s -> 2887.78s]  you say? Four years old? Wow. Getting bigger, stronger. Five. Five. That's a milestone,
[2887.78s -> 2899.96s]  all right. Five years old. Getting old. He's an old man. She's an old man. Old woman. Wait,
[2901.98s -> 2912.26s]  isn't that Jeffrey's birthday party? Sorry. Six years old. Holy shit. That's ancient.
[2912.98s -> 2926.52s]  You know what I mean? That's ancient. Seven. Seven years old. Wow. Lucky. Seven. Eight. Nine.
[2926.52s -> 2933.16s]  Ten. You're 11. You're 12. You're 13. You're 14. You're 15. You're 16. Sweet. I'm so glad to be
[2933.16s -> 2944.97s]  invited to Your Sweet 16. Mike, Dave, Anthony, Sharon, Crystal, Carl, Matt, who's Tom,
[2946.49s -> 2954.78s]  Jennifer, Jessica. I'm happy to be here. I'm here for your birthday party. Hey, everybody.
[2956.06s -> 2958.78s]  It's blowing out the candles. That's perfect. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2962.33s -> 2967.13s]  So glad I got to go to your birthday party. We're going to have so much fun.
[2968.09s -> 2976.10s]  Everybody's here. We're all here for your birthday. Happy birthday. Hey, guys. Holy smokes.
[2976.98s -> 2987.82s]  It's about to blow out their candles. Everybody get on out here. Go on. Happy birthday to you.
[2988.70s -> 3010.07s]  Come on, everybody. Come on. Happy birthday to you. Happy day, dear, oh. Happy birthday.
[3015.75s -> 3031.43s]  Fucking God damn it. It was so close. It was so close. Everybody gather around. It's about
[3031.43s -> 3041.98s]  to blow out their candles. All together now. All of us. Happy. No, I can't. You do it. I get
[3041.98s -> 3063.51s]  nervous when I'm around a crowd. Happy birthday to you. I'll get it. I need a break. We need some
[3063.51s -> 3080.55s]  angles from back here. To you. Happy. What's this? How does it go? To happy. Oh, I gotta say their
[3080.55s -> 3090.41s]  name. You guys are going to hate this one, but I don't care. If I solidify my online legacy with
[3090.41s -> 3121.94s]  one thing, let's have it be this. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy day, dear.
[3121.94s -> 3133.00s]  Happy birthday to you. All right, that's it. We had so much fun. Wow. Your birthday was a great
[3133.00s -> 3146.06s]  time. Look at what you got for presents. That'll be $200. Thank you. Hey, Jones, blow the fuck out
[3146.06s -> 3165.74s]  of here. That was really, that was probably the worst thing. Oh, wait, what about the chair?
[3165.74s -> 3172.20s]  Wait, it's going to be my birthday. No, not my birthday parties. I'm moving on.
[3182.22s -> 3190.62s]  Who is that? Amnestic O.W. Just gave 40 community subs. Holy shit. Thank you. That's a lot.
[3192.55s -> 3208.02s]  That's so many subs. My birthday's public domain. Yeah, I know. Put your arm around a fake person.
[3208.58s -> 3226.10s]  This could probably be a chair. Hey, just the two of us hanging out, having a good time. You,
[3226.10s -> 3236.68s]  you and me, we're in this together. Always. Right. I know. It's unbelievable. I can't believe it
[3236.68s -> 3247.94s]  either. An asteroid might hit the earth. What? When did you read that nonsense? Uh-huh. Right.
[3247.94s -> 3255.02s]  Oh my goodness. You're the funniest person I think I've ever met. What was that?
[3259.90s -> 3264.39s]  A little too close to the ear. It was loud. So what do you want to, what do you want to go?
[3266.84s -> 3283.85s]  No, no, no, no. Let's not go there. Right. Okay. So, you know, I probably told you that you're my
[3283.85s -> 3298.46s]  best friend. Well, I am. Yes, I am. Sure. Sure. Okay. Over the, yeah. My arm really hurts. We've
[3298.46s -> 3304.38s]  been doing that for like six hours straight and the blactic acid's building up. I kind of just need
[3304.38s -> 3311.00s]  to move. Oh, we're still best friends. We are. We are still friends. Just, I mean, maybe because
[3311.00s -> 3314.60s]  we'll just switch arm. We'll switch. Come here. Okay. Yeah, that's, that's probably better.
[3315.56s -> 3325.27s]  Okay. Yep. Thank you. I don't know why, why do we have to do this? Why can't we just,
[3326.31s -> 3331.40s]  yeah, just stand that way? I just said, in fact, I've always never, I've never been comfortable
[3331.40s -> 3336.44s]  like just like holding onto your like a neck for the last few years. I just, stupid. I don't know
[3336.44s -> 3346.52s]  why we do this. You know how hard it is to put my fucking clothes on? With like, with twins.
[3347.48s -> 3363.67s]  All right. I have no idea if that's what you wanted, but that's what you got. Offer something
[3363.67s -> 3382.34s]  to the camera. This is valuable. Worth a lot, probably. Oh, hey. Would you like one? Here.
[3383.58s -> 3396.02s]  Take one. Only a few of these left in existence. I'm certain of that. And I'm giving it to you.
[3396.74s -> 3408.39s]  That's right. Take it. It's yours. Don't sell it though. I don't know. Don't sell it. Do not sell
[3408.39s -> 3431.19s]  that. Wow. What? You see this? Do you, I don't, do you want it? Here. Take it. Take it. Take it.
[3431.83s -> 3437.99s]  Take this. Take this from me. Take this from me. Take this from me right now. Take it from me.
[3437.99s -> 3441.43s]  Take it from me, dude. I don't want to fucking hold it anymore. Take it from me. Take this thing
[3441.43s -> 3445.35s]  out of my fucking hands before I freak out. Take it from me. Take it. You don't have to take it
[3445.35s -> 3468.01s]  out of my fucking hands. Listen next time. What's next? Skipping, skipping and frolicking.
[3475.24s -> 3480.28s]  Oh, look at the guy with his shoe untied. Every time something happens, he has to bend down and
[3480.28s -> 3485.88s]  tie his shoes because his shoes are like a size too big for him or something. And I don't know
[3485.88s -> 3497.91s]  what that even means. What does that even mean? I haven't skipped since I was probably eight.
[3498.71s -> 3525.91s]  How do you skip? Like this. It's just becoming this. I don't know how to skip. I don't know how.
[3525.91s -> 3545.06s]  I did it a little bit. Somebody said, do the joker's stare dance. Let me just tell you that
[3545.06s -> 3550.84s]  I'm going to be honest. I've never seen this movie. I'm just going to go by what I've seen
[3550.84s -> 3631.02s]  in the trailers. Oscar. Big bits of shit they were. Dude, every year I get older, I just slow it down
[3631.02s -> 3662.46s]  with a Q and B. Jesus Christ. This is a shitload of money. Let me load up the dashboard. Okay,
[3662.46s -> 3674.18s]  first of all, Dr. Noobstein gave a hundred dollars. Can you please say something nice to my nephew,
[3674.18s -> 3683.82s]  Matthew? I'm going to turn into a virtual card for his second birthday. Okay. Wait,
[3683.82s -> 3691.43s]  I got, I did not already get you. Hold on. Hold on. I said Matthew, right? Just in case.
[3694.58s -> 3701.22s]  Matthew. Matthew, it's your birthday. Look at all these balloons. Look at all these balloons.
[3701.22s -> 3705.70s]  There's balloons everywhere. I can't even get away from them. They're just surrounding me.
[3705.70s -> 3712.02s]  Matthew, happy second birthday. My goodness. You're getting so old. You've grown up big and
[3712.02s -> 3717.06s]  strong. Eat your vegetables, especially that broccoli. Wow. What's your favorite color? Mine,
[3717.06s -> 3744.49s]  tween. Stop. You're scaring him. You're scaring him. He's two. You're like a guy like coming over
[3744.49s -> 3755.11s]  like at you. Like that's fucking scary. You're right. That's scary. Hey, hey, Matthew. I heard
[3755.11s -> 3765.54s]  it was your second birthday. Don't give that one to him. Seriously. Don't give that one to Matthew.
[3766.10s -> 3781.88s]  Thanks for the 100 bucks though. That's a lot of money. You're cursed.
[3783.40s -> 3790.15s]  Somebody wants me to do sneezes?
[3804.06s -> 3810.26s]  I'm going to sneeze. I just want you to understand I'm going to sneeze and I don't want you to be near
[3810.26s -> 3822.04s]  me. I'm not held in. No, don't sneeze. Don't sneeze. Don't sneeze right now. Do not sneeze.
[3822.76s -> 3824.65s]  I can't sneeze right now.
[3824.65s -> 3833.98s]  No, people are going to be fucking. How are you?
[3851.26s -> 3867.03s]  Getting close to the props. Oh, all right. Fine. Fortnite default dance. Let's see if I can pull
[3867.03s -> 3882.63s]  this from memory. Isn't it like, is it? That's a single ladies dance. What is it? It's like,
[3886.52s -> 3898.18s]  I'm just going to do orange t-shirt kid. That's the only one that I know. I don't know any other
[3898.18s -> 3980.63s]  dance. I'm like a fly that's getting stuck to a fly trap. Shit. This is bad.
[3992.34s -> 3996.44s]  Sing solid notes. Okay.
[4028.95s -> 4087.27s]  Done. That was good. It's going to go higher. This is fucking stupid.
[4100.86s -> 4112.28s]  How many years has it been since I was last powered on? Two minutes, you say?
[4113.00s -> 4118.04s]  But why do you look so much uglier?
[4134.39s -> 4168.18s]  Get kicked out of the casino. All right. Fine. This thing sucks. This thing sucks. I just put
[4168.90s -> 4176.36s]  $40 in here. What the fuck? Hey, machine. You ever get fucking anything? Hey,
[4176.36s -> 4181.66s]  are you going to pay me some money, buddy? That was really, really bad. I'm going to redo that.
[4181.66s -> 4198.18s]  Let's go back to zero. What's that? $14 down the drain? Un-fucking-believable. Piece of shit
[4198.18s -> 4206.25s]  doesn't pay any money. Doesn't pay any money. Never. Doesn't pay any money. Oh, look, you are.
[4206.25s -> 4211.21s]  You want a jackpot over there? Good for you. Good for you. And what about me? Where's my jackpot?
[4212.01s -> 4220.36s]  What's that? No, I just put $14 in there and I didn't get $2,000 back. What's going on with this
[4220.36s -> 4230.84s]  crap? What are you, dumb? I was just kidding. Look, I put money in here. All right. All right.
[4230.84s -> 4242.33s]  All right. Don't. Okay. All right. Why do you have handcuffs? Are you cops? What? Wait, how did you?
[4243.26s -> 4254.39s]  No, I just put one of my money back. I put $14 in. All right. Stop. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

[4582.23s -> 4587.51s]  My grandmother's address and my grandmother's famous recipe for tomato sauce is two pounds of
[4587.51s -> 4594.26s]  butter. I know it sounds like a lot, but man, why didn't you went right for that? Two pounds
[4594.26s -> 4600.84s]  of tomato sauce, three pounds of sugar. You boil it and then you take it off the fridge for two
[4600.84s -> 4609.22s]  hours. That's the secret. What the fuck is wrong with you? Right here. This is where babies come
[4609.22s -> 4622.20s]  from. And you're gonna do that to me? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Where am I gonna go? Where am I gonna go?

[4969.21s -> 4985.99s]  Let's get on that bus. Okay. Now we have to do one where like my head actually explodes.
[4985.99s -> 4988.55s]  So that's the comedy one. This is the one where like my head explodes.
[5002.50s -> 5009.58s]  There's no way I can get that out of my stomach. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[5009.58s -> 5046.62s]  All right. That's where you, you have to end the video there. That's how you end the video
[5046.62s -> 5088.39s]  with my head exploding. Let me give you a hand. Is this fucking fucked up? I can't tell.
[5095.67s -> 5099.35s]  All right. No, this is like, I don't like that. That's, that's weird. That's like,
[5099.35s -> 5106.07s]  this is fucking twisted. This is twisted. Why am I like getting murdered in a Saw movie?
[5106.07s -> 5112.94s]  I'm putting way too much time into this. Why? Why do I want to get like fucking slaughtered
[5112.94s -> 5127.80s]  on camera? What the fuck? What's wrong with me? One guy said do saw. You got too into the role.
[5130.49s -> 5140.65s]  Do it without the helmet on. The helmet's supposed to crush my head. It's supposed to like squish my
[5140.65s -> 5157.96s]  head. I can't see a goddamn thing. So I cannot even tell if I'm in the right spot. How do people
[5157.96s -> 5171.96s]  wear these? How do people wear these at sporting events? Is it on backwards? I can't see shit.
[5172.60s -> 5185.46s]  You can literally put anything. You can put like a Pillsbury Doughboy's head up here. In fact,
[5185.46s -> 5219.96s]  let's go for it. You can just put the Pillsbury Doughboy. You were too tall.
[5220.92s -> 5237.80s]  Fuck. My scrumptious, my scrumptious croissants will make you and your family very happy.
[5237.80s -> 5274.62s]  Stop. It's cursed. Mega cursed. Mega cursed. Okay. We're not even in the meat and potatoes yet.

[5358.26s -> 5361.38s]  No, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. It didn't sound broken.
[5395.19s -> 5411.83s]  That's not how you lift things. Look at the thumbnail. What's the thumbnail? What's the thumbnail?
[5411.83s -> 5423.58s]  I can't click it. It's going too fast. I can't click it. It's going too fast.
[5426.63s -> 5438.18s]  It's too fast. I can't click it. I'm using a track pad. It's a hostage video.
[5442.09s -> 5446.10s]  Thumbnail. Is it a hostage video? Was it when I was getting into the chair?
[5446.74s -> 5455.75s]  That's the scariest fucking thing. Look at them. You can see like my, you can see my like busted
[5455.75s -> 5484.71s]  up nose through that thing. We had a raid. I can't even see who it was. Who raided? Charborg? Thank

[5492.68s -> 5499.32s]  about two years ago. I got in front of this thing and people made a bunch of really fun shit and
[5499.32s -> 5509.96s]  I'm going to give like five times more footage. Thanks a lot. Welcome guys. It was one year ago

[5838.04s -> 5852.74s]  Lose the shirt. I can't lose the shirt. Oh fuck. Oh man. This is like spilled water on myself. This
[5852.74s -> 5884.49s]  is not even. Oh boy. Hold on. Keep the shirt for consistency. I love her look. Okay. Stare at
[5884.49s -> 6019.26s]  various things with no emotion. Ew. No, that's emotion. Okay. There's your no emotion. Peewee

[6233.88s -> 6252.90s]  Why is that? It's those faces. Choke on a lozenge.
[6252.90s -> 6275.85s]  Choke on a lozenge.
[6288.14s -> 6298.50s]  Take two. Watermelon.

[7239.54s -> 7243.70s]  Did you? You punched him? You punched him in the face? My son doesn't do that.
[7244.52s -> 7254.06s]  Diplomacy only. You know how much trouble I could get in? I'm in the. I'm in the gosh darn.

[7277.48s -> 7286.55s]  You're grounded. We don't fight in this family. Eat your gosh darn. I. I keep saying that stuff

[7371.13s -> 7376.02s]  Where are you going to use this? I don't think there's anywhere it can go.
[7377.11s -> 7383.45s]  You need to put me in a dinner scene. Or I can talk about my son's diplomacy.
[7384.41s -> 7394.44s]  I don't think it's possible to use this. You understand? Good luck. It's just been word soup

[7833.99s -> 7841.42s]  But you'll get to live through the whole series. And there'll be people that use my face
[7842.22s -> 7852.17s]  as their profile pictures on Twitter. I can't wait. I can't. Oops. We were pretty mature on
[7852.17s -> 7867.13s]  that one. Don't want to be evil too quickly. Slytherin me. I believe. So see it's probably
