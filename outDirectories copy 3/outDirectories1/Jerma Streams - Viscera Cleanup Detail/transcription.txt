[1.14s -> 15.53s]  Hello, welcome to another edition of Jeremy plays something and we go what the fuck today's what the fuck moment is
[17.65s -> 33.93s]  Vistra cleanup detail. All right that over here stream detective. Yeah, and I'm sorry to say
[36.25s -> 43.95s]  Today is gonna be a short stream. No, no before anybody gets angry. Just what wait, hold on
[49.18s -> 57.97s]  I need to make sure that the Christmas stream is taken care of I need to get packages ordered
[57.97s -> 64.77s]  I need to get paper and the people that are involved with the project need to be brought up to speed and
[65.57s -> 69.46s]  It's a whole ordeal. So to make sure that I can get that going
[69.46s -> 73.34s]  I've already been doing it kind of today and the day before yesterday
[73.98s -> 79.80s]  So the reason why there's a short stream today is because of the Christmas Eve stream
[79.84s -> 87.42s]  So here I'm gonna give you the plan for the next few days because this is kind of the holiday schedule, right?
[88.85s -> 93.57s]  I got to go to the doctor tomorrow. So that really has nothing to do with it. But the appointment is
[94.29s -> 96.29s]  In the afternoon, so I can't
[96.53s -> 104.22s]  Stream really and it gives me another day to make sure everything can get done. So one two three
[104.30s -> 109.54s]  Here's the schedule for this week. Nothing tomorrow stream on Saturday. Nothing on Sunday
[110.18s -> 117.55s]  Christmas Eve stream on the 24th and then two days later, I'll see you again after the holiday
[117.55s -> 125.76s]  So I'll see you guys probably on like the 26th of the 27th end of the stream voice
[126.48s -> 127.44s]  already
[127.44s -> 130.00s]  No, I mean short as in
[130.56s -> 135.28s]  less than four hours, but more than two, you know, I mean and
[138.19s -> 144.74s]  to continue to talk about this because of the nature of the packages and
[145.02s -> 150.36s]  The secret Santa chat suggestions, I got to get this shit ordered
[150.48s -> 155.78s]  So well, you really only have another couple hours for any suggestions
[155.90s -> 170.94s]  If you have any suggestions on what you'd like me to open on the Christmas Eve stream
[171.26s -> 175.19s]  And I'm gonna break down the rules one more time just because I think
[175.59s -> 179.95s]  There are probably plenty of people that may not know what I'm talking about because they literally only brought it up yesterday
[180.51s -> 185.43s]  So Christmas Eve, I'm gonna be opening up presents from you guys
[185.59s -> 191.43s]  But I'm going to be buying them. I'm not gonna be buying them a third party will be purchasing them
[191.43s -> 194.33s]  I don't know what they're gonna be
[194.33s -> 203.00s]  I don't know what they are your suggestions in that just is the discord channel by the way only up to three suggestions per person
[203.16s -> 208.36s]  Nope, nobody buy it. You don't buy anything. You just give an Amazon link that has a primable
[208.88s -> 214.76s]  Shipping and the mods are going to determine if that would be fun to open or if that would be something that they would want
[214.96s -> 227.82s]  Put on the list up to $50 per suggestion. No more than that. No live animals. No sexual stuff
[228.96s -> 239.21s]  No perishable items. They're your criteria. So no, you're not gonna it's not gonna happen. That's why the mods are
[240.01s -> 246.28s]  Responsible for selecting what they determine to be worth opening. I guess
[249.80s -> 255.96s]  Basically everything hold on. So this so nothing exists. Nothing in the world exists besides bugs
[256.56s -> 260.03s]  rats like dildos and
[261.91s -> 278.73s]  Like sandwiches, are you sure are you sure about this? Nothing else in the world exists. There's no other items. Anyways
[280.15s -> 282.15s]  We're gonna play this or clean up detail
[282.19s -> 286.39s]  Forget it's a just chill game to relax and hang out and play for a few hours
[286.79s -> 291.42s]  Well, then I figure out how I'm gonna get this whole thing put together for Christmas Eve
[291.90s -> 301.42s]  So let's just get over there. What do you say that up should already be
[302.89s -> 310.29s]  Captured. Hey, I think it is. This is not Shrek that I didn't say we were gonna play Shrek immediately
[310.29s -> 314.09s]  I never said that Shrek was gonna be played immediately
[315.01s -> 317.27s]  Shrek is is
[317.27s -> 319.27s]  Why the fuck did I say that last night?
[319.87s -> 328.46s]  why did I say I was gonna play Shrek last night the one where explicitly he talks about a
[330.94s -> 332.94s]  Certain thing a certain
[333.66s -> 336.38s]  sexual
[336.38s -> 337.58s]  thing
[337.62s -> 340.74s]  The first sentence of the game and I'm gonna play that on stream
[341.30s -> 343.30s]  I'm gonna have to like you know, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna
[344.14s -> 353.82s]  He talked like the first sentence of that game was he was talking about like oh, yeah
[353.82s -> 358.54s]  I'm gonna like put on a jacket. Yeah, it's cold outside. I'm gonna put on a jacket
[358.66s -> 363.49s]  You guys know what I'm talking about. Don't pretend like you don't. All right work assignment. I've
[364.07s -> 366.67s]  Split screen solo. Let's just do solo
[367.31s -> 373.81s]  Alone and scared. I played this game years ago a long time ago so long ago
[374.53s -> 377.60s]  Clean up speedrun
[380.81s -> 385.05s]  Worksite, holy shit. I think there was only one place to clean up
[392.38s -> 395.86s]  Save file. I don't have a restore. All right game rules
[396.86s -> 398.62s]  disable sniffer
[398.62s -> 405.99s]  Time limit and footprint limit. All right. I think that's fine
[406.99s -> 409.11s]  Let's listen Athena's wrath
[410.03s -> 413.13s]  average length one hour and 30 minutes

[459.28s -> 461.96s]  Let me go pull on a second
[461.96s -> 465.82s]  Switch game DL switch between this or cleanup detail and its various spin-offs
[466.64s -> 471.16s]  Okay, here we go. So Santa's rampage shadow warrior house of horrors or the Vulcan affair
[471.16s -> 473.16s]  I think I'd have to do the Santa one, right? I
[473.68s -> 486.43s]  Guess we'll try. Do I need to know is this like advanced techniques and stuff?
[486.95s -> 496.37s]  Well, okay. Here we go. Which would you like to apply for?

[576.48s -> 580.59s]  Controls sensitivity, let's get that down to like

[654.98s -> 658.57s]  This is scaring me. Okay
[658.85s -> 666.02s]  Wait, these presents are fine. All right. Let me look at the controls
[666.70s -> 684.14s]  Should have played the tutorial. I really should have this so much here. Okay, should I go play the tutorial?
[684.14s -> 689.31s]  Do I like have no idea what I'm doing? Hold on for a game pad
[690.15s -> 699.88s]  Forward interact is mouse prop and hit is mouse to mop is one hands sniffer is three additional tools
[700.20s -> 703.02s]  All right, I'm gonna go to I don't know what the fuck I'm doing
[703.06s -> 721.14s]  So I need to like I didn't know how to like even play the game. Is there no tutorial? I closed the fucking game
[721.14s -> 724.92s]  It's all right. You just clean up
[727.30s -> 741.78s]  Why is everybody telling me to do the is there even a tutorial clean up this one? You just clean that's it
[741.78s -> 743.78s]  But there's no other that there's no

[899.96s -> 907.77s]  Hey fuck this Xbox. I think I blocked the door. Oh
[915.58s -> 920.70s]  All right, what do I do?
[922.45s -> 935.38s]  It's too bloody I need more water does this work more doesn't work faster. All right, come here put you over here. Oh
[937.06s -> 942.94s]  I feel like you guys are just making me do that. I'm not supposed to be doing that. Just put everything in the fire
[943.58s -> 956.74s]  Okay, everything can go on the fire. That's how you clean the whole house. Okay
[957.60s -> 963.15s]  This is dirty. What do you do with the dirty shit?
[963.75s -> 984.76s]  Okay, I need another one. All right, get out here. Oh and knocked it over. No, I want to give you it
[985.32s -> 1002.49s]  All right, come here right here now. It's clean now. I'm tracking footprints everywhere
[1002.49s -> 1004.49s]  Is this why everyone told me to turn it off?
[1004.53s -> 1007.10s]  How do I clean my feet?
[1007.10s -> 1026.93s]  How do I cook? Okay. All right. I got it clean them. Okay
[1030.21s -> 1032.77s]  Wait, what's that? What do I do with these?
[1033.45s -> 1056.00s]  Can I get like a wastebasket? How do I get like a trash can? This is is a trash can don't like don't tell me
[1056.00s -> 1070.32s]  It's not it just has water in it. Okay. What's this ice cold?
[1070.84s -> 1087.50s]  Is this playing music? How do I make it change songs? How do I make this change music?
[1112.78s -> 1116.23s]  All right, I need to turn this music off. All right, here we go
[1117.60s -> 1129.62s]  Set it on a safe place. Is there how can I rotate something? All right, how do I rotate?
[1130.26s -> 1133.90s]  All right, how do I press the button?
[1134.06s -> 1139.20s]  E
[1139.20s -> 1162.63s]  Hold left click the screen. Ah, I got it. Okay. All right, stop. I gotta clean
[1163.15s -> 1177.02s]  There's a cursor. Oh
[1177.10s -> 1184.93s]  What the this is so tiny. I didn't see the cursor. I thought I had to press the button with my finger
[1185.47s -> 1204.58s]  No, they all start the same way. All right whiskey and a shotgun. Sure. All right, give me my where's it?
[1204.90s -> 1211.92s]  All right. Let me I gotta go. I'm gonna go corner. That's how you clean a real house. You go corner to corner
[1216.03s -> 1220.82s]  And you got to bring the bucket with you so you don't get it anywhere. All right, I'm gonna go corner to corner
[1221.46s -> 1223.06s]  Start in this corner
[1223.06s -> 1228.22s]  Sorry
[1228.22s -> 1232.70s]  Make sure it's all clean in one corner
[1233.02s -> 1239.89s]  Watch your feet. This is the tactic because then you don't step in where you've already cleaned
[1240.49s -> 1251.57s]  And you don't have to worry about anything else. So I didn't know you could do that
[1255.86s -> 1260.73s]  Presence are fine, right? I don't have to get is part of the cleaning. How do I get that?
[1261.21s -> 1279.39s]  How the fuck do I get the kite up on the on the ceiling god, what do you mean gun?
[1279.71s -> 1290.47s]  What am I supposed to do with the gun? I can't use it the FOV. It should be 90 when we turn it up
[1294.02s -> 1295.30s]  95
[1295.30s -> 1302.02s]  Anything over like an 100 is puke inducing. All right, so this corner is done
[1302.54s -> 1320.12s]  Wait, not quite. What's that thing? What a load disposal bins. Ooh, wait, how do I get one? So this is where trash goes
[1320.68s -> 1350.37s]  All right, how much what do I do with this afterwards? I have to throw that in the fire afterwards. Oh bullshit. No, I don't
[1350.93s -> 1365.91s]  Okay, make sure how do I see? How do I stand it back up?
[1366.71s -> 1369.65s]  Shift how do I turn it?
[1372.75s -> 1402.95s]  Turn this I got it. Okay, so you can't just smash into stuff. I get it. God. Oh, okay
[1402.95s -> 1413.88s]  I can hold left click and just turn it on easy. All right. Can I get the fuck out of this corner? I
[1414.36s -> 1423.47s]  Almost got the okay. Remember the technique is corner to corner. I have to be careful
[1424.03s -> 1439.75s]  Alright, so I have to put these in here. Is that the do I get more points if I do it like this in footprints?
[1439.83s -> 1453.72s]  There's nothing even in here. This is dirty. No, it's not. What's the what are the shells coming from?
[1453.72s -> 1458.20s]  Why does this thing have this thing's on a shotgun? Oh, never mind. It fell out before. Okay, here we go
[1458.92s -> 1474.57s]  Don't step in any blood. I gotta get to the front. This is fun
[1474.57s -> 1479.27s]  What if this is kind of like a house flipper, but you don't flip the house. You just clean it up
[1479.97s -> 1490.65s]  This is fun. What was this something wrong with how I said that?
[1491.31s -> 1499.76s]  You don't think this is fun. I think this is fun. It's fun. Can you do my house next?
[1500.74s -> 1506.53s]  I don't even want to answer that because I don't think I'm good enough
[1507.19s -> 1512.14s]  You know, I mean, I'm not sure you want me there
[1512.82s -> 1515.56s]  It'll take me like six hours to clean one room in your house
[1516.22s -> 1520.61s]  All right. What else is in here? All right. Well, that's pretty brutal
[1521.61s -> 1537.62s]  Happy Christmas. So these are as if that doesn't do it. I
[1550.61s -> 1556.22s]  Call it another janitor. Yeah, too
[1560.60s -> 1562.60s]  Okay, so age 19
[1563.16s -> 1570.80s]  Careless work ethic of your predecessor led to their death shaving the company required that you is a substitute this opening immediately
[1573.05s -> 1576.29s]  Perform your duties in accordance with the company guidelines and regulations
[1576.69s -> 1580.67s]  Or be replaced your parts will be valid. Why would somebody do that?
[1581.05s -> 1590.52s]  I'm gonna just take fucking live dynamite throw it into a fire and does it work is my last words. Oh
[1592.34s -> 1594.34s]  Fuck okay
[1597.97s -> 1604.04s]  Is that me

[1618.36s -> 1620.66s]  What are we doing over here? Oh
[1621.50s -> 1623.10s]  shit
[1623.10s -> 1631.88s]  What was that? There was another explosion. Oh, no, what?
[1632.66s -> 1638.49s]  What was the other explosion?
[1641.63s -> 1642.91s]  No
[1642.91s -> 1647.14s]  What was the other explosion?
[1662.90s -> 1669.05s]  This is cleaning up haven't even seen game of Thrones fire. Oh fuck

[1749.70s -> 1751.54s]  Ah
[1751.54s -> 1757.28s]  Okay, let's like all cleaning techniques. You gotta start in the corner
[1763.66s -> 1780.51s]  Give me this. I need a mop up here two hours average. I
[1781.03s -> 1785.63s]  Don't know what the fuck I was thinking. I want to play this game again. This is I like this game

[2091.84s -> 2097.06s]  No, how about this? I'm not gonna turn the stream off until this is clean
[2097.38s -> 2105.43s]  You understand this is gonna be a short stream, but I don't know

[2615.89s -> 2657.14s]  Whatever. Okay, set these back up presents back on the table. All the blood is gone. Is there any blood underneath?
[2657.14s -> 2664.68s]  I don't think there is it's a little bit. Is that blood? No, it's a shadow from the gun. Okay, not bad. Wait
[2665.08s -> 2682.81s]  Okay, take a look at that nice and clean we just need to take this stuff down here to throw it into the
[2683.53s -> 2685.17s]  fire trash
[2685.17s -> 2708.37s]  Use the sniffer. What is this thing trying to tell me? Uh, what does it mean?
[2708.81s -> 2755.42s]  What I mean is there I need the wood planks to go over that hole. Are you sure?
[2755.42s -> 2770.97s]  Uh, is the guns hold on still it's I want to test something here. It is the gun
[2779.10s -> 2785.10s]  It's detecting all the blood below me. Okay. No, no, no, we're fine. There's blood on the ceiling
[2785.58s -> 2806.17s]  Put it put it. I'm not even gonna say what you just said. All right, this is done. What is that? Oh, all right
[2806.17s -> 2819.11s]  I don't want to make sure I don't track any steps. Come here one detects blood and gore the other detects trash
[2819.11s -> 2824.92s]  Okay, I feel like I kind of need to get close to being clean because I mean I will I am
[2825.44s -> 2831.44s]  Have you detecting anything in the room? So I need to clean this up first and then walk around with the ectoplasm gun

[2922.36s -> 2926.20s]  Put the dynamite in the water. I didn't have any buckets of water
[2926.20s -> 2927.56s]  That's why I was calling for them
[2927.56s -> 2930.80s]  I thought you could dump the buckets of water onto the ground to make the ground clean
[2931.20s -> 2938.61s]  All right, the careless of the janitor for the careless with like an ethic of your predecessor. Let it at death. Yeah, it's a shame
[2938.97s -> 2948.70s]  Okay, let's hope I don't get a fucking with a dynamite in the water machine
[2949.22s -> 2952.27s]  No, just more fucking stakes
[2952.91s -> 2958.80s]  Why are you doing this?
[2958.88s -> 2965.54s]  Can I get a bucket of fucking water?
[2966.22s -> 2971.83s]  All right, get off
[2972.35s -> 2975.36s]  No, I don't want more water

[3000.78s -> 3019.18s]  This is how you get extra points, right? Two steps forward. Oh what there was no blood in there
[3019.18s -> 3025.63s]  I was gonna say two steps forward ten steps backwards speaking of steps
[3033.11s -> 3035.79s]  Ruining everything and I like throw this in the air
[3046.24s -> 3054.44s]  Not smashed all that needs to happen is I need to get real close to pick this up and the hand has to fucking
[3054.44s -> 3080.18s]  Grab me. I don't think I'm getting this ever. No, yes, I am. Let's clear the stairs off. All right
[3080.98s -> 3085.06s]  More water, please. Oh
[3085.46s -> 3087.46s]  Like a brain matter
[3087.78s -> 3099.20s]  Water what the fuck is going on? How do you even produce this?
[3099.76s -> 3110.07s]  No, now that is dirty the water fuck am I doing something wrong?
[3114.02s -> 3122.04s]  Finally, the machine is dirty. Well, how would that explain why there's dynamite in the machine?
[3123.02s -> 3138.16s]  Fucking god, damn it. It's fine. There's still what yeah that machines real dirty. That's why it's spawning
[3138.90s -> 3148.84s]  Dynamite. All right. Here we go. Oh, this is really dirty
[3149.36s -> 3153.14s]  Cool. This is oh, this is dirty
[3153.90s -> 3167.48s]  And you put on the ceiling. It's not spawning dynamite. What am I talking about? You didn't see the explosion
[3168.12s -> 3175.55s]  All right upstairs is done. It only took like two hours
[3176.27s -> 3187.07s]  Not the ceiling. Oh fuck
[3187.71s -> 3207.30s]  Dammit, okay, make sure I think I got it all what the hell is this trash? All right. I gotta get rid of whoo. I need that
[3224.45s -> 3229.42s]  Well, all right, so I'm sorry I didn't know that was gonna turn into a fucking Simon Belmont item
[3229.68s -> 3244.33s]  There's a Castlevania. Holy water. I didn't know that was what was gonna happen. I thought it was an LED. All right, the machine is clean
[3251.38s -> 3254.06s]  Yeah
[3254.06s -> 3272.56s]  I'm gonna clean the machine and then let's see if your guys theory is correct. Okay machine is now clean
[3273.16s -> 3283.22s]  Whatever fuck. Okay. I have a clean machine
[3283.82s -> 3287.46s]  Now, let's see if if I get more body parts
[3287.70s -> 3302.52s]  So it was bullshit doesn't matter if the machines dirty or not that wouldn't produce. Why does it keep getting worse?
[3302.68s -> 3304.68s]  Am I getting bad grades or something?
[3305.32s -> 3321.36s]  Okay back up here. This is done. No more blood on the ceiling pick this shit up
[3326.67s -> 3327.95s]  Yeah
[3327.95s -> 3332.17s]  Yeah
[3332.17s -> 3333.37s]  Okay
[3333.37s -> 3349.43s]  Now I didn't need a new I did a new bucket of water. I'm sure you didn't want an arm now
[3349.43s -> 3361.84s]  Well, I'm overwhelmed. I'm okay. I'm done. That was fun. I'm just kidding
[3362.24s -> 3371.58s]  So what I don't even start I don't know even where to start with this. What are all these buckets doing down here?
[3371.58s -> 3376.44s]  Oh, I don't know what to do. This is so much
[3376.44s -> 3382.41s]  It's so much that it's overwhelming to me corner to corner just like my true strategy
[3382.85s -> 3389.04s]  Okay, let's do this. Correct. I'm gonna burn the buckets
[3389.64s -> 3400.05s]  I'm starting from scratch. I don't even care what that is. It's just it's in my way
[3400.69s -> 3403.65s]  Fuck the stools. I don't I just need space
[3404.41s -> 3426.95s]  Get over here. No, I need that nice. It's this too many things in there all presents are gonna have to move into a corner
[3427.39s -> 3447.61s]  There's a radio. Yeah, I got ridder. Okay. No, there's more buckets. Can I like put these in here?
[3448.25s -> 3470.32s]  What happened? Oh, all right. I get it. I can't so what happens if this goes back in there?
[3470.32s -> 3483.95s]  Let me just I'm testing something. Hold on. Does this take the trash as well?
[3484.39s -> 3506.62s]  Okay, you have to burn it, but I didn't know if you could fill it and then bring it over there and it like
[3506.62s -> 3510.14s]  Oh, thank you. It sucks it back up and empties it without having to dump it into the fire
[3510.82s -> 3527.85s]  Okay, here we go. This is new. He's trying to tele-frag himself. I mean not really
[3527.85s -> 3533.32s]  I didn't know if there was an in a quicker way to instead of dumping it into the fire
[3533.90s -> 3545.68s]  Corner to corner. Let's go. I do need that though. No, so I don't even care what it is
[3545.68s -> 3548.94s]  I'm not if it's a present who gives a shit. It's going into the trash
[3555.65s -> 3568.06s]  Fuck well, that's to go up there. Perfect about this. This is oh my god. Damn it
[3571.50s -> 3581.72s]  Nothing fell out. It's so easy just to accidentally. This is just look at this physics thing the game
[3582.28s -> 3585.02s]  What does this stuck on? On the hat?
[3585.54s -> 3594.21s]  Okay, I just it's flat man. Just what am I sitting this on? What's wrong with this? A bullet?
[3598.49s -> 3600.49s]  more body
[3600.85s -> 3601.93s]  parts
[3601.93s -> 3615.01s]  Yeah, I'm sorry that gets caught up in the crosshairs. I don't care if it's a nice candy cane. It's going to the trash
[3615.53s -> 3620.42s]  It's not my job to have to worry about what can or can't be thrown away right now
[3620.86s -> 3640.18s]  The fuck is this thing? All right body parts in in
[3640.94s -> 3644.79s]  In all right, we're pretty we're kind of full
[3660.76s -> 3664.92s]  All right, I got it
[3665.92s -> 3671.04s]  So do I leave that in there
[3671.08s -> 3675.93s]  Or do I don't understand? Do I leave the incinerator in there or do I have to take it back out?
[3676.45s -> 3680.22s]  Just leave it in there. Okay. I didn't know if I was
[3680.82s -> 3697.33s]  That's fine. I need another one. All right. Now I need a bucket of water joint
[3697.97s -> 3702.17s]  Look at that, you know, if I think I was gonna get anything done today, did you?
[3702.81s -> 3720.87s]  Zero progress look at upstairs. I did all of upstairs already. I took care of upstairs. I got started down here
[3721.31s -> 3725.15s]  This is how long it would take me to clean an actual house
[3725.59s -> 3742.27s]  I'm gonna here's where I'm gonna store all the flash drives over here in this corner one small part of the map in an hour
[3742.27s -> 3745.22s]  There's not much left
[3745.22s -> 3760.98s]  Fucking footprints. I need more water. All right. I need to how do I reliably dump this in the fire?
[3760.98s -> 3771.22s]  I think yeah, I have to just put it in the fire. I can't do anything else with it. All right now I've got a flow
[3771.82s -> 3782.31s]  Now I got a fucking flow
[3782.31s -> 3789.32s]  This but bought downstairs here is gonna be a breeze
[3789.84s -> 3793.62s]  All right, what time is it right now?
[3793.62s -> 3795.62s]  I've been streaming for an hour and four minutes. I
[3796.74s -> 3798.74s]  guarantee I
[3798.78s -> 3803.64s]  100% guarantee that this area down here will be
[3804.50s -> 3807.50s]  Immaculate in exactly 20 minutes
[3808.10s -> 3809.57s]  Okay
[3809.57s -> 3816.64s]  So at exactly one hour and 24 minutes into the stream. It's going to be immaculate down here. Go
[3817.22s -> 3832.75s]  Check this out. I got a fucking better idea. I know what I'm gonna do
[3833.33s -> 3863.31s]  Watch this. I need like five of these. Okay, that's good for now one more
[3866.97s -> 3906.74s]  Here we go. Fuck. I still got it. It's fine. Nice spill joke. No, not everything is a spill joke
[3907.26s -> 3934.27s]  Time check I don't need that one. It's fine. I got obviously that's even two minutes
[3934.77s -> 3953.24s]  Relax. I got this ten minutes left. No, I have like
[3954.14s -> 3974.84s]  Seventeen minutes left that bring this closer. Don't waste any time with the incinerator thing. There's no reason for it
[3974.84s -> 3993.86s]  Okay, candy can't get in there all things must go once the blood is gone. It's just a matter of getting three incinerators
[4002.94s -> 4004.78s]  Dirt, okay
[4004.78s -> 4018.30s]  Getting there. I'm not gonna lie. I would probably sit here with my mouth open and play like the ten hour long level. I
[4021.07s -> 4022.39s]  Really would
[4022.39s -> 4026.07s]  Is it too early to call this game of the year?
[4026.59s -> 4031.10s]  No, no, not too early. It's fucking two weeks till the year's over
[4031.74s -> 4037.36s]  You know what? I mean though. Is it do one of this come out like five years ago?
[4038.06s -> 4054.34s]  I'm a couple of years too late. Well, can I amend my taxes from two years ago and make sure that I put game of the year?
[4054.38s -> 4062.46s]  2015 as visceral cleanup detail. Is that bad? I put that off my taxes
[4062.98s -> 4073.61s]  Yeah, that one was on purpose because I thought it was funny
[4074.13s -> 4084.12s]  That's just gonna shoot does the gun shoot if it's in there. This is like a cartoon. This is like a cartoon
[4084.12s -> 4086.12s]  That's gonna go like
[4086.16s -> 4089.59s]  Right
[4089.59s -> 4091.23s]  Okay. No, it's not
[4091.23s -> 4135.17s]  Where was the blood where the blood come from get rid of the oil? How am I gonna get that? Okay, good clean no blood
[4135.87s -> 4142.99s]  little bit of blood
[4142.99s -> 4148.26s]  All right, almost there. Oh my god. I got about 14 minutes. Oh
[4152.68s -> 4174.54s]  Dear not gonna track this around. I don't care. I don't care

[6768.59s -> 6770.75s]  What are you talking about? It's gonna be some food
[6775.18s -> 6778.14s]  All right, the text to speech is over. I'm turning it off
[6780.76s -> 6782.76s]  I gotta get out of this fucking room
[6783.88s -> 6785.88s]  Fucking he oh he swears
[6787.44s -> 6797.10s]  What's wrong with me?
[6797.10s -> 6799.74s]  No, it's not on there. Why do I think it's on there?
[6807.76s -> 6810.16s]  All right, give me the incinerator thing
[6811.90s -> 6814.86s]  Give me a new one. I want a clean slate. I don't even know what's in there
[6819.92s -> 6822.68s]  This room is done
[6822.68s -> 6824.68s]  Let me pull out the
[6824.84s -> 6826.20s]  the meter
[6826.20s -> 6835.15s]  What is up here?
[6835.15s -> 6836.59s]  Oh right there
[6836.59s -> 6848.72s]  Is that it? I think it's detecting the shit downstairs
[6856.46s -> 6864.83s]  You finally noticed the green poop it's called the sniffer get the names right
[6865.79s -> 6867.79s]  All right. I'm gonna move on
[6868.27s -> 6870.91s]  This room is pretty much done. I'll figure the rest out later
[6871.79s -> 6873.31s]  I need a new bucket
[6873.31s -> 6877.23s]  Let's get rid of the old buckets. Wait a minute. That's not a red lamp post
[6877.95s -> 6885.39s]  Now it is
[6885.39s -> 6887.39s]  End of the stream voice not even close
[6901.13s -> 6903.61s]  Oh my god, why am I doing that?
[6905.68s -> 6907.76s]  I have the memory of a fucking goldfish
[6909.50s -> 6912.06s]  I'm gonna pick this up and put it over here. Okay
[6912.94s -> 6914.94s]  That thing no longer exists
[6920.12s -> 6923.56s]  Has it been more than five seconds item doesn't exist anymore
[6924.28s -> 6928.27s]  Two will be fine. I think
[6928.27s -> 6945.13s]  Okay, don't knock that over two will be all right
[6946.09s -> 6948.09s]  Now I need to get one of those
[6948.48s -> 6954.06s]  trash compactors
[6954.06s -> 6956.32s]  What is this?
[6956.32s -> 6965.53s]  What is this? You just
[6965.53s -> 6974.56s]  This is the bat I think it's the bat
[6975.52s -> 6978.52s]  Was there bat in that game? I don't remember who that was. No it
[6979.32s -> 6982.14s]  Bowser Jr
[7000.38s -> 7002.41s]  A boomer game
[7002.41s -> 7004.41s]  How dare you say something like that?
[7005.32s -> 7007.32s]  Yoshi's island is
[7007.64s -> 7019.44s]  Is is the history of all video games? I need
[7020.72s -> 7022.72s]  Oh, what do I need?
[7024.46s -> 7028.78s]  This is an achievement that said 28 000 of something. I don't even know what it said, but that's a lot
[7028.94s -> 7031.10s]  There's no blood over here. This thing's pretty clean over here
[7036.59s -> 7038.99s]  What the fuck happened in here? Did the grenade come in here?
[7039.87s -> 7049.68s]  I think so
[7049.68s -> 7052.96s]  That's not gonna fit like that. I'm gonna have to do individual pieces of wood
[7058.41s -> 7060.41s]  A grenade walked in here
[7061.88s -> 7063.88s]  Yeah, so I mean like what the fuck
[7065.45s -> 7077.74s]  Get out of my space, man
[7077.82s -> 7079.82s]  I need to get this is not gonna happen
[7080.88s -> 7083.87s]  It's too clunky
[7083.87s -> 7091.87s]  too clunky
[7092.59s -> 7103.20s]  Too clunky
[7103.20s -> 7112.40s]  How am I gonna get all this out of here? I think I have to make another pile no
[7113.36s -> 7117.82s]  Give me the bucket
[7118.30s -> 7124.62s]  I think I have an idea
[7124.62s -> 7133.20s]  It's kind of that's not a bad idea
[7133.28s -> 7137.63s]  Just knock it all in the corner over there
[7138.27s -> 7154.97s]  Now that loosened it up. That didn't do anything. I need to hydrate
[7157.36s -> 7159.36s]  Um, it's been two hours
[7160.08s -> 7162.04s]  I'm all right
[7162.04s -> 7169.16s]  I drank I already drank a lot of water. I'm all right
[7169.80s -> 7173.21s]  Appreciate the concern
[7173.21s -> 7175.21s]  Fuck you. Did that really just happen?
[7175.21s -> 7181.60s]  That's mopped up
[7181.60s -> 7183.60s]  Nothing else in the corner. I don't think
[7184.40s -> 7187.90s]  except for the table
[7187.90s -> 7190.70s]  This water is absolutely filthy
[7193.68s -> 7199.79s]  Time to get rid of this water
[7199.79s -> 7201.63s]  drink drink drink
[7201.63s -> 7207.08s]  fine
[7207.08s -> 7226.72s]  There's extra like fucking protein cells in there. It's the bonus room where you spin the wheel
[7227.28s -> 7232.06s]  Okay
[7232.06s -> 7243.00s]  Why do you just have to ruin everything with the meat here?
[7243.56s -> 7252.35s]  Is this clown music? I mean it technically is clown music carnival music
[7254.89s -> 7256.33s]  Technically
[7256.33s -> 7258.33s]  All right. What are we at? We need
[7258.73s -> 7260.73s]  I need to get the stools out of the way
[7261.45s -> 7263.45s]  No, it's just it's just brush
[7264.17s -> 7266.41s]  Pick up the bodies after just it's spelled. You got a brush
[7267.13s -> 7272.28s]  Because then I got a clean slate and it's just picking stuff up and moving stuff around
[7272.84s -> 7280.14s]  Just don't hit the bodies because it spreads blood like that
[7280.78s -> 7284.24s]  Debris is fine. I can just mop around it
[7284.80s -> 7300.83s]  Debris and blood is more debris
[7301.92s -> 7304.24s]  Now it's time to actually pick shit up off the ground
[7304.88s -> 7312.62s]  This is super mario gets the star
[7313.34s -> 7316.80s]  I don't know what the fuck it's doing in a yoshi game
[7322.43s -> 7324.59s]  All right. I think I can bring in a barrel
[7329.69s -> 7331.69s]  Because yoshi is part of the mario universe
[7332.97s -> 7339.96s]  Oh, yeah
[7339.96s -> 7345.05s]  Nice ad
[7345.05s -> 7347.77s]  I can't even see the sour please gift. Yes, I can
[7348.33s -> 7356.56s]  I told you my new year's my my new year's resolution is i'm going to download better twitch.tv
[7361.63s -> 7365.23s]  These are just too big. I gotta go by themselves. They can't fit in the box
[7367.44s -> 7371.60s]  But hey that there's the joke though guys because new year's resolutions you never do them
[7379.34s -> 7381.74s]  All right. I think the rest can fit in a box
[7384.22s -> 7392.89s]  Yeah, give it to me. This is the final boss, right?
[7398.78s -> 7400.22s]  body parts
[7400.22s -> 7402.22s]  This is going pretty smooth
[7410.49s -> 7414.81s]  These old electric guitar song the sounds that like
[7419.77s -> 7435.68s]  You know how long it probably took somebody to find or make that electric guitar sound
[7436.48s -> 7449.52s]  Sounds like a mega man
[7449.52s -> 7451.52s]  Well, they are from the same era
[7459.36s -> 7461.84s]  Not gonna fit but I will try to balance it
[7462.56s -> 7473.34s]  Don't have this guy
[7473.34s -> 7476.49s]  You know what I mean fortnight they don't have this kind of music in fortnight
[7477.29s -> 7493.61s]  Why does everything relate back to fortnight?
[7494.01s -> 7500.59s]  Because I believe at this point there are more followers to the fortnight
[7501.63s -> 7502.67s]  twitter
[7502.67s -> 7504.67s]  Than members of christianity
[7506.59s -> 7522.91s]  So, I mean it's pretty relevant
[7522.97s -> 7525.55s]  Jesus fortnight. No what i'm saying is
[7526.78s -> 7528.78s]  Fortnight has become so big
[7530.04s -> 7532.04s]  It's like minecraft times five
[7543.28s -> 7550.38s]  How many followers does the fortnight twitter have i'm curious and this is just the twitter account
[7553.52s -> 7556.72s]  six and a half million
[7556.80s -> 7559.20s]  How many how many people follow christianity?
[7560.00s -> 7561.90s]  like eight million
[7561.90s -> 7565.80s]  four million
[7565.80s -> 7570.28s]  It's like it's like probably a billion. Fuck. It's like two billion people
[7573.80s -> 7575.16s]  All right
[7575.16s -> 7578.86s]  So i'm gonna do a google search is fortnight more popular than christianity
[7598.33s -> 7600.64s]  fortnight
[7600.64s -> 7602.64s]  Yeah, only 6.5 million people
[7603.20s -> 7605.84s]  Follow the twitter, but how many people have installed the game?
[7609.23s -> 7615.95s]  Somebody give me some facts on that how many people have installed fortnight. I'm talking across mobile. I'm talking on desktop
[7628.86s -> 7632.38s]  over 200 million
[7632.38s -> 7643.24s]  Okay. Oh, we've been new ost new ost. Hold on
[7652.56s -> 7663.39s]  Chrono trigger, this is a good one. This is a really good one one of my favorite games ever made in case you're curious
[7678.38s -> 7688.40s]  Resident sleeper on chrono trigger what chrono trigger is an awesome game
[7693.48s -> 7696.52s]  Oh, I mean you that's a real quick way to get fired from chat
[7712.30s -> 7727.61s]  Anime game. It's not it's not an anime game. It is what do you mean? It is. Yes. It is. No, it is not
[7730.96s -> 7736.24s]  Just because toriyama did the fucking slides doesn't mean that it's an anime game
[7750.17s -> 7764.11s]  Fuck that i'm taking up later. All right, i've made no problem. Yeah, I have look at this turn it up my pleasure
[7777.29s -> 7783.82s]  Is something oh no, okay. I thought the game crashed here's a fun fact about chrono trigger and uh a stupid dumb
[7784.52s -> 7786.49s]  moronic fact
[7786.49s -> 7790.97s]  Uh, they've re-released this game probably twice the amount like probably more than skyrim
[7792.06s -> 7794.14s]  Just make another one
[7794.14s -> 7795.36s]  Do it
[7795.36s -> 7797.92s]  You you had fucking god. Damn it
[7798.40s -> 7804.17s]  just make
[7804.17s -> 7811.05s]  Just make another one. What's stopping you? You know chrono trigger and chrono cross. They're such everybody loves them
[7811.53s -> 7814.65s]  They're like more loved than final fantasy seven
[7815.77s -> 7818.49s]  But let's let's bring the final fantasy seven three times
[7820.91s -> 7823.47s]  No, no, no, don't do it. There's only been two chrono games
[7824.28s -> 7826.78s]  Make another final fantasy
[7826.86s -> 7828.86s]  Quick do it rich 17
[7832.06s -> 7841.98s]  Oh my
[7844.51s -> 7848.03s]  I'm so i'm so flustered right now for a fucking chrono trigger
[7849.76s -> 7852.16s]  They had an opportunity. They had it trademarked
[7853.77s -> 7855.77s]  But they were like no, you know what oh
[7857.85s -> 7861.20s]  Hmm
[7861.20s -> 7863.20s]  Okay, I moved it over there. So it is
[7863.60s -> 7869.92s]  Chrono for smash
[7869.92s -> 7875.20s]  I don't know if that would ever happen. Isn't there a bunch of weird legality around the entire chrono franchise?
[7875.92s -> 7880.00s]  Not like five people tied to its inception and like that's why it's impossible to do anything with it
[7880.64s -> 7883.92s]  Just think this one's fine. What's wrong with this one? Nothing. Whatever
[7893.88s -> 7895.40s]  they made
[7895.40s -> 7898.28s]  Yeah, they yeah, they made fortnight instead of uh chrono break
[7901.16s -> 7903.16s]  Chrono cross was messy
[7904.68s -> 7906.68s]  But it was still a great game
[7908.48s -> 7910.48s]  You wanted something crazy about chrono cross
[7910.72s -> 7912.72s]  Why that game was so fucking cool?
[7912.96s -> 7914.08s]  they were
[7914.08s -> 7915.96s]  40
[7915.96s -> 7919.96s]  Playable characters and they're more than I think like 45 playable fucking party characters
[7922.76s -> 7926.04s]  That's just I mean, it's it didn't suck. It didn't suck. It was messy
[7926.84s -> 7928.81s]  It was messy
[7928.81s -> 7935.16s]  But it didn't suck
[7935.16s -> 7938.76s]  It really did suck
[7938.76s -> 7942.84s]  yeah, but if they had if if chrono break tied the whole series together and they made like a
[7943.40s -> 7948.12s]  Bring back like chrono bring back frog or you know, glen spoilers everybody. Sorry
[7953.21s -> 7957.05s]  Boomer rose tinted glasses. No, no, no, no, no go play chrono trigger right now
[7957.61s -> 7961.18s]  Do it right now close the spring
[7961.42s -> 7965.10s]  It's on every platform. Don't worry. You'll find it type in what platform is chrono trigger run for me
[7965.66s -> 7971.93s]  Chrono trigger is one of the best games ever made
[7972.65s -> 7976.17s]  Just do it right now. It's gonna take you like 30 or 40 hours to do
[7976.73s -> 7980.03s]  Put it on your christmas list. Don't worry. I just threw this in the
[7987.56s -> 7989.88s]  Stream chrono trigger, I I know I can't
[7995.00s -> 7999.32s]  Boomer streamer thinks the game he played when he was five is a good game. Oh, you guys have no idea
[8001.45s -> 8003.53s]  You have no idea. Come on. Are you serious?
[8006.35s -> 8010.51s]  This game is a cloud. The story is wonderful. It was about time travel
[8011.39s -> 8015.31s]  And like fucking up the future and fucking up the past. It was oh it was perfect
[8021.52s -> 8025.38s]  Anime plot this shit predated anime. This was like 1994
[8029.10s -> 8033.18s]  It predated all those terrible netflix original animes guys. Come on
[8049.44s -> 8053.84s]  Oh, no, here comes the chat for anime netflix. I mean i'm joking but you know what I mean
[8060.06s -> 8063.66s]  Yeah, what animes did we have back in like the 60s and 70s? We had speed racer
[8065.90s -> 8068.38s]  And then like dragon ball was made in like 78
[8070.46s -> 8076.10s]  And then chrono trigger
[8076.10s -> 8077.94s]  the pokemon
[8077.94s -> 8080.42s]  And the cura came out and that would mean that was wild
[8087.31s -> 8089.55s]  And then minecraft came up and changed everything
[8094.42s -> 8096.48s]  Whoa
[8096.48s -> 8103.12s]  A new item
[8103.12s -> 8118.40s]  What is this? I don't understand what this does. Is this just a better mop? This thing sucks. Am I using this wrong?
[8131.88s -> 8134.83s]  Broomer, I know it's a broom
[8135.57s -> 8139.25s]  Stop calling me broomer. Did anybody say that or did I just make that up?
[8139.97s -> 8143.89s]  I don't know. I'm like i'm having a paranoid moment here
[8146.56s -> 8153.47s]  No one said that
[8153.47s -> 8155.47s]  All right. I gotta pay attention. I have
[8155.55s -> 8165.23s]  He thinks he's streaming again. Jeremy, you gotta wake up. You think you're streaming
[8174.69s -> 8176.69s]  Compact broomer
[8180.34s -> 8185.62s]  I'm just so clumsy. I don't do this in real life. Just because my video game character has like a fat stomach
[8186.10s -> 8187.14s]  Okay
[8187.14s -> 8191.38s]  I think this room is pretty much good. Just a little bit more cleanup and we can go down to the basement
[8194.38s -> 8199.50s]  Wake up. Jeremy. It's been five years. I mean you I saw you in the other chat doing that a year ago
[8200.22s -> 8223.42s]  You know, I think i've seen you in that in another chat doing that. It's part of the dream. That was part of the dream
[8227.15s -> 8228.91s]  Get out of my fucking way
[8228.91s -> 8238.16s]  Who's the first person to call me a boomer? I really wonder
[8238.96s -> 8241.73s]  Who started that?
[8241.73s -> 8250.16s]  Yeah
[8250.16s -> 8267.78s]  How many tickets did you guys get when you played this level?
[8277.81s -> 8286.99s]  Max stack. Yeah, maybe the soundtrack alone will make some of you, uh
[8291.30s -> 8296.98s]  No, i'm not gonna keep pushing that i'm not gonna keep pushing like the boomer millennial thing. It's a great game
[8296.98s -> 8298.58s]  It's got a great soundtrack
[8298.58s -> 8302.02s]  Made by some of the most brilliant minds that are still making games
[8304.90s -> 8316.78s]  In the industry somebody said this the soundtrack the soundtrack is very meh
[8317.34s -> 8338.11s]  I want that person banned for life
[8338.11s -> 8340.11s]  Yeah, if you don't know what a lifetime ban here is
[8340.94s -> 8354.85s]  10 seconds the zoom beanie ost is better than this
[8355.57s -> 8363.71s]  Are you okay? Is the streamer taking drugs or is the chat member taking drugs? I'm not sure. No, I am sure
[8363.79s -> 8366.67s]  I'm not on drugs. So let me you know what I was going with that
[8380.88s -> 8387.98s]  Oh my god, god damn it. I don't take any drugs
[8391.30s -> 8394.34s]  Unless you count like Tylenol or caffeine
[8395.65s -> 8410.11s]  Sometimes this one was perfect. I think it's just music. It makes me really productive
[8416.21s -> 8418.38s]  Jenga
[8418.38s -> 8436.88s]  Oh, there's the magician inside that uh, little tent area. I don't actually know that this is uh,
[8436.96s -> 8438.96s]  This is the robot that you have to beat up for tickets
[8441.55s -> 8443.55s]  I love reminiscing about this game
[8445.46s -> 8446.98s]  Yeah, it's el gato
[8446.98s -> 8454.46s]  I said it's the robot that you beat up for tickets. I know what it is. I've played i've beaten this game 30 times
[8455.54s -> 8466.05s]  Is for as many years i've been alive beat it on stream
[8468.27s -> 8469.87s]  Maybe I would one day
[8469.87s -> 8472.03s]  but turn-based rpgs on twitch
[8473.18s -> 8477.92s]  I'm not sure how uh, i'm not sure how people will take that
[8478.48s -> 8488.69s]  I feel like it's a very like you got to be like known for that, right?
[8489.41s -> 8495.73s]  How many of you guys would want to sit through a me to play a full turn-based 60 hour rpg?
[8501.33s -> 8504.19s]  Really sure
[8504.19s -> 8508.99s]  Are you guys sure I played octogen for two days and you guys were trying to fucking
[8510.91s -> 8522.11s]  scream in my face
[8529.78s -> 8531.94s]  Don't octogen was fun. It was
[8532.74s -> 8534.74s]  That was a fun little game
[8539.09s -> 8541.97s]  All right. I think we're good in here
[8541.97s -> 8543.97s]  I'll do a final check later
[8545.33s -> 8548.69s]  See any of the blood down to the basement we go after I burn
[8556.21s -> 8558.37s]  If people watch fortnight, then people will watch anything
[8565.65s -> 8567.81s]  Yeah, but you understand like you guys
[8568.61s -> 8570.61s]  Don't want to watch fortnight
[8570.61s -> 8572.61s]  Oh god. Damn it. I don't have any water
[8575.38s -> 8577.38s]  No, not my gifts. Oh, come on
[8578.02s -> 8580.02s]  I just did this room
[8587.94s -> 8589.94s]  No, what the hell?
[8590.42s -> 8598.34s]  uh
[8598.34s -> 8602.30s]  This room is completed
[8602.30s -> 8607.42s]  Are you saying we wouldn't watch you play fortnight? Yeah, maybe it's like a joke for an hour
[8608.98s -> 8610.98s]  If I turn the stream on tomorrow
[8611.22s -> 8612.58s]  Oh, hey guys
[8612.58s -> 8616.66s]  So i'm going a different direction with the channel here. I'm gonna be playing fortnight three days a week
[8618.85s -> 8620.85s]  75 percent of you would leave
[8624.45s -> 8626.29s]  We've already talked about this
[8626.29s -> 8635.42s]  You know how many fortnight channels I already exist
[8636.70s -> 8639.14s]  What do I bring to the table?
[8639.14s -> 8643.22s]  Whoops, I got a headshot in the very beginning. I was player number 97
[8644.34s -> 8645.30s]  I'm out
[8645.30s -> 8648.82s]  You know, let's do that like 35 40 times
[8649.54s -> 8656.64s]  I can't believe this happened
[8656.64s -> 8665.54s]  I'm not gonna be better than everybody that plays
[8666.82s -> 8668.90s]  I don't i'm not like i'm not into br
[8669.62s -> 8674.29s]  It's uh, it doesn't doesn't do it for me

[8739.09s -> 8741.44s]  If you think it's fun, i'm glad you do
[8741.44s -> 8745.63s]  But that's I can't I can't play the other games

[8828.62s -> 8830.64s]  Get off of me
[8830.64s -> 8832.64s]  Get off of me
[8833.84s -> 8839.04s]  Why?

[8907.18s -> 8910.34s]  I don't think so
[8910.34s -> 8913.54s]  I just got big burnout the day the funk died
[8915.82s -> 8917.82s]  Oh, it's because I broke the boombox. Okay

[8926.74s -> 8929.14s]  Okay, would you guys be upset if I played this game way more?
[8935.54s -> 8936.50s]  because

[8947.97s -> 8949.89s]  It's something very therapeutic
[8949.89s -> 8954.03s]  And we could talk about fortnight
[8954.03s -> 8956.19s]  That went in my eye that went in my eye
[8956.83s -> 8959.58s]  Am I wearing glasses? I hope so

[8981.36s -> 9008.78s]  Okay, that's better
[9008.78s -> 9013.84s]  Because now I can still fit stuff in it
[9014.00s -> 9016.00s]  We got a reindeer body
[9016.00s -> 9018.50s]  I'm gonna have to shake it another time
[9023.30s -> 9040.43s]  There's a battle theme battle theme. All right. I don't want to track dirt. Hold on
[9052.93s -> 9065.94s]  Got a lot of glass noises. Ah, it's all right. This is a really weird ride for this guy
[9070.43s -> 9076.16s]  Okay, I didn't track any dirt. What are you talking about? We're good. All right. I need another one

[9160.18s -> 9168.94s]  Is that thing gonna be fine? All right anymore reindeer
[9169.87s -> 9172.85s]  Antlers. Yeah, I gotta get rid of these. We're not gonna fit the box
[9173.49s -> 9188.50s]  I'm making a mess
[9188.50s -> 9193.30s]  Well, I have I have to make a mess first down here before I because these are gonna I have to take these one by one
[9193.70s -> 9195.46s]  They're not gonna fit in the box
[9195.46s -> 9199.02s]  And i'm trying to jump to not track this blood everywhere
[9199.82s -> 9202.13s]  Which i'm not this is the last piece

[9234.00s -> 9236.82s]  I don't even need a box. I got one right here
[9237.97s -> 9239.97s]  Where did this come from? When did I bring this down?
[9240.61s -> 9246.69s]  Okay, reindeer chunks
[9246.77s -> 9261.10s]  Okay
[9261.10s -> 9264.62s]  I think that okay, that's already done for me. See
[9265.50s -> 9267.50s]  that bucket's already full so we're gonna
[9268.14s -> 9271.58s]  Stick with that kind of theory here and just put fill these buckets
[9272.46s -> 9273.98s]  and then we have
[9273.98s -> 9276.06s]  Smaller amount of things to take up
[9276.78s -> 9279.73s]  Let's see if I can stuff him in here
[9283.58s -> 9286.54s]  No, just put him in the big one really fit in the big one
[9305.26s -> 9319.76s]  Upside down get in all right. That's as good as it's gonna get so you can fit in here. What is all this?

[9459.95s -> 9467.14s]  What was the estimated play time for this one four or five hours? I did it in like three
[9473.22s -> 9474.66s]  What the fuck?
[9474.66s -> 9483.30s]  Okay, and we just got the little nerf pellets. I gotta bring this over here. It's gonna be paying the ass

[9495.15s -> 9500.91s]  But not a real boss fight. This is like a a mid-level boss
[9507.52s -> 9520.10s]  Not to be confused with a real boss. You'll know what that is when you hear it really
[9530.40s -> 9542.94s]  Uh, where'd it go? Okay. Well, whatever it's time to stop mopping
[9544.22s -> 9549.65s]  back wall

[9577.54s -> 9580.02s]  Unless you that are curious. Why am I the dj?
[9580.66s -> 9583.54s]  And coming up next we have frog song from uh chronic trigger
[9584.34s -> 9586.82s]  This song played when anytime frog was on the screen

[9647.90s -> 9665.04s]  I need a few of these
[9666.32s -> 9670.45s]  I forgot I had this here. It's all right. I packed it so well then nothing's gonna fall out
[9681.07s -> 9685.39s]  uh fun fact, uh, that was frogs theme turning into uh victory or uh
[9687.39s -> 9720.69s]  Hold on the court. Uh, I need to get everything empty from here. Let's take this because this is just one bucket
[9721.57s -> 9744.48s]  I was holding shift and
[9744.88s -> 9748.16s]  This whole thing is dumping out god give me a break
[9748.80s -> 9750.16s]  Oh
[9750.16s -> 9754.72s]  It's because I was holding shift and I was being careful. I should just fucking walked out
[9755.36s -> 9765.38s]  so if I was doing a speed run, uh speed runners of this game if that just happened would you would that be like a
[9766.18s -> 9768.18s]  fuck reset moment
[9776.06s -> 9778.06s]  And the reset would be really quick too. It would be like
[9778.54s -> 9782.99s]  And they're starting again. It'd be like click click click click click click and do game
[9791.01s -> 9804.10s]  All right. Um, let's get this out of here. I'm walking. I'm not running. I'm walking
[9815.68s -> 9818.94s]  All right, give me another one. Give me another bucket. I want two

[9821.74s -> 9825.52s]  Incinerator
[9825.52s -> 9828.40s]  And I have to use this right now because of this stupid shit here
[9828.96s -> 9832.56s]  They give you the zombie parts. I just want a thing to put people in
[9833.20s -> 9850.78s]  The finish line it is inside. Nobody said that but the finish line is in sight
[9853.47s -> 9856.67s]  Stop the stream. I'm trying to eat
[9856.67s -> 9858.67s]  So good luck with that right now
[9858.75s -> 9873.20s]  still eating
[9873.20s -> 9875.36s]  That was real. I don't know why I'm sorry about that
[9876.00s -> 9878.00s]  I'm sorry
[9878.96s -> 9883.14s]  This just think of it like this this is just barbecue
[9884.43s -> 9887.95s]  See that's barbecue sauce. This is like a nice spare rib
[9888.51s -> 9890.99s]  Well, there's like a chunk of brisket. Just think of it like that
[9891.71s -> 9895.26s]  See, this is spare rib
[9895.26s -> 9901.79s]  Okay off screen like look at it off screen if I told you that this was forget about where we can see the hand right there
[9902.35s -> 9907.57s]  If I told you this was like a nice barbecue spare rib right now. Look at it like right there
[9908.29s -> 9915.36s]  You wouldn't be able to know what if you were vegan? Well, then you wouldn't be eating it. Anyway
[9915.60s -> 9929.33s]  It's the courtroom part two. All right. I fucked this all up because i'll be an idiot
[9930.05s -> 9937.98s]  I'm just in one of those moods today for some reason
[9943.47s -> 9945.47s]  All right, let's take this downstairs
[9952.26s -> 9954.37s]  People are eating
[9954.37s -> 9956.69s]  Well every time there's something gross on the screen. Just look away
[9957.57s -> 9972.67s]  Yeah, can I just put the whole fucking bucket in there?
[9978.35s -> 10018.50s]  All right. Oh, can I stack the buckets in each other? I gotta weigh it down. I'm walking
[10018.82s -> 10047.58s]  Okay, watch out for this watch out for that perfect. All right, let's go back to what I was doing down here
[10048.14s -> 10052.16s]  It's a new bucket of water
[10052.16s -> 10054.72s]  And then I can do the final pass through that's got to go
[10056.26s -> 10058.66s]  That's gonna get me points docked if that stays down here
[10064.34s -> 10067.92s]  Uh, just you stay down here for now
[10073.81s -> 10075.81s]  This is in the future as it happens and get to the future
[10076.53s -> 10099.57s]  All right looks pretty clean back here except the bucket. Okay
[10103.44s -> 10104.96s]  Right, that's there

[10176.59s -> 10177.87s]  to put
[10177.87s -> 10181.39s]  Some small remaining stuff in like these flash drives
[10182.11s -> 10185.57s]  And i'm gonna dump them in front
[10185.81s -> 10187.17s]  the front door
[10187.17s -> 10202.40s]  That's gonna give me some points
[10210.21s -> 10212.38s]  Okay, where's that bucket?
[10212.70s -> 10214.62s]  This is too dirty
[10214.70s -> 10216.06s]  Yeah
[10216.06s -> 10221.10s]  I can't put the bucket in here. Shit. It's so I gotta walk back

[10229.17s -> 10231.17s]  We're on crunch time here now
[10236.83s -> 10239.76s]  If I spilled this i'm gonna be very upset
[10240.48s -> 10245.58s]  See that doesn't count. It's inside the fire
[10247.71s -> 10252.10s]  What else is down here?
[10252.10s -> 10253.81s]  Okay
[10253.81s -> 10255.81s]  Need to get this out of the way
[10256.13s -> 10258.93s]  There's no more items
[10258.93s -> 10270.37s]  I need a bucket. Hey, look, it's a bucket. I need it right here
[10271.09s -> 10281.07s]  Only the final room is the entryway and then I can clock out
[10281.63s -> 10297.95s]  I'll dump that in there. Just turn it upside down and i'll throw this away
[10298.75s -> 10305.71s]  I can't
[10305.71s -> 10307.71s]  I jumped over it. See? All right, here we go
[10317.98s -> 10319.98s]  Uh, i'm gonna leave that one for trash
[10320.54s -> 10322.54s]  Because they're probably stray trash
[10322.86s -> 10351.25s]  Where's my bucket?
[10351.25s -> 10354.00s]  I did it. I didn't spill it
[10354.72s -> 10360.99s]  Okay
[10360.99s -> 10363.95s]  Down here and then just clean up the blood and that should be it
[10364.75s -> 10366.61s]  And I can do the final room
[10366.61s -> 10370.72s]  Hopefully there's not that much where I need a second bucket, but there probably will be
[10371.60s -> 10379.84s]  It's already getting a little dirty
[10379.84s -> 10381.84s]  Shit, i'm gonna need another bucket. Ah
[10382.72s -> 10392.50s]  Or am I?
[10392.50s -> 10394.82s]  Hmm. It's yeah. Yes, I do

[10445.89s -> 10450.21s]  On the table I knew there was dynamite in there but the one on the table to the right
[10455.54s -> 10458.82s]  I knew there was dynamite in that one. That's why I did it but I thought
[10459.70s -> 10468.59s]  How are you supposed to get rid of those?
[10468.67s -> 10473.15s]  Script a joke. No, I knew there was dynamite in there. I said it as I was walking up
[10473.87s -> 10479.39s]  But so if you put dynamite in the water, but then what happens when you throw that in the trash?
[10480.03s -> 10482.03s]  Okay, hold on if you put dynamite
[10482.27s -> 10486.32s]  In water and then you put the dynamite into the fire. Doesn't it just blow up?
[10487.04s -> 10502.19s]  Just don't throw it away. No, it doesn't it doesn't no. I knew I put the dynamite in that one
[10502.19s -> 10504.19s]  I just didn't know if it was gonna
[10504.27s -> 10506.27s]  Set off the why am I putting this over here?
[10507.07s -> 10512.06s]  Not a controlled burn in the trash
[10512.22s -> 10515.06s]  Why would that happen?
[10515.06s -> 10517.38s]  No, he fucking scripted it. Oh, it was scripted
[10528.96s -> 10531.20s]  See he knew that was gonna happen and that's why he did it
[10533.04s -> 10537.76s]  Notice the frame notice the frame right before he puts look I froze it here
[10538.00s -> 10541.44s]  Notice the frame right before he walked forward. He glanced to the right a little
[10542.00s -> 10545.04s]  To make sure that he was in line of sight for the other explosion
[10545.20s -> 10547.20s]  And what he did is he then he made sure he was close enough
[10547.44s -> 10551.60s]  And then he stepped a step to his right to make sure he got blown up. I I recorded it and I saw it
[10552.77s -> 10553.89s]  uh

[11370.69s -> 11372.69s]  Next slide, please
[11372.93s -> 11381.78s]  I think we're running through like a rough patch right now. Sometimes it happens. It's eggnog. Yeah, but eggnog is
[11382.40s -> 11386.77s]  Alcoholic is it non-alcoholic eggnog?
[11389.12s -> 11391.68s]  But yeah spaz that you've you've given so many
[11395.57s -> 11398.91s]  Yeah, sometimes you get a rough patch. The internet was fixed
[11399.31s -> 11400.19s]  uh
[11400.19s -> 11402.69s]  Like a month or two ago
[11403.39s -> 11408.99s]  But sometimes it still does happen. Sometimes it's a little dip that lasts probably five to ten minutes and then it smooths up
[11409.95s -> 11413.84s]  Usually unless something else went wrong, but I don't think so
[11414.48s -> 11414.72s]  All right

[16851.07s -> 16853.24s]  curb your enthusiasm is

[16873.61s -> 16874.85s]  especially
[16874.85s -> 16877.45s]  Especially curb your enthusiasm starts off kind of slow
[16878.01s -> 16882.09s]  You're gonna be like, this is not funny. You're gonna watch like the first four episodes and go. I don't like this
[16882.09s -> 16884.09s]  This is stupid. Don't don't do that
[16884.57s -> 16892.24s]  You got seasons like two through eight of curb your enthusiasm is some of the most hilarious television I've probably ever watched
[16893.04s -> 16907.98s]  Every first season of a TV show is weak. I stopped in the first season hypo
[16907.98s -> 16912.10s]  Yeah, but that that's what I mean. The first especially the first couple episodes is just
[16912.74s -> 16918.50s]  Like oh, there's like two guys kind of arguing with each other. That's like the whole episode. Okay. Well that
[16919.10s -> 16928.50s]  This so there's so much more after that first season, especially the first few episodes skip the first season

[17142.37s -> 17146.85s]  Thanks to the $1. Do you dream of twitch chat? I've had dreams of twitch chat before
[17147.37s -> 17155.93s]  I've actually think I've had a dream before where I was sleeping just in my bed and I was just seeing
[17156.61s -> 17160.85s]  Kind of the chat on the right side of in of just meet like, you know
[17161.01s -> 17166.57s]  I'm lying there with my eyes closed like it's all it's all black and I just see twitch chat on the right and it's just
[17166.57s -> 17171.17s]  Like he doesn't know he doesn't know what the fuck. Oh my god. What an idiot somebody text him
[17171.17s -> 17176.85s]  Anybody have it like it was that just spamming and there were like 30 or 40,000 concurrent people there and
[17177.33s -> 17181.25s]  I was like wait a minute hold on. I had like an internal panic. I'm like, wait, I'm sleeping. They're watching me sleep
[17181.29s -> 17189.66s]  How did I delete the stream on now? I'm sleeping and then I realized what was happening
[17189.66s -> 17196.78s]  But that's probably the only thing that's happened because then I'm thinking about like it
[17196.82s -> 17199.50s]  What do I have any clothes on like how many people are here what's going on?
[17200.18s -> 17205.64s]  Why is the stream on him? Why am I why am I asleep? What what's going on?
[17206.24s -> 17215.96s]  But yeah, Freudian weapon again. Thank you for the $1. Honestly, I would watch you play through anything RPGs, especially
[17216.64s -> 17220.56s]  Maybe persona 5 someday hashtag charity. I don't think so
[17222.10s -> 17226.62s]  I've never played a persona game before and I feel like starting at persona 5 is the equivalent of
[17228.09s -> 17229.29s]  watching
[17229.29s -> 17232.19s]  like
[17232.19s -> 17234.19s]  like watching Star Wars
[17234.35s -> 17240.21s]  That's like watching the new Star Wars movie before you even know what Star Wars. I guess I'll watch this
[17240.73s -> 17242.33s]  episode 7
[17242.33s -> 17259.51s]  You can't really do that. It doesn't matter. So they're not they're not connected at all. They're all self-contained except for the first two
[17259.51s -> 17275.39s]  Oh, oh, okay. Oh, there goes the one of the reasons then I actually saw on the ps4 store when I was browsing
[17277.85s -> 17282.68s]  There's a persona 5 dance game because that's what I thought it was at first
[17282.72s -> 17287.76s]  It was like persona 5 dance in the starlight or something and I'm like what the fuck why people like this game so much
[17287.96s -> 17290.44s]  It's like is there like a
[17290.44s -> 17295.08s]  This is a RPG, but just like a dancing simulator. I thought that's what persona 5 was
[17295.64s -> 17304.56s]  Because it's persona 5 like colon. Here's like a little tagline. I was like, okay, that's that's persona 5
[17305.04s -> 17316.72s]  So how so there's a there's also I saw persona 4 like dancing with the stars, right?
[17317.16s -> 17326.42s]  Cuz I got really confused and I watched the trailer
[17327.64s -> 17333.96s]  Everybody's like oh you gotta play persona 5. It's got such an engrossing story. It's like such an interesting game. It's so great
[17333.96s -> 17338.04s]  Oh Joker, and then I'm watching this trailer for the people. It's like a
[17338.68s -> 17341.32s]  It's like a DDR. I'm like, this is what okay
[17341.88s -> 17355.80s]  But I guess I mean I I've seen persona 3 be played and it was pretty interesting
[17356.32s -> 17364.27s]  I never played him myself though. Hey radio video. Thanks for the one dollar German
[17364.27s -> 17366.99s]  We we will watch you whatever you stream because we love you
[17367.23s -> 17379.60s]  Those stuff like Chrono Trigger would be good for chill streams. Yeah, I know I probably will end up playing it
[17379.60s -> 17386.29s]  I probably would stream it. It's a great game
[17386.81s -> 17394.70s]  But alas, I would watch it. Well, that's good. I am monk
[17394.70s -> 17398.36s]  Thanks for the dollar 72 can't give subs, but here's some bits

[17436.40s -> 17438.40s]  I'm gonna spill the bucket over
[17438.68s -> 17445.04s]  Accidentally, I mean, okay sure, but if that happens like two or three hundred times
[17445.80s -> 17451.28s]  Does it do you think that at like not time number 300? I'm like, here we go. Here comes a funny thing
[17451.28s -> 17458.22s]  I'm gonna do yeah, this would be funny when I do this after like 200 times
[17458.86s -> 17467.05s]  No
[17467.21s -> 17472.34s]  There are certain things that I maybe I would

[17494.00s -> 17504.08s]  That's the same thing to fall off the horse thing. I do you think I'm making a joke after 75 times?
[17512.24s -> 17517.49s]  It's funny because I played Red Dead Redemption 2
[17518.13s -> 17524.39s]  Like two nights ago when I wasn't streaming I was just hanging out on the couch and I fell off more times
[17524.71s -> 17528.87s]  Than when I was streaming and I'm a little laughing to myself going like man
[17528.87s -> 17531.55s]  If only people were watching this they would be like, holy shit
[17532.15s -> 17539.59s]  without us
[17539.59s -> 17549.16s]  Yeah, I maybe I would stream Red Dead again, but I'm just I'm having fun. Just slowly going through on my own

[17557.44s -> 17567.11s]  No, I streamed Red Dead like five times
[17567.11s -> 17577.60s]  I played about 30 or 40% of that entire game on stream that into the whole thing, but I mean, it's a long game

[17892.09s -> 17896.18s]  You you got a lot to go through
[17896.46s -> 17904.00s]  But I think ashen would have to sit sort of on the back burner
[17904.60s -> 17908.36s]  Because that's a big commitment. Isn't it? It's a
[17909.08s -> 17912.00s]  It's not is it a long game. Is it was it like 30 hours or something like that?
[17912.64s -> 17923.22s]  20 30 40 hours was it short 20 hours
[17923.70s -> 17931.21s]  Yeah, but I've probably sit on the back burner. I don't have any plans for it not in the immediate future, but it is always there

[18106.58s -> 18107.82s]  kind of
[18107.82s -> 18115.94s]  Scatter it. He'll look into it. I've done that before
[18116.74s -> 18119.48s]  It's just I'm so bad
[18119.88s -> 18128.26s]  You know it took me it took me like there's like this guy in the stream and chat and he hangs out a lot
[18128.74s -> 18131.18s]  he was a college roommate of mine and
[18132.96s -> 18141.13s]  He's like he proved it. It was real and it took me like four to five straight months to remember. Oh, okay

[18187.88s -> 18198.23s]  Check exactly that when the stream ends. So it's okay. I'm just making it funny
