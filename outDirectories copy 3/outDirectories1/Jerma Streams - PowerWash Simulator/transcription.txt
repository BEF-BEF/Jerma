[9.91s -> 21.43s]  I am on time. I am on time. I'm here. Clock. By what time it was. It was ready to go.
[21.43s -> 23.59s]  And I freaked out and I was like, I have to press the button right now.
[26.10s -> 34.54s]  And landed on its side? What does that mean? Hello though, how are you?
[35.26s -> 38.86s]  Why do I feel like I'm so- I'm really tall right now. I need to- there we go.
[39.99s -> 41.83s]  My chair booster thing was up high.
[44.55s -> 50.81s]  The air thing that makes you go higher or lower. Anyways. Hello?
[50.81s -> 57.16s]  Today we're going to play Power Wash Simulator. The game that I've been talking about for a long
[57.16s -> 68.78s]  time. And look it, we're finally going to do it. In a booster seat is confirmed funny. All right,
[68.78s -> 119.75s]  let me just tweet this out. I'll be right back. Give me a second. There we go. I might- you know,
[119.75s -> 126.15s]  I might have to take- I might- I'm going to take a Tylenol. I woke up with a headache today. I need
[126.15s -> 130.89s]  like a- like ibuprofen or something. You know when you have that wicked bad headache brain?
[132.70s -> 138.92s]  Anybody else get this? Or your- like your head hurts. So therefore like words coming out is- comes
[138.92s -> 144.20s]  out slower. Like I'm talking right now, but there's- it's going through like a headache filter. You
[144.20s -> 151.50s]  know what I'm talking about? I hate that. Give me one more second. I'm going to take Tylenol.
[151.50s -> 232.79s]  I'll be right back. Also, I feel like I'm way too close, yet way too far away from the screen at
[232.79s -> 241.30s]  the same time. This is not right right here. Hold on. You know, I let Bugleberry borrow some of my
[241.30s -> 249.37s]  audio equipment and some of my monitors. He didn't- he returned them wrong. Move this back.
[249.37s -> 261.27s]  That's better. Stalling. All right. Everything's too close to me. Get away from me. All my things
[261.27s -> 269.14s]  are too close. I need to be sitting far away from my screen. He didn't change the category?
[269.14s -> 280.92s]  What? I'm still in hot tubs? What? No, I'm not. I hope not. My go live notification is Bugleberry's
[280.92s -> 284.84s]  cauldron? No, no, no, no. Fix that. Change that. That's not what I want.
[290.90s -> 297.19s]  He just does it again. Oh, dear. Okay. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[297.19s -> 309.69s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. Career of ruining error. Oh, God. Oh, hey. Hey, Regan.
[310.98s -> 318.94s]  Thank you, Regan, for the end community subs. Appreciate it. And Farz. Thank you, Farz. One,
[318.94s -> 325.18s]  one, two, two, three. The community subs as well. Not- this is not a hot- I mean, there's no camera,
[325.18s -> 331.08s]  right? No. Where's the- there it is. We're doing Power Wash Simulator. I can't wait. I'm really
[331.08s -> 340.36s]  excited about this game. I thought this game was a joke. I willed this game into reality in my brain.
[340.36s -> 345.48s]  Now I know that that seems incredibly egotistic and an insane narcissistic thing to say,
[346.20s -> 350.50s]  because this game's probably been in development for like a year or two. But if you remember,
[350.50s -> 356.17s]  six months ago, I was like, man, if there was only a game that you could just wash it and clean
[356.17s -> 365.14s]  stuff. And I could put my fingers on my head and I squeezed. In my brain, I willed this game into
[365.14s -> 381.00s]  reality. That's not accurate, but here it is. Okay, yes. Do I even have audio? I do. Oh, there's a-
[381.00s -> 387.35s]  this is- I don't- I've never played. We're gonna do career mode. We can't hear you. Yes, you can
[387.35s -> 396.78s]  hear- I can see the indicator. Uh, clean the van, this first one. Great news. Finally found a van
[396.78s -> 401.02s]  for you at one of the auctions under your budget. Don't freak out when you see it. It looks like
[401.02s -> 406.31s]  it's just been dredged from the bottom of a lake. Oh, I can't wait. But that's a good thing. It meant
[406.31s -> 411.90s]  no one else bid on it. They missed out. Underneath that hideous layer of gunk is your perfect
[411.90s -> 415.82s]  workhorse. Engine's a dream. No rust. There's even equipment in the back. Just needs a good
[415.82s -> 421.05s]  hosing down and you're in business. You'll certainly earn your pressure washing stripes
[421.05s -> 427.93s]  getting this thing clean because of- oh, there's a five-star rating and you earn money. This- okay,
[427.93s -> 434.07s]  I'm gonna- let's just be really, really clear. This- when did this game come out? This year?
[434.07s -> 439.05s]  Was it 2020 or 2021? When did it actually- well, is it- is it out or is it in early access?
[439.05s -> 455.62s]  I'm too quiet. Really? It shouldn't be. Hold on, let me see. Does the mic change? You know,
[455.62s -> 463.37s]  you let Bugleberry borrow shit and all of a sudden look what happens. How about now? Is that better?
[463.37s -> 468.92s]  Is that better? We good? I think this is where it was before. It got changed. I think we're good.
[471.98s -> 477.53s]  This might be the best game of the year for me. We'll find out. You guys ready?
[479.99s -> 484.39s]  Sound like Bugleberry. That was very loud. I'm really glad you didn't have to hear it.
[484.39s -> 491.91s]  All right, select nozzle. Raise lower tablet as escape. Okay, selecting nozzle. Select extension.
[491.91s -> 499.77s]  Select soap. There's different soap categories. Inventory. Rotate nozzle. Refill cleaning fluid.
[499.77s -> 507.67s]  Show dirt. Walk, crouch, jump. Oh my god, there's way more going on in this game. Let me turn the
[507.67s -> 514.92s]  volume down. It's probably really loud. Actually not that bad. Show dirt. I am. Is it an IDFOV?
[514.92s -> 534.41s]  Is it an IDFOV? No, here we go again. Is this an IDFOV? What do I do that? Control sensitivity.
[534.41s -> 543.62s]  Controls. I think it is. All right, let's do it. So, uh, this sensitivity is way too high.
[549.26s -> 557.43s]  Way too high. Controller sensitivity. Oh, this is gonna be on console. All right, that's fine.
[557.43s -> 562.94s]  So what do we do? Spray? All right, just like strip the paint. That was way too much.
[563.90s -> 577.22s]  Oh my god, that's loud. Hold on. If you did that to a car, you would rip the paint off. All right,
[577.22s -> 582.74s]  the ambience is fine. The power washer needs to come down. Water reverb. Turn the reverb down.
[582.74s -> 591.03s]  All right, there we go. That's fine. I think that should be good. That's better. Oh my god,
[591.03s -> 603.59s]  I love it. How do I change nozzle? Oh, I only have the stubby gun. 15 degree, 25 degree, 40 degree.
[603.59s -> 610.76s]  All right, this actually might be like the best game ever. This is what you, this is the one I
[610.84s -> 616.50s]  watch. I watch so many videos of people doing this shit. You have no idea. Guys, I will open
[616.50s -> 624.71s]  up a power washing video or like a wood cutting video and just let shit autoplay for hours. I
[624.71s -> 629.22s]  actually have a quick story for you. We're talking about autoplaying and maybe think about it. Um,
[629.22s -> 635.61s]  so like a week ago, like a week ago, I was watching TV and we're gonna go into a story here.
[639.24s -> 645.94s]  What's wrong with my voice? Hold on. We're gonna go into a story. Uh, so I was autoplaying videos
[646.58s -> 653.14s]  lying on the couch and I don't turn autoplay off. I know I just turned it up, but I always forget
[653.14s -> 656.66s]  to. And for some reason I'm never logged into YouTube, never logged in. I'm never logged into
[656.66s -> 663.77s]  any service. So even if I change it, I'm not going to be logged in the next day. So it doesn't matter.
[663.77s -> 670.28s]  So I'm on the couch lying down. I just had a big meal fucking Burger King. Just kidding. It was
[670.28s -> 679.48s]  McDonald's. I don't eat Burger King. And I fell asleep on the couch to autoplaying videos and I
[679.48s -> 688.07s]  believe it was cooking stuff. So I woke up maybe 20 minutes later and I was in that mode in my
[688.07s -> 694.22s]  brain where I just, I could not move. You know, you just, you just don't feel like it. Nothing will
[694.22s -> 699.02s]  make you get up besides like a fire alarm, right? Just like, I don't care what's happening. I don't
[699.02s -> 709.26s]  care what sounds are playing. I'm just going to keep sleeping. So I heard counting. It was like,
[709.26s -> 718.55s]  oh, like 2,448. 2,500. Who the fuck is counting? And I just went back to bed. I was like, I don't
[718.55s -> 722.31s]  care. I don't care to turn it off. I don't even know what it is. So I got up with like a second
[722.31s -> 727.51s]  or third time and I looked up and I was like, what is it? Why is Binging with Babish on the TV?
[727.51s -> 735.45s]  And I hear 30,345. I thought I was Binging with Babish doing like a counting video. So I was like,
[735.45s -> 742.76s]  I don't, I don't care. And I went back to sleep. And then later on, like the next day, I was like,
[742.76s -> 751.02s]  I'm curious, like what the fuck was that? And I watched on autoplay asleep, the entire Vsauce
[751.02s -> 756.82s]  Michael prime number video. It's like a four hour video. He says every single prime number up to
[756.82s -> 764.34s]  like 40,000. And it woke me up like three times. And each time I'm just like, shut the fucking
[764.34s -> 773.64s]  counting. Stop counting, please. But I was too lazy to actually get up. So I had, I feel like that
[773.64s -> 781.58s]  like gave me like a headache or something. It may have changed me forever. And I don't know why we
[781.58s -> 789.38s]  do that shit. Why do we do that shit to ourselves? And I, did you hear Otto? Let me get Otto.
[789.38s -> 817.64s]  Otto! It has to be a scientific reason for it. But the act of waking up like 20% the halfway,
[817.64s -> 823.03s]  whatever it is. It's like your alarm on your phone when it goes off. It's like, oh yeah,
[823.03s -> 831.42s]  I sleep through my alarms. You just don't care about anything but sleeping. Hearing four hours
[831.42s -> 835.90s]  of prime numbers was not enough for me to just, just to roll over and pick up the changer or the
[835.90s -> 848.81s]  phone and turn off the TV. That was too much work. But I just suffered, and I would say suffered
[848.81s -> 854.86s]  wrong, but it was so bizarre. My brain was trying to piece it together. It was like, why is Babish
[854.86s -> 866.78s]  doing this? Like what, what is this? I thought I was dreaming. Oh, Otto. He, I can't, he's over
[866.78s -> 875.32s]  there. Oh, this is going to be a good one right here. I love this. Oh, I hope there's wicked,
[875.32s -> 883.58s]  dirty houses too. I get to switch nozzles and stuff. I got to do the first coat first though.
[884.06s -> 894.97s]  You're jerking off to power washing porn. No, I love these videos. They really are. If you really
[894.97s -> 902.81s]  have trouble sleeping, like that's very loud. I got to turn that down. Um, you know, oh, I have
[902.81s -> 908.87s]  like the beach sound effects. I have the, oh, it just plays the ocean. It just plays the outside.
[908.87s -> 916.26s]  No, no, no. I want log cutting videos because every, every like hour at one of them, one eye
[916.26s -> 923.30s]  will open and I'll just open one eye and just see like, oh yeah. Then I'll go back to bed.
[923.94s -> 932.54s]  All right. These windows are dirty. What's going on? I love this game by the way. This is so much
[932.54s -> 942.76s]  fun. So the body is still dirty. I got to switch nozzles. What does this one mean? That's force.
[946.25s -> 950.17s]  This is so much better than I thought it was going to be. This is such a fun game
[950.81s -> 970.97s]  because that's more pressure. Okay. There's even more grime on this thing. Hold on.
[970.97s -> 980.09s]  Just go outside. What do you mean just go outside? This is, you're using that wrong.
[980.73s -> 988.98s]  That term you're using that wrong. I don't have a car to power wash. This is not like I'm not
[988.98s -> 998.36s]  playing like soccer or football or anything. Dude, just go outside. This is an elaborate
[998.36s -> 1004.66s]  power washing device. I don't have one of these. I'm making, I'm getting it a hundred percent.
[1005.22s -> 1009.46s]  There's a removals van outside my nightmare neighbor's place. They're finally going. Whoever
[1009.46s -> 1016.39s]  moves in there is going to need a quality pressure washer. I'm your guy. That's my
[1016.39s -> 1025.24s]  favorite part right there. None I got to do with. That's my favorite part of any car wash
[1025.24s -> 1029.13s]  because the water just like spins all in there and gets all in there,
[1029.13s -> 1039.29s]  flies around out in your face and stuff. I love it. You're a raid. Who raided?
[1039.29s -> 1054.33s]  Oh, RT game prop. What's going on RT? Thanks for the raid. What's going on RT gamers playing
[1054.33s -> 1061.75s]  power washer simulator. RT is a swell, swell lad. If you do not follow RT, what's wrong with you?
[1066.49s -> 1075.53s]  Oh, thanks a lot, dude. Welcome everybody. Raid song. I don't do raid songs anymore.
[1077.38s -> 1080.50s]  At this point, the raid song is becoming like a fucking reunion show.
[1080.50s -> 1086.26s]  You understand? Like how many times you want me to do the raid song before we go through like 10
[1086.26s -> 1090.82s]  seasons of raid songs and now it's just so I don't even want to hear the raid song anymore.
[1090.82s -> 1110.89s]  Press R to rotate. Oh my God. Thank you for saving this whole stream. I love it. Let's rotate.
[1111.78s -> 1119.56s]  Thinner. This is just one of my, I'm living one of my favorite videos.
[1121.21s -> 1127.67s]  I can just see like the dirt kicking out underneath that flap. I love it. This is so good.
[1128.46s -> 1134.02s]  This might be boring to watch. Oh, whatever. This is the rest of my life is right now.
[1138.30s -> 1147.62s]  Flip it. There we go. You can crouch too. There's a crouch. Oh my God. I love it. I, okay. I gotta
[1147.62s -> 1154.55s]  stop being like the person at the restaurant that tries everybody's plate and goes, oh my God. I
[1154.55s -> 1163.14s]  love it. Oh my God. So good. Wow. What did you get? I just keep saying that. Look at how much
[1163.14s -> 1178.28s]  distilled extra dirt. And the worst part is when you get somebody that does that and you can tell
[1178.28s -> 1184.90s]  that they like your food way more than their food. So they start like, yeah, yeah, but try mine,
[1184.90s -> 1188.82s]  try mine. I'm going to give you a bunch of my spaghetti. Like, oh, I don't want all your
[1188.82s -> 1195.86s]  spaghetti. Try my spaghetti. And then you realize that they gave you a huge portion of their food.
[1196.42s -> 1200.58s]  So now you are obligated to be like, oh, well, you know, here I get half, you might, you gave
[1200.58s -> 1205.06s]  me a lot of your caps of mine. Oh yeah. Sure. I'll try it. And they scoop off like half of your
[1205.06s -> 1213.46s]  fucking plate. Like you didn't get the fucking, you didn't like, sorry, you got the filet mignon.
[1213.46s -> 1226.95s]  I got them. Come on. What restaurant are we in by the way? I hate that I ordered. That's not
[1226.95s -> 1239.13s]  relatable anymore. That's no longer relatable. What? Cause I said filet mignon. No, let's change it
[1239.13s -> 1250.04s]  to McDonald's. I love that place. And that happens to me all the time. Billionaire Billy. No, that's
[1250.04s -> 1258.57s]  not what I mean. I was just saying a random food. Ever seen water pressure videos? I missed what
[1258.57s -> 1264.71s]  you said, but yeah, I love water videos. I got to get the roof. Wait, this is still dirty.
[1264.71s -> 1275.14s]  How is this still dirty? Oh shit. I bet you eat caviar. I think caviar is fucking disgusting.
[1278.66s -> 1288.89s]  I'm sorry. I don't, I think that's gross. I'll tell you why I think caviar is disgusting. It has
[1288.89s -> 1293.38s]  nothing to do with how the thing tastes. The reason why I think caviar is disgusting is the
[1293.38s -> 1299.34s]  same reason why I wouldn't open up 12 eggs and scoop them out into a fucking cup and drink them
[1299.34s -> 1303.96s]  like a bodybuilder. Now I don't want to, I don't want to eat raw eggs. I don't want to just like
[1303.96s -> 1330.28s]  drink eggs. Why am I getting question marks? Do you guys know what caviar is? Drink the eggs.
[1334.28s -> 1345.82s]  Have you actually tried caviar? Who? Who? Who's that? Are you who-ing caviar? Why are you who-ing
[1345.82s -> 1353.43s]  caviar? It's not like a streamer. All right, change that nozzle. High pressure. Let's go.
[1354.07s -> 1368.68s]  You got to get the corners of the windows and then the middle. Dermot, stop. You're not using
[1368.68s -> 1378.74s]  any soap. What? I don't, you don't, what do you mean soap? I don't need soap. It's a power washer.
[1379.30s -> 1393.46s]  It's just the pressure of the nozzle takes out all the dirt, all the grime, all the filth,
[1394.36s -> 1400.89s]  and you don't need soap. Isn't that what they say in the commercials? All done with the power of
[1400.89s -> 1421.19s]  steam and liquid. Yeah, you don't need soap. Stop. What? Get down here. I mean, that was a really
[1421.19s -> 1426.95s]  just half-assed impression, but I'm busy enjoying this. You're going to need to, you're going to need
[1426.95s -> 1430.55s]  to go with that business name. What do you need me to think something up? I'm phenomenal. I thought
[1430.55s -> 1448.73s]  of routing Thomas for that Tyler and she's never looked back. What? No, they really are hitting a
[1448.73s -> 1458.33s]  completely untapped market here. You're ignoring the story. All right, so what do I, I see a red
[1458.33s -> 1471.54s]  canister. Oh, I would never shoot a pressure washer at like a propane tank. None of this stuff can
[1471.54s -> 1486.74s]  even move, so don't worry. I clean the ground too. All right, what do I need? The body is still,
[1486.74s -> 1492.06s]  ah, okay, cool. That's cool. Cool. All right, the mirrors. Don't forget about your mirrors.
[1492.70s -> 1506.54s]  Turn it off. How is the body still this dirty? This is going to be such a huge moment for me.
[1506.54s -> 1522.78s]  I love it. Here we go. Stop saying I love it. Stop taking people's spaghetti. It wasn't a perfect
[1522.78s -> 1535.37s]  line, but it was good enough. Let's go wider. Just like the video. Yeah, you got to do it just like
[1535.37s -> 1546.79s]  the video. It's got to be like swoops. They do these huge sweeps. Yep, you got it. You're right.
[1546.79s -> 1566.09s]  Exactly right. Use the jet pack. All right, I got it, got it, got it, got it, got it. How much more
[1566.09s -> 1579.26s]  is there left to do? This car is clean. There we go. All right, body is cleaned. Oh, back here.
[1585.14s -> 1591.85s]  Door is clean. Everything is clean here. Window, door, glass. What's that? What else? Oh, right here.
[1591.85s -> 1609.13s]  This is gross. This will be it for this one. What's dirty on the window? Where is it? Got it, okay.
[1609.93s -> 1635.32s]  99% cleaned. Tire? What else? Grill? No, that's clean, man. It is the grill, but where? Up underneath
[1635.32s -> 1653.00s]  the lights? What? 99%. All right, where's the rest of it? Mirrors? Other mirror? Press tab. Oh,
[1653.00s -> 1667.00s]  shit. I feel like that's kind of cheating, don't you think? Come on. Where is this? It's just
[1667.00s -> 1674.44s]  cheating vision. It is. I haven't pressed the tab. I don't see anything. Oh, it's the tire.
[1685.00s -> 1698.95s]  Oh, my God. How am I ever supposed to get all that? Another tire? Yep, I did it. Job complete.
[1698.95s -> 1710.57s]  Open the tablet. Wait, is that showing everything I did? That's awesome. It shows the video of what
[1710.57s -> 1721.64s]  you did. That's the greatest thing I've ever seen. How efficient was that? I would do the top first,
[1721.64s -> 1735.61s]  probably. Okay, cool. So now I got 150 bucks. Continue. Clean the back garden. It's 400 bucks.
[1735.69s -> 1742.07s]  What about the store? Power washers. A range of washers from small home units to industrial ones.
[1742.07s -> 1749.54s]  Cleaning liquids. Glass cleaner. Metal cleaner. Plastic cleaner. Universal cleaner.
[1749.54s -> 1757.78s]  But just get the universal one. Just put it on everything. From all surface materials.
[1757.78s -> 1766.07s]  Yeah, why would I get the... What do you mean no? Buy all the cleaners. It's more expensive. Yeah,
[1766.07s -> 1786.31s]  buy five bucks. Buy the stone. Buy the stone. Stone cleaner. I thought this said grass. Okay.
[1786.31s -> 1795.45s]  Equipment. Prime Vista 1500 turbo nozzle. Oh, shit. That sounds pretty good. It improves the
[1795.45s -> 1805.75s]  range while still being able to be used quite close to surfaces. Soap nozzle. I want... Okay,
[1805.75s -> 1811.50s]  I need the turbo nozzle. And I need this short extension. I want to save my money. Hold on. I
[1811.50s -> 1817.98s]  don't want to just buy a bunch of shit. Power washers. This is one I have right now. Surface,
[1817.98s -> 1823.91s]  encrusted, embedded. This is awesome. This is awesome. Everybody at the dinner table,
[1823.91s -> 1829.59s]  give me all of your plates. I'm eating all of your food. All of it. You know what? I'm eating
[1829.59s -> 1836.22s]  everything. I want to try all your food till there's nothing left on the plate,
[1836.22s -> 1847.83s]  and I'll give each of you 50 bucks. That fair? Medium. Heavy duty. Professional duty. How much
[1847.83s -> 1864.47s]  are these? 2,000. All right, we're good. Let's go. Why don't just order food? Okay, I think I know
[1864.47s -> 1868.70s]  what you mean. Like, why would I just give everybody $50? Why wouldn't I just order
[1868.70s -> 1875.91s]  everybody's entrees? Because the entrees were like 30 bucks. 20 bucks. Why wouldn't I just order
[1875.91s -> 1881.02s]  three or four of the things that they had? I see what you mean. Yeah, okay. All right, let's keep
[1881.02s -> 1893.50s]  going. Career. Garden time. Let's do it. This one's gonna be fun. I'm gonna clean the grass,
[1893.50s -> 1903.37s]  too. Don't tell them we're gonna get 50 bucks. Uh, doc, I'll help you like a challenge because
[1903.37s -> 1910.31s]  I'm pretty sure I've got the dirtiest backyard you've ever seen. That's not me bragging, by the way.
[1910.31s -> 1914.55s]  I had nothing to do with it. I just moved back to town for a bit to help my folks. We're both down
[1914.55s -> 1919.42s]  to their last knee and rented what I thought was a great little place. Anyway, my girls are itching
[1919.42s -> 1922.70s]  to get out there. I don't want them still itching when they get back. All right, I'll clean the
[1922.70s -> 1935.45s]  grass. Do I have the new nozzle? Oh, this back here is not, this is nothing. This is, this would
[1935.45s -> 1949.58s]  take 10 minutes. I need, how do I, do I, how do I equip the nozzle? Is it already on? Oh, here we go.
[1950.22s -> 1961.98s]  All right, prime vista turbo nozzle. That's what's on. Why is it doing that? This, it just makes figure
[1961.98s -> 1975.48s]  eights? Well, shit, how am I supposed to put on the extension nozzle? This is all over the place.
[1975.48s -> 1989.45s]  All right, well, let's go for it. No, I hate that. Take it off now. Get it off. What the fuck happened
[1989.45s -> 1999.94s]  in here? Don't stop saying Aaron. All right, we're going to start with the, uh, we start with the
[1999.94s -> 2013.69s]  walls, the fence, even more pressure. This is wood. How do I put the soap on? Here we go. Universal
[2013.69s -> 2035.05s]  cleaner equipped. Is it on? I think it's on, right? Is it something neighbor to come on and be like,
[2035.05s -> 2038.89s]  what the hell? Why is there a bunch of drawings? I'm just going to draw like fuck you on the side
[2038.89s -> 2052.97s]  of their house. You need a soap nozzle at the tops. Don't hold on. You didn't buy the soap nozzle.
[2052.97s -> 2072.60s]  Oh, well, whatever. Oh, this is stuff. I can't, I have to say it, but I, uh, I don't want it.
[2072.60s -> 2083.00s]  Okay. I'm not going to say it. Are you guys going to be ordering dessert? No, no, I'm stuffed.
[2083.72s -> 2092.47s]  How come we just can't say no? Just say, no, I don't want dessert. No, fuck, just go waiter. I
[2092.47s -> 2098.07s]  flew all I would. I just like so much food. Look at all this stuff. Just say I don't fucking want
[2098.07s -> 2109.27s]  dessert. Why does it make us look bad? I always make up like an elaborate story as to why I
[2109.27s -> 2118.06s]  don't want to order dessert. I don't want the waiter to think I'm like a weirdo or something.
[2118.06s -> 2127.26s]  Quit saying we, when it's only you. No, I know a lot of people do this shit, not just me.
[2127.98s -> 2147.35s]  What was that? You're crazy. I'm, I don't know. I always have this thing in my brain
[2147.99s -> 2151.35s]  where if you, if a good waiter or waitress comes over and they're like, oh,
[2151.35s -> 2156.07s]  would you like to see our dessert menu? And it's like, no, just like, oh, well, you don't even want
[2156.07s -> 2163.19s]  to look at it. Why? I, I don't want it. I know that's never going to happen, but it's this weird
[2163.19s -> 2168.55s]  thing in my brain that is going to happen. So instead of having to say no and be like, well,
[2168.55s -> 2172.71s]  you don't want to even look at it. I just go, I make up like an elaborate tale of why I can't
[2172.71s -> 2178.79s]  eat dessert today. Just say no, thank you. I know that's simple, but I, I had, there has to be like
[2178.79s -> 2186.18s]  a reason why I can't eat it. Like I lean back and I put my hands on my belly and I like rub it and
[2186.18s -> 2213.94s]  I go, oh, I would, but whoa, that's, that's weirder. Did you get to the horror part yet?
[2213.94s -> 2218.18s]  Oh, ban that guy. Is that real? I'm just kidding. Don't ban him. I know it's not real.
[2221.69s -> 2230.17s]  If you say, whoa, at a waiter, you should tip them $50. Uh, my base line of tipping
[2230.73s -> 2253.67s]  is at least 20%. That's the base. It only goes up from there. 21%. No, I hate, okay. What I'm
[2253.67s -> 2258.39s]  saying right now is the equivalent of, so if we go to a restaurant or something, if you go somewhere,
[2258.39s -> 2264.22s]  you sit down with some friends and that's like actually telling the waiter, oh, by the way,
[2264.22s -> 2269.26s]  I just want to let you know I'm a good tipper. Isn't that always seen to be the case that that
[2269.26s -> 2287.93s]  person tips like 12% or like 8% or something. That's a lot of community subs. Uh, void 880.
[2287.93s -> 2303.32s]  Thanks for the, hold on a minute. Hey void. Hold on. Hey void. Hey void 880. Thanks for the
[2303.32s -> 2322.87s]  community subs. I was spelling the name. It's hard. I can't, it's hard to spell with a power
[2322.87s -> 2331.66s]  washer. But no, I, I know that saying that I tip well means I don't tip well. I just think I do
[2331.66s -> 2339.24s]  for some reason. It's like, well, hell, yo, you think, you think like 7% is a good tip?
[2340.12s -> 2344.28s]  Of course I think it's a good tip. What do you mean? It's a, it's a tip. It's a very generous tip.
[2345.88s -> 2359.98s]  They forgot to fill my water, by the way. They didn't fill my water up twice. I mean,
[2360.62s -> 2366.63s]  you see how many people are in this place right now? I thought the waiter was, was pretty good.
[2370.12s -> 2378.04s]  No, and you know, I heard a sneeze. I heard a sneeze. So I, I don't, I don't, I'm not,
[2378.04s -> 2392.84s]  I don't like this place. Okay. Nice run. This one needs the more powerful one. Definitely. Oh yeah.
[2393.40s -> 2411.43s]  This one needs the, yeah. That's how you get in there. You're fucking up the flower beds?
[2412.07s -> 2426.33s]  Oh, I guess I kind of am, aren't I? You gotta stand back. Yeah, that's better. My dentist uses
[2426.33s -> 2441.34s]  this one. I actually love this thing at the dentist. I know we have talked about this,
[2441.34s -> 2443.82s]  but there's a lot of new people on this channel and we have to go over this again.
[2445.91s -> 2451.51s]  Everybody here hates getting their teeth scaled, right? They fucking hate it. Everybody here.
[2451.51s -> 2460.95s]  Is that, am I, right? No, no, no, I actually like, see, this is what I don't understand.
[2462.01s -> 2469.24s]  There are a bunch of people that like this, getting their teeth scaled. That, it sucks. It's
[2469.32s -> 2473.08s]  horrible. It's one of the worst things I've ever, it's one of the worst fucking things.
[2473.80s -> 2481.99s]  Scaling, if you don't know what scaling is, it's that little knife hook that they scrape
[2481.99s -> 2497.37s]  your teeth gum line with. It's the worst thing on earth. Yeah. I, I hate it. Who wants that?
[2498.01s -> 2502.58s]  There's a bunch of people that like it. It's at least like 20, 30% of people that actually like
[2502.58s -> 2506.58s]  it. I know a handful of people that I've come across, friends, family. I know people that like
[2506.58s -> 2514.84s]  it. They're like, oh yeah, it feels good. Well, the reason why I bring it up is because they have
[2514.84s -> 2520.38s]  one, it's like a water scaler. It goes like this and they do that like all over your gums and stuff.
[2520.38s -> 2538.62s]  And I much prefer it over the scraping. All right. I don't go to the dentist. Well, then you missed
[2538.62s -> 2549.94s]  out on the goodie bag. Don't tell them, don't tell them about the goodie bag. If you've been
[2549.94s -> 2561.22s]  to the dentist before, you missed out. If people that have no idea what I'm talking about, they're
[2561.22s -> 2565.30s]  like, what do you mean the goodie bag? Oh, it's one of these people talking about
[2566.42s -> 2586.07s]  no goodie bag. Okay. I still get the goodie bag. All right. Tell me if I'm crazy because I need to
[2586.07s -> 2592.65s]  know. Did you guys, when you were a kid, go to the dentist and after you were done, you got to go
[2592.65s -> 2599.67s]  to like the toy center and they had these little like small cheap toys. It was like a big treasure
[2599.67s -> 2610.10s]  chest that you can go like get toys from. That was awesome. That was the best part. When I still go
[2610.10s -> 2618.31s]  to the dentist, when they're done, I go, oh, there's cotton in my mouth. Can I get a toy? Can
[2618.31s -> 2628.86s]  I go to the toy box? And it's not even weird. They don't even care. Okay. Don't do that. I'm sorry.
[2628.86s -> 2638.38s]  I'm trying to, here's the thing about those toys that you got from the dentist. I have this like
[2638.38s -> 2646.95s]  memory. I can't remember any of them. They were all so strange. It was like a device where you
[2646.95s -> 2651.35s]  pressed a button and it made little water come up like colored blue colored water or something.
[2651.35s -> 2660.38s]  Like I, they don't even real toys. Well, one of them had like a, I'm making this up, but a string
[2661.02s -> 2665.27s]  attached to like a little bicycle thing and you turn the wheel and the string would fly around.
[2665.27s -> 2671.99s]  I don't remember any of them. They were only in the dentist's office. I've never seen them ever
[2671.99s -> 2687.27s]  again. Sticky hand. Oh yeah. They did have sticky hands. You're right. Bouncy balls. I don't remember
[2687.27s -> 2691.75s]  bouncy balls. I remember the weird like the rings. Yeah. It was the thing with the, I remember that
[2691.75s -> 2699.35s]  in the water. All right. This is still dirty, but I'm going to come back to it.
[2699.35s -> 2707.86s]  It's still a shitload of dirt on here. Where is it though? Oh, I've done that before. I've done that
[2707.86s -> 2713.93s]  before. How many of you guys have done yard work or helped it around the house? I've done that a
[2713.93s -> 2722.60s]  bunch of times or you don't, you just don't do the insides. You just do this and you don't do the
[2722.60s -> 2739.78s]  insides or the back. You just want to be done. Okay. I'll do the other side after. All right.
[2739.78s -> 2747.42s]  Should I do the patio furniture first? You should do that while painting. Well, I mean with paint,
[2747.42s -> 2756.71s]  you have to paint the fence. You can't just, what? So the only, yeah, it's when we, I don't know what
[2756.71s -> 2763.00s]  something, when I was like a teenager for some reason, but just being able to view it from this
[2763.00s -> 2768.20s]  angle and it looking clean was enough for me to think that my parents weren't going to care.
[2768.20s -> 2774.58s]  Just this picture, this snapshot was like, I did it. It's done. Oh yeah, it is done. And then like,
[2774.58s -> 2779.48s]  that's all it took for them to look. That only worked for about two minutes before they came
[2779.48s -> 2785.77s]  outside. And the weird teenager brain was like, yeah, that's enough to like fool them for me to
[2785.77s -> 2794.26s]  be able to ride my bike down the street now. I already told you guys how I mowed the lawn.
[2794.26s -> 2801.93s]  Everybody thought I was crazy. How I used to mow the lawn was I thought it was a genius idea
[2801.93s -> 2808.86s]  was I just did a giant circle and just every time I kept going, I went a little bit more
[2808.86s -> 2814.62s]  further on the line and I just kept going in a circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle,
[2814.70s -> 2823.35s]  circle, circle, circle, until it was down in the middle. That's how you do it. I did that too.
[2823.35s -> 2831.11s]  Yeah. But the correct way is you go is like, you're not supposed to be like, just do a big spiral,
[2831.11s -> 2849.05s]  right? That's a great way to do it. All right. If you hired somebody to do this and you looked
[2849.05s -> 2859.51s]  outside and they were going like this, but they still did the job well, what's the scenario?
[2859.51s -> 2867.66s]  Like, let's say they did that. Is the scenario you don't call them back? You just go, thanks,
[2867.66s -> 2870.30s]  appreciate it. Thanks for the power wash. And you just don't call them back to do it again.
[2871.93s -> 2886.18s]  Or do you say, Hey, stop doing that. Clean the car. I hold on. I'm getting clean,
[2886.18s -> 2906.22s]  overwhelming here. Oh, there's so much dirty shit. Is this doing it? Yep. It's like rust.
[2906.22s -> 2919.30s]  Can I get it with this? Are we going to go harder? That feels so awesome. What a simple concept.
[2925.26s -> 2933.10s]  It's perfect. All right. How many of you guys used to stand out here like this
[2933.10s -> 2944.17s]  and pretend you had a flame thrower sprayed up and down? I remember, I remember like,
[2945.61s -> 2949.93s]  if you stood like far enough away. So let's say for instance, if like, if somebody was like there,
[2950.65s -> 2955.99s]  like where the, uh, the bird houses, I remember my brother used to stand really far back and just
[2955.99s -> 2962.31s]  go like this and it would, I, there would just be this mist that would overtake the whole area.
[2962.31s -> 2972.10s]  I ever tell you guys about how I used to put on hockey equipment and my brother used to like
[2972.10s -> 2987.85s]  throw baseballs at me. I did, right? Let me give context. Let me give context. Context, context
[2987.85s -> 2994.60s]  matters. Listen, listen, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The context matters. Just wait. So I have an
[2994.60s -> 3001.67s]  older brother and he was a pitcher. So he was like, when he was younger, he was like, you know, in
[3001.67s -> 3005.83s]  middle school and high school, he was a pitcher. He played on baseball teams and stuff. And I played
[3005.83s -> 3011.51s]  baseball too, but I wasn't nearly as good, right? So he always wanted to practice pitching, but
[3012.23s -> 3015.51s]  at the house, it was just like, Oh, who do you practice with? Uh, I got, do you want to like
[3015.51s -> 3022.58s]  practice? I want to like try some new pitches. And I was not very good. And I was like, I was,
[3022.58s -> 3028.38s]  I was so scared of, of getting like drill with the baseball. So we put me in a bunch of hockey
[3028.38s -> 3032.78s]  equipment, like a hockey mask, hockey pads. I looked ridiculous. I had that bunch of like a
[3032.78s -> 3039.19s]  football pads on helmet, everything. And I would just sit out there with a glove and he would just
[3039.19s -> 3045.18s]  like, just gun them at me, like just whip them at me. And like, it would be like chest sometimes
[3045.18s -> 3049.48s]  because I couldn't catch very well, but I wanted to like help. I wanted to like, let him practice
[3053.45s -> 3057.61s]  half the time. The ball would just hit me like somewhere in the chest or like the knees or like
[3057.61s -> 3062.82s]  the face, but I had a ton of, I was covered. I think I even had pillows all over me too.
[3065.29s -> 3069.05s]  Yeah. I w we would, we like taped pillows to my arms and stuff. So like, it didn't matter.
[3069.61s -> 3080.38s]  And on the one or two times that I caught it, it just, it would hurt. It hurt. And I kind of
[3080.38s -> 3084.39s]  didn't want to catch it because it'd be like, he'd be like, all right, okay, here comes another one.
[3084.39s -> 3091.51s]  I'm going to, I'm going to try fastball and to be like, Oh, that sucks. This sucks.
[3092.47s -> 3096.47s]  So eventually I just like started pretending like I was terrible and just let them hit me in the
[3096.47s -> 3105.05s]  chest and like the face and stuff because it didn't hurt. You're explaining the story from
[3105.05s -> 3117.85s]  the mighty ducks. This happened though. I, this actually happened. And it got to a point where
[3117.85s -> 3121.53s]  he would, he, he would be like, you know, it'd be like after school or something. He'd be like,
[3121.53s -> 3125.61s]  Hey, Hey, Jeremy, you want to put the hockey pads on? And I'm like, yeah, I want to put the
[3125.61s -> 3134.60s]  hockey pads on. And that translated to a bunch of different activities that I could just, I was
[3134.60s -> 3148.47s]  going to never get hurt. I would never get hurt. It was like a little brother suit of armor that
[3148.47s -> 3162.55s]  I would put on. This is clean, right? This one little piece that's not, where is it? Would he
[3162.55s -> 3175.19s]  beat you up in the gear too? I mean, like maybe sometimes it would just like, like scoop slam me
[3175.19s -> 3184.57s]  or something. But it was, it was, we were like doing something. It was like, Oh, we're going to
[3184.57s -> 3195.98s]  play like fighters or something. Oh, I'm going to get the hockey pads. Like we're going to do any
[3195.98s -> 3201.05s]  outdoor activity. And it required us to like do anything really active. I would probably just
[3201.05s -> 3207.18s]  put the hockey pads on because I just, what do you mean sometimes beating you up? No, no. This was
[3207.18s -> 3214.26s]  like, we were having like fun as brothers. And it was like, you know what? I'm just going to,
[3214.26s -> 3234.87s]  I'll put, I'll put the pillows on my arms just in case I don't get hurt. Repressed memory. I
[3234.87s -> 3239.75s]  just told you that it was like, it was fun to put the hockey pads on and like play baseball and
[3239.75s -> 3250.76s]  like run outside and do weird shit and like play fighters and stuff. As they made a product called
[3250.76s -> 3255.24s]  sock and boppers. Okay. Oh, what, what are you talking about? You, your brother used to like,
[3255.24s -> 3259.32s]  you used to put pillows on and your brother, you would like throw, you hold on and wait, wait.
[3259.32s -> 3264.84s]  There was a fucking product where you put these air gloves on and beat the shit out of each other.
[3266.42s -> 3280.30s]  This was not abnormal. Sock and boppers, sock and boppers. It's more fun than a pillow fight.
[3282.47s -> 3302.23s]  You put on these kids boxing gloves and just beat each other up. Memory unlocked. I,
[3302.23s -> 3306.23s]  and now that I think about it, it's like, so there was a company that they really wanted to, oh,
[3306.23s -> 3310.79s]  like a pillow fight. Like people, like, uh, like brothers and sisters or party or something. You're
[3310.79s -> 3315.35s]  like just hitting each other with pillows. You know, you've got to be careful. Let's make kids
[3315.35s -> 3332.66s]  boxing gloves. It's like, wait, what? I did. I missed a spot. I just got it. All right. There
[3332.66s -> 3349.64s]  it is. Don't crouch. It's bad for your back. It was no ad. Your brother made a fake ad so he could
[3349.64s -> 3356.73s]  beat you up with those. Well, when my brother was fucking like 12 or 13 or something, he sure was
[3356.73s -> 3363.51s]  like a really great like engineer of plastic material. I don't know where he did that. And
[3363.51s -> 3376.66s]  well, that's very interesting. He had his own like factory, I guess. Oh, that's really dirty. Get
[3376.66s -> 3395.82s]  rid of that. Still on there somewhere. Where, where is it? Oh, that's very interesting. Oh,
[3395.82s -> 3410.58s]  that's right. Dirt vision, right? Sorry. I said, take a quick shower. Stop juggling.
[3411.38s -> 3435.78s]  What's the age difference between you and your brother? Uh, 30 years. It's one star. I'm not,
[3435.78s -> 3439.54s]  I'm not going to just leave the job. I'm in the middle of doing this. It takes a while.
[3440.26s -> 3457.24s]  Oh, somebody in a pre-stream was just, I caught it. I caught it. I, look, I saw it. They said,
[3457.24s -> 3465.34s]  what the fuck is that from? Please tell me. I need to know. And like, I, I could tell you
[3465.34s -> 3471.85s]  an old sound effect. They used to put in lots of stuff back in like the early 90s, mid 2000s,
[3471.85s -> 3478.41s]  early 2000s. The one where it's the most prevalent is the first boss of the Simpsons arcade game.
[3478.41s -> 3485.45s]  He goes, and it's been stuck in my head for years and I can never get rid of it. And I just do it
[3485.45s -> 3496.66s]  sometimes, but it was, it was used a lot. I love cleaning rocks. I just got here. Has it been funny
[3496.66s -> 3500.34s]  yet? Oh my God. You have no idea. You missed so many funny stories. You missed so many funny
[3500.34s -> 3503.54s]  things. You missed like, I couldn't put the nozzle on right for like 20 minutes. Everyone was like,
[3503.54s -> 3520.22s]  pretending Pog. He's pretending Andy. It was awesome. This one's done. I don't even know.
[3520.22s -> 3533.32s]  Sometimes you clean it twice. This is good. Where is it? It's somewhere in here.
[3534.86s -> 3545.93s]  Fence post. Come on, get it. Fence panel, fence post. This is all good. All right.
[3545.93s -> 3566.52s]  I don't see anything. Here we go. I don't need that nozzle. Let's, yeah, there we go.
[3566.52s -> 3572.62s]  Wouldn't this fuck up the lawnmower? I have to imagine that spraying water inside of an engine
[3572.62s -> 3583.08s]  is probably not a good idea. Very dirty though. Oh, if you want to know what we're doing next week,
[3583.72s -> 3587.80s]  there's a couple of things that are going on next week. I'll tell you. So first of all,
[3588.68s -> 3596.92s]  um, E3 is this coming weekend. So that's perfect timing. Perfect timing. I'm going to stream on
[3596.92s -> 3601.18s]  Saturday and do the Microsoft conference. And then whatever's after that, I'm not going to do,
[3601.82s -> 3607.58s]  I don't really care about the Ubisoft conference. It really don't. I don't think it's, I really
[3607.58s -> 3616.70s]  don't think it's worth me streaming that conference, but we'll do Microsoft and we'll do Square Enix.
[3619.18s -> 3625.72s]  And then, uh, that same stream, I don't even, I'm, I might even just say like, oh, thanks.
[3629.08s -> 3633.08s]  It's my 10 year anniversary being on like line on YouTube and Twitch.
[3633.64s -> 3640.55s]  That's happening. I think on that, that's like Thursday of this week coming up. It's the actual
[3640.55s -> 3649.21s]  10 year anniversary. So I don't, I don't really have anything planned or anything.
[3649.21s -> 3654.98s]  I was kind of just going to bring it up. So I guess I just already did.
[3655.54s -> 3667.40s]  That's the best bird shit nozzle. Probably this one. You're so old. I know I am so old
[3668.04s -> 3682.95s]  and I'm just getting older. I can go wider. Can I, I need to buy that soap nozzle. Let's
[3682.95s -> 3693.03s]  probably go so much quicker. Yeah. If I don't address it for some reason on next weekend's
[3693.03s -> 3705.91s]  stream, then yeah, I, I started doing YouTube when I was like 25 and here I am at 35. Yes,
[3705.91s -> 3712.44s]  that's how old I am. People think I'm like, I don't know why people think I'm like 23 or something.
[3712.44s -> 3721.48s]  I might act like a fucking 25 year old, but I'm 35 and I pay taxes. No, they don't.
[3728.70s -> 3732.86s]  But yeah, I don't know. I, I have no idea what my future looks like. I don't know.
[3736.02s -> 3740.42s]  10 years ago, if you told me that I was going to be continuing to do this 10 years later,
[3740.42s -> 3748.73s]  I would have been like, I don't think so. I have no idea. So it's surprising that this many people
[3748.73s -> 3767.38s]  are even here anyways. So this is still dirty. Oh, it's this. All right, let's get it a little
[3767.38s -> 3783.29s]  deeper. Come on. Yeah. You, I've been watching you for 10 years. Ew. What do you mean? Ew.
[3783.93s -> 3795.46s]  I say, ew. How am I going to get on the roof? Is there a ladder? How do I get clean that?
[3796.73s -> 3812.31s]  I just have to jump. Holy shit. Okay. I guess I could, I'm going to take advantage of this.
[3826.68s -> 3843.05s]  I am, you need the propeller. I would just open up the back slider at this point, like the back
[3843.05s -> 3847.53s]  door or whatever, and just be like, ah, there's a ladder in the garage, dude. Do you need it?
[3852.36s -> 3862.50s]  You don't have to do that. I need, uh, this is very dirty. Look at how dirty this is.
[3862.50s -> 3895.66s]  Don't fall off. I'm almost there. How's it look? Okay. We've been watching you since 2013.
[3897.56s -> 3903.58s]  Yeah. And I'll make the same reference here. That's very surprising to me
[3903.58s -> 3908.54s]  because after seven years of a TV show, we keep using that magic number of seven,
[3908.54s -> 3915.45s]  after the seventh or eighth season of a TV show, usually people start to get a little tired of it.
[3915.45s -> 3931.72s]  So I, I'm surprised that 10 years later, the TV show still exists, but you're a person.
[3933.03s -> 3940.04s]  Yeah, but still, I mean, usually there's a pretty finite amount of time that is super quote,
[3940.04s -> 3948.57s]  quote, quote, media is seen as worth watching, right? Remember you're the Simpsons of the
[3948.57s -> 3955.16s]  internet. Don't say that. Don't say that. I think there's like, I think there's like 30 people that
[3955.16s -> 3967.61s]  still watch the Simpsons. I wouldn't say that. It could be a great show. I have no idea. There's a
[3967.61s -> 3971.77s]  really small amount of people that really enjoy that show still, and it might be the best television
[3971.77s -> 3976.54s]  out there. I have no idea. I haven't watched it in probably 10 years. I've not seen a single episode
[3976.54s -> 3990.23s]  of the Simpsons since probably like 2008. They definitely have your 18, 18.8 K Andy. Well,
[3990.23s -> 3995.91s]  I didn't say my, I did not say my show is better than the Simpsons. I didn't say I have more viewers
[3995.91s -> 4002.55s]  than the Simpsons. I said that maybe three people watch the Simpsons in every city, in every town,
[4002.55s -> 4008.17s]  in every state, in every country, in every province. I did not clarify what I meant by
[4008.17s -> 4035.19s]  that statement. So in actuality, it's probably like 800,000, 600,000 people. Where's this dirt?
[4035.19s -> 4048.82s]  Simpsons for every home. I'll tell this story because it's kind of interesting.
[4048.82s -> 4055.99s]  So I was at the, I was at the pet store. This is literally yesterday. I was at the pet store.
[4056.55s -> 4062.30s]  I needed to get something for auto and I did not know where the object was. I didn't know where the
[4062.30s -> 4069.32s]  item was. So I walked up to what I thought was one of the employees and I was like, excuse me,
[4069.96s -> 4075.24s]  we're going to get like the dog beds that have the things so my dog can walk up the stairs.
[4075.24s -> 4078.76s]  Because auto has like, you know, I don't want him to be jumping or anything. So I wanted to be able
[4078.76s -> 4082.26s]  to go on one of those ramps and sometimes they sell them at the pet stores. So I'm like, oh,
[4082.26s -> 4089.74s]  do you guys sell those? And the guy goes, I don't, I don't work here. I was like, what?
[4090.54s -> 4096.17s]  And then the person that they were with was like, are you Jerma? I was like, wait, what?
[4096.89s -> 4102.01s]  Wait, I, I thought you were an employee. And I actually went like, oh, uh, what's, what,
[4102.01s -> 4108.06s]  what do you, Jerma, who's that? And they were like, Jerma Twitch. I was like, what's Twitch?
[4111.43s -> 4118.87s]  And they were just like, I, it's this, you're not Jerma. And I was like, oh, look at me.
[4118.87s -> 4122.23s]  And I did the look at me thing. I don't know. I was like, oh, maybe I'll like be funny about it.
[4124.98s -> 4130.26s]  And they were like, you are fucking Jerma, you liar. And I was like, yeah, it's me.
[4130.74s -> 4136.47s]  So I, I just like, was like, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I thought you were like, I thought you've
[4136.47s -> 4140.87s]  worked here. Cause they had like a similar shirt on as like what the, what one of the employees
[4140.87s -> 4148.14s]  had on. And they were like, no. And I'm like, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Uh, this is real.
[4148.14s -> 4155.02s]  I swear to God. And no, they were really nice. They're really cool. It's that rarely ever happens
[4155.02s -> 4162.15s]  by the way. I wanted to talk about it though. The roof is done. All right. I got to get off the
[4162.23s -> 4170.26s]  roof. Stop doing the roof. But yeah, it was, uh, it was, it was really, they were really nice.
[4170.26s -> 4174.58s]  They're really sweet about it. I took a picture and I was like, oh, that was cool.
[4175.78s -> 4187.83s]  I just felt like an asshole. I felt like an idiot. It's a cringe streamer moment.
[4189.11s -> 4206.94s]  What's the weirdest place you've been recognized? Um, probably in one of the casinos here happened
[4206.94s -> 4216.60s]  to like a couple of years ago. It was just like, Hey, I know you. It was like, oh, all right.
[4216.60s -> 4223.11s]  That was it. That was literally it. They just like knew that it was me. No, like we didn't talk
[4223.11s -> 4228.63s]  about really anything. It was just kind of like, yeah, I know who you are. And then they just like,
[4228.63s -> 4232.31s]  they just went on with their rest of the, Oh no, no, somebody screamed at me. Somebody screamed at
[4232.31s -> 4238.68s]  me. Yeah. Somebody screamed at me from a car. Oh, I fucking forgot about this. I was at a mall
[4240.22s -> 4243.66s]  and somebody like was in the parking lot of the mall and they like drove by and they were like,
[4244.62s -> 4254.23s]  and I was like, what the fuck? Who's who is that? This is, this is like three or four years ago. I
[4254.23s -> 4265.54s]  think. Yeah. They screamed my name and they were in a car and it scared the shit out of me because
[4265.54s -> 4274.28s]  I was like, wait, who, huh? And I think I just waved. I was like, hi, that was it. That was it.
[4274.28s -> 4281.37s]  It was not like, Oh, hey, like, let's stop it. Like, Hey, are you? No, nope. They just screamed
[4281.37s -> 4297.48s]  my name. That was actually me. Oh, whoever you were. I mean, like you screamed at me. And that
[4297.48s -> 4319.19s]  was it. And I like, if anyone's like wondering, if you're like curious, I don't care. I don't care.
[4319.19s -> 4323.35s]  If, like, if you see me out in public or something, if you happen to think it's me or something,
[4323.35s -> 4327.19s]  you're like, Hey, I don't want to, like, I don't want to bother. He's probably so busy. Oh my God,
[4327.19s -> 4331.03s]  he's probably so he's probably, Oh, he's like the streamer. No, I'm probably literally like going
[4331.03s -> 4336.65s]  and buying like socks. Like I'm not doing anything important. If you would have like,
[4336.65s -> 4341.32s]  waved me down and be like, Hey, are you? I'd be like, yeah, I'll probably talk to you for a
[4341.32s -> 4346.66s]  little bit. Wouldn't be like it. That doesn't bother me though. So if you're, if you ever do
[4346.66s -> 4354.63s]  see, you ever see me out in public, you know, I don't care. As long as you're not like fucking
[4354.63s -> 4360.90s]  weird. Like if you're not weird about it, I don't care. Don't be weird about it. You know what I
[4360.90s -> 4384.28s]  mean? Yeah. Yeah. Let me be the weird one. Let me be the weird one. I like the, I like this,
[4384.28s -> 4393.98s]  this nozzle better. Oh, come on. Don't be weird. But I would use that as a blanket statement for
[4393.98s -> 4403.78s]  everything though. Just don't be weird. You know what I mean? I'm really happy to like
[4404.60s -> 4407.88s]  talk to people and hang out with people just for like a little while. But like,
[4407.88s -> 4411.56s]  I just don't be weird about it. Like I, I, I, I, I don't want to, I don't want to be weird to you.
[4411.56s -> 4417.58s]  Right. But I did say, I did do like look at me in the middle of a pet store, but like whatever,
[4417.58s -> 4427.62s]  like whatever, let me be the weird one. If other people there must've been like,
[4427.62s -> 4451.98s]  what the fuck is going on? Who is this guy? If I see you in real life, can I give you
[4451.98s -> 4470.95s]  bits or subs? No, I literally will not. I will not accept that. Real bits. No.
[4477.77s -> 4488.07s]  Where's the dirt? Edges? Yep. Uh-huh. What about a gift card? If you give me a gift card,
[4488.07s -> 4491.51s]  I'm going to do what everybody does with gift cards. And I'm going to put it into my wallet
[4491.51s -> 4498.36s]  and forget it's there for a year or two. And then by the time I want to use it, the store
[4498.36s -> 4503.50s]  that you gave me the gift card to, I probably not even, I probably don't even have one near me
[4503.50s -> 4514.01s]  anymore. I don't know. Like I may have like moved across like the state lines at that point. And
[4514.01s -> 4528.15s]  that store doesn't even, I don't have one of those near me. Okay. What's next? I got all that.
[4528.15s -> 4542.14s]  That's good. 32% clean. What else is left? Oh shit. All this stuff. What the fuck? I just
[4542.14s -> 4589.83s]  cleaned this. What? Go. Let's go thinner. Yeah. No. Yeah. Oh, sunflowers. I have those. Congrats.
[4591.88s -> 4597.80s]  Yeah. That was my, that was my way for you to be like sunflowers. What do you mean sunflowers?
[4597.80s -> 4603.00s]  Dermot sunflowers. And then I get to tell you about all my gardening. I'm annoying. I'm really
[4603.00s -> 4619.69s]  annoying. Look, I'll just tell you about it. And then you can just look at your phone and say every
[4619.69s -> 4638.52s]  last word of every sentence that I say. Okay. Would you, should you not do this to upholstery?
[4638.52s -> 4653.64s]  I feel like you don't do this to upholstery. So I have some flowers and I've got four in a big pot
[4655.86s -> 4665.26s]  and they are just barely going into adulthood. And I'm really into it. I think it's a really cool
[4665.26s -> 4676.82s]  thing. They're very big. They're going to be probably six feet tall. Yep. Yep. Yep. You're
[4676.82s -> 4680.50s]  paying attention. I know you are. Otherwise, how would you know the last word that I just said?
[4683.37s -> 4688.15s]  Uh, I don't know. I forget the exact name. I think they're, uh, I'm going to get, I don't
[4688.15s -> 4693.69s]  want to say the wrong name, but they're going to be really tall. I go out there every day.
[4700.28s -> 4703.16s]  You're like on your phone. Someone's telling you a story. You just type it away.
[4704.84s -> 4707.96s]  And so it was really cool when they came over and, uh, uh,
[4709.35s -> 4723.03s]  why is it? It's like, what the fuck, dude? Give me the big one. Oh, this is fucking filthy.
[4723.59s -> 4733.27s]  Do I have any other flowers? Oh, I have a, I have a money tree. That does not stay outside though.
[4734.54s -> 4746.52s]  Money tree is, uh, inside. Money tree. They're really cute. It's a, it's a little one. It's one
[4746.52s -> 4753.30s]  of those, uh, small, uh, braided ones. I have a few succulents that sit in a little container.
[4756.86s -> 4760.06s]  And then I have, I don't know what it's like a little, it's a little like polka dot plant.
[4760.06s -> 4763.18s]  I forget what it's called, but it's this little, it says like it's, it's small. It's maybe about
[4763.18s -> 4771.11s]  as big as a baseball. It has green, pink polka dot leaves. It's almost like the channel colors.
[4771.11s -> 4777.22s]  It's really cool. And I take good care of them and I love them very much.
[4786.54s -> 4814.14s]  Oh, gross. Did poison ivy? No, it's like a, it's like a little desert plant. Jesus. He's
[4814.14s -> 4822.55s]  still playing video games. What did you expect me not to be playing games anymore? I still play
[4822.55s -> 4838.36s]  games like occasionally, right? I play games like this because this is sick. Turns out they're
[4838.36s -> 4849.94s]  literally called what? I missed it. I need to get up there. Let's do the car. Play backgammon next.
[4850.58s -> 4860.22s]  I don't even, I don't know how to play backgammon. Backgammon was always a game that somebody had
[4860.22s -> 4882.23s]  in their house as a display. I never took it out of the box. Ooh, that looks nice actually. Play
[4882.23s -> 4894.65s]  blackjack in Fallout New Vegas. Yeah, that one. It's the car from the carnival. It kind of does
[4894.65s -> 4911.32s]  look like that. Uh, give me the red one. This one's better. Gambling stream when? Isn't gambling,
[4911.32s -> 4924.73s]  isn't like gambling on Twitch now? Yes, lots, lots. You know, I really didn't, I thought,
[4924.73s -> 4931.74s]  I never thought that slots were going to be a thing. I always knew that like, yeah, you could
[4931.74s -> 4935.26s]  do it, but I never thought it would be, honestly, I'll take, I'll take the loss on that one. I thought
[4935.26s -> 4943.22s]  it was going to be Battleship. Honestly, I thought it would, I would have been Twister before it would
[4943.22s -> 4964.14s]  have been slots. We just went right to slots, huh? Twister is, oh, by the way, I forgot to say this.
[4964.14s -> 4971.05s]  I watched the entire movie of Son of the Mask last night. I don't know why. Do you know why?
[4972.09s -> 4979.37s]  This is, this is weird to say. I don't, I, I, the movie sucks, okay? But listen, I wanted to watch
[4979.93s -> 4987.42s]  all like the really shitty scenes in a row, but I didn't want to open up like 10 YouTube tabs
[4987.42s -> 4999.27s]  to watch just the scenes of the movie that I wanted to watch. So I just rented it and I just
[4999.27s -> 5005.67s]  got, I just did the thing I was going to do anyways. The best part of that whole movie is
[5005.67s -> 5009.03s]  the part where he goes, you're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You're
[5009.03s -> 5012.63s]  just too good to be true. You're just too good. Oh, it's, it's so bad. I hate it, but I watch it all
[5012.63s -> 5017.40s]  the time. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You're too good to be
[5017.40s -> 5038.14s]  true. I know I love you so much. Yes, I watched Son of the Mask before Megamind. By the way,
[5038.14s -> 5042.78s]  there's something I didn't realize about Son of the Mask. I've never seen that whole movie start
[5042.78s -> 5049.21s]  to finish even, even 10, 20 years ago, whatever, when it came out. The, the, the actor would,
[5049.21s -> 5055.85s]  would Jamie Kennedy, right? He only puts the mask on like twice in the whole fucking movie.
[5055.85s -> 5064.41s]  That whole movie is the, is a cartoon baby versus the dog. He puts the mask on twice in the whole
[5064.41s -> 5069.21s]  movie. He puts it on the very beginning and then at the very end, he doesn't ever put the mask on.
[5070.01s -> 5075.18s]  What the hell? The dog has the mask on in the movie more than he does. What do you mean spoilers?
[5075.18s -> 5097.72s]  Nobody cares. Stop spoiling Son of the Mask. I didn't tell you the plot of the movie. I just
[5097.72s -> 5107.78s]  told you that the, the, all right. So Jim Carrey was the mask, right? And oh my God, it's one of
[5107.78s -> 5114.02s]  the best movies ever made, right? And we all can agree on that. That's, that's a simple fact, right?
[5115.06s -> 5119.78s]  I still just have to, I don't know why they made another one without having Jim Carrey be the mask.
[5119.78s -> 5140.81s]  Like, well, why would you even do it? It doesn't make any sense. Get it. This is almost done.
[5142.33s -> 5148.76s]  Movie is a really awful adaptation of the comic. Yeah, I've heard of that. That's the original.
[5148.76s -> 5167.37s]  The original comic is like kind of like dark and awful, right? All right. Looking good.
[5168.42s -> 5171.30s]  It's just, I, do I have, I have to get a hundred percent. I can't not get it.
[5171.86s -> 5180.55s]  This is going to give me a ton of money too. Oh, that's, it's better just to see this.
[5180.55s -> 5196.25s]  The comic have Jim Carrey in it. Um, wait, what? What are you talking about? No, no, it was for
[5196.25s -> 5204.38s]  money. I guess, but the only reason why it made any money is because Jim Carrey was the mask.
[5205.02s -> 5222.78s]  How am I going to get in this crevice? God damn it. I need a hundred percent. There's stuff in the
[5222.78s -> 5235.03s]  crevice. What about Sonic the Hedgehog? I thought he was good in Sonic the Hedgehog. I saw it.
[5239.99s -> 5246.26s]  This is another thing. Like look, Jim Carrey, Jim Carrey is, Jim Carrey is old now. He's like older.
[5246.26s -> 5250.02s]  I wouldn't say he's like an old man, but he's, he's like 60 or something.
[5250.66s -> 5266.04s]  Now the stuff that he was doing in his late twenties, early thirties, like Ace Ventura and
[5266.04s -> 5280.04s]  stuff. I mean, he's, he can, he's still got it. I think he's still got it. Nineties, Jim Carrey is
[5280.04s -> 5286.10s]  peak. I'll tell you, and I mean this very, very much so. If there's no Jim Carrey, there's no
[5286.10s -> 5299.61s]  Jerma. I'm serious. I don't do any of this stuff unless I thought he was really funny.
[5300.57s -> 5316.79s]  Telling you. Give me the big, the big, yeah, that one. Bro, sorry. We're going to clean up the grease.
[5317.93s -> 5326.95s]  You're a Walmart Jim Carrey. Oh, that's fine. I will never, I will never be Jim Carrey. That's
[5326.95s -> 5334.46s]  fine. Yeah. I don't care. In fact, don't even, don't even use my name in the same sentence as
[5334.46s -> 5340.78s]  Jim Carrey. Like, oh, you're a this Jim, no, no, no, don't even say that. Remove me from Jim Carrey.
[5340.78s -> 5370.02s]  That's not enough for grease. Shit. I can only get it off with this one. It feels so good. I love
[5370.02s -> 5382.28s]  this game. I know. I don't care if I keep saying it. Jim Carrey would be proud of you as their son.
[5383.70s -> 5402.50s]  All right. Now we're getting weird. This, now this is getting weird. It is now it's getting weird.
[5402.50s -> 5409.54s]  What? What did I say before that made it weird? You're just too good to be true. Can't take my
[5409.54s -> 5418.12s]  eyes off of you. I know I love you so much. I can't. I'm going to watch it again tonight.
[5434.70s -> 5451.70s]  FAD. Watch that scene on stream. I can't. DMCA exists, guys. I can't do that. What do you say?
[5451.70s -> 5457.46s]  Am I going to what? What did that person say? Am I going to what? Are you going to go on schooled?
[5458.81s -> 5483.00s]  Um, what do you mean schooled? Joe Biden is the son of the mask. Ms. Kiff's show. Oh, oh, okay.
[5483.64s -> 5501.45s]  Did I admit? Does he want me to do it? Are you guys just saying this? Is this, hold on, is this
[5501.45s -> 5505.69s]  one of those things where like you get the streamer to say the other streamer's name,
[5505.69s -> 5509.69s]  so then the other streamer then has to say and like react to me because I said the streamer's
[5509.69s -> 5523.18s]  name? Is that what we're doing? Or did he actually say this? Ego Andy. I didn't say. What are you
[5523.18s -> 5548.97s]  talking about? What about a banana? He said he hates you. No, he didn't. I know that for a fact.
[5548.97s -> 5559.06s]  I just watched that scene from Son of the Mask and it sucks. I know. So why don't you watch the
[5559.06s -> 5564.38s]  whole movie to just here's the thing. I don't even hate watch stuff. That would be classified
[5564.38s -> 5572.63s]  as hate watching, right? I don't even hate watch it. I'm like happy that I'm there experiencing it.
[5573.35s -> 5581.66s]  I don't know. It's weird. It's not hate watching because I don't hate it. I'm just so intrigued by
[5581.66s -> 5604.06s]  it. Does that make sense? That looks good, right? Oh, no. Whoa, what the fuck? You can prone like
[5604.06s -> 5611.93s]  Cod. Well, I'll say the same thing I say every time about like collabing with other people.
[5613.05s -> 5619.69s]  As you all know, I do collabs when I think they make sense or if there's a thing I think would be
[5619.69s -> 5627.80s]  fun. I do things with other people sometimes. I, the most part is just me. I don't know. I'm
[5627.80s -> 5634.34s]  not against doing anything with anybody. It just, I usually do things alone. We've talked about other
[5634.34s -> 5639.91s]  streamers before. If it sounds like something fun, sounds like something I'd want to do, I'll do it.
[5640.55s -> 5668.22s]  That's it. There's no other motive or anything. Mr. Incredible One. What if it happened to the
[5668.22s -> 5676.44s]  card game? Are you talking about Grotto Beasts? The card? The real card packs that yield the real
[5676.44s -> 5680.52s]  cards you'll be able to open very soon? Is that what you're referring to? You're talking about
[5680.52s -> 5687.32s]  the Grotto Beasts cards that you'll be able to buy and have in real life soon? Is that what you're
[5687.32s -> 5716.58s]  referring to? Yeah, I mean, that's not, it's not ready yet, but it will be very soon. It'll be soon.
[5716.58s -> 5723.06s]  He always says soon. Yeah, soon could mean whenever. It can, it's soon is soon. Soon is when you get it.
[5724.39s -> 5731.69s]  Soon. Okay, listen. Soon means real. That's all you need to know. Soon means it's real.
[5732.25s -> 5748.76s]  All right, that's good. That one's done. Wait, this backyard's done. It looked like a pretty good
[5748.76s -> 5779.78s]  backyard. What if there's a bird in here? You're causing from Boston. God damn it. I don't want
[5779.78s -> 5787.46s]  to hurt the bird in here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Everybody get ready. It's
[5787.46s -> 5794.81s]  time. Shoot the target in front of you and ready go. Fuck. Now I lost. God damn it.
[5795.88s -> 5802.52s]  That kid next to me did it perfectly fine. But I'm just, don't just let go. Why even do it anymore?
[5802.52s -> 5808.78s]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to get to the end. Why even, why even continue if you didn't get it
[5808.78s -> 5831.37s]  the first time? Probably should have been mine. Term is bad in Amusement Park games. No, that
[5831.37s -> 5837.02s]  happens every time. If you are doing that game and there's 10 of you there and you're ready,
[5837.02s -> 5841.26s]  you're lining it up and it's like, and start. It's over. You lost. You've lost. It's over.
[5841.99s -> 5846.31s]  You've lost. If you end up, like we all do, there's one person that gets it right and they win.
[5857.11s -> 5885.34s]  Gosh. What the fuck? What the fuck? Are you kidding me? Who wrote this? Who wrote that? What the
[5885.34s -> 5900.31s]  heck are you doing? Oh my God. That's so funny. Wait, I don't want to do that last. Is this done?
[5900.31s -> 5957.06s]  What? How am I supposed to get in there? Really? Underneath. Oh shit. I'm hurting the bird.
[5957.06s -> 5975.82s]  Ms. Kiff, I'll do it. I don't even know what I just agreed to. Why don't you be like, oh yeah,
[5975.82s -> 5986.87s]  yeah, what's going to happen is, oh no. What do you mean oh no? No, I'm not invited. Did you guys
[5986.87s -> 6005.61s]  just gaslight me? Oh no, now I look like a fucking idiot. Like accepting an invitation I was
[6006.17s -> 6012.87s]  never invited to. Oh man. All right. How do I fix this? I got to fix this. What do I do?
[6013.59s -> 6026.52s]  You just self-invited? Did I? Was everybody just saying that? Just go offline, bro. Oh, I got to
[6026.52s -> 6041.13s]  go. I'm out. I'm out of here. Wait, I want to do the furniture first. Just agreeing to something
[6041.13s -> 6063.11s]  that A, I was probably never invited to and B, I don't even really know what it is. Oh, I like the
[6063.11s -> 6083.64s]  umbrella. Little bro, apologize. Your ego is showing. Is it? I didn't do anything. What did I do?
[6083.64s -> 6089.91s]  Did I do something? Is being like a 20k Andy like fucking up my brain? I don't know. Is it?
[6090.71s -> 6120.95s]  What do I do? White noise. Ms. Kip just said yes. Next week. Next week? What do I have to do?
[6121.59s -> 6133.08s]  I have to travel or something? What do we do? What? All right. Stop. All right. I stopped lying.
[6133.08s -> 6141.56s]  Stop lying. Are they lying? I just got pity invited. No, don't say that. All right. I'm
[6141.56s -> 6145.80s]  going to stop addressing it. And if it's real, then I'll figure it out. If it's not real, then
[6145.80s -> 6149.48s]  it was fun. And I'm sure it's a fucking awesome show. I really think it's probably really fun.
[6150.20s -> 6173.90s]  You're old enough to be their grandpa. Am I? How old am I? They're saying you have
[6173.90s -> 6186.30s]  to come in as the sus guy. They want the sus guy? No, they don't. That would be hilarious
[6186.30s -> 6201.90s]  if they actually did though. He said hello. Well, I say hello back. Why is this like,
[6202.78s -> 6208.46s]  okay. Oh, can you tell, can you tell them that I said hi and I think they're cool?
[6208.46s -> 6214.71s]  You just go tell them. I don't want to be your messenger. No, you do it. Right? I'm saying it.
[6214.71s -> 6223.66s]  Hey, what's up, Mizkif? How you doing? Hope things are going well. He's not even live.
[6225.62s -> 6240.47s]  Oh, I'm being gassed. Yeah, I'm being gassed. All right. This is whatever. Let's move on from
[6240.47s -> 6245.59s]  this. We're going to move on. I'm looking forward to. I don't even. All right. Cool.
[6246.39s -> 6250.63s]  This might be fun. I don't know. I don't even know what it is. Sure. Let's do it. What is it?
[6250.63s -> 6274.44s]  I don't know. That sounds good. You're a sussy baka. It's like. Hold on. Let me read this. It's
[6274.44s -> 6282.44s]  like. It seems pretty hype that you said, yes, he's pogging. Oh, all right. That's yeah. Cool.
[6282.44s -> 6288.34s]  What are you doing? I'm power washing. Don't waste a weekly stream. No, I would be on top
[6288.34s -> 6296.31s]  of what I was doing. It wouldn't be. I wouldn't replace anything. The quiz show on school questions.
[6296.31s -> 6317.78s]  Oh, he said it would take you 10 minutes. Are you smarter than a Twitch streamer? LOL.
[6320.14s -> 6323.90s]  Okay. Is it actually like that? Because what if I get every single question wrong? Am I going to
[6323.90s -> 6338.50s]  look bad? Oh, shit. I got to like study or something. When is this happening? I'm going to
[6338.98s -> 6344.07s]  make sure I can even do this. I might have to do it the next time they do it. If it's real.
[6344.63s -> 6356.34s]  It's today. It's not today. It's every Monday. All right. Let's hold on. I'll figure this out.
[6357.34s -> 6367.42s]  You're late. Hurry. Oh, shit. I got to get over there. What's my first question? What genus
[6368.14s -> 6386.15s]  is the canine family from? Arachnophobia. Kick him off the fucking stream. I'm gone. How's that
[6386.15s -> 6401.88s]  look? Awful. Did I hear about the new house flipper DLC? Yeah. We play every house flipper
[6401.88s -> 6417.42s]  DLC. It doesn't matter how long or short it is. You'll see it on this channel. Don't cheat. Why
[6417.42s -> 6430.54s]  would I? I'm not going to. What do you mean cheat? No, I got nothing to hide. Like really. Like if
[6430.54s -> 6435.50s]  everyone thinks I'm stupid, whatever. If I can't answer like a fourth grade, fourth grade, whatever.
[6435.50s -> 6438.60s]  If I can't answer that question, then I can't. And that's what that's the way it is.
[6442.47s -> 6461.26s]  Oh, no. I'm regressing into a fourth grader. I'm method acting. I'm getting ready. This thing. I
[6461.26s -> 6472.33s]  need an upgrade. Bad. 100 percent. He'll have you on. All right. Well, we'll figure it out. Maybe
[6472.33s -> 6477.69s]  if it's not this time, then I don't want to just fucking just jump in and be like, oh, you said yes.
[6477.69s -> 6480.97s]  OK, I'll see you tomorrow. Like, no, if they got plans, they got plans. I'll do it one of
[6480.97s -> 6486.54s]  the other times or something. I don't know. We'll figure it out. I make I have no plans, guys,
[6486.54s -> 6507.82s]  when I do anything with anybody. You come over and have lunch with me sometime.
[6509.10s -> 6523.93s]  No, I will not. I'm sorry, but I don't do that. I can help you pick out what you'll
[6524.01s -> 6546.89s]  eat for lunch today about about a turkey club. That sounds kind of good, doesn't it?
[6546.89s -> 6551.13s]  Somebody said, is this a minigame? What's the actual game? Yeah, this is a minigame.
[6552.57s -> 6554.65s]  This is a this is like a new shooter that came out.
[6555.93s -> 6559.05s]  There's like a side game where you can like actually just go power wash stuff.
[6559.69s -> 6568.92s]  It's like a backyard like like water, like battle game. You get the different nozzles.
[6568.92s -> 6572.28s]  This is like a shotgun. And it's just like you spray like each other with water,
[6572.28s -> 6577.96s]  like Super Soakers. But it is a second game that lets you kind of use all the available
[6577.96s -> 6580.92s]  stuff they use in the actual game. You can come and just power wash. It's really cool.
[6580.92s -> 6589.94s]  I'm really into it. The game is called Soaker Sloshers. But this is like a power wash thing
[6589.94s -> 6616.42s]  that they have in it, which is kind of cool. It's called Splatoon and it's real. No,
[6617.46s -> 6625.82s]  the game is called Soaker Sloshers. And I'm playing the minigame playing the minigame
[6625.82s -> 6646.57s]  of Soaker Sloshers. No, the trim here. I'm almost done. Look at this. All I have is just
[6646.57s -> 6656.47s]  this really dirty muddy thing and a little bit more of the patio. New job available.
[6657.03s -> 6664.26s]  This is like when your parents see you playing GTA and you pretend it's a different game.
[6664.98s -> 6671.77s]  What do you mean? Like you're in you're playing the golf or something
[6673.27s -> 6688.76s]  in GTA and you just say you're playing a golf game. You're gonna do more DOS?
[6688.76s -> 6698.06s]  Probably eventually. It's not now. There's always there's always time for DOS.
[6698.62s -> 6716.09s]  Those games are never going away. This umbrella is filthy. You just pretend GTA is a race game,
[6716.09s -> 6725.94s]  racing game. Yeah, but then you have to play really well. Oh, no. Yeah. What are you playing
[6725.94s -> 6731.88s]  in here? Oh, it's just a racing game. Oh, and then you don't realize like you're watching
[6731.88s -> 6737.74s]  and you just ran over like three people and like crashed. Oh, really? That's interesting.
[6737.98s -> 6750.07s]  You can there's people you can you hit someone. Oh, oops. How do you explain that one away?
[6750.07s -> 6765.80s]  You can't. I don't want to just go here and just smell this water.
[6765.80s -> 6770.92s]  I want. OK, so I want to be standing here. I want to be standing right here.
[6770.92s -> 6777.02s]  I want someone to go like this, bounce it. So this vapor goes right into my face
[6778.10s -> 6806.70s]  and I can just sit there and just so dirty under here. Savory. No, it's a it's just water vapor
[6806.70s -> 6831.21s]  that I just like to be near. Oh, I don't vape. I find it disgusting. Don't do that shit. OK,
[6831.21s -> 6838.30s]  like this is a public service announcement. Don't cut that out. Cut that out. Cut it out.
[6838.86s -> 6855.46s]  Shut up, Dad. No, cut it out. Cut that shit out. Cut it out. If you're thinking about quitting,
[6855.46s -> 6863.61s]  you're thinking about make this be the time you do it. Make this be the make this be it.
[6864.25s -> 6880.39s]  That's it. That's just it. That's it. What a shitty PSA. Hey, German 985 here.
[6880.39s -> 6884.47s]  Just want to say if you vape, just cut cut it out. Cut that shit out. Stop doing that.
[6885.50s -> 6917.51s]  All right. Done. Don't do that anymore. I need a wider nozzle. Is this a let's see.
[6918.07s -> 6950.62s]  Yeah, this is getting it. Damn it. I screwed it up. What if I power washed a real patio?
[6951.18s -> 6967.18s]  Would you guys watch it? Would you like if I if I just like tried to find somebody that had like
[6967.18s -> 6972.58s]  a really like kind of dirty backyard and dirty house? I just did it for free. I was like, hey,
[6972.58s -> 6977.14s]  can I like just power wash your whole entire yard and do and take into clean up your whole house?
[6977.94s -> 6983.19s]  Yeah, you just have to let me film in your house or on your like property.
[6983.19s -> 6987.62s]  I don't need anything else. I don't care about anything else. You think people would do that?
[6988.26s -> 6993.26s]  And I would sign a death waiver, too. You know what I mean? So don't worry about that. It'd be
[6993.26s -> 6997.78s]  like, oh, what about that? I would sign like a death waiver. I guess like a fucking piano
[6997.78s -> 7024.87s]  fell on me or something. Don't worry. Almost done. This is a little bit more of that. And then just
[7024.87s -> 7038.01s]  this really muddy, dirty area here. I think I would be pretty good at that. I really think
[7038.01s -> 7058.58s]  I would do a pretty good job. Eat the BTS meal. What's what's the BTS meal? What it puts in it?
[7069.50s -> 7077.99s]  McNuggets, the 10 piece nugget with sauce. That sounds fucking great. I love the nuggets.
[7078.71s -> 7094.62s]  I'm a huge McNugget guy, so that meal that I would eat that. I do have a question, though. So
[7096.01s -> 7099.37s]  a lot of people have meals at McDonald's, right? It's like, oh, this meal, this like
[7100.09s -> 7104.73s]  these musicians or this these actors or is it going to get we're going to get to a point where
[7105.66s -> 7112.25s]  just the regular McDonald's meal is just like celebrities. Instead of ordering like a Big Mac,
[7112.25s -> 7123.58s]  you order like the kind of like, you know, like the Larry David sandwich. Like, oh,
[7123.58s -> 7128.86s]  you're just on the board. It's like it's Larry David. It's not like a like a whitefish sandwich.
[7128.86s -> 7140.78s]  It's the Larry David. I do love nuggets, though. What's the sauce? What's what's the difference?
[7141.50s -> 7153.66s]  What's the what do you get for ordering that? It's like some Cajun sauce. Wait, is that did they
[7153.66s -> 7167.16s]  have it? Really? It's a cage like a chili sauce. Cajun sauce. Holy shit. That sounds really good.
[7167.88s -> 7184.57s]  And a new sauce. All right. I kind of want that. It's a new sauce. Oh, shit. OK.
[7205.10s -> 7209.98s]  Eat it live on stream. I'm just going to enjoy it. My own time. I don't want to eat on stream.
[7209.98s -> 7226.70s]  I don't want to eat on stream. No, I want to enjoy my food on my own time.
[7229.30s -> 7232.10s]  Go ahead. Call me a coward. That's why I don't want to eat on camera.
[7240.97s -> 7278.73s]  Do it as Catboy. I'm going to have to ask Catboy. It's probably going to be no. I just don't like
[7278.73s -> 7283.29s]  people looking at me eating or anybody else for that matter. I don't I don't want you to look at
[7283.29s -> 7291.53s]  me chewing and hearing like that. I'm going to make me laugh and I'm going to go. I don't want
[7291.53s -> 7295.77s]  that to happen. Like someone's going to make me laugh really hard. I'm going to have french fries
[7295.77s -> 7301.46s]  in my mouth and I'm going to go. I fucking don't want that. No.
[7345.32s -> 7349.54s]  I got to get in the crevices. What's that from? I already talked about it.
[7351.88s -> 7373.14s]  I got to get inside all these crevices like this. 15 million off the dead if you eat nuggets as
[7373.14s -> 7395.78s]  Catboy. That's not worth it. That's not going to make a dent. 200 million. No, no.
[7402.18s -> 7414.70s]  Guys, I don't even know where Catboy is. I don't even know. I have no idea. Half the characters
[7414.70s -> 7419.13s]  that are made just fuck off and they just disappear into the woods and shit. I don't even know where
[7419.13s -> 7473.05s]  they go. Some of them we see. Where did what? Who made Bugleberry? I don't know. I met Bugleberry.
[7473.05s -> 7499.27s]  I found him on like Craigslist. I don't know who made Bugleberry. I hired him. Come on and read
[7499.27s -> 7507.54s]  some scary stories. That's what it said he did and he was really, really kind of an interesting
[7507.54s -> 7510.66s]  guy. So I was like, Oh, I kind of, maybe you'll come back or something. Do some more stuff.
[7511.96s -> 7515.80s]  He did like kids birthday parties and everything. There was, he had a whole thing.
[7516.52s -> 7542.54s]  I don't know where he's from. I am almost done. You're right. What about chrome face? He's got
[7542.54s -> 7552.78s]  these fucking urns, dude. I don't know. I don't know what any of that stuff is. He create, he
[7552.78s -> 7562.58s]  doesn't just make characters for me. He makes them for himself and he does like summoning courses
[7562.58s -> 7567.30s]  and stuff and I don't know. I don't know what his daily life is like. I just know that sometimes
[7567.30s -> 7573.96s]  I bring him on to make characters. This really weird guy, but he's does, he's good at what he
[7573.96s -> 7603.27s]  does. All right. I'm almost ready to do the really dirty one. Why are all of his characters a version
[7603.27s -> 7629.48s]  of me? Well, cause I don't know. Sometimes I don't feel like fucking streaming and I don't know.
[7630.68s -> 7632.84s]  He's been making different like characters and different stuff.
[7637.30s -> 7640.82s]  He has like whatever he has. He makes it however he does it. I don't know. I don't know.
[7641.54s -> 7646.82s]  You think I've watched bugleberry streams? Are you out of your fucking mind? Those streams are
[7646.82s -> 7653.32s]  horrible. I always leave when he comes on. Why do you think I've watched a bugleberry stream?
[7653.32s -> 7673.93s]  It's bizarre that you have. Yeah. If I know he's going to be on, I'll just like
[7673.93s -> 7676.89s]  go to the bathroom or something or make some food or just come back and see when he's gone.
[7678.87s -> 7682.87s]  He's a smart guy. He's a, he's an interesting guy, but I just don't want to watch him stream.
[7683.51s -> 7706.98s]  Oh, this is going to be horrible. Look at, look at all these crevices. I think I can do the big
[7706.98s -> 7725.21s]  one for this one, right? Nope. God damn it. Green one? Yeah. Why does he stream? Because like I've
[7725.21s -> 7730.30s]  told him a long time ago that he could do stuff on camera if he wanted to. And part of me hiring
[7730.30s -> 7734.22s]  him required that he was going to be able to participate in some of the streams that I do.
[7735.18s -> 7750.54s]  Where some of the broadcasting hours, right? What was the charity that bugleberry donated to?
[7751.34s -> 7758.70s]  Uh, that's actually a work in progress. I'll let you guys know exactly the exact amount and what
[7758.70s -> 7798.38s]  charity it is. But no, I'm not, you'll hear about that soon. You're going to pocket it? I'm not
[7798.38s -> 7804.62s]  going to pocket it. No, I'm not going to do that. I'll, I'll give you the very specifics on all that
[7804.62s -> 7812.22s]  stuff. I'm not just going to be like, yay. Donated it to charity. Yep. That, yeah, I did. No, I'm not
[7812.22s -> 7826.94s]  going to do that. I'll give you guys exact specifics of what it is. What just happened?
[7826.94s -> 7831.16s]  Why did it clean it for me? I had like a whole section left. What did it do that for?
[7832.30s -> 7856.90s]  Wait, what? Free cleaning. Yeah. That doesn't mean cool. What's on this roof that's so,
[7857.54s -> 7904.95s]  where is it? Doghouse roof. Where? Come on. Ah, thank God. Did I get the rest of the doghouse?
[7904.95s -> 7922.36s]  I think I did, yeah. Use eagle vision. I keep forgetting I have that. No, don't spray that.
[7922.44s -> 7945.29s]  Stop. Somebody said I hate this game. Why? This is awesome. This is super relaxing. We hate games
[7945.29s -> 7952.76s]  now? Well, you're probably going to hate them even more when the Ubisoft conference happens.
[7952.76s -> 7965.00s]  That was uncalled for, uncalled for. Why did it do that? That was uncalled for. That was uncalled
[7965.00s -> 7969.40s]  for. I don't, why did I say that? I think it's because I hated Watch Dogs Legion so much
[7970.20s -> 7980.31s]  that I just had to say that. He hates Ubisoft? Yes, I do. Do you want me to, should I just pretend
[7980.31s -> 7989.40s]  like I don't? I do. But that's like, that's a very strong way to word it. I don't hate Ubisoft.
[7990.47s -> 7996.94s]  I just hate all their games. No, let me try that again. I don't, I just don't really like their
[7996.94s -> 8016.95s]  games. Okay. I've had fun with some of their games. Some of them. But for the most part,
[8016.95s -> 8024.49s]  when an Ubisoft title comes out, I just go, no, I don't care. I just, I don't, it doesn't do it
[8024.49s -> 8046.79s]  for me. Hate is too strong of a word though, because I really don't. All right, I want to get
[8046.79s -> 8060.79s]  right to the middle. Feels good. All right. Wait, I forgot these. This will take 10 minutes? Yeah,
[8060.79s -> 8070.57s]  but I'm, I'm being thorough. I'm being very thorough. I don't just wanna, I just yawned.
[8071.94s -> 8078.78s]  I tried to hide it. I think that's from the headache though. That's not because I'm tired,
[8078.78s -> 8082.78s]  or I'm bored. That's from the headache. You know when you get like a really yawny headache?
[8084.01s -> 8101.80s]  That's what it is. I swear to God, I'm not bored. I love this so much. I just have a little migraine.
[8101.80s -> 8110.06s]  It's starting to evolve into a big migraine, which is annoying, but I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
[8110.06s -> 8123.74s]  I'll be good. Too much CBD? I have not taken any CBD today. Or yesterday, or the day before,
[8123.74s -> 8160.54s]  or the day before, or the day before. Oh Jesus. Bong water? I don't smoke out of a bong. I don't
[8160.54s -> 8185.40s]  smoke weed. I don't smoke weed. I don't. I got four stars already. Damn, this is dirty. It's
[8185.40s -> 8224.10s]  one dollar for the car seat? Are you kidding me? So many cracks. Get the majority and it'll auto
[8224.10s -> 8253.93s]  complete? Oh, still dirty. No, spin it. It does do that, doesn't it? It does, doesn't it? Okay,
[8253.93s -> 8271.53s]  cool. Final thing is, oh, the shed. Drink lots of water? Yeah, I got water right here. Somebody
[8271.53s -> 8283.38s]  said, have I ever unironically, not joking, smoked crack? I have not unironically smoked crack. How
[8283.38s -> 8292.79s]  do you, how do you ironically smoke crack? What are you talking about? Have you ever unironically
[8292.79s -> 8327.05s]  smoked crack? All right, shed door, shed roof. How did I not get that? If you ever smoked crack,
[8327.05s -> 8333.21s]  I would unsub. I not, don't worry about, I'm not going to smoke crack. Dude, what are you talking
[8333.21s -> 8347.02s]  about? Don't worry about that. Why would I ever tell you I smoked crack? That's not something that
[8347.02s -> 8351.51s]  I would just start with one day. Hey, what's up, guys? Yeah, starting to stream. We're going to
[8351.51s -> 8385.18s]  be playing Fable 3 today. I smoked crack today. Unironically, like I did it today. Unsub. Smoke
[8385.18s -> 8405.37s]  crack or I will unsub. I can't, I can't believe it. Okay, I'm going to move on. I'm done with that.
[8406.25s -> 8448.62s]  Do you have any fuel? I got one right here. Oh, shit. Very, very nice. I'll get the caked on sugar,
[8448.62s -> 8465.46s]  the burnt sugar. Very good. Very good. I think this is done. It is. That's it. We just have this spot
[8465.46s -> 8495.56s]  over here. I'm going to go thin nozzle. The swing, I'll get it in a minute. I fucked it up. It's
[8495.56s -> 8516.34s]  all right. I got it. Yes. I thought this is not a fire pit. This is a pool. This is a dirty fucking
[8516.34s -> 8549.43s]  pool. I'm going to stop swearing for an hour. It looks like chocolate. What's the max price for
[8549.43s -> 8583.75s]  this one? 400, 500. Oh, right to the very end. Oh, yes. Look at how much better this looks.
[8583.75s -> 8618.95s]  Am I, what am I missing? 99. The grill. Oh shit. They're at the back of the grill. This thing too.
[8618.95s -> 8696.12s]  How do I get up there? Oh, all right. 375. What? Okay. Bird house. What's left? Four. I don't see
[8696.12s -> 8736.28s]  anything. Checklist is in the menu. Okay. Status. Okay. There's one fence post. Is it? Fence post.
[8736.28s -> 8771.82s]  Which one? Oh, I got it. $485. Oh, let's see. Pretty cool. Do it again. Nice. Clean the dirt bike.
[8771.82s -> 8776.15s]  Should I buy something? This one would probably be quick. All right. This is going to be quick.
[8776.15s -> 8794.98s]  I love these quick jobs. There's so much fun. It just feels so right. You know what I mean?
[8794.98s -> 8815.82s]  We do one pass with the wide. We come down to the green. Pass with the green. Let me change the
[8815.82s -> 8840.60s]  yellow. This will be quick and efficient. All right. Nice. Other side. What's wrong with the
[8840.60s -> 8874.42s]  nozzle? The nozzle's like broken. All right. Now we do detail and that's it. The tires. Get in there.
[8874.42s -> 8910.55s]  Does distance matter? I think it does. Is that tire? Oh, underneath here. Yes. Yes. Four. Four.
[8910.55s -> 8954.58s]  Four. Squeaky clean. Come on. 96%. What's left? Oh, over here. Why am I shooting over there? Okay.
[8954.58s -> 8981.51s]  I think it's just the front of the bike. The engine. All right. 99%. Just a little bit in the guts.
[8982.07s -> 9007.93s]  No. Where the hell is it? Find out. The exhaust, the fairings, and the brake discs. Okay. Oh, what?
[9007.93s -> 9043.42s]  Brake discs? What's back here? Are they not clean? How are they not clean? What is a brake disc?
[9043.42s -> 9058.07s]  Yeah, it is. Yeah, I got it. It's those. That was quick and easy. Seventy-five dollars.
[9058.07s -> 9082.84s]  Ooh. Clean the playground. Clean the bungalow. Playground. Wait. 1250 bucks. Long extension.
[9082.84s -> 9110.90s]  Ooh. Soap. Urban X U2 turbo. Primus to 3000 turbo nozzle. Improves the range.
[9110.90s -> 9123.85s]  Shit. I bought the wrong soap one. All right. Go back. Back. Back. All right.
[9123.85s -> 9132.07s]  Cleaning liquid. I already have the multi-surface. All right. Let's go.
[9132.07s -> 9154.31s]  Need to reload the soap. All right. Let's see what I got. What do I got? I have the
[9155.59s -> 9170.47s]  this nozzle. Let me check this one. Oh, no. Where is it? Zero degree nozzle. Did I not get the...
[9170.47s -> 9188.65s]  Where is it? Where is it? Bottom left. Well, that's the soap. Didn't I buy a new nozzle?
[9188.65s -> 9204.87s]  Oh, jeez. Look at this. Whoa. Holy shit. Okay. Hold on. I don't want to fuck this up.
[9204.87s -> 9238.10s]  What's the dirtiest thing here? Soap the absolute hell out of this. Is this doing anything?
[9238.10s -> 9288.44s]  Again? Oh, it is. Okay. Rinse it with water. That works pretty good. Use the wood soap.
[9288.44s -> 9302.33s]  Oh, stone cleaner. Is this stone? What do you mean dirty? Oh, this is all-purpose. It's fine.
[9302.33s -> 9348.14s]  I gotta get up here. Is the soap actually doing anything worthwhile? I ran out of soap. No,
[9348.14s -> 9366.41s]  I didn't. I took it off. Soap is expensive. I mean, the universal soap will work on anything.
[9366.41s -> 9389.58s]  Is that working? It is. All right. I'll put that back on. Just spray the hell out of this whole
[9389.58s -> 9423.48s]  thing and then we'll rinse it. Wait, is this $15 every time it goes to zero? Is it? Let me
[9423.48s -> 9455.24s]  double check. Oh, fuck that. Yeah. I'm not using this anymore. Go down the slide. Yay. All right.
[9455.24s -> 9482.10s]  Now bring out the wash. Yeah. And let's wash. What? 8%? What? It should be higher than that.
[9482.10s -> 9499.32s]  Because all I did was use soap. Stop pretending. What are you talking about? What? What are you
[9499.32s -> 9543.93s]  talking about? What am I pretending? Not bad. Play some music. Uh, yeah. What should we put on?
[9544.25s -> 9580.39s]  What do you guys want to hear? How about the one that goes? Uh, let's see. What can I put on?
[9580.39s -> 9592.98s]  Put on. No, not doom. Something relaxing. Something we can just chill with.
[9592.98s -> 9611.21s]  Supermarket sweep. Yeah, that sounds good. Ow, my fucking head. That hurts so bad. My volume is
[9611.21s -> 9648.97s]  maxed. For you guys, that was 40% softer than what I heard. Supermarket sweep. Sounds like every
[9648.97s -> 9669.06s]  first Sonic level after 2005. Something's auto playing. I don't know what it is.
[9670.26s -> 9681.66s]  Here we go. It's the supermarket sweep main theme. Didn't we already do this like fucking
[9682.30s -> 9701.72s]  two or three years ago? Yeah. I remember this. We already did this. It's a clean in here if I can.
[9713.05s -> 9715.85s]  Same joke, Andy. No, it's been three years. That means we can do it again.
[9715.85s -> 9753.99s]  Mario Kart. It is. It is Mario Kart. It's so grimy. Super Mario Kart shop. Super Mario
[9753.99s -> 9757.19s]  shopping shop. I can't even fucking say your joke. It was funny when you said it, not me.
[9758.07s -> 9791.00s]  Fuck. Go faster. Oh, I'm trying. I can't go faster. Go faster. I said you do a shitty rush job.
[9791.64s -> 9821.66s]  I don't want to do a shitty rush job. That was a bad voice crack. That was supposed to be ding,
[9822.94s -> 9861.66s]  not ding. Look at all this crap. I wonder what are we going to get? What era of
[9861.66s -> 9892.30s]  supermarket sweep theme song are we going to get? Wheel of Fortune, actually. JRPG music. Yeah,
[9892.30s -> 9926.12s]  it is. Is this shit copyright? It probably is. These songs are probably copyright. Yeah,
[9926.12s -> 9941.05s]  this shit's copyright. I got to get rid of this. That was efficient what I was just doing. Very
[9941.05s -> 9962.54s]  efficient. All right, what's next? I'm going to skip like five times. I don't know what this is.
[9963.42s -> 9977.70s]  This is fucking awesome, whatever this is. What is this? This is called the savers?
[9981.99s -> 9993.27s]  Is this super? No, this is not a supermarket thing. This is great. What's next? Skip, skip, skip, skip,
[9993.27s -> 10003.38s]  skip, skip, skip, skip. All right, let's go to something else. That was cool.
[10004.10s -> 10042.66s]  Penis music. I'll do penis music for 10 seconds, okay? Okay, turn it off before I fucking puke.
[10050.55s -> 10066.94s]  What's next? Speedrun? What's good speedrunning music? Son of the Mask. I just want, I don't care.
[10066.94s -> 10073.29s]  I just want to play the... I have to do it. I have to. Nobody, just plug your ears for a second.
[10076.12s -> 10086.36s]  I just have to hear that one second. I don't care. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my
[10086.36s -> 10099.61s]  eyes off of you. It's the only part I want to hear, is it? That's it. That's all I wanted to see.
[10099.61s -> 10114.42s]  Okay, now what? 30 Valley? Vsauce Prime numbers. Vsauce Prime numbers. I can't believe I watched
[10114.42s -> 10124.89s]  that entire four-hour video in my sleep. No, I am not doing that. I'm not opening up that can of
[10124.89s -> 10133.94s]  worms. I'm not just gonna have counting happen. It's a great video. Katamari? I feel like we always
[10133.94s -> 10148.17s]  go back to Katamari. Always. All right, you want to go outside, Otto? I think Otto wants to go out.
[10148.17s -> 10152.73s]  I will take the first break. I'll be right back. In like two minutes while we figure out what to
[10152.73s -> 10160.30s]  play on stream. I'll be right back. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you.
[10161.02s -> 10348.10s]  You're just too good to be true. You know I love you, babe. American Bible Challenge theme song?
[10350.01s -> 10363.94s]  I, I can't like, it's hard to find that. You know, just watch like the first, come on. There it is.
[10366.17s -> 10373.82s]  I'm Jeff Foxworthy and this is the American Bible Challenge. Everybody just stand up. I can't wait.
[10373.82s -> 10379.35s]  Everybody just stand up. Everybody put your hands up. And this is American Bible Challenge.
[10397.69s -> 10403.13s]  A computer wrote that song. You know what I mean? That's like algorithmically they just made that
[10403.13s -> 10408.94s]  song. And I think that's Jeff Foxworthy singing it. I, you guys said no. I think it is. That's
[10408.94s -> 10414.38s]  definitely Jeff Foxworthy singing. And this is American Bible Challenge. The American Bible
[10414.46s -> 10420.20s]  Challenge. Everybody put your hands up. It's the, it's the same person that he, it's Jeff Foxworthy
[10420.20s -> 10434.31s]  singing it. American Bible Challenge. That's, that's him doing that. It has to be. Why would it be
[10434.31s -> 10448.39s]  anybody else? There's nobody else that could be. I love that song so much. Everybody put your hands
[10448.39s -> 10460.49s]  up. Everybody just stand up. Everybody put your hands up. Come on and stand up. Oh shit, forgot to
[10460.49s -> 10478.95s]  put music on. Clown car music? No. Kirby's Epic Yarn. Sure. I'll try. Kirby's Epic Yarn.
[10479.59s -> 10499.74s]  True. Okay. All right. Oh. Oh shit. All right. I'm getting a lot of everybody put your hands up.
[10499.74s -> 10513.82s]  Everybody just stand up vibes from this. Oh, it doesn't go, it doesn't go. All right. That
[10513.82s -> 10520.47s]  can stay on. That's fine. Drop it a little bit. It's a little loud. I'm going to drop the sounds in
[10520.47s -> 10538.41s]  this game too. I don't want to overpower the music. Yeah. I want to hear the stuff. Yeah.
[10538.41s -> 10549.40s]  There we go. Turn up the water. All right. How about the water splash sounds? Let's see.
[10551.42s -> 10565.30s]  Ah, that's still, it's way louder. That's, I think that's good. And we'll turn Kirby up.
[10565.30s -> 10570.54s]  That's a good audio level. Jerma doesn't know audio. Jerma's so bad at audio. Jerma's audio,
[10570.54s -> 10572.94s]  fucking sucks. Jerma's audio is fucking terrible. I don't like everything. If I go to Jerma's
[10572.94s -> 10588.10s]  straight, it sounds like shit. I'm working. I'm working on it. I'm trying. I wasn't an audio guy.
[10588.10s -> 10594.42s]  I was the, I was the visual guy. I can't do everything. I can't do audio and visual. I
[10594.42s -> 10608.22s]  can do visual and make the visual look all right. Is this replaying? All right. That's good. Let's
[10608.22s -> 10617.37s]  go. Everybody just stand up. Everybody put your hands up. All right. Let's clean the dinosaur.
[10618.25s -> 10634.62s]  I want to soak the fuck out of this. What the hell was that? Oh, I didn't like that. Did I do that?
[10634.62s -> 10645.45s]  What happened? What the fuck was that? Someone just dropped something on the piano. Is that in
[10645.45s -> 10673.05s]  the song? That's better. I didn't play this game. I didn't play any of the yarn games. They made
[10673.05s -> 10693.80s]  like three of them. Gotta go more than that. Let's just go yellow. Make sure we get it all.
[10694.44s -> 10703.72s]  Play them all? No, I don't think so. I think they mean they're cool and everything, but no,
[10703.72s -> 10721.67s]  I don't think so. You know why I don't want to play those games? Because if in the event that
[10721.67s -> 10728.09s]  I don't like them or I'm just like, eh, I don't want to sour how I feel about the way they look.
[10728.73s -> 10733.24s]  Is it the games or is it just like, eh, if I'm not into the game,
[10734.26s -> 10737.06s]  I don't want there to be a scenario where I talk a bunch of shit about it and I talk about how the
[10737.06s -> 10763.91s]  game sucks. I'd rather just enjoy it from afar. Nice and clean. All right. Looking good. Somebody
[10763.91s -> 10772.15s]  mentioned speed running. I can't wait to see people speed run this game. Right? I feel like
[10772.15s -> 10789.42s]  if you want a challenge, this is, this is, this would be very hard to speed run. Cool. Resident
[10789.42s -> 10818.90s]  sleeper. All right. Come on. My stairs look good. Doing it in one pass feels great. All right.
[10818.90s -> 10840.49s]  What's next on Kirby's epic yarn? Oh, I'm done with this one. I'm skipping ahead. All right.
[10840.49s -> 10864.20s]  Okay. This is same OST. What did I do? What just happened? What happened? Where am I? What? I feel
[10864.20s -> 10870.76s]  like this one's going to be quick. All right. Let's see how fast I can do this one. Start timing.
[10872.36s -> 10885.70s]  10 minutes from right now and I'm done. Oh, this is pretty thick dirt.
[10885.78s -> 10914.07s]  I think I need upgrades for this one. I might be able to get it. Shit. I gotta keep it in the
[10914.07s -> 10936.02s]  right spot. I gotta be like a 3d printing machine. Come on. I clean the rest of that shit up later.
[10936.02s -> 10984.46s]  It's all right. Oh, come on. It's still so dirty. How did I miss that much? I need a better washer.
[10984.46s -> 11007.98s]  Yes, I do. I'll get it after this though. Kirby's epic yarn. Yeah, that's was requested. We do
[11007.98s -> 11025.98s]  soundtrack nights like right now and you'll get what you want eventually. Got it. All right. Oh,
[11026.30s -> 11034.71s]  boy. It's a lot. All right. I need to get on the roof up and down or left and right up and down.
[11034.71s -> 11075.13s]  This is some kid shit. This is some kid shit. I hope this is relaxing. This is supposed to be a
[11075.13s -> 11084.26s]  relaxing stream. While you're on the couch, just open one eye and then you'll see, oh, where is he
[11084.26s -> 11103.06s]  now? Oh, he's doing the garage door and then just go back to bed. I'm being pretty meticulous. I'm
[11103.06s -> 11132.04s]  already at 13%. This is good. What did I say? 10 minutes. How long has it been? Three and four.
[11132.04s -> 11169.85s]  Okay, I'm getting there. Hey, get on here. Hey, hey, please play Super Paper Mario. Oh, you know
[11169.85s -> 11175.93s]  what? You know what? That person's right because I'm never going to play Super Paper Mario on the
[11175.93s -> 11199.85s]  stream. I'll put the Super Paper Mario OST on the stream. That's fair, right? I think that's fair.
[11207.83s -> 11228.15s]  That one's good. Over here. Yep. That's just ready. See, I like this one. This one's simple.
[11228.15s -> 11266.14s]  It's a big cube. Oh, that's much better. I got to get closer though. How much is left?
[11266.94s -> 11280.89s]  That's way too much. Play the Among Us theme song with them and it goes
[11303.35s -> 11310.23s]  Yes, that one. I just did it. I don't need to put it on. People still play Among Us.
[11310.23s -> 11327.90s]  Or is it over yet? Is it a dead game? I don't, it's probably, I don't think it's a dead game.
[11328.46s -> 11352.36s]  It's really popular still. Play Persona 5. I don't want to, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to
[11352.36s -> 11365.29s]  get on the roof. Can I turn this clown music? Oh, this is Mario Party. I don't know. What game is it?
[11365.93s -> 11378.39s]  I'm not going to play Persona. That's like a 60 hour game. You're never going to see a game
[11378.39s -> 11384.70s]  on this stream that's more than 20 hours. Top. I stream once a week, twice a week sometimes.
[11384.70s -> 11414.52s]  It's not going to happen. I have to be honest. I have to be real. 21, almost there. Oh, what's this
[11414.52s -> 11445.34s]  song? The green one, I don't have, there's no use for the green one. It's either the white or the
[11445.34s -> 11477.70s]  yellow. The green one sucks. I want to use the soap. Oh, that's so good here. Holy shit. That's
[11477.70s -> 11506.98s]  so good here. Wow. All right. That's good. Soap the hell out of the whole house and then I'll rinse
[11506.98s -> 11556.57s]  it. Time's up. It's been 10 minutes. Oh shit. Oh well. Got to go green. Stone cleaner. Oh shit.
[11556.57s -> 11566.09s]  All right. They're good. I can't tell this is, this is good, right? That's pretty, kind of good.
[11566.09s -> 11587.46s]  Let me just say play Lisa. Play Lisa. I swear to God, some of you guys have bots and come into
[11587.46s -> 11598.42s]  this channel and just write that. It's probably at least two or three accounts at once every month.
[11599.88s -> 11631.35s]  Just paste it. Let's just set up as an algorithm. Is this stone? Turn the webcam on. No,
[11631.91s -> 11636.09s]  I'm not a webcam streamer. I'm a web, no, I'm a webcam streamer with an asterisk.
[11642.44s -> 11654.70s]  Only when it makes sense. It doesn't have to be on all the time. Nice. Makes sense right now. No,
[11654.70s -> 11675.74s]  it doesn't. Please. I would love a webcam. No, I like this song. Let's see how it goes.
[11676.30s -> 11707.53s]  How can he be so mean when playing his dream game? I just don't want to put a webcam on.
[11707.53s -> 11743.34s]  Stop fucking asking for it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, I know. 50% of this whole place is a roof.
[11743.34s -> 11760.97s]  Oh Jesus. Are you kidding me? It's a ladder. Hey, Rick and Morty season four coming up.
[11760.97s -> 11789.16s]  Saw the trailer. Everybody else excited? So if I, this is what I understand. If all of you hate
[11789.16s -> 11806.46s]  this show, who's watching the show? You know what I'm saying? Redditors? But aren't redditors,
[11807.98s -> 11815.72s]  what? I don't know. Wait, so what are you guys? What are you guys? Are you twitchers?
[11816.44s -> 11834.41s]  Twitch viewers? What? Neck beards. So if you guys aren't redditors, do you guys
[11834.41s -> 11849.82s]  only hang around on Twitch? I don't buy that. I don't buy that. Who's your favorite Twitch?
[11849.82s -> 11855.21s]  I can't even talk. Who's your favorite Twitch streamer then? You like Twitch so much. Who's
[11855.21s -> 11877.53s]  your favorite streamer? Okay. Okay. There's too much going on on this one. Yep. That's better.
[11880.84s -> 11896.50s]  You're a fan of Twitch. Name every Twitch streamer. That's what I'm saying. All right.
[11896.50s -> 11921.38s]  44%. Let's go with this guy. Let's do a quick coding. Let me get the power. Door is going to
[11921.38s -> 11944.34s]  be done. Door is going to be done. Okay. Cool. Yes. Yes. Yes. Please play the Pikachu soundtrack.
[11944.90s -> 11995.11s]  Pikachu has his own soundtrack. Yes. Yes. Yes. I think it's just a roof down here a little.
[11995.11s -> 12023.37s]  All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. He's still dirty,
[12023.37s -> 12068.55s]  but on Nier Automata. Nier Automata. Oh, shit. All right. This is good. This is Nier. This
[12068.55s -> 12085.90s]  sounds good. Oh, wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry. Nier Automata. Nier Automata full OST.
[12097.18s -> 12134.71s]  Nier gets copyright strikes from YouTube. Oh, well. Something else. What's next? How about...
[12134.71s -> 12142.38s]  It's been 20 minutes. You're still not done. Yeah, but this is, this is flowing.
[12142.38s -> 12147.26s]  Play Lisa. Play Lisa the Painful. You should play Lisa the Painful. You should play Lisa the
[12147.26s -> 12154.44s]  Painful and just stream it. It should be like a exclamation point Lisa that just says I will
[12154.44s -> 12170.62s]  never play Lisa the Painful. But then I can put it in when the bots put it in. Pokemon? Yeah,
[12170.62s -> 12179.51s]  Pokemon battle music. That sounds good to me. Pokemon hype mix battle music. Get hyped with
[12179.51s -> 12196.26s]  this compilation of some of the best battle songs from the Pokemon OST. It's pretty, I, I, I get it.
[12196.26s -> 12236.57s]  Here we go. Is this in the... Okay, this is not in Pokemon. This song is not in Pokemon.
[12236.57s -> 12248.09s]  This is somebody remixed it. This is that song that goes...
[12254.33s -> 12262.79s]  This is a, uh, what is it? Chemical, the Chemical Brothers? No, who is it?
[12280.57s -> 12289.29s]  That's this song. Firestarter, right? There it is. I'm a firestarter. Mr. Firestarter.
[12298.31s -> 12328.10s]  Prodigy, yeah, all right. This is not in Pokemon. I know that for a fact. This is literally Pokemon.
[12328.10s -> 12354.89s]  I don't believe you. This is from Gen 8. I don't like this. This, this, this is not...
[12354.89s -> 12366.70s]  This is the only kind of Pokemon music I like. I don't like new things. I don't like new things,
[12366.70s -> 12426.20s]  like old things from 1995. This is not even in Pokemon. Oh, where is it? Where's the one I like?
[12426.20s -> 12449.05s]  Oh, where's the one that I like? This is not the Hedgehog. I like this though. I just hear
[12449.05s -> 12469.59s]  the blast processing sound. It's gonna be too hard to get these. All right, I can do this.
[12469.59s -> 12494.22s]  Yeah, this is awesome. I really like this one a lot. This thing sucks. I need a better nozzle.
[12497.02s -> 12524.94s]  I feel like I can beat this level. All right, this is almost... Come on, it's done. Give it to me.
[12530.54s -> 12553.35s]  Where'd it go? Oh, whatever. I'm going up. No, no, no. I want... I mean, this is... This playlist is
[12553.35s -> 12582.10s]  cool. Here we go. Yep, this is it. This is exactly what I was looking for. That's not... No, that's not
[12582.10s -> 12618.63s]  it. Not it. Is this it? No, I want the one from Brawl. What's the one from Brawl? Gen 2? Is it?
[12618.63s -> 12661.98s]  I think this is it. Fake Andy. What? Brawl soundtrack is fire. The Brawl soundtrack is
[12661.98s -> 12669.88s]  way better than all the other Smash Brothers soundtracks. It is equivocally the best one
[12669.88s -> 12682.34s]  they've ever made. I... Nothing compares. It was so much better than everything else. Say what you...
[12682.34s -> 12687.50s]  Brawl... You might think Brawl sucks, but the music in Brawl was totally better than anything
[12687.50s -> 12702.01s]  else they've ever done. If all... Oh, fuck that. Let's just put on the Brawl OST. Fuck that.
[12702.73s -> 12713.11s]  That's the one I want to hear. Do you remember this one when you were... Remember when you heard
[12713.11s -> 12739.03s]  this? This one was the... This is one of the best songs in the whole soundtrack. Calm down, man.
[12741.43s -> 12769.16s]  I don't think I timed out for one minute. This is a perfect soundtrack for what we're doing.
[12769.16s -> 12774.50s]  Just to... This is a coloring book. This is a pro tip for all you guys that have trouble coloring
[12774.50s -> 12782.58s]  books. Always fill in the edges first so then you can't color outside the lines. Go a half
[12782.58s -> 12801.70s]  inch around so then that's your new line so you'll never color outside the lines. You're going so
[12801.70s -> 12811.62s]  slow. Oh, I... What are you... I'm not going slow, right? I mean, I am right now because I'm trying... I
[12811.62s -> 12841.62s]  can't move that fast for some reason on the roof. It's another good one. Don't fall. I won't. I'm
[12841.62s -> 12849.45s]  good. All right. Now we colored inside the lines. Now we go like this. I can probably do green for
[12849.45s -> 12867.45s]  this one. You know what's funny? This would probably be the background music for this video.
[12867.45s -> 12875.42s]  If I was going to have this on YouTube and I'm like a power washing guy channel, this is probably
[12875.42s -> 12913.24s]  what it would be. Do soap on the roof. Oh shit. That's good. Another classic. Another one. Every
[12913.24s -> 12920.39s]  single song on the Brawl... Can I... Why do I... Whatever. Every single soundtrack on the... Oh my
[12920.39s -> 12928.18s]  God. Every single... The song is speech jamming me. Every single song on the Brawl soundtrack
[12928.18s -> 12936.86s]  was good. I never skipped one of them. They were all good.
[12962.70s -> 12984.42s]  All right. We're at 69%. Everybody yellow L real quick. This is like a weird SpongeBob Mario
[12984.42s -> 13023.13s]  mashup. Oh my fucking God. Stop. No swearing. Imagine all the junk that would be in there.
[13023.13s -> 13059.10s]  Get it. Oh, whatever. Why am I missing on this roof? Oh, it's so dirty. Filthy over here.
[13059.66s -> 13099.37s]  Is that Wario? I think it's Wario. Is it... Am I going fast enough for you now? That's a better speed,
[13099.37s -> 13112.50s]  don't you think? Soap? I don't need it. I'll use soap when I get the better nozzle. I'm still
[13112.50s -> 13134.28s]  using the original power washer. This thing kind of sucks. Really need 1200? How many... There's a
[13134.36s -> 13150.02s]  lot of Mario songs on the Brawl track, aren't there? I didn't realize there were this many.
[13150.02s -> 13170.76s]  S1? Yeah, this is really good too. 74%. Come on. Come on. You know what I'm... Come on. Say it.
[13170.76s -> 13181.40s]  Come on. Come on. That's when I hold the microphone out to the audience and everyone goes,
[13182.28s -> 13197.35s]  when? We kind of wanted to make a fake advertisement for like a comedy DVD or comedy CD.
[13199.50s -> 13204.14s]  And there's a huge audience and it's like the announcer guy, the infomercial guy is like it
[13204.14s -> 13210.47s]  and such antics as. It's this little routine of little stream jokes. Like an audience.
[13211.19s -> 13221.93s]  Just make a little infomercial of a fake CD that doesn't exist. Relive all those classic moments.
[13222.49s -> 13227.72s]  Like, come on, Gwyn. Oh, come on. Come on, Gwyn. And everybody's fucking is cackling in the
[13227.72s -> 13243.75s]  audience. And they also brought like the vault. We got access to the German 95 vault
[13245.34s -> 13266.49s]  after his estate got it. Yeah, like they got access to my vault. Wait, am I supposed to be dead?
[13268.73s -> 13302.38s]  Shit, yeah. Fuck, I didn't want to fall off. Clean, clean, clean. This is going to be a huge
[13302.38s -> 13337.93s]  chunk. This roof. How about, was it 80%? Somebody get this guy a harness. You're not safe from a
[13337.93s -> 13347.16s]  fall joke even in this game. No, you're not. You're always at risk to hear a fall joke. I see a fall
[13347.16s -> 13374.60s]  joke no matter what we're doing. Oh fuck, whatever. That tree has a smile. The tree is fucking laughing
[13374.60s -> 13404.50s]  at me right there. I didn't even do any of this. All right, let's do this. I'll finish with the
[13404.50s -> 13412.82s]  roof. What about like dinosaur playground place? Can I go back and do that again? Hopefully it's
[13412.82s -> 13435.77s]  not reset. That would be really annoying if it was. What's this from? Mario's way cooler than Mickey
[13435.77s -> 13444.23s]  Mouse. I'm sorry. If you want to have the thing that is just the universal, everybody loves it.
[13444.23s -> 13451.94s]  Everyone. It's Super Mario. Like it's not Mickey Mouse. Fuck that guy. Donald Duck is way better
[13451.94s -> 13473.77s]  anyways. I can't think of anything. When you hear the word Super Mario, you don't think, all you
[13473.77s -> 13479.88s]  think about is, oh that's, I feel very happy right now. I feel at peace for just a moment. Even just
[13479.88s -> 13490.22s]  a moment. When you hear Mickey Mouse, you also feel some joy for a moment. Mickey Mouse. Oh,
[13490.94s -> 13498.38s]  Mickey Mouse. And then you realize it's four dollars for a water at Disney. And it's, yep,
[13499.34s -> 13521.05s]  it gets a little sour in your mouth for a second. Because it must be on sale.
[13521.85s -> 13528.38s]  How much is a bottle of water at like Disneyland? Does anybody know? Just like a Dasani bottle of
[13528.38s -> 13545.67s]  water. Is it five bucks? Is it four bucks? Probably five bucks. Yeah, it probably is.
[13546.31s -> 13570.55s]  3.75, 3.50. Let's go to a water fountain. So when does the copyright run out for Mickey Mouse?
[13571.11s -> 13578.06s]  You guys know that that's happening, right? I wonder what they're going to do about that.
[13581.88s -> 13586.60s]  Your local car dealership is going to be able to have Mickey Mouse pop up and be like,
[13586.60s -> 13594.33s]  oh yes, I love Dave's Toyota. Or whatever it is. Can you imagine when the copyright runs out,
[13594.33s -> 13597.93s]  how many fucking commercials are going to be showing up with Mickey Mouse on them?
[13597.93s -> 13603.43s]  It'll be every commercial. Every other commercial, once that copyright runs out,
[13603.43s -> 13610.42s]  will have Mickey Mouse in it. He'll be in Olive Garden commercials, he'll be in every local,
[13610.42s -> 13615.46s]  every single local commercial you've ever seen will have him in it. It's going to be so annoying.
[13615.86s -> 13639.14s]  Mickey Mouse is going to be endorsing so many products. Think of the oversaturation though.
[13639.14s -> 13643.27s]  If you watch an Olive Garden commercial and Mickey Mouse is there and then your local
[13643.27s -> 13648.07s]  Toyota is Mickey Mouse and then a toothpaste commercial has Mickey Mouse in it,
[13648.71s -> 13667.96s]  it's going to be crazy for a while. 2024. Yeah, when is it actually supposed to happen?
[13667.96s -> 13674.54s]  They're never going to let that happen. No way. I would be really surprised if it actually did
[13674.54s -> 13694.54s]  happen. 2024. No way. Think of every virus website. That is a banner ad that will just have Mickey
[13694.54s -> 13700.62s]  Mouse doing the standing sideways with his arms up, with his hands pointing towards the banner.
[13704.57s -> 13718.78s]  People are going to click it because it's Mickey Mouse. It'll just say the magic of Mickey Mouse.
[13719.58s -> 13724.94s]  Come over to, I don't know, whatever it is, whatever virus website it is, whatever scam it is.
[13733.21s -> 13738.70s]  They've already, hold on, let me pause this. They've already bought themselves more time.
[13738.70s -> 13743.74s]  Technically it's the Steamboat Willie Mickey and they've kind of gotten that back by reverting
[13743.74s -> 13756.18s]  to an older art style for some cartoons. Oh, Mickey Mouse. You think scammers care about
[13756.18s -> 13765.43s]  copyright? Literally nobody under 40 cares about Mickey Mouse. That's not true. Mickey Mouse Club
[13765.43s -> 13769.99s]  House was one of the most popular things that anybody that was young, like nieces and nephews,
[13769.99s -> 13779.14s]  they watched the hell out of it. What are you talking about? That was a huge deal for at least
[13779.14s -> 13797.50s]  a few, a couple of years. All right, let's, I want to skip to, ooh, mother. These are good. Yeah,
[13797.50s -> 13802.76s]  of course you, everybody, Mickey Mouse is a big deal when you're a little kid. I could correct
[13802.76s -> 13812.52s]  that statement and say that anybody under 40 and over 10 maybe is correct, but I think you really
[13812.52s -> 13819.58s]  underestimate how powerful of a character Mickey Mouse is to young kids, especially like three,
[13819.58s -> 13835.86s]  two, three, four, five-year-olds. Yeah, hot dog. Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog.
[13837.56s -> 13843.80s]  Now we've got ears. Now we've got ears. Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog. Hot dog, hot dog, hot
[13843.80s -> 13863.18s]  diggity dog. What's wrong? Is it not like that? Let me put the audio back up a little bit.
[13863.18s -> 13887.67s]  It's weird to hear no sounds. There we go, that's better. Okay, so hold on a minute. Is that the
[13887.67s -> 13892.39s]  whole Disney catalog of original characters or is that Mickey Mouse? Like when is Goofy up for
[13893.03s -> 13896.95s]  auction or whatever or whatever it is? Because they have to let, is it people gonna, somebody
[13896.95s -> 13902.36s]  could buy the copyright or no, it's just public domain. Imagine they auctioned off the characters.
[13903.24s -> 13908.14s]  Holy shit. How much do you think that would go for? How many people would be in that room?
[13912.42s -> 13927.08s]  Next up is the rights to Donald Duck. That place would be full of people. Oh, I love this one.
[13927.08s -> 13932.95s]  This is the one that goes down, down, down, down, down, down. Yeah, this is the one that goes crazy.
[13932.95s -> 13946.65s]  Yep. 10 minutes, by the way. What do you mean 10 minutes? Oh, that's how long I said it was
[13946.65s -> 13959.32s]  gonna be here for when I unplugged my thing. I still haven't replaced this. It's still broken.
[13959.32s -> 13976.82s]  All right, that's good. Gosh, Mickey. Who would go for the least amount of money? Between Goofy,
[13976.82s -> 13990.55s]  Donald and, okay, Goofy, Donald, Pluto, like Daisy. Because Minnie and Minnie are,
[13991.59s -> 13996.28s]  they're billion dollar characters, right? You think Pluto would go for the least? I don't know
[13996.28s -> 14016.18s]  about that. I think Pluto is pretty iconic. Pluto or Daisy. I guess Pluto doesn't talk.
[14016.18s -> 14025.38s]  So if you wanted to sell used Toyotas with Pluto, you couldn't do that. Unless they wanted to make
[14025.38s -> 14039.38s]  them talk. What would Pluto sound like? Goofy can talk and Pluto can't. Explain that. Because,
[14039.38s -> 14071.13s]  I don't know, the four of them stepped into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Ooze, and Pluto didn't. Pluto
[14071.13s -> 14078.44s]  would sound like a gangster? Like a 30s gangster? You mean like, come on, what do you say about that?
[14078.44s -> 14085.90s]  Come on now, you say? You like that? I don't know. I don't think so. No, I don't think so.
[14093.48s -> 14103.42s]  No, no way. He'd be, because he's lovable, dopey, funny. What would Pluto talk like? Let's see.
[14104.06s -> 14113.43s]  Well, think of the other talking dog that exists, right? Other talking dog. And when I say talking
[14113.43s -> 14120.74s]  dog, I don't mean Goofy. I don't mean dog. On all fours, dogs. Scooby-Doo, right? On all fours,
[14120.74s -> 14124.74s]  they're a dog. Scooby-Doo's not supposed to be like a talking character. He's a dog on all fours.
[14128.66s -> 14137.54s]  So Pluto would have to be in that same category, right? Pluto's not going to be like Brian Griffin.
[14137.54s -> 14144.02s]  Like, oh, hey, what's going on? It's me, Pluto. Yeah, I like martinis. I did that joke like a week
[14144.02s -> 14155.77s]  ago. I don't care. But seriously, what would Pluto would probably be more dog-like? Let me think.
[14156.73s -> 14162.49s]  It would be some type of range. I don't think it would be as goofball as Scooby-Doo is.
[14165.19s -> 14177.53s]  What other dog on all fours talks? I think it's just Scooby-Doo. It's Scooby-Doo. Astro. Oh,
[14177.53s -> 14182.73s]  that's right. Yeah, Astro's in that same category where he's like, oh, I love you, roach, right?
[14184.81s -> 14187.85s]  The dogs on all fours always talk like Goofy.
[14188.49s -> 14197.45s]  Oh, doggy. I love you, roach. So if we use that same exact kind of barometer for how they're
[14197.45s -> 14207.91s]  supposed to talk, then Pluto would be in the same category. What would he do? I feel like it would
[14207.91s -> 14216.70s]  be very tongue voice. Like, the tongue is always out. Like, you know what I mean? Because he's
[14216.70s -> 14221.30s]  always... I feel like that would be a gimmick. Like, right? It would be kind of a big... His tongue's
[14221.30s -> 14238.68s]  always out. And it would probably be very playful. Like, hey, hey, hey, Nicky, are you hungry?
[14239.24s -> 14273.45s]  Maybe something like that. I can perfect it. Fuck. There's a ladder. It would be a lot of tongue.
[14274.25s -> 14286.14s]  Tongue's just always hanging out. That would be the gimmick for that dog on all fours. I don't
[14286.14s -> 14293.75s]  think Pluto makes sense. Wait, did... What's the Garfield dog? Asteroid? What's the... No, the dog
[14293.83s -> 14302.41s]  from Garfield. Did he talk? Wait, he did for one episode, didn't he? Odie, right. Didn't Odie talk
[14302.41s -> 14317.22s]  for an episode? I swear to God, there was an episode where Odie drank like a magic potion
[14317.22s -> 14339.16s]  and could talk. What am I thinking of? Spike from Tom and Jerry. Hold on, Spike from Tom and Jerry
[14339.16s -> 14360.65s]  is not on all fours. Yeah, he's bipedal. Yeah, he's not on all fours. Yeah, he literally walks
[14360.65s -> 14368.17s]  on two feet. I'm talking about on all fours, you are a dog on all fours. What about Bolt? Bolt?
[14368.89s -> 14376.65s]  Bolt the dog. Bolt the dog talks?
[14376.65s -> 14392.10s]  Oh shit, he does talk.
[14398.71s -> 14407.98s]  Fuck, this ruins everything for me. This blows up the whole theory. Bolt doesn't have like a weird
[14407.98s -> 14412.22s]  thing he does, like he doesn't go like, at the end of every sentence, does he go like, or something
[14412.22s -> 14434.47s]  weird? This is a movie, though, and it's like a celebrity was this role, right? It doesn't,
[14434.47s -> 14458.36s]  it doesn't count. Beverly Hills Chihuahua? What the fuck is this?
[14468.04s -> 14470.41s]  Can I show this on stream? I don't think I can.
[14480.26s -> 14484.82s]  No, this doesn't count either. This doesn't count. I'll tell you why this doesn't count.
[14486.20s -> 14491.59s]  Hold on. The reason why this doesn't count is because this is a real dog,
[14492.15s -> 14500.02s]  ha ha funny real dog that we CGI'd a mouth on. That's what makes this different. This is not the
[14500.02s -> 14519.00s]  same. That may, this is different because this is a CG, this is not easy to find a mate with papers.
[14521.16s -> 14522.52s]  Yeah, this doesn't count. This doesn't count.
[14538.54s -> 14544.94s]  Doesn't count because it's a, it's a, the whole gimmick of the movie is, look, it's real actors
[14544.94s -> 14551.21s]  and with its real dogs, but their mouths are CG'd. No, I'm talking about a created character
[14551.21s -> 14562.46s]  that's so, it's not a real animal. Bolt is close. Bolt, I think, ruins my theory.
[14563.02s -> 14580.60s]  101 Dalmatians. What? Fat Albert's dog talked? How many talked? No, no. Lady and the Tramp.
[14581.24s -> 14604.81s]  They talked? Wait a minute. Fuck, they did talk. Yeah, they talked a lot. But they, was it, was it
[14604.81s -> 14614.15s]  weird talking though? I can't, this is so dumb. Grammarly helps make your writing clear.
[14615.61s -> 14620.57s]  Yeah, wait till Grammarly uses Mickey Mouse. Does anybody else, okay, this, I look, I like,
[14620.57s -> 14626.33s]  Grammarly, I don't know how good the product is. I have no idea. It's probably awesome. I wonder,
[14627.14s -> 14632.90s]  right, that being said, I wonder how much money they spend on marketing because half of every ad
[14632.90s -> 14639.54s]  I've ever received for the last almost five straight years has been Grammarly. They must have
[14639.54s -> 14644.90s]  a monster marketing budget. Monster. It has to be like half the whole company's net worth.
[14646.62s -> 14658.07s]  Right? How would it be possible for them to show ads for this long? Right? All right, I did not,
[14658.07s -> 14669.38s]  what the fuck is this video that I just put in here? Am I getting a second ad? All right,
[14669.38s -> 14680.23s]  so anyways, let's see. Shit, they do talk, whatever.
[14681.19s -> 14700.07s]  Hey Joe! Did the animals talk to the people? Okay, all right, I'm not, I'm not playing anymore of
[14700.07s -> 14718.17s]  this. They talk, whatever. All dogs go to heaven. Yeah. What about non-movie? TV show. Movies is a
[14718.17s -> 14728.02s]  different story. What about TV show? Where is the cowardly dog? Yeah, but he stands up. What's,
[14728.02s -> 14738.07s]  what is Martha? Martha speaks. Martha speaks.
[14738.07s -> 14754.55s]  Shit. They all talk?
[14760.31s -> 14778.81s]  God damn it, whatever. Wilfred? Dog with a blog? What is dog with a blog? What is this nonsense?
[14780.60s -> 14798.39s]  Kids? Wait a second. I have a challenge for all of you. Okay, where is it? I need to show it. Dog
[14798.39s -> 14813.08s]  with a blog, Disney Channel. Wait, what? Dog with a blog, Disney Channel. Okay. Have a surprise for
[14813.08s -> 14820.12s]  you. All right, he's making noises. He's a rescue from the shelter. Coming soon to Disney Channel.
[14820.12s -> 14827.51s]  Thank you. I've always. There's just one little thing. Give me the stinking food. I'm drooling a
[14827.51s -> 14840.58s]  pool over here. No, but this doesn't count because he's a, he's a real dog. Wait, what do you mean
[14840.58s -> 14853.40s]  let mom and dad find out? They can't hear him? This is awesome. I want to watch this show. Why is
[14853.40s -> 14860.17s]  this reverse Santa? Disney Channel's all new comedy. Don't tell mom and dad the dog can talk. No,
[14861.13s -> 14873.94s]  dog. I don't understand. This looks bad. I want to watch it. October, this is from 10 years ago.
[14873.94s -> 14881.66s]  All right. Still, but you understand my point. Three, two dogs that have ever existed that have
[14881.66s -> 14887.50s]  ever been created as characters have a funny dog voice if they're on all fours. It's been two ever.
[14888.14s -> 14905.27s]  So, I would think Pluto would be the third. Nine years ago. That's insane. That was the turn of the
[14905.27s -> 14919.40s]  Disney Channel century, right? Where every show was just friends for kids. What about underdog?
[14919.40s -> 14926.95s]  Underdog was stood up. He stood up right and they're still doing it. I don't even know.
[14927.67s -> 14931.59s]  People always say, well, wow, the Disney Channel, like all those shows are suck and they're boring
[14931.59s -> 14935.03s]  and they're dumb and they're just soulless. Well, how can they keep making them? Somebody
[14935.03s -> 14961.70s]  has to be watching them. All right. Where's this? I had 2%. All right. Even the list. Oh, nice. It's
[14961.70s -> 14967.77s]  still there. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[14967.77s -> 14980.89s]  Go back. Go back. Get out. I need details. Okay. Gutter's the porch. All right. Gutter's in the
[14980.89s -> 14993.62s]  porch. Over here. Does cat dog count? Um, a little, but cat dog has a funny voice. A dog is like this,
[14993.62s -> 14999.94s]  Ryan. And cat is like this. It's like, oh, cat dog. No, that's, that's not like a human talking.
[14999.94s -> 15021.98s]  That's dumb. You talk like that. I don't talk like that. Crypto the super currency.
[15030.89s -> 15039.74s]  Dog from Johnny test. Did he stand upright though? I feel like that he was like a person. He stood
[15039.74s -> 15058.46s]  upright, didn't he? We have to eliminate real dogs that have a CG mouth. That doesn't count.
[15058.46s -> 15081.54s]  The only one I've really seen was that Martha one that fits that category. What about Paw Patrol?
[15081.54s -> 15086.65s]  Yeah, but they like, they drive cars and shit. Pluto doesn't drive a car. Scooby-Doo doesn't
[15086.65s -> 15111.72s]  drive a car. You have to sit upright to drive a car. They fly planes and stuff. What about the
[15111.72s -> 15120.39s]  wonder pets? Um, you're moving the goalpost. I think the things I'm saying are very, they're valid
[15120.39s -> 15138.14s]  points. You log with the blog. Look at how beautiful this house looks. What about Clifford,
[15138.14s -> 15146.04s]  the big red dog? Um, hold on to Clifford. I always thought that he had a funny voice.
[15162.62s -> 15181.77s]  Shit, they all have normal voices. I just skipped the whole episode. I just want to hear Clifford
[15181.77s -> 15204.50s]  talk. Yeah, he's normal. Damn it. What about the live action Clifford? Your whole point has been
[15204.50s -> 15211.51s]  ruined. It doesn't matter. The point still stands. Pluto would not have a normal voice. Can we? Okay,
[15212.23s -> 15216.55s]  let's do a poll. At least give me, give me the benefit of the doubt here. Let's throw a poll
[15216.55s -> 15239.18s]  up. Would Pluto have a normal voice? I don't think he would. All right, let me go back to my
[15239.18s -> 15263.61s]  soundtrack. What was it? Brawl soundtrack. Animal Crossing sounds good. Uh, the porch fences.
[15264.17s -> 15288.74s]  Porch fences and gutters. None of Mickey Mouse and friends have normal voices. I think they kind of
[15288.74s -> 15308.76s]  do. Mickey, um, Daisy? Yeah, yes they do. Yeah, they do. They have, yeah, they're normal. They're
[15308.76s -> 15316.07s]  kind of normal. Like Goofy's is just like kind of a low, a very low booming voice. Like, gosh, Mickey,
[15316.23s -> 15330.31s]  how are you, Mickey? People talk like that. That is, how is that not normal? I just did it.
[15332.04s -> 15340.04s]  Oh gosh, Mickey. Oh, hey guys, it's me, Germo. I'm here, just having a swell time on my channel.
[15340.04s -> 15350.26s]  There are people that actually talk like that. What are you talking about? Donald is the one
[15350.26s -> 15390.07s]  that's not normal. No, 82%. Thank you. Oh my God, clean it already. And then the gutter is over here.
[15390.07s -> 15405.82s]  You just spent an hour proving nothing. Well, I sure did. I just spent an hour proving I don't
[15405.82s -> 15413.54s]  know very many dogs that are on all fours to talk. That's what you should took from that.
[15417.22s -> 15421.70s]  And guess what? Neither did you until probably 10 minutes ago.
[15429.88s -> 15442.70s]  We baa, we baa, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[15442.70s -> 15464.82s]  Gutters, posts. Post, post, gutters. In here. All right, gotta get up.
[15464.82s -> 15484.58s]  We baa, we baa, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[15484.58s -> 15519.06s]  Use the ladder. I just did. Is that it? No. The gutters, something over here. Come on,
[15519.06s -> 15544.14s]  it's one little thing. Posts and window frames. What do you mean post? Posts? What window frame?
[15544.70s -> 15589.48s]  Not this, right? Window frames. Which window frame? Under the frame? Tab? Yeah, it's not showing up.
[15589.48s -> 15629.51s]  Window frame. What? Now what? Posts. Oh my God. Come on. This game sucks. No, it doesn't. How dare
[15629.51s -> 15657.16s]  you. I'm furious with that person. Furious with them. This post is fine. This one's not.
[15667.91s -> 15702.60s]  What's the problem? Beautiful. All right, I got 710 bucks. I need 1250 for that. I could get this.
[15702.60s -> 15723.80s]  I'm just gonna save the money. Now I'm gonna go finish the other one. Back to the playground.
[15723.80s -> 15745.32s]  All right, where was I? I want new music. Oh, let's go to retro. Yep.
[15750.17s -> 15769.98s]  All right, let's do the big one. I can get it with this, right? Let's do soap. Why not?
[15769.98s -> 15788.79s]  This is multi-purpose cleaner. Waste of money. It kind of is. This is not that good.
[15788.79s -> 15809.22s]  Hey, this sucks. It's not worth it. Actually not worth it. This is terrible. Here we go.
[15809.78s -> 15837.59s]  Damn it. I keep fucking it up. Can I get it all? Why does it play one second of each one of these
[15837.59s -> 15868.02s]  songs? I'm already at 30% because the songs are one second long. They are? These look much longer
[15868.02s -> 15915.61s]  than this. Go back to Animal Crossing. No, I want lips. What's the lipstick song? They have a list
[15915.61s -> 15937.29s]  here. Let's see. There we go. What's it called? No, shit. It's not here. Yeah, from Panel De Pon.
[15937.29s -> 15969.82s]  Yeah, this is the one. This one is. This one's on fire. Play Plok? What happened to this game?
[15969.82s -> 16002.42s]  Nintendo has access to so many characters and so many things that are cool. Play 100 geths.
[16006.87s -> 16029.08s]  Get off of that one. We did that already. The best part of this song is that
[16029.08s -> 16093.56s]  it's not clean. This might be like the four hour version of the song. Good. Keep it on. Oh,
[16093.56s -> 16112.12s]  come on. Why is this not clean? It looks perfect. There we go. Finally. All right. Looks good. Oh,
[16112.12s -> 16121.08s]  it's the 30 minute version. Right. I want to hear the angel. The angel island zone from Brawl.
[16122.68s -> 16151.42s]  That one was also really good. I don't even like these games. Get it up. Get it up. Get it up. Get
[16151.42s -> 16165.51s]  it up. These corners here. You can really tell the part where the drummer really picks up right
[16165.51s -> 16170.74s]  here. He starts like fucking screaming right there. In the audience, you just see the drummer just
[16170.74s -> 16176.94s]  going nuts right there. He's owning his mouth and closing it like opening him out, closing it.
[16176.94s -> 16214.66s]  This is dirty. Look at how sparkly it is over there. I love it. Play it again. Brawl had the
[16214.66s -> 16224.33s]  best soundtrack. It really did. You know, they got real comfy. They got real comfortable after Brawl.
[16224.33s -> 16231.08s]  Remember how big of a deal this was? They have all these songs from other franchises, some of
[16231.08s -> 16242.47s]  them which are not even Nintendo. It was a huge fucking deal. And I think after the Brawl
[16242.47s -> 16246.44s]  soundtrack, it was kind of just like, yeah, we're just going to put music in.
[16247.16s -> 16268.95s]  They made a really big deal about this. Why is this park covered in shit? Ultimate has a massive
[16268.95s -> 16277.72s]  OST. Yeah, but I'll be honest, I only played Ultimate for a week because I got discouraged
[16277.72s -> 16281.40s]  because of how badly I got shit on and online that I was like, I'm never playing this game ever again.
[16297.21s -> 16304.20s]  Online sucks. And it's too bad because Smash Brothers is one of the only fighting games that
[16304.20s -> 16318.12s]  I actually understand. All right, now let's do, um, you know, it's true. He's told that story more
[16318.12s -> 16329.64s]  than a few times. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Sorry. Fighting game. I have to put a quotes or an
[16329.64s -> 16335.66s]  asterisk nest to it. It's not a fighting game. It's a party game. The game where you fight
[16335.66s -> 16345.58s]  each other with essentially health bars. It's a fighting game. Mario versus Luigi. They beat the
[16345.58s -> 16352.87s]  shit out of each other and one of them loses the fight. That's a fighting game. Now, it might not
[16352.87s -> 16358.15s]  be a very in-depth fighting game if you really want to call it that. It's not a fighting game.
[16358.15s -> 16363.85s]  It is. They're fighting each other. The characters are fighting on screen. It's a, you could call it
[16363.85s -> 16369.64s]  a party game too, but it's also a fighting game. You pick a character and one of us wins and one
[16369.64s -> 16383.88s]  of us loses. Cod is a fighting game. Dynasty Warriors is a fighting game. It's not a fighting
[16383.88s -> 16399.03s]  game. Well, what makes a fighting game a fighting game then? What makes a fighting game? No, it's
[16399.03s -> 16413.02s]  not. You could say Madden is a fighting game, couldn't you? 2D melee combat. Well, the Hadouken
[16413.02s -> 16430.84s]  is not melee. It has to have frame data and special moves. Chips are dinner. What are you talking
[16430.84s -> 16438.20s]  about? Why'd you say that? Chips are dinner? They could be. They can be if you eat chips for dinner.
[16438.20s -> 16446.63s]  Who said that? That's funny. Is that Joel? Ah, it's fucking, what a hilarious joke.
[16448.52s -> 16453.96s]  You can eat chips for dinner. It sucks. It's bad for you. You can also, you could eat hamburger
[16453.96s -> 16471.30s]  meat for dinner. Literally Smash is a fighting game. What am I gonna put on for music? Smash is
[16471.30s -> 16486.10s]  a kid's game. Okay, is it a kid's fighting game? A party game to me is like, oh, let's put on,
[16486.10s -> 16492.66s]  let's put on, let's put the Tekken soundtrack on. I don't know. You call it whatever you want,
[16492.66s -> 16498.55s]  but I remember playing like Tekken and playing like Virtua Fighter and shit. And those games,
[16498.63s -> 16503.03s]  I remember just playing it with friends and you'd get punched like three times and you'd go,
[16503.99s -> 16507.75s]  KO knockout. You just like fell off the fucking level. It was, it wasn't fun.
[16507.75s -> 16514.22s]  I remember getting caught in like a Tekken combo and I just didn't even get to play the game.
[16514.22s -> 16523.99s]  Like I felt like it wasn't pressing the buttons hard enough in some of those games.
[16528.25s -> 16541.34s]  Tekken also isn't 2D. That's right. Let's play, let's put on Tekken OST. I remember just getting,
[16541.34s -> 16545.74s]  walking outside of bounds accidentally in Virtua Fighter and never playing it again.
[16546.38s -> 16561.74s]  Just smash like a competitive fighting game. I mean, a lot of people would tell you that,
[16561.74s -> 16568.17s]  that Melee is. What separates Melee from any other fighting game? If you, okay, if you do
[16568.17s -> 16587.35s]  no items, no bullshit, just fighting each other, how is it different? Not this debate. Okay. Like
[16587.35s -> 16591.51s]  Brawl would, I would classify maybe not as a fighting game because you can just trip for no
[16591.51s -> 16603.54s]  reason. It's just, and that's, maybe that's not a fighting game. I don't know. Like imagine if
[16603.54s -> 16607.30s]  Street Fighter, if all of a sudden your character fell down like 1% of the time,
[16608.10s -> 16613.32s]  it would suck for a lot of these competitive players.
[16614.20s -> 16624.10s]  Sakurai himself said there's not, Smash is not a fighting game. So there's no debate.
[16624.82s -> 16659.45s]  I mean, but it's, it's not, but we're just playing semantics though. Oh, look at how dirty this
[16659.45s -> 16668.57s]  edge is. It's an action game. It's an action party game that includes fighting people on a stage to
[16668.57s -> 16691.91s]  reduce their health to zero and reduce their lives to zero. All right. Reduce 100%.
[16692.79s -> 16698.60s]  That's a fighting game. Yeah. I mean, I would say that's a fighting game,
[16698.60s -> 16704.02s]  but then like somebody said, what is, is CoD a fighting game? It's you and me versus each other
[16704.02s -> 16708.10s]  on like a battlefield. And I'm trying to reduce your health to zero while we fight each other
[16708.10s -> 16715.22s]  and shoot each other. Why do we have to have all these rules? Why can't we just whatever?
[16725.53s -> 16747.22s]  Guns make it a shooter. Well, striker is in mortal combat. He has a gun. Joker has a gun.
[16753.86s -> 16759.78s]  Isn't there a character in Tekken that's literally, it's like a kangaroo with boxing gloves on.
[16761.91s -> 16769.50s]  That's pretty much a Smash character. I don't think it matters what the weapon you're using
[16769.50s -> 16776.52s]  is. I really don't think so. It's a bear. Who's the kangaroo? Roger. Yeah. It is a raptor as well.
[16776.52s -> 16814.42s]  What game is that? Tekken 3 is a kangaroo and two bears. There's no role playing in most RPGs.
[16815.14s -> 16836.71s]  That's right. Yeah. So who cares? Like, what does it matter? Smash character is an anime
[16836.71s -> 16853.66s]  protagonist with a sword. Well, I mean, I will say that makes up a lot of them. Makes up a lot
[16853.66s -> 16869.72s]  of the characters, but here's the, here's the one thing I will say about Smash to kind of rebut.
[16869.72s -> 16875.54s]  Look, I don't like that there's anime character with sword for 10 characters either. Here's where
[16875.54s -> 16878.98s]  I rebuttal that. It's the only way I can rebuttal this. It's the only way that makes sense to me.
[16879.78s -> 16886.92s]  There's like 85 Smash characters. Isn't there like a hundred playable characters in the Switch one?
[16888.17s -> 16899.16s]  That's so many characters. I guess at some point you're going to make a few more protagonists with
[16899.16s -> 16909.03s]  sword. There's 80 in the Switch one. That's so many. How many characters are in Tekken? 12? 15?
[16919.69s -> 16935.32s]  50? What? There are not 50 characters in Tekken. No way. How many characters are in Tekken 4?
[16936.98s -> 16945.72s]  23 characters in Tekken 4. All right. Tekken 5. 32 in Tekken 5. Tekken 6. 39 in Tekken 6. Tekken 7.
[16947.18s -> 16959.22s]  36 in Tekken 7. Tekken 8. 51 characters. Wait, this is not out yet. Okay. So Tekken 8 is not
[16959.22s -> 16970.49s]  out yet. But even still, in the Tekken that's not out yet, 51 characters are planned for Tekken 8.
[16970.49s -> 16976.63s]  There are 80 in Smash Brothers. So how many characters are there in Street Fighter? Street
[16976.63s -> 16982.39s]  Fighter... I don't even know anything about Street Fighter. They release the same Street Fighter like
[16982.39s -> 16987.51s]  Skyrim style five times every year or two. Street Fighter 5 has come out like four times. How many
[16987.51s -> 16992.66s]  Street Fighters have there been? Street Fighter 6? How many characters are Street Fighter 6?
[16993.30s -> 17004.66s]  Eight? There are only eight characters in Street Fighter 6? How many characters in Street Fighter
[17004.66s -> 17020.10s]  5? 16. It's not out yet. Oh. We gotta stop numbering shit. I'm serious. Stop numbering
[17020.10s -> 17027.88s]  video games. Especially ones that are in a series like this. Like we're gonna get to eventually like
[17027.88s -> 17036.38s]  Tekken 17? Why? Call it like Tekken? The Battle for Azeroth or whatever the hell you want to call it.
[17036.38s -> 17041.42s]  After five, it's like all right. Do we really need to... How many are you gonna number? Like 10,
[17041.42s -> 17051.06s]  12, 15, 20? I made this joke on Twitter and I'm gonna make it on here now too because it's been
[17051.06s -> 17058.30s]  like six and a half years. When you get to the point where your numbered franchise has as many
[17058.30s -> 17077.85s]  numbers as the Jason movies, it's time to figure out another title. Think about this. In 20 more
[17077.85s -> 17087.03s]  years, trying to remember when Street Fighter 7 or 8 came out is gonna be like impossible.
[17088.02s -> 17094.98s]  Street Fighter 4 was... Wait. When the fuck was that? Street Fighter 2? Street Fighter 16? I don't
[17094.98s -> 17107.54s]  remember. When did that character come out? Street Fighter 70? I don't know. Or if you want to number
[17107.54s -> 17115.29s]  them, just do it like they... Yeah. Give it the year. Like Street Fighter 95. Street Fighter 2006.
[17115.29s -> 17121.58s]  So then I can at least know when the hell it was. Street Fighter 2020. Like I have... I know
[17121.58s -> 17134.06s]  when that was. Sonic 06. Yeah. I know exactly when that came out. In the barrage of Sonic the Hedgehog
[17134.06s -> 17140.86s]  video games, I know exactly what that game was. I know the precise opening cutscene. I know all the
[17140.86s -> 17166.06s]  characters in it. I know the exact game. Sonic 06 came out in 2005. Whatever. It's still that same
[17166.06s -> 17175.35s]  period. It's fine. What's the name of the princess in Sonic 06? Oh! I don't know anything! Eliza!
[17176.15s -> 17185.00s]  Ely... Elisa! One of those. I know it's one. It's close. Elise. Oh! Oh! What? I don't know?
[17185.00s -> 17201.62s]  I was very close. Eliza. I don't know. It was one of that. Why did I know that? Because Sonic 06,
[17201.62s -> 17205.54s]  I remember the whole game because it was 06 and I know the exact year. I know the exact place I
[17205.54s -> 17224.52s]  was sitting. Calm down. I'm calm! I remember... I have a very, very distinct memory of Sonic 06.
[17224.52s -> 17230.42s]  You know why? Because I thought that game was weird as shit. Isn't that the game where there's
[17230.42s -> 17236.65s]  like real people and you're in like a real like human city and shit and there's like real people?
[17237.45s -> 17252.57s]  It was really weird to me. It wasn't the typical, oh, you got the cat. You've got
[17253.77s -> 17261.74s]  you got the slug guy. You've got the bat person. You've got the Amy, right? It was... They were
[17261.74s -> 17281.37s]  humans in cutscenes interacting with Sonic. It was kind of strange. Mario Odyssey did that.
[17285.45s -> 17291.37s]  In Sonic 06, the characters were very like life-like human characters. Like CG human
[17291.37s -> 17304.23s]  characters. Very high detailed humans. They were not in Odyssey. They were like very high detailed
[17304.23s -> 17314.42s]  human characters in Odyssey. They were human characters in Odyssey, but they weren't like
[17314.42s -> 17320.66s]  super high quality, high detailed facial structures and stuff, were they? I don't remember that.
[17320.66s -> 17339.18s]  They were like cartoon, right? Sonic 06 had cartoon style of Sonic and then these highly
[17339.18s -> 17367.14s]  detailed human real people. This is almost done. Sonic 06 was not originally a Sonic game. Is that
[17367.14s -> 17385.10s]  why? What was it supposed to be? Who said that? Somebody did. It was supposed to be a Final Fantasy
[17385.10s -> 17397.30s]  game, was it? It was called Humans 06. Oh, that's great. Give that person a badge or something.
[17397.30s -> 17418.20s]  I need music. How about... How about... Cupcakes! How about... Cupcakes! Um, how about...
[17426.01s -> 17433.99s]  Mega Man? That sounds good. Mega Man... See, this is another problem. I know there's a few songs in
[17433.99s -> 17440.79s]  Mega Man that I would like. I don't know if it's Mega Man 3 or Mega Man 10. I'm gonna go with Mega
[17440.79s -> 17477.45s]  Man 3. Mega Man 06. This thing is dirty. Oh, it's definitely Mega Man 3. Let's pick the right one.
[17496.25s -> 17513.85s]  Under the chin. Stuck in here. I want to throw like a water grenade right here. What do you mean?
[17514.49s -> 17533.83s]  Like a clean grenade. It looks pretty good. Water balloon. Yeah, but a big one. Water bazooka? Yep.
[17534.39s -> 17544.57s]  I just said that to you like I was being asked by my mother if I was ready for school
[17544.57s -> 17559.98s]  when I was still sleeping. Yep. Honey, are you already ready? Yep. Yep. That was my favorite
[17559.98s -> 17568.44s]  thing. I always said, I'm just putting my socks on. That was the way to get away from it. Yeah,
[17568.44s -> 17574.18s]  I'm just putting my socks on with my eyes closed. I'm still in bed. I don't know why that worked.
[17574.74s -> 17586.01s]  I guess because putting socks on kind of is a pain in the ass sometimes maybe.
[17586.81s -> 17594.17s]  Like that takes a while for some reason in my child brain. And then if you hear your mother
[17594.17s -> 17598.65s]  start to come towards the room. You hear like the here comes mom. She's walking towards the door.
[17599.37s -> 17605.13s]  You rip out of the bed as fast as you fucking can. You feel horrible. You feel like shit.
[17605.13s -> 17608.57s]  But you immediately grab the fucking pair of socks and like you're struggling to put it on
[17608.57s -> 17614.71s]  your foot. And she comes in. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm just, I'm just socks on. Like you're
[17614.71s -> 17621.69s]  just so fucked up. And then you hear the door close. You look over and you just lie right back
[17621.69s -> 17627.38s]  down. And then you do it all over again. And then your mother thinks that there's like something
[17627.38s -> 17634.20s]  wrong with you because I was just in here 10 minutes ago and you're still having trouble
[17634.20s -> 17643.93s]  putting your socks on. What are you doing? Are you all right? You're putting the sock on the same
[17643.93s -> 17664.20s]  foot when I came in here 10 minutes ago. There was one time when I didn't want to go to school.
[17664.20s -> 17669.18s]  I was like, I don't want to go to school today. Fuck that. I'm staying home. Like, oh, I don't
[17669.18s -> 17677.93s]  feel good. Oh, my stomach hurts. Oh, okay. Yeah. Take your temperature. And I took the thermometer
[17677.93s -> 17684.09s]  and I held it up. I held it up to a light bulb when she left the room. Like a hot light bulb.
[17684.09s -> 17687.53s]  I held it up right to the light bulb. And then I, when I heard her coming back in,
[17687.53s -> 17690.97s]  she was coming back in the room and I put it under my tongue. I put it like in my mouth.
[17691.85s -> 17700.30s]  And she grabbed it. And it was like 110. Something fucking crazy. And she's like,
[17700.30s -> 17715.13s]  uh, what is going on? I don't feel good. And it was just like, go to school. Get up. No,
[17715.13s -> 17718.89s]  but I don't feel good. I think I have a temperature. Okay, because if you had 108
[17718.89s -> 17722.73s]  temperatures, you'd be dead. Um, you're still alive. So I don't know what you did here,
[17722.73s -> 17730.12s]  but get up and go to fucking school. I'd be like, oh, whatever. I would just get up and get ready.
[17731.86s -> 17739.30s]  Stole that from ET. I probably did. Probably watched it and thought it would work.
[17740.65s -> 17744.97s]  I used to do that shit. I put orange juice in my, I'm not, I'm not making this up. This is a
[17744.97s -> 17753.21s]  fucking real story. I put orange juice in my mouth one time and went to, so my grandmother was around.
[17753.21s -> 17758.94s]  My grandmother was watching us at the time. And I put orange juice in my mouth and like went on the
[17758.94s -> 17768.28s]  ground going like, Oh no, like I'm going to puke. And I went like, and I spit like three tablespoons
[17768.28s -> 17781.61s]  of orange juice onto the ground. It was like, what are you doing? I was like, I'm sexy. You were a
[17781.61s -> 17791.58s]  little shit. No, I just, no, I wasn't. It was a tile floor. So it was easy to clean. I was like 10
[17792.38s -> 17804.42s]  and it was, it was very clearly. I put orange juice in my mouth and I was like, I'm, look at me.
[17804.42s -> 17811.70s]  I'm sick. I'm puking on the ground and it never worked. I always thought somehow it was going to
[17811.70s -> 17817.53s]  work one day and it never did. It's really funny because if I, if I had just, and I used to do this
[17817.53s -> 17822.73s]  sometimes, if I was like, like, nah, I'm not really feeling that great. I'm really kind of,
[17822.73s -> 17827.53s]  I think I need to take like a day. I'm like, I don't feel great. It was like, okay, yeah, sure.
[17828.41s -> 17830.41s]  But it was the times that I was like, oh, I'm sick.
[17833.05s -> 17837.77s]  And I would always put on a voice. You guys ever do that? You ever put on the, I'm sick voice?
[17837.77s -> 17844.66s]  Here's the, I'm sick voice. Mom, I don't feel good. Yeah. I don't know if something's wrong.
[17844.66s -> 17849.30s]  I think I like, I have a headache and everything. What, what does that, what does that mean?
[17849.30s -> 17860.30s]  Doesn't mean anything. Oh, I feel good because my head is hurting. Nobody talks like that. Even
[17860.30s -> 17867.86s]  when you're sick, what are you doing? If, if I had just been honest with my mother, it wouldn't be
[17867.86s -> 17871.54s]  like, all right, go to school. It'd be like, oh, all right. You don't, that's fine. Yeah. Take a day.
[17884.34s -> 17888.74s]  It was not hard. It would just be like, I don't really feel like going to school today. I like,
[17888.74s -> 17893.45s]  don't feel like it. It's like, all right. Is everything all right? Like, yeah, I just,
[17893.45s -> 17901.18s]  I don't know. I just don't want to. I'm telling you right now, it was a fucking miracle that I
[17901.18s -> 17908.22s]  like passed any school besides college. I actually, I tried. I really did try in college. I did.
[17908.86s -> 17914.60s]  I want, I wanted to like do well and I want to do like college stuff. And I, I really did try.
[17915.40s -> 17922.20s]  But man, in high school and in middle school, I think, I honestly think I did one homework
[17922.20s -> 17929.06s]  worksheet in four years. I seriously think that I truly believe that. And I would just do well on
[17929.06s -> 17936.23s]  the tests. Like I would just get like an 80 or 85 on the tests. I just wouldn't ever do homework,
[17936.23s -> 17958.50s]  ever. 2.6 Andy. 2.8, 2.6. Same. I hated homework. Homework is such a scam. It really is.
[17959.22s -> 17968.15s]  Nobody wants to do that shit at their house. I don't think it does anything for kids. I really
[17968.15s -> 17971.83s]  don't think it helps retain information. I really don't think so. I actually don't believe that.
[17974.10s -> 17979.70s]  I think homework makes a little bit of sense. It's almost like the teachers are trying just to get
[17979.70s -> 17985.37s]  you to continue to pay attention or something. But it's like, like, no, no, no, you have to go
[17985.37s -> 17989.45s]  back into your house and do this too. Cause I want to make sure you fucking paid attention today.
[17989.45s -> 17997.21s]  Well, make your class not suck. How does that sound? And then you have the other problem is
[17997.21s -> 18003.19s]  teachers are so underpaid, at least in America, we should be, we should be paying teachers a shit
[18003.19s -> 18015.94s]  load of money. And I mean it in an absolute metric fuck ton of money. Schools should only be four
[18015.94s -> 18021.56s]  days a week and it shouldn't be six hours. It should be like fucking four. Pay teachers a shit
[18021.56s -> 18027.27s]  load of money and it'll be like classes will be better. They'll be more interesting, have interesting
[18027.27s -> 18034.92s]  classes. You know what I mean? Why is it so hard to figure out? This actually is not even that hard
[18034.92s -> 18043.74s]  of a thing to figure out. This is not even difficult. This is like common sense. I was so
[18043.74s -> 18049.43s]  unproductive when I was a kid because I waking up at six o'clock in the morning and going to school
[18049.43s -> 18056.25s]  for six hours, I just, it sucked. I just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. Now imagine
[18056.33s -> 18062.01s]  if school didn't start till fucking 10 or 9 and the classes were interesting, the teachers really
[18062.01s -> 18065.05s]  gave a shit, really, really did. And there are teachers that do give a shit. They do, a lot of
[18065.05s -> 18072.14s]  them. Pay the teachers more money. I would get the 30 fucking thousand dollars a year for a teacher,
[18072.14s -> 18078.89s]  40,000. Double that overnight, immediately. Holy shit, we're talking about our kids' brains for
[18078.89s -> 18102.18s]  God's sake. So much more productivity comes in place when people like want to do it and they're
[18102.18s -> 18105.94s]  prepared to do it and it's not, they're not being forced to do it. I think that's the biggest problem.
[18105.94s -> 18114.74s]  I really do. When I was in school, I felt like I was forced to do it. And there were some classes,
[18114.74s -> 18117.38s]  there were some times where I felt like, oh, actually, you know what, like doing this math
[18117.38s -> 18123.16s]  problem, I actually kind of liked this. It wasn't every day at all. Because maybe like a few times,
[18123.16s -> 18126.36s]  maybe like a few times a week was I really like in the head space of like, you know what, I guess
[18126.36s -> 18138.50s]  I can do like a bunch of long division or something. Fine. You can jump in the game. Yeah, take a look.
[18153.85s -> 18158.01s]  And it's like, even for the kids that really excel, I'm sure some of you, I'm sure probably
[18158.01s -> 18164.26s]  really excel in school. I'm sure you do. But how much more, how much better would you be doing
[18165.24s -> 18172.71s]  if you had the more tools to do better? If the classes were even more interesting, right? If
[18172.71s -> 18179.27s]  like your teachers didn't have to fucking fight the budget board to like get pens and shit and
[18179.27s -> 18182.87s]  like pencils, you know what I mean? Like there's so much things that teachers would like to do.
[18185.10s -> 18200.30s]  We're having a money. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. I would probably still hate
[18200.30s -> 18205.43s]  school. Look, school is school, right? You got, you do it. You got to learn stuff. And there's
[18205.43s -> 18210.23s]  another thing. What in the name of God, and I'm going to go off on this, right? This is time to
[18210.23s -> 18216.66s]  do it during the Mega Man song, right? I don't care. I'm just going off. I'm doing it. Why do
[18216.66s -> 18224.60s]  we not teach everybody, put a huge emphasis on like finances and, and how to like file a
[18224.60s -> 18230.76s]  fucking tax return and stuff. We spend like an hour on that shit. Sometimes like maybe one week
[18231.40s -> 18238.65s]  of like your, your home ec class is about some of this stuff. Teach kids what like a credit
[18238.65s -> 18244.63s]  score is, what like a credit card does. Financial like literacy, like we need to teach this shit to
[18244.63s -> 18251.00s]  people. Like we don't even, it's just, oh, well maybe one day they'll figure it out. What the
[18251.00s -> 18257.50s]  hell is school for? If not to prepare everybody for adulthood, right? It's to prepare us for the
[18257.50s -> 18268.04s]  fucking world. I'll be honest. I don't really care about like doing math problems or what
[18268.92s -> 18275.64s]  like Genghis Khan did. We have Netflix documentaries that can cover that shit in an hour.
[18276.28s -> 18289.32s]  And I'm not saying that stuff's not important. It is. It is. We need to obviously learn about
[18289.32s -> 18292.92s]  who we are and where, what people are, where they're from, what people have done,
[18294.04s -> 18297.80s]  what the world was like, what are the things that happened, major important, of course.
[18298.76s -> 18303.58s]  But to replace, to replace like actual life skills and teaching people things that they're
[18303.58s -> 18310.04s]  going to need. I think the focus is on preparing people for adulthood because when you're not
[18310.04s -> 18326.94s]  prepared for adulthood, then you get stuck. Are you running for office? Yes. No, I'm not.
[18328.33s -> 18334.10s]  This is not even some like, oh wow, he was so brave. No, I don't think that. I just,
[18334.10s -> 18339.86s]  I honestly just think. You guys know how much, you want to get like angry for a second?
[18340.50s -> 18346.74s]  Look at, at least in the United States, go look at the breakdown of where our federal tax dollars
[18346.74s -> 18351.86s]  go. Just go do it. It takes two seconds. Go look at where education is, how much we spend federally
[18351.86s -> 18370.81s]  on education. Huh? What? They need to increase that by a huge amount. This is not, it's not
[18370.81s -> 18376.09s]  political. This is not political. This is just like, well, well, well, well, it is political,
[18376.09s -> 18381.61s]  whatever. I'm breaking my own rules. I know. No, it's not political. It's not political.
[18382.33s -> 18387.05s]  I'm just telling you to go look. We don't spend very much on education at all.
[18387.05s -> 18400.81s]  And it's incredibly important. It's not politics. It's just, this is just whatever. It's not a lot.
[18400.81s -> 18411.43s]  And like, why is it not a lot? We don't, we, education is so important. Science, medicine,
[18411.43s -> 18417.74s]  technology, right? Like these are things we need to do. Just go look at the budget one day. Just go
[18417.74s -> 18422.06s]  look at it and be like, Oh, I wonder where our money goes. And just look at it. Just stare at it
[18422.06s -> 18448.14s]  for a half a minute. This is based. No, it's not. It's not. It really isn't. This is very based. I
[18448.14s -> 18454.41s]  mean, I just think it's, I think a lot of issues could be solved in our country, in our world,
[18454.41s -> 18468.78s]  in our country. Let me, let me put like fake fucking crowd music. I think that a lot of issues
[18468.78s -> 18478.49s]  in our country can be completely solved by having a much better education system, teaching kids
[18478.49s -> 18482.97s]  what they need to learn to be an adult. Fine. I'm talking about financial literacy. I'm talking about
[18484.81s -> 18489.77s]  skills that they'll need to learn to be a functioning adult. I'm talking about being
[18489.77s -> 18494.65s]  able to teach kids, not just about like history and science and social studies. I'm talking
[18494.65s -> 18501.05s]  about life skills, things you need. It shouldn't be 2% of the budget. It should be probably 10.
[18506.78s -> 18511.10s]  If that's political, I'm sorry, then this is a political stream at the moment or this moment.
[18511.10s -> 18517.43s]  I don't think it is. More money to teachers, more money to programs. Like you take a look at,
[18519.03s -> 18522.31s]  you take a look at what are like our programs that are suffering right now.
[18522.31s -> 18528.55s]  Extracurricular shit to like, like our arts and the arts programs are all just suffering.
[18528.55s -> 18536.36s]  You know what I mean? Like what the hell's going on? Oh, I'm looking at my phone.
[18542.18s -> 18553.64s]  Hold your applause for a second. I had to look at my phone. He's getting texted. No, but seriously,
[18554.81s -> 18561.74s]  programs like, okay, when we did the archeology thing, like the science center, they do virtual
[18561.74s -> 18565.66s]  field trips and shit. Imagine how awesome that would be if that was just no, like just a part
[18565.66s -> 18571.96s]  of everybody's lives as a kid. More field trips, do more cool shit. I don't want to go to the same
[18571.96s -> 18580.15s]  place for a field trip. I don't want a field trip to just be, we go into a bus and go to Dairy Queen.
[18582.10s -> 18593.34s]  That's not a field trip. You know how many times I've seen the people, the old time people churn
[18593.34s -> 18601.00s]  the butter when I was younger? Oh, this is what it was like back in the old times. I've been to that
[18601.00s -> 18635.08s]  place like 10 times and go Red Sox. Oh, this feels good. I like this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
[18638.33s -> 18644.84s]  But seriously, if you go look at where our money goes, I think we could really stand to put a
[18644.84s -> 18652.76s]  little more of our, we could restructure our budget a little bit, have people going to school and
[18652.76s -> 18657.24s]  shit be really important. I guess it is important and not just not shitty school, not dumb school,
[18657.24s -> 18665.46s]  not school that everybody hates going to. I don't want to dump a shitload more money into
[18666.02s -> 18669.94s]  a boring shitty education system. I'm talking about, let's redo the whole goddamn thing.
[18670.66s -> 18674.36s]  Make it good. Make it fun. Make it interesting. Make it engaging. You know what I mean? Then you'd
[18674.36s -> 18690.60s]  want to do it. You'd want to go and fuck Capcom by the way. Yeah. You say that at like the political,
[18691.24s -> 18700.44s]  at like the big speech and like my campaign rally and fuck Capcom. What's with the FOV?
[18700.44s -> 18708.89s]  They need to change that. And honestly, I don't think it even matters like where you even stand
[18708.89s -> 18714.79s]  politically. I think that everybody could probably agree that we got to, we got to make our shit a
[18714.79s -> 18717.83s]  little better. You know what I mean? We've got to like put another, a higher standard here. We've
[18717.83s -> 18724.44s]  got to make a little bit more. I don't think that's like a necessarily biased statement to
[18724.44s -> 18750.98s]  any political leaning. I really don't think it is. No, you don't know what I am. You don't
[18750.98s -> 18754.98s]  know how I lean politically. I've never talked about it. You have no idea. You have absolutely
[18754.98s -> 18763.42s]  no idea. You guess. I'm going to keep you guessing. But that's not what this stream is for. And we
[18763.42s -> 18769.10s]  talked about that before as well. But sometimes, you know, you got to talk about some things.
[18769.10s -> 18773.34s]  I had to. I had to. I've got something on my mind recently. It has. You literally told us. No,
[18773.34s -> 18778.62s]  I didn't. I thought you were centrist. No, when did I say that? I said that? When did I say that?
[18779.18s -> 18791.99s]  When did I say that? Did I get shitfaced one day and say that? Was I like drunk on wine and I was
[18791.99s -> 18804.18s]  like, I'm a centrist. When did that happen? I don't think that happened. That didn't happen.
[18804.18s -> 18809.54s]  You didn't have to say that. What are you talking about? I've never, it's a fucking secret
[18810.26s -> 18817.10s]  of what, how, what I believe. All right. And no, don't let anybody ever tell you differently.
[18817.10s -> 18836.09s]  It's obvious. What's obvious? What do you mean it's obvious? Why are you panicking? I'm not
[18836.09s -> 18858.01s]  panicking. Whatever. It's in your rant section on YouTube, is it? You support Verbin Supreme.
[18859.90s -> 18877.27s]  I mean, that guy's fucking hilarious, but I don't know what his policies are. I'm already at 60%
[18877.27s -> 18900.06s]  here. Just admit it. You watched Bionicle with Biden. It's obvious. We know. You don't know
[18900.06s -> 18911.90s]  anything. Nobody knows anything. Let me just pretend that people don't know. An anarchist?
[18911.90s -> 18935.72s]  I'm not an anarchist. What are you talking about? You're a Minecraft anarchist. I don't even know
[18935.72s -> 18959.54s]  what that is. I have no idea what I just said. The ultimate secret of German 985s political leanings.
[18959.54s -> 18982.28s]  All right. This is good. I want more soap. Soap is pretty good here. Soap is actually good here.
[18982.28s -> 18996.26s]  I gotta get in there. How do I get up there? Do I have to go across the bars? He's a biblio
[18996.90s -> 19019.37s]  gugu gaga ding dongist. What is that? Sure, I guess. Stop playing this? I'm having fun. I like this.
[19029.45s -> 19057.85s]  There we go. Get in there. That's my dirt KD. Pretty high. Show us what you look like without
[19057.85s -> 19062.76s]  your dentures in. Why would I do that? I don't like the way I look without my dentures in. Why
[19062.76s -> 19111.91s]  would I do that? Stop hot boxing the playground. This is open air in here. Geriatric Andy. I'm not
[19111.91s -> 19123.50s]  geriatric. I am getting older though. You do have that right. It's okay to get older. I don't feel a
[19123.50s -> 19130.71s]  day over 30. I definitely feel 30 though. In fact, probably a little bit older. I don't feel a day
[19130.71s -> 19158.55s]  over 32. You know what I mean? I missed it. You said something but I missed it. 62%. Let's go.
[19159.19s -> 19178.07s]  How is it like living past 30? I like it. I like it. I like being 30 plus. Slow down a little bit.
[19178.71s -> 19192.39s]  Takes me a little longer. I just like kind of chill. Oh, I know. I get that.
[19199.40s -> 19203.08s]  You get angry when young people are loud. I get angry when anybody gets loud.
[19215.37s -> 19230.68s]  I like that. Trinket. From a chill, you're not 60. Yeah, I can guarantee you that I've lost a
[19230.68s -> 19237.13s]  step or two though. I mean, look, I already have like a medical problem, right? I didn't have that
[19237.13s -> 19242.46s]  in my 20s. That started in my 30s. Already, I can tell you, I've slowed down quite a bit.
[19254.17s -> 19273.58s]  Is there a ladder here? Because this is annoying. All right, this is done. I'm 20 and I have a
[19273.58s -> 19284.54s]  bunch of medical problems. It's really a dice roll. Yeah, I know. That's true. I'm sorry to hear that
[19284.54s -> 19355.35s]  though. Get some music? All right, yeah. Do it. What the fuck? He didn't even do it.
[19355.35s -> 19393.10s]  Do it. Why won't he do it? Why was this file? The person played in the wrong file or something.
[19414.66s -> 19438.92s]  Fucking do it. Thank you. It's not the mandala effect. It's right there. I need an actual
[19439.00s -> 19484.81s]  OST though. How about Donut Country? Oh, this is nice. Sure. I have a homework assignment for you
[19484.81s -> 19489.58s]  guys. I know homework. You don't want to do homework. I know we just talked about it, but that
[19492.79s -> 19499.10s]  it's in something else and I don't know what it's in. It's been bugging me for like 25 fucking years.
[19500.65s -> 19509.46s]  It's in something else. It happens in either another game or a TV show or it's been bugging
[19509.46s -> 19528.04s]  me for like 20 years. When's the homework due? Next week. Oh, this is oh my god. This one's
[19528.04s -> 19551.54s]  horrible. I'm buying the soap. Let's go. It works so much better. I can do the rest of the cleanup
[19551.54s -> 19565.37s]  later with the save for the new gun. Okay, that's good. Now go like this. This nozzle is terrible.
[19566.01s -> 19575.48s]  The only thing that takes any dirt up anymore is the green and the yellow and barely the green.
[19576.04s -> 19598.94s]  I need that new gun right now. Was it 1200? I don't know this song. Just skipping. Like it was a CD.
[19599.66s -> 19643.21s]  Why is it doing that? 1080 nozzle. I got a 3090 now, man. Nice flex. No, see what happened was
[19643.21s -> 19651.40s]  I was forced to buy one because graphics cards didn't exist and me and Community Jake were both
[19651.40s -> 19658.44s]  desperately in all these different places trying to find a graphics card because remember eight
[19658.44s -> 19665.53s]  months ago when I wanted to build a new computer? So I didn't want a 3090, but I got a 3090 because
[19665.53s -> 19683.45s]  that was all that was available and I'll tell you this thing is hot. This thing runs way hotter
[19683.45s -> 19694.50s]  than my 1080. So now I get computer room syndrome which means it just gets so hot in here because I
[19694.50s -> 19706.78s]  have this monster 3090 in here generating furnace level of heat. What's the average temp on it?
[19707.80s -> 19714.17s]  It's really high. I'm gonna have to do something about it. It's way too high. I think it hits like
[19714.17s -> 19730.12s]  90 Celsius 95 92 all the time. I think it peaks at like 100. Underclock it. It's not overclocked.
[19730.12s -> 19737.06s]  It's just regular clock speed. Yeah, these things just run insanely hot. I looked it up.
[19737.06s -> 19750.06s]  I might have to get a cooler for this thing in particular. Underclock it. Why would I want to do
[19750.06s -> 19763.64s]  that? Memory runs warm probably referring to that. Micron posted actual specs recently. Max 105
[19763.64s -> 19771.53s]  Celsius under load. That seems so hot. That seems like it shouldn't be like that. That's more than
[19771.53s -> 19794.30s]  boiling water, isn't it? That's like 200 something degrees. Get a water cooler. Yeah, I'm gonna have
[19794.30s -> 19800.12s]  to do something. I really don't want one of those big elaborate tube systems though. I can just get
[19800.12s -> 19817.75s]  a GPU cooler and replace the stock fans on it, right? That'll probably be fine. Get an AIO. AIO, okay.
[19818.47s -> 19850.65s]  What's an AIO? This whole thing under here. PC will cool it, but your room might be just as hot.
[19850.65s -> 19861.51s]  Yeah, they make it make AC units for the back of a computer. I think they do. They're probably so
[19861.51s -> 19883.40s]  stupid expensive though. All the geek squad. Stick it in the fridge. Just get a mini fridge,
[19883.40s -> 19889.45s]  put the computer in the mini fridge, and have the power cord be coming out of like a hole I drilled.
[19891.54s -> 19906.95s]  Would that work? What would that do? That would work, right? There's a Linus Tech Tips video on
[19906.95s -> 19934.36s]  that. That's funny. I'll have to watch that later. 73%. All right, get in there. Can you power wash
[19934.36s -> 19941.16s]  your balls? Well, if you did that, I don't... I think you'd be at the hospital. That would be a
[19941.16s -> 19950.42s]  bad idea. I think that would be a major, major mistake. I would not ever ever do something like
[19950.42s -> 19994.76s]  that. Sounds very dangerous and very stupid. God. 74. This one should be way more than 400 bucks.
[19994.76s -> 20016.46s]  It should be way more. This is so much more time. This is so much more work. GPU hot tub?
[20016.46s -> 20028.18s]  And if you dropped a GPU into oil or something, right? What are those computers I see sometimes
[20029.27s -> 20035.99s]  where all the parts are just in oil? It's like an oil-cooled PC or something. It's weird. Mineral
[20035.99s -> 20054.30s]  oil. Does that work? Deep fried PC. I saw videos on it before where the entire computer is just
[20054.30s -> 20064.02s]  submerged in mineral oil, right? There's a lot of downsides to it, but it does sort of work, huh?
[20070.87s -> 20077.86s]  Well, I mean, problem number one is I really don't want to fry later sitting in my room just
[20078.68s -> 20095.37s]  ready to tip over. Oh, what do I want to eat? I just thought of like fried chicken. Somebody said
[20095.37s -> 20103.27s]  KFC. It'd be like Taco Bell or something. Re-cheesy godita crunches with the Doritos,
[20103.27s -> 20114.23s]  Locos, Tacos. Yep. I think that sounds like a great idea to me. That's the best thing there.
[20122.54s -> 20138.73s]  Oh, bean burrito? The cheesy godita crunch really might be the single most brilliant fast food
[20138.73s -> 20144.57s]  invention. It really is. I think it is like the best fast food item. Where did I put it on the
[20144.57s -> 20159.35s]  tier list? I put it up real high, didn't I? Where was it? Was it A? Was it S or was it A or B? It
[20159.35s -> 20175.14s]  was somewhere higher. It was A. Where did I put an S tier for fast food stuff? German 985 meal?
[20175.14s -> 20179.46s]  At Taco Bell, it's three cheesy godita crunches with Doritos, Tacos, and that's it. You just get
[20179.46s -> 20200.54s]  a drink. That's it. You don't get anything else. Not even the cinnamon things? No, no, I just want
[20201.34s -> 20207.26s]  I'm trying to really think the last time I ordered something else off the Taco Bell menu
[20207.26s -> 20215.37s]  that was not that. I don't think I ever have. Well, before the cheesy godita crunch came out,
[20215.37s -> 20222.49s]  I ordered tacos, the Mexican pizza they had there, chalupa, whatever. After cheesy godita crunch,
[20223.35s -> 20228.47s]  every single order was cheesy godita crunch. I've never ordered anything else off of that menu
[20229.03s -> 20250.06s]  since 1998, whenever it was. It's so good. It really is. It is so good. Oh, I'm getting it.
[20250.06s -> 20258.87s]  I want it right now. What's your opinion on the Crunch Wrap Supreme? It's not the cheesy
[20258.87s -> 20263.35s]  godita crunch, so I will never order it and I will never eat it. I've never had it and I never
[20263.35s -> 20271.35s]  will. There's no other reason. There's no reason for me to order it. All right, if Taco Bell pulls
[20271.91s -> 20278.30s]  a fast one here and they remove that off the menu, I'm not sure I would ever go there again.
[20278.30s -> 20284.07s]  I really don't think so. There's no reason for me to be there. I go to Taco Bell for the cheesy
[20284.07s -> 20301.37s]  godita crunch. If it's not there, I'm not going. Fuck you, German. The Crunch Wrap is a staple.
[20303.21s -> 20307.45s]  I'm sure it's good. It doesn't matter. I'm never going to order something that's not
[20307.45s -> 20311.99s]  the cheesy godita crunch. It's never going to happen. Because you could say, well, dude,
[20311.99s -> 20317.03s]  you get three cheesy godita crunches. Just order two and get a Crunch Wrap. No, no, no, no, no.
[20317.03s -> 20322.26s]  Excuse me. No, thank you. That's one full cheesy godita crunch I will not be able to enjoy.
[20323.64s -> 20331.75s]  I want the full satisfaction. I will take a bite of the Crunch Wrap Supreme and be sitting there
[20331.75s -> 20348.06s]  going, I wish this was a cheesy godita crunch. Why did I order it? I wish they would make
[20348.06s -> 20357.77s]  more cheesy godita crunch variants. They just have the normal one and then they have the Doritos
[20357.77s -> 20372.20s]  one. Make some different ones. You're a cheesy godita dunce. That was pretty good.
[20376.73s -> 20394.09s]  This place is so, how could dirt be in every single area? What even is 864p? Don't click it,
[20394.09s -> 20400.58s]  man. It was a part of a prank video I'm doing. We just finished the shoot and I don't want
[20400.58s -> 20412.70s]  anyone else to click on it. Just be careful. Don't click it. If you want to know, it's the,
[20412.70s -> 20417.82s]  it's a resolution that's divisible by 8, therefore it is true 16 by 9. If you don't
[20417.82s -> 20422.22s]  have a resolution that's divisible by 8, then the program has to do extra work
[20423.02s -> 20453.38s]  for pixels that don't exist. That's it. See, I'm smart, I know things. I mean, I would,
[20453.38s -> 20461.48s]  I want to up my bitrate, but I don't think I can. I think there's a cap on what you're allowed to
[20461.48s -> 20472.65s]  actually do for a bitrate. It was a huge frog burp and I hope nobody heard it. Yeah, 6k, yeah.
[20473.29s -> 20481.94s]  To have anything over 720 not look like ass at 60 FPS, that's got to be at least 8,000.
[20483.78s -> 20493.82s]  8, 9, 10,000. You can do 1080 30 and it will look probably fine. Either that or you have to have
[20493.82s -> 20501.43s]  such a monster CPU that you can drop the preset down to like slow or slowest and then you don't
[20501.43s -> 20513.50s]  need the bitrate. But I don't have a CPU that can do that. I haven't really tried though.
[20513.50s -> 20531.62s]  What OST is this? This is pretty good. I forgot what it was. What's my CPU? My CPU is, I actually
[20531.62s -> 20547.58s]  forget. It's a new computer. Oh, my CPU is a Ryzen 7 5800X 8 core. So it's a 5800X Ryzen 7
[20548.22s -> 20572.70s]  8 core. It has 30 webcams but not two PCs. Well, the 30 webcam stream, the problem was all the
[20572.70s -> 20577.56s]  the bus lanes. There's only a certain amount of lanes on a motherboard where you can plug in like
[20577.56s -> 20585.10s]  webcam but there's a solution for it. Actually, Community Jake and I have been talking about that
[20585.10s -> 20591.98s]  one and the solution for it is something we can do. Maybe it would be fun to do. I donated all the
[20591.98s -> 20601.19s]  webcams. I had like 30 webcams. Like I had like at least 20, 15. I just donated them. I couldn't
[20601.19s -> 20613.77s]  even use them. I was never gonna be able to use them. Did you sign them? No, why would I sign them?
[20613.85s -> 20641.96s]  30, 20, 15. Yeah, whatever. Buff, puke, whatever. Sidekick, puke. Oh, we have a horrible news.
[20641.96s -> 20647.72s]  Pizza the Hut ate himself in his car. He was locked in his car. What's that from Spaceballs?
[20647.72s -> 20666.82s]  Oh, that's a good movie. Pizza the Hut, he had to eat himself because he locked himself in his car.
[20667.46s -> 20687.96s]  I keep overlooking that from that movie. That guy literally ate himself and died. How do you eat
[20687.96s -> 20693.29s]  yourself? He was a pizza. If you didn't see Spaceballs, Pizza the Hut is a character who
[20693.29s -> 20699.67s]  is just a slice of pizza. He's disgusting. It's gross. There's like cheese falling off of him
[20699.67s -> 20717.64s]  and pepperonis and shit. It's really odd. He's a really fucking crazy character. The king of the
[20717.64s -> 20737.64s]  Schwartz. See you next time for Spaceballs 2. The search for more money. That's classic Mel Brooks,
[20737.64s -> 20754.12s]  man. There's not, I don't think there's very much Mel Brooks did that I didn't like.
[20754.92s -> 20782.50s]  Rick Moranis. He was so good in that movie too. What the hell am I looking at? There's a lot of
[20782.50s -> 20789.19s]  new people here, but that's my favorite gag ever. If you want to know what my all-time favorite
[20789.19s -> 20796.58s]  joke ever and any piece of media ever. Comedy, stand-up, movies, TV shows, video games. It's
[20796.58s -> 20801.94s]  that scene from Spaceballs where they have to put the Spaceballs movie into the fucking video player
[20802.74s -> 20809.75s]  to find out what they have to do next. That's, that is the best joke I've ever seen.
[20811.19s -> 20824.07s]  Nothing even comes close. Not even close. Oh, fast-forward this part. Yeah, I guess it's like
[20824.07s -> 20828.87s]  the embarrassing part where he like falls and like hits his head. He's like fast-forward this part.
[20828.87s -> 20834.73s]  In fact, never play this again. Then they go too far and they get to the point where they're
[20834.73s -> 20839.06s]  actually in the same part of the movie of them standing there looking at the screen.
[20839.70s -> 20844.92s]  It's like, what is this? And he's like, oh, it's now, sir. We're watching now.
[20845.48s -> 20853.40s]  How does this make any sense? This can't be. If you've never seen Spaceballs, that's required
[20853.40s -> 20873.06s]  reading for this stream. What's the syllabus? I could give you guys the syllabus.
[20874.42s -> 20879.14s]  That actually is funny to me. Should I make a syllabus for you guys of things you have to
[20879.14s -> 20896.23s]  watch before watching this stream? I like that. That's actually kind of funny. 85%. All right,
[20896.23s -> 20910.94s]  come on, let's go. The syllabus, by the way, has nothing to do with any of my content.
[20913.35s -> 20920.30s]  You don't have to go watch any of my videos. Just go watch Spaceballs three times. Watch
[20920.30s -> 20925.42s]  Ghostbusters one, Ghostbusters two, Gremlins two. Gremlins one is good, but Gremlins two is
[20925.42s -> 20954.55s]  better. I can make the whole syllabus for you. All the Shpee videos. Don't do that. Gremlins
[20954.55s -> 20959.03s]  two is also one of the most important movies of my entire life. So yeah, I would say that that is
[20959.03s -> 20974.26s]  huge too. Who Framed Roger Rabbit? That's another one that's incredibly important, required reading.
[20974.26s -> 20990.76s]  That's embarrassing. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is embarrassing? That's in the Library of Congress.
[20991.56s -> 21010.66s]  Cars two is in the Library of Congress. Doesn't matter. 86%. What's something that I have not
[21010.66s -> 21025.05s]  done at all? Oh, down here. What about Robocop? Robocop is good, but I wouldn't put that in my
[21025.05s -> 21036.17s]  required reading list. Gorilla's Demon Days and Plastic Beach. Also required reading.
[21046.26s -> 21055.93s]  What else is in there? And Plastic Beach. Yeah, I really like Plastic Beach a lot.
[21056.65s -> 21062.46s]  A lot. I thought it was fantastic. A lot of people might not agree with that, but
[21063.18s -> 21068.62s]  I think that's... It's really easy to say Demon Days is the best album, but I think Plastic
[21068.62s -> 21073.94s]  Beach is. I know people are going to be like, no fucking way, but I just really... Replayability,
[21073.94s -> 21079.32s]  re-listenability. I've listened to Plastic Beach's songs more than I have Demon Days.
[21081.58s -> 21090.31s]  And Demon Days is just a rock solid. Just absolute banger after banger. But for some reason,
[21090.31s -> 21116.86s]  Plastic Beach just did it more for me. I don't know why. 89. I mean, I think that arrow,
[21117.54s -> 21121.78s]  Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Gorilla's, I think that's the best. That's when they were at their
[21121.78s -> 21134.71s]  absolute peak. That's not to say that I didn't like humans, but Plastic Beach and Demon Days
[21134.71s -> 21145.90s]  are way better. Song Machine is good too. I actually haven't really given it much listen.
[21145.90s -> 21157.85s]  I'll have to do that. I liked that single they came out with. What was it called? Humility?
[21163.27s -> 21167.03s]  I like that song.
[21173.08s -> 21199.80s]  That was really good. That's from the Now Now. I actually... People were really mixed on
[21199.80s -> 21230.54s]  Saturn bars. I really liked it. I thought it was really good. 91%. This one is the longest out of
[21230.54s -> 21240.34s]  all of them. I like Moments was good too. Moments was just all... It was just super. When you put
[21240.34s -> 21263.78s]  Moments on it, my whole body would just move. I'm so happy De La Soul continued to do stuff
[21263.78s -> 21271.18s]  with the Gorilla's. They're so good. A lot of times, the Gorilla's will have that one-off
[21271.90s -> 21274.06s]  where it's like, oh yeah, they were on that Gorilla's album that one time,
[21274.06s -> 21292.55s]  but De La Soul is just on every album. I love it. What am I missing? There's a lot of places
[21292.55s -> 21302.14s]  I'm missing. Where is it? Trash. Lou Reed collab with them too. Yeah, what was the Lou Reed song?
[21302.70s -> 21314.81s]  I forget what it was. It was in Plastic Beach, right? Yeah, it was Plastic Beach. Oh yeah,
[21314.81s -> 21329.21s]  some kind of nature. That's right. I love Stylo too though. Stylo was awesome. That was a driving
[21329.21s -> 21369.48s]  song. It really was. Bruce Willis video was rad. Yeah, it was. Now you make me want to listen to
[21369.48s -> 21384.54s]  the Gorilla's. I love to do that with my cheesy Gordita Crunch. Is this already clean? Kind of.
[21384.54s -> 21404.68s]  Different nozzle. That's the problem. There it is. It sounds like the Dr. House song.
[21404.68s -> 21416.68s]  It's a song called Teardrop, right? Can I play this for a second on stream? Are we allowed to
[21416.68s -> 21424.07s]  enjoy anything in 2021? Am I allowed to make a reference to any media I've ever watched and
[21424.07s -> 21429.14s]  thought was cool to share with anybody? No? I have to lock myself in my fucking room, turn the lights
[21429.14s -> 21433.06s]  off, close all the windows, put headphones on and not tell anybody I ever listen to it.
[21433.70s -> 21454.97s]  I would play it right now. What the fuck? Whatever. Oh, this is very dirty under here.
[21459.13s -> 21471.32s]  This is a lot of fun. This is very therapeutic. If you're looking for a game that's just
[21471.32s -> 21482.76s]  therapeutic. This is one of them. This is fun. I like this. This is early access. I wonder what
[21482.76s -> 21495.03s]  they're going to put in the full game. I'm curious. It doesn't need to be anything else, right? It
[21495.03s -> 21510.66s]  knows exactly what it is. That's what it's going to give you. That's it. Almost 1K in the bank.
[21510.66s -> 21525.13s]  Almost. Wait, this is genuinely a waste of life. Wait, what are you talking about? What?
[21531.42s -> 21534.94s]  I'm just spraying some walls, man. I'm just hanging out, man.
[21539.78s -> 21553.83s]  You can say that about anything. Why have you not played the Bugsnax LST? I don't think I can. I
[21553.83s -> 21576.54s]  think that song is copyright, isn't it? It's a waste of life. What the fuck? Let's go with the big one.
[21576.54s -> 21588.54s]  I think this is, yeah, that's fine. Okay. Well, there it goes. IRL power washing stream. When?
[21588.54s -> 21595.22s]  Nope. I'll keep it in the head. I'll keep it up here. You might see it eventually. I think that'd
[21595.22s -> 21619.51s]  be fun. Almost done. Man, this is a pain in the ass. This one doesn't want to go. I've got to get
[21619.51s -> 21634.98s]  the other side. How am I going to get that? Are we going to get into through the ages stream?
[21636.68s -> 21643.18s]  I don't know. That was kind of fun for a little while. Maybe. That was pretty fun. Maybe we should
[21643.18s -> 21653.24s]  do that. A lot more people here now than were here before. I'll give you some context. Those
[21653.24s -> 21657.40s]  that don't know what we're talking about. So through the ages stream was, there was a website
[21657.40s -> 21662.52s]  that was made that pulled every single stream I've ever done, every single video I've ever uploaded,
[21663.24s -> 21670.97s]  and it picked a random timestamp randomly across one of those places. So it randomly picked the
[21670.97s -> 21676.74s]  video and then randomly picked the timestamp. And the idea was we were supposed to see what we got.
[21677.38s -> 21686.06s]  I did it with channel points. I don't think I'll even do it with channel points this time.
[21686.06s -> 21691.11s]  It'll probably just be like five minutes. Just five minutes or 10 minutes it just switches
[21691.11s -> 21707.80s]  automatically. I'm gonna get up. Is there a ladder? What about another royalty-free movie night? Yeah,
[21707.80s -> 21712.04s]  I'd want to make sure that the movies were good and not just, because the movies we watched were
[21712.04s -> 21723.96s]  funny. Is there any more Ritz Brothers movies? That's all I care about. It can't be Bionicle.
[21723.96s -> 21730.66s]  I looked into it. That's like a copywritten movie. I can't broadcast that. Even if it's free on the
[21730.66s -> 21736.82s]  internet, I don't have the rights to broadcast it. I need something that there are no rights holders.
[21737.54s -> 21744.42s]  There are still people that own the rights to all the media around Bionicle. I can't stream it.
[21744.98s -> 21761.99s]  Do it anyways. Oh, okay. All right. Well, I'll see when the channel gets deleted.
[21762.55s -> 21767.24s]  It was a good run. Should I throw it all away for Bionicle? What do you think?
[21767.24s -> 21784.50s]  I mean, that'd be kind of a hilarious last stream ever. That would be lame as hell if that was my
[21784.50s -> 21804.12s]  final stream. I mean, it kind of would be. What if you did it with Joe Biden? What would, how would
[21804.12s -> 21810.55s]  they, what would, they wouldn't be able to do anything but about the president. I'm not going
[21810.55s -> 21827.27s]  to stream this. Just make a movie and watch it. I mean, I made a thousand YouTube videos.
[21827.99s -> 21849.61s]  We've watched a bunch of those already. When is Otto's Pogtastic Adventure? I don't know. I have
[21849.61s -> 21866.31s]  to make it. Streamer videos, resident sleeper. Everybody's entitled to their opinion. You can
[21866.31s -> 21871.02s]  have that. You can, you can think my shit sucks if you want. That's fine. I'm not going to combat you
[21871.02s -> 21878.95s]  on that. You are free to have an opinion, which you have. I can't change that. All I can do is
[21878.95s -> 21894.20s]  say thanks for watching. Thanks for coming here. Thanks for spending your day here. I was going to
[21894.20s -> 21899.00s]  scream. I was going to just scream like, get the fuck out of it. I was going to scream it.
[21899.00s -> 21905.38s]  My voice is already kind of fucked up and I thought it might've scared a bunch of people.
[21905.38s -> 21921.54s]  So I didn't do it. Some people are probably actually lying down right now and I don't want
[21921.54s -> 21934.90s]  to scream in their ear. Shit, I got to move the ladder. Wait, no, I don't. Can I just get up here?
[21935.54s -> 21961.13s]  Some people are probably asleep. Should we like fuck with their dreams? How do we do that? Like,
[21961.13s -> 21969.94s]  just talk about how they're asleep right now. You're asleep right now. You sleeping right now. I
[21969.94s -> 21977.40s]  know you're asleep. Wake up for a sec. Look around you. This is a dream. Don't worry. This is a dream.
[21977.40s -> 21991.13s]  It's me, Derma, talking to you. Sleeping. Make sure you take the trash out. Go back to bed now.
[21991.13s -> 21995.38s]  I don't have anything funny to say. I thought I might have something funny to say, but I didn't
[21995.38s -> 22002.89s]  come up with anything quick enough. So I told you to do a small chore. Go back to bed. This is a
[22002.97s -> 22025.72s]  dream. It's a dream. Don't worry. You're fine. It's a dream. 20,455. 20,460. 20,466. 20,600.
[22028.09s -> 22036.33s]  Oh, get me off. I can't take it. That's not a prime number. Whatever. I don't know. I don't
[22036.33s -> 22050.09s]  know prime numbers. Put on forest sound effects. Make them think they're in the woods. Put an ocean
[22050.09s -> 22054.01s]  sound effect. Hey, you're asleep right now and you're in the ocean. All right. Yeah. Let's
[22054.01s -> 22070.52s]  make them think they're in the ocean. Hey there. It's me, Derma985 on the beach with you.
[22071.16s -> 22076.14s]  This is a dream. Don't worry. Don't get up. Just take in the salty air.
[22076.70s -> 22090.04s]  Hear the seagulls. Ah, it's so fresh out here. Don't you think? What I want you to do is I want
[22090.04s -> 22097.74s]  you to let go. Anything negative that you're thinking of is the waves. And you and me here,
[22098.30s -> 22107.05s]  when you wake from your sleep, don't get up. Don't get up. It's okay. You're going to go
[22107.77s -> 22115.29s]  to twitch.tv slash Derma985. If you're not already, which you have to be because you're
[22115.29s -> 22128.68s]  here with me in a dream. Ah, you're going to. I was going to say sub to me and shit,
[22128.68s -> 22136.18s]  but I don't want to do that. It's still a dream. Don't it's you're still in a dream.
[22136.74s -> 22147.34s]  Look at the boat go by. Wow. Watch the seagulls. Look above you. They just flew up one shit in my
[22147.34s -> 22163.98s]  mouth. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, don't get up right now. You're still in a dream.
[22164.62s -> 22174.47s]  When you rise, I want you to just have a new clean day, clear day, clear head after this.
[22174.47s -> 22183.45s]  You're going to watch Derma's streams. He's so good. He's so funny. He's like the funniest guy
[22183.45s -> 22192.18s]  on Twitch. And continue to watch. He's like your favorite. Let's hear the waves and my voice.
[22192.82s -> 22199.61s]  I snap my fingers. You're going to wake up and you're going to act like a chicken.
[22201.82s -> 22220.39s]  The audience is going to laugh in three, two, one. You're up. You're up. I don't know, man.
[22220.39s -> 22224.39s]  I was going to do like the sub thing, but like I got caught halfway through and I just,
[22224.39s -> 22243.19s]  it felt very ugly and I didn't want to do it. Fuck, fuck. Oh, everybody's laughing. I can't
[22243.19s -> 22252.89s]  believe it. He's doing a chicken. He's doing a chicken noise. Statistically, you have at least
[22252.89s -> 22261.38s]  one celebrity fan. Who do you think it is? It's you. So I got to figure out who you are.
[22263.30s -> 22266.74s]  You are literally the celebrity in your underwear watching the stream right now.
[22268.58s -> 22272.18s]  And you asked me that question. So I wonder who you are. I'm going to say,
[22280.01s -> 22298.52s]  who would word it like that? The Grinch? The Grinch is not a person.
[22299.51s -> 22316.49s]  It's a character that an actor plays. It's not Vin Diesel. No, it's not. No, who is it then?
[22316.49s -> 22322.58s]  I don't know. Who is that? Yeah. You know what? It's probably like a senator or something. It's
[22322.58s -> 22336.26s]  probably, it's probably like a congressman or like a congresswoman or something. And it's probably
[22336.26s -> 22357.37s]  like a congressman that you would not expect. Dave State. It's Mitch McConnell. I was asleep
[22357.93s -> 22363.61s]  during German on at fives as well as a stream. And he was very, very kind to me.
[22363.61s -> 22377.85s]  And he told me to be the best I can. So what I've decided is I've decided that there will be no more
[22379.38s -> 22389.91s]  stimulus. We don't need another stimulus. I've decided to stimulate German's bank account
[22389.91s -> 22399.74s]  by providing $200 million to his bank account. All in favor of that stimulus, say aye.
[22399.74s -> 22436.97s]  That's not even how it works. Don't you have to vote? Mitch McConnell. Guys, I don't think
[22436.97s -> 22440.57s]  it's Mitch McConnell. I think Mitch McConnell still has trouble opening up web browsers.
[22440.57s -> 22453.75s]  I think Mitch McConnell still needs to call his son to ask him how, like, Microsoft Network still
[22453.75s -> 22472.94s]  works. Like, yeah, I would feel like he has like an MSN account, don't you? Mitch McConnell's the
[22472.94s -> 22493.64s]  kind of guy that has like an at AOL email. All right, what's left? Okay, the monkey bars,
[22494.28s -> 22508.01s]  tools, the bin. What bin? The trash bin? What's wrong with this? Is it the back? Oh,
[22508.01s -> 22519.53s]  shit. It's up there. This place looks pretty good. I can't wait to see the time lapse.
[22519.53s -> 22542.42s]  There's a second bin. I'll go look. And by the way, what level of celebrity are you guys talking
[22542.42s -> 22549.90s]  about? Are you talking about an A list celebrity? Are you talking about like a person of interest
[22549.90s -> 22554.46s]  or something? Like an A list. I don't know if any A list celebrities watch this stream.
[22563.40s -> 22573.40s]  You think it's Tom Holland? I don't think so. I don't know. Might be. Imagine if I imagine ever
[22573.40s -> 22577.48s]  meeting somebody like a comic con or something. Oh, yeah. Like at the autograph signing or
[22577.48s -> 22585.48s]  something. It's like, Oh, hey, Mitch McConnell. Oh, Mitch McConnell. Wow. I can't believe you're
[22585.48s -> 22593.16s]  at Comic Con. I mean, I may as well be being a rubber mask. I might be a scary monster. But
[22593.40s -> 22607.62s]  I may as well be a scary guy. So Tom Holland. I fucked up the whole thing. Going up to Tom
[22607.62s -> 22611.54s]  Holland at Comic Con or something and getting something signed. And then being like, Oh,
[22611.54s -> 22618.42s]  here you go. What's the name? The name? Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy. Oh, yeah. And he leans in and
[22618.42s -> 22633.88s]  just whispers into my ear, I love that Mitch McConnell voice. What would I do? I love that
[22633.88s -> 22654.97s]  Mitch McConnell voice you do. Hang out with me. Should I scream that? What's left? Oh, over there.
[22654.97s -> 22666.58s]  Okay. I'd be like, Oh, Spider-Man is my favorite character. Spider-Man is my favorite character.
[22666.58s -> 22673.30s]  I love Spider-Man. Spider-Man is my favorite character. And he'd go, All right, man. And I'd
[22673.30s -> 22678.58s]  be like, Oh, it's me, Mitch McConnell. I can't do it. Hold on. Miss Damien. I can't. You liked it,
[22678.58s -> 22692.70s]  though. I love Spider-Man. I would have to do his favorite character in front of him. I would get
[22692.70s -> 22697.50s]  it so wrong. I would be so choked up like this. I wouldn't be able to do anything. But I would
[22697.50s -> 22700.22s]  have to do another character instead. I'd be like, You like Mitch McConnell, but I'll give you another
[22700.22s -> 22717.35s]  one. Here's SpongeBob. And security just grabs me. And then somebody a week later comes in with a
[22717.35s -> 22724.18s]  username. Nice SpongeBob, LOL. Nice SpongeBob impression, LOL. And I know it's him. That's
[22724.18s -> 22743.53s]  their username. Oh, it's inside. This is a huge fan fiction. No, it's not. This is not real. This
[22743.53s -> 22760.98s]  is just make believe of nothing. Self-insert fanfic. Yeah, I know. Whatever. What's not clean?
[22762.86s -> 22786.89s]  Stools. What else? Uh, the bars. That's the only factual thing you've heard me say in this stream
[22786.89s -> 22793.77s]  so far. Is the cheesy Godita crunch is the best item at Taco Bell. And that we need to redo our
[22793.77s -> 22806.18s]  education system. Those are the only two things I've said that are real. What is left? A bench.
[22806.18s -> 22823.80s]  Which one? Underneath? This one? No, it's the other one, right? So what about when you said you never
[22823.80s -> 22832.18s]  pooed your diaper? I did probably a lot. I did probably all the time. When I was one. A lot of
[22832.18s -> 22836.42s]  you guys don't want to hear this, but you probably have filled, you yourself, you listening to this
[22836.42s -> 22842.09s]  right now, have filled probably two to three thousand diapers of shit. You don't want to
[22842.09s -> 22871.85s]  hear that though. But you did. What do you mean question marks? Oh, almost there. I have 1,160.
[22875.54s -> 22887.66s]  Oh, cool. What about you throwing up orange juice on the floor? Yes, that was real. Golf cart.
[22888.22s -> 22900.97s]  This will be quick. This will be really quick. Give me the big one. Give me the, uh, no. Should
[22901.05s -> 22927.19s]  I just spray? This should do it. Yeah, this will be quick. Okay. I got to get the other nozzle.
[22927.83s -> 22934.76s]  You said you missed the whole screen because your Wi-Fi died. Oh shit. I'm sorry.
[22945.56s -> 22966.55s]  But mud. Get it. Who covered the cart in cheese? I think what the actual question is who took the
[22966.55s -> 23011.99s]  cart off-roading? Jackass. Johnny Knoxville. Maybe it's Johnny Knoxville. You're gonna do
[23011.99s -> 23021.00s]  more VR streams? I am gonna do more VR streams. That's coming up soon. I actually think I might be
[23021.80s -> 23030.25s]  getting an index because the Vive is, I like my Vive, but I broke the controller. So I need to
[23030.25s -> 23036.52s]  get the knuckle controllers anyways. I think I kind of want to upgrade. So I'll probably just,
[23036.52s -> 23046.22s]  I'll probably donate the one I have now to another one because I had the original Vive,
[23046.86s -> 23055.77s]  not the Vive Pro or the new one. That, I think that was the original Vive.
[23056.49s -> 23072.65s]  I'll probably get an index. Isn't there another one? What's it called? There's another one that's
[23072.65s -> 23110.33s]  coming out too. Isn't there? Wait, 1250? Well, all right. I have enough. The Oculus Quest 2 is good,
[23110.33s -> 23117.93s]  but requires Facebook. And the Reverb G2 is supposedly really good too. I'll probably just
[23117.93s -> 23123.37s]  get the index. I feel like that's the one to get if you were going to get one. All right. Medium duty.
[23123.37s -> 23133.61s]  Here we go. Surface more, more, more. Oily ingrained. What's that do? All right. So now I
[23133.61s -> 23144.42s]  already got the attachments for it, right? So now I got this detached house. This place is huge.
[23144.98s -> 23151.74s]  Reverb G2 is great when WMR decides to work properly. Index is a goodbye if you're just
[23151.74s -> 23164.07s]  going to do strange stuff. Okay. All right. So where, where's my, where's my new nozzle?
[23164.63s -> 23181.62s]  Just bought it. Where is it? Isn't it one of these ones here? Medium duty, the Urban XU2.
[23182.18s -> 23195.61s]  I own the attachment. Where is it? I didn't equip it. How do I equip it? Oh, E. Okay. And we'll do
[23195.61s -> 23208.57s]  the extension. Ooh, that's better. All right. I think I should be able to do this now, right?
[23219.03s -> 23238.47s]  Looks like a gas tank. It's not optimal. I like going side to side. It's much better for my brain.
[23249.06s -> 23277.67s]  Yeah. What the fuck? This thing sucks. I just take it off. This thing sucks. Dope. Oh shit.
[23277.67s -> 23281.75s]  That's right. I should do soap. Oh, I don't have the soap nozzle. It's like 500 bucks.
[23291.29s -> 23321.99s]  Even this, maybe this is just really dirty. Shoot closer. It's the distance.
[23322.71s -> 23373.46s]  It is kind of distance, isn't it? All right. Not bad. Nice. There we go. Looks better. Change the
[23373.46s -> 23381.74s]  radio. Oh, about. All right. This, this is probably going to be the last thing we do
[23381.74s -> 23386.57s]  after this house. I'd probably call it. What's, um, what's a good one?
[23396.54s -> 23403.74s]  Ape escape. Oh, I like plants versus zombies. That's a good one. That's a good one.
[23403.74s -> 23418.74s]  All right. Let's go. We're zombies. We're coming.
[23428.18s -> 23443.74s]  And if only they made the second game, not a never ending cash grab or pop cap. Pop cap had
[23443.74s -> 23452.57s]  so many cool games. Can you imagine not making an insane aquarium? Another one. Why won't they make
[23452.57s -> 23456.49s]  another one? Why would they not have met? I would have rather taken the pay to win insane aquarium.
[23465.38s -> 23472.31s]  They just leaned so heavy into plants versus zombies. It made like five games of plants versus
[23472.31s -> 23503.75s]  zombies. It's like, I, I will give me something else. It's my favorite PS2 game. Um, what is my
[23503.75s -> 23527.37s]  favorite PS2 game? Oh, I don't know. I don't think so. Favorite PS2 game. I don't remember a lot of
[23527.37s -> 23551.14s]  PS2. I really don't because I have my favorite N64 game. It was no mercy. WWF no mercy. That was
[23551.14s -> 23576.68s]  probably my favorite game of that whole generation. This thing actually is much more powerful. I like
[23576.68s -> 23609.11s]  it. All right. That's that. Let's go back to this one. This is going a lot smoother. I'm already at
[23609.11s -> 23627.93s]  10%. It's going way smoother. Are you going to make a TikTok account? I'm not going to make a
[23627.93s -> 23635.02s]  TikTok account. So sorry. All of you anxiously anticipating a TikTok account. You're not going
[23635.02s -> 23654.25s]  to get it. Already 10, 11%. Holy shit. No, no TikTok. I'm not making any more accounts or any
[23654.25s -> 23660.22s]  more platforms. I'll tell you, I got to be honest with everybody here. This is it. I ain't moving
[23660.22s -> 23666.26s]  again. I went from YouTube to Twitch. I'm not going from Twitch to like TikTok or something.
[23666.90s -> 23697.77s]  No, this is it. This is where the story ends. I got to get the ladder for that one. Oh, that's caked
[23697.77s -> 23710.01s]  on there. Was that ink? That's really caked on there. Check this out. Oof, really caked on there.
[23710.57s -> 23759.02s]  There we go. End's dirty. I can't get up there. How old am I again? 35. Good. Good. Very good.
[23759.02s -> 23780.46s]  Very good. Very good. I like it. Give me the ding. Come on. I need the ladder. Where's the ladder on
[23780.46s -> 23801.45s]  this level? I'm asking you like you guys know. All right. There we go. Ladder. This is a pretty
[23801.45s -> 23820.30s]  good spot. How do you fast forward? You can't. I'm sorry. You have to suffer through me playing a
[23820.38s -> 23840.14s]  chores game. These are my favorite games. You know it. I know it. We all know it. Go to the swirl.
[23849.14s -> 23882.57s]  Did they actually make them that do this? That's kind of cool. This is a big house. God. Celebrity
[23882.57s -> 23892.89s]  that watches him is Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese is not an A-list celebrity. Chuck E. Cheese
[23892.89s -> 23898.49s]  is one of those people that they get to be on like one of the seasons of Survivor or something.
[23898.49s -> 23913.29s]  You know what I mean? It's like, oh yeah, I remember you. He's famous. He's a celebrity,
[23913.29s -> 23921.94s]  but he's not an A-list celebrity. No, no, no. I didn't say I hate Chuck E. Cheese. I just said
[23921.94s -> 23929.53s]  he's not an A-list celebrity. I'm not an A-list celebrity. And look, Chuck E. Cheese is way more
[23929.53s -> 23956.74s]  famous and popular than I am. He would get invited onto Survivor. I wouldn't. Who covered for you?
[23956.74s -> 23975.70s]  What do you mean covered for me? What do you mean he covered for me? What did he cover me for?
[23976.34s -> 24011.82s]  Fun fact, you can hear zombies on your lawn here. That's a pretty fun fact. Liar. Celebrity tier list.
[24015.08s -> 24039.85s]  But what would that even mean? Like who do I think is the coolest celebrity? Who's the most famous
[24039.85s -> 24058.31s]  celebrity? It's probably Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is an S, I think. Brad Pitt. Yeah, S. It's Brad Pitt and
[24058.31s -> 24094.70s]  Tom Hanks. Brad Pitt is absolutely an S tier. Don't even tell me that. Of course he is. But Joe Biden.
[24094.70s -> 24110.01s]  Joe Biden is a politician. If you're a politician, you're already a known person
[24110.01s -> 24114.01s]  because you're a politician. We're talking about people that are like movie and TV show actors.
[24115.13s -> 24135.37s]  Tom Cruise. Yep. Kenneth Paltrow. I don't know. Not so much. Not so much really anymore. I don't
[24135.37s -> 24147.51s]  think. No. Jennifer Aniston. I would put probably an S tier. Yeah, Jennifer Aniston is probably S
[24147.51s -> 24166.17s]  tier. George Clooney. Who-ing Jennifer Aniston. What are you talking about? One of the most famous
[24166.17s -> 24191.02s]  people ever. Where does Kathy Mitchell go though? I would be more happy and more starstruck meeting
[24191.02s -> 24204.04s]  Kathy Mitchell than Jennifer Aniston. I'm serious. I would be nervous around Kathy Mitchell.
[24226.06s -> 24228.22s]  Kids, I have a surprise for you.
[24235.13s -> 24239.61s]  The following is a paid advertisement for the Express Ready, Set, Go! brought to you by GT
[24239.61s -> 24245.13s]  Direct, Lewisville, Colorado. We don't have time in our busy lives to wait for food,
[24245.13s -> 24250.57s]  so we fall into the fast food rut or buy carb-filled snacks. Well, millions have
[24250.57s -> 24256.81s]  discovered the secret. I love this lady. She's one of the best entertainers, one of the best hosts
[24256.81s -> 24264.65s]  ever. Even desserts. All thanks to the original Express 101. What would you say? Here comes Kathy
[24264.65s -> 24277.53s]  Mitchell. What's his name? Mama Farigno. Mama Farigno. What's his name? Joe Farigno and Kathy
[24277.53s -> 24293.13s]  Mitchell. Introduce them already. Introduce them. Oh, look at how good that looks.
[24294.65s -> 24300.01s]  You select for your family. This is possible thanks to breakthrough design advances.
[24300.01s -> 24306.49s]  All right. Well, where is she? This is just resident sleeper until we get to.
[24310.25s -> 24318.78s]  The Express Ready, Set, Go! Just like millions of you, the Express 101 is always there for me.
[24319.66s -> 24329.74s]  Joe Farigno. Joe Farago. It's not Kathy Mitchell.
[24330.22s -> 24334.70s]  Yes.
[24343.82s -> 24348.70s]  What a star. She's an S tier.
[24348.94s -> 24353.90s]  And look at these pies. Blueberry, even cherry. You couldn't do that before. You've improved
[24353.90s -> 24364.86s]  on perfection. I think we've made it even more perfect. Come on, Joe. She's S tier. I would
[24364.86s -> 24371.13s]  watch this whole thing right now. I don't know if I can. This is the Express Ready, Set, Go!
[24371.13s -> 24376.33s]  Well, Kathy, this is beautiful. And it is ready. Look what we've done. We took out that center
[24376.33s -> 24380.41s]  divider. So now you have 25% more cooking area. Can I watch this? Is this going to be right?
[24380.41s -> 24384.65s]  Exactly right. I just think Kathy Mitchell is fantastic. I really do.
[24384.65s -> 24388.97s]  Now, this is my almost instant pizza dough. And the recipe comes with it. All you have to do is
[24388.97s -> 24393.21s]  pop it in there and then put one over the other. And I like to call it a pizza cookie. Yeah,
[24393.21s -> 24399.29s]  I call it a cookie pizza. Where is it? I make a cookie, make a pizza. I call it a cookie pizza.
[24399.29s -> 24412.41s]  Come on, where is it? I call it a pizza. Where is it? It's my favorite line.
[24412.41s -> 24446.57s]  Kathy Mitchell is S tier. I would rather, I would pay a thousand dollars to like meet
[24446.57s -> 24465.74s]  and greet Kathy Mitchell versus, I don't care about any other celebrity. Why? Because I,
[24465.74s -> 24481.62s]  she's cool. And she's so good on camera too. She's so quick. She's so good on camera.
[24481.62s -> 24511.83s]  You can't teach that. She's so natural in front of the camera. Can we pay you a thousand dollars
[24511.83s -> 24517.75s]  to stop talking about the infomercial lady? It's been five minutes. I've been, what do you,
[24517.75s -> 24539.78s]  it's been, I'll tell you, Kathy Mitchell was very, very comforting. I remember being,
[24539.78s -> 24546.18s]  I don't care. I don't care. I'm talking about it. I remember a lot of these, these Kathy Mitchell
[24546.18s -> 24552.01s]  infomercials would air at one, two, three o'clock in the morning. And this is back,
[24552.01s -> 24555.85s]  I think when I was in high school and college and stuff, it was so comforting to hear Kathy
[24555.85s -> 24561.16s]  Mitchell's voice. It was, watch them. It was so nice. It was wonderful. Just having to go
[24561.16s -> 24593.00s]  fall asleep to it. Yeah, it was great. Anytime whenever I was like half asleep and I'd be like,
[24593.08s -> 24597.48s]  and now coming up next, ready, set, go. And I'd be like, hold on. She in this one?
[24598.20s -> 24602.47s]  And if it wasn't, I'd be like, nah, I changed channel. But if it's like, and you're coming up
[24602.47s -> 24607.11s]  weird, we have our resident host, Kathy Mitchell. And I'd be like, put it on, turn the volume up
[24607.11s -> 24624.78s]  higher. And now you have my attention. I'm honest. I probably really am Kathy Mitchell's number one
[24624.78s -> 24637.19s]  fan. I don't think anybody else can say that. I think just me. I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
[24637.75s -> 24644.95s]  No, I'm fucking fine. Everybody relax. I just think an introversial lady is cool. What's wrong
[24644.95s -> 24663.74s]  with that? What's wrong with that? Why is everybody treating me like I'm crazy? Shit.
[24673.56s -> 24707.74s]  I can't even. All right, let's go. Oh God. Whatever. I got to get this hole on the side.
[24707.74s -> 24733.78s]  This house is so dirty. Did a fucking volcano erupt on their house?
[24750.86s -> 24753.74s]  No, this is from years of not cleaning the roof.
[24758.42s -> 24771.62s]  Express 101. The Express ready, set, go. The snack master. Kathy Mitchell's dump cakes.
[24772.55s -> 24782.74s]  Kathy Mitchell's dump meals. Kathy Mitchell's copper pan. Kathy Mitchell's square pan.
[24784.63s -> 24792.76s]  Kathy Mitchell's turbo cooker. I've seen them all. All of them. Many times over.
[24793.32s -> 24816.68s]  How many did I buy? None of them. Oh, except I think my family had the snack master. I'm pretty
[24816.68s -> 24841.53s]  sure they did. Fake fan. What are you talking about? What do you mean fake fan? I had the snack master.
[24844.33s -> 24850.65s]  And I had the copper pan. Kathy Mitchell's copper pan. I had it. The only pan I had.
[24868.89s -> 24873.29s]  Your family had it. What do you mean my family had it? I had the copper pan.
[24878.36s -> 24884.46s]  I had the copper pan. I bought the copper pan. Like five years ago. Four or five years ago.
[24891.85s -> 24897.69s]  Show it. I don't have the pan anymore. I stopped using it like six years ago or something. I bought
[24897.69s -> 24903.54s]  it like five years ago. Oh wait, I got caught. Hold on. I bought this pan when I was still in
[24903.54s -> 24908.90s]  Massachusetts. I did not bring the pan to Vegas. It was the copper pan. Kathy Mitchell's face was
[24908.90s -> 24920.46s]  on it. It's not a lie. I'm not lying. I had the Kathy Mitchell copper pan. I only bought it because
[24920.46s -> 24953.30s]  her name was on it. Her face was on it. Yes. 30% that's it. Oh goodness. Buy another one right now.
[24953.86s -> 24968.71s]  No, I don't need it. Actually, I kind of do actually. I could use a new pan. Maybe I'll buy it.
[24968.71s -> 25000.65s]  Maybe I'll get the Kathy Mitchell copper pan again. The big one. There we are. Buy it if you're a real
[25000.65s -> 25014.07s]  fan. I'll probably get it. It was good. It actually worked. Buy the XL square copper pan. Yeah, that's
[25014.07s -> 25020.79s]  the one. My square copper pan is better than all the others. Let me show you. I'm putting two
[25020.79s -> 25027.67s]  tablespoons of teaspoons. I'm adding two cups of flour and a little bit of milk. My copper pan
[25027.67s -> 25045.98s]  is better than all the other pans. Look at that steak. Yeah, I bought it. And they always put a
[25045.98s -> 25055.54s]  piece of cheese in there. Why do they do that? They put one piece of cheddar cheese in the pan
[25056.10s -> 25065.00s]  and they cook the cheese. Who the fuck is cooking cheese in a pan? And as you see, I'm cooking cheese
[25065.00s -> 25069.96s]  in this pan and the cheese does not stick to the bottom. Why are you cooking a piece of cheese?
[25070.60s -> 25083.30s]  To show the quality. That's the point. A grilled cheese. No, but you don't just put a slice of
[25083.30s -> 25089.45s]  cheese in the pan. How many times has this happened to you when you're cooking slices of
[25089.45s -> 25104.98s]  cheese in your pan? To show it will not stick to the pan. To show it doesn't stick. I love when
[25104.98s -> 25111.46s]  that guy says technology too. With anti-stick technology. There's always a technology.
[25111.46s -> 25119.02s]  With vacuum-sealed technology. The word technology in infomercials was the best way to make anybody
[25119.02s -> 25127.22s]  over the age of 70 to pick the phone up and buy it. With true cooking technology. It's a convection
[25127.22s -> 25135.35s]  oven. That's it. The super cooker cooks around all sides with our patented super turbo cooking
[25135.35s -> 25145.72s]  technology. It's a convection oven. Done. Oh, technology. It's got, it's got technology in it.
[25145.72s -> 25162.20s]  I'll call that number right now. Hey PeacefulHaley, thanks for the 10 community subs. I think I missed
[25162.20s -> 25184.94s]  a bunch of other subs too. Thank you though. Apparently also works on you. Also, look at it.
[25184.94s -> 25201.27s]  It looks even better already. You won't shut up about it. You're doing E3 next week? I am.
[25201.27s -> 25207.06s]  We're doing the Microsoft conference. So next time you're going to see my face is Saturday
[25207.70s -> 25212.26s]  at the Microsoft conference. Well, I won't be there, but I will be streaming it.
[25212.90s -> 25219.10s]  I've been giving our reactions to things. I wonder what they got in store for us this time.
[25225.82s -> 25240.31s]  Yes, Saturday is a React Andy stream. It is. Is Microsoft Sunday? I thought Microsoft Saturday.
[25240.31s -> 25248.55s]  When is the Microsoft conference? Is it Saturday or Sunday? Got like 10 AM Pacific. Yeah.
[25249.53s -> 25252.25s]  Sunday. Oh, okay. Well, whenever the Microsoft one is, that's what I'm doing.
[25252.89s -> 25270.54s]  No Nintendo? No, Nintendos are usually, they're always like on like a Tuesday or something.
[25271.10s -> 25275.42s]  And they're always like 40 minutes long. And I really don't know what the hell to do afterwards.
[25276.06s -> 25290.71s]  So no, no Nintendo. And it's really early in the morning too. It's like nine, eight or nine
[25290.71s -> 25309.26s]  o'clock in the morning. He hates Nintendo and Luigi. It's not true, but I have not played a
[25309.26s -> 25316.20s]  Nintendo game all the way through since like Mario galaxy. I mean, I guess you can count
[25316.20s -> 25322.70s]  Mario sunshine, but I haven't really played very many Nintendo games all the way through.
[25322.70s -> 25331.82s]  What's the last Nintendo game I really played? Did I, I beat, did I beat Pikmin? Did I complete
[25331.82s -> 25352.42s]  Pikmin? No, I don't think I did. Right. I got the first ending. Oh, well I got like the, yeah,
[25352.42s -> 25362.73s]  the ending, like the first part of the game. I saw an ending. Oh, that game was terrible by the way.
[25363.53s -> 25370.04s]  I was, I was holding in so much, how much I hated that whole game. I wanted to scream so badly about
[25370.04s -> 25376.86s]  how much I just despised playing it. I just held it in though. It's been a lot, enough times
[25376.86s -> 25401.40s]  gone by. I can tell you. I'm kidding. Jesus. I'm kidding. Oh my God. I'm kidding. Don't worry.
[25401.96s -> 25434.18s]  Oh, there's a lot of dirt still. 40% and everyone back to Hades. That was the game. That was my
[25434.18s -> 25444.81s]  game of the year too. Yeah, actual game of the year. And I only played, I played like, I played
[25444.81s -> 25452.86s]  it for like seven and a half hours. Hey, look, I know exactly how good it is. I don't need to
[25452.86s -> 25484.55s]  know anymore. Was it in Half-Life Alyx? Oh yeah, it was. That game was awesome. Half-Life Alyx was
[25484.55s -> 25509.27s]  so good. It was truly a fantastic game. I underrated it? I did? Didn't I say it was the game of the
[25509.27s -> 25540.09s]  year? What'd I give it for a rating? 9.4? That's pretty good. Going higher than a 9.4. I mean,
[25540.09s -> 25550.60s]  that's one of the most, that's one of the best games I've ever played. Having, having to score
[25550.60s -> 25557.32s]  over a 9 means that's one of the best games I've played. What else have I given a 9 in the last
[25557.32s -> 25593.86s]  five years? Minecraft? Makes sense. Minecraft makes sense. House Flipper? That makes sense too.
[25600.23s -> 25615.43s]  What game is a 10 out of 10? I don't know. GTA 4 is probably pretty high. Resident Evil 2 was
[25615.43s -> 25641.94s]  really high, the remake. TF2 would be pretty close as well. Yeah, I don't know though. Bloodborne?
[25641.94s -> 25658.71s]  Bloodborne needs to be 60 FPS. That's the one thing holding it back. I'm not sure I've ever
[25658.71s -> 25672.39s]  played a perfect 10 out of 10. Team Fortress is close. It probably is TF2. I can't think of much
[25672.39s -> 25695.98s]  else that deserves a 10. Chrono Trigger? Yeah, Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, those are all really good.
[25696.54s -> 25727.45s]  They're all at least 9.5. Is this side over here? And I'm probably going to call it sooner than I
[25727.45s -> 25732.17s]  think. I might not even finish this one. I'm really hungry. I keep thinking of cheesy goudita crunches
[25732.17s -> 25750.54s]  and I want one right now and I want to go eat one. Diablo or WoW Classic? Diablo 2. That's not an
[25750.54s -> 25773.96s]  easy one to answer though. I still think Diablo 2 beats it. My god. Get up there. Diablo 2 is just,
[25775.83s -> 25782.30s]  you don't get better than that. I think Diablo 2 is a 10. Well, Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction.
[25782.30s -> 25801.10s]  That game was so good. Am I going to play the Diablo 2 remake? I mean, probably. I don't know
[25801.10s -> 25805.62s]  if I'm going to stream that though. I'm not sure that, I think that's something that I want to do
[25805.62s -> 25815.54s]  in my own time if I'm going to do it. And then whenever Elden Ring decides to come out, yeah.
[25816.18s -> 25832.71s]  Elaborate? Um, I don't know. I kind of would just want to play D2 on my own.
[25834.65s -> 25850.62s]  Just sit there with my mouth open. That's my McDonald's order. That's uh, it really depends
[25850.62s -> 25858.73s]  on the day, but usually it's uh, it's right now. I'd say it's two McChickens, two McDoubles,
[25861.18s -> 25890.52s]  and a Big Mac, and a five and a six piece nugget, and two cherry pies. Window frame is so
[25891.16s -> 25910.66s]  finicky. There it is. Very good boy. You're a liar. Now it's two McChickens and two McDoubles,
[25910.66s -> 25929.53s]  and then if I'm really, really hungry, I'll get nuggets. Like a six piece. That's not obscene.
[25929.53s -> 25936.52s]  They're not even that big. A McDonald's patty is like two ounces. What's a McDonald's burger patty?
[25937.08s -> 25951.72s]  It's two and a half ounces. It's three ounces, isn't it? It's like a two or three ounce patty.
[25952.28s -> 25959.75s]  You know, there are people that make four, six, five, six, seven ounce patties. It's not a joke.
[25959.75s -> 25972.81s]  What even is a joke? I hate big patties. I think they're gross. If your patty is bigger than your
[25972.81s -> 25986.78s]  bun, you got a problem. There's a problem there. The ratio of meat to bun has to be different.
[25987.34s -> 25995.40s]  Has to be enough where you get, I would say, meat to bun ratio. Like uh, the meat should be
[25996.28s -> 26022.14s]  half as big as the bun. Maybe even a little less. In terms of volume or mass. Um, like thickness.
[26022.94s -> 26026.78s]  Your bun should never be thicker. Uh, you know, your bun should never be the same thickness as
[26026.78s -> 26047.21s]  your meat. Because then all the condiments have to go on. All your lettuce, your, you know, if you
[26047.21s -> 26052.01s]  have tomato, I mean, that's disgusting, but if you put it on there, good for you. You've got your
[26052.01s -> 26056.33s]  cheese. You've got your onion potentially. You've got your chopped onion. Not, not whole onion
[26057.69s -> 26089.03s]  circles. No, thank you. Etch up, mustard, pickles, whatever. That one felt good. You don't like
[26089.03s -> 26094.46s]  tomato? No, I don't, I don't like cold, wet tomato on my hamburger. I like tomato. I just
[26094.46s -> 26099.98s]  don't like it on a hamburger. I don't think it belongs there. All right. The house is clean.
[26099.98s -> 26110.55s]  All right. I'm probably going to call it here. Just don't look at the side of the house. I need
[26110.55s -> 26121.66s]  to go get a, I need to get some food. I'm hungry. I'm going to get to, I got to 50%. Once it's 50%,
[26121.66s -> 26127.14s]  I'll leave. But thanks for watching everybody. This has been Power Washer Simulator. It's very
[26127.14s -> 26130.98s]  good. It's very relaxing. It's very fun. I'm surprised I sat here for seven hours and 15
[26130.98s -> 26139.61s]  minutes. It was a lot of fun. Had a good time. I'll see you guys next week for E3. I'm going to do
[26139.61s -> 26155.75s]  at least the Microsoft conference. We'll see you after that. We'll see you soon. It is my 10 year
[26155.75s -> 26161.51s]  anniversary online on YouTube and Twitch and everything. That's happening I believe on Thursday.
[26161.51s -> 26169.98s]  I'm not, I'm probably not going to go live for it. We'll talk about it at E3. But in case I miss
[26169.98s -> 26181.08s]  you, it's been 10 years officially as of this week. It's been a wild ride. It's been fun.
[26183.37s -> 26190.25s]  We'll talk about it some more this next weekend. Not my birthday yet. All right. Yeah. I'm going
[26190.25s -> 26197.50s]  to call it here. I need some food. I will see you guys on whenever the Microsoft conference is.
[26197.50s -> 26203.70s]  Have a great rest of your week. It's very, very soon here. I'll have a lot more to talk about.
[26204.42s -> 26213.43s]  There's another few projects that are coming up that are going to be in September, August.
[26214.07s -> 26218.97s]  Talked about baseball. Baseball is confirmed. It's a go. It's happening.
[26218.97s -> 26226.98s]  There's a lot of things happening. I hope you think they're interesting. But I'll see you soon.
[26226.98s -> 26237.11s]  Let's transition out of here. Show the credits. Yeah, the baseball stream is confirmed to be
[26237.11s -> 26241.91s]  happening at some point in September. There's another big stream that's happening in August,
[26241.91s -> 26252.04s]  which I'll talk about more later, among a couple other small things. Don't forget about Mizkif.
[26252.04s -> 26269.24s]  Yeah, I'll hit him up. I'll see what the deal is. That might be fun too. When is your Among Us
[26269.24s -> 26276.44s]  stream? Never going to play Among Us. How late to the meme do you guys really want me to be?
[26281.61s -> 26299.03s]  You really want me to be that late to the meme? Two years too late. Yeah, I'm getting Taco Bell.
[26299.03s -> 26312.42s]  I'm into it. Let's do it. Play it the day the servers go down. We'll find that out. We'll find
[26312.42s -> 26317.93s]  the day the servers turn off, and I'll play it on that day. I don't think that's going to happen.
[26325.46s -> 26334.28s]  I really doubt that'll happen. It's still really popular. I think it's a lot more popular than
[26334.28s -> 26353.98s]  you guys are giving it credit for still. Raid Mizkif? All right, we're going to raid Mizkif.
[26353.98s -> 26366.78s]  I mean, we've been talking about him all stream. We might as well go do it. I've been talking about
[26366.78s -> 26375.27s]  him all stream. It's been like seven hours of us talking about him. Go say hello. What is he doing?
[26375.27s -> 26400.57s]  What is he up to? He's doing something. Raid yourself. Go say hi. Look, we've got to at least
[26400.57s -> 26409.83s]  make a... If I'm going to go on that game show thing, whatever it is, schooled, and here's
[26409.83s -> 26415.82s]  an introduction, I guess. I don't know. He's doing something fun. I'll see you guys soon. We'll see
[26415.82s -> 26429.02s]  you next week. Take care of yourselves. Go say hello. Network Andy. Network Andy's back.
[26430.30s -> 26486.54s]  He's back with a vengeance. Take care, guys. See you soon.
