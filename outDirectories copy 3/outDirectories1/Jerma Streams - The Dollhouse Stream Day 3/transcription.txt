[520.70s -> 525.98s]  Hey, whoa, daba, atibatabo, ho ho.
[580.52s -> 630.06s]  That's our family, let's see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[864.60s -> 1091.06s]  Yep, these, what are we gonna do, what do you say like with the lip I was just doing, I'm just going.
[1127.75s -> 1354.22s]  Just a little too big, can't breathe without these, what are we gonna do, say like with the lip I was
[1354.22s -> 1355.02s]  just doing, I'm just going.
[1391.64s -> 1392.76s]  Just a little too big.
[1681.70s -> 1703.93s]  Welcome to the stream, everybody. Welcome to the stream, everybody, it's me, Jeremy985 here.
[1704.49s -> 1710.17s]  Just getting to my house that was just recently fixed and upgraded, hopefully.
[1720.94s -> 1723.67s]  If I put too much pressure on it, it just, ow.
[1730.68s -> 1731.64s]  How's everybody doing?
[1733.16s -> 1738.04s]  Hopefully everybody's okay, hope everybody's feeling okay, hope everybody's doing okay.
[1739.40s -> 1746.30s]  I am not doing okay, this is probably the worst I've ever felt since,
[1747.56s -> 1751.00s]  I don't know, I don't have an oberometer for this because this is the worst ever.
[1753.16s -> 1768.81s]  Oh yeah, let's, what do we got up here, what's this, wait, wait, I got trapped in the wall,
[1769.53s -> 1774.01s]  I got trapped in the wall, I got stuck in the wall,
[1775.13s -> 1782.90s]  I can't, there it is, okay, I got stuck back there, I got stuck in the wall.
[1786.28s -> 1795.30s]  What is this? Ooh, I didn't know about this, this looks like a staircase.
[1797.08s -> 1809.05s]  Oh this is, I really like what they did here, ooh, second floor, wow, interesting stuff.
[1811.26s -> 1816.07s]  I didn't finish this one, this one wasn't finished, I was gonna hopefully do some of that
[1816.07s -> 1821.75s]  today, some work, but I don't feel like doing any work right now.
[1824.34s -> 1826.58s]  They told me that I could finish it however I wanted.
[1830.97s -> 1840.97s]  What else is up here? Oh yes, the stuff I bought, bed, another bedroom,
[1842.31s -> 1856.95s]  oh, this one gives me less comfort than this one, I look like Clark Kent, but if he was smaller,
[1857.83s -> 1866.30s]  didn't go to law school and never went to the gym, I look like fucking Otacon.
[1869.48s -> 1873.64s]  Yes, Snake, what you need to do is, but I'm not smart enough to be that guy,
[1874.44s -> 1884.30s]  I like this bedroom though, yay, ow, so if you guys knew that weren't here yesterday,
[1885.26s -> 1890.86s]  uh, the old house got kind of burnt and we got some insurance money which was immediately used
[1890.86s -> 1901.98s]  to fix the damage and to upgrade the home. So now we have two floors, we've got a DIY room
[1902.94s -> 1910.18s]  and we've got all the other rooms that you've seen already, thank you, oh my god. Now the
[1910.18s -> 1916.34s]  thing about these stairs is they go down pretty far, this is a very high, this is a very far house,
[1917.30s -> 1924.20s]  so it takes a few minutes to get down the stairs, takes about 10 seconds, a very big house,
[1925.00s -> 1935.32s]  that was just huge, that's not the bathroom, that's not the bathroom, I went to the wrong door,
[1935.32s -> 1947.13s]  that's the wrong door, I gotta go to the bathroom real bad, thank you,
[1954.49s -> 1956.25s]  get out of here, I don't even want to use it,
[1956.25s -> 1977.86s]  I don't think I've washed my hands in a week and a half, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, okay, is it healed yet?
[1978.82s -> 1994.36s]  Let's find out, I feel better, can I get this off too? Oh shit, this is clipped on,
[1996.30s -> 2003.18s]  this is clipped onto my body, it's gonna stay, they just have bird shit on me, oh thanks seagull,
[2004.38s -> 2013.40s]  oh, and by the way, I know you like the robe, I know you do, but, but I, it's too hot up here to
[2013.40s -> 2018.76s]  wear this 24 seven, I'll put it on at other times, okay, they really have a huge bird shit on me,
[2023.96s -> 2030.04s]  can I put this somewhere, it's way too hot to wear this, do you know how hot it is,
[2030.92s -> 2037.74s]  I can't put this on, and by the way, these don't fit, I was so concerned that these were gonna
[2037.74s -> 2043.10s]  get picked, because they don't fit, it was, it's a disaster, so I'm gonna be walking around like
[2043.10s -> 2053.08s]  this is a diaper, what do you mean, wear the robe or no food, wear the robe, I can't see that today
[2053.08s -> 2064.31s]  to take my glasses off, no robe, no food, fine, what did you hear, here's a souvenir,
[2067.06s -> 2072.66s]  all right, I'll put the robe back on, but if there's like an article written later this afternoon
[2072.66s -> 2077.30s]  about like streamer dies of heatstroke on stream, remember whose fault it was,
[2081.69s -> 2098.74s]  I guess I'll have a cookie, fresh baked cookies, fresh baked cookies from eight days ago,
[2099.70s -> 2117.53s]  pretty good, it's not even good, you're like, this is like dad, you have like a sleepover,

[2148.71s -> 2156.73s]  that was a good cookie, I love how cookie equals entire meal, one thing I had to make really clear
[2157.29s -> 2164.68s]  is eating on this stream, eating on stream, right, I can't eat like a full dinner every day,
[2165.56s -> 2168.84s]  I can't, what you want me to eat like a full plate of steak or something, no, I'm gonna eat
[2168.84s -> 2176.42s]  a cookie and I'm good, and I'm like, I have to finish the cookie, right, I can't just throw
[2176.42s -> 2204.78s]  like a quarter of a cookie away, give me a shower, oh wait, wait, let's go for a shower,
[2207.64s -> 2216.39s]  with my glasses on, hey, hey, I'll ask Reddit, what's something you do in the shower that like
[2216.39s -> 2220.39s]  people know and it's like we all know, oh man, I go in the shower with my glasses on all the time
[2220.39s -> 2238.95s]  and they fog up, oh me too, 10,000 upvotes, oh, oh, you know, I don't think there'll ever be one

[2244.84s -> 2254.73s]  this is the third one, this is day three, but like look, if you get, whatever,
[2255.77s -> 2257.77s]  how do I even describe, explain myself here,
[2266.06s -> 2283.62s]  at least I feel clean, oh, I need to go, I want to go to my bed, I want to go in my bed,
[2291.22s -> 2298.04s]  oh these stairs, I don't even want stairs, I wanted a flat house where I could walk around it,
[2301.43s -> 2312.71s]  oh, this is going to be fun, but I don't want to do it, what's that, what's that,
[2313.61s -> 2322.84s]  I said jorba.net 5.com, jorba.net 5.com official merchandise, don't go and don't, don't go,
[2322.84s -> 2332.25s]  let me see if there's any butterflies, let me see if there's any butterflies,

[2342.84s -> 2351.34s]  wow, this looks like I'm trapped in here, like hey, excuse me, I'm locked in here,
[2351.34s -> 2358.79s]  can somebody help me, can you catch me a butterfly, I have to go outside,
[2359.43s -> 2368.30s]  I'm too tired, I can't catch butterflies, I just got my robe got stuck,
[2369.59s -> 2375.56s]  all right, I'll go catch butterflies, sleep would have been a great option,
[2376.12s -> 2388.07s]  you know, go to sleep, but fine, I'll go in and catch a few butterflies, like I care, whatever,
[2388.55s -> 2406.18s]  I can make it, I can make it, I think I can make it, but no, of course not, I didn't even show you
[2406.18s -> 2409.14s]  outside, I didn't even show you, but we can look at something else too, we can look at the pool,
[2410.02s -> 2423.94s]  I have a pool now, I almost fell over, I had to just ground myself for a second,
[2423.94s -> 2436.01s]  ground myself for a second, otherwise I would have puked, we got a pool, and oh cool, oh yay,
[2436.01s -> 2451.03s]  ow, arm, oh butterflies, oh my god, this is a huge net for a butterfly, what are we catching, mothra,

[2504.04s -> 2514.79s]  I gotta get to bed right now, I'm so tired, just I need one night's sleep of good rest in a bed,
[2515.67s -> 2533.98s]  that's all I need, that's all I want, oh the bed is calling me, it's screaming at me,
[2542.58s -> 2941.70s]  I feel great, what a good night's sleep, holy smokes, oh man, I feel like I could write a book,
[2941.70s -> 2944.34s]  I feel like I could write a play, I feel like I could write a novel, I feel like I could go
[2944.34s -> 2949.14s]  for a jog, oh I feel fucking incredible, damn what a good night's sleep can do for you,
[2949.78s -> 2961.50s]  and a good food, all that good stuff, it's coming off, it's clipped into the microphone,
[2962.74s -> 2970.09s]  at some point we're gonna have to actually do something about this, oh I feel good though,
[2970.73s -> 2981.27s]  what a day, oh projects, mystery box, what's in here, why is there a mystery box up here,
[2981.27s -> 2991.21s]  sounds like a pretty good day to check the mail, I got up a little too fast and I almost just burped,
[2994.07s -> 2999.51s]  I created a bunch of gas when I just came up really quickly, and uh yeah, I almost just
[2999.51s -> 3014.17s]  burped on camera, let's check the mail, I feel so good, I could probably even come out backwards,
[3016.30s -> 3020.66s]  I can, why don't we do it here too, I bet you I can come out backwards,
[3033.45s -> 3045.88s]  that's new, whatever it is, there's a piece of mail in here, well this,
[3045.88s -> 3055.02s]  it's probably one of these kids in the neighborhood, what does it say, it says,
[3055.02s -> 3059.74s]  Jerma, thank you for involving us in such a unique experience, we have had the time of our lives,
[3060.70s -> 3068.30s]  the crew, they actually wrote that, they actually wrote that, that's actually really nice,
[3069.10s -> 3074.54s]  without a crew like this, this is not possible, this is by far one of the coolest things I've
[3074.54s -> 3078.78s]  ever done, and by far some of the best people I've ever worked with in my whole life, and I
[3078.78s -> 3084.36s]  really mean that, all of you, there's tons of people back here, tons of people backstage,
[3084.44s -> 3089.06s]  you can't even see them, but uh, but clean this shit up,
[3094.65s -> 3112.71s]  oh a unicorn, wow, oh it's huge, oh dude, stone cold, oh stunner, don't hurt him, don't hurt him,
[3112.71s -> 3121.86s]  I'm not, he's fine, cool, I can't wait to potentially go swimming in that pool with
[3122.34s -> 3126.98s]  absolute water in it, you know, fun fact for those of you behind the scenes stuff,
[3126.98s -> 3131.38s]  there's supposed to be water in there, it's supposed to be a full pool, but last minute we
[3131.38s -> 3138.90s]  decided, what an absolute dangerous hazard considering there is a transformer right there,
[3148.70s -> 3160.14s]  all right, I love it though, I do feel good though, this is a good day,
[3160.14s -> 3180.06s]  hey, go to work, you got it, I'm in such a good mood, oh hey, can you cue up, can you cue up
[3180.06s -> 3185.30s]  like if somebody gets like fucking speared sound, can you cue up like if somebody gets like shing,
[3185.30s -> 3192.44s]  like speared sound, could you get that like right now, okay, I want like a skewed up
[3192.44s -> 3198.97s]  spear sound, somebody gets hit with a spear and they get like ah, I know, I, hold on, I'll be
[3198.97s -> 3440.46s]  right there, hey, hey, hey, thanks a lot to the crew, I'm coming, thank you, eventually I will
[3440.46s -> 3458.39s]  get a car, I promise, one day, I don't know when, thanks for the ride, oh shit, I hit somebody,
[3458.39s -> 3464.52s]  oh my god, I actually hit somebody with the fucking javelin, are you all right, I mean I
[3464.52s -> 3470.81s]  threw it as hard as I could, I didn't know you're gonna be that far away, is he all right, is he
[3470.81s -> 3476.54s]  okay, somebody, it's, I see a lot of blood coming out of here, it's like, it's profusely,
[3476.54s -> 3483.82s]  what was the medical on him, are you sure we can, is it all right, is he okay, okay, I mean why would
[3483.82s -> 3490.57s]  you stand in the way, I mean I knew I had a good arm, but I mean, you know what, but I'm cheating,
[3490.57s -> 3498.98s]  you know what I mean, that's a classic fucking comedy joke, all right, that was a good day of
[3498.98s -> 3509.03s]  work, I am kind of gross, I mean look, I've got a pool back here, I don't even need your choice,
[3509.03s -> 3517.62s]  I want to go in the pool, look, we got it out here, I'm gonna use it, it's been a long day at work,
[3518.26s -> 3524.82s]  I'm gonna get in the pool, just turn it off, otherwise I fucking won't stop touching it,
[3528.97s -> 3538.78s]  okay, I could wear my, I could wear the same clothes, it doesn't matter, a little cold, cold,
[3538.78s -> 3550.98s]  what's the thing, you just gotta go right in, okay, I'm just going in, that feels good,
[3551.30s -> 3581.18s]  ah, oh, butyl berry do one of these, I think so, ah, right there, that feels good, oh, you know,
[3581.18s -> 3586.06s]  something about cold water, that just really gets into your, gets into your head, it opens up your
[3586.06s -> 3590.62s]  blood vessels, or closes them, I don't know, either one of those two things, it does one of them,
[3598.42s -> 3637.74s]  all right, what happened, you feel like I was still alive, but something happened there,
[3637.82s -> 3647.45s]  I feel like, that was a long day at work, that was really weird, I kind of like just,
[3648.33s -> 3653.21s]  it felt like I stopped, my head, it was like a split second, my head felt like it was,
[3655.75s -> 3662.87s]  like my head froze, but it was only like for a second, I don't know, but where's the ladder,
[3665.56s -> 3671.64s]  what, I'm actually having fun though, I'm having a fun time, what happened to the ladder,
[3674.06s -> 3686.23s]  where's the, where's the ladder, um, where's the ladder, I have to get out of the pool,
[3688.14s -> 3695.58s]  I don't want to be in here all day, I've got shit to do, help, somebody help me, somebody help me,
[3699.29s -> 3703.91s]  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come back, come back, help, help, help, help, help, get in the pool,

[3708.95s -> 3714.23s]  get in the pool, there's someone in the pool that needs help, there's, I think they took the
[3714.23s -> 3723.43s]  ladder over there, fucking idiot, AI piece of shit, hey, hey, don't eat anything,
[3730.58s -> 3734.46s]  don't eat anything, what's he doing, is he going, is he in my bathroom,
[3736.49s -> 3741.21s]  no, still drinking beer, I can tell, that's all people do in my house is drink beer out of the
[3741.21s -> 3746.02s]  fridge, put the ladder back, put the ladder back, you can put the ladder back if you want,
[3747.34s -> 3755.58s]  you should put the ladder back, I want to get out of the pool, I want to get out of the pool,
[3755.58s -> 3772.36s]  I want to get out of the pool, put the ladder back,
[3799.29s -> 3808.60s]  well, well, has someone gone for a little swim without his floaties,

[3825.05s -> 3834.57s]  oh, yes, it's time for the midnight train to the long farewell, no, no, what,
[3835.85s -> 3841.93s]  you killed me, why did you take the ladder out, that's a, it's a funny joke, isn't it,
[3841.93s -> 3847.85s]  until it's dead, are you blaming someone else when you decided to get in without a life jacket,
[3848.01s -> 3858.90s]  oh, you're right, calm down, okay, am I dead, am I dead now, oh, you're very, very dead,
[3858.90s -> 3869.77s]  oh, wait a minute, I could have just gone like this, oh, unfortunately, no gives these backsies,

[3887.85s -> 3894.57s]  the way, the mysterious, the dark, mysterious stranger, you know, usually when people flirt
[3894.57s -> 3900.89s]  with death, it's something simpler like blowfish sushi, right, this is a bit complicated, are you,
[3901.93s -> 3905.69s]  do you mean it when you say that, or are you saying that because you saw me,
[3906.33s -> 3911.53s]  I mean, I mean it, I do, I think that I, would you like to come inside, maybe,
[3912.41s -> 3916.09s]  do we have to go immediately, or can we have a drink, can we hang out, you know,
[3916.09s -> 3921.21s]  this is kind of, listen, I have a hot dog eating contest, and I've got three souls to take in about
[3921.21s -> 3929.13s]  20 minutes, okay, it's unconventional, but this once, I'll allow it, okay, great, come on in,
[3930.01s -> 3933.37s]  I feel, is that normal, should I be doing that, that is normal,

[3944.87s -> 3951.59s]  that's all right, time to see your uncle Ted, isn't that fun, after all, I didn't even know
[3951.59s -> 3958.71s]  that, I thought he was dead, like, I've already got a spot picked out for you, okay, well, I do,
[3958.71s -> 3964.79s]  I really do think you're a very, very, very handsome death, oh, stop, stop, you don't mean

[5441.98s -> 5448.94s]  of my phone calls, we sent you a bunch of things in the mail, a couple emails, a couple fax machines,
[5448.94s -> 5454.14s]  even got your grandma in on the thing, but for some reason you just don't seem to want to get
[5454.14s -> 5462.30s]  back to me about your vehicle's extended warranty, are you trying to drive on safety, do you want
[5462.30s -> 5468.22s]  your car to explode, at this point I'm starting to, I'm starting to be a little concerned,

[5695.29s -> 5699.29s]  fashion trend right now, right, is it like a dress that people wear that looks like this,
[5700.60s -> 5705.27s]  with like a halter top and it's like this, right, don't you think that'd be huge,
[5705.83s -> 5713.19s]  and it goes into a dress, I think I found, look, if you're a designer and you make this,
[5713.99s -> 5723.91s]  I want 10%, it goes around all the way back, yeah, all right, food, making food is just annoying and

[5747.58s -> 5769.72s]  I'm not dealing with this shit until I eat, we're here on behalf of the king, on what king,
[5770.92s -> 5776.10s]  King Elton McCartney, the conqueror of the fifth, as you are new to these lands,
[5777.14s -> 5785.30s]  you must read the scroll, I need to read the scroll, do we expect you to pledge fealty
[5785.30s -> 5790.74s]  to the king, if not there will be dire consequences, I don't know what drugs are
[5790.74s -> 5796.82s]  going around this neighborhood, but it's something hard, pledges fealty, or you'll be severed,
[5797.62s -> 5801.70s]  so you're gonna, you're gonna kill me if I don't pledge fealty, what's fealty, pledge fealty to
[5801.70s -> 5813.51s]  the king for 500 shillings, 500 shillings, is that money, the youngest king Agatha,

[5827.10s -> 5830.62s]  a joke or something, no I'm here on behalf of the king, and the thing is if you don't pay,
[5830.62s -> 5833.58s]  I gotta sever your head, I don't know if you ever used one of these, it's kind of dull, it takes a
[5833.58s -> 5836.94s]  little bit of time, that hurt actually, I've done three today, I'm fucking tired bro, just pay me
[5836.94s -> 5841.18s]  like 500 shillings, that's like, you know, 20, 21, 200 bucks, you look like shit, you're not even that big,

[5845.98s -> 5849.66s]  got a torn rotator cuff, I know, but you look like shit, and I fucking, I could probably beat you up,
[5849.66s -> 5853.82s]  I could probably punch you in the face and kill you, loser, loser, that poked me in the eye,
[5854.70s -> 5858.14s]  you're most really gonna do this, can you just cut me a fucking, how much money do you need?

[5863.80s -> 5872.94s]  it's not your concern, are you gonna pay or not, look, if you want 500 bucks from me,
[5873.82s -> 5876.70s]  then I'm gonna have to hear a goddamn song from this motherfucker right here,
[5877.90s -> 5888.18s]  you want 500, you're not in a position to decide if, who play it, the flute if, I want to hear a
[5888.18s -> 5899.98s]  song, don't it end everybody else, my music sucks, you both suck, you're both idiots,
[5901.02s -> 5904.46s]  you both, you both, you both like probably, you probably both stupid, you probably fucking have a

[5985.46s -> 5995.34s]  that's his thing that he does, hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast,
[5996.06s -> 6006.81s]  ah, yeah, yeah, I know a guy that can drink beer real fast, this thing is gross, I'm putting this
[6006.81s -> 6012.25s]  in the sink, and you left my door open, pledge fealty to the king, well I hope your daughter got

[6028.12s -> 6032.49s]  one in this whole neighborhood, well that's not actually accurate because I've had like three of
[6032.49s -> 6042.38s]  those, can I get the bread off the ground at least, what is the king doing here, why is there like a

[6090.70s -> 6094.14s]  okay, I gotta make sure, look, I just got it installed the other day,
[6096.07s -> 6102.82s]  all right, what's on TV, let's get ourselves on, that's a lot of feedback from a microphone,

[6127.67s -> 6136.17s]  to get my service, it costs $2,000 per cleaning, or $2,500 if you want me to wear cat ears,
[6136.17s -> 6142.01s]  or $150 if you're a giant piece of shit named Jerma, change the channel, change the channel,
[6142.01s -> 6144.97s]  I don't want to say that, change the channel, what's this?
[6145.61s -> 6161.90s]  Now future recent events will also be roaming the neighbourhoods and helping out those who are in need,
[6161.90s -> 6166.78s]  when we replace homes, because we've heard there's been a lot of un-things happening,
[6166.78s -> 6172.38s]  fires and drowning, well then there's this main incident, everything that could just be-
[6172.38s -> 6174.86s]  Change the channel, change the channel, change the channel, change the channel,
[6174.86s -> 6180.06s]  giant piece of shit, he's a big poopy, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him,

[6233.46s -> 6248.66s]  He's screaming, he's screaming, man TV is weird out here,
[6249.54s -> 6255.38s]  there seems to be only two or three stations, it must be an antenna, I- what happened to this?
[6258.06s -> 6266.82s]  What is that? There's three channels on that TV, I don't even want to pick it up, and I'm not
[6266.82s -> 6276.70s]  touching that because there's poopoo on it, oh my god there's like beer everywhere, this is actually
[6276.70s -> 6288.33s]  kind of a disaster, this is gonna get actually cleaned, oh interesting, here's the beer stein,
[6288.33s -> 6305.91s]  whatever you want to call this, let's rinse it out, yuck, disgusting, I'm going up into the bed,
[6305.91s -> 6314.39s]  I want to sit down, there's just a soda, there's a non-descript soda over there,
[6316.86s -> 6323.98s]  I want to check out the DIY room, because what does that mean? DIY room, do it yourself, DIY,
[6328.62s -> 6340.46s]  I don't want to stream right now, I've got a lot going on, how am I gonna stream on Twitch?
[6341.67s -> 6352.18s]  Um okay, where's the mouse and keyboard, where's the key, okay there's the mouse,
[6353.43s -> 6364.44s]  am I still banned on Twitch? I don't think so, all right starting the stream, I gotta apologize to
[6364.44s -> 6369.35s]  everybody, let me go live, it's been like three, it's been like four or five days since I was,
[6369.35s -> 6377.18s]  I got banned like twice, let me, I gotta apologize, make sure I look okay, I have to look like,
[6377.18s -> 6384.10s]  I gotta look hot in this video right, because that's what matters, not the apology,
[6384.66s -> 6403.06s]  I gotta make sure I look good, okay let's go live, and live, hey what's up everybody,
[6403.86s -> 6410.65s]  Jerma985 here, I know for the last couple of weeks I've been live um only a few times,
[6411.37s -> 6434.15s]  and it's been for only like two or three minutes, and then I go BRB, I'll be right back, hey everybody
[6434.15s -> 6438.47s]  it's Jerma985 here, I just want to get some good comfortable clothes for this stream,
[6439.43s -> 6443.59s]  because you know it's important stuff we're talking about here, I have to apologize real quick
[6445.37s -> 6451.61s]  that I've been I've been I've been away, and I've been not good to you, and you may have seen some
[6451.61s -> 6455.37s]  things on the stream, me sleeping, you may have seen me shitting on stream a few times and going
[6455.37s -> 6459.37s]  to the bathroom on stream, but I want to say I don't condone going to the bathroom on stream,
[6459.37s -> 6464.17s]  I find it disgusting and repulsive, and that I find that anybody that would do that would be
[6464.17s -> 6469.69s]  completely out of their mind, I don't condone it, and it's not me, it's me from a while ago,
[6469.69s -> 6473.93s]  it's a past me, I just want to say that I'm sorry about my past me that would have actually gone to
[6473.93s -> 6478.65s]  the bathroom on stream, and that would have gone BRB and gone to sleep, that's not me,
[6479.85s -> 6485.75s]  that's not me, I would I mean that's not me as of a week ago, that's not me, I'm a new person,
[6485.75s -> 6489.51s]  I mean it was a week ago, it was a week ago, but it's not me, that's not who I am,
[6490.47s -> 6496.79s]  I also want to say very very much sorry to Al Migraine, to Amelia, what? I want to say sorry
[6496.79s -> 6502.15s]  to Amelia, because they didn't deserve that kind of treatment, and I really feel like that they the
[6502.23s -> 6508.95s]  that I really just want to say sorry to them, they saw me having sex with death in my bed,
[6509.59s -> 6514.55s]  and I just want to say that that's not me, that's not me, that's not who I am, I don't have sex
[6514.55s -> 6518.31s]  with like three different people and like lie to everybody as of a week ago, it was three days ago,
[6518.31s -> 6524.95s]  but that's not me, I'm not that's not who I am, I woohooed him, we can't say that word,
[6525.91s -> 6537.22s]  or can we? I woohooed, woohooed, it's not the same, it's not the same thing chat,
[6537.22s -> 6542.82s]  woohoo is a different term, although I just really screwed up and said something else,
[6542.82s -> 6548.18s]  woohoo is different, it's different, we woohooed, we both said woohoo, we had a great time,
[6548.18s -> 6552.26s]  and look I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm apologizing for that, let me apologize for the apology too,
[6552.26s -> 6556.18s]  I'm very sorry about that apology, how I said something else that wasn't what we did,
[6556.26s -> 6560.66s]  we were upstairs, we rolled around, we went oh woohoo, and that's it, that's all that happened,
[6560.66s -> 6950.73s]  that's, so I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for apologizing for the apology, this time I mean it,
[6951.85s -> 6957.37s]  I know you might, some of you might think I'm like a shitty person, but I don't care, you paid me a
[6957.37s -> 6962.01s]  lot of money, so I don't care, but like you know, I'm just gonna do this to make sure everybody's
[6962.01s -> 6970.89s]  happy about it, I'm sure everybody's happy about that, I'm sorry that I said the S word,
[6971.53s -> 6977.05s]  the S word, S-E-I, I can't even say it, oh it's not me, sorry I'm not that person,
[6977.05s -> 6980.33s]  S-E-I, oh I can't say it, you know what I mean, like that's not me from yesterday,
[6981.53s -> 6984.89s]  from when I went to sleep that time, I can't even say that word, oh I can't even say it anymore,
[6984.89s -> 6993.85s]  it's disgusting to me, but yeah I'm really sorry about that, and what, I've been permanently banned
[6993.85s -> 7005.98s]  from Twitch, permanently, indefinitely, but indefinite means like, no, I'll just record
[7005.98s -> 7015.66s]  an apology video and then I'll send it to Twitch, I gotta record an apology video, hey get the OBS

[7024.94s -> 7029.74s]  Twitch, please appeal the ban in front of a toilet, pink is, pink background's fine,
[7030.38s -> 7036.84s]  hey Twitch, it's me Jerma here, I just wanted to appeal the ban that I had,
[7039.34s -> 7051.58s]  I was on a lot of drugs and I didn't mean any of those things, no, delete that, here we go, hey,
[7052.54s -> 7059.40s]  delete it again, start over, hey Twitch, it's me Jerma985 here, just want to make sure I check
[7059.40s -> 7064.04s]  in with you and see that I got a permanent, indefinite kind of ban, what you saw the last
[7064.04s -> 7069.16s]  few days, it's been kind of crazy, a gladiator came in and was like threatening to kill me,
[7069.16s -> 7075.59s]  and I'm gonna start over again, again, one more time, make sure it looks taller and bigger because
[7075.59s -> 7086.62s]  the minion will be able to present and get the robe off too, hey Twitch, it's me Jerma985 here,
[7086.62s -> 7090.70s]  just wanted to give you a quick update of what happened over the last few days and appeal the
[7090.70s -> 7099.72s]  ban, I was attacked by a bear a couple times, I don't care, whatever, fuck it, I'm banned forever,
[7099.72s -> 7136.09s]  don't care, whatever idea, Twitch I got hacked and somebody posted on my behalf and it wasn't
[7136.09s -> 7143.86s]  even me, so I'm sorry about it, send that email, send, send, I'm gonna take a shower,
[7155.29s -> 7162.28s]  what am I gonna do about money, what am I gonna do, why is the water not working, fuck,
[7163.24s -> 7173.94s]  how am I gonna get paid, oh, what am I supposed to do, I brush my teeth in the shower
[7173.94s -> 7184.86s]  every day, that was a quick shower, what was that, you know the move, you know the move,
[7202.76s -> 7222.71s]  my arm still hurts from the window, from Twitch, it's not even funny, it's not even funny,
[7223.43s -> 7261.02s]  I want to watch TV, that sounds like a plan to me,
[7264.15s -> 7276.17s]  what's on TV today, journal on, and good afternoon residents of dollhouse, we have an emergency
[7276.17s -> 7280.73s]  announcement, there has been a gorilla reported on the loose, after speaking with the gorilla,
[7280.73s -> 7286.81s]  we did get some information by the motive of his escape, after dispute with his mother about not
[7286.81s -> 7294.65s]  liking his girlfriend, he has decided to escape his enclosure, here we have Randy, our specialist
[7294.65s -> 7299.69s]  in the area on gorillas and bears, Randy do you have any advice to offer citizens if they
[7299.69s -> 7303.77s]  encounter this gorilla, well the first thing you have to remember is you're dealing with a wild
[7303.77s -> 7309.05s]  animal, you're dealing with heartache, so first thing you need to do is make sure that if you are
[7309.05s -> 7313.45s]  going to approach these animals, make sure you take somebody slower than you, because you want
[7313.45s -> 7318.09s]  to be able to outrun them in case you get attacked by that animal, the gorilla, second of all,
[7318.81s -> 7322.73s]  don't forget to play dead, because then you'll know what it's like when they kill you,
[7323.53s -> 7330.01s]  and then I would advise against pepper spray, bears love the taste of pepper on human flesh,
[7330.01s -> 7335.21s]  I would suggest rubbing your body with steamed broccoli before going out after these animals,
[7335.21s -> 7339.29s]  wonderful thank you so much Randy, is there anything else you would like to say, did you get
[7339.29s -> 7344.41s]  any more information behind the motive from this gorilla, no really, just the whole conversation
[7344.41s -> 7349.69s]  was it was just bananas really, and I it's just crazy, I'm not okay okay, what we're gonna do,
[7349.69s -> 7358.12s]  that was fantastic, that was a great segue, tv has been turned off, a gorilla on the loose,
[7358.12s -> 7386.04s]  okay, I don't have broccoli, I don't have whatever else it was, yeah really,
[7388.12s -> 7397.16s]  right after the segment on television, I want to move, I want to move, I don't want to live
[7397.16s -> 7402.12s]  here anymore, why does it feel like everything is coming to get me, and there are my glasses,
[7403.08s -> 7408.60s]  that was loud, there's my glasses, everybody's coming, everybody's trying to kill me in this
[7408.60s -> 7417.46s]  town, how could you possibly live here for more than a week, what the fuck, I'm not going out
[7417.46s -> 7421.62s]  there, you saw what happened last time, I'm not going out there again to get attacked,
[7422.74s -> 7435.00s]  I'm gonna call a bear, call a bear, what does that even mean, call bear, call bear, I don't have a
[7435.00s -> 7445.54s]  bear's phone number, do I, I guess I do, my hand is doing it, hello, I'd like to, I'd like to call
[7445.54s -> 7454.10s]  the bear, a bear service to come attack, to help me, I guess, this is real service, okay, thank you,
[7454.10s -> 7460.58s]  how much does it cost, that's too much money, but all right, god damn it, god, send him, send him it,
[7461.54s -> 7476.47s]  what the fuck, hey, hey, it's a gorilla in my yard, it's a gorilla in my, shit,
[7478.71s -> 7519.27s]  did somebody just say red rum, are we all right, oh that's a quite a mess out here, nobody here,
[7519.27s -> 7525.24s]  okay, a bear, how much does that cost, a bear service, that was the bear that was here before,
[7525.24s -> 7531.13s]  but he was, he was friendly this time, what does that cost, I'm, the maid's gonna have to, I know
[7531.13s -> 7534.73s]  Amelia, I, Amelia, I'm still paying for your service, so that doesn't mean you don't come
[7534.73s -> 7554.12s]  anymore, 250 dollars for a bear, was it 2500 or 250, I was gonna say that's pretty cheap if it was
[7554.12s -> 7584.30s]  2500, good thing it was an extra zero, get this back over here, where it belongs please, this sucks,
[7585.46s -> 7599.69s]  this actually sucks, it sucks living here, I fucking hate living here, I actually don't like
[7599.69s -> 7609.61s]  being here, it's a nice house, but what is this neighborhood, bears, gorillas, people that aren't
[7609.61s -> 7614.54s]  drugs just attacking you, we're like church groups that come into your house and just don't even
[7614.54s -> 7619.74s]  knock, the police just sit on your couch and drink sodas and stuff, people drink beer out of my fridge,
[7620.70s -> 7649.98s]  mess, not today, not today, tomorrow, tomorrow, but tomorrow, why can't you just do tomorrow,
[7653.56s -> 7660.58s]  showed up like this, I'm gonna look, people are gonna be happy about it, hello, I'm going to work,
[7665.03s -> 7671.66s]  fine, just wait, I'm coming, that looks like a full car today, do I have to sit in the middle,
[7672.30s -> 7976.09s]  no, I don't want to sit in the middle, what, fine, just move, that was a long day,
[7976.17s -> 7981.40s]  this is because I sit in the middle because I'm the smallest one, I know I always put it up for grabs
[7981.40s -> 7985.56s]  and I always say I'll do it, but that doesn't mean I want to, maybe like next time I can get in the
[7985.56s -> 7992.82s]  front, like just once, just one time I sit in the front seat, sit in the middle, sucks, I know I'm
[7992.82s -> 7997.06s]  like the smallest guy, but whatever, whatever, whatever works, thank you, see you on Saturday,
[7997.86s -> 7999.14s]  if you get a fucking invite,

[8007.75s -> 8009.99s]  you do that all the time, you do that like every day,
[8015.54s -> 8018.18s]  I don't know if that's like a you're making like making me look like an idiot,
[8021.10s -> 8025.98s]  hi Edna, how are you, hi, hello, good day to you, good day, how are you, I'm doing well,

[8033.10s -> 8040.76s]  okay, see you later, okay, a lot of people in this neighborhood,
[8043.02s -> 8050.79s]  I gotta take this off, I'm gonna get more comfortable, but oh my brain, my brain,
[8050.79s -> 8064.54s]  I need to probably play a quickie keyboard, did that cost money, I mean, the maid has not been here,
[8065.26s -> 8073.06s]  I don't know where the maid has been, but look, I know we have like an issue, but like it,
[8073.06s -> 8091.93s]  you're still a maid, I pay for a service, was the maid here, was the maid in the house,

[8122.73s -> 8129.53s]  unbelievable, unbelievable, it was, that's money, I pay for a service regardless of if we have a
[8129.53s -> 8139.10s]  problem, it's unbelievable, take things from my goddamn house, because like what, because we had
[8139.10s -> 8145.27s]  a problem, we weren't even, we weren't even like, hold on, here's the worst part about this, but I'm
[8145.27s -> 8152.10s]  not even, we weren't even, we weren't even like doing anything, we would like, we had a date that

[9151.86s -> 9175.21s]  dream, oh, it's, it's Otto, wait, hold on, there was an explosion last night, it sounded like a bomb
[9175.21s -> 9187.77s]  went off, I don't know what it was, I mean, something just followed me, followed me through
[9188.25s -> 9211.13s]  here, it smelled, what was that, is it a gas line, holy shit, that's not me, is it, oh my god,
[9211.13s -> 9237.34s]  I think it is, you want one of these, sold out, what is this, oh, cabinets, the stool's in here,
[9238.70s -> 9243.08s]  and I'm not gonna show this, because I know, I know what you're gonna do,
[9243.80s -> 9249.14s]  I'm not gonna show it, because I know the audio guy, I know what they're gonna do,
[9250.10s -> 9254.58s]  in fact, audio guy, I don't want you to play the sound that you, that you want to play,
[9254.58s -> 9271.18s]  play something else, oh, there's a poop emoji in there, okay, what else is in here,
[9278.28s -> 9291.99s]  these are so heavy, oh, the stool, wow, we had a lot of these, and a smiley balloon,
[9292.23s -> 9307.48s]  oh, I kind of don't, oh, that's sad, that's really sad, nice cabinets, what a waste of money,
[9308.28s -> 9322.49s]  you could have bought literally anything else, what am I doing, decorate, decorate this room,
[9323.21s -> 9333.43s]  let me first of all do this, member of Jeremiah5.com, if you want some merchandise from this stream,
[9334.07s -> 9352.95s]  it's all sold out, but who cares, decorate, it's probably actually a pretty good time to do this
[9352.95s -> 9363.29s]  room, I think so, we'll do this, I don't like this being open, I don't like that,
[9364.65s -> 9378.17s]  I don't like that one, I like this one, I like that being open, this fell, get this out of the way,
[9380.63s -> 9387.13s]  this is the DIY room, and if you don't know what a DIY room is, do it yourself,
[9388.17s -> 9395.19s]  so we're gonna be you and I, of course, gonna be painting these rooms, maybe, pick a good color,
[9395.19s -> 9402.78s]  I hope you do, hey, want to see something crazy, I command this to go into the bathroom,
[9404.54s -> 9418.30s]  did it go into the bathroom, it did, I have magical powers, all right, let's move this,
[9419.62s -> 9429.62s]  I get this out of the way, this is so fucking heavy, my god, what a waste of fucking money,
[9438.34s -> 9447.56s]  okay, that's not gonna work, that's not gonna work, nothing else is gonna,
[9449.88s -> 9458.89s]  what do you have back here for me, what do you have, what the fuck, what, why,
[9458.89s -> 9472.57s]  I can't even move these, they're like in 10 pieces, okay, I don't, get all this out of the way,
[9473.91s -> 9500.68s]  out of the way, out, get this out of the way, open the door, so I can see what I'm doing, good,
[9500.68s -> 9506.18s]  all right, what do I want to do, number one thing I want to do in the DIY room,
[9507.91s -> 9513.27s]  I think we take out one of these walls, yep, this is a sledge hammer,
[9514.57s -> 9523.43s]  what do we got here, all right, this is good, this is a saw, I'm thinking right here, I think so,
[9524.23s -> 9534.18s]  what do you think, ready to get some wall, I think so, right there, I want an open bedroom
[9534.18s -> 9561.56s]  concept for my VR room, can't really, what happened, what, why does it not work, it's plugged in,
[9561.56s -> 9574.55s]  what the fuck, the saw is not working anymore, what happened, I think there's an electrical
[9574.55s -> 9583.56s]  problem, the saw doesn't work, the saw doesn't work, oh shit, that scared the shit out of me,
[9585.22s -> 9589.14s]  I can't get the saw to work, I'll try to figure it out, let me see if I can get this to work,
[9589.94s -> 9597.13s]  somehow, I probably lead to the fuse box, probably, that's probably what's going on,
[9602.95s -> 9607.00s]  where does this go, this goes somewhere, it's taped down over here, but
[9611.53s -> 9617.08s]  why would it stop working, I plugged it into the base downstairs, I have like a whole unit
[9617.08s -> 9620.52s]  that's down there, there's like four or five extension cords that go out, I don't know,
[9620.52s -> 9635.96s]  I don't get it, what is going on, what is going on, what the heck is this, who are you, I'm your
[9635.96s -> 9642.17s]  neighbor, I'm Jim Matthew, I live next door, what are you doing, what are you doing my electricity,
[9642.97s -> 9647.21s]  I plugged this in downstairs, my unit downstairs, what are you doing, no way, that thing's coming
[9647.21s -> 9651.37s]  straight from my house, you can follow it down the street, listen, when I grew up, that's called
[9651.37s -> 9655.45s]  thievery, I don't know what you think that is, well, I saw a place to plug it in, I plugged it in,
[9655.45s -> 9660.33s]  I didn't know if it was yours or not, you didn't check first, no, I mean, electricity plugs are
[9660.33s -> 9665.45s]  just, I can just use them, what is this place, this is your plug, yes, my plug, that's okay,
[9665.77s -> 9672.57s]  which are you, 9-8-0, 9-8-2, what are you, yeah, 9-8-0, 9-8-0, I live down past Edna,
[9673.05s -> 9678.09s]  oh cool, yeah, you met Ludwig, yeah, it's crazy, this many people live here,
[9678.09s -> 9686.17s]  it's weird, dollhouse lane, listen, I'm gonna need that back, I'm working on a project up here,
[9686.17s -> 9689.05s]  working on a project, yeah, it looks like it, you have no clue what you're doing, do you,
[9689.69s -> 9694.73s]  I don't really, I mean, that is not the right tool for the job, I gotta tell you that,
[9694.73s -> 9699.37s]  I tell you that much, that's not the right tool for the job, that's for sure, okay, well,
[9699.37s -> 9705.37s]  this is more confusing than a fart in a fan factory up here, all right, well, excuse me, Jeb,
[9706.25s -> 9713.13s]  oh lord, hey listen, I tell you what, that's your electricity, yeah, electricity, so I've been,
[9713.13s -> 9718.17s]  haven't been taking it from you, have I, I mean, we'll have to see, my bill has been exceptionally
[9718.17s -> 9721.85s]  high, but I thought, how high has your bill been, I mean, a couple extra hundred, a couple extra
[9722.17s -> 9726.49s]  per month, listen, my son, he's been doing some weird things on the computer, I figured
[9726.49s -> 9733.85s]  there's something like that, but you never know, okay, all right, Jeb, oh lord, so, I tell you what,
[9735.21s -> 9739.37s]  you keeping those, you keeping these, no, so these, these appeared last night, I don't even
[9739.37s -> 9743.53s]  know where they're from, okay, I mean, because I don't mind, maybe just to pay for the electricity,
[9743.53s -> 9747.61s]  I can bring them back to my place, well, I don't actually owe you any money, considering that,
[9748.25s -> 9754.17s]  well, the electricity, I mean, the electricity's mine, that's the thing, do you know how, I tried
[9754.17s -> 9759.21s]  to get this to work, the saw doesn't work, okay, the saw doesn't work, okay, basic safety, yeah,
[9759.21s -> 9763.13s]  yeah, yeah, that's a good idea, let me show you a couple things, okay, let me show you, my daddy
[9763.13s -> 9767.77s]  taught me this, okay, he taught me two things, NASCAR and how to fix stuff, well, you're not,
[9767.77s -> 9772.09s]  you know this stuff, exactly, exactly, holy smokes, okay, the two are pretty synonymous, by the way,
[9772.09s -> 9775.05s]  so what, what, what can you tell, what, what, what, what should we do in this room,
[9775.05s -> 9780.57s]  uh, okay, well, are you, are you like a handy guy, oh, for sure, yeah, absolutely, absolutely,
[9780.57s -> 9784.73s]  I mean, I would, I would start for sure, you got to get some paint up on the walls, okay,
[9785.53s -> 9790.17s]  probably move some stuff around, it's pretty dirty, tripping hazard, interesting, do you,
[9790.17s -> 9793.93s]  do you know this guy, he looks a little, I've never seen him before in my life,
[9794.73s -> 9798.49s]  no idea, that one guy's lovely though, I've seen him, let me see if I can see who this is,
[9799.45s -> 9804.01s]  the, is that you, Kiteboga, Kiteboga, whatever, I don't know, I don't know if you've ever heard
[9804.01s -> 9809.61s]  of those people, German985.com, they're all sold out, okay, I mean, yeah, it seems like you have
[9809.61s -> 9813.13s]  literally no idea what you're doing, what, what do you, would you think we should start with
[9813.13s -> 9816.73s]  painting, is that what you think, well, I mean, the first thing we're gonna have to do is paint,
[9816.73s -> 9821.93s]  absolutely, okay, have you dusted the walls yet, uh, I've, I've pre-dusted, have you checked for
[9821.93s -> 9826.97s]  prints, I've checked for all, yes, yeah, because, well, you never know, did you build this house
[9827.05s -> 9830.57s]  yourself or you move in, because you never know if it's like a crime scene or something,
[9830.57s -> 9834.81s]  I, I, I woke up one day and I had a sling on my arm and I walked over here and this was just here,
[9834.81s -> 9839.77s]  so, I just figured it was mine, a sling on your arm, yeah, I got a broken arm and I, I went through
[9839.77s -> 9846.25s]  a window, uh, a few weeks ago, um, you went through a window, were you here when the fire happened,
[9846.25s -> 9850.25s]  were you, you, I heard, I heard some siren, actually, I think I called the fire department,
[9850.25s -> 9854.57s]  is that you, I think I did, thank God for you, because I, I shattered my arm going through the
[9855.13s -> 9858.89s]  window, but I'm fine, though, I'm all right, you mind if I, uh, let me show you something here,
[9858.89s -> 9863.53s]  okay, so you got the stools, how about pink, you got the stools, does pink work for you,
[9864.49s -> 9868.73s]  pink, I mean, I don't think it'll look good, but that's what you want, if that's what you want,
[9868.73s -> 9872.89s]  what wall do you think I should do for pink, what do you think, what wall, yeah, what do you,
[9872.89s -> 9875.93s]  what do you even do, what are you even doing in here, is this like your, well, this is gonna be
[9875.93s -> 9880.33s]  my VR room, I wanna build a jump around in virtual reality, VR, what on earth is that,
[9880.41s -> 9885.21s]  virtual reality, virtual, you're getting a headset now, it's gonna be my VR room, I swear,
[9885.21s -> 9889.37s]  you kids have no clue what's going on, virtual reality, you called it, what is that,
[9890.57s -> 9895.05s]  by the way, I know you probably smelled gas coming up here, gas, like gasoline, it's me,
[9895.05s -> 9899.21s]  I just wanna make sure you're aware of that, no, my, my smell ain't that great, but,
[9902.41s -> 9908.17s]  gasoline, so you wanna paint over all pink, I wanna paint pink, virtual reality,
[9908.17s -> 9913.05s]  it's not quite sure what wall we're doing pink at the moment, okay, I mean, what about,
[9913.05s -> 9917.05s]  you got this wall here, that's nice, this pretty sturdy wall, back wall, all right,
[9917.05s -> 9923.00s]  how about we do pink, I need a tool to open this, have you tested these walls for stability,
[9923.00s -> 9930.81s]  oh good lord, sorry, I just like to do that, okay, let me get this paint open, you have no,
[9930.81s -> 9934.33s]  you have no clue what you're doing, do you know how to open paint, I've opened paint, I feel like
[9934.33s -> 9941.93s]  it's a tuna can, I've opened paint, I've opened tuna, you did both, I sure have, you live in the
[9941.93s -> 9948.89s]  United States, we had tuna sandwiches every day when we were kids, okay, pink paint for virtual
[9948.89s -> 9955.78s]  reality, why is that, I just wanna make sure I wear this, I would probably take off my shoes,
[9955.78s -> 9960.90s]  if you don't want them to be covered in paint, you want me to take, so let me get this straight,
[9960.90s -> 9967.38s]  you steal my electricity, this is not stirred, by the way, how do I stir this, listen, sit back
[9967.38s -> 9972.18s]  and relax, this stuff's easy, okay, it's all intuitive, it's all in your head, okay, you know
[9972.18s -> 9978.78s]  what you're talking about, Steve, I don't even know your name, Jeb, Jeb, all right, let's get that pink
[9978.78s -> 9985.74s]  up there, are you a painter, of course I am, okay, good, that looks pretty good, you like that, yeah,
[9986.70s -> 9992.38s]  so how long you lived here for, oh, you can't even get on my floor, I'm sorry about that, okay,
[9992.38s -> 9995.18s]  listen, I told you I know how to paint, I didn't tell you, I knew how to be
[9996.38s -> 10001.34s]  cleanly, all right, so we just dump it in here, yeah, dump it, are you a handy person or are,
[10001.34s -> 10007.82s]  I got hands, yeah, we'll make this work, all right, we'll make this work, what wall are you putting it
[10007.82s -> 10013.34s]  on, huh, on the back wall, the back wall, okay, east face and north face and south, I don't know,
[10013.42s -> 10017.18s]  I don't have a compass, you have no idea, it depends on where the moss grows, you know what,
[10017.18s -> 10022.14s]  by the way, you're a mess, excuse me, you're a waste, I'm sorry, did you say a waste, you're a
[10022.14s -> 10027.98s]  big fat mistake, I don't understand, listen, my mother told me I fell off the ugly tree and at
[10027.98s -> 10032.78s]  every branch on the way, but I have never been more offended by someone I've never met in my life,
[10032.78s -> 10036.22s]  okay, I'm going for the back wall, and now you're painting, you're just gonna paint now, yeah,
[10038.02s -> 10041.06s]  man, I have half a mind to leave right now, okay, he's painting, you're painting,
[10041.86s -> 10044.98s]  okay, you got to put more, do you think it looks good, you got to put more paint on them,
[10044.98s -> 10053.99s]  okay, why don't you grab a brush and help me, why pink again, why was that, why pink, why are you
[10053.99s -> 10058.95s]  doing pink, uh, because the demons in my head told me to, okay, you're talking about Satan,
[10059.83s -> 10063.27s]  well, it could be, I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet, you want to do nice,
[10064.39s -> 10067.59s]  you got to do angled lines, like, do you go up and down or do you go side to side,
[10067.59s -> 10073.03s]  you got to go side to side or angles, better coverage, by the way, and I really do mean this,
[10073.03s -> 10076.87s]  and this is not a joke, this is not a joke in the stream, this is not a joke for anything,
[10076.87s -> 10081.83s]  this is real life, uh, this is the first time I have ever, in my entire adult life,
[10081.83s -> 10087.51s]  in my entire childhood life, have ever put paint on a wall, ever, congratulations son,
[10087.51s -> 10094.68s]  congratulations, hey, there's a first time for everything, uh, I don't think we're, we need to
[10095.16s -> 10099.64s]  ladder, to get the top of this, by the way, is that, is that why you, is that why you picked
[10099.64s -> 10104.04s]  pink, because you've never painted before, or does it have something to do with virtual reality,
[10104.04s -> 10109.96s]  oh, I just thought it was a cool color, I thought it would look nice, okay, that looks pretty good,
[10109.96s -> 10115.56s]  you met my, you met my kids yet, same, I smell, I can't, I, I'm, it's making me gab, it's making me
[10115.56s -> 10121.88s]  gab, I'm gabbing about it, it's smell, I smell so awful, smells like my bass boat, I'm sorry,
[10121.88s -> 10126.60s]  I really apologize that I smelled this awful, oh, it's fine, it's, it's, look, it's the wood,
[10126.60s -> 10131.72s]  the wood has, emanates like a disgusting onion and like taco smell, I mean, it definitely smells
[10131.72s -> 10135.96s]  like something living, it's coming from something living, I'm really sorry about this, I really am,
[10135.96s -> 10140.84s]  I don't usually, I usually bathe at least once every day, so you live here alone though, yeah,
[10140.84s -> 10144.28s]  no one to help you paint, no one to help you do nothing, no, I haven't bathed in eight days,
[10145.48s -> 10148.36s]  eight days, eight, is that right, yeah, I'm sorry, I have to tell you that,
[10149.32s -> 10153.64s]  that's okay, the pig's back in my yard, don't bathe either, oh, I could be like, what are your
[10153.64s -> 10161.38s]  piggies, what the fuck would I say that to somebody in a public setting, we still love them though,
[10161.38s -> 10170.46s]  what, is it pink or pink, is it pink or pink, we're talking about pink balls,
[10175.58s -> 10182.30s]  you picked the colors, I was like, why are they saying that, I think, that's how we say it around

[10715.74s -> 10721.29s]  to take care of something, you don't want to paint it or nothing, just give me a second,
[10721.29s -> 10725.37s]  let's get a cup of this, okay, no, I don't want to, I want to get rid of it, it's a VR room,

[10939.45s -> 10953.11s]  Jeff, hey Jeff, get along with it, more afraid in my life than right now, I may have just sold my

[11271.56s -> 11276.52s]  you bought it, what's that, you built this house yourself or you bought it, I bought this house,
[11276.52s -> 11281.16s]  it was upgraded a few times, but I, okay, because this, this is strange, okay, there's no reason,
[11281.16s -> 11288.58s]  there's no reason to have this in a closet, okay, and listen to this, right, yep, you see,
[11290.02s -> 11294.49s]  this is not mine, look at this, look at this, holy shit, that is real weird,
[11295.61s -> 11300.25s]  there's something behind here, by the way, we might be able to take this down, but I am not sure,
[11302.89s -> 11308.89s]  oh okay, I'm just going to step over, get this fucking thing down, we can't get the door frame
[11308.89s -> 11319.18s]  down, I'm not sure about that, you know, there's a painting in here, Jab, let's look at that,
[11319.18s -> 11325.66s]  really interesting, do we have it, I want to see what's back there, that's why, I don't know what
[11325.66s -> 11330.30s]  that is, I mean, the weird part is that whole painting is kind of like stuck to the wall,
[11330.46s -> 11333.66s]  why is it, it's like glued, it's like the previous owner put something there,
[11333.66s -> 11336.46s]  all right, hold on, let me see, can I cut it, how old is this house,
[11337.50s -> 11341.75s]  hold on, can I cut through it, you got to put a little more effort into it,
[11346.94s -> 11350.62s]  have you ever used that in your life, I've never used one of these before, I mean in real life,
[11350.62s -> 11358.49s]  either, okay, first time for everything, that's all right, okay, why would there be a painting
[11358.49s -> 11365.93s]  back here, I mean, I guess it could be some sort of shrine, you did say there were demons in the
[11365.93s -> 11372.39s]  house, okay, you did say there were demons in the house, maybe someone was trying to do some
[11372.39s -> 11380.68s]  sort of, you know, Jab, give me the sledgehammer, okay, I'm gonna walk away now, you can give a
[11380.68s -> 11392.31s]  little force to it, okay, you're not really good at that, this is definitely something back here,
[11392.31s -> 11399.90s]  Jab, what do you think's back there, why is this made of steel, are you kidding me,
[11401.70s -> 11409.82s]  holy shit, there are screws here, hold on, okay, there's that too, I mean, you really can't cut
[11409.82s -> 11416.94s]  that, I'm scared, have you ever been to the dentist, Jab, I have never been, no thank you,
[11416.94s -> 11424.98s]  no thank you, all right, what is the, I don't understand, why is it here, it's the wrong way,
[11424.98s -> 11428.18s]  how do I get to go, I'll tell you what, I bet you could cut through it if you'd like, would you like
[11428.18s -> 11431.30s]  me to cut through it, how do you get this to go in reverse, okay, let me see, you go ahead and try,
[11432.50s -> 11437.38s]  I'll take care of everything for you, can it go in reverse, yeah, this is the wrong thing,
[11437.38s -> 11442.18s]  that ain't gonna work, okay, I'll tell you what, where's that knife, where's that knife,
[11442.18s -> 11446.50s]  Jab, be careful, it's hard to cut through, I'll be careful, all right, I'll be careful,
[11446.50s -> 11450.82s]  be very careful, I promise, it's a very sharp knife, thank you, thank you, my liege, thank you,
[11450.82s -> 11456.82s]  be careful, so you moved here, yeah, how long ago, a week ago, two weeks ago, okay, you married all,
[11456.82s -> 11460.34s]  no, you're not married, I've never been married, not married, okay, why not,
[11461.38s -> 11465.62s]  because it's not, I'm not ready yet, you know, somebody asked me the same question
[11466.26s -> 11469.70s]  a week ago, the same exact thing, the sleep demons are telling you something,
[11469.70s -> 11474.26s]  no, somebody that may even be part of your family, I don't know, excuse me,
[11474.26s -> 11478.58s]  I don't know, just focus on that, it's a very sharp blade, sorry, I've done this a couple times,
[11479.94s -> 11486.02s]  unfortunately, this is the most sturdy painting, there's been a few times in my life where I'd
[11486.02s -> 11491.72s]  have to take down a painting, we're almost done, I'm gonna let you do the, you got it,
[11491.72s -> 11497.72s]  I'm gonna let you do most of the work, here, okay, looks good, you seen the fitness,
[11498.76s -> 11502.04s]  the instructor, yeah, you might want to do that, has he gone in your house,
[11502.84s -> 11507.72s]  oh yeah, he goes in your house too, all right, why do you let him do that, that's like his
[11507.72s -> 11513.80s]  home invasion, you didn't sign the HOA, no, what HOA, okay, all right, let's see if we can
[11513.80s -> 11518.68s]  get in there, let me see that knife, okay, you want the knife, yeah, there you are, I just,
[11518.68s -> 11523.00s]  I want to get this away from everybody, oh, I understand, okay, can we get in there,
[11523.00s -> 11529.64s]  yeah, let me see, there's something back here, I think, here, there's something, good lord,
[11530.84s -> 11545.30s]  holy shit, what is that, what is this, there's a safe back here, what is that, okay, and you said
[11545.30s -> 11552.66s]  you bought this house, I bought this house, okay, oh my god, it's a safe, you know how to get that
[11552.66s -> 11561.88s]  open or not, I don't know the code, hold on, let me try it, okay, let me just double check,
[11561.88s -> 11565.40s]  have you ever opened a safe before, because I'm finding there are a significant number of things
[11565.40s -> 11569.32s]  you've never done, I watch YouTube videos that can explain it, you listen for the little, okay,
[11570.36s -> 11577.08s]  do you hear that, right there, do you hear, right there, okay, yeah, I don't hear nothing,
[11577.08s -> 11584.04s]  I can't get it, you could sledgehammer it, I mean, maybe, I do know a guy, this is, I swear to god,
[11584.04s -> 11589.24s]  this house was built, like, five days ago, that's weird, okay, I may accept you, I know a guy,
[11589.96s -> 11594.28s]  if you need help, I know a locksmith, we could call, you know a guy, I know a guy, I got a guy
[11594.28s -> 11599.08s]  for everything, we could break it too, you want to try, we could, listen, I'm gonna say, I don't
[11599.08s -> 11602.92s]  have a significant amount of confidence, so you're gonna be able to break that safe, if you couldn't
[11602.92s -> 11607.80s]  break that wall down, but that's just me, I mean, is that like a joke or something, I've been proved
[11607.80s -> 11612.76s]  wrong before, but that's all right, if you want to give it a shot, give your guy a call, okay,
[11612.76s -> 11618.20s]  all right, can I borrow your phone though, because it's downstairs, it's downstairs,
[11618.20s -> 11621.56s]  it's down in the kitchen, okay, yeah, well, you know a guy that can come do this, yeah, yeah,
[11621.56s -> 11632.12s]  give me two seconds, okay, two seconds, he knows a guy, okay, to open the safe, I don't know what's
[11632.12s -> 11637.35s]  in it, because I, this is an upgrade, I didn't, I didn't know this was even in here, was this part
[11637.35s -> 11641.51s]  of the foundation, well, the foundation is on the ground, so, German, what are you stupid,
[11642.47s -> 11655.67s]  we're like on a second story, he knows a guy, call him, I think people like tools, because of the
[11655.67s -> 11660.23s]  sounds they make, you think that too, you guys think that too, you know what I mean, just like,
[11660.23s -> 11666.86s]  it's like, oh yeah, let me get my tool, it feels like, it feels very like manly, like, oh yeah,
[11668.86s -> 11674.62s]  how you doing man, yeah, okay, you're not busy right now, listen, I got a thing or two, we could,
[11674.62s -> 11680.84s]  we could get taken care of, we won't come on down, get him down, yeah, come on over pronto,
[11680.84s -> 11688.84s]  I got a little bit of a situation, I could use your help with, okay, yeah, no problem, okay,
[11690.01s -> 11701.30s]  America, all right, I can't get it, I don't know the combo, I don't know what to do,
[11701.30s -> 11714.04s]  hey, can you get the door, yeah, I got you, I got the door, if it's your guy,
[11714.04s -> 11721.13s]  I don't want to pretend, I don't want to greet him, you know him, come on in, come on in,
[11722.89s -> 11728.17s]  hey Jeff, hey, how's it going my guy, good to see you, oh you are a blue collar as always,
[11728.17s -> 11733.37s]  come on in, come on in, listen, if you could keep this on the down low, all right, I got a safe
[11733.37s -> 11737.93s]  situation up there, I need, I need someone to crack it, I want to make sure that, I'll make sure
[11737.93s -> 11741.93s]  you get paid, if you know what I mean, sure, yeah, all right, let's head upstairs, anything for you
[11741.93s -> 11747.29s]  Jeff, thank you brother, it's not your place right, down the street, oh no, no, no, not for sure,
[11747.29s -> 11754.25s]  keep going, keep going, this is confusing layout, I'm gonna tell you right now, that makes no
[11754.25s -> 11758.49s]  fucking sense, this whole house don't make sense, that makes zero sense, he's trying to paint his
[11758.49s -> 11763.77s]  wall pink and black, what, pink up there, that sounds dumb, you can go up the stairs, it could be gems,
[11763.77s -> 11772.44s]  oh stairs, okay, jewels, gold, there might be gold in there, gold still expensive, if it's gold,
[11772.44s -> 11775.64s]  that's awesome, who would put a safe in a wall, that's ridiculous,
[11778.36s -> 11783.86s]  why would you put a safe in a wall, unless it was to hide something very, very important, hey, what,
[11785.94s -> 11790.92s]  what the fuck is this, a little bit of a war zone up here, we swear we come in a room, okay,
[11792.20s -> 11795.80s]  all right, this is my guy, that's your guy, he can take care of pretty much anything, what's your
[11795.80s -> 11799.00s]  guys name, what's your name, what's up, what's your name, I'm a locksmith, he doesn't need it
[11799.00s -> 11805.16s]  now right, no, okay, all right, you're good, okay, we have a safe here, okay, that we, I didn't want
[11805.16s -> 11809.56s]  to break it, didn't want to swing at it or anything, all right, but it's here and I just,
[11809.56s -> 11813.32s]  can you get into this, for the record, have you tried to get into it while I was going,
[11813.32s -> 11816.76s]  I tried, why would I know what combination it was, I don't know, the sense you're saying,
[11816.76s -> 11823.00s]  it should be pretty standard, okay, was it behind anything, it was a painting in a wall, he's a
[11823.00s -> 11833.26s]  neighbor, yeah, religious, does it mean anything, does it mean anything, can you just let me,
[11833.26s -> 11837.10s]  okay, all right, you can stick the painting, something, I don't know if it's a code word,
[11838.30s -> 11843.18s]  listen, do you, that's a hot locksmith, I just want to make sure that's clear, that's all,
[11843.18s -> 11847.66s]  what's up, beautiful, you called over one of the most attractive locksmiths I've ever met in my
[11847.66s -> 11851.58s]  whole life, I just want to know, he's a good looking man, but can you not come on to me,
[11851.58s -> 11854.70s]  I'm trying to do my job, appreciate that, just keep doing what you're doing, that's like an
[11854.70s -> 11859.58s]  ocean violation, he's very, very, he's really, really sweet and he's very sweet, how many days
[11860.06s -> 11864.78s]  I told you he can get in anything, ride the boat, the rain, how long was the rain, a week,
[11865.98s -> 11873.50s]  the rain, 40 days and 49, 40 days and 49, what's the time frame on you getting into that,
[11873.50s -> 11878.14s]  the safe, are you rushing me, no, I just was curious, I don't know how long it took,
[11878.14s -> 11883.66s]  I mean, the bench, okay, well I hope he gets it, I'm gonna ask you, I'll ask you a quick question,
[11883.66s -> 11887.82s]  yeah, are you familiar with the idea that nine possession is nine tenths of the law,
[11888.70s -> 11893.34s]  you're gonna have to say that again and like explain like I'm five, okay, position, they say
[11893.34s -> 11898.54s]  position is nine tenths of the law, you understand that, I will explain it, okay, so conceptually it
[11898.54s -> 11904.70s]  would mean, okay, you know what nine tenths is, it means nine out of ten, yeah, I think that,
[11904.70s -> 11911.58s]  hold on, how many percentages is that, I think here's the point, whoever has what's in that safe
[11912.54s -> 11920.58s]  owns it, you understand, you're just making no sense to me, okay, I can't get it, what do you
[11920.58s -> 11926.18s]  mean you can't get it, I'm fucking with you, I'm the best, okay, all right, you want to get in there,
[11926.18s -> 11932.42s]  well you got it, what's in it, whoa, what's in it, okay, okay, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[11932.42s -> 11936.10s]  wait a second, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, well we have to have a conversation about,
[11936.10s -> 11940.34s]  no, no, no, no, no, let me see that, I don't know, position is nine tenths of the law,
[11942.34s -> 11946.58s]  no, I have no clue, that's good, you got the safe open, well, you know, it's a pleasure to
[11946.58s -> 11951.14s]  work with you as well, it's, you got the safe open, okay, take a couple, you got the safe open, yeah,
[11951.14s -> 11955.30s]  thank you, let me see what's in there, well, what if we just figure out payment, let me see what's
[11955.30s -> 11964.10s]  in the safe, get downstairs now, okay, why are we going downstairs, because I don't, I want everybody
[11964.10s -> 11968.34s]  out of this room, because I don't want to be up here, get downstairs, you might want to pocket
[11968.34s -> 11972.58s]  some of that, it's my goddamn house, whatever's in the wall is mine, that's absolute bullshit,
[11972.58s -> 11977.14s]  ton of money, I don't, I'm not comfortable with you touching all of the stuff that's in a, in a
[11977.14s -> 11981.78s]  wall in my house, you, you didn't even know it was there though, it's my house, so you took it from
[11981.78s -> 11986.42s]  my house, I mean, but he didn't build this house, private property actually, he didn't build this
[11986.42s -> 11992.18s]  house, hallelujah brother, let's just, hold on, let's wait, let's just go ahead, let's get an ad
[11992.18s -> 11996.90s]  break, ad break, I want to get this sorted, I'm sorry, what did you say, a what break, just go into
[11996.90s -> 12002.82s]  the kitchen, what is this guy talking about, ad break now, hey, we're going to sort this, thank you,
[12002.82s -> 12421.54s]  don't hand people money that didn't do it, I want to take a quick second to go over a couple things,
[12422.26s -> 12429.78s]  kind of off camera, with just no, no jokes or anything, I want to talk about the show
[12429.78s -> 12436.34s]  and how it even was able to happen in the first place, Coinbase came in at the last second
[12437.06s -> 12444.42s]  and let us be able to do this show, and when I, when I say that I mean that, all the things you see
[12444.42s -> 12448.90s]  back here were really only possible because of this company here, and I really mean that, I
[12448.90s -> 12454.34s]  wouldn't say it if it wasn't true, Twitch came in and gave us a bunch of money, Coinbase gave us a
[12454.34s -> 12461.30s]  bunch of money, what you see here is only because of those two companies, and I couldn't afford any
[12461.30s -> 12467.30s]  of this stuff, there's no way I could have done any of this on my own, and when you talk about
[12467.30s -> 12472.82s]  like sponsorships, talk about sponsors, you've seen the show, you've seen, they've let us do
[12472.82s -> 12478.90s]  whatever we want, we didn't have to do anything, Twitch and Coinbase we had, they just let us do
[12478.90s -> 12486.09s]  what we wanted, I've used Coinbase for the last five years, those of you that know this channel,
[12486.09s -> 12492.39s]  I used to have an Ethereum address that you could donate to, it was real, and I have to thank them
[12492.39s -> 12499.38s]  because without their support the show doesn't happen, doesn't happen without them, and also
[12499.38s -> 12502.34s]  there's so many people to thank, we're not going to have that much opportunity to thank everybody,
[12502.34s -> 12506.78s]  but seriously I'm going to take the opportunity now, but seriously if you're into cryptocurrency,
[12506.78s -> 12511.64s]  if you want to learn more about the space, it's a great place to start, and they gave us a
[12511.64s -> 12517.08s]  significant amount of capital to make this show happen, so thank you Coinbase, thank you Twitch,
[12517.08s -> 12523.88s]  also while I have a second here, because this is the finale, JK Productions, Community Jake,
[12524.89s -> 12530.73s]  this is impossible without these people, Andy Mark, Ghost Commander, Criken and his team,
[12531.99s -> 12538.94s]  this went off without a hitch, it's seriously like, sure this is the idea that I came up with,
[12538.94s -> 12547.00s]  but you can't do this without a ton of dedicated people, the glass breaking, when we did that,
[12547.00s -> 12552.06s]  Andy Mark, the engineers and Andy Mark came up with all this stuff, there's so many people,
[12552.06s -> 12558.55s]  Ludwig, Kit Boga, Milton, there's so many people back here that you don't see, I wanted just to
[12558.55s -> 12565.91s]  kind of address it real quick, because I wasn't going to have an opportunity to, but again I want
[12565.91s -> 12569.43s]  to like, we'll focus on, there's so many people to thank, there's so many people that made this
[12569.43s -> 12577.77s]  happen, but Coinbase, go check them out, please do, they gave us so much money to do this, and it's,
[12577.77s -> 12582.34s]  they just wanted to make a good show, they wanted to make a good show, and I think it has been,
[12582.34s -> 12588.15s]  I think it's been a lot of fun, so that's because of Twitch and Coinbase, thank you both of you,
[12588.15s -> 12594.95s]  we'll go back to the show, I've actually used Coinbase, I really have, for five years, I mean it,
[12594.95s -> 12610.02s]  and I'll go back to the show, let's break the fourth one, what's going on in here, I thought
[12610.02s -> 12622.38s]  that was a bug, hey, have you guys heard anything in back, I was just kind of back there, just
[12622.38s -> 12626.82s]  messing around a little bit, sure, we were just talking, I mean, yeah, you've got quite a bit of
[12626.82s -> 12632.81s]  money here, okay, you've got quite a bit of money, so, hypothetically speaking, we were thinking,
[12632.81s -> 12638.09s]  we could make this whole thing go away, that's a, that's a, can I hold that, well yeah, I was
[12638.09s -> 12643.05s]  talking to Jeb, and I figured we just split it, you know, maybe three-way, yeah, me, Jeb, and he has a
[12643.85s -> 12648.81s]  actually a dog named Buck, you're gonna do a three-way split, between the three of us,
[12649.53s -> 12653.29s]  it's in my wall, but he wouldn't gotten in, all right, let me count how much money this is,
[12653.93s -> 12658.01s]  I mean, hypothetically speaking, if we were to have taken the money and walked away, no one would
[12658.01s -> 12664.73s]  believe you, that we were honest, it's 1200 bucks, so, that's pretty bad math, it's 1200 dollars,
[12664.73s -> 12668.57s]  when you were gone, I got something in your hat, listen, I didn't get much beyond the sixth grade,
[12668.57s -> 12675.69s]  and I can tell you that, hey, that's 1200 bucks, from what you've done, blue-collar-wise, you seem,
[12676.25s -> 12684.09s]  it seems slow, what, you know, the painting, you seem a bit slow, I'm very fast, let me show you,
[12684.09s -> 12687.05s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[12687.05s -> 12690.65s]  that's actually impressive, that's very impressive, admittedly nothing to do with blue-collar,
[12690.65s -> 12695.05s]  that'd be crazy, that'd be an extra violation, just to do that, toy boat, toy boat, and I figured
[12695.05s -> 12699.85s]  out that great white-collar, so, you know, I got a lawyer friend, okay, I just call him in, we just
[12699.85s -> 12704.25s]  square it away, he's got a guy, I don't know why we need law in this, this is literally my house,
[12704.73s -> 12707.29s]  I mean, what do you want, you want me to just give you a hundred bucks, and I'll give you a hundred
[12707.29s -> 12713.93s]  bucks, how much is your fee, zero change, my fee, yeah, it's not, it's not flat, it's percentage-based,
[12713.93s -> 12718.49s]  and then there's a finder, there's a finder's fee, a finder's fee, because I find it, let me just call
[12718.49s -> 12725.21s]  him up, let me just call him up, oh, finder's fee, my giant dollars of bills, call your lawyer,
[12725.21s -> 12729.77s]  sure, get a lawyer in here, you realize you never would have found the money if it ain't for us,
[12729.77s -> 12734.57s]  is this stevenson, stevenson, stevenson, already, you just need a lawyer down here,
[12735.77s -> 12740.73s]  weirdo at nine eight five, nine eight, why don't we just take this and put it like, yeah, there's
[12740.73s -> 12744.25s]  beer here, that ain't your money, that ain't your money, you might want to put it down there, but
[12744.25s -> 12750.01s]  yeah, if you could just come down, we just got a dispute really, you mind if I have some of this
[12750.01s -> 12756.49s]  bread, go ahead, yeah, he's being kind of a dick, yeah, so, I don't know if we can just figure that
[12756.49s -> 12761.21s]  out, that'd be great, I'll see you in a bit, is that all you got in this house, this bread, this
[12761.21s -> 12764.89s]  mac and cheese up there, but it takes a while to make, just forget it, could go for a homemade
[12764.89s -> 12772.87s]  cookie, yeah, just eat a cookie if you want, so you know a guy, he knows about finder's fees, he
[12772.87s -> 12780.07s]  knows about your percentage, oh, I'm so tired, get the door, by my house, we're doing everything
[12780.07s -> 12783.11s]  for him, he's like, he doesn't do a lot of work around here, he wants to keep the money,
[12784.87s -> 12789.21s]  hey man, you see that over there, hey, how you doing buddy, how's it going, come on in, come on in,
[12790.73s -> 12795.93s]  wow, this is quite the establishment you got here, yeah, well, it's not mine, it's this guy's, but,
[12795.93s -> 12800.89s]  hey, hey, how's it going, hey, oh, I know you, you play on the same softball team,
[12800.89s -> 12806.97s]  that's right, hey, who's this, is this the homeowner, this is the homeowner, he's a bit erratic, a bit,
[12807.53s -> 12812.33s]  I just don't think he's mentally fit enough to be able to handle the situation, well, nice to meet
[12812.33s -> 12819.29s]  you, but, hey, it's Bob, Doug, Stevenson, part of Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson and Randy, it's
[12819.29s -> 12824.09s]  been a long day, I'm tired, okay, well, hey, I'm here from the property management law firm of
[12824.09s -> 12828.81s]  Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson and Randy, yeah, and I was called down, well, first of all, this
[12828.81s -> 12832.81s]  is quite a nice place you got here, just want to let you know a couple of things, zoning rights
[12832.81s -> 12840.73s]  that we have, okay, all right, now listen, what's, what's the pickle we got, I got $50,000 in, it was
[12840.73s -> 12846.25s]  in my wall, and they want money, okay, so here, let me get, let me get it right, okay, he was stealing
[12846.25s -> 12850.25s]  my electricity for a significant amount of time, I'll make that very clear, the only reason I was
[12850.25s -> 12853.69s]  in this establishment is because he stole my electricity, back in my day, we called that
[12853.69s -> 12859.69s]  thievery, oh, thievery, 100%, 100%, that's a sin, that's in the Bible, then I called my guy here,
[12859.69s -> 12863.45s]  I called my guy, so it was a finder's fee for me, I think that's legal, I think that's legal,
[12863.45s -> 12868.33s]  he's for, I get money, that's right, I call my guy, he takes care of everything, right, I mean,
[12868.33s -> 12871.21s]  look at him, he can take care of anything, you know what I'm saying, hey, ain't that the truth,
[12871.21s -> 12876.09s]  if you lock, I'll open it, you know, we don't have a slogan yet, but we were shopping that one,
[12876.09s -> 12882.65s]  my wife was saying the same thing, she said they're locksmiths, hey, so what are we doing here,
[12882.65s -> 12886.73s]  this is what we're dealing with, well, we need to disperse the money, okay, so you found this money,
[12886.73s -> 12890.49s]  we found a saint in the side of the room up there, okay, fucking, there was smithy granite,
[12890.49s -> 12895.61s]  well, now, you say we found the money, so you mean, it wasn't just you who found the money,
[12896.41s -> 12900.09s]  was there some, which one of you, which one of you, we found it and he helped, oh, I mean,
[12900.09s -> 12906.81s]  I found it, 100%, okay, at least nine, well, nine tenths of the law, not possession is nine tenths,
[12906.81s -> 12910.09s]  you know, have you ever heard possession is nine tenths of the law, did he just fall asleep,
[12910.09s -> 12919.29s]  hey, is he, is he literally sleeping right now, is that, does that mean he doesn't want the money,
[12919.29s -> 12924.73s]  you think, is that legal for, maybe we'll just, okay, here, I'll tell you what we're gonna do,
[12924.73s -> 12931.45s]  okay, here's a little bit above my pay grade, I'm gonna have to go in, I think maybe what we should
[12931.45s -> 12937.05s]  do is give him some equal representation, I'm gonna call another lawyer in, okay, why don't
[12937.05s -> 12941.21s]  we do that, yeah, that sounds great, would you like a lawyer, yes, I'll call a lawyer for you,

[13209.94s -> 13213.54s]  are you going to catch me up, there's a way, you don't have to catch me up, what's going on,
[13217.54s -> 13221.62s]  I'm with this guy, this gentleman and this gentleman in the locksmith hill, sure,
[13221.62s -> 13224.90s]  yeah, I think I deserve, hey, I'm going to like that, I'll need something back,
[13226.42s -> 13229.86s]  and then how is he going to get it, if we put it back in the same, and that's like, I can tell,

[13250.10s -> 13254.18s]  about it, you type on your cell phone,
[13266.02s -> 13268.18s]  your shoes untied,
[13280.10s -> 13292.02s]  that is eating the middle, is eating the middle of bread, without eating the crust, a fucking
[13292.02s -> 13297.70s]  offendable offense, I think it is, while it is disgusting, it is not illegal, which one of you
[13297.70s -> 13302.97s]  did that, probably, if I could take a quick guess, could I see what you got in your hand there,
[13302.97s -> 13308.97s]  Mr. Locksmith, let's take a quick little look, oh mommy, cut the crust off mommy, he is a great
[13308.97s -> 13314.65s]  locksmith, he never said he knew how to cut the crust off mommy, right, cut the crust off mommy,
[13315.69s -> 13322.89s]  fucking loser, I think you should try and settle down, you should also conserve some energy,
[13322.89s -> 13328.81s]  maybe if you just had a seat, why don't we just have a seat there, hey Jerma, fuck you, how do you
[13328.81s -> 13337.45s]  know that's my name, oh god, oh lord, what was that, what was that over there, nothing wrong with
[13337.45s -> 13344.25s]  eating the middle, hello Randy, hello Randy, thank you, what was in the door, hi, who are you, Randy,
[13344.25s -> 13350.09s]  you're Randy, Stevenson, Stevenson, Stevenson and Randy, okay, is the whole family, yes,
[13350.81s -> 13357.69s]  yes, we are a family, can you tell, she's got my eyes, he's got my build and gets the beard from his
[13357.69s -> 13365.13s]  mom, come on, let me explain, let me explain, let him talk, let him explain, I came into this
[13365.13s -> 13372.97s]  household, I had no expectation of anybody, I helped the guy out, helped his whole room, I get my guy to come in,
[13372.97s -> 13380.33s]  he opens the safe, all right, he opens the safe, he has a fee, he has a fee, I charge, that is an
[13380.33s -> 13385.37s]  honorable thing, everybody knows that, he's got a fee, yeah, send him back, he called, we call a
[13385.37s -> 13390.57s]  lawyer, I don't care how much it costs, give me five grand, I don't care, ten grand, that was me,
[13390.57s -> 13397.69s]  that's fine, thank you, I tried, you got the address already, yeah, it just, just, just calls a,
[13397.69s -> 13401.21s]  calls a fucking ruckus, doesn't matter, I mean, pretty much the whole thing can be solved if you
[13401.21s -> 13407.02s]  just give me the money, that's all I'm telling you right now, what's the role in this, well, I open the
[13407.02s -> 13415.42s]  safe, sir, hey, this is my mom on the phone, okay, all right, okay, is this normal for you,
[13415.42s -> 13419.82s]  uh, no, it's all good, what's, what's the verdict here, what's going on, what's your role in all this,
[13419.82s -> 13424.78s]  so, I was the, uh, well, first of all, I'm the homeowner, yeah, let me just, quick, why is he
[13424.78s -> 13429.10s]  opening the door, I just opened the door, because I feel like it, because I want some fresh air in
[13429.10s -> 13433.42s]  my home, I'm the homeowner, the windows are just fine, sir, I don't think you want to open that,
[13433.42s -> 13439.74s]  uh, we, as, as you're, you should not do that, how about you step over here, we get this solved,
[13439.74s -> 13443.90s]  give me this, let's just do this, all right, so this, from what I understand, this large sum of
[13443.90s -> 13450.14s]  money was found in the wall, in this, on this property, and you assisted in tearing down the
[13450.14s -> 13455.18s]  wall, and you assisted in opening the security device in order to obtain the money, that's good,
[13455.18s -> 13461.02s]  okay, thank you, all right, so, here's, here's how, I, pretty much, knowing the law like I know the
[13461.02s -> 13465.42s]  law, because the law is the law, and the law is the law, this is what we are going to do, I know,
[13465.50s -> 13473.50s]  said that three times in a row, did I, did I, does that affect how, did I, three times, all right,
[13473.50s -> 13477.02s]  so, here is how, this is how we're going to distribute the money, this is how it is, now,
[13477.02s -> 13483.10s]  I believe you had some electricity stolen from you, sir, really quick, sir, I got a quick objection,
[13483.10s -> 13490.30s]  he literally, he may have just kissed a bear, that is, that is a violation in this state,
[13496.74s -> 13504.10s]  I'm allergic, I'm allergic, I'm allergic, no, I'm allergic, I've got allergies,
[13506.98s -> 13511.22s]  yes, so, this is, this is pretty much what, this is how I'm going to rule on this, all right,
[13511.22s -> 13515.62s]  so, here, here it is, did you have electricity stolen from you, absolutely, I think if we pay
[13515.62s -> 13523.14s]  you fair kilowatt hour rates, and I think time in, time in, also, you were doing some handiwork up
[13523.14s -> 13529.22s]  there, emotional damages, well, were you very happy about this, yes, okay, emotional damages,
[13529.22s -> 13535.62s]  too, I think you are, you think you're allowed that amount, where, were you, I open the safe,
[13535.62s -> 13540.26s]  were you open the safe, did you have to drive all the way over here, yeah, and did you have to use
[13540.26s -> 13544.10s]  tool time and talent, it's a pleasure to meet you, all right, you got all those things, you know what,
[13544.10s -> 13547.70s]  I think you get, you get that amount, have a good day, and you know what, that's some gorgeous hair,
[13547.70s -> 13551.46s]  go buy some more hair product, too, why don't you get that taken care of, that would be nice,

[16970.15s -> 16977.59s]  somebody owns this, okay, yeah, so technically, it's probably their house, their property,
[16978.71s -> 16983.19s]  how is that even humanly possible, I've built, this was a house that was built,
[16983.99s -> 16987.43s]  these are the county records that I've obtained, well, how long have you lived here,
[16988.07s -> 16991.83s]  a two, three weeks, not very long, not very long, are you a 985,
[16991.83s -> 16993.83s]  yeah, because I heard someone lived at 983,
[16996.31s -> 17005.99s]  okay, Jeremiah, what do you mean 983, oh, what the, I'm Ludwig, what the fuck, yes,
[17006.79s -> 17013.27s]  this entire time, well, you've been, no, no, no, no, no, we're talking, the land you built on
[17013.27s -> 17017.67s]  is 985 and maybe I passed an eye this whole time to your discrepancies,
[17018.31s -> 17025.03s]  what are you talking about, no, but after I walked in on, oh gosh, after I walked in on you
[17025.03s -> 17031.83s]  and that cretin, is he gonna be okay, well, I think he'll be fine, it's not like he can kill
[17031.83s -> 17036.23s]  himself, I don't, wait, wait, wait, come over here, I need to talk to you, show him the deed,
[17036.23s -> 17039.51s]  show me the deed, what are you talking about, I, this house has been built, I didn't, whose name
[17039.51s -> 17045.03s]  does it say there, whose house does it say, it says 983, I've been building, I'm in, I'm in
[17045.03s -> 17051.83s]  Ludwig's backyard of 983, this is, 985 does not exist, this is an official document, it's accurate,
[17052.47s -> 17056.79s]  well, how does it make any sense, you've been, Amelia, you've built on my land without asking
[17056.79s -> 17060.71s]  and I passed a blind eye because I liked you and I thought we'd get along great,
[17060.71s -> 17063.03s]  what are you talking about, how are we supposed to, how are we supposed to deal with this,
[17063.03s -> 17066.55s]  what are you talking about, you can deal with it pretty simply, deal with it pretty simply,
[17066.55s -> 17069.43s]  it's called you get out, get out of the house, it's how about you get out of my house, no,
[17069.43s -> 17075.99s]  you get out of my house, your house, look at this paper, that deed is, actually, that is a legal
[17075.99s -> 17081.03s]  document and Ludwig owns the property and the home, what the fuck are you talking about,
[17081.67s -> 17086.39s]  so you just got invited over as a party, you're my friend, the law is the law and the law is the
[17086.39s -> 17089.75s]  law, no it's not, this doesn't make any sense, how about you get the fuck out of my house,
[17090.71s -> 17098.47s]  you don't own this house, I own this land, 985 Dollhouse Way, I was having a party and I
[17098.47s -> 17102.31s]  invited everybody, actually I invited two people but you all showed up because everybody in this
[17102.31s -> 17105.35s]  neighborhood, well I thought you wanted to hang out with me, maybe apologize, everybody in this
[17105.35s -> 17109.27s]  neighborhood just cracked apparently and everyone's on drugs, first thing you said to me when I walked
[17109.27s -> 17112.87s]  in is you didn't clean the house enough, I didn't even know you were Ludwig and then you took the
[17112.87s -> 17117.51s]  mask off, does that matter, does that mean you need to treat me with respect if I'm Ludwig,
[17117.51s -> 17123.11s]  okay, it's great, sounds great, that's impossible for me to, that makes no sense,
[17123.11s -> 17128.71s]  don't log into my account, don't stream on that account either, come on let's go discuss this,
[17128.71s -> 17132.71s]  no, what do you mean evict me, I'm kicking him out of this house, no one's evicting me, this is my
[17132.71s -> 17139.99s]  property, I live here, is the sheriff here, no one's evicting me, hey I need your help, Ludwig don't
[17139.99s -> 17143.91s]  let him stream on my account please, well I'm not worried about him streaming on your account,
[17143.91s -> 17147.11s]  follow me, I got banned from, hey can you help me, I got banned from Twitch, I need some muscle,
[17147.11s -> 17150.39s]  where's the sheriff, I can represent, can you represent, yes I can represent, Stevenson, Stevenson,
[17150.39s -> 17154.63s]  Stevenson and Randy, I got banned from Twitch last weekend, I'm gonna need you to help me, I can,
[17154.63s -> 17164.55s]  could you follow me, yeah I could follow you, this is my kitchen, yeah your kitchen, oh now you feel
[17164.55s -> 17169.75s]  bad, it's my house, it's not even your house, it's my house, you built up my property and maybe if you
[17169.75s -> 17175.75s]  treated me nicer this wouldn't happen this way, I don't even know your name, oh there's the sheriff,
[17175.83s -> 17179.51s]  what do you mean the sheriff, get off me, where's my bare friend, he's the only person I like here,
[17179.51s -> 17184.15s]  well he's hopefully not here, oh that should be officer right now, thank you, it's my door,
[17184.15s -> 17190.15s]  I'll take it, yeah, oh sheriff, what are you doing, I'm trying to help, I'm, hey, but we gotta follow
[17190.15s -> 17195.43s]  the law, we gotta follow the law, he's trespassing, what's going on here, he's trespassing and I want
[17195.43s -> 17200.23s]  him out of my house, who, this guy right here, you have proof, book him, yeah I've got proof,
[17200.23s -> 17205.75s]  let me see it, right there, that is a legal document I obtained from port, well what do you
[17205.75s -> 17210.39s]  think it says, okay, I mean it says you, I, well okay, because it's my property, it's your property,
[17210.39s -> 17215.75s]  my property, listen, I'm sorry man, you gotta come with me, it's all legal, listen, it's legal,
[17215.75s -> 17220.71s]  put your hands behind your back, it's not legal, what the fuck, all right, oh I'm actually hurting
[17220.71s -> 17227.03s]  real life, there you go, that's right bear, book him too, all right, all right, you're coming with
[17227.03s -> 17233.59s]  me, all right, man, listen, all right, calm down, all right, calm down, boo, fine, I'll go, fine,
[17233.59s -> 17237.59s]  what the fuck is this, I'm so sorry about this nuisance, I'm sorry about that, come on, can you,
[17237.59s -> 17241.51s]  can you rep for me and just say, what's wrong with you, you're stealing some of the pranks,
[17242.87s -> 17246.63s]  you can keep the punch, welcome to Ludwig's dollhouse, housewarming gift,
[17251.54s -> 17254.82s]  that's a great part, it's a good time, hey, welcome to Ludwig's dollhouse,
[17254.98s -> 17263.05s]  you got him off earlier, sorry if that hurt, are you spiking the punch, all right,
[17263.77s -> 17280.12s]  you're just gonna leave after spike, thank god I'm a maid, all right, my house now, what does it
[17280.12s -> 17308.89s]  smell like cigar smoke, what the zuck happened here, oh it's terrible, should I call my own maid or am
[17308.89s -> 17321.19s]  I my own maid, why is there, okay, I imagine that doesn't belong there, all right, I'll ignore that,
[17323.19s -> 17347.34s]  it still smells like cigar smoke, god, I can't clean this, how do you even begin to clean this,
[17348.78s -> 17365.77s]  there's no trash can for giant drywall, that was covering the paint, okay, right,
[17366.65s -> 17372.42s]  clean that back up, I think the posters are sold out but we could maybe sell that one and I'll take
[17372.42s -> 17416.07s]  that cut, oh fresh baked cookies, well that's ugly, oh this is a fashionable robe, okay, it's really
[17416.07s -> 17431.40s]  wet, okay, that's kind of gross, well that's kind of gross, I'll just take the cookies and be gone,
[17431.40s -> 17441.62s]  gone, having less autonomy is just a living hell, oh now I get to make the bed, okay,
[17442.18s -> 17446.10s]  that makes a lot of sense, clean and make bed should be symbiotic,
[17447.22s -> 17458.33s]  do I have to make the piss bed or can I sleep on the children's bed, you know what the worst
[17458.33s -> 17463.85s]  kind of people are, the people who buy sequin pillows and do this, like what do you think you
[17463.85s -> 17490.76s]  are Houdini, it's just a pillow, relax, what does he even do all day, I'm not gonna bother with this
[17490.76s -> 17518.25s]  room, German must still be home, I should kick him out, oh god, smells like shit in here, right,
[17518.81s -> 17529.58s]  that's, that was the laugh track moment, maybe he had some, it's a little late, shower time, okay,
[17531.37s -> 17544.60s]  uh how would I do this, let's just, you know this is not my first time doing this live,
[17545.24s -> 17560.20s]  okay no peeping toms, you know what the worst thing you can do in a shower is, piss or shit in it,
[17560.92s -> 17568.50s]  it's like other people might use it, you know, I'll do it sometimes but still pretty deplorable
[17568.50s -> 17575.34s]  of me, you know, nothing wrong with pissing as long as you don't shit, all right, that's enough
[17575.34s -> 17591.45s]  shower, that should be, I feel clean enough, there it is, is there another maid service in this town
[17591.45s -> 17618.60s]  or am I the only maid, why are there so many stools, okay, uh what was the point of kicking out
[17618.60s -> 17625.26s]  Jerma, I have two houses now, I could have just charged him rent, I mean at the end of the day
[17625.26s -> 17632.63s]  all he asked me to do was just go on one date, it sounded like we were dating,
[17638.54s -> 17649.37s]  he deserved it, oh it's gonna be tiring, you know if someone really wanted to,
[17650.41s -> 17657.21s]  they could have me take a nice bed, I've seen how you make Jerma act, you don't have to act
[17657.21s -> 17661.61s]  the same with me, we can have a good relationship, you know, actually follow through with love
[17661.61s -> 17668.87s]  stories and not just burn them to the ground by having sex with death, just an option I guess,
[17678.63s -> 17687.19s]  what's the point of parties, it's too many people to even have a conversation with,
[17687.19s -> 17691.91s]  every conversation is dull shit, seven people told me they're gonna go to Japan but COVID hit,
[17693.16s -> 17710.98s]  I don't give a shit, maybe I should call him back sometime, I'm tired, go jogging, go jog,
[17713.03s -> 17717.77s]  so it doesn't matter who's in the titular role, people said oh no it's just because it's Jerma
[17717.77s -> 17723.66s]  that we treat him poorly, but perhaps really you just treat everyone poorly who comes into this
[17723.66s -> 17733.00s]  room, even given the pope you'd probably still make him go jogging as he's fatigued, who do you
[17733.00s -> 17743.69s]  treat nicely, oh jogging, oh hello, are you doing jumping jacks and cigar smoke, is someone ready to
[17743.69s -> 17748.81s]  get fit, are you ready to go for a run, let's jog together, okay let's go, come on,
[17749.61s -> 17755.13s]  high knees, get them up, okay, there we go, we're yummy mummies, okay, we're yummy mummies,
[17755.13s -> 17758.73s]  can we turn around, can we turn around, I'm a bit tired here, are you winded already,
[17758.73s -> 17762.41s]  I'm just a bit tired, okay let's do a cool down, come on, just maybe a cool down, you're looking
[17762.41s -> 17766.25s]  great, thank you, knees up, let's go, these are high, yummy mummies, knees are high, well I'm
[17766.57s -> 17769.05s]  getting tight in the tummies, aren't we, oh gee, oh,
[18172.65s -> 18185.78s]  yeah Christmas, this is amazing, is it even Christmas time, it hasn't even been much colder,
[18185.78s -> 18203.56s]  but this is great, wow, that doesn't seem festive, but maybe for birthdays, why are there so many
[18203.56s -> 18220.10s]  cigars, now wait a second, it feels as though it's a bit short, maybe for the previous tenant,
[18220.66s -> 18234.18s]  make sense, go back outside, go back outside, okay good, garden the flowers, I feel like I've
[18234.18s -> 18244.71s]  spent a lot of time in here, the flowers, these flowers, garden, okay, they need rich nutrients
[18245.59s -> 18258.74s]  and maybe some water, oh hey, how are you, I'm looking for, was it Jeremiah or, what was his name,
[18258.74s -> 18263.38s]  Jeremiah, what do you have there, well listen, I felt kind of bad the other day, we had a little
[18263.38s -> 18268.34s]  bit of a run around about something, I wanted to give him 100 bucks, you know, oh, you seem really
[18268.34s -> 18276.34s]  nice, did you, nice to meet you, well you know what, he just left, okay, but he said you'd stop by,
[18276.34s -> 18281.38s]  yeah, I want you to know, I really like what you did with the place out here, it looks real nice,
[18281.38s -> 18286.02s]  thank you, you picked that yourself, yeah, I would have gone taller, but you know, how about you come
[18286.02s -> 18290.02s]  in, okay, how about you come in, I mean, I didn't want to stay long, so you own the house now,
[18290.66s -> 18295.38s]  you know what, yeah, I own it, but he comes in and out, so you know, I'll just hold on to it for you,
[18295.38s -> 18301.06s]  I mean, listen, I was gonna give him 100 bucks, and listen, I'll give you, you know,
[18301.06s -> 18310.34s]  you know, okay, camo, it doesn't really work on you, because you stick out, like a sore thumb with that
[18310.98s -> 18315.62s]  okay, beautiful body of yours, I really appreciate it, I'd suggest other clothing, I am married,
[18315.62s -> 18320.10s]  okay, married to the game, I am married, so, I'm physically married, I'm just going to, yeah, I'm
[18320.10s -> 18326.26s]  gonna give that to you, well hey, you're a looker, but don't tell nobody I said that, you know,
[18327.22s -> 18335.46s]  yeah, if you're ever interested, okay, 985, 985, and 983, I actually own both, okay, yeah,
[18335.46s -> 18340.34s]  I love what you did with the place, thank you, you look great, yeah, legal dispute, hey, anytime
[18340.34s -> 18344.50s]  you need electricity, anytime you need electricity, there's an extension cord already, and I can just
[18344.50s -> 18352.50s]  use it, it's yours, okay, that's convenient, I feel like it'd be a huge headache, okay,
[18356.36s -> 18362.52s]  pee-pee, poo-poo, or eat-eat, we gotta pick one, because right now it's, well, it's a little all
[18362.52s -> 18379.53s]  over the wall, it seems gross, but they kind of look appealing, oh, clean, yeah, I'll just, this
[18379.53s -> 18385.69s]  seems to be somewhat stereotypical, feels like we could have respected maybe the job more, and
[18386.65s -> 18390.81s]  and been like, oh, maybe that's, that's, that's what they do day to day, so perhaps,
[18391.69s -> 18395.05s]  you know, they could take care of the rest of what they got going on,
[18396.01s -> 18400.57s]  but I'll clean, I'll clean, I've cleaned this place before, and do it again,
[18403.77s -> 18413.11s]  admittedly, all the utensils were me, so I can't be too upset, what is this, small pinata,
[18415.03s -> 18425.40s]  does this have actual pizza in it, what, why is it so red, how do you get pizza that red,
[18425.40s -> 18433.75s]  is it made with beets instead of tomatoes, it's so, it's a week old, why would you put,
[18435.11s -> 18440.04s]  I would have eaten that, okay, I get the white bread thing now,
[18446.87s -> 18453.19s]  there's so much alcohol, does he ever drink water, is there a way to drink water in this
[18453.19s -> 18462.86s]  house, or is it only unmarked sodas and unmarked beers, oh, sorry, I'm not allowed to do that yet,
[18462.86s -> 18469.50s]  okay, but if anyone wanted to feed me, that's what I would do, but for now, I'm staying hungry,
[18470.46s -> 18475.26s]  had someone wanted that to happen, that's what could happen, but we'll never know,
[18476.54s -> 18502.47s]  well, this room's not bad then, I'm anxious just being here, I have to work, why am I being cold
[18502.47s -> 18512.30s]  by Elvin men, I'm a maid, is this for the king, you know, it's been a pretty long day, I had a few
[18512.30s -> 18516.62s]  different things to worry about last week, I had a couple of payments that I was a little laid on,
[18516.62s -> 18520.22s]  it's been kind of a difficult time, and I'm wondering, I think looking for a rail, this is
[18520.22s -> 18525.66s]  the only job I had, this is cleaning this house, whose house am I, did I say it, oh gosh,
[18527.18s -> 18533.24s]  uh, just on my way to work, how's it going, peasant, well, good day,
[18533.88s -> 18537.40s]  Ludwig or Amelia works generally, but thank you, good day to you too,
[18590.20s -> 18620.46s]  I own two houses, it doesn't make a lot of sense to go to work,
[18621.34s -> 18625.66s]  I could just rent out a house, doesn't add a lot of value to society, but
[18626.46s -> 18637.19s]  it's a good way to accumulate wealth, but nothing over 2.6 million, that would be too much, frankly,
[18640.07s -> 18648.44s]  all right, why did I leave it open, if you leave both open, it kind of ruins the illusion,
[18648.44s -> 18658.79s]  never mind, but do people just come to my house, let me take off my work uniform,
[18663.38s -> 18672.63s]  okay, can we do one thing that's good for me, all right, shower, piss, eat, sleep, I think all of
[18672.63s -> 18681.24s]  them would be pretty helpful right now, play outside, yeah, that makes a lot of sense,
[18681.24s -> 18696.76s]  no, I have to piss, oh yeah, play outside, hey, whoa, does this get us in trouble,
[18709.30s -> 18730.12s]  oh, it's fun, good performance, can I do something good for me, I don't want to be outside,
[18730.76s -> 18741.82s]  I'll just, I'll hover near things that I would like to do, and maybe, maybe, you know, it's like a
[18741.82s -> 18764.07s]  hint, didn't close the legs then, didn't mean to do that, it's more looting, okay, there's already
[18764.07s -> 18777.38s]  a lot of piss in the bed, oh, I feel like having a bedroom through a room with a reciprocating saw
[18777.38s -> 18782.98s]  and a sledgehammer, and a knife that is far too sharp, and a bunch of broken drywall isn't the
[18782.98s -> 18804.78s]  safest way to live life, wow, look at this, maybe still available, I don't know, all right,
[19263.66s -> 19291.94s]  what are you doing in my house, you're gifting me cookies, no, stop gifting me, okay,
[19292.81s -> 19312.90s]  you didn't trap us in here, you sit on the stool, what are you doing in my home, oh yeah,
[19313.14s -> 19319.08s]  no, no, no, no, force, it's you,
[19321.88s -> 19328.34s]  you couldn't even be a proper man, a shadow boxer, you know how hard it was, to get
[19328.34s -> 19332.26s]  involved in that group, what is it like, they're auditions, what do you mean, no,
[19332.26s -> 19336.58s]  just hold on, delete, the save, delete, there's a save, file, you need to delete, we're
[19336.58s -> 19339.86s]  gonna start it over, what's, delete, the save file, we're gonna start from a new house,
