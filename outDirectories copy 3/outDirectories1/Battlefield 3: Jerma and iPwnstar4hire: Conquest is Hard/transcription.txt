[0.31s -> 13.48s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 video.
[13.48s -> 19.22s]  My first ever Battlefield 3 video and it happens to be with somebody very very special.
[19.22s -> 26.26s]  I'm playing with iPoneStar4Hire. This is all going to be a live commentary, just kind of us messing around in Conquest.
[26.26s -> 31.96s]  Just a small series of clips I put together all live, like I said, us just having a good time, messing around.
[31.96s -> 38.66s]  I'm a total noob at this game. This is like the first or second time I've actually really sat down to play the game.
[38.66s -> 43.08s]  So keep that in mind when you're watching these clips I guess.
[43.08s -> 48.21s]  The live commentary should be coming in right about now.
[48.21s -> 50.21s]  One down. Oh my god!
[50.21s -> 56.21s]  I'm just like, this is pretty much like Jerma follows PoneStar and watches him destroy everything.
[56.21s -> 59.21s]  I'm down for that. They do.
[59.91s -> 62.91s]  Whoa, is that us or is that not us?
[62.91s -> 64.91s]  I don't know.
[64.91s -> 66.91s]  That's not us, that's not us.
[66.91s -> 68.91s]  That's not us.
[68.91s -> 70.91s]  That is definitely not us.
[70.91s -> 72.91s]  I got the T-90, I don't even know what that is.
[72.91s -> 79.20s]  It's got like, pillows on the back of it.
[79.20s -> 81.20s]  Alright, do you want me to just spawn or spawn on it?
[81.20s -> 83.20s]  Spawn back to the cocktail. I'm going to fucking take that tank out.
[83.20s -> 85.20s]  He's coming behind us, behind us.
[85.20s -> 87.20s]  Oh fuck!
[87.20s -> 89.20s]  We got away.
[89.20s -> 91.20s]  He's still coming after us I think.
[91.90s -> 93.90s]  Bitch, let's go swimming.
[93.90s -> 95.90s]  Oh my god. Are we really going that way?
[95.90s -> 97.90s]  We're going swimming, man.
[97.90s -> 99.90s]  There's a letter over here, we gotta go capture our letters.
[99.90s -> 101.90s]  This game is ridiculous.
[101.90s -> 105.90s]  There's so many letters in the alphabet, I'm just used to seeing A, B, or C, or A, B.
[105.90s -> 107.90s]  They go up to F in Battlefield?
[107.90s -> 109.90s]  G? Are you kidding me?
[109.90s -> 112.08s]  That's cool.
[112.08s -> 116.08s]  You gotta go back and forth, it's like going crazy on these.
[116.08s -> 118.08s]  We start at F and we go backwards.
[118.08s -> 120.44s]  I gotcha, I gotcha.
[121.14s -> 125.14s]  I don't know how smart it is to walk prone backwards with your nuts on the concrete.
[125.14s -> 130.22s]  Should we be expecting people to come from one of these areas?
[130.22s -> 134.39s]  I don't know, I don't play Conquest.
[134.39s -> 136.39s]  I can't fly, oh fuck, what's going on?
[136.39s -> 140.39s]  I think I just stepped on a piece of wood or some bubble wrap.
[140.39s -> 142.39s]  Oh shit, it's happening again.
[142.39s -> 144.39s]  Where is he?
[144.39s -> 146.63s]  Somebody's shooting at us.
[146.63s -> 148.63s]  Dude, the bubble wrap assassin, where is he?
[149.33s -> 151.33s]  It's a sniper, it's a sniper.
[151.33s -> 155.33s]  I really am legit scared right now.
[155.33s -> 159.33s]  I'm more scared right now than I have been in Resident Evil.
[159.33s -> 161.33s]  Hold me.
[164.33s -> 168.33s]  Dude, he's gonna get one of us in a couple seconds and we're gonna be toast.
[168.33s -> 170.33s]  Oh shit.
[170.33s -> 174.33s]  Why am I shooting at it?
[174.33s -> 176.33s]  I'm just hiding.
[176.33s -> 178.33s]  Where are you?
[179.03s -> 181.03s]  I'm coming, I'm coming, hold on.
[181.03s -> 183.03s]  No, no, he got me.
[183.03s -> 185.46s]  Oh god, dude.
[185.46s -> 187.46s]  No, they're gonna take our G back.
[187.46s -> 189.46s]  No, I don't want to die.
[189.46s -> 191.46s]  Wait, it says I suicided.
[191.46s -> 193.46s]  I just got RPG'd in the water.
[193.46s -> 195.46s]  Wait, so what if I just shoot him?
[195.46s -> 200.01s]  What if I just shoot him over and over again?
[200.01s -> 202.01s]  I will save you.
[202.01s -> 204.01s]  I'm just literally firing at the tank over and over again.
[204.01s -> 206.01s]  I got my knife out, I'm gonna charge him.
[206.01s -> 208.01s]  Look here.
[208.71s -> 210.71s]  Hold on, hold on, I'm throwing a grenade.
[210.71s -> 212.71s]  Grenade, out.
[212.71s -> 214.71s]  It landed on it.
[214.71s -> 216.71s]  Imagine if it just took it out.
[216.71s -> 218.71s]  Stay alive, I'm gonna C4, I'm gonna come back in and C4 this.
[218.71s -> 221.01s]  Wait, I can revive you.
[221.01s -> 223.01s]  No, there's not enough time, I'm dead.
[223.01s -> 225.01s]  And you're about to be too.
[225.01s -> 227.01s]  I'm just gonna throw health at him.
[227.01s -> 229.01s]  You're gonna throw health at him?
[229.01s -> 231.01s]  Oh shit, I'm about to get ran over.
[231.01s -> 233.01s]  What are these guys doing?
[233.01s -> 236.66s]  Oh man, we're making the...
[236.66s -> 239.03s]  Kaboom.
[239.73s -> 241.73s]  Why am I climbing a ladder and there's nothing up here?
[241.73s -> 243.73s]  Look at this.
[243.73s -> 245.73s]  I climbed a ladder with nothing, you're climbing it too.
[245.73s -> 247.73s]  What is going on?
[247.73s -> 249.73s]  What is this?
[249.73s -> 251.73s]  Hey, the suburb.
[251.73s -> 253.73s]  Here's a little Humvee, you wanna go get in it and look like a boss?
[253.73s -> 255.73s]  Here, I'm gonna get in it and you get in it too.
[255.73s -> 257.73s]  You can drive it and cap shit.
[257.73s -> 259.73s]  Oh shit.
[259.73s -> 261.73s]  Just a good time to let you know I don't have my license.
[261.73s -> 263.73s]  So what, are we just like...
[263.73s -> 266.10s]  This is really uncomfortable.
[266.10s -> 268.10s]  I'm in the driver's seat, I look to my left, I see a flag.
[268.80s -> 270.80s]  I look to my right and all I can see is your crotch.
[270.80s -> 272.80s]  Grandpa crotch.
[272.80s -> 274.80s]  What? Yep.
[276.80s -> 279.04s]  Why are we the only one capturing flags?
[279.04s -> 281.04s]  I know, I mean really.
[281.04s -> 283.04s]  Look at the...
[283.04s -> 285.04s]  Wait, where is he?
[285.04s -> 287.04s]  I'm going the other way, I'm not going at it.
[287.04s -> 289.04s]  Look at the scoreboard.
[289.04s -> 291.04s]  Me and you are number one and two and we've done absolutely like nothing.
[291.04s -> 293.04s]  Besides like, well we took out that tank.
[293.04s -> 295.04s]  Oh shit.
[295.04s -> 297.04s]  Oh dude, it's bumper cars.
[298.04s -> 300.86s]  Oh come on.
[300.86s -> 302.86s]  Oh dude, you're gonna make me sick.
[302.86s -> 304.86s]  I got this.
[304.86s -> 308.31s]  Sit there and wait for him.
[308.31s -> 310.31s]  Wait, I'll back that ass up.
[310.31s -> 312.31s]  I don't think he's coming.
[312.31s -> 314.31s]  Are you getting points on this? Yeah, I think so.
[314.31s -> 316.31s]  I'll leave you here. Wait what?
[316.31s -> 318.31s]  Where are you going? I got you.
[318.31s -> 320.31s]  Get that guy.
[320.31s -> 322.49s]  How is he not dead?
[322.49s -> 324.49s]  I'm out of bullets.
[324.49s -> 326.49s]  Fuck you. I ran through him.
[326.49s -> 328.49s]  Oh my god.
[328.49s -> 330.49s]  Oh shit, here it is.
[330.49s -> 332.49s]  Watch this shit, yo.
[332.49s -> 334.49s]  Alright, I'm watching, let's see this.
[334.49s -> 336.49s]  Run like fuck.
[336.49s -> 338.49s]  Yeah.
[338.49s -> 340.49s]  That was awesome.
[340.49s -> 343.18s]  So where are you?
[343.18s -> 345.18s]  Where did you go?
[345.18s -> 347.18s]  You'll find me on the floor in pieces.
[347.18s -> 349.18s]  He's on a roof.
[349.18s -> 351.18s]  Who the fuck is on a roof?
[351.18s -> 353.18s]  There I come with the paddles.
[353.18s -> 355.18s]  You got enough? You got enough time? Hurry up.
[355.18s -> 357.18s]  Oh shit, he's on this roof up here.
[357.18s -> 359.18s]  There he is.
[359.18s -> 361.18s]  Smoke him.
[361.18s -> 363.18s]  Suck it big boy.
[363.18s -> 365.18s]  Up here they're taking our D flag.
[365.18s -> 367.54s]  Not for long.
[367.54s -> 369.54s]  I hear big guns. I don't know if that's ours or theirs.
[369.54s -> 371.54s]  I think we have a tank now.
[371.54s -> 373.54s]  I don't know if that's particularly ours.
[373.54s -> 375.54s]  Shoot the guy in the gunner seat.
[375.54s -> 377.54s]  Don't lure him.
[377.54s -> 379.54s]  He's dead. The guy in the gunner seat is dead.
[384.68s -> 386.68s]  Oh man.
[386.68s -> 388.68s]  That was awesome.
[388.68s -> 390.68s]  Where's my body?
[390.68s -> 392.68s]  Oh my god, Jesus.
[392.68s -> 396.68s]  You fell with the rail with your face first and grinded that shit.
[396.68s -> 400.68s]  Dude, that was like a montage worthy clip right there that you just did.
[410.31s -> 413.06s]  That is going to wrap up this video guys.
[413.06s -> 415.06s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[415.06s -> 417.06s]  I really do appreciate it.
[417.06s -> 419.06s]  Hopefully in the next couple of weeks I can get better at Battlefield 3.
[419.06s -> 421.06s]  But yeah, we'll see where that goes.
[421.06s -> 423.06s]  Take care everybody.
[423.06s -> 425.06s]  I will see you all soon.
