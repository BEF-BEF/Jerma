[1.02s -> 13.30s]  Hello. Hi everybody. I'm just realizing right now that this, for some reason, why is this not working?
[13.30s -> 28.66s]  My Monster Rancher 4 disc is for some reason not reading now. That's weird. Hold on.
[28.66s -> 32.66s]  Let's hope that doesn't cause a problem, otherwise we're gonna have to do something else. That's not good.
[32.66s -> 38.23s]  It was working before. Let's see.
[38.23s -> 42.23s]  Hello. Let's watch with me here. Let's see what happens.
[42.23s -> 49.46s]  But, hope you had a good couple of days. There it is. Okay.
[49.46s -> 59.40s]  But, here we are. Alright. Okay. That was weird.
[59.40s -> 64.40s]  Monster Rancher 4 tonight. We played Monster Rancher 3. It wasn't that good.
[64.40s -> 73.97s]  And there's apparently an animated intro to this game.
[73.97s -> 83.03s]  Don't ask me why this is here, but okay.
[83.03s -> 88.87s]  Didn't they make a TV show on this game? They made like a whole television franchise.
[88.87s -> 98.34s]  Is this just a giant ad for the show?
[98.34s -> 105.72s]  It started as a TV show. What? How come there's no audio?
[105.72s -> 115.45s]  Oh god, you're playing the bad one. The last one was the bad one.
[115.45s -> 121.80s]  I thought EVO was the bad one. Is there only one good one?
[121.80s -> 133.93s]  I was told that EVO was the bad one, 3 was the bad one, 4 is apparently the bad one.
[133.93s -> 141.67s]  Oh, that's Captain Hook Sonic! Am I gonna get flags for this?
[141.67s -> 155.30s]  I hope not. No, I'm not. This is just a simple introduction.
[155.30s -> 159.08s]  This is the intro of the stream.
[159.08s -> 164.24s]  Alright, but while you watch this, I'm gonna tweet this stream.
[164.24s -> 170.38s]  I can't even do that with this lingering cough.
[170.38s -> 178.27s]  I've made this noise before. I've made this song before, probably.
[178.27s -> 187.85s]  Hey, that's Monster Rancher 4. 2003.
[187.85s -> 197.46s]  Why does it look so JPGE? That's because it's old and it's being pulled through a device.
[197.46s -> 204.21s]  But, this is what we're gonna try to do today.
[204.21s -> 213.72s]  And I did say that if the game is terrible, I do have a solution.
[213.72s -> 216.90s]  Okay, that's tweeted.
[216.90s -> 222.54s]  I have a solution for if this game is very bad.
[222.54s -> 226.54s]  Am I emulating? No, I am not. This is real hardware. I'm a real hardware streamer.
[226.54s -> 235.79s]  New game versus mode option. Let's see what's in here.
[235.79s -> 240.93s]  Alright, come on. Can we listen to some of the sounds?
[240.93s -> 243.93s]  No.
[243.93s -> 249.73s]  75. Don't ever have background music the same.
[249.73s -> 260.20s]  If the game is bad, Google Feud. No, if the game is bad, we're going to Mr. Mosquito.
[260.20s -> 267.62s]  And that was hard to track down.
[267.62s -> 272.19s]  Monster Rancher 4. Here we go.
[272.19s -> 275.19s]  A long time ago, people and monsters lived in harmony.
[275.19s -> 282.03s]  But eventually, humans sealed the monsters inside tablets called saucer stones.
[282.03s -> 284.34s]  This is the intro to Undertale.
[298.35s -> 302.10s]  Those are discs, if you don't know. And I got plenty of them here.
[302.10s -> 307.10s]  The people are entertained by monster battles and the breeders who raise the monsters are heroes.
[307.10s -> 310.54s]  Weird.
[310.54s -> 315.54s]  The capital of the country is Toggle, a place far from Ruin.
[315.54s -> 317.54s]  That's the name of my town.
[317.54s -> 322.32s]  A boat from Age Island brought you here.
[322.32s -> 325.07s]  And that's how it all started.
[325.07s -> 330.11s]  And then she got snapped.
[330.11s -> 337.55s]  Get your butt out of here, you sneaky little rat.
[337.55s -> 340.30s]  This is TT.
[340.30s -> 344.31s]  Yowchoo, what are you doing? What did I do wrong?
[344.31s -> 347.13s]  Why, you have some nerve.
[347.13s -> 351.52s]  Sneaking in and sleeping in a stranger's bed.
[351.52s -> 357.41s]  Don't you play innocent with me.
[357.41s -> 360.08s]  Uh, what the fuck?
[360.08s -> 365.50s]  I didn't come into this stuffy room because I wanted to.
[365.50s -> 369.31s]  Huh? Boy, you really do have a lot of nerve.
[369.31s -> 371.31s]  What the fuck is happening here?
[371.31s -> 373.74s]  Excuse me, you two.
[373.74s -> 376.05s]  Huh? Well, what is it?
[376.05s -> 379.22s]  My name is Caesar and I'm from a nearby shrine.
[379.22s -> 381.22s]  If it's okay, I'd like to take care of that boy.
[381.22s -> 386.77s]  Huh, you're a big wig in this town. Well, good timing.
[386.77s -> 389.33s]  This brat broke into here.
[389.33s -> 391.33s]  He needs to be thrown into jail, I tell ya.
[391.33s -> 394.34s]  I trust you'll take care of this.
[394.34s -> 397.86s]  Oh, boy, and off she goes.
[397.86s -> 399.86s]  That young girl doesn't have a sharp tongue.
[399.86s -> 402.99s]  Yeah, I bet she scares all the boys away.
[402.99s -> 404.99s]  Well, good night, mister.
[404.99s -> 408.06s]  Zzz, I fell asleep immediately.
[408.06s -> 412.16s]  God, to have that power.
[412.16s -> 416.74s]  Sometimes I sit in bed and try to sleep for like four straight hours.
[416.74s -> 418.74s]  You know what superpowers people talk about they wish they had?
[418.74s -> 421.05s]  If you had a superpower, what would it be?
[421.05s -> 423.35s]  I would fly.
[423.35s -> 426.42s]  No, fuck that.
[426.42s -> 428.92s]  I think it would be fun to be invisible.
[428.92s -> 430.92s]  No, that's stupid.
[430.92s -> 435.53s]  I'd like to be able to fall asleep whenever I wanted to and go into REM sleep.
[435.53s -> 441.35s]  Now that's a good superpower.
[441.35s -> 443.35s]  Oh, boy, they're so already asleep, huh?
[443.35s -> 446.42s]  What's this? The boy's bag.
[446.42s -> 450.33s]  Looks rifled through it.
[450.33s -> 452.33s]  What an odd intro. Is this anime like this?
[452.33s -> 454.33s]  Are these characters from the TV show?
[454.33s -> 457.46s]  Hmm. Where am I?
[457.46s -> 459.46s]  What? My bag. The saucer stones.
[459.46s -> 462.71s]  Eek.
[462.71s -> 464.71s]  Sorry, have you seen my bag?
[464.71s -> 466.71s]  So he... I don't understand
[466.71s -> 468.71s]  what happened in the first five minutes of this game.
[468.71s -> 473.38s]  He broke into somebody's house,
[473.38s -> 475.38s]  fell asleep instantly,
[475.38s -> 478.78s]  and then an old person stole his bag.
[478.78s -> 480.78s]  I don't know what's going on.
[480.78s -> 483.40s]  Hmm, err, your bag.
[483.40s -> 485.40s]  Don't be alarmed, your bag and the saucer stones
[485.40s -> 487.70s]  are right here.
[487.70s -> 489.70s]  Did you know this girl worried about you
[489.70s -> 492.20s]  and stayed by your side this whole time?
[492.20s -> 494.95s]  Maybe a thanks is in order.
[494.95s -> 496.95s]  This girl, Rio, she's my daughter.
[496.95s -> 501.05s]  She did that for me? Thanks, Rio.
[501.05s -> 504.81s]  Oh, sure.
[504.81s -> 506.81s]  If I may ask, does this bag mean
[506.81s -> 509.82s]  that you're a student at Elvis School?
[509.82s -> 511.82s]  The elite school that trains top breeders?
[511.82s -> 513.82s]  To move their hips back and forth
[513.82s -> 516.82s]  real fast?
[516.82s -> 518.82s]  No, I used to be a student, but I was expelled.
[518.82s -> 523.94s]  I hate this.
[523.94s -> 525.94s]  This is fucking stupid.
[525.94s -> 527.94s]  What did you get expelled for?
[527.94s -> 532.28s]  No.
[532.28s -> 534.28s]  General lied about Minecraft VR thanks to the five community subs.
[534.28s -> 538.68s]  Thank you.
[538.68s -> 540.68s]  I see. You couldn't face your parents,
[540.68s -> 542.68s]  so you snuck onto the ship.
[542.68s -> 545.75s]  I can't say that I approve of that, lad.
[545.75s -> 548.50s]  No, I don't have any parents.
[548.50s -> 550.50s]  I had nowhere to go, and I just didn't know
[550.50s -> 553.70s]  what to do, so I came here.
[553.70s -> 555.70s]  What do you mean you don't have any?
[555.70s -> 560.31s]  What? Like, does he mean ever?
[560.31s -> 564.41s]  Kazzie, thanks for the five community subs.
[564.41s -> 570.81s]  Oh, yeah,
[570.81s -> 574.07s]  he's got his parents.
[574.07s -> 579.69s]  You have to watch
[579.69s -> 581.69s]  this show for one anime a year.
[581.69s -> 583.69s]  No, I don't think
[583.69s -> 585.69s]  I'm going to do that, but thank you Kazzie,
[585.69s -> 587.69s]  and thank you Peek-A-Banana for five community subs.
[587.69s -> 589.69s]  Fifteen community subs right off the bat here. Thank you, guys.
[589.69s -> 593.06s]  I can't help what happened.
[593.06s -> 595.06s]  To be honest, I hardly care about being
[595.06s -> 597.62s]  expelled anymore.
[597.62s -> 599.62s]  I see. Sorry if I mentioned
[599.62s -> 601.93s]  parents at all.
[601.93s -> 603.93s]  What is going on here? General lied about Minecraft VR.
[603.93s -> 606.23s]  Five more community subs.
[606.23s -> 609.88s]  Damn. Thank you, guys.
[609.88s -> 612.63s]  That's twenty now. Back to back.
[612.63s -> 619.16s]  Holy Jesus. Thank you, guys.
[619.16s -> 621.98s]  I'm sorry I mentioned parents at all.
[621.98s -> 624.79s]  I have an idea. Why don't you work here?
[624.79s -> 626.79s]  I'm looking for somebody to look after some
[626.79s -> 629.74s]  vacant land. You're not doing
[629.74s -> 631.74s]  any good just hanging around, so how about it?
[631.74s -> 633.74s]  You could even raise some monsters.
[633.74s -> 636.30s]  Raise monsters?
[636.30s -> 638.30s]  You mean you'd let me run a ranch?
[638.30s -> 640.79s]  You just met me and you'd let me do that?
[640.79s -> 643.80s]  Well, nothing big time,
[643.80s -> 646.36s]  but a ranch nonetheless.
[646.36s -> 648.36s]  Now I don't know what you did to get expelled,
[648.36s -> 650.36s]  but I'm sure you had your reasons.
[650.36s -> 653.69s]  This guy's messed up.
[653.69s -> 656.76s]  What do you know what he did?
[656.76s -> 658.76s]  You had your reasons to get expelled from school.
[658.76s -> 662.60s]  But there's no point in giving up your dream now.
[662.60s -> 664.90s]  So what it'll be.
[664.90s -> 667.78s]  Let's see. What's your name?
[671.78s -> 674.28s]  Fane.
[674.28s -> 679.53s]  That is too many
[679.53s -> 684.14s]  ways. That's too much.
[684.14s -> 686.44s]  Fane. I don't think I want to change that.
[686.44s -> 689.51s]  That seems pretty canon to me.
[689.51s -> 692.65s]  Fane? P-H-A-Y-N-E.
[692.65s -> 697.06s]  That's canon.
[697.06s -> 710.10s]  I can't change it. Yeah.
[710.10s -> 712.10s]  Fane. My name is Fane.
[712.10s -> 714.10s]  This is just like a live journal username.
[714.10s -> 718.78s]  Thank you Magellan for the
[718.78s -> 724.66s]  five community subs. Thank you guys.
[724.66s -> 727.10s]  Of course. I accept.
[727.10s -> 729.59s]  Thanks Mr. Caesar.
[729.59s -> 731.59s]  Now let's settle then. You can use this
[731.59s -> 733.59s]  saucer stone to regenerate monsters.
[733.59s -> 735.59s]  Okay, let's head to the shrine.
[735.59s -> 738.22s]  First monster. Here we go.
[738.22s -> 742.06s]  You can regenerate saucer stones in this
[742.06s -> 744.06s]  shrine. Is this your first visit to a
[744.06s -> 746.87s]  real shrine, Fane?
[746.87s -> 748.87s]  This time we'll regenerate from this saucer stone.
[748.87s -> 750.87s]  But if you find any others, bring them over.
[750.87s -> 754.97s]  As long as you have room to raise
[754.97s -> 756.97s]  more monsters, you can regenerate them
[756.97s -> 759.98s]  any time you like. Why do you have
[759.98s -> 764.01s]  red eyes? This is the adult
[764.01s -> 767.66s]  version of Annabelle.
[767.66s -> 769.66s]  This is like Annabelle grew up
[769.66s -> 771.66s]  to like a late teenager.
[771.66s -> 777.72s]  We're in the same clothes. Is this
[777.72s -> 789.82s]  the same character? Yeah.
[789.82s -> 795.50s]  It is. It's just
[795.50s -> 797.50s]  a little bit different color scheme.
[797.50s -> 799.99s]  As long as you have room to raise more monsters,
[799.99s -> 801.99s]  you can generate them. Yeah.
[801.99s -> 804.23s]  Now Fane, let the regeneration
[804.23s -> 808.14s]  begin. So I get one for free
[808.14s -> 810.50s]  or do I have to put a disk in? So those
[810.50s -> 812.50s]  of you that have no idea what's going on in the game, let me try
[812.50s -> 814.50s]  to explain.
[814.50s -> 817.32s]  This is a game where you battle monsters.
[817.32s -> 819.32s]  And you get the monsters by
[819.32s -> 821.32s]  putting in any disk you have in your
[821.32s -> 823.32s]  house. And it generates a random
[823.32s -> 825.32s]  seed for that disk.
[825.32s -> 832.02s]  And you get a monster. So this
[832.02s -> 834.02s]  is your first monster. Okay, let's have you give it a
[834.02s -> 836.33s]  name. That's the first
[836.33s -> 838.33s]  monster?
[838.33s -> 841.21s]  I don't want this like default
[841.21s -> 843.21s]  dickhead. I want my own.
[843.21s -> 849.21s]  It's just like, that's like
[849.21s -> 851.21s]  what a mouse design would look like
[851.21s -> 853.21s]  if it was a Disney Pixar movie.
[856.09s -> 858.09s]  Isn't there already like a Disney Pixar
[858.09s -> 862.63s]  like rat mouse?
[862.63s -> 864.63s]  It's like, I don't know. How about
[864.63s -> 866.63s]  Mawaz?
[868.63s -> 876.70s]  That's a wonderful
[876.70s -> 878.70s]  name. Give it all your love
[878.70s -> 881.83s]  to Mawaz. Now,
[881.83s -> 883.83s]  take Fane to that empty plot of land.
[893.42s -> 896.17s]  I want that thing. What do I get like
[896.17s -> 898.17s]  the baby King Dedede from?
[898.17s -> 906.02s]  We're here. Wow, it's huge and
[906.02s -> 908.71s]  so mysterious. This is just
[908.71s -> 911.53s]  awesome, huh Rio? Wait,
[911.53s -> 913.53s]  I hear a voice from over there. Who could it be?
[913.53s -> 916.66s]  Shoot, wait up, wait up, I tell ya.
[919.86s -> 922.62s]  Finally. I got
[922.62s -> 924.62s]  up. Are you the boy named Fane?
[924.62s -> 928.46s]  Yes, who are you?
[928.46s -> 932.34s]  My name is Yuri.
[932.34s -> 935.86s]  Caesar told me to come and help you.
[935.86s -> 938.81s]  I work at the item shop, but
[938.81s -> 940.81s]  I always wanted to try being a ranch assistant.
[940.81s -> 943.94s]  So I look forward to working with you,
[943.94s -> 945.94s]  Fane. Let's do some good work together.
[945.94s -> 948.44s]  Sure, Yuri, let's
[948.44s -> 950.81s]  uh, it's time
[950.81s -> 954.26s]  for me to go home. Hey Rio, she's
[954.26s -> 956.82s]  gone. Anyway, let's do some good
[956.82s -> 958.82s]  work. I might not look it, but I've done my
[958.82s -> 962.34s]  homework. You can count on me.
[962.34s -> 967.59s]  Okay, first, let's go over the ranch basics.
[967.59s -> 970.79s]  Clean out your ears
[970.79s -> 973.74s]  and listen up carefully. At the beginning
[973.74s -> 975.74s]  of the week, you create a schedule.
[975.74s -> 978.68s]  Oh no, I'm not very
[978.68s -> 980.68s]  good with those. Schedule training
[980.68s -> 982.68s]  to strengthen your monster. Can I have no schedule?
[982.68s -> 984.68s]  I work way better on no schedule.
[984.68s -> 989.16s]  And schedule breaks to let your monster
[989.16s -> 991.98s]  rest. You can schedule up to
[991.98s -> 993.98s]  eight weeks in advance. Use
[993.98s -> 995.98s]  this to create a long term plan.
[995.98s -> 998.86s]  I'm going on like a diet,
[998.86s -> 1000.86s]  apparently. Okay, so then select
[1000.86s -> 1002.86s]  the training type and time,
[1002.86s -> 1004.86s]  then free time to play with your monster.
[1004.86s -> 1008.06s]  By playing with the monster here, the monsters
[1008.06s -> 1010.06s]  bond with you will strengthen.
[1010.06s -> 1013.58s]  We're playing like busy dad simulator.
[1013.58s -> 1015.94s]  I gotta ride in an hour
[1015.94s -> 1017.94s]  to throw the ball around with my son.
[1017.94s -> 1020.38s]  Praise monsters when they do a good job
[1020.38s -> 1022.38s]  to further strengthen your mutual bond.
[1022.38s -> 1025.58s]  And if a monster is not doing what it should,
[1025.58s -> 1028.39s]  then it's time for a discipline.
[1028.39s -> 1032.17s]  Lazy monsters must be brought into
[1032.17s -> 1034.34s]  line. Love is both carrot
[1034.34s -> 1036.34s]  and stick, and this also increases
[1036.34s -> 1038.78s]  bonding. Use your best judgment
[1038.78s -> 1040.78s]  and take advantage of free time as an
[1040.78s -> 1042.78s]  opportunity to raise the level of bonding.
[1042.78s -> 1045.78s]  Lastly, rest on weekends until you get used
[1045.78s -> 1048.02s]  to things. Later you can enter
[1048.02s -> 1050.02s]  competition and shop in town.
[1050.02s -> 1052.65s]  Well, that's a typical week on the ranch. The rest
[1052.65s -> 1055.98s]  you'll learn as you go. Well, what do you think?
[1055.98s -> 1057.98s]  Did you understand? Yeah, you schedule
[1057.98s -> 1061.05s]  out everything. You schedule rest,
[1061.05s -> 1063.05s]  schedule training, schedule playtime.
[1063.05s -> 1066.06s]  I think I get it. Kind of.
[1066.06s -> 1069.75s]  Maybe, probably not though. Good, you're a great partner.
[1069.75s -> 1075.45s]  Well, let's give it our best then.
[1075.45s -> 1077.45s]  Year one, month four,
[1077.45s -> 1079.45s]  week one, schedule.
[1079.45s -> 1081.45s]  Alright, so we got data, command,
[1081.45s -> 1083.45s]  training, schedule, shrine, system,
[1083.45s -> 1085.94s]  mows is very lively.
[1085.94s -> 1089.51s]  Let's go to schedule. So this is
[1089.51s -> 1091.69s]  year, this is one, this is the first
[1091.69s -> 1094.06s]  week. So week, we're gonna do
[1094.06s -> 1098.41s]  training. Uh, I need to see,
[1098.41s -> 1100.41s]  wait, what are you, the monster plans its own training
[1100.41s -> 1103.10s]  to raise strength. No, no, no, go back.
[1103.10s -> 1106.23s]  What, what does this guy even have his stats?
[1106.23s -> 1111.03s]  How do I see his stats? Data.
[1111.03s -> 1115.37s]  Monster, okay. So, power,
[1115.37s -> 1118.81s]  life, high power.
[1118.81s -> 1123.42s]  Uh, for one second, I don't know, my brain
[1123.42s -> 1125.42s]  just didn't understand. I thought that said
[1125.42s -> 1127.66s]  Oyoromo. I was like,
[1127.66s -> 1129.66s]  what's that, what name is that? I didn't
[1129.66s -> 1133.50s]  give him the name Oyoromo. Yeah,
[1133.50s -> 1135.74s]  pretty dumb, but it looks like,
[1135.74s -> 1138.49s]  what do you got for moves? Skills. Hmm.
[1138.49s -> 1142.26s]  So this is wild slash.
[1142.26s -> 1145.91s]  This is a power move. This is an
[1145.91s -> 1147.91s]  intelligence move for somebody with 85 intelligence.
[1147.91s -> 1150.92s]  Sounds pretty terrible. And then fire
[1150.92s -> 1156.86s]  charge. Okay. So
[1156.86s -> 1159.10s]  I think we're gonna work on power. And
[1159.10s -> 1161.10s]  what, this is also power, right?
[1161.10s -> 1164.74s]  Yeah, power. I can barely
[1164.74s -> 1166.74s]  read those numbers.
[1166.74s -> 1171.54s]  Yeah, they're a little crusty, aren't they?
[1171.54s -> 1173.54s]  Let's go to the shrine. Let's do the thing that we're supposed
[1173.54s -> 1176.87s]  to be doing, first of all. I don't know if I like
[1176.87s -> 1181.22s]  this guy. Well, hello, everything going well.
[1181.22s -> 1184.34s]  So what will it be? Okay.
[1184.34s -> 1186.97s]  Let's create. You already
[1186.97s -> 1188.97s]  have a monster you're, you already have a monster
[1188.97s -> 1192.47s]  you're raising. So what will it be?
[1192.47s -> 1196.63s]  Uh, do I have to, like, freeze him? Come again
[1196.63s -> 1199.90s]  anytime. I don't know if it was like the other games.
[1199.90s -> 1203.80s]  Put in, I got, oh, I got lots of stuff here,
[1203.80s -> 1207.45s]  don't worry. Uh, so,
[1207.45s -> 1211.86s]  how do I freeze him? Shrine system?
[1211.86s -> 1219.86s]  Holy shit, that actually is fireman.
[1219.86s -> 1225.56s]  Like, I could, I should have named it fireman.
[1225.56s -> 1232.47s]  It sort of is, with the big groucho
[1232.47s -> 1234.47s]  marks eyebrows. Alright, so how do I, um,
[1234.47s -> 1237.35s]  how do I do that?
[1237.35s -> 1248.09s]  Appraise? Maybe he can, like,
[1248.09s -> 1250.71s]  just a moment, feign. You don't have a saucer stone.
[1250.71s -> 1253.78s]  There's nothing to appraise without a saucer
[1253.78s -> 1258.46s]  stone. It's too late to kill
[1258.46s -> 1260.76s]  it. I'm not trying to kill it, I'm just
[1260.76s -> 1268.18s]  trying to store it.
[1268.18s -> 1270.18s]  Walmart brand
[1270.18s -> 1272.18s]  salamander.
[1272.18s -> 1274.18s]  Walmart brand charmander.
[1274.18s -> 1280.20s]  Alright, I don't, I don't think
[1280.20s -> 1284.55s]  I can fucking freeze him.
[1284.55s -> 1286.55s]  Schedule. Could I, like, schedule him to be put on
[1286.55s -> 1293.91s]  ice? System.
[1293.91s -> 1295.91s]  Save. Versus
[1295.91s -> 1298.92s]  data? Let's just save the game.
[1298.92s -> 1303.91s]  Schedule him to die.
[1303.91s -> 1312.23s]  Release him
[1312.23s -> 1314.23s]  into the wild. He's like a baby.
[1314.23s -> 1317.18s]  Alright, I think, I don't think I can do this
[1317.18s -> 1319.18s]  yet. I think we just have to play with, um, I don't even
[1319.18s -> 1321.18s]  know his name, mouse. Let's log,
[1321.18s -> 1323.42s]  okay, schedule. Training.
[1323.42s -> 1325.42s]  We're gonna do
[1325.42s -> 1328.42s]  power training, this is exercise,
[1328.42s -> 1331.10s]  and then let's
[1331.10s -> 1333.10s]  do a little bit of more
[1333.10s -> 1335.10s]  training the next day.
[1335.10s -> 1337.10s]  And then we're gonna rest, and then we're
[1337.10s -> 1339.78s]  gonna do rest, and then
[1339.78s -> 1343.30s]  what about, like, how do I do a play
[1343.30s -> 1347.46s]  date? No, not all training.
[1347.46s -> 1352.84s]  He's gonna die.
[1352.84s -> 1356.55s]  Automatic.
[1356.55s -> 1359.50s]  Maybe his exercise
[1359.50s -> 1361.50s]  high jump. Balance.
[1361.50s -> 1363.50s]  Let's do balance.
[1363.50s -> 1365.50s]  Okay.
[1365.50s -> 1367.50s]  So now, let's go back.
[1367.50s -> 1369.80s]  And just, let's go.
[1369.80s -> 1371.80s]  Let's, let's do it.
[1371.80s -> 1373.80s]  How do I, like, play out my
[1373.80s -> 1375.80s]  baseball season that I made?
[1375.80s -> 1380.58s]  Do I have to do it all?
[1380.58s -> 1382.58s]  Okay, submenu.
[1382.58s -> 1388.79s]  I guess we have to block this all out. Alright,
[1388.79s -> 1390.79s]  balance, that will rest, and we'll do
[1390.79s -> 1392.79s]  two weeks in a row. Of power.
[1392.79s -> 1397.34s]  And then rest again.
[1397.34s -> 1399.34s]  Okay. Let's go.
[1399.34s -> 1406.57s]  Command.
[1406.57s -> 1409.69s]  I command you to do something.
[1409.69s -> 1412.31s]  Begin the training. I guess.
[1412.31s -> 1416.54s]  Alright, so power.
[1416.54s -> 1424.07s]  Plus six.
[1424.07s -> 1426.07s]  What is he doing? He's just doing sit-ups
[1426.07s -> 1433.18s]  in front of the house. Free
[1433.18s -> 1436.82s]  time. I can actually walk
[1436.82s -> 1448.33s]  around?
[1448.33s -> 1450.33s]  Command.
[1450.33s -> 1453.91s]  Weekend. Book, belongings,
[1453.91s -> 1455.91s]  what do I do with them? Praise.
[1455.91s -> 1458.22s]  Okay. I'm assuming the, what's the
[1458.22s -> 1471.91s]  second button? I'm not gonna skull
[1471.91s -> 1474.92s]  them, he didn't do anything wrong.
[1474.92s -> 1476.92s]  Alright, let's see. Command. Schedule. What about
[1476.92s -> 1478.92s]  data? Breeder, belongings.
[1478.92s -> 1480.92s]  Okay, so circle is how you get to, like, your
[1480.92s -> 1482.92s]  inventory. Proceed to weekend
[1482.92s -> 1486.38s]  activities. Not yet. Hold on.
[1486.38s -> 1489.00s]  Schedule. Exercise.
[1489.00s -> 1492.46s]  Exercise. No. Alright, it just plays
[1492.46s -> 1498.73s]  out, no matter what you do. Cannot
[1498.73s -> 1500.73s]  do anymore. I cannot praise him again.
[1500.73s -> 1505.38s]  Alright, well how do I play with him?
[1505.38s -> 1509.74s]  There's no play? Does he do anything else
[1509.74s -> 1513.64s]  besides sit-ups? Alright, well let's just move
[1513.64s -> 1517.03s]  on. Proceed to the weekend activities.
[1517.03s -> 1521.90s]  Yes. Town.
[1521.90s -> 1523.90s]  Go to town next week. Do nothing
[1523.90s -> 1525.90s]  and proceed directly to the next week. What do you mean
[1525.90s -> 1529.80s]  go to town?
[1529.80s -> 1531.80s]  Hometown. The shrine overlooks the association
[1531.80s -> 1533.80s]  and other shops and port.
[1533.80s -> 1537.13s]  Let's go to town together.
[1537.13s -> 1546.22s]  Dude, that's like a triple
[1546.22s -> 1548.46s]  room right there.
[1548.46s -> 1550.46s]  These motherfuckers, I swear to God.
[1550.46s -> 1557.22s]  Alright, so let's try.
[1557.22s -> 1560.30s]  Well, hello, everything going well?
[1560.30s -> 1562.30s]  What'll it be?
[1562.30s -> 1565.93s]  I guess.
[1565.93s -> 1570.47s]  I don't think I got, I haven't unlocked
[1570.47s -> 1572.47s]  anything else besides the first town
[1572.47s -> 1578.87s]  in Chrono Trigger.
[1578.87s -> 1587.58s]  There's nothing I can do. Well, that was fun.
[1587.58s -> 1590.52s]  April, week two in spring.
[1590.52s -> 1592.52s]  Hello, I heard that you're going to start
[1592.52s -> 1594.52s]  a new monster ranch in this area.
[1594.52s -> 1596.52s]  My name is Cynthia. I do
[1596.52s -> 1598.52s]  registration for the Toggle Monster Association.
[1598.52s -> 1600.89s]  Nice to meet you. The association oversees
[1600.89s -> 1602.89s]  the various ranches. I'm in charge of Toggle.
[1602.89s -> 1605.13s]  First, register the
[1605.13s -> 1607.13s]  name of your ranch at the association.
[1607.13s -> 1609.43s]  Okay. Here's how you do it. First,
[1609.43s -> 1611.43s]  select a symbol for your ranch, then select
[1611.43s -> 1613.93s]  a name. The name of your ranch becomes
[1613.93s -> 1615.93s]  permanent, so make sure you think of a good one.
[1615.93s -> 1620.60s]  Wait,
[1620.60s -> 1622.60s]  it's predictive text.
[1622.60s -> 1624.60s]  Farm the...
[1624.60s -> 1627.03s]  Is it, wait.
[1627.03s -> 1630.81s]  Farm street? The...
[1630.81s -> 1632.81s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. What?
[1632.81s -> 1636.20s]  The park. Farm park.
[1636.20s -> 1638.76s]  Ranch school. I don't know what
[1638.76s -> 1640.76s]  this is trying to get me to do.
[1640.76s -> 1642.76s]  Club great.
[1642.76s -> 1644.76s]  Club new. Team
[1644.76s -> 1647.70s]  the.
[1647.70s -> 1654.49s]  Street cape.
[1654.49s -> 1656.49s]  How about club cape?
[1656.49s -> 1659.82s]  The club.
[1659.82s -> 1661.82s]  New team.
[1661.82s -> 1666.30s]  Ranch school.
[1666.30s -> 1669.37s]  I kind of like ranch school. How about
[1669.37s -> 1671.37s]  ranch yard?
[1671.37s -> 1673.67s]  Ranchdom?
[1673.67s -> 1688.25s]  Ranchdom.
[1688.25s -> 1690.25s]  Dom club.
[1690.25s -> 1692.81s]  Dom land.
[1692.81s -> 1695.94s]  Club
[1695.94s -> 1698.18s]  ranch.
[1698.18s -> 1700.62s]  I don't know. These are all too good.
[1700.62s -> 1702.62s]  Farm street is also really good too.
[1702.62s -> 1705.56s]  New
[1705.56s -> 1707.56s]  street. Oh, I'm gonna have to just close
[1707.56s -> 1714.66s]  my eyes.
[1714.66s -> 1716.66s]  Ranch club. Ranch town.
[1716.66s -> 1718.66s]  Ranch cape. Land school.
[1722.89s -> 1724.89s]  Land school.
[1724.89s -> 1731.99s]  What? No, no.
[1731.99s -> 1735.13s]  I want it to be land school.
[1735.13s -> 1737.13s]  It's permanent. I can't change this.
[1737.13s -> 1741.14s]  There is no going back.
[1741.14s -> 1751.70s]  Actually isn't.
[1751.70s -> 1753.70s]  This is such shit. This is the worst.
[1753.70s -> 1763.50s]  It has to be this.
[1763.50s -> 1765.80s]  School land.
[1765.80s -> 1767.80s]  Do your best.
[1767.80s -> 1769.80s]  I'm rooting for you.
[1769.80s -> 1771.80s]  That's fucking terrible.
[1771.80s -> 1781.66s]  Such a dumbass.
[1781.66s -> 1784.15s]  Look.
[1784.15s -> 1786.15s]  School land is good for me.
[1786.15s -> 1788.15s]  That would be a terrible Disney park.
[1788.15s -> 1790.15s]  I can't restart. She told me.
[1790.15s -> 1792.90s]  No restart.
[1792.90s -> 1794.90s]  He was expelled from school.
[1794.90s -> 1796.90s]  So he made his own school
[1796.90s -> 1798.90s]  land.
[1798.90s -> 1800.90s]  That's fucking funny.
[1800.90s -> 1805.19s]  Alright, let's go.
[1805.19s -> 1811.72s]  You guys are killing me.
[1811.72s -> 1815.22s]  Is that level 10?
[1815.22s -> 1817.22s]  I'm at 88% success rate.
[1817.22s -> 1819.22s]  88%. 9 power. That's pretty good.
[1819.22s -> 1829.59s]  I don't know
[1829.59s -> 1832.15s]  what these bars even mean.
[1832.15s -> 1834.15s]  The top bar is not even a bar.
[1834.15s -> 1836.15s]  It's a series of flags.
[1836.15s -> 1839.16s]  It's a series of
[1839.16s -> 1841.16s]  symbols that point to the left.
[1841.16s -> 1843.16s]  I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[1843.16s -> 1845.16s]  The middle one is down arrow
[1845.16s -> 1849.70s]  with bar. And then the last one
[1849.70s -> 1851.70s]  I don't know. That's somebody making a
[1851.70s -> 1853.70s]  shadow on the wall with their hands.
[1853.70s -> 1855.70s]  With a light in front of it. Like a hand
[1855.70s -> 1857.70s]  puppet. I don't know what that means.
[1857.70s -> 1866.47s]  But good job.
[1866.47s -> 1872.62s]  You got almost 10 points.
[1872.62s -> 1874.62s]  If only there was a word for a symbol that
[1874.62s -> 1877.30s]  points in a direction.
[1877.30s -> 1879.30s]  Left. But why is that
[1879.30s -> 1881.30s]  what does left have to do with
[1881.30s -> 1887.64s]  this? Alright, let's fight.
[1887.64s -> 1891.16s]  No, not me and you, but like let's
[1891.16s -> 1893.16s]  let's see. How good are you doing now?
[1893.16s -> 1895.16s]  200 points? That's actually pretty good.
[1895.16s -> 1899.11s]  Okay, there it is.
[1899.11s -> 1901.11s]  Alright guys, if I didn't go to this menu
[1901.11s -> 1903.11s]  you can't tell me that you would think.
[1903.11s -> 1905.11s]  Focus, tired, and
[1905.11s -> 1909.59s]  fullness. That's focus
[1909.59s -> 1914.33s]  not left. Alright.
[1914.33s -> 1920.84s]  Let's just keep going.
[1920.84s -> 1924.55s]  Proceed to the weekend activities.
[1924.55s -> 1926.55s]  We can't do anything in town so let's just go.
[1926.55s -> 1932.63s]  Third week. When are we going to get a
[1932.63s -> 1934.94s]  tournament? Keeping up the good
[1934.94s -> 1936.94s]  work, Fane. I brought
[1936.94s -> 1938.94s]  some treats today. Here, give these snacks
[1938.94s -> 1941.75s]  to the monsters.
[1941.75s -> 1944.76s]  Plural, I don't have more than one.
[1944.76s -> 1946.76s]  On a ranch, you've got to train your monsters
[1946.76s -> 1948.76s]  but you've got to look after their health too.
[1948.76s -> 1951.45s]  Focus, fatigue, fullness,
[1951.45s -> 1953.45s]  status. You can check all these stats.
[1953.45s -> 1956.07s]  On the lower right gauge
[1956.07s -> 1958.31s]  during scheduling. During
[1958.31s -> 1960.31s]  free time, talk to your monsters plenty
[1960.31s -> 1962.31s]  and care for them as appropriate to their status.
[1962.31s -> 1964.55s]  And you know, breeder
[1964.55s -> 1966.55s]  rank and ranch status affect the number of
[1966.55s -> 1968.55s]  actions you can execute during free time.
[1968.55s -> 1970.98s]  You notice the small sphere
[1970.98s -> 1972.98s]  on the lower left during free time. That's the
[1972.98s -> 1974.98s]  number of actions you can do. Okay, good to know.
[1974.98s -> 1977.80s]  Now, there's one sphere
[1977.80s -> 1979.80s]  so I can do one
[1979.80s -> 1983.32s]  thing. Now, don't you forget
[1983.32s -> 1985.32s]  to feed your monsters. Well, do your best,
[1985.32s -> 1988.90s]  Fane. You received
[1988.90s -> 1991.14s]  two potatoes. Thanks
[1991.14s -> 1993.51s]  for the help. And two mangoes.
[1993.51s -> 1996.65s]  And a squid.
[1996.65s -> 2005.72s]  And a beef.
[2005.72s -> 2014.23s]  This week's HelloFresh came in.
[2014.23s -> 2017.82s]  Boy, man. Okay, so
[2017.82s -> 2019.82s]  it's raining. What do you got? Focus.
[2019.82s -> 2021.99s]  You're pretty focused. Tired.
[2021.99s -> 2025.70s]  Sorry.
[2025.70s -> 2030.50s]  This one was balance, right?
[2030.50s -> 2032.50s]  No, this is rest. Okay, this is rest.
[2032.50s -> 2037.24s]  Now, can I feed you from here?
[2037.24s -> 2045.11s]  Probably. Okay.
[2045.11s -> 2047.48s]  Food. What do you like?
[2047.48s -> 2051.51s]  Squid? I wonder what kind of
[2051.51s -> 2053.51s]  food you like.
[2053.51s -> 2056.33s]  Mango? Squid?
[2056.33s -> 2058.33s]  Most monsters eat it raw.
[2058.33s -> 2060.63s]  A big hunk of beef still on
[2060.63s -> 2062.63s]  the bone. It satisfies your monsters wild
[2062.63s -> 2071.96s]  side. Squid.
[2071.96s -> 2076.82s]  Disgusting. Pretty nice
[2076.82s -> 2078.82s]  triple Mario jump.
[2078.82s -> 2082.09s]  Yes, I'll make a Mario reference. I don't care.
[2082.09s -> 2086.81s]  Now he's dead.
[2086.81s -> 2088.81s]  Oh, don't ever eat undercooked squid.
[2088.81s -> 2092.26s]  Or you die.
[2092.26s -> 2096.36s]  Alright, let's go to the weekend.
[2096.36s -> 2098.36s]  How do I? I want another monster.
[2098.36s -> 2101.62s]  When am I going to get
[2101.62s -> 2103.62s]  to my stone?
[2103.62s -> 2106.38s]  I've got all kinds of weird shit to put in
[2106.38s -> 2108.38s]  here. I have a game that
[2108.38s -> 2110.38s]  I didn't get to play, that I was so
[2110.38s -> 2112.38s]  looking forward to, and I'm going to use it for today's.
[2112.38s -> 2114.74s]  Right? I bought a game
[2114.74s -> 2116.74s]  that I thought was going to be hilariously fun
[2116.74s -> 2119.30s]  for PC, and it just doesn't work.
[2119.30s -> 2121.61s]  Yawn. Up and at him.
[2121.61s -> 2124.68s]  Yeah. Hmm. A visitor.
[2124.68s -> 2128.84s]  Hee hee. Is that right?
[2128.84s -> 2131.72s]  I'm so glad you met such a
[2131.72s -> 2133.72s]  fun person, mouse.
[2133.72s -> 2136.79s]  Hey, Rio!
[2136.79s -> 2138.79s]  Oh, there you are. Whatcha up to?
[2138.79s -> 2141.35s]  Uh, oh, I
[2141.35s -> 2144.94s]  just dropped by.
[2144.94s -> 2148.52s]  Hey, she's gone!
[2148.52s -> 2150.52s]  Hey, Yuri! Do you think I said something wrong?
[2150.52s -> 2153.66s]  Don't worry, she's always like that.
[2153.66s -> 2156.15s]  She talks so kindly to monsters,
[2156.15s -> 2158.15s]  but doesn't say a word to the villagers.
[2158.15s -> 2161.93s]  She is a monster. Hmm, really?
[2161.93s -> 2168.58s]  Okay, what's the schedule look like
[2168.58s -> 2170.58s]  this week?
[2170.58s -> 2172.58s]  Balance, rest, exercise,
[2172.58s -> 2174.58s]  exercise, rest, exercise, exercise,
[2174.58s -> 2177.46s]  rest. Yeah.
[2177.46s -> 2179.46s]  That sounds pretty good. No, actually, don't fuck that.
[2179.46s -> 2190.73s]  I like that better.
[2190.73s -> 2192.73s]  Actually, hold on
[2192.73s -> 2194.73s]  a minute here. Hold on a minute.
[2194.73s -> 2197.42s]  I think I'd rather
[2197.42s -> 2199.42s]  put it on, like, you know, my streaming schedule.
[2199.42s -> 2201.42s]  You know what I mean?
[2201.42s -> 2215.29s]  Yeah, okay.
[2215.29s -> 2219.13s]  That looks good. Three days on,
[2219.13s -> 2221.13s]  two days off, two days on,
[2221.13s -> 2227.78s]  one day off. Go for it.
[2227.78s -> 2229.78s]  Let's get some more life.
[2229.78s -> 2237.14s]  Plus seven life, good.
[2237.14s -> 2240.28s]  Success rate at 90%.
[2240.28s -> 2244.18s]  I wonder, you know what I kinda miss?
[2244.18s -> 2246.18s]  I really do miss from the second game, when you get to see
[2246.18s -> 2248.18s]  like the fun little cartoon of them doing it or failing
[2248.18s -> 2250.18s]  it or not, you know what I mean?
[2250.18s -> 2254.22s]  This is dumb. Where's like the cool
[2254.22s -> 2256.22s]  where's like the them actually doing the technique
[2256.22s -> 2258.22s]  and try, you know what I mean?
[2258.22s -> 2260.90s]  You're just balancing on one foot and I see a meter
[2260.90s -> 2265.64s]  go up. Uh, how you doing?
[2265.64s -> 2273.70s]  Lively. The first,
[2273.70s -> 2276.20s]  Monster Hunter 2 really is the best game.
[2276.20s -> 2278.20s]  It's like really the only one you should play.
[2278.20s -> 2280.20s]  But, hold on, I'm gonna hold off
[2280.20s -> 2282.20s]  until we get some more monsters here.
[2282.20s -> 2287.19s]  Alright, he's not hungry, he's fine.
[2287.19s -> 2294.62s]  Just play two? Well, I need to see
[2294.62s -> 2296.62s]  what this has to offer.
[2296.62s -> 2299.18s]  I'm not gonna write it off yet.
[2299.18s -> 2301.18s]  The moon is so bright tonight, I can't sleep.
[2301.18s -> 2303.18s]  God, I wish I had that super power
[2303.18s -> 2305.18s]  that Gerber985 talked about at the beginning of the stream.
[2305.18s -> 2307.80s]  When I was
[2307.80s -> 2309.80s]  expelled from school, I thought I lost my shot
[2309.80s -> 2312.49s]  at my dreams. But now
[2312.49s -> 2314.49s]  here I am, standing in the middle of this ranch.
[2314.49s -> 2316.66s]  Under such a beautiful moon,
[2316.66s -> 2319.35s]  what a strange fate.
[2319.35s -> 2321.35s]  Is somebody there?
[2321.35s -> 2325.70s]  We don't get many chances to meet these days,
[2325.70s -> 2328.97s]  do we? Well, you know,
[2328.97s -> 2330.97s]  you're welcome to come any time
[2330.97s -> 2334.49s]  you like. He sure
[2334.49s -> 2336.49s]  seems like a nice boy.
[2336.49s -> 2338.98s]  I sure wish I could meet him too.
[2338.98s -> 2342.23s]  No.
[2342.23s -> 2344.23s]  If you did that, you'd be in trouble.
[2344.23s -> 2347.05s]  Just like I am now.
[2347.05s -> 2349.29s]  I'm sorry, please
[2349.29s -> 2351.29s]  don't cry, Rio.
[2351.29s -> 2353.29s]  Is this a tree? Don't worry, I won't
[2353.29s -> 2355.29s]  do anything rash, okay, Rio?
[2355.29s -> 2359.30s]  Rio?
[2359.30s -> 2361.67s]  No, I'm sorry. Well, I've gotta go.
[2361.67s -> 2363.67s]  Rio, who is she talking to?
[2363.67s -> 2366.23s]  I couldn't get a good look.
[2366.23s -> 2382.66s]  There's a tree.
[2382.66s -> 2385.99s]  It was sweet rind.
[2385.99s -> 2388.23s]  Hey, week one, mate.
[2388.23s -> 2390.23s]  We have a visitor. Okay, let's get this- ow.
[2390.23s -> 2393.75s]  Let's get the game going.
[2393.75s -> 2395.75s]  Hello, Yuri, and Fane.
[2395.75s -> 2398.50s]  This place is turning into a very
[2398.50s -> 2401.26s]  nice ranch. You bet it is.
[2401.26s -> 2403.26s]  I wouldn't settle for anything less.
[2403.26s -> 2406.38s]  So what brings you here?
[2406.38s -> 2408.38s]  Well, I figured it's about time for you to
[2408.38s -> 2410.38s]  start thinking about the competition.
[2410.38s -> 2413.00s]  Would you like to go and take a look
[2413.00s -> 2415.62s]  first? Wow, yeah, of course.
[2415.62s -> 2418.38s]  I'd love to go. You too, right?
[2418.38s -> 2421.11s]  Fane, I'm not doing that every time.
[2421.11s -> 2423.74s]  Yeah, sure, I'll bring Miles along.
[2423.74s -> 2425.74s]  Are we gonna get a heart tear
[2425.74s -> 2428.62s]  at the heartstrings here?
[2428.62s -> 2430.62s]  Are we gonna lose this monster?
[2430.62s -> 2433.56s]  This sure is exciting.
[2433.56s -> 2435.56s]  Next is the main event with the Ruin
[2435.56s -> 2441.75s]  and Breeders.
[2441.75s -> 2443.75s]  The rabbit class.
[2443.75s -> 2447.66s]  Ladies and gentlemen, finally presenting
[2447.66s -> 2449.66s]  the beautiful thorned rose of Thimba.
[2449.66s -> 2452.22s]  Miss Titi
[2452.22s -> 2455.16s]  and her Kalarino.
[2455.16s -> 2458.74s]  Why is she here?
[2458.74s -> 2460.98s]  If it isn't that kiddo, what the heck are you
[2460.98s -> 2463.29s]  doing here?
[2463.29s -> 2465.29s]  You even brought a monster? Wait a minute, don't tell me
[2465.29s -> 2467.98s]  you are a Breeder.
[2467.98s -> 2470.15s]  Well, well. Is that so?
[2470.15s -> 2472.95s]  Hmm.
[2472.95s -> 2474.95s]  Well, I can see you've got the perfect monster
[2474.95s -> 2476.95s]  for playing in a sandbox.
[2476.95s -> 2478.95s]  The whole crowd fucking
[2478.95s -> 2481.38s]  laughs. What did you say?
[2481.38s -> 2484.26s]  See, I just did that.
[2484.26s -> 2486.89s]  I just fucking did that laugh.
[2486.89s -> 2489.38s]  I think syllable for syllable.
[2489.38s -> 2493.61s]  I told you guys think I'm
[2493.61s -> 2495.61s]  fucking stupid. I know these things.
[2495.61s -> 2498.30s]  At least you'll get to see my wonderful fighting
[2498.30s -> 2500.79s]  style. Hmm. Well, I could give you
[2500.79s -> 2502.79s]  my signature. At least that would make your
[2502.79s -> 2506.12s]  trip here worthwhile.
[2506.12s -> 2508.81s]  And then I laughed. And then we fight
[2508.81s -> 2512.90s]  and we instantly beat this person.
[2512.90s -> 2514.90s]  Because this person actually sucks at what they do.
[2514.90s -> 2522.52s]  What? Oh, we're not playing.
[2522.52s -> 2529.16s]  Apparently we're not playing. My internet's
[2529.16s -> 2533.32s]  dying though. Are we good?
[2533.32s -> 2536.25s]  Come on, man. Come on.
[2536.25s -> 2540.92s]  I'm dropping a lot of frames.
[2540.92s -> 2543.61s]  Are you guys seeing the frames?
[2543.61s -> 2545.61s]  It looks like I'm dropping a shitload of frames.
[2545.61s -> 2549.56s]  I think we're okay.
[2549.56s -> 2554.23s]  RIP INT
[2554.23s -> 2556.23s]  for internet, probably.
[2556.23s -> 2562.76s]  Hmm. Well,
[2562.76s -> 2564.76s]  we'll just let it see if it passes. Usually it does.
[2564.76s -> 2568.73s]  I hope so.
[2568.73s -> 2570.73s]  Oh, what is wrong with that girl? I'm getting really impatient
[2570.73s -> 2572.73s]  with her. I'm getting impatient with cocks too.
[2572.73s -> 2577.77s]  Huh? It's real.
[2577.77s -> 2580.84s]  It looks like, is that like an emoji?
[2580.84s -> 2583.27s]  That looks like somebody doing an
[2583.27s -> 2588.78s]  elaborate emoji in chat.
[2588.78s -> 2592.55s]  That has to be something. I don't know
[2592.55s -> 2594.55s]  what that would mean, but
[2594.55s -> 2597.56s]  it might mean something.
[2634.98s -> 2637.28s]  Association.
[2637.28s -> 2639.28s]  Monster Association, yes.
[2639.28s -> 2641.78s]  Finally. Got a 45 minute
[2641.78s -> 2647.22s]  tutorial here.
[2649.90s -> 2652.72s]  Here we are.
[2652.72s -> 2654.72s]  Alright. So.
[2654.72s -> 2656.72s]  Combine, retire,
[2656.72s -> 2659.02s]  ranch. I don't, do I
[2659.02s -> 2663.18s]  really want to retire mouths?
[2663.18s -> 2669.14s]  Do I? Thank you very much.
[2669.14s -> 2671.95s]  No, shit.
[2671.95s -> 2673.95s]  Couldn't you freeze them? You can't freeze them in this game?
[2673.95s -> 2688.93s]  Once you retire, you
[2688.93s -> 2690.93s]  cannot unfreeze. You can only
[2690.93s -> 2693.30s]  combine. Oh, shit.
[2693.30s -> 2697.01s]  Oh, that's not good.
[2697.01s -> 2703.98s]  But, we need to put like
[2703.98s -> 2705.98s]  C-man in here. No.
[2705.98s -> 2712.64s]  See you later. I need to see
[2712.64s -> 2714.64s]  what comes out of C-man. It's important.
[2714.64s -> 2720.53s]  But don't, we can combine
[2720.53s -> 2725.65s]  retire
[2725.65s -> 2727.89s]  mouths.
[2727.89s -> 2729.89s]  This is going to end up being a mistake.
[2729.89s -> 2732.70s]  But, 200 power.
[2732.70s -> 2735.26s]  We'll get something better. You had
[2735.26s -> 2737.26s]  a good run of doing
[2737.26s -> 2739.26s]  30 fucking
[2739.26s -> 2741.26s]  push-ups. And like balancing
[2741.26s -> 2752.40s]  on your foot for 5 minutes.
[2752.40s -> 2754.40s]  Bye. This is like fucking
[2754.40s -> 2763.87s]  kind of...
[2763.87s -> 2765.87s]  That was really sad.
[2765.87s -> 2767.87s]  What'll it be?
[2767.87s -> 2769.87s]  Which method will you use to create
[2769.87s -> 2771.87s]  a monster? From the
[2771.87s -> 2774.18s]  saucer. Alright,
[2774.18s -> 2776.48s]  you ready?
[2776.48s -> 2778.85s]  Well, let's turn the camera on.
[2778.85s -> 2782.56s]  I did like a disappearing
[2782.56s -> 2784.56s]  act right there. Alright, first thing going
[2784.56s -> 2787.18s]  in. By the way, hi.
[2787.18s -> 2796.34s]  First thing going in, as you know,
[2796.34s -> 2801.89s]  is going to be C-man. C-man is the first
[2801.89s -> 2806.37s]  game going in. See you in a minute.
[2806.37s -> 2813.60s]  Your hair looks great.
[2813.60s -> 2817.06s]  Jimmy Newton Mustache.
[2817.06s -> 2819.06s]  Single left side mustache hair.
[2819.06s -> 2822.32s]  Alright, open the disc tray.
[2822.32s -> 2824.50s]  Opening disc tray, okay.
[2824.50s -> 2828.91s]  What are you talking about? Insert a CD
[2828.91s -> 2830.91s]  or DVD into the disc tray and push the X
[2830.91s -> 2833.73s]  button. Here we go.
[2833.73s -> 2838.14s]  We are going to see what we get from C-man.
[2838.14s -> 2840.14s]  And we'll try a few of these.
[2840.14s -> 2848.45s]  And then press X. Checking
[2848.45s -> 2855.62s]  disc. I'm going to laugh.
[2855.62s -> 2857.62s]  If it's a fish with a face, then we have to play with it.
[2857.62s -> 2862.42s]  Any CD will work.
[2862.42s -> 2864.42s]  No matter what it is, as long as it has data on the disc.
[2864.42s -> 2870.61s]  Alright, here we go.
[2870.61s -> 2872.61s]  Opening disc tray, if okay, press the X
[2872.61s -> 2874.61s]  button. I don't know what they keep saying that for.
[2874.61s -> 2881.12s]  Alright.
[2881.12s -> 2888.42s]  Hold your breath. What
[2888.42s -> 2890.42s]  classic monster are we going to get out of
[2890.42s -> 2897.07s]  here? Remember when you recorded
[2897.07s -> 2899.07s]  yourself screaming and it caused a blackout?
[2899.07s -> 2903.36s]  I do. Okay.
[2903.36s -> 2905.36s]  Thanks for waiting. Time to create a monster.
[2905.36s -> 2910.48s]  Pull the lever.
[2910.48s -> 2914.96s]  The planets have to align.
[2914.96s -> 2927.25s]  What the hell is that?
[2927.25s -> 2931.47s]  An odd monster, I'd say.
[2931.47s -> 2934.03s]  I see it's the first time
[2934.03s -> 2936.03s]  Fane has raised this monster. Let me
[2936.03s -> 2938.59s]  add a page to your book.
[2938.59s -> 2940.59s]  Take this monster home with you.
[2940.59s -> 2942.59s]  Um, yes.
[2942.59s -> 2947.52s]  So you're naming this monster?
[2947.52s -> 2950.96s]  Uh, it's like a
[2950.96s -> 2952.96s]  hippopotamus
[2952.96s -> 2954.96s]  rhinoceros triceratops on a wheel.
[2954.96s -> 2958.91s]  Yeah.
[2958.91s -> 2962.67s]  It was
[2962.67s -> 2964.67s]  Fane. It has to be Vroomer.
[2964.67s -> 2969.28s]  Is Vroomer okay?
[2971.28s -> 2979.98s]  Uh, can you praise
[2979.98s -> 2984.90s]  my monster? Oh.
[2984.90s -> 2986.90s]  Let's go back to the ranch and take a look at the stats.
[2986.90s -> 2995.47s]  Does what CD, what you put in
[2995.47s -> 2997.97s]  matter? Um,
[2997.97s -> 2999.97s]  I think you'll get the same thing from the same
[2999.97s -> 3001.97s]  disc. It's just a seed
[3001.97s -> 3004.40s]  that is created from whatever
[3004.40s -> 3006.83s]  is on the disc.
[3006.83s -> 3008.83s]  So, it's just, it could be
[3008.83s -> 3010.83s]  it is random, but whatever the seed
[3010.83s -> 3012.83s]  that comes from the data on the disc
[3012.83s -> 3015.07s]  I believe is the same seed.
[3015.07s -> 3017.07s]  Maybe. This could be wrong.
[3017.07s -> 3019.07s]  Alright, let's go. Uh, let's take a look.
[3019.07s -> 3024.51s]  Oh, you are
[3024.51s -> 3027.90s]  terrible. Look at how bad
[3027.90s -> 3029.90s]  this monster is.
[3029.90s -> 3031.90s]  133 is the highest stat.
[3031.90s -> 3034.14s]  What do you have from moves?
[3034.14s -> 3038.75s]  You've got backspin
[3038.75s -> 3040.75s]  and drifting.
[3040.75s -> 3045.60s]  Drifting.
[3045.60s -> 3047.84s]  Drifting does a
[3047.84s -> 3049.84s]  decent damage, but with a high crit.
[3049.84s -> 3051.84s]  It takes 23
[3051.84s -> 3054.21s]  guts to use.
[3054.21s -> 3056.21s]  It has no effect. This has no effect
[3056.21s -> 3060.54s]  either. Well,
[3060.54s -> 3062.54s]  so it's obviously a power-based
[3062.54s -> 3067.02s]  monster. Goddammit.
[3067.02s -> 3071.06s]  This thing sucks.
[3071.06s -> 3073.23s]  Looks like power and
[3073.23s -> 3076.82s]  accuracy. I don't know what you're gonna have to do.
[3076.82s -> 3078.99s]  Alright, let's do some training
[3078.99s -> 3080.99s]  here. Let's see if we can get this any better.
[3080.99s -> 3086.18s]  Schedule. We got no
[3086.18s -> 3088.18s]  rest. Power.
[3088.18s -> 3090.18s]  The next week. Power again.
[3090.18s -> 3092.54s]  You can rest and then
[3092.54s -> 3094.91s]  let's go with
[3094.91s -> 3097.34s]  shadow boxing.
[3097.34s -> 3099.34s]  Shadow boxing.
[3099.34s -> 3102.61s]  Rest. Power.
[3102.61s -> 3104.61s]  Rest. No.
[3104.61s -> 3106.98s]  Power.
[3106.98s -> 3109.22s]  Alright, let's go for it. Let's see if I can get
[3109.22s -> 3115.49s]  anything better.
[3115.49s -> 3121.44s]  It just picks up its wheel.
[3121.44s -> 3123.44s]  That's all it does. It just lifts up
[3123.44s -> 3127.86s]  its wheel over and over again.
[3127.86s -> 3129.86s]  I didn't see it fit. Okay, that's
[3129.86s -> 3131.86s]  why notifications don't go
[3131.86s -> 3133.86s]  through audio-wise because I'm plugged into
[3133.86s -> 3135.86s]  the PlayStation 2.
[3135.86s -> 3137.86s]  But Comedy Chatman gave 50
[3137.86s -> 3140.54s]  bucks. Thank you so much Comedy
[3140.54s -> 3142.54s]  Chatman. Five
[3142.54s -> 3146.64s]  thousand bits. I will not financially
[3146.64s -> 3148.64s]  support a man who plays Monster Hunter.
[3148.64s -> 3150.64s]  It's not about the money this time. It's about
[3150.64s -> 3152.64s]  the message. Well, this is Monster
[3152.64s -> 3154.64s]  Rancher, so I'm not playing Monster
[3154.64s -> 3156.64s]  Hunter, so that's fine.
[3156.64s -> 3158.64s]  He's doing CrossFit.
[3158.64s -> 3163.55s]  This is such a weird,
[3163.55s -> 3165.55s]  uncanny, strange person here.
[3165.55s -> 3169.07s]  But thank you so much Comedy Chatman
[3169.07s -> 3171.07s]  for the 50 fucking dollars.
[3171.07s -> 3173.31s]  How much does that
[3173.31s -> 3175.31s]  raise it by? Not by very much, but
[3175.31s -> 3177.81s]  I feel like we can take this thing
[3177.81s -> 3192.64s]  somewhere.
[3192.64s -> 3194.64s]  Somebody said, is the wheel part of
[3194.64s -> 3196.64s]  his flesh? It has to be.
[3196.64s -> 3200.29s]  Watching Who five community subs. Thank
[3200.29s -> 3206.37s]  you, Watching Who. So much better than
[3206.37s -> 3208.37s]  Mao's. Well, statistically, no.
[3208.37s -> 3210.67s]  But aesthetically, yes.
[3210.67s -> 3215.15s]  Yeah, this is part of his
[3215.15s -> 3217.15s]  body. This weird wheel is part of his
[3217.15s -> 3219.52s]  body. It's somehow detached.
[3219.52s -> 3222.34s]  Creepily enough. Alright, let's go.
[3222.34s -> 3225.09s]  You don't need to eat right now.
[3225.09s -> 3235.52s]  The moonlight is bright tonight, just like
[3235.52s -> 3240.13s]  the other night. Where is Vroomer
[3240.13s -> 3246.27s]  heading off to? Okay, for a second I thought
[3246.27s -> 3248.27s]  that was the car noise going by.
[3248.27s -> 3250.27s]  I was about to be like, you gotta be kidding me.
[3250.27s -> 3252.77s]  Well, Rio, I can see the monsters love
[3252.77s -> 3254.77s]  you, like they always do.
[3254.77s -> 3258.10s]  I have an idea. Why don't you run the ranch
[3258.10s -> 3260.85s]  along with that boy, Fane?
[3260.85s -> 3262.85s]  I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun. Don't you
[3262.85s -> 3266.18s]  believe Vroomer? I can't.
[3266.18s -> 3268.18s]  It'll just turn out the same as always.
[3268.18s -> 3270.18s]  They'll become scared of me and
[3270.18s -> 3274.53s]  eventually hate me. I don't want
[3274.53s -> 3276.53s]  to be hated again.
[3276.53s -> 3279.02s]  You mustn't assume things, Rio.
[3279.02s -> 3281.02s]  You've got to open your eyes. Be brave
[3281.02s -> 3283.02s]  and say what you want to say.
[3283.02s -> 3287.95s]  When you have too many sequels, you just start to make
[3287.95s -> 3289.95s]  like a dumb fucked up story when it's just
[3289.95s -> 3291.95s]  about like raising monsters and like battling them
[3291.95s -> 3293.95s]  Pokemon style. Why are we doing like talking to like a magic
[3293.95s -> 3298.56s]  tree in this game? Ai!
[3298.56s -> 3302.83s]  What? What, Fane?
[3302.83s -> 3305.65s]  No, don't look at me!
[3305.65s -> 3307.65s]  No, it's alright, Rio. You can't hide
[3307.65s -> 3309.95s]  it forever. I told you she was a monster.
[3309.95s -> 3311.95s]  It's a beautiful moon tonight anyway.
[3311.95s -> 3314.26s]  Why not talk it all out?
[3314.26s -> 3318.54s]  My name is
[3318.54s -> 3321.73s]  Mukruji. Trees
[3321.73s -> 3323.73s]  with unusual powers like myself
[3323.73s -> 3325.73s]  are called Spirit Trees.
[3325.73s -> 3327.73s]  Who's talking? Oh, he is.
[3327.73s -> 3330.29s]  I'm one of the- I was gonna say, you're not a tree.
[3330.29s -> 3332.29s]  Like, pretending to be a tree.
[3332.29s -> 3335.62s]  I'm one of the oldest
[3335.62s -> 3338.56s]  Spirit Trees. And at some point
[3338.56s -> 3340.56s]  in my life, I learned to speak human
[3340.56s -> 3344.72s]  a bit. At some point, I learned how to speak
[3344.72s -> 3349.25s]  human. Every language.
[3349.25s -> 3354.88s]  I didn't want to surprise them, so during
[3354.88s -> 3358.91s]  the day, I stay quiet. Wow, but
[3358.91s -> 3360.91s]  you know, isn't it kind of sad to
[3360.91s -> 3366.29s]  stay quiet even though you can speak?
[3366.29s -> 3369.55s]  What do you- You humans
[3369.55s -> 3371.55s]  have nothing but fear of any kind of power.
[3371.55s -> 3373.86s]  You don't understand. You attack it!
[3373.86s -> 3377.62s]  Rio, what are you doing? I'm
[3377.62s -> 3379.62s]  sorry about her. Rio, you see, is a very
[3379.62s -> 3381.62s]  unusual girl. She's a part
[3381.62s -> 3383.98s]  tree. She has the power to talk to
[3383.98s -> 3387.57s]  monsters. And from a young age,
[3387.57s -> 3389.57s]  that power was feared by others
[3389.57s -> 3393.22s]  and she was disliked for it.
[3393.22s -> 3396.42s]  I didn't know that. I'm sorry, Rio, but
[3396.42s -> 3399.36s]  you shouldn't keep your thoughts to yourself.
[3399.36s -> 3401.36s]  If you do, you'll never be able to share your feelings.
[3401.36s -> 3404.30s]  Rio, you just have more chances
[3404.30s -> 3406.30s]  to understand others than ordinary people do.
[3406.30s -> 3408.99s]  This is what happens when writers and developers get bored.
[3408.99s -> 3411.23s]  It just is. This is Monster Rancher 4.
[3411.23s -> 3416.14s]  You know what I mean? At some point,
[3416.14s -> 3419.09s]  you just, like, you don't want to make
[3419.09s -> 3422.03s]  Monster Rancher 2 again.
[3422.03s -> 3424.78s]  So now you're making-
[3424.78s -> 3431.82s]  It's like you got bored and you're gonna make something else.
[3431.82s -> 3434.13s]  Yeah, chances. To be able to speak
[3434.13s -> 3436.13s]  and understand monster language, that's an amazing
[3436.13s -> 3441.18s]  opportunity. I've never thought about
[3441.18s -> 3445.22s]  it that way. I was always just so scared.
[3445.22s -> 3447.22s]  I couldn't look at it that way. Does this happen in
[3447.22s -> 3449.22s]  the anime? Or is the anime like a different
[3449.22s -> 3454.08s]  universe? If you close your heart, you'll never
[3454.08s -> 3456.08s]  be able to rid yourself of your fears.
[3456.08s -> 3459.46s]  You might be right,
[3459.46s -> 3462.27s]  Sora. Oh, it's about time for me to go
[3462.27s -> 3468.27s]  home. Good night, Fane.
[3468.27s -> 3475.42s]  Yeah, good night, Rio. Okay.
[3475.42s -> 3477.42s]  Do nothing and proceed to the next week. Let's go.
[3477.42s -> 3485.04s]  May, week two. Spring.
[3485.04s -> 3489.50s]  Another day ahead of us, Vroomer.
[3489.50s -> 3491.94s]  Wait, Fane, first, take this. What is it?
[3491.94s -> 3494.62s]  It's my extra special battle practice,
[3494.62s -> 3499.04s]  Kitty Meowser. First, use this
[3499.04s -> 3501.04s]  to review monster battles, okay?
[3501.04s -> 3503.86s]  What's with you today, Yuri? Pretty early
[3503.86s -> 3505.86s]  to be bouncing off the walls.
[3505.86s -> 3509.18s]  You wanna know why? Cause I'm determined
[3509.18s -> 3511.18s]  to beat that nasty girl in the competition.
[3511.18s -> 3513.42s]  I'll kick her butt to Kingdom
[3513.42s -> 3515.42s]  Come. I'll send her to a one-way trip to
[3515.42s -> 3518.18s]  La La Land. Vroomer!
[3518.18s -> 3520.18s]  Imagine this is her and let her
[3520.18s -> 3523.25s]  have it. We're gonna get beat by the training
[3523.25s -> 3534.32s]  dummy. Vroomer versus Meowser.
[3534.32s -> 3538.42s]  Alright, do I get to see the
[3538.42s -> 3540.42s]  their stats? They usually have the screen.
[3540.42s -> 3545.41s]  I guess that is their stats. Ready.
[3545.41s -> 3547.90s]  Fight. Alright, here we go.
[3547.90s -> 3550.27s]  You ready, Fane? Here I go.
[3550.27s -> 3552.27s]  First, approach the opponent. Get into short
[3552.27s -> 3555.22s]  range.
[3555.22s -> 3557.22s]  Hey, don't back up. Get close. I'm trying.
[3557.22s -> 3561.70s]  You moving the camera around. There you go.
[3561.70s -> 3563.70s]  That's within short range.
[3563.70s -> 3566.26s]  Next is step back.
[3566.26s -> 3568.26s]  Press the D-pad or left stick away from the opponent
[3568.26s -> 3571.84s]  then push the triangle button.
[3571.84s -> 3574.53s]  Yep, that's just like the second one.
[3574.53s -> 3577.73s]  Yes, perfect. This is called a
[3577.73s -> 3579.90s]  step back. Don't forget.
[3579.90s -> 3582.14s]  Next is a step in. Push the D-pad
[3582.14s -> 3584.14s]  or left stick toward the opponent then push triangle.
[3584.14s -> 3587.73s]  Yep, you need like a little dash to get close.
[3587.73s -> 3589.73s]  Exactamundo.
[3589.73s -> 3591.73s]  All tens. This is called a step in.
[3591.73s -> 3593.90s]  Next is a slam. Get close to
[3593.90s -> 3595.90s]  your opponent and push. Yeah, you can break
[3595.90s -> 3599.62s]  it up, right? Nice
[3599.62s -> 3602.18s]  throw. Next, use panel rotation
[3602.18s -> 3604.18s]  to select a move. R1 and R2
[3604.18s -> 3606.18s]  buttons swivel it around.
[3606.18s -> 3610.14s]  R1, okay. You get multiple panels.
[3610.14s -> 3617.06s]  Panel rotation.
[3617.06s -> 3621.92s]  Try your skills. Give them hell. Move to the distance
[3621.92s -> 3623.92s]  set in the skill panel. Yep.
[3623.92s -> 3625.92s]  And push the O, X, or you can push any button.
[3625.92s -> 3629.25s]  Okay, so
[3629.25s -> 3632.94s]  drift. Guts
[3632.94s -> 3636.72s]  down. Very good. Now you're ready to
[3636.72s -> 3640.30s]  compete in the tournaments.
[3640.30s -> 3642.86s]  It's just like the second game.
[3642.86s -> 3644.86s]  The combat is very much
[3644.86s -> 3649.02s]  the second game. I don't know how it was in the
[3649.02s -> 3651.02s]  third game. I don't think we even saw combat in the third game.
[3651.02s -> 3656.02s]  I didn't like the third game at all.
[3656.02s -> 3658.32s]  Okay, so use the skills screen
[3658.32s -> 3660.32s]  under monster data to assign monster skills to the
[3660.32s -> 3666.27s]  panel, right?
[3666.27s -> 3668.27s]  After you learn a new skill, don't forget to assign it
[3668.27s -> 3670.27s]  to a panel. You can't use the
[3670.27s -> 3673.41s]  skill without it being assigned.
[3673.41s -> 3675.41s]  Also, if you learn knowledge of fire, et cetera,
[3675.41s -> 3677.41s]  you can assign elements to certain skills.
[3677.41s -> 3680.22s]  That's a whole nother layer.
[3680.22s -> 3682.40s]  Try to figure out the weak points of your
[3682.40s -> 3684.40s]  enemies. You got it? Yes.
[3684.40s -> 3686.70s]  Practice makes perfect. Do your best.
[3686.70s -> 3691.63s]  Alright.
[3691.63s -> 3693.81s]  So.
[3693.81s -> 3696.56s]  Let's go to the schedule here.
[3696.56s -> 3700.08s]  Yeah. We're gonna do power here.
[3700.08s -> 3703.34s]  Go for it.
[3703.34s -> 3706.93s]  No, no, no, no, no. This.
[3706.93s -> 3711.02s]  Are these games actually any good?
[3711.02s -> 3713.46s]  They are. There we go.
[3713.46s -> 3715.46s]  Plus nine. Level eight
[3715.46s -> 3717.46s]  power. New move, maybe?
[3717.46s -> 3723.98s]  How you doing? Eh, you're a little
[3723.98s -> 3725.98s]  not that tired. You're fine.
[3725.98s -> 3731.02s]  Good work. He looks like a
[3731.02s -> 3733.02s]  beanie baby. He does
[3733.02s -> 3736.10s]  look like a beanie baby.
[3736.10s -> 3739.55s]  Nice job, rumor.
[3739.55s -> 3745.82s]  Let's keep going to the weekend.
[3745.82s -> 3755.42s]  Which one is my favorite? Monster
[3755.42s -> 3758.69s]  Arranger 2 is probably the best.
[3758.69s -> 3760.99s]  So far, at least. Let's try entering
[3760.99s -> 3762.99s]  a competition. Sounds like a good idea.
[3762.99s -> 3765.36s]  But I don't really know how. Maybe
[3765.36s -> 3767.36s]  we should go talk to Cynthia about it.
[3767.36s -> 3770.56s]  Hehe, I thought you'd say that. So I brought
[3770.56s -> 3772.56s]  a competition calendar. Use this
[3772.56s -> 3774.56s]  to enter the competition.
[3774.56s -> 3776.56s]  First, use the cursor to mark the competition that
[3776.56s -> 3778.56s]  you want to enter on the calendar. Right, you just
[3778.56s -> 3780.56s]  go. I get it.
[3780.56s -> 3782.56s]  Then select the monster and add it to the schedule.
[3782.56s -> 3786.53s]  Next, find a weekend
[3786.53s -> 3788.53s]  that a competition is being held and
[3788.53s -> 3790.53s]  selected as your weekend activity.
[3790.53s -> 3793.66s]  Also, to enter official competitions,
[3793.66s -> 3795.66s]  you have to first earn star points
[3795.66s -> 3797.66s]  from normal competitions.
[3797.66s -> 3799.66s]  If you win an official competition, your monster's
[3799.66s -> 3801.66s]  rank rises. And you can enter
[3801.66s -> 3804.48s]  higher ranked competition.
[3804.48s -> 3806.48s]  But to enter the top ranked official competition, your breeder
[3806.48s -> 3808.48s]  rank has to rise, too.
[3808.48s -> 3810.48s]  Only the association can
[3810.48s -> 3812.48s]  It's hard to know when your rank
[3812.48s -> 3814.48s]  will, yeah. So I guess you just
[3814.48s -> 3816.48s]  have to hope for the best.
[3816.48s -> 3818.85s]  I guess that's about it. Well, did you get all that?
[3818.85s -> 3821.28s]  Yeah. You're all set.
[3821.28s -> 3825.06s]  Let's beat that annoying
[3825.06s -> 3827.06s]  TT girl. Welcome to Monster Rancher 4
[3827.06s -> 3833.82s]  calendar.
[3833.82s -> 3836.90s]  So we have
[3836.90s -> 3839.33s]  800 bucks.
[3839.33s -> 3842.72s]  And we get a potato. What a
[3842.72s -> 3844.72s]  shitty competition. So we're currently
[3844.72s -> 3847.54s]  E ranked. You climb
[3847.54s -> 3849.54s]  all the way up to S. I think the highest we've ever
[3849.54s -> 3851.54s]  been in Monster Rancher 2 was
[3851.54s -> 3853.54s]  like A or B, right? That's the farthest
[3853.54s -> 3855.54s]  we got before I stopped playing.
[3855.54s -> 3859.50s]  Alright, so this is the single raspberry
[3859.50s -> 3861.50s]  cup. This is today, right?
[3867.07s -> 3872.30s]  Potato, tournament,
[3872.30s -> 3874.30s]  tournament prize. It's all the same thing.
[3874.30s -> 3877.06s]  So this is May. This is week
[3877.06s -> 3879.06s]  four. Let's
[3879.06s -> 3881.06s]  wait. Let's get this one.
[3881.06s -> 3883.06s]  Week two, June.
[3883.06s -> 3886.38s]  Let's enter this one.
[3886.38s -> 3895.46s]  All set, right?
[3895.46s -> 3897.46s]  Yeah. Rumor's in there, right?
[3897.46s -> 3903.73s]  So now let's look at the schedule.
[3903.73s -> 3905.73s]  So June,
[3905.73s -> 3907.73s]  here it is. Let's
[3907.73s -> 3910.03s]  actually rest up. See if we
[3910.03s -> 3913.68s]  can do anything here.
[3913.68s -> 3916.29s]  Let's train
[3916.29s -> 3919.23s]  today. And then
[3919.23s -> 3921.23s]  train tomorrow
[3921.23s -> 3923.23s]  here.
[3923.23s -> 3925.23s]  And then rest the day before.
[3928.03s -> 3934.37s]  So we got shadow box,
[3934.37s -> 3936.54s]  exercise, rest.
[3936.54s -> 3938.54s]  And then rest the day at the tournament too.
[3938.54s -> 3941.36s]  Sounds pretty sick to me.
[3941.36s -> 3947.62s]  Here we go.
[3947.62s -> 3949.62s]  Any points? Plus seven points inaccuracy.
[3949.62s -> 3965.36s]  Should we like play or something?
[3965.36s -> 3968.05s]  Alright, let's
[3968.05s -> 3970.05s]  give you some food. What do you eat for food?
[3970.05s -> 3972.05s]  Is this a carnivore?
[3972.05s -> 3974.61s]  I don't think so. Mango?
[3974.61s -> 3978.38s]  Here, try one of these.
[3978.38s -> 3984.40s]  I think he liked it. I think that means I like
[3984.40s -> 3990.03s]  it. He's doing okay.
[3990.03s -> 3995.09s]  Let's just go to the weekend.
[3995.09s -> 3998.80s]  Competition. Enter
[3998.80s -> 4000.80s]  monster being raised in competition. No.
[4000.80s -> 4010.83s]  Not ready yet.
[4010.83s -> 4012.83s]  So this is week four.
[4012.83s -> 4021.65s]  Lift.
[4021.65s -> 4026.13s]  Nice. Still have a really high success rate.
[4026.13s -> 4028.56s]  During free time you can
[4028.56s -> 4031.38s]  feed and praise, scold.
[4031.38s -> 4034.58s]  You can give items too.
[4034.58s -> 4039.44s]  Praise. It's bouncing with
[4039.44s -> 4041.44s]  agony. You need to euthanize this thing.
[4041.44s -> 4043.44s]  What? No.
[4043.44s -> 4045.81s]  What are you talking about?
[4045.81s -> 4050.80s]  It's having like a bunch of fun.
[4050.80s -> 4053.10s]  Alright, here we go. Weekend.
[4053.10s -> 4055.10s]  How's this? Let's take a look at the stats now.
[4055.10s -> 4057.28s]  Not bad.
[4057.28s -> 4059.28s]  156, 134.
[4059.28s -> 4061.28s]  It'll be probably around like 160.
[4061.28s -> 4067.68s]  What's it carrying?
[4067.68s -> 4069.68s]  It's carrying its own body, which is a wheel.
[4069.68s -> 4075.95s]  Somehow. Alright, this is the last week
[4075.95s -> 4079.66s]  before the tournament.
[4079.66s -> 4088.24s]  This is a day of rest.
[4088.24s -> 4090.24s]  Be gentle to this kind creature. I am.
[4090.24s -> 4094.13s]  I don't think there's
[4094.13s -> 4096.13s]  anything else I can do, so I might as well just
[4096.13s -> 4098.13s]  begin the training.
[4098.13s -> 4100.13s]  Isn't the training just rest?
[4100.13s -> 4102.13s]  It is, right?
[4102.13s -> 4105.14s]  Yeah.
[4105.14s -> 4118.77s]  Alright, it's kind of...
[4118.77s -> 4120.77s]  Is this like... This looks like roadkill.
[4120.77s -> 4129.41s]  Is that like part of the thing
[4129.41s -> 4132.03s]  here? Steal the
[4132.03s -> 4135.04s]  wheel. Roll the wheel
[4135.04s -> 4139.84s]  off the cliff.
[4139.84s -> 4141.84s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[4141.84s -> 4146.82s]  Have another mango.
[4146.82s -> 4151.23s]  You killed him. Alright.
[4151.23s -> 4153.23s]  Very lively, not tired.
[4153.23s -> 4156.18s]  Focused. I think
[4156.18s -> 4159.31s]  it's time. Let's see if we can
[4159.31s -> 4161.31s]  win a tournament.
[4161.31s -> 4167.84s]  So, here we go.
[4167.84s -> 4169.84s]  Calendar of tournaments today.
[4169.84s -> 4171.84s]  There are four
[4171.84s -> 4175.42s]  rivals.
[4175.42s -> 4177.42s]  You're not really that
[4177.42s -> 4179.42s]  strong, but it's okay.
[4179.42s -> 4182.05s]  This is also... This is rest today.
[4182.05s -> 4186.96s]  Relax. Here we go.
[4186.96s -> 4198.16s]  Competition.
[4198.16s -> 4200.46s]  Single Battle
[4200.46s -> 4202.46s]  Hydrangia Cup.
[4202.46s -> 4204.46s]  Rumor is in it.
[4204.46s -> 4206.46s]  Take part in the scheduled competition.
[4206.46s -> 4208.46s]  Yes. Let's see if we can make something happen.
[4208.46s -> 4221.33s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[4221.33s -> 4223.33s]  here it is, the Hydrangia Cup.
[4223.33s -> 4226.14s]  Who will arise victorious?
[4226.14s -> 4228.14s]  There can only be one.
[4228.14s -> 4231.15s]  Now let the tournament begin. That's a weird
[4231.15s -> 4233.71s]  device around his neck.
[4233.71s -> 4236.46s]  Is that what he's yelling into?
[4236.46s -> 4238.46s]  That's like a weird... That's a weird microphone.
[4238.46s -> 4242.11s]  Alright, so we've got
[4242.11s -> 4244.11s]  Rumor, Cypher, Charon, and
[4244.11s -> 4247.50s]  Ober. Let's take a look at the info.
[4247.50s -> 4250.37s]  Enemy. So,
[4250.37s -> 4252.37s]  Cypher is a chump.
[4252.37s -> 4255.25s]  Low... I got higher power.
[4255.25s -> 4257.25s]  Low into... Yeah.
[4257.25s -> 4264.85s]  Life is not that bad.
[4264.85s -> 4267.47s]  I think this will be easy.
[4267.47s -> 4271.38s]  Give commands. Let's go.
[4271.38s -> 4275.92s]  35 speed.
[4275.92s -> 4277.92s]  Alright, Rumor. Let's fucking run him over.
[4277.92s -> 4280.93s]  Rumor versus Cypher.
[4280.93s -> 4284.58s]  Cypher looks like it is
[4284.58s -> 4286.58s]  in complete and total agony.
[4286.58s -> 4290.74s]  That thing is fucked up.
[4290.74s -> 4293.17s]  It's got five... One,
[4293.17s -> 4295.17s]  two, three, four, five faces probably?
[4295.17s -> 4297.17s]  Are the faces on the feet?
[4297.17s -> 4305.66s]  Here we go.
[4305.66s -> 4307.66s]  I'm trying to back it up. Guts 59.
[4307.66s -> 4309.90s]  Let's actually...
[4309.90s -> 4312.66s]  Let's get in closer.
[4312.66s -> 4316.82s]  Bullish. Backspin.
[4316.82s -> 4319.95s]  Nice!
[4319.95s -> 4324.88s]  Oh, that's a good move.
[4324.88s -> 4326.88s]  It just almost killed me.
[4326.88s -> 4328.88s]  I'm almost dead.
[4328.88s -> 4332.98s]  Okay. I gotta get in closer,
[4332.98s -> 4335.22s]  I think. Yeah, stay in close.
[4335.22s -> 4343.46s]  Got him.
[4343.46s -> 4347.23s]  Look at me! That was almost pretty
[4347.23s -> 4349.23s]  bad. Okay, who's next?
[4349.23s -> 4356.59s]  This is Charon and Ober.
[4356.59s -> 4359.73s]  I think it just tells you who wins.
[4359.73s -> 4362.74s]  Alright.
[4362.74s -> 4364.74s]  Looks like Ober has the upper hand here.
[4364.74s -> 4367.28s]  Ober wins.
[4367.28s -> 4369.28s]  So it's Rumor versus Ober in the championship for this.
[4369.28s -> 4376.51s]  Let's take a look at the other one.
[4376.51s -> 4378.51s]  I need more defense. I almost got one shot.
[4378.51s -> 4380.51s]  Alright, so this is a chump.
[4380.51s -> 4383.82s]  What kind of...
[4383.82s -> 4389.97s]  I think I'm ready.
[4389.97s -> 4399.82s]  Rumor versus Uber.
[4399.82s -> 4402.77s]  That's not a bad looking monster though.
[4402.77s -> 4404.77s]  Alright, let's see what they got.
[4404.77s -> 4406.77s]  Right in the middle, let's go right up front.
[4406.77s -> 4408.77s]  Started off with a drift.
[4408.77s -> 4411.52s]  I fucking crushed him again.
[4411.52s -> 4413.52s]  Don't even let him do anything. Again.
[4413.52s -> 4415.89s]  He blocked it.
[4415.89s -> 4418.70s]  Again. See you later.
[4418.70s -> 4433.23s]  Champion.
[4433.23s -> 4435.23s]  The winner of this terrific battle is
[4435.23s -> 4437.23s]  Rumor. Congratulations.
[4437.23s -> 4445.66s]  I've got really weird hands.
[4445.66s -> 4447.66s]  The timing, yeah.
[4447.66s -> 4449.66s]  800G and a potato.
[4449.66s -> 4452.99s]  Plus five fame for Rumor.
[4452.99s -> 4458.18s]  He was so happy he just
[4458.18s -> 4462.34s]  drove by the house.
[4462.34s -> 4464.34s]  InvincedGerman has a key to play the vroom noise.
[4464.34s -> 4467.28s]  No.
[4467.28s -> 4469.97s]  Nice work.
[4469.97s -> 4471.97s]  Let's take a look at the schedule.
[4471.97s -> 4474.59s]  Yeah, when's the next...
[4474.59s -> 4476.59s]  Wait, wait. When's the next tournament?
[4476.59s -> 4479.71s]  So I got a star.
[4479.71s -> 4481.71s]  This is...
[4481.71s -> 4483.71s]  Let's do... What's this one?
[4483.71s -> 4485.71s]  This is a single official grade E tournament.
[4485.71s -> 4487.71s]  This is the real one.
[4487.71s -> 4489.71s]  I think I can enter this though.
[4489.71s -> 4491.71s]  Because I have a star.
[4491.71s -> 4493.71s]  Can I enter this?
[4493.71s -> 4495.71s]  And just prepare for it?
[4495.71s -> 4498.91s]  The monster does not have enough points
[4498.91s -> 4500.91s]  to enter the official league battle.
[4500.91s -> 4502.91s]  Ah, fuck off.
[4502.91s -> 4507.78s]  Let's do this one.
[4507.78s -> 4510.91s]  We just have to stomp on him.
[4510.91s -> 4512.91s]  Alright, let's take a look at the schedule.
[4512.91s -> 4514.91s]  Let's do exercise and then rest.
[4514.91s -> 4517.47s]  No, exercise,
[4517.47s -> 4519.47s]  exercise, exercise, rest.
[4519.47s -> 4521.47s]  No, no, no, no.
[4521.47s -> 4523.47s]  Hold on.
[4523.47s -> 4525.47s]  I'm getting into this here. Hold on.
[4525.47s -> 4528.03s]  No, no, no.
[4528.03s -> 4530.03s]  What does he need?
[4530.03s -> 4534.00s]  Defense is terrible. Speed is terrible.
[4534.00s -> 4541.49s]  Let's do defense, defense.
[4551.90s -> 4553.90s]  Defense, defense.
[4553.90s -> 4556.51s]  Defense, rest.
[4556.51s -> 4558.82s]  Defense.
[4558.82s -> 4561.06s]  Let him have day off in the middle.
[4561.06s -> 4568.86s]  And then that night is the tournament.
[4568.86s -> 4570.86s]  You can have up to four monsters?
[4570.86s -> 4574.70s]  I thought...
[4574.70s -> 4576.70s]  I don't know if I have that unlocked yet.
[4576.70s -> 4579.90s]  Okay, that looks good.
[4579.90s -> 4582.72s]  Do I have food?
[4582.72s -> 4584.72s]  I have like a potato.
[4584.72s -> 4587.34s]  I just got my first money.
[4587.34s -> 4589.34s]  Alright, go for it.
[4589.34s -> 4594.34s]  Not that great.
[4594.34s -> 4602.51s]  Plus three defense.
[4602.51s -> 4604.51s]  This is like a fucking goofball.
[4604.51s -> 4607.65s]  What a goofy motherfucker.
[4607.65s -> 4609.65s]  Alright, let's do an okay. Let's pray.
[4609.65s -> 4614.51s]  Skold?
[4614.51s -> 4617.78s]  Well, it's not his fault.
[4617.78s -> 4619.78s]  He's like big, dumb, and slow.
[4619.78s -> 4621.78s]  He's not like the fastest.
[4621.78s -> 4623.78s]  He can't sprint around.
[4623.78s -> 4625.78s]  He uses his wheel.
[4625.78s -> 4627.78s]  I can't be mad that he's like too slow.
[4627.78s -> 4635.14s]  I'm spoiling him. Skold him.
[4635.14s -> 4637.14s]  No, I don't want to eat. He's my friend.
[4637.14s -> 4639.14s]  I'm not going to skold him.
[4639.14s -> 4641.63s]  Alright, food.
[4641.63s -> 4643.63s]  Oh shit, I can only do...
[4643.63s -> 4645.63s]  That's not good.
[4645.63s -> 4648.26s]  I can only...
[4648.26s -> 4650.26s]  Why can't I feed him?
[4650.26s -> 4655.31s]  I can only do one action
[4655.31s -> 4657.31s]  and feeding them is an action.
[4657.31s -> 4660.45s]  That's not good. Okay, well...
[4660.45s -> 4664.66s]  The tournament is
[4664.66s -> 4666.66s]  tomorrow.
[4666.66s -> 4668.66s]  So let's feed him.
[4670.83s -> 4674.80s]  Make him fear you.
[4674.80s -> 4677.17s]  Hey, you want to run your monster
[4677.17s -> 4679.17s]  village the way you want, I'm going to run my
[4679.17s -> 4681.17s]  monster village the way I want. Plus, this is like kind of...
[4681.17s -> 4683.73s]  This is like a little
[4683.73s -> 4690.88s]  janky looking...
[4690.88s -> 4713.22s]  See what I'm talking about here? That looks weird.
[4713.22s -> 4715.84s]  There we go. Okay, that's better.
[4715.84s -> 4718.85s]  Now it's not a bunch of like
[4718.85s -> 4721.92s]  black bars.
[4721.92s -> 4723.92s]  Now you can see better, can't you?
[4723.92s -> 4728.27s]  He's not very focused.
[4730.45s -> 4732.45s]  All I have is a potato.
[4741.14s -> 4743.14s]  That focused lively.
[4743.14s -> 4746.51s]  I think he's good to go.
[4746.51s -> 4751.82s]  So then this is the...
[4751.82s -> 4753.82s]  Is this the right week?
[4753.82s -> 4755.82s]  No, okay, it's tomorrow.
[4755.82s -> 4760.05s]  Yeah, it's tomorrow.
[4760.05s -> 4762.05s]  Yeah, he's in that one. Alright, we're good.
[4765.62s -> 4767.79s]  He's not dead.
[4767.79s -> 4773.17s]  He's fine.
[4777.17s -> 4779.17s]  Free food, good.
[4789.22s -> 4800.86s]  You come with the same
[4800.86s -> 4802.86s]  grocery list.
[4802.86s -> 4805.30s]  Alright, you're not hungry, you're not tired,
[4805.30s -> 4807.60s]  you're pretty focused.
[4807.60s -> 4811.18s]  And today was what?
[4811.18s -> 4813.74s]  Today was
[4813.74s -> 4815.74s]  training.
[4815.74s -> 4817.74s]  This is for, I believe, defense, right?
[4817.74s -> 4821.20s]  That's good.
[4821.20s -> 4824.46s]  Good. Five points.
[4824.46s -> 4827.02s]  Are you tired?
[4827.02s -> 4829.20s]  No, not really. Very lively.
[4829.20s -> 4831.20s]  Very lively.
[4831.20s -> 4834.72s]  Alright, let's go.
[4834.72s -> 4836.72s]  I'm not gonna do anything.
[4836.72s -> 4839.34s]  He's ready to fight.
[4839.34s -> 4843.44s]  I think we have to win
[4843.44s -> 4845.44s]  two or three of these before we can do the official tournament.
[4845.44s -> 4863.10s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[4863.10s -> 4865.10s]  representing the Bamboo Cup,
[4865.10s -> 4868.05s]  who will arise victorious?
[4868.05s -> 4870.54s]  They can only be won.
[4870.54s -> 4874.45s]  Let the tournament begin.
[4874.45s -> 4876.45s]  Rumor, Kylan, Gatti, and Yellow.
[4876.45s -> 4882.21s]  Oh, fuck, this is not good.
[4882.21s -> 4884.21s]  Okay, really high intelligence.
[4884.21s -> 4887.73s]  Low defense, though.
[4887.73s -> 4889.73s]  I think if I get two or three quick moves off,
[4889.73s -> 4892.48s]  like that, I'll probably bury him.
[4892.48s -> 4894.85s]  My intelligence is awful.
[4894.85s -> 4898.37s]  He's got Tail Whip,
[4898.37s -> 4901.76s]  Spit, and Kiss.
[4901.76s -> 4904.45s]  Kiss is the thing you want to look out for.
[4904.45s -> 4906.45s]  That's the only thing that does intelligence damage.
[4906.45s -> 4908.45s]  So wherever Kiss is on his slot...
[4908.45s -> 4910.69s]  Wait a minute.
[4910.69s -> 4912.69s]  I'm not even fighting this.
[4912.69s -> 4915.50s]  Alright, well, good luck, everybody.
[4919.20s -> 4921.20s]  No, what? No, no, no, no, no.
[4921.20s -> 4923.20s]  Shit, I wanted to give commands. I hate when it does that.
[4923.20s -> 4927.49s]  He's gonna always on his own.
[4927.49s -> 4935.04s]  I wanted to look at the other menu for a second.
[4935.04s -> 4937.04s]  Alright, good luck. Good luck, Rumor.
[4937.04s -> 4939.04s]  Don't get hit by anything.
[4939.04s -> 4943.52s]  Good job.
[4943.52s -> 4945.76s]  I'm so glad you're doing this.
[4945.76s -> 4947.76s]  I would have reacted five times faster than you.
[4947.76s -> 4949.76s]  Come on, do it again. Quick.
[4949.76s -> 4951.76s]  Don't let him do anything. Kill him.
[4951.76s -> 4953.76s]  Don't let him do his move. He's gonna do the Spit.
[4953.76s -> 4956.88s]  Do it. Do something.
[4956.88s -> 4958.88s]  Do it quick before you die. Do it.
[4958.88s -> 4961.44s]  Stop shifting.
[4961.44s -> 4963.44s]  Oh, thank god.
[4963.44s -> 4973.49s]  That almost was a disaster.
[4973.49s -> 4979.31s]  Okay. Don't yell at him.
[4986.08s -> 4988.08s]  Gatti just destroyed Kylon.
[4988.08s -> 4991.54s]  So Gatti's the one with the one win.
[4991.54s -> 4994.10s]  And it's the person we're about to face.
[4994.10s -> 4996.10s]  No, we're not.
[4996.10s -> 4998.59s]  Kylon versus Yellow.
[4998.59s -> 5002.80s]  Alright, so Yellow just sucks.
[5002.80s -> 5004.80s]  The high intelligence doesn't really matter at all.
[5004.80s -> 5008.05s]  Alright, here we go.
[5008.05s -> 5010.93s]  Info. Gatti.
[5010.93s -> 5014.96s]  Stats are very low.
[5014.96s -> 5017.26s]  Just fast.
[5017.26s -> 5035.50s]  But sometimes it's all it takes.
[5035.50s -> 5037.50s]  Is this the evolved version of the monster that I had
[5037.50s -> 5043.20s]  but without legs?
[5043.20s -> 5045.20s]  It looks like it. It looks like Snoopy's cousin.
[5045.20s -> 5047.76s]  But with no legs.
[5047.76s -> 5050.90s]  Spike. That just is Fireman.
[5050.90s -> 5055.95s]  No, if he had no arms it would be.
[5055.95s -> 5059.15s]  No, he does have legs.
[5059.15s -> 5061.15s]  No, not good. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.
[5061.15s -> 5067.73s]  You missed.
[5067.73s -> 5069.73s]  That was a yo-yo.
[5069.73s -> 5072.54s]  No, don't let him.
[5072.54s -> 5075.30s]  Alright, getting close and hitting with drift.
[5075.30s -> 5077.30s]  Oh, fuck. Back it up. Back it up.
[5077.30s -> 5080.11s]  I need more guts.
[5080.11s -> 5083.38s]  I haven't hit anything.
[5083.38s -> 5085.38s]  That's not good.
[5085.38s -> 5087.68s]  Get it. Yes.
[5087.68s -> 5090.18s]  One hit kill. Do it again.
[5090.18s -> 5092.18s]  I just made him mad.
[5092.18s -> 5094.72s]  Again?
[5094.72s -> 5097.09s]  No.
[5097.09s -> 5102.27s]  I got plenty of guts still. It's okay.
[5102.27s -> 5106.43s]  Is it the speed of the defense?
[5106.43s -> 5108.93s]  He's blocking everything.
[5108.93s -> 5114.56s]  Holy shit, man.
[5114.56s -> 5116.56s]  I'm almost out of guts.
[5116.56s -> 5121.22s]  He's just gonna wear me down.
[5121.22s -> 5123.22s]  Oh, shit. Okay, I have to hit him here.
[5123.22s -> 5126.46s]  Hit it.
[5126.46s -> 5135.62s]  Yes. Hurry.
[5135.62s -> 5140.27s]  Alright, that's two and all.
[5140.27s -> 5142.27s]  That's pretty much tournament victory as long as
[5142.27s -> 5144.27s]  I pretty much win.
[5144.27s -> 5147.92s]  Gatti in yellow.
[5147.92s -> 5151.87s]  Gatti loses?
[5151.87s -> 5155.14s]  Yeah, that's it. That's game over. I win.
[5155.14s -> 5157.14s]  The only way it's possible is if I lose to Kylon.
[5157.14s -> 5159.14s]  Which, I mean,
[5159.14s -> 5161.14s]  that's not gonna happen.
[5161.14s -> 5167.20s]  Well, it might.
[5167.20s -> 5169.20s]  168 accuracy, 133 speed.
[5169.20s -> 5171.76s]  Terrible power, though.
[5171.76s -> 5173.94s]  Kylon's moves are awful.
[5173.94s -> 5176.24s]  It's just a question of
[5176.24s -> 5178.24s]  not being able to hit them.
[5186.61s -> 5188.61s]  53 power. Yeah.
[5188.61s -> 5191.04s]  But my defense is bad, too, though.
[5191.04s -> 5195.50s]  It'll still hurt.
[5195.50s -> 5197.50s]  It's Vrombor versus Umbrella Head Dog.
[5197.50s -> 5201.02s]  Alright, we wanna
[5201.02s -> 5203.02s]  stay away from the one in the back.
[5203.02s -> 5209.94s]  Got it.
[5209.94s -> 5216.13s]  Damn.
[5216.13s -> 5220.10s]  There it is. Dude, again, quick. Don't even let him do anything.
[5220.10s -> 5222.72s]  Again.
[5222.72s -> 5225.47s]  Again.
[5225.47s -> 5227.47s]  Fuck. Alright.
[5227.47s -> 5231.50s]  I gotta learn a new move.
[5231.50s -> 5233.81s]  Stupid drift.
[5233.81s -> 5239.25s]  That's a victory.
[5239.25s -> 5245.65s]  The winner of this terrific battle
[5245.65s -> 5247.65s]  is Vrombor.
[5247.65s -> 5258.98s]  Congratulations. On cue.
[5258.98s -> 5260.98s]  I'm not doing that.
[5260.98s -> 5262.98s]  I'm not pressing a button to have a loud
[5262.98s -> 5265.79s]  engine sound.
[5265.79s -> 5268.80s]  Got a banana this time.
[5268.80s -> 5279.62s]  Five more fame points?
[5279.62s -> 5281.62s]  Vrombor's better than Beanbag Sonic, and that's
[5281.62s -> 5285.71s]  debatable. Nice work.
[5285.71s -> 5287.71s]  So, I think...
[5287.71s -> 5289.71s]  Let me see. I have two stars now.
[5289.71s -> 5291.71s]  What does it take? Official Cup?
[5291.71s -> 5293.71s]  No.
[5293.71s -> 5295.71s]  I need three stars.
[5295.71s -> 5297.71s]  When's the next Official Cup?
[5297.71s -> 5299.71s]  Oh, Jesus.
[5299.71s -> 5303.23s]  Official Grade E. When's the next
[5303.23s -> 5305.23s]  Official Grade E?
[5305.23s -> 5307.23s]  Oh, no.
[5307.23s -> 5309.73s]  That's not till October.
[5309.73s -> 5311.73s]  He's gonna
[5311.73s -> 5313.97s]  die.
[5313.97s -> 5315.97s]  Um.
[5315.97s -> 5317.97s]  Yeah, I'm gonna have to wait.
[5317.97s -> 5319.97s]  Wait.
[5319.97s -> 5321.97s]  Oh, you mean this July? No. There's no end.
[5321.97s -> 5323.97s]  There's this one here.
[5323.97s -> 5325.97s]  But I don't have enough.
[5325.97s -> 5327.97s]  We have to wait till October.
[5331.17s -> 5333.17s]  Dammit. Alright. Well.
[5333.17s -> 5339.30s]  Freeze him?
[5339.30s -> 5341.30s]  I don't know. Do you think I should freeze him now?
[5341.30s -> 5344.43s]  He's doing so well.
[5344.43s -> 5351.47s]  We got plenty of time to make more.
[5351.47s -> 5354.29s]  Not in his prime. Yeah.
[5354.29s -> 5356.29s]  Let me see the...
[5356.29s -> 5358.59s]  What do we need to build on here?
[5358.59s -> 5360.59s]  Power's good.
[5360.59s -> 5362.59s]  Defense could... Level 6 defense
[5362.59s -> 5364.59s]  is probably important. Speed is pretty
[5364.59s -> 5366.59s]  terrible as well. Intelligence is terrible.
[5366.59s -> 5368.90s]  Although I might get another move if I level up
[5368.90s -> 5373.12s]  power again.
[5373.12s -> 5377.73s]  I think.
[5377.73s -> 5381.50s]  I'm gonna try to get power to level 9.
[5381.50s -> 5383.50s]  Maybe life? Life is bad too.
[5383.50s -> 5385.50s]  Speed. There's so many things he needs.
[5389.28s -> 5392.35s]  Schedule it out. Alright. Let's do...
[5392.35s -> 5395.10s]  We have like
[5395.10s -> 5397.10s]  two months to get him there.
[5397.10s -> 5399.10s]  Let's do
[5399.10s -> 5401.10s]  speed. Speed.
[5401.10s -> 5405.38s]  Then...
[5405.38s -> 5407.38s]  Do speed twice. And then power.
[5407.38s -> 5411.02s]  Rest.
[5411.02s -> 5413.02s]  Rest in the middle of that.
[5417.02s -> 5419.02s]  And then we'll see where we're at.
[5419.02s -> 5423.62s]  Put in the stupid
[5423.62s -> 5425.62s]  invader's disc.
[5425.62s -> 5428.30s]  I have that here. I have a bunch of stuff.
[5428.30s -> 5430.86s]  That's a good increase.
[5430.86s -> 5436.69s]  Alright. Let's feed you.
[5436.69s -> 5440.34s]  We're doing okay.
[5442.34s -> 5444.34s]  Banana.
[5444.34s -> 5446.34s]  Sweet, nutritious banana from the
[5446.34s -> 5448.34s]  Parry jungle. Popular with kids.
[5448.34s -> 5450.34s]  Squid, beef.
[5450.34s -> 5452.58s]  Let's just... potato.
[5452.58s -> 5454.58s]  Let's save the good food for when we need it.
[5454.58s -> 5461.36s]  I do have Floydgan Brothers as well. You're right.
[5461.36s -> 5465.46s]  Let's continue.
[5470.37s -> 5472.37s]  Floydgan Brothers disc or riot.
[5472.37s -> 5479.09s]  Yeah. I'm gonna turn the web game on.
[5479.09s -> 5481.09s]  Just break it.
[5481.09s -> 5484.53s]  What was the training today?
[5484.53s -> 5489.26s]  Speed.
[5489.26s -> 5491.26s]  Alright.
[5491.26s -> 5498.37s]  Plus 6.
[5498.37s -> 5500.37s]  Tired. Good thing tomorrow's rest, right?
[5500.37s -> 5509.58s]  Put the other
[5509.58s -> 5512.14s]  monster ranchers in.
[5512.14s -> 5514.14s]  Yeah, there's a lot of options.
[5514.14s -> 5516.14s]  Once we get a decent...
[5516.14s -> 5518.14s]  How this game really functions is
[5518.14s -> 5520.14s]  you build up a
[5520.14s -> 5522.14s]  monster. You make them good.
[5522.14s -> 5524.14s]  You make them win. You get
[5524.14s -> 5526.14s]  a good start. You freeze them.
[5526.14s -> 5528.14s]  You make more and then you combine them.
[5528.14s -> 5530.38s]  To make a better one.
[5530.38s -> 5533.20s]  In the freezer.
[5533.20s -> 5538.70s]  Is he gonna start to rebel?
[5538.70s -> 5540.70s]  He's okay.
[5540.70s -> 5547.10s]  I can't believe the bootleg space channel 5
[5547.10s -> 5550.30s]  bullshit.
[5550.30s -> 5552.30s]  Okay, so he's tired. Today he was resting, right?
[5556.78s -> 5559.71s]  So rest.
[5559.71s -> 5561.71s]  Then it was power.
[5561.71s -> 5563.71s]  Rest and then
[5563.71s -> 5565.71s]  let's do defense twice.
[5570.02s -> 5572.02s]  And then we'll see where we are. Alright.
[5572.02s -> 5574.02s]  Here's the thing about 4.
[5574.02s -> 5576.32s]  I like how 4 you can batch
[5576.32s -> 5578.32s]  out stuff to do.
[5578.32s -> 5580.32s]  But I do miss the minigames.
[5580.32s -> 5582.32s]  I miss the fun little animations.
[5582.32s -> 5589.73s]  It's very lively. Good.
[5593.25s -> 5595.25s]  You good on food?
[5595.25s -> 5599.66s]  No, you're good. Let's go.
[5599.66s -> 5608.88s]  So today we've got
[5608.88s -> 5610.88s]  power
[5610.88s -> 5612.88s]  and then
[5612.88s -> 5614.88s]  I don't think you need to rest after this.
[5614.88s -> 5616.88s]  Power and then defense.
[5616.88s -> 5618.88s]  Power, defense, defense.
[5618.88s -> 5622.19s]  Hopefully we learn a new move.
[5622.19s -> 5624.19s]  Did you learn new moves? You have to, right?
[5624.19s -> 5629.31s]  Level 9, there it is.
[5629.31s -> 5631.31s]  Alright. Something new.
[5631.31s -> 5638.02s]  Did you learn to move?
[5638.02s -> 5640.02s]  Go to the shrine and make more insults to
[5640.02s -> 5642.02s]  God.
[5642.02s -> 5645.22s]  I will, I will.
[5645.22s -> 5651.94s]  I promise.
[5651.94s -> 5654.24s]  Let me just see. Did you get any new moves?
[5654.24s -> 5658.46s]  You only have
[5658.46s -> 5660.46s]  these two moves.
[5660.46s -> 5662.46s]  Nothing else?
[5662.46s -> 5672.24s]  Is it pee time
[5672.24s -> 5674.24s]  yet? I wanna get a drink. Ah, it will be in a
[5674.24s -> 5684.35s]  second.
[5684.35s -> 5686.35s]  Is it defense day? Level 6. Yes.
[5686.35s -> 5693.39s]  It's almost time to pee.
[5693.39s -> 5695.39s]  You need to eat.
[5695.39s -> 5697.39s]  Have a potato.
[5697.39s -> 5705.97s]  Okay, you're good.
[5705.97s -> 5707.97s]  Well, you're just okay, but that's fine.
[5707.97s -> 5717.38s]  I need to do one more
[5717.38s -> 5719.38s]  tournament before I can do the...
[5719.38s -> 5721.38s]  Let's pick like a shitty tournament and just steamroll
[5721.38s -> 5725.09s]  everybody.
[5725.09s -> 5727.09s]  Scold him for daring to ask for food.
[5727.09s -> 5729.09s]  You are...
[5729.09s -> 5731.09s]  You are awful.
[5731.09s -> 5733.09s]  That's an awful thing to say.
[5733.09s -> 5736.16s]  That's just awful.
[5736.16s -> 5738.85s]  More defense.
[5738.85s -> 5746.40s]  You're good.
[5746.40s -> 5748.40s]  Let me see the schedule. Alright, so...
[5748.40s -> 5750.64s]  Calendar.
[5754.78s -> 5756.78s]  What do we got?
[5756.78s -> 5758.78s]  Okay, so we have
[5758.78s -> 5760.78s]  September.
[5760.78s -> 5762.78s]  October.
[5762.78s -> 5764.78s]  So we need to do...
[5764.78s -> 5766.78s]  Where are we? We're here.
[5766.78s -> 5768.78s]  We'll just do this one.
[5768.78s -> 5770.78s]  We'll go...
[5770.78s -> 5772.78s]  We'll go just make fools out of everybody
[5772.78s -> 5774.78s]  here. We'll go embarrass everyone here.
[5774.78s -> 5776.78s]  Probably get booed and shit, but whatever. Who cares?
[5776.78s -> 5779.22s]  Making money, right?
[5784.22s -> 5786.22s]  Okay, he's signed up for that one.
[5786.22s -> 5788.22s]  Let's get out of here.
[5796.35s -> 5799.17s]  Training!
[5799.17s -> 5801.47s]  What were you doing today?
[5801.47s -> 5806.34s]  Defense, right? Very good.
[5806.34s -> 5812.42s]  He's very tired.
[5812.42s -> 5820.21s]  You gotta get three stars?
[5820.21s -> 5822.21s]  Why would they boo?
[5822.21s -> 5824.45s]  Um...
[5824.45s -> 5826.45s]  Because I'm going in there with a very strong Pokemon.
[5826.45s -> 5829.26s]  The strongest, it's possible.
[5829.26s -> 5833.34s]  Alright, we need a day of rest.
[5833.34s -> 5840.13s]  Fail?
[5840.13s -> 5842.13s]  Oh, no. Fall.
[5842.13s -> 5844.13s]  It's like, how did I fail?
[5846.82s -> 5848.82s]  Rest.
[5848.82s -> 5855.97s]  Who cares if people like you
[5855.97s -> 5857.97s]  if you're making cheddar?
[5857.97s -> 5861.94s]  Well, that, I mean...
[5861.94s -> 5864.88s]  I need money. This is a game about money.
[5864.88s -> 5866.88s]  Let's feed you
[5866.88s -> 5868.88s]  a potato.
[5868.88s -> 5870.88s]  And then let's go kick some ass.
[5870.88s -> 5873.82s]  And then after I kick everybody's ass
[5873.82s -> 5877.09s]  in this tournament, I'm gonna go pee.
[5881.74s -> 5884.05s]  Competition.
[5884.05s -> 5892.50s]  Take part in the competition.
[5892.50s -> 5901.78s]  The Autumn Festival.
[5901.78s -> 5903.78s]  Welcome to the Autumn Festival. Who will arise victorious
[5903.78s -> 5905.78s]  that can only be won? Now let the tournament begin.
[5905.78s -> 5908.46s]  Clay,
[5908.46s -> 5910.46s]  Decker,
[5910.46s -> 5912.70s]  and Chara. Look at Chara's icon.
[5912.70s -> 5916.35s]  That looks fucking terrifying.
[5916.35s -> 5921.15s]  What an extreme emoji.
[5921.15s -> 5923.15s]  Alright, let's see.
[5923.15s -> 5925.78s]  This is Clay.
[5925.78s -> 5927.78s]  I'll kill it in two hits.
[5927.78s -> 5934.94s]  You know what? One hit, probably.
[5934.94s -> 5938.14s]  This is the equivalent.
[5938.14s -> 5940.14s]  You know when you played Little League?
[5940.14s -> 5942.14s]  And some of the coaches
[5942.14s -> 5944.64s]  and some of the parents?
[5944.64s -> 5946.64s]  The age range for Little League was
[5946.64s -> 5948.64s]  like 10 to 13 years old.
[5948.64s -> 5951.01s]  And there was the people that
[5951.01s -> 5953.01s]  wanted to have their like 15-year-old
[5953.01s -> 5955.01s]  pretend to be a 12-year-old and be on teams.
[5955.01s -> 5957.57s]  And just decimate. It was bullshit.
[5957.57s -> 5959.57s]  I don't know why people wanted to do that.
[5959.57s -> 5964.18s]  But that's what we're doing right now.
[5964.18s -> 5966.18s]  We're faking to be like a 10-year-old
[5966.18s -> 5968.18s]  as like a 14-year-old.
[5968.18s -> 5970.66s]  Like look, that didn't even hurt.
[5970.66s -> 5977.94s]  Come on.
[5977.94s -> 5985.04s]  He ain't got nothing on him.
[5985.04s -> 5987.04s]  Rumor. I want to end this with like
[5987.04s -> 5989.04s]  me killing this creature.
[5989.04s -> 5995.30s]  There we go.
[5995.30s -> 5997.66s]  No.
[5997.66s -> 5999.66s]  I wouldn't do such overkill.
[5999.66s -> 6003.70s]  Yeah, there we go. He's fighting infants.
[6003.70s -> 6006.45s]  I don't know. I don't understand.
[6006.45s -> 6008.45s]  He's batting 6.88.
[6008.45s -> 6010.45s]  He has 48
[6010.45s -> 6014.22s]  home runs.
[6014.22s -> 6016.22s]  He reaches base almost
[6016.22s -> 6018.22s]  8 out of 10 times he's at the plate.
[6018.22s -> 6020.22s]  He's like 5 feet tall
[6020.22s -> 6028.67s]  than everybody.
[6028.67s -> 6030.98s]  I wanted to see
[6030.98s -> 6033.41s]  that face though.
[6033.41s -> 6035.41s]  Chara looks really interesting.
[6035.41s -> 6038.93s]  This is Decker. Decker is actually pretty strong.
[6038.93s -> 6042.38s]  This is a scenario where whoever
[6042.38s -> 6047.38s]  gets the first two hits is going to win.
[6047.38s -> 6049.38s]  159 power.
[6049.38s -> 6052.30s]  Well, shit, that's not good.
[6052.30s -> 6054.30s]  We have the same build.
[6054.30s -> 6060.00s]  Both bad defense, no intelligence though.
[6060.00s -> 6067.17s]  Decker looks like
[6067.17s -> 6069.86s]  a child's drawing
[6069.86s -> 6077.86s]  of a ninja turtle.
[6077.86s -> 6080.48s]  This is Michelangelo.
[6080.48s -> 6082.48s]  Alright, no more fucking around. I actually have to focus here.
[6082.48s -> 6086.45s]  Whoever gets the first hit
[6086.45s -> 6089.20s]  is going to get it. Bingo.
[6089.20s -> 6091.20s]  Nice. Alright, again. Quick.
[6091.20s -> 6094.53s]  Go, go, go, go. No, no, no, no.
[6094.53s -> 6096.53s]  That's not good. Alright, I gotta kill
[6096.53s -> 6098.53s]  him here. He's gotta die here.
[6098.53s -> 6100.90s]  Oh, this is bad. Back it up.
[6100.90s -> 6102.90s]  Back it up. Do it.
[6102.90s -> 6104.90s]  No. No.
[6104.90s -> 6106.90s]  Please. I win.
[6106.90s -> 6111.57s]  We both have the philosophy of
[6111.57s -> 6113.57s]  try to kill people in one hit
[6113.57s -> 6117.09s]  or two hits or you lose.
[6117.09s -> 6119.39s]  Alright, we got three under our belt now.
[6119.39s -> 6125.34s]  Time for an official championship.
[6125.34s -> 6127.71s]  I thought we should go to town and buy some stuff.
[6129.78s -> 6133.30s]  Oh, Jesus. KDK.
[6133.30s -> 6135.30s]  KDKD.
[6135.30s -> 6137.61s]  945. 20 community subs.
[6137.61s -> 6142.47s]  20.
[6142.47s -> 6148.41s]  Thank you, KDK.
[6148.41s -> 6155.64s]  For the insane amount of subs.
[6155.64s -> 6158.26s]  Call me KD.
[6158.26s -> 6160.26s]  Alright, KD. Well, it's KDKD.
[6160.26s -> 6162.57s]  It's KDK.
[6162.57s -> 6167.43s]  But thank you, KD. I'll call you KD
[6167.43s -> 6169.43s]  from now on.
[6169.43s -> 6172.12s]  Really? Dermal lied about
[6172.12s -> 6174.42s]  Minecraft VR. 21
[6174.42s -> 6178.58s]  community subs. 21?
[6178.58s -> 6182.04s]  Not necessary, but thank you.
[6182.04s -> 6187.35s]  That's a
[6187.35s -> 6189.59s]  sub war. Alright.
[6189.59s -> 6191.59s]  That's a fucking shitload of money. Thank you, guys.
[6194.09s -> 6196.09s]  My god.
[6196.09s -> 6199.03s]  Alright, I gotta pee.
[6199.03s -> 6201.98s]  I'll be back in like a minute or two.
[6201.98s -> 6203.98s]  Gonna refill my cup here.
[6203.98s -> 6206.28s]  Take a piss.
[6206.28s -> 6425.54s]  See you in two minutes.
[6425.54s -> 6437.05s]  Hello. Ooh.
[6437.05s -> 6445.43s]  You guys have had this music on the whole time, huh?
[6445.43s -> 6447.43s]  Oh, yeah. I don't know what's going on with the internet.
[6447.43s -> 6449.93s]  I don't know.
[6449.93s -> 6456.65s]  Are we still good?
[6456.65s -> 6466.74s]  This is bad.
[6466.74s -> 6468.74s]  Hold on one second.
[6468.74s -> 6503.75s]  Give me a second.
[6503.75s -> 6505.75s]  Well, I don't know what's going on with the internet, but
[6505.75s -> 6507.75s]  apparently, I've got like a bright red bar right now.
[6507.75s -> 6510.95s]  Strangely enough.
[6510.95s -> 6512.95s]  More subs came in?
[6512.95s -> 6517.37s]  Goodness, thank you.
[6517.37s -> 6519.37s]  KD for the 20 more community subs.
[6519.37s -> 6521.86s]  Before that, too.
[6521.86s -> 6525.19s]  The ball of koala.
[6525.19s -> 6528.14s]  Was this 20?
[6528.14s -> 6533.58s]  Holy shit, guys.
[6533.58s -> 6535.58s]  This is like really fucked up right now.
[6535.58s -> 6540.87s]  I'm dropping like
[6540.87s -> 6542.87s]  so many frames at the moment.
[6542.87s -> 6546.46s]  Is it okay now?
[6546.46s -> 6551.06s]  I think it's alright now.
[6551.06s -> 6553.06s]  Might be one of those days, apparently.
[6553.06s -> 6556.65s]  For some reason.
[6556.65s -> 6558.65s]  That's like 200 fucking subs today.
[6558.65s -> 6560.65s]  150, something like that.
[6560.65s -> 6562.65s]  For community subs.
[6562.65s -> 6564.65s]  Ball of koala, KD.
[6564.65s -> 6569.75s]  Thank you both.
[6569.75s -> 6572.31s]  Let's keep going.
[6572.31s -> 6574.55s]  Our wheel skunk.
[6574.55s -> 6576.55s]  I don't even know what the hell this thing is.
[6576.55s -> 6582.70s]  Alright, so today's the day, right?
[6582.70s -> 6585.64s]  No, no, no. Today's not the day.
[6585.64s -> 6587.64s]  Today we have a calendar.
[6587.64s -> 6590.33s]  Here we go.
[6590.33s -> 6592.33s]  This is the one I'm signing up for.
[6592.33s -> 6594.33s]  Six battles.
[6594.33s -> 6596.33s]  Sign up for it. I want to be prepared for this.
[6596.33s -> 6598.82s]  So we got
[6598.82s -> 6600.82s]  a couple here.
[6600.82s -> 6602.82s]  We have one, two, three, four.
[6602.82s -> 6604.82s]  We've got about four or five weeks.
[6604.82s -> 6606.82s]  Let's rest up.
[6606.82s -> 6608.82s]  And get to D rank.
[6608.82s -> 6610.82s]  Hopefully we get there.
[6610.82s -> 6615.24s]  So let's start with
[6615.24s -> 6618.38s]  no, no, no. What's the schedule?
[6618.38s -> 6620.38s]  High jump, yeah.
[6620.38s -> 6622.62s]  High jump, high jump, rest.
[6622.62s -> 6624.62s]  And then we're going to do exercise.
[6624.62s -> 6626.79s]  That sounds good.
[6626.79s -> 6628.79s]  Tournament's here.
[6628.79s -> 6630.79s]  Let's rest
[6630.79s -> 6633.03s]  here.
[6633.03s -> 6635.03s]  Work your
[6635.03s -> 6637.03s]  ass off for a couple days.
[6637.03s -> 6639.03s]  And then rest on the day of the tournament.
[6639.03s -> 6641.03s]  Alright, I think that's a good schedule.
[6641.03s -> 6643.03s]  Begin.
[6643.03s -> 6649.61s]  Plus ten speed, that's really good.
[6649.61s -> 6651.61s]  Let me see here.
[6660.18s -> 6663.19s]  Have a potato.
[6665.69s -> 6667.69s]  Twenty more community subs
[6667.69s -> 6669.69s]  from KD.
[6669.69s -> 6672.18s]  KD, what on earth?
[6672.18s -> 6676.22s]  Twenty more.
[6676.22s -> 6679.42s]  A hundred and fifteen total.
[6679.42s -> 6681.42s]  Holy shit, dude.
[6681.42s -> 6683.78s]  Holy shit, dude.
[6683.78s -> 6687.30s]  That's a ton. Thank you so much
[6687.30s -> 6689.30s]  for the twenty more fucking community subs.
[6689.30s -> 6694.04s]  Holy shit.
[6701.13s -> 6703.13s]  I hate this
[6703.13s -> 6705.13s]  monster for no reason. Why?
[6705.13s -> 6709.99s]  Why do you hate this one?
[6709.99s -> 6726.44s]  I like this one.
[6726.44s -> 6728.44s]  I mean, it is kind of big on the screen,
[6728.44s -> 6730.94s]  but still.
[6730.94s -> 6732.94s]  You don't like
[6732.94s -> 6734.94s]  Smoochy from Death to Smoochy?
[6734.94s -> 6741.64s]  That's what it looks like.
[6741.64s -> 6743.64s]  Alright, looks good. Let's go.
[6745.64s -> 6752.87s]  Ten more speed.
[6752.87s -> 6754.87s]  He's very good with speed.
[6754.87s -> 6761.34s]  He's very, very
[6761.34s -> 6763.58s]  attentive to how fast he can go.
[6763.58s -> 6765.58s]  I mean, he does have a wheel, so that makes sense.
[6768.97s -> 6774.09s]  Alright, you can rest.
[6774.09s -> 6776.09s]  That's a boomer reference?
[6776.09s -> 6779.03s]  That's not a boomer reference.
[6779.03s -> 6783.30s]  How is that a boomer reference?
[6783.30s -> 6785.30s]  It's like
[6785.30s -> 6787.30s]  a Danny DeVito movie.
[6787.30s -> 6789.30s]  I love Danny DeVito. He's still relevant.
[6789.30s -> 6795.77s]  Alright, rest, right?
[6795.77s -> 6797.77s]  No, rest here.
[6797.77s -> 6806.41s]  Sounds pretty good.
[6806.41s -> 6811.21s]  I'm ready. Go to sleep.
[6811.21s -> 6815.11s]  You skitch.
[6815.11s -> 6818.95s]  You just did the sloppy joke thing.
[6818.95s -> 6820.95s]  I love that lady. That's my favorite
[6820.95s -> 6825.37s]  character probably ever.
[6825.37s -> 6827.37s]  I know you skitch. Like a
[6827.37s -> 6830.38s]  sloppy.
[6830.38s -> 6836.90s]  Hey lady, you're scaring us. Billy Madison?
[6836.90s -> 6841.69s]  Come on.
[6841.69s -> 6844.63s]  The lady. The lunch lady
[6844.63s -> 6847.83s]  from Billy Madison.
[6847.83s -> 6849.83s]  Wow, I
[6849.83s -> 6852.46s]  am old apparently.
[6852.46s -> 6856.74s]  Alright, what do you need? Nothing?
[6856.74s -> 6858.74s]  No, you don't need food. You're good.
[6858.74s -> 6868.71s]  Somebody just said it took me
[6868.71s -> 6870.71s]  twenty days to finish
[6870.71s -> 6875.38s]  the Seaman book.
[6875.38s -> 6877.38s]  Why? Is that because
[6877.38s -> 6879.38s]  you didn't like it?
[6879.38s -> 6881.38s]  Were you forcing yourself
[6881.38s -> 6884.07s]  to watch it?
[6884.07s -> 6886.44s]  Keeping up the good work.
[6886.44s -> 6890.34s]  This guy just brings food.
[6890.34s -> 6892.34s]  Last game you had to buy food. I have a
[6892.34s -> 6895.22s]  surplus of food. This guy just keeps
[6895.22s -> 6897.22s]  bringing the same recipes every day.
[6897.22s -> 6899.22s]  Or every month. Or every like couple months.
[6899.22s -> 6903.83s]  I don't even know. Every season?
[6903.83s -> 6905.83s]  Twenty days. Alright, we got two trains
[6905.83s -> 6915.11s]  and then a rest. Or should I try to get
[6915.11s -> 6917.61s]  power to level ten?
[6917.61s -> 6919.61s]  Just go absolute fucking hammer.
[6919.61s -> 6925.37s]  What do you think?
[6925.37s -> 6929.34s]  Hmm. I think we're going to do
[6929.34s -> 6932.02s]  power again.
[6932.02s -> 6940.14s]  Yeah, I want to get to
[6940.14s -> 6942.14s]  level ten.
[6942.14s -> 6945.08s]  Rest, and then that's the official
[6945.08s -> 6947.32s]  tournament. Come on, level ten power.
[6947.32s -> 6951.48s]  Give me a new move. Yes!
[6951.48s -> 6955.64s]  New move. Give me a new move.
[6955.64s -> 6964.92s]  How do you learn new moves in this game?
[6964.92s -> 6966.92s]  Yeah, no big deal. Just another
[6966.92s -> 6968.92s]  twenty community subs from Katie.
[6968.92s -> 6972.36s]  Again. Twenty more.
[6972.36s -> 6977.35s]  Holy shit, man.
[6977.35s -> 6980.92s]  Twenty more.
[6980.92s -> 6983.16s]  Let's give him some food.
[6983.16s -> 6987.26s]  I can't. I can do it tomorrow.
[6987.26s -> 6989.26s]  Katie must have robbed a bank.
[6989.26s -> 6997.26s]  This game looks like Sekiro, but
[6997.26s -> 7001.93s]  good.
[7003.93s -> 7005.93s]  This game looks like Sekiro.
[7005.93s -> 7007.93s]  Five more from Katie.
[7007.93s -> 7010.55s]  Five more community subs
[7010.55s -> 7012.55s]  to top it all off.
[7012.55s -> 7018.12s]  Holy shit. Thank you, Katie.
[7018.12s -> 7024.33s]  His bank is going to
[7024.33s -> 7036.42s]  block his card.
[7036.42s -> 7038.84s]  Bill Gates.
[7038.84s -> 7040.84s]  Some of you guys
[7040.84s -> 7042.84s]  have given
[7042.84s -> 7045.08s]  like extreme amounts
[7045.08s -> 7047.08s]  of money. How about some beef? Yeah!
[7047.08s -> 7050.92s]  Before the tournament,
[7050.92s -> 7053.16s]  let's carb up. He didn't like that.
[7053.16s -> 7062.50s]  It's because he's a vegan.
[7062.50s -> 7065.58s]  Well, he's focused now. He's just having a rest.
[7065.58s -> 7068.65s]  He's fine. Yeah, he's ready to go, right?
[7068.65s -> 7070.65s]  Let's make sure.
[7070.65s -> 7073.14s]  Yeah. No, he's ready.
[7073.14s -> 7075.32s]  Let's go. First official
[7075.32s -> 7078.46s]  tournament. Six rivals.
[7078.46s -> 7080.46s]  A thousand dollars
[7080.46s -> 7082.46s]  for an item.
[7082.46s -> 7084.46s]  Official Grady. Let's move out of Grady.
[7084.46s -> 7091.05s]  Ten more subs from Jeremiah
[7091.05s -> 7094.18s]  about Minecraft VR. You guys
[7094.18s -> 7096.18s]  are just playing like sub-asteroids
[7096.18s -> 7099.96s]  right now with each other.
[7099.96s -> 7106.04s]  Thank you, both of you. The official
[7106.04s -> 7108.04s]  grade rank E tournament. The winner of this
[7108.04s -> 7110.04s]  tournament will receive a voucher for rank D.
[7110.04s -> 7112.22s]  Let's give it our best.
[7112.22s -> 7114.39s]  Begin the official grade rank E.
[7114.39s -> 7116.39s]  There we go.
[7116.39s -> 7119.59s]  Vroomer, Harris, Schmolet,
[7119.59s -> 7122.15s]  Judith, Lefort,
[7122.15s -> 7124.52s]  and Sunny.
[7124.52s -> 7129.45s]  This is against Sunny.
[7129.45s -> 7131.45s]  Low intelligence, low accuracy.
[7131.45s -> 7134.84s]  Really high power and high
[7134.84s -> 7138.10s]  health. What about me?
[7140.10s -> 7142.73s]  I've got really high power,
[7142.73s -> 7144.73s]  really kind of low
[7144.73s -> 7146.73s]  health. That's going to be the downfall
[7146.73s -> 7148.73s]  for me, I think. I've got to start to level that up.
[7148.73s -> 7151.74s]  And intelligence.
[7151.74s -> 7153.98s]  Alright.
[7153.98s -> 7157.43s]  What do you go for moves? High
[7157.43s -> 7159.43s]  power, so that means you want to be getting in.
[7159.43s -> 7161.43s]  Alright, he's got
[7161.43s -> 7164.70s]  a lot of moves. This is
[7164.70s -> 7167.19s]  going to be tough. Let's see if I can get a couple
[7167.19s -> 7180.82s]  of hits on him.
[7180.82s -> 7187.61s]  Okay.
[7187.61s -> 7189.61s]  You're dead. Your spine
[7189.61s -> 7193.77s]  is going to shatter. Why did I come up with
[7193.77s -> 7197.99s]  a pirate ship? Oh no, it's a
[7197.99s -> 7200.49s]  Sonic. It's Sunny the
[7200.49s -> 7204.78s]  Sonic dog.
[7204.78s -> 7207.08s]  This is some rivalry here.
[7207.08s -> 7213.40s]  Here we go. Start it off
[7213.40s -> 7216.86s]  quick.
[7216.86s -> 7219.54s]  Nice. Let me see if I can finish it with the
[7219.54s -> 7221.54s]  backspin.
[7221.54s -> 7227.54s]  Try it again.
[7227.54s -> 7231.83s]  Not good. Get in close.
[7231.83s -> 7235.16s]  Yes.
[7235.16s -> 7237.16s]  Final Guts.
[7237.16s -> 7239.16s]  What the fuck does that mean? What?
[7239.16s -> 7241.16s]  Oh, not good.
[7241.16s -> 7244.49s]  Thank god, he revived and I still got him.
[7244.49s -> 7251.08s]  Final Guts.
[7251.08s -> 7253.58s]  That's some weird technique.
[7253.58s -> 7257.74s]  He's going to be hard. Come back with one
[7257.74s -> 7261.26s]  health. Harris versus Lefort.
[7261.26s -> 7263.88s]  Lefort just beat
[7263.88s -> 7266.25s]  Harris. 0-1.
[7266.25s -> 7269.32s]  These two. Judith and Smollett.
[7269.32s -> 7273.22s]  Pretty one-sided
[7273.22s -> 7277.00s]  fight there. Lefort and
[7277.00s -> 7279.00s]  Judith. Me, Lefort and Judith are the only
[7279.00s -> 7284.18s]  ones that have wins.
[7284.18s -> 7286.18s]  That just went to
[7286.18s -> 7288.18s]  time, I think. Sunny wins.
[7288.18s -> 7291.64s]  Here we go. So now
[7291.64s -> 7293.64s]  we get to see one of these weirdos.
[7293.64s -> 7296.20s]  Rumor versus Lefort.
[7296.20s -> 7298.20s]  Wrong thing.
[7300.20s -> 7303.78s]  That's a ton of intelligence.
[7303.78s -> 7305.78s]  I have to avoid all those int moves.
[7305.78s -> 7307.78s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR just gave
[7307.78s -> 7309.78s]  15 community subs. 10 and then 5.
[7309.78s -> 7313.16s]  More.
[7313.16s -> 7315.66s]  15 more subs.
[7315.66s -> 7318.79s]  Just dropping them everywhere.
[7318.79s -> 7320.79s]  You're just driving by in a blimp.
[7320.79s -> 7323.29s]  The two years, the three years
[7323.29s -> 7325.29s]  tonight. Or just slowly going by
[7325.29s -> 7327.29s]  in a blimp and throwing out like
[7327.29s -> 7329.29s]  ten dollar bills over like a crowd.
[7329.29s -> 7339.21s]  But then
[7339.21s -> 7341.21s]  I come in with a vacuum
[7341.21s -> 7343.45s]  and I
[7343.45s -> 7345.45s]  have a giant fucking Dr. Eggman
[7345.45s -> 7347.45s]  vacuum that I suck up all the money
[7347.45s -> 7349.45s]  and I stand at a podium and go
[7349.45s -> 7351.45s]  but here are emotes!
[7351.45s -> 7353.45s]  And everyone's like fucking screaming at me. That was
[7353.45s -> 7363.88s]  my fucking money!
[7367.70s -> 7369.70s]  Adventure Dan. Thank you Adventure MF Dan.
[7369.70s -> 7373.86s]  Stop taking
[7373.86s -> 7376.30s]  their money. This guy's
[7376.30s -> 7378.30s]  gonna kill us. I need to be
[7378.30s -> 7380.54s]  aware of this intelligent move.
[7380.54s -> 7382.54s]  The green moves try to stay away from me.
[7382.54s -> 7387.91s]  Thank you so much Adventure Dan.
[7387.91s -> 7391.94s]  Where's my fucking money, Dan?
[7391.94s -> 7395.66s]  Put on facecam?
[7395.66s -> 7398.09s]  Dude, I wish
[7398.09s -> 7401.80s]  we had one of these
[7401.80s -> 7403.80s]  like pumpkin ducks. What is this?
[7403.80s -> 7408.86s]  That's the weirdest thing
[7408.86s -> 7414.17s]  I've ever seen. Alright, intelligent
[7414.17s -> 7416.17s]  move is not on the list right now.
[7416.17s -> 7418.17s]  Let's see if we can get it.
[7418.17s -> 7420.86s]  Do it again. Not even a chance.
[7423.10s -> 7425.10s]  No, he blocked it with his
[7425.10s -> 7428.94s]  body. I'm gonna take a
[7428.94s -> 7430.94s]  hit here. Not just staying close.
[7430.94s -> 7432.94s]  He doesn't have a move close.
[7432.94s -> 7446.22s]  Goodbye.
[7446.22s -> 7456.26s]  Go back to Cuphead. Imagine
[7456.26s -> 7458.26s]  gifting subs in 2019.
[7458.26s -> 7460.26s]  Laughing my ass off. What?
[7460.26s -> 7466.41s]  I think Sunny's gonna be the one we have to fight
[7466.41s -> 7470.18s]  in the championship here.
[7470.18s -> 7473.00s]  It's all about the power. Alright, Judith.
[7473.00s -> 7475.00s]  What do you got?
[7475.00s -> 7478.84s]  An exceptionally
[7478.84s -> 7481.85s]  high intelligence.
[7481.85s -> 7483.85s]  To a point where I would probably get one shot
[7483.85s -> 7485.85s]  by any of the inf moves. What do you have
[7485.85s -> 7487.85s]  for intelligence moves though, that's the question.
[7487.85s -> 7492.07s]  Almost everything.
[7492.07s -> 7496.15s]  So,
[7496.15s -> 7498.52s]  all those green moves
[7498.52s -> 7501.40s]  are devastating to me. I have
[7501.40s -> 7503.40s]  to try to keep in the range of Windy Lance,
[7503.40s -> 7510.89s]  whatever it is.
[7510.89s -> 7512.89s]  Chunky Baloney, 50 bucks from
[7512.89s -> 7515.38s]  Chunky Baloney. Thank you for the 5,000
[7515.38s -> 7517.38s]  bits. Chunky Baloney.
[7517.38s -> 7519.82s]  I tried to donate this money to the local
[7519.82s -> 7521.82s]  animal shelter, but your vacuum sucked it up.
[7521.82s -> 7531.22s]  My, like, money vacuum.
[7531.22s -> 7538.84s]  Get in close.
[7538.84s -> 7540.84s]  Everything she has is an intelligence. I gotta just try to end this
[7540.84s -> 7542.84s]  quick. No, this is bad.
[7542.84s -> 7547.62s]  All the way in the back.
[7547.62s -> 7549.62s]  She's got nothing, she's got no long range moves.
[7549.62s -> 7551.93s]  I only have a 27%
[7551.93s -> 7553.93s]  chance to hit with this. Holy shit, I got it.
[7553.93s -> 7556.36s]  This is just a Hail Mary right here, I have to do it.
[7556.36s -> 7561.93s]  Stay far away,
[7561.93s -> 7563.93s]  stay still, let me build up some guts.
[7563.93s -> 7565.93s]  Do it.
[7565.93s -> 7568.94s]  No! Alright,
[7568.94s -> 7573.74s]  get back in close, back in close.
[7573.74s -> 7576.87s]  In close again. Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[7576.87s -> 7578.87s]  I will do a war here.
[7578.87s -> 7581.30s]  No!
[7581.30s -> 7585.78s]  Get in close.
[7585.78s -> 7591.10s]  All it takes is one move.
[7591.10s -> 7594.68s]  No, shit!
[7594.68s -> 7597.11s]  Oh, I'm 18 seconds.
[7597.11s -> 7602.81s]  Oh, please.
[7602.81s -> 7608.44s]  Stay back, stay back.
[7608.44s -> 7610.87s]  Get in close.
[7610.87s -> 7612.87s]  Five, four,
[7612.87s -> 7614.87s]  three, two,
[7614.87s -> 7616.87s]  whoa! I win.
[7616.87s -> 7621.48s]  Wait, it's percentage based, right?
[7621.48s -> 7628.70s]  Yes.
[7628.70s -> 7630.70s]  Don't waste guts? Yeah, I just,
[7630.70s -> 7632.70s]  I saw the, I saw the
[7632.70s -> 7639.03s]  opportunity. 20 more subs
[7639.03s -> 7642.49s]  from Katie.
[7642.49s -> 7647.54s]  Oh my god.
[7647.54s -> 7649.54s]  Jesus Christ.
[7649.54s -> 7652.30s]  That's so many. I'm trying to have
[7652.30s -> 7654.30s]  everybody be a sub on the whole channel.
[7654.30s -> 7656.73s]  But thanks
[7656.73s -> 7658.73s]  Katie, that's a fucking extreme
[7658.73s -> 7662.95s]  amount of money. These
[7662.95s -> 7664.95s]  are the two, what's going to happen
[7664.95s -> 7673.08s]  here? Let's see, Ford's going to win.
[7673.08s -> 7683.96s]  Six hundred dollars.
[7683.96s -> 7687.22s]  That's a fucking ton of money.
[7687.22s -> 7689.22s]  We've seen some huge
[7689.22s -> 7691.22s]  sub and bit drops
[7691.22s -> 7693.22s]  on this channel and I can't fucking believe it every
[7693.22s -> 7697.00s]  time. Thank you guys.
[7697.00s -> 7701.54s]  Harris versus Judith.
[7701.54s -> 7703.98s]  Now who's the, Sunny
[7703.98s -> 7705.98s]  Okay, let's see. If Sunny wins this fight
[7705.98s -> 7708.34s]  then
[7708.34s -> 7710.34s]  they're going to be the championship fighter.
[7710.34s -> 7713.98s]  And they just barely did.
[7713.98s -> 7716.41s]  Alright, so it's going to come down
[7716.41s -> 7718.41s]  to, I just can't lose. Smollett
[7718.41s -> 7720.41s]  has not won a single match.
[7720.41s -> 7722.71s]  This is going to be probably fairly easy.
[7722.71s -> 7725.59s]  I don't know why though,
[7725.59s -> 7729.24s]  look at this. These stats are actually
[7729.24s -> 7733.91s]  really good except for power.
[7733.91s -> 7735.91s]  Muahaha is one of their moves that's deadly.
[7735.91s -> 7737.91s]  Why would you lose every fight?
[7737.91s -> 7739.91s]  It's just the power?
[7739.91s -> 7757.38s]  That's not good at all.
[7757.38s -> 7760.52s]  Smollett. It's just a rabbit.
[7760.52s -> 7765.26s]  See if I can one shot.
[7765.26s -> 7768.26s]  Whoa.
[7768.26s -> 7772.30s]  Okay.
[7772.30s -> 7775.37s]  Guts down
[7775.37s -> 7777.37s]  and I'll just do it back to back here.
[7777.37s -> 7780.50s]  High speed.
[7780.50s -> 7782.50s]  So it would be really easy to
[7782.50s -> 7784.50s]  only have 35% chance to win here.
[7784.50s -> 7786.94s]  Oh yeah,
[7786.94s -> 7788.94s]  you're terrible.
[7788.94s -> 7792.78s]  You're awful.
[7792.78s -> 7797.38s]  23 damage.
[7797.38s -> 7799.38s]  My defense isn't even that good.
[7799.38s -> 7803.91s]  Alright, LeFort, beat him.
[7803.91s -> 7810.74s]  Let's see.
[7810.74s -> 7813.75s]  Smollett just
[7813.75s -> 7815.75s]  destroyed Harris. That means Harris
[7815.75s -> 7819.14s]  is, I guess they both
[7819.14s -> 7821.14s]  pretty bad so it doesn't matter.
[7821.14s -> 7826.18s]  Close.
[7826.18s -> 7829.58s]  Alright, Harris. This is a guaranteed
[7829.58s -> 7831.58s]  championship if I win.
[7831.58s -> 7833.82s]  No it's not. If Sonny wins his
[7833.82s -> 7835.82s]  next match. No, I mean it pretty much is.
[7835.82s -> 7838.70s]  Let's see what we got.
[7838.70s -> 7842.02s]  Nothing really spectacular.
[7842.02s -> 7844.02s]  Welcome to Germacraft.
[7844.02s -> 7850.04s]  Why Germacraft?
[7850.04s -> 7856.87s]  I like those little Loch Ness
[7856.87s -> 7858.87s]  monsters. I want one of these.
[7858.87s -> 7861.11s]  Okay, we got
[7861.11s -> 7867.18s]  50% chance to hit here.
[7867.18s -> 7873.64s]  Uh oh.
[7873.64s -> 7882.15s]  That was embarrassing.
[7882.15s -> 7886.42s]  That was embarrassing.
[7886.42s -> 7888.42s]  Didn't even do anything.
[7888.42s -> 7893.16s]  I feel bad. Can I buy
[7893.16s -> 7895.16s]  Harris from this trainer?
[7895.16s -> 7897.16s]  I feel like I would take better care of Harris.
[7897.16s -> 7899.16s]  The winner is
[7899.16s -> 7903.77s]  the winner is Vroomer
[7903.77s -> 7911.77s]  moving on to Class D.
[7911.77s -> 7916.82s]  He's trying his best. Yeah.
[7916.82s -> 7918.82s]  Thousand gold. Prize carrot.
[7918.82s -> 7921.32s]  More fame. Vroomer is now
[7921.32s -> 7929.26s]  climbing the ranks. New monster?
[7929.26s -> 7934.63s]  You can train up to four in your
[7934.63s -> 7936.63s]  ranch. I think I might have to unlock
[7936.63s -> 7938.94s]  that though. You won the official
[7938.94s -> 7941.30s]  competition. Well, I guess
[7941.30s -> 7944.31s]  my work is done. Well you
[7944.31s -> 7947.06s]  done? What do you mean, Yuri?
[7947.06s -> 7949.30s]  Well, my father wants me to come back
[7949.30s -> 7951.30s]  and work at the store. I
[7951.30s -> 7953.30s]  decided I would quit if you won the competition.
[7953.30s -> 7958.74s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[7958.74s -> 7961.56s]  Sorry I didn't tell you before.
[7961.56s -> 7963.56s]  I wanted to beat TT before
[7963.56s -> 7965.56s]  I quit. It's been a lot of fun really.
[7965.56s -> 7968.18s]  I see. But wait, you mean I have to
[7968.18s -> 7970.18s]  take care of the ranch by myself?
[7970.18s -> 7973.83s]  Hee hee. Don't you worry, partner.
[7973.83s -> 7975.83s]  I've got my replacement lined up and she's
[7975.83s -> 7978.46s]  here. There you go.
[7978.46s -> 7981.85s]  Don't be shy. Come on out now.
[7981.85s -> 7984.22s]  Hi. Er. Hello.
[7984.22s -> 7986.22s]  Huh? Is that you, Rio?
[7986.22s -> 7988.58s]  Yup. Doesn't she
[7988.58s -> 7990.58s]  look different? I was amazed too.
[7990.58s -> 7993.78s]  What do you mean different? She has her hair in a ponytail.
[7993.78s -> 7998.63s]  Really?
[7998.63s -> 8000.63s]  I figured it would be easier to work with
[8000.63s -> 8002.63s]  this outfit. Does it look alright?
[8002.63s -> 8007.03s]  What's the difference? Of course
[8007.03s -> 8009.72s]  it looks great. So check this
[8009.72s -> 8011.72s]  out. When I told Caesar I'd be moving
[8011.72s -> 8013.72s]  on from my assistant position,
[8013.72s -> 8015.72s]  Rio said she wanted to take over.
[8015.72s -> 8018.15s]  Gosh. I was totally
[8018.15s -> 8020.46s]  surprised. Wow, really?
[8020.46s -> 8022.46s]  So it's okay then, right?
[8022.46s -> 8024.46s]  You be a good girl, Rio.
[8024.46s -> 8027.53s]  I always wanted to
[8027.53s -> 8029.53s]  raise monsters on a ranch.
[8029.53s -> 8032.15s]  When I heard about Yuri,
[8032.15s -> 8034.46s]  I thought this is my
[8034.46s -> 8037.34s]  chance. This is my chance?
[8037.34s -> 8039.34s]  Well, you said it. This is our chance.
[8039.34s -> 8042.86s]  Yup. Our chance.
[8042.86s -> 8050.41s]  What a good boy. Who's a good boy?
[8050.41s -> 8052.41s]  Who's a good boy?
[8052.41s -> 8055.99s]  Who's a good boy? Yes, you are.
[8055.99s -> 8063.14s]  Uh, let's save the
[8063.14s -> 8065.14s]  game before I have a panic
[8065.14s -> 8067.14s]  attack meltdown when it doesn't
[8067.14s -> 8069.14s]  happen and the game crashes or something.
[8079.19s -> 8081.19s]  Please end this stream forever. Why?
[8081.19s -> 8084.52s]  End it.
[8084.52s -> 8086.52s]  Okay, so how...
[8086.52s -> 8088.52s]  Let's go to the shrine. Can I...
[8088.52s -> 8090.52s]  I want to... Let's get a new monster.
[8090.52s -> 8095.90s]  Let's do it. Everything going well.
[8095.90s -> 8097.90s]  What will it be? Create.
[8097.90s -> 8099.90s]  You already have a
[8099.90s -> 8101.90s]  monster you are raising.
[8101.90s -> 8104.39s]  What will it be?
[8104.39s -> 8106.39s]  Yeah, how do... Somebody said I could...
[8106.39s -> 8108.57s]  One guy told me that
[8108.57s -> 8110.57s]  I could do four. Do I need to...
[8110.57s -> 8112.57s]  I might have to get to a certain rank?
[8112.57s -> 8118.33s]  I need to unlock the bigger ranch.
[8118.33s -> 8120.33s]  Alright, well then, rumor's going to take us to the top and then from there
[8120.33s -> 8122.33s]  we're going to get more.
[8122.33s -> 8126.62s]  This is the next, like, six to
[8126.62s -> 8128.62s]  ten weeks worth of streams, guys, so...
[8133.27s -> 8135.27s]  Alright, let me take a look at
[8135.27s -> 8138.60s]  what we need to work on here.
[8138.60s -> 8141.10s]  Power's good.
[8141.10s -> 8145.77s]  Accuracy could use some work.
[8145.77s -> 8147.77s]  Everything... Intelligence could use some work.
[8147.77s -> 8149.77s]  But I want 200
[8149.77s -> 8151.77s]  attack power. I want more accuracy. He's...
[8151.77s -> 8153.77s]  I don't like the 50% bullshit.
[8153.77s -> 8155.77s]  I don't know a lot about Minecraft VR.
[8155.77s -> 8157.77s]  Ten community...
[8157.77s -> 8164.23s]  more community subs.
[8164.23s -> 8166.92s]  Back to back they keep coming back and forth here.
[8166.92s -> 8170.94s]  Thank you.
[8170.94s -> 8173.69s]  I haven't trained any life at all either.
[8173.69s -> 8176.63s]  I know. It's true.
[8176.63s -> 8178.63s]  It's too much to think about.
[8178.63s -> 8183.11s]  Let's get a good schedule here then.
[8183.11s -> 8185.42s]  Alright, I want...
[8185.42s -> 8187.42s]  Let's do...
[8187.42s -> 8189.42s]  I'm going to do
[8189.42s -> 8191.42s]  accuracy and life.
[8191.42s -> 8193.42s]  Back and forth here.
[8196.87s -> 8198.87s]  Day of rest.
[8201.80s -> 8206.60s]  Let's see how we go from there.
[8208.60s -> 8212.57s]  Accuracy.
[8214.57s -> 8216.57s]  Not good, but not great.
[8218.57s -> 8232.44s]  I'm going to scold. I mean,
[8232.44s -> 8234.44s]  we've been very, very, very...
[8236.44s -> 8238.44s]  Focus is not that great either.
[8240.44s -> 8243.24s]  Yeah, I know.
[8243.24s -> 8246.17s]  Look, we've been very, very
[8246.17s -> 8248.17s]  nice.
[8248.17s -> 8250.17s]  We've praised every time.
[8250.17s -> 8252.17s]  Don't want the monster to get
[8252.17s -> 8254.41s]  to a point where they're, you know,
[8254.41s -> 8256.65s]  getting lazy or anything.
[8256.65s -> 8258.65s]  Hello there.
[8258.65s -> 8264.02s]  Hello Yuri. What brings you here?
[8264.02s -> 8266.58s]  Well, actually, there's somebody I want to introduce.
[8266.58s -> 8269.27s]  To you. He's right over here.
[8269.27s -> 8271.77s]  Hello.
[8271.77s -> 8274.65s]  My name is Todd. I'm a monster
[8274.65s -> 8276.65s]  venerarian.
[8276.65s -> 8278.65s]  I'm traveling around
[8278.65s -> 8280.65s]  checking the health of monsters.
[8280.65s -> 8282.65s]  Oh, nice to meet you.
[8282.65s -> 8285.98s]  Todd came all the way from the
[8285.98s -> 8288.47s]  faraway island of age.
[8288.47s -> 8290.47s]  He's traveling the world for the sake of
[8290.47s -> 8292.84s]  monsters everywhere.
[8292.84s -> 8295.40s]  All around the world, that's incredible.
[8295.40s -> 8297.40s]  Please, it's not that big of a deal.
[8297.40s -> 8299.96s]  Oops, I'm sorry. I interrupted your monster caretaking.
[8299.96s -> 8301.96s]  No, it's no problem at all.
[8301.96s -> 8304.46s]  But then I'll be heading to the other
[8304.46s -> 8307.53s]  ranches. Goodbye, bye.
[8307.53s -> 8309.53s]  If you're ever in the neighborhood, I can't help you.
[8309.53s -> 8311.90s]  If you're ever in the neighborhood, I can't
[8311.90s -> 8314.20s]  please feel free to stop by.
[8314.20s -> 8319.06s]  Okay, goodbye. What a nice person.
[8319.06s -> 8321.06s]  I can sense his love for monsters.
[8321.06s -> 8323.56s]  So there are other people in the world like
[8323.56s -> 8326.50s]  Fane, aren't there? I gotta get out of here.
[8326.50s -> 8332.58s]  I gotta go.
[8332.58s -> 8334.58s]  This ranch is just like I expected it would be.
[8334.58s -> 8336.58s]  Hello, anybody home?
[8336.58s -> 8338.58s]  Yeah, I'm the
[8338.58s -> 8341.14s]  breeder at this ranch. Who are you?
[8341.14s -> 8343.14s]  Excuse me, I'm Pollock. I'm a training
[8343.14s -> 8345.70s]  gadget peddler. Training
[8345.70s -> 8348.20s]  gadget? I saw your battle
[8348.20s -> 8350.20s]  in the competition the other day. I guess you're
[8350.20s -> 8352.20s]  not using training gadgets. I could tell.
[8352.20s -> 8354.63s]  Wait, just a minute here.
[8354.63s -> 8356.63s]  What the heck is a training gadget?
[8356.63s -> 8358.87s]  Oh, sorry. There's a fucking fifty
[8358.87s -> 8360.87s]  community subs just came in. Somebody
[8360.87s -> 8362.87s]  just blasted out like
[8362.87s -> 8365.94s]  a thousand dollars.
[8365.94s -> 8368.70s]  Hold on one minute.
[8368.70s -> 8370.70s]  KD just gave fifty community subs.
[8370.70s -> 8376.76s]  Fifty community
[8376.76s -> 8381.43s]  subs. Oh my god.
[8381.43s -> 8384.25s]  How many have you
[8384.25s -> 8386.25s]  given tonight? Let me see.
[8386.25s -> 8394.04s]  Quick math.
[8394.04s -> 8399.54s]  Holy shit, man. One guy
[8399.54s -> 8401.54s]  aims to gift all.
[8401.54s -> 8409.08s]  Thank you. For the
[8409.08s -> 8411.64s]  fucking, I don't even
[8411.64s -> 8415.86s]  that's a lot.
[8415.86s -> 8417.86s]  Vacuum is overloaded. I gotta, I have to like
[8417.86s -> 8425.35s]  empty the vacuum. Thank you
[8425.35s -> 8429.70s]  so much, man. Oh, sorry, Charlie.
[8429.70s -> 8432.26s]  I'll stop there.
[8432.26s -> 8434.26s]  Training gadgets? Oh, well
[8434.26s -> 8436.26s]  gadgets that you use for training.
[8436.26s -> 8438.57s]  In other words, they're machines that
[8438.57s -> 8440.57s]  boost effective training. Everybody
[8440.57s -> 8443.06s]  uses them. And you, my friend,
[8443.06s -> 8445.75s]  have great potential. Why don't you try
[8445.75s -> 8447.75s]  using the training gadget on your ranch?
[8447.75s -> 8449.75s]  You'll soon be seeing even better results.
[8449.75s -> 8452.18s]  Well, I'll come again later. Bye.
[8452.18s -> 8456.22s]  Hmm. Using machines
[8456.22s -> 8458.22s]  for training. What do you think, Rio?
[8458.22s -> 8464.73s]  I'm gonna change
[8464.73s -> 8468.06s]  it to this. Training gadgets
[8468.06s -> 8470.81s]  run off Geonite.
[8470.81s -> 8472.81s]  Geonite is an energy of the earth found in
[8472.81s -> 8474.81s]  spirit trees. Eddie?
[8474.81s -> 8476.81s]  It's found in spirit trees, Eddie.
[8476.81s -> 8480.33s]  So you mean gadgets
[8480.33s -> 8482.33s]  use energy from
[8482.33s -> 8487.13s]  Makroji, Eddie?
[8487.13s -> 8489.13s]  Don't worry, I'm old enough to have saved a plenty
[8489.13s -> 8491.13s]  of extra Geonite.
[8491.13s -> 8494.71s]  Makroji, don't over-exert yourself.
[8494.71s -> 8497.66s]  It's decided then.
[8497.66s -> 8499.66s]  Let's try using training gadgets
[8499.66s -> 8504.01s]  on our ranch.
[8504.01s -> 8506.01s]  Quick refund to all the gift subs.
[8506.01s -> 8508.01s]  Well,
[8508.01s -> 8510.01s]  hello. Wrong guy.
[8510.01s -> 8512.38s]  Well, hello.
[8512.38s -> 8514.38s]  They're doing well? Have you decided?
[8514.38s -> 8516.38s]  I can't, there's only so many anime fucking
[8516.38s -> 8518.38s]  dub voices I know. I don't know any others.
[8518.38s -> 8520.38s]  I know like four.
[8520.38s -> 8523.32s]  Have you decided to try using
[8523.32s -> 8525.32s]  training gadgets? I feel like I'm
[8525.32s -> 8527.32s]  stuck in a time portal.
[8527.32s -> 8530.26s]  Just give it to me.
[8530.26s -> 8532.26s]  You really ought to give them a try. Feel free to take a look at them.
[8532.26s -> 8537.13s]  What will you do?
[8537.13s -> 8539.56s]  I don't know what these are.
[8539.56s -> 8543.14s]  Pinman just gave ten community subs.
[8543.14s -> 8545.14s]  Thank you Pinman for ten community subs.
[8545.14s -> 8547.32s]  By training
[8547.32s -> 8550.01s]  effect?
[8550.01s -> 8552.63s]  You don't have any appraised training gadgets.
[8552.63s -> 8556.54s]  But thank you so much Pinman.
[8556.54s -> 8558.54s]  What will you do? By training.
[8558.54s -> 8561.29s]  What will you buy?
[8561.29s -> 8564.42s]  Oh, look at this.
[8564.42s -> 8567.18s]  Look at this.
[8567.18s -> 8569.61s]  Two thousand gold. Strength training.
[8569.61s -> 8571.61s]  Get level two. Space one by two.
[8571.61s -> 8574.23s]  Ooh.
[8574.23s -> 8576.86s]  Alright, alright.
[8576.86s -> 8579.03s]  Okay.
[8579.03s -> 8581.03s]  I'm thinking, uh, how much
[8581.03s -> 8583.40s]  do they cost?
[8583.40s -> 8585.40s]  They're like two thousand each. I got thirteen thousand?
[8585.40s -> 8592.12s]  Dude, Ruby the dog.
[8592.12s -> 8594.49s]  I'll try to do Ruby the dog.
[8594.49s -> 8596.49s]  No.
[8596.49s -> 8598.49s]  No Ruby.
[8598.49s -> 8600.49s]  It's me, Ruby.
[8600.49s -> 8602.49s]  Got it.
[8602.49s -> 8606.01s]  I'm gonna go, I want
[8606.01s -> 8608.01s]  this one.
[8608.01s -> 8613.50s]  Buy this. Yes.
[8613.50s -> 8615.50s]  Thank you very much.
[8615.50s -> 8617.50s]  Customize immediately. Uh, sure.
[8617.50s -> 8619.86s]  Oh, I have to place it.
[8619.86s -> 8624.47s]  Wait, what?
[8624.47s -> 8626.78s]  Poor house,
[8626.78s -> 8628.78s]  poor hut.
[8628.78s -> 8632.30s]  Oh, my God.
[8632.30s -> 8636.63s]  This is huge.
[8636.63s -> 8638.63s]  Um.
[8638.63s -> 8641.77s]  Poor streamer.
[8641.77s -> 8644.07s]  Not tonight.
[8644.07s -> 8649.51s]  Alright, then.
[8649.51s -> 8651.51s]  Alright, we're gonna use that.
[8651.51s -> 8657.90s]  Anything else to buy?
[8657.90s -> 8659.90s]  Um, yeah.
[8659.90s -> 8662.39s]  You guys are out of your minds.
[8662.39s -> 8664.39s]  Studley Do-Right gave twenty
[8664.39s -> 8671.18s]  community subs.
[8671.18s -> 8673.18s]  Holy shit, guys.
[8673.18s -> 8677.02s]  I'm spoiled rotten.
[8677.02s -> 8683.10s]  Uh, what about speed trampoline?
[8683.10s -> 8685.53s]  Is one by one?
[8685.53s -> 8688.28s]  I can do that, right?
[8688.28s -> 8690.28s]  No, it's not. I can't. Can I?
[8690.28s -> 8694.44s]  But thank you so much.
[8694.44s -> 8698.66s]  I'm buying the speed one.
[8698.66s -> 8703.14s]  I think I can fit this.
[8703.14s -> 8705.14s]  It's one by one, right?
[8707.14s -> 8709.14s]  Yeah. Trampoline?
[8709.14s -> 8711.14s]  Any more one by ones?
[8711.14s -> 8719.51s]  This is one by two.
[8719.51s -> 8722.39s]  One by two.
[8722.39s -> 8724.39s]  Two by three. One by one.
[8724.39s -> 8726.39s]  One by two. No.
[8726.39s -> 8729.72s]  Alright, what else you got?
[8729.72s -> 8731.72s]  Sell?
[8731.72s -> 8734.54s]  What will you sell? Can I sell my house?
[8734.54s -> 8737.54s]  Uh, Adventure MFDan
[8737.54s -> 8739.54s]  five more subs.
[8739.54s -> 8742.42s]  Five more subs.
[8742.42s -> 8744.42s]  From MFDan.
[8744.42s -> 8750.06s]  Money laundering stream.
[8752.42s -> 8755.11s]  Holy shit.
[8755.11s -> 8758.74s]  Alright, so now.
[8760.74s -> 8762.92s]  Let's see. That was speed and
[8762.92s -> 8764.92s]  accuracy.
[8764.92s -> 8767.42s]  Let's go to the schedule.
[8767.42s -> 8769.42s]  This is speed and accuracy, right?
[8772.04s -> 8774.47s]  Yeah. Shadow box is accuracy
[8774.47s -> 8776.47s]  and balance is speed.
[8776.47s -> 8778.47s]  I believe.
[8778.47s -> 8780.47s]  No. Oh, look at this!
[8785.86s -> 8788.36s]  Target.
[8788.36s -> 8791.18s]  Very cool.
[8793.18s -> 8795.42s]  Target and then
[8797.78s -> 8799.78s]  Trampoline.
[8799.78s -> 8801.78s]  Target, trampoline, rest, trampoline.
[8801.78s -> 8804.41s]  Got it.
[8804.41s -> 8806.41s]  I'm excited for this one.
[8806.41s -> 8808.41s]  We actually get to see them do a different animation.
[8808.41s -> 8819.14s]  Nice.
[8819.14s -> 8821.14s]  So you have to build up your ranch and they can
[8821.14s -> 8823.14s]  use... This is cool.
[8823.14s -> 8828.26s]  Nice work. Alright, you're very tired though
[8828.26s -> 8832.55s]  and very hungry.
[8832.55s -> 8834.55s]  Uh, food. Let's give you some...
[8834.55s -> 8841.51s]  Let's give you a mango.
[8841.51s -> 8844.52s]  I love mangoes.
[8844.52s -> 8847.34s]  Frustrated? Well, you'll be fine.
[8847.34s -> 8855.40s]  Vroomer is cute. Vroomer seems to be
[8855.40s -> 8857.40s]  a little worried about something.
[8857.40s -> 8860.09s]  Hmm, I wonder what's wrong. Oh,
[8860.09s -> 8862.26s]  Caesar!
[8887.06s -> 8889.06s]  In the hut, things might get exciting around here.
[8889.06s -> 8892.33s]  It should be fun.
[8892.33s -> 8894.33s]  But with more monsters,
[8894.33s -> 8896.33s]  you may have to expand the ranch itself.
[8896.33s -> 8898.33s]  How about this? I'll ask a carpenter
[8898.33s -> 8900.33s]  friend of mine. He should be able
[8900.33s -> 8902.33s]  to get working on something right away.
[8902.33s -> 8905.27s]  Carpenter?
[8905.27s -> 8907.45s]  But we don't...
[8907.45s -> 8909.69s]  We don't have any money.
[8909.69s -> 8911.69s]  Oh boy, could you stop acting like a stranger?
[8911.69s -> 8914.06s]  I know this will put a smile
[8914.06s -> 8916.06s]  on your face and to me that's worth more
[8916.06s -> 8919.26s]  than anything in the world.
[8919.26s -> 8921.88s]  Father, thank you.
[8921.88s -> 8923.88s]  Well, then it's settled. Leave the rest to me.
[8923.88s -> 8933.53s]  Ciao.
[8933.53s -> 8937.24s]  That's good.
[8937.24s -> 8939.86s]  So now we get to make more monsters.
[8939.86s -> 8948.06s]  Dude, what an
[8948.06s -> 8951.38s]  epic November fail.
[8951.38s -> 8953.38s]  Hello there, partner. Is Fane home?
[8953.38s -> 8955.69s]  Fane, it's me. But who are you?
[8955.69s -> 8958.25s]  Me? I don't know the name to you.
[8958.25s -> 8961.00s]  I'm the carpenter that Caesar hired.
[8961.00s -> 8963.00s]  You're the carpenter?
[8963.00s -> 8965.56s]  You betcha I am.
[8965.56s -> 8967.56s]  No, don't you worry about a thing. Leave it all to
[8967.56s -> 8969.56s]  you. To leave it to me?
[8969.56s -> 8971.86s]  No, you.
[8971.86s -> 8973.86s]  What?
[8973.86s -> 8975.86s]  Okay, we's got us a ranch, a hut
[8975.86s -> 8979.45s]  and a rickety house.
[8979.45s -> 8981.45s]  Okay, we'll have you a brand new ranch in one week.
[8981.45s -> 8991.54s]  What? Er, thanks.
[8991.54s -> 8994.17s]  In one week we have a new ranch.
[8994.17s -> 8996.17s]  Oh, I'm so fucking
[8996.17s -> 8998.17s]  excited now. Alright.
[8998.17s -> 9000.47s]  Frustrated.
[9000.47s -> 9002.47s]  Maybe you should jump on a trampoline.
[9002.47s -> 9008.30s]  Plus 10
[9008.30s -> 9010.30s]  every time you do that. 60% success rate.
[9010.30s -> 9013.56s]  Alright, what's your favorite food?
[9013.56s -> 9016.57s]  You don't have to do that with
[9016.57s -> 9018.57s]  the tire. You can do it
[9018.57s -> 9021.38s]  somewhere else. Alright,
[9021.38s -> 9023.88s]  let's give you...
[9023.88s -> 9026.44s]  What do I have? I have no items to give.
[9026.44s -> 9029.56s]  You're doing a great job.
[9029.56s -> 9033.72s]  Does the wheel feel pain?
[9033.72s -> 9036.02s]  I don't know.
[9036.02s -> 9038.02s]  I mean, the wheel is part of him.
[9038.02s -> 9042.25s]  Alright, good job,
[9042.25s -> 9044.25s]  Brumer. Take the week off.
[9049.56s -> 9059.66s]  Alrighty, boys, that'll do it.
[9059.66s -> 9061.66s]  Well, what do you think?
[9061.66s -> 9063.66s]  Gives you a lot of space, huh?
[9063.66s -> 9065.83s]  Wow, you, you're just
[9065.83s -> 9067.83s]  my age. But you direct all those
[9067.83s -> 9069.83s]  adults around like a true leader.
[9069.83s -> 9072.26s]  Yeah, so cool.
[9072.26s -> 9074.82s]  Oh, give me a break. I'm just doing
[9074.82s -> 9077.26s]  my job. Now three
[9077.26s -> 9079.26s]  monsters can live in the hut and you can
[9079.26s -> 9081.26s]  store more gadgets in the house.
[9081.26s -> 9083.56s]  So where would you like to
[9083.56s -> 9085.56s]  put the house and hut? I'll place it wherever you like.
[9087.74s -> 9089.74s]  Look at this real estate.
[9089.74s -> 9091.74s]  Just fucking so big.
[9091.74s -> 9093.74s]  Alright, this is what we need.
[9093.74s -> 9095.74s]  Normal house.
[9097.91s -> 9099.91s]  Up here.
[9099.91s -> 9101.91s]  And then a normal hut.
[9104.09s -> 9106.09s]  You can spin it around too.
[9108.09s -> 9110.26s]  Um...
[9112.26s -> 9114.26s]  I like it right here.
[9116.89s -> 9119.90s]  Okay, that means I got some more room
[9119.90s -> 9122.33s]  here. Yeah, I don't want the
[9122.33s -> 9124.33s]  house right next to the barn, you know what I mean? It'll smell.
[9124.33s -> 9130.47s]  You can range friends
[9130.47s -> 9132.47s]  for Brumer. No problem at all,
[9132.47s -> 9134.47s]  buddy. If you outgrow this hut, give me a
[9134.47s -> 9137.03s]  haul at any time. The next time I
[9137.03s -> 9139.03s]  charge the regular fucking raid dude.
[9139.03s -> 9143.64s]  See you later.
[9143.64s -> 9145.94s]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[9145.94s -> 9147.94s]  I'm being completely honest here. Alright, let's go.
[9147.94s -> 9150.25s]  So, let's go get some friends.
[9150.25s -> 9157.74s]  What's the next disk that's going in?
[9157.74s -> 9162.60s]  Well, hello, everything going well.
[9162.60s -> 9164.60s]  What will it be?
[9164.60s -> 9166.60s]  Which method would you use?
[9166.60s -> 9168.60s]  I'm going to use a saucer.
[9168.60s -> 9171.16s]  Generate a monster from a saucer.
[9173.16s -> 9176.02s]  Even more.
[9176.02s -> 9178.02s]  Even more community subs.
[9178.02s -> 9184.47s]  Alright, so I'm thinking
[9184.47s -> 9186.47s]  either Floydgan Brothers or Seventh Cross
[9186.47s -> 9188.47s]  Evolution. Cause Seventh Cross
[9188.47s -> 9191.29s]  Evolution was a game
[9191.29s -> 9193.29s]  about evolving monsters.
[9193.29s -> 9197.77s]  Wait, Floydgan? You want me to get Floydgan in there?
[9197.77s -> 9199.77s]  Alright, okay. Alright, alright.
[9199.77s -> 9202.20s]  I'll do it. Here it is.
[9202.20s -> 9207.18s]  Why is this hot?
[9207.18s -> 9209.18s]  This disk is hot. It wasn't even, I don't know why.
[9209.18s -> 9211.54s]  The window? Maybe, yeah. The sun is like
[9211.54s -> 9213.54s]  shining on it. It's going to like melt this thing.
[9213.54s -> 9216.30s]  Alright, here you go. I always have to
[9216.30s -> 9218.30s]  prove that it's actually happening, so.
[9218.30s -> 9221.05s]  Here. Let me look at my
[9221.05s -> 9225.14s]  hair too. People were talking about my hair.
[9225.14s -> 9227.14s]  Yeah, it is a little fucking weird, isn't it?
[9227.14s -> 9232.44s]  Here you go. Floydgan.
[9232.44s -> 9240.62s]  For the Dreamcast. Power Stone.
[9240.62s -> 9242.62s]  I'll do Power Stone. Just not right this second.
[9242.62s -> 9247.86s]  Your hair looks very nice.
[9247.86s -> 9252.22s]  Floydgan Brothers going in.
[9252.22s -> 9258.34s]  Give us something good.
[9258.34s -> 9266.15s]  Give us like a team, a duo.
[9266.15s -> 9268.15s]  What if you put in the other Monster Rancher disk?
[9268.15s -> 9270.15s]  They all kind of have something crazy come out, don't they?
[9270.15s -> 9275.21s]  We had more community subs
[9275.21s -> 9279.56s]  from Lunch Meat.
[9279.56s -> 9281.56s]  How many hundreds of community subs?
[9281.56s -> 9285.59s]  The ending credits are going to be crazy tonight.
[9285.59s -> 9292.44s]  Thank you guys. Alright, here comes Floydgan Brothers.
[9292.44s -> 9295.13s]  See what we get. I hope
[9295.13s -> 9310.87s]  it's a monster with two heads.
[9310.87s -> 9313.05s]  I hope it looks like me.
[9313.05s -> 9315.05s]  The count is three hundred and forty.
[9315.05s -> 9319.72s]  Three hundred and forty community subs.
[9319.72s -> 9325.54s]  Thanks for waiting. Time to create
[9325.54s -> 9329.45s]  a monster. Alright, does it get
[9329.45s -> 9331.45s]  put in the trash or does it come to the ranch?
[9347.96s -> 9350.90s]  This is a Cheeto
[9350.90s -> 9359.29s]  flavored vroomer. I see
[9359.29s -> 9361.29s]  it's the first time Fane has raised this
[9361.29s -> 9363.29s]  monster. Let me add a page to your book.
[9363.29s -> 9366.36s]  Take this monster. Alright, am I
[9366.36s -> 9368.36s]  putting like the Cheeto
[9368.36s -> 9370.36s]  vroomer? Am I throwing the Cheeto vroomer away?
[9370.36s -> 9376.57s]  I'm not having two
[9376.57s -> 9386.94s]  vroomers.
[9386.94s -> 9388.94s]  Destroy. They're brothers.
[9388.94s -> 9392.20s]  It's the Floydgan Brothers.
[9392.20s -> 9394.20s]  Trash. Trash. Trash. Trash. Garbage.
[9394.20s -> 9396.20s]  Garbage. I need a pole. I'm seeing too much
[9396.20s -> 9401.90s]  of this. It's just
[9401.90s -> 9403.90s]  vroomer without any skin.
[9403.90s -> 9406.07s]  I don't want
[9406.07s -> 9419.30s]  whatever. Alright.
[9419.30s -> 9421.80s]  Trash or no. Trash it.
[9421.80s -> 9430.82s]  Keep it. There you go.
[9430.82s -> 9438.74s]  New pole.
[9438.74s -> 9443.93s]  Wow, this is
[9443.93s -> 9445.93s]  80 percent.
[9445.93s -> 9448.68s]  Oh, nobody
[9448.68s -> 9450.68s]  wants this.
[9450.68s -> 9452.92s]  That's unbelievable. This might be the most skewed
[9452.92s -> 9454.92s]  pole I think I've ever done in here.
[9454.92s -> 9465.46s]  80 percent. I don't think I could
[9465.46s -> 9470.01s]  even let this go on. Yeah, that's
[9470.01s -> 9472.01s]  it. Take this monster home. No.
[9472.01s -> 9478.14s]  I'm sorry.
[9478.14s -> 9481.21s]  Try a different saucer stone.
[9481.21s -> 9483.21s]  Sorry Floydgan.
[9483.21s -> 9488.46s]  The one up next is, we're going to put in
[9488.46s -> 9492.04s]  Tony Hawk 2.
[9492.04s -> 9498.44s]  See what we get with Tony Hawk. So you see
[9498.44s -> 9500.44s]  let me show it off. Let me show off
[9500.44s -> 9503.45s]  the disc. Tony Hawk's
[9503.45s -> 9505.45s]  Pro Skater 2. There it is.
[9505.45s -> 9507.45s]  In all of its glory. Original Dreamcast
[9507.45s -> 9509.45s]  video game.
[9509.45s -> 9515.90s]  Third vroomer.
[9515.90s -> 9527.53s]  We'll see. Here we go. Somebody on
[9527.53s -> 9532.01s]  a skateboard.
[9532.01s -> 9535.83s]  Oh my goodness.
[9535.83s -> 9537.83s]  Did you buy CDs just for the game?
[9537.83s -> 9542.31s]  No, I have all original hardware.
[9542.31s -> 9544.31s]  One of my taglines as a streamer
[9544.31s -> 9546.31s]  is like, German95
[9546.31s -> 9548.31s]  what's that channel like?
[9548.31s -> 9552.60s]  He's an original hardware streamer.
[9552.60s -> 9554.60s]  It's a game for myself.
[9554.60s -> 9556.60s]  Real Dreamcast. Real PlayStation 1.
[9556.60s -> 9561.08s]  Real hardware.
[9561.08s -> 9563.77s]  I actually got Tony Hawk over here
[9563.77s -> 9565.77s]  to like skateboard in front of me.
[9565.77s -> 9579.66s]  Real hardware only. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2
[9579.66s -> 9581.66s]  for the Dreamcast. Let's see what happens.
[9581.66s -> 9583.66s]  A lot of Dreamcast games, yeah. We just did a bunch of them.
[9583.66s -> 9589.99s]  Thanks for waiting. Time to create.
[9589.99s -> 9602.66s]  I have like the
[9602.66s -> 9604.66s]  Karilla's latest album here too.
[9608.38s -> 9614.50s]  Uh, what a cute
[9614.50s -> 9617.32s]  monster. I see it's the first
[9617.32s -> 9619.32s]  time Vayne has raised this monster.
[9619.32s -> 9622.84s]  Let me add a page to your book.
[9622.84s -> 9624.84s]  Uh, are we taking the little mushroom home?
[9624.84s -> 9632.65s]  It's
[9632.65s -> 9634.65s]  Vinesauce.
[9642.82s -> 9645.45s]  Alright, we'll keep it.
[9645.45s -> 9647.75s]  We'll keep it.
[9647.75s -> 9656.65s]  It looks like a magician. I'm gonna keep it.
[9656.65s -> 9658.95s]  You're naming this monster.
[9658.95s -> 9666.76s]  Name it Vinny.
[9668.76s -> 9674.18s]  I don't know
[9674.18s -> 9676.18s]  if I want to name it Vinny because eventually if I
[9676.18s -> 9678.18s]  freeze it and kill it, that's not
[9678.18s -> 9680.18s]  I don't know if I'm gonna like that.
[9680.18s -> 9689.08s]  Alright, what if we do
[9689.08s -> 9691.08s]  a, a, okay, how about
[9693.64s -> 9700.55s]  how about
[9700.55s -> 9702.55s]  hashtag V?
[9702.55s -> 9706.26s]  Shroom
[9706.26s -> 9710.23s]  hashtag V
[9710.23s -> 9712.23s]  is so bad.
[9712.23s -> 9714.86s]  Let's just go with Shroomer.
[9714.86s -> 9716.86s]  Because that's pretty good. Hashtag V is the worst
[9716.86s -> 9719.03s]  name I've ever made up.
[9719.03s -> 9732.46s]  Shroomer.
[9732.46s -> 9734.76s]  Look after it. Try a different saucer
[9734.76s -> 9736.94s]  stone. Uh, yeah.
[9736.94s -> 9738.94s]  So I have two more, right? Or one more.
[9738.94s -> 9744.17s]  Alright,
[9744.17s -> 9746.17s]  this next one cannot end in an oomer.
[9746.17s -> 9750.52s]  Alright, what am I gonna do here? Alright, here's what I'm gonna put in.
[9750.52s -> 9753.08s]  I'm gonna put in
[9753.08s -> 9758.07s]  I'm gonna put in this.
[9758.07s -> 9761.27s]  This game is called
[9761.27s -> 9765.18s]  for the PC
[9765.18s -> 9767.18s]  or I don't know, I couldn't get it. Yeah,
[9767.18s -> 9769.18s]  Windows 95. I couldn't get this to fucking work
[9769.18s -> 9772.12s]  no matter what I did. This is
[9772.12s -> 9774.74s]  Jurassic Park Scan
[9774.74s -> 9779.10s]  Command. It's got a, you know, T-Rex
[9779.10s -> 9781.40s]  on it and everything.
[9781.40s -> 9783.40s]  This, I was gonna do a whole stream on this.
[9783.40s -> 9785.70s]  You have like a barcode scanner
[9785.70s -> 9789.61s]  and you scan it, but
[9789.61s -> 9792.55s]  there's a, didn't, I couldn't,
[9792.55s -> 9794.98s]  you know, just didn't work.
[9794.98s -> 9798.87s]  Scan Command.
[9798.87s -> 9801.11s]  Let's see what we get for Scan Command
[9801.11s -> 9806.17s]  for Jurassic Park. Why is your hair doing that?
[9806.17s -> 9808.54s]  I don't know.
[9808.54s -> 9811.03s]  I have a naturally fucked up head. I'm serious.
[9811.03s -> 9813.03s]  If I shave my head and you like put your hand
[9813.03s -> 9815.03s]  over it, it's like a little bumpy and like rocky
[9815.03s -> 9831.99s]  and shit. Opening the tray.
[9831.99s -> 9836.98s]  Let's see what Jurassic Park Scan
[9836.98s -> 9840.06s]  Command has in store.
[9840.06s -> 9845.30s]  Oh no, that was, that's Tony Hawk.
[9845.30s -> 9847.61s]  I wish I'd put Tony Hawk back in.
[9847.61s -> 9857.32s]  Alright, bring it on.
[9857.32s -> 9861.61s]  Five more community subs from GermanLight
[9861.61s -> 9865.32s]  about Minecraft VR. Five more.
[9865.32s -> 9867.32s]  Five, five, five, five, five. Coming in
[9867.32s -> 9869.32s]  every, every five minutes
[9869.32s -> 9871.32s]  with five community subs or ten community subs.
[9871.32s -> 9875.10s]  So many. Thank you.
[9875.10s -> 9890.76s]  I hope it's a dinosaur. Alright,
[9890.76s -> 9893.19s]  no rumor.
[9893.19s -> 9897.34s]  Okay, I kind of like it.
[9897.34s -> 9905.21s]  It looks like,
[9905.21s -> 9908.54s]  it looks like something that you could eat
[9908.54s -> 9910.54s]  on the set of Willy Wonka.
[9910.54s -> 9914.55s]  I'm keeping it. No, I'm not.
[9914.55s -> 9918.26s]  Ugh.
[9918.26s -> 9922.62s]  I only have three slots.
[9922.62s -> 9926.07s]  Too many mushrooms.
[9926.07s -> 9928.76s]  Too many mushrooms.
[9928.76s -> 9931.58s]  Trash it.
[9931.58s -> 9935.16s]  Too many, I'm not, no too much. We got two
[9935.16s -> 9946.55s]  mushrooms in a wheel. No.
[9946.55s -> 9948.55s]  Alright, the next thing going in, let me ask you,
[9948.55s -> 9950.55s]  okay, I don't know why I have this.
[9950.55s -> 9954.33s]  I don't even know if I did this before.
[9954.33s -> 9956.33s]  Um, some people are going to know what
[9956.33s -> 9960.62s]  this is. This is from
[9960.62s -> 9962.62s]  MTV Liquid Television.
[9962.62s -> 9966.58s]  This is a DVD
[9966.58s -> 9969.40s]  set of the show
[9969.40s -> 9976.23s]  The Head. Does anybody remember
[9976.23s -> 9979.24s]  this show? It was the Liquid Television
[9979.24s -> 9987.18s]  MTV Audities.
[9987.18s -> 9991.27s]  I got all of them. I have the whole show.
[9991.27s -> 9993.83s]  I, I don't know like why I have this.
[9993.83s -> 9996.26s]  I think I bought this at like a
[9996.26s -> 9999.40s]  convention or something. And I was like,
[9999.40s -> 10001.40s]  oh, MTV, the Liquid Audities.
[10001.40s -> 10003.40s]  I haven't even opened this. I like took
[10003.40s -> 10005.40s]  the skin off of it for some reason.
[10005.40s -> 10009.30s]  Why, and I don't know why I brought this across
[10009.30s -> 10012.06s]  the country. I donated
[10012.06s -> 10014.06s]  a ton of my old games
[10014.06s -> 10016.06s]  and I gave a bunch of my old stuff away, but
[10016.06s -> 10018.87s]  The Head came with me
[10018.87s -> 10023.86s]  for some reason. I haven't even
[10023.86s -> 10026.55s]  watched it. For some reason I thought it was going to be
[10026.55s -> 10030.26s]  worth money. It was dumb.
[10030.26s -> 10038.58s]  I don't know. My parents didn't let me
[10038.58s -> 10046.33s]  watch MTV. MTV
[10046.33s -> 10051.45s]  was pretty fucked up back then.
[10051.45s -> 10053.45s]  The cartoons on MTV were
[10053.45s -> 10055.45s]  like Nickelodeon 4.0
[10055.45s -> 10059.16s]  with like the grossness. Puke, like
[10059.16s -> 10061.16s]  farts, throw up, acid.
[10061.16s -> 10063.16s]  You know what I mean? Like there was all kinds of weird shit
[10063.16s -> 10065.16s]  on MTV back like in the 90s.
[10065.16s -> 10071.50s]  Nickelodeon had like farts and
[10071.50s -> 10073.50s]  puke and throw up and stuff, but
[10073.50s -> 10075.67s]  not like that, like the
[10075.67s -> 10077.67s]  Beavis and Butthead era on MTV.
[10077.67s -> 10098.65s]  Alright. Wait, did I put the
[10098.65s -> 10101.08s]  I didn't put the same disc in, right?
[10101.08s -> 10103.08s]  Why? I swear
[10103.08s -> 10105.08s]  to God. No,
[10105.08s -> 10108.86s]  I put this in.
[10108.86s -> 10114.47s]  It's the same monster.
[10114.47s -> 10117.29s]  Did it glitch out and save it?
[10117.29s -> 10119.29s]  Alright, we're doing the Head disc 2.
[10119.29s -> 10121.29s]  How do these have the same seed?
[10121.29s -> 10125.26s]  Disc 2 of the Head is
[10125.26s -> 10131.02s]  I'm not accepting that.
[10140.60s -> 10142.60s]  Didn't bring his PS4, but brought
[10142.60s -> 10152.46s]  the Head. Alright, but a
[10152.46s -> 10154.46s]  PS4 is big and bulky and has to go
[10154.46s -> 10156.46s]  in a box and shit. The Head is just a
[10156.46s -> 10166.57s]  DVD case. Alright.
[10166.57s -> 10169.38s]  Insert the Monster Rancher 4 disc.
[10169.38s -> 10176.17s]  This is the Head disc 2.
[10176.17s -> 10178.17s]  What about your Bloodborne save?
[10178.17s -> 10192.76s]  It's okay. Alright, give me something
[10192.76s -> 10199.93s]  else that's not a shroom.
[10199.93s -> 10201.93s]  He threw away his PS4? Oh no, I gave it
[10201.93s -> 10203.93s]  away. I gave my PS4.
[10203.93s -> 10224.89s]  Alright.
[10224.89s -> 10229.56s]  That was the
[10229.56s -> 10231.56s]  Head disc 1 disc 2 and
[10231.56s -> 10234.31s]  what was the one before it?
[10234.31s -> 10238.52s]  Scan command?
[10257.86s -> 10265.86s]  No, I'm not going to name it another
[10265.86s -> 10276.68s]  Umer. I told you. I told you
[10276.68s -> 10278.68s]  that's the thing on like you could eat in Willy Wonka.
[10278.68s -> 10280.68s]  I'm not naming him Tumer.
[10280.68s -> 10283.43s]  Or Umer. Or like
[10283.43s -> 10287.00s]  Doomer.
[10287.00s -> 10293.34s]  No, we have Boomer, Shroomer,
[10293.34s -> 10298.71s]  and Wonka. Let me see the
[10298.71s -> 10302.42s]  stats. How do I get a different
[10302.42s -> 10305.05s]  another go? Okay, there's Shroomer,
[10305.05s -> 10307.05s]  Vroomer, and
[10307.05s -> 10309.35s]  Wonka.
[10309.35s -> 10311.35s]  This company doesn't even exist anymore.
[10311.35s -> 10313.72s]  They liquidated it. Look at that.
[10313.72s -> 10315.72s]  That's pretty awesome actually. Alright.
[10315.72s -> 10317.72s]  Shroomer.
[10317.72s -> 10319.72s]  High defense. Look at that.
[10319.72s -> 10329.06s]  He's doing the Peepo dance.
[10329.06s -> 10333.03s]  Wonka sucks.
[10333.03s -> 10335.91s]  Not really. That's a lot. That's really high health.
[10335.91s -> 10338.09s]  And the base intelligence
[10338.09s -> 10340.78s]  is really good.
[10340.78s -> 10343.59s]  What does he do?
[10343.59s -> 10346.60s]  Alright, we've got
[10346.60s -> 10349.35s]  pecking.
[10349.35s -> 10352.49s]  Slap. Accuracy
[10352.49s -> 10354.49s]  rate is pretty
[10354.49s -> 10356.49s]  high. This is the one right here. Pollen. This is a
[10356.49s -> 10359.30s]  poison. So unfortunately,
[10359.30s -> 10361.30s]  this is a dot. It's the only move
[10361.30s -> 10363.30s]  that doesn't do damage.
[10363.30s -> 10366.25s]  And even so,
[10366.25s -> 10368.25s]  it doesn't do very much damage. It's
[10368.25s -> 10370.25s]  D for damage. This is A for accuracy.
[10370.25s -> 10372.25s]  Yeah, he's terrible.
[10372.25s -> 10377.62s]  Ice him. Shroomer is
[10377.62s -> 10386.14s]  alright. High defense.
[10386.14s -> 10388.63s]  High base defense. Let's see what you
[10388.63s -> 10390.63s]  get from moves. Let's see if he's, you know,
[10390.63s -> 10393.45s]  So it's all about intelligence.
[10393.45s -> 10395.45s]  And power a little bit.
[10395.45s -> 10397.45s]  Let's see. This is
[10397.45s -> 10399.45s]  Pokorin.
[10399.45s -> 10401.45s]  It's a short range move. And then
[10401.45s -> 10403.62s]  aim hit.
[10403.62s -> 10407.53s]  Accuracy is an A.
[10407.53s -> 10409.53s]  Life damage is an E.
[10409.53s -> 10411.77s]  D.
[10414.12s -> 10417.13s]  He's kind of terrible.
[10417.13s -> 10419.13s]  The accuracy is alright.
[10419.13s -> 10421.37s]  But look at that life to E for life
[10421.37s -> 10425.02s]  damage.
[10425.02s -> 10428.22s]  We'll work on Shroomer. I feel like Shroomer will be
[10428.22s -> 10431.03s]  okay later.
[10431.03s -> 10433.40s]  He has lightning element
[10433.40s -> 10435.40s]  statuses.
[10435.40s -> 10437.40s]  Soft body.
[10437.40s -> 10439.40s]  Softens damage from punch or
[10439.40s -> 10442.73s]  stab attacks.
[10442.73s -> 10444.73s]  And is spoiled rotten already.
[10444.73s -> 10447.10s]  Doesn't like to fight.
[10447.10s -> 10450.17s]  Is already spoiled.
[10450.17s -> 10453.75s]  Doesn't like to fight.
[10453.75s -> 10455.75s]  You are really on thin ice and I really mean
[10455.75s -> 10457.75s]  that literally because you're going to get fucking
[10457.75s -> 10464.60s]  frozen in about 10 seconds.
[10464.60s -> 10466.60s]  I hate this thing.
[10472.66s -> 10474.66s]  I think it might be, I think we're going to freeze.
[10474.66s -> 10476.66s]  Both.
[10476.66s -> 10482.36s]  Alright.
[10482.36s -> 10484.66s]  How do I, what does it do?
[10484.66s -> 10486.66s]  It's not a praise. No. How do I do it?
[10486.66s -> 10495.10s]  Association.
[10495.10s -> 10497.10s]  Fuse him. I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him.
[10497.10s -> 10499.10s]  I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him.
[10505.05s -> 10507.05s]  Wonka and Shroomer are going to get fused.
[10507.05s -> 10512.34s]  Don't you need a certain item?
[10512.34s -> 10514.90s]  Alright. Retire.
[10514.90s -> 10519.19s]  Or can I combine them right now?
[10519.19s -> 10521.19s]  They have to be frozen.
[10521.19s -> 10523.19s]  Look at Mao's power.
[10523.19s -> 10525.19s]  100 base power? Why did we throw that one in the trash?
[10525.19s -> 10530.18s]  Alright. Retire.
[10530.18s -> 10535.69s]  Shroomer.
[10535.69s -> 10539.34s]  Freeze Shroomer.
[10539.34s -> 10541.70s]  Sorry, but that's the end of you.
[10546.23s -> 10549.82s]  Retire.
[10549.82s -> 10553.91s]  Wonka.
[10553.91s -> 10555.91s]  This feels unfair because Rumer's stats are terrible
[10555.91s -> 10557.91s]  in comparison to all, whatever.
[10557.91s -> 10571.53s]  Now.
[10571.53s -> 10576.20s]  Combine. Let's combine.
[10576.20s -> 10578.20s]  We got Shroomer.
[10578.20s -> 10582.54s]  Combine.
[10582.54s -> 10584.54s]  Shroomer and...
[10584.54s -> 10586.54s]  What is...
[10586.54s -> 10588.97s]  Is that what they were
[10588.97s -> 10590.97s]  combined with in the first place?
[10590.97s -> 10592.97s]  Shroomer and Wonka.
[10592.97s -> 10595.27s]  Mao's and Shroomer.
[10595.27s -> 10598.47s]  We're going to get
[10598.47s -> 10600.47s]  a Shroomer dog.
[10605.38s -> 10607.38s]  Not even a day
[10607.38s -> 10609.38s]  old.
[10609.38s -> 10611.38s]  Not even one day
[10611.38s -> 10613.38s]  old. Both of them.
[10613.38s -> 10619.06s]  Shroomer and
[10619.06s -> 10623.48s]  Wonka.
[10623.48s -> 10627.70s]  Does it cost any money?
[10627.70s -> 10629.70s]  Petrin or Mushtan?
[10629.70s -> 10633.80s]  Unless you
[10633.80s -> 10639.11s]  actually select it now.
[10639.11s -> 10641.11s]  195...
[10641.11s -> 10650.82s]  145?
[10650.82s -> 10652.82s]  What the fuck?
[10652.82s -> 10658.38s]  What on
[10658.38s -> 10662.86s]  earth just happened?
[10662.86s -> 10664.86s]  An anonymous gifter
[10664.86s -> 10667.35s]  has just given a hundred community
[10667.35s -> 10669.72s]  subs. Anonymous gifter.
[10669.72s -> 10671.72s]  I don't know who you are,
[10671.72s -> 10673.90s]  but that's a lot.
[10673.90s -> 10680.15s]  That's a lot.
[10680.15s -> 10684.18s]  Whoever you are. Thank you
[10684.18s -> 10686.18s]  for the hundred subs.
[10686.18s -> 10699.54s]  Jesus. That's insane.
[10699.54s -> 10701.54s]  Thank you. Whoever you are.
[10701.54s -> 10703.54s]  Uh, I feel like both these
[10703.54s -> 10709.82s]  are terrible. Let me try...
[10709.82s -> 10712.89s]  That was so...
[10712.89s -> 10714.89s]  That was fucking crazy. Thank you.
[10714.89s -> 10717.06s]  What about Mao's and
[10717.06s -> 10720.26s]  Shroomer?
[10720.26s -> 10728.33s]  Kairotopia 5 community subs.
[10728.33s -> 10731.02s]  Oh my god.
[10733.32s -> 10737.16s]  That one sucks too.
[10737.16s -> 10739.16s]  Yeah, the subs are still rolling in.
[10739.16s -> 10743.06s]  My god.
[10743.06s -> 10745.43s]  What about Mao's and Wonka?
[10750.42s -> 10754.26s]  No, we're gonna get like
[10754.26s -> 10757.27s]  Mushtan.
[10757.27s -> 10759.27s]  195 health is kinda good though.
[10762.86s -> 10765.67s]  Magic Lore
[10765.67s -> 10767.98s]  and Pheromone.
[10767.98s -> 10769.98s]  Skills Pecking, Slap, and Pollen.
[10769.98s -> 10771.98s]  Nothing is the other one.
[10774.47s -> 10777.10s]  This character is terrible.
[10777.10s -> 10780.04s]  It's just another dumb shitty mushroom.
[10780.04s -> 10785.61s]  Let's go put some more CDs in.
[10785.61s -> 10791.11s]  Shroomer has good magic potential
[10791.11s -> 10797.90s]  to be combined here.
[10799.90s -> 10801.90s]  We, alright, the next few, we gotta
[10801.90s -> 10803.90s]  we gotta win some competitions here.
[10803.90s -> 10806.46s]  I'm gonna go with
[10806.46s -> 10808.46s]  we'll put in
[10808.46s -> 10810.46s]  I have humans here.
[10810.46s -> 10812.46s]  Oops. What is this? Something just fell out of this.
[10812.46s -> 10814.46s]  What CD is this? Whatever it is.
[10814.46s -> 10816.46s]  Alright, this is the thing that's going in next.
[10816.46s -> 10818.46s]  I don't even care.
[10818.46s -> 10820.46s]  The next thing going in is
[10820.46s -> 10822.46s]  MLB Show 17.
[10822.46s -> 10838.95s]  Okay. Boomers Sports.
[10838.95s -> 10840.95s]  Baseball is not a boomers sport.
[10840.95s -> 10844.33s]  Really?
[10844.33s -> 10846.33s]  Baseball is boomers sport?
[10846.33s -> 10850.74s]  Baseball has
[10850.74s -> 10853.43s]  been around for a
[10853.43s -> 10855.43s]  fucking hundred plus years.
[10855.43s -> 10859.59s]  They were playing baseball
[10859.59s -> 10861.59s]  back when K and Ben were throwing rocks at each other.
[10861.59s -> 10865.82s]  What do you mean exactly?
[10865.82s -> 10867.82s]  A baby boomer is
[10867.82s -> 10870.12s]  not from like
[10870.12s -> 10872.94s]  1880.
[10872.94s -> 10875.82s]  Do you guys think that they're still alive?
[10875.82s -> 10877.82s]  Yeah, fuck all those boomers
[10877.82s -> 10879.82s]  born in 1872.
[10879.82s -> 10887.94s]  Boomers are just old people.
[10887.94s -> 10893.32s]  A baby boomer didn't
[10893.32s -> 10902.47s]  invent baseball.
[10902.47s -> 10904.71s]  They did. No, they didn't.
[10904.71s -> 10907.14s]  What's after the boomers?
[10907.14s -> 10909.14s]  The pilgrims, I think, right?
[10909.14s -> 10911.14s]  I don't know.
[10911.14s -> 10913.14s]  What was, boomer was like the
[10913.14s -> 10915.14s]  30s and the 40s, right?
[10915.14s -> 10926.54s]  What was before boomer? Pilgrim?
[10926.54s -> 10934.92s]  Super boomers.
[10934.92s -> 10940.55s]  Nobody existed before
[10940.55s -> 10946.38s]  boomers. What the fuck
[10946.38s -> 10948.38s]  is this? Why do I keep getting this?
[10948.38s -> 10950.38s]  Something's wrong with my game.
[10950.38s -> 10956.58s]  Something's wrong with my game.
[10956.58s -> 10959.59s]  I don't know what's going on.
[10959.59s -> 10962.86s]  I have to, I'm going to turn the game off.
[10962.86s -> 10964.86s]  And turn it back on. Wait, I have to save it.
[10964.86s -> 10970.68s]  Don't do that yet. Alright.
[10970.68s -> 10972.68s]  Insert a CD or DVD.
[10972.68s -> 10975.11s]  If this is the same thing, then come on.
[10975.11s -> 10979.59s]  Something's fucked up here. Alright, here it is.
[10979.59s -> 10981.59s]  Here's, here's, here's Gorilla's Humans.
[10981.59s -> 10989.27s]  ESPRoot5 Community
[10989.27s -> 10991.27s]  Subs. Thank you ESPRoot
[10991.27s -> 11000.36s]  Subs. All over the place tonight.
[11000.36s -> 11003.62s]  Everywhere. If this is a shroom,
[11003.62s -> 11005.62s]  I'm going to reset the game. I'm going to save it and restart.
[11005.62s -> 11010.74s]  Maybe it's because these DVDs are too
[11010.74s -> 11012.74s]  new? Well, I mean, was Dreamcast
[11012.74s -> 11016.58s]  Dreamcast was
[11016.58s -> 11018.58s]  they were CDs, right? Not DVDs.
[11018.58s -> 11033.11s]  Dreamcast wasn't DVD ROM, was it?
[11033.11s -> 11035.86s]  Alright, let's see if we get the same thing.
[11035.86s -> 11037.86s]  If it is a shroom, then I'm going to save
[11037.86s -> 11039.86s]  a reset. And then we might
[11039.86s -> 11041.86s]  somebody said we have to play, I think. More than 60%
[11041.86s -> 11043.86s]  of the monsters are held behind A rank
[11043.86s -> 11045.86s]  as always. Well, that sucks.
[11045.86s -> 11048.23s]  I have to get to A rank. Just get
[11048.23s -> 11056.04s]  to A rank. That's all we have to do.
[11056.04s -> 11058.41s]  Okay. No shroom.
[11058.41s -> 11061.35s]  No mushroom. Something else.
[11061.35s -> 11076.90s]  Clam.
[11076.90s -> 11078.90s]  This thing is so cool. It's a walnut
[11078.90s -> 11082.81s]  fucking. Oh, it's a walnut.
[11082.81s -> 11084.81s]  It's like the inside of a walnut.
[11084.81s -> 11092.94s]  First time Fane has raised this
[11092.94s -> 11094.94s]  monster. Let me add page to your book.
[11094.94s -> 11100.06s]  Yes, I'm taking it.
[11100.06s -> 11102.06s]  WALL-E?
[11111.34s -> 11113.34s]  A bell? No, it's a walnut.
[11115.51s -> 11121.91s]  WALL-E. I like
[11121.91s -> 11125.18s]  WALL-E.
[11125.18s -> 11127.18s]  Nut, nut. Nut, nut
[11127.18s -> 11129.18s]  man. Why would nut man?
[11129.18s -> 11132.57s]  WALL-E.
[11132.57s -> 11137.62s]  It's not nut
[11137.62s -> 11139.99s]  man. It's
[11139.99s -> 11141.99s]  WALL-E.
[11141.99s -> 11143.99s]  Okay, look. You can call
[11143.99s -> 11145.99s]  them nut man if you want.
[11145.99s -> 11151.62s]  It's not. It's a
[11151.62s -> 11153.62s]  WALL-E. WALL-E.
[11153.62s -> 11156.25s]  WALL-E the walnut.
[11156.25s -> 11163.22s]  WALL-NUT
[11163.22s -> 11165.22s]  WALL-BURG.
[11165.22s -> 11172.52s]  Let's get another one. Alright, so our game is not broken.
[11172.52s -> 11174.52s]  We just got unlucky.
[11174.52s -> 11177.34s]  Let's go with one more.
[11177.34s -> 11189.10s]  Uh oh. Oh shit. This is just
[11189.10s -> 11194.41s]  this is the Monster Rancher 4 disc.
[11194.41s -> 11196.41s]  It didn't get, I pressed the button too early.
[11196.41s -> 11204.26s]  Uh, no.
[11207.02s -> 11209.32s]  Okay. Hey, at least they knew.
[11209.32s -> 11213.03s]  So what's going on now?
[11213.03s -> 11215.03s]  What do I got right here? I could put
[11215.03s -> 11217.03s]  Mr. Mosquito. PlayStation 2.
[11217.03s -> 11219.03s]  Urban Chaos. PlayStation. Let's do
[11219.03s -> 11228.57s]  Mr. Mosquito. Maybe we'll get a
[11228.57s -> 11231.90s]  Mosquito monster. Please stop playing
[11231.90s -> 11234.65s]  this game. What are you talking about?
[11234.65s -> 11237.08s]  This game is so much fun. It's so much
[11237.08s -> 11239.08s]  fun just to like just hang out and make fucking
[11239.08s -> 11245.93s]  monsters from discs. Alright, Mr.
[11245.93s -> 11251.11s]  Mosquito going in. Put in Monster
[11251.11s -> 11253.11s]  Rancher 3. I don't own it anymore. That's one of the things
[11253.11s -> 11256.06s]  I didn't bring because I hated
[11256.06s -> 11258.62s]  that game. I thought it was terrible.
[11258.62s -> 11261.05s]  This is a little different
[11261.05s -> 11263.05s]  but it's still, it's still
[11263.05s -> 11265.05s]  I'm getting enjoyment from it. I didn't like 3 at all.
[11265.05s -> 11268.44s]  3 was weird. 3 did this thing where you had to
[11268.44s -> 11271.26s]  like walk around and do
[11271.26s -> 11273.26s]  select like shiny things on the
[11273.26s -> 11275.26s]  ground to train. I didn't like
[11275.26s -> 11285.62s]  it. This reminds me more of 2
[11285.62s -> 11287.86s]  than 3.
[11287.86s -> 11289.86s]  Does of 2. What? Whatever.
[11289.86s -> 11295.94s]  So this is Mr.
[11295.94s -> 11305.03s]  Mosquito. I think a bug just came out of
[11305.03s -> 11308.47s]  that. No. Just, just packing
[11308.47s -> 11314.42s]  peanut. You didn't show us.
[11314.42s -> 11317.05s]  Oh fuck. Oh well. Could have been anything.
[11317.05s -> 11321.66s]  I could be lying to you right now. I could be just
[11321.66s -> 11324.22s]  making that whole thing up. Here, look
[11324.22s -> 11326.22s]  I'll show you the disc. I'll show you. Just so you know
[11326.22s -> 11329.54s]  this thing was expensive too guys.
[11329.54s -> 11335.69s]  This was no, I gotta be careful
[11335.69s -> 11337.69s]  with this one. This was expensive.
[11337.69s -> 11341.34s]  Mr. Mosquito
[11341.34s -> 11343.34s]  from Eidos Interactive.
[11343.34s -> 11355.16s]  This was fucking, it was like 40
[11355.16s -> 11360.41s]  bucks. Let's go!
[11360.41s -> 11371.42s]  Break it in half. Okay fine, sure dude.
[11374.68s -> 11379.16s]  Fuck! Alright, yeah
[11379.16s -> 11381.16s]  excuse me. I'll take the fucking
[11381.16s -> 11383.16s]  Bear Swordsman. Holy
[11383.16s -> 11386.55s]  shit. I'll take the Power Ranger.
[11386.55s -> 11394.55s]  Yep. Robo Bear
[11394.55s -> 11401.46s]  Swordsman.
[11401.46s -> 11409.46s]  That's BB
[11413.18s -> 11415.18s]  This thing's cool. I'm gonna forget about
[11415.18s -> 11417.61s]  the other 2 characters. I don't care. Robo
[11417.61s -> 11420.55s]  BBs.
[11420.55s -> 11422.55s]  Robo Boomer. No.
[11422.55s -> 11424.55s]  This is not gonna be Robo Boomer.
[11424.55s -> 11426.55s]  Uh, how about
[11426.55s -> 11429.88s]  Robo Boomer.
[11431.88s -> 11433.88s]  Ugh, this is tough.
[11438.55s -> 11440.55s]  Slash. No. Uh
[11443.50s -> 11446.70s]  Bean Bag Boomer.
[11446.70s -> 11452.20s]  Oh that's a, that's a really good one.
[11452.20s -> 11454.20s]  I'll use that one. That's a good one. Dick Fart.
[11454.20s -> 11456.74s]  Yeah, sure.
[11456.74s -> 11459.11s]  That's a really good one. I'll do it.
[11466.97s -> 11470.30s]  This is a Dark Souls character?
[11470.30s -> 11472.30s]  Oh, you're getting invaded by, what's his name?
[11472.30s -> 11474.30s]  It's a bunch of asterisks.
[11474.30s -> 11476.47s]  Who's this? Invaded by Dick Fart
[11476.47s -> 11478.47s]  222222222223.
[11485.30s -> 11487.61s]  What's a, okay, what's like a
[11487.61s -> 11489.61s]  thrust or
[11489.61s -> 11493.82s]  the Hibernator.
[11493.82s -> 11495.82s]  Hibernator.
[11495.82s -> 11497.82s]  That's a little bit of Robo theme in a bear.
[11497.82s -> 11499.82s]  Hibernator.
[11499.82s -> 11501.82s]  What, no it is a bear. Bear's Hibernator.
[11501.82s -> 11503.82s]  Why would I have to have bear in there?
[11505.82s -> 11507.82s]  Hibernator.
[11507.82s -> 11509.82s]  Hyperba, Hyperbator.
[11520.46s -> 11522.46s]  Master.
[11522.46s -> 11524.46s]  Master.
[11527.02s -> 11529.02s]  Hyper, Hyperbator.
[11533.02s -> 11535.02s]  I, okay.
[11535.02s -> 11540.33s]  Hyperbator.
[11540.33s -> 11542.33s]  Why would I do that? You guys, what's,
[11542.33s -> 11544.33s]  you guys usually are pretty good.
[11550.90s -> 11552.90s]  I can't fit that.
[11555.46s -> 11559.50s]  I can, I can only have like
[11559.50s -> 11562.44s]  seven letters, guys.
[11567.82s -> 11571.32s]  Uhhhhh.
[11571.32s -> 11574.20s]  I gotta get out of here.
[11596.70s -> 11599.00s]  Robare?
[11599.00s -> 11602.70s]  Robare?
[11606.70s -> 11619.74s]  Roberto?
[11619.74s -> 11627.02s]  Roberto.
[11627.02s -> 11629.51s]  This thing's awesome.
[11629.51s -> 11632.78s]  What would it be? Back to the ranch, let's see.
[11632.78s -> 11635.02s]  This is gonna probably have, probably have
[11635.02s -> 11637.02s]  such ridiculous
[11637.02s -> 11646.23s]  stats. So I've got
[11646.23s -> 11648.47s]  Wally, Vroomer, and
[11648.47s -> 11652.57s]  Roberto.
[11652.57s -> 11656.92s]  Uhhhhh.
[11656.92s -> 11658.92s]  Actually not terrible base stats.
[11658.92s -> 11661.48s]  High defense, decent
[11661.48s -> 11667.37s]  power. It's all about power.
[11667.37s -> 11669.74s]  Okay, what do you got? You got
[11669.74s -> 11671.74s]  kick and charge.
[11671.74s -> 11673.74s]  Where's slash? You have a
[11673.74s -> 11678.34s]  sword in your hand.
[11678.34s -> 11680.34s]  Um, hold on a second, but guys
[11680.34s -> 11682.34s]  this is life damage B.
[11682.34s -> 11685.67s]  That's a lot of damage.
[11691.03s -> 11693.03s]  What's that? What is it? 22 guts?
[11693.03s -> 11695.03s]  That's not very much at all. This thing
[11695.03s -> 11697.77s]  actually could be pretty good.
[11697.77s -> 11699.77s]  Alright, what about your stats? Your uh,
[11699.77s -> 11702.01s]  golden foot.
[11702.01s -> 11704.25s]  Increases the power of moves that
[11704.25s -> 11707.06s]  use the feet. But you
[11707.06s -> 11709.06s]  have a sword in your hand.
[11709.06s -> 11711.06s]  You've got a golden foot.
[11711.06s -> 11714.70s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[11714.70s -> 11717.19s]  Alright, Wally, what about you?
[11717.19s -> 11719.19s]  Holy shit, look at that defense.
[11719.19s -> 11721.62s]  That's the best. Pure walnut
[11721.62s -> 11723.62s]  defense. And pretty high intelligence
[11723.62s -> 11728.04s]  too. This is probably the best character.
[11728.04s -> 11730.04s]  Look at the base defense.
[11730.04s -> 11732.86s]  Alright, we got some moves here. We got
[11732.86s -> 11735.48s]  life damage C.
[11735.48s -> 11737.48s]  That's not terrible. Pretty bad accuracy
[11737.48s -> 11739.48s]  rate though. What about this one?
[11739.48s -> 11741.48s]  This is called Cracker.
[11741.48s -> 11744.87s]  Not bad.
[11744.87s -> 11747.56s]  It adds addle to whatever that means.
[11747.56s -> 11749.99s]  Not bad.
[11751.99s -> 11754.87s]  What about you? Hard shell.
[11754.87s -> 11756.87s]  Reduces damage but harder to dodge
[11756.87s -> 11759.24s]  attacks. Okay.
[11759.24s -> 11761.24s]  And what's that element?
[11761.24s -> 11763.99s]  I don't know what element is.
[11763.99s -> 11767.06s]  Is it a teal? I don't know.
[11767.06s -> 11772.89s]  It's a wolf with a katana and you
[11772.89s -> 11774.89s]  didn't name him Sekiro. As a bear.
[11774.89s -> 11780.58s]  Maybe it is a wolf.
[11780.58s -> 11783.38s]  So it is a wolf.
[11783.38s -> 11785.38s]  But it's okay.
[11785.38s -> 11787.38s]  Just pretend it's a bear. That's a bear.
[11787.38s -> 11792.63s]  Alright.
[11792.63s -> 11794.63s]  So how do I... This is going to be interesting.
[11794.63s -> 11796.63s]  Oh fuck.
[11796.63s -> 11798.63s]  So.
[11798.63s -> 11800.63s]  Everybody has their own schedule.
[11800.63s -> 11803.00s]  Oh dear.
[11803.00s -> 11805.00s]  This is going to be micromanagement
[11805.00s -> 11807.00s]  of the video game.
[11807.00s -> 11809.00s]  So.
[11809.00s -> 11811.00s]  Let's see. Let's do
[11811.00s -> 11816.63s]  more defense. What do you need?
[11816.63s -> 11821.86s]  You need
[11821.86s -> 11825.26s]  your highest stat
[11825.26s -> 11827.26s]  is defense and intelligence.
[11827.26s -> 11829.75s]  Your moves...
[11829.75s -> 11831.75s]  The best move that you have
[11831.75s -> 11835.00s]  is
[11835.00s -> 11837.00s]  a power move.
[11837.00s -> 11839.00s]  But you have higher intelligence so this will probably do
[11839.00s -> 11841.00s]  more damage. So I'm going to say
[11841.00s -> 11843.18s]  increase intelligence. Intelligence
[11843.18s -> 11845.18s]  and defense. Intelligence, defense and
[11845.18s -> 11847.18s]  life. We'll start with here.
[11847.18s -> 11863.80s]  Give you a good schedule
[11863.80s -> 11865.80s]  here.
[11865.80s -> 11870.97s]  Three in a row.
[11870.97s -> 11873.34s]  Okay.
[11873.34s -> 11875.34s]  That looks alright.
[11875.34s -> 11877.34s]  We need one more here.
[11877.34s -> 11879.34s]  One more in
[11879.34s -> 11882.02s]  life.
[11882.02s -> 11884.02s]  Got two days of rest.
[11884.02s -> 11886.02s]  What about
[11886.02s -> 11888.02s]  you? So you have...
[11888.02s -> 11890.02s]  What's his moves?
[11890.02s -> 11893.48s]  He's kind of all over the place.
[11893.48s -> 11896.79s]  Power? Does he have any
[11896.79s -> 11898.79s]  intelligence moves? No.
[11898.79s -> 11900.79s]  It's all about power. So power.
[11900.79s -> 11903.10s]  Power, accuracy and life.
[11903.10s -> 11906.23s]  I would say. Or speed.
[11906.23s -> 11910.07s]  I'm going to do power, life and speed.
[11910.07s -> 11912.07s]  Because that defense is already high enough for now.
[11912.07s -> 11914.07s]  Power, life, speed.
[11919.08s -> 11926.17s]  Is it okay to clear the schedules
[11926.17s -> 11928.17s]  to other monsters using this gadget?
[11928.17s -> 11930.17s]  Oh, shit.
[11930.17s -> 11932.34s]  Okay. They can't do it
[11932.34s -> 11934.34s]  at the same time.
[11938.90s -> 11941.85s]  Oh, fuck. Okay. So
[11941.85s -> 11943.85s]  it's trampoline.
[11943.85s -> 11949.21s]  What was it?
[11949.21s -> 11951.21s]  Power, life and speed.
[11951.21s -> 11953.21s]  You can do the high jump.
[11953.21s -> 11955.21s]  We'll do trampoline on this day.
[11955.21s -> 11958.02s]  Rest.
[11958.02s -> 11960.02s]  Let's give you some life.
[11960.02s -> 11963.10s]  And we'll do
[11963.10s -> 11965.10s]  power again.
[11965.10s -> 11967.10s]  Rest.
[11967.10s -> 11969.72s]  And...
[11969.72s -> 11971.72s]  trampoline again.
[11971.72s -> 11973.72s]  Oh, you motherfucker. Who is doing it to this day?
[11973.72s -> 11977.43s]  You are.
[11977.43s -> 11979.43s]  You're using the speed.
[11979.43s -> 11981.43s]  You're doing fine.
[11981.43s -> 11983.43s]  No. What day are you not doing this?
[11983.43s -> 11985.43s]  I'm going to switch
[11985.43s -> 11989.78s]  these dates here.
[11989.78s -> 11991.78s]  Trampoline.
[11991.78s -> 11993.78s]  Target.
[11998.66s -> 12000.66s]  Okay. Now, you can do
[12003.67s -> 12005.67s]  trampoline.
[12007.85s -> 12009.85s]  There we go. I think we're ready.
[12009.85s -> 12012.28s]  Go for it.
[12014.28s -> 12019.58s]  So we had
[12019.58s -> 12022.20s]  rumors resting.
[12022.20s -> 12024.20s]  Wall-E plus six.
[12024.20s -> 12026.20s]  Roberto plus
[12026.20s -> 12028.63s]  six. Let's go take a look at what
[12028.63s -> 12030.63s]  they're doing. So we're just making a carnival
[12030.63s -> 12032.63s]  of monsters.
[12032.63s -> 12036.97s]  Good training.
[12036.97s -> 12041.70s]  You're doing great.
[12041.70s -> 12043.70s]  I don't even remember what the training was for this.
[12043.70s -> 12052.07s]  Where's Roberto?
[12052.07s -> 12054.07s]  He just took his arm off.
[12054.07s -> 12061.03s]  I think they're dumb.
[12061.03s -> 12066.22s]  Oh, no. Yay!
[12066.22s -> 12068.22s]  I'm having so much fun.
[12068.22s -> 12072.62s]  It's gold. No, I can't do that.
[12072.62s -> 12074.62s]  You're too cute.
[12074.62s -> 12081.85s]  I think this is going to be our
[12081.85s -> 12083.85s]  very special boy.
[12083.85s -> 12085.85s]  The other two. Who cares?
[12085.85s -> 12088.92s]  Well, actually, everybody loves the beanie baby.
[12088.92s -> 12092.12s]  I think this guy sucks.
[12092.12s -> 12095.90s]  Yeah, I might as well just throw
[12095.90s -> 12097.90s]  you into the freezer right now.
[12097.90s -> 12100.33s]  But we'll just leave. We'll see what happens.
[12100.33s -> 12102.33s]  I can only do one command,
[12102.33s -> 12104.33s]  right? Can I do anything else today?
[12104.33s -> 12106.33s]  Holy shit.
[12106.33s -> 12108.89s]  If that's going to hurt me.
[12108.89s -> 12110.89s]  I can do one command per
[12110.89s -> 12114.47s]  You are so cool,
[12114.47s -> 12116.47s]  but so dumb at the same time.
[12116.47s -> 12118.47s]  How are you doing? Are you doing okay?
[12118.47s -> 12120.47s]  Here, have some data.
[12120.47s -> 12126.17s]  Reason?
[12126.17s -> 12128.17s]  No, we're going to take him into tournaments.
[12128.17s -> 12131.99s]  Give him a chance, you know?
[12131.99s -> 12133.99s]  Alright. Not hungry, not hungry,
[12133.99s -> 12138.79s]  not hungry. Weekend activities.
[12148.06s -> 12150.06s]  I get three actions per week now. That's actually pretty good.
[12150.06s -> 12153.19s]  Uh oh.
[12153.19s -> 12156.65s]  Fane, wake up. Something's happened.
[12156.65s -> 12158.65s]  Oh, morning reel. What is it?
[12158.65s -> 12161.72s]  Somebody die.
[12161.72s -> 12163.72s]  Change those pants.
[12163.72s -> 12167.11s]  I don't even know what that's implying.
[12167.11s -> 12170.31s]  Sorry, just a second. I'll put something on.
[12170.31s -> 12172.31s]  Did I go to the bathroom with my pants?
[12172.31s -> 12175.26s]  Was I wearing pants?
[12175.26s -> 12177.26s]  This one,
[12177.26s -> 12179.26s]  this one found this this morning.
[12179.26s -> 12182.01s]  Was this giant cave here before?
[12182.01s -> 12184.25s]  No, I've never seen it before.
[12184.25s -> 12189.75s]  And I feel some strange power.
[12189.75s -> 12191.75s]  It seems like it's beckoning us.
[12191.75s -> 12195.85s]  Beckoning us? How cool.
[12195.85s -> 12199.11s]  Let's take the monsters and investigate.
[12199.11s -> 12201.11s]  What a cave doing here.
[12201.11s -> 12204.12s]  I'll have to investigate.
[12204.12s -> 12206.62s]  Excuse me, but who are you?
[12206.62s -> 12208.62s]  Me?
[12208.62s -> 12210.62s]  I'm in charge of the investigation of these parts.
[12210.62s -> 12212.62s]  Call me Mr. K.
[12212.62s -> 12215.11s]  And how about you kids?
[12215.11s -> 12217.11s]  Are you in charge of an investigation of this cave too?
[12217.11s -> 12219.93s]  Yes, that's why we're here.
[12219.93s -> 12222.74s]  Well, that's just splendid.
[12222.74s -> 12225.24s]  But you know, I'm a bit worried for you.
[12225.24s -> 12227.24s]  Let's take the monsters inside.
[12227.24s -> 12229.80s]  I have an idea.
[12229.80s -> 12231.80s]  Let the adventurer Mr. K.
[12231.80s -> 12233.80s]  tell you the ins and outs of exploring.
[12233.80s -> 12236.49s]  Is it going to be a tutorial?
[12236.49s -> 12238.49s]  Fuck the voice.
[12238.49s -> 12240.49s]  Finish all your preparations by the weekend.
[12240.49s -> 12242.49s]  Then meet me in front of the cave this weekend.
[12242.49s -> 12244.66s]  Until then.
[12244.66s -> 12246.66s]  Tata, he's gone. What a strange old man.
[12246.66s -> 12249.48s]  He seems like a nice guy.
[12249.48s -> 12255.56s]  And it might be fun to go exploring this weekend.
[12255.56s -> 12257.56s]  So this weekend, go exploring.
[12257.56s -> 12261.78s]  Who do I want to bring? Can I bring everybody?
[12261.78s -> 12266.71s]  What's the schedule?
[12266.71s -> 12268.71s]  Speed. Whoa.
[12268.71s -> 12270.71s]  Holy shit.
[12270.71s -> 12272.95s]  That was a lot.
[12272.95s -> 12274.95s]  Vroomer plus 16 speed.
[12274.95s -> 12276.95s]  Wally, 6 defense, 8 power for Roberto.
[12276.95s -> 12278.95s]  That was a lot.
[12278.95s -> 12280.95s]  That was like a critical hit.
[12280.95s -> 12282.95s]  Wow.
[12282.95s -> 12293.18s]  Good job.
[12293.18s -> 12297.91s]  Okay, how are you doing?
[12297.91s -> 12299.91s]  Okay, okay. He's kind of hungry.
[12301.91s -> 12303.91s]  What do robots eat?
[12303.91s -> 12309.48s]  That was pretty bad.
[12309.48s -> 12311.48s]  Actually pretty cool. That was awesome.
[12311.48s -> 12313.48s]  Yeah.
[12313.48s -> 12315.48s]  You get to stick around. That was awesome.
[12315.48s -> 12317.48s]  What about you?
[12317.48s -> 12319.48s]  Are you hungry?
[12319.48s -> 12323.83s]  Not yet.
[12323.83s -> 12327.10s]  Continue your training.
[12327.10s -> 12333.62s]  Alright, let's see the weekend activity.
[12333.62s -> 12336.25s]  Well, the weekend is here and I assume you're fully prepared.
[12336.25s -> 12338.25s]  Well then, we're off.
[12338.25s -> 12340.25s]  Mr. K., the adventurer, will be your guide on this fabulous expedition.
[12340.25s -> 12344.14s]  So is this just
[12344.14s -> 12346.14s]  adventure?
[12346.14s -> 12348.38s]  I've been raised exploring.
[12348.38s -> 12351.56s]  A toggle cave.
[12351.56s -> 12353.56s]  A mysterious cave found behind the
[12353.56s -> 12355.56s]  ranch one day.
[12355.56s -> 12357.56s]  Select monsters to explore with.
[12361.99s -> 12365.19s]  Wally? Who should go?
[12365.19s -> 12367.19s]  Who's like...
[12367.19s -> 12369.19s]  Roberto is the least.
[12372.14s -> 12376.81s]  Or maybe Vroomer.
[12376.81s -> 12379.80s]  Yeah.
[12379.80s -> 12385.43s]  Or if it's dangerous.
[12385.43s -> 12387.43s]  High defense maybe?
[12387.43s -> 12389.61s]  Let's throw Wally in there.
[12389.61s -> 12393.45s]  We can take everybody.
[12393.45s -> 12395.45s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12395.45s -> 12397.45s]  What the hell is this?
[12399.45s -> 12401.45s]  This is turning into an iPad game.
[12401.45s -> 12405.35s]  713 energy.
[12407.66s -> 12413.48s]  Okay, I guess.
[12413.48s -> 12415.48s]  Let's go.
[12419.00s -> 12421.00s]  Go exploring with these monsters.
[12421.00s -> 12423.00s]  Yeah.
[12423.00s -> 12434.84s]  First floor of the toggle caves.
[12434.84s -> 12438.62s]  Let's start with the basics.
[12438.62s -> 12440.62s]  Left analog stick move.
[12440.62s -> 12442.62s]  You can move the camera with the right analog stick.
[12442.62s -> 12444.62s]  First try going to the treasure chest ahead of you.
[12444.62s -> 12446.62s]  The hell?
[12446.62s -> 12459.21s]  When in front of the chest push X to open it.
[12459.21s -> 12461.21s]  This is a different game.
[12461.21s -> 12466.89s]  What is it?
[12466.89s -> 12468.89s]  Received yarn ball.
[12468.89s -> 12470.89s]  Well, this yarn ball is yours now.
[12470.89s -> 12473.06s]  Keep it safe.
[12473.06s -> 12475.06s]  Sometimes chests are hidden when you get near a suspicious location.
[12475.06s -> 12477.06s]  The cursor appears.
[12477.06s -> 12483.66s]  Suspicious location.
[12483.66s -> 12485.83s]  Should I explore around?
[12485.83s -> 12487.83s]  I'm running out of time.
[12487.83s -> 12489.83s]  The top left is, I think, their total health pool or something.
[12498.54s -> 12500.54s]  That's how much energy they have.
[12500.54s -> 12502.54s]  Go close to a suspicious spot and look for the cursor.
[12502.54s -> 12517.11s]  This is not a suspicious spot.
[12517.11s -> 12523.26s]  Alright.
[12523.26s -> 12525.26s]  There's a mouse hole over here.
[12525.26s -> 12529.54s]  That's it. Now push the X right there.
[12529.54s -> 12531.54s]  Except you don't have a monster to search it right now.
[12531.54s -> 12533.54s]  How?
[12533.54s -> 12536.30s]  Let's move on. We'll search for stray monsters.
[12536.30s -> 12541.86s]  What are we talking about?
[12541.86s -> 12545.38s]  Can I select a different monster?
[12545.38s -> 12547.38s]  You can't fit in there or something? I don't get it.
[12547.38s -> 12549.38s]  Command.
[12549.38s -> 12555.26s]  Sword.
[12555.26s -> 12557.69s]  This is too big.
[12557.69s -> 12560.18s]  What about the walnut?
[12560.18s -> 12567.80s]  Whatever. Apparently I can't do it again anyways.
[12567.80s -> 12569.80s]  We're stray monsters.
[12569.80s -> 12572.68s]  Well, I think I just ran into...
[12572.68s -> 12576.38s]  Random encounters?
[12583.10s -> 12585.46s]  Alright, it's one of the flowers.
[12585.46s -> 12593.53s]  Here's the question.
[12593.53s -> 12595.53s]  So I have to...
[12595.53s -> 12597.53s]  Is this like Marvel vs. Capcom?
[12597.53s -> 12605.98s]  Can I pull in other people?
[12605.98s -> 12609.88s]  It's kill or be killed.
[12609.88s -> 12611.88s]  Experience plus 13.
[12611.88s -> 12617.50s]  Level 1.
[12617.50s -> 12619.50s]  Interesting.
[12619.50s -> 12621.50s]  Win battles to raise experience points.
[12621.50s -> 12623.50s]  As you level up, new skills, traits, and items can be obtained.
[12623.50s -> 12628.10s]  This is how you get new moves.
[12628.10s -> 12637.54s]  If you lose a battle, your experience, skills, and items remain, but you will return to your range fatigued.
[12637.54s -> 12645.05s]  Using Quit Exploring on the circle button, set square, is the same.
[12645.05s -> 12651.93s]  When you quit exploring, your monster becomes exhausted, and its lifespan is shortened.
[12651.93s -> 12653.93s]  What? You mean it won't live as long?
[12653.93s -> 12655.93s]  Nope. It's a cruel world.
[12655.93s -> 12660.22s]  What an explanation.
[12660.22s -> 12662.22s]  See the gauge on the lower left of the screen?
[12662.22s -> 12664.22s]  That's the energy gauge, and it lowers over time.
[12664.22s -> 12669.29s]  It's essential to exploration.
[12669.29s -> 12671.29s]  It lowers each time you move.
[12671.29s -> 12673.29s]  And when it reaches zero, your monster's life lowers.
[12673.29s -> 12675.29s]  Watch it carefully.
[12675.29s -> 12677.59s]  Does energy ever rise?
[12677.59s -> 12679.59s]  No, it does not rise.
[12679.59s -> 12685.59s]  But while you have energy, the life of the monsters that took damage during battle will gradually recover.
[12685.59s -> 12689.59s]  So run too much, and our exploring will be cut short.
[12689.59s -> 12691.59s]  Every floor has a staircase to the next floor.
[12691.59s -> 12697.59s]  If you make it there, you can return to your range without taking heavy damage, or go to the next floor.
[12697.59s -> 12701.59s]  Important choice, I suggest not getting too greedy in this respect.
[12701.59s -> 12704.09s]  I guess that's all. The rest is up to you.
[12704.09s -> 12706.09s]  Well, do your best.
[12706.09s -> 12715.29s]  I kind of don't want to do this.
[12715.29s -> 12721.51s]  I'm going to drain their life essence forever.
[12721.51s -> 12725.74s]  Something bats?
[12725.74s -> 12730.73s]  What about chests?
[12730.73s -> 12742.30s]  Nothing? Nothing to investigate? Nothing to look at?
[12742.30s -> 12749.66s]  I still have plenty of energy.
[12749.66s -> 12758.74s]  This is cool.
[12758.74s -> 12766.42s]  Alright, so we get a Mogie E.
[12766.42s -> 12770.01s]  R2...
[12770.01s -> 12772.01s]  Just...
[12772.01s -> 12774.01s]  Okay, L1 brings out another monster.
[12774.01s -> 12777.91s]  Alright, let's see what we got.
[12777.91s -> 12779.91s]  Timidity.
[12779.91s -> 12785.54s]  Alright, I don't want you to lose health, because you're my favorite.
[12785.54s -> 12787.54s]  What about the other move? Let's see it.
[12787.54s -> 12792.60s]  Team Up!
[12792.60s -> 12795.99s]  What does that mean?
[12795.99s -> 12797.99s]  Dodge. Dodge again.
[12797.99s -> 12804.07s]  Nice.
[12804.07s -> 12806.07s]  I want to do the other move, but he can't.
[12806.07s -> 12808.07s]  Let's bring in Beartow.
[12808.07s -> 12811.34s]  He's a little timid.
[12811.34s -> 12814.09s]  Kicks do more damage, right?
[12814.09s -> 12823.74s]  There we go.
[12823.74s -> 12833.58s]  Nobody did damage.
[12833.58s -> 12836.07s]  Fucking decimated.
[12836.07s -> 12843.88s]  Cool.
[12843.88s -> 12846.76s]  654.
[12846.76s -> 12848.76s]  Two paths that we can go down here.
[12848.76s -> 12853.56s]  Let's check the one on the left.
[12853.56s -> 12855.56s]  Okay, I kind of want a smaller monster out here.
[12855.56s -> 12857.56s]  Because you take up almost the whole screen.
[12857.56s -> 12861.08s]  Chest.
[12861.08s -> 12869.08s]  Obtain Junk Toy.
[12869.08s -> 12877.56s]  How are you that big?
[12877.56s -> 12880.38s]  Okay, well I got a toy.
[12880.38s -> 12890.68s]  Where do you corpse?
[12890.68s -> 12899.00s]  Oops.
[12899.00s -> 12902.58s]  Oh dear.
[12902.58s -> 12905.08s]  Meeklon E.
[12905.08s -> 12908.15s]  That's a cool little monster.
[12908.15s -> 12911.99s]  It's like a giant beetle.
[12911.99s -> 12917.43s]  E for easy, yeah.
[12917.43s -> 12919.43s]  They do have different ranks.
[12919.43s -> 12924.62s]  Obtained Rose Perfume.
[12924.62s -> 12930.44s]  You skipped the dance.
[12930.44s -> 12933.58s]  You've seen the dance a million times.
[12933.58s -> 12936.07s]  You don't have to see it every single time.
[12936.07s -> 12938.07s]  Chest. Good.
[12938.07s -> 12944.71s]  I definitely like this more than the last one.
[12944.71s -> 12946.71s]  Because this same idea was in the last one.
[12946.71s -> 12948.71s]  Because this same idea was in
[12948.71s -> 12950.71s]  Monster Rancher 3.
[12950.71s -> 12952.95s]  But this feels more fun to do.
[12952.95s -> 12955.70s]  Than the other one.
[12955.70s -> 12961.98s]  Don't ever skip.
[12961.98s -> 12965.37s]  I still have 600 points.
[12965.37s -> 12967.93s]  Should I get out of here?
[12967.93s -> 12969.93s]  That was like a little tutorial. I don't want to drain them.
[12969.93s -> 12972.49s]  Stay here forward.
[12972.49s -> 12978.18s]  Or ranch.
[12978.18s -> 12983.18s]  Let's go. Second floor.
[12983.18s -> 12988.23s]  We have to see the other command here.
[12988.23s -> 12990.23s]  We have to see how the other run.
[12990.23s -> 12992.23s]  How do you run, Roberto?
[12992.23s -> 12997.22s]  You all have a really loud,
[12997.22s -> 12999.40s]  annoying sound.
[12999.40s -> 13002.92s]  But that's okay.
[13002.92s -> 13004.92s]  Can I touch this?
[13004.92s -> 13007.78s]  What is it?
[13007.78s -> 13009.78s]  Roberto can't help you to investigate.
[13009.78s -> 13012.28s]  I know who might.
[13012.28s -> 13016.50s]  Not Wally.
[13016.50s -> 13018.50s]  Can the rumor jump up there? Like bounce up there?
[13018.50s -> 13022.02s]  Rumor can't help you investigate.
[13025.72s -> 13030.46s]  Wally can't help you investigate.
[13030.46s -> 13035.32s]  Why? Why are you all so stupid?
[13035.32s -> 13037.93s]  Whatever.
[13037.93s -> 13043.05s]  Maybe they have to be able to fly?
[13043.05s -> 13062.57s]  To get up there?
[13062.57s -> 13066.98s]  Chest! Playing cards!
[13066.98s -> 13070.70s]  That's cool.
[13070.70s -> 13072.70s]  Nobody can fit in here.
[13072.70s -> 13074.70s]  Can you fit in there? Are you big enough?
[13074.70s -> 13081.35s]  Wally can't help you.
[13081.35s -> 13091.14s]  Yu-Gi-Oh! Battle cards.
[13091.14s -> 13093.14s]  Ant Coro E.
[13096.66s -> 13099.48s]  What are they?
[13099.48s -> 13101.48s]  I think these are Sesame Street characters.
[13101.48s -> 13103.48s]  I want to do this move.
[13103.48s -> 13108.79s]  That's a cool move.
[13108.79s -> 13112.06s]  It's like a party blaster.
[13112.06s -> 13116.73s]  Stop being so timid. Stop!
[13116.73s -> 13119.61s]  That's the thorns.
[13119.61s -> 13122.81s]  You be in time. Bring in the drift.
[13122.81s -> 13130.23s]  It's one of those little party poppers.
[13130.23s -> 13137.32s]  As you buy the gas station.
[13137.32s -> 13143.98s]  Rumor almost level 2.
[13143.98s -> 13147.18s]  Isabel side smash?
[13147.18s -> 13149.42s]  Is that what Isabel does?
[13149.42s -> 13156.20s]  This is a green chest.
[13156.20s -> 13161.13s]  Obtained a life tablet.
[13161.13s -> 13163.13s]  What's this? Something strange is inside.
[13163.13s -> 13165.50s]  A stone tablet. It seems very old.
[13165.50s -> 13167.50s]  The writing seems to explain something.
[13167.50s -> 13169.86s]  A blueprint.
[13169.86s -> 13172.04s]  You're right. That's really interesting.
[13172.04s -> 13174.04s]  But why do I have the feeling that I've seen this before?
[13174.04s -> 13178.57s]  Really?
[13178.57s -> 13180.81s]  I suppose it's nothing.
[13180.81s -> 13182.81s]  Anyway, we found something really neat.
[13182.81s -> 13184.81s]  This is enough exploring for now.
[13184.81s -> 13189.16s]  Alright.
[13189.16s -> 13191.16s]  So the life tablet, I'm gonna assume when you combine it
[13191.16s -> 13193.16s]  you can add it and add extra life.
[13193.16s -> 13197.26s]  Or you can just consume it and put...
[13197.26s -> 13209.10s]  He left before I did.
[13209.10s -> 13212.87s]  Rio is just baked.
[13212.87s -> 13215.05s]  Hello. I invited myself in.
[13215.05s -> 13217.22s]  Guess you're out and about.
[13217.22s -> 13219.59s]  Yeah, I guess you could say that.
[13219.59s -> 13221.59s]  What's that stone you have there? Let me have a look.
[13221.59s -> 13223.90s]  This I found in the cave.
[13223.90s -> 13226.39s]  Do you know anything about it?
[13226.39s -> 13228.39s]  This design, these joints, looks like a blueprint
[13228.39s -> 13231.40s]  for a training gadget.
[13231.40s -> 13233.40s]  Wait a minute. Does that mean that people from ages
[13233.40s -> 13235.40s]  past use training gadgets too?
[13235.40s -> 13237.83s]  If that's the case, then this is a real discovery.
[13237.83s -> 13240.46s]  What?
[13240.46s -> 13242.82s]  Could I ask you a favor, Fane?
[13242.82s -> 13244.82s]  Could I borrow this from you?
[13244.82s -> 13247.19s]  I want to try recreating the ancient
[13247.19s -> 13249.19s]  training gadget described in these blueprints.
[13249.19s -> 13251.50s]  Sure, go right ahead.
[13251.50s -> 13253.50s]  Oh, I'll go exploring again and look for more.
[13253.50s -> 13255.86s]  Oh, actually, I'll give you the training
[13255.86s -> 13258.62s]  gadget as soon as it's done.
[13258.62s -> 13260.62s]  A chance to recreate a training gadget with my
[13260.62s -> 13263.24s]  very own hands.
[13263.24s -> 13265.61s]  Oh, it's just amazing.
[13265.61s -> 13267.61s]  I've got to get started right away by then.
[13267.61s -> 13270.49s]  Public looks so happy.
[13270.49s -> 13273.11s]  We've got to go exploring again.
[13273.11s -> 13280.73s]  How's everybody doing? Okay, we've got
[13280.73s -> 13282.73s]  more training sessions.
[13282.73s -> 13285.61s]  You're a little tired, but well...
[13285.61s -> 13287.61s]  Anybody scheduled to sleep right now?
[13289.61s -> 13293.24s]  Week one. Exercise,
[13293.24s -> 13296.50s]  rest, and trampoline.
[13296.50s -> 13300.15s]  Okay. Let's get to it.
[13300.15s -> 13307.19s]  Rumor's been
[13307.19s -> 13309.19s]  on point with the training recently.
[13309.19s -> 13311.50s]  Roberto, I'm going to scald you.
[13311.50s -> 13316.23s]  I mean, you didn't even try.
[13316.23s -> 13321.67s]  You just, you didn't even try.
[13321.67s -> 13325.51s]  Sorry.
[13325.51s -> 13334.97s]  He could have killed you.
[13334.97s -> 13341.62s]  You did really good, though. He thought about it.
[13341.62s -> 13343.99s]  And you're asleep. Good.
[13343.99s -> 13346.55s]  Anybody hungry?
[13346.55s -> 13351.10s]  Not really. Everything's all right.
[13351.10s -> 13353.10s]  Are you hungry?
[13353.10s -> 13360.46s]  So you can go
[13360.46s -> 13362.46s]  on an adventure. I can do this whenever I want.
[13362.46s -> 13364.46s]  That's cool.
[13364.46s -> 13367.27s]  Do I have to find a new place?
[13367.27s -> 13369.27s]  Probably have to find a new place to do it, right?
[13375.88s -> 13380.23s]  I like the snow.
[13380.23s -> 13382.23s]  It's nice.
[13382.23s -> 13384.23s]  What do we got on schedule now?
[13384.23s -> 13387.37s]  We've got exercise,
[13387.37s -> 13389.37s]  power, balance,
[13389.37s -> 13391.37s]  and you are going to rest.
[13391.37s -> 13394.06s]  Yeah, you're frustrated.
[13394.06s -> 13400.46s]  Might as well just rest.
[13400.46s -> 13402.76s]  Holy shit.
[13402.76s -> 13404.76s]  It's time to do some tournaments here.
[13404.76s -> 13411.93s]  Look at these stats.
[13411.93s -> 13415.13s]  205, 142,
[13415.13s -> 13417.94s]  149.
[13417.94s -> 13419.94s]  I think it's time.
[13419.94s -> 13424.94s]  Let's get some tournaments going here.
[13427.37s -> 13429.74s]  Here, have a mango.
[13429.74s -> 13438.68s]  Did you like it?
[13438.68s -> 13440.68s]  I don't want to be weird here, but
[13440.68s -> 13442.68s]  what is on the stomach?
[13442.68s -> 13454.14s]  What is that?
[13454.14s -> 13458.42s]  It's an ear.
[13458.42s -> 13460.42s]  Not yet. Hold on. You're not hungry.
[13460.42s -> 13462.42s]  You are very hungry and very tired.
[13464.42s -> 13466.60s]  Eat a potato.
[13466.60s -> 13473.77s]  Happy? Good.
[13473.77s -> 13476.20s]  Now you, on the other hand,
[13476.20s -> 13482.60s]  you're doing all right. You're just resting.
[13482.60s -> 13484.60s]  God, I can't wait to see you
[13484.60s -> 13487.03s]  in some fan fiction
[13487.03s -> 13491.83s]  OC somewhere.
[13491.83s -> 13493.83s]  Sorry, I meant to say every fan fiction OC.
[13493.83s -> 13497.16s]  I have to correct myself here.
[13497.16s -> 13500.68s]  All right, I think we can go.
[13500.68s -> 13502.68s]  Let me open up the schedule to see.
[13510.04s -> 13512.04s]  All right. Next week, let's plan out
[13512.04s -> 13514.04s]  some competitions for the three of them.
[13514.04s -> 13516.54s]  Calendar.
[13518.71s -> 13520.71s]  So, Rumor is able to
[13520.71s -> 13522.71s]  join this one. This is just a
[13522.71s -> 13524.71s]  snow cup. 1500 bucks.
[13524.71s -> 13526.71s]  Let's sign you up for this one.
[13526.71s -> 13528.71s]  Get your tip-top shape for it.
[13528.71s -> 13531.27s]  And then down here.
[13533.27s -> 13536.34s]  Can they fight each other?
[13540.42s -> 13542.42s]  Only one? Okay, Wally will do this one.
[13542.42s -> 13544.42s]  That's next week.
[13544.42s -> 13546.42s]  And then
[13546.42s -> 13549.94s]  Roberto
[13549.94s -> 13553.53s]  kind of can't do much.
[13553.53s -> 13555.53s]  There's already one
[13555.53s -> 13557.53s]  going on here.
[13560.22s -> 13562.22s]  He'll do the first one on this week,
[13562.22s -> 13564.22s]  Roberto. Another competition.
[13564.22s -> 13566.22s]  Oh no, that's the same one.
[13566.22s -> 13568.22s]  This is January, so February
[13568.22s -> 13570.22s]  you'll do this one.
[13570.22s -> 13576.22s]  All right.
[13576.22s -> 13578.22s]  This bed is so comfy right now.
[13578.22s -> 13580.22s]  I'm glad you're having a good comfy
[13580.22s -> 13583.80s]  rest.
[13583.80s -> 13585.80s]  Speaking of rest.
[13585.80s -> 13587.80s]  Let me take a look at the schedule here.
[13587.80s -> 13590.30s]  Tomorrow, Wally has a tournament.
[13590.30s -> 13594.52s]  How are you doing, Wally? You're doing fine.
[13594.52s -> 13596.52s]  Wally can do
[13596.52s -> 13598.52s]  whatever he wants to do here. Meditation.
[13598.52s -> 13600.76s]  And then Vroomer has
[13600.76s -> 13603.58s]  Vroomer, you need to rest.
[13603.58s -> 13606.46s]  Because you're very tired.
[13606.46s -> 13609.59s]  And you can do the trampoline tomorrow.
[13609.59s -> 13612.92s]  So rest.
[13612.92s -> 13614.92s]  And then you, it doesn't really matter.
[13614.92s -> 13617.61s]  All right, let's do it.
[13619.61s -> 13623.64s]  Vroomer looks really, yeah, Vroomer's
[13623.64s -> 13632.15s]  going to rest today.
[13632.15s -> 13634.15s]  There we go.
[13634.15s -> 13637.10s]  He's doing okay.
[13637.10s -> 13639.66s]  Get ready for your tournament tomorrow.
[13639.66s -> 13641.66s]  And no, you have the tournament tomorrow.
[13641.66s -> 13644.22s]  You're good. How are you doing over here?
[13644.22s -> 13651.32s]  You're always hungry.
[13653.32s -> 13656.01s]  Beef?
[13656.01s -> 13658.01s]  All right, will you like me if you do robot
[13658.01s -> 13660.01s]  animals eat beef?
[13660.01s -> 13663.34s]  Yeah, he liked it. Good. He loved it.
[13663.34s -> 13666.98s]  Now he's happy. Now he's lively. Good.
[13666.98s -> 13670.50s]  So now it's time
[13670.50s -> 13674.92s]  to proceed.
[13674.92s -> 13676.92s]  And it's a competition
[13676.92s -> 13679.35s]  tomorrow.
[13679.35s -> 13681.35s]  Right, yeah, tomorrow it is Wally.
[13681.35s -> 13685.94s]  Here we go.
[13687.94s -> 13693.43s]  Wally is lively.
[13693.43s -> 13695.43s]  He needs maybe a little bit of food.
[13695.43s -> 13697.86s]  Do you think you need food?
[13697.86s -> 13699.86s]  Do you need food?
[13699.86s -> 13704.22s]  Schedule for today.
[13704.22s -> 13706.22s]  Meditation for Wally.
[13706.22s -> 13708.22s]  Rest.
[13708.22s -> 13711.10s]  Yeah, you can have two days off.
[13711.10s -> 13713.10s]  And exercise for you.
[13713.10s -> 13715.10s]  And then it's your tournament tonight.
[13715.10s -> 13717.10s]  We'll feed you after this.
[13717.10s -> 13721.56s]  Not bad.
[13721.56s -> 13725.34s]  Not bad.
[13725.34s -> 13731.74s]  Hungry. Let's give you some food.
[13731.74s -> 13733.74s]  I'm kind of running
[13733.74s -> 13735.74s]  out of food.
[13735.74s -> 13737.74s]  He's like my uncle with the food bag.
[13737.74s -> 13742.90s]  Should be good, right?
[13742.90s -> 13744.90s]  Yeah, focused. Not hungry.
[13744.90s -> 13746.90s]  Not that tired.
[13746.90s -> 13749.85s]  What about you?
[13749.85s -> 13753.94s]  You okay?
[13753.94s -> 13763.08s]  You're doing a good job.
[13763.08s -> 13765.08s]  Bacon diaper? What do you mean a bacon diaper?
[13768.66s -> 13770.66s]  Oh, you mean
[13770.66s -> 13772.66s]  that. Like a bacon wrapped
[13772.66s -> 13777.21s]  skull.
[13777.21s -> 13779.21s]  I had no idea what the hell you're talking about.
[13779.21s -> 13784.07s]  Alright, let's see if
[13784.07s -> 13797.45s]  Wally can win a tournament.
[13797.45s -> 13799.45s]  The Christmas Cup. Merry Christmas.
[13799.45s -> 13806.55s]  Let's begin.
[13806.55s -> 13809.37s]  Chara, still
[13809.37s -> 13811.37s]  stuck in the shitty chicken league.
[13811.37s -> 13815.21s]  And then youth K.
[13815.21s -> 13818.09s]  Youth K.
[13818.09s -> 13821.22s]  So this is
[13821.22s -> 13824.04s]  me. Insanely high defense.
[13824.04s -> 13826.04s]  Good intelligence.
[13826.04s -> 13828.04s]  Not bad speed.
[13828.04s -> 13836.81s]  Really fast.
[13836.81s -> 13839.18s]  But terrible at almost every
[13839.18s -> 13841.42s]  single thing that matters.
[13841.42s -> 13845.13s]  It'll be hard to hit.
[13845.13s -> 13853.90s]  Shouldn't be a problem. Let's go.
[13853.90s -> 13856.33s]  What's my title? Oh, this is an awful title.
[13856.33s -> 13858.33s]  Another placeholder title that I forgot to change.
[13858.33s -> 13860.76s]  Creating life.
[13860.76s -> 13869.58s]  Whatever. Alright, Wally.
[13869.58s -> 13872.07s]  Let's go. Bring it on.
[13872.07s -> 13874.07s]  Ooh.
[13874.07s -> 13876.57s]  Right off the bat. Aggressive.
[13876.57s -> 13879.83s]  Party cracker.
[13879.83s -> 13881.83s]  Double party cracker.
[13881.83s -> 13887.90s]  Nope. Alright.
[13887.90s -> 13893.40s]  Dodged it all. I get really, really
[13893.40s -> 13898.39s]  good defense though, even if I get hit.
[13898.39s -> 13901.46s]  Still timid. Still timid.
[13901.46s -> 13904.78s]  Come on.
[13904.78s -> 13907.53s]  Come on. He can't do a
[13907.53s -> 13909.53s]  move either. We both make such a weird position.
[13909.53s -> 13913.94s]  Oh my god.
[13913.94s -> 13916.70s]  Oh my god.
[13916.70s -> 13920.02s]  I have so many guts.
[13920.02s -> 13922.02s]  This is kind of bad right now, Wally.
[13922.02s -> 13925.16s]  What the fuck is going on here? Timid
[13925.16s -> 13927.16s]  like four times in a row?
[13927.16s -> 13929.16s]  I can't even do his basic attack.
[13929.16s -> 13932.10s]  He's blocking everything.
[13932.10s -> 13934.79s]  Hellvana? What is that?
[13934.79s -> 13938.76s]  12% hit chance.
[13938.76s -> 13948.68s]  32%.
[13948.68s -> 13950.68s]  Okay, that makes him even harder to hit.
[13950.68s -> 13952.68s]  Lucky, actually.
[13952.68s -> 13954.68s]  That was a bad display, Wally.
[13954.68s -> 13960.95s]  That's a great dance though.
[13960.95s -> 13967.14s]  Alright, Chara, Youth K.
[13967.14s -> 13969.14s]  Youth K is one of those dogs with the
[13969.14s -> 13972.09s]  one of those dogs with the hats on.
[13972.09s -> 13974.09s]  Alright, Youth K and Wally.
[13974.09s -> 13976.09s]  Let's see.
[13976.09s -> 13979.10s]  Oh my god.
[13979.10s -> 13983.38s]  What the
[13983.38s -> 13989.34s]  hell is this?
[13989.34s -> 13991.34s]  Did you forget to train other things?
[13991.34s -> 13993.34s]  482 intelligence.
[13993.34s -> 13996.09s]  No accuracy.
[13996.09s -> 13998.09s]  No speed. No defense.
[13998.09s -> 14000.09s]  No power. What does your money even move?
[14000.09s -> 14002.09s]  Scratch is the move to look out for.
[14002.09s -> 14007.72s]  Alright.
[14007.72s -> 14015.58s]  We're gonna give it a try.
[14015.58s -> 14023.51s]  RNG just needs one hit.
[14023.51s -> 14026.20s]  Alright. Let's go.
[14026.20s -> 14032.46s]  Let's do it again.
[14032.46s -> 14034.95s]  Oh god, is this it?
[14034.95s -> 14038.22s]  Let's headbang.
[14038.22s -> 14040.90s]  63% chance to hit this.
[14040.90s -> 14042.90s]  You're dead.
[14042.90s -> 14050.90s]  Back to the drawing board with these stats.
[14050.90s -> 14061.72s]  What a dumb character.
[14061.72s -> 14063.72s]  I guess that would work.
[14063.72s -> 14065.72s]  But your hit chance is probably at
[14065.72s -> 14068.02s]  8-9%.
[14068.02s -> 14070.33s]  Always.
[14070.33s -> 14073.91s]  Maybe even worse.
[14073.91s -> 14078.78s]  What's the point of having all that intelligence?
[14078.78s -> 14082.10s]  Can you enable Pog?
[14082.10s -> 14084.10s]  Pogchamp? It already is enabled.
[14084.10s -> 14093.90s]  It's a global emo.
[14093.90s -> 14096.52s]  Alright. First week of January.
[14096.52s -> 14098.52s]  I think it is. Vroomer has a competition
[14098.52s -> 14101.08s]  coming up here, right? Tonight?
[14101.08s -> 14103.08s]  Yes. Vroomer has a competition
[14103.08s -> 14105.70s]  today.
[14105.70s -> 14107.70s]  And you're not that tired.
[14107.70s -> 14109.70s]  So let's see what we got here. Trampoline
[14109.70s -> 14111.70s]  for Vroomer. Get that speed
[14111.70s -> 14115.29s]  increase.
[14115.29s -> 14117.29s]  Are you tired?
[14117.29s -> 14119.29s]  Are you resting today?
[14119.29s -> 14121.29s]  Yes, you should be.
[14121.29s -> 14123.29s]  You're also resting today.
[14123.29s -> 14125.29s]  No, that's...I'm sorry.
[14125.29s -> 14131.48s]  Get back in the training.
[14133.48s -> 14135.72s]  Enable Pog.
[14135.72s -> 14137.72s]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[14137.72s -> 14139.72s]  Enable Pog?
[14139.72s -> 14147.46s]  Pog is a zoomed-in version
[14147.46s -> 14149.46s]  of Pogchamp.
[14149.46s -> 14154.26s]  Oh. Lively, how you doing?
[14154.26s -> 14156.26s]  Where...oh, you're on the trampoline.
[14158.76s -> 14160.76s]  Focus. Let's get some food in you.
[14160.76s -> 14162.76s]  Just a little potato. Just something easy
[14162.76s -> 14164.76s]  so you can crash
[14164.76s -> 14167.13s]  on the competition. First,
[14167.13s -> 14169.30s]  time in D rank for Vroomer.
[14169.30s -> 14179.03s]  D rank, $1,500.
[14179.03s -> 14181.03s]  Let's see who
[14181.03s -> 14186.73s]  the competition is now.
[14186.73s -> 14188.73s]  If you want a better Pogchamp, just use German Venus.
[14188.73s -> 14191.74s]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[14191.74s -> 14198.58s]  Vroomer, Carl,
[14198.58s -> 14200.58s]  Farrell, and Bob.
[14200.58s -> 14204.42s]  This is against Carl.
[14204.42s -> 14208.26s]  High HP,
[14208.26s -> 14211.21s]  but not a threat anywhere
[14211.21s -> 14213.21s]  else besides an intelligence. What are your moves?
[14213.21s -> 14215.21s]  A lot of intelligence moves.
[14215.21s -> 14217.21s]  Shouldn't be a problem, though.
[14217.21s -> 14233.40s]  Just get the Woodlum down.
[14233.40s -> 14238.33s]  Farrell is just one of those plants.
[14238.33s -> 14240.33s]  No, not very much defense. Just go in there.
[14240.33s -> 14243.66s]  Polish.
[14243.66s -> 14247.56s]  Popped it.
[14247.56s -> 14250.70s]  Come down.
[14250.70s -> 14253.58s]  Really? I'm going to back it up a little bit.
[14253.58s -> 14255.58s]  No, no, no, no, don't. That's his intelligence move
[14255.58s -> 14258.84s]  back there. I don't want him to have
[14258.84s -> 14260.84s]  any...no, that's not good.
[14260.84s -> 14263.85s]  25% chance to hit.
[14263.85s -> 14265.85s]  I'm going to stay forward, though,
[14265.85s -> 14267.85s]  because all of his moves are terrible
[14267.85s -> 14269.85s]  besides the ones at range.
[14269.85s -> 14271.85s]  No, stay in.
[14271.85s -> 14275.42s]  Damn.
[14275.42s -> 14277.42s]  Carly, kill him here.
[14277.42s -> 14280.62s]  Oh, this is bad.
[14282.62s -> 14290.47s]  This is bad. I have to hit him with
[14290.47s -> 14292.47s]  something, otherwise he's going to die.
[14292.47s -> 14294.78s]  35% chance to hit.
[14294.78s -> 14296.78s]  He's got a 66% chance to hit. Back it up.
[14299.72s -> 14301.72s]  That Nirvana thing
[14301.72s -> 14303.72s]  is ridiculous.
[14303.72s -> 14308.44s]  No!
[14308.44s -> 14310.44s]  That was kind of a last-ditch effort there.
[14310.44s -> 14313.77s]  Thank God.
[14313.77s -> 14315.77s]  I'll stay in the middle.
[14315.77s -> 14317.77s]  Percentage-wise, where does that put me?
[14317.77s -> 14319.77s]  It's pretty close, actually.
[14319.77s -> 14321.77s]  Uh-oh. Blocked it.
[14321.77s -> 14324.01s]  Block it!
[14324.01s -> 14326.01s]  Yes!
[14326.01s -> 14328.01s]  Getting close.
[14328.01s -> 14331.02s]  Perfect. Again.
[14331.02s -> 14333.02s]  Quick, quick, quick.
[14333.02s -> 14335.83s]  Composed.
[14335.83s -> 14339.48s]  What does that mean, composed?
[14339.48s -> 14343.51s]  Thankfully, I blocked the two dots.
[14343.51s -> 14347.99s]  That would have been bad.
[14347.99s -> 14353.30s]  Faro and Bob.
[14353.30s -> 14355.30s]  Pretty close. Bob wins.
[14355.30s -> 14359.53s]  Alright, Bob.
[14359.53s -> 14363.94s]  Fairly balanced.
[14363.94s -> 14367.66s]  Head throw, head swing, boomerang,
[14367.66s -> 14369.66s]  fat belly, and nasty.
[14369.66s -> 14374.90s]  Fairly balanced character.
[14374.90s -> 14377.53s]  Decent power.
[14377.53s -> 14379.53s]  Decent life. You kind of just spread out
[14379.53s -> 14381.53s]  all over the place, don't you?
[14381.53s -> 14385.94s]  Oh, and he's also nasty.
[14385.94s -> 14396.44s]  It's another one of those weird ducks,
[14396.44s -> 14398.44s]  but this is not a pumpkin. This one is made out of stone.
[14398.44s -> 14403.82s]  Get in there right away.
[14403.82s -> 14405.82s]  He's got nothing close.
[14405.82s -> 14410.28s]  Back it up.
[14410.28s -> 14412.84s]  He has nothing far away here.
[14412.84s -> 14416.55s]  Oh, he just got destroyed.
[14416.55s -> 14418.86s]  Alright, now I'm gonna take it in close.
[14420.86s -> 14423.74s]  That was just...
[14423.74s -> 14427.58s]  Those two moves are really good.
[14427.58s -> 14430.01s]  Unfortunately, the one in the back doesn't have a high percentage,
[14430.01s -> 14432.01s]  but if it hits, it's good.
[14432.01s -> 14441.08s]  It's some easy money.
[14441.08s -> 14443.32s]  I gotta take him out
[14443.32s -> 14447.53s]  to learn new moves.
[14447.53s -> 14450.34s]  And six new fans.
[14450.34s -> 14456.42s]  When do you get to milk your monsters?
[14466.71s -> 14469.46s]  How did I read that one?
[14469.46s -> 14471.46s]  I don't know, because I looked over and it was there.
[14471.46s -> 14476.07s]  That's so fucking stupid.
[14476.07s -> 14479.40s]  Alright, trampoline.
[14479.40s -> 14482.28s]  Okay, let's do some more tournaments
[14482.28s -> 14484.28s]  scheduled out here.
[14484.28s -> 14486.97s]  Can't do this in official one.
[14486.97s -> 14490.10s]  The next one available for
[14490.10s -> 14492.10s]  Rumor is here.
[14494.47s -> 14496.47s]  And then...
[14496.47s -> 14498.47s]  Over here is Roberto.
[14498.47s -> 14500.47s]  And we'll do Wally on this one.
[14500.47s -> 14502.47s]  So this string here...
[14502.47s -> 14504.47s]  February is the
[14504.47s -> 14506.47s]  tournament week, or month.
[14508.47s -> 14510.47s]  We'll do some more
[14510.47s -> 14512.47s]  just resting and training
[14512.47s -> 14515.86s]  in January.
[14515.86s -> 14520.73s]  Alright, how tired is everybody?
[14520.73s -> 14522.73s]  Everyone's pretty good, actually.
[14522.73s -> 14525.48s]  Begin!
[14525.48s -> 14532.26s]  Ten accuracy.
[14532.26s -> 14535.14s]  I have to bring
[14535.14s -> 14537.64s]  at some point here.
[14537.64s -> 14539.64s]  I gotta bring him back to adventure.
[14546.02s -> 14548.02s]  D and E. What babies?
[14548.02s -> 14550.78s]  Not for long.
[14550.78s -> 14552.78s]  He's gonna hit me up at C after the next tournament if I win it.
[14552.78s -> 14556.68s]  Do my parents watch my stream?
[14559.56s -> 14565.13s]  Oh yeah, my mom and dad are both subbed.
[14565.13s -> 14567.13s]  I need to feed. You are always hungry.
[14567.13s -> 14573.53s]  No, not you.
[14573.53s -> 14575.53s]  You're always hungry. Here. No, you don't get that.
[14575.53s -> 14577.53s]  Yes, you do.
[14577.53s -> 14580.41s]  I think he's the only one that wants to eat it.
[14580.41s -> 14586.81s]  Rest up.
[14586.81s -> 14590.78s]  Everyone's kind of tired.
[14590.78s -> 14594.22s]  Good work.
[14594.22s -> 14596.22s]  What do we need to work on here?
[14598.22s -> 14600.22s]  155. He's across the board.
[14600.22s -> 14607.06s]  He's pretty good.
[14607.06s -> 14609.06s]  Accuracy is kind of lacking.
[14609.06s -> 14611.06s]  Accuracy and intelligence.
[14611.06s -> 14613.62s]  Or maybe accuracy and power.
[14613.62s -> 14615.62s]  Accuracy and life.
[14626.94s -> 14628.94s]  Accuracy
[14628.94s -> 14631.30s]  and life is what I want to do.
[14633.30s -> 14641.80s]  Rest here.
[14641.80s -> 14644.42s]  Life?
[14644.42s -> 14646.42s]  It's gonna be close to the tournament though.
[14646.42s -> 14648.73s]  Let's see what happens after that.
[14648.73s -> 14650.73s]  Now you, Rumer,
[14650.73s -> 14653.29s]  what can you do here?
[14653.29s -> 14655.29s]  Rest.
[14655.29s -> 14657.29s]  Yeah, rest and then trampoline.
[14657.29s -> 14659.98s]  Yeah, that's, yeah.
[14659.98s -> 14661.98s]  I'll take the power in trampoline.
[14661.98s -> 14666.07s]  That sounds good.
[14666.07s -> 14676.89s]  Proceed.
[14676.89s -> 14678.89s]  February week two is the first tournament.
[14678.89s -> 14681.64s]  Not that focused.
[14681.64s -> 14687.98s]  Can we throw Roberto into a meat grinder?
[14687.98s -> 14689.98s]  We have, hold on there.
[14689.98s -> 14693.05s]  Wait till he shows himself in battle.
[14693.05s -> 14695.05s]  And then we'll decide that.
[14695.05s -> 14704.46s]  Level nine intelligence for Wally.
[14706.46s -> 14708.46s]  Roberto, not so good.
[14708.46s -> 14714.98s]  Frustrated.
[14714.98s -> 14717.29s]  Hey, you can do better.
[14717.29s -> 14719.59s]  Just relax.
[14719.59s -> 14723.03s]  Roberto's not a waste of space.
[14723.03s -> 14725.03s]  He's just tired.
[14725.03s -> 14727.03s]  And he's gonna rest this week.
[14727.03s -> 14734.18s]  Food you need to eat.
[14734.18s -> 14736.18s]  Have a mango.
[14736.18s -> 14738.49s]  Would you throw a fork into your garbage disposal?
[14738.49s -> 14745.53s]  No.
[14745.53s -> 14747.53s]  I actually, I would not.
[14747.53s -> 14749.83s]  That's a good idea.
[14749.83s -> 14751.83s]  What about a carrot?
[14751.83s -> 14753.83s]  Yeah, have a carrot.
[14753.83s -> 14755.83s]  You're gonna like this.
[14755.83s -> 14757.83s]  You won a good tournament.
[14757.83s -> 14759.83s]  You deserve it.
[14759.83s -> 14764.31s]  I'm running out of food.
[14764.31s -> 14766.31s]  I have to buy food.
[14766.31s -> 14768.31s]  He's focused for his tournament.
[14768.31s -> 14781.18s]  Yeah.
[14781.18s -> 14783.18s]  Two more weeks.
[14783.18s -> 14785.18s]  The way we raise Vroomer from this point on
[14785.18s -> 14787.18s]  will determine the difference between victory and defeat.
[14787.18s -> 14794.84s]  What does that mean?
[14794.84s -> 14797.85s]  Does he look sadder than usual? He looks sad today.
[14797.85s -> 14800.41s]  I don't know why.
[14800.41s -> 14806.47s]  Anyone catching that?
[14806.47s -> 14808.47s]  He's gonna do the trampoline.
[14808.47s -> 14810.47s]  Trampoline and then rest.
[14810.47s -> 14812.90s]  And then you can do exercise.
[14812.90s -> 14814.90s]  The tournament is here.
[14814.90s -> 14816.90s]  Now trampoline.
[14816.90s -> 14818.90s]  Exercise.
[14818.90s -> 14820.90s]  Rest.
[14820.90s -> 14822.90s]  Yeah, that looks good.
[14822.90s -> 14824.90s]  You have the tournament here.
[14824.90s -> 14826.90s]  So we're gonna do, yep.
[14826.90s -> 14828.90s]  Now there you go.
[14828.90s -> 14830.90s]  Target.
[14830.90s -> 14832.90s]  Rest.
[14832.90s -> 14834.90s]  No, we need a resting now.
[14834.90s -> 14836.90s]  Rest.
[14836.90s -> 14838.90s]  And then power.
[14838.90s -> 14840.90s]  And we'll have to see because you're really tired.
[14840.90s -> 14842.90s]  So you can rest.
[14842.90s -> 14844.90s]  Go for it.
[14844.90s -> 14851.18s]  Alright, pretty successful day.
[14851.18s -> 14857.64s]  Freeze him before he dies so he can live forever.
[14857.64s -> 14859.64s]  Yeah, I'm gonna use his body for another DNA.
[14859.64s -> 14861.64s]  Good work.
[14861.64s -> 14864.39s]  I don't have any food for you, but I'll say good job.
[14864.39s -> 14866.39s]  Yeah, Wally's doing a really good job training.
[14866.39s -> 14868.39s]  A lot of like plus eight, plus nine.
[14868.39s -> 14872.15s]  Very lively.
[14872.15s -> 14874.15s]  Okay, so now.
[14874.15s -> 14876.46s]  Very good job.
[14876.46s -> 14883.74s]  You too.
[14883.74s -> 14885.74s]  And you are just doing okay.
[14885.74s -> 14887.74s]  But you're also just really good at training.
[14887.74s -> 14889.74s]  And you're also just really good at training.
[14889.74s -> 14898.74s]  And you're also just really good at training.
[14898.74s -> 14900.74s]  Okay.
[14900.74s -> 14903.37s]  But you're also just resting, so.
[14903.37s -> 14905.37s]  What about food?
[14905.37s -> 14907.37s]  I gotta give you something before the tournament.
[14907.37s -> 14911.59s]  You like squid?
[14911.59s -> 14917.35s]  Yeah, you do.
[14917.35s -> 14919.35s]  Glad the heavy dialogue is gone.
[14919.35s -> 14921.35s]  It makes the game much more enjoyable.
[14921.35s -> 14923.85s]  Yeah.
[14923.85s -> 14925.85s]  It kinda just had to get us here though.
[14925.85s -> 14928.60s]  That like first 45 minutes of just kind of
[14928.60s -> 14930.60s]  TV show talking.
[14930.60s -> 14932.60s]  And look at the sacred tree.
[14932.60s -> 14936.44s]  I don't even remember that thing's name.
[14936.44s -> 14938.44s]  Oh yeah, save the game.
[14941.96s -> 14950.14s]  Have to do it from like the other menu.
[14950.14s -> 14953.91s]  Alright.
[14953.91s -> 14956.60s]  February, week one.
[14956.60s -> 14958.60s]  Hello, how are things? Need anything today?
[14958.60s -> 14961.29s]  Go ahead, take a look around.
[14961.29s -> 14963.29s]  Alright.
[14963.29s -> 14966.94s]  What can I buy? Training.
[14966.94s -> 14968.94s]  Sandbag, better sandbag.
[14968.94s -> 14970.94s]  I got lots of money, so.
[14970.94s -> 14972.94s]  The life blade.
[14972.94s -> 14976.01s]  That's the thing.
[14976.01s -> 14986.89s]  One by one, let's get this.
[14986.89s -> 14988.89s]  Life blade.
[14988.89s -> 14990.89s]  Put it right here, perfect fit.
[14995.30s -> 14997.74s]  That's the thing he made, right?
[14999.74s -> 15002.04s]  Probably, sandbag is, yeah.
[15002.04s -> 15004.04s]  I'm gonna need this.
[15008.31s -> 15010.74s]  Sandbag is
[15010.74s -> 15012.74s]  perfect fit right here.
[15012.74s -> 15014.74s]  And I can do one more here.
[15014.74s -> 15016.74s]  Whatever it's gonna be.
[15016.74s -> 15023.40s]  This one is book, target,
[15023.40s -> 15025.40s]  trampoline, tub.
[15025.40s -> 15027.40s]  I feel like I want the tub.
[15037.67s -> 15040.23s]  Tub.
[15042.60s -> 15046.12s]  Anything else that's it?
[15046.12s -> 15049.45s]  So what is a praise?
[15049.45s -> 15051.45s]  I had a praise one, but you don't have
[15051.45s -> 15053.45s]  a stone tablet. Alright, okay.
[15053.45s -> 15055.45s]  Sell, buy, end.
[15058.58s -> 15060.58s]  What will you do? I will end.
[15060.58s -> 15068.01s]  Yes. So now today,
[15068.01s -> 15071.14s]  it is
[15071.14s -> 15073.14s]  Roberto's tournament.
[15073.14s -> 15075.14s]  He's gonna rest today, because he's already
[15075.14s -> 15077.14s]  still tired. Why are you still
[15077.14s -> 15080.15s]  tired? But here's the thing now,
[15080.15s -> 15082.15s]  so balance.
[15082.15s -> 15084.15s]  I can change this to
[15084.15s -> 15086.15s]  the life blade.
[15090.95s -> 15095.75s]  Exercise can
[15095.75s -> 15097.75s]  be changed
[15097.75s -> 15099.75s]  to the sandbag.
[15099.75s -> 15102.38s]  Exercise can be changed to sandbag.
[15102.38s -> 15104.38s]  I know, yeah, yeah.
[15104.38s -> 15106.38s]  You need it more than he does.
[15110.38s -> 15112.38s]  You know what?
[15112.38s -> 15114.38s]  Let's do like,
[15114.38s -> 15116.38s]  you do the life blade.
[15118.38s -> 15120.38s]  Let's see what happens.
[15120.38s -> 15124.60s]  Plus ten, nice.
[15124.60s -> 15129.02s]  I needed that actually pretty bad.
[15129.02s -> 15131.32s]  Roberto, plus seven.
[15131.32s -> 15133.32s]  This is shake weight.
[15133.32s -> 15137.29s]  This is shake weight.
[15137.29s -> 15143.75s]  Looks like he's stuck
[15143.75s -> 15145.75s]  in an animation or something. Like he's glitching through the wall.
[15145.75s -> 15150.17s]  And then there's the sandbag.
[15150.17s -> 15154.65s]  He's out of control.
[15154.65s -> 15160.65s]  Alright.
[15160.65s -> 15162.65s]  I need food.
[15162.65s -> 15164.65s]  I'm running out of food. Eat a banana.
[15164.65s -> 15168.23s]  I'm gonna have to go to town and buy some stuff.
[15168.23s -> 15176.30s]  You're fine.
[15176.30s -> 15179.62s]  Alright, that's it.
[15179.62s -> 15182.94s]  Which money do I have?
[15190.15s -> 15192.15s]  Hold on, let me just swallow this banana.
[15192.15s -> 15195.80s]  Shrine, association, item shop.
[15195.80s -> 15198.17s]  Oh, welcome.
[15198.17s -> 15200.54s]  Well, what will you do?
[15200.54s -> 15202.54s]  I will buy.
[15202.54s -> 15204.54s]  Which will you buy?
[15204.54s -> 15207.35s]  I will buy
[15207.35s -> 15209.35s]  mushroom. The common mushroom
[15209.35s -> 15211.35s]  is cheap but it's not very filling or tasty.
[15211.35s -> 15213.78s]  Cheap and filling
[15213.78s -> 15215.78s]  so it's a breeder standard.
[15215.78s -> 15219.30s]  Let's get a few of these.
[15219.30s -> 15221.30s]  This is the one you want to buy, right?
[15221.30s -> 15223.30s]  Can I increase the...
[15223.30s -> 15225.30s]  I will take five potatoes.
[15225.30s -> 15231.32s]  I will also
[15231.32s -> 15233.32s]  hit energy bar. Like a cookie, it
[15233.32s -> 15235.32s]  charges up your monster fast.
[15235.32s -> 15237.32s]  I feel like I want
[15237.32s -> 15239.32s]  like a couple of these.
[15239.32s -> 15241.69s]  Just in case.
[15241.69s -> 15243.69s]  And then maybe a couple of bananas.
[15243.69s -> 15246.25s]  Three bananas.
[15246.25s -> 15248.25s]  Yeah.
[15248.25s -> 15252.02s]  And then yarn ball
[15252.02s -> 15254.02s]  junk toy.
[15254.02s -> 15257.10s]  Pretty old. I found this, didn't I?
[15257.10s -> 15259.85s]  It's like great as a toy. How do I do this?
[15259.85s -> 15262.86s]  How do I use this?
[15262.86s -> 15264.86s]  It will be five hundred bucks
[15264.86s -> 15267.67s]  for beef.
[15267.67s -> 15269.67s]  That's too much. I'm going to have to eat potatoes.
[15269.67s -> 15271.67s]  I'll get like a couple of electric potatoes.
[15271.67s -> 15274.87s]  This four games, there's actually
[15274.87s -> 15276.87s]  five games.
[15276.87s -> 15278.87s]  There's one after this too. But apparently the one
[15278.87s -> 15280.87s]  after this is
[15280.87s -> 15283.69s]  awful.
[15283.69s -> 15285.69s]  Is what I've heard.
[15285.69s -> 15290.94s]  I've heard Evo is a
[15290.94s -> 15292.94s]  unbearable...wow.
[15292.94s -> 15295.24s]  That's fifteen hundred bucks.
[15295.24s -> 15299.46s]  That's wrong? I mean
[15299.46s -> 15301.46s]  everybody told me Evo was terrible.
[15301.46s -> 15304.60s]  I heard it was not good.
[15304.60s -> 15306.60s]  Doesn't it have like a forty five on Metacredit
[15306.60s -> 15309.29s]  or something? Wow.
[15309.29s -> 15311.29s]  Wow.
[15311.29s -> 15313.29s]  Battle cards? Should I just sell
[15313.29s -> 15318.34s]  this? The DS ones are good.
[15318.34s -> 15321.80s]  Maybe I'll try those eventually.
[15321.80s -> 15323.80s]  Can I use the perfume for any reason besides just to sell it?
[15323.80s -> 15325.80s]  I mean the cards, what am I going to
[15325.80s -> 15330.60s]  play? Cards together?
[15330.60s -> 15332.60s]  Just sell it.
[15332.60s -> 15339.24s]  The Game Boy ones are good.
[15339.24s -> 15342.82s]  Which one's the best?
[15342.82s -> 15344.82s]  I think Monster Rancher 2 is the best one.
[15344.82s -> 15350.01s]  But this one's not bad.
[15350.01s -> 15352.01s]  This one's actually growing on me here.
[15352.01s -> 15363.40s]  Most fans agree it's 2 or the second one for DS.
[15363.40s -> 15365.40s]  I could see it.
[15365.40s -> 15367.70s]  2 just was very straightforward but it was fun.
[15367.70s -> 15369.70s]  It was very basic but
[15369.70s -> 15371.70s]  that's why it was so good.
[15371.70s -> 15374.14s]  It seems like every other game they've tried to add
[15374.14s -> 15376.14s]  a bunch of weird shit that nobody really wanted.
[15376.14s -> 15378.14s]  They just want to breed monsters
[15378.14s -> 15380.14s]  and fight monsters.
[15380.14s -> 15382.89s]  But this one is
[15382.89s -> 15384.89s]  I don't hate this one.
[15384.89s -> 15386.89s]  This one's actually really fun.
[15386.89s -> 15393.42s]  I don't mind this one.
[15393.42s -> 15395.42s]  Are we talking about Sekiro?
[15395.42s -> 15397.42s]  Yeah I completed Sekiro
[15397.42s -> 15399.42s]  on the last stream.
[15399.42s -> 15402.55s]  If you didn't catch the last couple streams
[15402.55s -> 15404.55s]  it was Sekiro. Actually the last 5 streams
[15404.55s -> 15407.56s]  in a row were Sekiro.
[15407.56s -> 15409.56s]  So it's time for the tournament.
[15409.56s -> 15411.56s]  You're just doing okay. That's not good.
[15411.56s -> 15415.06s]  It was easy.
[15415.06s -> 15417.06s]  No it was not.
[15417.06s -> 15419.62s]  Not even the slightest.
[15419.62s -> 15422.06s]  You're going to rest right now anyway.
[15422.06s -> 15424.06s]  So that's fine.
[15424.06s -> 15426.06s]  And then we'll see what you can do in battle.
[15426.06s -> 15428.06s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[15428.06s -> 15430.06s]  So now you, Lifeblade and Sandbag.
[15430.06s -> 15433.82s]  And then it's time to bring
[15433.82s -> 15435.82s]  Roberto into a...
[15435.82s -> 15437.82s]  That's so cute. I can't wait to go look at that.
[15437.82s -> 15445.67s]  Look at this.
[15445.67s -> 15447.67s]  Is that in his mouth or in his hands?
[15447.67s -> 15453.11s]  He's jiggling the thing around.
[15453.11s -> 15455.11s]  Oh he's getting tired.
[15455.11s -> 15458.76s]  Too much work.
[15458.76s -> 15463.18s]  What should I do again? I'm trying.
[15463.18s -> 15468.47s]  You're fine.
[15468.47s -> 15471.16s]  Eat a potato. Feel better.
[15480.92s -> 15482.92s]  He's praying out of bonfire.
[15482.92s -> 15487.77s]  How you doing?
[15487.77s -> 15489.77s]  Mr. Cheese Wheel. Are you good?
[15489.77s -> 15491.77s]  Tired. Oh boy.
[15491.77s -> 15496.82s]  Did I overwork you?
[15496.82s -> 15499.13s]  You look like Cherry.
[15499.13s -> 15501.50s]  From Pee Wee's Playhouse.
[15501.50s -> 15510.62s]  Come on. You can do it.
[15510.62s -> 15517.59s]  You can do it.
[15517.59s -> 15519.59s]  See? That's all he needed.
[15519.59s -> 15524.07s]  Some encouragement.
[15524.07s -> 15526.07s]  So you're very lively and you're focused.
[15526.07s -> 15528.07s]  You on the other hand, you're using food.
[15530.07s -> 15543.13s]  You can just have a potato.
[15543.13s -> 15545.13s]  Let's see if I can steamroll this competition.
[15548.39s -> 15555.56s]  It makes it really hard
[15555.56s -> 15557.56s]  to juggle three monsters, four monsters at the same time.
[15557.56s -> 15566.97s]  Before it was you just had
[15566.97s -> 15568.97s]  one monster and you worked
[15568.97s -> 15571.34s]  the hell out of them.
[15571.34s -> 15581.51s]  Now you've got a whole family.
[15581.51s -> 15583.51s]  Remember Gaddy.
[15583.51s -> 15585.51s]  Has Gaddy improved at all?
[15585.51s -> 15587.75s]  Let's find out. Not at all.
[15587.75s -> 15593.62s]  Gaddy has not even
[15593.62s -> 15604.57s]  trained one step.
[15604.57s -> 15606.57s]  That's fine. You can go against my Smurf.
[15606.57s -> 15617.24s]  That's a lot of damage.
[15617.24s -> 15619.80s]  Followed up with a kick.
[15619.80s -> 15628.25s]  You may as well just have that be
[15628.25s -> 15630.25s]  somebody's dog now. You know what I mean?
[15630.25s -> 15633.32s]  Why are you fighting here?
[15633.32s -> 15635.32s]  That should be like a lap dog
[15635.32s -> 15637.32s]  just sitting on somebody's
[15637.32s -> 15639.32s]  stomach while they're lying down on the couch.
[15639.32s -> 15648.07s]  What is that dog doing here?
[15648.07s -> 15650.07s]  That should be somebody's just friend.
[15650.07s -> 15652.07s]  Why are they here?
[15652.07s -> 15654.07s]  You're fighting like a giant robot with a sword
[15654.07s -> 15661.18s]  in his hand. See?
[15661.18s -> 15669.16s]  Come on. Alias.
[15669.16s -> 15671.16s]  164 in accuracy. That's pretty good.
[15671.16s -> 15673.72s]  It's not going to be enough.
[15673.72s -> 15688.50s]  We come from a similar
[15688.50s -> 15692.66s]  breed.
[15696.42s -> 15698.73s]  Nice dodge.
[15698.73s -> 15708.44s]  Fine.
[15708.44s -> 15714.39s]  Do it again.
[15714.39s -> 15720.71s]  What's the defense on the bird dog?
[15720.71s -> 15722.71s]  That's good.
[15722.71s -> 15727.26s]  It can't be that good.
[15727.26s -> 15732.12s]  There we go. See what?
[15732.12s -> 15741.40s]  Demon doll.
[15741.40s -> 15745.56s]  Gaddy actually won a fight.
[15745.56s -> 15747.56s]  Shocking.
[15747.56s -> 15749.56s]  We fought Kylan before.
[15749.56s -> 15751.56s]  Just fast.
[15751.56s -> 15753.56s]  And has good accuracy.
[15753.56s -> 15762.06s]  Losing to Gaddy.
[15762.06s -> 15767.56s]  What an embarrassment.
[15767.56s -> 15770.70s]  Double charge. Do it again.
[15770.70s -> 15772.94s]  Or kick it.
[15772.94s -> 15776.33s]  That's it.
[15776.33s -> 15778.33s]  Final guts.
[15778.33s -> 15788.55s]  This doesn't feel right.
[15788.55s -> 15793.93s]  I think he's ready. Roberto.
[15793.93s -> 15804.15s]  That was BM.
[15804.15s -> 15806.15s]  800 bucks 7 fame.
[15806.15s -> 15815.43s]  You guys wanted to retire him.
[15815.43s -> 15819.59s]  I wonder how long they live in this one.
[15819.59s -> 15824.97s]  Actually, it's time to go pee.
[15824.97s -> 15827.34s]  It's probably going to be the final pee of the night.
[15827.34s -> 15829.70s]  I'll be right back.
[15970.54s -> 15996.50s]  Alright. So where are we now?
[15996.50s -> 16001.18s]  Vroomer has a tournament today.
[16003.18s -> 16005.18s]  Wally has tournament 2.
[16005.18s -> 16008.63s]  This is class D.
[16008.63s -> 16010.63s]  And then...
[16010.63s -> 16012.63s]  One more of these and we can move to C.
[16012.63s -> 16017.62s]  So I don't...
[16017.62s -> 16019.62s]  I want you to rest right now.
[16019.62s -> 16022.44s]  Rest.
[16022.44s -> 16025.26s]  And then when you...
[16025.26s -> 16030.57s]  Get in the tub.
[16030.57s -> 16032.94s]  And you...
[16032.94s -> 16034.94s]  What was he doing before?
[16034.94s -> 16037.24s]  Balance, right?
[16037.24s -> 16039.24s]  Lifeblade.
[16039.24s -> 16041.24s]  Use the new things we bought.
[16041.24s -> 16043.24s]  Bad.
[16043.24s -> 16045.93s]  Really bad.
[16045.93s -> 16052.78s]  6 only? Come on.
[16052.78s -> 16055.91s]  You're in the tub now.
[16055.91s -> 16057.91s]  I mean, it's absolutely adorable, but...
[16057.91s -> 16064.57s]  I'm going to get 6 points.
[16064.57s -> 16067.00s]  How is this improving defense?
[16067.00s -> 16073.46s]  I guess he's running out of the way.
[16073.46s -> 16076.34s]  We haven't seen him do this yet.
[16076.34s -> 16079.86s]  What a weird way to increase your defense.
[16079.86s -> 16085.82s]  What a weird way to increase your HP.
[16085.82s -> 16087.82s]  Alright. You... I'm sorry, but come on.
[16087.82s -> 16091.40s]  You can do better than that.
[16091.40s -> 16095.69s]  I know you can.
[16095.69s -> 16103.82s]  You too.
[16103.82s -> 16105.82s]  They can do better than that.
[16105.82s -> 16107.82s]  I know they can.
[16107.82s -> 16110.82s]  You're just resting.
[16110.82s -> 16112.82s]  So you have a tournament.
[16112.82s -> 16114.82s]  Let's give you the potato.
[16114.82s -> 16116.82s]  There's something with starch in it.
[16116.82s -> 16122.65s]  So you can get some carbs.
[16122.65s -> 16124.65s]  How do you increase your HP?
[16124.65s -> 16126.65s]  You don't.
[16126.65s -> 16128.65s]  It gradually reduces from the second that you're born.
[16128.65s -> 16131.53s]  It starts at 100.
[16131.53s -> 16142.09s]  I mean, you can slow the damage over time.
[16142.09s -> 16144.09s]  You know, if you eat carrots and shit.
[16144.09s -> 16147.10s]  But eventually it goes to zero.
[16147.10s -> 16165.08s]  How can I decrease my HP?
[16165.08s -> 16167.08s]  I'm not going to answer that question.
[16167.08s -> 16169.08s]  I'm not going to answer that question.
[16169.08s -> 16177.46s]  I'm not going to answer that question.
[16177.46s -> 16179.46s]  Okay, this is the next class D.
[16179.46s -> 16182.60s]  Okay, this is the next class D.
[16182.60s -> 16187.72s]  Carl, Mary, and Nat.
[16187.72s -> 16189.72s]  Carl, Mary, and Nat.
[16189.72s -> 16191.72s]  Carl, Mary, and Nat.
[16191.72s -> 16193.72s]  Rumer versus Nat.
[16193.72s -> 16197.75s]  None of the physical moves are dangerous.
[16197.75s -> 16199.75s]  None of the physical moves are dangerous.
[16199.75s -> 16201.75s]  Pretty slow, but has fairly decent IQ moves.
[16201.75s -> 16203.75s]  Pretty slow, but has fairly decent IQ moves.
[16203.75s -> 16205.75s]  Thunder and attack.
[16205.75s -> 16208.12s]  Look out for thunder.
[16208.12s -> 16212.73s]  Their traits are super weapon.
[16212.73s -> 16226.17s]  What the hell does that mean?
[16226.17s -> 16231.16s]  Why can't we get one of these weirdos?
[16231.16s -> 16234.73s]  Why can't we get one of these weirdos?
[16234.73s -> 16236.73s]  It's far away.
[16236.73s -> 16238.73s]  Get in close.
[16238.73s -> 16241.10s]  Any of the moves that they can do from far away.
[16241.10s -> 16245.13s]  Get in close. Any of the moves that they can do from far away.
[16245.13s -> 16247.13s]  Don't even let them do it.
[16247.13s -> 16249.88s]  It's two shot.
[16249.88s -> 16251.88s]  That was a lot of damage.
[16251.88s -> 16255.34s]  That was a lot of damage.
[16255.34s -> 16258.09s]  I might get this character to like C or B tonight.
[16258.09s -> 16260.09s]  I might get this character to like C or B tonight.
[16260.09s -> 16262.09s]  Remember how long it took us to get from D to C,
[16262.09s -> 16264.09s]  Remember how long it took us to get from D to C,
[16264.09s -> 16269.58s]  C to B in Monster Ration 2?
[16269.58s -> 16278.15s]  C to B in Monster Ration 2?
[16278.15s -> 16281.29s]  It was hard.
[16281.29s -> 16283.59s]  There's a chance.
[16283.59s -> 16286.09s]  Mary sucks.
[16286.09s -> 16288.84s]  C to B is...
[16288.84s -> 16304.33s]  Watch out for the magic.
[16304.33s -> 16308.23s]  It's a pretty cool toad though.
[16308.23s -> 16310.23s]  We had a toad before.
[16318.60s -> 16322.25s]  That hurts so much.
[16322.25s -> 16324.25s]  Let's do another two shot.
[16324.25s -> 16326.25s]  Goodbye.
[16326.25s -> 16329.19s]  Aww.
[16329.19s -> 16334.89s]  Toothpaste toad?
[16334.89s -> 16336.89s]  Don't talk shit. It's really easy to lose.
[16336.89s -> 16344.10s]  I only have 150 health.
[16344.10s -> 16348.14s]  Oh god.
[16348.14s -> 16350.14s]  I talked shit and it's going to come back and haunt me.
[16350.14s -> 16352.14s]  I have to do this move.
[16352.14s -> 16354.14s]  I have to get a long shot here and end it.
[16354.14s -> 16359.19s]  Oh, he's bullish.
[16359.19s -> 16365.91s]  Oh no, this is it.
[16365.91s -> 16369.37s]  Oh no.
[16369.37s -> 16371.67s]  I talked a lot of shit there.
[16371.67s -> 16373.67s]  It's okay, I can still win. Carl has to lose.
[16373.67s -> 16382.30s]  I have to beat Carl right now.
[16382.30s -> 16386.58s]  200 health.
[16386.58s -> 16390.22s]  Nothing else though.
[16390.22s -> 16392.22s]  Just high HP.
[16392.22s -> 16404.30s]  Damn it.
[16404.30s -> 16406.66s]  Well, I had to lose once.
[16406.66s -> 16408.84s]  Eventually.
[16408.84s -> 16412.94s]  Alright, Carl.
[16412.94s -> 16416.90s]  What's the percentage here?
[16416.90s -> 16422.22s]  52?
[16422.22s -> 16424.22s]  Alright, good, good.
[16424.22s -> 16426.22s]  Just beat him.
[16426.22s -> 16430.76s]  Go back a little.
[16430.76s -> 16432.76s]  50%.
[16432.76s -> 16439.10s]  Stay back.
[16439.10s -> 16441.10s]  44%.
[16441.10s -> 16445.45s]  Accuracy is the big deal here.
[16445.45s -> 16447.45s]  Look at this. This is bad.
[16447.45s -> 16449.94s]  We are working on that.
[16449.94s -> 16451.94s]  Oh fuck you with this final bullshit.
[16451.94s -> 16460.39s]  We found the thing we need to work on.
[16460.39s -> 16464.82s]  Because that's not good.
[16464.82s -> 16467.19s]  My defense is good.
[16467.19s -> 16474.74s]  I'm blocking a lot of hits.
[16474.74s -> 16477.05s]  Accuracy.
[16477.05s -> 16481.40s]  I'm not doing so well.
[16481.40s -> 16483.40s]  49%.
[16483.40s -> 16486.65s]  Okay, good.
[16486.65s -> 16491.00s]  Still a chance to lose.
[16491.00s -> 16493.00s]  Do I have the accuracy upgrade?
[16493.00s -> 16498.12s]  Alright, Carl.
[16498.12s -> 16503.24s]  The winner of this terrific battle is Rumer.
[16503.24s -> 16505.24s]  That's because I beat Carl.
[16505.24s -> 16507.93s]  Nice. Just barely.
[16507.93s -> 16517.40s]  1500 bucks and a squid.
[16517.40s -> 16522.01s]  We have to get you into accuracy training.
[16522.01s -> 16524.01s]  Right now.
[16524.01s -> 16534.57s]  Good work, but still.
[16534.57s -> 16537.19s]  You gotta win one more of those.
[16537.19s -> 16540.14s]  Let me see you here.
[16540.14s -> 16542.14s]  Accuracy is really at 159.
[16542.14s -> 16544.44s]  It's really not anything that bad.
[16544.44s -> 16547.38s]  Needs to be higher.
[16547.38s -> 16552.12s]  Being at less than 50% sucks.
[16552.12s -> 16555.58s]  I guess it also depends on their speed too.
[16555.58s -> 16559.16s]  His health is terrible.
[16559.16s -> 16561.16s]  Accuracy and health. His defense is terrible too.
[16561.16s -> 16568.58s]  I'll do accuracy and health.
[16568.58s -> 16571.53s]  For now.
[16571.53s -> 16574.60s]  Rumer.
[16574.60s -> 16576.60s]  I need to win one more.
[16576.60s -> 16579.29s]  We'll do this one.
[16579.29s -> 16581.85s]  Because that gives us
[16581.85s -> 16583.85s]  one, two, yeah.
[16583.85s -> 16585.85s]  Okay.
[16585.85s -> 16587.85s]  Let's go to schedule.
[16587.85s -> 16590.02s]  You don't actually have to rest.
[16590.02s -> 16592.02s]  Good.
[16592.02s -> 16594.02s]  Okay.
[16594.02s -> 16596.02s]  Accuracy.
[16596.02s -> 16598.02s]  The life stick.
[16600.02s -> 16604.57s]  Rest here.
[16604.57s -> 16606.57s]  And then maybe
[16606.57s -> 16609.00s]  the life stick again.
[16611.00s -> 16613.00s]  The rest of you know who has
[16613.00s -> 16615.00s]  somebody has something today, right?
[16615.00s -> 16617.56s]  You Wally does.
[16617.56s -> 16619.56s]  Wally is frustrated so
[16619.56s -> 16626.60s]  just rest Wally.
[16626.60s -> 16628.60s]  And then you don't have anything for a while
[16628.60s -> 16630.60s]  but you're still tired so you may as well rest.
[16630.60s -> 16637.83s]  Let's go.
[16637.83s -> 16640.07s]  Much better.
[16640.07s -> 16642.07s]  Much better number.
[16642.07s -> 16647.94s]  Where is Wally?
[16647.94s -> 16651.40s]  Sleeping, right?
[16651.40s -> 16654.79s]  No, have a potato.
[16657.67s -> 16660.10s]  I love these potatoes.
[16660.10s -> 16662.10s]  It's just really easy to get them borrowed.
[16662.10s -> 16666.20s]  Enable Pog.
[16666.20s -> 16670.04s]  Well that means I have to get rid of something.
[16670.04s -> 16676.18s]  What am I going to get rid of?
[16676.18s -> 16678.18s]  I have five slots so I'm not going to get rid of anything.
[16678.18s -> 16680.18s]  I have to get rid of
[16680.18s -> 16682.18s]  FeelsBadMan.
[16682.18s -> 16685.64s]  I'm going to have to get rid of MonkaS.
[16685.64s -> 16687.64s]  I only get five.
[16687.64s -> 16699.22s]  Okay, very lively.
[16699.22s -> 16702.49s]  Yeah, you're good.
[16702.49s -> 16704.49s]  Okay, Wally's good for his tournament.
[16717.48s -> 16730.07s]  The February Cup.
[16730.07s -> 16732.07s]  Chavez, Agassiz,
[16732.07s -> 16734.82s]  and Yuki.
[16734.82s -> 16736.82s]  This is against Yuki.
[16736.82s -> 16741.94s]  Really low defense.
[16741.94s -> 16743.94s]  Not a threat.
[16743.94s -> 16747.26s]  Just do
[16747.26s -> 16749.26s]  just do physical attacks.
[16749.26s -> 16761.67s]  It's a little of these weird duck
[16761.67s -> 16764.55s]  dog hat combinations.
[16764.55s -> 16768.01s]  All right, Wally, show him.
[16768.01s -> 16774.15s]  Show him what you got.
[16774.15s -> 16776.84s]  Wally, what the fuck was that, Wally?
[16776.84s -> 16781.26s]  Wally!
[16781.26s -> 16790.20s]  Wally!
[16790.20s -> 16793.08s]  And now I can't hit him.
[16793.08s -> 16795.08s]  I got to stay in the middle.
[16795.08s -> 16797.08s]  Stay in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, because he has no moves for the mid range.
[16797.08s -> 16800.34s]  Pull him forward.
[16800.34s -> 16804.18s]  And now he's composed.
[16804.18s -> 16809.56s]  This is bad.
[16809.56s -> 16811.56s]  Come on, again, right off the bat. Do it, quick, quick, quick, again, again, again.
[16811.56s -> 16814.57s]  Yes!
[16814.57s -> 16827.69s]  Chavez and Agassiz.
[16827.69s -> 16833.30s]  Chavez win.
[16833.30s -> 16835.30s]  Yuki versus Chavez.
[16835.30s -> 16839.34s]  Not doing so good. Chavez is
[16839.34s -> 16841.77s]  the one to beat here, all right.
[16841.77s -> 16844.46s]  So, Agassiz.
[16844.46s -> 16846.82s]  High intelligence, high speed,
[16846.82s -> 16849.26s]  low defense.
[16849.26s -> 16851.26s]  Stay away from the magic abilities.
[16851.26s -> 16863.99s]  That's pretty much it.
[16863.99s -> 16867.70s]  Some of these cats.
[16867.70s -> 16869.70s]  All right, stay out of mid range, and
[16869.70s -> 16871.70s]  start immediately with the thing I
[16871.70s -> 16874.39s]  blocked.
[16874.39s -> 16876.39s]  High intelligence.
[16876.39s -> 16881.38s]  See what I mean here?
[16881.38s -> 16883.38s]  This is going to be hard.
[16883.38s -> 16885.38s]  38%, fuck me.
[16885.38s -> 16892.66s]  Stay forward.
[16892.66s -> 16899.45s]  There we go.
[16899.45s -> 16903.16s]  I don't have very much power, right?
[16903.16s -> 16907.50s]  I'm really dumb. No!
[16907.50s -> 16909.50s]  I forgot if this defense is so high.
[16909.50s -> 16913.59s]  At least I have a 200 defense.
[16913.59s -> 16922.68s]  Let's end it with the pop.
[16922.68s -> 16925.88s]  Come on, let me be flashy.
[16925.88s -> 16927.88s]  You're not going to let me be flashy?
[16927.88s -> 16931.91s]  22%.
[16931.91s -> 16933.91s]  I still got it.
[16933.91s -> 16944.60s]  Is that Mewtwo?
[16944.60s -> 16949.21s]  It's just a regular Mew.
[16949.21s -> 16952.60s]  All right, Chavez.
[16952.60s -> 16954.97s]  You're the...
[16954.97s -> 16956.97s]  Why are you so good?
[16956.97s -> 16960.36s]  Because you have good defense
[16960.36s -> 16963.30s]  and good power.
[16963.30s -> 16965.30s]  I have to hit you with intelligence stuff.
[16965.30s -> 16969.40s]  Yeah, I'm going to...
[16969.40s -> 16971.40s]  I'm going to try to burn you quick.
[16971.40s -> 16987.26s]  Rock Bunny.
[16987.26s -> 16989.26s]  Gotta go for this. See if I can hit it.
[16989.26s -> 16997.96s]  He sprays a bleed to it.
[16997.96s -> 17003.13s]  No.
[17003.13s -> 17016.04s]  Again.
[17016.04s -> 17025.19s]  That does more, somehow.
[17025.19s -> 17030.50s]  Try again.
[17030.50s -> 17032.81s]  Stay in mid-range.
[17032.81s -> 17034.98s]  Because he doesn't have shit in mid-range.
[17034.98s -> 17036.98s]  I'm going to bounce back and shoot him.
[17036.98s -> 17038.98s]  3, 2, 1, go.
[17038.98s -> 17044.66s]  Not good.
[17044.66s -> 17047.22s]  35% chance.
[17047.22s -> 17050.74s]  I'm going to hold on to my guts and not use it.
[17050.74s -> 17054.07s]  Have to win this one.
[17054.07s -> 17058.04s]  He's trying to bridge...
[17058.04s -> 17063.21s]  No!
[17063.21s -> 17066.09s]  20% chance to hit him.
[17066.09s -> 17068.78s]  Might just have to win this one by
[17068.78s -> 17070.78s]  playing defensively.
[17070.78s -> 17075.58s]  Can't go back any further over the wall.
[17075.58s -> 17084.01s]  Fall back.
[17084.01s -> 17086.82s]  One second left.
[17086.82s -> 17088.82s]  Do not do a move at the last second.
[17088.82s -> 17094.14s]  Judges?
[17094.14s -> 17096.14s]  Who wins?
[17096.14s -> 17101.51s]  I do!
[17101.51s -> 17110.34s]  Full-on victory. I like it.
[17110.34s -> 17112.34s]  Stalling tactics. Sometimes you've got to just
[17112.34s -> 17129.56s]  wear them out.
[17129.56s -> 17134.55s]  Please clap.
[17134.55s -> 17136.55s]  Not yet.
[17136.55s -> 17138.55s]  This is the final
[17138.55s -> 17141.18s]  tournament before I
[17141.18s -> 17143.18s]  can go into Seacup.
[17143.18s -> 17147.46s]  So we've got Lifeblade.
[17147.46s -> 17149.46s]  We should probably do this in the other...
[17149.46s -> 17151.46s]  Yeah. Rest first.
[17151.46s -> 17153.46s]  Do Lifeblade.
[17153.46s -> 17155.46s]  Maybe Lifeblade again.
[17155.46s -> 17157.46s]  This is the day of the tournament.
[17157.46s -> 17159.90s]  So you rest.
[17159.90s -> 17161.90s]  Nobody else has a tournament, right?
[17161.90s -> 17163.90s]  Rest.
[17163.90s -> 17165.90s]  Actually, you don't even need it.
[17165.90s -> 17167.90s]  Just do balance.
[17171.90s -> 17180.26s]  No defense.
[17180.26s -> 17182.26s]  Get in the tub.
[17182.26s -> 17184.26s]  Then you rest here.
[17184.26s -> 17186.57s]  You, on the other hand,
[17186.57s -> 17189.64s]  do the sandbag.
[17189.64s -> 17192.33s]  Get on
[17192.33s -> 17194.33s]  the trampoline
[17194.33s -> 17196.33s]  for speed.
[17196.33s -> 17198.33s]  And then you can rest here.
[17198.33s -> 17203.64s]  You're tired. Go to bed.
[17203.64s -> 17211.58s]  Begin!
[17211.58s -> 17213.58s]  Molly, you're just really not that good
[17213.58s -> 17216.46s]  with training.
[17216.46s -> 17219.34s]  It's just the fact. You're on the level 2
[17219.34s -> 17223.42s]  shit. What is this?
[17223.42s -> 17225.42s]  You were doing so good in the beginning.
[17225.42s -> 17235.13s]  I know you did
[17235.13s -> 17237.13s]  just win a tournament, but still.
[17237.13s -> 17241.10s]  I know you can do better.
[17241.10s -> 17243.10s]  He's trying his best. Yeah, but he's
[17243.10s -> 17245.40s]  been eating
[17245.40s -> 17247.40s]  bananas and shit all day.
[17247.40s -> 17250.02s]  Every day. You're doing just fine.
[17250.02s -> 17252.02s]  I will praise you, because
[17252.02s -> 17256.44s]  you just got 11 points.
[17256.44s -> 17258.44s]  You're a cruel and hateful person.
[17258.44s -> 17260.62s]  No, I'm not. You can't just
[17260.62s -> 17262.62s]  praise him every day. They turn
[17262.62s -> 17264.62s]  to shit. I did that
[17264.62s -> 17266.62s]  to beanbag Sonic, and he went
[17266.62s -> 17268.62s]  all the way to the other side of the scale.
[17268.62s -> 17270.86s]  And eventually he wouldn't even listen to me.
[17270.86s -> 17280.52s]  Remember?
[17280.52s -> 17284.10s]  Here. Here's your favorite thing.
[17284.10s -> 17288.52s]  I just
[17288.52s -> 17290.52s]  talked about how all he does is eat bananas, and I
[17290.52s -> 17293.14s]  just gave him one. That's fine.
[17293.14s -> 17295.14s]  We got a tournament coming up here, right?
[17295.14s -> 17297.70s]  How you doing? You sleeping?
[17297.70s -> 17300.90s]  You need to eat.
[17300.90s -> 17303.66s]  Oh, shit. I can't. Wait a minute. I can't do anything.
[17303.66s -> 17305.66s]  Oh, no.
[17305.66s -> 17308.92s]  That's not good.
[17308.92s -> 17314.42s]  Oh, that's alright.
[17317.24s -> 17323.45s]  Alright, you're good.
[17323.45s -> 17325.45s]  Let's give you some food.
[17325.45s -> 17327.45s]  It's a life blade
[17327.45s -> 17329.45s]  again for you. Life blade again.
[17329.45s -> 17331.45s]  Maybe you should rest.
[17331.45s -> 17333.45s]  Tub, rest.
[17333.45s -> 17335.45s]  Trampoline,
[17335.45s -> 17337.69s]  rest.
[17337.69s -> 17339.69s]  They're all doing just fine.
[17339.69s -> 17342.70s]  Bigot.
[17342.70s -> 17344.70s]  Saved the game. Yeah, I haven't saved the game in about
[17344.70s -> 17348.66s]  four hours. That's actually
[17348.66s -> 17350.66s]  really bad, you're right. That's awful.
[17350.66s -> 17352.66s]  Something bad is gonna happen though.
[17354.66s -> 17357.16s]  How do I even save
[17357.16s -> 17362.92s]  the game? Look how hungry you are.
[17362.92s -> 17364.92s]  Come on, I got you.
[17368.62s -> 17375.26s]  Are you full?
[17375.26s -> 17377.26s]  You're still hungry.
[17377.26s -> 17384.94s]  Here. Did you not literally learn a new
[17384.94s -> 17387.37s]  move? No, not yet. I have to bring them
[17387.37s -> 17389.37s]  into the adventure mode thing.
[17389.37s -> 17391.93s]  For them to learn new moves. I have to
[17391.93s -> 17393.93s]  do that. Okay, after bringing
[17393.93s -> 17396.30s]  um, after getting to rank C,
[17396.30s -> 17398.30s]  I have to get rumors
[17398.30s -> 17401.43s]  of a new move.
[17406.87s -> 17412.25s]  For this one, they made it so you have to push
[17412.25s -> 17414.25s]  reset on the console to save.
[17414.25s -> 17416.49s]  That's really weird.
[17418.49s -> 17422.07s]  Wasn't it somewhere in like
[17422.07s -> 17424.07s]  weekend calendar? Where was it?
[17424.07s -> 17426.07s]  Reader? Book?
[17426.07s -> 17428.07s]  Isn't it like at the very beginning of each week?
[17428.07s -> 17430.70s]  Yeah, it's at the beginning of each week.
[17436.38s -> 17440.66s]  Hey Jerma, got your nose.
[17442.66s -> 17444.66s]  You don't, no you don't.
[17444.66s -> 17446.66s]  It's still on my face.
[17446.66s -> 17448.66s]  I'm not stupid.
[17454.10s -> 17456.10s]  There we go.
[17456.10s -> 17460.07s]  Saving game. Turn on the face cam.
[17460.07s -> 17462.07s]  What if I turn the face cam on and I
[17462.07s -> 17464.07s]  this whole time was having Voldemort
[17464.07s -> 17466.31s]  style makeup put on me.
[17466.31s -> 17468.31s]  And that was just a plant in chat to write that.
[17468.31s -> 17470.31s]  And I just had this flat fucking
[17470.31s -> 17472.31s]  no, nothing there.
[17472.31s -> 17474.68s]  I just start screaming.
[17474.68s -> 17476.68s]  Screaming as loud as I can.
[17476.68s -> 17481.78s]  And then I turn the stream off.
[17481.78s -> 17483.78s]  April fools.
[17483.78s -> 17486.34s]  Alright, here we go.
[17486.34s -> 17488.34s]  You have a tournament today.
[17488.34s -> 17490.34s]  You're kind of tired though.
[17490.34s -> 17493.21s]  Just rest.
[17493.21s -> 17495.21s]  You are, you need to rest.
[17495.21s -> 17497.21s]  You're frustrated that it's okay.
[17497.21s -> 17499.77s]  Everyone's resting today.
[17499.77s -> 17501.77s]  Or just go to bed.
[17501.77s -> 17507.53s]  That would be the greatest thing I've ever seen.
[17507.53s -> 17515.34s]  And have a potato.
[17517.34s -> 17522.90s]  Jerma, please read this. I want to be the one guy.
[17522.90s -> 17528.54s]  Your wish is my command.
[17528.54s -> 17535.45s]  Alright.
[17535.45s -> 17539.03s]  Final tournament.
[17539.03s -> 17541.03s]  Before I can do the
[17541.03s -> 17543.03s]  rank up. Let's hope I win.
[17543.03s -> 17547.32s]  And then
[17547.32s -> 17549.32s]  we're that much closer to C rank. We're in C rank
[17549.32s -> 17551.32s]  after that. Next one.
[17551.32s -> 17562.46s]  Rumor, Fate, Bernard,
[17562.46s -> 17564.46s]  and Garganny.
[17564.46s -> 17567.21s]  Versus Fate.
[17567.21s -> 17571.75s]  Tons of life.
[17571.75s -> 17573.75s]  Not really that much of anything else.
[17573.75s -> 17578.49s]  Just high health, that's all.
[17578.49s -> 17582.39s]  And then I'm gonna take them all
[17582.39s -> 17585.14s]  exploring for the next month.
[17585.14s -> 17594.04s]  Just gotta hit hard.
[17594.04s -> 17597.30s]  Good start.
[17597.30s -> 17600.38s]  Good start. You got nothing in the back.
[17600.38s -> 17602.38s]  54%. Let's give it a try.
[17606.02s -> 17608.78s]  Helicopter. Good luck.
[17608.78s -> 17613.26s]  Look at all my guts.
[17613.26s -> 17615.50s]  He can't even do any moves.
[17615.50s -> 17617.50s]  Did he use everything to try to do that?
[17619.50s -> 17626.41s]  Just kill him.
[17626.41s -> 17634.09s]  I had a nightmare about this thing.
[17634.09s -> 17639.02s]  Hey Jerma, tell a funny joke.
[17639.02s -> 17643.11s]  Nah, I got nothing, sorry.
[17643.11s -> 17645.11s]  Sorry. No jokes tonight.
[17645.11s -> 17649.21s]  Alright Bernard.
[17649.21s -> 17654.71s]  Not that special, just a lot of health.
[17654.71s -> 17659.38s]  The no joke joke.
[17659.38s -> 17662.26s]  That's the one.
[17662.26s -> 17668.92s]  Jerma lied about funny joke.
[17668.92s -> 17670.92s]  That is fucking terrifying.
[17670.92s -> 17673.22s]  It's just a giant mouth.
[17673.22s -> 17682.70s]  That's just Pac-Man.
[17682.70s -> 17684.70s]  That's Pac-Man with dentures in him.
[17684.70s -> 17690.39s]  In the back, that's a good backspin.
[17690.39s -> 17693.96s]  It's been good, but...
[17693.96s -> 17699.14s]  Try again.
[17699.14s -> 17711.43s]  There's two coin flips in a row.
[17711.43s -> 17713.86s]  He doesn't have very many guts.
[17713.86s -> 17715.86s]  Oh man, that's not good. What was his defense at?
[17715.86s -> 17719.00s]  This is gonna come down to the end.
[17719.00s -> 17721.00s]  I have to win this one.
[17721.00s -> 17723.37s]  26.
[17723.37s -> 17727.98s]  It's gonna be one hit for whoever.
[17727.98s -> 17729.98s]  I gotta go for one in the back.
[17729.98s -> 17732.60s]  I had to do it.
[17732.60s -> 17735.78s]  Fuck.
[17735.78s -> 17743.06s]  I can still do this.
[17743.06s -> 17745.06s]  He's trying to close the gap.
[17745.06s -> 17747.06s]  Oh no.
[17747.06s -> 17749.24s]  That's it.
[17749.24s -> 17752.25s]  I get to do this thing.
[17752.25s -> 17754.25s]  What? No.
[17754.25s -> 17756.74s]  Are you serious?
[17756.74s -> 17760.52s]  He's got nothing in the back.
[17760.52s -> 17762.89s]  Do it.
[17762.89s -> 17764.89s]  You are killing me with this bullshit.
[17764.89s -> 17771.53s]  This is bad, I'm gonna lose.
[17771.53s -> 17774.02s]  Get back, back, back, back, back.
[17774.02s -> 17776.02s]  In the middle, right in the middle, right in the middle.
[17776.02s -> 17779.29s]  How many guts do I have?
[17779.29s -> 17781.29s]  Come on, I need 15 guts.
[17781.29s -> 17783.29s]  11, 12, 13, 14.
[17785.29s -> 17794.06s]  That's how bad I lose.
[17794.06s -> 17809.59s]  Just missed half the attacks I did.
[17809.59s -> 17811.59s]  My stats are way better than that, guys.
[17811.59s -> 17816.07s]  I have like 200 attack.
[17816.07s -> 17823.88s]  I just had to throw my dice in the air and lose.
[17827.53s -> 17829.53s]  And his accuracy is almost as much as his attack power.
[17829.53s -> 17832.66s]  He has like 200 accuracy.
[17832.66s -> 17834.66s]  What the fuck?
[17834.66s -> 17837.54s]  Look at this.
[17837.54s -> 17839.54s]  You're at 170 accuracy and you still are at like 30-45%.
[17841.54s -> 17846.09s]  How much more points do I have to put into this?
[17846.09s -> 17849.10s]  Look at the speed, accuracy.
[17849.10s -> 17851.10s]  That's like one of his top three.
[17851.10s -> 17860.76s]  I gotta get him a new move.
[17860.76s -> 17865.62s]  Alright, no more tournaments.
[17865.62s -> 17869.78s]  You need a new move.
[17869.78s -> 17871.78s]  Something for the mid-range.
[17881.26s -> 17883.26s]  Yeah, you're all coming with me.
[17883.26s -> 17885.62s]  Let's go.
[17889.85s -> 17893.11s]  Trampoline at speed.
[17893.11s -> 17895.11s]  Let's do it again.
[17895.11s -> 17897.11s]  Target.
[17897.11s -> 17899.11s]  Target is fine.
[17899.11s -> 17901.11s]  This is the top right.
[17903.11s -> 17905.61s]  And then you don't need to rest.
[17907.61s -> 17911.13s]  Stand back.
[17911.13s -> 17913.13s]  And then we're going to explore a cave.
[17913.13s -> 17918.50s]  Plus 16.
[17918.50s -> 17923.30s]  That was actually really good.
[17923.30s -> 17929.77s]  Alright, everyone's kind of hungry.
[17929.77s -> 17935.77s]  Except for you, you're fine.
[17935.77s -> 17937.77s]  You're frustrated and hungry.
[17940.71s -> 17947.67s]  Nevermind.
[17947.67s -> 17952.34s]  Why don't you, the biggest monster, eat the others?
[17956.34s -> 17962.17s]  The brightness on your phone is low.
[17965.82s -> 17969.78s]  I was unaware.
[17969.78s -> 17971.78s]  Alright, adventure.
[17971.78s -> 17976.71s]  Take monster, being raised, exploring.
[17976.71s -> 17980.30s]  Caves.
[17980.30s -> 17982.30s]  I'm coming. All of you.
[17985.56s -> 17987.56s]  746 start adventure.
[17987.56s -> 18001.00s]  Hey Jermey, is your refrigerator running?
[18001.00s -> 18004.20s]  Yeah, it grew legs.
[18004.20s -> 18006.20s]  And sprinted out of my house.
[18006.20s -> 18008.20s]  And just sprint punched my roommate in the face.
[18008.20s -> 18011.66s]  And started pissing all over my couch.
[18011.66s -> 18013.66s]  And rolling around on the ground and shit.
[18013.66s -> 18020.12s]  And then it had been in a Kool-Aid band outside.
[18020.12s -> 18022.12s]  As hard as it could into my wall.
[18022.12s -> 18024.12s]  There was glass and stuff. It was fucked up.
[18024.12s -> 18026.12s]  I'm glad you noticed it.
[18026.12s -> 18037.51s]  Then you better go catch it!
[18037.51s -> 18039.51s]  Yeah, I really should, shouldn't I?
[18039.51s -> 18043.67s]  You can't keep doing this stuff and blaming your fridge.
[18045.67s -> 18058.71s]  Here we go. Random battle.
[18058.71s -> 18063.77s]  Somebody's asked me if he's the fountain of youth bullshit.
[18063.77s -> 18068.25s]  I don't probably.
[18068.25s -> 18070.55s]  I have no idea.
[18072.55s -> 18075.43s]  He's dead instantly.
[18075.43s -> 18082.34s]  He finally read it. What do you mean he finally read it?
[18082.34s -> 18084.58s]  Level 2, Vroomer.
[18084.58s -> 18086.76s]  Anything new? What did you get?
[18086.76s -> 18088.76s]  Vroomer obtained Hard Head.
[18088.76s -> 18090.76s]  Vroomer mastered Charge.
[18090.76s -> 18094.22s]  Obtained Nunchaku.
[18097.35s -> 18102.73s]  Nice. New move.
[18102.73s -> 18113.29s]  He's been saying that for like 2 hours.
[18113.29s -> 18117.64s]  Why?
[18117.64s -> 18121.29s]  I don't know. What is that?
[18121.29s -> 18123.91s]  Let me take a look at the data.
[18123.91s -> 18125.91s]  Okay, so we got Charge now.
[18125.91s -> 18127.91s]  This is Charge.
[18127.91s -> 18129.91s]  17 guts.
[18129.91s -> 18131.91s]  Life damage is C.
[18131.91s -> 18133.91s]  Critical hit rating. Accuracies.
[18133.91s -> 18135.91s]  Guts damage.
[18135.91s -> 18137.91s]  It's more accurate than anything I have.
[18137.91s -> 18139.91s]  Except for this.
[18139.91s -> 18141.91s]  It's pretty cheap to do.
[18141.91s -> 18143.91s]  It's cheaper to do than this.
[18143.91s -> 18146.28s]  A little bit less damage than this.
[18148.28s -> 18150.28s]  But, it is
[18150.28s -> 18152.28s]  fairly accurate. Move kind of terrible.
[18152.28s -> 18155.03s]  Alright, he got Hard Head too.
[18155.03s -> 18157.03s]  What the hell is Hard Head?
[18161.40s -> 18163.83s]  Wind Lore.
[18163.83s -> 18165.83s]  Ups wind and fire power and lets you
[18165.83s -> 18167.83s]  add a wind power to skill.
[18167.83s -> 18169.83s]  Does it.
[18169.83s -> 18171.83s]  Increases power of moves that use the head.
[18171.83s -> 18188.84s]  Okay.
[18188.84s -> 18190.84s]  All these streams are Jerva saying
[18190.84s -> 18192.84s]  dumb stuff and chat repeating it.
[18192.84s -> 18204.04s]  Wait, what?
[18204.04s -> 18206.04s]  What was the dumb thing that I said today?
[18206.04s -> 18208.04s]  I didn't say anything dumb.
[18208.04s -> 18216.28s]  What did I say now?
[18216.28s -> 18225.56s]  The refrigerator running
[18225.56s -> 18234.07s]  thing?
[18234.07s -> 18241.05s]  Did I hit this guy?
[18241.05s -> 18257.48s]  Most level 2 for the other ones.
[18257.48s -> 18259.48s]  I need to equip the skill.
[18259.48s -> 18261.85s]  It's not there.
[18267.85s -> 18269.85s]  Oh, I see.
[18271.85s -> 18273.85s]  Okay, so this is slot 1.
[18273.85s -> 18275.85s]  I can't have
[18275.85s -> 18277.85s]  these.
[18277.85s -> 18280.22s]  Okay, so that is a
[18280.22s -> 18282.22s]  move in the front, short range. Alright.
[18284.84s -> 18287.66s]  And backspin is going to be
[18287.66s -> 18289.66s]  in the back.
[18289.66s -> 18291.66s]  Okay, so I'll just go like this in case I want to use it.
[18293.66s -> 18297.11s]  Okay, makes sense.
[18297.11s -> 18303.19s]  It's not April Fools yet.
[18303.19s -> 18305.19s]  Well, it is April Fools on East Coast at the moment.
[18305.19s -> 18313.00s]  So watch out for people playing tricks.
[18313.00s -> 18318.06s]  So I'm going to do something funny.
[18318.06s -> 18320.62s]  And you're going to believe them.
[18320.62s -> 18326.12s]  Let's try the new move, Charge.
[18326.12s -> 18330.26s]  I'm a little too bullish.
[18330.26s -> 18332.76s]  Still a little too bullish.
[18332.76s -> 18335.26s]  You're going to die in here.
[18335.26s -> 18340.17s]  It's pretty good move.
[18340.17s -> 18342.17s]  It's got a high hit percentage too it seems.
[18342.17s -> 18344.98s]  I'm going to take you out.
[18344.98s -> 18347.74s]  Get out of here.
[18347.74s -> 18357.13s]  You died. Last hit, that's good.
[18357.13s -> 18363.02s]  All the gifted subs are April Fools jokes?
[18363.02s -> 18366.47s]  Well, that would be
[18366.47s -> 18368.47s]  pretty weird.
[18368.47s -> 18372.95s]  Ah, almost.
[18372.95s -> 18377.18s]  Another toy robot.
[18377.18s -> 18379.80s]  This thing is stupid.
[18384.33s -> 18386.50s]  Actually stupid.
[18386.50s -> 18390.22s]  Doesn't even do anything.
[18390.22s -> 18392.97s]  Why am I going that way? I'm wasting energy.
[18392.97s -> 18406.39s]  Alright, next floor.
[18406.39s -> 18408.39s]  They should level up the other two and maybe they'll get some new stuff.
[18408.39s -> 18419.78s]  There we go.
[18419.78s -> 18424.44s]  Just don't even let them get up.
[18424.44s -> 18426.44s]  Keep doing it.
[18426.44s -> 18429.77s]  70%.
[18429.77s -> 18433.29s]  Nice.
[18433.29s -> 18435.29s]  Alright, here comes the new skills.
[18435.29s -> 18437.78s]  For level two.
[18437.78s -> 18440.90s]  And?
[18440.90s -> 18442.90s]  Wally obtained a sniper.
[18442.90s -> 18445.53s]  Roberto obtained
[18445.53s -> 18447.96s]  heavy armor.
[18447.96s -> 18451.29s]  And got a junk toy.
[18451.29s -> 18453.98s]  Really, let's see what that is.
[18456.22s -> 18458.22s]  Nope.
[18458.22s -> 18460.22s]  Sniper.
[18460.22s -> 18462.22s]  Increases power of moves that throw
[18462.22s -> 18465.29s]  or shoot.
[18465.29s -> 18467.29s]  So that's going to be much better.
[18467.29s -> 18469.29s]  For this move here.
[18471.29s -> 18473.46s]  This cracker.
[18473.46s -> 18476.15s]  No new
[18476.15s -> 18478.15s]  ability though, unfortunately.
[18478.15s -> 18481.48s]  Alright, what about um, Roberto?
[18481.48s -> 18483.48s]  No move, it was something else. Heavy armor.
[18483.48s -> 18485.48s]  Reduces damage but harder to dodge.
[18485.48s -> 18487.48s]  Okay.
[18487.48s -> 18494.06s]  No new moves for either one of them.
[18494.06s -> 18505.77s]  Alright, so what do you guys think?
[18505.77s -> 18507.77s]  We've been playing for about
[18507.77s -> 18509.77s]  just over five hours.
[18509.77s -> 18513.03s]  Do you want to keep seeing this?
[18513.03s -> 18515.03s]  I think I'm going to continue playing.
[18515.03s -> 18530.71s]  This is branching like crazy.
[18530.71s -> 18537.82s]  Found the chest.
[18537.82s -> 18540.82s]  Got a new move and we found
[18540.82s -> 18543.19s]  document five.
[18543.19s -> 18546.71s]  What the hell is document five?
[18546.71s -> 18552.86s]  Found the
[18552.86s -> 18554.86s]  Fitz Lenderman page.
[18554.86s -> 18557.48s]  Is there any movies lately?
[18557.48s -> 18559.48s]  I've seen...
[18559.48s -> 18561.48s]  The last movie I saw was in the Spiderverse.
[18561.48s -> 18564.10s]  The last one I saw in theaters.
[18564.10s -> 18572.28s]  What is this?
[18572.28s -> 18574.28s]  Rumor can't help you investigate.
[18574.28s -> 18578.76s]  Anybody else?
[18578.76s -> 18581.45s]  One of you guys can do this.
[18581.45s -> 18584.52s]  Wally can't help you investigate.
[18584.52s -> 18587.78s]  Nobody can dig.
[18587.78s -> 18590.02s]  A sword is a shovel.
[18590.02s -> 18602.38s]  Why not Captain Marvel?
[18602.38s -> 18604.38s]  I just haven't had a chance to go
[18604.38s -> 18615.26s]  to the movies.
[18615.26s -> 18617.75s]  Do I dare go down?
[18617.75s -> 18619.75s]  Do I dare go down again?
[18619.75s -> 18623.34s]  542, that's not bad.
[18623.34s -> 18630.36s]  Let's see what's on third floor.
[18630.36s -> 18642.14s]  Roberto is way too loud.
[18642.14s -> 18644.57s]  Yeah, he kind of is.
[18644.57s -> 18646.57s]  They all are though.
[18646.57s -> 18648.57s]  They all have a really loud single audio file
[18648.57s -> 18653.62s]  that plays when they make a step.
[18653.62s -> 18655.62s]  A big money just came in.
[18655.62s -> 18658.06s]  And community size.
[18658.06s -> 18661.00s]  You guys are just
[18661.00s -> 18664.33s]  showering me with money.
[18664.33s -> 18666.33s]  You guys are just dropping money
[18666.33s -> 18668.70s]  into my vacuum clinic.
[18668.70s -> 18671.26s]  Let me pause this. Hold on.
[18671.26s -> 18673.75s]  General lied about Minecraft.
[18673.75s -> 18675.75s]  We have five community subs. First of all, thank you.
[18675.75s -> 18677.75s]  And then
[18677.75s -> 18681.08s]  Gopher yourself
[18681.08s -> 18683.08s]  gave sixty dollars.
[18683.08s -> 18688.20s]  Thank you Gopher.
[18688.20s -> 18693.00s]  It's sixty bucks
[18693.00s -> 18695.43s]  six thousand bits.
[18695.43s -> 18697.43s]  How did this streamer beat the demon of hatred on the first try?
[18697.43s -> 18699.43s]  But die to my
[18699.43s -> 18701.43s]  elderly neighbor Bernard.
[18701.43s -> 18703.43s]  I love this silly streamer. Ha ha.
[18703.43s -> 18708.30s]  There's so much misinformation in that.
[18708.30s -> 18710.30s]  Two sentences.
[18710.30s -> 18715.61s]  But thank you Gopher.
[18715.61s -> 18719.45s]  Thank you with sixty bucks.
[18719.45s -> 18734.07s]  Funny lad.
[18734.07s -> 18736.07s]  Rhino, Rhino Ryan.
[18736.07s -> 18740.62s]  That's kind of cool. It's like a squirtle Mewtwo.
[18744.26s -> 18747.78s]  When do you think he'll get a sword slash?
[18747.78s -> 18749.78s]  I think he's going to take it to level four or five to get it.
[18749.78s -> 18755.54s]  Jeremy, do you know if your earwax is brown
[18755.54s -> 18757.54s]  it means you're stressed out?
[18757.54s -> 18760.36s]  Well my earwax is
[18760.36s -> 18762.36s]  when I put like a little thing in my ear
[18762.36s -> 18765.30s]  The room is almost level three.
[18765.30s -> 18768.70s]  Silver coin.
[18768.70s -> 18770.70s]  When I do a little
[18770.70s -> 18772.70s]  earwax thing, you know
[18772.70s -> 18774.70s]  a q-tip or something. I know you're not supposed to.
[18774.70s -> 18776.70s]  But I do it anyways.
[18776.70s -> 18779.45s]  I can't help it.
[18779.45s -> 18781.75s]  That the entire q-tip industry
[18781.75s -> 18784.06s]  only survives
[18784.06s -> 18786.06s]  only because people do the
[18786.06s -> 18788.06s]  thing they're not supposed to do with a q-tip.
[18788.06s -> 18796.70s]  Put it in your ear.
[18796.70s -> 18799.64s]  But it's like
[18799.64s -> 18802.90s]  they never do anything.
[18802.90s -> 18805.91s]  It's always very clean.
[18805.91s -> 18807.91s]  What I typically like to do is in the shower
[18807.91s -> 18809.91s]  I do a little bit of washcloth
[18809.91s -> 18811.91s]  and I go in the ear and move it around
[18811.91s -> 18813.91s]  so I don't go deep in.
[18816.60s -> 18825.30s]  Always clean.
[18825.30s -> 18828.57s]  Just double tap that guy.
[18828.57s -> 18830.57s]  Jeremy only reads gross and rude comments.
[18830.57s -> 18832.74s]  That's not even true though.
[18832.74s -> 18834.74s]  How many things
[18834.74s -> 18836.74s]  have I said this stream
[18836.74s -> 18838.74s]  that were just responding to questions?
[18838.74s -> 18842.71s]  I'm just responding to
[18842.71s -> 18844.71s]  questions.
[18844.71s -> 18855.40s]  And comments people have.
[18855.40s -> 18857.40s]  I gotta get out of here soon.
[18857.40s -> 18865.53s]  I'm at 472.
[18865.53s -> 18867.96s]  That's a sword.
[18867.96s -> 18872.57s]  Goldal sword?
[18872.57s -> 18874.57s]  Can I put items on in this game?
[18874.57s -> 18878.60s]  What do I do with that?
[18878.60s -> 18889.86s]  Maybe I can just sell it?
[18889.86s -> 18893.90s]  How fast can I dab?
[18893.90s -> 18895.90s]  I don't know. I haven't tracked it.
[18895.90s -> 18897.90s]  I don't have a radar gun to track how fast
[18897.90s -> 18904.17s]  my dabs are.
[18904.17s -> 18906.17s]  If I'm gonna take a guess though, I would say
[18906.17s -> 18908.17s]  probably like 600
[18908.17s -> 18910.17s]  probably 60-50
[18910.17s -> 18913.88s]  miles per hour.
[18913.88s -> 18916.25s]  If I had a radar gun pointed at me.
[18916.25s -> 18918.74s]  Look at this guy.
[18918.74s -> 18922.97s]  Whoa.
[18922.97s -> 18924.97s]  I kinda want this praying mantis person.
[18924.97s -> 18931.69s]  He probably has a ton of speed.
[18931.69s -> 18940.57s]  Sit down.
[18940.57s -> 18942.57s]  Just measure it in DPS.
[18942.57s -> 18944.57s]  Dabs. DPM.
[18944.57s -> 18955.58s]  Dab for a minute.
[18955.58s -> 18957.58s]  Do you think that's ever gonna go away?
[18957.58s -> 18959.58s]  Do you think anyone's ever gonna stop dabbing?
[18959.58s -> 18968.86s]  Transition out.
[18968.86s -> 18971.10s]  It has to be soon, right?
[18971.10s -> 18973.72s]  Okay, level three.
[18973.72s -> 18975.72s]  Roberto obtains
[18975.72s -> 18977.90s]  super weapon.
[18977.90s -> 18979.90s]  Vroomer obtains sniper.
[18979.90s -> 18981.90s]  Roberto mastered swing.
[18981.90s -> 18990.86s]  Okay, finally we can swing the sword.
[18990.86s -> 18992.86s]  Yeah, I ain't gonna lie. Look at Roberto's stats.
[18992.86s -> 18997.85s]  They're actually getting pretty good.
[18997.85s -> 18999.85s]  Okay, let's go into this one here.
[18999.85s -> 19001.85s]  There it is. Swing.
[19001.85s -> 19004.09s]  Life damage C. Accuracy
[19004.09s -> 19006.09s]  rating S.
[19006.09s -> 19010.18s]  This thing will never miss.
[19010.18s -> 19012.74s]  Exactly what I need.
[19012.74s -> 19014.98s]  He just became the character we're gonna be playing with.
[19014.98s -> 19016.98s]  So that takes over
[19016.98s -> 19018.98s]  for kick.
[19018.98s -> 19020.98s]  Yeah, he's got something else too, right?
[19020.98s -> 19022.98s]  Super weapon.
[19022.98s -> 19024.98s]  Increases power of moves
[19024.98s -> 19026.98s]  that use the weapon.
[19026.98s -> 19029.80s]  Nice.
[19029.80s -> 19031.80s]  And then what did I get for...
[19031.80s -> 19034.68s]  I got something else.
[19034.68s -> 19039.22s]  Vroomer, right?
[19039.22s -> 19041.90s]  Sniper.
[19041.90s -> 19044.46s]  Throwing and shooting.
[19044.46s -> 19046.82s]  What counts as that for here?
[19046.82s -> 19048.82s]  Does the backdash count as a throw?
[19048.82s -> 19054.63s]  Charge, backspin,
[19054.63s -> 19056.63s]  with type far range.
[19056.63s -> 19059.00s]  This is a throw?
[19059.00s -> 19061.00s]  This is probably a throw, right?
[19061.00s -> 19068.54s]  I do assume.
[19068.54s -> 19071.35s]  Cool, alright. Well, now they're getting a lot better.
[19071.35s -> 19074.10s]  Just kinda had to do this.
[19074.10s -> 19084.60s]  Oh shit, what is this?
[19084.60s -> 19088.76s]  In the cutscene here.
[19088.76s -> 19091.38s]  What was my last toaster strudel I ate?
[19091.38s -> 19095.10s]  I don't eat toaster strudels.
[19095.10s -> 19097.10s]  So I go by the box
[19097.10s -> 19099.10s]  and you know how the icing is all kind of
[19099.10s -> 19101.10s]  attached, connected like a...
[19101.10s -> 19103.10s]  almost like they're on a string together?
[19103.10s -> 19105.10s]  Well, I take a pair of scissors and
[19105.10s -> 19107.10s]  at the very top of the icing
[19107.10s -> 19109.10s]  there's a little nub
[19109.10s -> 19111.10s]  that you're supposed to squeeze the icing out of.
[19111.10s -> 19113.10s]  So I take a pair of scissors and I cut across
[19113.10s -> 19115.10s]  every single part of the strand of icing
[19115.10s -> 19117.10s]  packets.
[19117.10s -> 19119.10s]  So they're all cut off at the top of the nub.
[19119.10s -> 19121.10s]  And then it's about, I think it's eight
[19121.10s -> 19123.10s]  packets that are connected.
[19123.10s -> 19125.10s]  They're all on top of each other.
[19125.10s -> 19127.10s]  Turn it upside down. Squeeze all eight
[19127.10s -> 19129.10s]  packets at the same time.
[19129.10s -> 19131.10s]  And just drain the icing.
[19131.10s -> 19133.27s]  All eight packages.
[19133.27s -> 19138.01s]  And then I throw the box in the trash.
[19138.01s -> 19149.98s]  What, that's not, is that not normal?
[19149.98s -> 19151.98s]  There's something about this, it's strange. My old friend
[19151.98s -> 19154.86s]  can you hear me?
[19154.86s -> 19157.10s]  Hello, old friend. Who is that?
[19157.10s -> 19159.85s]  Much time has passed since your
[19159.85s -> 19162.09s]  former adventure. But it seems the world
[19162.09s -> 19164.52s]  needs you once again.
[19164.52s -> 19166.52s]  What's happening? Who am I? Where are you?
[19166.52s -> 19169.02s]  Now I am a stone fragment formed
[19169.02s -> 19171.02s]  in the lands of Gaia.
[19171.02s -> 19173.02s]  A Gaia stone, if you will.
[19173.02s -> 19175.32s]  You will understand all
[19175.32s -> 19178.58s]  soon enough. What's up, Rio?
[19178.58s -> 19181.59s]  What a beautiful stone. Yes.
[19181.59s -> 19184.20s]  I'm gonna take it with me.
[19184.20s -> 19193.35s]  Eek. What the fuck was that?
[19193.35s -> 19196.04s]  Rio, what happened?
[19196.04s -> 19198.66s]  I'm okay, sorry.
[19198.66s -> 19201.22s]  Rio, let's go home. Yeah.
[19201.22s -> 19205.32s]  Let's go home.
[19205.32s -> 19207.32s]  That was really fucked up.
[19207.32s -> 19215.58s]  She's having a mental breakdown.
[19215.58s -> 19218.07s]  She touched the magic stone
[19218.07s -> 19220.07s]  and she started hearing voices.
[19220.07s -> 19222.25s]  It started to implant itself in her brain.
[19222.25s -> 19229.35s]  Hey, fain, fain.
[19229.35s -> 19231.35s]  I thought that actually was music, but it's not. I forgot.
[19231.35s -> 19234.49s]  Pollock, you look awfully excited.
[19234.49s -> 19236.66s]  What's going on? Are your
[19236.66s -> 19238.90s]  training gadgets working alright?
[19238.90s -> 19240.90s]  What? Why wouldn't they be?
[19240.90s -> 19243.21s]  There's a Geonite shortage in
[19243.21s -> 19245.21s]  these parts. Gadgets stopped working on
[19245.21s -> 19248.60s]  all the ranches. We seem
[19248.60s -> 19251.48s]  to be doing fine. Well, thank
[19251.48s -> 19253.78s]  goodness. But most of the
[19253.78s -> 19255.78s]  ranches can't train their monsters.
[19255.78s -> 19257.78s]  Official competition may be cancelled
[19257.78s -> 19261.43s]  for the time being.
[19261.43s -> 19268.60s]  What? Don't worry, I'm going to
[19268.60s -> 19271.10s]  look into this. Bye then. I can't do
[19271.10s -> 19277.43s]  any more competitions. Now that he
[19277.43s -> 19279.43s]  mentions it, I have noticed my body
[19279.43s -> 19281.43s]  feeling a bit strange lately.
[19281.43s -> 19284.06s]  But I'm no run-of-the-mill spirit
[19284.06s -> 19286.49s]  tree. I'm tough.
[19286.49s -> 19288.49s]  I think you're the only spirit tree,
[19288.49s -> 19290.49s]  to be honest. Will it be okay?
[19290.49s -> 19292.49s]  I wonder if the training gadgets used
[19292.49s -> 19295.18s]  too much Geonite. No,
[19295.18s -> 19297.18s]  it's not exactly that. It's like the
[19297.18s -> 19299.18s]  Geonite is being sucked down through
[19299.18s -> 19302.06s]  my roots. Your roots?
[19302.06s -> 19304.42s]  We can use the cave to
[19304.42s -> 19306.42s]  check underneath here. Let's do a little
[19306.42s -> 19308.73s]  exploration. Sounds good.
[19308.73s -> 19311.91s]  I just did that though. Don't they
[19311.91s -> 19319.85s]  need to rest? Wait, check
[19319.85s -> 19325.48s]  the fan art. What are you talking about? Fridge pissing.
[19325.48s -> 19327.48s]  What are you guys linking here?
[19327.48s -> 19336.76s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm trying
[19336.76s -> 19339.96s]  to click it. A comic book?
[19339.96s -> 19342.33s]  Oh, intelligence
[19342.33s -> 19344.33s]  482. With my vast
[19344.33s -> 19346.33s]  intellect, I have analyzed all possible
[19346.33s -> 19348.33s]  futures. You have no chance of victory.
[19348.33s -> 19354.97s]  K.O.
[19354.97s -> 19357.27s]  A whole comic book?
[19357.27s -> 19359.27s]  Holy shit, that was fast.
[19359.27s -> 19361.45s]  You made a whole comic book.
[19361.45s -> 19366.57s]  That's true though. What the hell would you
[19366.57s -> 19368.57s]  buy? That was the weirdest monster.
[19368.57s -> 19370.57s]  See, I feel like the game broke.
[19370.57s -> 19384.89s]  Here, I'll show it. No, that's not
[19384.89s -> 19405.37s]  what I want. There you go. See?
[19405.37s -> 19415.99s]  482.
[19415.99s -> 19419.70s]  I want to try that with a monster.
[19419.70s -> 19422.39s]  You know what? Not today.
[19422.39s -> 19427.13s]  But on the next stream. On the next stream,
[19427.13s -> 19429.13s]  I want to completely design
[19429.13s -> 19431.13s]  a monster around only having
[19431.13s -> 19433.62s]  only speed and only
[19433.62s -> 19436.76s]  accuracy. So you could just
[19436.76s -> 19438.76s]  spam a shitty move
[19438.76s -> 19443.43s]  and hit it every time. Who cares?
[19443.43s -> 19448.62s]  But that was from Drosophilia.
[19448.62s -> 19450.62s]  Thank you, Drosophilia.
[19450.62s -> 19462.46s]  It's a new day on the East Coast.
[19462.46s -> 19464.95s]  Yeah, it is technically a new day.
[19464.95s -> 19467.45s]  Nah, I'm not done streaming now.
[19467.45s -> 19469.62s]  What are you talking about? We're still going.
[19469.62s -> 19472.31s]  I'll go for like another hour or two.
[19472.31s -> 19477.94s]  It's April 1st.
[19477.94s -> 19479.94s]  That means, I'm just kidding. Stream ends in like
[19479.94s -> 19487.43s]  10 minutes. Alright, what we got for a
[19487.43s -> 19489.43s]  second? We need to go into the...
[19489.43s -> 19491.61s]  There's no training allowed, right?
[19491.61s -> 19493.61s]  Everyone's tired. Rest.
[19496.98s -> 19505.75s]  Everybody go to bed. And then after
[19505.75s -> 19507.75s]  this, we're going to go into the
[19507.75s -> 19510.95s]  cave again, because we have scripted
[19510.95s -> 19514.92s]  cave content. And also,
[19514.92s -> 19516.92s]  by the way, for those of you that are
[19516.92s -> 19518.92s]  curious, I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[19518.92s -> 19521.80s]  I came back for one day
[19521.80s -> 19524.81s]  here, because
[19524.81s -> 19527.11s]  this has been
[19527.11s -> 19529.11s]  Kim's birthday weekend.
[19529.11s -> 19533.26s]  And there's some stuff
[19533.26s -> 19535.26s]  that I want to do. We went out
[19535.26s -> 19537.26s]  already, but tomorrow
[19537.26s -> 19539.26s]  I want to
[19539.26s -> 19542.33s]  take her somewhere else. It's not an
[19542.33s -> 19544.89s]  April Fool's joke, that's for real.
[19544.89s -> 19546.89s]  It's not April Fool's, I promise
[19546.89s -> 19549.90s]  you. Don't you guys know why
[19549.90s -> 19551.90s]  April Fool's jokes and joke
[19551.90s -> 19553.90s]  streams don't even happen on April 1st?
[19553.90s -> 19555.90s]  They happen on like April 11th.
[19555.90s -> 19565.42s]  Good luck.
[19565.42s -> 19567.42s]  April Fool's proposal.
[19567.42s -> 19571.06s]  No, this is Kim's birthday
[19571.06s -> 19575.03s]  weekend. And as you know,
[19575.03s -> 19577.03s]  you celebrate the whole
[19577.03s -> 19579.03s]  week when it's somebody's birthday, not just
[19579.03s -> 19588.12s]  a day. Stream the date.
[19588.12s -> 19590.74s]  I don't think so.
[19590.74s -> 19592.74s]  But, uh, I just want
[19592.74s -> 19594.92s]  to make that clear. And then I'll be
[19594.92s -> 19597.10s]  back. We'll go
[19597.10s -> 19599.10s]  April 2nd, April
[19599.10s -> 19601.10s]  3rd, and probably April 4th.
[19601.10s -> 19603.59s]  And then we'll see what we're doing.
[19603.59s -> 19612.49s]  We'll do another three days
[19612.49s -> 19615.62s]  in a row. After
[19615.62s -> 19621.43s]  tomorrow.
[19621.43s -> 19627.19s]  But now, where are we going now?
[19627.19s -> 19629.19s]  Everybody's all rested? Anybody hungry?
[19629.19s -> 19633.22s]  Because we have to go and do the scripted
[19633.22s -> 19635.22s]  thing. You are hungry, you have a potato.
[19645.06s -> 19647.06s]  Can't wait for the quick stream clip of Jerma throwing
[19647.06s -> 19649.06s]  a pine Kim's face for April Fool's.
[19649.06s -> 19652.07s]  No.
[19652.07s -> 19658.79s]  Like a 10 second stream?
[19658.79s -> 19660.79s]  That would be so bad.
[19660.79s -> 19662.79s]  Alright, adventure, let's go.
[19662.79s -> 19667.64s]  The owl is in energy this time.
[19667.64s -> 19683.90s]  So we have to go under the tree.
[19683.90s -> 19689.02s]  Every day is
[19689.02s -> 19691.02s]  my birthday. Every single day.
[19691.02s -> 19711.30s]  The bats are really annoying. Yeah, they
[19711.30s -> 19713.30s]  really are. They kind of just don't do anything.
[19713.30s -> 19715.30s]  Just fly around. Nobody can get in here.
[19715.30s -> 19719.53s]  Rumor cannot help you investigate.
[19719.53s -> 19730.66s]  No, you can't.
[19730.66s -> 19732.66s]  So, floor three? Floor four?
[19732.66s -> 19737.02s]  Everyone expects me to read
[19737.02s -> 19739.19s]  that. But I'm not going to.
[19739.19s -> 19741.19s]  Because I'm going to try to break
[19741.19s -> 19743.19s]  from the habit apparently if I look over and read
[19743.19s -> 19745.19s]  the weird gross thing that somebody wrote.
[19745.19s -> 19749.93s]  Not tonight.
[19749.93s -> 19753.51s]  I was about to read it out loud. I'm
[19753.51s -> 19755.51s]  starting to learn. I'm starting to figure out how to be
[19755.51s -> 19760.25s]  a streamer. Alright, let's try this new move.
[19760.25s -> 19762.87s]  Let's get uh,
[19762.87s -> 19764.87s]  let's get Roberto in here. So this is
[19764.87s -> 19767.30s]  swing. What's the chance on it?
[19767.30s -> 19769.30s]  76%.
[19769.30s -> 19774.79s]  That's a pretty great move.
[19774.79s -> 19777.93s]  Is it weird that I want to
[19777.93s -> 19782.34s]  turn this into the main character?
[19782.34s -> 19789.19s]  I feel like stat wise.
[19789.19s -> 19791.19s]  Alright, that's back to back.
[19791.19s -> 19803.03s]  Let's go. Nobody else got any moves,
[19803.03s -> 19807.13s]  right? There's something so timid.
[19807.13s -> 19811.02s]  89 damage.
[19811.02s -> 19813.02s]  Overkill.
[19813.02s -> 19818.39s]  Roberto is the protagonist.
[19818.39s -> 19820.39s]  Rumor is the funny sidekick.
[19820.39s -> 19823.46s]  That's true.
[19823.46s -> 19831.78s]  That's actually a really good point.
[19831.78s -> 19836.65s]  Document seven. Uh, let's actually
[19838.65s -> 19840.89s]  let's get Wally up here and
[19840.89s -> 19842.89s]  level up Wally to level three.
[19842.89s -> 19854.09s]  And Wally is the cute pet.
[19854.09s -> 19856.52s]  Wally is the cute pet that doesn't do anything
[19856.52s -> 19858.52s]  for the whole series, but like
[19858.52s -> 19860.52s]  two times over the course of
[19860.52s -> 19862.52s]  400 episodes will save everybody
[19862.52s -> 19872.57s]  for some reason.
[19872.57s -> 19877.75s]  Come on, I got extra damage on this, right?
[19877.75s -> 19882.92s]  Really? Not bad. Not very good
[19882.92s -> 19889.58s]  either. More damage on my
[19889.58s -> 19891.94s]  ranged attacks.
[19891.94s -> 19895.53s]  Team up.
[19895.53s -> 19898.79s]  I think I need more intelligence
[19898.79s -> 19906.28s]  that's why it's not doing any damage.
[19906.28s -> 19908.28s]  Alright, you have to get the
[19908.28s -> 19910.28s]  last hit, but you're really making this hard.
[19910.28s -> 19920.78s]  The baby, Walnut Baby
[19920.78s -> 19924.36s]  has to get last hit.
[19924.36s -> 19926.36s]  Or Walnut, or Wally might just die.
[19926.36s -> 19928.36s]  Wally's gonna die.
[19928.36s -> 19930.66s]  Alright, pull him out. Sometimes you gotta
[19930.66s -> 19942.63s]  know when to fold.
[19942.63s -> 19944.63s]  The Labo VR comes out on April 12th.
[19944.63s -> 19950.07s]  I can't wait.
[19950.07s -> 19958.78s]  Obtained a Nunchaku.
[19958.78s -> 19960.78s]  I cannot wait to do Labo VR.
[19960.78s -> 19963.91s]  I'm gonna lose
[19963.91s -> 19966.15s]  like 10,000 followers
[19966.15s -> 19968.15s]  and like 1,500 people on sub.
[19968.15s -> 19970.15s]  I have to do it though.
[19970.15s -> 19983.96s]  I have to. Not gonna be able to
[19983.96s -> 19985.96s]  stream it though, we can't see the screen.
[19985.96s -> 19991.06s]  I'll find a way. You guys
[19991.06s -> 19993.30s]  can just do it. I'll put the webcam
[19993.30s -> 19995.30s]  inside of the machine and let you guys do it.
[19995.30s -> 20009.96s]  Kermit's gonna go on a Labo
[20009.96s -> 20011.96s]  Cardboard VR date with
[20011.96s -> 20014.58s]  Kim.
[20014.58s -> 20033.83s]  Alright, level up.
[20033.83s -> 20035.83s]  Burn all your old Labo shit.
[20035.83s -> 20039.22s]  I don't even have it anymore.
[20039.22s -> 20041.46s]  Suiko E.
[20041.46s -> 20043.46s]  Alright, give me a last hit.
[20043.46s -> 20047.69s]  You only have 43 health.
[20047.69s -> 20059.58s]  Do it!
[20059.58s -> 20062.58s]  29%. This is not gonna hit.
[20062.58s -> 20068.54s]  35%.
[20068.54s -> 20070.54s]  I could have burnt it for content.
[20070.54s -> 20073.42s]  No, that's dangerous.
[20073.42s -> 20075.42s]  I may have gotten injured during that.
[20075.42s -> 20085.91s]  What a lame streamer.
[20085.91s -> 20087.91s]  10% chance to hit.
[20087.91s -> 20089.91s]  I may as well just stay back here forever.
[20089.91s -> 20093.05s]  But that would be some content.
[20093.05s -> 20098.23s]  Wally, you're really
[20098.23s -> 20112.06s]  kind of pissing me off here.
[20112.06s -> 20114.06s]  You guys don't wanna see that. That's not like, no.
[20114.06s -> 20121.86s]  I don't think it's time to freezer Wally yet.
[20121.86s -> 20135.94s]  Not yet.
[20135.94s -> 20138.12s]  He was so irritated. He was just like,
[20138.12s -> 20142.34s]  Jesus Christ, I'll take care of this.
[20142.34s -> 20147.02s]  Alright, fine. Level three.
[20147.02s -> 20149.19s]  Wally obtained King's Fist
[20149.19s -> 20151.43s]  and mastered Magic Hand
[20151.43s -> 20154.25s]  and obtained Reference.
[20154.25s -> 20161.86s]  Magic Hand.
[20161.86s -> 20164.23s]  Short range.
[20164.23s -> 20166.23s]  Finally a move that has
[20166.23s -> 20168.23s]  accuracy.
[20168.23s -> 20171.05s]  And it's short range. This is perfect.
[20171.05s -> 20173.05s]  Okay. I gotta start building intelligence.
[20173.05s -> 20175.05s]  What does Wally even have for
[20175.05s -> 20181.19s]  stats?
[20181.19s -> 20183.19s]  That's actually not that bad.
[20183.19s -> 20185.56s]  Pretty good, actually.
[20185.56s -> 20189.59s]  Alright, what else did you just learn?
[20189.59s -> 20191.83s]  King's Fist
[20191.83s -> 20193.83s]  versus power moves that use the fists.
[20193.83s -> 20201.70s]  Alright, Wally.
[20201.70s -> 20203.70s]  What smell do you think of when you picture the color
[20203.70s -> 20206.14s]  aquamarine?
[20206.14s -> 20208.14s]  A blue popsicle.
[20208.14s -> 20212.66s]  You know what I'm talking about.
[20212.66s -> 20221.88s]  Got an amethyst.
[20221.88s -> 20228.41s]  Cool. The smell of a blue popsicle.
[20228.41s -> 20240.25s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[20240.25s -> 20243.45s]  You have to do it.
[20243.45s -> 20245.45s]  The electric blue raspberry popsicle.
[20245.45s -> 20247.45s]  Smell it.
[20247.45s -> 20253.40s]  Oh, man. I can't get him with the comedy
[20253.40s -> 20256.60s]  move.
[20256.60s -> 20259.35s]  It's a double hit.
[20259.35s -> 20272.98s]  What's that? 60%?
[20272.98s -> 20276.70s]  Artificial blueberry. Yes.
[20276.70s -> 20278.70s]  Alright, let's get the guy that actually can hurt things
[20278.70s -> 20285.80s]  out here, please.
[20285.80s -> 20288.17s]  That's not good. Really?
[20288.17s -> 20294.31s]  82.
[20294.31s -> 20304.55s]  I'm taking this guy to the top.
[20304.55s -> 20306.55s]  Can I get Roberto level four before this is all done?
[20306.55s -> 20311.29s]  Can you throw Wally off a rooftop?
[20311.29s -> 20313.29s]  Even if I did, it wouldn't be a problem.
[20313.29s -> 20315.29s]  He would just close into his walnut shell.
[20315.29s -> 20317.29s]  And it would be fine.
[20317.29s -> 20324.26s]  Wally's gonna be a slow brain.
[20324.26s -> 20330.47s]  Why did you have to just write that?
[20330.47s -> 20332.47s]  I just made some salsa. Do you want some?
[20332.47s -> 20334.65s]  Why did you write that? Now I want some.
[20334.65s -> 20336.65s]  I actually do want that now.
[20336.65s -> 20350.46s]  87.
[20350.46s -> 20352.82s]  Aww. Ended with another one.
[20352.82s -> 20355.58s]  Actually, now I can bring out...
[20355.58s -> 20357.94s]  No, I'll just...
[20357.94s -> 20369.91s]  What kind of salsa, though?
[20369.91s -> 20371.91s]  This is a lot of different kinds.
[20371.91s -> 20373.91s]  Are we talking like a peach salsa?
[20373.91s -> 20375.91s]  A mango salsa? Raspberry salsa?
[20375.91s -> 20377.91s]  Black bean salsa?
[20377.91s -> 20379.91s]  Maybe a little bit of queso on the side?
[20379.91s -> 20381.91s]  I want this so bad.
[20381.91s -> 20383.91s]  I'll see you later. I'm leaving.
[20383.91s -> 20393.00s]  I'll see you guys in like a month.
[20393.00s -> 20395.00s]  What if I stopped streaming for a month?
[20395.00s -> 20406.71s]  You already did that.
[20406.71s -> 20409.21s]  Yeah, I know. Like before.
[20409.21s -> 20411.38s]  Yeah, just...
[20411.38s -> 20413.38s]  No, not just to eat salsa. This is kind of just...
[20413.38s -> 20417.80s]  We're just hanging out.
[20417.80s -> 20419.80s]  I'll see you guys in a month.
[20419.80s -> 20421.80s]  I'm gonna eat salsa.
[20421.80s -> 20433.19s]  I'm gonna be a salsa review channel on YouTube.
[20433.19s -> 20435.19s]  Well, to be fair, the reason why I stopped streaming for a month
[20435.19s -> 20437.19s]  is because I was traveling
[20437.19s -> 20439.50s]  across the whole country
[20439.50s -> 20443.13s]  in an inflated air car.
[20443.13s -> 20445.13s]  Alright, let's go, Roberto.
[20445.13s -> 20450.89s]  Mastered cut in two.
[20450.89s -> 20452.89s]  Yeah, I think Roberto's gonna be the one that takes us to the top here.
[20457.50s -> 20459.50s]  Short swing mid-range.
[20459.50s -> 20461.67s]  Cut in two.
[20461.67s -> 20464.36s]  Holy shit, look at that damage.
[20464.36s -> 20466.36s]  An A for damage.
[20466.36s -> 20469.37s]  Terrible accuracy.
[20469.37s -> 20472.89s]  But that's pretty amazing.
[20472.89s -> 20475.96s]  I wonder how much damage that actually does.
[20475.96s -> 20491.82s]  We'll find out.
[20491.82s -> 20494.12s]  Alright, let's pull it out. Let's see what happens.
[20494.12s -> 20496.12s]  Alright, cut in two.
[20496.12s -> 20499.96s]  The regular slash does like 90 damage.
[20499.96s -> 20501.96s]  I wonder how much this does.
[20501.96s -> 20508.47s]  Oh, he's gone.
[20508.47s -> 20511.29s]  He's right up on me, huh?
[20511.29s -> 20513.66s]  Alright, fine, I guess. Alright.
[20513.66s -> 20515.66s]  Alright, alright. It's time.
[20515.66s -> 20518.86s]  Let me just kill this motherfucker.
[20518.86s -> 20520.86s]  Bounce it back.
[20520.86s -> 20529.88s]  Cut in two.
[20529.88s -> 20534.87s]  Less damage than the other one.
[20534.87s -> 20536.87s]  Thoughts on recent politics? Yeah, sure, fuck.
[20536.87s -> 20540.20s]  Fuck.
[20540.20s -> 20556.07s]  This and that and that.
[20556.07s -> 20564.33s]  I think I have to make it to the fourth floor here.
[20564.33s -> 20566.33s]  Floor three, this is where we found the little tablet.
[20566.33s -> 20579.51s]  What did I have to eat today?
[20579.51s -> 20583.29s]  Two eggs.
[20583.29s -> 20588.02s]  Some orange juice.
[20588.02s -> 20590.33s]  And a bowl of Lucky Charms.
[20590.33s -> 20592.70s]  But I take out all the
[20592.70s -> 20594.70s]  actual cereal parts and I only eat
[20594.70s -> 20599.75s]  the marshmallow. It takes a long time
[20599.75s -> 20606.09s]  when I do it.
[20606.09s -> 20608.09s]  I just put them back in the box.
[20608.09s -> 20610.09s]  So it's like as if when I'm pouring it,
[20610.09s -> 20618.54s]  it's like its own cereal.
[20618.54s -> 20627.75s]  Troron.
[20627.75s -> 20629.75s]  You might as well just eat spoonfuls of sugar.
[20629.75s -> 20638.06s]  You actually...
[20638.06s -> 20640.74s]  Yeah, I'll be right back. I want to show you.
[20640.74s -> 20737.00s]  It's actually really hard to do this.
[20737.00s -> 20742.42s]  So,
[20742.42s -> 20747.40s]  Lucky Charms.
[20747.40s -> 20760.52s]  It's hard to put a lot of milk on these though.
[20760.52s -> 20764.98s]  No, it's good. Social eating.
[20764.98s -> 20773.50s]  I love Lucky Charms.
[20773.50s -> 20785.91s]  You guys thought I was making that up. I do this.
[20785.91s -> 20795.32s]  I've been doing it since I was like 11.
[20795.32s -> 20797.32s]  You have to put the milk at the bottom.
[20797.32s -> 20802.63s]  Because too much milk.
[20802.63s -> 20804.63s]  Too much milk will cause...
[20804.63s -> 20806.63s]  The sogginess of these marshmallows really gets bad
[20806.63s -> 20812.01s]  after about 30 seconds.
[20812.01s -> 20814.01s]  Why is everybody making fun of me?
[20814.01s -> 20820.22s]  You have weird shit that you do.
[20820.22s -> 20837.43s]  What weird shit do you do?
[20837.43s -> 20844.92s]  What fucked up shit do you do?
[20844.92s -> 20846.92s]  Tell me I don't fucking do that. Somebody called me a liar.
[20846.92s -> 20857.86s]  I put ketchup on my sandwiches.
[20857.86s -> 20868.49s]  That's fucking weird.
[20868.49s -> 20871.11s]  How long does it take to do?
[20871.11s -> 20874.31s]  Well, I buy like 15 boxes.
[20874.31s -> 20876.62s]  Because it really...
[20876.62s -> 20878.62s]  10 to 15 boxes makes one box of marshmallows.
[20878.62s -> 20904.41s]  And I throw the rest in the trash.
[20904.41s -> 20907.54s]  I don't know why this is so weird.
[20907.54s -> 20912.66s]  April Fool's...
[20912.66s -> 20914.66s]  It's 9.50pm
[20914.66s -> 20917.10s]  March 31st.
[20917.10s -> 20925.34s]  April Fool's. What are you talking about?
[20925.34s -> 20933.27s]  This is where your money goes, chat.
[20933.27s -> 20935.27s]  Rumor mastered bang drum.
[20935.27s -> 20943.34s]  It's not an April Fool's joke.
[20943.34s -> 20952.04s]  I just have this.
[20952.04s -> 20964.26s]  One sub is one box.
[20964.26s -> 20966.26s]  Somebody's really concerned.
[20966.26s -> 20968.26s]  Why would you waste money on brand name cereal and throw it away?
[20968.26s -> 20981.83s]  That's not...
[20981.83s -> 20985.03s]  It's alright.
[20985.03s -> 20996.73s]  What a monster.
[20996.73s -> 20998.73s]  How long does it take you to filter a whole box out?
[20998.73s -> 21012.02s]  A long time.
[21012.02s -> 21014.02s]  This is like burning my mouth.
[21014.02s -> 21016.90s]  Alright.
[21016.90s -> 21018.90s]  We got...
[21018.90s -> 21022.30s]  What happened?
[21022.30s -> 21027.10s]  It was Wally, right?
[21027.10s -> 21036.44s]  Rumor?
[21036.44s -> 21038.44s]  Yeah, okay.
[21038.44s -> 21041.58s]  Bang drum.
[21041.58s -> 21043.58s]  Life damage E. Accuracy rate D.
[21043.58s -> 21054.57s]  So addled.
[21054.57s -> 21056.57s]  Does your dentist know you do this?
[21056.57s -> 21059.90s]  He actually encourages it.
[21059.90s -> 21061.90s]  In his way, he said,
[21061.90s -> 21063.90s]  If you just eat sugary cereals every day,
[21063.90s -> 21065.90s]  you'll be more inclined to want to brush your teeth.
[21065.90s -> 21068.97s]  You're supposed to brush your teeth twice a day.
[21068.97s -> 21070.97s]  If you eat lucky charms only,
[21070.97s -> 21072.97s]  the marshmallow parts, he said,
[21072.97s -> 21076.04s]  for at least breakfast and dinner,
[21076.04s -> 21078.04s]  you'll have to brush your teeth.
[21078.04s -> 21080.54s]  Because last time I went to the dentist,
[21080.54s -> 21082.84s]  I hadn't brushed my teeth in about two years.
[21082.84s -> 21084.84s]  And these are all fake.
[21084.84s -> 21113.64s]  All these teeth are fake.
[21113.64s -> 21116.39s]  I hate this bit.
[21116.39s -> 21118.39s]  Do you though?
[21118.39s -> 21126.44s]  Are you sure?
[21126.44s -> 21135.14s]  Water. Can I go in there?
[21135.14s -> 21137.14s]  You're a bad influence on your child viewers.
[21137.14s -> 21139.14s]  Please take responsibility and brush your teeth on stream.
[21139.14s -> 21151.37s]  No, that's gross.
[21151.37s -> 21154.31s]  That's weird.
[21154.31s -> 21157.19s]  Child viewers.
[21157.19s -> 21161.19s]  How old do you think people are watching this channel?
[21161.19s -> 21163.19s]  How old do you think they are?
[21163.19s -> 21177.78s]  Four?
[21177.78s -> 21185.59s]  Speaking of four, we're going to the fourth floor.
[21185.59s -> 21188.34s]  By the way, have you ever had astronaut ice cream?
[21188.34s -> 21190.58s]  It is just
[21190.58s -> 21192.58s]  Lucky Charms marshmallows.
[21192.58s -> 21195.46s]  Gigantic ones.
[21195.46s -> 21197.46s]  Space ice cream?
[21197.46s -> 21199.46s]  If you're one of those people that loves to eat
[21199.46s -> 21201.46s]  freeze-dried marshmallow, like I do,
[21201.46s -> 21208.31s]  I've got a whole bowl of it over here.
[21208.31s -> 21210.31s]  Yeah, and it's fucking garbage.
[21210.31s -> 21220.79s]  Relax.
[21220.79s -> 21224.89s]  Freeze-dried stuff is way too chalky.
[21224.89s -> 21226.89s]  I mean, if you eat chalk.
[21226.89s -> 21230.22s]  Alright, I'm going to stop
[21230.22s -> 21232.22s]  because people are going to think this is like real.
[21234.22s -> 21242.73s]  I really don't want to end up
[21242.73s -> 21244.73s]  somewhere where people think that like, holy shit, he's like
[21244.73s -> 21247.48s]  fucking insane.
[21247.48s -> 21268.20s]  He's kind of good though.
[21268.20s -> 21270.20s]  This haha dentist and cereal joke.
[21272.20s -> 21282.12s]  Why can't I do anything?
[21282.12s -> 21286.22s]  I just dry heaved
[21286.22s -> 21288.22s]  because I heard him eating it.
[21288.22s -> 21290.22s]  It's not like dog poo.
[21290.22s -> 21292.22s]  It's marshmallow.
[21292.22s -> 21294.84s]  You act like I'm eating
[21294.84s -> 21296.84s]  a bowl of paint.
[21296.84s -> 21298.84s]  Or like somebody else's throw up.
[21298.84s -> 21300.84s]  What? It's freeze-dried
[21300.84s -> 21303.46s]  marshmallow.
[21303.46s -> 21305.46s]  What's wrong with it? What's the problem?
[21305.46s -> 21313.27s]  Like I'm not eating
[21313.27s -> 21315.27s]  blended up cold hot dogs
[21315.27s -> 21317.58s]  with a spoon.
[21317.58s -> 21342.58s]  Swing.
[21342.58s -> 21345.85s]  I would pay you to do that.
[21345.85s -> 21354.04s]  I'm not going to do that.
[21354.04s -> 21365.10s]  I would never do something like that.
[21365.10s -> 21367.10s]  Disgusting. Cereal, cereal
[21367.10s -> 21369.10s]  filter.
[21369.10s -> 21372.74s]  No, you want to actually, the best cereal I've ever had was
[21372.74s -> 21377.48s]  original cookie crisp.
[21379.48s -> 21386.14s]  I'm not talking about cookie crisp now.
[21386.14s -> 21391.13s]  Back when it was made with animal fat.
[21391.13s -> 21393.13s]  Whatever the hell it was.
[21393.13s -> 21395.13s]  It was great.
[21395.13s -> 21406.39s]  Stop it. Let me do something.
[21406.39s -> 21409.46s]  I can't even do anything.
[21409.46s -> 21411.46s]  He's just doing E over and over again.
[21411.46s -> 21417.48s]  Cookie crisp now is not very good.
[21417.48s -> 21426.18s]  I'm going to block. Alright, bring in the
[21426.18s -> 21428.18s]  real. Bring in the real
[21428.18s -> 21430.18s]  one here, please.
[21430.18s -> 21432.18s]  Is he dead?
[21432.18s -> 21441.53s]  I wasn't even paying attention. Did he get killed?
[21441.53s -> 21443.53s]  Can I please do something?
[21443.53s -> 21445.53s]  Oh my god.
[21445.53s -> 21449.43s]  If I die to this
[21449.43s -> 21451.43s]  I'm going to be so
[21451.43s -> 21456.98s]  angry.
[21464.65s -> 21467.02s]  Oh my god.
[21467.02s -> 21469.02s]  Finally. Alright, the big money came then.
[21469.02s -> 21472.54s]  Thank you Kairosobi for the
[21472.54s -> 21474.54s]  50 bucks.
[21474.54s -> 21476.54s]  5,000 bits. This is for the
[21476.54s -> 21478.54s]  Marshmallow Fund you 4-2 Leprechaun.
[21478.54s -> 21503.86s]  Boomerang.
[21503.86s -> 21506.30s]  I don't even want these.
[21506.30s -> 21512.38s]  I'm going to put them back in the box.
[21512.38s -> 21525.75s]  I don't want any more of this comedy cereal.
[21525.75s -> 21527.75s]  You're watching Boomerang.
[21527.75s -> 21540.17s]  It's all coming back to you.
[21540.17s -> 21543.50s]  What would your own cereal be? Something
[21543.50s -> 21545.50s]  light. You know Pops?
[21545.50s -> 21551.05s]  It would be something like Pops.
[21551.05s -> 21553.05s]  But with a lighter coating.
[21553.05s -> 21560.07s]  It's not as sugary.
[21560.07s -> 21562.07s]  Leave because of Roberto?
[21562.07s -> 21564.07s]  I'm not going to get the
[21564.07s -> 21566.70s]  cuts in here.
[21566.70s -> 21574.36s]  I have a fucking
[21574.36s -> 21589.53s]  stomach ache now.
[21589.53s -> 21591.53s]  Whose fault is that?
[21591.53s -> 21595.11s]  Jax mix.
[21595.11s -> 21598.12s]  There's like bacteria in these.
[21598.12s -> 21600.55s]  Somebody look it up.
[21600.55s -> 21602.55s]  Is that
[21602.55s -> 21605.82s]  bacteria in
[21605.82s -> 21624.89s]  freeze-dried marshmallows?
[21624.89s -> 21626.89s]  Bacteria in everything.
[21626.89s -> 21639.14s]  That's true.
[21639.14s -> 21641.32s]  You guys know that
[21641.32s -> 21643.32s]  according to doctors
[21643.32s -> 21645.94s]  humans should
[21645.94s -> 21647.94s]  not be taking in more than 32
[21647.94s -> 21649.94s]  grams of sugar or 36
[21649.94s -> 21651.94s]  grams of sugar a day
[21651.94s -> 21654.82s]  of added sugars.
[21654.82s -> 21656.82s]  That is like a whole day.
[21656.82s -> 21658.82s]  Do not consume more than
[21658.82s -> 21660.82s]  38 grams
[21660.82s -> 21663.00s]  of added sugar a day.
[21663.00s -> 21665.50s]  You know how much sugar is in a can of
[21665.50s -> 21670.92s]  Coke?
[21670.92s -> 21679.50s]  39 grams. You know how much is in Mountain Dew?
[21679.50s -> 21681.50s]  Throwback?
[21681.50s -> 21690.58s]  44.
[21690.58s -> 21692.58s]  I've said the same shit before. Yeah.
[21692.58s -> 21695.27s]  Well there's probably a bunch of new people here.
[21695.27s -> 21697.27s]  It's 42 grams of sugar buddy.
[21697.27s -> 21699.27s]  Oh I don't think so. Look it up.
[21699.27s -> 21701.27s]  Added sugar a day for a male
[21701.27s -> 21703.27s]  is like 38. For a female I believe
[21703.27s -> 21706.09s]  it's like 30.
[21706.09s -> 21713.05s]  That's what it says. Look it up.
[21713.05s -> 21715.05s]  Why do I know this? Because my dentist told me.
[21715.05s -> 21727.14s]  Alright.
[21727.14s -> 21729.14s]  I need to figure this out. How much sugar is in one
[21729.14s -> 21735.61s]  Lucky Charm Marshmallow?
[21735.61s -> 21737.61s]  Do we know how many grams of sugar is in one?
[21737.61s -> 21750.65s]  Level 5 for Vroomer.
[21750.65s -> 21752.65s]  What's going on? Nothing? Nothing new at level 5?
[21752.65s -> 21759.37s]  0.25
[21759.37s -> 21761.86s]  grams. I googled it.
[21761.86s -> 21768.39s]  There you go. Put this weight on a scale
[21768.39s -> 21778.95s]  because that's all it is.
[21778.95s -> 21781.45s]  My back hurts now.
[21781.45s -> 21783.45s]  What's with this fucking bacteria marshmallow
[21783.45s -> 21793.88s]  shit that I just ate?
[21793.88s -> 21801.75s]  Alright am I almost there?
[21801.75s -> 21810.52s]  Sugar is reverse salt.
[21810.52s -> 21812.52s]  Does it go underneath the tree?
[21812.52s -> 21820.39s]  How many marshmallows do we eat at a time?
[21820.39s -> 21822.39s]  Oh it's probably like 300 or 400 in here.
[21822.39s -> 21835.96s]  I can't believe you guys fell for the oldest April Fools joke
[21835.96s -> 21838.78s]  in the book. Guy eats
[21838.78s -> 21840.78s]  a bowl of marshmallows.
[21851.26s -> 21853.26s]  Somebody says we didn't.
[21853.26s -> 21861.13s]  Oh yeah the classic April
[21861.13s -> 21863.13s]  Fools joke. This thing looks
[21863.13s -> 21875.98s]  pretty dangerous.
[21875.98s -> 21885.19s]  Joke's on us. He just painted
[21885.19s -> 21887.19s]  wood chips to look like marshmallows.
[21887.19s -> 21889.19s]  Yeah. This is like
[21889.19s -> 21891.19s]  clay. You guys didn't even know.
[21891.19s -> 21900.46s]  Alright get me to the tree
[21900.46s -> 21903.40s]  before they all die.
[21903.40s -> 21905.64s]  Oh my god. What the hell?
[21905.64s -> 21910.50s]  Play-Doh unironically
[21910.50s -> 21913.45s]  tastes good. Well you should
[21913.45s -> 21915.45s]  unironically probably stop doing that.
[21915.45s -> 21918.26s]  That's really not good for you.
[21925.94s -> 21935.22s]  Play-Doh is vegan.
[21935.22s -> 21941.03s]  Yeah and
[21941.03s -> 21943.03s]  so is the plastic
[21943.03s -> 21945.03s]  on my keyboard but I'm not going to pop off
[21945.03s -> 21948.68s]  buttons and swallow them.
[21948.68s -> 21958.41s]  You know how much sugar is in Play-Doh?
[21958.41s -> 21970.70s]  Way too much.
[21970.70s -> 21972.70s]  Buy a keyboard made out of chocolate and eat it on the end of the screen.
[21972.70s -> 21975.96s]  That is actually kind of funny.
[21975.96s -> 21982.73s]  Whoa. This is a weird
[21982.73s -> 21995.59s]  looking monster. Let's shoot him.
[21995.59s -> 21997.90s]  Oh no. Let's just run into him.
[21997.90s -> 22005.83s]  But Play-Doh isn't gluten free.
[22005.83s -> 22010.12s]  Guys you're not supposed to be
[22010.12s -> 22012.12s]  eating Play-Doh. Who cares
[22012.12s -> 22014.12s]  what the nutritional content is.
[22014.12s -> 22022.57s]  It doesn't matter if Play-Doh is gluten free
[22022.57s -> 22024.57s]  or sugar free or
[22024.57s -> 22035.32s]  low sodium. Don't tell
[22035.32s -> 22039.86s]  me what to do. Yeah fine.
[22039.86s -> 22045.56s]  Don't tell me what to do. If I want to
[22045.56s -> 22047.56s]  eat my comedy cereal I'm going to eat it.
[22047.56s -> 22053.77s]  You're not our dad. You're not my dad.
[22053.77s -> 22071.80s]  Alright I got it. What
[22071.80s -> 22076.28s]  the hell?
[22076.28s -> 22080.12s]  Did I just stumble upon a boss?
[22080.12s -> 22084.78s]  Rawr. Whoa is he angry?
[22084.78s -> 22087.21s]  No no he's talking to us.
[22087.21s -> 22089.21s]  Please Fane leave this
[22089.21s -> 22091.38s]  to me. Are you the one using
[22091.38s -> 22093.38s]  the Geonite around here?
[22093.38s -> 22095.62s]  I've lived off Geonite for ages
[22095.62s -> 22097.62s]  rawr. But why
[22097.62s -> 22099.62s]  have you suddenly started using so much
[22099.62s -> 22101.99s]  Geonite?
[22101.99s -> 22103.99s]  The increased flow of Geonite woke
[22103.99s -> 22105.99s]  me up. Now I need lots of Geonite to stay
[22105.99s -> 22108.68s]  awake. But you're causing people
[22108.68s -> 22110.68s]  a lot of trouble. Please sleep once again. Go back to
[22110.68s -> 22112.68s]  bed. Rawr.
[22112.68s -> 22115.24s]  Never. Watch out.
[22115.24s -> 22119.91s]  Get back. Too much G
[22119.91s -> 22128.55s]  fuel. Um.
[22128.55s -> 22135.70s]  Okay.
[22135.70s -> 22140.12s]  That was a good hit.
[22140.12s -> 22143.90s]  King Shiden.
[22143.90s -> 22151.43s]  Shit.
[22151.43s -> 22157.26s]  Back it up. Do it again.
[22157.26s -> 22159.26s]  37%. Get it.
[22159.26s -> 22177.42s]  Good block. Come on.
[22177.42s -> 22179.42s]  You have 96 guts. Make this work.
[22179.42s -> 22182.94s]  Holy moly. Guts down.
[22182.94s -> 22189.02s]  Slow. Get killed.
[22189.02s -> 22191.51s]  137 damage.
[22191.51s -> 22194.58s]  Alright it's all up to you. You still
[22194.58s -> 22201.69s]  can't hit it. What? You alright?
[22201.69s -> 22207.05s]  Charge.
[22207.05s -> 22210.44s]  Get in there.
[22210.44s -> 22213.77s]  Alright. One more of those. That's it.
[22213.77s -> 22215.77s]  Come on Vroomer. 44% chance. Get it.
[22215.77s -> 22223.13s]  Yes. I win.
[22223.13s -> 22225.13s]  Only Vroomer gets the EXP unfortunately.
[22225.13s -> 22227.75s]  High speed ride.
[22227.75s -> 22229.75s]  And mastered 0
[22229.75s -> 22232.50s]  to 60. Nice.
[22232.50s -> 22238.52s]  You just killed an old
[22238.52s -> 22246.07s]  god. Alright.
[22246.07s -> 22250.04s]  I'm so sorry.
[22250.04s -> 22252.04s]  But please understand we need Geonite.
[22252.04s -> 22254.04s]  Therefore you have to die.
[22254.04s -> 22257.05s]  Humans use some Geonite.
[22257.05s -> 22259.48s]  Times have changed.
[22259.48s -> 22261.48s]  Young princess, it's been a long time.
[22261.48s -> 22264.10s]  I'll be good for your sake.
[22264.10s -> 22266.73s]  What? How do you know about me?
[22266.73s -> 22268.73s]  I guess we Raiden are your
[22268.73s -> 22271.29s]  friends. What do you mean?
[22273.78s -> 22276.09s]  Tell me.
[22276.09s -> 22278.09s]  Shoot he's asleep.
[22278.09s -> 22280.09s]  But at least now the flow of Geonite will return to normal.
[22280.09s -> 22283.10s]  Look near his feet.
[22283.10s -> 22286.62s]  Hmm. A huge pair of wings.
[22286.62s -> 22288.62s]  Are these his wings?
[22288.62s -> 22290.86s]  He said they are our friends.
[22290.86s -> 22292.86s]  Maybe these wings are to prove that.
[22292.86s -> 22297.40s]  The great Raiden are our
[22297.40s -> 22299.40s]  friends. Awesome. Let's go back to the
[22299.40s -> 22311.74s]  ranch. Who made
[22311.74s -> 22314.68s]  this game?
[22314.68s -> 22317.37s]  Who the fuck did it? Capcom, right?
[22317.37s -> 22320.57s]  Wally was injured. I'll send it to the
[22320.57s -> 22326.12s]  hospital. Uh oh.
[22326.12s -> 22328.12s]  Wally hasn't gotten better yet. I sure
[22328.12s -> 22330.12s]  hope it comes back soon.
[22330.12s -> 22337.78s]  Is anybody home? Yes.
[22337.78s -> 22339.78s]  Oh, Cynthia. Today I've come with a
[22339.78s -> 22342.34s]  delivery. A breeder
[22342.34s -> 22344.34s]  ranking card. We've earned rank
[22344.34s -> 22346.58s]  D. Yep.
[22346.58s -> 22348.58s]  Your efforts have earned an official ranking.
[22348.58s -> 22351.21s]  Congratulations. Thank you very much.
[22351.21s -> 22353.21s]  And also with the Geonite
[22353.21s -> 22355.21s]  shortage finally solved, official
[22355.21s -> 22357.21s]  battles will finally be starting again.
[22357.21s -> 22359.58s]  Well I'll be rooting for you.
[22359.58s -> 22361.82s]  Do your best. Yes, yes we will.
[22361.82s -> 22364.18s]  We'll do our very best.
[22364.18s -> 22375.18s]  Where's Wally?
[22380.42s -> 22384.33s]  Is he dead for real?
[22386.33s -> 22392.78s]  Okay.
[22392.78s -> 22394.78s]  Calendar?
[22394.78s -> 22396.78s]  Alright, rumor needs
[22396.78s -> 22398.78s]  another...
[22398.78s -> 22400.78s]  Unfortunately I had to miss
[22400.78s -> 22402.78s]  these because I can't join this yet.
[22402.78s -> 22406.62s]  And I have to sign up for this one.
[22406.62s -> 22408.62s]  Sign up for this one,
[22408.62s -> 22410.62s]  get ready for it, and then
[22412.79s -> 22414.79s]  also Roberto
[22414.79s -> 22416.79s]  needs to get ready for
[22416.79s -> 22418.79s]  one of these, this one, Banana.
[22424.86s -> 22427.10s]  Just let Wally die.
[22427.10s -> 22429.53s]  Let me take a look at
[22429.53s -> 22431.53s]  their data here. What do we need?
[22431.53s -> 22434.09s]  Roberto needs
[22434.09s -> 22436.52s]  um, accuracy.
[22436.52s -> 22438.52s]  Accuracy and life.
[22438.52s -> 22440.52s]  Rumor needs life
[22440.52s -> 22443.46s]  and either life, probably life
[22443.46s -> 22451.13s]  and defense.
[22451.13s -> 22453.13s]  Let's get you in the tub.
[22453.13s -> 22457.78s]  And then
[22457.78s -> 22459.78s]  get you with the blade in your
[22459.78s -> 22461.78s]  it's okay to click, oh no no no.
[22461.78s -> 22464.02s]  Do defense twice.
[22468.02s -> 22472.87s]  You...
[22472.87s -> 22474.87s]  What did I say for you?
[22474.87s -> 22477.62s]  It was defense, right?
[22479.62s -> 22481.62s]  No, it was life.
[22481.62s -> 22483.62s]  Do life twice.
[22487.02s -> 22491.82s]  Make another monster?
[22491.82s -> 22493.99s]  I could do that, yeah.
[22493.99s -> 22495.99s]  Wally sucks.
[22495.99s -> 22499.88s]  I'm gonna freeze Wally.
[22501.88s -> 22518.38s]  I mean, it's just the truth.
[22518.38s -> 22520.38s]  Here, have some food.
[22520.38s -> 22522.38s]  Have a banana.
[22522.38s -> 22527.37s]  Wally was good when he pierced shields.
[22527.37s -> 22529.37s]  Yeah, that's true.
[22529.37s -> 22534.62s]  But these two are way better.
[22534.62s -> 22540.06s]  Alright, hold on.
[22540.06s -> 22542.62s]  Silver coin.
[22542.62s -> 22545.43s]  I have so much of this stuff.
[22545.43s -> 22547.43s]  You want some cards?
[22547.43s -> 22550.50s]  I think Roberto hates battle cards.
[22550.50s -> 22552.50s]  It says I don't want it.
[22552.50s -> 22556.60s]  Yeah, right.
[22556.60s -> 22558.60s]  That's a nice cover.
[22558.60s -> 22565.32s]  You have every pack.
[22565.32s -> 22572.17s]  Alright, let's get back out here.
[22572.17s -> 22574.17s]  Check out Rumor's new...
[22574.17s -> 22576.17s]  I thought for some reason, I don't know why it said that.
[22576.17s -> 22578.17s]  I thought it said emote.
[22578.17s -> 22580.17s]  Check out Rumor's new emote.
[22580.17s -> 22585.80s]  What condiment would I choose
[22585.80s -> 22587.80s]  if I had to drink a liter of it in one sitting?
[22593.11s -> 22597.59s]  Probably like A1 steak sauce.
[22597.59s -> 22600.28s]  I feel like that wouldn't be that hard.
[22610.07s -> 22612.07s]  Let's go to the shrine.
[22612.07s -> 22619.82s]  Wally never came back.
[22619.82s -> 22621.82s]  Therefore, we're replacing him.
[22621.82s -> 22627.58s]  We can't.
[22627.58s -> 22630.90s]  I can't do anything.
[22630.90s -> 22632.90s]  Wally is in the hospital, but he still counts as a slut.
[22632.90s -> 22643.85s]  Freeze him in the hospital!
[22643.85s -> 22647.11s]  I don't think I can even do that.
[22647.11s -> 22655.82s]  Unplug him.
[22655.82s -> 22658.12s]  You guys are brutal.
[22658.12s -> 22660.49s]  Okay, training.
[22660.49s -> 22662.49s]  What's the schedule look like?
[22662.49s -> 22664.49s]  You have a tournament tomorrow,
[22664.49s -> 22666.49s]  so you're going to do light blade tonight,
[22666.49s -> 22668.49s]  and you're going to rest tomorrow.
[22668.49s -> 22670.49s]  You have a tournament later on in the week,
[22670.49s -> 22672.49s]  so you're going to do tub,
[22672.49s -> 22674.49s]  and then you're going to rest.
[22674.49s -> 22686.44s]  Get in.
[22686.44s -> 22688.74s]  Alright, you have to eat.
[22688.74s -> 22691.75s]  Oh fuck, I'm out of food.
[22691.75s -> 22695.72s]  I am out of food.
[22695.72s -> 22698.22s]  What happened to Wally?
[22698.22s -> 22701.03s]  Probably dead.
[22701.03s -> 22704.49s]  There's a possibility that Wally is dead.
[22704.49s -> 22713.96s]  He's been gone for a long time.
[22715.96s -> 22718.71s]  You don't have to eat right now.
[22722.62s -> 22724.62s]  I'm going to buy some stuff.
[22724.62s -> 22731.34s]  Crush Wally in a hydraulic press.
[22733.34s -> 22737.37s]  I swear,
[22737.37s -> 22739.37s]  some of you guys
[22739.37s -> 22741.37s]  have lost your minds.
[22741.37s -> 22743.37s]  What?
[22743.37s -> 22746.57s]  Why?
[22746.57s -> 22749.38s]  Let's get like five bananas.
[22749.38s -> 22751.99s]  Shitload of potatoes.
[22757.11s -> 22759.99s]  Okay.
[22759.99s -> 22764.09s]  I'm going to save my money.
[22764.09s -> 22766.90s]  Let's sell.
[22766.90s -> 22768.90s]  I have some new items here.
[22768.90s -> 22772.17s]  990 gold.
[22772.17s -> 22774.17s]  Yarn ball, battle cards,
[22774.17s -> 22776.17s]  silver coin, amethyst.
[22776.17s -> 22778.17s]  These are all worth...
[22778.17s -> 22789.62s]  I should just sell all this shit.
[22789.62s -> 22791.62s]  Bring Wally into a condiment and drink a gallon of it.
[22796.89s -> 22798.89s]  I'm going to tell your mother that you said that.
[22808.22s -> 22810.22s]  Slashman21's mom?
[22812.52s -> 22814.70s]  You see what your fucking son just wrote?
[22814.70s -> 22821.61s]  We all live in the same house.
[22845.08s -> 22847.08s]  Sleep.
[22847.08s -> 22849.08s]  Rest.
[22849.08s -> 22851.08s]  And you are also going to rest.
[22851.08s -> 22854.86s]  Look who's back.
[22854.86s -> 22858.31s]  You made it back. Welcome back.
[22858.31s -> 22867.21s]  Ship him off to the glue factory.
[22867.21s -> 22875.40s]  He has a terrible...
[22875.40s -> 22880.78s]  Alright, everyone's fine.
[22880.78s -> 22885.27s]  Let's get Roberto into the competition.
[22885.27s -> 22887.51s]  I want to get him up.
[22887.51s -> 22903.51s]  He's got to rank the fuck up, man.
[22903.51s -> 22905.51s]  And look, on the next stream, the next time we play this,
[22905.51s -> 22908.20s]  this is an audition.
[22908.20s -> 22914.86s]  Because whoever is the best
[22914.86s -> 22916.86s]  pretty much at the end of this stream
[22916.86s -> 22932.02s]  is the one that gets to move on.
[22932.02s -> 22940.39s]  What just happened?
[22940.39s -> 22942.39s]  Why did that... I couldn't... What?
[22947.58s -> 22950.65s]  He gave up.
[22950.65s -> 22952.65s]  He saw the wolf-gundam suit and he quit.
[22952.65s -> 22956.10s]  Why?
[22956.10s -> 22963.51s]  Alright, Decker.
[22963.51s -> 22966.65s]  117 damage. You ain't got shit.
[22966.65s -> 22968.65s]  I feel like this is the guy that would get to S-rank.
[22968.65s -> 22971.02s]  Super easily.
[22971.02s -> 22983.56s]  It was that easy.
[22983.56s -> 22989.38s]  Yeah, I bullied a bunch of rank-ees.
[22989.38s -> 22991.38s]  I did it.
[22991.38s -> 22996.44s]  800 bucks. And a banana.
[22996.44s -> 23007.70s]  You guys are fucking sadistic.
[23007.70s -> 23017.18s]  Somebody just said something fucking horrible.
[23017.18s -> 23019.18s]  Okay, what we got?
[23019.18s -> 23021.48s]  Begin training? Not yet.
[23021.48s -> 23023.48s]  So somebody else has a...
[23023.48s -> 23026.62s]  You have the final...
[23026.62s -> 23028.62s]  Is this right?
[23028.62s -> 23030.62s]  Hold on, let me see.
[23030.62s -> 23032.98s]  What's the calendar look like?
[23032.98s -> 23034.98s]  So you got...
[23034.98s -> 23036.98s]  This is the last...
[23036.98s -> 23039.22s]  No, where is it?
[23039.22s -> 23041.53s]  Okay.
[23041.53s -> 23043.53s]  So you got this one. If you beat this one,
[23043.53s -> 23045.53s]  then I can sign up for this one
[23045.53s -> 23047.53s]  and try to move on
[23047.53s -> 23049.53s]  to C-rank.
[23049.53s -> 23053.16s]  Good. So what do you need?
[23053.16s -> 23057.24s]  Life
[23057.24s -> 23062.09s]  and defense.
[23062.09s -> 23064.78s]  Let's do it.
[23064.78s -> 23066.95s]  Just do life twice.
[23066.95s -> 23069.77s]  Life, life, rest.
[23069.77s -> 23071.77s]  Sounds good.
[23071.77s -> 23073.77s]  You, on the other hand, you're gonna do...
[23073.77s -> 23075.94s]  You need like...
[23075.94s -> 23077.94s]  I don't have anything for intelligence, do I?
[23077.94s -> 23079.94s]  Just get your int up. Do it twice.
[23079.94s -> 23082.89s]  And you're gonna do...
[23082.89s -> 23084.89s]  Yeah, sandbag power is good.
[23084.89s -> 23086.89s]  And...
[23086.89s -> 23089.83s]  I also want...
[23089.83s -> 23093.22s]  Life. Get the tongue.
[23093.22s -> 23103.98s]  Pretty good session for everybody.
[23103.98s -> 23113.26s]  Probably should feed most people here.
[23115.26s -> 23127.91s]  All right.
[23127.91s -> 23129.91s]  Let's give everybody some potato.
[23134.97s -> 23136.97s]  What console is this on PlayStation 2?
[23136.97s -> 23144.12s]  PS2.
[23144.12s -> 23146.30s]  Are you hungry? Yes, you are.
[23146.30s -> 23148.30s]  You kind of had like a rough couple of days, so
[23148.30s -> 23161.03s]  I'll give you a banana. Are we all good to go?
[23161.03s -> 23163.98s]  Yes.
[23168.52s -> 23178.30s]  Oh, your whole schedule
[23178.30s -> 23180.30s]  is gone.
[23180.30s -> 23182.66s]  Okay, so you did meditation.
[23182.66s -> 23184.66s]  That's fine.
[23184.66s -> 23186.66s]  I'll change the schedule after this week.
[23186.66s -> 23188.66s]  So who else we got?
[23188.66s -> 23190.66s]  You're doing fine. You need to rest
[23190.66s -> 23192.66s]  anyways.
[23192.66s -> 23194.66s]  So you did life blade, rest.
[23194.66s -> 23196.84s]  Battle.
[23196.84s -> 23198.84s]  You are gonna do
[23198.84s -> 23200.84s]  hub, rest.
[23200.84s -> 23210.30s]  Yeah, let's go.
[23210.30s -> 23212.30s]  Pretty good increases all the way around,
[23212.30s -> 23214.30s]  except for maybe Roberto.
[23214.30s -> 23218.90s]  Jerma, I'm sorry I said you were
[23218.90s -> 23221.08s]  bad at Sekiro.
[23221.08s -> 23223.08s]  That's all right, as long as you apologized.
[23223.08s -> 23225.08s]  I accept your apology.
[23230.90s -> 23235.32s]  Lively. I just want you to
[23235.32s -> 23237.32s]  let you know that your mother loves you. Thanks, Mom.
[23237.32s -> 23243.34s]  All right, so you got something coming up here.
[23243.34s -> 23246.90s]  You're kind of all blue.
[23246.90s -> 23252.34s]  April Fools.
[23252.34s -> 23257.40s]  No!
[23257.40s -> 23261.18s]  Shit!
[23261.18s -> 23263.18s]  No, I had that queued up already.
[23267.77s -> 23269.77s]  All right.
[23269.77s -> 23271.77s]  Take a banana
[23271.77s -> 23274.39s]  or potato.
[23274.39s -> 23276.39s]  Let's do this last tournament, and then
[23276.39s -> 23282.92s]  bring you to rank C.
[23282.92s -> 23286.44s]  I think you have new stuff.
[23286.44s -> 23289.13s]  All right, so we got
[23289.13s -> 23291.82s]  this is 0 to 60.
[23291.82s -> 23293.82s]  Accuracy rate is B.
[23293.82s -> 23296.63s]  That's pretty decent.
[23296.63s -> 23298.63s]  Pretty decent crit damage, too.
[23298.63s -> 23302.79s]  I already have these on.
[23302.79s -> 23304.79s]  It's drifting.
[23304.79s -> 23306.79s]  All right, so 0 to 60.
[23306.79s -> 23308.79s]  What's the difference between this
[23308.79s -> 23310.79s]  and...
[23310.79s -> 23313.66s]  Let's see.
[23313.66s -> 23315.66s]  Life damage B, life damage C.
[23315.66s -> 23317.66s]  So this is better.
[23317.66s -> 23319.66s]  No, I have worse damage.
[23319.66s -> 23321.66s]  It's way more accurate, though.
[23324.15s -> 23326.15s]  Yeah, I would do this way more.
[23326.15s -> 23328.15s]  Holy shit, look at that.
[23328.15s -> 23331.22s]  It costs 40 guts to do this.
[23331.22s -> 23333.22s]  It's got a really good hit rate, but
[23333.22s -> 23338.54s]  that's a lot.
[23338.54s -> 23340.54s]  What do you do? You got something else to do.
[23340.54s -> 23342.90s]  High speed ride
[23342.90s -> 23344.90s]  lets you ride your monster at high speed
[23344.90s -> 23349.90s]  in order to avoid enemies.
[23349.90s -> 23361.14s]  How does that mean? Okay, anybody hungry?
[23361.14s -> 23364.79s]  All right, tournament time.
[23366.79s -> 23371.85s]  It's a passive or something,
[23371.85s -> 23374.54s]  somehow.
[23374.54s -> 23381.38s]  It's some kind of passive.
[23381.38s -> 23383.38s]  We're presenting the cup.
[23383.38s -> 23386.18s]  Who will rise?
[23386.18s -> 23388.18s]  It's the same dialogue every time.
[23388.18s -> 23390.18s]  All right, Pokey, Poke,
[23390.18s -> 23392.18s]  Jurl, and Cage.
[23392.18s -> 23396.14s]  Cage.
[23396.14s -> 23398.14s]  158 power, 147 defense.
[23398.14s -> 23400.14s]  You're a chump and will kill you
[23400.14s -> 23402.14s]  very easily to a point where
[23402.14s -> 23404.63s]  it is going to be...
[23404.63s -> 23409.30s]  Yeah, see you later.
[23409.30s -> 23416.47s]  I didn't even need to embarrass him.
[23416.47s -> 23419.29s]  Everybody's just afraid of me.
[23419.29s -> 23422.55s]  All right, this is Jurl.
[23422.55s -> 23424.55s]  Pretty good.
[23424.55s -> 23426.55s]  177, 172,
[23426.55s -> 23429.30s]  155, 151.
[23429.30s -> 23431.30s]  Not that strong with melee though.
[23431.30s -> 23433.67s]  All right, so you got a lot of...
[23433.67s -> 23435.67s]  Okay, I gotta be wary of your...
[23435.67s -> 23445.85s]  Why would I...
[23445.85s -> 23448.02s]  Why even...
[23448.02s -> 23451.42s]  Are they just going to give me the trophy for sitting on the bench?
[23451.42s -> 23454.49s]  Pokey, Pokey
[23454.49s -> 23459.48s]  is awful.
[23459.48s -> 23463.64s]  All right, at least Pokey Pokey is going to actually fight me.
[23463.64s -> 23465.64s]  He has the worst stats.
[23465.64s -> 23469.48s]  Pokey Pokey had the worst stats out of all of them.
[23469.48s -> 23476.39s]  The bravest, apparently.
[23476.39s -> 23481.13s]  Nasty!
[23481.13s -> 23485.67s]  All right, well, that was cute.
[23485.67s -> 23488.68s]  Back it up. Fine.
[23488.68s -> 23490.68s]  All right, don't get cocky here.
[23490.68s -> 23494.26s]  Okay, they were going to hand me the trophy and now I gotta be careful.
[23494.26s -> 23496.26s]  Just don't fucking let up.
[23496.26s -> 23498.70s]  Drift into the charge.
[23498.70s -> 23504.26s]  18 damage, that's it.
[23504.26s -> 23507.90s]  Pokey better not win.
[23507.90s -> 23509.90s]  Just do the drum again.
[23509.90s -> 23521.29s]  He's too unsusceptible to it, it's over.
[23521.29s -> 23524.42s]  All right, time to get out of this rank.
[23524.42s -> 23532.49s]  Almost died to Pokey Pokey.
[23532.49s -> 23534.49s]  That's the real question.
[23534.49s -> 23536.49s]  Only three fame, people are getting annoyed
[23536.49s -> 23538.49s]  at how easy this is for him, apparently.
[23538.49s -> 23540.79s]  Are you in a garbage
[23540.79s -> 23542.79s]  elo? Not for long.
[23542.79s -> 23551.24s]  Smurfing and almost losing.
[23551.24s -> 23553.24s]  Yeah, how many times have you guys been smurfing?
[23553.24s -> 23555.24s]  And you have to answer the phone or something
[23555.24s -> 23558.12s]  and you're playing with one hand.
[23558.12s -> 23560.12s]  Okay.
[23560.12s -> 23562.12s]  This is
[23562.12s -> 23564.12s]  who is in this one this week.
[23564.12s -> 23566.12s]  Let's get Roberto in here.
[23566.12s -> 23569.83s]  Because we gotta
[23569.83s -> 23573.86s]  start bringing people up.
[23573.86s -> 23577.90s]  Sandbag.
[23577.90s -> 23579.90s]  No, just, yeah, just do it.
[23579.90s -> 23585.53s]  Fuck it, do it, he's gonna win.
[23585.53s -> 23593.53s]  What are you gonna do this week?
[23593.53s -> 23601.19s]  Target, right, okay.
[23601.19s -> 23603.19s]  When are you gonna fuse, Wally?
[23603.19s -> 23608.81s]  I don't think I'm gonna.
[23608.81s -> 23615.14s]  So now you're ready to go to the
[23615.14s -> 23617.58s]  final tournament.
[23617.58s -> 23619.58s]  Hopefully I win that tournament.
[23619.58s -> 23621.58s]  Usually the official tournament's a no joke.
[23621.58s -> 23625.42s]  All right, you're okay, just eat. I'll give you something good.
[23625.42s -> 23627.42s]  You have a squid.
[23632.69s -> 23640.05s]  Proceed to the weekend activities, yes.
[23640.05s -> 23642.80s]  Let's pull
[23642.80s -> 23644.80s]  you out here.
[23644.80s -> 23647.04s]  Get him to D-rank.
[23647.04s -> 23651.52s]  I heard you're gonna propose to Kim tomorrow
[23651.52s -> 23653.52s]  and then pepper spray her for April Fool's Day.
[23653.52s -> 23657.87s]  Well, I don't know where
[23657.87s -> 23659.87s]  you heard that from. That's a
[23659.87s -> 23661.87s]  very odd thing to hear.
[23661.87s -> 23667.06s]  All right, Donna, a kubilik
[23667.06s -> 23669.06s]  inchara. Let's just, I don't even need to
[23669.06s -> 23671.30s]  see what they do. I'm gonna
[23671.30s -> 23680.51s]  insta-kill this person. Donna's the toothpaste.
[23680.51s -> 23684.35s]  I'm gonna go
[23684.35s -> 23686.35s]  level slash instant kill.
[23686.35s -> 23691.22s]  Well, would've been.
[23691.22s -> 23695.25s]  All right, well, if you would
[23695.25s -> 23697.25s]  not be so timid.
[23697.25s -> 23701.28s]  Good slice. Again.
[23701.28s -> 23712.99s]  These are, it's only
[23712.99s -> 23714.99s]  two matches, so it's easy. I like to do these.
[23714.99s -> 23717.36s]  For these low level ones, I should not
[23717.36s -> 23719.36s]  be doing the ones that have
[23719.36s -> 23721.36s]  four matches or three matches at least.
[23721.36s -> 23736.27s]  Just the ones with two. We already saw
[23736.27s -> 23747.54s]  you before. Didn't even get a chance.
[23747.54s -> 23753.42s]  Now we can pull him out of this
[23753.42s -> 23755.42s]  rank. And we're gonna do the same thing. I'm getting
[23755.42s -> 23757.42s]  right to see. I feel like he should be there.
[23757.42s -> 23767.09s]  Butter crunch ice cream is underrated. Butter crunch
[23767.09s -> 23772.40s]  ice cream is amazing. People say
[23772.40s -> 23774.40s]  butter pecan, but no. Get the pecans out of there.
[23774.40s -> 23781.06s]  Butter crunch is butter pecan ice cream,
[23781.06s -> 23783.30s]  but no pecans.
[23783.30s -> 23786.82s]  How are things? Need anything today?
[23786.82s -> 23789.12s]  Go ahead. Take a look around. What will
[23789.12s -> 23791.12s]  you do? All right. What do we got?
[23791.12s -> 23797.26s]  Effect.
[23797.26s -> 23799.26s]  Got any more training gadgets I can buy?
[23799.26s -> 23801.63s]  I already have this.
[23801.63s -> 23803.63s]  Tub, trampoline,
[23803.63s -> 23805.63s]  target, book.
[23805.63s -> 23807.63s]  That's the one thing I do not have.
[23813.89s -> 23817.60s]  Shit. It's one by two?
[23821.60s -> 23824.29s]  I have enough room, don't I?
[23824.29s -> 23826.29s]  How's that not enough room?
[23837.31s -> 23839.31s]  Trampoline. Which one's not gonna be used?
[23841.31s -> 23844.19s]  Oh, seven out of seven.
[23844.19s -> 23846.19s]  Oh.
[23846.19s -> 23848.19s]  This thing is so huge.
[23850.56s -> 23852.56s]  I wonder which one
[23852.56s -> 23855.57s]  I should get rid of.
[23863.06s -> 23865.06s]  Maybe the speed for now.
[23865.06s -> 23868.32s]  Just put it away.
[23878.46s -> 23880.77s]  I got everything.
[23880.77s -> 23883.33s]  I don't know.
[23883.33s -> 23885.33s]  No appraisal?
[23885.33s -> 23887.70s]  No.
[23887.70s -> 23891.34s]  Leveling intelligence.
[23891.34s -> 23893.34s]  Yeah. One of the
[23893.34s -> 23895.34s]  monsters I have is an int-based
[23895.34s -> 23898.86s]  Walle is an
[23898.86s -> 23903.02s]  intelligence-based monster.
[23903.02s -> 23905.02s]  Let's queue up some shit.
[23905.02s -> 23907.02s]  Calendar.
[23907.02s -> 23909.02s]  All right.
[23909.02s -> 23911.02s]  Here you go. Roberto.
[23911.02s -> 23913.02s]  Official tournament. Sign up for it.
[23913.02s -> 23915.02s]  And then the next
[23915.02s -> 23917.02s]  day official tournament for Vroomer.
[23917.02s -> 23919.02s]  And then Walle, who cares?
[23919.02s -> 23921.02s]  I guess Walle could do this one right here
[23921.02s -> 23923.02s]  just to get ready.
[23923.02s -> 23925.84s]  No, I want them to train.
[23925.84s -> 23927.84s]  Walle, you do this one.
[23933.41s -> 23935.41s]  Walle, go read the book.
[23935.41s -> 23937.41s]  Sorry, I wanted you to, yeah. Rest.
[23937.41s -> 23939.41s]  Tub. Tub.
[23939.41s -> 23941.97s]  Rest.
[23941.97s -> 23943.97s]  Lifeblade. Lifeblade.
[23943.97s -> 23946.21s]  Good.
[23946.21s -> 23948.21s]  Book.
[23948.21s -> 23951.02s]  Book.
[23953.02s -> 23957.17s]  Rest.
[23957.17s -> 23959.54s]  And then probably
[23959.54s -> 23961.54s]  Lifeblade.
[23961.54s -> 23963.90s]  You.
[23963.90s -> 23965.90s]  Rest. Lifeblade. Lifeblade.
[23965.90s -> 23968.14s]  Rest. Sandbag.
[23968.14s -> 23971.78s]  No.
[23971.78s -> 23973.78s]  Yeah. Sandbag. Tub. Rest.
[23973.78s -> 23984.51s]  Good to go.
[23984.51s -> 23995.46s]  You can actually read the book. You're so cute.
[23995.46s -> 23999.87s]  Hungry too. Here, come here.
[24002.69s -> 24009.78s]  He's learning.
[24009.78s -> 24011.78s]  His intelligence moves, the
[24011.78s -> 24013.78s]  green moves are the ones that are based on him.
[24013.78s -> 24016.14s]  The more intelligence you have, the more
[24016.14s -> 24018.51s]  damage those moves will do.
[24018.51s -> 24022.35s]  You understand?
[24029.31s -> 24032.70s]  Get in the tub.
[24032.70s -> 24035.07s]  You can rest. No, why?
[24035.07s -> 24037.07s]  You're fine. No, book.
[24037.07s -> 24039.07s]  Book. Double Lifeblade.
[24039.07s -> 24041.07s]  Sounds good to me.
[24041.07s -> 24048.93s]  Nice. After this,
[24048.93s -> 24050.93s]  we're gonna start to do, we're gonna hammer a tournament.
[24050.93s -> 24057.90s]  Frustrated. Oh, no.
[24057.90s -> 24059.90s]  Having trouble with the reading?
[24059.90s -> 24062.85s]  You're just doing okay.
[24062.85s -> 24064.85s]  Let's tell you you're doing a good job.
[24064.85s -> 24078.98s]  I have squid too.
[24078.98s -> 24080.98s]  Alright.
[24080.98s -> 24082.98s]  I gotta get one of these guys
[24082.98s -> 24084.98s]  to like ranks B or A.
[24084.98s -> 24088.05s]  Before they die.
[24088.05s -> 24093.94s]  He's gonna die soon.
[24093.94s -> 24103.92s]  Alright. Tub.
[24103.92s -> 24106.99s]  Frustrated. Have a rest.
[24106.99s -> 24108.99s]  Lifeblade. Rest. Good.
[24108.99s -> 24115.01s]  Just go.
[24115.01s -> 24123.01s]  That was a good amount.
[24123.01s -> 24125.01s]  Yeah, I'm gonna hammer tournaments here.
[24125.01s -> 24130.38s]  I should be able to jump up like two ranks
[24130.38s -> 24132.38s]  real quick. Just do three tournaments
[24132.38s -> 24138.66s]  and four tournaments in a row and win them all.
[24138.66s -> 24140.66s]  Summer. Week four.
[24140.66s -> 24143.22s]  Alright.
[24143.22s -> 24145.52s]  You guys are hungry now.
[24145.52s -> 24148.59s]  You can rest.
[24148.59s -> 24152.75s]  I'll feed you guys all in a minute here.
[24152.75s -> 24162.93s]  Feeding time.
[24162.93s -> 24166.83s]  Here you go.
[24166.83s -> 24169.58s]  No, no. Food.
[24169.58s -> 24175.34s]  Your favorite.
[24175.34s -> 24178.29s]  What a good boy.
[24178.29s -> 24182.45s]  You...
[24182.45s -> 24184.45s]  You're okay.
[24184.45s -> 24188.35s]  You gotta sleep?
[24188.35s -> 24190.35s]  Have a good night? Yeah, it's getting late.
[24190.35s -> 24192.59s]  We'll probably call it here in a little bit.
[24192.59s -> 24196.18s]  After another tournament or two.
[24196.18s -> 24199.50s]  It is getting late.
[24199.50s -> 24210.06s]  It's getting to be just about 2am eastern.
[24210.06s -> 24212.69s]  We will call it fairly soon here.
[24212.69s -> 24224.21s]  I at least want to rank up
[24224.21s -> 24228.50s]  two people. We're gonna start doing that now.
[24228.50s -> 24230.86s]  So this is the
[24230.86s -> 24232.86s]  tournament for Wally.
[24232.86s -> 24243.92s]  Hopefully we can bring Wally up.
[24243.92s -> 24245.92s]  A nice life increase for
[24245.92s -> 24248.80s]  Broomer. That's good.
[24248.80s -> 24250.80s]  I think everyone's good to go. Fight with Wally.
[24250.80s -> 24254.05s]  Yeah, you're good.
[24254.05s -> 24256.54s]  Good. Good.
[24256.54s -> 24262.93s]  Yeah, after
[24262.93s -> 24264.93s]  these tournaments, we'll call it a night.
[24264.93s -> 24270.82s]  And then I think I might...
[24270.82s -> 24276.50s]  I think I might get rid of Wally.
[24276.50s -> 24278.50s]  I'm not sure he's too...
[24278.50s -> 24280.50s]  He's great fusing.
[24280.50s -> 24283.12s]  I would fuse Wally with somebody else.
[24283.12s -> 24286.06s]  I'm gonna have to make somebody else.
[24286.06s -> 24290.48s]  Wally versus Yellow.
[24290.48s -> 24292.48s]  This is an intelligence-based
[24292.48s -> 24294.48s]  enemy. That's fine.
[24294.48s -> 24308.11s]  Wally's really cute, but
[24308.11s -> 24312.78s]  we'll see. If he won, he kills
[24312.78s -> 24316.24s]  this guy, maybe. Oh, Wally hasn't
[24316.24s -> 24318.24s]  moved, too.
[24318.24s -> 24334.61s]  Look at that damage.
[24334.61s -> 24336.61s]  It's like 48.
[24336.61s -> 24339.42s]  We used to see in numbers over 100.
[24339.42s -> 24343.97s]  Gatty's terrible.
[24343.97s -> 24349.22s]  This Gatty would probably give up. No.
[24349.22s -> 24352.74s]  This is really high defense. Maybe it's
[24352.74s -> 24354.74s]  good to keep him around. I wish you could unfreeze.
[24354.74s -> 24357.68s]  Because
[24357.68s -> 24359.68s]  he just has really high defense.
[24359.68s -> 24371.18s]  47.
[24371.18s -> 24373.62s]  How about the gun?
[24373.62s -> 24377.39s]  31%.
[24377.39s -> 24380.34s]  47.
[24380.34s -> 24391.09s]  I mean, this thing has the highest hit percentage.
[24391.09s -> 24393.09s]  It doesn't do very... 34
[24393.09s -> 24395.09s]  damage. Wally, come on. You're really starting to
[24395.09s -> 24397.09s]  get cold
[24397.09s -> 24407.14s]  here. And I do mean that
[24407.14s -> 24411.42s]  very, very literally.
[24411.42s -> 24413.42s]  This is the dog, right?
[24413.42s -> 24415.92s]  This dog is stuck
[24415.92s -> 24419.17s]  in, like,
[24419.17s -> 24427.23s]  wood. You know, they're like,
[24427.23s -> 24429.23s]  oh, bronze, silver. No, this isn't
[24429.23s -> 24432.37s]  your wood. How come they don't do that
[24432.37s -> 24434.37s]  shit? Why is it not wood
[24434.37s -> 24436.37s]  cloth? Cloth, wood,
[24436.37s -> 24439.38s]  stone, bronze.
[24439.38s -> 24441.74s]  That's what it should be.
[24441.74s -> 24443.74s]  Oh, god. Joel just came in with a raid.
[24443.74s -> 24446.75s]  What's going on, guys?
[24446.75s -> 24450.96s]  Thank you, Joel.
[24450.96s -> 24452.96s]  We are currently playing
[24452.96s -> 24457.82s]  Monster Rancher 4. Hope you had a
[24457.82s -> 24459.82s]  good stream. I don't know what we were doing earlier.
[24459.82s -> 24462.64s]  What was Joel just streaming?
[24462.64s -> 24473.70s]  Shitposts?
[24473.70s -> 24477.98s]  A microphone game.
[24477.98s -> 24480.35s]  Well, welcome or drop. Thanks a lot again,
[24480.35s -> 24484.45s]  Joel for the raid.
[24484.45s -> 24486.45s]  It's going to be hard for me to explain what the hell is going on on the screen here.
[24486.45s -> 24488.45s]  But, if you're
[24488.45s -> 24490.45s]  familiar with Monster Rancher,
[24490.45s -> 24493.14s]  you breed monsters and you fight them
[24493.14s -> 24495.14s]  and then you miss
[24495.14s -> 24497.14s]  five to ten times in a row of your moves, because they're only
[24497.14s -> 24499.14s]  at a 27%.
[24499.14s -> 24501.14s]  And then it gets even worse, because now I'm going to
[24501.14s -> 24503.14s]  be at about, yeah, 12%.
[24503.14s -> 24508.83s]  Eventually, I will kill this.
[24508.83s -> 24510.83s]  Or I won't.
[24510.83s -> 24512.83s]  We're actually about to turn this
[24512.83s -> 24514.83s]  monster into
[24514.83s -> 24516.83s]  into Gruul.
[24516.83s -> 24518.83s]  We're going to grind him down and use him as DNA.
[24518.83s -> 24520.83s]  Because he's really proving right now
[24520.83s -> 24522.83s]  just why he
[24522.83s -> 24524.83s]  shouldn't be on the roster.
[24524.83s -> 24526.83s]  He's very cute, though.
[24526.83s -> 24533.68s]  Yeah, they made five of these
[24533.68s -> 24535.68s]  games for console.
[24535.68s -> 24537.68s]  And they made like three for DS.
[24537.68s -> 24544.02s]  And like two for Game Boy Advance.
[24544.02s -> 24546.02s]  Can you do anything? Come on.
[24546.02s -> 24548.02s]  I was just pressing
[24548.02s -> 24550.51s]  L1 right there.
[24550.51s -> 24552.51s]  Because I was really hopeful that I could bring in
[24552.51s -> 24555.52s]  one of my other teammates.
[24555.52s -> 24557.52s]  This is E rank. This is fucking Wood League.
[24557.52s -> 24559.52s]  This is a bad indicator, guys.
[24561.95s -> 24563.95s]  I was killing enemies in one hit
[24563.95s -> 24568.30s]  with the other people.
[24568.30s -> 24570.30s]  And that dog didn't even do anything. Didn't even attack.
[24570.30s -> 24581.81s]  I still won.
[24581.81s -> 24585.65s]  Grind him up. He already has D. Good stats.
[24585.65s -> 24588.08s]  I don't know. What is it?
[24588.08s -> 24592.37s]  Accuracy is just terrible.
[24592.37s -> 24594.37s]  Eight fame's not bad. See, the game can hear
[24594.37s -> 24604.67s]  you guys talking.
[24604.67s -> 24606.67s]  He won all those fights, but he still sucks. Yeah, but he does
[24606.67s -> 24608.85s]  still suck. He's really cute
[24608.85s -> 24610.85s]  and he's really funny and really cool, but he
[24610.85s -> 24612.85s]  doesn't hold a candle to either one of these two.
[24612.85s -> 24615.98s]  Like, watch.
[24615.98s -> 24617.98s]  Take a look at this. Ready?
[24617.98s -> 24620.42s]  Well, not today, but tomorrow.
[24620.42s -> 24622.42s]  Meditation. I thought everyone's good to go.
[24622.42s -> 24624.42s]  I'm kind of tired, but you really need to keep...
[24624.42s -> 24626.42s]  You can rest tomorrow.
[24626.42s -> 24629.87s]  This is Roberto has his tournament.
[24629.87s -> 24631.87s]  This is a rank-up tournament, I think, isn't it?
[24631.87s -> 24634.30s]  These both are rank-up tournaments.
[24634.30s -> 24636.30s]  They gotta be both great.
[24636.30s -> 24645.90s]  Look at those terrible... those bad increases, too.
[24645.90s -> 24648.14s]  Your siblings are doing
[24648.14s -> 24650.38s]  way better than you.
[24650.38s -> 24653.46s]  I'm gonna go skull them. Only one way.
[24653.46s -> 24656.72s]  I've been spoiling them too much.
[24656.72s -> 24665.49s]  No. Alright. No.
[24665.49s -> 24667.49s]  Let me say... I'll be happy. I'll be nice.
[24667.49s -> 24669.49s]  Tenta, thanks for five community subs, Tenta.
[24669.49s -> 24673.01s]  Tenta coming in with five subs.
[24673.01s -> 24676.14s]  Thank you.
[24676.14s -> 24679.07s]  You need to eat.
[24679.07s -> 24681.31s]  Have a potato.
[24681.31s -> 24684.26s]  They won't learn
[24684.26s -> 24686.26s]  if you are kind.
[24686.26s -> 24688.56s]  I've been pretty harsh.
[24688.56s -> 24693.60s]  You've seen me be harsh.
[24693.60s -> 24705.87s]  Alright, here we go.
[24705.87s -> 24707.87s]  Weekends, activities.
[24707.87s -> 24709.87s]  Uh, it's tomorrow.
[24709.87s -> 24712.50s]  Yep.
[24712.50s -> 24714.50s]  No competitions are scheduled this week. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24714.50s -> 24716.74s]  Wait, hold on.
[24716.74s -> 24719.87s]  Oh, alright.
[24719.87s -> 24721.87s]  It's here and then here, right? Okay.
[24721.87s -> 24724.74s]  Don't scold Wally yet
[24724.74s -> 24731.07s]  since he just won. That's true.
[24733.07s -> 24735.07s]  So now we have...
[24735.07s -> 24737.07s]  You were planning on resting today,
[24737.07s -> 24739.07s]  but I think I'll rest you tomorrow.
[24741.07s -> 24743.44s]  What do you need?
[24745.44s -> 24747.44s]  Lifeblade.
[24747.44s -> 24749.44s]  You...
[24749.44s -> 24752.18s]  You can rest.
[24752.18s -> 24754.61s]  You... it's your tournament, so you rest, too.
[24754.61s -> 24756.61s]  Yeah.
[24756.61s -> 24758.61s]  And then we'll give you...
[24758.61s -> 24760.61s]  We'll give you a good encouragement before you battle.
[24760.61s -> 24765.79s]  Nice.
[24765.79s -> 24772.83s]  German blocked Joel in fear of the message...
[24772.83s -> 24778.53s]  Wait, what?
[24778.53s -> 24781.09s]  Prostrated? That's not good.
[24781.09s -> 24785.63s]  Well, you can relax tomorrow. You don't have to do anything.
[24785.63s -> 24787.63s]  I didn't see it. I didn't see... What did he write?
[24787.63s -> 24789.63s]  Alright, you're good. Lively focused. You're good to go.
[24789.63s -> 24793.98s]  Let's go stomp the E-Ring.
[24797.38s -> 24799.38s]  This is an official grade E competition.
[24799.38s -> 24806.67s]  We should do this fairly easily.
[24806.67s -> 24809.68s]  Why am I playing Neopets?
[24809.68s -> 24812.82s]  You don't know what...
[24812.82s -> 24814.82s]  If you don't know what Monster Rancher is...
[24814.82s -> 24817.63s]  Neopets is like a...
[24817.63s -> 24819.63s]  A JPG game.
[24819.63s -> 24822.06s]  This is real animations on the screen.
[24822.06s -> 24824.24s]  You don't just...
[24824.24s -> 24826.67s]  Watch your character load as a picture on the screen.
[24826.67s -> 24833.71s]  My Neopet hasn't been fed in 10 years.
[24835.71s -> 24838.34s]  Well, that's on you.
[24838.34s -> 24840.34s]  Alright, we know all these people already.
[24840.34s -> 24842.34s]  Sunny is pretty strong.
[24842.34s -> 24844.34s]  But not as strong as Roberto.
[24844.34s -> 24846.70s]  I would assume half these people are going to give up.
[24846.70s -> 24853.68s]  I'm going to go with Double Slash.
[24853.68s -> 24857.71s]  Yeah, we've seen this before.
[24857.71s -> 24859.71s]  We've battled this before.
[24859.71s -> 24861.71s]  Watch this.
[24861.71s -> 24865.17s]  Goodbye.
[24865.17s -> 24867.17s]  You guys want to keep Roberto? No, no.
[24867.17s -> 24869.17s]  You guys want to keep...
[24869.17s -> 24871.92s]  Oh, what's that? Instantly death.
[24871.92s -> 24874.48s]  I don't have like a jokey fucking glove
[24874.48s -> 24876.48s]  come out of my clam.
[24876.48s -> 24878.72s]  And hit seven times in a row.
[24878.72s -> 24880.72s]  No. We just steamroll.
[24880.72s -> 24892.56s]  He loves you though.
[24892.56s -> 24894.56s]  Yeah, but we only have three slots.
[24894.56s -> 24896.56s]  And you can't unfreeze people.
[24896.56s -> 24899.44s]  In Monster Rancher IV
[24899.44s -> 24902.19s]  you cannot bring them back.
[24902.19s -> 24904.19s]  You can only retire them forever.
[24904.19s -> 24908.54s]  And then use them as DNA.
[24908.54s -> 24912.38s]  I don't have to look at these.
[24912.38s -> 24914.38s]  We do Double Slash into Side Slash.
[24914.38s -> 24920.77s]  And that's it.
[24920.77s -> 24924.16s]  Let the other two just carry him.
[24924.16s -> 24928.51s]  I mean, I could.
[24928.51s -> 24935.49s]  He's dead. One hit.
[24935.49s -> 24937.79s]  I don't even need to see their stats.
[24937.79s -> 24945.92s]  He's too good.
[24945.92s -> 24950.85s]  Oh, your opponent quit, by the way.
[24950.85s -> 24964.48s]  Oh, who knew?
[24964.48s -> 24966.48s]  Yeah, that the Transformer was a...
[24966.48s -> 24975.63s]  was going to be the best one.
[24975.63s -> 24977.63s]  You getting cocky? Cocky streamer?
[24977.63s -> 24983.46s]  Kind of. But I think it's worth being
[24983.46s -> 24985.46s]  cocky here, because...
[24985.46s -> 24996.14s]  I mean, seriously.
[24996.14s -> 24998.64s]  I just don't belong in this rank.
[24998.64s -> 25000.64s]  I gotta get up to D and C with
[25000.64s -> 25002.64s]  Roberto. This is way better than everybody here.
[25002.64s -> 25006.99s]  Is it Roberto of rank?
[25006.99s -> 25008.99s]  No. Rumor is rank D.
[25008.99s -> 25010.99s]  About to attempt to go to rank C.
[25010.99s -> 25014.45s]  I think I already win.
[25014.45s -> 25017.90s]  Yeah, there's no way anybody can come back.
[25017.90s -> 25019.90s]  I just have to win to beat Harris.
[25019.90s -> 25024.00s]  Alright, if I don't one hit kill
[25024.00s -> 25026.00s]  Harris, I will give 5,000 community subs.
[25026.00s -> 25035.28s]  I'm kidding.
[25035.28s -> 25037.28s]  I'm kidding. That's a joke, by the way.
[25037.28s -> 25041.38s]  Technically didn't hit him yet.
[25041.38s -> 25043.38s]  Technically didn't hit him.
[25043.38s -> 25045.38s]  I swung, but I missed one hit.
[25045.38s -> 25048.83s]  Technically didn't hit him.
[25048.83s -> 25055.55s]  Didn't hit him.
[25055.55s -> 25061.50s]  I have to hit him. Alright, that's...
[25061.50s -> 25067.46s]  I told you it was a joke already.
[25067.46s -> 25069.46s]  I told you immediately it was a joke.
[25069.46s -> 25071.63s]  I can't do that.
[25071.63s -> 25074.77s]  I'll go to jail if I do that.
[25074.77s -> 25076.77s]  By the way, April Fools.
[25076.77s -> 25080.16s]  You believed it? Unbelievable.
[25080.16s -> 25083.23s]  April Fools.
[25083.23s -> 25085.23s]  You know those things that people say
[25085.23s -> 25087.23s]  on April Fools and it's like, whoa, what the fuck?
[25087.23s -> 25089.23s]  Is that real? Is that shit real?
[25089.23s -> 25091.23s]  Nope. Not today.
[25091.23s -> 25093.23s]  Not on this special day.
[25093.23s -> 25095.23s]  I can say whatever I want. I can tell you.
[25095.23s -> 25097.23s]  Hey, I'm like 6'2". April fucking Fools.
[25097.23s -> 25099.23s]  I can say whatever I want. Today is the day where you can say anything you want.
[25099.23s -> 25104.93s]  You already did a joke.
[25104.93s -> 25116.58s]  I ate a cereal I like.
[25119.78s -> 25123.36s]  Dude, you guys understand how much that is.
[25123.36s -> 25125.36s]  The comedy cereal was not April Fools.
[25125.36s -> 25128.24s]  It was just comedy cereal.
[25128.24s -> 25130.24s]  I just said as an April Fools joke,
[25130.24s -> 25132.24s]  I'm gonna give 5,000 community subs if I don't one hit this person.
[25132.24s -> 25134.24s]  It was an April Fools gag.
[25134.24s -> 25137.38s]  It's 25,000 dollars.
[25144.86s -> 25151.39s]  25,000 dollars.
[25151.39s -> 25157.73s]  Holy fuck.
[25157.73s -> 25160.74s]  Yeah, I get to have...
[25160.74s -> 25162.74s]  I get to have my April Fools joke.
[25162.74s -> 25164.74s]  That's what it was.
[25164.74s -> 25166.98s]  Thank god this is today.
[25166.98s -> 25168.98s]  Thank god it's like April Fools everywhere in the world right now.
[25168.98s -> 25170.98s]  Because that's my excuse.
[25170.98s -> 25172.98s]  And it's a good one.
[25172.98s -> 25174.98s]  If this was any other day.
[25174.98s -> 25178.94s]  It's the fucking liar day.
[25178.94s -> 25185.86s]  You need to press.
[25189.95s -> 25192.58s]  It's 11pm for me.
[25192.58s -> 25194.58s]  I'm speaking to you. It's midnight for you.
[25203.79s -> 25207.31s]  Why did I even say that?
[25207.31s -> 25209.31s]  I know it was like I was doing an April Fools thing but...
[25209.31s -> 25211.68s]  I'm not fucking doing that.
[25211.68s -> 25213.68s]  Are you kidding me?
[25213.68s -> 25215.86s]  That would like ruin me.
[25215.86s -> 25232.80s]  Constellation prize?
[25232.80s -> 25234.80s]  Alright, fine. I'll play Minecraft VR for like 30 minutes.
[25234.80s -> 25237.55s]  In like a week or two.
[25237.55s -> 25255.39s]  Alright, you're fed.
[25255.39s -> 25260.77s]  Uh, you're okay.
[25260.77s -> 25262.77s]  I'm gonna feed you.
[25262.77s -> 25266.46s]  Leave a carrot.
[25266.46s -> 25268.46s]  You already owe us Minecraft VR.
[25268.46s -> 25279.15s]  Five fucking thousand community subs.
[25279.15s -> 25281.15s]  Five fucking thousand community subs.
[25283.15s -> 25285.15s]  Thank god it's April Fools.
[25285.15s -> 25290.46s]  What's the worst thing you've ever smelled?
[25290.46s -> 25292.46s]  One time there were eggs in the sink.
[25292.46s -> 25294.83s]  And they were wet.
[25294.83s -> 25299.06s]  And it ruined my whole afternoon.
[25299.06s -> 25301.36s]  The cooked eggs.
[25304.82s -> 25306.82s]  Yeah, wet eggs is the worst thing you could ever fucking smell in your life.
[25306.82s -> 25309.31s]  Alright, this is the one.
[25309.31s -> 25311.68s]  This is the one that actually really matters.
[25311.68s -> 25313.68s]  Because this is the go to rank C.
[25313.68s -> 25329.94s]  Only the winner will move on.
[25329.94s -> 25332.18s]  And we have rumor versus third.
[25334.18s -> 25340.32s]  Very balanced. High intelligence.
[25340.32s -> 25342.50s]  Decent speed.
[25342.50s -> 25345.76s]  But what about me?
[25345.76s -> 25349.54s]  216, 194.
[25349.54s -> 25355.74s]  Come on, I'm unstoppable here.
[25355.74s -> 25357.74s]  Never forget the five thousand subs.
[25364.27s -> 25366.58s]  It's April Fools.
[25366.58s -> 25368.58s]  I can say whatever the fuck I want.
[25368.58s -> 25372.48s]  Hey guys, my book will be done in like
[25372.48s -> 25374.48s]  two or three days.
[25374.48s -> 25381.90s]  It's like 1700 pages.
[25381.90s -> 25383.90s]  Whatever the fuck you want on April Fools.
[25383.90s -> 25386.72s]  All encompassing.
[25386.72s -> 25397.86s]  Any lie. You can say anything.
[25397.86s -> 25401.38s]  Tornado.
[25401.38s -> 25404.19s]  Not bad. Okay, let's go with a charge.
[25404.19s -> 25416.74s]  It's a good dodge.
[25416.74s -> 25421.78s]  Super claw.
[25421.78s -> 25423.78s]  I'm fine.
[25423.78s -> 25426.21s]  Let's head back. Let's get the guarantee here.
[25426.21s -> 25429.47s]  Zero to sixty. Sixty percent.
[25429.47s -> 25442.34s]  Get out of my life.
[25442.34s -> 25444.34s]  Colorado versus estate. I don't think we've even seen estate yet.
[25444.34s -> 25450.03s]  How do I feel about chat?
[25450.03s -> 25452.03s]  Well there's 3630 people here.
[25452.03s -> 25456.03s]  I think 3629 of them are amazing.
[25456.03s -> 25458.34s]  The one is one person. I don't know.
[25458.34s -> 25460.34s]  I'm not going to say who it is.
[25460.34s -> 25462.34s]  I hate them. There's one person here.
[25462.34s -> 25465.47s]  I'm not going to say who it is.
[25465.47s -> 25467.47s]  3602. I love
[25467.47s -> 25470.16s]  3601.
[25470.16s -> 25472.16s]  There's one person here. I don't like them.
[25472.16s -> 25475.81s]  That's the way it is.
[25475.81s -> 25477.81s]  Rumor versus estate. Estate lost the last match.
[25477.81s -> 25481.39s]  High intelligence.
[25481.39s -> 25483.39s]  Let's just burn you down with
[25483.39s -> 25493.18s]  power moves.
[25493.18s -> 25495.81s]  Joel, isn't it?
[25495.81s -> 25499.84s]  I don't want to say anything.
[25499.84s -> 25508.53s]  Thunder. Thank god.
[25508.53s -> 25510.53s]  It didn't hurt that much.
[25510.53s -> 25512.53s]  Zero to sixty. Sixty seven percent.
[25512.53s -> 25514.90s]  Get it.
[25514.90s -> 25516.90s]  That sucks to lose that. But I'm going to go for it again because
[25516.90s -> 25518.90s]  I max bet.
[25518.90s -> 25525.09s]  It was worth it. See?
[25525.09s -> 25528.29s]  I've got to chill the fuck out here.
[25528.29s -> 25532.45s]  I have no guts now.
[25532.45s -> 25537.38s]  Joel is... No, that's fine.
[25537.38s -> 25539.38s]  I told you I didn't want to say.
[25539.38s -> 25541.38s]  That doesn't mean who it is.
[25541.38s -> 25545.47s]  I'm not comfortable saying.
[25545.47s -> 25549.95s]  Holy shit.
[25549.95s -> 25551.95s]  That was a ton of damage. I've got to end this right now.
[25551.95s -> 25554.26s]  I've got to charge in right now.
[25554.26s -> 25556.26s]  Get it.
[25556.26s -> 25559.39s]  Come on. Yes. Thank god.
[25559.39s -> 25561.39s]  A huge bitch just came in.
[25561.39s -> 25565.74s]  Kristen, thanks for the fifty dollars.
[25565.74s -> 25567.74s]  Kristen with fifty bucks, five thousand bits.
[25567.74s -> 25570.05s]  They say, I hope one day you can stop
[25570.05s -> 25572.05s]  hating me.
[25572.05s -> 25578.06s]  Rewind to the riot.
[25578.06s -> 25583.70s]  Well, that implies that it's you.
[25583.70s -> 25585.70s]  Somebody else said it was ten fifty eight p.m. in Nevada.
[25585.70s -> 25587.70s]  April Fool's my butt time to pay up.
[25587.70s -> 25591.66s]  It doesn't matter.
[25591.66s -> 25593.66s]  I'm going off of... Hold on a second here.
[25593.66s -> 25595.66s]  I'm going off of
[25595.66s -> 25597.66s]  the general UTC time.
[25597.66s -> 25601.18s]  You know, the time zones like
[25601.18s -> 25603.18s]  UTC time
[25603.18s -> 25605.18s]  is just like regular time. GMT.
[25605.18s -> 25607.18s]  UTC.
[25607.18s -> 25610.19s]  What time is it UTC right now?
[25610.19s -> 25619.60s]  Six a.m.
[25619.60s -> 25621.60s]  It's six a.m. April Fool's on UTC.
[25621.60s -> 25623.60s]  That is like the general time
[25623.60s -> 25625.60s]  zone. That's the one
[25625.60s -> 25627.60s]  that everybody... UTC plus
[25627.60s -> 25629.60s]  six. UTC minus four.
[25629.60s -> 25632.80s]  I'm going by UTC.
[25632.80s -> 25635.87s]  I live in PDT.
[25635.87s -> 25639.14s]  But I make my
[25639.14s -> 25641.14s]  jokes in UTC.
[25641.14s -> 25650.74s]  I hope you're interested. High speed on
[25650.74s -> 25658.03s]  Kochi here. You live in a minus
[25658.03s -> 25660.03s]  two time zone. It's actually a minus three
[25660.03s -> 25663.17s]  time zone. You live in PST.
[25663.17s -> 25665.17s]  It's actually Pacific Daylight time now.
[25665.17s -> 25668.48s]  Read a book. I'm sorry.
[25668.48s -> 25670.48s]  Let's go.
[25670.48s -> 25672.48s]  Oh, it's another wheel.
[25672.48s -> 25676.58s]  This is like the bubblegum wheel.
[25676.58s -> 25688.21s]  Wow.
[25688.21s -> 25690.51s]  So cute. It really is.
[25690.51s -> 25692.75s]  Too bad it's going to die.
[25692.75s -> 25696.46s]  It's like a fish.
[25696.46s -> 25698.96s]  It's a bubblegum fish on a wheel.
[25698.96s -> 25700.96s]  Or like a grapefruit slice.
[25700.96s -> 25708.19s]  And if you have to rank C,
[25708.19s -> 25712.74s]  I can't wait. Who is it?
[25712.74s -> 25714.74s]  And do I even have any competition? Definitely not.
[25714.74s -> 25716.74s]  Oh, actually
[25716.74s -> 25718.74s]  Calabrino's not doing terrible.
[25718.74s -> 25721.30s]  Let's see what happens here. All right.
[25721.30s -> 25723.30s]  Calabrino is killing everybody.
[25723.30s -> 25727.33s]  Three and O.
[25727.33s -> 25734.94s]  I gotta be prepared for this.
[25734.94s -> 25736.94s]  The fish is insane to get. I have two CDs
[25736.94s -> 25738.94s]  out of like 200 that has
[25738.94s -> 25747.46s]  fish. Terrible intelligence.
[25747.46s -> 25749.46s]  Decent speed.
[25749.46s -> 25766.99s]  Really not that great.
[25766.99s -> 25770.51s]  Missed.
[25770.51s -> 25772.51s]  Sorry.
[25772.51s -> 25774.51s]  Blocked it, huh?
[25774.51s -> 25780.96s]  Can't block that.
[25780.96s -> 25782.96s]  I'm playing more of this?
[25782.96s -> 25784.96s]  I don't know. That could mean
[25784.96s -> 25787.20s]  there's a lot of meaning there.
[25787.20s -> 25789.20s]  As in, he's dead. He gave up.
[25791.20s -> 25793.20s]  So maybe you're talking about
[25793.20s -> 25795.20s]  you think this is Monster Rancher 2? This is actually
[25795.20s -> 25797.20s]  Monster Rancher 4.
[25797.20s -> 25799.20s]  If you'd like more of this, this is a
[25799.20s -> 25801.20s]  different game. Or more of this, maybe
[25801.20s -> 25803.20s]  you came here like seven hours ago.
[25803.20s -> 25805.20s]  We're still in this one. We're going to keep playing it.
[25805.20s -> 25807.20s]  I'm just making sure I cover all the bases there.
[25807.20s -> 25809.20s]  Answer all your questions.
[25809.20s -> 25814.64s]  All right. This is...
[25814.64s -> 25816.64s]  If Calabrino does this...
[25816.64s -> 25819.26s]  All right. This is bad.
[25819.26s -> 25821.26s]  I have to beat Calabrino or I don't...
[25821.26s -> 25824.78s]  Only one person wins.
[25824.78s -> 25831.31s]  None of these other scrubs matter.
[25831.31s -> 25833.49s]  All right. Here it is. This is for the championship.
[25833.49s -> 25835.49s]  For to rank up.
[25835.49s -> 25838.05s]  Why are you so good? That's why.
[25838.05s -> 25840.93s]  Okay. High intelligence.
[25840.93s -> 25843.94s]  Tons of life. Just watch out for the
[25843.94s -> 25845.94s]  intelligence moves. Defense is terrible though.
[25845.94s -> 25849.46s]  All right. Just watch out for the high
[25849.46s -> 25855.79s]  intelligence moves.
[25855.79s -> 25858.16s]  Wait! You two aren't planning on
[25858.16s -> 25860.16s]  entering the competition. You've got to be kidding me.
[25860.16s -> 25864.88s]  I think you're a little late.
[25864.88s -> 25866.88s]  But I'll beat you in a single punch. Wait, is this...
[25866.88s -> 25869.31s]  Because my Calabrino doesn't
[25869.31s -> 25871.31s]  have any more time to waste on you.
[25871.31s -> 25873.31s]  Oh, this is the...
[25873.31s -> 25875.92s]  This is the lady from the beginning. Right.
[25875.92s -> 25884.30s]  This is her Calabrino.
[25884.30s -> 25890.64s]  Well, I have to beat this.
[25890.64s -> 25893.20s]  Vroomer versus Calabrino.
[25893.20s -> 25895.20s]  Right off the bat.
[25895.20s -> 25897.82s]  What was that?
[25897.82s -> 25899.82s]  Mosquitoes out tonight?
[25899.82s -> 25904.05s]  What was that?
[25904.05s -> 25906.05s]  Mosquitoes out tonight?
[25906.05s -> 25923.25s]  Get the guarantee thing.
[25923.25s -> 25925.25s]  63%. 0-60. Kill it.
[25925.25s -> 25928.00s]  Yes!
[25928.00s -> 25930.37s]  That was a big crit too.
[25930.37s -> 25932.37s]  All right. We're gonna go with the charge.
[25932.37s -> 25936.02s]  And end it.
[25936.02s -> 25938.58s]  All right. Fine. I'm composed.
[25938.58s -> 25944.32s]  Okay. Slow down.
[25944.32s -> 25947.12s]  I only have 22.
[25947.12s -> 25949.12s]  That's not good. That's actually really bad.
[25949.12s -> 25951.12s]  No. What? Mosquitoes out
[25951.12s -> 25959.63s]  tonight?
[25959.63s -> 25961.63s]  17. Come on.
[25961.63s -> 25964.90s]  Goodbye.
[25964.90s -> 25966.90s]  You get to do final guts more than a
[25966.90s -> 25970.93s]  final time.
[25970.93s -> 25982.90s]  You're gonna make 15 of these?
[25982.90s -> 25984.90s]  Oh my god. Why?
[25984.90s -> 25987.07s]  Don't you dare.
[25987.07s -> 25990.08s]  Two fucking revives.
[25990.08s -> 25992.08s]  Oh, what we got? Fucking mosquitoes out tonight?
[25992.08s -> 25994.08s]  All right. Okay. That's not good. This is actually really fucking bad.
[25994.08s -> 26000.54s]  This is terrible.
[26000.54s -> 26013.86s]  I'm dead.
[26013.86s -> 26015.86s]  You got to revive twice.
[26015.86s -> 26018.48s]  What the fuck was that?
[26018.48s -> 26020.90s]  Why?
[26020.90s -> 26023.46s]  Nothing about that was fair.
[26023.46s -> 26025.46s]  He got to come back to life.
[26025.46s -> 26028.00s]  Final time.
[26028.00s -> 26032.99s]  Two final times.
[26032.99s -> 26034.99s]  That's fucking stupid.
[26034.99s -> 26049.01s]  All right. That's it. I'm going fed.
[26049.01s -> 26053.74s]  Now I have to do that all again.
[26053.74s -> 26056.69s]  That was not your fault.
[26056.69s -> 26064.22s]  That was bullshit.
[26064.22s -> 26068.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[26068.13s -> 26072.22s]  Roberto has a rank up, doesn't he?
[26072.22s -> 26079.18s]  Yeah, he does.
[26079.18s -> 26081.18s]  So annoyed by that.
[26081.18s -> 26090.02s]  The credits are gonna be long tonight, you know,
[26090.02s -> 26092.02s]  due to the 5,000 subs.
[26092.02s -> 26097.14s]  You know how fast that would go?
[26097.14s -> 26101.94s]  I'm gonna break my computer.
[26101.94s -> 26103.94s]  All right.
[26103.94s -> 26105.94s]  Let's at least get some good out of this.
[26105.94s -> 26110.99s]  And rank him up.
[26110.99s -> 26113.74s]  Everyone was such a joke.
[26113.74s -> 26115.74s]  And then you get the double final.
[26115.74s -> 26119.12s]  Wait.
[26119.12s -> 26121.12s]  What is this?
[26123.12s -> 26125.12s]  Doesn't even rank up?
[26125.12s -> 26127.12s]  What's going on?
[26131.12s -> 26134.26s]  Did I miss it?
[26134.26s -> 26136.26s]  No, this is yesterday.
[26136.26s -> 26138.62s]  What happened here?
[26138.62s -> 26142.02s]  Did I skip this?
[26142.02s -> 26144.02s]  Oh, fucking Jesus.
[26144.02s -> 26146.02s]  Look at this.
[26146.02s -> 26148.19s]  The next one's all the way in October.
[26153.23s -> 26170.90s]  Oh, no.
[26170.90s -> 26172.90s]  He did rank up. He did.
[26172.90s -> 26175.14s]  He did. He did. He did.
[26175.14s -> 26180.58s]  He did rank up. I remember.
[26180.58s -> 26182.58s]  He was so easy that he ranked up.
[26182.58s -> 26186.10s]  He's now in rank D.
[26186.10s -> 26188.10s]  Yeah, I'll save the game.
[26188.10s -> 26190.10s]  Guys, not tomorrow. The next day.
[26190.10s -> 26192.46s]  We're probably gonna play more of this.
[26192.46s -> 26194.46s]  I wanna beat this game.
[26194.46s -> 26199.97s]  So I will see you guys on
[26199.97s -> 26202.40s]  Tuesday.
[26202.40s -> 26204.40s]  We'll probably go Tuesday, Wednesday.
[26204.40s -> 26207.98s]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[26207.98s -> 26209.98s]  I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[26209.98s -> 26215.81s]  And let's do the bits.
[26215.81s -> 26217.81s]  And there was a ton of community subs tonight.
[26217.81s -> 26219.81s]  You'll see them all in a minute here.
[26219.81s -> 26225.89s]  The guild? Oh, don't worry. I won't forget.
[26225.89s -> 26228.96s]  I won't forget about the guild. Don't worry.
[26228.96s -> 26230.96s]  We will determine what we're gonna do with Wally
[26230.96s -> 26235.18s]  in the stream on Tuesday.
[26235.18s -> 26238.32s]  Hope you enjoyed it. That was fun.
[26238.32s -> 26240.94s]  I had a blast. It's definitely better than
[26240.94s -> 26243.89s]  three. And we'll see how much
[26243.89s -> 26245.89s]  better it is than two once we get some more monsters
[26245.89s -> 26249.02s]  in the mix. But let's go back to
[26249.02s -> 26251.02s]  about seven and a half hours ago. Let's read
[26251.02s -> 26256.34s]  some of these bits. Combine
[26256.34s -> 26258.34s]  Wally. Yeah, we'll see what happens.
[26258.34s -> 26263.38s]  We'll see what happens to Wally.
[26263.38s -> 26268.24s]  Will he be used? Okay.
[26268.24s -> 26270.24s]  So now let me get this
[26270.24s -> 26289.49s]  high. Okay, there we go.
[26289.49s -> 26294.16s]  Oh, well this whole thing screwed up.
[26294.16s -> 26297.04s]  Did it? Yeah, it did.
[26297.04s -> 26299.41s]  Well, it looks like
[26299.41s -> 26303.18s]  we're gonna have to start from here.
[26303.18s -> 26305.18s]  Because my stream labs
[26305.18s -> 26308.18s]  decided to stop
[26308.18s -> 26310.18s]  showing anything.
[26310.18s -> 26312.18s]  Up until about
[26312.18s -> 26314.18s]  four hours ago.
[26314.18s -> 26319.36s]  So that's odd. But I'll just use
[26319.36s -> 26322.62s]  the other site. It's just a German
[26322.62s -> 26338.50s]  mustard site.
[26338.50s -> 26345.92s]  Where is that site?
[26345.92s -> 26347.92s]  I had a book...
[26347.92s -> 26349.92s]  I thought I had it bookmarked.
[26349.92s -> 26352.80s]  So I'm gonna link me real quick.
[26352.80s -> 26355.62s]  Why is this not in my bookmarks?
[26355.62s -> 26366.75s]  Stream labs, why do you have to do this?
[26366.75s -> 26372.51s]  It's like, it's like,
[26372.51s -> 26374.51s]  Ipokedex or something. What is it called?
[26374.51s -> 26384.88s]  I know, I know one of you guys got one.
[26384.88s -> 26386.88s]  Not the Ipokedex.
[26386.88s -> 26397.23s]  Why must you do
[26397.23s -> 26408.24s]  this to me, stream labs?
[26408.24s -> 26412.08s]  Let me see if I can pull it from here.
[26412.08s -> 26414.08s]  Yeah, because right now it's only showing me from the last like
[26414.08s -> 26416.58s]  two hours now. It's all
[26416.58s -> 26418.58s]  fucked up. Why?
[26418.58s -> 26435.90s]  What the hell?
[26435.90s -> 26446.40s]  Let's see if I can find the site.
[26446.40s -> 26448.40s]  Does anybody have a link to this site? Does anybody remember
[26448.40s -> 26450.70s]  what this site was? Because it's not in my
[26450.70s -> 26462.03s]  bookmarks. No, it's not.
[26462.03s -> 26481.94s]  That's not it. Yeah, I'm checking
[26481.94s -> 26483.94s]  my history for it. I don't know why it's not here.
[26483.94s -> 26485.94s]  We used it like, not even like a
[26485.94s -> 26500.59s]  month ago.
[26500.59s -> 26502.59s]  That is the site?
[26502.59s -> 26510.66s]  Is it? The URL changed.
[26510.66s -> 26515.39s]  Oh. That's probably why.
[26515.39s -> 26526.27s]  Oh shit, yeah.
[26526.27s -> 26531.07s]  We weren't memeing you.
[26531.07s -> 26537.02s]  I was wondering, I was like, why the hell can I not
[26537.02s -> 26548.16s]  see it? It's a .org.
[26548.16s -> 26560.32s]  The layout looks great. Yeah,
[26560.32s -> 26562.32s]  whoever put this together, with somebody in the
[26562.32s -> 26564.32s]  community, did a hell of a job.
[26564.32s -> 26567.33s]  This is beautiful.
[26567.33s -> 26575.97s]  I should just fucking use this only.
[26575.97s -> 26578.85s]  Yeah, lazy look, right?
[26578.85s -> 26581.02s]  Alright, so let's go
[26581.02s -> 26593.62s]  earlier.
[26593.62s -> 26598.42s]  So we had mostly
[26598.42s -> 26601.23s]  lost. Thank you for the 250.
[26601.23s -> 26604.62s]  I'm going to say, hey Jimmy,
[26604.62s -> 26606.62s]  any thoughts of jumping on the GTA
[26606.62s -> 26608.62s]  RP gravy train? I've been
[26608.62s -> 26610.62s]  enjoying watching it a ton and you'd probably be great at it.
[26610.62s -> 26612.62s]  We actually talked about it
[26612.62s -> 26615.12s]  not too long ago.
[26615.12s -> 26617.49s]  A few streams ago I think about how
[26617.49s -> 26619.49s]  I love RP.
[26619.49s -> 26621.49s]  I love doing routines and bits.
[26621.49s -> 26623.49s]  But
[26623.49s -> 26625.49s]  I don't really do, I don't do well with
[26625.49s -> 26627.73s]  strangers.
[26627.73s -> 26629.73s]  And when there's like more than 3, 4, 5, 6 people on
[26629.73s -> 26631.73s]  the screen, everyone's doing their own routine.
[26631.73s -> 26633.73s]  It's
[26633.73s -> 26635.73s]  almost like you kind of wait in line to tell your joke.
[26635.73s -> 26638.03s]  And I'm more comfortable
[26638.03s -> 26640.03s]  doing it with people that I know, people that I know that I know I can
[26640.03s -> 26642.03s]  bounce off of really easily.
[26642.03s -> 26647.47s]  It's not that I can't do it
[26647.47s -> 26650.48s]  or don't want to do it, but
[26650.48s -> 26652.48s]  it's just something I would rather not do.
[26652.48s -> 26655.74s]  There's nothing against
[26655.74s -> 26657.74s]  GTA RP at all. I think it's fucking fantastic
[26657.74s -> 26659.74s]  that people are able to jump on
[26659.74s -> 26661.74s]  and make these characters and have this awesome time.
[26661.74s -> 26663.74s]  It's awesome.
[26663.74s -> 26670.34s]  Don't do it with strangers.
[26670.34s -> 26672.34s]  Yeah, but then you kind of, you gotta get like in a group
[26672.34s -> 26674.34s]  of at least a few people.
[26674.34s -> 26676.34s]  I know there's a few people that
[26676.34s -> 26678.34s]  I know that do it.
[26678.34s -> 26680.34s]  Kiwo does it.
[26680.34s -> 26682.34s]  I think Kiwo's probably the only person
[26682.34s -> 26684.77s]  that I know that does
[26684.77s -> 26686.77s]  GTA RP that I could
[26686.77s -> 26688.77s]  like talk to and be like, hey, yeah,
[26688.77s -> 26690.77s]  let me join you. But don't you
[26690.77s -> 26692.77s]  also have to get like white listed?
[26692.77s -> 26696.21s]  And isn't that
[26696.21s -> 26698.21s]  the process of I would have to be on a list
[26698.21s -> 26700.21s]  and there's priority
[26700.21s -> 26702.45s]  and stuff?
[26702.45s -> 26704.45s]  It's not just something I can just do.
[26704.45s -> 26706.45s]  It's not like, hey, I'm gonna do GTA RP
[26706.45s -> 26708.45s]  tomorrow. I'd have to get like on a
[26708.45s -> 26710.45s]  like a queue, right?
[26710.45s -> 26721.50s]  On some servers?
[26721.50s -> 26724.13s]  Yeah, I mean, maybe. I feel like it's
[26724.13s -> 26726.13s]  hit its apex.
[26726.13s -> 26729.01s]  Is it still something people want to see?
[26729.01s -> 26731.01s]  I mean, maybe I would look into it and see if it was
[26731.01s -> 26733.01s]  something that was possible with a few friends or something.
[26733.01s -> 26737.74s]  Just grease your way in
[26737.74s -> 26742.74s]  with streamer charm. If I
[26742.74s -> 26744.74s]  could go in there with a few friends
[26744.74s -> 26747.74s]  and make something happen
[26747.74s -> 26749.74s]  and play off of people
[26749.74s -> 26751.74s]  that I know, then
[26751.74s -> 26753.74s]  I'm not against it.
[26753.74s -> 26758.53s]  Maybe it's worth a try.
[26758.53s -> 26760.90s]  But we did talk about it a while ago.
[26760.90s -> 26762.90s]  Like last week or so. But thank you.
[26762.90s -> 26764.90s]  Hey, Lazy Luke!
[26764.90s -> 26766.90s]  Speak of the devil. I drew a
[26766.90s -> 26768.90s]  German version of my favorite album cover. No offense
[26768.90s -> 26771.78s]  to your beautiful hair.
[26771.78s -> 26774.98s]  Let's see this. Does this look
[26774.98s -> 26778.50s]  infected? Does this look bald?
[26778.50s -> 26781.44s]  What the hell? Is this
[26781.44s -> 26783.44s]  actually a Sum 41 cover?
[26783.44s -> 26791.44s]  Sum 41?
[26791.44s -> 26800.78s]  That's fucked up.
[26800.78s -> 26802.78s]  That's not safe for fucking work.
[26802.78s -> 26806.94s]  Don't click that if you're at work.
[26806.94s -> 26808.94s]  That looks 4 a.m. Hey, don't click that
[26808.94s -> 26810.94s]  if you're at work at 2 or 3 a.m.
[26810.94s -> 26819.50s]  But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[26819.50s -> 26825.97s]  The website's fucking beautiful, by the way.
[26825.97s -> 26827.97s]  Soharv, thanks for the $2.95.
[26827.97s -> 26831.36s]  Soharv.
[26831.36s -> 26833.36s]  German, will you be reprising your role as alien engineer
[26833.36s -> 26835.36s]  frog actor in the 3D sequel to Crypt Dark?
[26835.36s -> 26837.36s]  Also, did you know that the Rat
[26837.36s -> 26839.36s]  Movie 1 and 2 are rated higher than The Godfather
[26839.36s -> 26841.36s]  1 and 2 on IMDB?
[26841.36s -> 26843.36s]  What a travesty. That should never be a thing.
[26843.36s -> 26845.36s]  I did not know that, but
[26845.36s -> 26847.36s]  yes, I think they're using
[26847.36s -> 26849.36s]  lines
[26849.36s -> 26851.36s]  from Crypt Dark
[26851.36s -> 26853.36s]  in the 3D version. I think they're
[26853.36s -> 26855.36s]  just porting lots of lines over. I haven't been asked
[26855.36s -> 26857.36s]  to record anything new
[26857.36s -> 26859.36s]  yet. Maybe
[26859.36s -> 26861.36s]  I think they're just kind of going to be using the old lines?
[26861.36s -> 26863.36s]  Because it is like a
[26863.36s -> 26865.36s]  reimagining 3D version of it, right?
[26865.36s -> 26868.50s]  We'll see. We will see.
[26868.50s -> 26871.63s]  Thank you, J
[26871.63s -> 26873.63s]  Zanye West for the $10.
[26873.63s -> 26876.13s]  Work put me in charge of monthly charity
[26876.13s -> 26878.13s]  donations, so any leftovers are going
[26878.13s -> 26880.13s]  to the Germ Research Foundation.
[26880.13s -> 26883.01s]  I'll take them.
[26883.01s -> 26886.53s]  Thanks for the $10. Appreciate it,
[26886.53s -> 26888.53s]  J Zanye West
[26888.53s -> 26891.97s]  for the $10.
[26891.97s -> 26893.97s]  Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[26893.97s -> 26896.14s]  Remember how they got the
[26896.14s -> 26898.14s]  He Will Not Divide Us
[26898.14s -> 26900.14s]  flag one of those times by honking
[26900.14s -> 26902.14s]  a car horn near it and getting feedback
[26902.14s -> 26904.14s]  from chat? Someone's
[26904.14s -> 26906.14s]  eventually going to figure it out with
[26906.14s -> 26908.14s]  your vrooming car.
[26908.14s -> 26910.32s]  Where you are.
[26910.32s -> 26918.50s]  Uh, I think
[26918.50s -> 26920.50s]  you severely underestimate how many
[26920.50s -> 26923.76s]  busy fucking roads are
[26923.76s -> 26930.35s]  here. Derma lied about
[26930.35s -> 26932.35s]  5k subs, a new fucking user
[26932.35s -> 26936.58s]  name. God. That's just Vegas,
[26936.58s -> 26940.22s]  man. That's just the way it is.
[26940.22s -> 26948.03s]  You live near a NASCAR track.
[26948.03s -> 26950.64s]  I don't know. I have
[26950.64s -> 26954.16s]  no idea. But thank you,
[26954.16s -> 26956.16s]  Smelly Boy. Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers for the $4.
[26956.16s -> 26958.16s]  This is me
[26958.16s -> 26960.16s]  $104 I've given to you.
[26960.16s -> 26962.16s]  Took two years of being subbed and dropping
[26962.16s -> 26964.16s]  100 bits every so often to get there.
[26964.16s -> 26966.16s]  I'm not that one guy who gave
[26966.16s -> 26968.16s]  $600 in two hours,
[26968.16s -> 26970.16s]  but I at least got the boomer batch.
[26970.16s -> 26972.16s]  Take care of me, $604.
[26972.16s -> 26974.53s]  P.S.
[26974.53s -> 26976.53s]  Here's a new picture of Jupiter.
[26976.53s -> 26978.96s]  And it's a new NASA picture.
[26978.96s -> 26980.96s]  Look at that. Beautiful.
[26980.96s -> 26987.34s]  Look at that. Uh, thank you,
[26987.34s -> 26990.54s]  Superintendent Chalmers.
[26990.54s -> 26992.54s]  $600 in five seconds, $600 in
[26992.54s -> 26994.54s]  two years. It's still $600.
[26994.54s -> 26996.54s]  And it's... I'm
[26996.54s -> 26999.23s]  shocked that people
[26999.23s -> 27001.23s]  continue to pay money to me.
[27001.23s -> 27003.86s]  I just hope you still like the streams. I hope you're still
[27003.86s -> 27007.82s]  having a good time. Because
[27007.82s -> 27009.82s]  that's a lot of money to give anybody. It is.
[27009.82s -> 27016.66s]  Thank you.
[27016.66s -> 27018.66s]  And thank you so much to DubSkyDude
[27018.66s -> 27022.11s]  for the 250. Hey, Jerma, back in January
[27022.11s -> 27024.11s]  I gave bits and made a gotcha joke
[27024.11s -> 27026.11s]  saying my friend almost
[27026.11s -> 27028.11s]  died in a walk-in oven. Now
[27028.11s -> 27030.11s]  he's actually in the hospital. That's not good.
[27030.11s -> 27032.61s]  Uh, due to having
[27032.61s -> 27034.61s]  some blood clots. That's not, that's
[27034.61s -> 27038.64s]  not good at all.
[27038.64s -> 27040.64s]  Also, my dad had a heart attack on the same day.
[27040.64s -> 27042.64s]  Both are doing fine now, thankfully.
[27042.64s -> 27044.64s]  Just figured I'd share this bit of
[27044.64s -> 27046.64s]  dark irony. Stay healthy, everyone.
[27046.64s -> 27048.64s]  Well, that's... I'm glad they're doing
[27048.64s -> 27053.06s]  fine. But damn.
[27053.06s -> 27057.92s]  Thankfully they're
[27057.92s -> 27059.92s]  good. Thankfully they're good to go.
[27059.92s -> 27064.46s]  Stay healthy, everyone. That's true.
[27064.46s -> 27069.46s]  Thank you DubSky for the 250.
[27069.46s -> 27072.27s]  Glad everyone's okay.
[27072.27s -> 27075.73s]  ProcefProstar, thanks for the $5.
[27075.73s -> 27077.73s]  Play this visual novel,
[27077.73s -> 27079.73s]  but not Doki Doki Literature Club.
[27079.73s -> 27082.10s]  With a thumbs up guy.
[27082.10s -> 27085.23s]  Uh, this is not
[27085.23s -> 27087.23s]  a visual novel.
[27087.23s -> 27089.23s]  This is a monster breeding simulator.
[27089.23s -> 27098.38s]  Hey, AWildMaril, thanks
[27098.38s -> 27100.69s]  for the $25.
[27100.69s -> 27102.69s]  No message, just $25.
[27102.69s -> 27104.93s]  Thank you so much.
[27104.93s -> 27108.64s]  Cheer 10, cheer 10. 1, 2, 3,
[27108.64s -> 27111.39s]  4, 5. Thank you.
[27111.39s -> 27113.39s]  Thank you, Roguefort, for the
[27113.39s -> 27115.39s]  $11. I await his return.
[27115.39s -> 27117.76s]  And he does the beanbag
[27117.76s -> 27119.76s]  Sonic dab thing.
[27119.76s -> 27122.00s]  It's like an emote, but it's not an emote, it's like a
[27122.00s -> 27124.00s]  little... with the parentheses and stuff.
[27124.00s -> 27126.50s]  Virtual Monster Novel.
[27126.50s -> 27131.49s]  Yeah, there you go. There... I don't think
[27131.49s -> 27133.49s]  there is a beanbag Sonic in this game.
[27133.49s -> 27135.49s]  The beanbag monster, I don't think exists.
[27135.49s -> 27137.49s]  It might, maybe we'll unlock it.
[27137.49s -> 27141.06s]  We'll have to see.
[27141.06s -> 27143.06s]  Something or other, thanks for the 250.
[27143.06s -> 27145.36s]  If you fuse rumor with your dog,
[27145.36s -> 27147.36s]  would it be called the automobile?
[27147.36s -> 27151.82s]  Yeah, probably.
[27151.82s -> 27154.00s]  That's a good one.
[27154.00s -> 27158.22s]  Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the 250.
[27158.22s -> 27161.55s]  Just $2.50, thank you
[27161.55s -> 27166.16s]  so much.
[27166.16s -> 27168.16s]  Felix, thank you, Felix Felis, for the $5.
[27168.16s -> 27170.16s]  Hey, Jeremy, I know how much you
[27170.16s -> 27172.16s]  liked the last Germacorn,
[27172.16s -> 27174.16s]  so I had a few people on the Discord make some
[27174.16s -> 27176.16s]  more variants. I just know one of these has to be
[27176.16s -> 27178.16s]  a new emote. Germacorn for life.
[27178.16s -> 27182.32s]  My god.
[27182.32s -> 27190.70s]  Okay,
[27190.70s -> 27192.70s]  the second one is Germamustard.
[27192.70s -> 27197.44s]  The first one is wild.
[27197.44s -> 27199.44s]  I like that first one.
[27199.44s -> 27206.72s]  They're all great.
[27206.72s -> 27208.72s]  They're all perfectly nightmare inducing.
[27208.72s -> 27217.62s]  That's a good Jeremy
[27217.62s -> 27219.62s]  got scared emote, isn't it?
[27219.62s -> 27224.22s]  The last one
[27224.22s -> 27226.22s]  is really good. Yeah, but the
[27226.22s -> 27228.22s]  last one is just Jerva Disgust
[27228.22s -> 27230.22s]  put on corn this time.
[27230.22s -> 27239.04s]  Thank you for those.
[27239.04s -> 27241.04s]  I need to have... I got more slots. I gotta do
[27241.04s -> 27243.04s]  a lot of artwork stuff for this
[27243.04s -> 27245.04s]  channel. We need more stuff.
[27245.04s -> 27252.26s]  Those are all great, though.
[27252.26s -> 27254.26s]  Thank you Manboy for the $2.50.
[27254.26s -> 27256.50s]  I wanted to share this image
[27256.50s -> 27258.50s]  that Kroskinael...
[27258.50s -> 27261.31s]  Kroskinael
[27261.31s -> 27263.31s]  made after discussion in the
[27263.31s -> 27266.96s]  sub-Discord. The
[27266.96s -> 27275.79s]  Fire family.
[27275.79s -> 27280.40s]  This is awesome. Fire grandpa.
[27280.40s -> 27288.53s]  Look at Babyfire.
[27288.53s -> 27291.22s]  This is great.
[27291.22s -> 27294.10s]  Fire dog. Fire dog
[27294.10s -> 27296.10s]  had better have that hair
[27296.10s -> 27298.10s]  on his tail.
[27298.10s -> 27300.10s]  You know, that's a perfect place for it.
[27300.10s -> 27308.40s]  That's wonderful.
[27308.40s -> 27315.57s]  Thank you Kroskinael.
[27315.57s -> 27326.90s]  Those are wonderful. All of those
[27326.90s -> 27328.90s]  are just so charming and wonderful. Thank you.
[27328.90s -> 27332.35s]  Feroidian Weapon. Another $2.50.
[27332.35s -> 27335.68s]  No message, just
[27335.68s -> 27339.58s]  $2.50. Thank you.
[27339.58s -> 27341.76s]  Easy Pants. Thank you for the $10
[27341.76s -> 27344.32s]  Easy Pants. Hey Jeremy Boy.
[27344.32s -> 27346.32s]  I hope you had a great time streaming today.
[27346.32s -> 27348.32s]  Quick question. Any tips on
[27348.32s -> 27350.32s]  getting fit and exercising? I want to start
[27350.32s -> 27352.32s]  living a healthier lifestyle.
[27352.32s -> 27354.32s]  Any advice would be appreciated.
[27354.32s -> 27357.84s]  Easiest advice is drink more water.
[27357.84s -> 27360.66s]  Cut out some of the bullshit that
[27360.66s -> 27362.66s]  you're eating. I know I had to make the jokes
[27362.66s -> 27364.66s]  about the fucking cereal bullshit.
[27364.66s -> 27366.66s]  But in all honesty,
[27366.66s -> 27368.66s]  cut out
[27368.66s -> 27370.66s]  all like the sugary fucking
[27370.66s -> 27372.66s]  Gatorade drinks you drink and all the
[27372.66s -> 27375.22s]  sodas. You wouldn't
[27375.22s -> 27377.71s]  believe with just like
[27377.71s -> 27379.71s]  removing like two shitty drinks
[27379.71s -> 27381.71s]  a day if you're drinking them.
[27381.71s -> 27384.40s]  Get rid of energy drinks.
[27384.40s -> 27386.40s]  Don't drink those fucking things.
[27386.40s -> 27388.40s]  Drink coffee. Just drink like black coffee
[27388.40s -> 27391.73s]  instead. Or even like a little bit
[27391.73s -> 27396.27s]  of cream, that's fine. Drink more
[27396.27s -> 27398.77s]  water. Cut out some of the bullshit.
[27398.77s -> 27402.80s]  Eat more fish.
[27402.80s -> 27405.81s]  That's, I'm serious.
[27405.81s -> 27408.11s]  That's a meme on this channel, but it's for real.
[27408.11s -> 27414.19s]  Coffee's bad for your sleeping
[27414.19s -> 27416.19s]  schedule. Well if you don't,
[27416.19s -> 27418.19s]  don't drink coffee after like 7 or like
[27418.19s -> 27420.19s]  6 p.m. If you drink coffee at like
[27420.19s -> 27422.19s]  you know, 8, 9, 10, 11
[27422.19s -> 27424.19s]  o'clock in the morning, that's fine.
[27424.19s -> 27427.20s]  I've been drinking coffee for years.
[27427.20s -> 27429.57s]  And my sleep is terrible. So don't
[27429.57s -> 27434.62s]  listen to me. Go for a walk?
[27434.62s -> 27437.18s]  Yeah. And move around too.
[27437.18s -> 27439.18s]  Don't let your body just be like complacent
[27439.18s -> 27441.55s]  and just sit. Sitting
[27441.55s -> 27443.55s]  is actually so bad for you. It just is.
[27443.55s -> 27446.43s]  You put more compression
[27446.43s -> 27448.43s]  on your spine when you sit down than when you
[27448.43s -> 27452.72s]  do anything else. Just move around.
[27452.72s -> 27455.79s]  Take a little walk. 20 minutes a day.
[27455.79s -> 27458.61s]  Not even. 20 minutes
[27458.61s -> 27462.70s]  every couple days. Take a walk.
[27462.70s -> 27464.70s]  7 and a half hours of sitting. Yeah.
[27464.70s -> 27466.70s]  And you know what I'm going to do tomorrow?
[27466.70s -> 27468.70s]  I'm going to take a walk.
[27468.70s -> 27471.71s]  I'm going to get up and I'm going to fucking do
[27471.71s -> 27473.71s]  two push-ups because that's all I can do.
[27473.71s -> 27476.34s]  But for real.
[27476.34s -> 27479.41s]  I do two miles a day and honestly I've never
[27479.41s -> 27483.76s]  felt better. There you go.
[27483.76s -> 27485.76s]  Just stay active. And staying active doesn't necessarily
[27485.76s -> 27487.76s]  even need to, you don't have to like go to the gym and lift
[27487.76s -> 27489.76s]  250 pounds in a bench press.
[27489.76s -> 27491.94s]  You don't got to go to the gym
[27491.94s -> 27494.56s]  five times a week.
[27494.56s -> 27496.56s]  Stuff as simple as just being
[27496.56s -> 27499.18s]  active is so good for
[27499.18s -> 27507.18s]  your health. Consistently
[27507.18s -> 27509.42s]  active helps.
[27509.42s -> 27518.58s]  But thank you EasyPants. Hopefully some of that
[27518.58s -> 27522.67s]  helps you. Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[27522.67s -> 27525.42s]  Garfield the Bunday Killer.
[27525.42s -> 27527.42s]  Hello Garfield. Thank you for the five dollars.
[27527.42s -> 27529.92s]  Five dollars.
[27529.92s -> 27532.35s]  Back to back here.
[27532.35s -> 27534.35s]  Another Monster Rancher sure does bring back memories
[27534.35s -> 27536.35s]  doesn't it Jerma? Remember when I began donating
[27536.35s -> 27538.35s]  all my Garphographs the day that Beam Bag
[27538.35s -> 27541.23s]  Sonic was born?
[27541.23s -> 27543.23s]  That is where you came from isn't it? It feels like
[27543.23s -> 27545.23s]  the only yesterday Garfield
[27545.23s -> 27547.41s]  started donating. Monster Rancher
[27547.41s -> 27549.41s]  4 is actually how I got familiar with this
[27549.41s -> 27551.41s]  series Jerma. I had a floating
[27551.41s -> 27553.41s]  rabbit with a mallet
[27553.41s -> 27555.41s]  as one of my monsters. It warms
[27555.41s -> 27557.41s]  it warms a cat's heart seeing
[27557.41s -> 27559.41s]  a Jerma and his pets. I'm getting all teary eyed
[27559.41s -> 27561.41s]  Jerma. All this emotion and I don't
[27561.41s -> 27563.41s]  even have a Jerma anniversary gift.
[27563.41s -> 27566.22s]  It's alright.
[27566.22s -> 27571.41s]  April Fool's Special.
[27571.41s -> 27573.90s]  Yeah it's called I'm going out with my
[27573.90s -> 27576.78s]  girlfriend. For
[27576.78s -> 27582.99s]  real. Not joke.
[27582.99s -> 27584.99s]  Garfield the Monday Killer again. Here's the rest of you five dollars.
[27584.99s -> 27586.99s]  Here I found the Garf-versary
[27586.99s -> 27588.99s]  present. That's right. Hope you like it.
[27588.99s -> 27590.99s]  Maybe even show it on stream. You don't have to
[27590.99s -> 27592.99s]  show it on stream. Okay.
[27592.99s -> 27595.23s]  Took me about a month to do.
[27595.23s -> 27597.98s]  Hope you like it. Hang it on
[27597.98s -> 27599.98s]  your wall. You must hang it on your wall.
[27599.98s -> 27601.98s]  I'm just Garfing with you mate.
[27601.98s -> 27603.98s]  Also want to thank Chat for being there and my
[27603.98s -> 27605.98s]  mother back
[27605.98s -> 27607.98s]  at the Italian restaurant.
[27607.98s -> 27610.42s]  Happy Garf-versary Jerma. Let's see here.
[27610.42s -> 27617.78s]  There's a lot of Garfields.
[27617.78s -> 27620.72s]  Why does Garfield have a Miss Piggy
[27620.72s -> 27622.72s]  Puppet? I don't understand that.
[27622.72s -> 27632.05s]  There's a penis?
[27632.05s -> 27634.05s]  Oh no there's not.
[27634.05s -> 27636.29s]  Fucking god damn it. Don't even say that.
[27636.29s -> 27640.58s]  Where?
[27640.58s -> 27651.12s]  You see how easy this is?
[27651.12s -> 27653.12s]  I can't fucking link shit anymore.
[27653.12s -> 27655.30s]  I know. Okay.
[27655.30s -> 27657.30s]  There is it. There is it. But like hey link
[27657.30s -> 27659.30s]  link. Hey hey there it is.
[27659.30s -> 27661.30s]  Oh link this place. Yeah sure.
[27661.30s -> 27665.78s]  I gotta fucking have a screening process.
[27665.78s -> 27673.14s]  But thank you Garfield.
[27673.14s -> 27675.55s]  That's wonderful. You can try.
[27675.55s -> 27677.55s]  I can trust Garfield. I can.
[27677.55s -> 27680.50s]  KXZ 501 10 bucks.
[27680.50s -> 27683.57s]  They say victory bits. Thank you.
[27683.57s -> 27686.45s]  Thank you KXZ. For the 10
[27686.45s -> 27689.71s]  dollars. Much love to you.
[27689.71s -> 27692.78s]  Garfield we trust the Flintstones.
[27692.78s -> 27694.96s]  We don't.
[27694.96s -> 27696.96s]  That was awful.
[27696.96s -> 27698.96s]  Oh I have nightmares about
[27698.96s -> 27703.82s]  that scenario.
[27703.82s -> 27713.87s]  That was so fucked up.
[27713.87s -> 27715.87s]  We don't even talk. We don't have to talk about it.
[27715.87s -> 27719.07s]  We're going to bury that. Tingy thanks for the 250.
[27719.07s -> 27721.07s]  Oh no I dropped some money.
[27721.07s -> 27723.07s]  Sherp. Oh fuck oh no. The vacuum
[27723.07s -> 27725.07s]  sucked up my bits. Sometimes.
[27725.07s -> 27730.45s]  Hey Silverflame. Thanks for the
[27730.45s -> 27732.45s]  two dollars and fifty cents. Hey Jerma Sally. I'm not
[27732.45s -> 27734.45s]  part of the mafia and can't donate
[27734.45s -> 27736.45s]  hundreds of dollars. But here's some money.
[27736.45s -> 27738.45s]  Thank you regardless.
[27738.45s -> 27740.45s]  Anywho. Today is my birthday. Getting drunk
[27740.45s -> 27742.45s]  and watching your streams is a great way to spend it.
[27742.45s -> 27744.45s]  You're my favorite entertainer in the world bro.
[27744.45s -> 27746.45s]  Keep doing what you're doing because both me and hundreds
[27746.45s -> 27748.45s]  of others love it. And you
[27748.45s -> 27752.35s]  smooches. Bye.
[27752.35s -> 27754.35s]  I hope you enjoyed yourself. Hope you enjoyed your night.
[27754.35s -> 27757.42s]  Happy birthday. Hope you didn't drink
[27757.42s -> 27761.20s]  too much. It's always
[27761.20s -> 27764.21s]  nice to kick back a few and hang
[27764.21s -> 27766.21s]  out and watch some streams. Or
[27766.21s -> 27768.21s]  stream. You know I drink on stream sometimes.
[27768.21s -> 27770.21s]  You've seen it.
[27770.21s -> 27778.40s]  There's dozens of us out here.
[27778.40s -> 27781.60s]  You got drunk on cooking wine.
[27781.60s -> 27783.60s]  Yeah. Cause I wanted to drink it.
[27783.60s -> 27789.42s]  Thank you masked hero
[27789.42s -> 27791.42s]  man for the three dollars. The other day
[27791.42s -> 27793.42s]  I sent you this video. I forgot to mention how long it
[27793.42s -> 27795.73s]  was. But I have the part
[27795.73s -> 27797.73s]  I actually wanted you to see here. Hopefully
[27797.73s -> 27799.73s]  you like it. It's a lot shorter since 21
[27799.73s -> 27801.73s]  minutes of 2D movie maker.
[27801.73s -> 27803.90s]  It's hard to stomach.
[27803.90s -> 27821.79s]  Let's see.
[27821.79s -> 27823.79s]  No this is not going to play is it?
[27823.79s -> 27825.79s]  Because I have this connected to my
[27825.79s -> 27830.08s]  Can you guys hear this? I can't.
[27830.08s -> 27832.08s]  I'm through
[27832.08s -> 27835.41s]  my Playstation 2 right now.
[27835.41s -> 27843.09s]  Let's see if I can hear this.
[27843.09s -> 27849.49s]  Can I hear this? What was it
[27849.49s -> 27851.49s]  Oh.
[27851.49s -> 27853.49s]  A slice of deep space. Moon fighting.
[27853.49s -> 27861.23s]  We all
[27861.23s -> 27863.23s]  want to see me turn into a
[27863.23s -> 27865.23s]  super saiyan.
[27865.23s -> 27867.23s]  Turn into a what?
[27871.23s -> 27876.74s]  Now it looks like
[27876.74s -> 27878.74s]  I'm a super saiyan again.
[27878.74s -> 27880.74s]  There's no visual.
[27880.74s -> 27882.74s]  Yeah well you guys have to figure out what's going on.
[27882.74s -> 27884.74s]  I have to bring out this power.
[27884.74s -> 27886.74s]  But you killed
[27886.74s -> 27888.74s]  Fleurgey. And I can't
[27888.74s -> 27890.74s]  be dealing with that.
[27890.74s -> 27892.74s]  Oh shut up.
[27897.04s -> 27899.92s]  I think that's pretty well done.
[27899.92s -> 27901.92s]  He's too strong.
[27901.92s -> 27903.92s]  But I have to beat him for Fleurgey.
[27905.92s -> 27907.92s]  Who's Fleurgey?
[27911.76s -> 27913.76s]  Time for you to taste my
[27913.76s -> 27915.76s]  final punch.
[27915.76s -> 27917.76s]  Big
[27917.76s -> 27919.76s]  Bastard
[27919.76s -> 27921.76s]  Oh hey that's kind of scary.
[27921.76s -> 27923.76s]  One punch.
[27939.25s -> 27941.25s]  Hey that was fucking crazy.
[27941.25s -> 27945.02s]  That was a fight on the moon.
[27945.02s -> 27947.84s]  Somebody said they were too high for this.
[27947.84s -> 27956.61s]  Relax don't worry.
[27956.61s -> 27958.61s]  The music's from One Punch Man. Yeah it is.
[27958.61s -> 27964.05s]  Well this makes much more sense.
[27969.55s -> 27971.79s]  Thank you Masterman
[27971.79s -> 27975.70s]  for your 3D
[27975.70s -> 27977.70s]  movie maker animation.
[27977.70s -> 27979.94s]  Sorry for making you watch that.
[27979.94s -> 27984.42s]  Why what? No it's fine.
[27984.42s -> 27986.42s]  Some of those animations are really
[27986.42s -> 27988.42s]  some of that shit takes a long fucking time in this program.
[27988.42s -> 27992.77s]  Which you guys don't understand.
[27992.77s -> 27994.77s]  Some of those like explosions and
[27994.77s -> 27996.77s]  hand beams.
[27996.77s -> 27998.77s]  That's a lot of processing power for
[27998.77s -> 28002.42s]  Windows 95 to handle.
[28002.42s -> 28006.96s]  But thank you Masterman.
[28006.96s -> 28008.96s]  And just the frame by frame that you have to do to make that
[28008.96s -> 28010.96s]  with like balls and sticks.
[28010.96s -> 28017.17s]  It's hard to do. Hey Jess you got it
[28017.17s -> 28019.17s]  thanks for the 250. Here's to fund your lucky charms.
[28019.17s -> 28021.17s]  I'd eat that too if I wasn't too lazy to put in the time
[28021.17s -> 28023.17s]  it takes to pick out all the marshmallows.
[28023.17s -> 28028.85s]  I got you.
[28028.85s -> 28030.85s]  Somebody in chat actually was like really upset.
[28030.85s -> 28033.60s]  And I kind of felt bad. They were just like why would you do
[28033.60s -> 28036.16s]  that? Like what the fuck is wrong
[28036.16s -> 28038.16s]  with you? What a waste of food.
[28038.16s -> 28040.16s]  Are you really that fucked up?
[28040.16s -> 28047.39s]  It was me.
[28047.39s -> 28054.43s]  Why would you do that?
[28054.43s -> 28059.42s]  I agree with that guy. Yeah I know.
[28059.42s -> 28063.46s]  But thank you Jess you got it.
[28063.46s -> 28065.46s]  VR Josh thanks for the 250. Jerma here's
[28065.46s -> 28067.46s]  some money to go toward your insulin
[28067.46s -> 28069.46s]  fund once you get diagnosed with diabetes after
[28069.46s -> 28071.46s]  eating balls of sugar for breakfast lunch
[28071.46s -> 28073.46s]  and dinner. Only breakfast and dinner.
[28073.46s -> 28075.46s]  But it makes me brush my teeth. I'm going to have real clean teeth.
[28075.46s -> 28078.34s]  Thank you for the 250.
[28078.34s -> 28084.10s]  Asbestos
[28084.10s -> 28086.10s]  Flask thanks for the four dollars
[28086.10s -> 28088.10s]  and two cents. Hope you have a six man
[28088.10s -> 28090.10s]  condiment battle
[28090.10s -> 28092.10s]  next rumble.
[28092.10s -> 28098.61s]  Why?
[28098.61s -> 28100.61s]  Because we talked about drinking condiments for
[28100.61s -> 28103.55s]  30 seconds. Hey
[28103.55s -> 28105.55s]  Sad Vega thanks for the 250. It was 10 58
[28105.55s -> 28107.55s]  p.m. Nevada time. We already talked
[28107.55s -> 28109.55s]  about it. We're going on UTC plus 8.
[28109.55s -> 28112.18s]  Thank you for the 250 though Sad Vega.
[28112.18s -> 28114.18s]  Pika Banana thanks for the 250.
[28114.18s -> 28116.18s]  Fun stream as always. Thanks for watching.
[28116.18s -> 28120.46s]  I'm going to get the credits rolling here.
[28120.46s -> 28123.73s]  They're probably going to go pretty fast.
[28123.73s -> 28125.90s]  Because there was a shitload of community subs
[28125.90s -> 28128.14s]  tonight. There were
[28128.14s -> 28130.14s]  I think like four or five
[28130.14s -> 28132.14s]  hundred almost community subs.
[28132.14s -> 28134.14s]  Which is insane.
[28134.14s -> 28137.98s]  Look at that.
[28137.98s -> 28142.14s]  Can't even see them go by.
[28142.14s -> 28144.14s]  That's high speed subs.
[28144.14s -> 28152.21s]  Thank you everybody that subbed and resubbed
[28152.21s -> 28154.21s]  all the community subs you guys.
[28154.21s -> 28156.58s]  You guys are too much. Thank you.
[28156.58s -> 28159.39s]  And while we see this extreme
[28159.39s -> 28161.39s]  amount of people that have subscribed to the channel tonight.
[28161.39s -> 28163.76s]  Remember when you used to read these?
[28163.76s -> 28167.28s]  Yeah I do.
[28167.28s -> 28176.35s]  Oh my god.
[28176.35s -> 28178.72s]  That's insane. Try and read them now?
[28178.72s -> 28180.72s]  Okay. Back on the agreement? No.
[28180.72s -> 28183.86s]  Impossible. Not possible.
[28183.86s -> 28191.98s]  Hey Zshpey thanks right
[28191.98s -> 28194.67s]  at the end. Thank you for the 10 dollars Zshpey.
[28194.67s -> 28196.67s]  Hello Jeremy. Just reminding
[28196.67s -> 28198.67s]  just a reminder to try
[28198.67s -> 28202.90s]  in and out since you're on the west coast.
[28202.90s -> 28204.90s]  I've had in and out a few times.
[28204.90s -> 28206.90s]  Also I'm craving some skate
[28206.90s -> 28208.90s]  from you in the future hopefully.
[28208.90s -> 28214.70s]  It's probably not going to happen. For your
[28214.70s -> 28216.70s]  fitness comments one way to get in good shape is to find a
[28216.70s -> 28218.70s]  really fun active hobby like rock climbing.
[28218.70s -> 28221.71s]  That's true. That is true.
[28221.71s -> 28230.42s]  Getting a hobby that makes you move around
[28230.42s -> 28232.91s]  is good for you if you can get
[28232.91s -> 28235.47s]  into something. Absolutely.
[28235.47s -> 28243.07s]  But yeah I've had in and out.
[28243.07s -> 28249.09s]  It is good. It is a good
[28249.09s -> 28251.09s]  little joint to get a quick berg.
[28251.09s -> 28253.39s]  I will say.
[28253.39s -> 28255.39s]  The subs are still going that fast.
[28255.39s -> 28257.39s]  How many subs is it total?
[28257.39s -> 28261.49s]  752 subs
[28261.49s -> 28266.54s]  this stream. Total.
[28266.54s -> 28269.68s]  Let me see what I have. Okay.
[28269.68s -> 28278.06s]  Oh my god. Yeah because
[28278.06s -> 28280.06s]  I was at 40
[28280.06s -> 28282.06s]  I was at like 4900 subs.
[28282.06s -> 28285.20s]  Like a 2 days ago or something.
[28285.20s -> 28287.20s]  Or 5100 or 4900 or something.
[28287.20s -> 28293.47s]  Holy shit. Yeah.
[28293.47s -> 28296.67s]  I'm
[28296.67s -> 28298.67s]  1 trillion emotes unlocked.
[28298.67s -> 28303.34s]  49? No.
[28303.34s -> 28308.14s]  4900.
[28308.14s -> 28318.64s]  Not 49000.
[28318.64s -> 28325.10s]  That's fucking crazy.
[28325.10s -> 28327.10s]  If you guys remember from
[28327.10s -> 28329.10s]  like 3 or 4 months ago
[28329.10s -> 28331.10s]  I think we crossed 7000 subs
[28331.10s -> 28334.56s]  from a bunch of gifted subs
[28334.56s -> 28336.56s]  and a bunch of like sub trains.
[28336.56s -> 28341.68s]  And I was at 4900
[28341.68s -> 28348.06s]  last week.
[28348.06s -> 28350.06s]  Yeah there was a point where
[28350.06s -> 28352.06s]  it came down but
[28352.06s -> 28354.06s]  I was up at fucking 7
[28354.06s -> 28356.06s]  damn thousand subs.
[28356.06s -> 28358.06s]  At least for a little while. It was there for a while.
[28358.06s -> 28371.57s]  Absolutely fucking insane.
[28371.57s -> 28375.02s]  Thank you everybody.
[28375.02s -> 28377.97s]  Still a couple more bits to do.
[28377.97s -> 28379.97s]  But that was
[28379.97s -> 28382.46s]  for the 10 bucks.
[28382.46s -> 28386.24s]  Talking about internet.
[28386.24s -> 28388.24s]  Hey Jermbo I've been super sick
[28388.24s -> 28390.24s]  for a while now on your VODs plus this stream
[28390.24s -> 28392.24s]  has been keeping me alive.
[28392.24s -> 28394.24s]  Anyway here's a quick interesting question for you.
[28394.24s -> 28396.67s]  What's the scariest oh shit this is
[28396.67s -> 28398.67s]  going to get my channel banned moment you've had on
[28398.67s -> 28400.67s]  the stream. Keep up the good work.
[28400.67s -> 28404.90s]  The Flintstones thing.
[28404.90s -> 28412.38s]  Definitely. Cause that was like actual
[28412.38s -> 28414.38s]  like weird fucked up
[28414.38s -> 28416.38s]  porn that like I linked to.
[28416.38s -> 28420.67s]  So it wasn't on the stream but
[28420.67s -> 28422.67s]  I like linked to a page
[28422.67s -> 28432.66s]  that had it on there. So
[28432.66s -> 28436.94s]  it definitely was that. When did this happen?
[28436.94s -> 28438.94s]  I don't know like a year or two ago?
[28438.94s -> 28440.94s]  When was that? That was like a year ago.
[28440.94s -> 28442.94s]  It was from some yeah it was from like a wiki page.
[28442.94s -> 28444.94s]  Like a McDonald's wiki character
[28444.94s -> 28455.95s]  page. When was this?
[28455.95s -> 28457.95s]  It was during Red Dead 1. That was a long time ago.
[28457.95s -> 28462.50s]  It was like more than a year ago.
[28462.50s -> 28464.50s]  But thank you Sergio. But we
[28464.50s -> 28466.50s]  were just talking about it.
[28466.50s -> 28469.82s]  Jermbo lied about 5k subs
[28469.82s -> 28471.82s]  thanks to the 250. I would have a sub if you didn't
[28471.82s -> 28473.82s]  lie. It was April Fools if I was just kidding.
[28473.82s -> 28475.82s]  It was just an extreme
[28475.82s -> 28477.82s]  crazy thing that I said that didn't mean anything.
[28477.82s -> 28490.35s]  Cause it was April Fools.
[28490.35s -> 28494.00s]  Why is it? Why does that LUL
[28494.00s -> 28498.48s]  look different?
[28498.48s -> 28500.48s]  This LUL there's two LULs
[28500.48s -> 28506.18s]  one looks like weird.
[28506.18s -> 28508.35s]  Oh that's okay.
[28508.35s -> 28510.35s]  That's the B. That's the BTTV one.
[28510.35s -> 28512.35s]  I was like did they change that right now
[28512.35s -> 28514.35s]  or something? That's the old one right? Okay.
[28514.35s -> 28524.45s]  I see.
[28524.45s -> 28526.45s]  I have better TwitchTV now so I can see it.
[28526.45s -> 28528.45s]  And hey Sweenex
[28528.45s -> 28530.45s]  thank you Sweenex for the 10 bucks. Hey Jerm
[28530.45s -> 28532.45s]  made an actual. I made an actual Jex
[28532.45s -> 28534.45s]  mix cereal box if you want to check it out. Feel free
[28534.45s -> 28536.69s]  to show it.
[28536.69s -> 28539.18s]  New
[28539.18s -> 28541.18s]  bald coin marshmallows.
[28541.18s -> 28550.70s]  That's funny.
[28550.70s -> 28552.70s]  There's a dick on there. I see a dick.
[28552.70s -> 28561.90s]  Right? But no thank you.
[28561.90s -> 28570.74s]  This is fucking awesome. Thank you so much
[28570.74s -> 28576.88s]  Sweenex. I did not put
[28576.88s -> 28578.88s]  I'm just referencing
[28578.88s -> 28580.88s]  what somebody else said earlier.
[28580.88s -> 28583.06s]  But that's going to be it guys.
[28583.06s -> 28585.06s]  I'll see you guys in
[28585.06s -> 28587.06s]  two days. I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[28587.06s -> 28589.06s]  We will continue Monster Rancher 4.
[28589.06s -> 28591.36s]  And depending on how much we go there
[28591.36s -> 28593.36s]  we might just keep going. I don't know.
[28593.36s -> 28595.36s]  I'm into it though. I think it's fun. I think it's
[28595.36s -> 28597.36s]  interesting and I want to at least get to a point where we can
[28597.36s -> 28600.11s]  do some people together.
[28600.11s -> 28602.11s]  Special thanks to Joel.
[28602.11s -> 28604.11s]  Everybody that came over from
[28604.11s -> 28606.11s]  Joel's channel. Thanks for the raid.
[28606.11s -> 28608.99s]  See you guys real soon.
[28608.99s -> 28613.41s]  Be careful tonight
[28613.41s -> 28615.41s]  and tomorrow because people are going to be saying all kinds
[28615.41s -> 28617.65s]  of weird fucked up shit.
[28617.65s -> 28619.65s]  Like I wanted to give you guys an example before
[28619.65s -> 28621.65s]  to prepare you for it. I'm going to give
[28621.65s -> 28623.65s]  5,000 community subs.
[28623.65s -> 28625.65s]  You got to be prepared for that. I got you
[28625.65s -> 28633.78s]  with that one so you're ready for it.
[28633.78s -> 28635.78s]  But have a great night.
[28635.78s -> 28638.08s]  See you guys real soon. Take care of yourselves.
[28638.08s -> 28642.86s]  Have a good one.
[28680.01s -> 28682.01s]  Favorite species of sea creature?
[28682.01s -> 28684.01s]  Sea horse.
[28684.01s -> 28689.58s]  Do I have any pre-stream or post-stream rituals?
[28689.58s -> 28691.58s]  Pre-stream, coffee, pulse stream, bath.
[28691.58s -> 28696.95s]  Favorite album?
[28696.95s -> 28698.95s]  Demon Days by The Grylls.
[28698.95s -> 28705.42s]  Can you make some cat noises? Yeah, sure.
[28705.42s -> 28715.72s]  Least favorite food?
[28715.72s -> 28717.72s]  Uh...
[28717.72s -> 28719.72s]  I don't like soy sauce.
[28719.72s -> 28729.58s]  That thing's with soy sauce on it.
[28729.58s -> 28731.58s]  Is General Grieve going to be a German rumble? No.
[28731.58s -> 28737.08s]  What's the worst fruit?
[28737.08s -> 28739.26s]  Uh...
[28739.26s -> 28741.26s]  Like papaya or something. I don't eat it.
[28741.26s -> 28751.69s]  Fattest animal you can think of?
[28751.69s -> 28753.69s]  An elephant.
[28753.69s -> 28761.37s]  That's 8 hours. See you guys later.
[28761.37s -> 28763.37s]  Do you listen to Vinny's CDs?
[28763.37s -> 28765.37s]  Funny thing about Vinny's CDs,
[28765.37s -> 28769.34s]  it's going in.
[28769.34s -> 28771.34s]  We're going to get a monster out of Redbox.
[28771.34s -> 28773.70s]  It's literally sitting right here next to me.
[28773.70s -> 28781.45s]  So, yeah, that's
[28781.45s -> 28784.84s]  right here. That's it.
[28784.84s -> 28787.46s]  I will see you
[28787.46s -> 28789.46s]  on Tuesday.
[28789.46s -> 28792.71s]  Have a great one, guys.
[28792.71s -> 28794.71s]  Happy April Fool's.
[28794.71s -> 28815.37s]  See you soon.
