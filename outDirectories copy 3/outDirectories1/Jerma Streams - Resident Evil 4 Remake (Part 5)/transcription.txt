[33.46s -> 50.73s]  Hello. How you doing? Doing pretty good. On time. It's funny that I can be four or five
[50.73s -> 55.80s]  minutes late and still be considered on time. I appreciate that. Thanks for giving me the uh,
[56.52s -> 74.86s]  the extra leeway. Oh it's 6.05! He's on time! Not really. But better. Better. Okay. So hello.
[75.42s -> 86.14s]  I'm gonna play some mercenaries today. Came out today. I remember playing this on the old Resident
[86.14s -> 97.98s]  Evil 4. I got very addicted to this. A very long time ago. Dude the Roblox stream was funny as fuck.
[98.54s -> 109.13s]  I mean, I just had a good time. I appreciate that you think that though. It was a lot of fun.
[113.10s -> 126.30s]  And that's all that matters at the end of the day. Do I know who Hunk is? I do. Don't spoil it.
[127.02s -> 155.69s]  Oh I forgot to tweet. There we go. You're gonna have to be a full-time Roblox streamer. I feel
[155.69s -> 163.08s]  like Roblox is kind of a... I feel like that's a really easy way to be able to hit up other
[163.08s -> 169.22s]  streamers and just go, hey do you want to just do this for a few hours? Because one of the things
[169.22s -> 176.26s]  that's actually kind of difficult streaming is that there's so many people to reach out to or
[176.26s -> 178.82s]  talk to or whatever and it's like, oh what about you? Do you want to do something? Maybe I'll do
[178.82s -> 184.76s]  something with you. And it's like, oh what do you want to do? And it's like, oh fuck. What do we want
[184.76s -> 190.68s]  to do? I think that's a very simple thing just to be like, let's go ride roller coasters and Roblox
[190.68s -> 202.04s]  for an hour. I think that's just easy. It's just easy to like put that line out, right? Good title?
[207.86s -> 220.55s]  Well I didn't make it so don't give me the credit. It's simple and fun. I mean it's,
[220.55s -> 227.02s]  it is whatever you decide to make it I guess. There's a lot of stuff on Roblox from what I've
[227.02s -> 234.12s]  been told and I don't know a lot of it is probably not very good. There's probably a ton of really
[234.12s -> 239.30s]  just, there's a lot of really really good things. There's probably a lot of really bad things too.
[239.30s -> 247.98s]  I don't know anything about it. Why are you a hater? I don't know. I'm just saying. I don't
[247.98s -> 253.38s]  know. There could be a lot of things that aren't very good. Is that why people have opinions on it?
[253.38s -> 260.44s]  I don't know. I don't know anything about it. Nice centrist take. That's how you walk it back
[260.44s -> 273.93s]  real quick. No I genuinely don't know. My only experience with Roblox was two and a half hours
[274.01s -> 282.73s]  two days ago. I don't know anything about the platform at all but I had a lot of fun. I thought
[282.73s -> 287.50s]  it was, I thought it was a really enjoyable experience so I'm probably gonna do more.
[290.10s -> 295.67s]  Play with Ludwig. I gotta hit Ludwig up. We wanted to do something like weeks ago.
[296.39s -> 304.57s]  Just kind of fell off the plate. See what he's up to over the next couple weeks.
[304.57s -> 320.86s]  Nobody said more with a bunch of question marks. I don't know. We'll see. Who knows what's gonna
[320.86s -> 336.18s]  happen. You would like Ludwig? Hmm. Maybe I'll check him out. But yeah I was gonna chill tonight.
[336.18s -> 342.26s]  It's gonna be one of those of many more slowed down just kind of chill relaxed streams that I
[342.26s -> 349.80s]  talked about back in January. Just gonna play Mercenaries. Hang out. Chill. And that's all
[349.80s -> 361.61s]  there is to it. Chill on a horror game? Mercenaries is not really a horror game. Mercenaries is more
[361.61s -> 370.31s]  of a shooter game. Mercenaries is a wave shooting game mode that they put into Resident Evil 4.
[370.31s -> 386.30s]  So it's not really scary. It's just kind of fun. But let's do it. It's all jump scares over and
[386.30s -> 393.18s]  over again. Oh by the way I put like a I put a warning on the VOD. On the last VOD. I was
[393.18s -> 398.14s]  considering like doing a highlight to remove that really bad jump scare part but hopefully a warning
[398.14s -> 408.46s]  in the VOD is enough. Hopefully people saw it. It was a good warning. Okay. No no I'm not gonna
[408.46s -> 413.94s]  remove that. No no I was just making sure it was enough that people saw it. I'm not gonna remove
[413.94s -> 419.32s]  the VOD. I was gonna highlight the part of that out. But then it was gonna be kind of jarring. I
[419.32s -> 437.43s]  figured I figured a warning's probably enough. Don't you dare. The whole point of a jump scare
[437.43s -> 445.58s]  is that there's no warning. Uh I think a jump scare when you know a jump scare is possible
[445.58s -> 464.90s]  is different than when it just like attacks you out of nowhere for no reason. All right.
[464.90s -> 480.01s]  You guys ready? How did stir do that? That was my favorite part of the entire stream
[480.01s -> 486.12s]  a couple days ago was the incredible detective work that I did in one second
[487.00s -> 494.57s]  to accuse stir of doing that. There's so many layers as to how that happened. It's just
[496.18s -> 500.18s]  if you watch that whole segment that whole five minutes before that segment
[500.98s -> 507.42s]  that whole thing and like a minute or two after that it's just everything in my brain was you
[507.42s -> 517.98s]  could even see I'm like oh you you you did that you piece of shit it was it was just the way that
[517.98s -> 525.98s]  like the turn turn up the volume on stir's uh stir's discord to hey dude he's quiet he's quiet
[526.06s -> 532.63s]  dude stir even screams right before I turn him up he go I'm like oh stir's quiet he goes
[534.23s -> 537.75s]  and then it goes so it's like holy shit there's no way you didn't do that
[540.25s -> 547.05s]  and then he laughs he like laughs at it is so unbelievable just how much I could have
[547.05s -> 552.41s]  I thought it was him it's so so funny like just how I thought that I mean the jumps get sucked
[553.05s -> 557.61s]  and obviously I hope that that's not something I ever want to have to show anybody
[557.61s -> 564.26s]  unprompted but the whole thing leading up to that and after that of my accusal
[564.26s -> 577.78s]  of stir I think is my favorite part so far wrap it up Albertson hey you need to apologize
[580.60s -> 593.51s]  I did all right you guys ready let's just play here it is so I think you have to unlock stuff
[594.15s -> 600.89s]  yeah okay so you gotta unlock stuff so I'm gonna do village first obviously we have four characters
[602.95s -> 610.92s]  there's Leon I wonder who else is even in this because I know that I don't want to say anything
[610.92s -> 618.17s]  what if you've never seen this is this battle royale it is not they they give you more stuff
[618.17s -> 636.09s]  this time don't they okay well I know who these are this is uh Lewis what's this guy's name
[636.73s -> 639.03s]  so there's the um
[643.48s -> 651.03s]  Lewis this is hunk what I what I can't I can't think of this guy's name why not Kramer
[652.39s -> 660.86s]  Krauser yeah Krauser Krauser Lewis all right let's go so how this works is you just kind of
[660.86s -> 669.27s]  shoot run around and pick up stuff you get a time limit defeat as many enemies as possible
[669.27s -> 672.47s]  within the time limit taking them out in quick stitch mode from a combo they'll earn you points
[672.47s -> 676.82s]  yeah you want to keep a combo together so we're just gonna get the swing of it again
[677.38s -> 691.56s]  it's been a while you get seconds added all right you also want to make sure you keep combos don't
[691.56s -> 706.57s]  kill everybody because you might run out of people to kill oops where are they I remember back in the
[706.57s -> 713.34s]  day getting a I think it was like more it was an insane combo I forget what I used to be able to
[713.34s -> 731.62s]  get what is mayhem mode what is going on you can go it's like extra fast attack speed and more time
[735.22s -> 740.94s]  so you build up the mayhem meter oh wait add this power up still I think no don't lose the
[740.94s -> 752.68s]  combo no good okay we're good I don't even think about it where's the barrel there's a barrel here
[752.68s -> 763.29s]  somewhere right here all right get some people to come through here and I'm gonna blow this up
[763.93s -> 788.26s]  shoot the barrel we're good we're good oh all right mayhem mode go oh I'm kind of lagging
[788.26s -> 813.93s]  oh shit I'm out of bullets all right big enemy coming oh my god I didn't see him oh my god
[813.93s -> 826.20s]  how do I heal like of course I know how to heal shit okay go go go go get off me
[827.56s -> 843.00s]  all right I'm fine mayhem mode shotgun I gotta get a 50 combo right oh what's this

[1925.82s -> 1934.22s]  so I have a question if the time runs out versus dying if I die it's over right
[1934.94s -> 1950.50s]  or do I still get the point it's the same thing all right I'm actually not as concerned though
[1954.82s -> 1963.74s]  those guys gotta die and I don't even know where they are nice I gotta run where are they where's
[1963.74s -> 1996.66s]  it coming from right there oh shit that's bad throwing up throw throw throw throw yeah I think

[2043.21s -> 2051.86s]  million here I'm definitely going for one million I guess we're good spot all right there's the
[2051.86s -> 2068.18s]  cannon I killed everybody everybody's just dead where is that what wait oh I killed everybody
[2073.38s -> 2085.16s]  I killed everybody what holy shit I'm running around looking for to get to the next position
[2085.16s -> 2105.37s]  but I killed every single enemy damn oh I got Krauser and the island where's your score
[2106.31s -> 2126.23s]  yeah let's go that's pretty good all right what is um let's Krauser oh Krauser has the oh that's
[2126.23s -> 2133.85s]  right I want a bunch of oh and a machine gun I feel like I'm not going to be very good with
[2133.85s -> 2152.23s]  this character that's right he's got the uh the Las Plagas arm right okay during mayhem mode he
[2152.23s -> 2167.11s]  mutates and can deal close quarters attacks with left with rust with both that seems amazing I
[2167.11s -> 2173.18s]  think this one so far is my favorite all right let's try this I feel like I'm going to do pretty
[2173.18s -> 2185.05s]  bad here let's see so this is explosive arrows I only get three shots with that I don't think
[2185.05s -> 2197.27s]  I want to do that okay let's go I'm really not a big submachine gun fan in any of these games
[2198.44s -> 2201.08s]  as you've seen through through the first playthrough you saw here
[2202.44s -> 2224.31s]  use the knife where is it on the bar wait just regular melee swinging oh okay I thought it was
[2224.31s -> 2243.43s]  like something all right all right okay that's kind of amazing I need to reload my weapons that
[2243.43s -> 2275.22s]  would be great I'm gonna save it that's not a knife what oh die already die already I missed
[2275.22s -> 2281.96s]  every how they hit every single spot around his head I think I'm gonna lose the
[2283.00s -> 2298.26s]  I'm gonna lose the combo combo is I did that just to keep the combo I thought he was dead
[2298.82s -> 2328.41s]  I'm not doing it yet all right I'll do it now holy shit all right stinger is both left trigger

[3555.94s -> 3573.24s]  I thought I was dead you threw two grenades at your feet well because if I threw if I threw it
[3573.24s -> 3578.28s]  any further I thought I was gonna just overshoot everybody so right there I knew I in my mind
[3578.84s -> 3582.84s]  I'm dead I was just going for points because I was like I'm dead here no matter what
[3583.48s -> 3599.88s]  that was fun though cool hey I'm happy with every single attempt has been an S

[3638.81s -> 3647.37s]  layout is here how do I go up there's a very specific ladder to go up all right let me get
[3647.37s -> 3659.35s]  all the let me try a new strategy here S plus plus is the highest dude really I don't think
[3659.35s -> 3666.97s]  you should even shoot anything until you get all the bonuses try that strategy just hide somewhere
[3668.82s -> 3688.62s]  where where are all the greens I'm kind of wasting time uh restart it where are the greens I guess
[3688.62s -> 3698.25s]  it's good to kind of memorize that this is a uh this is a who cares run there's one in here
[3699.91s -> 3715.94s]  oh they it's random uh okay they move around well never mind let's just play you may lay a
[3715.94s -> 3722.04s]  crouch down staggered enemy with hunk oh I'm always so afraid to get in close to do a melee
[3722.04s -> 3726.36s]  on the big scary enemies I always feel like I'm gonna screw it up and they're gonna kill me in
[3726.36s -> 3758.49s]  one hit try to go let's see if I hold on I'm gonna try this um you grabbed me instead of whatever
[3758.49s -> 3800.04s]  so that's a big aoe okay cool dude that was somebody's grandma oh that is pretty good

[3879.77s -> 3894.46s]  even more than that all right go go go go go go go go is that an instant kill
[3895.10s -> 3905.77s]  all right it's not an instant kill versus the big people let's go up I don't want to lose the
[3907.74s -> 3925.29s]  shit oh it has to be the next snap okay what's this every grenade good I just have to help no

[6955.40s -> 6971.00s]  not even on the leaderboard if it's not s plus plus probably not uh I'm curious can you show

[7063.46s -> 7090.26s]  time to item collect I already unlocked the hand cannon yeah I thought I did it just cost

[7154.02s -> 7174.92s]  all right no my character is definitely uh Krauser for sure Krauser's probably everybody's character
[7175.64s -> 7187.93s]  considering he's hunk is really good but I like the special on Krauser better we can't have you

[7738.49s -> 7743.06s]  I mean I would I would say it's more like bail from Diablo 2 you just put all right put some
[7743.06s -> 7748.10s]  filters on that put some echo on it and some kind of grunge on it and that will be when you stand
[7748.10s -> 7763.59s]  still in the uh the what the world sanctuary wherever it is and it goes like right that's
[7763.59s -> 7781.70s]  what I would have said my brothers will not die in vain vain vain yeah here's bail's laugh okay
[7781.70s -> 7810.94s]  let's let's see let's compare it my brothers will not have died in vain uh you know I always thought
[7810.94s -> 7840.62s]  I was a bail you know I was gonna pick what Diablo character enough I gotta s with everybody on here
[7840.62s -> 7856.68s]  I know everyone's saying dude um excuse me Leon's not my character somebody wanted to see hunk again
[7858.28s -> 7870.55s]  uh we'll play hunk here what am I gonna do after this um I don't know I kind of just
[7870.55s -> 7875.14s]  planned on playing whatever I didn't this wasn't gonna be like a super duper long long stream or
[7875.14s -> 7885.02s]  anything I just was I'll pivot to something else maybe uh probably not breath of the wild I was
[7885.02s -> 7895.22s]  thinking about that but my switch is not um not set up right now I played um I don't know I just
[7895.22s -> 7898.98s]  took the switch into bed because it was well breath of the wild I was playing it that's cool
[7900.52s -> 7911.29s]  and I kind of just started playing random switch games and one of those random games I was playing
[7911.29s -> 7924.36s]  the Wario where uh for Game Boy Advance didn't I stream that game a while ago vampire survivors
[7924.92s -> 7936.86s]  I played a lot of the DLC off camera so I have seen it already play some n64 games
[7937.50s -> 7956.55s]  I'm down for that I'm gonna lose the combo do the hitman freelancer I would I promise you I would
[7956.55s -> 7961.91s]  I just don't have hitman installed right now and that game is like 700 million gigabytes and I don't
[7961.91s -> 7965.83s]  really I think I can really install it on stream I probably could but it would take like 20 minutes
[7965.83s -> 7981.19s]  or so 30 minutes that one down I wonder can you turn off the power or do you just store it
[7995.06s -> 8016.78s]  crew crew um maybe hmm maybe someone's probably gonna drop behind me
[8017.50s -> 8054.17s]  oh we're good nobody spawned I need to break some more necks okay let me get this actually
[8055.29s -> 8072.89s]  let's just do it again why not come on what's with the stun lock there we go all right I got
[8072.89s -> 8090.14s]  plenty of time I don't need time anymore oh shit just deal with that what about dos
[8092.42s -> 8099.69s]  hmm after uh after I do this one we'll take a look what we have for options
[8099.69s -> 8114.33s]  there's something else like an hour or two where are you there you are break his neck I actually
[8114.33s -> 8154.47s]  don't mind being down here easy don't even fall Nelson right now please collect and then I'm
[8154.47s -> 8182.09s]  gonna go out this way no I gotta get the hundred combo yes I'm gonna use a couple grenades oh
[8182.09s -> 8190.18s]  shit those things kill you instantly yes they do I may have just blown it I completely forgot
[8190.18s -> 8210.04s]  those things kill you instantly I'm good all right crisis absolutely averted right there I'm
[8210.04s -> 8242.06s]  gonna lose the combo or am I nope I'm not that guy just annihilated me okay getting there 100
[8242.06s -> 8269.18s]  where are the others where are the others I didn't want to use this for no reason okay
[8269.18s -> 8283.46s]  it's done it's the last one there's one more person I don't know oh they did it did it
[8290.68s -> 8308.94s]  shit oops good all right I think I'm gonna stick right here till the end I'll have mayhem mode
[8309.66s -> 8323.13s]  I might be able to actually get 150 this is actually a big deal hold on I got really scared
[8323.13s -> 8360.95s]  there that's my own fault all right here we go oh shit oh this is the one this is the one this is
[8360.95s -> 8415.00s]  the one come on I did it where's the last enemy where's the last enemy oh oh my god yes holy
[8415.00s -> 8423.75s]  shit oh I did it oh that's thank god oh my god I thought I was gonna miss it big time right there
[8423.75s -> 8436.62s]  at the end there it is nice youtuber reaction that was real that made it may have sounded fake
[8437.34s -> 8440.71s]  that was genuine I was about to get really really sad
[8441.51s -> 8472.79s]  can I register my name yeah it's thinking 1.1 mil 1.1 mil 1.1 million does anybody know what
[8472.79s -> 8492.68s]  the maximum score is check the leaderboards dude I'm the 10,611th best gamer in the world
[8494.73s -> 8511.90s]  on island with hunk in Resident Evil 4 remake why am I on there twice that's funny 10
[8515.93s -> 8523.70s]  you know what's really kind of wild about this that was hard that was like really challenging
[8523.70s -> 8529.14s]  really hard there are so many people that are so good at this shit it's unbelievable
[8529.78s -> 8540.79s]  well I don't know if I'm gonna do much better than that look at number one
[8545.42s -> 8565.46s]  a village how do I go by ranking how do I sort it tab so 2.5 million is the highest you can
[8565.46s -> 8582.14s]  possibly get that's probably everywhere 2.5 million 2.5 million 2.5 million it's all leons too
[8582.86s -> 8597.08s]  probably because the point multiplier for leon it's crazy what s plus plus does so all of my
[8597.08s -> 8605.10s]  s pluses are like oh I think I think I did a pretty good job 46,000 but if you get an s plus plus you
[8605.10s -> 8616.90s]  almost instantly teleport up to like the top 10,000 that's kind of interesting so what's the
[8616.90s -> 8626.55s]  next layer then I guess let's see looks like 1.1 seems to be the highest to get out of here I wonder
[8628.07s -> 8637.34s]  let's go here let's do start at one so at what point does this become like most people are not
[8637.34s -> 8643.93s]  doing more than 2 million 2.1 seems to be a pretty hard cut off because then you got half a million
[8643.93s -> 8652.60s]  points that are only like seven slots that looks like two millions doable somewhere between 1.5 to
[8652.60s -> 8668.06s]  two is pretty doable it seems and these aren't even with full combos yeah seems like 1.5 1.5
[8668.06s -> 8676.76s]  is where all the the god gamers live that's definitely the case cool all right I'm going
[8676.76s -> 8682.78s]  to take a quick break that was really fun this was resident evil 4 remakes mercenaries mode
[8684.50s -> 8692.55s]  I heavily enjoyed it uh well I'll play something else for a little bit we'll figure it out when I
[8692.55s -> 8698.26s]  get back I'll take a look I'm gonna go pee I'm gonna get a drink and I'll see you guys in like
[8698.82s -> 8701.42s]  a few minutes five minutes maybe see you in a minute
[8756.15s -> 8772.98s]  oh my mic is still on you I'm just looking at my steam hot bike hot bike you know what's funny
[8772.98s -> 8781.30s]  anytime I go brb even if I know the mic is muted I don't do I don't talk until I'm out of the room
[8781.30s -> 8786.70s]  like if I have to burp or fart or something really bad I even if I mute it over here
[8786.70s -> 8793.30s]  I'm doing I'm not doing that till I'm out of the room I just don't sometimes I just don't trust it
[8793.30s -> 8814.58s]  I don't know but I'll uh all right I'm looking at my steam we heard it paranoid Perry well
[8815.22s -> 8823.48s]  let me tell you something if I'm not paranoid Perry and for some reason I'm sitting here
[8824.30s -> 8832.34s]  and I've ripped ass really really loud with a brb screen up you that you want to talk about a
[8832.34s -> 8840.38s]  clip that will be shared a hundred thousand times forever you guys you guys will link that to me
[8840.38s -> 8845.74s]  and hide it like oh hey dude um oh Diablo four is getting some uh some updates click this and it's
[8845.74s -> 8856.86s]  gonna be me farting with the brb screen you know I know what you guys are capable of all right I'll
[8856.86s -> 8857.50s]  be right back
