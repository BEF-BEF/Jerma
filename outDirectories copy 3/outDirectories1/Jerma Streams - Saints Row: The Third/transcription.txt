[6.26s -> 25.81s]  What's happening? Hey, I'm back on my part two of three of times where I'm going to disappear for like two and a half weeks, or one week or whatever. Ten days.
[25.81s -> 30.24s]  That was the second time in the last two months. There's gonna be one more.
[30.24s -> 36.44s]  Not right now though, don't worry. Got a couple weeks here of just chillin'.
[36.44s -> 57.73s]  Saints Row, yeah. Saints Row. You gotta pre-stream chat, guys. Pre-stream chat. I would start participating.
[57.73s -> 66.80s]  They hold a lot of power. Let me break it down.
[66.80s -> 74.04s]  Every time there's a stream, let's say a stream is scheduled for two o'clock.
[74.04s -> 80.22s]  Or four o'clock, whatever. Somewhere around like one to three p.m. I will come in here.
[80.22s -> 84.46s]  And I'll say, hey, what's up, guys? How are you? What's going on, everybody?
[84.46s -> 90.95s]  And we'll go, Jerma! Oh, Jerma, what's up, man? Oh my god, he's here! Oh my god, I'm such a huge fan.
[90.95s -> 94.13s]  Nobody says anything else negative or anything like that.
[94.13s -> 98.82s]  They're always very supportive. They never tell me to leave every time.
[98.82s -> 104.82s]  I don't see, in all capitals, leave anytime I write a message, which I don't get that, by the way.
[104.82s -> 112.59s]  Every time I've talked in the pre-stream chat, everybody just says leave at the same time.
[112.59s -> 122.05s]  Hey, this is my chat here, okay? If I want to poke in... Look, this is my house.
[124.31s -> 129.66s]  We literally did that today. Yeah, you do it every day.
[129.66s -> 139.07s]  Regardless of the mean nature of some of the pre-stream chat, we talk.
[139.07s -> 143.25s]  I kind of chill in the pre-stream for like 10 to 20 minutes, usually.
[143.25s -> 148.06s]  Well, I say that I write like three messages, but I'm there watching.
[148.06s -> 154.93s]  I put a poll up. Here's three or four games that I want to play.
[154.93s -> 156.93s]  Which one do you guys want to see?
[156.93s -> 160.93s]  So let me tell you what the non pre-stream chat viewers have missed out on.
[160.93s -> 165.74s]  They voted today for Saints Row 3.
[165.74s -> 170.18s]  There was Chivalry 2 was on that list. It got three votes.
[170.18s -> 172.18s]  I'm not making that up.
[172.18s -> 175.18s]  Out of, I think, one, maybe I think like two or three hundred people in pre-stream.
[175.18s -> 179.18s]  I think three people clicked Chivalry 2. I was very surprised.
[179.18s -> 187.28s]  I mean, I'm probably going to play at some point.
[187.28s -> 195.30s]  What's this emote? Germa cheesed. I don't know.
[195.30s -> 198.30s]  I don't know. I don't know what it is. I can't even see it.
[198.30s -> 206.37s]  What is it? I just see the text. I don't know why I can't see it.
[206.37s -> 210.21s]  What does it look like?
[210.21s -> 214.94s]  You uploaded it. I did not.
[214.94s -> 223.89s]  I have given my mods complete and total creative control for every single emote on BTTV.
[223.89s -> 231.02s]  I don't even know what they are.
[231.02s -> 234.77s]  You personally uploaded it.
[234.77s -> 240.77s]  But I've been away for a while working on stuff, doing some personal life things.
[240.77s -> 247.97s]  I'm sure some of you guys have seen the picture of me, what it looks like officiating a wedding.
[247.97s -> 253.27s]  I don't know where that photo is from. I'm going to. I didn't do that.
[253.27s -> 257.27s]  Very strange. Somebody. I mean, I got Photoshopped into that somehow.
[257.27s -> 268.58s]  People called me. People calling me priest Andy.
[268.58s -> 272.58s]  No, Community Jake got married. And that's kind of where it was.
[272.58s -> 276.58s]  I officiated Community Jake's wedding, which is crazy, right?
[276.58s -> 280.76s]  I've never done that before, but it was a beautiful ceremony.
[280.76s -> 283.76s]  Two really great people. So I was more than happy to.
[283.76s -> 290.90s]  No, I'm not. I'm not ordained.
[290.90s -> 299.20s]  Hey, I just want to ask, dude, what's wrong with you? Love the streams, by the way.
[299.20s -> 302.20s]  That's a loaded question. How do I answer that in five seconds?
[302.20s -> 306.21s]  Actually, I can. No, I could. I could answer that.
[306.21s -> 313.21s]  What's wrong? I ate Captain Crunch every day for like breakfast, lunch and dinner for about four straight years when I was a kid.
[313.21s -> 315.21s]  There you go. This is your answer.
[315.21s -> 322.99s]  I'm in. I'm a bell. I'm embellishing.
[322.99s -> 324.99s]  I did not have it. I'm kidding.
[324.99s -> 330.26s]  And only for I would say probably like a year or two years.
[330.26s -> 334.26s]  I ate Captain Crunch every single day. It's got vitamins in it.
[334.26s -> 339.18s]  That's not the only thing I ate.
[339.18s -> 343.18s]  People take the things I say here when I'm fucking around and they act like, Holy shit.
[343.18s -> 348.18s]  Of course, he's a weird guy. He ate Captain Crunch for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nobody would do that.
[348.18s -> 356.29s]  Nobody. I'm kidding. Who would do that?
[356.29s -> 367.08s]  This dude has a lack of neurons now. I do not have a lack of neurons.
[367.08s -> 373.28s]  Yeah. OK. OK. Lack of. Oh, he's got a lack of neurons.
[373.28s -> 377.28s]  He's killing. Oh, he killed all his brain cells by eating Captain Crunch.
[377.28s -> 383.27s]  How many times a week do you smoke weed? Yeah. Yeah. OK.
[383.27s -> 394.51s]  Don't don't come at me on the high road here. None. I don't do that.
[394.51s -> 400.18s]  Some of you do. This is PR. He's projecting, projecting on Megalo.
[400.18s -> 407.52s]  You're a bad influence. I really hope not.
[407.52s -> 411.14s]  Look, what the fuck is this emote?
[411.14s -> 417.05s]  I'm looking at the mod chat right now. This is what that is.
[417.05s -> 422.62s]  Who allowed that? Who allowed that? That shouldn't be allowed.
[422.62s -> 431.17s]  That's a horrible looking. Eat human, eat human food.
[431.17s -> 435.17s]  Guys, I eat plenty of greens, plenty of vegetables.
[435.17s -> 438.54s]  I have a pretty balanced diet.
[438.54s -> 444.61s]  I try to I try to eat not too much meat, but enough meat because I like I like meat.
[444.61s -> 452.42s]  Try to balance it out a little bit. Yeah, it's good to see you again.
[452.42s -> 456.04s]  I'll be back the next couple of weeks. I'll be here pretty normally.
[456.04s -> 459.60s]  Two, three times a week like you're used to.
[459.60s -> 468.81s]  Then, oh, we've got the German Baseball Association, which is I'm very excited about that.
[468.81s -> 473.81s]  And then we've got we've got the green screen stream, ladies and gentlemen, the green screen stream.
[473.81s -> 477.37s]  Thank you for all of your submissions.
[477.37s -> 480.93s]  There were thousands of submissions.
[480.93s -> 484.36s]  There's no way I'm going to be able to do them all.
[484.36s -> 489.36s]  They've been narrowed down to a a doable amount.
[489.36s -> 492.92s]  Had to narrow down thousands of these submissions.
[492.92s -> 499.17s]  So on June 30th, mark that on your calendar.
[499.17s -> 506.37s]  I will be in front of the green screen doing all of your favorite all of your favorite actions.
[506.37s -> 515.18s]  Also, something else really cool on the 27th.
[515.18s -> 525.98s]  So in two days from now, Miss Kip is running a smite tournament, a one hundred thousand dollar tournament.
[525.98s -> 534.26s]  I am a team captain. I am a team captain for this tournament.
[534.26s -> 543.65s]  Who's on the team? The team is.
[543.65s -> 550.34s]  OK, here we go. Me, Poke Lulz, Russell.
[550.34s -> 566.05s]  Sure for. And then the final contestant is NoCo with our coach being weakened.
[566.05s -> 570.02s]  This is going to be a good fucking team.
[570.02s -> 574.86s]  These are going to be cringe, Andy. I didn't even do anything.
[574.86s -> 582.91s]  Just watch just watch us just roll over the competition. OK.
[582.91s -> 586.30s]  Have you guys practiced? Not once.
[586.30s -> 589.30s]  I, as team captain, have called for a practice.
[589.30s -> 596.66s]  I wrote a I literally wrote a paragraph and nobody responded.
[596.66s -> 607.65s]  I think we're going to hopefully get together at least.
[607.65s -> 609.65s]  Look, can we type practice? Right.
[609.65s -> 619.42s]  I wonder if that would work. Is typing practice?
[619.42s -> 623.42s]  What? OK, in in a in a discord group, right?
[623.42s -> 626.94s]  Just kind of be like, all right, so you go down that way.
[626.94s -> 628.94s]  You got out. Well, do we have to actually do it?
[628.94s -> 643.24s]  I think most people in the competition, I don't think I don't know if there's very many people that are really amazing at the game.
[643.24s -> 646.24s]  I don't I don't know. I know what some of the teams by now.
[646.24s -> 649.24s]  There's a lot of people involved. I mean, I think we've got a pretty good shot.
[649.24s -> 652.24s]  Have you guys seen? Have you guys seen my Anubis?
[652.24s -> 655.24s]  You guys have watched me not miss a single mummify.
[655.24s -> 661.04s]  I'm telling you right. This picks and bans.
[661.04s -> 663.41s]  They let me get Anubis. It's fucking over.
[663.41s -> 670.34s]  It's over. I don't know what their plan is to broadcast.
[670.34s -> 673.34s]  I think I'm sure there'll be people probably commenting it.
[673.34s -> 677.16s]  I don't know. Should be really fun. Sounds like a fun team.
[677.16s -> 684.26s]  Who else was I good at? I remember those.
[684.26s -> 686.26s]  You don't know that Anubis got nerfed. That doesn't matter.
[686.26s -> 690.72s]  I could be the worst God in the game and I'd still do all right with it.
[690.72s -> 696.99s]  You're Anubis. Guys, it's this is all psychological.
[696.99s -> 703.99s]  OK, if everybody thinks that I'm really fucking good with this character, then they're going to freak out.
[703.99s -> 705.99s]  Just shut up. I have a plan.
[705.99s -> 708.99s]  You don't understand the psychology here.
[708.99s -> 713.13s]  The more I talk about Anubis, they're going to fucking ban Anubis.
[713.13s -> 715.13s]  And who gives a shit? That character sucks.
[715.13s -> 717.13s]  Do you get it? Are you understanding this now?
[717.13s -> 720.13s]  Can you please just relax and let me do what I'm doing as a team captain?
[720.13s -> 725.42s]  For God's sakes, would you let me do what I'm doing as a team captain?
[725.42s -> 730.10s]  Quiet enough. I don't want you to screw this up for me.
[730.10s -> 736.16s]  And then good. Look, all you guys are going to go to the other teams.
[736.16s -> 739.16s]  He's actually the Anubis thing is a joke.
[739.16s -> 741.16s]  And then they won't ban Anubis.
[741.16s -> 744.16s]  And then I get like 20 kills in one game with Anubis.
[744.16s -> 749.00s]  It's all psychology. I'm glad you guys get it.
[749.00s -> 757.36s]  He wants the money.
[760.84s -> 764.34s]  I just want to I think I thought it was a fun idea.
[764.34s -> 768.50s]  All right, you guys ready? Let's get going.
[768.50s -> 771.50s]  It's good to see everybody. Hope you're all doing well.
[771.50s -> 777.37s]  Did I tweet? I did. He wants the money.
[777.37s -> 780.44s]  So this is Saints Row 3.
[780.44s -> 783.44s]  I have never played Saints Row 3, just like when it was Saints Row 2.
[783.44s -> 786.74s]  I think maybe I was in the menu.
[786.74s -> 788.74s]  Maybe I went to the first area. I don't know.
[788.74s -> 792.84s]  I don't have any memory of playing it.
[792.84s -> 794.84s]  But there's your plan for the week.
[794.84s -> 799.14s]  We got bang Saints Row 3 tonight.
[799.14s -> 804.14s]  27th Smite hundred thousand dollar tournament, which we are guaranteed to win.
[804.14s -> 807.45s]  And then the 30th green screen.
[807.45s -> 811.45s]  Let's go. Stacked fucking week. Stacked week.
[811.45s -> 816.95s]  OK, let's go. Saints Row.
[816.95s -> 828.58s]  Can you hear it? We can now.
[828.58s -> 831.66s]  Can you see me?
[831.66s -> 835.02s]  You know, I guess notice I've been doing face cam every single day now.
[835.02s -> 837.02s]  That's complete. That's unheard of.
[837.02s -> 843.26s]  Can you guys remember a time when I ever did this?
[843.26s -> 846.65s]  And I don't even know why I'm doing it. You know what I mean?
[846.65s -> 848.65s]  I don't even know why I started doing this.
[848.65s -> 858.14s]  It just I just sort of started doing this.
[858.14s -> 866.30s]  Right. I was a no face cam guy forever for almost 10 straight years.
[866.30s -> 869.30s]  And then I played Elden Ring and kept the face cam on.
[869.30s -> 871.30s]  And now it's just on permanently.
[871.30s -> 875.27s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't even want this on.
[875.27s -> 880.27s]  I don't want this on. And I'm going to turn it off immediately if I get if I feel like it.
[880.27s -> 883.77s]  The second that I don't care anymore, it's going off like I'm a weirdo.
[883.77s -> 885.94s]  Whatever. All right, let's go. New campaign.
[885.94s -> 887.94s]  Normal. We're not playing hardcore.
[887.94s -> 891.27s]  How is it? Is it loud? How loud is it?
[891.27s -> 899.53s]  That looks fine. 60.
[899.53s -> 902.60s]  All right. Quiet. Here comes the opening cutscene.
[902.60s -> 909.51s]  Quiet. This game has DMCA songs.
[909.51s -> 911.51s]  I don't I don't even care.
[911.51s -> 917.70s]  I'm sorry. I just don't anymore.
[917.70s -> 921.70s]  Conquest. That's what we're playing, by the way, in the Smite one hundred thousand dollar tournament.
[921.70s -> 923.70s]  It's Conquest 5v5.
[923.70s -> 931.87s]  We're not doing an arena. I haven't played Conquest in five years at least.
[931.87s -> 935.89s]  We're going to lose.
[935.89s -> 939.32s]  If I play mage and I do mid, I'm going to miss every rotation.
[939.32s -> 941.32s]  I'm probably going to go 0 and 15 or something.
[941.32s -> 947.53s]  No, I don't think so. I think I'll be all right.
[947.53s -> 950.98s]  Dude, you suck at Smite.
[950.98s -> 951.98s]  No, I don't.
[951.98s -> 956.78s]  I don't suck at Smite.
[956.78s -> 959.78s]  Okay.
[959.78s -> 963.78s]  Loading into a game that you haven't loaded for two or three straight years
[963.78s -> 970.78s]  and you jump into Conquest when the meta has changed completely is you can't.
[970.78s -> 973.78s]  It's not just like getting back in there and just, oh, yeah, I'm going to go 10 and 0.
[973.78s -> 975.78s]  No matter what, that's not going to happen. You're going to lose.
[975.78s -> 986.81s]  I stream the game one fucking time and get my ass kicked by a bunch of other people that we're playing every day.
[986.81s -> 989.30s]  I'll be just fine.
[989.30s -> 1003.22s]  What about the lore? Energy drink?
[1003.22s -> 1022.59s]  Can I do that? What?
[1022.59s -> 1029.87s]  Oh, it's an ad. Okay.
[1029.87s -> 1032.87s]  Japanese commercials. Easiest money you'll ever make.
[1032.87s -> 1035.87s]  Grand Lawson is right up there. You ready for this?
[1035.87s -> 1037.87s]  Is this 30 FPS?
[1037.87s -> 1040.74s]  I do my own stunts.
[1040.74s -> 1042.74s]  Hey, you're just a ride along, man.
[1042.74s -> 1044.74s]  What the hell?
[1044.74s -> 1046.74s]  I am a method actor.
[1046.74s -> 1053.30s]  If I'm going to play a saint with any degree of emotional truth, I got to make it real.
[1053.30s -> 1057.78s]  Is this 30 FPS?
[1057.78s -> 1060.18s]  It'll be real.
[1060.18s -> 1062.18s]  You're robbing a bank dressed like yourselves.
[1062.18s -> 1065.18s]  Hell yeah. Who doesn't want to be Johnny yet?
[1065.18s -> 1068.18s]  Ultra postmodernism.
[1068.18s -> 1074.36s]  Who cares if it's 30 FPS?
[1074.36s -> 1076.36s]  But do we really got to drag this asshole actor around?
[1076.36s -> 1079.36s]  Cut Josh some slack. He's just researching his part.
[1079.36s -> 1081.36s]  I hope he signed a waiver.
[1081.36s -> 1083.36s]  Alright, people.
[1083.36s -> 1088.59s]  But he died.
[1088.59s -> 1090.59s]  Sorry, jumps his line. Can we go again?
[1090.59s -> 1092.59s]  You all know the drill.
[1092.59s -> 1094.59s]  This game came out in the 60s. No, it didn't.
[1094.59s -> 1096.59s]  What are you talking about?
[1096.59s -> 1098.59s]  Can I get a picture with the boss?
[1098.59s -> 1100.59s]  Say sleaze.
[1100.59s -> 1102.59s]  Get in line, bitch.
[1102.59s -> 1104.59s]  Hey, don't be a dick.
[1104.59s -> 1106.59s]  Do you call yourself gang bangers?
[1106.59s -> 1108.59s]  You're a bunch of pussies.
[1108.59s -> 1116.63s]  We should be all up in there shit like fuck.
[1116.63s -> 1119.51s]  I don't know. That's different.
[1119.51s -> 1121.51s]  This game is older than you. It is not.
[1121.51s -> 1128.28s]  We're just shooting all these words to me.
[1128.28s -> 1133.85s]  Wait, it's time to play?
[1133.85s -> 1138.38s]  Is it time to play?
[1138.38s -> 1140.38s]  Okay, now it's 60 FPS.
[1140.38s -> 1144.54s]  What's happening?
[1144.54s -> 1146.54s]  I thought that was a fucking person.
[1146.54s -> 1153.06s]  The one thing that I shoot at.
[1153.06s -> 1156.06s]  I have it on ultra graphics, by the way.
[1156.06s -> 1159.01s]  Let's find that bomb.
[1159.01s -> 1162.78s]  Can I switch between people?
[1162.78s -> 1171.34s]  Alright, where do I go?
[1171.34s -> 1173.34s]  Is there a melee? What's melee?
[1176.12s -> 1179.45s]  We can't go in? Alright, let's go.
[1179.45s -> 1185.83s]  What's melee?
[1186.83s -> 1188.83s]  Okay.
[1192.58s -> 1194.58s]  Is there screen shake?
[1194.58s -> 1196.58s]  It's not really.
[1196.58s -> 1199.20s]  It's barely screen shake.
[1205.78s -> 1208.21s]  The audio sounds weird to me.
[1208.21s -> 1213.52s]  I gotta change the audio.
[1213.52s -> 1216.59s]  The audio sounds weird, right?
[1230.67s -> 1233.17s]  You know what I was trying to do.
[1233.17s -> 1237.44s]  Audio shake.
[1237.44s -> 1240.77s]  How do you sprint?
[1240.77s -> 1248.75s]  Alright, go upstairs.
[1248.75s -> 1251.50s]  Shift? I got a controller. How do I do it?
[1251.50s -> 1258.29s]  Left bumper?
[1258.29s -> 1260.29s]  No. It's already way too big.
[1263.55s -> 1265.55s]  Why are you not playing the remaster?
[1265.55s -> 1267.55s]  I didn't even know the remaster existed.
[1267.55s -> 1269.55s]  There's a remaster for Saints Row 3?
[1269.55s -> 1275.57s]  Is there really?
[1277.57s -> 1279.57s]  I didn't know.
[1279.57s -> 1281.57s]  Why the fuck would I know this?
[1293.24s -> 1295.67s]  Alright, let's go.
[1297.67s -> 1303.29s]  What just happened?
[1303.29s -> 1305.29s]  Where's my weapon wheel? Give me the weapon wheel.
[1305.29s -> 1317.70s]  Alright, let's go.
[1317.70s -> 1324.79s]  Let's move, move, move.
[1324.79s -> 1331.50s]  Am I signing an autograph?
[1331.50s -> 1335.46s]  Why the hell am I signing an autograph?
[1337.73s -> 1339.73s]  Make the head part of your face cam bigger.
[1339.73s -> 1343.73s]  No! We're gonna take these masks off in like 10 seconds.
[1343.73s -> 1359.28s]  Zoom your face in.
[1359.28s -> 1362.54s]  Alright, chopper.
[1362.54s -> 1370.10s]  Now what an idiot. He pressed the alarm button.
[1379.78s -> 1384.57s]  Now what?
[1384.57s -> 1386.57s]  Alright, BLS.
[1386.57s -> 1388.57s]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[1388.57s -> 1390.57s]  What is this? Alright, let's defend.
[1390.57s -> 1392.57s]  How do I crouch? Left stick, I think, right?
[1392.57s -> 1397.30s]  Why would you do that?
[1397.30s -> 1399.86s]  Why would you do that?
[1399.86s -> 1401.86s]  This is a huge open area. Why would you do that?
[1401.86s -> 1404.87s]  That was completely and absolutely unnecessary.
[1404.87s -> 1406.87s]  No reason to do that.
[1406.87s -> 1414.23s]  But wait, come here.
[1414.23s -> 1420.25s]  Come on. I forgot how ugly this game is.
[1420.25s -> 1422.25s]  Does this game really actually have a remake?
[1422.25s -> 1426.73s]  What was it called?
[1426.73s -> 1433.83s]  Yes, it does.
[1433.83s -> 1440.42s]  What was it called?
[1440.42s -> 1442.42s]  Saints Row the Third Remaster.
[1442.42s -> 1449.45s]  It's trash.
[1449.45s -> 1457.43s]  Oh my god.
[1457.43s -> 1463.26s]  Do I even fit in health?
[1463.26s -> 1474.14s]  The remaster is actually bad.
[1474.14s -> 1480.09s]  Is it really?
[1480.09s -> 1490.46s]  Pick up the shield. I'm out.
[1490.46s -> 1494.23s]  I'm out of bullets.
[1494.23s -> 1496.23s]  I don't think I can die in this.
[1496.23s -> 1498.23s]  I literally can't die. I'm being lit up by a Gatling gun on a helicopter.
[1498.23s -> 1500.23s]  Minus two, what?
[1500.23s -> 1507.91s]  I can't die.
[1507.91s -> 1509.91s]  I can't die.
[1509.91s -> 1515.16s]  It's just minor graphic improvements.
[1515.16s -> 1521.88s]  Germania? What are you talking about?
[1521.88s -> 1523.88s]  I haven't announced any wrestling stuff.
[1523.88s -> 1528.62s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[1528.62s -> 1535.27s]  Is the game volume too high or too low?
[1535.27s -> 1547.86s]  Too low.
[1547.86s -> 1551.43s]  Crank it.
[1551.43s -> 1557.64s]  Crank it.
[1557.64s -> 1559.64s]  You would not want to be firing.
[1559.64s -> 1561.94s]  What's happening?
[1561.94s -> 1570.90s]  Better? Alright.
[1570.90s -> 1578.78s]  Fucking crank it.
[1578.78s -> 1595.10s]  What?
[1595.10s -> 1599.62s]  What the fuck is happening?
[1599.62s -> 1607.56s]  This feels like a mobile game ad.
[1609.80s -> 1627.06s]  Crank it.
[1627.06s -> 1629.43s]  Not bad.
[1636.79s -> 1640.70s]  Which by the way, I gotta do the mobile game stream.
[1642.70s -> 1644.70s]  I was talking about that for a long time and I never did it.
[1644.70s -> 1647.77s]  We gotta do it.
[1647.77s -> 1651.16s]  We have to do it.
[1651.16s -> 1653.16s]  Is it weird that I want to buy a completely new iPad?
[1653.16s -> 1655.40s]  Because I feel like it's not going to ever work ever again.
[1657.40s -> 1661.43s]  Where we just play all the games that you get ads for.
[1661.43s -> 1663.43s]  All the mobile games you get ads for.
[1663.43s -> 1667.27s]  Play them all.
[1667.27s -> 1669.27s]  And spend at least an hour in each one.
[1669.27s -> 1671.27s]  Or at least 20 minutes at least in each one.
[1671.27s -> 1677.54s]  I need to get a burner iPad for that.
[1677.54s -> 1681.77s]  Get a burner iPad.
[1681.77s -> 1688.42s]  Just emulate it?
[1688.42s -> 1693.98s]  What?
[1693.98s -> 1695.98s]  You can actually emulate it?
[1695.98s -> 1706.01s]  Alright, there we go.
[1706.01s -> 1708.01s]  You can get an Android OS emulator.
[1708.01s -> 1713.30s]  Really?
[1713.30s -> 1718.30s]  I didn't know that. That's cool.
[1718.30s -> 1720.30s]  Alright, let's customize the character now.
[1722.73s -> 1724.73s]  Here we go.
[1724.73s -> 1729.21s]  We're making the McRiddler.
[1729.21s -> 1733.80s]  If I can.
[1733.80s -> 1735.80s]  That doesn't look old.
[1735.80s -> 1739.70s]  That just looks kind of dehydrated.
[1739.70s -> 1741.70s]  This is before the glass of water.
[1741.70s -> 1745.67s]  And this is after the glass of water.
[1745.67s -> 1748.30s]  Sex appeal?
[1748.30s -> 1750.30s]  Okay, that's a dick.
[1750.30s -> 1753.11s]  You can just give the guy a huge dick.
[1753.11s -> 1755.11s]  I thought it was going to make me like handsome.
[1755.11s -> 1757.11s]  I didn't know that's what that was.
[1757.11s -> 1760.76s]  Okay.
[1760.76s -> 1763.32s]  That's fine.
[1763.32s -> 1765.62s]  Okay.
[1765.62s -> 1770.10s]  Build.
[1770.10s -> 1774.97s]  I'm going to try to make the McRiddler if I can.
[1774.97s -> 1776.97s]  Can I not?
[1776.97s -> 1793.53s]  Is there an advanced mode?
[1793.53s -> 1795.53s]  Oh yeah, that's right. I used hacks last time.
[1795.53s -> 1797.53s]  Oh no, I actually used hacks.
[1797.53s -> 1800.86s]  Fuck.
[1800.86s -> 1802.86s]  I did use hacks last time.
[1802.86s -> 1804.86s]  Damn it.
[1804.86s -> 1806.86s]  Oh, I can't do it. I don't have the hacks.
[1806.86s -> 1817.02s]  It's alright.
[1817.02s -> 1827.19s]  How hard is it to get the hacks?
[1827.19s -> 1830.33s]  Do they exist?
[1830.33s -> 1838.97s]  Scroll down on the skins.
[1838.97s -> 1850.30s]  You can make your guy made out of emerald?
[1850.30s -> 1859.94s]  I kind of want to do that.
[1859.94s -> 1862.18s]  Okay, that's whatever.
[1862.18s -> 1866.41s]  I'm going to get so sick of this though.
[1866.41s -> 1870.18s]  He's a Minecraft diamond.
[1870.18s -> 1873.13s]  He's a Minecraft diamond.
[1873.13s -> 1875.13s]  That's fucking hilarious.
[1887.48s -> 1890.81s]  Minecraft diamond.
[1890.81s -> 1892.81s]  Without the sliders,
[1892.81s -> 1894.81s]  I didn't think they were going to exist for this game.
[1894.81s -> 1901.91s]  Make him Mr. Emerald.
[1901.91s -> 1903.91s]  No, he's Minecraft diamond.
[1903.91s -> 1925.08s]  Mr. Green?
[1925.08s -> 1927.90s]  No, he's not Mr. Green.
[1927.90s -> 1931.42s]  I know what Mr. Green looks like.
[1931.42s -> 1935.38s]  I wonder how he's doing.
[1935.38s -> 1938.14s]  I wonder if we'll ever see him again.
[1938.14s -> 1943.88s]  In person.
[1943.88s -> 1946.87s]  I wonder if we'll ever see him
[1946.87s -> 1949.11s]  in person doing something.
[1949.11s -> 1953.70s]  I don't know. Maybe not.
[1953.70s -> 1956.58s]  It depends on what Mr. Green is up to.
[1956.58s -> 1962.73s]  Alright, let's do the ears.
[1962.73s -> 1985.45s]  This is just the Silver Surfer.
[1985.45s -> 1989.67s]  What did the Silver Surfer do?
[1989.67s -> 1992.36s]  What was his thing?
[1992.36s -> 1994.36s]  He came in and marked the planets.
[1994.36s -> 1996.36s]  For the big guy to eat.
[1996.36s -> 2011.70s]  Isn't that what it was?
[2011.70s -> 2013.70s]  Not wrong? That's what it was, right?
[2013.70s -> 2015.70s]  Whoa, what the fuck? I thought I hit accept.
[2015.70s -> 2031.13s]  My friend Joe is playing
[2031.13s -> 2033.13s]  Saints Row 3 right now. Can you say hi to him?
[2033.13s -> 2043.66s]  What's up, Joe?
[2043.66s -> 2054.28s]  This is going to get so irritating. You know what it is.
[2054.28s -> 2056.28s]  I don't know. Why do I feel like this is
[2056.28s -> 2058.28s]  popping up and asking me
[2058.28s -> 2060.28s]  a wish and I said, I want to be the most strong
[2060.28s -> 2062.28s]  super powered man in history.
[2062.28s -> 2065.80s]  You go like this and I would turn into that.
[2065.80s -> 2078.02s]  Like this would be what I turned into.
[2078.02s -> 2080.78s]  This dude's made out of resin.
[2080.78s -> 2082.78s]  Yeah, this guy's just going to lie down
[2082.78s -> 2086.36s]  on a wooden table.
[2086.36s -> 2088.36s]  Oh nice. Nice, dude.
[2088.36s -> 2111.46s]  Whoa, you can put their whole face up
[2111.46s -> 2118.50s]  or down? Resin.
[2118.50s -> 2122.98s]  Don't act like you have not fallen
[2122.98s -> 2124.98s]  asleep to resin poor videos.
[2124.98s -> 2127.42s]  Come on, dude. Really?
[2127.42s -> 2129.42s]  Don't act like you're better than the rest of us.
[2129.42s -> 2142.22s]  I want to have a really big mouth.
[2142.22s -> 2162.81s]  Okay, I like that better.
[2162.81s -> 2164.81s]  What's going on with his mouth?
[2164.81s -> 2183.93s]  Alright, I'm happy with it.
[2183.93s -> 2196.86s]  Let's suck the chin up though. Let's get like a
[2196.86s -> 2209.34s]  really fucking big turkey neck.
[2209.34s -> 2212.09s]  Alright, I'm happy with it. I'm not happy with the eyes
[2212.09s -> 2220.33s]  though. Getting there.
[2220.33s -> 2223.91s]  Getting there. Definitely getting there now.
[2223.91s -> 2245.34s]  I just don't care.
[2245.34s -> 2247.90s]  Oh my goodness. Okay.
[2247.90s -> 2259.98s]  Whoa.
[2259.98s -> 2262.28s]  Alright, maybe. Maybe.
[2262.28s -> 2272.52s]  Yeah, it's Dr. Manhattan's fucking
[2272.52s -> 2275.46s]  stepbrother.
[2275.46s -> 2290.12s]  Resin poor. No, not resin
[2290.12s -> 2292.12s]  porn. Resin poor.
[2292.12s -> 2296.86s]  I don't know if the hair is not doing it for me.
[2296.86s -> 2312.28s]  That's too easy though.
[2312.28s -> 2328.22s]  Should I just be bald?
[2328.22s -> 2332.38s]  I kind of like this.
[2332.38s -> 2341.34s]  Should I have like contrasting
[2341.34s -> 2343.51s]  hair? Or should I just be
[2343.51s -> 2345.51s]  No, not the German colors.
[2345.51s -> 2363.03s]  I don't know. What do you think? Make it
[2363.03s -> 2366.30s]  your hair color. I guess that
[2366.30s -> 2369.30s]  is kind of weird. Yeah, it is
[2369.30s -> 2371.30s]  weird. These kind of characters
[2371.30s -> 2373.30s]  never have facial hair.
[2373.30s -> 2380.92s]  They never have beards, right? Ever.
[2380.92s -> 2384.38s]  Can I make? You can't even see it.
[2384.38s -> 2400.62s]  I want a big beard.
[2400.62s -> 2403.18s]  Imagine Dr. Manhattan
[2403.18s -> 2405.67s]  with a goatee. It just doesn't
[2405.67s -> 2407.67s]  fucking work. It does not work.
[2407.67s -> 2423.42s]  Porn stash. You can't even see
[2423.42s -> 2429.80s]  it. Alright, what about if I do this?
[2429.80s -> 2433.06s]  I can't even see it. Hold on. This one's the most
[2433.06s -> 2435.06s]  full, but I need to do it. Okay, can we see it if we
[2435.06s -> 2442.55s]  change the color?
[2442.55s -> 2444.55s]  Doesn't it kind of look like he
[2444.55s -> 2451.85s]  painted his home with marker? It just
[2451.85s -> 2458.63s]  looks slightly more oiled.
[2458.63s -> 2460.63s]  It's just spray paint. Yeah, it's just spray paint.
[2460.63s -> 2464.01s]  Wait. Oh, that one
[2464.01s -> 2471.24s]  shows up. That looks like shit,
[2471.24s -> 2476.04s]  though. That looks awful. I
[2476.04s -> 2478.04s]  don't like this at all. I really don't like it.
[2478.04s -> 2493.14s]  I can't even see it. It doesn't matter.
[2493.14s -> 2517.96s]  You can't see this either.
[2517.96s -> 2538.17s]  Hold on. I don't hate it.
[2538.17s -> 2541.62s]  He looks like a fucking pro wrestler.
[2541.62s -> 2550.52s]  Turn the reflection off on the skin.
[2550.52s -> 2552.52s]  Dude, do you guys really care that much? I'm going to play this
[2552.52s -> 2554.52s]  for like five hours and never
[2554.52s -> 2556.70s]  install it ever again. Does it really matter?
[2556.70s -> 2579.85s]  Yeah, without, without.
[2579.85s -> 2581.85s]  I kind of like the glistening kind of
[2581.85s -> 2583.85s]  like car oil.
[2583.85s -> 2600.34s]  Yeah. Personality.
[2600.34s -> 2612.04s]  There's a McGriddler. No.
[2612.04s -> 2614.04s]  No. Nope. Nope.
[2614.04s -> 2616.04s]  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[2616.04s -> 2618.65s]  Nope. Nope.
[2618.65s -> 2620.65s]  No. No. No. Fuck that.
[2620.65s -> 2622.65s]  No. It's so easy.
[2622.65s -> 2624.65s]  This is the funny thing that everybody does.
[2624.65s -> 2626.95s]  This is the funny one.
[2626.95s -> 2631.48s]  No.
[2634.15s -> 2638.31s]  I don't
[2638.31s -> 2641.37s]  God damn it.
[2641.37s -> 2648.65s]  I don't
[2648.65s -> 2651.02s]  do it. Can I change it later?
[2651.02s -> 2657.93s]  Can I go back and change this if I want to?
[2657.93s -> 2663.67s]  I can. Fine.
[2663.67s -> 2671.61s]  I hate it already. I do this shit
[2671.61s -> 2674.87s]  all the time.
[2674.87s -> 2676.87s]  I will just be walking around my house and I'll just start
[2676.87s -> 2680.46s]  doing this. I swear to ask Holly.
[2680.46s -> 2682.46s]  I swear to God. Like I
[2682.46s -> 2687.19s]  do that. No. Not that.
[2687.19s -> 2692.79s]  No. Nope.
[2692.79s -> 2696.55s]  No. No.
[2698.55s -> 2706.30s]  I do that too.
[2706.30s -> 2726.89s]  I do that too.
[2726.89s -> 2729.06s]  We're just gonna do that.
[2729.06s -> 2731.06s]  I hate this character.
[2731.06s -> 2733.06s]  What's this character's name? I forget.
[2733.06s -> 2736.78s]  Resin? Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2736.78s -> 2738.78s]  wait. I'm excited. Okay. Yeah. This is it, right?
[2738.78s -> 2751.50s]  Resin table.
[2751.50s -> 2754.82s]  Resin four. That's his name.
[2754.82s -> 2756.82s]  I'm gonna turn it off now.
[2756.82s -> 2758.82s]  It's stupid. It's not even funny.
[2758.82s -> 2762.15s]  This was funny like 10 years ago.
[2762.15s -> 2768.92s]  to us. Burke's right. We traded our dicks in for pussies. Seriously, movie deals, commercials.
[2768.92s -> 2770.92s]  This is going to be the every single cutscene.
[2776.14s -> 2782.46s]  No, it's oh my god. It's always about the money, Mr. Gat, which is precisely why our employer
[2782.46s -> 2793.10s]  wishes to speak with you. If you'll indulge us. Sounds like you know it actually doesn't.
[2797.80s -> 2810.73s]  That's a tuber joke. Of course, a remarkable likeness. These visions are viola and kiki
[2810.73s -> 2814.33s]  and I am Philippe Laurent, chairman of a multinational organization called the
[2815.29s -> 2816.25s]  Taz impression.
[2816.71s -> 2842.01s]  I wonder why my foot's not up your ass at this point. Like it or not, Mr. Gat, our organization is expanding into still water. I am offering you the chance to leverage your assets against your lives. Ladies.
[2842.97s -> 2847.58s]  Worst dream 2022 because you don't like the zombie voice. Come on, relax.
[2855.58s -> 2857.58s]  No, it sucks.
[2869.77s -> 2880.90s]  What? No, you're going to get us all sucked out of the plane.
[2896.70s -> 2902.06s]  I can take them. What about the plane? I'll fly it back to still water.
[2903.58s -> 2912.71s]  I definitely can't even change it. What a mistake. Details. Details. Just cover the boss. Go. I got this.
[2916.95s -> 2924.15s]  Yes, that's right. Resin pour. Dr. Manhattan's step brother with the power of costing fifteen thousand dollars.
[2928.71s -> 2934.39s]  That's it. Attention passengers. This is your new captain speaking. Our updated flight plan has us
[2934.39s -> 2946.31s]  landed in still water. I'd like to remind all passengers to remain screen shake. Ah, fuck this fucking screen shake.
[2953.38s -> 2964.14s]  Here's some relaxing music for your enjoyment. Wait. Oh, let's go do it. There's all this fucking screen shake.
[2971.35s -> 2981.67s]  Find a parachute. All right, let's go. There's so many people. What are these people doing?
[2982.55s -> 2990.76s]  This fucking sensitivity is so low. God damn. What the fuck is going on? I don't have any guns.
[3009.46s -> 3021.50s]  What? Nice Minecraft aim. Dude, I'm. I'm holding. Look, I am holding down right now.
[3021.50s -> 3038.62s]  Holding up. It's like pitching an airplane. Let's go. Resin hands.
[3059.29s -> 3070.68s]  I love how he goes off camera for cutscenes like any of us care. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I'm just
[3070.76s -> 3120.36s]  used to doing it. What the fuck? This is so stupid. Flip. Flip. Flip. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload.
[3125.61s -> 3139.86s]  How can I go faster? Oh shit. That hurt. Can I get hurt? All right. That hurts. What is going on?
[3148.30s -> 3176.17s]  Got you. I can't change it. It's over. Oh, man. Why the fuck did I listen to the
[3176.17s -> 3183.48s]  10 people telling me to do that? What's going on? Do I have to do something?
[3183.48s -> 3220.22s]  Am I supposed to press a button? Dude, what the fuck? What? That guy's just going to die.
[3221.88s -> 3240.26s]  Oh, no, they're not. What is this guy doing? Skip the cutscenes. This whole thing is a cutscene.
[3240.26s -> 3253.70s]  It's the tutorial at the beginning of the game, man. This is the original, I think. I actually
[3253.70s -> 3257.94s]  have no idea. I just bought Saints Row the third. That's it. I didn't know anything else.
[3259.86s -> 3262.90s]  I wasn't looking for a remaster. I didn't think they were going to remaster this game.
[3273.59s -> 3280.18s]  We're falling for a really long time. Don't you only really fall when you skydive 30 seconds or
[3280.18s -> 3298.18s]  something? Don't you only fall for 20 seconds? No. Three minutes? Why do I feel like
[3298.98s -> 3308.90s]  you just get sucked to the ground wicked fast? Are you on drugs? How high do you jump out of a plane?
[3309.38s -> 3313.46s]  And the Saints are not welcome. When you skydive. I don't know. How high do you go?
[3318.70s -> 3336.78s]  14,000 feet? And leave them nothing. Not as high as you are right now. I am sober.
[3338.06s -> 3349.62s]  Sober. Oh, there's a phone. Okay. Stop leaving. We don't care about the cutscenes. Try to skip
[3349.62s -> 3355.98s]  the cutscenes. But I'm not going to know what's going on. All right, let's go.
[3358.73s -> 3374.63s]  Steal a car. How do I put the gun away? Don't skip cutscenes.
[3378.30s -> 3382.22s]  Steal part. It's kind of like Bangkok's abusive father. Access cell phone map.
[3384.22s -> 3391.80s]  Oh my fucking god. Get rid of it now. Okay. So this wants me to go see the GPS. Set the GPS to the
[3391.80s -> 3396.94s]  what over here. Okay. Set GPS. Sounds good. Let's go.
[3415.90s -> 3418.54s]  I feel like that should not have. Look, where the fuck are we going?
[3419.18s -> 3421.90s]  What the fuck? That wasn't even a road.
[3421.90s -> 3428.34s]  It has GPS, right? Check your map. I think you can get Luigi. Okay, you can actually get Luigi.
[3430.10s -> 3437.02s]  Jump or dive. Yeah, we raid the guard armory. What the fuck was that?
[3438.46s -> 3444.62s]  You can't be serious. Oh my god. Shut it off. How do I get rid of it?
[3444.62s -> 3452.57s]  Oh, a shitty idea. I thought this lady farted.
[3455.29s -> 3456.73s]  Like I scared the shit out of her.
[3462.01s -> 3470.34s]  I was like, what? I thought she farted. I really, I honestly thought she farted.
[3471.93s -> 3475.29s]  I was like, okay, it's like a comedy thing. When you publicize their car, they like shit their
[3475.29s -> 3482.17s]  pants. I don't know. I've never played this one. Can you get in trouble in this game?
[3488.82s -> 3506.34s]  I don't think I can get in trouble. All right, I made it. Go to the plastic surgeon.
[3506.34s -> 3510.23s]  All right, we have to get through this tutorial first. Purchase weapon upgrade.
[3510.79s -> 3527.94s]  Car crash is funny. That, I guess I'll have to buy the upgrade, right? Okay. Level one. Purchase a
[3527.94s -> 3535.78s]  weapon upgrade. Is there a way to do that? Buy upgrade weapons. This one. Level two.
[3537.06s -> 3550.55s]  I have a hundred dollars. What? Oh, okay. All right, go to the guard armory.
[3554.02s -> 3571.06s]  Where's the car? Holy shit. What's sprint? There's money all over the ground. R3 for melee.
[3571.46s -> 3579.53s]  Like some hellish children's book, the sky has fallen in Steelport.
[3580.09s -> 3586.09s]  10 people are dead after several cars are running out of the sky, crushing an apartment building in
[3586.09s -> 3593.61s]  a fiery blaze. Dozens of bodies, along with a number of crates of vehicles, filled the streets nearby.
[3597.21s -> 3611.78s]  Family guy. Car stereos and sex dolls seems to be... Wait, is that it? I don't have any money.
[3614.66s -> 3626.57s]  What's on fire? What? That's our car? Is she dead? No, you're fine. I can't lose on the tutorial.
[3626.57s -> 3635.34s]  We're good. All right, follow me. I didn't want to. I didn't want to do that. I thought I was.
[3635.34s -> 3647.82s]  Whatever. I'm trying to. How do you sprint? Oh my fucking God. Now what? Left bumper? All right.
[3647.82s -> 3658.68s]  Do I have enough to change the voice? All right. Change voice. Oh, come on, dude. Really? All right.
[3658.76s -> 3685.54s]  I know what it looks like now, though. Get off. All right. Get on. Let's move.
[3686.58s -> 3689.38s]  How come I can't hear any acceleration sounds? That's what's weird to me.
[3690.10s -> 3704.98s]  There's no... We're just floating. It's an electric motor. You're so slow. What?
[3706.22s -> 3710.94s]  I'm not looking over here anymore because I just drive into shit. Stop. Let me do what I'm going to
[3710.94s -> 3736.55s]  do. Okay. Let's go. Don't worry. Pierce has that covered. Kill the guards. Go.
[3746.31s -> 3759.26s]  Get better aim. Can I fight? I need to... All right. Just get off. I got it. Red barrel. Got it.
[3759.34s -> 3794.62s]  I shot up a hundred times. Oh my God. This gun sucks. This gun sucks. Excuse me? All right.
[3796.17s -> 3821.27s]  Weapons. This gun is awful. This one's not. I'm sorry. I'm keyboard turning right now. I'm sorry.
[3821.27s -> 3835.67s]  Holy shit. That was cool. The McShitter.
[3835.91s -> 3843.90s]  UAV drone controls over here. It's making me... Is it anybody else getting angry?
[3849.14s -> 3859.56s]  It's kind of angering, isn't it? Oh my God. There's so many people. What? Do I have a grenade
[3859.56s -> 3872.33s]  or anything? This is too many people here. Oh my God. There's way too many people.
[3884.78s -> 3892.89s]  What the fuck? Help. Help. Help. I need to get up. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help.
[3892.89s -> 3906.14s]  I'm down. Use the what? Dude, I can't even... No. Half the sound effects are missing.
[3908.39s -> 3922.49s]  All right. Where's this thing you're talking about? Did you pirate the game?
[3922.49s -> 3929.94s]  No. I didn't pirate the goddamn game. Do I just have to hold position?
[3941.98s -> 3945.98s]  Something's missing. It's weird. Something is missing from the fucking game.
[3950.31s -> 3964.23s]  I'm getting pissed. Oh my fucking God. Why are there a million people in here?
[3965.82s -> 3968.86s]  There's no music and I feel like half the sound effects don't work.
[3969.58s -> 4007.27s]  Buy the remaster. Somebody say the remaster sucks. See, yeah, this wasn't here before.
[4018.84s -> 4025.27s]  Pull it up. Oh, fuck. It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
[4034.50s -> 4053.05s]  Oh my fucking God. Holy shit, man. What the fuck is this game?
[4077.11s -> 4081.50s]  How many people are here? There's too many people here. I just have seen that.
[4081.50s -> 4112.18s]  Way too many people here witnessed that. I'm trying to kill the helicopters. Nice. Got him.
[4128.57s -> 4150.63s]  Not dead. He'll be in a minute. This dude's doing CBD injections anymore. All right. Let's go. Let's
[4150.63s -> 4189.21s]  go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. This dude's fucking scrunked. There's way too many helicopters flying
[4189.21s -> 4204.62s]  too close. I just moaned. I could feel it. I actually, I know I just moaned. I know I did.
[4204.62s -> 4241.06s]  I did. How many helicopters do we have to shoot at? There's been more helicopters than people.
[4241.54s -> 4277.32s]  All right, let's go. Just go play iPad games instead. Dude, you're having the nightmare
[4277.32s -> 4284.90s]  stream where you expose yourself. We're like, stand up and this is naked. This is shit. This
[4284.90s -> 4290.14s]  is how it started. Let us take care of business. I'm doing this for Johnny.
[4290.38s -> 4299.54s]  You're worried about real estate? We have guns. Let's use them.
[4306.66s -> 4321.53s]  All right. I got money. Who is he talking to? I'm streaming. I need to quit the game and then
[4321.53s -> 4331.19s]  disable and enable v-sync in the Nvidia control panel. Stand up. No, I can't. I can't. I can't. I
[4331.83s -> 4341.50s]  can't do it. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't do it because everyone knows me from here up
[4341.50s -> 4346.18s]  and I look professional. I look like I'm well done. I look well made. All right.
[4346.90s -> 4362.22s]  When I stand up, that illusion goes away because I'm wearing, because I'm wearing the fucking
[4362.22s -> 4368.71s]  goddamn, I'm wearing the fucking Super Mario pajama pants again. All right.
[4369.27s -> 4389.66s]  Is that what you wanted to see? Oh no, it happened. Oh no, it happened.
[4395.27s -> 4397.99s]  I have a new chair though. This thing's fucking really good.
[4403.56s -> 4407.53s]  This is a Herman Miller chair. They actually, they sent it to me.
[4409.10s -> 4416.28s]  Oh my God. My whole fucking life is changing. How many unlockables did I get?
[4419.10s -> 4432.86s]  What? This TF2 stuff in this game? Yeah. There's like 10 different adjustable knobs on this thing.
[4434.70s -> 4440.70s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay.
[4440.70s -> 4461.98s]  Hey. Okay. Enough slices. Don't yell. I'm sorry. All right. Let's go.
[4467.67s -> 4495.18s]  All right. Weird science. He's got a pirated copy. That's all DLC. Oh, did I buy the DLC pack?
[4495.18s -> 4507.77s]  All right. Let's go. Game is now open. Really? Is there a casino in this game?
[4507.77s -> 4517.29s]  All right. Where do I want to go? Where was that? That there it is. It's so far away.
[4517.29s -> 4526.62s]  Do these exist in all the little sections of the city? There's probably another one over here,
[4526.62s -> 4542.52s]  right? Unknown. Which one is it? Those that are played this game a lot because these are all
[4542.52s -> 4561.40s]  unknown. Bottom one, like right here. I'll check this one. That one. Go to the strip club.
[4562.04s -> 4582.07s]  Why would you do that? All right. That's a gun place. Is it this one? Check this one too.
[4582.87s -> 4592.84s]  The top center. I thought you guys said it was the bottom one.
[4602.95s -> 4608.26s]  Nope. Car place. Whatever. I'm sure I'll get up there eventually.
[4614.15s -> 4616.55s]  Go to the strip club and turn on face cam.
[4616.95s -> 4622.15s]  With your steel board breaking news. What? That's basically why would it mean to turn on the face
[4622.15s -> 4644.74s]  cam? Stronger. You said you needed me. All right. So what's this one? Do the ipads for the ipads
[4644.74s -> 4659.45s]  room is going to take a while to set up. I got to get like 50 games. This is DLC. Oh, only do face cam.
[4659.45s -> 4676.25s]  I see they failed you Johnny. Never will. Number one fan for months. I've been cut sunglasses.
[4680.90s -> 4685.10s]  I thought I had had enough things that he touched.
[4687.58s -> 4711.22s]  He's trying to make a clone. You cloned Gat? Yeah. That just took me by surprise. I forgot
[4711.22s -> 4714.42s]  that was a person in the game. I was like, who the fuck is that guy?
[4750.98s -> 4767.80s]  Okay. Robot chicken. Do I have enough firepower to do this? Hey, hey, hey.
[4768.76s -> 4773.24s]  Hey, slow down. Yeah, but you knew we had to take on the center.
[4773.24s -> 4780.04s]  A clone of Gat ain't gonna know that. Is it like a giant version of? Okay.
[4788.89s -> 4792.41s]  Change the voice? I mean, I'm so far away from it.
[4797.88s -> 4802.82s]  Okay. The next time I come across one, I will change it. I promise.
[4803.78s -> 4832.06s]  Do you look crusty today? I'd rather be fucking crusty than soggy and like wilted.
[4846.58s -> 4869.16s]  All right. So where is he? Oh, he's narrating this whole thing.
[4871.06s -> 4879.86s]  Interrogate. Oh, get in. All right. Come here. How do I interrogate?
[4880.42s -> 4890.63s]  What the hell do you want? Is your favorite food chicken? Oh, that's one of them.
[4895.85s -> 4899.37s]  Better find Gat before these guys do. I was like, why did my voice change?
[4903.82s -> 4907.30s]  I thought that was me talking. Okay.
[4930.31s -> 4938.70s]  Why am I still holding this person? Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[4940.94s -> 4968.23s]  All right, let's go. I feel like I'm watching someone else watch someone play this game.
[4969.19s -> 4973.35s]  Why? This is like a weird feeling I'm having. I feel like I'm not playing. I'm like watching
[4973.35s -> 4980.12s]  someone else play. Does that make any sense? I don't know what it is with this game.
[4980.12s -> 4985.82s]  Why Saints Row 3? I didn't feel that way in Saints Row 2. I think I'm watching someone play the game.
[4985.82s -> 5003.16s]  Oh, no. I'm just saying it's like, I feel like I haven't played the game yet. Does that make
[5003.16s -> 5031.45s]  any sense? It's probably the camera. It's not the camera shake. I can't lose. All right. Where is he?
[5036.73s -> 5040.33s]  Screaming his name and something about stripper poles and then started
[5040.33s -> 5052.04s]  trashing the place. People panicked and he ran off. Okay. Why don't, what are you, what?
[5052.04s -> 5059.08s]  We were not supposed to kill him. All right. What is going on here? Get the fuck away from me.
[5059.08s -> 5075.37s]  Get this guy. I thought we were supposed to kill this guy. I didn't do that. Okay.
[5075.37s -> 5110.38s]  Okay. Grenade. Grenade out. Oh, be careful. I love the crow hop. This is DLC.
[5123.38s -> 5134.07s]  Okay. Somebody said, dude, I wish somebody in chat would let me know if this was DLC or not.
[5134.07s -> 5165.34s]  Okay. Where's Jimmy? All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's get out. Out, out, out. Turn around,
[5165.34s -> 5189.88s]  turn around. Get behind me. Shoot, shoot. All right. Let's go.
[5205.03s -> 5218.07s]  What the fuck are you doing? Hey, dude. Come on, man. When the fucking Uber pulls up,
[5218.07s -> 5222.87s]  you don't, come on. Don't, don't, now don't text me and say, hey, where are you, man? I'm looking
[5222.95s -> 5228.23s]  for you. You drove right by me. I have the GPS thing right there. I'm not, I don't want to walk
[5228.23s -> 5242.54s]  a half mile to go find you now. Oh, this is a rocket launcher. All right. What is this person
[5242.54s -> 5260.47s]  doing? I don't have to even shoot at them. They're just going to, what is it? Is it a monster?
[5261.35s -> 5281.14s]  What the fuck was that? I thought he was going to be way bigger. Is it weird that I'm not intimidated
[5281.14s -> 5295.67s]  at all? I thought he was going to be five times bigger. Protect the car. All right.
[5296.23s -> 5370.31s]  Discovering shortcuts, update your GPS. Okay. Oh, stop, stop. What, what, what? There's too many
[5370.31s -> 5393.37s]  rockets. This game feels like a fever dream. I'll tell you, I feel like I haven't played the game.
[5394.09s -> 5410.38s]  Am I out of ammo? No. I feel like somebody is describing Saints Row 3 to me right now.
[5411.02s -> 5415.66s]  And I'm like imagining what you're describing. Like I'm sitting there listening to you be like,
[5415.66s -> 5418.78s]  yeah, man, so we're in the car. Uh, one of the missions you drive around and shoot the rocket
[5418.78s -> 5421.58s]  launcher and stuff. It's fucking Saints Row. And I'm just sitting there going, okay, I'm picturing
[5421.58s -> 5454.66s]  that what that is. Don't play the deal. Well, this was in the beginning of the game too. I feel like
[5454.66s -> 5468.86s]  I've been hanging out of a window for an hour, an hour and 20 minutes. Oh, this car is going to
[5468.86s -> 5484.92s]  explode. There's so many things. What the fuck is happening, man? No, no, this is the real long play
[5484.92s -> 5488.52s]  that the world is doing to me right now. See, I'm going to wake up. I'm going to wake up and I'm
[5488.52s -> 5490.60s]  going to be in the chair and I'm going to have the controller in my hand. I'm going to be playing
[5490.60s -> 5494.76s]  Saints Row 3. Be like, oh shit. Oh my God. Okay. No, I was, I was sleeping. I was asleep. I was
[5494.76s -> 5499.66s]  weird. What a weird dream. I'm going to look down and then my dick is going to be out. I'm going to
[5499.66s -> 5504.28s]  be like, what the fuck? No, no, no, no, no, this can't be real. And I'm going to look over a chat
[5504.28s -> 5511.96s]  and everyone's going to be screaming that I did it. This was the long dream. This was the long con
[5511.96s -> 5533.10s]  that my dream was pulling. Do you imagine me just sitting here sleeping? I'm just sitting here like,
[5535.29s -> 5541.48s]  but that means I would have had to have turned the stream on, right? Wait, did I not? What about the,
[5542.36s -> 5564.15s]  I got a lot of money. Okay. I got money. Let's get health regen. Let's do abilities,
[5565.88s -> 5578.70s]  do welding, notoriety. I like that. We'll do sprint. These all cost money. Okay. Hold on.
[5578.70s -> 5593.88s]  I got two grand. Okay. So missions. So this, so this is DLC, right? So which one of these is just
[5593.88s -> 5609.02s]  story mission? Go to your weapons and outfits. This is like a garage. Okay. So it's all DLC.
[5609.02s -> 5623.62s]  All right. So, so I just want to do like the next mission. Okay. Wardrobe. Oh my God.
[5624.26s -> 5658.41s]  It'll be Darth Vader. Oh my God. I, this one's great. I'll put the heavy mask on only for a
[5658.41s -> 5706.86s]  little bit though. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Do I get cars? What the hell? What? I just
[5706.86s -> 5722.12s]  get this at the beginning. Oh my God. Really? All right. Well, I want this thing. Chainstay. All
[5722.12s -> 5730.87s]  right. So now let's go. I look like one of the worms from like Worms Armageddon. Gang operations.
[5734.30s -> 5760.39s]  Oh shit. Do I have a grenade? This is the fucking dickhead that just sits over here that you find
[5760.39s -> 5767.26s]  in the online game and he's dressed like this. He has like $500 worth of in-game currency
[5767.90s -> 5786.47s]  and you can't even hurt this guy. Oh shit. Somebody got to him. GTA hacker.
[5789.02s -> 5793.58s]  You know, like a UFO is just going to spawn up there. What? I just got on it.
[5800.50s -> 5806.60s]  What the hell is going on? Um, okay. Why is this fucking Fortnite? What's going on here?
[5806.60s -> 5820.55s]  Fuck is going on? What? Why does this person have this ultra move? You got to keep up grandpa.
[5823.18s -> 5833.14s]  Now this is, this is where this guy goes. Fucking goddamn online store. 500 gems. 29.99. Checkout.
[5833.22s -> 5842.01s]  Checkout. Password. Accepted. Thank you. Your purchase is complete. Ammo. Guns. Rocket launcher.
[5842.01s -> 5876.36s]  Full ammo. All right. I want to, let's, let's do something. That's John from Delocated. That's
[5876.36s -> 5888.63s]  John from Delocated. It really is. That's what that was. That was, that was a blast from the past.
[5888.63s -> 5895.86s]  Holy shit. All right. So where do I go? What should I do? Should I pick up one of these missions?
[5895.86s -> 5910.62s]  How about, uh, all of these DLC? The top is the mission. Okay. Let's do this one. Your character
[5910.62s -> 5922.57s]  is looking thick. Why is the helmet coming off? Why was that so brutal for that one guy?
[5926.66s -> 5927.62s]  That was unnecessary.
[5934.71s -> 5946.04s]  I know about the, I know I got to change the voice. Okay. Look, it's taking me over here.
[5946.04s -> 5955.94s]  Is there one on the way? Is this one? Is this it right here? Or is there one closer? I don't think
[5955.94s -> 5971.67s]  there's one closer. Let's go to this one. I feel like it's probably this one. Let's move. I was
[5971.67s -> 5979.54s]  not gonna, I was just not gonna stop. I don't, I didn't care. I was not stopping. Holding the brake
[5979.54s -> 5995.85s]  was going to be too hard. Too much shit. It was, I was too lazy to. All right. So what is, what's up?
[5996.41s -> 6023.91s]  This is not, this is not one either. Really? Come on. This one, just go west. I mean, this is the
[6023.91s -> 6032.17s]  only one I haven't seen. I'll try this one. This one's close. I need a new car though. This thing's
[6032.17s -> 6066.46s]  annoying. Watch out. What's the horn? Sprint and steal to get in faster. Oh, that's true.
[6066.46s -> 6073.56s]  You're right. Does this say anything? All right. I'm getting, everyone's, I'm just getting lied to
[6073.56s -> 6087.10s]  over and over again. I just, I'm just going to go to the mission. Everyone said that one, that one,
[6087.10s -> 6090.38s]  that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one. That's probably like two in
[6090.38s -> 6132.46s]  the whole map. What a smooth ride. I found one. I didn't want to shoot the gun. I wanted to punch
[6132.46s -> 6182.28s]  him. Okay. Voice. Here we go. Yes. We're doing one. Okay. Now everybody will be happy. Why not
[6182.28s -> 6185.96s]  three? Cause three is the McGriddler. That's not, I'm not the McGriddler right now. I'm with resin
[6185.96s -> 6202.74s]  pour. Somebody give me a car. Okay. Thank you. That'd be so fucked up. Do you imagine seeing
[6202.74s -> 6223.08s]  that? If you watch that happen, it's like, Hey, why? Whoa. That is gone already. All right. Let's
[6223.08s -> 6232.22s]  do it. Mission time. Oh, right. The title says McGriddler. It's not even accurate. Let's go to
[6232.22s -> 6253.21s]  tune it. Let's find a real asshole. All right. We're going to get this tuned up. Shani's taking
[6253.21s -> 6258.79s]  this thing. We can't stop. Don't cut me off. We all are, but you're always pissed off. The girl's
[6258.79s -> 6270.98s]  not as crazy as you. Don't worry. Keep an eye on it. Long time. He was there when I first joined
[6270.98s -> 6277.22s]  the saints. He click baited us. He mellowed with age. Somebody called it too. You really did.
[6277.22s -> 6281.62s]  Somebody in prestream said he's going to get to the character creator. Something's going to make
[6281.62s -> 6285.86s]  him laugh and he's going to change everything. And I said, no way that happens. You were right.
[6285.86s -> 6305.11s]  You were completely right. Yeah. Yeah. You actually got it. Correct. Minecraft David.
[6306.86s -> 6311.98s]  That was a good idea, but that was too funny. Come on. Like the guy lies on a lying on the
[6311.98s -> 6319.35s]  table on a wooden table. Resin guy joke. I had to do it. I had to. I had to. I don't want to
[6319.35s -> 6329.54s]  level up this car. This guy sucks. That's all I'm doing. Got some more style. Now it's our turn.
[6329.54s -> 6333.22s]  Hey, the planet saints. I don't know, man. That's like wearing the band's t-shirt to the concert.
[6333.22s -> 6336.31s]  Nothing wrong with wanting to look. I always look good.
[6338.66s -> 6358.66s]  Okay. Go to planet. Planet saints. Turn cruise control off to hear the engine. To the streets.
[6359.46s -> 6366.18s]  Got me up the cigarette. Is that zip? She's on my feet. To find a reason.
[6366.98s -> 6373.94s]  Reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone. Oh,
[6373.94s -> 6383.69s]  no. I could still get high and I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.
[6387.14s -> 6393.53s]  Yeah. I like this game. You didn't shut up. I do it because I'm the one that can sing in this group.
[6394.25s -> 6399.45s]  Life is what you got. Well, you might get run over or you might get shot.
[6401.53s -> 6420.44s]  Everyone stop doing this. I'm the singer of the group. That's what I got.
[6424.23s -> 6437.00s]  Oh shit. You hit a lady. You hit a lady. You hit a lady. Holy fuck. Oppress that person.
[6437.00s -> 6447.18s]  Get that person. He needs to be under arrest. All right. Let's go. What's happening? What am I
[6447.18s -> 6482.01s]  doing right now? No. Wait. Give me the engineer head. What's the other? What's the color? What's
[6482.01s -> 6499.98s]  the colors for the engineer? It's that. It's brown, right? Yeah. That was correct. Okay. Good. Yep.
[6499.98s -> 6536.15s]  And then we need the engineer head. A light. All right. What about gloves? He's got gloves,
[6536.15s -> 6547.77s]  right? They're the big bright yellow, right? Yeah. They're huge. Here we go. I don't even need to
[6547.77s -> 6559.40s]  change color. They are. No, they're not quite yellow. They're there. That's a pretty, that's
[6559.40s -> 6580.86s]  pretty close. This is bad. This is good enough. Who the fuck is this? Is that thing something
[6581.42s -> 6592.12s]  pissed off? Okay. I'm an engineer, but that means I solve problems. I solve practical problems
[6593.00s -> 6603.74s]  like this. I'm doing my routine. Stop. If that don't work, use a gun. If that don't work,
[6605.82s -> 6634.20s]  use more guns. Did I win? I got it. I want to queue up. Why am I shooting at these people?
[6634.20s -> 6643.40s]  I want to queue up the TF2 theme song, but alt tabbing this game will break it.
[6653.27s -> 6674.76s]  Are these people? This is wrong. I don't know what's happening. Hey, look, bud.
[6680.09s -> 6682.95s]  I'm going to do it because why the fuck not? I'm having fun today.
[6686.14s -> 6687.50s]  We're just having fun today, you know?
[6687.50s -> 6752.63s]  Oh shit. Get him. I'm an engineer. Was that me? Where's the safe house?
[6759.21s -> 6762.57s]  No, no, no. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it
[6762.57s -> 6793.11s]  down. Put it down. This is a 2013 video you made. True. True. Where's the fucking safe house?
[6793.99s -> 6803.53s]  What? Abandoning who? Where is he?
[6836.86s -> 6847.06s]  Save your game. Oh my God. You're right. What am I? Clothes change. Oh, nope. That's my friend.
[6847.78s -> 6863.75s]  Throwing grenades. Get in the safe house. I don't need to kill everybody. Get in the safe house,
[6863.75s -> 6892.78s]  please. All right. We're safe. Get in here. I'm in the safe house, right? Oh, there we go.
[6892.78s -> 6914.33s]  What about autoplay? It's not a six grand. I'll take it. Hey, look, bud. Okay. Well, if we're
[6914.33s -> 6918.78s]  going to do this joke, we need to do it with other characters too, because that's what I want to do
[6918.78s -> 6948.65s]  today. So that's what we're doing. That's just what's happening. So close, right? How do I change
[6948.65s -> 6961.00s]  the color? He has underwear with a big dick. All right. I gotta go back to the store.
[6961.64s -> 6994.46s]  New missions available. Cool. Party time. I need to put that backpack on too. Save the game. Yep.
[6994.46s -> 7006.73s]  Yep. Mission checkpoints are not saved. That doesn't matter. Okay. We're good. Okay. Let's go to
[7009.34s -> 7015.67s]  tattoo parlor. Yeah. I need to buy that backpack. All right. There's probably a closed store
[7015.99s -> 7019.82s]  where I'm going, right? There is. There's one on the way. We'll go to this one here.
[7019.82s -> 7028.10s]  And the real estate agent will be there, right? Real funny. Oh, that's a nice car.
[7030.25s -> 7036.97s]  It's not the one I wanted, but whatever. What's the plan? I want, I want the car in front of me.
[7036.97s -> 7049.85s]  The nice one, the one, whatever. Now I'm not going to get it. Right. Pen houses. Psychos. Yeah. I'll
[7049.85s -> 7069.40s]  take this one. What's wrong with this car? What's wrong with this car? The tires look fine. There's
[7069.40s -> 7094.20s]  no body damage. What's the problem? I'm not breaking there. We're good. Stop using both feet.
[7095.40s -> 7101.93s]  Like I'm pressing down both feet onto the, yeah, it's turbo power. That's how you go faster. You
[7101.93s -> 7154.02s]  can double the gas. I need to, this is going to kill me. Okay. We're good. Sorry. Okay. I need to
[7154.02s -> 7170.14s]  change the colors on this to red and white outfits. Okay. Here we go. What color was this? It was
[7170.14s -> 7179.62s]  not this color, but red. If I'm on red team, it was always gray. That's right. It was gray.
[7187.74s -> 7232.92s]  That's fine. Okay. Upper body. Where's the thing I'm currently wearing outfits. It's coming up here.
[7232.92s -> 7254.12s]  Right. Where is it? No, it's the thing I have on right now. What's it called? Now there it is. I
[7254.12s -> 7265.08s]  don't want the witch hat though. How do I change the colors? How do I change colors? I don't want
[7265.08s -> 7281.98s]  the hat. Okay. So it's what? Whoa. Yeah. It's white and red. We'll have this just blend in
[7283.24s -> 7305.34s]  and then red gloves. Okay. Yeah. Big red gloves. They're huge. What's the biggest ones they got?
[7305.34s -> 7323.14s]  These are pretty big. Okay. And then his pants, uh, they're kind of maroon. It's kind of like this.
[7323.14s -> 7334.62s]  They're like slacks. Yeah. They're like, kind of like this. It's like a dark, like a brown.
[7334.62s -> 7354.65s]  It's like just kind of brownish. That's close enough. Okay. What about the shoes? Boots?
[7354.65s -> 7377.16s]  They're just black boots. But everything's fine. They're, they're not, they're kind of,
[7377.16s -> 7389.67s]  I'll just make them. It's all right. It's making black. All right. Here we go. I made the medic.
[7389.67s -> 7424.38s]  I'm good to go. Hey, there we are. Medic. I thought the game just crashed. Holy shit. Why is
[7424.38s -> 7436.92s]  that person on the ground? Emerald skin. All right. Let's do the mission and I will put on.
[7437.00s -> 7449.99s]  Yes. Well, this is what's keeping us active today. So I put on voice lines to just put on the
[7450.55s -> 7457.14s]  sound effects. Okay. I'm going to put on, I'm going to drop all the sound effects in the game,
[7458.01s -> 7462.89s]  every sound effect in this game. And I'm going to put on like gameplay, no commentary, an hour on
[7462.89s -> 7467.86s]  dust bowl, put that on in the background, put the music in the background, and then put a bunch of
[7467.86s -> 7476.06s]  medic, uh, voice lines. I've just been to play. I think that's what I want to do. Do you remember
[7476.06s -> 7488.17s]  why? How come you're not eating pirate's booty on stream? Why would I be doing that? The mods
[7488.17s -> 7498.41s]  are just on top of it. This is great. All right. I, I'm going to tell you, this is my first,
[7498.41s -> 7509.26s]  this is my first day sitting in this new chair. This is way better than the thing I had before.
[7511.94s -> 7522.92s]  All right. So this, so this chair, you can turn a knob and it like, it pushes the kind of spine
[7522.92s -> 7531.78s]  support thing into your back. It just like kind of wedges you in. Yeah. It's Herman Miller. I'm not
[7531.86s -> 7537.85s]  sponsoring anything. They, I just was in the market for a new chair. And I mean, I guess you
[7537.85s -> 7543.85s]  could say this is, I mean, if you want to call it a sponsorship, it wasn't paid to say anything
[7543.85s -> 7557.10s]  about it, but I think I got a chair. So that's fucking cool. So yeah, this was, this chair was
[7557.10s -> 7562.54s]  provided to me by Herman Miller. If you want me to say that, right. That's kind of what I should be
[7562.54s -> 7576.47s]  saying, but it's fucking awesome. They are expensive, but I mean,
[7581.35s -> 7593.10s]  you should review cigarettes. They are very, very expensive. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[7593.10s -> 7600.14s]  no. We're not doing that song. I don't know. We're doing the TF tooth joke. Will that work
[7600.14s -> 7616.17s]  here? This is going to fall so flat, I think, but whatever. How flat do you think this is going to
[7616.17s -> 7626.87s]  be? Let's find out. Okay. Red medic dust ball gameplay. No commentary. Medic voice lines.
[7626.87s -> 7642.71s]  That's just everything here. Let's get it ready. How's that? This is fucking stupid.
[7662.82s -> 7663.70s]  Please.
[7738.47s -> 7745.93s]  He keeps talking. What? It's a spy.
[7746.49s -> 7771.02s]  Everyone's a spy.
[7833.08s -> 7861.53s]  Okay, I can't fucking do it anymore. It's too much.
[7864.49s -> 7873.53s]  Oh, okay.
[7883.45s -> 7889.05s]  That's enough. I think my chest hurts. When he's talking about his head,
[7889.85s -> 7893.21s]  push, help me push the point. Oh my God. That's so fucking funny.
[7894.95s -> 7904.18s]  Okay. Well, let's get back to this. Yeah. I know can't for that one that the,
[7904.18s -> 7924.92s]  I think the bit needs to play out my head, my head. Okay. This is okay. Now this is like,
[7924.92s -> 7936.63s]  this is like strange to me now. This is, isn't this a weird now? I feel like I did. I did. I
[7936.63s -> 7968.49s]  put on another song. Whatever. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go. Quick.
[7977.10s -> 7986.10s]  What am I doing? What the fuck did I do that for? I don't know why I did that. I started
[7986.10s -> 7998.30s]  coughing and just did it. My head, my head. Okay. We're good. Back to it.
[8006.54s -> 8015.98s]  We need to start Dustbowl again. What a fucking amazing game. It's so good. It's so good.
[8016.70s -> 8021.18s]  Right? You know what I mean? They'll never be another team fortress ever. It's impossible.
[8021.18s -> 8025.58s]  You know what I think? Here, I can give you a take here. Everybody that thinks that the,
[8025.58s -> 8029.26s]  oh my God, half-life, half-life, half-life, half-life, half-life. It's going to be so hard
[8029.26s -> 8034.78s]  to make another half-life. No, no, absolutely. Team Fortress 2, they'll like, they'll be,
[8034.78s -> 8040.54s]  never be another TF2. It'll be impossible to make TF3. I feel strongly about that versus
[8040.54s -> 8045.58s]  Half-Life 3. I think they could do a Half-Life 3 and be fine. I don't think they could do a TF3.
[8046.70s -> 8059.21s]  That game was perfect. It was perfect. It was a perfect video game. So now I'm more afraid about
[8059.21s -> 8066.33s]  them trying to do TF3 if they ever decide to, right? I mean, what is going on right now?
[8066.97s -> 8078.41s]  There's a bass high take. There's the characters, the voice work. It was like this whole world that
[8078.41s -> 8082.73s]  they created and they didn't have to do anything. You know what the craziest part about TF2 really
[8082.73s -> 8089.96s]  was? There was this overarching kind of storyline, right? But it really lived in the background
[8091.16s -> 8097.64s]  and the characters made everything. The characterization of the classes made the,
[8097.72s -> 8103.88s]  you kind of got to, hold on, sorry. I'm like, I hear like music. It's like the characters were
[8103.88s -> 8109.48s]  the whole thing. You didn't even need a story. And there was just enough overarching stuff in
[8109.48s -> 8117.61s]  the background that made it perfect. If I could, okay, okay. I got three wishes. If a Genie came
[8117.61s -> 8122.89s]  in front of me and was like, hello, Charma. Good to see you. I'm the Genie and you have three wishes.
[8123.53s -> 8128.65s]  I would, okay, here's what I'd wish for. I'd wish for like literally world peace and world hunger.
[8129.77s -> 8134.25s]  And make Team Fortress 3 as good as TF2. There you go. Those are my three wishes.
[8134.25s -> 8135.77s]  And by the way, release it in like six months.
[8158.44s -> 8167.29s]  What the fuck? Where are they? I didn't, look, I'm sorry.
[8180.98s -> 8211.69s]  You should wish for more stuff. You can't wish for more wishes. Let's go. Follow what? Did I fail?
[8212.81s -> 8216.49s]  No, okay, we're good. I failed? What happened? What the fuck just happened?
[8219.14s -> 8237.85s]  What? Oh my God. I can't do a cool action jump. It hurts so bad. All right, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[8237.85s -> 8272.65s]  go. Am I calling somebody? Crash your helicopter into him. I thought about it,
[8272.65s -> 8300.34s]  but I don't think I can reach him. Oh shit. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I don't care.
[8301.48s -> 8309.51s]  I don't care. I don't care. Whatever. Everyone's yelling at me. God, yell at me. I don't care.
[8309.51s -> 8318.92s]  I don't care. It's fine. I don't care. No, I don't care. I don't care. People are like,
[8318.92s -> 8338.62s]  oh my God, he must care. I don't care at all. I don't care. Go. All right. Don't be an idiot.
[8339.34s -> 8346.57s]  I'm just a full throttle. Okay. Now I feel like I'm playing the game, right? Like the last 45
[8346.57s -> 8426.12s]  minutes. What are you talking about? I didn't care. Whoa. Shooting shit at me. Okay. So let's go.
[8430.74s -> 8474.39s]  He crashed. What? Do I have to land? I'm okay. Come here. Red wire. Whoa. Somebody's phone's
[8474.39s -> 8489.99s]  ringing. Let's fire the gun. Did I lose? Oh, not again. The saints aren't going to back down.
[8491.03s -> 8496.55s]  Maddie, there's nothing to worry about. My thoughts exactly, Mr. Kilbane. The saints
[8496.55s -> 8512.01s]  are no more than a white noise of empty sights. With respect, sir, I'd say empty is no longer
[8512.01s -> 8524.79s]  applicable. I forgot that it's in the cut scenes. I completely glazed over that.
[8526.60s -> 8555.66s]  Max a fucking psycho. Sound of progress, my friend. Oh, I own this place now. Okay.
[8556.22s -> 8569.74s]  A stun gun. Can we, wait a minute. What the saints wear, what vehicles they drive and their taunts.
[8571.66s -> 8579.93s]  Are you telling me that I can make a full Team Fortress 2 gang? Do you not even talk? Please
[8579.93s -> 8582.97s]  don't tell me that because that's all I care about for the rest of the whole day.
[8583.61s -> 8607.75s]  Well, how do I do that? Where do I do that? It's only pre-made costumes? Oh, okay. All right.
[8607.75s -> 8635.38s]  Access the crib. Let's find out. Wardrobe. Okay. Gang. Style. Okay. Oh, no, you can't.
[8638.18s -> 8649.58s]  No, it's all right. You can't. Oh, well. Oh, well. Oh, well. Okay. It's all right.
[8651.02s -> 8657.74s]  I mean, everyone's going to get the dumper though. That's very important. What about their car?
[8662.98s -> 8685.66s]  Yep. Yep. Yeah. Maybe I should upgrade some guns. All right. Damage. Bullet damage. I mean,
[8685.66s -> 8692.07s]  why not? 5% reduction in damage taken from bullets. 10% reduction in damage when hit by a vehicle.
[8693.11s -> 8707.08s]  I got 14 grand. Oh, explosive ammo. Carried 25% more grenades. Yeah. More pistol ammo. More
[8707.08s -> 8718.18s]  shotgun. More SMG. Mailing enemies throws them slightly further. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Don't spend
[8718.18s -> 8730.12s]  all my money. Bonuses. Hourly city income. 500 bucks. Yeah, I'll take it. Pay cash for 4,000
[8730.12s -> 8744.41s]  respect. Okay. Gang abilities. Vehicle delivery. Yep. I like that. You should do mods. Maybe I'll
[8744.41s -> 8751.94s]  do like an insane mod day. You know, yeah, let's write that down. I'm going to do just a wacky mod
[8751.94s -> 8758.50s]  day where I pick up a few games that have just never ending mods and just ruin them and play
[8758.50s -> 8764.50s]  like three or four games. Because, okay, here's the problem. Once you start turning on mods that
[8764.50s -> 8769.30s]  are crazy, you're not the games over. You're not playing the game anymore. There's no going back
[8769.30s -> 8772.50s]  to like, oh, I'm going to use the pistol and go to do the mission. It's not going to happen anymore.
[8773.32s -> 8776.76s]  So you got to give yourself like an hour or two to play in the mod playground and then move on.
[8779.80s -> 8791.27s]  So that we'll do it. We'll do a we'll do a cookie mod night. We'll do it soon. Can I parachute off
[8791.27s -> 8814.81s]  this? All right. That's pretty cool. Answer cell phone. You're attacking our grip. All right. You
[8814.81s -> 8834.22s]  got it. I'm on my way. I didn't even see that. Wait, they're up here. Recreational drugs and
[8834.22s -> 8841.42s]  numerous hookers. Now gunfights can be added to that list. Shots were fired in a downtown penthouse
[8841.42s -> 8851.26s]  apartment resulting in several deaths. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh my God. Give me the car.
[8856.06s -> 8898.94s]  Did you actually get in the car? What's up? Put her down. Put her down. Put her down. Put her down.
[8898.94s -> 8911.00s]  Put her down. Get out. Get out. What are you doing? What are you doing? Why?
[8911.16s -> 8958.25s]  Why? Oh shit. Go. All right. I did the mission, right? We're good. All right. Cool. New mission.
[8958.25s -> 8962.74s]  What am I going to do? What am I going to do next? Guardian angel. Let's do this one.
[8962.74s -> 8970.20s]  Let's go to the HQ. Hey, I think I'm ready to make a move on the syndicate. What you got in mind?
[8970.20s -> 8974.49s]  Get to the crib. You see, this better be worth my time. I said this is boring. I want to watch
[8974.49s -> 8994.47s]  you gamble. Oh, I mean, I know a guy that does a lot of gambling. I've got to know him a little
[8994.47s -> 9026.36s]  bit over the last few years. Yeah. OK, let's do it. Check it out, boss. What's up? Since this
[9026.36s -> 9031.08s]  used to be a syndicate crib, but I poke around and see what they left behind. No one's getting
[9031.08s -> 9038.36s]  any more hints. Now shut up. The syndicate will know we have the keys. They'll be waiting for us
[9038.36s -> 9042.84s]  to make a move. I guess then you better watch my back. All right, let's go.
[9042.84s -> 9051.77s]  Oh, hanging out of the fucking chopper, shooting grenades at people, hanging out of the side of a
[9051.77s -> 9093.74s]  fucking window. Why do I have control for that? Just keeping you on your toes. Stop driving into
[9093.74s -> 9133.06s]  my missiles. I can't even aim that far. I can't aim that far. Air shot. I got it. I actually got
[9133.06s -> 9159.00s]  it. How do I heal your car? Well, drive by them. Your car is fucked up, man. They're blocking the
[9159.00s -> 9187.90s]  road up here. Help me out. Where? Well, I stopped flying the helicopter so far. You idiot. I'm going,
[9187.90s -> 9232.33s]  Mouse, for this. Your sensitivity is so high. You haven't been touched once. Relax. Come on, move.
[9272.46s -> 9298.46s]  Help me out. Stop hiding behind the car. It's just over the bridge. I'll find a place to set up.
[9305.32s -> 9367.82s]  Oh, right in the middle. What? Why would you pull up that close? Oh shit, they got
[9381.62s -> 9422.06s]  this. I think his mate saw me. Yes. Yes, he did. Oh, we're in a Team Fortress 2 movie today, huh?
[9430.87s -> 9449.30s]  Only two grand for that? What the hell? That's kind of bullshit if you ask me. $82 per hour.
[9449.30s -> 9465.10s]  Oh, this is... I don't want to do this again. Jeremy, you're good at sniping? Just wait till you see my raw
[9465.10s -> 9481.16s]  snipes and the fucking misgive $100,000 smite tournament on the 27th. What happened over here?
[9481.16s -> 9511.69s]  What are these people doing? What's wrong with you? Oops. All right, mission. Let's go. This one.
[9527.70s -> 9532.42s]  So you're saying it has to be me. Oh, I'll do the selling. You just get my back and I have the
[9532.42s -> 9539.93s]  perfect places to hit. I thought you weren't going to play smite anymore. I didn't say that.
[9545.56s -> 9555.90s]  I didn't say that. When did I say that? You literally did. What are you talking? So how
[9555.90s -> 9559.58s]  do we know where to sell? Let's cut right to the heart of this shit and hit the Morningstar
[9559.58s -> 9563.42s]  territory. How do you know where that is? The documents we got with those keys gave up a whole
[9563.42s -> 9574.87s]  lot. Smite Thursdays. I like it. What sort of things we have to sell off? I'm driving? No,
[9574.87s -> 9584.47s]  he's driving. So we have a bunch of shit drove into a tree as fast as they could. Why?
[9603.96s -> 9615.82s]  All right, let's get the deal done. Protect the dealer and the buyer. You got it.
[9616.30s -> 9628.68s]  This saint's biography is signed by the whole crew. Give me some pickles and I'll wear anything.
[9631.42s -> 9650.46s]  Protected. Let's go. Shoot this fucking guy, please. All right, let's go. New deal. Yeah.
[9650.46s -> 9665.40s]  Hold the gun to their head. I don't think that'll work. I'm not driving the car. This car has beat
[9665.40s -> 9685.00s]  the fuck up bad. Will you just stop already? Finally. That's another deal. Something wrong
[9685.00s -> 9699.77s]  with your eyes. You get out of the car. Haha. Stupid. Don't fuck with the saints. It just
[9705.03s -> 9711.67s]  in these universes, I would never want to walk anywhere. It's just driving into people like I'm
[9711.67s -> 9723.11s]  not going to. I'm literally not going anywhere. I got to go over there. Oh, he left without paying.
[9723.11s -> 9742.49s]  Did we get him? These people are fucking pissing me off. Did I just make them so angry? Wait,
[9745.05s -> 9786.30s]  you fucking idiot. You're going to drown them? All right, let's go. All right, take their car.
[9786.94s -> 9801.77s]  Haha. Drive. Get us out of here. What are you doing? Where is he going? You're going to get
[9801.77s -> 9833.67s]  into melee range. Where is he going? Oh my goodness. I snapped his neck. This is fucking brutal.
[9835.48s -> 9847.40s]  Can we can we leave? Can we leave? Just get in the car and let's leave. Okay. I pissed these people
[9847.40s -> 9854.50s]  off so bad. They're never going to leave me alone. They're never going to leave me alone.
[9855.22s -> 9890.94s]  Is there a reason why you're going 20? You good? I'm just like, I don't even want to be here.
[9899.21s -> 9914.68s]  Two grand. Let's go. Six respect. Pretty good. Ban the spammers. Ban the spammers. Ban the spammers.
[9914.68s -> 9934.42s]  Ban the spammers. What's next? All right, now let's take over the city. You want to rob some
[9934.42s -> 9942.06s]  store? That'll cause more problems than because they'll jump at the chance to sell to us. Nope,
[9942.06s -> 9950.36s]  because we already have come again. We take the deed from the lock box. They can't argue.
[9955.06s -> 9961.42s]  Call the banners. All right, if I called the banners, would you guys come to my aid? Like,
[9961.42s -> 9967.50s]  if I made a World of Warcraft account, I was like, call the banners. I want gold from everybody.
[9967.82s -> 9983.82s]  Would it work? No. Yeah, it would. Why wouldn't it? I mean, I'm never going to play World of
[9983.82s -> 10018.98s]  Warcraft. Don't worry. Oh my god. This is a nice car. You still did Shadowlands. I literally
[10018.98s -> 10032.46s]  installed it. Played it for like a week and didn't do anything. If it was an FPS game,
[10032.46s -> 10052.47s]  maybe I would. A whole week? What the hell? Why did they have to do that cutscene?
[10052.95s -> 10058.15s]  So, friendly fire? Yep. Best thing is, owning it gives us a discount. It's 100 bucks.
[10060.47s -> 10067.19s]  $500 per hour? That's a huge deal. This city's full of businesses and buildings we can snatch
[10067.19s -> 10071.03s]  up. The more we take from the syndicate, the better. Right. I thought we were going to need
[10071.03s -> 10075.43s]  steel port on our side too. Drop around and see if we got any fancy. All right, I want some new
[10075.43s -> 10086.09s]  stuff. Grenades level two. No, it's too much. That's way too much money. What about, is there
[10086.09s -> 10099.22s]  any melee weapons I can buy? 27 grand. No way. Mollusk launcher? What do I get that?
[10099.94s -> 10111.10s]  I like the shotgun. What is this thing? The shark-o-matic? What are these weird cartoon
[10111.10s -> 10129.26s]  guns? These are TF2 guns. I need them. Oh, give me this thing. Yeah. I'll take that.
[10139.58s -> 10155.32s]  Buy grenades. Let's go. What do we got in here? You already own the shark one. Do? What the
[10155.32s -> 10168.90s]  fuck? What are these? All DLC weapons or something? I already own them. Well,
[10168.90s -> 10180.52s]  I'm going to equip them. Why not? Buy ammo. There's only one shot. Okay. Well, I'm kind of concerned.
[10181.64s -> 10212.04s]  Let's go. Find the sex doll. Who's talking? Oh, somebody died. Somebody died. Did I just kill
[10212.04s -> 10216.94s]  that person? No, that's not fair. That's not fair. They were already dead in the road and I just,
[10217.50s -> 10222.60s]  I didn't kill that person. They already were dead in the road. That shouldn't be attributed to me.
[10236.31s -> 10241.51s]  I don't, I hate that thing. I don't want that. All right. Find the sex doll.
[10245.03s -> 10251.19s]  What the hell is this? Oh, that? A little hobby of mine. Okay. I'm out of here. I don't mean like
[10251.19s -> 10255.43s]  that. Collectibles. They're collectible. You're supposed to try and find them all. People collect
[10255.43s -> 10260.87s]  some weird shit. Let's get out of here. How do they need to shoot something now? Don't you dare.
[10260.87s -> 10284.62s]  I didn't do anything. All right. Estates. I'm so sorry. Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty.
[10293.24s -> 10297.08s]  I have a question for all of you guys. For all of you, all you negative Andes.
[10298.54s -> 10310.46s]  Negative Andes. I have a question. Did you say go fuck yourself? Okay. Listen. Do you be honest?
[10310.46s -> 10315.26s]  I want you to be completely honest with me. Don't lie to me. Don't act like a dick. Just be honest.
[10315.26s -> 10321.93s]  Please. Do you, did you think that, I don't know, like, oh, all your friends are watching. So you
[10321.93s -> 10325.86s]  have to like make sure you type carefully because all they're going to hear. Did you think that
[10325.86s -> 10336.60s]  season one and two in Rick and Morty of Rick and Morty was good? Come on. I want you to be
[10336.60s -> 10353.00s]  honest with me. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So then so then we can agree, right?
[10354.68s -> 10365.56s]  Okay. Right. Up until the up until the Pickle Rick episode is when I liked it. Sounds perfect.
[10365.56s -> 10369.08s]  We wipe them off a corner. They'll think twice about coming back. You know what? I really think
[10369.08s -> 10374.04s]  it was when that copy pasta was first created. Everybody didn't want to watch the show anymore.
[10376.14s -> 10389.45s]  I think that's what it was. I think everybody collectively all went fuck. I think that's what
[10389.45s -> 10407.61s]  it was. That one guy ruined everything. Yeah. No, you know what? I think actually, you know what
[10407.61s -> 10414.18s]  it was for me? What I think what it was for me was the sauce thing, right? It was like, where's my
[10414.18s -> 10421.24s]  sauce? Right. I think that's what it was for me. I remember seeing the sauce thing and I was like,
[10421.32s -> 10431.59s]  fuck, fuck. Okay. Can I like this show anymore? I feel like I can't anymore. What the fuck?
[10435.53s -> 10442.60s]  What the hell does the weapon do? Good times.
[10445.16s -> 10463.26s]  Up to the north. I just what the fuck just happened, man? What happened? I'm so confused.
[10463.26s -> 10467.26s]  I don't even know how to play the game anymore. That was never supposed to happen in my life.
[10468.22s -> 10473.10s]  That was never a thing that was ever going to happen on screen. I was about to say this
[10473.10s -> 10484.76s]  weapon sucks. Okay. The Venture Brothers are good. All the old adult swimming shows were awesome.
[10488.06s -> 10494.10s]  I actually I don't really like new adult swim. I know I'm older, right? Am I just older and I
[10494.10s -> 10508.57s]  don't care? Or is this with my boomer Andy here? All right. Shark. How do I get the shark to come
[10508.57s -> 10537.85s]  up? Where's the shark? Where's the shark? Oh my goodness. What about these little things?
[10539.13s -> 10552.63s]  What does it do? What is happening? Ethical. I'm so confused. It makes them your friend.
[10553.96s -> 10582.36s]  Oh, I get it. All right. Who's my friend now? Shit. Stop. Can I? All right. I'm going to ethical
[10582.36s -> 10601.10s]  that. Come on. How do I revive? Let's do it again. I was so shocked by those those new
[10601.10s -> 10609.93s]  abilities that I couldn't play. Okay, so let's go. I was right. So don't swim all over the
[10609.93s -> 10615.05s]  city doing deals and shit. I remember Aqua teen. They'll think twice about coming back.
[10615.05s -> 10626.42s]  I wasn't a big fan of robot chicken. Not really. Robot chicken to me was just only family guy
[10626.42s -> 10632.79s]  cutaways. There was nothing else. It was just the family guy cutaways. And I liked family guy. I
[10632.79s -> 10636.87s]  thought I liked family guys like actual stuff they did in the first like six or seven seasons.
[10637.59s -> 10642.84s]  But it was that whole show was just a just cutaway jokes. I mean, I just was I was like,
[10642.84s -> 10661.54s]  yeah, it's okay. Yeah, the first five to 10 seasons of family guy were they had hit character.
[10661.54s -> 10670.94s]  I think they were fun and funny. You see smiling friends. It was fucking hilarious. Oh, yeah.
[10673.54s -> 10677.78s]  That's adult swim. But I feel like that's one of the only shows I've seen. I actually like
[10682.52s -> 10689.32s]  Come on. It's bugged out. This needed another fucking two years in development.
[10690.92s -> 10696.55s]  Yeah, but this should have been in development for two more years. Unbelievable. You know, I mean,
[10696.55s -> 10725.14s]  like other cops in the gang cars. Where did they come from? All right, let's go.
[10725.70s -> 10731.90s]  You don't look like having fun. Yeah, I'm having fun. What are you talking about?
[10732.54s -> 10738.18s]  This game's hilarious. I just I did the first hour of this game. I did not like I will be honest.
[10739.53s -> 10743.78s]  I felt like I wasn't even playing a game. Now I'm having this is a great game. I have fun.
[10744.50s -> 10748.66s]  I mean, I could I would appreciate it like another year in development, though.
[10759.03s -> 10761.91s]  He came up. I killed that guy so bad. He came off the driver's side.
[10770.17s -> 10776.28s]  Yeah, the first hour I was like, yeah, but I gave it time. And now I'm having a good time.
[10776.28s -> 10786.57s]  I think the game is really fun. Oh, God, is he dead? Oh, shit. This is going to kill him.
[10786.57s -> 10811.53s]  Whatever. I'll revive him. Come on. Don't kill me with this shit. Dude, don't even do that.
[10812.25s -> 10814.49s]  Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car.
[10820.89s -> 10845.94s]  Don't kill me, please. I don't want to restart. What is he shooting at? Oh, my God. I would love
[10845.94s -> 10861.02s]  to lower my notoriety if my passenger wasn't firing out the window. And there's a jump right
[10861.02s -> 10877.80s]  here. And it would be cool. Oh, my. Just get out. Just kill these fucking people following us.
[10877.80s -> 10892.95s]  They won't leave us alone. So just get rid of them. OK, let's go. Let's go. Bike. They spawned in.
[10892.95s -> 10902.87s]  They actually spawned in. What are you doing? Let's go. Get on the bike. Don't get in your
[10902.87s -> 10912.46s]  own car. What are you out of your mind? You idiot. Stop. Get on my whatever. I'm leaving you.
[10925.45s -> 10943.85s]  I need to hide. You fucking asshole. Oh, so I was back in Massachusetts, right? Because I'm saying
[10943.85s -> 10949.35s]  to be at the wedding stuff and I could tell I was back in Massachusetts. It's been it had been a
[10949.35s -> 10956.55s]  while. I was driving and I just hear I'm just sitting there. I pull through red light and I
[10956.55s -> 10964.26s]  just hear out the window. You fucking douchebag. Somebody was just screaming at somebody like out
[10964.26s -> 10976.30s]  the window. I was like, oh, yep. Oh, I I'm in I'm in Boston again. You passed it. Oh, shit.
[10982.71s -> 10988.07s]  Where is he going? It's called not paying any attention to being on complete and total autopilot
[10988.07s -> 11003.62s]  while I talk. What do you stop? What do you stop it? What is he doing? What are you doing?
[11005.27s -> 11009.27s]  Um, why are you doing that? There's nobody here to shoot at. He's just shooting at random.
[11009.27s -> 11026.58s]  All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna dump this guy. Are we hiding? Does this count as hiding?
[11026.58s -> 11050.65s]  Not two more. I guess should be two more years in development. Buy grenades.
[11052.25s -> 11068.97s]  What can I buy a melee weapon? Doesn't look like it. We're gonna get a melee weapon. You can.
[11069.77s -> 11072.49s]  Oh, it's the taser slot. Okay, it's not the actual punching slot.
[11073.45s -> 11094.28s]  Cool. Oh, sure. Okay. What would level? Okay.
[11097.94s -> 11142.28s]  Can I how do you switch? How do I switch weapons? How does it work? Okay. Okay. It's fun.
[11142.28s -> 11151.85s]  All right. So what now? Tank mayhem. You feel like blowing shit up? Go on. I'm all ears. Down the
[11151.85s -> 11158.76s]  route. The morning start user to the same. We drop a few pipe bombs under him. Fuck that. I'm saying
[11158.76s -> 11163.24s]  we use a tank. This may be the best idea you've ever had. Holy shit. Are you okay?
[11166.81s -> 11175.72s]  You need to go get the scout outfit now? Yeah, I do. I knew we needed a break from the team fortress
[11175.72s -> 11203.77s]  to joke, right? We can bring it back. Can you like kick? No. TF2 is not a joke. I said the TF2
[11204.57s -> 11211.74s]  joke. Not that the game is a joke. Were you listening? Come on, dude. $125,000 in property
[11211.74s -> 11227.61s]  damage. Sure. High value targets. Oh, this was in Saints Row 2. Yep. This is loud, by the way. I
[11227.61s -> 11254.22s]  realize how loud this just was. Wasn't the trick from Saints Row 2 to shoot fences? The fences
[11254.22s -> 11286.41s]  were worth an insane amount, right? No, 31. Okay, 40 combo. All right, I got it. The fences are
[11286.41s -> 11305.77s]  still the meta. Okay, good to know. Good to know. Okay, cool. I didn't want to do that.
[11311.16s -> 11319.14s]  Professor Genki. You ready to be a star? I thought we already were. Oh, no. What's the
[11319.14s -> 11325.11s]  running melee? You've been personally selected for a spot on a game show. You're not trying to
[11325.11s -> 11329.91s]  auction me off on some dating thing, are you? Trust me, you'll love this shit. Meet me and I'll
[11329.91s -> 11353.74s]  show you. You better be right. Oh, nice car. Nice car. He has no emotion when he's killing people.
[11354.54s -> 11371.30s]  I'm... Nice car immediately crashes it. This is Saints Row. Okay, this is Saints Row.
[11375.77s -> 11382.97s]  Hello, Steelport, and welcome to Professor Genki's super ethical reality climax. Time to see how the
[11382.97s -> 11389.29s]  game is playing. Fight your way through Professor Genki's super sparkle app for fun and profit.
[11389.93s -> 11396.89s]  Now with every man, woman, and tiger shot, your prize money goes up. Look out. No one likes it
[11396.89s -> 11402.33s]  when you shoot a panda. Don't shoot panda. Once you've collected enough money,
[11402.33s -> 11406.49s]  the door to the lab opens up, and you're free to go. But if you think it's that easy,
[11408.01s -> 11415.05s]  you've never seen Genki before. Oh, and one more thing. On this show, no one gets to take a break.
[11415.05s -> 11421.45s]  If you want to stay in the fight, be sure to shoot the worst aid target. Good luck. It's murder time.
[11422.01s -> 11432.28s]  Fun time. Earn money by destroying targets, killing enemies, and exiting the arena before time runs
[11432.28s -> 11437.96s]  out. If you destroy things in quick succession, you'll earn a bonus. Let's go. Welcome to Professor
[11437.96s -> 11445.96s]  Genki's super epic reality climax. Time is fun time, right Bobby? You got it, Zack. If our contestants
[11445.96s -> 11451.80s]  can survive the deadly traps, armed mascots, and those freakishly huge hunters, they can win a
[11451.80s -> 11459.16s]  hefty pile of cash. This game looks deadly because it is, but it's still probably safer than driving
[11459.16s -> 11465.80s]  in Steelport. Our competitor isn't from Steelport this time, Zack. Genki is watching the leader of
[11465.80s -> 11471.80s]  the Saints, the world famous Stillwater Street Gang. As many times as this former gang banger
[11471.80s -> 11478.28s]  has been shot at, blown up, run over, and generally put through hell, this competition probably seems
[11478.28s -> 11484.36s]  pretty routine. Um, routine maybe, but lucrative. You are going to make Professor Genki sized
[11484.36s -> 11494.39s]  dollars driving hoes around, that's for sure. Chuching. Destruction. Our contestant is clapping
[11494.39s -> 11499.35s]  her back in Steelport. Have you ever been to Stillwater, Bobby? I did, and it wasn't a good
[11499.35s -> 11506.15s]  trip. My car got covered in sewage by a passing septic truck. Really? What did you do to piss off
[11506.79s -> 11510.87s]  the driver? Destruction. I didn't do a damn thing. I just wish I had rented a convertible.
[11510.87s -> 11516.79s]  Wait, you were in the car? Is that? It is. We have a present. A present is in the maze.
[11521.35s -> 11534.70s]  This is really amazing shooting. Cash in pocket. Carnage. Quite a performance so far.
[11540.10s -> 11545.38s]  Like sticking a fork in a socket. How can anyone recover from that?
[11546.10s -> 11555.13s]  I hope the money is worth this. So Bobby, how do you clean sewage out of a convertible?
[11555.13s -> 11560.41s]  With a tumor brush. Really? No, I let the rental company take care of it. Are you kidding me?
[11560.41s -> 11565.85s]  What's that kind of shitty of you? Not as shitty as what this contestant is doing to those mascots.
[11566.49s -> 11573.66s]  Mayhem. How do you shake that one off? I'm trying to jump over it. I can't jump over this?
[11573.74s -> 11581.51s]  Valuable seconds. That's some great action.
[11583.99s -> 11596.86s]  Every shot seems to hit something today. He's not dead. I didn't get points for that. I didn't get
[11596.86s -> 11627.51s]  points yet. I'm still getting a hit marker. What's going on? Chaos. Carnage. I'm making a lot of
[11627.51s -> 11649.72s]  money now. Cool. We've only just begun. I'm surprised the syndicate is still standing. How
[11649.72s -> 11654.44s]  many times did you get electrocuted? I don't know. I'm not saying we should. All right,
[11654.44s -> 11668.52s]  then see you at the broken chile. Is that a cement mixer? What the fuck? Oh my god. What is this?
[11671.94s -> 11683.03s]  Down's wasted. He has the face. He's wearing the head. He's driving a car with it. What?
[11688.42s -> 11731.75s]  Damn, I'm good. Holy shit. Okay. Fucking douchebag. What is this?
[11732.63s -> 11751.02s]  Oh my goodness. Okay. Give me a fucking goddamn controller. That's the fucking mouse. Whatever.
[11753.13s -> 11758.89s]  Controller aim is just like, okay, I'm putting my head under water and then playing.
[11763.38s -> 11774.70s]  You really don't want to ride with me. Let's go. I'm surprised the syndicate is still standing
[11774.70s -> 11778.54s]  after all this shit we've thrown at him. I don't see a reason to stop. Not saying we should.
[11779.10s -> 11784.74s]  Your cousin from Boston. It's a fucking lager. You don't know what a lager is, dude.
[11785.62s -> 11802.28s]  I'm your cousin. I wasn't looking. It's always so funny that Boston people in commercials,
[11802.28s -> 11810.04s]  TV shows and whatever, they're always a cartoon character. Like, don't you just imagine that
[11810.04s -> 11813.24s]  all the people that are like all the Boston people that are in all these commercials and
[11813.24s -> 11832.42s]  TV shows are going to bring out a big cartoon mallet. I'm a cartoon character? No, you're not.
[11835.22s -> 11836.42s]  Wait, I can do that?
[11836.98s -> 11859.53s]  I don't know that. I don't know how I could go all the way back like this.
[11860.33s -> 11868.89s]  How far can I go? We'll see. Holy shit. Can I just be like this for the rest of the day?
[11869.61s -> 11886.86s]  My old chair didn't do that. That old chair sucked, by the way. Can I be honest? Nice. Okay.
[11890.81s -> 11904.55s]  That chair sucked. That chair made you. Is it better? Yeah. I don't want to
[11905.19s -> 11908.79s]  say too too much about like, oh, yeah, wow, everything's amazing. But I definitely feel
[11909.43s -> 11914.42s]  it doesn't look more comfortable. I told you there's a crank on the back of the chair that
[11914.42s -> 11924.26s]  I can like crank, crank, crank, crank, crank and get it. Oh my God. What the get on the bike.
[11925.22s -> 11937.59s]  Shani, give me good news. We're going to burn powder to the ground. That's
[11938.39s -> 11945.61s]  okay. Let's go stream. See you there, Shani. Wait. Oh boy. Yeah. So something I didn't know
[11946.65s -> 11952.49s]  when you get, yeah, it's the, it's the gaming chair with the, um, it's such an E
[11954.71s -> 11961.35s]  as whatever the Herman Miller gaming one is. Check what it's E. No, no, not the easy gamer.
[11963.83s -> 11968.55s]  The embody. Yeah. It's the one that was, it's the blue one, the blue and the black one.
[11969.11s -> 11981.43s]  Cause I, although the gaming chair is, I don't, I don't like the fucking, I hate those things.
[11984.31s -> 11995.70s]  Putting your tampons and let's do this. The chair that I had before. Yeah. This is way,
[11996.58s -> 12008.15s]  way more expensive. I had the chair that I had before, I think was 500 or 600.
[12010.04s -> 12017.19s]  And it was like, Oh, back support, lumbar and cushion. And this to me feels more like a,
[12017.19s -> 12024.62s]  like a chair, like a chair, like a real chair. I think the problem that I had a lot of times
[12024.62s -> 12031.64s]  sitting in a chair for like an office chair, whatever is it was so cushiony that I felt
[12031.64s -> 12037.48s]  like I wasn't sitting in a chair. This to me is, this to me is a chair, a real chair.
[12039.32s -> 12043.96s]  Did I just drive in a circle? Oh, I'm sorry. No, I'm serious. This is my kind of plan.
[12043.96s -> 12051.66s]  What are we going? I forget what happened. All right, we're good. Let's get inside.
[12055.10s -> 12064.01s]  But I mean, I think I'm trying to think of how much these retail for a lot in charge here,
[12064.01s -> 12068.17s]  probably knows where to find the office and see if they're hiding under their desk.
[12070.58s -> 12072.90s]  But let me put it this way. My back feels like it's
[12074.17s -> 12079.13s]  propped up. Because before I kind of could just sink in and slouch a little. But this is like,
[12079.13s -> 12088.04s]  I'm in the chair. I'm sitting in a chair. Seriously. You both assume with sniper rifles
[12088.04s -> 12100.02s]  from like 15 feet away, you fucking assholes. I couldn't even reload. You know, also I like
[12100.02s -> 12108.17s]  about this thing. Maybe I'll show you. You can pull the seat forward. Alright, so here's like,
[12108.17s -> 12113.06s]  here's your ass, right? Well, this is like your ass sitting in the chair. I'll just show you.
[12113.62s -> 12116.50s]  No, I mean, I like pajamas on. I'll show you like tomorrow, the next day.
[12120.14s -> 12126.38s]  The bottom of the chair. If you've got a big fat ass, you could this the ass part of the chair
[12126.38s -> 12131.42s]  can be extended, which is a huge deal to me. An absolutely massive fucking deal.
[12132.70s -> 12136.06s]  So this has a setting that you can adjust for a huge ass.
[12136.94s -> 12141.18s]  It's in charge here probably knows where to find Loren. Let's head to the office and see if they're
[12141.18s -> 12147.67s]  hiding under the seat is like collapsible. It comes in and out. You like can pull the bottom out so
[12147.67s -> 12156.09s]  it's why like longer and wider almost. And I feel like my big fat ass is sitting in this comfortably.
[12156.73s -> 12191.64s]  Okay, I gotta go upstairs. Find a way upstairs. Let's go. I can't get up there. There we go.
[12191.64s -> 12196.44s]  You're never going to get a job after you stream. Because I have a huge ass.
[12197.48s -> 12203.53s]  Oh, Mr. Albukson, we're really happy. We really think you're very qualified for this job here at
[12203.53s -> 12207.85s]  Stevenson and Stevenson Associates. But I'm sorry, your ass is too big. We're not going to be able
[12207.85s -> 12212.01s]  to fit you any chairs. No chairs in this office will be able to do it. I'm sorry, but your ass
[12212.01s -> 12229.16s]  is too big. What are you talking about? Why are you standing in front of a Gatling gun? I got this.
[12232.68s -> 12240.54s]  Why why why why why why why am I gonna put a grenade in his mouth? That's gonna hurt us.
[12243.19s -> 12267.86s]  Oh boy. Yep. Come on, let's go go go go go. The arm rest can can move
[12268.50s -> 12274.60s]  like wider or. I like it. Let's see after like a week though, because that's a real test here.
[12276.02s -> 12282.50s]  I know a lot of guys know I have pretty bad like back and spine like chest pain shit.
[12282.50s -> 12291.25s]  it I'll give you my real assessment in like a week cuz I feel like it's gonna
[12291.25s -> 12296.80s]  take a while for me to figure that out and I'm not gonna bullshit you I'm not
[12296.80s -> 12301.96s]  gonna give you horse shit trust me you know you know yeah I come on you think
[12301.96s -> 12305.98s]  I'm gonna feed you horse shit no I'm gonna take what I think give it a week

[12488.90s -> 12493.54s]  things the easy way so what's the plan kill everyone we see and find Loren

[12542.50s -> 12545.54s]  where I one of the funny things I thought was the funniest thing in those
[12545.54s -> 12554.90s]  videos what I really tried to capture all right bye I always wanted to drive
[12554.90s -> 12560.22s]  really fast and I would like whether it was like stir or like boo and mostly
[12560.22s -> 12563.42s]  stealth it was like oh yeah you drive the opposite ways fast you can I drive
[12563.42s -> 12567.74s]  the other way as fast as I can and we're gonna line it up perfectly so when I
[12567.74s -> 12571.98s]  dive out of the car it's the perfect angle and the perfect amount of force
[12571.98s -> 12577.62s]  where I'm gonna fly out and I'm going to hit my fucking head directly into the
[12577.62s -> 12596.72s]  front of your car oh my goodness but uh but yeah but that was me though that was
[12596.72s -> 12622.92s]  I did that apparently that was me it fucking DDT what did I do yeah I would
