[4.86s -> 14.34s]  Now, thanks to Myth for setting that up. Go follow Myth on YouTube. He's a really good dude.
[14.34s -> 18.25s]  That was a lot of fun. I wish I played a little better, but I was okay. Whatever.
[21.69s -> 28.31s]  You got popular on FPS games. That's, guys, go back and watch my scout tutorial where I explain
[28.31s -> 34.12s]  what A and D does. You understand? That's what I mean when I'm saying there was boogers coming
[34.12s -> 39.40s]  out of my nose. Like, okay, so A and D is a stray, right? That's, we're talking, it was a different
[39.40s -> 54.90s]  world 10 years ago. Okay. More? How do I spell this? Should I make my title Morty? Mortuary Morty?
[54.90s -> 64.12s]  I think I wanted that. I think I wanted that. I think it has to be that, right? Yeah. I don't
[64.12s -> 86.89s]  care. Yeah. It's going to be like, Morty. Mortuary. What do you think? Is that bad? Should I change it?
[86.89s -> 109.03s]  Dude, this is so bright in my fucking face. It's way too bright. Lights off too? Lights off? Well,
[109.03s -> 142.71s]  this looks like shit. Why does it look so bad? Why do I look like I'm on a VHS tape? Does this
[142.71s -> 173.24s]  game suck? There we go. That's better. No, it's not. Is that better? That's good, right? Is that like
[173.24s -> 195.32s]  that? A little bit worse? I think that's fine. That's fine. All right. Mortuary Assistant. I know,
[195.32s -> 200.46s]  like, I hate Rick and Morty, but don't leave because you don't like the joke. Leave because
[200.46s -> 204.47s]  that was terrible at Call of Duty and you were, like, expecting something else. All right. Let's
[204.47s -> 224.25s]  go. Season six is coming soon. Why is this on my other monitor over here? Why is this over here?
[225.21s -> 232.89s]  This monitor. How do I change that? I don't want it on this monitor. I want it over here.
[232.89s -> 248.86s]  How do I do that? Hey, what the fuck? Win, shift, and arrow. Win, shift, and arrow. I didn't do
[248.86s -> 300.65s]  anything. I took it off full screen. There we go. All right. Can you see it? There we go. All right.
[300.65s -> 313.11s]  How does it look for settings? Is this fine? VSync 120. Let's go. This is probably fine.
[313.11s -> 322.22s]  Tutorial tips. Yeah. Ultra HD. High quality. I'll turn it up a little. Hopefully this is not,
[322.22s -> 334.54s]  like, a lot of screamers or something. All right. Okay. Move. Okay. Let's go. New shift.
[334.54s -> 346.09s]  Invert Y. It fixes a bug. Subtitles on. All right. Let's fucking go. New shift.
[362.95s -> 370.62s]  What happened to the POG content? I want to see Call of Duty. You missed it.
[370.62s -> 381.35s]  I'm so glad. Thank you. I'll never understand why you chose such a macabre field. There's nothing
[381.35s -> 386.46s]  disturbing about it. It's just that... I thought that was real actors.
[398.82s -> 404.66s]  They actually have everyone they need, but my old teacher, Mr. Delver, transferred me to his office
[404.66s -> 410.10s]  to finalize my internship there. Oh, well, that's good. I remember you mentioning him.
[410.74s -> 416.82s]  Where's he located? Are you moving away from me? No. It feels like an AI-generated scene.
[416.90s -> 422.58s]  He's actually located around here. Like, oh, in Blender. This is what's going to happen.
[423.64s -> 427.24s]  I don't like that. Grandma. Even I've heard things about that place.
[428.95s -> 434.47s]  Just be worried about you. Don't make up stories. Death is a scary thing to a lot of people,
[434.47s -> 438.87s]  and we try to explain things we don't understand, and we want comfort when we lose someone we love.
[438.87s -> 443.67s]  I mean, no one's embalming any ghost bodies or whatever. It's fine. Right, right. I'm sorry.
[444.23s -> 444.73s]  Bring!
[451.90s -> 457.48s]  Shit, that title is so bad. People are going to hate me. I'm actually regretting that title.
[457.48s -> 473.94s]  If I want that, just take it, please. It should be yours anyway. Thanks. All right.
[473.94s -> 479.58s]  Enough spooky stuff. I'm so proud of you. When is all this happening? When do you start?
[480.30s -> 484.31s]  I've actually been there for a few weeks now. My review is tomorrow.
[486.31s -> 503.03s]  What is happening? All right. Okay. I was like, what's going on? First day. Riverfield Mortuary.
[515.22s -> 527.90s]  This is loud. All right. Here we go. I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty again. Hold on.
[532.17s -> 576.30s]  That did not work. I guess it's just the way it is. That's different now. That's better. Better
[576.30s -> 590.30s]  getting better. Halfway. Halfway. Halfway. All right. There we go. Okay. So what do we do?
[590.30s -> 612.41s]  We can't break the vase. Okay. Rebecca, one last thing I forgot to give to you. Please grab a
[612.41s -> 621.83s]  pencil from my desk and sign it. Thanks. From Zoe. Good luck. Use to sign the paperwork on the
[621.83s -> 628.63s]  door. Access Quick Inventory and choose the item you wish to use. Most but not all places where
[628.63s -> 638.55s]  the I okay. That's the right mouse button. I can't use that here. Signed. All right.
[656.49s -> 668.63s]  Great. Perfect timing. I just finished with Mr. Dalton here. You're just sitting here? Please wheel
[668.63s -> 674.89s]  him back to cold storage and bring us Mrs. Page. Moving the deceased. Use the gurney by standing
[674.89s -> 679.45s]  behind it and pressing the gurney interact key and walk backwards with the gurney down the hall.
[679.45s -> 708.25s]  All right. Oh, where was there? Bring a body in or out of cold storage. Open the bay with the
[708.25s -> 739.32s]  body's name. Pull out the rack and then move the cart over to it. Okay. Oswald Dalton. Oh. Oh,
[739.32s -> 783.66s]  shit. Okay. Jesus. Okay. Get in there. Wait, is he just floating? How do I push him in? What happened?
[783.66s -> 818.25s]  Oh, shit. No, get over here. Come back. Come back. How do I? What do I do? How do I push him in?
[818.25s -> 834.50s]  What's what's going on? I don't understand what's going on here. He's he's he's literally stuck.
[834.50s -> 853.70s]  What? Okay. Pull this out. Then you put him in. He goes up. And then we put we put we what do we do?
[853.70s -> 860.65s]  I push him from here, right? Use the gurney. Get it out of the way and push him in. Dude, I tried.
[860.65s -> 877.29s]  That's literally what I tried doing before and it didn't work. He was frozen. Okay. I was clicking
[877.29s -> 891.46s]  and dragging. I swear to God. I was trying to find a sprint. Okay. All right. I'm just finishing
[891.46s -> 895.78s]  up something here. So why don't you grab the clipboard and start recording identifying marks.
[896.34s -> 900.26s]  I'll get out of your way when you're done and let you hop in here. Clipboard used for forms
[900.26s -> 909.22s]  and keeping track of mortuary tasks. All right. Okay. Record any distinguishing marks. Enter
[909.22s -> 917.16s]  markings into computer. Inspecting a body. Hover the cursor over unique markings such as moles,
[917.16s -> 923.88s]  scratches, bruises and interact with them to record them. Okay. All right. What do we got?
[923.96s -> 932.28s]  Got a ball here. All right. There's a mole. Wait. There's another one here.
[936.94s -> 953.50s]  Okay. Back up. Got a bruise. That's it. What about the head? These old windows never stay latched.
[961.66s -> 984.87s]  Nothing on the head. Wait. Keep going all the way. Bruise. Bruise. Great. Bruising. Climb on in
[984.87s -> 989.24s]  here and put everything into the record system. Don't forget to take the printout to the front
[989.24s -> 996.70s]  desk so Zo can add it to the packet for the family. After that, we'll get started. Okay.
[998.02s -> 1006.34s]  Click the record system icon to open the program. What was that? I didn't say anything. You all
[1006.34s -> 1017.45s]  right? Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry. Okay. That was what a weirdo. All right. Click the record system icon
[1017.45s -> 1021.77s]  to open the program. Match the sections on your clipboard to the corresponding sections on the
[1021.77s -> 1027.61s]  computer. Once all findings have been entered into the system, click submit. Print out involving
[1027.61s -> 1033.05s]  records and file the records in whatever. All right. So he's going to match the system. Let's go.
[1034.86s -> 1042.92s]  Name. I don't... What's the name? Dorothy Page. Age. 87. Head. There was a...
[1045.14s -> 1056.49s]  On the right leg, there was a contusion. On the left leg, there was a rash. There was a contusion
[1056.49s -> 1065.69s]  on the left arm. There was a contusion on the right arm. On the right shoulder, there was a mole
[1066.41s -> 1108.06s]  and that and that's it. Submit it. Okay. Where'd it go? Why were there clues over here?
[1108.06s -> 1116.74s]  Where did it print out from? I need to get it from the printer. Where's the printer?
[1116.74s -> 1122.90s]  Oh. All right. So I got to file up front so they are available if requested. All right. So we
[1122.90s -> 1145.22s]  got to file this. Okay. Time to embalm. All right. I've set everything out so you can just go ahead
[1145.22s -> 1165.03s]  and get started. I'll be monitoring. Everything's on your list there if you need it. Pizza's burning.
[1165.35s -> 1173.29s]  There's no pizza in the oven. Okay. I'm ready to... So where do we do that? I'm missing something.
[1173.93s -> 1200.44s]  Setting the face. Oh. What? Oh. Moisturizing wipe. Injector. I can't hold anything else.
[1200.44s -> 1216.89s]  Okay. I can only carry two large items at a time. Okay. So I need to use the injector, right?
[1216.89s -> 1230.01s]  I'm missing something. So I have in my... I don't need these... I don't need a moisturizing wipe.
[1230.01s -> 1239.58s]  Use for injecting cavity fluid directly into organs. Artery forceps. Scalpel. Just take
[1239.58s -> 1248.73s]  everything. Setting needles. Eye caps. IV reservoir bag. I can't hold anything else.
[1248.73s -> 1255.16s]  Okay. So I got to get this started, right? Oh. All right. Wire Josh up with needle
[1255.16s -> 1282.74s]  injector and settings needles. Am I doing this right? Holy shit. What did I just do?
[1282.74s -> 1338.95s]  Oh. Wait. Do I double click it? There we go. Insert eye caps. Are they in? All right.
[1339.43s -> 1351.38s]  Okay. Mix embalming fluid. Gatorade, menthol, humectant, and formaldehyde.
[1351.38s -> 1370.34s]  Okay. Where is that? Okay. Cavity fluid. Mix embalming fluid and pump. Is it already in there?
[1370.34s -> 1377.45s]  No. Okay. Here it is. Okay. Take it. I can't hold anything else.
[1377.45s -> 1382.79s]  Really? How do I... How do I... How do I put this wipe down? How do I drop shit?
[1382.79s -> 1398.84s]  I can't hold anything else. Really? Get it back.
[1401.86s -> 1407.56s]  Sometimes we get chemicals that haven't been stored properly and it can make them pop like that.
[1407.64s -> 1410.68s]  Backpack. Just keep doing your thing. I'll get it.
[1410.68s -> 1423.16s]  I can't hold anything else. That was not normal.
[1423.16s -> 1433.80s]  I can't hold anything else. That sounded fucked up.
[1433.80s -> 1467.88s]  All right. We'll put this shit in first. Okay. Hire the audio guy. I am. I genuinely am.
[1467.88s -> 1474.46s]  I am genuinely hiring an audio magician to give me... I don't care how much it costs.
[1474.46s -> 1480.20s]  It's not the noise gate. If I turn the noise gate off and scream, it'll still happen. It's
[1480.20s -> 1486.90s]  this microphone. Okay. I tested it with the noise gate off. I tested with no settings on it all.
[1486.90s -> 1501.30s]  Just the mic plugged right into the computer. All right. So now I have to... How do I plug it in?
[1501.30s -> 1506.90s]  Make an incision in the cartoided artery and jugular vein. Okay.
[1513.03s -> 1518.71s]  Okay. So some items need to be used. What do I need to do with this?
[1518.71s -> 1533.58s]  Did I try to put the clipboard in her neck? I'm missing something.
[1533.58s -> 1547.82s]  Use forceps to clamp tubing to both veins. I need tubing. Where do I get the tubing?
[1547.82s -> 1559.48s]  Where are the forceps? Do I have the forceps? No. Where are the... Are the forceps already in there?
[1559.48s -> 1585.72s]  Where's the tube? The window? Window. Stop pretending. I don't... On the window sill.
[1585.72s -> 1590.28s]  Oh, this is a bag. This is like a... Okay. This is like a baggie.
[1590.28s -> 1598.20s]  I thought it was going to be like a big like snaked up thing. All right. Okay.
[1600.10s -> 1669.06s]  Now engage pump and let the body drain. So subway for lunch. Turn it off.
[1672.78s -> 1683.54s]  Wait, I didn't know I had to turn it off. I didn't know I had to turn it off. Please help.
[1683.70s -> 1700.81s]  Okay. Turn off pump. Remove tubes and close the incision.
[1700.81s -> 1719.50s]  Fill an empty reservoir bag with cavity fluid. Okay. Then... Then insert the trocar into the
[1719.50s -> 1724.54s]  cavity. Insert the trocar until it stops to begin the flow of embalming fluid.
[1724.54s -> 1740.50s]  Once that cavity is full, hold the trocar back and rotate it. Then reinsert whatever.
[1740.50s -> 1766.79s]  Oh! I don't want anyone to do this to me. I don't want anyone to do this to me.
[1766.79s -> 1775.05s]  Shoot me out of a cannon. Just... Okay. Put me in a cannon and during... I have like a big celebration
[1775.05s -> 1780.74s]  where everybody's here. Like I've got family and friends. Load me into a gonzo cannon from the
[1780.74s -> 1786.65s]  Muppets and just have it be like tie a bunch of fireworks to me and just shoot me in the space
[1786.65s -> 1800.41s]  and everyone just cheer. I don't... I don't want anyone to do this to me. No. High enough where
[1800.41s -> 1809.13s]  it's not going to be a problem. I'm talking about like... And I'm like in the stratosphere
[1809.13s -> 1812.33s]  and they just get to watch like this big and have it... I don't know. Have like a cool
[1813.06s -> 1825.48s]  display. Into orbit. No, not into orbit. Shoot me out of a fucking cannon. Don't do this to me.
[1825.48s -> 1846.60s]  Mix cleaners in bathroom closet to create tank cleaner. Okay. Cleaner base. Uh, more...
[1846.60s -> 1853.88s]  I can't hold anything else. I can't hold anything else. Is that it? Tank cleaner. What do I do?
[1855.42s -> 1861.38s]  Mix cleaners in bathroom closet to create tank cleaner. Then pour into the embalming pump.
[1862.02s -> 1874.89s]  I need an embalming pump. Where do I get that? You did it. How do I... That's not it. You just
[1874.89s -> 1885.22s]  used it. Turn it on. How do I turn it on? Drop the thing. You got the tank. Oh, okay. All right. I see
[1885.22s -> 1914.50s]  what you mean. And then what am I doing? And then pour into the embalming pump. Okay. Apply
[1914.50s -> 1948.68s]  moisturizer. Does it get more red? Okay. Moisturizer. Apply moisturizer. Okay. Yeah.
[1948.68s -> 1962.31s]  Wipe the face. Tell you what. Why don't you go ahead and head out? I'll take over from here.
[1965.13s -> 1972.26s]  Are you sure? I just got here. Don't worry. You're doing great. I'll get the last of your paperwork
[1972.26s -> 1978.58s]  sorted today and call you in for your first shift. All right. I'm ready. See you later.
[1978.58s -> 2001.83s]  That wasn't moisturizer. That was acid. It was just really weird. So some stuff fell over.
[2001.83s -> 2008.07s]  That's not a big deal. No, I know. It wasn't even my fault, but he sent me home right after that.
[2008.79s -> 2014.31s]  I'm just really worried. He was supposed to finalize my stuff today. And he said he would,
[2014.31s -> 2020.23s]  right? TV goes on top of that, right? You don't. That's where it places the TV. That's a good thing.
[2020.23s -> 2025.91s]  Yeah. It just didn't feel like he meant it. Like he just said it to get me out of the building.
[2026.87s -> 2034.04s]  Wait a sec. I have another call. Hello? Hey, Rebecca. It's Raymond. Oh, hi, Mr. Delver. Look,
[2034.04s -> 2058.36s]  if I did anything wrong today, just- No, no. What's this guy's problem? Yeah. Are you sure?
[2058.36s -> 2074.44s]  I mean, of course. Yeah. I don't want people sucking juices out of my body.
[2074.44s -> 2086.87s]  I'm on my way right now. I hope you feel better. Bye. Holy shit. That was him. He signed me on.
[2086.87s -> 2097.54s]  He needs me to come in tonight. Thanks. I have to go like right now. I'll talk to you later.
[2099.48s -> 2108.65s]  All right. Let's go. First day. First day of work. Okay. The sensitivity got worse.
[2109.78s -> 2118.84s]  You see that? That's scary. That's some scary shit. Why did it change that on me? And why is
[2118.84s -> 2130.71s]  there a microwave here? Why is there a microwave on the ground? This is an insane place for this.
[2136.54s -> 2157.37s]  Okay, let's go. Wolfios? Keys. All right. Temporary items do not take up space in your inventory.
[2157.37s -> 2176.10s]  All right. Morty. Morty. We're going to play more than one song, Morty. No, we're going to play more
[2176.10s -> 2199.72s]  than one song. That's not how it works, Morty. All right. Let's go. Holy fuck. Minus two. Yeah.
[2201.00s -> 2210.49s]  Look at the title. And everybody's talking shit about Rick and Morty. Like, you laugh at that
[2210.49s -> 2217.13s]  show. I know you do. You sit there with the iPad sitting on your chest, and they get into some
[2217.13s -> 2223.83s]  crazy hijinks, and you kind of go, all right. Okay. And then you slam the iPad shut because
[2223.83s -> 2226.47s]  you hear somebody come into the room. You don't want anyone to think you're watching it for some
[2226.47s -> 2254.94s]  reason. Who cares? What happened? I stubbed my toe. I'm telling you. I'm armed. Don't come in. I'm
[2254.94s -> 2274.36s]  armed. Mr. Delver. I need help. Someone's outside the mortuary. What? This is very sudden. But
[2274.36s -> 2280.94s]  listen to me. You have to start right away. He's on the phone. It's him. Sorry. He's going like that.
[2290.23s -> 2293.91s]  Oh, earbuds. This isn't funny. Stop. You need to take this seriously.
[2293.91s -> 2300.54s]  This is insane. I'll just leave. I'll just fucking leave. You can't leave, Rebecca. I can't allow
[2300.54s -> 2307.03s]  that for you or for others. It's far too dangerous. What am I supposed to do then?
[2307.03s -> 2314.07s]  Most bodies I work with at night are fine. So we stay. What happened to my chat? I can't read the
[2314.07s -> 2325.83s]  chat. The embalm. File the paperwork. Stay. I left some things for you on the desk. I'll call again
[2325.83s -> 2332.60s]  when you get to the embalm. All right. This is where I'm going to go like this. No, wait. This is insane.
[2333.32s -> 2338.12s]  Oh, that's supposed to be him. I was going to just go like this, like jump at him. This is so stupid.
[2338.68s -> 2343.94s]  It's just some hazing for the new girl or something. Just turn that back. Turn that back on.
[2343.94s -> 2356.90s]  What are you doing? And do your job. Oh, what the fuck? You're right. The ghost is here. You're
[2356.90s -> 2363.72s]  right. You should definitely come in here. It's fucked up in here, man. And then when it comes in,
[2363.72s -> 2401.30s]  club them with the fucking bowling pin. All right, let's go. Key, key, save recorder. Okay. How do I
[2401.30s -> 2432.23s]  get? That's not it. Quitting tomorrow. I'm going to break through the windows. I'm sorry, but this
[2432.23s -> 2438.39s]  entire thing is extremely unprofessional. If this is how you treat new hires, I don't think I can
[2438.39s -> 2505.30s]  work for you. Don't trust the phones. Anything can be manipulated. Burn the correct body.
[2507.51s -> 2523.51s]  What? In this cabinet? This is insane. Just be a professional one. Grab a body and get started.
[2523.51s -> 2526.79s]  This is the part where I take the tennis ball and I just don't know what to do.
[2526.79s -> 2535.70s]  So I sit over there in the corner and I go like, can't go, can't go. Fucking demons. Can't go.
[2535.70s -> 2550.84s]  Somewhere. I just sit there for like 10 minutes. He could have just stayed on the phone.
[2570.42s -> 2573.62s]  Oh, shit. That was important.
[2574.10s -> 2585.69s]  The further you are from possession, the more time you have. The closer you are,
[2586.33s -> 2588.73s]  the more the demon will find the demon's name. All right, find the demon's name.
[2588.73s -> 2596.25s]  Allowing you information to guess its name and the body. It's about the only way.
[2596.25s -> 2604.62s]  Fucking Eric. It's Eric. Don't think of just scribble.
[2604.78s -> 2614.26s]  Notice anything strange? It's starting to go past the pencil in the desk.
[2616.42s -> 2626.01s]  Checking from time to time can give an idea. It's Eric.
[2645.64s -> 2652.15s]  Just burn them all. Yeah, what's stopping me from just burning all of them and being like, hey,
[2652.15s -> 2662.07s]  I just burned them all. I got the demon. Wait, should I not be doing this? Just burn them all.
[2662.07s -> 2666.95s]  No, no, you're supposed to listen to all the tapes. No, you know, you're not doing it right.
[2668.78s -> 2695.21s]  Hey, Mr. Dover.
[2705.35s -> 2741.90s]  He's like, you didn't play my game. What the fuck? Is it over? That was it. Do I have a save?
[2741.90s -> 2761.90s]  Oh, God damn it. All right. All right. Don't just be an idiot. Keys. Let's go. All right. Let's go.
[2761.90s -> 2801.96s]  I'm not messing around right now. Doesn't he call? I thought he doesn't. He calls. Doesn't he call?
[2829.86s -> 2844.87s]  What's the code? This one's got like Cheeto dust on it. It's this one.
[2844.95s -> 2858.42s]  Okay. Okay. Where did he say that was? I forgot immediately. Instantly. I forgot what he said.
[2858.42s -> 2865.51s]  My ID is. Where is it? He said my ID is the drawer or something.
[2906.55s -> 2911.98s]  Think about just script. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, get away from me.
[2911.98s -> 2917.46s]  If you notice anything strange, it's starting to take hold. Okay. What are you? There's a notepad
[2917.46s -> 2930.33s]  and a pencil on desk. Checking from time to time. Okay. Embalm each body with a special
[2930.33s -> 2935.37s]  regent from the cabinet. Use the leading strips from the cabinet to attempt to reveal demonic
[2935.37s -> 2962.02s]  sigils. Okay. So we got to get a body out. Okay. All right. So we got to get a body
[2963.67s -> 2983.13s]  and we just have to do the process of embalming. All right. It's not. Oh, it's a different name.
[2984.01s -> 2993.40s]  Robert Hood. Nothing. Cordell Armstrong. Dorothy Vaughn. Okay. Dorothy Vaughn. Come on out.
[2994.04s -> 3026.58s]  Yeah. It's random. All right. Okay. Just leave. I'm not gonna just leave. All right. Here we go.
[3026.58s -> 3031.45s]  We need to do. All right. You've got something going on. Do I need to do this?
[3039.80s -> 3059.42s]  Head bruise. A couple of head bruises. All right. What about the arm? Yep. All right. Nothing here.
[3059.42s -> 3081.22s]  Anything here? Nope. Somebody just tapped on the window. What? Is that it? I think that's it.
[3081.22s -> 3101.90s]  That's it, right? Okay. Name. Age 22. Contusion in the head. Right shoulder. There's a problem.
[3101.90s -> 3116.60s]  Rash on the arm. And that's it. Submit it. Let's go. Okay. Give me the cabinet. What the fuck is this?
[3131.61s -> 3133.37s]  What is this?
[3177.32s -> 3181.16s]  Location. You will need to uncover these sigils to use them.
[3182.28s -> 3187.80s]  Hold a letting strip up while wandering the mortuary. If it begins to smolder and burn,
[3187.80s -> 3193.08s]  you're close. When the paper will bust. It's here. It's right in front of me.
[3194.28s -> 3210.70s]  What? This thing's fucking burning. Ow. Where is it? Are you out here? Use the night shift database
[3210.70s -> 3232.34s]  to decide what reagent. Am I getting close? I don't wait. I don't get it.
[3233.46s -> 3247.91s]  This is. Ow. What? I don't understand. What? How would it just happen? This person's a demon.
[3247.91s -> 3271.62s]  Sigil revealed. Where? Look for the mark now. Mark of Satan. Where's the mark? No, no, no, no, no,
[3271.62s -> 3283.82s]  no. Turn the lights off. I don't see anything on the furniture in the room on the furniture
[3291.77s -> 3299.26s]  on the wall. Can it just be anywhere? Like that? It was just like, oh,
[3299.26s -> 3301.98s]  right here, right? It burnt up like right here. It can be, it can be anywhere.
[3303.34s -> 3313.74s]  It's near, it has to be near where it burned, right? It blew up right here.
[3315.29s -> 3327.13s]  Stop. Where is it? Look on the wall. Dude, I'm looking at the wall. I'm looking at the wall right
[3327.13s -> 3351.99s]  now. Sink. Please stop pretending. I have no idea what this wants me to do. I lifted up the thing.
[3351.99s -> 3360.22s]  It burnt. It exploded right here. And I'm so. Oh my fucking God. I thought this was a clock.
[3366.33s -> 3374.07s]  OK, so that's that's the sigil. So OK, now I have that. So let's go over here.
[3376.04s -> 3384.39s]  So what is now? What? What mark is that? This one here?
[3385.03s -> 3411.54s]  It's like, yeah, it's like the L. OK, so I have to get I got to get four of these.
[3411.62s -> 3419.91s]  Load it, hurry. OK, in invidious emulation, desolation.
[3422.15s -> 3430.98s]  OK, so we've got Baraketh. Who else has an L? T-Shack. I need I need more.
[3431.54s -> 3435.40s]  Let's go. Let's go light some more papers. All right.
[3435.40s -> 3438.20s]  All right. Let's light a paper and let's go find a something.
[3438.20s -> 3461.61s]  Let's go. I need more progress first. All right. Let's start.
[3462.33s -> 3469.67s]  All right. So I need to. All right. Enter markings into computer.
[3469.67s -> 3478.38s]  Didn't I already do that? Yeah, this is already submitted. I got I got to file it.
[3478.46s -> 3489.85s]  It's time to involve.
[3489.85s -> 3494.71s]  Why are you saying that that like it was a superpower you were activating?
[3494.71s -> 3503.26s]  Like that was weird. Time to embalm missing something.
[3503.26s -> 3510.12s]  All right. I need to do the. Where is all this shit?
[3510.12s -> 3513.32s]  OK, wire, needle injector and setting needles.
[3513.32s -> 3519.61s]  I don't know where all this stuff even is. Needle injector.
[3519.61s -> 3527.00s]  Are the lights off in here? No. All right. Where the needles?
[3527.00s -> 3535.91s]  It's not a tutorial anymore. Moisturizers here, right?
[3535.91s -> 3543.16s]  These needles. What the fuck is this? Oh, the glass cabinet. OK.
[3545.74s -> 3549.85s]  Needle injector. All right. Setting needles. Let's do it.
[3549.85s -> 3568.97s]  OK. Well, I got to be honest. What is the point of doing this?
[3568.97s -> 3572.49s]  What's the point of doing this? Why? Why? What's it for?
[3572.49s -> 3576.55s]  Why? Why do that? Why? Why are the person's jaw shut?
[3576.55s -> 3590.50s]  It keeps the mouth closed so they don't have their mouths open.
[3591.38s -> 3594.18s]  All right. I need eye caps. Why did you let me die?
[3594.18s -> 3614.60s]  What the fuck is this? This is all your fault.
[3614.60s -> 3622.97s]  At every second with you, time is running out, Rebecca.
[3635.85s -> 3639.69s]  OK. Insert eye caps. Where are the eye caps?
[3639.69s -> 3645.99s]  I don't really know. Eye caps. They weren't in here.
[3647.02s -> 3652.25s]  Scalpel. I'm going to pick it up just to have it. Little scissors.
[3654.42s -> 3665.82s]  Eye caps. Yeah. All right. Let's go. Put them on.
[3665.82s -> 3672.06s]  I can't use that here. Put them on.
[3672.06s -> 3678.28s]  You have to click the eyes. Oh, OK.
[3678.28s -> 3685.83s]  All right. Now we do the embalming fluid, which is all the chemicals.
[3686.95s -> 3696.06s]  This is humectant, hydrogen, whatever. No, no, no.
[3696.06s -> 3700.26s]  They don't put that in. I can't hold anything else.
[3700.26s -> 3717.85s]  God, why? OK. Formaldehyde.
[3718.81s -> 3729.61s]  The other stuff over here. One of those.
[3729.61s -> 3733.83s]  What? And then what's the last one?
[3734.63s -> 3743.99s]  Glutaraldehyde. OK. Where's the Glutaraldehyde?
[3752.49s -> 3763.45s]  Mix it up. Oh, wait. I need a reagent in the old cabinet.
[3763.45s -> 3776.26s]  OK. And now we're going to connect. Yep.
[3778.25s -> 3793.38s]  I'm missing something. I need the tube.
[3794.02s -> 3808.33s]  All right. Let's go. Turn it on.
[3808.33s -> 3846.46s]  Oh, hey, Satan. Where is it? Oh, Satan.
[3846.46s -> 3858.73s]  OK. That's like a big three right here. All right.
[3858.73s -> 3861.75s]  So we've got three L. What's three L?
[3865.90s -> 3869.10s]  L. Looking for L3. L3. L3. No.
[3872.97s -> 3880.39s]  L3. No. It's going to be emulation.
[3881.70s -> 3885.30s]  L3. L. Ah, it's. I know. I know their name.
[3885.30s -> 3887.54s]  I know your name. I know. I know. It's Anek.
[3887.54s -> 3890.98s]  It's Anek. Look right there. Anek.
[3890.98s -> 3893.34s]  All right. So what do I do? How do I say their name?
[3893.34s -> 3900.01s]  So now I know it's Anek. Oh, I have to put it in the thing.
[3900.01s -> 3907.61s]  OK. L3. T9. L3. T9.
[3909.56s -> 3910.68s]  Wait, it's going to be the right order.
[3913.29s -> 3921.72s]  It's L3. T9. L3. T9.
[3922.44s -> 3931.11s]  L3. T9. Like that, right?
[3931.11s -> 3959.11s]  L3. T9. Take it. Now what do I do with this?
[3959.11s -> 3962.55s]  Wait, attach it to body somehow, then burn it after?
[3962.55s -> 3966.15s]  You have to put it on the correct body, though.
[3966.15s -> 3973.21s]  Oh, OK. Why is this body possessed?
[3973.21s -> 3977.86s]  You're right. OK, I don't know, but I know it's that one.
[3977.86s -> 3981.99s]  All right. So now this is embalmed.
[3981.99s -> 3984.39s]  Fill an empty reservoir bag with cavity fluid. OK.
[3984.39s -> 3991.64s]  Hold anything else? Yes, you can.
[3992.20s -> 3996.98s]  Oh, my God, by this way. Put it back.
[4006.07s -> 4015.67s]  OK, then this goes in here. Start scribbling.
[4015.67s -> 4019.27s]  Where? Where do I write this down?
[4019.27s -> 4021.03s]  Where? Where? Where? Where? Write anything.
[4021.03s -> 4035.10s]  How do I write something down? On a desk?
[4035.10s -> 4054.86s]  That's nothing. I left a coffee mug on a piece of wood.
[4054.86s -> 4068.74s]  But that doesn't do anything. C. OK, keep this up.
[4069.30s -> 4093.99s]  There we go. OK, now mix cleaner in the bathroom.
[4093.99s -> 4106.46s]  I'm scared. Where's the bathroom? Right here, right?
[4106.46s -> 4120.30s]  Where's the bathroom? This is not the bathroom.
[4120.30s -> 4132.94s]  Where's the bathroom? Oh, it's right here.
[4132.94s -> 4154.49s]  OK, I got it. Any weird shit? Just a double check, right?
[4154.49s -> 4193.30s]  What was that? OK, apply moisturizer.
[4201.37s -> 4207.37s]  Right. Return body to cold storage.
[4207.37s -> 4230.78s]  OK, there's only two more bodies. What's that?
[4230.78s -> 4252.01s]  That's just a square. OK, let's go.
[4253.58s -> 4256.54s]  All right, who's next? All right, Cordell Armstrong.
[4256.54s -> 4263.14s]  Come on out. Let's go.
[4271.90s -> 4277.06s]  It starts with a C. It does start with a C, you're right.
[4277.06s -> 4294.84s]  That's true. OK, it's definitely this guy.
[4294.84s -> 4300.62s]  Without a doubt. It's 100% this guy.
[4300.62s -> 4326.78s]  This guy's smiling. Yeah, it's definitely this guy.
[4326.78s -> 4335.22s]  That hit? The head. OK, got it all.
[4335.22s -> 4347.10s]  All right, put it in the computer. Entry two.
[4347.10s -> 4351.98s]  This is Cordell Armstrong, age 53, head.
[4352.54s -> 4354.22s]  Got that thing on it. Right shoulder.
[4354.22s -> 4363.03s]  We've got these left arm, lemmishes, right arm, curatolas, right leg.
[4363.03s -> 4389.78s]  Got a mole. Submit. Hey, let's go.
[4389.78s -> 4397.43s]  OK, let's do it again. Oh, it's this guy.
[4397.43s -> 4403.66s]  It's this fucking guy. Look at this.
[4403.66s -> 4404.94s]  I'm going to put the thing in his mouth and he's.
[4417.78s -> 4423.51s]  There we go. OK, then it's eye caps.
[4423.51s -> 4429.43s]  Does it down here? What's after eye caps?
[4430.33s -> 4432.25s]  Embalming fluid. Let's just get this done now.
[4432.25s -> 4440.87s]  All right. OK, embalming fluid.
[4440.95s -> 4445.94s]  It's this shit, this shit.
[4450.14s -> 4457.16s]  And then it's this shit. And then it's this shit.
[4457.16s -> 4462.01s]  Where is it? That's turning into something else now.
[4464.60s -> 4471.16s]  Menthol. Where's menthol? Where's that menthol?
[4471.16s -> 4477.80s]  Where's that menthol? No, where is it?
[4477.80s -> 4482.30s]  I forget where it is. Over here?
[4482.30s -> 4490.39s]  Yep. OK, it's on the shelf. I remember that.
[4490.39s -> 4492.39s]  And the other chemical right here.
[4492.39s -> 4503.94s]  OK, now we're going to attach the tubing, which is here.
[4504.82s -> 4510.87s]  I need the stabbers, scalpel, or sips tubing.
[4510.87s -> 4521.66s]  That tube is over here. Isn't it?
[4521.66s -> 4532.34s]  Yeah. No, you're not.
[4532.34s -> 4534.38s]  You're fine. All right.
[4534.38s -> 4540.97s]  Turn it on. Quick scribble, scribble.
[4540.97s -> 4547.19s]  Input system error. Action acid cannot be found.
[4547.19s -> 4549.05s]  If you're experiencing this error for the first time,
[4549.05s -> 4553.18s]  locate a poisonous material, ingest and wait for heart rate to slow.
[4553.18s -> 4555.80s]  Your flesh is wasted. Give it to me.
[4555.80s -> 4559.40s]  Let me in. My glorious pleasures ache to flood your veins.
[4559.40s -> 4563.32s]  As you rot in torment for your sin, there is no hope, Rebecca.
[4563.32s -> 4564.76s]  You will see me, Rebecca.
[4564.76s -> 4573.46s]  It's a very odd Windows blue screen. OK.
[4575.35s -> 4582.65s]  Drink poison? Where's poison? I gotta drink it.
[4582.65s -> 4584.41s]  Where's poison? Drink poison quick.
[4601.51s -> 4603.59s]  Hey, what the fuck was that thing?
[4603.59s -> 4613.90s]  It's an Enderman. Where's poison?
[4630.57s -> 4642.82s]  What do I do? Wait, what's that?
[4642.82s -> 4667.93s]  Heroin kit. Wait, heroin? I'm going to do heroin?
[4667.93s -> 4674.38s]  Grab the keys. Nothing on this table is interactable.
[4674.38s -> 4688.98s]  No keys here. I just leave.
[4688.98s -> 4725.78s]  Oh, that's not good. Jesus.
[4725.78s -> 4726.74s]  Oh, yeah. Where are you?
[4738.90s -> 4741.40s]  Oh, yep. We got the right one.
[4741.40s -> 4743.00s]  Absolutely got the right one.
[4743.00s -> 4744.44s]  Yep. No way. It's not the right one.
[4744.44s -> 4752.50s]  It's anic. That's absolutely anic.
[4752.50s -> 4756.94s]  Yep. L3T9. We got it.
[4756.94s -> 4762.23s]  L3T9. That's it.
[4762.23s -> 4763.51s]  But is this the right person?
[4763.51s -> 4770.95s]  How can we tell if it's the right person, though?
[4770.95s -> 4773.19s]  If I put it on. Oh, what if I if I put it on?
[4773.19s -> 4783.53s]  Will it start to like burn? Wait, pump them.
[4783.53s -> 4798.31s]  You're right. OK. So what's that?
[4804.44s -> 4808.54s]  It's like a U. Is it a D or a G?
[4829.53s -> 4830.65s]  Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
[4832.57s -> 4835.16s]  OK. Turn. Remove the tubes.
[4835.16s -> 4835.88s]  Close the incision.
[4844.10s -> 4870.36s]  Now we need to do the reservoir bag with cavity fluid, which is over here.
[4870.36s -> 4884.73s]  Check the computer again. There we go.
[4885.37s -> 4894.60s]  OK. I'll check the computer.
[4894.60s -> 4898.36s]  OK. History. Identifying demonic tenacity.
[4898.36s -> 4903.82s]  Well, learning the name of the demonic entity is more about waiting.
[4903.82s -> 4907.48s]  Identifying which body is experiencing demonic tenacity
[4907.48s -> 4909.32s]  requires paying close attention.
[4909.32s -> 4911.70s]  While any of the bodies can be manipulated,
[4911.70s -> 4914.42s]  it is far easier for the entity to control its own vessel.
[4914.42s -> 4917.06s]  Sudden movements, large or small, can be a sign of tenacity.
[4919.66s -> 4923.74s]  If a body appears to be more active than others, a strange markings start to appear.
[4924.46s -> 4931.70s]  OK. The appearance of new markings on the body.
[4932.26s -> 4933.86s]  Sudden movements. Repeat movements.
[4938.55s -> 4939.51s]  Sudden movements.
[4944.46s -> 4949.91s]  This working? Yeah, this thing is huge.
[4950.55s -> 4956.22s]  I guess, um, this is David.
[4956.94s -> 4961.24s]  Raymond, this feels insane, but I think you were right.
[4961.88s -> 4966.36s]  This has happened a few times now, but let me see if I can get in here.
[4975.30s -> 4996.95s]  All right. Shut up. Shut up.
[5001.61s -> 5002.09s]  Whatever.
[5004.66s -> 5006.26s]  I'm going to burn this guy. I'm burning this guy.
[5006.26s -> 5008.52s]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[5008.52s -> 5010.68s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Circle. Circle.
[5019.98s -> 5022.65s]  You sure?
[5038.04s -> 5040.04s]  Well, this is dark in here. Right on.
[5041.08s -> 5059.02s]  All right. Clean the bathroom.
[5059.02s -> 5060.86s]  See? Oh, I mean, it's definitely see.
[5060.86s -> 5076.58s]  Oh, see, this is this guy named like corn something smiling.
[5076.58s -> 5104.41s]  It's definitely this guy missing something.
[5104.41s -> 5110.10s]  I'm putting this on his head. Is it not you?
[5110.10s -> 5114.71s]  When to be sure this is. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[5114.71s -> 5116.31s]  Yeah, 100 percent. Let's go.
[5116.31s -> 5118.31s]  You're going in the fucking toilet and wherever you're going.
[5119.53s -> 5122.25s]  I'm missing something. OK, it's this guy for real.
[5124.79s -> 5126.31s]  Well, we're going to moisturize the face.
[5128.89s -> 5130.65s]  Because that's we have to finish that right.
[5130.65s -> 5142.74s]  I can't use that here. All right.
[5147.56s -> 5149.40s]  What if it's don't trust yourself?
[5149.40s -> 5155.78s]  OK. All right. Back into the freezer.
[5171.18s -> 5173.26s]  Of course, it's this guy. It's this.
[5173.26s -> 5178.10s]  Are you serious? It's this guy.
[5178.10s -> 5179.54s]  It's this guy. I got to burn him.
[5179.54s -> 5180.90s]  How do I burn him? What do I do?
[5180.90s -> 5181.78s]  Do I have any holy water?
[5190.70s -> 5192.22s]  I thought there's the eyes looking at me.
[5192.22s -> 5196.06s]  Those are red eyes. Get over here.
[5196.62s -> 5199.48s]  I get. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5199.48s -> 5200.52s]  I got to put the thing on you.
[5203.22s -> 5204.26s]  I can't use that here.
[5204.26s -> 5205.86s]  Mark them. Mark them. Mark them quick.
[5206.50s -> 5208.58s]  How do I get them in here?
[5212.60s -> 5215.16s]  I can't move them. Why not?
[5258.94s -> 5264.73s]  Bye. See you later.
[5266.12s -> 5268.36s]  Annec. Your name is Annec.
[5268.36s -> 5269.80s]  Annec. Your name is Annec.
[5270.70s -> 5273.66s]  Back to the shadow demon realm with you.
[5273.66s -> 5276.22s]  Your name is Annec. Your name is Annec.
[5302.92s -> 5304.76s]  What? Why is he still alive?
[5305.32s -> 5316.07s]  I got him. No, I got him.
[5345.78s -> 5349.90s]  It doesn't end here from now on.
[5349.90s -> 5352.46s]  There is always a chance this will happen again.
[5352.46s -> 5354.87s]  No matter where you are.
[5354.87s -> 5357.69s]  I don't want this. I just want to leave.
[5357.69s -> 5359.53s]  By the way. Yes, it is.
[5359.53s -> 5361.13s]  It is eight dollars an hour.
[5370.87s -> 5374.23s]  So what? You're waging some selfless holy war.
[5374.23s -> 5377.53s]  It's not a war. It's survival.
[5377.53s -> 5379.43s]  And I'd hardly call it selfless.
[5380.76s -> 5383.32s]  We're caught at the front line of something larger.
[5383.32s -> 5385.24s]  But I don't do this for some greater good.
[5385.80s -> 5388.20s]  We either face it or fall to it.
[5390.41s -> 5392.33s]  I wish I could claim to be someone better.
[5393.05s -> 5395.21s]  Suffering hell to save us all.
[5395.21s -> 5399.35s]  But I simply want to live another day just like everyone else.
[5399.91s -> 5400.95s]  So did I win?
[5400.95s -> 5404.15s]  When I first experienced this, I had to make a choice.
[5405.30s -> 5408.26s]  I could run and spend the rest of my days in fear.
[5408.90s -> 5412.66s]  Or I could learn to face it and keep some semblance of a normal life.
[5413.30s -> 5413.94s]  That was pretty cool.
[5414.74s -> 5419.98s]  It's not a life I would want for anyone.
[5419.98s -> 5423.54s]  But choosing between a life of fear or control.
[5426.04s -> 5429.40s]  You're the first person I've met to face this hell and survive.
[5430.41s -> 5431.53s]  So there are five endings.
[5431.53s -> 5432.49s]  Different kind of job.
[5432.49s -> 5435.32s]  Let's go work the night shift.
[5435.96s -> 5437.80s]  Learn what I know.
[5437.80s -> 5442.89s]  Give yourself a chance at a life beyond fear.
[5442.89s -> 5447.69s]  I don't know what you experienced, but I know it uses the worst parts of you against yourself.
[5448.25s -> 5452.33s]  The more things happen, the more you'll confront the darkest parts of your life.
[5453.21s -> 5457.64s]  But through it, you'll become unbreakable.
[5457.64s -> 5459.80s]  I'm offering the tools to take control.
[5460.36s -> 5462.04s]  The choice is yours.
[5462.04s -> 5465.00s]  Hope you come back.
[5465.00s -> 5465.64s]  This game's cool.
[5468.62s -> 5473.56s]  It was not really what I was expecting, but it was kind of what I was expecting.
[5473.56s -> 5479.21s]  Time's possessed.
[5479.21s -> 5487.13s]  Wait, so that was when I was in the apartment?
[5487.13s -> 5487.85s]  Oh, okay.
[5487.85s -> 5488.81s]  That's cool.
[5488.81s -> 5492.28s]  Should I do one more?
[5492.28s -> 5494.63s]  I'll do one more.
[5494.63s -> 5500.94s]  Now that I understand how the game works, I'll try to do one a little cleaner.
[5500.94s -> 5502.70s]  And then I'll take off after this.
[5502.70s -> 5504.66s]  I'll be live tomorrow.
[5504.66s -> 5512.07s]  Tomorrow we're going to play Two Point Campus.
[5516.46s -> 5522.30s]  All right, let's go.
[5522.30s -> 5523.02s]  So I get it now.
[5523.02s -> 5523.98s]  I know how it works.
[5523.98s -> 5526.74s]  What time tomorrow?
[5527.30s -> 5529.78s]  Um, I'll probably be starting.
[5529.78s -> 5533.14s]  I want to say maybe two or three, maybe.
[5535.03s -> 5536.23s]  I'll put the steps what I want.
[5536.23s -> 5538.15s]  Maybe two o'clock, three o'clock.
[5538.15s -> 5543.02s]  All right, let's make this quicker.
[5543.82s -> 5561.08s]  Let's get to it.
[5561.08s -> 5561.80s]  Who do we got?
[5562.36s -> 5570.95s]  We have Brandy Cooper, Nick Darlington, and Rufus Harrell.
[5570.95s -> 5572.23s]  Let's do Rufus first.
[5572.95s -> 5574.34s]  When is baseball?
[5574.34s -> 5579.67s]  Baseball is August 19th at 6 30 p.m.
[5579.67s -> 5581.98s]  Oh, no, sorry.
[5582.90s -> 5584.66s]  At 4 30 p.m.
[5584.66s -> 5585.70s]  Yeah, sorry.
[5585.70s -> 5586.50s]  I had it wrong.
[5586.50s -> 5587.75s]  I don't know why I said six.
[5587.75s -> 5589.27s]  It's 4 30 p.m.
[5590.65s -> 5592.57s]  Not 6 30, 4 30.
[5592.57s -> 5599.66s]  What am I stuck on?
[5599.66s -> 5600.38s]  Get out of the way.
[5600.38s -> 5602.58s]  What am I stuck on?
[5602.58s -> 5606.50s]  Yeah, 4 30 p.m.
[5606.50s -> 5606.90s]  Pacific.
[5608.44s -> 5609.24s]  Why can't this not move?
[5609.24s -> 5610.68s]  I don't have my clipboard.
[5610.68s -> 5615.43s]  I have to go in backwards?
[5616.23s -> 5618.71s]  4 30 p.m.
[5618.71s -> 5619.19s]  Pacific.
[5625.02s -> 5625.82s]  All right, come on out.
[5626.46s -> 5629.98s]  Let's get lucky and have a B first try here.
[5629.98s -> 5661.70s]  All right, let's go.
[5661.70s -> 5663.48s]  What do you got?
[5663.48s -> 5667.29s]  I only need my clipboard.
[5667.29s -> 5670.65s]  At least I can keep track of things.
[5671.21s -> 5676.84s]  Am I laughing?
[5676.92s -> 5678.33s]  You heard it.
[5678.33s -> 5697.27s]  Somebody just came in.
[5697.27s -> 5707.14s]  Wait, this is scratch.
[5717.53s -> 5718.57s]  There we go.
[5718.57s -> 5724.09s]  All right.
[5724.09s -> 5726.94s]  This is Rufus 35.
[5727.58s -> 5729.38s]  Flemish's leg.
[5729.38s -> 5730.34s]  We got nothing.
[5730.34s -> 5730.90s]  Show right.
[5732.74s -> 5735.75s]  This right left shoulder.
[5735.75s -> 5737.51s]  Nothing left arm is a mole.
[5738.25s -> 5739.53s]  Right arm contusion.
[5739.53s -> 5741.53s]  Right leg abrasion.
[5741.53s -> 5758.41s]  Anything weird in here already?
[5758.41s -> 5773.67s]  All right, start it.
[5773.67s -> 5778.50s]  All right, we need the wiring.
[5778.50s -> 5781.77s]  I already forgot where all the tools are.
[5784.14s -> 5785.66s]  They're down here or something, right?
[5785.66s -> 5787.56s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5788.36s -> 5802.95s]  Is anybody eating to this stream?
[5802.95s -> 5807.83s]  I feel like it'd be hard.
[5807.83s -> 5808.39s]  There we go.
[5811.29s -> 5812.25s]  Eye caps.
[5812.25s -> 5817.59s]  I mean, actually, pizza would be pretty easy.
[5817.59s -> 5818.95s]  Yeah, I could do pizza.
[5818.95s -> 5828.42s]  You could eat pizza no matter what.
[5828.42s -> 5830.42s]  You can't get grossed out while you're eating pizza.
[5830.42s -> 5833.00s]  All right.
[5833.00s -> 5839.59s]  All right, we need all the embalming fluid now here.
[5843.58s -> 5844.94s]  You've used that one already.
[5844.94s -> 5846.84s]  That one sucks.
[5846.84s -> 5848.04s]  Start fires.
[5849.10s -> 5851.42s]  Start moving other shit besides knocking on the door.
[5851.42s -> 5853.82s]  What a shitty ghost.
[5853.82s -> 5856.01s]  What a terrible ghost.
[5856.01s -> 5857.37s]  Oh, I'm knocking on the door.
[5857.37s -> 5857.93s]  Yeah.
[5857.93s -> 5859.53s]  What amateur bullshit that is.
[5863.46s -> 5866.02s]  Start breaking glass and then we'll talk.
[5866.02s -> 5878.36s]  Oh, this one.
[5879.00s -> 5883.80s]  I need the notepad.
[5893.62s -> 5900.10s]  Notepad's in the other room.
[5900.10s -> 5900.82s]  It's him.
[5900.82s -> 5901.70s]  It's you.
[5901.70s -> 5902.74s]  It's you.
[5902.74s -> 5903.38s]  It's you.
[5903.38s -> 5907.59s]  I need my fucking notepad so I can write that shit down.
[5907.59s -> 5925.03s]  Where's the...
[5925.03s -> 5929.29s]  I always forget where this one is.
[5929.29s -> 5938.97s]  Over here.
[5938.97s -> 5939.61s]  Oh, shit.
[5956.42s -> 5958.98s]  Write something besides a scribble, dude.
[5963.56s -> 5965.48s]  You can't do anything else but that?
[5965.48s -> 5968.01s]  That was me in there.
[5968.01s -> 5968.65s]  That was fucked up.
[5968.65s -> 5970.04s]  All right.
[5970.04s -> 5973.77s]  All right, turn the machine on.
[5973.77s -> 5974.17s]  Oh, no.
[5974.17s -> 5976.25s]  I mean, I need the magical stuff.
[5981.59s -> 5981.83s]  Okay.
[5982.39s -> 5983.11s]  Put that away.
[5983.11s -> 5984.55s]  Let's go ahead and cut this.
[5984.55s -> 5985.82s]  I need the pipe.
[5985.82s -> 5989.05s]  I'm missing something.
[6008.06s -> 6008.70s]  Give me a note.
[6008.70s -> 6010.44s]  Give me a note.
[6010.44s -> 6011.72s]  Something in here, right?
[6011.72s -> 6012.44s]  Come on.
[6012.44s -> 6012.94s]  Yeah.
[6013.72s -> 6014.78s]  Where you at?
[6018.15s -> 6018.47s]  Okay.
[6018.47s -> 6018.95s]  It's a Z.
[6019.59s -> 6028.17s]  We need another one.
[6028.17s -> 6037.83s]  We can't go off of that one.
[6037.83s -> 6038.98s]  All right.
[6038.98s -> 6039.86s]  Get the tubes out.
[6046.41s -> 6053.18s]  You got another thing for me already?
[6053.18s -> 6054.46s]  Actually, it's Zed.
[6054.46s -> 6057.11s]  That's fine.
[6057.11s -> 6057.35s]  Okay.
[6057.35s -> 6059.11s]  Now we need to do the reservoir bag.
[6059.11s -> 6060.62s]  Is it over here?
[6066.63s -> 6069.19s]  And then that goes into the...
[6069.19s -> 6069.83s]  Oh, yeah.
[6069.83s -> 6070.79s]  This thing was here.
[6070.79s -> 6093.38s]  You got something to say?
[6098.55s -> 6098.87s]  All right.
[6098.87s -> 6099.27s]  Where is it?
[6100.89s -> 6101.13s]  Z?
[6104.68s -> 6105.56s]  A bird?
[6105.56s -> 6106.20s]  It looks like a bird.
[6106.20s -> 6117.69s]  Let's take a look.
[6117.69s -> 6118.33s]  Oh, come on.
[6118.33s -> 6119.13s]  What's the password?
[6125.38s -> 6127.14s]  9187.
[6127.14s -> 6135.19s]  Okay.
[6136.76s -> 6137.24s]  It's...
[6137.24s -> 6137.56s]  What was it?
[6137.56s -> 6138.36s]  What were the two symbols?
[6138.36s -> 6138.86s]  Bird and...
[6141.05s -> 6142.41s]  Bird and Z.
[6142.41s -> 6142.89s]  All right.
[6142.89s -> 6143.29s]  It could be...
[6144.01s -> 6146.78s]  Baldmet.
[6146.78s -> 6147.34s]  Wait.
[6147.34s -> 6155.58s]  Is that the right one?
[6155.58s -> 6160.57s]  The wrong Z?
[6160.57s -> 6161.45s]  Could be...
[6161.45s -> 6162.95s]  Shadat?
[6162.95s -> 6164.23s]  That's the right one, right?
[6164.23s -> 6165.03s]  Bird and Z.
[6166.12s -> 6166.60s]  Okay.
[6166.60s -> 6167.40s]  Shadat?
[6167.40s -> 6173.05s]  I think it's that one.
[6173.05s -> 6175.67s]  Let's check the other ones.
[6175.67s -> 6188.25s]  Shadat?
[6188.25s -> 6190.01s]  Yep.
[6190.01s -> 6190.89s]  Shadat.
[6190.89s -> 6192.07s]  This one here.
[6192.07s -> 6192.79s]  NVIDIUS.
[6192.79s -> 6193.59s]  Shadat.
[6193.59s -> 6195.90s]  We just got to confirm that with a three
[6195.90s -> 6197.82s]  and another little symbol here.
[6197.82s -> 6199.13s]  So wait.
[6199.13s -> 6199.77s]  Let me get this right.
[6199.77s -> 6212.09s]  So there's bird, Z on the left.
[6212.09s -> 6212.73s]  Okay.
[6212.73s -> 6217.61s]  All right.
[6217.61s -> 6218.01s]  Something happened.
[6218.01s -> 6218.65s]  Something happened here.
[6219.53s -> 6223.61s]  What's left?
[6223.61s -> 6224.17s]  I have to...
[6224.17s -> 6225.45s]  Oh, yeah.
[6226.09s -> 6226.41s]  This thing.
[6226.41s -> 6231.82s]  I was doing this.
[6231.82s -> 6231.98s]  C.
[6232.62s -> 6239.82s]  There we go.
[6241.38s -> 6241.70s]  Okay.
[6241.70s -> 6243.38s]  Then mix the cleaners in the bathroom
[6243.38s -> 6244.66s]  and then do the face moisturizer.
[6244.90s -> 6275.54s]  Can we move?
[6275.54s -> 6279.62s]  I can't use that here.
[6279.62s -> 6286.09s]  Why not?
[6286.09s -> 6286.89s]  Hurry up.
[6286.89s -> 6293.88s]  All right.
[6293.88s -> 6302.97s]  Let's go.
[6302.97s -> 6303.61s]  I can't make it.
[6303.61s -> 6304.01s]  I can't.
[6304.01s -> 6304.65s]  I don't know.
[6304.65s -> 6305.21s]  It could be...
[6305.21s -> 6305.69s]  It could be.
[6308.89s -> 6310.41s]  He was looking at himself though.
[6310.41s -> 6311.45s]  His eyes just opened.
[6311.45s -> 6313.40s]  His eyes are just...
[6313.40s -> 6314.94s]  His eyes are opened.
[6314.94s -> 6315.10s]  Wait.
[6315.10s -> 6315.74s]  Did they?
[6315.74s -> 6329.78s]  His eyes opened.
[6329.78s -> 6330.74s]  This is Rufus.
[6339.85s -> 6340.09s]  It's...
[6340.09s -> 6340.33s]  Yeah.
[6340.33s -> 6341.45s]  It's definitely this guy.
[6343.99s -> 6344.63s]  Well, let's...
[6344.63s -> 6345.35s]  We'll confirm it.
[6347.94s -> 6361.91s]  He's got scratches, man.
[6361.91s -> 6363.11s]  It's definitely this guy.
[6363.11s -> 6363.51s]  I'm just gonna...
[6363.51s -> 6364.55s]  I think I'm just gonna go for it.
[6373.03s -> 6373.99s]  I'll try one more person.
[6374.63s -> 6375.27s]  But I really...
[6375.27s -> 6376.39s]  I actually think it really is him.
[6388.92s -> 6389.40s]  Is it you?
[6391.56s -> 6392.04s]  Brandy?
[6392.60s -> 6433.21s]  She's waiting and looking for movements.
[6437.14s -> 6437.46s]  Hey.
[6437.46s -> 6439.46s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[6439.46s -> 6439.78s]  Easy.
[6440.76s -> 6441.48s]  Easy.
[6441.48s -> 6455.48s]  What's your problem?
[6455.48s -> 6456.12s]  Stop.
[6456.12s -> 6472.14s]  What's your...
[6472.14s -> 6473.18s]  There we go.
[6473.18s -> 6474.06s]  That's it, huh?
[6474.06s -> 6475.05s]  Okay.
[6475.05s -> 6475.85s]  Let's get it in the computer.
[6485.11s -> 6486.39s]  Brash on the head.
[6486.39s -> 6490.55s]  That's it.
[6491.51s -> 6492.07s]  All right.
[6492.07s -> 6502.66s]  How come your face is a different color than your body?
[6505.61s -> 6507.13s]  A combination of bad lighting,
[6507.13s -> 6510.07s]  a bunch of blood in my face,
[6510.07s -> 6515.50s]  and I don't know.
[6516.23s -> 6517.19s]  Weird lighting.
[6517.19s -> 6518.63s]  And the white balance is fucked up.
[6518.63s -> 6526.31s]  I'm playing a scary game.
[6526.31s -> 6526.95s]  What are you talking about?
[6526.95s -> 6527.91s]  It's intense.
[6527.91s -> 6532.10s]  My face is full of blood and fluids.
[6532.10s -> 6532.34s]  All right.
[6532.34s -> 6547.14s]  Let's start it.
[6547.14s -> 6548.74s]  There we go.
[6548.74s -> 6549.62s]  Eyecaps.
[6549.62s -> 6561.38s]  All right.
[6562.66s -> 6565.22s]  Now we do this stuff in the neck.
[6565.22s -> 6582.76s]  Okay.
[6582.76s -> 6584.04s]  And the last one is right here.
[6585.48s -> 6586.68s]  What the fuck was that?
[6601.64s -> 6605.91s]  I'm gonna be able to get out of here.
[6605.91s -> 6611.27s]  No, nothing.
[6611.27s -> 6611.59s]  Okay.
[6611.59s -> 6611.99s]  Keep going.
[6611.99s -> 6613.78s]  Keep going.
[6613.78s -> 6615.46s]  I really do think it's the first guy, though.
[6615.46s -> 6620.18s]  I need tubing.
[6620.18s -> 6621.14s]  Oh, shit.
[6621.14s -> 6622.78s]  Oh, my goodness.
[6622.86s -> 6623.18s]  Okay.
[6623.18s -> 6624.46s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[6624.46s -> 6625.26s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[6625.26s -> 6629.90s]  That's different now.
[6629.90s -> 6630.62s]  That's a circle.
[6630.62s -> 6633.53s]  Oh, oh, oh.
[6633.53s -> 6637.80s]  Can't hold anything up.
[6638.68s -> 6639.40s]  Oh, please.
[6639.40s -> 6647.14s]  Take the tube.
[6655.96s -> 6656.60s]  Okay.
[6656.60s -> 6659.69s]  I can't make an incision.
[6659.69s -> 6660.17s]  I need this.
[6660.17s -> 6661.21s]  Oh, I need a scalpel.
[6661.21s -> 6669.29s]  Scalpel.
[6669.29s -> 6669.93s]  Let's go.
[6669.93s -> 6672.36s]  I can't use that here.
[6672.36s -> 6676.02s]  What's going on?
[6676.02s -> 6677.14s]  Did I not put this in?
[6677.14s -> 6678.10s]  I can't hold anything else.
[6678.10s -> 6679.54s]  I didn't put the menthol in?
[6679.54s -> 6685.13s]  God damn it.
[6685.13s -> 6685.61s]  Okay.
[6685.61s -> 6690.26s]  I'm missing something.
[6690.98s -> 6697.40s]  All right.
[6697.40s -> 6697.80s]  Let's go.
[6699.05s -> 6700.09s]  I can't use that here.
[6702.55s -> 6702.87s]  Begin.
[6740.01s -> 6743.75s]  That felt weird when I walked in the room.
[6744.71s -> 6747.06s]  Do you know what I mean?
[6747.06s -> 6749.30s]  Like something about I felt weird.
[6749.30s -> 6751.86s]  I felt off walking in here.
[6751.86s -> 6753.40s]  I don't know why I just did.
[6753.40s -> 6754.04s]  I told you.
[6754.04s -> 6755.08s]  What did I fucking told you?
[6755.08s -> 6756.12s]  Something was weird.
[6756.12s -> 6756.84s]  I told you so.
[6756.84s -> 6758.52s]  I got bad vibes when I opened the door.
[6759.16s -> 6760.25s]  I could feel it.
[6766.57s -> 6767.13s]  Jesus.
[6768.71s -> 6769.11s]  Okay.
[6770.01s -> 6781.11s]  Um, now we've got to do the wait.
[6781.11s -> 6790.31s]  Let me check this.
[6790.31s -> 6790.87s]  All right.
[6790.87s -> 6794.22s]  We got to, um, okay.
[6794.22s -> 6795.90s]  The abdominal cavity and clean the bathroom.
[6822.36s -> 6823.00s]  Write it down.
[6823.00s -> 6823.56s]  Write it down.
[6823.56s -> 6826.12s]  If you could.
[6826.12s -> 6827.24s]  Holy shit.
[6851.50s -> 6852.79s]  44.
[6852.79s -> 6854.15s]  Estimated 44.
[6854.15s -> 6868.52s]  If S 44, S 44, S 40, S 44.
[6868.52s -> 6871.51s]  I can't hold anything else.
[6871.51s -> 6878.78s]  I can't use that here.
[6878.78s -> 6879.34s]  Why not?
[6879.34s -> 6902.07s]  I can't hold anything else.
[6902.07s -> 6903.43s]  Oh, goodness.
[6903.43s -> 6919.10s]  Where is it?
[6919.10s -> 6919.90s]  Where is it?
[6922.49s -> 6923.53s]  Excuse me.
[6923.53s -> 6923.85s]  Where?
[6924.57s -> 6929.19s]  That's who it is.
[6929.19s -> 6929.74s]  All right.
[6929.74s -> 6930.30s]  I know it.
[6930.30s -> 6932.55s]  Let's get it on there.
[6932.55s -> 6938.42s]  Should that it's down and then bird Z down three.
[6946.70s -> 6947.50s]  Like that, right?
[6947.50s -> 6949.54s]  I can't hold anything else.
[6949.54s -> 6952.01s]  Okay.
[6952.01s -> 6952.89s]  I want to put it on you.
[6952.89s -> 6953.77s]  What do you do?
[6953.77s -> 6957.98s]  I'm going to drop this shit.
[6957.98s -> 6967.16s]  I'm missing something.
[6967.16s -> 6968.28s]  What are you talking about?
[6968.28s -> 6970.20s]  Give me the.
[6971.08s -> 6972.60s]  I already, I already have one of those.
[6973.53s -> 6973.77s]  What?
[6974.81s -> 6976.09s]  Oh my God.
[6976.09s -> 6977.13s]  Fuck that guy.
[6977.77s -> 6979.77s]  That was fucking horrible.
[6979.77s -> 6980.89s]  Holy shit.
[6982.54s -> 6983.58s]  Oh my God.
[6983.58s -> 6985.02s]  That was awful.
[6985.02s -> 6987.77s]  It was awful.
[6987.77s -> 6988.25s]  Write it down.
[6992.49s -> 6993.29s]  Jesus.
[7007.74s -> 7008.38s]  Okay.
[7008.38s -> 7011.22s]  I know who it is, but I don't think it's her.
[7011.22s -> 7012.10s]  I think it's the guy.
[7018.09s -> 7022.60s]  There we go.
[7022.60s -> 7023.69s]  Okay.
[7023.69s -> 7024.89s]  Cleaner from the bathroom.
[7024.89s -> 7025.29s]  I got to.
[7025.29s -> 7026.17s]  Are you serious?
[7026.17s -> 7027.96s]  Can I just pour it in?
[7027.96s -> 7028.44s]  Who cares?
[7034.49s -> 7037.10s]  It's it's should that it's should that.
[7037.66s -> 7038.06s]  Okay.
[7038.92s -> 7039.80s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[7039.80s -> 7041.64s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7046.58s -> 7046.98s]  Okay.
[7046.98s -> 7047.38s]  All right.
[7047.38s -> 7047.70s]  All right.
[7047.70s -> 7048.02s]  All right.
[7048.02s -> 7048.58s]  Give me the thing.
[7049.22s -> 7052.84s]  If I put this on you, what do you do?
[7058.79s -> 7061.11s]  Are you sure this is the right?
[7061.11s -> 7063.13s]  Yep.
[7063.13s -> 7064.49s]  Oh, yes, I am.
[7064.49s -> 7074.89s]  I'm missing something.
[7074.89s -> 7092.31s]  I actually don't know.
[7092.31s -> 7092.71s]  Okay.
[7092.71s -> 7093.03s]  All right.
[7093.03s -> 7093.67s]  Moisture.
[7093.67s -> 7094.71s]  I've got places to be.
[7094.71s -> 7095.27s]  Let's go.
[7095.27s -> 7096.86s]  Hurry up.
[7096.86s -> 7099.24s]  Moisturize.
[7099.24s -> 7106.81s]  All right.
[7106.81s -> 7107.21s]  Let's go.
[7107.69s -> 7115.27s]  I think it's the first guy.
[7120.87s -> 7121.27s]  You know what?
[7121.27s -> 7123.51s]  I'm going to take the third person out and put this on them.
[7123.51s -> 7147.78s]  Hey, it's you.
[7148.34s -> 7149.19s]  I think.
[7149.19s -> 7150.07s]  Get over here.
[7150.07s -> 7153.90s]  You know what?
[7153.90s -> 7155.02s]  Just stay right here for a second.
[7155.58s -> 7192.78s]  I can't use that here.
[7232.41s -> 7254.68s]  He's got scratches.
[7254.68s -> 7256.70s]  Move him.
[7256.70s -> 7257.26s]  There we go.
[7257.90s -> 7266.07s]  Stop.
[7266.07s -> 7266.87s]  I want to go back.
[7278.12s -> 7278.84s]  No.
[7278.84s -> 7279.32s]  Left leg.
[7280.82s -> 7281.78s]  Left arm.
[7281.78s -> 7282.66s]  That's it.
[7283.54s -> 7290.54s]  Where's my thing?
[7290.54s -> 7291.26s]  Where's my thing that I?
[7291.26s -> 7291.42s]  Okay.
[7291.42s -> 7292.46s]  It's on it right here.
[7292.46s -> 7294.09s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[7294.09s -> 7295.53s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7295.53s -> 7296.33s]  I can't hold any.
[7296.33s -> 7297.69s]  I can't hold anything else.
[7297.85s -> 7299.29s]  Stupid thing back then.
[7299.29s -> 7308.52s]  Everyone's saying, hey, calm down, calm down.
[7308.52s -> 7311.24s]  I mean, I don't have to go fast because I'm going to get possessed
[7311.24s -> 7313.32s]  and I'm losing my mind, right?
[7313.32s -> 7352.18s]  The fuck?
[7352.18s -> 7353.06s]  There we go.
[7353.06s -> 7355.21s]  Okay.
[7355.83s -> 7364.63s]  Eye caps.
[7364.63s -> 7365.43s]  All right.
[7365.43s -> 7367.16s]  Mix the fluid.
[7373.18s -> 7373.74s]  Don't.
[7373.74s -> 7376.06s]  I know there's something probably going to be in here in a second.
[7376.06s -> 7376.46s]  Come on.
[7379.72s -> 7381.00s]  You know, close this door.
[7381.00s -> 7381.56s]  Close the door.
[7381.56s -> 7382.60s]  I don't want anyone to see me in here.
[7382.60s -> 7383.16s]  Close this door.
[7383.16s -> 7383.88s]  Thank you.
[7383.88s -> 7387.96s]  All right.
[7387.96s -> 7394.54s]  Let's fill it up.
[7394.54s -> 7394.94s]  Okay.
[7394.94s -> 7397.34s]  Now it's the incision with scalpel forceps.
[7397.34s -> 7397.84s]  Joy.
[7399.98s -> 7404.31s]  And then I need the tube.
[7404.31s -> 7445.08s]  What is that?
[7445.08s -> 7445.72s]  Oh, shit.
[7445.72s -> 7446.04s]  It's going to.
[7446.04s -> 7447.16s]  Does that say going to say 44?
[7475.11s -> 7475.67s]  Say something.
[7475.67s -> 7476.63s]  I'm missing something.
[7479.83s -> 7480.63s]  Shit.
[7480.63s -> 7482.46s]  23.
[7484.87s -> 7488.17s]  Does he have new scratches?
[7488.17s -> 7488.67s]  Does he?
[7495.08s -> 7506.68s]  Where?
[7506.68s -> 7508.36s]  It's the first guy.
[7508.36s -> 7509.16s]  It's the first guy.
[7509.16s -> 7509.48s]  Yeah.
[7509.48s -> 7509.80s]  Fuck it.
[7509.80s -> 7510.44s]  I'm not spinning.
[7510.44s -> 7511.08s]  I'm not waiting.
[7511.08s -> 7511.72s]  It's the first guy.
[7511.72s -> 7512.60s]  It's the first guy.
[7512.60s -> 7514.62s]  Without a doubt.
[7514.62s -> 7515.90s]  Without a doubt in my mind.
[7515.90s -> 7516.86s]  I'm missing something.
[7516.86s -> 7517.50s]  It's the guy out here.
[7517.50s -> 7518.30s]  It's the first guy.
[7518.30s -> 7522.82s]  Get him off this thing.
[7523.54s -> 7526.86s]  I think I have to finish it.
[7526.86s -> 7527.74s]  Yeah, I do, don't I?
[7528.30s -> 7528.70s]  I can't.
[7528.70s -> 7532.39s]  I can't hold anything else.
[7552.18s -> 7554.02s]  Don't you love your grandma?
[7554.02s -> 7561.94s]  It's so cold out here.
[7562.82s -> 7564.02s]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[7564.02s -> 7591.19s]  Get the fuck out of here, you bitch.
[7591.19s -> 7592.07s]  Grandma.
[7592.07s -> 7592.79s]  My goodness.
[7594.97s -> 7596.17s]  Watch your language.
[7600.02s -> 7600.42s]  All right.
[7600.42s -> 7601.54s]  Finish it, please.
[7601.54s -> 7602.66s]  Before I get in.
[7602.66s -> 7602.98s]  Okay.
[7602.98s -> 7603.30s]  Hold on.
[7603.30s -> 7603.94s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7603.94s -> 7604.90s]  I'm missing something.
[7604.90s -> 7606.10s]  I got to finish this.
[7606.10s -> 7606.90s]  That's the first guy.
[7606.90s -> 7611.02s]  I'm missing something.
[7611.02s -> 7611.74s]  Give me the bag.
[7612.30s -> 7613.26s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[7613.26s -> 7613.66s]  Where is it?
[7613.66s -> 7613.98s]  Right here.
[7638.62s -> 7639.18s]  Let me in.
[7639.98s -> 7644.79s]  There we go.
[7644.79s -> 7645.03s]  All right.
[7645.03s -> 7645.67s]  You're done.
[7645.67s -> 7646.15s]  You're done.
[7646.15s -> 7646.63s]  You're done.
[7646.63s -> 7647.19s]  You're done.
[7647.19s -> 7648.23s]  Clean the bathroom.
[7648.23s -> 7657.75s]  There's no more cleaner.
[7657.75s -> 7662.95s]  There's no more cleaner.
[7662.95s -> 7663.75s]  What do I do?
[7663.75s -> 7673.80s]  I dropped it somewhere.
[7673.80s -> 7674.68s]  Oh, fuck.
[7674.68s -> 7675.16s]  Come on.
[7675.16s -> 7676.12s]  Don't do this to me now.
[7676.12s -> 7676.84s]  Where is it?
[7676.84s -> 7684.94s]  Where did I drop it?
[7684.94s -> 7689.24s]  There are more than one shelf.
[7689.24s -> 7729.88s]  Why is it quiet?
[7729.88s -> 7730.20s]  What?
[7751.29s -> 7751.79s]  Hey.
[7759.99s -> 7760.95s]  I'm not.
[7760.95s -> 7763.77s]  I'm still kind of alive here.
[7763.77s -> 7765.72s]  All right.
[7765.72s -> 7766.20s]  What did I do?
[7766.20s -> 7767.00s]  It was heroin, right?
[7767.00s -> 7813.45s]  What the fuck do I do?
[7813.45s -> 7824.01s]  No, don't look at that.
[7824.01s -> 7825.05s]  Get tubing by.
[7826.17s -> 7827.96s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[7827.96s -> 7829.16s]  I just have so locked in.
[7829.16s -> 7829.48s]  All right.
[7829.48s -> 7832.63s]  Get tubing, needle, and lighter.
[7832.63s -> 7833.83s]  Tubing by the bed.
[7833.83s -> 7839.48s]  Tubing, needle, and lighter.
[7839.48s -> 7841.37s]  Tubing.
[7841.37s -> 7846.09s]  Where's the needle?
[7846.09s -> 7848.82s]  Needle, bathroom, spoon from the coffee table.
[7848.82s -> 7854.65s]  That's not it.
[7854.65s -> 7858.06s]  That's the spoon, right?
[7858.06s -> 7868.84s]  I don't get it.
[7868.84s -> 7869.96s]  Needle from the bathroom.
[7869.96s -> 7878.65s]  I can't see a needle.
[7878.65s -> 7884.15s]  Needle.
[7884.15s -> 7884.79s]  Where?
[7884.79s -> 7889.91s]  Find a lighter.
[7889.91s -> 7891.72s]  Find a full baggie.
[7891.72s -> 7902.68s]  Encounter.
[7902.68s -> 7903.32s]  Lighter.
[7903.32s -> 7905.80s]  Spoon from the coffee table.
[7906.70s -> 7908.81s]  Dude, the spoon is right there.
[7908.81s -> 7909.69s]  I can't click it.
[7909.69s -> 7919.72s]  That's the spoon right here.
[7919.72s -> 7920.60s]  In order?
[7920.60s -> 7922.60s]  Why does it be in order?
[7922.60s -> 7925.72s]  Find a lighter.
[7925.72s -> 7940.31s]  You see a lighter?
[7940.31s -> 7941.03s]  Lighter.
[7941.03s -> 7946.36s]  You looked in the same two spots.
[7946.36s -> 7946.84s]  I mean, look.
[7946.84s -> 7948.36s]  It's dark as shit in here.
[7948.36s -> 7949.96s]  I can't see anything.
[7949.96s -> 7951.03s]  What are you talking?
[7951.03s -> 7952.79s]  I can't see a goddamn thing.
[7952.79s -> 7961.56s]  It's right there.
[7961.56s -> 7990.58s]  It's dark.
[7990.58s -> 8004.04s]  What the fuck?
[8004.04s -> 8004.84s]  Close the door.
[8004.84s -> 8006.04s]  Close the door.
[8006.04s -> 8009.27s]  Sound like a laugh track?
[8009.27s -> 8010.63s]  No, it didn't, dude.
[8010.63s -> 8019.77s]  That does not sound like a laugh track.
[8019.77s -> 8024.63s]  All right.
[8024.63s -> 8029.21s]  I got to get this motherfucker out of here.
[8029.21s -> 8029.93s]  Moisturizer.
[8029.93s -> 8031.37s]  And then it's the first guy.
[8031.37s -> 8037.40s]  It's the first one.
[8037.40s -> 8039.05s]  Oh, goodness.
[8039.05s -> 8041.38s]  It's here.
[8041.38s -> 8041.86s]  It's here.
[8041.86s -> 8042.58s]  It's here.
[8042.58s -> 8043.56s]  It's here.
[8043.56s -> 8043.80s]  Wait.
[8043.80s -> 8045.48s]  There are new scratches on this person.
[8045.48s -> 8047.75s]  Scratches, scratches, scratches.
[8047.75s -> 8047.99s]  Right there.
[8047.99s -> 8050.97s]  Were they there before?
[8050.97s -> 8051.93s]  I don't think they were.
[8051.93s -> 8057.46s]  All right.
[8057.46s -> 8058.74s]  Let's moisturize their face.
[8058.74s -> 8062.38s]  All right.
[8062.38s -> 8063.10s]  OK.
[8063.10s -> 8066.63s]  Which one of you idiots is it?
[8066.63s -> 8069.80s]  It's the first one.
[8078.73s -> 8079.61s]  Yeah, no doubt.
[8079.61s -> 8080.33s]  It's the first one.
[8080.33s -> 8081.29s]  It's the first one.
[8081.29s -> 8082.25s]  You know, you can just stay here.
[8082.25s -> 8082.81s]  I don't even care.
[8082.81s -> 8083.61s]  Wait, I need the gurney.
[8083.61s -> 8123.83s]  Are you sure this is the first one?
[8124.07s -> 8125.59s]  Shit, it was this guy.
[8125.59s -> 8127.59s]  I was like trying to clean up the place.
[8127.59s -> 8129.03s]  I was trying to clean it up.
[8129.03s -> 8140.28s]  How is this guy out?
[8140.28s -> 8141.32s]  This is weird.
[8141.32s -> 8141.88s]  It's this guy.
[8141.88s -> 8143.08s]  Look at how fucking weird that is.
[8189.83s -> 8190.15s]  Yes.
[8202.26s -> 8202.74s]  Gotcha.
[8211.02s -> 8211.90s]  Gotcha.
[8211.90s -> 8229.14s]  Is it the same ending?
[8229.14s -> 8230.66s]  Same ending.
[8230.66s -> 8232.66s]  So how do I get it to be a different ending?
[8232.66s -> 8233.38s]  Come a long way.
[8233.38s -> 8237.22s]  It's nice not to be the...
[8237.22s -> 8237.86s]  No, this is different.
[8238.71s -> 8240.78s]  Mr. Dover?
[8240.78s -> 8241.34s]  Oh, no.
[8241.34s -> 8244.54s]  I think you can just call me Raymond at this point.
[8244.54s -> 8247.42s]  Do you always just pass out and wake up on the floor?
[8249.14s -> 8250.90s]  It takes a lot out of you.
[8250.90s -> 8255.37s]  I've never simply walked out of here after.
[8255.37s -> 8256.25s]  You get used to it.
[8258.14s -> 8259.90s]  I'll be sure to clean the floors better.
[8261.80s -> 8264.28s]  Raymond, will this ever end?
[8266.22s -> 8267.34s]  I honestly don't know.
[8267.98s -> 8271.05s]  I've been doing this a long time, Rebecca.
[8271.05s -> 8274.89s]  I've traveled all over, learning everything I can.
[8276.73s -> 8279.29s]  I've never found anything that could put a stop to it.
[8279.29s -> 8280.73s]  You've got to iron that shirt, bro.
[8280.73s -> 8283.21s]  So no, I don't think it does.
[8284.01s -> 8286.97s]  So we're just like this forever?
[8287.91s -> 8289.03s]  It was hard for me, too.
[8290.42s -> 8291.70s]  But this is the life we get.
[8293.03s -> 8296.31s]  We have to face our worst selves constantly.
[8297.75s -> 8299.83s]  Stand around until you die in the next one?
[8299.83s -> 8300.39s]  Let's try that.
[8300.39s -> 8301.03s]  We are.
[8301.03s -> 8305.88s]  Why don't you head home?
[8305.88s -> 8306.76s]  Get some rest.
[8306.76s -> 8308.20s]  Just die?
[8308.20s -> 8309.56s]  Who knows what's coming tonight?
[8309.56s -> 8317.77s]  Do another one and burn the first guy?
[8317.77s -> 8318.09s]  I already...
[8318.09s -> 8321.37s]  I did that already.
[8321.37s -> 8325.91s]  No, that's a different ending.
[8325.91s -> 8326.55s]  I burnt the...
[8327.19s -> 8334.01s]  Remember, I just picked somebody up and burnt them?
[8334.01s -> 8335.67s]  So how do I get...
[8335.67s -> 8336.79s]  You're just saying just don't do anything.
[8336.79s -> 8337.59s]  Just stand still.
[8337.59s -> 8353.11s]  Just let this sigil form and get possessed.
[8353.11s -> 8354.39s]  I'll do a possessed ending.
[8356.95s -> 8357.75s]  Death and decay.
[8364.76s -> 8365.96s]  Don't leave the apartment.
[8391.48s -> 8392.36s]  Embalm.
[8392.36s -> 8397.19s]  Look about the history of preservation.
[8397.19s -> 8397.99s]  Oh, shit.
[8397.99s -> 8399.72s]  It's grandma.
[8399.72s -> 8427.38s]  Nothing in there.
[8427.38s -> 8427.70s]  Nothing.
[8435.67s -> 8441.29s]  Check under the TV.
[8445.80s -> 8446.60s]  Under the TV?
[8456.06s -> 8456.62s]  Try to cook.
[8457.51s -> 8457.99s]  I don't have any...
[8457.99s -> 8459.03s]  Do I have any food?
[8459.03s -> 8477.42s]  Do heroin.
[8477.42s -> 8477.98s]  No.
[8477.98s -> 8503.82s]  Nothing in here.
[8503.82s -> 8504.30s]  Oh, no.
[8504.30s -> 8509.86s]  I just yawed.
[8509.86s -> 8510.58s]  Oh, what's this?
[8511.30s -> 8512.26s]  My dad's necklace.
[8512.90s -> 8515.38s]  Love you, dad.
[8515.38s -> 8516.58s]  My sobriety coin?
[8519.32s -> 8521.32s]  My dad's sobriety coin.
[8521.32s -> 8524.54s]  Okay.
[8524.54s -> 8526.22s]  So I have these items?
[8526.22s -> 8530.36s]  Okay.
[8530.36s -> 8535.35s]  Should I go now?
[8535.35s -> 8552.73s]  Where are my keys?
[8552.73s -> 8553.21s]  All right.
[8553.21s -> 8555.18s]  It's getting kind of late.
[8558.26s -> 8559.18s]  What do you think?
[8559.18s -> 8559.58s]  One more...
[8560.14s -> 8561.26s]  Just try to lose.
[8561.26s -> 8562.74s]  Just get scared.
[8562.74s -> 8573.08s]  All right.
[8573.08s -> 8576.70s]  Let's just do everything wrong.
[8576.70s -> 8584.70s]  Get the body out but do the name wrong.
[8584.70s -> 8585.34s]  All right.
[8585.34s -> 8586.62s]  Timothy Sharp.
[8586.70s -> 8594.09s]  Just do everything wrong.
[8594.09s -> 8594.73s]  Okay.
[8594.73s -> 8616.68s]  Am I doing that or is he doing that?
[8621.54s -> 8622.50s]  Get the secret ending?
[8623.06s -> 8653.58s]  Do everything right with the coins
[8653.58s -> 8654.46s]  and get the secret ending.
[8656.98s -> 8663.24s]  Wait, this is my work badge.
[8663.24s -> 8669.58s]  Wait, what?
[8669.58s -> 8672.30s]  Oh, I'm like an actual employee now.
[8672.30s -> 8678.89s]  I don't need a password anymore.
[8678.89s -> 8699.48s]  Oh, no.
[8699.48s -> 8700.92s]  Why am I so tired?
[8700.92s -> 8701.80s]  Scare me.
[8701.80s -> 8703.86s]  Scream at me or something.
[8703.86s -> 8717.08s]  This dude thought he could handle
[8717.08s -> 8718.12s]  the McDonald's order.
[8732.12s -> 8732.92s]  That's it.
[8732.92s -> 8743.42s]  All right.
[8743.42s -> 8744.22s]  Left leg.
[8744.22s -> 8744.78s]  Yep.
[8744.78s -> 8745.90s]  Right shoulder.
[8745.90s -> 8746.62s]  Yep.
[8746.62s -> 8747.34s]  Left shoulder.
[8747.34s -> 8747.66s]  Yep.
[8747.66s -> 8749.16s]  Left arm.
[8749.16s -> 8750.12s]  Yep.
[8750.12s -> 8750.76s]  Right arm.
[8750.76s -> 8751.32s]  Nothing.
[8751.32s -> 8752.04s]  Right leg.
[8752.04s -> 8753.82s]  Yep.
[8753.82s -> 8754.46s]  Right leg.
[8754.46s -> 8755.42s]  Left leg.
[8755.42s -> 8755.90s]  Submit.
[8770.55s -> 8771.83s]  Oh, man.
[8771.83s -> 8772.63s]  That was bad.
[8772.63s -> 8773.43s]  I'm awake.
[8773.43s -> 8773.75s]  I'm awake.
[8773.75s -> 8774.39s]  I woke up.
[8774.39s -> 8775.80s]  I woke up.
[8775.80s -> 8779.56s]  I'm good.
[8779.56s -> 8780.20s]  I'm awake.
[8780.20s -> 8784.70s]  Come on.
[8784.70s -> 8786.26s]  Where's the light?
[8786.26s -> 8798.20s]  All right.
[8798.20s -> 8806.30s]  We need this stuff.
[8806.30s -> 8809.96s]  Eye caps.
[8809.96s -> 8810.92s]  Everything I need right now.
[8816.33s -> 8816.81s]  Yeah.
[8816.81s -> 8817.21s]  Yeah.
[8817.21s -> 8817.61s]  Yeah.
[8817.61s -> 8818.01s]  Yep.
[8818.01s -> 8818.33s]  Yep.
[8835.22s -> 8836.02s]  Okay.
[8836.02s -> 8836.74s]  Fluid time.
[8843.53s -> 8844.94s]  Fluid.
[8844.94s -> 8846.54s]  It's time to make some delicious fluid.
[8874.09s -> 8875.53s]  I'm missing something.
[8875.53s -> 8876.73s]  Yes, I am.
[8880.78s -> 8881.50s]  Tubes.
[8881.50s -> 8935.54s]  Clay tablet in the center is called a mark.
[8936.92s -> 8939.88s]  Placing the smaller pieces in the correct configuration
[8939.88s -> 8941.16s]  will spell the demon's name.
[8942.89s -> 8947.37s]  Second, the bottles on the top shelf are a special reagent
[8947.37s -> 8948.65s]  that will react to the mark.
[8948.65s -> 8952.38s]  Add a bottle to the embalming mixture during the process.
[8952.38s -> 8954.98s]  When the mark is placed on the correct body,
[8954.98s -> 8958.42s]  the reagent inside it will force the demon to become
[8958.42s -> 8960.39s]  bound to it.
[8960.39s -> 8962.55s]  Pay attention to signs that you have chosen
[8962.55s -> 8967.86s]  correct, obvious, or extremely subtle.
[8967.86s -> 8970.82s]  Once you are certain that the demon is bound to its vessel,
[8970.82s -> 8979.75s]  describe the sigils of its name in our world
[8979.75s -> 8981.90s]  to begin the evocation.
[8981.90s -> 8984.38s]  You will need to uncover these sigils to use them.
[8985.66s -> 8988.22s]  Hold a letting strip up while wandering the mortuary.
[8988.94s -> 8991.66s]  If it begins to smolder and burn, your clothes...
[8991.66s -> 8992.78s]  Who the fuck are you?
[8992.78s -> 8994.86s]  ...when the paper combusts, the sigil
[8994.86s -> 8996.70s]  has been revealed somewhere in that area.
[8998.74s -> 9001.38s]  Can we turn off the Disney World line audio?
[9002.34s -> 9002.74s]  Stop!
[9033.03s -> 9036.58s]  And remember, the most important rule.
[9036.58s -> 9048.06s]  Have fun on Splash Mountain.
[9048.06s -> 9050.62s]  1970, the year of arrival of the House of Death.
[9051.98s -> 9053.74s]  What the heck?
[9068.86s -> 9070.46s]  Come on, where is it?
[9070.46s -> 9082.07s]  I don't need this job.
[9082.07s -> 9082.71s]  See you later.
[9084.42s -> 9086.50s]  All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[9086.50s -> 9087.38s]  All right, that's about...
[9088.18s -> 9089.86s]  I'm going to call that a...
[9090.58s -> 9092.42s]  I don't know, a Hearthstone symbol.
[9100.28s -> 9101.24s]  Did you move?
[9101.24s -> 9105.11s]  Oh, we need the bathroom cleaner.
[9105.11s -> 9125.03s]  And then we got to, um, moisturize.
[9125.03s -> 9127.75s]  And then I don't know, I'm not getting anything from this guy.
[9127.75s -> 9131.38s]  I'm not getting anything from this guy.
[9131.38s -> 9131.94s]  I don't think it's him.
[9132.58s -> 9137.43s]  All right, we know it's this one, right?
[9137.43s -> 9138.15s]  Hearthstone symbol.
[9138.71s -> 9150.10s]  I'm missing something.
[9151.93s -> 9152.89s]  Don't do it right.
[9156.70s -> 9157.58s]  Put the wrong...
[9157.58s -> 9158.70s]  Oh, okay, right.
[9158.70s -> 9163.18s]  Wrong symbol.
[9163.18s -> 9172.63s]  No, get it right.
[9172.63s -> 9174.23s]  Don't get it right.
[9174.23s -> 9175.19s]  Do not get it right.
[9175.19s -> 9177.16s]  Secret ending.
[9177.16s -> 9177.88s]  Do it right.
[9177.88s -> 9179.56s]  Well, I mean, I don't...
[9179.56s -> 9180.44s]  It's not this guy.
[9180.44s -> 9181.16s]  So that's...
[9181.16s -> 9183.83s]  I know that pretty much for a fact.
[9183.83s -> 9184.55s]  It's not this guy.
[9198.39s -> 9205.75s]  Who's there?
[9205.75s -> 9207.40s]  Yeah, let's do a poll.
[9207.40s -> 9208.20s]  All right, run a poll.
[9208.20s -> 9211.00s]  Do you want me to get it right?
[9211.00s -> 9231.10s]  Or do you want me to get it wrong on purpose and get a different ending?
[9231.10s -> 9232.70s]  I need to get it twisted.
[9244.65s -> 9251.13s]  Okay.
[9251.13s -> 9279.80s]  Are you moving?
[9279.80s -> 9280.76s]  I'll get it.
[9280.76s -> 9285.43s]  Hello?
[9285.43s -> 9285.93s]  Hello?
[9286.71s -> 9297.91s]  It's you.
[9297.91s -> 9299.19s]  Leave all the windows open?
[9299.19s -> 9314.20s]  No, the bugs will get in.
[9314.20s -> 9320.92s]  I don't want to do that.
[9347.03s -> 9347.51s]  Wait.
[9347.51s -> 9348.23s]  There we go.
[9348.23s -> 9350.95s]  Okay, those are some scrapes.
[9350.95s -> 9353.82s]  Those are scrapes.
[9353.82s -> 9354.62s]  Do it right.
[9354.62s -> 9359.24s]  Okay.
[9359.24s -> 9360.52s]  This scrapes all over.
[9360.52s -> 9377.37s]  Rebecca?
[9377.37s -> 9388.14s]  Oh, damn it.
[9388.14s -> 9400.78s]  Rebecca, come here.
[9422.79s -> 9438.09s]  Mom, you stupid bitch.
[9439.62s -> 9442.23s]  Hate me all you want.
[9442.23s -> 9445.58s]  He's dead because of you.
[9445.58s -> 9446.86s]  You should be the one here.
[9454.63s -> 9455.19s]  All right, leave.
[9457.50s -> 9465.78s]  Give it to me.
[9465.78s -> 9466.66s]  You bitch.
[9466.66s -> 9467.38s]  Give it to me.
[9467.38s -> 9468.42s]  Let me in.
[9468.42s -> 9473.56s]  I love that voice.
[9473.56s -> 9474.92s]  Let me in.
[9474.92s -> 9476.12s]  Let me in your house.
[9476.12s -> 9476.68s]  Let me in.
[9476.68s -> 9477.56s]  Let me in your house.
[9480.30s -> 9483.13s]  I can't move.
[9483.13s -> 9492.90s]  Okay.
[9492.90s -> 9493.38s]  All right.
[9493.38s -> 9496.33s]  So, where were we?
[9496.33s -> 9497.29s]  Oh, right.
[9497.29s -> 9503.21s]  Did I not print it?
[9503.21s -> 9507.02s]  Wait.
[9507.02s -> 9507.58s]  No, I didn't.
[9507.58s -> 9508.22s]  Okay, I did.
[9508.22s -> 9520.90s]  Let me in your house.
[9520.90s -> 9523.86s]  All right, now we got to do this shit.
[9523.86s -> 9526.50s]  I already have one of those.
[9526.50s -> 9539.78s]  Okay, well, let's do it then.
[9539.78s -> 9544.01s]  There we go.
[9544.01s -> 9544.97s]  I'm missing something.
[9545.53s -> 9553.16s]  Okay.
[9553.80s -> 9557.45s]  All right.
[9558.78s -> 9559.82s]  Now, let's begin this.
[9562.58s -> 9563.30s]  We need the fluid.
[9586.84s -> 9588.28s]  I just made a warhead.
[9588.28s -> 9589.24s]  It was so sour.
[9591.91s -> 9594.39s]  Why the fuck did we fill this shit?
[9594.39s -> 9596.79s]  Why did we put this in people?
[9596.79s -> 9598.39s]  Who was the first person that was like,
[9598.39s -> 9599.11s]  oh, you know what?
[9599.11s -> 9600.41s]  I have an idea.
[9600.41s -> 9602.41s]  Let's pump this person full of formaldehyde.
[9604.46s -> 9605.58s]  Why would somebody?
[9605.58s -> 9606.30s]  What for what?
[9606.86s -> 9608.54s]  Who decided to do that?
[9608.54s -> 9611.78s]  Oh, shit.
[9611.78s -> 9612.66s]  Hold on.
[9624.58s -> 9625.54s]  Yeah, where is it?
[9632.86s -> 9635.69s]  Pi.
[9635.69s -> 9636.97s]  All right, we got Pi.
[9639.77s -> 9645.72s]  Okay, who could it be?
[9645.72s -> 9646.76s]  What's my code?
[9646.76s -> 9647.56s]  Do I have a code?
[9648.70s -> 9649.82s]  I don't have a code, do I?
[9657.53s -> 9658.89s]  I'm so confused, didn't I?
[9658.89s -> 9661.38s]  This was my ID in here before.
[9661.38s -> 9674.22s]  Two, four, six, three, three.
[9674.22s -> 9678.01s]  Okay, Pi and Hearthstone.
[9681.00s -> 9683.14s]  No.
[9683.14s -> 9688.65s]  Okay, it could be Telduck.
[9688.65s -> 9695.86s]  Telduck?
[9695.86s -> 9706.49s]  No, it's probably Telduck.
[9706.49s -> 9707.78s]  Telduck.
[9707.78s -> 9708.82s]  All right, what's Telduck?
[9712.33s -> 9719.24s]  Pi, Hearthstone, Bong, and J.
[9719.24s -> 9721.14s]  So we need to find...
[9721.14s -> 9722.18s]  So it's Bong and J.
[9722.18s -> 9723.22s]  So that's definitely it.
[9727.77s -> 9732.33s]  Bong is at the top, right?
[9732.33s -> 9735.37s]  Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, J.
[9735.37s -> 9745.82s]  Okay.
[9745.82s -> 9746.94s]  I can't hold anything else.
[9746.94s -> 9747.66s]  So that's done.
[9752.12s -> 9754.54s]  Right, incision.
[9754.54s -> 9755.90s]  Don't scare me, idiot.
[9755.90s -> 9758.97s]  I need a scalpel.
[9758.97s -> 9770.36s]  I already have one of those.
[9770.36s -> 9771.32s]  Oh, I forgot to put...
[9771.32s -> 9771.96s]  Okay.
[9771.96s -> 9774.34s]  I already have one of those.
[9774.34s -> 9775.30s]  What are you talking about?
[9777.43s -> 9777.93s]  Oh.
[9785.35s -> 9786.07s]  Tube.
[9786.07s -> 9795.90s]  Let's pump.
[9831.37s -> 9834.31s]  Where do I go from here?
[9835.03s -> 9841.02s]  Okay, turn it off.
[9843.96s -> 9844.92s]  Turn that off.
[9844.92s -> 9847.08s]  Close it up.
[9847.08s -> 9852.62s]  What's wrong?
[9856.73s -> 9858.01s]  Something does feel weird.
[9858.01s -> 9864.65s]  I feel like I've been permanently changed.
[9864.65s -> 9866.25s]  Okay, let's go back here.
[9872.82s -> 9873.78s]  Don't even do it.
[9874.58s -> 9875.46s]  Don't do it.
[9875.46s -> 9881.50s]  Okay, the AC just turned on
[9881.50s -> 9884.39s]  and I felt something touch my arm
[9884.39s -> 9899.27s]  and I almost puked.
[9899.27s -> 9899.77s]  There we go.
[9900.71s -> 9907.70s]  Okay, bathroom.
[9918.34s -> 9918.84s]  Oh.
[9921.14s -> 9921.86s]  No, close those.
[9921.86s -> 9922.50s]  I don't want this open.
[9951.14s -> 9952.42s]  Oh, my God.
[9952.42s -> 9953.06s]  That's a...
[9953.06s -> 9954.82s]  Has somebody shot me with a gun?
[9954.82s -> 9971.74s]  We're getting some really good tuber reactions.
[9971.74s -> 9973.18s]  Yeah, you really are today.
[9973.18s -> 9977.18s]  All right, I'm going to put this on...
[9977.18s -> 9979.77s]  Let's see what happens here.
[9979.77s -> 9986.57s]  I don't think it's her either.
[9986.57s -> 9990.70s]  Are you sure this is the right...
[9990.70s -> 9992.62s]  No, I don't think it's you either.
[9992.62s -> 10010.52s]  I can't hold anything else.
[10011.32s -> 10012.55s]  Is it really...
[10012.55s -> 10013.91s]  This is a huge tuber stream?
[10013.91s -> 10014.63s]  Yeah, it is.
[10014.63s -> 10018.38s]  Dude, why is Holly behind you with a mask on?
[10018.38s -> 10022.14s]  Fucking terrifying.
[10022.14s -> 10022.64s]  Okay.
[10022.64s -> 10025.22s]  I'm missing something.
[10025.22s -> 10026.18s]  Oh, right.
[10026.18s -> 10033.02s]  Oysterizer.
[10033.02s -> 10033.52s]  All right.
[10043.58s -> 10044.14s]  Hey, Josh.
[10044.70s -> 10046.89s]  What's that?
[10046.89s -> 10048.01s]  It's definitely you.
[10076.79s -> 10078.23s]  It's definitely this guy.
[10078.23s -> 10080.63s]  There's nothing weird happening with these ones.
[10080.63s -> 10087.18s]  Let's see if something weird happens with you.
[10095.37s -> 10095.85s]  Yeah.
[10095.85s -> 10096.57s]  I mean, come on.
[10096.57s -> 10096.97s]  Look at...
[10106.70s -> 10107.90s]  Do we even really need to do this
[10107.90s -> 10119.13s]  or should I just burn him?
[10119.13s -> 10121.53s]  It's definitely this guy.
[10121.53s -> 10122.17s]  We don't even...
[10122.17s -> 10123.37s]  I'm just going to burn him now.
[10123.37s -> 10136.65s]  Let's go, buddy.
[10136.65s -> 10142.84s]  How dare you smile?
[10142.84s -> 10143.16s]  No, no.
[10143.16s -> 10144.20s]  I want to take him out.
[10144.20s -> 10149.11s]  I can't.
[10149.11s -> 10150.63s]  Oh, I can't move him now?
[10150.63s -> 10177.11s]  Oh, fine.
[10177.11s -> 10177.67s]  There we go.
[10178.55s -> 10184.79s]  So you're saying I'm holding these coins and shit, right?
[10184.79s -> 10187.19s]  Five-year coin, ten-year coin, necklace.
[10187.19s -> 10191.29s]  You're saying that I can...
[10191.29s -> 10194.87s]  This is the secret end if I get this all.
[10194.87s -> 10209.80s]  If I do this.
[10209.80s -> 10210.76s]  You have to get it right, okay?
[10222.04s -> 10232.89s]  I have to use the items correctly.
[10232.89s -> 10238.06s]  There's going to be some stupid right here.
[10246.55s -> 10251.06s]  Missing something.
[10251.06s -> 10251.38s]  Look at...
[10251.38s -> 10252.02s]  He's like...
[10252.02s -> 10253.38s]  His smile's even bigger now.
[10253.38s -> 10254.90s]  It's definitely this guy.
[10254.90s -> 10279.16s]  There's no doubt.
[10279.16s -> 10280.12s]  There we go.
[10280.12s -> 10285.28s]  All right.
[10285.28s -> 10300.44s]  I can feel something coming.
[10300.44s -> 10306.16s]  I knew it.
[10306.16s -> 10309.08s]  I'm not even checking.
[10309.08s -> 10309.40s]  It's just...
[10309.40s -> 10309.80s]  You're going to...
[10309.80s -> 10311.00s]  You're slamming the thing.
[10311.56s -> 10312.36s]  Doesn't matter.
[10312.36s -> 10330.03s]  This wasn't here before.
[10344.32s -> 10345.36s]  Oh, my God.
[10353.98s -> 10354.86s]  Come here, bitch.
[10367.79s -> 10368.83s]  Oh, that's bad.
[10370.86s -> 10403.13s]  Wait, four.
[10403.13s -> 10404.17s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10404.73s -> 10407.12s]  Last lot, four.
[10407.12s -> 10408.00s]  First, one.
[10408.00s -> 10408.88s]  First lot, one.
[10408.88s -> 10409.92s]  Last lot, four.
[10409.92s -> 10413.80s]  Second, last lot, four.
[10413.80s -> 10415.16s]  One, something, something, something, four, four.
[10418.20s -> 10419.08s]  One, four, four.
[10420.72s -> 10421.20s]  Four, four.
[10421.76s -> 10422.96s]  One, and then something in four, four.
[10426.84s -> 10428.28s]  I can't see this one.
[10428.28s -> 10429.48s]  One, something, four, four, four.
[10431.36s -> 10433.12s]  One, something, seven, something, four, four.
[10433.68s -> 10435.04s]  One, seven, something, four, four.
[10437.82s -> 10440.06s]  One, something, seven, zero, four, four.
[10440.06s -> 10441.42s]  One, something, seven, zero, four, four.
[10442.99s -> 10444.51s]  One, something, seven, zero, four, four.
[10448.32s -> 10451.58s]  One, one, nine, seven, zero, four, four.
[10451.58s -> 10454.76s]  Got it.
[10454.76s -> 10456.44s]  One, nine, seven, zero, four, four.
[10460.60s -> 10461.88s]  What's the, I can, what's the, how do I,
[10461.88s -> 10462.68s]  what do I punch the code?
[10462.68s -> 10465.16s]  One, one, seven, one, nine, seven, zero, four.
[10465.16s -> 10465.88s]  How would I punch it in?
[10469.00s -> 10470.04s]  What do I punch the code in?
[10472.91s -> 10474.19s]  One, nine, seven, zero, four, four.
[10474.83s -> 10480.72s]  Give me the fuck out of here.
[10480.72s -> 10490.35s]  Whose mouth did I not open?
[10490.91s -> 10508.38s]  Give me that key.
[10508.38s -> 10514.40s]  Bye.
[10514.40s -> 10515.20s]  Here, come here.
[10539.90s -> 10540.94s]  I'm gonna go left.
[10540.94s -> 10543.28s]  I make my own way.
[10543.28s -> 10554.62s]  David Whitlow, December 8th, 1949.
[10555.34s -> 10561.44s]  Oh, somebody said Abraham Lincoln.
[10570.30s -> 10571.02s]  Um, what?
[10593.48s -> 10597.48s]  Jesus, what the hell was that?
[10597.48s -> 10613.60s]  How do I get in there?
[10613.60s -> 10634.75s]  All right, there was a keypad under a thing here, right?
[10634.75s -> 10639.45s]  I remember, where I was like, what is this for?
[10639.45s -> 10644.68s]  It's like down here, right?
[10644.68s -> 10646.51s]  Yep.
[10646.51s -> 10649.31s]  One, nine, seven, zero, four, four.
[10649.31s -> 10651.58s]  Key to the hatch.
[10651.58s -> 10652.68s]  Let's go.
[10652.68s -> 10654.96s]  Oh God.
[10693.05s -> 10698.56s]  Just coming to get a refill, man.
[10698.56s -> 10707.39s]  I'm missing something.
[10707.39s -> 10721.32s]  Shit, it's too much.
[10721.98s -> 10730.09s]  Give me a TLDR.
[10730.09s -> 10731.45s]  Somebody just give me a TL...
[10731.45s -> 10733.05s]  Just somebody read it for me.
[10733.05s -> 10750.19s]  Okay.
[10750.19s -> 10774.56s]  The raging is the blood of the possessed.
[10774.56s -> 10776.65s]  What the fuck?
[10776.65s -> 10777.45s]  Thanks for the...
[10777.45s -> 10777.93s]  Yeah.
[10777.93s -> 10779.37s]  Spoilers, by the way.
[10779.37s -> 10783.82s]  Thanks, guys.
[10783.82s -> 10785.28s]  Oh, here we go.
[10785.28s -> 10785.60s]  Good.
[10785.60s -> 10786.24s]  I don't have to read it.
[10786.24s -> 10787.32s]  I'm missing something.
[10787.32s -> 10788.44s]  It'll just tell it to me.
[10788.44s -> 10815.77s]  Oh, shit.
[10815.77s -> 10816.81s]  So he's a demon.
[10816.81s -> 10825.69s]  Turned him on me?
[10868.86s -> 10871.53s]  Whoa.
[10871.53s -> 10872.49s]  The heck, dude?
[10873.50s -> 10874.62s]  What the fuck?
[10874.62s -> 10880.25s]  Okay.
[10880.25s -> 10892.11s]  No, they're not personal pizzas.
[10892.11s -> 10892.67s]  What?
[10892.67s -> 10903.44s]  Did that guy get up?
[10903.44s -> 10904.40s]  Open the door?
[10904.40s -> 10905.04s]  I don't...
[10905.04s -> 10905.76s]  I can't.
[10905.76s -> 10907.88s]  There's another...
[10907.88s -> 10910.12s]  There's an old key in the drawer with the ID in it.
[10910.12s -> 10912.38s]  Are you shitting me?
[10912.38s -> 10922.08s]  Oh, man.
[10922.08s -> 10923.29s]  Wait.
[10923.29s -> 10926.28s]  How do I pick it up?
[10926.28s -> 10927.96s]  Mr. Delva's extra keys.
[10927.96s -> 10928.76s]  How do I use them?
[10928.76s -> 10931.82s]  Why can't I pick them up?
[10931.82s -> 10938.65s]  Okay.
[10938.65s -> 10939.61s]  Well, let's go.
[10939.61s -> 10943.28s]  Yeah, fuck that guy.
[10943.28s -> 10943.68s]  Who cares?
[10968.32s -> 10984.60s]  What the hell?
[10984.60s -> 10985.56s]  Can't you hear me?
[10993.79s -> 10994.03s]  Wait.
[10994.03s -> 10994.83s]  That's a...
[10994.83s -> 10996.59s]  That's TTT9.
[11019.74s -> 11020.54s]  You!
[11020.54s -> 11029.05s]  Is Raymond here?
[11029.05s -> 11032.83s]  Do you see what he's doing?
[11032.83s -> 11034.35s]  Do this to someone.
[11034.35s -> 11036.72s]  I think you should let me out.
[11041.26s -> 11042.86s]  You ain't going anywhere.
[11042.86s -> 11043.34s]  Shut up.
[11047.50s -> 11049.10s]  I want wishes.
[11049.10s -> 11051.34s]  I want wishes or you ain't going anywhere.
[11051.34s -> 11052.46s]  I want wishes.
[11052.46s -> 11055.53s]  You'll be here soon.
[11055.53s -> 11056.97s]  I want wishes and I'll let you out.
[11056.97s -> 11065.56s]  Three of them.
[11065.56s -> 11066.92s]  It's a simple trade.
[11066.92s -> 11068.75s]  I let you out?
[11068.75s -> 11070.11s]  You give me three wishes.
[11070.11s -> 11071.39s]  You give me whatever I want.
[11071.39s -> 11076.97s]  But you have to promise not to kill me when you get out.
[11076.97s -> 11077.61s]  That's my...
[11077.61s -> 11078.81s]  That's what I have to say.
[11078.81s -> 11082.01s]  I know every time that in a movie when this happens,
[11082.01s -> 11083.13s]  it's typically,
[11084.16s -> 11087.04s]  oh, I summoned fucking Voldemort.
[11087.04s -> 11087.44s]  Whatever.
[11087.44s -> 11089.72s]  And they just like the second they get out,
[11089.72s -> 11090.52s]  they kill the first person,
[11090.52s -> 11093.02s]  which is usually the person that summoned them, right?
[11093.02s -> 11093.90s]  And why is that?
[11093.90s -> 11095.02s]  That's fucked up.
[11095.02s -> 11097.95s]  Can we go over this just very quickly?
[11097.95s -> 11100.43s]  That's fucked up.
[11100.43s -> 11102.51s]  Every time that in any video game,
[11102.51s -> 11103.23s]  in any movie,
[11103.23s -> 11104.03s]  any TV show,
[11104.59s -> 11108.68s]  the guy that spends his entire lifetime summoning
[11108.68s -> 11111.24s]  or bringing back the ultimate bad guy
[11111.88s -> 11116.62s]  is the first person for the ultimate bad guy to kill.
[11116.70s -> 11119.61s]  It's unfair.
[11119.61s -> 11121.77s]  That's absolutely not fair.
[11121.77s -> 11132.24s]  Do you know how hard it was to bring you back?
[11132.24s -> 11133.76s]  That's unfair.
[11133.76s -> 11145.69s]  I'll mark this one down as maybe.
[11146.81s -> 11152.49s]  Maybe we'll come back.
[11152.49s -> 11156.04s]  What about Peter Pettigrew?
[11156.04s -> 11156.44s]  All right.
[11156.44s -> 11158.52s]  All I remember from Peter Pettigrew is this.
[11162.78s -> 11165.16s]  That's it.
[11165.16s -> 11186.14s]  That's all I remember.
[11186.14s -> 11186.38s]  All right.
[11186.38s -> 11188.60s]  So now what?
[11188.60s -> 11194.56s]  It's this guy smiling.
[11194.56s -> 11195.92s]  Go get her blood.
[11195.92s -> 11200.52s]  Wait, go get her blood?
[11200.52s -> 11201.16s]  Get the blood.
[11201.16s -> 11202.12s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11202.12s -> 11205.40s]  You mean go get the blood that was next to her and use it here?
[11205.40s -> 11206.88s]  Where should I use it?
[11206.88s -> 11212.27s]  The bottles of her blood.
[11213.68s -> 11215.44s]  All the reagents are her blood.
[11215.44s -> 11216.72s]  Yeah, that's what I'm imagining.
[11220.52s -> 11223.90s]  Yeah, this is all her.
[11223.90s -> 11225.26s]  Yeah, it's all this is all her.
[11225.26s -> 11227.29s]  I already have it.
[11227.29s -> 11230.22s]  Yeah, that's scary.
[11231.53s -> 11232.17s]  All right.
[11232.17s -> 11232.89s]  Where was I?
[11234.08s -> 11234.40s]  Right.
[11234.40s -> 11235.60s]  We have to do this.
[11235.60s -> 11242.11s]  That was scary.
[11242.11s -> 11242.35s]  All right.
[11242.35s -> 11243.55s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11243.55s -> 11243.79s]  Let me.
[11244.65s -> 11244.97s]  Okay.
[11244.97s -> 11245.29s]  Okay.
[11245.29s -> 11245.53s]  Okay.
[11245.53s -> 11245.69s]  Okay.
[11245.69s -> 11245.93s]  Okay.
[11245.93s -> 11246.09s]  Okay.
[11246.09s -> 11246.49s]  Come on.
[11246.49s -> 11246.65s]  Fine.
[11246.65s -> 11247.85s]  I gotta get back into this before I die.
[11260.86s -> 11261.66s]  Get the tubes.
[11268.59s -> 11269.63s]  And let's pump.
[11269.63s -> 11274.64s]  What's wrong?
[11275.20s -> 11279.87s]  What's wrong?
[11284.54s -> 11285.42s]  You already did this.
[11293.29s -> 11294.09s]  Wait, here comes.
[11294.09s -> 11295.85s]  Let me in, you bitch.
[11295.85s -> 11296.73s]  All right, this is it.
[11305.63s -> 11306.91s]  No, no, I didn't want to let you in.
[11306.91s -> 11307.95s]  Don't you miss me?
[11316.30s -> 11321.29s]  Maybe you could slit your wrist for me.
[11321.29s -> 11326.08s]  Just a little cut.
[11326.08s -> 11327.28s]  What's wrong?
[11345.85s -> 11348.17s]  I ain't ever inviting grandma to Christmas ever again.
[11352.11s -> 11352.35s]  Sorry.
[11352.35s -> 11352.83s]  That was weird.
[11352.83s -> 11354.11s]  I was like, why can't I not press the button?
[11362.24s -> 11362.64s]  All right.
[11363.63s -> 11364.86s]  Pump.
[11364.86s -> 11365.66s]  Turn off pump.
[11365.66s -> 11367.66s]  Remove tubes and fill.
[11392.48s -> 11392.96s]  How do I?
[11392.96s -> 11394.56s]  Somebody said, go kill the basement lady.
[11394.56s -> 11395.12s]  I don't know how.
[11395.84s -> 11396.86s]  How do I do that?
[11398.88s -> 11399.52s]  Oh, shit.
[11399.52s -> 11400.24s]  Something's going to happen.
[11400.24s -> 11400.96s]  Something's about to happen.
[11400.96s -> 11401.68s]  Something's going to happen.
[11401.68s -> 11412.57s]  I'm sitting in the corner.
[11412.57s -> 11413.13s]  Her mark.
[11414.70s -> 11422.04s]  Oh, wait, it was tear, tear, parka, parka, tear, parka, parka, tear.
[11422.04s -> 11426.81s]  I can't do it.
[11426.81s -> 11427.85s]  I can't do it.
[11427.85s -> 11433.37s]  What?
[11433.37s -> 11434.41s]  Yeah, I can't.
[11434.73s -> 11440.83s]  It's three T's.
[11440.83s -> 11442.11s]  There's tiles in the basement.
[11445.92s -> 11446.32s]  Whatever.
[11447.44s -> 11451.52s]  What is it again?
[11453.82s -> 11455.74s]  Such YouTuber reactions.
[11455.74s -> 11456.35s]  All right.
[11456.35s -> 11457.39s]  Who was this?
[11457.39s -> 11460.12s]  It was Tell Duck, right?
[11460.12s -> 11462.12s]  Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, Jay.
[11464.33s -> 11466.17s]  Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, Jay.
[11466.17s -> 11468.40s]  All right.
[11468.40s -> 11469.28s]  All right.
[11469.28s -> 11471.20s]  Why does the thunder scare you?
[11471.20s -> 11472.56s]  I don't know, because it's just sudden.
[11473.53s -> 11474.09s]  All right.
[11474.09s -> 11474.89s]  Yeah, I get it.
[11474.89s -> 11475.21s]  Come on.
[11475.21s -> 11475.53s]  Hurry up.
[11476.84s -> 11477.32s]  Stop it.
[11478.04s -> 11482.08s]  I'm fine.
[11510.86s -> 11511.42s]  There we go.
[11513.21s -> 11513.53s]  Okay.
[11515.05s -> 11516.25s]  Let's put you.
[11517.37s -> 11518.41s]  Oh, I don't want to leave.
[11518.41s -> 11525.15s]  I don't want to go back in here because the grandma's here.
[11525.15s -> 11525.79s]  Uh-oh.
[11525.79s -> 11535.79s]  Oh, don't you want to say hi and hello to your grandmother?
[11535.79s -> 11537.07s]  I'm so scared.
[11537.07s -> 11540.00s]  Don't you want to say hi to your grandmother?
[11549.00s -> 11551.24s]  No, don't you want to say hi to your grandmother?
[11563.21s -> 11564.33s]  It's definitely you.
[11564.33s -> 11565.61s]  Burn, I've got the coins, right?
[11566.17s -> 11571.95s]  All right.
[11571.95s -> 11572.51s]  Okay, it's time.
[11572.51s -> 11572.83s]  It's time.
[11572.83s -> 11573.23s]  It's time.
[11573.23s -> 11574.11s]  Let's put it on.
[11574.11s -> 11589.20s]  So you're saying if I do this now, I get a super ending.
[11599.53s -> 11601.45s]  Do you think it's the wrong one?
[11603.61s -> 11605.68s]  I wonder if it's the right one.
[11609.64s -> 11609.96s]  Okay.
[11609.96s -> 11612.20s]  So now I'm going to get a secret ending.
[11615.00s -> 11619.64s]  I have 10 year coin, five year coin and the necklace.
[11619.64s -> 11620.44s]  Am I good?
[11621.16s -> 11633.16s]  Surely.
[11633.16s -> 11633.56s]  Surely.
[11633.56s -> 11633.96s]  Surely.
[11634.60s -> 11637.61s]  Double check your stuff.
[11637.61s -> 11640.33s]  Yeah, I got my coins and I got the necklace, right?
[11641.05s -> 11644.48s]  See you later.
[11646.51s -> 11646.75s]  What?
[11649.55s -> 11650.27s]  What are you talking about?
[11652.72s -> 11653.60s]  Um, what?
[11654.40s -> 11655.80s]  Where's the fucking power?
[11656.52s -> 11657.92s]  Where's the power?
[11671.55s -> 11672.03s]  Oh, no.
[11672.43s -> 11673.39s]  It's gonna get up.
[11685.00s -> 11685.64s]  Oh, I just fell.
[11686.60s -> 11688.12s]  I just literally tripped.
[11688.12s -> 11689.00s]  There was nothing scary.
[11689.00s -> 11690.28s]  I just tripped on the rug.
[11690.28s -> 11709.95s]  How do I turn it on?
[11709.95s -> 11710.27s]  What?
[11711.52s -> 11713.60s]  I need the tiles from the basement.
[11713.60s -> 11725.85s]  I don't want to go back in the fucking basement.
[11725.85s -> 11769.48s]  Dude, where?
[11769.48s -> 11770.44s]  Oh, you were full of shit.
[11770.44s -> 11771.16s]  Okay, nevermind.
[11771.16s -> 11777.71s]  I think it might be bugged.
[11777.71s -> 11789.61s]  It didn't moisturize.
[11789.61s -> 11790.33s]  Yeah, it did look.
[11790.33s -> 11811.00s]  What the hell?
[11811.00s -> 11817.47s]  I have to put him back in?
[11830.32s -> 11845.92s]  What?
[11845.92s -> 11855.04s]  Uh, why won't he go on?
[11855.04s -> 11856.24s]  You didn't finish all the...
[11856.24s -> 11856.96s]  That's the last one.
[11857.85s -> 11859.55s]  I did it all.
[11859.55s -> 11861.15s]  There's a fourth body and there's none.
[11883.92s -> 11887.05s]  Um, what?
[11896.04s -> 11896.36s]  It's...
[11896.36s -> 11897.08s]  It bugged out?
[11902.41s -> 11904.25s]  Yeah, I tried the fuse box in the bathroom.
[11904.25s -> 11906.41s]  It didn't do anything.
[11906.41s -> 11916.24s]  Um, I think this is screwed up.
[11916.24s -> 11917.44s]  Check your tablet.
[11917.44s -> 11921.15s]  There are no tiles in it.
[11921.15s -> 11922.03s]  Yeah, there is.
[11922.03s -> 11926.41s]  No, that's correct.
[11926.41s -> 11932.84s]  I think it's screwed up.
[11932.84s -> 11935.16s]  Um, I just reload the game.
[11935.16s -> 11960.08s]  Okay, return body to cold storage.
[11960.08s -> 11964.99s]  So, we're back.
[11964.99s -> 11968.75s]  This is it right here.
[11968.75s -> 11969.71s]  Take the mark.
[11969.71s -> 11975.44s]  Here we go.
[11975.44s -> 11976.64s]  Yep, looks good.
[11976.64s -> 11980.03s]  Come with me.
[11980.03s -> 11994.56s]  All right, we're back in cold storage.
[11996.76s -> 11997.56s]  Is that good?
[12004.96s -> 12007.05s]  Oh.
[12007.05s -> 12007.37s]  Burn.
[12008.64s -> 12009.44s]  There we go.
[12009.44s -> 12010.32s]  All right, let's go for it.
[12013.80s -> 12014.84s]  I got the coins, right?
[12014.84s -> 12015.08s]  Yep.
[12015.72s -> 12025.02s]  Who's knocking?
[12025.02s -> 12036.80s]  Got it.
[12042.75s -> 12043.23s]  Ow.
[12059.23s -> 12060.35s]  So, this is a secret ending?
[12070.99s -> 12072.43s]  It's not a secret ending.
[12077.40s -> 12078.36s]  It's not a secret.
[12087.63s -> 12089.31s]  A secret Raymond ending.
[12090.43s -> 12094.83s]  Down there, right now, just suffering for no reason.
[12094.83s -> 12096.51s]  Valerie is not down there.
[12100.12s -> 12102.12s]  She's been gone for years.
[12102.12s -> 12103.24s]  You don't know that.
[12106.33s -> 12107.93s]  You're just gonna let her stay there.
[12109.07s -> 12111.71s]  You don't know what she's feeling.
[12111.71s -> 12113.31s]  You are torturing her.
[12113.31s -> 12114.75s]  She's helping me survive.
[12115.39s -> 12117.63s]  She's helping us survive.
[12118.99s -> 12121.87s]  Without her, there's no reagent.
[12121.87s -> 12124.67s]  Without the reagent, we have nothing.
[12125.63s -> 12128.51s]  You want to have a chance at life, it comes with a cost.
[12129.15s -> 12129.95s]  This cost.
[12130.91s -> 12133.79s]  You have to make a choice, just like I did.
[12133.79s -> 12134.59s]  What choice?
[12135.23s -> 12139.47s]  Keep her alive to just bleed her over and over again to save ourselves?
[12140.35s -> 12141.87s]  She can't be saved.
[12141.87s -> 12143.87s]  End the torture.
[12143.87s -> 12146.27s]  She's down there suffering for your own gain.
[12146.27s -> 12146.99s]  My gain?
[12147.55s -> 12148.27s]  My gain?
[12149.60s -> 12150.72s]  You used her too.
[12151.68s -> 12153.84s]  It didn't stop you from finishing the job.
[12154.64s -> 12156.32s]  You used her blood anyway.
[12157.28s -> 12160.56s]  When it came down to it, you chose survival.
[12161.68s -> 12162.72s]  Actually, you never told me that.
[12163.84s -> 12166.72s]  I did not come with a context of what was necessary to know that.
[12173.95s -> 12175.55s]  No, you drank it too.
[12176.51s -> 12180.86s]  I've seen many experience what you did.
[12180.86s -> 12183.08s]  None have survived.
[12183.08s -> 12189.34s]  I've watched them degrade and suffer until they're no longer themselves.
[12189.34s -> 12194.04s]  I didn't know what else to do and just let them suffer.
[12194.60s -> 12199.04s]  I searched for years to find a way to reverse it.
[12199.60s -> 12202.73s]  All I found was the way to prevent more.
[12202.73s -> 12206.00s]  Isn't that better than nothing?
[12206.00s -> 12209.48s]  I killed them all, Rebecca.
[12209.48s -> 12212.09s]  It was the only thing I could do.
[12213.77s -> 12215.85s]  So yes, I am a monster.
[12217.26s -> 12221.66s]  But this one horrible thing has prevented me from having to take any more life.
[12222.73s -> 12227.76s]  I would choose that again and again.
[12227.76s -> 12230.64s]  I can't live with any more death than I already do.
[12230.64s -> 12234.83s]  I've made peace with it.
[12235.39s -> 12238.14s]  The choice is yours if you can too.
[12238.70s -> 12240.92s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[12241.56s -> 12251.98s]  Ending four of five?
[12251.98s -> 12253.72s]  Wouldn't that have been three?
[12253.72s -> 12255.16s]  Wait, have I done this four times?
[12255.16s -> 12261.39s]  All right, that was fun.
[12261.39s -> 12262.75s]  Oh, okay, I see.
[12262.75s -> 12267.26s]  You messed up the coin ending.
[12267.26s -> 12269.58s]  You need to get the coins and necklace from the apartment
[12269.58s -> 12273.37s]  then pick up two more coins from the drawer in the mortuary.
[12273.37s -> 12276.65s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[12276.65s -> 12279.39s]  All right, get the possessed ending.
[12280.25s -> 12281.53s]  No, I gotta go.
[12281.53s -> 12285.53s]  I'm hungry and I've been sitting here for a while.
[12285.53s -> 12289.61s]  I know it doesn't seem that long but I'm still dealing with some problems.
[12289.61s -> 12295.93s]  It's because you're scared.
[12298.72s -> 12299.68s]  This is great.
[12301.40s -> 12303.16s]  The scares were really interesting.
[12303.16s -> 12307.04s]  Turning the corner and just kind of seeing a person just standing there.
[12307.04s -> 12308.84s]  It's just weird.
[12308.84s -> 12311.21s]  It's creepy.
[12311.21s -> 12312.17s]  This is fun.
[12312.17s -> 12314.17s]  Mortuary assistant.
[12317.92s -> 12318.88s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[12318.88s -> 12323.58s]  Tomorrow we're going to play Two Point Campus and maybe something else.
[12323.58s -> 12324.70s]  Pulted Lamb is out too, right?
[12324.70s -> 12325.58s]  Maybe I'll do that.
[12325.58s -> 12330.72s]  Two Point Campus is going to be sponsored
[12330.72s -> 12333.52s]  and I'm thinking about playing it so that's awesome.
[12333.52s -> 12336.68s]  The sponsor streams have been amazing by the way.
[12336.68s -> 12338.92s]  It's just stuff that I want to play.
[12338.92s -> 12340.36s]  Stuff that I'm really interested in playing.
[12341.40s -> 12344.22s]  I'm already interested so that's been great.
[12344.54s -> 12348.75s]  Pulted Lamb is not sponsored.
[12348.75s -> 12349.87s]  Yeah, I would just be playing it.
[12349.87s -> 12355.82s]  So I'm really happy about it so far.
[12355.82s -> 12358.75s]  I hope the sponsor streams have been good.
[12359.71s -> 12363.71s]  You know, I obviously want to play games that people would probably want to watch.
[12364.27s -> 12367.92s]  Pulted Lamb is a 10 out of 10.
[12373.63s -> 12374.91s]  Maybe I'll open with that.
[12374.91s -> 12379.13s]  Play that for like two or three hours and then do Two Point Campus for a few hours.
[12379.13s -> 12380.86s]  We'll figure it out.
[12380.86s -> 12385.26s]  The sponsor streams feel like a normal stream.
[12385.26s -> 12388.09s]  That's really what I'm looking for.
[12394.84s -> 12395.32s]  All right, cool.
[12396.51s -> 12397.63s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[12397.71s -> 12400.65s]  I'm going to start probably around like 2?
[12400.65s -> 12402.75s]  2 PM? 3 PM?
[12402.75s -> 12409.12s]  We'll make it 3 just in case.
[12409.12s -> 12410.56s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[12410.56s -> 12412.32s]  The Call of Duty tournament was really fun.
[12412.32s -> 12414.11s]  It's cool to hang out.
[12414.11s -> 12416.04s]  Play with Myth.
[12416.04s -> 12419.31s]  It's like, who knows?
[12419.31s -> 12421.39s]  I want to get these guys over to multiverses.
[12421.39s -> 12422.03s]  You know what I mean?
[12422.03s -> 12424.35s]  It's like, who played multiverses the other day?
[12424.35s -> 12425.31s]  Yesterday or whatever.
[12425.31s -> 12437.87s]  I love that game.
[12437.87s -> 12439.31s]  Let's play the game I'm good at.
[12446.68s -> 12447.72s]  All right, let's see you tomorrow.
[12447.72s -> 12451.20s]  Thanks again.
[12451.20s -> 12455.82s]  If you're still here from Connor.
[12455.82s -> 12456.54s]  A little bit late.
[12456.54s -> 12467.08s]  Started late though.
[12467.08s -> 12469.88s]  Green Screen Part 2 is going to be on Sunday.
[12469.88s -> 12476.52s]  That'll be the last real stream that you see here until baseball.
[12476.52s -> 12483.77s]  Because we're probably going to do just a little hangout session before baseball.
[12483.77s -> 12484.89s]  Kind of like Dollhouse.
[12484.89s -> 12491.47s]  I'm not going to be giving that much info because it's not as elaborate as Dollhouse was.
[12491.47s -> 12494.67s]  Where you need to know about the game being played in the background.
[12494.67s -> 12497.93s]  I had to kind of explain that before the stream.
[12497.93s -> 12500.44s]  But we'll hang out.
[12500.44s -> 12501.32s]  I'll talk about it.
[12501.32s -> 12502.44s]  Try to hype it up a little bit.
[12502.44s -> 12509.07s]  This is not the right music by the way.
[12509.07s -> 12510.59s]  This music is scary.
[12510.59s -> 12515.87s]  You need to explain the rules of baseball to chat.
[12515.87s -> 12523.45s]  August 19th.
[12523.45s -> 12525.37s]  430 p.m. Pacific.
[12525.37s -> 12526.32s]  Be here.
[12526.32s -> 12530.44s]  The German Baseball Association.
[12530.44s -> 12533.55s]  That's in the middle of the season so.
[12533.55s -> 12539.08s]  Good night guys.
[12539.08s -> 12540.25s]  Call your mother.
[12540.25s -> 12541.63s]  Take care of yourselves.
[12541.63s -> 12542.67s]  Have a great day.
[12542.67s -> 12543.92s]  Have a great night.
[12543.92s -> 12545.39s]  And goodbye.
