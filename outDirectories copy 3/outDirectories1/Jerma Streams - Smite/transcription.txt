[6.01s -> 15.70s]  Hello? Hello? Sorry, I'm late. Very late.
[16.90s -> 22.89s]  I had fucking car trouble. I had trouble with the car.
[24.26s -> 28.34s]  Oh, okay, okay. Therefore, all of your- all of your crimes are resolved.
[28.34s -> 31.62s]  Okay, all of the- that's fine. Yeah, I know what that's like.
[32.50s -> 38.50s]  Dude, what the fuck? It's my sister's birthday. You're here an hour late?
[38.50s -> 40.42s]  We've already did the cake and the candles and shit.
[41.22s -> 44.44s]  I had fucking trouble with the car, dude. I had car trouble.
[45.34s -> 47.90s]  Oh, yeah, all right. All right, man. Man, do you need anything?
[47.90s -> 49.74s]  You want water? You want like a soda or something? Are you good?
[50.38s -> 50.86s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[61.13s -> 66.44s]  It's time to play Destiny 2. Never gonna play Destiny 2.
[67.96s -> 70.12s]  Mark that and put a stamp on it.
[70.68s -> 74.20s]  I'm sorry, I have to tell you, I'm never gonna play that game. Ever.
[76.12s -> 79.64s]  Ever. I'm sorry, and I'm gonna make somebody really upset by saying that
[79.64s -> 81.64s]  I'm never going to play Destiny 2.
[85.37s -> 88.94s]  Now, about a year or two ago, if you had said,
[88.94s -> 93.34s]  Hey, Smite Thursdays, I would have said the same exact sentence.
[94.86s -> 97.90s]  I'm never gonna play fucking Smite on stream. Why the hell would I do that?
[98.62s -> 102.97s]  But here we are. So never listen to anything I say.
[103.69s -> 109.37s]  Everything I say is wrong. Incorrect. Did I tweet this? I did.
[116.62s -> 122.97s]  I figured, I don't know. I've played it recently. I think it's fun.
[123.77s -> 128.50s]  Somebody in chat, people in chat were saying to play it and I was like,
[128.50s -> 130.26s]  All right, yeah, let's do Smite Thursdays.
[132.71s -> 135.67s]  It's obviously subject to change, as per our agreement.
[136.71s -> 140.39s]  You know, Smite Thursdays may be on Friday, Saturday, Monday or Tuesday.
[141.03s -> 145.32s]  Smite Thursdays also might never come back ever again.
[146.12s -> 148.68s]  Depending on community sentiment.
[150.09s -> 151.37s]  But yes, Smite Thursdays.
[154.23s -> 163.43s]  Oh, but Andy. I was waiting to see what people were gonna do about this.
[167.91s -> 171.27s]  I wonder if this is gonna be the most toxic chat in 2021.
[171.99s -> 177.72s]  Stop being so toxic, okay? I wanted to play this game, so I'm playing it.
[178.36s -> 181.32s]  Isn't that what you what I'm supposed to be doing as a live streamer?
[182.30s -> 184.06s]  I want to do something, so I'm gonna do it.
[184.70s -> 187.82s]  And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. You understand?
[187.82s -> 191.74s]  Karma hates mods. What happened? What'd I do?
[191.74s -> 193.34s]  Oh, I'm sorry. Right. This stream.
[194.87s -> 197.59s]  This stream is me hating mods. That's right. Sorry.
[198.23s -> 204.70s]  What's your favorite class? Oh, I mean, I got a few.
[205.50s -> 210.71s]  But I have really bad performance anxiety whenever I play something like this.
[211.67s -> 212.95s]  Hearthstone's a really good example.
[214.55s -> 219.99s]  I have come in first place in Battlegrounds, I believe over like 150 times.
[221.29s -> 224.57s]  I was at my rank was like five or six thousand last season.
[225.37s -> 229.13s]  If I were to turn that on right now, I would be like, I don't know what to do.
[229.13s -> 230.25s]  I don't know. I would fuck up everything.
[230.25s -> 231.77s]  You guys watched it. You guys saw me do that.
[232.41s -> 238.57s]  Like, I could actually play that game, but I can't in front of people.
[240.94s -> 243.50s]  Off camera? I can play this game pretty well.
[243.50s -> 245.42s]  I wouldn't say very well, but pretty well.
[246.71s -> 248.15s]  I'm gonna forget what the buttons are.
[248.87s -> 251.51s]  I don't know why this happens to me. I don't understand it.
[253.16s -> 257.70s]  I haven't played Hearthstone in probably three or four months, maybe five months.
[258.42s -> 260.42s]  Not since the last Battlegrounds season.
[261.30s -> 265.94s]  Use an Xbox controller. No, I play on PC.
[265.94s -> 267.14s]  I'm playing on the computer.
[267.78s -> 274.15s]  Nobody wants to see you play Smite. Nobody.
[275.18s -> 278.62s]  Well, I'm sorry, but there's at least 10 people in pre-stream chat
[278.62s -> 282.86s]  that have been saying play Smite every pre-stream for the last six years.
[283.42s -> 285.74s]  So there are people that want to see it. I know them.
[295.38s -> 296.18s]  Smite Tuber.
[297.26s -> 299.10s]  Well, I think we can get started.
[300.30s -> 305.08s]  We can play. I want to make sure I can see things, though.
[305.08s -> 306.20s]  Hold on just a moment.
[308.07s -> 310.39s]  Where's my info? Where's my info?
[311.03s -> 312.39s]  There it is.
[314.70s -> 319.02s]  Because it's been a while, I do want to make sure that I get my brain
[319.66s -> 321.58s]  recombobulated into the world of Smite.
[322.22s -> 329.11s]  And what better way to do that than to watch a tutorial on a god tutorial, potentially?
[329.11s -> 330.31s]  I know there's a lot of them that exist.
[331.29s -> 331.93s]  I found one.
[333.26s -> 334.46s]  I'm really into the god Anubis.
[335.26s -> 337.64s]  I think it's a cool god, but I haven't played it in a while.
[337.64s -> 344.73s]  So I looked up a guide and I'm just going to try to get back into this world here.
[348.52s -> 349.72s]  Let's go ahead and watch it.
[349.72s -> 355.51s]  Just to refresh my memory, it's been a while.
[357.78s -> 367.16s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[367.16s -> 369.48s]  Jerma here with Smite Sunday.
[369.48s -> 371.32s]  Welcome to the first Smite Sunday on this channel.
[371.32s -> 371.88s]  Wait, what?
[371.88s -> 375.72s]  Where I break down a god or I show you a good gameplay and talk about it potentially.
[375.72s -> 375.88s]  What?
[375.88s -> 377.00s]  Or I do a live commentary.
[377.00s -> 380.28s]  But today is going to be a god breakdown.
[380.28s -> 382.04s]  I don't know, it's Smite Thursday.
[382.04s -> 382.68s]  All right, I'm going to be quiet.
[382.68s -> 384.78s]  The god of the dead.
[384.78s -> 389.50s]  And the reason why I'm picking Anubis first to do sort of a god breakdown and sort of small
[389.50s -> 393.66s]  tutorial video is because Anubis is one of those characters in this game
[393.66s -> 395.50s]  that he's not a free god.
[395.50s -> 396.78s]  He's not one of the free gods.
[396.78s -> 400.54s]  When you install the same joke, this wasn't a joke.
[400.54s -> 403.90s]  I actually did this for like three weeks completely incorrectly.
[403.90s -> 407.26s]  I was one of these people that I first downloaded this game.
[407.26s -> 409.66s]  I said, oh my God, Anubis, the god of the dead.
[409.66s -> 410.62s]  Oh my God, I get this guy.
[410.62s -> 411.50s]  I got to play with him and see.
[411.50s -> 412.46s]  He's so cool.
[412.46s -> 413.74s]  And I would just get trashed on.
[413.74s -> 417.90s]  And that's because Anubis is one of the most damaging gods in the game,
[417.90s -> 422.62s]  but he also dies incredibly easily and incredibly quickly.
[422.70s -> 425.98s]  So I figured because of my early struggles with Anubis,
[425.98s -> 428.22s]  I figured it would be a good one to start with.
[428.22s -> 431.66s]  Anubis, the god of the dead, the Egyptian lord of destruction.
[431.66s -> 433.26s]  What happened to your sexy voice?
[433.98s -> 436.04s]  I stopped trying so hard.
[436.04s -> 440.36s]  So instead of reading off of the wiki page and telling you all the damage numbers,
[440.36s -> 443.32s]  which are very, very easy to find on the internet,
[443.32s -> 446.52s]  I'm just going to tell you what the moves do and when you should be utilizing them.
[446.52s -> 447.24s]  What do the moves do?
[447.24s -> 447.72s]  How do I do that?
[447.72s -> 449.72s]  Not using them in different situations.
[449.72s -> 451.40s]  So we're going to talk about his number one,
[451.40s -> 452.76s]  which is Plague of Locus.
[452.76s -> 454.92s]  It's on the one key skill key number one.
[454.92s -> 461.08s]  And upon activation, Anubis will stand still and launch out a bunch of bugs at people in a cone.
[461.08s -> 462.04s]  Kind of disgusting.
[462.04s -> 463.40s]  It lasts for three seconds.
[463.40s -> 466.28s]  This didn't exist back then, guys.
[466.28s -> 468.52s]  So when should you use this move?
[468.52s -> 473.16s]  Now, I would typically say that this should be part of this smite beta from 2013.
[473.16s -> 474.92s]  I'll get into that in a few minutes.
[474.92s -> 476.84s]  But they didn't have half the features that are in the game.
[476.84s -> 481.08s]  Although it does a ton of damage, you won't really be using this early game.
[481.08s -> 482.52s]  And here's why.
[482.52s -> 485.08s]  Anubis does not have any escapes.
[485.08s -> 488.20s]  And if you don't know what an escape is in this game, it's a jump.
[488.20s -> 488.68s]  It's a dash.
[488.68s -> 489.80s]  Why is he so normal?
[489.80s -> 493.56s]  It's really any way to distance yourself from another god or from another player.
[493.56s -> 497.80s]  So trying to utilize a move like this, when you have to stand completely still,
[497.80s -> 499.00s]  you're just going to get destroyed behind the other lane.
[499.00s -> 499.64s]  What about Dexter?
[499.64s -> 500.92s]  Like, was he pretending to be a normal guy?
[500.92s -> 503.40s]  In a situation like this, you were level one, level two,
[503.40s -> 505.48s]  would have been a very, very, very early game.
[505.48s -> 508.28s]  You're up in the lane with a buddy of yours, you're playing Conquest.
[508.36s -> 511.72s]  And you have this move, you go up and you use it on a minion wave.
[511.72s -> 513.72s]  And you're standing still, the other team sees you.
[513.72s -> 514.84s]  They know you're Anubis.
[514.84s -> 516.84s]  They know you cannot get away.
[516.84s -> 518.52s]  So they jump on top of you.
[518.52s -> 519.88s]  You got to play it safe.
[519.88s -> 523.08s]  And standing still up at level two in a minion wave.
[523.08s -> 524.20s]  I can't watch this anymore.
[525.08s -> 525.88s]  This is a lot.
[527.00s -> 529.05s]  Seven more minutes in this video.
[529.05s -> 529.37s]  Seven.
[530.55s -> 533.91s]  You need to use your three early game for Anubis, I would say.
[533.91s -> 535.51s]  But we'll get into that when we get to that.
[535.51s -> 537.59s]  Also, that kind of leads me to another point.
[537.59s -> 538.95s]  Oh, that was a good grab.
[538.95s -> 539.83s]  That was a good grab.
[539.83s -> 541.43s]  Standing still is bad.
[541.43s -> 542.15s]  It's very bad.
[542.15s -> 544.87s]  If you stand still and do it at times two speed, fine.
[544.87s -> 550.58s]  This game, because everything is a skillshot.
[550.58s -> 551.78s]  Well, most of the things in this game are skillshots.
[551.78s -> 552.90s]  There's so many stuns, there's so many slows.
[552.90s -> 554.74s]  There's so many people that will be able to hit you with all of their moves.
[554.74s -> 555.46s]  You don't want to be standing still.
[555.46s -> 557.78s]  So that's another reason why the number one is not the best choice early.
[557.78s -> 560.10s]  So moving on, let's talk about his two, which is arguably his best move.
[560.10s -> 561.22s]  And that move is called Mummify.
[561.22s -> 562.90s]  And basically, this is just a stun that you can do very, very frequently.
[562.90s -> 564.90s]  And it wraps up anybody you hit with it for a maximum of two seconds.
[564.90s -> 566.50s]  This is an offensive and defensive move.
[566.50s -> 578.82s]  This is just like when your buddy is explaining the game to you, and they're really happy,
[578.82s -> 581.30s]  and they really, really badly want you to download it.
[582.50s -> 583.14s]  This is what I hear.
[596.66s -> 598.34s]  Move and it slows people, you can get a lot more utility out of this.
[598.34s -> 600.98s]  You don't have to stand still to use it and a little bit better in team composition situations
[600.98s -> 604.50s]  where Ben Shapiro because of the slow before I go on any further.
[604.50s -> 605.30s]  Talk about his number four is ultimate.
[605.30s -> 607.86s]  We're going to talk about what I said previously, and it is the non ultimate combo.
[607.86s -> 609.94s]  This is really what you should be trying to accomplish when your ultimate ability is on
[609.94s -> 614.66s]  cooldown and you instantly place your grasping hands underneath them.
[614.66s -> 616.66s]  And while they're still wrapped up getting them in the cone of your locust swarm, you
[616.66s -> 617.46s]  do one instantly as well.
[617.46s -> 617.94s]  You're close enough.
[617.94s -> 618.98s]  That's assuming you're close enough.
[618.98s -> 621.30s]  It takes some practice, but late game, you can really instantly kill people with this.
[622.10s -> 622.82s]  I got to turn it off.
[622.82s -> 623.38s]  It's too much.
[623.38s -> 624.26s]  You can just place your three mummify.
[624.26s -> 624.74s]  It's too much.
[624.74s -> 625.22s]  It's too much.
[625.22s -> 625.78s]  It's too much.
[626.34s -> 630.39s]  Let's see what it is in slow mo 720p.
[630.39s -> 631.11s]  What year is it?
[633.18s -> 638.54s]  That's one of the best things to do as a new person.
[638.54s -> 641.18s]  Hey, those of you guys that have heard me do this before where I go,
[641.18s -> 644.54s]  I don't want and people give me question marks.
[644.54s -> 645.10s]  Listen up.
[645.10s -> 661.21s]  And one of the things about this is if you do not kill the person,
[661.21s -> 676.49s]  let's say you do this, this non ultimate combo, you wrap the person up, bang, bang,
[676.49s -> 686.26s]  do both those moves and you don't kill them.
[686.26s -> 687.94s]  It really is a drunk person.
[689.35s -> 703.46s]  There ain't a whole lot left for you to do besides turn around and run away
[703.46s -> 710.02s]  or try to auto attack them to death.
[716.02s -> 718.18s]  I should have just uploaded the video like this.
[718.18s -> 720.82s]  I feel like more people would have liked it and remembered it more fondly.
[738.20s -> 739.96s]  Finally, we're going to talk about his ultimate ability,
[739.96s -> 742.12s]  which is very, very self-explanatory.
[742.12s -> 743.24s]  I'm not going to spend that much time.
[743.24s -> 743.48s]  All right.
[743.48s -> 744.68s]  We're not going to spend any time actually.
[744.68s -> 745.16s]  I'm going to skip.
[745.80s -> 750.44s]  So you can put people in a very, very large false sense of security landing your two.
[750.44s -> 753.08s]  You're in the jungle and you got like an area here, guys.
[753.08s -> 756.28s]  I think I've covered most of the things I want to cover with an Anubis.
[756.28s -> 759.56s]  And the next God will probably be Ares for Smite Sunday.
[759.56s -> 760.92s]  I'm going to break down Ares.
[760.92s -> 763.48s]  I'm going to talk about why he's my favorite God in the game.
[763.48s -> 766.28s]  Yes, Ares is my favorite God in the game at this point.
[766.28s -> 769.40s]  It used to be an Anubis that used to be Loki, but now it is Ares.
[769.40s -> 770.76s]  And we're going to talk about him next week.
[770.76s -> 773.00s]  Going to break down his moves, going to break down how I play him
[773.00s -> 774.92s]  and some of the things you should be doing as Ares.
[775.16s -> 777.16s]  And that's going to be next Smite Sunday.
[777.16s -> 778.20s]  So thanks for tuning in, guys.
[778.20s -> 779.32s]  I really do appreciate it.
[779.32s -> 780.76s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[780.76s -> 783.16s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[784.44s -> 786.92s]  I did that two more times and never did it again.
[786.92s -> 791.30s]  It was the lowest viewed thing I ever made on my channel.
[791.30s -> 793.46s]  Everybody, nobody watched it.
[793.46s -> 795.19s]  I did it two more times.
[795.19s -> 799.82s]  I was, in my mind, I was going to do every single God in the game
[799.82s -> 805.51s]  and Smite was going to be a new secondary game next to Team Fortress.
[805.51s -> 806.55s]  It was like, holy shit, man.
[806.55s -> 809.99s]  I'm going to have like TF2 and I'll have like Smite content.
[809.99s -> 812.41s]  I'll be like a TF2 Smite guy.
[812.41s -> 815.69s]  I made three videos on it and it was like I'm never doing that again.
[815.69s -> 816.25s]  Nobody liked it.
[816.25s -> 822.14s]  Everybody, nobody watched it.
[822.14s -> 824.54s]  So, yeah, I think I know how to play Anubis now.
[824.54s -> 829.62s]  Okay, cool.
[829.62s -> 831.16s]  Where's the audio?
[834.26s -> 837.24s]  Uh, yeah, Ares, this is, um, yeah, what the fuck?
[837.24s -> 838.28s]  The Smite guy is back.
[838.28s -> 838.92s]  Yeah, I'm back.
[840.10s -> 842.66s]  I took a, I took a seven-year vacation.
[842.66s -> 846.89s]  I'm back, eight-year vacation.
[846.89s -> 847.93s]  Now I'm the sus guy.
[847.93s -> 849.21s]  I never was the sus guy.
[849.21s -> 851.93s]  That implies that I made Among Us videos.
[851.93s -> 854.97s]  I didn't.
[854.97s -> 856.81s]  Uh, so here's one thing you need to know about Smite.
[856.81s -> 858.81s]  There's only one thing you have to really know.
[858.81s -> 866.23s]  And that is, uh, they, they added, um, they added Ninja Turtles.
[869.78s -> 871.30s]  All the Ninja Turtles are in the game.
[872.92s -> 877.22s]  And, um, Airbender is in this game, too.
[877.94s -> 878.82s]  Legend of Airbender?
[878.82s -> 880.74s]  What's the fucking goddamn name of that show?
[880.74s -> 883.40s]  Can I, don't tell me what it is.
[883.40s -> 884.28s]  Oh, shit.
[886.46s -> 889.16s]  Hold on.
[889.16s -> 890.76s]  Aang, the last Airbender?
[890.76s -> 892.60s]  Avatar, the last Airbun-bun.
[893.64s -> 895.40s]  Avatar, the last Bundy.
[895.40s -> 896.76s]  It's Al Bundy's son.
[899.14s -> 899.86s]  Uh, I, hold on.
[899.86s -> 902.42s]  I have to, I have to shut this off for a second.
[902.42s -> 904.78s]  Because I have to figure out how to fucking make it so nobody can, like.
[905.66s -> 906.70s]  I have an invite.
[906.70s -> 908.38s]  Oh, what the fuck did I, what have I done?
[909.82s -> 911.50s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[911.50s -> 912.22s]  Hold on a minute.
[912.22s -> 913.18s]  I thought I did this.
[913.18s -> 914.74s]  What the fuck?
[914.74s -> 916.74s]  No, stop friend requesting me.
[916.74s -> 917.70s]  How do I turn this off?
[918.42s -> 918.98s]  Stop it.
[922.71s -> 924.07s]  No, I don't know how to turn this off.
[925.91s -> 926.41s]  Oh.
[929.74s -> 931.18s]  Can I not turn this off?
[932.17s -> 934.89s]  Am I gonna get, like, where is it?
[934.89s -> 935.39s]  Profile.
[935.93s -> 936.81s]  Private profile.
[936.81s -> 937.69s]  Private profile.
[937.69s -> 942.17s]  Private profile.
[942.17s -> 943.13s]  Private profile.
[943.13s -> 943.85s]  Account.
[943.85s -> 944.49s]  Private.
[944.49s -> 945.21s]  How do I do this?
[945.85s -> 947.45s]  Somebody please tell me how to do this.
[947.45s -> 949.79s]  How do I do it?
[949.79s -> 954.17s]  How do I actually do this?
[954.17s -> 957.44s]  I can't find it.
[958.00s -> 962.38s]  Turn it off?
[962.94s -> 966.20s]  From a new house flipper DLC.
[966.20s -> 967.88s]  No, that's not what I asked.
[967.88s -> 969.32s]  How do I, what, how do I turn this off?
[970.20s -> 971.96s]  Write slash DND in chat.
[971.96s -> 974.20s]  How you doing?
[974.20s -> 977.69s]  Am I being lied to?
[982.52s -> 984.04s]  You're now in DND.
[984.04s -> 986.51s]  But how do I make it so people can't do that?
[986.51s -> 987.07s]  What the fuck?
[987.71s -> 989.39s]  Option settings, privacy profile, sus.
[989.39s -> 989.87s]  Fuck.
[989.87s -> 990.43s]  God damn it.
[990.43s -> 993.90s]  Why did I read that?
[993.90s -> 994.78s]  All right.
[994.78s -> 995.66s]  You guys ready?
[995.66s -> 998.09s]  Put a sensor bar over your name.
[998.09s -> 1000.73s]  It's, I don't, I made a new account specifically
[1000.73s -> 1003.85s]  because I knew that was gonna happen.
[1003.85s -> 1004.41s]  Go to view.
[1004.41s -> 1005.47s]  Somebody's got it.
[1005.47s -> 1007.31s]  Go to view friends and click the little down arrow
[1007.31s -> 1008.75s]  and press do not disturb.
[1008.75s -> 1014.19s]  Can I, can I, like, make myself private?
[1014.19s -> 1014.43s]  All right.
[1014.43s -> 1015.47s]  I'm just gonna get, you know what?
[1015.47s -> 1016.59s]  I'm just gonna, I gotta practice.
[1018.49s -> 1022.17s]  I gotta practice.
[1022.17s -> 1023.69s]  Profile bar in the top right corner.
[1023.69s -> 1025.37s]  I don't want you to fucking see this shit.
[1025.37s -> 1028.68s]  Oh, I got a Royale coming my way.
[1028.68s -> 1032.68s]  That was my Fortnite name.
[1032.68s -> 1034.33s]  Okay.
[1034.33s -> 1037.23s]  Um, I think I did it.
[1037.23s -> 1037.95s]  I think I'm fine.
[1037.95s -> 1041.53s]  Whatever.
[1041.53s -> 1043.69s]  Yeah, I was gonna play Fortnite for like an hour
[1043.69s -> 1046.40s]  and I was like, that's a fun name.
[1046.40s -> 1047.44s]  All right, play.
[1047.44s -> 1048.00s]  You guys ready?
[1048.56s -> 1052.08s]  I just gotta, I gotta get back in the swing of things.
[1052.08s -> 1054.16s]  I gotta adjust my chair too.
[1054.16s -> 1057.60s]  This is a chill stream.
[1057.60s -> 1059.36s]  I wanna chill and play this game.
[1060.24s -> 1063.76s]  I'm only level five so I can't do anything interesting.
[1063.76s -> 1067.10s]  Go to profile and click delete.
[1067.10s -> 1067.34s]  All right.
[1067.34s -> 1070.22s]  So this is like the ultimate stream sniper game
[1070.22s -> 1073.82s]  because it's just a countdown and when it gets to zero,
[1073.82s -> 1075.34s]  it just takes a pool of the people there.
[1075.34s -> 1078.32s]  So like, I can't.
[1078.32s -> 1082.64s]  I was gonna pre-record myself clicking this and waiting
[1082.64s -> 1084.88s]  and then just like, like I didn't Hearthstone that time
[1084.88s -> 1086.84s]  but I ran out of time.
[1086.84s -> 1089.16s]  So like, how do I make it so the least amount of people
[1089.16s -> 1091.24s]  can like, can spawn camp me?
[1091.24s -> 1092.88s]  Turn on streamer mode.
[1092.88s -> 1096.96s]  There's a streamer mode?
[1096.96s -> 1099.79s]  Where's the streamer mode?
[1099.79s -> 1100.43s]  What?
[1100.43s -> 1105.28s]  Did I not turn this on?
[1105.28s -> 1105.76s]  Where is it?
[1105.76s -> 1106.56s]  It's in the settings?
[1106.56s -> 1107.68s]  No, you fucking liars.
[1107.68s -> 1109.20s]  There's no way it's in here.
[1109.20s -> 1110.40s]  Look at the goddamn options.
[1110.40s -> 1111.04s]  Holy shit.
[1111.04s -> 1112.16s]  I already did.
[1113.69s -> 1114.09s]  Settings.
[1116.44s -> 1117.08s]  Spectator.
[1117.95s -> 1119.55s]  Friendly team.
[1119.55s -> 1120.59s]  Key bindings.
[1120.59s -> 1121.07s]  Interface.
[1123.37s -> 1126.17s]  Options, profile, privacy, streamer mode.
[1126.17s -> 1129.21s]  Options, profile, privacy mode.
[1129.21s -> 1135.84s]  Options, profile, profile, privacy mode.
[1138.00s -> 1138.72s]  That's not here.
[1142.91s -> 1143.71s]  Privacy mode.
[1147.39s -> 1148.27s]  This is a lie.
[1148.27s -> 1149.47s]  I'm just fucking queuing up.
[1149.47s -> 1150.11s]  I don't even care.
[1150.11s -> 1152.75s]  And I look, I'm not gonna tell you guys when I queue up.
[1152.75s -> 1155.18s]  No one's gonna fucking know when I do that.
[1155.18s -> 1157.63s]  I'm not gonna tell you what I queued up for either.
[1157.63s -> 1159.31s]  Well, look at that.
[1159.31s -> 1160.03s]  How does that sound?
[1166.40s -> 1168.24s]  I could have queued up for anything.
[1168.24s -> 1171.13s]  What am I gonna, what am I playing?
[1171.13s -> 1171.61s]  Who knows?
[1176.00s -> 1176.72s]  Windows G.
[1176.72s -> 1178.24s]  That's like the Windows gamer mode.
[1178.24s -> 1180.88s]  That's not accurate.
[1180.88s -> 1182.96s]  Oh, it's a Windows G.
[1182.96s -> 1184.72s]  By the way, I'm gonna show you guys.
[1184.72s -> 1186.88s]  Hey, hey, queues up.
[1186.88s -> 1188.16s]  Okay, queues up.
[1188.72s -> 1190.64s]  This is the point where everybody that you know
[1190.64s -> 1192.80s]  that plays this game fucking sprints to the bathroom
[1192.80s -> 1194.46s]  after hitting accept.
[1194.46s -> 1195.90s]  You can like hear them over the microphone.
[1195.90s -> 1203.10s]  Just like, okay, queues up.
[1203.10s -> 1206.89s]  I don't want you guys to know what I did.
[1207.53s -> 1211.98s]  All right, here we go.
[1211.98s -> 1212.46s]  What did I pay?
[1212.46s -> 1213.66s]  All right, who do I want to play with first?
[1213.66s -> 1216.91s]  This is like, it's a warm-up game.
[1216.91s -> 1218.35s]  This is, this is arena.
[1218.35s -> 1224.68s]  Audio is really fucking low.
[1224.68s -> 1227.23s]  Who should I play with?
[1227.23s -> 1227.87s]  The frog?
[1227.87s -> 1228.83s]  That's a skin, man.
[1228.83s -> 1230.35s]  That's like a $20 skin or something.
[1230.35s -> 1230.91s]  I don't have that.
[1233.05s -> 1233.69s]  Random?
[1233.69s -> 1234.81s]  No, I can't do that.
[1234.81s -> 1236.89s]  I don't know how half these guys even work.
[1236.89s -> 1238.65s]  I've played like seven characters.
[1239.21s -> 1245.88s]  No, we're, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1245.88s -> 1246.60s]  I know how to play.
[1246.60s -> 1248.28s]  We need a fucking guardian is what we need.
[1248.28s -> 1248.92s]  Oh, we got one.
[1248.92s -> 1249.42s]  All right.
[1249.80s -> 1250.97s]  Should I play?
[1250.97s -> 1254.65s]  All right, we got, we got magic, magic, physical, physical.
[1254.65s -> 1255.21s]  We're good.
[1255.21s -> 1255.85s]  No, this is good.
[1256.41s -> 1257.79s]  I'm not, I don't know.
[1257.79s -> 1258.27s]  Anubis?
[1259.84s -> 1261.60s]  All right, yeah, because he asked.
[1261.60s -> 1263.44s]  Yeah, and I bought the skin even on the,
[1263.44s -> 1266.96s]  I bought a skin even on my dummy account, which is this one.
[1266.96s -> 1269.12s]  I bought two skins.
[1269.12s -> 1270.16s]  I love this character.
[1270.16s -> 1276.44s]  All right, do you guys want Stargazer or the Senko Sage?
[1276.44s -> 1276.94s]  Which one?
[1277.56s -> 1281.13s]  I need a few warm-up games.
[1281.13s -> 1286.44s]  All right, I've seen a lot of sages.
[1286.44s -> 1287.32s]  Boy, I got boosters.
[1287.88s -> 1290.56s]  Okay, everybody gets a voice pack.
[1290.56s -> 1294.11s]  I'm on it.
[1294.11s -> 1298.84s]  You got a furry skin.
[1300.64s -> 1302.08s]  Every character has a furry skin, okay?
[1303.02s -> 1305.36s]  Half the characters in this game are furries.
[1305.36s -> 1307.12s]  So what's wrong with you?
[1307.12s -> 1313.07s]  All right, we got, we got a level 10 Thanatos on the other team.
[1314.22s -> 1315.10s]  This is bad.
[1315.10s -> 1321.55s]  This is, this is one of you guys, isn't it?
[1321.55s -> 1322.67s]  You knew I was going to pick Anubis,
[1322.67s -> 1326.67s]  so you're just going to execute me over and over again.
[1326.67s -> 1328.91s]  All right, I got, I got to prove that I could play video games.
[1328.91s -> 1336.04s]  All right, let me prove it.
[1336.04s -> 1336.54s]  Okay.
[1337.56s -> 1343.56s]  One thing that I noticed, did they, did they delete boots from the game?
[1344.65s -> 1346.33s]  I remember you used to buy boots.
[1346.33s -> 1347.45s]  Did they fucking delete it?
[1348.01s -> 1348.51s]  Where is it?
[1349.07s -> 1356.00s]  So you're telling me that eight years later, they removed boots from the game.
[1356.00s -> 1358.96s]  So what do they, is it, is it, do you, does everybody run the same speed?
[1358.96s -> 1360.48s]  No, I don't understand how that works.
[1360.48s -> 1367.30s]  All right, let me just fucking get my, oh, that's, I'm ready.
[1367.30s -> 1368.02s]  That's all I need to do.
[1370.38s -> 1375.42s]  Okay, so I have, this is arena.
[1376.06s -> 1378.86s]  And in arena, what you want to try to do, it's very important,
[1378.86s -> 1380.62s]  is stick together with your team.
[1381.50s -> 1386.11s]  One thing people do all the time in Smite is they break up too frequently.
[1386.75s -> 1388.82s]  These are the damage buffs over here.
[1389.54s -> 1391.70s]  Well, they're not, they're not all damage buffs.
[1391.70s -> 1392.50s]  Look at this guy over here.
[1392.50s -> 1393.62s]  Hi, my name is Ra.
[1394.58s -> 1395.14s]  Yeah, he's funny.
[1395.14s -> 1395.94s]  He's a funny character.
[1395.94s -> 1398.18s]  But you, you, you don't want to break up too much.
[1398.90s -> 1402.26s]  Be careful, stick together and utilize your abilities as a team.
[1406.74s -> 1407.38s]  Oh, what's that?
[1408.02s -> 1408.90s]  Oh, somebody got you.
[1413.23s -> 1416.61s]  As you see, what I did there is, I'm going to kill this meat.
[1417.78s -> 1418.98s]  Kill stealer.
[1418.98s -> 1427.06s]  Go away from me.
[1427.06s -> 1429.31s]  Go away from me.
[1429.31s -> 1430.59s]  What are you, are we a watcher?
[1430.59s -> 1431.23s]  Are you a sniper?
[1431.23s -> 1432.27s]  Are you stream sniping me?
[1432.83s -> 1439.60s]  Is this main channel material?
[1439.60s -> 1440.16s]  It is not.
[1442.05s -> 1442.29s]  All right.
[1442.29s -> 1443.33s]  What do I want to do?
[1443.33s -> 1444.29s]  Well, I want to cool down.
[1444.29s -> 1444.93s]  Chrono spin.
[1444.93s -> 1445.25s]  Let's go.
[1446.77s -> 1449.97s]  I did, oh, he doesn't finish, it doesn't finish item Andy.
[1451.06s -> 1451.46s]  Relax.
[1451.46s -> 1451.86s]  I got it.
[1452.42s -> 1459.14s]  Let's go.
[1460.03s -> 1460.51s]  Let's go.
[1460.51s -> 1462.11s]  All it takes is a minute and I get the fire.
[1462.11s -> 1462.75s]  I get it again.
[1463.39s -> 1471.06s]  Just give me a minute.
[1471.06s -> 1471.62s]  That's all I need.
[1472.26s -> 1475.15s]  Where are they going?
[1475.15s -> 1475.87s]  Oh, that's Tinnitus.
[1475.87s -> 1476.35s]  That's Tinnitus.
[1480.58s -> 1480.90s]  Help me.
[1480.90s -> 1481.46s]  Somebody help me.
[1484.40s -> 1485.68s]  Oh, that was pretty good bait.
[1486.40s -> 1486.80s]  I'm good.
[1493.63s -> 1494.83s]  Where your mic is on?
[1494.83s -> 1495.55s]  What are you talking about?
[1495.55s -> 1498.19s]  Speaking of killing sprees, we've got one coming up.
[1498.19s -> 1499.15s]  My mic is on?
[1499.95s -> 1502.56s]  To be honest, I don't think anyone's surprised.
[1502.56s -> 1502.80s]  Mike.
[1505.78s -> 1506.34s]  Where?
[1506.34s -> 1511.12s]  Are you Mike?
[1511.12s -> 1512.00s]  Turn your mic off?
[1512.00s -> 1512.40s]  I don't have it.
[1512.40s -> 1513.20s]  What do you mean my mic?
[1513.92s -> 1519.26s]  What shit is off?
[1525.34s -> 1526.46s]  No, you're talking about it.
[1527.26s -> 1527.98s]  Oh, you.
[1527.98s -> 1528.30s]  Okay.
[1528.86s -> 1529.82s]  I see what you're doing.
[1529.82s -> 1533.74s]  You're talking about like you guys are in the game and I'm an annoying guy.
[1533.74s -> 1534.06s]  Okay.
[1534.06s -> 1534.54s]  I get it.
[1553.39s -> 1553.87s]  All right.
[1553.87s -> 1554.83s]  You guys stop fucking with me.
[1554.83s -> 1555.87s]  I would have killed that guy.
[1555.87s -> 1556.51s]  Stop fucking with me.
[1558.59s -> 1559.55s]  I'm in arena.
[1559.55s -> 1560.19s]  What did that guy say?
[1560.19s -> 1561.31s]  You should stick to arena.
[1561.31s -> 1562.67s]  I'm playing arena right now.
[1563.31s -> 1568.70s]  All right.
[1568.70s -> 1569.18s]  I'm going to be quiet.
[1573.07s -> 1573.71s]  Jump.
[1573.71s -> 1577.89s]  There it is.
[1582.40s -> 1584.83s]  It's Mike Pro League.
[1584.83s -> 1585.71s]  Here we go.
[1585.71s -> 1588.35s]  I have no, we're just playing for fun.
[1588.35s -> 1590.11s]  This is a fun game, Andy.
[1590.11s -> 1590.35s]  Okay.
[1591.31s -> 1599.20s]  You want to see me jungle?
[1600.13s -> 1600.53s]  Okay.
[1600.53s -> 1602.61s]  We're going to do custom games, right?
[1603.57s -> 1608.13s]  If you want to see an absolute disaster, then you put me in the jungle,
[1608.13s -> 1609.65s]  but I need some pros on my team.
[1610.45s -> 1612.72s]  I need some people that really know what the fuck they're doing.
[1615.63s -> 1616.11s]  Oh shit.
[1616.11s -> 1616.67s]  Stop talking.
[1616.83s -> 1616.99s]  Okay.
[1616.99s -> 1617.63s]  I gotta stop talking.
[1620.37s -> 1620.61s]  All right.
[1620.61s -> 1622.53s]  I guess this is why I can't play games like this and scream.
[1622.53s -> 1624.85s]  I can't, I just talk and my brain doesn't play the game.
[1625.57s -> 1625.89s]  All right.
[1625.89s -> 1626.29s]  Quiet.
[1630.70s -> 1633.10s]  I get into like autopilot mode whenever I start talking.
[1638.35s -> 1639.95s]  I don't have two hemispheres in my brain.
[1639.95s -> 1640.83s]  I have one.
[1640.83s -> 1642.43s]  It's just one gigantic circle.
[1650.21s -> 1650.61s]  Get her.
[1650.61s -> 1651.01s]  Get her.
[1651.01s -> 1651.33s]  Get her.
[1659.07s -> 1659.47s]  Careful.
[1661.97s -> 1662.21s]  Hey.
[1662.93s -> 1663.25s]  Hey.
[1664.37s -> 1664.69s]  Hey.
[1666.42s -> 1666.74s]  Fuck.
[1666.74s -> 1667.14s]  I missed.
[1667.14s -> 1667.86s]  I'm so sorry.
[1667.86s -> 1669.14s]  I was trying to make a joke and I missed.
[1669.94s -> 1676.18s]  Oh, I hit the wrong button.
[1676.18s -> 1676.42s]  Shit.
[1678.22s -> 1679.74s]  Oh, give me that triple.
[1690.66s -> 1691.70s]  Oh, yeah.
[1694.18s -> 1695.06s]  You, you're a viewer.
[1695.06s -> 1695.86s]  I don't get out of here.
[1697.10s -> 1699.42s]  Remember everybody that's good that hurts me is a viewer.
[1700.22s -> 1701.22s]  Doesn't matter.
[1702.02s -> 1709.81s]  Ice.
[1711.09s -> 1711.73s]  Oh, come on.
[1711.73s -> 1712.21s]  Fuck that.
[1718.93s -> 1719.41s]  Where should I be?
[1720.05s -> 1720.85s]  No, stand in the way.
[1720.85s -> 1721.17s]  I got it.
[1722.45s -> 1722.91s]  All right.
[1722.91s -> 1723.23s]  Done that.
[1723.23s -> 1723.95s]  What the fuck happened?
[1724.11s -> 1724.59s]  What's going on?
[1725.31s -> 1727.60s]  What the fuck just happened?
[1729.04s -> 1730.48s]  What's the range on that motherfucker?
[1730.48s -> 1730.72s]  What?
[1730.72s -> 1732.48s]  I don't think anyone's surprised.
[1732.48s -> 1733.68s]  Trips for days.
[1734.48s -> 1736.96s]  A gift from my most loyal observers.
[1736.96s -> 1738.16s]  I must go all out.
[1739.42s -> 1739.82s]  Ego.
[1740.78s -> 1741.42s]  And that guy.
[1742.14s -> 1742.38s]  Oh.
[1743.39s -> 1744.75s]  Oh, let's use speed.
[1744.75s -> 1746.35s]  I know it's the worst thing in the game, but I don't care.
[1751.09s -> 1751.25s]  All right.
[1751.25s -> 1752.21s]  Who do I want to grab here?
[1756.77s -> 1757.65s]  Oh, shit.
[1757.65s -> 1758.13s]  Oh, God.
[1758.13s -> 1758.45s]  Oh, God.
[1758.45s -> 1759.33s]  This is where it's time to shine.
[1759.33s -> 1759.81s]  Time to shine.
[1759.81s -> 1760.29s]  This is where a new...
[1760.29s -> 1762.05s]  This is truly where a newbie shines.
[1766.48s -> 1767.12s]  We're still in this.
[1767.84s -> 1770.02s]  I don't know.
[1770.02s -> 1770.18s]  I just...
[1770.18s -> 1770.58s]  I hit four.
[1770.58s -> 1771.22s]  Why did it not go off?
[1771.78s -> 1776.21s]  What the fuck?
[1777.74s -> 1778.54s]  Hello?
[1778.54s -> 1779.02s]  Excuse me.
[1779.02s -> 1779.34s]  Why...
[1779.34s -> 1780.06s]  I'm pressing button.
[1780.06s -> 1781.34s]  What the fuck is happening?
[1781.34s -> 1781.58s]  What?
[1784.26s -> 1784.98s]  What is going on?
[1790.83s -> 1790.99s]  Yeah.
[1790.99s -> 1791.55s]  What the fuck?
[1796.02s -> 1798.02s]  I was pressing buttons and it didn't do anything.
[1798.02s -> 1798.58s]  That was weird.
[1804.46s -> 1804.70s]  All right.
[1804.70s -> 1805.50s]  Here we go.
[1805.50s -> 1811.18s]  You got silenced?
[1811.18s -> 1811.58s]  No, no, no.
[1811.58s -> 1812.22s]  It was after that.
[1812.78s -> 1816.08s]  They added silences to the game.
[1816.08s -> 1816.80s]  Oh, now it's...
[1816.80s -> 1817.68s]  Now it's really gone.
[1817.68s -> 1818.48s]  Completely off the rails.
[1820.40s -> 1820.88s]  No, no.
[1820.88s -> 1821.20s]  I'm not...
[1821.20s -> 1821.92s]  I don't like it anymore.
[1830.02s -> 1831.14s]  Your mic is on.
[1831.14s -> 1831.70s]  Stop.
[1831.70s -> 1832.02s]  All right.
[1832.02s -> 1833.54s]  I need to pay attention because when I pay attention,
[1833.54s -> 1834.34s]  that's when shit happens.
[1834.34s -> 1834.58s]  Ready?
[1834.58s -> 1835.06s]  I'll show you.
[1839.17s -> 1840.05s]  After that.
[1840.05s -> 1850.77s]  There's too many people on the team that are good.
[1853.33s -> 1853.73s]  Oops.
[1854.45s -> 1858.50s]  I just completely missed.
[1858.50s -> 1859.06s]  This is warm.
[1859.06s -> 1860.98s]  It's the first game I've played in like three years.
[1860.98s -> 1861.46s]  Relax.
[1862.18s -> 1869.41s]  I'm already running fast.
[1869.41s -> 1870.45s]  Wait, that was an enemy, wasn't it?
[1871.25s -> 1879.78s]  Why would I play Anubis like for the first game on stream?
[1880.42s -> 1882.05s]  He like sucks.
[1882.69s -> 1884.69s]  Why would I play this guy?
[1884.69s -> 1885.01s]  No.
[1885.01s -> 1885.41s]  Shut up.
[1885.41s -> 1886.13s]  He's good.
[1886.13s -> 1887.17s]  He's my favorite character.
[1901.66s -> 1903.10s]  Your only tank is AFK?
[1905.26s -> 1905.98s]  Oh, shit.
[1905.98s -> 1906.46s]  Oh, well.
[1907.02s -> 1909.86s]  Anyway, you're in Anubis main.
[1910.74s -> 1912.82s]  Now, I do the thing that we all do when we play games like this.
[1913.92s -> 1914.80s]  Like, you know what?
[1914.80s -> 1915.92s]  I love this character.
[1915.92s -> 1917.44s]  It's like my favorite character.
[1917.44s -> 1918.16s]  They're super fun.
[1918.16s -> 1918.88s]  They're super cool.
[1919.52s -> 1921.60s]  But anytime you lose with this kind of character,
[1922.48s -> 1924.40s]  it's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[1924.40s -> 1926.88s]  This character is a low tier garbage character.
[1926.88s -> 1928.64s]  And like, why do I play this character?
[1929.28s -> 1932.48s]  Oh, I don't play fucking Thor, right?
[1934.08s -> 1938.86s]  No, I play Anubis because he's like a C kind of D tier character.
[1939.50s -> 1940.22s]  He's awesome, man.
[1940.22s -> 1941.26s]  It's like I'm like different.
[1941.26s -> 1942.70s]  I play the game like differently than everybody else.
[1942.70s -> 1943.90s]  I don't play the meta.
[1943.90s -> 1947.84s]  And then when you lose with this character,
[1948.86s -> 1950.46s]  this character sucks.
[1950.46s -> 1953.63s]  And the only reason why you are losing is with this character
[1953.63s -> 1955.07s]  because this is a bad character.
[1956.38s -> 1959.50s]  And I've chosen to play it because I want to look like different.
[1959.50s -> 1960.46s]  That's what I do.
[1960.46s -> 1961.42s]  And you all do it, too.
[1961.42s -> 1961.98s]  Don't lie to me.
[1963.10s -> 1975.26s]  I'm actually not really doing that poorly.
[1979.39s -> 1980.75s]  Jerma is just built different.
[1981.39s -> 1982.59s]  And now I left the game.
[1982.59s -> 1984.19s]  Oh, this is low MMR, right?
[1985.68s -> 1988.24s]  In low MMR games and in every one of these MOBAs,
[1989.68s -> 1991.33s]  people just leave.
[1991.33s -> 1994.05s]  I forgot this low MMR arena.
[1994.93s -> 1996.69s]  What do I expect?
[2005.58s -> 2007.42s]  Oh, get him.
[2008.38s -> 2010.34s]  Nice gag game.
[2010.34s -> 2011.22s]  Now play Deathloop.
[2021.78s -> 2023.14s]  I'm having fun.
[2023.14s -> 2024.02s]  Let me have fun.
[2024.82s -> 2031.26s]  Okay.
[2031.82s -> 2032.78s]  Wait, watch out for the big guy.
[2034.06s -> 2035.18s]  Play House Flipper?
[2035.18s -> 2036.54s]  I don't want to play House Flipper.
[2037.34s -> 2042.74s]  I don't want to drink the same coffee every day.
[2042.74s -> 2043.70s]  I want a different coffee.
[2044.42s -> 2045.79s]  Sometimes you want a hot coffee.
[2045.79s -> 2047.15s]  Sometimes you want a cold coffee.
[2047.15s -> 2049.23s]  Sometimes you fucking get a guaranteed kill.
[2049.23s -> 2050.11s]  Maybe even two of them.
[2055.28s -> 2065.86s]  I mean, it's my favorite character for sure.
[2066.58s -> 2068.51s]  Yeah, more than two to one Katie.
[2068.51s -> 2070.67s]  Yeah, this is my favorite character in the game.
[2071.31s -> 2077.89s]  Yeah, I mean, this is a really good character to be trying to play.
[2078.69s -> 2080.90s]  What does that mean?
[2081.46s -> 2083.14s]  What does that mean?
[2083.86s -> 2085.84s]  What the fuck does that mean?
[2086.48s -> 2093.01s]  Why is every character talking?
[2093.01s -> 2094.45s]  No, I have to turn that off.
[2094.45s -> 2095.57s]  I have like a voice pack on.
[2103.74s -> 2105.18s]  There's a Thanatos execution.
[2106.06s -> 2107.49s]  Is that what that was?
[2111.12s -> 2112.45s]  I don't know.
[2112.45s -> 2113.09s]  I freaked out.
[2113.09s -> 2114.29s]  Thanatos does so much damage.
[2114.29s -> 2116.05s]  I probably could have gotten really embarrassed if I didn't do that.
[2124.37s -> 2124.69s]  Get it.
[2131.26s -> 2132.70s]  Dude, what's going on here?
[2133.18s -> 2134.14s]  We're down a player, right?
[2134.78s -> 2139.28s]  It's a skin.
[2139.28s -> 2139.92s]  Okay, I see.
[2140.56s -> 2144.61s]  All right.
[2144.61s -> 2145.65s]  What are we doing here?
[2145.65s -> 2145.81s]  Run.
[2147.09s -> 2153.66s]  Do you look up builds?
[2154.70s -> 2156.46s]  No, I'm not playing Conquest or anything.
[2156.46s -> 2157.34s]  I'm just playing for fun.
[2158.22s -> 2164.40s]  You play Metroid Dread?
[2166.32s -> 2167.04s]  I don't think so.
[2170.70s -> 2171.42s]  Nice.
[2171.42s -> 2172.14s]  Good job.
[2172.78s -> 2173.50s]  Excellent work.
[2174.38s -> 2176.62s]  Oh, this is how we get it.
[2176.62s -> 2177.42s]  This is how we bring it back.
[2178.38s -> 2179.95s]  Let's bring this shit back right now.
[2180.91s -> 2182.45s]  First game win.
[2182.45s -> 2183.01s]  Come on.
[2183.01s -> 2184.29s]  Even with down a player, we can do it.
[2188.69s -> 2189.73s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[2189.73s -> 2190.13s]  Come on.
[2191.18s -> 2193.02s]  Speaking of killing sprees.
[2193.02s -> 2196.46s]  We've got just like my hopes and dreams.
[2196.46s -> 2196.86s]  They're all.
[2196.86s -> 2198.06s]  I got that kind of money.
[2198.78s -> 2200.86s]  I got it back.
[2201.42s -> 2208.27s]  Let's use the opinion of Sora and Smash corporate.
[2208.27s -> 2212.11s]  Did somebody report that guy from my most loyal worshipers?
[2212.11s -> 2213.07s]  Okay, let's go.
[2213.07s -> 2213.31s]  Wait.
[2226.32s -> 2228.00s]  Oh, you bastard.
[2228.00s -> 2228.96s]  Why did I do that?
[2228.96s -> 2230.16s]  That was so stupid.
[2230.16s -> 2231.36s]  I just got so greedy.
[2231.36s -> 2232.56s]  I was obsessed.
[2232.56s -> 2233.68s]  I was obsessed.
[2233.68s -> 2234.56s]  What was wrong with me?
[2235.52s -> 2239.76s]  Anubis is the easiest at far away range.
[2239.76s -> 2241.12s]  Anubis is so easy to dodge.
[2245.57s -> 2247.73s]  All right, we're going to win.
[2247.73s -> 2249.33s]  We're going to take this back right now.
[2250.21s -> 2258.27s]  Hey, defensive.
[2258.27s -> 2258.75s]  Defense.
[2259.39s -> 2260.18s]  Defense.
[2260.18s -> 2260.82s]  Defense.
[2260.82s -> 2261.54s]  Let them come to us.
[2262.34s -> 2262.99s]  Defense.
[2266.62s -> 2269.10s]  We win four more team fights and nobody dies.
[2269.10s -> 2269.42s]  We win.
[2270.30s -> 2274.99s]  There was a type of guy to put to pee in the sink.
[2275.63s -> 2276.59s]  Only in an emergency.
[2282.74s -> 2283.57s]  Defense.
[2283.57s -> 2284.85s]  Get him away from us.
[2284.85s -> 2285.89s]  One ticker left.
[2285.89s -> 2286.29s]  It's over.
[2293.46s -> 2293.78s]  Sorry.
[2293.78s -> 2294.10s]  I don't care.
[2294.10s -> 2295.06s]  We're guaranteed to lose.
[2295.06s -> 2305.58s]  Who cares?
[2305.58s -> 2309.71s]  All right.
[2309.71s -> 2311.07s]  You don't change topics.
[2311.07s -> 2311.71s]  What was the topic?
[2314.58s -> 2315.14s]  Appealing.
[2315.14s -> 2315.46s]  All right.
[2315.46s -> 2315.70s]  Nice.
[2316.26s -> 2317.06s]  Good job.
[2317.06s -> 2318.24s]  We were down a player.
[2324.37s -> 2325.17s]  Level 14.
[2325.17s -> 2325.81s]  I was like what?
[2326.61s -> 2327.25s]  Oh, shit.
[2327.89s -> 2330.69s]  Okay, let's play again.
[2330.69s -> 2335.25s]  Toxic streamer.
[2335.25s -> 2337.01s]  Wait, I said only in an emergency.
[2337.65s -> 2341.28s]  I don't know.
[2341.28s -> 2342.48s]  I said the first thing that came to my head.
[2344.93s -> 2345.89s]  Are you going to play Diablo 2?
[2345.89s -> 2347.57s]  I'm not going to play Diablo 2 on stream.
[2347.57s -> 2348.53s]  That is a me game.
[2349.47s -> 2350.43s]  Only for me.
[2350.43s -> 2355.36s]  Oh, turn the announcer off.
[2355.36s -> 2355.52s]  Right.
[2355.52s -> 2356.48s]  How do I do that?
[2356.48s -> 2357.98s]  It's in my like loadout, right?
[2360.32s -> 2361.28s]  Profile.
[2361.28s -> 2363.90s]  What is it?
[2363.90s -> 2364.86s]  Is it in the God screen?
[2365.94s -> 2367.30s]  Where is half of this shit?
[2367.30s -> 2372.02s]  Look at all these.
[2372.02s -> 2372.90s]  Oh, my God.
[2372.90s -> 2373.70s]  Jesus Christ.
[2378.24s -> 2379.28s]  Wizard 101.
[2379.84s -> 2384.85s]  No, don't press.
[2384.85s -> 2385.17s]  I press.
[2386.46s -> 2386.70s]  Fuck.
[2386.70s -> 2387.90s]  I was trying to like hide.
[2387.90s -> 2388.14s]  No.
[2388.14s -> 2389.50s]  I did it too late.
[2389.50s -> 2392.29s]  Oh, God damn it.
[2392.29s -> 2397.22s]  I was trying to hide that.
[2397.22s -> 2398.26s]  I'm so stupid.
[2398.26s -> 2399.38s]  How do I turn this guy?
[2399.38s -> 2399.70s]  Loadout.
[2399.70s -> 2400.78s]  There it is.
[2400.78s -> 2401.10s]  Okay.
[2401.10s -> 2401.74s]  Announcer pack.
[2402.38s -> 2402.86s]  Turn it off.
[2404.82s -> 2405.14s]  Okay.
[2405.14s -> 2410.32s]  Got it.
[2410.32s -> 2411.68s]  Toxic waste mask.
[2411.68s -> 2416.59s]  I don't want to do any of this.
[2416.59s -> 2416.91s]  Wait.
[2416.91s -> 2417.39s]  Okay.
[2417.39s -> 2418.35s]  I was trying to hide the game.
[2421.25s -> 2422.45s]  We want Toon Town.
[2422.45s -> 2425.09s]  I can't get Toon Town to run.
[2425.09s -> 2429.46s]  I already streamed Wizard 101.
[2429.46s -> 2430.26s]  What are you talking about?
[2430.26s -> 2439.46s]  I streamed Wizard 101 like three or four years ago.
[2439.46s -> 2439.78s]  Whatever.
[2439.78s -> 2440.82s]  If you're going to stream Snipe Me,
[2440.82s -> 2441.62s]  you're going to stream Snipe Me.
[2441.62s -> 2444.82s]  You have to have like a two MMR to get into these games.
[2444.82s -> 2445.86s]  That was part of the point.
[2457.87s -> 2459.71s]  You have 10k viewers on Smite.
[2459.71s -> 2461.47s]  That's cool.
[2461.47s -> 2462.27s]  Yeah.
[2462.27s -> 2463.23s]  You know, look.
[2463.23s -> 2464.75s]  I'm just hanging out just having fun.
[2464.75s -> 2467.58s]  If you find this stream to be not to your liking,
[2467.58s -> 2470.75s]  then you don't have to stick around.
[2470.75s -> 2472.27s]  But there's a lot of people here.
[2472.27s -> 2472.99s]  What's up?
[2472.99s -> 2474.43s]  We're going to do viewer games later.
[2474.43s -> 2476.61s]  We're going to do some like comedy games.
[2476.61s -> 2477.41s]  I promise.
[2477.41s -> 2478.72s]  All right.
[2478.72s -> 2479.36s]  Who should I play with?
[2479.92s -> 2489.76s]  Well, we got Hunter.
[2490.98s -> 2491.46s]  Brawler.
[2491.46s -> 2492.74s]  So we have Warrior.
[2492.74s -> 2493.41s]  All right.
[2493.41s -> 2494.37s]  We have physical, physical.
[2494.37s -> 2494.69s]  All right.
[2494.69s -> 2496.37s]  I got to be a guardian.
[2496.37s -> 2498.13s]  I can be anything.
[2498.13s -> 2499.65s]  Be anything I want.
[2499.65s -> 2508.22s]  Play somebody on the bottom three.
[2508.22s -> 2509.10s]  Like Cthulhu.
[2509.10s -> 2509.50s]  I don't know.
[2509.50s -> 2510.78s]  I don't know that character's moves.
[2511.34s -> 2513.10s]  All right.
[2513.10s -> 2513.82s]  I got to make a choice.
[2514.46s -> 2515.66s]  We got magic, magic.
[2515.66s -> 2516.46s]  Physical, physical.
[2518.74s -> 2521.65s]  Jormungandr is a tank.
[2521.65s -> 2524.13s]  So maybe I should play Cthulhu.
[2524.21s -> 2529.42s]  I don't know how to play Cthulhu.
[2529.42s -> 2531.26s]  How about Amazenkab?
[2532.88s -> 2534.00s]  Amazenkab.
[2534.00s -> 2535.20s]  I think that's what I'm feeling right now.
[2535.20s -> 2536.00s]  Double Hunter.
[2536.00s -> 2539.87s]  I'm just going to spam Machine Gun.
[2539.87s -> 2547.36s]  That's the one.
[2547.36s -> 2557.39s]  This actually was my favorite character back when I played a lot.
[2557.39s -> 2560.18s]  Literally nobody wanted this.
[2560.18s -> 2562.02s]  Look.
[2562.02s -> 2563.06s]  Do you understand?
[2563.06s -> 2563.38s]  Okay.
[2563.38s -> 2565.47s]  There's 10,000 people here.
[2565.47s -> 2568.90s]  If I asked all 10,000 of you what your favorite ice cream was,
[2568.90s -> 2570.98s]  you're all going to have different favorite ice creams.
[2570.98s -> 2575.84s]  Some of you are going to say chocolate.
[2575.84s -> 2576.56s]  Some of you are going to say vanilla.
[2576.56s -> 2577.44s]  Some of you are going to say strawberries.
[2577.44s -> 2581.04s]  Some of you are going to say like cookies and cream.
[2581.28s -> 2582.32s]  Everybody has things they like.
[2584.21s -> 2588.05s]  It's hard to agree on exactly what game everyone wants to see.
[2589.01s -> 2593.25s]  And then maybe you like all ice creams.
[2593.25s -> 2594.13s]  Maybe you only like a few.
[2594.13s -> 2595.65s]  Maybe you like frozen yogurt.
[2595.65s -> 2597.17s]  Maybe you don't even want ice cream.
[2597.17s -> 2600.30s]  Are you a hard ice cream or a soft ice cream?
[2600.30s -> 2601.26s]  Soft serve.
[2601.26s -> 2603.79s]  A lot of different opinions here.
[2603.79s -> 2608.58s]  That was a very long-winded way to say time that person out for 20 minutes.
[2608.58s -> 2611.55s]  Okay.
[2611.55s -> 2612.27s]  Here we go.
[2612.27s -> 2617.26s]  Now make it two.
[2617.26s -> 2617.82s]  Make it 10.
[2617.82s -> 2618.86s]  Make it 10 seconds.
[2618.86s -> 2619.34s]  Wait.
[2619.34s -> 2620.22s]  I need a relic.
[2620.22s -> 2626.22s]  What the fuck was that?
[2627.58s -> 2629.58s]  Why is a cookie monster in my game?
[2629.58s -> 2630.46s]  What's going on?
[2630.46s -> 2632.10s]  Fuck.
[2632.10s -> 2633.22s]  I need to buy one of these.
[2633.22s -> 2645.66s]  This is cool.
[2647.66s -> 2651.98s]  If you don't know about Amazenkab, he's the god of bees.
[2652.54s -> 2653.34s]  He plays hives.
[2653.34s -> 2657.58s]  They give you attack speed, movement speed, and I believe mana per five.
[2657.58s -> 2661.98s]  He also has a bee swarm, which is his second ability, which swarms.
[2661.98s -> 2666.30s]  He's got sticky honey goo, which is a slow and it's trail.
[2666.30s -> 2668.22s]  And his ultimate is the stinger.
[2668.22s -> 2670.86s]  And if you get it in somebody, you get to pick it up and do it again.
[2674.08s -> 2679.82s]  But the way you should be playing Amazenkab is strictly auto attacks only
[2679.82s -> 2683.02s]  and build a shitload of attack speed.
[2683.74s -> 2693.94s]  Oh, this is it right here.
[2693.94s -> 2694.50s]  Baby, come on.
[2694.50s -> 2694.98s]  This is it.
[2694.98s -> 2695.54s]  This is the one.
[2696.18s -> 2697.31s]  Thank you.
[2697.31s -> 2698.51s]  I'll pick that back up.
[2698.51s -> 2700.91s]  And the cooldown is only 15 seconds rather than 80.
[2701.63s -> 2703.15s]  Did I get that kill?
[2703.15s -> 2704.51s]  Somebody stole it from me, but that's fine.
[2705.47s -> 2708.67s]  I have this opinion if you are.
[2709.55s -> 2710.70s]  I get him.
[2711.58s -> 2713.50s]  If you complain about kill stealing in arena.
[2714.30s -> 2724.13s]  All right.
[2724.13s -> 2724.69s]  Don't be cocky.
[2724.69s -> 2725.25s]  Don't be an idiot.
[2730.43s -> 2731.07s]  Bop.
[2731.07s -> 2733.79s]  Who is the cookie monster?
[2734.43s -> 2738.38s]  This is one of the most boring gods in the game.
[2739.54s -> 2739.86s]  Yes.
[2739.86s -> 2745.06s]  But if you take boring and remove it and put like put white out over it
[2745.06s -> 2748.10s]  and then write effective on it, it's essentially saying the same thing.
[2748.10s -> 2748.42s]  Aren't you?
[2749.06s -> 2754.30s]  Oops, that was the wrong item.
[2754.30s -> 2755.34s]  Oh, that's all right.
[2755.34s -> 2758.62s]  He's very effective.
[2759.63s -> 2760.19s]  Yeah, sure.
[2760.19s -> 2762.27s]  Just going boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2762.27s -> 2762.99s]  That's like boring.
[2762.99s -> 2764.27s]  You don't have to like, you know, there's no jump.
[2764.91s -> 2774.48s]  Did I just hit a fucking minion with that?
[2775.04s -> 2779.60s]  I just hit a fucking minion with my ultimate, of course.
[2782.51s -> 2783.47s]  It's awful.
[2783.47s -> 2784.59s]  Does it go through minions?
[2784.59s -> 2785.07s]  I don't remember.
[2791.90s -> 2792.22s]  Nice.
[2792.86s -> 2795.09s]  Don't get cocky.
[2795.09s -> 2795.33s]  Come on.
[2796.05s -> 2796.53s]  Back it up.
[2797.17s -> 2799.14s]  Let him have fun.
[2799.14s -> 2799.86s]  Oh, thanks, guys.
[2800.58s -> 2805.84s]  Just body blocked.
[2805.84s -> 2806.24s]  I'm sorry.
[2806.88s -> 2816.59s]  Oh, three in a row.
[2816.59s -> 2816.99s]  Let me get it.
[2817.79s -> 2820.35s]  Let him have fun.
[2821.15s -> 2822.51s]  I'm just trying to have fun, right?
[2823.15s -> 2824.75s]  It was no plan with this stream.
[2824.75s -> 2828.59s]  I just it was a joke in pre stream chat like three days ago.
[2829.15s -> 2830.83s]  But now it's not a joke because guess what?
[2831.63s -> 2833.20s]  I hate when people do that.
[2833.92s -> 2835.74s]  Now it's not.
[2835.74s -> 2836.06s]  You know what?
[2836.06s -> 2836.46s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2836.46s -> 2836.78s]  You know what?
[2836.78s -> 2839.81s]  It's not a joke because I'm having a good time.
[2840.45s -> 2846.62s]  If the god is alerted to bees, do they take more damage?
[2847.34s -> 2847.74s]  No, it's not.
[2847.74s -> 2848.94s]  This game is not fucking realistic.
[2848.94s -> 2849.34s]  It sucks.
[2850.88s -> 2852.80s]  All I ask for is a little bit of realism.
[2852.80s -> 2856.32s]  Like actual like bullet damage and like cut damage and stuff.
[2856.32s -> 2860.10s]  And actual like body damage to the cars and stuff like that.
[2860.90s -> 2869.26s]  That's not bad.
[2869.26s -> 2869.66s]  All right.
[2869.66s -> 2869.98s]  Yeah.
[2869.98s -> 2870.54s]  Put him right.
[2870.54s -> 2871.34s]  Put him in the tower.
[2871.34s -> 2871.50s]  Good.
[2875.47s -> 2876.59s]  What are they doing over here?
[2877.23s -> 2882.94s]  Why are you doing all this, man?
[2885.95s -> 2887.04s]  Fuck.
[2887.04s -> 2898.70s]  Don't let her kill me.
[2899.66s -> 2904.94s]  That's not based of you.
[2905.58s -> 2909.34s]  Worst stream of 2020.
[2909.34s -> 2911.58s]  That is a game.
[2911.58s -> 2911.90s]  All right.
[2913.10s -> 2914.46s]  A gaming stream.
[2914.46s -> 2915.50s]  A gaming stream.
[2915.50s -> 2917.89s]  I'm just playing a game.
[2917.89s -> 2921.41s]  Well, I can't play a game on stream.
[2921.41s -> 2923.09s]  And I've been playing a game poorly.
[2923.09s -> 2924.37s]  I'm 4 and 0.
[2924.37s -> 2925.65s]  Excuse me.
[2925.65s -> 2933.58s]  Are we going to calculate stream poor like levels of poor quality based on video game playing?
[2953.47s -> 2954.43s]  Keep it up.
[2954.43s -> 2956.80s]  Yeah, I actually really like that character.
[2960.59s -> 2963.70s]  Um, wow.
[2964.26s -> 2969.76s]  This gives me nostalgia to the old smite videos.
[2970.66s -> 2972.42s]  I actually really enjoyed this game a lot.
[2978.11s -> 2979.31s]  Used to play this game.
[2979.31s -> 2979.95s]  Oh, yeah.
[2979.95s -> 2981.95s]  Back in the like technical alpha.
[2981.95s -> 2982.59s]  Whatever it was.
[2982.59s -> 2983.63s]  I played this game all the time.
[2988.11s -> 2989.79s]  Uh, I don't you know, it's funny.
[2989.79s -> 2991.15s]  I only pick these three.
[2991.15s -> 2993.39s]  I don't even know what the other items even do.
[2994.75s -> 2997.07s]  In the years that I've played this game, I've never scrolled over them.
[3000.18s -> 3002.10s]  Back in the MLC stealth days.
[3002.10s -> 3003.22s]  Yeah, you wanted something crazy.
[3003.94s -> 3007.38s]  I mean, maybe some of the newer um, newer viewers might not know this.
[3008.10s -> 3008.98s]  Uh, so I had a friend.
[3009.62s -> 3011.06s]  We used to make videos and shit all the time.
[3011.86s -> 3012.66s]  MLC stealth.
[3013.46s -> 3015.70s]  The guy and his team.
[3016.26s -> 3017.46s]  They were all really good at the game.
[3018.34s -> 3021.62s]  They won two and a half million fucking dollars playing this game.
[3022.74s -> 3025.78s]  During like the first smite world championship.
[3026.42s -> 3027.38s]  I remember watching it.
[3027.38s -> 3035.52s]  It was insane.
[3035.52s -> 3038.88s]  That's the only time that I really ever cared about esports stuff.
[3038.88s -> 3040.08s]  Really, to be honest.
[3040.08s -> 3041.44s]  It was just like, oh my god.
[3041.44s -> 3044.96s]  This guy's gonna, this team is gonna win fucking millions.
[3054.62s -> 3055.42s]  Got him.
[3055.42s -> 3064.58s]  That's pocket change.
[3065.14s -> 3067.09s]  What planet are you from?
[3067.09s -> 3067.59s]  What?
[3071.50s -> 3073.50s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[3074.30s -> 3077.28s]  All right.
[3077.58s -> 3078.08s]  Group up.
[3078.70s -> 3083.73s]  See those auto attacks?
[3083.73s -> 3084.69s]  They're so deadly.
[3084.69s -> 3084.93s]  All right.
[3084.93s -> 3088.37s]  I just don't, at some point when you play moves and cop, you know, you don't even do moves anymore.
[3088.37s -> 3089.09s]  Why, what am I doing?
[3089.65s -> 3094.88s]  You just have to be good at landing shots.
[3094.88s -> 3097.04s]  Which I'm obviously not very good at right now.
[3097.92s -> 3102.93s]  Don't silence me.
[3103.89s -> 3104.45s]  Okay.
[3104.53s -> 3113.10s]  Is that mostly still the pro esports man now?
[3113.10s -> 3113.60s]  No.
[3114.48s -> 3117.20s]  I'm fairly certain that they won that tournament.
[3118.93s -> 3120.45s]  And then I think he started working for high res.
[3120.45s -> 3121.73s]  He works for, he's working for high res.
[3122.29s -> 3125.42s]  It's a very interesting story.
[3125.42s -> 3134.06s]  How do you set a stream to times two speed?
[3135.97s -> 3138.77s]  You wait until about six to seven hours from now.
[3139.57s -> 3141.81s]  There'll be a clickable video that you can click on.
[3142.69s -> 3144.70s]  Oh, you know, you can't even do that on a VOD, can you?
[3145.34s -> 3153.30s]  Oh, that hurts.
[3154.18s -> 3155.14s]  Oh, that hurts too.
[3155.94s -> 3163.25s]  You're gonna play for seven hours?
[3163.25s -> 3163.73s]  I don't know.
[3163.73s -> 3164.37s]  I don't have a plan.
[3173.87s -> 3175.58s]  Ah, no.
[3181.65s -> 3183.65s]  Losing subscribers, losing subscribers.
[3183.65s -> 3184.77s]  No, don't, don't do that.
[3189.76s -> 3190.48s]  Definitely want this.
[3190.48s -> 3191.60s]  I want to just be a machine gun.
[3191.60s -> 3192.40s]  Then I got to get the crits.
[3203.31s -> 3204.43s]  Tack speed baloney?
[3204.43s -> 3206.03s]  What's the tack speed baloney?
[3206.03s -> 3212.83s]  We put you in the top 100 list and we can take you out of it.
[3214.85s -> 3215.49s]  Yeah.
[3215.49s -> 3219.25s]  Yeah, no, I, whatever.
[3233.86s -> 3234.74s]  Tack speed Andy.
[3235.38s -> 3238.80s]  Oh, this person's not happy with me.
[3239.60s -> 3240.96s]  Oh my God.
[3240.96s -> 3242.24s]  This person just dove to kill me.
[3242.96s -> 3243.60s]  Holy shit.
[3243.60s -> 3244.16s]  All of them dove.
[3244.16s -> 3244.96s]  The whole team dove.
[3262.19s -> 3263.15s]  Stream sniped.
[3263.15s -> 3265.71s]  No, I, I highly doubt anybody's stream sniping.
[3265.71s -> 3267.15s]  I really don't think so.
[3267.15s -> 3267.95s]  I'd be shocked.
[3268.59s -> 3279.28s]  I missed every fucking single shot.
[3279.28s -> 3279.84s]  Come on, dude.
[3280.80s -> 3281.87s]  What was that?
[3282.43s -> 3283.31s]  That was weird lag.
[3284.03s -> 3287.84s]  Once you start firing so fast,
[3287.84s -> 3290.00s]  it's so easy just to like just miss everything.
[3290.72s -> 3302.48s]  Wait, silence even works for auto attacks?
[3303.12s -> 3310.50s]  Watch out.
[3318.72s -> 3319.44s]  Come on, hit him.
[3326.77s -> 3328.21s]  I had to dive and kill that guy.
[3328.21s -> 3329.41s]  That was embarrassing if I didn't.
[3330.05s -> 3334.32s]  Press VVX.
[3334.96s -> 3348.59s]  I don't understand what's going on in this game.
[3348.59s -> 3349.15s]  I'll tell you.
[3352.35s -> 3353.71s]  5v5 in an arena.
[3354.27s -> 3355.87s]  This is not the regular game mode.
[3355.87s -> 3361.41s]  The regular game mode is more akin to something like League or Dota
[3361.41s -> 3362.77s]  that you've probably seen a million times.
[3367.68s -> 3369.28s]  This is just a for fun mode.
[3369.28s -> 3370.32s]  It's a warm up mode.
[3372.61s -> 3374.21s]  And I promise I will jungle.
[3377.97s -> 3381.97s]  I will jungle in a conquest game if we do some viewer games, which we will.
[3385.15s -> 3385.95s]  It's going to be embarrassing.
[3385.95s -> 3387.39s]  I'm going to get probably really pissed off.
[3387.95s -> 3389.47s]  It will play assault too.
[3389.47s -> 3390.99s]  Don't worry if anyone wants to look.
[3390.99s -> 3393.15s]  I know that if I open up to viewer games,
[3393.15s -> 3396.43s]  I'm going to get absolutely stomped.
[3396.43s -> 3396.99s]  That's fine.
[3397.71s -> 3398.11s]  It's all right.
[3398.11s -> 3398.75s]  We're just having fun.
[3399.55s -> 3415.10s]  Now I'm just going to watch Omega Low.
[3424.62s -> 3425.58s]  Ooh, that stings.
[3425.58s -> 3426.14s]  So does that.
[3426.94s -> 3431.57s]  All right, I got to go back.
[3431.57s -> 3436.14s]  Sorry, my ego can get shattered.
[3438.38s -> 3439.98s]  No, it doesn't.
[3439.98s -> 3440.86s]  I don't care.
[3440.86s -> 3441.82s]  I'm just fucking around.
[3444.93s -> 3446.21s]  I'm just going to get every bow.
[3446.93s -> 3447.73s]  No, what am I doing?
[3447.73s -> 3448.77s]  Can I refund?
[3450.19s -> 3450.91s]  I want to refund.
[3450.91s -> 3452.03s]  All right, here we go.
[3452.03s -> 3455.82s]  I want crit.
[3455.82s -> 3462.02s]  Are you going to play DOS games in the future?
[3462.02s -> 3462.50s]  Probably.
[3463.14s -> 3464.40s]  I'm open to anything, man.
[3464.88s -> 3470.18s]  Oh, fuck, that hurts.
[3470.82s -> 3477.63s]  Oh, my God, get her off me.
[3480.08s -> 3482.64s]  I think I'm all seven of that Belonis kills.
[3482.64s -> 3487.95s]  Well, five.
[3487.95s -> 3495.33s]  Mr. Jeremy, we politely ask for Germacraft
[3495.33s -> 3496.61s]  to be played on this broadcast.
[3500.85s -> 3501.97s]  We politely ask.
[3502.61s -> 3507.71s]  Just we're going to win.
[3507.71s -> 3508.59s]  We're good.
[3508.59s -> 3515.90s]  10 years later, Belonis still OP.
[3515.90s -> 3517.74s]  What even is the tier list look like nowadays?
[3518.38s -> 3519.46s]  I have no idea.
[3524.42s -> 3525.86s]  We could really easily fuck this up
[3525.86s -> 3526.58s]  if we're not careful.
[3527.38s -> 3530.24s]  All right, good.
[3530.24s -> 3531.94s]  Yeah, Amuza Cup is weird
[3531.94s -> 3532.90s]  because when you auto attack,
[3532.90s -> 3534.74s]  it almost feels like it comes from the right shoulder,
[3534.74s -> 3535.62s]  not right in front of you.
[3537.14s -> 3540.78s]  Should I unironically get into this game?
[3540.78s -> 3542.54s]  That depends.
[3542.54s -> 3545.90s]  Do you like a MOBA that is a third person perspective?
[3546.54s -> 3548.67s]  That's not click to move.
[3548.67s -> 3549.63s]  It's WASD.
[3550.43s -> 3552.42s]  I mean, that's up to you.
[3554.37s -> 3555.81s]  Bull is the best hunter.
[3555.81s -> 3561.06s]  Well, yeah, you have to stop at that first sentence.
[3561.06s -> 3562.58s]  Do you want a MOBA?
[3563.22s -> 3564.50s]  Don't say anything else.
[3564.50s -> 3572.59s]  All right, we'll do one more of these
[3572.59s -> 3573.47s]  and then I'm going to do,
[3573.47s -> 3574.59s]  we'll do some assault viewer games
[3575.15s -> 3579.04s]  so I can warm up.
[3581.55s -> 3583.15s]  You still get the TMNT skins.
[3583.15s -> 3583.95s]  I think you can.
[3583.95s -> 3592.06s]  I'm pretty sure you need to be level 15 for assault.
[3592.06s -> 3593.58s]  Not if you do a custom game.
[3594.14s -> 3601.60s]  I can just create a custom game.
[3601.60s -> 3603.68s]  That means it's just people in this chat.
[3603.68s -> 3609.33s]  Weren't there avatar skins?
[3609.33s -> 3612.37s]  Yeah, they added so many skins to this game.
[3612.37s -> 3613.73s]  It's hard to even keep track.
[3613.73s -> 3615.81s]  I see screenshots of skins
[3615.81s -> 3619.39s]  and think they are other characters.
[3619.39s -> 3622.02s]  It's not just skins anymore.
[3622.02s -> 3623.38s]  It's like, I don't even know.
[3623.38s -> 3624.90s]  Okay, I know Aang is in the game,
[3624.90s -> 3627.46s]  but I have no fucking idea what character he is.
[3627.46s -> 3628.42s]  I have no idea.
[3628.42s -> 3636.08s]  All right, what am I going to play?
[3636.08s -> 3637.20s]  Merlin, okay.
[3637.20s -> 3645.36s]  All right, we got tank, image, mage.
[3645.36s -> 3646.88s]  Oh, no, I have to play the tank.
[3646.88s -> 3647.52s]  All right.
[3647.52s -> 3648.32s]  Oh, no.
[3648.32s -> 3651.47s]  Should I?
[3651.47s -> 3653.63s]  All right, he's flipping back and forth
[3653.63s -> 3656.35s]  showing that he's willing to play tank or damage.
[3656.35s -> 3657.84s]  What should I do?
[3657.84s -> 3661.71s]  Play Ymir?
[3661.71s -> 3664.29s]  No, Anubis?
[3664.29s -> 3667.41s]  All right, I'm going to play Bacchus?
[3669.06s -> 3671.92s]  Bracken?
[3671.92s -> 3673.76s]  Shit, I hate being the last person to pick.
[3673.76s -> 3676.74s]  Everyone just sitting there tapping their foot for me.
[3676.74s -> 3680.34s]  All right, I'm going to play as Cthulhu.
[3680.34s -> 3680.98s]  All right.
[3686.80s -> 3693.71s]  I don't know how to play Cthulhu.
[3693.71s -> 3694.99s]  You're going to play Darkest Dungeon 2?
[3694.99s -> 3695.47s]  Absolutely.
[3701.01s -> 3703.97s]  Is Cthulhu a tank, a guardian, or is he a war?
[3703.97s -> 3704.61s]  What is he?
[3704.61s -> 3711.33s]  I think he's a guardian, right?
[3711.33s -> 3720.75s]  This is epic.
[3721.31s -> 3727.73s]  You're going to play a game, Zooted, on stream?
[3729.36s -> 3730.80s]  I stopped doing that when I couldn't read
[3730.80s -> 3732.24s]  an analog clock on camera.
[3733.14s -> 3735.62s]  That was the last time I believe I did that.
[3736.18s -> 3739.12s]  All right, what do they got?
[3740.78s -> 3745.63s]  Physical, magical, physical, magical.
[3746.27s -> 3747.23s]  All right, we need magic.
[3747.23s -> 3748.35s]  We need magic protection.
[3750.74s -> 3751.06s]  Go.
[3752.06s -> 3752.38s]  Good.
[3755.44s -> 3758.96s]  Now let's play a game called, how do you play Cthulhu?
[3759.52s -> 3762.42s]  All right, this is too much reading.
[3762.42s -> 3763.38s]  It's too much.
[3763.38s -> 3766.26s]  Damage sends out a terrifying blast of energy.
[3766.26s -> 3768.26s]  It does damage and reduces stuff.
[3768.98s -> 3769.62s]  Ground target.
[3769.62s -> 3771.70s]  Cthulhu summons a portal, creating a slowing field
[3771.70s -> 3773.78s]  of Eldritch Mire at the target location.
[3774.83s -> 3776.99s]  While Cthulhu channels, the Mire continues to grow as a portal.
[3776.99s -> 3779.23s]  Fires out two massive eruptions, but it does damage.
[3779.23s -> 3779.73s]  Okay.
[3780.78s -> 3781.90s]  It's a dash.
[3781.90s -> 3784.22s]  Cthulhu creates two twisting projectiles at his side.
[3785.18s -> 3786.78s]  Is there a button I can press where it just tells me
[3786.78s -> 3788.06s]  what the move does?
[3788.06s -> 3791.50s]  I don't like when the lore is inside of the explanation
[3791.50s -> 3792.72s]  of the move.
[3792.72s -> 3794.96s]  I know I get it, but I want a distinct,
[3794.96s -> 3800.11s]  just press a button and tell me what it does.
[3800.11s -> 3803.87s]  Dash, and this is a stim.
[3803.87s -> 3804.43s]  True form.
[3804.43s -> 3805.23s]  All right, let's go.
[3805.23s -> 3821.44s]  He's so slow.
[3821.44s -> 3822.64s]  I don't know, I'm just going in.
[3822.64s -> 3823.20s]  I'm just diving.
[3824.56s -> 3827.25s]  I don't know what any of those moves did,
[3827.25s -> 3831.28s]  but I think I heard somebody.
[3831.28s -> 3832.24s]  Just press buttons.
[3832.24s -> 3834.64s]  You can't street fighter.
[3835.20s -> 3836.00s]  What am I doing?
[3836.88s -> 3839.65s]  Oh my God, it worked.
[3840.21s -> 3841.46s]  I'm dead.
[3842.70s -> 3845.18s]  You can't play a MOBA and use the street fighter
[3845.18s -> 3846.62s]  button mash concept.
[3846.62s -> 3848.38s]  It doesn't work like that.
[3848.38s -> 3857.90s]  With Cthulhu, you literally mash buttons.
[3865.10s -> 3866.14s]  All right, should I just alt in?
[3869.20s -> 3870.00s]  Holy shit.
[3870.94s -> 3872.06s]  So that's what this thing is.
[3872.86s -> 3876.22s]  Does he have moves?
[3876.86s -> 3879.18s]  This feels unfair.
[3880.80s -> 3882.48s]  Holy shit, that's insane.
[3882.48s -> 3888.42s]  What am I doing?
[3894.35s -> 3895.15s]  Oh no.
[3895.15s -> 3896.35s]  Oh no, I'm going to be feeding.
[3896.35s -> 3897.23s]  This is bad.
[3897.23s -> 3898.03s]  Oh, this is not good.
[3905.95s -> 3907.47s]  If there's a time where you can feed
[3907.47s -> 3908.59s]  and not be feel bad about it,
[3908.59s -> 3918.24s]  it's probably arena.
[3918.24s -> 3919.36s]  Just blame your team.
[3920.00s -> 3922.29s]  You want me to dive the tower and then say,
[3923.74s -> 3925.42s]  you rock, you rock, you rock.
[3926.54s -> 3927.58s]  You rock, you rock.
[3927.58s -> 3928.78s]  I don't do that shit.
[3929.42s -> 3930.14s]  Don't be annoying.
[3934.11s -> 3936.06s]  Oh, somebody's doing it.
[3936.06s -> 3936.78s]  Wait, they're doing it.
[3936.78s -> 3938.62s]  Oh, wait, this person was doing it?
[3938.62s -> 3939.58s]  No, they weren't.
[3939.58s -> 3943.41s]  Oh, they're watching the stream.
[3944.61s -> 3953.26s]  So what does the best?
[3953.26s -> 3954.14s]  Okay, that's pretty good.
[3964.16s -> 3965.04s]  I got to get up in there.
[3966.00s -> 3966.96s]  Oh, they killed that guy.
[3966.96s -> 3977.41s]  That was all right.
[3977.41s -> 3978.13s]  V-E-R.
[3978.77s -> 3980.75s]  Oh no, I didn't want to do that.
[3987.15s -> 3987.55s]  Stay in.
[3987.55s -> 3988.03s]  Let's stay in.
[3988.59s -> 3992.00s]  Oh, get out.
[3992.00s -> 3992.48s]  Everybody out.
[3993.04s -> 3994.32s]  Everybody get out.
[3995.73s -> 3996.77s]  Everybody get out.
[3999.22s -> 3999.46s]  Shit.
[4000.10s -> 4009.22s]  They were V-R-R.
[4009.22s -> 4012.80s]  Now that's a little late.
[4012.80s -> 4024.64s]  I can see why people think he's fun.
[4024.64s -> 4028.29s]  He's just like a huge slug guy
[4028.29s -> 4029.81s]  that can grow 50 feet tall.
[4030.69s -> 4033.18s]  So this is arena.
[4033.18s -> 4035.34s]  I wonder how awful it is to play with
[4035.34s -> 4038.06s]  against a Cthulhu in the regular game mode.
[4038.06s -> 4039.02s]  He takes up the whole screen.
[4039.66s -> 4041.73s]  Wouldn't that be awful in a team fight?
[4042.45s -> 4046.43s]  Oh, fuck it.
[4046.43s -> 4046.83s]  Let's go.
[4047.47s -> 4056.14s]  You still in?
[4056.86s -> 4060.58s]  All right.
[4060.58s -> 4061.14s]  Nice.
[4061.14s -> 4061.54s]  Good job.
[4062.26s -> 4070.38s]  You're big.
[4070.38s -> 4071.26s]  You don't have to do shit.
[4071.82s -> 4074.00s]  Oh, I have to go back.
[4074.64s -> 4078.74s]  Cthulhu is not actually that amazing.
[4078.74s -> 4082.61s]  Please pick a different character
[4082.61s -> 4083.89s]  that's not so scary.
[4088.78s -> 4089.66s]  Probably cooldown, right?
[4090.94s -> 4091.82s]  Who's doing all the damage?
[4093.78s -> 4094.50s]  There's only like two people
[4094.50s -> 4095.38s]  that are physical on the whole team.
[4095.38s -> 4095.70s]  Whatever.
[4096.26s -> 4100.83s]  If you build him correctly,
[4100.83s -> 4101.63s]  he hits really hard.
[4102.27s -> 4109.76s]  Get over here.
[4111.42s -> 4111.90s]  Yeah.
[4112.78s -> 4118.80s]  Oh, shit.
[4118.80s -> 4119.52s]  This guy's pretty low.
[4120.24s -> 4125.86s]  You just fucked over the Ra?
[4126.58s -> 4131.97s]  Where'd he go?
[4131.97s -> 4132.54s]  Is he dead?
[4133.10s -> 4135.89s]  Ra, you got to get out of here.
[4135.89s -> 4136.29s]  Run away.
[4136.93s -> 4138.34s]  Ra, you got to get out of here.
[4138.34s -> 4138.66s]  Get out of here.
[4138.66s -> 4139.22s]  You got to get out of here.
[4139.22s -> 4139.86s]  Get out of here.
[4139.86s -> 4140.42s]  Get out of here.
[4140.42s -> 4142.34s]  Ra, you got to get out of here.
[4142.34s -> 4148.70s]  No, I shouldn't.
[4148.70s -> 4149.42s]  I don't want to stand in that.
[4149.42s -> 4149.90s]  It's not mine.
[4150.46s -> 4153.87s]  Sorry.
[4153.87s -> 4154.35s]  I'm the tank.
[4154.35s -> 4154.91s]  I'm supposed to die.
[4169.60s -> 4171.04s]  That hurt my ears.
[4171.04s -> 4171.76s]  Sorry.
[4171.76s -> 4174.67s]  I was doing the walrus.
[4174.67s -> 4183.07s]  Does he have a...
[4183.07s -> 4183.47s]  He does.
[4183.47s -> 4183.71s]  Okay.
[4183.71s -> 4184.75s]  It's a three-hit combo.
[4184.75s -> 4186.67s]  It's one, two, three, and a cone.
[4187.23s -> 4187.95s]  Damn, that's good.
[4197.07s -> 4198.11s]  We need everybody here.
[4198.11s -> 4198.99s]  There's only three of us here.
[4199.63s -> 4201.07s]  I need another coffee, man.
[4201.07s -> 4202.51s]  I need another coffee, man.
[4212.59s -> 4213.71s]  I'm going in once we get here.
[4215.04s -> 4216.16s]  When the Ares pulls everybody,
[4216.16s -> 4222.72s]  that's when I'm going to go in.
[4222.72s -> 4223.20s]  Oh, shit.
[4223.20s -> 4223.68s]  They're going in.
[4224.16s -> 4224.56s]  Oh, shit.
[4224.56s -> 4225.04s]  He's going in.
[4226.14s -> 4227.74s]  Oh, okay.
[4227.74s -> 4228.70s]  All right.
[4229.34s -> 4242.11s]  All right.
[4242.11s -> 4242.43s]  We did it.
[4242.99s -> 4243.47s]  Nice work.
[4247.87s -> 4248.67s]  Oh, shit.
[4249.23s -> 4250.19s]  No, back up, back up, back up.
[4250.19s -> 4250.59s]  Run away.
[4254.85s -> 4255.89s]  You can tell he's stoned.
[4255.89s -> 4256.29s]  I'm not...
[4256.29s -> 4257.49s]  Why would I do that and play Smite?
[4257.49s -> 4258.13s]  Are you kidding me?
[4258.69s -> 4260.80s]  I'd get stuck in the menu.
[4265.36s -> 4265.76s]  People are like,
[4265.76s -> 4266.08s]  what do you mean?
[4266.08s -> 4267.04s]  Like, question mark, question mark.
[4267.04s -> 4268.16s]  Let me ask you something.
[4269.28s -> 4270.64s]  I don't know why this is a trend
[4270.64s -> 4272.00s]  in current video games,
[4272.00s -> 4273.44s]  especially in mobile games.
[4273.44s -> 4274.96s]  I'm not calling Smite a mobile game,
[4274.96s -> 4276.32s]  but holy shit.
[4278.37s -> 4279.41s]  Do we need to have
[4280.21s -> 4281.97s]  like 30 sub menus
[4281.97s -> 4283.25s]  throughout the course of the game's menu?
[4284.72s -> 4286.96s]  There's like 15 different like things
[4286.96s -> 4288.40s]  to purchase and bundles,
[4288.40s -> 4291.60s]  and you get like a bunch of ads
[4291.60s -> 4293.12s]  pop up of different chests
[4293.12s -> 4294.56s]  and bundles and packs,
[4294.56s -> 4297.25s]  and I don't even know where to start.
[4304.02s -> 4305.54s]  I remember I played a mobile game one time
[4306.26s -> 4307.38s]  and I'm not kidding.
[4308.02s -> 4309.94s]  When I got to the game's main screen,
[4309.94s -> 4311.30s]  where it's like, okay, time to play.
[4312.26s -> 4315.14s]  I think like eight different pop ups
[4315.14s -> 4316.42s]  happened before I was actually able
[4316.42s -> 4317.22s]  to even see the menu,
[4317.22s -> 4319.06s]  and the menu is a fucking mess.
[4320.56s -> 4324.08s]  Just like 12 red exclamation marks
[4324.08s -> 4325.92s]  across eight different,
[4325.92s -> 4327.20s]  five different menus,
[4327.20s -> 4328.48s]  12 different menus.
[4328.48s -> 4330.56s]  It's like, I don't want this on my screen,
[4331.62s -> 4333.38s]  and you have to click the fucking thing
[4333.38s -> 4335.86s]  to get the red exclamation mark to go away.
[4336.74s -> 4339.14s]  It's like, I don't want any red exclamation,
[4339.14s -> 4340.10s]  make them all go away.
[4340.74s -> 4344.32s]  And then sometimes you have to find
[4344.32s -> 4346.80s]  where the red exclamation mark even is.
[4346.80s -> 4349.97s]  It's like, oh, I have a red exclamation
[4349.97s -> 4350.77s]  in achievements.
[4351.57s -> 4353.33s]  Okay, I clicked achievements.
[4354.27s -> 4355.23s]  Okay, now you have to scroll
[4355.23s -> 4357.47s]  and find the fucking achievement it is
[4357.47s -> 4358.91s]  and click it and look at it
[4358.91s -> 4359.63s]  before it goes away.
[4360.19s -> 4364.10s]  What is going on here?
[4372.54s -> 4373.74s]  Holy shit, that was a good snipe.
[4373.74s -> 4374.22s]  Nice job.
[4374.78s -> 4380.83s]  We got this big guy.
[4381.47s -> 4385.33s]  Get some damage.
[4385.33s -> 4386.77s]  I have no idea how to play this character.
[4386.77s -> 4387.33s]  I'm terrified.
[4388.05s -> 4389.01s]  I'm just going to play only
[4389.01s -> 4390.37s]  to just straight up damage sync.
[4391.01s -> 4394.18s]  I'm just taking damage for no reason.
[4394.18s -> 4399.79s]  Can you play League of Legends?
[4399.79s -> 4401.15s]  No, that's different.
[4404.53s -> 4406.37s]  It was one game that I considered playing
[4406.93s -> 4407.57s]  back in the day.
[4408.53s -> 4410.69s]  It was Han, Heroes of North.
[4410.69s -> 4412.32s]  Why is that, you ask?
[4412.32s -> 4415.49s]  I cannot stand, cannot stand it
[4416.30s -> 4418.14s]  when a game has click delay to move.
[4419.92s -> 4422.00s]  Han did not have click delay.
[4422.64s -> 4424.08s]  When you clicked, you moved instantly.
[4424.08s -> 4425.12s]  Your character turned.
[4425.12s -> 4427.92s]  I don't like the like one half second,
[4427.92s -> 4429.20s]  a full second delay
[4429.20s -> 4430.32s]  when you click to go somewhere.
[4430.32s -> 4431.20s]  I hate it.
[4431.92s -> 4434.99s]  That's why I play this.
[4434.99s -> 4438.56s]  All right, I think we're going to go
[4438.56s -> 4439.12s]  in a second here.
[4446.02s -> 4446.98s]  League doesn't have that.
[4446.98s -> 4449.14s]  League has, I think, the biggest click delay
[4449.14s -> 4450.58s]  out of all the games.
[4451.22s -> 4451.92s]  Let's go.
[4452.48s -> 4459.60s]  I don't even know what these moves do,
[4459.60s -> 4473.30s]  but I'm doing them.
[4473.30s -> 4474.18s]  Oh, shit.
[4474.18s -> 4474.74s]  All right, let's go.
[4474.74s -> 4475.22s]  Everyone leave.
[4481.86s -> 4482.74s]  League is instant?
[4482.74s -> 4485.92s]  League is not instant.
[4485.92s -> 4492.37s]  Run away.
[4492.37s -> 4493.41s]  Oh, that might kill him.
[4496.19s -> 4497.23s]  You didn't do any damage.
[4497.23s -> 4498.11s]  You overextended.
[4502.50s -> 4503.54s]  League is instant.
[4505.42s -> 4506.22s]  That has to be new.
[4517.82s -> 4518.78s]  What's the click delay in League?
[4519.42s -> 4520.46s]  You had bad internet.
[4521.02s -> 4521.58s]  No, I didn't.
[4521.58s -> 4522.46s]  My internet was fine.
[4523.26s -> 4527.18s]  All right, fuck it.
[4527.18s -> 4534.78s]  Let's go in.
[4534.78s -> 4536.06s]  Not too far in.
[4536.06s -> 4540.24s]  All right, everyone back out.
[4541.10s -> 4541.60s]  Whoa.
[4546.06s -> 4546.70s]  It's instant.
[4546.70s -> 4547.82s]  Always has been.
[4547.82s -> 4551.55s]  You're thinking of Dota.
[4551.55s -> 4554.42s]  It's not delay.
[4554.42s -> 4555.30s]  It's turn speed.
[4555.30s -> 4556.34s]  Well, whatever the hell it is.
[4557.31s -> 4560.11s]  When I right, when I click to move in those games,
[4560.11s -> 4561.71s]  they don't move there immediately.
[4561.71s -> 4563.07s]  They like have to take a second
[4563.07s -> 4566.64s]  and then they move on was not like that.
[4567.28s -> 4574.96s]  And I'm talking like I was some big player
[4574.96s -> 4575.76s]  of Heroes of New Earth.
[4575.76s -> 4578.77s]  I played it maybe for 15 minutes and said,
[4578.77s -> 4579.73s]  no, I don't want to do this.
[4580.53s -> 4591.78s]  Ooh, they.
[4593.60s -> 4594.48s]  All right, all right, all right.
[4594.48s -> 4595.12s]  I'm in a minute.
[4595.12s -> 4595.44s]  I'm in.
[4595.44s -> 4596.00s]  Let's go, let's go.
[4599.33s -> 4600.13s]  Just break it all up.
[4600.13s -> 4601.17s]  Just be a fucking nuisance.
[4601.17s -> 4601.89s]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[4601.89s -> 4602.45s]  All right, retreat.
[4602.45s -> 4602.85s]  You got it.
[4603.49s -> 4609.68s]  He's really cool.
[4610.40s -> 4612.16s]  This is definitely a little brother character, by the way.
[4613.76s -> 4614.72s]  Absolutely.
[4614.72s -> 4616.08s]  You want to play spite with your little brother,
[4616.80s -> 4619.76s]  have them pick Cthulhu and build only tank items.
[4620.32s -> 4621.92s]  And they're not doing anything.
[4621.92s -> 4623.52s]  They're just kind of a nuisance in the way,
[4623.52s -> 4624.88s]  but like they're going to be alive.
[4624.88s -> 4625.44s]  They'll be okay.
[4626.40s -> 4635.12s]  And they get to get huge.
[4635.12s -> 4636.56s]  Like, oh, I'm huge.
[4637.36s -> 4639.06s]  You could be like, oh, there you go.
[4640.37s -> 4641.41s]  Mike, there you go, Michael.
[4644.35s -> 4645.47s]  Oh, you got that guy.
[4645.47s -> 4646.27s]  You got that guy.
[4646.27s -> 4648.51s]  And you do player damage and he did one damage.
[4649.31s -> 4656.88s]  Oh, shit.
[4656.88s -> 4658.16s]  We're really kind of tearing it up here.
[4658.88s -> 4667.68s]  BM, BM, BM, BM, BM, BM, fucking BM.
[4668.40s -> 4673.10s]  That's so stupid.
[4673.90s -> 4678.58s]  Imagine hearing that over voice chat.
[4678.58s -> 4680.10s]  I turn on voice chat.
[4680.10s -> 4681.54s]  BM, BM, dude, get the fuck in there.
[4681.54s -> 4682.10s]  BM.
[4682.10s -> 4684.72s]  It's like, relax, man.
[4685.28s -> 4689.39s]  I need physical.
[4696.08s -> 4697.68s]  Actually, really shouldn't have done that.
[4697.68s -> 4699.60s]  Because this is a pretty close game.
[4699.60s -> 4701.68s]  Why do I think we were really running away with it there?
[4701.68s -> 4702.08s]  We weren't.
[4703.04s -> 4708.64s]  What the hell are these stupid rings?
[4709.60s -> 4711.36s]  These fucking Sonic the Hedgehog rings.
[4711.36s -> 4712.96s]  I've stopped so I'm not going to swear anymore.
[4713.97s -> 4715.33s]  What the fuck is going on?
[4715.33s -> 4715.65s]  All right.
[4715.65s -> 4716.61s]  What is happening?
[4716.61s -> 4717.11s]  Why?
[4726.22s -> 4726.72s]  No.
[4727.34s -> 4734.93s]  All right.
[4734.93s -> 4738.02s]  I got to let it be known that me and that rod just saved the day.
[4746.64s -> 4747.92s]  Is Sonic and Smite?
[4747.92s -> 4748.32s]  I don't know.
[4748.96s -> 4752.51s]  No, Sonic is not Nickelodeon.
[4753.31s -> 4757.12s]  There it is.
[4758.37s -> 4759.57s]  Nice work, everybody.
[4760.29s -> 4764.46s]  Oops, that's the wrong one.
[4764.46s -> 4765.34s]  I want to say you rock.
[4765.98s -> 4770.29s]  Who's your main?
[4770.93s -> 4771.81s]  I really don't have one.
[4772.37s -> 4781.54s]  I'm going to give teamwork to the raw.
[4782.18s -> 4785.18s]  Because that was a very clutch moment in the very end.
[4785.18s -> 4785.68s]  I'm going to burp.
[4788.46s -> 4790.26s]  All right.
[4790.26s -> 4792.80s]  So now, let's see how this works.
[4796.06s -> 4800.62s]  So if I go to play, and I go to custom, okay.
[4800.62s -> 4801.98s]  And I go to create match.
[4802.54s -> 4806.90s]  Match type, assault.
[4806.90s -> 4808.02s]  Let's do an assault.
[4808.02s -> 4809.14s]  Team size 5v5.
[4809.86s -> 4812.34s]  Player pick, there is no...
[4812.34s -> 4813.06s]  It's random pick.
[4813.06s -> 4814.02s]  It's assault.
[4814.02s -> 4814.94s]  Starting level.
[4814.94s -> 4815.74s]  What level did you start at?
[4815.74s -> 4816.86s]  Start at five?
[4816.86s -> 4822.16s]  I think you start at level five, don't you?
[4822.16s -> 4822.80s]  Yeah.
[4822.80s -> 4824.64s]  How much gold do you start with in assault?
[4824.64s -> 4827.02s]  1,500?
[4827.02s -> 4829.33s]  Pause type, no.
[4829.33s -> 4829.73s]  None.
[4829.73s -> 4831.25s]  I'm not going to let anybody just ruin the game
[4831.25s -> 4832.69s]  by just pausing over and over again.
[4832.69s -> 4833.49s]  It's 3k.
[4836.91s -> 4837.95s]  Start with 100,000.
[4837.95s -> 4839.47s]  No, we'll do that later.
[4839.47s -> 4844.61s]  Have you seen the handsome edits of you recently?
[4846.03s -> 4848.40s]  I've seen the handsome photos.
[4848.40s -> 4848.88s]  I haven't seen...
[4848.88s -> 4849.60s]  What do you mean, edits?
[4852.14s -> 4854.62s]  Lane minions, North America, no.
[4855.34s -> 4858.78s]  And low latency, low delay, spectate mode, no.
[4858.78s -> 4860.66s]  No spectators.
[4860.66s -> 4861.70s]  No one's doing that.
[4861.70s -> 4867.36s]  You're going to fucking like kill the server, okay?
[4868.80s -> 4869.28s]  Password.
[4869.84s -> 4872.70s]  All right, this is where...
[4872.70s -> 4873.10s]  I got to...
[4873.10s -> 4877.57s]  Okay, I got to turn the screen off, right?
[4877.57s -> 4880.32s]  Screen has to go off.
[4880.32s -> 4883.26s]  Great match.
[4883.26s -> 4892.96s]  All right, so the password, you can't see it.
[4892.96s -> 4902.93s]  I got to remember the password because it's grayed out.
[4903.49s -> 4911.76s]  Okay, great match.
[4913.17s -> 4916.99s]  All right, so you ready?
[4916.99s -> 4920.18s]  We're doing assault.
[4920.18s -> 4923.09s]  The password is...
[4923.65s -> 4931.38s]  Hello there.
[4931.38s -> 4938.86s]  No spaces, no capitals.
[4938.86s -> 4939.90s]  Didn't take very long at all.
[4940.46s -> 4945.86s]  What are these?
[4945.86s -> 4946.34s]  These are cool.
[4946.34s -> 4947.54s]  Where'd you get these?
[4947.54s -> 4953.55s]  I have what is the equivalent of the Twitter egg.
[4953.55s -> 4956.11s]  All right, you guys ready?
[4956.11s -> 4958.10s]  Let's go.
[4958.10s -> 4969.68s]  I can do Neath.
[4969.68s -> 4971.44s]  I can do Neath, but I remember a little bit.
[4984.98s -> 4986.02s]  Northeast?
[4986.02s -> 4986.50s]  What?
[4986.50s -> 4989.18s]  Is this TOS?
[4989.18s -> 4990.06s]  What, the character?
[4990.86s -> 4992.22s]  What are you talking about?
[4992.22s -> 4995.90s]  Do I have some good players on my team?
[4996.46s -> 4997.58s]  I'm going to get shit on.
[4997.58s -> 4998.14s]  I really am.
[5005.39s -> 5006.43s]  Why are people saying TOS?
[5006.43s -> 5007.39s]  Because I have Neath.
[5007.39s -> 5008.35s]  It's not Neath the character?
[5008.35s -> 5009.71s]  What are you talking about then?
[5009.71s -> 5014.27s]  I don't know.
[5014.27s -> 5015.31s]  How much is this?
[5015.31s -> 5016.98s]  1,200 gems.
[5016.98s -> 5024.22s]  You need to click this.
[5024.22s -> 5024.78s]  Hold on.
[5025.74s -> 5027.18s]  I'm in the middle of a smite game.
[5027.18s -> 5029.82s]  Just relax.
[5029.82s -> 5034.46s]  This is not the game to watch videos in the middle of a game.
[5046.58s -> 5055.81s]  Remember TF2 added a snake.
[5055.81s -> 5056.45s]  Come back.
[5056.45s -> 5061.66s]  Is this a pizza?
[5061.66s -> 5064.14s]  All right, I'm playing with people that are very good at the game,
[5064.14s -> 5064.70s]  I would assume.
[5064.70s -> 5066.06s]  So I have to be careful.
[5066.06s -> 5068.61s]  Watch this shit.
[5069.25s -> 5076.29s]  I'm going to scare the absolute shit out of somebody.
[5076.29s -> 5078.03s]  What does she have?
[5078.03s -> 5078.83s]  She has the backflip.
[5079.47s -> 5080.43s]  I don't even know what that was.
[5080.43s -> 5081.55s]  Okay, I forget her moves.
[5081.55s -> 5082.19s]  Whatever.
[5082.19s -> 5084.02s]  Let's just shoot.
[5084.02s -> 5085.98s]  She's a damage carrier.
[5085.98s -> 5088.54s]  That's fine.
[5088.54s -> 5089.58s]  I want life steal first.
[5090.38s -> 5092.54s]  And then potions are very important right now.
[5095.52s -> 5097.33s]  And potions.
[5098.59s -> 5099.23s]  Oh boy.
[5099.87s -> 5102.96s]  Why does that feel like it's lagging?
[5102.96s -> 5106.83s]  Don't forget the relic.
[5106.83s -> 5107.31s]  Oh dear.
[5108.03s -> 5113.33s]  No, why is that lagging?
[5113.33s -> 5126.19s]  It's not.
[5126.19s -> 5127.07s]  It's just turn speed.
[5127.71s -> 5129.86s]  They're going to die at the tower, right?
[5129.86s -> 5130.58s]  Like they're going to.
[5132.69s -> 5134.53s]  Doesn't she have like an explosion thing where she shoots?
[5138.48s -> 5138.72s]  Whoa.
[5139.36s -> 5141.90s]  All right, this is viewer games.
[5154.10s -> 5154.98s]  Why did I do that?
[5157.25s -> 5159.57s]  I just panicked because we're playing against players that know what they're doing.
[5165.87s -> 5167.39s]  Oh, B.M. B.M. B.M.
[5168.03s -> 5172.30s]  Oh, that guy's.
[5172.30s -> 5172.94s]  That guy dead?
[5173.50s -> 5177.39s]  Oh shit, we have to shoot him like three times.
[5177.95s -> 5182.61s]  Don't think I fucking knew how to do that, did you?
[5183.17s -> 5187.92s]  If only I had my ult.
[5188.48s -> 5199.10s]  B.M. B.M. B.M. B.M. B.M.
[5199.74s -> 5205.63s]  That's not B.M.
[5205.63s -> 5206.75s]  That's like what you do.
[5206.75s -> 5218.67s]  What the fuck is B.M.?
[5220.38s -> 5222.14s]  It stands for bowel movement.
[5222.14s -> 5236.93s]  Or actually bad manners is the other one.
[5236.93s -> 5237.41s]  Good job.
[5239.09s -> 5239.73s]  Not really.
[5241.54s -> 5241.86s]  Shit.
[5241.86s -> 5242.50s]  Oh, I got it.
[5243.58s -> 5244.62s]  Oh no, this is.
[5244.62s -> 5245.18s]  They're going in.
[5245.18s -> 5245.90s]  No, they're not.
[5245.90s -> 5246.70s]  Oh god, run away.
[5247.34s -> 5254.85s]  Oh my.
[5254.85s -> 5257.71s]  What?
[5257.71s -> 5260.88s]  Somebody just killed that guy in the middle of his sentence.
[5267.20s -> 5268.72s]  Oh, he's so close.
[5268.72s -> 5275.86s]  Boy, there's a jungle buff.
[5275.86s -> 5277.06s]  Wait, I don't want to go in there.
[5277.06s -> 5277.70s]  That's dangerous.
[5278.26s -> 5282.32s]  Use your ult.
[5284.10s -> 5285.06s]  I won't kill him if I do.
[5295.44s -> 5296.64s]  Oh shit, you really.
[5296.64s -> 5298.08s]  You thought you were really slick, didn't you?
[5303.92s -> 5306.34s]  Oh god.
[5307.06s -> 5314.48s]  I need mana, I need mana, I need mana.
[5314.48s -> 5316.64s]  Mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana, mana.
[5316.64s -> 5317.44s]  Give me mana, give me mana.
[5317.44s -> 5319.52s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[5319.52s -> 5335.79s]  Oh, at that tower.
[5335.79s -> 5336.59s]  We'll get it.
[5336.67s -> 5341.78s]  Where'd he go?
[5341.78s -> 5346.91s]  Oh, up.
[5346.91s -> 5347.63s]  Cool.
[5347.63s -> 5357.02s]  We can get the tower right now.
[5357.02s -> 5357.58s]  Shit.
[5357.58s -> 5358.94s]  She's got a slow shot.
[5363.33s -> 5364.13s]  Very nice.
[5364.13s -> 5364.69s]  Good.
[5364.69s -> 5370.64s]  What do I, who do I got it?
[5374.64s -> 5376.00s]  That weave through a few people.
[5376.00s -> 5376.96s]  That was pretty good.
[5376.96s -> 5378.16s]  It was actually not that great.
[5379.90s -> 5382.54s]  That was a good little brother kill, I would say.
[5388.75s -> 5389.31s]  Excuse me.
[5397.52s -> 5398.40s]  We're just rolling here.
[5398.96s -> 5399.95s]  Oh my god.
[5400.51s -> 5403.84s]  Good little brother kill, says the little brother.
[5403.84s -> 5404.88s]  Yeah, I mean that.
[5404.88s -> 5405.76s]  I was the little brother.
[5405.76s -> 5406.32s]  That's what I mean.
[5406.96s -> 5409.12s]  That Neath ult was like a you would turn to your little brother
[5409.12s -> 5410.16s]  and say nice job.
[5410.16s -> 5410.64s]  You got him.
[5411.20s -> 5421.22s]  Earth, Earth, Phoenix.
[5421.22s -> 5422.10s]  This is not going to last very long.
[5430.78s -> 5434.46s]  You know why that playing assault in viewer games is actually awesome?
[5434.46s -> 5436.27s]  Because it truly doesn't matter.
[5436.27s -> 5438.03s]  Because it's just five v five team fights.
[5440.70s -> 5442.86s]  It doesn't, I'm not, there's no stream sniping right now.
[5442.86s -> 5444.22s]  It's just a mess in the middle.
[5444.78s -> 5445.42s]  This is great.
[5446.30s -> 5457.17s]  I do need to go.
[5457.17s -> 5458.53s]  I need mana and you can't get mana.
[5458.53s -> 5460.69s]  By the way, if you just don't know what's going on.
[5462.13s -> 5464.45s]  I have to die to buy new items or get mana.
[5464.45s -> 5466.77s]  So sometimes it's actually a pretty good technique just to die.
[5475.42s -> 5487.89s]  Oh, got a guy back here, but it's always an awesome feeling.
[5487.89s -> 5490.77s]  If you can complete a whole assault without going back one time.
[5491.73s -> 5492.29s]  That's great.
[5492.29s -> 5493.17s]  Let's see if I can steal this.
[5494.29s -> 5497.57s]  I don't determine.
[5497.57s -> 5500.80s]  Hey, thank you.
[5500.80s -> 5501.71s]  What?
[5501.71s -> 5511.06s]  Did I miss something?
[5511.06s -> 5518.83s]  Oh, that is just being weird.
[5520.27s -> 5526.50s]  Oh, yeah, this is, I might not have to go back once.
[5526.50s -> 5528.42s]  I'm getting Omega carried.
[5528.42s -> 5536.53s]  That was weird.
[5545.15s -> 5545.71s]  All right, that's fine.
[5545.71s -> 5546.27s]  I'm going to die here.
[5546.91s -> 5549.86s]  See if I can just eat some hits.
[5550.66s -> 5555.65s]  That's fine.
[5555.65s -> 5556.69s]  All right, now I can spend money.
[5558.14s -> 5559.02s]  Lifesteal, lifesteal.
[5559.02s -> 5559.66s]  I want lifesteal.
[5560.22s -> 5571.25s]  This one.
[5572.32s -> 5572.96s]  No, never mind.
[5572.96s -> 5573.84s]  The attack speed.
[5573.84s -> 5583.18s]  Yeah, and this one and potions.
[5592.05s -> 5592.85s]  Found it offline.
[5597.98s -> 5599.26s]  You know, oh, shit, I forgot.
[5599.26s -> 5599.66s]  No, it's all right.
[5599.66s -> 5600.86s]  I got a meditation.
[5600.86s -> 5601.18s]  I'm good.
[5601.18s -> 5601.66s]  I'll be good.
[5604.38s -> 5605.18s]  Purple potion.
[5605.18s -> 5606.78s]  They made a purple potion.
[5606.78s -> 5611.12s]  When did he say he was playing smite?
[5612.53s -> 5613.49s]  I haven't checked.
[5613.49s -> 5615.33s]  Well, if you probably haven't been on the stream for a while.
[5617.01s -> 5619.73s]  I actually became like a pretty much full-time smite streamer.
[5620.29s -> 5624.27s]  Just doing some viewer games hanging out in between kind of competitive matches.
[5634.24s -> 5635.36s]  Did I kill that person?
[5635.36s -> 5635.84s]  I hope so.
[5640.93s -> 5643.66s]  Oh, oh, my God.
[5643.66s -> 5645.90s]  I can't believe I did not die.
[5645.90s -> 5646.70s]  You got to be kidding me.
[5647.26s -> 5656.56s]  This could be the end right here.
[5656.56s -> 5660.67s]  We're going to get the phoenix at least.
[5661.23s -> 5672.22s]  Yeah, that's it.
[5678.35s -> 5680.75s]  We might not kill the titan.
[5680.75s -> 5683.30s]  We'll probably not going to kill the sitan,
[5683.30s -> 5684.90s]  but we'll probably get the phoenix at least.
[5685.54s -> 5685.94s]  Or I don't know.
[5685.94s -> 5686.34s]  Maybe not.
[5686.34s -> 5686.82s]  Let's find out.
[5686.82s -> 5688.82s]  Oh, boy, this is an explosion right here.
[5689.54s -> 5692.10s]  It's just narrating.
[5692.74s -> 5694.74s]  I'm just shout casting my moves.
[5695.54s -> 5699.74s]  I've noticed that when you play a game like this and you're streaming it,
[5701.41s -> 5706.45s]  like the concept of dead air is not a good concept as a streamer, as a broadcaster, right?
[5707.01s -> 5713.54s]  So what ends up happening is you end up just saying what you just did for a move
[5713.54s -> 5715.30s]  or say the move you're about to do.
[5716.18s -> 5719.73s]  Got that one.
[5720.45s -> 5721.41s]  All right, I got to move by one.
[5721.97s -> 5723.70s]  See if I can get an ult here.
[5723.70s -> 5725.30s]  As I'm not even saying any words.
[5727.68s -> 5741.92s]  Oh, we're good.
[5741.92s -> 5743.04s]  Don't you dare do it.
[5743.04s -> 5743.60s]  I'm going to do it.
[5744.82s -> 5745.46s]  I'm going to do it.
[5746.02s -> 5753.09s]  I'm going to do it.
[5759.47s -> 5759.71s]  Hey.
[5766.54s -> 5768.70s]  All right, kill the titan.
[5768.70s -> 5769.82s]  Kill the titan.
[5769.82s -> 5770.38s]  Nice job.
[5771.66s -> 5772.38s]  Nice job.
[5776.85s -> 5778.37s]  Oh, here it comes.
[5778.37s -> 5778.85s]  It's coming.
[5780.38s -> 5783.44s]  Oh, GG, Jeremy.
[5783.44s -> 5790.67s]  You got me into smite and I lost worlds four times.
[5790.67s -> 5791.23s]  Oh, no.
[5797.09s -> 5799.17s]  Hey, but you got to worlds.
[5799.17s -> 5799.97s]  That's crazy.
[5801.09s -> 5808.03s]  The VOD is going to get muted.
[5808.03s -> 5808.51s]  Oh, shit.
[5809.15s -> 5811.23s]  No, it's not.
[5811.23s -> 5812.13s]  It's fine.
[5812.13s -> 5812.45s]  All right.
[5812.45s -> 5819.70s]  Again, the link.
[5819.70s -> 5819.86s]  All right.
[5819.86s -> 5821.22s]  What the hell do you want me to click on?
[5821.22s -> 5822.74s]  What is wrong with you guys?
[5822.74s -> 5829.54s]  What's wrong with you guys?
[5829.54s -> 5838.21s]  This is it, I think.
[5838.21s -> 5838.69s]  What is this?
[5839.49s -> 5845.68s]  This is called Derma Unedited to Andy.
[5845.68s -> 5847.68s]  Why does this have 80,000 views?
[5848.32s -> 5851.74s]  This has 80,000 views.
[5851.74s -> 5854.78s]  It has more views than like a video on the second channel.
[5854.78s -> 5858.13s]  Is this...
[5858.13s -> 5864.86s]  Am I going to get DMCA for this?
[5864.86s -> 5865.26s]  Find out.
[5875.81s -> 5880.66s]  Derma is ugly.
[5887.30s -> 5887.46s]  All right.
[5887.46s -> 5889.49s]  Well, I guess we're going to play it.
[5890.05s -> 5893.33s]  Derma is ugly.
[5893.33s -> 5899.58s]  Let's see what it is.
[5934.43s -> 5935.55s]  John McAfee.
[5936.03s -> 5939.63s]  Okay.
[5941.52s -> 5942.96s]  Well, thanks for the video.
[5942.96s -> 5944.08s]  I appreciate it.
[5944.08s -> 5947.47s]  Thank you.
[5948.03s -> 5949.84s]  That was a good video.
[5950.40s -> 5954.19s]  Let's go ahead and do this again.
[5954.75s -> 5956.35s]  Do another assault.
[5956.35s -> 5959.95s]  Five to five, same thing.
[5959.95s -> 5963.36s]  We're going to do a game of conquest, too.
[5963.36s -> 5964.24s]  And I'm going to...
[5964.24s -> 5965.36s]  It's going to be bad.
[5965.36s -> 5969.36s]  Okay, random pick.
[5969.36s -> 5970.16s]  No pausing.
[5970.16s -> 5972.27s]  Get out of here.
[5972.27s -> 5974.03s]  Don't allow spectators.
[5974.03s -> 5975.15s]  And the password is...
[5975.63s -> 5979.92s]  Well, it's like blocked out anyway, so you don't know.
[5979.92s -> 5984.08s]  Wrong game mode?
[5984.08s -> 5985.28s]  Oh, shit.
[5985.28s -> 5987.63s]  All right.
[5987.63s -> 5988.59s]  Password is going to be...
[5989.31s -> 6001.73s]  How do I spell this?
[6003.70s -> 6004.10s]  All right.
[6004.10s -> 6004.58s]  Let's go.
[6006.58s -> 6007.54s]  Password is...
[6008.26s -> 6009.14s]  I will tell you.
[6010.78s -> 6011.90s]  Make us guess the password.
[6017.65s -> 6019.82s]  The password's Aaron, okay?
[6019.82s -> 6021.98s]  Yeah, I guess you guys got it before saying anything.
[6022.62s -> 6022.94s]  What?
[6022.94s -> 6023.26s]  All right.
[6023.26s -> 6024.46s]  Well, good job.
[6024.46s -> 6024.94s]  Let's go.
[6027.39s -> 6028.19s]  It was Aaron.
[6035.87s -> 6036.19s]  How do I...
[6036.19s -> 6037.55s]  I forget how you play, Agni.
[6037.55s -> 6040.53s]  I can probably do it, though.
[6040.53s -> 6042.69s]  You just do the gigantic meteors on people?
[6047.14s -> 6047.46s]  Say it.
[6047.46s -> 6048.26s]  Say what?
[6048.26s -> 6051.92s]  Thank you for Smite Thursdays.
[6051.92s -> 6052.32s]  You're the best.
[6052.32s -> 6053.92s]  Hope to see more content like this soon.
[6057.60s -> 6058.16s]  Oh, my God.
[6058.16s -> 6059.44s]  I completely fucking forgot.
[6059.44s -> 6063.76s]  I completely forgot.
[6063.76s -> 6066.40s]  I have to tweet this out, I think.
[6066.40s -> 6067.34s]  But...
[6067.34s -> 6068.54s]  So, I was...
[6069.58s -> 6071.10s]  This is a long story.
[6071.10s -> 6073.54s]  Okay, this is going to have to be after the...
[6075.17s -> 6075.41s]  Yeah.
[6075.41s -> 6077.65s]  This is going to have to be after the match here.
[6077.65s -> 6083.09s]  This is a long story.
[6083.09s -> 6094.85s]  Yeah, we'll talk about this later.
[6094.85s -> 6095.49s]  Do it during...
[6095.49s -> 6095.97s]  No, I can't.
[6097.41s -> 6099.57s]  After this match, I'm going to take a second and I'm going to show you.
[6099.57s -> 6104.93s]  So, I was a little high.
[6104.93s -> 6107.01s]  I was, you know, just did a little bit.
[6108.26s -> 6110.18s]  A couple nights, maybe a few nights ago, maybe.
[6110.18s -> 6111.38s]  I don't remember exactly what it was.
[6113.31s -> 6113.87s]  I was a little...
[6114.67s -> 6115.95s]  And so, I did something.
[6115.95s -> 6120.05s]  I did something weird that it's hard for me to explain.
[6120.69s -> 6123.17s]  A few days later, I'm thinking back.
[6123.17s -> 6126.29s]  And what was the point of me doing this is the question that I had.
[6127.65s -> 6129.33s]  It's a long, embarrassing story.
[6129.33s -> 6132.00s]  So, I'll tell you after this.
[6132.00s -> 6137.41s]  What do I want to do for moves?
[6137.41s -> 6137.89s]  What do these do?
[6137.89s -> 6139.25s]  All right, that's the dash.
[6139.25s -> 6141.10s]  That's the fire.
[6141.10s -> 6141.74s]  Probably the fire.
[6146.58s -> 6148.82s]  Don't do that shit in the streamer's ear.
[6150.11s -> 6151.55s]  Don't do that in the streamer's ear.
[6159.74s -> 6160.78s]  It's not even embarrassing.
[6160.78s -> 6162.98s]  It's just like...
[6162.98s -> 6164.82s]  At this point, you guys should expect it.
[6164.82s -> 6175.23s]  All right, so it's the...
[6175.23s -> 6177.20s]  You get four of these, right?
[6177.20s -> 6179.44s]  And you really want to put the gas down.
[6179.44s -> 6180.80s]  Because there is gas.
[6180.80s -> 6183.04s]  You put the gas down, you ignite them.
[6183.04s -> 6183.60s]  And then you go...
[6185.76s -> 6190.11s]  You throw up no more Oreos?
[6190.11s -> 6190.51s]  No.
[6190.51s -> 6193.22s]  Let me see if I can describe this.
[6193.22s -> 6194.50s]  So, I played...
[6194.50s -> 6194.90s]  I don't...
[6195.46s -> 6199.42s]  When I'm lying in bed, sometimes I do things
[6200.06s -> 6202.46s]  that are just a way for me to pass some time
[6202.46s -> 6204.54s]  before falling asleep and just relaxing.
[6204.54s -> 6206.86s]  And having the iPad in bed is very, very easy.
[6206.86s -> 6208.82s]  There's also an app store.
[6208.82s -> 6212.02s]  And I download and play just random shit all the time.
[6212.02s -> 6214.10s]  Even if it's stupid, even if it sucks.
[6214.10s -> 6214.98s]  It doesn't matter.
[6214.98s -> 6216.10s]  It doesn't matter what the game is.
[6216.10s -> 6218.34s]  If it's new on the app store, I usually get it and just go,
[6218.34s -> 6220.10s]  oh, okay, play for 10 minutes.
[6220.10s -> 6221.06s]  And then fall asleep.
[6221.06s -> 6225.63s]  So, I downloaded Cookie Run Kingdom.
[6225.63s -> 6230.18s]  Because Cookie Run Kingdom did this thing
[6230.18s -> 6235.52s]  where they hired every North American voice actor ever
[6235.52s -> 6237.92s]  to be a hundred characters in the game.
[6237.92s -> 6238.88s]  And I was like, what the fuck?
[6238.88s -> 6239.52s]  That's crazy.
[6240.48s -> 6242.96s]  So, I downloaded it and I played it.
[6243.68s -> 6248.00s]  Remember, I had had a little bit of THC, right?
[6248.64s -> 6249.71s]  Hold on a second.
[6249.71s -> 6250.59s]  I gotta fuck shit up.
[6251.31s -> 6253.12s]  Hold on a second.
[6253.12s -> 6254.08s]  Let me just fuck shit up.
[6258.08s -> 6259.44s]  Oh, let me just chill out a minute.
[6261.49s -> 6264.37s]  So, I'm playing Cookie Run Kingdom.
[6266.61s -> 6269.89s]  And I thought of this idea.
[6270.93s -> 6272.69s]  And I thought it was a brilliant idea.
[6272.69s -> 6277.12s]  I was like, holy shit, I have a great game, video game idea.
[6277.12s -> 6283.20s]  And I opened up my notepad on my iPad and just started typing.
[6283.20s -> 6287.22s]  And what I typed is bizarre.
[6287.22s -> 6289.30s]  And I tried to break it down a little bit.
[6289.30s -> 6291.94s]  And it's just truly weird what I wrote.
[6291.94s -> 6296.22s]  But this was my idea for a video game.
[6296.22s -> 6301.02s]  And I took a screenshot of this to remember it.
[6301.02s -> 6304.64s]  Not with the iPad, with my phone.
[6304.64s -> 6307.44s]  I held my phone up to take a picture of the screen.
[6307.44s -> 6315.73s]  So, I would remember it.
[6315.73s -> 6316.93s]  How high were you?
[6316.93s -> 6317.73s]  Not really.
[6317.73s -> 6319.33s]  It was just like, I was just kind of relaxed.
[6322.62s -> 6326.45s]  I could say it, but I think it's better for you to read it.
[6326.45s -> 6330.22s]  But that's the context.
[6340.18s -> 6348.80s]  Ooh, so fun to do that with Agony.
[6348.80s -> 6349.52s]  Oh, I got it.
[6356.05s -> 6357.65s]  You just sit in the back and just drop bombs.
[6360.96s -> 6361.92s]  Nice, very nice.
[6368.10s -> 6369.22s]  Oh, what are you doing?
[6371.50s -> 6383.89s]  You said you only really do edibles.
[6383.89s -> 6387.01s]  Well, I do tinctures and edibles.
[6387.01s -> 6387.97s]  I don't smoke.
[6387.97s -> 6390.93s]  Tinctures are really easy to do.
[6390.93s -> 6393.17s]  Like a cup, just two or three milligrams and that's it.
[6393.73s -> 6395.25s]  Just to kind of relax on the couch.
[6399.18s -> 6403.34s]  I don't, this is not, I'm not condoning anybody doing any type of drugs.
[6404.93s -> 6414.40s]  Described my reasoning for why I do, sometimes, THC, marijuana.
[6414.40s -> 6418.56s]  It actually is one of the things that helps incredibly for me, personally.
[6418.56s -> 6421.82s]  I'm gonna do a little bit for the pain bullshit.
[6421.82s -> 6422.82s]  There you go.
[6422.82s -> 6427.65s]  It's a, we're in a progressive decade, Jeremy.
[6427.65s -> 6431.49s]  You don't have to, well, so drugs are, no, I don't,
[6432.05s -> 6433.49s]  I would say the same thing about alcohol.
[6441.10s -> 6442.62s]  The whole point with Agony is just being annoying.
[6443.26s -> 6444.32s]  Oh my goodness.
[6445.04s -> 6449.22s]  Oh fuck, I'm doing bad.
[6449.22s -> 6452.42s]  All right, I'm paying too much attention to like telling you guys a dumb story.
[6453.30s -> 6461.09s]  My little brother just heard you.
[6461.73s -> 6462.45s]  I want to read that.
[6463.63s -> 6467.79s]  My little brother just heard you use drugs and he already got two kilograms of meth.
[6467.79s -> 6473.04s]  Please next time instead say math books to trick him.
[6473.04s -> 6475.52s]  You have to click that you're over 18 to watch the stream.
[6475.52s -> 6482.18s]  So, excuse me.
[6482.18s -> 6485.06s]  Or mature audience warning, right?
[6485.06s -> 6493.63s]  He's not watching his little brother just heard.
[6493.63s -> 6498.27s]  Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have the TV so loud while you're watching The Sopranos.
[6498.27s -> 6501.41s]  Because I remember that used to happen to me.
[6501.41s -> 6505.17s]  I remember being in my house and my dad watching The Sopranos in the other room.
[6505.17s -> 6509.49s]  And he'd be like, oh, you fucking idiot, you fucking guy, stupid fucking.
[6509.49s -> 6512.69s]  And I would be in the other room and I would kind of walk out and he'd be like,
[6512.69s -> 6514.61s]  hey, hey, hey, hey, you shouldn't be in here.
[6515.49s -> 6518.85s]  It's like, well, you watch it at like fucking 80% volume.
[6534.43s -> 6535.55s]  Ooh, kill.
[6542.34s -> 6544.26s]  Oh, let's be fucking cheeky here.
[6549.01s -> 6551.01s]  Oh, I had the idea halfway through.
[6551.01s -> 6551.51s]  Shit.
[6552.13s -> 6554.90s]  I was going to put the gas down and stun him,
[6554.90s -> 6559.06s]  but I had the idea to do that when I was like at the last second.
[6559.06s -> 6559.56s]  Shit.
[6560.20s -> 6569.25s]  Oh, oh, god damn it.
[6569.25s -> 6569.49s]  All right.
[6569.49s -> 6576.61s]  This is not a great game right now.
[6576.61s -> 6580.21s]  Yeah, I remember specifically, I remember my dad would watch The Sopranos
[6580.21s -> 6584.64s]  and I would walk in the room and he would just like change back.
[6585.20s -> 6586.96s]  I don't know if the remotes still have this,
[6587.52s -> 6591.57s]  but remotes had this thing called like the last channel button
[6591.57s -> 6593.97s]  where if you pressed it, it would just kind of,
[6593.97s -> 6600.63s]  it's like when you pressed Q in Team Fortress or an FPS and it goes to your last weapon.
[6600.63s -> 6604.87s]  He would just press Q on his keyboard essentially and switch to like the news.
[6605.67s -> 6609.41s]  So I would walk in the room and I would hear like,
[6609.41s -> 6610.45s]  let me tell you something.
[6610.45s -> 6612.21s]  You are, the local weather today,
[6612.21s -> 6614.29s]  we're going to be having some sunny sunshine outside.
[6615.09s -> 6618.05s]  And of course, make sure you go to the rat festival next week.
[6618.05s -> 6619.75s]  That's what would happen every time.
[6619.75s -> 6622.23s]  I would leave the room and it'd be like,
[6622.23s -> 6624.79s]  oh, yeah, Janet, that's a very good quit.
[6624.79s -> 6625.43s]  Fuck it, idiot.
[6626.15s -> 6629.06s]  Get him, shoot him in the fucking head.
[6629.06s -> 6632.50s]  Shoot him in the, last night, a cat snuck up into the,
[6633.06s -> 6634.82s]  it was switched so weirdly between the two of them
[6634.82s -> 6636.26s]  that it was so confusing to pay attention to.
[6637.62s -> 6639.06s]  I don't even know how he enjoyed the show
[6639.06s -> 6640.34s]  because he had to do that all the time.
[6649.41s -> 6652.68s]  No, this is a bullshit story.
[6652.68s -> 6654.68s]  This is not a bullshit story.
[6654.68s -> 6667.41s]  I swear to God, you were very good at this game.
[6667.97s -> 6672.34s]  Um, yeah, what do you say now?
[6672.34s -> 6675.54s]  I killed the guy with two centimeters of health left.
[6680.37s -> 6682.45s]  Look, I'm also in like story Andy mode,
[6682.45s -> 6694.66s]  which means I can't play the video game.
[6694.66s -> 6696.26s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't hurt me.
[6696.26s -> 6701.01s]  All right, I'm going way too hard here.
[6701.57s -> 6709.80s]  Why was your dad afraid of swear words when you were 20?
[6711.88s -> 6713.64s]  I was not 20, I was like fucking,
[6713.64s -> 6714.52s]  I was like 15.
[6715.16s -> 6718.00s]  When did the Sopranos come out?
[6718.00s -> 6733.96s]  Sopranos original release date was, uh, when was it?
[6733.96s -> 6736.40s]  1997?
[6738.44s -> 6739.48s]  How old was I?
[6739.48s -> 6742.53s]  Oh, 30?
[6742.53s -> 6744.13s]  Okay, hold on, I gotta, shit.
[6745.09s -> 6754.18s]  I wasn't 30.
[6754.18s -> 6755.78s]  How old was I in 1997?
[6759.99s -> 6761.03s]  Help them, I know.
[6761.99s -> 6764.04s]  Look, they knew what they were signing up for.
[6764.04s -> 6765.56s]  They're playing with a streamer.
[6765.56s -> 6769.49s]  They're playing with a streamer who's not very good at this.
[6769.49s -> 6770.77s]  I think they know what they're getting into.
[6776.82s -> 6780.04s]  Oh, you were 12.
[6780.04s -> 6790.05s]  Okay, so those of you that said that I was 20,
[6791.00s -> 6792.20s]  I was like 13.
[6803.24s -> 6805.40s]  12 is fine for swearing.
[6806.64s -> 6820.69s]  Okay, well, uh, look, when you raise your kids,
[6821.25s -> 6823.78s]  I, hold on, god damn it.
[6823.78s -> 6824.90s]  I was so greedy, but I think I got it.
[6833.52s -> 6835.28s]  Ah, come on, I need to get that.
[6836.08s -> 6838.16s]  Whoa, look out, it's Jormungandir.
[6838.72s -> 6845.38s]  They're going to be swearing by 12 whether you like it or not.
[6848.96s -> 6852.16s]  Okay, all I'm saying is that when I was like 12 years old,
[6853.46s -> 6856.10s]  my parents didn't want me to watch like fucking,
[6856.82s -> 6859.30s]  it's the mafia guys shoot each other in the head.
[6859.30s -> 6861.46s]  Okay, what are we having?
[6861.46s -> 6862.26s]  What are you talking about?
[6880.55s -> 6884.15s]  Internet generation versus Jormungandir who didn't swear until he was 40.
[6892.53s -> 6905.76s]  You guys, I'm 26 and I still don't swear in front of my parents.
[6907.24s -> 6908.52s]  Look, I don't know.
[6909.32s -> 6915.38s]  I wasn't allowed to watch R rated movies until like later on in my teen years.
[6915.38s -> 6916.42s]  Is that so bizarre?
[6929.91s -> 6930.87s]  No, not really.
[6930.87s -> 6931.75s]  It's pretty normal.
[6942.15s -> 6943.99s]  Fake Jormungandir doesn't even look like the one from,
[6945.11s -> 6949.28s]  I don't know why I was going to say guilds of war, god of war.
[6949.84s -> 6970.16s]  I don't know why I'm just trying to stun people that are not over here.
[6980.04s -> 6981.72s]  Oh, they're close.
[6986.05s -> 6987.33s]  I don't even care if I die.
[6987.33s -> 6988.37s]  I don't even care if I die.
[6989.25s -> 6989.81s]  Damn it.
[6991.80s -> 6995.57s]  I thought they were going to run to the right, not left, to try to juke me.
[6996.29s -> 7010.56s]  We're going in.
[7010.56s -> 7011.60s]  It looks like we're going in.
[7012.32s -> 7013.38s]  It looks like we're going in.
[7016.64s -> 7017.28s]  Oh, shit.
[7028.95s -> 7034.37s]  Good, good.
[7034.37s -> 7035.43s]  Keep it up.
[7035.43s -> 7049.54s]  Get him on the run.
[7049.54s -> 7057.73s]  Why is he playing this boomer game?
[7059.41s -> 7061.17s]  I don't know what any terminology is anymore.
[7061.73s -> 7073.20s]  I don't know any of this terminology is.
[7074.20s -> 7074.92s]  So over my head.
[7081.60s -> 7090.12s]  Oh, you're in trouble now.
[7090.12s -> 7091.24s]  We really pulled this back.
[7091.24s -> 7091.88s]  We were losing.
[7096.77s -> 7097.57s]  We were losing.
[7109.81s -> 7113.00s]  Sorry, my sacrifice is mine.
[7113.00s -> 7120.23s]  No, we already went over this.
[7120.23s -> 7123.43s]  You can't say this is the worst stream because you don't like the game.
[7123.43s -> 7126.07s]  That's not how that works.
[7126.07s -> 7129.67s]  This would be worst stream if it took me an hour of technical problems to get here.
[7130.56s -> 7133.20s]  And then we didn't talk about anything fun.
[7133.20s -> 7136.24s]  And like, I'm not having a good time and the game sucks.
[7136.24s -> 7138.56s]  Well, I mean, if you don't just because you don't like the game
[7138.56s -> 7140.80s]  does not make it a contender for worst stream 2021.
[7140.80s -> 7143.04s]  That's just your personal preference for video games.
[7143.92s -> 7144.56s]  Excuse me.
[7145.28s -> 7154.90s]  Is that a hairball?
[7154.90s -> 7155.62s]  Yeah.
[7155.62s -> 7160.56s]  Come on, Ra.
[7160.56s -> 7161.94s]  Do I have enough money for anything?
[7161.94s -> 7164.02s]  Why did I buy the Rod of Tahootie right now?
[7164.02s -> 7166.82s]  God, you know, we play smite, us gamers.
[7167.78s -> 7169.14s]  If you know, if you know, you know.
[7169.30s -> 7171.62s]  Why do they get Rod of Tahootie as my fourth item?
[7172.42s -> 7173.89s]  It's my gamers.
[7173.89s -> 7178.76s]  No, this is the worst thing you can stream.
[7182.29s -> 7183.01s]  I disagree.
[7183.97s -> 7195.32s]  Holy shit.
[7195.32s -> 7196.36s]  I didn't even know you were here.
[7196.36s -> 7199.56s]  What the fuck?
[7199.56s -> 7200.20s]  Oh, my God.
[7200.20s -> 7201.72s]  I just came out of nowhere.
[7201.72s -> 7205.72s]  Yeah.
[7205.72s -> 7206.28s]  Holy shit.
[7206.28s -> 7207.08s]  I wasn't paying attention.
[7207.80s -> 7209.08s]  I'm reading chat.
[7209.08s -> 7210.04s]  I should just delete chat.
[7217.35s -> 7218.63s]  Read the iPad thing.
[7218.63s -> 7220.63s]  Actually, let me get this on like Discord so I can link to it.
[7221.27s -> 7227.81s]  Oh, I got 24 seconds.
[7227.81s -> 7228.53s]  Nice.
[7228.53s -> 7229.65s]  That's enough time.
[7229.65s -> 7243.28s]  That's enough time.
[7243.84s -> 7245.97s]  Now, let me get this on screen.
[7246.69s -> 7248.39s]  Because I think this is going to be over in a minute.
[7249.11s -> 7253.11s]  Shit, I got to hold on.
[7253.11s -> 7254.63s]  Do I have any money?
[7257.27s -> 7264.13s]  Why don't you do the hangout portions of the stream anymore?
[7264.13s -> 7264.93s]  OK, hold on.
[7264.93s -> 7265.65s]  This is important.
[7267.65s -> 7270.37s]  I'm reading the fucking chat room.
[7274.63s -> 7275.99s]  It's like you can't, OK, this game,
[7275.99s -> 7279.19s]  you can't just like turn your head to the left and just read it.
[7279.91s -> 7281.43s]  I just lost us the game.
[7282.07s -> 7291.19s]  OK, anyways.
[7291.19s -> 7296.47s]  Yeah, Chad, why are you talking?
[7296.47s -> 7297.43s]  You just lost us the game.
[7297.43s -> 7298.39s]  What the hell?
[7300.12s -> 7302.28s]  All right, let me let me get this thing.
[7304.66s -> 7312.64s]  Hey, I want to put this on screen and we're going to get
[7312.64s -> 7313.36s]  I'm going to give you a second to read.
[7313.36s -> 7315.36s]  Remember, I'll give you a little bit more context.
[7315.36s -> 7324.28s]  It's there.
[7324.28s -> 7324.84s]  Is it there?
[7329.22s -> 7336.60s]  OK, so context wise, again, don't do context.
[7337.32s -> 7338.68s]  I have to do at least some context.
[7347.76s -> 7351.19s]  This is oh, this is kind of blurry.
[7351.19s -> 7352.63s]  All right, can you guys be able to see this shit?
[7353.19s -> 7359.62s]  Why is this so huge?
[7360.18s -> 7364.47s]  OK, context again.
[7365.11s -> 7369.91s]  This is I was high and I was playing Cookie Run Kingdom
[7369.91s -> 7373.12s]  and I had a brilliant idea for a video game
[7373.12s -> 7375.04s]  like the storyline of a video game.
[7375.04s -> 7376.68s]  I'm not going to say anything.
[7376.68s -> 7378.04s]  I'm just going to let you read it
[7378.04s -> 7379.56s]  and we're going to show it right now.
[7379.56s -> 7400.15s]  This is just the Avengers, but they're evil.
[7400.15s -> 7404.28s]  A party of Earth's five, weren't there six Avengers?
[7404.28s -> 7408.04s]  A party of Earth's five most powerful heroes.
[7408.04s -> 7410.44s]  Heroes storms the enemy's base.
[7410.44s -> 7413.41s]  They defeat the ultimate villain and claim the castle.
[7413.41s -> 7415.49s]  These are the antagonists of the game.
[7415.49s -> 7425.68s]  They become evil soon after.
[7425.68s -> 7427.12s]  Are you eight years old?
[7427.12s -> 7432.74s]  This is an AI.
[7432.74s -> 7434.26s]  Yeah, that's like Talk to Transformer.
[7436.85s -> 7441.40s]  And I took the screenshot.
[7441.40s -> 7442.60s]  This is me taking a screen.
[7442.60s -> 7447.44s]  Like I held the camera from the phone up to the screen
[7447.44s -> 7449.84s]  and press snap camera button.
[7449.84s -> 7458.05s]  There's a dog hair on the screen.
[7464.80s -> 7467.28s]  There are like five dog hairs.
[7469.16s -> 7470.92s]  Oh my God, look at them all.
[7470.92s -> 7472.68s]  There's one, two, three, four.
[7472.68s -> 7475.94s]  There are like five or six dog hairs.
[7475.94s -> 7478.98s]  A party of Earth's five most powerful dog hairs.
[7478.98s -> 7486.50s]  Well, there you go.
[7486.50s -> 7487.70s]  That was my brilliant idea.
[7488.90s -> 7491.78s]  By the way, Hi Me wants 5% of royalties
[7491.78s -> 7493.78s]  from all the money you make from that awesome video game.
[7499.32s -> 7500.28s]  Let's play another one.
[7500.28s -> 7503.65s]  All right, we're going to do one more assault
[7504.82s -> 7506.18s]  and then we're going to move.
[7506.18s -> 7508.26s]  We're going to play a game of conquest one
[7508.26s -> 7509.78s]  and it's going to be horrible and I'm going to hate it.
[7509.78s -> 7513.86s]  The game's already been made.
[7513.86s -> 7522.48s]  All right, we're going to play a game called Guess the Password.
[7522.48s -> 7533.11s]  I'm going to make it easy for you.
[7533.67s -> 7541.57s]  Let's see if you get it.
[7541.57s -> 7543.19s]  Here we go.
[7553.44s -> 7554.08s]  Somebody got it.
[7554.93s -> 7559.43s]  Wow, that's actually surprising.
[7563.32s -> 7564.68s]  That's really surprising.
[7565.88s -> 7567.48s]  More of you get it now.
[7567.48s -> 7570.53s]  I mean, there's a lot of people here.
[7570.53s -> 7574.69s]  The password is susguy with no spaces, no capitals.
[7574.69s -> 7579.70s]  Do Fortnite Friday.
[7579.70s -> 7582.47s]  No, I don't think that's what we're going to do.
[7589.08s -> 7590.04s]  After this, we're going to take a break.
[7590.60s -> 7592.85s]  I'm going to get some water, maybe another coffee and I'll come back.
[7593.41s -> 7602.74s]  This time I'm actually going to.
[7602.74s -> 7603.94s]  That's so loud.
[7603.94s -> 7608.21s]  Okay, I kind of know how to play 100 bots.
[7608.85s -> 7609.97s]  Not really though.
[7609.97s -> 7615.78s]  I want to really pay attention to this one.
[7615.78s -> 7617.99s]  So this is going to be a gamer match.
[7619.62s -> 7622.18s]  What that means is I'm not going to be talking to chat really.
[7622.18s -> 7623.46s]  I'm going to be focusing.
[7623.46s -> 7627.96s]  This is going to be a gamer one.
[7627.96s -> 7632.16s]  Why are you not playing Dota?
[7632.16s -> 7644.87s]  I think the difference between Dota and Smite for me is one requires an entire lesson plan.
[7644.87s -> 7649.67s]  One really requires you to do a full class with a professor for a year
[7650.23s -> 7653.97s]  before you're comfortable really playing the game against people.
[7653.97s -> 7660.90s]  You guys think that in the future there'll be classes for video games?
[7660.90s -> 7663.33s]  Before you laugh at me.
[7663.33s -> 7666.29s]  Everybody laughed at me when I said that gaming would be in the Olympics.
[7666.29s -> 7670.29s]  Remember five to ten years ago when I made that video?
[7670.29s -> 7672.87s]  Everybody laughed at me.
[7672.87s -> 7675.03s]  Do you think that in some of like the most prestigious colleges
[7675.03s -> 7678.08s]  there will be League of Legends classes?
[7678.08s -> 7689.41s]  They already exist now.
[7689.41s -> 7692.63s]  Okay, well, all right.
[7692.63s -> 7694.92s]  All right, here we go.
[7695.56s -> 7696.44s]  All right, quiet.
[7697.08s -> 7698.79s]  You know, just put me on in the background.
[7698.79s -> 7699.99s]  Just chill for a little bit.
[7699.99s -> 7700.71s]  We're going to hang out.
[7700.71s -> 7706.88s]  Just have me on in another tab while you're in your League of Legends course.
[7706.88s -> 7718.93s]  Okay, I want.
[7718.93s -> 7721.33s]  Do you people build pun bats?
[7721.33s -> 7722.21s]  Tanky?
[7722.21s -> 7723.49s]  Do they?
[7723.49s -> 7726.98s]  What do they have?
[7726.98s -> 7728.82s]  That's so much physical.
[7729.54s -> 7731.86s]  Yeah, I got to get a physical protection.
[7731.86s -> 7736.23s]  Any of these physical?
[7737.99s -> 7738.39s]  Magic?
[7739.28s -> 7740.88s]  No, I need physical.
[7740.88s -> 7742.47s]  We'll do the cool down one.
[7743.65s -> 7744.29s]  Okay, that's good.
[7744.93s -> 7747.76s]  What's the weather like in Vegas?
[7747.76s -> 7749.36s]  It's actually really nice recently.
[7749.36s -> 7754.24s]  It's cooled down quite a bit.
[7754.24s -> 7755.04s]  Okay, everybody.
[7755.04s -> 7755.52s]  Here we go.
[7755.52s -> 7756.96s]  Time for a gamer stream.
[7756.96s -> 7775.28s]  Good luck.
[7775.28s -> 7775.92s]  Thank you.
[7775.92s -> 7776.32s]  Here we go.
[7776.96s -> 7782.48s]  I'm going to play as if no one's watching.
[7806.28s -> 7824.04s]  Never to jump up.
[7824.04s -> 7833.41s]  Don't shoot me.
[7833.41s -> 7847.73s]  Nope.
[7847.73s -> 7849.17s]  Oh, good grab.
[7853.14s -> 7854.02s]  I didn't capitalize.
[7858.61s -> 7859.57s]  The streamer gets that.
[7859.57s -> 7860.13s]  I'm the streamer.
[7860.13s -> 7864.16s]  I get it.
[7864.16s -> 7873.51s]  Sobek is godlike.
[7873.51s -> 7877.16s]  I don't think the Sobek has missed one pull.
[7877.16s -> 7879.27s]  And he's just talking.
[7879.27s -> 7881.27s]  He's just like monologuing.
[7881.27s -> 7883.11s]  This Sobek is also streaming.
[7883.11s -> 7884.24s]  See?
[7884.24s -> 7889.14s]  And what a distraction that was, wasn't it?
[7889.14s -> 7890.58s]  Wasn't that quite a distraction?
[7890.58s -> 7895.16s]  I have no mana.
[7895.16s -> 7910.18s]  What are you beeping?
[7910.18s -> 7915.30s]  Thank you.
[7916.98s -> 7917.70s]  Thank you so much.
[7917.70s -> 7919.76s]  I've loved your stream, by the way.
[7919.76s -> 7921.20s]  I love Sobek gaming.
[7921.20s -> 7934.28s]  I get all these tips and tricks.
[7934.28s -> 7935.80s]  Ooh, you always got them.
[7935.80s -> 7936.36s]  That was close.
[7939.27s -> 7940.39s]  I wish I could go in.
[7940.39s -> 7941.43s]  I think I'm just going to go in and die.
[7942.55s -> 7943.59s]  Yeah, this is the time to do it.
[7944.15s -> 7954.10s]  This is the time to just die and get a few hits.
[7954.10s -> 7954.82s]  Okay, I got somebody.
[7959.16s -> 7960.52s]  Shit, I don't have enough money.
[7960.52s -> 7970.69s]  Turn up the game volume?
[7971.33s -> 7972.60s]  Oh, if I'm not going to be talking,
[7972.60s -> 7973.72s]  then yeah, you should be able to hear more.
[7974.52s -> 7985.40s]  Bro, it's weird to see you play against regular players.
[7986.04s -> 7987.33s]  What do you mean?
[7987.33s -> 7994.88s]  There's no way I'm going to turn on voice chat.
[7997.03s -> 8000.02s]  Zero percent chance.
[8000.02s -> 8000.66s]  All right, quiet.
[8020.13s -> 8026.98s]  I'll set around.
[8026.98s -> 8027.62s]  Ace cam?
[8027.62s -> 8028.98s]  No, stop distracting me.
[8029.54s -> 8037.25s]  I heard a cool video game sound.
[8041.12s -> 8041.52s]  You get that.
[8041.52s -> 8042.24s]  I don't need it.
[8042.24s -> 8050.96s]  Oh, shit.
[8064.84s -> 8065.32s]  Ace cam.
[8065.32s -> 8066.04s]  I don't have a shirt on.
[8066.04s -> 8066.92s]  I can't put a face cam on.
[8066.92s -> 8067.24s]  Sorry.
[8067.80s -> 8074.77s]  Come on, I'm 0 and 2.
[8074.77s -> 8075.65s]  This is stupid.
[8081.48s -> 8082.28s]  All right, I'm going to do the thing
[8082.28s -> 8083.88s]  that is really frowned upon
[8083.88s -> 8085.24s]  and that stands still in spawn
[8085.24s -> 8086.52s]  so you can complete your item.
[8086.52s -> 8089.70s]  See how it works.
[8106.29s -> 8107.41s]  Ooh, full body cam.
[8107.41s -> 8108.45s]  Nobody does that, do they?
[8111.86s -> 8114.42s]  Is there a streamer that has a full body cam,
[8114.42s -> 8115.62s]  not just a head face cam?
[8118.15s -> 8119.75s]  They're sitting here playing a game
[8119.75s -> 8121.11s]  and they just have an entire body cam?
[8121.67s -> 8124.31s]  I'm talking head to toe.
[8124.95s -> 8138.93s]  Nice job.
[8138.93s -> 8140.21s]  It's perfectly aligned to make it
[8140.21s -> 8141.73s]  so they're always in frame,
[8141.73s -> 8142.85s]  their whole standing body.
[8143.49s -> 8148.00s]  We going in?
[8149.17s -> 8150.61s]  Oh, I think we're going in.
[8150.61s -> 8151.49s]  I think we're going in.
[8162.50s -> 8164.15s]  Oh, they're all so close.
[8166.93s -> 8167.81s]  Oh, they're all so close.
[8167.81s -> 8168.37s]  All right, let's go.
[8169.01s -> 8178.58s]  Oh, kill him.
[8183.24s -> 8184.84s]  Oh, he's so low, this tier.
[8184.84s -> 8185.48s]  God damn it.
[8190.23s -> 8190.95s]  I didn't feed.
[8190.95s -> 8191.99s]  I did a lot of work.
[8191.99s -> 8193.84s]  What are we throwing?
[8193.84s -> 8194.32s]  What?
[8194.32s -> 8195.36s]  We killed like three people.
[8201.40s -> 8202.60s]  I can't make decisions on my own
[8202.60s -> 8203.80s]  so I just pick what other people pick.
[8204.36s -> 8210.72s]  What should I do?
[8215.48s -> 8215.88s]  Fuck.
[8215.88s -> 8216.52s]  Um, this one.
[8226.39s -> 8229.16s]  Jeremy, please, I need to know
[8229.16s -> 8231.24s]  who your favorite smite character's ass is.
[8231.80s -> 8235.49s]  Do you think the first time you said
[8235.49s -> 8236.61s]  that I was going to give you a response?
[8237.17s -> 8239.08s]  I'm that person enough for five seconds.
[8246.95s -> 8247.27s]  Nope.
[8248.47s -> 8254.16s]  Just got to defend.
[8254.16s -> 8255.44s]  This is anybody's game.
[8255.44s -> 8256.32s]  We have a lot more kills
[8256.32s -> 8257.28s]  and a lot more money than they do,
[8257.28s -> 8258.00s]  but that's fine.
[8258.00s -> 8259.67s]  Is that a capo?
[8259.67s -> 8260.76s]  You do emotes?
[8261.32s -> 8267.60s]  He's just going in.
[8269.51s -> 8271.43s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[8271.43s -> 8272.39s]  I don't know if that's a good idea.
[8282.10s -> 8289.57s]  God damn it.
[8292.13s -> 8295.27s]  Oh, no, no, no, please.
[8296.23s -> 8299.52s]  I played up a hundred bats in assault
[8299.52s -> 8300.40s]  is essentially just like,
[8300.40s -> 8301.68s]  please kill me for free.
[8302.24s -> 8315.40s]  You finish your homework?
[8315.40s -> 8316.28s]  I don't do homework.
[8316.92s -> 8319.08s]  I never hand in homework not one time
[8319.08s -> 8320.20s]  and I get an A on every test
[8320.20s -> 8320.76s]  so I get a C.
[8343.04s -> 8343.92s]  I did the same.
[8344.48s -> 8350.18s]  No, I did homework.
[8350.74s -> 8355.65s]  Fairly decent amount of the time.
[8355.65s -> 8357.09s]  I do think we actually can go in though.
[8358.02s -> 8358.98s]  Yeah, we absolutely can.
[8359.70s -> 8362.84s]  I'm jumping in and just throwing it.
[8362.84s -> 8363.32s]  I don't even care.
[8376.45s -> 8377.97s]  No, no, fuck.
[8377.97s -> 8378.77s]  I saw it happen.
[8379.73s -> 8383.64s]  No, I thought I was in the clear.
[8383.64s -> 8384.76s]  I see this guy in the sky.
[8385.72s -> 8390.79s]  I walked right into it too.
[8390.79s -> 8391.43s]  God damn it.
[8391.43s -> 8392.63s]  I have one in five.
[8392.63s -> 8393.91s]  I can't be this shitty one.
[8394.55s -> 8396.37s]  Use your three to teleport.
[8407.19s -> 8407.83s]  What?
[8407.83s -> 8412.39s]  That's actually okay.
[8412.39s -> 8413.51s]  That's really helpful.
[8413.51s -> 8415.72s]  That's very helpful.
[8415.72s -> 8416.60s]  Who's doing all the damage?
[8417.16s -> 8418.96s]  It's all physical.
[8418.96s -> 8424.24s]  This is good damage.
[8424.24s -> 8427.41s]  Whatever movement speed.
[8427.41s -> 8427.89s]  I want that.
[8435.33s -> 8438.76s]  I put my headphones down
[8438.76s -> 8439.80s]  to focus on a math problem.
[8439.80s -> 8441.56s]  That's in that sound you made.
[8441.56s -> 8443.24s]  I could hear it across my whole desk.
[8443.24s -> 8452.21s]  Careful.
[8453.17s -> 8453.73s]  Oh, shit.
[8455.36s -> 8456.40s]  But no.
[8456.40s -> 8457.76s]  What the fuck, dude?
[8457.76s -> 8458.40s]  Why?
[8458.40s -> 8458.64s]  No.
[8462.26s -> 8464.56s]  That was bad.
[8464.56s -> 8465.20s]  God damn it.
[8465.92s -> 8472.29s]  All right.
[8472.29s -> 8472.93s]  No more talking.
[8472.93s -> 8473.97s]  I'm paying attention.
[8473.97s -> 8489.81s]  This is bad.
[8492.45s -> 8494.24s]  Get off me.
[8494.24s -> 8494.56s]  Get off.
[8513.30s -> 8513.70s]  Nice.
[8513.70s -> 8514.42s]  Good work.
[8514.42s -> 8524.85s]  Oh, he's in the air.
[8524.85s -> 8528.71s]  What else?
[8528.71s -> 8529.51s]  Get the tower.
[8529.51s -> 8536.84s]  Oh, are you serious?
[8536.84s -> 8537.80s]  What a fucking god.
[8538.44s -> 8542.32s]  No more swearing.
[8542.32s -> 8543.76s]  I'm not going to say the fuck anymore.
[8544.32s -> 8554.21s]  All right.
[8554.21s -> 8555.41s]  That was a good team fight.
[8555.41s -> 8561.03s]  Oops.
[8561.03s -> 8562.55s]  I thought I didn't teleport.
[8562.55s -> 8563.35s]  I thought I teleported.
[8579.27s -> 8588.64s]  What was the one I wanted to get?
[8589.20s -> 8590.16s]  This one.
[8594.53s -> 8595.81s]  I hate it when you play video games.
[8595.81s -> 8597.89s]  You just have an entire room full of fidget toys
[8597.89s -> 8607.89s]  that he uses on face cam.
[8607.89s -> 8609.01s]  Do you want to watch a cat?
[8609.73s -> 8611.54s]  I think there are plenty of streams
[8611.54s -> 8612.66s]  where it's just a cat in a room
[8612.66s -> 8613.70s]  with a bunch of cat toys.
[8615.59s -> 8616.79s]  Believe those already exist.
[8617.35s -> 8631.80s]  They're at the Phoenix?
[8647.70s -> 8649.76s]  Oh, my god.
[8649.76s -> 8650.88s]  The Thanatos is going to kill me
[8650.88s -> 8652.40s]  and I'm freaking out about it.
[8652.40s -> 8653.28s]  Oh, my god.
[8654.24s -> 8655.86s]  Oh, they wasted their ult.
[8655.86s -> 8664.90s]  I wish that indicator was smaller.
[8664.90s -> 8666.34s]  It takes up like your whole character
[8666.34s -> 8668.02s]  and it's like just making you panic.
[8676.18s -> 8677.06s]  I'm playing Hunbats.
[8677.06s -> 8677.78s]  This character sucks.
[8677.78s -> 8678.74s]  It's like literally F tier.
[8680.48s -> 8681.84s]  I think on every Smite tier list
[8681.84s -> 8683.20s]  this character is actually at the bottom.
[8684.40s -> 8685.04s]  It's never picked.
[8685.76s -> 8697.64s]  Yeah, I looked up Smite tier list before this
[8697.64s -> 8698.60s]  and it was like Hunbats,
[8699.48s -> 8700.28s]  they didn't put him on the list.
[8700.28s -> 8701.00s]  They didn't even place him.
[8701.64s -> 8706.02s]  He's only been played in one game in competitive
[8706.02s -> 8707.14s]  is because they banned everybody.
[8707.14s -> 8708.18s]  They banned all the characters
[8708.18s -> 8710.90s]  that their hunter was really good at.
[8724.90s -> 8725.54s]  Their hunter?
[8725.54s -> 8726.42s]  Whatever, assassin.
[8729.73s -> 8730.77s]  Oh, I'm the only one alive.
[8742.32s -> 8745.28s]  Oh, they think they're going to fuck around.
[8745.28s -> 8747.33s]  My god, run.
[8748.56s -> 8750.16s]  My god, this person's terrifying.
[8750.16s -> 8750.72s]  Oh, my god.
[8750.72s -> 8751.92s]  He's getting closer.
[8751.92s -> 8752.96s]  I hate Thanatos.
[8752.96s -> 8753.76s]  He's terrifying.
[8759.30s -> 8760.18s]  Damn it.
[8760.18s -> 8761.46s]  Get away from me.
[8762.02s -> 8777.67s]  What are you doing?
[8787.57s -> 8788.05s]  Where is he?
[8788.61s -> 8789.09s]  Where are you?
[8791.91s -> 8794.71s]  I successfully defended the fortress.
[8801.65s -> 8814.77s]  This is it.
[8814.77s -> 8815.73s]  This is where we win.
[8815.73s -> 8817.40s]  You're playing smart.
[8828.64s -> 8835.04s]  Just kill the Titan.
[8835.04s -> 8835.92s]  Who cares about anything else?
[8836.72s -> 8838.79s]  Kill the Titan.
[8839.97s -> 8840.85s]  Oh, thank god.
[8840.85s -> 8841.33s]  Nice work.
[8845.48s -> 8846.60s]  Hunbats is actually pretty fun.
[8847.24s -> 8848.60s]  I'd put him on C tier.
[8849.86s -> 8851.70s]  I've seen some tier lists that put him pretty low
[8851.70s -> 8852.58s]  and that's not fair.
[8852.58s -> 8853.46s]  He has a really good kit.
[8854.02s -> 8865.30s]  I really like this person's stream.
[8865.86s -> 8866.66s]  Very friendly.
[8866.66s -> 8867.94s]  They gave me the buff like three times.
[8873.49s -> 8874.61s]  I'm going to take a pee break
[8874.61s -> 8876.13s]  and get some water, maybe a coffee.
[8876.13s -> 8877.83s]  I'll come back and we'll do a little bit more.
[8878.47s -> 9144.07s]  I will be right back.
[9144.07s -> 9147.75s]  When did Cash App give 69 subs?
[9147.75s -> 9154.42s]  When did that happen?
[9154.42s -> 9156.90s]  I missed that completely.
[9156.90s -> 9159.33s]  Oh, it was like 20 minutes ago.
[9159.33s -> 9160.29s]  It was like an hour ago.
[9160.29s -> 9160.93s]  What?
[9160.93s -> 9166.72s]  Was I just locked into gamer mode?
[9166.72s -> 9167.68s]  Oh, okay.
[9168.88s -> 9171.92s]  Well, thank you Cash App for the 69 community subs.
[9171.92s -> 9174.05s]  That's a lot.
[9176.96s -> 9181.28s]  Thank you Zap X for the 10 community subs.
[9181.28s -> 9185.41s]  And Loxbury, thanks for five community subs.
[9185.41s -> 9189.44s]  Thank you, thank you.
[9189.44s -> 9190.96s]  I'm always in gamer mode.
[9190.96s -> 9191.44s]  I'm not.
[9191.44s -> 9193.44s]  I'm in gamer mode for like five minutes a week.
[9193.44s -> 9203.24s]  Let me go here.
[9206.29s -> 9206.93s]  All right, let's do...
[9211.16s -> 9212.28s]  I got some skins.
[9212.28s -> 9212.60s]  I did.
[9213.24s -> 9217.19s]  Because I had to buy the god pack on this account.
[9218.20s -> 9219.80s]  I got the god pack and then I got some gems
[9219.80s -> 9221.24s]  just to play around with and I already...
[9221.24s -> 9224.12s]  I think I like freaked out and I bought like four boxes.
[9224.12s -> 9226.00s]  I don't even know what I own.
[9226.00s -> 9228.32s]  Is there a way to see what I actually own?
[9229.04s -> 9238.93s]  Can I see the gods that I actually have skins with or no?
[9238.93s -> 9239.97s]  Sort by purchased.
[9240.77s -> 9244.39s]  Purchased, purchased?
[9246.20s -> 9247.08s]  No, sadly.
[9247.08s -> 9247.56s]  Oh, okay.
[9248.76s -> 9250.52s]  I got a skin for somebody besides Anubis.
[9250.52s -> 9251.00s]  Who was it?
[9251.64s -> 9255.48s]  I feel like it was Achilles or something.
[9255.48s -> 9255.88s]  Let's see.
[9256.44s -> 9257.40s]  Yeah, what's this one?
[9261.11s -> 9261.67s]  That's all right.
[9262.23s -> 9264.32s]  Can we go through and look at the skins?
[9264.32s -> 9266.32s]  Is that boring content for you guys?
[9266.32s -> 9269.27s]  How boring is that?
[9269.27s -> 9270.23s]  At a scale of one to ten.
[9270.79s -> 9282.05s]  All right, that's fine.
[9282.05s -> 9283.67s]  Who's this?
[9284.39s -> 9285.40s]  Charibdis?
[9287.36s -> 9288.08s]  Charibdis.
[9289.70s -> 9291.06s]  Charibdis?
[9291.06s -> 9291.70s]  How do I say this?
[9292.63s -> 9293.27s]  Charibdis?
[9293.99s -> 9302.60s]  Who is this?
[9304.12s -> 9307.03s]  Charribdis.
[9307.75s -> 9310.55s]  All right, what do you got for skins?
[9311.11s -> 9317.76s]  Ah, it's just blue.
[9317.76s -> 9318.72s]  That's cool.
[9318.72s -> 9319.38s]  What is this one?
[9319.38s -> 9320.10s]  This one's limited.
[9320.74s -> 9329.73s]  This item will never be available through special promotions or events ever again.
[9329.73s -> 9332.60s]  Oh, okay.
[9336.40s -> 9337.92s]  Who's a god that I like to play?
[9342.39s -> 9344.15s]  Not even subtle about the FOMO.
[9345.35s -> 9347.06s]  Oh, here it is.
[9347.06s -> 9347.54s]  Okay, here.
[9348.10s -> 9352.76s]  It's just Aang.
[9353.32s -> 9356.16s]  He's dead.
[9356.16s -> 9362.44s]  I kind of want this.
[9362.44s -> 9368.29s]  This one's 3,500 gems.
[9369.35s -> 9370.15s]  What is that?
[9370.15s -> 9372.15s]  Is that like a $50 skin?
[9372.15s -> 9373.19s]  How expensive is that?
[9389.20s -> 9390.72s]  Okay.
[9394.71s -> 9395.51s]  Is this the same actor?
[9395.51s -> 9396.15s]  No, it can't be.
[9398.15s -> 9398.87s]  It's a middle lane.
[9403.67s -> 9412.50s]  That's really nice and great and dandy, but what does it actually sound like in-game?
[9412.50s -> 9414.50s]  And then they don't do it again and they just play the game.
[9418.00s -> 9426.79s]  Whoa, Ghost Rider.
[9426.79s -> 9428.47s]  This is the one that I like.
[9428.47s -> 9430.15s]  This is the Merlin I want to see.
[9431.33s -> 9432.77s]  Yep, that's the one.
[9432.77s -> 9437.33s]  They got a lot of Merlin skins.
[9448.08s -> 9449.36s]  It's the jewel wizard.
[9450.85s -> 9455.81s]  Yeah, it kind of is.
[9455.81s -> 9457.43s]  Cool.
[9457.43s -> 9460.15s]  I tried to play King Arthur in a training match,
[9460.63s -> 9462.74s]  but the moveset was so weird to me.
[9462.74s -> 9463.70s]  I just couldn't even.
[9463.70s -> 9464.74s]  I just exited.
[9464.74s -> 9465.89s]  Where is he?
[9465.89s -> 9470.60s]  Where's Arthur?
[9470.60s -> 9475.03s]  Is it King Arthur and not Arthur?
[9475.59s -> 9479.32s]  King Arthur.
[9479.32s -> 9485.40s]  King Arthur is just Arthas.
[9490.80s -> 9493.84s]  Didn't they base everything on the Arthurian shit anyways?
[9493.84s -> 9502.69s]  All the way around?
[9503.89s -> 9506.13s]  There was an Uther before Uther in Warcraft.
[9508.31s -> 9509.83s]  Just to let you know.
[9509.83s -> 9513.64s]  Okay, we got a dragon one.
[9513.64s -> 9518.34s]  That's kind of cool.
[9518.34s -> 9519.70s]  Look at Cthulhu's skin.
[9519.70s -> 9520.66s]  Oh, that's what we're going to do.
[9521.46s -> 9525.99s]  I've got a pretty good bugleberry skin.
[9527.35s -> 9533.60s]  It's young Arthur.
[9534.24s -> 9540.58s]  Cthulhu has a cuphead skin.
[9541.60s -> 9543.20s]  You're losing viewers.
[9543.20s -> 9544.37s]  That's okay.
[9546.53s -> 9547.97s]  Why is that surprise anybody?
[9547.97s -> 9553.32s]  I'm in a menu looking at skins.
[9553.32s -> 9554.44s]  Actually, I like this one.
[9562.92s -> 9564.42s]  All right, Cthulhu.
[9564.42s -> 9565.30s]  Let's see.
[9565.30s -> 9570.77s]  What do you got?
[9570.77s -> 9571.65s]  This one's exclusive.
[9574.07s -> 9574.47s]  Purple.
[9574.47s -> 9577.91s]  His purple skin is only available for a limited time only.
[9577.91s -> 9580.96s]  What's the difference?
[9580.96s -> 9589.75s]  Oh, he's purple.
[9589.75s -> 9590.47s]  That one's cool.
[9592.26s -> 9592.90s]  Yeah, okay.
[9592.90s -> 9593.78s]  I could see that.
[9593.78s -> 9595.22s]  That one would be fun to have.
[9595.22s -> 9597.92s]  What is this, like, America one?
[9604.50s -> 9606.08s]  Okay, cool.
[9615.36s -> 9617.28s]  Okay, this is one of those cases where
[9617.28s -> 9619.84s]  I would play against this person
[9619.84s -> 9622.77s]  and I would not know this was Cthulhu.
[9622.77s -> 9623.97s]  It would fuck with me.
[9630.04s -> 9631.80s]  This changes the whole character to a point
[9631.80s -> 9633.00s]  where this is a different character.
[9639.27s -> 9640.79s]  This item can be earned through an event
[9640.79s -> 9643.91s]  or purchase for its full price once the event has ended.
[9651.46s -> 9653.94s]  Why is this just the single player in Mortal Kombat?
[9653.94s -> 9654.88s]  What do I have to do?
[9656.63s -> 9657.43s]  Buy all.
[9657.99s -> 9661.73s]  I need 160,000 Odyssey points.
[9666.76s -> 9667.80s]  More points.
[9667.80s -> 9669.00s]  Quest map.
[9669.00s -> 9670.76s]  This is the shit I was talking about.
[9670.76s -> 9673.70s]  This is exactly what I was talking about.
[9673.70s -> 9676.80s]  Visit territory.
[9676.80s -> 9680.10s]  Okay, what does this have to do with the video game Smite?
[9680.10s -> 9680.90s]  What is this?
[9680.90s -> 9684.88s]  Complete all the quests.
[9684.88s -> 9685.84s]  Oh, okay.
[9685.84s -> 9688.16s]  Play an assassin in two games and you get this.
[9688.16s -> 9689.44s]  This is too much for my brain.
[9689.44s -> 9693.33s]  It's just a battle pass.
[9693.33s -> 9694.74s]  Okay, right.
[9694.74s -> 9695.14s]  Rules.
[9697.48s -> 9699.24s]  Is the end user license agreement?
[9700.64s -> 9701.04s]  Lore.
[9703.00s -> 9703.88s]  Bundles.
[9703.88s -> 9708.04s]  I already bought a bunch of these.
[9708.04s -> 9711.22s]  All right, well, that's cool.
[9711.22s -> 9712.98s]  There's one that I want you to look at as well
[9712.98s -> 9716.58s]  that is also kind of game breaking and bizarre is this one.
[9716.58s -> 9725.49s]  It's just so weird.
[9726.05s -> 9731.89s]  I like this one.
[9731.89s -> 9737.32s]  That's terrifying.
[9737.32s -> 9739.43s]  And look at this.
[9740.07s -> 9743.68s]  It's just a bunch of cartoon characters.
[9744.32s -> 9759.92s]  What is this?
[9759.92s -> 9763.16s]  I'm not going to buy this stuff.
[9763.16s -> 9764.44s]  I'm not going to play this game.
[9764.44s -> 9765.80s]  What the fuck?
[9765.80s -> 9768.52s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[9768.52s -> 9769.08s]  What does it say?
[9771.56s -> 9775.88s]  What's this supposed to be?
[9776.84s -> 9780.77s]  Check out the Doge skin.
[9780.77s -> 9786.50s]  Is it arterio?
[9791.30s -> 9793.60s]  Doge is a Doge skin.
[9793.60s -> 9796.10s]  Where?
[9796.10s -> 9796.90s]  Wrong one.
[9796.90s -> 9797.38s]  Scatty.
[9797.94s -> 9825.16s]  Let's give them the benefit of the doubt here.
[9825.72s -> 9828.04s]  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.
[9828.04s -> 9829.96s]  All right.
[9829.96s -> 9834.79s]  Did this come out this past like six, seven months?
[9834.79s -> 9839.49s]  Or has this been a thing for the last couple of years?
[9839.49s -> 9840.61s]  Five years ago?
[9840.61s -> 9844.39s]  This gets a pass.
[9851.27s -> 9852.15s]  Four or five years ago.
[9852.15s -> 9854.26s]  Okay.
[9854.26s -> 9855.06s]  Very old skin.
[9855.06s -> 9855.86s]  Yeah, okay.
[9855.86s -> 9860.13s]  But they're not just jumping on this.
[9860.13s -> 9860.77s]  Okay.
[9860.77s -> 9866.25s]  What's this?
[9867.12s -> 9867.62s]  Korra?
[9873.67s -> 9874.17s]  Whoa.
[9878.77s -> 9880.53s]  What other cartoon characters are in this?
[9880.53s -> 9882.56s]  Besides Ninja Turtles.
[9882.56s -> 9883.52s]  And who is Splinter?
[9883.52s -> 9884.48s]  I know he's in the game.
[9884.48s -> 9885.04s]  And Shredder.
[9893.60s -> 9895.52s]  Is Stranger Things?
[9895.52s -> 9896.72s]  Rick and Morty are not in this.
[9896.72s -> 9901.52s]  Please, I will buy them right now.
[9901.52s -> 9904.56s]  If Rick and Morty are in the game, I'm going to buy Rick and Morty.
[9904.56s -> 9907.49s]  I'm going to play the rest of the stream as Rick and Morty.
[9907.49s -> 9908.61s]  Is that actually in the game?
[9908.61s -> 9909.33s]  I hate that.
[9909.33s -> 9909.83s]  I want it.
[9915.59s -> 9916.79s]  There's a Pickle Rick skin.
[9917.51s -> 9922.68s]  All right.
[9922.68s -> 9923.48s]  Where are they?
[9923.48s -> 9931.73s]  Who's Shredder?
[9931.73s -> 9934.05s]  If you play as Rick and Morty, this will be the worst stream.
[9934.05s -> 9937.22s]  I could agree with that.
[9937.22s -> 9937.94s]  Bear Insomniac?
[9937.94s -> 9941.08s]  Okay.
[9941.08s -> 9941.96s]  Bear Insomniac.
[9945.70s -> 9951.78s]  Whoa.
[9951.78s -> 9952.42s]  Where?
[9952.42s -> 9961.46s]  Holy shit.
[9962.90s -> 9963.78s]  How much is this?
[9967.57s -> 9971.01s]  89,000 gems is how much money?
[9971.01s -> 9972.37s]  That's like a hundred bucks.
[9975.44s -> 9976.08s]  Why?
[9976.08s -> 9976.96s]  That's a...
[9976.96s -> 9977.60s]  What is this?
[9980.34s -> 9981.06s]  Oh, okay.
[9981.62s -> 9982.58s]  This is where they get you.
[9983.46s -> 9985.54s]  This item can be earned through an event.
[9986.61s -> 9988.45s]  Or purchased for its full price.
[9988.45s -> 9990.37s]  So I guess there's another way to earn this.
[9990.37s -> 9992.69s]  This is just if you don't want to go through all the trouble or something.
[9992.69s -> 9992.93s]  I don't know.
[9992.93s -> 9993.97s]  That's a lot of money.
[9993.97s -> 9999.54s]  This one looks cool.
[10004.79s -> 10005.67s]  I love the snapping.
[10005.67s -> 10016.20s]  I got to play as Baron Sammy.
[10016.20s -> 10016.44s]  Yeah.
[10016.44s -> 10018.64s]  This is the new main.
[10018.64s -> 10019.44s]  Baron's really fun.
[10020.00s -> 10021.40s]  I'm going to try him.
[10021.40s -> 10024.40s]  I want to find all the...
[10024.40s -> 10025.76s]  I know the Ninja Turtles.
[10025.76s -> 10027.57s]  But a Thanatos?
[10028.13s -> 10031.75s]  Yeah.
[10031.75s -> 10034.39s]  I remember Thanatos having a ton of skins even back when I played.
[10052.07s -> 10052.57s]  All right.
[10061.48s -> 10062.28s]  What the fuck?
[10069.19s -> 10071.44s]  That's just...
[10072.16s -> 10074.58s]  It's just Cupid.
[10077.28s -> 10077.60s]  This one...
[10077.60s -> 10078.72s]  That one transforms.
[10078.72s -> 10079.20s]  Which one?
[10080.08s -> 10080.72s]  This one does?
[10081.36s -> 10089.68s]  Go to Archon.
[10089.68s -> 10094.56s]  Who's Ar-Ar-Archon?
[10094.56s -> 10095.20s]  Arrocon?
[10095.84s -> 10106.13s]  Archon is the skin.
[10106.13s -> 10106.69s]  Oh.
[10106.69s -> 10107.81s]  Archon Thanatos?
[10113.38s -> 10113.78s]  Reaper.
[10115.27s -> 10115.91s]  Obey.
[10115.91s -> 10117.11s]  Where's Archon?
[10117.11s -> 10118.13s]  Grim Reaper.
[10118.69s -> 10119.09s]  Cyber.
[10123.99s -> 10124.87s]  Classic.
[10124.87s -> 10125.83s]  Ruby Rose.
[10130.84s -> 10132.20s]  Ruby Rose?
[10132.20s -> 10144.60s]  Oh, it's from an anime.
[10144.60s -> 10144.84s]  Okay.
[10150.23s -> 10150.63s]  Where's...
[10150.63s -> 10151.43s]  There's too many skins.
[10151.43s -> 10152.23s]  Where's Archon?
[10153.35s -> 10153.91s]  Demonic.
[10154.71s -> 10155.11s]  Golden.
[10155.67s -> 10156.71s]  There's no Archon.
[10158.12s -> 10159.48s]  Soul Harvester.
[10159.48s -> 10159.88s]  Reaper.
[10160.80s -> 10161.60s]  Final Boss.
[10162.61s -> 10163.49s]  Jack the Reaper.
[10164.23s -> 10164.71s]  Obey.
[10165.35s -> 10167.30s]  Grim Reaper.
[10167.30s -> 10167.62s]  Sci...
[10167.62s -> 10168.66s]  Where is this?
[10168.66s -> 10175.01s]  Ruby Rose.
[10175.57s -> 10176.77s]  Classic Ruby Rose.
[10176.77s -> 10177.49s]  There's a classic.
[10178.21s -> 10179.78s]  I skipped the only good one.
[10188.36s -> 10189.56s]  Where's Archon?
[10190.20s -> 10192.93s]  Are you guys lying?
[10192.93s -> 10193.17s]  Oh.
[10199.30s -> 10200.24s]  Okay.
[10200.24s -> 10200.72s]  What does it do?
[10202.79s -> 10204.53s]  Oh.
[10204.53s -> 10205.97s]  Level 1 minion.
[10205.97s -> 10207.01s]  Level 15 boss.
[10207.81s -> 10209.17s]  Level 30 boss.
[10209.17s -> 10221.54s]  That's cool.
[10222.10s -> 10224.07s]  All right.
[10224.07s -> 10224.87s]  I want to see if one...
[10226.37s -> 10226.61s]  Where...
[10230.90s -> 10231.86s]  Who's the guy that goes,
[10231.86s -> 10232.58s]  Stick around.
[10236.82s -> 10238.58s]  Stick around.
[10238.58s -> 10240.92s]  And who's the guy that goes,
[10242.60s -> 10243.08s]  Buttery.
[10243.72s -> 10244.44s]  Crispy.
[10244.44s -> 10245.24s]  Crust.
[10245.24s -> 10246.90s]  Flaky.
[10249.38s -> 10251.32s]  Crispy.
[10251.32s -> 10251.96s]  Buttery.
[10251.96s -> 10252.44s]  Flaky.
[10252.92s -> 10253.16s]  Buttery.
[10253.16s -> 10253.56s]  Crispy.
[10253.56s -> 10254.28s]  Crust.
[10254.28s -> 10258.21s]  Is Mario?
[10258.21s -> 10259.09s]  No, it's not.
[10259.09s -> 10269.32s]  It's not Peter Griffin.
[10269.32s -> 10270.28s]  If you don't know that video,
[10270.28s -> 10271.40s]  then holy shit.
[10271.40s -> 10271.88s]  Come on.
[10272.60s -> 10274.29s]  Have you ever used the internet?
[10274.29s -> 10276.05s]  Guys, I'm the one that's not supposed to be...
[10276.05s -> 10277.81s]  I don't know about the memes and shit.
[10277.81s -> 10278.37s]  You...
[10278.37s -> 10280.64s]  Come on.
[10280.64s -> 10284.32s]  Sylvanas there.
[10285.06s -> 10285.46s]  Yeah.
[10285.46s -> 10286.26s]  He goes,
[10286.26s -> 10286.90s]  Sylvanas!
[10296.37s -> 10297.09s]  Bob Ross.
[10305.19s -> 10305.88s]  Okay.
[10306.44s -> 10308.63s]  What's this?
[10309.35s -> 10314.32s]  They got a spoiled Stranger Things.
[10315.36s -> 10317.97s]  This is a...
[10317.97s -> 10319.49s]  I think I just spoiled the show.
[10319.49s -> 10320.37s]  I've never seen it.
[10320.37s -> 10331.75s]  What did you want me to see here?
[10339.97s -> 10342.34s]  Okay.
[10342.34s -> 10343.22s]  Now I want to see Splinter,
[10343.22s -> 10343.94s]  and I want to see Shredder,
[10343.94s -> 10345.14s]  and then we can keep playing.
[10345.14s -> 10346.20s]  Hachiman.
[10346.20s -> 10346.84s]  Okay.
[10346.84s -> 10350.56s]  Hachiman.
[10351.92s -> 10353.60s]  Where is Hachiman's skin?
[10354.24s -> 10354.72s]  What is this?
[10359.54s -> 10363.96s]  It's a really good furry OC.
[10364.60s -> 10367.96s]  Okay.
[10368.52s -> 10369.00s]  Oh yeah.
[10373.73s -> 10374.61s]  There he is.
[10374.61s -> 10375.33s]  Master Splinter.
[10380.23s -> 10386.74s]  I want this.
[10387.38s -> 10389.80s]  Would you guys judge me if I bought this?
[10389.80s -> 10393.32s]  How much would I get judged?
[10396.23s -> 10398.58s]  What does that actually translate to for money?
[10398.58s -> 10402.63s]  No.
[10402.63s -> 10403.75s]  We already judged you already.
[10403.75s -> 10403.91s]  All right.
[10403.91s -> 10405.03s]  So that's Hachiman.
[10405.03s -> 10406.07s]  Where's Shredder?
[10406.07s -> 10412.40s]  Buy it on your main account.
[10412.40s -> 10414.47s]  That's also pretty true.
[10414.47s -> 10418.07s]  Ravana.
[10418.07s -> 10419.83s]  Yeah.
[10419.83s -> 10421.19s]  I really shouldn't buy anything on this account
[10421.19s -> 10422.55s]  besides the god pack.
[10422.55s -> 10435.97s]  All right.
[10435.97s -> 10436.45s]  There it is.
[10440.79s -> 10441.68s]  That's pretty cool.
[10444.44s -> 10445.40s]  Completed.
[10447.32s -> 10448.44s]  I was just going to say something,
[10448.44s -> 10449.96s]  and then I realized that I could just play
[10449.96s -> 10451.56s]  the Nickelodeon All-Stars game,
[10451.56s -> 10452.52s]  because I was about to say,
[10452.52s -> 10453.88s]  imagine a game like this,
[10453.88s -> 10456.44s]  but it's just like old cartoon characters,
[10456.44s -> 10457.88s]  and like Nickelodeon characters,
[10457.88s -> 10459.32s]  and like Disney characters.
[10459.32s -> 10462.52s]  Krang is in the game too.
[10462.52s -> 10467.92s]  There are enough old cartoons and old stuff
[10467.92s -> 10469.28s]  to be able to make a smite,
[10469.28s -> 10470.16s]  but instead of gods,
[10470.16s -> 10471.36s]  it's just old characters.
[10471.36s -> 10477.20s]  Let's see.
[10477.20s -> 10481.40s]  Is Krang in the game?
[10483.36s -> 10484.32s]  Oh my god.
[10484.32s -> 10485.44s]  It's actually in the game.
[10489.62s -> 10490.74s]  I have to buy this.
[10491.97s -> 10492.29s]  What?
[10494.37s -> 10497.56s]  You're going to make Krang
[10497.56s -> 10499.24s]  an exclusive special promotion?
[10512.15s -> 10513.99s]  Krang is Twitch Prime giveaway.
[10516.07s -> 10516.31s]  Oh.
[10516.87s -> 10518.63s]  Krang is free with Twitch Prime.
[10518.63s -> 10520.23s]  I don't want to link my Twitch Prime to this.
[10521.96s -> 10522.60s]  Not this one.
[10525.70s -> 10526.02s]  All right.
[10526.02s -> 10526.66s]  Cool.
[10526.66s -> 10527.62s]  Super cool.
[10527.62s -> 10529.00s]  What about Nuwa?
[10532.39s -> 10537.97s]  Where's Nuwa?
[10537.97s -> 10539.17s]  Nuwa.
[10539.17s -> 10540.39s]  Nuwa.
[10540.39s -> 10542.21s]  Okay.
[10551.04s -> 10552.31s]  This is a League character.
[10553.03s -> 10560.53s]  Is there a Ninja Turtles character?
[10560.53s -> 10562.29s]  Or a Nickelodeon character?
[10562.29s -> 10567.41s]  Okay.
[10567.41s -> 10568.29s]  Well, that was...
[10571.06s -> 10574.20s]  This one's $3,600.
[10575.88s -> 10585.70s]  All right.
[10585.70s -> 10590.04s]  Well, what about Jeb?
[10593.22s -> 10595.06s]  What does Jeb have for skins?
[10595.06s -> 10596.74s]  Oh, Frosty the Snowman.
[10596.74s -> 10599.51s]  This is my favorite skin in the game.
[10600.79s -> 10601.35s]  $1,200?
[10607.91s -> 10609.51s]  Yeah, I think I have to get a Jeb.
[10611.27s -> 10613.32s]  What about this one?
[10617.12s -> 10617.68s]  Interesting.
[10619.14s -> 10619.78s]  What is that?
[10625.20s -> 10626.24s]  Jeb is cool.
[10628.87s -> 10629.99s]  The earth moves.
[10629.99s -> 10630.95s]  I'm playing Jeb next game.
[10635.09s -> 10635.97s]  Excuse me, Jeb.
[10635.97s -> 10637.25s]  We're going to play as Jeb.
[10637.25s -> 10638.48s]  All right.
[10638.48s -> 10639.52s]  We're going to do Arena.
[10640.34s -> 10652.20s]  Get ready for Arena.
[10652.20s -> 10652.68s]  Arena.
[10655.08s -> 10656.52s]  Blind pick is what we want, right?
[10656.52s -> 10659.62s]  Diving level three?
[10661.24s -> 10662.12s]  Pause type none.
[10664.92s -> 10667.56s]  Jeb sucks in Arena.
[10667.56s -> 10668.04s]  That's true.
[10668.04s -> 10668.44s]  Never mind.
[10670.32s -> 10670.72s]  All right.
[10670.72s -> 10671.44s]  I'm going to make...
[10671.44s -> 10671.84s]  You know what?
[10671.84s -> 10672.56s]  Let's really go for this.
[10672.56s -> 10674.16s]  I'm going to make this password very hard.
[10674.16s -> 10675.68s]  Let's see if anybody can get this.
[10675.68s -> 10680.74s]  I bet that somebody would be able to get.
[10682.52s -> 10683.24s]  I don't know.
[10683.24s -> 10683.64s]  I wonder.
[10684.28s -> 10693.99s]  What would I do?
[10694.87s -> 10695.91s]  Something very hard.
[10696.63s -> 10709.24s]  Okay.
[10709.24s -> 10710.20s]  If somebody gets this,
[10710.20s -> 10714.44s]  that's really weird that we're on the same kind of plane of existence, right?
[10714.44s -> 10717.86s]  Looks good.
[10718.42s -> 10728.18s]  It swallowed really weirdly and it hurt.
[10731.03s -> 10732.07s]  Will somebody get this?
[10736.52s -> 10737.32s]  If somebody gets this,
[10737.32s -> 10738.52s]  if more than one or two people get this,
[10738.52s -> 10753.56s]  this is just proof to make sure you have a good password.
[10753.56s -> 10754.04s]  A hint?
[10754.68s -> 10755.24s]  Okay.
[10757.04s -> 10758.08s]  It is food related.
[10758.72s -> 10762.07s]  This is a food related item
[10763.78s -> 10765.30s]  and it can sit in your pantry.
[10765.86s -> 10767.52s]  Does not need to be refrigerated.
[10768.16s -> 10772.93s]  You would classify this as a snack.
[10781.36s -> 10784.72s]  And the main ingredient in this comes from a cow.
[10784.72s -> 10800.52s]  By the way, I spelled it wrong.
[10800.52s -> 10802.12s]  Now that we're thinking and we're doing this.
[10807.40s -> 10822.80s]  The password is Cheez-It with no spaces, no capitals.
[10822.80s -> 10824.24s]  And it's not the brand name.
[10824.24s -> 10830.04s]  It's Cheez-It.
[10830.04s -> 10830.84s]  Whoops.
[10830.84s -> 10841.78s]  Have you seen Gas Station Simulator?
[10843.54s -> 10844.10s]  I have.
[10844.10s -> 10845.32s]  I was thinking about it.
[10847.81s -> 10848.66s]  All right.
[10848.66s -> 10849.30s]  What is it?
[10849.30s -> 10850.42s]  What does it move?
[10850.42s -> 10859.35s]  That was cool.
[10859.35s -> 10859.67s]  All right.
[10863.03s -> 10864.21s]  This is a arena.
[10864.21s -> 10864.61s]  Probably good.
[10864.61s -> 10865.01s]  He's a mage.
[10865.41s -> 10867.38s]  What about Jeb?
[10867.94s -> 10869.22s]  Jeb is very bad.
[10869.22s -> 10870.42s]  You have the Jeb skin.
[10870.90s -> 10873.52s]  Oh, you guys have the cool skins.
[10873.52s -> 10874.40s]  You have the frog skin.
[10874.96s -> 10883.20s]  Click the icon on the left to see moves.
[10883.76s -> 10886.71s]  Oh, here we go.
[10886.71s -> 10889.22s]  All right.
[10889.22s -> 10892.34s]  Baron shares Baron's Brew, a powerful restorative chalice
[10892.34s -> 10893.78s]  with his allies from the item shop.
[10894.34s -> 10897.60s]  Enemies hit by Baron will have hysteria applied to them.
[10898.16s -> 10899.70s]  Baron's abilities interact with hysteria
[10899.70s -> 10902.50s]  to provide bonus effects, targets, and max hysteria
[10902.50s -> 10907.28s]  from the item shop?
[10907.28s -> 10911.20s]  Okay.
[10911.20s -> 10912.88s]  So you have to hit people to get hysteria.
[10913.52s -> 10917.25s]  I've seen this before.
[10917.25s -> 10919.01s]  You put the mirror down and it's just me.
[10919.65s -> 10925.24s]  This one is god.
[10925.24s -> 10925.80s]  Okay.
[10925.80s -> 10926.36s]  Whatever.
[10926.36s -> 10927.40s]  I'll figure it out.
[10927.40s -> 10932.37s]  Well, this is kind of like the Anubis wrap.
[10932.93s -> 10941.88s]  Baron's Brew is a multi-potion that you can only get on him.
[10941.88s -> 10942.36s]  Oh, okay.
[10945.57s -> 10947.49s]  Add me on Cookie Run Kingdom.
[10947.49s -> 10960.92s]  I sounded kind of rude, but I don't play it.
[10967.24s -> 10969.19s]  All right.
[10969.19s -> 10969.67s]  So let me see.
[10970.39s -> 10973.11s]  So that's kind of like a little grab like Anubis.
[10973.11s -> 10973.59s]  What's this one?
[10975.57s -> 10977.73s]  That's this is what I like.
[10977.73s -> 10978.05s]  This thing.
[10978.05s -> 10979.41s]  You go boom, bam, the two beams.
[10980.29s -> 10980.53s]  All right.
[10980.53s -> 10982.93s]  So just a hit with abilities and then it does more damage.
[10983.75s -> 10984.07s]  Easy.
[10984.63s -> 10984.87s]  Simple.
[10989.03s -> 10989.75s]  Where's that potion?
[10990.31s -> 10992.02s]  Where's Baron's Brew?
[10992.58s -> 10994.53s]  He was 140.
[10994.53s -> 10995.01s]  Oh, shit.
[10995.01s -> 10995.81s]  That's actually really good.
[10997.81s -> 10998.13s]  Nice.
[10999.09s -> 11001.68s]  This dreamer hates his fans.
[11016.53s -> 11021.59s]  There's a shark?
[11022.40s -> 11023.76s]  That's an awesome Sobex skin.
[11024.32s -> 11030.92s]  I'll take the damage.
[11030.92s -> 11031.80s]  Why not?
[11031.80s -> 11044.56s]  All right.
[11044.56s -> 11045.04s]  Let's get it.
[11045.68s -> 11053.01s]  Learning the moves.
[11053.01s -> 11053.89s]  Just getting the feel for it.
[11054.53s -> 11055.64s]  Don't stand near me.
[11061.65s -> 11062.13s]  Immune.
[11062.85s -> 11068.82s]  I go back.
[11069.38s -> 11071.04s]  Throw it up the graphics.
[11071.04s -> 11072.00s]  Everything's on maximum.
[11072.56s -> 11076.92s]  Turn up.
[11076.92s -> 11078.36s]  Everything is on max.
[11080.07s -> 11080.95s]  Two is a heal.
[11080.95s -> 11086.92s]  Oh, it looks like 720p.
[11088.55s -> 11090.55s]  You're watching it in 720.
[11090.55s -> 11091.59s]  It is 720p.
[11091.59s -> 11092.63s]  It's being downscaled.
[11093.35s -> 11104.64s]  Well, 864p.
[11104.64s -> 11104.88s]  Sorry.
[11104.88s -> 11107.44s]  Wait, we have to help our friends over here.
[11107.44s -> 11113.78s]  I don't know what this does.
[11114.42s -> 11118.10s]  That was cool.
[11118.66s -> 11119.40s]  Whatever it did.
[11120.20s -> 11132.52s]  Are you sure you bought a legitimate 3090?
[11132.52s -> 11134.60s]  Would I have like a bootleg 3090?
[11137.11s -> 11138.31s]  Taped over the side.
[11138.31s -> 11139.51s]  It's like a 1060.
[11147.24s -> 11147.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[11147.72s -> 11148.20s]  That's bad.
[11152.74s -> 11153.62s]  That's bad.
[11153.62s -> 11157.83s]  Why can't you stream in 1080?
[11158.39s -> 11160.82s]  This question comes up pretty frequently.
[11160.82s -> 11162.34s]  But something that we have to keep discussing.
[11163.14s -> 11164.04s]  I will explain it.
[11164.04s -> 11164.76s]  I'll tell you again.
[11165.65s -> 11173.62s]  So Twitch only allows you to have a bit rate of 6,000 upload bit rate.
[11174.90s -> 11182.50s]  A full 1080p video at 6,000 bit rate and 60 fps does not look very good.
[11182.50s -> 11183.54s]  It's not enough.
[11183.54s -> 11188.82s]  The reason why most people stream in 720 or like 860 whatever
[11189.38s -> 11193.38s]  is because that 720 video looks okay at 6,000.
[11201.41s -> 11202.21s]  It's 8k.
[11202.21s -> 11202.69s]  It is not.
[11203.33s -> 11205.99s]  Okay.
[11205.99s -> 11207.27s]  Now I'm going to play the game again.
[11211.22s -> 11214.50s]  Now what people do is they might have a second computer
[11214.50s -> 11215.78s]  that they run the whole thing through
[11215.78s -> 11218.42s]  and they have it on the slowest preset possible for their CPU.
[11219.41s -> 11221.97s]  But if you look at the research,
[11221.97s -> 11224.61s]  like the things that people have done on testing,
[11225.49s -> 11229.81s]  once you go from medium down to slow for the CPU preset,
[11229.81s -> 11235.97s]  you can't even really tell a difference.
[11235.97s -> 11239.49s]  Until we can stream at like 10,000 to 15,000 bit rate up,
[11240.13s -> 11242.28s]  1080, 60 fps is not...
[11242.28s -> 11243.32s]  All right.
[11243.32s -> 11243.88s]  All right.
[11243.88s -> 11244.28s]  Whatever.
[11244.28s -> 11244.76s]  You get it.
[11244.76s -> 11245.72s]  Who cares?
[11245.72s -> 11246.28s]  Who cares?
[11246.28s -> 11246.68s]  I'm done.
[11247.72s -> 11254.28s]  Everyone's calling me a nerd.
[11262.21s -> 11263.65s]  What is this person doing back here?
[11264.45s -> 11266.96s]  He's a tech guy.
[11267.76s -> 11277.65s]  I have not hit that fucking one time.
[11282.23s -> 11282.47s]  All right.
[11282.47s -> 11284.23s]  Let me have a non-embarrassing game.
[11284.87s -> 11285.70s]  Excuse me.
[11315.44s -> 11316.08s]  It's still close.
[11316.08s -> 11316.56s]  All right.
[11316.56s -> 11317.44s]  Let me pull this together.
[11330.60s -> 11332.12s]  I'm just hitting the same guy.
[11332.92s -> 11337.80s]  Thank God.
[11340.95s -> 11342.71s]  He's going to destroy his PC in a rage.
[11355.94s -> 11356.98s]  What the hell are you saying?
[11362.80s -> 11363.84s]  Be toxic this game?
[11367.19s -> 11367.75s]  Why?
[11367.75s -> 11368.63s]  I don't want to be toxic.
[11368.63s -> 11369.19s]  I want to just play.
[11369.83s -> 11376.58s]  Get this guy away from me.
[11382.63s -> 11383.11s]  Come here!
[11389.06s -> 11389.78s]  Oh my goodness.
[11389.78s -> 11393.28s]  This guy, this wrestler.
[11393.28s -> 11393.84s]  Oh my God.
[11393.84s -> 11395.20s]  Am I joking him?
[11395.20s -> 11395.68s]  I joked him.
[11395.68s -> 11396.08s]  Holy shit.
[11396.08s -> 11396.40s]  I win.
[11406.69s -> 11407.33s]  More cooldown?
[11407.33s -> 11408.29s]  What do you think?
[11408.29s -> 11413.97s]  Yeah.
[11413.97s -> 11414.37s]  This one.
[11416.45s -> 11421.30s]  I like sprint.
[11421.30s -> 11421.54s]  I know.
[11421.54s -> 11422.02s]  I'm a noob.
[11431.68s -> 11438.39s]  This is different actors saying the same line auditioning for the same role.
[11452.32s -> 11453.44s]  That was really toxic kind of.
[11453.44s -> 11454.72s]  No, that's not what I'm trying to do.
[11454.72s -> 11455.68s]  What is this person doing?
[11466.84s -> 11467.32s]  Suck him in.
[11467.32s -> 11468.04s]  I don't even know what this does.
[11468.68s -> 11475.49s]  All right.
[11475.49s -> 11476.77s]  What does that actually do?
[11476.77s -> 11477.33s]  What does this do?
[11478.64s -> 11479.04s]  Jesus.
[11479.04s -> 11480.72s]  This is a god damn...
[11480.72s -> 11482.16s]  140 characters Twitter.
[11482.16s -> 11482.72s]  What the fuck?
[11483.28s -> 11486.64s]  Baron pulls the soul of living towards his coffin becoming immune to crowd control.
[11486.64s -> 11486.88s]  Okay.
[11487.68s -> 11490.71s]  So I take 35% less damage.
[11491.27s -> 11493.52s]  Enemies within the range are caught in a vortex.
[11493.52s -> 11497.52s]  Dragging them towards the coffin and taking damage every 30.33 seconds.
[11498.16s -> 11501.36s]  When enemy god gets too close, their soul is ripped out.
[11501.36s -> 11503.04s]  They get stunned and they take a lot of damage.
[11504.55s -> 11504.79s]  Okay.
[11504.79s -> 11505.19s]  I got it.
[11508.66s -> 11510.85s]  Ice award for teleport.
[11511.41s -> 11512.53s]  Ice award for teleport.
[11513.33s -> 11514.61s]  Ice award for teleport.
[11519.67s -> 11521.80s]  You're just gonna let that go in?
[11521.80s -> 11522.68s]  Stop reading.
[11522.68s -> 11523.16s]  What?
[11523.16s -> 11523.80s]  Oh my god.
[11523.80s -> 11524.60s]  What's with you guys?
[11536.28s -> 11536.60s]  Nice.
[11537.24s -> 11542.72s]  Get out of here.
[11542.72s -> 11543.52s]  Get away from me.
[11543.52s -> 11544.32s]  I don't like this guy.
[11544.96s -> 11550.58s]  Let's go.
[11550.58s -> 11559.30s]  Let's work.
[11559.86s -> 11570.39s]  We gotta kill this guy.
[11570.39s -> 11571.59s]  Oh, come the fuck on.
[11571.59s -> 11572.39s]  Kill him.
[11572.39s -> 11573.35s]  Oh my goodness.
[11574.87s -> 11575.11s]  Run.
[11581.57s -> 11581.89s]  What?
[11590.88s -> 11591.12s]  No.
[11592.40s -> 11593.86s]  He's the tank.
[11593.86s -> 11594.58s]  Stop shooting him.
[11602.34s -> 11604.98s]  Yeah, I wanna reduce the healing on that Hercules.
[11606.76s -> 11607.56s]  It's still anybody's game.
[11610.60s -> 11611.48s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[11611.48s -> 11612.20s]  I'm not the tank.
[11613.00s -> 11622.23s]  Here he comes.
[11622.23s -> 11622.87s]  Get away from me.
[11623.75s -> 11624.71s]  That's not fun.
[11624.71s -> 11625.35s]  It's not fair.
[11626.66s -> 11627.30s]  Game's not fair.
[11638.64s -> 11639.20s]  Build boots.
[11645.20s -> 11646.48s]  Why are we even attacking this guy?
[11646.48s -> 11647.04s]  He's just here.
[11652.76s -> 11653.64s]  This guy.
[11653.64s -> 11654.52s]  Get out of here.
[11655.64s -> 11656.76s]  Nobody get this guy.
[11660.21s -> 11662.61s]  Why do I just hear a school cafeteria full of people?
[11666.04s -> 11667.00s]  Don't let him get away with that.
[11667.64s -> 11677.78s]  Oh, I got a ball on the fucking vortex.
[11678.42s -> 11680.98s]  Oh shit.
[11680.98s -> 11681.38s]  Oh shit.
[11681.38s -> 11681.78s]  Oh shit.
[11682.42s -> 11684.93s]  Oh shit.
[11685.57s -> 11687.32s]  Oh shit.
[11687.96s -> 11688.36s]  Oh.
[11700.08s -> 11701.12s]  I thought they were gonna keep walking.
[11727.24s -> 11730.60s]  Stop fucking.
[11730.60s -> 11731.24s]  Oh my god.
[11731.24s -> 11731.96s]  What am I doing?
[11731.96s -> 11732.20s]  Sprint.
[11738.18s -> 11741.30s]  Oh, I had to be like stupid and make a dumb little joke.
[11743.06s -> 11743.54s]  All right.
[11743.54s -> 11745.86s]  Next time I'm gonna play a god that I know what their moves do.
[11746.50s -> 11747.30s]  Okay.
[11747.30s -> 11754.92s]  Streaming smite and picking a god I've never played with before is probably a bad idea,
[11755.64s -> 11756.93s]  but this is a good idea.
[11757.73s -> 11774.45s]  Immune.
[11782.58s -> 11785.84s]  All right.
[11786.40s -> 11786.96s]  All right.
[11786.96s -> 11787.36s]  What do you say?
[11787.36s -> 11787.84s]  Let's pull back.
[11798.00s -> 11798.32s]  Let's go.
[11798.32s -> 11798.80s]  Back it up.
[11798.80s -> 11799.12s]  Back it up.
[11799.12s -> 11799.52s]  Back it up.
[11799.52s -> 11799.76s]  Bad.
[11799.76s -> 11800.00s]  Bad.
[11800.00s -> 11800.56s]  This is a bad idea.
[11801.28s -> 11806.53s]  Oh my god.
[11806.53s -> 11807.81s]  That Hercules is running right at me.
[11811.09s -> 11811.89s]  Ice drop so bad.
[11811.89s -> 11812.13s]  Good.
[11812.69s -> 11822.79s]  All right.
[11822.79s -> 11823.27s]  I want to do...
[11824.15s -> 11825.62s]  Well, cool down.
[11826.26s -> 11828.48s]  Yeah.
[11828.48s -> 11828.88s]  Cool down.
[11829.44s -> 11832.52s]  Ooh.
[11832.52s -> 11833.96s]  That's penetration and cool down.
[11833.96s -> 11834.36s]  Hell yeah.
[11834.84s -> 11836.36s]  I don't even read the paragraph underneath it.
[11837.16s -> 11838.26s]  Just hit me.
[11838.82s -> 11846.12s]  I just absolutely smashed that cube in the face.
[11846.92s -> 11861.91s]  Oh, come on.
[11861.91s -> 11862.79s]  He's so low.
[11862.79s -> 11864.63s]  No, we can't have that.
[11865.35s -> 11877.56s]  City and shards second item.
[11877.56s -> 11879.00s]  I don't know.
[11879.00s -> 11879.72s]  I look...
[11879.72s -> 11880.84s]  This is why I'm playing arena.
[11887.86s -> 11888.74s]  Is that a beach ball?
[11889.54s -> 11897.06s]  You're gonna play tribes ascend?
[11898.63s -> 11903.19s]  Tribes ascend really is probably one of the best FPS games that's ever been made,
[11904.98s -> 11907.78s]  but I wasn't a big fan of all the grenade shit.
[11912.39s -> 11919.44s]  That game's long range skill shots is some of the most satisfying dopamine inducing gaming
[11919.44s -> 11921.20s]  ever that I've ever played in my entire life.
[11922.00s -> 11922.68s]  All right.
[11922.68s -> 11923.08s]  This guy.
[11923.80s -> 11928.00s]  Thank you.
[11946.26s -> 11946.82s]  Stop dying.
[11946.82s -> 11947.86s]  I'm drinking a big soda.
[11947.86s -> 11949.86s]  Every death is almost like you're trying to make me burp.
[11949.86s -> 11950.10s]  What?
[11950.90s -> 11958.95s]  All right.
[11958.95s -> 11961.11s]  I'm gonna play a character that I know what their moves are.
[11963.99s -> 11966.58s]  I'm gonna hear that in my dreams.
[11967.30s -> 11969.52s]  Place a ward for teleport.
[11970.48s -> 11971.92s]  Place a ward for teleport.
[11972.88s -> 11981.30s]  Again, another one.
[11981.30s -> 11988.53s]  We're going conquest.
[11988.53s -> 12001.60s]  You guys ready?
[12001.60s -> 12001.84s]  Okay.
[12003.52s -> 12008.00s]  I have to play the easiest thing.
[12008.64s -> 12018.61s]  What's the solo lane the easiest still?
[12018.61s -> 12019.57s]  No, not support.
[12019.57s -> 12019.97s]  No way.
[12020.61s -> 12022.36s]  Do you mercury impression?
[12022.36s -> 12022.76s]  Sure thing.
[12023.80s -> 12024.82s]  Mercury!
[12024.82s -> 12025.38s]  Mercury!
[12027.52s -> 12029.48s]  Hank Arthur solo is fun.
[12029.48s -> 12031.76s]  Solo I think I could do.
[12031.76s -> 12032.16s]  Mid?
[12032.16s -> 12039.72s]  Yeah, I'll do mid.
[12039.72s -> 12040.28s]  All right.
[12040.28s -> 12044.92s]  Here we go.
[12044.92s -> 12047.04s]  Password.
[12047.04s -> 12048.08s]  Yeah, I'll do mid.
[12048.08s -> 12050.32s]  Not doing solo.
[12053.86s -> 12062.48s]  Very good.
[12062.48s -> 12063.76s]  Nice job.
[12063.76s -> 12075.30s]  You all have very good listening skills.
[12075.30s -> 12079.86s]  Password is I'll go mid with no spaces, no capitals.
[12079.86s -> 12080.98s]  I didn't have to even say it.
[12089.01s -> 12090.53s]  All right, guys, you ready?
[12091.52s -> 12092.24s]  I need to be mid.
[12095.56s -> 12096.04s]  I'm mid.
[12097.54s -> 12100.10s]  Now the question is who should I play with in mid?
[12103.67s -> 12120.08s]  It's either gonna be Anubis, Kronos, Olken, not Hades.
[12120.08s -> 12122.56s]  No, I'm not confident enough to play this game that way.
[12122.56s -> 12125.22s]  It's gonna be Kronos.
[12125.22s -> 12140.32s]  Kronos is ADC.
[12140.32s -> 12141.12s]  No, he's not.
[12141.12s -> 12148.24s]  It's unfair because people are brute forcing the password with quantum computing.
[12148.80s -> 12180.76s]  I was gonna say it's like tag.
[12180.76s -> 12189.40s]  Kronos is not hard.
[12189.40s -> 12190.66s]  Kronos is fun.
[12194.29s -> 12196.61s]  I love playing Kronos because you just kind of ski around and go
[12198.61s -> 12199.57s]  with attack speed.
[12199.57s -> 12205.88s]  He has some of the best sound effects in the game.
[12205.88s -> 12207.57s]  You guys all play.
[12207.57s -> 12209.73s]  Why are people talking to me like they don't play this game?
[12210.45s -> 12213.33s]  You have to have a thousand games on each one of these characters.
[12213.33s -> 12214.53s]  You guys play this game.
[12214.53s -> 12216.96s]  A shitload of you guys play this game all the time.
[12220.32s -> 12222.00s]  Oh, I forgot this was an arena.
[12222.00s -> 12222.88s]  I just pressed one.
[12222.88s -> 12223.20s]  Whoops.
[12225.16s -> 12225.48s]  All right.
[12225.48s -> 12226.68s]  How do I play Conquest?
[12226.68s -> 12227.48s]  You guys have to carry me.
[12231.09s -> 12232.29s]  Okay, you owe me 1500 gold.
[12237.44s -> 12238.40s]  What do I buy?
[12238.40s -> 12241.48s]  There's no boots.
[12242.36s -> 12244.10s]  I'm just gonna do this.
[12244.10s -> 12245.46s]  This is attack speed and this is okay.
[12247.62s -> 12249.20s]  Are these free?
[12249.20s -> 12261.64s]  Yeah, Kronos is a lot of fun.
[12261.64s -> 12263.80s]  I know that you have to I have to go get the buffs, right?
[12263.80s -> 12264.44s]  And help people.
[12264.44s -> 12280.10s]  I don't know anything about rotating the ultimate.
[12280.10s -> 12285.60s]  And why doesn't Smite do stuff like this?
[12285.60s -> 12288.24s]  Just get like a bunch of really good like pro players.
[12288.24s -> 12291.84s]  And then one like eight year old that plays mid.
[12291.84s -> 12297.72s]  All right, here we go.
[12304.29s -> 12307.89s]  One of the reasons why I like Smite is because last hitting really is not make or break the whole game.
[12308.61s -> 12310.69s]  It adds a little bit, but it's not the worst thing in the world.
[12319.49s -> 12320.21s]  All right, okay.
[12320.77s -> 12324.53s]  I think that's free, right?
[12324.53s -> 12331.54s]  Here they come, here they come.
[12331.54s -> 12332.58s]  I don't even know how to say anything.
[12332.58s -> 12333.38s]  Wait, I'm streaming.
[12334.74s -> 12345.32s]  Watch out.
[12345.32s -> 12345.88s]  Save yourself.
[12345.88s -> 12356.29s]  They can hear me talking.
[12356.29s -> 12356.85s]  Yeah, I can.
[12356.85s -> 12357.57s]  This is fine.
[12357.57s -> 12359.17s]  I don't have to do any like VGS or anything.
[12361.60s -> 12362.88s]  Athena's going left.
[12362.88s -> 12364.71s]  Athena going left lane.
[12371.54s -> 12372.42s]  Gank coming middle lane.
[12372.42s -> 12373.46s]  Gank incoming middle lane.
[12374.42s -> 12375.22s]  Gank incoming.
[12377.24s -> 12377.48s]  Fuck.
[12386.74s -> 12388.02s]  This is gonna be a long match.
[12392.74s -> 12394.50s]  I don't even have enough money to buy anything.
[12394.50s -> 12396.12s]  I need wards, right?
[12396.12s -> 12397.48s]  No, that's not my job.
[12397.48s -> 12405.40s]  I don't know what my job is.
[12405.40s -> 12406.92s]  All right, that's fine.
[12406.92s -> 12407.64s]  Nice work.
[12407.64s -> 12415.70s]  Remember the other team can hear you too.
[12415.70s -> 12418.44s]  That's right.
[12418.44s -> 12420.92s]  Oh shit, this is a bad like kind of leak.
[12427.51s -> 12428.31s]  Thank you.
[12428.31s -> 12438.93s]  All right, back to it.
[12438.93s -> 12452.31s]  What was that?
[12452.31s -> 12454.63s]  Enemy is continuing to be in middle lane.
[12454.63s -> 12463.00s]  I'm not pushing up too far.
[12463.00s -> 12464.36s]  I don't want to get in trouble here.
[12464.36s -> 12465.48s]  There's an enemy in middle lane.
[12465.48s -> 12466.36s]  Enemy in mid.
[12466.36s -> 12467.16s]  Enemy in mid lane.
[12467.16s -> 12467.96s]  Gank incoming.
[12473.54s -> 12474.90s]  Wait, people can see my map.
[12475.30s -> 12476.72s]  Oh shit.
[12477.44s -> 12481.54s]  What do I do about this?
[12481.54s -> 12493.22s]  What do I do about this?
[12493.22s -> 12494.18s]  Okay, that's better, right?
[12498.23s -> 12499.51s]  Okay, now I understand.
[12499.51s -> 12500.47s]  There we go.
[12500.47s -> 12501.65s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12501.65s -> 12502.45s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12502.45s -> 12503.25s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12503.81s -> 12506.10s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12506.10s -> 12510.80s]  Can I help you?
[12518.07s -> 12518.87s]  Gank left lane.
[12518.87s -> 12519.83s]  Gank left lane.
[12519.83s -> 12520.15s]  Get him.
[12523.67s -> 12524.47s]  I missed everything.
[12525.19s -> 12527.25s]  I have no mana.
[12527.25s -> 12528.37s]  Oh shit, I don't have any mana.
[12532.18s -> 12533.94s]  I don't think I can do this by streaming this.
[12534.58s -> 12538.79s]  This is too much pressure.
[12538.79s -> 12539.59s]  I don't like this.
[12541.03s -> 12543.43s]  Okay, you want to know the last time I played Conquest?
[12543.43s -> 12546.24s]  2017.
[12546.24s -> 12547.84s]  Or probably 2016.
[12547.84s -> 12560.32s]  I've only played Arena and Assault since like 2017.
[12560.32s -> 12562.00s]  I don't, this is too much pressure.
[12562.00s -> 12562.88s]  It's too much.
[12562.88s -> 12567.38s]  A fake map up there?
[12568.02s -> 12570.58s]  I probably shouldn't have played Khronos either.
[12570.58s -> 12573.14s]  Oh man, I'm trying to like look good for this stream.
[12573.86s -> 12575.06s]  Yeah, I'm gonna play Khronos.
[12575.06s -> 12578.02s]  Like he's got like a complicated kind of number two move.
[12578.02s -> 12579.30s]  Well, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[12580.02s -> 12589.17s]  Okay, enemy has returned middle.
[12589.17s -> 12598.98s]  I'm afraid to go any further than this.
[12598.98s -> 12607.38s]  Well, they all know.
[12608.85s -> 12611.09s]  This was never gonna work out the way that I thought, right?
[12611.89s -> 12621.62s]  It's all right.
[12621.62s -> 12624.50s]  Hey, if we win, look, they have such an advantage.
[12630.58s -> 12631.30s]  They're all here.
[12640.34s -> 12642.44s]  Hopefully you can get out.
[12642.44s -> 12646.37s]  All right, I gotta go back.
[12646.37s -> 12648.37s]  Just cover your whole screen.
[12649.01s -> 12652.00s]  We're not playing Conquest again.
[12652.00s -> 12654.64s]  Okay, didn't I say earlier?
[12654.64s -> 12655.96s]  I did.
[12655.96s -> 12659.24s]  I said earlier that I am not going to play Conquest
[12659.24s -> 12661.30s]  unless it's a comedy game.
[12661.46s -> 12662.58s]  What am I doing?
[12662.58s -> 12663.54s]  Why are we doing this?
[12663.54s -> 12666.18s]  Honestly, God, what am I doing?
[12666.18s -> 12673.54s]  I just have to try not to die.
[12673.54s -> 12674.74s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12674.74s -> 12684.26s]  Enemy still missing middle.
[12684.26s -> 12702.60s]  All right, I need to level up.
[12702.60s -> 12703.32s]  See, they know.
[12703.32s -> 12703.88s]  They know.
[12703.88s -> 12705.57s]  I can't gank anybody.
[12705.57s -> 12706.45s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12706.45s -> 12715.19s]  Covering the map only helps.
[12715.19s -> 12715.99s]  God damn it.
[12716.55s -> 12729.48s]  Oh, thank you.
[12729.48s -> 12736.00s]  Yeah, we're gonna play arena and assault only.
[12736.56s -> 12744.42s]  Enemy missing middle still.
[12745.06s -> 12747.25s]  I have no idea where the hell they are.
[12747.25s -> 12751.88s]  Oh, they're back.
[12751.88s -> 12757.60s]  Enemy missing left.
[12757.60s -> 12758.72s]  Enemy missing left.
[12758.72s -> 12774.07s]  Enemy missing.
[12774.07s -> 12774.87s]  I found them.
[12775.99s -> 12776.79s]  I found their hair.
[12785.94s -> 12788.34s]  All right, they're coming to the end of the road.
[12788.34s -> 12803.99s]  Just look at my game, you'll know.
[12803.99s -> 12804.55s]  Okay.
[12804.55s -> 12810.44s]  I think everyone's rotating to the left side.
[12810.44s -> 12812.16s]  Team fight incoming.
[12812.16s -> 12815.43s]  It's time to do a team fight.
[12815.43s -> 12816.39s]  Never mind.
[12816.39s -> 12818.00s]  Everybody run away.
[12818.00s -> 12818.96s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12818.96s -> 12820.08s]  Stay there, stay there, stay there, stay there.
[12820.08s -> 12820.64s]  Check this shit out.
[12820.64s -> 12821.68s]  I'm gonna clean it up.
[12821.68s -> 12827.96s]  Did I get killed?
[12827.96s -> 12831.92s]  That's our tower.
[12831.92s -> 12833.06s]  What am I doing?
[12833.06s -> 12833.78s]  Enemy missing middle.
[12840.15s -> 12840.71s]  I missed.
[12840.71s -> 12841.27s]  Whatever.
[12841.27s -> 12844.36s]  Enemy has returned middle.
[12844.36s -> 12856.88s]  Enemy missed.
[12856.88s -> 12868.34s]  No, they're here.
[12868.34s -> 12868.84s]  Ooh.
[12871.99s -> 12873.27s]  I need to go back and buy.
[12873.27s -> 12887.68s]  I'm so afraid to move forward.
[12887.68s -> 12888.18s]  All right.
[12888.80s -> 12889.44s]  Careful.
[12889.44s -> 12892.42s]  I have to go back.
[12892.42s -> 12893.75s]  I have to go back.
[12893.75s -> 12896.26s]  Be careful.
[12896.26s -> 12898.02s]  Mid is making a...
[12898.02s -> 12898.66s]  What are you doing?
[12899.62s -> 12909.73s]  Oh, I...
[12909.73s -> 12910.29s]  Sorry.
[12910.29s -> 12921.41s]  He thinks he's funny.
[12924.74s -> 12928.26s]  I'm not trying to be funny right now.
[12928.26s -> 12931.54s]  I'm trying not to embarrass myself and die like nine times.
[12931.54s -> 12940.10s]  Enemy is missing middle.
[12940.10s -> 12949.35s]  I have no idea where they are.
[12949.35s -> 12949.99s]  Hey, whoa.
[12951.11s -> 12961.62s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[12961.62s -> 12962.82s]  They were just waiting for me.
[12962.82s -> 12971.19s]  They're streaming Smite in 2021.
[12971.19s -> 12972.96s]  You're already embarrassing.
[12972.96s -> 12973.60s]  Get out of here.
[12980.50s -> 12981.38s]  Nine times?
[12981.38s -> 12981.62s]  No.
[12982.26s -> 12983.78s]  I'm not gonna die more than six times.
[12985.32s -> 12986.60s]  Can I even buy anything?
[12986.60s -> 12987.76s]  I'm just gonna buy this.
[12987.76s -> 12999.76s]  Whatever it is.
[12999.76s -> 13000.48s]  Okay.
[13000.48s -> 13007.35s]  Enemy is attacking the middle tower and I'm gonna show them to respect me.
[13007.91s -> 13015.96s]  See?
[13019.06s -> 13019.38s]  Yeah.
[13019.38s -> 13020.02s]  Oh, yeah.
[13020.02s -> 13020.74s]  Everybody.
[13020.74s -> 13021.78s]  Here comes Jeremy.
[13021.78s -> 13023.06s]  Oh, everybody move in.
[13023.06s -> 13023.94s]  The infield moves in.
[13023.94s -> 13024.98s]  The outfield moves in.
[13024.98s -> 13025.54s]  Oh, yeah.
[13025.54s -> 13027.06s]  He can't hit past our heads.
[13027.62s -> 13028.10s]  No.
[13028.10s -> 13028.74s]  No way.
[13028.74s -> 13029.22s]  Just keep...
[13029.22s -> 13030.02s]  Yeah.
[13030.02s -> 13031.14s]  Everybody move the fuck in.
[13031.78s -> 13035.36s]  This is when I do a little blooper over the left fielder's head
[13035.36s -> 13037.36s]  because he's playing where the fucking shortstop would be.
[13038.08s -> 13040.20s]  There it goes.
[13040.36s -> 13041.16s]  There it goes.
[13042.47s -> 13044.15s]  And I'm gonna get an inside the park home run.
[13044.95s -> 13050.76s]  I'm scared of that.
[13056.05s -> 13056.77s]  Watch it.
[13056.77s -> 13057.57s]  This is bad news.
[13059.27s -> 13059.99s]  Yeah, this is bad news.
[13060.79s -> 13061.43s]  This is bad.
[13061.43s -> 13061.91s]  Bad news.
[13063.84s -> 13064.56s]  Why did I just do that?
[13064.56s -> 13065.04s]  I was supposed to...
[13067.68s -> 13075.72s]  All right.
[13075.72s -> 13076.36s]  I'm fine.
[13076.36s -> 13081.44s]  It's too much pressure to play this game.
[13081.44s -> 13082.48s]  I'm not playing this ever again.
[13085.11s -> 13086.15s]  Arena Assault or Fun?
[13086.15s -> 13087.03s]  I'm not doing this again.
[13101.52s -> 13108.53s]  End of Smite Thursdays?
[13108.53s -> 13112.20s]  Well, like all MOBAs, this is important too.
[13112.20s -> 13114.36s]  There was an ever-ticking-down bar
[13114.92s -> 13117.41s]  that is hovering over your head when you play a MOBA.
[13118.56s -> 13121.60s]  If you do not play, the bar continues to tick down.
[13122.80s -> 13129.48s]  Every day you play, you are keeping the bar just barely not moving at all
[13129.48s -> 13131.80s]  and maybe gaining a little bit of progress.
[13132.44s -> 13135.68s]  This game requires that...
[13135.68s -> 13136.18s]  Whoa!
[13142.15s -> 13145.97s]  If you don't play this game for a week, the bar goes to zero.
[13146.53s -> 13158.34s]  You dashed into the...
[13160.36s -> 13163.08s]  If you do not play this game for a full week,
[13163.08s -> 13166.00s]  you need to redo the whole thing all over again.
[13166.08s -> 13173.40s]  What does the bar represent?
[13173.40s -> 13175.16s]  Your skill in a MOBA.
[13175.16s -> 13186.96s]  Okay.
[13186.96s -> 13189.68s]  Before I look at chat and walk into walls, let's get back in here.
[13189.68s -> 13193.36s]  All right.
[13193.36s -> 13194.24s]  I didn't die nine times.
[13194.24s -> 13197.19s]  I'm fine.
[13197.19s -> 13198.39s]  I think it's a skill issue.
[13198.39s -> 13200.55s]  Get some better game sense, idiot.
[13200.55s -> 13207.80s]  Guys, I couldn't even tell you what all these buffs on the minimap do.
[13207.80s -> 13208.84s]  Get a better game sense.
[13209.40s -> 13211.88s]  Time that guy out for like fucking three days.
[13211.88s -> 13218.63s]  Permanently.
[13218.63s -> 13221.89s]  Ten minutes.
[13221.89s -> 13222.37s]  All right.
[13222.37s -> 13239.56s]  Is there any missing middle?
[13239.56s -> 13240.04s]  Oh, no.
[13240.04s -> 13241.16s]  There's somebody here.
[13241.16s -> 13242.52s]  You wouldn't be doing this if somebody wasn't here.
[13244.40s -> 13245.36s]  Holy shit.
[13245.36s -> 13246.56s]  I just instantly died.
[13246.56s -> 13247.06s]  Fuck.
[13251.65s -> 13252.69s]  I'm just feeding.
[13253.78s -> 13257.46s]  You can't play Conquest unless you play Conquest every single day.
[13257.46s -> 13258.10s]  That's a fact.
[13258.98s -> 13263.06s]  Like, if you are not playing Conquest, don't play Conquest.
[13275.96s -> 13276.36s]  Uh-oh.
[13276.36s -> 13277.32s]  Little brother down.
[13277.32s -> 13278.36s]  Little brother down.
[13278.36s -> 13278.68s]  Get...
[13278.68s -> 13279.16s]  We need help.
[13279.16s -> 13280.20s]  Little brother down.
[13280.20s -> 13286.28s]  And actually, I'm going to defend myself here.
[13286.28s -> 13289.24s]  We're playing with people in the game that have like 500 games
[13289.24s -> 13290.92s]  played on the gods they're playing right now.
[13290.92s -> 13294.16s]  They're like all exes.
[13294.16s -> 13295.44s]  I'm little brother Andy.
[13295.44s -> 13296.72s]  I can't compete with this shit.
[13297.36s -> 13312.82s]  Don't let him steal it.
[13312.82s -> 13313.94s]  Don't let him steal it.
[13313.94s -> 13324.74s]  Don't go too far.
[13324.74s -> 13325.70s]  Don't go too far.
[13340.10s -> 13343.30s]  Where's a time machine where I can like not queue up for Conquest?
[13344.18s -> 13354.74s]  If I had three wishes, one of them would be to not play Conquest tonight.
[13355.38s -> 13359.27s]  The genie comes out of the fucking container.
[13359.83s -> 13361.86s]  What are your three wishes?
[13361.86s -> 13362.66s]  You have three.
[13362.66s -> 13363.78s]  What are they?
[13363.78s -> 13365.38s]  I don't want to...
[13365.38s -> 13366.82s]  Make it so I didn't play Conquest.
[13366.82s -> 13367.94s]  We just kept playing assault.
[13368.82s -> 13369.62s]  You sure?
[13369.62s -> 13370.12s]  Yes.
[13371.52s -> 13374.00s]  You seem a little shaky and a little pissed off and nervous.
[13374.00s -> 13376.56s]  You don't want to take five minutes to like cool down and...
[13376.56s -> 13377.04s]  No.
[13377.04s -> 13377.76s]  No, do it now.
[13384.90s -> 13385.40s]  Okay.
[13393.72s -> 13395.64s]  This guy keeps feeding my games.
[13402.53s -> 13406.37s]  We're gonna be here for like another 40 minutes and I'm gonna die like 30 fucking times.
[13406.37s -> 13412.13s]  I'm gonna die so many times.
[13412.13s -> 13413.09s]  Just accept...
[13413.09s -> 13414.53s]  Accept it at this point.
[13414.53s -> 13417.41s]  It's gonna be a horrendous embarrassing moment.
[13417.41s -> 13425.09s]  Wait, this is a custom game and I am in complete control?
[13426.24s -> 13439.86s]  Are you serious?
[13439.86s -> 13440.42s]  Yeah.
[13440.42s -> 13442.90s]  Only reason why you knew where I was is because you have fucking Game Genie on.
[13442.90s -> 13443.46s]  All right.
[13443.46s -> 13444.98s]  They got Game Genie.
[13444.98s -> 13446.10s]  They're just literally watching.
[13446.10s -> 13447.14s]  They have Game Genie stream.
[13447.14s -> 13447.54s]  All right.
[13447.54s -> 13452.66s]  I'm gonna delete it.
[13452.66s -> 13453.78s]  No one's gonna hit F7.
[13454.42s -> 13457.56s]  You know how hard it is to get into a game right now?
[13458.28s -> 13459.91s]  Think about it.
[13460.63s -> 13462.93s]  There's like 10,000 people here.
[13463.65s -> 13466.45s]  If you get into a game on this stream,
[13467.33s -> 13469.48s]  you're not gonna want to hit the surrender button.
[13469.48s -> 13471.00s]  You're gonna want to play this out.
[13471.00s -> 13482.76s]  Let's see if I can pull this back.
[13482.76s -> 13487.68s]  Let me pull this back.
[13487.68s -> 13490.68s]  We're not doing very well.
[13496.15s -> 13497.27s]  Just mess with the settings.
[13498.28s -> 13499.24s]  I don't think I can do that.
[13511.97s -> 13514.61s]  They can just see everything we're doing.
[13526.24s -> 13535.11s]  She had the thanks for the 10 community subs.
[13535.11s -> 13535.51s]  Watch out.
[13535.51s -> 13536.47s]  We're gonna get collapsed on.
[13537.03s -> 13548.31s]  It seems like an airplane.
[13559.83s -> 13560.47s]  Oh, shit.
[13560.47s -> 13561.03s]  This is bad.
[13563.00s -> 13563.48s]  Oh, God.
[13572.95s -> 13573.83s]  Oh, my God.
[13579.70s -> 13579.94s]  Okay.
[13579.94s -> 13580.58s]  Everything's all right.
[13588.05s -> 13588.53s]  Kill them?
[13588.53s -> 13588.93s]  I can't.
[13588.93s -> 13591.25s]  I'm Kronos with like two items.
[13591.81s -> 13614.36s]  Click on their head.
[13614.92s -> 13621.67s]  Who's the best cookie in Cookie Run?
[13622.23s -> 13622.55s]  I don't know.
[13622.55s -> 13623.67s]  They all do the same fucking thing.
[13639.52s -> 13641.92s]  We have one and eight, two and five, zero and eight, one and seven.
[13641.92s -> 13643.84s]  But it's all my fault though because I'm bad.
[13643.84s -> 13645.36s]  I'm like, it's my fault.
[13651.33s -> 13652.45s]  You had somebody in mid.
[13653.76s -> 13656.08s]  Amaze will be playing with their eyes closed.
[13656.08s -> 13675.03s]  Remember for God, why he stopped playing this?
[13675.03s -> 13675.51s]  No, no.
[13675.51s -> 13679.03s]  I just told you I have to play like 100 games of this.
[13679.67s -> 13685.41s]  You don't just open up Smite after four years and play Conquest
[13685.41s -> 13687.97s]  with a bunch of fucking level 10 legendary players.
[13699.80s -> 13701.08s]  You are right now.
[13701.08s -> 13701.24s]  Yeah.
[13701.24s -> 13703.16s]  And I'm telling you that it's not.
[13703.16s -> 13704.36s]  It's probably a bad idea.
[13718.21s -> 13718.53s]  What?
[13718.53s -> 13719.25s]  Did we swear?
[13732.18s -> 13733.62s]  Just let them take it.
[13733.62s -> 13734.26s]  Let them win.
[13737.43s -> 13737.99s]  Let them win.
[13738.71s -> 13739.67s]  It's not gonna happen.
[13739.67s -> 13741.19s]  Let them dive the fucking fountain on me.
[13741.27s -> 13741.99s]  I know they want to.
[13752.72s -> 13754.92s]  No, that was not.
[13754.92s -> 13755.56s]  That was 10.
[13756.76s -> 13757.64s]  Oh my goodness.
[13773.75s -> 13781.11s]  This Bologna is like, is just carrying our whole team.
[13781.11s -> 13781.35s]  Okay.
[13781.35s -> 13782.47s]  That was a Conquest.
[13782.47s -> 13784.55s]  We're literally never doing that ever again.
[13786.55s -> 13789.35s]  You will never see that on this stream ever again.
[13789.35s -> 13790.87s]  Ever.
[13790.87s -> 13791.91s]  Not in 100 years.
[13791.91s -> 13794.13s]  So let's go back to Assault.
[13794.13s -> 13794.61s]  That was fun.
[13803.06s -> 13807.86s]  100 years will have to go by before I do that ever again.
[13807.86s -> 13827.73s]  Yeah.
[13827.73s -> 13828.85s]  I can get rid of the minimap now.
[13828.85s -> 13832.68s]  Yeah.
[13832.68s -> 13833.40s]  One in 10.
[13833.40s -> 13834.04s]  One in 10.
[13834.60s -> 13835.00s]  Yeah.
[13835.00s -> 13836.84s]  I'm not even gonna have that.
[13836.84s -> 13838.20s]  I'm not even gonna give a response to that.
[13839.06s -> 13840.50s]  I'm not gonna even give a response.
[13841.06s -> 13842.28s]  But let me tell you.
[13842.84s -> 13853.09s]  Whoever gets this password, seriously, I have no idea how you would know this.
[13861.41s -> 13862.53s]  Thanks for playing though.
[13862.53s -> 13866.13s]  That was the worst gamer moment.
[13866.13s -> 13867.01s]  That's not fair.
[13867.01s -> 13868.29s]  It's a team game.
[13868.29s -> 13870.37s]  If that was a 1v1, then sure.
[13870.37s -> 13880.66s]  But that's a team game.
[13880.66s -> 13881.22s]  Oh shit.
[13881.22s -> 13882.50s]  I don't even know what the password is.
[13882.50s -> 13885.28s]  I already forgot it.
[13886.85s -> 13887.33s]  What was it?
[13889.41s -> 13889.65s]  Okay.
[13889.65s -> 13890.45s]  I remember.
[13890.45s -> 13891.89s]  All right.
[13891.89s -> 13893.09s]  So the password, I'll give you one hint.
[13893.09s -> 13893.81s]  It's an animal.
[13893.81s -> 13895.49s]  That has to do with an animal.
[13905.01s -> 13906.37s]  Some would say my favorite animal.
[13906.93s -> 13911.67s]  I would take a guess.
[13912.31s -> 13920.12s]  And it's how I feel about this particular animal.
[13920.12s -> 13935.65s]  That's what I think about them.
[13935.65s -> 13936.93s]  Still stumped, I think.
[13936.93s -> 13949.51s]  It starts with the animal's name.
[13949.51s -> 13952.47s]  And they are something.
[13952.47s -> 13960.52s]  They are something, aren't they?
[13960.52s -> 13970.00s]  Nice job.
[13970.00s -> 13971.51s]  Nice job.
[13971.51s -> 13971.99s]  All right.
[13971.99s -> 13972.79s]  They're getting it.
[13972.79s -> 13982.98s]  I wonder what you're gonna...
[13982.98s -> 13986.63s]  Well, you can't play Cabrac and it's assault.
[13986.63s -> 13990.31s]  The password is frogsareawesome with no capitals and no spaces.
[13990.31s -> 13998.76s]  How long have I been streaming for?
[14001.65s -> 14002.05s]  Really?
[14002.05s -> 14002.61s]  Four hours?
[14004.95s -> 14005.75s]  Oh no.
[14005.75s -> 14007.03s]  Somebody switch with me, please.
[14007.03s -> 14008.50s]  I don't know how to play...
[14008.50s -> 14010.98s]  I don't know how to play any of the characters that are on the screen.
[14010.98s -> 14013.88s]  I don't know how to play Achilles.
[14014.52s -> 14014.92s]  But sure.
[14014.92s -> 14015.80s]  Achilles.
[14015.80s -> 14016.76s]  Does anyone else want to switch?
[14017.48s -> 14018.98s]  Okay.
[14026.60s -> 14028.04s]  I don't want to play as that guy.
[14030.53s -> 14031.49s]  Stop.
[14031.49s -> 14039.92s]  I don't know how to play that character.
[14039.92s -> 14040.64s]  No.
[14040.64s -> 14044.53s]  I have to play with the character.
[14044.53s -> 14045.97s]  At least I know what their moves do.
[14045.97s -> 14060.42s]  You get a heal with blue orbs.
[14060.42s -> 14062.66s]  Yeah, I think I figured that out pretty late last time.
[14062.66s -> 14070.34s]  I can't tell you how internally happy I am
[14070.34s -> 14071.94s]  that we're not in that Conquest game anymore.
[14072.50s -> 14074.53s]  Nothing against the players that were there.
[14074.53s -> 14076.29s]  Like, I'm sure it was a lot of fun for you guys.
[14076.29s -> 14078.13s]  It was pretty cool to play.
[14078.13s -> 14080.23s]  Well, man, I'm so glad I'm not in that game anymore.
[14080.23s -> 14083.44s]  I'm so happy to be in assault again.
[14099.62s -> 14101.62s]  Salty gamer makes windows noise.
[14101.62s -> 14102.66s]  No, I'm not even salty.
[14102.66s -> 14105.14s]  I'm just embarrassed and sad.
[14105.14s -> 14108.79s]  I'm not.
[14108.79s -> 14109.27s]  I'm kidding.
[14109.27s -> 14110.07s]  I'm fine.
[14110.07s -> 14112.36s]  It's a game of Smite.
[14112.36s -> 14113.57s]  Oh, I'm just...
[14114.37s -> 14116.69s]  I'm just so sad about that and embarrassed.
[14116.69s -> 14117.33s]  It's a game of...
[14117.33s -> 14118.69s]  It's a game of Smite.
[14118.69s -> 14119.25s]  Relax.
[14119.25s -> 14120.21s]  It's gonna be fine, Jeremy.
[14120.93s -> 14121.43s]  Who cares?
[14122.29s -> 14123.84s]  It's fine.
[14123.84s -> 14124.24s]  Let's go.
[14126.00s -> 14133.44s]  These are expensive, but I want it.
[14133.44s -> 14139.01s]  Can I just get five of them?
[14139.01s -> 14140.00s]  And mana?
[14144.40s -> 14145.27s]  Here, let's go.
[14147.97s -> 14148.93s]  Is he actually mad?
[14151.64s -> 14152.52s]  Yeah, I actually am.
[14153.08s -> 14155.59s]  I'm very mad.
[14155.59s -> 14159.33s]  Jeremy, I got a little bit of milkshake left.
[14159.33s -> 14160.21s]  Do you want it?
[14160.21s -> 14161.09s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[14161.65s -> 14162.95s]  It's exactly the kind of shit I'm talking about.
[14162.95s -> 14164.79s]  I can't have a sip of that milkshake.
[14164.79s -> 14165.99s]  I don't know who the fuck you are.
[14165.99s -> 14166.63s]  I don't know where you are.
[14166.63s -> 14167.27s]  I don't know who you are.
[14167.91s -> 14169.96s]  And now I have to think about having a milkshake
[14169.96s -> 14171.00s]  and how delicious that would be.
[14171.00s -> 14172.20s]  And now I'm pissed off now.
[14173.64s -> 14175.08s]  God, it's so hard to be me.
[14176.44s -> 14179.48s]  God, I'm so fucking annoyed right now.
[14189.19s -> 14190.58s]  All right, let's go.
[14190.58s -> 14191.38s]  It's time for fun.
[14191.94s -> 14196.98s]  I freaked him out.
[14196.98s -> 14197.78s]  I freaked him out wicked bad.
[14216.32s -> 14217.52s]  Did we not kill anybody?
[14217.52s -> 14218.16s]  We did, right?
[14219.48s -> 14220.28s]  No, we didn't.
[14231.76s -> 14234.96s]  I thought that that was going to really just jostle everybody.
[14243.11s -> 14246.42s]  I think we're okay.
[14247.06s -> 14248.34s]  All right, let's go.
[14248.34s -> 14248.66s]  Quiet.
[14249.62s -> 14250.34s]  I'm going to place my...
[14251.14s -> 14268.61s]  Oh, somebody else get that.
[14268.61s -> 14269.41s]  I don't need it.
[14269.41s -> 14270.13s]  I shouldn't just get it.
[14284.63s -> 14285.11s]  Geez.
[14288.08s -> 14288.40s]  Geez.
[14289.28s -> 14289.92s]  Oh, geez.
[14291.32s -> 14292.04s]  Oh, geez.
[14292.60s -> 14305.97s]  Oh, geez.
[14305.97s -> 14306.61s]  They're going to get it.
[14314.47s -> 14315.27s]  Really?
[14315.27s -> 14317.67s]  That was so close.
[14317.67s -> 14318.47s]  That was dead.
[14336.90s -> 14337.62s]  Oh, fuck.
[14338.18s -> 14340.07s]  Backflip, please.
[14345.24s -> 14345.96s]  Who's doing that?
[14345.96s -> 14347.24s]  What character is that?
[14347.24s -> 14350.00s]  Is that Knox's move?
[14350.72s -> 14353.54s]  Who has that move?
[14362.88s -> 14372.13s]  What do I need to drink every time Jerma dies?
[14374.13s -> 14374.69s]  Don't do that.
[14375.41s -> 14377.56s]  I'm very, very concerned about your health.
[14390.79s -> 14391.19s]  Block it.
[14400.64s -> 14401.52s]  Nice.
[14401.52s -> 14402.08s]  Very nice.
[14409.48s -> 14411.48s]  That's exactly what we needed to have happen.
[14411.48s -> 14412.12s]  Good job.
[14412.12s -> 14413.80s]  That was the Achilles in the Gilgamesh.
[14413.80s -> 14416.28s]  Nice job.
[14416.28s -> 14417.72s]  I'm not even looking at the screen.
[14417.72s -> 14418.28s]  Oh, my God.
[14418.28s -> 14419.08s]  Please don't kill me.
[14423.08s -> 14424.68s]  I wasn't even looking.
[14424.68s -> 14425.96s]  I was looking at chat.
[14435.27s -> 14437.35s]  I did not realize that it was on me.
[14437.35s -> 14439.27s]  I thought that we had a bunch of minions in there.
[14439.83s -> 14441.51s]  Oh, Jesus.
[14442.08s -> 14442.32s]  Okay.
[14458.20s -> 14463.12s]  This game looks like it would be in a movie about video games
[14463.12s -> 14465.76s]  made by people who will never have played video games.
[14466.66s -> 14468.18s]  Like, but this is the thing that's on the screen
[14468.18s -> 14469.78s]  that's like the generic video game.
[14473.81s -> 14475.17s]  I think this game actually looks pretty good.
[14475.97s -> 14478.08s]  I think it's actually like a really nice looking game.
[14478.64s -> 14485.43s]  Oh, that's not good.
[14485.43s -> 14501.40s]  What was that?
[14504.64s -> 14514.15s]  Oh, get him.
[14514.95s -> 14515.35s]  What?
[14515.35s -> 14516.07s]  Oh, come on.
[14521.89s -> 14522.45s]  This is so...
[14523.09s -> 14524.45s]  We're getting stomped right now.
[14527.09s -> 14527.49s]  No, we're not.
[14531.97s -> 14532.61s]  How did I miss it?
[14533.94s -> 14534.34s]  Almost.
[14534.98s -> 14542.20s]  Get away from me.
[14542.20s -> 14542.60s]  Jesus.
[14543.16s -> 14548.96s]  Yeah, that's right.
[14548.96s -> 14549.84s]  All the people can walk into it.
[14549.84s -> 14550.24s]  That's right.
[14550.80s -> 14567.35s]  What is that?
[14567.99s -> 14576.96s]  Does this game have twitchy modes?
[14576.96s -> 14578.32s]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[14578.32s -> 14580.16s]  I think it's some kind of skin or something.
[14585.70s -> 14586.34s]  Oh, fuck.
[14586.34s -> 14587.06s]  I'm in trouble here.
[14587.86s -> 14589.32s]  Did I just get picked out of the air?
[14591.80s -> 14593.88s]  Oh, we're getting kind of beat here.
[14607.46s -> 14608.18s]  Oh, and four.
[14610.16s -> 14612.64s]  We're getting collectively beat, okay?
[14613.52s -> 14614.80s]  We're getting collectively beat.
[14614.80s -> 14616.00s]  I don't want to hear oh, and four.
[14616.00s -> 14618.80s]  I want to hear collectively beat Omega Low.
[14618.80s -> 14621.20s]  Collectively beat Omega Low, okay?
[14639.88s -> 14641.56s]  There we go.
[14641.56s -> 14641.88s]  All right.
[14644.50s -> 14646.96s]  We don't have a tower anymore.
[14646.96s -> 14647.52s]  That's right.
[14647.52s -> 14658.64s]  Everyone, have you ever hit an auto attack?
[14660.66s -> 14661.38s]  This game?
[14661.38s -> 14661.62s]  Yeah.
[14667.08s -> 14667.32s]  Lag.
[14667.88s -> 14669.54s]  That's why this is happening.
[14670.58s -> 14671.22s]  Just lagged out.
[14671.94s -> 14689.81s]  Get that balona.
[14723.17s -> 14723.49s]  Kill.
[14724.29s -> 14727.65s]  Move.
[14728.53s -> 14728.93s]  We got it.
[14729.89s -> 14730.85s]  I didn't get any of those.
[14731.41s -> 14732.37s]  I thought I got one.
[14733.09s -> 14735.89s]  Don't let this thing kill me, please.
[14735.89s -> 14737.17s]  That's another embarrassing moment.
[14737.73s -> 14740.85s]  Is it hitting me?
[14741.41s -> 14742.21s]  I'm so concerned.
[14764.18s -> 14765.06s]  We go?
[14765.06s -> 14765.84s]  Holy shit.
[14765.84s -> 14767.20s]  Are we going to just roll this?
[14767.20s -> 14767.60s]  No way.
[14768.16s -> 14768.80s]  Oh, this is bad.
[14769.60s -> 14772.77s]  Run.
[14780.34s -> 14788.52s]  Nice.
[14789.24s -> 14789.48s]  All right.
[14789.48s -> 14790.68s]  Good work, everybody.
[14790.68s -> 14801.76s]  Get out of here.
[14801.76s -> 14804.61s]  Fenrir on the right.
[14804.61s -> 14806.44s]  Watch that.
[14806.44s -> 14807.24s]  Watch that Fenrir.
[14807.80s -> 14809.43s]  Oh, fuck.
[14809.43s -> 14816.04s]  Fenrir behind us.
[14816.60s -> 14820.61s]  Watch that Fenrir.
[14820.61s -> 14821.81s]  Fenrir is waving at us.
[14821.81s -> 14822.21s]  Watch out.
[14822.21s -> 14822.61s]  Watch out.
[14822.61s -> 14823.01s]  Watch out.
[14825.40s -> 14825.96s]  Oh, no.
[14826.68s -> 14839.41s]  Oh, my God.
[14839.41s -> 14840.45s]  We don't have a tower.
[14840.45s -> 14840.77s]  No way.
[14840.77s -> 14841.89s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14841.89s -> 14842.85s]  I thought we had a tower.
[14842.85s -> 14843.49s]  Oh, my God.
[14843.49s -> 14844.21s]  I'm so bad.
[14844.21s -> 14845.09s]  It's just I can't play.
[14845.81s -> 14847.91s]  I just can't play.
[14847.91s -> 14848.55s]  You know what I mean?
[14848.55s -> 14849.19s]  Like I just get...
[14849.19s -> 14850.47s]  I'm just in three different places.
[14850.47s -> 14852.55s]  My brain is like in three places.
[14852.55s -> 14854.79s]  It's like I'm looking at chat.
[14854.79s -> 14856.07s]  I'm thinking of the next thing to say.
[14856.07s -> 14857.27s]  And I'm playing Smite.
[14857.27s -> 14858.71s]  All those things have to be zero.
[14858.71s -> 14860.23s]  I have to only use my brain for Smite.
[14860.79s -> 14867.97s]  If we're ever working, don't talk to me.
[14867.97s -> 14869.17s]  If you ever want me to get anything done.
[14870.05s -> 14873.11s]  If you're one of those kind of co-workers
[14873.11s -> 14874.39s]  that would walk up to my desk,
[14875.19s -> 14876.77s]  just leave me alone.
[14878.13s -> 14918.42s]  You're almost an economy car that can only...
[14918.42s -> 14920.50s]  It saves money because it only goes on three cylinders.
[14921.14s -> 14922.92s]  No, I have a...
[14922.92s -> 14923.96s]  My car is awesome.
[14924.52s -> 14925.80s]  I have a really fast car,
[14927.88s -> 14931.72s]  but I can only operate one thing at a time.
[14932.60s -> 14943.24s]  Whoops, wrong button.
[14953.78s -> 14954.34s]  Kill it.
[14961.67s -> 14962.15s]  Kill it.
[14962.71s -> 14975.16s]  Don't let...
[14975.16s -> 14975.72s]  Don't...
[14975.72s -> 14976.60s]  It's not worth it.
[14976.60s -> 14983.04s]  Where's the auto attack guy?
[14983.04s -> 14983.60s]  Because you're right.
[15000.47s -> 15001.03s]  God damn it.
[15001.03s -> 15001.67s]  What was I thinking?
[15002.39s -> 15003.11s]  What was I thinking?
[15003.67s -> 15008.90s]  What was I thinking?
[15008.90s -> 15017.83s]  Why are they running after me still?
[15026.95s -> 15029.09s]  I'm not going in there.
[15031.72s -> 15032.12s]  Wait a minute.
[15032.12s -> 15032.44s]  Should we?
[15044.60s -> 15056.02s]  All right.
[15056.02s -> 15056.58s]  Be careful.
[15058.80s -> 15061.97s]  What's going on?
[15068.90s -> 15069.38s]  All right.
[15069.38s -> 15069.94s]  Okay.
[15069.94s -> 15070.34s]  All right.
[15070.34s -> 15070.74s]  This is it.
[15074.95s -> 15075.35s]  Okay.
[15075.35s -> 15075.75s]  All right.
[15079.06s -> 15080.26s]  What the fuck just happened?
[15104.44s -> 15105.32s]  That feeling...
[15105.32s -> 15106.76s]  That face when we could be playing Charlie
[15106.76s -> 15108.28s]  and the Chocolate Factor for PS2
[15108.28s -> 15110.20s]  and we're suffering instead in Smite.
[15112.95s -> 15114.71s]  I mean, my first like five or six...
[15115.43s -> 15117.11s]  I can't hear myself breathing.
[15119.01s -> 15120.61s]  The first like five games were fine.
[15120.61s -> 15121.49s]  I was doing pretty good.
[15122.95s -> 15124.15s]  Did I hit gamer fatigue?
[15141.70s -> 15143.46s]  The first like six games we played,
[15143.46s -> 15145.14s]  I was like 10 and four,
[15145.14s -> 15146.50s]  like 12 and six.
[15146.50s -> 15158.10s]  Is that actually...
[15158.10s -> 15159.14s]  Is that game any fun?
[15159.14s -> 15160.82s]  Should I play Charlie and the Chocolate Factor?
[15163.84s -> 15170.31s]  I do not want to be up here alone.
[15183.36s -> 15183.68s]  I'll go.
[15184.88s -> 15187.08s]  Were you queuing with randoms?
[15187.08s -> 15187.72s]  No, even the random...
[15187.72s -> 15188.76s]  Even the ones when we played with the...
[15189.40s -> 15189.96s]  Viewer games.
[15189.96s -> 15190.60s]  I was doing all right.
[15195.48s -> 15196.84s]  I have to get at least one kill here.
[15196.84s -> 15197.72s]  This is ridiculous.
[15197.72s -> 15198.36s]  Come on.
[15198.36s -> 15204.45s]  I look like the villain from Amnesia.
[15215.16s -> 15215.88s]  Oh shit.
[15215.88s -> 15216.12s]  Move.
[15224.08s -> 15224.88s]  Thanks, I guess.
[15235.28s -> 15235.52s]  All right.
[15235.52s -> 15237.04s]  We have the advantage now.
[15237.04s -> 15240.48s]  I believe we have pretty good advantage.
[15240.48s -> 15250.61s]  I want everyone to remember to keep in mind
[15250.61s -> 15251.81s]  that if you don't think you have any power
[15252.37s -> 15253.65s]  on this channel or in this community...
[15257.36s -> 15258.48s]  Remember, this stream only happened
[15258.48s -> 15260.16s]  because three people in freestream wanted to see it.
[15260.88s -> 15261.67s]  Remember that.
[15263.78s -> 15264.98s]  You don't think that you have power here.
[15280.37s -> 15283.30s]  You remind me of it.
[15283.30s -> 15283.94s]  Destiny 2.
[15283.94s -> 15284.98s]  I'm never going to play Destiny 2.
[15284.98s -> 15285.38s]  Put your feet.
[15285.38s -> 15286.18s]  Get out of here.
[15286.18s -> 15288.93s]  We actually won the game.
[15288.93s -> 15289.65s]  I got one kill.
[15289.65s -> 15289.97s]  All right.
[15289.97s -> 15290.29s]  I'm good.
[15290.29s -> 15293.94s]  Let me show you how it's done.
[15293.94s -> 15304.08s]  Remember, this stream sucks, Rufflecopter.
[15304.64s -> 15308.60s]  How dare you use like a 2007 meme in my channel?
[15310.50s -> 15311.78s]  How dare you?
[15312.42s -> 15320.05s]  All right.
[15320.05s -> 15320.93s]  Let's do another one.
[15320.93s -> 15321.48s]  All right.
[15321.48s -> 15323.33s]  We're going to do a comedy game this time.
[15323.33s -> 15324.21s]  This one's just for fun.
[15361.48s -> 15366.28s]  Password is...
[15366.28s -> 15366.76s]  I don't know.
[15366.76s -> 15370.37s]  I don't remember.
[15370.37s -> 15382.16s]  I actually don't.
[15382.16s -> 15386.84s]  Do a V2 in Conquest.
[15386.84s -> 15388.16s]  Random pick.
[15388.16s -> 15389.28s]  Everybody starts at level 20.
[15389.28s -> 15390.24s]  100,000 gold.
[15390.24s -> 15392.55s]  No pauses.
[15392.55s -> 15393.75s]  Welcome to Japan.
[15393.75s -> 15407.94s]  What's the password?
[15407.94s -> 15408.50s]  Nice.
[15408.50s -> 15410.40s]  Password is 1, 2, 3.
[15412.36s -> 15412.68s]  All right.
[15412.68s -> 15413.08s]  Here we go.
[15413.08s -> 15417.94s]  Let's go for it.
[15417.94s -> 15420.24s]  We got to stick together.
[15420.24s -> 15421.12s]  Very important.
[15421.12s -> 15429.97s]  At least we got a Bolano.
[15429.97s -> 15432.58s]  Kamazots?
[15433.22s -> 15433.94s]  He has a swoop.
[15433.94s -> 15434.42s]  I don't know.
[15434.42s -> 15434.90s]  I don't remember.
[15434.90s -> 15442.72s]  What does he do?
[15442.72s -> 15465.14s]  Isn't Kamazots actually like F tier?
[15465.14s -> 15466.02s]  Build lifesteal.
[15466.02s -> 15466.42s]  All right.
[15466.42s -> 15468.80s]  Just buy every lifesteal item.
[15468.80s -> 15477.70s]  I wonder how the ping is going to be.
[15477.70s -> 15488.21s]  All right.
[15488.21s -> 15489.41s]  We got to move quickly.
[15489.41s -> 15497.49s]  Lifesteal.
[15502.80s -> 15503.20s]  Okay.
[15503.20s -> 15503.60s]  I guess.
[15507.35s -> 15513.94s]  I don't know.
[15513.94s -> 15514.18s]  All right.
[15514.18s -> 15516.63s]  I don't know what the character does, but let's go.
[15516.63s -> 15516.87s]  Wait.
[15516.87s -> 15517.51s]  Potions.
[15517.51s -> 15522.21s]  Potions aren't going to do anything, are they?
[15522.21s -> 15522.45s]  Wards.
[15522.45s -> 15523.17s]  We need wards.
[15523.17s -> 15528.20s]  All right.
[15528.20s -> 15537.28s]  Let's go.
[15537.28s -> 15537.84s]  I'm thinking.
[15537.84s -> 15542.82s]  Honestly, I'm thinking we just dive the first tower.
[15542.82s -> 15543.54s]  Just really quickly.
[15543.54s -> 15546.18s]  Just dive the tower.
[15546.18s -> 15556.45s]  There's no way it's going to kill us.
[15556.45s -> 15557.17s]  Oh my god.
[15557.17s -> 15560.79s]  You're Freya.
[15560.79s -> 15561.03s]  All right.
[15561.03s -> 15561.91s]  Get in it, Bolano.
[15561.91s -> 15563.27s]  It caused some havoc.
[15563.27s -> 15564.55s]  It's Freya.
[15564.55s -> 15565.03s]  It's over.
[15566.15s -> 15567.19s]  Freya is so good.
[15568.18s -> 15568.90s]  Oh, man.
[15569.46s -> 15583.65s]  Freya activates her 1, her 2, and then just does the link to the past spam and just kills everybody.
[15583.65s -> 15585.25s]  Sell everything and buy defense.
[15585.25s -> 15586.37s]  I, should I?
[15588.08s -> 15589.68s]  Apollo and Freya late game.
[15589.68s -> 15593.09s]  Oh, it's over.
[15593.09s -> 15594.05s]  But this Bolona.
[15594.05s -> 15596.08s]  I got Bolona.
[15596.08s -> 15597.36s]  I need defense.
[15597.36s -> 15597.60s]  Okay.
[15597.60s -> 15598.40s]  We're going to.
[15598.40s -> 15601.11s]  Physical defense.
[15601.75s -> 15607.76s]  Physical defense.
[15609.99s -> 15632.40s]  Magic defense.
[15632.40s -> 15632.96s]  You good?
[15632.96s -> 15633.60s]  Let's go.
[15633.60s -> 15640.44s]  I ate that ult.
[15640.44s -> 15640.76s]  Let's go.
[15650.26s -> 15651.94s]  Oh, this is bad.
[15651.94s -> 15661.65s]  That's not going to work.
[15662.29s -> 15669.89s]  Power.
[15669.89s -> 15670.93s]  Power, power, power, power, power.
[15672.20s -> 15672.60s]  Power.
[15672.60s -> 15673.64s]  Whatever power is, I don't care.
[15674.20s -> 15675.70s]  Lifesteal.
[15678.76s -> 15679.96s]  I don't, I don't know what any of these do.
[15679.96s -> 15680.84s]  Whatever.
[15680.84s -> 15682.55s]  What's that super potion?
[15692.98s -> 15693.78s]  Am I still dead?
[15698.16s -> 15705.99s]  What?
[15705.99s -> 15707.19s]  They could have just won the game.
[15707.19s -> 15719.16s]  How are we going to do this?
[15719.16s -> 15725.75s]  I think we just ignore them and we just pick a lane that they're not in and try to just beat the game before they do.
[15725.75s -> 15731.08s]  You know what I'm saying?
[15731.08s -> 15736.47s]  2v2 on Conquest.
[15736.47s -> 15737.03s]  I don't know the game.
[15737.03s -> 15737.99s]  Something bugged out.
[15737.99s -> 15742.71s]  I queued up with my buddy here and I don't know.
[15742.71s -> 15743.27s]  Something weird happened.
[15743.27s -> 15753.80s]  Like, it just put us in a game.
[15753.80s -> 15754.12s]  All right.
[15754.12s -> 15755.72s]  Just get in here and tank this.
[15755.72s -> 15768.34s]  Where are they?
[15768.34s -> 15772.58s]  Are they just, are they looking at items?
[15775.76s -> 15776.24s]  Why, what?
[15776.24s -> 15777.04s]  He stealthed?
[15778.74s -> 15779.46s]  What the fuck?
[15781.28s -> 15782.24s]  Where were they?
[15782.24s -> 15783.04s]  What the hell happened?
[15783.04s -> 15784.32s]  Were they hiding behind the tower?
[15788.74s -> 15790.26s]  I'm very confused.
[15790.26s -> 15791.78s]  What just happened?
[15792.34s -> 15802.12s]  Paulo goes into the sky.
[15802.76s -> 15809.52s]  Yeah, but doesn't he?
[15809.52s -> 15813.44s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[15813.44s -> 15815.12s]  But I don't, Freya was right there too.
[15815.12s -> 15816.24s]  Where did Freya come from?
[15816.24s -> 15819.22s]  I think it's going to keep the game open.
[15819.22s -> 15830.96s]  This is so eerie.
[15830.96s -> 15838.05s]  This is, something about this is just not right, right?
[15838.05s -> 15849.80s]  Well, there's no way we're going to be able to kill them.
[15849.80s -> 15853.08s]  Two late game characters that all they do is massive amounts of damage.
[15853.80s -> 15854.68s]  What am I going to do?
[15854.68s -> 15856.90s]  Jump on somebody's back and bite them?
[15856.90s -> 15862.15s]  Like, can I just see, Freya?
[15862.15s -> 15863.59s]  Can I just see something real quick?
[15863.59s -> 15865.11s]  Let me see something real quick.
[15865.11s -> 15865.99s]  Just real quick.
[15865.99s -> 15866.71s]  No, no, real quick.
[15866.71s -> 15868.15s]  I'm supposed to see something real quick.
[15868.15s -> 15869.19s]  Real quick, just real quick.
[15870.15s -> 15873.48s]  Okay, let me see.
[15873.48s -> 15874.76s]  Can I even hurt you?
[15874.76s -> 15878.02s]  Oh shit, I can hurt you.
[15878.58s -> 15880.72s]  That's so crazy.
[15880.72s -> 15881.68s]  Hold on, let me just one more thing.
[15882.48s -> 15883.91s]  Kill them both, kill them both, kill them both.
[15883.91s -> 15885.19s]  Quick, quick, quick, kill them both.
[15885.19s -> 15885.83s]  Go, go, go.
[15886.71s -> 15898.02s]  Yep, that's the one, that's the one.
[15898.02s -> 15910.72s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[15910.72s -> 15911.36s]  No honor?
[15912.64s -> 15914.36s]  You fight without honor.
[15916.24s -> 15918.50s]  You fight without honor.
[15918.50s -> 15920.42s]  Yeah, oh, but he did.
[15921.06s -> 15937.88s]  Kill it quick.
[15938.44s -> 15940.40s]  Oh shit.
[15996.77s -> 16001.36s]  Hey, um, hey, wait, wait, wait a second.
[16001.36s -> 16002.16s]  Wait a second.
[16002.16s -> 16005.11s]  The Bologna's, uh, lagging.
[16005.11s -> 16007.35s]  Bologna's mom was, uh, calling him.
[16007.35s -> 16009.89s]  Bologna's mom was calling.
[16009.89s -> 16011.78s]  Oh, we can go in, actually.
[16011.78s -> 16012.90s]  Go, go, go, fuck the jokes.
[16013.62s -> 16025.88s]  This is it, we win.
[16025.88s -> 16029.54s]  We just have to end the game.
[16029.54s -> 16035.56s]  I got this sick Bologna on my team.
[16035.56s -> 16042.08s]  Thank God.
[16042.08s -> 16045.01s]  Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[16045.01s -> 16053.99s]  I'm wrapping around.
[16053.99s -> 16055.67s]  Oh no, she's so strong.
[16055.67s -> 16069.70s]  She's so strong.
[16069.70s -> 16070.50s]  She's so strong.
[16071.30s -> 16074.24s]  She just kills both of us in three hits.
[16074.24s -> 16074.72s]  Not even.
[16074.72s -> 16115.91s]  What the fuck just happened?
[16115.91s -> 16118.72s]  What?
[16118.72s -> 16120.32s]  No, no, this is not fair now.
[16120.32s -> 16125.78s]  DC?
[16125.78s -> 16127.06s]  No, that's not cool.
[16127.06s -> 16135.06s]  That was a DC.
[16135.06s -> 16136.02s]  Yeah, no, there's a DC.
[16136.02s -> 16136.90s]  There's a DC.
[16136.90s -> 16138.10s]  We can, no, no, you can't.
[16138.10s -> 16138.98s]  That's not fair.
[16138.98s -> 16141.80s]  If I had somebody else here, this would be much easier.
[16151.96s -> 16159.94s]  I'm down a player.
[16159.94s -> 16160.74s]  Oh man.
[16161.46s -> 16171.60s]  If only you were still here, you'd be able to run and finish the game.
[16171.60s -> 16174.48s]  What we should have done is you should have just stayed in the
[16174.56s -> 16176.88s]  fountain, pretended to DC.
[16176.88s -> 16179.28s]  They wouldn't have even attacked you.
[16179.28s -> 16181.44s]  Then you could have just walked down the lane right now.
[16181.44s -> 16183.88s]  Can you come back?
[16183.88s -> 16192.37s]  If you log into the game right now and just walk.
[16192.37s -> 16193.33s]  Oh man.
[16193.33s -> 16213.92s]  I'm done with this one.
[16213.92s -> 16214.64s]  That was fun.
[16214.64s -> 16215.76s]  Thank you for playing.
[16215.76s -> 16230.12s]  All right, now we're going to do a regular arena and then I'm probably going to stop.
[16232.52s -> 16233.80s]  We'll do like one or two more.
[16233.80s -> 16237.32s]  It's been a lot of fun though.
[16237.32s -> 16238.76s]  Hey, you know what?
[16238.76s -> 16245.03s]  This is actually, it's been a very long time since I've done anything like viewer game related.
[16245.03s -> 16248.08s]  We haven't done this in probably two or three years at least.
[16248.40s -> 16250.32s]  It's fun to play with you guys, it is.
[16252.21s -> 16255.73s]  Even if half of these games are just comedy games, right?
[16259.24s -> 16260.20s]  Let's do arena.
[16260.20s -> 16273.46s]  For a Japanese server, that actually ran very well.
[16273.46s -> 16274.34s]  That was weird.
[16274.34s -> 16282.40s]  All right.
[16282.40s -> 16283.04s]  Good password.
[16283.04s -> 16283.76s]  Let's see.
[16283.76s -> 16293.35s]  I can't wait for next week's my Thursday.
[16293.35s -> 16294.47s]  This is never happening ever again.
[16296.10s -> 16296.42s]  Maybe.
[16297.94s -> 16298.42s]  All right.
[16298.42s -> 16307.65s]  Here we are.
[16307.65s -> 16308.85s]  Everything looks good.
[16308.85s -> 16315.67s]  Password is an emote on Twitch.
[16315.67s -> 16327.06s]  More specifically, an emote on better Twitch TV.
[16327.06s -> 16328.90s]  But there are no capitals.
[16328.90s -> 16332.34s]  It's just the word.
[16332.34s -> 16339.64s]  All right.
[16340.28s -> 16341.96s]  Password is Pippo Happy.
[16341.96s -> 16349.20s]  Very cool.
[16349.20s -> 16362.85s]  Very good.
[16362.85s -> 16365.73s]  Very good.
[16365.73s -> 16366.85s]  I want to play.
[16366.85s -> 16372.10s]  That's like, I don't know, Zeus maybe?
[16372.10s -> 16375.25s]  Don't quit.
[16375.25s -> 16375.49s]  Yeah.
[16375.49s -> 16376.37s]  Don't quit.
[16376.37s -> 16376.85s]  Don't quit.
[16376.85s -> 16377.65s]  It's cool.
[16377.65s -> 16379.49s]  Although I don't know for arena though.
[16379.49s -> 16381.73s]  Probably bad because you need to fill the bag with minions.
[16381.73s -> 16382.85s]  Nah, probably not good for arena.
[16387.83s -> 16392.31s]  I kind of need a guardian.
[16392.95s -> 16398.87s]  All right.
[16398.87s -> 16399.83s]  I'm going to be a guardian.
[16399.83s -> 16400.31s]  I will be...
[16400.95s -> 16406.32s]  Oh, Ares.
[16406.32s -> 16406.96s]  We already have a...
[16407.92s -> 16411.44s]  I'm so sorry.
[16411.44s -> 16419.64s]  The person even selected guardian.
[16420.20s -> 16431.19s]  Looks like we're going damage Ares.
[16431.19s -> 16431.75s]  Yep.
[16431.75s -> 16450.93s]  Let's get a victory royale.
[16450.93s -> 16454.21s]  Let's try.
[16454.77s -> 16457.41s]  That's a crazy skin.
[16457.41s -> 16462.12s]  All right.
[16462.12s -> 16463.48s]  I'm just going to build magic damage.
[16463.48s -> 16465.27s]  See if I can get some kills.
[16465.27s -> 16470.76s]  Where's my eyes?
[16470.76s -> 16484.68s]  So the next stream is going to be...
[16484.68s -> 16486.02s]  I'm trying to keep...
[16486.66s -> 16488.34s]  I'm not sure if you guys have noticed.
[16488.34s -> 16490.72s]  I'm trying to do two days a week.
[16490.72s -> 16492.13s]  Instead of just once a week.
[16493.36s -> 16496.24s]  Once a week, Andy is officially probably over.
[16496.24s -> 16498.71s]  We are now twice a week, Andy.
[16498.71s -> 16503.17s]  Nice to meet you too.
[16504.29s -> 16505.27s]  All right.
[16505.27s -> 16505.83s]  What are they?
[16505.83s -> 16506.47s]  Voidstone?
[16508.90s -> 16509.94s]  Yeah, let's do Voidstone.
[16510.82s -> 16518.61s]  So whether that's Saturday, Sunday usually.
[16520.10s -> 16522.61s]  Or randomly during the week.
[16522.93s -> 16534.07s]  I'm trying to get back to two days a week.
[16534.07s -> 16538.15s]  I don't foresee a period where we ever will get back to three or four days a week.
[16538.95s -> 16541.03s]  But two is absolutely fine.
[16541.03s -> 16543.75s]  I think I'm very capable at this point to do it.
[16548.98s -> 16551.14s]  And the idea is that those will be on the weekend.
[16551.14s -> 16555.43s]  But as sometimes, you know, sometimes those plans change.
[16557.48s -> 16560.52s]  Current plan now is to stream probably on Monday or Tuesday from now.
[16561.16s -> 16566.72s]  Oh, shit.
[16566.72s -> 16567.12s]  Already?
[16569.16s -> 16569.40s]  All right.
[16569.40s -> 16569.80s]  Let's do it.
[16570.44s -> 16578.84s]  We all did the same exact move.
[16579.48s -> 16585.67s]  How did that miss?
[16585.67s -> 16585.91s]  Really?
[16595.99s -> 16596.23s]  All right.
[16596.23s -> 16597.27s]  I need to get blink.
[16597.27s -> 16598.15s]  It's really important.
[16603.20s -> 16603.60s]  Get him.
[16605.44s -> 16610.31s]  Oh, I'm stuck.
[16614.08s -> 16614.72s]  I killed somebody.
[16614.72s -> 16615.20s]  Who did I kill?
[16615.76s -> 16625.27s]  Magical power, physical protection.
[16625.27s -> 16631.65s]  Yeah, Andy, I can't get it yet.
[16631.65s -> 16633.44s]  I'll get that'll be the next thing I get, though.
[16633.44s -> 16633.92s]  For sure.
[16634.72s -> 16646.36s]  What are these little things?
[16646.36s -> 16665.00s]  What am I going to play after this?
[16667.01s -> 16668.53s]  I don't know what the next thing I'll do is.
[16669.17s -> 16670.52s]  There are a bunch of options.
[16670.52s -> 16670.92s]  We'll see.
[16675.78s -> 16677.70s]  Oh, I thought you're going to walk backwards.
[16680.64s -> 16681.12s]  This is bad.
[16682.93s -> 16683.17s]  No.
[16693.00s -> 16694.04s]  So mad at that guy.
[16695.54s -> 16697.30s]  I'm infuriated at that guy.
[16707.73s -> 16708.45s]  They all get beads.
[16708.45s -> 16709.01s]  They probably did.
[16713.73s -> 16714.53s]  Outer Wilds.
[16714.53s -> 16725.54s]  No, I don't think so.
[16725.54s -> 16726.10s]  GTA.
[16726.10s -> 16728.63s]  You know what?
[16728.63s -> 16730.87s]  I cannot hit this shit to save my life right now.
[16732.31s -> 16733.35s]  Maybe I will play GTA.
[16735.01s -> 16736.13s]  That sounds actually like a lot of fun.
[16737.62s -> 16737.86s]  All right.
[16737.86s -> 16738.98s]  We're going to do GTA next, I think.
[16749.91s -> 16750.79s]  Kill somebody.
[16751.35s -> 16754.18s]  Oh, that's annoying.
[16768.16s -> 16769.12s]  Grand Theft Andy.
[16769.68s -> 16770.95s]  It seems like it might be fun.
[16772.93s -> 16773.57s]  Which one do I want?
[16773.57s -> 16774.29s]  I wanted this one.
[16774.29s -> 16780.34s]  This one here.
[16780.34s -> 16781.62s]  No, not GTA RP.
[16781.62s -> 16783.30s]  I would just play regular GTA online.
[16784.02s -> 16785.38s]  Do like the casino update or something.
[16786.80s -> 16788.08s]  Just it would just be mayhem.
[16810.95s -> 16812.47s]  Play the steam games.
[16812.47s -> 16813.99s]  That's oh, yeah, I could do that too.
[16813.99s -> 16815.81s]  That's absolutely what we could do.
[16828.95s -> 16829.19s]  No.
[16840.80s -> 16847.48s]  What about no umbrellas allowed?
[16847.48s -> 16848.28s]  That's another one too.
[16854.00s -> 16854.64s]  There's options.
[16863.92s -> 16875.57s]  You cannot run from a reach.
[16875.57s -> 16877.57s]  Oh, that was a good one.
[16878.21s -> 16881.56s]  All right.
[16881.56s -> 16882.04s]  Can we do this?
[16882.04s -> 16882.68s]  Can we pull it back?
[16885.03s -> 16885.27s]  Yeah.
[16886.07s -> 16887.03s]  M Dicky Knights.
[16887.03s -> 16887.75s]  Absolutely.
[16887.75s -> 16889.27s]  Yeah, we got plenty of stuff to do.
[16901.73s -> 16902.69s]  Oh, this is where I die.
[16906.32s -> 16906.88s]  There we go.
[16909.12s -> 16909.36s]  Blink.
[16910.32s -> 16911.04s]  This is the good shit.
[16918.88s -> 16922.08s]  You do blink, hit four, and immediately run away.
[16922.08s -> 16928.76s]  What about Community Content Knights?
[16928.76s -> 16934.36s]  Community Content Knights can never return due to the DMCA stuff.
[16934.36s -> 16939.99s]  Those of you that remember those fondly,
[16941.83s -> 16946.07s]  we've watched almost entire uninterrupted scenes of Star Wars.
[16946.71s -> 16947.91s]  We cannot do that anymore.
[16948.47s -> 16953.32s]  I didn't get it.
[16953.32s -> 16954.96s]  All right.
[16954.96s -> 16955.36s]  Here we go.
[16955.36s -> 16956.00s]  Are you ready?
[16956.00s -> 16956.32s]  Ready?
[16956.32s -> 16956.64s]  Ready?
[16956.64s -> 16956.96s]  Ready?
[16956.96s -> 16957.28s]  Watch this.
[16957.28s -> 16957.60s]  Watch this.
[16957.60s -> 16957.92s]  Watch this.
[16957.92s -> 16958.24s]  Ready?
[16958.24s -> 16958.56s]  Ready?
[16958.56s -> 16958.88s]  Ready?
[16958.88s -> 16959.20s]  Ready?
[16961.16s -> 16962.36s]  Oh, it's a cooldown.
[16962.36s -> 16963.24s]  What happened?
[16963.24s -> 16964.44s]  What is wrong with you?
[16965.08s -> 16966.12s]  What's wrong with you?
[16966.84s -> 16968.04s]  What is wrong with you?
[16968.84s -> 16972.02s]  What's wrong with you?
[16972.02s -> 16973.30s]  I just can't pay attention to anything.
[16978.76s -> 16979.64s]  Geez, man.
[16979.64s -> 16981.88s]  I literally can't pay attention to anything.
[16981.88s -> 16994.92s]  I got it this time.
[17010.77s -> 17011.25s]  Kill him.
[17011.81s -> 17019.52s]  Oh, my God.
[17019.52s -> 17020.40s]  I didn't mean to press that.
[17021.12s -> 17031.81s]  Too much damage.
[17037.36s -> 17040.07s]  Oh, Thor.
[17040.07s -> 17040.47s]  Thank you.
[17046.28s -> 17056.72s]  Are you going to do anything for Halloween?
[17058.63s -> 17059.91s]  I'm actually not sure.
[17059.91s -> 17060.63s]  That's a good question.
[17064.64s -> 17066.16s]  I mean, I could do VR stuff again,
[17066.16s -> 17068.40s]  but I feel like I've done that the last couple of years.
[17073.75s -> 17074.63s]  Just do horror games.
[17074.63s -> 17075.35s]  Yeah, that's easy.
[17076.42s -> 17078.18s]  Should be fun and simple enough, right?
[17078.18s -> 17079.62s]  Maybe I'll wear a costume or something.
[17091.59s -> 17092.63s]  Oh, I didn't.
[17092.63s -> 17093.99s]  I did not do that at a good time.
[17094.71s -> 17097.56s]  What about public domain movie night?
[17099.56s -> 17101.64s]  There needs to be enough public domain movies for me to care about.
[17113.73s -> 17114.37s]  Free Stooges?
[17114.37s -> 17116.05s]  I don't think the Free Stooges is a public domain.
[17117.01s -> 17117.73s]  Didn't we look that up?
[17118.45s -> 17122.40s]  But yes, absolutely.
[17122.40s -> 17123.04s]  I would love to.
[17123.04s -> 17125.12s]  If we can get a good and I don't want.
[17125.12s -> 17126.48s]  OK, here's let me rephrase that.
[17128.15s -> 17132.15s]  I want to watch old movies from like the 40s, like 50s.
[17134.50s -> 17136.74s]  I don't just because a movie's public domain.
[17136.74s -> 17139.22s]  I mean, if it came out in like 2018 or something,
[17139.22s -> 17140.66s]  I don't I want to watch the old shit.
[17150.40s -> 17151.92s]  We're losing very badly.
[17152.48s -> 17152.96s]  How though?
[17158.28s -> 17159.48s]  Nosferatu?
[17159.48s -> 17161.81s]  Let's compile a list.
[17161.81s -> 17162.13s]  I'll do that.
[17162.13s -> 17163.09s]  Maybe we'll do that for Halloween.
[17164.72s -> 17168.68s]  Yeah, either the night before or the night.
[17169.80s -> 17172.28s]  At some point, a day or so before Halloween, we'll do that.
[17172.28s -> 17180.47s]  It sounds like a fun Halloween stream.
[17181.19s -> 17186.80s]  No.
[17187.68s -> 17188.24s]  Oh, boy.
[17188.24s -> 17189.28s]  I just walked into everybody.
[17190.45s -> 17190.85s]  Oh, boy.
[17190.85s -> 17191.97s]  I'm just barely paying attention.
[17191.97s -> 17192.77s]  I got to stop this.
[17193.41s -> 17198.52s]  Why am I playing this game like it's a fucking clicker?
[17199.68s -> 17202.48s]  Like, oh, yeah, just like the glance over at it every now and then.
[17203.36s -> 17205.84s]  How many grandmas do I have cooking in the bakeries?
[17205.84s -> 17206.64s]  I don't know.
[17206.64s -> 17213.80s]  Physical power and magical power.
[17213.80s -> 17214.04s]  What?
[17223.35s -> 17224.87s]  OK, this is not over yet.
[17225.59s -> 17237.17s]  We get anybody?
[17245.09s -> 17245.97s]  Holy shit.
[17248.42s -> 17257.03s]  I think we're going to lose.
[17257.67s -> 17261.81s]  If I were to take a wild guess, I would say we're going to lose the game.
[17267.24s -> 17269.80s]  I've never seen triple life steal Aerie.
[17270.61s -> 17272.29s]  Well, come on.
[17272.93s -> 17274.05s]  Give it a try one day.
[17274.05s -> 17275.25s]  Maybe it'll work out for you.
[17282.15s -> 17284.15s]  You see that, you know, the funniest part about that.
[17285.03s -> 17287.03s]  I didn't even know that's what I was doing.
[17287.03s -> 17287.43s]  You did.
[17288.58s -> 17291.83s]  I didn't even know that's what I was doing until I just looked at it.
[17292.39s -> 17306.96s]  What are you going to eat after the stream?
[17306.96s -> 17308.32s]  Oh, probably tacos.
[17308.88s -> 17316.26s]  That sounds good, right?
[17318.02s -> 17319.06s]  How did that miss?
[17319.06s -> 17320.58s]  It went between the two of them.
[17321.30s -> 17328.74s]  I don't know what's going on.
[17328.74s -> 17338.16s]  I mean, this is a game for nerds.
[17338.72s -> 17341.38s]  I'll make sure I'll never play it again.
[17341.38s -> 17341.78s]  You're right.
[17342.42s -> 17345.03s]  I'll make sure I'll never play this again.
[17345.03s -> 17345.75s]  I didn't know that.
[17345.75s -> 17349.25s]  What is the way that nerds play this game?
[17350.07s -> 17351.35s]  Oh, I'm never playing it.
[17351.35s -> 17352.07s]  Are you kidding me?
[17354.47s -> 17355.59s]  Yeah, no, fuck that.
[17355.59s -> 17356.55s]  Never playing this again.
[17358.45s -> 17359.65s]  I did not know that.
[17359.65s -> 17361.97s]  So let me just make sure I make that clear.
[17361.97s -> 17368.28s]  How come there's not a nice costume?
[17371.99s -> 17373.27s]  All right, what do you say? One more?
[17373.27s -> 17375.03s]  Yeah, let's do one more.
[17375.03s -> 17387.64s]  We'll do, uh, assault.
[17387.64s -> 17391.30s]  Those are the most fun.
[17398.95s -> 17399.35s]  Good.
[17399.35s -> 17399.67s]  All right.
[17399.67s -> 17400.23s]  Off.
[17400.23s -> 17401.19s]  And password.
[17401.99s -> 17423.28s]  Password is a related to somebody in space, a movie that takes place in space.
[17423.28s -> 17433.89s]  A series of movies that take place in space.
[17433.89s -> 17441.80s]  This is a character from that series.
[17441.80s -> 17445.43s]  They're in no spaces.
[17445.43s -> 17450.12s]  Password was Darth Vader.
[17450.12s -> 17451.08s]  No spaces.
[17451.08s -> 17469.08s]  I don't want to play this character.
[17469.08s -> 17470.12s]  I don't know how this character plays.
[17471.00s -> 17472.04s]  Thank you so much.
[17472.12s -> 17474.36s]  You literally just saved the last game of the stream.
[17474.36s -> 17488.02s]  How many people are still watching?
[17488.02s -> 17492.56s]  There's actually a very fair amount of people still here.
[17492.56s -> 17494.56s]  I'm actually very surprised about that.
[17494.56s -> 17501.36s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[17501.36s -> 17505.36s]  Just playing some Smite, just messing around.
[17505.36s -> 17506.56s]  It's not a big deal.
[17506.56s -> 17520.58s]  Sometimes you have to remember what a video game looks like.
[17520.58s -> 17530.24s]  Smite 2015.
[17530.24s -> 17530.64s]  What is that?
[17533.64s -> 17534.60s]  Let us bet on this one?
[17535.24s -> 17535.48s]  Sure.
[17537.36s -> 17538.76s]  Open it up.
[17538.76s -> 17540.12s]  Does my team win this game?
[17548.21s -> 17552.15s]  Seems like we have, we're up against a legendary Belona,
[17552.15s -> 17555.14s]  but we do have two level.
[17556.02s -> 17556.98s]  I don't know what that number that was.
[17564.34s -> 17564.90s]  Cool down.
[17564.90s -> 17565.62s]  Absolutely.
[17571.67s -> 17573.35s]  And of course, Aegis.
[17573.35s -> 17574.71s]  It's just the guaranteed pick.
[17574.71s -> 17575.19s]  Let's go.
[17578.40s -> 17579.04s]  We're going to win.
[17589.25s -> 17590.69s]  Don't let us down all in on me.
[17594.00s -> 17594.80s]  I wouldn't do that.
[17600.48s -> 17601.12s]  Where are they?
[17601.12s -> 17601.60s]  Oh my God.
[17604.24s -> 17605.28s]  They're hiding over here.
[17606.00s -> 17606.72s]  Aren't they?
[17607.36s -> 17611.78s]  Where's the other team?
[17612.42s -> 17623.40s]  Nice try.
[17624.80s -> 17633.81s]  Where is everybody?
[17633.81s -> 17636.05s]  Didn't that go much further than it?
[17636.05s -> 17636.61s]  That was weird.
[17643.01s -> 17643.41s]  Uh oh.
[17651.83s -> 17654.23s]  I know the fucking tactics with Kulkulkan.
[17654.79s -> 17655.51s]  Don't think I don't.
[17682.32s -> 17685.43s]  I do remember when Kulkulkan was out, Kwong.
[17685.43s -> 17686.71s]  That's very old.
[17686.71s -> 17695.08s]  Get away from me.
[17695.08s -> 17695.32s]  What?
[17695.32s -> 17695.72s]  Retreat.
[17696.36s -> 17702.00s]  Jerma, look over here.
[17702.00s -> 17702.64s]  Look over here.
[17702.64s -> 17703.60s]  Leave me alone.
[17703.60s -> 17705.24s]  I don't want to look.
[17705.24s -> 17716.58s]  I thought the Sobek was going to go get that.
[17716.58s -> 17717.30s]  Hey, watch this.
[17730.68s -> 17731.32s]  We doing this?
[17744.37s -> 17744.85s]  Get.
[17744.85s -> 17756.52s]  Watch out.
[17756.52s -> 17757.32s]  Need that cool down.
[17757.32s -> 17759.24s]  The thing is, it takes so long to get that back.
[17759.24s -> 17766.74s]  Jerma, look behind you.
[17771.30s -> 17771.54s]  Yeah.
[17772.66s -> 17773.30s]  Yeah.
[17773.30s -> 17778.77s]  Be heck up.
[17778.77s -> 17779.73s]  Just cool down in mana.
[17779.73s -> 17784.04s]  That's all you do with Kulkulkan.
[17784.04s -> 17795.48s]  Get in the chopper.
[17795.48s -> 17796.12s]  Hey.
[17796.12s -> 17805.73s]  Oh, we're going to all pog mana heal.
[17805.73s -> 17807.70s]  Nice job.
[17807.70s -> 17819.68s]  Make it so the lane minions hit that.
[17819.68s -> 17825.84s]  Did that not hit the Sobek?
[17825.84s -> 17827.04s]  Oh, come on, Gwyn.
[17827.04s -> 17827.68s]  Give me a break.
[17828.24s -> 17830.26s]  That's going to get...
[17830.26s -> 17831.62s]  I'm going to get two kills there.
[17831.62s -> 17833.44s]  At least one.
[17833.44s -> 17849.92s]  All right.
[17849.92s -> 17850.32s]  Let's go.
[17851.12s -> 17852.72s]  Jerma of Isolation is amazing as well.
[17853.44s -> 17855.78s]  Especially on Kulkulkan.
[17856.34s -> 17863.73s]  Who's left?
[17863.73s -> 17864.21s]  Just the set.
[17866.90s -> 17869.14s]  I'm so glad that I traded the soul with that guy.
[17869.70s -> 17882.90s]  With the sniper rifle.
[17882.90s -> 17884.58s]  I'm not playing Neith.
[17885.14s -> 17897.51s]  Get that shit out of here.
[17898.07s -> 17909.38s]  Those little firework things are such a distraction.
[17909.38s -> 17919.08s]  Ooh.
[17932.32s -> 17950.88s]  Oh, shit.
[17950.88s -> 17954.61s]  Ooh.
[17954.61s -> 17956.13s]  Where the fuck did you come from?
[17956.13s -> 17956.37s]  What?
[17957.94s -> 17958.74s]  Why does the person keep...
[17958.74s -> 17959.86s]  Why can they just do that?
[17959.86s -> 17960.58s]  What?
[17960.58s -> 17964.58s]  Where did the person even come from?
[17969.17s -> 17970.45s]  Was that Belona?
[17970.45s -> 17971.97s]  He walked right by me.
[17971.97s -> 17977.65s]  Did he blink?
[17977.65s -> 17991.00s]  How did I not see him?
[17991.00s -> 17992.48s]  I don't know.
[17992.48s -> 17995.27s]  This game takes a shitload of brain power.
[17995.27s -> 17996.95s]  I don't have any right now.
[18001.24s -> 18002.76s]  You have to understand something.
[18002.76s -> 18004.68s]  When you cross 30 years old,
[18004.76s -> 18007.64s]  your brain slows down every year till you get to 80.
[18009.32s -> 18016.48s]  My brain has declined since I was like 25.
[18016.48s -> 18017.04s]  It's real.
[18020.82s -> 18026.56s]  I'm closer to 40 than I am 25.
[18026.56s -> 18029.54s]  I'm closer to 40 than I am 30.
[18029.54s -> 18032.66s]  I'm playing incredibly well for a fucking 40-year-old.
[18032.66s -> 18033.30s]  Check that out.
[18053.16s -> 18055.24s]  Kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him.
[18055.24s -> 18055.74s]  Oh.
[18066.88s -> 18076.18s]  Damn it.
[18076.18s -> 18077.06s]  He's so close.
[18085.83s -> 18086.39s]  How old are you?
[18086.39s -> 18087.43s]  I'm 36.
[18087.43s -> 18089.83s]  I thought that was common knowledge.
[18089.83s -> 18097.24s]  Goodbye.
[18097.24s -> 18108.04s]  He just said you were 40.
[18108.04s -> 18110.60s]  Now I said I was closer to 40 than I am 40.
[18110.60s -> 18121.04s]  Stop.
[18121.04s -> 18122.24s]  Don't let him get away.
[18130.37s -> 18131.49s]  You age pretty well.
[18131.49s -> 18132.85s]  I feel like I have aged pretty well.
[18141.14s -> 18142.42s]  I think I'm aging pretty gracefully.
[18142.98s -> 18148.44s]  You could use that.
[18149.08s -> 18150.12s]  You're going to give it...
[18150.12s -> 18151.00s]  Did you try to steal it?
[18151.00s -> 18151.72s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[18151.72s -> 18152.28s]  I see.
[18152.28s -> 18168.32s]  Remember, stop talking about how old you are.
[18168.32s -> 18169.36s]  It makes me feel old.
[18172.00s -> 18172.96s]  Oh, he's...
[18172.96s -> 18184.45s]  It's way too late as top 10 videos of streamers you used to watch.
[18184.45s -> 18187.30s]  It's like, you feel old yet?
[18187.30s -> 18188.96s]  Number nine.
[18188.96s -> 18190.58s]  German985.
[18190.58s -> 18193.06s]  And it's a picture of me from, like, paparazzi getting out of the car.
[18193.06s -> 18196.34s]  And I have a bald head, gray hair, like, big bottle glasses.
[18199.04s -> 18199.76s]  Oh, my God.
[18199.76s -> 18200.64s]  This is what happens when I talk.
[18201.28s -> 18208.29s]  It's to hit somebody.
[18215.62s -> 18216.58s]  Yeah, I think.
[18216.58s -> 18222.93s]  This is very even.
[18222.93s -> 18243.49s]  20 years...
[18243.49s -> 18244.21s]  Number four.
[18244.21s -> 18245.09s]  The sus guy.
[18247.30s -> 18252.36s]  I don't think Among Us is going to make it another 20 years,
[18252.36s -> 18254.44s]  keeping the same popularity it has now.
[18254.44s -> 18256.44s]  But I would love to be corrected.
[18257.08s -> 18275.09s]  It's not even popular anymore now.
[18275.81s -> 18276.45s]  It still is.
[18278.34s -> 18279.06s]  You can gauge that...
[18279.86s -> 18280.26s]  All right.
[18280.26s -> 18281.62s]  Before you say that.
[18281.62s -> 18282.34s]  Oh, God.
[18283.14s -> 18283.64s]  No!
[18285.96s -> 18286.76s]  I have to...
[18296.34s -> 18296.90s]  Well, let me make...
[18296.90s -> 18300.12s]  Let me now make the point.
[18300.12s -> 18302.92s]  You have to judge that based on how many Halloween costumes you see this year.
[18309.28s -> 18312.16s]  If you see, personally, you walking around,
[18312.72s -> 18317.86s]  more than five Among Us character inflatable costumes,
[18318.66s -> 18320.58s]  it's still as popular as it was.
[18338.68s -> 18346.50s]  Gonna be squid game.
[18346.50s -> 18348.90s]  Yeah, it's gonna be squid game.
[18348.90s -> 18351.25s]  It's gonna be Among Us.
[18352.52s -> 18356.68s]  And a bunch of really in-character Dark Knight jokers.
[18356.68s -> 18358.04s]  That's every Halloween party.
[18358.04s -> 18377.62s]  What about sexy Among Us?
[18378.18s -> 18381.80s]  What do you mean?
[18381.80s -> 18398.85s]  Win the game?
[18398.85s -> 18399.81s]  I think we're in a pretty...
[18399.81s -> 18400.05s]  All right.
[18400.05s -> 18402.29s]  If I pay attention, maybe we'll do it.
[18402.29s -> 18413.04s]  I was gonna do it, but now it's not necessary.
[18413.04s -> 18416.23s]  I think...
[18416.23s -> 18417.09s]  How are you still...
[18417.09s -> 18418.13s]  The person's alive still.
[18422.68s -> 18423.18s]  Uh-oh.
[18427.76s -> 18443.91s]  Enemy has left the game.
[18443.91s -> 18444.41s]  Watch it.
[18460.24s -> 18464.29s]  Nice.
[18464.29s -> 18465.73s]  R.I.P. doubters.
[18465.73s -> 18467.52s]  Don't say that yet.
[18467.52s -> 18469.52s]  I've seen plenty of assault games where it's 4v5,
[18469.52s -> 18470.64s]  and the other team gets destroyed.
[18476.40s -> 18476.90s]  Get!
[18491.06s -> 18497.04s]  It's not over yet.
[18497.04s -> 18497.92s]  Not yet.
[18497.92s -> 18506.98s]  Now it actually might be over.
[18509.44s -> 18510.00s]  Very possible.
[18524.21s -> 18525.64s]  Treat!
[18525.64s -> 18526.44s]  We can kill this thing.
[18527.16s -> 18536.90s]  Good game.
[18536.90s -> 18537.94s]  Good game.
[18537.94s -> 18546.10s]  All the doubters, yeah.
[18546.10s -> 18548.56s]  All right.
[18548.56s -> 18549.60s]  One more, one more.
[18549.60s -> 18550.16s]  One more.
[18550.16s -> 18551.99s]  I wanna do one more.
[18551.99s -> 18562.36s]  Last one.
[18562.36s -> 18563.00s]  This is it.
[18563.00s -> 18564.53s]  It's the final game of the night.
[18564.53s -> 18566.69s]  I'm gonna do a assault.
[18566.69s -> 18583.14s]  Password is going to be...
[18583.14s -> 18593.88s]  This is all lowercase.
[18593.88s -> 18603.48s]  Lowercase only.
[18603.48s -> 18607.17s]  I'm not gonna give any hints.
[18607.17s -> 18608.05s]  I wanna see if anybody gets it.
[18614.95s -> 18618.63s]  Please tell Hashouse or GoGo to update their online hours.
[18618.63s -> 18621.51s]  I told my parents to get the blue cheeseburger that you recommended,
[18621.51s -> 18625.80s]  and they were closed even though the website said open.
[18625.80s -> 18626.68s]  Oh, shit.
[18626.68s -> 18630.80s]  Password is omega lol with no spaces, no capitals.
[18644.56s -> 18645.44s]  Yeah, all right.
[18645.44s -> 18646.16s]  I'm not...
[18646.16s -> 18648.96s]  I have no affiliation with Hashouse or GoGo.
[18648.96s -> 18649.76s]  I just like the place.
[18650.48s -> 18657.73s]  I can't, like, rent a skin.
[18658.29s -> 18665.09s]  I'm sorry.
[18665.09s -> 18668.10s]  I know Sun Wukong's moves.
[18668.10s -> 18674.74s]  I don't know Apua.
[18674.74s -> 18675.78s]  Is it Apua?
[18675.78s -> 18680.28s]  Who is that?
[18680.28s -> 18681.56s]  Is it Donkey Kong?
[18681.56s -> 18698.04s]  I can't believe you're playing this game.
[18698.04s -> 18702.20s]  The power of three people in pre-stream chat.
[18702.20s -> 18707.03s]  Don't ever feel like you cannot influence my decisions.
[18707.03s -> 18709.19s]  Actually, three or four people in pre-stream, like,
[18709.99s -> 18711.27s]  yesterday, the day before.
[18711.27s -> 18712.79s]  That's the reason why we're doing this.
[18712.79s -> 18718.39s]  These skins are insane.
[18721.94s -> 18722.42s]  Oh, boy.
[18722.42s -> 18723.22s]  This is gonna be bad.
[18725.33s -> 18730.07s]  One, two, three, three level 10 legendary players.
[18730.07s -> 18731.97s]  We have two.
[18731.97s -> 18732.77s]  Diamond servers.
[18732.77s -> 18733.41s]  Ah, you have to...
[18733.41s -> 18733.73s]  These...
[18733.73s -> 18736.93s]  Yeah, it's like 500 games.
[18736.93s -> 18738.93s]  I'm so outclassed right now.
[18738.93s -> 18745.30s]  I feel like I got rushed and carried through a place I'm not supposed to be.
[18745.86s -> 18755.80s]  What do they have?
[18756.60s -> 18758.76s]  Physical, physical, physical.
[18759.56s -> 18760.76s]  It's all physical.
[18760.76s -> 18761.56s]  All right.
[18761.56s -> 18761.96s]  Yeah.
[18761.96s -> 18762.76s]  Let's go with this.
[18762.76s -> 18763.40s]  Sovereignty.
[18771.89s -> 18773.73s]  My favorite part about this is this.
[18773.73s -> 18774.53s]  When he goes,
[18774.53s -> 18778.82s]  TRANSFORM.
[18778.82s -> 18779.78s]  Say it.
[18779.78s -> 18788.93s]  He goes,
[18788.93s -> 18790.13s]  TRANSFORM.
[18790.13s -> 18792.10s]  Yeah, I gotta get him to say it.
[18792.66s -> 18795.88s]  The tank already has sovereignty.
[18797.32s -> 18797.64s]  All right.
[18797.64s -> 18798.28s]  I'll get another one.
[18802.92s -> 18803.32s]  Say it.
[18803.88s -> 18816.82s]  Don't ever do a funny noise.
[18816.82s -> 18817.62s]  It'll make me LOL.
[18818.42s -> 18821.00s]  Did it work?
[18831.70s -> 18832.50s]  No, try again.
[18833.54s -> 18854.93s]  Did it work?
[18854.93s -> 18855.81s]  I have no mana left.
[18859.49s -> 18860.53s]  No, try again.
[18860.53s -> 18860.85s]  Again?
[18861.57s -> 18873.36s]  Careful.
[18876.08s -> 18877.28s]  TRANSFORM.
[18878.24s -> 18885.30s]  Stunning.
[18886.88s -> 18887.36s]  Stunned him.
[18895.03s -> 18895.67s]  Yes, tank.
[18896.31s -> 18900.20s]  I feel like I'm playing Kingdom Hearts.
[18904.61s -> 18921.28s]  The AI characters are just talking to each other.
[18921.28s -> 18922.08s]  Say it.
[18922.08s -> 18928.31s]  I'm just waiting for him to go.
[18928.87s -> 18929.99s]  Don't give up.
[18929.99s -> 18930.87s]  Don't give up.
[18935.33s -> 18940.85s]  Don't give up.
[18940.85s -> 18942.04s]  Sora.
[18942.04s -> 18942.52s]  Sora.
[18944.82s -> 18945.70s]  Don't give up.
[18945.70s -> 18946.18s]  Sora.
[18951.64s -> 18952.36s]  Attack.
[18953.08s -> 18954.20s]  Attack.
[18954.20s -> 18955.00s]  Attack.
[18973.46s -> 18974.34s]  They're gonna jump on us.
[18974.98s -> 18975.62s]  Don't touch me.
[18983.36s -> 18984.56s]  No, he didn't say it.
[18984.56s -> 18993.08s]  I gotta go back.
[18997.67s -> 18999.03s]  I got my help ready.
[18999.03s -> 19000.36s]  I'm ready to go in.
[19001.76s -> 19002.72s]  I'm ready to go in.
[19002.72s -> 19003.68s]  Say the word.
[19003.68s -> 19004.08s]  Say it.
[19004.08s -> 19004.40s]  It's done.
[19009.86s -> 19010.18s]  Fuck it.
[19010.18s -> 19010.50s]  Go in.
[19010.50s -> 19010.82s]  Let's go.
[19011.46s -> 19018.98s]  Clean it up.
[19018.98s -> 19028.32s]  Physical protection.
[19028.32s -> 19029.36s]  Crowd control reduction.
[19029.36s -> 19029.84s]  Oh, yeah.
[19030.56s -> 19031.04s]  Thank you.
[19031.68s -> 19035.46s]  Oh, it's that...
[19036.26s -> 19038.42s]  Is that Sir Finley Markleton?
[19039.14s -> 19054.88s]  I love how people hate that.
[19055.76s -> 19059.28s]  Can I change my bet?
[19060.66s -> 19060.98s]  We're gonna...
[19061.86s -> 19062.02s]  Oh.
[19063.94s -> 19075.91s]  Ultimate is ready.
[19075.91s -> 19077.19s]  I don't know how to do the key combination,
[19077.19s -> 19078.47s]  so I just set it on spring.
[19078.47s -> 19084.05s]  Oh, my ult's not even ready.
[19084.05s -> 19094.16s]  I don't know.
[19094.16s -> 19095.76s]  I feel like we're all larping right now.
[19096.32s -> 19107.64s]  Kill.
[19112.95s -> 19113.51s]  Uh-oh.
[19113.51s -> 19114.07s]  Uh-oh.
[19115.27s -> 19115.67s]  Uh-oh.
[19118.95s -> 19119.91s]  Watch out.
[19119.91s -> 19120.31s]  Watch out.
[19120.31s -> 19120.63s]  Watch out.
[19120.63s -> 19121.91s]  A guy's coming for you.
[19121.91s -> 19122.47s]  Watch out.
[19123.11s -> 19128.05s]  Watch out.
[19128.05s -> 19128.77s]  It's Loki.
[19129.41s -> 19133.01s]  He's a trickster.
[19135.35s -> 19135.67s]  What?
[19136.31s -> 19138.55s]  I tried to press the fucking button.
[19138.55s -> 19139.83s]  I could have killed all three of them.
[19140.39s -> 19141.17s]  If I just...
[19141.81s -> 19157.30s]  He's like a five-year-old having a tantrum.
[19158.48s -> 19159.44s]  You want to hear a tantrum?
[19159.44s -> 19160.40s]  I'll give you a tantrum.
[19160.96s -> 19166.07s]  I'll show you a tantrum.
[19182.13s -> 19192.63s]  That's a cool skin.
[19192.63s -> 19194.07s]  Oh, yep.
[19194.07s -> 19196.31s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[19197.19s -> 19197.59s]  Oh.
[19198.71s -> 19218.74s]  This is hurting me.
[19219.30s -> 19230.95s]  Whoever did that...
[19230.95s -> 19231.11s]  What?
[19231.11s -> 19231.99s]  I don't know what move that was,
[19231.99s -> 19233.35s]  but holy shit, it was good.
[19233.35s -> 19237.51s]  Let's hit...
[19238.15s -> 19248.66s]  Ice cream is on its way.
[19249.30s -> 19251.14s]  Michael's been such a good boy this year.
[19252.02s -> 19253.73s]  Open up your gift.
[19254.37s -> 19255.25s]  Probably aren't you?
[19255.97s -> 19258.23s]  I'm gonna die.
[19258.79s -> 19259.19s]  I'm dead.
[19275.27s -> 19276.85s]  I thought you got hacked.
[19284.18s -> 19284.50s]  Good.
[19284.50s -> 19285.30s]  Come on, Cerberus.
[19286.02s -> 19294.34s]  Cerberus, what?
[19294.90s -> 19296.98s]  What is the Cerberus doing?
[19300.74s -> 19301.46s]  Got it.
[19301.46s -> 19301.86s]  Finally.
[19306.07s -> 19316.58s]  We're almost at a victory here.
[19318.16s -> 19319.20s]  You gotta go out on a good one.
[19326.55s -> 19327.43s]  I got it.
[19327.43s -> 19328.63s]  As I said, that would've been embarrassing.
[19330.44s -> 19330.92s]  He's dead.
[19331.64s -> 19332.12s]  Where is he?
[19332.68s -> 19333.16s]  Is he dead?
[19333.88s -> 19335.76s]  Yeah, we got him.
[19341.28s -> 19342.00s]  Yeah.
[19342.00s -> 19353.41s]  This is dangerous.
[19353.97s -> 19355.35s]  This is too dangerous.
[19355.35s -> 19355.99s]  I don't like this.
[19356.71s -> 19357.44s]  I don't like this.
[19357.44s -> 19357.76s]  I'm out.
[19359.68s -> 19360.72s]  No, I'm leaving.
[19360.72s -> 19365.43s]  It's too scary.
[19365.43s -> 19365.99s]  There's too many.
[19366.63s -> 19368.93s]  There are too many.
[19369.49s -> 19375.41s]  I'll help you.
[19378.72s -> 19379.36s]  Oh, man.
[19380.48s -> 19400.88s]  Oh, kill this motherfucker.
[19400.88s -> 19402.98s]  He's got like no health.
[19402.98s -> 19404.02s]  Excuse me?
[19405.94s -> 19406.74s]  Why was he...
[19406.74s -> 19407.54s]  I couldn't hurt him.
[19408.10s -> 19418.05s]  I don't know what the fuck I was doing there.
[19418.77s -> 19426.88s]  Oh, no.
[19426.88s -> 19427.04s]  Stop.
[19427.04s -> 19428.00s]  I don't want that.
[19428.00s -> 19439.88s]  Favorite God, Anubis.
[19439.88s -> 19443.46s]  Stone of Fall.
[19443.46s -> 19445.40s]  It's OP on you.
[19445.40s -> 19446.76s]  Stone of Fall.
[19446.76s -> 19452.04s]  Stone of Fall?
[19452.04s -> 19453.83s]  Stone of Fall.
[19453.83s -> 19472.00s]  Kill anybody's game.
[19472.00s -> 19480.52s]  Everybody's here.
[19480.52s -> 19483.84s]  They don't have very much health.
[19483.84s -> 19486.32s]  We could really cause a little bit of a problem for them here.
[19486.32s -> 19496.31s]  Oops.
[19496.31s -> 19504.28s]  Oh, actually, that was amazing.
[19504.28s -> 19505.80s]  That guy thought I was an idiot.
[19505.80s -> 19507.65s]  I've been so...
[19507.65s -> 19508.69s]  I've been playing so poorly
[19509.25s -> 19511.41s]  that he thought the decoy was actually me.
[19511.41s -> 19512.53s]  And he's like, this is definitely Jeremy.
[19512.53s -> 19513.25s]  He's an idiot.
[19513.25s -> 19524.08s]  Ouch.
[19524.08s -> 19524.56s]  It's gonna hurt.
[19532.00s -> 19533.44s]  The ultimate long con.
[19546.42s -> 19547.30s]  That's Loki, right?
[19547.30s -> 19547.78s]  That acid.
[19548.34s -> 19551.97s]  Oh, we don't get cocky here.
[19551.97s -> 19553.65s]  We have a tower still.
[19553.65s -> 19554.85s]  We don't have to get cocky.
[19554.85s -> 19569.88s]  That's from the Loki rework.
[19569.88s -> 19589.35s]  I feel like they re-did Loki three or four times.
[19589.35s -> 19590.07s]  Cut!
[19590.07s -> 19599.06s]  Where am I going?
[19599.06s -> 19599.46s]  Where am I going?
[19599.46s -> 19600.50s]  Where am I going?
[19600.50s -> 19601.28s]  Oh, shit.
[19601.28s -> 19601.92s]  I'm in trouble.
[19605.32s -> 19625.97s]  What was I gonna buy this?
[19626.77s -> 19627.09s]  Yeah.
[19627.65s -> 19637.88s]  I think we won.
[19646.36s -> 19646.84s]  Oh, no.
[19649.40s -> 19650.44s]  Oh, no.
[19650.44s -> 19662.85s]  I keep pressing yes.
[19662.85s -> 19663.33s]  I don't know why.
[19663.33s -> 19664.21s]  I think it's funny.
[19664.21s -> 19674.23s]  All right.
[19674.23s -> 19676.63s]  Can you just, as Kuzenbo,
[19676.63s -> 19679.11s]  can you just say yes, the loud one over and over again?
[19679.11s -> 19691.65s]  Okay, cocky.
[19701.41s -> 19702.45s]  It's just sound effects.
[19705.80s -> 19709.35s]  That's just a cookie crisp.
[19711.51s -> 19712.47s]  Cookie crisp.
[19729.06s -> 19730.82s]  Oh, I was being cocky.
[19730.82s -> 19731.78s]  I was being cocky.
[19739.00s -> 19741.48s]  I am an alien character.
[19741.48s -> 19743.24s]  I am an alien.
[19743.24s -> 19746.77s]  It's me, an alien.
[19746.77s -> 19748.29s]  I am an alien character.
[19748.29s -> 19749.17s]  It's me.
[19749.17s -> 19749.67s]  Look out.
[19750.45s -> 19751.81s]  Take me to your leader.
[19751.81s -> 19753.33s]  I am an alien in every game.
[19754.21s -> 19755.65s]  In every piece of media.
[19756.21s -> 19770.87s]  Fuck it.
[19770.87s -> 19778.53s]  Don't let him out.
[19782.39s -> 19783.35s]  I turned into a lion.
[19806.56s -> 19812.23s]  I don't want to.
[19812.23s -> 19812.71s]  My KD.
[19812.71s -> 19813.19s]  My KD.
[19813.19s -> 19814.07s]  Somebody else die.
[19814.07s -> 19817.22s]  My KD.
[19817.22s -> 19818.18s]  I don't want my KD.
[19818.18s -> 19818.82s]  My KD is bad.
[19819.38s -> 19832.36s]  Get him.
[19832.36s -> 19833.16s]  Hit this guy.
[19833.72s -> 19834.36s]  Hit the guy.
[19836.20s -> 19849.25s]  One more.
[19849.25s -> 19853.59s]  All right.
[19853.59s -> 19853.91s]  One more.
[19853.91s -> 19855.43s]  But this one's gonna be a comedy one.
[19855.43s -> 19871.40s]  The last one.
[19871.40s -> 19898.47s]  Here we go.
[19898.47s -> 19900.60s]  This is the last one.
[19900.60s -> 19905.44s]  This one you're seeing right now is going to be the last one.
[19905.44s -> 19913.36s]  Last one.
[19913.36s -> 19916.77s]  Asper was the last one.
[19916.77s -> 19917.57s]  Thanks for playing.
[19925.99s -> 19926.71s]  I don't know.
[19926.71s -> 19930.72s]  I'm gonna re-roll.
[19930.72s -> 19932.16s]  I can't re-roll.
[19932.16s -> 19937.52s]  I thought you could.
[19937.52s -> 19938.40s]  Sure.
[19938.40s -> 19940.90s]  I'll play Sun Wukong.
[19940.90s -> 19974.90s]  No, that's too much pressure.
[19974.90s -> 19976.18s]  They have voice lines too.
[19984.63s -> 19985.83s]  I don't know if you should do a bet for this one.
[19985.83s -> 19987.62s]  This could be anybody's game.
[19987.62s -> 19988.42s]  It's just...
[19988.42s -> 19993.19s]  Everyone's gonna be level 20 with 100,000 gold.
[19993.19s -> 19995.73s]  It's gonna be an absolute nightmare.
[19995.73s -> 19996.93s]  We already won.
[19996.93s -> 20000.71s]  We win.
[20000.71s -> 20003.43s]  Osiris Horus Bakasura.
[20004.23s -> 20004.79s]  Yeah.
[20004.79s -> 20022.53s]  If we don't win this game, come on.
[20022.53s -> 20026.12s]  Although, find out.
[20031.43s -> 20031.93s]  All right.
[20032.79s -> 20033.51s]  This.
[20034.61s -> 20037.76s]  What do they got?
[20037.76s -> 20042.37s]  They got a lot of physical, physical, physical, physical.
[20043.01s -> 20044.13s]  Yeah, all physical.
[20044.13s -> 20045.73s]  Just build only physical protection.
[20054.47s -> 20058.58s]  Are we getting that?
[20058.58s -> 20067.01s]  I got it.
[20067.01s -> 20067.51s]  Okay.
[20073.89s -> 20074.13s]  Sure.
[20074.13s -> 20074.63s]  Whatever you say.
[20087.56s -> 20088.44s]  No comedy gamble?
[20096.29s -> 20099.01s]  I still have to damage them?
[20099.01s -> 20100.69s]  Or what if I just stay alive permanently?
[20100.69s -> 20101.33s]  What if we just...
[20101.33s -> 20102.29s]  Let's go in the tower now.
[20102.77s -> 20105.01s]  Let's just take the tower right now.
[20106.05s -> 20107.89s]  Why would we not just take the tower right now?
[20107.89s -> 20109.73s]  Let's go.
[20109.73s -> 20110.37s]  Take the tower now.
[20110.37s -> 20110.87s]  Go.
[20111.25s -> 20118.20s]  All right.
[20118.20s -> 20119.80s]  Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[20119.80s -> 20120.30s]  We got it.
[20120.84s -> 20131.81s]  All right.
[20131.81s -> 20132.31s]  Everybody out.
[20135.67s -> 20137.50s]  Shit.
[20138.04s -> 20139.32s]  Oh, we're gonna lose.
[20144.42s -> 20144.92s]  I forgot...
[20147.11s -> 20151.83s]  I forgot that we all have a 60 second timer.
[20163.12s -> 20164.80s]  No, this doesn't count.
[20164.80s -> 20166.23s]  That doesn't count.
[20166.79s -> 20180.47s]  Are you gonna leave it alive?
[20180.47s -> 20181.35s]  Oh, you...
[20181.35s -> 20181.85s]  Okay.
[20182.33s -> 20186.57s]  They won't want to keep this going.
[20186.57s -> 20196.39s]  That's the biggest mistake they ever made.
[20196.39s -> 20197.35s]  That was a big mistake.
[20209.50s -> 20214.94s]  As long as we move as a party, we're gonna be fine.
[20221.93s -> 20223.29s]  Oh, excuse me.
[20223.29s -> 20224.01s]  What just happened?
[20226.54s -> 20229.42s]  Why did they all do the Warcraft 3 town portal?
[20230.14s -> 20230.64s]  What?
[20235.93s -> 20237.29s]  Since when is that in the game?
[20248.12s -> 20250.79s]  Horus's ult can do that.
[20250.79s -> 20251.43s]  Oh, no.
[20261.88s -> 20262.60s]  Oh, no.
[20271.90s -> 20272.86s]  It's still winnable?
[20273.50s -> 20274.00s]  Yeah, it is.
[20279.36s -> 20282.33s]  Our characters are way better for this composition.
[20282.33s -> 20286.49s]  We just need to not get teleported on.
[20295.37s -> 20296.25s]  Double mercy.
[20301.84s -> 20307.21s]  Well, there's no feeding because everyone's level 20 and has infinite gold.
[20307.21s -> 20308.01s]  There's no feeding.
[20308.01s -> 20310.17s]  It's just who has a better team comp at this point.
[20310.17s -> 20312.38s]  We just have to win one team fight.
[20312.38s -> 20314.27s]  We can do it.
[20314.27s -> 20324.52s]  Are they gonna do that again?
[20324.52s -> 20325.02s]  No.
[20334.80s -> 20335.30s]  All right.
[20335.30s -> 20335.76s]  No, no, no.
[20335.76s -> 20336.56s]  Look, he's got half health.
[20339.15s -> 20340.35s]  They're all waiting on the right side.
[20340.35s -> 20340.91s]  They're already...
[20340.91s -> 20341.79s]  Look, they're right here.
[20344.00s -> 20344.50s]  I...
[20345.20s -> 20349.48s]  Wait, how'd they get behind us?
[20380.67s -> 20381.17s]  Come here.
[20381.95s -> 20388.67s]  He's gonna jump around.
[20388.67s -> 20390.65s]  I'm gonna cut him off this way.
[20390.65s -> 20394.57s]  Fuck him.
[20394.57s -> 20394.81s]  Fuck him.
[20394.81s -> 20395.37s]  Just go to the tower.
[20395.37s -> 20395.87s]  Who cares?
[20412.57s -> 20413.07s]  Ah!
[20414.57s -> 20422.16s]  Oh, I thought that was high.
[20422.80s -> 20431.88s]  Remember, your viewer count retreated.
[20431.88s -> 20432.20s]  It's...
[20432.20s -> 20432.60s]  I don't...
[20432.60s -> 20433.16s]  It's fine.
[20433.16s -> 20435.26s]  I don't care.
[20435.26s -> 20435.90s]  I don't care.
[20437.79s -> 20440.67s]  I'm surprised that more than 5k people stuck around to watch
[20441.23s -> 20443.63s]  a fucking dingus play smite for five hours.
[20444.27s -> 20454.19s]  We got all five?
[20462.09s -> 20462.97s]  No, it's all good.
[20463.93s -> 20466.49s]  Look, I know a lot of people are not into these games.
[20467.37s -> 20468.09s]  It's fine.
[20468.09s -> 20468.49s]  It's cool.
[20470.16s -> 20471.20s]  I get it completely.
[20471.20s -> 20472.00s]  Don't worry.
[20472.00s -> 20481.85s]  We just need somebody to overextend for a second and we'll win the game.
[20481.85s -> 20483.45s]  One of them's gonna get super cocky.
[20483.45s -> 20484.25s]  They're gonna get up here.
[20484.25s -> 20485.61s]  They're gonna try to attack and run away.
[20485.61s -> 20487.13s]  We're gonna collapse on them.
[20487.13s -> 20494.25s]  Uh-oh.
[20494.25s -> 20495.77s]  Someone's getting a little cocky.
[20496.41s -> 20497.96s]  Getting a little bored.
[20497.96s -> 20498.92s]  Wants to make something happen.
[20499.40s -> 20505.37s]  There it is!
[20505.37s -> 20505.77s]  There it is!
[20505.77s -> 20506.09s]  There it is!
[20506.09s -> 20506.97s]  There it is!
[20506.97s -> 20507.79s]  Run away.
[20507.79s -> 20508.11s]  Never mind.
[20508.11s -> 20508.67s]  Run away.
[20508.67s -> 20509.31s]  Run away.
[20509.31s -> 20509.71s]  Never mind.
[20529.55s -> 20530.75s]  Oh my god.
[20530.75s -> 20531.47s]  What the hell?
[20531.47s -> 20533.39s]  Why do they all get Star Trek themed?
[20544.06s -> 20544.62s]  Oh god.
[20545.34s -> 20545.98s]  We're in trouble.
[20577.12s -> 20577.36s]  All right.
[20577.36s -> 20580.24s]  That's it.
[20580.24s -> 20581.12s]  That's it.
[20581.12s -> 20581.68s]  That was fun.
[20582.60s -> 20585.72s]  Except for when I played the one game of Conquest that was not fun.
[20587.20s -> 20588.16s]  It wasn't its own way.
[20596.84s -> 20598.20s]  That was uh smite.
[20598.20s -> 20600.48s]  It's a fun game.
[20600.48s -> 20603.12s]  I recommend you play it if you like those kinds of games.
[20603.76s -> 20607.88s]  That was smite Thursdays.
[20607.88s -> 20609.00s]  Next Thursday.
[20609.00s -> 20611.00s]  You're not gonna see this ever again.
[20611.64s -> 20619.05s]  We will only play smite again if I can get some more...
[20619.05s -> 20623.66s]  I was gonna say skins.
[20624.62s -> 20626.06s]  That's all that matters.
[20629.20s -> 20630.24s]  Maybe you'll see it again.
[20630.24s -> 20631.52s]  It's fun just to fuck around.
[20632.08s -> 20637.56s]  Join my game clan.
[20637.56s -> 20637.72s]  No.
[20641.92s -> 20642.56s]  That's gonna be it.
[20645.37s -> 20647.53s]  So I will see you guys on probably Monday or Tuesday.
[20647.53s -> 20649.05s]  Check the sus the next day or two.
[20649.05s -> 20652.54s]  We are gonna play...
[20652.54s -> 20653.50s]  What did I say we're gonna play?
[20654.06s -> 20654.86s]  Something really specific.
[20654.86s -> 20661.79s]  What was it?
[20661.79s -> 20662.51s]  GTA, right.
[20662.51s -> 20664.35s]  We'll play Grand Theft Auto online.
[20664.35s -> 20673.61s]  And then we're gonna prepare the...
[20673.61s -> 20676.17s]  We'll prepare some more public domain movie stuff for Halloween.
[20676.17s -> 20692.19s]  What about Paladins?
[20692.19s -> 20692.91s]  Eh, I don't think so.
[20695.08s -> 20695.40s]  But yeah.
[20695.40s -> 20697.72s]  I'll see you guys in three or four days or so.
[20697.72s -> 20700.14s]  See you soon.
[20700.14s -> 20703.40s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[20703.40s -> 20706.44s]  I know it's not one of those games that a lot of people really want to sit down and watch.
[20706.44s -> 20707.74s]  I know.
[20707.74s -> 20711.02s]  But I figured we'd play some viewer games and just hang out for four or five hours.
[20711.02s -> 20712.94s]  So that's exactly what we did.
[20712.94s -> 20717.40s]  See you in a few days.
[20717.40s -> 20718.52s]  Thanks for watching guys.
[20718.52s -> 20725.10s]  Take care of yourselves.
[20725.10s -> 20725.98s]  Always a pleasure.
[20725.98s -> 20735.48s]  Oh, I also got something else to tell you about too.
[20735.48s -> 20741.45s]  We are going to get incoming some new BloorDow music.
[20741.45s -> 20743.69s]  And some new emotes and animated emotes.
[20743.69s -> 20745.45s]  BloorDow's gonna make a bunch of stuff.
[20745.45s -> 20749.31s]  As you know, BloorDow has made all the music you've heard on this channel.
[20749.31s -> 20751.42s]  These original music.
[20751.42s -> 20752.56s]  We're gonna get some more tracks.
[20753.12s -> 20754.96s]  I'm incredibly excited for that.
[20754.96s -> 20759.21s]  Because it's very, very obvious.
[20759.21s -> 20760.09s]  I don't even need to state this.
[20760.09s -> 20761.45s]  BloorDow's music.
[20761.45s -> 20762.33s]  All of them bangers.
[20762.33s -> 20766.04s]  All of them.
[20766.04s -> 20767.16s]  New sub badges as well.
[20767.16s -> 20767.64s]  That's right.
[20767.64s -> 20779.02s]  You're a funny fellow.
[20779.02s -> 20785.53s]  Hey, thanks.
[20785.53s -> 20786.65s]  Not the dollhouse theme.
[20786.65s -> 20786.89s]  No.
[20786.89s -> 20789.37s]  That's the one thing the original song that BloorDow did not make.
[20790.01s -> 20792.89s]  But we're gonna get another probably two or three new tracks.
[20792.89s -> 20800.33s]  We're still working on what the sub badges are gonna be.
[20800.33s -> 20803.21s]  Because there's years worth of subs now.
[20803.29s -> 20808.00s]  How does it feel to be a soulless streamer?
[20808.00s -> 20808.50s]  What?
[20810.25s -> 20811.21s]  Am I soulless?
[20811.21s -> 20815.44s]  I hope none of you think that.
[20815.44s -> 20817.36s]  You really think I'm a soulless guy?
[20817.36s -> 20818.32s]  I hope not.
[20818.32s -> 20823.87s]  I think I have a soul.
[20823.87s -> 20824.67s]  I think so.
[20824.67s -> 20826.83s]  That's like the glowy thing that's in the middle of your chest, right?
[20836.91s -> 20838.84s]  Thanks for subbing as always.
[20838.84s -> 20840.38s]  Thanks everybody.
[20840.38s -> 20841.74s]  We'll see you in a few days.
[20841.74s -> 20842.62s]  Thanks for playing Smite.
[20842.62s -> 20843.58s]  Thanks for humoring me.
[20843.58s -> 20846.06s]  Because this is not something I typically will do on this channel.
[20846.78s -> 20851.37s]  Thanks for watching nonetheless.
[20851.37s -> 20930.41s]  We'll see you soon.
